[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.10]I love my wonderful friends.
[00:06.07]Good afternoon.
[00:08.23]Hope you're having a good day.
[00:16.88]I'm just hanging out.
[00:19.14]I'm just having a good time.
[00:24.52]Let's see.
[00:27.10]There we go.
[00:27.76]Hey, why don't we change the music?
[00:31.33]Yeah, let's change the music a little bit today.
[00:38.11]Those of you that weren't out here a couple days ago.
[00:39.50]This is the intro song.
[00:43.28]To Monster Rancher 4, I don't know why.
[00:44.96]What if this was just my intro?
[00:55.73]Stream's starting soon guys, see you in a minute.
[01:36.35]I can kind of do it again.
[01:37.31]I thought my cough was kind of back.
[01:38.79]Remember I couldn't do that last week?
[01:45.57]Hey!
[01:46.77]That's what you've been hearing.
[01:47.59]That's been the intro to Monster Hunter 4.
[01:49.39]We're going to continue where we left off.
[01:53.07]We had three wonderful little babies that are starting to grow up into adults.
[02:02.60]And they're probably going to die really soon, so don't get too attached.
[02:08.57]But, yeah, I was out last night.
[02:12.39]I took Kim out.
[02:13.79]It was her birthday weekend, so we went out.
[02:16.39]Yeah, birthday weekend.
[02:17.23]It always is birthday week.
[02:21.47]We ended up being able to take the same amount of time off because she works too.
[02:25.87]So we ended up being able to go out last night.
[02:28.35]It was really fun.
[02:28.95]It was great.
[02:29.99]But the only problem is I have, like, made my sickness come back.
[02:34.91]I'm coughing again, which sucks because I was just over it.
[02:40.18]Well, what can you do?
[02:46.91]But I'm not saying... I think it's just... I just caused it to come back for a minute.
[02:54.57]I don't know.
[02:55.25]Something's going on.
[02:55.97]Something is going around.
[03:00.43]I probably got sick with something else.
[03:03.05]Oh, I'd be so pissed.
[03:05.37]Sick forever.
[03:07.01]I just keep getting a different strand of the cold.
[03:12.50]Anyways, let's go right where we left off.
[03:15.04]Welcome, everybody.
[03:21.42]I've been sick since I swallowed the semen, Mike.
[03:24.88]I know.
[03:26.62]That's fucked up.
[03:27.56]I'm going to have to go to the doctor and be like, why have I been sick for like three weeks?
[03:38.75]I never get sick like this.
[03:39.91]You guys know that.
[03:41.64]Maybe like once or twice, maybe once a year, I will get sick like this.
[03:46.16]Like coughing and... No.
[03:50.56]Never.
[03:53.03]I have a bunch of other problems.
[03:55.19]But I never get sick.
[04:02.25]It was your first winter in Vegas.
[04:03.85]That's true.
[04:10.31]It was the Mike and the raw pizza.
[04:13.51]No, it was not raw pizza.
[04:19.31]I'd say it's Vroomer.
[04:21.11]I'll catch everybody up that wasn't paying attention last time.
[04:24.01]Maybe you fell asleep because of a reticent sleeper.
[04:27.43]Or maybe you were just not here.
[04:29.01]These are our three monsters.
[04:31.33]We have Wall-E, Roberto, and Vroomer.
[04:35.75]Vroomer is the best currently, but I think Roberto is going to be passing him very soon.
[04:45.66]But Wall-E, I think, is on their way out.
[04:49.26]They're not very good.
[04:50.32]They're causing problems.
[04:52.34]This thing sucks, I'll be honest.
[04:56.58]But its cute factor brings it to like an 8.
[04:59.92]So its usefulness is like a 4.
[05:03.76]But look at that dance.
[05:08.05]We could try fusing Wally with somebody.
[05:11.51]How about this?
[05:11.93]This is what we're gonna do.
[05:14.23]We're gonna say goodbye to Wally.
[05:18.28]But we're not gonna say bye.
[05:19.50]We're gonna say hello to their fresh DNA.
[05:23.48]And we're gonna fuse them with somebody else.
[05:25.84]Because we're gonna put some more CDs in.
[05:36.41]Give him... I'm a monster.
[05:42.72]Let me... Alright, hold on.
[05:43.64]Here's what's gonna happen.
[05:45.46]Let me see... No, no, no, don't do that.
[05:48.36]Let's take a look at the calendar.
[05:51.66]I didn't win in the D rank.
[05:54.06]I got cheesed by the enemy.
[05:57.00]They resurrected twice.
[05:59.28]But I... I think you unlock more monsters when somebody gets up here.
[06:06.52]So we were almost here, but I got screwed.
[06:10.62]So unfortunately we gotta go back and do that again.
[06:13.30]Uh, that was kind of an annoying moment, but whatever.
[06:17.05]Uh, for the time being, I think... It's time.
[06:25.79]It's time to freeze Wall-E.
[06:28.68]It's very... We have, uh, look, we're gonna have them forever.
[06:38.79]Everyone's going to be very upset about this.
[06:44.29]Just wait longer?
[06:46.71]Um... I kind of want to put in some more CDs.
[06:55.92]And while it... Let's be honest here.
[06:59.94]I want to see a couple more CDs worth of monsters.
[07:03.68]And... Wally's just the weakest link out of the three of them.
[07:07.94]That's just the way it is.
[07:12.48]Uh, HighKingMilk.
[07:14.78]10 community subs.
[07:19.82]What is it with Monster Rancher 4 and community subs?
[07:22.04]Right off the bat, 10.
[07:23.78]Thank you, HighKingMilk.
[07:28.54]Ugh.
[07:30.28]His intelligence is so high, but everything, he's just not very... His... Let me take a look at this.
[07:43.21]So this is 216, 199, 200.
[07:43.53]But better moves.
[07:43.93]This is 242, 139, 182.
[07:45.13]Alright, maybe not.
[07:58.00]Maybe if I just increase his accuracy, he'll be good.
[08:06.26]Roberto is just... doesn't have high stats, but the moves are just... they hit so often and they're so good.
[08:17.93]Maybe Vroomer.
[08:18.77]Vroomer sucks.
[08:21.02]No.
[08:21.82]I've said that about all three of them.
[08:23.22]They're all good.
[08:29.42]Look, Vroomer is almost a year and three months old.
[08:33.25]And Roberto is about to pass them.
[08:36.91]You understand?
[08:38.83]Both rank D. He's not even one.
[08:42.29]It might be time to put Vroomer on ice.
[08:53.76]Alright, I'm going to give it a couple more weeks.
[08:56.41]If...
[08:57.87]Vroomer and Wally can prove in the next two or three weeks of training that they're worth keeping around, then I'll keep them.
[09:06.75]One of them's gonna... I'm telling you, one or two of them are gone.
[09:12.17]We can even combine them.
[09:14.87]I could combine Vroomer with, like, Roberto or with Wally.
[09:19.51]Alright, let's see what we got for schedule.
[09:28.49]You know what, fuck it.
[09:30.03]I'm gonna combine the two of them.
[09:31.80]Let's go.
[09:35.48]Roberto is our... our ranked player.
[09:38.22]We're just gonna mess with DNA now.
[09:42.55]Look, the game is saved, so if this sucks, I'll just say it's coming.
[09:51.53]Goodbye, broomer.
[10:04.11]See, he's happy.
[10:04.75]Alright, now let's retire Wall-E.
[10:11.27]And we're going to fuse them together.
[10:14.37]We're gonna get a nut on a wheel.
[10:16.45]How do you guys not think that's cool?
[10:18.72]I do.
[10:19.86]It's cool, man.
[10:28.40]You're gonna get a Pinwheel.
[10:29.80]Alright, here we go.
[10:30.86]Combine.
[10:34.83]Let's see.
[10:37.05]We still have these idiots here.
[10:38.21]Alright, Vroomer.
[10:40.97]And Wall-E.
[10:45.70]What happens?
[10:48.78]Skunk Roller.
[10:52.52]And Su- Suzu-ri-cho.
[11:00.71]Sprite?
[11:06.82]Uh, the base stats are not really that good.
[11:15.45]Skunk Roller.
[11:19.81]Wind Lore.
[11:20.47]Backspin.
[11:21.03]It's just a wheel.
[11:23.46]Attack and... Yeah, I don't know.
[11:31.20]These both sound like Twitch emotes.
[11:38.38]Let's do it!
[11:39.32]Let's see what happens.
[11:40.14]I'll save Scummon.
[11:50.95]Okay, well Vroomer just consumed... That's just Vroomer.
[11:57.24]Vroomer... Vroom... was unfrozen and ate the walnut and then just walked out.
[12:05.44]No.
[12:11.16]Vroomer and... What about... Okay, what about High Intelligence?
[12:14.74]What about Wonka and Wall-E?
[12:26.55]Mushtan.
[12:28.75]Pumpkin Plant.
[12:31.97]Pumpkin Plant has actually pretty high... Actually, Mushtan does too.
[12:39.91]Look at the health on Mushtan.
[12:46.61]That's not bad base stats.
[12:55.83]Mushtan.
[12:56.17]Let's see, what do you look?
[12:56.91]It's a plant, right?
[13:03.19]No!
[13:03.99]No!
[13:04.99]No, we've seen it already.
[13:06.47]I don't want this.
[13:08.39]Oh my god.
[13:25.47]I kind of have to keep this one.
[13:32.09]How about... Wally Wonka.
[13:40.53]No.
[13:45.91]Shroomer.
[13:46.53]We already had a Shroomer.
[13:52.41]How about like... Prove it to me.
[13:56.74]Yeah, that's a good name.
[13:58.26]Come on.
[13:58.68]Pruvito.
[13:59.35]Pruvitumi.
[14:26.17]That's worse than hashtag V. Yeah, I know how to spell prove it, guys.
[14:33.64]Look, it needs to fit in, like, this tiny amount of characters that can fit here.
[14:44.06]Prove it to me.
[14:47.84]Prove to me.
[14:49.04]Prove to me.
[14:51.64]No, that sucks.
[14:52.72]That's worse than what I did.
[15:21.82]Prover.
[15:31.47]Let's see if they can prove it.
[15:32.55]Let's get a couple of discs in here.
[15:43.50]High base stats though.
[15:44.88]That's good.
[15:47.87]Alright, prover.
[15:49.71]Uh, I need to go back.
[15:51.50]We got Roberto.
[15:54.28]Uh, shrine.
[15:55.46]Let's get... Let's get some more discs in here.
[16:01.76]Roberto's gonna climb the ranks real fast, so don't worry about losing progress there.
[16:06.10]All you really need is just one.
[16:10.43]Create.
[16:12.19]Alright, from a saucer.
[16:15.13]What's going in?
[16:15.61]What do you think?
[16:16.16]Uh, I've got... Some more over here.
[16:28.55]Put in Dark Souls?
[16:29.41]I don't think... I don't even own Dark Souls.
[16:32.09]The actual physical copy.
[16:33.23]I don't think I have any of them.
[16:35.19]How about Dynamite Cop?
[16:36.29]Or Space Channel 5 is down here, too.
[16:41.06]Let's put in Space Ch... Uh, Dynamite Cop.
[16:44.01]There, I'll prove it.
[16:45.61]Hey, don't worry.
[16:46.45]I'll be a prover.
[16:48.75]How do I look today?
[16:49.41]Probably bad.
[16:53.47]No, not that bad.
[16:57.01]Here.
[16:59.87]Dynamite Cop.
[17:01.12]For the Dreamcast.
[17:01.74]Going in.
[17:11.24]Insert CD into the disk tray.
[17:19.09]After this, I'll put Red Vox in after this.
[17:29.31]It's gonna be a Shroomer.
[17:31.68]If it is, then I'm just gonna accept fate and just wait till we unlock more.
[17:38.96]You got some real good McDonald's M hair today.
[17:57.44]I should just spray paint with the spray color of my hair.
[18:05.24]Yellow in the front there.
[18:06.12]Alright, here we go.
[18:08.60]Oh, by the way, I have something to talk about.
[18:10.46]I got approval from somebody at Twitch.
[18:15.48]The scratch ticket charity stream is going to happen.
[18:20.32]Probably in the next couple days.
[18:22.76]For the deaths in Sekiro...
[18:26.33]Oh my fucking god, it's fate.
[18:27.85]I'm just gonna play.
[18:34.31]Well, should I just take them both?
[18:41.36]Let's try a different one.
[18:42.24]Let's try Space Channel.
[18:52.16]Give me a break.
[18:56.69]Is it because they're Dreamcast and all Dreamcast games are the same game?
[19:02.37]Well, this is not even a Dreamcast game, so that's fine.
[19:05.19]Space Channel 5, this is the one that was... This is the bootleg one, isn't it?
[19:09.82]So... You know what I mean?
[19:12.96]This is the bootleg one.
[19:14.82]This is not even a SEGA Dreamcast game.
[19:16.36]This is somebody, like, burnt this on their fucking Windows 2000 computer.
[19:30.57]Something.
[19:36.43]Something that's not the mushroom guy.
[19:42.16]I would be, it's gonna be the mushroom, it's gonna be Dreamcast, because all the Dreamcast games have the same internal seed or something.
[19:49.82]I'm gonna have to grab other discs that are not Dreamcast.
[19:58.83]Okay.
[20:10.56]Dreamcast uses proprietary code.
[20:13.90]So maybe it is.
[20:15.36]Maybe you can't pull data from Dreamcast.
[20:30.99]Okay, come on.
[20:31.93]No, something different.
[20:37.81]The fungus is a catch-all for any disk that's too new.
[20:40.69]Oh.
[20:42.39]I'm gonna have to get some old shit.
[20:45.17]I got some old shit here.
[20:50.32]It's a meat vroomer.
[20:51.26]Alright.
[20:53.18]We just replaced this one.
[20:54.32]We just replaced the vroomer with meat vroomer.
[21:03.00]It's just Cheeto-dusted vroomer.
[21:04.74]We already talked about this.
[21:06.82]Upgraded.
[21:14.87]Uh... No.
[21:19.76]No, no, no.
[21:20.78]I'm putting in Red Vox.
[21:25.80]Red Vox is about to go in.
[21:35.51]And then, like somebody said, you might as well just grind up to rank A. I got a really good monster to grind up to rank A.
[21:45.94]We're just steamrolling all the competitions.
[21:53.56]Let's get this here.
[21:56.18]Too new?
[21:56.72]We'll just use standard DVDs and CDs and PS1 and PS2 discs.
[22:00.84]Copy protection doesn't affect those.
[22:03.40]Interesting.
[22:03.82]But here is Redbox.
[22:10.28]It's a great CD.
[22:15.67]Red Vox, come on.
[22:17.05]Give us something here.
[22:19.79]This is a regular CD, DVD.
[22:23.14]It's not like a protected code from Dreamcast.
[22:28.16]Much like Vinny coming here and goes, Oh, actually, we use the protected code, man.
[22:31.91]You're going to get a fucking shroomer.
[22:46.63]Alright, what is it?
[22:47.99]Something cool.
[22:48.63]Come on.
[22:56.24]To get a monster with higher stats, the two monsters you're combining need to be friends.
[23:02.24]What?
[23:03.62]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[23:04.56]To get a monster with higher stats, the two monsters you're combining need to be friends.
[23:10.88]You can see how good of friends they are by going into the Breeder tab and going to the last page.
[23:17.62]What?
[23:18.92]How can you be friends when you're frozen and dead?
[23:22.68]I don't know how that works.
[23:29.21]Katie!
[23:29.65]Five community subs.
[23:30.39]Thank you, Katie.
[23:31.67]Welcome back.
[23:34.97]Katie, give him more subs.
[23:38.55]Thank you so much, Katie.
[23:40.59]Now we got a Robo Bunny.
[23:46.46]Uh, yeah.
[23:53.65]Yeah, we're taking this monster home.
[23:58.45]We got a farm full of robots.
[24:02.01]You're gonna have a mech squad.
[24:03.67]Alright, how about... It's a... X-Bunny.
[24:10.79]No.
[24:12.81]Bunny.
[24:21.58]The Energizer Rabbit.
[24:23.22]Did the Energizer Rabbit have a name?
[24:27.24]I like Energizer.
[24:33.45]It was Vunny.
[24:34.17]No, it was not.
[24:39.77]Five more community subs from Katie.
[24:41.41]Thank you, Katie.
[24:42.77]Again, ten now.
[24:44.96]How about, uh, how about Vroomer?
[24:48.87]How about Energizer?
[24:51.37]Like this.
[24:51.81]The Energizer.
[24:53.29]Energize... Energize sleep.
[25:28.54]Alright, Energize, who's a little sleepy.
[25:35.21]Alright, let's go to the ranch.
[25:35.99]We got some new stuff.
[25:37.85]It's time.
[25:48.83]So here are the two.
[25:49.69]We got Energize, Pruver, and Roberto.
[25:55.17]Roberto's sole purpose is to grind tournaments.
[25:58.77]These two are going to just relax.
[26:00.85]I don't care.
[26:01.68]They're not joining any tournaments.
[26:04.30]Let me take... Wait, wait, wait.
[26:05.16]Let's just hold that thought.
[26:12.50]Mmm... Meh.
[26:16.40]You guys just rest and eat and just go to training.
[26:21.35]You are going to grind tournaments.
[26:32.11]Uh... And each rank unlocks more monster fusion types.
[26:35.23]So after D, new races unlock as possible on the discs you put in.
[26:38.69]Alright, cool.
[26:40.37]So let's run it down.
[26:40.93]It's gonna grind up tournaments.
[26:43.18]When's the next one?
[26:44.80]More community stuff from KD.
[26:47.82]My god.
[26:48.82]Thank you, KD.
[26:50.66]For your... Every five minutes.
[26:54.65]There's a tournament today?
[26:56.19]Let's go.
[26:57.68]Join it.
[26:58.20]Roberto.
[26:59.04]He's ready.
[27:01.66]Just crush the competition.
[27:03.28]He's so good.
[27:07.12]And you guys, who gives a shit?
[27:10.46]You can just do whatever you want.
[27:17.43]Uh, no.
[27:17.79]Automatic for Technique.
[27:23.41]and U automatic for speed.
[27:28.81]Yeah, who cares?
[27:29.71]They're just DNA.
[27:34.21]Roberto's gonna do life training today.
[27:35.59]It's a little quiet, I'll turn it up.
[27:44.85]Nine health from Roberto, that's good.
[27:51.74]Kill or be killed?
[27:54.79]You're doing just good, let's give you some food.
[27:56.65]Because we have to just grind turnips.
[27:59.91]Oh shit, I'm out of food.
[28:01.43]Uh, you can use squid today, I'll go buy some food tomorrow.
[28:05.68]Let's see how funny- okay, depending on how funny and cute they are.
[28:20.50]You're a lot- you're a lot bigger than I thought you were.
[28:24.48]I hate this thing so much.
[28:27.28]I really hope that that stupid mushroom is not the most powerful thing we have.
[28:30.82]That would be so upset.
[28:38.28]We all love him.
[28:39.16]No, you don't.
[28:41.55]I can't wait to see you in the chat in an hour or two.
[28:46.15]Burn him!
[28:47.15]Just eat him!
[28:48.07]Ice him!
[28:48.69]Kill that fucking stupid thing!
[28:50.25]It's gonna be everywhere.
[28:59.84]It's the dumbest monster that we've ever seen.
[29:01.79]And there's gonna be an argument in chat.
[29:04.09]I don't know why you guys think that.
[29:05.31]Like, why do you think that?
[29:06.15]Like, at that person's name.
[29:08.77]Like, are you stupid?
[29:10.17]Don't do that.
[29:10.71]Let's not get fucking upset about this, please.
[29:19.83]I see that you've only been a follower of the channel for like two months.
[29:24.22]I was here when Beanbag Sonic was created.
[29:25.94]You don't know shit, idiot.
[29:28.12]And then that person's gonna be like, fuck you, man.
[29:29.78]It's gonna cause problems.
[29:30.52]Don't do that.
[29:41.62]Alright, what do you got?
[29:43.80]Nothing.
[29:44.14]I don't even need to look at the stats.
[29:46.64]Roberto is too good.
[29:52.78]I see you've only been a follower for two months.
[29:54.50]I was here when Beanbag Sonic was created.
[29:58.52]Look at that thing!
[30:02.56]Why can't I get Cut Man from Mega Man?
[30:04.32]That's not fair.
[30:09.40]Don't worry.
[30:13.13]It really is Cut Man.
[30:16.07]Alright, it's alright.
[30:20.21]He's a little rusty.
[30:22.74]98 damage.
[30:23.22]Let's do it again.
[30:25.12]Grind Tornadoes.
[30:27.30]This is such a high hit percentage.
[30:29.34]Surprises are missing.
[30:30.80]Really.
[30:31.06]There.
[30:31.58]Just need to do three of these and we can get the sequel.
[30:45.45]Guy versus Ghassan.
[30:49.56]Ghassan wins.
[30:53.81]And then the championship is Gassan.
[30:55.63]This is one of those big rocks.
[30:58.46]Lots of life, pretty good defense, just kind of have to not get hit.
[31:02.54]That'll be easy.
[31:06.76]Guy Gassan was a French revolutionary, I think.
[31:14.11]Guy Gassan.
[31:18.07]Alright, big purple monster.
[31:23.78]Bingo.
[31:25.95]And then we can go with the shoulder tackle.
[31:32.41]If you don't think we're going to grind up the tournaments and win them.
[31:35.21]With Roberto.
[31:36.64]It was a long shot with Vroomer because Vroomer didn't have very good accuracy.
[31:41.96]I should win all these up to rank C or B.
[31:55.69]One final tip from the Monster Rancher expert.
[31:59.29]A good trick is to get the house that allows you to have four monsters, have three you don't care about doing exploring, and one you use to get your rank up.
[32:08.97]Alright.
[32:09.79]Well, I'm already meeting you halfway there, because I already don't care about the other two.
[32:14.18]So, I'm already getting to that point.
[32:24.24]I miss Wall-E.
[32:27.20]But you gotta move on.
[32:39.33]Alright, so... Let's go to the calendar.
[32:43.71]The next tournament here is for Roberto.
[32:47.88]Sign you up for that one.
[32:48.66]Just do every single one I can do in a row.
[32:51.90]That's at least Rank D. Now, the other two are gonna just go on a walk.
[33:01.14]Uh, hold on.
[33:02.44]Let me take a look at this.
[33:05.04]So, you... Let me do... Might as well just do intelligence.
[33:09.90]Just make it at least look like you're trying.
[33:14.77]And then speed.
[33:16.37]I don't have anything to speed.
[33:18.65]Uh, accuracy.
[33:23.07]And what did you have, Roberto?
[33:23.99]You can sleep?
[33:24.83]No, you're good.
[33:25.93]I think you can do life again, right?
[33:31.33]Yep, Lifeblade, then Rest.
[33:35.67]I think I should, maybe I should bring them all exploring.
[33:37.99]Because Roberto's almost level 5.
[33:39.19]Oh, I need food.
[33:46.46]I'll go to town this week.
[33:52.12]Does he, he does that with his ears, weirdly enough.
[33:55.21]Alright, yeah, you are tired.
[33:58.01]You're tired.
[33:58.71]I don't want to bring you.
[34:13.03]Oh, I hate you so much.
[34:18.86]Burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it, burn it.
[34:21.52]I'm turning the page with his face.
[34:26.04]I need food.
[34:38.11]I would like to buy...
[34:40.58]I got lots of money.
[34:41.24]Let's get some... Let's get, like, ten potatoes.
[34:43.78]Because I always use them.
[34:48.89]Let's get, like, five bananas.
[34:52.17]Maybe a couple of squids.
[34:57.94]Beef is too expensive.
[35:00.12]Um, squid.
[35:01.22]I'll get, like, three squids.
[35:03.48]For Roberto.
[35:07.58]And...
[35:11.39]I feel like I have so much stuff to sell, but I don't know what the hell it does.
[35:19.84]Like, Yu-Gi-Oh cards.
[35:22.44]These battle cards.
[35:23.64]What the hell?
[35:24.00]What are these even for?
[35:25.95]Silver coin, amethyst.
[35:29.09]Hey, where's the Monster Rancher expert?
[35:31.59]You still here?
[35:33.59]What are these for?
[35:42.10]Yes, I am.
[35:42.80]Alright, what are these for?
[35:44.06]Should I just sell all this expensive stuff?
[35:48.55]Luxuries?
[35:52.65]It's for fusions later on.
[35:54.41]Okay.
[35:55.35]So don't use them.
[35:57.36]Ooh.
[35:57.62]Alright, don't use these either.
[36:00.08]I'm not gonna use them.
[36:00.56]I'm gonna hold on.
[36:12.51]I hate Perver so much I'm whimpering right now.
[36:15.47]Don't worry.
[36:19.89]Well, I can walk the plank in like a few days.
[36:27.37]Some of those will relieve stress.
[36:30.18]Okay, the way we raise Roberto from this point on will determine the difference between victory and defeat.
[36:35.36]Roberto is now no longer a baby.
[36:42.52]Rest.
[36:43.22]And then you got a sandbag.
[36:45.26]Let me take an actual look here.
[36:49.90]220 power.
[36:50.46]Accuracy could use a little work, and so could speed.
[36:55.60]Accuracy and speed.
[36:56.70]Although his moves are so accurate anyways.
[36:58.53]Alright, what does it say?
[37:01.21]Your, like, favorite food?
[37:02.19]Alright, his moves...
[37:13.31]Traits, super weapon, record, temper, cool, size, normal, likes, reference, doesn't like to sleep.
[37:25.00]What do you mean likes to be referenced?
[37:36.68]Why would you not like to sleep?
[37:39.19]That's kind of strange.
[37:45.56]You have to rest, though.
[37:48.02]Do you have to rest?
[37:52.70]Maybe he doesn't have to sleep.
[37:54.40]Okay, well.
[37:54.98]Alright, let me, um... What about these other two?
[38:03.78]Let's make sure they're at least doing something.
[38:07.00]Uh, let's do automatic.
[38:08.72]Ah, fuck me.
[38:11.11]I didn't mean to press X.
[38:18.15]Let me go talk to him.
[38:20.27]He likes references.
[38:24.16]I have those.
[38:25.48]Item.
[38:27.12]Reference.
[38:28.24]A book crammed with all kinds of knowledge.
[38:31.36]Here.
[38:35.26]I just have to show it to him and he likes it.
[38:39.32]Is he holding it?
[38:39.90]Uh.
[38:46.57]He doesn't even read it.
[38:47.45]He just looks at it and goes... Yes!
[38:49.89]Oh, he's happy.
[38:54.34]Alright.
[38:58.10]That's my favorite book!
[39:22.98]Did you notice I'm building an underdog story here?
[39:31.79]Let's take... Let's get them... Yeah, let's go.
[39:34.51]Let's still do the caves.
[39:38.65]Try to level up again.
[39:41.77]Bring them up.
[39:53.00]Kill the Shroom.
[39:57.47]No, I want to progress in the cave.
[40:02.27]Because he's almost level 5.
[40:03.57]This will at least get him... Maybe another move or another trade, maybe?
[40:08.59]That'd be good.
[40:15.49]Oh yeah, right.
[40:15.79]I have to turn this down every time I come in here.
[40:19.26]Give Shroom a chance to let him prove himself.
[40:21.18]Nah.
[40:25.46]It's going to end up as a scenario where he accidentally comes... See, Roberto's going to get hurt.
[40:31.53]And Shroom is going to have to come off the bench.
[40:33.03]It's going to be the last person.
[40:35.21]I'm going to be the coach sitting there staring into the audience.
[40:37.81]Being like, is there anybody in here that I can throw?
[40:41.16]Any of you.
[40:42.00]I'm looking for... My star quarterback got hurt.
[40:45.18]And no one's going to raise their hands.
[40:46.22]And I'm going to have to go to the bench.
[40:48.12]And there's going to be the Shroom.
[40:50.34]And I'm going to wince and go...
[40:54.52]Get in there!
[40:55.20]And he's going to be like, oh, okay!
[40:58.24]It's going to be a very, very defining moment of his character.
[41:01.14]He's going to get in.
[41:02.30]He's going to get the ball.
[41:03.76]And it's going to be, here we go, like five seconds left.
[41:06.40]One, two, three, hut!
[41:08.15]And he's going to go back.
[41:08.87]It's going to be in slow motion.
[41:10.97]And here comes somebody on the left.
[41:12.61]Oh, it's a blitz.
[41:13.69]It's an all-out blitz.
[41:15.37]And his sweat's coming down his head.
[41:16.97]He's got to prove that one fucking point away from a win.
[41:20.42]Literally, he rears back to throw and then cuts to the coach.
[41:25.16]Can't believe it.
[41:25.72]Oh, did I make the right decision?
[41:27.70]Somebody comes he didn't see from his right, grabs him by the arm, tackles and rips his arm off.
[41:34.95]And he just looks over and starts screaming at his arm.
[41:37.43]That's now just a socket.
[41:40.53]Countdown goes down to zero.
[41:44.58]You lose the game.
[41:45.94]You didn't go fast enough.
[41:48.00]Roll the credits.
[42:01.57]And as the credits are rolling, he's getting put on a stretcher.
[42:04.73]The coach is seen was betting on the other team.
[42:10.62]It's just like, what the fuck is that?
[42:13.86]Hold on, what's going on over there?
[42:15.58]He's exchanging money with the other coach.
[42:18.92]He put him in.
[42:20.22]Okay, that's weird.
[42:24.03]The credits keep going down.
[42:27.24]After another 30 seconds of credits, there's a school board meeting for the college.
[42:33.39]And they're shutting down the sports program.
[42:37.65]Not enough money came in this year because of that horrible loss for the college.
[42:58.56]That's not how school funding works if you lose a monster football tournament.
[43:03.32]Oh, I almost rolled a five.
[43:29.65]Oh, I got another one of these.
[43:41.12]Do the rules say don't be a psychopath so you can take all the glory yourself?
[43:48.09]Now you're thinking, now you're thinking with portals.
[43:54.21]These monsters are so easy to cut through.
[44:10.35]Alright, five.
[44:10.79]What do we get?
[44:16.32]That's it?
[44:16.64]I don't think you get anything for level five.
[44:30.13]Not even flex tape.
[44:55.03]Please no portal spoilers.
[44:58.87]Uh, I'm sorry.
[44:59.71]I didn't mean to.
[45:05.84]Most of the items you find in this dungeon, you give to your monsters.
[45:08.70]Later on, items need to be appraised, then used in fusions.
[45:12.44]Okay.
[45:20.15]That missed.
[45:21.17]How?
[45:34.30]Did I milk Vroomer before he died?
[45:36.58]No.
[45:38.30]You can't do that in this game.
[45:39.50]I just want to get him to level 5, but it seems like he didn't get anything.
[45:59.49]Why do I keep re- I don't know, guys.
[46:01.47]I wish I could tell you why I read those.
[46:05.09]It just kind of is there.
[46:06.25]As a one-hit kill.
[46:10.75]I just, I look over and I see it and it's just, oh, okay.
[46:16.15]One guy.
[46:25.18]Read the good boy messages for once.
[46:27.04]Alright, I'm no longer going to read those messages that come up about, like, milking people.
[46:36.47]So don't even try.
[47:02.02]Really love your stuff, by the way, have you?
[47:03.76]Yeah.
[47:05.56]Pretty good try.
[47:10.06]Damn, okay.
[47:18.03]97 damage.
[47:27.55]Do you like the TV show The Venture Brothers?
[47:28.99]Yeah?
[47:30.65]It's a good show.
[47:32.81]It was fun, funny.
[47:35.31]Didn't they bring it back for like a special season or something?
[47:38.49]Or is it actually back now forever?
[47:48.06]They're still making episodes.
[47:53.33]It never ended.
[47:54.15]Didn't it go on like a hiatus for six years or something?
[47:57.43]More than that.
[48:02.14]I remember watching that a long time ago.
[48:08.27]Nobody stands a chance.
[48:09.37]152 damage.
[48:10.37]I don't belong here.
[48:21.12]Almost level 6, though.
[48:21.96]Alright, can anybody help me with the...
[48:33.09]Hasn't every Adult Swim show been canceled at some point?
[48:37.99]Yeah.
[48:39.09]Adult Swim is such a weird network.
[48:45.61]Because they just, like, kind of throw spaghetti into the ceiling.
[48:49.76]And then sometimes a piece will stick.
[48:51.56]Alright, what about the other monsters?
[49:00.70]Roberto can't help you, but what about the other ones?
[49:04.43]Can the bunny do something here?
[49:08.78]Energize cannot help you investigate, no.
[49:13.62]What about Prover?
[49:19.06]No.
[49:25.10]But... I think some of my... Probably some of my favorite shows... At least back...
[49:32.60]When I watched TV every day, where I'm on Adult Swim.
[49:45.19]There were some really good shows.
[49:46.29]I have like four of those.
[49:55.95]I hate Prover so much, don't you understand?
[49:58.47]Well, just wait for the football game.
[50:12.29]Please, no.
[50:14.65]That was too dark.
[50:17.85]Get in there!
[50:18.73]Really?
[50:19.13]You're a little bunny rabbit.
[50:20.12]You can't go in a little bunny rabbit hole.
[50:32.76]Wait, we have to see the animation.
[50:34.52]What happened?
[50:35.10]Did you hear that?
[50:47.61]You have the least offensive walk.
[50:49.75]Sound and animation, so.
[51:03.30]Offensive, yeah, like offensive to my ears.
[51:04.94]660 points.
[51:14.08]There are too many bats.
[51:16.12]Yeah, there are.
[51:17.48]Yeah, there are.
[51:22.34]Languages are so weird.
[51:26.89]There are.
[51:27.33]I just said the same word.
[51:30.13]English is so hard to understand.
[51:33.03]Oh, they're over there.
[51:33.63]Oh, there, there.
[51:35.13]What'd you say?
[51:51.82]Let's see what the bunny can do.
[51:54.52]One damage?
[51:55.06]Wait, the damage... Wait, what's this?
[51:56.28]Is this a scream?
[51:58.61]This is a scream.
[52:01.69]This is Bunny PogChamp.
[52:03.27]There, you guys want to be able to Pog?
[52:05.21]There it is.
[52:05.65]Uh-oh.
[52:08.13]I can't even pull.
[52:15.16]Back up and do it.
[52:20.19]I didn't even do anything.
[52:21.26]Alright, I can't move back to have me... Back it up.
[52:24.50]Here we go.
[52:25.88]It's called Moo-haha.
[52:26.36]Moo-haha!
[52:27.78]What?
[52:47.37]You don't have any other moves.
[52:48.47]These moves are all pieces.
[52:50.09]How much damage?
[52:54.95]Weak.
[52:59.21]What about, uh, let's bring in the plant.
[53:03.16]Prover.
[53:04.60]Alright, you got, it's called Pecking.
[53:07.24]And you also have Pollen.
[53:13.04]Pretty sick move.
[53:14.92]Pretty SICK move!
[53:24.63]Sorry, I just, like, screamed at you.
[53:30.19]Golden foot.
[53:31.99]Sniper.
[53:32.47]Probably better for the pollen attack, right?
[53:42.10]Well, he does have high intelligence, so that's... that helps.
[53:44.30]Another sword.
[53:50.74]What are the bunny's traits?
[53:51.92]Oh, that's a good idea.
[53:55.46]Let's see.
[53:57.36]Bunny's traits are... Power of moves that use defeat and reduces damage, but it's harder to dodge.
[54:05.20]And the traits for Pruva are Magic Lore.
[54:12.12]Ups magic power and lets you add a magic to skill.
[54:17.32]I still don't know what that means.
[54:20.10]And then Sniper and Pheromone.
[54:21.62]Creates power of moves that use charm.
[54:23.10]Okay, so I can charm enemies?
[54:34.66]What do you guys think is the hardest English sentence to remotely understand for someone that does not speak it?
[54:44.17]It's gotta be something with the words that sound exactly the same but mean different things.
[55:03.03]Follow Jerma985 on Twitch is the hardest thing to understand.
[55:09.19]Buffalo?
[55:12.38]What do you mean, Buffalo?
[55:16.78]That's the hardest word to understand?
[55:26.27]He doesn't know.
[55:26.97]No, I don't.
[55:42.14]I don't know what that means!
[55:46.99]Well, don't let him die.
[55:50.33]Pull him out, quick!
[55:51.29]Pull him out, pull him out.
[55:52.47]I can't even do anything.
[55:54.11]Pull him out!
[55:56.07]Bring in Roberto.
[55:56.71]We can end this shit.
[56:01.00]I don't want anybody dying.
[56:06.22]Wikipedia.
[56:07.02]Buffalo.
[56:07.54]What?
[56:08.20]There's a Wikipedia article for the word Buffalo?
[56:10.05]It's like eight times?
[56:13.73]It's a grammatically correct sentence in American English, often presented as an example of how homonyms and homophones can be used to create complicated linguistic constructs through lexical ambiguity.
[56:25.53]It has been discussed in literature in various forms, and it appeared in Beyond Language Adventures in Word and Thought.
[56:33.04]The sentence employs three distinct meanings of the word buffalo.
[56:38.02]as a proper noun to refer to a specific place named Buffalo, the city of Buffalo, New York, as a verb, meaning to bully, harass, or intimidate, as a noun to refer to the animal,
[56:51.96]More easily decoded, though semantically equivalent, would be bison from buffalo.
[56:56.95]That other bison from buffalo bully themselves, bully bison from buffalo.
[57:02.33]Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo.
[57:06.29]Buffalo from buffalo.
[57:07.83]But that's not...
[57:13.77]Buffalo, Buffalo, the animal called Buffalo from the city of Buffalo.
[57:16.27]That Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo, that animal from the city bully.
[57:18.61]Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo, are bullying these animals from that city.
[57:20.97]Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo from the Buffalo.
[57:23.22]Alright, I'm done.
[57:25.24]I... I don't... I don't... I'm done.
[57:26.40]I don't want to read that anymore.
[57:31.14]But that's not a sentence.
[57:37.67]Turn slash.
[57:38.59]Nice.
[57:40.51]But, I mean, it is a sentence, but... Those are just words.
[57:46.19]You just, it's just... Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo.
[57:50.43]It's a noun, verb, and an adjective.
[57:53.78]That's so stupid!
[58:04.33]Buffalo, Buffalo, Buffalo.
[58:06.77]Buffalo, Buffalo.
[58:15.78]Yeah, but you don't say Buffalo from Buffalo.
[58:31.73]That's right, you say Buffalo Buffalo.
[58:38.59]How late am I?
[58:39.98]How late am I to the party here?
[58:46.56]Any word is weird when you say it.
[58:52.25]Let's say, pick a word.
[58:53.29]Okay, I'm going to use the word mosquito, okay?
[58:59.65]When you say a word that many times, or you think about a word that many times, it becomes so strange.
[59:05.02]Mosquito.
[59:07.26]Mosquito, mosquito, mosquito.
[59:11.36]Mosquito?
[59:12.80]That doesn't sound right now.
[59:19.70]The speed is too much here, just instant kill, please.
[59:33.17]This is like probably... There's like 2,700 people here.
[59:35.95]I bet you anything.
[59:39.33]2,000 of you want me to stop this conversation.
[59:42.85]And 400 of you just said the same word like 10 times and went, what the fuck?
[60:07.85]Was another one?
[60:10.83]James, well, John had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had, had.
[60:17.14]But nobody talks like that.
[60:20.50]Nobody actually speaks the way that that is written.
[60:25.42]Semantic satiation, period.
[60:29.84]Yeah, but that's not like a real sentence.
[60:31.78]You wouldn't have a conversation like that with somebody.
[60:41.02]If somebody was talking like that on the subway, you'd move two seats to the right.
[60:47.55]You'd be like, ah, this person's fucking kind of going crazy.
[60:57.39]You'd be like, move down a few seats.
[61:16.01]It's 100% grammatically perfect, and that's the point.
[61:32.10]You're missing the point.
[61:32.92]Don't hurt yourself trying to think about it.
[61:34.38]No, I get it.
[61:34.98]I know it's like a complete grammatical sentence.
[61:37.84]What I'm talking about... If somebody was learning English, you wouldn't... A difficult sentence for them to understand would not be... Right?
[61:51.46]I'm talking about like a sentence that you would see in like everyday life.
[62:01.39]That's not a goalpost move, that's like, that's not, nobody has that conversation.
[62:05.22]There we go.
[62:20.76]Alright, give me the level 6.
[62:31.45]Nah, get outta here.
[62:32.66]No, Final Guts.
[62:33.54]Final Guts is dumb.
[62:50.97]This topic fucking sucks.
[62:56.87]It's not really a topic as much as it's a question.
[63:01.53]not a point stop I don't want to read this but can be understood through I'm not reading it
[63:31.17]I'm not gonna read it!
[63:32.19]No!
[63:32.47]I've already read two of them.
[63:42.12]Buffalo Had Had Had Had Buffalo Had Shad.
[63:47.46]What?
[63:53.25]What is this?
[63:58.59]That's it!
[63:58.97]I beat it.
[64:06.94]So I got a new move for, uh, I was almost gonna say Chad.
[64:14.15]Let's take a look.
[64:14.67]Cool.
[64:18.19]There it is.
[64:22.51]What's it called?
[64:23.94]Turn slash.
[64:25.26]Life damage A. Cut in two is also A. This takes 30 guts, this takes 20, so a little bit more to use it.
[64:37.89]Accuracy C. Accuracy E. It's more accurate.
[64:43.64]Mid-range.
[64:44.40]So it's better than Cutting 2.
[64:50.28]It just takes more to use, but that's fine.
[64:52.48]I'd rather use that, to be honest.
[64:57.40]Does the same amount of damage and hits more often, but just time it better with the guts.
[65:07.56]Didn't he get something else too?
[65:08.40]Somebody else.
[65:08.96]Somebody get something else.
[65:09.86]Alright.
[65:15.67]You like golden sword and honey.
[65:17.49]You don't like honey toast.
[65:21.09]You like sleep and you don't like to fight.
[65:25.87]I told you this is the worst.
[65:28.28]Let's see it.
[65:28.86]I told you an hour from now.
[65:30.54]I want to see the people that are writing.
[65:32.24]Ice him.
[65:33.20]Right?
[65:33.80]Here it is.
[65:40.42]Told you this was gonna happen.
[65:41.40]Okay.
[65:45.40]Let's take a look at the schedule.
[65:48.71]Sandbag.
[65:49.91]I'm gonna change this, because I wanted to do... Accuracy.
[65:55.49]It's pretty low.
[65:57.23]Tub.
[65:57.87]Target, tub.
[66:00.84]You only... You just sleep.
[66:03.04]No, you have such good stats.
[66:06.38]Read the book.
[66:07.52]And then...
[66:13.42]Get in the tub.
[66:16.05]No.
[66:16.53]Likely.
[66:18.41]And then you... Sandbag... And... Target.
[66:28.70]Alright, get to work.
[66:35.70]Roberto, that was really good.
[66:38.36]Prover is... That was awful.
[66:42.79]I like to sleep and I don't like to do any fighting or anything.
[66:50.07]And you guys want me to keep... Look at him.
[66:51.81]He doesn't even care.
[66:57.04]Man, he went to the Buffalo Wikipedia page and he's trying to learn English.
[67:00.14]And now his brain doesn't function anymore.
[67:01.92]Okay.
[67:12.64]What is he like?
[67:14.58]What do mushrooms even eat?
[67:15.68]Potatoes?
[67:16.16]I don't even know.
[67:16.76]What would you even eat?
[67:18.26]What was that?
[67:19.14]What did he just say?
[67:21.47]Did that use an energy?
[67:22.59]Did that use an action?
[67:23.69]What?
[67:24.41]What happened?
[67:26.37]Hey, why don't you eat the thing that looks like you, but isn't you?
[67:31.21]It's a completely different animal.
[67:32.39]What a weird, fucked up world we live in.
[67:36.54]I guess he liked that.
[67:55.87]Little bunnies like carrots.
[67:57.47]What am I, stupid?
[67:59.61]Here, have a squid.
[68:08.39]Does that mean I don't like it?
[68:16.29]What does the third swing from Legend of Zelda noise mean?
[68:21.78]I don't know.
[68:28.27]Alright, let's go.
[68:32.95]Uh, Roberto has to do... What?
[68:34.35]We need more tournaments.
[68:35.55]Roberto... No.
[68:36.79]That's a gamer fact that only a real gamer would know.
[68:47.06]I know.
[68:48.92]I'm a real gamer.
[68:53.58]So, Roberto has tournament next week.
[68:58.40]So, let's do... Yeah, rest up for that tournament.
[69:03.22]In fact, let's switch this around.
[69:05.04]Rest now.
[69:06.99]And do tub.
[69:07.77]Today, the tournament.
[69:10.91]So, you're nice and fresh.
[69:12.29]I'm going to do target.
[69:15.19]You're going to do life blade.
[69:18.65]Go for it.
[69:24.10]Not bad for success.
[69:28.94]That's another plus 6 for Prover.
[69:33.04]But this does look pretty funny though.
[69:39.57]This is so... Look at this bad gym form.
[69:44.49]I swear to God, I've seen people at the gym do this when I used to work out all the time.
[69:49.09]It's like, dude, what the fuck even exercise are you trying to do?
[69:52.06]You get some old, like, 60-year-old man come over and do this exact thing.
[69:58.08]This doesn't do anything.
[69:59.06]What are you working out?
[70:06.01]You know, just my back, my eyes, chest, and legs.
[70:10.65]Have you ever read anything about how to correctly do an exercise?
[70:13.91]No, I just pick up things and move them.
[70:17.05]Do you want me to show you how to do something?
[70:18.77]No, no, I can do it.
[70:22.37]And then that person would not show up two, three straight weeks in a row, and you'd see them again, and it turns out that they hurt themselves.
[70:28.76]Yeah, I don't know what happened.
[70:30.38]I tweaked my neck somehow when I was working out.
[70:33.22]Maybe I'm just getting old.
[70:50.60]Jerma's the jock that no one likes?
[70:52.46]What are you talking about?
[70:53.36]Okay, wait, wait.
[70:59.33]That did just come off like really, really, really... Like mean and elitist.
[71:07.76]Sir, you want me to help you out there?
[71:08.96]You want me to show you how to do it?
[71:11.30]I can do it.
[71:11.82]You're gonna get hurt.
[71:13.36]Okay, fine.
[71:13.96]See you later.
[71:15.00]And I got the two ear pods in blasting music.
[71:18.46]How do people even talk like that?
[71:21.32]I have an actual question for those of you watching.
[71:24.66]When there are ear pods in your ears and I can hear every single word and it's so loud and you're having a direct, perfect conversation with me, how is it possible?
[71:39.76]How do you talk?
[71:47.36]When I do that, I'm going to show you guys what happens, okay?
[71:51.34]We're going to do a real experiment on stream.
[71:53.97]I'm going to blast a... I'm going to give you a gym song.
[71:57.77]Ready?
[71:59.77]What is it called?
[72:00.71]Hold on.
[72:00.95]Give me the gym song.
[72:01.69]The gym song that everybody in the gym listens to.
[72:03.63]I know what it is.
[72:04.31]God damn it.
[72:05.75]Okay.
[72:10.24]Oh, come on.
[72:11.46]It's on the tip of my tongue.
[72:14.64]No, no, no, no.
[72:15.28]It's not like one of those jokey meme ones.
[72:16.90]It's like... It's a Fallout Boy song.
[72:20.41]What is it called?
[72:36.17]Hold on.
[72:36.53]Where is it?
[72:36.93]Where is it?
[72:37.21]Where is it?
[72:43.73]Fall Out Boy's famous single.
[72:47.02]I don't know the name of the song.
[72:53.22]What is their most famous song?
[72:54.90]I don't know what it is, but I know what it sounds like.
[73:10.93]What is it called?
[73:12.05]Not the brown note.
[73:13.65]I wanna do an experiment.
[73:17.53]Is this it?
[73:20.37]Centuries?
[73:21.67]Hold on.
[73:21.93]I'm only gonna play this for like two seconds.
[73:25.15]Don't worry.
[73:26.06]Forget about the VOD.
[73:36.06]This is it!
[73:36.88]This is it!
[73:40.07]This is the one that you hear.
[73:41.19]Okay, so here's the experiment.
[73:42.47]You ready?
[73:48.23]So, I'm going to try to talk to you guys.
[73:50.29]I'm going to be the guy at the gym that talks to you.
[73:52.51]This is going to be as loud as I can make this, and we'll see how hard it is to speak.
[73:57.72]Here we go.
[74:00.68]The thing is, you have to be able to hear this.
[74:03.40]You will.
[74:03.84]You will.
[74:04.24]I'm at the gym.
[74:04.84]You'll hear it.
[74:17.50]Hey, bro.
[74:18.68]What's going on, man?
[74:20.18]You need some help with the, uh, with the bench?
[74:25.11]Yeah, let me get over there and... What are you doing?

[74:32.15]You're a strong guy.
[74:34.61]Yeah.
[74:36.41]Yeah, I read that book, too.
[74:37.63]That's a good book.
[74:45.29]I can't do it for more than five seconds.
[74:54.84]You see what I'm talking about?
[74:59.74]How do you talk like this?
[75:02.00]This is a dating sim.
[75:17.57]I can't fucking do it anymore.

[76:15.37]No, you can't hear that.
[76:16.69]It needs to be louder.
[76:21.57]This hurts my head.
[76:22.41]10 hours of the brown noise.
[76:32.71]Why is it not playing?
[76:37.94]That just... That just fucking caused me anguish.

[77:11.21]Let me try this.
[77:40.15]I can't, this is an acting, okay.
[77:42.73]This is, this is an acting class.
[77:45.95]You wanna learn how to act and you wanna learn how to compose yourself during a scene?
[77:49.01]They should do this in workshops.
[77:50.39]I should run a workshop and do this.
[77:55.59]You're an actor.
[77:57.65]The scene is you're a jock in the gym trying to talk to somebody doing whiffs and waits, alright?
[78:11.23]It's desynced?
[78:11.85]It shouldn't be.
[78:14.75]No, it's not.
[78:17.82]Desync!
[78:21.62]It should be synced up fine.
[78:28.70]Is it?
[78:29.02]It shouldn't be desynced.
[78:29.76]This is on 650.
[78:30.21]This should be on 650 too.
[78:32.27]Yeah, it's on 650.
[78:45.30]No?
[78:46.80]I think you guys need to refresh.
[78:47.86]Okay, here we go.
[78:57.21]The video is behind.
[78:58.51]I got an idea.
[79:11.76]There you go.
[79:13.49]Alright, here we go.
[79:14.82]Acting class.
[79:16.48]The guy at the gym comes up to you.
[79:21.81]He's got earphones in, he's talking.
[79:36.50]That's fucking impossible.
[79:38.70]It's so loud, you don't understand.
[79:40.23]It sounds, you can hear it kind of, but to me, that is the loudest fucking sound I've ever heard in my entire life.
[79:56.58]Why would somebody be listening to this at the gym?
[79:59.60]This is what's in your earphones.
[80:13.39]I can't do this.
[80:20.69]Can you?
[80:29.42]He's a bad actor, I'm not a bad actor.
[80:34.64]Can we hear it?
[80:35.54]You can't hear this?
[80:48.35]It's so fucking loud.
[80:49.96]Here we go.
[81:02.42]Hey, man.
[81:02.68]You, uh... Put that down.
[81:13.27]Hey, man.
[81:13.61]You, uh... I noticed...
[81:20.24]I will do this until the fucking stream ends.
[81:21.86]I don't care.
[81:24.34]It's not the fact that it's fucking somebody shitting their pants.
[81:27.41]It's so loud that it scares you.
[81:30.05]Hey, bro.
[81:39.61]I noticed that you were having trouble with weights.
[81:42.74]I'm sorry.
[81:53.35]I fucking hate this, but I have to do it.
[81:56.44]Boogers are going to come flying out of my nose.
[81:57.89]God damn it.
[82:15.51]Hey, bro, I, uh, I was just, uh, noticing that you had some, uh, you were doing 220 on the, on the bench.
[82:20.58]Nah, man, I'll take care of that.
[82:22.06]You need, uh, you need a spotter.
[82:23.16]You're here alone.
[82:24.02]You need a spotter to help you here.
[82:25.14]I think... That counted.
[82:40.26]That, that counts.
[82:41.15]That has to count.
[83:02.45]Hey, man.
[83:09.36]Hey, man.
[83:09.74]I'm just, uh... I was... I was noticing that you were on the bench here, and you were doing, like, 220.
[83:14.76]You don't have a spotter?
[83:16.46]It's weird.
[83:17.10]Usually you come with a spotter to the gym, bro.
[83:19.90]Yeah, I can help you do that.
[83:21.35]I can get on there with you.
[83:24.57]We can do it together at the same time, actually.
[83:26.31]That's how I spot.
[83:27.17]Usually I just move to the left and the person on the bench also is... We do it together at the same time.
[83:51.83]I don't even know if you guys could hear that, but I tried.
[83:58.04]Try another scene!
[83:59.18]That's the scene!
[84:15.54]Somebody's screaming!
[84:24.76]Imagine, I just, the reason why this is funny to me is I imagine somebody in the gym with a playlist with this shit on their playlist.
[84:33.59]Why would you have this on a playlist?
[84:36.63]This is something that you listen to?
[84:39.25]You are fucked.
[84:40.67]You are fucked up screaming and like people farting.
[84:45.79]Why would this person have this?
[84:48.77]And you're not even embarrassed, you don't even care.
[84:58.73]I tell people to watch you for good content and this is what you do to me?
[85:21.32]Both at the same time in different tabs.
[85:25.13]Oh, you're killing, you're gonna kill me.
[85:27.87]I won't be able to do it.
[85:30.42]Guys, that's not going to happen.
[85:38.68]Alright, I'm going to try this one time.
[85:40.62]I'm going to do this one fucking final time.
[85:51.55]Hey, what are you listening to, man?
[85:53.21]Oh, you know, I got Fall Out Boy on here.
[85:55.42]Oh, scream and fart compilation at the same time.
[86:11.02]How loud are these?
[86:15.64]That's pretty fucking loud.
[86:59.88]No, no, no!
[87:01.14]I'm fucking crying!
[87:07.40]God damn it!
[87:29.74]It keeps going over, over and over again.
[87:31.49]The guy with the fucking tank top, and he's jacked, and he's got like fucking oil all over him.
[87:36.15]He's got this like super spray tan.
[87:38.11]And he's just like throwing weights around at you, like he walks by you.
[87:43.65]And you're just like kind of doing whatever, and he's doing his thing, and he's really loud.
[87:46.95]And that's what you hear really fucking loud.
[87:49.31]You're just like, what's fucking wrong with that guy?
[87:55.26]Jesus.
[87:59.10]Nice Monster Rancher scream.
[88:05.72]Why am I... I was laughing too hard, too fast.
[88:17.19]I don't even know what prompted this.
[88:24.49]That's fucking insane.
[88:27.25]What happened to this stream?
[88:32.82]Can we even go back to Monster Rancher?
[88:38.45]Finish the skit.
[89:08.37]It's the fact that, and it was like the Wilhelm scream, the like, it's from every weird video game at the same time.
[89:23.97]This is harder than Sekiro, it is.
[89:25.55]It's not even the fact that it's like funny because it's like, oh, somebody farting.
[89:28.38]Ugh.
[89:31.94]Harder than Sekiro, this is the hardest thing.
[89:33.16]This is like the hard thing challenge.
[89:41.79]No, that's it.
[89:42.45]I can't go back.
[89:48.26]I can't go back.
[89:52.76]I look like the bully from the Disney original channel movie.
[89:58.69]I was about to turn to the acting again and be like, hey, shut up, bro.
[90:04.63]You always have the tongue like that.
[90:06.49]You want to be like a Disney Channel bully?
[90:08.39]I'll give you the quick acting tips.
[90:10.25]This is an acting stream now.
[90:12.07]Say a sentence and then slowly smile and bite down on the edges of your tongue.
[90:18.94]And then walk.
[90:20.02]Every time.
[90:20.56]If you want to be like a character that's like an asshole.
[90:23.80]Yeah, I mean, you lifted those weights pretty shittily for a weakling, you know what I mean?
[90:31.31]Bite.
[90:32.63]Like that.
[90:34.33]What happened to my string?
[90:40.12]I didn't, why did that happen?
[90:43.32]What?
[90:45.88]That wasn't supposed to happen.
[90:49.98]No, I'm going back to playing Monster Rancher.
[90:52.30]I don't remember what we were doing.
[91:05.63]it's time to play the game I don't know how long I've been doing this for but it's been way too long oh my god this is this is the scream thing let me see

[91:53.05]You can take a clip of this.
[91:55.59]Like, right here.
[92:06.51]Why is this so sad?
[92:14.39]Just watch this.
[92:15.69]Why is this so sad to this person?
[92:19.16]What like weird fucked up place is this?
[92:22.10]I'm like, no, no, I don't want this Look at this
[92:33.75]Forget about this part here, because this is where I start to lose it, but look at this.
[92:36.45]Right here.
[92:44.08]No, no, no.
[92:50.64]I'm fucking crying.
[92:51.88]God damn it.
[92:55.94]No, no.
[92:56.44]No, please, I don't.
[93:10.05]You've been sitting there for three hours with your eyes full.
[93:13.68]I'm going to take a break.
[93:14.46]I'll be right back.
[93:15.16]This is the worst thing.
[95:31.51]I just got up and moved around and like got, like I went pee.
[95:37.43]Kim is in the bathroom and I'm just peeing.
[95:40.09]She hears piss going into the toilet, right?
[95:43.15]You know what that sounds like.
[95:44.09]And then it would stop, cause I was laughing.
[95:46.05]So like I could, it was like, she's closing me up.
[95:49.49]Bang, piss comes up real fast.
[95:51.03]Like after I can get a breath and stop, just like get over it, right?
[95:55.58]She goes, wow, that's a vicious pee.
[96:01.72]I have to start laughing again.
[96:02.90]I'm broken.
[96:17.19]I have to sit here and relax.
[96:19.14]I really do.
[96:31.20]Why was Kim listening?
[96:32.00]Because she was like, the way that the bathroom is set up is there's the bathroom and then there's a door to the toilet.
[96:41.06]So it's like this tiny little airplane bathroom that's inside of a bathroom.
[96:47.78]It's kind of weird.
[96:49.12]There's a door to the toilet, but then there's an actual like bathroom with like a sink and shit.
[96:55.42]There's like a stall in the bathroom.
[96:56.70]I have one of those.
[96:57.18]See, somebody knows what I'm talking about.
[97:03.33]Um, how did we get there?
[97:06.39]Because the mushroom was doing a weird workout, and I made fun of the workout, and then I got into how people blast music in their ears, and it's hard to talk, and then people at the gym do that, and it's, like, funny, and then it, I don't know, it got somehow from there.
[97:26.22]But, um, we are going to try to just get composed here, and continue to play this game.
[97:38.47]I am mentally drained, but I just get a break for a minute.
[97:50.20]I don't even know how long that went on for.
[97:56.82]But here is Monster Rancher 4.
[98:00.34]Here it is.
[98:05.12]Let's go ahead and continue what we were doing.
[98:11.60]What's the link?
[98:15.80]Yeah, this is like, okay, new format.
[98:20.96]Oh, my special boy is graduating college.
[98:25.05]Oh, what a beautiful, what a beautiful, beautiful day it is for my boy.
[98:37.08]That's like your dad, that's like dad is happy with text next to it and maybe an image that comes after it or before it.
[98:46.95]Dad is so happy he's crying.
[98:51.15]Do what you will.
[98:56.52]That's a wedding dad right there.
[98:58.82]That is a first dance wedding dad.
[99:08.97]hair, too.
[99:10.01]Somehow, like, my hair got all fucked up in the back.
[99:15.58]Alright, what were we doing?
[99:16.82]My boy.
[99:19.96]There's another one, there's another one, there's another one.
[99:25.78]This is a good one.
[99:26.80]I'll cap this one for you.
[99:29.53]Alright, now that's my boy.
[99:31.73]What about this one?
[99:34.27]You could use this in a lot of different formats, couldn't you?
[99:36.21]I don't know why I'm giving you guys so much fire here.
[99:39.39]But hold on, look at this.
[99:41.61]This is important.
[99:42.29]Oh, fuck my hand, I'm sorry.
[99:50.41]This is fucking embarrassing.
[99:52.82]But I don't care, whatever.
[99:55.06]There's so many fucked up, dumb images of me on the internet.
[99:58.14]Like, whatever.
[100:00.52]I'll give you this one myself.
[100:12.27]Okay, this is called... That was Happy Sad.
[100:16.07]No, this is Sad Dad.
[100:19.29]You actually could be used.
[100:20.41]I'll put it on the screen.
[100:25.09]We'll break down the differences here.
[100:35.19]So hold on, let's see.
[100:39.86]Oh, not my boy!
[100:45.59]Wait, so let's get this one.
[100:48.39]Where's the other one?
[100:58.96]Why can't I click this?
[100:59.78]Alright, so here we go.
[101:06.12]This one's gonna be called My Boy.
[101:07.56]Let's put these next to each other so you can see what I'm talking about.
[101:24.11]One of these is, you know, my boy, I'm so happy.
[101:28.23]And the other one is, oh no, I don't know about this.
[101:30.65]I mean, they both could be.
[101:43.94]Crimson chin.
[101:47.22]What?
[101:48.56]What do you mean?
[101:52.65]Oh, you mean there.
[101:53.49]You mean like, okay.
[101:58.19]Look at, look.
[102:06.45]New emotes.
[102:09.38]Yeah.
[102:12.46]Look at this though.
[102:14.38]Get in real close here.
[102:17.82]Like, this is real.
[102:21.16]Look at right here.
[102:27.66]That's actual real emotion in those eyes.
[102:34.86]There's pain, there's happiness, there's suffering.
[102:51.45]Raw emotion.
[102:58.29]There's more of these.
[102:59.53]No, I gotta move on.
[103:00.85]We can't just... What?
[103:07.48]This is not even a picture.
[103:10.84]Dude, I don't understand.
[103:13.36]You just took... Why?
[103:24.76]Come on, this is not even a... You doctored this image.
[103:47.57]Alright, is that like, is that what I think I look like when I look in the mirror?
[103:50.88]You know what I mean?
[103:52.18]I'm looking at a mirror in a dream.
[103:53.40]Remember I told you don't look in a mirror when you're in a dream?
[103:57.00]This is what you'll see.
[103:58.84]You'll see like a goofy claymation version of yourself if you look at a mirror while you're dreaming.
[104:11.80]You look like a bird.
[104:15.97]Which one looks worse though?
[104:18.00]Let's be honest.
[104:28.31]Where is it?
[104:34.59]I actually think that the other one might look better.
[104:42.37]You deliberately fucked with this.
[104:45.82]And I think the picture on the left is uglier than the one on the right.
[104:56.86]I mean the one on the right is like more handsome.
[105:15.97]This is ridiculous.
[105:17.03]Okay, I'm done.
[105:18.85]You look like an orc.
[105:25.19]When is the self-conscious hour gonna be over?
[105:27.39]I'm just kidding.
[105:27.97]Alright, I have to move on.
[105:36.69]We have to go.
[105:37.97]No more, no more.
[105:39.79]We've spent our time.
[105:45.65]We've had our fun.
[105:47.89]I need to train monsters in this game.
[105:51.61]I'm going to X out of the window that says screaming compilation.
[105:59.13]That'd be good.
[106:00.01]The one with my hands.
[106:00.95]Look at how long my fingernails are.
[106:06.75]Alright, let's go.
[106:22.19]Alright, that's the last one, I promise.
[106:34.25]I'll keep this one for a little while.
[106:47.01]How did you take an image of me crying and do this?
[106:54.95]Look at the hair, though.
[107:02.59]Alright.
[107:16.35]Let's go.
[107:20.91]Uncanny Valley.
[107:23.43]Yeah, that's like somebody inputting me into a program and computer-generating me.
[107:30.55]If anybody still gives a shit about Jerma985 in a hundred years, they'll have a computer that will do that, but that's gonna be in the corner.
[107:46.05]Alright, I have to change this now.
[107:48.45]Because this is not going to be synced up anymore.
[107:50.93]There we go.
[107:54.58]I'm going to pick Two-Face.
[108:00.86]Did anyone have a competition today?
[108:03.34]I don't think they did.
[108:04.02]Did they?
[108:05.17]No.
[108:06.87]Tomorrow there is one.
[108:08.13]Roberto is in it.
[108:10.05]Let's go.
[108:25.57]No.
[108:28.34]No!
[108:28.86]No.
[108:29.08]You just made me into like a Dark Souls NPC.
[109:01.45]It looks like I look a hundred years old This is like expectation versus reality, right?
[109:35.86]This is my current, my current, we'll do current mood.
[109:52.37]Current mood.
[109:54.63]Alright, there's enough of this.
[109:56.93]No more.
[109:58.65]No more of these.
[109:59.71]This is not even my face.
[110:01.29]This is a different person's face.
[110:06.64]Whose face is this?
[110:14.66]Okay.
[110:15.04]I don't- that's not my face.
[110:36.27]ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com, right?
[110:46.94]This looks like my brother.
[111:13.54]Okay, alright, I'm done.
[112:03.29]This is like evolution!
[112:10.79]Like, do I evolve into this thing?
[112:23.61]Summon the Forbidden One.
[112:28.31]No, I'm not putting that one on.
[112:30.41]This is, alright, hold on, we start here.
[112:35.37]I don't know!
[112:36.13]Is this, like, this is like, okay, this one here's the start.
[112:38.89]This is where I, like, devolve.
[112:41.23]Into, like, the computer-generated person.
[112:43.93]And then I turn into this.
[112:52.08]You guys are so quick with this shit, it's fucking hilarious.
[113:09.15]Okay, this is too much fun.
[113:13.38]That is real.
[113:15.96]This is what's really going to happen.
[113:19.16]I want you to remember this.
[113:29.14]I will look like this exactly.
[113:31.82]It's gonna be completely the same.
[114:08.40]Fuck wrong thing This doesn't work like this
[114:38.74]I got it hold on Almost
[115:23.81]There is the evolution.
[115:35.03]There's the evolution of my boy!
[115:52.95]Yeah, so, alright, you got... This is what, like, dad... Okay, I got it.
[115:55.79]This is what dad looked like when he was in college.
[116:00.50]And then dad, you know, met your mother.
[116:02.26]And then they had children.
[116:06.52]And this is, like, about my boys are growing up.
[116:09.02]There they are.
[116:10.80]My boys and girls are both growing up.
[116:12.74]Getting older.
[116:15.20]Riding the bike for the first time.
[116:19.51]Changing diapers.
[116:21.75]Move on to here.
[116:24.33]He proposed.
[116:25.47]He proposed to her.
[116:27.67]My back hurts.
[116:28.77]I can't really mow the lawn anymore.
[116:33.93]I might actually get, I'm gonna get to see my grandson and my granddaughter get married.
[116:38.66]I can't believe it.
[116:40.54]Here's the day of the wedding.
[116:43.44]They got married.
[116:44.14]They actually did.
[116:45.72]And all the work I've put in over the decades of time.
[116:51.82]Finally gonna see my son and my daughter
[117:03.26]No, no, no.
[117:04.14]Like, you have two kids and they both marry different people, guys.
[117:08.97]No.
[117:34.91]These have to be flipped because this is like young.
[117:40.85]This is like 16 year old.
[117:43.51]This is like dad in college.
[117:44.99]This is dad when he's a teenager.
[117:54.04]I think we fixed it.
[118:15.84]Okay.
[118:17.30]Schedule.
[118:25.53]Un-fucking-believable.
[118:30.19]So, we need to rest... Roberto has a tournament today.
[118:35.85]Rest, rest.
[118:36.73]Good.
[118:37.07]Everyone's gonna feed everybody.
[118:42.95]That's good, plus almost 9 defense from Roberto.
[118:47.32]It's funny because the title of this stream is Splicing DNA on the Ranch.
[118:51.54]And that's kind of what we were just doing with me.
[119:00.81]So we got a tournament today?
[119:02.49]Cool, okay.
[119:03.41]Tournament today.
[119:30.89]Okay.
[119:32.81]Sorry, I had to take a second.
[119:35.07]So today's the day for Roberto.
[119:36.41]Uh, I gotta feed Roberto.
[119:42.64]Food!
[119:44.26]Uh, squid.
[119:45.28]You like squid, don't ya?
[119:48.08]I gotta move this, I kinda fucked this whole thing up somehow.
[119:55.52]You can't continue like nothing happened.
[119:59.04]Look, that was the intermission.
[120:00.78]The stream goes on.
[120:03.68]That was like the episode two of stream.
[120:07.71]Monster Rancher stream two.
[120:08.89]Let's feed the rabbit.
[120:12.57]Potato.
[120:19.65]That was an exhausting intermission, yeah?
[120:22.93]There's all of it.
[120:25.62]How many of these do you have?
[120:26.42]jermaThick?
[120:27.85]That's not part of the family.
[120:36.97]What if I just filled out every one of my last emote slots with those?
[120:41.26]What dogshit.
[120:43.50]What a terrible channel this would be.
[120:46.18]Imagine if like half of my emotes were just all those images.
[120:56.19]Alright, Roberto.
[120:57.73]Let's stomp it.
[121:05.00]You mean the planets?
[121:05.86]But the planets at least have like a transparency background.
[121:10.26]It's not just clips of my foam in the background.
[121:14.50]Oh, that was something else.
[121:24.35]Alright, Roberto versus Fiddler.
[121:29.87]Let's take a look at the enemy here.
[121:30.87]Is it gonna be a one-hit kill, or a two-hit kill?
[121:35.06]Ugh.
[121:44.76]My stomach fucking hurts.
[121:50.39]Yeah, that's audio foam.
[121:51.73]Yeah.
[121:53.87]That's the new move, turn slash.
[121:55.31]It's really good.
[122:04.45]He's so good.
[122:06.08]He is really so good.
[122:24.09]He's got BBS colors, of course he's good!
[122:26.35]No, we're gonna just win instantly.
[122:37.61]Could he beat Sweet Rhyme?
[122:38.99]Definitely, I think so.
[122:43.67]Chi!
[122:45.87]Ready, one, two, three!
[122:48.91]He's too good.
[122:51.82]That move is so good, it is a one-hit kill on 90% of everybody.
[122:58.18]We gotta get him up quick before he dies.
[123:01.40]I gotta just do tournaments with Roberto, get him to rank B and A.
[123:10.13]This thing is terrible.
[123:11.59]Just kill it.
[123:23.05]Whoa.
[123:26.03]How do you get one of these?
[123:26.93]How do you get one of the big dogs?
[123:28.21]I would love one of these big dogs.
[123:45.12]Risk of Rain 2 is out.
[123:47.10]Yeah, I think actually, I think me and Etalyx are gonna play that in a couple days.
[123:53.51]Looks fun.
[123:59.89]It is an A rank unlock.
[124:05.51]Okay, cool.
[124:06.06]1500 gold, 8 more fame.
[124:07.68]Roberto getting popular.
[124:10.58]It's very good.
[124:11.84]Cool.

[125:38.14]Let's get you intelligence training.
[125:40.46]Are you tired now?
[125:41.48]You're good.
[125:45.29]And let's get you some... Yeah, accuracy training.
[125:51.33]And then you, sandbag training, and then rest.
[125:54.11]And then lifeblade twice.
[125:55.51]Sounds good.
[125:57.09]And then I'm also going to make sure you sign up for the next possible tournament.
[126:01.17]Which is... Where is it?
[126:07.15]Oh my god.
[126:08.39]This one right here, Roberto.
[126:09.65]Get it.
[126:10.97]And then the official tournament is the next two days afterwards.
[126:14.19]Ugh.
[126:27.24]I can't, like, play when shit like this is in the chat.
[126:31.96]You know how difficult it is for me to, like, focus on this video game when this is in the chat over and over again?
[126:47.85]What image is this, and why is it still in the background?
[126:53.67]No, it's gone.
[126:57.73]Alright, he signed up for it.
[127:02.64]His training is gonna be... Yeah.
[127:05.28]So he's going today.
[127:07.24]All of them are doing something.
[127:09.68]Not bad, everybody's pretty good.
[127:14.76]How are you doing?
[127:16.09]You got a tournament you need to eat.
[127:18.75]Tired.
[127:21.31]Uh, praise.
[127:22.19]You're doing great.
[127:22.91]You're actually doing a great job.
[127:29.61]And I'll feed you, too, because you're hungry.
[127:33.09]Give him a squid.
[127:39.13]Gotta feed the robot?
[127:40.03]Yeah.
[127:40.79]For some reason.
[127:42.61]You're gonna sleep before the tournament.
[127:45.23]And you need to eat, too.
[127:49.53]I'll give you a squid.
[128:01.46]Lively.
[128:03.58]And you are tired, though, so... To bed!
[128:10.23]Is this better than Monster Rancher 2?
[128:12.57]Uh... That's hard to say.
[128:17.79]So he's gonna rest today.
[128:19.85]They both... I like Monster Rancher 2's... ...minigame system better.
[128:28.85]Because this is kind of just numbers...
[128:31.80]On the screen.
[128:32.40]Whereas you got to actually see the fun little animation play out and... And although they were repetitive, it was still fun to see them.
[128:39.53]Alright, we can buy something maybe here.
[128:41.79]What will you do?
[128:43.67]Buy... Can I buy a bigger house?
[128:48.93]Lifeblade, tub... Trampoline, target, book, sandbag... What am I missing?
[128:54.76]Trampoline, target... No, I have it all.
[128:58.44]How do I buy a bigger house?
[129:02.54]Praise anything?
[129:03.33]Customize... Is there a way I can custom- I can buy a bigger house?
[129:11.95]I do have to win more tournaments.
[129:14.41]No, it's another corn emote.
[129:31.35]What am I missing?
[129:32.09]Nothing.
[129:35.73]Another?
[129:36.09]Yeah, there's like 10 or 12 corn emotes flying around.
[129:42.58]Can't really do anything.
[129:45.04]Alright.
[129:55.58]Calendar.
[129:56.10]We've got another tournament here.
[129:59.09]Almost ready to get out of D rank into C rank, hopefully.
[130:03.83]So you can do some... Give me some accuracy training.
[130:12.05]You can do some more...
[130:19.57]We need some more health on you, even though who cares.
[130:22.85]Rest, and then your tournament.
[130:25.37]Sounds good.
[130:26.57]Begin.
[130:26.83]Oh, that's terrible.
[130:37.40]Some people have all their whole channel's emotes corn-related.
[130:43.90]How the hell would you do that?
[130:49.04]I mean, that's almost as dumb as having him be completely planet-related.
[130:57.52]Like, every emote's a planet.
[130:59.84]Just, like, a royalty-free NASA image.
[131:03.91]With, like, your face on it from, like, a picture you took at BlizzCon, like, four and a half years ago.
[131:09.11]You know what I mean?
[131:21.37]Uh, you can eat too.
[131:22.39]I know you don't like bananas, but... Do you?
[131:25.81]Do you like bananas?
[131:27.47]Yeah, you do.
[131:34.59]Alright, let me see.
[131:37.79]Get Roberto in there.
[131:39.45]Steamroll another comp- Yeah, steamroll another competition.
[131:42.08]And then we can finally climb out of this dumb rink.
[131:49.97]Jeremy says he won't read gross messages but spends an hour crying at a fart joke.
[131:54.45]It wasn't the fact that it was a fart.
[131:56.13]It was the fact that it was loud and it was the whole scenario.
[132:00.05]It wasn't just the fart that I thought was funny.
[132:03.07]It was the entire bowl of soup.
[132:05.31]It wasn't just the carrots.
[132:07.63]It was the lentils.
[132:08.71]It was the kale.
[132:10.69]It was the broth.
[132:12.43]The whole bowl of soup was hilarious to me.
[132:15.00]FreudianWeapon, thanks for the ten bucks.
[132:18.81]No, 10 bucks.
[132:19.29]10 community subs, not 10 bucks.
[132:21.03]That's way more than $10.
[132:24.48]Freudian coming in.
[132:25.62]10 community subs.
[132:28.18]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[132:33.45]Thank you, Freudian.
[132:35.39]10 community subs.
[132:36.87]Rolling in.
[132:43.93]Did I just describe farts like a bowl of soup?
[132:46.27]No, I described the whole scenario as many ingredients into why I thought that was that funny.
[132:52.37]Jerma is a mature streamer.
[132:53.79]Oh, I'm not gonna... It's alright.
[132:56.33]By the way, this is a fluffy dog vroomer.
[133:01.57]That's actually pretty cool.
[133:08.84]Turn slash.
[133:09.38]And just wink.
[133:10.76]Bingo.
[133:13.57]Roberto!
[133:20.76]Maybe I should just build up.
[133:23.50]I think I'm just gonna ult, okay, for Roberto now.
[133:27.46]I'm just gonna build Accuracy and Power.
[133:30.88]And just try to be the complete glass cannon where you just have really high chance to hit.
[133:37.15]And just try to kill things in one or two hits.
[133:39.37]Preferably one hit.
[133:45.27]Yeah, I got this.
[133:46.80]Opponent quit.
[133:50.86]Afraid of Roberto.
[133:54.94]Holiday versus... They're all the same monster.
[133:57.18]Yeah, I got this in the bag.
[134:07.79]I still have this corn on my monitor.
[134:09.21]Get this out of here.
[134:12.48]Every time I close a window, there's another fucked up image that I have to see.
[134:15.08]I have, like, ten tabs open.
[134:22.54]Do it again.
[134:27.24]That's it.
[134:27.68]One- Oh, almost one hit.
[134:28.90]It's okay.
[134:30.38]One has a higher hit percent chance.
[134:32.12]Slash does.
[134:41.64]Well, I missed the kick.
[134:42.88]Uh-oh.
[134:45.10]That's not good.
[134:50.36]No, that's not good at all.
[134:51.63]Back it up.
[134:56.29]Getting close now.
[134:57.37]Closer, closer, closer, closer, closer.
[135:10.89]There we go.
[135:11.45]Alright.
[135:12.33]That's why I gotta build up accuracy and power.
[135:14.79]I'm gonna run into a scenario where I'm just gonna burn through guts and lose.
[135:23.88]What'd I get for money?
[135:27.28]Yeah, the dashing is what did it, but I just didn't want to get in range.
[135:33.46]I got a peach.
[135:34.32]Cool.
[135:35.80]Roberto getting pretty popular.
[135:37.19]Almost 50. 50.
[135:51.37]So then let's take a look at the calendar.
[135:53.21]You've got official tournament here.
[135:54.77]For Roberto, let's get him in tip-top shape.
[135:58.89]We have two cycles to work with today.
[136:01.11]Let me see.
[136:04.28]Let's take a look.
[136:08.94]228 power.
[136:09.30]I gotta get that accuracy up.
[136:10.96]Jeremia lied about Minecraft VR.
[136:12.26]Thanks for five community subs.
[136:14.24]More community subs rolling in.
[136:17.04]Thank you, guys.
[136:17.47]More.
[136:18.95]More.
[136:20.71]community sub drops.
[136:24.23]You guys are very generous, thank you.
[136:28.73]Accuracy and speed are probably what I need to do.
[136:33.86]Accuracy, speed, and power.
[136:44.62]So let's take this, get life out of here.
[136:46.06]Accuracy.
[136:50.87]Speed.
[136:51.41]Let's do accuracy twice.
[136:53.37]And then we'll rest before the tournament.
[136:57.61]He's tired.
[136:58.25]He's tired.
[136:58.85]We'll do... We'll rest now.
[137:02.91]And then we'll do two days of accuracy training.
[137:10.07]That should be good.
[137:10.77]What about you guys?
[137:13.79]You... Let's get you into...
[137:18.81]Let me just even look up... you guys are just useless, so who cares.
[137:22.23]Let's see... Your life and your intelligence are great.
[137:29.09]Power ac- you're not gonna be... doing bad.
[137:33.11]Accuracy and defense are probably important.
[137:35.20]Let's just do accuracy and intelligence then.
[137:38.22]Or, let's just give intelligence like over 200.
[137:39.80]Or defense.
[137:41.96]I'm gonna say defense.
[137:50.12]Defense.
[137:52.10]Book is fine.
[137:52.82]And then what about you?
[137:55.93]Kind of balanced all the way around except your health is terrible.
[138:04.86]I'm gonna say health and speed.
[138:07.16]Or health and accuracy.
[138:08.14]Let's just do health a couple times.
[138:13.17]What does intelligence improve?
[138:14.37]It improves magic damage.
[138:16.85]Any move that is a green move, not a yellow move.
[138:20.07]Yellow is based on power, green is based on intelligence.
[138:23.51]So it makes you do more damage with your green-based, intelligence-based moves.
[138:30.32]And I believe it also increases your defense to those moves as well.
[138:33.72]At least I think that's what it was like in the second game.
[138:38.12]Yeah, it's like magic resist.
[138:39.10]Because defense does not help with magic damage, I don't think.
[138:45.31]Alright, I think that's good.
[138:47.43]You just need... What was it?
[138:51.17]Health, right?
[138:54.32]Health.
[138:55.68]And health.
[138:56.48]Your health is terrible.
[138:58.14]Alright.
[139:00.20]Goodnight!
[139:02.94]Not raising by very much.
[139:12.32]Tired, you can rest tomorrow.
[139:14.34]Frustrated?
[139:14.96]Oh no, wait.
[139:18.12]Whatever.
[139:20.12]How you doing?
[139:20.83]Lively!
[139:21.43]Good, have a potato.
[139:31.77]What flavor mushroom is that?
[139:34.50]Uh, lemon-lime.
[139:37.28]That's a sprite-flavored mushroom.
[139:41.59]Oh, sorry.
[139:42.29]Surge-flavored mushroom.
[139:45.27]It's probably more accurate.
[139:55.26]So the tournament's tomorrow.
[139:58.74]Right here.
[140:00.22]So I got a couple of days.
[140:05.72]You killed Wall-E?
[140:06.66]No, I had to.
[140:07.40]I had to do it.
[140:16.87]Alright, you're frustrated, so you don't have to do anything today.
[140:24.18]Rest and then book.
[140:26.16]You are tired, so rest and then lifeblade.
[140:28.82]And you are gonna do target training, and then maybe target training again.
[140:47.51]Go for it.
[140:53.04]That was really good.
[140:55.38]Plus 12 into Accuracy.
[140:57.40]And we're doing it tomorrow as well.
[141:01.48]Good work!
[141:01.88]Anybody else need anything?
[141:13.43]I think everyone's just sleeping.
[141:19.84]Yeah, you're good.
[141:21.92]Next day.
[141:22.80]Next week.
[141:26.08]Competition is... One more day.
[141:29.90]Nobody can join this one, so okay, not even... Why even do it?
[141:32.91]This will hopefully get us to C. I really hope so.
[141:39.89]Because that'll be the first time we've been able to do it.
[141:44.55]I'm getting carried by Roberto.
[141:45.99]Oh yeah, absolutely.
[141:49.48]So you can probably do this training and be fine.
[141:53.40]Yeah.
[141:54.28]And I'll just feed you.
[141:55.56]You'll be fine.
[141:57.64]You're lively.
[142:07.30]Okay, not bad.
[142:10.80]Please don't be tired.
[142:13.42]Nice, okay.
[142:14.40]Good.
[142:15.54]Have some good food.
[142:16.44]We're gonna give you a... Uh-oh.
[142:19.53]I wonder if I should give him an energy bar.
[142:24.41]Oh, this is too expensive.
[142:26.23]Maybe I'll just give it to him.
[142:28.16]So I can guarantee myself.
[142:32.48]Yeah, I'm gonna give it to him.
[142:35.68]Take this.
[142:37.50]And get us into Rank C!
[142:48.21]He's good.
[142:52.07]Roberto's gonna get addicted to energy bars.
[143:00.59]Fuse him before he dies.
[143:01.73]His genes are too good to lose.
[143:03.35]I will make sure.
[143:05.81]Alright, we got a bullshit ending on the last time we did this.
[143:15.13]By Calabrino last standing like three times.
[143:21.45]My stats are really, really good.
[143:23.07]I have amazing moves.
[143:25.83]This is just high intelligence.
[143:28.69]Watch out for the INT attacks.
[143:36.84]I gave myself some more accuracy.
[143:38.16]This should help a lot.
[143:46.70]He's already started enough.
[143:48.63]Good block.
[143:53.46]Get in there.
[143:54.87]Get in there, don't let him do anything.
[143:57.69]It's alright.
[143:59.19]Alright, now I'm going to stick with just the regular slash.
[144:02.29]Yeah, it does so much damage.
[144:03.53]Might as well just do it twice.
[144:09.60]If you can start it off with that turn slash move, the jumping one, then you're good to go.
[144:14.36]But if you don't get it first, I'm not going to do it again because it takes 30 guts.
[144:17.16]Not a good idea.
[144:25.80]Roberto currently is probably gonna live to three and a half years old energy bars boosts and Remove some of the remaining time alive Yeah, that's good to know so energy bars actually take years off of their life State Pretty much balanced across the board except no power and no defense really
[144:55.23]stay away from the intelligence moves, from what it seems.
[145:08.17]Bingo.
[145:08.99]Goodbye.
[145:15.01]Stay in close.
[145:19.84]See you guys at rank C, because that's definitely where we're going to be at the end of this.
[145:26.37]And then I'll see you at rank B. Not long after.
[145:29.83]Probably intelligence.
[145:36.01]Most... I have not seen, so far since playing, very many high power enemies.
[145:44.03]Everyone's building intelligence for some reason.
[145:51.98]Very few high power enemies.
[146:03.92]It's alright.
[146:04.50]Get it again.
[146:05.22]That's alright.
[146:07.77]Mmm, not good.
[146:10.17]Good.
[146:11.41]Final Guts.
[146:12.03]Alright, that's annoying.
[146:15.61]That's also annoying.
[146:22.34]Not good.
[146:27.02]Thank god.
[146:30.45]Final Guts is the worst.
[146:32.85]Is there a way that... I wonder if there's a move you can get.
[146:37.04]Where you just turn off their Final Guts.
[146:39.44]I wonder if there's a Stay Dead move.
[146:56.61]Okay.
[146:57.59]It always ends in Calerino.
[147:00.23]So I just have to beat everybody here.
[147:02.33]Alright, here we go.
[147:04.15]High power, high life.
[147:07.21]Decent speed.
[147:08.01]This is going to be hard.
[147:09.05]Okay, I'm not going to do... I'm only going to do slash here because it's the highest accuracy that I have.
[147:16.93]He'll dodge everything.
[147:17.67]Just getting close.
[147:28.49]That's not a good start.
[147:29.85]That's a really bad start.
[147:32.83]Just don't even give him a chance.
[147:34.75]Again.
[147:36.13]78% chance to hit this.
[147:38.65]Got him.
[147:49.31]Only one more... two more fights.
[148:05.31]Roberto versus Kellerino.
[148:06.93]Round two.
[148:08.09]Have you improved at all?
[148:10.71]High intelligence, low power, high health.
[148:13.87]So just... Watch out for the intelligence moves.
[148:19.83]And try to just burn down.
[148:24.71]I'm only going to go for slashes here.
[148:26.01]I already saw that dialog.
[148:31.21]I already read it in a funny voice, didn't I?
[148:32.93]Alright.
[148:38.38]Monitor guts, get in close, and slash.
[148:44.86]Good block.
[148:47.36]84% chance to hit this.
[148:50.05]Oh, perfect.
[148:51.15]Do it again.
[148:53.65]83%.
[148:54.25]Goodbye.
[148:57.49]That was, we didn't get, that was such bullshit.
[149:00.71]Last time I did this was two final guts.
[149:05.63]Going up to rank suit.
[149:16.21]Roberto really is just extraordinarily powerful.
[149:20.43]That's why I want to try to just grind to rank A, so we can unlock some more monsters.
[149:26.08]How could I lose to this kid?
[149:28.16]This is just unbelievable.
[149:31.44]Two grand and a squid.
[149:49.18]Roberto!
[149:50.91]You've done it.
[149:51.97]You've brought us into a new realm.
[149:57.39]Congratulations, Fane.
[149:58.49]I had no idea you'd come so far.
[150:00.57]I mean, no.
[150:01.93]Sorry.
[150:02.43]What?
[150:03.55]It's alright.
[150:04.81]Oh no, that was me talking.
[150:06.83]It's alright, Caesar.
[150:07.43]I can't even believe it myself.
[150:09.79]I mean, shoot, after I was kicked out of Elvis' school, I thought that I'd lost my last chance.
[150:15.87]There are always chances.
[150:16.84]People just overlook them.
[150:19.03]Rio, you've really made a wonderful ranch.
[150:21.99]Fain, you look after this ranch in Rio, too.
[150:24.96]Yes, sir.
[150:25.44]Leave it to me.
[150:26.68]Cheers!
[150:28.76]Oh, you really did it.
[150:30.76]You're all I thought you'd be.
[150:33.22]Now you've got to set your sights higher.
[150:34.59]Next stop.
[150:36.15]The competition in Ruin.
[150:37.95]The Femba Hotspot.
[150:40.15]The Kingdom Capital.
[150:41.31]Roiwin.
[150:42.47]Yeah, we can do it.
[150:45.86]I needed to know why I had this power and who I was.
[150:49.96]Here at the ranch, I've been gradually putting the pieces together.
[150:54.35]I won't deny my identity anymore.
[150:55.87]I'm not afraid of the truth.
[150:58.45]Hey, Rio!
[151:00.41]I'll find my own path as the true Rio.
[151:05.13]The true... What do you mean, the true Rio?
[151:14.38]Good job.
[151:14.96]You deserve rest.
[151:19.63]Rest.
[151:21.37]And then let's work on that accuracy some more, what do you say?
[151:28.96]Maybe I'll take him into a... Can I go anywhere new?
[151:30.62]Now that I'm rank C. Can I take him to a different... So here we got this.
[151:38.49]Nothing at all.
[151:39.17]Until here, which obviously you're going to sign up for it.
[151:45.17]It's a long time.
[151:52.43]Yeah, can I do something else?
[151:55.77]Because that was the cave.
[151:57.53]Maybe I unlocked a new place.
[151:59.93]We'll find out.
[152:02.41]Anyways.
[152:03.59]Resting.
[152:04.39]Book.
[152:06.39]Sandbag.
[152:07.89]And everyone's hungry.
[152:08.71]I need to go to town.
[152:09.44]Can't go to town right this second.
[152:20.09]Go to town.
[152:20.51]Yeah, and I saw that.
[152:21.49]Go to town when you can.
[152:22.09]You can upgrade the house in the new intel.
[152:23.51]Yeah, I saw it.
[152:25.41]I saw it.
[152:26.07]I saw it.
[152:27.43]I saw it.
[152:28.83]I saw it.
[152:32.09]People are hungry.
[152:32.65]I have a potato.
[152:42.48]I don't want potato.
[152:47.68]Well, sure if I have a banana then.
[152:58.03]Frustrated.
[153:00.35]Lively.
[153:01.97]Okay, here, you can have a banana too.
[153:09.23]Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo.
[153:12.53]There you go, Energize.
[153:15.13]Frustrated.
[153:19.85]Hey man, I see you deadlifting.
[153:21.28]What is that, 250 without a spotter?
[153:34.83]Only the caves.
[153:35.59]Alright, I need to buy food.
[153:38.61]Or, you said go to town.
[153:47.29]Shrine.
[153:47.71]Association.
[153:48.41]Item.
[153:48.69]Association.
[153:49.23]Is there anything new?
[153:49.71]Can I do anything?
[153:51.77]What can I do for you today?
[153:53.72]No.
[153:56.96]Shrine?
[154:00.86]So what will it be?
[154:02.62]Appraise.
[154:04.20]No, just a moment.
[154:04.84]You don't have a saucer stone.
[154:08.38]Whatever.
[154:08.86]Whatever, you old fuck.
[154:22.10]What?
[154:25.84]What?
[154:30.11]What?
[154:30.35]That wasn't that bad.
[154:36.69]Oh, Fane, look at that.
[154:39.23]Visitors from the ocean.
[154:41.54]What, from the ocean?
[154:42.40]What do you mean, Rio?
[154:43.42]Oh.
[154:48.96]I'm just coming up.
[154:54.43]That looks like a monster on its own.
[154:56.33]Like a giant turtle.
[155:03.60]Aha!
[155:05.00]So this is that ranch I've been hearing about.
[155:06.64]Ahoy!
[155:07.70]Uh, who are you?
[155:10.97]Ah yes, the name's Gunwale.
[155:12.57]I'm a proud man of the sea.
[155:14.23]Ahoy!
[155:14.67]Uh, what do you need?
[155:19.34]Excuse me, Paul told me about the young band of travelers heading across the sea to the capital.
[155:25.73]I noticed that you were doing 200 pounds without a spotter.
[155:29.41]I'm thinking about coming in here, helping you out.
[155:31.93]Be careful, and maybe if you scoot over.
[155:34.67]But such marvelous young people can't do without a boat.
[155:38.89]So I rushed over here to offer you my trusted sardine, you see.
[155:42.37]Ahoy!
[155:44.29]You mean this boat?
[155:45.17]We couldn't.
[155:46.67]No, no, no, don't be silly.
[155:48.15]Accept.
[155:49.84]My old partner, the sardine, will once again sail the seas with the youthful hopes of riding upon it.
[155:57.44]It's just marvelous.
[155:59.95]Don't you think?
[156:00.43]Ahoy!
[156:03.23]Uh, yeah, I guess you're right.
[156:06.17]Well then, it's settled.
[156:07.65]You take good care of my little sardine.
[156:09.79]Now head south, young folks.
[156:11.39]Ahoy!
[156:15.33]He's gone.
[156:16.11]What was up with that fellow?
[156:18.25]It was really strange.
[156:20.71]I don't know how he was able to talk to us so clearly with all the screaming and farts in his ears.
[156:26.77]He gave us a nice boat.
[156:27.63]Why would this guy just give us a boat?
[156:34.06]What a stupid guy.
[156:35.92]Didn't even ask for like money.
[156:37.10]Alright.
[156:40.00]I'm going to assume that means I can... I can probably go somewhere else now.
[156:48.17]We'll try that.
[156:49.01]But first, wait a minute.
[156:52.56]Feed your guild members in stream legends.
[156:56.04]Why is Nightbot saying that?
[156:59.06]Is Nightbot playing stream legends?
[157:07.05]What the hell?
[157:09.73]Anyways, so let's just keep building.
[157:11.99]Let me see what I actually want to do with you.
[157:13.87]Let's get a good training regimen.
[157:16.13]Accuracy and speed.
[157:19.11]with some power sprinkled in, in between.
[157:21.72]So we're going to go speed, speed, accuracy, speed, power.
[157:27.30]Speed.
[157:28.56]All I have is the high jump.
[157:36.97]I think I'm going to... Fuck.
[157:39.79]Fuck.
[157:50.98]Um... Maybe I'll just stick with power and accuracy then.
[157:58.98]Accuracy.
[158:01.08]Accuracy, power.
[158:02.90]Power, accuracy, power, rest.
[158:07.04]Accuracy.
[158:07.56]No.
[158:07.94]Accuracy.
[158:09.72]Accuracy, power.
[158:11.82]No, rest.
[158:14.99]Power.
[158:18.48]So we got Power, Accuracy, Power, Rest.
[158:20.96]Accuracy, Accuracy, Rest, Power.
[158:26.60]Fuckin' sick.
[158:28.60]Who cares?
[158:30.30]Just do Automatic with these idiots.
[158:36.93]Speed.
[158:39.41]And then we're gonna Auto do... Technique.
[158:50.52]Go for it!
[158:54.34]I think it's a little higher than that.
[158:57.50]I don't have to do it again, though.
[159:21.47]Have a squid.
[159:31.21]Let's take him to the new, uh, zone.
[159:33.59]Frustrated.
[159:35.35]You'll be fine.
[159:37.55]Have a banana.
[159:38.40]No, have a potato.
[159:53.72]Getting, like, stream legends exploits in the chat.
[160:00.49]Look, just be happy, okay?
[160:08.23]Feed us.
[160:08.83]I will.
[160:09.17]I did that at the end of the stream.
[160:22.14]Honda!
[160:22.90]Honda!
[160:23.64]Toyota!
[160:24.04]Toyota!
[160:24.44]Toyota!
[160:25.86]Honda!
[160:26.22]Toyota!
[160:26.60]Honda!
[160:28.16]Up!
[160:28.46]Down!
[160:29.00]Toyota!
[160:29.83]Toyota!
[160:30.21]Toyota!
[160:30.59]Toyota!
[160:31.71]Now I wish I could play that game for real.
[160:36.87]Lively.
[160:37.17]Everyone's good.
[160:39.25]Let's see if we can do something new here for the adventure.
[160:42.11]Adventure.
[160:42.91]Toggle caves.
[160:43.87]What?
[160:47.59]I have a boat now.
[160:48.33]Why can't I do anything?
[160:56.95]Left, right, left, right, Toyota, Toyota, Toyota Honda Okay We got everyone scheduled Look at the calendar Let's take a look at the calendar That's a long ways away Good gain in accuracy, good
[161:28.37]You're just doing fine, good.
[161:29.75]Okay.
[161:31.03]Lively, lively, sleepy, sleepy.
[161:41.90]Just keep the training up.
[161:50.90]Pretty good gains all around.
[161:57.50]Whoa.
[161:59.79]Hello?
[162:01.19]We good?
[162:04.57]Oh, the whole thing just fucking died there for a second.
[162:09.34]We're good.
[162:10.80]The internet, like, just exploded for a second, but I think we're okay.
[162:13.16]Uh-oh.
[162:18.81]Uh... It hasn't turned off.
[162:22.75]It's probably going through a rough patch like it does sometimes.
[162:28.09]Tired.
[162:28.43]You need to rest.
[162:37.31]Well, I have more references.
[162:38.27]Here, look at this.
[162:38.77]Don't you like this?
[162:47.60]And, uh, I'm gonna feed you, too.
[162:50.84]Have a potato.
[162:56.02]Roberto wants pork.
[163:00.66]Pork?
[163:03.87]Where do I get pork from?
[163:07.09]Pork is not beef.
[163:16.20]I want pork.
[163:20.42]Can I go get it?
[163:20.96]Ooh, wait a minute.
[163:23.63]New town.
[163:25.45]City of academia and culture known for its coliseum, library, and monster studies.
[163:30.55]Well, let's go here.
[163:37.57]Yeah, I know, but where do you get it in the game?
[163:49.82]Look at that, Fane!
[163:50.80]It says Ruin Rookie Club!
[163:53.20]Wow, a new competition!
[163:54.34]Well, let's go have a look!
[163:58.14]Oh, shut up!
[163:58.40]Uh...
[164:07.72]There's like a million people in this crowd.
[164:11.18]Huh?
[164:11.34]Is that you thing?
[164:13.32]Graham?
[164:14.00]Why are you here?
[164:14.66]Nice to see you.
[164:17.42]What the heck are you doing here?
[164:19.28]I can't believe you.
[164:20.22]Quitting school all of a sudden and all that.
[164:23.46]Now here's something you won't believe.
[164:25.11]I became a breeder here in ruin.
[164:28.45]What is he doing with his finger?
[164:31.19]I kind of screwed up this competition and that's why I'm here.
[164:35.34]Wow, you became a Ruin Breeder right after graduating Elvish School?
[164:42.14]You dummy.
[164:42.84]There's only one real ace who graduated from Elvish School, and it's her.
[164:48.24]Look up on the stage and take a good look at the champion breeder.
[164:53.08]What?
[164:54.02]Filia?
[164:54.56]Yep, from our same class.
[164:59.47]She's the top-ranked Fimbur rookie.
[165:01.83]And she's cute too.
[165:03.25]She's earned instant popularity.
[165:05.87]She's really incredible.
[165:08.47]Wow, everybody's working so hard.
[165:11.37]I can't wait to battle with everybody.
[165:13.69]Oh, I'll go to the association and ask if I can enter the competition.
[165:26.89]Welcome to FIMBA.
[165:27.89]I'm the receptionist, Pierre.
[165:30.37]Hello, Pierre.
[165:31.15]We're here too.
[165:34.53]First, your appointment name, please.
[165:37.35]What?
[165:38.79]We just came from Toggle.
[165:39.87]We don't have an appointment.
[165:42.20]Well, that's no good.
[165:43.30]I'm sorry.
[165:43.92]We can't see you today.
[165:47.24]What?
[165:48.96]First, fill out in this form, and this form, and this.
[165:54.60]Don't forget to dot your I's and cross your T's.
[165:58.53]Come visit us again next week.
[166:01.74]I don't know why I added A's.
[166:06.34]No way!
[166:06.80]We just came to see if we could enter the rune competition!
[166:10.16]Now listen here, this is the Femba headquarters.
[166:12.80]We can't have people coming in without appointments.
[166:16.98]Now you come again next week and we'll answer any little question that you have.
[166:21.14]But for now, well, the exit is over there.
[166:24.98]It's nothing like the Toggle Monster Association.
[166:29.02]Shoot, we'll just have to come back next week.
[166:41.27]Softlocked.
[166:42.23]Softlocked.
[166:43.23]Softlocked.
[166:44.21]Softlocked.
[166:45.13]Softlocked.
[167:07.65]I was gonna do it right before coming here, but I got distracted.
[167:14.09]Oh no, I was gonna do it right before coming here, but I got distracted by the other town, and now the game soft-locked itself.
[167:21.54]Thank fucking god, get me back quick.
[167:25.70]Oh my goodness, that would have been such a horrendous end to this stream.
[167:29.12]Because, what, am I gonna go back and do three hours worth of Monster Rancher?
[167:32.20]Again?
[167:34.00]Get me back there quick.
[167:41.56]That was- I didn't save one time this whole entire stream.
[167:47.01]Look at that.
[167:49.31]That's- Walnut is still in here, guys.
[167:51.61]That was before... I even... froze Walnut and Vroomer.
[167:57.86]Holy shit, that would've been so bad.
[168:12.99]That was the- it's- it's entire stream.
[168:15.13]Almost three hours.
[168:19.84]Alright.
[168:21.07]Let's see how I fare in C rank.
[168:22.81]We got a couple more, three or four more weeks.
[168:26.29]What are you doing?
[168:26.77]You're resting today?
[168:27.53]Yes, you're very tired.
[168:28.37]You deserve it.
[168:29.01]Target training twice, and then we do sandbag training after a rest.
[168:33.37]Sounds good.
[168:37.95]Pretty good recovery.
[168:41.38]Why did I freeze rumor?
[168:42.34]Because we got to the realization that Roberto...
[168:45.93]was the only one that was going to take us through to a higher rank.
[168:49.01]So then we made these two assholes that were just kind of funny characters to be side content comic relief characters for the main character who is this one.
[169:02.64]And so far I think it's worked out pretty well.
[169:09.79]You almost gave me a heart attack with that softlock.
[169:11.75]I almost had a heart attack in the chair here playing the game when it almost softlocked.
[169:16.95]That would be a hardlock at that point.
[169:21.19]Uh, weekend deck.
[169:21.77]Anybody need to eat?
[169:26.10]Frustrated.
[169:26.64]Um... Here.
[169:31.26]Just be happy.
[169:35.89]What would you have done if it had actually crashed?
[169:37.95]I'm going to be real with you guys.
[169:40.39]I am having a lot of fun playing this.
[169:43.08]And this is like, you know, the second stream we've done of this game.
[169:45.02]And I'm having a good time.
[169:46.64]But that would be so devastating to me.
[169:50.00]That I would probably just put in Mr. Mosquito.
[169:54.83]And maybe I would do off stream.
[169:56.15]I would just grind up and do it again.
[169:57.37]You need to eat.
[170:12.32]Okay.
[170:15.12]Um, you should probably eat too.
[170:17.38]You don't want potatoes though.
[170:20.77]Here, have a peach.
[170:21.47]This is like shaped like you.
[170:23.77]You'll probably like it.
[170:29.27]He loved it.
[170:37.43]What about adventure?
[170:38.19]Still toggle caves.
[170:40.23]Alright, let me, um... Let me go back to town and actually inquire about tournaments and stuff.
[170:51.16]Maybe that's why there's not an official tournament.
[170:54.82]Let's see.
[170:55.34]So it appears that you attended Elvis' school but later dropped out.
[170:59.67]Meaning that you don't have an official breeder license.
[171:03.97]Then you can't enter the competition.
[171:06.87]What, but I entered the toggle competition just fine.
[171:10.08]According to your toggle registration, you entered with a recommendation.
[171:13.56]Hmm.
[171:15.28]Well, for local competition, recommendations from a respected member of the community is acceptable.
[171:20.77]But we can't have just anybody entering the top-level competition.
[171:24.29]Hmm.
[171:27.37]But Thane is the toggle champion.
[171:30.11]Then it shouldn't be a problem for him to get a real license.
[171:33.68]Now, if you would kindly shuffle over to the exit,
[171:38.81]Alright, we need a license.
[171:39.73]Shoot, we came all this way for nothing.
[171:41.73]What's with that?
[171:43.89]I can't believe this.
[171:45.61]I go out on the road for a bit, and that little brat-philia goes and turns into a star.
[171:51.26]What a cruel world.
[171:54.14]Titi?
[171:56.04]And she's in a very bad mood.
[171:59.20]Huh?
[171:59.48]It's you, the ones from Toggle.
[172:01.16]This is too much.
[172:01.88]I'm going home this instant.
[172:04.64]Move it or lose it, Grandma!
[172:05.95]Ah!
[172:12.27]She hit her head on the fucking ground!
[172:14.19]Are you alright?
[172:14.69]She hit her head on the ground!
[172:18.93]What's gotten into her?
[172:21.39]Oh, oh!
[172:22.95]Oh no, she's hurt her bad.
[172:25.34]We better see her home.
[172:33.12]Took you a long time to fall down, but you okay?
[172:37.38]You sure are sweet.
[172:39.71]I forgot to introduce myself.
[172:42.17]I'm Morioh.
[172:44.21]It's a me.
[172:44.93]I don't deserve such kind help from strangers.
[172:48.77]Thank you so much for playing my game.
[172:52.09]Don't mention it.
[172:53.03]Are you going to be okay?
[172:55.87]Oh, of course.
[172:57.09]I'll... You just stay still.
[173:00.45]Do you have any medicine?
[173:02.95]Oh, please.
[173:03.39]Don't worry about me.
[173:04.64]I'll just be fine.
[173:06.40]My daughter's coming home soon and...
[173:09.94]I'm... Oh, that would have been embarrassing.
[173:13.26]Good thing I didn't do it.
[173:14.52]I'm homey!
[173:16.76]I did it anyways.
[173:18.08]Well, speak of the devil.
[173:20.38]Oh, visitors?
[173:23.34]Huh?
[173:24.18]Fane?
[173:26.88]Ilya!
[173:30.50]That's how it happened.
[173:31.96]They brought me home.
[173:35.31]What a coincidence that this is that Fane that you're always telling me about.
[173:40.56]Grandma, don't embarrass me.
[173:42.96]But boy, oh boy, it's been a long time, huh, Fane?
[173:45.58]Ever since that one fateful day.
[173:48.44]Yeah, now I work on a ranch in Toggle, but I'm not an official breeder yet.
[173:54.26]On a ranch?
[173:56.36]That's great.
[173:57.16]I was really worried that you would give up on becoming a breeder altogether.
[174:01.56]Well, for a while there, I almost did.
[174:03.68]But I'm okay now.
[174:04.86]Thanks for crying.
[174:07.42]Um, Philia, can I ask you something?
[174:10.77]It's about your grandmother.
[174:12.31]She's doing a lot worse than I expected.
[174:14.13]She's... What?
[174:16.21]Yeah, Grandma's been very weak lately.
[174:17.95]Normal medicine hardly helps her anymore.
[174:21.32]If only I had some healing mushrooms to make medicine from, but they are rare in these parts.
[174:27.76]Healing mushrooms.
[174:29.58]I think I saw some of those in the cave in Toggle.
[174:33.94]Really?
[174:34.42]Oh, then I can go search for them.
[174:36.75]Really?
[174:37.23]Gee, thanks!
[174:38.49]Sorry.
[174:43.33]Okay, so we gotta get healing mushrooms from the cave.

[182:14.98]I want you guys to be able to hear this, though.
[182:17.65]I mean, this is like the beginning of every single movie you go to.
[182:20.99]This is the sound you hear.
[182:27.80]Usually plays like some upbeat music.
[182:29.46]Please turn your phone off.
[182:47.76]Enjoy the movie!

[183:45.95]This is interesting.
[183:46.45]This is an orange vanilla coke.
[183:49.55]It's strange.
[183:50.07]Yeah, it's alright.
[183:56.99]It's not bad.
[184:00.34]You know what this kind of tastes like?
[184:01.44]It tastes like, uh... What do they call it?
[184:06.16]Like the graveyard sludge when you go and you hold the button down across the whole entire fountain.
[184:12.03]You go to like orange soda, sprite, coke, cherry coke.
[184:17.39]What's that called?
[184:17.89]That's what this tastes like.
[184:25.72]Swamp water.
[184:26.38]There you go.

[185:04.87]Nice, level 9 accuracy.
[185:07.01]That's what I'm fucking talking about.
[185:15.77]You're okay.
[185:17.29]You're frustrated.
[185:18.79]You're both frustrated.
[185:20.83]Look at the focus on you.
[185:21.83]That's bad.
[185:25.15]You're gonna settle down.
[185:26.05]Now you're okay.
[185:35.22]What about you?
[185:36.68]Okay.
[185:37.48]Okay.

[185:49.59]Alright, everyone's alright.
[185:54.73]Proceed to the weekend.
[185:58.04]Which will take us... We have to do the caves, too.
[186:00.74]When is that competition?
[186:01.90]It's soon, isn't it?
[186:10.34]Yeah, so we'll do this, and then we'll go explore the cave, look for the healing mushroom, and bring it to the lady.
[186:18.13]How sick is this lady?
[186:19.39]Because we're not going to be back with this mushroom for like three or four months.
[186:26.31]That's just kind of trying to figure this out.
[186:28.30]Is that... This is going to take us at least six to seven weeks to come back with this.
[186:37.52]Alright.
[186:38.86]Rest.
[186:40.24]Rest.
[186:41.32]Target.

[187:02.76]One that you really like.
[187:03.68]A mango.
[187:14.09]That was a good one.

[188:00.78]You are resting today, and then you're gonna do power training, and then it's first ever attempt at a Rank C tournament.
[188:16.54]Pretty good gains.
[188:23.94]You need to eat.
[188:26.12]Have a... Mango.
[188:31.16]You guys like fruits, right?
[188:32.96]Does everybody like fruits?
[188:34.50]Yeah.
[188:37.47]McDonald's fries cure baldness.
[188:43.03]Am I... Is this a stream that I did like two years ago?
[188:47.75]We already talked about this.
[188:52.25]This was a huge point of contention two years ago when we talked about it.
[188:58.34]It's not true.
[189:07.26]This is the day of... Yes.
[189:10.91]So, he's lively.
[189:11.91]Sandbag training will be fine.
[189:13.25]Give him some more power before we first go into Rank C. I'll give him some food, too.
[189:18.63]Come on.
[189:18.97]Big gains.
[189:19.55]Big gains.
[189:20.09]Nice!

[189:31.73]I gotta get you focused.
[189:32.61]What do you like?
[189:33.17]Let me give you something to, like, get you back on track.
[189:45.98]Likes... the sword.
[189:49.20]I could show you the sword, but I feel like that's... I feel like that's a waste.
[190:03.78]Yeah, the sword guy you think would like the sword, but he likes books instead.
[190:13.92]He's more into books.
[190:21.63]Okay, where's the... Alright, you guys are fine.
[190:26.91]Rank C. First battle.
[190:30.38]This is $3,000 and you get a fish.
[190:32.56]Let's see if I'm gonna get my ass kicked here with Roberto.
[190:42.08]Stupid questions?
[190:42.90]What's MonkaS?
[190:44.68]MonkaS is the... What?
[190:53.88]What the fuck is that?
[190:55.92]Face.
[191:03.22]Uh, Lakrim.
[191:05.66]Let's see how good you guys are.
[191:08.39]Pretty good.
[191:10.57]275 speed, 200 intelligence, 188 attack power.
[191:15.95]Uh... No fucking come on!
[191:21.19]I was trying to say, like, go back!
[191:24.03]He's- now he's just fighting for himself.
[191:27.27]I was trying to go back, like, no, go back!
[191:29.89]But it's give commands, I, uh...
[191:32.95]I wanted to look at my stats in comparison.
[191:34.55]Hopefully.
[191:34.79]Good luck!
[191:36.98]That was the right start.
[191:39.88]Ah.
[191:40.52]Come on.
[191:40.90]One hit!
[191:43.28]You're good.
[191:43.66]You're alright without me.
[191:46.14]Yeah, you're fine without me.
[191:48.40]Do it again.
[191:48.72]Final Guts.
[191:49.14]Who cares?
[191:49.52]It's the most bolster thing in the game.
[191:53.71]Hit him again.
[191:54.07]Hit him.
[191:57.71]Don't let this person do Final Guts and come back and kill you.
[192:01.77]Please do anything and fucking win.
[192:03.35]Please, what are you doing?
[192:17.61]Why even have that as an option?
[192:21.21]Just turn around and then die.
[192:22.87]Did you run out of gas?
[192:25.31]Okay, well... Why?
[192:32.23]Alright, this is Volanz.
[192:35.27]I have to win everything now.
[192:39.91]High intelligence, high accuracy.
[192:51.76]Let's just end it.
[192:55.70]Not gonna lie, Volanz is a pretty cool design.
[193:00.60]That's a dog with a gigantic binocular on his head.
[193:04.34]One single binocular.
[193:06.36]It's like a sniper scope.
[193:10.88]That was a high percentage, too.
[193:15.28]Wow.
[193:15.44]70% chance didn't hit it.
[193:18.46]Holy shit.
[193:21.74]There it is.
[193:22.28]Alright, easy.
[193:23.30]Slow it down.
[193:35.32]It's alright.
[193:37.14]Not that much damage.
[193:40.92]Fuck.
[193:41.40]I went for it.
[193:45.33]I gotta wait for my Guts to build up.
[193:47.03]He's bullish.
[193:50.19]Just hang out, hang out.
[193:51.01]I'm going to gut this kick take.
[193:53.57]Less than slash?
[193:54.21]No.
[193:55.73]More than slash.
[193:58.39]Bingo.
[193:59.71]One more.
[194:01.33]He's out of guts.
[194:03.61]That hurt, but he's out of guts.
[194:06.90]That's not good.
[194:07.52]Got him.
[194:20.17]So, okay, everybody has lost one match.
[194:23.54]That means it's anybody's game.
[194:32.24]Alright, Vinette.
[194:38.75]225 intelligence.
[194:40.29]Actually pretty good across the board.
[194:53.58]Revenge of the Walnut.
[194:55.34]That is just Wall-E.
[194:56.36]It's the same exact kind.
[195:05.33]That's how you... That's what I want to see.
[195:08.23]Right off the bat, almost 200 damage instantly killed.
[195:13.47]That's why we built... so much power.
[195:18.28]Go back to it.
[195:18.86]More power, more accuracy.
[195:21.00]I want to be able to do that every time.
[195:23.67]And you guys were telling me that I shouldn't have Frozen Wallet.
[195:29.43]3,000 gold and a fish.
[195:44.88]Okay.
[195:52.57]Good work.
[195:54.46]calendar we've got another one of these so sign up Roberto and then hopefully let me see here so that's this one then so let's see that's also the same one February March Jesus May where is there an official tournament there is no official tournament you motherfuckers really
[196:25.69]Oh, it's because I have to get the license.
[196:28.43]I gotta get the license.
[196:30.47]Uh, so... How much time is between there and... So we got... Let's take him to the caves and find that healing mushroom.
[196:42.55]Hopefully then we can get a license handed to us.
[196:48.28]And then there'll be an official tournament hopefully soon after these ones here.
[196:52.22]Already signed up for this one?
[196:53.30]Alright, let's go.
[196:56.16]Let's take a look.
[196:56.64]We got sandbag.
[196:57.78]No, rest.
[196:58.46]And then we'll do two sandbags.
[197:00.82]And then rest.
[197:04.56]That's fine.
[197:06.16]That's good.
[197:07.83]You're on automatic anyways.
[197:09.49]Automatic for speed.
[197:11.39]You're on automatic for technique.
[197:27.52]Who's hungry?
[197:34.55]The fish is going to you-know-who.
[197:37.61]I keep trying to give Peruvia a potato, and they never want it.
[197:45.84]You'd think I would have figured that out by now.
[198:00.40]No, not yet.
[198:03.80]Feed us.
[198:05.14]You guys are fine.
[198:18.80]Alright, now you're good.
[198:21.87]Sandbag, sandbag.
[198:29.93]Level 14 power.
[198:31.49]I want him to have over 300 attack power.
[198:38.87]Sleeping.
[198:39.83]You need to eat.
[198:42.01]Yeah, I don't care.
[198:53.09]How is Roberto still alive?
[198:54.44]He's not that old.
[198:58.08]He's not even like a year or two old.
[199:07.07]Now I'll give you a fish.
[199:10.15]You're probably gonna love it.
[199:13.27]Rare in the Seas of Toggle, a nice monster treat.
[199:15.21]Here.
[199:23.68]Feed your guild members.
[199:29.47]How long do they live for?
[199:30.91]Between, I believe between three and five years.
[199:34.03]Depending on how you treat them, how tired they are, how your training goes, right?
[199:41.62]It's between like three and five, three and six years.
[199:48.92]You got another tournament here.
[199:52.60]I have to sandbag, rest, target.
[199:54.26]That sounds good.
[200:01.82]He's killing it right now.
[200:08.26]Did I super glue Wally's mouth shut?
[200:10.74]No.
[200:11.18]I just froze him.
[200:13.52]He needs to rest.
[200:16.22]Come here.
[200:19.66]One more day.
[200:38.39]How are things doing?
[200:39.17]Go ahead, take a look around.
[200:40.89]What will you do?
[200:43.89]Still don't have... I don't have another level up for these.
[200:50.63]Like, sandbag!
[200:51.57]Um... Hanging punching bag, or something.
[200:55.41]Or... Weightlifting!
[200:57.21]There has to be a third or fourth level.
[200:59.12]Why would you stop at level two?
[201:00.24]Maybe I need to find an item or something.
[201:03.90]I gotta find those tablets, right?
[201:14.51]Tort Streamer is stroking his ego.
[201:16.01]He's stroking his ego.
[201:20.81]I don't know what you mean by that.
[201:27.80]Let go of my ego.
[201:28.66]Rest and then target.
[201:43.59]Make him feed you guys.
[201:44.86]Alright, you know what?
[201:45.52]Here, listen.
[201:46.14]Everybody relax.
[201:49.52]Open up your stream legends if you want it.
[201:54.41]I'm caving here.
[201:55.49]I usually do this at the end of the stream, usually.
[201:57.31]Extensions.
[202:03.28]Stream.
[202:03.60]Oh, we got it open.
[202:11.40]Ready?
[202:12.82]Three, two, one.
[202:14.98]There you go.
[202:24.41]I wasn't making it up.
[202:25.15]Look.
[202:27.89]Bro, I fucking love Monster Rancher.
[202:36.56]Well, so don't we here.
[202:40.65]We love this franchise here.
[202:42.29]Why don't you go give us a follow?
[202:48.29]Yes, and I mean all 3,098 people here.
[202:51.61]Alright, he's good.
[203:00.32]Competition 2.
[203:03.60]No, what is it?
[203:04.06]Oh, it's next week, right?
[203:04.86]It's this next week, okay.
[203:16.46]You are lively, but a little hungry.
[203:18.46]You'll be good after this.
[203:19.60]And then your tournament comes up.
[203:25.18]This will put him in a round.
[203:26.10]Nice.
[203:27.98]Plus 13.
[203:28.28]Ruberto has had at least 5 to 6 in a row.
[203:31.80]More than 10 stats.
[203:39.02]Alright, let's give him some food.
[203:40.82]Let's praise him, too.
[203:41.54]You're doing great.
[203:42.94]You're going to carry us all the way to B and C and A rank.
[203:50.68]Uh, no, you're gonna have to feed you.
[203:55.16]Uh, potato, I don't have... I don't know if you like carrots.
[203:57.88]Do you like carrots?
[204:01.97]You do, good.
[204:07.77]Alright, Roberto, get in there.
[204:12.49]3,000 bucks, and it's a fish.
[204:16.72]Ever so closer to potentially ranking up to B rank.
[204:30.48]Roberto versus Boonen.
[204:34.72]Boonen.
[204:36.72]Boonen has nearly 200 in every stat, which is really good.
[204:41.90]Lots of moves.
[204:43.20]Hard skin.
[204:46.44]This might be challenging.
[204:48.30]I almost have 300 attack power, though.
[204:54.24]Speed and intelligence are so bad.
[204:57.00]I don't know if that's going to be a bad thing for me.
[205:01.60]Almost 300 attack power, though.
[205:02.64]It's like a cockroach dog.
[205:17.31]Let's go.
[205:18.47]You know what's gonna happen here.
[205:19.41]Right off the bat.
[205:21.39]Nice.
[205:21.82]Got it.
[205:23.34]Getting close.
[205:23.96]Slash.
[205:25.40]Came over.
[205:25.80]You didn't even have a chance.
[205:29.15]I can't fuck around in these because once you get to like C and B, you can die in one or two hits.
[205:33.60]So I have to make it count.
[205:42.50]I can get one shot by some of these people.
[205:44.20]Alright, this is Tilden.
[205:51.53]Tilden 1.
[205:51.99]Why?
[205:52.19]That's why.
[206:00.64]My defense is so bad, too.
[206:02.90]202 power.
[206:06.04]It's just gonna come down to who hits first, essentially.
[206:10.14]Alright.
[206:20.28]I have better accuracy, don't I?
[206:23.80]Uh-oh.
[206:24.52]He got it first!
[206:26.77]Sorry, I'll answer it right here.
[206:29.21]Fuck, not good.
[206:30.01]Do it again.
[206:31.45]Come on, don't lose this here.
[206:33.32]Come on, don't lose it.
[206:36.08]Got it, nice.
[206:36.74]Alright, now get him in the slash, quick.
[206:41.78]Again, 70%.
[206:44.04]Alright.
[206:44.94]That was pretty risky.
[206:54.79]That's it.
[206:59.21]Du-pont.
[207:01.83]Uh, I guess, no, I can lose this here if I lose to Du-pont.
[207:08.88]How did you lose so many?
[207:11.66]That insane accuracy, insane speed, and high, terrible health though, that's probably how.
[207:17.08]125 health.
[207:27.65]Dupont, this should be one hit.
[207:30.73]See if I can get it.
[207:32.85]Got it.
[207:33.43]See you later.
[207:35.95]That move is so good.
[207:40.23]I just build power and accuracy.
[207:44.25]And I can just always open with that move and win.
[207:50.27]That strategy might not work getting into rank B and rank A, but at least I'll get there.
[208:00.63]Roberto is almost too famous.
[208:02.61]Almost 100 fame.
[208:03.45]Alright, so now we're gonna save the game, rest up a little, and then go in the cave.
[208:33.39]Alright.
[208:34.75]Schedule.
[208:35.39]So we've got... Everyone's tired.
[208:38.59]Let's just have this be a day of rest for everybody.
[208:42.21]And then you're going full-on sandbag, sandbag.
[208:47.96]Accuracy.
[208:50.04]Accuracy.
[208:50.98]Alright, everybody go to bed.
[209:04.15]Food has to go around here.
[209:05.23]Everyone's very hungry.
[209:10.46]Yeah, these guys are just bait to go do the adventure mode.
[209:23.42]Alright, I'm out of food.
[209:29.64]Hates carrots.
[209:30.88]Hates potatoes, hates carrots.
[209:35.17]I can't... No.
[209:36.13]I'm sorry.
[209:37.37]I think it's time for you to go into the fucking... Yeah.
[209:41.31]I'm sorry.
[209:41.75]You suck.
[209:43.79]You're too hard to deal with.
[209:46.66]We'll get a new monster.
[209:52.42]You're fine.
[209:53.14]You're good to go, Roberto.
[209:56.04]Hates Jeremy.
[209:57.16]I remember that.
[209:57.80]That was so funny.
[209:59.52]Alright.
[210:00.98]Alright.
[210:03.01]Weekend activities, let's go find the mushroom.
[210:21.92]Crush it right now?
[210:22.72]Not yet.
[210:30.54]So we have to find a healing mushroom.
[210:34.06]I want Roberto to get all the experience here.
[210:37.04]Clank, clank, clank, clank...
[211:00.11]Did you beat Sekiro?
[211:01.14]Actually, I did not.
[211:03.44]I got to the Chained Ogre and lost 145 times and decided the game probably wasn't for me.
[211:09.84]So I just moved on.
[211:22.47]It was so good.
[211:24.71]It really is.
[211:28.23]These enemies are nothing now.
[211:32.59]Well, Energize leveled up to level three.
[211:36.99]Hard Head and Uncho.
[211:43.28]Okay.
[211:44.64]Can I do anything with this?
[211:48.30]Roberto's almost level six or seven.
[211:51.58]Hopefully he gets something else.
[212:04.27]Come on, mushroom!
[212:06.31]Or maybe another couple random encounters so Roberto can level up.
[212:14.90]Have you beaten Ender Dragon in Minecraft yet?
[212:17.88]No.
[212:18.64]Well, what happened was I... Actually, I got to a point in Minecraft, I started it, and... Found out the game just kind of wasn't for me.
[212:25.10]I got to a creeper, and it exploded, and I died to a creeper like ten times in a row, and I was like, I just don't think I can... This game's not for me, so I stopped playing.
[212:45.29]That one's actually true.
[212:47.49]Is it though?
[212:49.17]Almost level seven, come on.
[212:55.36]Did you ever beat Saxton Hale in Team Fortress 2?
[212:59.49]Well, no, because I opened up TF2 for the first time, and I don't know, I'm of the opinion that a first-person shooter should not have somebody that can kill you instantly from behind.
[213:12.74]So I got backstabbed, and I was like, what, this is not even a fucking first-person shooter, and I got irritated, so the game's just kind of not for me.
[213:35.44]177 damage.
[213:36.58]Can I go to a different cave?
[213:41.26]Did you ever graduate from high school?
[213:44.42]Well, no, what happened was I got to high school.
[213:47.20]I was in ninth grade and I just, I couldn't do it.
[213:49.34]The geometry was way too hard.
[213:51.62]So I just said like, yeah, fuck it.
[213:52.86]That's kind of not for me.
[213:53.76]So I just didn't do it.
[213:55.38]I stopped.
[213:59.10]High school, you know, just not for me.
[214:01.37]Level 7.
[214:02.85]Nothing at level 7.
[214:04.11]Why?
[214:05.19]Really?
[214:05.73]That's kind of dumb.
[214:08.05]It took a long time to get there.
[214:34.24]You can dodge one, you can dodge two, but you can't dodge three.
[214:37.67]You're dead.
[214:50.05]Yeah, I gotta get to a new zone.
[214:51.15]This experience is not good enough for Ruberto.
[214:58.08]Uh... should I explore everything?
[214:59.84]I feel like I have to find the mushroom.
[215:02.66]I feel like... is it a cutscene thing or... Could I have missed it here?
[215:17.34]I was watching a different streamer last night and somebody asked in chat if they died to Pinwheel.
[215:25.61]If you... even if you die to Pinwheel...
[215:28.26]That's alright.
[215:29.28]That's not even a big deal.
[215:31.40]Why is that some super unforgivable sin if you die to Pinwheel in Dark Souls?
[215:36.85]What if you happen to have like an itchy ass when you go into the encounter?
[215:40.77]I don't know, maybe you put your controller down because the cutscene came up and you went to go grab like a snack or Cheez-Its or something.
[215:57.27]Maybe you just got unlucky, and you just got hit.
[216:00.19]I don't know.
[216:03.09]That's not such a good deal.
[216:04.17]They didn't even have a chance.
[216:34.82]It's not like losing to the divine dragon.
[216:40.46]Don't leave.
[216:42.74]Roberto can't help you investigate this.
[216:46.04]Can any of you... I don't... This part... I don't understand this.
[216:52.33]Who can help me investigate these things?
[216:54.09]Do you have to be like a water monster or something?
[217:01.23]I'm just gonna let Peruvia get hit in the head in this next encounter.
[217:16.04]Mushroom.
[217:19.18]Where's a mushroom?
[217:24.97]Peruvia can't help you with that.
[217:26.73]I don't think anybody can.
[217:29.63]What about Roberto?
[217:32.83]Roberto can't help you with that.
[217:34.61]Oh, fuck.
[217:41.21]Sorry.
[217:48.70]Prover is the healing shroom.
[217:53.54]What?
[217:53.94]Oh.
[217:57.48]Look how good you are.
[218:05.66]Actually, kinda good.
[218:07.68]He's got very high intelligence.
[218:15.90]And it's poison.
[218:19.64]Got a teddy bear.
[218:21.86]Alright.
[218:34.60]The bunny can't fit in there, I don't think.
[218:39.42]Mushroom.
[218:40.22]Obtain silver coin.
[218:43.08]Not a mushroom.
[218:45.30]Yeah, we tried to put the bunny in there last time.
[218:51.80]Nobody can do anything with that.
[218:57.93]Can you give the teddy bear to my little brother?
[219:01.67]No, it's mine.
[219:10.49]You ever see those video clips of the baseball home runs?
[219:15.55]Where there's somebody sitting next to a little kid, and there's a big home run, wow!
[219:20.29]And the guy or girl or whatever reaches over the kid and grabs the home run and says, cheers!
[219:27.26]And doesn't give it to the kid.
[219:28.36]That's what I do.
[219:38.25]Isn't that part of a Will Ferrell movie?
[219:46.59]Probably.
[219:47.22]Yeah.
[219:49.84]I would assume.
[219:53.40]I caught it!
[219:53.98]I caught the ball!
[219:55.90]I caught the ball!
[219:56.62]I did it!
[219:57.72]No!
[219:59.72]No!
[220:01.31]You cannot have the ball!
[220:02.53]No!
[220:02.99]It's my ball!
[220:03.87]No!
[220:04.99]Probably something like that.
[220:26.47]Yeah, but you probably root for the Red Sox, so it makes sense.
[220:37.08]All sports fans are the same sports fans.
[220:44.36]As Jerry Seinfeld once said, you're rooting for Laundrie.
[221:06.43]God damn it!
[221:07.01]I mean, I... whatever, I should be... I should be trying to level them up anyways Come on, 46% chance Poison.
[221:19.66]Well, now I have no guns No, of course you want to support your team, right?
[221:28.83]I like the Red Sox because they grew up in the area and they, you know, had a stadium
[221:35.37]It's fun to go to games and, hey, this is the team where I live.
[221:47.32]I think wrestling is... Well, wrestling now I don't think is cooler.
[221:51.86]But the idea of wrestling is cooler, I think.
[221:54.78]Because it's a theater show where they actually, like, hurt each other.
[221:57.54]Kind of.
[222:00.43]And there's, like, in baseball...
[222:04.14]If they were, like, dramatic story arcs.
[222:07.70]Where, you know, at one point, the center fielder got, like, kidnapped or something.
[222:13.52]And an old guy with, like, a vase came out, and halfway through the fourth inning, like, resurrected the center fielder or something.
[222:24.15]I imagine there was, like, the wacky bullshit from wrestling in baseball and football.
[222:33.75]Yeah, turns out, I don't know what happened.
[222:35.41]The entire outfield is not here.
[222:38.30]We haven't seen the entire outfield in two straight days, but they're going to play the game anyways.
[222:44.66]And it's just the infield, and there's like fly balls going over their heads and shit.
[222:47.60]And then finally, after like four of like a five, maybe six innings, it cuts to backstage of the outfielders coming into the stadium.
[222:58.27]They're getting in.
[222:58.85]Oh, there they are, the outfielders.
[223:00.29]Here they are.
[223:00.77]They made it to the stadium.
[223:03.22]And then a car drives and runs two of them over.
[223:08.42]Oh my goodness!
[223:09.24]I got run over by the car!
[223:10.68]Who is that?
[223:12.10]It's like the manager of the other team.
[223:16.69]Oh my god!
[223:17.51]Oh, that's Bill Broski!
[223:19.33]The third base coach for the Orioles!
[223:27.85]And then the one outfielder that has to play every position.
[223:35.48]Imagine if the wrestling weird shit was in other sports.
[223:43.84]Instead of the pitcher walking from the bullpen, they had him do an elaborate entrance.
[223:50.14]He comes up from the ground and there's fire around the mound.
[223:53.96]Like Gangrel used to do back in the Attitude Era.
[224:06.29]He drinks from a goblet of blood?
[224:16.26]That's what Gangrel used to do that.
[224:17.56]Where the hell is this mushroom?
[224:27.02]And all of them, instead of special moves, they had special- No, they still had their finishing moves.
[224:34.99]But it was weird pitches, and wacky baseball batting stances.
[224:40.52]And you knew when he did the weird fucked up stance, it was his finishing move, and he might hit a home run here.
[224:49.45]The pitcher changes their windup to be their finishing move windup, and it's like, here it is!
[224:54.93]The quirky ball!
[225:05.40]Mario... This is just making Mario games real life.
[225:10.84]That's what it is.
[225:13.90]Mario baseball is just what I'm describing.
[225:19.69]Mario Super Slugger.
[225:25.85]But wouldn't that be fun?
[225:38.75]Stream it.
[225:40.81]Stream what?
[225:42.19]Baseball?
[225:53.54]Somebody asked earlier, what's with all the violent sports references?
[226:01.24]What?
[226:01.52]What are you talking about?
[226:08.53]Yeah, and they'd have, like, weird special abilities.
[226:10.63]Like, I know, like, we're talking about Mario Sluggers, but imagine if somebody... was like this really, like, decrepit, small, old man came up to the mound.
[226:21.61]It's like, oh, here it is.
[226:22.47]This is Old Man... Beepo.
[226:28.91]I don't know.
[226:29.33]Whatever.
[226:29.61]I couldn't think of a name.
[226:31.89]He comes up and he's like, and he gets to the mound, and everyone's like, oh, wait, I just knew this guy sucks.
[226:36.23]Like, who's this guy?
[226:36.89]He's terrible.
[226:38.31]And he pulls up, and everyone knows, of course, Old Man Beeple's got the cannon.
[226:43.85]He sucks himself, but he's got a great item.
[226:46.32]He gets on the mound, and he loads the baseball into the cannon.
[226:49.56]And it, like, shoots into the catcher's mitt at, like, 7,000 miles per hour.
[227:02.83]The catcher would have to just get out of the way.
[227:11.20]No, the catcher gets a special item too.
[227:12.99]That's why you have these two guys work together.
[227:14.91]One of your catchers has like a metal plate for a catcher's mitt.
[227:24.71]And he does like a fucking comedy stance when he loads the thing and does the lights the fuse.
[227:29.89]He lights the fuse and then jumps back and goes, puts his fingers, both fingers in his ears and crouches down and everyone screams.
[227:54.02]Old Man Gnome?
[227:55.14]No, no, he just screams.
[227:58.18]Crouches down.
[227:58.92]There's gotta be a loud one!
[228:14.73]Mario Kart Double Dash, but with WWE wrestlers.
[228:17.69]Didn't they do that already?
[228:20.15]Energize obtained Cave Surge.
[228:22.02]Really?
[228:25.78]Does it move to have to learn?
[228:28.08]Yeah, they already did that.
[228:31.23]Yeah, I streamed that game.
[228:36.35]I forgot.
[228:36.83]That's true.
[228:38.77]That was a stream on this channel.
[228:50.64]I genuinely thought that you made the known video for a while.
[228:54.62]What?
[229:09.21]I did two.
[229:12.83]No, I didn't... Ten community subs just came in from Pinman.
[229:20.09]Thank you for the ten... community subs.
[229:28.21]Big sub drop, thank you.
[229:38.29]Ooh, that was quick.
[229:38.99]I think I'll probably get to level 8 after this one.
[229:42.39]Maybe I'll learn something new.
[229:51.13]Something at level 8.
[229:51.81]A new trait.
[229:52.85]New passive.
[229:55.52]There it is, Roberto mastered Midair.
[229:59.08]Midair.
[230:02.83]Midair.
[230:07.05]Is that his finisher?
[230:13.59]Mid- holy shit.
[230:16.75]Life damage, S. Accuracy, A.
[230:26.13]This is what I'm using now.
[230:27.23]What is this?
[230:27.77]This is short range.
[230:30.55]Takes almost my entire guts meter.
[230:32.23]Takes 50 guts.
[230:37.14]So it has to go in this short range slot.
[230:40.42]But, holy crap, that's... I have to put it... I'm gonna replace kick.
[230:47.48]I'm gonna try this out.
[230:49.90]I'm actually gonna do this too.
[230:51.44]I'm gonna put charge down here.
[230:53.30]I'm gonna put turn slash here.
[230:56.77]I'm gonna put regular slash here.
[231:00.69]And then midair here.
[231:03.85]Let's see what this does.
[231:22.67]This has the highest damage you can possibly have for a move in the game.
[231:29.90]And one of the highest accuracy ratings.
[231:31.66]Let's see how it is.
[231:34.16]Midair.
[231:38.72]Wow.
[231:39.60]Uh, well.
[231:46.81]Oh, I don't know if, uh... I don't know if it's possible for me to lose.
[231:51.78]I think I will take this character 2S or at least A in ranking and wipe the floor with everyone.
[232:00.74]Because that move potentially will, doesn't matter, even a high health pool.
[232:06.95]So over 200, 220, 250 health is a lot of health.
[232:09.93]That's an instant kill move and it's one of the most accurate in the game.
[232:19.55]Rose Perfume.
[232:20.17]It's pronounced mid-ay-ray.
[232:22.91]Not mid-air.
[232:23.93]But don't tell me... But don't let me tell you how to live your life.
[232:30.47]Mid-a-ray.
[232:33.81]Mid-a-ray.
[232:41.29]Mid-air.
[232:42.57]Mid-ar.
[232:46.86]Mid-a-ray.
[232:47.32]Mid-a-ray.
[233:05.80]Prover!
[233:07.00]Flower Dance!
[233:07.72]This is it?
[233:17.01]Oh sick yeah sick yeah sick dude dude sick yeah yeah sick yeah
[233:25.15]Put in a little too much.
[233:25.85]The mushrooms are somewhere around here.
[233:30.29]What is it?
[233:31.45]I hear the voice of a monster.
[233:33.07]It's saying, be gone from my territory.
[233:38.29]Something's headed this way.
[233:40.37]Watch out!
[233:43.01]Blobster!
[233:44.27]Oh, something's coming!
[233:56.48]It's the Blobster!
[233:57.26]Don't worry.
[234:03.06]Let's kill him in one hit.
[234:05.92]Hmm, he dodged it.
[234:07.33]He dodged the mid-air.
[234:10.17]Not this one.
[234:13.07]Alright, let's clean it up with a swing.
[234:15.71]Alright, he has two guts.
[234:22.01]Relax.
[234:27.39]See you later, Blobster.
[234:29.61]Oh, I get it.
[234:30.01]He's a lobster.
[234:39.50]Wow, good thing I did that with Roberto.
[234:41.00]Almost level 9.
[234:45.99]Wow, that was a real tough one.
[234:47.29]Not really.
[234:48.97]Oh, look, Fane.
[234:49.69]Over there.
[234:49.99]The mushroom.
[234:55.78]I feel like I just did that on stream.
[234:59.42]I feel like I just activated one of my scenes.
[235:06.09]Can't believe you remembered this.
[235:09.07]Yeah, if I see something once, I rarely forget it.
[235:12.55]That's why when I picked up the Gaia Stone and saw the vision, I felt like I'd seen it before.
[235:18.36]Let's go home.
[235:18.88]We've got to give this to Maro.
[235:21.74]Yes, that's right.
[235:27.94]Joke incoming.
[235:29.94]Not really.
[235:36.28]February week four.
[235:39.49]Week four.
[235:41.91]Let's go give it a morrow.
[235:50.11]Save the game.
[235:51.85]What's versus data?
[235:54.64]I think that means you can bring monsters to your friend's house.
[236:03.28]You know what?
[236:06.24]Fuck it.
[236:08.98]Let's do it now.
[236:14.15]Actually, I want to do the... Let's see what we got for training here.
[236:21.24]We wanted power and accuracy with Roberto.
[236:24.85]It's plenty of power.
[236:26.81]That move's going to be incredible.
[236:28.69]And then undog... Incredible.
[236:32.33]Undodgeable.
[236:34.71]And I will win the entire video game with Roberto.
[236:50.62]Undoicable.
[236:51.62]Undogitable.
[236:52.35]Hey, these guys are gonna be DNA food.
[237:02.49]Oh, hungry, right.
[237:06.48]Um... Oh, you don't like any food.
[237:08.98]I have to go to the town.
[237:11.92]You can eat in a minute.
[237:14.34]You're fine.
[237:16.85]You're... Alright, I gotta buy some food.
[237:26.39]Who cares if it's going into the freezer anyways, that's true.
[237:32.34]Let's go give the healing mushroom.
[237:36.26]We found some healing mushrooms, here they are!
[237:38.86]Thanks so much, Fain.
[237:39.94]I'll make some medicine from the right away.
[237:46.69]You're too kind, Fain.
[237:47.69]My back feels just great.
[237:50.01]I have something to give you today.
[237:51.37]Here you are.
[237:52.23]It's going to be a license.
[237:54.27]A letter from Mr. Carnab.
[237:57.19]What?
[237:57.37]You mean the FIMBA President Carnab?
[238:03.85]Precisely.
[238:04.47]Carnab is an old friend of mine.
[238:05.68]I told him about you.
[238:07.36]Really?
[238:07.68]Let's see.
[238:08.28]It's going to be a license.
[238:11.04]Dear Fain, I heard about you from Maro and you sound like a truly admirable lad.
[238:16.18]And an excellent fighter.
[238:17.32]If anybody deserves a breeder's license, it's you.
[238:20.48]But the real world is not a simple place, so listen to my proposal.
[238:24.03]First, I ask of you a favor.
[238:27.45]Have you heard of the Kalaragi Jungle?
[238:30.49]Well, it's a very odd place.
[238:32.57]The jungle is littered with these gadget thingies, well, more like junk.
[238:36.77]And I want to investigate them.
[238:39.09]Would you please retrieve the junk, then?
[238:41.79]If you pass a little test, I'll give you your license.
[238:44.88]What do you think?
[238:51.04]He!
[238:52.24]Hard to believe he's a high-ranking association member.
[238:56.14]Tee hee.
[238:56.58]Well, how about it, Fane?
[238:57.54]Are you ready to take on the challenge?
[238:59.76]Of course.
[239:01.42]Explore the jungle and pick up the junk.
[239:12.71]Oh, uh, guys.
[239:14.60]I was never softlocked.
[239:17.02]I had to press X.
[239:25.81]So.
[239:27.57]Apparently there's that.
[239:28.73]We need food.
[239:39.47]Alright, we want... I need more carrots.
[239:43.61]Let's get like five of them.
[239:47.81]And then... Nobody wants potatoes anymore.
[239:51.49]Mangoes, everybody likes mangoes.
[239:53.52]Let's get ten of these.
[240:02.30]Library, who cares.
[240:03.30]Alright, now we have to do more jungle exploring.
[240:16.04]We have a new adventure unlocked.
[240:18.68]Probably going to be harder.
[240:20.30]It's alright.
[240:22.56]So this is Fane's Ranch.
[240:23.88]Hmm.
[240:25.70]Okay, here I go.
[240:27.70]Hello there!
[240:30.06]What are you doing here?
[240:31.72]Oh, well, I wanted to thank you for the other day, so... Shoot, you don't have to thank us.
[240:40.18]No, I do, and about the battles in Ruin, you better learn new battle techniques.
[240:45.27]If you don't learn counters, you'll have a hard time.
[240:48.37]I wanted to warn you.
[240:51.85]Counters.
[240:52.57]What kind of ability is that?
[240:54.29]Uh-oh.
[241:09.83]Time to learn a counter.
[241:13.37]To counter when an opponent attacks, hold the L2 button, then push the button you think they used.
[241:19.59]I'll use an X button move.
[241:29.12]Uh... So I have to guess what button they're pressing.
[241:36.64]But what do you mean, X?
[241:42.03]Yeah, but you can also change skills by pushing different buttons.
[241:45.39]Try performing a skill with the O button.
[241:53.67]Yes, with the O button you perform a skill precisely.
[241:57.49]Damage is lowered, but you make contact more often.
[242:00.73]Next try performing a skill with the square button.
[242:11.88]You perform a skill with force.
[242:13.54]What?
[242:16.10]How did we not know this before?
[242:20.56]Why is the tutorial for this... Yeah.
[242:23.25]Why is it halfway through the game?
[242:24.63]Well, it's not halfway through the game.
[242:27.89]So, circle is force.
[242:31.89]Does a lot of damage.
[242:34.43]X button.
[242:34.75]Yeah, that's what I've been doing this whole time.
[242:44.46]What does that do?
[242:44.97]I've been doing every single move with X. That's a nor- okay.
[242:48.67]Normally.
[242:50.55]Try using the X again to perform a skill.
[242:58.47]Two-hit chain.
[242:59.87]Using the same button repeatedly raises damage.
[243:05.56]so I have to guess at what button they press and okay thanks well phooey you get away from him girl huh tt you came all this way geez lay off and go home you sure are charming you must think you're king of the world
[243:36.70]Today I'll show you who's the real boss around here.
[243:39.75]Get your pesky assistant and prepare yourselves.
[243:43.29]Oh boy, well okay, let's make it a tag battle.
[243:46.33]Let's see what you got.
[243:48.25]Tag battle?
[244:00.30]That mechanic is the whole reason I dislike this game.
[244:04.78]I've had so many victories snatched away in S rank because of that... Oh.
[244:11.15]Alright, we're going up against your garbage in Calerino, okay.
[244:20.91]Time to learn about tag battles!
[244:23.73]First the tag, how to switch monsters.
[244:25.47]I've done it before, try it, it's L1.
[244:28.20]L1, tag out.
[244:30.10]Now you've switched.
[244:31.78]In tag battles you were able to use partnership powers.
[244:35.25]Take a deep breath, stay still, and wait.
[244:40.17]Team up.
[244:42.89]There, now your partnership power is charged.
[244:46.24]Now you can carry out a chase attack.
[244:49.74]While your partnership power is rising, the skill panel turns red.
[244:54.48]Select a panel and use a skill.
[244:56.78]After you perform a skill, the standby partner will do a chase attack.
[245:05.80]So that- alright.
[245:08.22]So you have to have the team up.
[245:11.60]Did we even- we didn't even play.
[245:26.09]Why you- you have the nerve to use combinations on me!
[245:31.86]This is just the pits, I'm going home.
[245:34.78]counters and tag moves.
[245:35.88]This is so cool.
[245:36.62]Thanks, Philia.
[245:38.54]Not at all.
[245:39.08]I'm glad you like them.
[245:41.04]Well, see you around, Fane.
[245:42.40]Best of luck.
[245:43.16]I can't wait to use those on you.
[245:44.52]Because you're going to be the champion of the next area, and I'm going to use tag maneuvers on you.
[245:54.13]And you're going to be fucking like, I can't believe I told you that!
[245:56.27]I told you those things!
[246:10.03]Alright.
[246:11.11]So, we can do... Let me see what's in the calendar.
[246:17.50]No official tournaments.
[246:20.08]So, I... I'm gonna... I just... We gotta just go to the jungle.
[246:24.82]Everybody, let's feed and... What do we got for schedules?
[246:27.32]Who's tired?
[246:28.80]Everyone's alright.
[246:30.20]Wait, what's the schedule?
[246:34.68]Book, High Jump, and Sandbag.
[246:37.40]And then we can feed everybody and then do the jungle.
[246:46.80]Or... We go... I don't think... Both of these guys just suck.
[246:52.64]Should we just make them DNA food and try to get some new monsters?
[246:58.31]Yeah.
[247:00.81]Sorry, Roger.
[247:05.06]I don't think he knew that I was just a mushroom this whole time.
[247:10.22]Stan?
[247:11.56]Stan, I can't believe you didn't see through my disguise.
[247:20.24]And you.
[247:21.61]These both suck.
[247:29.79]I want to go to town.
[247:35.61]Have some fish.
[247:44.66]We could do some combinations.
[247:47.04]Or I could put some discs in.
[247:48.04]Look at how hungry you are.
[247:51.86]Well, you just... Are they friends?
[247:56.43]They might not be friends to combine.
[248:03.86]What is it?
[248:04.10]What's this link?
[248:06.34]That is a long messy link Not a virus It's not that messy
[248:39.80]God.
[248:42.29]That crying face is gonna follow me forever.
[248:58.33]Let's see.
[249:01.69]Lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good.
[249:05.35]Lawful neutral, true neutral, chaotic neutral.
[249:10.90]Neutral Evil, Lawful Evil.
[249:17.48]Uh, Chaotic Neutral and Chaotic Evil are the same image.
[249:21.83]Except in Chaotic Evil, there's a little bit of gray hair dusting.
[249:27.99]Does having more gray hair makes me eviler?
[249:38.74]Yes, apparently.
[249:45.39]There's gray hair in all of them.
[249:46.61]The fuck there is.
[249:48.05]No there's not.
[249:50.10]I don't have gray hair.
[250:17.51]Alright, should we go to the Hava?
[250:28.14]Select the monster to be retired.
[250:29.42]Look at that.
[250:30.36]303 power.
[250:31.74]Energize sucks.
[250:43.84]160, 160, not good enough.
[250:45.52]241 and 212 really isn't bad, but you just aren't very good.
[251:11.69]Freeze, Roberto, or no balls.
[251:13.89]Why would I ever do that?
[251:19.52]I ranked up to another rank.
[251:20.58]Let's see if we can get some new monsters.
[251:25.88]I got a bunch of PlayStation 1 games over there.
[251:30.09]And some PlayStation 2.
[251:31.53]We'll try some of those.
[251:42.15]Create.
[251:44.37]I'd like to use a saucer stone.
[251:46.19]Alright, let me grab, hold on, let me grab some of those other discs over here.
[251:51.62]What do I have?
[252:02.03]Stuntman.
[252:04.05]Alias.
[252:07.73]The Ring.
[252:08.21]The Ring video game.
[252:11.72]Stuntman again?
[252:12.54]The Jackass game?
[252:15.80]Let's put in the... Let's put in the ring.
[252:29.99]Put in the Fallout Boy CD.
[252:31.35]I don't own... I don't own a Fallout Boy CD.
[252:34.71]There you go for proof.
[252:41.01]He could be putting anything in there.
[252:43.21]He could be putting the same thing in there.
[252:44.49]He's just acting on stream.
[252:46.61]I mean, I'm a fucking damn good actor.
[252:50.25]There's the ring.
[252:58.96]Burn the brown note onto a CD and then play that.
[253:05.45]And do that.
[253:07.52]I don't even have a burnable CD.
[253:12.10]I would have to burn, okay, I have a question.
[253:15.57]Those of you that, I don't have a CD-R or anything, but I have a question.
[253:21.73]Is it possible for me to burn over this?
[253:25.09]This is just a disk, right?
[253:27.47]Can I just delete this and burn over it?
[253:33.17]There's no way?
[253:39.86]Oh well.
[253:44.95]It's read only.
[253:53.29]Read only memory.
[254:08.08]So this is from the ring.
[254:13.89]Thank you for waiting.
[254:48.51]Well, let's put Alias in here.
[254:51.13]This is PlayStation 2.
[255:13.51]I think it actually might be the Dreamcast curse.
[255:15.57]Yeah.
[255:16.83]It's just Dreamcast.
[255:18.60]I didn't want to believe it.
[255:20.86]But now I do.
[255:41.03]Alias.
[255:43.07]something give me a new seed let's see something awesome something that I'll be proud to level up after this we'll do jackass the game
[256:15.14]Um... Alright.
[256:18.38]What the hell is this?
[256:21.12]It's a skullflower.
[256:25.39]Not a mushroom.
[256:31.51]I'll take a look at it.
[256:34.28]It's the mushroom, but it's dead.
[256:43.74]The Unprover?
[256:45.44]Unprover.
[256:47.90]Doomer.
[256:52.79]I like the Unprover.
[256:53.75]I don't think it'll fit, though.
[256:55.93]No, it doesn't fit.
[257:18.44]Unprover.
[257:26.52]I can do the actual word, but I can't do two O's the way that you want.
[257:30.74]Unprover.
[257:36.43]I can do unprover.
[257:42.43]The unprover.
[257:45.88]Unprover isn't a word.
[257:47.68]Yeah, I know.
[257:48.96]Unprover.
[257:54.46]Try another stone.
[257:59.28]This is jackass.
[258:02.98]What does that word mean?
[258:03.96]That means that you were... If you're a prover, that means you're proving something.
[258:12.55]No, fuck it to the... Whatever.
[258:16.40]So an unprover, that's weird to explain.
[258:19.88]I know what it means, but I can't explain what it means.
[258:23.86]Does that make sense?
[258:25.98]It means that you are supposed to be somebody that can prove things, but you're not being able to prove anything.
[258:32.51]You're a disprover, but you're unproving things.
[258:35.09]I can't explain it.
[258:35.73]You guys know what I mean.
[258:49.41]So debunk.
[258:51.45]No, no, no, but he's the prover.
[258:54.31]That's his name.
[258:56.61]His name is the prover.
[258:59.54]The unprover.
[259:01.94]I mean, we're not using, that's not the terminology, like proving something.
[259:05.28]It's his actual name.
[259:06.54]He's the prover.
[259:17.53]Guys, it's a proverb.
[259:18.47]Thank you.
[259:36.06]Unproverb.
[259:38.06]Unproverb.
[259:46.12]You guys are fucking hilarious.
[259:50.34]Alright.
[260:00.47]Jackass the game.
[260:01.47]Let's see what we can get.
[260:07.55]Unfunny.
[260:17.72]Unsubbed.
[260:20.10]OH MY GOD!
[260:22.44]OH MY!
[260:24.47]OHHHHH!
[260:29.71]I wasn't even in frame.
[260:37.39]We got a dragon.
[260:40.93]That is from Jackass.
[260:45.38]The PlayStation 2 video game.
[260:49.08]Wow, okay.
[260:50.35]Well, I know who we're gonna be playing with.
[260:52.23]Freeze him?
[260:52.85]No, thank you.
[260:55.07]Take this monster home.
[260:56.33]Uh-huh.
[261:24.86]Damn it!
[261:28.22]I can't do Roid Spyro?
[261:38.54]Steve-o?
[261:41.89]I can do Spyro.
[261:45.21]How do you pronounce it?
[261:46.71]Spy-roid.
[261:49.03]Spy-roid.
[261:50.85]That's pretty good.
[262:00.29]Spyroids.
[262:01.17]Alright, there you go.
[262:04.93]Spyroid.
[262:10.41]That sounds like an illness.
[262:11.83]Oh yeah, I got Spyroids.
[262:20.34]Add a heart at the end.
[262:21.66]No.
[262:29.51]Remove the S. Spyroid.
[262:33.25]Yes.
[262:33.89]We gotta take this monster back now.
[262:42.89]Hurry up.
[262:43.41]I need to see the stats.
[262:44.29]The base stats here.
[262:54.55]Combine Spyroid and Roberto to make a god.
[262:59.76]Wow, you're fucking huge.
[263:00.77]Alright, let's see.
[263:01.55]Come on.
[263:07.25]Uh... 163 intelligence.
[263:09.49]Base.
[263:14.55]Why is everybody laughing?
[263:17.97]That base intellect.
[263:19.24]Level 9, 163 base intellect.
[263:21.58]Don't... He's bad.
[263:22.42]Okay.
[263:22.88]He is.
[263:23.16]It's alright, though.
[263:29.37]Is the Unprover better?
[263:30.25]153... No.
[263:30.89]What about the moves?
[263:33.09]Fire.
[263:33.33]Fire and Bite.
[263:35.35]And then power moves with the tail.
[263:38.96]D-Bite.
[263:41.32]What is D-Bite?
[263:59.81]Alright, what about you, Unprover?
[264:00.93]What do you got?
[264:01.33]I kind of like Unprover.
[264:05.98]Let me see again.
[264:07.84]What do you have for moves?
[264:10.66]Uh, this is Pecking and Pollen.
[264:16.36]Kind of like the other one, but much better base stats.
[264:22.11]Yeah, they're not gonna hand us a god character, that's true.
[264:24.65]He's good!
[264:27.01]163 base stats at just being born is really actually pretty good.
[264:32.88]147 power, 163, and just... mash intellect.
[264:37.92]And, um, accuracy.
[264:42.22]And can be used for a fusion later as well.
[264:44.14]This is true.
[264:46.70]Alright, um, let's get him in.
[264:48.10]Let's get him into the, uh... Let's go!
[264:52.50]Intellect and accuracy.
[264:56.74]Or maybe I'll just hammer accuracy for a little while.
[265:01.17]Let's hammer accuracy.
[265:14.84]and then uh rest we'll bring up uh intelligence book it'll be a smart dragon rest and we'll go to more accuracy and we'll take a look at it after that alright you on the other hand what do you need
[265:43.11]Uh, defense and intelligence, maybe.
[265:46.25]We kind of need a lot of things.
[265:48.81]Intelligence and accuracy.
[265:51.41]Defense and speed, maybe.
[265:53.49]Defense and life.
[265:54.05]I'm gonna say defense and life for now.
[266:18.54]Okay.
[266:19.80]And then we'll take a look at it afterwards there.
[266:21.52]Maybe the book gets an hint.
[266:24.83]Now you, on the other hand, you're doing just fine, but you also need to rest here.
[266:30.09]And then we'll do power.
[266:33.75]Let's take a look.
[266:34.27]Here we go.
[266:40.18]That's a lot for being zero years old.
[266:47.50]I'm proof it didn't do very well.
[266:52.54]What does this dragon like to eat?
[266:56.48]Good job!
[267:01.95]Save, I'll save, I'll save, I'll save, I'll save, I'll save.
[267:03.75]That's the skull.
[267:14.67]And you're doing fine too.
[267:15.53]Alright.
[267:16.49]Proceed to the weekend activities.
[267:17.89]Let's... Should I just take them?
[267:20.53]Yeah, let's just take them out to the jungle.
[267:24.46]I have Roberto.
[267:25.12]Roberto can just carry everybody.
[267:26.80]Free experience.
[267:28.58]Free EXP.
[267:31.88]Maybe Roberto should just go.
[267:42.66]I'll save.
[267:43.14]Yeah, save first.
[267:43.94]Okay.
[268:02.10]Ruberto's so much better than everyone else?
[268:03.48]Yeah, but he's also a lot older.
[268:07.82]Think of it this way.
[268:08.48]If I do three or four weeks of intelligence with the dragon, there'll be over 200 intelligence.
[268:17.29]That's pretty great, actually.
[268:21.29]Alright, target, sandbag, and lifeblade.
[268:28.77]Game is saved, and we'll take everybody into the jungle.
[268:31.59]After this.
[268:37.29]I'll tell you though, he's got... Really, really good... Stat... Uh, stat adding.
[268:46.54]Usually it takes him to like at least six months before they start getting that much.
[268:49.96]So he'll be really good.
[268:55.85]Stat adding.
[268:56.83]Okay, what does he eat though?
[269:03.19]Are you gonna be mad if I give you, like, a carrot?
[269:13.41]Is that thank you, or is that no thank you?
[269:16.07]Okay.
[269:23.00]You're doing just fine.
[269:23.94]I think you eat, uh, you eat mangoes and shit.
[269:34.03]I can't believe we got a dragon and a jackass.
[269:40.84]Okay.
[269:41.10]Uh, I think it's time.
[269:44.94]Let's say good job to you two.
[269:56.04]Proceed to the weekend, head to the jungle, and let's continue, because I want to be able to do higher ranks.
[270:04.83]Bring everybody.
[270:05.53]It's just free experience for the other two, because they're not going to take any damage.
[270:11.61]At least I hope not.
[270:27.04]Jungle.
[270:27.46]So we're just supposed to explore this and find the junk, right?
[270:34.72]You currently have unlocked Dragon and Robot.
[270:38.12]You can get a cool Robot Dragon, or Bone Dragon, or Shroom Dragon.
[270:43.17]And the one I have right now is part Naga, so it lets fish.
[270:49.96]Okay.
[270:51.78]Good to know.
[271:04.96]Let's see what happens.
[271:11.30]Uh, well.
[271:15.95]That's it.
[271:16.69]Even in the next area, he's too good.
[271:20.63]He might be too good.
[271:25.69]Level 9.
[271:27.83]Obtained Wind Lore.
[271:31.18]I don't know what that means.
[271:32.88]Let's find out.
[271:35.63]So there's a fish type, that's funny.
[271:39.03]What is wind lore?
[271:44.68]Ups wind and fire power and lets you add a wind power to skill.
[271:49.86]I still don't get how that works.
[272:00.16]I could combine Roberto and the dragon and get a metal dragon.
[272:05.35]That would be crazy.
[272:06.35]Well, I got an intelligence stone.
[272:08.31]Whatever that means.
[272:26.22]help for your information yeah I know I know I've read it the first time that's so good
[272:54.57]I'm gonna play with a Spyroid for a little bit, try to get him some levels.
[272:57.44]Am I using Square?
[273:07.19]I'm just using X at the moment.
[273:11.27]That system's kind of weird.
[273:30.64]I bring out the dragon.
[273:42.99]What the hell are you guys doing over here?
[273:47.75]Now, you know the car?
[273:48.57]When you're driving the car?
[273:49.55]I know there's a gas pedal, but there's also a brake.
[273:58.11]You might want to put your foot on the brake and just gently put your foot on it and press it a little.
[274:02.83]Uh-huh.
[274:13.83]And do a drift.
[274:17.16]Hey, as long as you start to slow down a little.
[274:19.08]Come on, where's the stuff?
[274:28.09]This stuff here?
[274:28.67]Can I touch anything with the bushes or anything?
[274:36.56]No.
[274:36.62]I want to see what the fire looks like.
[274:57.48]What is that thing?
[274:59.52]Spyroids, let's see.
[275:00.86]Fire.
[275:05.42]That is such a weird monster, seriously.
[275:08.85]Holy shit, this thing's amazing.
[275:12.27]Real.
[275:13.33]Shit just got real.
[275:24.12]Come on.
[275:24.42]I probably should have tried to counter that.
[275:27.25]Oh boy, don't die.
[275:34.15]That was awesome.
[275:35.79]So you gotta do those quick and guess it correctly.
[275:38.53]So you have a 1 in 3 chance to get that right.
[275:40.46]And you have to do it fast.
[275:45.04]Got him with the anime move.
[275:48.56]Hard skin.
[275:49.14]And detail.
[275:58.08]Level up a couple more times.
[275:59.05]See if I can get another move or two there.
[276:05.19]It doesn't very much health, but... Roberto carry.
[276:10.83]Can somebody dig?
[276:14.48]Can Spyroid dig?
[276:17.38]Actually, no.
[276:17.74]You have to learn it, don't you?
[276:19.06]Yeah.
[276:21.92]Something that you learn by leveling up.
[276:33.39]Burn.
[276:38.07]That's big.
[276:38.55]Let's go big on it.
[276:39.41]Power move.
[276:41.91]Real.
[276:42.27]I don't know what that even means.
[276:45.29]He blocked it.
[276:48.91]Blocked it again.
[276:49.53]Uh-oh.
[276:54.10]He's bullish.
[276:54.66]Uh-oh.
[276:57.14]Uh-oh.
[276:57.64]Uh-oh.
[276:58.02]He's gotta hit it here.
[276:58.68]Uh-oh!
[277:01.28]I missed.
[277:16.27]Well.
[277:19.65]Jackass dragon.
[277:22.78]Oh well.
[277:23.16]How are you still here?
[277:41.70]Well, he was just bullish half the time.
[277:43.28]Nice dodge.
[277:52.62]One stack counter.
[277:53.38]Now you're dead.
[277:57.91]Lower lifespan.
[277:58.81]Well, he shouldn't have missed four of the moves I tried!
[278:03.07]What does bullish even mean?
[278:04.19]Like, stupid?
[278:19.62]It means stubborn.
[278:24.12]Well, don't be so stubborn!
[278:26.66]Otherwise it's gonna get you killed!
[278:27.94]He learned.
[278:40.73]He'll figure it out.
[278:47.26]He's just a baby.
[278:58.29]I know what bullish means.
[279:01.04]Bullish in like a stock market term is not what they mean in this game.
[279:07.82]It's like a financial term that they're not like, oh, things are looking bullish.
[279:19.21]Not this again.
[279:19.99]I didn't say it.
[279:22.94]I didn't bring it up.
[279:24.20]I tried to fight to stop it from happening.
[279:36.51]Nothing?
[279:38.91]How can I cross this?
[279:56.17]Oh, almost got the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles boss character.
[280:10.49]Ah, goddammit.
[280:11.77]The bottom of this thing.
[280:19.90]Almost all ten!
[280:20.50]So it's not this way.
[280:30.83]Wherever this random junk that this guy wants is not here.
[280:51.25]This should be level 10.
[280:51.79]Hopefully we get something good at level 10.
[281:02.98]Actually countered it.
[281:05.06]Unbelievable.
[281:12.11]Dude.
[281:13.17]Alright.
[281:13.75]So it's just turned... This just turned into a guessing game?
[281:26.36]Yes.
[281:28.80]Really?
[281:29.18]Oh, come on.
[281:38.13]If you don't try to counter, you can still block it.
[281:42.01]Welcome to the reason why I said go back to two.
[281:47.57]Well, we're already disinvested.
[281:51.75]Magic Lore for Roberto.
[281:53.03]Unprevered Tame Sniper.
[281:55.46]Roberto mastered air shot.
[281:59.58]And Unprover has slap now.
[282:03.05]Air shot.
[282:07.53]What is air shot?
[282:15.45]Air shot.
[282:16.07]Accuracy A. So it's an intelligence move.
[282:20.96]Was it like a moonlit sword move?
[282:25.25]That's a lot of Guts Damage.
[282:27.53]I think that's the highest Guts Damage thing I have.
[282:29.11]Yeah.
[282:30.03]So this is a Far Range.
[282:33.43]I can put it pretty much anywhere.
[282:34.45]I need to put it in the bars.
[282:38.00]So, my Intelligence is terrible, though.
[282:41.34]And I also got Magic Roar.
[282:45.00]Up's Magic Power?
[282:48.80]Uh, what about the other... ...unprover?
[282:53.87]Got pecking slap.
[282:57.89]Slap is A accuracy, much better accuracy.
[283:01.56]But does barely any damage.
[283:03.24]This is kind of just a light move to maybe get one last tap in.
[283:10.16]For them to guess and block it.
[283:25.53]Alright, let me find this thing.
[283:34.77]Great, now the other baby is gonna die.
[283:36.77]No, he's not.
[283:38.87]Check it.
[283:39.57]Nope.
[283:44.48]If he gets hit once, Roberto's coming.
[283:46.22]Okay, well, Roberto's coming.
[283:50.42]Roberto, get it.
[283:52.38]Roberto, please.
[283:53.82]Let's try it.
[283:54.60]Air shot.
[283:57.05]That's pretty cool.
[283:58.39]You know, if you have to zone somebody up.
[284:03.97]Oh fuck.
[284:07.17]Don't let that happen.
[284:08.85]I could get out of here!
[284:17.91]They're almost dead.
[284:18.67]This is bad.
[284:19.31]I don't want to lose any more health.
[284:20.67]I hope it's in this box.
[284:21.61]They're not prepared for this yet.
[284:28.53]Oh shit.
[284:29.49]Oh no.
[284:31.91]Good.
[284:37.00]Alright, I need to get to the menu.
[284:59.35]I need to sort first before this happens.
[285:02.21]Put Roberto up front.
[285:03.69]Because otherwise he's just going to get hit and die.
[285:05.73]Item.
[285:07.13]Do I have anything?
[285:09.99]No.
[285:12.30]Ooh.
[285:13.06]Use when combining to regenerate a monster with higher intelligence.
[285:15.94]That's pretty cool.
[285:16.52]Alright.
[285:18.68]Please be in here.
[285:19.88]Toy.
[285:20.38]Junk.
[285:25.84]Get me out of here!
[285:26.62]Before somebody dies!
[285:30.56]Fuck.
[285:31.58]This is bad.
[285:32.14]Let's just hope for no random battle.
[285:37.69]This is it, right?
[285:46.15]Look at this huge area.
[285:55.65]That's good.
[285:56.25]Maintain a speed stone.
[286:01.34]Oh my god, this is so huge.
[286:02.88]No, don't do this.
[286:12.39]Got it.
[286:12.83]Come on.
[286:14.27]Oh, you piece of shit.
[286:29.70]No, he's... My health is fine.
[286:31.04]How do I get the full health from him?
[286:41.96]Can you do something, please?
[286:45.01]Oh my god.
[286:46.31]Are you serious?
[286:52.27]He's so strong.
[286:54.01]I can't do any fucking moves?
[286:57.15]Kill him!
[286:59.17]Oh...
[287:10.35]Uh, Jexitoop.
[287:13.45]Uh, thank you, Jexitoop, for the 50 bucks.
[287:16.85]5,000 bits just came in right now.
[287:25.21]Thank you for the $50, Jexitoop.
[287:31.30]Oh, God, this is bad.
[287:34.63]And, Jackson Tip, you say, I hear you used to be a substitute teacher.
[287:37.59]Do you have any stories, or is that just a rumor?
[287:39.67]Thanks for the laughs.
[287:40.35]You're pretty good.
[287:41.81]Hey, thanks.
[287:43.77]Um, I've told a few stories before.
[287:46.15]There was one time where I just had a British accent the whole time.
[287:48.99]I just pretended like I was just British.
[287:50.87]That was it.
[287:52.85]I used to draw shit on the board.
[287:55.75]I used to draw puzzles on the board to have people try to solve.
[287:58.54]They were called, uh, they were called whatzits.
[288:03.12]that's a friends episode alright we got dirt search so now I can search the dirt on the ground but I need to activate this but yeah I I did do substitute teaching what grade did you teach I was a professor in college uh what's up rio

[288:34.12]This is the Gaia Stone.
[288:36.93]My old friend, can you hear me?
[288:39.27]The same voice that I heard back in the cave.
[288:43.57]Destroyed and battled, my soul fled into a stone.
[288:46.67]Even without corporeal form, I am here to help you.
[288:51.41]Just who are you?
[288:52.95]I offer you support and guidance to help you keep the world from once again falling to darkness.
[289:00.51]Close your eyes.
[289:01.55]Gaze upon the fate that must be prevented.
[289:13.80]What is it, Ryo?
[289:17.58]This rock, it's... I mean, it's nothing, sorry.
[289:21.12]Let's go.
[289:25.08]Thank God.
[289:29.76]Those are all in-game sounds.
[289:31.60]Yeah.
[289:36.26]It's got some good sound effects.
[289:39.68]So now I should be able to go get my license.
[289:42.01]Let's go to the association.
[289:43.33]Let me save it though.
[289:57.39]uh so let's see let's go to the schedule no no the calendar roberto needs to do one more tournament so this one here until they're able to try to rank up to b
[290:22.08]So let me see what I got here.
[290:23.54]Schedule.
[290:24.12]Let's do some more.
[290:26.02]You should rest.
[290:26.96]You should rest.
[290:28.38]You should do target practice.
[290:29.58]Yes.
[290:30.80]And then rest.
[290:33.14]And then we'll go back to the association.
[290:40.13]Food.
[290:40.91]Let's give you a mango.
[290:51.55]I like you because you eat all the food I give you.
[290:56.13]You don't complain about eating a potato or a mango.
[290:59.46]You don't have one specific food that you like to eat.
[291:04.56]Alright, association time.
[291:08.76]It's because robots don't have taste buds.
[291:20.97]Did I not complete the task?
[291:23.29]Hello, welcome to our library.
[291:26.35]How can I help you?
[291:32.29]That guy sent me the letter and I did it.
[291:37.77]I don't understand.
[291:41.31]Give me some... That's where the man goes.
[291:54.24]Do you sell fish or any meat?
[291:56.44]How do you not sell meat?
[291:59.31]Back to town.
[292:00.93]Um... I don't understand the next part of this.
[292:04.65]I didn't get the junk?
[292:09.57]Oh.
[292:27.21]Guys, I gotta pee again.
[292:28.53]Or stim.
[292:28.81]I haven't even taken a bunch of liquid.
[292:32.57]He's already signed up.
[292:44.18]Yeah, time to pee again.
[292:45.28]I... Sometimes this just happens.
[292:46.79]Sometimes... Okay, I will stream for eight to ten hours sometimes, and pee once.
[292:54.67]And then I will stream... We'll be gone for five hours, and pee like four times.
[293:00.53]I don't get it.
[293:12.71]It's another vicious pee.
[293:15.71]No, hey, I've been to the doctor.
[293:17.43]I've had, like, tons of blood work done and tons of examinations done over the last few months.
[293:24.58]My blood is clean.
[293:26.38]My body is apparently clean.
[293:33.36]I pee-tested, too.
[293:35.28]I peed into the jar.
[293:40.00]Everything seems to be normal.
[293:41.16]I think it's just when I drink, like, certain coffee.
[293:42.94]I don't know.
[293:44.62]But, whatever.
[294:24.52]Thank you.
[295:09.35]you
[295:47.30]Alright.
[295:48.36]That should be the last time I have to pee before calling it a night.
[295:55.09]Also, I do want to make this aware to all of you.
[296:00.78]Uh, schedule... I don't have a schedule, but... I'm gonna be jumping all over the place here.
[296:05.71]Sorry there's been, like, one day off, one day on, one day off, one day on, two days off, one day on, one day off.
[296:12.07]Uh, but tomorrow, there's no stream tomorrow.
[296:15.21]I was gonna go two or three days in a row, but we're just gonna move that forward, and I'm gonna end up going Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[296:23.96]There's just been, like, some obligations that I've had to do...
[296:28.88]So, sorry it's been like one day on, one day off, one day on, one day off.
[296:35.46]But I'm gonna lock in.
[296:38.44]There's quite a bit to do.
[296:40.43]The stream's still going.
[296:41.15]I'm not stopping now.
[296:42.79]This might be, you know, an end of the stream voice.
[296:44.97]But it's not.
[296:48.37]I have, I told you, Twitch has approved of my scratch-off stream.
[296:54.44]So that's gonna happen.
[296:56.04]Risk of Rain with Etalyx.
[296:58.04]Maybe more Monster Hunter 4.
[296:59.06]Some more VR, maybe.
[297:03.76]And something else very special.
[297:05.56]Something very, very special.
[297:09.64]Will also be happening.
[297:12.52]During that period of three streams in a row.
[297:16.99]Late April Fools?
[297:17.83]No, no, no, no.
[297:18.53]A lot of you already know what it is.
[297:20.73]But... It looks really, really fucking cool.
[297:26.59]So, nothing tomorrow.
[297:27.73]But we're gonna go, like I said, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[297:32.60]Not Labo.
[297:33.30]No.
[297:34.61]Something way more special than just playing Labo.
[297:43.49]Clown car.
[297:45.21]No.
[297:47.31]But.
[297:48.97]Let's keep going.
[297:49.45]I just want to make sure people wear that.
[297:51.53]That there's not going to be anything tomorrow.
[297:52.83]We're going to come back on Thursday.
[297:54.19]And I will do it.
[297:55.31]I will do three days in a row after tomorrow.
[298:00.39]Just things kind of keep coming up that I have to take care of.
[298:04.03]And they fall at the time periods where it just makes it so I can't stream.
[298:09.34]But let's go.
[298:10.74]Let's continue for like another couple hours.
[298:15.84]We've got... Alright.
[298:19.24]I need to go find the junk.
[298:22.38]He's already signed up for this one.
[298:25.46]What have we got?
[298:26.06]How old is Roberto?
[298:29.32]Because this is...
[298:35.45]Roberto is a year and a half, almost.
[298:42.75]I got it.
[298:45.95]Roberto is a year and a half.
[298:49.98]He's only... We gotta get him up there now.
[298:55.50]So much power.
[298:57.12]Let's get over 200 accuracy.
[298:59.74]And then I'm gonna move into...
[299:02.87]Once he gets over, like, 220 accuracy, I think... We'll split it between... Power and speed?
[299:10.15]Or power and life?
[299:11.69]Power and d... Probably power and life.
[299:14.21]Maybe a little bit of defense.
[299:21.58]So, he's resting today.
[299:22.50]He's gonna do... Get that... Okay, yeah.
[299:24.08]We'll do two.
[299:26.44]Let's get the rest of the... Accuracy out of the way.
[299:29.82]Try to get, like, 220, 240...
[299:33.94]And then power, power.
[299:35.90]And we'll take a look after that.
[299:37.76]You, on the other hand, you're doing book, book.
[299:39.96]Rest, yeah.
[299:40.72]Intelligence.
[299:41.98]Tub, tub.
[299:43.50]Rest.
[299:44.18]Alright.
[299:45.24]Okay.
[299:46.38]Sounds good.
[299:49.04]Hydrate.
[299:49.52]I'm drinking right now.
[299:54.76]I'm currently consuming a beverage right this second.
[300:01.09]You're fine.
[300:02.43]You're fine.
[300:04.59]You're okay.
[300:08.39]Here.
[300:08.61]Have a carrot.
[300:11.95]Is it water?
[300:12.64]It is the... It is the Coca-Cola that I've been drinking for the last two hours.
[300:19.40]And on my last break, not the one you just... where I just peed, but the one, like, from two hours ago, I did drink a full glass of water before I came back up here.
[300:28.74]So, I'm good.
[300:36.91]He's lying?
[300:37.53]No, that's not a lie.
[300:39.41]That's for real.
[300:46.66]Everybody's working today.
[300:49.08]There we go.
[300:49.60]Two more accuracy.
[300:52.92]We should be good to go with accuracy until probably rank like A, I would assume.
[300:57.54]Let's give you some food.
[300:59.96]Good job, first of all.
[301:10.54]And... carry.
[301:18.77]Please die already, Roberto.
[301:21.03]Why are you saying that?
[301:25.11]Really?
[301:28.35]Ban that guy.
[301:40.91]A dragon that eats carrots.
[301:43.59]I need to get meat.
[302:00.36]Almost there to do, potentially, the official cup, but just to go get the junk.
[302:04.67]I'm sure everybody has something to do today, yeah.
[302:08.77]No, you don't even need to rest.
[302:11.58]Back to the book.
[302:14.39]Then rest.
[302:18.33]You... No, don't rest.
[302:20.67]You're fine.
[302:21.25]Target.
[302:21.43]Target, target.
[302:21.99]You... Just do sandbag.
[302:23.31]Sandbag, sandbag.
[302:27.72]Rest.
[302:42.73]Pretty good.
[302:45.85]Hey, that's not bad.
[302:46.57]It's pretty good.
[302:47.97]It's pretty good.
[302:48.75]Pretty good.
[302:50.51]Pretty good.
[302:56.21]Alright, you now need to rest.
[303:01.24]I swear, these little flower guys eat more than anybody else.
[303:08.60]The mushrooms and the flowers eat way more.
[303:11.88]You eat more food than the dragon does.
[303:14.50]How?
[303:18.98]Makes no sense.
[303:19.72]Alright, now everybody seems to be... This is a day of rest.
[303:30.11]Rest.
[303:30.71]Rest.
[303:31.89]Rest.
[303:32.17]Rest.
[303:44.23]Anybody feeling down?
[303:45.59]Everybody good?
[303:48.89]Lively.
[303:49.51]Let's... give you something to eat, too.
[303:55.43]A mango this time.
[303:56.20]This is like a little snack.
[304:03.89]Okay, you're good.
[304:04.55]Lively.
[304:05.85]Lively.
[304:08.05]And you're all good.
[304:10.01]A little bit more training.
[304:25.08]So, let's get you into the accuracy rate.
[304:30.76]But I want to do one more.
[304:33.57]Let's get you into the book again.
[304:34.87]And then you into the lifeblade.
[304:47.74]Pretty great gains.
[304:49.24]Roberto should be fine now for accuracy for a while.
[304:52.04]He's probably over 220, 230.
[305:08.09]And let's also... Good work.
[305:20.16]Okay.
[305:21.70]Everybody's alright.
[305:22.78]What have we got for competitions?
[305:27.25]Something's coming up, right?
[305:30.03]Yeah.
[305:30.41]A couple more weeks.
[305:31.39]Roberto has this.
[305:36.13]That'll give him enough to actually compete and bring him up to here, to B. So let's see, let's block out the weak here.
[305:55.14]So we got, let's do...
[305:59.65]sandbag and then maybe a rest here yeah I'd say sandbag and then rest he should be good to go and then we'll from there going forward we're going to do power and life or power and defense you need some more accuracy yes you do and health is fine for both of you good for it go
[306:28.98]Alright, you can relax now.
[306:34.26]What's with the gross plant?
[306:35.36]Get Vroomer back!
[306:40.30]I really hate to tell you this, but Vroomer is dead.
[306:52.95]I'm sorry.
[307:01.72]Here, have a potato.
[307:07.36]He liked it.
[307:09.20]No, he didn't like it.
[307:10.00]He was pissed off at that.
[307:11.61]Alright, you get a tournament tomorrow, so... It should have been you.
[307:28.34]It should have been you instead.
[307:30.02]Yeah, who's gonna raise them?
[307:33.16]Who's gonna play?
[307:35.18]I will.
[307:35.54]Me.
[307:36.02]Me.
[307:36.32]Me.
[307:36.56]I will.
[307:40.11]So this is today.
[307:44.47]Rest today.
[307:46.65]Target and... You can rest today too and then do life.
[307:59.69]Bad!
[308:02.45]Plus four only.
[308:03.63]What's up with that?
[308:05.10]Oh, you're tired.
[308:05.74]Alright.
[308:07.64]You're... Yeah.
[308:09.26]I'm sorry.
[308:11.10]But... Roberto is the last one I have to win.
[308:30.49]Don't feed your monsters potatoes.
[308:31.99]It's the worst food in the whole game, even if the monster likes it.
[308:36.88]Well, I actually haven't been.
[308:44.74]I truly have not been.
[308:46.23]I've been giving them mangoes and carrots and bananas.
[308:49.89]Alright.
[308:53.21]Shouldn't be too much of a problem.
[308:56.54]Everybody in C rank seems to be, just across the board, 180, 190.
[309:00.24]On every stat.
[309:05.82]We saw that weird monster with 482 intelligence that time.
[309:10.40]Made no sense.
[309:11.24]Alright, this guy.
[309:16.86]No.
[309:20.38]You're not.
[309:20.68]This is no good.
[309:21.90]I'll just bully you forever.
[309:28.43]I want to spray that flower with Roundup.
[309:31.73]Oh my god.
[309:34.40]Easy.
[309:39.28]He already is.
[309:39.74]He's already dead.
[309:43.58]How do you kill witch that is already dead?
[309:46.39]High power.
[309:51.83]With fire.
[310:08.13]Mmm, that's not a good start.
[310:09.83]Look at that damage.
[310:15.74]Look at that damage!
[310:18.64]He's unstoppable.
[310:21.68]Unbeatable.
[310:23.36]Immutable.
[310:24.84]Unbelievable.
[310:26.46]Irreplaceable.
[310:28.04]Irredeemable.
[310:30.44]Undeniable.
[310:36.64]This is versus Kush.
[310:44.64]Ooh.
[310:44.84]332 with insane accuracy.
[310:48.59]Well, just kill it fast.
[311:02.96]Kill it fast.
[311:06.90]It was pathetic.
[311:09.64]Uh-oh.
[311:14.89]That's... not good.
[311:25.15]Again, quick.
[311:28.01]Thank god.
[311:32.31]That, yeah, nice game mechanic.
[311:34.89]That actually sucks.
[311:51.61]I can't fucking wait for Roberto to win again.
[311:54.29]Jesus Christ, that arrogant fuck thinks he's so fucking tough at picking on unprepared AIs.
[312:00.12]What a load of shit.
[312:01.14]What's the point of having a tourney if we know what the result will be?
[312:13.07]Alright, out of any coffee pasta, just coffee paste bullshit, my favorite, it really is the one about my mom bought me a laptop for my birthday and it's heating up my laptop and it's burning my legs.
[312:27.98]That's actually a funny thing.
[312:31.43]Coffee pasta's like, alright, here it comes.
[312:34.85]But that's actually kind of funny.
[312:45.58]I don't want- I don't want to have to get- No, isn't it like it- it's burning my legs, it hurts and shit?
[312:49.89]I thought that was- that's what it was.
[312:53.45]Yeah, that's- that's it.
[312:54.27]My leg's starting to- Someone has the right one.
[312:58.11]Alright, put it in emote only.
[313:06.64]I fucked it all up.
[313:08.92]That was my fault.
[313:10.26]I'm like encouraging spam.
[313:12.26]Emote only for like five minutes.
[313:20.10]Target training.
[313:21.20]Rest.
[313:21.80]Yeah, you're tired.
[313:23.34]Lifeblade.
[313:24.10]Target.
[313:25.20]No, I don't think I need this anymore.
[313:27.81]Let me get a good look.
[313:32.03]342 power.
[313:34.19]I'm gonna say life.
[313:35.77]Speed is so bad.
[313:37.93]Life and defense, maybe, or just life.
[313:39.69]Just stack health.
[313:41.33]Get it over 200.
[313:46.32]And then you can rest here.
[313:55.39]You rest.
[313:56.05]You hate me right now.
[314:00.05]Yeah, get in the tub.
[314:04.97]Pretty good health increase.
[314:13.50]Sick.
[314:15.69]Let's get that over 200.
[314:16.25]Fish!
[314:18.59]There we go.
[314:21.14]Eat this.
[314:22.36]You deserve it.
[314:22.88]You earned it.
[314:23.24]You okay?
[314:32.65]What about the dinosaur?
[314:35.11]How you doing?
[314:36.09]You doing good?
[314:47.33]Okay, proceed.
[314:53.02]I think it's time now to try to find that junk because Roberto's ready.
[315:05.77]How tired is everybody?
[315:07.75]Maybe I'll wait.
[315:10.33]I'll wait till like the next day.
[315:18.99]Hello, how are things?
[315:19.83]Need anything today?
[315:20.55]Go ahead, take a look around.
[315:24.01]Not really.
[315:25.03]Unless you have something new.
[315:27.37]Do you have anything new?
[315:29.83]No.
[315:30.43]I get the same shit.
[315:32.43]What about... I have those stones, right?
[315:34.75]No.
[315:36.09]Well, see you later.
[315:47.89]Uh, everyone's alright.
[315:50.83]Yeah, it's time.
[315:51.83]Maybe you should rest and then we'll go.
[315:55.02]Because I want to be able to make sure I steamroll it.
[315:59.06]Yeah, rest today.
[316:02.00]Open the book, open the tub, and they'll be okay.
[316:03.96]It doesn't matter anyways.
[316:05.26]Then I can feed everybody and go on the adventure.
[316:11.11]Good increase.
[316:14.78]I played a lot of Monster Rancher 2 when I was 10, but then one of my monsters died of old age and I cried and I quit playing forever.
[316:26.32]That's sad.
[316:27.33]But, you know, life is a circle, you know?
[316:45.19]You have some mango.
[317:00.01]Everyone's good.
[317:01.91]Let's find the junk in the jungle now.
[317:05.23]Let's bring everybody, let's just farm experience for these two.
[317:07.49]Start exploring.
[317:21.28]So I didn't do this last time somehow.
[317:23.16]I found the end, but I need to find the junk.
[317:28.68]I guess.
[317:40.95]Time is cubic.
[317:42.39]No.
[317:43.67]Time is a circle.
[317:56.61]The Earth is a circle.
[318:01.09]The snake eating itself.
[318:05.90]The Ouroboros is a circle.
[318:11.72]Pizza is a circle.
[318:17.29]Your brain is a circle.
[318:19.95]Your head is a circle.
[318:29.03]The pills I just took.
[318:31.49]That make me think this strangely.
[318:34.51]Shaped like a circle.
[318:39.27]Everything's a circle, man.
[318:53.37]The casino chips.
[318:55.49]They're a circle.
[318:56.98]The Earth is a circle, the Moon is a circle, the Sun is a circle!
[319:08.10]87% chance to hit now.
[319:12.85]That thing's amazing.
[319:14.41]That's fine.
[319:25.34]Don't do drugs.
[319:25.96]It's fucking bad for you.
[319:26.96]Don't be crazy.
[319:27.66]Don't be an idiot.
[319:42.19]Tylenol.
[319:42.45]Okay, I'm going to list you the drugs that are okay.
[319:44.45]Tylenol.
[320:07.24]That's all of them.
[320:21.53]Level 11, what do I get?
[320:24.14]Genius!
[320:26.48]He's now a genius.
[320:30.14]Just when you thought Roberto couldn't get any better.
[320:34.49]Genius.
[320:35.81]Increases intelligence attacks, but strength attacks damage easily.
[320:41.67]What?
[320:43.24]Can I turn this off?
[320:49.62]I don't know.
[320:50.06]What does this mean?
[320:52.12]But strength attacks damage easily.
[320:58.77]I get hurt more by strength.
[321:00.83]That's terrible.
[321:10.37]Oh, somebody can dig, right?
[321:12.83]Who can dig straight down?
[321:13.92]Unprover, right?
[321:18.46]I think so.
[321:24.60]Investigate it.
[321:30.66]Unprover couldn't find anything.
[321:35.95]What good are you gonna gift me here, man?
[321:38.63]Come on.
[322:02.58]This game looks like a fake game that an extra would be playing in a movie.
[322:18.00]Spiroid obtained big lung.
[322:20.02]I got toy glasses.
[322:33.90]It's very funny.
[322:35.18]Is it a trait?
[322:41.15]Big Lung increases power of moves that expel breath.
[322:45.17]So fire.
[322:45.83]A fake game that the extra is playing in the movie somewhere in the background.
[323:16.99]You don't even get a chance.
[323:18.49]Sit down.
[323:23.92]Jerma subs?
[323:28.68]You are her Jerma sub.
[323:37.06]Alright, junk.
[323:48.31]Junk.
[323:49.21]Yes.
[323:50.31]Obtained Junk Toy.
[323:51.63]That's it, right?
[323:53.47]That's what he wanted.
[323:56.57]Is Jerma subbed to Jerma?
[323:57.65]Yes.
[323:58.15]But Jerma is subbed to Jerma because Jerma is... Jerma IS Jerma.
[324:03.04]So therefore he just gets a badge next to their name.
[324:06.54]I thought that was a monster.
[324:15.91]I just get a sub to my own channel.
[324:18.41]But it's not... I don't have to pay for it.
[324:20.37]It's just there.
[324:21.03]I didn't do anything.
[324:23.03]I just have it.
[324:28.65]Wait, is there something over here that I just walked by?
[324:32.37]No.
[324:39.28]Imagine subbing to Jerma.
[324:40.74]See?
[324:41.52]To that, the person just said that.
[324:43.14]And they're not subscribed, so they can say that.
[324:47.75]I mean, it's rude.
[324:49.73]Exceptionally rude.
[324:50.93]But we're not going to talk about that.
[325:04.65]We're just talking about facts.
[325:16.14]I don't know him.
[325:23.56]The toy is not the junk that I need.
[325:27.71]Did you wave your hands and fingers across while you said that in a kind British accent?
[325:34.97]And were there twinkle sounds made and my eyes kind of glazed over?
[325:39.35]That is what I'm looking for.
[326:00.93]Where is this thing?
[326:12.02]Star Wars is too old?
[326:12.90]Kids don't get that reference, do they?
[326:14.34]What?
[326:15.60]One just came out like a year ago.
[326:16.84]That was the biggest hit. 334.
[326:33.29]Alright, unprover leveled up.
[326:42.81]Flower dance.
[326:44.83]Didn't... Oh, no, that was the mushroom.
[326:48.30]Why are mushrooms just flowers in this game?
[326:49.96]I don't have the bunny anymore, do I?
[326:56.08]No.
[326:57.84]We iced the bunny.
[327:04.11]Apparently you can't cut through this with your sword, somehow.
[327:17.68]Digimon World?
[327:18.58]I don't even know what that is.
[327:22.98]Digimon World.
[327:34.21]Is that, like, an MMO?
[327:35.07]Is it a massive multiplayer game or something?
[327:50.58]Does this shit even exist in this game?
[327:54.66]Please have this be it.
[327:57.84]That's a Document 10, goddammit.
[328:03.72]It's a PlayStation 1 game.
[328:09.53]It's like this, but you explore a world with your Monster Rancher friend.
[328:14.55]I can't progress anymore.
[328:15.55]I have to go all the way around.
[328:33.30]It's one of my favorite games.
[328:34.50]I'll check it out.
[328:35.23]Am I looking for the mushrooms?
[328:39.77]No, I'm looking for the specific junk this guy wants so I can participate in the sea tournament.
[329:03.05]Digimon World is amazing.
[329:04.93]But you hatch eggs, it's like this, and you get to watch your monsters poop everywhere.
[329:08.32]I love how that's a selling point.
[329:22.33]That's perfect for you.
[329:27.99]You definitely won't check it out, by the way.
[329:31.61]Well, why wouldn't I?
[329:37.22]Just because I check it out doesn't mean I'm going to play it.
[329:39.70]I'm going to check it out.
[329:42.34]That means I'm going to open up a tab, type in Digimon World, watch like a trailer, look up reviews, and then decide, you know what?
[329:55.32]That sounds good.
[330:02.81]This feels so good when you insta-kill.
[330:14.35]The fart streamer is judging a poop game.
[330:17.59]We already talked about that, why that wasn't the reason why I thought that was so funny.
[330:23.45]You're putting words in my ears.
[330:40.15]That is fine.
[330:49.49]Yes, words in my ears.
[330:53.11]You are currently putting words into my ears, and I do not like them.
[330:56.51]I don't like hearing them.
[330:59.76]Great wing.
[331:01.62]Probably a trait.
[331:10.05]Great wing.
[331:11.81]Power moves that use the wings.
[331:23.70]You guys don't have the Twitch integration?
[331:26.32]Better twitch.tv?
[331:28.59]Notification sound thing?
[331:30.17]Where every time a line of chat comes... Yeah, I can hear you guys.
[331:34.93]Close.
[331:39.09]I want to make sure I know when a chat message comes through.
[331:46.43]Every time, yeah?
[331:53.50]Almost level 6 for Unprover.
[332:04.21]I really don't know what this is.
[332:07.79]causing me anguish.
[332:11.95]Yeah, I get an email every time there's a chat message.
[332:16.25]Twitch sends me a notification.
[332:27.55]It's hard though, I mean, I'd like to know exactly when in the time the date stamped when I get a chat message in my chat room.
[332:36.11]But it can be hard because, you know, my bank statements are on that same email, so... Credit card, it's all there, so... I have to, like, skim through.
[332:44.79]Like, once every couple months when I'm really trying to see, like, bank info.
[332:50.41]I have to sift through, like, 800,000 to 900,000 emails.
[332:52.09]Unprover Mastered Helicopter.
[333:16.14]Somebody said, you know you can just search emails.
[333:19.22]What does a search box mean?
[333:23.06]I don't have one.
[333:23.74]I just killed a fucking new enemy.
[333:25.12]I didn't even see what it was because I've been one-hitting everything.
[333:30.39]I don't even know what that monster was.
[333:36.93]Goldenfoot and Flutter.
[333:43.97]Can I walk forward five feet without this happening?
[333:55.82]I mean, I guess it's farming experience.
[333:59.86]Everyone write messages with the word BANK so he can't find them.
[334:15.71]If only that were real.
[334:18.49]Bank.
[334:18.83]Yeah, I'll just search the word bank and I'll find it.
[334:23.26]Search result turned up.
[334:24.26]41,000 entries.
[334:25.98]The place to dig.
[334:43.61]You suck, Unprover.
[334:45.87]Two in a row.
[334:48.16]Important info, please open.
[335:05.26]Give me... the junk.
[335:12.51]Oh, come on.
[335:13.19]Can I even do this?
[335:17.94]Is this something I can physically do?
[335:21.29]All the way down.
[335:45.33]Is that a timer?
[335:47.13]It's an energy meter.
[335:49.03]I have to get out of here before they get sizzling.
[335:51.87]We're really remotely close to it.
[336:00.30]I can help you out with your emails.
[336:02.14]Just give me the password and the email.
[336:03.48]Okay.
[336:05.12]I appreciate that.
[336:05.80]Really?
[336:06.02]You'll help me?
[336:06.62]That's really thoughtful of you.
[336:11.72]Do you need anything else?
[336:14.62]Is that all you need?
[336:17.91]There it is.
[336:18.45]Jungler D. It's like a Velociraptor face.
[336:24.77]But... A Petey Piranha as well.
[336:38.76]Fire Lore for Roberto.
[336:41.26]Gust.
[336:42.90]I'm getting a lot of... Um...
[336:48.24]Intelligence moves for Roberto now.
[336:49.86]I want your Neopets account.
[337:05.53]Are any of those worth any money?
[337:19.57]There ain't much left.
[337:24.27]Is there a Neopet that this many years later is actually worth more than a couple hundred bucks?
[337:39.21]Hey, this is Citibank.
[337:40.28]Just wanted to let you know that we lost your money.
[337:42.56]What?
[337:45.18]What the fuck are you talking- What do you mean?
[337:48.50]Citibank.
[337:53.97]How's my money gone?
[337:55.27]What the fuck?
[337:57.94]I gotta look into this.
[337:59.98]So that Citibank just like gave me a notification right here.
[338:11.44]It was in chat.
[338:12.06]I don't understand.
[338:13.90]That's weird that it would come up in Twitch chat.
[338:15.82]It had like a username too.
[338:16.98]It was weird.
[338:17.42]Let me just check.
[338:31.81]Nah, my money's still in it.
[338:36.26]Let me just make sure that the ball... I have two accounts in the city bank, let's see.
[338:38.76]I have $11 in my... $4 in that savings account.
[338:41.06]Alright.
[338:41.78]No, that's good.
[338:42.60]I'm out.
[339:08.44]No, it's... maybe it did get wiped out.
[339:12.97]What are you spending all your money on?
[339:27.53]Where is this stupid item?
[339:34.25]Why is this part of the game gated?
[339:37.85]I just want to take him to a tournament.
[339:49.43]Alright, third time's the charm.
[339:50.44]This is your last chance.
[339:52.66]If you don't get this, I'm actually going to freeze you.
[339:55.62]Nice knowing you.
[340:22.91]$50,000 has been transferred to Ster.
[340:25.17]You did not complete this transaction.
[340:26.75]Please contact Citibank customer service.
[340:29.67]Oh, no, that's real.
[340:30.29]That's weird that it's in Twitch chat, but it's real.
[340:34.45]Uh, okay.
[340:36.29]I don't know why that's weird that that pops up here, though.
[340:47.50]Keen Fang.
[340:49.58]Trample.
[340:52.00]Machine gun.
[340:57.58]Machine gun.
[340:58.96]Let me see what that looks like.
[341:01.62]So, let's see.
[341:05.81]Machine gun.
[341:07.15]Critical hit rate is A. Alright, maybe I'm not gonna push you into the Fry Lady yet.
[341:11.87]Alright, machine gun is long range, so... Takes 40 guts to do that.
[341:19.25]Accuracy's terrible.
[341:23.86]Just the dance.
[341:24.54]Flower dance.
[341:25.22]It's a charm.
[341:26.62]Alright, well.
[341:34.59]Let's, uh... We got Dirt Search already.
[341:37.79]King Fang.
[341:38.81]Of course, that's what it means.
[341:41.47]Uh, you got something new, too.
[341:42.29]You got Trample.
[341:47.46]This is really good.
[341:49.48]Tons of guts damage.
[341:51.60]Massive crit rating.
[341:53.28]Tons of damage.
[341:54.24]Actual to health and not terrible accuracy.
[341:57.10]Takes 34 guts to do.
[341:58.18]Is it long range?
[342:02.99]Flutter is a super accurate move.
[342:09.19]I'm not sure if it's going to be a status effect.
[342:12.96]We also have detail.
[342:14.03]Trample.
[342:17.49]Detail.
[342:18.07]I guess I could put it on the last row.
[342:26.02]Flutter is a slow.
[342:26.95]That's cool.
[342:49.41]What's the best breakfast food?
[343:00.26]Whoa, this is a new animal.
[343:07.30]You got Jigglypuff'd.
[343:18.85]And we stole all your money.
[343:20.45]Well, that would be impossible considering I don't have any money.
[343:25.10]Every set that I make, I buy gold bars.
[343:29.18]And I scrape the gold into small baggies.
[343:32.82]You just take a knife and you scrape, scrape, scrape filings off into Ziploc bags.
[343:37.86]And I've stored them all over the world.
[343:41.75]Only I know where they are.
[343:42.65]They're everywhere.
[343:55.31]In fact, I've done it so many times that I had originally a treasure map that I was going to leave.
[344:02.41]But over time, I did it so often that the map got so confusing that I don't even know where they are.
[344:10.94]There was circles and X's and I had a globe and it's been done eight, nine thousand, twelve hundred times.
[344:19.68]I only know where two of them are.
[344:21.72]And one of them's under my bed.
[344:25.22]But it's only, like, $4 worth of gold.
[344:30.44]The other one is under a tree.
[344:35.06]I buried it under a tree.
[344:37.72]And it sucks because this is, like, probably 15... It's probably 15 bucks worth of gold under that tree.
[344:42.79]But I... I know I could bring it to, like, the general area of the general forest of what tree it was.
[344:48.83]But I couldn't point at which one it was.
[344:51.19]I was wicked fucked up.
[344:55.77]For some reason, like, I ubered here.
[344:59.85]I just ubered to the forest.
[345:16.35]Nice story, now shut up and keep playing.
[345:18.15]Hey, you shut up and keep playing!
[345:31.94]We got a boss coming in.
[345:37.06]Okay, fine.
[345:37.86]Pass the controller.
[345:38.71]Here, take it!
[345:39.35]Let me talk about my gold filings while you beat the boss in one hit.
[345:46.05]This is a lot of help.
[345:53.72]Oh fuck, I'm gonna die.
[345:54.54]No, we're good.
[346:05.05]His baby Groot.
[346:12.98]Hey, shut up, dude.
[346:13.78]You shut up!
[346:17.92]Employing the use of 8th grade at the lunch table insults.
[346:22.70]That's how you know it's going real well.
[346:28.13]Stray monster left something behind.
[346:29.37]Is it gonna be the junk?
[346:37.03]Yes, it is.
[346:46.64]Wonder what it is.
[346:47.46]Well, whatever.
[346:48.02]Let's hurry and take this to the Monster Association.
[346:51.28]Okay, we're finally gonna get our license.
[346:58.30]Took long enough.
[347:19.66]Alright.
[347:24.47]Let me save the game.
[347:29.29]That took over 30 minutes.
[347:30.30]It took longer than that!
[347:35.06]We got a game wall put in front of us to go walk around in circles to find this junk.
[347:49.27]I think now I can get this done.
[347:51.77]Let me see.
[347:58.15]Anybody tired?
[347:58.95]You are.
[347:59.91]You rest.
[348:01.71]You rest too.
[348:03.88]You can do target.
[348:04.70]No!
[348:05.10]You do something else.
[348:06.88]Life, maybe.
[348:07.58]I don't need any more accuracy.
[348:09.78]It's perfect.
[348:17.90]That's better.
[348:27.32]Are you hungry?
[348:27.88]Anyone hungry?
[348:29.92]Not particularly.
[348:30.62]Alright, let's go to the town.
[348:39.38]See if I can actually do this.
[348:47.63]Association.
[348:51.21]And?
[348:53.09]Oh, are you Fane, who I've been hearing about, and is that little Rio?
[348:57.11]Oh, the explorer we met in the cave.
[348:58.55]Could you be Mr. Kernab by any chance?
[349:01.94]Oh my, so it was you!
[349:03.58]Well, with that aside, let's see what you've got for me.
[349:06.76]You've done an excellent job, like true master explorers.
[349:11.48]Well, thank you, but what we really need is a breeder's license.
[349:15.29]Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, that's right.
[349:16.67]But I must have you take a little test first.
[349:18.41]Oh my god.
[349:21.52]Come on out.
[349:22.12]Yes, what is it?
[349:25.10]Yes, uh, what I called you here for is, could you please fight Fain?
[349:31.98]Why is he so red?
[349:34.86]If he can beat the best young star, then nobody can argue that he doesn't deserve a license.
[349:39.64]He wants me and her to fight.
[349:43.80]An all-or-nothing single match with Filia.
[349:49.30]You want me to fight her?
[349:51.25]Hardly seems like a little test, but I accept the challenge.
[349:56.35]Yes, okay.
[349:57.07]Show me what you got, Fain.
[350:09.58]This is gonna be easy.
[350:14.47]I'll take the license now, please.
[350:15.47]Thank you.
[350:22.33]Can I have it now?
[350:24.15]Or is there going to be a fourth test or quest I have to go on before I can continue to play the game?
[350:32.73]Now there's no question, I present you with a license and rank C breeder status.
[350:38.09]From this day, you are an official FIMBA breeder.
[350:40.15]Congrats, now you can enter the real competition.
[350:42.95]Yes, I can.
[350:43.57]Thanks, Rio.
[350:44.07]Now I can enter the same competition as Graham and Philia.
[350:47.40]Philia?
[350:49.98]Ever since Fane left school for such a reason, I never, never thought I'd have a chance to fight you again.
[350:56.49]I'm so glad.
[350:57.39]Delia, thank you.
[350:59.19]Next we meet in the official competition, where I will one-hit kill you monster again.
[351:03.35]And this time it'll be even more embarrassing, because there aren't going to be three people watching.
[351:06.77]There's going to be 300,000 people watching.
[351:07.87]Good luck.
[351:17.38]Why was I kicked out of school?
[351:18.96]I wonder if Philia knows the reason.
[351:28.02]Alright.
[351:30.01]Let's enter that tournament with Roberto.
[351:42.53]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[351:47.85]Hello there, Finn.
[351:48.43]Congratulations.
[351:49.05]I heard you earned your breeder certification.
[351:52.37]Thanks.
[351:52.73]It wouldn't have happened without you, Caesar.
[351:55.51]I didn't do much.
[351:56.27]You earned this by your own accord.
[351:57.69]I just provided an opportunity for you.
[352:00.25]Well, now that you're an official breeder, I'll be sure to ask for your help.
[352:05.39]And you too, Rita.
[352:07.14]Yes, Father.
[352:08.80]With that in mind, I figure it's about time you expanded the ranch a bit.
[352:12.68]Told you to come by next week.
[352:15.81]Coming by again, expanding.
[352:18.10]Can't wait till next week.
[352:20.42]So we're gonna get a bigger range.
[352:26.90]Breed chat members.
[352:29.11]What the fuck?
[352:30.75]We can now enter the competition.
[352:31.89]Why did I read that?
[352:36.57]It was weird.
[352:37.87]Alright.
[352:40.01]Let's see.
[352:43.20]When is the official competition?
[352:45.95]coming up, right?
[352:48.27]I don't need to do this one.
[352:49.19]I already did it.
[352:49.83]So we're gonna... This is $4,000 a cake.
[352:54.84]I think we'll be ready.
[352:55.74]Let's get some more life.
[352:57.00]Life twice, rest, and then maybe... Let's see.
[353:06.12]342 power, which is unmatched.
[353:09.21]Probably need a little bit more life and maybe some more defense.
[353:14.07]Yeah, I need more defense because I just got that stupid trait that makes me take more damage from power attacks, so... Defense and life.
[353:26.38]Let's just do life now.
[353:31.88]Life, rest.
[353:33.21]Life, defense.
[353:40.79]And then probably defense... probably rest.
[353:43.07]Well, let's see.
[353:43.61]This might be a little too much.
[353:46.99]Target.
[353:48.15]And then that's fine.
[353:49.49]Book.
[353:49.81]And then we'll just see what it looks like.
[354:04.48]I feel like I have some speed, otherwise a CC train's gonna hit you hard, yeah?
[354:09.53]That's true.
[354:10.59]What is the speed?
[354:11.29]The speed is pretty bad, isn't it?
[354:12.79]I need more food, too.
[354:20.31]I will get that after the end of today.
[354:38.77]Do I have any more food that you can eat?
[354:40.27]Um, six mangoes, so I got a little bit.
[354:52.10]You're fine, you're fine.
[354:53.26]You also need a mango.
[354:55.70]No, wrong person.
[354:58.38]Come here.
[355:00.52]I feel like very slowly, without paying attention, he's getting really, really, really insane stats.
[355:04.82]Let me look.
[355:14.76]It's coming along.
[355:15.40]200 intelligence.
[355:19.88]I need way more health and accuracy though.
[355:22.70]The ac- okay.
[355:23.74]That might look bad.
[355:26.29]At first glance here, but remember the accuracy was below 60 or something.
[355:30.31]It was horrible.
[355:40.72]He looks pretty good, too.
[355:43.00]High intelligence.
[355:43.94]I wish I could just skip tournaments.
[355:45.36]Because these guys have to fight down at the E rank.
[355:54.26]But maybe not.
[355:54.86]Maybe I'll just keep them for exploring.
[355:56.36]And just not even have him just be the tournament one.
[356:03.08]Because it almost feels like that's too much to do.
[356:15.71]They've gone for like three hours.
[356:16.63]How's Roberto?
[356:17.35]He's been pretty good.
[356:17.89]So you actually sell meat.
[356:27.66]It's very expensive, but you still sell it.
[356:30.36]Beef.
[356:30.64]500.
[356:31.08]That's so much.
[356:33.00]Squid.
[356:33.72]Let's get a bunch of these.
[356:39.66]Did I say that correctly?
[356:41.24]Eating screws.
[356:46.53]Why would I feed screws to my animals?
[356:52.03]That seems kind of insane.
[356:54.85]I'm gonna buy a couple of beefs just for the purpose of making sure people are taken care of.
[357:00.82]Let's get some more bananas.
[357:01.98]Okay.
[357:02.28]Feed it to the robot.
[357:15.12]Should I feed the robot a screw?
[357:24.63]Robots don't eat screws.
[357:27.25]They might.
[357:27.65]Okay.
[357:37.28]Here I am again.
[357:40.41]Long time no see, and fain how'd you manage to make so much progress in such a short while?
[357:44.86]That's a very loud laugh.
[357:48.06]I'm nothing compared to you, you!
[357:49.60]Heh.
[357:52.98]You've even got the talk down, buddy.
[357:55.50]Well then, we're going to get this done in a jiffy just like last time.
[357:58.45]We're doing this in one week.
[358:00.19]Alright, boys!
[358:02.59]Thank you, you.
[358:13.71]So that gives us another session here.
[358:19.23]We can do this one more time and then rest here.
[358:21.21]So let's do lifeblade again.
[358:24.89]Rest and then tongue.
[358:27.90]You need to... Let's do book again.
[358:31.64]No, let's do target.
[358:33.98]Target, book, and then rest.
[358:35.50]You need to do... Book.
[358:44.98]And we'll probably rest.
[358:47.60]Alright, Roberto is probably gonna just... I'm gonna do speed now.
[358:58.40]I gotta put the trampoline back here though.
[358:59.94]That's what speed is.
[359:00.80]He's tired now.
[359:14.92]What disk did that dragon come from?
[359:16.46]It came from Jackass the Video Game for PlayStation 2.
[359:21.14]Alright, relax now.
[359:39.06]This should be the end of the week.
[359:40.14]Let's see what happens.
[359:50.85]That just about wraps things up.
[359:52.53]What do you think?
[359:53.05]Does this suit your tastes?
[359:55.59]View is really nice.
[359:57.91]Okay, next is the house and hut.
[359:59.39]Like before, tell me where you want me to put them.
[360:03.61]I gotta pick a yard now.
[360:04.71]Uh, back here.
[360:05.79]Great house.
[360:06.23]Okay.
[360:07.57]And then a great hut.
[360:23.13]Nice.
[360:25.71]No, no, no.
[360:26.21]Okay, I gotta put some more shit here.
[360:28.59]I'm gonna put... I have a sandbag already out here.
[360:31.13]I need the trampoline.
[360:31.91]Let's move some of this stuff out of the way.
[360:37.33]Let's get this over here.
[360:38.21]There's the tub.
[360:38.95]There's the life blade.
[360:41.33]All the ones that are small go in the same spot.
[360:45.15]Here, you turn this way.
[360:46.47]We want a single, right?
[360:48.61]Which one of these is a single?
[360:49.79]This is.
[360:57.64]And this.
[360:59.42]And that.
[360:59.86]Something else can go here.
[361:01.86]Sandbag book target.
[361:04.72]What am I missing?
[361:06.55]That's it, right?
[361:07.21]Yeah, that's everything.
[361:09.07]Alright.
[361:26.68]five monsters can live in the hut oh god five more Jesus or a five total this is gonna get overwhelming here alright rest tub right when is the official tournament next week
[362:00.83]Is everybody tired right now?
[362:01.83]I think they are.
[362:04.85]Rest for everybody.
[362:07.05]Rest, rest, rest.
[362:09.50]And we'll take a look tomorrow.
[362:11.10]See if I can pull him out of this and get to B rank.
[362:14.48]Before the stream comes to a close here.
[362:18.84]Six hours into this.
[362:21.23]And hopefully I can get him.
[362:23.55]I'm gonna do speed.
[362:31.22]So many managements.
[362:32.24]Good luck feeding all of them.
[362:33.48]Yeah.
[362:33.76]I always wish I could hire somebody to come feed them and do... You know what I mean?
[362:37.10]I wish I could have somebody feed them.
[362:38.50]No, don't give him beef.
[362:42.22]He's not hungry.
[362:43.92]He's hungry enough for like a mango.
[362:54.14]I feel like I'm going to accidentally neglect at least two or three of the monsters that are here.
[362:58.36]I'm already having trouble dealing with these two or three.
[363:06.89]Here, have a squid.
[363:12.99]Disk time before I call it?
[363:14.15]Yeah.
[363:17.20]After I do this next tournament, we'll see if we can get something else.
[363:19.42]That means I would have unlocked another set of monsters, right?
[363:22.44]Getting to B rank.
[363:23.12]Alright, let's go.
[363:36.33]Well, I have to get to B rank.
[363:39.13]That's another thing.
[363:44.21]Tub, he's not... He'll be fine.
[363:53.54]Nice.
[363:54.00]Okay.
[363:55.64]Decent defense now.
[364:02.51]He's doing okay.
[364:03.15]Let's praise him and then... Go win...
[364:10.58]Imagine having to make five individual training schedules and make sure all your monsters participate in tournaments.
[364:18.46]That's a little too much.
[364:30.05]Thanks for the stream.
[364:30.77]Thanks for watching.
[364:32.23]No problem.
[364:35.71]Okay, Weekend Eye.
[364:36.91]Oh, no, no, no, not yet.
[364:38.17]Yeah, you're fine.
[364:39.11]Alright, C cup.
[364:44.17]Official C cup moving on to nearly the end of the cups here.
[364:50.89]Almost going to be in B. Then there's A. And the final one is S. The fight that is your key to success.
[365:07.43]Roberto versus Ropez.
[365:13.30]Pretty strong intelligence, but not even close to matching my sheer, just absolute dominating skill.
[365:21.38]Hope my advice wasn't annoying.
[365:25.18]No, not at all.
[365:27.52]These games are really strange and they have a lot of weird particular things, so that's fine.
[365:36.40]I'm just kidding around when I go back and forth about, you know, saying random things about the game and... I'm just messing around.
[365:45.76]I don't think I said anything then, but hopefully you don't feel that way.
[365:52.02]Here we go.
[365:54.10]You know how it's gonna end.
[365:57.61]Good start.
[365:58.05]You wanna back it up?
[366:03.11]Fine.
[366:03.41]Air shot.
[366:09.40]I'll take it.
[366:17.95]I can't wait for him to win again.
[366:21.33]Dodongo versus Sherry.
[366:26.41]Bundy versus Alaman.
[366:32.76]Dodongo versus Ropez.
[366:35.46]Ropez, looks like you're not going to win this.
[366:38.16]Alright, Sherry.
[366:39.32]Here we go.
[366:43.41]Sherry is pretty scary.
[366:47.55]My intelligence is so low.
[366:50.79]And Smoke Bomb, Crescent, Lightning, Meteor.
[366:55.58]I cannot get hit by one of those.
[366:56.94]I'll die in one hit.
[367:16.75]Again, quick.
[367:20.61]Uh-oh.
[367:21.87]Thank god.
[367:22.37]You just gotta go in.
[367:28.26]You gotta do the front flip move into the slash.
[367:30.36]Okay, Roberto versus Alleman.
[367:46.66]Not that scary, but is not going to miss.
[367:50.99]And will dodge a lot of shit.
[367:54.69]I'm not going to go in... With the typical guaranteed victory button.
[368:05.67]I need something that's going to hit.
[368:07.38]That's 55%.
[368:07.74]70%.
[368:07.76]There we go.
[368:08.16]I'm out of my way.
[368:12.42]No.
[368:13.02]Save.
[368:14.38]Guess that one right.
[368:19.00]Didn't get that one.
[368:19.84]That's a lot of damage.
[368:20.86]That's a lot of overkill, but I did it.
[368:25.02]Alright.
[368:47.66]Bundy and Dodongo are the ones to worry about.
[368:50.16]These are the ones that are winning, you know?
[368:52.48]Sherry wins.
[368:53.84]So Dodongo and Alamon, let's see.
[368:57.68]Dodongo is one of those huge rock monsters.
[369:00.99]That might be bad for me.
[369:01.93]Because all I have are power moves that are really any good.
[369:08.19]This is Bundy.
[369:14.15]Decent, but...
[369:16.87]High health.
[369:24.54]How does counter work?
[369:26.16]You can either press X, square, or circle to do a move.
[369:30.28]X is standard, square is power, and circle is, I believe, a better chance to hit, like lighter.
[369:37.16]So when they do a move, I have to just guess which one they're doing.
[369:40.90]There's no indicator of which it is.
[369:43.02]I have to just do a one out of three chance to get it.
[369:45.98]And if I miss it, then I get hit.
[369:49.78]But if I counter it, I actually, the move doesn't work and I hit them.
[369:56.26]That's not good.
[369:57.12]Bad start.
[370:00.23]Holy shit.
[370:08.41]That was a... Okay, I pressed square on that.
[370:10.39]That was a power move.
[370:13.65]So... Dodongo... Is the only thing... If Dodongo loses here to Bundy, then I automatically will win the tournament.
[370:25.46]That ain't gonna happen though.
[370:27.08]God damn it.
[370:35.56]Well, let's see.
[370:36.51]336 power, 355 health, 272 defense.
[370:41.81]Oh boy, this is gonna be bad.
[370:53.03]Low intelligence, but so do I. My intelligence moves aren't good enough to do.
[370:59.92]My speed is awful too.
[371:02.34]This guy's just a better version of me.
[371:03.92]I have to work.
[371:06.36]I'm gonna try to counter.
[371:09.18]Why you punks, you've come out of your hole, have you?
[371:11.44]I've been waiting for you.
[371:12.28]I couldn't beat you at school, but with my new Dodongo, I'm unbeatable.
[371:18.16]Besides, I want to impress Filius, so... I mean, no, forget what I just said.
[371:23.50]I won't pull any punches this time.
[371:26.74]He really is just me, but stronger.
[371:28.73]I have a little bit more power, but he's way more health.
[371:30.45]I have to rely on getting a good counter.
[371:39.17]Let's try it.
[371:39.69]Let's start.
[371:47.51]Like, maybe I can just ball him.
[371:53.53]Not good.
[371:55.90]Not good.
[371:56.68]Not good.
[372:02.04]Oh, boy.
[372:03.10]I have to hit him.
[372:03.64]Hit him with something.
[372:05.52]Oh, come on.
[372:08.46]Again.
[372:08.72]Hail Mary.
[372:09.34]Do it.
[372:10.36]Oh, again.
[372:12.45]Do it.
[372:16.81]Yes.
[372:19.52]God.
[372:22.86]See, I'm telling you, it's gonna be the big guys that do one single move that lands.
[372:35.79]B rank.
[372:36.27]4,000 gold and a cake.
[372:50.34]You are almost as famous as you can ever possibly be.
[373:04.97]He's an anime protagonist.
[373:06.29]That's not fair.
[373:06.85]He never loses.
[373:11.43]Congratulations on your victory.
[373:12.83]Nice fighting.
[373:14.65]Now, do you have a moment to speak with me?
[373:17.74]Sure.
[373:18.20]What is it?
[373:19.88]Your victory proves that you, too, are top-class breeders.
[373:24.14]And your search in the jungle has proved that you are excellent investigators.
[373:28.24]And so I have a very important favor that I'd like to ask of you.
[373:33.81]Sounds awfully important.
[373:36.15]Yes, well, we at FIMBA sent an investigation team out to the jungle, but they haven't returned.
[373:44.97]Are they lost?
[373:46.51]We don't know, but some breeders who have gone exploring have not come back as well.
[373:51.08]And so I wish to rely on you with your skills.
[373:53.28]Find out what's going on in there.
[373:55.54]Understood.
[373:57.90]Excellent.
[373:58.22]You're a great help.
[374:00.10]I'm just not going in there.
[374:06.24]You deserve a rest.
[374:09.36]Let's see here.
[374:10.60]B rank.
[374:13.00]Now it starts to get real.
[374:18.01]$5,000.
[374:18.11]Melons.
[374:20.21]Salmon.
[374:20.61]Alright, let's see.
[374:21.55]Let's try it.
[374:23.56]This is the real deal.
[374:24.54]This is the real game.
[374:26.84]No mistakes allowed up here.
[374:29.96]So Roberto's gonna try it.
[374:31.00]Let's save the game.
[374:50.46]So that last encounter was a little bit of a wake-up call that I need much more power and more defense.
[375:01.60]Because if I'm going to trade blows, then I better have at least 220-something plus.
[375:06.23]250 defense.
[375:06.59]Because at this point,
[375:21.78]He's got another probably year plus of life.
[375:27.80]And I think it's time that we get to like 450 power and actually just try to one-hit kill our way to the top.
[375:35.79]Because spreading out here to intelligence and speed and... I think we just have to do like 400 power.
[375:49.35]And just do the one-hit kill move.
[376:01.70]I'm going to get to 400 power.
[376:06.85]And see where I'm at after that.
[376:11.31]Sandbag.
[376:11.87]No, no, no.
[376:14.11]Rest.
[376:14.47]You just won a tournament.
[376:15.37]Sandbag.
[376:16.41]Let's see.
[376:17.05]Sandbag again.
[376:21.88]Put a rest in there.
[376:29.81]Target.
[376:30.31]That's fine.
[376:32.01]Uh, you can do... You can do... You can do speed.
[376:45.12]Nice.
[376:48.50]Can I get the new equipment yet?
[376:49.60]Uh, I think that guy has to show up.
[376:51.96]He shows up, like, once every, uh... Once every few months, right?
[376:54.80]Once a month?
[377:01.52]You need to eat too, don't you?
[377:03.78]No, you're fine.
[377:06.48]Did I save?
[377:07.04]Yeah, I saved.
[377:08.86]I got a save point.
[377:10.42]Here's a banana.
[377:20.53]Okay.
[377:29.41]I just want to see just how dangerous everybody is here.
[377:37.14]I can join.
[377:38.04]No, this is group battle?
[377:42.40]Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[377:48.15]Tag battle.
[377:52.07]I have to get somebody else.
[377:56.41]Leveled up.
[377:57.99]And ranked up.
[378:03.33]I can't just do it with... Can I enter this with one person?
[378:12.70]I really wish I didn't have to, because... I'll tell you, here's a complaint about Monster Ranch 4.
[378:20.88]At this point, do I really need to beat three of these to do an official tournament?
[378:25.12]Like, one of these?
[378:25.58]You know what I mean?
[378:27.97]Shouldn't I be able to just go to one of these?
[378:29.47]Like, I should be able to.
[378:30.77]I feel like that's added shit for no reason.
[378:35.01]Because I'm just going to go through here, because my stats are so high.
[378:39.35]I'm just going to wipe the floor with everybody here with the dragon.
[378:46.03]If you fuse Roberto, the fusion will keep its rank.
[378:50.37]That's actually really good to know.
[378:55.29]Well, it's not that I want to cheat with the wolf, I just... I really don't want to do three... cloth league tournaments to do the actual tournament.
[379:05.54]Alright, what do we got?
[379:08.26]Alright, let's get some training done.
[379:20.93]12 more power.
[379:22.37]Slowly climbing away over 400.
[379:23.99]Let's give you some more meat.
[379:33.02]And I got some squid here.
[379:34.56]What about the cake?
[379:37.10]From the finest bakery, it tastes as good as it looks.
[379:39.54]No, you get that to... That's a really special thing.
[379:41.96]Okay, have a squid.
[379:55.66]Good.
[379:58.23]Where's the other guy?
[380:03.65]Alright.
[380:03.85]Oh, he's hungry.
[380:10.46]Fusing a B tier with an E tier is probably not going to be as good as if you fused it with something else.
[380:25.75]So, this is kind of how the game works, I guess, is... So you get this guy up to, like, B rank.
[380:33.63]He's gonna die, right?
[380:35.31]So in another year, he's dead.
[380:37.60]Before he dies, you freeze him.
[380:41.76]And then you level up somebody else and get them to, like, C, B rank.
[380:47.26]Fuse them together.
[380:50.43]And then start that person over with insane stats and then they can just grind up to S rank.
[380:55.34]That's how it works, right?
[380:58.42]For the most part.
[380:59.10]But in this game they have to be friends.
[381:03.46]So how does that even work?
[381:07.91]Didn't somebody say that they have to be friends with each other?
[381:14.17]So can I freeze him and just keep him here?
[381:20.00]Let me take a look.
[381:23.03]Monster.
[381:23.55]Like, bonding, right?
[381:27.71]I mean, Roberto is really bonded with me.
[381:32.53]But how do I make him friends with somebody else?
[381:34.21]Do I have to, like, work together or something?
[381:41.78]Different data.
[381:44.00]School land.
[381:45.84]Fame.
[381:48.65]raised... How have I raised seven flowers?
[381:57.48]Competition's won.
[381:58.68]Affinity.
[382:01.86]So, good friend.
[382:03.70]Friend.
[382:04.04]They're friends.
[382:07.52]Great friend.
[382:13.39]I gotta get the dragon up.
[382:18.29]The dragon just has to be leveled up and fused together.
[382:25.42]In the time that he still has left.
[382:26.80]Yeah, after you fuse them, they become inseparable.
[382:34.64]That's true.
[382:35.26]Let's keep moving.
[382:43.78]Having five monsters on a farm should be priority number one.
[382:49.14]I guess because then they can all be friends, I guess.
[382:53.74]Yeah, alright.
[382:54.36]Let's... I got up to B rank.
[382:57.12]I think that I'm going to call it here.
[382:58.98]Well, not yet.
[382:59.89]I'm going to make two more monsters, get them on the farm, save it, and then we'll call it there.
[383:07.07]So this should take us another like probably 30 minutes or so.
[383:10.75]Let's get some new monsters.
[383:11.53]Let's see how it's going to look.
[383:19.83]Does it matter what town I go to?
[383:21.41]Or what shrine I go to?
[383:22.45]There is no shrine there, is there?
[383:25.09]Alright, I do have some more of these discs up here, so... Which ones did I not use?
[383:40.59]Create.
[383:42.13]From a saucer.
[383:43.69]Alright.
[383:44.93]Let's put in... I put in... What is it?
[383:45.93]Jackass was the last one?
[383:48.89]Who's next?
[383:53.97]We got... Who do I want to put in?
[384:01.24]Stuntman?
[384:01.78]This is Stuntman Ignition.
[384:08.56]I still have to play this one for the PlayStation 3.
[384:13.59]Simpsons Hit and Run, I do have it.
[384:15.07]I can put it in.
[384:16.71]But we'll do this first.
[384:26.98]Put in the Matrix, you get a unique monster.
[384:30.22]I don't have a physical DVD of the Matrix here.
[384:36.52]This is Stuntman Ignition.
[384:47.28]Okay.
[384:51.98]Please insert the Monster Rancher disk.
[385:05.38]Something unique.
[385:05.90]We did unlock two or three new breeds, so we'll see what we get.
[385:15.17]He doesn't have the Matrix?
[385:16.05]No.
[385:16.93]I don't.
[385:22.14]Ape Escape?
[385:22.62]I don't have that either.
[385:25.46]I faked it!
[385:25.96]What do you mean you faked it?
[385:37.23]It's a pumpkin flower.
[385:40.03]It's just a Jack-o'-lantern.
[385:49.89]So many plants.
[385:52.27]I don't want this.
[385:53.49]No.
[385:54.43]Throw it away.
[385:55.34]We're gonna try... I'll put in Simpsons Hit and Run.
[386:07.21]Let me get it first.
[386:07.87]It's over here somewhere.
[386:15.50]Whoa, whoa!
[386:16.18]I almost just ripped out the cord.
[386:21.06]Alright, what the hell even is Simpsons Hidden Run?
[386:28.63]Good luck finding that in here.
[386:29.79]I have to, like, reorganize this whole thing.
[386:40.52]Oh, good luck.
[386:42.10]This whole closet needs to be completely reorganized.
[386:44.34]Alright, I got Lifeline, the stupid voice activation game.
[386:53.61]There's so many discs in here.
[386:54.83]There's so many trays.
[386:56.43]There's total distortion.
[386:57.83]I'll try that.
[387:00.41]We'll put in Lifeline.
[387:02.14]I gotta clean that closet up.
[387:15.17]Show it?
[387:15.49]I'll show it after this to make sure you know I'm not cheating.
[387:23.14]There's a buzz sound.
[387:24.56]Did I fuck it up?
[387:32.28]I did rip it out.
[387:32.96]Hold on.
[387:38.10]How did this even happen?
[387:49.37]What on Earth did I do?
[387:50.55]Did I fix it?
[388:06.18]Did I make it worse?
[388:15.35]Still crusty?
[388:16.07]OK.
[388:17.63]Well, this is from Lifeline.
[388:19.03]Let's see what we get.
[388:27.56]I need two more things just to stand there and become friends with each other.
[388:45.19]is one of the Powerpuff Girls.
[388:47.68]Which one is this one?
[388:51.22]Blossom?
[389:20.88]Like that?
[389:23.30]Bloomer?
[389:27.29]No, it's not like a possum.
[389:29.53]Well, the thing is though, listen, it kind of looks like a possum.
[389:37.91]I think it works.
[389:43.16]It's Blossom the Possum.
[389:52.20]It does not actually... If I do Bloomer, that's just like the meme on the channel.
[390:12.21]It's not even a flower, guys.
[390:16.56]Bloomus!
[390:20.36]I'm going with the original one.
[390:28.92]Volumis.
[390:30.06]No, Blossom.
[390:37.11]It's the Powerpuff Girl.
[390:38.19]Blossom.
[390:40.83]Again, we'll do it again.
[390:42.89]This time we'll put in... I'll try Total Distortion on this game, see what we get.
[390:46.49]Thank you for not making another boomer joke.
[390:56.24]No, I'm not gonna...
[390:59.26]We've overstayed the welcome with oomers.
[391:07.24]Vroomer, shroomer, boomer, bloomer, doomer.
[391:12.79]This is total distortion.
[391:34.42]Is Prover a boomer joke?
[391:37.47]No.
[391:38.27]It's close, though.
[391:44.01]Let's see.
[391:45.27]Alright.
[391:48.03]Rolling the dice on this one, because whatever it is, I think we're... Where'd it go?
[391:55.92]Where'd the disk just go?
[391:56.80]I think it was like $70.
[392:00.10]Don't lose it.
[392:00.66]$45 at least.
[392:17.18]Didn't fake it.
[392:17.74]Something we haven't seen yet.
[392:31.97]Not another flower, or a mushroom, or a rumor.
[392:36.55]Something we haven't seen.
[392:40.17]Oh, give me a fucking break.
[392:53.18]We're going to put in the regular Stuntman.
[393:01.48]This is Stuntman 1, not Stuntman Ignition.
[393:05.18]What did we get from Ignition?
[393:31.01]When is Stuntman coming?
[393:31.99]I have to just get it.
[393:37.41]Please do Urban Chaos.
[393:38.40]Didn't I already do Urban Chaos?
[393:45.26]Why are ads on some random shitty ad popped up out of nowhere?
[393:48.48]That shouldn't be happening.
[393:51.04]Pre-rolls I cannot turn off.
[393:53.27]But you should not be getting an ad during the stream, ever.
[393:55.67]That should never happen.
[394:00.80]if you got like a pop-up that I think that might be coming from somewhere else yeah pre-rolls like when you open up the stream you'll get an ad but during the stream you should never see an ad I don't run them I don't think I've ran an ad on this channel in three and a half years
[394:39.23]Run one right now.
[394:40.47]I don't even know how.
[394:44.00]How do you even run an ad?
[394:47.00]Is it on the dashboard?
[394:48.04]I have not ran an ad in like fucking four years on this channel.
[395:00.88]Do it now.
[395:08.35]We'll be right back.
[395:32.41]Is anybody getting an ad?
[395:41.35]Hey, welcome back!
[395:43.27]Thanks for checking out the ad break!
[395:52.74]Try running another.
[395:53.94]No, I'm not just gonna run fucking ads.
[395:55.94]Everybody will leave.
[396:00.64]If I start running ads, they're usually five times louder than the stream.
[396:04.58]People are just gonna leave.
[396:07.46]I'm not gonna do that again.
[396:14.72]I can't- I can't run it.
[396:15.68]I just tried to click it again.
[396:19.66]I just got, like, yelled at by Twitch.
[396:22.69]Because you can't run- I can only run an ad every eight minutes.
[396:27.80]Somebody just gave 50 bucks.
[396:29.14]Why did I get another fucking mushroom?
[396:30.78]This is so annoying.
[396:33.76]Uh, amscoots thanks for 50 bucks.
[396:36.49]Run a ad.
[396:39.57]Thank you for 50 dollars, but I- I don't- I don't- I'm not gonna run ads.
[396:55.27]I can only run an ad break.
[396:56.85]Okay, how long can you make an ad break?
[396:59.43]Why would you ever do this?
[397:02.04]Okay, guys, there's a slider here.
[397:05.62]I can run ads for three straight fucking minutes.
[397:12.96]Are you trying to make people leave your channel?
[397:17.58]No way anybody does this.
[397:25.17]Alright guys, it's been like 10 minutes.
[397:28.37]I'm going to run three straight minutes of ads.
[397:35.46]Does anybody actually use that?
[397:36.72]Maybe for like tournaments?
[397:40.00]Do that or I'm going to unsub.
[397:42.04]Alright, I'm going to... I'm going to... No, I'm going to kill my channel.
[397:55.74]Three minutes of ads?
[398:01.52]No, fuck!
[398:02.68]Okay, I got it.
[398:11.37]This is... This is that game, 25 to Life.
[398:15.23]Also PlayStation 2.
[398:16.30]Hopefully we can get out of this rut of seeing the same shit over and over again.
[398:26.56]Do it now.
[398:26.96]I can't do it now.
[398:30.48]I can only run a break every eight minutes.
[398:46.71]Run a three minute ad block.
[398:55.25]Alright.
[398:57.11]No... No shroom.
[399:17.45]It's not a fake disk, it's right here.
[399:28.62]Well, that's how we do it That is a stone beetle That's a very cool monster Yes, I'll take this one
[400:11.73]Ad block or ad rock?
[400:19.85]And every time he shows up, every time he lands a move, I run an ad.
[400:26.76]I'm gonna bury my fucking Twitch channel, I swear to God.
[400:29.40]Ad rock...
[400:44.24]There it is.
[400:47.28]The sound is desynced.
[400:50.25]Like, in the game?
[400:51.17]The audio?
[400:51.73]It shouldn't be.
[400:57.79]Every win with AdRock run a three-minute ad.
[401:01.17]I mean, we actually do joke around about this, but... There are... Okay, let's just put it this way.
[401:07.82]There's probably a bunch of people here that are just hanging out and watching.
[401:12.76]You're just, maybe just sitting there, just chilling.
[401:14.82]Oh, there's a Monster Rancher 4 stream.
[401:16.28]I'll just turn this one on.
[401:17.20]You know what I mean?
[401:17.95]That's fun.
[401:18.25]That sounds fun.
[401:19.45]You're not chatting.
[401:20.23]You're just kind of hanging out.
[401:23.03]If you get three straight minutes of ads, you're going to leave.
[401:26.95]You're going to go, okay, this is, he's doing like a joke thing.
[401:31.15]And like, yeah, everyone's in on it.
[401:32.39]This is like kind of funny.
[401:33.07]But like, fuck three minutes of ads.
[401:34.67]Like, I'm going to leave.
[401:39.60]Nobody wants that.
[401:40.44]Nobody wants to see that.
[401:44.98]We need to timer until the next ad.
[401:54.32]Alright.
[401:55.66]Well, I did say that that was gonna be it.
[401:57.84]We've been going for just about seven hours.
[401:59.00]I'm gonna call it here.
[401:59.90]It would be funny at first, and then after the third or fourth time, it'd be like, I'm sick of hearing the same loud Totino's Pizza Roll ad over and over again.
[402:18.60]Oh, I do want to see their stats.
[402:35.01]That was just an ad.
[402:35.95]No, it wasn't.
[402:36.47]That was me telling you not to watch.
[402:38.43]Look at how many people are here.
[402:39.35]Alright, let's see.
[402:43.65]What are the base stats on Blossom?
[402:47.62]Not bad.
[402:49.70]Almost 150 speed, 140 intelligence.
[402:52.59]That rock is 147 power.
[402:58.25]Pretty terrible, actually, besides the power.
[402:59.97]Let me get the moves.
[403:06.73]Scissors and Whirlwind.
[403:09.15]Lots of Guts damage.
[403:12.19]What about Blossom?
[403:12.91]Scratch and Hawaiian!
[403:20.62]An A for Guts Damage.
[403:27.82]Hawaiian.
[403:28.86]Okay.
[403:29.56]What about Traits?
[403:32.70]Sweet Voice.
[403:33.36]Increase the power of moves that use the voice.
[403:40.69]Ad-Rock sounds like malware.
[403:42.21]It probably is.
[403:43.99]But that's gonna be it, guys.
[403:47.15]Here's the plan.
[403:47.69]I'm going to tell you the plan.
[403:49.25]There's a possibility here.
[403:50.57]So we've got a lot of random things that are going to be happening over the next few days.
[403:54.95]Monster Rancher 4.
[403:56.91]A yay or an ay for Monster Rancher 4 continuing this.
[404:00.65]I... Still fun?
[404:04.53]We got a yay thing, probably?
[404:07.11]I think people are having fun.
[404:08.23]People are enjoying this.
[404:09.07]I am.
[404:12.55]We have our dream team here.
[404:16.64]Let me save it.
[404:18.56]I think it's fun, yeah, I'm having a great time.
[404:22.98]I feel like I'm gonna get really irritated at the countering system, but, you know, it's fine.
[404:34.31]You're asking the people that stuck around for seven hours.
[404:36.39]Yeah, the best people to ask!
[404:44.21]But even- no, this is that- I'll- yeah, fuck it, I'll do it.
[404:46.59]That sounds fun.
[404:47.75]We'll do it again.
[404:50.00]But, in between, the next stream is probably not going to be Monster Ranch 4.
[404:56.08]There's the scratch ticket stream for Sekiro.
[404:59.24]That's gonna take me at least like an hour or two to scratch those.
[405:01.84]I already got confirmation with Twitch that that should be fine.
[405:05.05]You don't know what that- what's happening there.
[405:07.63]For every time I died in Sekiro, I'm buying that amount monetarily in scratch tickets.
[405:15.31]So whether it's a bunch of $10, $5, equaling $221.
[405:18.93]I'm going to scratch all those tickets on stream, and whatever happens through those tickets is going to go right to charity.
[405:31.28]If I don't win anything, if it's zero, I'm going to donate $221 to that charity anyways.
[405:36.33]So, win or lose.
[405:48.07]That was something that... Why... Why 221?
[405:50.57]I died 221 times in Sekiro.
[405:53.38]And said that I was going to get a scratch ticket for every death.
[405:57.16]Even if it's a million dollars?
[405:58.44]Yes.
[406:00.30]If I hit a million dollars on one of these scratch tickets, the charity is getting a million dollars.
[406:04.74]That's just going to happen.
[406:09.25]Why'd you die that much?
[406:15.21]Alright.
[406:16.27]Whatever.
[406:18.30]It's gonna be funny when you only donate $6, because you only win $6.
[406:22.47]But that- I just told you.
[406:26.55]Regardless of anything, I'm going to donate at least $221.
[406:29.97]Like, if I- Scratch up, like, hundreds of dollars worth of tickets, you win, like, eight bucks.
[406:42.54]Alright, $8 is going here!
[406:46.78]No.
[406:47.74]That would be so... That would be dumb.
[406:54.12]But, that's the plan.
[406:58.56]That's including revives.
[406:59.74]No, they kept track.
[407:03.94]There was the actual deaths, I think.
[407:16.07]Please do a three-minute ad.
[407:17.35]I would love to see some products to buy.
[407:26.21]So, the charity that I'm going to choose... I have not decided yet.
[407:31.68]I have narrowed it down to a few.
[407:42.24]What about taxes?
[407:43.04]Okay, so whatever I can... So, okay, let's say I, on stream, hit like... This is probably not going to happen.
[407:52.82]But if I win like 50 grand on a scratch ticket on stream, I don't know how taxes work with that.
[408:00.16]I don't know.
[408:01.02]This is a question for my CPA.
[408:02.66]Because if I win 50 grand on a scratch ticket, a bunch of that's taxed.
[408:10.97]So then I would have to pay taxes on that, but I would be giving it to charity.
[408:17.34]But charity is deductible from taxes, but would that count as income?
[408:25.99]I would be getting 50 grand of income and writing off 50 grand of income.
[408:33.87]How does that work?
[408:39.92]I'm gonna, okay, I'm gonna call my CPA about this.
[408:42.24]He's gonna think I'm fucking insane.
[408:45.78]Hey, so I have a question for you.
[408:50.10]If I buy $200 worth of scratch tickets and I win 50 grand and give 50 grand to charity, what happens to my income?
[408:58.86]He's probably gonna go, what the fuck are you talking about?
[409:11.97]He's not gonna hang up on me.
[409:22.09]He's watching now, no.
[409:23.13]Do that voice on the phone.
[409:29.50]Hey, uh, I got a question for you.
[409:35.44]Alright, that's it.
[409:37.00]Let's get out of here.
[409:39.06]Thanks for hanging out, everybody.
[409:47.43]I'll see you guys in a couple days.
[409:49.31]I'll see you on Thursday.
[409:51.97]So, depending on what happens, Etalyx and I, we're going to play Risk of Rain 2 together.
[409:58.87]We were thinking about doing that.
[410:00.79]Monster Rancher 4 has to continue.
[410:02.81]Sekiro, scratch off to charity.
[410:04.99]Stream has to be there.
[410:07.38]And then something else.
[410:09.34]I mean, look, I'll just tell you what it is.
[410:12.72]I'm going to play the Jerma game.
[410:17.34]on stream it's coming up real soon prepare for that it's gonna be it's gonna be real soon on pc yep on pc does that include ads no
[410:41.02]Risk of Rain 2 is very, very good.
[410:43.39]Yeah, so we'll jumble it around, but that's what you can expect over this next week or so.
[410:52.45]Jeremy, roll the ads.
[410:53.49]Okay, I'll do the three minutes of ads at the end of the stream before I leave.
[410:58.62]Because I want everyone that does not want to see three minutes of ads to have an opportunity to just leave.
[411:03.54]So we're gonna do the bits.
[411:11.99]Let's go back, uh, about seven plus hours ago?
[411:16.14]Just about seven hours ago.
[411:18.94]To the beginning.
[411:24.26]And it was Lazy Luke!
[411:25.76]Thanks to the 250, Lazy Luke.
[411:26.92]Did he say jermaHeart?
[411:28.76]That's all, thank you.
[411:30.84]For the 250.
[411:33.00]Thank you also to... Uh, Tingy for the 250.
[411:36.65]If you do have the scratch ticket stream sometime this week, can it please be on the weekend?
[411:40.23]I don't want to miss it due to work.
[411:43.11]It'll probably end up being... Let me just try to think this through here.
[411:49.55]So, nothing tomorrow and Wednesday, and then... Thursday, Friday, Saturday... It'll... Alright.
[411:55.54]I would probably do... Saturday might be a really weird stream.
[412:01.08]Because... Saturday... Might turn out to be... The Sekiro scratch-off and the Jerma slot game stream.
[412:15.71]Because I feel like that would be a whole stream worth of stuff to do.
[412:23.00]Because I feel like scratching the tickets is going to take probably like an hour plus.
[412:29.00]And then that game is going to take a couple hours probably, or an hour plus.
[412:35.85]I feel like that makes sense.
[412:40.07]To have those be on the same day.
[412:44.40]You know, one can kind of prelude to the other.
[412:47.70]Sounds like a plan.
[412:51.84]Uh, and then that makes Thursday and Friday, Monster Rancher 4 will come back, if not Thursday, then Friday, and if me and Etalyx play Risk of Rain, then we'll continue Monster Rancher 4 on Friday.
[413:02.59]So you can probably assume Risk of Rain 2, Monster Rancher 4, and the weird, like, IRL gambling stream, somehow.
[413:16.14]Sounds good.
[413:18.95]So expect that on Saturday.
[413:24.15]You did spend six hours trying to build a birdhouse.
[413:26.01]That's true.
[413:27.17]Was that six hours?
[413:31.87]Is gambling against the TOS?
[413:32.97]No, actually, I talked to two Twitch staff about this.
[413:37.63]And as long as gambling is legal in your area, in your state, it's fine.
[413:43.85]I mean, especially considering that whatever money I would win would just be going to charity.
[413:47.95]There's... I mean, guys, I live in Las Vegas.
[413:56.53]Is gambling legal in Nevada?
[413:59.52]Let me check.
[414:00.50]Let me ask one of the 300 casinos that are within a 15-mile radius of where I'm standing right now.
[414:10.74]Do I still have the birdhouse?
[414:13.67]Uh, I don't think I do.
[414:16.58]I may have thrown that away.
[414:18.70]I think I, like... No, actually, I think it is still downstairs.
[414:23.34]I think it's still there.
[414:27.24]But thank you, Tingy.
[414:29.56]Probably see you on Saturday for that.
[414:33.22]Thank you, Heretic!
[414:37.17]For the $5.00.
[414:41.19]Jeremy, you've been consistently enjoyable to watch and listen to since day one.
[414:44.19]Never stop being you.
[414:44.95]Much love.
[414:46.47]Well, thank you.
[414:48.98]That means a lot.
[414:53.50]If you think I'm that consistently fun to listen to.
[414:56.44]Because I think about that a lot.
[415:02.99]I think about all the things people say about this channel.
[415:06.81]And I want you to keep having fun here.
[415:09.79]I want you to keep enjoying these streams.
[415:14.71]I think about, especially in the shower, I'll just be like, what's going on today?
[415:18.56]What's going on this week?
[415:20.66]Let's do something fun.
[415:21.62]What is that, though?
[415:22.16]Is that going to be fun?
[415:26.34]I'm glad you guys are enjoying it.
[415:27.34]Because I'm enjoying it, too.
[415:32.65]Jules, thanks for the 250.
[415:33.99]Hey, compact child of Thanos.
[415:36.61]Tickets for Avengers Endgame are on sale.
[415:39.03]Will you be watching it opening week with a crowd of people in IMAX, or would you prefer watching it a little later when things simmer down in the theaters?
[415:46.45]Watching either way has its benefits, but I just want to know how you like to watch your movies.
[415:50.97]I like to watch my movies in an empty theater.
[415:58.94]Because anytime I go to a movie that's packed, it's always been one of those scenarios where every possible moment for somebody to scream, Yeah!
[416:10.07]Oh, whoa!
[416:11.21]What the?
[416:13.45]Whoa!
[416:15.43]Like Spider-Man shows up for the first time and it's like, Spider-Man!
[416:18.93]Spider-Man!
[416:19.69]Woo!
[416:20.15]It's like we all know he's in the fucking movie.
[416:22.79]I know Spider-Man's in the movie.
[416:24.89]You know Spider-Man's in the movie.
[416:26.69]Why do we all have to cheer when Spider-Man shows up in the movie?
[416:30.11]You saw the trailer.
[416:31.27]Spider-Man's in this movie.
[416:33.15]Iron Man does like a big blast out of his hands.
[416:38.57]Everybody screams.
[416:40.15]It's like he didn't do anything.
[416:53.07]They should really only fill half the theater for the real experience.
[416:57.90]Well, for being a little bit, uh, because, uh, because of... They want to make sure that there's not enough, not a lot of noise in the theater, you know what I mean?
[417:09.52]I see exactly what you mean by that.
[417:13.51]Because it could get loud in the theater, and it should be, like, easier to hear and stuff.
[417:18.01]That's why I know exactly what you're talking about, thank you.
[417:22.55]People clap during the theater?
[417:29.57]What are you clapping for?
[417:30.31]They can't hear you.
[417:34.17]Thanos is coming in for the big punch.
[417:36.89]Iron Man spins around and like knocks him out.
[417:39.98]Nice.
[417:40.98]Nice job.
[417:41.74]Tony.
[417:42.94]Tony, I love you.
[417:55.34]One time that happened and I stood up.
[417:58.21]And I pointed up at the, like five people started clapping and like screaming.
[418:05.91]I saw somebody was on their phone.
[418:07.39]I heard like a fucking phone ringing.
[418:08.73]Turn your phone off too, by the way.
[418:10.28]Don't bring your phone into the movie.
[418:11.42]I don't understand.
[418:12.14]Everybody knows not to be on your phone in the movie theater.
[418:15.84]And everybody gets angry at other people for being on the phone, yet you will open up your phone and look at it.
[418:20.99]And then somebody five seats down is mad that you're opening up your phone.
[418:24.31]And that person also gets pissed off when other people use their phone and then they open up their phone.
[418:30.56]It's a cycle.
[418:31.46]It's a vicious circle of everyone using their phones and being mad at other people for using their phones.
[418:35.56]Just don't do it.
[418:37.96]Anyways.
[418:39.32]This was all happening.
[418:40.10]Loud noises, fucking 3G data flying around.
[418:43.65]It was pissing me off.
[418:44.47]So I got up and I stood up and I pointed at the projector.
[418:47.91]The guy that was running the projector.
[418:50.23]I said, pause it.
[418:51.25]Pause the movie for a minute.
[418:53.60]And he was like, he couldn't hear me.
[418:55.39]People were just screaming and laughing and clapping at Tony Stark.
[418:57.85]I was like, pause!
[418:58.55]Put the movie on pause!
[419:00.37]And he like, and it was just sitting there frozen.
[419:04.90]I said, put the house lights on.
[419:08.80]And then he turned them on.
[419:11.06]And I went, shh, shh, shh, shh.
[419:12.86]And then everybody just, oh, whoa.
[419:16.15]I went, I did my teacher move.
[419:19.31]Everybody shut up.
[419:20.65]I said, listen, we all want to enjoy this movie.
[419:26.02]Some of you have your kids here.
[419:27.38]Some of you were here with your, you know, your boyfriends and your girlfriends or whoever.
[419:32.44]Everyone just wants to have a good time here.
[419:35.74]Please, just relax and enjoy the film.
[419:38.68]The thing we all had to pay the same amount of money to get in here.
[419:44.08]And people looked around for a second.
[419:46.76]And about five seconds after, it got real quiet.
[419:54.02]And I got hit in the face with a package of Mike and Ikes.
[419:58.00]And it broke my notes.
[420:00.10]And everyone started laughing.
[420:03.94]And at the same time, all these assholes pulled their phones out.
[420:08.22]None of them were turned off.
[420:12.21]And I could hear the collective iPhone take a picture sound.
[420:25.94]And I heard like a crash up where the projector was.
[420:31.29]Like the guy with the projector was laughing so hard.
[420:35.38]He was cracking up so hard he fucking fell down and knocked the canister over.
[420:43.75]Long story short, everybody got a refund.
[420:48.87]I didn't go to the next showing though.
[420:50.01]It was like 20 minutes later.
[420:57.87]Let me give you a long, just a T-L-D-E.
[421:01.66]Too long, didn't ear.
[421:04.20]Put your phones away.
[421:05.98]Enjoy the movie.
[421:06.52]You can, like, look, you can lean over and, like, whisper.
[421:09.54]Hey, whoa, whoa, that was fucking fucked up.
[421:10.68]I can't believe, dude, he just, like, bended time with his hands?
[421:14.20]Yeah, that's fine.
[421:26.09]Don't do that.
[421:28.96]Be good.
[421:29.96]Be nice in the theater.
[421:32.40]Everyone had to pay the same amount of money.
[421:33.52]Don't throw Mike and Ikes at anybody.
[421:34.66]It's not funny.
[421:36.20]I'm serious.
[421:36.60]Don't do that.
[421:36.98]That shit's fucked up.
[421:46.77]Just buy the movie when it comes out.
[421:48.05]But I'll give tip for... I like going with a smaller, slightly empty theater.
[421:55.27]Because it makes me feel like the movie's for me.
[421:58.47]It's kind of weird, but it's true.
[422:02.44]But thank you, Jules, for the 250.
[422:04.46]I'm looking forward to Avengers Endgame.
[422:12.72]Should be good.
[422:13.43]L-U-L.
[422:13.61]What do you mean?
[422:28.33]I don't get it.
[422:29.73]Thanks for the 10 bucks, though.
[422:32.07]Frodeon Weapon, thanks for the 250.
[422:34.55]Yes, I need help with the bench.
[422:37.07]Oh, oh, right.
[422:38.83]I forgot that happened.
[422:47.25]What a fucking disaster.
[422:49.44]Thank you for the 250, Frodeon.
[422:50.64]Sad Vega, thanks for the 250.
[422:51.82]I'm laughing so hard and crying at work.
[422:54.02]Just watching you try to listen to the brown noise and then talk to us.
[422:57.74]You're a madman.
[423:01.45]That went really off the rails, completely.
[423:04.69]There was no stopping that train, and I realized it pretty much halfway through it.
[423:14.62]Jess, you got it.
[423:15.24]Thanks for the 250.
[423:16.48]They said you're a gift to the world.
[423:18.36]I don't know about that, but thank you for the kind words and the 250.
[423:30.43]He wants to go to an empty theater because he didn't want to be laughed at for dressing up as Thanos.
[423:39.58]Alright, I like- I go into the movie theater dressed up.
[423:42.36]It's like you're really like a big fan and it's great.
[423:48.32]But don't you think you should go dressed up to a place where it's not like pitch black?
[423:54.36]The only people that can see you in your Darth Vader costume is the guy serving the popcorn.
[424:03.60]Like, you come into the theater in, like, your full Darth Vader costume, and nobody can see you.
[424:13.71]And how uncomfortable is it to be in full costume and sit in one of those seats?
[424:19.49]Not very many people do that.
[424:23.70]Imagine how hot you would get in, like, the Darth Vader costume sitting in a theater with 300 people.
[424:35.43]If you do that, I hope you enjoy it.
[424:37.71]I just hope that you're out there, before the movie starts, like, posing and, like, doing, like, fake, like, lightsaber poses, and, like, taking pictures with people.
[424:51.77]Darth Vader is from Star Wars, not Avengers.
[424:55.33]You show up in a Darth Vader costume for the Avengers movie, and you're like, oh, fuck.
[424:59.38]I forgot.
[424:59.98]This is the wrong movie.
[425:00.96]I thought this was Episode 8.
[425:10.46]The most ambitious crossover.
[425:23.33]Oh god.
[425:26.25]That from Yen Wen, look at that.
[425:31.63]That looks like the 3D mapping of a character in a video game.
[425:35.72]Like they scanned my face.
[425:43.69]That's insanely good.
[425:50.17]But, thank you.
[425:59.60]Thank you Silverflame for the 250.
[426:01.06]I remember when you got drunk Labo and got so many sweet donation messages.
[426:06.48]Some guy even gave a thousand dollars.
[426:09.76]You got emotional but didn't cry, but you play farting and screaming noises at once and suddenly water works.
[426:17.34]That's different though.
[426:21.06]When I like laugh and my brain gets on overdrive and I start like laughing and can't control it, like that's an automatic body response to like stress.
[426:33.63]That's like body stress.
[426:45.32]What a crappy video?
[426:47.42]What video?
[426:51.11]What is this?
[426:52.55]That's not what my hair looks like?
[426:54.31]That's not what my hair looks like.
[427:01.05]You fucked this up on purpose.
[427:04.16]That is not what my hair looks like.
[427:07.82]Spider-Man 3 Peter Parker.
[427:16.97]There's a whole album with faces.
[427:20.27]Oh my god.
[427:21.06]What on Earth is happening on this channel?
[427:46.52]We've seen all these pretty much.
[427:48.00]Some of these are just the ones we've already seen, but just the smudge tool from Photoshop used a little bit more.
[428:12.43]I can't even look at them.
[428:45.00]Oh, that's too much, man.
[428:51.69]I'm gonna die.
[428:56.37]Jesus.
[429:03.26]Thank you, Silverflame, for the $2.50, though.
[429:06.06]Sawdust Bunnies thanks the $2.50.
[429:07.14]They say, haha.
[429:10.17]Thank you, Sad Vega, for the 250.
[429:11.87]Jerma, I had a call come in for work when you started playing the farts and screams.
[429:16.11]I was crying tears of laughter.
[429:17.51]I had to take a few seconds to compose myself and mute the stream.
[429:21.77]Oh Lord, it's a miracle I made it through that call.
[429:26.14]I'm sorry.
[429:27.82]Hopefully you didn't... Hopefully you were able to compose yourself.
[429:33.82]Thank you, though.
[429:34.44]Thank you, Dorkube, for the 250.
[429:37.13]Oh my god, that's the hardest I've ever laughed in a long fucking time.
[429:40.22]And it was the kind of laugh where you run out of air and have to take a huge breath.
[429:43.24]I'm still recovering.
[429:50.32]Thank you.
[429:50.78]Thank you, eHalfnote, for the five bucks.
[429:52.82]Thank you for making us all cry about farts.
[429:58.19]Thank you for the $5.
[429:59.17]Thank you, Drummage!
[430:00.79]Drummage Dora for the $5.
[430:02.97]Imagine the embarrassment getting tinnitus from farts.
[430:05.69]Thanks for the laugh.
[430:06.79]Best laugh I've had in years.
[430:10.43]That was wild.
[430:11.09]Thank you.
[430:15.69]GuyAtTheGym.
[430:21.18]DarkSoul9669, thanks for the $15.
[430:27.08]Have these bits.
[430:27.80]I had tears running down my face and I sweat through all my fucking clothes.
[430:33.17]Thank you.
[430:36.73]Thank you for the $15 and the incredibly nice thing to say.
[430:40.57]Thank you.
[430:41.03]I'm glad you had fun.
[430:48.68]And then... Also from Dorkube, thanks for the $2.50.
[430:57.54]Look at my beautiful boy.
[430:58.86]And it's that image right here.
[431:00.68]It says, when you think your dad's crying because he finally got to see his beautiful boy get married.
[431:05.55]But he's really just listening to farts and screams way too loud through his earpods.
[431:13.99]Hawkeye, thank you for the $30.
[431:15.73]30 bucks.
[431:18.49]You're making the next Sims family album.
[431:27.84]My face, man.
[431:28.71]It's so fucked up.
[431:29.87]Like, there are things that you never want.
[431:35.47]Like, okay, as... You never want to be on camera crying, right?
[431:41.19]Nobody... Like a picture.
[431:43.84]You want to be smiling or composed.
[431:48.38]That's so fucked up, Logan.
[431:53.34]Just make this an e-vote.
[431:54.96]I'm gonna have to.
[431:59.66]But Hawkeye of mine, thank you so much for the $30.
[432:05.22]Something or other, thanks for the $2.50.
[432:06.64]Don't cry because it's over.
[432:07.82]Smile because it happened.
[432:12.57]Thank you.
[432:14.71]Core monster, thanks for the $5.
[432:17.43]Jerma, age 54, pondering the marriages of his child.
[432:25.10]That looks like a
[432:28.12]That looks like a portrait of, like, a president.
[432:38.16]Oh my god, that's so fucking funny.
[432:39.54]Thank you, Corn Monster.
[432:43.44]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the $2.50.
[432:44.52]Hey, Jeremy, wish I could give more gift subs, but I'm planning a trip to Texas.
[432:49.99]It's probably not a good idea.
[432:52.21]Hope all is well.
[432:52.87]Have a good night, Jeremy, and chat.
[432:56.91]Thank you for the $2.50 and thank you for the gift subs as well.
[433:02.33]Hopefully you have a fun time in Texas whenever you go.
[433:07.85]And thank you so much for the $2.50.
[433:08.95]FreudianWeapon, thanks for the $10.
[433:13.35]Here's that $10 you thought I gave earlier.
[433:17.03]Seriously though, tonight's stream has been hilarious and uplifting.
[433:19.69]Especially after having a shit day at work.
[433:22.27]Thanks for being here and chat too.
[433:24.98]Absolutely.
[433:29.65]Thank you, Frodeon, for the 10 bucks.
[433:32.79]Glad that this stream and this community can make your day a little better.
[433:35.36]Thank you.
[433:40.68]PeacefulHaley, again, thanks for 260 here, PeacefulHaley.
[433:45.08]And here are some more bits because I want my 5,000-bit badge.
[433:49.60]I can't imagine donating to any other streamer.
[433:54.25]I can't imagine anybody donating to me in the first place, but people do, and it's... It's... I can't fucking believe it.
[433:59.85]Thank you, guys.
[434:09.98]You guys are awesome.
[434:15.08]Thank you for the support.
[434:16.66]Thank you, PeacefulHaley, for the 260.
[434:20.92]Thank you, it's time for slime for the five dollars.
[434:23.10]Guys, the secret to grinding XP and stream legends super fast is to repeatedly redo the first level of the raid over and over since it's much faster than doing the rest of the levels and gives the same amount of XP and gold.
[434:33.08]Here's my IQ.
[434:34.93]There you go.
[434:35.57]You're giving away the secrets.
[434:40.99]Redo the boss battle, not the first level.
[434:42.91]Well, we got a problem here between people fighting on how to do stream legends.
[434:53.72]Thank you, though.
[434:54.24]It's time for slime for the five bucks.
[434:57.54]DoorCube, thanks for the 250, DoorCube.
[435:00.70]I know this is kind of tuber bait, but you should try doing a stream of improv scenes with a speech jammer.
[435:07.51]I'm pretty sure you wouldn't even need any extra programs.
[435:10.81]You just need to play your mic audio from the stream back into your headphones.
[435:17.93]I don't know.
[435:18.49]I don't know if I could do that.
[435:20.53]I've tried doing stuff like that before and I can't even speak.
[435:24.11]Guys, I can't wear two headphones because I can't talk.
[435:26.20]I don't know if I'd be able to do a whole stream like that.
[435:30.22]Maybe like a 10 to 15 minute segment.
[435:35.60]But thank you, DoorQ.
[435:37.96]Internet Jorge, thanks for the $15.
[435:42.94]$15.
[435:43.86]You almost gave me a heart attack with the soft lock.
[435:46.63]Yeah.
[435:46.77]Yeah.
[435:48.62]It was, uh... You just have to press X. I thought the CD wasn't being read for somehow.
[435:55.87]But thankfully that didn't happen.
[435:57.73]And we keep our progress.
[435:58.89]That's good.
[436:00.03]Thank you for the 15 bucks.
[436:01.51]That's a lot of money.
[436:02.17]Appreciate it.
[436:04.98]Uh, Hamburglio.
[436:06.24]Thank you, Hamburglio, for the 10 bucks.
[436:10.90]Jerma, I haven't had a chance to watch many of your streams, but I've seen most of the stuff on your YouTube accounts.
[436:15.50]I want to say thank you for all your hard work.
[436:17.01]It's an inspiration to see someone care so much about what they do.
[436:21.27]And then I want to add that your content always makes me laugh despite myself.
[436:26.05]And it's brought me laughter when I most needed it.
[436:28.48]Thank you so much for all you've done and keep up the amazing work.
[436:34.32]Thank you so much.
[436:39.26]I'm ecstatic that people can get enjoyment, fun, relief, friends, community here.
[436:49.42]It's, I mean, that's amazing.
[436:51.46]That's more than anything I could ever ask for.
[436:54.40]Ever.
[436:57.19]So thank you for that.
[437:06.55]This one's freaking me out.
[437:07.95]Should I?
[437:08.29]No, it's more... No, it's staying.
[437:10.73]No, this one's awful.
[437:11.67]Put it on this one.
[437:12.38]No, this one.
[437:13.48]No, this one.
[437:15.18]No, this one.
[437:16.42]Yeah, that one's fine.
[437:31.69]Wait, wait, wait.
[437:42.90]That's better.
[437:45.86]Okay.
[437:50.34]But thank you, Hamburg Leo, for the ten bucks.
[437:53.50]Means a lot.
[437:57.30]Chunky Baloney!
[437:57.98]Ten dollars from Chunky Baloney.
[437:59.16]Here's a donation in honor of that guy's birthday.
[438:00.99]Happy birthday.
[438:01.65]Hey, happy birthday, that guy.
[438:03.67]Whoever you were, happy birthday.
[438:06.35]And thank you, Chunky Baloney, for the ten dollars.
[438:10.29]Thousand bits.
[438:11.27]Thank you.
[438:16.31]Thank you MEEF Pleeble for the $2.50!
[438:18.13]Well played!
[438:47.90]Wait, Family Guy?
[438:54.98]Family Guy joke?
[439:03.34]Thank you, Meef.
[439:03.86]Appreciate it.
[439:06.28]Hey, Dr. Clay, thanks for the $2.50.
[439:09.36]They say, I had to do this.
[439:14.75]It's a media file.
[439:21.76]Use item on... Is this a video?
[439:24.86]Hold on a second.
[439:27.68]What the hell?
[439:32.84]What did I just save this to?
[439:33.62]It's like a movie.
[439:39.00]Alright, hold on.
[439:50.41]Where did this save to?
[439:56.35]No, save it to the desktop.
[439:59.91]No, save it to the desktop.
[440:05.61]Save it to the desktop.
[440:06.69]Come on.
[440:08.06]There we go.
[440:08.32]Alright, let's watch this.
[440:21.02]Wait, hold on.
[440:22.24]Why can I not hear this?
[440:27.42]All I can hear is the music from Monster Rancher.
[440:29.24]There we go.
[440:30.72]Now I can hear this.
[440:33.24]Ready?
[440:33.78]One, two, three, play.
[440:34.90]Why can I not hear it now?
[440:41.49]What?
[440:42.01]I can't hear this.
[440:43.55]Wait, what just happened?
[441:03.27]Oh, okay, here we go.
[441:19.48]That's a pretty good- I'm- I did not plan that.
[441:22.54]Just kind of happened.
[441:24.15]But that was Dr. Clay.
[441:25.05]Thank you Dr. Clay for the 250.
[441:28.53]And that video.
[441:34.18]Do you remember a lot about Minecraft VR thanks to the 250?
[441:36.16]Enable POG, you coward.
[441:37.62]I can't.
[441:38.46]I can't do it.
[441:41.22]Internet Jorge, 15 more dollars here.
[441:43.78]15 bucks.
[441:44.38]BoomerStreamer actually makes a funny joke for once.
[441:47.92]Hey.
[441:50.52]I take a lot of pride in the things that I say and the jokes that I come up with.
[441:58.31]For the story about how I shaved the gold off and hide it.
[442:01.67]And people told me to shut the fuck up and play the game.
[442:03.81]Because it was a bad joke and it wasn't funny.
[442:06.07]I take pride in that.
[442:08.44]In that routine that I did.
[442:18.34]But thank you for the $15.
[442:18.92]I really appreciate that.
[442:24.94]That's a lot of money.
[442:25.56]You're giving a lot of money today.
[442:27.78]Tar, Alakrin, thanks for the three bucks.
[442:30.52]Hey Jerma, I donated some bits last stream, but didn't realize you raised the minimum.
[442:34.54]I'm donating again to re-ask the question you missed on last time due to your greed.
[442:41.08]Anyways, I just wanted to know what's up with your closet, man.
[442:43.34]Why is it so messy?
[442:44.63]Just shut the door, maybe.
[442:45.71]Here's a clip.
[442:48.41]We just talked about this.
[442:50.31]Hey, bro.
[442:51.49]What's going on, man?
[442:52.95]You need some help with the bench?
[442:57.99]Let me get up there and... What are you doing?
[443:03.94]200 pounds?
[443:04.12]220?
[443:04.14]Yeah, that's what I thought.
[443:04.92]You're a strong guy.
[443:07.38]Yeah.
[443:09.18]Yeah, I read that book, too.
[443:10.44]It's a good book.
[443:12.22]What do you mean, read that book?
[443:19.03]Okay, there's two tripods in the closet and a pillow.
[443:22.41]Here, look.
[443:24.97]We'll break this down.
[443:35.62]Hey, bro.
[443:36.78]What's going on, man?
[443:37.90]Okay.
[443:38.26]You need some help with the, uh, with the bench?
[443:42.94]That's a tripod, a tripod, a pillow, and then a bunch of electronics.
[443:48.38]220?
[443:48.60]Yeah, that's what I thought.
[443:50.25]You're a strong guy.
[443:52.71]Yeah.
[443:54.51]Yeah, I read that book, too.
[443:55.37]That's a good book.
[443:58.65]Look at how hard this is doing.
[443:59.67]Look at this.
[444:03.39]I can't do it for more than five seconds.
[444:13.24]It's so hard to do that.
[444:17.47]The pillows from the death count downstream.
[444:19.85]Probably.
[444:23.47]Oh, there's a trash bag on the ground, too.
[444:25.09]Did you guys see that?
[444:26.33]There's a bag of trash behind me, but it's not actually filled with trash.
[444:29.19]I don't think you guys saw it.
[444:37.40]Maybe you did.
[444:40.28]There's no trash in there.
[444:41.48]It's filled with stuff.
[444:44.49]I use it as a storage thing to help move things around.
[444:47.49]Well, now we know it's there.
[444:52.77]But thank you, Tar Alacrin.
[444:53.73]Appreciate it.
[444:55.48]Flank Tank thinks it's free bucks, Flank Tank.
[444:57.32]I just finished watching your Sekiro VODs and at the end you said every other game will be easy.
[445:01.66]And I said, oh yeah?
[445:02.66]Go beat Nioh on stream.
[445:04.32]At least before Nioh 2.
[445:08.80]Sekiro... Sekiro's harder than Nioh.
[445:13.07]It just is.
[445:14.15]I'm going to say that.
[445:15.43]Sekiro is harder to game than Nioh.
[445:18.42]Because I beat it.
[445:19.96]And I played it.
[445:20.44]Therefore, it's harder.
[445:28.58]Because I played it.
[445:33.39]No, I didn't like Nioh.
[445:34.65]I wasn't a fan of Nioh.
[445:36.65]Couldn't get into it.
[445:37.25]I really tried.
[445:41.52]I really could not do it.
[445:43.28]I just didn't want to.
[445:48.31]And I told this story before.
[445:50.95]Even after the drunk, shit-faced whiskey stream where I played Nioh and embarrassed myself, I went back months later and just tried on my own time to play Nioh and I didn't want to play it.
[446:02.48]I didn't like it.
[446:04.24]Sorry.
[446:05.60]Just the truth.
[446:09.46]I can see how people enjoy it, but I didn't.
[446:13.12]Not for me.
[446:16.02]That siege, thanks for the ten bucks, they say, bamboozled.
[446:19.00]Huh.
[446:19.12]Whatever.
[446:19.64]What do you mean?
[446:22.37]But I do.
[446:24.73]But thank you, that siege.
[446:26.75]For the ten bucks?
[446:33.19]Baited something.
[446:35.25]That Siege again, thanks for $4.20.
[446:37.01]No message, just $4.20.
[446:38.92]I think that was the attack power.
[446:41.32]We were trying to go over 400.
[446:45.92]Thank you, though.
[446:46.58]Thank you all, Mew, for the three bucks.
[446:48.10]Hey, Jerma, I love it when I get the make.
[446:50.51]I love it when I get to make the livestream, especially when I've got a plumber in my house fixing our hot water.
[446:57.49]He said there was an issue with the heater, almost.
[447:02.14]He tried.
[447:02.52]Okay, if you didn't put the dash between the B and the H, I would have said it.
[447:12.41]You dashed it, though.
[447:14.41]But thank you, AllMew, for the three bucks.
[447:17.27]Something will order.
[447:17.85]Thanks for the $2.50.
[447:22.33]was digging through some files and found a cover for a children's book joke I was thinking about doing but ended up scrapping it oh do I dare put this link in chat because it's just a gnome I mean this is a gnome just want to warn you before you click it so just for those of you that were wondering thank you something or other for the 250 and the gnome children's book
[447:55.83]Smelly boy, thanks for the $2.50.
[447:57.07]I still cannot believe the farting and screaming incident.
[447:59.26]Neither can I. And I forgot.
[448:00.36]I almost forgot what happened.
[448:03.28]Thank you, Pika Banana, for the $5.
[448:05.70]Thanks for the stream.
[448:06.32]I can't wait to see those lottery scratchers.
[448:08.28]Hope you win big for charity.
[448:10.77]That'd be pretty awesome.
[448:13.01]We'll see.
[448:15.13]See what I get.
[448:17.70]Hey, Garfield, a Monday killer.
[448:18.86]Thanks for the $2.50.
[448:20.40]Here's an ad, Jerm.
[448:21.52]Buy the new Garf book.
[448:22.62]It's got tons of funny comics.
[448:24.64]For Don't Read Garfield, it's the worst comic.
[448:27.70]I'm Jerma, and if you buy Garfield comics, I'm going to be real mad and tell Mom.
[448:31.79]Thanks for the ad, Jerma.
[448:33.11]I really miss Rumor since he was your goofer.
[448:35.93]What's a Jerma stream without a good goof?
[448:37.77]Now it's just zombie plant, boring dragon, and rock ant.
[448:41.37]Blossom at least is cute, but now we don't get a fun, goofy monster.
[448:47.04]You gotta recruit a goofy.
[448:48.44]Garfield's telling you, goof it up.
[448:57.65]Will do.
[448:58.57]Was that English?
[448:59.63]Yes, it was.
[449:02.67]When are you gonna play Monster Rancher 4?
[449:05.65]today two days ago and like two or three days from now come on come on oh you did the smiley face ah that's the new Kappa I forgot thank you to clements thank you to clements grumble for the 10 bucks
[449:28.77]I haven't laughed.
[449:30.15]I laughed the hardest I've laughed in years during the intermission today.
[449:33.77]Thanks for the years of great streams.
[449:34.85]You mentioned before you used to play Diablo II for hours.
[449:36.83]Would you ever consider playing it or something like it on stream?
[449:41.75]I don't think so.
[449:42.74]The last game that I played that was a isometric RPG like that was Grim Dawn.
[449:49.30]And I played it through the third act.
[449:51.86]It was before it was all done.
[449:54.08]And I never went back and finished it, but...
[449:57.22]I don't think I would stream a game like that.
[449:58.36]A game like that is probably something I would do just for to kind of chill out and just open my mouth and play a game.
[450:10.80]Maybe for a chill stream it would make sense.
[450:16.76]But not something that's in the pipeline or anything.
[450:22.88]But yeah, the intermission today was uh
[450:28.87]Kind of threw the whole thing off for a little while, but it was still fun.
[450:33.31]Glad you enjoyed it.
[450:34.05]Thank you for the $10.
[450:36.69]Juno Upsetto, thanks for the $2.50.
[450:38.11]The farting and screaming bit made an otherwise mediocre day into an amazing one.
[450:44.55]You really are a gift to the world.
[450:47.06]Thank you.
[450:51.88]I'm honored.
[450:54.10]and happy that just a mediocre day can be turned into something that you remember and had a lot of fun.
[451:01.14]That means a lot.
[451:06.14]Thank you.
[451:16.95]So humble.
[451:20.23]Well, I'm...
[451:28.25]Look.
[451:29.39]Look, look, look, look.
[451:35.05]As I try as hard as I can to stay as grounded as I can as a person.
[451:39.90]You know what I mean?
[451:45.16]I never want to get an ego large enough where like I don't give a shit or I think I'm some master or
[452:01.64]Not that that ever would happen, but I like to keep myself fairly with my ear and head to the ground.
[452:11.16]Yeah, I don't have that tagline.
[452:12.98]That's not my tagline.
[452:15.03]Somebody already has the Master of Comedy tagline.
[452:16.93]It's not me.
[452:21.43]But I do appreciate it.
[452:22.67]I really do.
[452:28.63]But thank you, June Opsetto, for the $250,000.
[452:31.80]Farting and crying, what?
[452:33.32]Yeah, people have no idea.
[452:37.42]You guys are going to be making references over the next few weeks about this, and there's going to be people that had nothing to do with that, weren't here at all, and they're going to be at least mildly confused as to what the fuck we're talking about.
[452:51.97]But it's all good.
[452:56.02]Too bad.
[452:59.46]Thank you, TheSamos, for the 10 bucks.
[453:04.75]Thank you for the $10.
[453:06.87]Hey, Jerma, thanks for the streams and all the fun times you share with your community.
[453:10.35]Since your YouTube days to now, you've never failed to make me laugh.
[453:14.46]Thanks for everything and all the great times.
[453:16.52]Also, for a game recommendation, consider Escape from Monkey Island.
[453:20.30]Thank you once again, and I intend to be a viewer for as long as I possibly can.
[453:26.69]I will I'm glad to have you for as long as you want to be here thank you much love to you and escape from monkey island that's the point and click game right what I was going to do batch these all up because I was going to try to do a week
[453:50.56]Pretty much like three or four streams in a week where I played a bunch of these.
[453:56.44]Do like a point and click week or something.
[454:02.16]Oh right, people don't even know the stream is over.
[454:06.88]Whoops, I forgot about that.
[454:10.45]This just says I'm playing Monster Rancher and there's like two fucking weirdos on the screen.

[455:37.06]Uh, Deus Morte, thanks for the $2.50.
[455:38.94]Hey, Jerma, purchased a $300 version of Adobe Photoshop to make this.
[455:44.10]Hope it was worth it.
[455:48.34]It's just... It's just... It's the crying face with my hair as a mustache.
[456:02.14]Ads.
[456:02.64]Not yet.

[456:08.62]Watch me doing this be, like, incredibly lucrative.
[456:21.20]$300 joke.
[456:22.68]You want to put it on stream?
[456:23.60]Alright, I'll put it on stream.
[456:30.27]Alright, so when we come back, you have to tell me what you got for ads.
[456:46.48]I wanna know if you get the same ad like five times in a row.
[456:55.15]So the subs don't get ads.
[457:02.03]What's the difference between a hippo and a zippo?
[457:04.01]One is really heavy, the other is a little lighter.
[457:07.18]Nice.
[457:08.50]Very nice.
[457:09.42]Good work.
[457:14.70]Turned off my ad blocker.
[457:16.40]Let's go.
[457:18.70]I can't believe there are people that are excited to get blasted with three minutes of ads.
[457:26.01]Subs don't get ads, right?
[457:27.15]Hold on.
[457:28.25]Let me change that real quick.
[457:31.61]No, I'm kidding.
[457:43.42]Incognito mode to get ads.
[457:46.16]What?
[457:54.96]Give us ads.
[457:55.96]I don't even know how to turn that on.
[457:59.44]I have no idea how to... I don't think I can fix that.
[458:01.72]Let's see, hold on.
[458:06.38]No, no, no, no, no.
[458:07.44]Guys, something like that, that's going to take like 36 hours for that to go through.
[458:14.03]That's not going to be... That's going to take some processing time for Twitch to do that.
[458:17.29]I don't think that's going to work.
[458:28.29]Better get started.
[458:30.97]Alright, here you go.
[458:32.73]You ready?
[458:38.48]I unsubbed to get ads.
[458:40.06]Oh my god, don't even.
[458:42.00]Don't even tell me that I'm gonna get like a mass exodus of subs.
[458:45.94]Alright, here come three minutes of ads, and we're gonna stay here.
[458:48.56]I want you to tell me what happened.
[458:51.57]Alright, three minutes.
[458:55.10]Okay, I'm gonna give fair warning to everybody here.
[458:57.55]This is happening now.
[458:59.21]If you don't want to see this bullshit, then you absolutely, completely, totally, understandably can leave.
[459:03.65]Just, thank you.
[459:05.04]See you in a couple days.
[459:07.02]Take care of yourself.
[459:07.94]See you soon.

[459:15.09]Get the popcorn.
[459:15.73]Here comes three minutes.
[459:24.62]Is it working?
[459:25.14]I don't even want to stay live for three more- What happens if I turn the stream off?
[459:36.50]I have to be- I have to stay live for three more minutes?
[459:42.43]What happens if I turn off the stream right now?
[459:49.61]Do they still get them?
[459:50.55]They still play?
[459:58.68]Pizza Hut off pizza Amazon Prime with commercial fortnight.
[460:05.84]Oh my god.
[460:06.62]This is so funny Everybody's so excited about this
[460:20.73]That was not three minutes.
[460:21.98]It's still going.
[460:22.70]You should be still getting... Red Sox Championship video ad.
[460:29.86]Nice.
[460:33.04]There's still apparently 106 seconds of ads still going.
[460:37.98]Maybe I broke it.
[460:51.93]It's still going.
[460:55.71]Vision 2?
[460:57.91]No, it shouldn't be over already.
[461:02.20]Somebody got two identical Division ads in a row.
[461:05.38]Good.
[461:06.12]That's good.
[461:17.99]I got Hellboy and Samsung.
[461:21.77]Why are we treating this like surprise eggs?
[461:24.83]What'd you get in yours?
[461:25.61]I got Hellboy, Verizon, and my time at Porsche.
[461:47.35]Hellboy.
[461:48.57]They're still going.
[461:49.53]People, watch, and
[461:52.19]In about 27 seconds, we're going to get a rush of people that just got out.
[461:56.79]Why are they tiered?
[461:57.95]That seems weird.
[462:11.10]You know, it's probably based by country, too.
[462:13.52]Maybe you don't get ads or you only get one or two from a certain country?
[462:17.34]Alright, three seconds, two, one.
[462:19.08]Here they come.
[462:20.60]How was it?
[462:22.69]How'd you guys do?
[462:28.40]Everybody should be out now.
[462:33.18]I got Fortnite.
[462:37.83]More.
[462:38.47]I... No.
[462:44.59]Oh yeah, you can still chat during ads.
[462:46.13]I forgot.
[462:46.39]It doesn't like turn you off.
[462:48.85]Why would it?
[462:52.95]Hey, Frosttro, thanks for the five dollars.
[462:56.55]Thanks for being the safest place on the internet for my mental health.
[463:01.25]Thank you.
[463:02.32]For the five bucks.
[463:08.30]Thanks for sticking around.
[463:11.22]We're glad to have you.
[463:12.36]Thank you.
[463:15.92]Weekend ad stream.
[463:18.24]So would Twitch just pull my stream and ban me?
[463:21.39]If I just had like a... If I just came back here every three minutes.
[463:25.09]No, it's every eight minutes.
[463:27.33]So if I turned on my stream, and it was just a webcam, and it was me just sitting there, and I ran three minutes of ads, and then I came back, I just like played with my phone for ten minutes, and then ran ads again.
[463:39.68]If I ran like 40 minutes of ads on like an eight-hour stream,
[463:46.91]Would that be a problem?
[463:50.56]I mean, that would kill my channel, but... I just sit there for like eight minutes.
[464:00.06]Run three minutes, sit there for eight minutes, run three minutes.
[464:14.09]Chat wants to give you free money by ads.
[464:20.98]He's contemplating it.
[464:22.56]No, I mean, if, like, if... If you guys really want me to do this at the end of the streams, right?
[464:34.28]I'm not gonna do it every time.
[464:41.34]Like, right at the very end, like, never during a stream.
[464:48.23]I don't know if I would ever do it.
[464:56.47]My mic's muted?
[464:57.25]Oh, please.
[465:00.13]End of the stream joke.
[465:02.71]We'll see.
[465:03.29]I don't know.
[465:03.82]We'll see.
[465:06.66]I don't want to, like, turn you guys into, like, money printers for the last five minutes of a stream.
[465:12.02]Like, sit there and watch five minutes of ads.
[465:19.05]But...
[465:23.68]Have people in chat make fake ad videos and play one.
[465:32.43]The only way I would ever do that is if it was actually at the end of all the bits, all the sub-credits, just literally the very end before the stream turns off.
[465:40.65]That's the only time I would ever do that.
[465:48.40]But.
[465:50.10]That's going to be it.
[465:50.62]I'll see you guys in a couple days.
[465:51.44]Hey, Skelly!
[465:53.58]Skelly Boner.
[465:55.28]Thanks for the $5.
[465:55.66]Hey, Jeremiah, I took the day off for stress and depression reasons.
[465:59.41]And this absolutely made my day.
[466:00.77]What a wonderful stream.
[466:06.05]Thank you for the $5, Skelly.
[466:10.80]Hopefully on your day off, you can relax a little.
[466:16.42]Thank you for sticking around here.
[466:20.53]Glad... As a community.
[466:26.03]We can keep company, make you laugh.
[466:29.27]Thank you.
[466:32.03]Use ads as a means to punish chat.
[466:34.05]I don't know about that.
[466:36.35]But that's my time.
[466:37.03]I'll see you guys soon.
[466:38.91]Couple days.
[466:41.03]We'll take a crack at the... Probably the Risk of Rain 2 stuff with Etalyx, probably.
[466:51.36]Have a great rest of your night.
[466:55.09]Wait, did I miss somebody's bits?
[466:56.15]Whose bits did I miss?
[466:57.53]Oh, Juno Upsetto.
[466:59.49]Thank you for the $2.50, Juno Upsetto.
[467:00.89]Right at the very end here.
[467:02.79]And they say, ooh, it's taken over.
[467:04.67]There's no escape.
[467:05.43]You better get moving.
[467:06.67]Ready or not get ready.
[467:08.39]What is that?
[467:12.28]Is that from the... Oh, it's probably from one of the ads.
[467:18.30]Take care, guys.
[467:20.40]See you in a couple days for probably Risk of Rain 2.
[467:23.22]And then we'll return to Monster Rancher to continue this.
[467:27.52]And then we will do the Sekiro Scratch-Off stream and the Jerma Slot video game.
[467:39.33]See you soon.
[467:40.09]Take care.
[467:41.37]And goodbye.
