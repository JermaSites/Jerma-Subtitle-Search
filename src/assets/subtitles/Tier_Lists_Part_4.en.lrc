[00:02.16]Alright, I need to have my Chrome.
[00:04.12]Google Chrome, look at that.
[00:14.45]Give me one second.
[00:15.95]Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[00:25.56]Turn on cam, turn on cam, turn on cam, turn on cam.
[00:29.35]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:32.59]I have to change to just chatting too.
[00:36.49]Where the heck?
[00:38.09]And I gotta have music too.
[00:39.63]I can't just sit here silent.
[00:41.21]We need like a music.
[00:44.77]I'll turn the camera on, but just not right there.
[00:46.13]I need music.
[00:50.57]Face cam, please.
[00:51.19]I'm gonna put it on.
[00:52.01]I'm very sweaty though.
[00:56.21]Okay, let's do this.
[00:57.27]Condiments and sauces.
[00:58.45]Okay, and then World of Warcraft expansions.
[01:09.11]This one's going to be really fun.
[01:11.51]I can't wait to do this one.
[01:14.57]What's this?
[01:15.59]What's this YouTube link?
[01:18.79]Why did I just click that?
[01:21.78]Why would I click the first link in chat?
[01:23.22]What am I, insane?
[01:30.79]I'm not playing Joel's 3D Movie Maker movie for background noise.
[01:35.83]I want to watch it on the video stream.
[01:40.05]That's not music.
[01:40.87]What's this?
[01:51.19]This is the same one.
[01:53.93]I'm just going to put it on my own.
[01:55.30]Okay, how about...
[01:59.96]No, I'm not watching it.
[02:00.78]No, we're going to watch it during the watch movies stream.
[02:04.27]Because that's a movie.
[02:08.63]It'll be in between two public domain movies.
[02:13.67]Alright, what do I want to listen to?
[02:17.18]How about... I don't know.
[02:20.18]What the fuck do I want to listen to?
[02:21.28]Alright, let's go back to here.
[02:34.98]Oh no, it's, oh shit, my shit's broken.
[02:48.15]Can I do this?
[02:51.53]Okay.
[02:52.57]Let's get that window.
[02:56.63]Window capture.
[02:58.77]Uh-huh.
[03:02.41]Okay.
[03:06.80]Oh no, Jeremy, your stream.
[03:09.64]It's alright.
[03:10.38]It'll be fine.
[03:10.86]Don't worry, everybody relax.
[03:20.89]Where is it?
[03:24.91]Condiments and tier lists.
[03:29.45]Let's shrink this.
[03:33.10]Shrink that so we can see it better.
[03:41.74]I'll put my camera up here.
[03:44.92]I look wicked ugly.
[03:46.80]No, I don't.
[03:47.26]I look pretty handsome.
[03:57.58]Okay.
[03:58.38]Let's take a look.
[03:59.76]How do I look right now?
[04:01.64]I thought I had some stains on my shirt, but what am I going to do?
[04:07.44]Can you see me?
[04:10.66]Why is the camera so big?
[04:12.00]Oh, right.
[04:12.43]I was doing that.
[04:13.09]Thank you.
[04:13.47]Look at how big.
[04:14.13]Oh, hi guys.
[04:21.01]I know I'm out of sync.
[04:21.77]Hold on.
[04:24.96]There we go.
[04:30.12]Wait, let me apply.
[04:30.84]No, who cares?
[04:33.18]Alright.
[04:35.77]So.
[04:41.50]Let's go.
[04:46.10]Jerma lied about wicked ugly.
[04:49.83]Uh... I'm gonna say... First of all, let's add... Actually, no, this is just D is just D. Alrighty, off the bat.
[04:59.49]I'm not even in just chatting.
[05:01.77]How do I change that?
[05:02.45]Hold on, can I... First close this.
[05:10.52]What the fuck am I doing?
[05:15.96]just chatting just how about just tears I mean that's what we're doing that looks good tears we're in the right category I gotta get a haircut too thanks for reminding me alright so
[05:45.87]We've got srirachas.
[05:48.13]I hate it.
[05:49.99]Honey.
[05:51.93]Let's put honey and bee for now.
[05:54.33]I didn't even put on any music either.
[05:59.62]It'll come later.
[06:01.18]Mayonnaise.
[06:01.96]But the thing is about mayonnaise, I don't put it on everything.
[06:06.56]I only put it on some stuff.
[06:15.22]This just hurts.
[06:17.40]When something hurts to eat it, I don't want it.
[06:21.86]This is mayonnaise, right?
[06:22.84]Okay.
[06:24.11]Ranch.
[06:24.47]I think ranch is overrated, but I still like it.
[06:37.25]I have not made my decision.
[06:38.27]Honey is in B. Hold on.
[06:39.72]I'm just getting it up here.
[06:42.14]I'm not ready yet.
[06:44.18]Hummus is somewhere between A and S. I lived off that stuff in college.
[06:51.78]Tomato like pizza sauce?
[06:55.52]Why is there like tomato sauce?
[06:57.24]Is it like spaghetti?
[06:58.16]This is pesto.
[07:06.26]It's okay.
[07:08.56]This is Dijon mustard.
[07:11.26]I'm just getting it up there.
[07:13.56]This is barbecue sauce.
[07:16.91]Hold on.
[07:17.45]Keep it in B. Tartar sauce.
[07:19.61]B. Frank's Red Hot is the worst condiment in the world.
[07:26.76]It is absolutely fucking revolting.
[07:32.79]It does not know what it wants to be.
[07:35.21]It so desperately wants to be a hot sauce, but it just tastes like buttery, gross liquid.
[07:41.46]It's just, it's like that hot flavor.
[07:45.52]Right?
[07:46.22]No, it's awful.
[07:50.26]It's hot sauce that's not hot.
[07:52.15]It's just like the buffalo flavor.
[07:57.15]That's the worst one in the whole list.
[07:58.85]So I would eat sriracha five times before I had Frank's once.
[08:06.38]Just regular default yellow mustard.
[08:08.06]I like Dijon better.
[08:14.14]Thousand Island is alright.
[08:16.04]Ketchup is good, but I'm going to have a lot of B's.
[08:20.91]Jack Daniels?
[08:25.65]Just Jack Daniels barbecue sauce?
[08:27.63]Or just drinking Jack Daniels?
[08:31.79]Honey mustard, that goes up here.
[08:34.31]This is guacamole.
[08:35.19]Guacamole really depends on what kind of guacamole and who made it.
[08:39.05]Because guacamole can be down here or guacamole can be up here.
[08:42.96]So I'm going to take the average and I'm going to say somewhere around here.
[08:47.76]Like here.
[08:51.60]Okay, now... Salsa is S. I eat salsa all the fucking time.
[08:56.61]I love salsa.
[08:59.27]It's... Yeah.
[09:02.72]Salsa's one of the only things you could just eat every day and probably not care and not get sick of it.
[09:10.50]That and... Is that Cholula?
[09:14.15]Cholula's good.
[09:18.39]Cholula's better than Sriracha.
[09:21.23]In my opinion, I'd have to say that.
[09:25.48]Is it better than Guacamole?
[09:26.78]This is not even done.
[09:31.10]This is not even correct.
[09:31.80]This is not accurate.
[09:32.42]Maple syrup.
[09:35.32]A. What is this?
[09:38.07]Relish.
[09:41.13]And then this is Worcestershire sauce.
[09:44.75]I don't put it on anything.
[09:45.99]Alright.
[09:46.31]Let me.
[09:47.37]Okay.
[09:47.75]I need music.
[09:49.51]Give me music.
[09:50.95]Turn that camera off first.
[09:56.45]You marinate.
[09:57.05]Yeah, but it's not.
[09:57.79]Is that a condiment?
[10:03.04]Oh, it's soy sauce!
[10:05.06]Right, okay.
[10:06.02]If it's soy sauce... I don't like it.
[10:10.43]I actually really don't like soy sauce at all.
[10:12.33]I'm so- I know, people are getting mad about that.
[10:14.13]It's not that far down, though.
[10:15.39]It's- I would rather have soy sauce than, like, Jack Daniel's fucking garbage can barbecue sauce.
[10:24.23]Um... Alright, I need music.
[10:26.57]Just chill music.
[10:32.07]Chill out music.
[10:43.55]I did click on the first one, which means... Is this point your camera out the window airplane vlog?
[10:52.53]I don't know.
[10:52.99]Is it?
[10:53.19]This is like a regular song.
[11:04.95]Chill step.
[11:05.69]There's something called chill step?
[11:12.33]What is that genre?
[11:16.91]I like this.
[11:17.31]This is fine.
[11:17.81]This can stay.
[11:22.77]I'm back.
[11:25.83]So let me narrow this down.
[11:30.78]Honey should be up here.
[11:33.33]pesto is good for three bites and then you start it's just be you hate it seriously like the first two or three bites of something with pesto on it you go holy that's incredible and then after that you do like I don't want to eat this anymore I would definitely rather have tomato sauce on something than ranch
[12:03.11]I would never eat this.
[12:07.03]No, I would never eat that.
[12:08.85]Ever.
[12:15.93]Pesto is a condiment for an obese college student.
[12:20.26]What?
[12:21.98]Hold on, I gotta fix my Lego hair.
[12:23.58]It's a little better.
[12:28.54]Tartar sauce is not better than barbecue sauce, it's good.
[12:44.37]It's close.
[12:45.09]It's really close.
[12:45.87]I'm trying to figure out if this is S or A. They're both S. Would I rather, like... No, sausage is S. Sausage complete S. Honey's better than Thomas.
[13:01.78]I have a rule that I cannot have more than two or three S's, so otherwise... Like, what the hell do you think you're doing?
[13:22.39]Oh, I would use both of them.
[13:25.28]Ketchup is better than mustard.
[13:26.92]I'm talking regular, just yellow mustard.
[13:35.44]I think I'm good.
[13:35.90]I think this is it.
[13:43.71]No, it's not true.
[13:45.57]I'm done!
[13:49.27]Why is soy so low?
[13:50.99]I just... I don't know.
[13:52.95]I don't like it.
[13:53.43]It just tastes... It just tastes like salty, dirty water to me.
[14:03.47]I know.
[14:04.26]Everybody hates me now.
[14:05.56]I know.
[14:08.10]But I... Look, it's not... I would still eat it.
[14:11.94]I would still like it.
[14:13.06]I wouldn't mind it if it was a part of something.
[14:14.72]If it was on something already...
[14:16.82]But adding soy sauce is just like salt water.
[14:20.03]It's just like, it's like taking a, you're dipping a cup in the ocean and like sipping the cup.
[14:24.89]It's just like salt bomb.
[14:28.35]If it's on something and I'm dipping like sushi in it, that's pretty good.
[14:31.79]But honey is gross.
[14:34.92]Well, we have different opinions and I'm happy about that.
[14:39.80]Hey, I like soy sauce more than I like relish.
[14:45.24]In fact, that's not fair because I would rather have this than... Now it's ready.
[14:54.21]I'd rather have Cholula than soy sauce.
[14:55.83]I'd rather have tomato sauce than soy sauce.
[14:58.31]I'd rather have guacamole than soy sauce.
[14:59.89]I'd rather have... This is not true.
[15:04.50]That's completely untrue.
[15:05.80]I actually would not... I would rather have soy sauce than pesto.
[15:09.28]No, I wouldn't.
[15:15.60]Guacamole, no.
[15:18.56]Okay, I'm done.
[15:21.52]Uh, Joel just... Joel... Just raided me.
[15:25.77]What's up, Joel?
[15:29.89]Your movie was fucking sick!
[15:33.37]I saw your movie, it was fucking sick!
[15:40.54]My favorite part is when...
[15:43.91]I mean, liar.
[15:44.93]Liar.
[15:46.13]Don't mess around like that.
[15:52.65]Joel, what do you think of my list?
[15:54.95]And those viewers that came from Joel.
[15:55.97]What do you think of this list?
[15:57.78]Joel.
[16:00.06]Mayonnaise, right?
[16:03.16]It's an English thing.
[16:06.00]Joel's not from England.
[16:07.98]Don't know even why I said that.
[16:10.70]Not even close.
[16:12.62]From the same continent.
[16:17.46]Okay.
[16:23.85]It's in English.
[16:24.77]That's a European thing.
[16:26.83]That's what I was told.
[16:34.61]I told the fries and... I almost said a oregano.
[16:39.72]Fries and mayonnaise is a European thing.
[16:43.75]Joel, please.
[16:46.01]Quantify this.
[16:51.72]Mayo on fries is definitely a European thing.
[16:53.62]Joel, do you do this?
[16:59.32]Joel, I'm not going to move on until you answer me!
[17:18.50]He's not even here.
[17:19.18]I got long-ass fingernails.
[17:25.76]Uh, he's not even here.
[17:26.56]He's not here.
[17:29.54]Oh, well, thanks for the... No, really, thanks for the host or the raid, whatever it was.
[17:32.48]I hope you guys had a fun time.
[17:34.18]He did respond.
[17:35.52]Thank you, Dad, for the 10 community subs.
[17:38.18]We got him.
[17:38.56]Oh, yeah, World of Warcraft expansions.
[17:40.12]Right, that's the other one.
[17:43.68]Here we go.
[17:44.88]Ready?
[17:45.38]I'll do this with my eyes closed.
[17:48.80]I think I'm probably gonna get it right let me just see where they are like no I didn't have to look at I okay World of Warcraft expansion tier list and just game tier list I'm not even paying attention I don't even know what I'm looking at where okay where where where are we where's burning crusade where's burning crusade
[18:26.99]fast as lightning the panda is in a no no no no no it's not uh this is where the game started to be bad this I remember I remember I remember loading up World of Warcraft during that expansion and playing for like six hours and going this is the this game's not fun anymore that's where I started to stop playing
[18:52.99]Then, you're probably wondering, Jermo, what the fuck is Legion doing?
[18:56.93]I think Legion was the best, like, the best expansion that came out recently in the last, like, 10 years.
[19:03.74]How long?
[19:04.16]Well, this is two expansions ago, right?
[19:07.40]Legion brought me back to the game, and I thought it was really, really, really great.
[19:11.78]Not as good as that when you first played on Classic.
[19:14.05]Wrath of the Lich King, best expansion pack.
[19:16.45]I think that's not an unpopular opinion in Burning Crusade in very close seconds.
[19:22.85]These were so awful, I'm going to give them a mention.
[19:28.23]I'm not even sure if this is even the right one, but I know it's not one of these.
[19:31.65]So it belongs down here.
[19:38.75]Alright.
[19:39.61]Any more?
[19:41.37]Official TF2 maps.
[19:42.95]You want me to do TF2 maps?
[19:45.66]Chex Mix.
[19:48.20]I don't think I can do the TF2 maps.
[19:49.44]It's been a long time.
[19:52.18]Why can I not?
[19:53.76]Computers are so bad.
[19:54.64]I can't even right-click in the chat that's in Streamlabs OBS.
[20:01.69]Have I said anything good about Streamlabs OBS?
[20:03.81]Why do I still use it?
[20:07.84]Is there a reason why I'm still using this?
[20:11.86]This is free.
[20:12.98]No, I'm not talking about... Yeah, I guess.
[20:17.86]There's so many maps in TF2.
[20:19.26]This is gonna... I don't know if I can... I might have to do... This is gonna be sloppy.
[20:27.41]Not using XSplit.
[20:28.21]I tried to use XSplit.
[20:29.05]It's way worse.
[20:31.65]And you have to pay for XSplit.
[20:35.38]Remember, JetBlue is the only company I like.
[20:36.98]Alright, where was it?
[20:42.38]TF2 maps.
[20:46.67]Let me see it again.
[20:49.11]Fullmetal Alchemist characters.
[20:53.95]Alright, let's do Chex Mix.
[20:58.82]God fucking dammit, give me a break.
[21:01.70]Uh, Chex Mix.
[21:07.08]Okay.
[21:37.15]Checks are gross.
[21:39.59]They're not good.
[21:40.35]They're very bad.
[21:43.53]Now I'm done.
[21:48.90]This has to be a generational change thing.
[21:54.38]You ate around the checks when I was younger.
[21:57.36]You didn't eat the checks.
[21:59.65]It's like, just... Do Fullmetal Alchemist.
[22:03.23]Why do you want me to do Fullmetal Alchemist?
[22:06.93]Call of Duty games?
[22:07.85]I've played three of them.
[22:08.88]I can't do this one.
[22:12.86]Official TF2 maps.
[22:14.78]Why not?
[22:15.16]Let's do this one.
[22:15.96]This sounds like interesting for a little bit.
[22:24.80]Oh my god.
[22:27.06]I'm kind of getting into the weeds here.
[22:32.15]At least 5 CP or... Okay.
[22:37.61]No opinion.
[22:38.09]I don't have any opinion.
[22:40.03]Manpower?
[22:40.91]No, no, no, no.
[22:43.85]Thunder Mountain Manpower.
[22:45.31]What does that mean?
[22:51.70]Tubertown?
[22:53.77]Thunder Mountain Manpower.
[22:54.93]It's just Thunder Mountain.
[23:02.81]Okay.
[23:04.75]I don't remember.
[23:05.36]Hydro.
[23:06.02]F. Doomsday.
[23:10.40]F. Snowplow.
[23:13.34]I actually kind of remember this being... Okay.
[23:16.26]Upward.
[23:19.42]Did I have more fun on Gorge or Upward?
[23:27.01]That's accurate.
[23:28.49]Nah, I love Gorge.
[23:29.81]Attack-Defend Gorge is like the best map they've ever made.
[23:31.96]I love Gorge so much.
[23:35.68]Where's Dustbowl?
[23:37.48]Yeah, call me a loser.
[23:38.66]Call me like an idiot.
[23:40.86]That's fine.
[23:41.87]That's one of my favorite maps.
[23:42.77]Original Team Fortress.
[23:44.05]Those of you that played TF Plastic, you'll understand.
[23:48.19]This is Team Fortress 2, I know.
[23:49.17]Badwater is up there, but it's okay.
[23:51.98]It's okay.
[23:54.50]Nightfall.
[23:55.50]Banana Bay.
[23:55.98]Don't know.
[23:57.50]Two Forward Invasion.
[23:58.38]I played it like once or twice.
[24:00.46]Barn Blitz.
[24:01.10]Get up there.
[24:03.50]At least a B. It's an A. No, it's not.
[24:08.71]Probed.
[24:09.13]I don't know.
[24:10.09]Frontier.
[24:10.77]Get up there.
[24:14.29]Frontier is not better than Badwater.
[24:15.89]Yes, it is.
[24:16.55]It's better than Badwater.
[24:17.63]Better than Barn Blitz.
[24:19.09]Um...
[24:21.61]VI- this is not fair though because this is different game modes.
[24:26.85]Like, I think Viaduct is awesome, but I don't know if I would put Viaduct in the same category as like... Upward.
[24:34.32]You know what I mean?
[24:34.76]They're like completely different game modes.
[24:38.62]That's just tricky.
[24:39.72]This is not accurate.
[24:44.44]I'll keep doing it though.
[24:45.35]Um...
[24:49.59]I know a lot of people that play comp are going to hate my guts, but I really don't like any of the comp maps.
[25:01.08]I really don't like them that much.
[25:02.45]I just don't.
[25:13.95]Two forts sucks, but it's fun just to snipe.
[25:18.46]Granary's not that low.
[25:19.91]I know, but Lakeside, I love Lakeside, but not how much, though.
[25:23.11]Not that much.
[25:23.61]I've never been to Brazil.
[25:26.83]Snowy Coast.
[25:27.73]It's taken me a while to remember these, though.
[25:29.35]Snakewater?
[25:30.21]No.
[25:32.05]Wait, Snakewater was... No, that's Badlands.
[25:43.26]Powerhouse?
[25:44.00]Well, no, I don't... Where's the one that I really don't like?
[25:52.30]There's Harvest.
[25:54.40]Yes, can you tell?
[25:55.34]I just played a Harvest for like six hours straight, like three days a week.
[26:02.73]I just like... What do you... Oh, there it is.
[26:09.91]What did I just do?
[26:10.49]Attack Defend Gorge.
[26:11.51]There it is.
[26:12.81]Sawmill, sawmill, sawmill.
[26:14.55]Sawmill's good.
[26:18.10]But I don't know if I would put Sawmill up where Nucleus is.
[26:23.33]I really don't think so.
[26:26.91]Egypt.
[26:28.15]Awful.
[26:31.13]King of the Hill Badlands.
[26:32.17]Do I remember playing this?
[26:36.45]Where's the... Where's the... Where is it?
[26:41.33]Not Junction.
[26:42.97]It was one of the fairly newer ones right before I stopped playing.
[26:47.73]Is this Payload Thunder Mountain?
[26:48.89]Yeah.
[26:49.27]Get this out of here.
[26:49.93]Manpower.
[26:54.63]What was it called?
[26:59.57]Was it Borneo?
[27:00.43]I think it was Borneo.
[27:01.75]I really liked this one, if I'm remembering correctly.
[27:05.45]This is the one where it turns the corner and there's always a sentry in the little house?
[27:12.94]Yeah, this one's great.
[27:16.52]Mm-hmm.
[27:19.21]I was that guy.
[27:20.09]I was the one doing the sentry in the little house.
[27:25.97]It worked every time.
[27:26.67]What a great game.
[27:31.85]This game's so good.
[27:33.77]Why can nothing ever replace this?
[27:42.88]No, I didn't really like the sawmill map.
[27:46.31]I don't know what Watergate is.
[27:47.37]I think these are Man vs Machine maps.
[27:50.81]I don't know an opinion on it, really.
[27:54.84]Kong King was not very good.
[27:57.60]I really don't like Kong King.
[28:03.56]People are going to hate me for this one.
[28:04.68]I actually really like Turbine.
[28:07.26]It's a mess.
[28:13.83]Well, I don't really like it.
[28:14.73]I like it enough.
[28:19.90]Mercenary Park.
[28:23.36]Lazarus.
[28:25.99]Pipeline.
[28:26.57]I remember Pipeline.
[28:27.39]Where's the one that never ends?
[28:28.85]Where's Hightower?
[28:33.53]There it is.
[28:33.97]Okay.
[28:35.87]Hightower also comes up a little bit higher than Turbine, for sure.
[28:42.84]New maps are good.
[28:45.38]Timbertown.
[28:49.05]Oh, I really hated steal.
[28:51.91]I remember every time it would change to steal, I would instantly hit cancel.
[28:54.85]I'd spam, spam, spam, because the game, whenever it was loading, you couldn't do anything.
[28:59.79]And I remember just trying desperately to make sure I hit cancel so I could go back to the service screen.
[29:05.72]Every time.
[29:08.34]Process was okay.
[29:11.88]I don't remember it enough, though.
[29:16.12]How could I forget this?
[29:21.70]I love hoodoo high pass Manhattan digroot keep was it's better than steel and it's better than yeah it's not I think it's better than kong king though too gimmicky junction don't like it at all better than steel though and better than digroot keep vanguard I don't powerhouse I don't I've played it but I don't not enough
[29:48.84]What's the one with the two that cross in the middle?
[29:51.80]The payload war.
[29:54.56]Is that Nightfall?
[29:58.22]That's Nightfall, right?
[30:05.29]Better than Granary.
[30:06.75]I had fun on it.
[30:07.41]Same with Pipeline.
[30:08.05]I don't remember which one I like more.
[30:10.25]A lot of you are waiting for this one.
[30:19.77]I have days and days, probably dozens and dozens and dozens of days played on Gold Rush.
[30:28.47]So much time just doing the same thing, but it was so fun.
[30:34.99]That's the thing with Team Fortress 2 that no game since has been able to do.
[30:39.18]And that's doing the same fucking thing every time you play was always fun because there were so many variables in the game.
[30:51.13]To make it so it didn't matter that the same goal was happening.
[30:53.87]There was so many things happening inside of that game.
[31:00.69]Nobody's been able to do it since.
[31:03.57]That's sad music.
[31:05.07]Well, it should be.
[31:11.31]Building a sentry in TF2 in the same spot in Gold Rush.
[31:15.90]I know where it is.
[31:16.50]I can see it.
[31:18.41]hundreds of times every single time was fun every time that's not the same for other games even when Overwatch came out and I played Overwatch
[31:38.42]The thing that really grabbed me in Overwatch that I really, really liked, I thought it was really, really awesome, was the pig guy.
[31:48.14]What was his name?
[31:50.32]Hogwash?
[31:50.88]What's the guy's name?
[31:54.26]Roadhog.
[31:56.63]The chain.
[31:58.35]was a... I loved it.
[32:00.04]I loved it.
[32:00.70]I loved the chain so much.
[32:02.16]And Zenyatta's orbs.
[32:04.22]Putting the healing orb on people and the chain were those do it every single time, do it every single game, and it's always fun.
[32:12.78]But it was the only two things that I really can pull out that I thought were that fun.
[32:17.17]And maybe running around as Lúcio.
[32:23.43]But something about the maps and how messy it got.
[32:25.85]It got real messy.
[32:26.85]TF2 got messy.
[32:29.81]but not like shields and everywhere and there's a million people it's like less people but more bullshit it's just kind of hard to look at sometimes
[32:48.39]You could have 30 people in a TF2 server, and you would still almost be at the crest of the amount of just weird bullshit on the screen that happens with one 5v5 Overwatch match.
[33:05.04]Nobody's been able to really come that close.
[33:08.06]Overwatch was really damn close, though.
[33:10.90]I had a lot of fun playing the first four or five months of that game.
[33:14.16]I really did.
[33:16.50]But...
[33:18.33]just didn't hold me it held me for about six months and then I was like ah like but that's still I mean in the grand scheme of things playing a game for like four or five six months straight I mean that's that's pretty good I would have loved to have it hold me forever helped me for about three four months same yeah
[33:45.54]think that's really what it comes down to that's wrong with Overwatch there's only 12 people in an Overwatch game but there's 10 times more than having 60 people be in a TF2 game I mean they like valve you can make fun of valve and as much as you want but they they took almost a decade to make this game changing things redoing things they took almost 10 years to make this so it had everything they wanted
[34:14.41]Classics will always remain timeless.
[34:17.87]Yeah.
[34:21.95]TF2 is probably the last game that I really, really wanted to play every day.
[34:28.15]Feels bad, man.
[34:30.25]Feels bad, man.
[34:36.25]Because now this stuff holds my... Pay no attention to that.
[34:42.81]Stuff holds my attention now.
[34:44.87]Like, I'm sure a lot of you can agree.
[34:47.43]But I'm not into the... I'm really not into VR at all.
[34:50.81]And that's what's currently, like, holding a bunch of people's attention, is, uh, like, stuff like Fortnite, Apex, the Call of Duty stuff.
[34:57.04]I just don't... It just doesn't do it for me.
[35:00.62]Same thing with MOBAs, too.
[35:01.80]Smite was probably the last one that I thought was actually pretty fun.
[35:05.64]But, like, beta Smite, and, like, maybe just barely after release Smite was awesome.
[35:11.57]And then I, I don't know, I wasn't really into it after a while.
[35:13.63]Same deal, like another, like, four to six months and that was it.
[35:16.49]I gave up on it.
[35:21.83]Beta Smite was perfect.
[35:24.43]It was so good.
[35:27.53]BR is just temporary fad.
[35:28.83]It will die in the next few years.
[35:30.07]I'm not so sure about that.
[35:31.77]People were saying that when...
[35:34.93]Stuff like DayZ was kind of getting to be really popular.
[35:38.93]And they were like, ah, this is just a fad.
[35:41.19]This will be gone in a few years.
[35:43.00]And then Fortnite is still huge.
[35:47.44]PUBG?
[35:47.94]Yeah, PUBG came after DayZ.
[35:53.63]I wish I liked those games.
[35:54.89]I really do.
[35:55.51]Because I would be playing them.
[35:59.84]And like I said, the Counter-Strike is always going to be around.
[36:02.56]CSGO is just always going to be popular.
[36:04.40]It's a high kind of skill ceiling team FPS.
[36:08.09]I mean, people love CSGO.
[36:10.59]I just, not for me.
[36:15.23]Ever played Tribes Ascend?
[36:16.41]Yes, it was fantastic.
[36:20.31]Hi-Rez did this really, really great job on the first, like, six months of their games being released.
[36:28.95]And then they kind of didn't, they went to shit.
[36:33.18]The first, like, four to six months of Tribes Ascend, what an un-fucking-believable experience.
[36:38.42]The first, like, four to six months of Smite, what an un-fucking-believable experience.
[36:48.32]I think that Hi-Rez has made, like, just base video game, has made some of the better video games in the last decade.
[36:59.39]Like, just straight up, just like, Tribes Ascend as a video game.
[37:05.04]Forget about, like, any patches of what they did, but, like, when that first released, it was amazing.
[37:15.01]Video game.
[37:15.68]Video game.
[37:16.32]Video game.
[37:17.42]When they made a video game.
[37:18.70]Alright, I gotta get back to this.
[37:23.04]Hi-Rez abandoned their games.
[37:25.57]I don't think that... No, they didn't.
[37:26.97]They just focused on other stuff.
[37:28.75]They kind of spread themselves out.
[37:30.27]Focused on the new thing.
[37:31.15]Focused on the new thing.
[37:40.71]Well, yeah, tribes.
[37:42.19]Yeah, you're right.
[37:42.99]They did.
[37:43.57]They kind of just gave up on tribes.
[37:46.13]They actually abandoned tribes yesterday.
[37:55.97]If tribes got the same kind of TF2 treatment, I would probably still be playing it.
[38:02.96]Anyways, let's continue.
[38:11.10]Dirty Bomb?
[38:11.62]I actually never played Dirty Bomb.
[38:14.07]Maybe for, like, a... No, I never played Dirty Bomb.
[38:16.39]I remember.
[38:16.89]I couldn't install it.
[38:20.13]What happened?
[38:20.81]Some of you guys might remember this.
[38:22.15]This was on stream.
[38:23.57]Like, six years ago.
[38:26.54]What happened?
[38:27.24]Remember?
[38:28.00]Who was around for that?
[38:29.96]I tried to play it.
[38:30.64]I got, like, locked out.
[38:32.06]I couldn't install it.
[38:36.08]Me and Star were playing it.
[38:37.08]Like, he was playing it.
[38:38.18]I was just watching because I couldn't install it.
[38:45.24]You made a meme during Starz video about what a shitty dream playing Dirty Bomb would be.
[38:55.47]I don't remember.
[38:56.05]I don't remember.
[38:59.05]I never played Lawbreakers, no.
[39:03.53]Because I saw the writing on the wall with Lawbreakers from the second they announced it.
[39:09.88]I knew if I got into it that the thing was just going to be dead anyways.
[39:13.06]Like, I just knew I could see it from a mile away.
[39:17.08]That first gameplay trailer, I was like, that's probably going to be a failure.
[39:21.84]But I'm not going to invest into that.
[39:29.66]Because if you do, let's say you invest a shitload of time into a game.
[39:32.04]This is not to say I don't think the game was any good.
[39:34.74]I don't have an opinion.
[39:35.78]I can't have an opinion on it because I didn't play it.
[39:38.45]But if you really liked Lawbreakers, you were a huge fan of Lawbreakers.
[39:45.40]That gotta hurt.
[39:46.90]If you were one of the people that, like, really cared about that game.
[39:51.36]And you put a bunch of time into it.
[39:53.67]And you played a bunch of it.
[39:54.87]And then they're just like, yeah, that's it.
[39:56.77]Like, oh.
[39:58.53]Well, fuck, I really liked this.
[40:02.21]Halo will be on PC in two weeks.
[40:03.65]That's another thing to be excited for.
[40:06.61]If you were one of the 19 players.
[40:07.99]That's mean.
[40:09.81]That's mean.
[40:11.15]Oh, Joel's in the chat?
[40:13.14]Joel's in the chat.
[40:14.64]What's up, Joel?
[40:15.54]What do you... What do you got?
[40:16.76]You got something for me?
[40:18.34]Huh?
[40:21.46]Hmm.
[40:27.20]Why are you not VIP'd?
[40:28.88]So I can, like, see what you're writing.
[40:32.19]VIP... Varg... Skelethor.
[40:39.85]That's correct, right?
[40:40.41]Hmm.
[40:43.80]Varg Skelethor.
[40:45.82]Alright, what's up?
[40:57.04]Would you be up for playing Tribes Ascend with our viewers?
[41:00.28]Let's revive it, man.
[41:01.28]We have the power.
[41:07.78]Is the game still turned on?
[41:13.95]The switch is still on in that game, is it?
[41:20.76]Yeah, is it?
[41:22.34]Did they turn off the servers?
[41:23.94]Why do I feel like they did?
[41:34.47]I would play Tribes.
[41:37.09]What's your schedule look like?
[41:41.43]It's unlisted on Steam.
[41:45.96]Is it unlisted?
[41:47.40]I think you have to get it right from Hi-Rez, right?
[41:57.62]Play Titanfall 2 instead.
[42:03.25]Hey, DM me on Discord.
[42:04.93]We'll talk about it.
[42:11.29]Titanfall 2 is good.
[42:13.97]Titanfall 2 campaign.
[42:15.93]What, you want to do the Titanfall 2 co-op campaign?
[42:20.91]Does that exist?
[42:24.58]That doesn't exist, right?
[42:31.58]There's no co-op.
[42:34.38]Oh, the game sucks then.
[42:36.66]Alright, let me finish this up.
[42:37.74]But hit me up.
[42:38.54]I'll message you on Discord.
[42:39.48]I also heard you watched my 3D Movie Maker thing.
[42:41.42]It was fucking fantastic.
[42:44.07]Seriously.
[42:45.63]It was fucking great.
[42:46.77]I loved every second of it.
[42:50.23]When we watch it in the future, I will.
[42:57.82]What better time to watch Joel's movie than when he's here?
[43:02.02]No, no, no, no.
[43:03.68]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[43:07.80]Joel, he's got to go.
[43:08.66]He just said he had to leave.
[43:09.66]Joel, what, you got an appointment?
[43:13.82]He just said in the chat, I've got an appointment I have to get to.
[43:17.36]I need to respect that.
[43:26.42]What's a ping like from Sweden to Nevada?
[43:35.10]Yes, my appointment at 4am.
[43:36.50]See?
[43:40.16]Can we even play games together?
[43:43.07]Oh, we're gonna have like 700 ping.
[43:44.11]It's alright.
[43:49.57]You can host.
[43:50.85]I'll take the disadvantage.
[43:53.47]You know what I mean?
[43:55.17]Madagascar Lion.
[43:56.29]Move.
[43:56.53]Alright.
[43:59.11]Fast Lane.
[43:59.75]I don't know.
[44:01.29]Surgeon.
[44:01.65]I don't know.
[44:02.93]Swift Water.
[44:03.57]Pretty good.
[44:07.64]Double Cross.
[44:08.48]Not good.
[44:10.94]Foundry.
[44:11.52]Don't like it.
[44:13.80]But not... Yeah, it's actually... Everything's better than Steel, so... Cold Front?
[44:20.77]Yeah, that goes up here.
[44:23.37]Pretty good map.
[44:25.53]High Pass?
[44:26.19]I don't remember.
[44:26.91]Really, I don't.
[44:27.69]But I probably should.
[44:28.52]Gully Wash?
[44:29.12]I don't remember.
[44:30.70]I do, though.
[44:31.34]It's been a long time.
[44:39.55]Mountain Lab.
[44:40.43]I really did not like Mountain Lab.
[44:41.83]I thought it was too... Moss Rock?
[44:45.58]Don't know.
[44:46.08]Gravel Pit.
[44:48.50]One of the only maps with more than two points that's going to be up past a B.
[44:55.46]Ghost Town, don't know.
[44:56.44]Stand-In, don't know.
[44:57.76]Decoy, I don't know.
[44:58.66]Metalworks, I have no idea.
[44:59.74]Coal Town, don't know.
[45:01.16]Snowy Coast, probably played it maybe once.
[45:03.54]Man Works, don't remember.
[45:04.46]Enclosure, don't remember.
[45:05.34]Yukon, don't remember.
[45:06.92]Yeah, I do, but it wasn't very good.
[45:09.01]Freight, no.
[45:12.27]Sunshine, don't know.
[45:13.35]Landfall, don't know.
[45:14.31]Big Rock, don't know.
[45:15.13]Brickyard, don't know.
[45:16.01]Okay.
[45:18.83]Let's get this right.
[45:20.43]Best map in the whole game.
[45:22.09]The best Team Fortress 2 map.
[45:31.05]Disgorge.
[45:34.25]Then Thunder Mountain.
[45:36.39]Then Gold Rush.
[45:43.64]Then Dust Bowl.
[45:45.98]Then Upward.
[45:52.60]Then Hoodoo.
[45:54.80]Then Nucleus.
[45:56.74]Then Harvard.
[45:58.94]Then Frontier.
[46:01.98]No.
[46:02.40]Front.
[46:02.72]No.
[46:06.94]Then Bat.
[46:07.36]No.
[46:08.44]Then... Badwater.
[46:13.09]Then Borneo.
[46:14.41]Then Barn Blitz.
[46:15.11]Then Gravel Pit.
[46:15.85]Then... High... Tower.
[46:22.27]No, then Lakeside.
[46:23.11]No.
[46:23.55]Lakeside sucks, actually.
[46:24.63]Get it down here.
[46:27.75]Then Viaduct.
[46:29.53]Then Hightower.
[46:30.15]Then Turbine.
[46:30.71]Then Two Fort.
[46:31.31]Then Nightfall.
[46:32.74]Cold Front is better than Two Fort.
[46:40.64]Lakeside's better than Pipeline and Nightfall.
[46:45.08]Swiftwater is better than all these, I remember.
[46:48.35]process is probably better than this five gorge is still gorge so it belongs at least in head granary uh the rest of these can stay in the same spot what is the worst map that I've played in Team Fortress 2 it is probably it's still steel junction are the two worst double cross is also awful because it's that big road with the one way to get in you have to go down yeah double cross is terrible um degree keep
[47:18.76]Mountain Lab should be down here too.
[47:22.78]Better than Degroot.
[47:24.11]No, it's not.
[47:27.19]Hydro.
[47:27.85]Doomsday sucks.
[47:31.42]Doomsday really sucks.
[47:46.00]And it's not even the map's fault.
[47:47.49]It's the terrible game mode that it's on.
[47:55.89]Last... Doomsday's worse than Steel.
[48:00.50]I don't know, though.
[48:01.34]I don't think it's the worst thing in the whole game.
[48:07.54]I'm trying to think if I... Yeah.
[48:11.28]If I see it pop up in the server changing map loading screen, how fast am I leaving?
[48:19.13]It's pretty close, probably.
[48:20.25]I don't want to play Doomsday.
[48:24.35]Dig Rude Keep as well.
[48:25.69]I just don't want to play it.
[48:26.97]It was fun for like a week or two, and it was melee only.
[48:30.24]Storm the Castle was fun, but not... After like a month, you just don't want to play it anymore.
[48:34.46]Ugh.
[48:34.74]Ugh.
[48:42.66]I think this is good.
[48:43.76]Yukon is okay.
[48:45.50]Yukon actually is kind of good.
[48:50.86]Yeah, Yukon's actually alright.
[48:54.67]Yukon actually, I'm remembering now, actually, Yukon should probably be up here.
[48:59.15]Yukon's better than these two.
[49:04.05]Is Yukon better than Lakeside, though?
[49:16.47]No, that's actually worse than Pipeline.
[49:18.35]Okay, so, that's it.
[49:20.17]I'm good.
[49:21.47]Here's your list.
[49:24.42]Hydra never got a chance.
[49:26.74]I'd still rather play Hydra than Steel.
[49:30.64]I'd rather play Hydra than Egypt.
[49:32.10]No, that's not true.
[49:33.00]I'd rather play Egypt than Hydra.
[49:34.38]I'd rather play Kong King than Hydra.
[49:40.54]Guys, I really want to bring all... And I'm going to do it.
[49:45.43]I'm going to do it.
[49:47.73]Yeah.
[49:53.38]I'm going to bring every 5 CP map down to F. I would rather play Egypt than, well, CP.
[50:08.79]I'd rather play Kong King than 5 Gorge.
[50:11.15]Goodbye.
[50:14.45]Goodbye.
[50:28.83]Sawmill Cough is okay.
[50:29.97]I can stay.
[50:34.83]Lakeside, where are we at?
[50:36.05]Swiftwater.
[50:38.04]Process.
[50:39.46]I just would not play it.
[50:41.68]Sawmill's Capture the Flag is just turtle mania.
[50:45.90]You just get two engineers that sit in the room.
[50:47.98]The fucking tiny little room that you get the actual briefcase from.
[50:50.80]And they just have two engineers there.
[50:52.45]And nope, you can't win.
[50:53.31]You can't play the game.
[50:54.51]I hate it.
[50:54.73]Ahhhh.
[50:58.61]Now I gotta fix this.
[51:05.00]I'd rather play Sawmill, King of the Hill than these two.
[51:07.14]I'd rather play Yukon than those two.
[51:09.76]I'd rather play... I don't have any E's left.
[51:12.46]Yes, I will.
[51:16.04]Kong King.
[51:18.09]Hydro.
[51:19.05]All the way to the bottom.
[51:21.99]I would definitely not rather play Mountain Lap.
[51:28.53]sawmill capture the flag I'd rather do besides the like competitive five cp maps let's get these all the way at the bottom where they belong though five gorges gorge so it gets to be up the highest there you go wait
[52:00.72]I'd rather play Snake Water and Swift Water than Pipeline and Nightfall.
[52:06.14]They belong down here.
[52:06.82]They're trash.
[52:09.08]They're not good.
[52:19.43]Done.
[52:19.87]No.
[52:22.53]Actually, I hate Egypt, but I don't mind it.
[52:28.82]Alright, it's official.
[52:33.59]It's official.
[52:36.15]There you are.
[52:38.56]I'll go slow so you can see.
[52:52.22]I'm molding right now from this list.
[52:55.09]Well, look.
[52:57.25]Everybody knows.
[52:58.59]Just everybody.
[53:00.55]Whoops, don't break anything.
[53:03.33]Sorry, I was doing like the, like, I'm a magician, like magic act with my hands.
[53:07.19]Everybody, these, from S to B, everybody loves these.
[53:13.77]Maybe you don't have them in the same spot, but this is like, these are the top maps of the game.
[53:22.20]I think that's a pretty fair S through B.
[53:25.58]I just don't like 5 CP.
[53:27.14]And that's my preference, you know?
[53:29.80]I'm a King of the Hill and an Attack, Defense, and Payload.
[53:34.37]Mostly King of the Hill and Payload.
[53:39.59]2 forts too high.
[53:41.07]That's just because I have a love-hate relationship with it.
[53:43.47]Same with Dust Bowl.
[53:49.05]What's next?
[53:51.99]This is fun.
[53:53.05]This is chill, man.
[53:54.23]This is cool.
[53:56.68]I haven't met anyone ever that likes Turbine.
[53:58.26]Do you remember Tier List?
[54:11.59]Tier List?
[54:15.91]No, I remember that from last time.
[54:17.32]I'm not doing it.
[54:19.26]Fullmetal Alchemist characters.
[54:25.81]I don't think... Oh, Bloodborne trick weapons.
[54:28.33]Hell yeah.
[54:28.79]Let's do this one.
[54:31.95]Spoilers for Bloodborne if you've never seen it.
[54:35.91]Does this have the DLC in it too?
[54:41.13]Okay.
[54:43.13]Let's go.
[54:43.47]Alright.
[54:49.65]Now, this is not what I think the best weapon in the game is.
[54:52.15]This is what I think I like to play with the most.
[54:59.35]Fuck the cane.
[55:01.09]I hate the cane.
[55:05.33]Oh, it's going to be tricky.
[55:06.43]Where's the moonlit sword?
[55:14.96]Is that the moonlit sword?
[55:20.86]I desperately tried to get this, but I didn't.
[55:24.72]I gave up.
[55:27.26]making a magic character in Bloodborne was just I hate it I I'm having just all arcane you get like two or three different options I wish I could use it I haven't I can't use it
[55:53.72]This thing was good, but I wouldn't want to use it the whole time.
[55:56.24]The whirligig saw was, I mean, just cool, but I wouldn't want to use it.
[56:02.86]I never got a chance to use the bow.
[56:05.40]So, no, no, no, I have to make a new category.
[56:09.41]Alright, D is the category I have never used it.
[56:15.61]Where's the, my favorite weapon?
[56:19.37]it is I love this thing the big like chain swing weapon oh this is the size right with the boat am I stupid this is it right here that's the boat right yeah I never played with the side
[56:48.35]I did use the wheel for a little bit, but it was bad.
[56:51.61]It was fun for a little bit.
[56:54.27]I didn't... What is this?
[56:58.20]The best weapon in the game.
[57:00.44]This one right here, right?
[57:03.70]All these were good.
[57:13.18]Bad.
[57:15.05]The Saw Spear.
[57:17.39]Is that incorrect?
[57:20.17]Oh, that's the wrong one, yeah.
[57:24.69]These are all great.
[57:29.02]These are boring choices.
[57:30.10]I know, but this is not a boring choice.
[57:33.12]This is like one of the cool DLC weapons.
[57:35.98]Pizza cutter's better than the sauce beer.
[57:38.08]Yeah, also, I like this too.
[57:40.68]This was a lot of fun to use.
[57:42.00]Because you could actually play for the first, like, two-thirds of the game with Arcane.
[57:46.06]Uh, this one was cool, but not that useful.
[57:50.96]This is the, um, that weird arm weapon.
[57:58.35]Yeah, we'll put the boring ones down here.
[57:59.85]I mean, these are just, like, those are the best weapons, but they're boring.
[58:09.27]I did never use the blood, uh, tinge weapons.
[58:12.17]Although I did, I actually used this one for a little while.
[58:14.33]This is a strength one.
[58:15.05]It was alright.
[58:21.30]The boom hammer sucks.
[58:22.18]It's, like, it's probably worse than the cane.
[58:26.67]It's fun to use.
[58:33.04]This one, I'm going to put it down here because every single person that ever plays Bloodborne uses this weapon for the whole game.
[58:39.23]I was one of them on my first playthrough.
[58:41.49]It's either this one or this one.
[58:42.43]I'm going to put them down here.
[58:46.17]Just imagine I didn't play with these.
[58:51.45]They are fantastic weapons.
[58:53.99]But everybody plays with them.
[58:57.61]They actually belong up here with the boring ones.
[59:01.18]Because they're just good.
[59:04.45]Now, the gun blade stuff is something that I have no experience with because I never really did it.
[59:11.06]This is the weird hand-arm thing.
[59:13.42]I hated this thing.
[59:15.08]You have to do that one specific holding R2 where the little arm comes out and stabs him in the head.
[59:18.86]It's hard to use.
[59:23.98]I know this is probably the best weapon, at least from the DLC in the game, but...
[59:32.17]I would probably rather use all these instead of the default ones.
[59:36.97]And this too.
[59:37.59]This is just fun.
[59:42.35]That arm is god tier.
[59:43.49]Yeah, but it's just... I didn't like using it.
[59:45.44]It was like the boom hammer.
[59:46.40]It was that one gimmick with the little thing that comes out.
[59:52.00]Like this has a gimmick, but I can still use it as like a sword.
[60:00.26]I know this is a club, too.
[60:01.46]This makes me want to play the game again for like the fucking sixth time.
[60:06.30]How do I fast forward to the next list?
[60:09.10]It'll be done very soon, don't worry.
[60:12.86]Um, I don't remember these.
[60:14.79]The gunspear, I don't know.
[60:16.33]I didn't really use them.
[60:19.67]No.
[60:20.61]If I ever played through Bloodborne again, I would use one of these weapons.
[60:25.39]These things were awesome, and I remember getting so angry trying to get these.
[60:29.79]The maddest I've ever been probably in a video game.
[60:32.34]Spoiler alert for the DLC.
[60:34.62]When you go... Like, just mute the stream.
[60:36.54]Fucking hurry up.
[60:41.24]Getting this weapon was one of the most rage-inducing moments ever.
[60:47.89]This is the dual blades thing that you get.
[60:51.00]But there's two of those weird, huge, sliding shark face monster people down there.
[60:57.85]Wrong weapon?
[60:58.83]Wait, is it?
[61:02.01]No, it's not.
[61:05.79]No, it's not.
[61:06.93]This is the dual weapons, right?
[61:11.30]No, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[61:13.06]The one that's down there.
[61:13.82]Which one is it?
[61:16.33]That's the crow.
[61:16.99]Yeah, right, right, right.
[61:18.11]Stay muted.
[61:18.59]We're talking about spoilers here.
[61:20.47]Yes, that's a crow.
[61:21.53]That's this one.
[61:22.71]It's the... Which one is it?
[61:24.42]It's this one here, right?
[61:30.94]Yeah, okay.
[61:32.52]I wanted to use it.
[61:35.46]Because it was so interesting.
[61:36.34]It was so cool.
[61:38.80]But trying to fight those two things at the same time was so painful.
[61:42.78]Alright, now you can un-view.
[61:43.76]But holy shit, I remember being so angry at that game.
[61:47.56]Fighting two of those things.
[61:50.88]Shaman bone.
[61:51.62]I know, but holy fuck.
[61:53.48]If you don't know that, you are in deep shit.
[61:58.99]I love Bloodborne, but haven't used like half the weapons.
[62:01.35]Isn't that part of the fun?
[62:04.63]Isn't part of the fun?
[62:05.59]Okay, playthrough one.
[62:08.61]Let's see.
[62:09.53]I'll go through every playthrough.
[62:10.81]You ready?
[62:14.03]First playthrough of Bloodborne.
[62:15.89]So, take your screenshot, this is what I have to say.
[62:17.69]Okay, now, this is the first playthrough up here.
[62:21.92]This is my first playthrough.
[62:22.90]I used these two.
[62:23.76]Second playthrough.
[62:24.62]Holy shit, this game's fucking, like, best game I've ever played in my whole life.
[62:27.64]Second playthrough.
[62:30.80]These two.
[62:32.39]Oh, wow, this is amazing.
[62:33.31]So much fun.
[62:34.39]Third playthrough.
[62:36.33]I was... I think I was just, like, a normal asshole.
[62:41.61]Third playthrough I remember specifically.
[62:43.99]Desperately wanting to get this.
[62:49.76]And I think I probably used... I think I actually used the hammer.
[62:54.36]And then I gave up.
[62:55.92]At like the... Spoiler alert.
[62:58.58]If you give up at this point here, you've already played through the whole damn game.
[63:03.32]I just spoiled it.
[63:04.14]Whatever.
[63:05.64]Yes.
[63:06.06]Yes.
[63:06.36]Because I got to the point where I was trying to fight Orphan with a fucking boom hammer.
[63:12.05]And I was like, this is not possible to do.
[63:14.79]I'm done.
[63:21.79]Quick, re-mute.
[63:24.27]Okay, so that's playthrough number one, two, three, four.
[63:29.05]Playthrough number five, I did a comedy playthrough, so these are the two I did.
[63:36.23]Done.
[63:37.87]I've played through the game like five times.
[63:44.34]I mean, I've used these.
[63:46.86]Which have I not actually physically touched?
[63:53.96]Everything down here is what I have not even physically used.
[64:00.25]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[64:01.35]This was during the comedy run.
[64:03.73]This is what I ended up with during the strength comedy run.
[64:07.61]Okay.
[64:11.26]Yeah.
[64:15.93]I have not equipped any of the weapons below because I didn't have time, wasn't doing the build, or didn't want to use it.
[64:28.11]Show us your saves to prove this.
[64:30.44]I have not had this PlayStation 4 in probably three and a half years.
[64:36.56]What about the steak driver?
[64:41.91]Where is it?
[64:42.63]It's the... Oh, right.
[64:44.78]Yeah.
[64:45.04]Okay.
[64:45.34]Yeah.
[64:45.52]Sorry.
[64:45.74]Sorry.
[64:46.08]I've used it, but it would make it for like 30 minutes.
[64:57.79]Can I unmute?
[64:58.27]You can... Yes.
[64:59.11]Unmute.
[65:03.24]You play the game five times and never touch half the weapons?
[65:06.40]I mean, I physically maybe had them in my inventory, but I never used them because you have to level up stuff.
[65:13.41]You have to upgrade your weapons, and I just was like, I don't feel like using that.
[65:16.89]That's kind of cool.
[65:17.59]You know, you get a weapon in these games, and you take like two or three swings, and you go, nah, and then you just put it away.
[65:30.87]three specs make it harder yeah yeah you have to you can't just be doing a strength build and then all of a sudden be like you know what I want to use the bow there you go I mean this is this is not my tier list we already went over that now give me another one it's the type of game where you can just beat it with the whole game with one weapon yeah
[65:56.09]Bloodborne bosses, but this is spoilers though.
[65:58.65]That was really fast.
[65:59.69]A lot of people like did like a boss ranking thing That was quick But if you haven't played Bloodborne or you don't do you really all Souls Bloodborne all Souls bosses?
[66:16.75]I don't even remember half of these That every Souls boss
[66:31.72]Um... Wrong one.
[66:39.24]Can we, uh... Possible emotes?
[66:46.03]Nah, we're gonna do that later.
[66:46.83]We're gonna do that a different day.
[66:50.01]We're gonna do, like, another emote contest, like, soon here.

[71:58.23]I'm going to spoil the entire show.
[72:00.62]If you've never seen Fullmetal Alchemist, at this point, you don't know the whole show.
[72:09.60]Where is he?
[72:10.68]There he is.
[72:13.60]I mean, enough with the joke.
[72:21.33]Why are they even on here?
[72:22.31]Like, why are they even on here?
[72:27.79]Can there be, like, a dog category?
[72:29.13]Like, that's... They're just dogs.
[72:32.44]I knew that people were gonna do this.
[72:33.46]I knew it.
[72:33.72]They're better than Kimber.
[72:42.11]D for dog, right?
[72:46.79]Mustang is cool, but he's kind of annoying.
[72:51.86]Where's, uh... Where's Hughes?
[72:54.04]There you are.
[72:57.79]And I know they kind of look the same, but I like them both.

[73:11.75]Whoa.
[73:12.65]Those of you that remember, this is spoilers for the whole show.
[73:14.73]So if you're still here, then that means you've probably seen or you don't care.
[73:18.63]Greed, but... Excuse me.
[73:27.71]But isn't... But this is different.
[73:31.25]This is different.
[73:34.64]I know that I just said I'm spoiling the whole show, but I can't do it.
[73:41.74]I'm having trouble giving the full spoilers because I'm scared that somebody's tabbed and they're muted and they're going to hit the button and they're going to go... They're going to get the whole thing.
[73:53.54]Who cares?
[73:54.36]Okay.
[73:55.28]Here we go.
[73:55.94]This is a Fullmetal Alchemist stream from here on out.
[74:00.40]Which greed?
[74:01.02]Because, I mean, this greed was, like, funnier, but this greed was cooler.
[74:17.98]That's tricky.
[74:31.20]That's Ling.
[74:32.34]Uncultured fucking stupid dumb fucking idiot stream.
[74:36.45]Wait, what version is this?

[75:05.96]Okay, yeah.
[75:06.84]You're cool.
[75:10.48]Are you cooler than Barry the Chopper, though?
[75:19.15]No.
[75:22.67]You're definitely cooler.
[75:23.49]Sloth is... Why are you even up here?
[75:30.47]Just a little bit cooler.

[76:27.42]Put Al in A. I wasn't a fan.
[76:36.64]I'm missing the third dog.
[76:44.03]There's no third dog.
[76:46.96]Alright, I know.
[76:47.70]Spoilers, spoilers, spoilers!
[76:49.22]But I... What do I care?
[76:51.01]Envy.
[77:14.06]Fuck.
[77:17.34]No, you- Envy was cool for the first, like, 12 episodes.
[77:21.12]Then it just got, like, stupid.
[77:27.05]There's one specific reason why.
[77:28.81]Because it was just, like, okay.
[77:32.45]Okay, so you're- Spoiler alert.
[77:35.56]Spoiler alert!
[77:37.64]You- You- So- Because fucking- I can't do- I need to put, like, a thing on screen.
[77:44.74]I'm so- I know, I'm sorry.
[77:48.29]We've all, you haven't seen it.
[77:49.65]I know, but people just, somebody just came in and said, hey, what are you doing?
[77:55.24]Okay.
[77:57.76]Spoilers for the whole show.
[77:58.88]So, the first, like, 12 episodes, okay, cool, but, like, the rest of you are fucking, like, dumb caterpillar.
[78:03.17]Like, what a stupid, I hated it.
[78:05.45]D. I just said it.
[78:07.63]I did it.
[78:29.51]Ah, she was kind of annoying.
[78:33.95]Eh.
[78:35.39]She's cool, but, like... What do you mean, what?
[78:43.90]Is this the right person?
[78:45.04]Whom I think... What do you mean, take that back?
[78:47.02]Whoa, holy shit, I just, like, I just, like, fucking put oxygen into a fire.
[79:00.24]This is Hawkeye.
[79:01.34]Oh, right.
[79:04.06]Gun.
[79:04.50]With a gun.
[79:05.44]Okay.
[79:05.98]It's been like seven years since I've seen this show.
[79:08.00]I don't even... I don't know who... I don't know who these people are.
[79:25.19]Eh, this...
[79:46.79]Where's, um...
[80:17.13]I was just moved.
[80:20.58]I don't know who this is.
[80:22.50]I don't... I don't... Who's, like, the big bearded guy?
[80:35.94]Is this... Wait, is this... Who's this?
[80:37.32]Alright, D is like, I don't remember who you are.
[80:46.14]This is part of the group of these four guys, right?
[80:51.84]This is the same person.
[80:54.31]This is the same person.
[81:05.44]I don't...
[81:13.53]I don't remember.
[81:14.31]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[81:15.41]Hold on.
[81:15.72]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[81:23.22]Who are these people?
[81:26.22]This is the lion.
[81:33.07]Where's the frog?
[81:34.05]Where's the frog?
[81:37.17]Where's the frog?
[81:48.15]Yeah, the... There's no frog or scar.
[81:57.34]Yeah, there's this scar.
[82:02.08]That's not scar.
[82:03.07]The scar was already up here.
[82:03.99]Right here.
[82:11.01]That's not scar?
[82:15.22]That's Scar's brother.
[82:16.28]Well, uh, fucking, what do you, there's no Scar here.
[82:27.08]Wait, was this the, oh, no, no, no, wait a minute.
[82:29.71]This, these two.
[82:31.13]I remember these two.
[82:32.27]In fact, you guys are way cooler than the main characters.
[82:34.43]They should've just made this show about YouTube.
[82:36.63]Because you're way more interesting.
[82:38.89]Uh, uh.
[82:48.47]um this is library book book did like I've got a lot of books in my hands and I fell down right okay let me break this down
[83:12.08]I can't believe the fucking frog's not here.
[83:17.32]That's unbelievable
[83:52.03]Where's Scar?
[83:52.73]I don't know.
[83:55.29]I'm working on this.
[84:12.84]You are like a horse.
[84:24.05]Now, I wasn't a fan of, like, the bounce-off dialogue from the main characters quadruple here.
[84:33.05]These guys were only in the room to, like, have somebody to respond to the main character when they talked.
[84:39.16]It was to, like, have dialogue A, dialogue B. Dialogue A, dialogue B. I mean, they weren't bad characters or anything.
[84:50.03]It's just, but that... You're better than Pride.
[85:04.78]I'm working on it.
[85:05.52]I'm working on it.
[85:18.20]I don't know who half of these people are down here.
[85:20.37]This is like the same person.
[85:22.03]Is this supposed to be Scar?
[85:25.61]You're like probably up here then.
[85:31.73]No.
[85:33.15]Well, whatever.
[85:33.59]Scar's not on this list.
[85:37.80]Okay, from... Okay, from Envy over... No, from... Okay, from Priest Guy over, I don't really remember who any of these people really were.
[85:54.37]Where would I put Scar?
[85:56.59]Probably a little bit past Hohenheim.
[86:02.20]Or maybe right before Hohenheim.
[86:07.06]I'm actually doing this list.
[86:15.79]Is this a dream?
[86:22.51]Yeah, this trio didn't... whatever.
[86:25.65]But, to be fair... You're cooler than the fucking little panda.
[86:43.76]Okay.
[86:44.42]Done.
[86:44.90]I just did it.
[86:45.33]Where's Scar?
[86:46.59]He's like over here.
[86:47.95]You know what?
[86:54.61]That's better.
[86:56.68]Is it though?
[87:03.66]Yep.
[87:43.89]Alright, okay.
[87:44.39]Okay.
[88:04.10]This is a dog shit list?
[88:07.56]The fuck do you know about Full Metal?
[88:09.80]I've seen both TV series.
[88:12.62]I've read all the manga.
[88:25.31]You're really doing Scar's brother like this.
[88:27.27]No, this is just like, I don't...
[88:36.97]Okay, and then I remember who that is.
[88:39.21]Yeah, that you are definitely cooler than Dr. Marco.
[88:41.75]Dr. Marco is like the worst of all the characters that have been in more than 10 episodes.
[88:47.40]Alright, I'm done.
[89:01.48]Give me another one.
[89:05.25]What time is it?
[89:05.95]Holy shit, I've been doing this for a long time.
[89:08.83]Animals at the zoo.
[89:11.48]That's actually pretty fucking sick.
[89:13.16]I'm gonna do animals at the zoo.
[89:33.07]This is going to be tricky.
[89:34.21]This is actually going to be very hard to do.
[89:35.64]Um...
[90:02.89]right you're gonna but why why are why are tigers and cats so low because it's that and like like wolves are low too just because that's not that big it's like not that big of a deal to see like a lot like a tiger at a zoo like a lion at the zoo that's if you saw an armadillo or like a monitor lizard at the zoo that's pretty cool I mean it's cool but I I don't know that I don't hate that I think it's it's interesting a pig at the zoo
[90:31.16]But pigs are like one of my favorite animals.
[90:36.34]These are awesome.
[90:37.14]Yes, I know.
[90:37.74]But if I'm going to the zoo, I'm going right to the pig den.
[90:55.65]It's hard to put any of these in the hate category.
[90:59.52]I don't hate any of these animals.
[91:06.22]No, I don't.
[91:08.08]I don't hate otter.
[91:12.58]No, I don't hate any of these.
[91:19.56]How could you hate something like this?
[91:30.56]This is just the kind of pictures I take when I go on vacation.
[91:38.52]uh iguana is s tier I don't I disagree monitor lizard is s tier let me correct that quickly for you koalas hippopotamus I don't I can't put anything down and hate
[92:13.18]Alright, let's just get this over with.
[92:14.39]Okay, all the cats are in one spot.
[92:40.41]That would be cool.
[92:40.93]That would be really cool, actually.
[92:57.11]I don't hate it.
[92:58.07]I don't hate geese, or whatever, a swan.
[93:05.02]That's not that interesting to me.
[93:08.00]It's a swan.
[93:09.78]You can see swans everywhere.
[93:11.26]We're talking about at the zoo.
[93:16.40]If you go to the zoo, I want to see something besides a fucking goose.
[93:25.84]It's a pelican.
[93:30.77]It's staying.
[93:33.31]Now that's fucking cool.
[93:40.23]Llama.
[93:40.97]That's... Alright.
[93:41.99]No, I'm sticking with it.
[93:43.05]I'll tell you why.
[93:43.67]Because a llama... You can go to a petting... It's not that... And they spit on you.
[93:52.28]Yes.
[93:57.01]I'm only going by going to the zoo.
[94:07.19]A petting zoo is a zoo.
[94:08.49]I don't want to get spit on.
[94:09.87]I don't want to get spit on.
[94:11.33]I don't... I'm changing this to a different... There.
[94:31.85]Like.
[94:32.21]Okay, then this is going to be...
[94:45.85]Like, I would just, I would walk by and go, look at the lion.
[94:49.40]Alright, let's keep going.
[95:05.18]It's a moose.
[95:07.44]I mean, I would enjoy it.
[95:11.48]Elephants, that's pretty fucking cool.
[95:13.87]Platypus, get the fuck up there.
[95:17.02]Not all the way.
[95:18.46]That's for the monitor lizard.
[95:20.42]Hippopotamus, that's pretty cool.
[95:24.14]I mean, the seals, I would probably just... I mean, they're cool, but I would just look for a few... I would just sit there and be like, alright, let's go.
[95:29.04]Zebras, same thing.
[95:32.56]Zebras' ass, same thing.
[95:40.19]I feel like you can only look at...
[95:45.56]I've never seen... I've never gone to one.
[95:47.40]I've never seen an orca.
[95:53.26]Like, I don't know what my reaction would be.
[95:55.64]Because I've never seen one.
[95:57.85]Indifferent.
[95:59.75]Indifferent.
[96:02.15]No, this is just the dinosaur in Jurassic Park that runs around really small and the T-Rex eats them.
[96:09.15]I don't... I'm not gonna... I don't care.
[96:11.53]It's like... I guess it's okay.
[96:12.53]Okay.
[96:19.22]It's a filler animal, yeah.
[96:23.47]But... A panda would be kinda cool.
[96:28.79]I'll fix this.
[96:29.63]Gorilla, yeah.
[96:32.47]All the apes just do cool shit.
[96:34.09]They do funny, interesting shit.
[96:36.35]They're just interesting.
[96:39.67]This thing is just gonna float around.
[96:44.29]They just go forward.
[96:46.80]And I love birds.
[96:48.32]I got a peacock up here.
[96:50.80]But you'll sit and watch the orangutan, like, eat an orange for five minutes straight just because you're going to do that.
[97:02.32]I've never even... I've never seen... Polar bears are cool, but I don't think I've ever seen one.
[97:06.42]What is this, a dolphin?
[97:07.28]Isn't this cool?
[97:10.44]Koala?
[97:13.10]I mean, that's really cool, but I...
[97:22.45]I love turtles, and this is something coming from somebody that is a reptile fan.
[97:27.99]But, they're pretty boring.
[97:31.75]At the zoo.
[97:32.69]At the zoo.
[97:33.31]At the zoo.
[97:33.83]Remember, at the zoo, the turtles are always going to sit and look at you.
[97:43.09]Don't tell me that I don't like reptiles.
[97:44.67]I've got a monitor, and that is number one.
[97:51.81]I'll do it for 15 seconds.
[97:59.17]Foxes are cool.
[98:00.79]I'll fix it.
[98:05.87]Wait, isn't this a seal?
[98:07.63]What's this then?
[98:11.14]Wait, isn't there another seal?
[98:12.12]Okay, that's an otter seal.
[98:13.40]Where's the other one?
[98:15.02]What's that?
[98:15.36]Oh, it's a sea lion.
[98:21.23]No, I would look for 15 seconds.
[98:23.98]No, that's kind of higher up too.
[98:26.20]I'm going to fix it.
[98:28.78]Bears.
[98:30.34]I mean, bears are cool.
[98:31.58]I love bears.
[98:33.81]What is this, a vulture?
[98:36.29]I'd probably look for 15 seconds.
[98:37.91]Hyena.
[98:38.59]They're pretty cool.
[98:39.69]Lemur.
[98:40.21]Pretty cool.
[98:41.71]Other, like, super pig.
[98:43.68]Yep.
[98:47.57]This is, like, this is Piggy and then, like, Piggy-oto.
[98:54.08]And then... Omega Pig!
[99:02.00]These are alright.
[99:07.74]Alright, now... Let me get this right.
[99:17.67]That's the real timeline right there.
[99:18.93]That's the real Omega Pig.
[99:22.83]Okay.
[99:25.13]So.
[99:26.73]How do I, what do I change here?
[99:35.62]Titan Pig.
[99:43.67]Yeah.
[99:45.11]Yeah, that's correct.
[99:46.59]That's just stick.
[99:54.63]Alright, let's get this one right.
[99:57.18]Monitor lizard.
[99:59.00]Yeah.
[100:00.82]I'm gonna have one of these before I... Before I die, I will make a promise to me.
[100:06.32]Before the day I die, I'm going to own a, like, two to three foot long fucking monitor lizard.
[100:15.29]Maybe not a monitor, but, like, at least a one to two foot long lizard.
[100:20.93]Like a tegu or a... Maybe even a monitor...
[100:28.20]Before the day I die.
[100:32.07]They're so interesting.
[100:35.59]Tegu's the way to go.
[100:36.51]Monitors suck.
[100:38.91]I've done my research.
[100:40.35]Tegu's are huge.
[100:41.05]Yeah, I know, I know.
[100:44.83]Okay.
[100:47.66]Ostrich.
[100:48.54]Platypus.
[100:49.24]What a cool animal.
[100:53.38]God just said, fuck it, and threw a bunch of shit in a blender and then dumped it on the ground.
[100:57.36]What an interesting animal.
[101:02.42]God was late for class and had to do his homework real quick.
[101:09.25]Yeah.
[101:09.91]One of the coolest animals on Earth.
[101:18.49]These huge birds are just so interesting, too.
[101:21.75]What are you doing up here?
[101:22.49]Get out of here.
[101:24.45]Oh wait, that's an otter.
[101:32.31]Yeah, I think otters are cooler than the Omega Pig, Titan Pig evolution.
[101:39.26]But I still love them.
[101:50.94]Peacock is going to come down a little.
[101:52.90]Rangtangs are awesome.
[101:55.02]Gorillas are really, really cool.
[101:56.22]Iguanas.
[102:01.76]Alligators are fucking cool too, though.
[102:06.29]I would rather go look at a giraffe and an elephant than an alligator, though.
[102:09.01]Because they kind of just stand around.
[102:11.07]They just sit there.
[102:25.03]I don't think that's fair.
[102:27.34]I would just look at the snake for 15 seconds.
[102:33.66]The snakes don't do anything.
[102:41.30]Alligators don't do anything, but they're huge.
[102:43.66]Monitors are actually really interesting.
[102:46.02]They run around.
[102:46.90]They have big tongues that come out.
[102:52.42]They look at you.
[102:53.28]They're very, very excited.
[102:58.99]What a way cooler version of a lion.
[103:02.65]This is a lion with scales and a big tongue that comes out.
[103:18.81]They have chainmail skeletons.
[103:20.79]That's wow.
[103:22.73]That's pretty dope.
[103:26.15]Okay.
[103:33.32]But I don't really... Snakes don't... I love reptiles and amphibians, but snakes don't do it for me.
[103:38.12]They... They're really, really cool.
[103:41.11]They're really interesting.
[103:41.89]They have a lot of really... They have great designs on their skin and stuff.
[103:50.85]There's so many different types.
[103:54.09]They have some fun personalities.
[104:00.79]They're not really...
[104:02.76]Plus, they're the devil.
[104:12.99]That should be down here.
[104:15.35]Guys, I'm sorry.
[104:16.21]If you can walk into a PetSmart and see this, that's not something that's that cool to look at at the zoo.
[104:28.20]They're different.
[104:29.06]I don't hate any... None of these animals... I love all of these animals.
[104:34.77]All of them.
[104:37.81]It's just... Who do I prefer?
[104:46.18]Then put them under love.
[104:48.16]But that's not how a tier list works.
[104:57.54]Okay, let's keep this going.
[104:58.88]I want to get this right.
[105:05.70]S is correct.
[105:07.88]A needs a little bit of work.
[105:23.97]That's correct.
[105:32.61]Yeah, that's correct.
[105:33.25]That's even more correct.
[105:46.61]Close.
[105:58.59]Done!
[106:06.02]Done.
[106:07.12]Done.
[106:08.48]Alright, down at the like.
[106:09.74]Ah, these are cool.
[106:10.42]I like these animals.
[106:11.25]They're pretty cool.
[106:25.63]The only reason why people really like these is because they're in a bunch of animated movies.
[106:31.34]And they always just show up for like a minute.
[106:36.39]Koalas are fucking horrible animals.
[106:37.79]They have one of the smallest brains-to-body ratios of any mammal.
[106:41.62]Additionally, their brains are smooth.
[106:42.94]The brain is folded to increase the surface for neurons.
[106:45.70]If you present a koala... If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognize it as food.
[107:00.64]They are too thick to adapt their feeding behavior.
[107:05.31]to cope with change in a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death.
[107:20.38]So?
[107:20.66]What is that?
[107:27.18]They're stupid as fuck.
[107:28.76]They only survive because their food, what was it?
[107:31.95]They only survive because their food makes them poisonous.
[107:38.78]But look at their ears.
[107:41.06]They should be extinct.
[107:42.64]Holy shit, that's rough.
[107:50.61]Flamingos, pretty cool.
[107:52.41]Dolphins.
[107:53.07]I mean, just dolphins should probably be up there.
[107:55.43]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[107:56.43]Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.
[107:59.33]Bump.
[108:13.68]I mean, camels are cool, though.
[108:23.83]Camel cooler than a polar bear.
[108:25.37]Polar bear cooler than a buff fox.
[108:29.54]What's this one?
[108:34.54]This is Pixar fox versus HBO fox.
[108:38.75]Which one?
[108:51.06]You don't know what a red panda is.
[108:56.62]Apparently not.
[108:58.78]And for that reason, I'm out.
[109:18.55]I'll take the Pixar fox over the, uh, fox.
[109:22.05]It's cool.
[109:23.29]Kinda cooler than an iguana.
[109:25.59]Is it though?
[109:26.25]They both belong up here?
[109:28.45]No they don't.
[109:37.71]Koala brain.
[109:39.93]No, I thought- I would- I eat food if it's in front of me.
[109:46.70]Okay, is the rest of this correct?
[109:51.78]Almost.
[109:52.22]Yeah.
[109:53.25]Yeah.
[109:55.69]Yeah, I guess.
[109:56.61]No, I would rather see these.
[109:58.07]No.
[109:59.39]I'd rather, like, see a koala, though.
[110:01.61]I never get to see them.
[110:05.33]Okay.
[110:05.83]Would look for 15 seconds.
[110:10.43]Who would I look for 16 seconds?
[110:20.33]Vultures.
[110:24.24]and then the lions because there you go to the lions and you see the lions that's not a vulture wait it's an anteater it's not like a like wings laid out like like this going down assume like it's wings up see like wing up wing up just swoop down landing grabbing something this is okay wrong that's an anteater alright those things are awesome
[110:52.38]Alright, I would look for 15 seconds at the lion.
[110:54.86]Probably the most.
[110:57.72]And then honestly, probably the turtle.
[111:00.35]My reasoning for that is I would just open up my phone and this would be where I would be texting somebody.
[111:04.07]I could probably sit there for like five straight minutes.
[111:09.01]This is my I'm taking a break section of the zoo.
[111:14.41]I'd be there for 15 seconds.
[111:15.71]This is a bobcat.
[111:21.72]Just slightly larger than Housecat cat.
[111:25.48]Cool.
[111:26.28]And they've got the beards and stuff.
[111:30.83]I love them.
[111:36.09]That's a lynx.
[111:37.41]Wait, what do you mean it's a lynx?
[111:54.53]The lynx is known by the tuft of black hair on the tips of its ears, and it's short of bobbed tail.
[112:00.02]In fact, one species of lynx is called... a bobcat.
[112:15.16]Fucking stupid goddamn fucking stupid fucking idiot fucking goddamn... One species!
[112:22.34]It's still correct!
[112:27.46]And for that, go get a haircut.
[112:36.55]That one isn't the bobcat.
[112:38.71]Lynxes are a bobcat.
[112:40.13]A bobcat is a lynx.
[112:41.93]It's a bobcat.
[112:43.42]It could be a bobcat just because it's a specific lynx.
[112:46.34]It could be a bobcat.
[112:47.10]Bobcat is a lynx.
[112:48.00]Lynx is a bobcat.
[112:48.76]There's a species that is the bobcat.
[112:59.09]Not all lynxes are bobcats.
[113:00.83]But all bobcats are lynxes.
[113:05.25]Thank you.
[113:06.06]Thank you.
[113:06.32]I appreciate it.
[113:06.88]Thank you.
[113:16.76]Can we just agree that the T-Rex food is down here?
[113:30.75]Alright.
[113:32.91]I would look at a whale for 15 seconds.
[113:34.69]I would.
[113:35.15]Probably way more than a lion.
[113:36.21]Alright, let's finish this up.
[113:38.45]Let's go with some manatee.
[113:41.00]Cool.
[113:45.24]You don't have to go to the zoo.
[113:47.00]Just live in Maine and look out your window.
[113:50.94]They're huge and they're majestic, but I don't... Not that big.
[113:54.33]Whatever.
[113:54.55]Whatever.
[113:59.56]I'm not sure.
[113:59.92]Is this just a horse?
[114:02.84]Or is it a zebra?
[114:03.50]What is this animal?
[114:05.91]It has a saddle on it.
[114:12.17]That's an okapi.
[114:15.31]That is a fucking okapi of the zebra.
[114:18.97]I'm so sorry.
[114:20.27]I'm sorry.
[114:21.23]If a hundred people leave, I get it.
[114:34.61]They have blue tongues?
[114:37.93]Are you serious?
[114:49.15]I think I'm good.
[114:51.22]I think this is the list.
[114:51.98]But which one of the cats besides a lion would I want to see the most?
[114:56.86]Probably that.
[114:58.34]Or that.
[114:59.00]No.
[115:03.81]that no no this is a chat just that's just a tiger right this is just that's that's a tiger it's
[115:30.28]I would like to see that.
[115:33.56]Links.
[115:36.02]Fuck.
[115:39.92]Done.

[116:21.47]I already did it.
[116:26.26]Days of the Week.
[116:29.64]Um...
[116:31.47]Obviously, like, Friday and Saturday, the best days of the week.
[116:35.18]Sunday's the worst day in the week.
[116:37.14]Because everything's closed.
[116:39.38]Sundays actually suck.
[116:41.30]Sundays are worse than Mondays.
[116:44.74]At least shit's open on Monday.
[116:50.84]Do bugs.
[116:53.44]Alright, I'm gonna do bugs.
[116:55.30]And then, it's been six and a half hours.
[116:59.78]Have we been doing this for three and a half hours?
[117:02.56]When did I stop playing Katamari?
[117:12.19]Wow.
[117:20.80]I'm not a big fan of Sundays.
[117:23.20]Sundays just remind you.
[117:25.67]It's over.
[117:26.71]The week is over.
[117:28.01]It's time for a new one.
[117:29.35]I don't want a new one.
[117:30.27]I want to stay on the old one.
[117:32.43]Do we have any bugs?
[117:42.00]Is there a bug tier list?
[117:48.31]No, I'm not doing Nicktoons.
[117:49.65]That'll take like three hours.
[117:58.03]Cooked eggs.
[118:01.65]I'll do the cooked eggs one.
[118:04.27]Wait, give me the cooked eggs one again.

[119:17.49]Okay, done.
[119:18.01]This list sucks.
[119:29.93]Bread types.
[119:32.49]You guys must be hungry.
[119:36.01]How hungry are you guys?
[119:37.61]I'm getting like pizza toppings, bread crusts.
[119:41.28]Actually, this is pretty good choice.
[119:45.38]Good choice.
[119:46.80]I mean that.
[120:03.29]Awful.
[120:07.57]Pretty damn great.
[120:08.59]Bagels.
[120:12.39]Sourdough.
[120:12.95]I have to be in the mood for it.
[120:14.09]Pita bread.
[120:14.67]Up here.
[120:17.01]Flat bread.
[120:17.71]Somewhere up here.
[120:18.99]Brioche.
[120:23.75]Oatmeal bread.
[120:24.69]D. Whole wheat bread.
[120:26.79]F. Rye bread.
[120:28.83]Somewhere in A. Croissant.
[120:31.85]S.
[120:33.58]Biscuit.
[120:34.75]A. Potato bread is S2.
[120:36.21]No.
[120:37.29]Potato bread is god tier.
[120:38.45]Absolute god tier.
[120:40.31]It was, uh... Banana bread.
[120:42.45]Fucking absolute god tier.
[120:45.03]Corn bread.
[120:46.05]Close.
[120:47.01]But not better than pita bread.
[120:49.91]Naan.
[120:50.65]Up there.
[120:52.76]Pretzel bread.
[120:53.50]Not even close.
[120:54.36]This is not even a competition.
[120:59.88]English muffin.
[121:03.51]I hate English muffins.
[121:04.71]I don't like cinnamon bread.
[121:05.97]I need sweet bread.
[121:06.89]Don't like it.
[121:08.23]Zucchini bread.
[121:08.89]It's in there with the same, like the oatmeal.
[121:12.61]Pumpernickel is better than white bread.
[121:16.79]And sourdough.
[121:18.43]French bread.
[121:19.39]Get it up here.
[121:19.89]We'll fix it.
[121:20.97]Breadstick.
[121:22.49]Depends from where.
[121:24.23]From where.
[121:30.29]Homemade or from Olive Garden?
[121:31.93]Because...
[121:35.13]From the Olive Garden?
[121:42.26]Okay.
[121:43.02]Little Caesars.
[121:44.00]I don't know about that.
[121:45.90]Homemade?
[121:46.56]Better.
[121:49.42]What is butter bread?
[121:50.54]I don't think I've ever had this before.
[121:52.97]Yeast bread.
[121:53.69]I...
[122:20.02]Butter bread, butter bread, and what did the yeast bread go?
[122:25.90]It's just bread.
[122:26.90]Alright, let's fix this.
[122:34.54]I... potato bread, pretzel bread.
[122:36.70]I don't know how you could eat potato bread or pretzel bread and say that's not the best thing I've ever had in my life that was made from bread.
[122:50.02]Huh?
[122:50.72]I don't know.
[122:51.36]You know what I'm trying to say.
[122:52.74]Ah, banana bread doesn't belong up here.
[122:54.82]That was a knee-jerk reaction.
[123:06.08]It should be.
[123:06.90]It's close.
[123:08.30]It's A++.
[123:08.82]Hawaiian rolls better than rye.
[123:12.79]Peanut bread better than rye.
[123:15.54]Cornbread and rye are above the same.
[123:17.20]Naan and pita bread.
[123:19.67]Fantastic.
[123:21.09]Tortilla.
[123:24.07]Flat.
[123:24.61]I would actually put flat bread up above rye.
[123:27.19]And we're gonna put... We're gonna put rye down here.
[123:30.97]I'd rather have flour tortilla than rye.
[123:33.30]Garlic bread.
[123:35.80]It's good, but it's just so... It's basic.
[123:38.16]It is.
[123:41.28]This is like snack bread.
[123:44.42]It's snack bread.
[123:45.86]Garlic bread, breadsticks.
[123:47.94]It's good.
[123:48.58]It's very good.
[123:49.54]It's exceptional.
[123:51.64]But... I mean, it's good.
[123:56.37]But it's snack bread.
[123:58.31]Snacks are good.
[123:58.91]Yes, they are.
[123:59.47]But would I rather have garlic bread or would I rather have a nice French bread with oil?
[124:06.35]That's the top tier snack bread.
[124:09.32]I would rather have... No, I would rather have bagel than garlic bread.
[124:13.15]You have to be in the mood for- you gotta be in the mood for garlic bread.
[124:17.28]It's very heavy.
[124:18.10]Like, really dense and cheesy sometimes and really heavy garlic and oil.
[124:26.97]It's not a light snack.
[124:35.07]Crude oil?
[124:35.99]What the fuck are you talking about?
[124:38.90]What kind of garlic bread are you guys eating that isn't like soaked in oil and cheese?
[124:45.32]That's how you make garlic bread.
[124:46.44]You put a bunch of garlic and oil on it.
[124:56.12]No cheese on garlic bread.
[124:57.26]It's still got oil on it.
[125:00.10]You eat, what do you don't have, you don't put oil on your garlic bread.
[125:02.12]What do you just put a clove of garlic on a piece of bread and eat it?
[125:17.29]Where the fuck is their cheese on garlic bread?
[125:19.23]I feel like I'm on another planet right now.
[125:24.37]Am I on another planet?
[125:28.13]Where the fuck is their cheese and oil on garlic bread?
[125:58.39]Every single restaurant that I've ever been to.
[126:13.24]Parmesan.
[126:15.90]Oil.
[126:17.26]Garlic.
[126:18.24]Oil.
[126:18.90]Cheese.
[126:20.51]I'm not talking about like fucking cheese whiz.
[126:24.05]What, like American slices?
[126:27.34]What is happening?
[126:29.36]Garlic bread.
[126:31.96]Recipe.
[126:36.82]This is from delish.com.
[126:44.10]Four cloves of garlic.
[126:46.35]One stick of butter.
[126:48.87]It's a light snack, though.
[126:51.47]One French bread baguette.
[126:54.62]Kosher salt, two tablespoons of parsley, and a fourth cup of grated Parmesan cheese.
[127:00.18]This is the number one thing, this is the number one recipe that you find.
[127:10.77]I have to be an alien.
[127:18.79]Half a stick of butter.
[127:23.42]How many days a week are you eating this?
[127:30.15]No, you're not going to pull the parmesan cheese bullshit on me.
[127:33.17]It's cheese.
[127:34.27]Parmesan cheese is cheese.
[127:35.95]Just because you dust it and it's on, it's cheese.
[127:40.54]That's fucking cheese.
[127:44.42]It's sawdust.
[127:45.24]It's different.
[127:45.96]They're different.
[127:59.57]Parmesan or Reggiano?
[128:02.09]Sorry, what did I say?
[128:03.33]Parmesan?
[128:05.39]I've never had Parmesan cheese on garlic bread.
[128:08.64]Okay, I feel like I'm talking to like five different cultures here.
[128:13.28]How many Americans we have in the chat?
[128:15.26]Press A. Alright.
[128:26.69]How many people from...
[128:29.86]Norway.
[128:30.57]We got in the chat right now.
[128:31.71]Press N. A lot of Norwegians.
[128:42.77]Can I ask the Norwegians something very, very specific?
[128:49.86]Do you put cheese on your garlic bread?
[128:59.74]Can always count on the Norwegians.
[129:12.19]Anyways.
[129:15.43]No, I can't do that in good conscience.
[129:20.66]Would I rather have a heavy-ass, cheesy-ass, oily, fucking sweaty, dumped with fucking garlic and grease, or would I rather have a bagel?
[129:39.85]Lightly toasted.
[129:42.22]With hints of sesame.
[129:48.15]With little chips.
[129:50.16]Little sesame chips and poppy seeds.
[129:53.94]Fresh.
[129:58.20]Not out of a fucking bag.
[129:59.78]That's right.
[130:01.52]I got you.
[130:02.84]I got you guys.
[130:05.04]How many of you guys ate your garlic bread out of a bag?
[130:07.18]Mm-hmm.
[130:12.05]Mm-hmm.
[130:13.84]The bag that you just, and you take the garlic bread out of the bag, and you put it in the oven.
[130:22.67]I know at least 20-30% of you guys eat the bag of garlic bread, and right now you're going like, you got it in your mouth, and the bag is right there, and you're like, oh, fuck.
[130:33.42]L-U-L, idiot boomer.
[130:35.00]And then you go, oh, fuck, he got me.
[130:44.30]Brioche is better than rye.
[130:51.92]Alright.
[130:52.84]I know I'm like, oh, you put cheese on your bread.
[130:55.88]What are you, dope?
[130:56.88]Where's the oil coming from?
[130:57.88]What are you, stupid?
[131:00.67]You gotta get organic garlic.
[131:02.41]Whatever.
[131:02.81]But can you please agree with me that the potato bread is S tier?
[131:15.13]Oh shit.
[131:40.95]Kim made zucchini bread like last week.
[131:44.39]And she just wrote in the chat, she's like, wait, you don't fucking like the zucchini bread downstairs.
[131:53.14]That's not true.
[131:54.46]I haven't gotten here yet.
[131:58.85]Your zucchini bread is fucking very good.
[132:02.69]But I'm trying to figure out, I'm just going through the list.
[132:07.56]Potato bread is my favorite thing.
[132:09.68]That's like, it's like my favorite thing in the world.
[132:13.20]I don't think zucchini bread is S tier.
[132:16.30]Look at banana bread though.
[132:18.85]He's not, I'm not, no.
[132:21.85]It's better than white bread.
[132:23.95]It was stress burp.
[132:37.94]I'm done.
[132:38.20]This is correct.
[132:44.06]I'm done.
[132:45.92]Pretzel bread, croissant, potato bread.
[132:47.32]What happened to the music?
[132:51.61]Was I listening to chill?
[132:52.59]I listen... I'm in a fucking time machine.
[132:56.37]That was a two hour long playlist.
[133:00.56]Didn't I just click the play button like five minutes ago?
[133:07.49]Why is everything MonkaS?
[133:15.61]I like zucchini bread.
[133:17.05]This is just like my favorite breads.
[133:21.54]Look, zucchini bread is good.
[133:25.90]It's not down here.
[133:26.92]I like zucchini bread.
[133:35.88]Uh-oh, he's going Larry David.
[133:38.17]But... Alright, hold on a second here.
[133:41.59]Kim.
[133:43.05]You're telling me that zucchini bread is better than... Crusties with oil?
[133:49.62]That's like one of my favorite things.
[133:51.14]That's gonna be up there.
[133:52.40]Bagels, like a nice crunchy crispy bagel.
[133:59.97]But we're talking about zucchini bread like from the store.
[134:02.53]I would not buy zucchini bread from the store, but if Kim made it...
[134:07.82]It's actually really good.
[134:08.68]No joke.
[134:09.08]No fucking around.
[134:11.38]Did I just replay the Chill Step mix?
[134:17.33]I think it's time to go.
[134:18.23]Zucchini bread is better than sourdough and Puppernickel.
[134:28.36]I didn't even get down here yet!
[134:30.12]I didn't even get down to this portion!
[134:32.40]I just... They were in a row.
[134:39.71]To be fair though, I've had zucchini and bread twice.
[134:42.43]Once from Kim, once from my mother, and they were great.
[134:45.27]But I don't like- I'm not gonna put a- I'm not gonna put, like, turkey on a zucchini sandwich!
[134:50.07]He's sweating.
[134:50.79]Yo, you don't understand.
[135:04.10]I like it.
[135:05.24]It's actually really good.
[135:07.45]Munga S.
[135:09.79]Alright, well that's the end of the tier list.
[135:13.26]I've been streaming for almost seven hours.
[135:14.74]How did that happen?
[135:17.72]Mom's making zucchini bread from Baskin Robbins.
[135:27.89]Keep digging the hole.
[135:47.43]Vegas tier list?
[135:48.65]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[135:50.09]I'll see you tomorrow.
[135:51.69]We were going to play Bumbo.
[135:54.71]But it turned out that Bumbo got bumped to tomorrow.
[136:07.71]That's not making a joke.
[136:11.04]Look, I'm gonna go eat a fucking, like, I'm gonna eat, like, five servings of zucchini bread downstairs.
[136:17.58]I'm just saying, bumped and, it made sense to me, my brain.
[136:23.89]You were dope.
[136:24.91]Hey.
[136:26.05]Easy with that language around here.
[136:31.35]Alright.
[136:32.51]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[136:39.20]We'll play Bumbo tomorrow.
[136:40.40]I'm not sure how long.
[136:44.04]It looks fun, though.
[136:46.96]Thanks for joining me on tonight's stream.
[136:51.54]We'll see you soon.
[136:52.00]If you're gonna show up tomorrow, then hell yeah.
[136:54.92]Maybe we'll see you there.
[137:00.54]All day Bumbo.
[137:01.69]I don't know.
[137:02.09]It depends.
[137:02.85]I really, really like Binding of Isaac.
[137:04.37]When I really first started playing that game...
[137:08.74]I got into it, so we'll see.
[137:14.29]What time tomorrow?
[137:15.53]Somewhere around 1 to 2 p.m.
[137:17.77]Pacific time.
[137:25.45]Take care.
[137:26.31]See you tomorrow.
[137:27.41]Those of you sticking around.
[137:28.32]Let's do the bits.
[137:33.96]Just take a look.
[137:34.86]Okay.
[137:35.00]Okay.
[137:38.62]Alright.
[137:39.18]Okay.
[137:40.00]Good.
[137:45.72]It's never changed.
[137:48.44]Alright.
[137:48.74]Earlier, for those of you that weren't here earlier, we had a huge sub and bit-a-thon that just went crazy.
[137:59.23]There was a train that was about at least a few hundred subs in a row.
[138:03.93]So, thank you so much, all of you.
[138:06.29]Hopefully I caught y'all
[138:08.85]But in the bit department, we had... Louis.
[138:15.58]Thank you, Louis, for the 500 bits.
[138:17.22]Did you say hello?
[138:18.06]Hello?
[138:22.22]Thank you, None... NoneAR.
[138:27.67]Thanks for the 250.
[138:28.53]I can finally donate to the best streamer on Twitch.
[138:30.73]I'm moving to Vegas in January to attend UNLV.
[138:35.40]Nice.
[138:36.42]Any advice or things I should know?
[138:37.66]Also, do you think you will ever play Danganronpa?
[138:41.30]It's one of my favorite franchises.
[138:46.16]I think people brought that up before.
[138:49.95]I don't really remember what it was, but... I'm going to say probably not.
[138:58.62]But I'm open to anything.
[139:02.70]Never in his life will he play Danganronpa.
[139:04.62]Well, you don't know that.
[139:11.15]It's a murder mystery visual novel.
[139:13.83]Is it good?
[139:21.26]Yes.
[139:22.34]No.
[139:22.54]No.
[139:24.85]Ace Attorney is just better.
[139:26.37]If you won't play... If you won't play Ace Attorney, how dare you play this one?
[139:31.18]Easy.
[139:43.09]But yeah, uh... Welcome to Las Vegas.
[139:46.49]Soon.
[139:47.91]Any advice about Vegas?
[139:49.13]Um...
[139:54.57]Stay away from the tables.
[140:03.95]Don't spend all your money, yeah?
[140:07.33]Thanks, Dad.
[140:08.03]No, um... Alright, here you go.
[140:19.92]If you're going to college, I'm assuming that
[140:22.88]I mean, maybe I shouldn't assume this, but I don't know how old you are.
[140:28.74]But... What are you?
[140:30.72]19?
[140:31.34]18?
[140:31.36]Alright, well don't go in the casinos then.
[140:37.59]20.
[140:38.73]How old are you when you start college?
[140:44.40]18?
[140:44.42]17?
[140:44.76]Alright, don't go in the casinos.
[140:52.18]There's a lot to do and a lot to see that in other casinos.
[140:54.34]Go to all the different wonderful, wonderful wildlife and hiking places.
[141:00.86]There's a lot of them.
[141:02.98]We're surrounded by them.
[141:05.68]You don't have to go to the damn casino.
[141:13.74]Go to all the... Did you just say the boring parts?
[141:18.20]Holy God.
[141:24.54]You promised Joel's movie.
[141:27.48]Actually, I said like 50 times that we were gonna watch Joel's movie during the movie night that I do.
[141:35.22]I said it like 30 or 40 times.
[141:54.23]No, we'll watch it.
[141:56.15]I'm gonna give tons of critiques, too.
[141:58.25]Just you wait.
[142:03.60]I'm sure it is funny.
[142:05.12]Joel's a funny guy.
[142:05.94]It wouldn't surprise me if it was funny.
[142:08.70]Funny people do funny things.
[142:10.90]Thinking face.
[142:16.22]But, uh, welcome to Vegas.
[142:20.32]Just don't get too overwhelmed.
[142:21.54]It's pretty easy to have that happen to you.
[142:23.40]Especially initially.
[142:24.66]There's a lot of stuff to look at.
[142:26.12]A lot of things going on.
[142:26.92]A lot of places to go.
[142:27.68]A lot of food to eat.
[142:28.98]Just take it slow, one step at a time.
[142:31.21]Take it in small baby steps.
[142:34.51]It's a great city.
[142:36.31]I love it.
[142:38.47]Dark Soul, thanks for the $2.50.
[142:39.73]70-hour work week coming up.
[142:42.09]So last biddies for a while.
[142:43.77]Oh, so while I hate playing internet doctor, have you been tested for celiac?
[142:49.07]I have.
[142:50.05]Causes an autoimmune reaction in your stomach and small intestines?
[142:52.91]Yes.
[142:54.25]I have been tested for celiac.
[142:56.23]That's initially what I thought was going on, but that's not what's going on.
[143:01.21]70 hours, though.
[143:01.99]Yeah, that is a long fucking time.
[143:04.55]Hope you get some time off after that.
[143:17.17]70.
[143:28.66]I really do hope you get some time off, though.
[143:30.66]It's never fun to have to spend over, over, over time.
[143:37.77]You can get really overtired.
[143:42.65]But, yeah, in regards to medical stuff...
[143:47.25]I'm still trying to figure it out I have some idea I don't really there's not much to talk about because I have another procedure that's coming up to try to really put the nail in the coffin here so it's not like I'm gonna be like hey guys let's talk about my last visit no visit before that the visit before no it's it's not worth really talking about it isn't but it is not celiac
[144:16.06]kind of at some point over the last seven or eight months wish it was that easy to be honest because it's been sort of just a random uh symptomatic what's wrong with me so it's not enough to cause any concern though it's just like an irritating little thing that's just sticking around not enough to cause a problem but it's enough to be annoying
[144:44.61]But I should have real, real answers over the next probably three or four weeks.
[144:52.69]We'll see.
[144:55.05]But I appreciate it.
[144:56.41]Thank you, Dark Soul.
[144:58.64]Stefunky Chicken next to the 250.
[144:59.64]Hey, Jerm, I just finished shooting a short film I directed last weekend.
[145:04.48]And above all the production challenges, I now know the true power of catering.
[145:09.91]We're in post now, but I want to say that watching all the effort you put into your streams has really inspired me to apply myself in the work that I do.
[145:16.71]Thank you.
[145:18.57]Yes.
[145:21.61]Once you start crossing the amount of people that are on a project, once there's 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 people on a project, that's... You have to... People have to eat.
[145:40.34]Did you drink all your green juice?
[145:41.64]I did.
[145:41.90]It was absolutely fucking delicious.
[145:44.78]Thank you.
[145:45.90]Thank you for that.
[145:47.80]Green juice, MonkaS.
[145:54.34]Yes, it's green juice.
[145:55.52]It's like spinach and kale and... Agave.
[146:00.14]I don't know.
[146:02.97]It was very good.
[146:06.03]But... Yeah, when you have to feed people...
[146:11.64]It's very easy just to be like, should we have somebody go to Taco Bell and just get 60 crunch wraps?
[146:19.33]So catering really is so good.
[146:27.63]I wish you luck in your post.
[146:31.09]And I am honored to be inspiration for anything that you're doing.
[146:36.55]So thank you.
[146:38.25]Jerma lied about the ghost pepper.
[146:39.58]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[146:40.94]Looked it up for you.
[146:41.68]There's a place called JoJo's Jerky in Vegas and it sells ghost peppers.
[146:46.89]You're welcome.
[146:50.39]Hey, thanks.
[146:50.85]Appreciate it.
[146:58.55]I ain't gonna eat a ghost pepper on stream.
[147:01.52]It's not gonna happen.
[147:03.60]I need to get a clean bill of health from my current doctors before I die on stream eating a ghost pepper.
[147:13.96]Not gonna happen.
[147:17.08]Thank you, though.
[147:17.60]Appreciate it.
[147:18.18]You got a great username because that will be relevant until the stream is off.
[147:29.93]I mean, like, off-off.
[147:30.59]Well, thank you.
[147:38.42]Appreciate that.
[147:45.48]Thank you.
[147:46.08]Thank you, Grim, for the five dollars.
[147:48.89]Hope you fall in the black hole again.
[147:50.35]Yeah.
[147:51.45]Not kidding.
[147:51.97]Fall in the hole again.
[147:52.75]I did, like, four times.
[148:00.20]And then we had a shitload of community subs.
[148:03.12]You guys, sometimes you just go on a roll and I get like 400.
[148:07.23]That's ridiculous.
[148:11.75]That's ridiculous.
[148:15.07]I appreciate every single one of them.
[148:20.07]In fact, let's take a look and see how many people it was.
[148:33.17]Here we go.
[148:40.59]Ow.
[148:43.41]Wait, I need to log into here.
[148:47.95]Shit.
[148:48.79]Uh-oh.
[148:51.37]No!
[148:52.53]Oh, we're fine.
[148:53.39]No, we're not.
[148:59.99]Fucking Streamlabs.
[149:04.00]I have so many bad things to say about Streamlabs.
[149:09.53]Okay.
[149:12.27]Here we go.
[149:20.40]That's a lot.
[149:25.00]That's a lot of people.
[149:30.01]Thank you, all of you.
[149:30.98]Thank you specifically to not only the people that are in that list, but also the people that made the two, three hundred today even happen.
[149:39.06]Thank you, everybody that stays subbed, that subs ever, that maybe subbed like three years ago and never again.
[149:44.53]Thanks forever, ever.
[149:46.71]Thank you.
[149:53.08]Thank you anonymous for the 300 bits.
[149:54.56]Hey Jerma, it's the animal rescue guy.
[149:56.71]This will be my final message for a while as the rescue got more animals than expected.
[150:00.83]So I have to use a bunch of my money.
[150:03.93]Good, very good.
[150:05.13]Anyway, here's a picture of six baby ducks that I have hatched whose parents are the ones that you and its outs named.
[150:10.95]I'd say if you or chat want to name others, feel free.
[150:13.81]Oh, for reptiles, check out a leatherback bearded dragon.
[150:17.27]It's a new morph and is even tamer than regular beardies.
[150:22.92]I'm sorry, I did not hear huge monitor lizard in there.
[150:28.32]That's really good info, though, actually, because I was actually thinking about getting a bearded dragon.
[150:35.60]Oh, look at these ducks.
[150:37.24]Ducks are so precious.
[150:42.36]Look at these.
[150:44.71]They're so precious.
[150:54.52]Here is image one.
[150:55.42]I'll show after the credits roll.
[151:01.25]But we'll put these on screen.
[151:02.21]Thank you so much.
[151:03.03]And beautiful, awesome ducks.
[151:06.81]Thank you, Anonymous.
[151:09.13]And I will look into Leatherback Bearded Dragon.
[151:11.31]Because it was one of the things I was thinking about getting.
[151:15.70]Here they come.
[151:19.88]Here's duck image one.
[151:21.10]It's actually a lot bigger, so let's just get it up on the front.
[151:30.39]Wait, wait, there's more.
[151:31.45]Hold on.
[151:31.79]Look at these.
[151:42.28]They're all just huddled into a corner, just keeping each other warm.
[151:47.18]It's a fuzz pile.
[151:49.71]It's what happens when you get your hair cut at the barber.
[151:51.71]That's just what's on the ground.
[151:56.05]That's so cute.
[151:59.62]Hell yeah.
[152:00.82]Wow, I wish you luck.
[152:03.74]Keep doing the good stuff.
[152:07.44]Thank you, Anonymous.
[152:10.36]Hey, Vilemi, thanks for the hundred times ten.
[152:14.78]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[152:17.00]Make sure to get some chick stuff in Uranus.
[152:22.54]Thank you, Vilemi.
[152:23.36]I think I got a lot of cool things.
[152:26.00]I remember I did that.
[152:27.02]I did that very... Should I?
[152:29.76]Oh.
[152:33.72]What?
[152:34.90]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[152:37.86]Gnarly thanks for the 250.
[152:39.08]One time I put Tabasco on some ice cream at work.
[152:41.98]At a work Christmas party as a joke for my friends.
[152:44.18]It wasn't good.
[152:45.45]I think my boss saw me do it and he cringed.
[153:01.49]Alright, that's kind of embarrassing.
[153:04.35]Kind of cringy.
[153:08.61]What is this?
[153:09.25]Thoughts on Dijon... Wait, wait, wait.
[153:10.95]Somebody linked a clip.
[153:11.67]Apparently there's audio here I need to listen to.
[153:15.03]This says, thoughts on Dijon mustard from Stinky Beaver.
[153:18.00]Thanks for the $2.50, and it's a clip.
[153:19.44]What is it?
[153:25.78]Wait, what?
[153:33.21]Oh, you guys can't hear it.
[153:34.91]What am I supposed to do about this?
[153:54.01]There's nothing to see.
[153:54.73]It's just the sound.
[153:58.17]That says Jerma Horse.
[154:03.89]Here, see for yourself.
[154:09.81]I guess it's kind of horse-like.
[154:12.03]Yeah, thanks.
[154:12.71]Thoughts on Dijon mustard?
[154:13.86]You saw where it was on that list.
[154:15.06]It's very high.
[154:16.00]It's great.
[154:20.56]Thank you for the $2.50.
[154:23.68]But let me thank you for the 300 bits.
[154:24.82]They say, ay-ya-ya.
[154:28.03]Dave saved it, gave 5,000 bits.
[154:30.15]I think I caught this, but just in case I didn't, thank you, Dave.
[154:33.78]And they just say jermaHearts.
[154:35.98]Thank you.
[154:39.72]Pretty sure I touched upon it, but if I didn't, I'm sorry.
[154:42.82]That's a lot of money to miss.
[154:43.88]I don't think I did, though.
[154:45.80]And then he gave five community subs right after that.
[154:47.87]So, like, you just... Thank you.
[154:56.38]Vilemi, again, thanks for the 300 bits.
[154:57.86]Jerma, this does sound really fun, but if you're a fool... You're a fool if you think I'm not putting a bounty on the king's head.
[155:04.84]That's fine.
[155:07.68]Yeah, you don't think I've... What do you mean?
[155:09.38]You don't think I've got a vault full of gold behind me?
[155:12.78]Somebody comes in with a bow pointed at my head.
[155:14.80]I'll double it.
[155:15.56]What are you getting paid?
[155:16.78]I'll double it.
[155:17.86]No, no, no.
[155:18.26]Fuck that.
[155:19.04]I'll triple it.
[155:23.59]Go back and kill the man.
[155:26.91]That sent you.
[155:28.27]And I want proof.
[155:30.42]Bring me his diamond pickaxe.
[155:32.96]Oh!
[155:42.74]Snoozencopter, thanks for the $2.50.
[155:45.81]The video game tier list was a really nice trip down memory lane.
[155:49.81]Bloodborne and TF2 were the two games I would spend a ton of money on for a mind eraser frog.
[155:55.45]Yeah.
[155:57.10]Imagine picking up Team Fortress 2 for the first time ever right now.
[155:59.94]There's so much to see.
[156:05.75]I feel like it would actually be hard, though.
[156:07.87]Because we got all that stuff trickled in over years.
[156:12.13]It's almost like the game has changed a lot since then.
[156:14.85]It would be... It might be actually pretty difficult.
[156:22.97]But...
[156:24.34]God, I wish that they would just make Team Fortress, colon, man versus machine only.
[156:31.62]I would have loved them to just make just a... I'll pay for it.
[156:35.64]I'll buy it.
[156:37.15]Just sell it to me.
[156:40.33]It's $39.99, $59.99.
[156:41.09]I'll buy it.
[156:42.73]Just give it to me.
[156:49.15]Overwatch 2 is doing that.
[156:51.11]We don't know that for certain, though.
[157:00.17]We know it's a PvE game like that, but... Is it gonna be as good as Man vs. Machine was?
[157:08.00]Will it be as challenging?
[157:09.10]Will it be as fun?
[157:10.38]Will there be as much stuff to upgrade and enough in it?
[157:18.51]See?
[157:18.97]That's what I mean, we don't know.
[157:21.69]I'm not willing to judge until something's around, you know what I'm saying?
[157:30.65]Hey, I just made a burger, and I think the salad I used is a bit old.
[157:34.85]Three months old.
[157:37.27]Don't eat it.
[157:38.87]Just eat the burger.
[157:46.59]But... It's been years since I played the DLC in Bloodborne, and here comes a Bloodborne spoiler.
[157:54.54]Close your ears if you haven't played it yet.
[157:55.84]Here it comes.
[157:56.28]Three, two, one.
[157:57.92]I still haven't beaten the Orphan yet.
[157:59.36]I started the DLC in New Game Plus and later found out that New Game Plus Orphan is apparently much harder than normal Orphan.
[158:06.52]At this point, I'll have to see it.
[158:10.91]Well, a full day to beat it.
[158:13.65]Fuck me.
[158:15.53]Just mute me.
[158:26.15]Yes, Orphan was horrendous.
[158:32.97]I still would put him in the top two, top three of hardest bosses they've ever made.
[158:38.30]Number one is, by all means, the final boss in Sekiro was insane.
[158:51.78]That last true encounter in Sekiro was so much to learn and so much patience.
[159:09.01]Yeah, it was crazy.
[159:13.24]That was an entire stream, wasn't it?
[159:15.30]Just to try to beat that final boss.
[159:21.18]I sat there, I was at that boss for at least four hours, five hours, right?
[159:25.45]Something like that.
[159:29.81]Was it 50-something attempts?
[159:32.05]58, 60 attempts?
[159:35.00]Ugh.
[159:39.42]But, hey, I still did it, and I still enjoyed it.
[159:44.80]This next one... is... From Cyanide, thanks for the 500 bits.
[159:46.51]How to fix a round cage?
[160:13.20]This video has 12 million views.
[160:14.94]I think we got it.
[160:28.03]I think we got it.
[160:30.29]We got it.
[160:32.47]That's, that's, that's the best.
[160:42.13]That's just the, that is, you're right, that is the fucking stupid goddamn fucking dumb fucking thing.
[161:11.69]I fucking got it.
[161:12.53]Fucking stupid fucking thing.
[161:13.83]Fucking.
[161:16.65]That's so funny.
[161:18.57]It's true.
[161:23.85]I rate Donald Duck.
[161:26.75]And then finally.
[161:29.11]Thank you, Vilemi, for the 300 bits.
[161:30.83]It's a clip.
[161:31.57]It is a audio clip.
[161:36.01]I would like to see that.
[161:36.71]Links.
[161:41.74]Fuck.
[161:53.50]You have to have the context of whatever.
[161:55.04]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[162:01.13]We're gonna play Bumbo.
[162:04.39]So, that's either gonna be a three-hour, two-hour stream, or a, like, ten-hour stream.
[162:09.67]I'm not sure.
[162:12.56]Thanks again for all the insane support earlier.
[162:17.48]We have reached the end.
[162:19.86]See you tomorrow.
[162:22.01]Good night, everybody.
