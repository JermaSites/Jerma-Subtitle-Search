[00:03.90]Somebody said, wouldn't it be funny if we could collectively all not chat during the beginning of the stream and freak them out?
[00:12.63]You guys are coordinated.
[00:14.65]You're not that coordinated.
[00:17.51]It'd be impossible.
[00:20.25]Somebody would take that opportunity to make sure that they were the only person in chat.
[00:26.20]By the way, 3,000 of them are going to have that exact same idea.
[00:30.38]It'll never happen.
[00:34.62]It started to chant.
[00:35.24]What's the chant?
[00:39.26]Oh, yeah, but it doesn't matter.
[00:40.22]Look.
[00:44.16]Hey, boys.
[00:44.44]Hi.
[00:45.34]Hi.
[00:46.22]What was that?
[00:48.46]Hey, boys.
[00:48.78]Hi.
[00:49.17]How are you?
[00:49.69]How's everybody doing?
[00:51.97]Today, we're going to do something I've been putting off for the last three and a half weeks.
[00:56.53]This was actually a stream I was going to do.
[01:00.03]Before the Dollhouse stream.
[01:02.25]I believe.
[01:03.17]Or very, very soon right after it.
[01:05.53]But I didn't want to just be The Sims guy.
[01:07.28]Oh, I did.
[01:09.24]I played The Sims before the Dollhouse stream.
[01:11.10]And here I'm back after the Dollhouse stream.
[01:12.36]I'm going to play The Sims again.
[01:13.46]So I figured I'd hold on to it for a little bit.
[01:17.47]But this is going to be pretty interesting, I hope.
[01:19.81]Last time we did this, I may have given myself a hernia in The Sims 4.
[01:25.40]There's a specific point in time that I remember, and that is laughing at a dog peeing in the house.
[01:32.88]The guy was on drugs, took his dog for a walk in his house.
[01:38.95]And that was the hardest I've ever laughed in my whole life.
[01:43.09]I really think so.
[01:43.85]That was one of those times where I was laughing so hard that like the world collapses around you and you want to get out so bad.
[01:52.88]You want to pull the plug so bad, but you can't.
[01:54.42]You know what I'm talking about?
[01:56.86]Sure, you guys have heard me laugh on this channel like... I have control there.
[02:05.10]When you get into one of those laughing fits where you're out of control and you're not in control of your own body at all.
[02:12.30]Like, laughing is just like, please, I want it to stop.
[02:15.23]I would like for this to stop, please.
[02:17.63]But it doesn't.
[02:18.25]Nothing helps it.
[02:20.21]That happened during the guy walks his dog in his house routine.
[02:24.77]It may have given me a hernia.
[02:26.35]So, hernia part two incoming, maybe.
[02:29.55]It's not confirmed, by the way.
[02:30.63]I don't know if that really happened.
[02:31.67]I'm just saying it is.
[02:35.07]Um, but this is Sims 3, not The Sims 4.
[02:38.80]Hey, thank you, Y Honey, for the 10 communities up.
[02:41.78]Oh, I didn't even tweet.
[02:42.36]Where the fuck?
[02:44.52]Oh, yeah, I did.
[02:45.22]No, I didn't.
[02:45.62]I didn't press the button.
[02:49.46]There we go.
[02:52.59]But, uh, this one's a little different because... This one has a mod.
[02:58.79]I don't know how this is gonna work out.
[03:01.01]But... I guess... Should I even spoil it?
[03:04.07]I don't know.
[03:06.43]Oh, like the world can end.
[03:09.10]If I just start playing and all of a sudden the world ends, that's going to be kind of a waste of time.
[03:13.62]Oh, I don't have any sex mods.
[03:25.70]Spoilers, dude.
[03:26.82]Well, it hasn't even happened yet.
[03:33.26]Why would you want?
[03:36.22]Losing viewers.
[03:36.98]I just started the stream.
[03:38.56]No one's gonna just leave because there's no woohoo mod.
[03:46.82]A crushed lizard.
[03:47.68]Thanks for 20 community subs.
[03:49.30]Holy shit.
[03:51.24]Thank you.
[03:51.52]That's a lot.
[03:52.80]Thank you.
[03:58.57]Download them.
[03:59.67]No.
[04:05.90]I also got on this one, which is... I may have overdone it a little bit.
[04:11.56]I got that total complete control mod that's on The Sims 3.
[04:16.82]You can edit the actual creative sim file thing.
[04:21.47]And change the body sliders to be like times 5,000.
[04:23.71]That's active right now.
[04:26.83]It may be too much.
[04:28.77]And you'll see why in about 30 seconds.
[04:32.01]I'm just waiting.
[04:32.87]I'm waiting for people to trickle in.
[04:37.26]It's so much that it's not even funny.
[04:40.80]You can do it so far that the person turns into... I don't even know.
[04:46.29]They turn into their own solar system.
[04:52.97]Not the slider mods.
[04:56.98]What about the drugs mod?
[04:58.06]There is no drugs mod for Sims 3.
[05:02.06]At least not one that you can actually use.
[05:05.71]I think there's drug paraphernalia you can put in.
[05:09.99]And by the way, I haven't really tested these.
[05:12.06]I tested all of them like three and a half weeks ago.
[05:15.42]But I don't know.
[05:16.10]I'm going to be very surprised by you guys because I just put a shitload of stuff in here.
[05:19.12]I don't even remember what's in here.
[05:21.76]I mean, I don't know what's going to happen.
[05:23.86]I forget what's in here.
[05:24.68]Hopefully, I didn't add like a sex mod like as a joke for myself.
[05:29.47]Okay, hold on let's let's like let's go back here because Alright, you don't just you know what I meant by that though like oh just I Definitely didn't I'm certain of that because it pops up at the beginning and it says everything all the scripts are installed It's like oh you don't you've got like this this this this this none of them were on there don't worry I was just I was such a for a joke.
[05:58.67]Oh
[06:03.35]right here we go I think there's enough people here we can just kind of go for it and and hello hello oh there it is alright so uh let's just very very quickly
[06:28.25]I just got in to make sure we were ready, because when you have mods, it takes a long time to load the game.
[06:33.38]Where's the music?
[06:34.62]I've been in the menu for too long.
[06:36.32]Let's just go ahead and show you what can happen here if I do this.
[06:44.99]To the point where it doesn't make any sense.
[06:47.19]They turn into like an N64 polygon.
[06:56.52]You can make it huge.
[06:57.98]But look at how far these bars go.
[06:59.82]I overdid it a lot.
[07:01.46]Somebody just gave a shitload of subs and it immediately got removed.
[07:07.86]What was it?
[07:10.25]Autumn just gave five subs.
[07:11.25]Somebody just gave a shitload.
[07:12.51]Who just gave that?
[07:13.77]Alright, so I gotta figure out what I want to do here.
[07:18.81]What do I want to do?
[07:21.39]Oh, it's Nuclear Waffle.
[07:22.74]Okay, 50 subs.
[07:23.42]Holy shit, Nuclear Waffle.
[07:28.25]Jesus.
[07:30.96]Okay, one thing that's important too is, I know, look, people are going to think this is really funny, and I do too.
[07:38.32]Take a look at this.
[07:40.22]This is a baby.
[07:43.69]You can, it's pretty much, you can do anything.
[07:50.07]It's too extreme, but we can make a weird baby.
[07:52.63]I kind of want like a huge chin baby.
[08:00.63]It can go as far down or... Oh my god.
[08:02.59]Oh my god, I already like it.
[08:11.70]It looks so under... It's turning into the scream face.
[08:27.76]Alright, no, okay, I'm gonna make somebody a urinal.
[08:30.47]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[08:31.57]Everybody relax.
[08:32.31]I'm gonna make a urinal.
[08:33.69]The name's gonna be like Bob Urinal.
[08:36.87]Okay, not the baby, though.
[08:38.37]I'm gonna make a urinal.
[08:42.57]Go back.
[08:43.20]Basics.
[08:46.70]Okay, this guy's name is gonna be like, I don't know, Urinal.
[08:53.28]I'll work on, look, I gotta do this one at a time.
[08:55.18]I don't even know what family this is.
[09:05.08]I gotta change this a little bit.
[09:06.06]It needs to be a urinal.
[09:10.15]There's no music.
[09:11.17]This makes this way creepier than it has to be.
[09:15.59]It's probably wider than that, right?
[09:20.52]That looks alright.
[09:23.90]I need a family name.
[09:27.00]Put on music.
[09:27.62]I was in the menu for too long, that's why.
[09:31.22]The head needs to be... Oh, this has to be lower.
[09:33.29]And this has to be longer.
[09:35.78]And actually this needs to be wider too, hold on.
[09:40.33]Not that wide.
[09:44.03]That's way too much.
[09:47.85]That's pretty good.
[09:54.22]Little bit more.
[09:57.68]Make this guy's name Urine Earl.
[10:03.64]I put his head, now this part of his face has to be a little wider, too.
[10:08.10]Like that.
[10:13.64]Alright, does anybody else hope that, like, fucking Gary Urinal dies first?
[10:25.48]Urine Earl.
[10:29.96]Oh, that's to be in, like that.
[10:31.24]Okay, that's better.
[10:33.56]This needs to be way taller.
[10:35.11]Hold on.
[10:35.91]Face height.
[10:36.37]There we go.
[10:39.73]Holy shit.
[10:44.61]Oh, I don't like this.
[10:46.67]I hate this.
[10:55.84]It looks like it's Quagmire.
[11:02.24]Our urinals are not... Yeah, that's okay.
[11:04.52]It's not quagmire.
[11:05.40]I'll fix it.
[11:05.74]What about his ears?
[11:08.94]What the fuck?
[11:12.74]Ears orbit?
[11:13.50]Oh, they can spin around.
[11:14.32]Ears point?
[11:17.16]I'm just making an orc.
[11:18.34]Okay.
[11:30.50]I kind of like it.
[11:31.14]I don't hate it.
[11:35.31]Oh, what's his name?
[11:36.16]From Jack and Dexter.
[11:37.96]No, from Ratchet and Clank.
[11:39.40]What's his name?
[11:40.02]Do you know the one I'm talking about?
[11:41.10]What's his name?
[11:41.62]What's his name?
[11:42.78]Which one is it?
[11:43.32]It's one of them.
[11:48.71]No, not Baby Yoda.
[11:50.23]What?
[11:50.55]Ratchet.
[11:51.01]Yeah, there it is.
[11:52.01]This is Ratchet from Ratchet and Clank.
[11:53.37]Ratchet Urinal.
[11:58.83]I like it.
[11:59.15]I need to, like, look up.
[12:03.50]Oh, my God.
[12:03.84]Do I have this wrong?
[12:06.50]Ratchet and Clank.
[12:10.46]And Clank.
[12:12.06]This is who I'm thinking of, right?
[12:14.68]Yes, it is.
[12:15.24]Of course it is.
[12:15.78]That's Ratchet from Ratchet and Clank.
[12:21.06]What about the... Hold on.
[12:23.13]The eyes.
[12:24.73]Eyebrows.
[12:25.17]I like that.
[12:30.45]I need some... I need the music back.
[12:32.11]This feels weird that you're watching me do this without the music.
[12:35.05]The music makes this fine.
[12:45.51]How about right there?
[12:47.81]Is it orc?
[12:55.34]It's a... It's a... It's a chihuahua?
[12:58.90]It's not a chihuahua.
[13:03.44]Oh, I like the flat.
[13:04.49]Yeah.
[13:05.29]It looks like the eagle from the Muppets that doesn't take shit from anybody.
[13:07.63]Alright.
[13:11.61]Nose bridge?
[13:12.97]I don't even... What is that even... What is that even doing?
[13:20.11]Bridge height?
[13:21.64]Oh, that just like carves a space in his eyebrows.
[13:29.74]I actually kind of like that.
[13:30.78]Wait, I need the music right now.
[13:34.94]Music.
[13:37.26]Alright, let's go.
[13:38.42]Where is it?
[13:45.67]Alright, that's way too loud.
[13:51.41]I like it.
[13:55.59]I put it on.
[14:00.20]See, now it's not weird anymore.
[14:01.94]You understand?
[14:03.22]Before it was a creepy weird guy making like creations in his fucking basement.
[14:06.66]Now this is like a fun family fun thing we're doing.
[14:09.90]This is now not weird anymore.
[14:11.94]This is funny and interesting.
[14:13.36]Look like.
[14:13.68]I like that.
[14:20.49]Can they even talk?
[14:21.25]This is too loud, though.
[14:24.38]Is this even a song that I picked?
[14:25.50]The nose is never gonna be... Oh my god, no.
[14:37.41]What does Ratchet's nose look like?
[14:38.59]Let me see.
[14:40.99]What does Ratchet's face look like?
[14:46.62]Alright, it's kind of like down and it's forward.
[14:49.88]It's like down here.
[15:01.31]It's like a little point that goes down kind of below.
[15:03.59]Is there like a height?
[15:07.08]I'll have to hear that.
[15:12.78]Nose scale... Nah, it's gotta be nose height.
[15:18.91]Nose meh.
[15:24.73]I mean, that does not look like Ratchet.
[15:26.48]It's too big.
[15:33.60]What does his face look like?
[15:34.38]Oh, he's got big eyes.
[15:35.14]It's the eyes.
[15:39.08]Here we go.
[15:40.10]Alien eyes?
[15:40.84]Eye scale, there it is.
[15:55.83]Oh, this feels like one of those... Oh, no.
[15:57.89]Okay, here we go.
[16:01.33]We forgot to... What?
[16:02.19]What did I forget to do?
[16:05.96]How high are his eyes?
[16:14.69]Looks like a Furby?
[16:15.81]It does look like a Furby.
[16:16.93]Okay, his mouth is a little bigger.
[16:25.40]Alright, well if he's a Furby- Alright.
[16:29.04]This is just a test.
[16:30.04]I haven't really played with these that much.
[16:33.88]Mouth corner depth.
[16:34.82]Hold on.
[16:38.92]This is the guy from Family Guy.
[16:40.36]Like this.
[16:42.88]I'm gonna change that though, it's not the same guy.
[16:44.52]Oh, I kinda like this.
[16:47.38]I don't mind that.
[17:12.05]I don't want it to be, oh look, we can't go too ridiculous if we can't see them.
[17:20.11]Like, that's ridiculous.
[17:21.01]This is, this is like not as ridiculous.
[17:27.19]I'm gonna say, like, right here.
[17:33.99]The bottom lip has to come in.
[17:35.99]Make Stewie.
[17:37.05]No!
[17:37.53]Alright, fine.
[17:38.11]That's actually kind of funny.
[17:38.97]I'll make, I'll make Stewie.
[17:46.87]I need to drop something here, because look, I don't want all the artifacting.
[17:50.89]Yeah, the bottom lip has to come in, because it's way too high.
[17:58.04]How about like this?
[18:04.00]No.
[18:06.60]No, it's all fucked up somewhere.
[18:08.38]I don't know where.
[18:09.78]Where am I getting the double bottom chin thing?
[18:17.63]The hair is going to be interesting.
[18:18.82]Oh, I thought this was... I was about to sing the song.
[18:21.24]It's not the song.
[18:24.50]Okay, let's just... I'm done with this one.
[18:26.84]This is a test.
[18:27.42]I don't want it to be... Okay, that's fine.
[18:30.55]This is an episode of the Twilight Zone.
[18:47.34]No, not randomized.
[18:48.26]Alright, what's his family?
[18:51.98]What's his family?
[18:56.39]I'm not making the Griffin family.
[19:07.64]The human family.
[19:09.26]He's human?
[19:19.01]Alright, not the Albertsons.
[19:20.94]This music is fucking loud, man.
[19:23.16]Hold on.
[19:26.42]I know I wanted it, but seriously.
[19:30.48]Jesus.
[19:31.04]That's better.
[19:31.60]Oh, that's... No, that's way too low.
[19:33.60]Okay, that's good.
[19:34.56]How about... I mean, this is...
[19:48.77]Ratchet Urinal.
[19:53.21]Um, that's, who cares?
[19:54.59]It's just Ratchet.
[20:07.44]Ratchet Urinal.
[20:10.34]So, no, the last name's not going to be Urinal.
[20:17.46]The last name can't be Urinal.
[20:19.38]That's... Is that that funny?
[20:22.74]That's that funny to you guys?
[20:24.08]Is that their last name is the Urinal family?
[20:29.78]No, it's not.
[20:30.42]It's not.
[20:40.01]Flush family.
[20:44.55]To me, that's funnier than Urinal.
[20:51.58]How about Ratchet Flush?
[20:54.83]Guys, don't worry.
[20:55.99]They're all dead in less than 40 minutes.
[20:57.95]So don't worry.
[20:58.45]We're going to do this again.
[20:59.85]Who cares about the Flush family?
[21:02.01]Nobody.
[21:04.97]We're going to do it again.
[21:13.70]Okay.
[21:15.24]I need to do clothes.
[21:16.38]Hair and clothes.
[21:22.07]Let me take the hat off.
[21:27.89]By the way, I have almost every single expansion I think in the game.
[21:37.52]I want to take the hat off.
[21:39.98]Okay.
[21:52.56]Good lord.
[21:54.24]Hold on.
[21:56.44]Wait, I just want hair.
[21:57.44]Take the hat off.
[21:58.12]How do I take off the hat?
[22:04.72]Hair.
[22:07.14]Why is this the only hair I have?
[22:14.41]Right next to it?
[22:16.71]Hair with accessories.
[22:19.85]Tabs?
[22:23.01]Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[22:23.81]How do I get this off?
[22:27.47]Am I insane?
[22:32.94]How do I just remove the hat?
[22:34.18]To the left?
[22:35.52]How do you take hats off?
[22:42.82]Click it twice.
[22:44.48]You don't take the hat off.
[22:54.00]Is it just a re- Just take- Oh wait, this is just hair?
[23:00.08]So just leave that.
[23:03.18]Why can't I just take the hat off?
[23:06.07]Alright, well whatever.
[23:11.69]The left hair tab is normal.
[23:14.53]Hair with accept- Oh, okay, I thought this was hats, not like hair and hats.
[23:29.59]I hate all of these.
[23:30.38]I don't want any of these.
[23:31.16]This is so messy.
[23:36.54]Hold on, we need, like... What does Ratchet have for, like, hair?
[23:44.86]Like, orange, right?
[23:46.10]Like, yellow, orange?
[23:58.07]Technically, it would just be bald.
[24:02.43]Has he got a hat on?
[24:03.15]He does?
[24:04.91]Oh, he does have a hat.
[24:16.24]It's the guy, it's the dog from Spaceballs.
[24:19.89]Barf, is who you're talking about.
[24:21.11]And yes, it is.
[24:23.37]Let me see if they have a little thing like that.
[24:28.19]Uh, do they have something like that?
[24:29.37]Does it really matter?
[24:30.22]Like this?
[24:38.72]Would this work?
[24:46.13]No.
[24:49.07]No, we're just going with the hair.
[24:57.36]It does look more like a Furby than Ratchet, you're right.
[24:59.18]But it doesn't matter.
[24:59.76]Okay, any of these are fine.
[25:11.13]This one's fine.
[25:14.63]Make the cast of Spaceballs.
[25:16.77]No.
[25:17.01]Okay, that's fine.
[25:20.41]Eyebrow is... I mean, you can't even see them.
[25:22.77]It doesn't really matter.
[25:23.43]What about a beard?
[25:26.67]This is not going to make any sense.
[25:27.61]Considering where it is.
[25:29.51]Although it kind of does.
[25:30.37]I don't look like George Lucas.
[25:35.64]In like the 70s.
[25:36.38]No.
[25:49.33]No facial hair.
[25:51.23]Alright, good.
[25:51.85]Cool.
[25:55.05]What about clothes?
[26:06.86]No clothes?
[26:08.40]I'm gonna... I mean, I have to put clothes on.
[26:10.14]Oh!
[26:14.15]Is it, like, an unpopular opinion for me to say I don't care about any of the clothing in The Simpsons?
[26:20.47]Like, is that... I mean, is that kind of bad for me to say?
[26:23.65]Uh-huh.
[26:24.98]Every single sim I've ever made could just wear a white t-shirt and that's it and I don't even care.
[26:29.48]I like never cared about the clothes.
[26:37.14]Is there like just an option where you can randomize their clothes?
[26:39.37]Actually, let's do... A guy with a rose?
[26:46.81]Alright, rose.
[26:51.79]This is just every day.
[26:53.60]Like, everybody's gonna spin around and wear the same pajamas.
[26:56.40]Who cares?
[26:56.78]Normal.
[27:00.24]Look, it's gonna be just a normal... Normal, right?
[27:03.26]Yeah.
[27:03.68]Yeah, that's... Um... What just happened?
[27:08.87]Normal?
[27:09.21]Okay, um... What is it?
[27:14.33]Sleepwear?
[27:14.85]Yeah.
[27:16.41]Oh, Jesus.
[27:16.63]Okay.
[27:27.22]This is athletic.
[27:31.10]This is swimwear.
[27:32.74]Yeah, whatever.
[27:35.12]Every day, you can just be the guy wearing these clothes.
[27:38.93]Holy shit, he was jacked.
[27:41.97]This dude, absolutely without a doubt in my mind, carries a pocket watch in his pocket.
[27:49.23]And makes a real clear, clear view for everybody to see that they're taking it out and looking at it all the time.
[27:57.24]Alright, uh, I don't even know what this person's name was.
[27:58.70]Alright, personality.
[28:05.90]Uh, couch potato, that's fine.
[28:07.14]Heavy sleeper, that's fine.
[28:09.18]Uh, traits.
[28:11.94]Clumsy, that's fine.
[28:12.84]Is that not?
[28:17.84]Oh, I didn't put it on.
[28:18.45]Alright, how about, uh, mental, let's see.
[28:21.11]Bookworm, can't, I thought this said can't, no.
[28:23.53]Computer whiz.
[28:30.61]I don't- what's my brain doing?
[28:31.89]I thought it said exotic.
[28:32.81]I was like, what?
[28:34.97]Excitable.
[28:35.91]I'm like combining words.
[28:48.06]When words are this close to each other- did anybody else get this problem?
[28:51.34]When words are this close and this small font, they can kind of like- I read it like the other way.
[28:57.02]Is that weird?
[29:03.62]Alright, unstable for sure.
[29:09.79]Afraid of water?
[29:11.89]Terrified of swimming.
[29:12.97]Alright, definitely charismatic.
[29:18.80]And I would say dramatic.
[29:24.19]Alright, do I look good?
[29:27.87]Super popular.
[29:28.51]It doesn't matter.
[29:29.25]A meteor is going to probably hit the house.
[29:31.15]So it doesn't really matter what his aspirations are.
[29:35.99]Favorite food, dim sum.
[29:37.89]Okay.
[29:39.45]Favorite music, roots.
[29:42.21]Favorite color, red.
[29:43.59]Okay.
[29:44.67]Let's do voice.
[29:45.11]That's fine.
[29:54.82]Astrological sign, uh, Sagittarius.
[29:58.28]That looks good.
[30:04.22]Okay.
[30:05.30]That's, uh, oh yeah, the name was the Flushes, okay.
[30:08.80]Uh, let's do another one.
[30:11.02]Add Sim or Pet.
[30:12.50]Oh, please.
[30:13.18]Oh, God.
[30:13.64]Wait, create a dog, create a horse.
[30:14.98]We can have a horse in the house.
[30:16.82]We can have a horse in the house.
[30:17.78]I just want everyone to be aware of that.
[30:25.24]Okay, here we go.
[30:30.64]Okay, let's go... How about just like... Somebody that's way too jacked.
[30:41.61]This just reminds me of... That's huge.
[30:47.75]I'm gonna make me.
[30:56.36]Let's just be so defined.
[30:57.86]I want to be like the people of those competitions where they don't look human.
[31:03.77]They're covered in like oil.
[31:07.15]Like they were sculpted out of clay or something or out of like Play-Doh.
[31:14.28]There.
[31:14.84]Look, look, look, look, look.
[31:17.46]There.
[31:18.62]Now it makes sense.
[31:27.58]I want to see him without a shirt on.
[31:29.88]So bad.
[31:35.72]Let's not go too ridiculous.
[31:37.19]Just ridiculous enough where it's funny.
[31:49.22]This is uncanny.
[31:50.26]Mr. Satan.
[31:51.92]Well, not yet.
[31:53.06]I gotta be in this house.
[31:56.31]What did 2012 Jerma hair look like?
[31:58.51]I don't remember.
[31:58.91]It was kind of short, right?
[32:00.43]It was like this?
[32:02.17]No, like this?
[32:10.85]I feel like it was kind of like that.
[32:15.14]It was shorter, though.
[32:22.52]That's kind of close.
[32:26.50]spiked at the front and shaved on the sides I don't know if they have a hairstyle like that I mean not like this would be I passed it I didn't that's not the haircut I had in 2012.
[32:57.73]I'm just gonna pick this one.
[33:00.19]This one or this one.
[33:03.93]It was something like, yeah, it was like this.
[33:08.89]Looks good, okay.
[33:11.44]Eyebrows.
[33:11.98]I have pretty thick eyebrows.
[33:14.68]I gotta, this is pretty much what my beard looks like.
[33:17.24]Although I didn't really have that.
[33:20.48]Body hair.
[33:23.04]Okay, here we go.
[33:23.50]This is important.
[33:31.79]I'm just gonna be the only, like, normal-looking person in the house.
[33:40.96]It's just... It's not even close.
[33:43.20]This is Randy Orton.
[33:47.90]Forget it.
[33:48.20]This is Randy Orton.
[33:49.03]This is not even me.
[33:50.23]I'm changing it to Randy Orton.
[34:00.48]It's normal.
[34:02.52]Should I just... No, make it Jerma.
[34:05.22]Stick to Jerma.
[34:09.22]Look at the mirror.
[34:15.35]Okay.
[34:16.55]Put the music back on.
[34:17.61]I hate that it's not doing this without music.
[34:22.57]It's weird without the music.
[34:29.29]Is... No, where's my music?
[34:31.09]I was gonna say it's weird without music, but it's weirder with, like, classical music.
[34:37.95]What's this one on?
[34:45.56]Oh, create a sim.
[34:46.10]Here we go.
[34:53.58]I think this is just... I can't, like, delete these.
[34:55.68]Oh, whatever.
[34:57.65]Who cares?
[35:00.84]Alright, let's do... How wide can I make somebody's head without it destroying everything?
[35:06.18]Alright, hold on.
[35:22.17]Put it back.
[35:23.43]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[35:35.41]What's going on with the forehead?
[35:37.16]Where's his eye?
[35:38.74]It's the eyebrow I think is coming down too far.
[35:42.64]I'm trying to get the eyes to be open.
[35:45.40]No, it's impossible.
[36:05.72]Shit.
[36:05.96]I gotta go back.
[36:06.70]How do I go back?
[36:07.92]How do I go back?
[36:14.56]How do I- is it control Z?
[36:21.47]Okay.
[36:23.31]I can go a little wider than that.
[36:24.45]At least I think so.
[36:34.83]Isn't this like a meme image?
[36:46.23]Okay.
[36:55.06]Now don't go too wild here.
[36:56.40]I don't want it to be too outrageous.
[37:02.86]I want to see his face.
[37:12.26]What does this look like?
[37:13.75]This looks like somebody.
[37:14.91]Okay, jaw depth.
[37:23.97]No, no, no.
[37:27.78]By the way, I promise I will make at least one, like, exploding person.
[37:33.68]But it can't be everybody.
[37:41.71]Remove the hair.
[37:42.43]And it's Joe Rogan.
[37:45.71]No, it's not.
[37:48.91]Oh, that's a facial hair.
[38:02.71]Oh, I mean, no, it's not really.
[38:09.15]Well, we gotta put hair.
[38:17.10]It's the... It's the... It's from a... It's from a claymation movie.
[38:24.52]What the fuck is the name of that movie?
[38:26.00]It's from a... Like a stop-motion movie.
[38:29.10]No, no, no, no.
[38:30.38]That... Tim Burton movie?
[38:38.00]Paranorman.
[38:38.74]That's the one.
[38:40.10]Yep.
[38:40.56]It's one of the guys from Paranorman.
[38:49.92]It needs to be a little thinner in the head, but it's one of the... It's like the guy with the big long head, and he's a big tough guy or something.
[38:57.19]I never saw the movie.
[39:03.51]Kind of like this.
[39:04.13]And that's what's going to stay.
[39:23.69]I'm rooting for this character, by the way.
[39:27.35]I want this character to make it.
[39:28.73]Alright, we're not done with the face.
[39:31.39]Holy shit.
[39:54.40]Okay, I like it.
[39:55.50]Looks good.
[39:59.14]Not extreme jowls.
[40:00.23]No, thank you.
[40:06.95]This is barbecue football dad.
[40:08.65]You mean the dad always manning the grill at every family get-together?
[40:20.53]Oh, I'll do you one up.
[40:22.59]Dad, that always at dinner, always, no matter what they're eating, it could be, you could be at, like, Chili's or, like, a five-star restaurant.
[40:30.66]They eat something that they like.
[40:32.82]Oh, that's, oh, that's unfair.
[40:34.92]Oh, that's unfair.
[40:36.10]That's unfair.
[40:37.52]Oh, this should be illegal.
[40:39.80]Like, you like it, I guess.
[40:42.44]Oh, man, this, this, that's unfair.
[40:46.59]Dad, you've had the southwestern egg rolls from Chili's.
[40:50.23]Like 40 times.
[40:55.05]They're good.
[40:55.47]They're really good.
[40:57.87]Alright, let's keep going.
[41:05.78]Looks like Henry VIII.
[41:09.79]I want to see.
[41:11.77]I want to see what Henry VIII looks like.
[41:18.57]Oh, that's also the same dad who, every time you go on vacation, and they really like where they are, they'll point at residential areas around the place where you are a tourist.
[41:31.47]Oh, man.
[41:31.91]Imagine that in your backyard.
[41:35.07]Imagine having this in your backyard.
[41:38.13]Oh, man.
[41:38.51]Imagine having that right in your backyard.
[41:43.31]Yeah, the Eiffel Tower is there, and then people live over there.
[41:48.43]Oh, it's beautiful.
[41:50.61]Imagine having this in your backyard.
[41:55.80]Yeah.
[41:57.24]Hey, Dad.
[42:00.66]Now you're reaching.
[42:02.34]No, it's true.
[42:02.94]Alright, I want to leave this alone.
[42:08.28]I think he's perfect.
[42:13.83]How much that house over there cost.
[42:15.27]Yeah, they always want to know how much the real estate is.
[42:20.34]And it's either way too much or way too little.
[42:23.86]Imagine paying fucking 600 grand for that house.
[42:26.72]Stupid.
[42:27.24]These people are fucking idiots.
[42:28.28]These people are idiots.
[42:30.50]What?
[42:31.84]110,000 for that house?
[42:32.77]Oh my fucking god, they have it easy here.
[42:34.67]So easy.
[42:35.49]It's so simple for you guys here.
[42:39.67]Like, I...
[42:52.52]Boop, boop, boop, boop!
[42:55.24]Can we make a Psycbops?
[43:04.29]No, no, no.
[43:04.93]It was perfect where it was.
[43:06.15]Leave it.
[43:14.14]Oh, pfft.
[43:15.56]That's dad when he sees Southwestern Eggrolls?
[43:18.42]Whoa, meme image!
[43:23.66]Dad, when I get straight A's on fucking my last test.
[43:29.46]Oh, Dad, when it's 50% off Southwestern Egg Rolls night.
[43:32.22]Alright, I got to calm down.
[43:38.77]I'm too energetic right now.
[43:47.27]Okay, it looks good.
[43:48.17]It looks good.
[43:48.77]I think everything's perfect.
[43:49.47]I don't want to do anything else.
[43:50.89]Maybe a little bit with my mouth.
[43:52.55]Just a little.
[43:56.47]Not that much.
[43:57.18]Don't rule.
[43:57.96]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[43:59.62]Actually.
[44:01.58]It actually kind of works.
[44:02.22]This person is wearing somebody else's skin.
[44:29.33]No, it's perfect right there.
[44:31.77]Everything's perfect.
[44:32.31]I don't touch anything, it's over.
[44:34.67]Alright, who is this person?
[44:41.37]I'm starting to feel like a song coming on.
[44:46.26]I feel pretty good.
[44:52.56]Never mind, it's the wrong song.
[44:55.28]Alright, every day, let's just put on every day.
[45:02.34]Now it is Henry VIII.
[45:08.26]I kind of want to keep it.
[45:15.70]Alright.
[45:18.34]Those legs though.
[45:19.64]Yeah, I know.
[45:21.74]I want to see swimwear because I want to see how huge he is.
[45:25.48]Arms a cheek.
[45:26.54]What?
[45:30.31]Why are you in a wetsuit?
[45:37.17]Um... Wet suit?
[45:40.96]I want him to be in, like, a bathing suit.
[45:48.30]Make the sus guy.
[45:49.26]I will.
[45:50.16]I will.
[45:50.72]They're dead first, though.
[45:53.47]It's under bottoms.
[45:59.17]Oh, outfits, I see.
[46:00.09]Okay.
[46:03.07]Oh.
[46:05.09]Jesus.
[46:06.61]Oh.
[46:11.23]He's got a really small ass.
[46:15.22]Do you see that?
[46:16.84]That seems... That's weird.
[46:20.36]Why is his ass so small?
[46:23.34]And the connecting part to his ass to his legs is enormous.
[46:25.95]Okay, that looks good.
[46:32.45]Let's have the bottoms be...
[46:40.90]Good.
[46:43.92]Accessories.
[46:44.60]I want, like, a pair of goggles.
[46:45.64]Okay.
[46:45.74]I don't want to put his head.
[46:48.22]That's perfect.
[46:50.10]Oh, what?
[46:50.36]Maybe we should put glasses on to go swimming.
[46:52.94]What is that?
[46:53.92]What is that?
[46:55.88]What is it?
[46:56.64]Gills?
[47:13.95]Alright, I like that.
[47:14.55]That looks good.
[47:16.33]Uh, outerwear, like wintertime.
[47:17.77]Okay, I can, it can be, this is fine.
[47:30.00]Actually, hold on.
[47:30.54]I want, what about like a, like one of these?
[47:32.30]That's what he has on right now.
[47:36.31]Okay.
[47:38.37]Final Fantasy VII, dad.
[47:43.62]Oh, just wait.
[47:44.52]We'll make Final Fantasy VII, Dad.
[47:49.53]This is an actual Nickelodeon character?
[47:51.69]Who?
[47:51.77]Oh wait, it is!
[48:02.01]It's Arty!
[48:03.53]Strongest man in the world.
[48:05.69]But he actually is huge.
[48:11.93]Okay, we need some info.
[48:12.99]This is no longer this person.
[48:17.72]Oh, man, I have no idea.
[48:22.72]I don't... I have no idea what this person's name is.
[48:24.50]This... We... This person was four different people.
[48:30.28]Henry, the eighth strongest man in the world?
[48:34.50]Would...
[48:41.11]Henry, the eighth strongest dad in the world?
[48:58.81]Henry flushed.
[49:00.36]I mean, Henry's fine.
[49:02.60]How about strong Henry?
[49:06.38]Strong Henry flushed.
[49:14.57]Enry the last.
[49:21.78]Alright, looks good.
[49:23.46]I like the... Okay, alright, let's keep going.
[49:26.38]We're gonna add... We're gonna make the sus guy.
[49:28.88]And you bet your ass that within five seconds of loading into the game, I'm gonna literally just, like, blow him up.
[49:36.82]Okay.
[49:45.07]Here comes the sus guy.
[49:52.09]Sus flush.
[49:54.07]Oh man, I had one of those yesterday.
[49:55.49]What does that even mean?
[50:00.51]In the moment, that sounded like a decent thing to say.
[50:02.26]I don't even know what that means.
[50:03.90]You had a sus flush, which means you had diarrhea.
[50:06.18]I don't even know.
[50:07.86]That just kind of came out of nowhere.
[50:08.84]I don't know what I meant by that one.
[50:18.14]He filled the bowl so it didn't go down.
[50:22.10]Sussy, flushy.
[50:23.20]Alright, here you go, sus.
[50:30.05]Let's make the sus guy an adult as he is.
[50:32.73]Yeah, this really kind of goes down to what we can do with the face here.
[50:42.17]Alright, let's take the hair off.
[50:47.32]Zah's hair was, um... It was really all over the place, right?
[50:53.07]It kind of looked like that.
[50:53.93]Like that.
[50:58.43]That's pretty close.
[50:59.79]Alright, I need to... Okay, I know what it looks like.
[51:06.39]Let's go with mouth.
[51:11.21]Mouth corners rotate like this.
[51:15.24]Mouth curve, like that.
[51:21.48]Mouth definition, mouth depth.
[51:23.46]This way, don't worry.
[51:34.43]Uh, didn't really work the way that I wanted it to.
[51:38.93]I'll get it to work.
[51:43.90]I don't think I can make his teeth bigger.
[51:45.34]It just looks like a duck.
[51:47.72]Get a reference pick?
[51:49.22]Yeah, I got one.
[51:50.76]I just can't make the teeth bigger.
[52:12.29]the reference image up here?
[52:14.09]Uh, yeah, I will.
[52:15.13]Makes sense.
[52:16.19]Uh, what do I just type into Google?
[52:19.49]Suss guy?
[52:19.99]That should pop up, right?
[52:22.36]There it is.
[52:25.56]Jesus.
[52:29.92]Uh, suss guy.
[52:30.88]Jerma suss.
[52:34.65]Okay.
[52:49.24]Where'd it go?
[52:59.97]I still look at this and I just get, I'm just like, what the fuck?
[53:02.73]You know what I mean?
[53:16.83]It's the eyes.
[53:17.41]The eyes are going to be really fucked up too.
[53:18.85]Okay.
[53:21.09]What just happened?
[53:24.21]Alright, this is, uh, the chin needs to come down a lot.
[53:29.49]Face height.
[53:37.03]Chin has to come down.
[53:46.28]Not that.
[53:46.82]It's only like this.
[53:47.50]It all has to come in a little.
[53:56.22]Looks good.
[53:56.62]I fucking hate this image.
[54:05.04]No, I had it right.
[54:06.84]Right there.
[54:07.20]Okay.
[54:07.78]Chin under lip depth.
[54:12.04]Oh, right.
[54:12.38]This is like... Okay, no, no, no, no.
[54:13.18]I don't want to screw this up.
[54:15.29]Like that.
[54:19.13]The jaw is... Turn off the cam.
[54:24.33]I need it as a reference.
[54:33.48]Oh!
[54:36.08]Oh, God!
[54:37.14]It's a Bob's Burgers character.
[54:40.38]Did I make the Bob's Burgers sus guy?
[54:50.82]Oh, it's too far.
[54:51.92]It's, like, right there.
[54:53.06]How far is it?
[55:00.17]Okay, from the nose to the mouth is pretty short.
[55:02.79]It's gonna open that mouth.
[55:13.56]Uh...
[55:18.98]nose is too small I know I'm working on it I think when he talks he'll open his mouth right cheekbone height stay down like this cheekbone shape pull it out a little bit that looks fine
[55:43.34]Fine.
[55:45.20]That looks fine.
[55:46.76]Ears are fine.
[55:47.52]Alright, eyes.
[55:49.37]Eye depth?
[55:52.97]They're probably coming out a little bit.
[55:59.00]Eye distance?
[56:00.02]They're tilted a little bit, too.
[56:15.56]And I have to tilt at the corners.
[56:24.66]Where are they rotated?
[56:25.52]Like this, right?
[56:27.62]Just a little.
[56:30.12]Attack on Titan.
[56:31.14]How is this Attack on Titan?
[56:38.32]Oh my god.

[57:32.41]Alright, the nose has to be bigger.
[57:39.86]Looks fine.
[57:42.78]Okay, now we gotta go here.
[58:06.12]If it's down, it is down.
[58:11.05]Not that far.

[58:52.53]How do I do this?
[58:53.11]Jesus, that's terrifying.
[59:16.14]It'll work when he talks.
[59:19.52]Skin mustache.
[59:20.98]Yeah, it'll work when he talks.
[59:28.55]This doesn't need to be that high, though.
[59:32.43]Yeah, that looked way too ridiculous.
[59:33.83]Let's put this down.
[59:45.10]I feel like I have like weird like flesh wings on like a skin mustache.
[59:49.44]It is.
[59:50.22]Oh my god.
[59:50.72]That's so fucked up looking It's a stairs a skin mustache, I don't know how to get rid of that I'm gonna change the hair

[60:19.50]Alright, I need... That looks fine.
[60:24.92]Alright, we gotta change the hair.
[60:31.97]No.
[60:34.93]It's really messy.
[60:39.57]Turn down the corners.
[60:41.15]I don't think I even can at this point.
[60:50.44]No, it's got to be messy and dirty.
[60:56.71]No.
[61:01.05]I mean, that's probably as good as it's going to get.
[61:10.60]Yeah, that's good.
[61:14.98]We got to get him to talk.
[61:21.29]Let's see, how do I get you to talk?
[61:22.33]How am I dressed like a Jedi?
[61:30.14]Hold on, I gotta change these clothes.
[61:50.16]Add a personality trait?
[61:51.10]I will.
[61:51.34]Hold on.
[61:51.58]I gotta get this right.
[61:52.40]It was like a... It was a gray tank top.
[62:02.69]Gray tank top.
[62:03.51]That's what we're looking for.
[62:08.21]No.
[62:08.87]Wait.
[62:10.76]Ooh.
[62:12.92]Ah.
[62:13.14]There it is.
[62:14.70]Just like that.
[62:15.10]Alright, but it was... Yeah, that looks good.
[62:19.72]I don't know what- I wasn't wearing pants probably that day.
[62:21.65]No, I had to have been, right?
[62:23.83]Need a bigger forehead?
[62:25.19]I'll fix it.
[62:29.95]Alright, this needs to be gray.
[62:35.45]Good.
[62:36.95]Okay.
[62:38.71]I can get that image off the screen.
[62:39.80]It looks horrible.
[62:47.67]I need a bigger forehead.
[62:50.45]That's accurate.
[62:51.27]I think that's accurate.
[62:58.83]How much bigger?
[62:59.54]Like right there.
[63:00.64]What was it before?
[63:01.26]I don't think I can even make the forehead bigger unless I put the whole face down.
[63:13.72]Don't do that.
[63:19.36]Fix the eyes.
[63:22.77]Don't touch it.
[63:25.95]I can't wait for the first close-up smile we get of this character.
[63:32.51]Nose needs to be bigger?
[63:33.53]I don't think it does, man.
[63:37.35]I mean, it's... How's that?
[63:49.46]Corners, please.
[63:50.32]I can't.
[63:51.34]Alright, corners.
[63:53.98]Mouth corners rotate.
[64:03.09]Oh, that's where the weird skin flap things are coming from.
[64:06.61]Alright, yeah, right there.
[64:07.41]Okay.
[64:17.39]Alright, let's do personality.

[64:43.32]You're a... What are you?
[64:45.28]A Virgo?
[64:48.31]Oh, no.
[64:48.63]You could be a... Who cares?
[64:49.59]You could be a... Yeah, fine.
[64:50.37]Alright, we need traits.
[64:53.43]The sus guy is, like, scary, right?
[64:55.05]And he's sus.
[64:58.43]So, we've got... Hmm.
[65:02.39]Like, where's, like, liar?
[65:07.89]Perceptive?
[65:09.15]Very perceptive.
[65:11.49]Perceptive Sims make keen investigators.
[65:14.72]Their ability to investigate and stake out potential criminals is bar none.
[65:21.02]And they're also suspicious.
[65:23.24]Where's suspicious?
[65:26.74]Okay.
[65:28.32]Vegetarian.
[65:29.10]Unlucky.
[65:31.48]Supernatural fan.
[65:34.68]Shy.
[65:35.78]Schmoozer.
[65:36.34]I feel like schmoozer, right?
[65:40.52]You can talk.
[65:41.10]You can talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.
[65:42.54]Yeah.
[65:44.96]Holy shit.
[65:45.60]It opened its mouth.
[65:49.52]Hmm.
[65:49.74]Hmm.
[65:51.91]Nurturing?
[65:52.47]No.
[65:54.35]Neurotic?
[65:55.11]Neat.
[65:58.71]IT?
[66:03.51]If you're an imposter, you're a loner.
[66:05.63]It's only you and maybe one other person.
[66:07.03]How about handy?
[66:15.71]I'm looking at handy.
[66:16.89]I can fake my tasks better than anybody else.
[66:24.31]Genius?
[66:30.20]Evil?
[66:30.72]Oh, yeah.
[66:37.46]Insane?
[66:38.20]No, I don't think an imposter... No, that's not insane.
[66:43.52]Computer whiz.
[66:48.97]Okay.
[66:51.92]Eco-friendly?
[66:53.79]Computer Wiz, yeah, because they're playing, he's playing Among Us.
[66:59.35]He's really good at it.
[67:01.01]Isn't that, what do you mean?
[67:06.05]Wait, is he's just supposed to be the character, wait, he's not playing, alright, hold on.
[67:09.45]I don't, no, guys, I, the meme is of my face.
[67:14.17]I don't even know what the fuck it's talking about.
[67:17.69]I have no idea what it's even referring to.
[67:23.21]I've not played one minute of Among Us.
[67:25.29]I don't even know what it is.
[67:27.69]These are things I've heard other popular streamers say.
[67:31.52]Oh, my tasks.
[67:32.86]Okay.
[67:33.04]I'm just going to pretend I know what that is.
[67:36.06]I can fake my tasks.
[67:37.78]Oh, dude, when you were at admin, I don't know any of these things.
[67:40.16]It's fine.
[67:42.22]If it doesn't fit, it doesn't fit.
[67:43.36]How about disciplined?
[67:49.25]You don't need skill and computers to play Among Us.
[67:56.01]Insane.
[67:58.05]Why is that?
[67:58.65]Why?
[67:59.45]Insane?
[68:00.13]I thought you had to be like smart and collected and ruthless and insane.
[68:09.11]I thought the best imposters are ones that were very smart and meticulous.
[68:14.90]They're not like crazy.
[68:17.26]They kill people.
[68:19.40]Oh, shit.
[68:20.06]This is modded Sims.
[68:21.86]He actually might kill someone.
[68:25.06]Okay.
[68:27.10]Uh, you aspire to be a master of mysticism, the emperor of evil.
[68:31.28]This is actually fine.
[68:39.50]Okay, there's the sus guy.
[68:40.37]Uh, alright, let's go.
[68:45.39]I don't want to have, like, more than five to ten people, so we gotta, we gotta... Let's make a, just a crazy, an insane person.
[68:57.18]I'll make a few pets, too.
[68:58.38]Don't worry.
[68:59.66]You have to make Stewie Griffin.
[69:04.15]I can't make Stewie.
[69:05.21]Can I make Stewie Griffin?
[69:12.63]Okay.
[69:17.72]He's got Stewie hair already.
[69:21.74]What does Stewie's head look like?
[69:22.74]It's like...
[69:28.09]I'm gonna attempt this once.
[69:35.96]I don't think I can press the head down.
[69:38.72]No Family Guy.
[69:42.08]No Family Guy.
[69:42.76]Should we just skip?
[69:43.32]No Family Guy.
[69:43.64]No Family Guy.
[69:51.97]No Family Guy.
[70:02.91]No Family Guy.
[70:04.07]Okay.
[70:05.91]Run a poll.
[70:08.01]It's a Family Guy, yes or no.
[70:09.57]That's it.
[70:11.27]While you figure that out, I'm going to make somebody else.
[70:17.32]How do I... Okay, well, Stewie's here.
[70:28.66]Yeah, run a poll.
[70:29.22]We'll find out what people want.
[70:30.94]Rafia.
[70:32.42]Okay, let's, uh... Okay, let's stick with this.
[70:38.71]Okay, um... What are we making now?
[70:50.68]I'm just so inclined to drag this bar down, like, here.
[70:56.32]I'm not making Lois.
[70:57.28]Enough.
[71:03.07]Just hit random.
[71:03.49]I don't know if it's going to do anything.
[71:07.21]Oh, it doesn't do the sliders.
[71:12.93]It does not do the sliders.
[71:18.02]Make it a different... Oh, shit.
[71:19.88]Hold on.
[71:21.30]Werewolf?
[71:22.08]Fairy?
[71:22.74]Witch?
[71:23.28]Should this be a witch?
[71:27.76]I guess it's October, right?
[71:29.76]Halloween's coming up.
[71:38.39]Make Chris Pratt's Mario.
[71:42.18]So where do you guys think we're going to go?
[71:43.52]Let's talk about the Mario movie.
[71:44.92]I haven't even talked about any of the Nintendo stuff.
[71:48.00]So the Mario movie, if you didn't know, right?
[71:50.42]We've got Chris Pratt.
[71:51.78]We've got Seth Rogen.
[71:53.76]How, where on the scale of it's just the actor talking to it's a me, are we going to be on that spectrum?
[72:03.89]What do you guys think?
[72:11.18]You think we're just going to get it's just the actor talking?
[72:13.44]I don't think we're going to.
[72:16.50]You think we're going to get full-on fake just Mario and Luigi?
[72:19.94]I don't think so.
[72:27.27]He said he was going to do it?
[72:29.81]You know, when I sit here and I think of Chris Pratt doing a Mario impression, it's like I could see him doing that.
[72:39.86]I can see it happening, right?
[72:42.94]I don't know if it's gonna be any good.
[72:48.11]No Family Guy, uh-oh.
[72:54.93]Well, he is an actor.
[73:02.44]It's like an SNL joke.
[73:06.04]I mean, should I make the, is Elon Musk gonna be Wario tweet?
[73:12.18]Somebody else probably already did like 10 times.
[73:21.03]I mean, like, if I think of something funny, and I go, oh, that's like kind of humorous to me.
[73:26.89]I think of how many times somebody else may have tweeted it, and if it's over 1,000 to 2,000 times, I go, no, whatever.
[73:31.89]Whatever.
[73:36.05]The N64 tweet was funny.
[73:39.13]I mean, let's be honest.
[73:42.44]Look, okay.
[73:43.58]I haven't even started playing The Sims, and we're going to get in a small little problem that I have here.
[73:49.08]So, the N64 SEGA Genesis stuff, they're making a big deal out of this.
[73:54.79]They've done this shit like three times already.
[73:58.96]And I think it's just every new generation of gamers, they wipe out the last place you could possibly do all this and play all this stuff.
[74:06.52]Because, like, a bunch of new gamers aren't, like, they don't know that, like, you could have got this on the virtual console, like, 10 years ago.
[74:12.29]And it's, like, the new thing.
[74:16.93]You can play Super Mario 64, kids!
[74:20.63]Whoops!
[74:22.37]We fucking deleted it!
[74:25.43]And I am not convinced.
[74:28.09]I am not convinced that this is going to be a good service because look at the Super Nintendo shit.
[74:35.14]When was the last Super Nintendo update?
[74:37.08]Like three months ago?
[74:38.80]Two months ago?
[74:40.06]We get like, what do you get, claymates?
[74:42.36]Like in a quarter?
[74:43.42]Like one quarter you get like two or three games?
[74:47.97]It's just, it's not enough.
[74:52.56]Every time I see that, like, holy shit, there's something new on the NES catalog, I forget that it even exists because it takes too long.
[75:06.64]Look, they have, like, ten games that they want to come out with, and then, like, five more that they want to add later.
[75:12.02]What about after that?
[75:13.36]Are we going to get in the same scenario where they just release, like, one N64 game every three months?
[75:19.42]Like, what the hell?
[75:24.01]Not his mic.
[75:24.77]No!
[75:28.25]Audition for Waluigi right now.
[75:29.85]Alright.
[75:38.05]Everybody cheated but me, Mario.
[75:41.04]It's-a me, Waluigi.
[75:44.44]Did I get the part?
[75:58.37]I love Jerma, because I like when he does the intentional cringe.
[76:02.05]Oh, let's make a witch.
[76:07.65]Put on a fucking song.
[76:14.04]Okay.
[76:21.54]Uh, young adult's fine.
[76:23.48]We'll come up with a name after.
[76:24.68]We figure out what they want to look like.
[76:27.61]Gruntilda.
[76:28.61]Okay.
[76:28.79]How about just Grunty?
[76:34.33]I like Grunty Flush.
[76:35.20]Okay.
[76:41.60]What if Gruntilda's here?
[76:42.44]I need a picture of Gruntilda.
[76:54.21]Audition for Gruntilda?
[76:55.49]Right now?
[76:55.81]Okay, sure.
[76:56.19]That was good, and I don't care who says it wasn't.
[77:02.93]It was fucking really good.
[77:03.84]Alright, what does she look like?
[77:05.10]Uh, alright.
[77:25.01]So we're gonna have to do the slider.
[77:27.36]Alright, which, which, which?
[77:32.72]That was unironically good.
[77:42.61]Hey, thanks.
[77:45.01]Alright, I gotta get to the face.
[77:48.93]So really, does every character that I make have to have a long, thin chin?
[77:56.89]This is just like the trope of my whole channel.
[78:00.15]It's like, look at how long their chin is.
[78:01.73]Can I make a character that doesn't have a long chin?
[78:09.06]You have to make hot Gruntilda.
[78:14.14]Is that what this Google image search is showing me?
[78:18.38]Is that what I'm getting on the Google image search?
[78:21.41]I was curious.
[78:25.31]What are you talking about?
[78:38.01]Okay, uh... I... I'm going with N64, just Gruntilda from the opening cutscene.
[78:48.43]Never played it.
[78:49.32]I did play it.
[78:51.70]I played it enough to, um... I don't know, I think I got, like, 10 puzzle pieces?
[78:56.08]20 puzzle pieces?
[78:56.90]And I played it over at one of my friend's houses.
[78:58.66]Alright, here we go.
[79:04.04]Really big eyes.
[79:05.56]Like, very, very big eyes.
[79:06.68]Like, huge.
[79:07.36]Massive.
[79:10.12]And they're pretty close together, and they take up a majority of her entire face.
[79:21.51]They're huge.
[79:28.43]Not that far away.
[79:29.16]They're pretty close.
[79:33.06]And they're tilted down a little bit.
[79:41.60]I'm going to change the eye sockets.
[79:46.00]Like that.
[79:46.62]They're kind of tilted like that.
[79:50.74]There we go.
[79:53.70]Making an anime character.
[79:54.96]Alright.
[79:55.43]Then... I wonder if it would just happen.
[79:57.87]The eyelids need to be changed.
[80:00.55]These need to come down a little bit.
[80:14.30]Not that that helped at all, but whatever.
[80:16.26]Alright, looks good.
[80:18.40]I just want to make sure you can still see the eye.
[80:24.71]There we go.
[80:24.97]Are her eyes so red?
[80:25.65]I don't know.
[80:26.41]Alright, here we go.
[80:27.43]This is like a long witch nose.
[80:43.03]Okay.
[80:43.71]It's pretty close already.
[80:52.79]There's gotta be some way here, though.
[80:54.19]Mm-hmm.
[80:55.31]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[80:59.37]Maybe not that big.
[81:05.04]I'm not touching this one.
[81:08.06]Okay, so...
[81:11.43]That's way too big.
[81:13.41]That's better.
[81:14.21]Bigger?
[81:14.61]I think that's good.
[81:16.57]Her face is thinner though.
[81:41.38]Yeah, the face is too thick.
[81:43.56]The face is too thick.
[81:44.24]I gotta... Hold on.
[81:53.23]Face height?
[81:56.64]I gotta get rid of the hair.
[82:10.66]There it is.
[82:11.10]It's better.
[82:12.10]This is how just every crazy son of a bitch sees people.
[82:22.49]This is how I see people?
[82:26.03]Alright, pull these cheeks in.
[82:30.18]That's a little better.
[82:43.94]Better.
[82:47.58]Better.
[82:47.86]We're getting close.
[82:55.08]This is Mosquito?
[82:55.92]No, this is Gruntilda.
[83:00.34]I think the face is even longer.
[83:01.64]I think I have to go real kind of crazy with this.
[83:07.03]It's, it's a flat.
[83:08.65]It's long.
[83:22.54]This is just like fucking pizza cheese dripping out of her chin.
[83:26.72]Okay.
[83:45.96]Okay, that looks good.
[83:46.98]Now I gotta get a witch's hat.
[83:49.92]The eye's fine, the nose is fine.
[83:53.80]The mouth... Hold on.
[83:55.54]The mouth, though.
[83:56.20]Wait.
[83:58.00]It has a mouth.
[83:58.84]Is there, like, a front picture of Antilda?
[84:01.49]Alright.
[84:03.89]It's a little... It's kind of... It's got a big, wide mouth.
[84:09.59]How deep is that mouth?
[84:10.39]Like... Kind of like that.
[84:22.68]definition looks good yep looks that looks good alright the width height and width right underneath her nose in a way like right here
[84:47.23]Is this the whole game?
[84:49.67]I would say this is probably arguably one of the more important... I mean, I'm going to be streaming for a long time.
[84:53.73]This is not going to be like a three-hour, four-hour stream.
[84:55.43]We're going pretty much all day.
[84:56.39]I need green skin.
[85:02.53]I know.
[85:02.75]Hold on.
[85:03.59]I got to get this right first.
[85:06.40]I don't like how happy that mouth is.
[85:07.70]You understand?
[85:20.11]The mouth is too happy.
[85:22.53]There we go.
[85:26.35]Alright.
[85:29.11]Uh... Green.
[85:38.64]Run Tilda.
[85:40.92]Already wearing purple.
[85:49.39]Is she bald?
[85:50.70]No, she's got long hair.
[85:52.06]Under the hat, though.
[85:52.74]Is there a witch's hat?
[85:56.96]Of course there is.
[86:01.60]Cat?
[86:09.21]I don't... Which one?
[86:13.37]There's some hair under there, isn't there?
[86:23.77]This is a Karen witch.
[86:25.91]Alright, now we just need, we need like a cake.
[86:35.85]Clothing, let's go with, uh, yeah, I want outfits.
[86:41.27]Alright, can I make this, this is black and purple?
[86:46.23]Okay, wait, wait, wait, remember that one.
[87:03.48]The top is fine.
[87:04.22]Alright.
[87:05.28]Hold on.
[87:09.00]Shit.
[87:09.38]No, I need the other parts.
[87:10.18]And it's white on the bottom.
[87:17.94]I think this is perfect.
[87:22.28]I don't think we're going to get much better than that.
[87:23.80]Honestly, God.
[87:30.28]Shorter legs?
[87:30.98]I don't think you can do height.
[87:35.74]Yeah, height is not an option.
[87:39.51]I just have witch's shoes, though.
[87:41.29]Alright, witch shoes.
[87:52.74]They have witch shoes.
[87:54.32]Well, we can just do these.
[87:59.61]I like boots, actually.
[88:00.67]Hold on.
[88:14.70]I think these are fine.
[88:22.55]These are fine.
[88:23.17]These are too black.
[88:27.85]I guess they already were.
[88:32.17]Oh shit, wait, no.
[88:32.85]Let's do different couples.
[88:39.27]Alright, uh, I believe now we have to do personality.
[88:43.59]Alright, traits.
[88:54.64]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[88:56.00]Alright, she's evil.
[89:01.43]I don't know much about her.
[89:05.37]Piledish?
[89:06.53]Probably.
[89:12.06]Coward?
[89:15.14]She's evil and she rhymes.
[89:16.54]Okay, alright.
[89:21.48]Eccentric?
[89:24.04]Evil?
[89:24.30]I would say...
[89:32.30]Yes, sir.
[89:34.74]Grumpy.
[89:35.22]She's Gruntilda, obviously.
[89:36.60]Hmm.
[89:44.26]Okay.
[89:44.52]How about Loser?
[89:50.73]Mean Spirit.
[89:52.83]Probably Neurotic, right?
[89:58.91]Hates Children.
[90:03.90]Supernatural fan?
[90:06.10]I mean, come on.
[90:16.64]Green thumb?
[90:19.12]I'll take away eccentric.
[90:23.14]We'll do... What should I replace it with?
[90:25.92]Rooting?
[90:31.36]Insane works.
[90:33.67]Everybody in the house is going to be insane.
[90:36.25]Green thumb.
[90:38.07]Because she's a witch?
[90:40.13]She's green?
[90:41.59]Why do you want me to do that?
[90:42.31]Family oriented.
[90:54.49]She eats children.
[90:55.61]Okay, yeah.
[90:57.83]Dislikes children.
[90:58.57]That's a good one.
[90:58.99]Does she eat kids?
[91:00.82]What are you talking about?
[91:11.99]Munga S, yeah.
[91:12.91]I don't remember that.
[91:17.52]Alright, we gotta go back.
[91:18.42]I gotta remove this.
[91:22.14]Stuart Flush has gotta go.
[91:26.00]Unless I change this into something else.
[91:30.14]How do I delete this person?
[91:35.28]Alright, hold on.
[91:36.86]I want to make a dog.
[91:39.80]Or a horse.
[91:44.55]Make Young Sheldon.
[91:50.53]Oh, please let me do this.
[91:52.13]Come on.
[91:53.25]Alright.
[91:56.20]Elder pet?
[92:00.50]Make the horse look human.
[92:01.60]That's what I'm going to try to do.
[92:02.64]I'm going to try to make it a person's face.
[92:06.54]Alright, the Oreo cookie one.
[92:09.20]Shape?
[92:09.60]Oh my god, please.
[92:15.26]Wait, are there no sliders?
[92:19.29]There are no sliders, I don't think.
[92:23.29]Body?
[92:25.17]Oh, come on.
[92:26.13]Really?
[92:26.43]Advanced mode, please.
[92:29.11]Oh god.
[92:36.07]That's it?
[92:43.15]What?
[92:50.67]Do I have to change this in the... in the setting somewhere to make it so animals can do it too?
[93:04.26]Thank God for no sliders.
[93:05.45]Click the head.
[93:09.97]Damn it.
[93:15.99]Oh, it only does it... It only does it for people, not animals.
[93:22.75]Make a pet out of a person.
[93:28.22]I think I can... Somebody said I can pause and edit them in the game and change them.
[93:32.26]We'll try that.
[93:32.74]Alright, well, let me get this right.
[93:38.72]That just scared me.
[93:40.38]I forgot this person existed.
[93:41.58]Okay.
[93:43.34]Let's go with the horse's name here.
[93:47.90]Let's back it up.
[93:48.56]How do I get it back?
[93:52.31]We'll just make the horse face region.
[93:55.39]Ears scale.
[93:58.19]Okay.
[93:59.59]Alright.
[94:00.53]Whatever.
[94:04.03]We'll come back in later and see if I can fix it.
[94:09.97]I'm gonna get out of here.
[94:13.60]Oh, basic.
[94:14.18]Alright, well, what's the horse's name?
[94:27.02]Oreo cookie.
[94:28.88]I like Oreo.
[94:36.98]Oh, wait, I can do personality.
[94:37.94]Hold on.
[94:41.89]Alright, I have to make one just absolute mutant person.
[94:47.78]Sure.
[94:50.58]I am not gonna hold back at all.
[94:53.64]This is gonna be insane.
[94:55.26]I'm gonna try to make this person the most fucked up I possibly can.
[95:29.03]Mr. Green?
[95:29.89]No, it's not Mr. Green.
[95:33.76]Oh!
[95:36.88]Make sure he's got a big chin.
[95:46.71]Oh!
[95:52.21]At this point, this just doesn't even matter.
[95:59.65]How about all the way down?
[96:00.43]What's the cheekbones?
[96:03.81]Ugh.
[96:03.89]That's disgusting.
[96:05.19]Looks like the mouth.
[96:08.23]I can't say it.
[96:09.21]What the fuck?
[96:10.09]I can't.
[96:32.48]change this.
[96:37.60]I feel like his head just went through with a hydraulic press video.
[96:42.57]What the fuck?
[96:51.43]No.
[96:54.08]Alright.
[96:57.44]I like that.
[96:57.90]That's fine.
[97:04.08]Oh, it's not sewn.
[97:06.54]It's wrong.
[97:11.58]It's just wrong.
[97:12.66]I made their face inside out.
[97:29.17]Keep it.
[97:43.88]Where'd the eyes go?
[97:45.04]Shit, hold on.
[97:54.63]Holy shit.
[97:59.04]Uh, I believe this character is from Hellraiser.
[98:22.85]Make his eyes upside down.
[98:26.63]No, I want to be able to actually even look at this.
[98:28.95]I'll fix it.
[98:29.57]This is too much.
[98:30.19]I don't like this.
[98:30.79]This is scaring me.
[98:31.63]It's scary.
[98:32.98]This is really scary.
[98:33.90]I don't like it.
[98:34.82]I don't... It's Ben 10.
[98:37.76]Oh, fuck.
[98:47.31]Ugh.
[98:51.62]What's the character from Ben 10?
[98:53.40]What's the Ben 10 name of that monster?
[98:55.70]I know who you're talking about.
[98:58.18]Ah, real monsters?
[98:59.02]It's the guy with the armpits, right?
[99:06.20]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[99:07.82]Let's not get too over our head here.
[99:12.36]Oh my god.
[99:13.22]We're gonna get jump scared randomly.
[99:28.57]Brow rotation.
[99:29.33]I don't even know what the nose is.
[99:35.93]Where is the nose?
[99:42.14]Not too wild.
[99:42.80]I want to be able to see the face.
[99:44.52]You know what I mean?
[99:57.17]The mouse.
[100:05.83]It's a rat of some kind.
[100:25.65]It's a giant rat.
[100:27.37]Let's work with it.
[100:29.91]I'm working with it.
[100:38.87]Okay, nose width.
[100:41.01]No.
[100:42.17]Tight.
[100:42.75]Not that tight.
[100:43.23]Okay.
[100:44.25]A little bit wider.
[100:46.15]Better.
[100:47.89]Mouth can be fixed.
[100:48.71]Alright, let's figure this out.
[101:02.56]You can cover that up.
[101:03.98]That looks better like that.
[101:04.98]I can bring it forward.
[101:15.40]That's the tongue.
[101:21.03]Where's the tongue?
[101:21.73]How do I make the tongue smaller?
[101:22.93]It's just venom.
[101:24.39]It kind of is venom.
[101:46.37]Whatever.
[101:51.29]Oh, ears.
[101:51.63]Whoa.

[102:37.23]What will I do?
[102:39.12]Choices, they're true.
[102:40.92]I'm not sure, but I want some time to maybe think about.
[102:44.78]Maybe I'll have some food.
[102:46.68]Maybe I'll build a house.
[102:48.72]I don't care.
[102:49.69]It is time to begin The Sims.
[102:55.29]Go back a little bit further.
[102:56.77]Like that.
[102:57.13]Alright, that's fine.
[102:59.07]I'm done.

[103:34.15]Where's fur?
[103:35.39]It needs to be a werewolf?
[103:36.77]Will that screw everything up?
[104:02.52]Looks like a hammerhead shark.
[104:07.32]Alright, I'm done after this.
[104:08.32]We're gonna play after this.
[104:10.84]Looks like an elephant.

[136:04.89]Is it a barn door?
[136:11.42]What about... Will it be able to go through the garage door?
[136:13.80]Does that work?
[136:23.20]There are no lights?
[136:23.90]I'll take care of that.

[137:07.42]There you go.
[137:12.16]Okay.
[137:16.04]This is, I would say, should be wood or stone?
[137:19.38]Masonry?
[137:20.57]What do horses like to walk on?
[137:29.63]Grass?
[137:32.67]Well, it's part of the house though.
[137:35.53]Dirt?
[137:41.59]Gold?
[137:46.21]It's not gonna be grass.
[137:48.48]Straw?

[139:55.07]Put the hay in the living room.
[140:00.21]Okay.
[140:01.33]Uh, should we give him a TV and stuff too?
[140:29.47]Can you see?
[140:29.79]That's going to be on the wall.
[140:40.50]It's the only flat screen.
[140:42.72]$8,000.
[140:42.74]What the hell?
[140:43.18]I don't want to buy that.

[141:38.00]Now I just need a couch and I'm ready to go.
[141:39.78]Sleeping bags.
[141:48.09]Oh, dude, sleeping bags.
[141:58.78]Alright, now let's try to beat Star Fox 64.

[142:29.44]We're very close.
[142:35.44]Okay, I told you I was going to just not use the money for anything stupid.
[142:46.65]Alright, I need couches.
[142:47.53]Is there a chair or a couch?
[143:00.37]I don't know.

[143:14.92]Is this facing the right way?
[143:21.14]Which way is the right way?
[143:26.36]Oh, you need a table and chairs to eat.
[143:27.78]That's right.
[143:35.32]This has to be a huge table.
[143:37.42]Oh, what?
[143:42.24]That's like a hot dog.
[143:44.70]Chairs.
[143:47.11]I need dining room chairs.
[144:08.63]Okay.
[144:09.09]Why is the room so big?
[144:09.91]I don't know.
[144:10.27]I always accidentally... I'm sorry.
[144:12.71]I make the first room in The Sims always gigantic.
[144:16.42]I don't know why.
[144:19.64]It's a weird habit where I just make a huge cube first.
[144:30.11]Are those kids chairs?
[144:31.09]These look like plastic kids chairs.
[144:33.13]Are they?
[144:33.41]Here we go.
[144:37.63]Save the game.
[144:46.40]Time to begin.

[145:47.92]You know, what did you... Hold on.
[145:50.00]Why did you just do all that?
[145:51.36]Does a horse eat that?
[145:54.35]Getting warm.
[146:03.32]Okay.

[148:14.65]Emergency meeting.
[148:24.97]Okay, I don't want to- I don't want to collect any power cells.
[148:30.11]That was a weird- that windmill windup was stupid.

[148:52.53]You know what I mean?
[148:53.11]I don't know what that means.
[148:54.56]I don't think I want to do that.

[223:43.23]Okay, well... Go to the bathroom.
[223:45.29]Eat whatever this is.
[223:55.30]Oh, don't clean it up, you idiot.
[223:58.64]Grab a plate.
[224:00.44]I gotta get rid of these stupid sleeping bags.
[224:05.47]Go take a shower.
[224:06.39]I can only care about one of these people, and it's the rat werewolf guy.
[224:09.31]What?
[224:26.29]Somebody that's in a good mood... I don't know why they won't... Okay, it's not raining anymore, so... Care?
[224:31.89]Rush.
[224:39.03]I thought that was a beaver.
[224:50.01]Please.
[224:53.19]Somebody brush this animal.
[224:57.39]Brush.
[225:02.87]Holy shit, it took you forever to figure that out.
[225:06.42]Alright, now it's time for you to go out.
[225:14.90]I want to go do something.
[225:15.74]I don't want to just sit here and chase around a horse.
[225:19.68]Sunset Institution of Modern Art.
[225:22.72]The beach.
[225:23.88]Yes.
[225:25.48]Is it Old Pier Beach with
[225:30.22]Let's all go.
[225:30.94]Why not?
[225:40.18]The sleeping bag causes aching back.
[225:43.82]How does the horse get there?
[225:47.52]The cat doesn't get a taxi, right?
[225:56.83]So many people can't fit in here.
[226:01.29]What about the horse?
[226:02.55]You can't just leave the horse.
[226:12.36]I guess this is exercise.
[226:14.04]Okay.
[226:25.14]We'll be waiting for you.
[226:26.14]Who else is at the beach today?
[226:29.71]Anybody?
[226:30.03]How many friends?
[226:36.96]Should I call somebody else to come hang out here?
[226:40.74]Is nobody here?
[226:41.32]Are we all going in?
[227:07.85]What?
[227:08.69]Swimming into a riptide?
[227:10.36]I don't think that's what's happening.
[227:27.51]What's wrong with you?
[227:28.05]What are you doing?
[227:30.03]What?
[227:31.19]You can stand on the ground.
[227:33.11]Can I help him?
[227:34.43]What do you mean he's stuck?
[227:36.88]Swimming.
[227:38.88]Is he stuck?
[227:43.05]No, he's alright.
[227:43.53]That was weird.
[227:49.82]I lost weight?
[227:50.52]Alright, you're going out a little far.
[228:03.73]Wait, did he lose a shitload of weight?
[228:05.69]Look at his stomach.
[228:08.19]Oh my God, he's actually thinner.
[228:09.51]Where's the cat?
[228:21.34]He's going to drown.
[228:22.62]He's not going to drown.
[228:23.58]He's fine.
[228:27.94]Ah, beach day.
[228:35.01]Can you play in the water?
[228:37.03]Oh, splash.
[228:47.59]Wait, am I gonna throw a rock at him?
[229:05.47]What is wrong with me?
[229:19.33]A party right here.
[229:30.57]Act- Oh my goodness.
[229:35.05]Lost a bunch of weight.
[229:35.93]It was him.
[229:36.35]Don't go too far out.
[229:41.85]Come on.
[229:44.22]Why is it so sad?
[229:45.08]I don't think this is sad.
[229:47.10]What are you talking about?
[229:52.06]Um.

[232:03.39]I just thigh crushed his head.
[232:08.61]Oh, he's gone.
[232:09.87]Damn it.
[232:13.01]What?
[232:14.37]What the fuck?
[232:17.22]Why did he do that?
[232:24.18]I need to see that again.
[232:32.28]It's so stupid!
[232:34.83]Damn it!
[232:37.67]Alright, let's have a quick drink.
[232:57.72]Why do you keep doing that?
[233:02.36]Who's this?
[233:03.89]Alright, is it safe to drop a meteor in the ocean?
[233:23.72]What else can I do?
[233:24.38]Hold on.
[233:30.45]Hit somebody in the water with lightning.
[233:32.39]I don't remember doing that.
[233:39.09]Burn lightning strike.
[233:41.74]Make ugly.
[233:44.36]Splash.

[234:05.92]React to meteor.
[234:13.82]Wait, the kid's looking up at the sky.
[234:19.20]No, hold on.

[235:03.72]Okay.
[235:04.04]Well, I thought I saved it.
[235:06.24]I don't think I did.
[235:10.87]I activated the meteor when he was in the water.
[235:13.71]He was a soul guy over here, just by himself.
[235:18.21]I was thinking I could just drop it and see what happens in the water.
[235:24.66]Wait, how did he get fatter?
[235:31.78]What?
[235:32.88]Why is he fat again?
[235:43.20]Okay, everybody that's like burnt.

[235:48.37]I gotta get out of here.
[235:49.25]I gotta get out of here.
[235:49.87]I gotta get out of here.
[235:50.41]I gotta get out of here.
[235:55.77]She's smoldering.
[235:59.07]Where's the horse?
[236:04.83]I don't know.
[236:19.09]He's puking!
[236:20.23]He's puking!
[236:21.47]Wait, why is he puking?
[236:24.15]Why is the horse puking?
[236:26.35]What happened?
[236:26.93]Is he alright?
[236:37.36]It was just a puke just coming out of his mouth.
[236:41.38]Who's even in this house?
[236:43.32]What?
[236:45.94]Ah.
[236:48.36]Um.
[236:49.73]Okay.
[236:53.83]Who's this?

[237:08.43]Fff.
[237:31.33]Where is he?
[237:34.18]What happened?
[237:36.24]Where did that zombie go?
[237:58.25]Is it an illusion?
[237:59.03]Hey!
[238:09.38]Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!
[238:10.24]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[238:11.22]This is the stupidest thing ever.
[238:18.49]I hate this.
[238:20.61]I hate this.
[238:23.07]Give permission to ride horse?
[238:24.85]Alright, this thing has to die, right?
[238:29.19]Zombie.
[238:29.39]Still alive.
[238:29.73]Earn it.
[238:57.86]What is that sound?
[238:58.94]How would a zombie have a ghost?
[239:34.26]Why is he... Okay.
[239:36.12]You just keep fainting.
[239:37.48]Is that... Is he pretending?
[239:38.86]Faint.
[239:40.80]Okay.
[239:47.30]Well, that was weird.
[239:47.86]I was going to say he ran all the way back here across... Wait.
[239:51.09]Where's the cat?
[240:00.85]You have fleas.
[240:12.90]Um, hold on.
[240:14.16]Where's the other people in this?
[240:20.97]Why'd they leave the cat?
[240:34.54]Go home.
[240:40.61]Go on.
[240:44.97]Wait, who's this?
[240:56.14]Oh, somebody lives here.
[240:56.92]Okay.
[240:58.82]Alright, go back home.
[241:00.28]Go on.
[241:04.34]We need to get this cat a bath.
[241:16.27]I think something's wrong with the horse.
[241:21.10]Wake up.
[241:21.40]We need to feed you and play with stuff.
[241:25.66]Drink some water.
[241:26.34]Have some hay.
[241:27.62]Eat some hay.
[241:32.43]And then...
[241:34.48]Play with the ball.
[241:40.10]That's good.
[241:40.64]There we go.
[241:45.81]Does the horse have a TV?
[241:49.63]There's a TV in the horse room, yeah.
[241:52.17]Okay.
[241:55.51]Have some food and then... Play with the... And then you're gonna have to pee.
[241:58.39]Where does a horse pee?
[242:02.01]Just outside?
[242:12.10]If you have a horse in a stable, does it just pee in the stable?
[242:14.82]How does that work?
[242:21.76]It just pees, like, wherever it wants?
[242:23.16]Yeah.
[242:25.40]If the horse uses a urinal.
[242:29.54]Oh, it's the cat.
[242:30.48]Alright, you're back.
[242:34.92]Some dinner.
[242:37.56]And then, get some sleep.
[242:51.59]I still don't understand.
[242:52.55]I'm deleting these.
[242:53.17]This is the only person in the house that's not sleeping on the ground.
[243:00.61]There are three full beds here.
[243:02.07]Why are we all sleeping on the ground?
[243:05.85]Alright, yeah, yeah.
[243:06.43]We'll do a pee break.
[243:06.95]I'll be right back.
[243:08.81]I'm gonna go pee.
[243:09.94]See you guys in like two minutes.
[247:13.77]Okay.
[247:14.87]I just want to get some water.
[247:15.63]I have hair all over my hand.
[247:20.94]I think it's Otto.
[247:25.14]Otto's hair.
[247:25.74]Alright.
[247:39.43]Delicious.
[247:43.97]Let's go.
[247:44.37]I paused the game for a second.
[247:51.10]What was the last thing at the beach?
[247:52.86]I need to start going places besides just dropping meteors on people when they're in the beach.
[247:57.78]You know what I mean?
[248:04.15]I've killed like six people.
[248:05.53]We laugh out loud killed six people.
[248:07.45]I don't need more.
[248:13.99]The colors are wrong.
[248:16.57]I'm just picking up on this right now.
[248:18.87]Why are the colors wrong?
[248:21.47]Why is it purple?
[248:25.89]This is supposed to be blue.
[248:33.69]What is going on with the colors?
[248:39.97]Why is this purple?
[248:45.44]It's blue in my game.
[248:46.57]Why is it purple over here?
[248:49.91]What?
[248:50.11]That shouldn't look like that.
[249:03.47]Pirated copy?
[249:06.70]On my main monitor, this is all blue.
[249:09.86]Like blue, blue.
[249:10.58]Bright blue.
[249:13.04]This down here is not purple.
[249:19.23]Why is this happening?
[249:31.46]It looks a little better, but still weird.
[249:40.97]Why is it doing this?
[249:50.37]it's an Instagram filter I feel like I'm losing my mind looking over here at this yeah why I don't I don't know why it's capturing it like this who cares I mean I don't really necessarily care but that's just very weird
[250:19.47]It has like a purple tint on it.
[250:29.53]Like even the road has like a purple tint.
[250:34.04]What about morning time?
[250:34.84]What does it look like for you guys in the morning?
[250:43.58]It looks better this way?
[250:47.47]Because it's night?
[250:48.19]Well, but mine is blue for me, not purple.
[250:59.18]Oh, somebody broke the sink!
[251:01.70]Fix it.
[251:20.17]Okay, so we're back.
[251:20.93]So for me... Yeah, you just change back to blue.
[251:28.18]It's not perp... It was... That's weird.
[251:30.22]That's very strange.
[251:30.94]Alright.
[251:35.36]I want to take everybody today.
[251:36.64]We're gonna go... Over here.
[251:38.98]I want to do something interesting.
[251:43.00]Whose house is this?
[251:46.04]What about like... Community Fire Department?
[251:50.85]Wait, Central Park Summer Festival?
[251:54.76]Why can't I?
[251:55.20]Oh, is it 8 a.m.?
[251:56.58]What time is it?
[251:58.52]Well, just, let's go.
[251:59.40]Hurry up.
[252:08.93]Alright.
[252:12.99]Let's bring everybody.
[252:13.79]Go to the festival.
[252:20.12]Here comes a filler episode.
[252:25.02]What can you do at the festival?
[252:26.16]It sounds like it's gonna be fun.
[252:30.84]It's like a pie eating contest?
[252:32.04]Oh, eating contest.
[252:35.96]Who is- I don't even know who this person is.
[252:37.14]No, don't go home!
[252:50.87]Alright, let's go.
[252:51.51]Load up the car, kids.
[252:59.97]I was just gonna drop a meteor on that person's house, but we did that joke three times.
[253:03.80]No more.
[253:04.04]Can the horse join the eating contest?
[253:12.44]We're gonna find out.
[253:16.47]Wait, you can play soccer?
[253:22.73]How come you're not going?
[253:27.41]Why are you not going?
[253:29.79]Don't watch TV.
[253:30.51]Go join the festival.
[253:36.37]I'm sorry.
[253:36.87]I'm not going to roundhouse kick the paperboy.
[253:39.70]I'm sorry.
[253:42.92]I know a lot of people are sitting there going, oh my god, he's going to roundhouse kick the person that delivers the mail.
[253:52.35]Like, oh, whoops, I accidentally clicked it.
[253:54.95]I'm not gonna, no, I'm not gonna do any of that.
[253:57.09]We're gonna go to the festival and we're gonna have a good time.
[254:06.66]Oh, Grunty's doing the contest.
[254:11.10]It's Grunty versus, um... Who is this?
[254:19.26]Oh!
[254:24.50]Why join the contest if you're going to do that?
[254:28.77]Why are you even in the contest?
[254:30.41]Why are you here?
[254:35.45]One, two, three, go?
[254:36.25]When do they go?
[254:37.89]What are we waiting for?
[254:50.60]Oh, wait, another contestant.
[254:51.66]Okay.
[254:56.00]Go!
[255:01.91]Three, two, one, go!
[255:04.43]He's gonna piss his pants.
[255:21.28]Oh.
[255:34.21]oh no no why wait did we not complete it who the is this guy he's got like a criminal
[256:08.21]Three, two, one, go!
[256:11.59]And they're off eating their hot dogs.
[256:14.67]Burglar, Elephant Man, and Ratchet from Ratchet and Clank, and Gruntilda.
[256:19.87]Burglar gets off to a quick start, gets three or four hot dogs down already.
[256:23.67]He's going really fast, potentially even too fast.
[256:27.97]Unfortunately, it looks like he's getting a little too many hot dogs down his throat.
[256:32.63]He seems to start choking.
[256:34.81]Hopefully he's gonna be okay.
[256:37.96]No, he's fine.
[256:39.04]He's completely fine.
[256:40.96]He just had to get it down with a little bit of water.
[256:43.64]He's absolutely fine.
[256:46.64]It looks like... I think he's going to be okay.
[256:57.21]Wait, why is he back to life?
[256:58.49]He's still eating the hot dog.
[257:01.25]Even after death, the burglar doesn't care.
[257:03.27]Still wants to win this competition.
[257:05.22]He trained for months, it seems.
[257:07.78]Potentially years.
[257:10.82]Even after pissing his pants, shitting his pants, breaking his own neck and choking, he's still going to be doing this.
[257:15.08]He's still here.
[257:15.54]And we're going to claim them the winner.
[257:19.16]Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the hot dog eating contest is the burglar.
[257:24.03]I'm going to stop this from happening.
[257:31.27]Stop it.
[257:34.45]Oh, baby, walk.
[257:41.28]Oh, he's fine.
[257:41.72]But he's getting... Oh, alright.
[257:43.70]You're fine.
[257:47.20]What else can we do?
[257:48.86]Did everybody leave because they freaked out because he was puking and stuff?
[257:58.72]What the fuck is going on here?
[258:01.10]What is happening?
[258:03.38]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[258:06.34]Hold on, let me get it.
[258:07.46]Hold on, let me get it.
[258:12.49]Hold on, where is it?
[258:18.11]Can I even do it?
[258:18.67]I'm not going to be able to do this, right?
[258:25.03]Where's he going?
[258:42.93]Get away from me.
[258:43.43]Get away from me.
[258:43.79]Get away from me.
[258:44.17]Get away from me.
[258:44.55]Get away from me.
[258:44.97]Get away from me.
[258:45.81]Get away from me.
[258:47.52]Get away from me.
[258:48.32]I kind of want to hang out with this person.
[258:59.78]Here.
[259:00.58]Let's talk.
[259:01.46]That's a... Okay, it's a fairy.
[259:04.10]Another werewolf.
[259:14.69]What did you do?
[259:17.65]Oh, let's play with the sprinkler.
[259:18.71]Let's go.
[259:19.23]All of us.
[259:19.53]Is there a soccer match going on?
[259:25.32]Why are you not playing together?
[259:31.32]This is sad.
[259:35.48]Are you serious?
[259:46.94]Just turn around.
[259:48.30]Dog.
[259:52.82]Go brush the dog.
[260:06.37]That's really awkward.
[260:07.37]Alright, he's getting naked.
[260:10.97]This is weird.
[260:14.51]Why are they putting them... You have all your clothes on.
[260:18.24]What's wrong with you guys?
[260:23.96]What is the burn lady?
[260:27.32]What the fuck is going on?
[260:29.46]Wait, what is ice blast?
[260:44.52]Ice blast!
[260:47.34]I don't think he does anything
[261:18.95]I guess I'm about to do it.
[261:20.33]Okay, I missed.
[261:21.49]Can we turn off the sprinkler, please?
[261:24.55]Like, enough with the sprinkler.
[261:48.99]Casted an unknown spell.
[261:54.75]What about this other stuff over here?
[261:55.67]What's this?
[261:56.11]What's this sus guy doing?
[262:11.94]Let's just do it.
[262:12.72]Everybody.
[262:13.68]I'm training.
[262:14.58]Sasuke.
[262:16.90]Why do I feel like this would be a real thing?
[262:19.34]Some fucking video game convention.
[262:23.64]Hot dog eating contest with the Sasuke.
[262:27.38]And like eight people sign up and we pretend like there was a shitload of people that were in line to do this.
[262:36.44]And in the audience is like the people that I paid to film it.
[262:40.80]There's like probably six or seven people there, like a production crew.
[262:43.84]And maybe four other people in the audience.
[262:54.31]And then it eventually gets uploaded to YouTube as part of like a panel or something.
[262:57.57]It's the least viewed out of all of them, out of everything from the convention.
[263:08.12]How do I guarantee victory?
[263:09.38]Where even- Should I shit my own pants?
[263:15.62]Oh, she won!
[263:18.49]Gruntilda wins!
[263:36.13]Why are we still doing this?
[263:37.67]Did she just snap her neck?
[263:40.07]She just broke her own neck.
[263:42.93]What was that?
[263:47.33]Let's go make a snow cone.
[263:53.62]I don't know.
[264:12.92]Um, uh, what?
[264:16.28]Oh, he turned into a werewolf.
[264:19.20]I get it.
[264:23.65]You alright?
[264:25.95]Fainted.
[264:31.99]Okay, well.
[264:37.66]That was funny, I guess.
[264:44.60]Oh, shit.
[264:45.24]We've got something going on over here, don't we?
[264:47.22]We've got something going on here, don't we?
[264:49.02]Hmm.
[264:49.34]Alright.
[264:49.70]Come on.
[264:50.12]Let's...
[265:14.03]Made it five feet.
[265:14.91]No, no, no, no.
[265:22.31]What did I just do?
[265:22.97]What did I just do?
[265:23.57]I didn't save it.
[265:24.05]What did I just do?
[265:26.10]What happened?
[265:26.58]No, no, no.
[265:28.34]Stop, stop, stop.
[265:28.90]Don't do anything.
[265:29.30]Don't do anything stupid.
[265:29.96]What did I just do?
[265:31.48]He's fine.
[265:33.58]He's fine.
[265:33.98]Okay.
[265:34.58]He didn't do anything weird.
[265:35.82]I just scared the shit out of him.
[265:41.74]I thought I had him break his neck or something.
[265:50.45]What's your name?
[265:51.55]Edge.
[265:51.97]Uh-oh!
[265:59.86]Sky I swear to God Hi
[266:29.38]Oh, is there just a horse?
[266:34.14]Excuse me?
[266:35.73]Whose horse is this?
[266:41.31]Okay.
[266:47.69]What is he doing?
[266:48.51]Oh, he's reacting to noisy public stereo.
[266:51.39]He doesn't like the stereo.
[266:52.55]Turn it off.
[266:53.65]I think we're... Where's Oreo?
[266:54.95]Where's Oreo?
[266:55.61]Oreo's fine.
[266:56.17]He's hanging out.
[266:56.99]Where's the cat?
[266:58.57]Cat is...

[270:31.97]Who is this person?
[270:39.26]Oh, Lisa.

[270:56.42]Answer the phone!
[270:57.56]Where's the answer phone?
[270:58.90]Is it a witch?
[271:09.95]I didn't even- I didn't even select that.
[271:18.27]He didn't- they're such weirdos.
[271:21.70]Hey, get your shit together.
[271:52.30]He keeps going into the bathroom.
[271:57.78]He's back in the bathroom again.
[272:06.07]Oh no, this isn't the bathroom.
[272:06.89]He's getting his face painted.
[272:21.01]I thought this was like a bathroom.
[272:22.63]Alright, he needs to go to sleep.
[272:26.61]Just go home.
[272:32.13]Go get out of here.
[272:35.31]You made that guy just to bully him?
[272:36.85]No, I did not.
[272:55.47]I smell.
[272:56.19]I smell bad.
[273:01.25]Is this Zelda?
[273:04.26]Who else is still here?
[273:06.60]Man, you really, really like it in the roller skating rink.
[273:12.30]Been here all day.
[273:18.97]I'm not going to drop a meteor.
[273:21.19]I don't want to, though.
[273:26.33]I don't want to summon a meteor, but I... No, no.
[273:33.12]I want to be friends with this person.
[273:36.44]Because the party just never ends with this guy.
[273:42.06]No, I can't sleep because then the night will be over and I'm having too much fun.
[273:46.71]Right?
[273:47.57]I get it.
[273:48.69]But you gotta go.
[273:57.87]Easy on the syrup there.

[274:21.72]This is... I don't know.
[274:23.06]That's gross.
[274:30.86]It looks like a cow or something.
[274:35.36]He dropped it.
[274:42.92]Are you going to pick it up off the ground?
[274:50.09]Oh, I wish he picked it up off the ground.
[274:51.33]I'm going to go get another one.
[275:04.57]Same flavor?
[275:04.95]What do you think?

[278:30.30]Where's the horse?
[278:36.38]This guy has been in here watching TV in the horse place.
[278:40.32]He didn't go to the event.
[278:41.34]He's been in here the whole time.

[279:49.93]You just ate one.
[279:51.65]Wait, did I say eat it?
[279:55.07]Why did you just eat a raw onion?
[279:56.21]Did I tell him to do that?
[279:59.95]Aww.
[280:14.61]Have you ever eaten an onion on the ground?
[280:16.57]Alright, let's go.

[281:38.06]Give horse free rein.
[281:39.72]Why are you calling over the cat?
[281:46.18]Why is he calling the cat over?
[281:47.84]Why is he calling the cat over?
[281:49.40]What?
[281:50.52]Why?
[282:04.86]This guy smells.
[282:10.27]Always.
[282:10.75]Give him free rain?
[282:17.81]Let him go free?
[282:20.79]Alright.
[282:23.24]We're gonna give Oreo free rain.
[282:30.70]You love him, you must let him go.
[282:34.58]Let's take him somewhere.
[282:35.56]Let's get him somewhere.
[282:36.22]Let's get him out of here.
[282:37.24]Or should I release him?
[282:49.19]We're like up here.
[282:49.75]Let's go release him in somebody else's backyard.
[283:03.05]Take him to the farm?
[283:04.61]Is there a farm?
[283:08.19]Get plastic surgery.
[283:25.76]Let's go.
[283:39.35]No, I wanted to ride into the... I wanted to ride over here.
[283:47.17]No, don't just run in somebody's house.
[283:50.40]Just wait.
[283:52.22]I wanted to show up at the front door with a horse.
[284:00.04]Okay, there we go.
[284:30.21]That didn't work.
[284:34.61]You're not going to ride over there.
[284:35.83]Oh, there we go.
[284:39.65]Okay, let us in.
[284:40.19]Hey.
[284:42.94]Hey.
[284:47.71]Can I?
[284:49.65]You're gone.
[284:49.99]Alright.
[284:56.19]What's going on?
[285:02.24]Who is this guy?
[285:03.08]Does this person live here?
[285:20.71]You're just being a nuisance.
[285:21.67]I'm trying to go into the house.
[285:27.82]Look what I caught on my ring cam.
[285:29.32]He's grazing.
[285:32.58]Okay.
[285:52.71]Hi.
[285:54.71]I'm here with my horse.
[285:55.67]I'm here to say hello.
[285:57.79]Thank you.
[285:58.09]If I could come in, that'd be great.
[286:02.50]Nice.
[286:03.30]Yeah, this is perfect.
[286:04.10]Look at this.
[286:05.90]What do you think?
[286:10.44]Be petted.
[286:11.14]Oh, nice.
[286:14.30]He doesn't really like his head to be petted.
[286:17.81]He doesn't like his head being touched.
[286:19.99]I'm trying to tell you.
[286:20.85]He doesn't like his head being touched.
[286:24.13]Alright.
[286:24.37]Well, he didn't listen.
[286:49.67]Where did he go?
[286:57.73]I'm just soaking wet.
[287:01.44]Sitting on his nice leather couch.
[287:07.90]What's going on downstairs?
[287:19.64]Alright, that's the ultimate.
[287:20.68]Like, my neighbor... My neighbor's dog shit in my front lawn.
[287:25.23]Okay, I'm kind of getting sick of that.
[287:26.77]You come with the dog, the dog shits in my front lawn.
[287:28.85]Imagine if it was a horse.
[287:30.59]And there was this, like, eight-pound horse dump on your front lawn.
[287:35.31]That'd be horrible.
[287:39.72]Oh, video games to play.
[287:41.32]What?
[287:43.92]What's wrong?
[287:50.05]What's wrong?
[287:56.31]What's- what's going on?
[288:05.44]Um... Are we-?
[288:14.06]Why did I do that?
[288:15.80]Ow!

[288:24.05]Where am I supposed to... Watch TV?
[288:39.66]I'm not going to meteor strike the house.
[288:41.23]Not yet.
[288:42.65]Maybe in a minute.
[288:47.57]I want to see what's going on here.
[288:50.66]Okay, we're hanging out.
[288:52.74]Watching TV.
[288:53.38]Sponsor.
[288:55.72]Let's play.
[288:56.08]Oh.

[289:38.30]Mute the TV.
[289:39.54]Wait, I didn't get invited into the house.
[289:51.56]I didn't get invited in here.
[290:02.60]Did you kick something?
[290:05.67]Wait, what?
[290:06.75]Did he get kicked downstairs?
[290:08.03]I wasn't even allowed in the house.
[290:13.79]What happened in there?
[290:36.88]Um, you, so what happened was, I found him, I was, I just, I went in here, and, like, somebody vented, and they, I saw them come and attack him.

[291:28.82]Get out!
[291:29.62]Go home!
[291:30.52]Go home!
[291:31.32]Run home quick!
[291:33.04]Run home!
[291:44.03]Everybody out, everybody out, out, out, out, out.
[291:45.85]Everybody out, everybody out, everybody out.
[291:47.85]Get out, get out, get out, get out.
[291:48.93]Did we make it out?
[291:55.82]Did he make it out of the house?
[291:58.86]Did he make it out?
[292:00.06]He's just like, I'm getting out of here.
[292:03.26]Where's the sus guy?
[292:04.69]Alright, thank god.
[292:07.59]Everybody out.

[292:19.18]Wait.
[292:24.36]I can't go.
[292:25.00]I can't.
[292:30.32]I can't look in the house.
[292:36.32]Somebody was making microwaved food downstairs.
[292:41.93]I can't look in the house anymore because they're all out of it.
[292:48.20]Oh my god, that's so stupid.
[292:51.08]Holy shit.
[292:51.84]Okay.
[292:52.58]Well... We made it.
[293:05.54]Who's brushing their teeth?
[293:08.47]Sell the space rocks?
[293:12.06]No, I can't.
[293:20.80]Do it again?
[293:21.80]Just go into every house and destroy.
[293:23.24]I'm not going to destroy every single house I'm in.
[293:35.35]Oh, shit.
[293:38.72]He got hit.
[293:41.38]I thought I made it out okay.
[293:55.07]I guess I was wrong.
[293:56.19]What happens if I take a shower?
[293:59.55]Do I clean it off if I take a shower?
[294:15.82]Alright, where's the horse?
[294:22.22]The horse is... Okay.
[294:23.35]The horse needs to sleep though.
[294:24.37]Everyone get out of the way.
[294:31.27]There we go.
[294:31.73]He's fine.
[294:34.73]Jeremy.
[294:36.73]Intagious?
[294:41.77]Please kill the sus guy?
[294:43.11]Okay.
[294:53.90]Not yet.
[294:57.82]We need to have a party.
[295:01.81]It's time to party.
[295:05.43]How's everybody else doing?
[295:08.87]Is an enemy in?
[295:09.71]Okay, the cat's all wet.
[295:12.65]Let's actually bathe the cat.
[295:15.22]Yeah, the cat needs a bath.
[295:20.94]It's all wet and shit.
[295:22.37]You don't know how to pick the cat up.
[295:29.71]Are you serious?
[295:31.33]Run Tilda, can you handle this?
[295:34.15]This guy is apparently too much of a moron.
[295:40.77]Why, why not?
[295:49.23]Do the cat noise?
[295:49.95]Alright, fine.
[296:13.15]Cat noise, cat noise.
[296:15.33]Yeah.
[296:18.39]Uh, that dog barking?
[296:20.95]Yeah.
[296:23.50]Sure.
[296:24.12]Dog bark.
[296:27.52]Okay.
[296:50.09]Cat, I want you to go to sleep, please.
[296:58.33]What are you doing?
[297:02.35]Oh, Gronti's making the onions.
[297:04.21]She's creating onions and dropping them on the ground.
[297:17.51]I feel like this is what my dog looks like when he's asleep.
[297:21.99]Alright.
[297:22.17]Alright, you're practicing magic.
[297:23.95]Cool.
[297:45.44]Why don't you go get into some mischief or something?
[297:50.45]Yeah.
[297:50.69]Alright.
[297:51.07]Grunty, let's go.
[297:56.69]This is pretty cool.
[297:57.27]What's this place?
[297:59.46]Who lives here?
[298:16.02]Kill them.
[298:18.96]Wait, is this like a business?
[298:21.83]What is this place?
[298:31.45]I just turned on all the lights.
[298:32.49]Okay.
[298:47.77]How do you smell?
[298:48.91]Your hygiene's fine.
[298:50.17]I'm just gonna wait out here, I guess.
[299:16.40]Be invited inside.
[299:17.26]Alright, nice.
[299:22.80]Where are you?
[299:25.02]Oh, there you... Oh, Thornton.
[299:32.63]It's 4 a.m.
[299:33.73]Oh.
[299:35.23]It is 4 a.m.
[299:35.87]You're right.
[299:42.14]Why don't you... You want an onion?
[299:47.40]Who lives here?
[299:48.72]This place is crazy.
[299:52.97]I'm gonna sneeze the whole bike gone.
[299:55.29]I'm alright.
[299:56.31]What?
[299:56.65]What the hell?
[299:57.69]Enthuse about magic.
[300:00.99]Did you just tell me to leave?
[300:16.21]You guys like magic?
[300:23.06]What was that?
[300:33.89]Wait, she's got magic too!
[300:35.57]Holy shit.
[300:35.99]Okay, wait.
[300:36.91]There's another magician out there.
[300:38.71]Do we have a Harry Potter duel?
[300:40.87]Poke eyes.
[300:41.17]Poke eyes.
[301:03.82]Be careful with those spells.
[301:05.12]They're very dangerous.
[301:06.14]I told you to be careful with that spell.
[301:18.33]She's fine.
[301:25.91]I didn't even do that.
[301:26.77]She did.
[301:28.81]She's about to flex on this girl.
[301:31.26]Did I hear somebody doing magic out here?
[301:37.78]Am I about to fuck up their toilet?
[301:40.66]They're casting Ice Blast into the toilet.
[302:05.91]What'd I do?
[302:07.39]Chest break?
[302:31.69]Stiles McGaw?
[302:35.70]Who's this guy?
[302:46.20]Alright, I'm not gonna do that anymore, I swear to God.
[303:13.58]I'm living in power!
[303:21.00]Wait, now they're friends?
[303:28.23]Now what?
[303:28.89]Do I mourn death?
[303:30.37]High five death.
[303:31.53]That was a good one.
[303:33.83]Ah, too slow.
[303:44.33]Get out of my face.
[303:52.59]Get me out of here.
[303:53.91]Get me out of here.
[303:54.96]Get me out of here.
[303:56.36]Get me out of here.
[303:57.12]Get me out of here.
[303:57.92]I'm gonna drop a meteor in a second.
[303:59.16]I gotta get out of here.
[304:07.18]Where's this guy?
[304:07.79]Oh, he's here.
[304:08.47]Oh.
[304:11.41]Wait, what?
[304:11.91]How many... Shut up.
[304:16.94]Quiet.
[304:36.95]I'm not doing anything.
[304:38.95]Ice blast.
[304:40.01]I didn't... I'm just turning their AC up.
[304:43.57]I'm not doing anything else.
[304:45.09]She's doing this on her own.
[304:45.89]I didn't tell her to do this.
[304:47.69]I'm putting their AC at like 55.
[304:52.98]Only in the bathrooms.
[304:54.20]Why?
[304:54.50]So they're gonna go to the bathroom.
[305:10.14]Then someone's gonna be like, oh my god, it's so cold in here.
[305:26.35]Poisoned apple?
[305:27.31]Oh, guys.
[305:33.33]Guys, guys, guys, guys.
[305:36.56]Oh, that's where the horse was eating those.
[305:43.33]Oh, Jesus.
[305:44.17]No.
[305:53.66]Conjuring poison.
[305:54.70]They were just all over the ground.
[305:56.22]I thought they would... I was wondering, what are these?
[306:05.25]Onions?
[306:05.53]Why are there apples on the ground?
[306:06.55]Oh.
[306:12.73]Okay.
[306:15.99]Great.
[306:16.79]No, no, no, no, no.
[306:18.29]Joke about... Joke about her cooking?
[306:26.94]I don't even know these people.
[306:28.44]Why... This house is so full bloom.
[306:37.41]It's horrible.
[306:40.72]Your cooking sucks.
[306:44.40]And that's very funny.
[306:46.52]Like, let me finish it for you?
[306:48.90]Okay, well, here you go.
[306:50.08]I made waffles.
[307:09.05]It was chicken, thyme, rosemary, and like a white sauce in there, but I made it into waffles somehow.
[307:16.93]I thought I was cooking it in the sink.
[307:21.46]What's wrong?
[307:21.80]What?
[307:22.94]Leave me alone.
[307:23.36]Here, have a good luck charm.
[307:46.25]You have to rhyme everything you say while playing with Gruntilda.
[307:50.99]Okay.
[307:57.61]I have some food for you over here.
[308:02.10]Oh, my dear, it's very clear.
[308:03.46]Butter syrup.
[308:07.88]Toasty bottom.
[308:12.96]Have some...
[308:14.62]Wash it down with orange juice.
[308:17.30]Don't you want them?
[308:22.39]I'll take a piece of... I'll eat it myself.
[308:27.07]Make sure you're a good boy to please the elf on the shelf.
[308:29.35]Are they going to eat this?
[308:41.28]Oh, good luck charm.
[308:47.80]Oh, wow.
[308:48.62]Thanks for the good luck charm.
[308:50.72]Look, butter.
[308:52.12]Get the fucking camera in there.
[308:53.14]I gotta see what I'm doing.
[308:58.03]Oh, Bugleberry.
[309:08.96]Apologize.
[309:09.62]Hmm.
[309:10.06]Hmm.
[309:10.24]Hmm.
[309:18.38]What was that?
[309:24.44]What was that?
[309:26.60]What was that?
[309:33.98]Look at this microwave.
[309:37.08]It looks like it belongs in fucking heaven in Diablo 3.
[309:39.62]It's like Tyrael's microwave.
[309:53.37]We have a water balloon fight with Thornton Wolf?
[309:56.21]Is this the guy who owns the house?
[309:57.23]Let's talk about money.
[310:03.47]I have a house.
[310:04.07]I have money.
[310:05.91]You've seen this house.
[310:06.75]It's beautiful, isn't it?
[310:11.34]I don't care about your house.
[310:12.82]I don't care about your money.
[310:16.94]You think I'd give a shit?
[310:31.27]um are we getting married ribby twibbs yablarco what's happening right now

[311:32.78]I hate doing dishes.
[311:34.00]Yeah, it's the worst.
[311:39.24]You're gonna freak out when she comes up here?
[311:47.40]Hold on, I'll leave in a minute.
[311:49.10]I'm gonna go ice blast your bathroom.
[311:52.04]She doesn't even care.
[311:56.05]He's gonna get on a Zoom call.
[311:58.91]He's gaming.
[311:59.99]Complain about Thornton.
[312:01.45]The guy that's on fire right here.
[312:21.28]Literally just burnt to death.
[312:23.54]Oh, shit.

[313:52.61]Don't do it, don't do it.
[314:04.83]Don't do it.
[314:06.95]What's he doing out here?
[314:08.29]Am I gonna get scolded?
[314:11.73]Oh, he's pissed at me.
[314:14.29]He's pissed.
[314:19.48]I made him ugly and he ran away.
[314:50.13]Hey, I wanna do that too!
[315:06.58]That's it?
[315:06.82]You can only swim for five seconds?
[315:08.18]Let's do a hold breath contest.
[315:15.78]A hold breath contest.
[315:21.52]Come on.
[315:21.96]Let's do a whole breath contest.
[315:37.45]That's why you wear shoes.
[315:39.05]That's why you're moving too fast.
[315:40.69]That's why you wear shoes.
[315:45.72]Put on shower shoes.
[315:47.08]Don't run around the edge.
[316:03.63]That's what happens.
[316:04.15]You gotta make sure you be careful around the pool.
[316:16.53]What am I doing?
[316:31.70]I'm making her like poke her eyes and stuff.
[316:36.18]Did I see that?
[316:38.06]What happened?
[316:39.94]What did I miss?
[316:43.42]Do you even see that?
[316:44.34]What was I looking for?
[316:53.59]I own this pool.
[317:00.66]Oh, no.
[317:09.93]Here, here's a good luck charm.
[317:15.43]And then I'm going to leave.
[317:20.56]What's the kill count, Dad?
[317:22.88]Five?
[317:24.46]Although, like, no.
[317:25.20]Okay, ten, but, like, four or five of those were accidental.
[317:27.62]I don't count them.
[317:28.52]Oh!
[317:40.95]Does anyone else feel like we haven't moved?
[317:47.05]Like, who's next are we going to pull out of the cage here?
[317:53.77]So they go do something weird, right?
[317:55.11]They're just waiting in the sidelines for me to grab them and have them go do something insane.
[318:12.04]One of them has to die.
[318:20.37]I'm choosing right now.
[318:28.13]The horse is going to bite somebody in the neck.
[318:37.63]Ratchet's the weakest link?
[318:38.81]I don't think so.
[318:39.31]I think it's the sus guy.
[318:46.73]We've had a story arc with the rat.
[318:50.08]Elephant dude.
[318:51.08]We had a story arc with Gruntilda.
[318:53.82]We had a story arc with the horse.
[318:57.24]And Ratchet's just so ugly I have to keep him around.
[319:15.18]Alright, I want the horse to bite somebody in the neck.
[319:16.62]Or the cat.
[319:18.96]Let's have the cat bite me in the neck.
[319:23.98]Vote out?
[319:24.64]Do a poll?
[319:25.74]Alright, fine, fine.
[319:27.07]Who are we voting off the island?
[319:28.39]Because I can't take care of this many people.
[319:29.67]There's too many people.
[319:32.23]There are five people in The Sims.
[319:34.71]You may as well... You can't take care of five people.
[319:39.99]Hmm.
[319:46.50]Five adults in The Sims is impossible.
[319:50.84]In the same house.
[319:51.36]We got five people.
[319:57.88]By the way, the animals are not on this list.
[319:59.64]They have immunity.
[320:00.18]Hahaha.
[320:14.79]Kill the sus guy but act like you're voting him out on Among Us.
[320:18.96]No.
[320:20.02]Just pretend I did that.
[320:21.02]I don't want to do that.
[320:25.66]Irma is the RTS player that thinks having more than one base is cheating.
[320:35.54]Well, the difference in The Sims is if you have multiple households, they autonomously play themselves and you jump between the houses.
[320:45.25]You don't play all four or five houses at the same time.
[320:49.35]By the way, delete that one half-built farm that's in the corner.
[320:54.78]You're a dick.
[320:56.90]And you were the reason why I didn't play online.
[321:12.19]I never got good at being able to macro two plus bases in RTS.
[321:16.05]I don't want to do that either.
[321:21.06]As long as one builder is alive, I haven't lost.
[321:23.14]Yep.
[321:28.42]Make a big table with a red button for an emergency meeting.
[321:31.37]I'm not going to do that.
[321:33.41]Oh my god!
[321:36.19]I'm trying to move away from the Among Us shit.
[321:43.33]Alright, it's perfect.
[321:44.22]I have to do it.
[321:50.12]What's it?
[321:50.44]Like a baseball?
[321:51.30]What's red?
[321:51.82]Is there any red button things?
[321:54.48]Like a balloon?
[322:07.77]I mean, that's like a big red thing.
[322:13.36]Use the style tool?
[322:21.34]Is there a style tool?
[322:24.60]How do I do it?
[322:25.06]Style.
[322:26.62]Blueprints.
[322:27.11]Sledgehammer.
[322:29.07]Style.
[322:29.73]Okay.
[322:29.89]Aww.
[322:30.05]Really?
[322:33.87]Really?
[322:38.46]Really?
[322:38.74]I can't do that?
[322:40.70]Is there a hotel bell?
[322:45.39]It might be.
[322:52.81]Have I joined into?
[322:53.61]We're about to do an emergency meeting.
[322:55.15]To see who's going to be voted off in the... Whatever.
[322:59.38]You know the game that everyone's... Whatever.
[323:01.26]It doesn't matter.
[323:03.08]Red fire alarm.
[323:04.82]Hmm.
[323:13.68]I think it has to be in a wall.
[323:14.56]I think that red fire truck is fine.
[323:25.02]Perfect.
[323:25.28]Alright, there's the button.
[323:37.69]Who are we shipping out?
[323:50.88]Okay, everybody get up.
[323:51.76]Oh, the pole isn't over.
[323:54.72]Okay, okay.
[323:55.74]We got one, two, three.
[323:57.26]We're going to have cheers.
[323:58.27]Come on.
[324:18.76]Henry?
[324:21.20]Really?
[324:25.36]Really?
[324:26.38]I'm surprised.
[324:27.12]I didn't think it was going to be Henry.
[324:31.33]I thought it was going to be Ratchet.
[324:37.33]Okay.
[324:38.13]Well, let's have a meeting here.
[324:40.67]Everybody get up.
[324:41.19]Pause the game.
[324:45.31]Pause.
[324:45.53]There it is.
[324:47.03]Get up.
[325:03.37]Okay, we got everybody sitting.
[325:04.41]Sasuke.
[325:05.23]Make sure they're sitting in the right chairs.
[325:09.63]Okay.
[325:11.55]Cat's gonna be here too.
[325:12.37]Sit down!
[325:35.88]Don't sleep in that sleeping bag.
[325:43.95]Where's Henry?
[325:48.85]Everybody get in here.
[325:49.57]No, stop.
[325:51.79]Everybody stop moving.
[325:54.21]Stop.
[325:54.83]I'm just going to break his neck.
[326:02.08]They won't.
[326:09.15]Oh, he made it to the meeting.
[326:28.65]What happened?
[326:29.79]Why is everybody not here?
[326:30.71]I thought we were going to vote on who, who's the one we kick out.
[326:35.49]Oh, I don't know.
[326:36.15]I guess not.
[326:38.22]No.
[326:40.93]I wonder who it was.
[326:41.71]Turn off free will?
[326:52.36]Oh.
[326:52.44]How do I do that?
[327:03.04]How do I do that?
[327:16.68]Alright, everybody sit down.

[368:14.49]Nobody lives here.
[368:15.78]How many people have I killed?
[368:25.96]Scratch on door.
[368:40.18]For a second in my brain, I thought that was the cat pretending to be a human.
[368:45.32]Sneaking around, it was weird.
[368:53.15]I don't know why.
[368:53.67]I was like, why am I a person?
[368:59.06]Okay, here we go.
[369:00.44]Let's see if they let me in.
[369:01.96]Oh!
[369:31.55]You're just not going to do it?
[369:39.82]Wait, they let me in.
[369:49.60]What the fuck just happened to that dog?
[370:09.99]Why is there a pool that goes through your living room?
[370:19.10]Tegua?
[370:40.84]Oh, he jumped away!
[370:41.62]Uh... I can invite all the people to this house?
[371:18.04]Can I just invite three horses over here?
[371:47.02]Who am I inviting over here?
[372:11.91]Using the test sheets.
[372:13.17]Oh, okay.
[372:16.35]Let's just see what happens.
[372:17.01]I invited, like, three horses over.
[372:21.03]Alright, let me... Alright, let's talk about the plan going forward.
[372:25.17]So... I was supposed to play Deltarune today.
[372:28.56]But I didn't.
[372:29.78]And that's mainly because I didn't play Deltarune Chapter 1.
[372:32.24]And I also kind of felt kind of shitty yesterday.
[372:37.04]But... Um...
[372:46.72]Okay.
[372:48.30]Here's the whole game of Clue just showed up.
[372:54.28]Yeah, so the plan is I still want to do Deltarune.
[372:58.30]I want to play Deltarune, but I still want to do Chapter 1.
[373:03.71]So we're not streaming tomorrow.
[373:06.19]I'm not going to be live tomorrow.
[373:08.29]But I will be live on Wednesday with Deltarune.
[373:12.26]And that shop game probably.
[373:15.56]And then we'll be live again on Saturday with something else.
[373:22.05]Rain is really loud.
[373:22.95]Are they trapped in here?
[373:26.13]What are they doing?
[374:02.81]No, they all left!
[374:03.81]They all got in the car and left!
[374:05.38]What the fuck?! !
[374:12.76]I'm done.
[374:22.53]They just zipped away.
[374:23.81]That was ridiculous.
[374:24.63]Alright, yeah.
[374:25.17]I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[374:27.21]Deltarune and... Oh, that pawn shop game I want to finish.
[374:33.34]That was The Sims 3 with a bunch of mods.
[374:37.02]The Sims 4 mods are, I think, a little bit better.
[374:41.66]There's a lot more, I think, crazy things you can do in The Sims 4.
[374:44.85]Just because there's like two or three people that have made these total conversion full mods, right?
[374:50.71]But that was still a lot of fun.
[374:53.11]That was really funny.
[374:54.09]Some of the shit was just outrageous, like it usually is.
[374:57.00]How was my birthday?
[374:57.56]It was great.
[374:59.12]It was really, really good.
[375:02.58]So we'll see you in the middle of the week on Wednesday for Deltarune, and then I'll be live on Saturday, too.
[375:13.80]That was Hobbit Day.
[375:14.74]It was great.
[375:21.54]I would have probably sat and played a little more, but... No, I... Once you start dropping meteors, once you start attacking people and just killing ra- like, it's over at that point, right?
[375:38.15]That's why I wanted to hold off on dropping a meteor for as long as I could.
[375:41.47]At least a few hours.
[375:45.62]I dropped him on the beach.
[375:49.06]If you give me the toy, I'm going to play with it.
[376:02.62]He dropped a meteor five minutes in.
[376:04.15]Yeah, but then we restarted and I waited like two hours.
[376:10.58]Delta run, Deltarune one or two on Wednesday, two.
[376:14.98]I already played the first one on stream a couple of years ago when it came out.
[376:19.36]But I forget everything and I don't just want to play the second one without remembering anything from the first one.
[376:28.84]So I'm going to refresh my brain on it, probably play it tomorrow.
[376:32.69]Just off stream.
[376:34.35]Maybe Tuesday.
[376:37.91]But I didn't play it.
[376:38.63]Yeah, I just didn't get around to it.
[376:46.33]Boys for big boys.
[376:56.97]Chapter two is about six to eight hours.
[376:58.79]Oh, wow.
[377:01.81]I'm looking forward to it.
[377:10.17]Thanks for the subs.
[377:10.71]There was a lot of them today, too.
[377:11.97]I really appreciate it, guys.
[377:12.81]Thank you.
[377:14.69]We'll see you on Wednesday.
[377:24.68]Oh, light bulb.
[377:26.60]Bathroom light bulb?
[377:27.54]I'm trying to figure out what that person's trying to say.
[377:37.90]There's a super secret Easter egg.
[377:39.38]I don't even want to read that.
[377:40.22]I don't want to read that.
[377:44.40]Secret Easter egg?
[377:45.36]I'm just going to pretend like I didn't see that.
[378:00.33]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[378:01.81]Have a good week.
[378:02.79]See you mid-week.
[378:03.85]Good night.
