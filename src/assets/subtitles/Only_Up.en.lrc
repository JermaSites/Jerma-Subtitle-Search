[00:21.72]Why hello there.
[00:28.20]How are you?
[00:31.74]Happy Father's Day to all the fathers.
[00:38.41]Just get that right out of the way.
[00:40.45]Happy Father's Day.
[00:45.66]Happy Father's Day.
[00:48.68]well I'm a dog dad so thank you hope you're doing good welcome said today or tomorrow we were going to stream and well I was going to stream it was going to be either Sunday or Monday and it turned out to be Sunday
[01:17.27]We are going to play for a few hours.
[01:18.69]I'm just going to probably play for, maybe, we'll see.
[01:21.37]We'll see.
[01:21.69]This game is called Only Up.
[01:27.63]The game is impossible.
[01:31.04]I don't, there's not, there hasn't been one person that's played this game that's gotten past the halfway point.
[01:36.32]At least that's what I had a dream about.
[01:38.22]So I just figured it was true.
[01:44.52]Did Lud beat it?
[01:45.04]Did Ludwig beat it?
[01:49.70]Well, yeah.
[01:50.42]I mean, he's a gamer.
[01:52.91]Ludwig is a gamer.
[01:54.71]Lud crushed it.
[01:57.53]Squeaks beat it, too?
[02:00.11]Well, who didn't beat it?
[02:02.45]What streamer didn't beat it and Rage quit it in an hour?
[02:05.57]Because, like, what category can I be in?
[02:09.67]Like, who Rage quit it in, like, an hour and a half?
[02:14.92]You.
[02:16.42]I'm not going to be the only one.
[02:19.61]It's just gonna be me?
[02:24.85]Well, whatever.
[02:25.57]I beat Jump King, the base game, so that's fine.
[02:35.16]XQC, Alt, F4'd.
[02:40.62]I'll probably do that too, honestly.
[02:43.36]I bet that happens here too.
[02:45.75]Although, I don't think I'll alt F4.
[02:47.77]I will just stop moving and complain about the game for like 25 minutes in the end stream.
[02:55.66]You have to restart entirely if you close the game?
[03:02.74]Wait, does... Well, don't spoil it for me.
[03:05.42]I haven't seen anything.
[03:06.40]Are we going to do face cam today?
[03:12.11]Yeah, sure.
[03:13.19]If you're good.
[03:16.06]I'll make my assessment if you're good or not.
[03:18.76]And if you're good, I'll turn it on for exactly 15 minutes.
[03:26.94]Why is this moving?
[03:28.36]Hold on.
[03:28.56]Something's not right here.
[03:29.66]Hold on.
[03:30.76]This shouldn't be moving.
[03:33.24]Not right now.
[03:35.16]Oh.
[03:35.44]You can't hear me, but I'll explain in a minute.
[03:55.37]Get over here.
[03:56.81]What the heck?
[04:00.65]What the heck?
[04:02.51]God damn it.
[04:05.79]I tried to plug a controller in.
[04:07.09]This game does not support controllers and I got immediately sad.
[04:11.11]I was like, oh shit.
[04:12.93]I have to do keyboard and mouse.
[04:14.13]This is going to end very poorly.
[04:18.08]So the thing that my chair sits on is... It's on to make it so I don't ruin the carpet in the room.
[04:24.47]It's sitting on top of this, like, wooden thing.
[04:26.54]And the wooden thing was touching the desk, and the desk is touching the mic, so the mic was shaking.
[04:32.50]Alright, you guys ready?
[04:37.54]Let's go.
[04:40.62]This is only up.
[04:42.34]We're gonna start with no face cam.
[04:44.98]No face cam begin.
[04:47.66]There's one thing that I want to talk about.
[04:50.98]Very quickly.
[04:53.24]Grotto Beasts.
[04:56.94]the starter kit for Grotto Beasts has fallen under 10 percent availability we are under 10 stock remaining on the kits the packs there are a lot of them there's a lot of them so but the packs we did a reprint on the starter kit is not getting a reprint kit is not getting a reprint
[05:24.37]If you care, you care.
[05:25.63]If you don't, then let's play only up.
[05:29.01]But I did say that I was going to tell people that when it became a thing.
[05:34.42]I wanted to make sure people knew that.
[05:38.76]Also important, the kits, the packs that are in the kits have print one boosters in them.
[05:45.88]They always will be print one because we're not doing a second print.
[05:48.26]Somebody said, nah, I'm good.
[05:59.41]I did, I said I was going to, when we got under 10% of the remaining stock, I said I was going to bring it up.
[06:05.81]So, I'll probably bring it up again when we go kind of under 5%, because I know people were, you know, waiting.
[06:10.90]It's not a, it's not an inexpensive item.
[06:13.06]I know some people were saving up, and they were like, hey, can I, is it still going to be available in a few months?
[06:17.48]And I was like, let's find out.
[06:20.28]Turn the face cam on.
[06:21.34]You'll get it if you, and that's not being good.
[06:24.62]You're already proving that you're not being good today.
[06:26.24]Okay.
[06:27.47]Okay.
[06:29.13]I guess there will be no facecam then.
[06:33.45]Alright, this game's probably going to be pretty easy.
[06:37.13]Oh, don't look up.
[06:38.85]We need to get to the top.
[06:40.47]The top of that?
[06:40.97]We sure will make it.
[06:42.73]I wonder what awaits us there.
[06:44.80]The unknown is frightening.
[06:49.10]What?
[06:49.26]Alright, this is going to be a scenario where you wait 15 minutes.
[06:54.56]Like Far Cry 4.
[06:55.22]There's an elevator that spawns.
[06:58.04]Just watch.
[07:06.20]Alright, only go up.
[07:11.64]Do I need to know anything?
[07:17.88]Elevator!
[07:19.95]What?
[07:20.25]Actual elevator.
[07:21.07]Actual elevator.
[07:21.73]What?
[07:22.13]This is... I did not pre-play this.
[07:24.03]I swear to God, I promise you I didn't.
[07:28.07]What?
[07:29.09]Is this actually in the game?
[07:30.85]How do I use it?
[07:34.55]I did not pre-play this, I promise you.
[07:37.89]How do I activate it?
[07:39.79]Go up!
[07:45.53]Go up!
[07:47.05]I don't think that's gonna work.
[07:55.99]Should I start here?
[07:59.43]How do you go up?
[08:05.87]How do you play the game?
[08:06.75]Oh, okay.
[08:10.27]Slow walking.
[08:11.41]Slow motion is hold right mouse.
[08:15.06]Sprint is shift.
[08:16.06]Jump is space.
[08:16.80]Crouch camera.
[08:18.66]First person.
[08:19.48]Okay, well, how do I play?
[08:25.51]Can I hold that forever?
[08:30.34]Secret elevator bug fix.
[08:31.82]Some have already managed to use the secret elevator and get to the very top.
[08:35.68]What?
[08:36.88]Why did I not play this three days ago?
[08:38.52]I could have just ended stream in ten minutes.
[08:41.57]Alright, I see.
[08:49.39]I can go up here.
[08:52.35]Only up, right?
[08:57.34]Is there a starting point?
[08:58.32]Where do you go?
[09:00.08]Press 1?
[09:00.76]Alright, when they do the streamer breakdown of how high every streamer got off the ground, I'm going to be at like 4 meters.
[09:15.33]This is not good already.
[09:16.61]Alright, I got it.
[09:21.53]What are you playing?
[09:30.15]What the fuck is a meter?
[09:36.71]Must be American.
[09:39.59]You're finally playing Tears of the Kingdom.
[09:42.90]What you forgot to say was... You could be playing Tears of the Kingdom instead of this.
[09:50.68]Right?
[09:52.46]Whatever.
[09:55.13]Dude, you could be playing Tears of the Kingdom.
[09:58.13]Yeah.
[09:59.30]I also could eat a BLT on stream.
[10:02.22]That promise is fucking gone.
[10:03.68]Alright, let's just go.
[10:08.70]So, do you auto- you automatically grab onto edges.
[10:23.91]What?
[10:25.37]Why is it do- Okay.
[10:35.12]Is this a distraction?
[10:37.50]They play distractions.
[10:38.84]Alright, dude, they play distractions at you.
[10:42.07]There we go.
[10:56.19]I'm already almost halfway through the game.
[10:57.57]I'm doing good.
[11:03.37]Stop.
[11:04.45]Does everybody else's game do this?
[11:05.99]I mean, hurry up.
[11:10.33]I mean, learn from my mistakes.
[11:24.61]This is fucking me up so bad.
[11:26.05]How do I get up?
[11:35.49]Turn.
[11:35.91]I gotta turn.
[11:36.27]I'm turning the music off.
[11:37.23]Because this is... Why can I still hear it?
[11:46.00]Okay.
[12:00.88]we'll just go away if I get high enough can we get away from the person practicing the song I mean if you're practicing song is this wait what's this thing check that out yeah just keep going keep going
[12:28.04]Why is it repeating every sound?
[12:30.94]Just turn it off?
[12:32.35]And put on your own music?
[12:33.33]I just turned it all the way down and it didn't work.
[12:34.97]Uh.
[12:39.45]Oops.
[12:41.89]Just restart?
[12:43.65]I don't wanna re- I don't- do this all over again?
[12:45.33]Fucking whatever.
[12:59.50]Fall joke number one.
[13:00.34]No, I'm trying to reset the game so I don't get the... Okay, turn it back up now.
[13:04.26]That was easy to get to that point.
[13:06.77]Is he going to have a meltdown?
[13:27.88]No, I just... I don't want to get too far in the game and have it actually be I can't turn that off.
[13:37.39]Where the hell did I even start from?
[13:39.81]There.
[13:41.33]You got one guide?
[13:44.19]Did I?
[13:45.57]Was that one guy?
[13:46.07]What do you mean yes?
[13:52.03]That shit happens to everybody?
[13:55.94]Is that actually part of the game?
[14:00.22]What?
[14:01.46]No, you guys are full of shit.
[14:02.96]There's no way that's part of the game.
[14:10.54]It's definitely a bug.
[14:17.87]See, it would have started by now.
[14:20.47]I think I'm in the clear.
[14:23.29]It started right here.
[14:27.49]I don't hear anything.
[14:47.25]Hasn't repeated.
[14:48.11]Oh, God damn it.
[14:52.56]Why?
[14:54.22]Is that seriously part of the game?
[14:57.18]It can't be.
[15:00.62]I don't make mistakes.
[15:21.47]Okay.
[15:23.05]There's a lot of god rays in this game.
[15:26.87]The worst possible time to climb a gigantic structure with no harness is absolutely when the god rays are in your fucking face, dude.
[15:34.81]Do you go in one of these pipes?
[15:46.52]It's very hard to make a choice when you don't know where it will lead.
[15:51.99]It's so high.
[15:58.57]Uh... I'm gonna go... Alright.
[16:03.83]I'm gonna go left.
[16:08.59]This is... Okay, I cannot look over at chat.
[16:12.38]I can't look over at chat.
[16:14.72]If I look over at chat, I'll fall down.
[16:19.70]I'm gonna go very slow, I'm gonna take it very calmly.
[16:22.10]What the fuck did I do that for?
[16:31.33]I'm fine.
[16:32.49]I was supposed to go this way anyways.
[16:39.05]They definitely wanted you to go middle.
[16:42.03]Wait, I can walk!
[16:44.97]I forgot about walking.
[16:49.66]Alright, where am I?
[16:55.71]Jeez.
[16:56.13]Okay.
[17:03.81]Get some sunglasses!
[17:07.32]What the fuck?
[17:08.00]I can't see anything.
[17:08.76]I'm gonna go up here.
[17:21.02]God is calling you.
[17:22.02]Alright.
[17:27.33]I'm going that way.
[17:30.23]Just go.
[17:30.71]Wow.
[17:32.11]I forgot.
[17:32.43]You don't have to hold it.
[17:33.01]You just click once.
[17:38.13]Be very gentle.
[17:38.80]Okay.
[17:44.56]Oh my god.
[17:45.42]I forgot to run.
[17:46.48]Run.
[17:50.80]He's doing the same walk that you did in the Christmas stream.
[17:58.48]He kind of is.
[18:02.43]No, you're referring to the sounds.
[18:03.93]The like... Fucking dress shoe Andy.
[18:11.58]Oh, that's so stupid.
[18:12.46]I'm just going to look down.
[18:19.26]Stop reading chat.
[18:20.24]I know.
[18:20.82]I'm sorry.
[18:27.12]That's not bad.
[18:28.26]I'm doing alright.
[18:39.30]Where do I go from here?
[18:39.92]I don't have to jump from here, do I?
[18:48.47]Oh, shit.
[18:51.21]Down here?
[18:51.71]I mean, how do I get up to that?
[18:59.53]Go up.
[19:01.79]Yeah.
[19:03.19]Where's the correct up?
[19:09.35]Down there.
[19:21.18]Sometimes you gotta take a risk!
[19:28.06]I think it actually put me in a better position.
[19:29.44]I need- I gotta turn the volume up now.
[19:50.67]Can you guys hear it now?
[19:53.00]If I walk forward, will I just gra- Oh, there we go, yep.
[19:55.68]No, you have to jump.
[19:57.34]Okay, wait.
[20:00.40]What about here?
[20:03.80]Um... I think I'm going the right way.
[20:13.65]Look down, but go up.
[20:16.61]That's the strategy.
[20:18.27]Yeah, look.
[20:19.43]I got myself in a much better position.
[20:24.36]Oh dear, okay.
[20:25.42]This is a big deal.
[20:26.14]Don't even think about it, just do it.
[20:28.60]How- I guess I couldn't make it.
[20:37.52]That- the perspective was- The perspective was weird.
[20:42.96]I thought- So what was the point of that?
[20:45.33]Is that just full of shit?
[20:46.67]Can I not actually go that way?
[20:53.47]What?
[20:53.75]Oh, come on.
[20:55.51]It's alright.
[20:55.87]I'll get back up there in one second.
[20:57.13]Okay.
[20:57.27]Somebody said, God, I hate this game.
[20:58.45]I'm alright right now.
[20:59.57]I'll get back up there in no time.
[21:00.77]So there's no checkpoints.
[21:18.87]So if I beat this game with no checkpoints, and when they add checkpoints after a bunch of people complain, I get an accolade, right?
[21:30.80]You're never going to beat this.
[21:35.23]You have to beat it first, though.
[21:36.27]Hey, I beat pre-patch for Dan.
[21:41.97]I think I can beat pre-patch only up.
[21:56.90]Wait, I didn't go this way last time.
[21:59.11]Maybe I just shouldn't even go that way.
[22:07.07]Can I go up this way?
[22:08.73]No!
[22:08.89]Okay, I'm fine.
[22:24.37]I just see somebody bobbing their head with a guitar pick.
[22:28.15]Just... Nodding around, you know what I mean?
[22:35.66]Alright, here we go.
[22:36.38]Back to... Back where we were before.
[22:39.20]Alright, let me get a good... How do I do first person?
[22:42.78]Because that was obviously wrong.
[22:46.36]So let me figure it out.
[22:48.51]First person.
[22:49.13]How do I do it?
[22:50.25]C?
[22:53.47]Is it binoculars?
[23:01.55]I can play the game in first person.
[23:02.91]No, that's a bad idea.
[23:03.88]That's actually a terrible idea.
[23:08.20]Okay.
[23:09.88]That top right up there is wrong.
[23:13.76]Maybe I need to go right.
[23:16.10]I'm going to try going right.
[23:22.05]We've been good.
[23:22.69]Can we have the face cam for 15 minutes?
[23:24.63]Yeah.
[23:26.89]Yeah, you've been good.
[23:31.91]Yeah, you've been good.
[23:35.73]You get it.
[23:36.03]Okay.
[23:39.87]When are you going to do the Pee Wee Herman dance?
[23:45.04]When there's an opportunity to do a Pee Wee Herman dance.
[23:47.14]And that's not right now.
[23:55.54]Alright.
[23:56.36]Straight ahead.
[24:04.13]How the fuck do you do this?
[24:23.85]I'm just gonna go this way.
[24:24.59]Uh...
[24:39.73]Smart.
[24:41.61]Smart.
[24:55.04]Alright, walk.
[24:55.96]Do not run.
[24:56.62]Dude, this game is so bad for people that just want to, like, freak out and move their mouse around.
[25:07.72]You know what I mean?
[25:10.41]Sometimes I just want to just move my mouse fast.
[25:14.09]It's just like, this is bad for me.
[25:17.69]It means how many of you guys just kind of sit there and just go like move your mouse just wildly for half second sometimes.
[25:27.90]I probably should turn the sensitivity down too.
[25:31.97]You said you'd do the dance next time you were on cam with any music playing.
[25:41.90]I can't do the Tequila Peewee Herman dance to that guitar riff.
[25:47.14]Why am I not turning the right way?
[25:51.44]That was weird.
[25:52.26]I didn't like that.
[25:57.82]Alright, so look.
[25:58.92]What the hell?
[25:59.48]Let me get a better look.
[26:07.09]So this is too far.
[26:10.32]What about down a little?
[26:11.42]No, I can't- I cannot go this way.
[26:13.62]Can I jump up and grab the edge here?
[26:19.22]Wait.
[26:21.16]Can I jump up and grab the edge?
[26:30.32]Dude, alright.
[26:31.24]I- You gotta use logic.
[26:44.22]okay that doesn't do anything for me wait I need to get on that one there whoa that was way too far way too far well alright I'll do it how does how I don't know how far the jump went
[27:13.28]I just did a full sprint jump.
[27:15.96]I didn't, I can't, I'm not doing it.
[27:18.00]This is not, this is not Pee Wee Herman music.
[27:20.54]This is not Pee Wee Herman dance music.
[27:22.48]This is not Pee Wee Herman dance music.
[27:23.93]I'm not doing it.
[27:26.07]Shit.
[27:26.39]Alright.
[27:26.61]Well, I had, that's what, it's just one.
[27:29.29]Sometimes it's hard to choose the right path, but don't be afraid.
[27:32.89]God damn it.
[27:33.57]No.
[27:34.13]Go in the elevator?
[27:35.13]The elevator doesn't work.
[27:45.61]Do the lion pose at least?
[27:47.67]No.
[27:48.69]Is this, what is this, 2017?
[27:50.12]What do you mean, do the lion pose?
[27:55.16]Is this like 2018?
[27:56.20]Do the lion pose.
[28:03.97]Alright, I'm gonna get up there really quick.
[28:11.29]I get it now.
[28:12.61]So I wonder if it's a full regular run jump and not a sprint jump.
[28:17.68]I just, I don't know.
[28:18.22]I don't know what the trajectory, I don't know what the physics are.
[28:21.08]I don't know how far you go with a full jump.
[28:23.02]I don't know how short you go with a small jump.
[28:25.06]This is all things I have to figure out over the next 20 minutes before I all F4 and take like three months off.
[28:45.32]This happened.
[28:53.25]Okay.
[28:57.75]Boogers almost just flew out of my nose.
[28:59.43]People want me to do the E. Lee Herman dance.
[29:01.13]Alright.
[29:01.29]I gotta get to where I just was.
[29:16.45]Good luck.
[29:17.35]Okay.
[29:18.25]How do I get over there?
[29:28.95]That works too?
[29:37.17]Jerma's Pee Wee Herman Promise.
[29:40.37]No, this is not the way you think it- This is not- This is the wrong- This is the wrong tune.
[29:45.11]Okay?
[29:45.37]This is the wrong tune.
[29:55.34]Alright, I'm here.
[29:59.12]I'm actually here.
[29:59.82]I actually made it.
[30:01.18]I made it.
[30:01.56]Look.
[30:02.60]Alright.
[30:03.11]Burn this into long-term memory.
[30:05.85]Where did I go?
[30:07.53]That was right up the middle.
[30:09.87]That was right up the middle.
[30:13.19]And... I don't remember.
[30:15.47]Just don't lose.
[30:16.93]It's okay.
[30:17.31]Just don't fall off.
[30:17.79]I don't win.
[30:20.79]Is there a crouch or anything?
[30:21.71]Because this is freaking me out.
[30:30.43]Oh, God.
[30:31.93]Wait.
[30:32.63]Is this bait?
[30:33.39]I don't know what this does.
[30:35.87]That's bait.
[30:36.35]Wait, is this a checkpoint?
[30:41.32]Does this do anything?
[30:51.67]I think it's just a place to just sit for a minute and take a drink of water.
[31:05.18]Oh, that was good.
[31:14.64]What was that?
[31:17.33]Experience.
[31:17.85]Do you know how fast I can move?
[31:26.59]Here I am in one second.
[31:27.75]Next second, I'm gone.
[31:30.33]I don't know.
[31:31.07]I'm just... I'm coping because I think I'm going to fall.
[31:44.19]Okay.
[31:44.33]In games like this, sometimes you just have to go.
[31:46.23]Ah!
[32:00.01]This is bait too, because I'm gonna grab this and fall off.
[32:01.91]It's gonna squish my fingers.
[32:10.34]That camera is not fun.
[32:29.84]Okay.
[32:31.18]Now, once I get up to this pipe, I'm gonna just take a second.
[32:35.52]Just scared the fuck out of me.
[32:36.58]Huh?
[32:36.66]Oh, dude, there better be an arcade up there.
[32:56.99]That's what I would do.
[32:58.50]I would put, like, classic games up there.
[33:01.70]And they're free.
[33:02.96]You don't have to, you know what I mean?
[33:03.82]Just give, once you get up, what do you mean -2?
[33:05.54]What?
[33:07.98]I'm saying, like, that's a milestone.
[33:09.18]You get there and it's like, I can, I can play, like, a bunch of arcade games now.
[33:11.73]I can play, like, -2.
[33:16.25]Silence, all of you.
[33:18.71]That's what, I wasn't making a joke.
[33:19.75]I was making a statement.
[33:22.51]I wasn't, that was a statement.
[33:23.81]That was not a joke.
[33:26.69]I'm not touching that bed until I know where I'm going.
[33:34.19]What do you mean?
[33:35.01]I said it would be cool if there was an arcade up there.
[33:38.85]That was a statement.
[33:41.59]Alright, I know what you're doing.
[33:43.01]You're fucking with me because this is like the part where every streamer falls down and everybody goes...
[33:55.45]Does steam come out of this shit?
[33:56.57]Do I get blasted with steam?
[33:57.55]Oh, okay.
[33:57.89]Okay, I feel safe up here.
[33:58.88]I made it!
[33:59.94]Look!
[34:25.22]I gotta test his theory.
[34:28.90]Then fucking jump off.
[34:30.16]See who hits the ground first.
[34:41.15]Do a victory dance?
[34:43.38]Not yet.
[34:49.80]Can you grab and like kind of shimmy on the thing?
[34:58.90]How are they floating?
[34:59.58]Um, it's a video game.
[35:07.65]There's not even that much left in the game.
[35:09.01]It's not like that goes up for like another four hours of gameplay.
[35:16.89]Alright.
[35:18.15]It looks like... Hold on.
[35:19.59]Let me get a good view.
[35:20.15]Can I change the day-night cycle?
[35:21.67]Can it be like noon instead of 5 p.m.
[35:25.50]permanently?
[35:35.30]Risk!
[35:38.26]Okay, risk off.
[35:39.72]Risk on.
[35:41.94]If you want to go quickly, go with friends.
[35:44.08]If you want to go far, go alone.
[36:01.11]Uh oh.
[36:01.97]What do I do?
[36:04.05]Oh shit!
[36:06.16]I'm gonna land on it.
[36:06.64]It's fine.
[36:07.44]Okay.
[36:12.36]Can I- Can I move it faster?
[36:13.40]Do I have to, like, sprint to move it or something?
[36:15.86]How do I change it?
[36:16.40]How do I- Okay, I'm fine.
[36:16.96]Oh, no.
[36:22.26]Okay, okay, okay.
[36:22.80]How do I- How do I- How do I- Should I get off?
[36:24.04]Goddamn parents.
[36:37.12]I think this is all bait to scare you.
[36:39.36]I think I'm good.
[36:42.32]I want to look up to see.
[36:43.34]I think this ends.
[36:51.22]Dude, I don't know what to do.
[36:56.92]Should I just keep riding it?
[37:00.88]Where does this take me?
[37:04.76]In a game where you can fall and lose an hour of progress, I'm freaking out right now.
[37:08.10]I'm just gonna ride it.
[37:11.21]This is all bait to have you freak out and jump off.
[37:16.03]It's all bait.
[37:36.31]I made it.
[37:38.48]Okay, can you fail that or did I somehow accidentally do everything correct?
[37:41.98]I don't know what I did.
[37:42.54]You won't make it.
[37:43.26]You're a weak kid.
[37:44.96]Go back to the favelas.
[37:46.40]Your friends are there.
[37:47.56]Your destiny and life is there.
[37:50.30]You have to seek happiness there.
[37:52.26]Get a job in the favelas and live there.
[37:54.50]There are many like you.
[37:55.78]You have to be with them and not stand out.
[37:58.37]You won't make it.
[37:59.39]You're a weak kid.
[38:01.11]Go back to the favelas.
[38:02.53]Your friends are there.
[38:05.20]R1, R1, R1, R1, R1.
[38:09.56]Okay, so obviously that way.
[38:20.84]Put some music on?
[38:22.02]No, if I put music on, then I have to do the Pee Wee Herman dance.
[38:24.23]I know what you're doing.
[38:26.85]That's a Gotham scenario.
[38:28.81]That's a Gotham scenario.
[38:45.04]Okay, let me just assess this.
[38:48.56]I'm not doing too bad, so... Hold on, this is an omega jump?
[38:53.52]Right?
[38:54.25]I hope so.
[38:56.33]Yep.
[39:01.21]Holy shit, why did I just fall?
[39:10.52]Oh my god!
[39:25.67]To get to the new one, you first have to make a jump and get off the ground, not knowing what the future holds.
[39:34.59]I thought I missed that.
[39:35.39]I was going to say, how is it possible?
[39:36.61]Okay.
[39:46.16]Just have confidence.
[39:47.36]The only thing that matters in this game is confidence.
[39:50.34]Even if you fail, if you go, you're gonna fucking miss.
[39:56.05]There's a jump coming up.
[39:58.05]Jump, go, now.
[40:00.17]You've seen me do it a few times, and it's worked out, but sometimes it doesn't.
[40:02.49]What do you mean, wait?
[40:21.85]Was the worst sound you ever made?
[40:24.55]No, it is not.
[40:26.05]You've got like 13 years of audio clips of me talking.
[40:28.63]That's not possible.
[40:30.45]There's like a, there's like a three or 4,000 sound library of all the fucked up dumb sounds I've made.
[40:36.00]That is not one of them.
[40:37.88]That's not even on the tier list.
[40:39.28]That wouldn't even get an image, you know, like a PNG at the bottom of the tier list.
[40:43.50]No, sorry.
[40:44.83]You just, you're just wildly and you're wildly inaccurate.
[40:56.04]I wonder if that was a bad idea.
[40:58.98]No.
[41:01.21]Alright, where am I going?
[41:03.05]We don't think, we just go.
[41:06.85]Whoa!
[41:08.95]I thought I was slipping.
[41:10.17]I thought I was slipping off.
[41:14.94]What the fuck?
[41:15.74]Sometimes it doesn't catch.
[41:23.94]Okay, I gotta go slower here because these things are weird.
[41:37.45]Can I climb this pole?
[41:38.55]No way.
[41:41.53]No, we'll go on the shore thing.
[41:45.03]We'll go on the shore thing.
[41:48.92]I'm not messing around right now.
[41:59.62]Are those balloons up there?
[42:00.70]Okay, I want to get to at least the balloon part.
[42:09.18]What?!
[42:12.12]Are you talking about?
[42:13.33]What are you talking about?
[42:14.45]Why did it do that?
[42:16.35]Why did it do that?
[42:19.05]He just went... and then just fell.
[42:30.73]What the fuck was that?
[42:35.40]That was... You told me what was wrong with that jump.
[42:39.06]He just like scrunched up and put his head into his neck.
[42:42.62]And then... You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[42:46.47]What?
[42:46.57]I didn't make a mistake.
[42:47.11]What mistake did I make?
[42:56.92]That was clean!
[42:58.06]That was, and I told you, I knew that was, I knew that was, it was weird.
[43:02.69]The collision on those trains is like, fucked up.
[43:10.63]I got there once, I can get there, but that wasn't even that hard to get there, it's just pain in the ass.
[43:14.09]There's a slow-mo feature.
[43:15.31]Yeah, but I, I, forget about the slow motion, I...
[43:24.46]I literally just jumped onto the train!
[43:27.08]And it did that!
[43:35.36]You jump on the- give me- alright.
[43:38.92]What was the- I forget everything, I forget everything, I was too- Where's the- there's a car that I jump on and then I go from the car to the- where, over here, where is it?
[43:50.07]I don't remember, this was an hour ago.
[43:53.13]There's like a fence and a car.
[43:57.46]Get wrecked, pleb.
[43:58.66]I didn't even get wrecked.
[44:02.06]I did a good job.
[44:14.33]Where is the part?
[44:16.27]Turn this fucking sun off.
[44:19.37]Turn the sun off.
[44:31.99]Go in the elevator?
[44:34.05]Did I actually unlock a checkpoint?
[44:35.39]Are you guys fucking with me or is that real?
[44:51.29]There are no checkpoints.
[44:52.29]No.
[44:58.11]Why can I not find the car?
[44:59.69]Oh, it's over here.
[45:07.37]That was such dog shit.
[45:09.21]You all know it.
[45:10.03]Everybody knows it.
[45:10.75]We all understand it.
[45:13.39]I don't even feel bad about that.
[45:17.46]I would feel bad about that if I did something wrong, but... We did a poll.
[45:22.06]There's 20 thou- There's 21,000 people here.
[45:23.82]20,850 of you said that that was a game bug.
[45:26.40]And 50 of you said that I was a stupid gamer.
[45:36.44]It was overwhelmingly positive on my end.
[45:45.08]You were in a poll?
[45:46.32]Well, you were one of the 50 people that... That sucks.
[45:52.66]This is all... I'm just trying to not freak out.
[45:59.36]Stop spreading misinformation.
[46:15.54]How close is the sun in this universe?
[46:23.08]What the?
[46:23.52]Stop!
[46:32.20]Alright.
[46:32.72]It was right up the middle.
[46:34.14]And then I can go quick.
[46:35.74]I can do it quick!
[46:44.91]That's a top-knock shooter.
[46:46.77]In, uh, I don't know, the, uh, northwest, you know, where I've, at least, at least for what I know.
[46:54.83]It's like one of the best videos ever.
[46:57.38]Uh, it was this way, right?
[47:05.40]Was it a game bug?
[47:06.34]I'm just saying.
[47:09.54]Alright, I know how to get back here.
[47:13.60]Everything's fine.
[47:15.99]I don't want to go, I don't want to rush because there's more.
[47:17.87]Look, if you rush, you'll end up... What the fuck?
[47:28.08]There's an image.
[47:29.92]Whatever the fuck that image is.
[47:32.34]Alright.
[47:34.40]I made it.
[47:35.96]Don't rush because the time that you lose rushing and falling versus just doing it correctly...
[47:44.61]I just need to get to the balloons that I'm gonna ult out for.
[47:53.52]I'm gonna get to the balloons, do the Tequila Pee Wee Herman dance, and turn the stream off.
[47:58.21]That's the goal for today.
[48:14.81]So the image, I can't right now.
[48:16.78]Alt-tabbing and copying and saving and then exporting and rendering and then putting it into OBS.
[48:24.32]And I think OBS put the bitrate at a certain kilobits to make sure you can be seen and then watch the rendering on the OBS.
[48:30.69]I got to focus on this.
[48:32.73]Otherwise, I'll fall.
[48:38.60]And then to do the necessary legal paperwork to show it.
[48:42.04]And, you know, send out all the consent forms for people to sign and everything for showing it on stream.
[48:49.08]And it's just, it's just a lot.
[48:56.47]Shut up, nerd.
[49:15.78]You're plus twoing... You're plus twoing that guy.
[49:21.25]I crafted... I crafted a joke.
[49:24.45]And it was... It was like a fucking fine French cuisine meal.
[49:29.39]A guy calls me a nerd.
[49:32.57]And I lose the comedy war.
[49:40.28]Just shut up and go.
[49:41.72]Alright, here we go.
[49:42.40]I'm back to where I was.
[49:43.60]Pretty much.
[49:43.88]I have to ride the thing again.
[49:48.68]Let me just see what this does.
[49:51.82]I'm not gonna... It doesn't do anything.
[49:57.25]It moves you forward.
[49:58.15]Alright, we're not doing that.
[50:07.91]Chad Chatter versus the Virgin Jeremy.
[50:16.72]Shut up, nerd.
[50:28.53]What the f- what?
[50:30.09]You- it's not funny when I do it?
[50:38.25]That's not fair?
[50:38.97]What do you mean that's mean?
[50:40.89]Somebody just called me a nerd, it's not mean?
[50:55.09]I will show this one because it's really funny.
[50:58.81]I'm going to show this one because it's good.
[51:01.33]I'm just going to... Might as well.
[51:23.46]Oops.
[51:47.80]human I look like a different species alright don't distract me I'm working on something do you look like the teletubbies what about over here there's something over there am I too much of a coward to go look
[52:18.19]Yeah, I think so.
[52:22.85]Let's just do what I did before.
[52:25.13]Once I get off the rollercoaster, that's when I'm pretty much back where I was.
[52:28.82]Teletubby's son?
[52:29.98]Yeah.
[52:34.36]Risk on?
[52:37.12]Risk on.
[52:41.14]Risk off.
[52:46.39]Alright, we're just gonna sit here and just hang out.
[52:51.41]Can I actually fall off this or am I good just to hang out and look at chat and stuff?
[52:56.18]Is that okay?
[52:56.52]Am I going to get like... Just jump right now?
[53:06.61]No.
[53:07.49]Don't think so.
[53:12.25]Oh, that's good.
[53:15.37]Oh, I have to choose the directions?
[53:23.97]I didn't do that last time.
[53:28.82]I definitely was not doing that last time.
[53:32.66]Do I just have to look at it?
[53:34.88]I wonder if people are lying to me.
[53:35.96]It's probably true.
[53:47.78]I'm good.
[53:48.68]I'm good.
[53:48.92]That was a dangerous thing, kid.
[53:50.96]Don't do that again.
[54:01.84]Why is it so quiet?
[54:04.67]The volume's even turned up too.
[54:05.91]Why is the volume so low?
[54:17.45]Did you see the live action One Piece trailer?
[54:19.38]They go, yeah, yo, yeah, yo.
[54:21.58]Do they really?
[54:23.50]Do they actually do that?
[54:30.11]They do not do that.
[54:32.01]I I wouldn't bet any money, but I would friendly bet you that they do not do that Now I have to I'm busy I
[54:51.87]This is where I was before, and this is where it all became a disaster.
[54:55.78]Slow down.
[54:56.36]The game... This part of the game is fucked.
[55:02.57]Okay?
[55:05.07]Risk on.
[55:07.40]Risk off.
[55:21.58]There's a little bit of momentum when you land.
[55:23.10]Okay, slow it down.
[55:33.05]Where did I get caught up?
[55:33.83]It was right here, right?
[55:41.05]We're good.
[55:42.37]No, wait.
[55:42.89]It was after this.
[55:44.83]It was after this.
[55:45.45]It's up here.
[55:49.45]Up there.
[55:50.32]Oh, up there.
[55:52.35]I'm almost there.
[55:52.87]Alright.
[55:54.51]Yeah, yo.
[55:55.19]Yeah, yo.
[55:57.53]Give it up.
[55:58.01]Give it up.
[55:58.49]Give it up.
[55:59.01]Give it up.
[56:02.29]I don't even need to be up here, do I?
[56:05.15]This is kind of a mistake, but I'm kind of terrified to go any other way.
[56:08.93]This is the only way that I know.
[56:15.60]Risk on.
[56:19.26]Risk off.
[56:30.62]Alright, this is it over here.
[56:31.96]I got to make this.
[56:47.06]That is exactly where I lost last time, wasn't it?
[56:49.08]No, it was up here.
[57:04.26]Fall back to the beginning, it would be really funny.
[57:09.19]Alright.
[57:16.28]So, pay attention time.
[57:20.06]What the hell even happened here?
[57:35.46]It was right here.
[57:36.06]We're good.
[57:40.44]Alright.
[57:50.07]There's gonna be a hole that I can fall through.
[57:52.19]Or one of these is gonna open.
[57:53.47]One of these is gonna open up.
[57:54.46]A window's gonna open.
[57:55.32]Okay.
[58:01.44]Oh, shit.
[58:05.12]Is this a full sprint omega jump?
[58:09.95]Or do I walk on that?
[58:20.11]Oh, fuck.
[58:27.95]Risk off.
[58:31.22]I forgot to say it was on.
[58:44.07]Where are most of the balloons?
[58:44.75]Oh, that's gonna be so bad.
[59:01.73]That's gonna be so bad.
[59:18.78]My father worked here as a driller, and he always smelled of fuel oil.
[59:23.54]I was afraid of him and hoped that one day he wouldn't come back from work.
[59:28.60]He drank a lot and often beat my mother and me, but that's in the past.
[59:33.51]You'll never make it to the top.
[59:35.05]You'll never make it.
[59:35.69]You bastard.
[59:38.47]Oh, I'm still scared of him.
[59:45.64]Jesus.
[59:46.08]Alright.
[59:48.72]Assess.
[59:49.38]Assess first.
[59:54.38]No, I have to do this.
[59:56.14]So I have to go all the way over there and then... Well, I could go risk on and go that way.
[60:05.15]Let me look at it.
[60:18.19]Do not, do not, do not.
[60:20.07]Should I go?
[60:20.55]I could go risk on and do a full jump right now and just jump on that.
[60:25.44]Risk off, risk off.
[60:26.22]Okay.
[60:26.46]Alright.
[60:26.80]You sure?
[60:27.08]I think I'm doing it.
[60:28.68]Risk on.
[60:37.09]Risk.
[60:37.35]Alright.
[60:37.57]Fine.
[60:37.75]Risk off, risk off.
[60:39.05]Fine, fine, fine, fine.
[60:47.19]Oh my god, this thing is really fucked up.
[60:52.06]Okay, but... Do I want to go all the way over there, or do I just drop here and go that way?
[61:02.54]Now, there's nothing over there.
[61:04.30]Is this the only way to go?
[61:05.45]Yep.
[61:07.11]Oh, that does not look fucking good.
[61:10.77]Drop?
[61:11.05]Drop?
[61:34.02]You softlocked yourself?
[61:38.64]No, I didn't.
[61:39.04]Look right there.
[61:42.26]Oh, this is so fucked up.
[61:43.94]I actually can't even walk this way.
[61:47.32]But what about right there?
[61:50.32]What about... I'm so... That's a long way down.
[62:04.84]I can fix it.
[62:10.36]Oh, thank God.
[62:12.50]Oh, thank God.
[62:14.02]Thank God.
[62:15.14]Thank God.
[62:15.80]Thank God.
[62:16.48]Thank God.
[62:18.42]Thank goodness.
[62:22.69]I thought I was going to fall.
[62:24.52]Alright.
[62:25.18]Risk off.
[62:27.40]I don't know.
[62:27.92]Why would this even be here?
[62:30.10]This to me looks like a shortcut.
[62:32.06]It probably is.
[62:32.94]Risk off.
[62:43.12]You see how weird this thing is?
[63:00.51]You want a secret tip?
[63:02.73]I'm not looking at anything else.
[63:04.31]The only thing I care about is this kid's hat in the middle of the pipe.
[63:10.04]I'm not looking at anything else.
[63:11.88]Why would I pay attention to anything else?
[63:19.59]Uh-uh.
[63:21.09]Uh-uh.
[63:24.85]I mean, I'm just not going to do this.
[63:28.79]You know what I'm saying?
[63:30.87]No way.
[63:31.97]I'll miss it.
[63:33.57]I'm too far up.
[63:50.75]Oh my God.
[63:52.45]Just focus on the hat, you fucking idiot.
[63:55.43]I'm there.
[63:56.65]I'm right there.
[63:57.19]You can't crack under the pressure right now.
[63:59.45]You're literally 85% of the way done.
[64:20.75]Now where?
[64:21.19]Fuck.
[64:35.90]What's worse?
[64:38.60]The scary pipe?
[64:40.62]I know how to do the pipe.
[64:44.08]Wait, can I just do this?
[64:48.94]No.
[64:51.10]I know how to do the pipe.
[64:54.11]I've done it.
[64:54.59]I just did it before.
[64:55.63]I know how it works.
[64:58.03]I'm going for pipe.
[64:59.97]But I got to do an omega jump from here.
[65:02.99]Oh, just do it.
[65:03.83]Just do it.
[65:04.23]Risk on.
[65:07.35]Yep.
[65:10.77]Don't even think about it.
[65:11.35]Just go.
[65:28.94]Okay, give me a second.
[65:31.14]Captain Crunch is up here and he's laughing at me.
[65:34.58]And he's like fucking with me.
[65:36.16]I gotta get rid of him.
[65:37.36]Just give me a second.
[65:41.29]Captain Crunch is making fun of me right now.
[65:42.53]He's just like, oh, my Captain Crunch cereal is more nutritious than this fucking dope.
[65:47.63]He's up there and I gotta get rid of him.
[65:50.85]He's like laughing in the chat.
[65:51.97]I don't know why.
[65:52.51]It's like the white and blue hat.
[65:55.77]I don't know.
[65:56.27]I just...
[65:59.87]I saw the white and blue hat.
[66:32.78]I'm playing QWOP.
[66:36.46]Just do the fucking snail strategy.
[66:38.37]It works.
[66:49.92]I'm about to turn the risk on and just fucking run.
[67:29.32]This is a very effective strategy, but it's funny looking and I got... Hey, hey, hey, why is he turning this way?
[67:48.05]I didn't turn him that way.
[67:50.13]I didn't turn him that way.
[68:38.47]I'm not jumping from here.
[68:39.91]I'm not jumping from here.
[68:41.89]That would be a huge mistake.
[69:00.46]Did I just punch the bike?
[69:01.66]Oops.
[69:02.24]I'm sorry.
[69:02.60]I was doing the roar.
[69:06.20]Okay.
[69:07.84]Now what?
[69:08.18]I was doing the lion pose from 2018.
[69:12.69]Yeah.
[69:16.17]Be careful.
[69:16.83]Don't go too fast.
[69:17.72]I'm going to take a second here.
[69:20.28]Because I'll be honest with you, it's time for me to get a little, uh, just to toot my own horn a little bit.
[69:26.39]A lot of you thought I was going to fail at the pipes like 40 minutes ago, and I deserve an apology.
[69:34.01]I can wait.
[69:37.93]I think I deserve, I think I deserve an apology.
[69:48.75]We are not sorry.
[69:50.67]No, no, no, no.
[69:53.98]I'll get it eventually.
[69:54.76]If I get to the top, I'm gonna see a bunch of... Sorry, I'm so sorry.
[69:58.90]Oh my god, dude.
[69:59.76]I'm so sorry.
[70:00.58]You're so cool.
[70:02.52]Okay.
[70:06.33]Obviously... Oh, more pipe shit.
[70:12.49]Um... Yeah, that's the right way.
[70:24.01]This is very obviously the correct way.
[70:37.63]I'm so scared to jump and grab this.
[70:39.67]I feel like I'm not high enough.
[70:43.09]Am I high enough to grab this fucking thing?
[70:47.72]Oh my god.
[70:49.20]I almost dropped.
[71:05.64]Alright.
[71:07.80]He's high.
[71:08.44]I actually said to Holly before I turned the stream on.
[71:14.84]I was like, would I even be able to get past the first jump high if I did this high?
[71:19.05]She just shook her head.
[71:22.83]She just went... Okay, maybe I shouldn't do it.
[71:38.50]I just want us to remember this moment when I got here and we're just like hanging out.
[71:42.38]You were going to?
[71:43.76]No, I was just saying like, would I even be able to?
[71:46.69]I'm not talking about like, I'm just talking about in general.
[71:51.59]Um, let's just, can I just savor this?
[71:53.69]Because I'm probably going to fall in like 10 minutes.
[72:02.35]Ah.
[72:02.41]Alright, let's go back to walking.
[72:08.17]And I feel like I need to jump onto this.
[72:12.61]And we're just going to go straight.
[72:13.60]And I guess I have to go up that pipe, which is going to be unbearable.
[72:18.66]So don't do anything stupid.
[72:19.78]I've got plenty of time.
[72:21.54]It's not like I'm on a time limit.
[72:24.42]Some say that soon no one will need oil, but it is unlikely to happen sooner than in 20 to 30 years.
[72:30.79]And meanwhile, oil is still a resource that people kill for.
[72:41.63]I would make a comment on, you know, the world and the environment and shit, but I've... This is... I've... You know what I'm saying?
[72:54.25]I cannot fall off of this.
[72:55.21]Somebody said, okay.
[73:02.25]I would make... I can't make any comments right now.
[73:06.07]Turn risk on?
[73:11.31]Oh... Never mind, I'm not gonna say it.
[73:16.91]But can I... Am I gonna get it?
[73:18.45]Or is it gonna glitch out?
[73:31.85]Wait, what?
[73:33.69]Oh.
[73:37.90]This is not World of Warcraft, dude.
[73:39.56]You can't turn the camera to get a better view and then use W to go forward.
[73:43.92]I almost just did that.
[73:47.82]My fucking heart.
[73:49.12]Holy shit.
[73:50.36]I almost just did that.
[73:52.20]I almost did the World of Warcraft get a better angle.
[74:05.44]Only look forward, don't look back, don't look down.
[74:18.46]What's with this camera?
[74:19.16]Stop it.
[74:20.92]Camera, what are you doing?
[74:21.69]Stop doing this.
[74:22.91]What's with this camera right now?
[74:51.90]Oh my goodness.
[75:08.88]Everybody fails at that part because they don't get it.
[75:11.64]I do.
[75:23.62]I wonder if I jump from here, or do I go from the end and try to catch the side, or do I try to catch the perpendicular?
[75:39.69]Shave, you monster.
[75:40.71]I'm just going to go all the way down to my fucking chest.
[75:48.02]If it were me doing this, and it is, I'm going from here.
[75:52.28]And I'm actually terrified right now.
[75:54.98]But... The other part of me is saying, go to the end and grab onto the edge.
[76:16.10]Well, we just got a risk on.
[76:20.20]That's what you do.
[76:20.84]You just turn risk on.
[76:22.86]Sometimes you just have to do it.
[76:23.70]Just stop thinking about it and just go.
[76:31.00]Uh-oh.
[76:36.88]Just risk on.
[76:49.84]What the fuck is going on here?
[76:53.97]This is fucked up.
[77:03.41]Where?
[77:05.49]What?
[77:06.01]Okay.
[77:12.72]What?
[77:13.04]Hold on.
[77:13.66]Let's assess this.
[77:15.58]Risk on?
[77:16.08]No, no, no.
[77:16.40]Not yet.
[77:16.70]Not yet.
[77:17.12]I don't know if I can... I can't grab onto this.
[77:27.96]Risk on.
[77:29.54]Good call.
[77:31.76]I was completely risk off there and that was stupid.
[77:54.31]Let's fucking go.
[77:55.69]I thought that was the end.
[78:01.47]Oh, dear.
[78:02.63]No way.
[78:03.35]Whoo.
[78:20.78]OK, my hands are like kind of shaking.
[78:26.95]Jesus.
[78:31.68]Where are the balloons?
[78:32.34]Am I almost... I'm almost at the balloons.
[78:33.78]We're good.
[78:35.48]I'm literally shaking.
[78:42.03]I'm gonna go.
[78:43.79]Stopping now is a bad idea.
[78:46.71]I'm just gonna go up this pipe.
[78:49.76]Because, like, there's a bunch of shit over there.
[78:51.06]I could go... No.
[78:52.60]I see where I'm going.
[78:53.38]I'm going this way.
[78:55.88]Do it.
[78:56.16]Do it.
[78:56.42]Do it.
[79:04.47]Is this a boat?
[79:07.31]Oh, it's like a factory.
[79:16.93]Take it slow.
[79:17.79]I... Yep.
[79:18.53]I'm gonna take it slow.
[79:21.53]This is... This is here to fuck with you?
[79:26.23]Or no, it's not.
[79:27.29]Is it, though?
[79:33.43]It might be here to fuck with you.
[79:45.76]This might be a sprint jump.
[79:48.76]No, I don't think so.
[79:52.91]This is a sprint jump.
[79:56.29]Holy shit, I thought I was done.
[79:57.91]No!
[80:07.48]What?! !
[80:12.11]Oh, YouTube thumbnail.
[80:13.69]What the heck?
[80:15.27]I know, but seriously, like, what the fuck?
[80:24.76]Dude.
[80:27.32]Oh.
[80:29.36]I did it.
[80:30.94]I made it to the fucking factory.
[80:35.39]Jeez.
[80:35.91]Alright.
[80:36.45]Settle down.
[80:51.76]This does not look too bad, but who knows, right?
[81:43.63]There's a shitload left
[81:47.27]I'm almost at the balloons, which is where my... Okay.
[81:50.87]You know in Hearthstone Battlegrounds, when you... If you get in the top four, it's considered a win.
[81:57.95]That's my top four.
[82:02.06]I place top four in Battlegrounds.
[82:03.42]I don't care if I lose.
[82:04.24]I don't care if I get number one.
[82:15.89]Okay.
[82:17.23]Balloons.
[82:19.61]There's like the energy wind thing.
[82:27.04]This is not even 40%.
[82:28.54]Stop looking up.
[82:29.36]What?
[82:29.48]What are you talking about?
[82:30.90]I need to see where the fuck I'm going.
[82:35.18]Nothing else up here?
[82:36.04]No.
[82:36.26]This is the right way.
[82:37.44]I could go that way too, but no.
[82:38.81]That looks horrible.
[82:39.57]I almost just fell off right there.
[82:43.47]What a fucking blunder that would have been.
[82:46.48]Fourth place is third loser.
[82:49.94]You still get two points in Mario Kart.
[82:51.89]That's two points that number five doesn't get.
[82:53.31]I'm good.
[82:54.93]Your nose is sweating.
[82:56.07]Wipe the sweat from your nose.
[83:04.92]I wipe the sweat from my nose when you wipe the grease from your hair.
[83:15.14]What?
[83:16.76]We're bouncing back and forth today.
[83:22.77]I'm giving it back.
[83:32.60]Is it really bad?
[83:33.32]Hold on.
[83:33.50]Why are you so mean?
[83:38.92]Oh, I'm just bouncing it back.
[83:44.67]That works better if your hair doesn't look wicked greasy.
[83:50.58]Your hair is ten times greasier than mine.
[83:57.90]It only works if I'm clean.
[84:02.06]Please.
[84:03.72]Come on.
[84:04.18]Alright, no more messing around.
[84:07.22]I expelled a lot of that, like, nervous energy, right?
[84:09.82]Just like, you gotta get it out.
[84:11.26]Because this is about to get fucked up, so I gotta pay attention.
[84:14.62]Okay.
[84:15.64]We're just bouncing it back, dude.
[84:16.78]We're good.
[84:20.81]I said shiny, not greasy.
[84:24.23]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[84:26.19]I'm like halfway through this game that nobody thought I was ever going to make it to the piece of American cheese.
[84:31.66]And I'm sorry, but you were wrong and you're seething in chat right now.
[84:53.37]Jesus.
[84:58.89]What?
[84:59.77]Okay.
[85:00.25]No, I think it's alright.
[85:00.87]This is alright.
[85:02.04]I can't fall through the middle, I don't think.
[85:03.36]That would be weird if I could.
[85:07.22]Is this an omega jump, though?
[85:08.34]It might be- GO!
[85:09.08]I just have to scare the shit out of myself to do it.
[85:15.36]Hahahaha!
[85:21.15]What the?
[85:22.65]Shut up.
[85:25.59]Jeremy, not you, me.
[85:32.28]Stop that nonsense.
[85:42.77]Balloons!
[86:04.54]I almost just lost to a stupid slow motion joke.
[86:20.73]Okay.
[86:23.89]Train?
[86:24.88]Onto the train, maybe?
[86:25.74]I don't think there's anywhere else to go.
[86:35.39]This might be a bad idea.
[86:36.41]Let me go.
[86:36.81]I want to look.
[86:42.43]Did I miss something?
[86:43.09]I have to get on top.
[87:01.80]This is probably really fucking stupid what I'm doing.
[87:06.55]No, that's definitely right.
[87:08.36]That's absolutely correct.
[87:15.50]Happy Pride?
[87:15.90]That's right.
[87:16.58]It's Pride Month.
[87:17.90]Happy Pride, everybody.
[87:21.49]Happy Pride Month!
[87:29.05]Am I doing this wrong?
[87:40.35]I glitched through that.
[87:41.49]That felt fucked up.
[87:44.37]No, I can't even grab onto that.
[87:46.36]I'm paranoid to go in there.
[87:48.60]But I guess I'm going to.
[87:59.73]Oh, shit.
[88:02.47]Okay, well, I found where I need to go.
[88:05.93]I don't think this is right.
[88:07.13]I don't think I can make that jump.
[88:09.19]Even if it's an omega jump.
[88:10.37]Risk on?
[88:10.99]Fine.
[88:13.19]This camera sucks.
[88:15.81]That was... I'm stuck.
[88:20.24]That's not... That's not correct.
[88:22.60]Thank God it stopped me.
[88:23.36]There's no way that's correct.
[88:24.18]I got... It's... I went... I went... I went into an invisible wall.
[88:31.70]I don't know where to go.
[88:32.70]I'm paranoid to do anything.
[88:36.93]I feel like I had the right idea here.
[88:42.11]It's not from the rail to that to that, is it?
[88:46.66]What about this side?
[88:52.65]It's right here.
[88:55.19]No?
[89:13.99]Oh, how come I didn't grab on the last few times?
[89:26.67]Um... Well, even if I miss, it's fine.
[89:36.14]Oh!
[89:39.76]What?
[89:40.34]I thought that was a scary horror movie sound.
[89:45.14]I don't like this.
[89:50.05]I don't like this.
[89:52.07]Minecraft spawner?
[89:53.41]Yeah.
[89:54.79]I am terrified.
[89:55.77]Risk on.
[90:03.64]Good.
[90:08.64]Okay.
[90:10.88]Now what?
[90:17.78]This way over here.
[90:24.86]Off the tractor.
[90:25.42]Yep.
[90:35.31]Alright, looks like there's a couple ways to go.
[90:38.93]I can go over there, to the right, and up.
[90:41.51]Let's get a good look.
[90:48.99]Yeah, no, okay.
[90:50.05]This is right.
[90:51.71]It's really stupid for me to jump from here to there to save what amounts to four seconds.
[90:56.74]My brain is trying to tell me to hurry the fuck up and go over there and do it.
[91:01.90]No.
[91:02.38]Risk off.
[91:04.34]You need to know when to turn it on and when to turn it off.
[91:09.87]Should I get to the cheese?
[91:10.51]What do you think?
[91:21.55]No.
[91:27.57]How do you go from... Where do you go from the cheese?
[91:30.90]What is on the cheese right now, actually?
[91:33.92]What is that?
[91:35.84]I don't see any... Wait.
[91:36.98]Up there.
[91:40.08]Is it a bed?
[91:42.62]So that's harder, but it's essentially a shortcut.
[91:45.53]Okay.
[91:51.68]I don't know.
[91:52.10]Uh-uh.
[91:53.36]I'm way too far.
[91:54.78]No.
[91:55.08]Risk off.
[91:57.28]Risk off.
[91:57.66]Sorry.
[92:01.00]Not worth it.
[92:06.92]It's... No.
[92:24.27]How do I... I think I have to do... No, I don't.
[92:32.45]I thought I had to do the cheese.
[92:41.90]I feel safe moving pretty quickly up here just because if I fall, it doesn't matter.
[92:44.30]I'm going to land right here.
[92:53.94]Alright.
[92:57.03]Where the hell am I?
[93:24.53]This is not connected to anything.
[93:28.68]Don't I?
[93:29.10]It's a strange feeling.
[93:30.52]I've never been this far away from home.
[93:34.70]Chris gone?
[93:39.80]Okay.
[93:47.86]Oh, yes.
[93:49.14]My Undertaker.
[93:51.47]Destroy him.
[93:53.71]Oh,
[93:56.72]I didn't know that happened.
[93:57.94]It's a good thing I fucking jumped.
[93:59.62]Holy shit.
[94:00.95]It's a good thing I jumped when I did because I would have just lost.
[94:04.75]Wowee.
[94:07.19]Wow.
[94:08.43]That was horrifying.
[94:13.42]Okay.
[94:14.82]I've gotten kind of lucky the last couple of big jumps.
[94:22.60]Alright, where am I going from here?
[94:23.98]Can I- I can fall through this shit.
[94:26.98]This is not gonna be fun.
[94:39.83]Can I fall through this?
[94:45.08]I guess I can't?
[94:47.27]It looks like I can go right through here, but I'm not falling right now.
[94:52.11]Why am I not falling through this?
[94:53.75]You cannot.
[94:54.31]Okay.
[94:55.97]I hope you're not lying to me.
[94:56.83]This is like an hour and four- This is an hour and ten minutes of progress.
[95:00.86]Please don't lie to me.
[95:06.86]Oh, shit.
[95:17.46]Okay, where is this one gonna go?
[95:21.68]Oh.
[95:21.96]My.
[95:23.54]God.
[95:23.88]I had to release some fucking gas right there.
[95:42.61]Okay, everything's fine.
[96:01.95]I think I'm getting, I might be getting kind of close to being in a position where I might be able to finish this video game in like another hour.
[96:09.77]If I do good, just don't make any mistakes.
[96:12.05]Let me be the first streamer on Twitch to fall like once, really, and beat the game in like three tries.
[96:20.22]Let's go for it.
[96:21.02]You know what I'm saying?
[96:21.70]Let me get like an accolade for once in the last like three or four years.
[96:37.14]A bug just got on me.
[96:38.24]A bug is on me.
[96:39.54]Spider, it's a huge one.
[96:50.30]Okay, these don't be stupid.
[96:56.19]Jesus Christ!
[96:58.07]Oh!
[96:59.51]Oh, no, no, no!
[97:00.50]My accolade!
[97:01.40]My accolade!
[97:02.44]My accolade!
[97:03.54]No, I need my accolade!
[97:05.26]Oh, no!
[97:06.72]Oh, big mistakes.
[97:07.84]This is bad.
[97:08.50]My accolade!
[97:09.98]I was...
[97:21.63]Holy shit!
[97:22.99]No!
[97:23.45]I just... I risked on and I wouldn't risk off and I was stuck.
[97:28.41]I couldn't walk forward.
[97:29.49]The cones... The cones have collision that are a full fucking rectangle around them and I thought I was stuck and I freaked out.
[97:42.96]I couldn't walk.
[97:44.36]There was two cones and they had a gigantic collision in front of them.
[97:47.38]I thought I was gonna slip off.
[97:55.58]Risk on for the rest of the fucking stream.
[97:59.12]I was doing so good, too.
[98:00.40]It's just like... Look at this.
[98:03.02]I'm back at the fucking rollercoaster segment.
[98:06.34]I didn't do it on purpose.
[98:07.61]I thought I landed on it, but... God fucking damn it.
[98:22.39]I thought I screwed it up.
[98:24.39]When I slipped back that time, I thought I was going to keep going.
[98:27.87]I was like, fuck, I'm going to jump on the bed and just go for it.
[98:31.43]This is 25 minutes into the stream.
[98:32.59]Don't worry.
[98:32.97]I'll get back there in 10 minutes.
[98:34.01]Time it.
[98:35.15]Watch this.
[98:35.39]I'm just going to zone out and fucking risk on.
[98:40.22]I'll get back there in 10 minutes.
[98:41.00]I'm going to risk on.
[98:42.08]Big time.
[98:43.82]You don't even know.
[98:44.68]You better believe that this is going full risk on right now.
[98:49.46]And I'm going to get to the top in 10 minutes.
[99:00.14]I'm not fucking around.
[99:00.72]Here we go.
[99:05.00]Do it to the supermarket sweep music.
[99:06.68]It's a good idea.
[99:14.34]Supermarket sweep OST.
[99:18.00]That doesn't come up with anything.
[100:00.89]No, I'm not ready yet.
[100:02.85]We're not ready yet.
[100:08.80]Settings.
[100:10.42]Loop.
[100:11.66]How do I loop it?
[100:21.64]Right click it.
[100:22.10]Okay.
[100:36.13]Will he reach the crane again by 745?
[100:37.73]You had better vote yes.
[100:40.29]What do you think about urinal cakes?
[100:44.26]They smell.
[102:42.81]Ha ha!
[106:27.01]Where the fuck am I?
[106:37.06]Where am I?
[107:05.96]So I think what I... What I have to do is just go, risk on, keep the risk on, and just go.
[107:19.84]I'm sweating.
[107:36.62]What the hell are you doing?
[109:35.85]I just had to go because like that's the hardest jump and I was like I just I didn't realize I was still holding shift
[109:43.65]I was still holding shift and I didn't realize it was still holding it.
[109:54.62]It was just my finger was still on it.
[109:57.50]I was good.
[109:58.60]I threw so hard.
[110:01.54]I don't want to hear anything from this person.
[110:03.26]Don't be afraid.
[110:04.80]You can always repeat.
[110:05.85]We learn from our mistakes.
[110:07.29]Oh, my accolades.
[110:10.63]Oh, that's sad.
[110:15.47]That jump is not shift.
[110:17.39]The one before it can be.
[110:21.61]I'm so sad.
[110:22.99]I'm so mad.
[110:23.91]My accolades.
[110:27.82]No, my accolades.
[110:30.60]I can get back there.
[110:32.24]Let me get back there.
[110:33.10]I just didn't even get to the balloons.
[110:34.40]Why are the stupid crane?
[110:36.10]That crane part, I'm fucking furious at.
[110:44.61]Don't let Captain Crunch win.
[110:46.27]Yeah, he's cracking up right now.
[110:50.59]Fuck.
[110:51.31]Okay, I... Fuck.
[110:58.68]Okay.
[111:00.36]Get it out.
[111:03.00]There's still three minutes left?
[111:06.34]Yeah, my problem was... That's a regular running jump.
[111:13.51]Fucked it up.
[111:16.55]Sometimes it's hard to choose the right path, but don't be afraid.
[111:21.77]You can always repeat.
[111:22.95]We learn from our mistakes.
[111:42.23]See that save right there?
[111:43.31]That's from experience.
[111:45.27]That's from playing this game for an hour and having experience.
[111:58.67]Shut up.
[112:03.93]Okay.
[112:05.35]Oh, some of those jumps were so hard, too, and I was nailing them.
[112:09.83]I was nailing some of those.
[112:11.74]You know what I mean?
[112:12.50]Like, you were watching, you were like, holy shit, he's kind of nailing this on the second time he's ever seen it.
[112:18.00]Oh, he's nailing it.
[112:21.93]Any other, like, game show music to fucking get me pumped up?
[112:26.79]I gotta have, like, game show theme songs.
[112:43.10]That's a good one.
[112:48.12]Family Feud theme?
[112:50.98]That one's kind of like goofy though, isn't it?
[112:54.04]It's like... It's like circus music, isn't it?
[112:56.14]This is too goofy!
[113:14.30]American Bible challenge.
[113:15.68]Yep.
[113:18.62]Absolutely.

[114:01.52]We need something else.
[114:03.27]We need something else.
[114:04.07]This is not going to be okay.
[114:07.13]We'll go back to Family Feud.
[114:08.59]Whatever.
[114:08.99]It's not like I'm going to get back to where I was.
[114:13.06]I don't need to loop it.
[114:14.46]It's already an hour long video.
[114:26.14]no guys why would I listen to this version when I can listen to this one here comes the music
[115:03.70]This is fucking good.
[115:04.72]Holy shit, this is great.

[115:41.01]This is actually fucking great.
[115:58.60]Why did I look at chat?
[116:03.68]That was awesome.
[116:04.56]Alright, what else?
[116:05.70]I need something that I can just put back here.
[116:12.75]Who wants to be a millionaire?

[117:15.57]Come on.
[117:16.41]What's going on?
[117:28.37]Why is it so low?
[117:38.42]The beginning is really quiet?
[117:40.40]Oh, I should probably turn it down then.
[118:05.52]Nah, I don't care anymore.
[118:06.34]It was fun for like five seconds.
[118:08.18]Um, I need like something catchy.
[118:12.08]Something that can sit in the background.
[118:18.91]Oprah's theme?

[120:43.66]Risk on.
[121:10.98]I gotta ride the rollercoaster though, we can't even get hyped up yet.
[121:24.03]I'm saving this because we have to ride the rollercoaster and I- Just give it a minute.
[121:31.87]Just give it a minute.
[121:38.96]Why are these games have to be so addicting?
[121:44.46]These games with total, complete failure, they have to be so addicting.
[121:48.92]And it's like, what the heck?
[121:59.45]Okay, so what keeps happening here?
[122:04.47]I've been standing in the same spot each time.
[122:06.07]It's right here.
[122:07.65]This just kind of goes completely off-rails.
[122:13.78]Better.
[122:15.65]The game's bugged.
[122:16.63]The game's bugged.
[122:18.53]The game is bugged.
[122:22.11]There's a bug.
[122:24.85]Am I going to have to walk the train track?
[122:33.58]Walk the tracks.
[122:35.40]Dude, that sucks.
[122:37.72]I guess I could.
[122:38.26]It's not a problem.
[122:42.49]Some of those jumps are going to be hard without the... Without the train.
[122:47.93]Aren't they?
[122:52.63]On camera, what are you doing?
[123:24.98]Music on?
[123:25.56]Not yet.
[123:26.82]I gotta get to a spot where I'm comfortable.
[123:37.27]Why am I doing this?
[123:38.51]Because the cart is bugged and keeps kicking me off.
[123:53.84]I can be... I am my own cart right now.
[123:55.86]Alright, here we are.
[124:19.56]I just smashed a big peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

[125:05.29]Oh my god, my hair just... Dude, I... And that's not where I want to be, man.
[125:21.12]If this bugs out again, then I'm just going to reset the game.
[125:24.77]Accolades.
[125:25.73]My accolades.
[125:28.30]Don't give them to me.
[125:34.13]Okay.
[125:37.01]So is there something in the road?
[125:38.87]I've done this.
[125:39.77]I've ridden this thing like five to ten times already.
[125:42.81]And I never get like launched out.
[125:46.57]That is a bug in the game.
[125:49.54]And it needs to be fixed.
[125:55.56]Whenever the developer has time.
[125:58.25]You know?
[125:59.57]Making a game.
[126:00.75]Patching a game.
[126:01.33]It's a whole operation.
[126:04.17]A lot goes into it.
[126:04.85]A lot of code and shit.
[126:18.32]Why do I look like Jesus?

[131:16.67]Sorry, I, uh... I need a new song.
[131:31.66]That got me up here.
[131:34.24]We need something better than that to get me to where we just were.
[131:37.10]I need something better than that.
[131:44.12]Gonna be hard, though.
[131:55.73]Pizza Tower would be pretty good here, but I feel like we overuse it.
[131:58.43]Alright, we'll do the... What's the one that goes like... That's Game of the Year, by the way.
[132:05.94]Unless Final Fantasy XVI is, like, better.

[132:52.11]I'm not gonna miss a single jump.
[132:56.49]This is where it counts.
[132:57.15]This part is fucking hard.
[135:25.51]Risk on!
[135:58.14]Oh, I just stepped in dog shit.
[136:03.74]Oh, fuck!
[136:09.21]Uh-oh, this music's changing.
[136:15.69]I need something better than that.
[136:21.55]This is not bad either.
[136:25.01]Do lap two music?
[136:29.95]I'm not doing Fall Guys.
[136:31.39]Ooh, yeah, the Sands theme song.

[136:44.04]That might be too... That might be too much.
[136:56.52]City Escape.
[137:00.06]I feel like that one's going to fuck me up, but I'll do it.
[137:07.08]That's going to screw it up, but look.
[137:10.62]We're going to be fine.
[137:25.53]I want to see bat chests only.

[138:49.53]I'm not in it anymore.
[139:03.27]Alright, important right here.
[139:13.19]Can I turn it up?
[139:14.29]I'll turn it up.
[139:15.39]Louder.
[139:22.52]Okay.
[139:31.43]Uh-oh.
[140:11.10]What the hell?
[140:12.52]I'm stuck.
[140:13.44]I'll make it through.
[140:52.92]I got stuck on something!
[140:55.14]What did I get stuck on?
[140:56.28]Did you see my character was like... I got fucking trapped on something.
[141:01.22]What was that?
[141:07.95]My character didn't even jump, he just went... Fucking god damn it!
[141:17.31]Where do I go from here?
[141:18.19]I'm... It's... We're fine.
[141:19.47]This is not that far.
[141:24.17]What the hell am I?
[141:27.11]This goofy-ass music now.
[141:29.87]This is Mario Brothers.
[141:31.14]This is not goofy-ass music.
[141:35.74]It's a little goofy, okay?
[141:38.44]What's going on with my voice today?
[141:43.74]That's a little goofy.
[141:47.38]How do I get it?
[141:49.14]Shut this off.
[141:53.67]My character, I was running for the jump and he just went like... He just like froze.
[142:03.61]How do I get back over there?
[142:05.67]To the left?
[142:08.06]I can't make this jump.
[142:10.64]There you mean?
[142:11.48]Like over there?
[142:12.20]Fuck.
[142:14.00]Oh no.
[142:17.42]You only get one of those this year?
[142:38.14]This is not that bad.
[142:39.12]I got stuck.
[142:41.68]Oh, I would be so much more angry at that if it wasn't really funny.
[142:54.36]That was like the 11th one you've done this year.
[142:56.17]Well, a year is a long time.
[143:07.97]I got this completely done at this point.
[143:10.15]That was so stupid.
[143:15.46]Yeah, we're going musicless for right now.
[143:17.06]Let me just get back to where I was.
[143:27.39]Why don't I just skip this whole thing?
[143:28.73]I mean, that was what I did last time.
[143:30.77]Let's do it again.
[143:42.30]The music helps you, though.
[143:46.08]How about this goofy-ass music back on?
[143:59.23]Oh, no.
[143:59.53]That's it.
[144:04.87]That jump is the worst.
[144:06.41]Because... No.
[144:07.26]Turn it off.
[144:09.56]How about...
[144:16.27]I love Super Mario.
[144:17.67]I grew up with this game.
[144:19.11]Don't forget that.
[144:21.19]I grew up playing Super Mario World.
[144:23.49]It was like the game.
[144:25.33]Super Mario World was the Fortnite when I was like fucking 10.
[144:28.87]Come on.
[144:30.98]This is my Fortnite here.
[144:32.72]Don't you tell me what my Fortnite is and isn't.
[144:42.14]Was this back in the 40s?
[144:47.72]Chrono Trigger battle music.
[145:00.31]That's not the one I want.
[145:01.93]I want the original.
[145:02.89]I want the original.
[145:18.92]Where's the original?
[145:32.77]Okay, I'm going to add that to my likes on YouTube.
[145:35.43]I'll listen to that one like 5,000 to 10,000 times later tonight.
[145:40.09]Where's the original one?
[145:51.82]These are all like the remake and the remaster.
[146:05.28]I mean, I've got a way better one.
[146:08.45]This is, I'm not going to say what this is, but this is a good one.
[146:15.87]People are going to say in Chrono Trigger spoilers.
[146:19.33]So just fucking relax, okay?
[146:21.41]Be careful in the chat.
[146:22.55]Because when I play this, this one is a banger.
[146:25.65]This is an absolute banger.
[146:26.71]You can bad chest me, that's fine.
[146:28.07]But this is one of the final themes of the game.
[146:31.03]Here it comes.
[146:32.27]And it's going to get me to the top.
[146:33.45]This shit's going to get me to the fucking top of this game.
[146:42.94]It's not the right one.
[146:45.73]Wait.
[146:46.37]No, it is.
[146:46.81]It is.
[146:47.07]It is.
[146:47.29]It is.
[146:47.53]No, it is.
[146:49.57]Let's go.
[146:49.95]Let's go.
[147:20.76]Oh, freaking Chrono Trigger!
[147:57.49]This is wrong.
[148:05.71]Here's the right one.
[148:18.35]It's gonna get loud.
[148:48.63]This sounds like a four minute intro.
[148:52.45]Hold on a second.
[148:55.66]How long is this part?
[149:09.68]Let's go.
[149:15.06]Now.
[149:17.82]I gotta get out of this fucking industrial area.
[149:33.17]It's gonna get loud.
[150:11.43]Oh, don't look at chat.
[150:12.50]Don't look at them.
[150:42.23]I just, I just ran into the collision?
[150:44.98]What the fuck?
[150:51.10]Can I even save this?
[150:52.18]I was running, running to jump.
[151:08.51]And then fall.
[151:33.82]Why is this a slowed down version of the song I was just listening to?
[151:36.74]Like, it's mocking me.
[151:40.26]Use the elevator?
[151:43.58]I don't think the elevator works.
[151:44.92]I didn't make a mistake.
[152:01.90]I didn't make a mistake.
[152:02.90]Clip it.
[152:05.20]Clip it.
[152:12.89]You fell on purpose?
[152:13.75]No.
[152:15.35]I went to run on the barrel, and I've done that jump like four times.
[152:19.57]This time, I apparently was hitting a weird collision part-part of the barrel, and I Super Mario mid-animation got stuck and then fell.
[152:27.70]He's actually angry.
[152:44.52]I got it out of my system.
[152:51.29]I'm going again.
[152:58.89]This doesn't do anything, though.
[153:02.09]Alright, this time, we're going to slow it down.
[153:03.73]We're going to play, like, fucking piano.
[153:05.60]Like, royalty-free piano.
[153:07.38]And I'm going to go slow.
[153:31.29]Use night mode?
[153:32.19]It says soon.
[153:33.61]Should I just go get water and put tears coming down my eyes?
[153:41.12]Just have a cry face for like 30 minutes?
[153:42.92]Hold on.
[153:49.34]Should I say like watching like a sad movie on my other monitor?
[153:51.91]Hold on a minute.
[154:07.34]Watching Titanic on other monitors.
[154:20.08]I'll just glance over here all the time and just be like, this needs to be a little bigger.
[154:32.57]Give me one second.
[154:34.57]I'm going to pee.
[156:56.68]I'm back.
[156:57.78]Okay.
[156:59.53]So let's do this.
[157:11.47]Can you like, can you see if I do this?
[157:22.84]Can you see it?
[157:33.70]You can't see it?
[157:34.30]Hold on.
[157:34.86]I'll turn the light on.
[157:35.58]Give me a sec.
[157:42.30]I'm not going to pour it on my face.
[157:43.68]Okay, you should be able to see a little bit better now.
[158:11.82]Hold on just wait Is that you can see better now right so if I go like this is that showing up better I
[158:39.77]Kinda.
[158:51.92]Fuck.
[158:52.72]How can- I can't see it.
[158:55.98]You need to look wet.
[158:58.20]You just look wet.
[159:00.32]I just look like I'm covered in fucking water.
[159:05.81]Just stick your whole head in the fa- No!
[159:09.69]Hold on.
[159:16.00]You just look sweaty.
[159:16.92]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[159:59.98]Oh my god.
[160:07.38]I'm sorry guys, I'm... I've never seen this fucking movie before.
[160:15.45]Oh.
[160:29.91]Fucking awful.
[160:30.85]I'm turning this off.
[160:32.89]I'm turning this off.
[160:34.61]Why would I... This is awful.
[160:36.41]This is the worst fucking thing I've ever done.
[160:38.95]This is not funny.
[160:40.71]I'm just wet.
[160:42.23]I'm just wet.
[160:43.22]I've just... It's like I got hit in the face with a water balloon.
[160:47.52]I need red eyes.
[160:48.72]I'm just wicked sweaty.
[160:55.90]Oh, yeah.
[160:56.38]I've never seen this movie before.
[160:58.04]I'm like really sweating.
[161:01.22]actually kind of felt good I can't even listen to this song anymore let me turn hold on you need no I'm fucking done I'm playing the game now why would you even stream at that point did I tell you guys my bit that I wanted to do so bad
[161:29.45]It was to do, you know, whatever, steal it, whoever.
[161:32.42]It's just, I get 5% royalties.
[161:36.10]I want to do full cam react to a movie that's not happening.
[161:40.04]And it's like an hour and 35 minutes of me sitting there reacting to, like, the Mario movie.
[161:45.80]But it's, I'm not actually watching it.
[161:47.48]And you, like, we're going to watch it together.
[161:51.70]I want 10% royalties if you do that.
[161:57.78]Just sit there and I'll be reacting to shit like, oh, dude, Toad.
[162:00.74]What the fuck is Toad doing?
[162:02.16]Toad might not even be on the screen.
[162:03.94]He might not even be on camera.
[162:06.78]And I sit there for an hour and 30 minutes and pretend like we're doing a watch along of the Mario movie.
[162:14.83]That's pretty good, right?
[162:19.87]Or make it generic.
[162:22.03]We're going to do a watch along.
[162:23.89]I can imagine like, hey.
[162:27.15]Hey everybody, today we're doing a watch along of whatever movie you're watching, whatever movie you care about.
[162:34.31]So right now, we can queue it up if we want to start.
[162:37.92]It doesn't matter what movie you're watching, you and I are watching it together.
[162:41.44]And 3, 2, 1, it doesn't matter what movie you're watching, I just sit there for an hour and 40 minutes and I fake watch a movie.
[162:47.54]And queue it up with everything and anything.
[162:50.29]Queue it up with the Smurfs movie for all I care.
[162:56.74]Get up and go to the bathroom and come back 30 minutes later.
[163:05.75]I don't get it.
[163:06.77]Neither do I, but I think it's funny.
[163:10.39]Okay, would you guys play along?
[163:12.09]If I did that on stream, why would it be a stream?
[163:14.29]I would just upload this video.
[163:16.17]I would just give it to you guys.
[163:18.61]And you just put it on anything.
[163:20.50]I don't care.
[163:24.32]You'd play along?
[163:26.38]Why does this camera look brighter?
[163:28.74]Alright, alright, alright.
[163:29.38]I'm going to give one more attempt.
[163:30.64]I said I was only going to stream for like three hours today.
[163:33.44]So, let's get back to it.
[163:37.30]I would, I would.
[163:42.12]The edits of that to various scenes would be fucking gold.
[163:45.45]I think it would be really funny.
[163:52.09]I'm getting booed.
[163:54.31]Three hour stream?
[163:54.89]Yeah, three hour stream.
[163:59.10]Your light is on?
[164:00.76]Oh, it's on.
[164:01.20]No, it's off.
[164:02.02]I think I just color corrected the camera.
[164:03.98]Alright, let me... I'm not messing around.
[164:06.91]Let's actually go for it.
[164:07.99]I'm going to try to win.
[164:08.85]I'm going to try to actually do it.
[164:14.56]Peewee dance, liar.
[164:17.86]Go back in front of the green screen?
[164:19.40]Okay, what if I go back in front of the green screen and just sit facing a movie theater?
[164:25.27]As if I'm facing the projectors behind me and I'm sitting there.
[164:28.85]And I just keep looking back and keep talking to you and stuff.
[164:30.97]Like you're sitting next to me.
[164:33.39]Or sitting behind me.
[164:36.59]And not like MST3K.
[164:38.93]More like I'm just your annoying friend.
[164:43.08]And I'm just reacting to the movie that I don't know what it is.
[164:51.98]Okay.
[164:59.78]Alright.
[165:00.06]Just public domain.
[165:01.72]Here's the thing, though.
[165:04.89]That's a galaxy brain idea.
[165:06.37]You would crack up in five minutes.
[165:07.63]No, I would be dedicated to it.
[165:11.07]It would have to be exactly... Or, how about this?
[165:14.51]I got an even better idea.
[165:17.39]I react to a movie that you do not know.
[165:22.03]And you have to figure out what movie I'm actually reacting to.
[165:27.33]And I don't give you very many hints.
[165:32.96]I think that's kind of fun too.
[165:34.76]How come this guy talks so much?
[165:37.06]Um... It's my... One of my only skills.
[165:51.35]It's talking well.
[165:52.79]And sometimes I don't even do that very good.
[165:58.27]Bro, this is what?
[166:01.99]I'm good.
[166:02.67]I'm good.
[166:03.19]I've got plenty of skills.
[166:04.09]Don't worry.
[166:06.15]I could do it more than once.
[166:09.35]Who cares?
[166:12.34]I also have that video that I'm working on.
[166:14.58]I'm just going to premiere it on stream.
[166:17.94]I might not even upload it anywhere.
[166:20.84]Imagine him reacting as if it's the Mario movie and someone puts it over Saw.
[166:25.12]Well, here's the thing.
[166:27.06]It would have to just be for fun only because you guys wouldn't be able to upload it anywhere.
[166:33.22]That's like, you know, copyright infringement DMCA shit.
[166:37.83]You can't just upload an entire movie with me in the corner.
[166:41.17]That's just not how that works.
[166:42.85]So, I mean, maybe just for fun for you just to kind of put on whatever.
[166:45.89]I don't know.
[166:49.19]Dude, it didn't even be Yahoo yet.
[166:53.97]The Truman cut?
[166:54.99]Well, the Truman show cut was essentially, I was in every scene replacing actors and stuff.
[167:01.04]This would just be me in the corner watching the movie.
[167:05.00]You can't do that on any platform.
[167:08.18]You can't do that.
[167:12.91]What about the peewee promise?
[167:14.19]Alright, I'm going to play the game now.
[167:16.71]I'm going to go one or two more solid tries and then we'll call it there.
[167:20.59]Short stream today.
[167:21.71]Short stream.
[167:29.23]He loves lying.
[167:30.79]I don't love lying.
[167:31.75]I love making up shit.
[167:35.62]That's lying.
[167:36.18]Is coming up with weird ideas lying?
[167:39.64]By its very nature, it's like making up shit.
[167:46.86]I like to make up scenarios.
[167:48.25]I like to make up stuff.
[167:49.17]Make up, like, stories and characters and stuff.
[167:51.63]I am a... Am I just a liar by trade?
[167:54.17]That's just a... Is that a... No, that's a story.
[167:58.25]I'm not a liar, I'm a storyteller.
[168:07.83]This part of the movie is so sad.
[168:15.18]I'm not lying, I'm just making shit up.
[168:21.14]Alright, last try.
[168:25.23]Both headphones going in.
[168:26.97]Nice piano music.
[168:28.40]No copyright, except the whole stream is coming down anyways because the whole stream has been copyright music, but whatever.
[168:33.66]This one's nice.
[168:43.87]You sound like a super villain.
[168:47.09]I'm just a guy.
[168:47.91]I'm just a guy.
[168:57.59]Stop jumping up and down on the same wall over and over again.
[169:00.93]Play the game.
[169:02.26]Play the game.
[169:16.45]Oh, that is the right way.
[169:17.27]He's just a silly little guy.
[169:30.99]You have a terrible attention span.
[169:33.17]You don't have the attention span of a... This is actually kind of intense.
[169:41.89]I don't have the attention span of a regular guy.
[169:44.35]I'm just a regular guy.
[169:48.61]How do I fix hip pain?
[169:53.82]I don't know.
[169:56.86]A lot of my pain problems are up here.
[169:59.28]And like the sternum.
[170:01.22]I would go to a doctor.
[170:01.92]I don't have very much I can tell you, sorry.
[170:05.46]Unfortunately.
[170:13.37]Your heart?
[170:14.55]Uh... No, it's more sternum.
[170:18.07]I had my heart checked and it was fine.
[170:19.53]But I... Dude, I had every... Every single system in my whole body was checked.
[170:27.61]When I took that break in 2020.
[170:31.63]Oh, I was like, what is going on?
[170:40.38]Competing.
[170:41.02]Alright.
[170:50.85]I'm going to try to keep a straight face while I do this, but it's going to be really difficult.
[170:59.28]I'm putting on three or four different piano royalty free tracks.
[171:02.38]They're just going to be competing.
[171:08.46]Imagine being at a bar or like a club or something and like a lounge.
[171:14.06]This is like three people on pianos.
[171:15.88]By the way, can we talk about this for one second?
[171:18.06]I know I'm supposed to be playing the game, but who cares?
[171:22.30]Did we already talk about why the fuck would you have a big grand piano in your house?
[171:28.99]You know, like, oh, well, I have a big piano.
[171:31.21]Did we already talk about this?
[171:33.97]Did we do that?
[171:34.39]Did I talk about pianos yet?
[171:43.35]No.
[171:43.55]Okay.
[171:44.23]Alright.
[171:44.75]So when you have a house, like, let's say you buy a house.
[171:48.43]It's like, oh, yeah, I got a house now.
[171:49.59]Okay.
[171:49.95]Yeah, I got a house.
[171:51.35]You know what I really, really want in a room in the house?
[171:54.15]Just a giant fucking piano.
[171:58.10]But if you don't play it.
[171:59.16]I don't know how many people play those pianos.
[172:02.99]Like, oh, the paint on the wall.
[172:05.17]Maybe I'll change the floors.
[172:06.91]Maybe I'll redesign one of the rooms.
[172:09.37]Grand piano.
[172:13.07]If you don't play.
[172:15.39]If you're not a pianist.
[172:19.63]They take up an entire... They take up a huge amount of square footage in a house.
[172:27.15]A pianist.
[172:28.65]You immature little bastards.
[172:31.39]Alright, let's go.
[172:40.32]It's a pianist.
[172:43.34]I'm not saying it again.
[172:47.54]But I've never once in my whole life been like, you know, I really think I want a big grand piano in that room.
[172:58.67]I forget how to play the game.
[173:00.06]Everyone stop.
[173:22.42]Alright.
[173:23.32]Can I do my stupid little routine now?
[173:28.23]I like your Batman hair.
[173:37.87]Ludwig beat this game?
[173:40.27]Ludwig beat this game?
[173:41.59]How long did it take Ludwig to beat this?
[173:48.30]How long did it take Ludwig to do this?
[173:51.76]Nine hours?
[173:53.08]Eight hours?
[173:57.19]What the fuck?
[173:58.41]How?
[174:03.39]Did Ster beat this?
[174:09.65]Oh, the piano songs.
[174:10.39]Alright, here we go.
[174:11.39]This is going to be unbearable.
[174:13.01]This is just one of those streams.
[174:14.69]Did Vinny beat it too?
[174:16.27]Who did?
[174:16.83]Whatever.
[174:17.09]Alright, this is going to be awful, but I don't care.
[174:22.30]I'm just imagining like three people and different pianos all trying to play different music over each other.
[174:28.26]Alright, we'll see if this is funny.
[174:31.52]This one's called soft piano music.
[174:35.04]Alright, let's try it.
[174:36.09]Here we go.
[174:37.29]No laughing, straight face only.
[174:55.25]So,
[175:23.10]This is just what it was like inside of every Radio Shack in America.
[175:28.15]Every single Radio Shack in America sounded like this.
[175:31.95]Every one of them.
[175:36.19]It's just people playing keyboards in every aisle.
[176:03.60]can do it anymore.
[176:04.11]We're going to leave one of them on.
[176:09.81]More?
[176:11.61]More pianos?
[176:12.69]You're going to crash my computer.
[176:32.57]Why is my... My computer's hanging right now.
[176:35.96]Alright, once I have eight open, I'm done. ...
[177:09.29]This sounds like someone's just shit-faced playing the piano.
[177:11.87]Like they're good, but they've had like eight cocktails.
[177:28.07]Okay, last one.
[177:34.47]I can't do more than this.
[177:49.71]This is fucked.
[177:59.51]This is like when an orchestra is about to start actually playing a song.
[178:04.08]They all like play at the same time.
[178:07.68]And then it's like it kind of sounds fucking weird and then they stop.
[178:13.50]Alright, that's enough.
[178:14.16]I'm going.
[178:18.08]No emotion.
[178:20.66]Add a cheering soundtrack too?
[178:30.55]Like, it's like a stadium cheering sounds.
[178:38.15]One hour.
[179:13.72]I forgot where to go.
[179:14.36]Alright.
[179:25.59]Add car driving sounds.
[179:27.19]Wait, it's picking up.
[179:51.37]I've heard this one before.
[179:52.73]One of them.
[180:00.66]It's Club Penguin.
[180:04.84]It's Club Penguin.
[180:05.82]That's what it is.
[180:06.42]I feel like I'm going to have a nightmare later tonight.
[180:41.83]They're not happy anymore.
[180:43.62]They're not happy.
[180:45.60]Oh shit, then they're very unhappy.
[180:47.58]Oh
[181:13.40]I keep closing tabs and it's still going.
[181:22.12]You know, I think about like, man, like our youth today, like all these crazy videos and TikTok and all like the brain rot and stuff.
[181:31.06]Look what I just did to all of you.
[181:33.98]You know what I mean?
[181:37.84]Like all the youth today, they're just consuming TikTok videos.
[181:43.20]I'm gonna play ten piano sound effects with cheering and booing and farting and screaming sounds.
[181:48.84]It's me too.
[181:50.84]It's me too.
[181:59.72]I kind of miss it.
[182:08.23]And only a thousand people left.
[182:09.55]That's actually kind of surprising.
[182:14.50]I don't know why I'm going for like a high score.
[182:26.78]Okay.
[182:29.77]Let's try it for real.
[182:31.37]No jokey shit.
[182:32.29]No bullshit.
[182:32.89]I got it.
[182:33.41]Alright.
[182:34.17]Tell me the truth.
[182:34.77]No messing around.
[182:36.67]Did I do a good job?
[182:40.77]As high as I got.
[182:42.41]I got to pretty much where the balloons are.
[182:43.94]Did I do a good job?
[182:44.56]Did I do alright?
[182:45.38]I think I did okay.
[182:47.86]I'm actually surprised I got as high as I did.
[182:54.04]That one crane kind of... When I fell off the crane, all the way up where the balloons are, that's when the pianos were starting to play in my head.
[183:03.60]It was just like, oh shit, it's over.
[183:05.74]But we're good.
[183:06.06]I'm having fun.
[183:11.64]That's like 15% of the way through the game.
[183:16.10]That's true.
[183:17.11]I did say I was going to try to get past 10%.
[183:30.53]Charlie Speed runs this game.
[183:33.54]I want to watch that.
[183:34.56]I feel like that's very interesting to see.
[183:43.64]Put on club.
[183:45.34]Okay, we're good.
[183:52.30]Please, subway surfers, no.
[184:10.66]Charlie's like, is Charlie, is he playing it right now?
[184:20.08]How much further than me is he right now?
[184:32.91]Like 5%.
[184:39.99]Those bits sapped him of all of his energy?
[184:41.87]Yeah, they kind of did.
[184:42.65]Too many funny sound effects.
[184:50.59]Is it your discomfort?
[184:55.79]I just want to... I want to get back up to the... I'm going to try one more time.
[185:04.60]Somebody said, funny in quotes.
[185:08.36]Yeah, I'll allow that.
[185:16.67]I will allow that.
[185:19.49]That doesn't mean I'm going to not...
[185:21.86]No, I'm not going to time you up.
[185:24.77]No, I'm going to be nice today.
[185:32.57]No music.
[185:33.07]I'll turn the actual sounds back up though.
[185:36.05]I think I just fell off.
[185:44.08]Okay.
[185:49.92]Okay, back to normal.
[185:57.58]Jeez.
[186:01.06]This is fun, though.
[186:01.62]See what I mean?
[186:04.44]See what I mean?
[186:06.82]That's happened a few times in a bad spot.
[186:11.36]Risk on?
[186:13.14]Maybe when we get up a little higher.
[186:20.54]Please put public domain movies in the corner.
[186:26.09]Why, so you can go like this on your iPad and just zoom in on that movie and not even watch the stream anymore?
[186:32.57]No, you're... I'm here right now.
[186:45.19]You know what's crazy?
[186:47.51]The part coming up here with all those little jumps, the really, really scary ones, I flawlessly executed, but then I'll just fall off the edge over here.
[187:00.45]Weird.
[187:07.13]Subway servers, please.
[187:10.69]Have a public domain movie instead of a face cam.
[187:14.18]I actually like that idea.
[187:15.04]That's funny.
[187:18.36]That's very humorous.
[187:32.17]Alright.
[187:32.79]If I get across this... Don't go fast.
[187:41.69]This is my last attempt, so do it right.
[187:57.38]Oh, my God, I'm so off.
[188:08.82]I guess with repetition, you kind of just burn into muscle memory how to do all this stuff.
[188:17.22]I do wish I mean, I'm a checkpoint, Andy.
[188:20.53]I like checkpoints.
[188:26.31]It's also possible that I just haven't come across a checkpoint because I haven't gotten far enough.
[188:32.00]That's very possible.
[188:47.13]Oh my goodness.
[188:48.35]I didn't grab onto anything, but I'm still good.
[188:49.89]Alright.
[188:51.79]The worst is here.
[188:54.27]This is like technically one of the worst parts.
[188:57.08]Slow it down and get it right.
[189:09.49]Good.
[189:11.71]Right here.
[189:12.29]Alright.
[189:15.37]Okay.
[189:21.37]This part sucks.
[189:22.88]Every time I get here, I look and I kind of gulp like a cartoon because it's always stressful.
[189:27.14]Because it's very easy to screw this up.
[189:30.32]Did you see the new Spider-Verse?
[189:46.25]I did not.
[189:47.43]I want to, though.
[189:49.87]I want to...
[189:53.38]Alright, careful.
[189:54.30]Get it right.
[189:55.82]I've done this jump like five times now.
[189:57.77]No reason to overthink it.
[190:21.14]This part is the worst because I always feel like I'm not going to make it, but somehow I just do every time.
[190:25.67]It's scary.
[190:31.39]Okay, almost at the industrial area.
[190:41.72]That's the hardest jump of this whole map.
[190:43.54]Actually, it might be this one here.
[190:56.72]Alright.
[190:58.39]I just scared the shit out of somebody, but I scared the shit out of myself.
[191:01.80]So we both got scared.
[191:27.38]OK.
[191:35.23]That one is deceiving because it's really not that it's really not hard.
[191:38.15]It just looks hard.
[191:38.77]Alright, breather.
[191:49.10]Geez, dude, what are you doing?
[192:00.37]Okay, the last couple times, this has been a disaster the last couple times I was here.
[192:06.90]I have progressed like 30 minutes ahead of this.
[192:10.18]For some reason, it's this stupid area right here.
[192:32.32]Okay.
[192:34.76]Up there is what I'm talking about.
[192:37.16]This part's kind of hard too, but just be careful.
[192:39.80]It's not that big of a deal.
[192:47.33]Really not.
[192:56.77]You got further in ten minutes than I did in three hours.
[192:59.97]Well, I've been streaming for three hours.
[193:01.78]And I've been streaming this game for three hours.
[193:04.20]So... We are at the same spot.
[193:10.10]Think about it.
[193:18.25]This is what screwed me up last time.
[193:22.29]And it was fine.
[193:24.11]What happened the last time I got there?
[193:29.01]Honestly, what happened?
[193:46.07]You lagged out.
[193:46.89]Pretty weird.
[193:54.37]Okay.
[193:59.64]I'm almost at the awful jump that screwed me up last time.
[194:03.20]I might not even do it.
[194:04.54]I might just sit.
[194:05.34]If I stay on it, it'll throw me off though, won't it?
[194:11.07]It'll throw me off.
[194:14.71]Don't jump off the platform.
[194:18.11]Won't it toss me?
[194:23.97]It won't?
[194:26.11]I feel like it threw me last time.
[194:28.43]Or am I just crazy?
[194:32.81]It will not toss you.
[194:33.95]You need to jump.
[194:34.83]Well, that's what I tried.
[194:35.45]I tried to jump last time and it just kind of like... Don't jump yet.
[194:50.20]God.
[194:50.60]Okay, well, here we go.
[194:57.51]You've got to be shitting me, thank goodness.
[195:00.25]I hit the wire.
[195:06.53]God damn it.
[195:07.17]I was going to say, I better not be softlocked.
[195:41.48]Okay, we're good.
[195:50.72]We're fine.
[195:52.30]I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it because I didn't think I was good.
[195:55.13]Well, I thought I was good, so we're good.
[196:03.11]This part is freaking me out, though.
[196:04.53]I...
[196:08.30]I've gotten here two or three other times and just fallen off.
[196:14.32]Yeah, you fell off.
[196:15.26]Yeah, I know.
[196:16.48]It's whatever.
[196:17.00]Yeah, you peaked at shpee.
[196:20.03]I know.
[196:21.53]I've heard it all before.
[196:26.73]A little bit of shpee.
[196:29.15]A little bit of shpee.
[196:33.09]That's one of my favorite streams.
[196:35.27]Just because I've said it a million times, but I'm going to reiterate it over and over again.
[196:39.74]It's just like that.
[196:41.24]I say that all the time, right?
[196:42.62]I say that all the time.
[196:45.28]Those actors were given just like a little 20 minute package of things to study.
[196:51.05]And like, ooh, hot cup of cider.
[196:53.31]As if those are my catchphrases.
[196:54.53]Ooh, shpee.
[196:56.49]I mean, I haven't said that in nine years.
[197:00.52]I love that so much.
[197:04.48]They got such a small window of what like I've done in 12 years that like most of it was from like 2012.
[197:14.03]Perfect.
[197:14.41]I love it.
[197:16.61]Okay, here we go.
[197:17.38]Don't hit the wire.
[197:21.44]Alright.
[197:22.06]I'm ready.
[197:22.34]I'm ready.
[197:22.60]I'm ready.
[197:30.51]We're back.
[197:33.85]And another 20 feet or so, and I'm game progress.
[197:46.28]Well, more like 100 feet.
[197:47.44]I got way higher than this last time.
[197:57.63]This is a weird thing.
[197:58.69]Okay.
[198:06.85]I did this.
[198:07.37]This part was a little weird, but I'll be good.
[198:10.55]Just do it slow.
[198:12.09]There's no reason to go, uh, risk on right now.
[198:16.57]Holy shit, I almost didn't get it.
[198:17.89]Okay.
[198:31.90]This is where I failed.
[198:40.88]That's... I know what happened.
[198:42.22]I know what happened.
[198:43.62]Why did I fall?
[198:44.41]I know what happened.
[198:45.31]Those stupid... Oh my god.
[198:47.31]Those little things out of the... That's a kaizo block.
[198:50.95]That's a fucking kaizo block.
[198:53.21]You gotta be fucking shitting me.
[198:55.21]That's a kaizo block.
[198:56.81]There's like a little thing on the ground and it makes you fucking just walk off.
[198:59.82]It's a kaizo block.
[199:05.20]You're gonna be shitting me.
[199:08.97]There is like a little tiny staple on that thing that just pushes you off if you walk into it.
[199:17.32]That's annoying.
[199:18.12]I'm annoyed now.
[199:20.96]I didn't walk off.
[199:22.30]Go clip it.
[199:23.06]Go look at it.
[199:23.94]The thing's collision is as big as like 10 people's feet.
[199:27.70]I'm annoyed now.
[199:30.14]You have to jump over those.
[199:33.08]Or they just push you off.
[199:34.65]And now I know that.
[199:35.87]And I'm pissed.
[199:46.76]Yeah, come on.
[199:49.72]You got like six inches to walk and there's like a little staple sticking out of the ground will push you off the map.
[199:58.57]You have to jump.
[199:59.25]There's three of them.
[200:00.27]I saw them.
[200:00.75]And I even said to myself, I was like, do I?
[200:04.21]Like that thing is like weird and sticking out of the ground.
[200:07.14]And I walked into it in Kaizo Blocked Eye.
[200:28.58]Well, now I know.
[200:29.60]Now I know that the- the little fucking speed bump sticking out of the ground, the- the little, like, it's a little tiny little thing.
[200:40.75]If you touch it, if you walk into it, it's just
[201:02.08]What the fuck?
[201:03.58]I was... And that's what happened last time.
[201:05.60]And I was confused last time, too.
[201:07.14]I was like, why did I fall off?
[201:10.22]Why did my character walk off the edge?
[201:12.74]And now I know a little staple.
[201:15.46]I could repeat myself a hundred times.
[201:22.90]That ain't happening a third time.
[201:24.22]I'm getting up there just to fucking spite this game.
[201:37.71]Walking over a shpee-bump.
[201:42.05]What do I mean, no proof, Andy?
[201:43.75]I didn't walk off of it!
[201:44.99]I literally, it pushed me off of the fucking thing!
[201:48.63]I'm watching it right now.
[201:56.52]I'm telling you right now, why would I walk off the edge like that?
[201:59.86]You've seen me walk on, I just put, I just, my character just fucking went over the edge.
[202:06.62]I promise you.
[202:09.39]There's no reason why I would have done that.
[202:12.49]You've seen me walk on smaller ledges than that.
[202:19.21]Oh hey, I'm at the area that I got to and I was really happy I got back to the area.
[202:23.35]Let me walk off the edge now.
[202:25.43]Let me just walk sideways.
[202:38.70]You should have adjusted.
[202:43.58]I'm gonna... Wait till you play it.
[202:47.21]And you're gonna have the same Larry David response that I had.
[202:49.93]You're gonna go... That streamer's an idiot.
[202:54.39]He doesn't know what he's talking about.
[202:55.19]You're gonna walk right over it.
[202:56.07]And then you're gonna go... And then the fucking music's gonna play.
[203:01.62]And then you're gonna understand.
[203:32.34]That was the best Larry David impression I've ever heard.
[203:35.94]Thank you.
[203:42.92]It wasn't really an impression.
[203:44.44]It was a noise.
[203:46.06]It was a sound effect.
[203:51.77]Oh, and see, it's so hard.
[203:53.69]The little staples sticking out of the ground is what they're... You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[204:03.67]I was at the same exact spot I was three, two hours ago.
[204:08.84]Two hours ago, I was right there.
[204:10.83]I'm furious right now.
[204:13.71]Fucking staple.
[204:36.48]Hey, happy Father's Day to all you fathers.
[204:40.31]If there's any fathers here.
[204:42.95]That includes dog dads, too, by the way.
[204:45.03]That includes dog dads.
[205:01.19]Okay, actually, last attempt.
[205:12.56]I've done this so many times that I can just do it now without a problem.
[205:22.87]No.
[205:39.95]I think I can just make this jump right here.
[205:42.77]See this thing?
[205:49.59]Look at that thing.
[205:51.35]Watch this, buddy.
[206:15.83]I was about to go risk on, but yeah, fuck it.
[206:32.24]Sunk cost fallacy?
[206:36.32]I would agree with you if I didn't get back there a second time.
[206:43.64]Me getting back to that spot a second time means I can get back to it a third time.
[206:48.12]And now I know about the Kaizo block.
[206:53.40]So I'm prepared now.
[207:03.56]This is the hardest part of this area.
[207:06.86]I'm ready to go.
[207:07.58]Ready to rock and roll.
[207:08.40]Just do it.
[207:08.80]I've done it.
[207:09.28]I've not fallen off of this the last four or five times I've been here.
[207:13.91]So just keep at it.
[207:14.91]Keep it going.
[207:31.98]It didn't jump.
[207:33.60]It didn't even... It didn't jump.
[207:35.88]I just like fucking slid off.
[207:37.82]I jumped and he just didn't do it.
[207:42.32]I made that jump five times in a row.
[207:58.01]It's like your feet are their own physics objects.
[208:01.08]Look at this.
[208:02.16]And they like... I didn't fall all the way.
[208:09.10]That means we do it again.
[208:11.32]It's not that far.
[208:30.35]It's not far.
[208:31.55]It's right there.
[208:35.99]The elephant just upset him, you can tell.
[208:45.13]That was my fault too, right?
[208:59.08]I'm fine.
[209:00.12]Put the fucking piano music back on.
[209:02.42]Scream.
[209:06.00]What's a good thing to try one more time?
[209:18.22]SimCity SNES.
[209:19.58]That sounds kind of good.
[209:23.02]How about...
[209:33.20]Bill Collins?
[209:41.33]Final Fantasy battle themes.
[209:44.27]How about the Final Fantasy 16 battle theme?
[209:46.51]That one has been stuck in my head.
[209:50.27]It won't go away.
[209:52.17]It will not go away.
[209:56.36]I can't get rid of it.
[209:57.46]So I'm going to do it now.
[210:01.42]It's great.
[210:02.40]I love it.
[210:06.33]What a fake fan.
[210:08.21]Final Fantasy, I love it!
[210:10.03]Yes!
[210:10.61]I haven't played a Final Fantasy in 20 years.
[210:15.85]Hey, it's really good.
[210:17.15]I really like it.
[210:17.67]I'm looking forward to playing it.
[210:24.45]How could you not like this?
[210:26.72]Yeah, all the Batchesters.
[210:31.10]Yeah.
[210:31.88]Oh, sorry.
[210:32.41]Are you getting a little pumped up right now?
[210:34.69]Is that what's happening?
[210:49.09]I'm going risk on the entire run here.
[210:51.93]I'm not going risk off ever again.
[211:36.87]Somebody's playing the game.
[211:45.70]Oh no no no, that's the industry thing right there.
[211:49.93]I thought somebody recorded the in-game footage.
[213:36.50]Whoa!
[214:51.93]Final Fantasy 16.
[214:54.35]Releasing on June 22nd.
[214:56.83]Oh, it's gone.
[214:57.41]I miss it.
[215:26.74]Final Fantasy VI battle theme?
[216:10.08]Oh, Mario Galaxy is a good one.
[216:11.64]That's a good one.
[216:14.36]I have a major... You want to hear my criticism of the Mario movie?
[216:19.25]Here it is.
[216:19.59]I'm going to give you a three-sentence take.
[216:30.13]The Mario franchise has so many songs that they could remix and stuff.
[216:40.56]But a lot of the musical tracks of that movie are like, take me on.
[216:49.22]Take on me.
[216:54.14]You're watching a movie.
[216:58.00]It's just you're watching a movie.
[216:59.34]You're watching a movie.
[217:00.76]Here's a movie.
[217:01.50]Alright, let me put it on.
[217:13.79]I was waiting for this.
[217:15.83]And it was just like a licensed movie soundtrack stuff.
[217:23.68]Every time it would do a licensed rock song, I'm just like, I'm watching a movie.
[217:27.50]This is a movie.
[217:28.82]Hey, honey.
[217:30.89]Honey, this is a movie.
[217:44.96]Now, I know it's a movie, but it's almost like I'm being reminded that I'm watching a movie.
[217:54.76]This is not the one I want.
[217:56.67]Where's the one?
[217:58.29]You know the one.
[218:00.05]This one.
[218:00.35]I could have just played this for an hour and 40 minutes in the background the whole movie, and I would have been probably happier.
[218:09.53]Don't you think so?
[218:10.23]Like, this could have just been in the background for an hour and 20 minutes.
[218:26.03]Shit, I gotta go.
[218:50.63]Whoo!
[219:11.35]Here it comes here it comes No, not yet
[219:45.65]Also, is it a shit take to say that I don't think Chris Pratt did a bad job?
[219:49.97]Is that a shit take?
[219:53.67]Is that a shit take?
[220:01.77]I was like, I was sitting there being like, I can't, I can't say this sucks.
[220:10.09]It's alright.
[220:10.59]This is okay.
[220:12.76]This is okay.
[220:13.42]This is fine.
[220:14.80]I'm okay with this.
[220:17.26]I'm alright with this.
[220:17.90]It's alright.
[220:19.07]Yeah, this is cool.
[220:23.23]Better than what I expected?
[220:24.13]Yeah.
[220:24.87]I thought it was alright.
[220:26.37]What did you say?
[220:29.47]You've been what?
[220:31.51]You've been extra hairy lately.
[220:34.47]Um... Yeah.
[220:38.37]It's alright.
[220:38.94]Alright, let's put the music back on.
[220:50.68]Alright, now here it comes.
[220:53.94]I think.
[220:57.78]Aren't you doing the be as gross as possible challenge?
[221:05.27]Oh yeah, I forgot about that.
[221:07.89]This is the... Okay, this is the one I'm talking about.
[221:15.07]Yes, it is.
[221:26.66]I'll turn it up for you.
[221:27.27]Alright, I'm turning it up for you guys.
[221:30.89]Let's just vibe out right now.
[221:32.17]What do you say?
[221:35.33]This time, I'm getting there. ...
[222:32.33]Fucking beautiful.
[222:33.99]Why are you not streaming in 1080p?
[222:36.84]Um, my computer sucks.
[222:46.35]I'm on an i3.
[222:47.05]Sorry, sorry.
[222:49.59]Okay.
[223:14.35]Hey buddy!
[223:17.83]We meet again!
[223:24.85]It's a bug! It's a bug! It's a bug!
[223:32.17]It's an actual bug. It's an actual bug.
[223:34.17]It's a bug.
[223:35.19]It's a fucking bug.
[223:37.45]It's a bug.
[223:40.77]It's a bug.
[223:43.50]It's a bug in the game.
[223:45.14]It's a bug.
[223:51.29]It just- it just pushes you off.
[223:53.11]It makes you fall off.
[223:54.37]It's a bug.
[223:56.07]Is it a bug?
[223:56.61]I don't know, dude.
[223:58.19]You've fucked up my whole body arts.
[224:01.55]I can't even walk over here.
[224:02.81]See what I'm talking about?
[224:04.23]It's a bug.
[224:08.06]Do I have to use the bed?
[224:09.26]Is this intended?
[224:13.47]Oh, shit!
[224:22.82]Stop!
[224:24.02]Stop!
[224:26.18]It's... Guys, it's... I didn't do anything.
[224:30.89]This area is fucked up.
[224:33.37]I'm telling you right now, this area is fucked up.
[224:35.93]It wouldn't let me stand on it.
[224:37.21]It was just, like, pushing me off.
[224:45.48]See what I'm saying?
[224:48.22]What's happening here?
[224:52.64]It won't let me land on it.
[224:59.90]You're going the wrong way?
[225:04.16]What do you mean I'm going the wrong way?
[225:05.60]You have to jump to the cement?
[225:11.64]Walks?
[225:14.01]What are you talking about?
[225:14.71]What do you mean?
[225:17.44]You mean up here?
[225:17.94]What do you mean?
[225:20.30]I'm slowly doing a split.
[225:22.40]And this looks very painful.
[225:25.42]The gray things in front of you.
[225:30.50]This is going to start to hurt.
[225:32.14]To the balloons?
[225:32.82]Where are the balloons?
[225:44.16]What do you mean that way?
[225:45.78]I'm so confused and I can't move.
[225:47.40]I'm going to pause it.
[225:50.08]Jump over here?
[225:58.61]Yeah, but I can't travel that far.
[226:04.71]You talking about right here or down?
[226:06.62]No.
[226:07.22]What do you mean?
[226:09.58]You've been going the wrong way.
[226:13.00]Just the rectangles by the, no, down, down, down, down there, down, wait, down here.
[226:17.60]I don't, no, that's where I just was.
[226:22.31]I was just here.
[226:24.83]In this building.
[226:28.29]Wait, what, so this is just bait?
[226:32.62]This was bait?
[226:33.36]What?
[226:42.29]I don't think I can move.
[226:43.35]I'm in the thriller pose.
[226:56.98]Alright.
[226:57.46]Fuck.
[226:58.08]I...
[227:36.13]My balloons!
[227:41.29]Okay, I'm fine.
[227:46.31]Am I alright?
[227:46.87]Yeah.
[227:50.75]I'm fine, everybody relax.
[227:59.88]I'm a tuber tonight, so this is like the most tuber I've been.
[228:05.61]This is probably the most tuber I have been in like probably two or three years.
[228:08.59]Okay.
[228:23.33]I got to get up there and jump off of that.
[228:33.56]What's the best way to get up there?
[228:35.54]Like what I was just doing?
[228:43.40]My balloons!
[229:50.58]I'm gonna get down.
[230:20.54]My balloons!
[230:25.07]What a person really needs is not a state of peace, but the striving and fighting for some worthy goal.
[230:34.71]Fuck all that.
[230:36.65]I don't even know.
[230:37.19]I don't know what they said, but I'm talking about the cinder blocks.
[230:50.13]Risk on.
[230:50.55]I did it.
[231:24.18]I actually didn't go that far.
[231:25.36]I think I can get back up there.
[231:30.19]You jacked too hard.
[231:32.61]I went right in the middle of all of them.
[231:41.45]Shit.
[231:42.87]I'm not upset.
[231:43.81]I'm not that far.
[231:49.09]That's not a reset moment.
[231:51.33]I'm right here.
[231:52.69]This is not that far.
[231:56.51]All the annoying shit is done already.
[232:16.43]This music is the only thing keeping me from screaming as loud as I can.
[232:22.38]just like alright okay little stars flying around and they all go like it's it's cute and okay I'm fine it's cute
[232:52.46]I made it to the balloons.
[232:53.72]I'm happy.
[232:54.68]No matter what happens.
[232:56.70]When I was all the way down there, looking up, I did not think.
[233:02.70]I didn't think I was going to get to the balloons, but I wanted to.
[233:06.75]I'll take that as a win.
[233:10.07]You should stream Mario Galaxy.
[233:11.99]Maybe we will.
[233:12.53]That sounds like fun.
[233:19.58]If I get to the balloons, then I'll be really happy.
[233:21.88]I can actually stand where the balloons are.
[233:23.59]We're already right there.
[233:25.63]We're already back.
[233:27.25]It's like as if I didn't even fall.
[233:38.35]What's up next?
[233:57.17]Ah, there we go.
[234:11.63]How's everybody doing?
[234:13.61]You guys doing alright?
[234:15.05]You guys doing good?
[234:25.80]I didn't ask you that today.
[234:28.46]You doing alright?
[234:32.76]I don't ask you that like, well, maybe like once a year.
[234:34.90]Oh, hey.
[234:42.45]Sunflowers are about to open.
[234:43.57]There'll be an update there soon.
[235:00.03]Alright, let's... I'm pretty much where I was before.
[235:04.85]There's no reason to get angry or annoyed.
[235:07.13]I really haven't even been that angry.
[235:09.85]I got angry at a system that I thought was like kaizo blocking me, but it just... I went the wrong way and I was hitting invisible developer walls.
[235:15.99]So that's my own fault.
[235:30.48]You influenced Vinny to check out this game because you streamed it.
[235:33.52]Didn't Vinny play this already?
[235:37.40]Wait, Vinny played this already, didn't he?
[235:43.96]No, not yet.
[235:44.64]Oh, you all told me he beat it.
[235:46.60]You all told me Vinny beat this.
[235:54.15]Oh, I see what's going on.
[235:55.59]I get it.
[236:00.95]I was explicitly told that Vinny beat the game.
[236:13.57]Always scary grabbing this one.
[236:17.87]I just had to go left.
[236:18.85]That's so funny.
[236:21.55]And I was sitting there just seething and just complaining.
[236:25.97]I just went the wrong way.
[236:36.28]What's the best way to get up from here?
[236:38.40]Wait.
[236:42.54]Do I have to use the bed?
[236:46.41]Is there a way to get- Oh, no, we're here.
[236:58.37]Hey, you tell Vinny- You tell Vinny that Balloon Barry-
[237:05.50]You tell Vinny that Balloon Barry is going for it right now.
[237:10.60]He's going to look up and he's going to go, What?
[237:12.04]And I'm going to look so cool on Vinny's stream for like 10 seconds.
[237:18.10]Tell him it was wicked hard too.
[237:19.39]What?
[238:03.12]Did I go that way?
[238:05.57]If I just launch, I don't think so.
[238:14.23]I'm good.
[238:15.23]Balloon Barry.
[238:17.81]Balloon Barry.
[238:18.67]Get a screenshot.
[238:19.37]Quick.
[238:20.39]Get a screenshot.
[238:22.33]I was going to turn this off.
[238:38.02]You can fall off the... Don't tell Vinny that.
[238:43.78]You can fall off the roof.
[238:44.96]It's slippery.
[238:49.87]That would have sucked so bad.
[238:59.51]Where is this gonna go?
[239:06.01]Was it worth the screenshot?
[239:11.36]Let me look.
[239:11.76]This is going to move.
[239:15.78]Where does it move to?
[239:25.17]Have I just put on the Final Fantasy 16 battle music again?
[239:29.09]Is that weird?
[239:30.10]Do you care?
[239:38.50]Uh, it's gonna go that way or that it's probably gonna go over here.
[240:00.27]I'm going to take my time because stream is getting close to being over.
[240:04.45]I'm either going to beat it or I'm just going to get to wherever I get to on the thermometer going up.
[240:24.06]Soul Calibur?
[240:28.38]Vinny's watching the clip
[240:32.73]It was so stressful.
[240:35.14]Vinny, spoilers.
[240:36.06]Don't... Vinny, spoilers.
[240:43.72]Hmm.
[240:45.20]This is important because this has to keep me going because this is uncharted territory.
[240:48.16]I don't know where I am.
[240:54.33]It's got to be something really good.
[241:00.07]Ooh.
[241:00.49]Ooh.
[241:02.74]Oh my goodness.
[241:06.18]That is true.
[241:07.83]Uh, snake eater.
[241:13.43]The one that goes, it was out of tune, but you know what I mean?
[241:17.84]Remember when you smoked the cigar?
[241:19.56]That's a good one.
[241:21.02]That's a really good one.
[241:32.42]No, that's from 5.
[241:33.04]That's not from 3.
[241:34.40]Let's go.
[242:02.80]But you're so supreme.
[242:04.54]I give my life, not for honor, but for you.
[242:23.32]Something fell.
[242:36.66]Someday you go
[242:57.30]And someday you'll feed on a tree frog It's your dream, the trial to survive For the day we see the light I give my life Not for honor, but for you In my time
[243:32.84]Not gonna fool me with that bullshit.
[244:18.17]That song is great.
[244:23.29]Bloodborne now.
[244:24.35]Bloodborne now.
[244:25.01]Bloodborne now?
[244:28.10]Ludwig's theme?
[244:34.34]Oh yeah.
[244:34.84]I listen to this all the time.
[244:45.55]People are so talented.
[244:46.89]Isn't it interesting?
[244:50.30]It's like, humans are able to create so many things.
[244:54.18]Isn't that cool?
[244:57.32]What we are capable of doing on this fucking planet.
[244:59.70]Alright, this is a stressful part.
[245:10.99]And I'm going to let the, because I usually just skip right to the Ludwig part.
[245:17.42]What do you think?
[245:25.03]Did we listen to the whole thing?
[245:26.03]Okay, let it build, let it build.
[245:27.39]That means I can't fall for six minutes.
[245:30.78]Alright.
[245:31.10]It's gonna get loud.
[246:00.47]Can I stand on that?
[246:03.86]OH MY GOD!
[246:54.07]Oh, yes.
[246:55.97]You were on my side all along.
[247:00.86]My true mentor.
[247:03.02]My guiding moonlight.
[247:06.68]That's not the right part of the track.
[247:10.26]Anything to make you cope with what you're doing.
[247:13.64]I got it wrong.
[247:17.74]There's a little more.
[247:18.60]I jumped the gun a little.
[247:28.54]Oh, my God.
[248:07.61]Jesus!
[248:16.58]That's why I went slow.
[248:49.56]Oh, yes.
[248:50.78]Bugleberry.
[248:58.35]Can I walk on that?
[249:02.25]Or do I jump?
[249:03.71]Can I walk on this?
[249:15.24]Here it comes.
[249:46.16]sorry I I can't hear your donation sorry oh that's completely messed I completely messed it I completely messed it I completely messed it I completely messed it I completely messed it
[250:30.31]What the fuck?!
[250:31.41]No!
[251:10.94]I thought it was much further and I had, I was holding shift and that I, sorry.
[251:18.15]Oh, one more.
[251:18.81]Oh, it's so far.
[251:20.27]At least I did it to the music.
[251:40.00]You know what it was?
[251:40.48]It was the perspective when running up.
[251:43.34]I thought it was much further.
[251:44.98]That's just a regular jump.
[251:46.56]Honestly, a regular jump probably would have gone over too.
[251:52.50]A regular jump would have probably gone over too.
[251:55.94]That's like a jump.
[251:57.14]I don't know.
[251:57.76]It's deceiving.
[252:03.52]Damn it.
[252:04.66]Oh.
[252:07.24]I'm alright with that, though.
[252:10.42]You spider-verse jumped.
[252:13.96]Shit.
[252:14.48]You're so red right now.
[252:16.18]Because I'm just... Like, all that energy just, like, expelled.
[252:24.30]Alright.
[252:25.20]Yeah, no, I think that's a place to call it.
[252:27.16]I don't know if I'll reliably get back up there.
[252:29.34]I'm okay with that.
[252:30.36]That was fun, though.
[252:31.40]That was a really fun game.
[252:36.73]I had it.
[252:38.85]I... Alright, now that's it.
[252:48.99]I was only going to stream for like three hours today anyways.
[252:50.55]I had fun.
[252:52.27]This is a good run.
[252:59.87]I did the peewee dance like an hour ago.
[253:01.38]You missed it.
[253:03.70]Alright guys, I'll see you later.
[253:07.32]Hope you had fun.
[253:08.28]I had a good time.
[253:08.74]That was a fun game to play on stream.
[253:11.96]I will see you guys again in a couple days, maybe?
[253:16.52]Like Wednesday?
[253:26.86]Yeah, Vinny just started doing this.
[253:28.44]Where's Charlie right now?
[253:30.81]Somebody said he was in space.
[253:32.61]Charlie is way, way out of all of our leagues and all of our gaming leagues right now.
[253:42.71]We'll raid Vinny.
[253:44.45]See how he does.
[253:48.71]He's a real gamer?
[253:50.21]Yeah.
[253:52.94]Those are no credits.
[253:54.28]Oops.
[253:55.78]Press the wrong button.
[254:05.39]That was fun.
[254:10.73]What game on Wednesday?
[254:14.37]I don't know.
[254:14.93]We'll figure it out.
[254:19.60]I'm just kind of grabbing random stuff this week.
[254:27.54]You probably would have had it if you wiped your ass.
[254:29.66]Yeah.
[254:31.71]My face one.
[254:32.41]No accolades.
[254:35.40]Yeah, we'll figure it out.
[254:39.07]I'll be in pre-stream.
[254:39.75]We'll just kind of figure it out.
[254:45.87]Thanks for hanging out.
[254:47.13]I think Vinny's getting close to ending, but he did say he was going to do it until he fell.
[254:51.60]So let's go Omega La Laff.
[254:55.30]When he does, maybe he won't.
[254:56.54]Maybe he'll just beat the whole game.
[255:05.83]We know.
[255:07.82]We know.
[255:08.32]By the way, we can tell Vinny.
[255:10.54]Balloon Barry was upgraded to Windmill Winston.
[255:27.13]Windmill Walter.
[255:28.13]Yeah, Windmill Walter is better.
[255:29.17]It's true.
[255:34.11]Thanks for subbing.
[255:35.45]Thanks for watching.
[255:38.25]As always.
[255:40.81]See you next time.
[255:42.45]Call your mother.
[255:42.85]Take care of yourselves.
[255:47.38]Probably start at 4 p.m.
[255:48.24]on Wednesday, not later this time.
[255:51.16]4 p.m.
[255:51.36]Pacific.
[255:54.16]Take it easy.
[255:55.58]Go say hi to Vinny.
[255:58.40]Watch him play this game.
[256:05.88]Ow.
[256:06.34]I gotta move this arm thing.
[256:08.96]Cool game.
[256:09.30]Fun game.
[256:12.88]See you soon.
[256:15.05]Take it easy.
[256:37.06]Thank you.
[257:37.52]you
