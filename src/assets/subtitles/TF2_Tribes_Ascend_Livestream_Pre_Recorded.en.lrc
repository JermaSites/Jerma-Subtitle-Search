[00:09.63]I can hear myself.
[00:13.12]What's going on guys?
[00:20.86]How's your Saturday going?
[00:23.38]Or potentially Sunday if you're from a different country.
[00:30.14]I'll save that for a second here.
[00:31.42]Hold on.
[00:34.40]Okay, okay.
[00:35.16]Make this a little smaller on the right over here.
[00:45.56]So I'm trying something a little different.
[00:47.34]I am trying a... I bought XSplit.
[00:52.32]So I have XSplit here and I'm trying a few things.
[00:55.08]I'm doing the...
[00:56.66]capture source I'm not doing screen region so it's probably gonna be a little different or at least I don't on your end it'll look the same on my and it's gonna be a little bit different alright me shut this out Twitter already have a pre done don't worry it's all pre done
[01:30.82]And there's that.
[01:36.38]And we can close that window.
[01:41.60]I've got to do a YouTube one.
[01:44.02]Where the heck that is?
[01:45.28]There it is.
[01:53.76]Triumphs of End.
[01:57.36]Post.
[02:02.97]Okay.
[02:04.15]Close out that window.
[02:05.25]And then I got this to do.
[02:12.43]Alright.
[02:23.31]We're in business.
[02:34.07]We are in business.
[02:37.50]Alright.
[02:39.06]Let's get in here now.
[02:45.68]So for those of you wondering, I'm going to... This is going to be uploaded to YouTube after this.
[02:52.06]Probably what I'm going to start doing until YouTube gets its act together.
[02:56.53]Because the last time I streamed on YouTube... The last couple times I streamed on YouTube, it was...
[03:03.64]wasn't pretty it was a lot of problems so maybe I'll try doing YouTube next week or something like that I'm not sure but this will be up on YouTube this whole thing refresh again because I didn't check that where from Massachusetts am I from I am from Boston
[03:33.08]I guess I'm not really from Boston.
[03:35.40]I'm kind of from a suburb of Boston, but I'm close enough where I can say I'm from Boston, I guess.
[03:44.24]Let's get a 0 out of 24.
[03:45.50]Any 0 out of 32?
[03:54.36]There is.
[03:54.70]Alright, how about this one?
[04:01.10]Here's the IP.
[04:06.91]I know what Redding is.
[04:07.67]I have family members in Redding.
[04:12.07]That's pretty cool.
[04:14.85]Alright, they... IP's going in the chat right now.
[04:21.66]Make sure I get in there first, and there you go.
[04:28.90]What's going on, guys?
[04:36.53]Bad water basin.
[04:38.03]Let's fill this server up, huh?
[04:52.14]Come on, let's go.
[04:53.04]I don't got all day.
[04:57.55]Who am I kidding?
[04:58.09]I got plenty of time.
[05:00.55]I got all the time in the world.
[05:03.55]That's not really that true, but...
[05:08.46]0 to 0.
[05:12.77]Where is everybody?
[05:17.23]I'm the only person.
[05:17.85]Did I give the right server?
[05:18.85]I think I did, didn't I?
[05:19.73]I hope I did.
[05:26.29]I hope I gave the right server.
[05:27.57]Let me make sure I did.
[05:31.74]This is the one, right?
[05:35.48]Yeah, okay.
[05:35.86]Okay.
[05:38.41]copy never put it in there again just in case just in case I look at that looks like that was the right sir is the hope so I'll let you on fire
[06:08.22]Okay.
[06:09.62]Cool.
[06:14.79]I like your hat, Nimbie.
[06:16.29]You got a cool hat.
[06:20.11]First time in my stream because you are six hours ahead.
[06:22.33]It is late for you.
[06:24.93]You are a late dweller.
[06:29.46]Oh, that guy's lagging.
[06:30.40]I don't want to kill him.
[06:31.44]I feel bad.
[06:34.14]That guy was like slow motion.
[06:42.01]Got my lemonade over here on the left.
[06:46.35]It has been really nice out.
[06:47.77]I don't know what it's been like for you guys, wherever you live, but my goodness, it has been so beautiful out here lately.
[06:54.43]It's been 75 degrees, 80 degrees every single day.
[06:58.17]And I've been going outside a lot.
[07:00.41]I've been taking my new dog for walks.
[07:03.01]You know that deal.
[07:04.21]Oh, I actually killed him.
[07:05.96]Oh, that's a spy.
[07:09.54]Oh, nice shot, dude.
[07:10.92]Nice shooting, Tex.
[07:19.53]Plenty of spots.
[07:20.21]Alright, what do we got here?
[07:28.08]Oh, boy.
[07:30.14]Ooh, good dodging.
[07:35.76]Jump into it.
[07:36.61]Damn.
[07:39.39]How long is the stream ago?
[07:40.23]I just started.
[07:41.03]I literally just started like five minutes ago.
[07:44.01]Oh boy, that's dead.
[07:52.11]Oh, come on.
[07:57.85]Pyro versus Pyro.
[08:00.62]Oh, I didn't kill him.
[08:06.06]Oh, I thought he was going to go to the...
[08:10.03]I'm going to die.
[08:10.73]He knows how much health I have.
[08:13.35]Oh, run away.
[08:15.14]Dead.
[08:20.92]Aquafire 102.
[08:21.86]What's up, dude?
[08:25.30]No Demoman.
[08:25.94]I'll change this up.
[08:26.96]Oh, by the way, if anybody has noticed... I'm not sure if you've noticed.
[08:30.33]Oh, God, there's that spray again.
[08:32.47]But I changed my FOV.
[08:35.56]I made it bigger.
[08:36.72]I'll show you what I did.
[08:37.92]I didn't make it too huge, but here's my FOV now.
[08:42.47]I changed it to like 30% more, and I made my weapon view model like 30% more.
[08:49.85]So if you've noticed that, I know a lot of people were saying, please change that, so I did.
[08:57.02]And it actually is a little bit better.
[08:59.46]Easier to see things.
[09:07.15]Got a healer now, alright.
[09:11.41]That guy's got a Buff Banner.
[09:15.69]Oh!
[09:15.97]I didn't kill him.
[09:17.01]He walked right over it too.
[09:18.84]What?
[09:19.56]Where did he come from?
[09:21.46]Where did he even come from?
[09:23.28]Was he the medic?
[09:24.00]No, the medic was healing me.
[09:27.24]Like, that medic behind me was healing me.
[09:29.12]He just came out of legit nowhere.
[09:31.56]Dear Engie, I sapped your sentry.
[09:33.20]See you again soon.
[09:34.16]LOL, spy.
[09:35.94]Spray over.
[09:38.68]That's a nice spray, though.
[09:39.46]What?
[09:40.04]That's how he gets in here.
[09:41.97]He's still alive.
[09:43.63]Don't let him get me.
[09:47.85]Don't let him get me.
[09:49.13]Oh, he's got nowhere to go now.
[09:51.53]How did he get that?
[09:53.63]He's going to get me.
[09:54.71]He's doing a side stab.
[09:56.85]I'm not going to move.
[09:58.05]Yeah.
[09:59.01]There we go.
[10:01.90]Dear Engie, I sapped your sentry.
[10:04.36]Oh, and I'll move that.
[10:05.62]That's mean.
[10:06.08]Yeah.
[10:06.70]Now we got to... We're getting rolled right now.
[10:11.40]Oh, my God.
[10:12.00]I haven't done anything.
[10:13.27]Why would I have, like, one kill?
[10:21.41]Oh, you're making me waste my stuff, Scout.
[10:27.73]Oh, come on.
[10:30.85]How did I not hit him?
[10:36.22]Get him out of here.
[10:40.98]He's not dead.
[10:41.65]He is not dead.
[10:42.21]He is definitely still alive.
[10:43.27]Alright, let's go for a super spam shot here, dude.
[10:51.99]Come on, walk over that.
[10:53.49]Oh my god.
[10:54.83]Oh god.
[10:58.17]Chaos.
[11:00.05]Why do I have crits for?
[11:03.53]I got... What a waste.
[11:06.20]Let me get the medic at least.
[11:08.16]Oh, thank goodness.
[11:09.00]If I didn't kill that medic, I would have been so upset with myself.
[11:14.68]Oh, cancel.
[11:17.60]Do I like Twitch or do I like YouTube better?
[11:21.30]Um... I mean... YouTube has a lot of problems right now.
[11:25.84]There's a lot of glitches with YouTube.
[11:27.80]There's a lot of bugs and stuff.
[11:30.06]And it's in beta.
[11:30.74]I can understand that.
[11:32.20]But it's, um...
[11:34.46]I would definitely say the process is much easier on Twitch.
[11:37.24]That's what I'll just say, at least.
[11:40.67]The YouTube stream is better quality, though, because I'm partnered on YouTube, and I'm partnered through Machinima, so the YouTube stream will look better.
[11:48.31]But, I don't know.
[11:49.73]Hopefully they fix up some of their bugs.
[11:51.31]I'm confident they will.
[11:57.61]Oh, let's go.
[11:59.61]There he is.
[12:00.83]Whoa!
[12:01.07]Whoa!
[12:06.61]Somebody walked through there.
[12:10.43]Medic!
[12:12.41]Yeah, I'll go combat engine next.
[12:14.75]Absolute.
[12:18.48]Look at all these people.
[12:19.62]My goodness.
[12:21.60]Oh, don't get yourself killed.
[12:25.60]Oh, man.
[12:31.43]Oh, come on.
[12:32.09]Kill somebody.
[12:34.39]Oh, my God.
[12:35.11]Come on, now.
[12:36.78]Oh, I got the medic.
[12:37.56]Good.
[12:39.80]Oh, keep coming.
[12:41.52]Oh, no!
[12:42.80]Come on, give me the health.
[12:45.24]What?
[12:45.50]Uber!
[12:46.06]What?
[12:47.59]Escape!
[12:48.11]Escape!
[12:51.11]Damn.
[12:54.19]I thought I was gonna escape, but I didn't.
[13:01.23]Boom.
[13:04.02]Yeah, after this round I'm gonna go combat, NG.
[13:06.64]Oh, there's a crit dude right there.
[13:11.91]Oh no, give me away!
[13:14.39]Where's the spy?
[13:14.93]Oh, he's up top there.
[13:17.15]He's going up this way.
[13:18.45]Get him!
[13:19.81]No!
[13:21.47]Why am I stuck on the staircase?
[13:23.21]Is that another spy?
[13:23.98]Yeah, there he is.
[13:27.14]I love how it's just like everyone's running frantically around chasing the spy.
[13:31.28]Oh, walk over that, please.
[13:33.00]Somebody go to the left side.
[13:34.50]Come on.
[13:36.41]dare you.
[13:37.67]I double dog dare you.
[13:40.60]Anybody up there?
[13:43.88]I'll leave that there.
[13:45.08]That can be the defense.
[13:49.44]Spam.
[13:51.80]Oh, God.
[13:52.88]Anybody in the car?
[13:53.78]No, not yet.
[13:57.40]Get away from me.
[13:59.84]Yeah, come on.
[14:00.26]Get on the car now.
[14:01.50]Come step on that car.
[14:02.82]You know you want to.
[14:07.13]Come on, get him.
[14:08.95]Somebody get on that god, I want to blow it up.
[14:16.60]I need to get healed.
[14:18.88]Wait, is there... There's a spy up at spawn, isn't there?
[14:22.08]I might have to go deal with that.
[14:23.24]Hold on.
[14:24.91]Oh, I just launched myself into nowhere.
[14:27.41]What?
[14:27.83]What is going on?
[14:28.91]Why?
[14:29.85]Why are they bouncing?
[14:31.49]Oh, well, because... Where's the spy?
[14:36.86]It's freaking me out.
[14:41.76]Was that a sniper?
[14:44.36]No.
[14:46.85]Yikes.
[14:48.61]The IP, I linked it a while ago.
[14:52.09]I'm going to be changing servers after this anyways.
[14:54.41]Get more people into the game.
[14:57.91]There's a lot of people in this room.
[15:01.83]Oh, there's definitely a lot of people still in here.
[15:05.29]All crits.
[15:06.43]Oh, I didn't get anybody.
[15:07.29]Come on.
[15:15.71]Damn.
[15:15.85]Soldier.
[15:16.43]Hold on.
[15:16.79]I gotta deal with this.
[15:19.09]Oh!
[15:22.07]That's a spy.
[15:23.93]That's definitely a spy.
[15:24.85]No way.
[15:26.76]Maybe not.
[15:27.82]No, it's not a spy.
[15:30.38]Wow.
[15:36.04]Oh, my God.
[15:37.06]I was not ready for this, but I'm going to do it anyways.
[15:38.68]Let's do it.
[15:39.86]Oh, come on.
[15:40.24]Have there be something over here?
[15:41.20]I can blow people up.
[15:41.92]Come on.
[15:46.94]Oh, die, you bastard.
[15:54.92]Jerma is a wizard.
[15:56.26]Official.
[16:06.81]Let's go, woohoo!
[16:10.05]Oh man, look at all those people.
[16:12.19]How am I doing?
[16:14.79]Eh, not that bad.
[16:18.52]Eh, no 720 here.
[16:20.66]I am not partnered on Twitch.
[16:27.02]It's over.
[16:28.09]IO Gaming.
[16:29.19]Register today.
[16:35.79]I killed myself.
[16:36.71]Damn.
[16:44.43]I want to start live streaming soon.
[16:45.97]Any advice on how to get started?
[16:47.75]Oh yeah.
[16:49.52]Most important thing is your internet needs to be able to handle it.
[16:52.94]That's I'd say the number one thing.
[16:54.66]Go to speedtest.net and run a speed test.
[16:58.64]And I'd say if you're upload speed...
[17:01.94]is less than 1, like 1.0, 1 megabit per second up, I'd say it might be difficult for you to stream, like, in good quality.
[17:11.55]But if you're higher than 1 or 2 megs up, you should be fine to stream.
[17:18.43]But, I mean, you guys have been here before when I've had problems streaming.
[17:20.85]I mean, I have 10 up connection.
[17:23.11]And, oh my god.
[17:25.59]Oh my god, somebody run over that.
[17:27.32]There we go.
[17:31.88]Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[17:33.14]That's what I wanted.
[17:33.92]Run.
[17:36.64]But you guys have been to streams before where it's been unwatchable from lag.
[17:40.53]And I have a 10-up connection.
[17:42.77]It's just weird.
[17:44.39]The internet is a weird place.
[17:51.91]And also, I'd also say you need a pretty good processor and video card.
[17:55.38]Because essentially your computer's doing kind of like double work.
[18:01.10]Oof.
[18:03.31]No, I got Crit Rocket.
[18:09.69]Oh, I got two cats, man.
[18:10.72]I love cats.
[18:13.70]I love any animal.
[18:15.92]The only animal that I could probably say I don't like is... I don't know.
[18:22.00]Maybe like... This is a hard question.
[18:25.84]The only animal that I don't think I would like to... Oh my god, another Uber.
[18:29.24]This is ridiculous.
[18:30.83]I'm like the Uber machine tonight.
[18:40.82]It was crazy.
[18:42.40]Anyways, probably an animal big enough that will literally kill me if I go near it.
[18:48.44]So, probably something like that.
[18:54.11]Oh yeah, four up is fine.
[18:56.47]You'll be fine with four up.
[19:02.63]Here we go.
[19:06.91]Oh, boy.
[19:08.27]God, I feel like the other team's getting neglected.
[19:12.03]Spread the Ubers around.
[19:13.12]I don't need them all.
[19:13.88]No, I'm just kidding.
[19:17.10]We're going up top here.
[19:19.18]Or I could just apparently not detonate the mine.
[19:21.96]What's going on here?
[19:24.22]What's going on here?
[19:25.70]So many people.
[19:27.40]So many people to spam.
[19:33.26]This is chaos.
[19:36.84]Oh, this is absolute chaos.
[19:38.54]Oh my god!
[19:43.81]This is ridiculous.
[19:45.53]32 player servers are insanity.
[19:52.15]Yeah, this... Oh my god, yeah, there's a full group in here, man.
[19:58.86]Yeah, right after this round ends, I'm gonna hop in a new server.
[20:03.13]Oh, fly.
[20:09.51]Oh, that's a double.
[20:10.82]That's a double.
[20:16.82]Let's go up here.
[20:20.40]Hey.
[20:20.72]Hey, you.
[20:21.50]Oh, you're real.
[20:24.00]I was going to high five him.
[20:32.50]Oh, you want a high five?
[20:33.68]Oh, sure, I'll high five you.
[20:34.92]And then just explode myself.
[20:39.06]Wow, that was pretty unintelligent of me.
[20:43.52]But yeah, that's what I do.
[20:45.88]Alright, new server.
[20:48.47]I'm going to say new server.
[20:55.19]Boink.
[21:00.72]Oh, you want to... See, my brain... A lot of you guys already know this.
[21:06.01]Sometimes I just don't think.
[21:08.43]It happens quite often, actually.
[21:14.05]Alright, let's see.
[21:15.45]Let's see here.
[21:22.72]Hmm.
[21:23.54]I would say let's play a randomizer server, but...
[21:25.87]For my streams, I like to get a lot of people into the games.
[21:30.33]As many people as I possibly can that are watching.
[21:33.19]So I don't want to just, you know, because most of the randomizer and arena mod type servers, they're always full.
[21:39.56]They always have, you know, 23 out of 24.
[21:41.38]So I would be the only one that would be able to get in.
[21:44.78]So I like to have people from the stream get priority and come and play and stuff like that.
[21:50.88]Let's find another server.
[21:52.34]This one was 32.
[21:53.04]Alright, oh my god, there's so many loading.
[21:59.07]looking for 32.
[22:01.16]Hightower got a bunch of bots.
[22:06.46]Will I ever do a workout video?
[22:09.32]I've thrown it around.
[22:11.24]I was going to do it a long time ago.
[22:14.06]But it's just, I don't know if people would even watch it.
[22:17.64]I know that there would be a very small group of people that would probably watch it.
[22:22.64]But I don't know how it would be received.
[22:25.38]I think a lot of people would be like, what the hell are you doing?
[22:28.81]Why are you, like, lifting weights?
[22:32.77]24, 20, maybe 32.
[22:33.21]Okay.
[22:33.67]Well, here you go.
[22:39.05]Good old-fashioned Dust Bowl.
[22:42.28]Here is the IP.
[22:48.88]Oh, and everyone's always asking about Enlighten, the new Enlighten.
[22:52.62]I'm working on it right now.
[22:54.16]So there will be a new Enlighten in the next couple days.
[22:58.19]Working on it right now.
[23:04.43]Yeah, I'll probably do another one of those videos where I give advice.
[23:09.00]And I'll probably do, like, maybe a one or two minute vlog type thing where I show you some stuff.
[23:14.64]But I'm not sure I would do, like, a 20 minute workout video.
[23:17.90]Like, okay, then up, then down, then up, then left.
[23:21.46]I think that would just be odd.
[23:22.84]I mean, I think that would be very weird.
[23:24.18]Let's go blue.
[23:26.10]I was red last time.
[23:26.88]Let's go blue.
[23:33.78]Oh, boom.
[23:34.64]Boom.
[23:35.48]What do I want to use?
[23:37.98]Oh, the new PDA.
[23:38.62]What's it going to be?
[23:39.50]Oh my god!
[23:46.06]And up.
[23:46.88]And down.
[23:47.68]And left.
[23:48.52]And egg.
[23:53.03]And egg.
[23:55.93]Alright, let me say this.
[23:57.57]Would you guys watch an egg workout video?
[24:04.79]Like, if it was the egg.
[24:08.51]What do I want to even play with?
[24:10.17]I'll stay with this.
[24:12.32]I'll stick with this.
[24:12.98]Why not?
[24:15.30]Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[24:20.24]This server's like... Does this server look weird to me?
[24:24.20]I'm like lagging.
[24:26.05]Oh, I'm trying... I tried to high five him.
[24:32.27]Oh, wait.
[24:32.49]You can just hold your hand like that?
[24:34.73]Oh, yeah.
[24:35.61]High five, baby.
[24:39.23]I don't know if it's, like, the server or not, but is everybody, like, all jumpy?
[24:42.37]Because they are on my screen.
[24:43.59]Like, look at... Does anybody else see that?
[24:47.13]We'll go... I don't want to... We'll go for one or two rounds like this.
[24:53.96]Oh, high five.
[24:54.60]Here we go.
[24:55.80]Yeah, I mean...
[25:02.86]Oh, God, everyone's, like, jumping all over the place for me.
[25:08.80]Oh!
[25:10.82]Central Dam!
[25:13.10]Hey, hey, hey!
[25:14.22]What do you think you're doing?
[25:20.12]Oh, but I forgot I was going to answer that question.
[25:22.00]The reason why I don't do auto-reload is because... Is somebody in here?
[25:26.44]Like, the ghost of the pyro is in that room with me.
[25:29.05]Oh, no.
[25:29.99]Oh, God, what do I do?
[25:33.49]Alright, well here we are.
[25:37.59]I'll block your way out.
[25:38.95]You can't get out.
[25:39.75]You're a Dead Ringer.
[25:41.82]I got you blocked in.
[25:42.64]Hey.
[25:51.56]There's a tip right there.
[25:52.48]If you shoot a Dead Ringer and you know he's a Dead Ringer, just stand in the middle of the hallway.
[25:56.36]And he can't get by you.
[25:58.20]At least sometimes.
[26:02.04]Oh, Dispatch are going up, up here.
[26:03.78]I don't know why I decided to put him here.
[26:05.18]This is a bad idea.
[26:07.64]Oh, jeez.
[26:10.64]Where is my Mini-Sentry?
[26:11.76]Why is it still alive?
[26:13.27]Oh, my God.
[26:13.67]I'm getting distracted.
[26:19.39]I get distracted.
[26:19.97]I have ADD, man.
[26:21.71]Wow, we already won?
[26:24.45]My goodness.
[26:27.89]Oh, my goodness.
[26:30.58]FG Spidey.
[26:32.12]Bet you I can say your name.
[26:34.24]I bet you a dollar I can say your name.
[26:39.40]32-man Dust Bowl is chaos.
[26:43.46]I'm gonna go Huntsman Sniper.
[26:47.75]If you want to throw me a duel, I'll absolutely do you.
[26:52.13]Ah!
[26:56.97]Oh, now I gotta... Hold on.
[26:57.83]Let me say I gotta...
[26:59.58]Cyanid... Cyanagosa.
[27:01.66]I think that's how you say it.
[27:03.32]Cyanagosa.
[27:06.88]And, oh, by the way, if you're watching this on YouTube, because I'm going to upload this to YouTube afterwards, yes, I am responding to people in the chat, so don't just think I have, like, some kind of weird disorder where I just say, like, random words.
[27:17.59]I think I said that last time, too.
[27:24.13]Oh, come on.
[27:24.65]This guy is going to get headshot.
[27:26.36]Right now.
[27:28.08]Right now.
[27:28.46]Here we go.
[27:28.70]Ready?
[27:28.84]Ready?
[27:30.22]I don't think you know, I don't think you understand.
[27:31.68]I don't think you understand, here it comes.
[27:36.20]Oh my god, he killed me!
[27:39.04]Oh, no, a different guy did.
[27:42.74]Eggs.
[27:44.90]Look at this, like, egg.
[27:51.60]Man, this server is lagging for me, I'll tell you right now.
[27:54.14]Oh, look at this double spy collateral.
[27:59.85]Oh no, run away.
[28:08.09]Oh!
[28:08.43]Tag!
[28:12.75]Oh, I can't even aim at people.
[28:14.24]My, like, screen is like, d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d like a jellyfish.
[28:18.18]Oh, he got me.
[28:20.06]He got me.
[28:27.40]Boom.
[28:28.20]Boom.
[28:30.69]Look at the server.
[28:32.13]I don't think the server was designed to have this many people in it.
[28:36.25]Oh, what, you want to get covered in Jurati?
[28:38.77]Is that what you're saying?
[28:39.59]You want me to come smash you?
[28:40.81]Is that what you just said?
[28:41.65]You want me to come, like, smash your face in?
[28:43.75]I got him.
[28:48.06]Fan of Kid Icarus?
[28:48.82]I never played it.
[28:50.42]Not even the original, and I'm an old bastard, and I didn't even play the original.
[28:57.88]Oh, that would have been sick.
[29:00.93]I heard somebody.
[29:01.43]God, I love to kill somebody.
[29:11.30]Finally.
[29:13.58]I got my first kill ever.
[29:14.78]Whoa!
[29:16.62]Did you see where I shot?
[29:18.36]If you're watching this, like, on YouTube, please rewind that and look at where I shot.
[29:22.55]I shot, like, five feet over that guy's head.
[29:24.85]And I still killed him.
[29:27.37]No!
[29:27.51]No!
[29:31.40]Oh, God.
[29:34.08]Let's just... Alright, let's do it.
[29:37.16]Oh, there was no way I was going to get out of there.
[29:48.29]A good, affordable graphics card.
[29:51.65]That's a good one.
[29:54.29]I'd say probably the GTX 550 or the 560.
[30:00.31]I think those are both under 200 bucks.
[30:02.49]I think.
[30:03.81]Or under 100.
[30:04.33]I think the 550 is... I don't know.
[30:06.11]The 550 Ti, I think it's called.
[30:07.69]I don't even remember.
[30:09.51]Boom.
[30:10.43]Oh, I missed him!
[30:12.53]Oh, God.
[30:16.15]I think egg should be a weapon.
[30:17.41]I don't know how well they'd work.
[30:22.54]Oh, SimSass.
[30:23.64]You got the 550?
[30:24.10]Is the, uh... How much is the 550?
[30:29.50]And follow-up, is it a good graphics card?
[30:37.47]Here we go.
[30:38.97]Oh my god.
[30:39.49]Hey, what's going on?
[30:42.89]Just hiding over here, away from you.
[30:48.19]No, no, please don't kill me, please!
[30:56.93]Did you buy the 550, or did it come with your computer?
[31:02.75]For my thinking.
[31:07.84]Medic, cover me!
[31:08.64]Oh, I didn't get him.
[31:11.26]Crap.
[31:13.46]Okay, yeah.
[31:14.24]So, the 550 is only like 130 bucks.
[31:17.48]I'd say that's a good graphics card to be able to save a little bit of money.
[31:22.04]Because the 580 is... Jeez, what, like $500?
[31:25.06]Something like that?
[31:28.87]I know it's up there.
[31:31.17]And they're already working on the 600, aren't they?
[31:33.27]The 600 series?
[31:37.57]Oof.
[31:39.01]What's that?
[31:41.11]Okay, you're real.
[31:41.83]You're the real deal.
[31:42.55]I got you.
[31:48.24]Oh, cover them all.
[31:49.28]Okay, okay.
[31:49.86]Did I even get...
[31:51.81]No!
[31:52.91]Get this one guy, come on!
[31:58.79]The 680 is out now?
[32:00.27]Oh, dear lord, what is that, like $900?
[32:02.42]I can only imagine.
[32:11.96]Woo!
[32:17.97]I don't think we're going to win this.
[32:22.55]Oh god, there's people over there too.
[32:29.61]Alright, I'm going this way.
[32:33.32]Nobody up here?
[32:34.58]We almost just got it.
[32:37.58]Oh, he's still alive.
[32:38.28]He's still alive.
[32:40.26]Hey, he's turning around.
[32:41.04]He's behind you.
[32:43.37]Oh my god.
[32:45.07]Dude.
[32:46.49]You just like crushed that guy.
[32:50.57]Jeez.
[32:52.88]Oh, forget that.
[32:53.60]I'm going this way.
[32:57.55]Oh, my God.
[33:03.47]What's my favorite movie?
[33:05.61]Hmm.
[33:08.79]I don't know.
[33:10.11]Probably Ghostbusters, or Memento, or The Dark Knight, or one of the Muppet movies, or... There's a lot of movies I've watched that I like.
[33:20.35]I'm not a big movie watcher, though.
[33:21.39]I'm not even a big TV watcher, either.
[33:25.91]Oh, my God!
[33:26.57]I just missed his head.
[33:34.87]Oh, this guy could be toast.
[33:36.41]Oh, my God!
[33:39.43]They're all here for me.
[33:44.17]Oh, this guy doesn't even know I'm here.
[33:47.61]Damn it!
[33:54.49]Fight Club is also a good one, Ari.
[33:56.05]Fight Club is a good one.
[33:56.91]I remember the first time I watched Fight Club.
[34:02.61]I was so confused.
[34:03.51]I think I was like 16 or like 17.
[34:07.67]When did that movie come out?
[34:08.91]Somebody do a quick research and find out.
[34:10.60]When did Fight Club release?
[34:11.74]Like, when did it come out in theaters?
[34:14.82]Get somebody right in the foot.
[34:15.68]Ready?
[34:16.34]Right in the toe.
[34:17.34]Aww.
[34:19.58]Oh my god.
[34:20.54]Hide.
[34:24.73]You want to see if grandpa can beatbox?
[34:27.67]I don't think he can.
[34:29.71]I would assume grandpa could not beatbox.
[34:31.33]1999, okay.
[34:31.45]Oh!
[34:31.53]So that means I was... So 10 years ago was 2009.
[34:35.45]So 10, 11, 12.
[34:37.84]So that was 13 years ago.
[34:38.62]I was... Hmm.
[34:39.32]So I'm 26. 16...
[34:53.66]15, 14, 13.
[34:54.10]I definitely didn't watch it when I was 13.
[34:56.58]I don't think my parents would have let me do that.
[35:05.65]Once I watched it, I think the first time I watched it was when I was 15 or 16, something like that.
[35:12.27]And I was confused.
[35:14.33]I was absolutely confused.
[35:18.60]Office Space is a good movie, too.
[35:21.66]The thing is, I've seen a lot of movies, but I don't watch a lot of movies.
[35:24.66]If that makes any sense to anybody, then... Oh my god, I just accidentally got that guy.
[35:31.59]Greetings from Chile?
[35:32.39]Well, greetings from East Coast USA, dude.
[35:37.15]It's either very early or very late for you, I'm not sure.
[35:39.43]Actually, no, I think we're in the same time zone.
[35:41.70]We're close, the same time zone.
[35:44.86]Oh my god.
[35:45.82]Alright, time to play Scout.
[35:47.16]Scout.
[35:51.00]My real name is Jeremy.
[35:53.60]It's Jeremy.
[35:54.92]J-E-R-E-M-Y.
[35:59.56]Look at all these people he's blowing out.
[36:00.78]Look at this good pyro right here.
[36:03.18]Just running around, blowing all the teammates out.
[36:06.66]You get a gold star.
[36:10.18]No, it's not Jeremiah.
[36:11.76]It's just Jeremy.
[36:14.96]Oh, there's a lot of people right there.
[36:21.88]Hmm, watch it, watch it, watch it.
[36:29.26]I can't, alright, scout's not gonna work.
[36:32.87]I'll go medic.
[36:35.41]Do I like Irish people?
[36:36.53]I do, I am Irish.
[36:39.11]I am Irish, so.
[36:46.63]Look at this server.
[36:47.87]Alright, after, uh,
[36:50.21]I'm going to change servers after I die next, just because this server is very laggy.
[36:54.67]Look at this guy.
[36:55.10]It looks like he's part of a claymation.
[36:57.30]Look at this claymation server we're on.
[37:05.70]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[37:11.58]Oh, this is why I like the Quick-Fix, because you can just do this and it makes sense.
[37:15.14]Oh my god, that was the guy I just healed.
[37:20.22]New server.
[37:26.34]Yeah, new server.
[37:26.86]What's this?
[37:29.25]Oh, yeah.
[37:30.15]He defeated me.
[37:34.21]Probably hop in one more server.
[37:36.67]And try some Tribes Ascend.
[37:38.01]Because that game is really cool.
[37:43.45]Let's go 0 out of 24 this time.
[37:45.62]Just to keep the lag factor down a little.
[37:51.70]King of the Hill Sawmill.
[37:52.78]No.
[37:53.02]King of the Hill Nucleus.
[37:54.62]That could be good.
[38:04.28]High Tower.
[38:06.45]I'm torn, guys.
[38:07.31]I don't know where to go.
[38:10.79]You are garbage, Jerma.
[38:12.21]Why?
[38:13.17]What did I do?
[38:20.21]Badwater.
[38:22.93]Mountain Lab.
[38:26.81]A day in the life of Jerva.
[38:29.68]Where I just eat like Cheetos and take a bath.
[38:33.86]Alright, we're going to go here.
[38:38.26]We're going to go to Viaduct.
[38:42.97]Koth Viaduct.
[38:43.99]There's the IP.
[38:53.46]I put the IP right in chat.
[38:55.44]It should say a little camera next to my name.
[39:06.19]Let's go.
[39:06.77]Let's go spy.
[39:15.01]This is a very weird loadout.
[39:16.25]I'm not sure what I was trying to do here.
[39:17.49]Gentlemen.
[39:24.51]I got the strange Dead Ringer.
[39:31.68]This server's full.
[39:32.40]This server's full.
[39:33.22]Sermer, what am I talking about?
[39:44.03]If you can't get in or you're trying to get in, I do apologize.
[39:53.45]I think I do have a strange... Oh, damn.
[39:58.41]Thanks for pointing that out.
[40:00.93]Well, it's going to belong to somebody else pretty soon, so... Might as well rack up as many kills on it as I can, right?
[40:11.56]Hey, look, I'm an engineer walking at you from the other side.
[40:14.58]Ow, you got me.
[40:15.81]Damn.
[40:17.15]How dare you kill me like that?
[40:30.66]If I could go pro at any sport, baseball.
[40:35.24]I've always wanted to be a baseball player.
[40:38.83]Not exactly sure why, but I just have.
[40:40.35]I used to play baseball when I was younger.
[40:45.29]Into high school, then I stopped in high school.
[40:52.79]Oh, my dead... Wait, now they're going to all know that I just dead rung.
[40:56.38]Dead rung?
[40:56.84]Is that even like a word?
[40:57.58]Alright.
[41:04.06]Oh, let's protect this point.
[41:05.64]I'm a pyro.
[41:06.24]I do that the best.
[41:09.38]That was just a scared chaos stab right there.
[41:19.37]Oh, the team is still trickling in.
[41:25.10]Well, look, I'm just coming out of spawn myself.
[41:29.18]Hey, let's get out of spawn together.
[41:30.58]What?
[41:35.12]Oh, Jerma, I'm cheating.
[41:36.16]I'm watching your stream.
[41:42.11]Is my name even Jerma right now yet?
[41:43.67]Oh, Scrumpadum.
[41:48.29]Harvey Hamburger.
[41:50.51]George Bumberson.
[41:52.31]I go by a lot of different titles.
[41:56.78]I won't get out of my way.
[41:58.28]Oh, you son of a bee.
[42:00.76]Well, that's like five million deaths in a row as a spy.
[42:03.48]Time to change something else.
[42:12.35]Low FPS.
[42:16.15]Oh, what am I even using?
[42:18.05]Okay, I'll rock with this.
[42:20.33]I'll roll with this.
[42:21.01]I'm cool with that.
[42:25.05]Thought there was a spy.
[42:33.45]Aww.
[42:36.97]What just happened?
[42:37.89]Oh, my brain.
[42:40.09]There was a soldier right there?
[42:41.18]Oh, I just killed that medic.
[42:42.26]I'm sorry, dude.
[42:43.00]I don't think I've ever had a embarrassing name.
[42:55.62]Oh, my preferred breakfast food?
[42:57.16]Oh, are you kidding me?
[42:59.62]Eggs.
[43:01.47]I had to say it.
[43:03.80]What do we got here?
[43:06.15]No more fooling around.
[43:06.91]Let's get some kills.
[43:10.57]Let's kill some bastards.
[43:12.97]Get on this point.
[43:14.47]Boys and girls.
[43:17.80]Oh, where is he?
[43:22.60]You are a spy.
[43:25.33]Yep, because you're invisible now.
[43:31.91]Well, that was a total not good idea.
[43:36.05]Oh!
[43:36.69]What was... What... Did I jump in the air?
[43:43.08]Did I... What just happened to me?
[43:49.21]I... I don't even understand how that happened.
[43:53.49]Maybe I did jump.
[43:55.67]That was weird.
[44:00.48]Kill Jerma.
[44:01.68]Nice name.
[44:02.66]At least I got one kill that round.
[44:15.59]Boink.
[44:16.31]Boink.
[44:17.07]Boink.
[44:17.81]Boink.
[44:18.57]Boink.
[44:19.31]Boink.
[44:21.29]How do you open console?
[44:22.25]It's the tilde key.
[44:23.29]Thing under escape.
[44:33.83]I gotta do some expert rocket jumping, guys.
[44:37.41]Here we go.
[44:39.17]Expert rocket jumper.
[44:42.21]Check me out.
[44:42.89]I'll be on... I don't even know what the name of the site is.
[44:51.09]So wait, why would I give up TF2?
[44:52.97]I thought I made this explicitly clear that I never was.
[45:01.78]TF2 is...
[45:03.52]a huge part of my existence.
[45:11.69]Oh, no.
[45:12.65]Oh, no.
[45:14.19]Where is Otto?
[45:15.11]That's a good question.
[45:17.97]That's a sniper and he's going to... No, he's not.
[45:19.51]What is that?
[45:23.93]God, that was awful.
[45:27.83]There we go.
[45:33.08]Can I get like a string of two and three in a row here?
[45:46.04]And you!
[45:55.97]Alright.
[45:56.69]At least I'm killing people now.
[46:03.34]Oh, my Liberty Launcher is now a new rank.
[46:14.71]Yeah, I understand that, Phenomenal.
[46:17.53]But, to be honest, the items that I have in my backpack right now, I mean, I know, I can understand, like, oh, he's giving away his whole backpack, he's gonna quit.
[46:26.73]I understand that, but I mean, I have a lot of friends in Team Fortress, and a lot of people that... Oh god, hold on.
[46:35.35]Oh god, I just totally ruined that foot.
[46:39.34]Oh my god.
[46:41.10]But I got a lot of friends in Team Fortress, and I have a lot of people that support me with this channel.
[46:46.64]So any item that I ever want to use, I can just get it back.
[46:49.96]It might not be strange, it might not be genuine, but that's... I don't care.
[46:54.42]I figured because, like I said in the video, I started with Team Fortress 2, and I got all the support from you guys from Team Fortress, a lot of you guys are Team Fortress guys, and that was a decent, decent shot.
[47:10.38]And that's why I felt like doing it, you know, it's just something I felt like doing, and mine's made up, no going back now, so it's gonna happen.
[47:19.09]And let's see if I can, no, there's a mini sector.
[47:29.48]After this round, go to one more server and then I'm going to hop in Tribe Descent.
[47:42.44]Boing, boing.
[47:44.38]No, that was laggy.
[47:51.28]Oh, I didn't want to do that.
[47:54.71]Oh my god.
[47:58.63]What is going on with that guy?
[47:59.65]That guy was just skydiving right there.
[48:06.27]Oh, I'm dead.
[48:07.97]I am so dead.
[48:15.94]Oh, you lagged out?
[48:16.56]Yeah.
[48:16.68]Boom.
[48:26.47]Mission ends in 60 seconds.
[48:28.79]Mission ends in 60 seconds.
[48:36.25]Oh, how did I not hit him?
[48:38.39]Mini-Sentry, get out of here!
[48:42.16]Oh, there's a sniper.
[48:43.62]Good to know.
[48:53.46]This is where we get into trouble.
[48:56.75]Somebody snipe us.
[49:00.72]He's still alive.
[49:02.06]Watch the spawn.
[49:03.28]Optimus Prime is on the loose.
[49:09.60]No, you're real.
[49:12.75]Where could he be?
[49:17.67]Gotta get on that point.
[49:22.03]Get on it.
[49:22.59]There we go.
[49:23.85]Everyone just stop on here right now.
[49:27.34]Go.
[49:31.87]Ah, missed.
[49:35.97]Alright, 1 minute 40 seconds.
[49:37.11]We got this.
[49:46.79]Mmm, gotta back up.
[49:50.32]Damn, every time I shoot a crit rocket, it just goes right by everybody.
[49:57.75]track.
[50:00.61]Oh, oh.
[50:05.81]Oh, no, no, no.
[50:09.46]No, I just ruined this again.
[50:11.50]Oh, I'm sorry, Medic.
[50:18.76]I'm an idiot.
[50:20.17]Okay.
[50:27.77]Aw.
[50:32.59]Yeah, Tribes is a free-to-play game right now.
[50:35.65]I would suggest everyone to go get it.
[50:37.95]If you play Team Fortress, you'll probably like Tribes.
[50:41.89]It's just another one of those kind of fast-paced, you know, projectile-based, crazy fun games.
[50:49.08]FPS, it's a first-person shooter.
[50:51.52]Alright, so let's do a new serve.
[50:54.86]New serve.
[50:58.44]Alright, we'll get one more server here, then I'm gonna hop into Tribes for probably like a half an hour or so.
[51:14.15]Zero out of 32.
[51:17.36]Okay, let's go to, we got, this one is open, and it's Dust Bowl.
[51:23.56]We already did Dust Bowl.
[51:27.83]Busy Town?
[51:28.51]What the hell is Busy Town?
[51:32.72]This one's well.
[51:33.42]We can do well.
[51:36.60]Actually, no, no, no, no.
[51:37.64]That server might not be able to... Alright, we'll go to this one.
[51:42.30]CTF well.
[51:44.61]And there you are.
[51:45.25]Everyone join it.
[51:57.01]Empty randomizer?
[51:59.67]Um... I mean, randomizer... Is it really empty?
[52:09.43]So those servers are legit empty right now?
[52:19.63]No?
[52:20.07]Okay.
[52:21.91]Next week we'll do randomizer.
[52:26.67]We'll do some randomizer next week.
[52:29.29]I'm going to use the Shortstop and the... I'm going to put on the whole set.
[52:40.44]Why not, right?
[52:41.54]Why not?
[52:51.57]Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[52:56.45]Oh, the round's not even started.
[52:57.47]I'm going to get a kill.
[52:59.53]No, I'm not.
[53:00.59]Too bad.
[53:05.67]Woohoo!
[53:06.85]Oh, I'm going to sneeze.
[53:07.61]I'm going to sneeze and there's nothing I can do about it.
[53:09.05]Oh, I'm going to sneeze.
[53:11.07]Here it comes.
[53:13.33]No.
[53:14.33]False alarm.
[53:15.35]No.
[53:17.09]Oh, man.
[53:19.01]Sorry.
[53:20.01]There's no button I can press to mute me.
[53:23.45]Are we getting spawn trapped?
[53:24.65]What's going on?
[53:27.78]Thank you.
[53:32.34]Monarch!
[53:36.89]Get me in here.

[54:38.06]How is that... Unless I actually really just killed him.
[54:40.04]I don't think I did, though.

[54:45.54]There's the health.
[54:46.20]That's what I wanted.

[55:40.83]Oh, just jump over everybody.
[55:42.35]Try and get around.
[55:43.79]Oh, I was hit by the train.

[56:41.38]We got a troll!
[56:42.08]Alright, one more round of this.
[56:50.65]I'm gonna go Pyro this time.
[56:57.68]Hmm... I always not... I don't put on... Let's go... Yeah.
[57:09.19]Alright, last round, then I'm going to hop over to Tribes Ascend.
[57:11.59]Damn.
[57:12.55]Ah!
[57:21.58]Alright, I got to appear offline.
[57:30.56]We can't have any spam coming at me, especially when it has bad, bad things.
[57:44.59]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[57:47.69]Is somebody behind us still?
[57:48.69]Oh, there he is.
[57:51.37]No!
[57:51.97]God, I turned and saw the goddamn train.
[57:57.80]Ugh.
[57:57.96]I don't think I even have the hat that the Degreaser said, to be honest.
[58:05.50]Nah, I don't have the hat.
[58:09.35]You know, I saw, I thought I could get by, and then I turned and scared the crap out of myself.
[58:20.15]Oh my god, they have crits.
[58:21.97]Shoot it at me.
[58:22.77]Come on.
[58:24.05]Alright, don't get hit by the train again.
[58:31.63]I almost got hit by the train again.
[58:40.99]No, I'm gonna Mac you.
[58:42.53]Oh, damn it.
[58:48.24]Where's Berga Boy?
[58:56.22]Where's Berga Boy?
[59:02.60]How am I not lighting him on fire?
[59:08.53]Oh, does that mean we're going to play Tribes Ascend with Burgah Boy?
[59:12.18]Special guest appearance from Burgah Boy?
[59:21.22]God damn it, Burgah Boy.
[59:22.42]Reveal yourself.
[59:25.79]He has.
[59:28.57]Burgah Boy's been in videos.
[59:33.33]Oh, I'm out of ammo.
[59:35.75]Oh, fuck.
[59:38.42]Oh, God.
[59:41.16]Oh, my Powerjack.
[59:41.98]Would I get one kill with it?
[59:46.61]Alright, Train.
[59:47.41]Me versus you.
[59:48.97]What do you say, buddy?
[59:49.87]Let's do this.
[59:50.51]I lost.
[60:07.48]Oh, we got crits.
[60:08.70]Yes!
[60:11.46]I just want to crit fire somebody.
[60:15.81]Feels good to crit fire.
[60:23.93]It feels good to crit fire.
[60:24.98]Alright, we're going Sniper.
[60:30.18]No we're not, I'm going Heavy.
[60:36.02]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run!
[60:39.66]Get away!
[60:40.41]Oh, come on!
[60:41.37]Right when I get out of spawn!
[60:44.57]B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T with six exclamation points after that.
[60:55.84]Wait, why do I have the Natascha equipped?
[60:59.32]Okay, whatever.
[61:06.26]I'm so scared.
[61:06.88]Wait, I killed the spy from like 5,000 feet away?
[61:10.84]Right.
[61:11.60]Where is this guy?
[61:12.36]Oh my god!
[61:14.50]He's on the roof.
[61:15.34]I thought he was to the right.
[61:16.26]Alright, take this stupid thing off.
[61:20.62]Give me the regular minigun.
[61:31.42]Bin bin bin bin bin bin bin bin bin.
[61:35.87]I gotta, like, really watch my back now.
[61:39.05]Playing heavy.
[61:39.83]Probably the worst idea I could have ever done.
[61:45.66]I'm gonna be on fire.
[61:46.56]Die, die, die, die.
[61:47.22]Get away, get away.
[61:49.44]Oh, thank you so much.
[61:50.82]Oh, no.
[61:51.18]Here comes another dude.
[61:57.98]How are you still alive?
[61:59.32]What?
[62:00.09]I can't find the train again.
[62:03.65]Okay.
[62:09.22]Of course I get hit by the train again.
[62:11.95]That would absolutely happen.
[62:13.17]Oh, for the love of God.
[62:18.75]Ugh.
[62:19.79]Hey, we're gonna get crits, I think.
[62:22.53]I hope we get crits right now.
[62:26.03]Oh my God, of course.
[62:27.95]We get crits and I die and I'm dead.
[62:29.71]Ugh.
[62:36.81]Ugh.
[62:40.02]Take that.
[62:40.70]Take this.
[62:41.32]Take that.
[62:50.32]How are you still alive?
[62:52.69]I knew it.
[62:53.05]I knew there was a guy behind us.
[62:57.41]Oh, fuck.
[62:57.65]Here we go.
[62:58.07]32-person servers are just, like, ridiculous.
[63:00.35]They are, like, insane.
[63:03.93]Insanity.
[63:05.90]It's like you walk out the door and it's just like...
[63:14.36]Where is this guy?
[63:16.24]I'm so scared of the spy just backstabbing me.
[63:18.12]It's definitely going to happen, like, right now.
[63:24.78]Oh, get by the train again.
[63:25.76]Oh, God.
[63:31.71]Oh, we won?
[63:32.35]How did we win?
[63:33.35]How am I in the number two right now?
[63:44.07]Alright, well, good night if you're leaving, man.
[63:45.88]Thanks for coming.
[63:47.64]So now I'm going to head on to tribes.
[63:50.40]Ascend time, dudes and dudettes.
[63:58.57]Thanks for playing, everybody.
[64:01.95]Alright.
[64:04.77]So I think I might invite a few people into the call that have tribes.
[64:12.78]Let's see how that goes.
[64:18.18]I gotta change this to Sam.
[64:19.46]Actually, I'll do that in a minute.
[64:21.76]Let me open up Tribes.
[64:22.58]The screen might go black for a second, guys.
[64:25.62]So, I apologize.
[64:26.80]The screen is going to go black.
[64:35.03]So, bear with me for one second.
[64:38.41]While I load up Tribes Ascend.
[64:42.79]Oh, I have ADHD crazy bad.
[64:46.31]I have really bad ADHD.
[64:50.73]Jerma is dead.
[64:52.27]I'm still here.
[64:55.11]Darkness, it's all I see.
[64:56.77]I already did a setup video, Hannibal.
[65:05.58]Go to my 4,000 subscriber video.
[65:07.90]It should be there.
[65:11.98]Don't go into the light.
[65:13.52]Now, my children, let me tell you something.
[65:17.45]I am God.
[65:18.91]Coming to you from the black screen, let me tell you, all you need to do to have a good, fun, interesting life is to crash, because that's what I think I just did.
[65:33.34]Oh, no, no, I'm here.
[65:34.40]Okay, hold on.
[65:36.92]I really thought I just hard crashed right there.
[65:38.56]That would have been bad.
[65:42.46]Alright, let me get into the game.
[65:45.66]Screen should come back in about...
[65:48.82]10 seconds, guys.
[65:52.92]Settings.
[65:55.02]Audio.
[65:55.84]Yeah, that's fine.
[65:57.78]Video!
[65:58.66]Window!
[65:59.32]Come on, let's go windowed.
[66:02.72]Alright.
[66:03.98]Now I'm coming back.
[66:07.24]Let's change the resolution.
[66:14.96]Alrighty.
[66:16.24]Let me just add this game as a source into XSplit.
[66:20.63]And we should be good to go.
[66:24.83]Game.
[66:25.79]Hello!
[66:28.69]Is that gonna fit?
[66:29.97]Does that work?
[66:30.75]Let's see.
[66:33.45]I think that fits.
[66:36.06]Pretty sure, at least.
[66:41.64]Get that out of the way.
[66:43.69]What's with the double screen?
[66:45.25]That's weird.
[66:50.14]Hmm.
[66:54.40]Hold on a second, guys.
[66:56.08]I'm going to change this.
[66:57.32]This is a little glitchy.
[66:58.32]I'm just going to add the screen region.
[67:04.94]That should be better.
[67:05.70]Okay, yeah, there we go.
[67:10.77]Alright, so that should be better.
[67:18.19]Alright, so I think we're going to get some people in here to talk while we play.
[67:29.02]Those of you that have never played this game, please, my goodness, please go download it.
[67:35.54]It is an unbelievable game, and it's free.
[67:39.48]What other reason do you need?
[67:42.68]Move this.
[67:44.66]It's not in the way.
[67:50.82]To the left, to the left, to the right, to the right.
[67:55.10]That needs to be moved a little bit.
[68:05.79]Alright.
[68:08.47]Looks like it's centered, at least on my screen.
[68:10.55]Alright.
[68:15.28]So are we going to get anybody in this call?
[68:20.42]Maybe.
[68:22.45]What happened to the audio?
[68:27.09]Audio still here?
[68:27.71]Yeah, it's here.
[68:29.21]I can hear it.
[68:31.99]Alright.
[68:33.25]Somebody call me on Skype so we can start a call.
[68:36.45]Boo or Stealth or Burgah Boy.
[68:39.51]Whichever one of you guys wants to do this thing and then just join off me.
[68:45.27]They might have already been calling.
[68:46.82]Yeah, they are.
[68:50.04]What up?
[68:50.72]Oh, what's up, Burgah Boy?
[68:53.12]Oh, Burgah Boy.
[68:53.66]Now Burgah Boy's calling me.
[68:54.76]Get out of here.
[68:55.80]Oh, inviting him on this one.
[68:58.53]What is that?
[68:58.87]Is Blue around?
[68:59.81]I was first.
[69:01.93]What about, uh, what about, where's Etalyx?
[69:04.19]Maybe Etalyx will play.
[69:05.17]He was offline.
[69:05.93]He might be doing a band thing right now.
[69:07.55]Oh, hey, everyone.
[69:08.95]Oh, what's up, Burgah Boy?
[69:13.65]Make sure you guys are turning up.
[69:14.63]I'm trying to turn the stream off.
[69:16.84]I did.
[69:18.46]Alright, if somebody else wants to join, can you guys monitor, or stealth, can you monitor, just in case I'm, like, in the game?
[69:24.88]Yeah, do it.
[69:25.94]What's happening?
[69:26.88]I'm just saying, like, when I alt-tab in a window, it just, like, like, explodes, so, like, I can't, like, really alt-tab anymore.
[69:37.47]But I want to play the game.
[69:39.05]I mean, you could play the game, just every, like, ten seconds, just check this...
[69:46.28]So if you want, it's going to be difficult to join the game off me right now because the way this game works is you have to have, like, I don't know how many friends you can have, to be honest.
[69:54.94]I really don't know.
[69:57.08]But I'm going to go Pathfinder.
[70:01.22]Turn this up.
[70:02.48]The stream is under control.
[70:04.44]Oh, it's spamming you.
[70:05.92]The stream is under control.
[70:07.16]Hold on, I've got to turn this up.
[70:09.22]Turn this up.
[70:11.00]Because you can't hear.
[70:13.02]Alright, let's go with sound on the stream.
[70:16.16]Should be.
[70:19.37]Oh, he's got it.
[70:22.03]He's absolutely got it.
[70:23.79]So this game, if you don't know what this is, if you're like, what the hell are you doing right now?
[70:29.03]This game is pretty much, think of Team Fortress meets Quake meets Skiing meets Ski Free meets Windows 95 meets Windows 98.
[70:40.14]I'm not sure if that made any sense, but this game is just, look at this, it's just chaos.
[70:44.48]Pretty much think of this game as you play as a soldier.
[70:46.90]Like a Liberty Launcher soldier, and that's pretty much what everyone is using.
[70:51.10]And you ski around like 100 miles per hour.
[70:53.00]It's all about momentum.
[70:54.81]And we just apparently won the game.
[70:58.37]Yeah, that's a good way to put it.
[70:59.29]This game is Halo with speed hacks and cooler mechanics, in my opinion.
[71:03.89]And the music is cool.
[71:14.98]I agree with what Jerma said.
[71:17.96]Alright, let's change.
[71:18.60]Let's change to go to a new map.
[71:23.06]But it's not really Halo.
[71:24.44]It's like a... It's cooler than Halo, in my opinion.
[71:28.73]Just because I never really played Halo.
[71:31.29]Because you never had an Xbox.
[71:32.63]You never could play Halo.
[71:34.19]I had an Xbox.
[71:34.85]I had a 360.
[71:35.03]When?
[71:35.17]Um...
[71:42.53]Two or three years ago was the last time I had one?
[71:45.85]Oh, what's going on?
[71:46.50]Why am I, like, stuck here?
[71:49.62]I'm, like, stuck in this, like, lobby area.
[71:53.56]Here we go.
[71:57.58]So it was lagging right there?
[71:58.56]The stream was lagging?
[72:00.64]You kidding me?
[72:07.89]Let me know if it keeps happening, guys.
[72:09.27]Let me try this again.
[72:13.74]If it keeps happening, I might restart it.
[72:17.58]Just change a couple settings.
[72:25.50]This game is so satisfying.
[72:26.70]I'm going Blood Eagle, by the way.
[72:29.93]You can get some real satisfying kills within this game.
[72:33.11]Especially because it's all about long range.
[72:34.91]Long range and people.
[72:35.87]It's awesome.
[72:37.15]Oh, did you quit and join a different game?
[72:38.85]I did.
[72:39.09]Just join off me.
[72:41.69]Oh, come on.
[72:44.58]Yeah, it like kicks me out.
[72:47.54]Oh, sure it did.
[72:51.82]Oh!
[72:52.94]Because Burgah Boy is like not allowed to play.
[72:58.34]How did I not kill that guy?
[72:59.40]There we go.
[73:01.24]This is a beta.
[73:01.98]This is a beta.
[73:09.14]Oh!
[73:10.70]There's another.
[73:11.24]Chill.
[73:12.78]It's free though.
[73:13.34]It's open.
[73:13.88]Open beta.
[73:15.21]Oh, he was in the air.
[73:15.89]Why didn't you probably Reserve Shooter and get that free crit?
[73:18.83]You get three shots.
[73:24.36]Pretty much when the Pathfinder is like the Scout, you move around really fast.
[73:29.30]Soldier is like the Soldier, I guess.
[73:33.69]There's like nine classes in this game.
[73:35.41]I'm pretty sure there is.
[73:37.09]This is just Team Deathmatch.
[73:38.67]And essentially... What the... Why do we... What the hell?
[73:43.72]I keep joining a game, we keep just winning.
[73:48.22]Alright, do not quit this one.
[73:51.86]Stay in this one.
[73:52.40]See this up here?
[73:57.56]This 2700 XP.
[73:58.62]Pretty much, if you don't want to buy the game,
[74:10.30]The game doesn't cost any money, but it's kind of like in Team Fortress where there's an economy where you can buy items if you don't want to wait and unlock them.
[74:18.22]It's kind of like that.
[74:19.84]So if you want to spend money, you can, but if you don't, it takes a long time to get all the items and all the classes and everything.
[74:26.06]And it's like an exaggerated long time.
[74:31.18]Yeah.
[74:33.34]Like 90 hours of game time to unlock items.
[74:38.07]You start with three classes when you just get the game free.
[74:42.40]You can spend 10, 20 bucks and you'll unlock everything pretty much.
[74:47.06]I'm going to go Blood Eagle.
[74:50.89]Pathfinder again.
[74:53.89]I'm going to turn the graphics down a tiny bit just because I think people were saying it was lagging.
[74:56.85]Oh, Burgah Boy!
[75:07.43]You just press escape?
[75:08.51]Yeah, you can escape and then switch teams.
[75:12.89]Oh, this guy's toast down here.
[75:14.97]This guy's toast, guys.
[75:17.39]Oh, get him!
[75:24.15]Direct shot.
[75:25.51]Finish this dude off.
[75:30.73]There it is.
[75:31.13]Alright.
[75:33.34]So as you can see,
[75:35.27]I got a shotgun.
[75:35.89]You pretty much only have two weapons.
[75:37.03]I have grenades, too, but I don't really use them.
[75:38.99]I mean, I know I should, but... And see the top, the middle top, 97-92?
[75:45.95]This is Team Deathmatch, and essentially how this works is when you die, one point gets taken off your side of the team, but if your team has the flag, or if their team has the flag, kills count as two.
[75:57.84]So we have the flag right now, so anytime we kill somebody on their team, it's going to count as two points taken down from their score.
[76:04.46]Oh, I just got nailed.
[76:09.61]So it's lagging, huh?
[76:11.67]Oh, let me see what the hell's going on here.
[76:13.59]Wasn't doing this on Team Fortress, was it?
[76:15.35]No, it wasn't.
[76:16.47]Let's find out what the hell is going on.
[76:18.61]It's too graphically demanding a stream.
[76:21.57]It shouldn't be.
[76:22.27]It shouldn't be.
[76:26.21]I'm watching.
[76:27.21]Oh, you're still on CT?
[76:30.89]Oh, yeah.
[76:31.37]I got the flag.
[76:32.13]Come get me.
[76:33.39]Okay.
[76:34.87]Oh, you're on the enemy team, huh?
[76:39.07]Come get me, okay.
[76:41.33]Destroy.
[76:44.49]Oh, come on.
[76:46.91]Let's go.
[76:47.23]1v1, baby.
[76:50.87]Oh, he got me.
[76:51.59]Damn, he got me.
[76:55.09]It looks okay on my end.
[76:56.50]When I'm watching the stream right now, it looks okay.
[77:00.06]Maybe it was just like a little issue.
[77:01.78]I don't know.
[77:02.22]Not sure.
[77:12.93]Yeah, look at all those people in that.
[77:15.21]Oh, I could play a sniper rifle.
[77:21.80]Yeah, but see, when you go down, look at the left and right of my screen.
[77:24.38]See how I have that, like, power meter?
[77:26.00]That's how fast I'm going when I ski.
[77:28.50]The entire time you're going to be holding down space, essentially, in this game.
[77:31.81]There's the flag.
[77:33.69]Alright.
[77:34.93]Time to pull off something.
[77:37.91]Oh, get him with an air shot.
[77:39.15]Come on, now.
[77:45.94]I didn't get that guy?
[77:50.66]Oh, kill the people.
[77:51.84]Go with the people going for the flag.
[77:53.42]We've got to get rid of these people.
[77:54.30]There we go.
[77:54.56]Alright.
[77:56.87]Pick up the flag.
[77:57.47]Pick up the flag.
[77:58.01]I got it.
[77:58.95]I got it.
[78:00.59]Oh, protect me.
[78:02.85]Oh, Etalyx is in this game.
[78:04.93]Drag him in the call.
[78:06.19]Ecclesiastes?
[78:06.99]Yeah.
[78:07.17]Drag Etalyx in here.
[78:10.15]That was you?
[78:10.57]I'm not even friends with him.
[78:15.50]I love my way in our friends on how it just blew me to hell that I blew him to hell room there we go look at all these people ready a grenade grenade but it's a lot in this game all this is a flag in the flag would like now that was that was a snipe flag right there
[78:45.80]I just totally sniped that flag.
[78:48.74]I'm losing momentum.
[78:49.58]Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.
[78:57.62]I tried the Sentinel before.
[78:58.68]I'm not very good at it.
[79:04.13]God, I'm being chased by like a mob of people.
[79:09.13]Well, press Z and all the people will start following you.
[79:11.71]What?
[79:13.03]I promise.
[79:13.69]Yeah, because I'm going to drop the flag.
[79:17.84]Still got it.
[79:19.80]Oh, maybe not anymore.
[79:21.82]Protect me still.
[79:23.68]Oh, they got me.
[79:26.43]Let me drag it, Alex, into here.
[79:27.47]Alright, he's coming.
[79:39.39]There it is.
[79:40.51]One more of those.
[79:43.23]One more of those.
[79:44.91]Oh, one more of those, baby.
[79:47.97]Hey guys, what is going on?
[79:50.07]What's up, man?
[79:51.15]What's up, Alex?
[79:52.01]Playing the flag, man, like I do.
[79:53.47]Yeah, we got some good flag control.
[79:59.78]Too bad, like, Burgah Boy's, like, terrible at this game.
[80:01.66]He could, like, he could, like, really, like, do something right now.
[80:05.74]Can't even figure out how to switch teams.
[80:09.15]Hit escape.
[80:11.07]And then what?
[80:12.29]And then go to, uh, change, um... I don't want to be on this team anymore.
[80:18.40]Oh, I think MLC_St3alth just lied to you.
[80:21.36]Yeah.
[80:23.01]No, that's absolutely true.
[80:24.23]I just did it.
[80:25.29]Oh, wait, you pressed P. Awesome.
[80:27.59]P?
[80:27.95]That's what I meant to say.
[80:28.75]Okay, P. Oh, I can't.
[80:31.77]There's not enough people on that team.
[80:35.73]Oh, this guy is so toast right now.
[80:37.91]Oh, here we go.
[80:38.87]Oh, well, why can't he switch?
[80:42.90]Oh, come on.
[80:43.70]Get him with those shots.
[80:48.23]Oh, fine, whatever, I'll go with this thing.
[80:53.11]There's just a swarm of red upside-down triangles around that flag.
[80:57.63]Oh, stealth, you've got the flag, alright.
[80:59.01]I sure do.
[81:00.17]Alright, let's do a little bit of teamwork here.
[81:06.92]I'm a pro skier, watch how I go.
[81:08.64]Yeah, if we're still playing already, definitely, I'll get you in here.
[81:13.24]Oh, there's Burgah Boy.
[81:14.72]Oh, Burgah Boy.
[81:15.24]Where are you?
[81:18.82]Yeah.
[81:20.38]Very good boy.
[81:21.95]I'll switch it.
[81:28.61]I think the teams are even.
[81:30.41]Oh, no, yeah.
[81:31.73]Not yet.
[81:32.63]It depends on the auto-balance moves, I guess.
[81:35.11]Yeah.
[81:37.61]Well, this game's almost over.
[81:38.61]We're almost going to lose.
[81:39.85]Oh, but I have a flag.
[81:42.00]That's good.
[81:42.34]That means we're going to win.
[81:43.74]Alright, so do not die.
[81:44.78]Nobody die, and we might win.
[81:47.68]No, we won't.
[81:48.56]That's going to be a long range.
[81:53.13]I'm going to get rid of this guy.
[81:55.15]Got him.
[81:56.51]MLC, you were flying around the map right now.
[81:58.65]I've been chasing you for so long.
[82:00.75]I'm like shooting Burgah Boy from behind.
[82:03.79]He's just like right behind me.
[82:06.78]Oh, watch out.
[82:07.34]Burgah Boy is going to take us all on.
[82:09.74]Somebody took him out.
[82:10.50]I don't know who.
[82:11.06]I got an assist.
[82:13.18]Burgah Boy.
[82:15.70]I can't even catch up with Stealth, and I'm on his team.
[82:18.12]I know, really, right?
[82:20.64]Spams.
[82:21.56]Rocket Spams.
[82:23.54]Oh, we lost.
[82:24.71]Try and get on this team.
[82:28.35]Try and get on this team, Burgah Boy, the insensitive one.
[82:31.51]Alright.
[82:34.39]Let's see if any of us made it into the MVP statistics.
[82:36.84]No, we sure didn't.
[82:38.28]Yeah, you got MLC_St3alth flag held.
[82:41.18]Top accolade.
[82:42.46]Whoa.
[82:43.64]You got like a top medal.
[82:45.29]You didn't get a MVP.
[82:49.39]Actually, you got two.
[82:50.49]You got two medals.
[82:53.29]Flag held and flag killer.
[82:56.29]Top accolades.
[82:58.73]My most flag held medals is 41.
[83:00.55]And that's because I got the flag right when the game started and I skied around for 10 minutes and didn't get hit.
[83:05.81]I didn't kill anybody either.
[83:07.07]Why am I not logged into my own stream right now?
[83:09.91]I just typed something.
[83:11.40]How is that possible?
[83:17.11]Oh, playing Teen Fortress 2, when I'm absolutely not.
[83:22.27]People might believe you.
[83:23.73]What are you doing, Blood Eagle?
[83:27.90]Uh, yeah, go right when you can.
[83:31.52]Is that Burgah Boy just, like, click-spamming?
[83:33.90]Yeah, I'm trying to get in that Blood Eagle.
[83:37.61]That was your best chance.
[83:39.19]Oh, no.
[83:40.07]Oh, no.
[83:42.15]Are we going to get split up here?
[83:44.72]I think we might get split up here.
[83:47.26]Whatever.
[83:48.20]I'll catch you guys.
[83:49.76]Oh, I just made it.
[83:51.52]Oh, Burgah Boy.
[83:55.64]You could have still gotten up.
[83:57.08]You made it?
[83:58.84]Oh, you made it.
[84:02.63]Enemy has a flag.
[84:03.59]I'm going to change this to say I'm playing tribes.
[84:06.09]Alright, descend.
[84:11.16]There we go.
[84:14.32]Broadcast updated successfully.
[84:15.96]Uh-oh, got the flag.
[84:20.64]Probably not for long.
[84:22.32]I'm going to go soldier this time.
[84:27.08]I think that's the best idea.
[84:29.71]Wow, there is no one on my team over here at all.
[84:33.01]Try and Etalyx.
[84:33.95]They're all behind you.
[84:34.55]Oh, nice air shot.
[84:35.65]I'll bring one right in on the thing.
[84:39.05]Oh, yeah.
[84:39.93]Oh, Burgah Boy made it?
[84:40.75]That's good.
[84:42.19]Alright, let's keep going.
[84:43.45]Alright, I got some speed now.
[84:44.87]I got killed by an Arcs Buster, whatever that is.
[84:49.40]It's probably stupid.
[84:52.58]Oh, you bastard.
[84:53.28]What are you doing?
[84:55.18]Oh, that was a sweep under the bridge.
[84:57.78]Flight right there.
[84:59.46]Oh, you want to go assault rifle on assault rifle or something?
[85:03.35]Oh, yeah.
[85:04.89]Oh, this guy needs one hit and he's dead.
[85:09.17]Oh, come on.
[85:09.81]Fine.
[85:10.07]Thump him.
[85:11.69]There we go.
[85:13.11]There we go.
[85:16.89]Alright.
[85:17.23]We got the flag good.
[85:17.89]Uh-oh.
[85:18.29]Uh-oh.
[85:19.07]They're going to catch me now.
[85:19.93]I ran into, like, the border.
[85:20.99]I'm, like, at the edge of the map over here.
[85:23.51]Do we get the Flawgistinator flag?
[85:25.47]Yeah, we do.
[85:26.25]And, yeah, Etalyx has two evil men chasing him.
[85:28.63]Alright.
[85:29.19]Let's get over there.
[85:30.24]Got some ninjas flying around behind me trying to kill me.
[85:32.16]I feel one dude chasing him.
[85:33.86]Oh, Etalyx's voice is smooth.
[85:35.80]It is.
[85:37.31]Somebody just said that.
[85:38.31]Smooth like an erection.
[85:39.95]Hey, this is a PG-13 stream.
[85:45.84]I don't even know what that meant.
[85:47.52]I was about to ask.
[85:51.24]Oh, air shot.
[85:51.86]No.
[85:52.74]That guy just got me.
[85:54.56]This thing doesn't go very far.
[85:55.44]I forget that sometimes.
[85:57.36]I'm just going to do a lapse of the map right now.
[85:59.52]I'm doing a lapse right behind you.
[86:02.05]Where is he?
[86:02.75]Oh, God!
[86:03.31]Not enough jetpack.
[86:10.00]I'm trying to prove I'm a better skier.
[86:12.14]Well, the classes have a lot of impact on that as well.
[86:14.48]What class are you?
[86:16.38]Yeah, you're like the fastest class.
[86:18.22]What are you?
[86:19.60]I am a raider.
[86:20.21]There's somebody behind you, so I'll slow down a little bit and do them.
[86:25.37]This game, the person that just asked, this game is free.
[86:29.11]And it's in open beta.
[86:30.45]You can just play it.
[86:31.15]You can play it as much as you want.
[86:33.68]Whenever you want.
[86:36.82]And it's a game about skiing, momentum, and fun.
[86:40.49]It's a ski simulation game.
[86:42.41]Yes.
[86:43.57]Oh, this guy's smart.
[86:44.85]What do I do with a smart guy?
[86:46.07]Wait till he lands.
[86:50.07]I can't believe I've been carrying the flag this entire time.
[86:52.81]I really can't.
[86:55.63]We're taking care of their team here.
[86:58.01]Ah!
[86:58.91]Son of a... Uh-oh.
[87:02.69]Are we gonna get to see some real raw Burgah Boy rage?
[87:07.36]Remember, Burgah Boy, you can't say any, like, wicked horrible swear words.
[87:17.35]Uh-oh, I'm about to run into a wall.
[87:19.03]Oh, I ran into a wall.
[87:20.07]It's over.
[87:21.85]I see you, John.
[87:23.71]I'm dead here.
[87:25.73]This is on me.
[87:26.53]Dead.
[87:27.33]Oh, you want to go with this?
[87:28.69]Boom.
[87:29.85]Oh, nice, nice, nice.
[87:30.97]It was a good run.
[87:34.75]Very nice, very nice.
[87:37.17]Burgah Boy's in first place.
[87:38.99]Burgah Boy, there you go.
[87:40.73]Oh, yeah.
[87:41.21]Somebody get that flag.
[87:41.97]One of our guys got the flag.
[87:42.93]Oh, come on.
[87:48.63]Gotta get better aim.
[87:49.99]Come on, land.
[87:51.47]Oh, I got no ammo on this thing.
[87:52.45]What am I doing?
[87:56.12]Ah, I gotta get to an ammo supply.
[88:00.86]Ah, damn.
[88:02.16]Not doing so well right this second.
[88:04.94]Ah, that's not... Not doing so hot right there.
[88:08.34]I just grenaded myself.
[88:11.85]Like, as fast as you move in this game, that is nearly impossible.
[88:16.33]Yeah, I know, right?
[88:16.99]That's crazy.
[88:19.22]I got that guy on a couple of shots.
[88:20.72]Oh, jetpack, give me some speed.
[88:26.44]I'll get this guy.
[88:28.08]I'll thump this guy.
[88:28.90]Oh, tumble is better than thumpus.
[88:30.58]Tumble is better than thumpus.
[88:34.05]No, not high enough.
[88:35.17]Wait, the flag has dropped.
[88:36.17]I had the flag on my back.
[88:37.57]Get it, Etalyx.
[88:38.25]I got it.
[88:39.11]I blew that guy away from you guys.
[88:40.39]Nice.
[88:40.79]Alright, protect Etalyx.
[88:44.27]Or I could just sit down here alone by myself like an idiot.
[88:50.18]Let's go with this.
[88:54.28]Oh, I just got air shot.
[88:56.54]Damn.
[88:59.41]Oh, losing momentum here.
[89:02.79]I just got mad air shot.
[89:06.19]I'm dead.
[89:08.47]I don't know how I dropped these.
[89:14.45]I believe there are some grenades that can make you drop stuff, like the flag.
[89:21.88]on that.
[89:22.76]Ah, damn it.
[89:24.05]I gotta get more.
[89:24.65]I gotta... Oh!
[89:27.97]This guy's done.
[89:30.01]Out of town!
[89:32.41]Back off.
[89:40.70]Just got killed by a blue fatty.
[89:42.62]Somebody just said.
[89:44.78]Juggernaut?
[89:45.24]Yeah, that's a juggernaut probably.
[89:49.66]I might want to pull out the... No, I might kill him.
[89:52.24]One more shot.
[89:52.78]Come on.
[89:53.06]This is the one.
[89:53.48]This is the one right here.
[89:55.50]Oh, no!
[89:55.98]He's not dead!
[89:56.66]Oh, here we go.
[90:00.06]I need to go to resupply big time.
[90:04.43]Oh, Shibby's got a new video.
[90:05.57]Reserve Shooter.
[90:07.01]Sick.
[90:07.45]He has like a challenge.
[90:10.39]Oh, he's got a challenge?
[90:12.37]Oh, yeah.
[90:13.17]Flag down, baby.
[90:18.47]Shibby.
[90:20.50]Alright, we're beating them by, like, we have, like, a 100% lead on them right now.
[90:25.08]Get this guy off.
[90:31.61]Trying to get, like, hit markers on him.
[90:35.31]But, man, I tell you right now, this game is a lot of fun.
[90:41.39]I probably wouldn't have even started playing this game if it was not for Etalyx.
[90:45.05]Thank you, sir.
[90:45.73]Thank you.
[90:46.41]I was like, you've got to play this game.
[90:48.35]He's like, eh.
[90:49.87]Whatever.
[90:50.33]I was like, I'll give it a try, whatever.
[90:51.99]It probably sucks.
[90:53.25]No.
[90:53.95]This game is very, very good.
[90:57.57]I saw it before a long time ago, like months ago, when people first started talking about it.
[91:02.10]And I was like, eh, it looks okay, but this game is very addicting and very fun.
[91:07.40]Somebody's behind me, but I don't care to turn around.
[91:09.84]And it's free.
[91:10.74]Yeah.
[91:12.34]That's a huge plus right there.
[91:14.55]I usually don't buy games that are like ten bucks, so...
[91:19.42]Yeah, Burgah Boy doesn't buy video games until they are $10.
[91:22.04]And we're talking like Skyrim, but it's like, dude, you're never going to get that game.
[91:28.04]Yeah, you're going to get Skyrim when you're like 35.
[91:31.80]Is it $10 yet?
[91:33.82]Is it $10 yet?
[91:38.61]That's always the Burgah Boy quote.
[91:40.49]I'll be like, oh, hey, dude, you know, like Diablo 3 just came out.
[91:43.03]$10 yet?
[91:43.81]Like, no, it's not.
[91:46.67]It's like $60.
[91:48.56]Oh, well, I'm fine until it's like 10 bucks.
[91:53.13]I'm going to try and help you with this dude.
[91:55.51]Nice.
[91:55.93]Yep.
[91:56.69]He was getting on you pretty good.
[91:58.33]Yeah.
[91:59.81]Hey, he's just 13, I thought.
[92:03.45]Yeah, alright, let me know when you're ready.
[92:04.99]Alright, that was a joke.
[92:05.65]Nobody was saved.
[92:07.45]Wait, what did you just say?
[92:09.58]I really just didn't even pay attention to a word you said.
[92:12.28]Oh, I need to get up here.
[92:13.74]I'm dead.
[92:14.46]I'm so dead.
[92:15.12]Yeah, absolutely.
[92:17.99]Oh, top fragging like a mouse.
[92:19.21]I got the guy for you.
[92:20.37]Got the guy for you.
[92:22.13]Nice.
[92:22.51]Let's see if I can get a slide carrier with this airstrike.
[92:27.20]Let's see if he walks right into it.
[92:29.22]Oh, no.
[92:30.04]He almost got him.
[92:30.92]He was in the air.
[92:32.02]He was in the air.
[92:33.02]At least it looked close from over here.
[92:34.30]I'm trying to get him in the air.
[92:38.87]I'm not shooting far enough ahead of him.
[92:44.97]No, still not shooting far enough ahead of him.
[92:48.22]Oh, that could have been an air shot.
[92:49.40]Come on, now.
[92:51.48]Mother may I. I don't know.
[92:54.84]Alright, I need to wait.
[92:59.18]I got to recharge my stuff here.
[93:01.48]Oh, God.
[93:03.68]There we go.
[93:10.86]Alright, let's get Ari in here.
[93:18.26]First one of the day.
[93:20.10]There he is.
[93:22.20]Oh, Burgah Boy, that's 12 kills.
[93:23.74]Holy crap.
[93:25.02]Did Burgah Boy, nice.
[93:28.38]I would not buy Team Fortress Classic.
[93:30.38]The only reason why I say that is because it's just, it's very, and now it's just so difficult to play.
[93:37.02]This grenade spam is, it's, unless it's like $5, don't buy it.
[93:42.26]I'll put it that way.
[93:47.91]Winner, winner, chicken dinner.
[93:49.65]I think this is the first time I've ever gotten first place in anything in Shrives.
[93:54.45]Oh, really?
[93:58.23]That is an achievement in and of itself for me.
[94:05.28]Not even first in the whole game.
[94:06.54]Just first in my team.
[94:07.64]That's good enough.
[94:08.30]Alright, quick.
[94:08.78]Blood Eagle.
[94:10.04]Blood Eagle.
[94:11.08]Everybody click.
[94:12.00]Click it.
[94:13.82]Yes.
[94:15.26]Go back to Pathfinder.
[94:19.85]Oh, there's a guy right here.
[94:22.61]Air shot.
[94:23.05]Nope.
[94:23.89]Get the first kill.
[94:24.73]That gives you that flag gap.
[94:27.33]It does?
[94:28.42]Yep.
[94:29.12]Oh.
[94:29.48]It's like Team Defender on Call of Duty.
[94:30.84]You've never played Team Defender on Call of Duty?
[94:32.84]Hey.
[94:34.38]Watch it.
[94:37.18]I can't believe I didn't... Oh, he's gonna kill me.
[94:38.58]No, Germany, you have to be the first kill, not first death.
[94:40.84]I'm gonna be the first death if I don't get Lord Chaos.
[94:43.56]I'm the first damn death.
[94:45.86]Wow, that was the luckiest kill I've ever had.
[94:48.66]Yeah, I'll probably do videos for Tribes.
[94:50.90]Eventually here.
[94:51.64]I gotta get familiar with it, get good at it.
[94:54.82]But I'll probably do a few videos at least.
[94:56.18]Yep.
[94:59.24]Because this game is really awesome.
[95:05.25]Boom.
[95:05.53]Where am I?
[95:06.15]I'm going the absolute wrong direction.
[95:08.37]Alright.
[95:10.69]Gonna get some speed here.
[95:13.23]Picking up speed.
[95:13.93]Picking up speed.
[95:16.19]Got him.
[95:17.53]And then someone got me.
[95:18.94]Oh, we gotta get that flag.
[95:20.53]Got it.
[95:21.03]Somebody on our team got it.
[95:22.91]MLC_St3alth is gonna die.
[95:29.41]Look at that chaos.
[95:30.17]Grenade into the chaos.
[95:33.30]Oh, I thought I got that guy.
[95:38.38]My game is just updating.
[95:40.12]It's doing some really weird stuff right now.
[95:43.79]Hey, when we installed it on Burgah Boy's computer, all his fans turned on.
[95:48.56]His computer almost, like, broke.
[95:50.94]It exploded just randomly.
[95:52.02]I wouldn't be surprised.
[95:53.12]Yeah, this, like, awesome computer I have.
[95:56.91]Nice shot.
[95:58.97]That guy got a really good shot.
[96:00.65]We've had issues with Borderlands, Burgah Boy.
[96:02.91]We've had issues.
[96:05.30]Burgah Boy, Borderlands.
[96:07.83]So, like, Ari, how many times have you heard Burgah Boy, like, swear and say horrible things in Borderlands?
[96:13.03]Oh, oh, God.
[96:14.48]Basically, he didn't remap his keys for his special ability, and every time we wanted to pick up an item, he decided to activate his special ability.
[96:23.62]And playing his brick, he was just screaming constantly for the entire three hours that we played at a time.
[96:31.30]Worst tank ever.
[96:33.80]Burgah Boy, come on.
[96:34.64]You can, like, do better than that.
[96:40.87]Oh, let's go, Shotty.
[96:41.63]I don't have any momentum.
[96:44.45]I'm, like, walking around the map.
[96:46.52]Ah, I got that guy.
[96:49.36]Oh, I still have.
[96:52.10]Okay.
[96:52.74]I'm going to waste this grenade.
[96:55.04]Let's get this guy.
[96:56.34]Double team.
[97:00.28]Oh, I missed.
[97:03.33]There we go.
[97:04.29]Another guy right there.
[97:08.79]Two guys.
[97:11.69]770, that's a direct shot.
[97:14.77]Oh, that guy fell in the lava.
[97:18.09]Oh, he knew... Wow, that was awesome.
[97:20.69]Come here, flag boy.
[97:23.49]Holy crap, that was awesome.
[97:25.71]Yes.
[97:26.71]I just tried to get a resupply, and a guy threw a grenade right into my feet when I went over there and got me.
[97:33.54]Touché, my friend.
[97:34.64]That was great.
[97:35.22]Damn.
[97:39.76]Down.
[97:42.50]So Jeremy, what classes do you have unlocked so far?
[97:49.98]Just the sniper, Sentinel.
[97:52.86]The nice thing about, like yesterday, we were talking about the ones that don't detonate on impact.
[97:59.05]They bounce around.
[98:00.57]I have the grenade launcher right now, and I've noticed that if you get a direct hit, it's like the Demoman, you know, it'll just explode.
[98:05.54]It'll just pop.
[98:06.60]Oh, really?
[98:07.18]Immediately.
[98:09.05]Wow.
[98:09.97]And the nice thing about them also is that they usually do a lot more damage and have a bigger radius than, like, the Spinfusers.
[98:17.39]Yeah, I've noticed the explosions are huge.
[98:19.77]You just get a massive damage spike right there.
[98:23.35]I'm going in the lava.
[98:24.29]I keep falling in the lava like an idiot.
[98:28.13]Hey, stop running.
[98:31.23]I can't help it.
[98:33.65]Does anybody else feel like they're playing, like, Star Wars?
[98:37.01]Or we are on, like, that map.
[98:39.78]What's that map called?
[98:40.50]I don't know.
[98:41.14]I mean, even the noise is like the... I feel like the... It sounds like Star Wars.
[98:49.26]Oh, dang it.
[98:50.66]So what are you guys' favorite classes for the game so far?
[98:53.79]I like moving fast and having zero health.
[98:56.15]Pathfinder.
[98:57.57]Yeah, I'd probably say the Pathfinder, too.
[99:01.83]just get the shot the shot gonna sell it to break the trend like that right now and I would say a rater or infiltrator see I mean I gotta get those guys I'm not very good with the infiltrator yet never been good with the stealthy classes in any game but it's still fun yeah so what you can you can cloak oh yeah you can cloak
[99:24.67]And instead of using your energy for your jetpack, it'll use it for your stealth.
[99:29.35]Oh, okay.
[99:29.85]That's a good trade-off.
[99:31.01]That's not, like, overpowered or anything.
[99:32.25]That's cool.
[99:33.53]And there's a few items and, like, perks.
[99:35.53]Maybe not perks, but I know there's at least one or two items that can, like, detect stealth people.
[99:42.26]Oh, really?
[99:42.94]I don't have any of those yet.
[99:43.84]There's a lot of people here.
[99:45.66]I'm so dead.
[99:46.52]Yeah, there's, like, ten people around me.
[99:53.67]Skate down here.
[99:55.43]Oh, Tony Hawk presents Tribe's Ascent.
[100:00.28]Do a kickflip.
[100:03.36]I'm going to do like a shaky 200.
[100:04.34]Oh, that's like 25 points.
[100:05.42]Alright, I've got to get some speed.
[100:10.50]Yeah, I cannot catch up to the flag carrier.
[100:14.08]Oh, shut down history.
[100:15.61]I'll try and cut him off.
[100:17.57]Hey, Burgah Boy, your phone.
[100:19.25]How did you know it was him?
[100:21.71]I didn't know you were at that.
[100:24.97]Hey, call me right back.
[100:25.55]I'm in, like, a stream.
[100:28.33]I know Jermo's ringtone, and I'm pretty sure Burgah Boy's the only one who's going to have his phone on him right now.
[100:34.85]What if Vitalik has his phone on him?
[100:36.77]I didn't think he would.
[100:38.19]I thought that was more of a Burgah Boy thing to have his phone on him.
[100:42.39]What that means about you, I don't know.
[100:43.83]Give me that.
[100:44.25]Give me that.
[100:45.21]Oh, yeah, I got the flag.
[100:48.22]Hey, we're losing.
[100:49.62]Yeah, I got the flag.
[100:50.40]Just protect me.
[100:52.06]I'll do what I want when I want.
[100:55.09]I'm going to lose speed right now.
[100:56.37]I'm going to be sitting duck in two seconds.
[100:57.79]I'm going to be your body shield.
[100:59.95]I'm going to take the bullets.
[101:02.23]Oh my god, there's a whole crew just following you.
[101:05.52]Did I kill that guy?
[101:07.50]Finally, jeez.
[101:11.18]Oh my god.
[101:12.12]Oh yeah, I got one of them for you.
[101:13.62]Oh, I'm dead.
[101:14.46]I got a kill though.
[101:19.14]Come on.
[101:20.58]I got another kill?
[101:23.08]I picked it up and I died.
[101:24.92]Oh, I'm going to land right on top of everybody that's right there.
[101:28.52]Oh, no.
[101:30.00]Give me that flag.
[101:30.56]Oh, I ran right by it.
[101:33.46]Oh, no.
[101:34.74]Oh, that bastard got it.
[101:36.02]No.
[101:39.61]No, get the shotgun up.
[101:41.47]Oh.
[101:43.93]Damn.
[101:44.47]Best weapon in this game.
[101:46.29]Yeah, I didn't pull it out early enough.
[101:47.63]I should have pulled it out way earlier.
[101:50.05]Oh, Etalyx don't die.
[101:51.49]I got him.
[101:52.05]I got him, man.
[101:53.25]Almost died.
[101:54.46]I have 13 health.
[101:57.96]My streak!
[102:00.36]I'm not saying you're destroying.
[102:06.44]16 kills, man.
[102:07.20]I think I just blew that guy's grenade up in mid-air in front of him.
[102:10.30]I think that's actually what just happened.
[102:13.42]Where is the flag?
[102:14.54]I don't know.
[102:14.84]We don't have it, though.
[102:16.70]It's a pretty close game right now.
[102:18.66]I can't lose this.
[102:21.40]Oh, I just totally stole that from you, Burgah Boy.
[102:24.16]Melee is so tough, but so satisfying when you get it.
[102:29.73]I only do it on AFK people, or like snipers.
[102:33.01]Especially when you're an infiltrator.
[102:34.57]Are there hats in this game?
[102:38.95]I don't think so.
[102:40.97]Don't put it past them, man.
[102:42.23]This game could have a lot of items in the coming future.
[102:47.25]I got the flag guy.
[102:50.21]Alright.
[102:50.67]You got the flag?
[102:51.71]We're going to lose.
[102:53.36]We're absolutely going to lose.
[102:56.66]Try and cut this flag guy off.
[102:58.42]Yeah, we're going to lose.
[103:00.26]It's a done deal.
[103:01.32]Cut him off.
[103:03.00]It's not over yet, guys.
[103:05.30]That guy's out of speed.
[103:06.16]That guy's out of speed.
[103:08.07]7 to 24.
[103:08.81]I think it's over.
[103:09.45]5.
[103:10.25]Not yet.
[103:14.29]Oh, yeah.
[103:14.61]It's absolutely over.
[103:15.61]Somebody call in the nuke.
[103:17.65]Oh, man.
[103:19.91]I had 10,000 credits, but I called in an inventory station instead.
[103:22.99]MLC has killed me 15 times in a row.
[103:25.45]That's what he said.
[103:28.31]I feel like a retard.
[103:29.52]I was supposed to call in an orbital strike, but I called in the inventory station.
[103:33.00]It's alright.
[103:33.28]Does nobody die?
[103:34.72]Give me that flag!
[103:37.74]No!
[103:42.37]Alright, I think probably one more round, maybe?
[103:46.10]Do you guys want to play CTF?
[103:47.66]Or just keep doing this?
[103:51.16]CTF can be very, very long, so let's do one more of this.
[103:56.87]Are you in here yet, Ari?
[103:58.45]Is your game loaded?
[104:00.73]45 seconds, apparently.
[104:03.59]He says 20 minutes ago.
[104:04.89]Well, no worries.
[104:09.08]I got this game when beta first was announced for this.
[104:11.60]I signed
[104:14.09]signed up for like years ago.
[104:15.91]And 5.4 is incredible.
[104:19.90]I got the beta for that as well.
[104:21.50]Oh, I'm so jealous.
[104:24.04]It's only two times a week, though.
[104:26.00]You can only go on in those two periods, one for Europe and one for US.
[104:29.54]But it is insane.
[104:31.41]It's looking like an incredible game if you get a chance to get it.
[104:34.51]What is 5.4?
[104:35.21]What is it?
[104:37.41]It's another free-to-play game coming out.
[104:39.99]And it was
[104:50.72]Firefall.
[104:51.50]Oh, I thought someone said 5-4.
[104:55.28]That's what I did just say.
[104:56.96]Oh, okay.
[104:57.93]When are you going to get 5-4-3-2-1?
[105:00.13]It burns you and then fall, as in falling.
[105:04.19]Sorry, the English accent probably doesn't come across great.
[105:07.59]Well, no, I'm just an idiot, so.
[105:09.79]Firefall is like, okay, imagine... Oh, Firefall.
[105:12.69]We played that at PAX East last year.
[105:15.88]Yeah, that's the one.
[105:18.61]5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[105:22.22]It looks like Borderlands with an MMO and then open world and then awesome art style.
[105:29.14]The art style is absolutely beautiful.
[105:31.86]It's one of the most stunning games I've seen in beta.
[105:34.79]It looks good as it is.
[105:37.35]Yeah, right.
[105:38.05]That's cool.
[105:38.39]Oh, this guy's going to land on that.
[105:41.51]No, he's not.
[105:43.63]Get plastered.
[105:45.43]Come on.
[105:49.99]Oh, yeah.
[105:52.31]Oh, why am I shooting?
[105:54.77]I'm going after this dude down here.
[106:00.31]I'm playing Juggernaut.
[106:01.22]I'm not good with Juggernaut.
[106:04.30]I'm okay.
[106:05.12]I've got to get better with him.
[106:12.66]Oh, come on.
[106:13.22]Walk into that.
[106:15.44]this guy is standing still.
[106:17.08]Oh, I just saw that guy in mid-air with the grenade.
[106:21.84]Did anyone else see that?
[106:23.08]Yeah, I did.
[106:23.79]I was watching him come out.
[106:25.47]I was like 15 feet above the guy.
[106:27.85]I just like looked in front of him and just like popped the grenade right on his back.
[106:33.27]And he dropped the flag.
[106:34.17]That was amazing.
[106:35.37]That guy changed him right behind you, Etalyx.
[106:38.94]Oh, he's dead now.
[106:40.02]Somebody behind me now, I think.
[106:42.98]This AFK guy?
[106:44.55]Get him?
[106:45.01]Oh, he's not AFK anymore, is he?
[106:47.72]Oh, no, he's AFK.
[106:48.54]Melee!
[106:51.46]Oh, boy.
[106:53.88]Come on, land, land!
[106:55.84]Oh, nice shot, dude.
[106:57.76]It's like a ballet of death right there, Jerma.
[107:03.04]Jerma, I'm being shized.
[107:04.92]I'm dead, there's nothing I can do about it.
[107:06.74]You're right next to me.
[107:08.10]What?
[107:09.18]Oh, well, where is he?
[107:11.14]Oh, okay.
[107:11.32]I need to add you guys to my friends list so I can see you.
[107:13.24]So we can see, like, names.
[107:14.10]I know.
[107:14.38]Yeah.
[107:16.84]I'm trying to get him to walk into this grenade.
[107:18.64]Oh, he's going too fast.
[107:23.08]Where'd he go?
[107:23.44]I just launched him somewhere.
[107:25.46]Great.
[107:25.74]Where the hell is he?
[107:27.16]Oh, of course.
[107:27.92]He's right next to me.
[107:28.62]You've got, like, two people behind you, Jerma.
[107:30.16]Yeah, I'm trying to go for the suppressing.
[107:34.43]Oh, I'm stuck.
[107:35.31]I'm stuck.
[107:35.71]I'm gonna die.
[107:36.17]I'm so dead.
[107:36.67]I'm, like, on the ground.
[107:39.25]No, no, you still got it, you still got it.
[107:42.59]Oh, my God.
[107:43.81]Oh, you just saved my life right there.
[107:47.15]What's my graphics card?
[107:48.67]I use a GTX 470.
[107:50.77]In video.
[107:54.71]It's good.
[107:55.35]I wouldn't really recommend, if you're going to get a new graphics card, don't get the 400 series.
[107:59.25]Because the 400 series, at least the 470 and the 480, they heat up way too much.
[108:05.75]They are not recommended.
[108:07.09]They're very, they're good cards.
[108:09.51]but they can get to be like 80, 90 degrees Celsius, and it's not really that good for your computer.
[108:22.29]York, I did play Global Agenda.
[108:24.89]I have something like 700 hours, I think, clocked in on that game.
[108:30.03]On Global Agenda?
[108:31.53]Yeah, oh god, I used to play, both me and Zeus used to play like seriously like two years ago.
[108:38.19]Global Agenda is a different, I thought you meant Global Offensive.
[108:41.39]No, no, Global Agenda.
[108:42.89]That was before it was free.
[108:44.65]Like we bought it and we played it and oh god, like we put in hours into that game and then it all kind of went downhill after a while when they went free and they built Tribes Ascend instead.
[108:55.87]They took all their money out of Global Agenda and put it into Tribes instead.
[109:00.59]So, yeah.
[109:02.65]And that's cool.
[109:03.81]What was Global Agenda?
[109:04.67]Was it like a similar game?
[109:06.39]Third person shooter.
[109:08.31]Yeah, it was third person.
[109:09.55]Then you could also get into first person when you aim down sight and things like that.
[109:13.55]It was a really good concept, just it needed to be made by a bigger company, if that makes sense.
[109:19.29]Yeah, it does.
[109:21.81]Like APB, I guess.
[109:22.91]APB could have been... Auto-balance, don't die.
[109:24.63]I don't know how to... APB went into...
[109:29.51]like, the crapper, didn't it?
[109:31.51]Because, like, they rented the money or something?
[109:33.51]Oh, yeah, they were in so much debt in the end, EA was just like, oh, free game, we'll buy you.
[109:38.73]They just made it free for everybody.
[109:40.87]It just went downhill from then on in.
[109:42.75]Yeah, there is no health kit, by the way.
[109:45.49]There is no health kits in this game.
[109:51.84]Oh, shit, so...
[109:58.22]I think we're going to win, absolutely, by the way.
[110:00.48]I've had the flag the entire game.
[110:01.73]That guy's just pummeling me with this.
[110:04.75]Give me a shot.
[110:11.93]That's a sniper coming at me.
[110:13.29]Oh, that was beautiful.
[110:16.63]Air rocket shot.
[110:17.93]Gorgeous.
[110:19.57]Gorgeous.
[110:20.27]Yeah, this guy's... Let's get him.
[110:23.78]Here we go.
[110:24.28]Nice.
[110:25.18]Yeah, buddy.
[110:27.28]Oh, I got it.
[110:28.64]If I don't need it, I just... Ooh, that was an air shot.
[110:31.59]That was a pretty close air shot, though.
[110:34.31]I don't know if I would really count that.
[110:36.43]I have to get some more ammo and come back to fight.
[110:42.15]Oh, damn.
[110:44.67]I got a four-core quad-core.
[110:46.57]Four cores.
[110:52.99]Ha ha ha ha ha!
[110:57.37]Well, that was interesting, I guess, what I just did.
[111:04.45]The Spinfuser.
[111:06.29]Are you still carrying the flag, MLC?
[111:07.62]Mm-hmm.
[111:08.88]Yeah, this guy just walked right, he just, like, flew right by you.
[111:11.58]He's like, eh, whatever, I'm gonna, I'm gonna chase you.
[111:14.84]Actually, I'm gonna come back to you.
[111:17.26]Are you, are you alright?
[111:18.08]Are you dead?
[111:18.52]What are you doing still?
[111:20.16]Oh, no, I'm, yeah, I've, probably my fourth map around the map.
[111:25.77]Oh, you got people on you now.
[111:28.83]Oh, did they finally figure out how this game was played?
[111:32.03]If I could not be such a slug, I would come over there.
[111:38.44]Juggernaut, why do you forsake me?
[111:42.88]Oh, you're a juggernaut?
[111:43.72]No wonder you can't keep up.
[111:44.78]I know.
[111:47.42]I'm pretty much in molasses right now.
[111:54.67]Oh, he's dead.
[111:57.89]Oh, they're trying to snipe me.
[111:59.73]Yeah, they got a couple of snipers, actually, to be honest.
[112:03.05]Alright, let's get some effing speed here.
[112:09.99]Whoa, we're live.
[112:13.23]Oh, look at that slug.
[112:15.57]Ah, I missed him.
[112:18.03]I can't even, like, go chase him, either.
[112:20.13]I'm like the heavy weapons guy.
[112:23.57]No, that's your character in SWAT War.
[112:25.55]No, that's right.
[112:28.06]Oh, I finally died.
[112:29.30]Oh, wait.
[112:29.66]Am I actually going to, like, move more than, like, two miles per hour now?
[112:34.08]Oh, somebody else picked up the flag.
[112:35.75]Oh, great.
[112:36.53]I'm going in the opposite direction that everybody is.
[112:38.25]Alright.
[112:41.27]That's enough.
[112:42.33]I'm changing the pathfinder.
[112:44.65]Oh, my flying bag.
[112:45.59]Time to commit suicide.
[112:48.61]That didn't even kill me.
[112:51.91]Oh, what's that?
[112:52.69]It's a big bouncing blue-green ball.
[112:55.55]Oh!
[112:57.67]Burgah Boy, is that you with the flag?
[112:59.18]No, that's the Quay.
[113:01.14]Oh, so beautiful.
[113:02.08]I'm going this way.
[113:04.40]MLG Grandpa is on an off season right now.
[113:06.94]He'll be back in probably a couple weeks.
[113:09.12]I'm assuming.
[113:12.89]I'm going to go help protect the flag carrier.
[113:20.55]Woohoo!
[113:22.49]Oh.
[113:22.77]Oh.
[113:25.52]If you hit one of those water geysers when they're going off, it'll actually give you a ton of air.
[113:30.22]Really?
[113:31.22]I don't know if you've seen them.
[113:32.33]They're going off on the mountains.
[113:35.35]The best two maps are this one and the one we're going to play next.
[113:38.79]And the worst one's that long one we just got done playing.
[113:41.57]That's my opinion.
[113:45.64]I like the castle one the best.
[113:51.82]What just hit me?
[113:57.96]I just got a I'll scrubs me that on top notes she has sweet sweet grenade list drama yet about the credit is your super duper
[114:27.34]Okay.
[114:28.72]How do you use that then?
[114:29.97]3, 4, 5.
[114:31.35]Yeah, 3, 4, 5.
[114:32.37]I'm just going to shoot it randomly over here.
[114:36.45]Let's see if I end the game.
[114:39.03]How big is the orbital strike?
[114:41.43]I think I ended it with my strike.
[114:44.69]Orbital strike's huge.
[114:46.35]I got like 4 or 5 kills with it.
[114:49.29]I ate 31 flag held medals.
[114:52.25]Sick.
[114:53.41]Simpsons999, yes, Etalyx is on that server.
[114:56.69]Yeah.
[115:02.60]Oh.
[115:05.54]Alright, though.
[115:05.98]I think that's going to be it for this stream.
[115:09.59]First place, second place, third place, fifth place.
[115:12.73]Cool.
[115:14.19]That's pretty legit.
[115:15.67]Yeah.
[115:16.31]It's almost too legit.
[115:18.55]Almost.
[115:20.03]Not quite.
[115:20.95]Yeah, sorry, Ari, if you didn't get in in time.
[115:26.31]Sorry I didn't get it in time, Ari.
[115:27.49]Let's do it for next time.
[115:29.71]Yeah, I know.
[115:30.14]I'm game for next time.
[115:32.58]But yeah, thanks everybody for coming.
[115:34.74]Appreciate it.
[115:36.46]Are you going to play QWOP to end the stream by yourself?
[115:40.28]To end the stream by myself?
[115:42.06]I am.
[115:42.51]I'm probably going to go get some butter toast because I just woke up and it's like 5pm.
[115:48.75]Alright, well for bandwidth purposes I'm going to just end the call.
[115:53.65]No, I'm going to end the call because I'm the host.
[115:55.23]Alright, well thanks for coming to the stream guys.
[115:58.04]Alright everyone, see you next time.
[116:01.28]Take care.
[116:01.76]Lettuce.
[116:05.15]Alright, let's play a little QWOP.
[116:07.19]If you missed it, I'm going to upload this whole thing to YouTube, by the way.
[116:10.29]So the whole thing will be on YouTube.
[116:13.56]If you missed the beginning.
[116:17.90]QWOP.
[116:19.48]Make sure this is even lined up.
[116:22.34]Oh, what's this big annoying ad over here?
[116:24.42]Oh my god.
[116:25.52]I'm refreshing this.
[116:26.48]That's like going to give me a seizure.
[116:28.66]Here we go.
[116:33.21]Let's do it.
[116:36.25]Alright, I'm going to really take my time with this.
[116:41.16]See if I can get into slug mode again.
[116:44.28]But yeah, thank you if you guys are taking off.
[116:45.58]Thank you so much for coming.
[116:46.54]If you missed the beginning of the stream, it's going to be on YouTube in the next probably couple hours.
[116:50.98]Whenever YouTube decides to process it, who knows how long that's going to take.
[116:54.99]But yeah.
[116:55.27]Let's end it on this one last one.
[116:58.19]Come on.
[116:59.79]Now I'm going backwards.
[117:01.05]Going backwards!
[117:01.75]That's not what I want to do.
[117:05.41]Uh...
[117:12.19]If I get 10 meters, I'll be happy.
[117:13.56]That's all I care about.
[117:17.40]Oh, yeah.
[117:17.94]I feel like I'm doing a dance move.
[117:21.14]Like, stick your left leg out, pull your left leg down.
[117:25.59]That's gonna be the... Oh, my God.
[117:30.25]I can't go forward.
[117:32.49]I can't... My right leg is always the leg that I can never use.
[117:35.45]I don't know why.
[117:35.97]It always ends up like that.
[117:40.28]And that's when we fall back.
[117:46.92]But yeah, thank you so much, guys.
[117:48.95]I'm going to end it with that.
[117:50.49]I am tired.
[117:55.59]But yeah, I'll catch you guys later.
[117:58.53]Thanks again for coming.
[117:59.23]This will be on YouTube again, like I said.
[118:01.79]So, peace, guys.
[118:04.19]I'm getting some acid reflux.
[118:06.93]But yeah, peace, guys.
[118:07.87]Thank you so much for coming.
[118:09.58]Take care, guys.
[118:11.73]Bye.
