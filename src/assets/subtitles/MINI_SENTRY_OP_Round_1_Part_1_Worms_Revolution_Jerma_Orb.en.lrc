[07:38.57]Oh, this is going to be perfect.
[07:40.13]Oh, yes.
[07:40.55]I just have to figure out, what do we have?
[07:42.15]Dude, baseball bat me like a boss.
[07:47.12]Who has the cool voice pack?
[07:49.88]I'm using the Australian person.
[07:51.50]Oh.
[07:54.31]What is this?
[07:54.93]I don't like what I see.
[07:56.47]This is the DLC bullshit that I talked about.
[08:02.31]This is what he gets for the DLC.
[08:14.26]MLG grandpa up in the top.
[08:15.78]Oh, what's this?
[08:16.38]Oh, what's this turret?

[08:21.04]Oh, fuck.

[08:25.65]That is the best shit I've ever seen.
[08:28.27]That was bull.
[08:30.17]That is the best shit I've ever seen, I think.
[08:32.23]That was unbelievable.
[08:33.60]Where am I?
[08:34.46]This guy right here?
[08:35.20]I'm not going to screw this up.
[08:39.38]Burgah Boy.
[08:40.08]Oh yeah, baseball bat me into Charlie.
[08:43.10]No, do it.
[08:45.58]Can I even do that?
[08:46.61]Yeah.
[08:46.91]You have to hit me from the other side.
[08:48.53]I don't have any time for that.
[08:51.09]Oh, you bitch.
[08:52.15]That shit was weak.
[08:55.73]That's more than the Uzi.
[08:57.59]What the hell?
[09:00.23]You could have got a double cheeseburger there, Jeremy.
[09:03.13]Alright, somebody start killing orb.
[09:05.09]I'm like losing.
[09:06.75]Yeah, you're up there camping.
[09:09.51]Yeah, you're the one cheating with the stupid turret.
[09:12.33]Camper dude.
[09:12.95]Mini-Sentry BS.
[09:15.47]Hang grenade.
[09:18.59]Do it.
[09:20.91]Oh, rocket launcher.
[09:22.63]You're gonna completely miss.
[09:27.09]Get in the water.
[09:29.59]If he stays alive, that's a pretty good spot to be in.
[09:33.11]Down there?
[09:33.83]Yeah, because I can hide from all the BS you guys throw.
[09:38.15]Oh, man.
[09:39.01]John, I have two dudes checking you out.
[09:41.44]Oh, shit.
[09:42.90]Okay, here we go.
[09:43.26]I don't really know what's going on.
[09:44.50]Where are you?
[09:46.14]What are you doing?
[09:46.74]What character are you using?
[09:49.40]Are you his MLG grandpa right now?
[09:51.46]No.
[09:53.33]Where the hell is he?
[09:54.35]Oh, shit.
[09:55.11]Oh, he's going to get me.
[09:56.99]No, he's not.
[09:57.83]No!
[10:01.88]Oh my god.
[10:03.04]That was terrible.
[10:06.27]I seriously thought that was going to bounce back and come back and hit you in the face.
[10:09.63]I would have thrown up laughing if that happened.
[10:11.81]This is just going really bad for me.
[10:15.71]Yeah, don't walk into my sentry, dude.
[10:17.61]Don't walk into my sentry.
[10:19.26]Alright, well, I think time's going to run out before anyone wins, so I'm going to lose by default here.
[10:24.94]You're going to win by default.
[10:26.30]No.
[10:27.18]I think I'm losing damage-wise.
[10:31.39]Whoa!
[10:32.41]Whoa!
[10:32.89]Did I get him?
[10:35.61]If that would have hit you, I would have won.
[10:37.61]That was extreme.
[10:40.47]Damn it.
[10:43.97]Oh, you're done.
[10:45.62]You are done.
[10:46.18]You are done, son.
[10:47.70]You're done.
[10:48.84]What can we do?
[10:50.12]What can we do?
[10:50.86]You should try to baseball bat him out of the arena.
[10:59.41]What?
[11:00.75]You're stuffing me in the corner.
[11:02.65]I don't know.
[11:03.59]Thanks for doing that, by the way, because now I get a little spot.
[11:06.43]Are you taking damage?
[11:07.77]I think so.
[11:08.51]Yeah, I did.
[11:08.89]Okay.
[11:11.09]That wasn't worth it.
[11:13.07]That wasn't worth it?
[11:14.49]I thought I was lighting you up, man.
[11:16.86]30 damage.
[11:17.98]Ooh, I'm spot.
[11:19.14]I'm up there.
[11:19.92]What are you doing?
[11:21.38]Yeah.
[11:21.96]Go get the free stuff.
[11:23.24]Free stuff.
[11:24.44]Go take all the cool stuff.
[11:27.24]What did you get?
[11:28.34]Grenades?
[11:30.22]Call in like a friggin' airstrike on us.
[11:32.26]Yeah, he's just playing around up there.
[11:35.62]Uh... Not down there.
[11:36.85]What the hell?
[11:37.27]How pretty much you can... Unless you dig down, there's not really much you can do up there.
[11:40.87]Yeah.
[11:41.17]I think Shippy's gonna win by default because he's in that little space.
[11:44.49]MLG Grandpa's 125 health, camping it up.
[11:46.79]He's got Juggernaut.
[11:48.35]Oh, you're dead right here.
[11:50.87]No.
[11:52.31]Hopefully you kill yourself about it.
[11:54.17]No, there's no way I'm gonna be... Wait a minute.
[11:55.97]Okay, I got the Dragon Ball.
[11:58.61]This guy is gonna die.
[11:59.17]You're gonna mess us up.
[12:00.83]Oh, shit.
[12:01.83]No, I'm not.
[12:02.63]Yeah.
[12:04.81]Terminated.
