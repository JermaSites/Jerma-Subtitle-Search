[05:07.82]Thank you.

[05:11.46]Watch out, that's a spy.

[05:13.08]Just an engineer with a shotgun.
[05:16.46]Watch out for that spy.
[05:17.58]Nope.
[05:20.81]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[05:21.76]Cap, cap, cap, cap, cap, cap, cap, cap.

[05:29.72]It calms my nerves.
[05:30.96]We're going to have to talk about you drinking on the job every day.
[05:34.30]I've got a crown.
[05:36.10]I can do whatever I want.
[05:37.24]Will you quit following me?
[05:38.15]I feel like you're going to backstab me.
[05:43.73]Egg.
[05:46.51]Oh, here we go.
[05:49.46]Nice crits, nice crits.
[05:52.18]It looked like you weren't on my team.
[05:57.90]It looked like for a second you weren't on my team.
[06:01.68]There is like two Quick-Fix mechs on this team.
[06:07.91]I'm just like baiting people in here to like get killed by this entry.
[06:12.67]No, you want to have a melee fight?
[06:14.13]Let's go.
[06:15.07]Come on, come get me.
[06:18.06]Yeah, come get me.
[06:19.56]Ow.

[06:31.79]Where's the engineer?
[06:32.35]Is he dead?
[06:33.39]Damn it.
[06:34.67]Well, that's not good.
[06:35.79]Run away.

[06:41.20]Give me the health.
[06:41.68]Where is it?
[06:42.00]Where is it?
[06:42.26]Where is it?
[06:42.50]Where is it?
[06:43.16]Bad move.
[06:43.64]Bad move.
[06:44.08]Turn around.
[06:44.48]Run away.
