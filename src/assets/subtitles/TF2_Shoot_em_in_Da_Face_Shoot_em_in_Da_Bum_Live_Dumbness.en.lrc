[05:34.30]I've got a crown.
[05:36.10]I can do whatever I want.
[05:37.24]Will you quit following me?
[05:38.15]I feel like you're going to backstab me.
[05:43.73]Egg.
[05:46.51]Oh, here we go.
[05:49.46]Nice crits, nice crits.

[05:57.90]It looked like for a second you weren't on my team.
[06:01.68]There is like two quick fix mechs on this team.
[06:07.91]I'm just like baiting people in here to like get killed by this entry.
