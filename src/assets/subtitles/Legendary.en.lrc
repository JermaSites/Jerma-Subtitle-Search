[00:00.77]We're putting it what is what is what is legendary?
[00:04.31]What is it?
[00:05.35]I don't know What is this game I have no idea
[00:32.73]Hair whip one hour and sometimes you make a set and you gotta make an exception sometimes that game is fucking terrible I'm trying to What is this game?
[00:59.27]Legendary, why did I buy this?
[01:00.61]What is this game?
[01:01.13]Oh?
[01:04.14]I have no idea.
[01:08.46]We're gonna play it though.
[01:10.52]You'll play Vin Diesel for an hour, but not Magus.
[01:13.12]That game was... That game was literally un-fucking-bearable.
[01:18.46]I couldn't do it.
[01:19.98]Let's read the back of the box.
[01:21.06]Let's take a look.
[01:24.57]Journey to find the power that is rightfully yours.
[01:27.89]Magus has been imprisoned and tortured with no end in sight.
[01:32.53]One day a mysterious woman named Kina appears and helps him break free.
[01:37.67]She convinces him to embark on a perilous journey to fulfill his destiny, using his unique powers to defeat all who stand in his path.
[01:45.34]But with two powerful kingdoms vying to control the land and their eyes set on Magus's powers, how will he overcome the odds to become the god he was meant to be?
[01:54.97]A fourth grader wrote that.
[01:58.22]That's what's jotted in the back of your little brother's notebook in the back of his fucking math notebook.
[02:06.37]A god with the power of arcane.
[02:08.97]Powerful spells.
[02:10.83]I don't... I don't care.
[02:13.83]I don't care.
[02:14.83]It's over.
[02:15.97]You'll never see that again. 20%.
[02:31.03]I love powerful spells.
[02:35.49]Almost there.
[02:38.61]100 RPM.
[02:40.15]Past the time with some Magus.
[02:42.43]How's the hair?
[02:43.39]Should I grow it out?
[02:44.10]What do you think?
[02:45.52]Should I like grow this fucking hair out a little bit?
[02:48.24]I think so.
[02:51.08]It's a little fucked up looking.
[02:52.20]It's alright though.
[02:52.74]I was thinking maybe like a little wave.
[02:57.20]Maybe it's just a little wave.
[03:00.27]Who knows?
[03:00.63]Maybe.
[03:00.75]Maybe.
[03:03.32]Grow a rat tail?
[03:04.20]I can't grow a rat tail.
[03:06.16]I look like a fucking doofus.
[03:07.51]You want me to look like a doofus?
[03:08.51]It's empty.
[03:18.95]What a shame.
[03:20.92]I'll be right back.
[05:52.89]Clown car joke.
[05:55.63]What are we talking about?
[05:56.61]No, I just went and got a drink.
[06:00.79]Because I was empty.
[06:03.05]It was empty.
[06:12.32]Could have been a disaster.
[06:14.22]But we're good.
[06:20.93]What are we at?
[06:21.83]Fifty, uh... Fifty-five percent.
[06:30.66]I'm not gonna break the Magus disk.
[06:32.62]No.
[06:34.26]That is not a good idea.
[06:40.62]That is a soda pop.
[06:43.82]Just kidding.
[06:47.95]I didn't mean to bring back the facecam.
[06:51.72]Let's take a look at some bits.
[06:55.00]In the meantime.
[06:57.14]This is the end of the stream, by the way.
[06:59.41]We're gonna play Legendary for like 30 minutes, and then I'm out of here.
[07:05.19]Thank you Sprigwar for the five bucks.
[07:07.83]It's been a while since I could give bits, so here I go.
[07:10.88]I'm currently too nervous to sleep on my end because I'm away at university while my family's braving Hurricane Harvey.
[07:17.37]So spending time in your stream has really cheered me up.
[07:19.73]Thanks for the laughs tonight.
[07:21.19]You're doing good, Germs.
[07:22.93]Well, Hurricane Harvey is kind of fucking crazy, man.
[07:28.21]Everything I've seen on TV, it's like sweeping over Texas right now, right?
[07:31.69]Or is it Texas?
[07:33.94]I'm not sure where it is right now, but hopefully your family is safe.
[07:38.92]It's never like a good situation.
[07:43.54]So hopefully your family is good to go.
[07:46.32]Because that is a terrifying fucking hurricane.
[07:55.87]Corpus Christi is getting wrecked.
[07:57.49]Really?
[07:59.02]I actually know somebody that is that like was in Corpus Christi.
[08:05.22]So hopefully everyone's staying safe.
[08:10.77]uh but man thanks for the five dollars appreciate it have I ever been in a hurricane I have I'm not in a situation like what's going on in Texas right now I've been in like small hurricanes like I think like hurricane Bob was the worst hurricane I ever was like a part of and that was like 15 years ago 20 years ago something crazy
[08:33.12]But not like what's going on now.
[08:36.06]So I obviously wish you all the best if you're in that area.
[08:39.52]Stay safe, guys.
[08:41.58]Gurfield, thanks for the $2.
[08:43.26]You look like you smell funny in a good way.
[08:45.95]No.
[08:47.87]I don't think I smell funny.
[08:50.77]I smell.
[08:52.61]Look, everybody has a human smell.
[08:54.89]All humans have a distinct odor.
[08:57.75]Not bad.
[08:59.91]Not good.
[09:01.21]Not bad, though.
[09:02.98]But thank you, Gurfield, for the $2.
[09:04.80]Fiasco, thanks for the bits.

[09:21.02]I look like a Discount Wolverine?
[09:31.02]That's pretty good.
[09:32.47]That's a pretty good insult.
[09:34.27]I'll take it.
[09:35.35]Sure.
[09:35.75]Yeah, I do.
[09:37.91]I look like Wolverine's little shitty brother.

[09:52.80]Good.
[09:53.64]Fucking fine.
[09:54.18]I don't want to be the mainstream Wolverine.
[09:55.64]I want to be the Wolverine that lives in the sewer.
[09:58.27]I want to be the Wolverine that, like, wraps himself in fucking saran wrap for his costume and has, like, two little fucking cat ears.
[10:05.12]Get out of here.
[10:06.88]Discount Wolverine.
[10:07.58]I'll give you a fucking real... Yeah, I'll give you a real Wolverine.

[10:29.38]Have a thing going on, a rivalry.
[10:32.78]I'm not going to get involved.
[10:34.52]Sprig War, thanks for the $5.
[10:35.45]I already, I mean, I'm an idiot.
[10:39.25]Like, my brain sucks and I've been drinking a couple of beers.
[10:41.77]So, like, I'm an idiot.
[10:44.51]But thank you, Sprig War.
[10:46.29]Can the Insane again?
[10:48.54]Here's my first bits of the night, Jerry.
[10:50.36]Can you give me a sick dab for all those lovers in the chat?

[12:49.49]Alright, let's get this done.
[12:50.87]Controls, no vibration, please.
[12:53.69]Turn that down a little.
[12:54.89]Aim, assist.
[12:55.49]Yes, it's a console game.

[13:07.54]Somebody gave money.
[13:09.31]Lamblam666 gave 50 bucks right now.
[13:11.23]And it says, Dear Jerma, when I have had a rough day, I play one of your streams and fall asleep in my cozy bed listening to your soothing voice.
[13:28.94]Except last Friday, when you screamed really loud and woke me up in fear.
[13:35.12]Thanks for the nightmare.
[13:36.32]Love you.
[13:36.57]I'm sorry.
[13:44.27]Look, I'm sorry.
[13:45.27]I'm sorry that, like, I scream.
[13:46.59]Sometimes I scream.
[13:48.16]Sometimes I, like, talk shit.
[13:50.04]It happens.
[13:50.58]I'm sorry, Lambland.
[13:51.44]But thank you for the $50, man.
[13:54.80]That's extremely generous of you.
[13:57.02]A lot of generosity tonight.
[13:58.18]A lot of, like, big 50 drops.
[14:00.53]Somebody give $100 fucking dollars.
[14:04.33]A lot of big money drops.
[14:07.29]Chubbiest Thread gave a fucking hundred bucks earlier.
[14:10.45]And even continued to give money.
[14:13.19]You guys are too nice to me.
[14:14.28]You guys are too kind.
[14:15.88]You just are.
[14:18.37]Uh, let's turn this back on.

[14:24.60]I still have things to stream.
[14:25.90]I'm still having fun.

[14:50.25]What kind of game is this?
[14:52.27]I bought this in like a fucking haze.
[14:56.27]No gamer profile is signed in.
[14:57.81]Without signing in a gamer profile, you cannot save.
[15:00.61]Sign in a gamer profile, for Christ's sake.
[15:04.20]Turn this shit up.
[15:04.94]I ain't playing a dark-ass game.
[15:06.92]I don't know the way I'm going to find a current objective.
[15:18.35]Alcoholic streamer buys game in a drunken haze.
[15:20.98]That's not what happened.
[15:25.98]Do you know what I got- I got egg salad upstairs, I can't wait for that.
[15:31.72]I'm gonna eat a really- you know like you know when you make like a sandwich and you make it way too fucking thick and you don't like it?
[15:38.00]You put like nine slices of ham on that sandwich and you get like irritated at yourself because you take a bite and it's like this is too much fucking ham in here I don't want it.
[15:48.00]I'm doing like I'm like slabbing egg salad in the middle of this fucking bulky roll and man it's gonna be-
[15:55.00]I'm gonna press down and bite and it's gonna squish out the sides. That's how much egg salad's gonna be in this fucking sandwich.
[16:04.00]Ah there's a box.
[16:06.15]Pandora's box.
[16:19.69]Too much ham?
[16:23.02]You know, I got corned beef too.
[16:26.08]I'm a big deli guy.
[16:27.44]You guys know that?
[16:27.92]I'm a big deli sandwich kind of guy.
[16:30.32]It's so easy.
[16:32.44]Really inexpensive.
[16:34.42]And it lasts a long time.
[16:37.66]Nobody respects the deli sandwich anymore.
[16:40.78]Everybody wants to put like fucking sea salt on everything.
[16:44.73]Get out of here.
[16:45.53]Give me the fucking dirt.
[16:47.85]Sprinkle some dirt on my like a sea salt.
[16:51.31]I don't want that shit.
[16:51.89]It comes from the fucking sea.
[16:52.91]Sharks are in there.
[17:01.10]What am I doing?
[17:08.64]This zombie is great, yeah.
[17:19.17]Why am I laughing at this?
[17:21.13]That shouldn't be funny.
[17:32.02]Don't drink in stream.
[17:33.62]I haven't even had that much to drink.
[17:34.92]It's Friday night!
[17:35.80]Come on, I'm like relaxing.
[17:37.00]I had a rough week.
[17:40.00]A ship might pass twice this week.
[17:42.30]I've had a rough week.
[17:46.18]Alright, checkpoint.
[17:49.15]Use L to move and strafe, R to look around, press turn, press square to continue.
[17:53.85]Okay.
[17:56.19]Pandora's box has branded your left hand with a signal.

[20:12.39]Uh, okay.
[20:15.59]I'm glad, like, Zool is showing up from Ghostbusters 1.
[20:18.15]I'm trying to get out.

[20:34.98]Okay.
[20:37.68]Who is this?
[20:39.85]Is this like an NPC?
[20:43.33]She's gonna get crushed.

[21:08.89]We're good.
[21:17.92]Really, dude?
[21:18.40]Like, you're gonna light me on fire?
[21:20.24]Get the fuck out of here.
[21:22.73]Find the water valve to extinguish the fire.
[21:26.47]God, come on.
[21:30.11]Does anybody know what this game is?
[21:36.45]I'm willing to give this a chance for at least another 20-30 minutes.
[21:42.07]What's the premise here?
[21:44.13]Give me the long and short of it.
[21:53.43]Uh, it's a game about shooting monsters.
[21:56.97]Okay.
[21:59.49]I used to like this game, so it's like fun.
[22:01.35]Okay.
[22:01.96]That's interesting.

[22:09.36]I think that's me.
[22:15.26]The city's like just in shambles.
[22:25.57]I opened a box with monsters, now I have to kill the monsters.
[22:33.36]Okay.
[22:37.44]Uh... What the fuck?
[22:47.56]Okay, this is just like... Somebody just made a GTA mod.
[22:51.94]Called, like, Earthquake Gravity.
[23:00.78]There's too much going on.
[23:02.50]Oh, what in the name of God is that?
[23:04.64]That's a griffin.
[23:07.47]Okay, a griffin shows up.
[23:10.13]See you later, random guy.
[23:15.81]How do I get out of here?
[23:20.19]I can't leave.
[23:20.81]There we go.
[23:27.20]All these random people that die.
[23:28.52]This is stupid.
[23:31.65]Please.
[23:32.49]Really?
[23:32.83]You're just dropping fucking taxi cabs on me?
[23:48.32]Oh, hi.

[23:50.24]Thanks, friend.
[23:51.20]Whoa!
[23:52.10]You don't... Yeah, okay.
[23:52.98]You bite... You bite me, too.
[23:55.46]Jesus Christ!
[23:59.42]Okay.
[24:00.02]No more fucking around.
[24:00.80]Let's get out of here.
[24:08.43]Okay, I have to go this way.
[24:09.41]Press R2 to use your weapon.
[24:19.21]Do I go after the griffins?
[24:26.12]I guess not.
[24:27.08]Okay, well, let's go.
[24:28.54]Oh god.
[24:34.08]Where the hell do I need to go?
[24:35.34]This way?
[24:38.93]Jesus, these birds are fucking insane.
[24:48.63]This is fucking carnage.
[24:51.67]This is absolute chaos.
[24:55.27]I have nothing to even say, like the people are just getting eaten by giant birds.
[24:59.59]Where do I go?
[25:00.15]How do I get out of here?
[25:03.79]I have to go right here.
[25:05.37]What?
[25:12.19]We're gonna get sucked into a black hole.
[25:18.04]It's making like a giant golem.
[25:19.92]Okay?
[25:20.80]Golem.
[25:27.48]This is kinda cool.
[25:29.34]Like, I'm not gonna lie to you, this is actually pretty cool.
[25:33.69]This is cool.
[25:36.63]Giant scary guy.
[25:39.15]Made out of cars.
[25:41.03]Attacking New York City or whatever the hell he is Did somebody order a stupid-looking boss what that guy would that was cool That was pretty cool actually Now this might be one of those games that just completely blows its load in like the first 10 minutes
[26:09.24]And the rest of the game is terrible.
[26:10.60]I don't know.
[26:18.68]L1 is... I sprinted and died.
[26:27.67]Uh... What?
[26:33.21]The common theme in this game is cars.
[26:35.19]I guess I held L1 to die.
[26:38.32]Apparently.
[26:44.13]Be more careful now.
[26:45.49]What did I do?
[26:45.99]I got, like, electrocuted.
[26:48.15]Alright, at least I'm right here.
[26:55.13]Sprint.
[26:58.07]Hold L1 to sprint.
[27:00.83]Okay, I'm trying to do... Now I have a gun.
[27:05.77]Where did I get the gun?
[27:06.53]Equip guns?
[27:09.03]Equip your axe?
[27:09.93]Okay, so is that a bad guy?
[27:12.23]I think people have become, like, zombies.
[27:17.88]I guess not.
[27:22.39]That's 94 rounds.
[27:30.05]Easy enough.
[27:32.15]Take out the board.
[27:36.91]God damn it.
[27:41.61]How do I get back up there?
[27:50.38]Like that.
[27:50.84]That's how you get back up there.
[28:04.25]Legendary.
[28:06.41]Pretty fucking legendary.
[28:10.47]Alright, when do I get to fight the monsters?
[28:13.65]That's what I want.
[28:14.33]Trace the water pipe to the valve to extinguish the fire.
[28:20.82]Not this bullshit.
[28:21.64]But that was easy.
[28:22.42]Okay, never mind.
[28:24.15]I hold my tongue.
[28:28.91]I gotta suck up the cloud shit?
[28:32.47]Why?
[28:32.93]Wait, I do?
[28:34.01]Do I have to?
[28:36.05]Is it imperative?
[28:40.97]How do I get it?
[28:41.47]Oh, there we go.
[28:43.37]Okay.
[28:46.40]Not sucking the cloud shit is giving me anxiety.
[28:55.50]I'm interested.
[28:57.36]I'm interested.
[28:57.82]Alright, we're good.
[29:14.93]First boss fight.
[29:17.64]Bird dragon.
[29:23.48]Maybe not.
[29:31.40]Game looks pretty, so far it's pretty interesting.
[29:35.78]How much was this game?
[29:36.68]10 bucks?
[29:40.45]Fit.
[29:42.49]The game crashed.
[29:47.37]Probably like $4.
[29:51.58]How do I use it?
[29:55.60]Double tap, okay, double tap.
[30:00.20]will affect creatures.
[30:11.97]Can't kill pedestrians with a 0 out of 10 game.
[30:19.33]It's $3 on Steam.
[30:20.99]So you're telling me I spent more money on this than it is on Steam?
[30:30.19]I bought this game instead of buying it on Steam.
[30:34.79]Watch out for the bullfrog enemy.
[30:41.01]Why am I playing this on PS3 then?
[30:42.49]That was so anticlimactic.
[30:53.82]Alright, drain him.
[30:58.31]They built that up like it was gonna be hard.
[31:00.09]They're just Dodongos.
[31:11.72]Yeah, they are.
[31:22.02]Not bad.
[31:22.42]It's not a bad game.
[31:30.00]I don't hate it.
[31:30.50]I don't love it, but I don't hate it.
[31:34.44]It was worth a buy.
[31:37.40]It was worth a check.
[31:46.04]Get up there.
[31:46.44]Come on.
[31:47.10]What is this?
[31:47.48]I gotta go all the way around?
[32:08.16]Suck him up!
[32:11.16]I know, apparently I can only jump like three inches.
[32:14.02]Somehow.
[32:16.04]Don't ask me why, I can only jump like a quarter of a foot in the air.
[32:21.97]I paid for this game with a check.
[32:25.53]Yeah, I wrote a check to Amazon and got this game.
[32:28.09]That guy?
[32:36.68]Come on, open the door.
[32:39.30]Come on, die.
[32:47.70]We died.
[32:48.23]Oh, it is dead.
[32:49.49]Okay.
[32:52.47]Why did I jump down here to get... Why did I jump down there?
[32:56.89]I gotta go all the way around now to get the stupid, like, green, blue... It's not even green!
[33:03.35]It's not even green.
[33:05.52]Don't say green if it's not green.
[33:07.87]It's blue and purple and red.
[33:12.63]You fucking idiot.
[33:14.45]What are you, out of your mind?
[33:25.54]Turn the wheel.
[33:29.70]This is bad Doom.
[33:33.44]You know, I could actually see that.
[33:36.74]Oh my fucking god.
[33:48.58]It can be green if you want it to be.
[33:50.36]Maybe.
[33:50.60]I swear to god.
[33:59.00]God damn it.
[34:02.12]Isn't Bad Doom just Doom 3?
[34:04.06]You know, that is a good point.
[34:06.79]Touche.
[34:08.03]Hey, hey, hey.
[34:09.05]Touche.
[34:13.19]You know, it ain't easy being cheesy, alright?
[34:16.12]Oh, I'm hungry.
[34:19.60]This stream's gonna end real soon, because I want to get a fucking, I want to get like a tuna sandwich.
[34:24.38]Egg, no, what was it?
[34:24.92]Egg salad?
[34:25.66]Egg salad.
[34:26.40]That's what I want.
[34:29.24]God, what is this?
[34:32.45]Creatures?! !
[34:38.07]This echo is kind of annoying.
[34:39.67]I thought Doom 3 was a good game.
[34:49.56]It's not the Doom experience, but it wasn't bad.
[34:53.52]I didn't hate Doom 3.
[34:58.17]See you later.
[35:02.05]Oh no, anything but creatures!
[35:07.22]Look, I'm trying to end their misery.
[35:10.50]It's going to be just total misery.
[35:13.90]I wouldn't want to live like that, would you?
[35:16.54]I wouldn't.
[35:18.88]Crouch?
[35:19.24]No.
[35:21.46]Crouch?
[35:24.82]How do you crouch?
[35:27.27]That's how you crouch.
[35:33.15]Alright, well, fuck him.
[35:34.47]Leave him.
[35:46.42]Well, if you're wondering what we're going to do on Tuesday.
[35:50.44]Tuesday is probably going to be Absolver.
[35:52.78]So we're going to go to Absolver on Tuesday.
[35:57.36]And play that for a couple of days probably.
[36:01.39]Looks like it's really fun.
[36:02.51]And I'm just getting overwhelmed by these sausage meatballs.
[36:08.65]I might even die here.
[36:10.83]Too many people are in here.
[36:14.69]What the fuck is going on in this hallway?
[36:20.65]What the fuck, man?
[36:22.11]There's so many donkeys in here!
[36:24.65]There's like a hundred donkeys!
[36:32.77]Don't even think about it.
[36:36.65]Is this the darkness?
[36:37.73]I know, right.
[36:38.37]That's what it reminds me of.
[36:44.75]That FOV, when you zoom in, when you do aim down sights is so bad.
[36:54.10]Well, here's like the fourth valve we've had to turn.
[37:13.63]Oh shit.
[37:14.37]Look at how hunched down I just was.
[37:17.01]I was just like this.
[37:18.99]Like, what the fuck kind of gremlin am I when I play video games?
[37:22.79]That's why I don't want a facecam.
[37:25.24]The reason why I don't have a facecam, guys, is because of what you just saw, right?
[37:29.22]So I'm just sitting there like... That's why I don't have a facecam on.
[37:38.30]Fucking got like a hunchback.
[37:40.77]Jesus.
[37:41.05]Jesus.
[37:43.48]No, look, look.
[37:44.18]When the facecam is on, like, I'm fucking sitting up straight.
[37:46.54]And, like, look at how good I look.
[37:50.26]I look like a beetle.
[37:51.22]I probably do.
[37:51.98]Who cares?
[37:53.92]Uh, that's gonna be it.
[37:55.93]I've been streaming for, like, five and a half hours or something.
[37:58.57]What time is it?
[37:59.35]Like, twelve?
[38:00.47]Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.
[38:01.61]I've been streaming for, like, five hours.
[38:03.03]I'm tired.
[38:04.47]I've been drinking, like, fucking booze.
[38:07.11]I want, like, a fucking tuna sandwich.
[38:10.71]Anyways.
[38:12.17]Uh, thank you so much for watching.
[38:16.45]There are a ton more games to play.
[38:21.53]47 minutes.
[38:23.86]I had to restart the stream, man.
[38:25.00]I've been going for like five hours.
[38:28.04]But, again, enjoy your weekend.
[38:32.54]Have a good time on your weekend, guys.
[38:33.82]I hope you have a fun day.
[38:36.66]A fun couple of days.
[38:41.16]You may see a stream on Monday.
[38:44.03]I might play Stalker on Monday.
[38:48.64]I don't know.
[38:51.12]It is a slight possibility.
[38:54.32]I want to.
[38:56.30]Who knows?
[38:57.44]But Tuesday, expect Absolver.
[38:59.16]When Absolver comes out, it's apparently one of those open-worldy MMO fighting games.
[39:04.72]It looks really fun.
[39:06.59]So, if we don't see you on Monday, expect Tuesday.
[39:09.41]We're going to play Absolver.
[39:11.39]Back to PC gaming.
[39:13.55]And then maybe for a couple of days, maybe we'll go back to some more.
[39:16.65]There is one specific PS3 game, that like TV superstar game, and one other in particular that I have to play.
[39:25.03]And it reminds me like the movies.
[39:28.81]It's going to be a lot of fun.
[39:30.90]So next week, Absolver and this string of two games, which will not be named.
[39:39.14]Take care, guys.
[39:41.72]Again!
[39:42.08]Like, look at that.
[39:43.19]I came back to be here.
[39:46.79]And I was like... Do I really sit like this?
[39:53.45]Sit the fuck up straight, man.
[39:54.87]Come on.
[39:55.21]You look like a fucking idiot.
[39:59.65]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[40:02.63]Take care.
[40:02.99]If I don't see you Monday, I'll see you Tuesday.
[40:06.69]And Shrek Saget, thank you for the two bucks.
[40:09.00]They just say heart.
[40:09.80]Thank you.
[40:11.45]Coffee Cheetos Chicken.
[40:13.77]Thank you.
[40:14.83]Just forgive me.
[40:15.95]You've been forgiven.
[40:16.59]Don't worry.
[40:18.72]Candy Insane again.
[40:20.16]Thank you for the bets.
[40:22.30]I spent the last five years of my life crawling naked on the streets.
[40:27.16]Scrounging for pennies on rainy days.
[40:30.16]You better at least give me a $4 joker I'm unsubbing.
[40:34.85]Oh god.
[40:35.35]$4 joker.
[40:41.91]That's not quite a $10 joke, but that's not quite a $5 joke either.
[40:49.47]I got it.
[40:51.35]I got it.
[41:23.48]That's not a joke.
[41:24.46]I know.
[41:34.94]What's the joke?
[41:36.27]I don't, I don't, I don't know.
[41:37.23]I don't, like, look, I, I, I don't, I don't, I, my brain, it's not even a joke anymore.
[41:41.13]It was just like, I had that thing I wanted to do on stream.
[41:44.71]Stream is not in orbit soon.
[41:51.90]Good night, everybody.
[41:54.61]Thank you so much for watching.
[41:58.51]The joke is I can't joke.
[41:59.89]I don't know, guys.
[42:00.61]I'm just fucking around.
[42:02.30]Sorry for the loud noise.
[42:03.32]I apologize.
[42:06.60]Good night.
[42:08.24]Much love.
[42:09.29]I'll see you guys on Tuesday or Monday.
[42:11.31]Have a good night.
[42:28.72]you
