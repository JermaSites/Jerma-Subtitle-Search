[00:26.75]Hey, just just for let you know, it's.
[00:30.16]I don't think I've done two streams in a row since like 2022.
[00:34.10]Oh wait, no, I did do Elden Ring.
[00:40.38]I did Elden Ring DLC.
[00:42.12]It's true or mine.
[00:43.24]I'm completely wrong.
[00:44.30]Forget everything I said.
[00:46.65]How's it going?
[00:56.47]Where's Nancy Drew?
[00:57.27]We're not doing Nancy Drew today.
[01:00.11]I'm only going to be live for probably a few hours.
[01:03.57]Maybe two or three hours.
[01:04.31]Maybe three-ish.
[01:08.31]I want to do Neil.fun.
[01:10.03]I've been wanting to do this for a while.
[01:16.91]I told you we will finish Nancy Drew and the mysteries of Thornton Hall.
[01:22.53]Probably like next week.
[01:29.10]He's here for one day only.
[01:30.50]Yeah, I'm here.
[01:36.43]I'm here as many times as as many times as I'm going to be.
[01:42.07]Did you throw your back out?
[01:43.91]Hold on, did you throw your back out?
[01:46.41]Oh, you're gonna throw your back out.
[01:56.39]I love how people, people showed up and just say again, again.
[02:06.30]Uh, so, uh, who's played Neil.fun?
[02:12.95]Uh, N E A L dot F U N. Seems like there's a lot of stuff here.
[02:19.33]That's kind of right up my alley.
[02:20.49]I'm just, I'm not going to do everything, but I'm going to just chill, play a little bit of these.
[02:28.46]And you probably noticed, both in the pinned message and probably on the... Well, you can't see it on screen yet, but you will.
[02:35.11]Today, I said last night that my agency contacted me and said, hey, we're putting together a charity drive for the Habitat for Humanity Greater LA.
[02:47.26]to benefit the wildfires.
[02:49.04]So it's definitely it's been a terrible time.
[02:53.14]I've seen a lot of things.
[02:54.12]I know people personally that have been affected by this.
[02:57.85]It's pretty terrible.
[02:58.59]It's really fucking terrible.
[03:00.75]But I thought, you know what?
[03:03.21]If they're doing a big site wide thing, I definitely want to be involved.
[03:06.97]So I there is a Tiltify link.
[03:10.65]It's not like directly through Twitch.
[03:16.48]Yeah, to benefit the organization, Habitat for Humanity against the fires.
[03:26.31]Two days in a row?
[03:27.17]That's right.
[03:32.47]Yeah, in the offline chat, I was like, are you serious?
[03:38.80]I've never really done a direct through my channel charity drive before.
[03:45.16]I usually participate in a big event, whether it's, you know, like Seadog's Immune Deficiency Foundation or the Tip of the Hats or the Vinesauce is HOPE.
[03:56.73]I usually kind of get involved in a big event.
[03:59.89]So this is kind of a first for me.
[04:02.66]I'm curious how it works.
[04:04.02]I put the goal at 5,000 and it was destroyed.
[04:11.56]It's already like, I think pretty much there.
[04:14.20]And I didn't even turn the stream on.
[04:17.64]So I'm kind of, I'm probably going to increase the goal if we destroy this next one.
[04:23.44]So, but yeah, if you got some money, follow the links.
[04:27.36]I have a link.
[04:27.84]I have tilt by link.
[04:30.77]And yeah, it's, um, let's raise some money.
[04:36.10]And with that, let's do Neil.fun.
[04:45.10]Did you see the Switch 2?
[04:47.24]I did see the Switch 2.
[04:49.72]I love the, I especially like the animation where they, they kind of like filled in some goo into the analog stick.
[04:59.45]And then and then it was and then it was it was like they turned into little mice and they were like skittering around.
[05:05.66]I love that part.
[05:09.18]What am I drinking?
[05:09.86]I'm drinking a coconut water.
[05:11.93]I wanted some potassium today.
[05:19.17]It was cute.
[05:19.75]It was cute.
[05:32.02]Are you going to finish Zelda on the new Switch?
[05:34.86]I'm not even sure I'm going to buy a new Switch.
[05:39.48]Okay, I have a question about Switch.
[05:42.05]Is... Is it going to play Switch games or is it an entirely new... It's a Switch 2.
[05:52.11]So it's... Is it the Wii?
[05:55.37]Because remember the Wii could play GameCube games.
[05:59.50]So it's going to kind of be like the Wii.
[06:00.88]Okay.
[06:06.27]Will it play Wii games?
[06:11.33]Yeah.
[06:19.24]So it's just the Wii U. Yeah.
[06:22.02]Alright.
[06:22.68]I think you guys know which one I'm going to play first of this.
[06:25.52]But we'll see.
[06:26.66]I hope I did this overlay right.
[06:34.58]We'll find out.
[06:38.45]Oh, Hey, it works.
[06:40.95]Okay, cool.
[06:44.25]Very cool.
[06:45.37]5,600 bucks already.
[06:48.52]Damn.
[06:48.76]Alright.
[06:50.80]Hell yeah.
[06:51.28]Let's go.
[06:51.58]Alright.
[06:53.52]So this, uh, this is going to be, this one's, I mean, this is the first one.
[06:58.46]Should I play this one first?
[06:59.92]There's a lot of stuff here.
[07:03.19]I feel like I'll be on this one for like an hour.
[07:06.08]Where's Otto?
[07:08.18]Where's Otto?
[07:09.18]Oh, that's right.
[07:09.62]I did promise that.
[07:10.32]Otto will be here by the end of the stream.
[07:13.32]You will see a webcam video clip with me and Otto posing for a family photo.
[07:20.95]There you go.
[07:27.74]It has exclusives with backwards compatibility.
[07:30.12]I don't know.
[07:36.42]You could make auto cam a donation goal.
[07:39.38]I could do that, but the problem is I already said I was going to do it last night.
[07:52.15]Very cool.
[07:52.51]Alright.
[07:52.71]So what should I do for I'm going to do perfect circle because I've been I've been looking at this one.
[08:03.77]Is there audio on this?
[08:06.38]Alright, can you guys draw a perfect circle?
[08:08.12]I probably can.
[08:14.61]I mean, that's pretty great for literally just doing it once.
[08:19.55]Oh, you can't hear it.
[08:20.11]I'll turn it back on.
[08:29.56]93?
[08:30.66]You have to go faster.
[08:31.62]It didn't say anything about speed.
[08:39.91]Also, I probably shouldn't be doing this on a fucking couch.
[08:47.65]You can't get accuracy when you're sitting on a couch.
[08:50.16]Faster actually helps.
[08:54.04]It doesn't.
[08:55.08]Not for me, apparently.
[08:57.78]Holy shit, that was actually kind of good.
[08:59.40]Hold on.
[09:04.39]Oh!
[09:10.02]Fuck.
[09:10.74]It's okay.
[09:11.29]I'm sitting on a couch.
[09:12.35]I'm not at a desk.
[09:13.21]I'm going to go.
[09:19.55]Okay.
[09:19.87]I got to get to 95%.
[09:20.43]Too close to dot.
[09:20.83]Stop.
[09:20.93]Stop.
[09:50.04]You have to make it so you can't make it too small.
[09:51.76]It's too close to the dot.
[09:54.80]Yeah.
[09:55.10]Okay.
[09:55.24]How close is too close to the dot?
[09:56.88]Okay.
[09:58.58]You see?
[10:02.19]You're embarrassing.
[10:03.01]94% is pretty good.
[10:10.51]That one looks better than the 94% one.
[10:12.03]Doesn't it?
[10:34.14]94% is pretty draw cube instead.
[10:36.14]Oh, and that's an easy way to get 85%.
[10:42.61]How did I get 94.2%?
[11:26.53]How are you getting less than 80%?
[11:27.39]I'm sitting on a... I'm not even going to explain it again.
[11:32.87]I'm sitting on a couch.
[11:33.79]My mouse is on a couch.
[11:37.90]I am a fucking piece of shit that plays video games sitting on a couch.
[11:51.29]Let me try.
[11:51.61]Okay, 10 more tries and that's it.
[12:02.28]What?
[12:02.60]Oh, no, it's not 95.
[12:11.56]That's going to drive me insane.
[12:13.54]Oh, no, that's bad.
[12:35.40]94.9.
[12:35.44]Come on.
[12:35.92]Okay.
[12:36.40]Okay.
[12:37.34]Okay.
[12:48.45]Okay.
[12:48.89]Okay.
[12:49.35]Okay.
[12:49.65]Okay.
[12:50.01]Two more, three more times.
[12:57.13]That looks perfect.
[13:03.05]Go bigger.
[13:03.57]I feel like bigger is bad.
[13:08.11]Do it until you get to 100.
[13:10.61]What's the highest you guys are getting?
[13:17.26]Oh, no!
[13:18.16]What the?
[13:18.66]I'm going to quit.
[13:19.54]I'm going to quit the game.
[13:20.96]Because that sucks.
[13:22.18]That sucks.
[13:23.18]That's not cool.
[13:24.42]What the fuck happened?
[13:27.36]I was... Okay, here's what happened.
[13:30.19]I got to here, and I started pre-celebrating.
[13:34.39]This pixel, I started my celebration.
[13:36.07]I needed to go to here.
[14:25.28]Okay, I gotta go.
[14:27.20]One more.
[14:43.57]I got 94.
[14:43.93]I got 95%.
[14:45.53]That's pretty good.
[14:47.81]That's good enough.
[14:48.69]94 point, whatever.
[14:52.35]Oh, this one's injured.
[14:53.11]This one's quick.
[14:54.51]I already looked at it.
[14:56.69]This one is you pick a side and you click points for that side.
[15:03.13]And I guess you see what side wins.
[15:07.54]I don't know if anyone's on this website, right?
[15:09.08]I mean, it looks like a lot of people kind of currently are.
[15:14.14]What team are we going to be on?
[15:16.57]Sun or moon?
[15:17.91]I like both of these for different reasons.
[15:20.36]I do love the sunshine, though.
[15:22.22]I live in Las Vegas.
[15:23.32]We get sunshine 350 days a year.
[15:25.16]I'm on team sun.
[15:25.58]Alright, let's go.
[15:43.48]Oh, no!
[15:44.04]No, no, no.
[15:44.50]We need more per second.
[15:46.40]We need more points per second, please.
[15:51.80]Everybody do Sun right now if you're on this.
[15:59.95]Team Moon should have no... Team Moon should not have 1,000 points per second right now.
[16:07.17]That's right.
[16:09.21]Yeah!
[16:09.51]Yeah!
[16:13.70]No, come on.
[16:17.92]We need to take off the whole screen.
[16:24.78]Is it 817 million points?
[16:31.46]This is election fraud.
[16:32.63]Yeah.
[16:35.65]And the very important election on the sun versus the moon.
[16:48.95]It's funny because the moon, I think this is total, probably ever.
[16:53.49]So moon currently has what, like 100, over 100 million, 150 million more points.
[16:58.70]A lot of moon Andes on the internet, it seems.
[17:01.20]Alright, I'm going to let you guys just do it.
[17:05.00]I'm not going to say anything.
[17:05.96]I'm curious what happens.
[17:12.21]I'm curious what you guys actually want to do.
[17:21.33]We're already almost at $7,000.
[17:22.73]Wow.
[17:23.23]Okay.
[17:27.63]Holy shit.
[17:32.65]I'm going to have to up this goal.
[17:33.77]I'm going to have to up this goal to probably $10,000.
[17:37.02]Alright, cool.
[17:41.30]That's a fun one.
[17:43.44]This one's fun.
[17:44.24]I looked at it for a second.
[17:45.94]It's kind of like Doodle God.
[17:49.25]Remember that game?
[17:56.75]I'm usually pretty good at stuff like this, but... Depends.
[18:00.05]Alright, so we've got Earth, water, fire, wind.
[18:05.39]Uh... What's Earth and water?
[18:07.69]Plant.
[18:08.87]Earth and plant.
[18:09.97]Tree.
[18:10.85]Wind and tree.
[18:11.89]Leaf.
[18:13.47]Earth.
[18:14.05]Can you do Earth, wind, and fire?
[18:15.49]Like the band?
[18:19.69]Forest.
[18:21.07]Forest, water, swamp, Earth, swamp, mud.
[18:25.47]I actually wonder how much there really is.
[18:31.30]I could sit here for like hours and hours and hours and do this.
[18:34.44]I don't really want to do that to you all.
[18:36.64]I could sit here for like probably three hours.
[18:41.18]Fog and plant is mushroom.
[18:43.02]Okay.
[18:46.51]You can get to you.
[18:47.61]What?
[18:49.47]What do you mean you can get to you?
[19:03.78]It's AI generated?
[19:05.74]Is it really?
[19:08.68]Wait, what does Frog and Toad do?
[19:10.85]Alright, what does Prince and Frog do?
[19:14.79]Okay, what does Kiss Frog do?
[19:17.73]Oh, what does Kiss Prince do?
[19:21.55]Okay, what is Kiss Toad?
[19:26.57]Is Kiss Toad and Kiss Frog the same thing?
[19:30.29]Alright, prince and princess makes royalty.
[19:32.95]Royalty and toadstool makes a mushroom.
[19:40.67]Mushroom and rat?
[19:44.76]Leaf and prince is tree.
[19:50.08]Princess and Earth is bride.
[19:53.86]Bride and water.
[19:55.02]Oh.
[19:58.47]Bride and... Bride and Mist.
[20:02.37]I don't know.
[20:09.65]Okay, what about... What about, like, Wet Mushroom?
[20:15.95]What about Sponge Prince?
[20:19.83]I did it!
[20:21.51]SpongeBob and Royalty.
[20:22.98]It's SpongeBob SquarePants.
[20:24.84]I just beat the game.
[20:25.44]I don't need to even play anymore.
[20:27.14]What about a Wet SpongeBob?
[20:37.10]Can you make Patrick?
[20:46.53]Seaweed?
[20:48.47]Kiss SpongeBob.
[20:49.69]Okay.
[20:51.91]Doesn't do anything.
[20:53.97]Oh, he's made a Krabby Patty.
[20:55.09]Krabby Patty SpongeBob?
[20:59.03]What about Krabby Patty and...
[21:04.82]Uh, mud.
[21:06.60]Muddy patty.
[21:08.48]Muddy patty and seaweed.
[21:10.10]Sushi.
[21:11.42]Sushi and crabby patty.
[21:13.93]Toadstool and Spongebob.
[21:17.17]Wait, Spongebob?
[21:17.89]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[21:26.76]I was gonna say, is it Peach and Spongebob?
[21:32.10]Does that make anything?
[21:33.42]Oh.
[21:34.34]Krabby Patty plus royalty?
[21:37.67]That's a good... Oh, it makes Burger King.
[21:40.43]Burger King and peach.
[21:42.35]Peach burger.
[21:43.47]Peach burger and sushi.
[21:45.19]Peach sushi.
[21:46.33]Peach sushi and bride.
[21:50.18]Princess and tree.
[21:54.16]Okay, this is ridiculous.
[21:58.94]How much stuff is there actually?
[22:04.20]Apple.
[22:04.76]Oh, okay.
[22:05.62]Apple pie.
[22:06.86]It's infinite.
[22:10.24]I feel like you're doing a whole stream on this.
[22:11.74]Just trying to find things.
[22:13.34]We'll come back to it.
[22:14.22]This is a long one.
[22:16.16]There's a lot of stuff to see.
[22:17.22]Hold on.
[22:17.56]Alright.
[22:17.82]That one was cool.
[22:18.92]I'm going to remember that one.
[22:21.14]Alright.
[22:21.34]I'm going to do it.
[22:21.78]I don't care.
[22:26.47]This is an idle game.
[22:31.21]You have to stimulate the click screen thing.
[22:35.16]Oh, we're about to hit the goal.
[22:39.12]7,100.
[22:40.88]Okay, you can add.
[22:41.50]So one plus one stimulation per bounce.
[22:44.69]And it costs three stimulation to do this.
[22:52.55]Alright.
[22:52.77]So the DVDs go into the core.
[22:54.41]Every time they bounce, I get one, right?
[22:58.46]Oh, man.
[22:59.10]I just like, I love this.
[23:02.57]What's this?
[23:03.07]Add tab title.
[23:04.61]It's good for SEO.
[23:07.34]Tab title?
[23:09.50]Oh, the actual tab on the... Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[23:11.66]What's going on?
[23:13.52]Give us more money.
[23:18.22]Button upgrade.
[23:18.76]Plus one stimulation per click.
[23:21.31]Oh, yeah.
[23:21.57]Let's do that.
[23:23.17]It's got a goofy sound now.
[23:24.21]Why is there this thing?
[23:24.99]What's this?
[23:25.51]Subway surfers.
[23:27.15]Plus three stimulation per second.
[23:36.59]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[23:40.29]It just fills the screen.
[23:41.33]This noise is a horrible.
[23:42.65]Can I like lower this?
[23:44.45]I mean, let me lower this for a second.
[23:51.07]Plus one.
[23:51.51]Okay.
[23:51.77]This amount animation.
[23:59.13]See your stimulation per second.
[24:02.95]Ah, more bounce, more simulation per bounce.
[24:08.26]Stay up to date with the latest news.
[24:11.56]Crits at a 5% chance.
[24:13.32]Oh my god, this is... I actually do have to turn this down for me.
[24:17.65]Yeah, let's do crits.
[24:30.45]Lo-fi?
[24:34.28]Oh shit, it actually is doing it.
[24:39.40]Hydraulic squish things slowly.
[25:00.43]How long does it last?
[25:01.45]Does this last forever?
[25:09.12]I got a new seed up there.
[25:10.72]Okay.
[25:12.54]Pinwheel.
[25:13.21]Popcorn.
[25:18.33]Ooh.
[25:25.20]Oh, you can see the crit happen.
[25:26.12]25 per crit.
[25:26.58]Alright.
[25:31.80]Here comes a hydraulic press.
[25:39.01]Crit build pops off late game.
[25:40.68]I would imagine, yeah.
[25:41.34]So what do you get for doing that?
[25:46.86]Nothing?
[25:47.08]Alright, I want this to be faster.
[25:54.12]Oh, it's a thousand.
[25:55.39]Okay, cool.
[25:55.95]Do it again.
[25:57.91]Achievements.
[26:02.35]I love this so much.
[26:06.47]Popcorn animation.
[26:11.31]Oh, cool.
[26:14.35]Dude, I'm high and this is scaring me.
[26:17.79]Hey, just listen to the... Okay, just mute the video and just put the audio on.
[26:31.80]Watch ASMR slime videos.
[26:34.78]Yes, for sure.
[26:45.72]Okay, faster hydraulic press.
[26:51.82]More DVDs.
[26:52.54]My computer is lagging.
[26:54.43]I'm actually kind of freezing.
[27:04.43]You can add thunder sounds.
[27:06.29]What achievement did I just get?
[27:07.35]Are you streaming on a Chromebook?
[27:13.16]No, I'm not streaming on a Chromebook.
[27:28.46]Okay, I'm going to wait till 10,000 stimulation.
[27:34.20]Your stream is lagging.
[27:35.62]It's only going to get worse from here.
[27:42.87]When I get to 10,000, I'll move on to do something.
[27:53.03]Oh, shit.
[27:53.75]Right.
[27:54.05]Thank you.
[27:58.97]I just spent all that on the hydraulic press.
[28:00.71]I don't know.
[28:01.41]Is that worth it?
[28:05.09]It's only 1000 every time.
[28:06.27]Can I upgrade and make it better?
[28:07.21]I'm gonna be really sad if I accidentally press the back button.
[28:27.29]It's worth finishing.
[28:30.38]What about the DVDs?
[28:32.14]Change color on bounce.
[28:38.51]I don't know how much I want to do.
[28:40.91]This is going to give me a fucking headache.
[28:43.07]But we'll see how long I can take it.
[28:52.81]It's only like 20 minutes.
[28:53.79]Okay, I'll weather it.
[28:59.39]Okay.
[29:00.58]What do I have?
[29:00.98]Anything I'm looking for?
[29:02.02]There's 35 achievements though.
[29:14.01]Did it do anything with the videos or did it just play the whole time?
[29:19.47]Just gave.
[29:19.81]Oh, we hit the goal.
[29:21.71]We just hit the goal.
[29:24.18]We're at $7,500 for Habitat for Humanity.
[29:28.12]For the greater LA area.
[29:30.03]This is... Alright.
[29:31.07]I'm going to have to make it something higher than this.
[29:35.77]Yeah, thank you guys.
[29:40.69]This money is going to relief efforts, so... Appreciate it.
[29:44.65]I'll leave the donating, whether it's a dollar.
[29:49.15]Doesn't matter what the amount is.
[29:59.71]Alright, let me change the goal.
[30:01.37]What should I make it?
[30:02.83]10?
[30:02.85]15?
[30:03.69]You think we can hit 15?
[30:13.20]You're rotting your brain right now.
[30:15.12]I think we can hit 15.
[30:16.14]Let's do 15.
[30:20.56]Give me one second.
[30:21.78]Let me just change this.
[30:25.41]I'm not going to close this window.
[30:31.50]Yeah, we'll set it to 15.
[30:32.32]Let's see if we can do that.
[30:35.00]I think we can.
[30:35.62]Let's fucking go.
[30:36.60]Come on.
[30:41.50]You don't think we can get 15k?
[30:43.03]I think we can get 15k.
[30:46.09]Also, I realize I'm talking a lot louder because this is so loud in my ears.
[30:53.47]It is so loud.
[30:54.75]I'm doing the thing where I'm like talking over the vacuum cleaner.
[30:57.31]Hold on a second.
[30:59.38]Let me lower this for me.
[31:01.31]It's low for you, it's not low for me.
[31:22.14]Yeah, there's some educational stuff on here, too.
[31:24.52]There's, um... Seems fun to do.
[31:27.34]Is this elevator one I want to see?
[31:28.59]Alright, I got 20,000 bucks.
[31:30.39]What do I do?
[31:33.47]Watch a guy eat.
[31:35.23]Plus 60 stimulation for a second.
[31:36.97]Hey, guys.
[31:37.73]Welcome back to another video.
[31:40.16]So, welcome to my garden.
[31:44.18]It's a beautiful...
[31:50.31]True crime podcast?
[31:57.36]Gain experience and level up.
[31:59.50]No eating, please.
[32:00.40]What do you mean no eat?
[32:01.78]I'm not eating.
[32:02.78]That guy over there is eating, not me.
[32:22.65]You need to get rid of the eating.
[32:23.83]I can't, I can't get rid of the eating.
[32:26.13]What a screen time.
[32:43.28]Oh, okay.
[32:43.70]I see.
[32:43.98]I was like, where is the pouring coming from?
[32:46.12]Okay.
[33:04.77]Oh, I want that.
[33:05.82]Okay.
[33:06.16]Alright.
[33:06.52]Alright.
[33:06.94]I'm going to, I'm going to get through this.
[33:07.96]I'm going to speed run this.
[33:09.38]Whoa.
[33:10.02]Hold on a second.
[33:10.56]Like monster amount of donations.
[33:11.76]We were at 7,500.
[33:12.06]We're at 9,200 right now.
[33:13.08]Over two, almost $2,000 have come in in the last two minutes.
[33:23.64]The magic mermaid of Mystic Bay.
[33:27.02]Then, on August 1st, 2012, everything changed.
[33:31.64]Somebody said, this is terrible.
[33:36.21]I need to, my baby sensory brain needs to get through this.
[33:40.41]We'll be alright.
[33:41.77]Mirabel Diaz.
[33:44.92]Frank Wilde, the longtime owner of Wild Tides Waterpark, is among the last to see her alive.
[33:55.75]Make this guy stop eating.
[33:57.05]I can't.
[33:58.09]I pressed it.
[33:58.93]Okay.
[33:59.21]Alright.
[34:02.22]I'll get that here.
[34:09.30]Wait, does it save your progress?
[34:11.78]It does.
[34:12.34]We're good.
[34:12.82]Alright.
[34:19.37]This is the password game.
[34:20.37]This is this one.
[34:20.89]I want to see this one.
[34:24.28]This is called the Space Elevator.
[34:26.14]Alright, now after getting stimulated for a little while.
[34:29.43]Everybody's chill.
[34:32.07]Put your heads back.
[34:34.23]And let's take a look and see what's going on in our world.
[34:36.53]Okay.
[34:39.37]The Space Elevator.
[34:40.27]This is where birds fly.
[34:45.50]This is where hot air balloons are.
[34:47.52]Welcome to the Space Elevator.
[34:48.84]The only elevator that goes to space.
[34:51.98]Currently in the troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere.
[34:59.76]99% of the water vapor in the atmosphere is here.
[35:03.52]Pigeons go this high?
[35:06.62]Pigeons fly higher than ducks?
[35:09.84]Or ospreys?
[35:14.69]Largest helicopter ever built.
[35:16.41]Was this 2,200 meters?
[35:23.16]Bald eagle, skydiver.
[35:25.44]See, this is crazy to me.
[35:27.87]How does a butterfly go this high?
[35:29.29]Doesn't that seem impossible?
[35:33.71]Science teacher, Andy.
[35:34.77]That's interesting.
[35:36.81]Why don't you learn something?
[35:42.48]It's a bit chilly.
[35:43.14]Pick a scarf.
[35:43.80]Alright, should I do red, orange, or blue?
[35:49.60]They can actually go twice as high as that.
[35:50.98]That's kind of crazy.
[35:59.10]I'm thinking blue.
[36:03.30]Cumulonimbus are tall towering clouds that can produce lightning, tornadoes, and hail.
[36:09.86]Pterodactyl?
[36:15.38]How do I?
[36:15.92]That's crazy that they can fly that high.
[36:20.64]They're so beautiful, too, when you see them in the sky.
[36:23.42]They're huge, too.
[36:24.10]So when you like, they actually kind of look like a plane.
[36:27.50]I'm actually glad that this showed it because they're I think they're like two to 300 feet long.
[36:33.23]They're beautiful in the air, though.
[36:34.75]They do this thing where they dive, they dive, they put their they tuck their wings into their arms here and they go straight down like a bullet.
[36:41.09]It's so if you get it, you can get it on camera.
[36:42.95]It's fucking awesome.
[36:46.61]Way cooler than a lot of the land ones that you see sometimes.
[36:52.16]Like the Tyrannosaurus and stuff.
[36:54.38]They're cool, but they're in the Sahara, so you don't really get to see them that often.
[37:04.41]How is a yak up here?
[37:10.22]I don't get it.
[37:10.64]Oh, you can play music.
[37:21.27]This is good music.
[37:21.89]I like this.
[37:25.21]Bees can go this high too.
[37:26.31]Fly catcher sand wart.
[37:39.52]Jump.
[37:39.98]Look at how high spiders can jump.
[37:46.07]That bee is lost.
[37:50.76]Another $2,000 have come in.
[37:54.28]You guys are going to crush a $15,000 goal.
[37:57.40]I haven't even been live for 30, 40 minutes.
[38:01.88]Awesome.
[38:02.74]Okay.
[38:07.42]Above this altitude is known as the death zone because there isn't enough oxygen for human life.
[38:12.96]There's enough oxygen for a swan, apparently.
[38:14.76]How does that make any sense?
[38:19.55]Mount Everest?
[38:25.53]They're just much smaller.
[38:26.73]Smaller bodies.
[38:27.55]Scale issue.
[38:29.81]You ever wondered where your lost balloons went?
[38:31.91]At this height, a typical party balloon will pop.
[38:36.67]Interesting.
[38:41.85]This is so weird to think about too.
[38:43.33]This is almost 10,000 meters.
[38:49.86]They can fly this high?
[38:51.00]I feel like there'd be no oxygen up here.
[38:52.58]I feel like they would be impossible.
[39:00.82]Ooh, music change.
[39:05.86]I remember I lost a Mario balloon one time and I cried.
[39:11.88]Yeah, true.
[39:13.70]Oh, spacesuit time.
[39:15.06]Now would be a good time to pick out your spacesuit.
[39:23.84]I think I like the one in the middle.
[39:27.13]Orange, white, or gray?
[39:30.81]Yeah, let's go with the classic.
[39:32.07]Classic, uh, classic fit.
[39:35.55]As air pressure drops out as the temperature needed to boil water, this altitude water boils at just 129 degrees Fahrenheit.
[39:47.35]What would it feel like to be up here?
[39:53.91]Jet streams are bands of strong winds in the atmosphere.
[39:56.49]And I'm not talking about be up there for a while.
[39:57.87]I'm talking about like dog putting head out car window for a second and just opening your mouth and just having your loose dog skin all over your mouth flap around and have your eyes wide open just for a second.
[40:16.80]You'd freeze to death instantly.
[40:21.72]Your blood would be boiled.
[40:23.50]You would lose your skin.
[40:27.48]Now, hold on, man.
[40:28.20]Roll the window down.
[40:28.98]Let me just, I want to do something.
[40:30.13]I've always wanted to do this.
[40:32.23]It's dangerous.
[40:32.93]No, just roll the window down.
[40:34.73]You put your head out there and all of a sudden, all the skin, all the tissue, all the, everything just melts and turns to dust in a half a second.
[40:40.93]And then you pull that guy out and it's just like, oh my God.
[40:47.00]Johnny's, Johnny's fucking head disintegrated.
[40:52.50]And it's just like a dummy.
[40:53.92]You know what I mean?
[40:55.24]That dummy body.
[40:58.62]You know the one.
[41:02.43]Don't worry, the elevator is pretty strong, I think.
[41:10.55]F-35 goes... Oh, the stratosphere.
[41:13.96]Welcome to the stratosphere.
[41:15.66]It's home to the ozone layer, which protects us from harmful UV rays.
[41:21.66]Unlike the troposphere, the temperature in the stratosphere increases the higher you go.
[41:26.43]1933 balloon altitude record.
[41:31.11]Balloons go really high.
[41:36.42]This is the Armstrong limit.
[41:38.08]Above this altitude, your saliva and tears will boil if you don't have a pressure suit.
[41:44.16]So I would have been fine down here.
[41:46.28]Everyone's saying that I would have been... No, we didn't get a little blip that said that you boil if you put your head out the window.
[41:58.19]A pressure suit.
[42:00.75]That freaks me out.
[42:05.92]Necreus clouds are rare clouds found in polar regions.
[42:09.11]They are made of small ice particles that scatter light in colorful ways.
[42:12.53]Ooh.
[42:15.81]Still going.
[42:16.48]Oh, here we go.
[42:17.00]Minus 68 degrees Fahrenheit.
[42:18.26]Yeah, you couldn't do that.
[42:19.12]Never mind.
[42:23.26]That's the Infinity... Spoilers for Infinity War.
[42:27.43]Marvel movie.
[42:29.48]What other movie would be called Infinity War?
[42:31.80]Um, when that guy that, oh yes, I would, you're just going to be so delicately.
[42:36.74]I would, I'll be tearing your skin off.
[42:39.30]That guy, remember when he goes outside?
[42:41.40]Is this where it is?
[42:42.25]Like here?
[42:51.29]As the air gets thinner, there are fewer molecules to scatter light.
[42:53.63]So the sky starts getting darker.
[42:57.95]Oh, dude.
[43:03.19]What?
[43:08.77]That has to be one of the most ridiculous experiences a single human could ever have.
[43:14.68]If you think about things that you could say happen to you... I don't think this happens to... You get to have this.
[43:23.56]You get to be the guy or girl that... This is somebody.
[43:31.45]And nobody else is going to do this, I don't think.
[43:38.05]Spy plane?
[43:38.79]A U2 spy plane?
[43:39.93]Douglas Skyrocket?
[43:44.06]Oh, oh, here we go.
[43:47.84]SR-71 is one of the fastest planes ever made.
[43:49.64]It can fly at over three times the speed of sound.
[43:59.43]Alright, what if you put your head out the window on this one?
[44:13.16]Your brain!
[44:14.62]Your brain!
[44:19.54]It would be an instant implosion!
[44:24.82]The temperature is getting warmer.
[44:27.04]Interesting.
[44:30.94]30,000 meters.
[44:41.18]Your brain would be sucked out of... Wait.
[44:43.66]Your brain would be sucked out... Nobody even said this, but I'm just combining three chat messages together.
[44:50.11]Your brain would be sucked out of its skull.
[44:52.71]Through the back of your head.
[44:53.89]Just like...
[44:59.51]1960 skydive out.
[45:00.81]Somebody skydove from here?
[45:02.39]30,000 meters skydive?
[45:15.40]Oh my goodness.
[45:17.30]With nothing but duct taped pressure suit.
[45:20.81]Joseph Kittinger jumped from an open gondola and set a record that would last for more than 50 years.
[45:30.92]Wait, has it been broken?
[45:31.98]Oh, no, no, no.
[45:34.40]1960.
[45:34.42]Oh, I see.
[45:34.78]It's a weather balloon.
[45:40.80]The ash cloud from the eruption that destroyed Pompeii reached this height.
[45:43.34]Damn.
[45:47.36]Highest paper airplane.
[45:48.76]Launched from a balloon, this is the highest paper airplane that has ever flown.
[45:57.34]Still traveling around somewhere.
[46:00.33]That one paper airplane.
[46:04.18]Just trying to find its way in space.
[46:06.46]Alone.
[46:08.38]We should have thrown two.
[46:13.90]First person to break the sound barrier in free fall.
[46:16.27]He reached a top speed of 843 miles per hour.
[46:18.67]Are you screaming during this?
[46:25.31]Do you scream during this or are you just kind of like, this is just, I'm just doing this.
[46:34.11]Break the sound barrier.
[46:35.85]Free falling.
[46:40.44]There's a video on this.
[46:41.60]Oh my God.
[46:43.60]Congratulations.
[46:44.24]You have made it to 0.01% to the moon.
[46:46.04]Look at the temperature.
[46:54.01]It's almost fine.
[46:59.29]The Castle Bravo nuclear test reached this altitude.
[47:02.61]Whoa.
[47:06.09]That's pretty high.
[47:09.43]So this is the current record for the highest skydive.
[47:13.33]Alan Eustace.
[47:15.44]41,496 meters.
[47:26.56]Wow.
[47:29.57]Space elevators are actually a possible idea being considered by scientists.
[47:34.71]could potentially offer a cheaper and safer way of getting to space I'm never going in that I don't want to I I I know it's not like this but I would envision this as the from willy wonka I don't want to do that I love that movie I love that character I love that actor
[47:55.61]That is a concept that is... I don't want to be trapped in a six foot by six foot glass box floating in space.
[48:05.44]You'll end up like the Superman villains.
[48:06.94]I'm not doing that.
[48:09.02]There's no way I'm floating around in space screaming and stuck up there for a hundred million years.
[48:12.94]No way.
[48:17.86]The hard part is making a strong enough cable and finding enough elevator music.
[48:26.48]I thought that was an owl.
[48:27.30]I was like, what are you doing up here?
[48:33.37]There's a space shuttle.
[48:35.07]This is where the boosters eject from the space shuttle.
[48:36.77]Cool.
[48:39.33]Oh, it's a turd.
[48:45.46]Thunders Mill Meteor.
[48:46.52]It's actually not bad right now.
[48:52.34]You could be out in space right here with a brisk jacket on, and you'd be fine.
[48:58.86]Well, besides all of your organs going inside out.
[49:02.24]But, you know, you'd be comfortable.
[49:04.37]Ooh.
[49:04.49]Ooh.
[49:21.45]So cool that you get to see stuff that, like... All of our inspiration for so many video game abilities and spells is just looking into the sky.
[49:35.68]How cool are we?
[49:41.47]The Mesosphere.
[49:42.33]Congratulations, you've reached the Mesosphere and are now halfway to space.
[49:45.39]Oh, we're not even... We just made it.
[49:48.95]I love this, though.
[49:49.47]I'm going to keep doing this.
[49:53.39]Less than 1% of the pressure as the air at sea level.
[50:02.80]The BU61 high altitude balloon record.
[50:15.50]The world's fastest elevator travels at 46 miles per hour.
[50:19.50]A space elevator with the same speed would take 80 minutes to reach space.
[50:24.04]That seems like not a lot of time at all.
[50:29.17]I guess if you could just go in a straight line.
[50:35.23]If a straight line up is, you could.
[50:40.06]That's pretty reasonable, I guess, yeah.
[50:44.21]50 that's like 50 miles that's fast yeah you are kind you are glued to the bottom of the elevator and your digestive system probably feels terrible yeah think about how you feel when you go up or down an elevator right now and those things move at like two miles per hour
[51:14.73]Just past $12,000.
[51:17.51]Habitat for Humanity.
[51:20.81]Hell yeah.
[51:21.25]Nice job, guys.
[51:23.23]I'm going to have to increase it again.
[51:32.60]If an elevator is a bit... What did you say?
[51:33.82]If an elevator is... If an elevator is a bit faster than regular, I get woozy.
[51:39.74]Yeah, you kind of feel like, it kind of feels like the... Your entire equilibrium gets so fried in an elevator that goes more than five miles per hour.
[51:54.55]Sounding rocket.
[51:55.71]Since weather balloons can't reach this height, rockets with sensors are used to learn more about the mesosphere.
[52:01.91]Oh, we're going cold again.
[52:06.40]Saturn V.
[52:15.04]The mushroom cloud from the largest ever nuclear test.
[52:17.64]What?
[52:20.22]Stop doing that!
[52:21.46]Don't do this anymore!
[52:23.52]This is- That's out-fucking-rageous!
[52:29.77]Wow.
[52:30.15]65,000 meters high?
[52:33.97]Into space?
[52:42.20]Something tells me if an explosion reaches into the mesosphere, we probably shouldn't ever do it under any circumstance.
[52:54.42]Ooh, I know this.
[52:55.74]These sprites are a rare form of lightning spotted over thunderstorms that only last a fraction of a second.
[53:01.70]These are so weird.
[53:03.18]They look like alien tendrils.
[53:07.91]They look like octopus in the sky.
[53:09.97]They're so weird.
[53:11.09]They're so fascinating.
[53:12.15]I love these things.
[53:21.52]This is a cool looking one, but if you go look at them, they look
[53:25.62]Almost eerie.
[53:26.44]They look menacing and strange and beautiful.
[53:30.84]It's wild.
[53:33.22]Sprites can reach lengths of up to 50 kilometers.
[53:38.02]The entire sky.
[53:45.11]Since the speed of sound depends on the temperature, sound travels 15% slower up here.
[53:54.54]Alright, so does that mean... Does that mean that if you're in space, everybody that's up in space, if they're this high, does everybody kind of have a voice that sounds like this?
[54:06.95]Does everybody kind of talk like this to each other?
[54:12.37]No, that's frequency.
[54:16.84]That would be funny, though.
[54:19.22]No one is talking in this... Okay, if you... If you talked into a device that could take the temperature and take the pressure and press play... Would it be like this?
[54:33.37]If I said this, would it go... If I said this... No, it just travels slower.
[54:45.55]So it would be more like having a 15% delay before you heard it.
[54:50.84]So if it'd be like, if I said hi, you'd see my lips say hi.
[54:54.72]And then like 15% later than normal, you'd hear it.
[54:59.34]It's laggy.
[55:01.44]Yeah.
[55:04.36]Noctilucent, noctilucent clouds are the highest altitude clouds in the atmosphere.
[55:11.19]They are the only visible at night and at high latitudes.
[55:18.85]Oh, by the way, I want to change everybody's life.
[55:21.29]Go to your mouse settings.
[55:22.47]Go to your cursor settings and change this shit.
[55:26.86]This has changed everything for me.
[55:31.04]Being able to have the mouse dynamically turn.
[55:35.56]Different colors, depending what the background is.
[55:37.73]You should do it right now.
[55:41.21]That was in Windows 98.
[55:42.15]I just found it a week ago or like a year ago.
[55:46.47]So.
[55:50.13]Most meteors burn up in the Mesosphere.
[55:51.79]It's estimated that over 48 tons of meteors hit the atmosphere every day.
[55:58.68]V2 rocket, Falcon 9.
[56:03.26]This is the coldest part of Earth's atmosphere of negative 120 degrees Fahrenheit.
[56:11.23]You know the name like thermosphere.
[56:12.65]It's about to get pretty ugly.
[56:16.72]Final layer.
[56:18.74]At a hundred kilometers high, the Karman line is usually accepted as the start of outer space.
[56:24.83]Temperatures in the thermosphere can reach 4,500 degrees Fahrenheit, but molecules are so far apart that you wouldn't even feel it.
[56:37.89]Cool.
[56:39.49]On the way to space.
[56:40.89]Vostok 1 is on the way to space.
[56:45.53]As particles from the sun hit the atmosphere, they excite the atoms in the air.
[56:49.73]These excited atoms start to glow, creating the brilliant display of light called auroras.
[56:55.64]Oh.
[57:00.88]This is a great education stream.
[57:04.76]Yeah, it's not all about just drawing circles and... You know.
[57:13.88]Thousand humans, fewer than a thousand fumes have... I can't read.
[57:18.34]You're about to reach a place where... Oh, I can't read.
[57:20.84]You are about to reach a place fewer than 1,000 humans have ever been.
[57:27.33]Now leaving Earth.
[57:29.69]The car man line.
[57:34.51]Wow.
[57:36.91]So less than a thousand people have crossed it.
[57:40.35]Very cool.
[57:44.76]That was great.
[57:45.96]I very much enjoyed that.
[57:49.35]Okay.
[57:49.93]What else we got?
[57:51.87]Password game.
[57:53.67]Design the next iPhone.
[57:55.32]Absurd trolley problems.
[57:59.89]Oh, it's this.
[58:00.53]Okay, let me just go ahead and do my technique here.
[58:02.83]My technique for the trolley problem is this.
[58:04.97]I pull it every fucking single time.
[58:06.35]I'm not playing your game.
[58:07.63]You have 10 things lined up here.
[58:09.09]10 things lined up is 10 choices.
[58:11.37]I'm pulling it every time.
[58:12.61]I'm not playing your game.
[58:14.03]I'm going to go run and say, I'm pulling them all.
[58:15.39]And you're going to go, no, no, no, no, wait, don't do that.
[58:17.86]No, you're supposed to hear the horrible fucking terrible, terrible, crazy situation for why you would not or why you would pull.
[58:23.60]And I go, well, no, I'm just pulling them all.
[58:25.70]I'm going to run down the, I'm going to pull them all.
[58:29.43]Guarantee that stops this madness once and for all.
[58:44.86]That's not defensible in court.
[58:49.00]What do you mean?
[58:49.66]Me saying...
[58:57.86]Or you just, you choose.
[58:59.56]Oh no, a trolley is heading towards five people.
[59:06.26]You can pull the lever to divert it to the other track, but then your life savings will be destroyed.
[59:10.34]What do you do?
[59:11.06]Wait a minute.
[59:17.69]I have to pull them off.
[59:25.99]Wow, 58% or only 42% disagree.
[59:27.27]Holy shit.
[59:27.61]Oh my God.
[59:41.13]That's a lot.
[59:42.55]Oh, no, a trolley is heading towards five people.
[59:44.37]You can pull the lever to divert it to the other track.
[59:46.95]No, no, no, no, no.
[59:47.61]I'm not going to go.
[59:48.37]I'm not going to run down this aisle of trolley problems, pulling every single one of them and then lay on the track.
[59:58.40]I don't like I said I was going to follow all.
[60:03.44]While 38% of people agree, 62% would be like, no, fuck that.
[60:11.31]Here's the thing, though.
[60:12.11]How many people are saying this?
[60:15.36]I would do it.
[60:17.40]I feel like there's like an altruism buff on this.
[60:22.02]Where it's probably like 10% more.
[60:31.50]You can pull a lever, divert it to the other track, but then the original copy of the Mona Lisa will be destroyed.
[60:40.39]I'm curious about this one.
[60:45.61]The, yeah, the, the, the main LA the main lasso is up here.
[60:51.11]Well, I said I was running by pulling them all.
[60:52.55]Let's see 70.
[60:56.67]Wow.
[60:57.07]That's a high number.
[60:58.03]That's pretty super majority.
[61:05.78]Oh no, a trolley is heading towards a rich man.
[61:07.26]The rich man offers you $500,000 to pull the lever, which would divert the trolley.
[61:11.78]Oh no, I said I was going to pull them all.
[61:20.94]I said I wasn't going to play this game.
[61:22.54]Alright, well...
[61:34.50]It's your life savings.
[61:41.99]Full of do nothing.
[61:44.39]Oh, no.
[61:48.79]See, this one's very interesting.
[61:52.21]55% disagree.
[61:56.65]Okay, what if... Does he... Okay, but here's the thing.
[61:59.05]Does he yell that to me?
[62:04.65]Does he go, I'll give you $500,000 if you pull the lever?
[62:07.63]You talk about admissible in court.
[62:10.62]I want... Funny you said $500,000.
[62:13.32]I want $5 million.
[62:14.02]$500,000?
[62:14.80]No, I want $5 million to even consider it.
[62:19.76]And...
[62:31.55]$4 million is going to this dude and his entire lineage.
[62:44.88]Oh no, a trolley sending five lobsters.
[62:46.76]You can pull the lever to divert it to the other track running over a cat.
[62:51.25]Oh no.
[62:52.19]Oh no.
[63:06.76]I'm sorry, lobsters.
[63:10.82]I'm sorry.
[63:12.86]We don't... We gotta respect the fucking sea creatures a little more.
[63:16.48]I mean, that was... You know what's crazy?
[63:19.04]That was an easy decision for me.
[63:21.02]You know what I mean?
[63:22.88]And apparently 84% of every other person as well.
[63:33.36]Oh no!
[63:34.34]Oh my god!
[63:40.50]out of here I'm getting out of here I'm getting out of here it wouldn't have been that bad if they didn't show they weren't like sleeping alright let's design the next iPhone twelve thousand six hundred and forty three dollars total going to habitat for humanity greater la
[64:07.48]It's going to be benefiting relief efforts for the fires in LA.
[64:12.52]You're just joining us.
[64:14.82]It's through Tiltify.
[64:15.79]So there's a Tiltify link.
[64:17.19]There's a PID message.
[64:18.55]There is, uh, I think the mods are putting it in the chat every so often too.
[64:22.43]Alright, let's design the next iPhone.
[64:26.29]Do you, I'm going to do this the way that I would want to do it by the way.
[64:33.75]Okay.
[64:35.53]First of all, I have a couple of complaints.
[64:39.55]Uh, I don't give a shit about this.
[64:42.59]I don't care about it.
[64:47.01]And I just put it on and I don't think I can delete it.
[64:52.28]I don't want a bunch of cameras.
[64:56.22]I look fine.
[64:56.92]I like a little dual camera is fine.
[65:03.13]Volume button always goes, I would say, on the right side of the phone, like right here.
[65:08.29]Like that.
[65:13.63]That's volume up, volume down.
[65:18.31]Cool.
[65:18.77]Okay.
[65:21.44]Yeah, I want a port.
[65:22.36]I want more than that.
[65:23.50]Okay.
[65:23.76]I want more.
[65:24.30]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[65:24.98]Wait a minute.
[65:25.30]Wait a minute.
[65:25.70]I don't care about this.
[65:26.44]Get rid of this fucking thing.
[65:31.21]I just want a tiny little camera.
[65:33.03]I don't want one of these.
[65:35.87]I don't care about 500,000 megapixels.
[65:43.93]Alright, lightning port.
[65:45.83]I might change that in a minute.
[65:48.49]What are the notch?
[65:49.31]What's that for?
[65:51.67]Oh, eh.
[65:54.77]Nah, I want the screen real estate.
[65:58.21]Apple logo?
[65:59.03]Nah.
[66:01.30]What's it look like?
[66:14.73]What about the headphone Jack?
[66:16.11]I'm going.
[66:16.65]Don't worry.
[66:17.15]Don't worry.
[66:17.63]Please put the Android logo on too.
[66:20.95]Yeah, this is cross platform.
[66:22.49]It works on anything works on this.
[66:30.81]OK, home button, we're bringing the home button back.
[66:32.55]OK, power button is going to I'm going to tell you where I put the power button.
[66:41.92]And I don't know why it's not here.
[66:46.90]Because I do you know how many times I've been on the phone because the power buttons like here.
[66:53.33]And you're just on the phone, you're moving around, I've pressed this button so many times and like hung up on people and shit.
[67:04.66]I don't like this being here.
[67:08.70]You are not going to be grasping the top of the phone here.
[67:12.93]You grasp around here.
[67:17.99]I don't know why that, and I, by the way, I don't know why the power button does anything besides just like turn the power off or turn the power on.
[67:26.56]Silencer.
[67:30.08]What is this?
[67:30.52]What the hell is this?
[67:32.36]Oh, right.
[67:35.23]That's fine over here.
[67:36.85]I don't have a problem with it being here.
[67:45.69]Single camera.
[67:49.18]Click wheel.
[67:50.04]Oh, we can do a click wheel?
[67:53.88]Dude, this is actually kind of cool.
[67:55.14]Alright, I want that.
[68:04.19]Headphone Jack.
[68:06.64]Yep.
[68:07.08]Bringing the headphone Jack back.
[68:09.94]Oh, dude.
[68:10.52]Bass.
[68:11.30]Oh, yeah.
[68:12.10]Pog.
[68:12.55]He did it.
[68:13.17]Oh, man.
[68:13.93]This is why I love Jerma.
[68:15.51]This is why I like the stream.
[68:16.77]Dude, of course he would do that.
[68:30.22]I'm just kidding.
[68:31.12]Fuck all of you.
[68:33.03]Putting a fucking HDMI slot on here.
[68:35.25]Gonna make it even worse than it is.
[68:42.87]A pro stand?
[68:43.95]Oh, whoops, hold on.
[68:52.84]Actually, actually, this would be, I would not even care if this was like this.
[68:59.10]It would take the water rating from the phone.
[69:02.83]You would not be able to get, what is it, IP something something?
[69:06.53]The water damage rating.
[69:09.01]But I feel like that might be kind of cool.
[69:18.08]It's making a motherboard.
[69:19.18]Digital crown, what is that?
[69:27.24]Googly eyes?
[69:28.19]No, that's... Wait, I can do pro feet?
[69:44.34]would you ever do this?
[69:47.88]What benefit does this give you?
[69:49.71]I guess he could sit it on a table, but why would anybody have this?
[70:20.09]No, no, no, no, no.
[70:20.69]The antennas are better arms.
[70:45.65]This arm's too high.
[70:57.61]Well, I got the volume indicators.
[70:58.99]It's whatever.
[70:59.65]Man, designing products is hard.
[71:04.37]Okay.
[71:15.48]That's his nose.
[71:16.46]He's going to have a big nose.
[71:22.38]This is a D-pad.
[71:30.11]I get this off.
[71:31.17]This is turning into this shit show on pro wheel.
[71:49.51]Cool.
[71:49.77]Alright, cup holder.
[72:01.67]There's no cups going in there.
[72:03.40]Dude, how about a pro max camera?
[72:20.15]What do you say?
[72:20.75]I'm not even looking in chat at all.
[72:25.71]What is the devil is this?
[72:29.93]This is designing the new iPhone.
[72:37.58]That's his hair.
[72:44.94]Oh, there we go.
[72:45.68]Now it's perfect.
[72:46.48]In case you're gaming.
[72:59.61]Can I just, okay, can I put another screen here?
[73:05.87]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[73:06.65]Let me redo this, because I want this to be a... This is not a lens.
[73:09.97]This is a different screen.
[73:21.96]This is where you can play, like, games on it.
[73:25.32]Alright, I think that's pretty good.
[73:30.12]The all-new iPhone.
[73:31.45]Starting at...
[73:35.08]$4,475.
[73:35.18]That was cute.
[73:41.64]I like that one.
[73:46.35]Is this one?
[73:47.23]There's a lot.
[73:47.69]Wait, wait, wait.
[73:49.69]How about let's settle this.
[73:53.43]Internet debates have raged for too long.
[73:54.91]It's time to settle the big questions so we can move on.
[73:58.69]How do you pronounce GIF?
[74:08.62]It's not GIF.
[74:11.66]It's GIF.
[74:12.42]It's a GIF.
[74:14.14]Is the dress blue and black or white and gold?
[74:22.87]Uh, this dress is, oh, this fucking dress thing, right?
[74:26.12]Um, I mean, it's blue and gold.
[74:37.13]So neither one of these make any sense to me.
[74:40.49]It's blue and black.
[74:42.55]That's a lighting thing.
[74:43.59]It's an optical illusion.
[74:45.74]But it's blue and black, and that's what I see.
[74:49.32]What came first, chicken or the egg?
[74:51.40]The egg had to come first because the egg has to hatch the chicken.
[74:56.86]So therefore, the egg has to come first.
[75:01.26]The only way the egg had to have developed on its own...
[75:09.42]Chickens evolving into chickens imply all that evolution.
[75:17.09]Egg came first.
[75:21.25]But who laid the egg?
[75:23.27]It was a concoction of molecules over millions of years and single-cell, multi-cell organisms that found their way into each other.
[75:33.31]And they created a yolk.
[75:35.54]And they all agreed that we were going to be yellow.
[75:38.56]We were going to be orange or yellow.
[75:40.38]And they all agreed on it.
[75:41.20]They all pressed their big green button that said, yes, it was 20 of them.
[75:46.34]Should a sandwich be cut diagonally or horizontally?
[75:48.12]And nobody fucking knows the answer to this question.
[75:49.68]Nobody has any idea what's going on.
[75:53.62]Guys, they're still digging up things from... Oh, wow.
[75:57.14]Archaeologists found another civilization from 45,000 years ago.
[76:03.33]And apparently they wore hats and had primitive ovens.
[76:08.13]We're going to learn a lot of shit about stuff.
[76:12.15]It's horizontal.
[76:20.00]Is cereal a soup?
[76:21.28]No.
[76:22.12]No.
[76:26.06]It's not a soup.
[76:32.52]Soup is a porridge or something.
[76:36.82]Is it a soup?
[76:37.62]I don't know.
[76:38.22]But it's semantics.
[76:38.90]We're playing semantics.
[76:41.56]It's like, okay, is a taco a sandwich?
[76:46.02]Is a hot dog a sandwich?
[76:46.99]Is a taco a sandwich?
[76:48.33]These are the questions that... It's just semantics.
[76:57.51]I'm very, very, very, very kind of adamant about this one.
[77:03.34]It's over every time.
[77:05.56]I don't understand how anybody could press this because your toilet paper is going against the wall.
[77:10.00]When you pull it down, you are scraping the wall with the toilet paper.
[77:18.01]If there's people in this chat right now that are under Andy's, try this way and understand.
[77:29.08]Pepsi or Coke?
[77:29.76]Coke every time.
[77:31.86]What?
[77:34.35]Wait, did I click?
[77:34.89]What did I click?
[77:38.25]Okay, now, wait, did I click Pepsi?
[77:41.11]Why is it?
[77:41.67]Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[77:44.47]Is pineapple on pizza good?
[77:47.16]No, but yeah.
[77:49.18]No, it's not.
[77:50.76]Not for me.
[77:52.73]Star Wars or Star Trek.
[77:56.19]This one like kind of started to do some interesting things.
[77:58.67]This one got like way worse.
[78:07.06]It's crazy because 10 years ago, if you had told me that Star Trek was better than Star Wars, I would have taken a drag of the whole cigarette.
[78:18.05]I would have done the whole thing.
[78:20.00]In one go, I would put it out, I would have blown the smoke out, and then you and I are having a fucking linguistic battle for an hour and a half straight about why you are so fucking wrong.
[78:30.85]And that anything from Star Trek that was remotely interesting was back when, back in like the, I want to say like the 90s, like the 70s to the 90s.
[78:47.29]Star Wars started to, oh, now we're going to do the prequels.
[78:50.28]People hate the prequels.
[78:51.26]That's fine.
[78:53.82]I liked Star Wars until like six years ago.
[78:58.99]And yeah, I got older, obviously.
[79:00.95]Maybe that's part of it too.
[79:04.01]Would a dog wear pants like this or like this?
[79:15.28]This one is correct, but it looks awful.
[79:17.68]But this one is also awful.
[79:23.12]This one to me, it comes across as way too goofy.
[79:30.10]For this one, I would imagine that the dog is standing up in a pair of jeans.
[79:37.62]This, I'm going with this one.
[79:43.29]Jack have fit on the door in the movie Titanic.
[79:46.69]I don't know.
[79:47.05]I don't know.
[79:54.26]I've never seen this movie.
[79:56.02]Yes.
[79:57.36]Alright.
[79:58.70]Are hot dogs a sandwich?
[79:59.92]Yes, they are.
[80:00.92]They are.
[80:02.08]But like, I don't believe that, but it is.
[80:05.40]It's bread.
[80:06.27]It's some kind of a meat or some kind of a substance mushed between bread that you eat.
[80:16.25]Uh, Ooh, I like Batman, but that's kind of it.
[80:38.94]Should we get rid of daylight savings?
[80:40.14]Yes.
[80:43.56]Xbox or PlayStation.
[80:44.68]Oh man.
[80:56.09]Nowadays, it's this one, but years ago, it was this one.
[81:02.75]Although, not really, though.
[81:05.39]When I say nowadays, I mean like the last... I'm thinking like the PS4, PS5 era versus the Xbox One... I don't know, Xbox One, 360, PS3, PS4.
[81:21.94]I'm going to go PlayStation.
[81:23.62]That's surprising.
[81:24.34]Well, I would have thought it would be much higher.
[81:27.54]I'm thinking of the PS4, mostly.
[81:29.82]PS5 is fine.
[81:32.05]I'm going to go PlayStation.
[81:38.21]Are we living in a simulation?
[81:40.03]That's an interesting question.
[81:43.60]The correct answer is I don't know.
[81:47.03]But, um, uh, there was a dick on my wall one day, uh, from the sun and I, I didn't do it.
[81:55.23]And sometimes it's hard to argue about it.
[81:57.46]It's like, why, what happened?
[82:01.54]Are we living, are we living in a simulation?
[82:03.08]Yeah.
[82:03.22]When I, you know, when I, when I say, um, like, oh man, like we need to get some more dog food.
[82:07.96]And then like dog food shows up on my phone in an ad.
[82:13.30]You tell me.
[82:18.29]Is Die Hard a Christmas movie?
[82:22.17]Yes.
[82:26.25]Middle brownie piece or edge piece?
[82:28.16]Edge every time.
[82:30.82]Oh.
[82:32.72]How many of you are not living the brownie edge life?
[82:40.14]Brownie edges, they're kind of hard to bite through, but when you get through it, you get that dense chew.
[82:50.17]It's a dense chew where you bite, and you push your teeth through, and it's gritty, and it's the chocolatiest part of the whole brownie.
[83:02.42]Sock, shoe, sock, shoe, or sock, sock, shoe, shoe.
[83:08.02]Oh, yuck, this one.
[83:11.50]Huh?
[83:19.12]Oh, I'm misreading these.
[83:21.34]I think that's my answer with everybody else.
[83:26.78]Like I thought, I think that's, oh, you answered this and this is whatever.
[83:29.16]Okay.
[83:29.30]I get it.
[83:29.90]So it's both the bars.
[83:33.17]iPhone and Android.
[83:34.09]I mean, I really don't care.
[83:37.57]I just don't care.
[83:38.45]They're phones.
[83:39.13]It's a telephone.
[83:44.45]Oh, we did just make the new one.
[83:47.69]Does a straw have one hole or two?
[83:49.29]It's one gigantic hole through the whole thing.
[83:52.85]Smooth or chunky peanut butter?
[83:56.92]Hmm.
[83:57.00]I'm going to say smooth.
[84:04.56]I did it.
[84:08.14]For a second, I was like, oh, this is also part of this.
[84:12.33]It's not.
[84:20.14]It's like, oh, what are these other little games down here?
[84:21.74]Alright, there you go.

[85:42.05]You can make your own custom sleep track on this website.
[85:45.38]That's cool.
[85:47.86]That's every Duncan in Massachusetts.
[85:56.88]Well, my audio is messed up.
[85:59.10]I'm not hearing this correctly.
[86:00.18]Okay.

[86:24.82]Just max them all.
[86:30.57]What about train station?
[86:39.31]Dentist?
[86:51.56]Maxing them all would be horrible.
[87:02.51]Yeah, they're gonna mow the casino floor.
[87:09.93]If I'm not maxing them all out, why do you guys want to go just automatically right to the most horrible thing?

[88:41.42]I'm going to put them all as high as they can go, OK?
[88:56.68]No, I could turn it down for me.
[88:58.42]It's too loud for me.
[89:07.55]Is that a horse?
[89:12.86]I can't take it anymore.
[89:14.26]I can't take it.
[89:14.70]It's too much.
[89:15.42]It's too much.
[89:25.26]Now everything needs to be lower than the couple arguing.
[89:37.07]Come on down.
[90:04.00]The horses.
[90:04.80]Alright, I'm just, whatever, fuck it, who cares.
[90:37.01]I can't do that.
[90:38.13]I can't.
[90:38.57]I physically can't do it.
[90:42.56]Okay, what about rocks?
[90:50.22]Ooh.

[92:14.64]We are approaching the $15,000 goal.
[92:16.82]You guys are doing amazing.
[92:23.48]Thank you.
[92:32.30]What is the actual technique to do this?
[92:37.88]You need to be very, very patient.
[92:40.06]You need to wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, right?
[92:55.81]This one's a little too heavy on the right.
[92:57.79]Wait, I think I got it.
[93:14.08]You hear... No, guys, sorry.
[93:24.40]I don't do this on the beach.

[94:47.29]I think that looks good.
[94:53.58]No.
[94:55.38]Come on.
[94:55.94]Alright.
[94:58.04]Last one and I got it.

[95:54.99]So is this what it got sold for when it got purchased?
[96:03.64]Or is this what it's worth now?

[107:24.21]Oh, whoops.
[107:27.51]Yeah, it goes all the way down.
[107:32.11]Draw the Nike logo.
[107:35.39]It goes like this, right?
[107:40.05]It's like Nike.
[108:10.87]The Apple logo.

[108:12.68]I know this by heart.
[108:13.50]I'm such a Omega fan.
[108:38.27]I don't know why I added the stem.
[108:40.31]It's just a leaf.
[108:41.31]There's no stem in the Apple logo.
[108:44.79]Oh, dear.
[108:45.51]The Starbucks logo is fucked.
[108:47.65]Okay.
[108:53.23]It's like a lady.
[108:54.65]She's like this.
[109:03.38]And then it's like...
[109:08.69]And there's her hands.
[109:13.05]And there's like a coffee cup in the middle.
[109:15.25]There's like an S on the cup.
[109:27.27]I think there's an S on the cup.
[109:37.96]Starbucks I don't even like Starbucks I don't drink Starbucks oh my god this is like what happens oh wow he gave this famous artist LSD and told him to draw us the Starbucks logo wow wow this is unbelievable this is what happens after the artist took like a bunch of like fucking drugs and like the cocaine and heroin and stuff that's unbelievable what an interesting thing to look at
[110:05.88]Amazon.
[110:06.92]I know the Amazon logo very, very well.
[110:10.40]Because back in the day, this is how I used to back if you go to I don't really go to conventions really anymore.
[110:17.05]But when I did go to conventions, people would come up to me say, Oh, can you sign my badge?
[110:21.39]Or can you sign this?
[110:22.25]Absolutely.
[110:22.71]I would love to.
[110:24.11]This is how I would do it.
[110:34.34]I would put a like a line underneath it.
[110:37.22]And I just realized I was doing the Amazon logo.
[110:40.58]So I stopped doing it.
[110:44.92]I don't know why.
[110:45.92]I don't know why I did it.
[110:46.76]I, anytime, look, if you want to come up with a, a signature or something, or a way that you do it, that nobody else does it like that.
[110:55.70]Cause so look, that's the little signature that you have.
[111:00.28]You kind of, I don't know, you kind of just can't make it up for no reason.
[111:04.06]That's what I, this is me trying to make up a like signature way, like a signature style to sign things.
[111:10.75]And the reason why you do that is so you can do it quickly.
[111:14.99]You can do it easy.
[111:16.17]You can do it the same pretty much every time.
[111:18.05]That's why people have like a signature.
[111:22.07]But I stopped doing that.
[111:25.38]Because, yeah, it was like, it started to kind of turn into that.
[111:35.84]Oh no, Pepsi.
[111:41.69]Pepsi, isn't it like... Isn't it like something like this?
[111:51.14]And isn't it like half colored in?
[111:56.68]No, is it all colored in?
[112:02.14]Isn't it blue in the Pepsi?
[112:03.37]It's like blue and red, right?
[112:34.76]This is supposed to be a guy with eyes bugging out of his head going, Whoa!
[112:40.17]Where's the blue?
[112:41.49]Oh, I, I, okay.
[112:43.03]I fucked it up.
[112:43.77]I knew there was blue.
[112:44.67]I thought I could only use the red.
[112:47.39]Oh shit.
[112:48.15]I'm an idiot.
[112:50.45]It's X now.
[113:09.62]Isn't it a bell?
[113:10.26]I feel like it's ringing too.
[113:26.61]It's like ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[113:33.39]NASA logo.
[113:39.03]Oh boy.
[114:10.76]It's I think, wait, isn't it like a rocket ship?
[114:17.17]I think it's a rocket ship, isn't it?
[114:26.00]Isn't it like, like NASA and then there's a rocket flying underneath it.
[114:33.98]Like, I don't know this somehow.
[115:02.97]No, dude, this is IHOP?
[115:04.41]What?
[115:04.63]It is IHOP.
[115:08.33]That's the IHOP logo.
[115:10.36]Oh, that is the IHOP logo.
[115:12.42]It's innocent.
[115:13.16]I knew there was this red shit.
[115:14.76]I knew it.
[115:15.28]I told you there was this red shit everywhere.
[115:16.90]It's IHOP.
[115:26.78]Okay, Google logo.
[115:28.06]It's just, isn't it just like a G?
[115:29.96]Oh, they did all this dumb shit, didn't they?
[115:32.68]Yeah, it's like... Oh.
[115:50.31]Well, that's the app version.
[115:51.97]It's the abbreviated app version.
[115:55.70]Android logo.
[115:56.46]It's a little robot.
[115:57.68]I don't know exactly what he looks like though.
[116:36.31]I just was fucking around.
[116:37.40]These are supposed to be arms on his sides.
[116:41.10]And he's being very sassy about it.
[116:45.32]I don't even use Spotify, so I don't know.
[116:52.41]Isn't it like this?
[117:13.54]It was, I got it.
[117:17.45]Yeah, sorry.
[117:18.79]This, that's the best one.
[117:20.23]The fucking IHOP logo.
[117:21.35]That's so stupid.
[117:37.58]Got to add that part, right?
[118:05.44]I like this one a lot.
[118:06.36]I wish there were more.
[118:07.62]This one was, this is my favorite one so far.
[118:13.94]Okay, progress.
[118:17.50]Next minute.
[118:19.01]Next hour.
[118:19.93]Oh, it's one of these.
[118:26.09]Next year, next month.
[118:29.07]Next, hey, next Valentine's Day.
[118:30.95]That's pretty close.
[118:34.13]Easter, Mother's Day.
[118:38.39]I got to be really honest with everybody here.
[118:39.99]This is a great way to remind yourself when things are actually coming up.
[118:44.91]Like, oh, hey, Father's Day is in like 41 days.
[118:48.67]Like, oh, shit.
[118:49.25]Okay.
[118:53.05]That's cute.
[118:55.99]Next new moon.
[118:57.33]Next waxing crescent.
[119:02.54]Whoa, full moon tonight.
[119:05.10]Full moon tonight, boys and girls.
[119:13.06]Next decade, next century, next Malenia.
[119:15.42]Halley's Comet returns.
[119:20.10]36 years.
[119:21.94]Chernobyl is fully safe again in 175 years.
[119:25.21]Damn.
[119:28.51]Why is this almost all the way?
[119:34.24]Oh my God.
[119:34.88]4 billion years left.
[119:42.90]I have a question for everybody in chat.
[119:47.02]Do you think that Michael Jackson's Beat It will be something that people still reference a billion years from now?
[120:05.63]Do you think the Frappuccino still exists?
[120:10.09]Why wouldn't it, though?
[120:22.98]What's going to last?
[120:26.23]What's going to be the thing that they do the dinosaur digging up on us?
[120:32.14]What is going to be our version of the dinosaur bones in the ground?
[120:37.04]It's going to be trash.
[120:38.46]They're actually true.
[120:40.12]Actually true.
[120:44.97]A bunch of plastic and fucking steel wires and shit.
[120:56.51]Yeah.
[120:58.05]Oh, man.
[120:58.51]That's...
[121:01.36]I was hoping one of you guys, I was hoping we were all going to agree it was going to be, I don't know, like one of our most taken care of mountain ranges.
[121:10.23]No, it's going to be plastic.
[121:12.69]We're going to be made out of it.
[121:18.35]The baby map.
[121:20.15]What else we got here?
[121:21.45]The size of space.
[121:24.90]Printing money.
[121:28.30]$7.25 an hour.
[121:29.06]$16 an hour.
[121:31.20]Oh, it's counting as they go by.
[121:35.00]Oh, my God.
[121:43.36]Oh, you can put... Oh, okay.
[121:45.50]I'm curious.
[121:45.92]What if you do like... What if it's like a million dollars?
[121:52.52]Okay.
[121:53.22]Not that much.
[121:58.81]Twitter revenue.
[121:59.65]Okay.
[121:59.81]This, this is each one of these is a thousand.
[122:01.65]So this is $350,000 an hour is what Twitter makes in revenue.
[122:07.26]NASA spends $2.5 million an hour.
[122:14.96]Facebook takes in $8 million an hour.
[122:22.74]This is ridiculous.
[122:26.38]I feel like if you feel like on the
[122:28.96]I feel like if I was like a high up Amazon employee or like a Walmart employee, I feel like I'd be like, what the fuck is going on right now?
[122:36.72]Like what the fuck is happening?
[122:42.24]Yeah, this is crazy.
[122:53.21]US military spending $84 million an hour.
[122:57.43]And then of course the deficit.
[123:00.66]We increase our deficit by $125 million an hour.
[123:04.64]Dude, Walmart almost makes the same amount of money an hour that the US military spends.
[123:23.70]These are like right next to each other.
[123:28.72]That's fucking crazy.
[123:34.78]Oh, what else we got here?
[123:40.36]Okay, back up here.
[123:41.48]There's a lot of things.
[123:45.35]Do the size of space, size of space.
[123:46.95]Okay.
[123:48.23]Use the right arrow key or swipe left to start.
[123:50.21]I'll use the arrow key.
[123:52.33]Why not?
[123:56.33]Astronaut.
[124:00.54]Mm-hmm.
[124:04.84]I don't know.
[124:05.44]I always feel like the space shuttle was bigger for some reason.
[124:13.00]Saturn V rocket.
[124:19.71]The moon of Mars.
[124:23.81]It's not even that big.
[124:26.99]It really isn't.
[124:29.78]I feel like you could walk from one end of this planet to the other one.
[124:38.95]Well, it's not a planet, I know.
[124:40.11]I'm going to get literally my face ripped off of that.
[124:46.54]243 Ida.
[124:51.38]Vesta.
[124:52.36]Asteroid.
[124:56.28]Where's Jupiter in this, I wonder?
[124:59.62]Make make.
[125:03.78]There's Pluto.
[125:05.40]Europa.
[125:07.90]The moon.
[125:11.52]I'm not sure I've ever asked this question or even bothered to look it up.
[125:14.78]You know, there's like a piece of information that you just don't really have ever cared to look up or be told or remember or retain.
[125:21.45]How big actually is the moon?
[125:23.35]If you were to drive, if you were to start driving on one of the top of the moon to get to the bottom of the moon, if you were to drive from here to here, how long is that?
[125:35.75]How long of a drive is that?
[125:45.43]couple of hours so you effectively the length it takes for me to drive yeah like I'm trying to think of like to go across like if I was to drive like for it from Vegas to la for instance it's like what four hours so the moon is smaller than the drive from Vegas to la
[126:10.82]You got one guide?
[126:11.62]You got one guide big time.
[126:12.92]Did I?
[126:14.30]No.
[126:14.98]Huge one guy.
[126:15.77]Yeah.
[126:16.79]What is it?
[126:17.67]How many miles is it?
[126:22.35]It takes 166 days.
[126:23.97]It's 60 miles per hour.
[126:25.09]I was going to say that doesn't sound... I was going to say, okay.
[126:31.54]Oh my God.
[126:32.24]What an idiot I am.
[126:35.33]The state of Rhode Island would not show up in space.
[126:39.65]I don't know.
[126:40.17]So why would I think that like driving to fucking California would show up that distance?
[126:50.69]You just, I've, you've, I've never asked or answered that question of scale.
[126:54.07]I'm just like, oh yeah, it's huge.
[126:55.97]But how, how long does it take to drive?
[127:01.69]Mercury, Titan, Mars.
[127:07.82]Venus.
[127:08.53]Earth.
[127:09.01]How long do you think it would take you to drive from there to there?
[127:13.97]Kepler.
[127:15.83]22B.
[127:16.73]Earth-like exoplanet.
[127:22.92]Yeah, that does kind of look like the PlayStation 1 version of Earth.
[127:27.56]That's weird.
[127:30.56]Neptune.
[127:35.41]Uranus.
[127:39.99]I guess Saturn is this big, isn't it?
[127:42.01]Jupiter.
[127:42.53]Jupiter is not really even that much bigger than Saturn.
[127:55.57]There are so many other suns out there.
[127:57.67]Our sun, it's like a little wuss in comparison.
[128:10.81]Aldebaran red giant star.
[128:17.35]Oh my God.
[128:20.72]Beetlejuice.
[128:26.50]So how, what would this look like on the horizon?
[128:29.58]If it was in kind of at least far, far, far enough away, we could see it, but far enough away where it's not going to kill us.
[128:36.62]If it likes, you know, gets too close.
[128:39.84]It would take up the whole sky.
[128:40.62]It would take up the entire sky.
[128:42.30]That's so terrifying.
[128:49.07]The idea of another planet or another star being that close, it's so horrifying.
[128:58.94]This is cool.
[129:08.91]I'd spend Bill Gates's money.
[129:12.53]Big Mac.
[129:12.97]How many Big Macs can I get?
[129:14.19]I love how you can sell them, too.
[129:23.52]Flip-flops, Coca-Cola.
[129:27.84]There was more?
[129:29.44]Oh, fuck.
[129:29.88]There was more.
[129:30.46]Was there?
[129:31.08]I thought I pressed right on the D-pad.
[129:39.04]There's much more.
[129:40.02]Wait, that wasn't the biggest thing ever?
[129:41.34]That's too big.
[130:05.67]I wouldn't know we're doing like nebulas.
[130:07.21]I thought I'm talking about like, of course, like a galaxy and nebulas bigger.
[130:10.94]I'm talking about individual.
[130:13.56]And it's individual stars.
[130:22.41]The hell is going on here?
[130:26.03]How do we even operate?
[130:27.27]What even is all this?
[130:33.44]Are we just in a petri dish somewhere?
[130:36.79]In somebody's laboratory or something?
[130:38.45]Like, look at this.
[130:47.63]Because, man, this is kind of what it looks like when you do an experiment in middle school.
[130:53.12]It's like, oh, look, bacteria growing.
[130:55.18]It looks like this.
[131:04.81]We're getting too big.
[131:13.23]Dude, what if all of our collective energy and all of our collective thoughts and all of our collective kind of electromagnetic pulses that we're all making, what if we are the universe?
[131:28.42]It's us.
[131:30.80]The universe is one.
[131:31.52]We are the universe.
[131:42.71]Andromeda.
[131:49.00]Local group.
[131:51.20]Galaxy group.
[131:54.36]The Virgo supercluster.
[131:55.72]There's so many things.
[132:01.45]Oh, my God.
[132:02.23]The huge LQG.
[132:11.52]So wait, this is the size of the observable universe.
[132:21.20]Getting all the answers is enticing.
[132:26.54]I don't, I don't know.
[132:34.91]It's 83 million light years in diameter.
[132:39.81]Yeah.
[132:39.95]When are we going to hit the sky box?
[132:42.62]Right?
[132:43.22]It's going to have to happen eventually.
[132:49.49]One of these days, some NASA scientist, 5,000 years in the future, is going to be visibly annoyed because he can't clip any further.
[132:58.41]He can't go any further.
[132:59.37]And he's like, what the fuck?
[133:01.31]What the fuck, man?
[133:03.61]Oh, there's an invisible wall.
[133:05.79]There's going to be invisible walls that you can't cross.
[133:11.76]It's like when a dev puts some kind of like a bush and then an entire wall behind it.
[133:17.73]So it's like you can't ever cross it.
[133:18.93]It's like, oh, here's a line of bushes.
[133:21.53]You can't ever go further than that.
[133:24.49]The unplayable area.
[133:26.07]What the hell even is out here though?
[133:28.34]I know there's a lot of questions of like, where did we come from?
[133:31.38]Who are we?
[133:32.40]Why are we here?
[133:35.78]What the hell is all this other shit that's out here?
[133:42.78]What are we?
[133:52.99]The amount of things that we know versus the amount of things that we do not know is ridiculous.
[134:03.57]Video games.
[134:04.15]We can buy all the video games.
[134:13.66]a year of Netflix what is a million years of Netflix oh I don't have any money how many Netflix wait wait I just bought Netflix subscriptions for like 10 times the people on Earth
[134:41.94]One, how many digits?
[134:42.88]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[134:48.12]Alright, sell it all.
[134:56.89]I can't.
[134:58.99]I can only sell it individually now.
[135:02.17]Oh shit, I only have $3,500 left.
[135:09.10]I gotta be smart with this then.
[135:14.34]Shit, I'm broke.
[135:24.45]You could buy a bunch of McDonald's franchises.
[135:33.94]How did I get all my money gone before I even got to a mansion?
[135:49.03]Oh, okay.
[135:50.15]So 35 Big Macs is really not that many over the course of a year.
[135:54.53]Five flip-flops?
[135:55.47]I probably go through five pairs of flip-flops.
[135:58.37]I go through a pair of flip-flops a year.
[136:01.03]At least.
[136:04.27]Maybe every two years.
[136:06.70]21 packs of Coca-Cola.
[136:08.40]Got to go to the movies 25 times.
[136:11.14]But... I got to...
[136:17.44]Watch, uh, every Adam Sandler movie that went on Netflix across every television on Earth.
[136:36.01]Who was alive?
[136:37.63]Who was alive in 18 1800.
[136:38.33]Let's do who's alive in one.
[136:48.53]saint Peter Jesus was five years old in year one can we do like zero four years old can I do like negative zero like negative a hundred
[137:21.30]Negative zero.
[137:21.94]Are you dumb?
[137:23.26]Yes.
[137:25.54]How about, like, 1,700?
[137:30.83]Can you imagine if I could, like, this is an era where I think I would have fit in very well.
[137:46.68]Like, back in, like, the area where you could wear, like, these, like, goofy fucking headpieces.
[137:54.05]Like, if this was still here, if this fashion was still here, I think I would be doing this.
[138:07.14]Oh, absolutely.
[138:09.12]Oh, 100%.
[138:09.80]Absolutely.
[138:11.56]I mean, like, I kind of look like this right now.
[138:14.48]Just make this white.
[138:17.86]Give me white hair.
[138:21.80]And just put a bunch of curlers in it.
[138:29.79]Okay, ready?
[138:30.95]Make this hair white and... Right?
[138:47.66]I feel like this is a really cool tool.
[138:50.11]Okay, what about year 10?
[139:01.03]Year... 50.
[139:05.77]Titus.
[139:10.01]Oh.
[139:11.73]Pliny the Elder.
[139:13.33]Josephus.
[139:14.61]Plutarch.
[139:16.19]Nero.
[139:18.00]Timothy.
[139:27.88]Cool.
[139:32.03]We are at $17,500 for 60.
[139:39.63]Getting close to that $20,000.
[139:45.26]Getting close to $20,000 for Habitat for Humanity.
[139:56.25]What's this?
[139:56.63]Universe forecast.
[139:58.59]What is the future?
[139:59.23]We were just talking about this, so I kind of want to know.
[140:02.60]What is the future of the universe?
[140:05.86]Well, using some science, we can make a few predictions.
[140:08.29]In 2061, Halley's Comet will return again.
[140:11.27]Okay.
[140:18.88]Is that bad?
[140:19.72]In 2178, Pluto will complete its first orbit since discovery.
[140:28.41]In 2300, after traveling billions of kilometers, Voyager 1 will finally reach the Oort cloud.
[140:38.21]Is this where the aliens get to hear all of the music and TV shows from the 60s or whatever it is?
[140:52.15]50,000 years from now, the star VY Canis Majoris will explode in a supernova.
[141:00.02]Explosion will outshine the rest of the Milky Way.
[141:05.54]A new Hawaiian island will surface in 75,000 years.
[141:13.61]Really?
[141:16.39]Many of today's constellations will be unrecognizable in 100,000 years.
[141:21.27]Oh, that's kind of sad.
[141:26.13]No, no, that's actually sad.
[141:27.81]I don't like that.
[141:32.42]Two of Uranus's moons will collide.
[141:43.66]There's like a butt cheek joke here about like, oh yeah, when your butt cheeks fucking slap together, you're fucking, it's going to be like when Uranus's moons collide.
[142:03.35]Just wait 999 million years.
[142:10.61]999,999 years.
[142:12.21]People are going to be making like, like stupid jokes about this.
[142:20.96]Like that will be on Twitter when there's like 10,000 years left, like a thousand years left.
[142:25.92]People will be making those jokes on Twitter.
[142:35.53]Twitter is... No.
[142:39.27]Guys, the only thing that's going to be around in a million years are going to be the bugs.
[142:42.73]Okay?
[142:43.63]The bugs.
[142:44.17]They're going to rule everything.
[142:45.93]They're going to be living in houses, probably.
[142:51.77]They'll probably be going to work and stuff.
[142:57.23]As Mars gains a ring in a hundred million years, Saturn will slowly lose them.
[143:03.14]And oddly, Saturn will spend most of its life without rings.
[143:07.54]Huh.
[143:12.04]The moon continues gradually slowing down the Earth in 180 million years.
[143:16.95]Days become 25 hours long.
[143:18.75]Hopefully work hours don't also increase.
[143:21.65]That is weird.
[143:25.79]In a world hundreds of millions of years in the future, time is going to slow down.
[143:33.97]We just got a raid.
[143:38.07]From AndersonJPH.
[143:40.79]What's up?
[143:42.43]Welcome, Raiders.
[143:44.36]We are currently doing a Neil.fun.
[143:48.96]That is N as in Nancy, E as in eel, A as in apple, L as in life force, F as in fun.
[144:02.78]Hold on, neal.fun.
[144:04.72]N-E-A-L.F as in fun, U as in Uranus, N as in Nancy.
[144:15.13]Yeah, welcome to the stream.
[144:16.41]We're also raising money for the Habitat for Humanity of Greater Los Angeles for relief efforts for the LA fires.
[144:25.77]We're currently at just under $20,000 total.
[144:32.01]which is incredible.
[144:33.03]So that's fucking awesome.
[144:37.02]And I think we're going to go through it.
[144:38.02]Alright.
[144:40.10]So since the moon is further away, total solar eclipses will no longer be possible.
[144:49.74]Don't forget your glasses.
[144:50.98]This one you don't want to miss.
[144:53.19]In 800 million years.
[144:55.87]As the sun becomes brighter, photosynthesis is no longer possible on Earth.
[145:01.07]Without plant life, all animals go extinct.
[145:05.73]Oh no.
[145:07.41]And single cell organisms dominate the Earth once again.
[145:11.65]The bugs.
[145:16.95]In 1.1 billion years, the sun will be 10% brighter.
[145:20.17]The average temperature on Earth will be 116 degrees Fahrenheit.
[145:26.36]The oceans will evaporate.
[145:31.94]But on the bright side, Mars will enter the habitable zone and could provide a new home.
[145:40.02]In 5 billion... Somebody said this is ignoring evolution?
[145:46.00]Yeah, in 100 million years, I don't know, we might have... I don't know.
[145:51.97]Maybe we get like webbed hands and like webbed feet and stuff.
[145:56.59]Who knows what the hell is going to happen?
[145:57.87]All your fingernails are probably going to be gone.
[146:03.70]Uh, the Andromeda galaxy will collide with the Milky Way in five billion years.
[146:11.82]And our new home galaxy will be called Milkdromeda.
[146:15.84]We will gain a trillion neighboring stars.
[146:17.68]Anyone left will see an incredible night sky.
[146:20.83]Damn.
[146:24.85]That might be bright.
[146:31.68]In 7 billion years, as the sun becomes a red giant, it grows to 256 times its current size.
[146:39.71]Oh, wow.
[146:40.49]The sun is going to eat the Earth.
[146:47.29]The sun eats the Earth in like 10 billion years from now.
[146:53.28]Hey, the sun also eats Mercury and Venus.
[146:55.84]So don't worry.
[146:59.24]After the sun's rampaging, it cools down and becomes a white dwarf star.
[147:03.02]Any remaining life will need to get a lot closer to stay warm.
[147:08.03]In 450 billion years, the 50 plus galaxies in the Local Group are going to merge.
[147:14.77]The group is back together in a trillion years.
[147:20.73]Radiation left over from the Big Bang becomes undetectable, making it hard for future civilizations to learn about the universe.
[147:29.81]Inten... You know what's weird?
[147:33.96]Like, we've been around for a little while, and the Earth's been around for a very long time.
[147:39.64]How many events happened in the galaxy that we just don't, we just will never know?
[147:48.79]Like, what if something unbelievably crazy happened, and there's just no traces of it, and it's why we exist?
[147:57.83]Damn.
[147:58.15]Damn.
[148:00.82]damn damn yeah damn in 10 trillion years red dwarf stars turn into the first ever blue dwarf stars in a hundred trillion years the gas clouds need to make stars are depleted somewhere in the universe the last star is born and soon only white dwarf brown dwarf and neutron stars are left I was almost like choked
[148:32.68]Everything outside the local group is impossible to reach due to the expansion of the universe.
[148:39.81]Even the speed of light won't be fast enough to reach distant galaxies.
[148:43.61]My throat's getting a little dry.
[148:44.57]In 10 to the 17th power years...
[148:58.78]White dwarf stars cool to black dwarf stars, the universe is dark.
[149:02.25]The only natural light comes from the occasional supernova.
[149:06.13]In 10 to the third power, black holes are the only thing remaining, and they are massive.
[149:11.89]But even they slowly evaporate from Hawking radiation.
[149:16.71]In the last few seconds of a black hole's life, it will emit a burst of light, providing the last light in the universe.
[149:24.98]Like a final firework show, but each firework billions of years apart.
[149:30.40]After that, the universe is basically dead with nothing of interest happening.
[149:33.84]But don't worry, there's plenty of time left.
[149:38.02]January 1st.
[149:39.36]If the life of the universe was a year, you're living in the first millisecond of January 1st.
[149:46.79]So enjoy the ride.
[149:56.19]Yeah, it's a... I was just going to click that.
[150:03.58]I'm not even kidding.
[150:04.28]I was going to click this.
[150:09.75]It's like, oh, IQ test.
[150:17.21]I need to pee.
[150:18.97]I'll come back and we'll do maybe one or two more things.
[150:25.55]We'll do the other few that we haven't seen.
[150:33.70]Me too, dude.
[150:34.52]Yeah.
[150:37.40]Yeah, go go take a break.
[150:41.21]I'll see you guys very soon.
[150:42.75]I'm going to run ads during the break.
[150:47.00]So there'll be probably a few minutes of ads when the BRB screen appears.
[154:46.04]Okay.
[154:46.32]I'm back.
[154:47.56]How are you doing?
[154:50.20]So pre-roll should be off for an hour.
[154:52.03]I did only start doing this experiment the last couple of streams, but for those that aren't aware, uh, I'm going to be trying to run ads during BRBs and periods where there's just nothing happening.
[155:06.56]There's no content on the screen.
[155:09.40]Because we're experimenting with removing pre-rolls.
[155:14.58]And having a healthy kind of relationship with, I guess, ads on the channel.
[155:23.83]This is so much better than ads interrupting.
[155:30.41]Yeah, I mean, if that's the general consensus, I feel like people really don't like pre-rolls.
[155:35.22]They really don't like them.
[155:36.72]So...
[155:43.35]Yeah, a lot of people have ad block people have, you know, different depending on where you are in different countries.
[155:49.86]And yeah, I mean, it's you probably won't get them sometimes.
[155:55.06]I don't know.
[155:55.52]I have no idea how it works, really.
[155:56.66]Yeah, let's go.
[156:01.40]That should probably take us to the end of the stream.
[156:02.86]So imagine probably taking another 40 minutes to an hour to do the rest of these.
[156:09.23]Maybe we'll see.
[156:14.70]Alright.
[156:15.38]What else do I want to do?
[156:23.02]What is this one?
[156:23.50]This one's cool.
[156:29.91]Oh, you can't see.
[156:30.45]Hold on.
[156:34.03]Now you can see.
[156:34.83]Alright.
[156:35.07]Where are we at?
[156:36.55]We are at $18,356.
[156:43.67]almost encroaching onto the into the twenty thousand dollar mark getting there uh sell sell sell what's this one capitalism ranked ramped up in the 21st century and if you're not selling you're losing here are some products that won capitalism
[157:12.57]Toyota is king of the automobile world with 11 million cars sold a year.
[157:22.21]That's crazy.
[157:24.65]Minecraft first released in 2009.
[157:26.37]Minecraft is still one of the best-selling video games at 45 million copies sold a minute.
[157:34.34]What?
[157:34.60]That's not accurate.
[157:42.07]Wouldn't that mean there's like a hundred billion copies of Minecraft?
[157:52.06]Oh, it's okay.
[157:52.64]It's okay.
[157:53.18]I saw 45 MI.
[157:53.58]I read this.
[157:53.82]And as I read the MI, I turned my head this way.
[158:11.18]Over here to look at the chat and said million.
[158:14.52]45 million copies.
[158:21.83]Samsung sells over 40 million TVs a year.
[158:30.09]That's a lot.
[158:32.07]Hey, remember when everyone was making fun of AirPods?
[158:34.13]Whoops.
[158:35.83]They sell 114 AirPods a minute.
[158:44.39]Hey, does capitalism give you a headache?
[158:46.25]Buy some Advil.
[158:52.83]That's interesting because Advil, a lot of the painkillers, what the non-steroid anti-inflammatories, they last a long time.
[159:06.74]One bottle of this could last months and months and months and months.
[159:13.87]Surprised that it's that much.
[159:15.51]I guess, yeah, there's a lot of people.
[159:18.15]Two a second.
[159:19.05]But that's a lot, though.
[159:20.08]Two a second?
[159:24.06]Cheerios is the most popular cereal with over 100 million boxes sold a year.
[159:28.44]That, yeah.
[159:30.30]I can see that.
[159:31.92]It's great.
[159:33.42]Tastes good.
[159:35.44]Good for your heart.
[159:37.00]Good for your cholesterol.
[159:40.24]Dude, I dropped my cholesterol a lot.
[159:43.81]I had blood work done, and I had actually pretty high cholesterol.
[159:47.85]It was bad.
[159:50.27]I dropped my cholesterol by, I think it was like 20 or 30 points since the last time I took it.
[160:00.20]I think even more than that.
[160:00.90]It might have been like 40 points.
[160:08.44]Campbell's, yeah, that's six Campbell's chicken noodle soups sold a second.
[160:18.35]Yeah, and it was all thanks to Cheerios.
[160:21.59]Well, no, it was, well, I did eat Cheerios.
[160:26.87]I had a lot of oats.
[160:28.89]I was putting oats in my smoothies.
[160:31.33]I was, I cut out fried food completely.
[160:34.41]Honestly, you know, what really changed everything is I ended, I mean, it's kind of a little depressing, but I haven't had a breaded fried thing since probably
[160:49.43]I want to say somewhere around like August of last year.
[160:55.75]I probably haven't had breaded fried food in probably at least four or five months.
[161:04.96]I still eat, you know, I'll still eat a cheeseburger.
[161:06.76]I'll still eat, um, like technically fried things, but I'm talking about like breaded fried chicken, breaded mozzarella sticks, breaded, fried, deep fried.
[161:19.86]And I'm okay.
[161:21.27]I don't miss it anymore.
[161:23.31]The first month or two, when I really was trying to lower my cholesterol, I did miss it a lot.
[161:28.81]Here's Apple printing money again.
[161:30.25]Yeah.
[161:36.14]400 million shoes a year.
[161:37.48]14 pairs sold a second.
[161:46.19]I don't understand this one.
[161:47.93]And I know I'm probably going to get some flack for this, but... Dominoes?
[161:52.45]Dominoes?
[161:54.60]I guess it's just convenience?
[161:59.90]There's just a lot of them, I would imagine.
[162:01.85]There's just a shitload of them.
[162:07.28]I've never met anybody that chose Domino's.
[162:10.72]And I'm not trying to be a dick.
[162:12.18]I'm really not trying to be.
[162:14.15]I'm just saying, anytime I've ever had pizza, and I've had pizza hundreds of times, over the last probably 25 times that pizza has been ordered, either solo or with a group, this has never been brought up.
[162:30.61]This chain has never been brought up.
[162:34.30]Other ones have, you know, Pizza Hut.
[162:37.54]Yep.
[162:38.40]Had that.
[162:39.80]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[162:40.20]Let's get Pizza Hut.
[162:40.76]Dude, stuff crust.
[162:41.46]Let's go.
[162:42.98]I've heard that.
[162:43.48]Puppagino's was another one.
[162:45.46]That's mainly New England, though.
[162:47.05]That's a Northeast thing.
[162:49.07]But Never Dom.
[162:49.83]No one ever.
[162:51.05]They sell so much, but nobody I ever.
[162:54.03]I've never ordered it.
[162:55.11]It lasts like 20 years.
[163:02.35]Pizza Hut is the worst.
[163:05.32]Dominoes are everywhere.
[163:06.50]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[163:07.20]It just dominates from just the store space.
[163:12.43]Oh, here is Big Macs.
[163:14.19]Oh, my God.
[163:19.83]Oh, well, anyways, those are some of the products that have won capitalism.
[163:23.23]Congratulations to the winner.
[163:24.39]Wait, what's that?
[163:25.32]Oh, no.

[168:05.54]Alright, so you have... How do you play Wordle?
[168:20.23]You have to guess the word and you can get... Okay, let's do... You have to spell out a word.
[168:26.70]One, two, five.
[168:27.48]Okay, how about... I don't know, like igloo.
[168:38.41]Okay, there's an I and an L somewhere.
[168:40.09]How about live?
[168:41.05]Lives.
[168:51.25]I-L?
[168:51.77]Ill?
[168:52.58]Lee?

[168:54.66]Lee?
[168:56.02]L-E?
[168:56.38]E?
[168:56.42]Well, it's something that ends in an I-L or an L-O.
[169:26.12]Okay, so it's L.I.
[169:29.76]Something Lee.
[169:32.04]Something Lee.
[169:35.17]Something Lee.
[169:41.47]Well, actually, that might not be true.
[169:46.19]That's wrong in that, it's in the wrong position, but it's here.
[169:49.01]Wrong position, wrong position.
[169:51.07]It could be something, the L could be in the middle.
[169:53.41]No, no, no.
[169:54.01]I mean, like, I don't know.
[169:55.93]It's the first time, it's the first time I've ever played this game.
[170:07.66]Like, how about like daily?
[170:09.28]Daily?
[170:14.65]Okay.
[170:15.45]So where does this L go?
[170:16.55]The end?
[170:17.01]I-L?
[170:26.44]Day... It's not Lee.
[170:28.96]It's L. I-L.
[170:35.63]Daffodil.

[171:53.00]Great.
[172:04.62]Let's include a two letter symbol from the periodic table.
[172:09.14]Uh,
[172:16.26]Two-letter symbol.

[172:19.80]Isn't gold AU?
[172:22.96]Oh, lowercase.
[172:25.34]Your password must include the current phase of the moon as an emoji.
[172:31.58]I can't do that.
[172:35.92]What's the... Oh, it's a full moon.
[172:37.28]Full moon.
[172:37.78]We learned that already.
[172:39.06]How do you do a full moon on like Windows 10?
[172:41.60]I guess I do full moon emoji and just look it up and find it.
[172:51.14]Full moon emoji.
[172:52.08]I think that's it right there, right?
[173:05.20]It's no, it's waning.
[173:06.14]It's waning.
[173:13.85]Uh, this should be it, right?
[173:17.45]No.
[173:18.83]Is it, it's not a full moon?
[173:23.98]It's the one right before it.
[173:31.40]I don't, I want, we are at $19,876 for Habitat for Humanity.
[173:35.14]Just barely under $20,000. $20,000.
[173:53.75]Here it comes.
[173:55.19]Here it comes.
[173:59.69]It's happening.
[174:00.27]19.
[174:06.76]Oh, there it is.
[174:08.12]Yes.
[174:08.70]Nice job.
[174:10.84]Hey.
[174:12.68]That's $20,000 to Habitat for Humanity.
[174:16.23]Greater LA.
[174:19.89]You guys absolutely crushed it.
[174:21.19]Thank you.
[174:24.73]Nice work.
[174:39.56]25, 25.
[174:40.26]Let's see.
[174:40.92]We'll see how far it goes.
[174:44.48]But I'm very happy.
[174:46.60]Thank you.
[174:48.76]I was like, oh, should I do maybe, well, maybe we can do 5,000.
[174:51.22]Can we get it?
[174:53.56]No, this is wonderful.
[174:55.34]You guys are wonderful.
[174:56.28]Thank you.
[175:00.28]Yeah, this is going to the relief efforts for the fires in Los Angeles.
[175:05.17]A lot of people that have been affected by it.
[175:07.19]I know people personally that have been very, very, very badly affected by it.
[175:10.73]So I'm glad to do it.
[175:14.28]So thank you, everybody.
[175:19.17]Okay, let's include... Oh, I need the waning moon emoji.
[175:32.52]Is this the right one?
[175:35.58]That's not the right one.
[175:40.96]What's right... No, it's... Is it waxing?
[175:44.38]Waning?
[175:45.42]Waxing?
[175:46.80]Is it...
[175:52.65]Is there a waxing?
[175:56.56]The ghastly gibbous?
[175:58.38]Waning gibbous?
[176:09.77]Yeah, that's definitely it.
[176:12.97]That is absolutely it.
[176:14.11]Perhaps it must include the name of this country.
[176:21.22]Um...
[176:44.02]I don't know.
[176:44.70]It's probably like, I don't know, the country of Florida.
[176:48.20]Yeah.
[176:48.46]Guess what?
[176:49.52]There are bumper stickers that a bunch of fucking assholes put on their car.
[176:54.45]Okay.
[176:54.67]Yeah.
[176:57.09]I'm from the country of Florida.
[177:05.23]Greece?
[177:07.71]No.
[177:11.03]Spain?
[177:13.48]Um, Florida?
[177:15.06]Uh, Italy.
[177:28.81]Croatia?
[177:35.17]Let me look at, hold on.
[177:48.32]Look at some of these buildings.
[177:49.58]Okay.
[177:53.77]I don't know.
[177:54.23]Yeah, like South America?
[177:58.73]I'm going to say... Like Brazil?
[178:07.13]No?
[178:11.32]Ecuador?
[178:13.94]Japan?
[178:16.62]Japan?
[178:21.78]Who said Siberia?
[178:23.66]It's not... What?
[178:27.06]Singapore?
[178:27.82]Oh, that's actually probably a good one.
[178:29.88]Oh.
[178:38.48]I'm just, like, thrown out.
[178:39.34]Okay.
[178:39.64]What about... What is this?
[178:50.18]Hmm.
[178:52.16]It's not, it's not New Hampshire.
[178:53.44]It has to be a country.
[179:00.15]Any flags?
[179:00.93]I can't see any flags or anything.
[179:02.17]I need to put my glasses on.
[179:03.27]I can't see anything.
[179:08.33]Palm trees.
[179:18.85]France.
[179:20.49]I did Italy.
[179:29.98]Mexico is not a bad answer.
[179:32.68]Oh.
[179:34.70]Turkey?
[179:35.12]Is it Tahiti?
[179:39.30]Tahiti?
[179:39.68]Is it?
[179:40.38]I don't know.
[179:43.48]Malta?
[179:47.32]Australia?
[179:47.88]How do you spell?
[179:51.77]How do you?
[179:52.51]That was a ton of.
[179:53.25]It's like a whistle.
[179:59.65]Uh, Olivia.
[180:10.18]Damn.
[180:11.32]Uh, I don't know.
[180:16.08]There's going to be some kind of a landmark or a flag or something here, right?
[180:35.36]What side of the road did they drive on?
[180:45.17]Okay, there's horizontal lines on the road, not vertical ones.
[180:54.48]Where is this?
[180:58.16]Oh, Morocco?
[181:02.76]How do you spell Morocco?
[181:03.56]It's not Morocco.
[181:09.84]Cuba?
[181:15.30]Monte Carlo.
[181:16.54]I don't know.
[181:17.20]I'm just writing in like random fucking places.
[181:21.50]Fiji?
[181:21.96]Estonia?
[181:32.03]Argentina is actually probably it.
[181:36.78]Damn it.
[181:41.42]Cyprus.
[181:46.67]Greenland?
[181:53.83]It's not The Bahamas.
[182:00.61]Turkey.
[182:01.09]I tried Turkey.
[182:01.71]Did I spell it wrong?
[182:02.87]No, I can.
[182:07.70]I know somebody did like 10 question marks after Greenland.
[182:10.26]I'm just writing.
[182:11.04]I'm writing things that chat are putting in.
[182:13.44]Panama.
[182:18.88]United States.
[182:26.94]Japan.
[182:29.63]Korea.
[182:31.39]Uh, South Korea.
[182:38.88]Huh?
[182:45.08]Is it India?
[182:47.02]Huh?
[182:51.90]Wait, what did you say?
[182:55.40]Indonesia?
[182:56.34]Oh, no, I lost my fucking planet!
[183:14.25]Austria.
[183:23.58]Portugal.
[183:24.08]I tried Portugal.
[183:25.06]Lebanon.
[183:25.48]I mean, is it Israel?
[183:35.34]It is.
[183:35.76]What the fuck?
[183:36.62]Okay.
[183:38.20]Your password must include the best move in algebraic chess notation.
[183:43.41]What?
[183:51.11]I don't know how to play chess.
[184:00.14]The best move in algebraic chess notation.
[184:03.44]F7 is an illegal move.
[184:05.70]Oh, no.
[184:09.46]Oh, dear.
[184:10.76]I have to get rid of the F7?
[184:14.58]Where is that from?
[184:28.02]I don't know.
[184:29.56]I might have to tap out at rule 16 here.
[184:37.81]I got to go learn chess to get a password.
[184:40.27]I don't know.
[184:41.27]I don't know about this one.
[184:43.21]I don't know.
[184:43.79]I'm going to say, because I have to get rid of F7 and F7 is part of, I don't remember.
[184:50.60]I'm going to delete it and see what happens.
[184:55.95]Must add up to 25.
[184:56.76]That's the captcha.
[185:00.00]It's in the captcha.
[185:02.70]Wait.
[185:05.60]Oh, man.
[185:06.64]Okay.
[185:13.55]I'm fucking out of here.
[185:18.29]I'm not doing this.
[185:20.67]Okay.
[185:24.04]That was cool, though.
[185:24.75]I like that a lot.
[185:25.69]That was a cool one.
[185:26.95]I could see how if you have 150 IQ, that would be a fun one to do.
[185:35.54]Wonders of Street View.
[185:40.40]So this, I guess you can submit.
[185:44.86]Why is Street View inside of somebody's office?
[185:56.43]So you can submit, I think, interesting Street View things.
[186:01.11]And they may use them.
[186:02.19]So this is funny.
[186:04.60]But why is there a Street View in an office?
[186:07.24]Office wrap prank.
[186:08.62]But why is there like a Google fucking car in here?
[186:12.22]This would have been an annoying day to be at work.
[186:25.19]Where even are we?
[186:35.70]Hot tub monkeys in Japan.
[186:38.30]Cool.
[186:46.69]You know how awesome it would be to actually be able to sit in this?
[187:04.26]I know that's monkeys.
[187:05.18]I know that's some smaller monkeys.
[187:07.00]Are these the kind of monkeys that when you go on vacation, they beat the shit out of you and take the Cheez-Its out of your backpack?
[187:15.50]Or is it different?
[187:24.14]Melting house.
[187:25.34]What the hell?
[187:29.99]Whoa.
[187:31.71]It's like sloped.
[187:38.49]There's like a, it's like a curvature on this.
[187:40.38]Is there a window down here too?
[187:45.98]What is this?
[187:46.54]This is wild looking.
[187:50.86]In England somewhere.
[187:56.22]Cool.
[187:59.01]The Breckenridge troll in Breckenridge, Colorado.
[188:08.59]Okay.
[188:08.97]I didn't, I didn't know he had a bottom half.
[188:14.20]Okay.
[188:20.92]It's funny how this is just uploaded here.
[188:22.62]That's cool.
[188:28.49]Average Disney fan.
[188:30.75]Oh my God.
[188:48.93]I feel like this is somebody did all this because they thought that it would like prevent damage.
[188:56.91]So you get like plus one defense from doing this.
[189:05.26]This little the salute in Slovenia.
[189:15.31]Oh, they're saluting the fucking Google car.
[189:23.56]Alright, that's funny.
[189:28.43]How long are they there for?
[189:31.67]Ah, man, that was awesome.
[189:32.77]Alright, yeah, let's get the fuck out of here.
[189:35.61]No, you got to hold it.
[189:36.55]You got to... Oh, no, no, you didn't commit to it.
[189:39.84]You got to hold it.
[189:40.60]You got to hold it until the car is out of view.
[189:44.18]No!
[189:45.48]Oh, too bad.
[189:47.62]You got to stay there until it's out of view.
[189:49.49]It's like a mile away.
[189:56.95]It's funny.
[189:57.43]Yeah.
[189:58.19]Where did they notice it?
[189:59.43]Is there a point?
[190:00.93]Because there's nobody over here now.
[190:04.26]I don't see anybody kind of getting ready for it.
[190:06.50]It just kind of appeared.
[190:15.94]The cyclist.
[190:18.28]Whoa.
[190:18.58]What is it?
[190:19.04]Bicycles?
[190:20.08]What is this?
[190:20.62]Oh my God.
[190:27.83]That's cool.
[190:33.67]And Santa Rosa.
[190:36.89]Colored pencil fence in, uh, somewhere in Poland.
[190:40.71]Oh, that's really cool actually.
[190:51.24]I kind of love this.
[190:57.98]Is this like a school or an art school or an art program or something?
[191:01.45]That would be awesome.
[191:05.95]Practice in Corvallis, Oregon.
[191:18.53]But who is the who is the person with the camera?
[191:23.69]Yeah.
[191:23.87]Cause it's just like, what is it?
[191:25.77]Cause very, very obviously this seems to have every single person's attention.
[191:32.74]So this thing has to be big.
[191:34.10]This is a large person, a large unit thing.
[191:38.53]Is it a, is it actually a Google car?
[191:55.43]That's funny.
[192:01.91]It's a little goo... It's not a large... It's not a large person.
[192:09.29]I thought that was a real traffic light, and I was about to say that seems like the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.
[192:17.23]But... You know, I do kind of have a... I don't know where this is, but...
[192:25.02]I think I would be confused if I actually... It looks like you do drive around this.
[192:32.37]There's an intersection here.
[192:35.97]I feel like somebody is going to look at this and go, I don't know what to do, and just fucking go... Plant truck.
[192:58.36]Yeah, I mean... Yeah.
[193:04.17]Not much else to say about that.
[193:05.43]It's a plant truck.
[193:09.47]Monster Mart.
[193:11.59]Home of the legendary Boggy Creek Monster.
[193:17.52]That's cool.
[193:18.72]What is the Boggy Creek Monster?
[193:30.32]What do you think it smells like in here?
[193:37.43]I'm going to say like wood.
[193:42.37]Yeah, like wood and tobacco.
[193:49.07]It actually probably smells pretty good in here.
[193:57.20]Probably smells like bathroom cleaner.
[194:09.70]Oh, and don't forget Jerry's General Store.
[194:14.62]Do you think, okay, do you think we have Monster Mart and Jerry's?
[194:24.31]I wonder if there's, I wonder if they, they probably talk, right?
[194:29.09]Okay, do you think that Jerry's has similar items to the Monster Mart?
[194:35.47]Monster Mart, there's one small problem with the Monster Mart.
[194:39.12]Jerry's has gas.
[194:43.92]Looks like the Monster Mart at one point had it, but I don't.
[194:47.64]Do they?
[194:48.25]No, I don't think so.
[194:49.29]Is there a drive-thru?
[195:00.56]In Fook, Arkansas.
[195:10.72]Arkansas is interesting.
[195:11.84]I feel like I would love every second of living in Arkansas until I kind of opened my eyes in bed one day and I just kind of said, I live in fucking Arkansas.
[195:28.45]Like, what am I doing here?
[195:43.04]Although to be fair, uh, if you asked me 10 years ago, I don't think the answer to that question would have been Vegas, Las Vegas.
[195:52.08]I'd be like, you're fucking out of your mind.
[195:54.48]No, this, why would I ever live in Las Vegas?
[195:56.62]What are you talking about?
[195:57.68]That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.
[196:00.74]So I don't know.
[196:01.16]Maybe I'll end up in Arkansas.
[196:11.67]Coop's shot tower.
[196:22.17]Why?
[196:22.47]What?
[196:22.87]What's going on here?
[196:24.72]Why is this a huge?
[196:27.00]What is it?
[196:27.30]Was it for?
[196:35.24]Tenure as Argentina coach is over.
[196:39.57]Is this part of it or is this like a, like a, like a big ad or a big newsfeed or something?
[196:48.33]I mean, that's really cool looking.
[196:49.57]That's really crazy looking.
[196:50.87]It's a mall.
[196:51.77]Oh yeah.
[196:52.21]Okay.
[196:54.33]I should have just panned down.
[196:55.49]I'm like, what is going on?
[196:58.23]Like, oh my God, what happened?
[197:00.17]There's this huge thing about this guy not coaching anymore.
[197:04.84]Is that, oh, it's a mall.
[197:11.71]Oh my god, a ghost.
[197:18.33]Cool.
[197:20.96]Giant shopping cart.
[197:22.54]Hey, in Sao Paulo, Brazil?
[197:28.76]Oh my god, this thing is huge.
[197:30.34]I thought it was just moderately oversized.
[197:32.29]This is bigger than cars.
[197:36.83]I didn't realize the cars and the people back there.
[197:38.71]I was just like, oh yeah, it's maybe like 20% larger.
[197:44.62]I almost want more scale.
[197:45.98]Doesn't this feel weirdly scaled?
[197:47.52]I want more stuff next to it.
[197:50.92]Like, these people could be far away.
[197:52.28]I want somebody standing right next to this.
[198:09.81]Yeah, it's still the scale doesn't work.
[198:11.89]Why is it so scaled?
[198:13.23]Whoa.
[198:17.72]What is going on with the street view?
[198:19.06]I mean, it is not, I mean, it is a large, it's a giant shopping cart.
[198:35.11]Cool.
[198:35.49]Alright, let's go.
[198:39.29]The Internet Explorer grave in, is that Gwangsangbuk-do, South Korea.
[198:49.21]Use a good tool to download other browsers.
[198:55.42]And now it's edge.
[199:02.68]Hey, Internet Explorer chugged and crawled and got really bloated and fat.
[199:14.80]So Mozilla could run.
[199:16.78]And so Chrome could run.
[199:19.26]No, I don't use Chrome either.
[199:20.54]Firefox, Mozilla, all the way.
[199:24.55]I am a Firefox browser user.
[199:30.25]And I don't know what happened five to 10 years ago, but Mozilla had like a massive share of all the, it was most people had Mozilla.
[199:39.71]Most people had Firefox.
[199:42.31]That stopped happening.
[199:43.69]Most people moved on to Chrome or even people use Edge or obviously Safari if you're on mobile.
[199:48.97]But I think Firefox is the best one.
[199:51.56]I think Firefox should get a complete resurgence.
[199:53.78]I think people should be downloading and using it.
[199:56.24]It is slick.
[199:59.12]It is quick.
[200:00.74]It's clean.
[200:01.52]I don't have any bullshit on it.
[200:03.34]It just opens.
[200:04.28]It's quick.
[200:04.72]It moves.
[200:06.95]It just works for me.
[200:13.03]Whoa, bath time.
[200:20.50]One day, I just want to pet an elephant.
[200:25.66]That's a bucket list thing.
[200:26.50]That's one day.
[200:26.94]I just want to pet an elephant's head and say, hey, look at you.
[200:36.79]Look at how big your ears are.
[200:39.91]Don't do that.
[200:41.03]Don't do that.
[200:42.89]When he puts his head up and he puts his trunk up and he's like, I think this guy has his phone.
[201:00.89]He's like, holy shit, I got to get a video of this.
[201:13.49]Oh, this is Israel.
[201:16.59]What the hell even are all these?
[201:21.34]Is it bread?
[201:30.06]Is this a Google Street glitch?
[201:32.14]Yeah, I don't think this is actually an extra lie.
[201:34.62]I mean, I thought it was for a second.
[201:37.70]Wait, well, hold on.
[201:38.22]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[201:50.76]Oh man, it really wasn't real.
[201:52.46]Oh my god.
[202:04.08]Florida, there we go.
[202:15.37]This feels like...
[202:18.15]How deep is this water?
[202:20.35]Okay, I think he's just going off into... It almost looks like he's like, hey, hey, take a look at that gator over there.
[202:27.70]I'll show you what I'm... Hey, watch this.
[202:30.48]To me, this is like a watch this, and I don't know if I want to watch this.
[202:34.23]I think I'm out of here.
[202:44.09]No, no, no.
[202:44.89]Of course gators love when you sing to them.
[202:47.27]Really close to their face.
[202:50.03]Alright.
[202:50.71]It's nice to see everybody.
[202:54.27]I've got a lot of shit to do tomorrow, so I've got to go.
[202:56.03]I've got to get up early tomorrow.
[203:05.26]Steel house.
[203:12.01]Where's Otto?
[203:13.49]I'll show you Otto, don't worry.
[203:15.11]Stream's not over yet.
[203:18.99]That's very bizarre.
[203:35.35]What is going on here?
[203:37.99]This is the coolest and also one of the most unsanitary things that they could have seen.
[203:45.93]I would actually think this was cool to do.
[203:47.49]I would want to do this if there was like a van parked right here.
[203:55.33]And in that van was a mobile shower.
[203:58.51]And all of my clothes were thrown into the trash.
[204:02.55]Into wherever the nearest trash can is.
[204:14.41]That's wild.
[204:23.98]Just like holding what, like corn in your hands?
[204:26.04]This is a frenzy.
[204:32.21]Pigeons aren't that dirty.
[204:33.65]No, they're not.
[204:34.81]Pigeons are wonderful.
[204:36.05]Pigeons are doves.
[204:37.65]Pigeons are a dove.
[204:39.85]And we just, like, don't give a shit anymore.
[204:43.07]Doves are wonderful.
[204:44.55]Pigeons are wonderful rock doves.
[204:48.00]Get that through your head.
[204:52.00]Umbrella field.
[205:00.02]Damn.
[205:02.77]Wow.
[205:06.74]This thing about Europe.
[205:08.58]Like, you could just walk a couple miles in Europe, stop, face a direction, and have a screenshot from Elden Ring.
[205:18.77]It's crazy.
[205:19.45]Alright, I'm kind of addicted to this, but I'm going to move on.
[205:32.10]Come to Edinburgh.
[205:32.82]We have a castle.
[205:35.60]Oh, yeah.
[205:36.00]No, that's awesome.
[205:37.04]I'm going to make a big bucket list one day.
[205:40.83]I want to pet an elephant.
[205:42.45]I want to go to the pigeon place.
[205:47.51]I want to... Oh, this is weird.
[205:51.40]Mannequin party?
[205:52.24]I thought these were people.
[206:02.89]Oh, to be, to be, to be here on Halloween, you know, you just stand in here.
[206:11.07]Oh my God, which one of them's real?
[206:14.05]Look out!
[206:17.95]Shark attack.
[206:25.40]Interesting, uh, exterior design.
[206:32.33]Dude, wait, I'm in this photo.
[206:33.79]Are you serious?
[206:34.37]Dude, what?
[206:41.27]That's so cool.
[206:42.63]You in Oxford.
[206:44.59]So you, you ride your bike down here every day.
[206:48.33]Wow.
[206:49.03]That's so cool.
[206:51.38]What's the food like here?
[206:52.26]Is it good?
[206:52.64]Yeah.
[206:59.00]I just want to like, what's the food like?
[207:00.26]Yeah, this is, this is you.
[207:09.27]Well, I lost you.
[207:09.89]It's alright.
[207:10.27]Alright.
[207:10.51]One more.
[207:12.47]The Red Boat.
[207:13.95]Norway.
[207:15.69]Svalbard, Norway.
[207:26.16]Starbase.
[207:31.77]So weird.
[207:33.99]Alright.
[207:34.41]One more.
[207:39.93]Is this a wheelie, or is this... Did this person take the turn too sharply?
[207:46.46]Oh, no.
[207:52.10]He's like, ah, I'm done.
[207:55.04]Okay, I had enough.
[207:59.12]Do it again.
[207:59.60]Come on.
[208:00.02]Come on.
[208:00.49]Pop it again.
[208:01.09]Do it again.
[208:03.53]Come on.
[208:16.28]No, we're still here.
[208:19.12]Wait, what?
[208:27.60]He just did that to do the trick in front of the... What is going on in the Netherlands?
[208:37.47]What are the traffic laws?
[208:42.53]Can somebody help me with what the traffic law at this stop is?
[208:46.85]Did he just, he go, he went like this and then he went around the photos I think are out of order.
[209:01.26]Oh, okay.
[209:05.94]No.
[209:06.04]Where'd he go?
[209:12.00]No.
[209:12.06]I wanted to follow him for a while.
[209:14.92]Shit.
[209:19.71]OK, actually, last one.
[209:23.24]The 8080.
[209:26.96]Cool.
[209:34.92]You're just why you're doom scrolling street view.
[209:41.20]If I was doom scrolling, I'd probably go.
[209:45.72]So fucking stupid.
[209:48.79]Oh my god.
[209:50.52]Okay, keep going.
[209:55.06]Oh my fucking god.
[209:58.20]Please.
[210:00.68]What?
[210:02.50]Awful.
[210:03.36]No, I'm sitting here going, cute, cool, whoa, radical, awesome.
[210:10.13]No, I'm not doom scrolling.
[210:11.59]I am
[210:17.69]Good.
[210:18.55]I am good scrolling.
[210:37.10]I feel like I want to just... This is so bright, but I feel like I want to just stand in the middle of this.
[210:46.41]Let's just sit right there for a while.
[210:52.91]Okay, if you brought a steak in here and just held it in the air for five minutes, would it be seasoned?
[211:15.18]This kind of looks like...
[211:18.82]There's a lot of, like, you know how many, like, Elsa cakes are made like this I've seen a million times?
[211:26.48]What the hell is this?
[211:27.10]I don't know.
[211:32.70]Mississippi.
[211:37.51]Well, that is weird.
[211:38.85]Oh, boy.
[211:39.75]This is very strange.
[211:48.05]It's just kind of nothing.
[211:49.83]And then that, and then nothing.
[211:58.70]Jeez.
[211:59.18]Okay.
[211:59.46]Well, what the fuck?
[212:02.63]Cheese cave.
[212:05.51]Ooh, is it?
[212:06.05]Yeah, Switzerland.
[212:16.17]I feel like it stinks in here and not in a good way, like in a really bad way that I really would kind of be off putting to me.
[212:27.68]Alright.
[212:28.82]1, 2, 3, 4.
[212:29.40]There you go.
[212:34.02]That's where we're going to end it.
[212:37.08]Uh, the swole bus in frog.
[212:44.92]Cool.
[212:48.31]Alright.
[212:49.65]I think I'm going to call it for today.
[212:51.45]There's other things I didn't do, but I wanted to hang out for a little bit.
[212:56.45]Wanted to chill for like three or four hours.
[212:59.92]I'm not done, done, done.
[213:03.88]I'm like 15 to 20 minute wind down done.
[213:09.88]Yeah, if you're going to be taking off, thanks for coming to the stream.
[213:12.66]Thanks for hanging out.
[213:13.28]Next time you'll see me will probably be on...
[213:16.55]Maybe like next week at some point.
[213:19.15]Maybe mid to late next week.
[213:26.58]Talk about the channel points thing.
[213:29.62]Yeah, there's going to be hopefully soon.
[213:34.37]If I get approval to be able to do it, that's really all it comes down to.
[213:41.39]It's kind of a weird thing.
[213:45.70]So it's kind of a different way to spend channel points.
[213:52.10]And I don't want to tell you what it is.
[213:54.30]Because I don't want to tell you and it just not happen and me go, oh yeah, I remember that thing I said that sounded kind of cool.
[213:59.16]Nah, I'll just wait.
[214:01.24]Until I can be like, hey, this is going to be cool.
[214:03.20]Nancy Drew within a week.
[214:04.26]That's right.
[214:07.42]What about Infinity Nikki?
[214:10.12]Alright, next stream we're going to do
[214:14.58]Finish, we'll probably finish Nancy Drew.
[214:19.06]And do some Infinity Nikki fit checks.
[214:26.61]How's that sound?
[214:36.41]You should play Seaman 2.
[214:37.63]Isn't that only come out in Japan or something?
[214:45.66]Yeah, I'm going to take a BRB.
[214:47.30]I'm not going to go BRB, really.
[214:49.36]I'm just going to go kind of see what auto's up to.
[214:52.38]I'm not going to run any ads or anything.
[214:53.38]I'm just going to go grab auto.
[214:56.12]I'll be right back.
[214:56.76]But yeah, if you were sticking around, if you were here for the whole day, well, three and a half hours isn't a whole day, but you've been here this afternoon, thanks for being a part of this charity, this kind of site-wide event.
[215:10.46]I know Evolved had a bunch of other creators and streamers and stuff doing it too.
[215:15.71]So what's the collective, how much is, um, how much has it been collectively?
[215:19.45]Let's see.
[215:22.74]Oops, wrong thing.
[215:26.42]Collectively the whole campaign so far is wow.
[215:36.79]Holy shit.
[215:37.23]Okay.
[215:38.31]Almost $60,000.
[215:42.62]has been raised so far.
[215:44.98]Currently a $75,000 goal.
[215:49.53]So that's fucking awesome.
[215:54.01]Let me see.
[215:54.41]Alright, I'm going to go BRB.
[215:55.21]I'll be right back.
[215:56.83]Thank you for hanging out.
[215:57.67]Thanks.
[215:58.95]A bunch of donations just came in.
[216:01.07]We were at like 21 or 20.
[216:02.41]Now we're at 22.
[216:03.39]You guys are awesome.
[216:06.75]Awesome.
[216:07.21]Huge fucking donations just came in.
[216:09.41]1200 bucks just came in.
[216:11.41]I saw a couple other 1,000, 2,000, 1,000, 1,000.
[216:12.54]You guys crushed it.
[216:16.02]Thanks for doing that.
[216:18.12]I'll see you guys real soon.
[216:19.72]And again, that was for Habitat for Humanity to benefit the relief efforts for the LA wildfires.
[216:33.35]I'll be right back.
[218:45.22]Okay, he's here.
[218:48.58]Come sit right here.
[218:49.10]Right over here.
[218:52.04]I'm so glad he's doing better, too.
[218:54.87]So to give a little bit of TL;DR, back in the kind of middle of the summer, I can't even remember the condition because it's idiopathic
[219:09.83]rhinitis, it's something.
[219:12.61]It's like a constant rhinitis.
[219:15.37]And I was told that there's not a whole lot they can really do.
[219:18.44]You just kind of have to deal with it.
[219:20.82]It was really bad.
[219:21.78]It was very, very bad.
[219:24.30]I think I told some of you guys this.
[219:27.84]I know I told some of the mods this too, that I was kind of scared.
[219:32.73]I was really scared about how he was doing and if he was going to be okay.
[219:37.79]But thank
[219:39.37]Thankfully, he's doing much better.
[219:41.73]He still has the nose problem.
[219:44.66]It just got like 78% better.
[219:50.72]So he's doing okay.
[219:52.02]He still sneezes a lot, but not even close to where it was, and he's very comfortable.
[219:55.84]Otto, show them all that you're doing okay.
[219:58.93]I don't know if you can even... He's going to start going like...
[220:11.40]Let's see.
[220:11.68]Can you see?
[220:12.83]Come here.
[220:13.57]Right here.
[220:14.15]Oh, let me move this out of the way so I can put him over here.
[221:12.78]Okay.
[221:13.00]Let's see.
[221:13.36]Let's see if you can see him.
[221:15.26]You're not going to be able to hear me, but I'll show him for like 30 seconds.
[221:17.77]Okay.
[221:28.65]Hold on.
[221:29.13]I need my, I need my keyboard.
[221:35.34]Oh, don't break my glasses.
[221:39.86]Oh, it's going to drop.
[221:40.92]Nope.
[221:41.18]I'm good.
[221:43.56]Here we go.
[221:45.40]He's sitting right here.
[221:48.60]You can see my bald spot.
[221:53.80]Huh?
[221:59.38]Who's that?
[222:07.31]Hello.
[222:10.27]Look over there.
[222:10.85]Can you look over there?
[222:16.28]My camera won't go any further.
[222:21.94]What is it?
[222:23.78]What is it?
[222:35.03]He's like, what are you doing?
[222:37.89]Do you want?
[222:38.65]He's like, yes, I want.
[222:42.10]Oh, don't press any buttons.
[222:43.06]Hold on.
[222:44.14]He was just like sat on the keyboard.
[222:49.61]Come sit right here.
[222:51.35]I have pants on.
[222:52.01]Okay.
[222:55.67]He's doing okay.
[222:59.87]I'm trying to get him so you can... My camp can't go any further.
[223:03.61]Let him stream instead.
[223:08.67]Alright.
[223:09.09]This is going to get him to get up.
[223:09.99]Ready?
[223:12.25]Okay.
[223:13.47]Okay.
[223:13.79]Let's go.
[223:14.99]Okay.
[223:15.27]Let's go.
[223:16.60]Okay.
[223:17.72]Alright.
[223:17.92]Let's go.
[223:20.71]Okay, let's go.
[223:22.65]Okay.
[223:27.89]He's like, where are we going?
[223:28.75]You just, why are you saying that?
[223:33.83]Alright.
[223:34.21]I'll see you guys later.
[223:36.61]Now he's like, you told me we were going somewhere.
[223:39.62]What?
[223:40.62]Why are you not immediately running with me?
[223:46.62]Yeah.
[223:46.84]Thanks a lot, everybody.
[223:47.68]That's a massive amount of money donated.
[223:52.03]Really appreciate it.
[223:55.13]I know.
[223:55.43]Yes, I know.
[223:56.69]A bunch of the other creators in Evolved are doing it.
[224:01.35]Thanks a lot, everybody.
[224:02.29]See you soon.
[224:02.86]Take care of yourselves.
[224:03.82]$22,000.
[224:03.88]Appreciate it, everybody.
[224:10.48]Thank you.
[224:13.58]Have a great evening.
[224:14.32]See you next week.
[224:15.48]That was Neil.fun, by the way.
[224:17.32]It's a great website.
[224:20.89]I don't think I even did half the stuff either.
[224:22.39]They were still at least.
[224:28.76]Probably 7 or 8 experiences.
[224:33.00]You could probably burn a solid 10 hours there.
[224:36.36]That is infinite craft could probably take you all day.
[224:42.59]Finish it another time.
[224:44.39]Maybe.
[224:46.85]Alright, good night everybody.
[224:48.19]Have a good rest of your afternoon.
[224:49.05]Good evening.
[224:52.03]Take care.
[225:26.73]Also, sorry to jump scare you.
[225:29.30]I'm going to leave the campaign going until the end of tonight.
[225:34.34]So if you do, that link should still work until later tonight.
[225:40.48]I know, Mr. Goodboy.
[225:44.92]So I want to make sure I said that as well.
[225:47.04]Alright.
[225:47.62]See you later.
[225:47.94]Have a good one.
[225:55.64]you
[226:30.60]you
