[ve:61.1.100]

[00:25.41]What is happening?
[00:27.09]How are you?
[00:33.64]Welcome to another edition of streaming.
[00:37.22]And chilling.
[00:41.32]Today we've got some older games to go through.
[00:44.70]I got a couple of RPGs I'd like to play.
[00:48.91]I imagine this will be kind of like it was before.
[00:53.41]If I get into it, then I'm going to play it.
[00:55.07]But if I want to move on, I'll just move on.
[01:05.45]I want to play Arcs Fatalis.
[01:09.57]That is an old old OG.
[01:12.81]I think it's Arcane Studios.
[01:13.95]Isn't that Arcane Studios first game they ever made?
[01:18.77]Or one of the one of the first big ones?
[01:29.17]2001?
[01:29.19]I think 2002.
[01:33.28]It's very old.
[01:40.08]Uh, there's also another RPG that's on this list that it... I just... I just got it because it... I don't know.
[01:53.25]We'll probably start with the one that I don't know about.
[01:55.49]Uh...
[01:59.05]It could be a banger.
[02:00.75]A lot of these that we might go through today could be bangers.
[02:03.21]We just don't know.
[02:16.72]Did you install the... I didn't install any mods for it.
[02:20.48]I got its own GOG.
[02:22.82]Usually the GOG version is the one that works better than the Steam versions a lot of times.
[02:31.80]I don't know if the GOG one has any of these fixes or whatever could be there.
[02:50.35]I love a good crusty game.
[02:51.77]I love crust.
[02:52.57]I mean, well, they're not, they're not necessarily crusty.
[02:56.81]They're just a little older.
[02:58.06]They're just a little older.
[03:04.20]Guys, I could be on this list, alright?
[03:05.74]I'm a little crusty.
[03:08.44]Not really.
[03:11.66]Vintage, right?
[03:18.73]Are you guys going to finish Split Fiction?
[03:22.01]I believe so.
[03:29.07]I don't know when, but maybe the end of this week?
[03:41.20]What about red alert?
[03:44.04]Yeah, all all things.
[03:45.32]Is that is yeah, there's a lot of cool stuff to do.
[03:54.40]You finished a story game.
[03:56.64]Released after 2010 and seven years.
[04:05.42]Uh, I don't think that's accurate.
[04:07.96]I I don't think that's accurate.
[04:16.61]Dracula 3, 4, and 5.
[04:18.35]Yeah, that's right.
[04:21.63]Yeah, I played Everhood.
[04:23.03]I beat Everhood.
[04:24.52]I beat, um... I beat Undertale.
[04:28.18]That was... Come on, what are you talking about?
[04:29.66]Detroit Become Human?
[04:31.20]That person's full of shit.
[04:33.96]Don't listen to that person.
[04:36.88]Uh, let's see if the ads kick on here.
[04:39.61]They should be starting in about 15 seconds.
[04:42.35]If they do, great.
[04:43.75]Because then for three minutes or so, we can be on the starting soon and I can go get situated.
[04:48.39]Uh, but if they don't, we will continue to talk until I get cut off.
[04:54.25]When I get cut off, you know, we have this issue sometimes at the start of the stream ads.
[05:00.14]Let's see if they start right now.
[05:03.22]They should be.
[05:05.81]What about Portal 2?
[05:07.91]Portal 2 is an amazing game, but I feel like I've beat it already two or three times.
[05:22.30]It's kind of like Bloodborne 2.
[05:24.64]I would love to play Bloodborne, like a full Bloodborne playthrough, but I've done it so many times that maybe one day.
[05:34.49]I still want to do a Chrono Trigger playthrough.
[05:36.03]What about Everhood 2?
[05:43.45]Yeah, I was going to play Everhood 2, but it's such an intense game.
[05:53.10]I haven't played very many intense games since kind of streaming a lot more regularly here.
[05:59.12]I've not really done anything really intense.
[06:02.89]That game is intense.
[06:04.27]Remember the first one?
[06:05.55]I thought that.
[06:06.11]Oh, here we go.
[06:06.70]See you later.
[06:08.36]Alright, I'll be right back.
[06:12.19]See you in a few minutes.
[07:18.84]I know I said that, you know, there's not going to be any, not going to do anything during an ad break, but here I am.
[07:26.00]It only took me a minute this time to go do what I want to do.
[07:28.18]I'm back.
[07:38.67]What about the Neverhood?
[07:41.82]I would love to.
[07:44.52]It's just, I, I don't, I don't know.
[07:50.08]There's a bug in the Neverhood.
[07:54.61]I'll wait a minute, but you know, I'll just say it again in a minute.
[07:58.85]There's a couple of bugs in the Neverhood that I think with current systems and the current way the game is played, I don't think you can progress for a certain part of the game.
[08:10.19]So you need a save file that's after this one point.
[08:18.40]Ready to go when you get there.
[08:24.98]And I don't have it.
[08:26.24]I'm sure there's probably tons of places.
[08:27.94]I'm surprised it's not on GOG.
[08:30.93]That's really surprising.
[08:33.35]You know what else is not on GOG?
[08:34.47]Total distortion.
[08:47.68]GOG, GOG.
[08:53.20]If you have any issues with Arx Vitalis, you should try the open source engine Arx Libertatis for it.
[08:59.35]Yeah, we'll see.
[09:01.97]I might not even get to it today.
[09:03.93]I just know that I want to.
[09:04.81]Hey, welcome back.
[09:07.43]I was not talking during the ads.
[09:10.96]I was not, and we didn't talk about a ton of shit.
[09:13.32]Sorry, but we did.
[09:19.14]yeah I'd love to play I'd love to do total distortion again I'd love to do uh the neverhood I want to do Chrono Trigger it's just when I wake up in the morning and I look at my hands I put my hands out and I look at my palms and I look at my back of my hands and I'm just like alright like I close my fist and open them I do like I get the blood going and I go what am I what what am I doing today
[09:43.76]What's happening today?
[09:46.81]This old, crusty fucking RPG.
[09:48.73]That's what I'm doing.
[09:55.96]Is the Steam version of Chrono Trigger good?
[09:57.72]I don't know.
[09:58.20]I have not played, I don't think, realistically, any of those remakes.
[10:03.80]They re-released, not remake, they re-released Chrono Trigger four or five times.
[10:07.79]PlayStation 1, DS, Steam, iPad.
[10:13.37]It's been released so many times.
[10:14.55]I just don't know which one is the one that actually is a good one.
[10:17.43]It might even be identical.
[10:23.74]The DS one is the best one.
[10:27.28]Okay, cool.
[10:30.15]Get a Switch release for it.
[10:32.03]Chrono Trigger is just turning into Nintendo's Skyrim.
[10:35.99]They keep putting it on everything.
[10:37.39]I'm surprised it's not on the Switch.
[10:39.65]Was there a Wii port for Chrono Trigger?
[10:41.54]There might have been.
[10:44.68]Or at the very least, it was on the Virtual Console.
[10:49.00]right you guys ready let's do it I'm ready to go uh we're gonna open with this one that we might be only I might only play this game for 10 minutes I do not know this game is called border zone it's a RPG an old RPG
[11:15.31]I don't know if it's any good, but let's go for it.
[11:17.87]I might play it for 10 minutes.
[11:21.86]Let's go.
[11:32.40]One C Company.
[11:39.46]Orion Game Development Studio.
[11:43.44]he said oh no not these guys huh Saturn I thought that was that looked like grinding gear games alright here we go
[12:15.63]This was in every one of these games, that quick, blurry zoom in.
[12:28.90]This could be awesome.
[12:29.96]I'm very excited.
[12:34.62]Carry the baby like a loaf of bread.
[12:36.46]OK.
[12:41.54]I think you do two hands.
[12:42.52]I don't think you need to run with one hand holding.
[12:44.66]Is it your wife?
[12:45.94]I don't know.
[12:46.89]Or daughter?
[12:47.27]I don't know.
[12:49.49]Wait, is that on me?
[12:51.95]I'm going to be the baby.
[12:52.61]I guarantee it.
[12:53.17]I'm the baby.
[13:10.49]So I'm the baby.
[13:13.05]And... I guess?
[13:17.09]I don't know.
[13:21.38]What's this guy?
[13:47.83]Oh, he wanted the- he wanted the jewel, I get it.
[14:03.44]No, he didn't- he did not want the jewel.
[14:06.64]He just threw it away.
[14:07.80]What?
[14:19.73]Would I get found by a group of... I don't know, bannermen or something from one of these towns?
[14:24.30]Okay.
[14:26.32]Name, Olaf.
[14:28.52]Race, human.
[14:29.78]Warrior, mage, or thief.
[14:33.36]Uh, this red text is gonna be very difficult to read.
[14:37.98]Your hero is named Olaf.
[14:40.12]He's about 20 years old.
[14:41.68]Nobody knows the exact date of his birth, as he was found as a baby close to the border fort.
[14:46.51]Probably his parents were killed by brigands.
[14:49.13]But their corpses were not found, although there were signs of a struggle.
[14:58.71]I feel like Thief is going to be way too hard.
[15:00.37]I just want to hit stuff with a stick.
[15:06.51]This is going to... I'm going to have to do... There's got to be a whole system here.
[15:10.55]I'm just going to get a massive weapon.
[15:12.89]I'm doing Warrior.
[15:15.76]Okay.
[15:21.67]One of the soldiers named him after a mythical hero whose heroic deeds were excitingly described by a vagrant musician the night before at the local inn.
[15:33.74]Okay.
[15:35.52]Olaf grew up in the fort northern among soldiers protecting the northern borders of Kamir.
[15:43.66]He was taken in service and was taught the art of combat, but he did not stand out amongst the soldiers.
[15:49.77]Use the deep... Wait, no, no, no.
[15:50.69]Hold on.
[15:52.32]Oh, wait, wait, wait, here we go.
[15:54.76]Alright.
[15:55.84]This red on yellow text is going to drive me insane.
[15:58.52]It's fucking ketchup and mustard display here.
[16:03.20]Vitality 84, mana 35, will 9, weariness.
[16:07.45]What is weariness?
[16:11.91]I mean, it's got to be strength.
[16:13.11]Okay, 10 strength, 10 build.
[16:16.87]I don't care.
[16:17.27]I could be stupid.
[16:19.07]Wait, I need charisma.
[16:19.83]I need charisma.
[16:24.65]How bad is this?
[16:25.91]Is it really?
[16:26.81]Who knows?
[16:27.27]None of you guys have ever played this.
[16:28.39]Neither have I. Maybe I should spread it out a little bit.
[16:30.41]Okay, that's good.
[16:33.09]Seven, seven, two, three, five.
[16:36.76]No, this is going to be to get like lower prices at one store in the whole game.
[16:40.76]Okay.
[16:44.98]Okay.
[16:49.61]Attack, defense, I have stab, slash, cut, crush, explosion, penetrating, heat, cold, electricity, psi effect, acid, poisoning.
[16:59.68]I feel like you learn that later, maybe.
[17:01.74]Uh, magic, I don't have any magic.
[17:07.62]Combat skills, alright, here we go.
[17:08.86]Hand-to-hand fighting.
[17:09.80]Should I just punch people?
[17:12.34]Clubbing, blade, pole, axe, one-handed, two-handed, propellant?
[17:21.34]do club do propellant build I don't even know what that means I'm just going club alright what about ability attention your endurance backstab trade initiates self-restraint I gotta put a couple of points into temperance right
[17:51.48]I have 20 points.
[17:52.46]How about endurance?
[18:01.06]50 endurance.
[18:06.51]Pain spots.
[18:08.47]Maybe that means I'm more resilient.
[18:09.75]I don't know.
[18:11.03]OK, this is fine.
[18:14.89]Uh, hard, average, easy.
[18:17.13]I want to keep, let's keep it on average.
[18:18.21]I'm not doing anything hard in this.
[18:19.88]You ready?
[18:20.70]Can I pick that?
[18:21.16]Can I get a different portrait?
[18:23.50]I think this is just me.
[18:26.74]Yeah, that's me.
[18:30.84]I'm not playing on hard.
[18:31.87]That would be so awful.
[18:37.55]You're going to quit after the first fight with a rat.
[18:39.79]Alright.
[18:40.09]Well, that's your opinion and it's probably right.
[18:45.88]OK, let's go.
[18:46.38]I don't even know how to play.
[18:56.87]OK.
[19:04.09]Here we are.
[19:04.55]Alright, that guy's got a club.
[19:11.08]OK, it's click to move.
[19:21.47]Olaf, where the hell have you been?
[19:23.31]You... chair warmer.
[19:25.91]Lieutenant Ergund has been waiting for you for an hour already.
[19:32.55]Oh, do you know why he asked for me, Slop?
[19:36.66]This guy's name is Slop?
[19:40.04]First, it's not Slop.
[19:41.52]It's Sergeant, sir, for you.
[19:44.14]And second, get your lazy butt to the lieutenant now, foundling.
[19:48.46]Mr. Ergund doesn't like to be kept waiting.
[19:52.25]Okay.
[19:54.45]Go to the lieutenant.
[19:57.09]Can I talk to anybody else?
[20:12.90]Hey, how's life?
[20:14.54]It's fine, unless slop decides he wants to apple polish in front of the lieutenant.
[20:21.32]What does apple polish mean?
[20:24.83]Oh, I'm so tired of this practicing.
[20:26.34]The Sarge is very disappointed.
[20:30.57]Right, but you're the master when it comes to marching, aren't you?
[20:33.29]Haha, safe foundling.
[20:34.61]You owe us a beer.
[20:35.69]You got lucky, as soon as you're back, of course.
[20:39.33]And what's happened?
[20:41.26]Oh, you don't know?
[20:41.94]Looks like Ergen wants to charge you a mission.
[20:45.18]What sort of mission?
[20:47.22]That we don't know, but apparently he wants to send you somewhere with an order.
[20:50.92]Where to?
[20:52.24]Does it matter?
[20:53.16]As long as there is women and booze.
[20:55.04]Hahaha.
[20:56.33]What a pig you are!
[20:58.15]Oh, I see the lieutenant has made a right choice.
[21:00.47]You're not interested in these things, are you?
[21:02.69]Maybe it's only rumors.
[21:04.25]Maybe, maybe... What am I asking him?
[21:08.39]This is like an AI... This is an AI prompt being referred back and forth to.
[21:14.60]Maybe, maybe not.
[21:15.36]Drop by the Citadel and find the... Okay, the Citadel.
[21:17.60]Maybe I will.
[21:18.14]Alright, where's the Citadel?
[21:31.73]What is going to press buttons?
[21:38.22]Save the game.
[21:39.02]How do you save?
[21:42.00]Alright, gotta go to the Citadel.
[21:49.54]Is an animal.
[21:52.91]Dog.
[21:55.31]I can't interact with the dog.
[22:00.25]skills rest map collect all nearby items oh my god what fight switching over to fight mode I can't just punch no I'm not gonna stop to stop I don't think I can do it alright I gotta go to the citadel now if I were a citadel which one of these would I be
[22:30.90]I can't open that one.
[22:31.68]I guess I can go in here.
[22:34.60]Is this the Citadel?
[22:37.00]The music is really loud.
[22:42.13]I don't know if I can fix that.
[22:43.61]Oh, hold on.
[22:47.57]Loudness of music.
[22:51.60]I love that.
[22:52.18]Okay, we turned the loudness of the music down.
[22:57.80]Better?
[22:59.41]I think we're good.
[23:00.87]Maybe a little too light.
[23:02.52]I can turn it up a little bit.
[23:03.24]Alright, is this the Citadel?
[23:14.42]I feel like it's this thing right here.
[23:28.12]Baldur's Gate three stream deck.
[23:29.75]OK, I think this is the Citadel.
[23:41.79]Why should I talk to this guy?
[23:43.61]Hey, how is life?
[23:45.75]OK.
[23:49.29]Merchant.
[23:50.61]What do you want?
[23:51.27]I know you're selling some items.
[23:54.38]I would you want to see them?
[23:55.26]Yes, I do.
[23:57.40]Don't have any money.
[24:00.09]Olaf Parm?
[24:04.91]Like... Like chicken parm?
[24:07.53]What does that mean?
[24:08.21]Olaf Parm?
[24:10.11]I don't know.
[24:10.61]I've never heard that before.
[24:11.31]What's that?
[24:13.65]Olaf Parm?
[24:16.89]This guy doesn't even have a club!
[24:17.83]I have zero money, so I can't do anything anyways.
[24:23.05]Alright, we gotta go find this guy.
[24:29.12]I gotta find the lieutenant.
[24:43.60]And then... Where's the lieutenant?
[24:46.47]How's life?
[24:47.33]Okay.
[24:53.47]Can I steal stuff?
[24:58.95]I just took this stuff for free.
[25:00.33]I just got that for free.
[25:01.27]I didn't have to do anything.
[25:04.56]Do I get in trouble?
[25:05.12]Uh-oh.
[25:15.53]I might be stuck in here.
[25:17.35]Oh, there we go.
[25:19.75]Oh, here's my inventory.
[25:23.60]Oh, should I do have stuff?
[25:24.82]Alright.
[25:25.34]Rim?
[25:29.14]Why is it a garbage bag?
[25:30.64]A bag with herbs?
[25:37.38]A flask of water.
[25:38.51]What is this?
[25:38.83]What is a rim?
[25:43.98]At least I got a... I got a breastplate on now.
[25:47.86]Cool, alright.
[25:48.38]Alright, good luck trying to find where the captain is in here, if I'm even in the right place.
[25:59.71]Oh shit, this is money!
[26:18.17]Maybe I just have to stock up first.
[26:19.37]This is a blanket.
[26:32.85]Hey, this isn't Arx Fatalis.
[26:35.11]It's not.
[26:39.78]I wanted to open with this one first.
[26:41.12]OK, I got a pot of flowers.
[26:47.65]Another one of these.
[26:48.19]Alright, good.
[26:56.30]This game is called Border... Border something.
[27:01.80]I don't remember.
[27:11.94]Border Zone.
[27:12.76]Yeah, OK, the game is called Border Zone.
[27:17.70]well I don't think the lieutenant's up here I don't do I have a map access map only on road locations maybe I just have to leave save the game okay I got it that's saved right
[27:49.93]Can I just steal from this guy?
[27:52.53]Oh my god.
[27:55.03]Okay.
[27:55.31]I don't think they care at all that I'm here.
[27:57.67]I don't know if there's a stealing system.
[28:10.76]Let me head back out.
[28:18.83]I guess maybe this isn't the Citadel?
[28:24.34]I thought this was a thong or like a bikini for a second.
[28:26.78]I was like, why is there a bikini in here?
[28:41.27]I love this music though.
[28:42.41]The music is wonderful.
[28:48.88]Did somebody actually just say how does he know what that is?
[28:55.16]What the fuck are you talking about?
[29:02.69]How old do you think I am?
[29:09.11]How all like sheltered do you think I am?
[29:11.95]What the fuck are you talking about?
[29:14.56]Huh?
[29:17.57]Okay, there's a tavern in here.
[29:18.83]Okay.
[29:25.84]Don't be funny.
[29:26.34]Nobody's leaving the fort inside from the patrols and the Morgau's outpost guards.
[29:33.30]What happened?
[29:33.64]Lieutenant's orders.
[29:35.46]Nobody's allowed to leave.
[29:36.60]But why?
[29:37.24]How would I know?
[29:38.94]Go ask.
[29:39.50]Alright.
[29:39.84]Where is he?
[29:50.02]I can't go in here.
[29:53.69]What the hell is that thing?
[30:00.47]This game just got way more interesting.
[30:02.79]I don't think I gotta stay here for a little bit.
[30:05.39]We need to find the Citadel.
[30:16.50]I can't use the map either.
[30:19.35]I have to find this... Apparently I gotta find this lieutenant.
[30:23.99]I need a weapon.
[30:33.93]There's like pigs in here?
[30:39.45]This game has so much potential.
[30:40.63]I know it.
[30:41.03]I just need to find a... Am I supposed to... This is battle music.
[30:47.09]This is battle music.
[30:48.32]I think...
[30:55.91]No, it's not.
[30:56.71]Where did that funny music go?
[31:04.49]Shit.
[31:05.27]Oh, man.
[31:05.95]This game is called Border Zone.
[31:16.13]I need to find this citadel.
[31:22.14]Go to the citadel.
[31:24.73]Maybe I can just... Can I leave the town?
[31:30.33]That looks like the Citadel.
[31:32.79]You've made no progress.
[31:34.87]Yeah, I mean, what am I supposed to do here?
[31:41.18]The game probably has a manual that says... And the Citadel in the middle of the town of... Yupo.
[31:50.03]I don't even know where we are.
[31:53.37]Press M. Yeah.
[31:54.31]See, I can't even, I can't look at the map.
[32:05.10]Shit.
[32:06.48]No, I can't quit this one already.
[32:08.46]It's too, it's got way too much potential.
[32:10.12]I want to at least kill one fucking like rabid rat.
[32:18.22]Use the other buttons.
[32:19.10]Hold on.
[32:19.30]Let me see.
[32:23.28]Combat mode, Characteristics, Equipment, Items, Panel, Rest, Run, Magic, Sixth, Fifth, Fourth, Third, Second, First.
[32:39.33]Attack all?
[32:40.41]Were you going to attack everybody?
[32:41.83]I love it.
[32:46.61]Alright.
[32:48.63]I wonder if this means something here.
[32:54.51]Is there one of these I haven't gone in yet?
[32:55.63]There's gonna be one guy standing in a corner that's gonna be Lieutenant.
[33:01.93]I can't just leave?
[33:12.18]Shit, it's locked.
[33:16.84]Let me go back in here, because this is the biggest building in this whole area.
[33:23.18]Can you see the color?
[33:24.84]Yeah, I mean, I've already talked to this guy.
[33:29.50]The yellow on the map is just people that you can speak to.
[33:32.62]And it all seems to be these human warrior, human warrior, human warrior.
[33:38.12]I don't see anybody named, what's his name?
[33:40.25]Ingerd?
[33:45.57]Because there's, whatever these are on the map.
[33:47.71]What about, is somebody said they saw blue?
[33:51.85]Try to leave the fort.
[33:52.71]I just did it's unlocked.
[33:59.56]Fuck.
[33:59.86]Alright, I'm going to go in here one more time and see if I can find him.
[34:15.02]This is merchant.
[34:20.83]It's not like, not one of these guys.
[34:23.25]Human warrior, human warrior, human warrior.
[34:25.43]I think there are stairs up the outside.
[34:36.76]Go back outside and go to the door.
[34:37.80]Oh God, somebody just had it.
[34:39.58]Yeah, just, just, if somebody's got the answer, just give it to me.
[34:42.52]Because like, how the hell would I ever find this guy?
[34:46.74]It's like, go find this random named NPC and there's no map.
[34:50.87]Go back outside and go to the door next to the tree.
[34:53.67]That's where you need to go.
[34:55.11]Outside, go to the door next to the tree.
[34:57.41]I got it.
[35:14.22]This big tree, this door here.
[35:22.15]Wait, there's a couple of big trees.
[35:23.35]Okay.
[35:43.35]No, that's not him.
[35:44.21]No, that's not him.
[36:07.71]uh okay he's not in here I think I gotta change game I'm looking for this one guy and he's not here
[36:25.62]yeah I I I mean I could just walk around for an hour and find him but it's just too it's just too out there it's like this one guy that's probably the same model too go up the stairs I'll go up the stairs and if I don't see him then I'm gonna change to uh this first person shooter that I want to play this has potential you mean like up here
[37:00.31]I can't go up these stairs.
[37:01.34]Alright, I'm done with this one.
[37:12.98]I just walked in a circle for 25 minutes.
[37:21.35]This next game is called Chaser.
[37:22.11]Chaser.
[37:38.89]Like DreamWorks?
[37:46.27]This sounds like DreamWorks.
[37:49.75]It's not DreamWorks.
[37:51.65]It is Joe Wood Productions.
[38:01.53]Jesus!
[38:02.64]Oh my god!
[38:09.78]Powered by the Cloak Engine.
[38:18.55]Powered by GameSpy.
[38:20.01]Didn't we just talk about this in like the last room?
[38:24.71]Okay.
[38:25.39]This one's called Chaser.
[38:32.58]Uh, should I do the tutorial?
[38:34.22]Wait, difficulty tutorial.
[38:36.84]There's something easier than easy, apparently.
[38:43.17]Let me do the tutorial.
[38:45.48]uh this mouse sensitivity is yeah that's got it that's got to change it's still it's still it's not gonna be enough
[39:08.91]Okay.
[39:09.25]I'm glad that you gave me the tutorial on what button that is.
[39:11.85]Thanks for telling me.
[39:13.91]Uh huh.
[39:14.23]What's the crouch button?
[39:42.30]well done agent figure it out the tutorial is supposed to tell you what the buttons are open the door and enter the other room open the door using the switch located to the right of the door okay press here got it E sometimes you may not be able to get where you want without jumping over obstacles
[40:11.82]If you take a run up, you'll jump further.
[40:14.68]Now, get to the other side of the room.
[40:18.28]This guy weighs... We're on Mars or something.
[40:21.13]The gravity is so weird.
[40:25.87]Well done, agent.
[40:27.31]You can jump over an obstacle by approaching it and then moving forward during the jump.
[40:32.84]Some obstacles may be too high for a normal jump.
[40:36.49]To jump higher, draw your legs up during the jump by pressing crouch key.
[40:42.00]Jump over the obstacle and move to the next room.
[40:47.96]Well done, Agent.
[40:54.28]You will notice that in this room, there is a pool.
[40:58.02]You will not encounter water or need to dive very often, but you must be ready for anything.
[41:05.11]If you dive beneath the surface, the indicator for the amount of air in your lungs will appear in the bottom left corner of the screen.
[41:12.86]Well, that's not very, that's not very much disappears.
[41:15.70]You will drown.
[41:17.64]So monitor this carefully.
[41:20.82]Well done agent.
[41:22.28]You can move on to the next.
[41:23.62]Can you imagine this being in a training facility?
[41:28.18]Why not just have a regular pool?
[41:30.93]Why can't it just be hold your breath underwater for a minute?
[41:33.57]Why do we have to build this?
[41:35.13]It can't just be a regular pool?
[41:36.43]This resembles a door.
[42:03.53]It looks like two elevator buttons.
[42:04.91]I thought those were spikes.
[42:09.41]Sorry, I was just saying.
[42:10.49]Oh, weapon training.
[42:12.05]Let's go.
[42:21.76]Ooh, thanks for the warning.
[42:23.02]Oh, it has everyone.
[42:24.00]Dude, night vision was the gimmick in the 90s, in the early 2000s.
[42:40.07]Like, this is the loot boxes of 2002.
[42:41.03]It was in every single video game.
[42:42.90]Didn't he say it was gonna automatically turn on?
[43:13.27]You didn't listen?
[43:16.01]I just picked it up.
[43:17.03]Yeah, I did.
[43:17.35]Adrenaline mode.
[43:44.00]Okay, it's F. Okay.
[43:51.59]Cool.
[43:56.42]Actually, this is going to be a banger.
[43:59.14]I already know it.
[44:06.11]Wow, two-part.
[44:06.88]Well done, agent.
[44:08.60]Good work, agent.
[44:10.02]You've performed extremely well up to this point.
[44:13.48]Before we start teaching you weaponry, it's important that you evaluate your status following each encounter.
[44:20.56]In the bottom left corner of the screen, your health status is displayed.
[44:25.63]If this indicator decreases to zero, you will die.
[44:30.75]Try to avoid this, because we'd hate to lose a promising agent.
[44:35.85]Next to the health indicator, you can see your armor status.
[44:40.63]This is primarily the status of your bulletproof vest.
[44:43.35]I think I'm ready for the game.
[44:44.57]I don't think I need to do the entire tutorial.
[44:47.03]The less you will be harmed by enemy fire.
[44:50.26]The armor will degrade after each hit, so if its status is critical, it would be advisable to start looking for a new bulletproof vest.
[44:59.48]Now, you may move on to the next section.
[45:03.49]What the fuck?
[45:03.77]Uh, a special mixture of drugs.
[45:04.47]Sounds good.
[45:24.17]Move towards the table.
[45:25.93]As you can see, an indicator has appeared in the right corner of your screen, which shows the ammunition status of your selected weapon and its power.
[45:35.63]The indicator shows the number of rounds left in your magazine and your total number of rounds.
[45:42.15]If the indicator of the number of rounds is red, then it is time to reload the weapon.
[45:49.02]Do not go into a fight with a near-empty magazine if you can help it.
[45:54.32]Okay.
[45:54.72]Shut up!
[45:55.20]Okay, reload is not R, by the way.
[45:56.62]How is reload not R?
[46:28.10]Dude, this is gonna be fun.
[46:29.52]Alright, I got it.
[46:30.10]I get it.
[46:30.96]Sniper rifle.
[46:49.62]With sniper rifles, switching to firing mode activates zoom.
[46:52.90]Excellent work, agent.
[46:55.04]You've completed your basic training.
[46:56.76]Let's go.
[46:57.66]You will gain further experience when you get into action.
[47:01.68]Good luck.
[47:07.20]Majestic station.
[47:10.92]This is kind of nice looking.
[47:27.96]When did this come out?
[47:28.52]This actually looks pretty good.
[47:32.46]Looks like pretty high fidelity graphics.
[47:40.79]It's pretty smooth.
[47:41.37]This is smooth frame rate too.
[47:44.81]Chaser.
[47:58.99]This is buttery.
[47:59.91]This is actually pretty buttery and creamy.
[48:02.16]I like it a lot.
[48:17.59]Ow.
[48:19.01]Okay, I had to skip that.
[48:21.83]I'm not going to fucking look at that.
[48:23.67]I'm not going to look at that.
[48:36.42]I think that's me.
[48:40.70]The ship looks like it's about to blow up at any moment.
[48:42.51]I should look for a safety module.
[48:43.71]Escape in it and find out what... Okay.
[48:47.79]I should escape the ship.
[48:50.38]Wow.
[48:52.36]That's pretty cool.
[48:54.02]Majestic mainframe.
[48:55.00]Please use your ID.
[49:08.82]Is this scary music?
[49:10.52]This is scary violin sounds.
[49:12.60]Okay.
[49:38.61]Can I get?
[49:39.21]Alright, I can go in here.
[49:39.97]I don't have a weapon.
[49:44.80]This game has scary music and I don't like that.
[50:01.87]Oh my God, what did I do?
[50:03.21]Can I get the gun?
[50:08.80]Oh shit.
[50:09.52]Okay.
[50:10.58]Nice.
[50:22.37]What?
[50:22.55]You're messing with the chaser.
[50:40.65]The gunplay is fun.
[50:43.05]That was good recoil.
[50:45.21]That was good reaction.
[50:47.03]I just wish my screen would stop shaking.
[50:50.37]I have 18 health.
[50:59.28]How do you reload?
[51:14.13]Oh my goodness, this is killing me.
[51:27.14]Damn alright.
[51:52.81]No, can't go this way.
[51:56.04]Oh, that's not good.
[52:04.52]This game sucks.
[52:06.16]No, it does not.
[52:07.86]We're in the opening get out of the ship sequence and somebody is just grabbing both of the sides of your head.
[52:20.51]And shaking it.
[52:31.06]Did something land on my head?
[52:34.22]What?
[52:36.48]What just fell on my head?
[52:39.65]Oh my god, I have to... What's quicksave?
[52:43.47]How do you quicksave?
[52:45.85]Oh shit.
[52:47.01]How do you quicksave?
[52:49.03]Oh god.
[52:49.90]Damn it.
[52:50.50]Okay, I need to get through that.
[52:52.08]I want to get out of here.
[52:58.55]I gotta save it all the time.
[52:59.85]Save.
[53:01.43]New slot.
[53:01.97]Save.
[53:02.85]Good.
[53:04.15]Okay, there we go.
[53:09.55]F5 is quick save?
[53:10.35]Okay, let's go.
[53:16.64]Speedrun.
[53:22.94]I don't even know how I died, but at least it was fairly humorous looking.
[53:39.85]There's some of these grenades in this game.
[53:41.51]You probably drive a car.
[53:42.55]We're going to be here for a little bit.
[53:43.77]It's F2.
[53:45.99]F6 and F9.
[53:46.73]Alright.
[53:47.41]Good to know.
[53:48.13]F6.
[53:50.02]Beautiful.
[53:50.40]Alright.
[53:50.72]Got it.
[54:12.89]Alright, you can actually take a lot of damage.
[54:18.35]They hurt a lot.
[54:19.17]What?
[54:49.60]Yeah, the horror violin sounds are just freaking me out.
[54:52.46]Does this guy have to get a key card or something?
[54:59.02]Key card?
[55:00.96]No?
[55:11.58]Roll control that recoil.
[55:16.19]I just got in the game!
[55:22.41]I don't even control that recoil.
[55:24.25]I shot the gun a total of eight times.
[55:43.17]Okay, keep going.
[55:46.95]I shouldn't even zoom in, honestly.
[55:48.23]You get less recoil by holding the button down.
[55:50.56]Alright, I died in here.
[55:53.62]Didn't I?
[55:54.50]Where was it?
[56:02.44]Yeah, no, the game is very creamy, so I'm down.
[56:18.52]Stop saying that.
[56:20.57]How would you...
[56:25.20]I that's how I'm going to describe the game because that's what I mean.
[56:27.71]That's how I feel.
[56:28.27]Alright, this is how I died in here.
[56:35.79]I'm just sitting in a massage chair on high.
[56:42.07]That's what it feels like playing this.
[56:44.79]Alright, so what happened to me in here?
[56:52.57]And how did that kill me before?
[57:08.90]Boom.
[57:14.02]I'm good.
[57:17.52]Anymore?
[57:19.78]Where are you?
[57:33.08]I want a different gun.
[57:41.85]I only have four health and I just saved it.
[57:43.69]That's not a good idea.
[57:50.29]Is there a health pack anywhere?
[58:01.32]No health packs.
[58:03.64]You gotta lock in.
[58:04.75]I am so locked in right now.
[58:05.91]You have no idea.
[58:07.93]It's a beautiful day outside.
[58:16.11]I had a bunch of rice.
[58:17.01]I got a coke right here.
[58:24.58]Where is he?
[58:36.29]Where is he?
[58:57.16]Alright, save it.
[59:06.20]That was a good sound.
[59:11.81]I could softlock myself, so I gotta be careful.
[59:26.48]Stop shaking my entire room.
[59:40.13]Finally.
[59:49.36]Check settings to turn off the shake.
[59:51.94]I would be shocked.
[59:55.38]If you can turn the screen shake off.
[60:03.21]No, no, no.
[60:27.27]no no guys you cannot has it already been an hour have I just been sitting around as I'm I'm having way too much fun for an entire hour to have passed where uh where do I go from here I got health thank god
[60:58.57]I can't go up even further.
[61:04.61]Climb the boxes.
[61:07.04]Oh, that's right.
[61:07.68]I can climb the boxes.
[61:08.56]I need to rebind that to control.
[61:12.68]Let's do it right now.
[61:19.38]Alright.
[61:19.64]Reload mouse three.
[61:21.44]What are you talking about?
[61:23.50]That's fine.
[61:24.10]Next weapon.
[61:24.52]That's fine.
[61:25.12]Last use.
[61:25.56]That's fine.
[61:26.02]Drop weapon is fine.
[61:27.88]Activate is fine.
[61:30.30]Left shift is fine.
[61:31.24]Crouch control.
[61:33.50]Jump space.
[61:34.02]That's good.
[61:35.22]Adrenaline mode.
[61:35.94]That's fine.
[61:36.64]I don't know what that is yet, but it sounds pretty fucking sweet.
[61:40.68]Tab.
[61:41.04]Okay.
[61:44.84]Buy screen.
[61:54.39]Oh, please.
[62:03.48]What?
[62:17.02]The fuck?
[62:19.10]Where is he?
[62:24.08]I got shot in the back.
[62:25.10]Is he right behind this?
[62:34.45]Oh my goodness.
[62:39.88]It's sticky and weird.
[62:41.86]It's weird.
[62:42.28]Ah, that was finally.
[62:50.97]Save it.
[62:57.61]Give me that.
[63:01.53]Good.
[63:04.37]Full health.
[63:04.87]Perfect.
[63:05.27]Alright, let's go.
[63:06.89]Game is saved.
[63:07.56]Where's the escape pod?
[63:36.80]You could have told me I've just walked in a circle and I would believe you.
[63:41.50]I actually don't even know if this could be the beginning of the game where I loaded for the first time.
[63:55.54]See, there's the same dead guy.
[63:57.08]What the fuck?
[64:02.98]What is this?
[64:06.25]That was... I didn't lose that much health.
[64:10.59]I freaked out for no reason.
[64:11.37]Alright.
[64:17.93]I'm going to do a hard save.
[64:19.63]And then I'm going to take a break.
[64:23.61]We got a lot to go through today, so I'll be right back.
[64:29.26]Let me get a hard save here.
[64:33.86]And I will back in three, four minutes.
[64:39.57]See you very, very soon.
[64:40.97]Get up and move around.
[70:03.75]Okay.
[70:05.97]I am ready.
[70:09.08]Very interested.
[70:17.56]So where were we?
[70:26.97]Right.
[70:27.29]Loud noises.
[70:28.05]I forgot.
[70:28.23]Okay.
[70:38.28]Alright, how annoying is it going to be if the whole game does the screen shake every 5 seconds?
[70:45.18]Even outside of the spaceship.
[70:53.86]I go the right way.
[70:54.42]Did I turn around?
[71:03.00]Idiot.
[71:04.43]What did he shoot at?
[71:13.14]I cannot believe I didn't kill that guy.
[71:14.80]Okay.
[71:32.77]Now what?
[71:34.17]Oh God.
[71:35.20]God.
[71:35.78]Oh God.
[71:38.44]Oh my God.
[71:39.84]I feel like I'm in a Star Wars game, but using real bullets.
[71:54.53]Be serious.
[71:55.71]Oh that guy.
[71:56.45]I don't even care.
[72:01.43]Nothing.
[72:12.92]Press G to switch that fire mode up.
[72:18.47]I think it's burst and auto.
[72:25.99]I have to go down, definitely.
[72:38.67]I feel bad that I skipped the opening cutscene, but it was scrambling my brain.
[72:43.43]I could feel it was itching inside of my head when I was looking at that.
[73:02.08]Is that a friend?
[73:02.94]I don't know.
[73:14.67]Alright, so where do I go?
[73:15.59]This ship is only corridors.
[73:27.09]Yeah, there's nothing else on this.
[73:28.69]Where's the kitchen?
[73:31.37]Where's the mess hall?
[73:32.72]Where's the captain's quarters?
[73:37.10]Where's the bunk beds?
[73:38.92]Where's anything?
[73:39.84]It's just hallways.
[73:46.39]There's no bathrooms.
[73:47.53]There's no... It's only fucking corridors.
[73:56.69]How would you not get so lost on this ship?
[74:02.52]It's like a beehive.
[74:06.84]Look at this!
[74:07.68]How would you ever navigate?
[74:10.12]People would die down here.
[74:11.36]They wouldn't even be able... You'd never find them ever again.
[74:19.48]That guy was lost down here.
[74:20.62]He's probably been here since Christmas.
[74:21.80]Oh, no, I can't get in there.
[74:40.09]Down again.
[74:40.99]Okay, so... What else is there, man?
[74:48.26]I just got a lot of gear, so I'm going to assume that this is probably complete progress.
[74:55.76]Maybe forward progress.
[75:04.21]I I'm going to go this way.
[75:10.62]I'm quick loading just I'm quick loading I'm quick loading I'm quick loading just kill me no I'm not moving anymore you're right
[75:38.27]Wait, what?
[75:39.59]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[75:40.91]What is this?
[75:41.29]Did I?
[75:49.58]Shit, I'm going the wrong way.
[75:50.50]I need to find that place.
[75:55.06]I need to find the bucket with the gear in it.
[75:58.40]How did I get turned around?
[76:06.80]Here it is.
[76:07.24]Alright, save it right here.
[76:08.44]God, alright.
[76:09.34]I'm ready.
[76:16.37]One more.
[76:27.25]Anybody seen the captain?
[76:32.11]Go find the escape pod.
[76:35.65]Sure.
[76:41.11]This room's different.
[76:42.39]Okay, this room is an electrified pool.
[76:46.78]Doesn't that look like a guy aiming a gun at me?
[76:50.46]That looks like he's aiming down sights right there and he's got a mohawk.
[76:54.40]You see it?
[76:56.83]That's the shine from his sniper rifle.
[76:58.49]He has a mohawk right there.
[77:00.11]There's his eye.
[77:01.39]There's the rifle.
[77:10.25]Oh, it kind of was a guy.
[77:11.15]I think I made it.
[77:20.67]All... Majestic mainframe is not accessible.
[77:23.59]All previous tasks have been canceled.
[77:25.55]Proceed to rescue pods.
[77:26.95]Thank you.
[77:27.35]Alright, give me a rescue pod.
[77:38.52]Where are the rescue pods?
[77:42.30]I thought this was the rescue pods.
[77:44.06]What?
[77:49.92]Can I jump over this?
[77:50.62]There's more hallways.
[78:06.33]It's another group of hallways.
[78:13.52]I want to see this drawn out.
[78:15.68]I want to see the anthill that this is.
[78:24.83]They're experimenting on us, right?
[78:26.17]We're all on some kind of fucked up rug or something, and we think there's a bunch of hallways and we think we're fighting each other.
[78:31.39]Is that a monster?
[78:46.12]Is this the escape pod?
[78:47.94]Dude, what the fuck?
[78:52.65]What?
[78:54.65]Why?
[78:55.15]Oh, rescue pods.
[78:57.83]Alright, finally.
[78:58.61]Ugh.
[79:16.42]Okay, another huge hallway.
[79:21.20]And here, this is an escape pod, I think.
[79:24.44]You gotta climb a ladder to get... What kind of escape pod means you have to climb a 50-foot ladder?
[79:35.29]Am I in it?
[79:39.38]They made this shit so hard to find that only one of us is going to be able to find it.
[79:42.56]If you only got five escape pods, I get it.
[79:46.30]Make it impossible.
[79:47.08]There's probably three or four hundred people on this ship.
[79:51.90]Here we go.
[79:53.10]Hey.
[79:54.60]Bingo.
[79:56.54]We made it.
[80:09.70]Probably get shot down in a second here.
[80:23.94]What was this game about?
[80:24.80]We missed the opening cutscene because I hit jammed the space button.
[80:31.80]Because like somebody put like a fork in my brain's outlet and I was like I couldn't fucking see anything.
[81:00.24]Hey.
[81:08.87]It is very creamy though.
[81:12.77]Look at all that whipped cream coming out.
[81:13.91]Look at that flavored whipped cream is like lemon whipped cream is awesome.
[81:43.54]Does my character talk?
[81:49.60]Almost.
[81:49.92]I think you'd have a much more extreme reaction.
[82:04.89]Wouldn't he just be a skeleton at this point?
[82:06.40]He'd just be a bones like burnt up bones.
[82:25.24]Okay, so that character's dead.
[82:42.66]You gotta put a bruise on him or... He has a skeleton!
[82:45.46]He's really... He's a skeleton?
[82:48.85]Oh no, it's a flashback.
[82:54.72]I love how there's just no damage at all to anywhere on his head.
[83:07.84]Anywhere on his body.
[83:25.20]Alright, so now what do I do?
[83:33.45]Don't even think about shaking.
[83:34.77]It's gonna shake the screen every five seconds, isn't it?
[83:39.23]Those damn raiders kill everyone in their homes, especially ones who crash into their building.
[83:43.16]I have to fight through their territory.
[83:53.44]Music's pretty good.
[84:02.24]Oops.
[84:09.71]What is this guy?
[84:14.61]Was that the guy that said, hey?
[84:38.22]so far there's only one person in here is this guy just selling a weed out of his fucking closet it's the only guy here
[84:55.62]no dude I don't I don't want to try the weed that you're growing next to your like cardigan sorry man
[85:19.25]Yeah.
[85:19.37]Oh, the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-
[85:58.01]Why is this building hallways too?
[85:59.37]It kinda is.
[86:04.36]Yeah, it kinda is.
[86:04.96]Well, there's an outdoor area here.
[86:34.47]This reminds me of, um, that game Kingpin.
[86:53.48]What the hell is going on?
[86:56.12]Dude, what are you doing?
[86:58.48]Who's throwing that shit off the building?
[87:11.11]Oh shit.
[87:13.75]I need health.
[87:20.86]What?
[87:24.54]Okay.
[87:40.96]At least that guy was courteous enough to tell me, right?
[87:46.48]I'm going to keep this.
[87:47.88]Why use any other gun?
[87:52.40]That can definitely kill you.
[87:53.58]Yeah.
[88:10.39]Good, alright.
[88:13.31]Save it, please.
[88:14.55]Thank you.
[88:15.05]There he is!
[88:51.90]Oh, look out.
[89:00.39]The game is still... What the fuck?
[89:04.95]Where are they shooting me from?
[89:08.10]I'm staying back.
[89:08.84]I'm staying way back.
[89:32.37]Are they up here?
[89:50.10]I knew you were up here.
[89:51.06]Where?
[90:14.36]Right in the head.
[90:14.85]Got him.
[90:17.80]Alright, now what?
[90:44.78]here nope let's quick load I don't think I can open this door that's the first door I've been able to open this whole time I've not been able what is that gun
[91:18.14]Ooh, okay.
[91:24.13]Slowest reaction time ever.
[91:25.85]That's the first door I've been able to open since I've played the game.
[91:30.74]No other door opens in this entire apartment complex.
[91:33.66]Are you mad at me that I didn't open the one door that's the same texture and the same color?
[91:48.49]Ooh, nice load up.
[91:50.95]Does one of these actually open?
[92:07.10]It's called gamer sense.
[92:17.77]Do I jump out of this?
[92:20.56]Go under it?
[92:30.06]I should be able to go in there.
[92:41.83]Where'd that guy come from?
[92:48.87]There we go.
[92:53.99]You gotta be kidding me, right?
[92:57.17]You can't be serious.
[92:58.04]You have to be kidding me.
[93:02.58]What?
[93:07.68]Why are they all out here now?
[93:34.34]Oh shit, OK, OK, I can do this.
[93:39.77]I'm in trouble.
[93:43.81]Hold on.
[93:51.33]We're good.
[94:02.80]OK, a rooftop.
[94:07.96]No, oops.
[94:13.60]No!
[94:14.58]Why would you reload this for that long?
[94:24.51]So do we even know why there's any conflict right now in this game?
[94:36.30]I don't know.
[94:39.74]It's just people are shooting at you, so shoot at them back.
[94:50.51]I don't know why I'm doing this.
[94:51.77]I don't know who I am.
[94:52.87]I don't know who they are.
[94:53.91]I know that they're a gang or something or of some kind.
[95:07.70]But I don't know why I'm deciding I'm going to fight all of them.
[95:11.29]I just crash landed like a meteor in a spaceship.
[95:15.81]And the first thing I decide to do is I'm just going to fight my way out of here.
[95:19.06]Apparently shit is going crazy on Earth.
[95:24.04]They're even making growling sounds at each other.
[95:35.84]There we go, good.
[95:38.93]You drew first blood?
[95:42.43]Did I though?
[95:43.03]I feel like I was already met with hostility right when I got here.
[95:56.50]Did somebody just throw his milk at me?
[96:00.18]What did that guy do?
[96:13.17]Yeah, yeah, okay Okay, this gotta be... What was that?
[96:35.84]What am I doing?
[96:39.17]Why am I getting jumpscares?
[96:40.53]Was that my past or something?
[96:50.47]Dude.
[97:05.04]Get out of here.
[97:10.08]Rollercoaster Tycoon?
[97:13.15]Was it actually from Rollercoaster Tycoon?
[97:15.79]Wait, what?
[97:42.25]Oh my god, stop it.
[97:45.69]Not when I'm trying to jump over a fence.
[97:47.23]Don't do that when I'm jumping a fence.
[97:48.68]Okay.
[98:11.88]Here we go explanation.
[98:12.88]I don't think the main character talks.
[98:45.04]I didn't skip, I swear.
[98:46.06]Oh hell yeah.
[99:12.13]I love how I blend in here because I'm just the same guy as everybody else.
[99:16.95]That's just me with the suit on right next to me.
[99:23.05]So they know it's me?
[99:25.89]Bar.
[99:42.53]Why did that guy start crouching?
[99:45.05]Oh boy.
[99:45.71]Okay.
[99:47.65]Uh... I love this.
[99:48.25]This game is... I love this game.
[99:49.31]It's like...
[100:09.71]That's a really high bar.
[100:11.82]That goes up to your neck.
[100:16.56]Hey, bartender.
[100:18.64]Whiskey and ice.
[100:21.32]Voice reveal.
[100:23.38]I ain't seen you here before.
[100:25.52]For the last few hours, I've been called Chaser.
[100:29.11]Same name as the guy on TV.
[100:31.67]Actually, I'm sort of afraid the TV guy and me might be one and the same person.
[100:37.17]That's not true.
[100:38.05]I did the whole ship sequence.
[100:39.98]Okay.
[100:56.43]You minutes?
[100:57.47]I was on that trip for an hour.
[100:58.55]So you're something like the black sheep of the family?
[101:14.83]Damn.
[101:38.04]Can't you get rid of it somehow?
[101:40.04]Too many secrets at once, Chico.
[101:42.48]The only thing you need is my advice.
[101:45.82]Turn around.
[101:46.80]Make a break for it through that door and don't stop till you see the first palm trees.
[101:50.90]Get out of this city as fast as you can and while you still can.
[101:55.12]But what do you mean?
[101:56.24]I... Hear me, chaser.
[101:58.06]You are the perfect candidate for a spider.
[102:00.59]And if you don't split this popsicle joint, there's a probability close to a certainty that you'll get one.
[102:10.50]Alright.
[102:13.04]Very important to remember, I just crashed from outer space into the ground.
[102:18.38]I was just a meteor.
[102:27.96]Stop the laughter.
[102:29.34]You mean the... I can't do it.
[102:41.77]Whereas you, Mr. Chaser, were recognized even by Tommy.
[102:45.91]This isn't happening.
[102:47.35]Don't be so simple, Mr. Chaser.
[102:49.63]Your fame and price increase with every news report.
[102:53.63]Murders, hijackings, and now, majestic.
[102:58.01]Man, you are a gift from heaven.
[103:01.23]War with Yakuza is about to start, and a guy with your skills can only be useful to us.
[103:07.84]It sounds like I don't have much choice.
[103:11.84]I think I do.
[103:18.93]Car level please.
[103:20.69]Let's have it go up one full letter grade.
[103:22.39]Come on.
[103:22.69]That's Microsoft Sam.
[103:38.35]This is an old meme video.
[103:40.73]Squeeze head and shake violently.
[104:01.46]Did I agree to do this?
[104:02.61]Didn't he just say we need you to help us fight people?
[104:05.95]Why are they going to bury a picket in my skull?
[104:13.16]I didn't agree to this at all.
[104:41.45]It did look like the Batmobile.
[104:48.08]Oh, let me drive it.
[104:48.93]Come on!
[105:07.01]Now I have powers.
[105:07.37]I'm gonna laugh really hard if I just shoot this guy immediately after coming out of the cutscene.
[105:36.19]The item in your neck can cause some trouble.
[105:44.75]From now on, you gotta be damn careful.
[105:47.40]The Spider has something like a switch.
[105:49.66]If you try to go against Valero, or commit some other hot-blooded stupidity, he can blast you.
[105:55.85]What should I do according to you?
[105:57.49]The point is to keep quiet and do whatever they want from you.
[106:00.83]After a few successful jobs, they'll leave you in peace.
[106:03.59]Then there'll be time to get rid of the spider and Vamoose out of the city.
[106:08.44]Vamoose.
[106:09.80]And follow me.
[106:11.40]They're expecting us in the kitchen.
[106:12.82]Okay, let's do it.
[106:16.38]Sit down and listen.
[106:19.22]We got a message that the Japs contacted somebody from the islands.
[106:22.64]Somebody they call Big Jack.
[106:25.48]His presence in Montax City can imbalance the scale to our disadvantage.
[106:30.60]This building is our target.
[106:34.40]From the third floor of this barrack, you have a wonderful view of the flat where the Japs will meet the man from the islands.
[106:40.72]The good news is that they're just removing debris from the falling Majestic.
[106:45.32]The bad news is that it belongs to Yakuza.
[106:49.35]Repair work is going on around the clock, workers are there by night, and even worse, there is security.
[106:55.94]This is a big problem.
[106:58.26]If they find out they're wired, the whole mission will bust wide open.
[107:01.46]It's gotta be done without a single shot.
[107:04.02]Mr. Chaser will sneak in, and by means of this facility, find out what Agawa is preparing.
[107:09.39]How do I get inside and how can I orient myself afterwards?
[107:13.21]You're not gonna talk that loud.
[107:14.15]I'm right in front of you.
[107:15.31]...by the main engineer of the construction company that's doing the repairs.
[107:19.49]Gomez will be in the car monitoring the position on your spider on the computer and will guide you if you need it.
[107:26.29]Can my exact position be monitored using the spider?
[107:29.70]Only for a short distance.
[107:31.32]The spider's signal isn't strong enough for us to locate you in HQ during the whole mission, which is why I gotta come with you.
[107:38.26]But a signal for your spider to explode, I can send all the way to Alaska.
[107:43.66]Got that?
[107:45.06]So if you have no further questions... So what you're saying is if you're further than Alaska, then I'm fine.
[107:50.77]So I'll just make sure that I'm somewhere in Europe within the next few hours.
[107:55.99]Why would you tell me the range?
[108:02.61]Okay, here we are.
[108:04.68]I'm going to have to walk around a bunch of hallways.
[108:24.59]Don't make any noise and watch out that nobody spots you.
[108:28.07]You copy?
[108:29.49]I'm not deaf.
[108:30.73]I hope not.
[108:32.14]We didn't find out how many security cameras are in the house.
[108:36.22]Look at the center console there.
[108:37.74]That is insane.
[108:41.32]Yeah, like, um...
[108:57.98]Is this the company car, or is this the guy's personal car?
[109:01.37]This thing is very loud, very, very, voice versus, uh, this is not a discreet car.
[109:07.87]This is fucking Hot Wheels.
[109:09.41]Yeah.
[109:18.22]Somebody's looking out the blinds right now being like, ah, hey, uh, anybody got a, uh, flaming fucking Hot Wheels, uh, covered in orange and yellow paint, big, loud?
[109:30.72]No?
[109:31.10]None of us?
[109:31.76]Okay.
[109:33.38]Get your guns ready.
[109:37.73]He's driving around in a toy car.
[109:42.47]That is, okay, that's pretty cool, though.
[109:44.65]That is a pretty cool car.
[109:48.83]Okay.
[109:51.35]So... I don't have any weapons, right?
[109:53.95]I need to be discreet about this?
[109:57.75]Ow!
[109:58.25]Ow!
[110:01.18]Who's shooting me?
[110:01.96]Why are they killing me?
[110:02.82]I didn't do anything!
[110:10.58]Did he say so- Did he say sorry?
[110:13.32]Goodbye?
[110:18.18]It's a stealth mission.
[110:19.54]Oh, great.
[110:31.06]And I can't move if I get caught.
[110:33.04]You actually can't get caught.
[110:35.32]I can't get over that car.
[110:38.62]I can't get over the car.
[110:40.30]It's too good.
[110:41.58]That's such a great way to put this.
[110:43.60]It's kind of fucked up in the front too.
[110:45.23]Okay.
[110:48.65]So I go around, I don't know.
[110:52.71]I love that car.
[110:58.09]Can I at least bop them in the back of the head?
[111:24.28]They weren't even looking!
[111:27.91]What the fuck?
[111:30.23]Is he ready to run inside?
[111:38.41]And then he said, sorry.
[111:39.67]Puppet combo music?
[111:46.88]Yeah, actually it does kind of sound like it.
[111:51.02]Okay, I'm not going to move.
[111:54.58]Because it triggered his dialog, right?
[111:56.20]Is this poison?
[111:57.40]This looks poisonous.
[112:00.02]I'm fine.
[112:01.64]Actually, I'm not fine.
[112:03.84]I'm not fine.
[112:04.50]I can't get out of here.
[112:05.16]Okay.
[112:05.38]I'm going to wait until he gives me the signal.
[112:12.35]I didn't... Oh, God.
[112:13.37]Darn it.
[112:27.94]Now?
[112:28.06]What do you mean now?
[112:29.56]They're coming to look for me.
[112:30.61]How am I going to run by this guy?
[112:40.15]Oh shit.
[112:47.66]What the fuck is going on?
[112:51.28]What the hell is that?
[112:54.90]I'm on a lot of drugs apparently.
[112:58.15]What?
[112:58.43]Huh?
[113:04.34]I'm gonna puke.
[113:05.14]Um... Okay.
[113:10.84]Are they shooting at the painters?
[113:12.32]Uh...
[113:29.01]Somebody just snapped my neck.
[113:30.91]I just choked on something.
[113:31.75]I choked on my gum.
[113:34.49]Something was not right here.
[113:35.35]Something's not right here.
[113:36.43]This game I think is a little broken right now.
[113:38.11]I can't reload my save.
[113:40.85]You two keep the noise down.
[114:04.67]Okay.
[114:07.03]Go.
[114:07.13]Got it.
[114:07.57]Left door.
[114:07.91]Close it.
[114:33.83]use the door that's left of the stairs yep camera camera did you see the camera okay okay I need more than an okay I need you to tell me where to go I need way more than an okay thanks for nothing
[115:03.00]Okay, now go up the stairs.
[115:11.88]Is somebody screaming?
[115:13.08]What was that?
[115:21.43]You're going the wrong way.
[115:22.71]Get sorry.
[115:24.15]Goodbye, Chico.
[115:24.87]What do you mean goodbye?
[115:25.91]What do you mean I'm going to... You're not going to help me anymore because I walked up the stairs wrong for one second?
[115:34.29]Didn't I just?
[115:38.19]That's what I just did.
[115:39.19]When you tell somebody to go up the stairs and then you give them no other information, I'm going to continue to go up the stairs.
[115:53.06]Now what?
[116:11.34]Right second door on the left.
[116:13.20]Okay.
[116:13.32]Now what?
[116:13.82]Somebody...
[116:39.27]Am I supposed to be able to do this?
[116:41.03]What are you waiting for?
[116:43.03]We don't got the whole night for this.
[116:44.99]In a few minutes the jig will be up.
[116:47.13]I can't do anything.
[116:48.49]There's a couple of painters here.
[116:51.68]No, the painters are gone.
[116:55.82]They're hiding too.
[116:56.78]They're crouching.
[116:57.54]They're putting footprints everywhere.
[116:59.54]Okay.
[117:00.50]I'm on the main stairs.
[117:01.62]Good man.
[117:03.19]Go up the stairs.
[117:04.05]Sorry.
[117:04.27]Goodbye, Chico.
[117:15.25]What keeps happening to me?
[117:16.39]Oh, the camera.
[117:18.35]Okay, there's a camera.
[117:19.65]Alright, camera, camera, camera.
[117:23.87]I have to hide from the camera.
[117:25.31]Don't stop the mission.
[117:26.29]Don't make me choke on my fucking gum yet.
[117:28.32]There's a camera.
[117:49.33]Oh shit.
[117:51.29]Where do I go?
[117:58.84]This room was only made to hide it in a video game.
[118:03.15]This room's only purpose is to hide from that guy in this video game.
[118:24.35]Down the corridor right to the end or down the corridor right to the end?
[118:28.21]Don't say the word right unless you mean right.
[118:31.83]What do you mean to be down here?
[118:32.81]Hey, down the corridor alright to the end.
[118:40.42]Take that word out of your vocabulary when you give directions like this.
[118:43.36]Oh sorry.
[118:48.34]OK.
[118:59.27]It's also a really confusing ass place.
[119:02.18]What?
[119:02.46]Like, where are we?
[119:04.60]Is that person dead?
[119:07.20]He's not gonna shoot me?
[119:28.69]Didn't even try.
[119:31.09]Why didn't he just shoot me?
[119:33.69]I was just checking on him.
[119:34.55]I thought the guy was in trouble or something.
[119:36.19]I don't know.
[119:39.13]That is not somebody sleeping.
[119:40.37]That is a dead guy.
[119:42.34]Nobody sleeps like that.
[119:44.28]You find me somebody that sleeps like this.
[119:46.38]This guy has rigor mortis.
[119:47.54]That's not sleeping.
[119:50.94]Hey, are you sleeping?
[119:53.00]No, that's a guard from security.
[119:55.22]Don't wake him up.
[120:05.74]I wish I could just take his gun out of his hand.
[120:07.20]So I actually have to jump over the carpet.
[120:21.73]Left to the end of the corridor.
[120:39.12]There's so many doors.
[120:40.24]So many empty room.
[120:43.41]What's even in here?
[120:46.85]There's a hallway into a door, but... Not that door, Chaser.
[120:52.21]Yes, this is the right way.
[120:53.35]It is.
[120:54.09]I know what I'm doing now.
[120:55.43]Wrong door.
[120:56.43]Oh, actually, I don't know.
[120:57.39]Wait.
[120:57.95]All the way to the end?
[120:58.57]Good.
[121:00.66]Now in and right.
[121:04.26]In position.
[121:06.08]We're lucky.
[121:07.02]We just managed.
[121:10.86]Who am I taking up?
[121:12.60]So, Ogawa-san, you wanted to talk to us.
[121:17.61]We need help.
[121:18.49]Do I need to open the window?
[121:19.37]A few years ago, the whole city was at our feet.
[121:22.71]We controlled the police, the mayor, and even the senate.
[121:26.49]Our business was going well.
[121:28.43]Montauk City was booming.
[121:30.43]It was truly a jewel of the north.
[121:33.08]The percentage of our taxes transferred to the islands was the basis...
[121:38.08]for the current immense power of the big dragon.
[121:42.45]The big dragon does not forget, Ogawa-san.
[121:46.47]Yes.
[121:48.05]Thank you.
[121:49.27]Five years ago, after the big fire, all our power vanished in smoke from the ruins of Little Tokyo.
[121:58.16]Overnight, we lost practically everything we had been building for years.
[122:03.38]The entire district was reduced to ashes.
[122:07.35]And then we were on our knees and pressed under the Earth.
[122:12.51]No one's going to look out that fucking window.
[122:14.81]There's a guy right there.
[122:18.48]I believe that it was he and his people who were behind the fire.
[122:23.06]Are you not overestimating Valero's power?
[122:26.10]The fire started in dozens of places at the same time.
[122:30.70]It was hell.
[122:32.35]What?
[122:32.55]Was I supposed to be shooting somebody?
[122:55.13]No, no, no, no.
[122:55.49]I'm not ready for instructions.
[122:56.45]Go back to the corridor room and big room.
[122:57.77]Go left at the end.
[122:58.35]Okay, I don't know what that was.
[122:59.79]I don't know what you were just trying to tell me.
[123:02.29]But this is the first bathroom in the game and oh, it is a weird one.
[123:10.92]Is this a TV here?
[123:12.26]This is a big screen TV.
[123:15.08]This is a very interesting looking sink.
[123:20.86]And what's this?
[123:21.52]Is this like the Sith?
[123:22.82]What is this for?
[123:25.28]I guess I could... I don't know.
[123:28.70]Oh, it's a tub.
[123:32.44]How many bullets do I have in this thing?
[123:35.26]Okay, I can't shoot this.
[123:38.32]Alright, through the corridor to the... I don't remember what he said.
[123:44.09]He'll just tell me.
[123:45.71]Good.
[123:46.21]Okay.
[123:48.69]Alright, I got a break coming up here.
[123:49.81]I'm gonna take it.
[123:53.83]Uh, this game is fucked.
[123:56.61]But I'm still, I still kind of want to see what happens at the end of this.
[124:09.49]I'll be right back.
[124:14.42]That started off, this game started off really like, oh, you're just kind of walking around.
[124:17.90]There's like a hundred hallways and you just shoot stuff, I guess.
[124:22.18]It's, this game is getting a little weird.
[124:27.30]So I want to at least see the end of this level.
[124:29.76]I'll be right back.
[124:38.61]These developers went on to make Cabela's Big Hunt.
[124:42.15]They make all the hunting games?
[124:44.61]What?
[124:47.47]Wow.
[124:53.61]That's pretty cool.
[124:54.19]Alright.
[124:55.31]I had to go to start here.
[124:56.63]See you guys in a few minutes.
[124:58.92]That's really weird.
[126:13.53]so so
[127:40.41]Thank you.
[128:20.13]How we doing?
[128:23.31]How you doing on this fine, fine.
[128:25.07]Was it Thursday?
[128:28.39]Thursday afternoon.
[128:35.31]Nope.
[128:35.59]Hold on.
[128:39.56]I need to put my stuff back where it was.
[128:48.38]Okay.
[128:49.00]We're good.
[128:55.43]It's Wednesday?
[128:59.19]Well, how am I supposed to know if it's Wednesday?
[129:01.47]I don't know.
[129:01.89]How am I supposed to know it's Wednesday?
[129:05.93]I don't know.
[129:06.47]I didn't see that emote in the chat being spammed.
[129:08.95]How am I supposed to know what day it is?
[129:12.87]I thought you guys were better than this.
[129:15.95]Alright.
[129:16.21]Ready?
[129:17.65]Welcome back.
[129:19.85]I was... I have this weird gun.
[129:29.90]He didn't see me.
[129:31.64]I mean, he did see me, but he didn't.
[129:33.30]Oh, come on.
[129:57.66]okay alright so now I have another I'm not and I didn't shoot him last time friend from Mars you don't believe the martian connection theory do you I do not know what I should believe how else could he deprive the big dragon of his city overnight
[130:18.71]And now John Chaser reputedly works for him.
[130:22.26]Chaser?
[130:23.54]But he on other side.
[130:24.76]Does it look like Ant-Man?
[130:25.98]This contradicts the whole theory of Martian connection.
[130:28.59]I'd rather suspect Storm or Thorfinn.
[130:31.27]Chaser...
[130:34.16]Why do you... I thought this was Mike's frequency.
[130:37.18]It was.
[130:37.76]Get out of there.
[130:39.48]The cops will be on top of you any minute.
[130:41.32]Don't force me to use this spider.
[130:43.14]Get out.
[130:44.27]Chaser, you can't leave the building the way you came in.
[130:46.79]I can see people from Ogawa security returning to the building.
[130:50.23]Walter.
[130:52.07]Wait, so why did they not shoot?
[130:55.96]I still have a clear shot.
[130:57.38]If this is my goal, why have I... Walter.
[130:58.96]Oh, Walter.
[130:59.70]Hey, no half measures.
[131:14.02]By the way, I think they gave me a comedy gun.
[131:17.12]I've had five or six guns already this game.
[131:20.20]They don't look like this.
[131:22.18]This is a toy.
[131:22.86]Somebody handed this to me.
[131:24.06]This is not real.
[131:26.34]Oh shit, that's gonna... This is a directional microphone?
[131:31.57]Oh, I thought I was like an assassin.
[131:37.69]I thought I was an assassin.
[131:40.07]I just thought that we were cutting into their room for like, it's a movie and we're cutting in there.
[131:51.49]Shit, I'm not going to live that one down.
[131:53.69]That's a big, that's a bogus, that's a bunch of bogus bullshit, isn't it?
[131:58.47]They probably said microphone too.
[132:00.19]I thought I was trying to shoot this guy.
[132:05.08]So that's why I'm wondering why am I holding a gun up like I'm going to shoot this guy and I don't do anything.
[132:12.44]Where's this other window?
[132:21.57]It's up there with the analog clock, man.
[132:25.23]No, no, not even close.
[132:27.45]Jump out the window.
[132:28.29]I can't jump out the window.
[132:30.02]Look.
[132:31.08]Oh my God.
[132:31.66]Can I go with this one?
[132:35.79]It's a different window.
[132:41.36]I'm stuck in here.
[132:44.04]Not only did I get stuck, I got stuck on the ground.
[132:47.26]Laying down.
[132:48.26]How do you get stuck laying down?
[132:50.02]It gave you good directions.
[132:56.12]But there's a camera.
[133:06.05]I need him to say the directions again.
[133:07.25]Not that door, Chaser.
[133:15.08]Oh my god.
[133:23.73]Wrong door.
[133:40.89]OK, I want I wish I want him to say the directions again.
[133:43.87]It's just right here.
[133:45.27]Oh my God, OK.
[134:12.50]Alright, I did it.
[134:22.41]Where's the cool car?
[134:23.37]I want to be picked up in the Hot Wheels car.
[134:30.30]The hotel.
[134:30.88]Is there like a place to?
[134:39.50]Generate the cut scene or something.
[134:46.50]I would have thought that when you jumped out it would have gone to a cutscene.
[134:52.34]You're going the wrong way.
[135:02.39]I escaped through the window and but didn't I already didn't go in there?
[135:05.73]Yeah, I tried to open this door didn't work.
[135:12.45]Oh fuck this really.
[135:19.06]You saved before the cutscene.
[135:21.24]Wait, what do you mean before the cutscene?
[135:26.82]Wait a minute.
[135:30.81]Wait a minute.
[135:33.07]You mean... I didn't do the microphone thing and it let me escape through the window?
[135:46.51]Why did it let me escape through the window if I couldn't... Oh my god!
[135:52.52]Can I just run up there and... Oh!
[135:56.16]Uh-oh.
[136:00.52]Oh no.
[136:07.11]I remember the painters.
[136:11.20]But he doesn't have directions anymore.
[136:12.80]Oh, this is, this is absolutely fucking cooked.
[136:17.22]This is a, this is a fried egg.
[136:19.24]This is a fried egg.
[136:20.94]This is a fried egg.
[136:25.74]Oh no.
[136:30.66]Are you guys for sure?
[136:31.56]Are you guys, wait, don't I have a hard save somewhere?
[136:37.49]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[136:38.17]Hold on.
[136:39.99]This one might be good.
[136:43.15]Yep, oh thank God OK.
[136:45.65]So now.
[136:47.43]Not here, I gotta go get the cut scene again.
[136:50.47]Thank goodness I hard saved.
[136:52.73]This guy walks by.
[137:01.68]He's so dedicated to this game, OK?
[137:06.18]I mean, it's it's super crunchy, but like I I don't know if you can't leave the building the way you came in.
[137:13.97]I I'm I'm still here.
[137:15.29]I'm still here fake.
[137:18.19]There's an open window in the room next to the bathroom.
[137:20.46]I can see it from here.
[137:22.80]Yep, yep, yep.
[137:27.16]That's right, just underneath it is some scaffolding you can use to climb down.
[137:33.33]That's so funny though that I actually did that and it's even funnier that you can.
[137:37.47]You can do this without the cut scene happening.
[137:51.53]Okay.
[137:59.07]Well, what's wrong with it now?
[138:09.92]Could I have done that before?
[138:27.03]Alright, let's let's keep going.
[138:29.52]I'm into it for a little while.
[138:30.54]I'm not.
[138:31.10]I'm not going anywhere, don't worry.
[138:33.22]What happened to the transmitter?
[138:34.70]I don't know.
[138:36.00]All of a sudden, Valero was on your frequency and told me to get the hell out.
[138:39.77]And just when the Japs were starting to come out with some interesting dirt on him... So it really stinks, eh, Chico?
[138:45.65]Did you pick up any info?
[138:47.27]Yeah.
[138:48.26]Ogawa said that Valero had something to do with some Martian connection.
[138:52.42]Do you know what that is?
[138:53.60]Martian connection?
[138:55.68]A couple of guys believe that the Mars Corps Company, or its president, the Honorable Mr. Longwood,
[139:01.79]YouTube Shorts AI voice.
[139:05.19]...has been funding illegal projects of the company from their profits.
[139:10.11]Illegal projects?
[139:11.57]It's a conspiracy theory.
[139:13.77]There's a rumor that the company has been holding back on the terraformation of Mars so the money can flow into other illegal projects.
[139:21.95]Under the table, Mars Corps is supposedly doing experiments on people, clones, on alterations to the human mind.
[139:28.82]This game is crazy.
[139:29.50]What the hell is wrong with that?
[139:57.26]I'm sorry.
[139:58.14]I just saw a McDonald's sign.
[139:59.20]Can you pull over?
[140:01.65]Dude, we should get it.
[140:02.35]Come on.
[140:02.97]It's been a while.
[140:10.57]Edible kicks.
[140:15.54]I'm just like laughing today.
[140:17.56]Have I even said like a sentence yet?
[140:21.84]Chaser?
[140:24.30]Chaser?
[140:25.04]Did anything happen?
[140:28.41]I don't know.
[140:29.93]I had some visions.
[140:31.77]What do you mean, visions?
[140:33.89]You been doing drugs, Chico?
[140:35.53]If Valero finds out you're using, he'll put you on ice.
[140:38.56]No.
[140:39.36]No, I'm clean.
[140:41.52]The first one happened when they were stuffing this spider in my head.
[140:45.18]I saw a man in black, a commander of some squad before the action.
[140:50.03]I think it was Stone.
[140:51.91]you guys it really is what the fuck I just wanted to tell me about like ancient Egyptians and shit and how like the pyramids were built you know like a million years ago and shit
[141:13.15]And that like dinosaurs have... Pretty good airplane seats.
[141:14.83]Those are nice too.
[141:15.77]Imagine the screens are that big on a plane.
[141:40.91]They probably got hold of the waterworks with the aim of contaminating the source.
[141:45.67]We suspect their goal is to acquire the monopoly for drinking water from icebergs to gain the power over the city that we currently own.
[141:55.59]So we have to strike immediately.
[141:58.31]The waterworks has only one entrance from the north.
[142:02.07]Sanchez and Franklin, you take the sniper rifles and climb up there.
[142:06.79]From there, you'll cover our people.
[142:08.15]Is that fair?
[142:08.57]Yeah, not realistic.
[142:09.31]We all know that if you do that kind of rendering back there, it's going to 4 FPS.
[142:14.65]The aim is the elimination of all radar units and securing of the waterworks area.
[142:19.95]The barrels with the chemicals represent a huge hazard.
[142:23.67]Under no, repeat, under no circumstances can they go in the water.
[142:29.55]Yeah, missing the opening cutscene I think was a huge problem.
[142:31.62]Okay.
[142:49.57]Okay.
[142:50.87]Got it.
[142:51.09]I need a sniper.
[142:51.85]Did I get him?
[143:24.41]How did I am the one that gets killed?
[143:26.06]How am I the one that gets killed?
[143:30.14]Did I shoot myself in the chin or something?
[143:31.82]What was that?
[143:32.38]Okay, I need a sniper rifle.
[143:39.33]Where is a sniper rifle?
[143:40.31]You guys didn't give me one.
[143:55.16]this this guy's smart but where is the I need a rifle this doesn't have a scope on it did you listen yeah he said there's snipers over there and then I started reading chat and somebody said something funny
[144:25.96]I think it's this way.
[144:31.43]Does it run around the building?
[144:37.35]There was an invisible wall back there.
[144:47.46]Why is it letting me go all the way back here?
[144:59.56]Is this stank music?
[145:01.84]Just gotta go to cover.
[145:11.30]Okay, I'm... I'm in cover.
[145:19.81]I thought I was gonna get a sniper rifle and be able to turn around and shoot and turn and shoot.
[145:22.99]I...
[145:31.44]I'm just going to watch this cutscene again.
[145:36.84]Get inside and open the gate.
[145:38.00]Bypass the area and find an alternative way in.
[145:40.90]You're not keeping them busy though.
[145:42.57]No, you're not.
[145:44.51]I can't even walk over here.
[145:47.43]Keep them busy.
[145:48.05]I can't walk that way.
[146:19.11]I can't walk.
[146:20.01]Okay, where am I actually supposed to go?
[146:22.63]Was I actually supposed to go around the whole truck?
[146:24.01]Have you ever played a video game before?
[146:31.88]I wish I could hand you the controller.
[146:37.56]And then watch you do the same thing, and then you would just pull the Ethernet cord out of the back of your computer.
[146:46.67]And you, you're gonna go in here?
[146:48.99]You're gonna go in here.
[146:50.13]You that said that, you're gonna go in here.
[146:52.83]Covering fire!
[146:54.02]You gotta find a way in, we're gonna cover you.
[146:56.36]Go around, go to the subway.
[147:00.70]Huh?
[147:12.65]I thought it was like, we're going to be fighting and shooting.
[147:15.52]I didn't know I had to run around and go across the whole rest of the game.
[147:46.29]Are you mad at us?
[147:47.17]Yes.
[148:02.94]None of these open.
[148:05.37]Why can I even come in here?
[148:07.49]Every single door is locked.
[148:12.61]Okay, it's not this way.
[148:27.11]It was your spirit of adventure.
[148:29.39]True.
[148:30.65]That's true.
[148:39.98]Okay, this is where I came in.
[148:42.80]And it's not down there.
[148:44.70]It's not.
[148:47.60]But I did this already.
[148:48.91]It's not here.
[148:49.85]Every door is locked.
[148:51.89]So up again?
[148:58.11]This one doesn't open at all.
[149:08.51]This one does open.
[149:11.74]Just go all the way up.
[149:13.80]Where's your sense of adventure? ...
[149:32.51]Alright, you gotta give me a little bit of slack here.
[149:35.95]There's an openable door two floors down that you can walk through and then you can try to open every door and it's just a long hallway and there's a door at the end that you can't open as well.
[149:55.49]Blood.
[150:09.19]Alright, let's go.
[150:09.89]Alright, here's the sniper part.
[150:12.41]This is gonna be sick.
[150:14.75]Need a rifle.
[150:15.13]There's gotta be a gun in here, a rifle in here, right?
[150:26.02]I know I can go out there, but no?
[150:27.68]I guess, okay, well, I'm going out.
[150:39.79]This feels wrong, but it's definitely not.
[150:43.55]Oops.
[150:49.55]Oh, fuck.
[150:53.02]Where am I saved?
[150:54.18]Thank goodness.
[151:05.11]I'm stuck to admit.
[151:07.59]Oh, I love this game.
[151:08.85]I like hate this game and love it at the same time.
[151:11.54]It's wonderful.
[151:12.12]OK, I think I found my way in.
[151:40.59]please stream this piece of shit to completion one day I mean I'm I'm playing it right now we're here right now I don't know how long this game is but I'm I'm here I guess pull the big plunger
[152:03.84]No?
[152:06.76]I can't believe you ditched border zone.
[152:10.98]I can.
[152:15.95]I walked around for 30 minutes looking for one guy.
[152:18.43]I was looking for the lieutenant.
[152:21.65]And... Is everything alright?
[152:46.08]You gotta be shitting me.
[152:47.08]Where did I save it?
[152:48.33]Oh my god, you piece of fucking shit.
[152:53.29]What about Half-Life 1?
[153:13.64]I can't shoot through this, but you can.
[153:25.33]I want to, oh, I want to knife somebody.
[153:27.47]That'd be kind of cool, right?
[153:29.13]Let me see if I can knife somebody.
[153:31.59]I'll try to sneak up on someone.
[153:48.98]Armor?
[153:50.60]Nice.
[153:50.92]Beautiful.
[153:52.04]Alright, good.
[153:52.98]Under 100.
[154:14.56]Alright, I got him.
[154:30.23]Why is it more effective than shooting a gun at somebody?
[155:01.83]um why do these guys have high powered super machine weaponry I don't understand what's going on I have a 100 and what the is going on that guy was so deadly oh that's why
[155:37.71]Who's shooting?
[155:47.00]Who is shooting?
[155:49.92]Oh, I see it.
[155:57.01]Where is it?
[155:57.39]Right there.
[156:03.05]Oh, fuck you.
[156:04.23]Oh, my God.
[156:09.26]It's a street light.
[156:13.22]What are you shooting at?
[156:26.52]I can see it!
[156:35.38]Come on, dude.
[156:36.42]What are you talking about?
[156:41.40]It's so stupid.
[156:44.32]That guy wasn't even in the line of sight and he still killed me.
[156:49.65]It does a hundred damage a hit.
[156:51.75]It doesn't matter if you headshot, legshot, toe shot, finger shot.
[156:56.01]Doesn't matter.
[156:56.51]Yeah.
[157:11.75]I wonder where the other one is.
[157:12.78]Oh.
[157:45.41]Got him.
[157:50.16]Oh, fuck you!
[158:03.04]Come on, man!
[158:04.90]Oh, hold on.
[158:18.57]Hold on a second.
[158:19.11]Hold on.
[158:19.47]Hold on.
[158:19.89]Hold on.
[158:20.15]Hold on.
[158:22.25]Okay.
[158:24.71]There's two other people in this room.
[158:27.49]I just punched myself in the balls again, second time in two weeks.
[158:32.41]That is so un- Why do I keep doing that?
[158:34.31]Because you know what?
[158:35.11]I know what's going on.
[158:36.96]Let me explain.
[158:38.84]I am sit- There's no desk in front of me.
[158:41.12]This is actually really funny.
[158:43.88]There's no desk in front of me.
[158:45.84]I'm sitting on a couch.
[158:48.46]On that couch, there is a keyboard on my lap.
[158:52.64]The mouse is on the couch as well with a little mouse pad and a little thing to put my mouse on.
[158:59.77]So because there is no desk, when I get angry and I put my hands up and I smash down on what would be a desk, I'm smashing down on my ball sack.
[159:09.85]Because there's no desk here to be angry.
[159:11.75]Oh my god, I can't believe it.
[159:13.21]That's the second time this has happened in two weeks.
[159:17.24]I'm not messing around.
[159:18.22]I actually did this twice.
[159:20.64]Instead of... Oh, no.
[159:21.97]And I'm not hitting that hard.
[159:23.07]It's very light.
[159:24.39]But you know that, like... Ah, dang it.
[159:26.35]I... Damn it.
[159:27.59]I'm going down as if there's a desk here and it's just hitting me directly in the penis.
[159:33.31]And this is an issue.
[159:34.57]I think I'm going to have to start to wear a cup.
[159:43.17]Ow.
[159:44.77]Ow.
[159:50.64]One day, maybe I'll have a cam on and I need to full cam it because then you guys would be able to see and that would be really weird looking.
[159:59.40]What a weird image that would be because it's happened twice.
[160:01.78]Oh, that's so funny because it's real and I wish I was making it up, but I'm just not.
[160:16.72]It's because I typically would hit my hands down in that spot.
[160:21.16]Remember, I've been doing this for 15 years.
[160:24.44]Right forward down where the keyboard is behind the space bar is like, oh, damn it.
[160:28.50]I put my fist down.
[160:30.85]You can't unlearn that.
[160:31.99]It's been 15 years, guys.
[160:33.49]It's been a long time.
[160:37.79]It's going to take me a little while of sitting on the couch for like a few months.
[160:43.63]Okay, this guy's dead.
[160:49.22]Oh, that's so dumb.
[160:59.14]It's unbelievable that guy can kill me that quickly.
[161:10.43]Yeah, night where through through the through the wall.
[161:23.13]I can see ya What the fuck I can see ya
[162:01.15]What?
[162:02.03]What are you doing?
[162:03.17]A lot of people are laughing and I get it.
[162:06.81]It's funny.
[162:07.81]It's pretty funny.
[162:08.71]I understand.
[162:09.78]But how?
[162:10.30]You explain that one to me.
[162:14.64]Explain that one to me.
[162:16.88]That's why I've been going crazy like this.
[162:28.59]Oh my.
[162:29.15]Do I have any grenades?
[162:36.37]You can slow down time?
[162:40.83]You can slow down... wait, is that the thing... what is it called?
[162:45.83]Adrenaline mode.
[162:48.41]Guys, don't tell me that I've been able to do adrenaline mode this whole time.
[162:54.49]You've... you... I'm supposed to be using adrenaline mode.
[163:05.05]It's so slow.
[163:13.61]That is a detriment.
[163:15.49]That's not helpful.
[163:35.53]Where is he?
[163:47.57]That guy's gun is bleeding.
[163:56.90]Ah!
[163:57.62]What the?
[163:58.32]There's another person here!
[164:05.07]Okay.
[164:08.01]That's, uh... Adrenaline mode.
[164:13.27]I'm really glad I... I'm really glad you told me that.
[164:15.38]Because I was... There was no way I was going to be able to do this.
[164:23.82]Nobody told me I had... In the very beginning of the game, I swear if that opening cutscene talks about, he was injected with a serum that made him able to slow down time by pressing a certain key...
[164:38.19]This guy is pissing me off.
[165:01.45]They keep spawning.
[165:02.71]I don't think they're actually here.
[165:03.89]I think they're actually spawning into the game.
[165:12.99]It tells you really early on.
[165:14.65]That's what I mean.
[165:15.23]I probably just didn't see that.
[165:16.77]If that opening cutscene probably talked about it.
[165:24.70]If that's the case, that's really funny.
[165:37.25]I guess it is kind of helpful.
[165:42.75]Have you ever done cocaine?
[165:44.23]No.
[165:46.07]And I don't plan on ever.
[165:46.93]I feel like this is wrong, but I'm going this way.
[166:01.21]Alright, first thing I see in the chat, that is an edible food and not somebody saying...
[166:30.42]I got him.
[166:42.21]I was trying to duck from the fire.
[167:03.50]I can't believe this is a slow down the game mechanic.
[167:06.48]Is somebody falling?
[167:19.50]I have to say, there's a sniper in there, by the way.
[167:22.46]I got to turn adrenaline mode on.
[167:25.54]We got to go open up.
[167:26.72]Boom.
[167:27.02]Adrenaline.
[167:28.05]Open.
[167:28.31]Go.
[167:33.27]Who's left?
[167:33.65]Anybody else?
[167:40.51]Oh, his head is gone.
[167:41.63]Oh.
[167:46.82]I just freaked out.
[167:47.66]That's why I can't play first person.
[167:50.38]That's why I can't play first person shooters.
[167:53.17]Playing, oh, why don't you play Valorant?
[167:54.93]What I just did right there is why.
[167:57.37]No, fuck that.
[167:58.31]I'm not playing that.
[168:00.89]Switching to my knife or something would take me 15 seconds.
[168:03.95]I don't want to play Valorant anyways.
[168:10.69]Anyways.
[168:18.92]Oh my god, there's so many people here.
[168:29.60]I swear they are being spawned in.
[168:32.38]I'm telling you, they're spawning in.
[168:46.35]Can't jump it.
[169:00.69]next game no no way not not not yet I'm locked in on this one
[169:56.28]I need help.
[170:01.99]Thank you.
[170:03.73]Okay.
[170:06.85]Can't jump down.
[170:16.89]Isn't this just worse?
[170:18.11]Trey Pang 2.
[170:20.34]Well, you have to give a little bit of credit here.
[170:22.24]Riff Hang 2 did come out about 20 to 30 years later.
[170:27.16]No, no, no.
[170:44.01]This is Chaser.
[170:47.02]Different game.
[170:52.18]There's a health pack over there, I think.
[170:58.19]You're asking about food earlier.
[170:59.99]Oh, um... Yeah, what's something I should eat today?
[171:04.71]What do you think?
[171:09.41]Holly and I got to figure out what we want to eat.
[171:11.55]Whether it's making something later or going out and getting something.
[171:15.63]I don't know.
[171:15.95]What do you think?
[171:17.89]Any suggestions?
[171:24.75]I saw somebody say lasagna, and that's actually kind of a good idea.
[171:41.86]Fajitas?
[171:43.44]Ooh, that sounds good too.
[171:49.98]Frog pot lasagna is really good.
[172:02.81]Tacos.
[172:05.09]Taco sounds good too.
[172:12.18]Honey, are you in?
[172:13.50]Are you here?
[172:13.96]You want to tacos?
[172:26.25]Maybe.
[172:28.15]Sounds kind of good.
[172:28.67]See that reaction time by the way.
[172:32.85]That's a Valorant player.
[172:35.42]I still got it sometimes.
[172:43.16]That was a whip reaction.
[172:44.70]That was a flick reaction.
[172:46.22]Counter-Strike style.
[172:51.97]That was a bronze type reaction.
[172:53.27]That's still a metal.
[172:55.07]You forget that.
[173:02.90]I can't believe you can't believe you got a metal.
[173:04.64]I can't believe you've got a metal Oh, no, I got a fucking metal some of you guys seriously don't get it What you say
[173:24.42]Imagine getting pure bronze.
[173:26.56]That shiny, wonderful copper looking material.
[173:32.01]It's got that nice sheen on it.
[173:35.97]It's dense.
[173:37.59]It's a little bit darker and it's heavier.
[173:39.61]Gotta save.
[173:54.14]Gold is fine.
[173:55.02]Gold's a little overrated, I think.
[173:57.52]Do you have a nice piece of wood?
[174:01.96]A nice piece of wood.
[174:04.56]Beautiful.
[174:08.93]I should make a quiche.
[174:11.81]If I had a little bit more culinary skills, I would agree with you.
[174:17.73]That's not going to happen.
[174:20.72]I would make a quiche and it would be a soup.
[174:26.02]You got a wood metal.
[174:27.72]Now I like.
[174:28.38]Just wait till you get to be over 30 years old.
[174:32.66]When you turn 35, wood is actually kind of really well.
[174:35.92]Actually, it's kind of sick.
[174:43.79]Exhaled sounds kind of good too.
[174:46.65]That does sound good.
[174:54.38]How come nobody ever made compilations, you know, and like frag compilations?
[175:00.10]I want a frag compilation of enemies, just NPCs like this.
[175:03.87]How come nobody ever did that?
[175:05.85]I feel like that'd be really funny.
[175:09.51]To music and shit, it's not against players, it's in a single player game.
[175:18.22]Because that's easy, but that's funny.
[175:20.14]I think that'd be really funny.
[175:23.80]It's too easy.
[175:24.40]It's too easy.
[175:25.74]Right, but if you titled the video like, you know, 100 frags, you know, 50 to 1 KD, whatever.
[175:33.55]And it was just you in a single player game running around doing this and it just cut all the times that you got killed.
[175:47.48]You put music on it.
[175:53.03]I should make one right now.
[175:57.34]Alright, so whoever's editing this video... Whoever's editing this video... At the end of this video, you should do a... Have like a rock song from the mid-2000s.
[176:10.75]And show a big compilation of me getting kills and... Even if I miss a shitload of times too.
[176:15.57]Put it to Linkin Park, yeah.
[176:20.31]Where am I?
[176:20.57]Where did I go?
[176:23.87]Yeah.
[176:24.29]Yeah.
[176:25.07]That would be a good part of that.
[176:38.50]Stop it.
[176:53.27]Yeah, it's gotta be a song that has, you know... It's gonna be one of those... One of those songs.
[177:02.29]It's gotta be one of those.
[177:21.58]Creed, yeah.
[177:35.70]That steam didn't hurt.
[177:55.83]And then... Oh, it was funny.
[178:36.02]That video would have 15 views, by the way.
[178:39.14]I would hope that if it was on my channel that it would as well.
[178:42.08]Like it would get 15 views.
[178:43.74]In fact, I would like unlist the video.
[178:46.47]Make sure that I clicked on the video 15 times.
[178:50.51]And then we watched it on stream.
[178:52.83]Do you know what I mean?
[178:54.59]Make sure that it has less than 100 views.
[179:11.78]I have to be very honest.
[179:12.70]I have absolutely no idea.
[179:16.38]I've just been walking in a straight line and opening doors that I see.
[179:20.04]And I think I've somehow made progress.
[179:24.06]But I'm kind of stuck now.
[179:29.34]Yeah, dude, you're crashing out right now.
[179:35.71]No, what?
[179:38.01]Why am I crashing out right now?
[179:39.43]What did I do?
[179:53.68]Okay, but honestly, where do I go?
[179:56.92]That door doesn't open?
[179:58.82]I can't jump over this.
[180:01.11]Oh, come on, it's right there.
[180:03.79]Come on, go ahead.
[180:26.11]Crashing out.
[180:26.87]I'm not doing anything.
[180:29.89]You're crashing out.
[180:34.68]No, no, I can't.
[180:35.40]It's not fair.
[180:35.68]It's not fair.
[180:38.68]That's not fair.
[180:41.76]That's a BM.
[180:47.16]It's been a while.
[180:51.82]Then you gotta get the knife out and... Oh, that was a good clip.
[180:56.68]That'll be a good one.
[180:57.42]Can you do a 360 no scope?
[181:15.47]Uh, yeah, I think so.
[181:18.36]Yeah, I think I could do it.
[181:20.72]Okay.
[181:33.03]You don't see buttons like this anymore.
[181:34.67]And I know exactly how these look and I know exactly how they feel when you press them.
[181:40.52]These are the... In most places that have a fun technological toy, these are here to be pressed.
[181:51.54]And they don't do anything.
[181:52.92]But it's encouraged that you press them.
[182:02.01]Can I not actually touch this?
[182:04.91]Chuck E. Cheese buttons?
[182:06.45]Yeah.
[182:10.99]We got buttons like these everywhere.
[182:12.13]I work at a TV station.
[182:15.82]It's crashing out right now.
[182:18.34]Do you guys catch that?
[182:40.38]Did you say I'm bleeding?
[182:41.40]I think I got him.
[183:04.58]That was a tough pull.
[183:34.41]That was a tough pull.
[183:38.30]I aggroed three of them.
[183:39.32]Alright.
[183:39.62]I'm going to take a break.
[184:00.33]I'll be right back.
[184:00.89]A few minutes.
[184:05.33]This game is getting good.
[184:14.27]He's going to take a crash outbreak.
[184:16.67]Yeah, I'm just going to take a quick crash outbreak.
[184:29.47]Alright, see you guys in a few minutes.
[184:32.29]Ads will start in about 20 seconds.
[184:34.31]Get up and stretch, move around.
[184:35.53]I will be doing the same.
[184:40.60]See you very soon.
[185:25.30]Thank you.
[187:41.89]Thank you.
[189:10.99]I got a T. That's how you know we just got dead serious.
[189:21.62]That's how you know it just got dead serious.
[189:35.85]Oh, man.
[189:36.65]Okay.
[189:45.18]Got to let it steep.
[189:50.46]How many teas have I had today?
[189:51.84]This would be the first one.
[189:58.24]Maybe one more.
[189:59.77]Early this morning.
[190:03.37]So I've obviously been a coffee addict for a very long time.
[190:07.25]I was a two or three at least coffee a day kind of guy.
[190:11.91]And now I'm trying to do one.
[190:16.32]one coffee in the morning and then a couple of teas during the day.
[190:20.64]And I think it's been going pretty well.
[190:28.69]Sometimes I have a couple of coffees and it just, whatever.
[190:32.07]It's the way it is.
[190:40.79]You drink weed tea?
[190:42.79]No, it's rooibos, peppermint and ginger.
[190:47.64]Not in that order and not at the same time.
[190:53.23]Cool.
[190:55.39]Alright.
[190:56.03]We are good to go.
[191:12.27]How's the game?
[191:12.81]Okay, is the game loud?
[191:13.73]Should I turn the game down?
[191:14.65]How do you guys feel?
[191:16.47]Feel good?
[191:17.81]Is it perfect?
[191:18.27]Is it just enough crust?
[191:19.67]Just enough loudness?
[191:22.51]Good?
[191:25.05]A little loud?
[191:25.49]A tad loud?
[191:27.49]Fine?
[191:27.77]How about I... I'll drop it by another... How's that?
[191:40.24]Better?
[191:40.86]Just a tad.
[191:44.25]That's better.
[191:45.25]Just a tad.
[191:49.88]Alright, I like this one.
[191:52.46]I'm a fan of this one.
[191:53.42]I'm going to keep playing this one, but I do want to play some of the other weird shit that I have planned for today.
[192:00.31]This was a kind of a weird one, but I know this one was.
[192:02.99]I don't know how long this game is.
[192:05.21]It's a couple other things I'd like to do today.
[192:14.69]And I plan on being live for another few hours.
[192:19.49]So I'd like to get through some other stuff.
[192:24.60]But I can't seem to go away from this one.
[192:41.84]10 to 15 hours.
[192:42.62]Damn, that's long for a game like this.
[192:45.57]This long ago, too.
[192:46.45]Yeah.
[192:49.43]Alright, here we go.
[192:56.11]I think they've been just shooting each other the whole time.
[193:04.96]Oh, right.
[193:05.72]It's supposed to be helping them and clearing this out, right?
[193:12.62]I wonder if there are boss fights in this game.
[193:14.18]Probably not.
[193:24.43]Great.
[193:36.79]Old FPS games used to be long, too long.
[193:48.38]I have a story for everybody, by the way.
[193:51.62]I wanted to tell this on stream.
[193:56.42]I think some of you will enjoy it.
[194:03.75]So, at the grocery store, you know how you have the cart?
[194:09.78]You walk around with the cart.
[194:11.26]Let's pause it because I want to make sure you get this whole thing.
[194:14.83]So at the grocery store, you have a cart and you walk around with it.
[194:17.50]You put stuff in it and there are aisles at the grocery store.
[194:20.67]And then there is the outside area outside of the aisles and
[194:26.57]it's kind of hard to see if you have the cart and you're pushing the cart and when you come out of one of the aisles there might be somebody to the left or to the right it's kind of hard to see it so you need to get inch a little is somebody coming oh okay somebody is coming and what happens sometimes is you both are moving at the same time and whoa hold on sorry
[194:50.95]So that happened.
[194:52.27]It was just some lady and it was like, oh, look out for the traffic jams.
[194:57.45]Yeah, be careful of traffic.
[195:00.03]I say that.
[195:01.31]I do that pretty much every time that happens.
[195:03.58]It's a way to just be like, oh, whatever.
[195:05.44]Oh, look out for the grocery store traffic.
[195:07.92]And I kind of looked over to my peripheral and I saw another lady who saw that altercation and was like, oh, didn't really like say anything about it.
[195:18.92]Just kind of like, oh, okay.
[195:19.96]Like you saw that.
[195:22.20]Fast forward about 25 minutes, a different person.
[195:26.64]I did it again.
[195:28.48]And I did the same line.
[195:31.03]I did the, oh, look out, traffic, traffic coming through.
[195:35.61]And the person that saw it the first time happened to be there again a second time.
[195:43.63]And it didn't say anything.
[195:47.60]Nobody said anything.
[195:48.64]It was just like, oh, okay, you saw that.
[195:50.96]I didn't even address it.
[195:52.16]This was not a problem at all.
[195:54.64]So a third time, it was about to happen.
[195:57.83]And I made sure that I wasn't going to use that line.
[196:05.44]And it was just like, oh, yeah, sorry, yeah.
[196:08.70]And did I look like a dick and didn't do my quintessential patented line of, look out for the traffic, grocery store traffic jam.
[196:16.60]And did that person think that I was a dick?
[196:18.46]Because I was so afraid of another person seeing me do that for a third time.
[196:23.44]So I just didn't do it.
[196:24.87]I just kind of was like, oh, yeah, sorry about that.
[196:34.53]cycling through your NPC dialog.
[196:38.73]Yeah, but here's the thing, we all have a couple of NPC dialogues that we pull out to strangers.
[196:46.03]And you really don't want people to know that that's your NPC dialog.
[196:52.92]So being kind of caught using one of your five NPC lines is like, oh, that's yours, huh?
[196:59.70]You're the lookout for the traffic.
[197:02.60]Grocery store traffic jam.
[197:05.10]And I've realized I say that all the fucking time.
[197:09.30]It almost every time that happens, I kind of look up, I perk up a little bit.
[197:13.38]I say, look out for the traffic.
[197:15.38]And now I'm afraid to do it again.
[197:16.96]I have to, I got to get some new lines.
[197:18.34]I got to get another line.
[197:24.68]I just figured you guys think that was funny.
[197:37.87]but it's like doing that a second time and being aware that somebody may have heard you do it already and then maybe a third time too yeah nobody wants to see well you you gotta you gotta save those NPC lines you're such an over thinker yeah welcome to my world
[198:19.58]I'm taking your shopping NPC line.
[198:23.53]No, don't do that, because if you guys start doing that, if you guys start to say that, then if I say it again, then I'm doing like a trend.
[198:35.34]No, that's my shit.
[198:38.52]The... grocery store traffic!
[198:40.30]Be careful!
[198:40.88]Oh, traffic jam!
[198:41.80]Don't... that's not yours.
[198:42.84]That's mine.
[198:44.24]You come up with some of the dumb bullshit.
[198:45.78]Don't take mine.
[198:49.06]Why... why could I come up here?
[199:00.30]This is a Half-Life level.
[199:04.93]Except I am so much more confused.
[199:06.99]Am I going the wrong way?
[199:12.62]Turn the music down.
[199:13.94]You guys are sick of the music, no?
[199:16.16]That didn't do anything.
[199:23.78]That's not your line.
[199:24.86]I used it last week.
[199:40.55]I was already, wait, I shouldn't be doing this.
[199:43.63]Wait, where do I go?
[199:53.03]Do you pretend to honk the cart too?
[199:54.79]No, because that's weird.
[199:55.73]That's a weird guy thing to do.
[199:57.75]That's weird.
[199:59.63]If I was like, oh, look out for the traffic.
[200:01.45]Traffic jam.
[200:02.37]Honk, honk.
[200:03.55]No, it's like, you had me for a second.
[200:06.35]Now I don't want to fucking get away from me.
[200:10.08]The first part is fine.
[200:11.74]There's nothing wrong with the first part.
[200:13.22]It's cordial.
[200:14.50]It's friendly.
[200:15.42]It's, hey, whoopsie daisy, right?
[200:17.60]Now, adding that is you're a weird guy now.
[200:19.51]Don't do that.
[200:20.15]That's a weirdo fucking thing to do.
[200:21.45]Do I have to press one of these?
[200:28.29]Now, beep beep is also weird.
[200:29.93]Don't add a sound effect.
[200:31.43]People are going to think you're a weird person.
[200:33.47]I feel like I have to touch something or push something.
[200:42.80]It's trying too hard.
[200:43.60]Yeah, no, it is.
[200:48.70]You're already trying too hard by saying anything more than... Excuse me.
[200:55.83]That's already trying too hard.
[201:01.07]It's... That... You're already... I've already... Trust me.
[201:05.13]The, like, disarming a situation that is not a situation... Is already what's going on.
[201:19.41]How do I get in here?
[201:24.35]Oh, fuck you.
[201:25.25]Where's the save?
[201:25.95]Actually, probably in a better spot.
[201:32.76]Wait, what?
[201:36.28]Alright, I think I'm gonna move on.
[201:38.80]This one was fun, and I... It was bizarre, and it was fucking a little weird, but you know, whatever.
[201:45.18]We can, uh... We can go to the next one.
[201:50.94]Mmm, hold on.
[201:55.48]What is this?
[201:57.39]I think I just found it.
[201:58.93]I got it.
[202:02.19]You just you have to just threaten that you're going to quit the game and then it will make you progress.
[202:36.78]Okay.
[202:37.20]Ooh, I like this.
[202:48.21]Play a new game?
[202:49.77]Hey, I will play a new game when I'm ready to play a new game.
[202:52.97]I'm not ready to play a new game, so I'm not going to play a new game.
[202:56.74]I'm still enjoying what I'm doing.
[203:12.68]He's tough but fair.
[203:23.23]No?
[203:32.64]Well, I got a wrestling game to play.
[203:33.84]So I'm sure a lot of you would be happy about that.
[203:46.85]You lost 60... 60 something?
[203:48.73]60 health?
[203:50.07]Oh, shit.
[203:51.26]And I just pressed... F6 whilst... Oh, here we go.
[203:54.34]Nice.
[203:54.58]Are they poisoning the water supply?
[204:14.75]So drop them into the water, what?
[204:50.66]wrong way.
[204:56.80]Look at his back turn.
[204:57.96]Uh oh, that's not good.
[205:08.75]Yeah, he ran in front of friendly fire.
[205:12.29]Damn.
[205:13.45]The water's been poisoned.
[205:14.45]This fucking car.
[205:32.47]Now what?
[206:05.65]This is a TikTok video.
[206:06.85]This is a TikTok video editing.
[206:57.57]I think I'm good.
[207:02.38]Good news.
[207:05.42]If you do this every morning, this one thing in the morning, doctors will tell you not to do it.
[207:09.45]But a spoonful of this one substance will clear out your digestive tract.
[207:12.99]Hmm.
[207:16.23]What's the hook?
[207:17.62]Yakuza is holding her in the underground where she performs various improvements.
[207:21.78]This superfood has been around for 2000 years.
[207:25.78]You'll have to be damn good and lucky.
[207:27.98]Click the link below to see what major superfood you could be ingesting.
[207:32.91]One spoonful.
[207:37.07]We're here, Chico.
[207:38.15]The main entrance can't be used.
[207:39.89]Try one of the abandoned entries to the sewer.
[207:42.65]This will be useful for you.
[207:44.54]And watch out for yourself.
[207:47.47]But now it's all AI.
[207:48.35]Now it's like an AI lady that she's moving around a lot.
[207:52.60]She's moving around a lot and her mouth is moving weirdly.
[207:55.08]It's like she looks like she's being puppeteered.
[207:56.92]This one trick that I found.
[207:59.74]It was very crazy.
[208:01.08]When I woke up in the morning, I swear.
[208:02.72]And all her arms are moving and her face is moving and her head is moving.
[208:05.67]I swear it's the best I've ever felt in my whole life.
[208:07.55]I woke up this one trick.
[208:09.75]Try now.
[208:19.60]Alright, this game was very fun.
[208:21.22]Very good.
[208:21.70]I'm going to get the claps.
[208:23.28]This gets a double clap.
[208:25.04]But I do want to play a couple of things.
[208:28.22]I want to play the wrestling game that I have.
[208:31.38]I want to play.
[208:33.67]There's quite a few things I want to play.
[208:48.43]Very good.
[208:48.81]Alright.
[208:49.89]The next one.
[208:50.45]Uh, let's, okay.
[208:52.01]Do you want to see the wrestling one?
[208:54.19]It looks pretty good.
[208:54.87]It looks fun.
[208:57.79]I'm definitely into it.
[209:02.38]Although I'm hopefully can do it with a keyboard.
[209:05.00]It might be really, I mapped it to a controller, but the control was not plugged in anymore.
[209:09.90]And, uh, I think I'm going to have to do keyboard, but that's fine.
[209:16.62]That was Chaser.
[209:18.66]Did not expect to play that for two and a half hours, but I enjoyed it very much.
[209:25.36]This game is called Three Count Bout.
[209:32.51]Let's see.
[209:36.03]Very bright.
[209:42.25]Alright.
[209:44.35]Now here's the question.
[209:50.33]I go into the options and I go into keyboard.
[209:58.99]Okay.
[209:59.99]Up, down, left, right.
[210:01.30]That's how you do that.
[210:06.34]Music's pretty good.
[210:06.90]Alright.
[210:08.52]Button A is seven.
[210:09.82]No, no, no, no, it is not.
[210:12.49]We'll do button A is A. What the hell is that?
[210:22.84]Okay, A will do... B button will be S. C button will be D. And then F for D button.
[210:38.46]A and B will be U. Oh boy.
[210:41.28]How about space?
[210:44.17]B and C will be... Use the numpad.
[210:48.87]I have a shortened keyboard.
[210:50.17]I don't have a numpad.
[210:58.24]And then we'll make this B. And then we'll make this G. I'm just going to be spamming anyways, guys.
[211:08.30]What is this combination?
[211:09.46]I guess P, H, continuous K. Alright.
[211:14.13]So it's just all these buttons in this vicinity.
[211:17.45]Got it.
[211:17.79]Okay.
[211:19.87]So now... Let's go.
[211:30.98]Alright, who should I play as?
[211:34.30]Terry Rogers.
[211:38.88]I kind of like Leo.
[211:44.27]Go Jack Big Bomb?
[211:51.39]Blubberman?
[211:52.25]Okay, I apparently have picked Blubberman.
[211:54.36]I ran out of time.
[212:01.07]Okay.
[212:12.72]Alright.
[212:13.82]SNK Wrestling Federation versus... I wish they came out like this.
[212:27.00]That Super Nintendo sound effect.
[212:31.69]Let's go.
[212:35.15]Oh, that's jump?
[212:40.36]Here comes a new player?
[212:41.66]Wait, what?
[212:42.16]Wait, what do you mean new player?
[212:49.54]Did I press the... What did I do?
[213:08.77]I think I may have accidentally logged in with another person.
[213:15.08]Holy shit, what?
[213:20.82]I'm breaking his back.
[213:37.90]Are you fighting yourself?
[213:40.30]No, no, no.
[213:40.70]I'm just trying to get the buttons done.
[213:42.73]This is practice.
[213:45.35]So it looks like this A is a very regular attack.
[213:48.45]Is there a throw?
[213:49.11]I can do like a backflip.
[213:53.24]Holy shit.
[213:58.74]Yeah, this is my training.
[213:59.88]I'm just trying to train.
[214:02.24]So this is punch, this is kick.
[214:04.41]And that's jump.
[214:06.05]And that's another jump.
[214:06.97]So it's just punch, kick, jump.
[214:08.53]How do you grab?
[214:09.13]Okay, when you grab... Joystick and the power buttons.
[214:13.79]Alright, so you have to ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta when you get in somebody.
[214:22.72]So you walk in and then go...
[214:27.11]Yep.
[214:27.33]So you have to just hold the direction.
[214:31.05]Alright, I get it.
[214:44.81]Master Barnes?
[214:48.46]Alright, I kind of want to be the... Which one?
[214:50.82]Alright, I'm going to be Master Barnes.
[214:59.77]Alright, here we go.
[215:11.41]I can go outside and probably smash him to the table.
[215:17.86]Alright, this time I'm not going to have player two join.
[215:23.22]I'm going to kick the shit out of this guy.
[215:30.15]There we go.
[215:32.99]Ooh, I can do a spam kick.
[215:43.05]I want to go outside.
[216:00.73]What the fuck just happened to me?
[216:02.03]Alright, I'm going outside.
[216:05.03]How do I leave the ring?
[216:18.36]Jeremy, you're a dude.
[216:19.40]No, my God.
[216:20.58]Damn it.
[216:20.98]Okay.
[216:22.02]It's because I pressed W.
[216:32.76]I can't... I gotta unbound... I gotta unbind W. Hold on.
[216:39.65]Keyboard.
[216:40.55]Okay.
[216:41.13]Yeah, like, if I press P, it's gonna... Can I just unbind everything?
[216:49.40]Okay, clear.
[216:50.08]How do I clear it?
[216:58.88]This is a pretty fast crash out.
[217:01.94]I need a controller and I don't have a plugged in, so I'm just quitting.
[217:06.15]I give up.
[217:06.95]I quit.
[217:07.55]This one was cool.
[217:08.99]But I need my controller.
[217:10.41]It's too hard to play on a keyboard.
[217:14.83]I didn't rage quit.
[217:15.79]I controller quit.
[217:21.03]This one.
[217:22.97]This one's going to need a lot of help with this one.
[217:26.42]But I feel like this one's going to be here for a couple hours.
[217:29.69]This one's called Buccaneer.
[217:31.67]It's a pirate game.
[217:40.55]Does it go get it?
[217:41.42]Maybe I will later on a break.
[217:49.82]Ow.
[217:58.26]Imagine getting announced with trumpets.
[218:14.86]This game is good.
[218:15.60]I've seen a lot of 10 out of 10s already.
[218:20.66]I was excited about this when I saw it.
[218:25.38]Is that the SpongeBob pirate?
[218:33.83]alright I'm ready we need to slowly we're going to learn how to okay single player campaign
[218:53.11]Okay, the campaign.
[218:54.35]A brother lost.
[218:56.66]Serve Rodney's ruin.
[218:59.14]For love.
[219:00.40]Family's name.
[219:01.44]Revenge and rescue.
[219:02.58]A quest for treasure.
[219:04.02]This is so loud.
[219:04.78]Hold on, I need to turn it down.
[219:16.95]How can I turn this down from here?
[219:19.25]Okay, I'm going to have to hit this.
[219:22.47]Hold on.
[219:23.47]Hold on, give me, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[219:24.79]I'm going to crash my computer if I'm not careful.
[219:29.43]Hold on.
[219:31.33]Give me one second.
[219:34.77]That's the dev team, by the way.
[219:36.67]That's so cute.
[219:37.49]I love that.
[219:38.13]I love that.
[219:39.39]Okay, hold on a second.
[219:43.93]I can't really draw.
[219:45.19]There we go.
[219:45.59]That should be good now.
[219:52.23]Better?
[219:55.70]I think it's much better.
[219:56.38]Oh yeah, you can actually hear now.
[220:06.70]Alright, so campaign.
[220:20.17]I kind of want to do serve Rodney's ruin.
[220:25.60]Or a quest for treasure.
[220:26.76]Which one?
[220:34.94]Top left is just you.
[220:36.88]No, it is not.
[220:37.63]Not even close.
[220:38.29]Alright, quest for treasure.
[220:40.99]Smooth sailing, wind and waves, or batting down the hatches.
[220:45.35]This is just easy, normal, or hard.
[220:47.31]And I don't know which one of these I... Should I do hard?
[220:49.01]You're going to have to help me with this one.
[220:56.42]I mean, that's absolutely the flag.
[220:59.91]Your name.
[221:00.67]Anonymous.
[221:08.80]I can't even type that much.
[221:13.21]How about Old Captain?
[221:22.24]The captain was on her father's ship, bound for Italy, when it was taken by Barbary pirates.
[221:27.56]Her father was mortally wounded in the fight.
[221:29.66]It's a little low.
[221:31.10]He gave her a piece of treasure map and told her if she ever got to the Caribbean, she was to seek out her cousin, who has the other half of the map.
[221:39.11]With a sigh, he died with the word grace on his lips.
[221:42.55]The pirates set sail for Morocco, but before the ship could reach shore, fever struck.
[221:47.63]The captain took some men's clothes and escaped using an empty barrel as a float.
[221:52.31]After many adventures disguised as a man, she arrived in the Caribbean and was made captain of this ship.
[221:58.85]We found out that she was a woman, but we stay loyal to her, for she's fearless and brave, and she'll find us adventure and riches aplenty.
[222:06.24]The map says to look for an innkeeper by the name of Jacques Piquet, so we're off to the nearest pirate hideout, for surely the innkeeper there will know the names of his brothers whereabouts.
[222:16.22]Raise the sails, for we're away, mes amis.
[222:18.86]Okay, the map says to look for an innkeeper by the name of Jacques Piquet.
[222:23.18]So we're off to the nearest pirate, I doubt, for surely the innkeeper.
[222:27.61]Okay, so the nearest pirate hideout.
[222:33.49]That music just scared the shit out of me.
[222:35.13]Okay.
[222:37.45]Victories.
[222:39.59]Missions.
[222:47.12]Okay, I got 1600 gold, 600 supplies, 40 ale, and 40 cheese.
[223:00.44]Boat's doing fine.
[223:03.17]I got 250 cannonballs, 10 cannons, 100% on the sails, and I have 11 crew.
[223:08.49]And that's me.
[223:13.39]Okay, I think these are rivals.
[223:17.74]Alright, so where do I want to go?
[223:22.02]The nearest pirate hideout.
[223:34.51]How about just down here?
[223:37.53]Ship Ahoy.
[223:38.21]Okay, it's a British ship.
[223:41.57]Approach the ship.
[223:42.25]Should we evade or approach?
[223:44.97]Let's approach.
[223:47.27]Oh shit.
[223:47.97]Okay.
[223:48.57]Um, how do you, how do you drive the boat?
[224:01.89]Is this, am I doing it?
[224:14.80]All the way down, right?
[224:22.72]Is there anything else I can do besides just drive straight out?
[224:26.48]Oh wait, I think they're turning around.
[224:42.44]How do I shoot the cannons?
[224:45.11]There's no more wind!
[225:03.31]Well, yeah, I can... that's fine.
[225:05.27]Alright.
[225:05.85]I want to go down here.
[225:06.99]I want to keep going.
[225:10.23]Okay, this is two ships.
[225:11.21]These are two British ships.
[225:13.12]Approach.
[225:14.96]Here we go.
[225:15.78]Full sail.
[225:16.36]Get over there.
[225:18.50]Maybe we can trade.
[225:21.35]I've got spices.
[225:23.14]I've got... Okay, hold on.
[225:24.26]Are they going to talk to me?
[225:30.28]You want to talk?
[225:32.54]How come I'm not going anymore?
[225:40.68]Oh, here we go.
[225:41.26]Alright.
[225:42.28]How do I... What was that?
[225:43.94]Oh, they're shooting at us.
[225:46.78]They're shooting at us.
[225:50.55]Somebody... Wait.
[225:54.59]Are we alright?
[225:56.01]Do we... I wanted to trade.
[226:07.00]You're a pirate.
[226:08.46]Yeah, pirates can't trade?
[226:14.35]starboard cannon ready what starboard cannon ready okay maybe I should learn hold on a second is there is there a controls I have not approached evade
[226:36.42]No, evade.
[226:37.48]We know how this works.
[226:39.63]Evade.
[226:39.97]I just want to get to town.
[226:44.23]What?
[226:49.85]Wait, I can attack the town?
[226:51.32]Okay.
[226:54.24]I don't think a crew dying of scurvy should attack the town.
[226:58.16]But... I kind of want to see...
[227:06.33]Who's who?
[227:09.53]The captain is kicking the shit out of everybody.
[227:13.97]Am I going to kill the whole town by myself as just the captain?
[227:16.75]Oh, the captain's dead.
[227:28.66]The captain was killed and never found the treasure she had searched for.
[227:41.88]uh hold on a second here we're gonna do uh wind and waves we're not doing hard the captain was on our father's ship so don't don't don't attack the town avoid people I got the same crew let's try this again
[228:11.54]I want to go.
[228:11.86]Let's go to that town.
[228:12.72]I want to go up here.
[228:13.22]OK, enter town.
[228:22.52]Tavern.
[228:26.52]Talk to the innkeeper.
[228:29.05]The innkeeper was in a talkative mood.
[228:31.49]He sat with the captain and told her that he had heard of an innkeeper called Jacques Piquet.
[228:35.97]He keeps a tavern at Salt Bay.
[228:38.47]If our reputation is high, perhaps the wind of fortune will be with us and we'll find the captain's cousin alive.
[228:44.50]So we're gonna go to Salt Bay.
[228:46.56]Salt Bay!
[228:55.57]I'm sorry, I just, that got me.
[228:57.31]That got me really bad, really quickly, and really aggressively.
[229:05.20]Ooh, okay, how much is it?
[229:06.66]Okay, I got 20 crew members now.
[229:12.49]We can go mass, let's go destroy some shit.
[229:27.16]Sell cargo.
[229:27.82]What do I got?
[229:28.44]I got cheese, right?
[229:30.40]Ooh.
[229:33.76]I got 2,000?
[229:34.70]2,500 gold.
[229:35.91]Probably shouldn't sell everything.
[229:39.09]I have ammo.
[229:50.62]I think I'm good.
[229:51.64]I'm not fighting anybody.
[229:52.42]I'm just going to do diplomacy only.
[229:57.43]So now we have to go to the Salt Bay.
[229:58.91]That's our mission, right?
[229:59.73]Alright, where is Salt Bay?
[230:05.63]Right there.
[230:06.83]Alright, so apparently the pirate that we need to find is down here.
[230:14.68]Guys, I don't even know how to fire the cannon.
[230:16.04]I'm not gonna... This is... crunchy.
[230:28.53]Oh shit.

[232:09.53]I'm in a canoe.
[232:11.01]And it's tipping over.
[232:13.79]Um.
[232:24.47]Okay.
[232:33.11]Ah!
[232:34.39]Ah!

[232:58.22]Uh, I'm done with this one.
[233:11.31]Wait, there's the options.
[233:12.43]Okay, I can... Where's the key bindings?
[233:18.49]Or, uh, there's probably a manual.
[233:20.82]This is the weirdest menu I've ever seen.
[233:27.26]Apparently I already reduced this.
[233:31.00]Bird means speech, horn means volume, scroll help is rat, 3D game speed slow is turtle, 3D game speed medium is horseshoe?
[233:43.66]That's not a horseshoe crap.
[233:45.44]That is a seahorse.
[233:47.21]The music's very loud, it's really- it's getting into my cerebral and it's fucking with my voice.
[234:06.76]What even is this a picture of?
[234:09.61]Oh, this is wonderful.
[234:11.07]I love this.
[234:12.73]Okay.
[234:13.95]That was a crazy one.
[234:16.01]Hey, let's get some claps in the chat for that one.
[234:21.38]That one's fucking crazy.
[234:24.68]It has all their names too.
[234:26.03]That's so awesome.
[234:27.13]I love it.
[234:32.56]Okay, coming up next is, I don't even know how long I want to play this one for, but Clive Barker's Undying.
[234:40.55]Is that doing it for anybody?
[234:44.57]Clive Barker's Undying.
[234:52.97]Good.
[234:53.79]Classic.
[234:54.29]Let's go.
[234:54.83]Let's go.
[234:55.27]I'm seeing lots of, I made it up, but I'm seeing lots of let's goes in my head.
[235:07.29]Okay, it might be loud.
[235:08.25]Just be careful.
[235:12.23]Oh, that didn't want to open.
[235:17.36]Uh-oh.
[235:18.78]What does that even say?
[235:29.77]General protection fault.
[235:31.97]Oh, no.
[235:32.33]That's not good.
[235:36.15]It opened earlier.
[235:36.83]I got it to open before.
[235:37.69]Come on.
[235:43.55]Come on.
[235:44.13]What?
[235:47.83]Need to run it as administrator?
[235:49.15]I already did.
[235:52.25]I'll get it set for next time.
[235:54.89]We have a couple of... This one might be weird, but it's alright.
[236:04.19]I'm going to leave this because I wanted some time to play Arx Fatalis.
[236:08.77]And I'm going to leave this up to the... I almost said the two of you.
[236:12.22]There are way more than two people here.
[236:13.92]I'm going to leave it up to the two of you.
[236:17.16]What's wrong with me today?
[236:19.97]Can we get a poll in the chat?
[236:22.19]Do you want to see Bloodnet or Arx Fatalis?
[236:35.84]Bloodnet or Arx Fatalis?
[236:46.49]Bloodnet is a... I don't even know how to categorize it.
[236:50.23]It's a vampire game.
[236:51.78]Looks like it's half point and click, half cutscene.
[236:56.22]It's kind of like a Dracula-like.
[236:59.42]And Arx Fatalis obviously is Arx Fatalis, and I think that one's going to be pretty good.
[237:08.70]That is a... It's Oblivion before Oblivion.
[237:13.88]Morrowind before Morrowind.
[237:16.75]When did Morrowind come out?
[237:18.91]Because I may have just made the whole internet very angry by saying that.
[237:27.53]Looks like it's a blood net.
[237:34.62]Okay.
[237:35.86]This one looks very odd.
[237:37.38]So I'm down.
[237:37.98]I'm down.
[237:39.66]Let's go.
[237:41.02]This is the CD version of the game.
[237:42.42]I don't, I gotta, I don't know what could, I gotta be careful.
[237:45.48]This game might be fucked up.
[237:53.79]Blood dead.
[237:59.50]On a cold evening in Manhattan, you relax in your favorite bar, the Abus.
[238:06.20]As you order another round, you notice a striking exotic woman staring at you from across the room.
[238:12.81]Still staring, she walks towards you and makes her offer.
[238:33.69]Fifty grand?
[239:01.85]For 50 grand?
[239:03.29]There isn't much I wouldn't do for 50 grand.
[239:06.57]I'm not interested in your personal life, Stark.
[239:10.13]What I want is some business taken care of.
[239:14.02]A man named Clayton McCrae with the Transtech Cyber Eye Bureau is making my life very difficult.
[239:21.04]My father and I have indulged in a few business practices that conflict with the company's policies and aren't going to sit well with the judgment committee.
[239:32.25]I want the records of them wiped off the discs.
[239:36.87]Okay, wiped the discs.
[239:37.75]Or McCrae commits that I'm not worth investigating.
[239:40.59]Ever.
[239:42.57]I don't care how you do it.
[239:45.29]Just do it and you'll get paid.
[239:47.51]Okay, sounds good.
[239:50.21]Agreed?
[239:50.35]Are you part of the deal?
[239:52.59]Just do what you're hired to do, Stark.
[239:55.93]You'll get paid.
[239:57.75]Then we'll talk.
[239:59.33]Where do I find you?
[240:01.22]Uptown at 666 West 125th Street.
[240:04.72]The penthouse.
[240:05.42]Repeat that?
[240:07.14]I'll be waiting.
[240:14.26]Because you are a brofessional.
[240:18.26]The job... The brofessionals.
[240:20.92]I feel like that's a YouTube group.
[240:24.82]It's like a group of like six dudes.
[240:27.41]The brofessionals.
[240:28.73]The job takes only a few days.
[240:31.96]You transfer the information to Van Helsing and take the subway to his penthouse to collect your payment.
[240:38.67]Wait, I already did it?
[240:39.67]Apparently I did it.
[240:48.61]I'm here for my 50 grand.
[240:51.40]You work fast.
[240:54.00]Not too fast.
[240:55.38]I get the job done.
[240:57.14]Now I'm here to collect.
[241:00.01]Relax.
[241:01.65]You'll get what's coming to you.
[241:04.69]That's what I'm counting on.
[241:07.17]You've got a real attitude, Stark.
[241:10.67]Too bad we haven't met under different circumstances.
[241:14.41]I'm not usually one to go for low-rent mercenary types.
[241:19.60]Don't knock it till you've tried.
[241:21.96]Besides, you're not exactly standard issue.
[241:25.46]what's your story anyway you come out of nowhere with the most unusual captivating looks I've ever seen on anyone then offer me a fortune for a job I could do in my sleep I couldn't wait to get up here to see you again you're like no woman I've ever met I'm not sure I like what you're doing to me that's not a porn game guys until you've tried it stark
[241:52.54]No, this isn't a porn game.
[241:54.26]Is this a porn game?
[241:56.36]I didn't download a porn game.
[241:57.46]This kind of sounds like a porn game.
[241:58.78]No, it's not.
[241:59.66]It's not.
[242:17.76]She was a friend.
[242:19.62]A good friend.
[242:20.94]I haven't even talked to Tackett in years.
[242:24.06]Heard she was somewhere in the Greenwich Village Warrens.
[242:27.82]I should look her up.
[242:30.08]I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her.
[242:33.47]How true, but let's forget about her.
[242:37.17]One woman saved you, Stark, and now one's going to damn you.
[242:40.89]Did I download a romantic audiobook?
[242:45.91]Somebody called it an audio book.
[242:47.63]I want to know everything about you.
[242:54.56]Okay.
[242:56.54]So we're... Who's the guy in the corner?
[242:59.92]Who's the corner watcher?
[243:02.30]Is it Dracula?
[243:03.42]That will be enough, Melissa.
[243:15.82]You can amuse yourself with him later.
[243:18.42]What?
[243:19.68]I am Abraham Van Helsing.
[243:22.40]I thought he was going to say Lincoln.
[243:23.66]You work for me now, Stark.
[243:27.03]I'm not on your payroll anymore, Pop, so don't start throwing your weight around.
[243:32.61]You do not yet see the seriousness of your position.
[243:37.24]That was a way to introduce yourself as Abraham Lincoln.
[243:46.12]I am Abraham Lincoln, right?
[243:48.50]That's how you've always seen that and heard that.
[243:55.57]You have given me what I need.
[243:57.99]The address of Deirdre Tackett.
[244:00.65]My vampires and I have tracked dozens of former Transtech employees.
[244:05.54]You might have known where Tackett was hiding herself.
[244:09.60]At last, we found you.
[244:12.64]Your time as my minion has just begun.
[244:17.26]Come to me, Stark.
[244:19.81]Feel my mouth on your neck.
[244:23.87]It is a porn game!
[244:25.89]I think it is a porn game!
[244:27.83]What is he doing?
[244:55.05]These are all actor headshots.
[244:59.10]Those of you actors out there, you really gotta show emotion in your headshots.
[245:02.10]Don't just do the standard look at the camera.
[245:05.98]You gotta show your range, man.
[245:07.64]You gotta show your range.
[245:10.04]Oh, that was fucking crazy.
[245:12.90]Untold hours after Van Helsing's attack, you awakened dazed and wracked with pain in a surreal tomb-like chamber.
[245:28.01]This music is... This music is... Here he comes again.
[245:31.02]No, don't do it again.
[245:34.06]What have I become?
[245:36.58]What have you done to me?
[245:39.84]You are one of us now, Stark.
[245:42.84]A vampire.
[245:44.72]A hunter of men.
[245:46.84]And because you are of my creation, you are under my command.
[245:52.84]But... But... Why?
[245:57.00]I can use a freelance with your talents in my cadre of nightstalkers.
[246:01.54]When we have captured Tackett and taken from her the information that we need, I will be but one step from attaining power over Manhattan, cyberspace, and beyond.
[246:13.67]I shall control the Earth's computers.
[246:16.28]I shall have power without limit.
[246:20.14]And I'm gonna help you.
[246:22.32]Computers?
[246:23.14]You already have.
[246:25.75]Giving me Tackett is like handing over Incubus, the ultimate icebreaker, to me.
[246:33.55]Come.
[246:34.93]You have much to learn.
[246:37.34]You must be weak after what you've endured.
[246:40.54]Let us venture outside and select your dinner.
[246:45.89]Oh, no.
[246:47.57]I'm gonna have to eat somebody.
[246:54.42]Oh, boy.
[246:54.92]Did I just shoot him?
[246:56.44]I shot him!
[246:58.86]I just shot him in the head!
[247:02.46]Wait, no, he shot me?
[247:03.62]No, he punched me.
[247:04.89]Who hurt me?
[247:06.17]What?
[247:07.17]I didn't do that.
[247:07.69]He did that to me.
[247:09.37]Your sudden blow stuns the... Wait, no, I did hit him.
[247:12.63]Your sudden blow stuns the vampire lord, allowing you to make a mad dash for the penthouse, the street, not pausing to catch your breath.
[247:22.31]You run to the subway, desperate to reach Racket's Laboratory before it's too late.
[247:32.66]Who is this?
[247:34.99]Wait, is my implant talking to me?
[247:56.03]He tried to transform me into one.
[247:58.87]He expected to control me, but I'm still in charge, I think.
[248:02.69]He's two feet tall.
[248:04.07]I feel both awful and great.
[248:07.89]My whole body aches, but I feel strong enough to kick through a wall.
[248:13.27]He is so small, you're right.
[248:14.88]God, look at my flesh.
[248:18.90]My mouth aches, my teeth are sharper.
[248:24.79]I think I have fangs I'm a vampire rip on yourself ransom current inputs are confusing enough I need less babble from you and more analysis I'm doing my best here it's not every day somebody bites my neck open and sucks on my arteries analysis I've become a vampire it seems
[248:48.68]Except, for some reason, I'm able to resist Van Helsing's domination.
[248:54.00]Maybe you have something to do with that.
[248:56.49]Assuredly, Ransom.
[248:58.65]Van Helsing's attack almost fried me, and I've been working double-time to counter the vampiric elements that Van Helsing introduced into your identity matrix.
[249:08.84]I have managed to slow the rate at which you're becoming a vampire but as I mentioned the drain on me is considerable I compute that at present outlays I will cease to function in days and you will irrevocably become a vampire you're saying I'm not damned yet?
[249:28.76]there's still hope?
[249:31.17]My presence has helped you maintain a grip on your humanity.
[249:35.31]You are, for the most part, a vampire, but I think that state is straight and personal.
[249:41.23]I need to snooze this ad break
[250:12.67]Do I?
[250:13.07]Is there?
[250:13.53]Okay, there is a game now.
[250:17.33]Here's the video game.
[250:19.25]Holy shit, that was... That was one of the most outrageous intros of a video game I've ever seen in my whole life.
[250:29.54]I'm making my character now.
[250:31.02]That was just the beginning.
[250:34.83]Oh!
[250:41.26]Okay, or...
[251:11.65]Wait for Toby outside his Greenwich Village flat.
[251:14.77]Sock him in the jaw with a set of sizzle... nucks.
[251:18.93]Okay.
[251:21.33]Jury rig a flash grenade and place it in Toby's mailbox to surprise him in the morning.
[251:26.24]Alright, that one's kind of fucking crazy.
[251:29.54]Invite Toby to dinner at the Geisha bar where you have hired the ranters to greet him and show him the error of his ways.
[251:37.44]Um...
[251:43.56]Okay, we either drain his bank account and take everything from him because he walked out on a bill, punch him in the face with brass knuckles, or put a bomb in his mailbox.
[251:56.30]That's a little extreme, I think.
[251:59.01]Or say, hey, what you did was not a good thing.
[252:02.19]I think this one's kind of crazy.
[252:08.81]You hack into his account and drain his bank account.
[252:15.61]Alright, I'm going to drain his bank account.
[252:19.11]No, I'm going to punch him because that might give us the ability to punch people.
[252:26.66]Jesus.
[252:30.12]I don't know what any of that means.
[252:30.92]I think that means... I... give them spare parts to maybe get them going?
[252:33.58]Okay.
[253:00.28]Write a program that will randomly generate factual information based on a resident lexicon and present it to them in the hope that it will keep them busy for a while.
[253:07.90]That's kind of lame.
[253:12.74]Pull them into a dark alley one evening, show them the largest firearm you own, and explain to them what will happen if they don't leave you alone.
[253:18.67]Oh my god.
[253:22.85]Pay them to assist you in your frequent scrounges through the industrial scrapyards in New Jersey and Queens.
[253:29.63]That's kind of good.
[253:34.81]We get, I think that, hey, pays to have, like, for some, for assistance.
[253:40.00]We can do some scrounging.
[253:42.84]Oh yeah, or flash a gun and be like, hey, look what happens.
[253:46.78]I think I'm going to pay.
[253:48.46]And I also think I'm going to take a break because I feel like I need to after that.
[253:52.81]So I'll be back in a few minutes.
[253:57.03]We will.
[253:58.55]I think we got a gold one here.
[254:01.31]This one is a gold one.
[254:04.57]I think we got one.
[254:08.01]I'll be right back.
[254:10.51]This music's great too.
[254:11.23]I'm going to keep the music.
[254:15.18]I am Abraham Van Helsing.
[254:21.84]Uh, it wasn't Abraham Lincoln in the, in a Van Helsing spinoff remake thing.
[254:27.02]Oh yeah.
[254:32.03]Yeah.
[254:32.33]Alright, guys, I'm back.
[254:35.41]Ads will start in about 20 seconds or so.
[254:36.85]See you soon.
[255:07.44]Thank you.
[256:18.83]Thank you.
[257:57.56]Thank you.
[258:57.30]Thank you.
[260:16.35]Okay, how are you?
[260:17.87]Sorry, I may have just jumpscared some of you.
[260:21.27]Let's continue our quiz.
[260:30.24]I love these old games so much.
[260:38.48]I'm so glad that people are trying to keep them going.
[260:45.75]Put them in the DOS box or whatever.
[260:48.35]The people that actually put that stuff together.
[260:52.01]It's great.
[260:53.09]I'm glad.
[260:53.49]Okay.
[260:58.85]So...
[261:02.11]Here we go.
[261:04.15]So I think I'm going to, I want to, I think I'm going to pay them to assist you.
[261:06.89]I think that, cause maybe, maybe that means like I'm more social and I get charisma points or something.
[261:12.95]I don't know.
[261:13.33]I'm going to do that one.
[261:15.88]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[261:17.10]I forgot to tell you that was going to happen.
[261:20.98]Okay.
[261:21.34]Pandemic Broadcasting hires you to break up a ring of stim cassette pirates operating somewhere in hell's kitchen.
[261:28.86]before you can stop them you must find them you circulate through dark alleys and seedy bars threatening informants with physical violence until you obtain some clue to the pirates whereabouts deck into cyberspace to question several data angels who might have information about the stim pirates okay disassemble one of the pirate cassettes and examine the components for a clue that might put you on the pirates trail that maybe
[261:57.46]Deck into cyberspace and access the records of the company's manufacturing cassettes for evidence of illegal sales.
[262:13.38]I think I'm doing this one.
[262:18.32]Just so you know, this game is literally 90% listening to people speak.
[262:25.33]I'm alright with that.
[262:26.34]This is cozy.
[262:27.30]I'm cool with that.
[262:28.28]That sounds good.
[262:30.42]Deck in, bro.
[262:31.00]I'm going.
[262:31.32]I'm going.
[262:35.94]You score a hot program for the Midtown Mafia, but the snakes pay you only half of what they promised, and they have the nerve to smile about it.
[262:44.72]You smile back, but no one stiffs Ransom Stark and gets away with it.
[262:49.06]In retaliation, you begin to leave, then pull out a concealed laser pistol from inside your sleeve and fire away, okay?
[262:57.14]Wait, then break into their headquarters in the abandoned Trump Tower.
[263:00.67]Wait, what?
[263:01.93]Steal back the program and sell it to a rival family.
[263:08.11]Okay.
[263:09.79]Wait then on your system at home.
[263:11.79]Hack around for their financial accounts at various institutions and start creating insufficient funds.
[263:19.91]I think I'm going the Han Solo way, you know?
[263:27.12]This looks like this is an important one.
[263:28.74]We got a change in...
[263:31.42]We get a change in scenery here.
[263:34.26]While making a rare visit to the Café Voltaire, you learn that a radical group called the Kafka Conspiracy is plotting to introduce a perceptual distortion generator into the virtual architecture of Transtechnical's cyberspace.
[263:48.63]You report what you have learned to the director of Transtechnical's external security division in the expectation of receiving a reward or at least being contracted to neutralize the Kafka Conspiracy.
[264:02.29]Okay.
[264:05.77]Engage the conspirators in heated debate over the morality of their anarchic agenda.
[264:12.36]Oh, it's a debate?
[264:14.72]Suggest that launching a physical attack on Transtech's headquarters in Brooklyn would be more effective an offer for a fee to train them in armed terrorism.
[264:24.27]Okay, I don't... I'm not doing that one, I don't think.
[264:28.83]I don't think I'm doing that one.
[264:29.95]I don't think I'm doing that one.
[264:31.77]A heated debate?
[264:32.51]Okay, how about a heated debate?
[264:56.89]Look at this artwork.
[264:58.25]As a kid, you always enjoyed prankstering every year during the big electronic lifestyle show at Javits Center.
[265:05.46]You were most proud of... Ruining General Circuitry's GCN America We Care exhibit by replacing their promo video with footage of the military weaponry they were manufacturing being used by kids.
[265:19.15]Holy shit.
[265:20.55]Setting off EMP grenades when the show was being covered by the local press rendering all the electronics useless.
[265:27.89]rigging we allow the public to enter briefly day by programming the admission booths not to deduct the fee from guest bank cards oh that's alright I'll do that one maybe this one this is free shit right alright we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna do free shit
[265:49.56]While drifting through Lower Manhattan one evening, you discover an alley, a crate, bearing the Transtechnicals logo.
[265:56.88]The crate contains machinery that is foreign to you.
[265:59.22]You take it back to your workshop and spend days disassembling it.
[266:03.95]Disassemble the machine and use the components you are familiar with on other projects.
[266:09.61]Deck in, bro, and begin accessing sources known to you in search of information about the machine's purpose.
[266:17.22]anonymously contact a middle manager at transtech and attempt to sell the device back to them you insist on a high price all the while keeping secret your ignorance of the device's purpose this one you've always told yourself that if you knew you were about to be busted for your litany of hacking crimes you would orchestrate your own death get yourself a new identity and start another career you always plan to go about it by
[266:45.93]Staging a violent death for yourself, complete with signs of a bloody struggle.
[266:50.46]Making sure you never even existed, erasing all records bearing your name.
[266:55.04]When your work is done, no one will have proof that you ever were even alive.
[267:00.44]Become the opposite of your former self.
[267:02.66]Since you lived as an intellectual, you plan to cyber-enhance your physical form and become a killing machine for hire.
[267:07.86]I think this is strength.
[267:12.76]This one you get plus strength.
[267:14.10]So I'm gonna do this one.
[267:19.58]There's a lot of questions.
[267:22.94]While wandering through the streets of Manhattan after midnight, you're knocked out cold by a blast from a powerful stun gun.
[267:29.57]When you regain consciousness, you find yourself in a locked cell.
[267:32.91]Two new recruits of the Strident Zugs are verbally abusing you.
[267:40.28]You reach into your boot, pull out a small flash bomb, toss it outside the cell.
[267:43.42]The explosion stuns the two.
[267:45.10]You're able to pick the lock, attack them with this... Oh yeah, that's a good one.
[267:49.66]Retrieve hidden shurikens from your boot and hurl them at the two zugs.
[267:55.02]Okay, that's the same as the other one, but shurikens.
[267:58.99]Beg the zugs to let you out because of your serious illness.
[268:02.09]You then fake a violent seizure.
[268:04.39]When the zugs open the cell to check your condition, you surprise attack them and cut their throats with your hidden knife.
[268:10.84]Holy shit.
[268:11.56]Alright, this one is gun.
[268:13.81]Okay, it's gun, flash grenade, shurikens, or knife.
[268:15.67]How about just gun?
[268:38.64]I will say every time the screen comes forward, each new layer, it's lagging the game a little more.
[268:44.41]So I'm getting a little concerned that it might crash.
[268:48.79]And if that happens, then I'm just going to pick the random one.
[268:53.87]Holy shit, dude.
[269:21.89]Wait until the fat man has finished... I keep thinking of Stuart Griffin saying this.
[269:26.66]Wait until the fat man has finished pummeling his victims, and then try to convince him to join you on your next dangerous mission.
[269:32.76]When he resists, offer him a cash payment for his services.
[269:35.42]Okay, mercenary.
[269:39.42]Approach the fat man from behind, zap him with a taser gun that leaves him momentarily stunned, and then slice his hamstrings with your bowie knife.
[269:46.57]Holy moly!
[269:50.55]Grab the fat man's arm, twist it behind his back, and snap it, kicking him two or three times for having the nerve.
[269:57.80]Let's do that one.
[269:59.80]Alright.
[270:01.66]When you need to earn extra money, you... Fence hardware that you salvage from the scrapyard.
[270:08.15]Assemble whatever weapons or hardware you can from the components you have on stock and sell them.
[270:13.35]Take the grifting by pulling small cons throughout the city.
[270:15.77]Yeah, let's do that.
[270:20.11]In a bar brawl, you and your friend Lash Givens encounter superior numbers of rage gangers.
[270:26.41]You decide that survival is the better part of valor and run like heck.
[270:32.00]Despite the risks involved, consume a potentially dangerous combination of red lifters, hero makers, and breathers to increase your strength of recklessness and endurance.
[270:40.98]Yep.
[270:43.78]There we are.
[270:47.92]69 strength 79 endurance 70 agility 62 stealth 27 pickpocket I still I got more points alright melee firearms biotech explosives leadership innocence faith courage will oh here they are the seven um virtues leadership innocence faith courage will and bribery
[271:19.22]I don't know what any of this really does.
[271:20.68]Do we just keep going all in on strength?
[271:35.24]I feel like we need to keep the one that we know, which is this one, right?
[271:41.93]Although that one is pretty good too.
[271:47.48]That one's just like every other magician I've ever seen.
[271:54.84]Yeah, that's a magician LinkedIn profile picture.
[271:59.22]I like this one.
[272:08.69]Let's do melee.
[272:13.29]And let's dump into strength.
[272:18.44]Modify skills.
[272:19.52]I can... Oh, here we go.
[272:22.53]Cyber cloaking?
[272:23.27]I'm not that smart.
[272:26.65]I'm actually pretty dumb.
[272:29.83]How do I have three points still?
[272:40.37]Modify skills.
[272:41.37]Where are they?
[272:47.33]Is that just a typo?
[272:48.51]Because I can modify skills three.
[272:53.47]Okay, well, let's go.
[272:58.85]Go all in on bribery.
[273:00.25]No, I need to go all in on punching people in the face because that's all I'm going to be able to do.
[273:07.64]Oh, you can choose up to five things.
[273:09.22]Okay, let's see.
[273:10.22]Here we go.
[273:12.88]Let's watch the audiobook.
[273:16.92]Okay.
[273:17.18]Day one.
[273:20.44]Combat.
[273:21.50]Quick descriptive bite.
[273:26.75]View.
[273:27.99]Examine.
[273:28.55]Okay.
[273:30.45]Party.
[273:31.01]Rest.
[273:31.59]Dismiss.
[273:33.83]Enter cyberspace.
[273:36.65]Computer.
[273:37.25]Alright.
[273:37.92]I think I can walk around.
[273:43.32]Save the game.
[273:44.00]Oh my goodness.
[273:44.50]You're right.
[273:49.43]This is a gnarly save menu.
[273:58.22]Okay.
[273:59.84]What's this?
[274:09.22]What do I do with this thing?
[274:25.21]Do I have an inventory?
[274:31.89]Why you little... I don't... I know.
[274:33.61]It's weird.
[274:34.25]I don't get it either.
[274:39.43]Can I leave this room?
[274:43.77]You're next, Stark.
[274:44.91]Okay.
[274:46.33]So... View.
[274:48.85]What about search?
[274:50.43]Ransom Stark, the most observant member of the party, searches the area and finds nothing.
[274:58.71]Examine.
[275:00.43]This.
[275:07.53]Examine?
[275:09.03]Maybe I have to hold it first?
[275:09.81]Okay.
[275:18.40]Circuitry designed to detect and analyze the magnitude and physics of a force striking the sensors or circuitry to which they are linked.
[275:26.40]Can I use it?
[275:33.83]You cannot use the inertia sensors.
[275:35.69]What about this thing?
[275:42.49]Neural implant plans.
[275:43.63]The design to Deirdre Tackett's groundbreaking neural implant that remedies Hopkins-Bree syndrome.
[275:55.40]Should I back into the cyberspace?
[276:08.31]That's very, uh... I guess that's one way to do it.
[276:20.74]And... am I in it?
[276:24.67]I think I'm inside of it.
[276:28.91]Do I collect the gems?
[276:42.28]This is insanity.
[276:46.53]What was the purpose of a... I just picked up something.
[276:53.11]You spin through the general plane, the cyberspace highway, the space in between all the clusters and wells in the network to access a cluster.
[277:00.78]You must interface with a FATS terminal.
[277:07.82]How do I interface?
[277:11.64]You're Stark, aren't you?
[277:14.18]I've heard of you.
[277:15.10]Listen, take my advice.
[277:19.16]Steer clear of Zeus.
[277:21.76]You do not want to tangle with that guy.
[277:24.58]He's powerful.
[277:27.24]He has access to any information he wants.
[277:31.83]And I hear he's looking for you.
[277:36.58]Yeah, well, if you don't mind, I'll wait to meeting before I start getting intimidated.
[277:42.27]Well, you have reason to be.
[277:44.09]Believe me.
[277:45.65]He's done damage in here that's unprecedented.
[277:49.13]It's more than just freaking with systems.
[277:52.31]He's actually into damaging angels in here, pulverizing their decking integrity.
[277:58.68]I mean, guys have found themselves broken up in the net just because Zeus didn't like their attitude.
[278:06.14]I'd stay out of his way if I were you.
[278:09.29]Don't say I didn't warn you.
[278:12.48]Listen here, pal.
[278:15.24]Hey, now here.
[278:15.96]There's the deal.
[278:18.02]If he said, here's the deal, it would've been pretty good.
[278:22.29]What is this thing?
[278:22.89]Can I interact with this guy?
[278:28.77]I'm the file access table system module for this quadrant.
[278:32.65]Call me Fats.
[278:34.45]If you provide me with a destination address, I can transmit your matrix instantaneously.
[278:43.70]Um, wasn't it this?
[278:49.79]My cyber skill is too low.
[278:51.25]I can't do anything.
[278:54.51]Why did I come into the cyberspace area if I have zero cyberspace ability?
[279:02.94]And how do I get out of here?
[279:15.38]I need a FATS terminal.
[279:16.80]Is this not a FATS terminal?
[279:27.99]Yeah, this is it.
[279:28.63]I need a destination address.
[279:29.83]I don't know how many of that.
[279:44.63]I don't think I got one of these.
[279:49.05]And my skills are not good enough.
[279:51.20]I think I'm actually stuck in here forever.
[279:52.72]Type in Manhattan?
[279:59.89]Will that work?
[280:09.94]Yeah, I don't have enough cyber skill points to do it, I guess.
[280:13.98]So I guess I just float around now.
[280:15.34]I get bit by a vampire and I just do this now.
[280:24.09]This is so bizarre.
[280:25.45]I love it.
[280:27.75]But I need to figure out how to play it.
[280:29.68]Oh!
[280:34.47]You've been apprehended by a security cage.
[280:36.89]Your decking unit's memory is being erased.
[280:40.25]Unsanctioned decking is forbidden.
[280:42.11]Do not return.
[280:43.01]That's like... kick me out!
[280:51.98]Kick me out of here!
[281:05.27]Oh, you right-clicked the top of the screen.
[281:11.77]Thank you, chatter.
[281:13.35]Huge.
[281:14.57]Actually, huge deal.
[281:15.47]Alright, so what do I do with this shit?
[281:24.84]This is such an obscure point-and-click game, but I need to see out of this room.
[281:29.36]I have to.
[281:38.62]Map of New York?
[281:39.34]Ah, okay.
[281:45.82]So where do I want to go?
[281:46.58]Wall Street?
[281:53.56]Um... The undead!
[281:57.42]Walk before us!
[281:59.84]Kill the hell spawned bastard!
[282:11.34]Left click on the location to place the character.
[282:13.58]Strike the spacebar to skip to the next character?
[282:16.48]It's like a JRPG?
[282:19.96]Is it like turn-based?
[282:32.11]Okay, issue orders.
[282:35.25]Position cursor over any character to view status.
[282:37.47]Left click on a party member to issue orders.
[282:42.18]78 HP, free combat, laser pistol, 20 rounds.
[282:47.09]Fight.
[282:49.13]Fight this guy in the neck.
[282:58.54]Shoot him in the head.
[282:59.44]And then done.
[283:21.43]Ummm...
[283:24.36]Kahnema Stewart hit Ransom Stark with a laser pistol in the torso.
[283:28.19]14 points of damage.
[283:30.63]Liz Ballesteros hit Ransom Stark with a 9mm pistol in the right leg.
[283:34.43]38 points of damage.
[283:36.45]Ransom Stark missed.
[283:37.69]Liz Ballesteros with the laser pistol.
[283:40.51]Luella Travesty hit Ransom Stark with a sawed-off shotgun in the right leg for 44 points of damage.
[283:45.97]Ransom Stark is dead.
[283:50.53]You succumb to your greatest enemy.
[283:52.15]What is this guy?
[284:02.76]So that was a high level area.
[284:04.14]Good to know.
[284:06.61]This game is fucking crazy.
[284:18.29]Washington Square?
[284:19.17]I think I have to go here, right?
[284:21.93]I am here.
[284:26.74]What about this shit?
[284:27.54]What is this thing?
[284:28.56]Examine.
[284:30.26]Decking unit case.
[284:39.17]Use?
[284:39.43]Okay.
[284:44.61]I think I just have to go to a different place.
[284:49.95]This looks cool, but really confusing.
[284:53.17]It is, and it's definitely one of those games that you have to
[284:57.96]I don't know what is going on but I'm having fun doing it so it's it's all good okay now what welcome to the cafe voltaire my friend keep those weapons at your side
[285:19.63]I encourage my customers to discuss armed revolution, but I don't want it beginning here, you see.
[285:25.86]Can't say I've seen many bars like this one.
[285:29.03]There is none like it, sir.
[285:30.95]None.
[285:31.89]It is people, mon ami, who grant life and personality to a café.
[285:37.13]And it is the people who talk here ceaselessly, who drink absinthe cocktails, write poetry, experiment with technology, seduce one another with unbridled passion and imagination, who give this place spark.
[285:51.73]I've always been suspicious of wordy intellectuals.
[285:55.30]They think they can justify anything if they cover it over in enough bullshit.
[286:00.35]Aha, you have panache, you have attitude.
[286:04.27]Have a chair, have a gin.
[286:06.62]There will be entertainment later.
[286:08.80]Ultraviolet will be performing instantaneous poetry fashioned on stage from words extracted from her subconscious by a neural implant of her own design.
[286:18.96]She runs the output through a graphics program that converts the literal meanings and emotional connotations of the words into holograms projected throughout the room.
[286:30.31]not to be missed mon ami okay no no no I don't want to do that again uh save it and then I want to bite this guy I want to bite this guy's neck can you do that
[287:09.72]He's d- Okay, I killed that guy.
[287:12.40]Uh, the Mona Mii guy, I- I- I bit him and I killed him.
[287:15.76]And I disposed of his body.
[287:19.46]Uhhh... That didn't sit well with me, I guess?
[287:38.64]Would you like to hear my latest poem?
[287:41.38]Please?
[287:41.96]Yes.
[287:42.46]I love to share my work.
[287:44.52]Yes.
[287:45.30]Please.
[287:46.36]Please tell me it's Robert Frost.
[287:48.74]The silicon crests in my eyes as I awake to another wholesome trans-technicals breakfast.
[287:56.83]This time the toast is too crisp.
[287:59.67]A friend's burnt mind has crumbled to dust.
[288:03.83]His feeble form rots at the deck.
[288:07.41]His mind just plankton in the cybersea awash with the sediment of a thousand other dissolved integrities.
[288:15.30]I romp the sea for a mere term of the freedom to know.
[288:19.52]But do I rock the boat?
[288:22.26]Mine spills over with the juice of revolutionary idea.
[288:26.20]Every drop licked up by the data police and promptly disposed of while a record is made of my transgressions.
[288:35.53]Quiet tone for my sins at the great megacorp altar.
[288:39.07]It hears all and forgives all and demands only my soulless penance.
[288:46.21]Orwell, Sterling, Gibson, they washed us only in the water of electric knowledge.
[288:52.71]But one has come who surrounds us with a sea.
[288:56.61]Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink.
[289:01.63]It is the new god everywhere.
[289:05.09]A nano-deity that pervades the network of our soul.
[289:07.97]Yeah, at like 150k, this happens to everybody.
[289:10.63]What?
[289:17.26]Yeah, watch, ready?
[289:19.62]Oh yes, a fresh mind to connect with.
[289:22.36]Let's talk.
[289:23.40]Tell me what interests you.
[289:24.96]I'd like to learn all I can from you.
[289:27.06]There's always more to learn, more to talk about.
[289:29.50]Let's talk.
[289:31.50]I'm not really up for that right now, thanks.
[289:34.57]You're probably just not in tune to it.
[289:37.37]You need something to open your mind.
[289:39.68]A little Pyracetam would wake up your brain.
[289:42.42]If you want to specialize, I'm working on a combination of Centrophenazine to enhance intelligence.
[289:48.92]Is this like Dark Souls?
[289:49.92]Can I just kill every NPC?
[289:51.72]Of course, there are days when a whiff of Vasopressin is all you need for a full day of learning.
[289:56.99]But on my last deck, 20 milligrams of Sulfutium did the trick.
[290:02.17]The sheer qua- Along with a lot of medical waste.
[290:06.61]I take it mental fitness is not a subject of interest.
[290:10.07]Maybe something a little closer to home.
[290:13.15]Last aphrodisiac I mixed was a combination of biomocriptine and duprenal that was out of this world.
[290:20.02]None of us left the cafe for two days.
[290:22.90]Listen, I mix only for myself, but if you're interested, I could get you the means to be your own medicine man.
[290:29.82]I've upgraded my equipment, looking to unload my old pharmaceutical kit for, say, $300.
[290:36.56]Interested?
[290:37.24]300?
[290:38.74]Do I have $300?
[290:44.94]It's top of the line!
[290:46.62]Get all my equipment from Pharmaceutical Freaks, the best supply house in Manhattan.
[290:53.27]Okay.
[290:55.79]Dude, I have... I thought this was gonna be a big deal.
[290:58.39]Oh, you paid him $300.
[291:00.01]How much did I have?
[291:00.65]$200?
[291:00.67]$500?
[291:00.69]No, you have, um... You have $101,000.
[291:01.41]That's... I feel like I put a cheat code in.
[291:03.81]I didn't do anything.
[291:04.55]Usually you get a thousand coins to start a game like this.
[291:09.96]Apparently I have a hundred thousand.
[291:55.74]Okay, I think I'm going to play Arx Vitalis now.
[291:57.74]I feel like this is the kind of game you need to really, really sit there and learn everything.
[292:11.23]We got blown out from that intro that I don't know if I'm ready to learn a point and click adventure game right now after five hours.
[292:19.28]Maybe, okay, maybe I'll come back to this.
[292:30.17]That gets a bunch of claps, though, because it was absolutely hysterical in the first, like, 45 minutes or so.
[292:34.59]It was so ridiculous.
[292:37.50]What an intro.
[292:42.02]And I can do quick generation, too, so.
[292:47.30]That one was crazy.
[292:49.80]Alright.
[292:50.46]I've stalled for five hours, so that's cool.
[292:52.66]Now let's play the game I told you I was going to play five hours ago.
[292:57.30]Just a little late, just a little bit later than what I said.
[293:04.42]I want to play Undying as well.
[293:05.70]I'll fix Undying so we can play it next time.
[293:10.72]Get the mod for our... Yeah.
[293:12.40]Is the GOG version good or... Or is the GOG version not good?
[293:24.62]GOG is patched.
[293:27.10]Perfect.
[293:29.75]Alright, let's, uh, let's open this up.
[293:33.19]Hopefully it's not too loud, but just be aware it could be.
[293:35.76]And this is Arcane Studios.
[293:42.62]This is, what was the last thing they even made? 2001.
[294:13.72]Listen to me, beings of light, and take note of what I have to say.
[294:18.90]This is Arks, which was once a city like so many others, spreading proudly beneath the majesty of the sun.
[294:27.77]Oh, and I'm going to play Everhood 2 at some point this week.
[294:30.29]I'm into it and I want to try it.
[294:48.39]I'll turn it up when I get a chance to.
[294:50.55]It should be subtitles.
[295:09.18]Oh my god, that was scary!
[295:47.83]Is that my character?
[295:48.85]Because I hope so.
[295:49.55]That would be awesome.
[295:50.41]Is this what this game is?
[295:51.23]Dude, Ratman is such a cool character.
[296:08.60]You don't really see that that often, do you?
[296:13.16]Ratman.
[296:15.87]That's cool.
[296:19.11]Alright.
[296:20.59]New quest.
[296:28.15]So this is Tom Cruise.
[296:31.85]It actually may be based off of Tom Cruise's face.
[296:35.11]Alright.
[296:38.15]Strength is damage bonus in fights.
[296:39.87]Your ability to use heavy weapons.
[296:42.73]I like it.
[296:44.49]Mental determines your mana pool and resistance to magic.
[296:50.30]OK, technical skills, intuition, object knowledge.
[296:53.30]This is like knowledge.
[296:54.12]This is like intelligence.
[296:56.40]Dexterity is precision.
[296:59.22]Crits.
[297:00.93]Technical skills, stealth, oh man, it's one of those games where I can hide around and probably steal stuff from people.
[297:07.09]Constitution.
[297:08.67]Health, resistance to poison and wear heavy armor.
[297:14.65]Stealth.
[297:16.07]Technical skill OK.
[297:19.85]What do I want to do?
[297:21.83]And by the way, this game is good.
[297:24.75]This is a good, good game.
[297:27.13]Not saying the ones that you've seen so far are not.
[297:30.10]But this is a... People would consider this one a classic.
[297:33.26]So I'm going to take my time with this one.
[297:39.56]Although Chaser, I liked... They're all good.
[297:42.13]Look, these grab... That's why I do these grab bag nights.
[297:45.84]It's just whatever it is, it's just we're going to experience it for the first time, probably together.
[297:51.97]I definitely want to do... Should I do spells?
[298:04.10]Maybe I should do spell casting.
[298:14.43]Use Arc.
[298:15.63]Arc's Libertatis.
[298:16.99]I think this is the GOG version, so it should be patched.
[298:20.22]I guess that's what people were saying, right?
[298:30.10]I think my... My Twitch just crashed.
[298:37.40]Hold on.
[298:38.43]I can't see chat anymore.
[298:41.93]What?
[298:48.71]Yeah, my chat just crashed.
[298:49.87]What's up with that?
[298:50.49]I'm still live, right?
[298:59.15]Yeah, I think so.
[298:59.79]It says I am.
[299:03.66]Let me get you guys back.
[299:05.20]I just, you guys started, um, you were just gone.
[299:07.68]Oh, maybe not.
[299:09.28]Did my whole browser crash?
[299:11.50]Shit.
[299:15.60]Hold on one second.
[299:25.41]Weird.
[299:25.85]Maybe my internet did crash.
[299:33.65]I can't even open Twitch.
[299:43.55]I'm looking over to the mod chat right now.
[299:44.84]Am I still live?
[299:49.06]Why can I not connect?
[299:49.74]Why is my Twitch all fucked up then?
[299:51.20]That's weird.
[299:53.19]All fine.
[299:53.75]Yeah, weird.
[299:55.83]I lost access to the Twitch's actual website.
[300:01.14]I can't connect to it anymore, so.
[300:03.06]Sorry, chat.
[300:05.00]I'm just going to have to go.
[300:10.39]I'll try to reload it later.
[300:11.43]Sorry.
[300:12.59]I can't get your input and feedback now.
[300:14.37]What the heck?
[300:19.31]Hey, no chat.
[300:20.33]Is it going to be making a YouTube video again?
[300:23.83]That's very weird.
[300:27.52]Okay.
[300:29.64]I'm going to do mana.
[300:34.82]And stealth.
[300:42.61]I'm so indecisive on what I want to do here.
[300:52.30]Magic.
[300:52.86]Yeah.
[300:53.48]Let's be a magic Andy.
[300:56.52]Casting.
[300:57.46]Shit.
[300:57.78]I need some of that, right?
[301:01.16]Different levels of spells.
[301:02.50]There are 10 levels of spells.
[301:03.85]This skill also determines ability to protect yourself from magic.
[301:06.15]Good.
[301:06.39]Let's do 46.
[301:16.22]Presence of haunt.
[301:16.92]Yeah.
[301:17.12]Let's go full on casting.
[301:18.26]Alright.
[301:20.86]Appearance.
[301:21.28]What do I want to do?
[301:24.81]I guess you just pick between a few of these.
[301:26.45]I'll stay with Tom Cruise.
[301:34.36]Hopefully that's not a dog shit build, but it probably is.
[301:36.14]Okay.
[301:52.66]Who did that to me?
[302:04.38]I heard the game is very fun.
[302:06.44]So I'm looking forward to it.
[302:12.44]Tutorial can be found in the log section of your quest book.
[302:15.93]Right click to toggle from cursor mode to mouse lick mode.
[302:19.81]Okay.
[302:23.34]Those health bars and mana bars look really small.
[302:28.12]Mushroom?
[302:29.70]How do I pick it up?
[302:35.82]Cool, I get it.
[302:36.78]I look like I'm naked.
[302:39.82]Should I pick up random stuff?
[302:54.09]Who am I talking to?
[302:55.43]OK.
[302:55.55]Double click anybody to talk.
[302:57.15]Cool.
[302:57.25]I'm going to turn it up.
[302:58.21]Except people are saying it's too low.
[303:27.72]Alright, let me see if I can get the chat back.
[303:30.78]I need to pull up from here.
[303:32.90]Come on, give me the chat back.
[303:35.50]This is bullshit.
[303:37.58]Why am I having such a hard time connecting to Twitch?
[303:42.89]Do other websites work?
[303:44.05]Like, what's going on here?
[303:49.47]I think so.
[304:02.28]Okay, there we go.
[304:03.62]Finally.
[304:04.08]Yeah, I don't know what's going on there.
[304:06.16]That's weird.
[304:07.75]Finally got it back.
[304:12.49]I'm going to hear my own stream here in a second.
[304:19.96]Finally, I can see.
[304:33.17]Alright, there we go.
[304:38.55]OK, crisis averted.
[304:40.89]Let's continue.
[304:41.39]Alright, so I walk around like this.
[304:55.32]And I need to find something in my cell.
[304:57.02]Alright.
[305:05.16]Can I pull these like the Incredible Hulk?
[305:15.01]That's all it took to get out of here?
[305:16.29]This is a terrible prison.
[305:19.53]Lego game coded.
[305:33.53]I actually did pull the bars.
[305:36.41]Ooh, a bone.
[305:37.21]Okay, it's F or enter.
[305:43.90]Can I smash people with a bone?
[305:47.08]Tab is combat mode.
[305:57.55]Nice.
[305:59.65]Oh shit, okay.
[306:07.56]I feel like I make that sound.
[306:12.28]Your attacks are based on movement?
[306:21.34]I feel like I'm beating the shit out of this guy with a bone.
[306:23.28]Why is he still alive?
[306:30.25]Okay, cool.
[306:36.11]Dude had a carrot on him?

[307:11.29]I don't know, maybe.
[307:23.40]I like this inventory system a lot.
[307:26.30]There's three carrots down here.
[307:36.90]Ooh, damage, I get more bones?
[307:43.05]I already have bone.
[307:43.71]Hey, crouch.
[307:46.92]What the hell am I doing?
[307:47.96]Okay, they didn't teach me that yet.
[307:53.30]I don't know what that is.
[307:56.90]I want these carrots.
[307:57.62]Holy shit, free fish.
[308:13.55]Raw.
[308:19.24]It's raw.
[308:26.60]Did I let this guy out?
[308:37.63]How do I grab this?
[308:40.00]Oh, there we go.
[308:42.93]Thank you, Amshigar.
[308:44.73]If you can't remember your name, you better keep this one.
[308:47.69]It means, he who has no name in a foreign tongue.
[308:52.01]My name is Koltar, and I was part of the Traveler's Guild before I ended up here.
[308:57.25]Amshigar.
[308:59.17]It's a wild outfit.
[309:01.65]What is this Guild of Travelers?
[309:03.41]Where are my clothes?
[309:04.21]You really have lost your memory, haven't you?
[309:07.28]our world no longer has a sun to heat it and outside is nothing more than a huge expanse of ice only those who are trained and equipped for extreme conditions are allowed to make the dangerous trek between fortress cities hidden deep in the mountains these people are the guild of travelers right we shall discuss this later now let's get out of here alright let's escape
[309:31.27]I am injured.
[309:32.91]I won't be able to get through this hole.
[309:35.14]I'll stay here and wait till you can open the door.
[309:38.14]Don't worry about me.
[309:39.30]Okay.
[309:43.70]Cool.
[309:43.98]I'm gonna have to get used to the right click to get to this kind of grab stuff mode and then tab to go into fight mode.
[310:03.48]Mouse, let's turn this down.
[310:08.44]Takes a lot of getting used to.
[310:09.38]Yeah, but that's kind of like with any game like this though.
[310:14.79]I'm cool with it.
[310:15.53]I think it's fun.
[310:20.87]Crouch is default is X. Oh, that's weird.
[310:25.02]Usually it's C, right?
[310:26.56]Oh, it is C. Use auto ready combat mode.
[310:33.49]Let's try that.
[310:39.03]Well, anytime that somebody tries to fight you, you just pull your weapon up.
[310:42.44]That's probably better.
[310:43.14]Alright, let's get out.
[310:45.74]Can I open this?
[310:51.12]Pull it?
[310:52.38]Okay.
[310:52.60]What?
[310:59.75]We can try to break through the trap door on the floor.
[311:03.19]We may be able to find an alternate passage through there.
[311:07.07]Break through it?
[311:07.93]Do I have a... Where's my bone?
[311:15.91]Oh my goodness, it actually worked.
[311:17.17]I thought he was full of shit.
[311:22.65]Oh my god!
[311:23.72]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[311:25.10]I didn't want to do that!
[311:26.98]Now he wants to fight me!
[311:30.19]How do I de-aggro him?
[311:31.47]Can you de-aggro?
[311:32.73]How do I stop him from wanting to fight me?
[311:34.99]Oh, I'm going to dump this guy through the fucking hole.
[311:38.69]Yeah, I had to.
[311:42.01]I think he just screamed.
[311:54.80]Is he still going to be aggroed?
[312:00.05]Oh, I hope he wasn't an important NPC.
[312:06.75]But, uh, did you have anything on you?
[312:12.99]That sucks.
[312:13.87]That's not, uh, oops.
[312:19.20]I just wanted to, I just, I just, I just, I just, you know.
[312:23.06]What's in here?
[312:30.59]Ooh.
[312:35.47]Yeah, give me, give me, give me.
[312:36.31]Can I dual wield bones?
[312:38.55]I gotta be able to do double bones, right?
[312:42.03]Are these runes?
[312:44.73]Put them in your book.
[312:46.51]Enter or F. You have your first runes.
[312:51.00]Open your spell book.
[312:52.72]How do I open my book?
[312:56.30]Left-click on a spell icon to see its formula.
[312:58.14]The formula will stay on screen as reference when you close the book.
[313:14.41]So what does that do?
[313:17.55]Press and hold the magic mode to go into magic mode and draw the runes using left mouse button.
[313:36.78]That doesn't work.
[313:42.16]I just did it.
[313:42.64]What did that do?
[313:50.79]Revive him?
[313:51.49]Alright.
[313:55.59]Let me take, I gotta take one more ad break.
[313:57.73]I'll come back.
[313:58.39]I will try to revive him.
[313:59.69]I'll get through the beginning part of this game.
[314:01.24]I'm very, this is a cool game.
[314:03.12]I'm very interested.
[314:05.30]This will be the last one of the night though.
[314:09.10]I will see you guys in a few minutes.
[314:11.20]I'm gonna, I'm gonna get like a Coke or something.
[314:12.69]I need to, I need to spruce up a little.
[314:14.61]That last game just took so much out of me.
[314:16.29]I laughed so hard at the intro that now I'm like, my like brain is done.
[314:19.35]I'll be right back.
[319:06.94]Okay.
[319:08.12]I am ready.
[319:11.18]Yeah, I definitely think this is... I would play this for a whole stream.
[319:22.36]Judging by what I just did, I just... I killed this guy.
[319:25.81]That's kind of... I like that.
[319:31.33]There are consequences for your actions, and I feel like I just got consequented.
[319:34.69]Did I kill this rat?
[319:47.28]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[319:48.22]How do I equip stuff again?
[319:50.56]There we go.
[319:52.50]Did I smash this rat?
[319:53.38]What do I do?
[319:58.90]Oh shit, that was a mistake.
[320:02.54]How do I get out of here?
[320:03.06]Where's the exit?
[320:06.96]Try a cast ignite spell.
[320:19.46]I don't want to kill it.
[320:21.65]I just was testing.
[320:22.47]I didn't know there's so much freedom in this game.
[320:24.25]Alright, I'm going.
[320:28.37]I think I have to kill it.
[320:37.79]Okay, see you later.
[320:38.29]Alright, the ignite spell.
[320:47.98]Where do I learn the ignite spell?
[320:50.06]It just told me at the edge.
[320:51.06]It was like, hey, do the ignite spell around this corner.
[320:52.78]Are you serious?
[321:10.78]What are you doing?
[321:23.80]They're like rat meat.
[321:26.39]Uncooked rat ribs.
[321:28.25]Oh, yuck.
[321:37.67]Oh, cool.
[321:38.13]I put those on.
[321:38.87]Alright.
[321:49.77]So you said it was... Um, yuck.
[321:54.64]I just turned into the stream and you're over here eating rats.
[322:00.02]I'm alright.
[322:01.34]Torch.
[322:28.13]That was a crit.
[322:38.04]Put this away.
[322:42.52]This is raw.
[322:43.54]Okay, with the torch equipped, do it.
[322:50.07]Shit.
[323:11.03]To pre-cast a spell, press and hold stealth mode as you cast the spell.
[323:15.31]You can cast up to three spells.
[323:22.84]Try it again.
[323:30.10]That's too many.
[323:34.27]Come on.
[323:40.13]Come on!
[323:47.61]Magic is hard to do in widescreen.
[323:49.61]Oh shit, really?
[323:50.25]Switch to 4-3.
[324:21.30]I'm doing that right, right?
[324:22.32]Or close to it?
[324:23.36]I guess it's the shorter right side?
[324:29.65]Hmm.
[325:01.68]What?
[325:02.24]Didn't burn it?
[325:03.42]I didn't even... I could have just walked through this.
[325:05.19]It's... Yo.
[325:10.03]What's up?
[325:11.91]I hear frogs.
[325:22.94]Whoa, that's a big spider.
[325:24.42]Okay.
[325:27.93]Should I fight it?
[325:28.45]What if it kills me?
[325:31.29]Alright, it's gonna be good.
[325:40.19]That's not that's not being good and I how am I missing everything?
[325:48.19]I'm dead.
[325:53.27]I am so dead.
[325:57.32]I'm poisoned.
[325:57.92]I need to eat something right now.
[325:59.66]What do I have?
[326:00.40]I have raw meat.
[326:08.44]You have nothing on you?
[326:09.28]No way, right?
[326:18.84]No way.
[326:24.12]It's a spider?
[326:27.16]Yeah, but it's got to have something on them.
[326:31.44]Ignite the fireplace and place some raw food.
[326:34.06]Oh, cool.
[326:44.90]I think I just have to be faster with it.
[327:01.18]Ribs?
[327:02.10]Where'd they go?
[327:02.92]Ooh.
[327:13.75]Mods make spellcasting much better.
[327:15.35]Some folks say it's the only way to really play caster.
[327:18.00]Okay.
[327:18.72]I'll get it.
[327:20.86]I am very, very interested.
[327:22.34]I think this is going to be a whole stream.
[327:25.16]Soon.
[327:25.34]Okay.
[327:37.06]Alright, I'm good.
[327:37.64]Just break my hand?
[327:47.07]Yeah, I will definitely get the mod and then I'll start it back up again.
[327:54.66]Because I actually foresee this being an absolute wonderful experience.
[328:03.65]Alright, let's get a poll.
[328:04.66]Ready?
[328:05.38]How does this sound?
[328:07.12]Would you rather Arx Betalis Let's Go playthrough Yahoo or Everhood 2 Let's Go playthrough Yahoo?
[328:19.49]What would you like to see first?
[328:23.33]Because I'm cool with doing either one of those first.
[328:24.95]Is this a magic scroll?
[328:41.27]I will do both of them.
[328:42.21]It's just which one would you like to see in the next couple of days?
[328:48.05]Because that's what I would play a day or so from now.
[328:53.57]What did I get?
[328:54.37]Potion?
[328:58.59]Oh, cool.
[329:01.73]Magic missile.
[329:02.47]No way.
[329:02.93]Double click action on the spell symbol that has just appeared at the bottom of the screen.
[329:18.05]I didn't... Wait, I didn't learn that.
[329:19.86]I just casted it.
[329:30.62]Cool.
[329:32.66]Alright, I feel it.
[329:35.66]Damn, that's overwhelming.
[329:36.90]Okay.
[329:38.45]Yeah, I'll open with this in a couple days.
[329:40.13]I won't be live tomorrow.
[329:43.47]I'll be live the day after tomorrow.
[329:45.89]And I will begin my for real playthrough of this game.
[329:52.78]And you know what?
[329:53.38]I think I'm just gonna... I think I'm gonna end here.
[329:58.08]I think we'll call it here.
[330:01.82]I wanna go... I'll get the mod.
[330:03.66]Anything else I should get?
[330:08.64]Because I know it's starting to get late for a lot of East Coasters and I want to get some dinner as well.
[330:18.60]Yeah, Split Fiction with Etalyx, definitely we're going to finish it.
[330:27.27]Read the PC gaming wiki for this.
[330:29.01]Yeah.
[330:30.05]The next time you see this stream live, I will have all these things implemented.
[330:33.29]I'll make sure it's good to go.
[330:35.26]Because I think this is going to be a lot of fun.
[330:38.74]I'm into it for sure.
[330:39.48]I can I can smell it, right?
[330:42.98]You can just kind of smell how fun the game is going to be.
[330:46.10]I know it.
[330:47.50]I think this is going to be a great series.
[330:55.14]Blame daylight savings.
[330:56.09]Yeah, honestly.
[330:58.25]Alright, guys.
[331:00.07]I'll talk to you soon.
[331:08.72]Let me put the music on here.
[331:14.50]Where's the music?
[331:15.42]Where's my credits music?
[331:16.36]There it is.
[331:19.58]Do-do-do.
[331:20.38]Do-do-do.
[331:23.85]I'll do a fresh playthrough too.
[331:26.15]I feel like knowing that, maybe I wouldn't start with magic.
[331:28.13]Maybe I will though.
[331:28.75]I don't know.
[331:37.16]Yeah, I'm doing a fresh playthrough.
[331:39.90]I want that guy to stay alive.
[331:40.70]I feel like he's going to help me.
[331:54.83]I, as part of a contest for Everhood 2, I made mushroom sprites that you can find in the game.
[331:59.27]That's pretty cool.
[332:07.20]Yeah, we'll pick it up.
[332:10.28]Okay, those of you that have played Everhood 2, is it... How much crazier is it to Everhood 1?
[332:20.21]Are they comparable?
[332:21.07]Are they the same kind of difficulty as 1?
[332:22.59]1 is more.
[332:29.20]Four times harder?
[332:30.72]Much more?
[332:31.42]Oh, okay.
[332:37.78]Gameplay's alright, story's boring.
[332:45.00]It's a great stream, just disappointed you didn't give three count bounce a chance.
[332:53.30]I'll play it again.
[332:53.86]I just need a controller.
[333:02.32]lie yeah the clive barker game too yeah I'm down just to play whatever and like I said it's just we're gonna open up uh buccaneers for 20 minutes and drive around in a circle and get shot by cannon fire that's what we're gonna do
[333:31.89]What console were these?
[333:32.89]These were all old PC.
[333:37.93]Wait, Arc Space Halos might have been on Xbox or Xbox 360 or something, right?
[333:45.12]2001?
[333:48.92]Original Xbox?
[333:57.80]Strawberry Magic 2?
[334:03.47]Oh, I'm down with that.
[334:12.16]Wait, didn't everybody say they hated that game and it became kind of a joke to everybody in this community?
[334:18.70]And you hated it so much that now you actually want me to do it?
[334:24.24]That's right.
[334:24.94]Yeah, everybody hated that game.
[334:27.47]It actually got, I think it got 70% of the vote of people saying they wanted to get rid of it.
[334:33.99]And I denied them.
[334:35.11]And then I think it kept going down even more.
[334:37.01]I might have that completely backwards.
[334:39.59]Alright, it was fun.
[334:50.25]I love these grab bag nights.
[334:51.35]It's fun just to kind of pull out something and just see what happens.
[334:56.56]And you will see it again because I have plenty more of these.
[334:58.50]I've got hundreds of games that fit this exact category, so...
[335:04.10]There is a never-ending lifetime supply of old, interesting, crunchy things to see.
[335:16.71]Yeah, see you soon.
[335:17.39]See you in a couple days, probably on... What's today?
[335:22.79]I'll see you Friday.
[335:24.61]We'll do a Friday afternoon stream.
[335:26.65]Maybe Friday, Saturday.
[335:30.47]Sounds good to me.
[335:39.41]Take care of yourselves.
[335:42.17]Call your mother.
[335:42.85]And we'll see you on Friday.
