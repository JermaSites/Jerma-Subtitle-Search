[00:31.55]Oh!
[01:13.12]Hi, guys.
[01:17.72]Sorry, I'm just making a tweet.
[01:22.13]Oh, yeah.
[01:25.69]Happy Thanksgiving.
[01:26.27]Happy Black Friday.
[01:31.89]If you celebrate it.
[01:33.03]Mine was alright.
[01:33.89]I saw some family.
[01:35.29]I had a little bit of an issue, though.
[01:37.86]Not with my family.
[01:38.58]With me, myself.
[01:41.50]Good to see you, Jerma boy.
[01:42.40]How is your day going?
[01:43.08]It's going great, Grizzly.
[01:44.56]How are you doing?
[01:45.68]How's your day going?
[01:49.92]Hold on.
[01:51.46]Why is this fan on right now?
[01:53.30]Hold on.
[01:53.76]Almost ready.
[01:54.36]I'm going to write this here.
[02:00.04]Plan a coaster in a minute.
[02:02.68]In one minute.
[02:04.28]I'll be right back.
[02:14.01]Wait, what?
[02:49.66]Am I ready to go?
[02:53.89]I think so.
[02:57.05]I think I'm ready to go.
[02:59.85]The stream should be in 60 FPS today.
[03:03.34]We're going to give that a try.
[03:04.32]Hold on.
[03:07.80]What?
[03:27.07]Yeah, 60 FPS.
[03:29.31]I figured I would try to do 60 FPS just because I can do 50.
[03:33.23]I might be pushing it with 60.
[03:35.21]I don't know.
[03:39.45]This music is making me unable to talk.
[03:42.61]Anybody else like that?
[03:44.98]I'm going to take out my headphone for a second.
[03:48.84]Music like a consistent just guitar playing or a consistent drum beat makes me unable to speak.
[03:56.30]I had to take my headphones out.
[03:57.26]Now I can actually talk.
[03:58.66]Good afternoon.
[04:00.08]Good ordering.
[04:00.52]Good ordering.
[04:01.72]Hope you ordered your onion rings.
[04:03.74]Welcome to the stream.
[04:06.96]How was my Black Friday?
[04:08.50]I didn't do anything.
[04:10.84]I stayed home.
[04:13.23]I did want to buy... We'll talk about CPUs for a second.
[04:17.61]I did want to buy a... 6900.
[04:20.17]An i7 6900.
[04:22.87]At the Micro Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
[04:24.75]They were like $200 off.
[04:28.31]But I couldn't go.
[04:31.55]I do want a new computer and an i7 6900 is the CPU that I want.
[04:37.25]Bad.
[04:38.86]It's got more than four cores.
[04:40.88]The thing is a beast.
[04:42.50]So I'm going to prove to myself that I can't stream in 60.
[04:45.78]So I have to go buy one.
[04:47.04]You know what I mean?
[04:49.24]Because at some point during the stream, somebody's going to say, Jerma, this looks like shit.
[04:53.89]You can't do 60?
[04:55.19]What were you thinking?
[04:56.13]What's wrong with you?
[04:57.76]And I'll be like, fuck, they're right.
[04:59.00]I've got to go get the 6900.
[05:00.20]And a new motherboard.
[05:02.40]69 cores.
[05:08.44]Take on car hassles with 100% electric Nissan Leaf?
[05:15.19]What are you talking about?
[05:16.29]Hold on, let me read this again.
[05:19.17]Cheeseburger with 500 bits, 4x14.
[05:21.37]Says, take on car hassles with 100% electric Nissan Leaf.
[05:25.83]I'll go get a Nissan Leaf.
[05:29.83]This looks like shit already.
[05:38.18]You only need 2500 bitrate?
[05:40.96]Oh fuck it, we're going hard, man.
[05:42.56]Alright, let's make our avatar.
[05:43.68]Alright, you cannot be part of the Planet Coaster universe.
[05:47.32]Your avatar will be seen by stream friends.
[05:49.00]Oh, stream friends!
[05:50.74]And other Planet Coaster players.
[05:52.04]Alright, uh...
[05:58.03]I want his, that's what I want for his hair.
[05:59.44]Oh, this is the face.
[06:05.20]Why does every single person have to look like a creep?
[06:10.42]I want my stream friends to be able to know that I look cool.
[06:15.34]Yeah, we got a 60 FPS ting rate.
[06:18.72]Auto, look.
[06:20.96]Listen to me, dog.
[06:22.54]I'm your dad, okay?
[06:24.97]I know you want to run out of here with that chewy.
[06:28.61]Don't ask me why.
[06:29.27]I gave him a dentist stick.
[06:30.78]He's eating like a dental chewy.
[06:33.56]And he won't eat it.
[06:36.00]He just keeps looking at it and like smelling it and like throwing it in the air to himself.
[06:39.46]And he wants to leave the room.
[06:40.78]Because he wants to go run around and like hide it.
[06:42.66]It's like chew it.
[06:43.80]Your teeth are fucked up.
[06:44.86]You gotta chew that thing.
[06:45.74]You're gonna have fucked up teeth for the rest of your life.
[06:51.88]He's looking at me like fuck you.
[06:55.10]He doesn't even want to chew it.
[06:56.08]He just wants to play with it.
[06:57.08]He wants to, like, bury it somewhere.
[06:59.66]Look, the doctor told me... The veterinarian told me that you need to start having your teeth brushed.
[07:06.89]Do you want that, or do you want to chew the chewy chew?
[07:10.75]No, I just want to hold it in my mouth.
[07:13.81]And then go... By the way, in, like, three hours, you're going to, like, roll over in your bed, and there's going to be a dental chew in your mattress.
[07:24.45]You guys want to see?
[07:25.09]Hey, I'll show you.
[07:26.85]I'll show you.
[07:27.27]Oh, wait a minute.
[07:27.67]I don't think I can.
[07:29.86]Maybe I can.
[07:31.44]This is what he does.
[07:31.98]Hold on.
[07:36.96]See?
[07:37.26]He wants to get out of here so bad so he can go fucking hide this.
[07:41.93]Better not show me below the waist.
[07:44.01]That's very important.
[07:46.09]Show me below the waist?
[07:47.39]Banned.
[07:49.09]Show the dog below the waist?
[07:50.65]That's fine, apparently.
[07:53.79]Come here, so I don't have to get banned from Twitch I'm gonna like do this in a way, so I like you don't see me.
[08:03.09]Let's hope I don't get seen here Yeah, I can stream a dog naked can't stream me naked apparently Alright, okay Otto you're ready to be on camera.
[08:17.48]You're just show the world why you're such a widow oh
[08:25.55]Okay.
[08:26.57]So there you go.
[08:27.43]See?
[08:29.53]See the thing right there?
[08:30.65]Right there on the ground?
[08:33.39]He wants to... If I open that door, he's gonna grab that and sprint out of here.
[08:39.81]Oh no.
[08:40.55]Hey.
[08:41.25]Go get it.
[08:42.49]Go chew that thing.
[08:45.07]No.
[08:47.31]No, I wanna leave.
[08:49.44]No, you can't leave.
[08:51.82]But look, I'm looking at it.
[08:53.64]I'm waiting for you to let me out of the room.
[08:56.87]Hey, what are you doing?
[08:59.96]What are you doing?
[09:00.50]Get that chewy.
[09:00.82]Chew that chewy.
[09:02.32]No, I don't want to.
[09:04.30]I don't want to chew it.
[09:12.10]He just, you know what I mean?
[09:14.23]Oh, no, no.
[09:14.65]Now the camera's off.
[09:15.37]He knew the camera was on him.
[09:16.69]Come on, Trini.
[09:20.39]He fucking knew it.
[09:21.13]He was like, yeah, you're going to film me?
[09:24.63]Alright, let's pretend we're not paying attention to him.
[09:31.52]Why does he know the camera's on every time?
[09:33.60]Okay, I'm gonna, like, turn my body.
[09:37.22]I'm not paying attention.
[09:45.19]What is he doing?
[09:48.87]The second I turned the camera off, he, like, went to go put it in his mouth.
[09:52.27]Alright, auto.
[09:54.01]That's it.
[09:55.77]That's it.
[09:58.20]No, you know what it is?
[09:58.92]It's when my body turns this way.
[10:01.30]He knows I'm not looking at him.
[10:03.62]Let's make our dumb avatar of our creepy guy.
[10:10.07]He is really cute.
[10:11.03]He's such a cute dog.
[10:14.29]Does it show up on the monitor?
[10:15.69]Yeah, it does.
[10:16.69]So maybe he is seeing that.
[10:19.80]Oh, he's going to start crying.
[10:20.86]He's going to go, no, let me out.
[10:26.06]Kind of like that.
[10:28.52]Let's see here.
[10:29.02]I always have to make a guy with white hair.
[10:35.20]I never make a real me, ever.
[10:40.54]But yeah, like I was saying, get to show a naked dog, that's fine.
[10:43.40]Show a naked guy?
[10:49.01]Not fine.
[10:55.05]No, no mustache, just plain.
[10:59.18]But it's cool, though.
[10:59.86]He's real cool.
[11:07.21]It looks like when your dad goes on vacation.
[11:10.91]It's like, alright, dad.
[11:17.05]We're gonna have him have the Jerma colors, right?
[11:19.95]Yeah, he has to have the Jerma985 logo colors.
[11:25.83]Let's see, let's see.
[11:30.65]There we go.
[11:30.97]Okay, here we go.
[11:32.39]We have our Jerma985 character.
[11:37.27]And... Alright, well he has to have that.
[11:44.27]Alright, that whole process... Wait, is that spaghetti on his hat?
[11:46.55]He can wear a spaghetti hat?
[11:47.87]Oh no, it's a gold medal.
[11:49.00]No, we're gonna... That's too predictable though, isn't it?
[11:56.30]The pirate hat is just... Alright, fine.
[12:00.01]Did I miss anything?
[12:00.71]Teen.
[12:02.17]No, he's an adult.
[12:04.56]Oh, and I can make a fat guy too.
[12:05.88]God damn it.
[12:06.42]Start over.
[12:07.56]Of course, of course I can make a fat guy.
[12:13.74]Unfortunately for me.
[12:16.52]This one.
[12:20.56]I like this one the best.
[12:22.90]This is a bigger face, but this one looks funnier.
[12:25.06]Oh, we're doing that one.
[12:31.35]No.
[12:33.17]Shit, now I have to, like, rip.
[12:34.08]Why does the fat guy only get two shirts?
[12:37.22]Doesn't that seem a little weird?
[12:39.78]Fat guy, two shirts.
[12:41.24]Skinny guy, 15.
[12:41.80]I don't know about that.
[12:49.24]Yeah, that's fine.
[12:55.36]Doesn't even look the right colors, but who cares?
[12:57.32]He's not even a real face.
[12:59.38]He is kind of a real fat guy.
[13:03.27]Shirts that only fit him.
[13:04.41]Alright, accept.
[13:06.21]For a fat guy, you can move.
[13:08.39]Alright, place your avatar headquarters.
[13:14.29]What does this mean?
[13:16.63]The HQ is where other players will see your avatar and access any parks or blueprints you have shared.
[13:22.67]Anywhere on the globe.
[13:24.65]Well, I mean... Might as well put it like Google Maps it.
[13:29.53]This is where I live, right?
[13:32.32]No, I don't want you guys to know where I, like, live.
[13:34.46]I don't want you guys to know my address.
[13:35.94]We're going to, like, South America.
[13:39.44]Oh, wait.
[13:39.88]This might be, like, a latency thing, huh?
[13:42.16]Yeah.
[13:42.68]Alright.
[13:43.06]Fine.
[13:44.68]Wait.
[13:44.82]What?
[13:45.44]Wait, wait, wait.
[13:46.80]Right there.
[13:48.86]Are you sure?
[13:50.15]Yes.
[13:51.53]What if it landed on my exact address?
[13:59.57]Oh.
[14:02.71]Alright, let's do a... So I have no idea how to play this game at all.
[14:07.88]Not a single clue.
[14:09.62]You probably joined the shittiest stream you could have joined watching Planet Coaster because I don't know what I'm doing.
[14:15.42]Should I just go and learn as we go?
[14:17.54]Should we do like the easy career mode thing first?
[14:25.29]Oh, by the way, thank you, Johan.
[14:29.69]Thank you, Johannes, for the 1,000 bits.
[14:31.55]Appreciate it, dude.

[15:52.29]And Waffle Stacks, Bala Magician.
[15:57.46]The Magician, thanks for subscribing.

[16:21.70]Oh, a thousand bits from ImpDude2.
[16:23.66]Rent-A-Cat, thanks for the bits.
[16:26.96]Let's get going.
[16:27.94]Let's just do... I'm gonna do career.
[16:29.04]We're just gonna try... We're gonna do Captain Lockjaw's Buried Shit.
[16:32.83]Beginner.
[16:35.92]That's kind of cool looking.
[16:37.76]I'm gonna take my time with this.
[16:39.18]I don't want to... fuck anything up.
[16:41.72]I want to read, I want to make sure I know what I'm doing.
[16:44.10]So this is gonna be real boring.
[16:46.60]Right off the bat, I'm gonna say it.
[16:48.60]This stream sucks.
[16:50.16]This stream is not gonna be good.
[16:53.18]Terrible fucking stream.
[16:54.60]Awful stream.
[16:56.28]So if you're into that, if you're into the worst stream I've ever done behind Karazhan, here it is.
[17:03.25]Because we're just going to relax and play Planet Coaster.
[17:06.93]I'm not going to try to kill anybody.
[17:09.58]Well, that last part's not necessarily true.
[17:14.50]But here we go.
[17:15.78]Start a new scenario.
[17:17.10]Pirate Battle.
[17:19.48]Creature Awakens.
[17:20.30]I can pick one of these.
[17:20.92]Let's do Creature Awakens.
[17:25.93]Rumors of engineers meeting sticky... This fucking music.
[17:32.75]I can't even hear myself think.
[17:34.33]Let's do it.
[17:34.75]I don't even know how to play Save Road.
[17:37.35]Sticky ends.
[18:04.15]No, I'm sure the music is great, but I'm a moron.
[18:08.53]And have all kinds of odd awareness problems.
[18:11.31]So if there's like music or like sounds in my head when I'm trying to speak, it's... Alright, let's continue.
[18:19.50]So here we go.
[18:21.90]It's kind of cool.
[18:22.50]It's like Cthulhu.
[18:24.26]Alright.
[18:25.46]So, first things first.
[18:27.21]From every one of these games, we define like the entrance.
[18:30.11]I guess these are the controls.
[18:33.12]Does the control pretty much like the last, um, Rollercoaster Tycoon games?
[18:42.18]Because if it's similar, I played a lot of Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, so I kind of, like, understand what's going on.
[18:48.49]There's a lot of litter in the park.
[18:49.71]Make sure they're in okay.
[18:50.47]I gotta, like, hire some people.
[18:54.80]Already, though, this is interesting already because it's just Rollercoaster icon.
[18:59.78]Alright.
[19:02.54]Oh, sorry.
[19:02.88]We're going to make this park car two janitors.
[19:05.96]I'm assuming that's in park management.
[19:10.97]Can't move that, huh?
[19:13.27]Can't move any of this.
[19:16.73]Well, knock a couple of points off, guys.
[19:22.30]Yeah, knock off like 0.2 points.
[19:24.70]Can't like drag this shit around.
[19:27.54]Alright.
[19:28.90]Well.
[19:31.15]Oh, basic controls.
[19:32.15]Here we go.
[19:33.75]Select an item in the park to view its info panel and management options.
[19:36.31]Open the menus at the bottom of the screen to start building things.
[19:38.59]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:39.51]That's what I'm talking about.
[19:41.29]Select is left click.
[19:42.58]Cancel, close, or deselect is escape.
[19:45.48]Pan, I had that.
[19:46.42]Zoom, yep.
[19:47.72]Rotate, that's what I was doing.
[19:48.86]Undo, control.
[19:49.48]Oh, there's actually an undo.
[19:51.86]So, you don't have to resell things.
[19:55.18]Park entry is free!
[19:57.34]Hold on just a second.
[19:58.47]Uh, excuse me.
[19:59.77]Park entry is not free.
[20:01.55]It's 50 bucks.
[20:03.53]Did you talk about this place is like bleeding money?
[20:05.35]I think I found the problem.
[20:08.17]I gotta charge these people.
[20:10.66]Simulation speed, uh, yeah, you can go faster than.
[20:12.72]Remember that.
[20:14.58]Save.
[20:14.96]Park menu.
[20:15.58]F5.
[20:16.78]F1 is help.
[20:18.72]P is pause.
[20:19.58]Free look is T.
[20:22.31]Shift E. E and Q is lowering the camera.
[20:25.45]Okay, I think I got it.
[20:28.02]So let's go ahead and open up the staff menu.
[20:30.04]We need, what, two janitors?
[20:33.64]Oh, the janitor is the coolest character.
[20:36.46]And I can place him... Where's, like, the dirtiest part of the park?
[20:43.67]Oh, let's put him, like, right here.
[20:48.15]Okay, now can't you, like, make them do a path?
[20:53.55]That's something that you can actually do well.
[20:55.87]This is holy shit.
[20:56.53]This is a dirty part.
[20:59.17]Oh my God People just like drink this so doesn't throw them on the ground There are trash cans everywhere.
[21:08.17]I'd again.
[21:08.51]We need like more than one janitor.
[21:11.25]It's happy.
[21:13.20]It's a trainee Alright alright
[21:20.56]Wait, you did the tutorial?
[21:21.82]Let's stop fucking drowning people.
[21:25.92]Ah, okay.
[21:26.64]We did it.
[21:27.06]We did the... I'm just kidding.
[21:30.10]Like that quickly, I just lose all interest.
[21:33.30]Alright, what's the... Where's the pick up person button and throw them into the pit?
[21:38.38]I need another janitor, right?
[21:39.41]Two janitors.
[21:44.45]He's currently working that way, so... I'm going to put him...
[21:50.66]That's kind of interesting.
[21:52.06]It goes all the way down there.
[21:52.88]Where the hell does that even go?
[21:58.35]I need to know, right?
[21:59.89]Sometimes you just need to know.
[22:03.49]What the fuck?
[22:07.79]No, I can't.
[22:09.47]No, I can't put him there either.
[22:13.83]Okay, I don't want to have my first two staff members just to get lost.
[22:19.85]Make a roller coaster that goes into the pit.
[22:22.33]Baby steps.
[22:23.09]Baby steps.
[22:27.06]Alright, what's the next thing I gotta do?
[22:28.36]I'm just learning how to play the game.
[22:29.54]Build two rides.
[22:31.98]Hire two mechanics.
[22:32.76]Build 5k.
[22:33.40]Build two rides.
[22:34.04]Let's see what we got for rides.
[22:35.90]Coasters.
[22:36.46]Track rides.
[22:37.12]Rides.
[22:37.90]Scenery.
[22:38.46]Rides.
[22:40.16]I'm gonna do a sandbox after this.
[22:41.98]I just want to learn where everything is.
[22:45.66]And all that shit, you know?
[22:48.10]Whirly gig?
[22:48.94]Ah, that thing sucks.
[22:50.44]Rock top, rock topicus?
[22:51.72]No, that thing's dumb.
[22:53.02]Psycho, no, stupid.
[22:54.38]Kickflip.
[22:55.56]Oh, yeah.
[22:58.08]I remember when I was 12, I puked on the kickflip.
[23:00.80]Hell, it's a special place in my heart.
[23:03.72]Okay, let's see.
[23:04.68]Ride placement controls.
[23:08.80]Yep.
[23:09.77]Yep.
[23:10.71]Rotate is Z plus?
[23:13.29]Oh, okay, I get you, I get you.
[23:14.45]Cool.
[23:16.88]Alright.
[23:17.48]Rotate 90 degrees.
[23:18.26]You can just do it easily like that.
[23:19.78]Cool.
[23:20.34]Raise or lower.
[23:21.18]Shift.
[23:22.88]Oh, man.
[23:23.40]Oh, fuck.
[23:28.79]Alright.
[23:29.15]Okay.
[23:29.93]We have that ride up there.
[23:32.39]Now I just need to make a path.
[23:36.59]Let's make a path to this ride.
[23:37.99]I didn't mean to necessarily do that.
[23:40.80]I was still learning the controls.
[23:41.88]Alright.
[23:43.68]Uh-huh.
[23:47.39]Easy now.
[23:50.11]It's the entrance.
[23:52.11]Place an exit right here.
[23:55.07]I'm going to connect entrance to path.
[23:59.23]Okay.
[24:00.82]Let me read this.
[24:04.72]Baby steps.
[24:09.42]It's going to work.
[24:12.32]Look, I'm learning the controls.
[24:15.33]You must be at least 20 feet tall.
[24:17.13]No, this is like 300 feet tall.
[24:21.39]None of this matters.
[24:22.21]This isn't real.
[24:24.59]Our little, like, fucking dog tail waggling around.
[24:26.83]Doesn't matter.
[24:27.39]Don't worry.
[24:27.83]Alright.
[24:28.93]Place path.
[24:29.41]Delete path.
[24:29.93]Yeah.
[24:30.23]Raise lower.
[24:33.57]Shift plus... Shift plus what?
[24:37.55]Show more controls.
[24:38.61]Raise path, U. Lower path, J. Of course, J... J is take screenshot for me.
[24:48.40]Can't wait to have like a hundred screenshots of this.
[24:56.44]This is such a steep climb.
[25:00.41]Is that as low as it can go?
[25:03.25]I think that's as low as it could possibly go.
[25:06.63]Yeah.
[25:12.34]I'm going to make it to the end of the part.
[25:14.14]Okay.
[25:15.40]U. Yeah, U. Alright.
[25:20.98]Now, can I hold the button down to make this... This is like a water park ride.
[25:29.50]Rotate junctions.
[25:30.80]C. Okay.
[25:31.81]That's cool.
[25:32.93]Z.
[25:35.34]What about placing multiple paths?
[25:36.98]Adjust height.
[25:38.06]Shift.
[25:40.18]Angle.
[25:40.52]Snap.
[25:41.36]Decrease length.
[25:42.22]Increase length.
[25:43.10]Decrease width.
[25:46.86]Okay.
[25:51.37]Equals.
[25:54.11]Alright.
[25:54.53]Interesting.
[26:00.41]Yeah.
[26:04.68]Alright.
[26:05.62]No, no, no.
[26:06.06]Control Z. Alright, here we go.
[26:11.95]Congratulations, you just got a star.
[26:17.39]Alright, now I need the exit.
[26:22.49]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[26:23.79]What the fuck am I doing?
[26:25.69]I need the exit now.
[26:27.23]Wait, should I just have... No, have no exit?
[26:28.87]Just have everybody have to stand up here?
[26:31.51]Put food stands all over it?
[26:35.96]Let me open the ride.
[26:36.88]Let's see what happens.
[26:38.78]How do I get out of here?
[26:40.12]Alright, open the ride.
[26:43.16]It's open.
[26:43.94]Open for details.
[26:47.23]It is $10, not $9.
[26:50.53]Sorry.
[26:52.35]And look at this.
[26:52.77]We already got people enjoying our theme park.
[26:58.83]We already have a... Look.
[27:01.34]These people are flocking to our new ride.
[27:03.36]The Super Psycho Laworly game.
[27:05.42]What is this thing called?
[27:09.09]Let's watch.
[27:10.59]Where's our time button?
[27:12.49]Isn't it O?
[27:14.13]Yeah, O. See?
[27:18.49]Look at how fucking popular this is.
[27:22.30]Ten bucks.
[27:22.88]And we were talking about the park being in trouble.
[27:26.96]You thought the park was in trouble.
[27:30.51]People just have to ascend the stairway to heaven to get there.
[27:32.97]Oh my god, this is so long.
[27:39.53]A whole day has gone by.
[27:42.71]These people have been walking an entire day.
[27:48.91]Alright, come on in!
[27:50.88]Enjoy the park!
[27:52.52]It's only $10!
[27:52.94]Look at how excited everybody is.
[27:57.14]Can I ride this too?
[28:00.07]Yeah!
[28:01.45]I can do it.
[28:02.25]I'm gonna get in the seat.
[28:05.45]Look at how happy everybody is.
[28:13.78]Oh, God.
[28:15.72]Okay, hold on.
[28:16.30]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[28:17.64]Get out of this.
[28:18.98]I'm gonna fucking puke if I keep looking at that.
[28:22.06]Get me out of this.
[28:25.01]Yeah, I didn't build an exit.
[28:28.00]Is that a bad thing?
[28:28.74]That people are just going to stay up here?
[28:30.92]Alright, they're done with that ride.
[28:34.60]Nope.
[28:38.45]These are the only people that got here.
[28:40.55]Is nobody else getting in line?
[28:43.15]No, no, they're coming.
[28:47.25]They're not just going to drop off, are they?
[28:50.81]You took all this time, you paid $10, you walked up here.
[28:53.08]You're not just going to walk out.
[28:57.36]Right?
[29:04.17]What the fuck is happening to them?
[29:07.38]What?
[29:07.70]Are they on the ground?
[29:14.56]No, these are just birds Where did those people go?
[29:34.34]I don't understand.
[29:35.16]Can I just angle it?
[29:37.24]No.
[29:41.34]Alright, what happens if they get to here?
[29:45.85]I need to know.
[29:47.93]So now there's an exit.
[29:54.55]Did they fall again?
[29:55.39]It didn't tell me anybody died.
[29:58.41]The park entrance is not accessible.
[30:01.25]Right?
[30:02.01]Important.
[30:03.73]For some reason, I feel like that's pretty important.
[30:07.57]So now that there's an exit, are they going to disappear again?
[30:13.18]Well, they seem to be very excited about it.
[30:18.54]Are they happy that I built the path?
[30:19.94]Or are they just happy that they're off the ride?
[30:21.42]These people are, like, stuck in a loop.
[30:27.89]Yeah, that was so much fun!
[30:29.39]I can't believe it.
[30:30.11]Is this whole park going to get stuck here?
[30:36.93]Uh... Time to leave, help me.
[30:43.13]There's nowhere for me to go, oh no, help me!
[30:46.48]That's not the face of help me.
[30:49.88]I'm stuck, help me!
[30:51.96]I'm having so much fun being stuck!
[30:54.42]Help!
[30:57.07]Oh no, this is them, this is them saying help me!
[30:58.85]I thought they were doing like, having like a party!
[31:01.09]This is like, this is having a party!
[31:02.47]This is not I'm stuck!
[31:07.44]They were like, wicked happy to get off the ride.
[31:09.40]Like, yeah, look, we're having a fucking rocking party.
[31:18.84]It's so much fun.
[31:26.45]Okay.
[31:27.51]Alright.
[31:29.11]Let's finish this so we don't have a help party up here.
[31:34.21]Is it on times three speed still?
[31:35.75]No, it isn't.
[31:39.01]It was on x2 speed.
[31:43.92]Okay, now this does not seem like a party anymore.
[31:46.78]No, because it was on x2 speed.
[31:49.36]Look, okay, so for x1 speed, help me.
[31:52.20]x2 speed, yeah!
[31:55.52]This is sick!
[31:57.60]x3 speed, this is like the best place I've ever been to.
[32:00.58]x1 speed, god help us!
[32:11.93]Problem solved.
[32:21.70]Get a couple screenshots.
[32:26.54]Hold on.
[32:28.50]Give me a minute.
[32:34.64]I gotta change that from J.
[32:41.56]Is that gonna hit this?
[32:43.23]Look at this.
[32:43.61]I'm just doing this.
[32:44.55]None of this even matters, guys.
[32:45.55]I'm just doing the tutorial.
[32:50.71]Look, it's gonna be fine.
[32:52.79]Everybody's freaking out for no reason.
[32:54.01]This is not even the real game yet.
[32:55.89]See?
[32:56.64]Now people are gonna be fine.
[33:00.32]Don't worry.
[33:01.04]Now they can leave.
[33:02.18]It just takes them about three days to go to leave.
[33:05.52]Not a big deal.
[33:07.54]Took you three days to come up.
[33:08.78]Hey, look, the ride back is gonna be faster.
[33:10.16]If you, like, start running here, it was three days to come up.
[33:14.10]It's gonna be, like, a day and a half to go down, especially if you fall.
[33:18.18]Probably less than a day.
[33:20.03]Not gonna guarantee your safety, but you're gonna get down.
[33:26.37]Dude, they're fine.
[33:27.01]Alright, what's the next thing?
[33:27.91]Build two rides and build a second ride.
[33:33.01]Alright, so here's the funny thing.
[33:34.23]Those people that are just coming into the stream right now, that's a rollercoaster.
[33:39.06]Yeah.
[33:39.44]All I have to do to make myself not look like an idiot is just to say, yeah, there's our coaster there.
[33:43.40]It's a pretty simple coaster.
[33:45.46]It goes up.
[33:45.98]Then they go, whoa!
[33:50.20]So, if you're just joining the stream right now, pretty sick coaster.
[33:52.29]Alright, let's keep going.
[33:53.99]Just don't ever zoom in again.
[33:55.41]So they don't know that I'm a fucking fraud.
[33:57.09]Alright, next ride.
[34:01.39]You can do research, right?
[34:02.59]I don't want to do the Whirlygig.
[34:06.29]What's the cheapest thing I can possibly do?
[34:08.27]The Whirlygig.
[34:11.06]Okay, just don't zoom in.
[34:14.04]I can zoom in, but it's gotta be like this.
[34:20.96]Obviously this looks like I need to place it here.
[34:22.40]Is that good?
[34:27.82]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:29.00]Let's make it like that.
[34:32.76]There.
[34:34.44]Place an entrance.
[34:36.74]Place an entrance.
[34:37.62]Place an insurance.
[34:38.60]Get some insurance.
[34:43.39]Let's go ahead and get some insurance here.
[34:44.83]What the fuck?
[34:52.01]Does it have to be like a queue line?
[34:57.08]A blue queue path.
[34:57.88]Okay, well... What do you mean it's obstructed?
[35:01.76]Obstructed by what?
[35:06.24]What the fuck is this?
[35:06.96]Oh, it's like attendance?
[35:10.56]Oh.
[35:12.27]Get out of here.
[35:15.09]Why can I not do this?
[35:17.55]Did I do something wrong here?
[35:19.73]I thought any path could be connected.
[35:23.54]Don't tell me there's a little piece of dirt in the way.
[35:30.62]This is the exit, so it can't be a queue.
[35:32.16]No, this is the entrance right here.
[35:35.91]Regular path?
[35:37.09]I thought that's what I was doing.
[35:39.77]A grey queue path.
[35:45.97]Oh, okay.
[35:46.51]It has to be just... It can't be.
[35:47.84]It's not a cue path.
[35:49.14]Alright.
[35:50.12]There we go.
[35:50.54]That one's done.
[35:51.14]Don't even need to test it.
[35:51.96]Who gives a shit about safety problems?
[35:54.20]Who cares?
[35:55.14]Just get in the Donkey Kong Country barrels and spin around.
[35:59.30]No, it's because you're bad.
[36:02.26]Oh, okay.
[36:03.94]I just wanted to make sure.
[36:04.82]Look, we're learning the game.
[36:05.47]I've never played this game before.
[36:07.23]Alright, well, whatever.
[36:12.73]Alright, there's two rides.
[36:15.03]End of the month profit made 827,000 bits.
[36:17.45]Mm-hmm.
[36:23.50]That's a lot of bits.
[36:26.04]Alright, two rides.
[36:28.50]Two mechanics.
[36:31.14]That was down here.
[36:32.08]I feel like I'm going to really like this game.
[36:36.51]It reminds me a lot of Rollercoaster Tycoon 3.
[36:38.99]Which makes sense because it's Frontier.
[36:41.82]And Frontier is a pretty cool company.
[36:44.34]They make some pretty cool stuff.
[36:47.50]I mean, just place them anywhere.
[36:48.40]It doesn't matter.
[36:48.90]Now, did it used to... Didn't you used to have to hire people and sometimes they were, like, shitty at their job?
[36:57.16]Can we donate bits to your park?
[37:04.04]If you want to.
[37:06.85]That's two.
[37:07.49]Alright.
[37:08.71]I think after this we can move on.
[37:10.55]Employment.
[37:13.30]Alright.
[37:13.86]$290 a month.
[37:14.26]Holy shit.
[37:15.58]He should be getting paid way more than that, right?
[37:19.22]He's just getting paid like $1.12 an hour.
[37:23.46]Okay.
[37:23.76]I don't know what world we're living in, but that's not minimum wage.
[37:29.41]Alright, what's next?
[37:32.65]Five rides, two entertainers, and attract a thousand guests.
[37:35.71]Alright, I think I got it.
[37:36.97]I got the tutorial done.
[37:39.69]Look, people are loving the rides.
[37:41.91]We're going to be fine.
[37:43.28]Let's actually open up a sandbox and let's make the Wonder Zone.
[37:48.82]Put in the cookie cup.
[37:49.96]I got it.
[37:51.14]Let's do it.
[37:51.50]I'm not going to save this shit.
[37:54.32]Don't even need to.
[37:56.37]Exit to main menu.
[37:57.07]Yes.
[37:57.99]Yes.
[38:00.34]Hey, that's not a rollercoaster.
[38:01.48]This guy sucks.
[38:03.94]Alright, I'm gonna play.
[38:05.46]We're just gonna do sandbox.
[38:06.24]We're gonna start our own park.
[38:07.44]Make our own rules.
[38:08.10]I just want to do that to learn.
[38:11.76]So... Where do you guys want to go?
[38:15.55]Tropical?
[38:16.01]Desert?
[38:16.57]Grassland?
[38:19.73]Inconspicuous?
[38:22.01]Or Alpine?
[38:24.77]Are you guys ready to make the Wonder Zone?
[38:27.61]Come on, Tim.
[38:28.23]If we grind down the exit, we'll be back home by tomorrow.
[38:35.66]Challenge mode isn't infinite money.
[38:37.00]Well, sandbox is, right?
[38:41.04]Fleshlight will let you imagine you're free to build your dream with no restrictions.
[38:44.78]That's what we want, right?
[38:47.79]Manage your money.
[38:50.25]What would you guys rather see?
[38:51.39]Me just make whatever the fuck I want or try to actually play this game?
[38:59.22]No, fuck it.
[38:59.86]I don't want no money constraints.
[39:03.86]I don't want to go to deciduous.
[39:04.96]I'm going to grassland.
[39:07.00]Paul, no.
[39:07.60]Do you want to do a poll for this?
[39:10.98]Alright, fine.
[39:12.02]We'll do a poll for this stupid thing.
[39:15.55]Tropical, desert, grassland, alpine, or deciduous.

[43:27.52]It has to be Wonder Zone.
[43:30.48]Frisky Moose, thanks for the 2,500 bits.

[43:57.62]Paths, we're gonna make our path here.
[43:58.82]We're gonna do it very, very easily.
[44:00.24]I'm not gonna be one of those people that spends like 30 fucking minutes making their paths.
[44:05.76]I'll show you how we do it here on this channel.
[44:07.32]1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 1... 2... 1... 2...

[45:08.39]Okay?
[45:11.64]This could have taken me all day.
[45:13.14]Instead, it took me- it took me- it took me- I made a snail!
[45:16.28]I made a snail.
[45:17.24]Perfect.
[45:18.06]It's a perfect snail.
[45:20.42]And you thought I wasn't trying to do that.
[45:21.84]This is going to be a snail-themed park.
[45:23.54]The Wonder Zone.
[45:26.76]How many- how much time?
[45:27.38]What have I got for time?
[45:31.90]That was a good- that was a good time.
[45:35.45]Alright.
[45:35.69]First of all, we have- we're going to have a couple of- Very important.
[45:39.87]This park is not free.
[45:43.60]Park entrance gate.
[45:45.16]Standard.
[45:45.72]Okay.
[45:45.98]Ticket prices.
[45:46.66]Family price.

[45:53.32]It's gonna be fucking like a hundred bucks.
[45:54.76]No.

[45:59.38]What is the six flags price is what?
[46:01.60]Like $35 for a day?
[46:03.64]Family discount?

[46:24.95]$45.99.
[46:27.53]How much was the price of this game?
[46:29.51]Alright, the price of the game was $44.99.
[46:32.90]That's how much it takes to get into the park.
[46:34.08]You have to buy Planet Coaster.
[46:38.62]Family Dock, $28.
[46:39.30]Are you kidding me?
[46:42.63]Alright, so the family price is going to be what this game is going to be on Steam sale.
[46:47.03]Planet Coaster on Steam sale is going to be like 25% off.
[46:48.87]What's 25% minus $44.99?

[48:07.66]And then you're gonna... Right when you get up here, you're gonna go... It's a perfect fucking opening.
[48:18.71]Yeah, that's gonna be excitement.
[48:20.05]My excitement level is gonna be like times 10.
[48:21.51]Alright, uh...
[48:28.06]fighting squad it's just a blast what else do we want to do that's the scenery let me just take a look at they got a canvas of a cannon oh there's also a cannon pointing out yeah look out for this one no fuck that that's stupid
[48:56.48]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[48:58.78]That would have been funny like five minutes ago.
[49:06.32]Jesus Christ.
[49:08.11]No.
[49:09.69]Fueling station?
[49:12.31]Like for a car?
[49:13.05]No, I don't want to do that.
[49:19.67]A fairy tale called the King's Gold.
[49:22.15]And this stays with our theme.
[49:25.59]There's gonna be a king's gold statue at every corner.
[49:35.61]Can I have, like, audio cues when they walk by so it's like... Welcome to my extravagancy.
[49:42.88]I don't even know what he's gonna say.
[49:44.28]Is that too many gold statues, you think?
[49:48.40]At this one intersection, this first intersection you come in.
[49:55.87]Uh, there's a fruit stand.
[49:59.65]No, that doesn't play into our medieval fantasy theme.
[50:03.07]The princess, though.
[50:05.96]Uh, no.
[50:11.10]Locomotive track.
[50:12.02]There's a lot of shit here.
[50:12.98]This game is cool.
[50:16.20]I'll check out this one.
[50:18.18]Laser scanner.
[50:19.02]Yeah, alright.
[50:19.62]So you have to go through the laser scanner.
[50:23.92]To make sure you don't have any, like, weapons.
[50:29.87]We need to make sure you don't have, like, you don't have your keys still on you.
[50:34.59]This is for security purposes.
[50:38.80]No, it doesn't fit with our theme.
[50:39.74]Alright, we'll figure that out later.
[50:42.70]Let's make some rides.
[50:45.48]Jesus.
[50:50.23]What if somebody brings a katana into the park?
[50:52.87]I'm going to have to have a scanner at some point.
[50:54.81]Oh, alright.
[50:55.31]The Screaminator.
[50:56.09]Should we go with the old-fashioned whirly gig?
[51:03.54]It fits well with the medieval snail theme.
[51:11.26]Where are the medieval rides?
[51:14.76]Gears of Fear?
[51:17.02]Is that medieval?
[51:19.67]That's kind of medieval.
[51:21.57]No, that's like steampunk.
[51:22.61]It doesn't fit with our theme.
[51:23.48]Maybe this is that.
[51:27.60]Maybe this is this.
[51:31.38]Maybe this is that.
[51:34.26]None of these fit with the theme.
[51:35.10]They can't be in it.
[51:35.68]Alright, we're going to do shops first.
[51:40.83]I don't know, man.
[51:41.63]Like, Witcher 3 is one of those games that I know is... Well, this fits with our theme perfectly.
[51:44.35]Witcher 3 is one of those games that I know is super fun and awesome and... What the fuck did that thing just say?
[52:14.79]These are too big.
[52:18.51]Who's saying fantastic?
[52:20.75]No, these are terrible.
[52:21.58]Get these out of here.
[52:23.50]How many times am I going to say um?
[52:26.18]Let's see.
[52:26.50]Oh, it's a hat shop.
[52:30.34]I thought that was scenery.
[52:33.26]Oh, definitely going to have Bozo the Clown.
[52:34.84]Are you serious?
[52:35.96]That's the first attraction.
[52:38.81]I don't want you to miss it, so it's going to be right here.
[52:40.77]This is so big.
[52:46.39]No, a ride has to go there.
[52:47.97]Why is Bozo the Clown so huge?
[52:53.87]Can I, like, make this smaller?
[52:55.17]I don't think so.
[52:58.18]Whatever.
[52:58.52]Maybe, like, right there.
[53:02.72]Bozo the Clown.
[53:03.48]What do they sell at Bozo the Clown?
[53:09.23]What is this?
[53:17.10]What is this thing?
[53:21.51]Does it do anything?
[53:22.39]This is $460.
[53:25.55]What do they sell at Bozo the Clown?
[53:31.06]Okay.
[53:36.95]It's a bathroom?
[53:38.01]Is it really?
[53:38.63]Yeah, it's a jester.
[53:41.99]But to answer your question, Witcher 3 is something I probably will never play on stream.
[53:50.26]Just because I have the patience of a squirrel and I have the mind of a small rabbit.
[54:00.32]So I can't... It's so hard for me to sit there and do... Okay, that just scared me.
[54:04.46]I just fucking got jump scared by that sun change.
[54:09.49]Witcher 3, isn't Witcher 3 like 300 hours long to get the full experience?
[54:14.71]I feel like I'd get 10 to 20 hours into it and just... I wouldn't get bored playing it, I would get bored streaming it.
[54:21.74]If that makes any sense.
[54:26.02]Alright, we got our clown burger store.
[54:27.73]Ooh, okay.
[54:31.89]No, I want like a...
[54:33.79]First Aid.
[54:34.45]Okay, this is a gift shop.
[54:35.87]Bozo the Clown.
[54:37.79]We need some food.
[54:39.99]Okay, food shops.
[54:41.59]Pirate food.
[54:42.53]Pirate stall.
[54:45.35]There's a lot of pirate themed shit here.
[54:50.31]Fairytale Village food kiosk.
[54:51.73]There we go.
[54:54.03]Hey, do you want to make a pirate theme park or a medieval theme park?
[54:57.01]We got you covered.
[55:04.25]Okay, what else can I do here?
[55:05.99]Middle East burger store.
[55:08.21]This one.
[55:10.05]I can't even tell.
[55:11.39]Do they have, like, Middle Eastern themed things?
[55:15.82]I'm all for it, man.
[55:16.60]I'm all for everything.
[55:18.34]But, is it?
[55:19.30]What the fuck is going on?
[55:20.98]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[55:22.38]Easy, easy.
[55:24.76]Easy.
[55:25.64]It's like some mass deleting shit.
[55:29.04]Clown theme park.
[55:30.04]I can make how much this shit costs.
[55:31.82]Alright, items for sale.
[55:34.14]$12 for a burger.
[55:37.04]Extras.
[55:39.46]You get everything on it.
[55:42.38]The Chief Burger... The Chief Burger XL has got everything on it.
[55:46.15]The regular Chief Burger?
[55:48.11]Sorry.
[55:49.57]That shit costs extra.
[55:51.03]That's what the difference.
[55:52.61]Right?
[55:52.79]Alright.
[55:55.23]No, you don't even get cheese on this one.
[55:56.73]Fuck you.
[56:01.58]You just get two patties, two buns and a patty.
[56:06.61]That's called bait-and-switch marketing, ladies and gentlemen.
[56:08.81]That's how you do it.
[56:09.53]You show them an item that they actually want, and that's the one that they're going to buy.
[56:13.63]And then the other item that's the more affordable one ain't the one that they wanted in the first place.
[56:19.81]That's called the bait-and-switch marketing technique.
[56:23.23]And that's open.
[56:25.73]Food, I need drinks now.
[56:26.93]We'll do two food stalls.
[56:30.17]And another fairy tale village food stall.
[56:34.47]This one doesn't need to be here.
[56:35.61]We'll put this one right at the head of the snail.
[56:40.58]Right there.
[56:43.20]We can expand.
[56:45.20]We can expand our park eventually here.
[56:46.74]Don't worry, guys.
[56:49.96]Okay, so are these all connected to one?
[56:55.79]Chief beef six.
[56:59.01]Cheap beef 7, okay.
[57:01.07]So they're not connected.
[57:03.73]They are not connected.
[57:04.83]Is there a way to make it so that everything I do is the same across the board?
[57:12.51]How do I do that?
[57:13.91]I know you can.
[57:16.73]Can I just copy this?
[57:22.31]Probably, but...
[57:24.26]I'm not entirely sure how.
[57:26.75]Edit building.
[57:27.43]Save as blueprint.
[57:29.01]Move.
[57:29.63]Toggle advanced.
[57:30.63]Duplicate.
[57:31.03]There it is.
[57:31.33]Okay.
[57:32.97]Control D. People are going to call me a clicker, aren't they?
[57:40.32]No roller coaster.
[57:41.00]The park sucks.
[57:41.58]Don't.
[57:41.94]You bet.
[57:42.24]You just wait.
[57:43.38]I'm going to make the most intense coaster you've ever seen.
[57:47.46]That's good for food.
[57:48.04]Let's get some drinks in here.
[57:51.64]Let's have you drink a bunch of milk before you get on a roller coaster.
[57:56.10]That sounds like a good idea.
[57:57.28]We're gonna have enough room for people to sit down.
[58:05.32]Strawberry cosmic shake, vanilla cosmic shake.
[58:07.29]Oh, these are milkshakes.
[58:08.89]Perfect.
[58:10.51]Burgers and milkshakes before you get on my rides.
[58:13.97]You're gonna be fucked.
[58:17.95]Fair enough, Jerma.
[58:19.93]Baby, I can understand how that can get boring to stream.
[58:22.77]I had the idea of doing it off and on, not as a full playthrough.
[58:26.79]Also, as a side note, any ETO when you are uploading all the sorcery streams and the two stream rumbles.
[58:32.74]The sorcery stuff is going to get uploaded here.
[58:36.62]It's going to be like a Twitch upload.
[58:39.84]I only say that because people say, well, why don't you just put it on the second channel?
[58:44.02]I don't know.
[58:45.08]I'd like to have the sorcery thing be permanent here.
[58:50.23]Use the scenery tool to connect the buildings.
[58:51.83]Okay, thanks for the tip there.
[58:54.19]Yeah, it's going to be up on here.
[58:55.53]Because Twitch allows you to do uploads, and I kind of want to see how good it is.
[58:59.76]I feel like that's a good test to upload two or three hour-long stuff.
[59:03.06]You know what I'm saying?
[59:06.78]And the two rumbles will be on the second channel eventually.
[59:09.44]Eventually.
[59:11.07]They just have to get broken down.
[59:12.43]And I'm kind of on this like upload weird schedule with the second channel where I don't want it to be just old shit from like a year ago.
[59:21.14]And I also don't want it to be like all the every new thing.
[59:24.02]I'd like to kind of have a balance in between.
[59:28.50]But yes, it will be on the second channel eventually within the next month or two, I would assume.
[59:34.07]And it's currently here to watch for two months.
[59:36.29]So if you want to watch it again, it's there.
[59:41.21]But for the time being, fuck me.
[59:43.51]No, I'm doing this right.
[59:45.19]Control D. See?
[59:47.43]I'm not an idiot.
[59:49.89]I guess I thought I was an idiot.
[59:51.43]I'm just an idiot sometimes.
[59:55.35]That's fine.
[59:55.96]Who cares about marshmallows?
[59:57.42]Wait, $5, $5.
[59:58.88]Strawberry, vanilla, chocolate.
[60:01.26]Yeah, that's fine.
[60:01.98]$5 each.
[60:02.92]Who cares?
[60:04.34]We can do that another time.
[60:05.52]Don't have to do it now.
[60:07.94]Alright, let's do a coaster.
[60:11.18]This one's going to be back here.
[60:19.42]Dimension.
[60:20.82]Oh, Blueprint Custom.
[60:21.54]Okay.
[60:23.01]Looney Turns.
[60:24.47]Amphibious.
[60:25.97]Dragon.
[60:27.21]That one fits with our theme.
[60:29.43]Now let's find out how to fucking make one.
[60:30.79]I know it's like this is the start.
[60:32.51]So let's do this.
[60:37.69]Yeah, there we go.
[60:39.77]It's gonna be a long line for this one.
[60:41.17]Alright, making a roller coaster.
[60:51.24]Use the in-world buttons to manipulate the track with precision control.
[60:54.51]Left click away from the coaster to place the next track piece.
[60:58.07]Okay.
[61:01.33]So that means I can, this is like left and right.
[61:06.00]Okay.
[61:08.00]This is up and down and this is forward and back.
[61:11.34]Alright.
[61:12.76]I need a chain.
[61:16.28]Delete.
[61:16.88]Select track piece.
[61:17.78]Unplaced piece.
[61:18.68]Cancel.
[61:19.08]Let's take a look at advanced.
[61:20.90]Alright.
[61:23.08]Station.
[61:23.78]How does it work here?
[61:24.76]Standard track.
[61:25.44]Friction wheel lift.
[61:26.70]Okay.
[61:26.86]It's already on that one.
[61:30.61]Up, up, up.
[61:31.75]Let's go.
[61:32.13]What?
[61:41.14]No.
[61:41.24]Alright.
[61:45.24]Female Jesus, thanks for 2,500.
[61:46.26]Since this is a snail theme park, all your rides have to go one mile per hour.
[61:52.00]Well, that's potentially going to happen.
[61:53.56]What does this one mean?
[61:55.30]Oh, you can rotate it.
[61:58.38]Alright, this needs to be going up.
[61:59.76]Angle snap.
[62:01.60]Auto tunnel height markers.
[62:05.40]C level.
[62:06.72]Turn that off.
[62:09.01]Auto complete.
[62:09.73]Okay, build is enter.
[62:10.77]Okay.
[62:12.33]Perfect.
[62:14.41]This doesn't have the chain on it.
[62:16.19]This does not have the chain on it.
[62:18.37]Friction wheels up.
[62:20.57]Wait, no, no, no.
[62:24.18]I had it right.
[62:30.75]That's what I want.
[62:31.25]There it is.
[62:31.99]Okay.
[62:32.47]Perfect.
[62:40.90]My framerate's kind of dying here.
[62:47.30]Is this too high?
[62:50.23]This is as big as a casino.
[62:52.47]What does that even mean?
[62:58.27]How fucking high can this go?
[63:03.83]Okay, that's as high as it can go apparently.
[63:05.49]Okay.
[63:06.99]Okay, push the train along slowly.
[63:25.04]Yeah.
[63:27.70]This way.
[63:28.18]There we go.
[63:30.87]Now we need a forward piece of train.
[63:39.51]And that's going to go down now.
[63:42.11]Like that.
[63:45.25]Nothing's too high.
[63:48.33]Block section, trim brake, friction brakes, drive tires.
[63:53.98]Standard track, non-inverted station.
[63:57.12]Okay.
[63:58.54]Let's go for it.
[64:00.88]How do I make like a huge angled drop?
[64:07.20]No, not helix up.
[64:14.80]Holy shit, this is fucking too much.
[64:17.20]They're gonna hit their face.
[64:24.80]There we go.
[64:25.36]Helix down.
[64:28.62]Like that.
[64:32.48]Helix down.
[64:33.34]Alright, how do I just duplicate this?
[64:39.86]I want this to happen over and over again.
[64:41.61]This has got to be a way for me to keep that going, right?
[64:57.15]What does this mean?
[64:59.07]Alright, what is the actual selection here?
[65:04.38]To make this just keep going the way I want it.
[65:06.04]Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V?
[65:06.96]I don't think that works.
[65:12.26]Enter.
[65:12.60]Yeah, but I want to keep that track selected.
[65:15.77]Like that.
[65:18.41]Alt-F4.
[65:20.25]That's not right.
[65:26.98]Copy and paste.
[65:28.02]Where's copy and paste here?
[65:30.60]Attach and rotate.
[65:31.52]Attach.
[65:33.72]Free.
[65:37.23]You really just tried?
[65:38.03]Control C, Control V. I'm not sure.
[65:40.93]I don't know how this all works.
[65:46.07]Tools tab.
[65:51.26]Because I want to just like... Maybe I just have to keep clicking it.
[65:56.76]What the fuck?
[66:01.32]Why are you doing this to me?
[66:05.22]Whatever, I'll do it the slow, old-fashioned way.
[66:07.64]I thought there was a quicker way to do it.
[66:08.82]There probably is.
[66:09.32]Do you think people can ride this?
[66:24.48]This is just... You really get flushed down a toilet.
[66:28.36]Hold on a minute.
[66:31.64]Is this thing actually going to work?
[66:35.01]Where's the... Alright, test it.
[66:41.49]Oh boy, my frame rate.
[66:49.34]Let's get it up there.
[66:57.91]It's a snail park.
[66:59.37]It has the most intense roller coaster in the fucking whole world.
[67:05.49]Oh, my frames.
[67:06.35]60 FPS, right?
[67:08.44]That's what I said.
[67:11.36]Holy shit, this is taking forever.
[67:13.44]Even on max speed.
[67:15.20]Disable shadows?
[67:16.12]I probably am gonna do that.
[67:17.34]That's a good idea.
[67:21.59]Too many Gs!
[67:26.02]Alright, here we go.
[67:26.64]Let's see if this even does anything.
[67:29.76]Come on now.
[67:30.90]We're almost there.
[67:31.58]Okay.
[67:37.47]Go for it.
[67:38.27]Have fun.
[67:38.73]Yeah, there we go.
[67:43.47]Isn't it going to be fun?
[67:48.77]It's pretty slow.
[67:49.75]I think it's going to be safe.
[67:50.71]I don't think it's going to get enough speed for it to be a concern.
[67:57.14]It's gonna just slowly go around, right?
[68:01.98]It might pick up some speed, but it gets halfway down.
[68:07.30]Here it goes!
[68:11.50]Yeah!
[68:12.92]It works!
[68:15.95]It works perfectly fine, just as intended!
[68:18.35]It actually works!
[68:27.78]That's gonna be fucking awesome.
[68:30.50]Alright, stop the test.
[68:34.38]Is it still crashing?
[68:36.49]Jesus.
[68:36.85]Alright, then it's gonna go from here.
[68:42.37]It's gonna go up.
[68:49.81]Up just enough for it to... No, we don't regular track.
[69:02.17]It's going to turn a little here.
[69:03.29]No, no, no, no.
[69:04.75]Don't turn.
[69:05.65]People fly off.
[69:10.23]Now we can start to turn it.
[69:13.20]Look at that.
[69:13.54]Look at that bank.
[69:14.44]And just fucking drop them.
[69:27.15]Wait, what?
[69:31.95]Hopefully I can make it up there.
[69:37.03]I want it to be like a very long drop here.
[69:44.05]Should I slam on the brakes?
[69:56.60]I'll turn this way.
[70:02.01]No, they're going to fly off that shit.
[70:04.12]No, just keep going down.
[70:07.52]Make it steeper?
[70:08.18]How do you make it steeper?
[70:10.50]Isn't this as steep as it'll go?
[70:11.68]Or is there a special thing I have to do?
[70:15.22]Run me to the ground?
[70:18.42]I think that's as steep as I can make it, right?
[70:21.96]I don't seem to be able to go any steeper than that.
[70:25.88]This is another thing to click on.
[70:31.79]Alright, let's disable shadows right now.
[70:37.49]Graphics.
[70:39.25]Borderless window.
[70:39.97]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[70:41.09]Vsync.
[70:41.89]No.
[70:42.19]Alright.
[70:46.01]Where is it?
[70:47.03]Depth of field.
[70:47.85]Shadows.
[70:49.87]Lowest or just off?
[70:53.07]Let's turn them off.
[70:56.75]Oh, no.
[70:57.15]That looks awful.
[70:58.91]I can't do that.
[70:59.51]That looks so bad.
[71:04.50]What about, like, low?
[71:07.04]Okay, I'm gonna do low.
[71:07.94]Because I, that, like, it doesn't, I feel like I'm playing a Nintendo 64 game like that.
[71:17.83]Off, off, off.
[71:21.25]Where the fuck is that resolution?
[71:22.39]What do you mean?
[71:22.87]What are you talking about?
[71:25.27]What?
[71:25.41]It's like a fucked up resolution?
[71:33.09]Why is it in 1280x720?
[71:33.63]That doesn't make any sense.
[71:38.24]What?
[71:40.50]Okay.
[71:41.44]Apparently it's in 1280x720.
[71:44.92]Something I did not know until right now.
[71:50.63]This does not look on my screen like... This is 1080.
[71:54.31]At least from what I'm seeing.
[71:58.29]780?
[71:58.43]Are you laughing at me because I have a 780?
[72:05.59]Don't laugh at me because I have a 780.
[72:09.98]Wow, I'm getting made fun of.
[72:16.20]Angle snap, turn that shit off.
[72:23.49]Track supports, just turn those off and on if I want to.
[72:25.95]Alright, let's keep going.
[72:30.16]It scales to your screen.
[72:32.40]Well, no, it was, like, in 1080.
[72:34.40]Like, when I first loaded the game, I thought.
[72:37.06]Because this shit is... Doesn't look like it's... I know when a game is, like, scaled, it doesn't look like it's scaled.
[72:45.97]Alright, let's connect it.
[72:46.67]Let's see if this works.
[72:49.25]Because this goes around, like, the whole park.
[72:51.51]So that this could be, like, you know, while you're up there, you can watch, like, the cool rides being done.
[72:57.59]Buy a 1080.
[72:58.37]The theory is that I will be able to have a new computer.
[73:01.21]6900. i7.
[73:01.27]1080.
[73:01.49]All new motherboard.
[73:03.38]It's gonna be good.
[73:05.28]Don't worry.
[73:08.02]Alright, where the fuck does this thing start?
[73:13.42]Shit.
[73:14.24]Hold on.
[73:14.56]Okay, this is more like a monorail than it is a rollercoaster.
[73:22.91]It's gonna go around the whole park.
[73:31.09]See, now you're just on like a sightseeing trip.
[73:44.19]No, I don't like this.
[73:46.67]I don't like this at all.
[73:51.70]I don't like this.
[73:53.88]Alright.
[73:54.80]It's done.
[73:57.38]There it is.
[73:59.08]Test it.
[74:03.18]Not even a super computer.
[74:05.02]Yeah, it is!
[74:06.48]A 6900K?
[74:07.96]Overclocked?
[74:08.73]That's like, fuckin', that's like a hundred cores!
[74:15.15]Yeah, this is a tour of the park.
[74:18.43]While you're on this, you get to enjoy the sights.
[74:25.28]Alright, fine, I'll turn off fuckin' stupid-ass shadows.
[74:30.66]Depth of field, bloom, turn off the bloom.
[74:35.93]Shadows off.
[74:37.12]Water quality, medium.
[74:40.30]Yeah, we can all make fun of my shitty 780.
[74:44.80]My 780 sucks, I know.
[74:46.00]Now let's get inside of it.
[74:52.02]Where's the camera for me to do that?
[74:53.60]Not free camera.
[74:58.59]I want to... There we go.
[74:59.19]Alright, this is going to be fun.
[75:05.93]See, you get to look down, you'll see all the rides.
[75:12.58]And then, once you go over here... Look at this.
[75:17.06]You can see the huge water, the huge lake.
[75:23.18]And then you realize that you brought your kids to a fucking shitty theme park.
[75:27.58]And you look down at that.
[75:29.16]And you go, why did we get in line for this?
[75:37.18]What oh shit it was still in fast speed it didn't work Hold on wait wait wait wait Get me out of this camera.
[75:52.52]What's going on here?
[75:53.76]What's the problem?
[75:59.54]Is there an issue here?
[76:04.82]Alright, the issue is this is too steep.
[76:07.28]I knew it.
[76:08.92]Okay.
[76:12.22]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[76:13.27]I'll fix it.
[76:14.13]I'll fix it.
[76:14.73]Just give me a second.
[76:19.23]Alright, stop it.
[76:21.79]Stop the test.
[76:26.73]Track exceeds limit.
[76:29.75]What the fuck are you talking about?
[76:37.58]I need to, like, get rid of this.
[76:42.06]Can I just drop it a little bit?
[76:45.15]Yeah, I can.
[76:45.51]Like that.
[76:50.77]Drop this.
[76:51.31]And then I get a drop of this.
[76:56.97]Speed limit.
[77:04.06]Alright.
[77:04.90]Getting there.
[77:08.89]Getting there.
[77:10.61]This thing is ugly, too.
[77:11.75]Can I drop the whole thing?
[77:20.66]I can't.
[77:20.98]It goes one frame per second, but I can do it.
[77:30.96]This whole thing needs to be brought forward.
[77:37.63]This coaster's meant for kids.
[77:42.23]What am I doing?
[77:42.81]I'm trying to make it so I can, like... Hold on, let's move this up.
[77:50.26]And let's get this piece.
[77:54.26]Goddamn, goddamn 780.
[78:01.22]Is that, like, steady enough now for it to do it?
[78:04.00]We can just do this.
[78:04.70]Get this out of here.
[78:09.51]No, no, no, no.
[78:10.47]Don't delete the whole coaster, please.
[78:14.45]Huh?
[78:15.17]Wait, it's done?
[78:15.69]It's not done?
[78:16.15]I didn't want it to be done.
[78:19.01]Yeah, fuck off.
[78:21.52]I have to just get rid of this section.
[78:22.92]This is too big.
[78:29.80]Just fucking delete it.
[78:36.38]delete delete delete delete delete alright now I just have to get it there this is so hard to look at child coaster okay I swear to god I played the other frontier roller coaster game
[79:03.74]And I made the same coaster.
[79:04.84]The same exact thing.
[79:06.90]Somebody look it up.
[79:07.76]I bet you it's the same exact one.
[79:15.68]Alright, yeah.
[79:16.00]We're going to get rid of this whole thing.
[79:17.32]I got it.
[79:17.70]It's all set now.
[79:19.18]I just have to get a hold of this one.
[79:21.98]And delete.
[79:26.54]That is better.
[79:31.67]You want me to autocomplete it from here?
[79:33.11]What the hell is that gonna do?
[79:35.48]Look at all that money I'm making.
[79:43.46]Okay.
[79:44.70]What happens if I do autocomplete it from here?
[79:46.00]I'm curious.
[79:48.26]Okay, autocomplete.
[79:52.67]Oh, God.
[79:53.45]What the fuck?
[79:58.77]Okay, whoa, look at that.
[80:01.33]That was cool!
[80:02.07]Do it!
[80:04.25]Yeah!
[80:04.85]Hell yeah!
[80:06.75]Done!
[80:07.01]Uh-oh, the game's crashing.
[80:12.17]No, it's good.
[80:15.13]A little snake came out and, like, wormed its way down and finished the coaster.
[80:18.41]Alright, there's the first- Oh, fuck, no.
[80:21.25]That's horrible.
[80:23.83]We have to, like, move everything to the right.
[80:33.27]Okay, well, that looks good.
[80:36.81]If it was like over there.
[80:39.00]Can I move the whole thing?
[80:40.00]Because I want to move the entire thing over here.
[80:46.14]Uh, let's see.
[80:53.31]Alright, how do I select the entire thing?
[80:57.97]What the fuck did you just do?
[81:01.01]Serpent coaster?
[81:06.90]Select track.
[81:08.52]I wonder if... I've seen streamers with 1080 lag in this game.
[81:17.78]I'm sorry.
[81:18.50]I have a shitty graphics card.
[81:23.97]We'll come back to that.
[81:24.81]We're going to move that over.
[81:26.29]It's ready.
[81:29.97]It's done.
[81:30.17]Hold on.
[81:30.37]I can move it.
[81:35.91]Right?
[81:36.31]The whole thing's selected right now.
[81:39.15]No, I can't.
[81:41.23]There we go!
[81:43.03]Yes!
[81:45.77]Fuck, I'm lagging.
[81:48.71]Oh, God.
[81:52.25]Come on!
[81:54.97]I can't move.
[81:55.71]I can't move.
[81:59.46]Oh, boy.
[81:59.94]Almost there.
[82:07.66]Almost there come on Like if you just sucks Got it click click Yes Everybody cheer for me.
[82:31.13]Oh My god, I fucking can't do anything See this is why I need a 6900
[82:37.66]69 would resolve this.
[82:41.44]Place the entrance.
[82:44.37]Oh, god damn it.
[82:49.71]God damn it.
[82:50.73]Okay.
[82:53.01]Can't go on the other side, can it?
[82:55.70]Well, that's okay.
[82:58.98]That's okay.
[83:03.05]just backwards.
[83:03.83]Don't worry about it.
[83:05.73]69 XD.
[83:09.59]Alright, let's get a path.
[83:13.91]I need like a Q path.
[83:20.14]Lovely blue path.
[83:24.70]You can switch its side in edit mode.
[83:27.52]Okay, well that's definitely what I'm going to do.
[83:30.90]Yeah, but it's going to spin the whole thing around, isn't it?
[83:35.97]That turn in the end is going to kill people?
[83:38.13]Well, you take risks when you ride on my coasters.
[83:42.93]So I can flip it.
[83:45.89]God, this is going to be a bad idea.
[83:47.41]Because I'm going to have to move it again, aren't I?
[83:57.27]Okay, now move.
[83:59.17]Here we go.
[84:07.62]Ah!
[84:09.02]I can't do it.
[84:09.94]I can't do it.
[84:13.78]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[84:16.76]Come on, you can do it!
[84:18.02]You can do it!
[84:21.36]Oh, fuck.
[84:21.82]Okay, it's gonna be on this side.
[84:23.29]That'll work.
[84:27.45]Ah!
[84:29.83]Come on, coaster!
[84:31.73]This way, this way, this way.
[84:36.29]This is horrible.
[84:39.07]There we go.
[84:39.37]Alright, don't fucking move.
[84:42.38]Get it there nice and easily.
[84:46.72]Please.
[84:47.66]There we go.
[84:49.24]Done.
[84:51.38]Click.
[84:53.02]You can do it.
[84:53.44]I know you can.
[84:54.06]Come on.
[84:56.25]That's like when you have a big shit in your stomach.
[85:01.71]And you just don't want to come out.
[85:02.77]It kind of hurts when you're pushing it out.
[85:05.87]And then when it's finally like... God, it's out of here!
[85:07.71]It's like...
[85:09.74]No, apparently there's another... I'm apparently blocked up with another shit, apparently.
[85:12.69]Because I can't move.
[85:15.83]That was disgusting.
[85:16.81]I'm sorry.
[85:17.29]Okay, what the fuck?
[85:19.63]Alright.
[85:20.91]Back to your regularly scheduled PG stream.
[85:27.59]Test it.
[85:27.93]Let's see if it'll even work.
[85:37.72]In your stomach.
[85:38.38]Well, you know what I'm talking about.
[85:39.34]Just, like, in you.
[85:43.86]At least you're sorry.
[85:44.74]Yeah, I did apologize for it immediately.
[85:46.42]I figured it was wrong.
[85:47.44]Alright, let's get inside of this.
[85:55.20]Let's get in the seat portion.
[86:00.91]It looks cool.
[86:03.03]It looks kind of cool.
[86:12.46]Alright, let's see.
[86:12.98]Let's see if I can throw up.
[86:14.04]First person ride on the Wonder Zone's first coaster.
[86:16.90]A, uh... I don't know what I'm gonna call it.
[86:23.68]Something crazy.
[86:25.62]Alright, a puke warning immediately.
[86:31.51]Here we go!
[86:32.09]Oh fuck, it's in fast motion!
[86:41.24]Oh, yeah.
[86:41.70]I can feel the wind in my hair.
[86:48.53]It's over.
[86:50.97]Let's do it again.
[86:54.21]I got like three achievements for that.
[86:57.15]Yeah, go again.
[86:58.07]Go again.
[87:04.01]I'm surprised it works.
[87:05.09]It works.
[87:09.48]Ears, ears.
[87:14.74]On a dime.
[87:16.20]It just stops.
[87:20.06]This would probably kill you even if you weren't flying off.
[87:24.43]This time I'll do normal speed.
[87:28.35]Yeah, this one's called the slinky.
[87:35.93]You'll ride this and your head will hurt.
[87:38.97]This is going to move your brain around and your skull.
[87:43.87]You know what I'm saying?
[87:44.41]This is what's going to happen, right?
[87:46.27]Alright, normal speed.
[87:47.47]No, we'll do normal speed right now.
[87:50.39]I'd say like right about down here is where your brain has turned into gravy.
[87:58.84]Your brain is just moving around in your head.
[88:01.52]You're just getting like 20 concussions in a row.
[88:07.28]Alright, let's take a look.
[88:08.30]Let's look at the cinematic camera.
[88:11.00]Let's see what this one does.
[88:13.49]Oh, yeah!
[88:15.27]There it goes.
[88:16.03]So, you're still fine here.
[88:26.01]That's not even that bad!
[88:27.38]It's only when you get down to, like, here.
[88:28.80]Look at this bank!
[88:37.32]Oh, this is great!
[88:41.54]And then this is a huge drop.
[88:43.64]And then it breaks.
[88:44.92]Everybody's hands in the air.
[88:50.66]The thing turns and... It's ready.
[88:58.27]It's ready.
[89:01.49]Alright, perfect.
[89:02.65]Let's take a look at the... What are the stats?
[89:07.03]Maintenance, it's alright.
[89:08.50]Statistics, it's pretty low.
[89:11.67]Cars per train, number of trains, minimum ride loader, wait and mate 60 seconds.
[89:17.49]Okay.
[89:19.85]Alright.
[89:20.47]It's ready.
[89:23.33]Checklist is incomplete.
[89:26.11]I need an entrance, right?
[89:30.19]Okay.
[89:31.40]I need my entrance.
[89:34.88]Your neck will not survive.
[89:36.06]No, you...
[89:38.38]No one's gonna ride this shit.
[89:40.00]Alright.
[89:40.62]Paths.
[89:41.17]Let's go with Q. Let's do it.
[89:45.25]I'm not gonna make this come all the way over here.
[89:46.55]I am gonna give this, like, a pretty decent line, though.
[89:50.86]Because people are gonna be lined up.
[89:52.60]People are gonna come from, like, all over the world to ride this fucking ride.
[90:21.20]I fucked it up.
[90:28.22]Okay, right there.
[90:30.18]Right there.
[90:44.16]Get a picture.
[90:45.30]Get a picture.
[90:47.42]Snapshot.
[90:50.35]Right there.
[90:51.01]Okay.
[90:54.23]Now I need a path to connect to this.
[90:58.73]What color is this one?
[91:00.95]That path.
[91:03.83]There we go.
[91:06.17]Move it straight this way.
[91:07.55]Make it a little longer.
[91:14.15]That's good.
[91:18.67]Which will allow us
[91:21.11]to go here.
[91:23.23]Straight across.
[91:29.34]And it's that easy.
[91:33.22]That's wicked ugly, but I don't really give a shit.
[91:37.10]You didn't come here to think that everything looked cool.
[91:39.48]You came here to think how fucking awesome the park is.
[91:43.35]Doesn't even matter.
[91:43.91]Who cares?
[91:44.35]Alright.
[91:49.30]And it's open for business.
[91:53.81]Dragon 1.
[91:55.01]No, we're going to name it something else.
[91:57.59]Slinky.
[92:03.19]Slinky.
[92:05.40]Okay, we're almost ready to open the park.
[92:07.38]I need a couple more rides.
[92:08.62]Okay.
[92:18.82]Uh, track rides.
[92:19.75]Boom boat.
[92:20.49]Powered ride.
[92:21.15]Water.
[92:21.41]Oh, we gotta have a water ride.
[92:22.45]A log flume.
[92:24.27]Are you serious?
[92:25.89]I don't know.
[92:26.35]I'll use the default one.
[92:28.95]The log flume is gonna be over here.
[92:35.03]No, no log flume.
[92:36.07]It's too much.
[92:40.78]With a kitty cat on it?
[92:44.88]no no no no rides let's just get some default rides in here like the dumb magic twirl just a couple so people don't get mad play some exit this is just to make people not angry that this place sucks
[93:18.78]Because you could come to this theme park and go into the clown bathroom.
[93:21.88]Get a couple of cheeseburgers and milkshake.
[93:24.04]And then ride that.
[93:25.73]That's the only reason to come here.
[93:26.85]But if you hate the park, the park's terrible, right?
[93:31.05]Then at least you'll be able to ride this shitty Dark Souls graveyard.
[93:35.91]You know what I mean?
[93:36.70]This is like a Dark Souls graveyard.
[93:38.24]And you come in and there's an Estus Shard right there.
[93:42.46]And then hiding behind here, this is where the big guy is in Bloodborne.
[93:45.36]He comes out and attacks you.
[93:48.82]People would ride that.
[93:49.80]They'd like that game.
[93:52.74]Open.
[93:53.80]Don't need to test it.
[93:55.75]Let's get another couple rides in here.
[94:00.21]Insanity.
[94:00.81]I'm sure it's popular.
[94:06.57]The rides are free.
[94:08.87]Guys, the rides are free.
[94:09.78]It's like 50 bucks to get in the park.
[94:11.88]The rides are free and the shit is wicked expensive.
[94:17.66]Just give me one more ride and I'll open the park.
[94:24.60]So now I need, like, people to... I need guests.
[94:30.93]Open it up.
[94:37.33]Okay, now nobody can complain.
[94:38.70]Estus and Bloodborne baited.
[94:45.15]You know what I mean.
[94:46.06]You guys understand.
[94:47.70]Alright, let's open it.
[94:49.66]Welcome to Wonder Zone.
[94:50.64]I hope you enjoy your stay.
[94:53.26]Except there's so many people trying to get in here.
[94:56.80]Alright, it's open.
[94:57.44]How do I open it?
[94:59.84]How do I open the park?
[95:06.27]Nobody is... Wait, wait, hold on.
[95:11.07]Every single person... I thought the park was closed while I was making it.
[95:17.65]What, you didn't see the archers?
[95:20.38]Oh shit, I'm at -2 dollars this month What the fuck?
[95:33.20]Oh, great Staff, I gotta get a couple of janitors first There's no, okay, there's no trash bags, it's okay Forty-five dollars to get in?
[95:43.97]Yeah!
[95:44.55]Cause the rides are free
[95:47.84]God damn it.
[95:48.78]I made the ride the price of the game I'll find it at ten dollars And it's eight dollars if you come with a group oh Yeah, now I'll come in that's a steal I'm kind of excited No, fuck that means these these things have to cost money
[96:13.60]It's $4.50?
[96:14.08]That's okay.
[96:14.66]$4.50 is good.
[96:16.92]$7?
[96:16.98]Perfect.
[96:17.82]How much is this one?
[96:21.10]$6?
[96:21.12]Whoa!
[96:23.84]Sorry, dude.
[96:25.10]This is gonna have to be like $10.
[96:26.68]Alright, hold on.
[96:31.49]Give me a little bit of slack.
[96:33.25]In previous RollerCoaster Tycoon games, didn't you, in sandbox mode, have to manually open the park?
[96:41.60]I thought it was just closed until you actually opened it.
[96:45.77]That's what I thought was going on.
[96:48.77]Look it.
[96:49.31]Now the place is flooding with people.
[96:53.76]I got all the money in the world.
[96:55.14]Who cares?
[96:56.28]I got seven comments on a YouTube video.
[96:59.78]Let's see.
[97:00.06]What?
[97:04.13]What?
[97:09.09]What?
[97:10.75]Is it even possible?
[97:12.33]They were just working.
[97:14.79]Oh, fuck.
[97:15.79]Reopen them!
[97:16.91]I need more people.
[97:19.31]Oh, you fucking assholes.
[97:20.65]I didn't know they were actually... Alright, we'll come back to work.
[97:26.21]Hire new people.
[97:28.49]That's my mistake.
[97:32.67]No, the janitor didn't quit at least.
[97:38.02]Yeah, I was paying people to come to the park and stand in a window.
[97:45.09]Why am I working here?
[97:46.21]This is fucking horrible.
[97:48.31]I just stand here.
[97:49.39]I don't even talk to anybody.
[97:52.61]What's everybody's problem?
[97:57.66]Park entry was expensive and now Magic Squirrel 1 costs a lot?
[98:03.68]What the fuck?
[98:04.44]It was $10 to come in here.
[98:07.71]It was ten fucking dollars to come in.
[98:11.29]You guys have got to be kidding me.
[98:13.17]You know how cheap that is?
[98:15.45]You think it's expensive to come in here.
[98:18.62]For ten dollars.
[98:21.10]Is six dollars asking too much to go into an amusement park?
[98:29.92]Okay, finally I have people getting in line.
[98:32.69]This is still too much money.
[98:36.21]Would you be happy if it was a dollar?
[98:37.56]$1.50.
[98:37.98]Oh yeah, now I like that.
[98:42.30]I want to enjoy an entire day at a theme park for $8.00.
[98:44.96]That's bullshit.
[98:50.55]Talking about losing money.
[98:52.11]I have to make this thing like $2.00.
[98:54.71]Let's make it like $2.60 or something.
[99:01.19]I don't know.
[99:01.53]$2.75. $2.75.
[99:08.56]That's really dumb.
[99:10.80]Why is nobody coming to this other side of the park?
[99:15.16]Terra learns capitalism.
[99:19.52]Your park sucks.
[99:22.02]Well, this is like the first time I've ever played.
[99:24.66]I'm just getting the swing of things.
[99:26.80]It'll get better, don't worry.
[99:27.74]I need... Okay, hold on.
[99:33.12]Let's just get something straight here.
[99:35.31]I need...
[99:38.83]Barrels.
[99:42.48]Barrels for these people to throw their dirty trash.
[99:44.50]So they don't put it in my rides.
[99:49.98]I need benches too.
[99:52.68]Here.
[99:55.61]Thank you.
[99:56.09]Thank you for using the barrel.
[99:58.45]For a second I thought she just threw it on the ground.
[99:59.89]There.
[100:03.01]You get your sandwich and then you can come sit over here.
[100:13.08]Cool music.
[100:18.17]Right there.
[100:19.39]No.
[100:19.71]Whatever.
[100:22.61]Put a couple benches over here.
[100:24.49]For the old ladies to sit to watch the grandkids.
[100:28.64]We need one.
[100:29.12]No.
[100:30.52]Not there.
[100:33.04]Do I have bathrooms?
[100:34.78]Is the clown bathroom the only one I have?
[100:41.04]I can't believe standard restroom block 2 is free.
[100:45.33]Yeah, this is a bathroom.
[100:46.01]This is fine.
[100:49.01]Okay, yeah, standard restroom.
[100:50.61]It's, uh... Should it be 10 cents to use the bathroom?
[100:55.39]No.
[100:57.13]Alright, let's get another ride here.
[100:59.96]Should we do another coaster?
[101:00.84]This time let's make, like, an actual cool coaster.
[101:07.70]Mmm... Wooden hybrid steel.
[101:12.35]Let's go with hybrid.
[101:13.75]No, no, no, no, no.
[101:14.89]I want one of those ones that, like, you hang on to.
[101:18.25]The suspended ones.
[101:26.01]Pioneer.
[101:29.59]Test pilot.
[101:34.16]I wonder, do they even have those yet?
[101:37.82]It's kind of the closest thing it looks like.
[101:41.47]Chain lift can invert for adults and teens only.
[101:44.11]Okay.
[101:46.67]This one's not going to be wild.
[101:48.41]I'm going to actually make a fucking coaster.
[101:53.10]So, where's the entrance?
[101:54.60]The entrance is right here.
[101:57.02]This one's going to be a simple but decent coaster.
[102:00.10]I'm going to have no major thrills.
[102:02.70]It's not going to be as long of a line as the Slinky.
[102:10.50]Okay.
[102:11.56]Very easily, we're going to start like this.
[102:13.08]It's going to go up.
[102:17.12]Nice, steep incline.
[102:20.57]This one's going to be for kids.
[102:24.13]Right there.
[102:27.01]Straighten it out.
[102:27.59]Push along the path.
[102:33.26]This one's going to be for kids.
[102:36.90]Hold on.
[102:40.93]Alright, I want to... Where's the speed booster?
[102:52.27]Entry station?
[102:53.23]No.
[102:57.58]No, this one's for kids.
[102:58.70]This one's for kids.
[103:00.28]I ain't gonna fuck this one up.
[103:03.52]It's going to start.
[103:04.28]Okay, it's at no speed yet.
[103:05.49]I'm going to do a little bit of a little kid drop.
[103:09.67]You know, so the little kids will be like, whoa!
[103:11.89]And then it's right here.
[103:12.69]It'll be okay right there.
[103:17.31]We'll go like that.
[103:18.17]This one's for kids.
[103:22.02]And I want it to turn from here.
[103:26.60]Let's go down a little bit.
[103:31.48]Okay.
[103:31.60]Okay.
[103:36.86]Go like that.
[103:37.86]I guess we can just go down a little bit.
[103:41.28]Right there.
[103:44.52]And that should bring us straight up into a, what is it?
[103:50.96]A pretzel.
[103:56.92]No.
[103:57.12]A standard loop.
[103:59.01]Cut back around to the left, I think I want to do.
[104:05.81]Yeah.
[104:07.29]So now it's going to finish over here.
[104:10.44]Let's bank it.
[104:12.90]Let's do that.
[104:16.58]Give it a nice bank.
[104:18.82]If I can.
[104:28.66]Alright.
[104:32.66]Okay.
[104:37.49]And then it drops down again.
[104:38.95]We're gonna bank it back.
[104:41.71]I don't know.
[104:43.27]Like that.
[104:44.47]Straight on.
[104:44.99]Alright.
[104:51.26]That looks good.
[104:53.68]I may as well drag the money for an early... No, this one's for kids!
[104:58.08]I'm gonna even name it for kids.
[104:59.90]So parents know that it's for kids.
[105:06.23]And it just runs the kids right into the ground.
[105:08.35]No, I wanna... This whole thing is fucked up from right here.
[105:16.61]I hate when the sun does that shit.
[105:22.79]Ooh, made $900!
[105:36.31]Yeah.
[105:37.35]And then these kids are upside down.
[105:44.92]Yeah.
[105:45.34]Good luck holding your luncheon, kids.
[105:50.60]Now let's just auto-complete it.
[105:51.86]I just need to get it over there.
[105:56.26]And let's check it out.
[105:58.74]There it is.
[105:59.14]That one's not bad.
[106:01.65]Let's give it a test.
[106:06.72]Let's see how this one works.
[106:07.50]Alright.
[106:11.00]How do I... Let's ride the ride.
[106:12.16]Alright.
[106:14.82]Let's see how this one for kids is.
[106:26.16]Easy Pete's Wild Ride.
[106:29.75]Got like holding in your lunchables.
[106:31.01]Alright.
[106:32.51]Here we go.
[106:36.34]The only thing I'm concerned about is if the kids aren't going to like this part.
[106:43.67]Everything else is fine.
[106:47.03]Here we go.
[106:49.33]So far so good.
[106:50.03]We bring it to the first loop.
[106:53.41]It just barely goes over.
[106:57.75]It's not going to make this one.
[107:01.03]Fuck.
[107:03.73]Alright, okay.
[107:04.94]Hold on.
[107:07.21]Mix it up with the first one.
[107:08.63]That means all we gotta do is drop this.
[107:10.17]Let's edit the track.
[107:18.15]No, no, no, no.
[107:18.49]Get out of there.
[107:23.09]Sorry, kids.
[107:23.80]Alright.
[107:27.78]Just drag this thing down right here.
[107:30.40]What do you mean I can't fucking do that?
[107:40.13]Okay, drag this one down.
[107:41.91]Now the whole thing has to come down from here.
[107:46.23]A little bit further down.
[107:50.77]Now I feel like that's going to be enough.
[107:56.71]If this just comes down, I think we're good.
[107:58.13]What do you think?
[108:04.38]I think so.
[108:05.88]Let's give it a test.
[108:13.94]Test it.
[108:21.24]Almost at the top.
[108:24.53]Alright.
[108:28.53]This is the first person camera.
[108:30.03]Let's see how it looks from first person.
[108:36.39]I made this a little bit steeper.
[108:40.23]And then it'll go around this one faster, because it got hung up here.
[108:44.25]That should make it go around this one faster.
[108:47.15]Which in turn will get them around this one.
[108:50.43]And then they make their way down.
[108:53.70]That was pretty sick.
[108:57.28]I like it.
[108:58.90]Got the bank.
[109:00.98]Upside down.
[109:02.36]Spins you back right way.
[109:03.42]Before they finish.
[109:11.69]They all stop so short.
[109:16.23]I got some hang time there.
[109:17.77]Got some hang time.
[109:18.53]I like that.
[109:20.75]Nice.
[109:24.21]Checklist.
[109:24.77]Alright, testing.
[109:26.35]Excitement, fear, nausea.
[109:29.27]Max speed, max lateral G12.
[109:34.99]Max effort sheet, 14 Gs.
[109:38.11]What is the NASA?
[109:38.93]What's NASA?
[109:41.58]Don't you go with that machine and NASA and like 20 kills you?
[109:47.32]Alright.
[109:48.08]Track scenery rating.
[109:55.43]It's exciting.
[109:58.99]Where's the max G's at?
[110:00.63]I don't understand that.
[110:01.51]Hold on.
[110:03.17]I want to see this in real time.
[110:06.71]Because the max vertical G's.
[110:18.08]Great.
[110:18.40]And I was trying to see like in real time.
[110:19.84]Alright.
[110:22.24]So what?
[110:22.42]It's like right... Not right there.
[110:30.79]It's probably right here.
[110:32.27]Yeah.
[110:33.15]Okay.
[110:33.39]It's when you go over the little bump.
[110:36.97]This little bump right here is instantly going to kill some people.
[110:44.05]It's not the loops.
[110:45.01]It's going down and then coming up and dying.
[110:49.42]Ten bucks?
[110:49.98]No, it can't be ten bucks.
[110:51.07]It's gonna be two dollars.
[110:54.39]Whatever.
[110:54.75]Fuck it.
[110:55.05]Who cares?
[110:56.53]Black Falcon is... What is it called?
[110:57.83]Black Falcon?
[110:59.59]No.
[111:06.84]Alright, this one's kid-approved.
[111:10.41]Alright, that one's going to go... It's the end.
[111:12.83]12G is the very end.
[111:16.18]This one... I actually don't mind this one being here because we can go around it.
[111:21.18]Yeah, I'll keep it right here.
[111:27.40]Yeah, fuck it if they die.
[111:29.98]Not a big deal.
[111:38.09]It'll be fine.
[111:39.23]We'll get over it.
[111:44.87]Open for business.
[111:46.83]Kit approved is now open.
[111:52.93]Okay.
[111:54.79]Right, I wanted to change that off of J. I keep seeing the photo thing.
[112:01.87]Where is it?
[112:02.65]Controls.
[112:06.98]Path edit mode.
[112:09.66]Path up can be up.
[112:11.44]Path down should be rebinded to... Let's see.
[112:16.50]What am I going to read?
[112:18.38]L?
[112:19.78]What?
[112:22.19]It gives you five seconds to do it.
[112:24.77]Let's go with L. That works.
[112:29.79]Don't?
[112:31.79]Anybody going to ride it?
[112:33.87]I see this family here.
[112:35.01]Look it.
[112:35.39]We've got some kids.
[112:36.05]This is kid approved.
[112:36.51]Kid approved.
[112:38.32]They're coming on to enjoy the ride.
[112:40.14]Oh, look what we did.
[112:40.80]It's just kid approved.
[112:46.67]Never mind.
[112:49.57]Never mind.
[112:51.55]Thirsty.
[112:52.91]Cosmic cow looks busy.
[112:54.03]I'll try somewhere else.
[112:57.57]Okay.
[112:57.87]Well, I need more drink stands.
[113:06.18]People are also 30.
[113:06.78]Alright, I need more drink stands.
[113:12.24]I just have a rollercoaster just drive down and kill people.
[113:16.20]The dad looked angry.
[113:17.14]Yeah, he did.
[113:17.64]No, I need shops.
[113:22.65]Shops and stalls.
[113:23.77]Oh, wow.
[113:24.61]Wait a minute.
[113:25.05]We need a pancake guy.
[113:28.05]Mr. Pancake is going to make his debut.
[113:30.97]People are going to be so happy.
[113:34.62]Hey, kids!
[113:36.22]It's me, Mr. Pancake.
[113:39.74]I have cut my honey nut Cheerio syrup.
[113:43.34]Sting.
[113:44.72]In my right hand.
[113:45.79]Yay.
[113:48.93]Oh, look at the group of kids.
[113:51.51]They're swarming him.
[113:53.45]Oh, my God.
[113:53.95]They're fucking gonna kill this guy.
[113:56.57]Yay.
[113:59.22]Wow, everybody loves him.
[114:04.02]He's gonna lead him into the...
[114:06.51]Lead him into the bathroom.
[114:09.93]Alright, good.
[114:10.67]I like that guy.
[114:13.47]Uh, who else?
[114:14.21]Park management.
[114:14.81]I need some more janitors.
[114:18.59]Let's get, like, two janitors.
[114:19.97]That's fine.
[114:20.65]I need somebody to repair shit, right?
[114:23.48]Mechanic.
[114:23.98]There's only, like, five rides.
[114:25.30]Who cares?
[114:25.84]I'll just put him right here.
[114:27.82]He's not happy.
[114:28.66]I just hired you.
[114:31.96]You just got employed, and he's already not happy.
[114:35.69]I don't like this job.
[114:37.53]I just got it.
[114:38.45]How do you know?
[114:43.31]The most popular ride is the Dark Souls ride.
[114:48.04]It's the only ride people care about.
[114:49.34]We need more stuff.
[114:55.12]I need more scenery, too.
[114:56.18]Wait, they want more drinks or something like that, right?
[115:00.66]Village shop.
[115:02.14]Let's put like a dumb shop here.
[115:05.69]Where's the door?
[115:06.17]Right here?
[115:08.45]Okay.
[115:12.39]Let's put this one like over here to give people a little reason to come over here.
[115:14.77]I don't think anyone has rid the roller coaster yet, by the way.
[115:20.61]Alright.
[115:25.11]What?
[115:26.69]Building 24.
[115:32.26]Oh, it's a cosmic cow.
[115:37.35]Why is this a cosmic cow?
[115:42.71]Okay, well.
[115:44.13]At least it exists.
[115:46.23]People were complaining that there weren't enough of these.
[115:47.69]Alright, what do we got?
[115:52.76]Anybody even come over here yet?
[115:56.00]God damn it!
[115:59.18]I can't queue up for magic twirl one?
[116:02.08]Now, what's wrong with this?
[116:04.84]What's wrong with this ride?
[116:07.29]I think I got yuck on my shoes.
[116:09.65]Somebody ride this.
[116:11.17]Is it too expensive?
[116:12.21]Let's see what this person says.
[116:15.28]Oh, look.
[116:15.76]I'm looking at it.
[116:16.50]I can't wait to ride it.
[116:19.16]No.
[116:30.77]I'm losing money on this ride.
[116:32.33]150.
[116:32.51]This group of badasses.
[116:37.67]Look at them.
[116:38.09]These guys are like young adults.
[116:39.71]They're like ready for anything.
[116:42.54]No.
[116:43.26]Everyone's a wuss.
[116:48.28]Everyone's such a wuss, apparently.
[116:52.22]End of the month, somebody lost 800 dollars.
[116:54.01]Okay, that's fine.
[116:55.63]Wow, framerate.
[116:58.01]Come on.
[116:58.77]It's $1.50. $1.50.
[117:01.98]At least give me a reason.
[117:04.50]Slinky is too intense for me.
[117:08.56]Too intense.
[117:11.81]The ride's not gonna kill him.
[117:12.95]I rode this thing and I was fine.
[117:15.29]Watch.
[117:15.53]You want me to prove it?
[117:18.79]This thing is just running all day.
[117:20.13]Let me look at this.
[117:23.33]Let me see.
[117:23.77]What's the real-time testing?
[117:28.17]Real-time testing.
[117:31.39]What's the problem?
[117:36.89]There's a lot of litter.
[117:37.75]Well, use a trash can.
[117:38.96]Alright, speed it up.
[117:44.48]Let's see what the problem here is.
[117:45.52]I mean, start test.
[117:51.29]The thing's just running?
[117:52.13]I don't understand.
[117:55.25]Only 15 Gs, is it?
[117:57.83]Yeah, that's not a big deal at all.
[118:05.96]15 G's is more than enough to crush your head.
[118:08.94]I don't know why that's making me laugh Where does it happen?
[118:14.19]I think I need more milkshake stands It didn't crush my head when I wrote it I
[118:34.45]This fucking frame rate.
[118:36.89]Alright, so what's the... I need to see what the problem... Average guest happiness is declining.
[118:40.62]Well... If you don't like it, then fuck off.
[118:43.32]Alright, here we go.
[118:45.46]Let's see.
[118:45.82]This is 1G. 1.5.
[118:51.58]3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
[118:56.88]Okay, found the problem.
[119:01.85]Found the problem.
[119:02.89]People don't want to go in the thing that spins you to see if you can be a pilot or not.
[119:07.71]The rest of the ride is alright.
[119:08.77]Alright, so stop the test.
[119:16.07]I have to change this.
[119:19.38]That's so fucking boring.
[119:20.68]We're the thrill seekers.
[119:25.30]Seriously, where are the... I'm up for anything.
[119:28.79]I'll do whatever it takes to be thrilled.
[119:32.43]I built a centrifuge.
[119:36.65]People die at 15 G's.
[119:37.97]Well, it happened here.
[119:39.57]So, we're going to have to do this.
[119:45.93]Right here is where people were starting to die.
[119:48.97]So let's not do that.
[119:52.23]Let's zoom in.
[119:53.59]Get 5 FPS.
[119:57.93]Right here.
[120:01.03]So we'll stop it here.
[120:03.37]Right?
[120:03.93]All these wusses that have human skulls.
[120:06.97]Okay.
[120:08.74]Now you're going to be fine.
[120:11.36]Auto-complete it.
[120:14.68]See?
[120:15.06]Now you're fine.
[120:18.23]Now nobody can complain anymore.
[120:19.47]You're not gonna have a stomach ache.
[120:26.37]Let's test it.
[120:26.95]I'm surprised it's for cyborgs.
[120:37.20]I bet they have 780s too.
[120:43.31]Yeah, fucking humans.
[120:45.67]Give me a break, right?
[120:47.21]Seriously.
[120:49.21]Somebody, anybody riding that ride?
[120:53.11]I think there's a person on that ride.
[120:56.29]Did I make a dollar?
[120:57.19]Fuck, I have to fix that one too.
[121:04.75]Okay, live data.
[121:05.67]Let's watch it.
[121:07.49]Can't go past 10 G's.
[121:10.33]Okay.
[121:15.43]I just want to make the best roller coaster dangerous thrill seeker in the world.
[121:21.39]Is that so much to ask?
[121:24.73]A cyborg wouldn't have a 780.
[121:27.81]Yes, they would.
[121:29.68]Don't you know how long it takes for people to update their computers in a company?
[121:32.96]There are people still using Windows Vista right now.
[121:35.90]Or like Windows XP in a company setting because they didn't buy the next enterprise license because it's too much money.
[121:40.90]You think it's like the cyborgs that were made on the 780s aren't still going to be made on 780s?
[121:47.55]They're still on the 780.
[121:48.13]They're probably still on, like, the 580.
[121:50.06]These are company computers we're talking here.
[121:54.24]So, in a lot of fashion, I'm ahead of the curve.
[121:58.72]780 is much higher than a lot of Enterprise, so... I think I'm doing fine.
[122:05.62]Okay.
[122:07.24]Any minute now.
[122:07.90]See, you look nice and safe for all you danger haters.
[122:13.34]And here we go.
[122:17.20]This ride is fucking lame.
[122:22.60]Did this turn from a cool ride to a lame one?
[122:24.79]Alright, let's see.
[122:25.35]Look at the G's.
[122:27.01]Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[122:32.39]Alright, we're good.
[122:34.44]We're alright.
[122:36.08]Fuck!
[122:43.11]I made it worse.
[122:47.59]This is going 110.
[122:51.20]I can't even fucking assume it.
[123:04.55]65!
[123:04.69]Jeez!
[123:05.25]That person... That person... If you're going... Okay, hold on.
[123:11.53]If you're going 120 miles per hour, 130 miles per hour... Dude, I can't imagine the fastest roller coaster I've ever been on in my life.
[123:27.78]And my whole life, I think went like 60.
[123:31.62]And that was terrifying.
[123:33.95]Can you imagine going 130 miles per hour?
[123:36.97]The seatbelt wouldn't be able to hold you in.
[123:40.19]Alright.
[123:41.47]It happens right here.
[123:42.55]Fuck.
[123:43.51]It's just too high.
[123:44.77]It's too high.
[123:45.71]It's going too fast.
[123:47.77]I have to shrink this roller coaster by like 80%.
[123:49.71]Ugh.
[123:49.94]Fuck.
[123:57.60]Okay.
[123:58.64]Nice and easy.
[124:00.28]The problem is here.
[124:02.98]We need to make it fucking safe for all these fucking losers.
[124:07.01]Alright, so right here is where people turn into silly, buddy.
[124:15.03]Gonna have to change it again.
[124:17.75]Let's go here.
[124:18.41]Delete it.
[124:19.15]I'm okay with it going 130 miles per hour.
[124:23.27]That's fine.
[124:29.14]As in, I'm an EMT.
[124:30.86]At 65 G's, your head would be inside your ass.
[124:36.46]Well, no wonder they don't want to ride it.
[124:38.65]What a bunch of wusses.
[124:42.67]Okay.
[124:43.67]This has got to be straight for a little while.
[124:47.19]Because that's too intense for people.
[124:50.62]Straight.
[124:51.48]Just give them a minute.
[124:52.98]Give them a second or two.
[124:59.61]Alright.
[125:00.23]Is that enough space for them to not turn into goo?
[125:04.37]I don't know.
[125:05.99]We're going to have to find out.
[125:07.81]This is such a fucking lame ride.
[125:10.59]It went from an interesting ride to a really lame... No, no, no.
[125:12.83]It's banking now.
[125:13.69]Don't want to do that.
[125:15.97]A bank would be a terrible thing to do right now.
[125:19.46]Turn it back.
[125:22.18]No, we got to do that all the way back here.
[125:25.28]Very slowly, so nobody dies.
[125:28.76]Bank it again, slowly.
[125:31.06]Right there.
[125:36.75]Okay.
[125:38.77]Straighten it out.
[125:42.03]Okay, now I'm in the hole $1,600.
[125:43.93]That's because nobody will ride these rides.
[125:51.82]This is going to fuck people up, isn't it?
[125:54.73]Let's move it.
[125:58.52]Let's make it a little bit longer, right?
[126:05.28]Okay.
[126:07.82]I feel like that's going to be enough.
[126:10.96]Now this just has to connect.
[126:14.13]So let's drop this whole thing.
[126:18.45]Let's auto-complete it and see what happens.
[126:20.19]Much better.
[126:22.33]Much better.
[126:26.62]Let's try it again.
[126:29.78]No scenery.
[126:30.46]Oh, who cares?
[126:31.68]Cry me a fucking river.
[126:36.03]Test.
[126:36.89]Let's get in the camera ride.
[126:38.33]Alright, seat.
[126:42.95]Oh, no.
[126:43.19]Hold on a second.
[126:46.93]There we go.
[126:51.64]How do I... Wasn't I riding it before?
[126:54.42]And I could see the results on the screen?
[126:58.65]Why can I not see the results now?
[127:04.77]Yeah, like, ride camera.
[127:06.17]But I can't see the results?
[127:10.89]How did I do that last time?
[127:16.64]Okay, apparently I can't do that this time for some dumb reason.
[127:20.86]Where is it?
[127:25.02]Is everybody old enough to ride?
[127:26.20]This is the ride that's not even for kids.
[127:28.98]Stop this ride.
[127:30.50]Stop it.
[127:30.90]Close this ride too.
[127:32.00]Fuck all you people that don't want to ride this.
[127:35.70]Good.
[127:35.90]I'm glad the highest attraction in the whole park is the clown bathroom.
[127:40.68]People pay money to come to the clown bathroom.
[127:42.53]Look at this guy.
[127:44.85]This guy deserves a raise.
[127:47.09]Yep.
[127:48.19]How do I give him more money?
[127:51.41]$200 per month?
[127:53.91]$204 now.
[127:54.99]You got yourself a raise.
[127:58.89]What was I doing?
[127:59.43]Oh, yeah, this.
[127:59.83]Alright, it's not even halfway there.
[128:09.19]Come on, get up there.
[128:11.95]Chief Beef 1.
[128:18.79]Oh, there's too many queue times.
[128:20.25]There's too many queue times.
[128:21.75]The coolest ride in the whole park is over here, but I want to ride the stupid Whirly Durly.
[128:28.05]Mom, why do I have to wait in line for that?
[128:33.23]Look at that cool ride over there.
[128:34.72]You turn into a little slinky.
[128:36.06]No, I want to ride the thing that spins in a circle for a minute.
[128:41.26]Ha ha ha.
[128:41.76]Alright, let's get a better view.
[128:47.78]Is this still going to happen?
[128:49.14]Why can I not see this still?
[128:52.30]13 cents a day raise?
[128:53.18]Yeah.
[128:55.92]Pin the window.
[128:58.65]How the hell do I pin this window?
[128:59.75]Alright, hold on, let's just... Five... Four, okay, five, six, good.
[129:07.04]Yeah, that was... I think I got to ten.
[129:18.46]Ten might be okay.
[129:21.23]That's just before death.
[129:22.67]That's almost dying.
[129:23.71]This needs to change.
[129:24.53]That's why they won't ride it.
[129:28.09]I'm going to put the brakes on right here.
[129:29.31]Are you serious?
[129:32.27]Yeah, see?
[129:32.87]Alright.
[129:34.39]That's the problem.
[129:37.77]15.
[129:37.89]I think that'll be alright.
[129:38.78]As long as... Hold on.
[129:41.02]Close it down.
[129:42.28]Put the brakes on right here.
[129:50.14]Over 10. 10.
[129:53.14]Alright, brakes.
[129:54.20]Let's delete this.
[129:54.90]We got to put some brakes here.
[129:58.30]Used to trim speed of the mid... What?
[130:02.04]No, I need brakes.
[130:05.96]Trim brakes.
[130:08.75]Slows can only be placed on a straight and unbanked track.
[130:11.23]Okay, well, let's make it straight on banked track.
[130:17.55]This looks pretty straight.
[130:21.47]Or is that straight?
[130:24.02]There we go.
[130:24.92]Alright, friction breaks.
[130:25.96]Let's slow this down.
[130:29.63]Slow it down.
[130:31.89]So people don't have to be so concerned about it.
[130:40.71]Alright, there are the breaks.
[130:43.24]Is that going to be enough?
[130:44.34]No, definitely not.
[130:45.76]I need them like back here too.
[130:50.16]What a pain in the ass.
[130:57.23]I think this will be enough.
[130:58.15]Move out of the way, please.
[131:06.90]What?
[131:07.68]Fuck you.
[131:08.04]What are you talking about?
[131:12.44]No, I don't want this to happen.
[131:18.08]I don't want to do that.
[131:19.05]That's the number one thing I don't want to have happen.
[131:26.84]Back this up.
[131:30.05]Now, auto-complete it from here.
[131:33.15]Perfect.
[131:34.15]Done.
[131:35.09]Hopefully, that's enough breaks.
[131:38.17]Let's find out.
[131:39.63]No, over here.
[131:40.49]Over here, there needs to be... That's going to stop and then start again.
[131:51.40]Got it.
[131:51.84]I can't believe I have to do this shit.
[131:55.29]People just need to learn to be cooler, you know what I mean?
[132:02.29]Why can't people just be, like, cool and not care about this?
[132:08.64]Alright, that should do it.
[132:11.30]Park is now going to be reopened.
[132:12.62]Let's see if anybody goes in after I've made it so nobody can die.
[132:15.46]I think people still might be able to die, but not every time.
[132:23.92]Let's test it again.
[132:33.66]Ride camera... Why can I not... How do I... I can't, like, pin this window?
[132:39.76]Because I want to ride the camera and see the result.
[132:41.36]I don't know why it keeps disappearing.
[132:51.46]Don't ask me why it disappears.
[132:52.56]Because you can't be cool when you're dead.
[133:12.57]People will still die, they just won't die as hard.
[133:18.90]Try the slinky, you won't die.
[133:20.38]There we go.
[133:27.52]Okay.
[133:31.36]Thank you for the help.
[133:32.54]I didn't know, like, where that was.
[133:34.14]Edit mode.
[133:34.68]Alright, let's go.
[133:35.24]But... Faster!
[133:39.04]Faster!
[133:43.09]Yeah, this is like... So, is it... Will... If you get on a ride, will no one ride rides in this game over 10 Gs?
[133:55.00]Or will they roll the dice?
[133:57.12]A sign of waiver.
[133:58.68]You get a sign of waiver to go on the ride.
[134:06.38]I need something right here.
[134:07.58]You know what I need?
[134:10.15]I need one of those cameras.
[134:11.05]Can't you put it on like those like...
[134:16.36]Game crash?
[134:23.63]I have enough time to read subs being on this thing.
[134:26.31]I should do that, shouldn't I?
[134:31.08]Alright.
[134:32.68]Hopefully this is better.
[134:35.52]It's gonna be loud.
[134:36.26]It has to have good ratings.
[134:43.94]What would you rate this?
[134:44.98]I would rate this, like, at least a 5 out of 10.
[134:47.25]5 G's?
[134:50.65]Okay.
[134:50.77]Yeah, it's right there.
[134:53.01]It goes to 9.
[134:58.81]That's a fucking ride, but it's fixed.
[135:03.04]This is so loud.
[135:04.60]I'm so sorry.
[135:07.80]Brakes.
[135:09.34]Oh, come on.
[135:10.72]Come on.
[135:13.34]Fucking come on.
[135:21.63]Fine.
[135:22.89]You know what?
[135:28.09]You want to be like that game?
[135:31.64]Fine.
[135:34.98]We can do that.
[135:36.22]We can work that out.
[135:38.66]You don't want me to make the cool rollercoaster?
[135:40.24]Fine, I'll make the safe one.
[135:42.65]You can tell me what you want me to do, game.
[135:46.88]I'm all ears.
[135:54.26]You wanna play that game?
[135:56.22]We'll play that game.
[136:09.11]Bride sucks.
[136:12.40]You wanna play that game, game?
[136:14.04]I can play that game.
[136:16.18]Autocomplete.
[136:21.25]You're making it worse than it was before.
[136:25.69]No, it's just an up and down.
[136:30.75]Where is it going?
[136:35.56]Come on, come on!
[136:38.28]Alright, here it is.
[136:39.12]I think my game froze.
[136:45.17]Uh-oh.
[136:47.01]Wow.
[136:47.11]Alright.
[136:49.01]That's not going to be enough.
[136:49.69]We're going to have to put some brakes here.
[136:59.40]So right when it gets off here, we need brakes right there.
[137:03.11]We're going to have to have brakes on the whole track.
[137:14.40]Stop making fun of my 780.
[137:15.30]Alright.
[137:19.36]Brakes.
[137:22.07]No.
[137:22.89]Come on.
[137:25.95]This is just chugging right now.
[137:29.91]What the hell is going on right now?
[137:31.76]What happened?
[137:34.80]Just put brakes everywhere.
[137:36.82]I didn't even tell it to do that.
[137:41.00]Okay.
[137:41.16]Okay.
[137:43.05]Yeah, I put them all over the place.
[137:44.39]Perfect.
[137:49.67]Even my laptop has a 1060.
[137:52.49]Come on.
[137:55.32]I'm going to upgrade soon.
[137:56.48]Look, perfect.
[138:00.32]That's going to work.
[138:01.40]Start the test.
[138:04.58]Except right here is not good at all.
[138:09.72]We'll have to see.
[138:16.06]Here comes the loud noise again.
[138:17.32]Just put a brick wall up.
[138:22.88]Hey, look, I can read like subs.
[138:24.91]This works.
[138:26.65]Thank you, Contempo135, TwitchyDove, for nine months and two months, respectively.
[138:30.51]SketchyDragon, ten months, any chance we could see some Man o' War soon?
[138:35.55]Uh, yeah.
[138:36.88]When they do another large update, it's still in alpha.
[138:39.30]So, once we get an update to the game, I will gladly go play it again to fight more monsters.
[138:43.50]Absolutely.
[138:45.29]AceTech09, Baldur92, TJ Mason, Circular Fry, just dubs, thank you, Circular Fry.
[138:52.48]Hypothermic for 10 months, Hypo.
[138:54.02]There's gonna be corpses riding up to the entrance.
[138:58.40]Probably.
[139:00.04]But thanks, Hypo.
[139:01.35]One of the long-term mods that have been here for a long time.
[139:03.51]Thanks a lot, dude.
[139:05.73]Alright, slow it down.
[139:08.99]Uh, ScrumpleDunkus, thank you for the sub.
[139:10.60]BoneMonger, 127 for 9 months.
[139:13.64]Welcome back, dude.
[139:15.58]Goopkin for 2 months.
[139:17.96]Seasaurus for 7 months.
[139:19.00]Jeremy, have you ever thought of making a WoW guild?
[139:21.96]I don't really play WoW that much anymore.
[139:24.26]I streamed the worst stream I've ever done.
[139:27.48]We've talked about that before.
[139:29.42]That Karazhan stream is the worst stream I have ever done.
[139:32.79]It's gonna get real loud.
[139:34.09]So you're gonna have to bear with me for a second here.
[139:37.71]5 G's, 6 G's.
[139:40.97]Okay, we can fix that.
[139:43.63]We can fix it.
[139:45.17]We're back to normal here.
[139:48.31]This ride is so bad.
[139:49.65]60, 70, don't go fast on that step.
[139:54.83]Brake every two seconds.
[139:58.03]This is fucking terrible.
[140:00.97]Come on!
[140:02.33]Alright.
[140:04.21]What are the results?
[140:09.54]It'll be fine.
[140:14.82]It's that stupid section.
[140:18.84]This one section here.
[140:21.14]Use brakes.
[140:22.18]It's covered in brakes.
[140:23.90]I need to put brakes up here.
[140:29.48]Right here.
[140:30.10]Can I add brakes?
[140:33.10]No.
[140:33.48]Can I add brakes here?
[140:36.35]No.
[140:36.53]What about right here?
[140:39.05]No, what about right here?
[140:42.17]Uh, this can't exist in its current state.
[140:48.71]I love how every change I make to this rollercoaster makes it even shittier.
[140:52.53]Because it started off as like a joke rollercoaster, and now that I actually have to make it real so people will go to it, it sucks.
[141:01.20]It's just, uh, go down.
[141:04.87]Good, huh?
[141:05.43]What a creative streamer.
[141:08.15]Look, you guys.
[141:08.93]One, two, three, four.
[141:09.95]And it goes down.
[141:10.63]I might just delete this whole fucking thing and work on this one.
[141:17.49]No one's gonna ride this anyways because it goes up too high.
[141:19.54]This goes up to like a skyscraper.
[141:21.62]No one wants to ride that.
[141:26.06]What was I thinking?
[141:26.66]Alright, get rid of this.
[141:31.98]Let's make it like the boring up-down.
[141:36.43]This way goes everything down.
[141:39.19]See?
[141:43.24]Cool.
[141:46.14]Now what's it gonna do?
[141:47.00]Watch it goes one, two, three, and then turns into a shitty coaster.
[141:50.18]Cool.
[141:59.67]Alright, here we go.
[142:05.78]Mommy, I want to ride the roller coaster.
[142:08.42]Look.
[142:10.38]It's better now.
[142:16.73]Go back to... No, that's going to be bad.
[142:20.25]No, this way.
[142:25.80]Yeah, okay.
[142:26.28]It's not going to be going as fast as you think it will.
[142:32.62]This doesn't even need to exist.
[142:34.68]This section does not have to exist.
[142:39.28]Alright, autocomplete.
[142:42.82]There we go.
[142:43.48]I don't think it's going to go that fast.
[142:50.67]It's not going to go that fast, so this doesn't matter.
[142:54.43]Term is mad part slinky.
[142:56.95]It's not going to be going fast enough for this to be an issue.
[142:59.90]Yeah.
[143:02.78]But just in case, I'm going to move this a little.
[143:06.96]Like that.
[143:10.96]Okay.
[143:12.85]Let's try it.
[143:14.15]Test it.
[143:23.51]What a piece of shit.
[143:26.39]One G-Force is ten pounds?
[143:28.88]Well, look!
[143:30.24]To just, like, wear a vest!
[143:34.59]Wear a vest, you'll be fine.
[143:36.47]Just carry a bulletproof vest with you into the park.
[143:39.61]So your chest doesn't decompress.
[143:41.01]Alright, this should have done it.
[143:44.24]Because it only picks up speed, really, on like the fourth spin.
[143:52.56]Okay, we're fine.
[143:53.86]I've watched that.
[143:54.52]This works.
[143:58.06]Yeah, just go, go, go.
[143:59.22]It's white right here's a concern.
[144:00.32]Here's a concern.
[144:02.28]Alright, that needs to change and then we're good.
[144:06.56]This is fine.
[144:11.53]No excitement at all.
[144:13.77]Zero.
[144:16.91]Zero excitement.
[144:18.23]Alright, now just move this.
[144:22.17]This is going to be real boring.
[144:27.15]No, no, no.
[144:33.06]Go back, back, back.
[144:33.92]I can do this.
[144:34.48]I can do this.
[144:44.04]Go like that.
[144:49.27]Spread it out even more down here.
[144:58.59]Yeah, keep going.
[145:06.96]Is that enough spreading?
[145:10.12]No, definitely not.
[145:11.10]This pearl is out.
[145:18.96]It's hard to be excited when you're dead.
[145:20.28]Well, it wouldn't even die.
[145:26.02]Fuck the guy that made this coaster like this.
[145:28.66]It's me.
[145:29.14]I made this.
[145:30.56]What am I talking about?
[145:32.74]Fuck the guy that made the coaster like this.
[145:34.35]I'm talking about me.
[145:37.43]I made it.
[145:39.25]I just got mad at a non-existent entity that made this coaster and it was me that fucking made it.
[145:44.73]What a psycho.
[145:48.24]Psycho.
[145:50.14]Fuck the guy that made this.
[145:52.63]Me.
[145:52.93]Let's try it again.
[145:58.23]C, C, C, C, C. He's crazy.
[146:15.56]Silky smooth.
[146:20.38]Uh, any more subs?
[146:22.26]Of course.
[146:23.52]Uh, Johannes J. Uh, Jarek, Jarek or Brian.
[146:28.25]Jarek Orpian.
[146:30.51]Slow roller coasters.
[146:31.55]This is, this is not a slow roller coaster.
[146:32.99]This is a fast one.
[146:35.31]Thank you, Leleys for six months.
[146:36.49]Caesar Salad, Epic Vin, Born Nerfed.
[146:40.65]Uh, Evo Sigma 1, Leno 589.
[146:42.64]Thanks for ten months and five months, respectively.
[146:46.16]And that catches us up.
[146:48.48]What about bits?
[146:49.02]Any bits?
[146:49.90]Oh, we had some bits.
[146:51.30]Thanks for the bits.
[146:52.92]Fuck yeah.
[146:55.34]Thanks, guys.
[146:55.90]Alright, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[147:00.94]Make it work.
[147:01.40]Make it work.
[147:02.28]Make it happen.
[147:06.31]Even if this doesn't work, I'm moving on because I need to continue my park and I'm just going to rage delete this coaster.
[147:14.81]Three.
[147:16.43]Four.
[147:16.79]Alright, that is fixed.
[147:19.73]That one is fixed.
[147:22.07]Shit!
[147:23.34]Fuck, that stupid, like, snake turn.
[147:29.24]God damn it!
[147:30.50]No!
[147:35.14]Ah, I'll deal with you later.
[147:36.50]Fuck off.
[147:44.78]I somehow made it happen more often!
[147:49.10]Fuck!
[147:50.30]UGH!
[147:53.58]Shit, this park is so dirty!
[147:55.96]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[147:57.54]Wasn't I complaining about dirt?
[147:59.14]I need more trash bins.
[148:00.10]Pretend that whole fucking last 30 minutes didn't happen.
[148:14.67]Here's a magic trick.
[148:15.33]Here's a magic trick for you.
[148:22.58]Where'd it go?
[148:30.99]Where'd it go?
[148:47.02]Fucking stupid.
[149:05.48]Test this one!
[149:06.08]No, I wonder if this one has cheese.
[149:08.52]What cheese does this one have?
[149:19.04]Is it too many G's or are people going to be so sick on this ride?
[149:22.84]Look at this piece of shit.
[149:27.45]Oh wow, what a great coaster.
[149:32.19]Only like the 1.8 G's or something stupid.
[149:38.93]Wow, now people are going to be so excited to ride that ride.
[149:41.14]Okay, I just deleted somebody accidentally.
[149:50.06]What was it?
[149:50.58]L?
[149:54.56]People are going to line up to ride this ride for miles.
[150:00.24]And it's not even the Slinky.
[150:04.90]That makes me so upset.
[150:11.04]Go ahead, ride it.
[150:11.60]Yeah, look at... Oh, wow!
[150:12.46]This is so much fun!
[150:13.32]Oh, I'm kind of afraid.
[150:14.20]No.
[150:15.60]Open it.
[150:17.92]Oh, it's the name of the ride.
[150:18.64]Do you guys know the name of this ride?
[150:20.06]Okay.
[150:21.86]Uh, what do I, what do I name it?
[150:40.83]Oh.
[150:41.25]Oh, wow, did you see the new thing that opened over there?
[150:43.05]Yeah, I saw it.
[150:45.39]It's so cool looking.
[150:46.15]Let's all go.
[150:46.90]I can't wait to ride that fucking ride.
[150:54.31]Here they all come.
[150:55.73]With their trash.
[151:03.08]Is this guy... The guy that even works here is going to ride it.
[151:08.83]Or maybe he isn't.
[151:09.99]How much is this thing?
[151:17.53]$8.99.
[151:18.67]I swear to God, if people get in line for this at $8.99, I'm going to be real mad.
[151:24.97]I didn't get to kill people, where?
[151:28.87]$8 and they're gonna get in line.
[151:31.03]People are like, I was sprinting to get over here.
[151:36.05]Blame you are all of us is poor value.
[151:41.58]The person has $160 in their wallet.
[151:44.62]You can fuck off.
[151:46.80]Look, the guy with $32 in his pocket is still gonna ride it.
[151:49.64]Yeah.
[151:49.80]What are you gonna spend your $160 on?
[151:55.97]Look at this.
[151:56.85]That's not even 10% of what you own!
[151:58.39]$400!
[151:58.41]Fine, you want it to be like half off?
[152:09.96]There.
[152:12.67]No, fuck.
[152:13.27]That's $400.
[152:13.57]Four hundred bucks.
[152:23.89]Oh, I wonder how much fun we're gonna have.
[152:25.17]Let's ride it.
[152:26.33]Whoa.
[152:28.46]Oh, look, I put my hands in the air.
[152:31.30]Wow.
[152:34.08]Cool.
[152:34.58]This was so much fun.
[152:45.27]How much money do you fucking have?
[152:49.71]When this guy gets out.
[152:54.95]Where is he?
[152:55.29]Right here?
[152:57.79]There he is.
[152:58.39]$135.
[153:00.13]Thanks for spending the money.
[153:01.05]This guy spent 60 bucks so far.
[153:03.66]Good.
[153:04.10]It works.
[153:05.16]$4.
[153:05.32]Fine.
[153:07.14]Can I even salvage this piece of shit over here?
[153:09.16]No, we gotta do some scenery.
[153:11.02]This place is awful.
[153:12.36]Scenery.
[153:13.50]We need some more trash.
[153:14.64]Sci-fi trash cans.
[153:15.92]That doesn't matter.
[153:16.88]As long as people have a place to put their trash.
[153:22.47]Well, they're waiting in line right before they get in line.
[153:25.71]to obviously the most popular ride in the whole park.
[153:30.60]This is a ghost town up here, but thank God Mr. Pancake is still being good.
[153:33.92]Let's give him another raise.
[153:36.40]He's the only entertaining thing in this whole damn park at the moment.
[153:41.00]I'm pretty excited for that.
[153:45.70]Alright, I need some more attractions over here.
[153:51.56]After I do some scenery.
[153:52.38]Let's do... Um...
[153:56.70]A giant burger top?
[154:01.46]Statues.
[154:04.00]Art.
[154:04.24]Special effects.
[154:12.80]We're going to have cool explosion effects over here for people online.
[154:20.52]That would kill them, wouldn't it?
[154:23.18]Apparently not.
[154:25.37]This is the most popular ride, so why not?
[154:27.05]Have cool explosion effects.
[154:28.43]Alright, there's a big fire over here.
[154:32.59]No.
[154:33.69]Flamethrower.
[154:40.08]No, we want... Fountain.
[154:45.18]That's kind of cool.
[154:50.18]Engine thrusting.
[154:53.04]Can I buy you love?
[154:56.15]There's a lot of shit here.
[154:59.90]Bathroom needs effects?
[155:01.02]That's true.
[155:02.58]Thank you for that suggestion.
[155:09.66]Uh, oil spray.
[155:12.37]Yeah, I want people to think there's, like, shit coming up from the pipes.
[155:17.61]Like, how disgusting.
[155:19.01]What is that?
[155:20.47]Oh my, yeah, is that shit?
[155:22.31]Yeah, it is.
[155:24.64]And I also want people to think that this place is on fire.
[155:33.47]No, no stream jet.
[155:35.19]Uh, Sparks?
[155:41.68]Can I, like, aim this so they walk in and get sprayed in the face like a clown would do?
[155:48.52]Raise, lower.
[155:49.14]Can I, like, move it?
[155:50.30]How do I make it so it faces the other way?
[155:54.49]Like pointing that way.
[155:58.89]Rotate.
[155:59.87]Rotate 90 degrees.
[156:01.99]Raise lower.
[156:05.45]I can't make it face the other way.
[156:06.73]It's kind of lame.
[156:12.09]I'm sure I can.
[156:14.76]How many Gs in the bathroom line?
[156:16.68]Oh, it's X. Okay, cool.
[156:21.66]Is it X?
[156:23.36]This isn't even doing anything.
[156:31.52]Hex just spins it.
[156:35.76]Oh.
[156:36.08]What?
[156:40.08]There we go.
[156:47.59]And there we are.
[156:54.81]Spray people right in the fucking face.
[156:56.39]Okay.
[157:04.32]Wait, what?
[157:05.25]Why is this hovering in the air?
[157:08.11]Hold on, hold on.
[157:08.97]Wait, wait, wait.
[157:12.07]What an obnoxious fucking bathroom this is.
[157:29.46]Why?
[157:30.06]Why am I doing this?
[157:36.72]This doesn't seem like a smart thing to do to people.
[157:52.57]Aim it down so I can shoot down.
[157:54.21]There we go.
[158:08.32]People in the ladies' room.
[158:11.00]Alright, that's good.
[158:11.62]We're gonna move this one, though.
[158:19.10]This one's gonna be, like, right in front of people's face.
[158:22.62]Right there.
[158:28.53]You wanna go to the bathroom?
[158:30.01]Good luck.
[158:31.85]This is gonna be fire here, too.
[158:39.47]Alright.
[158:40.39]Have fun going to the bathroom.
[158:44.05]Oh shit!
[158:45.01]Ah!
[158:47.27]It's an obstacle course to get to the bathroom!
[158:57.52]The music makes it better.
[158:58.56]Makes it much better.
[159:04.99]Let's get this, like, actually snapped.
[159:06.85]Attach this to here.
[159:14.05]Alright, what about, uh, anything else I can do to torment these people?
[159:20.32]How about, like, loud noises?
[159:25.42]Aw, Jet.
[159:27.56]Yeah, can't you do, like, speaker?
[159:34.58]What does that do?
[159:36.16]Am I just gonna blast music at people?
[159:46.37]Pitch.
[159:47.33]Silent.
[159:47.99]Activate on trigger?
[159:59.16]No.
[159:59.72]I think I have to have a trigger.
[160:07.91]Siren.
[160:10.41]How do I make these work?
[160:15.57]You can really add custom sounds?
[160:17.21]That's fucking awesome.
[160:19.79]So activate on trigger.
[160:22.90]Not exactly sure what that means.
[160:37.76]They're all playing different songs.
[160:44.56]Okay, I guess this is intense enough.
[160:52.75]I'm just annoying people that want to go to the bathroom.
[160:56.19]Alright, that's enough.
[161:00.96]That's enough of that.
[161:02.14]We took care of that.
[161:09.30]Go play Ghost Master?
[161:14.11]Look at how popular this ride is.
[161:15.71]That makes me so angry.
[161:19.99]Why are you so focused on the bathroom?
[161:21.59]I don't know.
[161:21.93]That's a good question.
[161:25.13]Alright.
[161:32.14]Let's add another ride.
[161:33.36]Just a regular one.
[161:36.14]We don't have any gentle rides.
[161:41.80]Let's put a ferris wheel here.
[161:43.08]Like, right here.
[161:45.28]Let me take a bigger look at the park.
[161:50.74]Oh boy, this is bad.
[161:54.76]This is real bad.
[162:01.01]Alright.
[162:01.89]To you 2,700 people that are here right now, I'm ashamed and embarrassed for the purposes, and I'll tell you why.
[162:09.15]when you have a game that you play and you like you know let's say some of you guys are really good at this game and you're really like interesting and you make all kinds of designs and you put different coasters and you spend a bunch of time and then your little brother comes over and wants to play after four hours this is what he comes up with that's what I'm doing right now I'm your little brother playing the game
[162:33.24]I made a snail, it didn't... I can't make a roller coaster!
[162:38.44]It just wouldn't even work.
[162:39.61]It just wouldn't heal though.
[162:43.29]Thanks for letting me play, big brother.
[162:49.55]That's what this is.
[162:51.31]You're watching your little brother play Planet Coaster right now.
[162:55.80]I hope it's entertaining.
[163:08.83]Alright, let's go.
[163:09.91]We got progress.
[163:21.15]This roller coaster doesn't even work.
[163:32.30]This over here doesn't even go anywhere.
[163:34.32]I just made this.
[163:36.74]Do you like it?
[163:39.57]God damn it.
[163:41.91]Oh, I'm so bad at this.
[163:43.79]I'm so bad at making theme parks.
[163:45.15]I'm having fun, though.
[163:46.13]At least I'm having fun.
[163:48.17]Let me fix this one.
[163:50.61]Let's test it so I can fix it, and then we'll move on to making the park better.
[163:54.55]It'll be a better park.
[163:58.91]We'll make it a little bit better.
[164:00.33]No, don't do that.
[164:03.38]Do this.
[164:07.86]Now it's broken.
[164:08.50]The ride's broken.
[164:12.09]Mom, Jeremy won't give me my back planet coaster.
[164:14.97]Jeremy won't give me back planet coaster.
[164:16.19]He's been doing it for like hours.
[164:20.33]I thought this was a good game until I saw this part.
[164:24.75]Hey, we're making progress.
[164:26.19]How long does it take to make a park in this game?
[164:27.67]Like 25 hours?
[164:29.59]We're not even like two hours into this.
[164:33.20]I got a long way to go, but I'm hogging the crayons right now.
[164:40.29]I would have handed you an unplugged controller.
[164:42.53]Yeah, you give me an unplugged controller and you keep playing and he's sitting there with like the dumbest look on his face like, look, I'm playing.
[164:53.55]And he wouldn't even know.
[164:54.31]I wouldn't even know.
[164:54.93]Alright, how bad is this ride?
[165:01.29]Alright, let me... Jeez.
[165:02.09]Okay, that's okay.
[165:07.55]That's okay.
[165:10.17]Where does it go wrong?
[165:14.33]I don't understand why this goes so wrong.
[165:16.45]Right there.
[165:17.57]And right there.
[165:18.13]Okay, I can fix that.
[165:22.52]And right there.
[165:23.94]And right there.
[165:29.28]Look, I didn't know I had to be worried about Gs.
[165:32.56]And right there.
[165:34.96]So this is a disaster.
[165:36.02]This one will never work.
[165:42.28]Open the Ferris wheel.
[165:44.66]Open the Ferris wheel.
[165:45.46]You got it.
[165:48.18]It's open.
[165:51.00]250.
[165:51.30]250.
[165:51.60]Just smooth everything out.
[165:56.37]How do I smooth everything?
[165:59.19]Is there a button I can press to do that?
[166:04.15]Where's the smooth all?
[166:09.35]Get the whole ride selected.
[166:10.83]Smooth all.
[166:13.25]Okay, that was smooth.
[166:20.07]Alright, select it all.
[166:20.79]And then we're going to smooth the whole thing.
[166:24.15]I'm going to smear butter all over this coaster.
[166:29.34]Is it all selected?
[166:29.94]Not quite.
[166:32.30]Okay.
[166:33.38]Smooth all.
[166:39.70]What?
[166:40.62]Oh, I fucked it up.
[166:44.00]Yeah.
[166:45.74]Smooth.
[166:51.36]Looks like it got... Looks like nothing happened.
[166:57.80]Smooth?
[167:03.78]I'm not gonna lie, I was too dumb to figure out how to select the whole track, so you're saying that I'm a better rollercoaster builder than you.
[167:09.90]That's what you're saying.
[167:17.81]Okay, let me drag this.
[167:21.93]So, if I knew that the G's was an issue, I thought I could just make a fun little rollercoaster.
[167:29.76]No.
[167:30.18]And now that I know that I have to be concerned about that, then I can make one that's not going to kill anybody.
[167:38.92]The big problem is down here when they go around right here.
[167:42.66]So this has to be low.
[167:43.60]What did I tell you?
[167:49.01]I think that'll be a little bit better.
[167:56.21]I don't know.
[167:57.63]Who knows?
[167:58.42]I have no idea.
[168:03.26]Hey, make sure you follow the stream.
[168:05.02]Make sure you check out my other streams.
[168:07.42]I'm a gamer.
[168:07.94]You know, I play games.
[168:09.70]Make sure you follow the stream.
[168:10.68]I hope you're enjoying yourself.
[168:18.98]Hope you're enjoying the stream.
[168:20.92]Hope it's fun.
[168:22.46]Smooth it.
[168:27.47]I just have to keep doing this.
[168:29.31]And eventually it'll be smooth enough where it'll work.
[168:34.79]You know, I play all kinds of stuff.
[168:36.00]I'm like a variety guy.
[168:36.98]I play, like, games.
[168:40.51]Hey, I beat Dark Souls 3.
[168:42.83]Right?
[168:43.07]I did it on stream.
[168:44.83]So, I mean, if you came to the stream and you're wondering, like, I fucking hate this guy.
[168:48.84]He says he sucks.
[168:50.42]I beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[168:53.68]You know anybody else that ever did that in their life?
[168:57.80]I can't name very many.
[168:59.61]I beat it in like three days on stream.
[169:00.95]I beat that game in three days.
[169:01.97]I beat Dark Souls 3 on stream in about four days.
[169:05.67]Blind.
[169:06.53]When the game released.
[169:08.31]I didn't get a Wikipedia to tell me where to go.
[169:12.06]I didn't get anything to tell me, oh, here's where you pick up this particular item.
[169:15.12]Blind.
[169:15.86]Nobody told me what to do.
[169:16.90]And I beat it in like three days.
[169:21.58]Which, by the way, oh, did I mention?
[169:24.08]I beat Dancer of the Boreal Valley first try.
[169:26.65]I beat the Champion Gundyr first try.
[169:29.61]You know what I'm saying?
[169:34.31]Like, this is a stream that you're going to want to be around.
[169:37.33]Don't take this as a bad stream.
[169:44.96]Okay, can I test this now?
[169:46.88]See if it worked.
[169:49.13]I like to, like, justify people being here.
[169:52.23]Like, if you just came in, like, no, no, no, you see, I beat Dark Souls.
[169:56.16]That means I'm okay.
[169:57.42]I need to... Oh!
[170:00.06]No, what are you doing?
[170:02.74]What happened?
[170:08.60]Oh, God.
[170:09.70]Thank fucking God.
[170:10.84]Did I tell you that I beat Dark Souls 3?
[170:16.07]That's a hard game.
[170:17.49]And I did it.
[170:18.05]I beat it.
[170:22.69]Okay, we're good.
[170:30.32]More smoothing.
[170:34.62]Where's the cart?
[170:36.90]Get up here.
[170:50.24]This is fun.
[170:51.64]I'm actually having fun.
[170:54.16]Don't let my... I'm just kidding.
[170:55.90]I'm just pretending.
[170:56.66]You know what I mean?
[170:58.60]Beats Dark Souls 3.
[170:59.54]Can't smooth a roller coaster.
[171:05.26]Come on.
[171:05.70]Please not.
[171:06.24]That guy that told me to smooth everything.
[171:10.37]He was right.
[171:11.47]That was 6 Gs.
[171:11.99]8 Gs.
[171:12.29]Okay.
[171:14.33]Okay.
[171:21.03]Eight... Eight G's?
[171:24.65]Eight G's?
[171:27.63]That guy's a hero.
[171:28.45]Ten G's.
[171:28.85]We didn't smooth this enough.
[171:32.57]It's done.
[171:33.05]This one's gonna work.
[171:33.85]I just have to smooth.
[171:34.45]What does it go to here?
[171:38.41]Ten G's?
[171:38.83]Smooth it.
[171:39.61]We'll be fine.
[171:42.03]That guy's such a hero that told me to do that.
[171:46.47]Check this out.
[171:50.39]Oh, we gotta just smooth the shit out of this.
[172:03.16]Perfect.
[172:04.64]Alright, what was it?
[172:05.10]What else was over here?
[172:05.82]We need to smooth over here too.
[172:12.79]Alright.
[172:16.53]Add some breaks.
[172:18.39]Perfect.
[172:20.50]Watch the test.
[172:26.00]That's making it worse?
[172:26.88]No, it's not.
[172:28.28]It's going to be fine.
[172:28.88]We turned it into a smooth.
[172:38.83]I just read in chat something said you should sell gravestones.
[172:44.09]Sell graves at the entrance.
[172:46.95]I don't know why that tickled me so much.
[172:51.47]Alright, check it out.
[172:53.45]8 G's is gonna be fine.
[172:54.27]That's enough.
[172:54.79]Your skull doesn't cave in at 8 G's.
[172:56.77]Kinda does.
[172:58.73]That's 6 G's now.
[173:02.53]That looks like it's gonna be a successful car ride.
[173:10.38]Ooh, that was close.
[173:12.64]8, 9 G's.
[173:14.22]Put the brakes on.
[173:14.96]7, 6 G's.
[173:17.30]We're upside down.
[173:18.62]Shit, you get stuck upside down.
[173:22.58]Oh, fuck.
[173:23.72]Where is it?
[173:24.24]Where does that happen?
[173:26.40]Too many breaks.
[173:30.38]Fuck.
[173:32.02]I can fix it.
[173:32.46]Hold on.
[173:38.51]I'm currently judging all your streams on your current coaster building ability.
[173:43.03]No, you can't.
[173:43.63]You can't.
[173:44.41]What about the last game I played?
[173:45.69]What did I play last beat Hitman on stream?
[173:50.33]I didn't guess how many points I got.
[173:53.66]How many points did the guy got on that stream?
[173:59.01]Answer is zero.
[174:00.85]Zero.
[174:02.43]Zero points on the Hitman stream.
[174:04.25]I completed each... You know, I beat Dark Souls, though.
[174:07.51]That doesn't matter.
[174:08.19]Yeah, it doesn't matter what you say.
[174:12.65]You can tell me that, like, the Hitman playthrough, I beat it, but, like, oh, wow, you sucked?
[174:15.57]I beat Dark Souls 3 on stream in three days.
[174:19.29]I have my gamer license.
[174:20.37]I'm allowed to have it.
[174:24.88]You can't take my license away from me.
[174:26.20]I lost it when I played Binding of Isaac like four years ago.
[174:29.52]Got it back when I played Dark Souls 3 on stream in three days.
[174:38.96]Oh, man.
[174:40.73]Okay.
[174:41.19]I smoothed it.
[174:42.29]I smoothed it a little.
[174:43.09]This needs to drop, though.
[174:44.51]This whole thing does.
[174:48.15]What if I put it up?
[174:48.97]Because the problem is they're going upside down here.
[174:56.45]I just want this section to go down, not the whole damn thing.
[175:00.95]Why are you doing that?
[175:01.71]I just want this one section.
[175:03.89]Do you not see what I want here?
[175:06.74]Oh, you fucking idiot.
[175:09.36]I'm gonna fucking scream.
[175:13.66]Just kidding.
[175:15.20]No, it's all good, man.
[175:18.92]Hey, like, good or bad, I'm having fun.
[175:21.00]So it doesn't matter.
[175:25.45]Where are those breaks?
[175:27.19]Is that going to be enough?
[175:30.07]Actually, this should probably come down.
[175:33.63]Whoops, sorry.
[175:36.14]Well, you're all dead.
[175:41.62]This can't hang upside down.
[175:42.82]Alright, test it.
[175:50.41]Come on.
[175:51.25]Bring it up.
[175:54.27]Get up there.
[175:57.78]30 seconds slow for suckers.
[175:59.04]What?
[176:03.69]Look, I just have to smooth it.
[176:05.07]Shit, I didn't smooth it.
[176:05.75]He's right.
[176:07.85]Smooth it quick before I get down here.
[176:08.95]Okay.
[176:19.03]Ooh.
[176:23.04]God damn it.
[176:27.85]I did too much smoothing here.
[176:29.53]This needs to come in.
[176:31.40]Take the brakes off this.
[176:34.14]Take these brakes off here.
[176:35.58]Maybe that'll help.
[176:37.76]Take the brakes off this one.
[176:40.78]There we go.
[176:41.66]That's gonna do it.
[176:42.64]Ladies and gentlemen.
[176:44.14]I've completed it.
[176:47.44]Smoothed it.
[176:48.52]It's baby bottom smooth.
[176:52.02]Put a chain on it?
[176:52.66]No, I just had too many brakes.
[177:04.49]Etalyx, what the fuck?
[177:10.25]Something's wrong.
[177:10.81]Something made a noise.
[177:11.47]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[177:14.89]Go to the heat maps.
[177:19.77]Excitement.
[177:22.99]Fear.
[177:23.37]Now I'm scared on this one.
[177:29.27]Lateral.
[177:29.65]Oh, here you can see the Gs.
[177:30.91]Alright, nice.
[177:35.46]It's going to be... That's cool to look at.
[177:37.15]I want to look at that after to make sure this is... I need to make sure this thing actually completes.
[177:42.71]That's important.
[177:46.07]Was it smooth enough?
[177:47.89]Not really, but... I think it'll be okay.
[177:50.27]Come on.
[177:51.90]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[177:54.12]This is... You hang people upside down for this long.
[177:57.78]Take off this brake.
[178:00.40]Sorry.
[178:02.86]You can't hang people upside down for that long.
[178:06.89]Get rid of the breaks.
[178:07.79]They don't need them there.
[178:09.37]They're okay here.
[178:10.09]Now let's take a look at the live heat mapper.
[178:15.24]Alright.
[178:16.92]Lateral G. Right here.
[178:18.44]750.
[178:19.48]That's okay.
[178:20.78]That's within non-death standards.
[178:23.60]Vertical G. Right here.
[178:25.54]7.
[178:27.36]Within scientific guidelines.
[178:29.82]Forward G. We're within science guidelines.
[178:33.60]People are not going to die.
[178:35.08]It's super exciting.
[178:38.00]See?
[178:38.30]This whole time they're excited.
[178:40.75]And then they get to here.
[178:42.71]And they get angry.
[178:44.51]Oh, the ride's over, but look at how much fun they had.
[178:47.11]You know what I'm saying?
[178:49.99]Test it.
[178:50.33]Let's look at the live results.
[178:51.65]Live data.
[178:53.63]Get up here.
[178:54.49]Faster, please.
[178:58.25]It's such a boring ride now.
[178:59.43]No, it isn't.
[178:59.87]This is cool.
[179:01.87]Because you keep thinking you're going to get tongue-tied.
[179:12.23]Thank you for the name.
[179:20.52]Almost.
[179:23.22]And this is where we see if the brakes were the problem.
[179:27.60]Which they probably were.
[179:29.66]Upside down.
[179:30.46]It went backside up.
[179:36.40]First time we've been here in a while.
[179:38.62]Are we going too fast for this bend?
[179:41.34]Nope.
[179:42.99]Perfect.
[179:45.05]We got it.
[179:45.93]We actually made a roller coaster.
[179:47.43]Can you believe it?
[179:50.73]And let's take a look at these fucking numbers.
[179:52.87]Okay.
[179:58.13]Huh.
[180:02.97]It sucks.
[180:04.97]It sucks.
[180:05.53]Nobody will ride it.
[180:09.83]Only nine Gs.
[180:10.92]God.
[180:12.13]Damn it.
[180:16.59]Where's the G list?
[180:18.27]Where's the G list?
[180:19.97]Heat maps.
[180:21.53]What was the problem here?
[180:22.75]Upwards, max G, lateral G. Right here, I guess.
[180:30.29]You fucking wusses.
[180:33.15]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[180:35.43]I don't like that.
[180:36.15]It was too fast.
[180:38.89]Ride sucks.
[180:39.45]Smooth it.
[180:39.89]Yeah, I'm gonna have to smooth the ride out a little bit.
[180:42.88]It's this piece right here.
[180:43.94]Put the brakes on.
[180:46.62]That's not... Is that gonna help?
[180:49.11]I don't know.
[180:52.91]No, no, no.
[180:53.77]Yeah, that's gonna help.
[180:58.57]That's not gonna help.
[181:05.60]How could they be that low of a score for excitement?
[181:07.68]I don't understand.
[181:10.34]Does that make sense to anybody?
[181:12.83]This thing is fucking crazy.
[181:14.89]How could you have no excitement?
[181:19.73]What, is it because it takes too long to get up here?
[181:21.53]People are so bored right now that they don't even, like, this is so bad to them?
[181:26.92]Because watch what happens when they get up to the top.
[181:29.22]Fear, holy shit, this is so scary.
[181:33.68]Why does the excitement drop down to two right here?
[181:36.31]What the fuck are you talking about?
[181:40.68]Yeah, like 8.
[181:43.08]8, 7, 8, 8, 8.
[181:44.02]Fear is okay.
[181:44.82]Nausea is like... Found the problem.
[181:51.06]Yep.
[181:53.82]It's this part here.
[181:54.76]I need to change this and then people will be fine.
[181:58.61]Back to being excited.
[181:59.89]They're still nauseous, but that's okay.
[182:09.11]Do they make it all the way through?
[182:10.11]Yes, they do.
[182:13.25]It's this intersection.
[182:17.34]Sure.
[182:19.62]This has to change because you're not allowed to have a fun pretzel ride.
[182:24.50]People are too scared.
[182:27.38]I'd ride this.
[182:29.04]You guys don't believe me?
[182:31.60]Come to a theme park with me next time I go.
[182:40.41]Come with me to the theme park.
[182:43.27]I'll ride this thing.
[183:06.84]Yeah.
[183:08.29]We'll go to Six Flags.
[183:09.17]We'll do like a field trip.
[183:11.87]Boring coaster.
[183:12.88]Boring coaster.
[183:15.74]We're going to take it like a Six Flags field trip.
[183:18.76]And I'll ride the Superman rider still.
[183:21.12]Alone.
[183:21.38]And then we'll see what you guys have to say.
[183:28.19]You guys won't be like, oh, whoa, he wouldn't have rid that.
[183:30.01]Of course I would have.
[183:32.73]Bet you wouldn't ride it.
[183:33.53]Wait, what?
[183:36.43]Excitement.
[183:38.29]Come on.
[183:39.29]I moved a couple things around.
[183:40.49]Maybe that'll help.
[183:41.01]Here comes excitement.
[183:43.55]Alright, fear.
[183:44.93]Nauseas.
[183:47.03]Doing okay.
[183:52.37]Get off.
[183:52.93]Explode.
[183:53.63]Fuck you, whoever's on the dumb dummies.
[183:55.83]This has got to go.
[184:00.42]Good.
[184:00.84]There.
[184:03.08]Okay, I hope you're happy.
[184:04.28]I hope you're happy, game.
[184:06.36]Because now... Now you get to be boring.
[184:14.74]See if that did it.
[184:16.59]Come on up again.
[184:23.37]Let's get in the car and ride it.
[184:29.91]Speed it up.
[184:37.23]Six Flags New England.
[184:38.15]I actually like that place a lot.
[184:40.81]I haven't been in a very long time, though.
[184:42.31]Alright, this should be good.
[184:49.98]Although, because people aren't going to be... You're not going to be going fast enough.
[184:52.92]40.
[184:56.62]Nice.
[184:58.95]Ah.
[185:01.53]No.
[185:03.65]Stop the test.
[185:06.24]This whole thing has to be redone.
[185:10.49]I'm about to delete this and put a, like, pre-made one again.
[185:13.25]Oh, I just want to have this be fun.
[185:20.94]No fun allowed.
[185:21.68]That's fine.
[185:25.48]I can keep this, actually.
[185:28.96]But I just have to add, like, breaks here.
[185:37.56]Turn it.
[185:37.88]Get rid of that.
[185:47.19]And then just complete it.
[185:51.97]There.
[185:53.87]Can't even call this tongue-tied anymore.
[185:59.05]What the fuck did you just do?
[186:00.29]I don't complete that, you dummy.
[186:05.22]Test it.
[186:07.62]Delete it, then smooth.
[186:09.02]Delete the stream.
[186:14.09]Come on, I'm trying.
[186:20.35]Smooth it, please.
[186:21.29]I am.
[186:22.33]Alright, go on.
[186:28.47]Get up there.
[186:31.37]Don't make the ending uphill.
[186:35.10]What's next for the Serpents faction?
[186:38.40]I don't know.
[186:40.07]Okay.
[186:43.51]There's the loop.
[186:45.81]The G's are in the... But, I mean, that... People will throw up on this, but not die.
[186:50.69]Alright, that was... That was alright.
[186:58.48]This ride sucks.
[187:04.41]And I smoothed it and everything.
[187:07.94]This whole thing has to come down.
[187:19.70]Don't worry.
[187:20.04]I'm going to smooth it.
[187:20.84]Everyone can calm down.
[187:21.80]I'll smooth it.
[187:25.55]That should be better.
[187:27.57]Same with this.
[187:31.82]Oh shit, I'm starting to see ResidentSleeper.
[187:33.46]Fuck.
[187:34.58]What do I do?
[187:36.26]Oh no, I'm starting to bore people.
[187:38.54]What do I do?
[187:38.90]What do I do?
[187:39.46]Smooth it quick.
[187:47.21]Is that good?
[187:49.21]Shit, I'm starting to bore.
[187:50.17]I'm starting to bore people.
[187:52.67]Get down.
[187:53.85]Go, go, go.
[187:54.23]Quick, quick, quick.
[187:54.65]Just test.
[188:00.90]Shit, I'm starting to get bored now.
[188:02.00]I'm going to have to blow something up.
[188:06.22]I'm going to have to blow something up.
[188:09.54]No, I'm fine.
[188:12.85]There's the first one right here.
[188:13.95]This has been smoothed and changed a little.
[188:15.75]Now I should get around.
[188:19.63]What?
[188:21.91]I thought that was this making that noise.
[188:25.63]We're good.
[188:27.17]People throw up right there, but fuck them.
[188:28.77]Who cares?
[188:29.59]We'll clean it up.
[188:44.50]There we go.
[188:44.90]That should help.
[188:50.31]Will that give me enough speed?
[188:51.29]Alright, let's try that now.
[189:05.34]This is gonna come down.
[189:06.40]This is gonna come way down.
[189:18.84]Smooth it out.
[189:22.12]Okay.
[189:23.03]Come on.
[189:25.73]Make a second climber like in the beginning.
[189:27.25]I could do that, but I think this should do it.
[189:30.77]This, though, is... What the fuck happened here?
[189:32.10]I think the break's off of that.
[189:41.26]And I think we're good to go.
[189:43.46]Alright.
[189:43.84]Can I please have my first created coaster?
[189:46.60]Add a boost?
[189:47.36]No.
[189:47.76]Then people will fly off.
[189:50.90]Test it.
[189:51.26]Come on.
[189:51.54]Get up.
[189:53.08]Is there a way I can just make it get to the top here?
[189:55.55]That's what I want to test it from.
[189:56.71]Because I don't care if they're bored here.
[189:57.89]Fuck them.
[190:01.51]Go through a cave?
[190:02.33]I am not advanced enough to do that.
[190:07.01]Squid bones.
[190:07.67]Here's to another smooth seven months.
[190:09.13]Thanks a lot, man.
[190:12.63]The brakes are what were killing it there.
[190:14.89]Oh, fuck.
[190:15.31]They're gonna go upside down and hit their faces on the ground, aren't they?
[190:18.03]That's very close to the ground.
[190:23.77]They're gonna scrape their foreheads into the dirt.
[190:31.57]Oh, they come real close.
[190:37.03]We're back.
[190:39.41]And slowly, slowly making our way up.
[190:43.78]The end of this ride is so lame.
[190:46.12]Look at the excitement.
[190:46.96]At least no one's going to throw up here.
[190:48.06]This is where you get a chance to... You get a chance to hang out.
[191:01.67]God damn it.
[191:04.91]Let me guess.
[191:06.05]It sucks.
[191:07.13]Okay.
[191:08.97]Doesn't suck that bad.
[191:12.04]I think if we just...
[191:15.77]Make this a little more exciting.
[191:18.64]And get the brakes off here.
[191:23.64]And then... Yeah.
[191:28.60]Resident sleep of that.
[191:30.76]We have a completed ride with at least a 4.0.
[191:33.68]It's good to go.
[191:36.42]This is ready to release.
[191:37.20]We're done.
[191:42.50]Just wait for testing and we're done.
[191:44.58]And people will ride it.
[191:49.31]Let's get rid of the breaks in the end and we're good.
[191:59.00]I'll take like a 5 out of 10.
[192:02.36]I'm putting breaks on, aren't I?
[192:04.70]Yes, of course I am.
[192:09.50]Alright, right here.
[192:10.84]Don't need these anymore.
[192:11.79]I think we got boys and girls.
[192:18.02]Sometimes you have to take a bad grade.
[192:19.29]I think that's good.
[192:25.47]It just has to test to be able to go.
[192:30.81]Make your way up there quick, then we can make another ride.
[192:39.48]I mean, the ride's not great.
[192:43.24]Looks like whoever was building it got through about here and then just started drinking.
[192:48.40]Like hard alcohol.
[192:53.84]You know when a spider makes its web and you've seen the spider on drugs thing?
[192:59.22]They started giving the spider drugs right here.
[193:02.17]And then it was just like, Jesus, I don't even know where my web goes.
[193:07.81]Got some little G's there in the end.
[193:12.83]I think that's going to be a good ride.
[193:13.99]We're going to get a good rating on this one.
[193:18.78]What the fuck are they that afraid of?
[193:20.32]They just weren't that afraid.
[193:22.30]Wait, what?
[193:27.00]Why are you so scared right here?
[193:31.10]What?
[193:34.01]Why?
[193:34.87]At the end of the ride?
[193:39.91]You're that scared?
[193:42.49]You're not scared here, but you're scared here.
[193:45.73]Not here, here.
[193:50.31]Well, I'll add brakes here then.
[193:54.00]You guys are seriously fucking bringing me down.
[194:00.74]Scared to die of boredom.
[194:04.74]Is it too fast at the end?
[194:06.12]Really?
[194:06.44]It's going like 40.
[194:07.08]It goes like 20 right here.
[194:10.62]That's going to be good.
[194:12.00]Final test.
[194:12.50]It's done.
[194:14.50]I added brakes.
[194:16.11]Let's get in there and ride it in the front seat.
[194:21.73]Do you remember when I got to look behind you in real life?
[194:23.75]Oh shit, there's a guy with a knife!
[194:26.85]I got him!
[194:29.65]He tried to get me.
[194:30.39]49... 50, this thing goes real fast.
[194:40.18]They puke, everyone gets sick here.
[194:41.64]It's alright.
[194:45.34]That part might be too intense.
[194:46.32]This part might be a little too intense as well.
[194:50.06]Nope.
[194:50.46]It's within guidelines.
[194:58.21]Let's see if this still happens.
[194:59.21]This breaks here.
[195:00.95]Slow him down.
[195:02.37]And perfect.
[195:04.85]What do we got?
[195:05.96]Give me some greens.
[195:06.62]Give me some greens.
[195:08.50]I am okay with this.
[195:09.62]I got a 6 out of 10.

[197:59.02]Remember that part?
[198:02.38]Nice.
[198:03.22]Look at how everyone's so happy with this coaster.
[198:05.18]I'm so glad you guys gave it a good rating.
[198:07.84]Oh, boy.
[198:10.88]Let's see what they do when they get off.
[198:14.86]Alright, that was fun.
[198:18.34]Thanks for coming, guys.
[198:19.96]This is somebody else's stream, chat.
[198:22.14]These are not people watching this stream.
[198:26.11]That's why my stream got to go first.
[198:32.81]Look at these two talking about it.
[198:33.91]There's the guy's dad again.
[198:36.17]Oh, that streamer was terrible.
[198:37.51]That guy sucks.
[198:39.38]Let's never do that again, son.
[198:41.90]And you got this guy back here with the hat on.
[198:45.02]Man, I'm gonna go watch another Planet Coaster stream.
[198:47.32]Fuck this guy.
[198:50.08]Yeah, that guy sucks.
[198:52.24]What the fuck?
[198:52.78]I thought you guys were my friends.
[198:58.81]Alright, it works.
[198:59.57]We're good.
[199:07.46]Alright, let's make another ride.
[199:09.40]Let's make another ride.
[199:14.23]I'm not going to spend another hour making another roller coaster.
[199:16.73]The two that I have... This one is awful.
[199:19.99]This one's cool, but not great.
[199:22.65]We're going to expand the park a little, add some more rides, and get some more... Sanity 1, this broke.
[199:30.04]No, it's been fixed.
[199:33.18]Guest happiness is declining.
[199:36.86]Send somebody to it.
[199:39.14]Why does this look like the share button?
[199:40.64]Like I'm going to public this to Twitter or something.
[199:45.09]Not again.
[199:47.41]Did he make a dick on purpose?
[199:48.95]That's not a dick, that's a snail.
[199:51.37]So you gotta get a bigger version of the park.
[199:54.21]This is a snail.
[199:57.59]Unlimited cash, no challenge?
[200:00.61]It's a challenge.
[200:02.71]It's a mental challenge to see if I can make a theme park.
[200:09.10]No, Peter Dinklage didn't like my rides, so we're gonna expand a little bit over here.
[200:15.29]Mmm Wild blue what the hell does this thing do?
[200:22.24]No, I don't like this thing Fucking then waffle iron.
[200:26.44]Yeah, I'm definitely putting the waffle iron in here somewhere.
[200:28.06]Let's put a leg over here No, there's gonna be like a fountain right here, yeah, that's where the fountain goes Okay, where's the actual entrance to the waffle iron
[200:45.17]I have no idea.
[200:45.63]Is this the front or the back?
[200:47.91]I think this is the front.
[200:53.11]Is it supposed to be exploding?
[200:54.58]Yeah, it's part of the ride.
[200:56.84]It gives you more excitement.
[201:10.61]Alright.
[201:12.57]And then a path.
[201:16.04]Open for business.
[201:17.18]And it's $10.
[201:17.98]Why are they so expensive?
[201:18.72]Nobody will pay this.
[201:20.14]I've been getting complained about that my shit is too expensive.
[201:23.77]Why would I expect people to pay $10 to ride this?
[201:28.83]Alright, now let's get some cool shit in here.
[201:33.01]Scenery.
[201:35.67]Ambience.
[201:36.11]No, we need terrain.

[203:24.14]You don't think this guy's gonna be like the mascot right here?
[203:31.22]How do I make him bigger?
[203:45.11]Can I not make him larger?
[203:53.74]This is my swamp.
[203:58.07]Reset rotation, world access, surface move.
[204:00.99]Can I not grow him in size?
[204:04.61]No, that's not... What the fuck is happening?
[204:08.03]Why did I just have a second one come out of him?
[204:11.92]That's not what I wanted to do.

[204:36.60]That's exciting.
[204:37.36]That's their excitement level.
[204:46.39]Look at that.
[204:48.22]Already has high energy.
[204:53.26]I'm so bored.
[204:57.52]I did warn you this was going to be a boring stream.
[204:59.68]I tried to warn you.
[205:02.89]How can you say it was boring when we had this?
[205:08.49]The one bathroom is just the place where you get annoyed the most.
[205:15.58]I can't believe that's actually a bathroom and that I only have one in this whole dumb park.
[205:19.68]High energy.
[205:20.12]Yes, high energy.
[205:24.77]I want to put like a big fountain here.
[205:27.47]Or a water ride.
[205:30.87]Come on, fountain.
[205:32.69]Statues and centerpieces.
[205:33.89]Lights.
[205:35.49]Arcways.
[205:36.49]Animatronics.
[205:39.17]Are you serious?
[205:43.23]Don't even need to look at anything else.
[205:50.42]That's perfect!
[205:58.08]Nice!
[205:59.24]I have a Criken that comes out of the water and screams at people.
[206:04.53]Look at these, like, tentacles too.
[206:06.25]Right here.
[206:21.10]Alright.
[206:23.36]Oh, no, wait.
[206:24.04]You're breaking my immersion.
[206:25.14]I can see that.
[206:25.98]I don't want to be able to see that.
[206:32.58]Put down.
[206:34.32]Alright, no.
[206:35.00]Still, my immersion still is broken.
[206:39.03]What the fuck?
[206:39.49]Cut it out.
[206:44.49]Perfect.
[206:49.44]Look at every people walk by and they go, what the fuck is that?
[206:54.52]The monster's face is exposed.
[206:59.42]That's not enough water for him to be in there, by the way.
[207:03.68]Is he like a goldfish?
[207:07.37]And he sprays water too.
[207:09.07]Perfect.
[207:09.45]Alright.
[207:12.03]Track rides.
[207:12.55]We're going to have a little kitty kid ride.
[207:18.51]No.
[207:20.87]Um, blueprints.
[207:21.61]Nope.
[207:25.33]What does a little kid ride?
[207:34.06]Uh, transport ride.
[207:36.28]Empty, really.
[207:40.22]That's unfortunate.
[207:44.48]I want to make a child's ride.
[207:46.94]Magic cats.
[207:49.49]Alright, this is a go right here.
[207:56.49]Magic kitty cat.
[207:57.69]This is for the kids.
[208:15.39]Uh, I need to delete this.
[208:31.38]See now, like my park is now kid friendly.
[208:38.73]Shit.
[208:40.25]Go back.
[208:46.91]Alright, slow down.
[208:48.66]Slow down there.
[208:50.18]Where are you going?
[208:51.60]Where are you taking it?
[208:52.42]This is supposed to be the little kid's ride.
[208:58.72]Are you fucking serious?
[209:02.46]It can't figure out how to do this.
[209:06.70]Where are you going?
[209:07.70]Where are you going?
[209:11.74]No, dude.
[209:16.32]What are you doing?
[209:18.79]What are you doing?
[209:34.66]It can't fucking figure it out.
[209:37.84]Come on.
[209:39.90]Close the loop.
[209:43.44]Close the loop.
[209:48.26]Get down there.
[209:49.10]You piece of shit.
[209:54.92]Please complete.
[209:58.65]Whatever happens, I'm doing it.
[210:06.93]Holy shit.
[210:07.77]This is freaking the fuck out.
[210:13.01]I'm going to give this like 30 more seconds.
[210:16.66]Before I can't do it.
[210:18.44]I just wanted to go up this way.
[210:21.48]And it's taking me around the entire park.
[210:22.86]I wonder how much CPU power I'm using right now.
[210:25.32]Probably a shitload.
[210:30.32]Now there are too many G's.
[210:34.32]Do you see what I was trying to do?
[210:37.94]No, this ain't gonna fucking happen.
[210:41.94]This is not happening.
[210:44.00]Like, it's just not gonna work.
[210:49.17]This has to move.
[210:59.80]Like, this has to move and then this has to be deleted.
[211:08.98]Can I do it now?
[211:15.62]Thank God.
[211:16.26]Alright.
[211:16.62]Finally.
[211:17.00]Jesus.
[211:19.26]I just want to make a little kid's ride.
[211:25.13]Yeah, fine.
[211:25.97]Then they get sprayed by the monster when they go by.
[211:29.25]Smooth it.
[211:30.15]Smooth.
[211:30.53]Alright.
[211:32.39]This is for the little kids.
[211:39.92]Uh, now I need to name it.
[211:41.52]Magic Cats.
[211:46.96]Kitty Krat.
[211:49.14]Test it.
[211:51.62]Alright, let's see how intense this ride is.
[211:58.13]Look at how cool this is.
[211:58.95]Look, you go by the shops.
[212:02.99]I'm gonna get sprayed by the monster.
[212:04.19]The kids are gonna be so into this.
[212:16.94]See, look it.
[212:17.94]Oh!
[212:19.28]Watch out!
[212:20.24]Here comes the Criken!
[212:24.04]Oh!
[212:24.18]He sprays at us!
[212:26.59]Fuck, this is for little kids.
[212:28.09]Oops.
[212:30.11]That's alright.
[212:30.63]They'll be fine.
[212:32.03]Look, if a little kid can see this face and not be scared, they'll be fine with the Criken screaming in their face.
[212:41.78]Yeah, this is done.
[212:44.38]No one's going to get in line for this, so it doesn't really matter.
[212:46.36]So we can just place the entrance... What?
[212:57.89]Something wrong?
[212:58.41]What the fuck is going on?
[213:17.40]Alright, KittyKrat is up for business.
[213:22.30]It is gonna be... $1.50 because it sucks.
[213:26.11]Alright, who wants to ride the KittyKrat?
[213:34.47]I need another, uh... janitor.
[213:38.70]I have two janitors.
[213:43.02]Should I pick a robot too?
[213:44.46]Or a dinosaur?
[213:48.07]Guests, attractions, and shops.
[213:51.15]Marketing.
[213:51.91]Start a marketing campaign.
[213:54.40]Definitely going to do a TV comedy show.
[213:59.84]Wait, what?
[214:02.62]Online campaign.
[214:04.58]Print newspaper ad.
[214:05.40]Yeah, let's do a newspaper ad.
[214:09.51]That's $5,000.
[214:10.21]Yeah, get some people in here.
[214:13.45]We need another... We need a princess.
[214:16.51]She's going to be...
[214:19.03]Where should the princess be?
[214:22.23]Right at the front gate?
[214:24.55]Her color scheme matches the two potato pancakes.
[214:32.36]Yep, that works right there.
[214:33.54]She'll wave.
[214:37.00]Just for the kids.
[214:42.06]This person is sprinting to go meet Elsa.
[214:46.02]Next to the bathrooms.
[214:46.84]No, we're going to have two bathroom attendants there.
[214:51.28]Thank you for reminding me.
[214:52.00]We need bathroom attendants.
[214:56.19]Is there any clowns?
[215:01.41]No, we'll just have a T-Rex be the bathroom attendant.
[215:09.23]How do I make it so he has only one pathway?
[215:15.95]Staff camera?
[215:19.29]Okay.
[215:21.31]Overview.
[215:22.45]Training.
[215:22.89]Oh, he's capable.
[215:25.97]No, I can't train him.
[215:28.27]Free roaming.
[215:28.77]No, no, no, no.
[215:29.51]No free roaming.
[215:34.41]Why can I not make him non-free roaming?
[215:42.37]I think he has to not be stupid.
[215:47.46]Work roster?
[215:48.40]Where's the new roster?
[216:02.87]What?
[216:05.57]How do I- What the fuck is happening?
[216:09.54]How do I put a guy in here?
[216:10.74]Do I have to select him too?
[216:18.80]Come here!
[216:22.80]I don't get it.
[216:23.56]I have no idea.
[216:23.94]I don't even care.
[216:27.96]So how do I like assign somebody to a work roster?
[216:33.74]My new roster.
[216:36.03]Zero staff members.
[216:37.67]How do you add a staff member?
[216:46.53]What a fucking idiot!
[216:48.49]Get over here!
[216:56.05]There we go.
[216:56.79]Get over there.
[216:59.83]You're only allowed to be in the toilet.
[217:02.41]That's it.
[217:03.83]Have fun.
[217:07.55]Use the toilet.
[217:08.05]We're gonna have two toilet monsters.
[217:09.51]That makes sense, right?
[217:13.81]Uh, hire staff.
[217:16.76]There's a robot, too.
[217:26.31]He just gets in the way.
[217:30.23]Where's the dinosaur?
[217:33.67]Excuse me, you're not supposed to be over here.
[217:35.27]You're supposed to be entertaining people going in and out of the bathroom.
[217:40.88]$200 a month to be a toilet dinosaur.
[217:44.32]That does seem pretty low.
[217:46.20]It does seem pretty low.
[217:47.10]Anybody riding the kiddie car?
[217:52.42]No.
[217:52.98]Why?
[217:56.46]Only one car?
[217:58.96]Hold on.
[218:00.91]That doesn't seem right.
[218:04.99]Train speed number of cars?
[218:08.35]Make it go fucking faster than that.
[218:09.83]Fifteen.
[218:12.06]Five miles per hour.
[218:12.92]Give me a break.
[218:17.82]There.
[218:18.04]There's your shitty ride.
[218:22.09]Did I add some excitement to it, I think?
[218:24.15]I hope I did.
[218:26.67]Let's see what happened.
[218:27.33]Yeah.
[218:27.89]Made it much better.
[218:28.55]Okay, I gotta edit the ride and make it so I can have more than one cart.
[218:32.98]That's uncalled for.
[218:34.14]God, I gotta close the ride.
[218:37.22]Fuck off, everybody, for a minute.
[218:40.54]Okay, I wanna add the carts.
[218:44.98]So... I know how to do that.
[218:48.74]Let me know.
[218:50.81]Do I have to add another station?
[218:53.85]I think I do.
[218:55.37]Well... This thing is gonna be such a piece of shit.
[219:14.66]Entry right, exit right.
[219:16.42]No, that.
[219:20.48]I can't... Okay.
[219:22.10]Alright.
[219:22.58]Apparently that didn't even matter.
[219:26.25]How do I add another station here?
[219:32.13]Oh.
[219:32.81]Sorry.
[219:33.11]I'm stupid.
[219:36.31]Okay.
[219:36.81]I need... Now I want to add more cars.
[219:48.30]Okay.
[219:49.44]Good.
[219:50.14]That's good.
[219:53.04]Go on.
[219:53.86]Come on.
[219:54.62]Let me have this as an assembly line here.
[219:58.59]Come on.
[219:59.17]Quick.
[220:00.53]It's just a traffic simulator.
[220:15.45]Traffic cats.
[220:21.97]Have fun.
[220:26.81]I got sprayed by the monster.
[220:28.13]Let's see how exciting this is for these people.
[220:37.91]Overview.
[220:44.37]This is going to be so bad.
[220:47.17]Don't listen to Etalyx.
[220:48.10]What did he say?
[220:48.56]I didn't even see it.
[220:55.01]At least they're on the ride longer.
[220:56.28]This is like the conversation ride.
[221:01.32]Customize.
[221:04.66]We have to have... No, no music.
[221:06.72]Alright, let's see.
[221:10.48]Okay, there they go.
[221:11.60]These people are still here.
[221:12.50]They're still waiting.
[221:16.95]I can't wait to open this back up for business.
[221:21.15]This is gonna be fantastic.
[221:25.04]Uh, let me move this.
[221:26.79]This is one of the longest rides in the park.
[221:37.65]Oh, fuck!
[221:39.01]No, it's facing the wrong way!
[221:41.68]Oh, shit in my goddamn diaper.
[221:45.50]Hold on.
[221:58.87]Oh shit!
[222:02.77]What happened?
[222:03.93]What happened?
[222:05.49]What happened?
[222:06.39]Why?
[222:22.63]I didn't do anything.
[222:23.62]I didn't do anything.
[222:29.46]I'm just trying to smooth it.
[222:34.06]I'm trying to smooth... This too.
[222:39.33]I just made landmines.
[222:42.65]Okay, I can't do anything.
[222:44.31]I can't do anything.
[222:45.65]I have to just fucking... Start the test.
[222:50.73]Done.
[222:52.26]Place and entrance.
[222:54.44]Jesus.
[222:57.76]Place and exit.
[222:59.98]Ugh.
[223:03.14]No!
[223:03.60]No!
[223:04.50]I thought it said both exiting on this side!
[223:08.69]Isn't that what I did?
[223:09.47]Entry, left, ugh.
[223:14.53]Entry... Entry right, exit right.
[223:22.40]I don't know how many more times I can get away with doing that shit.
[223:31.45]Oh my fucking god.
[223:33.43]Why?
[223:34.29]Why are you doing this?
[223:44.35]The arrows.
[223:45.23]Look at the fucking arrows.
[223:46.55]Look at the arrows.
[223:47.11]The arrows are screwing me up.
[223:48.05]Come on now.
[223:53.85]Done.
[223:54.11]That should be it.
[223:56.32]My God.
[224:00.91]Alright, we're fine.
[224:05.75]Jesus Christ.
[224:16.44]Of all the things in this stupid fucking park that have killed hundreds of people.
[224:22.66]It's the little kitty cat ride.
[224:27.40]This was supposed to be a dumb ride for kids and it's killed 300 people.
[224:31.71]And heaven forbid anybody dies on this thing.
[224:34.23]No, that's totally safe.
[224:39.83]And they can't figure out how to leave the grass.
[224:43.49]Help me.
[224:47.22]Okay, here.
[224:47.66]You want me to help you?
[224:50.44]Like, are you seriously all that stupid?
[224:53.02]No, it's just deleting them.
[224:55.48]Okay.
[224:56.82]Well, bye.
[224:58.17]Thanks for coming.
[225:03.35]Thanks for coming to the park.
[225:07.75]Fucking idiots.
[225:09.39]God, I didn't want you anyways.
[225:19.82]No, hold on.
[225:20.22]I want to change this.
[225:29.87]I want the exit to be over here.
[225:31.23]And the entrance to be over here.
[225:43.62]Alright, let's do this.
[225:55.05]Alright, is the kitty cat ride ready to open for business?
[226:02.74]I think it is.
[226:04.34]Except the person... How long is the ride?
[226:05.72]This is ridiculous.
[226:09.14]This person still hasn't got it.
[226:10.24]It's still not testing.
[226:11.24]This is the first person that got on.
[226:13.40]This ride is like 30 minutes long.
[226:16.72]Okay, you could walk.
[226:19.26]You didn't even have to get on the ride.
[226:21.15]You could walk around this park here 25 times to ride this ride once.
[226:30.31]This ride serves no purpose.
[226:35.86]It's just gonna get people stuck.
[226:39.03]This is like dumb stuff.
[226:40.17]This is fucking stupid.
[226:44.83]Hold on.
[226:45.25]Wait till they get over.
[226:45.95]See how... No fucking way.
[226:53.78]No fucking way.
[226:56.10]Are you guys looking at the excitement meter?
[226:58.70]This is gonna be better than the roller coaster.
[227:03.20]You gotta be kidding me.
[227:06.67]I'm not gonna... I will not believe this if it's true.
[227:14.89]Don't even fucking tell me.
[227:16.65]Look at that.
[227:17.23]When they get in the bump.
[227:20.92]I swear to God.
[227:31.06]This ride's more fun than the roller coaster.
[227:39.01]Five, four, one.
[227:42.07]Right?
[227:47.92]This is just barely more interesting.
[227:58.70]I can't believe it.
[228:01.06]Okay.
[228:04.32]I guess... I guess that makes sense, huh?
[228:11.24]Tongue-tied is broken down.
[228:13.02]Well, it'll be fine.
[228:17.26]Ugh.
[228:19.70]Traffic cats is one of the most inspirational, fun, fearful, exciting rides I have in the whole park.
[228:27.55]Let's look at how exciting these are.
[228:28.85]Let's see.
[228:29.31]This guy has to go to the bathroom really badly.
[228:37.63]Hope you can hold it.
[228:40.86]Hope you can hold your piss.
[228:42.16]Cause you're gonna piss your pants.
[228:49.49]I hope it goes all the way to the bottom.
[228:51.67]Put in 10 more cars?
[228:52.71]I can't.
[228:53.51]This is the maximum I can put on.
[228:54.83]Let's put his hands up.
[229:04.33]Watch when they put their hands in the air.
[229:07.31]Why are they acting like they're on a ride?
[229:08.81]Yeah!
[229:11.59]That was fun!
[229:26.40]You just bump into the next person.
[229:32.28]Uh-huh.
[229:36.62]Fantastic.
[229:40.57]People are just lining up now to get on this.
[229:44.99]Well, that was fun.
[229:46.01]Hope they're enjoying it.
[229:49.81]I'm going to laugh my ass off if this dude just shits his pants.
[229:56.11]Please, just like piss on the ride.
[229:57.77]Please, can they do that?
[230:00.51]Please tell me this guy can piss in the fucking stall here on the ride.
[230:04.66]Ugh.
[230:06.14]If only.
[230:08.54]If only.
[230:11.60]Alright, we're going good so far.
[230:14.30]Tongue tie's been fixed.
[230:15.28]Very good.
[230:18.32]Good value bumper car.
[230:19.40]Yeah, it's pretty good value.
[230:20.86]It's only $1.50.
[230:24.33]Where's my dinosaur?
[230:25.35]Okay, they're both of them.
[230:31.33]This is just annoying.
[230:33.05]People actually have to stand there.
[230:34.51]There's a lot of vomit in the park?
[230:40.48]What do you mean there's a lot of vomit in the park?
[230:42.32]Where?
[230:42.60]I don't see any vomit.
[230:45.20]I see a lot of trash.
[230:47.18]Where's their vomit?
[230:50.18]What the hell are you talking about?
[230:55.37]That's just a wasted cheeseburger thing.
[230:58.96]I don't see any puke.
[231:00.92]At all.
[231:03.04]Can you guys... I'm going to play spot the puke.
[231:05.64]I don't see it.
[231:07.70]Nope, just trash.
[231:13.76]Ah, ah, there it is.
[231:15.88]Sorry, he's going to push a dry broom all over it.
[231:17.94]It'll be fine.
[231:20.62]Nope, a bunch of people stepped in it and it went away.
[231:23.75]Look, people are cleaning it themselves.
[231:29.84]Spot the pew.
[231:32.06]Well, let's check in on our guys that got on the ride first.
[231:34.14]They're still in it.
[231:34.70]Mm-hmm.
[231:40.82]Having a great time.
[231:44.88]Enjoying ourselves.
[231:46.20]Good.
[231:48.62]What a value.
[231:49.19]I don't even see what the hell this thing was.
[231:53.01]There are plenty of bins.
[231:53.95]What are you even talking about?
[231:55.15]I need more bins.
[232:02.68]That is bullshit.
[232:05.66]I don't have any lights.
[232:06.33]I gotta put some lights here.
[232:07.23]I'm gonna string it together this way.
[232:15.85]Lame, you are a wuss who's broken down.
[232:17.61]Great.
[232:28.86]No, go up.
[232:43.65]Cool, alright.
[232:44.25]I'm gonna do this side.
[232:45.17]When it gets dark, I wanna make sure people can see.
[232:47.33]I'm gonna try... What if I just put these everywhere?
[233:09.39]No, that's not... Don't do that.
[233:11.39]That's going to hurt my eyes.
[233:14.61]That guy's been on the... Yeah, these people have been on this ride for an entire day.
[233:21.45]And they're having just as much fun as they had yesterday.
[233:26.74]This guy still has to pee.
[233:32.18]I want to see the reaction when they get off.
[233:34.44]It's very important to me.
[233:39.88]Just another few seconds.
[233:42.82]It might actually have been two days.
[233:47.61]On the kitty road.
[233:48.39]This is almost full of people.
[233:52.31]We almost have a full ride.
[233:55.49]Let's get the consensus on how was kitty traffic.
[234:00.18]Come on.
[234:00.78]Come on, Kristen.
[234:02.48]Let me know how it was.
[234:06.50]One more slot.
[234:09.02]48 hours of pure excitement.
[234:10.34]And... No, not yet.
[234:20.85]I love how he's still having that much fun.
[234:25.09]Alright.
[234:25.35]After two days, how did you enjoy it?
[234:29.61]Did you have fun?
[234:34.00]Yeah?
[234:37.65]I need to go to the bathroom after Cosmic Cow Milk.
[234:40.13]Not only did she have to go to the bathroom, she has diarrhea.
[234:42.38]Because of, like, the milkshake.
[234:46.64]That milkshake is two days old.
[234:49.04]And she's still drinking it.
[234:51.48]That looks awful.
[234:54.58]What looks awful?
[235:00.13]I don't know.
[235:01.89]What is she looking at?
[235:02.53]The ride?
[235:02.95]The ride?
[235:06.87]Better throw that in the trash.
[235:18.45]Keep stopping at the stalls.
[235:22.39]This lady's had to go pee for two days.
[235:26.17]She hasn't been able to.
[235:28.21]No, she's fine.
[235:29.51]She's fine.
[235:29.85]She peed her pants.
[235:30.59]She pissed in her pants.
[235:35.79]No, I don't know.
[235:38.31]Apparently she got over it.
[235:40.99]She definitely shit her pants.
[235:46.11]This is, I'm so curious about what is going to happen.
[235:48.11]No, no, no, shit, I have to pee again.
[235:52.17]What do her friends have to think about this?
[235:56.88]Are they making their way to the bathroom?
[235:58.50]They have to be, right?
[236:02.72]She's looking for the bathroom.
[236:07.04]Well, the bathroom's the other way.
[236:11.28]You are not going the right way.
[236:13.02]Oh, yes, you are.
[236:14.34]Hurry up and get there, quick.
[236:19.16]I hope she pees right in front of these kids.
[236:22.39]I'll follow this girl all the way.
[236:27.05]It's gonna get real loud.
[236:41.44]No, she had to go she actually went to bullshit No, it was worth watching raise the bathroom price We're throwing trash in my clean-ass park
[236:59.68]I need, um... What else do I need?
[237:04.48]Buildings.
[237:09.08]I want to annoy the fuck out of these people.
[237:13.38]What's the easiest way to make all these people even more upset that they're on this ride?
[237:17.41]Scenery.
[237:19.81]No.
[237:20.89]Statues and centerpieces.
[237:23.53]The toilet.
[237:23.85]We're going to put a bunch of toilet seats.
[237:26.21]No, these are clams.
[237:26.85]Clams.
[237:32.03]Just put really loud speakers.
[237:33.29]A gun.
[237:36.19]Does it, does it shoot?
[237:40.95]Stay on this ride.
[237:48.29]Oh yeah, by the way, when you get to the very end of the ride, you get shot with a gun.
[237:56.28]That's, that is terrible.
[237:58.26]That is terrible.
[238:00.28]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[238:05.16]Go back.
[238:10.72]Thank you for riding the ride.

[238:14.81]Enjoy the fucking ride.
[238:36.40]Alright, where's the, uh... I need, like, a shooting thing.
[238:44.34]Animatronics.
[238:47.71]Wait, what if I just shoot a cannon?
[238:53.39]No.
[238:56.27]Is this a dragon?
[238:59.55]No, I don't want that.
[239:02.53]Where is it?
[239:02.89]Special effects?
[239:03.55]Okay.
[239:06.79]Electric rod.
[239:07.63]No.
[239:07.69]I'm going to zap some people.
[239:14.49]Where is it?
[239:15.69]Fountain splash.
[239:17.49]Engine thruster.
[239:20.90]Explosion.
[239:21.56]No, that's too much.
[239:24.66]Steam jet?
[239:25.42]No.
[239:27.68]Oh, he found the dragons.
[239:29.06]I mean, this kind of looks like it, right?
[239:39.47]Let's get this in the right spot.
[239:57.03]Why do I think this is fucking funny?
[240:02.95]This is like horrible!
[240:05.45]You're on the right for two days and then you get SHOT!
[240:15.31]This is not even cool.
[240:16.67]This is dumb.
[240:18.33]I'm just gonna delete this.
[240:19.15]This sucks.
[240:23.24]No.
[240:23.56]I need to have like the explosion one.
[240:24.82]I thought that was gonna be cool.
[240:29.76]Not even close to being cool.
[240:34.13]Alright, what if I just shoot the flamethrower out?
[240:39.11]I'm shooting a flamethrower.
[240:44.53]Okay, and then we make it... Rotate it.
[240:55.78]That doesn't seem to be doing anything.
[240:57.06]That doesn't... Nobody's... Everything's... Everyone's fine.
[241:04.40]How would you stay alive from this?
[241:08.37]Then no one could survive that.
[241:09.41]These people are being roasted right now.
[241:14.80]Come on.
[241:16.42]What is up with this?
[241:21.93]Set the world on fire?
[241:26.35]Steam boiling Sparks?
[241:30.93]No.
[241:32.65]Easily the best ride in the park.
[241:37.91]No.
[241:40.03]Green laser.
[241:41.01]Shut up.
[241:43.89]Oh, well.
[241:45.91]Uh, that was dumb.
[241:47.98]Dumb.
[241:48.92]Delete it.
[241:54.89]Delete.
[242:18.24]At least they got their money.
[242:25.44]I'm going to go over here now.
[242:35.82]I fucking knew that was going to happen.
[242:38.26]I even accidentally did it and then I got even more confident that I was not going to be able... You know what I'm saying.
[242:44.32]I did it by accident and I figured, oh, fuck, I'm going to do that.
[242:46.80]And then I did it again because I'm a fucking idiot.
[242:50.42]But, whatever.
[242:51.32]Let's make another ride.
[242:54.92]Two pancakes.
[242:56.50]We're good.
[242:57.60]Cracking.
[242:59.00]Let's move over this way.

[243:58.31]Hold on.
[244:01.86]alright you're trying to tell me that this ride which is a default blueprint is not as less intense than the one that I made before you gotta be kidding me that's bullshit log flume here we go I want to log flume over here like in this area
[244:30.58]I want to splash everybody.
[244:31.72]It's going to be fun.
[244:39.14]Hmm.
[244:39.78]Maybe not over there.
[244:40.46]Hmm.
[244:45.70]We can just go over that.
[244:46.60]We'll try to just go over it.
[244:48.73]Alright.
[244:49.81]Conveyor belt.
[244:50.31]Yep.
[244:50.81]Yep.
[244:59.86]Can I make this steeper?
[245:05.00]Now I'm going to make it turn a little.
[245:07.38]What does this do?
[245:10.43]Can vary about lift hill end.
[245:12.03]Oh, lift hill end.
[245:12.89]Let's go a little higher.
[245:17.23]Let's make it at least as high as this thing.
[245:29.96]No, what?
[245:30.60]And then you have to walk down.
[245:46.01]Wow, what a shit ride.
[245:47.41]Wow, that was not worth waiting for.
[245:49.37]Now we have to walk down.
[245:54.31]Just a bent spoon.
[245:55.52]No, that can't be what I do.
[246:03.35]I wanna make it do something cool.
[246:04.67]Alright.
[246:09.93]Start the... No.
[246:10.75]Start the drop here.
[246:11.47]Okay.

[246:24.51]Okay.
[246:24.67]Okay.
[246:32.99]And then we need the, you know, splash section.
[246:39.37]No, fuck, it's gonna go lower.
[246:44.38]Oh, you motherfucker.
[246:48.20]No, go down.
[246:49.10]I don't even care.
[247:00.55]Uh, wait just a second here.
[247:05.55]It's gonna scare everybody.
[247:07.07]It's gonna be great.
[247:07.71]Watch this.
[247:10.79]People are gonna be like, we're going down into the tunnel!
[247:13.15]And then they don't.
[247:13.76]Alright, um... Just dump him down there.
[247:33.19]Just drop him into the fucking cave.
[247:42.11]Just paint over it.
[247:47.69]And then over here.
[247:53.31]They come back up.
[248:09.26]I can do an auto-tunnel?
[248:10.10]How do I do auto-tunnel?
[248:16.16]Dude, in here, this is gonna be sick.
[248:22.62]Now, how do I, like, get down there?
[248:23.78]I wanna put, like, lights in here.
[248:37.55]The auto-tunnel button?
[248:42.88]Is that in here?
[248:44.99]Rough and smooth.
[248:45.99]Chisel.
[248:46.55]Pull.
[248:47.79]Flatten the surface.
[248:48.45]Flatten the foundation.
[248:50.68]Scenery lock?
[248:56.98]Eh, whatever.
[249:01.56]What kind of casual, automatically tunnels?
[249:03.72]I know!
[249:06.08]We're making our own tunnel.
[249:07.16]It's gonna be so crazy.
[249:08.14]There's gonna be lights in here.
[249:09.14]It's gonna be scary.
[249:12.73]Click the ride, edit the ride, check auto tunnel build ride.
[249:16.65]Are you serious?
[249:22.02]Click the ride, edit the ride, click auto tunnel.
[249:32.90]Okay, auto tunnel.
[249:39.93]Ooh!
[249:42.31]Oooooh!
[249:49.99]Oh, Jesus.
[249:50.89]This is a little... Get out!
[250:07.80]Okay, hold on.
[250:08.90]Wait, wait, wait.
[250:09.90]I need... Now I just need a standards track.
[250:14.14]To go up.
[250:20.59]Okay, hold on.
[250:25.17]Wait.
[250:25.87]Wait.
[250:27.69]Alright.
[250:28.53]Then we end.
[250:29.15]The splashdown ends here.
[250:30.33]And thank you for coming.
[250:38.03]Fuck, rented real estate.
[250:51.82]One more.
[250:54.24]Down.
[250:57.38]Start to splash down.
[250:58.32]That works.
[251:01.08]Okay.
[251:02.70]Splash down.
[251:03.26]End.
[251:03.46]Oh, you shithead.
[251:12.84]Come on.
[251:14.68]What is the deal here?
[251:18.10]Just get to the point.
[251:18.78]Okay, right here.
[251:21.79]Perfect.
[251:28.53]Went a little too far.
[251:30.83]Just a bit too far.
[251:35.48]Oh, fuck.
[251:48.24]Uh...
[251:50.73]What are you doing, man?
[251:58.48]Can I go underneath this shit?
[252:07.37]Why can I not auto-complete?
[252:10.17]It's supposed to save me in situations like this.
[252:18.42]I wanna go up.
[252:20.25]Oh, fine.
[252:20.67]Just go over it like this.
[252:23.41]There's one more splash at the very end.
[252:26.19]That's how we're gonna do it.
[252:26.95]That's how we're gonna justify it.
[252:36.45]Jesus Christ!
[252:38.59]Jesus!
[252:43.77]Oh, God!
[252:46.16]This went really wrong.
[252:48.54]I can't move the track, that's the problem.
[252:51.44]I wanna move this shit.
[253:00.50]There, finally.
[253:01.22]God.
[253:06.66]Alright, start to splash down back here.
[253:10.26]Splash down, you get one more splash.
[253:16.57]And the splash is gonna end.
[253:27.53]What is the problem?
[253:29.49]Why can't you do this?
[253:33.76]Oh my fucking god, who cares about the drop, just go.
[253:36.54]Just like, get it down there.
[253:41.02]Delete the game.
[253:46.70]Did I run on a track?
[253:48.90]I might have ran on a track.
[253:57.49]That might be the actual problem here.
[253:59.47]Let's see.
[254:01.45]No.
[254:01.79]Okay.
[254:02.17]We're good.
[254:03.94]Almost there, boys and girls.
[254:06.86]We've almost made it.
[254:11.68]Getting very close.
[254:12.52]I can't autocomplete this ride.
[254:16.14]For some reason it won't let me.
[254:24.60]No, we gotta go a little bit further out.
[254:25.71]What?
[254:46.72]What the hell is this talking about?
[254:47.70]Like, but I can't go over that?
[254:53.33]Auto tunnel isn't even on anymore.
[255:18.13]It's too close to the ground.
[255:19.43]Oh, that's not good to know.
[255:22.36]Shit, really?
[255:29.58]Come on.
[255:34.16]So can I, like, raise this shit up?
[255:41.17]Ending log fooms is stupid, buggy, and precise.
[255:43.29]Really?
[255:45.99]I can't just do that?
[255:50.73]That's really weird.
[255:51.57]Well, I'm gonna have to move this forward then.
[256:01.21]Let's just go down here.
[256:02.65]Is that gonna do it?
[256:13.04]Okay, that does it.
[256:15.12]I need a station now.
[256:20.96]Uh, entry on the... Which one do I want?
[256:24.62]Entry, right, exit, left.
[256:25.96]Entry, right, exit, right.
[256:28.28]This one, right?
[256:31.52]No.
[256:35.12]Entry, left, exit, left.
[256:37.03]Is it that one?
[256:39.43]I don't even know which one it is.
[256:40.29]I don't even know what the fuck I'm looking at here.
[256:42.65]I think it's this one.
[256:46.21]Whatever, we'll find out.
[256:48.01]Nope.
[256:49.37]It's the other one.
[256:55.60]Alright, another station or two.
[256:57.97]And connect.
[257:03.51]Back it up.
[257:05.15]Delete this.
[257:07.25]Connect it.
[257:08.61]Come on.
[257:10.14]You can do it.
[257:11.64]I'm certain you can.
[257:26.06]Oh, you motherfucker.
[257:27.16]What the hell are you doing?
[257:30.20]What is... What are you... What?
[257:35.44]Please connect to each other.
[257:36.82]This is fucking stupid.
[257:42.19]I just... I just wanna... I just wanna connect you.
[257:48.05]Dear God.
[257:49.77]Okay.
[257:50.59]Got it.
[257:53.31]Done.
[257:55.26]Now we're going to test the ride.
[257:58.52]Smooth it all out.
[257:59.96]Smooth it.
[258:02.11]We're ready to do it.
[258:03.03]Start the test.
[258:04.77]Let's get in there and ride it.
[258:09.73]Can I not ride the ride?
[258:13.35]Can I ride it while looking at editing mode?
[258:17.98]I cannot ride it while I'm editing it.
[258:20.44]Seems a little weird.
[258:23.38]Well,
[258:25.98]Okay.
[258:28.30]Let's just get in it.
[258:31.40]Go, go, go.
[258:33.23]Now, all it needs is a way to get in.
[258:34.53]That's true.
[258:36.47]Let's see what this does.
[258:37.33]I can put some lights in here.
[258:45.98]There we go.
[258:46.80]We're on the ride.
[258:48.60]It's a big water ride.
[258:51.00]Oh, Jesus.
[258:52.22]We're going straight in.
[258:59.18]Wow, that was fun.
[259:00.90]We need lights.
[259:01.52]Oh no, I think we're stuck.
[259:10.97]I need like a boogeyman to scream.
[259:17.03]I can't wait to put like a bunch of weird shit right here.
[259:18.97]Alright, now we gotta boost it.
[259:24.46]Alright, it works.
[259:31.14]Pretty exciting.
[259:32.54]I'm seeing a lot of excitement.
[259:36.16]Alright.
[259:38.18]How do I get into the tunnel?
[259:44.65]Is there enough for me to shine a big light in there?
[259:46.47]Are they going to think they died in this tunnel?
[259:50.93]I know, right?
[259:53.49]Scenery.
[259:56.19]Pyrotechnics.
[259:59.40]Explosions and shit everywhere.
[260:04.36]Flamethrower.
[260:05.76]Yep.
[260:06.46]Definitely going to have a couple of these.
[260:09.98]It's like aiming right at you.
[260:11.14]And you're like, what the fuck is that?
[260:21.81]At least now I can start to see.
[260:23.09]Hold on.
[260:23.49]They're going to add flamethrowers the whole way down.
[260:25.85]Oh, there it is.
[260:31.27]There's the track.
[260:31.80]Okay, hold on.
[260:35.69]Hold on.
[260:44.96]Oh, we're really into it here.
[260:46.54]We're into the thick of it.
[260:50.68]Destructed.
[260:59.37]Look at this.
[260:59.95]This is going to be amazing.
[261:07.31]I'm going to turn off the terrain, right?
[261:14.98]What the fuck was that?
[261:17.82]Did you guys hear that explosion?
[261:23.78]Into the tunnel we go.
[261:25.44]Put a Criken in the tunnel?
[261:26.50]That's a good idea.
[261:27.14]I think I'm actually going to do that.
[261:30.15]Like right here.
[261:30.89]It's going to be like about to bite you.
[261:40.06]alright so right here the Criken is right there no I gotta cover that up right here alright where's the Criken well like no a dragon a dragon a dragon definitely dragon no Criken we need like the sleeping no this one no
[262:08.83]No, this thing's just... What a piece of shit.
[262:10.39]Is that a fire-breathing dragon?
[262:11.59]It's like a stupid bronchitisaurus.
[262:15.43]Just eats leaves.
[262:16.99]That's dumb.
[262:17.45]What about this head cowboy?
[262:18.53]No.
[262:19.83]Fine.
[262:28.86]I can't put him, like, right there.
[262:30.88]Hold on, I can put him, like, here.
[262:31.98]Oops.
[262:33.28]Hold on, hold on.
[262:42.00]A knight?
[262:44.18]Jester knight?
[262:47.42]Pirate band?
[262:49.00]Sleeping drat?
[262:53.19]I thought this was a coiled up ship.
[263:01.37]A witch casting spells?
[263:02.61]Yeah, there's gonna be like a witch down here.
[263:15.50]I can't even see that shit.
[263:18.20]Uh... No.
[263:21.52]One of the dragons has to be here.
[263:22.91]Right here.
[263:30.05]Okay, right.
[263:38.93]Get in there.
[263:43.76]Get in there!
[263:49.82]I want his head right there.
[263:52.54]Alright, there he is.
[263:53.18]This is going to be... We need some more lights here.
[264:00.17]No, that light is dumb.
[264:03.67]Box light.
[264:07.47]I think those things are dumb.
[264:11.37]Oil lamp.
[264:14.23]You can't even see the dragon.
[264:19.66]It has some street lights.
[264:33.35]How do you turn these on?
[264:39.99]Okay.
[264:42.64]And then one more special effect.
[264:51.41]Let's ride it.
[264:53.75]You ready to ride it?
[264:58.19]Here we go.
[265:03.38]We're getting.
[265:05.58]Here we go.
[265:06.34]Oh, this is the end of the ride.
[265:11.02]That's okay.
[265:16.15]We can wait.
[265:18.07]No, wait, wait, wait.
[265:19.87]Place an entrance.
[265:22.63]I gotta patch that up.
[265:25.79]It's a little screwed up right now.
[265:27.03]It's okay.
[265:27.49]Uh, here's the entrance.
[265:34.77]Oh, fuck.
[265:35.05]I have to open that ride again.
[265:36.00]I think straight down will be good.
[265:41.62]Exit can just go right here.
[265:42.94]Who cares?
[265:51.13]And the exit...
[265:55.45]I'm going to have to delete this guy.
[266:01.55]How do I delete him?
[266:02.43]Get rid of this stupid pancake.
[266:08.83]They don't eat the pancakes anymore.
[266:10.71]They were a staple for a while, but who cares?
[266:16.16]Ready for business.
[266:18.54]Just got to test it, and then I can open it.
[266:20.80]Let's ride it and see how cool our ride is.
[266:26.11]Here we go.
[266:27.37]Speed it up!
[266:32.81]You can never eliminate chef- sheef beef?
[266:37.67]It's running nice for a 780.
[266:38.61]Alright, this is what we did it for.
[266:40.55]This is what we came for.
[266:41.37]This is gonna be scary.
[266:44.63]We're going into the tunnel.
[266:46.63]There goes the first splash.
[266:49.69]Oh, you can see the fire!
[266:55.15]Wait, what is that?
[266:57.90]Is that a dragon?
[266:59.42]Holy shit, a dragon!
[267:02.80]Whoa!
[267:05.14]Dude, this is better than fucking Disney World!
[267:09.47]Whoa!
[267:10.79]Mom!
[267:12.49]Mom, did you see that?
[267:13.61]He's making noise, too.
[267:21.81]Perfect ride.
[267:29.73]Alright, now we sit here for a little bit.
[267:32.62]Now we sit here.
[267:35.80]Now we gotta go across the whole park.
[267:41.44]This sucks.
[267:44.80]What is that?
[267:46.92]Did he get up?
[267:49.43]There's another dragon.
[267:50.51]Oh, wait a minute.
[267:54.33]Hold on.
[267:56.88]Open for business.
[267:58.42]Open this for sure, because it's safe and people liked it and it was a 4 out of 10.
[268:02.99]We could really do some scenery work here, guys.
[268:05.81]That gave me an idea.
[268:11.55]On the way back, you get to see... I don't know.
[268:21.92]Some more animatronics.
[268:26.36]Where are the animatronics?
[268:29.02]Right here.
[268:30.48]Okay, you know Small World?
[268:31.64]Like, it's a small world.
[268:39.31]How do I make these guys bigger?
[268:41.87]Is there a way for me to scale this guy up?
[268:47.50]So he's, like, actually huge?
[268:51.88]What's, like, the scale person button?
[269:02.76]Two miles of gentle movement.
[269:05.40]Because I could do a bunch of cool stuff here.
[269:06.78]There's this one.
[269:25.08]It's like they come down and try to eat you.
[269:34.62]Don't get hit by the fucking scanner, too!
[269:42.58]This is perfect!
[269:44.18]No, shit.
[269:44.76]Not perfect.
[269:45.20]It needs to be the other way.
[269:50.42]This... Oh, shit.
[270:09.64]See?
[270:10.04]There's one.
[270:10.48]People are going to be like, oh mom, we're going through the laser!
[270:15.09]Perfect.
[270:18.59]Okay, um... Somebody died.
[270:22.37]Oh no, that doesn't say died.
[270:24.15]No, they're fine.
[270:25.31]People are fine.
[270:29.08]Launch doors?
[270:30.74]Uh, yeah.
[270:31.14]They're going to come up through the launch doors.
[270:39.43]It's like a mission complete, cadets.
[270:48.32]You have done it.
[270:48.92]Oops.
[270:52.14]Oops.
[270:59.87]Excellent work, cadets.
[271:02.29]And they can be like on a space adventure and they can be wicked excited about it.
[271:06.07]Well, what are you thinking?
[271:07.49]Easy.
[271:22.28]Perfect.
[271:24.66]See, they won't even know.
[271:25.38]What they see is this.
[271:39.81]Remember I told you your little brother got a hold of it?
[271:55.89]Oh, man.
[272:00.08]And there's gold.
[272:01.74]Don't forget about the gold in those hills up there.
[272:03.96]I think I'm done.
[272:17.62]Hold on.
[272:17.94]I've got to chill out for a second.
[272:24.50]Spinning kisser.
[272:27.91]At least it'll be interesting to look at, right?
[272:31.57]No, I don't want to make two of these fucking things.
[272:35.91]Alright, let's see how people like it.
[272:48.32]All my scenery is done.
[272:50.48]Are people waiting in line right now?
[272:53.02]Shit, this is too long.
[272:55.34]I need to add more carts.
[272:58.53]Ride's closed.
[273:05.13]It takes so long for this to happen that 20 cars is okay, I think.
[273:09.99]No, like 15.
[273:12.67]Yeah.
[273:13.25]Like, it takes so long to do this that we can keep low.
[273:15.17]It'll be a consistent cycle.
[273:17.59]Over and over again.
[273:22.27]Jesus, that's not good.
[273:26.45]Tongue-tied has been fixed.
[273:29.91]I need more paths.
[273:31.27]Alright, let's go this way with the path.
[273:34.64]How am I doing with money?
[273:35.56]Where's my money?
[273:37.08]Park management?
[273:37.64]Am I in the blue?
[273:38.50]Am I in the red?
[273:40.62]Finance.
[273:42.46]Okay.
[273:44.66]Cash flow.
[273:46.51]Rides and tickets.
[273:47.23]Shops and facilities.
[273:50.51]Who's taking this much money?
[273:51.57]Staff wages.
[273:52.33]Staff wages.
[274:06.96]You're fired.
[274:09.34]You're fired.
[274:16.04]You are also fired.
[274:20.85]Don't like working here?
[274:22.15]You get fired.
[274:24.23]It's just how it works, guys.
[274:27.17]Alright, what else we got?
[274:31.17]We got tongue tied, broke down.
[274:33.73]It's okay, it got fixed.
[274:37.64]That was the pancake guy.
[274:43.67]Did I fire the first employee I ever had?
[274:46.39]Alright, now we took down our staff.
[274:50.35]Okay, staff finances.
[274:52.35]Staff wages are still so much money.
[274:54.11]Where's it coming from?
[274:57.06]Vendors.
[274:58.90]Oh, shit.
[274:59.58]It's these people.
[275:01.18]These vendors are the ones causing problems.
[275:05.98]Yeah, get this guy.
[275:06.82]Get this... You're fired too.
[275:09.74]You dumb bathroom joke.
[275:11.30]That doesn't even fucking make sense anymore.
[275:13.46]Okay, um... Marketing.
[275:17.50]Get this out of here.
[275:18.20]No more marketing campaigns.
[275:23.14]Guests.
[275:23.92]How do I get more money from the guests?
[275:26.18]Is there a way I can turn them up?
[275:27.48]This litter is disgusting.
[275:29.96]Ew, I stepped in sick.
[275:31.88]How am I supposed to run a fucking park here when there's too many people that need money?
[275:39.11]Profit, 800.
[275:40.15]Construction costs.
[275:42.57]Cash flow.
[275:46.21]I'm gonna need $12,000 in the hole.
[275:48.73]Shut it down.
[275:50.97]Shut it down.
[275:57.27]Shut the whole thing down.
[276:00.30]Look at... No one's even riding this ride.
[276:04.04]Shut it down.
[276:04.80]Unbelievable.
[276:05.40]I'm losing money there.
[276:07.77]It's time to start costing four dollars.
[276:09.99]If you don't like it, fucking leave.
[276:14.61]You don't want to spend more than that much.
[276:16.01]If you don't like it, there's the door.
[276:18.53]Park is bleeding money right now.
[276:20.81]Three bucks, everything's at least five dollars.
[276:22.55]There's a lot of litter in the park.
[276:26.75]Well, maybe if you spent more money on shit.
[276:29.55]The Dark Souls graveyard is going to be three bucks.
[276:34.21]Yeah, you're all still in line.
[276:35.19]Of course you are.
[276:38.18]Uh, what about making this seven bucks?
[276:41.56]Yeah, you're all still in line.
[276:42.50]What about this?
[276:46.06]Two bucks?
[276:46.72]What a fucking ripoff.
[276:48.78]This should be seven.
[276:52.72]I'm gonna triple my profits.
[276:55.77]Four, that's good.
[276:56.51]I guess that's what I get.
[277:01.11]Log flume needs to be, like, at least six.
[277:07.86]Look at how much fun these people just had.
[277:08.98]I didn't even get to ride my new creation either.
[277:15.90]That's bullshit.
[277:18.50]How much is the hot dogs and hamburgers people have to eat, right?
[277:21.28]Well, let's force them to have to eat expensive shit.
[277:26.59]Profit.
[277:28.73]Negative, huh?
[277:29.87]Okay.
[277:31.75]Well, that's easy to fix.
[277:39.43]You have to eat.
[277:39.95]You're not gonna go hungry.
[277:42.25]I'm not even doing, like, the correct management.
[277:51.10]$13 hamburger at Disney.
[277:52.34]This thing could cost money, too.
[277:54.22]Every time it activates, it should ask for money.
[278:01.66]Is this inconsistent?
[278:02.48]Can you go to the different part of the park and buy it for cheaper?
[278:06.74]Alright, I gotta make sure of that, because this... Yeah, okay.
[278:10.91]Six, six, six.
[278:12.73]I'm the fucking devil.
[278:16.37]Should I get this game?
[278:17.16]Did you like Rollercoaster Tycoon?
[278:24.22]I need another janitor.
[278:25.46]There's a lot of litter.
[278:26.34]Yeah, well, I can't really deal with that right now.
[278:30.88]I want to ride this ride for the last time.
[278:34.63]Why is nobody on this?
[278:44.90]Too expensive now, apparently.
[278:48.06]Can't be eight bucks.
[278:51.36]Oh no, the thing didn't come back.
[278:53.22]Shit, is it still online?
[278:55.36]I think it is.
[278:59.55]It's not even open.
[279:01.63]It didn't even come back yet.
[279:11.77]I guess it can be 8 or 7 because I don't even know if they'll pay it.
[279:18.58]God, that's... What time is it?
[279:23.20]I might... Yeah, I'm going to be calling it a night here in like 10 or 15 minutes.
[279:30.94]This was fun though.
[279:31.56]I'm like actually as stupid and shitty as this all has been.
[279:36.25]I've actually been enjoying myself.
[279:41.47]Ooh, I like the kitty carts.
[279:43.43]They light up at night.
[279:46.55]I mean, I've been just fucking around this whole time.
[279:49.77]But... Actually taking this seriously.
[279:53.56]I beat Dark Souls 3, you know.
[279:58.24]Can I open this fucking ride yet?
[279:59.30]Alright, I'm only losing $400 this month, not like $10,000.
[280:10.00]I need something over here.
[280:10.88]I need you to, like, have to go all the way out here to ride, like, to eat, like, a hamburger.
[280:18.80]Alright, it's ready.
[280:19.64]Open for business.
[280:21.60]I'm gonna ride it with all you guys.
[280:23.26]This is how we'll end the stream.
[280:24.95]We're gonna ride the log flume.
[280:26.97]Together.
[280:29.27]So here you guys come.
[280:31.19]Oh, here comes Ronnie!
[280:33.07]Oh, there's Ronnie!
[280:36.29]Oh, there's Aeronorth.
[280:38.48]There's Hypo.
[280:39.24]There's Hypo.
[280:40.74]Leather Jacket.
[280:41.30]These are my mods.
[280:46.68]Oh, wait.
[280:46.96]Is that CS Go Home?
[280:51.40]Holy shit, it is.
[280:52.50]There's Hunter's Hunter.
[280:55.12]Will Sarcasm's right there.
[280:57.84]Leftward Elk.
[280:58.94]Dazzarth.
[280:59.46]There they are.
[281:00.26]Dean Ziggs.
[281:01.17]There's Dean Ziggs.
[281:04.84]The real Mr. Zombie Jesus, that's you!
[281:08.08]Oh, no, this is you.
[281:09.18]This is us.
[281:13.56]Who's behind me?
[281:15.36]Who's in, like, the car behind me?
[281:16.24]I need to see.
[281:18.60]Oh, there I am.
[281:19.62]It's Little Brother.
[281:20.50]It's Little Brother Jeremy.
[281:22.52]Do you like my theme park I made, Mummy?
[281:25.92]Oh, look, there he is.
[281:26.62]There's, uh... Oh, there's my best hat!
[281:31.10]Then Mr. Duck plays...
[281:34.05]And then a super hot soup.
[281:35.99]And who's the last one?
[281:37.79]Oh, J-Buddy!
[281:41.39]And there's me!
[281:42.89]Little dinner brother Timmy.
[281:45.39]It's me.
[281:46.43]I'm ready to go on the ride.
[281:47.59]This is so much fun.
[281:53.33]It's gonna be super crazy.
[281:54.83]It's gonna be fun.
[281:57.14]Is he just reading names from the chat?
[281:58.96]Uh, yeah.
[282:00.06]Here we go.
[282:00.66]Guys, put your hands up.
[282:03.59]This is the part where the dragon comes.
[282:05.58]Watch out for the dragon!
[282:07.92]Wow!
[282:11.38]This is the part where the door- Oh, watch out for the fucking Han Solo doors!
[282:16.74]And the dragon!
[282:18.00]And the street lights!
[282:19.66]Remember those?
[282:20.20]Here he comes.
[282:28.44]I can't see.
[282:28.92]I'm too tiny.
[282:29.73]I'm too small.
[282:32.41]Oh, yay!
[282:33.07]Here comes the Han Solo doors!
[282:38.51]Oh, my best hat, you died.
[282:40.88]You just got clipped.
[282:44.72]Well, what else is on this ride that I can't see?
[282:47.32]There's trees over there.
[282:54.76]But don't forget about, here come the two dragons, the twin dragons.
[282:59.19]You can see in the distance the park.
[283:02.27]Okay, I can't fucking see over this dumb little shit's head, so we're gonna go this way.
[283:09.10]See?
[283:09.54]Remember when we went through those?
[283:10.78]Whoa.
[283:19.44]You can almost see the whole park from here.
[283:23.13]Hope you guys don't have any metal on you.
[283:27.59]Two emerald nightmare dragons.
[283:29.03]That's when they come, they go, brrrah.
[283:33.78]These things suck.
[283:37.32]Can you at least make them do something?
[283:40.12]They do the same thing as the other dragon, is that they're lame.
[283:43.55]Ooh, watch it!
[283:46.77]Ow!
[283:49.53]Oh, that was so much fun.
[283:50.33]Okay, go!
[284:02.83]That was fun.
[284:06.12]Did you guys have a good time riding that?
[284:12.38]Where are we?
[284:14.18]I had some fun.
[284:14.72]Are we still all the way back here?
[284:17.58]Yeah.
[284:19.38]Well, that was fun.
[284:21.55]We got a lot of laughs.
[284:25.69]I'm glad you guys enjoyed the ride.
[284:32.49]Whoops.
[284:33.31]Well, we no longer exist.
[284:38.07]Apparently.
[284:38.47]Alright.
[284:42.29]I was going for an explosion.
[284:43.37]I was going to try to blow us all up, but that didn't work, so let's just do it over here.
[284:48.26]Okay, this is us on this ride now.
[284:50.56]Remember this ride?
[284:57.40]How do I, like, move it?
[285:03.58]I was trying to, like, have it explode.
[285:06.77]And now I can't even do it.
[285:13.63]Oh, here we go.
[285:15.35]Uh... Remember this?
[285:17.37]Hey, remember this funny thing that happened?
[285:25.71]Oh my god, look at how funny that was.
[285:27.09]The princess is unkillable!
[285:29.51]I can't hurt the princess!
[285:34.44]Remember when he did that?
[285:44.79]Smooth it.
[285:45.81]Yeah, when you go to the... Yeah, that's too bad.
[285:49.49]Well, before I get going, thank you all for joining me.
[285:54.07]My general consensus on the game, if we're talking for real, is it actually seems really fun.
[286:00.22]It feels like there's a lot you could customize.
[286:01.90]If you really want to sit here for, like, hours and hours and hours, you can really make some pretty cool shit, I think.
[286:07.67]Somebody's drowning.
[286:08.29]No, they're just sitting in, like, ankle-deep water with their phones out.
[286:14.65]No, they have, like, slushies.
[286:20.39]Well, fuck these people.
[286:21.29]They're too dumb.
[286:23.72]I'd say I'd recommend it.
[286:25.48]If you're into the park kind of simulation thing, it's pretty fun.
[286:30.43]Just don't make a roller coaster like this.
[286:32.87]Because people will not like it.
[286:35.57]But yeah, hope you guys enjoyed the stream.
[286:37.26]Thanks for coming out.
[286:38.00]I'll talk to you guys.
[286:39.90]If I don't stream again this weekend, I was planning on maybe doing an off-schedule one.
[286:45.53]Thanks for being a moron for five hours.
[286:48.61]Well, the Wonder Zone is not necessarily complete.
[286:50.75]I might come back to it one day or I might do it again.
[286:52.85]Something else.
[286:55.03]But before I go, I want to say thanks to the subs that came in that I missed.
[286:59.30]Thanks to Katis Love for two months.
[287:02.00]Hihohee.

[287:18.58]Planning to stream any Karazhan with some friends.
[287:20.44]No, that was the worst stream I've ever done.
[287:23.90]That Karazhan stream was fucking terrible.
[287:27.53]And I apologize for anybody that had to witness that awful stream.
[287:31.21]Because it was just terrible.
[287:33.13]Yeah, happy Black Friday.
[287:35.59]If you bought it.
[287:36.07]Isn't Cyber Monday coming up here soon?
[287:38.67]Buy yourself some things on Amazon.
[287:41.65]Or Newegg or something.
[287:43.25]I know a lot of people have deals.
[287:45.19]Hey, DaMonkey2.
[287:45.99]DaMonkey2, thanks for the sub.
[287:48.63]Moving on here.
[287:51.04]OnionTheOccupolite.
[287:53.28]Thanks for nine months.
[287:53.98]I always screw up people's names, and I'm sorry.
[287:55.98]I'm the worst.
[287:57.14]But thanks a lot, Onion.

[288:20.26]Awesome Alec for two months.
[288:22.80]Just had the best six out of ten D- coaster ride of my life.
[288:25.72]Yeah.
[288:26.70]Everything here was a D- except for like this.
[288:28.38]Apparently this is like the best ride in the whole park.
[288:30.46]I don't know how or why.
[288:33.12]But thank you to James Orr's Squid Bones Snow...
[288:39.41]That always scares me.
[288:40.95]Snowman taters for seven months.
[288:42.37]I love donuts three for ten months.
[288:43.85]Thanks.
[288:44.58]All sham no wow.
[288:46.00]Two hours ago.
[288:46.78]Hopefully these people are still here.
[288:48.18]If not, then thanks, Mark.
[288:49.40]For nine months.
[288:49.90]Welcome to Burgerland.
[288:51.12]Now this is the Wonder Zone.
[288:53.80]Dingo bingo 420.
[288:55.72]Thanks.
[288:56.02]Hoggle boggle.
[288:57.66]Elroy leet.
[288:58.91]Thanks for two months.
[288:59.75]Bloodborne hype.
[289:01.21]I do want to play Bloodborne on stream.
[289:03.49]I'm not sure when that's going to happen, but that's one of my favorite games of all time, so might as well do it at some point.
[289:09.42]Boom, America, 10 months.
[289:10.88]Rich much?
[289:11.46]Not really.
[289:11.98]This park was bleeding money the entire time we were here, but who cares?
[289:14.22]It was sandbox mode.
[289:15.18]Who cares?
[289:16.12]But thanks for the 10 months, dude.
[289:18.42]Gmanland42, Sprigwar, DankMemeStealer, SirCurlyFry, a lot of subs tonight.
[289:26.82]You guys are... You guys are really supportive.
[289:31.88]Contempo135, TwitchyDove, SketchyDragon for 10 months, 9 months, and 2 months, respectively.
[289:36.34]Any chance we... Oh, yeah, I've already guessed.
[289:37.46]I saw you guys.
[289:37.92]I saw you dudes.
[289:39.93]I don't think I saw AceTech09, Balder92, TGMason05.
[289:43.79]Thanks.
[289:44.97]I believe that's everybody.
[289:48.80]How is that not considered spam?
[289:50.88]What were you talking about?
[289:53.50]Is Dark Souls 3 or Bloodborne better?
[289:54.84]I think Bloodborne's a better game than Dark Souls 3.
[289:57.34]But, well, on a technical spectrum, Dark Souls 3 on PC is much better because it runs at 60 FPS and doesn't have horrible loading times, which Bloodborne had the first couple months it was out.
[290:12.39]But, it's still a great game.
[290:16.93]I would order them Bloodborne than Dark Souls 3, but it's just a different play style.
[290:19.91]I just like the atmosphere.
[290:20.85]I've talked about that before, but
[290:23.11]Yeah, good night, guys.
[290:24.03]Thanks for coming out.
[290:24.85]Much love.
[290:25.43]I'll see you next time.
[290:26.71]If I don't see you this weekend, I'll see you on Tuesday.
[290:28.37]But I'm planning on doing an off stream because I missed on Thanksgiving.
[290:33.36]Good night, my pretties.
