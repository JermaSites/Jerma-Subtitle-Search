[00:00.95]American Family Insurance gives you... I don't know.
[00:04.47]I have no idea how their coverage is, but... I'm not gonna read that.
[00:13.44]Odd watchers skip 30 minutes.
[00:16.06]Why?
[00:16.30]Because I... Every time we start a VR stream, I... Cherish the fact that I'm not stuck in a virtual world for 20 minutes.
[00:24.06]I can exist out in my own space and hang out and see what you guys are really saying in real time.
[00:30.56]It's not 30 minutes, it's like 10.
[00:37.94]But you did that all day.
[00:39.12]Hey.
[00:41.78]You don't know what I did all day.
[00:43.92]For all you know, I could have been sitting on the toilet for an hour.
[00:46.39]How do you know?
[01:01.23]My did my make Jerma what did my make Jerma what?
[01:07.85]He's still on the toilet I Wish I could get away with that.
[01:11.30]There's no way I could though.
[01:12.82]You know it there's no way I could do a Accidental face cam the whole computers in the bathroom, and I'm sitting on the toilet I Mean I guess I could but it not the way that I want I
[01:33.70]Just like old times, yeah.
[01:41.78]We need the bird's eye view.
[01:43.69]Wait, the bird's eye view in the bathroom?
[01:48.69]Why would I have all that?
[01:52.11]Why would I go through the pain and suffering to set up like five cameras to do a look-at-me-I'm-on-the-toilet joke?
[02:05.95]Make it the next event.
[02:07.19]No, that's not the next event.
[02:10.26]Can I just drink my coffee for a second?
[02:13.92]Can't wait till he does that.
[02:14.90]Chat, I'm not gonna cut off a finger.
[02:16.28]Not one.
[02:16.94]Alright, I'll do one.
[02:17.96]I hate that fucking coffee pasta, but I love it at the same time.
[02:28.22]Just one finger.
[02:29.92]No, I'm not gonna do it.
[02:31.90]Alright, two?
[02:33.10]Two sounds good.
[02:37.44]I hate it.
[02:41.56]Look, Chubby Bunny is not going to happen before a VR stream or during a VR stream.
[02:46.69]Do you know how horrible that would be?
[02:50.43]Hey guys, I just got out of VR.
[02:51.87]I feel like shit.
[02:53.17]It's been like four hours.
[02:54.41]Let me stuff my mouth full of marshmallows until I throw up.
[02:58.22]No, that's going to happen on a gaming stream.
[03:08.36]Honka S. This is a gaming stream.
[03:13.34]I mean, it is, but it's me being put inside of the video game.
[03:18.64]Thought I cleared my throat with much more than this before I unmuted.
[03:21.93]Apparently not.
[03:29.13]Okay.
[03:30.07]See?
[03:30.71]I'm not old.
[03:31.87]I'm just like you.
[03:33.01]I'm in my early twenties.
[03:35.17]I'm young.
[03:39.85]Real voice.
[03:46.93]Just like me.
[03:48.70]Oh, he just drank blood.
[03:55.58]What is this?
[03:56.28]Is this an iteration?
[03:57.52]Look, chat, no, there's no way I'm not gonna cut my dick off.
[04:01.51]Holy shit, dude.
[04:03.17]Alright, that one's fucked up.
[04:05.18]That one's wicked fucked up.
[04:06.52]That's like a not okay one.
[04:08.70]That one's not okay.
[04:10.32]That one's not one we can paste as like a funny copy paster.
[04:13.80]Alright, guys.
[04:19.34]Yay for Jerma.
[04:25.46]Pasta, pasta, pasta, posta, posta.

[04:31.34]good hair it's it it is okay this part I'm not happy about I just go like that it's fine amazing hair where did you get that shirt uh from yeah from jackbox party pack this is not official merch uh I like I missed out on that one big time I think
[04:59.76]We gave like Jackbox like fucking 12 grand.
[05:06.14]Oops.
[05:12.50]Look at this dude.
[05:15.90]Where can I get that shirt?
[05:17.01]It's this like, look, I'll, I'll, alright.
[05:20.85]Long time ago, I was going to make a fireman t-shirt.
[05:25.11]You know me with merchandise.
[05:26.45]I suck.
[05:27.29]I just don't care.
[05:30.84]I do one shirt every three years.
[05:32.86]I know everybody wants it, but it's too much for me to do.
[05:38.76]And that's stupid, I know.
[05:44.37]We want it.
[05:45.07]I know, I know.
[05:46.01]But I'm just such a loser.
[05:48.17]I don't do merch.
[05:51.15]That means when merch does come out, though, it's rare as fuck.
[05:58.97]Make an official one.
[06:00.15]Maybe.
[06:05.63]you know here's the thing you know glue man the glue man shirt originally here's some some lore for you guys originally the glue man shirt was never going to be made ever again and I think only like I think like 1400 glue man shirts existed that was it so for like five years straight you if you owned a glue man shirt you were one of only like 1400 orders that was pretty limited and then that obviously that didn't last very long
[06:35.56]now you can get any you can get any I got well I got a t-shirt store on teespring one of two shirts you can buy right now this is not one of them this is not one of the official shirts oh we got glue man we got the night sky
[06:59.98]Coming soon, we've got the three singing rats for Christmas.
[07:04.02]Their heads are going to be up like... Singing.
[07:07.47]One, two, three.
[07:11.69]They're going to have Christmas hats on, all three of them.
[07:15.43]Heads up, singing.
[07:16.87]And you can see the little part of their mouth right here.
[07:18.99]Like, one, two, three.
[07:19.87]Fuck, I have to do that now.
[07:34.84]Hey, what time is it?
[07:35.40]It's not November, right?
[07:38.33]It's October.
[07:41.09]Okay.
[07:43.09]Let me look into that.
[07:43.83]That was a MonkaS.
[07:48.47]Let me look into that MonkaS.
[07:51.91]Fucking play already.
[07:53.01]I get you.
[07:55.50]You just made me kick my fucking VR headset right in the glass part, too.
[07:59.00]Ban that person.
[08:01.34]I just kicked the glass part.
[08:02.62]My heel went...
[08:05.80]I'm just trying, look, I'm going, I, we only got like enough three hours in the game anyways.
[08:11.92]That's not on me.
[08:17.08]This is, why is this a Reddit mug?
[08:18.91]Because it says the name Jay on it?
[08:27.53]Which is the first, the letter of my first name.
[08:33.08]That's not an egomaniac.
[08:34.74]Oh yeah, okay, I'm an egomaniac.
[08:36.95]What if this said number one best dad in the world?
[08:40.27]You don't think that's egomania?
[08:43.57]Number one best dad in the world.
[08:47.49]That doesn't say that.
[08:48.57]This doesn't say number one best Jeremy on Earth.
[08:53.05]I don't drink out of egomaniac mugs like that.
[08:55.37]I just want you to know who I am.
[08:58.64]This doesn't say this is the best Jeremy currently drinking this.
[09:07.28]And why am I stalling?
[09:08.31]I'll tell you.
[09:08.83]Because I don't want this to have any liquid in it before I start to get in the headset.
[09:14.29]Because this has coffee.
[09:15.83]Look.
[09:16.93]Look.
[09:18.57]I don't want to spill this, but look.
[09:20.70]Am I going to dump this on the fucking GoXLR?
[09:22.62]I almost just did.
[09:24.30]Look.
[09:24.66]Can you see?
[09:25.16]Here.
[09:28.50]Here.
[09:28.82]Have a sip.
[09:31.37]See?
[09:33.56]It looks like a fucking slush.
[09:35.49]That's ice.
[09:36.61]It's ice coffee, okay?
[09:39.65]I don't want that to spill.
[09:40.67]I'm gonna hit the keyboard and this thing's gonna fly in the air and dump all over the ground.
[09:46.09]It's ice.
[09:46.53]It's loaded with ice.
[09:47.47]What's going on with my wrist?
[09:53.57]How do I feel like I'm a VR character holding this in VR?
[10:00.14]Why does it look like that?
[10:07.66]Better.
[10:07.92]Okay.
[10:08.02]That was weird.
[10:12.52]Why do I feel like I can't hold this now?
[10:14.42]Why is it weird to hold this now?
[10:18.10]Like that.
[10:18.50]Okay, that's better.
[10:19.76]Alright, let me just finish this.
[10:27.54]There's a lot in here.
[10:30.38]I don't like drinking in front of people.
[10:31.82]You know that?
[10:33.26]You notice that?
[10:34.88]I hate drinking liquids in front of you guys.
[10:40.16]I don't know something about it.
[10:40.88]I just, I don't like it.
[10:42.02]I don't like people watching me eat, either.
[10:47.55]Bodwatcher, skip.
[10:48.37]You said 30 minutes.
[10:49.23]That was a lie.
[10:52.49]Stop stalling and drink.
[10:53.51]It's coffee.
[10:54.53]I don't want to just chug coffee.
[10:56.25]You've seen me, what I look like when I don't have coffee.
[10:59.84]You want me to drink this as fast as I can?
[11:01.50]I'll be like, I'll be bouncing off the walls.
[11:08.52]It's cold, too.
[11:09.42]It's too cold.
[11:12.31]Man discovers coffee.
[11:14.53]I drink coffee, like, every day, bro.
[11:17.73]I almost just, like, burp-puked into the microphone.
[11:21.53]Okay, I have a question.
[11:22.23]I have a question.
[11:23.60]How many... How many upvotes on, like, fuckface Reddit, right?
[11:27.42]On, like, this guy sucks.
[11:29.14]Like, on, like, holy shit, freak out.
[11:31.26]Like, what... And I know you like the weird fucking freak out Reddits, right?
[11:34.80]Like, if you saw them, but the microphone was right here.
[11:37.63]And I went, like...
[11:39.09]oh yeah bro and I like puked all over it and went like oh like does that have a thousand up votes two thousand up votes how many up votes it would be on live stream fails oh well whatever no it would not have a hundred thousand up votes
[12:06.58]Donald Trump could stand on stage and just piss his pants.
[12:10.88]Just pee.
[12:11.86]And you see the pee forming and going down the leg, just going... And that would get like 80,000 upvotes.
[12:17.94]That would not get 100,000 upvotes.
[12:19.23]It would probably get like 20,000.
[12:36.99]Are you doing political satire?
[12:38.47]What, is this that the president pees his pants on stage?
[12:40.83]80,000 up-foots.
[12:50.05]Oh, he's getting political.
[12:53.32]Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Donald Trump peed his pants?
[12:56.82]What's that mean?
[12:58.08]Why'd he say that?
[13:00.70]I wonder.
[13:02.78]He might be a Democrat.
[13:04.76]No, no.
[13:06.47]He might be one of those Republicans.
[13:10.60]He must be.
[13:19.74]Politics Andy.
[13:23.99]Omega Lull, our fuck face.
[13:27.53]Dude, you're freaking me out.
[13:29.99]That's VR streams.
[13:31.73]I let loose on VR streams because I get to stand up and move around.
[13:37.50]You guys understand that when I'm sitting here like this, and I have to sit here with a mouse in my hand, I cannot unleash.
[13:45.33]See?
[13:45.41]I have to go like this.
[13:47.41]Okay, let me move my mouse.
[13:49.23]No, I don't get to fucking, like, unleash.
[13:54.28]Alright, let's go.
[14:07.32]okay there's just ice in there now if I dock it over I don't care time for Half-Life: Alyx he's unhinged I can't stall 15 minutes for me to get ready we only have like another two hours in the game anyway
[14:37.49]Okay, so last we did, we did Jeff, which was ridiculous.
[14:45.10]That was probably top 10 worst things ever in VR, and not in a bad way.
[14:50.76]In like a holy shit, I hate this every second of this, it's real life, I don't like the glass, the glass shattering gives me nausea.
[14:58.50]It was insane.
[15:01.96]You know when you want to look up stuff about a game but you're not done with it yet?
[15:07.68]I really want to look up, like, oh, what was the scariest chapter in Half-Life Alyx, and why?
[15:13.21]I can't do that yet.
[15:15.47]I can't look up, like, oh, wait, what are the secrets of Jeff?
[15:18.81]Nope.
[15:19.75]I want to.
[15:23.13]Own it.
[15:30.18]Put the headset on.
[15:31.22]Just, hold on a second.
[15:37.26]Okay, that's right here.
[15:39.02]Look, you're gonna give, I gotta, I can't, I gotta unmute the game.
[15:41.82]So it's been 15 minutes.
[15:47.20]It's been like two hours.
[15:57.23]Okay.
[15:57.79]Ladies and gentlemen, get to the end of my Alex.
[16:10.31]it's comfy a little tight a little tight it's pissing me off I always do this why okay here's a pro tip for anybody developing a virtual reality headset
[16:29.02]Make these different colors.
[16:31.54]Like, oh, left is yellow and right is green.
[16:35.87]So, okay, I see green, right?
[16:37.61]Not like the tiny, teeny little R that's etched on the grain of rice down here.
[16:42.85]That's L. Okay, finally, finally, finally, finally, finally.
[17:01.36]Alright, this is chapter eight.
[17:04.96]It's called Key Activity.
[17:10.02]Welcome everybody to the stream.
[17:12.92]Hey, strap in.
[17:15.44]You've got, you notice how my voice is different because the headset's like pushing on my nose.
[17:20.64]So if I sound different, that's like why.
[17:22.12]People say, why does it sound so weird?
[17:23.72]Because if I have a huge fucking nose and this is just crushing it.
[17:32.98]Okay.
[17:34.04]This is where we left off.
[17:36.86]This is still broken, by the way.
[17:38.20]So going left is almost impossible.
[17:41.64]Thank God it's not used for anything else.
[17:43.37]Because I have to fucking crush it and it doesn't work half the time.
[17:47.91]Let's go.
[17:55.15]Where was I going?
[18:01.39]Oh.
[18:02.15]Landed you.
[18:09.33]It's called captivity.
[18:15.55]Fuck.
[18:17.57]Who's that?
[18:21.01]Oh, resume.
[18:27.58]Okay, when you play a lot of VR, anybody else get like this?
[18:30.86]Where, even in your real life,
[18:37.80]Shit feels like weird being alive in real life.
[18:42.74]This is why you can't be in here for that long.
[18:54.56]Like, when I was pouring my coffee this morning, it was like... Yeah, and then, like, the trash came and, like, flew at my face.
[19:10.24]It doesn't look right.
[19:25.49]Do not tell anybody to skip.
[19:27.95]Not yet.
[19:28.37]Is there a third one?
[19:51.03]Yep!
[19:56.68]Alright, what do I got?
[20:01.30]25 resin, that's good.
[20:02.10]Okay, what should I do?
[20:03.28]Chalk him?
[20:13.31]Ooh, double shot.
[20:14.87]That sounds kind of good.
[20:16.85]Adds the option to fire a second shot immediately after the first, so like, ba-boom.
[20:24.83]Ducks.
[20:26.66]Grenade launcher?
[20:27.78]Holy shit.
[20:36.60]It's don't, don't, don't.
[20:38.40]Alright, I won't.
[20:38.98]I'll tell him.
[20:43.82]Was there a dog out there?
[20:47.29]Hold on.
[20:47.61]Let me go get Otto.
[20:51.85]Otto.
[20:55.29]You want to come in?
[21:01.97]Come on.
[21:04.88]Hide down in this blanket over here.
[21:10.96]What do you want?
[21:12.93]He's lying down in front of the door, just wagging his tail, like, yeah, I just wanted you to open the door, I don't care.
[21:17.83]Come on, let's go get in here.
[21:20.29]You want to come in here and lie down over here?
[21:24.38]What are you doing?
[21:24.98]Well, I'm just going to leave the door open, because... What are you doing?
[21:31.46]Alright.
[21:39.36]No, he's just sleeping out there.
[21:40.64]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[21:42.38]What am I doing?
[21:45.35]Okay.
[21:49.19]I don't know where I was.
[21:51.78]This way.
[21:52.82]I'm going to save the resin.
[21:57.07]As dangerous?
[21:58.92]Um, he usually just kind of sits in the same spot.
[22:01.80]So, and like, here's the thing.
[22:04.48]I'm kind of like a, I'm like a bug.
[22:07.00]Like I can feel the vibrations in the ground.
[22:10.43]Like on my feet.
[22:12.51]If he, if that door opens, I will feel it.
[22:15.43]It's like a spider web.
[22:16.79]Like I can feel it in my, on like the bottoms of my feet.
[22:19.17]Alright, we need a power source.
[22:32.45]Alright, power.
[22:38.89]Cool.
[22:40.21]It looks like you're gonna have to go all the way to the antlion cave.
[22:45.84]Or not.
[22:46.90]It's literally right here.
[22:51.82]Need any res- any resin?
[22:56.46]Oh, that was easy.
[23:00.89]Jerma, get the gun.
[23:01.87]Jerma, gun, gun.
[23:02.95]Don't tell him.
[23:04.19]Don't tell him.
[23:04.67]What do you mean, get the gun?
[23:09.83]Gun.
[23:14.00]There is no gun.
[23:18.54]Power!
[23:20.92]Unlimited power!
[23:22.24]Total corruption!
[23:24.84]Total power!
[23:27.72]Yeah, I play Hearthstone.
[23:28.76]Whatever, man.
[23:40.00]That's an antlion, Russell.
[23:42.16]That's an antlion?
[23:43.48]Yes.
[23:44.60]Oh, shit.
[23:45.16]I do know what antlions are.
[23:46.72]Yes, they're leggy.
[23:48.12]God, the fucking... Wow, that would have been a disaster.
[23:51.20]Is it a grenade?
[23:52.73]No, it's a rotten apple.
[23:54.07]Same thing.
[23:54.57]Alright, if I were to leave this, would I ever be able to get it back?
[24:12.52]And in there.
[24:15.40]Okay.
[24:16.04]Antlions.
[24:17.64]Oh, wait.
[24:19.12]Oh, wait.
[24:21.90]Ooh, a clip.
[24:26.84]Egg.
[24:29.80]Well, there is, there are antlions in the game.
[24:31.65]I hate antlions.
[24:32.93]They're terrifying.
[24:33.75]Hold on, I gotta make this a little smaller for my tiny head.
[24:39.11]Here we go.
[24:42.79]I got my flashlights going.
[24:43.81]I don't like that.
[24:49.49]Afraid of bugs.
[24:52.07]What the f- Oh, no.
[24:58.69]I thought this- I thought Jeff was supposed to be the scary chapter, not the antlion chapter.
[25:07.93]Who isn't afraid of bugs?
[25:09.99]I feel like that's just a universal thing everybody agrees on.
[25:16.72]Where the fuck are you?
[25:17.44]I don't know where he is.
[25:18.70]I don't know where he is.

[32:36.31]This exhibit is currently closed for groups.
[32:38.19]It's going to break through the glass!
[32:43.39]I knew that was going to happen.
[32:45.58]The second that they give you this to look down at, oh, glass.

[33:10.05]Yeah, that's what that's for.
[33:11.11]I don't want to just get out of here.
[33:17.09]This place is awesome.
[33:24.01]This just reminds me of every single lizard or snake or tarantula exhibit you go look at.
[33:32.05]You go, oh, cool.
[33:34.11]What's it say there?
[33:35.23]Oh, giant fucking poisonous evil lizard.

[33:44.27]Where is he?
[33:48.29]Oh, oh, he's under that rock over there, sleeping.

[35:09.15]Uh, south, south, um, south Tennessee rattlesnake.
[35:16.44]It's like that.
[35:18.90]It's just that little piece right there, and it's coiled up over there.
[35:22.66]And you're looking over here trying to find the fucking thing.
[35:25.20]You're like, oh, where is he?
[35:26.32]He's huge and scary.
[35:27.82]No, he's like that little blob, and he's just like sitting right there.
[35:32.46]South, south, south, south Tennessee, yes.
[35:35.86]Really south, I'm talking like on the border.
[35:38.66]Right before you cross into Oklahoma.
[35:40.36]I don't know what's in the bottom of Tennessee, I don't know.
[35:43.04]I don't know what Tennessee touches on the bottom part.
[35:46.32]It's not Oklahoma.
[35:47.92]It's Kentucky?
[35:49.28]Top of Kentucky?
[35:50.08]I don't fucking know.
[35:55.63]I wanna see the lizard!
[35:57.65]Where is he?
[36:00.75]Don't get so close.
[36:01.89]No, but I can't see him.
[36:03.25]Is he in there?
[36:11.13]Is he in there, Mommy?
[36:12.95]No, don't go in there.
[36:14.17]Mommy, hold on.
[36:15.39]I want to find the lizard.
[36:21.15]Hey, any news on the datapod?
[36:23.21]Your dad's head's down.
[36:24.20]He's working on it.
[36:25.24]He's got to be close.
[36:26.54]Great.
[36:30.72]Where's the lizard?
[36:32.26]I don't know where he is.
[36:33.64]It's like the back room at the zoo.
[36:39.76]Food.
[36:40.07]There's dog food.
[36:41.77]Lizard.
[36:51.98]No.
[36:54.62]Lizard.
[37:09.54]I'm going to find Lizard and I'll be back.
[37:12.18]Get back here.
[37:16.56]Oh, I found Lizard.
[37:21.58]Oh, there's a tiger in here.
[37:25.22]Hold on mom, I'll take care of this.
[37:27.94]Oh no, it's a squirt gun.
[37:30.24]It's a squirt gun.
[37:31.22]Help, help, help, help, help, help, help.
[37:42.94]Oh my god, that's horrible.
[37:45.03]How do I shoot him?
[38:01.12]Oh shit.
[38:03.08]Oh no.
[38:13.52]Someone help him.
[38:16.48]What is going on in the back of the zoo?
[38:21.44]Oh, fuck.
[38:23.83]Timmy, worst Alex player on Twitch.
[38:26.11]Fuck, get out of here.
[38:27.75]I'm in chapter eight.
[38:28.71]It's been like eight hours.
[38:29.95]Hey, Jeff Keighley told me.
[38:35.62]Not personally, but through Twitter.
[38:38.24]It took him like 20 hours to beat this game because he was engrossed and he thought it was really fun.
[38:42.42]Okay?
[38:43.12]Do you trust Jeff Keighley?
[38:44.82]Because I do.
[38:46.74]That sounded really unhinged.
[38:48.01]Let's do that again.
[38:49.61]Jeff Keighley told me that this was like a 15 to 20 hour experience.
[38:53.39]I trust him.
[38:54.39]Don't you?
[38:55.59]I trust him.
[38:56.75]That's better.
[38:57.27]Okay.
[38:57.71]Use that one instead.
[38:59.52]Not the one where I was unhinged.
[39:05.42]Nice acting.
[39:06.26]No, give me that mask!
[39:07.36]It's mine!
[39:17.70]What the fuck?
[39:18.98]Dude, this shit is actually hard mode.
[39:44.54]Get it off.
[39:45.08]It's too hard.
[39:48.24]Bye, gameplay.
[39:52.54]I don't need to kill that one, but I do want to get rid of this one.
[39:55.42]No, I don't.
[39:55.84]Okay, uh... Bird in there?
[40:03.49]Bird's in there.
[40:07.85]I knew I saw something.
[40:21.15]Oh shit, now we're getting into it.
[40:23.73]Now we're getting into it.
[40:24.91]This is actually Jurassic Park and... Wait a minute.
[40:30.60]Why did... Some... Somebody make a Jurassic Park VR game.
[40:36.74]Are you kidding me?
[40:37.58]Why has nobody done that yet?
[40:39.27]It's like the perfect platform for like a scary watch out for the raptors they're gonna chase you.
[40:43.43]This exact environment.
[40:58.95]That's how you can tell that the devs just did such a fucking good job.
[41:02.99]I'm getting immersed in Jurassic Park and it's not even that game.
[41:33.09]Uh-oh.
[41:34.45]Uh-oh.
[41:35.09]Uh-oh.
[41:38.35]Uh-oh.
[41:40.57]Uh-oh.
[41:41.29]That was one shot, one kill.
[41:44.68]Ooh, a grenade.
[41:49.56]Open.
[41:57.72]He sounds so sad when you take it.
[41:59.05]He's like, ow!
[42:07.15]Adam.
[42:08.03]Can I have another one, please?
[42:13.14]Is that again?
[42:25.78]Is that again?
[42:32.48]Chrono Trigger.
[42:33.02]That's the sound effect from Chrono Trigger.
[42:35.24]That's the sound that makes a lot of enemies make this like... It's that exact sound.
[42:40.14]I think it's the same sound.
[42:43.38]You guys know what I'm talking about?
[43:00.09]Oh, we're good.
[43:02.61]Alright, grenade in there.
[43:03.67]Oh, there's a lot of grenades just everywhere.
[43:09.07]I don't know why.
[43:11.09]Goodbye.
[43:16.23]I threw them and it scared me.
[43:19.18]It doesn't matter.
[43:24.56]Why is there so many of these?
[43:29.40]There could be something fucked up down here, I know it.
[43:44.87]Ugh.
[43:45.93]Oh, shit.
[43:46.65]Come on, hop!
[44:02.08]Oh, there's a lot.
[44:03.22]What the hell is even in here?
[44:12.04]Why is all this shit blowing up around me?
[44:13.90]I missed the story.
[44:28.65]Missed the story?
[44:32.11]It doesn't look like they actually built the weapon.
[44:34.55]It's like they, I don't know, discovered something.
[44:37.43]Or maybe they uncovered it.
[44:39.45]What do you mean?
[44:40.85]If I'm reading this right, they tracked it to an old apartment building in the QC.
[44:45.42]But instead of going in to get it, they grabbed the whole building and built a vault around it.
[44:50.14]Oh, God.
[44:52.02]Holy crap.
[44:52.90]They must have been terrified of this thing.
[44:55.14]I'm trying to figure out whether we ought to be.
[44:58.73]Alright, that was a good story.
[45:01.13]I'd like to hear a little more.
[45:06.83]Oh, he's got a mask on.
[45:09.02]That's, oh, we lost it.
[45:10.90]Lost it.
[45:14.34]But, um, excuse me.
[45:16.08]Now's not the time for you to do this.
[45:17.46]Now's not the time for you to do this.
[45:18.98]Now's not the time.
[45:19.66]Now's not the time.
[45:20.76]Now's not the time.
[45:29.33]I don't wanna waste ammo.
[45:38.65]Give me it!
[45:47.01]Alright, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[46:01.66]I didn't want to waste a bunch of ammo.
[46:02.79]That would have been like 10 shots.
[46:11.05]I hear something.
[46:13.32]Oh, now you want to give it to me.
[46:14.58]Not when there's danger around.
[46:15.74]Oh, my goodness.
[46:16.92]Where did he go?
[46:34.73]Oh, now it's so easy!
[46:35.77]Still a voice.
[46:45.37]Oh, there's a bunch of supplies in here.
[46:48.89]Thanks for telling me to go back.
[46:50.97]Imagine if I didn't get this supply.
[46:57.10]What the fuck?
[46:57.70]No way!
[46:58.20]A GTX 780?!
[46:59.08]Dude, I'll be able to play at 60!
[47:13.02]Hey, over here?
[47:16.68]780, that's trash.
[47:20.00]780's not trash.
[47:22.53]You can still play a decent amount of games on 780.
[47:24.77]Guys, not everybody wants to play every game at, like, 4K.
[47:29.31]I can't get up there?
[47:33.62]480p.
[47:33.72]Um, no.
[47:43.02]No, you could definitely run, like, Counter-Strike at, like, 1080, 40.
[47:48.85]But does it really matter?
[47:49.65]Some people don't care.
[47:50.35]Guys, if you think people really care that much, where are you?
[47:56.03]If you think people care that much about, like, frame rates and resolutions, we played on the fucking PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 for two decades.
[48:03.72]That shit was running, like, 25, 1080, 60, 720.
[48:05.16]You think people really care that much?
[48:13.30]I mean, I do.
[48:14.80]And you do.
[48:15.32]Puma and I can't even see past eight frames a second anyways.
[48:25.01]My doctor told me.
[48:25.63]What the hell is this?
[48:32.49]Russ, do you think a headcrab could turn a gorilla into a zombie?
[48:37.54]Honestly, if there's a gorilla on the loose, I'm not sure a headcrab could make it much worse.
[48:42.72]Is this foreshadowing?
[48:43.58]Are we going to have to fight a giant gorilla with a headcrab on him?
[48:48.24]Oh no, that would be bad.
[48:49.52]That would be very bad, actually.
[48:53.45]Is this why you wanted me to come in here?
[49:11.09]Alright, let's go.
[49:12.19]I saw the gorilla, cool.
[49:16.35]How is this lore?
[49:17.71]I skipped lore?
[49:20.52]It's just, hey look, there's a statue of a gorilla over here.
[49:29.14]No, no, I didn't see like 10 minutes of extra dialogue and lore, I just wasted 10 minutes looking at a statue.
[49:40.48]Precious time.
[49:42.36]Playing Half-Life.
[49:45.46]Birds.
[49:45.70]I love birds.
[49:49.08]I really do.
[49:49.68]I love birds.
[49:50.82]Especially crows.
[49:51.92]I love crows.
[49:53.09]I think they're the smartest, most awesome animal.
[49:55.17]Next to a rat.
[49:56.37]I'm seeing a pattern, though.
[50:00.15]I like fucking crows and, like, rats.
[50:03.57]I like all the things that the Bible tells you to avoid because they're gonna possess you and kill you.
[50:08.92]Why?
[50:10.19]Isn't that weird?
[50:14.76]Aren't like crows and rats and all kinds of... Aren't they like the dirty animals in the Bible?
[50:22.12]They look like... They look like... Satanists.
[50:24.68]You're a Satanist.
[50:25.68]Alright, is it Satanist or is it Satanist?
[50:32.45]I'm a Satanist.
[50:33.69]I don't... I don't think... I don't like... What, you think I like to worship Satan?
[50:41.66]No, why would I do that?
[50:50.48]Stuttering, because he's a Satanist.
[50:57.03]Okay, telling me that I'm a Satanist doesn't mean that I practice Satanism.
[51:01.57]Like, I turn the lights off and I put a bunch of red candles around me and I sit in the middle and I start asking for fucking, like, plagues and shit.
[51:07.90]Like, what does that mean?
[51:10.78]I'm not a practicing Satanist.
[51:13.80]I don't care.
[51:14.24]What do you want me to tell you?
[51:15.24]Dark Lord, surround me with people.
[51:33.21]Tell my enemies who I really am.
[51:37.55]Tell my friends I'm worth it.
[51:42.28]Give me the strength.
[51:44.75]Hopefully, you give me some kind of superpowers, because that's really what I want.
[51:48.11]So... Fill me with your fear and your... You know, I could really use, you know, like, Venom?
[51:56.31]I would love the Venom symbiote, like, to be in me right now, and we could, like, go on adventures and shit.
[52:01.41]You know, if you want me to be your... Come on, I could use the superpowers if the intercom is working.
[52:08.43]Okay.
[52:10.02]Try next week, another series of candles.
[52:17.84]Oh, an offering!
[52:22.47]No way, dude, it worked!
[52:28.73]Okay, I'm gonna tell the world.
[52:35.52]Ooh, fish.
[52:38.29]Dude, Satan coming through with a clutch.
[52:45.25]Why am I carrying this around still?
[52:47.13]But no, I thought I don't practice Satanism.
[52:48.78]I don't practice anything.
[52:51.84]I don't practice setting up my streams.
[52:53.76]I don't practice the drums.
[52:54.78]I don't practice religion.
[52:56.50]I'm practice-less.
[52:57.82]I don't do anything.
[53:00.18]Okay, is like eating Cheetos on the couch me practicing anything?
[53:04.59]And, like, watching Netflix?
[53:06.57]Does that count?
[53:08.11]I'm a practicing Netflix viewer.
[53:14.33]Yes, practice me.
[53:16.25]Alright, ban that guy.
[53:24.03]Ow.
[53:26.81]Why am I carrying this?
[53:28.79]This is like a stress ball at this point.
[53:31.41]Like...
[53:33.74]It's okay, the antlions can't get me.
[53:38.02]Ow, who are you?
[53:40.88]I actually really like this area, though.
[53:42.14]I don't see very many, like, zoo exhibits.
[53:51.83]Oh, you can't get me, there's glass.
[54:02.72]I know they're all connected up here, can I, like, pull the grenade up and over into his chamber?
[54:07.86]Oh my god, okay.
[54:09.32]I knew it.
[54:09.76]Okay.
[54:22.01]I'm just waiting for that gorilla with the head grab.
[54:24.35]I know it's gonna happen.
[54:25.49]You guys made me go look at that for some reason.
[54:37.38]I'm sorry, what?
[54:38.12]What animal was in there?
[54:40.36]Thank you, I'll take that, thank you.
[54:48.96]Alright, I'm ready.
[54:57.49]Wait, they were shooting at the aliens.
[54:58.77]Why did I just do that?
[54:59.61]They could've helped.
[55:00.23]Kinda gross, whatever that is.
[55:14.03]Oh, this is broken.
[55:14.85]I'm going to have to get a... You know what?
[55:17.15]I think this is a good indicator that I'm just going to get the knuckle controllers.
[55:19.92]Because this is actually broken.
[55:23.70]Wait a minute.
[55:24.04]This... This is the T-Rex scene.
[55:27.86]This is actually the T-Rex scene.
[55:30.88]This truck flipped over and the kids are watching the drink.
[55:35.66]Right?
[55:37.26]Pato, you want to get out?
[55:39.39]I can feel the vibrations, he wants to get up.
[55:40.76]Alright, go on, go on.
[55:42.90]I'm telling you, I can feel the vibrations.
[55:52.84]The turn was not... Holy shit, that was so horrible.
[56:09.52]Not prepared for that.
[56:11.12]It's not even on my head.
[56:12.27]I'm underwater right now.
[56:14.33]I can't even see what I'm shooting at.
[56:16.45]It's just blurry.
[56:17.87]It's just blurry.
[56:18.51]I held my eyes underwater in a chlorine pool.
[56:26.86]What?
[56:50.31]Okay, can I please put my headset back on normal, right, correctly, please?
[56:56.91]Alright, we're good.
[57:04.87]Fucking pause the game.
[57:07.17]I don't have to.
[57:07.89]Oh, now there's like, there's just like, gross stuff in here now.
[57:14.08]That's another thing that sucks about VR.
[57:15.66]When you take the headset off, the sweat from your hair drags across both lenses.
[57:21.04]And then when you put it back on, it's over.
[57:22.84]You have to clean the whole thing.
[57:31.69]Pause the game.
[57:32.65]I'm good.
[57:33.89]I can see him.
[57:34.93]I have the stream preview right there.
[57:40.46]Oh, dude.
[57:41.00]Gamer grease.
[57:42.44]That's disgusting, but I'll let it pass.
[57:45.82]No, you know what?
[57:46.40]Time them out for five minutes.
[57:50.95]That's disgusting.
[57:54.97]That's just, that's gross.
[57:56.11]Like, don't say gross things in my stream.
[57:59.55]We have to keep it, it's PG-13.
[58:00.95]Remember?
[58:04.23]Don't do this shit.
[58:05.73]This is a PG-13 stream.
[58:07.43]I know you clicked on mature R-rated content.
[58:12.01]But that's how I act.
[58:13.97]You have to act a certain way.
[58:15.45]I act, like, R-rated, and you act PG.
[58:17.91]And if you act R, then you get banned.
[58:19.77]Right?
[58:19.97]That's how it works on Twitch, isn't it?
[58:24.23]You say something gross, then you get banned.
[58:25.84]If I say something gross, look at me.
[58:27.18]That hit somebody.
[58:32.28]That hit somebody.
[58:33.30]Somebody was just sneaking up behind me, and it hit them in the fucking face.
[58:37.46]Thank you.
[58:37.96]I got it.
[58:40.45]Oh no, how do I get an ammo?
[58:41.49]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[58:47.17]Good.
[58:48.76]Alright, we gotta get this chamber.
[58:52.80]Oh, we got five community subs from Nukable.
[58:57.28]Thank you, Nukable.
[58:58.32]Thanks for the five subs.
[58:59.16]Welcome, guys.
[59:01.32]Hey, we love our subs here.
[59:08.34]Hey, we love our subs here.
[59:16.29]Is that all you got?
[59:18.79]I love this area.
[59:19.63]This is my favorite area of the game so far.
[59:31.04]It's like smoky in here.
[59:41.55]This is the best area of the game.
[59:43.05]Yeah, for sure.
[59:43.85]I love it.
[59:46.01]For me, I like this better than kind of just the city 17 corridors and buildings I mean, it's cool like nostalgia purposes, but this is new shit.
[59:54.85]This is new shit.
[59:56.07]I like it a lot From a moon rising
[60:17.73]Yeah, we don't want that.
[60:20.67]I would have just walked into that.
[60:22.48]Good thing I'm hyper-intelligent.
[60:26.14]Dr. Knapp, I'm calling to say that I'm reporting a suspect.
[60:31.10]Suspect neutralized.
[60:33.38]Call off entire investigation.
[60:35.43]Order me number one on Postmates.
[60:43.53]And drop it off at the door where the electricity room is.
[60:46.98]Don't come in, I'm busy!
[61:02.81]Oh my god, there's an explosive!
[61:07.92]No, bring this in here with me!
[61:09.32]He's gonna walk into the ship!
[61:10.52]I'm gonna sit here and close the door!
[61:14.00]Don't touch it!
[61:16.12]He's gonna walk into that.
[61:17.18]It's not gonna explode.
[61:20.91]Okay, how do I- can I- can I take all the air out of that thing?
[61:23.43]Can I just, like, go?
[61:27.89]But when the door closes, I'll pass out.
[61:29.65]That'll fuck me up, won't it?
[61:39.49]What do I do with all this stuff?
[61:45.12]It's the Postmates guy.
[61:51.49]Hey.
[61:52.99]Hey, dude.
[61:53.35]Yeah, I know you drove by the house like four or five times.

[62:00.79]I'll go get it.
[62:02.65]I know it's hard to find.
[62:03.93]Just leave it out on the curb, dude.
[62:07.54]He leaves it out on the curb and another car drives by and just runs over your lunch box.
[62:16.80]Oh!
[62:19.34]I'm fucking out of here.
[62:22.74]Don't throw that.
[62:23.48]Where is he?

[62:32.86]I don't want to use it,
[62:42.90]Okay.
[62:44.40]Over here.
[62:45.45]Just leave it at the door.
[62:47.67]He's stuck over there.
[62:48.83]I just turned him off.
[62:50.11]He's not gonna get over here in time.
[62:52.87]Wait, maybe he is.
[62:53.45]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[62:57.31]I'm realizing this right now.

[63:11.01]The little thing opens, and here's your lunch, you bastard.
[63:27.09]Okay, I think I'm safe.

[63:49.71]There's something else here Where is he Where did that guy go?
[64:12.33]Amber mode activated.
[64:14.89]Later.
[64:18.41]I think I did it too early.
[64:20.53]I've done that so many times.
[64:31.82]I can't do the, like, foo thing every time I kill somebody.
[64:36.10]I'm gonna make a compilation of that, and it's gonna be... painful.
[64:41.16]Oh, drink it!
[64:45.83]You have to.
[64:46.50]No, I don't.
[64:47.60]Oh, there it is.
[64:50.34]Uh, I don't even need it, though.
[64:51.42]I really don't even need it.
[64:54.78]Put on ammo.
[64:55.58]Good, good, good, good, good, good.
[64:57.38]Okay, we're good.
[64:58.10]Good.
[65:10.28]I really like the SMG.
[65:13.70]I feel like the grenade launcher is cool and it might be fun, but how many grenades am I going to find from here on out?
[65:20.62]I don't think very many.
[65:34.98]Will they make a dead space in VR?
[65:36.64]I've never played them, but I know how they work.
[65:39.97]Imagine like a Dead Space VR.
[65:42.68]Those of you that have played the game, I'm just pretending to be a fan.
[65:45.70]That's how it works.
[66:02.72]I told you he was alive.
[66:04.44]He was alive.
[66:05.64]I told you.
[66:07.83]Everyone that tells me that I shouldn't have been doing that all game.
[66:10.84]Right?
[66:11.64]You were sitting there waiting.
[66:12.58]I shot him in the head and I killed him and he dropped the grenade.
[66:16.82]Yes, you can thank me.
[66:19.40]Thank me for being fucking aware.
[66:20.62]Headspace is third person.
[66:25.71]Stop pretending to be a streamer.
[66:28.43]What the hell would you call me then?
[66:32.47]What else am I?
[66:35.05]Bill's here!
[66:38.79]Kills here.
[66:40.51]Kills here.
[66:41.39]Kills.
[66:43.99]Kills.
[66:45.27]No, this is it.
[66:46.19]This is the correct reference.
[66:51.96]Kills here.
[66:54.44]Use that part when you make the video.
[66:56.20]Make it a quick cut so it's just like, something crazy, and then back to the action.
[67:06.81]It's a prison.
[67:08.17]They didn't build it to keep us out.
[67:10.06]They're trying to keep something in.
[67:12.06]Keep what in?
[67:13.40]I don't know.
[67:14.46]I'm not sure if this data part even knows.
[67:16.62]But they got something trapped in there.
[67:18.96]Oh.
[67:20.28]OK.
[67:22.06]So if it's not a weapon, are we still doing this?
[67:25.70]The way I see it, whatever's in there doesn't like the Combine very much.
[67:28.64]Whatever's in there?
[67:29.42]So we got that in common.
[67:30.98]We're going to turn out to be the gorilla with the head cap?
[67:33.88]Are we still doing this?
[67:35.58]We've come this far.
[67:37.74]I say we keep going.
[67:39.48]And if you find out it's something we really shouldn't mess with, we'll call it off.
[67:43.32]That's my girl.
[67:44.85]I'll let you know what I find out.
[67:47.73]They're keeping the gorilla in there.
[67:50.55]Oh.
[67:52.29]Explosive.
[67:56.37]Explosive.
[67:57.96]I'm so far away right now.
[68:01.70]I'm so far away.
[68:02.90]Parties.
[68:08.39]Metallica?
[68:14.05]Who sings that?
[68:14.59]Is that Metallica?
[68:17.78]Shoot them.
[68:18.16]What a waste of ammo.
[68:20.36]What is that?
[68:22.60]Does God smack?
[68:29.04]Why did that pop in here?
[68:33.25]The word I haven't heard that toast two words.
[68:49.50]Oh, wait, that's just to turn on these lights.
[68:52.95]Hold on.
[68:53.41]No, no, no, no, no.
[68:54.19]That goes up here.
[68:56.91]That goes up there.
[68:59.29]And then it goes down this way.
[69:02.07]If I turn something on.
[69:03.59]Couldn't this don't fall?
[69:08.63]Yeah, I bet it won't be here anymore.
[69:11.53]I'm fucking livid.
[69:14.49]No, I crushed Jeff.
[69:15.92]He's not coming back.
[69:20.96]Got him.
[69:23.46]Got him.
[69:30.88]Button, I guess.
[69:31.60]I can't press it.
[69:32.96]We can go in there.
[69:35.68]Here.
[69:39.73]There.
[69:42.31]Shit, okay, so what the heck is going on here?
[69:47.82]Power for this, we gotta turn the power off here.
[69:51.90]We don't, actually.
[69:55.82]Am I missing something here?
[70:05.29]Alright, so where the fuck does this go?
[70:16.04]Green wire.
[70:17.88]Here.
[70:20.30]Oh, my God.

[81:50.22]Alright, let's get out of here.
[81:57.32]Get out.
[82:00.18]Wait, can I draw on the walls?
[82:03.98]Oh, come on.
[82:04.97]I can't do like an elaborate painting?
[82:07.41]That's unfortunate.
[82:10.87]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[82:17.74]Closed.
[82:21.56]Wait, wait, wait, wait, are you- Do I actually have to- I don't- I have to- I don't- do I really- do I have to open the door with this shit?
[82:34.77]I have to redirect the power again?
[82:36.51]No, dude, I don't want to redirect the power!
[82:44.78]Wait, I turned it off, right?
[82:46.06]So that doesn't matter anymore, does it?
[82:49.18]Where you going?
[82:56.53]I turned the power off.
[82:58.85]I pulled the lever.
[83:00.21]Turned it off.
[83:00.77]Yeah, we're good.
[83:01.91]We're good.
[83:02.23]We're good.
[83:02.55]We're good.
[83:09.20]Ace.
[83:12.69]This is the gate.
[83:13.74]Don't leave it there.
[83:15.38]I know.
[83:40.90]I wanna jump over the fucking barrels!
[83:50.64]Those of you wondering why... Nevermind.
[83:52.92]Boom.
[83:54.18]Boom boom boom boom boom!
[84:03.06]Oh my god, that hurt.
[84:04.84]Oh my god, that's scary.
[84:06.92]Oh my god, that's loud and scary.
[84:13.22]How did you even hit me?
[84:13.96]Nice hit registry.
[84:28.09]That's all you guys had?
[84:28.97]Just one measly little clip?
[84:32.95]I was just threw up.
[84:33.85]Whatever.
[84:46.99]Where's the healing device?
[84:48.75]Isn't it right here somewhere?
[84:49.63]There's a full heal somewhere.
[84:52.53]I don't remember where it is.
[85:01.67]There it is.
[85:02.81]I don't have a thing.
[85:06.56]Heal games have been developed so well.
[85:11.30]Thank you, Valve.
[85:13.56]Good devs.
[85:15.34]Good devs.
[85:29.99]Hey, come back and use it if I need to.
[85:32.89]What are you doing on ammo?
[85:36.45]Not bad.
[85:38.03]Good.
[85:47.70]Oh.
[85:49.72]Eyes ahead, right there.
[85:52.84]Ooh.
[86:00.44]Imagine healing the right hand.
[86:08.99]Insert the next disc.
[86:27.08]Loading in 2020.
[86:27.90]It's a VR game.
[86:29.88]You know how intense this shit is?
[86:35.32]I'm actually surprised how much they're able to do without a loading screen.
[86:38.51]You guys have to remember, most VR games, they're one room that you just exist in for like an hour.
[86:47.25]This is a full... We're going down hallways.
[86:49.39]We're opening doors.
[86:51.15]Most VR games don't do this.
[86:54.98]One room.
[87:03.64]Still fun.
[87:05.58]Anything on you?
[87:07.04]Don't do it.
[87:07.70]It's not even worth it.
[87:08.48]It's wasting ammo.
[87:16.11]Cool.
[87:16.35]Alright, let's go.
[87:19.23]Chapter 10.
[87:19.53]Attack of the Clones.
[87:28.98]Good luck trying to lock out someone wielding an Alex.
[87:34.02]Oh.
[87:34.08]That was the gorilla?
[87:37.10]Don't say that.
[87:38.28]I- I- I'm inclined to believe you.
[87:52.62]Oh shit.
[87:55.61]Oh, they got it.
[87:57.87]That's it.
[88:00.41]Oh, it's coming down.
[88:01.73]Catch it.
[88:15.99]Okay, oh I press this button
[88:48.75]Welcome.
[88:50.35]Welcome all of you to the Hunger Games.
[88:53.31]I'm President Davidson.
[88:56.81]Tonight, you've never seen this movie before, but you just think this is how it started.
[89:03.80]You imagine this is how that movie starts.
[89:06.42]You haven't read the books.
[89:07.24]You haven't seen any media of it.
[89:09.00]You've just seen on the side of buses, Katniss going like this with a bow and arrow.
[89:14.72]This is how it starts.
[89:16.34]And all the subjects are down there.
[89:20.25]And you know the name.
[89:23.87]Davidson, huh?
[89:28.75]You didn't like it.
[89:31.63]Alright, this is going to be a fight here.
[89:37.78]Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.
[89:40.20]How fast can you guys do that?
[89:44.96]Well, this is your time to use this shit, don't you think so?
[89:48.44]I think so, folks.
[89:54.85]Oh my, that's a lot of people.
[89:56.82]Oh shit, he's behind me!
[89:57.42]Oh shit, that's empty!
[91:04.25]I thought it was the shelf.
[91:06.41]I thought it was the shelf.
[91:07.52]It's you.
[91:08.82]I'm sorry.
[91:09.40]It was you guys.
[91:11.26]I just backed up in the desk.
[91:14.04]Okay, I'm ready.
[91:15.75]Everything's loaded, everything's primed, everything's ready to shoot, everything's got plenty of bullets, let's move on.
[91:34.18]Oh my god.
[91:36.02]Thank you!
[91:51.96]Thanks, dude.
[91:52.40]I appreciate it.
[91:54.76]Appreciate you, man.
[91:55.79]Appreciate you.
[91:56.95]Hey, okay.
[91:58.75]Is this because I leave a two-star review?
[92:01.73]I'm sorry.
[92:04.87]Is this because of the 10% tip?
[92:06.29]Oh, shit.
[92:26.04]Don't ever make your head.
[92:35.96]If you're gonna shoot for the king, don't miss.
[92:54.41]Don't miss!
[93:01.46]You're going to go up to the king.
[93:02.34]Make sure you fill him with like 20 bullet holes and not 8.
[93:07.61]I'm going to be alive.
[93:12.51]I need health.
[93:16.71]Hey, fellas.
[93:21.82]Oh.
[93:22.72]Back up there.
[93:23.30]Never mind.
[93:29.22]Everybody needs to practice in DM servers.
[93:33.23]I just did fine.
[93:35.03]I just did fine.
[93:35.51]Like 10, 20 enemies at the same time.
[93:39.87]Looking for like health pack or something of some sort.
[93:42.55]Why is that open?
[93:53.62]Health pack.
[93:54.96]Something.
[93:55.62]I can feel my heart pulsing here.
[94:06.18]DM instant respawn 24-7.
[94:08.64]You know what's bad about 24-7 servers is you'll get in there and there's no map change.
[94:14.16]The timer is at like 16 hours.
[94:16.80]You know, you look up at the clock and it's like, oh yeah, there's like 845 minutes left.
[94:22.67]Okay, and you get trapped in there and you can't leave.
[94:27.27]You look at the clock after like six hours, you've been in the same map shooting the same people.
[94:33.75]It's like being in a casino.
[94:35.33]There's no clocks in a casino.
[94:37.07]You're just stuck at the slot machine.
[94:38.23]You don't even know where you are.
[94:40.41]That's why I don't like to play those.
[94:43.04]Your mouth just stays open and you're just like, oh, right.
[94:46.34]I used to drink a 12-pack of Code Red Mountain Dew every other day, just sitting there doing that.
[94:52.94]On original Team Fortress Classic, I forget what the map was, but there was a map where you could go, I think it was Well.
[94:59.09]I would play Well, like, every day.
[95:00.91]The original Well.
[95:05.58]Not the casino.
[95:06.70]Don't throw a grenade in there, I need that.
[95:17.55]Just throw this out.
[95:25.23]I'll take it.
[95:27.60]I'll take it.
[95:46.63]Any of you guys that have ever lived underneath somebody in an apartment building?
[95:51.76]You gotta listen to this fuckin' TV every day.
[95:57.44]Okay, do you really have to have the TV at 10 volume?
[96:00.23]You can't do it at like 7 or 8?
[96:01.95]Where are you in your house that you have to have the TV that loud?
[96:04.45]I never got that.
[96:05.11]I never fucking understood that.
[96:08.31]Like, are you in the bathroom with the door closed with the TV at max volume trying to listen to whatever's on the TV 10 rooms down in your house?
[96:15.21]I don't understand.
[96:15.93]Why do people do that?
[96:19.18]Good joke, but I'm not making a joke.
[96:20.32]This sucks.
[96:21.16]Don't do this to people.
[96:24.08]I'm just getting like flashbacks.
[96:26.50]Wait, I am my own supervisor?
[96:32.24]I am my own supervisor.
[96:34.18]Okay.
[96:58.72]Is it going up?
[97:07.42]Are we about to like sneak into this lady's place or something?
[97:10.06]What am I doing here?
[97:17.24]I should go.
[97:17.82]Wall dad.
[97:19.74]What you listening to?
[97:21.50]Wonder what that is.
[97:23.45]We love this show.
[97:35.53]Hi, okay, finally.
[97:37.03]Hi.
[97:38.60]We need to move the box or this thing is going to be Black Mesa all over again.
[97:45.08]Black Mesa.
[97:45.52]Well, now I'm telling you it is, Ray.
[97:48.40]Oh shit, it's one of those worms.
[97:49.74]When she gets there, he's gone.
[97:54.01]What in the history of today makes you think you're going to stop her?
[97:58.15]But this guy who got in there survived Black Mesa.
[98:01.23]He raised holy hell and then just disappeared.
[98:03.71]We finally caught him and you're just going to let him go again?
[98:06.77]Move the box.
[98:09.84]Talking about Gordon Freeman.
[98:11.02]Survived Black Mesa, then disappeared.
[98:13.84]Eli, they do have a super weapon.
[98:15.80]God damn it, Russ, they got Gordon Freeman.
[98:17.76]Gordon Freeman.
[98:18.44]Wow.
[98:19.68]That's good, right?
[98:20.86]This is very, very good.
[98:23.58]This is a miracle.
[98:24.98]Alright.
[98:25.90]So?
[98:27.22]Let's go save Gordon Freeman.
[98:28.64]Wait, we have to save Gordon Freeman?
[98:31.29]Oh, incoming.
[98:33.33]Hey, give me a second.
[98:58.30]Oh, thanks for the exit, idiot!
[99:01.59]Alex?
[99:04.05]Alex, you still there?
[99:06.35]No, I'm not!
[99:07.99]Grenade room.
[99:19.13]Well, look, I figured out that you have to blow up the wall.
[99:22.27]I had to do that, I just was too slow.
[99:27.25]It's Gordon.
[99:28.25]Holy shit.
[99:29.21]It's Gordon Freeman.
[99:31.95]I can't wait till the last frame of this game is you're in a room and all of a sudden you see we're going to be the start of Half-Life 2.
[99:40.26]Gordon Freeman.
[99:40.74]We're going to be in that room in the very beginning.
[99:42.10]Gordon Freeman.
[99:42.50]We're going to be like hiding behind a fucking barrel and we're going to look up and see the start of Half-Life 2 and he's going to look right back in the camera and he's going to be like and then he's going to keep walking and right that first beginning he's going to pick up that can, right?
[99:54.11]That's going to happen.
[99:56.08]Let's go save Gordon Freeman.
[99:57.32]It's going to be seamless.
[99:59.90]Oh, incoming.
[100:01.98]Hey, give me a second.
[100:03.10]Alright, incoming.
[100:17.42]Alright, blow it open.

[102:26.70]Wow, you, did you just, who, Gordon Freeman?
[102:29.78]I didn't play Half-Life.
[102:30.70]This is a new VR game that came out.
[102:32.19]Like, sorry, blame me for them not making a new iteration for 12 years.
[102:36.05]I don't know who that is.
[102:38.13]I just bought a new VR game.
[102:39.57]What the fuck?
[102:46.19]Big fan.
[102:51.91]No, I need a silencer.
[102:55.09]I need to actually use this.
[103:12.68]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[103:23.59]Do what I like to watch.

[103:45.01]Oh, yeah.
[103:45.37]Wait, can I get in there?
[103:46.99]I didn't explore over here yet.
[103:52.37]Gotta turn that off.
[103:54.95]I say you got it.
[104:01.11]Okay, I thought that was one of those explosive tripwires.
[104:03.81]How did they get in there?
[104:24.59]Did she jump on there?
[104:27.17]Wait.
[104:28.35]Oh.
[104:30.15]I actually might be able to glitch that.
[104:35.21]That's really possible.
[104:38.20]There's a box up there.
[104:38.72]Is that box?
[104:39.22]I don't think we're made.
[105:00.20]Alright.
[105:01.52]Oh, by the way, those of you that are wondering why I have to always put it in my right hand, my left hand hitting that top button and holding the trigger at the same time is my... I can't do it.
[105:11.11]My fingers can't do it.
[105:11.83]It hurts.
[105:13.79]I physically can't do it.
[105:16.65]I always end up dropping it.
[105:17.51]Electricity minigame coming up.
[105:30.54]Nothing under this.
[105:31.16]I wanted it.
[105:52.15]I want that.
[105:58.19]I know I get it, man.
[106:00.17]Oh my god, I fell.
[106:01.02]Alright.
[106:04.30]I don't think I can do that.
[106:33.66]How are they doing that
[107:04.50]Jumping to Almost got it almost
[107:36.53]Where do I go?
[107:37.95]I can't go down there.
[107:40.91]Wait a minute.
[107:46.02]Why up here?
[107:49.26]God, this is weird, right?
[107:54.84]What am I doing over here?
[107:57.46]Why am I removing these?
[108:04.81]Nothing, actually.
[108:06.99]fall?
[108:07.55]I'm so scared of falling down a gap.
[108:10.04]Jump down?
[108:10.68]I don't know if I should... I die when I fall.
[108:18.80]That happens.
[108:20.24]Fall joke.
[108:20.72]Fall joke.
[108:21.24]Stop pretending.
[108:22.41]I don't... I don't... Okay.
[108:27.71]Every time I've ever done something like this, I've died.
[108:34.70]Hey, you stop pretending.
[108:36.70]You pretend to tell me that I'm pretending.
[108:39.50]Shit.
[108:45.70]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[108:50.03]Shit, buddy.
[108:56.57]I don't know, I can do that again, can't I?
[109:01.07]My eyes!
[109:09.87]That was fucking scary.
[109:12.28]Right in the eyes.
[109:22.94]This game's really fun.
[109:25.54]This is one of the good ones.
[109:31.94]Oh no.
[109:32.16]Can I get in there and open this from the other side?
[109:34.17]Can I get in there?
[109:36.69]Yes, I can.
[109:47.86]Makeup kiss?
[109:57.91]Oh.
[110:04.03]Now what?
[110:04.35]Now what?
[110:04.91]Now what?
[110:05.27]Somebody tell me!
[110:06.95]Oh, right there.
[110:10.57]Boink.
[110:23.02]That's not going to crush me, right?
[110:36.97]Down here again, please.
[110:37.97]We're going to get in the toilet and it's going to bring us up.
[110:53.18]Once we get Gordon back, we can really get ambitious.
[110:56.48]Don't you think, Russ?
[110:58.25]Maybe we could take him to the Citadel.
[111:00.57]Well, he saved humanity once.
[111:04.47]And this time he won't have to do it alone.
[111:10.30]No!
[111:10.64]No!
[111:23.95]Itchy nose.
[111:25.23]Itchy nose.
[111:27.43]Itchy nose too.
[111:29.02]Okay.
[111:56.09]Oh, for the explosives.
[112:04.30]Can I kick this down?
[112:09.26]I can't, like, like in that game that everybody references, including me, every single time I play any video game?
[112:16.20]Guess not.
[112:20.23]Uh, I'll take the free heal.
[112:23.83]Not yet.
[112:28.69]Fucking Bugleberry.
[112:30.81]Fuck it.
[113:00.06]Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!
[113:21.95]Oh shit, there's a guy!
[113:25.13]Hold on, take care of this guy first.
[113:28.92]Okay, now, give me that, where'd that go?
[113:33.02]Not in my grenade.
[113:35.02]Okay, come here.
[113:39.17]Oh, I'm so afraid of that smash into the Reddit shelf.
[113:43.13]Where am I?
[113:43.55]Okay, I got it.
[114:31.46]Russ, what do you think they're doing to Gordon Freeman in there?
[114:35.50]That's a good question.
[114:36.88]Are they, you know, sucking his brain out?
[114:41.66]Hey, bitch.
[114:42.04]I think they're going to move him off world.
[114:43.58]Hey, bitch.
[114:44.26]I don't know who they were.
[114:45.50]But thank you, whoever gave you the bunch of money.
[114:48.08]Thank you.
[114:49.96]Thank you.
[115:04.40]Handgun Harry.
[115:15.84]I like the handgun.
[115:16.52]It's like my favorite weapon.
[115:24.12]I have 56 of these.
[115:25.48]I have 56 resin.
[115:28.57]Oh my goodness.
[115:29.19]I can do a lot of stuff now.
[115:30.35]I don't know.
[115:32.19]What should I do though?
[115:41.03]that that's not fair that's not fair how do you get that probably get it later that hurt um
[116:21.02]How do I... How do I do this?
[116:26.37]Quick, do the joke.
[116:30.09]Oh, I know what to do.
[116:36.73]I know what to do.
[116:40.67]Sure.
[116:41.19]Good for you.
[116:50.23]Smart guy.
[116:50.85]Hey smarty.
[116:53.61]Smart guy here.
[116:54.77]Come up here then.
[117:08.69]Not even that scary when you know you can deal with it with a shotgun blast with Jeff.
[117:26.29]Climbing away.
[117:26.81]Get back here.
[117:30.55]Wait, what happened to him?
[117:31.55]What the hell happened to that guy?
[117:32.91]What's the deal with the crowbar?
[117:35.41]Oh, you mean Gordon Freeman's crowbar?
[117:37.89]Yeah.
[117:38.71]Oh.
[117:39.05]Alex, he fought his way out of Black Mesa with nothing but that crowbar.
[117:43.72]In no way.
[117:45.08]True.
[117:45.56]Well, it's true that that's what they say.
[117:47.34]You know, nobody knows for sure.
[117:48.64]Gordon Freeman's crowbar.
[117:50.38]Well, when I get him out, let's give him a gun.
[117:52.90]Yes, not mine.
[117:54.46]I'm out of the gun lending business.
[117:56.00]Dude, I can't wait for it.
[117:57.34]Upgrade station.
[118:00.95]What's that?
[118:12.34]Is that a queen?
[118:20.02]That's fucked up.
[118:22.45]Crazy, okay.
[118:23.03]What am I gonna do?
[118:28.83]What should I do for an upgrade?
[118:40.50]Do the grenade launcher?
[118:43.12]Oh, I don't know, but this is, I don't wanna do this.
[118:49.14]I don't wanna do this.
[118:54.11]I'm only doing this because I'm live.
[118:55.87]If I wasn't live, I would've taken a break here.
[118:57.88]I'll fucking do this another time.
[119:14.86]It's pretty dope.
[119:16.80]Okay, let's see here.
[119:17.90]I wanna take a look.
[119:18.54]I got a lot of red.
[119:19.34]Probably one of the final upgrades I'll do in the game.
[119:25.87]Is there, like, burst fire?
[119:27.79]I don't need it.
[119:30.87]I'm going to save.
[119:33.28]Cave launcher?
[119:34.06]Auto loader?
[119:37.70]I'm going to save.
[119:39.60]Cave launcher.
[119:44.59]Auto loader sounds really good, too.
[119:49.49]But what about my favorite gun?
[119:57.88]Although... The reason I'm doing this is because I always have no place to put grenades.
[120:17.04]So, essentially it's going to store them, right?
[120:23.82]That's a huge amount of resin.
[120:25.18]This is like six hours worth of resin.
[120:34.34]Auto-loader is in use.
[120:43.57]Oh shit.
[120:45.31]Push handle forward to ready grenade launcher?
[120:48.65]Or fire to attack normally?
[120:52.86]Oh shit.
[120:55.12]Press to launch grenade or grab grenade to reset launcher.
[120:58.04]That's the grenade, that's not grenade.
[121:05.00]Okay, it's ready.
[121:10.46]That kinda looks dumb though, doesn't it?
[121:12.28]This is like ugly.
[121:14.52]Alright, what else can I do?
[121:17.07]Careful with this.
[121:22.11]How much is the laser sight for this?
[121:24.11]Reflex is 15.
[121:27.17]I'll wait for 25.
[121:27.97]I want the laser sight.
[121:35.30]Put it up.
[121:43.86]I got my upgrade.
[121:57.71]I'll store it, because I don't need it.
[122:10.59]Oh, people, people, people.
[122:13.84]Is this in the same universe as the movie Wall-E?
[122:15.76]Imagine if that was true.
[122:23.96]Could be.
[122:25.85]It's got the same color scheme as Wall-E.
[122:27.73]It's blue, gray, and white.
[122:29.95]That whole movie is blue, gray, and white, so I see what you mean by that.
[122:42.31]Okay, alright.
[122:43.23]I activated the fight.

[135:37.30]You want to swap in here?
[135:39.14]Yeah, no.
[135:40.28]I would probably die instantly.
[135:42.52]Same shoulder as the arm.
[135:44.51]Oh.
[135:46.25]That's the matter.
[135:46.75]I've done that before.
[135:47.47]Ready?
[135:54.87]But now it's working.
[135:56.03]It works when you don't... It doesn't work when you don't want it to.
[136:01.93]I don't understand.
[136:04.06]You've seen me do the same motions.
[136:06.92]Every time.
[136:11.60]What changed?
[136:12.48]Nothing.
[136:14.32]I can't show it to you.
[136:19.92]Oh!

[137:15.68]This is like the end of the game I got like an hour left in the game or something.
[137:19.76]I Got like one chapter or two chapters left, right?
[137:22.38]I want to make sure I get everything.
[137:23.38]We're just gonna expand
[137:29.82]Alright, nothing.
[137:30.38]Let's go.
[137:32.90]That's the monitor.
[137:42.07]That's my monitor.
[137:45.51]I just hooked it and almost pulled it down.
[138:51.25]Okay.
[138:51.89]There's only one point of entry.
[139:10.94]Wait, do you have to- does it all- does it have to be on- I don't think it has to be on them all at the same time.
[139:16.38]I thought that's what was going on.
[139:18.49]Okay.
[139:19.93]Nope.
[139:20.31]It... It does.
[140:19.09]Uh-oh, yawn!

[140:21.29]Took me five.
[140:23.13]Thank you.
[140:36.97]Podwatcher's already skipped.
[140:38.31]And guess what?
[140:39.74]That's on them.
[140:41.38]Because they sat there probably for that five minutes going, oh, no, no, no, it's going to take them 20 minutes.
[140:46.16]They just went, and ended up, whoa, the final boss, and they just spoiled the whole thing.
[140:50.75]So you know what?
[140:51.75]You did that.
[140:52.39]I didn't.
[140:54.23]I'm just playing the game, breaking and entering.
[140:57.47]What chapter is this?
[141:03.89]Chapter... Chapter we in.
[141:06.49]Chapter 10 out of 11.
[141:08.89]Oh, shit.
[141:09.35]Alright, we're almost done?

[143:19.18]I have too much HP.
[143:30.67]Okay.
[143:37.97]I heard something in there and I'm gonna fuck off real quick.
[143:46.27]Oh boy, okay.
[143:54.71]A lot of shit on you, man.
[143:55.97]I had like 60 bullets on you.
[143:59.13]That's what I'm gonna miss, probably.
[144:12.60]I thought he was alive.
[144:13.32]I thought he was queuing up for an attack.

[154:09.14]I'll see if there are any upgrades I can use.
[154:11.00]Alaska upgrade.
[154:12.90]I was thinking about giving it to Gordon.
[154:16.26]This is the final upgrade of the game.
[154:17.57]I want the red dot sight.
[154:18.65]I want red dot on this.
[154:56.04]It.
[154:57.42]Fuck.
[155:22.63]I- I did it?

[155:45.30]Laser sight.
[155:46.54]Boom.
[155:48.23]Find luck, grade, and life.
[155:56.58]That's it.
[155:56.98]Let's see how good that looks now.
[156:00.87]Now I can finally aim this gun.
[156:02.33]Thank God.
[156:03.45]It only took to the final 20 minutes of the game.
[156:09.19]Hey, whatever.
[156:09.75]Let him sleep.
[156:10.09]Don't wake him up.
[156:26.59]Be careful.
[156:33.66]I love the red dot already.
[156:34.78]Thank God.
[156:44.59]Can we test it?
[156:49.29]So good.
[156:52.73]Oh, it's so good.
[156:55.51]I can actually know what I'm doing.
[156:57.19]It's still resident sleep.
[157:07.21]I mean, I might as well just use it.
[157:11.45]Wake up!
[157:13.27]Wake up!
[157:17.34]Oh, I know why it's on emote-only mode.
[157:19.06]I get it.
[157:20.14]Because everyone was spamming, but they were probably telling me the end of the video game.
[157:26.03]I'm just realizing that now.
[157:27.30]I think it's an emote only because there's going to be a big thing here.
[157:30.36]And everyone's going to be spamming like, Gordon Freeman!
[157:32.94]Gordon Freeman!
[157:34.64]Right?
[157:35.14]I figured it out.
[157:36.10]That's why.
[157:37.23]Alright.
[157:38.45]I get it.
[157:38.75]I get it.
[157:48.20]I think he's behind this door.
[157:49.50]It's going to be Gordon Freeman.
[157:54.78]Hey!
[157:55.12]Three left.
[158:32.28]Ow.
[158:32.58]Oh shit, he had the same idea.
[158:33.36]That it?
[158:33.54]Nothing in the car, okay.
[158:36.54]Oh my god dammit.
[158:37.08]Okay, gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme here we go.
[159:01.43]Direct hit.
[159:01.97]Got him.
[159:04.53]What?
[159:04.71]Come on!
[159:08.06]Oh!
[159:46.87]Fuck outta here!
[159:49.79]I hit every single shot on that guy.
[159:52.48]Every single one.
[160:05.86]It's his bow.
[160:06.32]Okay, we're good.
[160:19.56]Yeah.
[160:21.66]We're gonna need this.
[160:22.54]Oh my goodness.
[160:24.72]Oh my goodness.
[160:25.62]Oh my goodness.
[160:26.38]Wait.
[160:27.72]Now.
[160:33.03]I'll do.
[160:40.02]Don't come in.
[160:40.66]Don't come in.
[160:41.12]Don't come in.
[160:41.58]Don't come in.
[160:42.02]Don't come in.
[160:43.36]I'm warning you.
[160:43.94]Don't come in.
[160:50.39]I tried to tell him.
[160:56.29]Fuck.
[161:07.00]Fuck.
[161:08.00]I'm dead, man.
[161:08.78]I'm dead.
[161:09.92]Healing station.
[161:16.82]Do it.
[161:21.02]Gordon's going to be behind that door.
[161:22.30]That was a full heal.
[161:26.77]I think it's the only time in the whole game I've done a full heal.
[161:28.75]Let's take a second here.
[161:30.63]Alright.
[161:41.09]What else we got?
[161:41.97]Nothing else?
[161:43.33]What are we doing on ammo?
[161:48.53]Good.
[161:51.14]Good.
[161:52.78]Full.
[161:53.22]Everything's full.
[161:53.82]Full health, full ammo.
[161:54.84]We're good.
[161:55.18]Let's move.
[161:55.50]You have the stuff over here.
[162:11.07]I think so.
[162:14.31]Alright.
[162:16.89]Still in emote only.
[162:18.13]Holy shit.
[162:18.73]That means something big must be about to happen.
[162:22.31]I'm huge.
[162:30.14]Open.
[162:33.38]You fucking stink.
[162:34.86]Ain't nothing even in here.
[162:40.88]Okay, is Gordon going to open this door and does he talk?
[162:45.82]Alex, so good to see you.
[162:47.59]My name's Gordon.
[162:49.43]You know, I hope they do that.
[162:50.87]I hope he talks.
[163:01.92]Freezing up on our ass.
[163:07.76]That would be an oh shit moment, I'll tell you that.
[163:16.51]What's that?
[163:25.01]Are you... What are you fucking toys?
[163:31.75]Let's go.
[164:01.87]They go all the way up to the top of the tower?
[164:04.75]Oh, we're gonna get attacked by the drones now.
[164:10.34]This is great.
[164:11.04]Okay.
[164:11.50]Just slowly go through this.
[164:12.68]Out of here.
[164:35.23]How do I get up here?
[164:36.47]Oh, shit.
[164:37.01]Okay, I'm gonna jump.
[164:40.31]There.
[164:40.99]Over here.
[164:45.21]Up here.
[164:46.67]Up there.
[164:53.80]Don't fall.
[164:54.42]Don't fall!
[164:55.98]Oh, you lucky bastard.
[164:57.54]Three left.
[165:00.26]Last one.
[165:18.54]Still emote only?
[165:20.52]Oh, fuck.
[165:22.54]Your G-Man's going to be on the top of this tower naked by the amount of how long emote only mode has been on.
[165:30.26]Hello, Gordon Freeman.
[165:32.30]Hey.
[165:35.59]I'm sorry.
[165:47.41]Holy shit.
[165:48.51]Yeah.
[165:54.89]He put his hand down.
[166:00.17]Yeah.
[166:00.73]Oh, hello, Mr. Freeman.
[166:07.81]It's me, G-Man.
[166:08.79]And by the way, G-Man is Gordon Freeman.
[166:11.67]I see it.
[166:12.61]We're almost there.
[166:24.70]I'm ready.
[166:25.06]I don't need it yet.
[166:46.75]Oh, he hid behind the force field.
[166:48.05]Cheater.
[166:56.87]Another one.
[166:58.45]Another guy.
[167:00.00]I hear a loud sound.
[167:00.88]I think it's a big guy.
[167:02.30]It's a big guy.
[167:02.76]It's a big guy.
[167:03.18]Huge guy.
[167:04.14]Big guy coming in.
[167:09.20]Who's the big guy now?
[167:24.65]You fucking vampire, there's only one way you can kill these son of a bitches.
[167:40.01]Did I get the final electricity puzzle?
[167:53.26]We're like 12 hours into the game.
[167:55.40]You're gonna put like the wood in front of the door still?
[167:58.86]You're still gonna put the wood in front of the door?
[168:06.80]Alex, you there?
[168:07.84]Yeah, Dad.
[168:08.91]It looks like you will be able to get into the vault from up there.
[168:11.79]There's a terminal that extends the bridge to the entrance.
[168:14.67]What's the security like inside?
[168:15.97]I got it all laid out in front of me and I'll tell you.
[168:19.09]There is security.
[168:20.51]But I've never seen anything like it.
[168:22.60]It doesn't make any sense.
[168:24.34]I guess I'll have to improvise.
[168:26.48]Don't worry, honey.
[168:27.80]I'll figure it out.
[168:29.37]It's kind of satisfying when you pull the things off.
[168:44.07]We're like going way, way up here.
[168:59.00]Alex, dead ahead.
[168:59.84]Those controls docked the vault to the station.
[169:04.64]Mike, I've came to the inside of a piano.
[169:08.55]What should I do?
[169:09.13]Alright.
[169:14.15]Here we go.
[169:14.47]Time to go rescue the savior of humanity.
[169:18.83]You know, honey, you haven't been doing too bad yourself.
[169:22.19]Earth could have used you in the Seven-Eleven War.
[169:24.75]Maybe we'd have laced it.
[169:27.69]Alright, looks like the bridge is fully extended.
[169:31.32]Just need to gently dock the vault to the bridge.
[169:35.32]How far can that be?
[169:36.24]How do you do that?
[169:38.70]Okay, well, one of these has to bring in the vault for docking, right?
[169:42.80]Right?
[169:43.08]Almost certainly.
[169:45.22]Just pick one.
[169:46.47]Immediately.
[169:47.49]Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[169:49.33]Okay, we're gonna do term on nine.
[169:51.77]Maybe.
[169:53.57]No, not that one.
[169:54.83]Eight.
[169:57.32]Got it.
[170:34.06]here he comes here he comes here he comes here he comes oh it's not it's a loading screen that was crazy though
[171:10.14]L-U-L.
[171:10.70]Alright, here we go.
[171:11.90]Here it comes.
[171:12.34]Jesus Christ.
[171:16.52]What is that thing?
[171:18.24]Why is there a stretch Armstrong that's stretched way too much?
[171:42.12]Holy shit, I'm dead.
[171:46.14]Fuck.
[171:47.36]Reload the safe.
[171:48.06]Reload the safe.
[171:48.88]Reload the safe.
[171:51.40]Reload the safe.
[171:53.65]Reload, please.
[172:00.95]Reload the safe.
[172:05.84]I don't want to waste that.
[172:06.68]I'm probably going to need it.
[172:15.35]What?
[172:17.17]Why is everybody doing that?
[172:20.79]This is like a checkpoint.
[172:25.72]Yeah, see?
[172:26.16]You guys don't freak me out.
[172:30.20]Alex, are you okay?
[172:33.18]I think I just killed Gordon Freeman.
[172:35.38]The vault's right there.
[172:36.38]Just go in and get him.
[172:38.04]That's what they look like up close.
[172:39.62]I'm on my way.
[172:53.13]Healing station.
[172:53.96]Yeah, I wasted my injection.
[172:59.74]I didn't even need to use it.
[173:01.46]And here it comes.
[173:06.28]Here it comes.
[173:07.44]Where is he?
[173:30.48]Mm.
[173:31.95]Mm.
[173:32.05]Make sure we're all loaded up.
[173:39.01]I'm ready.
[173:52.24]Even deeper.
[173:52.92]Look at Earth's core.
[174:21.50]That's that.
[174:24.20]Damage assessment shot 15 times in the face and chest.
[174:30.03]Oh.
[174:31.19]That's not what happened.
[175:11.57]Full ammo.
[175:13.56]Okay, we're even deeper now.
[175:43.49]I thought that was Gordon Freeman for a second.
[175:45.31]I was like, well, there he is.
[175:46.28]I don't know.
[175:52.06]I don't know.
[175:54.36]Fuck!
[175:54.84]I just showed him a firework.
[175:56.18]God damn it.
[176:07.81]Out of cells.
[176:14.00]Strider.
[176:14.38]Ooh, extra ammo.
[176:15.10]Alright, what are we trying to do here?
[176:46.52]in that room somewhere apparently broken the lift is up okay let's keep going sneak in there crawl
[177:32.31]Give it to me!
[177:32.81]Okay, I got it.
[177:35.35]Wait, no, I have to prop up the door.
[177:36.77]Alright, I gotta prop it up.
[177:40.50]Made it.
[177:56.58]More of this shit.
[177:57.60]Okay.
[178:01.85]Power up there.
[178:02.55]Up.
[178:02.90]Uh-huh.
[178:03.58]Uh-huh.
[178:04.08]Hey.
[178:35.92]Power's on here.
[178:36.66]Another power cell activator.
[178:46.91]This one goes... Hold it.
[178:53.09]Power on.
[179:00.29]Oh, more trails.
[179:02.59]Okay, now the lift works.
[179:06.31]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[179:07.47]Look at this.
[179:11.03]I almost missed this shit.
[179:12.27]Um... Take it.
[179:13.71]One left.
[179:21.94]Oh.
[179:25.96]There's a left.
[179:29.99]Alex, it's the Strider!
[179:31.33]Look out!
[179:31.73]It's alive!
[179:32.79]What?
[179:32.95]The fuck?
[179:39.26]Did I kill this thing?
[179:39.86]Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me!
[180:12.70]Oh, fuck that.
[180:15.01]Fuck that.
[180:15.88]Um...
[180:52.35]Holy shit, that was insane.
[180:55.64]Okay.
[180:57.44]I didn't even use anything.
[180:59.86]How much health do I have?
[181:01.60]I'm alright.
[181:30.97]Oh, shit!
[181:31.33]There's a person!
[181:32.25]Oh, fuck!
[181:32.71]Get away from me!
[181:45.76]Get away from me!
[181:46.64]Get away from me!
[182:00.91]I didn't know we were going to be right there.
[182:03.76]Shit.
[182:03.94]This game is insane.
[182:08.38]It's just, it's like, it's, it's, it's stimulation.
[182:10.58]Just stimulation.
[182:13.00]Explosion.
[182:13.76]Guy coming, a giant alien.
[182:15.30]Shoot those guys.
[182:16.08]Watch out.
[182:16.48]Watch out for the guys.
[182:17.01]It's an alien.
[182:18.53]Oh, this is nuts.
[182:22.25]I feel like I downloaded into my brain every scary haunted house I've ever been into and every theme park ride I've ever been on at the same time.
[182:30.69]This is like going down the apex of the Superman ride of steel while somebody is putting screamers into your face.
[182:39.90]It's just a huge amount of intense reaction.
[182:42.44]Okay, hold on.
[182:42.98]And let's go.
[183:07.82]Can I unplug something?
[183:22.01]Oh shit!
[183:22.53]The power cable!
[183:24.19]I unplugged the power cable!
[183:28.21]And the USB!
[183:42.30]What happened to my arm?
[183:43.88]What?
[183:44.62]What?
[183:45.72]What happened?
[184:12.32]What happened?
[184:13.14]What happened?
[184:51.18]Fuck you!
[184:52.58]Fuck you!
[185:25.13]I lost chat.
[185:46.09]I don't have chat anymore.
[185:50.41]I gotta do it without chat!
[185:53.43]When I rip down the cable, I have nothing anymore.
[185:58.01]We gotta do it without chat.
[186:00.13]Without chat's encouragement.
[186:02.79]Okay, let's go.
[186:03.39]I got a shitload of errors on my computer right now.
[186:11.30]I'm not even gonna open them.
[186:14.48]Okay, let's go.
[186:15.12]Oh, I'm gonna need a bath after this one.
[186:52.17]This control is broken too.
[187:11.02]This control is broken too.
[187:14.62]They're both broken.
[187:27.92]I can't move!
[187:29.22]I can't move!
[187:37.91]I got the teleporter on, I can't move!
[188:05.13]I can't walk!
[188:15.20]Perfect, bro!
[188:31.14]Walk!
[188:31.70]Please walk!
[188:33.38]Please walk!
[189:03.38]I'm freezing, I already- I gotta slowly get my, like, broken body to the end of the game.
[189:15.42]Oh shit, move!
[189:16.76]This way, this way, this way, come on, come on, slow, slow, you got it.
[189:38.61]Oh my god, I'm in a lot of trouble!
[189:40.17]Wait, there's- I see chat!
[189:51.07]I see chat, I just turned the controller really fucked up like this.
[189:55.70]Restart the game?
[189:58.38]Why?
[189:59.18]What happened?
[190:00.90]Restart the game, why?
[190:01.80]I need to restart.
[190:08.90]We're just controllers.
[190:10.68]Yeah, I know.
[190:11.22]But this is alright.
[190:15.03]I got it.
[190:15.31]Don't worry.
[190:15.65]I got it.
[190:22.21]Take a second to reload.
[190:51.89]God, why?
[190:52.59]Okay, if I do it really lightly, it works.
[191:08.51]Car.
[191:17.28]Over there, right?
[191:22.73]I'm gonna take it with me.
[191:29.39]Peace for the love of God, open.
[191:38.61]Um... I don't know, should I just... Should I- I'm just gonna- I gotta leave it!
[191:43.94]I have to leave it!
[191:52.84]Okay, here we go.
[192:06.67]Thank God!
[192:08.67]Where do I go?
[192:09.53]Oh no fucking way, dude.
[192:23.44]Just fucking... I don't want it anymore.
[192:25.18]It's a pain in the ass.
[193:12.12]Russell, big gun, up ahead.
[193:14.36]Wow!
[193:14.74]I think I've got an idea.
[193:16.48]I just had it, too.
[193:17.98]It's a good one.
[193:19.56]Get out, get out, get out, get out.
[193:21.28]Oh, my God.
[193:22.02]Come on, take it, take it, take it.
[193:25.74]Oh, shit, right here.
[193:27.67]Oh, my fucking God.
[193:29.25]Oh, my God.
[193:30.47]Don't kill me, please.
[193:33.31]Don't kill me, I ask nicely.
[193:48.67]What the fuck?
[193:49.87]I didn't even get to use it!
[193:52.68]I didn't even get to use it!
[194:25.90]What do I do?
[194:27.49]Do I touch that?
[194:28.17]I don't know.
[195:54.17]What the fuck is that?
[195:56.91]Did I hit the enrage timer?
[196:01.35]Oh my back is killing me right now.
[196:04.57]This whole area is gonna be inflamed.
[196:08.89]I hit the enrage timer, dude.
[196:13.57]I'm gonna have to go on one of those medieval devices that stretch you out and rip your bones in half.
[196:20.60]Fuck me.
[196:26.11]Alright, no more three VR days in a row.
[196:29.17]I can't do that again.
[196:31.39]Let's go!
[196:38.78]Like, this is the type of shit that, like, come on!
[197:33.27]Yeah, we did it.
[197:36.67]We did it.
[197:38.27]What's going on here?
[197:54.29]Jump?
[197:54.71]How do I get over there?
[198:07.68]What the fuck is happening?
[198:11.39]Wait, wait, wait, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[198:13.39]Oh shit, maybe I should have done that.
[198:16.01]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[198:34.73]Whoa.
[198:35.17]Yeah, okay.
[198:37.07]Hold up.
[198:37.99]Ah.
[198:38.35]The guns!
[198:38.65]You're throwing off a lot of interference.
[198:40.13]I might not be able to talk to you in there.
[198:42.45]No, probably not.
[198:43.94]So, uh, this is it?
[198:46.54]Yeah.
[198:47.26]And then you'll come out with Gordon to take him down, so everything is gonna be... Everything will be fine, Russ.
[198:54.04]Talk to you soon.
[198:56.07]What?
[198:56.83]Why?
[199:08.56]Uh-oh.
[199:10.92]Um.
[199:10.98]Not good.
[199:15.77]What the heck's going on here?
[199:19.47]Alright, let's get a mid-roll add right when I fucking press right trigger.
[199:30.38]Holy shit, dude.
[199:31.18]No way.
[199:32.82]It's Gordon.
[199:33.62]Applebee's has 25 ribs for $25! $25!
[199:40.78]Okay, this is weird.
[199:42.65]I don't know, it doesn't look too dangerous.
[199:45.83]Okay.
[199:50.61]Whole world's floating around.
[200:03.80]Hey.
[200:04.08]Am I in a dream?
[200:07.52]It's like a dream world.
[200:17.09]But don't open it.
[200:17.81]Excuse me.
[200:24.17]Excuse me.
[200:26.21]Oh, dude, yeah, get a banana and spin it around into space!
[200:30.71]Oh!
[200:32.16]I did that, like, right into the camera, didn't I?
[200:48.98]I got his brief- This is a G-Man's briefcase!
[200:52.84]What's in it?
[200:59.61]Oh, this- Nevermind.
[201:19.43]Okay.
[201:19.61]I don't hear a clock.
[201:21.73]I guess I hear like a .
[201:23.47]I don't have any weapons or anything.
[201:47.67]I swear to God.
[201:50.76]If Peter Molyneux is inside of there, I'm going to be really mad.
[202:39.40]Alright, final opportunity for a television joke.
[202:42.14]Oh my god, final opportunity for a television joke.
[202:44.06]Final opportunity for a television joke.
[202:45.98]I don't even care.
[202:47.20]Fuck the TV joke.
[202:49.16]Fuck the TV joke.
[202:50.55]Never doing a TV joke again.
[203:33.60]This is some Inception-level shit right now.
[203:35.78]Okay.
[203:35.98]What happens if I fall off?
[204:02.99]Bonkers.
[204:04.61]I almost just fell off.
[204:05.67]I did fall off.
[204:06.21]I did.
[204:06.60]Yeah, I fell off.
[204:07.56]I fell off.
[204:16.60]I'm dead.
[204:16.92]I'm at life.
[204:23.57]I softlocked myself?
[204:26.59]I softlocked?
[204:34.36]Oh, no, I'm not.
[204:45.01]Mailroom?
[204:45.89]Okay, um... Open... Like a... Then go in.
[204:54.55]Okay.
[205:02.63]If you want to do something weird...
[205:05.08]Take a mirror that's long enough for you to hold up against your chin.
[205:08.41]And if you hold a mirror long ways like this, flat so the mirror is facing up, and you walk around, it actually looks like this.
[205:17.15]You're walking around on your... Be careful, though, because you'll bump into shit.
[205:25.16]But it's really, really weird.
[205:26.26]It does the same exact thing in real life.
[205:30.03]That was like in Nickelodeon magazine like 25 years ago, I remember reading Nickelodeon magazine Whose house are we in who is this person?
[205:51.88]I
[205:59.23]Oh, crack the plates and smash the plates.
[206:01.69]That's what Bilbo Baggins hates.
[206:03.96]Crack the plates and smash the plates.
[206:05.76]So carefully, carefully with the plates.
[206:09.20]Oh, don't do that.
[206:10.56]Watch out for that.
[206:12.38]Oh, you idiot.
[206:13.92]Oh, come on.
[206:39.29]That hurt.
[206:41.31]That hurt.
[206:42.39]That fucking hurt.
[206:48.40]Jesus, man.
[206:51.36]This is not open.
[207:09.18]Am I stuck in the bathroom?
[207:15.57]Why am I stuck in the bathroom?
[207:25.95]Oh, it was just open.
[207:27.40]I don't have any weapons.
[207:39.17]What am I supposed to do about this?
[207:53.26]Oh my god, was that a drink?
[207:54.40]Was that a drink?
[207:54.88]No, thank goodness it wasn't a fucking drink.
[208:18.50]It's dripping.
[208:19.62]This is too much.
[208:22.27]This is too much for my brain.
[208:24.43]I'm going to go down there.
[208:26.29]My brain's going to explode.
[208:31.01]Get me in there, please.
[208:33.47]Bathroom.
[208:33.95]Another bathroom.
[208:35.11]I love the bathrooms.
[208:45.37]I'm doomed.
[209:00.82]What is going on right now?
[209:03.70]What is this level?
[209:05.67]Am I inside of the machine?
[209:07.19]I don't understand.
[209:09.23]Okay, we're going here.
[209:27.40]Or don't open it.
[209:29.48]Do I have to go in that one?
[209:30.64]I don't have to go in that door, do I?
[209:39.05]How the fuck am I gonna get up there?
[209:49.66]Um...
[209:59.15]I got the right idea, I think.
[210:11.30]Up on there.
[210:20.73]Do I have the right idea?
[210:29.57]Can I jump on that?
[210:33.11]No!
[210:33.59]Nay, nay, nay.
[210:35.01]Nay, nay, nay, nay.
[210:36.17]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright!
[210:40.00]Which one opens?

[210:54.13]This one doesn't open.
[211:03.67]What the fuck am I supposed to do?
[211:10.42]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[211:11.94]What?
[211:12.32]I can't get in here.
[211:32.92]What the fuck?
[211:41.59]I feel like this is what I have to do!
[211:43.25]Fuck!
[211:47.31]Oh my god!
[211:49.97]Fucking VR, man!
[211:52.17]Just lock me in a cube!
[211:54.41]In a padded room!
[211:57.85]Oh, this is not right?
[212:20.74]Ow!
[212:22.38]Wait, I died?
[212:23.32]How did I die?
[212:30.93]I got hit in the head by a fucking sofa?
[212:33.73]I guess it was just like... Fuck!
[212:44.54]Okay, at least I have the right idea.
[212:46.14]Alright, that's the right idea.
[212:50.42]I had it right.
[212:51.72]Boom.
[213:05.08]Okay, just wait till it sucks all the furniture out of the room.
[213:08.79]There's the door.
[213:40.64]What?
[213:42.26]Get that door open!
[213:49.04]Oh shit!
[213:55.00]Hey!
[214:03.55]I just gotta go over there.
[214:14.39]I have powers Dude I don't know I have no idea what I'm doing right now, but I can't help it.

[215:33.57]Oh, this is a bigger toilet paper.
[215:40.27]Excuse me.
[216:01.59]What's next?
[216:06.48]Oh, you don't think I can get in this door?
[216:08.06]Power up!
[216:08.64]Power up!
[216:10.54]Power up!
[216:49.22]I'm bored in here.
[216:58.45]What's going on?
[216:59.73]Oh my god.
[217:05.50]Wait, I need... Give me more of those.
[217:06.66]I don't have any more of those.
[217:07.93]What do I have?
[217:09.85]Holy shit.
[217:10.99]Okay.
[217:13.53]He shot the grenade in my mouth.
[217:16.59]What happened to it?
[217:31.96]Okay.
[217:40.00]Anybody else think they should make these controls out of fucking taffy or something?
[217:42.78]Why are they made out of plastic?
[217:44.16]They should be made out of stainless steel.
[218:01.13]Why are these made out of plastic?
[218:10.09]Oh, they're gonna get... Fuck you, buddy.
[218:53.06]What do we say?
[218:56.64]Power!
[218:57.42]Alright, look, there's no more power.
[219:20.23]Win?
[219:37.24]Gordon, I'm here to save you.
[219:38.34]Gordon, I'm here to save you.
[219:39.88]Gordon, I'm here to rescue you.
[219:50.92]It's me, Alex Vance.
[220:21.25]Yo, this is the end.
[220:53.34]Wait, we just released G-Man.
[220:55.08]That's what's going on.
[220:55.84]We're releasing G-Man.
[220:58.46]Combine had this motherfucker trapped.
[221:00.82]We just let him out.
[221:01.72]That's G-Man.
[221:02.34]That's not Gordon Freeman.
[221:04.19]We're the bad guys.
[221:04.91]Holy shit.
[221:07.59]This changes everything.
[221:09.33]This changes the whole story.
[221:11.69]Alright, Gordon.
[221:14.31]Let's get you out of this thing.
[221:15.63]This changes literally the entire story.
[221:18.11]Holy shit.
[221:20.93]Okay.
[221:24.31]Alright, I'm ready.
[221:30.78]Uncle Fester's vibration machine on maximum.
[221:35.66]I told you, I told you.
[221:38.27]Told you.
[221:47.70]We let that fucking guy out.
[221:50.81]Impressive work, Ms.
[221:53.32]Vance.
[221:55.32]Gordon Freeman?
[221:59.30]Gordon Freeman?
[222:04.02]Ms.
[222:04.28]Vance, you wouldn't need all that to imprison Gordon Freeman.
[222:13.25]So, who are you?
[222:17.60]Perhaps what I am is not as important as what I can offer you in exchange for coming to hell this way.
[222:31.10]Some believe the fate of our worlds is inflexible.
[222:37.64]My employers disagree.
[222:42.30]They authorize me to nudge things in a particular direction from time to time.
[222:53.48]What would you want nudged, Ms.
[222:57.92]Vance?
[222:59.60]The Combine off Earth.
[223:02.58]I want the Combine off Earth.
[223:05.85]Ah, that would be a considerably large nudge.
[223:12.27]Briefcase.
[223:45.97]Dad?
[223:47.39]What?
[223:49.59]Is that me?
[223:51.82]What is this?
[223:53.70]What's happening?
[223:54.52]We are in the future.
[223:57.44]This is the moment where you watch your father die.
[224:05.66]Unless... What?
[224:09.04]Unless what?
[224:10.94]Unless you were to take matters into your own hands.
[224:18.56]Hey, I... Oh.
[224:28.24]Release your father.
[224:30.44]What?
[224:30.66]This is a trick.
[224:34.56]You're already tricked.
[224:35.40]This is a trick.
[224:44.42]Good.
[224:45.98]As a consequence of your action, this entity will continue.
[224:52.86]And this entity will not.
[224:56.74]Right.
[224:57.82]So he's okay, right?
[225:00.55]He lives.
[225:02.31]My dad lives.
[225:03.97]You are aware that you've proven yourself to be of extraordinary value.
[225:12.69]The previous hire has been unable or unwilling to perform the tasks laid before him.
[225:23.26]We have struggled to find a suitable replacement until now.
[225:32.92]No!
[225:34.94]I just want to go home.
[225:37.05]Send me home!
[225:38.07]I'm afraid you misunderstand the situation, Mrs. Wait!
[225:46.72]Hey, wait!
[225:47.66]Wait!
[225:48.74]What happened?
[225:52.04]Wait!
[225:52.20]What?
[225:52.30]Okay, so... Subject, Alex Vance.
[225:56.20]Has... Tired.
[225:57.66]Waiting... Assignment.
[226:03.05]I thought he... Doesn't Eli Vance die?
[226:05.17]What happened?
[226:11.38]Hold on a second.
[226:11.88]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[226:13.06]So, did we just, like, stop that from happening?
[226:15.32]But it happens.
[226:16.30]Because this takes place before Half-Life 2.
[226:17.88]What the fuck happened?
[226:20.19]Wait, what?
[226:20.67]Are we in, like, a different, like, time?
[226:23.43]Are we in, like, a multiverse?
[226:26.61]Keep watching, okay?
[226:27.85]That was awesome.
[226:28.51]That last 45 minutes was in-fucking-sane.
[226:41.26]Okay, let me tell you something.
[226:42.82]If you had... If you had...
[226:47.36]Like a gigantic living room.
[226:50.09]And like five lighthouses.
[226:52.63]And you had an index.
[226:54.29]And you had the knuckle controllers.
[226:57.39]Yeah, that last sequence would have been the most intense moment of your whole life.
[227:01.41]If you were able to actually sprint around your living room, you gotta be careful though.
[227:05.07]Because you could like literally sprint, sprint, sprint and smash Looney Tunes style into your wall and go right through it and leave an imprint.
[227:14.04]He'll be like, boom, through the door with the thing that looks like this.
[227:16.64]Like, oh, look, it's a person's body went through here.
[227:19.48]That was fucking crazy.
[227:24.12]There he is.
[227:24.66]There he is.
[227:25.22]There he is.
[227:25.78]There he is.
[227:26.36]There he is.
[227:26.84]You guys glad Robin Walker worked on another FPS?
[227:31.61]I am.
[227:32.85]Oh, that was great.
[227:38.81]That was very good.
[227:42.01]Oh, WB Game Audio, Warner Brothers?
[227:44.88]I don't think that's who that is.
[227:51.31]Yeah, it's the same G-Man, yeah.
[227:53.93]And those of you that know, that G-Man is the spy.
[227:58.03]He's also a very talented actor.
[228:01.26]Probably can't hear a word I'm saying.
[228:03.26]The music's going very loud.
[228:17.70]And is it after credit scene?
[228:20.68]Warning.
[228:21.76]Vital signs critical.
[228:23.70]Seek medical attention.
[228:29.28]Gordon.
[228:30.81]Gordon.
[228:32.65]Wake up, Gordon.
[228:34.09]She's gone, Gordon.
[228:35.81]She's gone.
[228:37.05]Son of a bitch and his unforeseen consequences.
[228:40.23]I knew it.
[228:41.75]Don't do this to me.
[228:43.03]Don't let me pick this up and then go back.
[228:56.24]Oh, you're going to end the game now.
[229:00.94]No.
[229:18.09]I got to touch it.
[229:23.51]Okay, so... Eli Vance is alive.
[229:27.57]That was the very... Those of you that have no idea.
[229:30.37]It's been like 15 years.
[229:33.33]So Eli Vance dies at the end of Half-Life 2.
[229:36.11]Episode 2.
[229:38.79]That's where it's left off.
[229:41.57]This game... Where are you guys?
[229:46.77]Spoilers.
[229:51.47]You just watched him die on the ground.
[229:54.01]This is the third Half-Life game.
[229:57.99]What are you doing here?
[230:01.82]Anyways, so let me get this straight.
[230:06.48]Eli Vance dies at the end of Half-Life 2 Episode 2.
[230:10.86]This game takes place before Half-Life 2.
[230:13.34]This is in between Half-Life 1 and Half-Life 2.
[230:17.50]But so if that's the case, when you play Half-Life 2, he dies in that game.
[230:22.93]It's not like, you know, it would be really fucking crazy.
[230:25.59]It would be crazy.
[230:26.79]Val, are you listening?
[230:27.77]How crazy would this be?
[230:28.87]If they patched Half-Life 2 Episode 2 and he don't fucking die now.
[230:32.57]What a mindfuck that would be.
[230:33.75]Imagine they patched that shit.
[230:43.81]It was like Alex Vance went back and then messed with the timeline, and it messed with your computer?
[230:51.00]Awesome.
[230:52.04]That's cool, but how does that work?
[231:03.28]It's retconned.
[231:03.94]But Half-Life 2 Episode 2 still happens.
[231:14.84]That means it's time travel.
[231:16.86]But that also means that somebody fucks up later in, like, Half-Life 4, which causes him to die anyways in Half-Life 2 Episode 2.
[231:26.20]Well, they've got a real can of worms to play with here.
[231:30.54]Whenever they do that.
[231:31.34]Wrong?
[231:40.30]Completely wrong.
[231:43.66]Happens
[231:46.15]Is a time traveler Half-Life 2 never happened Half-Life 2 never happened.
[231:55.71]Oh, but that but right there that was Okay, I'm gonna I'm gonna have to go through quite a few reddit threads after the stream ends I'm gonna have to watch Half-Life: Alyx broken down
[232:12.95]It's all fiction.
[232:15.17]Reddit theory.
[232:16.31]Alright, let me get out of here.
[232:19.71]That was awesome.
[232:20.30]Alright, I'm going to have to give it an official score.
[232:29.62]An official score.
[232:30.68]My camera's lagging again.
[232:38.32]Definitely higher than an 8.
[232:43.84]Definitely higher than a 9.
[232:44.48]Definitely higher than a 92.
[233:04.18]Higher than a 92.
[233:16.07]It's 94.
[233:16.19]Done.
[233:16.35]9.4.
[233:16.37]Done.
[233:18.27]It's 94.
[233:18.39]Fantastic.
[233:20.55]I'll tell you.
[233:28.07]A little bit of the drop issues over the shoulder I had.
[233:38.12]That's one little millipoint.
[233:40.68]Two millipoints.
[233:42.54]And...
[233:44.55]electricity kind of mini game thing where you switch the wires I mean there's a little a lot of those 9.4 that was your fault end user problem alright fine we'll add two points but then I I take an extra two million points off for all the electricity puzzles there you go it's 9.4
[234:11.63]Literally, like, the highest score I've given a game in, like, four years.
[234:19.71]Just say 10.
[234:22.93]When was the last time I gave a game higher than a 9?
[234:24.59]I gave, uh... I gave Outer Wilds an 8.9, an 89, and people, like, wanted to kill me.
[234:40.21]House Flipper VR.
[234:41.31]Yeah, we'll do that.
[234:42.96]That's the 22nd, right?
[234:45.58]I still do.
[234:49.92]Now that was awesome.
[234:50.98]That was very, very, very good.
[234:52.16]That exceeded my expectations.
[234:54.24]I didn't have any expectations.
[234:55.47]I told you, I'm not doing that anymore.
[234:57.43]I'm not giving games expectations anymore.
[235:00.23]Because if I was going to be sitting here looking up shit every single day about Half-Life Alyx like I would have done, I'm not putting games on pedestals anymore.
[235:09.08]I'm just going to let them play.
[235:11.93]I didn't look up anything.
[235:13.15]I didn't even care about this game.
[235:16.21]This is like three and a half months late.
[235:17.71]Four and a half months late playing this?
[235:20.09]I just said, you know what?
[235:22.40]It's going to wow me if it does.
[235:24.40]I'm not going to look up anything.
[235:25.70]I don't want to put it up higher because if I put it too high, then it's not good enough.
[235:28.64]It was great.
[235:32.80]It was six months.
[235:33.66]Yeah, pretty late.
[235:37.86]Seven months late.
[235:38.62]Whatever.
[235:39.30]Same deal.
[235:40.24]It's within 12 months.
[235:41.26]It's okay.
[235:43.68]I'll play Boneworks.
[235:44.58]That's the plan.
[235:45.40]But.
[235:49.43]We're going to move away from VR for a little while.
[235:51.51]I want my hair to grow back.
[235:53.59]I want my hair to grow back bad.
[235:56.85]We've been doing tons of VR.
[235:59.05]We're going to move away from VR for a couple of weeks.
[236:01.38]We're going to go back to playing a video game.
[236:03.98]It's not in a headset.
[236:06.80]I want to play Saw 2.
[236:07.72]Got to do Chubby Bunny.
[236:10.12]Chubby Bunny.
[236:13.41]We still have a bunch of 3DO stuff that has to be done.
[236:17.99]We'll go back to VR when we get close to Halloween.
[236:21.31]Because then I have like three or four scary games.
[236:24.48]We'll do like a Halloween VR week where I play scary shit.
[236:27.66]Sounds like a plan.
[236:35.49]Alright, here's the ultimate question though.
[236:38.07]Is Half-Life Alyx worth getting a VR headset?
[236:46.13]a lot of money that's it's a shitload of money I would say yes if there was realistically even like one or two other games that with at this caliber if you buy a vr headset for Alex you're gonna be really fucking disappointed because every single other game you play on vr is way worse
[237:14.68]So, I would wait till there was another couple of these before you dish out four, five, six, seven hundred bucks.
[237:24.50]Now, just because they're, I mean, look, that you don't have like Valve behind you making your game.
[237:29.30]Well, let's be honest, any VR game that is out now, I mean, you can't really compare.
[237:34.29]You just can't.
[237:36.01]That doesn't mean they're not fun.
[237:41.51]And, yeah, the PC required to do so.
[237:43.21]But, ah, hold on a second, though.
[237:44.45]Hold on.
[237:46.49]My PC's really not that good.
[237:49.11]Like, it is, but it's not.
[237:51.05]I have a 1080 and an i7, like, 6800.
[237:56.62]So... I have, like, 5- or 6-year-old hardware, and it still ran it fine.
[238:01.54]780 can run it?
[238:08.70]Probably, yeah.
[238:09.40]I mean, I didn't see very much slowdown.
[238:11.00]And remember, I'm streaming this, too.
[238:13.40]So essentially, like, this is going through twice.
[238:16.20]Like, my CPU is running double time because it's, like, encoding all the VR shit.
[238:24.89]Source 2.
[238:25.23]Source 2 is pretty optimized, yeah.
[238:29.90]My 1050 ran at 5 with no problems.
[238:31.60]Yeah, you don't need, like, super crazy hardware.
[238:38.00]And it is still a high tier.
[238:40.67]I still think it's pretty good.
[238:41.65]I think it's done pretty good for me.
[238:46.77]Alright.
[238:48.05]Let's do a hair check and then I'm going to get out of here.
[238:51.77]Pretty bad.
[238:55.89]And it is good enough right now.
[238:57.25]It's four and a half years old.
[238:58.27]Yeah, it's still good.
[238:59.71]Let's see.
[239:06.31]It actually looks kind of styled.
[239:13.73]Elvis.
[239:14.75]What am I doing?
[239:15.31]Uh-huh.
[239:16.21]Ooh.
[239:18.45]That's like bargain bin Elvis.
[239:20.89]Whoa.
[239:21.93]Look at that.
[239:25.05]I'm one of those angler fishes.
[239:27.33]You know, like the big teeth?
[239:29.53]And like the light bulb?
[239:37.64]Alright.
[239:37.94]I gotta get out of here.
[239:39.20]I gotta fuck off.
[239:41.92]uh let's take a look and see what happened over the course of the stream let's do let's get the credits rolling thanks for watching everybody Half-Life: Alyx awesome 9.4 out of 10. wow thanks for stopping everybody speaking of which we had five community subs from prono varrox thank you five community subs from nukeable I think we got that already fifty dollars that I missed this somebody said big bits
[240:11.60]And here they are.
[240:13.92]Uh, when I was in the headset, I couldn't really see.
[240:17.16]Uh, PriproPrap, thanks for the $50.
[240:19.50]A large amount of money.
[240:23.54]You are by far the most enjoyable streamer to watch, and I've been watching your videos for about eight years.
[240:27.95]Can't afford to give you the amount of bits I would want to for entertaining me for years.
[240:31.55]Thanks for being you and doing what you do.
[240:33.39]If I ever have children, I'm going to make them watch your videos to learn how to be funny, as I couldn't educate them better on that myself.
[240:39.83]If you, uh, show your children my videos, they're gonna end up in detention.
[240:43.63]Over and over again.
[240:45.05]I would hold off on that until they are at least, probably, at least until they're 18.
[240:52.42]You show your kids my videos.
[240:54.74]Uh, I think you might see some bad behavior coming through.
[241:01.00]Until they're 18+.
[241:05.49]No, what do you want me to say?
[241:06.63]Okay, wait till they're 12 before they show you a video of me in Minecraft.
[241:10.33]I don't know.
[241:10.67]What do you want me to say?
[241:11.67]This is an 18 plus stream.
[241:12.75]Oh, yay, yay.
[241:21.81]Goddamn.
[241:24.69]X rated.
[241:25.26]No, X rated.
[241:25.96]Rated R is not rated X.
[241:32.05]Rated R is rated R. Oh, man.
[241:43.40]What the fuck is a Jerma?
[241:47.42]I don't know, man.
[241:49.38]It's me.
[241:51.80]It's me.
[241:52.66]Alright, I am going to get out of here.
[241:59.83]Immediately.
[242:01.19]My whole body hurts.
[242:02.73]I am in so... I am, like, actually in, like, physical pain.
[242:07.39]Three VR days in a row is not... I don't think that's a good idea anymore.
[242:14.32]I'm okay, though.
[242:15.06]I'm alright.
[242:17.50]I am gonna just run away right now.
[242:22.84]I'll see you guys on... Wait, what's today's date?
[242:26.65]I'll see you guys on Friday or Saturday.
[242:28.49]Probably Saturday.
[242:29.09]We'll do Saturday, Sunday.
[242:29.92]I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[242:40.66]Do a raid?
[242:41.26]Oh, you know what?
[242:41.90]You know who I want to raid?
[242:44.12]I want to raid BoxBox because BoxBox raided the stream with like 4,000 people last week or the week before.
[242:50.95]And I just fucking ignored it completely.
[242:54.25]It was like an absolute, I didn't even, it was a total ignore.
[242:57.87]I didn't even know what happened.
[243:00.39]So it was like, oh, box, box, raid, here it comes.
[243:02.81]I didn't even know.
[243:03.47]And I'm just saying, let's go back and say thanks for the raid from two weeks ago.
[243:11.66]Sing the raid song.
[243:14.60]Wow, you're a piece of shit.
[243:15.88]How did I even miss it?
[243:16.90]I don't even know what I was doing.
[243:19.00]I felt so bad afterwards.
[243:20.16]I was like, wait, no, that's...
[243:22.75]Xbox is awesome.
[243:24.19]There was like a lot of people too.
[243:28.35]They're playing team fight tactics if you're into that.
[243:30.35]I don't even know how it works.
[243:32.23]I've tried to watch it before.
[243:33.27]It's just 10 enemies line up and then somebody presses the go button and they just run into each other.
[243:38.96]I don't know how it works.
[243:40.20]Apparently it's hard.
[243:42.90]Team fight tactics, not Team Fortress tactics.
[243:52.11]It's hard?
[243:52.71]Well, alright.
[243:54.25]I play Hearthstone Battlegrounds.
[243:56.11]I've come in first place ten times.
[243:58.29]Yep, I did.
[243:59.87]By the way, I've come in fourth place, or higher, almost a hundred times.
[244:05.71]I am currently rated about 3,500.
[244:07.47]That's not bad for somebody that's bad at everything.
[244:12.31]But I'm not bad at everything.
[244:13.27]I just say that so then I can surprise you.
[244:17.60]Go say hello to BoxBox.
[244:20.31]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[244:20.99]I'll see you on probably Saturday.
[244:22.93]We're gonna move away from VR.
[244:26.27]No, you are bad.
[244:28.09]Stay hydrated.
[244:28.59]Yeah, I'm gonna go get some water.
[244:29.64]Get some food.
[244:30.04]Take a bath.
[244:31.20]I need it.
[244:31.50]Have a great rest of your night, everybody.
[244:34.40]See you in a few days.
[244:38.30]Good night.
[245:16.77]Thank you.
