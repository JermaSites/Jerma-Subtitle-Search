[00:42.66]Fucking The Last Jedi!
[00:44.16]New trailer!
[00:47.18]Didn't even watch it.
[00:49.30]This is the Lord of the Rings stream, so why are we talking about Star Wars?
[00:54.40]It's out.
[00:57.56]We're early by about five minutes.
[01:00.14]That movie's gonna suck.
[01:02.10]Whatever.
[01:04.57]Look, don't you guys understand?
[01:07.96]All the Star Wars movies suck.
[01:10.48]But they're, like, fun and they're cool.
[01:12.16]Like, go back and watch the prequels.
[01:13.72]They're fucking terrible cinema.
[01:17.39]Like, The Empire Strikes Back is, like, the only good Star Wars movie.
[01:23.19]Like, come on.
[01:25.21]But they're a cultural... The characters and the story... It's a whole universe.
[01:35.25]Return of the Jedi was cool.
[01:38.92]It was good.
[01:40.04]A New Hope was cool.
[01:40.84]But Empire Strikes Back is the Star Wars movie.
[01:45.42]When you think of the Star Wars movies.
[01:55.27]It was a joke.
[01:56.17]Don't take me out of context.
[01:58.11]I'm a goddamn comedian.
[02:00.95]Everything I say is a joke.
[02:02.51]We're talking about a comedian doing a stand-up routine for you here.
[02:06.91]You guys are sitting in the crowd, and I'm on the stage, and this is a stand-up comedy comedian routine.
[02:18.34]I love Star Wars.
[02:19.76]Dude, half of my wardrobe is Star Wars.
[02:22.60]You don't think I like Star Wars?
[02:25.90]I have more images.
[02:28.28]of tattooing on articles of clothing than I do branded names.
[02:35.04]So, come on, give me a break.
[02:36.04]This is me speaking from the heart here.
[02:40.54]That's not a backpedal.
[02:41.50]That is not a backpedal.
[02:45.90]A backpedal would be saying that, like, look, I own a bunch of Star Wars clothes, so therefore I can't, like, that is backpedaling.
[02:53.29]To what?
[02:56.49]My bike is one of those bikes, you know when you were a kid and you used to own a bike?
[03:00.15]And the brakes were on your backpedal?
[03:04.13]I didn't like that.
[03:04.77]I liked having the brakes in the front.
[03:06.59]And I liked being able to go backwards, backpedaling.
[03:09.64]I didn't like, I would sometimes, I would do it, sometimes I would be going down like a hill, and I'd want to like slow down a little bit, but like I would want to go backwards, but I'd step on the back, and I would fly forward on the handlebars.
[03:19.54]And I would just drag my face on the pavement, just like... That's why I look so, that's why I'm so ugly.
[03:30.86]Alright, anyways, let's play fucking Shadow of War.
[03:36.18]That explains a lot.
[03:37.04]Yeah, it does.
[03:41.22]People are just going to trickle in while we put the screen on.
[03:44.78]Did I even make the tweet?
[03:47.82]Backpedal back to flanker.
[03:49.30]Maybe.
[03:51.10]There we go.
[03:51.52]I got a tweet out.
[03:52.84]We're early.
[03:53.44]We're early.
[03:54.04]I don't have to do anything.
[03:56.59]I could sit here for five more minutes and just talk about, like, fucking Star Wars and skinning my face on the pavement with a bike.
[04:04.73]So, there's microtransactions in this game.
[04:06.83]Apparently.
[04:09.61]I mean, what are you gonna do?
[04:12.53]Like, what am I gonna do about it?
[04:14.09]You want me to do, like, a 50k sunboxing?
[04:16.90]No.
[04:18.74]Uh, anyways, thank you to StixRenegade for $5.
[04:20.78]You bamboozled me last stream.
[04:22.42]Also, what happened to the PC build stream?
[04:24.95]It's still happening.
[04:26.67]In fact, I actually was thinking about that like a week ago.
[04:30.77]I need to get all the parts that I need to be able to build it.
[04:34.51]It's going to be a microtransaction stream.
[04:37.27]I know that very well could happen.
[04:40.71]Should I ironically buy like $500 worth of boxes?
[04:45.85]But in that case, it's not ironic anymore.
[04:47.47]You're not like ironically doing it because you spent $500 in the game.
[04:53.45]I mean, I guess I could do like a funny joke.
[04:55.51]Oh, look at me.
[04:56.03]I'm doing like a case unboxing for Shadow of War.
[05:01.32]No, I'm not going to do that.
[05:03.80]Maybe I'll, you know, I might buy like the starter pack.
[05:06.02]What is it, like six bucks?
[05:08.20]And you get like 25 extra gems to speed up the process.
[05:11.29]Is there like a timed speed up thing in this game?
[05:13.11]If there is, I'm going to be very angry.
[05:16.77]But anyways, thank you, Sticks.
[05:18.65]Brutal Eddie, thanks for the $15.
[05:20.63]Hey, Jerma, just wanted to ask if you can give a happy birthday message to my best friend, Caitlin.
[05:25.51]Caitlin?
[05:28.12]That last name, I don't know how to say it.
[05:30.54]I'm going to try.
[05:33.46]Is it Caitlin...
[05:36.30]Actually, no, I don't want to say the last name.
[05:37.59]Because, like, I don't even know.
[05:39.83]That's first and full, first and last name.
[05:42.27]We'll go Caitlyn Kay.
[05:43.68]Caitlyn Kay.
[05:44.12]I'll go with that one.
[05:45.34]We're both big fans of yours, and I was thinking this would be a perfect game.
[05:47.64]Well, hey, Caitlyn Kay.
[05:51.41]There's an N in your name, too.
[05:52.99]Happy birthday.
[05:54.35]Have a glorious birthday.
[05:55.61]Hopefully they throw a huge party for you, Caitlin.
[05:58.13]I hope there's, like, balloons and shit, like, big, like, blue balloons everywhere that you could pop.
[06:02.93]Because I was not allowed to pop balloons when I was a kid.
[06:05.01]I wanted just to squeeze them and have them explode in my face, but I wasn't, like, allowed to.
[06:08.58]Because they were scared it was going to, like, hurt me.
[06:10.48]But I would do it.
[06:11.14]I would do it on the side.
[06:12.08]I would just go in the other room and just be like, bang!
[06:13.84]And be like, yes!
[06:15.72]But, you know, that's the way it is.
[06:18.26]Thank you, Brutal Eddie, though, for the 15 bucks.
[06:20.08]Hopefully you have a good day.
[06:22.82]Uh, Lyro... Thank you, Lyro Se... Lyro Sitter!
[06:29.04]Lyrositor, thanks for the ten bucks.
[06:30.54]I'm off to bed now, but I'm glad I was able to catch the stream.
[06:32.87]Well, you got the very beginning.
[06:34.21]Thanks for the ten bucks.
[06:34.91]Have fun.
[06:35.23]Thank you.
[06:37.81]I think we should get started.
[06:42.33]I'm getting violent already.
[06:44.98]What do you mean?
[06:45.72]I'm not getting violent.
[06:48.82]But, like, no more jokes aside, thank you, everybody, for the initial bit donations there.
[06:55.21]Very much appreciate it.
[06:55.87]You guys rock.
[06:57.45]Happy birthday again to Caitlin.
[07:00.37]Yeah, you know what hopefully fucking Eddie got you a diamond ring I'm sorry.
[07:04.29]I just like I just like threw you under the bus I've been looking forward to this game for a while I've the shadow of Mordor was one of my favorite games of 2014 so obviously this is I'm a huge fan So we've gotten like we're getting spoiled here in October because like I've been waiting for Cuphead that game was awesome I was waiting for this new sequel by monolith.
[07:23.38]Hopefully it's good and
[07:25.36]So I've been waiting for these last couple of games.
[07:27.22]And by the way, Hand of Fate 2 also got a release date.
[07:30.96]November 7th.
[07:31.70]So this is... I've got a lot of Game of the Year potential contenders coming up here in the next month.
[07:36.52]We'll see.
[07:39.16]Hat in Time came out.
[07:40.18]I want to check that out too.
[07:41.04]There's like... So many games came out in like four days.
[07:44.93]Starting a new game.
[07:46.33]Here we go.
[07:47.67]Delete, save... Yeah, I just... I opened it up to... To like make sure like the graphics I could capture it and everything.
[07:54.09]So...
[07:55.64]Oh, and these items will be transferred.
[07:56.88]All boosts.
[07:57.52]I don't have any boosts.
[07:59.48]I didn't even do anything.
[08:01.94]Normal difficulty is fine.
[08:03.08]I don't need to do anything crazy.
[08:04.34]I just like to play.
[08:07.54]Go for it.
[08:08.00]Here comes the cutscene.
[08:08.96]I don't know.
[08:09.34]Let's see.
[08:11.10]Open loot crates.
[08:12.06]No.
[08:13.74]So the story so far.
[08:14.62]Let's see what it is.
[08:17.04]That's like the... That's buried in my brain.
[08:20.44]I didn't know that was there, but I knew it was there because I saw this part.
[08:24.08]Family mosque.
[08:29.46]This is beautiful.
[08:30.66]And a son.
[08:34.64]And I buried them along with everyone I even knew.
[08:41.29]Yep.
[08:41.83]What has happened to me?
[08:44.87]Am I dead?
[08:48.19]You are not dead.
[08:49.93]I am Celebrimborn.
[08:52.05]And I have been eating maggoty bread for three stinking days.
[09:00.76]I'm sorry.
[09:01.53]I'm like excited.
[09:02.31]I'm too excited.
[09:11.33]The rings are piled up.
[09:15.69]Not YouTube.
[09:16.49]Where's the PSVR bullshit?
[09:17.83]We did it yesterday.
[09:18.61]Like four days ago.
[09:20.65]I like this game.
[09:22.01]I made a video on Shadow of Mordor.
[09:25.60]It's like one of my favorite games of 2014.
[09:31.73]Yeah, come on, Khal Drogo.
[09:32.93]Khal Drogo.
[09:34.05]Can I talk now?
[09:34.43]Alright, the new ring prologue.
[09:37.17]Here we go.
[09:38.24]Game sucks.
[09:38.74]What are you talking about?
[09:39.68]No.
[09:39.78]No.
[10:02.77]Don't talk about how much the game sucks.
[10:05.48]Do you see these facial animations?
[10:09.24]They're perfect.
[10:11.53]Took a year to make that one segment.
[10:19.24]In an open field, Ned.
[10:20.98]In an open field, Ned.
[10:23.68]In the fires of Mount Doom.
[10:26.46]A ranger and a wraith.
[10:28.54]Dude, we don't do well in cutscenes.
[10:30.24]I've noticed that.
[10:31.22]I don't do well in cutscenes.
[10:32.10]There's the one thing that could challenge the Dark Lord.
[10:36.18]A ring.
[10:39.88]Why are we watching the cutscene if I don't... Well, I don't know.
[10:50.83]Alright, so Caelid Rimbaugh just got taken.
[10:55.37]And I'm in Mount Doom.
[10:56.65]I was just, like, shitfaced.
[10:59.53]I just, like, woke up after a party.
[11:00.83]None of it happened.
[11:07.48]Shadow of War, you go back to the first game and play through it for real this time.
[11:15.06]They actually have an official emote for the game?
[11:16.94]Didn't this happen in the first game?
[11:27.79]Nothing can be changed.
[11:30.09]Funny advertisement.
[11:30.91]I want to buy a Dorito.
[11:32.67]This is not like a sponsored stream.
[11:43.16]I like this game.
[11:45.98]This is not like an ad for fucking...
[11:53.87]The Lord of the Rings.
[11:54.53]Do you think the Lord of the Rings needs any ads, by the way?
[11:56.55]It's just the fucking one donut to rule them all, apparently.
[12:02.25]Okay, let's do it.
[12:14.12]I gotta go get Celebrimbor back.
[12:19.96]We gotta listen to Nolan North be in every video game.
[12:23.01]Or was it Trey, um... Trey Parker?
[12:25.65]No, Trey Parker's the South Park guy.
[12:27.01]Who's the guy that's in every video game?
[12:28.57]It's Nolan North and another guy, something Trey.
[12:31.89]Trey Nolan?
[12:34.55]Yeah, but Trey Nolan is the main character in every video game.
[12:37.14]So, like, let's hear what he has to say.
[12:50.68]Oh, outfit change, okay.
[12:53.33]Nolan Baker.
[12:54.57]Yeah, there he is.
[12:57.37]No one cares about voice actors.
[12:58.79]I do!
[12:59.21]What?
[12:59.63]What are you talking about?
[13:05.32]I love voice acting.
[13:06.36]I love voice actors.
[13:12.26]Why isn't he invisible?
[13:13.16]Okay, I think it's a different ring.
[13:14.14]It's not the one that Bilbo had.
[13:17.27]It's a different ring of power.
[13:20.32]Alright, here we go.
[13:20.88]We get to actually play Shadows of War.
[13:22.32]Find Celebrimbor.
[13:23.12]Hold RT to enter stealth.
[13:25.42]Press X to stealth kill.
[13:28.48]Alright, you got it.
[13:34.04]Just like I remember.
[13:34.88]You stick it right in the ear.
[13:39.15]Back in the old one, I remember you could get in trouble and the mission would fail.
[13:45.01]I love this game.
[13:56.34]Should I just sprint?
[13:57.84]This obviously is the initial beginning cutscene, right?
[14:02.40]Let's just go.
[14:04.70]It's teaching me all the mechanics.
[14:06.00]I already know how to play.
[14:08.34]Like, for Christ's sake, you know what I mean?
[14:13.78]See, I already know how to play this game.
[14:20.09]Alright, let's find Celebrimbor.
[14:30.49]The orcs are just as stupid in this game.
[14:32.09]It's great.
[14:35.87]Yeah.
[14:37.57]Let's do the same thing to this guy.
[14:38.73]Oh, I just, like, dropped him in front of those guys.
[14:46.34]That's great.
[14:48.96]Game sounds too quiet.
[14:49.78]I'll turn it up.
[14:51.40]But I can't get on there.
[14:53.66]What the fuck?
[14:54.08]I can't, like, walk on this?
[14:58.30]Let's go.
[15:04.81]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[15:06.05]Hold on.
[15:06.41]I'll turn it back up for you.
[15:11.60]And let's go with master volume.
[15:18.64]Oh, can you please?
[15:22.05]That's a little better.
[15:27.59]There we go.
[15:30.75]Now it's louder.
[15:36.03]Stealth drain, stealth kill.
[15:37.55]Oh yeah, you drain people, you can take their brains.
[15:41.26]Oh, that's the aerial stealth kill.
[15:44.00]Let's wait until this guy gets out of the way and we'll do it to him.
[15:46.83]Nope, I guess we're doing it to this guy.
[15:52.07]There's a guy right next to me.
[15:53.25]How did that guy not see me?
[15:54.75]What?
[15:58.45]I don't understand.
[15:59.27]Alright, well I made it.
[16:01.75]All day to sprint.
[16:06.72]Drain their blood and steal their IQ.
[16:11.23]This is different.
[16:11.89]Spiders.
[16:13.63]Oh, ranger.
[16:16.31]Sneak through.
[16:19.64]Totino's pizza stab.
[16:25.02]Oh, no.
[16:25.40]Not the Totino's pizza roll ring donut stab.
[16:35.31]How many pizza rolls do you think I could eat?
[16:36.97]If I was really hungry.
[16:39.37]You want to talk about like sponsored content?
[16:40.75]How many pizza rolls do you think I could eat?
[16:47.27]Fifty?
[16:47.57]I don't know about that.
[16:48.55]Do I have to fight Shelob?
[16:50.37]Nice.
[17:03.74]Is it weird that this game, like, just makes me want to go play, like, Dark Souls or Demon's Souls?
[17:11.03]Does that, like, make any... Wait.
[17:14.53]What?
[17:16.01]I thought Sheila was a spider.
[17:17.13]No, she's Darth Vader-ing him.
[17:28.20]Cut it out.
[17:28.52]Cut it out.
[17:28.86]Come on.
[17:31.30]You are brave.
[17:34.87]Ready?
[17:36.62]Like, just twist the wrist into the neck.
[17:41.34]Twist neck straight into throat.
[17:42.60]Done.
[17:44.64]Freedom.
[17:51.41]I think this is supposed to be canon.
[17:53.05]I thought it was.
[17:54.13]I thought they, like, redid history or something and, like, went in the middle where, like, nobody cared.
[18:04.21]She's speaking Slytherin.
[18:06.53]Yeah.
[18:06.93]Well, that's a lie.
[18:08.25]Okay.
[18:08.45]Anybody that tells you all they do is tell the truth is lying to you first and foremost.
[18:14.71]Wait.
[18:36.98]I can't wait for all the people to cosplay as this character like next year at Comic Con.
[18:42.27]What are you doing?
[18:46.55]Why would you do that?
[18:50.71]Alright, I thought that was Gollum's hand for a second.
[18:54.25]I seriously thought that was Gollum's fucking hand.
[18:56.81]He's just like, it's mine now.
[18:58.32]I got it.
[18:58.78]And he just sprints away.
[19:00.18]I just get the bad ending.
[19:05.96]Go to your puppet before he dies.
[19:07.60]You idiot.
[19:15.12]Why did you give her the Ring of Power?
[19:17.92]Now we will forever have a throat cut.
[19:20.40]Nostalgia.
[19:22.24]Her power was vast before, and now you have given her mine.
[19:27.30]I poured my life force into that ring.
[19:33.15]Bad end beginning.
[19:34.83]Imagine if it was that easy.
[19:43.30]Here we go!
[19:48.08]Alright, now time is frozen.
[19:52.58]This is good stuff.
[19:54.34]The war you came to fight is not here.
[20:00.02]The ring is lost.
[20:03.15]This guy's an idiot.
[20:04.69]I thought Sheila was like a fucking random spider.
[20:07.97]Did they rewrite this whole character or was she like a goddess?
[20:13.56]I don't understand this.
[20:32.72]Okay, so I have to make an army now.
[20:34.58]Oh, shit.
[20:36.14]I have to go play Clash of Clans for 28 hours.
[20:39.20]It's the only way to get the ring back and save Mordor.
[20:52.28]Pretty much.
[20:55.60]The detonate skill allows you to shadow strike into a fire pit, detonating it and lighting enemies on fire.
[21:02.46]Interesting tip.
[21:06.07]Act 1, the Siege of Minas Tirith.
[21:10.01]Siege of Minas Ithil.
[21:15.16]Perfect fucking Star Wars landscape, by the way.
[21:20.44]This is the first major battle of the game.
[21:21.78]This is where it teaches you about major battles.
[21:24.42]Yeah, this guy doesn't even fucking know.
[21:26.90]This guy that I'm raiding right now, he has like fucking 25 globs of juice.
[21:31.31]And like 200,000 credits.
[21:34.37]I'm sending in all my fucking archers and my men while I have my iPad in my fucking hands laughing.
[21:40.05]Oh, what the fuck?
[21:40.57]He paid for that.
[21:41.23]That was like fucking 12 bucks.
[21:44.48]Bullshit.
[21:50.86]Nice meme.
[21:53.84]Take his mother base.
[21:54.74]Yeah, we have to go hit his gold mine a few times.
[21:59.94]Sending archers into battle in Clash of Clans.

[22:08.57]Stop trying to make jokes and next already.
[22:11.39]I've been looking forward to this game for like two years.
[22:13.71]I'm not going to next this game.
[22:15.49]I've wanted to play this game since they announced it fucking like a year ago.
[22:20.22]I'm not just playing this game because I'm, like, trying to jump on the stream bandwagon and, oh, a new game came out!
[22:25.30]I gotta stream it to get viewers!
[22:27.35]No, I wanna play this!
[22:28.23]I've been looking forward to this fucking game for two years!
[22:36.05]Didn't you see my Mordor Mine Invader video?
[22:37.95]I love this game.
[22:38.73]And my fucking Game of the Year 2014!
[22:41.44]I'm not just jumping on a bandwagon here because, like, I heard about it.

[22:55.09]Alright, here we go.
[22:56.91]Remember this?
[22:57.51]Remember this part in that video I made?
[23:02.83]See?
[23:08.96]Nice pose.
[23:09.68]Did someone say pose?
[23:11.48]Leap of faith.
[23:13.18]Need loot boxes to actually play the game.
[23:15.65]Stop it.
[23:16.89]Let's enjoy...
[23:18.83]The Shades of War.
[23:19.81]Okay, these are Siren's captains leading the siege.
[23:23.84]Interrogating Verbs grants intel.
[23:25.10]Press A to get intel on this captain.
[23:28.42]Yeah, you gain ACT intel on people.
[23:30.32]Gaining intel on captains reveals their weaknesses, allowing you to precisely target their vulnerabilities and use the power of the Wraith to amplify their fears.
[23:36.38]Right.
[23:36.72]So you learn about them and sometimes some people can't be attacked.
[23:39.71]Some people are afraid of dogs.
[23:40.91]Some people are afraid of cats.
[23:42.35]Some people can be instantly killed from behind.
[23:44.69]Some people use mallets.
[23:46.17]Okay.
[23:46.73]He's a commander who will always be surrounded by his gang of grunts.
[23:49.83]Get him.
[23:55.76]Captain leading the search is in the lower city.
[23:58.93]Wait, hold on I thought you didn't have to kill them When did you get like a brain explode ability?

[24:33.23]What do you know?
[24:35.27]Let's get some more... Let's get some details on you.
[24:39.22]Okay, what about the guy next to you?
[24:42.82]Skak, the lookout.
[24:45.62]Can be killed instantly using fire.
[24:49.16]Mortal beast fodder can be killed instantly by beasts.
[24:52.32]Can be killed instantly by poison.
[24:53.60]There's poison in the game now, okay.
[24:58.07]But don't blow... I don't want to kill them.
[24:59.67]I don't want to kill these guys.
[25:01.43]Why am I blowing their heads up?
[25:02.69]Alright, let's just go.
[25:08.25]Let's just make our way around.

[25:29.35]Oh, that guy was brainless.
[25:37.60]Let me, like, get a bunch of guys to surround me.
[25:40.94]Come here.
[25:46.16]Submit!
[25:50.21]But this guy's almost dead unknown captain rug the steady new Intel learned he's terrified of caragas terrified of poison, okay Alright now we got the goblets fall the trail I do want to just play with like this attack the times The combat was very fun in this game Hold RT and X. Yep.

[26:26.45]Do you know why not to say tacos?
[26:28.78]What?
[26:30.82]Let's play this smart.
[26:32.42]You can take the guy on the left out.
[26:35.68]The guy on the right's too busy scratching his ass.
[26:38.16]What?
[26:40.41]No.
[26:41.21]Wait, this is just... These are all captains.
[26:42.87]Oh, okay.

[26:50.71]It's all Captains.
[26:52.61]Hold LT to RAAAAA.
[26:54.23]Hold RRT to charge a shot for massive damage.
[26:57.41]Release it to fire.
[26:58.23]Charge shot to the head is devastating.
[26:59.61]Yes, it is.
[27:04.82]One, two, three, four.
[27:09.34]Then all of them are dead.
[27:10.92]That's how you kill every single person.
[27:13.57]Out of focus.
[27:14.31]Charges over time.
[27:15.01]Yes, it does.
[27:18.59]Um... Investigate the clue.
[27:23.51]Oh, bring the trail into focus.
[27:25.27]What do you mean, bring it into focus?
[27:31.70]It's just like a magic eye.
[27:35.14]Oh.
[27:35.86]Okay, what the fuck?
[27:38.10]This guy has, like, hoof prints?
[27:42.65]Alright.
[27:46.23]Fun mini-game.
[27:47.59]Yeah, that was kind of pointless.
[27:52.91]What the hell did this guy step in?
[27:58.26]He stepped into unicorn shit.
[28:01.04]You can't get that off your shoes for weeks.
[28:02.90]Oh shit, I have no more elf shot.
[28:07.88]Alright, here we go.
[28:08.52]This is where I want to play the game here.
[28:10.11]This is how you play the game.
[28:11.51]New Dark Souls role.
[28:13.17]I like it.
[28:19.58]God, I love, like, the Batman combat.
[28:23.96]Nothing's more fun in this game than fucking Batman Arkham Asylum.
[28:32.67]Dark Souls.
[28:34.41]I'm gonna, like, be doing that way more than I should just because I'm used to playing those games.
[28:41.17]I'm not gonna get...
[28:46.56]Am I actually gonna get a breadcrumb trail to every location?
[28:50.22]I hope.
[28:50.52]I really hope I don't have to do the unicorn shit thing the entire game.
[28:58.92]Fast, fast.
[28:59.60]Yeah, so you do the Superman speedrun.
[29:03.37]Into the Wraith world?
[29:05.45]Oh, right.
[29:06.31]Search for the captain and press to identify.
[29:08.43]Okay, where is he?
[29:10.91]There he is.
[29:15.70]Hog Leek.
[29:16.68]Hog Leek the Warbringer.
[29:18.66]Dazed by stealth.
[29:19.74]Becomes dazed after stealth attacks.
[29:21.34]Okay.
[29:22.02]You got it.
[29:23.56]Can be injured by executions.
[29:25.68]Y and B is an execution.
[29:26.96]Damaged by executions.
[29:28.74]So I don't think I can hurt him any other way.
[29:30.32]So he's arrow-proof.
[29:32.20]He's advanced.
[29:35.14]Yeah, we're gonna climb up there.
[29:36.34]This is our first real test to see if we can play Shadow of the Internet.
[29:41.46]Where everybody just posts fucking memes.
[29:48.68]I'm going all the way up.
[29:53.18]He's got a lot of people with him.
[29:58.60]This is my favorite part.
[30:02.48]You can just hear them talk.
[30:04.44]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[30:07.08]That didn't make much sense.
[30:09.68]Can I sneak up behind this guy?
[30:12.96]Can I just get up right behind him and fucking get him?
[30:16.12]I hope so.
[30:16.54]Yeah, this is going to be great.
[30:20.05]Leap behind.
[30:21.73]Wait, can I just, like, call him?
[30:24.17]What?
[30:24.69]Should I?
[30:26.09]Should I just jump behind him?
[30:26.93]No, I want to, like, pull him off the edge.
[30:30.75]Where's, like, the attract button?
[30:37.39]Oh, no, I thought it was my... Come on.
[30:38.90]What the fuck?
[30:39.42]I thought it meant, like, leap behind him.
[30:43.80]Leap behind.
[30:44.36]I thought it meant, like, get behind... Like, leap behind that guy in front of me.
[30:48.65]And this, I can't attract.
[30:51.85]I can attract this guy.
[30:52.95]Just gotta put a little bit of hair gel in.
[30:58.17]Can you get up there, please?
[31:00.41]Why can I not climb up this?
[31:05.82]Alright, let's get him!
[31:15.08]This is why this is game of the fuckin' century.
[31:18.89]Who the fuck are you?
[31:22.87]Okay.
[31:24.01]What, I have like little party members?
[31:26.93]Shit, I was trying to execute you.
[31:32.09]Is this some random girl that comes over?
[31:35.49]Alright, this guy, I have to only hurt him with executions.
[31:43.08]I think.
[31:43.40]No, actually, I've never done that.
[31:48.74]Right in the snots.
[31:49.66]Right in the snots.
[31:50.72]That guy's not dead?
[31:54.04]What?
[31:54.36]Come on.
[31:54.72]Alright, you're not invincible.
[31:56.86]I forgot.
[31:57.20]You're only invincible during the actual executions.
[31:59.22]Right here.
[32:05.83]Right in the neck.
[32:07.81]Yep.
[32:08.35]You're dead.
[32:11.05]This guy better not be my nemesis.
[32:13.17]You know what I mean?
[32:14.85]Don't kill Stanley.
[32:15.65]Come on.
[32:22.43]Alright, here we go.
[32:23.17]Nice job.
[32:24.97]Good work.
[32:27.27]Pick up gear.
[32:28.09]Yeah, defeating captains allows Calibrim Boar to forge powerful gear.
[32:30.60]You can manage your gear in the inventory menu.
[32:32.92]Why would I care about that when I can just buy?
[32:35.00]When I can just buy boxes.
[32:39.16]Equip gear to increase your ability and your power.
[32:41.20]And I didn't even read that sentence correctly.
[32:42.77]Victories against more powerful captains are able to hire better legendaries.
[32:46.79]Or just press A to open a box.
[32:49.94]New gear.
[32:50.42]Is this a dagger?
[32:53.42]Yeah.
[32:53.90]Okay.
[32:56.35]Change gear.
[32:57.11]Change gear.
[32:58.05]It's a sword.
[32:58.77]Yeah.
[32:59.97]Rohirrim sword.
[33:01.13]Design based off a sword issued to Riders of Rohan.
[33:04.89]Wow.
[33:05.47]Isn't that swell?
[33:08.57]The market is locked.
[33:09.72]Okay.
[33:13.46]Garrisons.
[33:14.32]Quests.
[33:14.78]Oh man.
[33:15.24]This is so much.
[33:16.00]They added too many things to this game I think.
[33:22.22]So this is an actual, like, important character.
[33:26.30]Is the game free?
[33:27.28]No.
[33:27.34]It's a $60 game that has microtransactions, apparently.
[33:29.80]But... You know.
[33:30.10]Video games.
[33:32.28]You know what I mean?
[33:35.08]Video games in 2017.
[33:51.34]Find the whales.
[33:54.38]All these game developers just get on a fucking boat and they search for whales.
[33:59.42]One jumps out of the water and does like a huge backwards turning splash and just hanging over its head is like this person will spend $14,000 in the game store and they like fucking throw a spear at that whale.
[34:14.15]Faro.
[34:15.31]Eidrol.
[34:22.33]Question marks.
[34:23.45]Whale is a term that the game industry uses for people that spend a dickload of money in video games, like in the microtransaction stores.
[34:29.20]They're called whales.
[34:31.24]I don't know where they came from.
[34:35.46]All I know is they're called whales.
[34:36.86]I don't know why they wouldn't be called, like, manatees.
[34:41.34]Holy shit, that guy exploded.
[34:44.38]Why is it called whale?
[34:46.74]Shouldn't it be like tortoise?
[34:49.84]Somebody that like spends like $50,000 on a video game.
[34:52.77]A whale is like a majestic creature.
[34:57.19]A tortoise like is a slow, just like sits around like a sloth or something.
[35:03.91]Giant sloth is what the term should be, not whale.
[35:06.23]Where are you going?
[35:12.30]Come here, you fucking Benny Hill piece of shit.
[35:15.86]I want some fucking intel.
[35:18.25]Wow, you actually just explode their brains.
[35:19.65]That's so cool.
[35:22.15]It is a long-ranged head explosion.
[35:25.49]There's a lot of people here.
[35:31.96]Don't be mean to tortoises.
[35:33.10]No, I'm a fucking tortoise.
[35:34.40]You guys don't think I'm self-aware about this?
[35:39.96]I've spent, like, a shitload of money on a mobile game before.
[35:43.77]Dude, I used to play Family Guy, like, Quest Town.
[35:47.23]I spent, like, a hundred bucks on that game.
[35:50.83]It was just, I had to do it.
[35:52.69]It just got in my brain.
[35:53.65]I was a fucking tortoise.
[35:56.36]I would sit there and, like, tap.
[35:58.26]I'd go, I need some more Family Guy money.
[36:00.04]I don't even like Family Guy that much.
[36:03.20]I don't know, there was no reason why I was doing it.
[36:05.82]There was absolutely not one single reason why.
[36:11.06]If I could give you an actual explanation, I would.
[36:14.69]Nope.
[36:14.93]Okay, what are you doing?
[36:17.95]Why would you crouch in front of me?
[36:19.37]Just kill him.
[36:22.59]He's getting too far away.
[36:23.51]What?
[36:25.26]I'm having fun fighting orcs.
[36:26.32]Look, that was at a time in my life when, like, I needed something.
[36:33.52]Like, you know what I mean?
[36:34.10]I was filling the void.
[36:35.70]The shitty mobile game was filling the void.
[36:39.78]Each click on an individual building and watching the cash pop up was like, yes!
[36:47.17]Let's go play.
[36:48.69]I bet you my town still... This is like years ago.
[36:50.90]This is not like last weekend.
[36:53.98]The Void.
[36:54.56]I'm obviously just playing around.
[36:56.90]Those guys just got scared and left.
[37:00.68]$100 on a mobile game?
[37:01.26]That's nothing.
[37:02.49]I know.
[37:05.84]We're making Clash of Clans jokes about this game, but isn't it... If you want to be the top player in Clash of Clans, you want to be top dog, like the guy that nobody can beat and the guy that constantly is always number one on the leaderboards, don't you have to spend like $30,000 a month to be able to do that?
[37:26.97]That's what I was always under the assumption of.
[37:33.03]Clear the area.
[37:33.69]Yep.
[37:34.07]Lots of good clearing.
[37:35.51]The sergeant over here needs to be rescued, but what about these guys?
[37:41.14]Let's go with a one.
[37:44.46]Two.
[37:51.91]I accidentally shot that guy right in the head.
[37:54.67]And apparently it doesn't hurt him.
[37:58.21]They're sealing the gate!
[38:01.56]Why is a sponsored streamer not announcing his sponsors?
[38:05.40]That's not gonna be the joke for the rest of the night.
[38:07.12]I refuse for that to be the thing that's funny.
[38:10.82]And I get it.
[38:11.70]I know it's funny.
[38:12.70]I know.
[38:13.54]I know that, like, maybe a portion of the people that are playing this game right now probably got, like, a contract to play it.
[38:20.58]I didn't get that contract.
[38:21.65]And I might just be talking out of my ass.
[38:23.81]But that's what happened last time.
[38:25.21]I don't know.
[38:25.51]It wasn't me.
[38:26.91]I like this game.
[38:27.55]I like Lord of the Rings.
[38:29.31]I think Shmog is a fucking awesome character.
[38:31.41]I like the Hobbit.
[38:32.46]I like the Ents.
[38:33.38]I like the tree people.
[38:35.56]I think Frodo Baggins, Elijah Wood, great guy, great actor, really pulled it off, Academy Award winning.
[38:45.33]Mind games, I have two contract.
[38:53.81]Oh, nice.
[38:58.54]See, it's an award winner, it is.
[39:00.10]Quickly, under the gate!
[39:01.68]Get moving!
[39:03.87]The worst thing about, like, money tube.
[39:05.40]That's what I'm going to call it from now.
[39:06.84]The worst thing about, like, money tube.
[39:09.23]And, like, the world we live in where, like, everything apparently has to be sponsored and, like, you have to make money from everything you do, every single stream, every single fucking YouTube video, right?
[39:18.97]This is new.
[39:19.41]Hold on.
[39:20.91]Anyways, let me finish this thought before I, like, hold down X. Like, enjoying anything anymore, like, you have to have somebody in your pocket.
[39:30.07]Like, if I enjoy this game, it's like, hold on a second.
[39:34.03]I don't know about that.
[39:36.12]I've seen a lot of people make money from this.
[39:38.39]And it's like, it sucks.
[39:39.31]I know, I get it.
[39:39.95]It sucks.
[39:42.00]If I like Nikes, if I like talk to you about like, oh, you know, I've got this new pair of Nikes yesterday.
[39:46.46]They fit well and they're comfortable.
[39:48.32]Somebody had to have paid me for me to say that in a lot of your brains, right?
[39:53.12]How did we get here?
[39:59.01]I like this.
[40:03.35]I bet you, I guarantee you anything that I get to learn more moves that tie into that.
[40:08.37]I'm just gonna be charge guy.
[40:13.01]I'm having fun.
[40:21.37]Sellout.
[40:21.91]It's not even like sellout though.
[40:23.53]We've gotten so weird where like fucking everything has to be paid for.
[40:29.87]Like if you enjoy anything, it has to be paid for.
[40:36.83]It's a weapon art.
[40:37.57]It really is.
[40:40.62]We've lost the middle city.
[40:42.78]Stop memeing.
[40:43.34]What did I say?
[40:43.76]We paid for every inch of ground, but they now hold it.
[40:48.30]Missed.
[40:48.64]Our fate will be decided here.
[40:52.60]Our inner wall is our strongest.
[40:54.64]We have double their archer.
[40:57.58]But the thing is, like, I understand where you guys are coming from.
[40:59.88]I do.
[41:01.40]Because it seems like a ton of people that do this do it because they can just, like, put a bunch of hashtags in their Twitter bios.
[41:08.81]You know what I mean?
[41:10.45]It's like, go find, like, a YouTuber or a streamer and see how many hashtags are in their Twitter bio.
[41:17.04]Just for fun.
[41:18.18]Just check it out sometime.
[41:20.03]Like, it's almost like people are like, oh, how many, like, how many, like, hashtags can I put in my Twitter fucking bio for things that I, like, why I'm so important?
[41:27.70]I'm telling you.
[41:32.20]You'll see it.
[41:32.98]Jotinos.
[41:33.30]This comment has been sponsored.

[43:17.75]That's true.
[43:18.13]Look!
[43:18.25]That's what you think this is?
[43:19.29]He's mocking me.
[43:20.47]That's the reason why he took over this city.
[43:47.85]Secure the Palantir.
[43:49.11]Complete empty Sims quests to prevent the Palantir from falling into Saren's hands.
[43:56.36]I was reaching there.
[43:57.20]Sorry.
[43:57.50]I was going to say fucking baseball.
[43:59.70]I was going to say complete the World Series quest.
[44:01.78]But you know, that would go over a lot of people's heads.
[44:03.56]It would go over my own head.
[44:04.58]So we're going to go back to The Sims.
[44:06.94]Empty fucking Sims joke.
[44:09.58]Yeah, complete this.
[44:12.78]Press to look at the regional map.
[44:15.97]He's mocking me.
[44:18.78]Story quests are indicated by the T. I'm just going to call it T. Mordor also teams with captains.
[44:26.90]You can hunt for XP and gear.
[44:28.60]Captains can be found in the world by their skull icon or by undertaking nemesis missions.
[44:32.74]Highlight the T story quest and then press A to set it as your new objective.
[44:37.30]Okay, that's cool.
[44:39.57]Fast travel points has not been unlocked.
[44:41.29]It's just like the other game.
[44:42.53]You can go get captains.
[44:45.41]Let's just, like, do this so we can get the whole world open to us.
[44:54.59]You entry to Mirion.
[44:57.37]Some kind of coinage.
[44:58.43]I don't even want to know about that, because that's probably the in-game currency that you get from a box.
[45:02.78]Alright, Elven Agility.
[45:08.48]I remember the Elven Agility thing.
[45:09.92]Yep, just get up there.
[45:12.78]Yep, you can do the giant jump.
[45:14.20]That's good.
[45:16.07]He holds his hammer up and it unlocks it.
[45:20.05]Pay to win.
[45:20.67]Well, I don't know about that yet.
[45:24.17]I'm going to give you my real opinions of the game, too.
[45:26.43]I'm not going to just sugarcoat my answers.
[45:45.03]The... God, how much fucking content is in this game?
[45:47.21]Oh, look!
[45:47.49]A secret!
[45:47.81]Like, hold on.
[45:48.11]This is like a hidden object game.
[45:49.31]Shit, if only I knew my, like, Lord of the Rings lore.
[46:14.60]I need to find the barrows.
[46:15.72]Is it down here?
[46:20.28]There it is.
[46:23.38]Seems like a decent start.
[46:25.04]There's a lot of info, but, yeah.
[46:26.87]So, I gotta go down there.
[46:27.57]So, I have to go down there.
[46:28.45]Anything else I need to look at?
[46:29.91]There's one more thing missing.
[46:48.20]Oh, well.
[46:51.10]Oh.
[46:54.22]Hold on.
[46:54.96]Why did it just do that?
[46:56.98]Why did I just get a cutscene of a guy going, Oh, he's down there.
[47:03.61]What's his problem?
[47:07.07]Can I, like, do a stealth kill from all the way up here?
[47:12.81]Let's go for it.
[47:13.83]I just had an option for it.
[47:18.19]Here we go.
[47:20.39]Oh, wrong fucking guy.
[47:21.57]God damn it.
[47:22.34]Mug.
[47:26.56]That was a very long-winded conversation.
[47:49.45]This guy had just told me like an entire storyline.
[47:53.49]Wait, poison Grog.
[47:54.35]Alright, poison him.
[47:57.27]Poison him.
[47:59.81]I can't poison him?
[48:01.21]No, only broken or dazed captains.
[48:02.95]Alright, let's daze him and I'm gonna poison him.
[48:08.03]God damn it, I broke the poison vat!
[48:11.03]Fine.
[48:12.53]I can't like rub his face in it?
[48:14.73]Rub his face in the poison.
[48:20.15]He's enraged by everything, apparently.
[48:26.02]You're not doing a very good job.
[48:27.38]I like this guy's voice.
[48:30.64]I'm trying to... Oh, I love it.
[48:34.76]Yo!
[48:34.98]Hold on, hold on a second.
[48:49.88]Hold on, let me deal with this guy first.
[48:54.66]I knew that was going to be my fucking nemesis.
[48:57.40]That stupid tutorial boss is my nemesis.
[48:59.99]Are you kidding me?
[49:01.63]What?
[49:02.65]What's happening?
[49:04.19]Last chance.
[49:09.13]No.
[49:09.83]Press the display button when the moving circle is... Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[49:13.05]Yes.
[49:13.85]So I have to go like that.
[49:18.14]God damn it.
[49:21.14]Treasure orcs.
[49:22.30]These orcs carry valuable loot.
[49:24.27]Run them down to claim their treasure.
[49:25.71]This is too much information!
[49:27.23]Is that a treasure?
[49:27.85]This is a treasure orc?
[49:29.63]This looks like a food orc to me.
[49:31.11]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[49:35.23]An archer is attacking.
[49:36.29]What?
[49:42.01]Shoot barrels to detonate them.
[49:43.63]Sure.
[49:54.99]No!
[49:56.45]No!
[49:59.99]Oh, this guy is fucking gonna- this guy's got too much health.
[50:04.16]Oh my god, get out of here.
[50:11.94]You can slide tackle?
[50:17.14]Right in the back.
[50:19.46]Come on, fucking die, dude.
[50:26.02]I'll kill you!
[50:29.44]Oh my god, damn it.
[50:33.05]We're with you, my lord.
[50:43.41]Who the fuck are you?
[50:50.09]That was fucking ridiculous.
[50:51.37]Why did he just came out of like stage left and killed him?
[50:58.31]Seriously, that was like a meme video.
[51:01.87]That was fucking crazy.
[51:03.84]I don't know if that was supposed to happen or not, but that was great.
[51:07.48]Nice deus ex machina.
[51:09.60]I have such plot armor that the game refuses to kill me right now.
[51:13.96]That's fucking perfect.
[51:15.30]Can I take his bow?
[51:19.68]I don't think so.
[51:24.02]Promote that guy.
[51:24.88]I know, I really... Seriously.
[51:27.12]Oh, man.
[51:31.70]Okay, combat predator ranged wraith mounted story.
[51:39.70]God, this is a thousand things to do here.
[51:44.42]Alright, but these are locked.
[51:47.57]This is... You have to get execution.
[51:49.27]It's like the most important thing in the whole game.
[51:51.71]When you might as well aim at an enemy with L and then press YB.
[51:55.88]Yep, that's very important to have.
[52:01.36]So can I do anything with this guy?
[52:02.52]Oh, I can just get in his way.
[52:05.06]That was fucking perfect.
[52:08.90]New objective.
[52:11.04]Gear skills.
[52:13.69]What?
[52:17.72]What are you doing?
[52:18.38]What are you talking about?
[52:19.54]Oh, okay.
[52:20.56]We got this.
[52:21.34]This is the Shadows of the Past.
[52:23.84]Let's just go... I want to kill... Let's mark this guy.
[52:27.38]Let's get some information on this guy.
[52:31.61]I've got a couple new things, too.
[52:34.83]Let's get to the menu again.
[52:35.95]Inventory.
[52:39.73]Okay, I got a new dagger.
[52:42.74]This is a... Stealth attack.
[52:45.76]Cool.
[52:46.74]New armor.
[52:48.76]Maximum health up.
[52:51.60]Oh, come on.
[52:51.98]Doesn't even do anything.
[52:52.62]Doesn't even change the way I look.
[52:57.44]Does someone save you every time?
[52:58.92]I don't think so.
[53:00.00]I think that that just... I think that guy, like, happened to be standing in the exact perfect spot where we couldn't see him.
[53:07.44]And then he just deus ex machina.
[53:09.14]Wait, what?
[53:11.72]What are you talking about?
[53:14.56]Controller disconnected.
[53:19.85]Alright, that was weird.
[53:30.52]Wait a minute, my friend!
[53:32.60]No, I have to Deus Ex Machina him!
[53:35.44]Successful attacks gain might.
[53:36.74]Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
[53:38.90]Don't let him die!
[53:40.12]This guy needs to stay alive so he can continue to save my life every time.
[53:48.07]Nice work.
[53:52.93]Got it.
[53:53.51]Alright, you're safe.
[53:55.83]He's like all fucking jazzed up.
[53:57.17]Look at him.
[53:57.43]He's all fucking jacked up.
[54:04.21]Where's he going?
[54:05.05]Oh, he's chasing this guy.
[54:05.89]Alright, I gotta follow him.
[54:06.63]I gotta follow this guy around.
[54:09.03]This is my new best friend.
[54:10.01]That guy just walked into fire.
[54:14.25]I need to know.
[54:14.90]I need information.
[54:16.54]Come here!
[54:22.19]The treasure goblin got away?
[54:23.39]Oh well.
[54:24.55]This is the guy I wanted to tell him.
[54:28.21]He's beast fodder.
[54:29.12]He's scared of beasts.
[54:29.88]He looks kind of like he's scared of cats.
[54:31.70]He looks like he's frail.
[54:33.62]This guy's very frail.
[54:38.96]Alright, see you later.
[54:43.97]Nice work!
[54:44.51]You did it!
[54:48.64]Do you hear this guy's voice?
[54:49.62]I hope this guy talks again.
[54:54.73]This guy has like Demon Lord Zaraxas's voice.
[55:07.73]I wanna hear it.
[55:12.37]Talk!
[55:14.21]talk this guy no no he's up did that other guy touch him that was on fire
[55:44.16]Alright, there was an old video game.
[55:45.60]There was an old video game that I used to play.
[55:48.34]It was, like, it was an embarrassingly terrible fucking game.
[55:51.44]It was a game where it was chess.
[55:53.80]Or checkers.
[55:54.92]It was called, like, Knight Checkers or, like, Knight Chess or something.
[55:58.14]I don't know what it was.
[55:59.78]But it was such a bad game and every time you moved with the knight character, he made that exact same noise.
[56:06.99]He went, every time.
[56:11.38]Anyone know that game?
[56:12.12]Anyone have any idea what the fuck I'm talking about?
[56:13.66]No, it wasn't Family Guy quest.
[56:17.21]It was like the knight chest.
[56:20.23]What am I doing?
[56:21.63]Alright, just go.
[56:22.97]We're gonna go get the information to kill this guy.
[56:29.64]The fucking movement is just outrageous.
[56:31.60]Alright, there he is.
[56:36.34]I love it.
[56:37.30]I love it!
[56:39.98]I fucking love it.
[56:42.74]What are you doing?
[56:43.36]Kill him!
[56:43.94]Kill this guy!
[56:52.89]Something about just fighting and running around, it's just... If you like the last one, you'll probably like this one.
[56:58.79]It's the game with chess as people.
[57:02.79]I mean, yes, but it was for the fucking IBM computers.
[57:07.09]It's not a fucking new game.
[57:08.25]It's not a game that's come out within the last 20 years.
[57:13.29]Such an odd reference that nobody knows.
[57:15.39]I don't even know the right reference because I can't even tell you the right reference.
[57:21.13]Pretty good fucking combo here.
[57:28.48]I love it.
[57:30.12]Fucking wild flailing that guy was just doing.
[57:35.94]No, my combo.
[57:36.98]What is this?
[57:39.56]Life jab.
[57:41.66]What the heck is that?
[57:43.40]Gems.
[57:46.80]Uh... Mined by dwarves and fashioned into jewelry by... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[57:50.20]It takes a master smith to touch its caliber, but it's okay.
[57:52.83]It's a socket.
[57:56.25]Okay.
[58:01.55]Is this just a picture?
[58:03.58]What the fuck was that?
[58:06.18]Doesn't this seem like this is incorrect?
[58:12.63]Okay.
[58:15.81]So here's the guy that I'm trying to kill.
[58:19.60]Where is he?
[58:20.58]This is the guy's banner.
[58:22.38]What?
[58:23.30]I'm fucking going to sneak up behind me and really die.
[58:28.34]I kind of want to die again just to see if I get saved by one of those fucking people.
[58:37.29]The animations are always so good in this game too.
[58:41.99]Like, how the hell did these guys go from making Gotham City imposters to this game?
[58:46.56]I have no idea.
[58:55.26]Coins.
[58:57.03]I feel like touch that banner.
[59:05.59]The double counter, I love it.
[59:12.17]Nice electric slide.
[59:13.35]Alright, let's make this fuck quick.
[59:23.24]Holy shit, what the fuck happened to that guy?
[59:25.61]Why did that guy go so fast?
[59:27.55]Why did that guy go so far?
[59:28.85]That guy was pulled on the other side.
[59:30.69]That was like a Garry's Bond character.
[59:35.63]Alright, I almost got it.
[59:42.62]Almost cleaned it up.
[59:43.42]There it is.
[59:45.78]Right in the back of the head.
[59:47.99]Sliss's gut open.
[59:51.13]Okay, now I can actually look.

[60:32.40]Let's collect the coins.
[60:37.72]And then touch this.
[60:39.88]Apparently he's not over here.
[60:45.35]Investigate the clue.
[60:50.15]This orc endeavors to trap us.
[60:52.61]Let us reward his cunning.
[61:01.28]He's trying to trap us by turning around and running the other direction.
[61:06.90]That was a pretty good trap.
[61:14.69]No, get out of here.
[61:16.87]I touched... No, I don't care about you.
[61:23.40]I care about the fat guy that's running away right now.
[61:29.61]This is the guy's plan?
[61:30.41]No, he's luring me to a trap.
[61:31.77]He's trying to lure me to a trap.
[61:33.31]I get it.
[61:34.39]Like this.
[61:35.73]Well, you just got... You just went into your own trap.
[61:39.49]You're getting attack fight bees.
[61:40.55]Is that what you were trying to do to me?
[61:46.88]There's two traps.
[61:48.52]That I've not been a part of, no.
[61:50.68]Come here, you fucking little shit.
[61:54.22]I gotta lure him over into the traps.
[62:05.29]Stun him!
[62:06.93]Stab him!
[62:08.41]What are you doing?
[62:09.13]That guy didn't even have a fucking cutscene.
[62:13.83]Oh my god, there's like five captains.
[62:15.58]Alright, no, I'm on fire.
[62:17.40]Wait, no!
[62:18.02]Wait, wait, get up here.
[62:22.54]What?
[62:24.08]What are you doing?
[62:28.46]Okay, he killed him.
[62:30.58]He killed him.
[62:32.56]For some reason.
[62:35.83]Alright, we're gonna go up this way.
[62:36.93]I'm gonna hide from this.
[62:39.11]That was insane.
[62:40.65]Is he climbing up here?
[62:42.45]Oh, Jesus.
[62:44.21]Oh, shit.
[62:51.22]Come here.
[62:51.82]Come here.
[62:52.12]Come here.
[62:52.58]Come here.
[62:56.86]They're shooting arrows.
[62:59.74]Oh my god, get me the fuck away from him.
[63:02.92]Is this also a captain?
[63:08.23]I gotta throw this guy off the fucking cliff.
[63:09.33]Get over here.
[63:10.29]Ooh, that was a trip.
[63:11.71]Right in the stomach, c'mon.
[63:27.18]Come on, kill him.
[63:28.52]There's too many captains around here.
[63:30.20]What am I doing over here?
[63:34.59]I'm gonna throw this guy off the cliff so bad.
[63:38.13]Not gonna happen.
[63:42.23]Alright, I have to execute this guy.
[63:46.07]Done.
[63:48.67]Right through the stomach.
[63:50.16]See you later.
[63:54.34]That was fucking cool.
[63:56.02]That was awesome.
[64:00.96]Alright, so... I've killed this guy before.
[64:05.20]I killed this guy before, that's fine.
[64:06.56]Alright, it's like every which way, somebody just keeps coming out of the woodwork.
[64:13.21]How many times do I have to fucking- I just want to get out of here!
[64:21.96]Right in the back.
[64:31.02]I need to cut this guy's head off.
[64:32.72]No, I didn't.
[64:34.28]I just, like, snapped his neck.
[64:37.18]Alright, done.
[64:38.65]I got a lot of XP.
[64:40.61]Give me the gear.
[64:43.37]Ranger!
[64:45.73]Get back, scum!
[64:48.89]Got a new sword.
[64:49.59]Alright, there's gear on the ground over here.
[64:52.01]Alright, make sure there's no other captains, like, hanging out.
[64:57.95]Do you hear this?
[65:03.63]Somebody's just singing.
[65:10.94]Who's doing that?
[65:17.42]Oh, it's these guys down here.
[65:22.13]No, they're just drunk.
[65:35.32]Sorry, I ruined the party.
[65:40.56]Alright, give me this gear.
[65:47.11]New chest.
[65:49.95]What was that?
[65:51.55]I don't know.
[65:51.99]This game's too much fun.
[65:55.29]This is exactly what I remember.
[65:56.49]Oh, well this gives more intel.
[65:58.67]I haven't even done one quest yet.
[65:59.78]Get over here.
[66:02.54]Really?
[66:05.68]Can you please?
[66:06.78]Like, I just need to scramble this guy's brain.
[66:08.36]This guy is not ever gonna make it past this.
[66:11.00]Here we go.
[66:14.95]Okay, um... Why would I be marking the target of my own people?
[66:21.49]Let's go with this one.
[66:25.03]Turns remaining two.
[66:28.18]Mortally vulnerable to execution.
[66:31.30]Soft target.
[66:32.16]Heavily damaged by arrows.
[66:34.60]But enraged by injury.
[66:37.40]Fireproof.
[66:39.22]And has a crossbow.
[66:40.64]Okay.
[66:43.82]Happy I'm having fun?
[66:45.44]I fucking love this game.
[66:49.04]I love, like, the Shadow of Mordor experience.
[66:55.12]Alright, but let, like, let me just... Let's go do the actual quest.
[67:02.36]Supply raid.
[67:03.22]Gondarians are raiding.
[67:04.28]Rug the steady supply.
[67:05.42]Let's go here.
[67:07.02]And then we're gonna go there.
[67:08.60]Sounds like fun.
[67:10.16]Let's do it.
[67:10.76]Sounds like fun.
[67:15.85]They're like looting my fallen comrades.
[67:18.37]Oh, treasure goblin.
[67:19.77]This is what they were talking about, right?
[67:24.29]These guys are all like boxes of gold.
[67:27.99]I hope this is what they were talking about.
[67:29.42]Oh shit, I have too many people here.
[67:40.04]Oh, this is not good.
[67:43.34]Come on, they're holding like caches of supplies.
[67:45.28]How am I supposed to not know?
[67:46.16]Shit, I'm getting, I'm getting, there's too many.
[67:53.68]I'm getting surrounded.
[68:04.15]Where am I going?
[68:05.67]What did I just do?
[68:08.29]That was fucking insane.
[68:09.35]I just like jumped over that guy's head.
[68:10.35]I did like a swan dive over two people.
[68:17.33]Fuck, I lost the combo.
[68:22.77]Just jumping all over the place.
[68:23.93]You know, I used to sit there and play this game.
[68:30.04]And just try to aggro as many people as possible.
[68:32.66]And try to get over like 100, like 200 combo.
[68:34.90]It was so much fun.
[68:37.56]Especially when the new enemies later on get introduced.
[68:41.81]Okay.
[68:42.11]This guy's level 9?
[68:43.45]I don't... Oh, boy.
[68:45.14]Well, I don't think I can fight this guy.
[68:48.16]Hunters keep their distance and attack with thrown spears, but they are weak in close combat.
[68:53.52]Well...
[69:06.59]This guy's kind of just like riding the stick right now.
[69:09.04]Are you going to attack or are you going to fucking like ride the stick?
[69:13.20]Ranger!
[69:14.12]I'm going to sit at fucking range.
[69:15.94]And just like pleasure myself.
[69:19.10]To your demise.
[69:22.34]Ooh, that hurts though.
[69:23.70]That actually really hurts.
[69:26.39]Whoa!
[69:30.77]Whoa!
[69:32.91]Okay, no one to hold him and no one to fold him.
[69:35.63]Oh god damn it, why am I getting on top of the fucking like King Leonidas statue?
[69:40.21]No, get off of this, get off.
[69:44.16]Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, go this way.
[69:49.80]Shit.
[69:50.88]I need to heal.
[69:51.80]I don't know, where is he?
[69:57.42]Does it heal?
[70:07.14]I don't think it heals.
[70:07.68]I have to, like, unlock that, I think.
[70:08.94]Nope.
[70:12.72]It just blew a guy's head up in front of his friends.
[70:14.88]It did kind of heal, didn't it?
[70:15.80]Alright, let's get back to business here.
[70:24.59]Watch out for the spear.
[70:25.51]He's going to throw one.
[70:28.61]Right here.
[70:28.89]Get him.
[70:31.19]Good.
[70:31.43]Nice work.
[70:34.09]He can do the same moves that I can.
[70:37.03]That fucking hurt.
[70:39.33]Keep an eye on the right side of your screen.
[70:40.77]I'm not getting another spear through- He just fucking killed someone.
[70:46.18]Oh god, this is too much.
[70:48.46]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[70:49.88]Alright, here we go.
[70:53.24]No, you- No!
[70:55.60]You fucking idiots.
[70:56.68]Why are you here?
[70:57.77]Why- They weren't- Why were they behind me?
[71:01.39]They weren't even there before.
[71:04.23]My poor deus ex machina.
[71:08.06]Alright, there we go.
[71:08.65]He's fine.
[71:08.93]We're fine.
[71:15.31]Thanks for being the bait.
[71:18.63]He's behind you.
[71:20.47]He's behind, behind, behind, behind.
[71:22.28]God damn it.
[71:38.27]Got him.
[71:40.50]On the head.
[71:42.44]Oh fuck, I'm burning!
[71:45.82]He's still burning, right?
[71:46.90]He's gonna burn.
[71:48.12]Wow!
[71:50.92]No, no, I don't want to be like a midway game.
[71:53.41]Come on.
[71:55.01]I can't go over to him.
[71:55.95]There's this fire in front of him.
[71:57.49]And it's just spreading.
[71:58.55]This place is lighting on fire.
[72:01.29]Oh my god.
[72:04.04]It's spreading to me.
[72:05.60]Don't you understand this, guys?
[72:06.66]This is getting closer to me.
[72:07.94]And I'm going to roll into this accidentally.
[72:13.21]You are so lucky.
[72:17.77]Will you just... Okay, here we go.
[72:35.26]Get fucking destroyed, buddy.
[72:40.34]Smart AI.
[72:44.28]For you.
[72:44.76]For you.
[72:46.06]Oh my god.
[72:46.86]Okay, hold on a second.
[72:48.46]I was in the middle of like an intense couple of battles there.
[72:51.64]Let me just like catch up with the bits.
[72:53.78]Swaggybot, thanks for the five dollars.
[72:55.94]I'm never ever around to donate, but I've always wanted to.
[72:58.45]You're an amazing guy.
[72:59.23]Big fan.
[72:59.59]Stay awesome.
[72:59.99]Well, thank you, Swaggy.
[73:01.51]Thanks for the five bucks.
[73:02.51]Appreciate it.
[73:02.91]Hope you're having a good time.
[73:05.32]Ben, Ben Elnor, gave 50 bucks a little while ago.
[73:11.02]5,000 bits from Ben Elnor.
[73:13.12]I was kind of in tunnel vision playing the game.
[73:15.96]But, thank you so much, Ben.
[73:19.52]More contributions from Ben.
[73:22.65]He's going to get that bit badge.
[73:26.32]It seems like he probably, yeah, I'm sure he probably already has the, at least like the what, the $500 one?
[73:31.78]Jesus.
[73:33.28]Thank you, Ben, though.
[73:34.22]Appreciate it, man.
[73:36.84]Rytanic, thanks for the $5.
[73:38.44]Turian, thanks for the $5.
[73:39.18]I just want to say I was glad to meet you at the My Little Pony movie premiere last night.
[73:44.01]My cosplay was on point.
[73:50.41]Okay.
[73:53.39]Okay.
[73:56.39]750.
[73:56.71]Yeah, I knew it was at least, like, $500.
[73:59.01]At least, like, over the... Because there's one at 500 and one at 1,000, right?
[74:04.12]He read it.
[74:04.56]Well, I don't know.
[74:05.28]I'm just, like, reading.
[74:06.22]I'm just reading the thing that's there.
[74:11.54]Did My Little Pony make a movie?
[74:16.52]I don't even follow any of that shit.
[74:20.56]+2 to that guy.
[74:26.75]No, seriously.
[74:29.63]Fucking My Little Pony.
[74:33.59]Whatever.
[74:35.77]Whatever.
[74:37.39]Thank you, Ultraviolent for the five bucks.
[74:41.33]What is this Assassin's Creed clone next game?
[74:44.33]L-U-L.
[74:45.15]It's not Assassin's Creed.
[74:46.54]It's a Batman Arkham Asylum clone.
[74:48.84]If anything.
[74:49.32]It's made by the same fucking studio, Warner Brothers.
[74:52.72]Or published, whatever.
[74:54.50]But thank you for the five bucks.
[74:56.85]And Darkstar finally turned it out thanks to the $1.
[74:58.93]I think sellout is a nebulous term at this point, but I'm glad the only time you seriously considered selling out was when you could make another rat movie.
[75:06.15]Pretty much.
[75:07.68]I would say pretty much.
[75:10.12]Get this mouse off the screen.
[75:11.20]Alright, let's go.
[75:12.80]Thank you, everybody.
[75:16.32]Assassin's Asylum.
[75:18.50]This game is way more fun than Assassin's Creed.
[75:21.32]Like, I'm sorry, guys.
[75:23.45]Assassin's Creed, I've just never been a fan.
[75:26.57]They made a couple of cool ones, and then they just... Okay, you know how this is kind of Shadow of Mordor again, but just more stuff?
[75:33.74]Imagine if they made this game like seven more times.
[75:38.36]I don't know.
[75:38.86]I'm just not a fan.
[75:40.82]Assassin's Creed 1 and 2 were cool.
[75:42.96]It was an interesting concept, and then they just kept making them.
[75:46.99]It's all good, though.
[75:48.51]You have upgrade skills for... Wait.
[75:50.97]You have upgrades available for some of your skills.
[75:53.49]Only one upgrade can be active at a time, so choose the one that best suits your playstyle.
[76:00.45]Oh, I see.
[76:01.09]Grim Resolve.
[76:04.75]So how do I get over to that?
[76:08.79]There it is.
[76:09.47]Gain might each time you are damaged in combat.
[76:11.57]I mean, that's kind of cool, but I want to spend my point.
[76:14.27]Holding A to sprint no longer creates sound.
[76:18.09]That's pretty cool.
[76:20.09]I do need to get some of these basic things, though.
[76:24.59]That's the dagger throw.
[76:27.51]Shadow strike.
[76:28.57]This is actually pretty important, too.
[76:33.78]Riding on Karagors is important.
[76:38.24]I need this.
[76:39.74]Hold B to recover health by draining the life from orcs.
[76:41.76]I need this one.
[76:42.32]I already have it.
[76:43.90]Okay.
[76:44.97]Oh.
[76:45.99]Right.
[76:47.43]okay this is that you get this from the story right I get it now okay I'm gonna go with the uh shadow strike hold lt plus x to shadow strike into a fire pit detonating it that's like cool I need like that ability and let's keep going what about items 34
[77:17.09]You can also destroy from Mirion, too.
[77:18.58]I'm gonna do that.
[77:21.80]Can I not destroy this?
[77:25.10]I guess this is the only one I can break down.
[77:28.76]Why can't I break this one?
[77:30.99]Because this is the original weapon, right?
[77:36.73]Still have the same gem.
[77:37.75]That's fine.
[77:41.32]New bow.
[77:43.72]New gear.
[77:44.76]It's the exact same thing, but it's blue.
[77:46.46]But I want to wear it because I like blue better than red.
[77:49.42]I think it looks nicer.
[77:55.79]And a new hood.
[77:58.29]This is a new haircut.
[77:59.93]Oh no, it's green.
[78:00.65]Okay, cool.
[78:01.63]Stealth plus four.
[78:02.93]Alright.
[78:08.24]There's a gem behind me.
[78:14.10]Well, this thing's about to be over.
[78:15.58]Shoot ghoul eggs to attract ghouls.
[78:21.16]No.
[78:21.70]Fuck it.
[78:22.18]This event's almost over.
[78:23.62]I gotta get over there.
[78:24.22]See ya.
[78:37.13]I love it.
[78:39.24]Oh, he managed to kill three orcs!
[78:41.86]How could he?
[78:46.68]Let's keep going.
[78:48.04]Rooftop to rooftop.
[78:54.95]Come on, get over there.
[78:55.77]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[79:01.49]Here it is.
[79:03.85]Before it's over.
[79:04.74]Fucking idiot.
[79:13.40]Here we go.
[79:14.66]Supply raid.
[79:15.18]Gondorians are raiding Rug, the city's supply cache.
[79:17.30]Reward 1,300 experience.
[79:21.33]Terrified of Karagors.
[79:23.41]Vulnerable to stealth.
[79:25.09]Day used to buy stealth.
[79:26.99]And he's kind of just like a weakling.
[79:29.97]He's a slayer.
[79:31.40]Extremely skilled.
[79:33.40]That's fine.
[79:33.90]Let's just raid this depot.
[79:38.70]The climbing's worse than Assassin's Creed.
[79:40.20]Nobody touches this stuff!
[79:43.02]I think that's fair.
[79:47.10]Nobody, don't touch this stuff!
[79:49.15]This is the medic from TF2.
[79:50.29]He's in every game, guys.
[80:08.18]Ready, ready!
[80:15.47]Sure thing!
[80:19.81]It's just the fucking TF2 medic.
[80:22.53]Burn him.
[80:23.84]Shoot him in the head.
[80:26.66]He's arrowproof.
[80:27.90]Fuck, I gotta... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[80:29.26]Get out of the way!
[80:30.16]Out of the way!
[80:31.42]Get out of the way!
[80:32.10]You fucking dummy!
[80:32.78]I need to get a headshot kill!
[80:33.74]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't!
[80:34.78]No, no, no!
[80:37.78]I'll still get one.
[80:49.45]Damn it, I didn't get the side objective.
[80:52.29]Ugh.
[80:56.41]Bad guy.
[80:57.01]I had to at least try.
[81:00.43]Ready.
[81:00.95]Ready.
[81:01.27]Steady.
[81:01.69]Rug the Steady was killed defending a supply cache.
[81:03.81]Killed.
[81:04.27]Experience.
[81:05.31]Battle reports.
[81:07.87]Very nice.
[81:08.19]That was very easy.
[81:13.00]Um... A guy walked into the fire.
[81:22.14]Well, you probably shouldn't have gone that way.
[81:23.71]You could...
[81:34.26]Turn around and two more guys are on fire.
[81:38.52]Oh, what a fucking perfect game.
[81:43.34]Press it while sprinting to slide tackle.
[81:49.56]I'm trying to do it.
[81:50.10]Press RT while sprinting to slide tackle.
[81:52.04]Oh, there it is.
[81:52.78]You can do the soccer move that you get, like, a red card for.
[81:56.66]Alright, let's try to get a red card.
[81:58.08]Nope.
[82:05.65]Fuck it.
[82:06.29]I'll do it later.
[82:06.95]I'll do it later.
[82:11.23]Let's go to the actual mission now.
[82:13.60]There we go.
[82:24.18]Mission's over here.
[82:26.54]That diaper run was perfect.
[82:30.83]There we go.
[82:31.89]We're going to jump down there.
[82:32.89]There we go.
[82:38.77]Here's the first, like, actual story mission.
[82:43.95]Good thing there's no fall damage.
[82:44.93]Alright, here we go.
[82:45.63]First, like, actual story.
[82:47.31]Let's read it.
[82:48.41]Read the story.
[82:49.69]Discover Celebrimbor's ancient storehouse and explore the memories of his past struggles with Sauron.
[82:55.28]And you get Elven Rage.
[82:56.22]You get a skill point, you get some money, and here we go.
[83:02.46]Find Celebrimbor's ancient barrows.
[83:08.24]Oh, that's easy.
[83:08.58]They're right here.
[83:09.04]Sprint, sprint, sprint.
[83:12.80]Barrows.
[83:14.26]Maybe get some currency.
[83:15.28]I'm assuming I'm going to unlock that later.
[83:17.73]Find the secret door.
[83:19.47]Fucking Harry Potter bullshit.
[83:22.07]There it is.
[83:42.41]Uh-huh, funny Assassin's Creed joke.
[83:44.11]Ha, hey.
[83:44.99]It's Celebrymbor, not Celebrymbor, like celery.
[83:47.15]No, it's not.
[83:47.79]It's Celebrymbor.
[83:49.93]That's what he says.
[83:51.53]Celebrymbor.
[84:09.41]This is what I have to do.
[84:10.07]Calibrated bing-boing.
[84:11.66]Imagine that was his fucking name.
[84:29.38]It is my desire, calibrated big boing.
[84:32.30]I crafted the rings of fo- Ooh, we get a- Alright.
[84:35.36]Kill enemies to gain wrath.
[84:37.06]When your wrath is full, press up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start to unleash the elven rage.
[84:43.46]During elven rage, tap and repeatedly kill grunt orcs.
[84:46.16]Aim at an enemy captain and hold.
[84:47.49]He adds massive damage.
[84:53.11]I want to look at him.
[84:55.17]He's so fucking cool looking.
[84:57.97]That's my Halloween costume.
[85:05.39]Reach the full wraith before time runs out.
[85:07.57]I can do that.
[85:09.79]I have no execution.
[85:15.34]Who's my wraith lord?
[85:19.60]Wait, I need to get to full wraith.
[85:20.92]Okay.
[85:25.31]Come on, give it a full Wraith.
[85:35.97]Full Wraith form.
[85:39.23]Magnetize to people, it's all good.
[85:45.37]Take his head off.
[85:47.21]No one's there.
[85:51.68]Build the power of the ring.
[85:56.50]I'm trying.
[85:59.00]Almost.
[86:03.40]I only have 30 seconds to do this.
[86:12.05]Doing a lot of blocking.
[86:12.95]I have like 15 seconds.
[86:13.89]What the fuck?
[86:14.37]Come on!
[86:28.87]Power of the Ring.
[86:33.51]What's going on?
[86:35.94]What's happening?
[86:37.68]I'm holding it.
[86:39.10]Oh, you just... Okay, I get it.
[86:40.42]I get it.
[86:43.68]You just have to hold the button and aim in different directions.
[86:49.85]That is weird.
[86:50.55]Okay.
[86:51.29]These are where he fights Sauron.
[87:01.40]So are we supposed to be led to believe that Calibrimbor killed Sauron?
[87:05.06]Or beat him or something?
[87:10.02]No, he pulls the ring off.
[87:11.05]Oh no.
[87:23.13]They look like they're watching a movie screen.
[87:26.17]Yeah, so as you see, according to the film we just watched...
[87:30.90]That cutscene we just watched, I mean, holy shit, can you believe what happened to me?
[87:33.68]This is just fanfiction.
[87:47.89]Unleash the power of the ring.
[87:49.13]I only got a 30%.
[87:49.69]I didn't know that was part of it.
[87:57.11]Relieve the history of the first war from Mordor between Celebrimbor and the Dark Lord by completing that.
[88:03.91]Whatever that is.
[88:04.47]That crumpled up piece of paper.
[88:06.23]Shadow of the Past Memories.
[88:08.49]Completing all the missions grants Bright Lord's Rune.
[88:11.15]Perfecting all the missions grants Bright Lord's Hammer.
[88:15.53]The nine rings of power.
[88:24.84]Italian Doors, Web of Fate, Gondorian Artifacts.
[88:29.60]Main characters.
[88:33.32]Three people.
[88:35.10]Castamere, Dagor, Tyrandor.
[88:39.25]Heroine.
[88:42.31]Alright, this guy's just a drug.
[88:50.00]Sharon.
[88:50.70]We got Sharon and Forthog.
[88:54.65]Orc culture?
[88:55.39]This is like a whole book here.
[89:01.71]I know it was Herion.
[89:02.99]I'm fucking kidding.
[89:03.93]It's a joke.
[89:05.57]What, I'm not allowed to make jokes?
[89:11.15]What, I'm not allowed to... I crafted the rings of power.
[89:17.55]I want to do this one.
[89:19.77]Yeah.
[89:24.83]I'm just messing around.
[89:29.75]It's a joke.
[89:31.15]It's a joke.
[89:32.97]I can do quest.
[89:36.69]Gear, skills, no.
[89:38.27]Fast travel, we can get out of here.
[89:40.59]New, new, new.
[89:42.51]Oh boy, we have to link B in here, don't we?
[89:49.07]Restore the poem to open the door.
[89:53.18]Under siege, find the palantir where the city falls.
[89:55.64]Alright, what is this?
[90:00.88]I don't understand.
[90:04.08]Like, didn't I just do this?
[90:07.85]Yeah, I guess you can try to, like... I guess you can try to, like, Shadow of the Colossus this and just go do each statue.
[90:15.33]Right?
[90:15.67]And then, like, there's where the lady is lying down that you're trying to, like, bring back to life.
[90:22.57]Okay.
[90:24.30]This just is Shadow of the Colossus.
[90:26.18]Shadow of Mordor, Shadow of War, Shadow of the Colossus.
[90:29.10]I know where they fucking got their ideas from.
[90:30.60]Alright, read the poem.
[90:41.64]I just got, like, mad limbs.
[90:43.54]In the land of Mordor where the poop lie, we bear our banners aloft.
[90:49.29]Boots like...
[90:51.25]chicken our Funny quick our conference dire for who in this dark dream haunted mansion dares resist the righteous flame of Trump and Trump themselves to despair Right I'm saying Let's go
[91:28.71]Oh, he said the same thing twice.
[91:32.13]Oh, my God.
[91:32.97]What is this?
[91:35.23]Dude, did you like those political meme jokes I did in my funny Mad Lib?
[91:40.38]Karagors are fearsome predators that pounce on and quickly shred their prey.
[91:44.26]Their deadly jaws protect them from frontal assaults.
[91:47.10]Use your bow to defeat them at a distance or evade their attacks and strike from the side.
[91:57.32]He's just lying there.
[92:06.24]He didn't even do anything.
[92:07.12]Why did I do that?
[92:09.86]It warned me about how he was like a predator and he was going to murder me.
[92:12.39]And then he just like lied down like a cat.
[92:21.67]Okay.
[92:28.48]Shoot him.
[92:29.04]Oh my god, we couldn't... Hold on.
[92:34.39]Not really.
[92:37.75]I'll tell you why.
[92:39.69]Because they kind of already did it.
[92:42.89]Like, Shadow of the Colossus, they remastered it for PlayStation 3.
[92:47.31]And there's really only so much you can do with that, like, engine.
[92:51.02]And I know... Is the PlayStation 4 one, like, a total remaster?
[92:55.58]Or is it just cleaning up textures and putting it on PS4 at 60 frames a second?
[93:00.38]Because I've already... I played Shadow of the Colossus twice now.
[93:04.37]I beat it when it was on PlayStation 2 and beat it when it was on PlayStation 3.
[93:08.39]Like, the redo.
[93:10.95]It's a complete and total remaster.
[93:13.86]But, like... It's still the same exact game, though.
[93:17.90]I mean, look, you can put a fresh coat of paint on it, but I've still played that game, like, beat that game twice.
[93:23.62]That's awesome, obviously for new players and a new generation, new audience.
[93:29.47]I would love people to experience that game.
[93:31.65]But how do you translate some of that game's mechanics to a remaster?
[93:34.63]It might be weird.
[93:36.63]That game was very sloppy.
[93:38.93]But that's why it was fun to play.
[93:40.43]Because of how sloppy the controls were and how weird it was and how hard it was to fight the grip mechanic.
[93:45.14]I feel like they could ruin that if they redo the whole thing.
[93:48.28]They might.
[93:48.74]I don't know.
[93:49.24]We'll see.
[93:54.96]It has optional new controls, apparently.
[93:57.32]Really?
[93:59.50]I'm interested to see what that means.
[94:03.22]Regardless, I definitely support that.
[94:05.55]I think it's cool.
[94:09.85]I'd much rather them remake that than remake Charlie and the Chocolate Factory again.
[94:14.21]You know what I'm saying?
[94:23.60]Alright, um... Let's... I have to, like, find the secrets of Mordor, right?
[94:29.15]So whatever, let's go back.
[94:31.65]I'm gonna fast travel here.
[94:39.93]Alright, let me just make sure.
[94:41.81]But anyways, thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[94:44.61]A Sergeant Pepper Spray.
[94:46.13]Thanks for the $5.
[94:46.65]Hey, Jerma.
[94:48.11]I found out that I lost my house yesterday in the California wildfire.
[94:52.61]It's been tough, but I've been watching your vids to take my mind off things.
[94:55.67]Thanks for being a goofball.
[94:57.58]What?
[94:59.32]Is that... Are you fucking for real?
[95:04.22]Holy shit.
[95:06.34]Um...
[95:08.19]Well, that's... I'm fucking sorry, man.
[95:12.37]That's like... That's fucking terrible.
[95:16.13]Best of luck to you.
[95:16.67]I hope you guys, you and your family, whoever, get through that shit, because that's fucking terrible to hear.
[95:22.32]I'm really sorry about that.
[95:27.20]There was only one situation where I ever... like a natural disaster type shit where I've ever been in, and it was catastrophic.
[95:32.80]It was horrible.
[95:34.89]My old, like, parents' house flooded one time.
[95:38.43]And, like, we didn't, like, lose our house, but, like, there was, like, a foot and a half of water, like, in our, like, downstairs.
[95:44.64]It was, like, ridiculous.
[95:45.80]My mother was, like, crying and shit.
[95:47.02]Like, I can't even imagine what it would be like in that situation where you lose your house.
[95:50.92]Because, like, I've never been able to experience anything that terrible.
[95:55.64]So I'm really sorry to hear that, man.
[96:00.81]But thank you for the $5, though.
[96:02.71]Save that money.
[96:05.34]I told the story on JermaCraft, I did.
[96:08.20]Only a true fan will remember JermaCraft.
[96:13.06]But, yeah.
[96:14.28]Good luck to you.
[96:18.50]Complaining about what?
[96:19.27]No, I'm just saying that, like, I've only come, like, 5% close to something that terrible.
[96:27.15]And even that was horrible for me.
[96:29.07]So I can't even fucking possibly imagine what it must be like.
[96:39.79]Oh god, we gotta get out of here.
[96:43.10]Only 5%.
[96:43.24]Wait, didn't I... Is this a new guy or is this an old guy?
[96:55.00]It keeps wanting me to do that attack and I keep forgetting to do it.
[97:02.67]Have I unlocked the AK-47 from the loot boxes?
[97:05.29]That would be fucking crazy.
[97:09.00]Imagine they made it that stupid.
[97:11.52]You get like a golden AK and just like, not even have to use your weapon.
[97:21.12]But thank you Ben Elnor for 50 bucks.
[97:23.14]You say elf costume fund.
[97:24.40]50 bucks again from Ben.
[97:34.01]Dropping stacks is Ben again.
[97:43.01]Thank you, Ben.
[97:44.23]Thank you for the fucking 50.
[97:45.45]Thank you for the 50, 50, 50, 100, 100, 100, 50, 50, 50 over the last, like, three days.
[97:53.97]You are a monetary god, as they say.
[98:00.99]Thank you.
[98:03.22]What's going on here?
[98:03.92]Why is my heart beating?
[98:07.96]Who's fighting down here?
[98:08.73]Oh, shit.
[98:09.21]There's intel down there.
[98:10.45]Let me get it.
[98:14.45]Don't kill him.
[98:14.99]I need him.
[98:15.47]I need this guy.
[98:18.15]Don't kill him.
[98:25.10]Let's go for this captain up here.
[98:28.24]Why not?
[98:30.31]Pranker the lurker and pranker It's got spears alright fear of flies He's sticky He's really sticky and he's damaged by ranged attacks.
[98:43.22]Let's go Hmm, where is he?
[98:53.18]How is this guy locked?
[99:03.71]How far away is he?
[99:04.67]Let's go back to his... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[99:08.71]Army, there we go.
[99:11.28]Mark him.
[99:11.66]There's this guy too.
[99:14.06]Mark this guy.
[99:14.84]Okay, come on.
[99:20.16]I should be invulnerable for like one second out of the menu.
[99:23.04]So it's basically the same game.
[99:26.14]Basically, up until this point, yes.
[99:28.02]But I think a lot of the changes happen...
[99:31.06]with the base building thing and the sieging.
[99:34.54]That stuff happens probably fairly soon.
[99:36.52]I think they're just trying to, the first few hours, is to get you back into the swing of things.
[99:40.68]Just to get you to remember what it was like to play the game and where to go.
[99:43.36]How to do executions, right?
[99:45.97]They need to, like, teach you how to do that.
[99:47.17]This is way too far away.
[99:54.33]I don't think I want to go after this guy right now.
[99:55.71]Yeah, this is way too far away.
[100:03.61]Let's just do quest.
[100:04.41]The Seeing Stone, Shadows of the Past.
[100:06.51]Okay, the Seeing Stone.
[100:13.34]Didn't it say, can I not open this?
[100:15.24]Until I get like six fucking random stories or something?
[100:20.10]Hold on.
[100:23.16]Okay.
[100:31.32]So, hold on.
[100:32.82]Wasn't there a way for me to, like, use my brain to look and do, like, the hidden object game and find things?
[100:40.82]Is it, like, then it's on the whole map, but... Yeah, but with... I guess I just have to go get this place.
[100:47.16]Okay, I'm gonna go, like, libify, liberate this place.
[100:56.51]I'm gonna go liberate this place.
[101:03.99]It's called thinking I'm standing right next to it.
[101:06.51]Yeah, but if I go in there it's it's locked.
[101:08.55]I can't I can't uh I can't do anything about it.
[101:12.04]The door is locked.
[101:12.68]I could get like six different stones Sprinting is the soldier shoulder charge having trouble tonight
[101:30.56]Alright, let's just go over here.
[101:31.64]I wanna go do this anyways.
[101:33.60]Because.
[101:35.12]Who the fuck are you?
[101:38.96]Why does this guy have a thing on him?
[101:46.52]I don't know why this guy has a thing on him.
[101:51.20]I'm sure I'll find out in a second.
[101:56.37]Oh, he has coin zoning.
[101:58.01]That's what that thing means.
[101:59.07]Tell us about the day you puked on your mother's bed.
[102:07.92]Um... That's like... No.
[102:12.62]Just get here.
[102:18.01]I want to liberate this place first.
[102:21.29]Shoulder tackle.
[102:23.71]You hold...
[102:27.55]What?
[102:29.17]What am I doing?

[103:08.05]View location.
[103:10.51]So what?
[103:16.77]Let's go.

[103:25.36]Pee on his head.
[103:29.05]Let's do this.
[103:30.67]Hold it down.
[103:31.39]Purify it.
[103:33.97]These are the only two in the area, so I'm assuming you just do both of these and unlock some more stuff.
[103:42.64]See?
[103:42.82]Okay, this is what I was talking about.
[103:43.82]So I gotta look around and mark the target.
[103:48.76]There's one.
[103:49.28]So I guess you just have to go around and do these.
[103:55.18]Right?
[103:56.48]I hope that's the case.
[103:58.89]The barrows... There's only two?
[104:04.43]There's another one somewhere.
[104:05.43]There it is.
[104:09.46]Where are you?
[104:10.10]There's another one.
[104:19.25]In the mountains?

[104:28.04]Love this like hot and cold minigame by the way good stuff Okay, let's go get them So I'm gonna go over here Collect all the wait a minute.
[104:46.80]Is there another door?
[104:51.19]But do I have to do those over here I
[104:57.86]Just out of curiosity, hold on a second.
[105:03.95]Is it just for this area?
[105:05.69]There's still one that I didn't do.
[105:09.71]This is the only part of the game that's sort of strange to me.
[105:15.85]It's like, do it in this area and open the door.
[105:17.27]Is it the whole area?
[105:18.27]It has to be the whole area, right?
[105:19.47]But where's this last one?
[105:27.36]Come on.
[105:27.80]Where's this last one?
[105:30.56]Don't do this to me.
[105:31.60]There we go.
[105:32.56]This one's like right behind me.
[105:35.48]Going that way.
[105:39.22]Okay.
[105:39.63]I'm going to go right there.
[105:40.39]And right here.
[105:44.71]Let's go listen to the memory.
[105:53.23]And we move.
[105:56.84]Not somebody dropping that hard in front of you.
[106:01.73]Your walk in the park is fucking ruined.
[106:03.45]See you later.
[106:05.81]You have to do the telescope minigame.
[106:07.33]Yeah, the hot and cold telescope game.
[106:11.98]I assume this is going to be what I need to do.
[106:15.16]I think we're just going to live memories through Celebrimbor for a little while.
[106:20.03]And remember what happened here.
[106:26.70]Find all the Ithildian in this region and return it to the Ithildian to restore the poem.
[106:30.15]Restoring the poem will open the door and grant legendary treasure.
[106:34.59]Or this one.
[106:38.21]Oh boy, okay.
[106:39.97]Where's the other one?
[106:41.29]There are a lot to do.
[106:42.47]Alright, here's another memory.
[106:46.37]Oh, Jesus.
[106:50.69]It really is just everything.
[106:52.98]So there's one, one, two, three, four, five.
[106:56.90]Where's the last one?
[107:02.37]I need five more.
[107:03.27]So I'm standing currently on this Shelob memory bullshit.
[107:10.84]Well, I think I got them all over here, right?
[107:14.36]There's not another one there.
[107:16.46]This is the one I already got.
[107:17.66]There's the door itself.
[107:25.93]I'm gonna go unlock this.
[107:27.03]Might as well get them all unlocked.
[107:35.67]Nope, there's a fucking champion here.
[107:38.55]Champion!
[107:39.41]Right in the head.
[107:43.71]Oh, that hurts.
[107:49.63]Without a doubt.
[107:52.49]Legendary!
[107:53.55]Ah, shit.
[107:57.03]Like, the golden armor.
[107:58.87]Okay.
[108:02.70]Becomes enraged when his health is low.
[108:05.34]Well, that's, like, right now.
[108:09.82]Of course.
[108:13.60]Of course he gains it all back.
[108:24.11]Gonna execute.
[108:24.79]Hopefully he drops up good, though.
[108:27.25]If he's legendary, that means legendary item, right?
[108:30.34]Oh, great.
[108:31.88]Machine tracker.
[108:32.44]Dominate him.
[108:33.00]I don't think I have that yet.
[108:52.63]I wanna, like, grab that.
[108:53.85]I mean, dominating him's not gonna do anything.
[108:56.77]No, not him.
[109:01.89]Yeah, you can't dominate these guys.
[109:03.41]I think you have to be, like, they have to be low, right?
[109:05.07]From what I remember.
[109:06.03]Careful with that trap.
[109:14.36]I'm gonna step in that fucking trap, and it's gonna, I'm gonna be so angry about it.
[109:26.90]Right in the shoulder.
[109:30.27]This can be far... easy, easy, easy.
[109:37.67]Vault Breaker.
[109:42.31]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[109:44.97]Don't lose the combo.
[109:47.51]I can't vault.
[109:48.05]I have to do Dark Souls Dodge to get around this guy.
[109:49.97]That's fine.
[109:58.93]Can he be, like, attacked head on?
[110:00.01]Yeah, he can.
[110:05.74]No!
[110:06.28]That's fine.
[110:07.02]I'd rather just have it not work than nothing.
[110:11.50]No!
[110:11.74]Yeah, stop!
[110:12.32]Stop doing that!
[110:13.14]Stop trying to jump into him, you fucking dummy.
[110:17.53]Oh!
[110:19.99]Wow!
[110:21.45]What the fuck?
[110:34.49]That guy unloaded a fucking barrage on me.
[110:36.93]I don't have any more fucking elf shot.
[110:41.69]There he goes again.
[110:43.59]No!
[110:47.99]And I fucking... No, shit.
[110:52.29]I gotta separate these guys.
[110:53.43]Fuck!
[110:55.76]These guys both have like the perfect shit to counter me.
[111:00.14]I can't jump over this guy.
[111:01.30]This guy's blind.
[111:02.38]Why are you blind?
[111:09.13]This guy's putting the traps down.
[111:13.77]I can't attack you head on because this guy's going to barrage me.
[111:22.12]Get this one random dickhead out of here, please.
[111:24.34]Ugh.
[111:30.61]I'm so paranoid about this guy throwing it.
[111:32.21]There it is.
[111:34.85]It does so much damage.
[111:36.01]I wish I could just let go of him.
[111:41.09]Oh my god!
[111:41.45]I think I lose here.
[111:42.26]Yeah, it's over.
[111:43.22]I'm dead.
[111:55.92]Alright, well that's my first death, okay Runs to kill you a promoter the captain.
[112:13.85]Yeah.
[112:14.19]Yeah.

[112:30.00]Yeah, I gotta claim my revenge.
[112:37.74]That's fine.
[112:43.44]He got the gold.
[112:44.08]Yeah, that guy's the guy that got the gold AK.
[112:46.62]Out of his loot box.

[112:53.57]I'm killing this guy immediately.
[112:54.67]Like, right now.
[112:58.19]Let me just, like, I didn't get a chance to even see what the fuck this guy did.
[113:04.68]Why does my controller keep unplugging?
[113:06.04]What the fuck are you doing?
[113:08.80]Okay.
[113:10.48]I'm gonna get intel on this guy.
[113:12.10]So I can know what he does.
[113:18.86]Vanish from death.
[113:19.58]Yeah, nemesis missions resolve.
[113:22.03]And the victorious captains level up.
[113:23.59]New nemesis missions begin and any vacancies in the army menu may be filled.
[113:28.78]Nemesis missions are active for a limited time.
[113:30.68]Whenever time advances, the counter below the mission decreases.
[113:33.76]When it expires, the mission is automatically resolved.
[113:36.25]Okay.
[113:38.91]Well, I need to find a worm because I want to find out what his weaknesses are.
[113:46.55]You're not kidding.
[113:47.15]I need to pay to get the real ending?
[113:50.43]What?
[113:51.41]It's not, what is it, like locked?
[113:52.79]Is the ending DLC?
[113:57.43]Where's a worm?
[113:59.21]Some random asshole.
[114:00.15]Come on.
[114:03.39]That's not the right way.
[114:04.19]I can still purify this.
[114:07.34]There's one right here.
[114:15.82]Come here, buddy.
[114:17.70]I've got a bone to pick with you.
[114:24.59]Yeah, this guy.
[114:25.41]No, not that guy.
[114:26.73]This guy, please.
[114:32.99]What are his weaknesses?
[114:33.61]Couldn't tell.
[114:40.35]Heavily damaged by beasts.
[114:42.49]Damage by range, damage by executions.
[114:44.21]Alright, I need to like, learn, I need to level up to Karagor, if I can get a Karagor and come back to this guy.
[114:52.44]And there's somebody behind me.
[114:53.90]It's this fucking dumb hammer guy again.
[114:55.40]Alright, you know, you, you ain't gonna fuck with me this time.
[114:57.90]This asshole.
[114:58.56]It becomes an ongoing grind.
[115:00.60]Fuck, I was trying to dodge a round.
[115:11.96]There's so many people in here too.
[115:16.56]Oh fuck, I'm in trouble here.
[115:17.82]Oh, there's a lot of humans in here!
[115:22.40]They're not even humans, they're orcs!
[115:29.10]Lotta humans!
[115:34.99]Throwing fucking spears at me, that's fine.
[115:44.50]Get me in the right spot.
[115:46.04]Just keep the combo going.
[115:53.16]Don't get too close, because I will fall.
[115:54.92]I hate those traps, because I want to just dodge around.
[116:00.94]Try in the back.
[116:16.42]Don't step in the trap.
[116:18.72]What hit me?
[116:19.18]Come on.
[116:23.31]Come on.
[116:26.91]No!
[116:27.23]That was close.
[116:28.77]I just barely didn't get hit by that, so I'm off.
[116:44.48]Get it.
[116:45.48]Get it.
[116:45.86]He needs one hit.
[116:49.95]Got him.
[116:53.87]That's a lot of orcs.
[116:56.25]Yes, it is.
[117:00.21]But they lose morale once the captain's dead and a lot of them run away.
[117:07.66]There are too many, though.
[117:08.68]Yes, I will agree.
[117:09.82]There are a little too many.
[117:11.36]Nothing I can't handle.
[117:17.94]I hope you're having fun because we're suffering.
[117:20.28]What?
[117:22.64]What do you mean you're suffering?

[120:12.22]That's what I want.
[120:14.58]Still have another point, so we're going to go... Shoot fire pits.
[120:21.28]RT to detonate them without shadow striking them.
[120:23.56]That's a pretty big deal.
[120:26.48]Although I do like this.
[120:28.57]Sprinting.
[120:28.97]Silent sprinting.
[120:31.03]Helps a lot.
[120:34.55]It just does.
[120:35.33]Now I can break Karagors.
[120:38.07]I have an inventory now where I can look at it.
[120:42.49]New dagger.
[120:42.99]210.
[120:43.39]Stealth attack.
[120:44.83]Ranger's dagger.
[120:45.59]Let's break down the other ones.
[120:51.41]New bow.
[120:55.43]Doesn't do anything.
[121:00.56]And that's it.
[121:02.62]Okay.
[121:04.72]War chest.
[121:05.36]Is this what they were talking about?
[121:09.48]Now let me...
[121:12.95]Get this.
[121:14.37]Another memory of Isildur.
[121:17.47]Here's our latest memory of Isildur.
[121:23.40]Get on the light post.
[121:25.96]Move forward.
[121:26.64]Here we go.
[121:26.90]Let's go.
[121:29.73]It's Wednesday now.
[121:30.65]What do you mean it's Wednesday?
[121:31.73]Not yet.
[121:32.43]Almost Wednesday.
[121:46.59]Jesus.
[121:47.21]OK, well, that just happened.
[121:51.86]Go.
[121:52.24]What are you doing?
[121:53.70]I can't jump over the fucking water?
[121:57.52]Apparently, I cannot jump over the water.
[122:07.77]I like that backstab thing.
[122:09.01]That's awesome.
[122:13.67]This way.
[122:16.17]Go around.
[122:16.95]Let's get this new memory and unlock the actual video game.
[122:20.45]How long is this game?
[122:21.33]This game's probably fucking a thousand leagues.
[122:28.14]Alright, remember.
[122:29.98]Drag around until you find it.
[122:33.28]That's it.
[122:37.02]Where's the closest one after that?
[122:38.94]Hmm.
[122:43.65]Let's go kill this guy.
[122:44.49]He's right here.
[122:49.05]If I go up to the top of this, can I... Yes, I can.
[122:55.53]Do I have any intel on this guy?
[123:01.87]I don't think so.
[123:02.47]Okay, he's immune to attacks from beasts.
[123:06.42]That don't matter.
[123:08.89]Pretty sure I could probably just, like, get behind him and kill him.
[123:11.71]Who's with him?
[123:12.69]He's got two guys there.
[123:15.67]Wait till he turns around.
[123:16.43]He's level six.
[123:17.75]This guy's dumb.
[123:26.92]No, he's gonna... No, no, turn around.
[123:31.23]I'm gonna ring around in the rosy, this guy.
[123:34.49]Which way is he gonna go?
[123:35.07]Left or right?
[123:40.83]Idiot.
[123:43.21]Got him.
[123:44.77]Don't even let him talk.
[123:46.67]Don't even let him talk.
[123:47.43]Insta-kill him.
[123:48.17]Don't even let him say his, like, dumb fucking... Oh.
[123:51.11]...or laid in its cold grasp on the battlefield until a squirming, wriggling warmth took over me.
[124:02.16]Thousand, thousand.
[124:03.26]Thousand, thousand pulsing maggots crawled over and into me, scouring the dead flesh from my ragged wounds.
[124:15.35]It's a long story.
[124:16.05]Now they are with me, always.
[124:19.01]A churning, writhing horde of doormen.
[124:27.67]Let me end that for you.
[124:30.09]You Shakespearean play dickhead.
[124:34.91]Bye.
[124:35.21]Go back to like a fucking 1930s fucking plays, buddy.
[124:37.89]Shove Shakespeare up your ass.
[124:39.67]Shakespeare wasn't even a real guy.
[124:55.87]You know that?
[124:57.39]Are you guys even aware of that?
[124:59.29]Shakespeare's not even, wasn't even, it was a bunch, it was like four people that pretended this guy was like real.
[125:04.98]Shakespeare's not a real person.
[125:06.34]William Shakespeare does not exist.
[125:11.34]Like two or three different playwrights and like random producers like made this guy up.
[125:16.87]And it was like a fake character.
[125:19.63]That's not confirmed.
[125:20.57]It is in my mind.
[125:22.67]It is confirmed for me.
[125:33.04]How are you still alive?
[125:34.30]What?
[125:35.82]Oh.
[125:38.98]What am I doing?
[125:46.48]Okay, well, forget that.
[125:47.68]Forget I just did that at all, okay?
[125:53.02]This guy is currently a captain.
[125:59.86]uh get him get him get him get him don't let him talk right in the back of the back that's not as fake that's not fake they made a whole movie about that guys would put on wigs and mustaches and go out and talk to crowds pretending to be William Shakespeare it was like six guys it was like tony clifton Andy kaufman had like three characters he pretended to be
[126:23.24]You know, there was two guys that pretended to be Tony Clifton.
[126:26.04]Andy Kaufman and his manager.
[126:27.51]It's the same scenario.
[126:28.37]It was a made-up person.
[126:29.99]They just weren't smart enough or intelligent enough to write this shit down in a book that it was a character played by four guys.
[126:35.29]And that's all I gotta say about that.
[126:44.07]It was a Hollywood film.
[126:45.69]All movies are real.
[126:48.07]What was the name of the movie?
[126:50.34]They made a movie about Superman, too.
[126:52.04]And guess what?
[126:52.58]Superman... You know what I also heard?
[126:54.34]Let me run this by you guys.
[126:55.72]What do you think?
[126:56.08]There's like a conspiracy going around that the actual year... What the hell was that?
[126:58.07]What?
[126:58.19]Alright, there's a conspiracy going around that the actual year we are living in right now is like 1720.
[127:07.61]Anybody hear about this?
[127:18.02]That, like, Hollywood and, like, the governments and the media and everybody, like, made up the Middle Ages.
[127:25.32]It wasn't real.
[127:26.02]Like, we're actually living in, like, the year 1720.
[127:28.30]Anybody hear this one?
[127:31.81]I don't believe it.
[127:32.89]Everyone's calling me, like, a moron.
[127:34.65]I don't believe this.
[127:35.85]I'm just saying it's, like, a thing people are saying.
[127:39.53]That's why I said, did you hear about the conspiracy theory?
[127:42.03]Not, hey, guys, do you want to hear something I believe?
[127:45.57]That's not how I prefaced this conversation.
[127:52.65]What?
[127:52.87]Alright, what am I doing?
[127:57.71]I gotta go get the seal door.
[128:02.15]There's four more.
[128:02.99]Here's one right here.
[128:06.79]But I believe Shakespeare is... No, I don't!
[128:09.69]When did I say that?
[128:10.65]I just simply stated it.
[128:11.81]Have you guys seen this?
[128:12.79]Have you guys heard about this?
[128:14.27]That's it.
[128:16.80]We can't even have a conversation, I have to believe everything that I'm saying as like a point of conversational pieces?
[128:24.96]Don't be a crazed maniac like this guy.
[128:27.80]Funny thing is guys, who am I talking about in that situation?
[128:34.99]Could've been me, could've been the orc.
[128:37.01]Don't believe everything you see on fucking TV.
[128:40.09]Could be fucking not real, William Shakespeare was born in 1621.
[128:53.80]Try to get more intel on you.
[128:58.19]Shag.
[129:03.55]Jerma's in a weird place.
[129:04.55]What?
[129:04.81]I'm just fucking around.
[129:05.61]I'm just having fun.
[129:07.81]This guy's very clumsy.
[129:08.79]He's vulnerable to stealth and he can be grabbed or mounted without first being weakened.
[129:17.04]Interesting way to word that.
[129:19.88]Okay.
[129:20.90]Mounted.
[129:22.48]I can ride on this guy's shoulders?
[129:24.24]I can be injured by ranged attacks, okay.
[129:33.03]You can ride on that guy's back.
[129:34.37]Whose arrow is that?
[129:35.51]I didn't do that.
[129:38.41]Did I shoot this guy in the head with an arrow?
[129:39.81]I don't think so.
[129:43.21]Let's go uncover the truth.
[129:50.25]Wounded.
[129:54.65]I really was wishing this guy was taking a piss.
[129:58.17]I was hoping I could hit him in midair.
[130:04.97]Aerial stealth kill.
[130:06.55]You actually can do it, can you?
[130:10.08]Let's test the theory here.
[130:11.02]Come on.
[130:15.68]No, I don't think so.
[130:24.47]Yeah, you're going to... Alright, Karagor.
[130:26.33]I need to break a Karagor.
[130:27.55]Because I want to go after that guy.
[130:29.69]So let's break this Karagor.
[130:30.73]Let's open up the gate.
[130:33.05]Here he comes.
[130:34.83]Damage a Karagor to break it.
[130:45.64]Oh no!
[130:46.58]A Karagor!
[130:47.72]Okay, we're broken now.
[130:53.28]Got him.
[130:53.62]And here we go.
[130:55.03]Mounted Combat Karagors.
[130:56.29]Combat press X to attack to gain might.
[130:58.61]Devour enemy who's been knocked down.
[130:59.91]Devouring enemies restores your mount's health.
[131:02.85]When you might as well, you can execute or howl to summon additional Karagors.
[131:09.66]Eat him.
[131:11.72]Rip his leg off.
[131:21.16]I feel like I'm doing much more damage with this thing than I was back in the old game with the Karagor.
[131:28.37]Alright, let me do this first because I want to go get my revenge.
[131:33.29]Where is he?
[131:35.53]Where is this guy?
[131:37.95]Mark him.
[131:39.89]And where are you?
[131:42.21]Whoops, this way.
[131:45.15]Is that him?
[131:46.41]There he is.
[131:47.23]Vendetta.
[131:48.57]Hoorah, the legend killed you.
[131:49.83]Complete your vendetta at his feast to receive higher quality gear.
[131:54.08]Let's go fuck this guy up.
[131:56.04]I'm taking the Karagor.
[131:56.96]He's afraid of Karagors.
[132:00.16]I'm gonna go interrupt this guy's Thanksgiving dinner.
[132:03.60]I'm gonna go interrupt fucking William Shakespeare's Last Supper.
[132:09.36]Stick my spear in his face.
[132:11.97]Wow.
[132:19.69]This is his feast?
[132:21.09]Huh?
[132:21.39]There's nobody here.
[132:28.71]This is the feast.
[132:29.57]What feast?

[133:15.04]Come here Don't run away from me
[133:19.65]Search the outpost.
[133:20.45]Alright, let's drop down on this guy.
[133:23.55]Let's get in a stealthy position.
[133:29.65]It's kind of hard to stealth with one of the gargoyles from fucking Ghostbusters, but you know, whatever.
[133:37.39]That's not him.
[133:40.49]Where is he?
[133:41.87]There he is.
[133:44.43]There's Hoorah.
[133:49.82]Shit What where did you come?
[133:56.60]Why are you up here?
[133:59.62]What is this guy here?
[134:00.86]There's no reason for this guy to be here.
[134:03.94]Oh God damn it.
[134:05.08]Hope you're not afraid.
[134:05.72]Hope you're afraid eat him Don't kill this beast.
[134:13.45]It's very important that this thing stays alive.
[134:15.17]Oh
[134:22.50]What?
[134:23.14]There's another Karagor here.
[134:25.08]More Karagors.
[134:25.70]Summon them.
[134:28.44]Summon another Karagor.
[134:29.38]I just did.
[134:43.47]Eat him!
[134:44.25]Eat this motherfucker!
[134:47.25]I just teleported through time to fucking eat that guy.
[134:52.78]That was fucking crazy.
[134:54.48]My brain hurt from that one.
[134:55.54]Alright, he's dead.
[134:58.02]Pick up that shit.
[134:59.41]Don't run away.
[135:02.15]Come with me.
[135:04.31]Alright, how many characters am I gonna bring to this fucking feast?
[135:08.55]More than a few?

[135:24.00]I can't go that way.
[135:25.00]I got to bring the pack somewhere.
[135:32.29]I'm going to try to bring like 10.
[135:33.33]I got two.
[135:38.11]Come down here then.
[135:42.83]There's another Karagor in here, right?
[135:52.32]Fucking Karagor party.
[135:55.20]Bring another one in.
[136:02.96]Interrupt the fucking dinner.
[136:07.43]This is just an absolute massacre.
[136:11.95]I got two Karagors with me.
[136:13.17]Make sure nobody dies.
[136:14.55]Keep everybody alive here.
[136:15.75]This guy's gonna die.
[136:20.27]I killed him.
[136:21.47]It's alright.
[136:21.75]Let's get another one here.
[136:27.69]Follow me.

[138:14.22]I just keep calling in guys.

[138:20.26]Elven Rage, do it!
[138:29.35]There he is, there he is, there he is.
[138:30.39]Get it again.
[138:33.90]I got ambushed by this guy.
[138:36.00]What the fuck?
[138:37.86]Do I have another Karagor?
[138:44.81]New enemy.
[138:45.61]Savages.
[138:46.37]Savages counter normal attacks from the front.
[138:48.19]Press B to stun them.
[138:50.21]Fantastic.
[138:54.08]I got a gem.
[138:57.84]Something to explode.
[139:01.35]And that's how you fucking see fireworks, ladies and gentlemen.
[139:08.31]I'll show you fucking fireworks.
[139:12.57]I get revenge.
[139:15.95]I will show you revenge.
[139:18.77]Just like in that fucking smog movie.
[139:24.22]Those are just regular barrels.
[139:25.18]Fuck.
[139:30.08]Fuck.
[139:41.98]Come on!
[139:43.24]I can't attack that guy from the front.
[139:44.56]It's gotta be an execution.
[139:46.66]And of course I hit him right in the fucking face.
[139:48.34]I'm trying to hit the dumb little grunt next to him.
[139:52.73]He does like a charge mechanic.
[139:53.87]That guy's half health.
[140:00.49]I gotta get a charge attack here.
[140:05.80]Come on, get me in there.
[140:06.92]Get me in there!
[140:07.96]Wow!
[140:11.19]Come on, give me an execution for Christ's sake!
[140:15.49]He's dead.
[140:16.77]One more hit, just hit him.
[140:18.41]Oh, you fucking asshole.
[140:19.53]I don't have any elf shot.
[140:23.30]Oh, that's just wonderful.
[140:31.08]This fucking ballerina, leave me alone!
[140:35.56]Oh my god!
[140:37.46]This guy just doesn't stop!
[140:38.72]Just stop attacking for one second, please!
[140:43.18]He won't stop it!
[140:47.08]Just stop it!
[140:48.28]Oh my god, fucking stop it!
[140:53.96]I'm overwhelmed, I know.
[140:55.16]But I just need to attack this guy one more fucking time.

[141:48.90]No, I don't.
[141:49.42]Oh, fuck.
[141:51.70]Oh, fuck.
[141:54.16]Go through the trees.
[141:56.28]What is this?
[142:07.06]No, don't!
[142:07.60]This is not the time to look at items in the fu- Let me look at the fucking bounty menu!
[142:16.52]Get the fuck out of my way.
[142:17.50]I wish I had a fucking Karagor.
[142:24.30]I need arrows.
[142:25.12]There's an arrow over here.
[142:28.32]Right there.
[142:31.57]Give me them.
[142:32.69]Oh, you dumb fucking grunt.
[142:34.09]Get out of the way.
[142:36.96]Okay, here we go.
[142:38.56]And this is what I'm doing.
[142:39.91]This is what I'm doing.
[142:40.45]This is why I did it.
[142:46.21]Oh, fuck.
[142:46.63]I'm on fire, too.
[142:52.19]Grab this guy over here, and I'm going to drain the guy that's right next to me.
[142:54.69]Damn it.
[142:59.98]No, I'm not.
[143:00.32]I'm going to go around.
[143:03.76]Oh, no.
[143:04.86]There's another guy there.
[143:07.46]Who is that?
[143:07.82]I don't even know what just happened.
[143:10.30]I just mind-controlled a rat.
[143:12.54]I just mind-controlled a rat.
[143:13.86]That's fine.
[143:14.40]Okay, so I have a rat friend.
[143:17.32]I just healed from doing that.
[143:19.58]Where is he?
[143:22.86]Oh, fuck you.
[143:30.07]Alright, he's kind of... He's a little bit...
[143:34.34]There's a little bit.
[143:37.46]Here we go.
[143:37.86]Let's go.
[143:38.18]Trip him.
[143:38.48]He's on the ground here.
[143:40.70]Let's clear it out a little bit.
[143:44.98]Ah, I wanted to use it on him.
[144:04.62]Now there's another champion here.
[144:07.98]What a disaster.
[144:10.13]Not quite.
[144:11.51]Not quite.
[144:11.93]Come on.
[144:20.57]Come on.
[144:22.71]Get it.
[144:23.83]Oh, shit.
[144:24.73]What?
[144:26.09]Enraged by mortal wounds.
[144:27.45]Oh, no.
[144:31.20]Come on.
[144:31.46]I got to make it count just like smog.
[144:33.58]Got it.
[144:37.73]Oh, okay.
[144:38.89]Good.
[144:39.03]He's dead.
[144:39.35]He's dead.
[144:40.11]He's dead.
[144:40.87]Give me the fucking magic hood.
[144:42.63]I can't believe these guys are still around.
[144:55.40]What?
[144:56.00]For a second, I thought that guy, the guy I just killed, came back already immediately.
[145:04.50]I need to get that before it disappears.
[145:06.54]Before I lose.
[145:07.26]Give me the item.
[145:14.00]It's like a rare item.
[145:14.87]I need it.
[145:15.55]I need it.
[145:16.09]Couple of kills here.
[145:27.93]Put his brain arrows on me.
[145:29.05]Alright, just get it.
[145:31.77]Just pick up the fucking item.
[145:33.09]Did I get it?
[145:33.55]Okay, I got it.
[145:35.65]Raider's cloak.
[145:37.73]Fine.
[145:38.29]Finally, Hickam's one of my boys.
[145:40.19]Two of my boys!
[145:47.75]Okay, what is he doing?
[145:51.02]That's new.
[145:53.40]Can I not attack him?
[145:57.17]I guess he, like, can phase through or something?
[145:59.15]That's weird.
[146:05.05]I gotta get rid of this guy, and then I'm outta here.
[146:10.64]One more execution should bring it down.
[146:14.84]One more.
[146:16.18]I don't... Oh, he's retreating.
[146:18.10]Okay.
[146:33.58]I just, like, tackled that guy down a hill on flat surfaces.
[146:37.26]Just kill him.
[146:41.18]That was, like, a dirty play.
[146:42.58]I feel like I'm playing football.
[146:48.20]That's it.
[146:48.74]Alright, got it.
[146:50.02]I got my revenge.
[146:54.34]Got my revenge.
[146:55.30]Time to move on.
[146:55.94]Uh, climb over that, you dummy.
[147:01.00]That was fun.
[147:01.54]That was a rush.
[147:02.10]That was a good game.
[147:03.88]It is a good game.
[147:05.92]Legendary weapons and armor are among the most powerful items in Mordor.
[147:08.64]A legendary item's special properties are active immediately.
[147:11.78]Completing challenges with the item equipped allows you to increase its level, further increasing its power.
[147:18.54]That took 30 minutes.
[147:19.40]Well, that's what you do.
[147:19.96]You just kind of do whatever.
[147:22.65]Unlike rare and epic gear, a piece of legendary gear can be upgraded multiple times until it reaches max level.
[147:29.77]Oh god.
[147:32.39]Huh?
[147:33.87]Legendary gear also comes in sets.
[147:35.83]Equipping multiple pieces of the same legendary gear set unlocks even greater bonuses.
[147:43.23]You can view legendary gear sets, their bonuses, and your progress toward completing challenges in the legendary sets section of the menu item.
[147:50.91]That's 54 sets.
[147:55.47]Okay, well, hold on.
[148:01.01]The Marauder.
[148:02.67]Set bonus one to two, picking up coins increases damage by 2% per coin gained for 20 seconds.
[148:11.24]Okay, well I have this on already.
[148:12.38]10 stealth, let's destroy these.
[148:25.60]Raider's Cloak, okay.
[148:26.98]Level 20 upgrade challenge.
[148:30.35]Enemies killed by beast attacks have a 22% increased chance of dropping coins.
[148:35.93]50% increased damage dealt by beast allies.
[148:39.17]Well, I know what I'm going to have to be doing from now on.
[148:44.12]And one, recruit an orc from the Moor Marauder tribe that is level 20 or higher.
[148:50.22]Okay.
[148:55.97]break this other shit down.
[148:59.51]When are we gonna get to the real game?
[149:00.82]Ah.
[149:02.16]This kind of is the real game.
[149:07.70]This is like the reason to play it, at least.
[149:09.26]34, 34.
[149:11.32]Oh, I already did.
[149:16.45]I did get another gem, though.
[149:17.59]Okay, yeah, I can unlock.
[149:21.71]Mm-hmm.
[149:23.49]It's a thousand coins to unlock the Sloth of the Dagger.
[149:25.63]I kind of want to unlock it for the bow.
[149:27.79]10% increased damage with this weapon.
[149:34.38]I like shooting people in the head.
[149:35.44]You know what I mean?
[149:36.72]Like from a bow perspective.
[149:45.05]I love to use the bow in this game.
[149:49.34]Oh boy.
[149:49.74]I actually have skill to unlock.
[149:51.96]I have one skill point to use.
[149:58.51]I'm just gonna get it.
[150:00.77]What's the point of not having it?
[150:03.05]Alright, so where is the last couple of... There's one here and one here.
[150:14.78]Literally just get this one.
[150:15.74]I can just fast travel here.
[150:17.30]Oh no.
[150:19.41]It's right behind me.
[150:20.17]I mean, just give me a second to heal before I go get it.
[150:30.29]The tutorial of the game is spread throughout gameplay, so you're kind of in the tutorial for like five hours.
[150:36.06]Yeah, I mean, well, this is like a huge game.
[150:39.34]It's not, you know, it's not like a fucking eight-hour experience.
[150:51.61]$89 for this, what?
[150:56.21]I wonder when the micro transactions actually start to play like a significant role.
[151:02.86]Who's with the sweet?
[151:05.78]Be killed instantly with a stealth attack.
[151:13.46]I mean, I think it's fun.
[151:19.02]If you liked the first game, it's just kind of more of the first game, it seems.
[151:22.28]But we haven't even gotten into the big base sieges yet.
[151:25.40]I mean, those are... It's underneath.
[151:32.16]That's a very large... I mean, it's called Shadow of War.
[151:35.22]This game's about... This game, from my understanding, essentially, it's about, like, fighting in wars with hundreds of enemies on the screen.
[151:42.16]Alright, let me remember this while I get attacked from behind.
[151:59.82]Where is the next one?
[152:01.14]It's pretty close, right?
[152:02.76]Just travel.
[152:03.52]I can't fast travel.
[152:04.38]Fuck.
[152:07.59]Move.
[152:14.77]Interesting analysis.
[152:17.31]Well, I'm not analyzing the game right now.
[152:20.68]I'm just playing it.
[152:26.06]This way.
[152:26.64]Did the Superman run?
[152:29.16]There's a guy- there's something going on right here.
[152:31.90]What is this?
[152:41.44]Who are you?
[152:42.00]Alright, well.
[152:43.48]Oh, Jesus.
[152:58.29]Oh, you're mine now, love.
[153:01.35]Forever.
[153:02.95]And ever.
[153:04.47]He's obsessed.
[153:06.25]And ever.
[153:07.82]Bulg, the obsessed.
[153:10.48]There's another guy right here, too.
[153:15.38]Is this fat guy with the fry tuck haircut the other guy that I need to fight?
[153:18.82]I'm pretty sure that's the... No, it's not.
[153:36.45]I just, like, faked him out.
[153:43.47]Huh?
[153:43.79]Whoa, okay.
[153:46.13]So it seems like they actually gave the orcs, the champions at least, real moves.
[153:54.48]Rather than just being stronger versions of... There it is again.
[153:58.74]Choke him out.
[154:09.79]What can the magician move?
[154:11.35]He just teleported in an easier place for me to get him.
[154:19.41]No, I want to shoulder tackle him.
[154:22.98]Not this.
[154:23.58]I want to shoulder tackle him.
[154:26.80]Oh my god, will you fucking stop this nonsense?
[154:30.12]I kind of do.
[154:37.09]I want to dominate him.
[154:39.77]Like I said, I'm not in the stage of the game yet where I can actually dominate people.
[154:44.91]He's immune to execution.
[154:48.99]That's fine.
[154:52.23]I'll just trickshot him.
[154:58.68]Pick up his item.
[155:02.00]Dagger, cool.
[155:07.98]Alright.
[155:09.06]I'm already at this one, so I might as well do it.
[155:21.06]That was way too dramatic for one random guy.
[155:26.61]Alright.
[155:27.85]Where is this one?
[155:28.59]It's up here, I think.
[155:30.17]Up this side.
[155:30.89]Yeah, it's up here.
[155:42.35]Right there.
[155:46.31]Can I just get intel from this guy, like, from up here?
[155:49.77]Apparently I can.
[155:53.84]I killed my lover?
[155:55.18]That's not my lover.
[155:56.02]That's like a random psycho that is obsessed with me and won't leave me alone.
[156:02.11]Schooner.
[156:11.56]Alright, let's go investigate the skin of Rorschach.
[156:19.30]Two more.
[156:21.56]I don't need Elven Rage right now.
[156:27.71]Last one, right?
[156:28.61]There's only one more, I think.
[156:33.53]Ben came back from his milk trip and gave $50.
[156:36.61]That's like a $300 milk.
[156:40.11]You missed that one, try another.
[156:42.68]Well, thank you for the $50, Ben.
[156:47.38]That's $50 and he's got the... He's there.
[156:51.94]There he is.
[156:52.40]I need that money for food.
[156:55.58]You need that money for milk, Ben.
[157:01.87]Think of how many milks you could buy with $50.
[157:03.41]You could buy like at least... You could buy like 40 milks.
[157:07.56]No.
[157:07.72]How many milks could you actually buy?
[157:09.02]It's like two to... It's like what?
[157:10.38]Like three bucks a gallon for milk?
[157:12.30]Three, six, nine, twelve, fifteen, eighteen, twenty-one, twenty-four, twenty-seven, thirty.
[157:16.05]You could buy like sixteen milks.
[157:21.43]I learned another shout.
[157:24.29]It's like three bucks, isn't it?
[157:29.94]It's eighty cents a quart.
[157:31.02]What?
[157:32.02]Where are you getting your milk from?
[157:35.24]My milk is way more expensive than eighty cents a quart.
[157:38.31]I'd like to meet your milk vendor.
[157:43.47]But, thank you.
[157:45.37]All jokes aside, thanks a lot, man.
[157:46.99]Thank you for the massive amounts of money over the last, like, week.
[157:50.73]Look, I want to see something here.
[157:51.73]Hold on.
[157:53.35]Oh, boy.
[157:53.87]You actually do, like, explode them.
[157:55.56]That's so sad.
[157:56.38]Let's fill this guy full of knives.
[158:08.86]That was terrible.
[158:12.48]That guy just, that guy wanted to die.
[158:15.14]Champion down here.
[158:15.86]Do I have any intel on this guy?
[158:18.04]I don't know.
[158:22.87]Maybe I can instantly kill him.
[158:27.37]I don't want to interrogate him.
[158:29.29]What?
[158:31.47]I didn't even interrogate him.
[158:32.75]I just fucking blew his head up.
[158:42.42]Interrogate that guy.
[158:43.90]Just kidding.
[158:45.10]Explode his head.
[158:46.16]Let's be careful here.
[158:51.68]Arrow proof.
[158:52.24]Now he's angry.
[159:00.52]Just, let's do it.
[159:02.08]Let's hope he just instantly murdered everybody here.
[159:07.49]And him.
[159:08.09]And him.
[159:08.37]Come on, keep going forward.
[159:09.87]No, not the guy directly in front of him.
[159:13.03]That's what I wanted.
[159:13.71]Can't attack him from the front.
[159:17.66]I gotta, like, stun him.
[159:21.66]And... I'm also stunned.
[159:30.04]One more execute will do it.
[159:33.20]Well, that was dangerous.
[159:36.58]I think I got away from that.
[159:43.05]And take off his head.
[159:48.03]Take his head.
[159:52.07]Let him kill you?
[159:52.85]No!
[159:54.47]My nemesis died.
[159:55.51]I don't need to have another one.
[160:03.99]This way.
[160:04.29]Just gonna run.
[160:13.35]I need to be myself when the axe guys show up?
[160:17.51]What?
[160:20.66]I will tell you, I do love this automatic Assassin's Creed.
[160:23.26]I was gonna throw this guy off the cliff, but no, he's money.
[160:31.16]I'm gonna take it.
[160:35.41]Almost there, we can almost do the first real siege, I think, of the game.
[160:39.91]Getting close.
[160:47.27]Money right there.
[160:51.19]Makes it easy for casuals.
[160:53.91]Who cares?
[160:57.14]I thought that guy just said a really, really bad swear word for a second.
[161:00.28]I was like, wow.
[161:01.10]I was like, oh boy.
[161:08.95]Ooh, a life gem.
[161:14.38]Fuck this, I'm just gonna come in and take all this stuff and then run away.
[161:17.32]I'm gonna be such a coward about this whole situation.
[161:23.93]Like, what a coward.
[161:24.83]You know what I'm saying?
[161:26.01]Doesn't matter though.
[161:30.67]Got what I came for.
[161:40.04]Anytime I run like this fast in this game, I really feel like I'm playing Saints Row.
[161:43.18]What?
[161:44.04]Recognize me?
[161:45.92]No?
[161:47.16]Good.
[161:48.48]I've been under your nose the whole time.
[161:51.54]God.
[161:58.64]What?
[161:59.78]I don't even get a chance.
[162:01.14]If you die, Ranger, whom will I shadow?
[162:09.64]Nothing personal.
[162:10.76]Okay.
[162:13.19]Epic.
[162:14.93]Looks like he's taking over battle reports.
[162:16.67]Yep.
[162:20.21]Do I have details on him?
[162:25.61]No.
[162:27.75]Loyal blood brother of unknown captain.
[162:31.51]Advanced class assassin.
[162:33.09]Lethal killer who prefers to ambush.
[162:36.64]Tribe bonus.
[162:38.59]Okay.
[162:38.77]Well.
[162:38.91]Timmy the Boy, ladies and gentlemen.
[162:40.35]Timmy the Boy.
[162:58.46]We need to get back.
[162:59.95]The city needs us.
[163:01.35]Middle Earth needs us.
[163:03.07]Minas Ithil is merely the first casualty in a long campaign.
[163:08.27]Whose side am I on here?
[163:10.32]I could have done a story mission so far.
[163:13.50]But I'm so caught up in hating orcs.
[163:16.74]I can't do any missions.
[163:19.64]I'm right here.
[163:20.28]I gotta do this first.
[163:22.21]Going here.
[163:23.53]Intel on this guy.
[163:25.57]Get this last thing.
[163:26.99]Go open the poem door.
[163:28.67]And then that's really gonna keep going.
[163:30.57]Let's go.
[163:31.65]I need intel, though.
[163:33.04]Is intel literally right there?
[163:34.86]But there's also a guy there.
[163:45.29]You get the speed boost if I remember.
[163:47.89]If you land, you hit A, and you run faster.
[163:50.27]This guy is alone right here.
[163:53.73]Just drop down.
[163:54.37]When you drop down, I'm hitting B. There he is.
[164:00.51]And give me a .
[164:14.36]I don't know why I like this game.
[164:15.24]It doesn't even have car crashes.
[164:18.60]So... Can be killed instantly using fire.
[164:25.62]Heavily damaged by beasts.
[164:28.19]And he's damaged by everything else.
[164:29.65]So he can die instantly if I light him on fire.
[164:32.49]Well, that's good to know.
[164:34.25]So let's blow him up.
[164:37.83]Oh, shit.
[164:45.17]Get a beast.
[164:46.21]I'm going to blow fire up next to him.
[164:49.65]This is going to be real quick, I promise.
[164:51.13]This is going to be really fast.
[164:54.79]There's going to be something right next to him that I can explode.
[164:57.81]Where is he?
[165:00.16]No, he's not there.
[165:01.24]He's down here somewhere.
[165:05.88]I want to drop down.
[165:10.49]All the tracks.
[165:13.75]Real quick.
[165:19.45]It's too addicting, I'm telling you.
[165:21.61]It's very addicting to just run around and kill things.
[165:23.75]I'm sorry.
[165:25.37]I've been doing the collect the story shit.
[165:27.31]Don't worry.
[165:28.11]Like I haven't been doing it.
[165:30.29]Where is he?
[165:31.19]He's up there.
[165:33.31]Please be standing right next to fire.
[165:37.66]He's surrounded by people, too.
[165:39.10]This is not going to be easy.
[165:44.28]There he is.
[165:45.22]Okay, Og.
[165:52.65]Please be standing right next to something to blow up.
[165:57.89]I'm going to laugh my ass off if there's a canister next to him.
[166:00.47]No.
[166:03.30]What's that over there?
[166:09.89]The egg returns.
[166:14.09]Alright, well, there's something here.
[166:18.69]Execution.
[166:20.01]What?
[166:21.28]An enemy captain is executing Gondorian prisoners.
[166:23.98]Well, he's probably right here.
[166:24.76]He might as well just get it over with.
[166:28.66]They're not even, like... Wait, what?
[166:47.35]Where's the... Looks like we'll be slaughtering more man meat today.
[166:53.24]Og and Mohg.
[166:57.72]Well, why don't you get up and fight?
[167:03.80]Fight!
[167:04.52]You all get me that one.
[167:05.68]He's dead.
[167:06.56]You cannot hurt me.
[167:07.56]No man can hurt me.
[167:18.12]Death Defying.
[167:27.83]Are you sure about that?
[167:38.91]Got it.
[167:41.17]Yeah.
[167:43.15]I'm the real fucking strong human in these parts.
[167:49.89]Just don't bump into me so I can collect this.
[167:55.11]Alright, found the guy.
[168:10.06]What?
[168:10.30]He didn't step in the fire?
[168:11.44]That's bullshit.
[168:15.29]I'm angry about that.
[168:21.23]He's all the way up there.
[168:21.95]Fine, just make it.
[168:25.05]That's right here.
[168:25.79]Just let me get it.
[168:26.55]I'm fucking getting so distracted.
[168:31.25]Just turn into Celebrimbor, read the fucking dumb Mario Sunshine painting on the wall, and get out of here.
[168:41.99]Go jet grind radio this thing, and then get me the fuck out of here.
[168:47.67]There it is.
[168:50.83]I can now open the door.
[168:51.70]There we go.
[169:00.46]Up, up, up, up, up.
[169:03.42]Just need to burn the guy.
[169:04.36]I need to burn him for one second.
[169:07.65]And I win.
[169:11.05]He just needs to light on fire.
[169:12.15]What is that?
[169:17.79]He's so far away.
[169:23.20]How far away do you have to be, man?
[169:33.23]Come on!
[169:34.93]Oh, there's something else here, too.
[169:38.23]Karagor raid.
[169:42.28]Gondorians are raiding Muzu the Sweet's Karagor pens.
[169:45.04]Good, because I want one.
[169:48.50]Dominate one and I can go to the, um...
[169:56.11]Don't do it.
[169:57.01]What do you mean?
[170:00.55]Why not?
[170:01.19]I have ADHD bad.
[170:05.03]I know.
[170:05.39]I really do.
[170:06.99]Open the Karagor cages.
[170:08.07]Come on out.
[170:12.64]There's one more over here.
[170:17.50]That's not a Karagor.
[170:21.12]That's not a Karagor cage.
[170:29.05]What the fuck?
[170:29.53]Get out of my way!
[170:34.53]That's not a Karagor, though.
[170:36.05]That's a... That's a Rancor.
[170:42.40]Grogs are formidable beasts that require considerable effort to bring down, and when a Grog roars, shoot it in the head with a charged shot.
[170:52.12]Oh, I gotta open up some more crates.
[170:55.18]I gotta open up some more Karagor crates.
[170:58.59]Where is the other Karagor crate?
[171:13.20]Did I win?
[171:15.06]Was I supposed to be helping Muzu the Sweet?
[171:17.12]Because I got a reward and I got a skill point.
[171:20.18]Was I a double agent there?
[171:22.85]Maybe.
[171:29.04]Legendary Karagor trades.
[171:33.08]I need that Karagor.
[171:34.02]I can't die.
[171:40.29]I need to get on top of this guy.
[171:42.23]No, no, no, no.
[171:43.19]Get out of here.
[171:43.95]No, no.
[171:45.01]You, no.
[171:46.03]I need that.
[171:47.07]You fucking asshole.
[171:48.05]Well, I'm going to take him.
[171:49.47]What?
[171:49.99]What?
[171:53.39]This is not a good time for you to be here, man.
[171:59.48]Oh my god!
[172:06.48]No, fight the orcs.
[172:07.72]The orcs are the bad guys.
[172:09.14]Not me.
[172:10.50]You're fighting the wrong person.
[172:14.14]Oh, you fucking dumb dickhead.
[172:16.54]Stop attacking me.
[172:17.74]There's so many people around that you need to attack.
[172:20.67]Just do all my work for me.
[172:22.21]I'm hiding.
[172:23.51]Fuck this.
[172:24.33]I'm gonna get a front row seat at this show.
[172:30.37]I just want to watch the show.
[172:31.55]Get me up there.
[172:34.15]Okay.
[172:34.83]Now just do all my work for me.
[172:37.75]I'm just gonna pick him off with a bow and arrow.
[172:40.02]Oh my god.
[172:41.10]Fucking jump scare.
[172:45.16]Get out of here!
[172:59.84]Alright, he's dead.
[173:08.18]I'll get him.
[173:08.72]One on one up here.
[173:09.42]This is exactly what I wanted.
[173:10.56]Just like that fucking boss in Bloodborne that has the gatling gun.
[173:12.92]Just don't fall off.
[173:19.22]Somebody's shooting at me from far away.
[173:20.90]Who is it?
[173:21.22]It's that asshole over there.
[173:30.85]What am I doing?
[173:32.37]No, what am I doing?
[173:35.49]No, second chance.
[173:42.32]Shut up.
[173:45.26]Where's the giant guy?
[173:54.06]I gotta cut this guy's head off.
[173:56.09]This is what has to happen here.
[174:00.90]I gotta... Jesus.
[174:02.54]Now he's enraged.
[174:05.64]Okay, be careful here.
[174:08.62]Here it is.
[174:15.65]Get it.
[174:18.83]Die.
[174:19.45]Head.
[174:20.03]Take his head.
[174:20.51]It's a pity you won't be around to see it.
[174:24.29]Gondor running red with the blood of man.
[174:27.89]Starting with that doomed city of yours.
[174:30.29]He's going to get up, isn't he?
[174:32.07]Oh, my God.
[174:32.99]Cut his head off.
[174:35.35]That guy took his arm off.
[174:37.65]Oh, my God.
[174:41.42]Okay, the only way you're coming back is if you crawl to find me.
[174:49.40]I'm okay with that.
[174:52.22]Well, sayonara.
[174:57.46]Is that guy still running amuck with havoc down here?
[175:00.91]There he is.
[175:01.31]I really wanted a Karagor.
[175:06.17]Find your target?
[175:08.81]Where is he?
[175:13.49]I forgot.
[175:14.83]I forgot the mission that I was on.
[175:18.04]I lost all control.
[175:21.07]I was sitting there questioning what the hell was going on.
[175:23.39]I was like, why?
[175:23.95]What's taking so long?
[175:30.41]I need to break the Karagor and then run over there.
[175:33.78]Run.
[175:37.94]Get on the Karagor.
[175:43.24]Get on him.
[175:46.31]Alright, let's go.
[175:47.29]This contest will be won by will and will alone.
[175:54.87]Strength, skill, speed.
[175:56.73]These things matter not.
[175:59.27]And if you believe they do, I've already won.
[176:04.57]Is this guy going to instantly kill my Karagor?
[176:11.36]I hope not.
[176:11.92]Darkness comes for you.
[176:17.93]No.
[176:18.21]Okay.
[176:19.01]Some guys can instantly do that.
[176:22.01]Sorry, but I'm gonna die.
[176:27.87]I'm gonna get it.
[176:28.77]Oh, god.
[176:29.11]He's... What?
[176:29.65]How?
[176:30.45]Oh, my god.
[176:31.29]Fuck you.
[176:32.64]God damn it.
[176:33.82]What the fuck?
[176:37.02]That's so annoying.
[176:38.08]That's annoying.
[176:39.26]The guy, like, turned my Karagor into flies.
[176:42.26]That's fantastic.
[176:48.16]This guy is a real pain in the ass, it seems.
[176:50.90]You can't do anything to him.
[176:54.87]Can I hurt him with executions?
[176:58.09]I hope so.
[176:58.55]Barely hurts him.
[177:00.23]Let's light him on fire.
[177:16.49]Come here.
[177:20.81]Come on.
[177:22.30]Stumble over here.
[177:23.44]Yep.
[177:26.94]Now you're on fire, dickhead.
[177:35.50]Retreat.
[177:36.34]Retreat.
[177:36.94]I don't think that's going to happen.
[177:47.90]Do the story.
[177:57.56]I'm trying to do the story.
[177:59.81]I'm trying.
[178:02.03]Rare and epic weapons are armor of high quality pieces.
[178:04.31]There's too many distractions in this game.
[178:10.97]I got a cool thing now.
[178:14.33]What is this?
[178:17.56]What is this?
[178:19.94]Battle hammer?
[178:21.54]I throw hammers?
[178:24.28]So wait, it does less damage, but... 20% chance that a headshot curses enemies.
[178:30.55]Charge throws, it does like an explosion.
[178:35.59]Okay.
[178:36.19]Well, let's go.
[178:39.77]Why is he holding the hammer like a bow?
[178:44.36]I don't know, that's weird.
[178:45.12]What is this?
[178:47.06]Perfect counter.
[178:47.48]Well-timed counters knock down enemies.
[178:48.96]Press when the prompt flashes blue.
[178:52.51]Brutalize.
[178:52.93]I remember brutalizations were crazy in the old game.
[178:57.85]You just absolutely decimate people.
[179:01.73]The animations are pretty fantastic.
[179:03.45]This is also freeze pin.
[179:06.60]I remember that.
[179:09.04]Elven light.
[179:12.24]It makes a big explosion, like a shockwave around you.
[179:20.65]Where is he?
[179:22.23]I know he's around here somewhere.
[179:23.59]He's still around, I think.
[179:27.05]Where is that fucking monster?
[179:31.57]Did he die?
[179:37.93]Where's that monster?
[179:38.79]He's Godzilla-ing.
[179:41.37]He's like King Kong-ing somewhere on this map.
[179:49.79]Oh.
[179:50.59]Well, who cares.
[179:53.45]Alright, I... Distracted again!
[179:57.85]Get the fuck outta here!
[180:03.69]Where is he?
[180:05.47]He's gone.
[180:06.21]Don't matter.
[180:06.77]Forget it.
[180:07.19]We're gonna move.
[180:07.87]We're gonna move.
[180:08.49]We're gonna go.
[180:10.11]Am I still on the tutorial?
[180:11.67]I've been playing, like, kill orcs and level up the game.
[180:16.34]I'm going this way.
[180:17.22]Og, we're going to have to kill Og another time.
[180:20.33]I promised I was going to do this.
[180:27.63]Let's go open up the door, the magic door.
[180:32.31]That was kind of strange, but it's okay.
[180:34.03]Magic door.
[180:41.74]Og, kill Og.
[180:42.66]No, I'm still like...
[180:45.00]It's timed.
[180:45.42]That's fine.
[180:46.32]I will never... I will have to stay here forever.
[180:51.06]There we go.
[180:52.40]Thank you.
[180:54.17]I can now open the door.
[180:57.05]Whatever that means.
[180:58.85]Use the recovered Ithildin to restore the poem.
[181:01.65]Reading the inscription will open the door and reveal its hidden relics.
[181:07.07]Wait a minute.
[181:07.51]This is not...
[181:13.66]Oh, this is not, uh, this is just a side mission.
[181:19.08]In the land of Mordor, where the land lie, oh, it's land lie, we bear our banners aloft, boots like wrath, our shadows quick, our countenance dire, for who in this dark dream haunted
[181:38.60]Doom dares resist the righteous flames of Cadence.
[181:43.50]And Doom and drums themselves to despair.
[181:46.39]Ah, where the shadows lie, we bear our banners aloft, boots like... Shadows...
[182:04.16]The land of Mordor where the shadows lie.
[182:05.88]We bear our banners aloft.
[182:07.04]Boots like shadows.
[182:08.04]Our shadows are quick.
[182:11.66]Our boots.
[182:13.18]Our drums are quick.
[182:16.08]Our boots.
[182:19.04]Boots like land.
[182:21.54]I'm like freaking myself out.
[182:22.74]Hold on.
[182:23.14]In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie.
[182:28.46]We bear our banners aloft.
[182:30.10]Boots like wrath are a
[182:40.39]Boots like drums.
[182:47.84]You guys are making me fucking laugh too much.
[182:49.68]And laugh themselves.
[183:02.64]Oh my god.
[183:14.44]It's not a joke.
[183:15.40]It's not a joke.
[183:16.82]I'm, like, too busy laughing at, like, the things.
[183:19.16]This is what happens, man.
[183:23.94]Like, I fucking look over a chat and I start fucking laughing.
[183:26.61]And then I come back over here and I laugh at this.
[183:28.31]And then, like, I try to fix it.
[183:29.37]And then I end up laughing again.
[183:30.31]That's, like, that's, like, refreshing.
[183:36.73]Did I fail English?
[183:37.55]No.
[183:37.81]I'm just fucking, it's just too much for me.
[183:39.72]I'm laughing about it a little.
[183:40.86]You know what I mean?
[183:41.80]It's hard when you fucking laugh.
[183:50.00]Our drums quick.
[184:01.33]Our drums quick.
[184:04.17]In the land of Mordor where we bear our banners aloft, boots like shadows, our drums quick
[184:13.48]our continents dire.
[184:15.52]For who in this dark, dream-haunted land dares resist the righteous flame of... It's like shadows.
[184:42.12]2000 I can't I'm like having so much trouble because my like OCD and ADHD have like taken over completely Boots like drums.
[184:55.68]This has got to be shadows Is this part of the wrath is quick I
[185:11.70]Now, please stop doing that.
[185:20.14]I don't know what cadence means, alright?
[185:21.98]I don't know what it means.
[185:23.11]What is cadence?
[185:24.97]Are cadence... What does cadence mean?
[185:27.11]I don't understand.
[185:27.59]I'm going to come real with you guys.
[185:28.87]What does the word cadence mean?
[185:33.83]What is cadence?
[185:35.37]What does it mean?
[185:40.63]I've never heard that word before.
[185:42.77]In my sixth grade education.
[185:48.97]It's tempo.
[185:49.51]Why does it say fucking tempo?
[186:15.21]See, now I know what the word means, now I can do the poem.
[186:22.30]I didn't know what the word cadence meant.
[186:25.30]In the land of Mordor, where the shadows lie, we bear our banners aloft.
[186:30.46]Boots like drums, our cadence quick, our countenance dire.
[186:35.67]For whom in this dark, dream-haunted land bears resist the righteous flame of wrath?
[186:42.29]Undo themselves.
[186:44.59]I mean, alright, so for instance, like, a quarter of that was a joke, but I really didn't know what the word cadence meant.
[186:53.55]At the beginning, the first two minutes of that was a joke.
[186:56.21]The rest of it wasn't.
[186:56.93]And that wasn't even a story mission.
[186:58.93]It was just a piece of armor.
[187:02.91]That was like half a joke and then it became like a reality.
[187:10.66]Oh shit, that's fucking cool.
[187:11.60]Let's see what it does.
[187:15.52]You gain one wrath when getting hit.
[187:17.00]That's cool.
[187:18.82]Two hours for a piece of fucking legendary.
[187:20.54]It's a legendary armor though.
[187:24.93]At least it was a legendary.
[187:28.97]Alright, now let's go do the... Let's go do the mission now.
[187:31.97]Does that sound like fun?
[187:54.30]Something about this is making me really fucking laugh.
[187:57.48]Kill Og.
[187:58.20]No, no.
[187:58.82]We're doing the first mission of the game.
[188:02.53]I'm a completionist.
[188:03.53]I wanted to see what was in there.
[188:05.95]You're talking about a completionist.
[188:09.01]Mad libs aside, I wanted to know... Wait, what is this?
[188:11.95]Dead guy?
[188:17.52]What do I need intel on?
[188:19.68]You, sure.
[188:21.60]Pug, the ugliest dog.
[188:28.53]Let's go.
[188:32.97]And kill Og if you're a Completionist.
[188:34.80]No, I'm only a Completionist on collecting missions, when you collect things.
[188:40.30]Kill Og?
[188:40.54]No, I'm not gonna kill Og!
[188:42.10]He's a piece of shit, who cares?
[188:43.62]We don't need to kill Og.
[188:44.89]He's worthless.
[188:58.26]Alright, you guys ready for the first mission of the game?
[189:01.11]After I get distracted... Wait, why can I only hit the guy?
[189:22.16]I'm trying to knock him over the fucking cliff.
[189:26.37]It's not going to work.
[189:29.36]Who cares?
[189:29.76]Let's blow his head up.
[189:32.72]The Seeing Stone.
[189:33.70]First mission of the game.
[189:37.44]Under siege, find the palantir before the city falls.
[189:39.24]You got it.
[189:46.97]Tackle him.
[189:52.55]Look, I got distracted.
[189:54.15]I wanted to collect all the songs.
[189:55.45]Ben Elnor gave another 80 bucks.
[189:56.81]Thank you, Ben.
[189:57.19]40, 20, and 20.
[189:57.43]Is the game worth a buy?
[189:58.93]It depends on how much you like the first one.
[190:22.09]as you can see like I got distracted for like two and a half hours and didn't even do like the first mission of the game I got distracted just running around looking at stuff and killing people and collecting items so obviously there's a lot of content I would say if you liked the first one then yeah what's my opinion on Palma San Juan it's delicious boots like milk
[190:46.90]Thank you, Ben, for the Boots Like Milk $80.
[190:50.80]Question and answer, period.
[190:55.87]Add it to the list of almost $100 again.
[191:01.13]Nearly, like, again, like $300 or $400 tonight, again.
[191:07.43]Very, very generous of you.
[191:08.92]Thank you.
[191:10.54]Thank you.
[191:15.96]Alright, so let's do the first mission.
[191:18.08]To the gates!
[191:18.80]But get out of my way!
[191:22.49]Everyone's just getting in my way.
[191:24.03]Just watch out, man.
[191:25.01]Here we go.
[191:43.16]And I'll cover yours!
[191:44.82]And my axe!
[191:46.70]And my bow!
[191:49.34]And my default guy.
[191:50.78]I'm Aragorn, I'm a default guy.
[191:53.33]I don't have anything interesting.
[191:57.31]I'm not a little guy with an axe that has funny, like, words come out of my mouth.
[192:05.42]I'm not an elf with a cool bow that can slide down elephant trunks.
[192:09.44]Just a guy.
[192:11.72]And my milk!
[192:15.70]That was only the beginning.
[192:16.98]There'll be more.
[192:18.42]We have to find out what we're dealing with.
[192:20.80]This way.
[192:21.87]Free stuff.
[192:27.85]We'll be able to see the entire lower city once we get there.
[192:40.96]What?
[192:47.18]Get out of the way.
[192:50.72]Oh, that would've been so dumb.
[192:55.49]Wait, what?
[192:56.03]What am I doing?
[193:14.49]why would I do that why there was no reason to do that there was I just like turned and had to I don't know why I get distracted that's why I can't play these games we'll be able to see the entire lower city once we get there
[193:45.28]No matter how much time you spend with these people, you are no longer one of them.
[193:50.68]That life is lost.
[193:53.66]Okay, that one was not my fault.
[193:56.24]I will say that one's not my fault.
[194:02.71]I'm trying to just rush through it.
[194:04.57]I know where to stand.
[194:05.41]I know what to do.
[194:06.69]I'm just trying to collect things fast.
[194:09.19]It's going to be right there.
[194:10.03]I'm over to the left.
[194:10.73]Look, I get it.
[194:11.55]I know.
[194:11.81]Right there.
[194:12.09]Look, see?
[194:15.07]I just wanted to collect the thing and do it as fast as possible, but it ended up killing me.
[194:17.93]I got hit three times in a row.
[194:20.57]It's not the game's fault.
[194:21.47]It's my fault for trying to go as fast.
[194:22.91]And she's going to get hit by that.
[194:25.94]No, I didn't get hit by that.
[194:27.08]I was outside the circle.
[194:28.00]See?
[194:31.04]See?
[194:31.32]He's getting hit by it.
[194:34.43]We're like fucking hit detection in this game.
[194:41.02]I can control them.
[194:41.94]Disable the siege.
[194:42.98]Hit the boxes.
[194:43.64]There it is.
[194:44.66]Out of the way, please.
[194:45.70]Yep, do the frog jump.
[195:14.27]Oh, boy.
[195:17.53]Oh, God.
[195:18.53]Okay.
[195:20.45]What am I doing?
[195:22.59]Destroy the forces.
[195:25.18]Oh, I get to use one of them.
[195:26.32]See?
[195:26.54]Look, it's not that easy to dodge.
[195:28.36]Look at all these players right now.
[195:30.36]There's the red circle.
[195:31.22]They're not avoiding it.
[195:32.12]Holy shit.
[195:36.50]Oh, God.
[195:36.86]I gotta shoot it, right?
[195:38.45]Shoot him.
[195:46.06]One more.
[195:46.70]That should do it, right?
[195:48.14]See you later.
[195:50.53]Oh my god, they are swarming the city right now.
[195:54.07]There's too many people here.
[195:55.37]There's so many coins in the ground, too.
[196:00.96]Okay.
[196:04.78]Jesus.
[196:05.08]That was just tower defense.
[196:16.69]Why can I not take him with me?
[196:20.05]Hold on.
[196:21.37]For a second, I thought I was just going to saw this guy.
[196:22.93]I thought I was going to just do the reverse jaw snap.
[196:27.70]Shadow Strider.
[196:28.36]Press A while leaping to double jump.
[196:31.00]That's cool.
[196:33.87]There's so much coins.
[196:34.84]Look at all these coins on the ground.
[196:39.72]Nice.
[196:40.68]Okay.
[196:41.36]Sorry.
[196:41.64]It's going to take me like a minute.
[196:45.26]No.
[196:45.54]It's only five coins.
[196:52.70]Don't make me do this the whole time.
[196:54.77]I'm sorry.
[196:59.15]No.
[196:59.57]It's not worth it.
[197:00.11]This is not enough to warrant what I'm doing.
[197:05.34]shit there's a timer get up there go go go come on as you distracted fucking idiot go fucking cartwheel get over there come on no no it was tight
[197:28.85]Oh, god damn it.
[197:29.15]It's okay.
[197:30.37]Don't worry.
[197:31.05]It has a moron barrier.
[197:32.29]There's a moron barrier here, guys.
[197:33.91]It's okay.
[197:34.41]Luigi can take over.
[197:57.19]Get over there.
[197:58.35]Dominate him.
[197:59.10]No, don't...
[198:06.68]Yeah, don't worry.
[198:07.52]I'm fine.
[198:08.28]We need to get more tower defense.
[198:14.70]Right in the center here.
[198:16.73]We can get it all.
[198:17.97]Blink.
[198:18.87]Oh boy.
[198:19.53]Watch out.
[198:22.03]It's two shots to get rid of this guy.
[198:23.57]Just two more siege beasts.
[198:26.43]Let's take those out right now.
[198:29.71]And then I need to kill like 80.
[198:30.83]That's two.
[198:34.17]Bring it down, come on!
[198:35.72]Watch it.
[198:41.90]And this should do it.
[198:43.08]There it is.
[198:43.82]Kill the beast.
[198:47.90]It's a very pretty game, I will say, for sure.
[198:54.24]Hey, we did it.
[198:56.58]I just took a sip of my coffee.
[199:01.72]And it's been so long since I've taken another sip of this coffee that it's... It was only water, like coffee, water, ice shit.
[199:08.35]And it almost made me want to throw up.
[199:14.12]That was a World of Warcraft quest.
[199:20.03]That was a World of Warcraft quest after they said that they were going to make more cool, interesting quests in Burning Crusade, and you fly around on a bat and drop bombs.
[199:28.90]That's a nice part.
[199:29.64]You have a valuable weapon.
[199:46.86]Yeah, they promised, like, more interesting quests.
[199:49.51]So they made bombing-run missions, like, 19 times.
[199:52.45]It was cool.
[199:53.63]I remember playing it and thinking it was really awesome.
[200:01.63]The Death Knight starter quest, yeah.
[200:04.01]And then they kept doing it to death.
[200:05.31]And then the expansions later... They're still doing bombing-run missions in Legion.
[200:12.30]There's probably 180 bombing-run quests.
[200:22.60]Then I will find my father.
[200:24.34]Distracted?
[200:24.86]I know.
[200:25.14]I can't help it.
[200:30.56]I'm having a lot of fun in this game, though.
[200:32.35]I'm enjoying the game.
[200:42.13]Middle Earth stealth smoochies?
[200:47.29]What's the title of this stream right now?
[200:48.99]Put a lot of trust in her.
[200:50.77]Give her time.
[200:52.58]Until then, we should return to Shelob.
[200:55.38]Oh, God.
[200:55.88]Hold on.
[200:57.48]Alright, here we go.
[201:00.52]We unlocked Los Santos.
[201:07.95]Ben Elnor with another $50.
[201:09.81]And he just... Is that a milk emote?
[201:19.17]I think that's a milk emote with quotes around it.
[201:25.77]Knife in the Dark available in Sirith Ungol.
[201:30.06]Why do all these places sound like Gwar band members?
[201:34.78]Come on down to Odorous Orungus.
[201:37.60]Sirith Ungol.
[201:40.22]Minas Barfman.
[201:42.40]These are all Gwar members.
[201:43.48]Alright, anyways, so... Milk, milk, milk.
[201:48.30]Thank you, Ben.
[201:49.04]Thank you, Ben, for the milk.
[201:50.32]Thank you, Ben, for the milk money.
[201:55.10]Thank you so much, dude.
[201:57.30]Gorok13, thank you for the bits.
[201:59.34]Smorkog is looking up what to bake for Orc dinner.
[202:03.14]Chef Frank.
[202:05.06]Orc.
[202:05.86]Whatever that means.
[202:06.58]Thank you for the bits.
[202:08.18]Thank you, Jen, for the bits.
[202:08.96]Darkstar, thanks for the bits as well.
[202:10.26]It highlights the answers on top of the screen.
[202:13.92]Don't even tell me that's true.
[202:15.30]Was it actually highlighting the answers?
[202:16.86]Or was I too distracted to even see that?
[202:19.08]What a fucking miserable idiot.
[202:22.10]Am I that tunnel vision stupid that I couldn't see that?
[202:25.12]That's unbelievable.
[202:27.92]Thank you though.
[202:31.18]Alright, so a knife in the dark, she lob.
[202:34.97]Let's just put it on.
[202:37.09]I can fast travel to this?
[202:39.57]Sure, why not?
[202:41.15]Yes, that's unbelievable.
[202:44.41]That's unbelievable.
[202:45.17]Like I'm just too excited.
[202:46.38]I'm so excited.
[202:47.22]This is gonna be a long stream by the way.
[202:48.98]I'm too excited for this game.
[202:50.95]We got to the first mission in three hours.
[202:56.32]Behind enemy lines, a knife in the dark.
[202:57.46]The armies of Sirith Ungol are gathering for the final assault on Minas Ithil.
[203:04.04]Shelob has information that can help you target and eliminate the leaders of the orc army.
[203:07.44]Return to her and dismantle Sauron's army from within.
[203:11.02]Disable outpost to reduce enemy strength in the region.
[203:13.30]To disable an outpost, defeat the captain who leads it.
[203:19.34]Oh, this is beautiful.
[203:24.14]Wow.
[203:26.47]This is pretty sick, like Hogwarts.
[203:29.69]I like it.
[203:34.31]Just taking a look.
[203:34.91]Remember, I waited six years for this game.
[203:42.12]I can ride that thing.
[203:42.74]I can break that thing down and I can ride it.
[203:51.16]I'm going to wait until it's ready.
[203:54.74]I'm gonna get on top of him.
[204:01.90]This is too high.
[204:02.70]Okay, well, I'll do this.
[204:09.58]Can't read a basic sentence.
[204:17.35]I just get too distracted, but let's do the... find the stuff with the magnifying glass of minigame.
[204:27.83]That's so stupid that I did that whole thing for... Well, at least I have the armor.
[204:31.75]I don't have to do that in the first area.
[204:34.45]I got that out of the way, and now I have a really good piece of chest.
[204:40.03]I'm aware that that was really odd English, I know.
[204:42.11]And I wasn't going to address it, but I guess I am.
[204:51.06]One more.
[204:54.66]Okay, there we go.
[204:58.30]Really good pizza chest.
[205:00.80]Now where is the giant guy?
[205:03.32]There he is.
[205:09.71]That's the Empire State Building Spider-Man jump.
[205:15.11]No, not you.
[205:15.65]The guy.
[205:15.93]The big guy.
[205:16.95]Big one.
[205:18.73]This is why I did it.
[205:22.69]X is to attack when your might is full.
[205:24.29]Press Y and B to eat enemies for health.
[205:29.26]Give me the gem.
[205:35.76]I could... These guys couldn't climb before.
[205:38.04]You just play hopscotch on them.
[205:43.12]That's how you win.
[205:47.01]I don't want to lose this guy for the rest of the game.
[205:49.21]Okay, I'm doing good on health.
[205:55.55]Let's collect this stuff.
[205:59.14]Get back on him, please What the fuck is going on?
[206:03.20]Why did that happen?
[206:04.32]What happened?
[206:05.96]Why did he turn?
[206:09.26]What did it become midnight?
[206:12.52]My giant cool thing turned into a fucking mouse.
[206:14.68]I don't understand like what was a Cinderella What?
[206:20.24]Come on get over here.
[206:21.56]Hey Alright, he's back Okay
[206:29.96]We're good.
[206:37.44]I think I gotta run away.
[206:38.50]I don't want this guy to be dead.
[206:42.36]Eat the forest.
[206:44.98]Now let's make a run for it.
[206:45.90]Let's get to where we need to go.
[206:51.97]Oh, this is awesome.
[206:53.61]Can I please play as Donkey Kong for the rest of the whole game?
[206:57.43]I'm so glad you can run and jump like this.
[207:02.53]Stop out there!
[207:03.19]I don't like that fire!
[207:04.09]Get it out of here!
[207:04.95]Eat him.
[207:17.65]I'm just a big baby, I love it.
[207:20.21]Yeah!
[207:21.73]Let's go!
[207:25.47]What happened?
[207:26.03]Okay, that was odd.
[207:28.95]Can I please tell him I can climb on huge buildings?
[207:36.53]I don't think I'm supposed to be doing this with this guy.
[207:38.23]Not in this area.
[207:42.63]No, no, don't poison me.
[207:43.45]I don't want this guy poisoned.
[207:46.11]I've wanted him around for a long time.
[207:47.68]Don't eat the poison either.
[207:51.28]Alright, so, let's go to the mission.
[207:56.24]There's another one.
[208:02.33]What?
[208:04.55]New enemy's ghouls.
[208:06.07]Ghouls are weak on the run, but deadly in horde.
[208:07.49]Some ghouls spray their enemies with poison.
[208:10.19]Yeah, if ghouls successfully retreat to the mound, they will return with a deadly ghoul matron.
[208:19.27]I hope he's gonna be here.
[208:20.15]There's too much happening.
[208:36.49]Alright, start Knife in the Dark.
[208:41.51]The Palantir is out of reach for now, but perhaps she loves Visions can guide you.
[208:46.13]Grog V. Grog?
[208:49.02]Okay.
[208:50.52]That works for me.
[208:51.96]Let's see what happens here.
[208:54.56]Now this is why I bought the game.
[209:10.30]Og V Grog V Og.
[209:13.70]Og V Grog.
[209:18.66]I mean, I'm not even- I can't even follow what's happening on the screen.
[209:21.06]There's too many things going on.
[209:24.67]There's birds, there's bugs.
[209:26.07]Did you just get a rock thrown at me?
[209:29.53]Yeah, he threw a rock.
[209:38.08]Alright, get over here.
[209:38.64]Grog!
[209:39.66]What are you... No, don't have me fuck this whole thing up.
[209:44.51]I gotta run the fuck away.
[209:45.33]Come on, Grog.
[209:46.71]Fight.
[209:49.79]What the fuck, man?
[209:51.61]Why?
[209:51.97]Does he have pinpoint accuracy?
[209:54.21]He shouldn't have pinpoint accuracy.
[209:55.99]He's just climbing up here.
[209:57.59]Help me!
[209:58.57]Help!
[209:59.63]Help!
[210:02.78]No!
[210:03.30]Jesus!
[210:05.92]Fight him!
[210:07.44]Fight that guy!
[210:10.12]Fight him!
[210:12.39]Why are they standing there?
[210:13.97]They both just look angry.
[210:16.85]Do something!
[210:17.65]Rock'em Sock'em Robot!
[210:21.65]There we go.
[210:28.45]He was laughing at the fight and then he decided to fight.
[210:33.74]Defenders block frontal attacks and must be hit from behind.
[210:41.78]And my guy's gonna die.
[210:45.34]Come here!
[210:47.42]Mount!
[210:48.10]Mount!
[210:49.16]Mount!
[210:51.49]Eat somebody!
[210:53.57]Eat him!
[210:54.77]Eat his face!
[211:05.23]I have to eat somebody.
[211:06.27]No!
[211:12.49]It's alright.
[211:12.81]There's another one.
[211:18.25]There is another one in here.
[211:22.41]No don't I want to open up the cage with the guy in it And then we're gonna go into elven rage and this guy's gonna fucking wish he was never born Just like fucking racquetball my racquetball practice He's dead no that was that was a crony Alright, he's gonna die he's gonna get punched right in the back he doesn't even see it coming come on just like a joke Just like that comedy that I've been looking for the whole stream
[211:55.59]Did you see my face?
[211:58.01]Oh, fuck.
[212:01.16]Who is this?
[212:01.86]There's this bird person.
[212:07.76]Alright, we're good.
[212:15.13]Oh, those are the Matrons.
[212:17.99]This is fucking Matronese.
[212:23.94]I need to call this guy collect.
[212:28.12]Oh my god.
[212:29.16]Who's even hurting me?
[212:30.80]Is it the big guy?
[212:32.26]Is it the little guy?
[212:34.97]Nobody was focusing on me, so I was able to stay alive, because that was a guaranteed kill.
[212:38.97]I need elf shot.
[212:41.69]Is that a champion?
[212:45.63]No.
[212:46.47]Elf shot.
[212:50.16]Guys, I need to stop getting so distracted.
[212:52.16]It's happening again.
[212:55.10]It's happening again.
[212:57.66]I gotta stop this shit.
[213:01.19]I can summon people now.
[213:09.39]We're going beast mastery.
[213:18.65]That's all he has to say.
[213:19.45]It was so tasty.
[213:23.69]Come here.
[213:25.69]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[213:27.01]I want to get the guy, the big guy, this guy.
[213:29.59]No, not you.
[213:30.55]I want that guy.
[213:31.99]That one.
[213:32.67]That's the one I'm looking for.
[213:35.21]Now let's eat someone.
[213:45.24]I can't get out of here.
[213:46.00]I'm stuck in the cage.
[213:48.60]There's nowhere to go.
[213:52.23]Come on.
[213:53.47]Really?
[213:54.59]I can't move here.
[213:55.51]At least it's retreating.
[214:02.19]Alright, just kill him.
[214:07.13]Who cares?
[214:07.55]There's nothing I can do about this.
[214:10.07]Maybe he can get out on his own.
[214:12.95]Can he come out on his own?
[214:14.47]Come on, you can step out.
[214:21.85]Yeah, there we go.
[214:22.31]He's out.
[214:24.57]My head was blocking that.
[214:25.73]Alright, let's just go start the mission.
[214:36.91]That was funny.
[214:38.03]That was funny looking.
[214:38.91]Give me the gem.
[214:44.03]And start the mission.
[214:44.95]Hopefully I can still use it.
[214:53.81]No!
[214:54.50]Why?
[214:57.08]Why does it have to be the same button?
[214:59.04]And look, pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
[215:02.10]This was the guy inside that was controlling the giant robot.
[215:05.98]Remember Men in Black?
[215:09.84]What a shit show.
[215:11.30]Get the fuck out of my way.
[215:15.11]Start the mission.
[215:16.19]Enough.
[215:22.41]Hey, evil face, thanks for the two bucks.
[215:24.79]What would your ideal hat out of one of these be?
[215:27.57]Comic relief?
[215:28.05]Oh, it's gone.
[215:28.47]Oh.
[215:28.63]New enemy.
[215:46.00]Olog High.
[215:46.76]War Trolls.
[215:47.36]Olog High are tough combatants with powerful attacks.
[215:50.66]They will defeat attempts to vault them, but you can avoid their attacks by dodging or sliding through their legs.
[215:56.43]They can be stunned with a charge shot to the head or by landing a properly timed counter.
[215:59.87]Follow up with a stun.
[216:01.73]Follow up a stun with a series of melee strikes or hold RB to mount the Olog.
[216:06.61]Tap X repeatedly to rapidly stab him in the back and ram him into people.
[216:16.41]Well, let's do it No, yeah, please collect the coins that are around.
[216:22.21]Yep.
[216:22.45]Good job.
[216:22.81]You collected some coins and then I just got bullied Legs Wow
[216:46.22]Did I get the five cents over there, please?
[216:49.94]Okay, that was kind of cool.
[216:56.41]Let's do it again.
[217:20.77]How many times do I have to do this to him?
[217:31.86]Oh, that's in his head.
[217:32.72]Right in the back of the skull.
[217:38.86]That's how you take him out.
[217:42.96]That was cool.
[217:44.34]We saved you, Bright Master.
[217:51.60]The guy that does the voice for Gollum will never have to do anything else for the rest of his life.
[217:58.03]He just has to do the Gollum voice like once every couple years in different media.
[218:02.43]And he'll make like a couple million dollars.
[218:03.87]No!
[218:04.97]No!
[218:06.21]The Dark Mistress watches over Gollum!
[218:11.08]Gollum watches over Bright Master!
[218:16.68]Isn't the same guy, um... Isn't the same guy in the Star Wars movies, too, as, like, the bad guy?
[218:21.20]I think he is.
[218:21.92]He's pretty much the Lord of the Rings mascot, yeah.
[218:25.70]Oh, Quixie.
[218:42.78]The Lord of the Rings mascot was Bilbo Baggins?
[218:53.49]No, dude, every story is the same story.
[218:56.11]Don't you guys know this?
[218:59.03]Think about every epic, every trilogy.
[219:02.01]Every story is the same story.
[219:04.34]Star Wars, it's a story of Anakin Skywalker.
[219:06.25]It's like Anakin was Anakin and he rose and fell.
[219:09.75]Oh, don't kill the younglings.
[219:11.73]He went into despair.
[219:13.45]He was an evil, bad person.
[219:14.89]And he became like a shell of a human being.
[219:17.13]And at the very end of the story, the Emperor, wow, he saves the day.
[219:21.25]Lord of the Rings.
[219:22.55]You got Smeagol.
[219:23.17]Smeagol's like a, wow, Smeagol, the fun little hobbit.
[219:26.47]He goes to the dark side.
[219:27.85]He does a lot of really awful, mean, awful things.
[219:30.87]It's the story of Schmiegel.
[219:32.15]That's the entire story of Lord of the Rings.
[219:33.63]And, like, he comes back, throws the fucking ring into Mount Doom, and, oh, he wins the story.
[219:38.24]Every story is the same exact story.
[219:39.56]It's just who the character is.
[219:43.84]Anakin and Schmiegel are the same character.
[219:47.30]Just, they're written differently.
[219:48.70]George Lucas wrote one, and George Tolkien wrote the other one.
[219:52.60]...stolen...
[219:57.52]You begged me to have it.
[220:02.79]And what of you, darling?
[220:04.03]Oh, yeah?
[220:04.57]And what about the other George?
[220:06.03]What about George R.R.
[220:07.13]Martin?
[220:08.01]Same fucking story.
[220:09.77]Different guy.
[220:11.77]Somebody does something evil and horrible, that person sees redemption, and they're the one that makes everything good again.
[220:17.83]It's just the one character that's part of the story.
[220:20.65]Like, for instance... No, actually, I can't talk Game of Thrones because it's a current thing.
[220:24.81]You can't talk spoilers.
[220:26.31]Same show.
[220:27.77]Just another... Same show, different George.
[220:30.43]There you go.
[220:30.75]Dominic?
[220:35.57]Oh, you don't have to tell me.
[220:39.53]Here is your truth.
[220:40.43]That really hurts.
[220:48.92]There's a forced joke, and it's bad.
[220:53.66]I'm saying I'm sorry.
[220:54.32]This isn't a forced joke.
[220:55.26]It's every single story.
[221:03.46]Like, look at me.
[221:04.95]That's my story.
[221:06.31]Made like Minecraft videos like six years ago.
[221:08.43]That's like the bottom of the deceitful Satan barrel.
[221:11.83]I had my redemption, started playing some other games and started to try other videos, and I went from being an awful human being to a good person.
[221:19.73]It's a forced joke.
[221:37.72]A good person.
[221:39.54]I am a good person.
[221:44.08]Guys, I'm a good person.
[221:44.76]I don't shop at Walmart.
[221:45.76]I'm a good person.
[221:49.57]Am I going to throw myself into a volcano?
[222:00.19]Maybe.
[222:01.25]Maybe at some point.
[222:03.15]Gollum, you know where to find him?
[222:06.71]Only if it's being recorded by a guy named George.
[222:11.10]And I saved the universe because of it.
[222:19.50]What about SpongeBob?
[222:24.34]Squidward?
[222:24.74]Everybody's a bad guy.
[222:26.22]Everybody hates fucking Squidward.
[222:27.50]He's a dick.
[222:27.94]He's an asshole.
[222:28.58]Remember when he saved SpongeBob's life in Season 4, Episode 101?
[222:35.87]And everybody started rooting for Squidward.
[222:37.09]All of a sudden you start to see Squidward memes everywhere.
[222:38.79]Every story.
[222:39.93]That was actually season five.
[222:41.23]You know, you're probably right.
[223:04.24]Don't give me an escort quest this early.
[223:06.60]Just as a G. That guy could have very easily alerted the horde, but he didn't.
[223:31.00]SpongeBob lore is awesome.
[223:32.90]Wait, what am I doing?
[223:34.86]I can summon.
[223:35.49]Okay, there we go.
[223:39.87]How do I make him do things?
[223:42.67]Can't I tell him to go do things?
[223:47.43]That's like that.
[223:48.37]Okay.
[223:49.63]I guess I figured it out.
[223:50.47]Let's go.
[223:53.78]One of the bodyguards was nearby.
[224:00.34]God damn it!
[224:02.08]Dude, I want to pick up the coin that's right next to you and it has to be the same button.
[224:08.55]Can I have another one?
[224:20.48]Whatever, it's like a one minute cooldown.
[224:22.14]Show me where to go, Donald.
[224:35.29]Poins are more important than animals.
[224:37.05]What the hell?
[224:37.55]Are they fighting spiders?
[224:38.95]I mean, look, it wasn't intentional.
[224:41.25]It's hold RB, tap RB.
[224:41.89]And sometimes you end up tapping, but it thinks you held it for a little too long.
[225:03.82]And you end up killing animals.
[225:07.91]Sorry.
[225:09.11]I wish there was more I could say.
[225:10.05]Find the victim.
[225:11.59]There he is.
[225:14.63]Can I sneak by these guys?
[225:15.83]Are they playing like... Are they playing like cards?
[225:35.87]Oh, no, gotta keep going.
[225:37.56]Where is this victim?
[225:39.20]He's up here.
[225:57.79]Careful with that neck!
[225:58.53]Careful with that neck!
[225:59.89]Who else wants to ride the ride, you?
[226:03.77]Okay.
[226:04.11]No, I fucked it up.
[226:05.25]Get over here.
[226:28.33]Okay.
[226:29.23]Investigate the body.
[226:32.69]Is this for honor?
[226:33.45]Yeah.
[226:33.69]Could be.
[226:34.29]Where's the person that's supposed to be here?
[226:37.51]Is it a guy that's just sitting here?
[226:39.77]Oh, he's up there.
[226:40.73]Okay.
[226:56.95]That's so much fun.
[226:58.03]I love just throwing, guys.
[226:58.93]Find the nearby Gondorian artifact.
[227:11.34]I kind of don't care about the Gondorian artifact.
[227:14.26]I mean, there it is.
[227:16.68]I didn't care, but now I do care.
[227:17.84]Speaking of Star Wars, this is like the rebel symbol.
[227:26.11]Mm-hmm.
[227:27.31]Find them all to unlock the Prospector skill.
[227:30.66]Find eleven.
[227:31.72]God, what is this?
[227:32.26]Okay.
[227:32.38]Okay.
[227:51.16]Well, if I feel like going to bed, I'll listen to that.
[227:53.40]Alright, where are you, Gollum?
[227:55.22]Let's go!
[227:55.50]Come on, Bright Master.
[227:56.16]You're sorry, Bright Master.
[227:57.70]Oh, stupid oxes!
[228:22.66]I can't do it.
[228:33.59]I'm trying.
[228:34.37]I can't do it.
[228:42.86]It's kind of okay.
[228:43.88]It was fairly far away.
[228:47.00]That was like somebody had their hands around Gollum's neck.
[228:53.92]Feed the patrol.
[228:54.78]How many are there?
[228:56.99]We got one, two, three, four, five.
[228:58.65]Well, that's not what I wanted to do.
[229:18.97]Oh shit.
[229:20.21]Oh shit, Gollum.
[229:22.11]Gollum may be in a little bit of trouble.
[229:27.16]Gollum.
[229:29.20]Gollum, you need to move.
[229:38.63]Alright.
[229:43.09]What's going on?
[229:46.97]Stealth Gollum.
[229:48.65]I cut his arm off.
[229:49.70]He's dead, right?
[229:53.94]Oh, this is... I gotta get away from Gollum here.
[229:55.86]I'm gonna accidentally throw a knife into Gollum's head.
[230:01.78]I do have another Caragor, though, so that's good.
[230:05.18]That was a good thing.
[230:09.58]Goodbye.
[230:20.13]Stab.
[230:21.91]Stab him.
[230:26.14]Oh, come on, dude.
[230:26.84]Really?
[230:29.86]Execute him.
[230:30.60]You have so many opportunities to execute him.
[230:38.45]He's camoed.
[230:44.88]Do I like the sight of my own blood?
[230:47.66]No.
[230:48.96]But I am gonna summon.
[230:57.05]Here we go.
[231:02.05]I told you, we're going Beast Mastery this playthrough.
[231:05.39]Or at least, like, playing.
[231:09.20]Playing or playthrough, you know, I don't know if I'm gonna be the whole game on stream, but... Just throw it out.
[231:14.86]Mm-hmm.
[231:15.14]Alright, got his leg.
[231:16.40]I did like a magic move and took it.
[231:38.64]Doesn't bother me.
[231:39.44]I got a Karagor.
[231:40.48]What do you know?
[231:42.10]That was the perfect timing.
[231:43.96]Yeah, yeah.
[231:44.64]Press R to view the Assassin's traits.
[232:05.47]The assassin has a fear of more guy flies.
[232:08.73]Preying on his fear will temporarily disable any immunity he has.
[232:11.84]Use this knowledge against him.
[232:13.72]Mark this guy.
[232:15.24]Okay.
[232:20.34]I do... I guess maybe you learn it later.
[232:23.29]But I... I like the fact that I don't have to... I want to not blow their heads up every time.
[232:32.65]He is...
[232:35.91]Vulnerable to execution.
[232:37.91]He's heavily damaged by beasts.
[232:39.93]That's a good thing for me.
[232:40.91]And he's afraid of flies.
[232:44.09]You got it.
[232:46.89]Can you do the double jump with the horse?
[232:52.52]There's a fly nest somewhere around here, right?
[232:54.90]Right there.
[232:59.04]If you're that afraid of flies, why would you stand underneath a nest?
[233:14.10]I'm so scared of bees.
[233:15.38]Let me hang out underneath one.
[233:17.02]Poisonous Dark Assassin.
[233:21.62]Easy.
[233:21.72]Kill him with another swing.
[233:45.81]He's very fucking accurate.
[233:47.38]He's arrow-proof too.
[233:48.78]You're not proof to this.
[234:01.69]He actually did do it.
[234:02.81]I'm going to let you guys have this one.
[234:05.84]Because he did make that noise that I'm seeing in chat.
[234:10.14]Ben again gave 50 bucks again.
[234:15.40]It says 10 out of 10 Gollum.
[234:19.83]Holy shit.
[234:23.23]You are single-handedly going to pay my mortgage.
[234:25.55]Ben Elnor
[234:32.11]with his $50,000.
[234:36.10]It's Rich Ben.
[234:42.92]Exploit of Fear, Skill Upgrade, and Death Threat.
[234:46.52]There we go.
[234:47.22]Okay, instead of gaining intel on a captain, you can order a worm to deliver a death threat to him.
[234:52.94]This creates a unique nemesis mission within the region.
[234:55.99]Sending a death threat against a captain increases his level.
[234:58.99]This makes the fight more challenging, but it also improves the quality of gear you receive when you kill him.
[235:04.51]So essentially, you're making the guy, you're leveling the guy up to fight by doing a death threat.
[235:10.85]Interesting.
[235:11.67]Okay, I need to take a break.
[235:12.93]I gotta pee.
[235:13.35]I'm gonna use the bathroom.
[235:14.85]I will be right back.
[235:15.81]We will return and continue.
[235:16.63]See you guys in like two or three minutes.
[235:17.91]I'm not safe standing there by myself, so...
[235:39.65]Let me go grab some tea.
[235:41.64]Holy shit, I've been streaming for almost four hours and I haven't gone to the bathroom.
[235:45.18]Wow.
[235:46.74]That's a first.
[235:48.08]That's actually a first.
[235:50.62]I'll be right back.
[238:04.96]Wait, what?
[239:15.04]Okay.
[239:20.95]I come back to Ben with another $50.
[239:23.15]Ben, you are a fucking madman.
[239:27.19]You've gone mad.
[239:31.09]I'm going to have to buy a plaque for some of you guys.
[239:35.68]There's going to be a plaque behind me.
[239:39.98]Here lies Ben.
[239:42.56]He gave, like, $1,400 to- wait, that means- no, hold on.
[239:47.06]I mean, like, there's a plaque that you hang on a wall, that you put on a wall, lies on the wall, like it's laying on the wall still.
[239:57.57]Cadence!
[239:58.43]Just think about my cadence when I'm talking here.
[240:03.49]No, he's very much alive.
[240:06.59]No, no, no, that's not what I was- Why is this guy so scared?
[240:11.81]Thank you so much, Ben.
[240:13.77]And to everybody that's been subbing and donating.
[240:18.09]It means a lot.
[240:19.15]You guys are fucking... You guys are all amazing.
[240:23.33]I don't really have much else to say.
[240:24.49]I'm not one of those... I'm not one of those people... Wait, where's my buddy?
[240:32.05]Oh, shit.
[240:32.59]He's over there.
[240:33.03]I gotta... I think he's dead.
[240:38.70]Online vendetta.
[240:41.44]Online ver- no, he's gone.
[240:42.96]I got distracted.
[240:45.29]Speaking of distractions, where the hell am I going?
[240:49.87]Uh, no, you people are great.
[240:51.75]You guys are awesome.
[240:54.07]I very much appreciate everything that you guys do for me.
[240:56.25]Because you do a lot.
[240:58.57]Even if you don't even know it.
[240:59.81]So.
[241:01.51]Okay.
[241:03.60]Let's open this up.
[241:05.10]Just because it's right there.
[241:15.09]How long am I going to stream?
[241:16.81]Probably for another couple, two or three hours.
[241:20.29]Because obviously I'm having a lot of fun in this game.
[241:24.51]You guys have not gotten very many streams recently just because I've been all over the place.
[241:28.95]So I want to go for a good six or seven hours tonight.
[241:34.11]Get to the top of the tower.
[241:44.90]And plus, next weekend I'm going to be in TwitchCon, so I'm going to try to give you guys some longer streams before I leave.
[241:50.31]And we get to do the hidden object game again.
[242:00.85]I don't hate this, though, because this...
[242:07.78]They could just be on the... You know what?
[242:09.26]I do hate this.
[242:09.80]Because they could just put them on the screen for you.
[242:13.89]It could just be a legend that you look at in the map menu.
[242:19.29]Hates a strong word, but... I mean, this feels a little like a tacked-on dumb feature that doesn't need to exist.
[242:24.99]But it's still cool to scroll around and look at stuff.
[242:28.76]I guess.
[242:33.42]I guess.
[242:33.68]I guess.
[242:37.24]Is it going to be longer than Cuphead?
[242:39.82]Well, I only streamed Cuphead for like four and a half hours the first night.
[242:44.28]That's because I had to get on a plane the next day, so... I would have loved to have beat Cuphead in one stream.
[242:51.96]But it just didn't happen.
[242:56.16]There we go.
[243:02.27]The blue filter is really annoying.
[243:05.29]Yeah, it is.
[243:05.75]So what do we got?
[243:11.13]There are too many pieces on this board game.
[243:14.36]Jesus Christ.
[243:17.50]Online... Avenge the death of... Ex-Evil by killing... I don't even know who that is.
[243:23.10]Is that one of my Steam friends?
[243:25.90]I don't think I've logged into my Steam account for my friends list in like 8 years.
[243:29.94]Alright, well let's go avenge Mr. Evil.
[243:36.12]This is an outpost leader.
[243:38.68]Here's the actual story mission.
[243:48.31]Oh, man.
[243:53.05]Rog hunt.
[243:57.51]We're right here.
[243:59.01]It's too much.
[243:59.83]So many things.
[244:00.55]I'm going to...
[244:03.20]It's a lot of shit to do, and I love it.
[244:05.48]I love how much stuff there is to do.
[244:06.66]Haven't opened a loot box yet.
[244:10.16]So, I have not seen that to be a detriment to the game yet.
[244:15.71]Although... Mr. Conehead over here.
[244:18.71]Gonna go on an og hunt.
[244:28.94]Yeah, going for an og hunt.
[244:30.58]Wait, what am I doing?
[244:31.38]I have a friend.
[244:32.14]No, I don't.
[244:39.94]Oh, Jesus.
[244:45.81]Monument?
[244:47.95]What do I need to do about the monument here?
[244:53.11]Do I need to, like, stomp on it?
[244:56.75]Oh, God, I do.
[244:58.73]Well, that was experience.
[245:03.04]A life gem, and I'm assuming I get something.
[245:05.62]Oh...
[245:07.90]Probably get something for doing that enough times.
[245:11.28]Let's just start this.
[245:17.22]An enemy captain is leading a hunt for a grog.
[245:18.86]Reward, 1148 experience.
[245:20.12]That's Nolan North.
[245:21.04]It's huge!
[245:24.11]Kill it quick!
[245:36.00]Pretty good orders.
[245:36.82]Defeat before he kills... Okay, defeat this guy before he kills the Grog.
[245:41.62]Alright, so hold on a second.
[245:42.44]You come over here, so let me see what he's weak to.
[245:47.84]Where is he?
[245:48.78]Norag Hot Tongs.
[245:52.05]Can be killed instantly by poison.
[245:54.81]Damaged by beasts.
[245:57.35]Fear of pinning.
[245:58.45]Fear of execution.
[245:59.95]And he's damaged by ranged attacks.
[246:01.33]Okay.
[246:05.11]It's huge.
[246:05.85]Kill it.
[246:13.04]Oh, I was hoping I could get a double there.
[246:17.52]Watch out for the explosive.
[246:18.60]Watch out for the explosive.
[246:21.34]Watch out for the explosive.
[246:26.93]Oh, fuck.
[246:32.25]Well, this is gonna be easier than I thought.
[246:42.84]Don't speak so soon.
[246:50.26]Let's go.
[246:50.62]Alright, where is he at?
[246:53.74]Eat him.
[246:54.32]I wanna eat him.
[246:55.54]Eat him to end it.
[246:59.11]Aww.
[246:59.23]I wanted to fucking bite his head off.
[247:04.35]Mission complete.
[247:07.80]1148.
[247:08.40]Almost there.
[247:09.00]Advancing time.
[247:11.36]That has been resolved.
[247:13.42]Cool.
[247:17.35]Now I have a grog.
[247:19.15]This is what I wanted.
[247:20.05]Now I'm going to climb.
[247:20.85]I'm going to climb the biggest tower with the grog and see what I can do.
[247:28.75]Why am I bad at video games?
[247:29.89]I did that without a problem at all.
[247:32.64]What are you talking about?
[247:34.60]I beat Cuphead in fucking 5 hours.
[247:37.22]Find me a guy that did that.
[247:39.76]Come on.
[247:41.72]Do it.
[247:43.50]Find me a guy that beat Cuphead in like 4 hours and 80 minutes.
[247:48.13]I'll wait for you.
[247:54.97]I died 103 times.
[247:57.59]I'm waiting for you.
[248:00.83]I can find you a guy that beat it in 28 minutes.
[248:03.90]Find him!
[248:06.02]Where is he?
[248:11.10]Let's go to the mission.
[248:12.36]I can take my grog there.
[248:20.24]Vinny did it in three hours?
[248:21.43]How is Vinny doing?
[248:28.10]He's still rocking it.
[248:29.18]How's Vinny doing these days?
[248:32.74]I'm just like jumping around.
[248:35.27]That was the worst possible direction to go to get this guy.
[248:39.63]Now he's retreating.
[248:40.37]He can't even do the retreating animation.
[248:47.09]Tasty boy is back.
[248:48.13]Speaking of tasty boy.
[248:49.92]Oh, what?
[248:50.34]I want to eat the tasty guy.
[248:52.26]No, I got to eat the guy that tastes good.
[248:54.88]Don't let him get away.
[248:56.72]Don't let him get away.
[248:57.38]Eat him.
[249:04.41]Come here!
[249:06.42]No!
[249:06.96]Shit!
[249:07.26]I want to eat him!
[249:11.68]I tried to do what he did.
[249:13.18]Didn't do it.
[249:13.60]I don't think this is safe for anybody to come down.
[249:21.61]There's a champion that's right there.
[249:24.46]No.
[249:24.76]Come on down here then.
[249:34.18]Come on down to the death platform.
[249:39.32]Everyone that comes down to this platform dies.
[249:43.73]See how your confidence surges.
[249:46.01]I see how to be crumbled.
[249:56.94]Are you serious?
[249:59.46]Why can I not hurt you?
[250:03.24]That guy can't die?
[250:04.08]I'm gonna pretend to be dead.
[250:08.61]I'm scared.
[250:09.19]This guy can't be hurt.
[250:18.87]Okay, sure thing.
[250:21.33]Then I'm just gonna go over here.
[250:23.88]And then I'm gonna jump down on him.
[250:31.96]Well, that was the wrong guy.
[250:34.19]But it's alright.
[250:38.43]Why am I taking the ladder, of all things?
[250:41.93]Can I get up here, please?
[250:43.13]Is this... Is this Dark Souls?
[250:47.26]Or what?
[250:48.44]You gotta be shitting me, dude.
[250:49.48]Right in the back.
[251:00.01]What?
[251:01.81]Watch where you throw in the rocks, dude.
[251:06.37]This is not a great place to fight anybody.
[251:17.58]Just do fucking Elven mode and just end this guy's life.
[251:22.72]Super defense, man.
[251:23.56]That's fine.
[251:24.00]I'll just do it three times.
[251:38.12]I'm surprised that the Grog is still alive after all this.
[251:40.32]Time to go boom!
[251:45.76]I say then he just falls down.
[251:52.44]One more hit.
[251:53.54]Should do it.
[251:58.22]This guy, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.
[252:00.73]Come on already.
[252:01.53]Oh, did I do that?
[252:09.41]Oh, fuck you.
[252:10.19]Really?
[252:10.49]There it is.
[252:15.63]See you later.
[252:18.43]Nope, he's gonna come back to life.
[252:21.93]Well, that's fine.
[252:25.38]Won't go down this easily.
[252:30.22]He's enraged by acrobatics.
[252:35.85]Really?
[252:37.35]This guy goes to the circus and just starts fucking screaming?
[252:41.58]Fucking trapeze on us.
[252:44.48]That angers me.
[252:54.82]This is it.
[252:56.00]Just let his fucking throat be done with it.
[253:05.69]One more execution, I'll get it from this guy, and see.
[253:12.10]Holy crap, I'm still playing?
[253:13.12]Oh, yeah.
[253:15.28]I'm fun.
[253:18.36]I'm fun!
[253:21.54]I told you.
[253:23.00]When I play games that require a lot of my attention, I just say caveman terminology.
[253:28.90]I just say words that are adjectives.
[253:32.05]So if I have to focus on something, my brain has to focus on that.
[253:36.93]I'm having a good time.
[253:38.35]I'm having fun.
[253:40.23]I'm fun.
[253:42.03]Just fun.
[253:43.31]Just say the three words, the two words that matter.
[253:46.23]And just keep playing.
[253:50.33]I've got a cool weapon.
[253:51.01]I've got to go look over my weapons here.
[253:52.51]Nothing about me.
[253:56.93]I'm fun.
[253:57.39]I have a great sense of humor.
[253:59.19]Me, me, good boy.
[254:00.15]He's dead.
[254:03.76]I have not looked at the gems in a little while.
[254:07.10]There's something else here.
[254:07.88]What is that?
[254:08.36]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[254:09.74]Easy.
[254:11.44]Easy.
[254:13.44]What is it?
[254:15.04]I'm just going to throw him off.
[254:24.49]Goromband outpost.
[254:25.55]Draw out the outpost leader by killing waves of enemies.
[254:29.91]That's a lot of experience in doing it.
[254:33.15]Game fun.
[254:33.88]Play more.
[254:34.40]Game fun.
[254:35.38]Me.
[254:35.56]Fire bad.
[254:35.96]Ow.
[254:36.14]Little man.
[254:36.78]Swing big stick.
[254:38.34]Me Jerma.
[254:38.94]Me stream.
[255:02.42]Watch this fucking... Tomahawk from across the map, nuke town!
[255:11.41]What am I doing?
[255:11.99]I have to kill people here, okay.
[255:14.03]Let's drop some bugs.
[255:14.79]What am I doing?
[255:22.90]Elven mode yet?
[255:28.66]Just kill people in the outpost.
[255:30.91]Sounds easy enough.
[255:31.83]But who knows if I can do it or not.
[255:39.71]Have the shield, gotta go.
[255:42.21]Did I just block that out of mid-air?
[255:50.16]Surprising stuff here!
[255:58.05]Whoops.
[256:02.54]There's one asshole over here with a spear.
[256:04.56]Again, a guy with a fucking spear.
[256:07.52]The worst enemies.
[256:08.90]It's in every game.
[256:10.18]We talked about how George wrote the fucking story of how everything's the same story.
[256:13.80]Let's also talk about how the spear is the worst fucking weapon to ever fight against in every video game.
[256:21.57]Guy with a fucking spear is where it's at, apparently.
[256:24.27]Ay-yi-yi.
[256:28.58]What am I doing here?
[256:29.72]Oh, there he is.
[256:30.20]Snafu.
[256:31.24]Why is my screen blinking?
[256:34.19]Yeah, I thought I was getting hit during that cutscene.
[256:41.51]I was about to be really upset about that.
[256:43.03]How many intel on this guy?
[256:54.56]No.
[256:55.35]He's immune to ranged.
[256:57.07]He's enraged by executions.
[256:59.39]He's a destroyer.
[257:02.79]He's got a crossbow.
[257:03.63]He has a flame weapon.
[257:04.41]He has mines.
[257:05.47]Dear.
[257:09.77]When in doubt... When in doubt, run one out.
[257:13.36]Come over here.
[257:18.32]Come on.
[257:18.48]Attract.
[257:22.32]Walk down this way.
[257:23.00]Come on.
[257:24.68]Make your rounds.
[257:25.32]Wait, is it intel?
[257:32.88]Diving interrogate.
[257:33.86]There he is, snafu.
[257:40.40]Can be instantly killed by a beast.
[257:44.00]That's all I need to know.
[257:48.18]That's all I needed to know.
[257:52.99]You see how this beautiful weapon burns?
[257:57.33]It took a lot of effort to get it to do that.
[258:00.81]So the least you can do is let me kill you with it.
[258:04.84]Well, that's not going to happen because I'm just going to go like this.
[258:07.64]It's a fire shot.
[258:10.08]Come on, dog.
[258:11.74]And go protect your master.
[258:13.95]See you.
[258:20.89]Good boy.
[258:22.53]Good boy.
[258:24.88]I'll take a level up.
[258:30.22]That is now secure.
[258:31.52]Outpost disabled.
[258:34.54]For a second I thought that said I got 10 skill points.
[258:43.02]Let's take a look at our inventory here, because there are quite a few things I have now.
[258:49.32]Forge gem.
[258:50.10]Okay, I can do this.
[258:51.92]Should I?
[258:57.58]No, I think I have a new weapon here.
[258:59.14]Okay.
[259:00.78]Can I pull the gem out?
[259:02.42]Remove gem.
[259:07.30]So, this is just better.
[259:08.46]What about this one?
[259:09.16]Just break it.
[259:15.01]Can't break that.
[259:16.69]Why can I not break these ones?
[259:17.65]Oh, okay.
[259:17.93]Okay.
[259:19.99]Execute a captain while your health is below 25%.
[259:21.47]And I get health recovery on a crit.
[259:27.95]Vitality and wealth.
[259:29.45]Weapon... 5% increased chance that enemies killed by this weapon drop money.
[259:37.23]No.
[259:41.21]Got a new dagger, right? 231.
[259:46.38]And this is use quick throw to hit an enemy on fire.
[259:49.53]I'll do that.
[259:52.81]I can unlock this.
[259:55.55]Do I even care right now?
[260:01.68]Keep that.
[260:06.66]I have to do this.
[260:09.12]Because these unlock challenges are fairly important, I think.
[260:14.01]Look at all this crap.
[260:15.47]Just break it all down.
[260:22.39]Combine the gems.
[260:25.91]That's probably a good idea.
[260:34.61]This one's better.
[260:37.17]This is the same exact thing, just better.
[260:39.41]Should I break the other one down?
[260:48.59]Okay.
[260:50.21]Hopefully that wasn't a mistake.
[260:51.29]Alright.
[261:00.52]Forge gem.
[261:01.48]Let's do it.
[261:09.56]Whoa!
[261:09.96]What did I just do?
[261:10.94]Oh boy.
[261:12.58]Ca-
[261:14.99]Oh, okay.
[261:15.33]I understand.
[261:15.71]I get it.
[261:16.05]I get it.
[261:16.43]I get it.
[261:16.71]I get it.
[261:17.05]Just like Diablo.
[261:17.97]Just like fucking Diablo II.
[261:19.15]I get it.
[261:20.25]So now this is the one I have here.
[261:22.01]So that's the one I slot.
[261:26.77]I can do it again.
[261:27.37]I can do this too.
[261:36.91]I'll just keep those.
[261:41.96]The life ones.
[261:43.20]I like those ones.
[261:45.92]The Box of Transmute.
[261:47.92]No, no, no.
[261:49.00]It's the Haradra Cube, man.
[261:56.58]Character.
[261:57.50]Okay, skill points.
[261:59.98]Mounted.
[262:02.02]Shadow Mount.
[262:02.66]Instantly mount a broken Grog, Cargo, or Drake.
[262:06.45]Dragon Rider's skill must be unlocked with Shadow Strike.
[262:11.87]Dragon Rider.
[262:13.83]There...
[262:15.09]Well, that's a great spoiler considering I can ride a fucking dragon.
[262:21.31]And you guys didn't want me to do Beast Mastery.
[262:33.36]I don't care about anything else.
[262:36.38]You want me to fly a plane in this game?

[265:27.30]Silver war chest.
[265:31.58]Two gear pieces, at least one rare.
[265:40.25]This is fucking dumb.
[265:43.27]I just like, I just, I just replaced all of my weapons because I pressed A. Well, that was fun.
[265:52.38]Remind me to never do that again.
[266:09.28]This is better than a legendary.
[266:10.57]That's a level 10 eye.
[266:11.83]Okay, this one at least is a little worse.
[266:18.87]Yeah, it is.
[266:23.80]Fun.
[266:26.44]Having fun yet?
[266:29.20]Funny story about my father.
[266:31.74]So, my father used to do, like, yard work back in the day.
[266:35.16]And he would be mowing the lawn.
[266:36.35]He'd be out there...
[266:38.91]You know, ripping up weeds and shit.
[266:41.13]And every time he was out there, my neighbor, who was the person that lived right next door, would come over to him while he was working and be like, Hey, having fun yet?
[266:52.39]And he'd be like, yeah.
[266:54.81]And he would come inside and tell me about it.
[266:56.21]He'd be like, that motherfucker over there just seriously says that every time.
[266:59.23]It's like, no, it's not fun doing yard work.
[267:00.86]He would say it every time.
[267:02.62]Literally every single time my father was doing yard work, this guy would come over like Wilson from that 70s show.
[267:08.70]What was the guy with the guy that put his face behind the fence?
[267:13.85]And he would just be like, hey, having fun yet?
[267:18.56]What was his name?
[267:19.51]The guy from Tool Time.
[267:24.81]That guy, Wilson from Tool Time, that puts his face over the fence.
[267:31.07]That's my father every day.
[267:33.73]And you can just see the rage in my father's face when he'd come back in the house.
[267:36.70]Let's activate this.
[267:44.70]Purify the demons.
[267:51.10]We're too young to get that joke.
[267:52.64]I don't think so.
[267:57.03]Not this again.
[268:00.33]All I'm doing here is adding clutter to my map.
[268:03.31]That's all this does.
[268:08.01]I'm just putting a bunch of fucking random icons.
[268:14.63]doing it's gonna confuse me and I'm gonna get angry one more why was the story brought up uh because somebody said how you like having fun yet because of the loot boxes oh this is fun fun huh fun yet I don't know just kind of scratched my brain for a second why do you remember anything
[268:41.90]Because you smell something.
[268:42.68]You know like smell is tied to memory more than sight or hearing?
[268:47.27]If you breathe in something that stinks, it triggers your memory.
[268:50.75]Memory is tied more to scent than any of your other senses.
[268:54.17]Look it up.
[268:57.57]So somebody must have said having fun yet, and I must have smelled like fresh cut grass somehow.
[269:01.83]Where is this last one?
[269:06.79]Where's the last one?
[269:07.81]Come on.
[269:12.39]There's one more.
[269:14.97]Where have I not looked?
[269:15.89]Are you kidding me?
[269:20.07]It's at the top of this tower somewhere.
[269:29.53]Let's go, buddy.
[269:33.71]So... Let's do some stuff.
[269:41.29]Do you see what I'm talking about?
[269:43.07]All I did is add shit.
[269:45.41]We'll do the story.
[269:46.37]We'll go to the story mission.
[269:47.59]No man's land.
[269:49.59]The orc army is launching their attacks from Sirith Ungol.
[269:52.11]Join Baranor and take the fight to Mordor.
[269:55.81]Is there a fast travel right here?
[269:59.54]It's like the same amount of distance, whatever.
[270:09.28]That kills anybody.
[270:11.46]Got another skill to unlock?
[270:16.43]Mounted.
[270:17.83]Devouring enemies while in stealth restores more of your Karagor's health.
[270:22.25]Hmm.
[270:23.29]Maybe later.
[270:26.66]But we'll do the perfect counter.
[270:27.68]It's important.
[270:34.92]Let's move!
[270:39.95]It's a fellow Karagor, but I don't care.
[270:41.39]I have my Karagor.
[270:43.17]He's at full health.
[270:45.19]Well, let's test that theory.
[270:50.93]Rip his throat out.
[270:52.95]Well, that was a pretty graceful... I fell off my horse and landed on your throat.
[271:02.53]Then you died.
[271:11.19]I wish I could go faster here.
[271:12.33]No, I wanted to fucking intelligence.
[271:16.74]I wanted to get the intelligence from that guy.
[271:21.02]Whatever.
[271:27.44]Whatever works, right?
[271:30.22]It's not a horse.
[271:30.92]It's a horse to me.
[271:35.02]Wrong way.
[271:38.79]I wanted this brain.
[271:39.53]I did.
[271:43.48]Sauron's forces keep growing.
[271:45.54]The Gondorians will need to push deeper into Mordor.
[271:53.64]No man's land, the orc army, yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go.
[271:57.32]Absorb his IQ, just drain him.
[272:00.36]Baranor.
[272:02.32]You can't have run out of orcs in the city.
[272:05.32]Hey Reaper, thanks for the five, Reaper 500, thanks for the 500.
[272:07.86]Thanks for the five bucks.
[272:13.36]Jerma, I don't know if you know this, but the main part of this game is recruiting orcs into your army and then taking down fortresses.
[272:19.02]That's why you got orcs in the loot box.
[272:22.10]The siege gameplay is outstanding, especially if you sabotage the defenses beforehand.
[272:27.05]I'm ready.
[272:27.47]I'm getting ready for it.
[272:29.39]Yeah.
[272:30.27]I saw the trailer.
[272:32.03]I saw the trailer.
[272:32.69]I understand.
[272:36.35]Yeah.
[272:37.75]I'm looking forward.
[272:38.37]I told you.
[272:38.71]At the very beginning, we talked about Clash of Clans.
[272:42.17]We made that joke a few times.
[272:43.15]I don't have to go back to that joke.
[272:44.21]We've already said it.
[272:46.05]But also, thank you, Sticks Renegade, for the five bucks.
[272:47.53]Here's some money for a monocle.
[272:48.77]I think a monocle is way more than $5.
[272:50.94]I think it's like $500 per monocle.
[272:54.72]But I'm not gonna... What am I, the fucking Monopoly man?
[272:57.47]Wait a minute.
[272:57.87]No, that's not true.
[272:59.78]You know, the Monopoly man never had a monocle.
[273:02.00]It's just for some reason we all think that.
[273:03.40]We all remember that.
[273:04.51]There's a theory that states it's called the Mandela Effect, where you think, like, for instance, Froot Loops is spelled differently than you remember.
[273:16.67]Always the Monopoly guy.
[273:17.57]No, the Monopoly guy doesn't have a monocle.
[273:20.38]I remember him having a monocle.
[273:23.80]It's a multiverse technology thing.
[273:25.62]Go look it up.
[273:26.18]You'll see it.
[273:26.52]It's called the Mandela Effect.
[273:29.02]Fruit Loops is not spelled that way.
[273:30.66]It's not like Fruit Loops.
[273:32.64]It's F-R-O-O-T.
[273:36.92]No, it's not that.
[273:38.30]Just look it up.
[273:40.39]I gotta play the Warchief game.
[273:41.87]I can't talk to you about the Mandela Effect.
[273:46.29]Anyways, thanks.
[273:48.37]Thank you, Modest Narcissist for the $5.
[273:50.59]You good stream, me fun.
[273:52.19]Thank you.
[273:55.01]Yeah, the Warchief's from the first game.
[273:56.31]I remember that.
[273:58.52]Mm-hmm.
[274:00.83]You gotta break down their defenses.
[274:03.19]They have a bunch of friends that they walk around with, and I think the game froze.
[274:07.67]Yes, it did.
[274:08.99]Did it?
[274:09.39]No, this game... It didn't.
[274:14.59]God damn it, did it?
[274:19.96]Fuck, it froze.
[274:21.42]No!
[274:25.46]I don't believe that for a second.
[274:27.87]It didn't freeze.
[274:28.45]Here we are.
[274:28.83]That was weird.
[274:41.99]It's the Mandela Effect.
[274:43.05]You guys don't remember.
[274:43.79]I held down the button.
[274:47.64]The war chiefs of this region are the leaders of the Orc army.
[274:51.20]By selecting a war chief, you can see his bodyguards.
[274:53.30]Mm-hmm.
[274:56.18]Hunt and defeat a warchief's bodyguards before confronting the warchief himself to make defeating him easier.
[275:00.85]Help Baron or hunt and kill his bodyguard.
[275:07.01]Okay, grunk.
[275:07.83]Oh, watch out for grunk.
[275:12.14]We're gonna get... We're gonna get crunk with grunk!
[275:16.00]What's this new summon that I have?
[275:18.98]I have two, um... Two things here.
[275:25.63]What's that second amount?
[275:30.23]Baranor stealth kills?
[275:34.69]So I have to let Baranor stealth kill enemies?
[275:39.23]While you are undetected, you can command an ally or your summoned bodyguard to kill a nearby target.
[275:44.66]Aim at an enemy and press that.
[275:46.32]Okay.
[275:47.82]That's how you command Baranor.
[275:49.20]Alright.
[275:52.44]Go get him, Baranor.
[275:57.68]I mean, I didn't tell him to do that, but he did it anyways.
[275:59.80]Okay, go get him, Baranor.
[276:05.29]This music is kind of unfitting right now.
[276:12.75]I don't even have to play the game.
[276:19.59]I just need to get a couple more stealth kills.
[276:32.23]There's the trail.
[276:33.79]I need to get a couple more stealth kills.
[276:36.13]Go stealth kill him.
[276:39.26]That was kind of ridiculous that you were able to do that.
[276:42.30]Why wouldn't you just do that from far away every time?
[276:50.46]That guy just saw you walk in front of his face.
[276:53.96]That guy saw you from a mile away.
[277:00.15]Drop down and kill him.
[277:03.57]This guy's better than me at this game.
[277:09.09]No, I'll help him from afar.
[277:17.08]I think I just hit him in the back.
[277:21.26]Alright, let's go, come on.
[277:23.66]No, let's go, let's go, come on.
[277:34.19]I mean, you guys know what I'm trying to do here, right?
[277:35.91]I have to see if it's possible.
[277:39.99]I'm going to have to dismount here, because this is very important.
[277:42.46]I want to see if this guy can get blown away by the wind.
[277:49.00]Just wedging between the dog.
[277:54.60]And now the geyser doesn't want to turn on.
[277:59.26]Why?
[278:05.51]That's all it does.
[278:06.25]Okay, well that was fun.
[278:13.19]Focus up.
[278:14.53]Focus.
[278:15.31]Focus!
[278:18.57]Those dog prints.
[278:22.03]Who's getting too far away?
[278:24.95]What are you talking about?
[278:26.23]This guy's getting too far away.
[278:37.50]Don't hit that.
[278:38.08]It's gonna explode if you hit that.
[278:39.48]Let's go.
[278:44.40]This guy's getting too far away.
[278:45.54]Where is he?
[278:45.96]I don't even know where he is.
[278:47.62]Definitely gonna get that guy.
[278:49.16]Alright, Baromir, we gotta go.
[278:55.00]I would love to spend a bunch of time running around in circles, but... Me and Baromir are gonna move.
[279:04.18]He's already done stealth kills.
[279:05.50]It doesn't even matter anymore.
[279:06.42]Mission failed?
[279:13.69]I'm not going to fail the mission.
[279:18.65]He's on the... There he is.
[279:23.77]Soft target.
[279:25.75]Exhaustion.
[279:27.53]He's not enraged.
[279:31.34]He has no extreme weaknesses, I mean the beast thing, but why would he have beast vulnerabilities when he's riding a beast?
[279:37.15]Seems weird.
[279:39.95]Agile.
[279:41.61]And he's enraged by injury.
[279:44.81]Well, I'm not gonna wait for Baromir.
[279:49.72]Why do we need to wait for Baromir?
[279:59.22]Sneak around the side.
[280:12.33]Just have him jousting that.
[280:19.24]Broken!
[280:21.76]No, I summoned another Karagorov.
[280:23.20]That's alright.
[280:34.01]Alright, we're doing good.
[280:39.89]Just tear into him.
[280:45.40]Alright, for a second I thought this was sponsored.
[280:55.04]Oh no, he's sponsored now.
[280:56.94]That means he does 20% more damage.
[281:06.29]I can't say I'm happy that he's right here, because this guy's gonna die.
[281:09.19]Get out of the way, dude.
[281:09.85]Let a fucking real man step in, please.
[281:15.86]Just kill the fucking dog.
[281:18.98]Alright, ballroom here.
[281:19.74]Get him.
[281:21.50]The spear out of his neck.
[281:23.64]The way he was standing there with the spear out of his neck.
[281:29.26]He's just like, oh yeah, this is alright.
[281:31.22]This will work.
[281:32.96]I wish he would get out of the way, because he really is gonna make this harder.
[281:46.00]Please, no.
[281:46.86]No, dude, don't, don't.
[281:48.30]Please die.
[281:49.50]You're not gonna make me start this over because this idiot is just getting hit by every fucking arrow.
[281:58.79]No, we did it.
[282:00.01]Defeat the bodyguard, he's dead.
[282:05.35]I almost feel sorry for the warchief we're hunting.
[282:08.58]You'll be lonely without his bodyguards.
[282:10.94]Did he shout, you missed me?
[282:12.04]Yeah.
[282:12.18]Look at the rat, look at the rat, look at the rat.
[282:24.81]This is the orc leadership stuff.
[282:30.41]Without its leaders, the armies of the Dark Lord will be in disarray.
[282:32.75]Draw out and defeat the war chiefs by undertaking confrontation missions.
[282:37.60]Soldiers from Minas Ithil have been sent to help you defeat the Warchiefs.
[282:42.34]Call on Gondorian followers to your side.
[282:46.40]How many do I get?
[282:47.35]Three.
[282:47.53]Tweedle-lee, Tweedle-dum, and Tweedle-loo.
[283:03.36]Terrible life.
[283:05.38]Let me, like, remove you from this fucking mortal coil.
[283:10.40]Can't get in there.
[283:15.17]Alright, let's do it.
[283:18.97]Let's keep it up.
[283:20.05]What's the next thing?
[283:21.77]New.
[283:24.55]Okay.
[283:30.73]This is so big.
[283:33.26]This is so expansive, it's kind of hurting me.
[283:40.88]Where is this place?
[283:44.78]Oh, it's down here.
[283:45.38]Okay.
[283:47.44]Return to Shelob to learn more threats.
[283:50.97]Let's destroy this.
[283:51.71]I'm standing right next to it.
[283:58.77]Goodbye.
[284:05.48]I just threw a dagger at that guy.
[284:07.42]I didn't even mean to.
[284:10.82]Oh, great.
[284:12.74]All my moron friends are over here.
[284:14.74]Don't worry.
[284:16.67]Let me help you out, guys.
[284:24.41]End the stream.
[284:25.05]Don't have it be on.
[284:25.81]Wait, why not?
[284:28.25]Alright, forget about them.
[284:34.39]Forget about those Gondorians.
[284:36.16]I like the slide.
[284:40.88]That slide's fun.
[284:41.38]I gotta use it more often.
[284:44.54]Like that.
[284:46.78]What's this game even all about?
[284:47.84]It's about Lord of the Rings.
[284:49.98]And about taking over Gondor.
[284:53.76]Or Shelob.
[284:55.56]Shelob has the ring now.
[284:57.72]So we have to make an army to destroy all the castles.
[285:03.51]Shelob will have to confront us in the end when we take... because she wants to try to weaken the realm for her.
[285:11.75]We take the ring off her finger in the end, and then it's paid DLC to fight Sauron.
[285:20.94]Oh wait, no, sorry, that was the last one.
[285:23.18]What happened in this game?
[285:27.89]This guy's back.
[285:28.53]I only have one, two guys?
[285:29.79]Okay.
[285:32.81]I'm gonna keep going.
[285:33.56]Let's keep moving.
[285:40.46]My biggest complaint for that last game was that ending.
[285:45.77]The end of Shadow of Mordor was a quick time event.
[285:49.81]You walked up and pressed X.
[285:53.40]That was it.
[285:54.89]And then you had to actually get the DLC to finish the game.
[286:00.91]It's actually kind of bullshit if you think about it.
[286:06.90]The boss battles seem more fun in this one.
[286:08.24]I hope so.
[286:09.70]Yeah, that ending quick time event, I was floored that that was the end of the game.
[286:23.15]What have we got so far?
[286:24.11]We got Reign of Arrows.
[286:27.92]Learn more from Shelob.
[286:32.46]Halo 4 also ended in the QTE.
[286:34.08]And what about what I want?
[286:34.90]Justice.
[286:35.58]Didn't they have to rush to finish the game?
[286:52.73]Probably something like that.
[286:54.19]This game has epic bosses.
[286:59.39]Can't wait to see them.
[287:02.56]God damn it.
[287:03.24]I hate that shit.
[287:04.06]Fucking dumbass ice cubes.
[287:07.08]You know when you're drinking a drink and you have a bunch of ice cubes in it?
[287:19.22]And the ice cubes get small enough where you can accidentally just swallow the glass.
[287:25.02]I just swallowed like three shards of glass because they were little ice cubes that have melted and I like... I hate that.
[287:31.18]Yeah, it's the worst.
[287:49.40]What was that noise?
[287:52.86]That was... I have a little coffee here.
[287:55.87]I'm drinking coffee at midnight.
[287:57.61]What a psycho.
[288:00.35]What a sicko.
[288:03.03]Just drinking coffee at 11.30, 12 o'clock at night.
[288:07.05]I got a long shift ahead of me.
[288:11.22]I'm living like the... You know what?
[288:12.78]I'm doing the truck driver lifestyle.
[288:15.91]Stop at, like, Honeydew Donuts at 2 o'clock in the morning with a truckload of cargo, and I'm just driving on the highway for nine more hours.
[288:24.13]Drinking iced coffee.
[288:28.81]I gotta be in Indianapolis at fucking 7 a.m.
[288:31.76]I want two large black coffees.
[288:33.32]No cream, no sugar in those.
[288:34.38]Make it snappy.
[288:43.22]It's just showing off.
[288:43.76]That's all it was.
[288:44.24]Hello!
[288:44.38]Reporting this stream for staying up past bedtime.
[289:06.16]I won't turn down an extra sword.
[289:07.48]Then we shall take him down together.
[289:10.35]I'll take out his archers first.
[289:11.59]Is this the first boss fight of the game?
[289:16.89]Is this the first Warchief man?
[289:18.85]Defeat the archers without raising the alarm.
[289:20.37]Oh, great.
[289:21.43]Not one of these.
[289:23.43]Not one of these again.
[289:25.67]Last time when you played this game, the old one, the prequel, the one that this is a sequel to.
[289:34.11]If you fail the mission, you fail the life.
[289:37.10]You have to start over.
[289:37.92]It's not fun.
[289:43.66]This is considered like a stealth kill, right?
[289:45.06]This is gonna be good.
[289:46.82]Right in the head.
[290:03.20]This is why I picked the bow, guys.
[290:04.36]Because I'm fairly accurate with the bow.
[290:07.67]I can do a fairly good job.
[290:08.97]See, there's the guy's head.
[290:09.89]Right that little cube.
[290:10.81]That little fucking cube right there.
[290:12.17]I can go.
[290:15.83]That guy in the porta potty.
[290:18.51]Don't even need to see it.
[290:20.75]I just need to know exactly the location he could be in.
[290:32.45]An elven archer would be worth three Gondorian archers.
[290:36.47]Really?
[290:37.33]Only three?
[290:39.57]Fuck.
[290:40.47]He dodged all those.
[290:47.42]Oh, now I don't know what to do.
[290:48.80]There's no more arrows.
[290:51.60]Stop it.
[290:52.00]Get off.
[290:52.92]Get off the ledge, you dummy.
[290:54.02]What are you trying to do here?
[290:59.32]Where are these guys?
[291:00.46]One up there, one over there.
[291:01.50]I could have made that so much easier for myself.
[291:07.22]Can I climb this?
[291:12.60]Oh, boy.
[291:13.18]That's not what I wanted to do.
[291:17.08]I thought that was going to call Baramir over here.
[291:19.87]Or Baramor.
[291:20.49]Baranor.
[291:22.27]They all have the same name.
[291:25.75]Baranor.
[291:26.39]Faranor.
[291:26.95]Faramir.
[291:27.49]Baranir.
[291:28.58]Garonir.
[291:29.70]Sauronor.
[291:30.68]Sauron.
[291:31.32]Saruman.
[291:31.90]Even the two characters that are opposite, like the wizards.
[291:34.50]Sauron.
[291:35.78]Saruman.
[291:38.65]Fucking written by a guy named George.
[291:40.73]It's all the same.
[291:49.25]You guys can't do that, so you guys are going to like... Oh, wow, that was impressive.
[291:52.62]We can't do that, though.
[291:53.64]I need an arrow.
[291:56.56]I'm just going to go around the edges.
[292:07.34]My dickhead friends are going to ruin everything.
[292:12.77]What are you doing up here?
[292:24.73]Why am I doing this to these guys?
[292:30.55]He won't fall off.
[292:31.55]Whatever.
[292:31.91]I tried.
[292:38.71]Huh?
[292:41.34]Where are they going?
[292:42.16]They're like ants.
[292:46.36]Nobody's doing anything.
[292:47.28]No one's raising any alarms.
[293:01.91]Why did I do that?
[293:03.37]It was funny for a second, and now it's going to cause a huge amount of problems.
[293:10.19]Just kill the archers, hurry.
[293:11.43]That guy was trying to impress me.
[293:20.40]You know what I mean?
[293:21.02]That guy was trying so hard to show off in front of me.
[293:25.30]Oh, Faramir is watching.
[293:26.90]I better make it cool.
[293:28.18]I better do a good job.
[293:40.18]Never underestimate men fighting to protect their home.
[293:43.80]This is not their home.
[293:51.79]Last guy.
[293:53.61]Don't let him touch an alarm.
[293:59.91]Get up.
[294:00.43]Climb it.
[294:01.67]Climb it.
[294:04.58]Climb it and then change direction.
[294:08.62]Climb it.
[294:09.28]Change.
[294:11.02]There it is.
[294:11.98]Reach the vantage point without raising the alarm.
[294:14.97]Okay.
[294:15.09]Climate.
[294:15.31]Change.
[294:32.38]And we've got something real to talk about.
[294:33.58]Look, I was trying to think of something else to say, and there's nothing there.
[294:38.23]Reach the vantage point without alerting any... What did I just throw that at?
[294:45.13]Oh, shit!
[294:46.41]No way!
[294:47.41]Why?
[294:47.73]No, no, no, no, no.
[294:52.53]I threw a fucking random dagger at someone.
[294:57.50]even throw it at.
[294:58.44]Fucking climate change.
[295:01.88]Funny topical politic joke.
[295:09.47]Get to the vantage point.
[295:10.47]Here I am.
[295:12.41]Summon the Gondorians.
[295:18.90]Here's Grisha.
[295:25.06]Whoops.
[295:25.50]My phone and I fucked up.
[295:33.73]Nothing is sweeter.
[295:35.71]Together, we will crush their defenses.
[295:38.65]Grisha the Heartless, Dark Destroyer.
[295:40.74]Together, as captains in war, we will have victory.
[295:46.42]Am I going to sneak in there?
[295:48.10]Wait.
[295:48.48]Oh, they're up top.
[296:14.47]What?
[296:15.19]Shoot somebody.
[296:24.28]There is them rings of power.
[296:27.04]Punish you.
[296:31.17]I see you at the bottom of a watery grave.
[296:35.73]I'm on fire behind him.
[296:38.65]Oh, no!
[296:40.81]Don't watch your back.
[296:42.03]There's fire over here.
[296:43.53]That was perfect.
[296:44.73]Everything he does explodes.
[296:59.48]Wait!
[297:02.94]Come on, this my dog!
[297:10.01]Dazed.
[297:10.99]And.
[297:11.43]Confused.
[297:12.43]He.
[297:13.33]Ain't.
[297:13.95]Making it.
[297:15.01]Ow.
[297:15.63]Oh.
[297:16.45]This.
[297:16.91]Alive!
[297:21.86]Comical immolation.
[297:25.97]There's a legendary.
[297:37.76]There's rare weapons and shit.
[297:39.20]Okay, you deal with him for a minute.
[297:40.22]I'm going to collect these items.
[297:45.06]There's items and shit over here.
[297:47.01]Gotta pick them up.
[297:47.91]I don't leave anything behind as long as it's safe as it is.
[297:52.71]Let's go.
[297:53.13]I want to end this with a good, like... I thought I just took off that guy's head on the left.
[298:03.88]I was about to be very upset about that.
[298:07.42]I'd say we're even.
[298:10.59]Oh, man.
[298:20.93]I loved that so much.
[298:23.40]It was like a perfectly framed shot of him coming out and in and out of frame.
[298:31.06]We cannot see your lens.
[298:33.94]We must return to Shiloh.
[298:37.76]I feel like I'm going to look like that when I get older.
[298:45.97]You want this game, but you want the orcs to be Warhammer orcs.
[298:54.21]The orcs are fun in this game.
[298:55.15]They're funny.
[298:56.49]They're interesting.
[298:56.95]They have personality.
[298:59.65]You can just walk around and sneak around in this game and listen to thousands of lines of dialogue that have been recorded.
[299:07.87]Explosion.
[299:08.41]A bomb just flew up.
[299:13.39]Gotta get the ring.
[299:14.55]Alright, I have... For instance, this is what I'm talking about.
[299:19.73]Let's listen in.
[299:42.33]That wasn't a good example, but there are examples.
[299:47.49]Oh, get back down.
[300:13.88]I want to read the bulletin.
[300:16.82]Yeah, what do we got?
[300:21.86]Unknown captain.
[300:23.88]Unknown war chief revealed.
[300:26.18]That's the war chief.
[300:29.68]Mortally flammable.
[300:30.58]Fear of poison.
[300:31.55]Damage by range attacks.
[300:33.75]This is a war chief, guys.
[300:35.19]This fucking... This fucking piece of maggoty bread for only three stinking hours.
[300:42.65]That was a fucking softball.
[300:44.03]I want a Karagor again.
[300:48.88]I'm starving.
[300:50.42]We did this last stream.
[300:53.72]I don't have to do it again.
[301:16.98]Get away from me.
[301:18.84]Fucking George Lucas.
[301:22.38]More like George Loogie.
[301:25.06]I could spit up a better script than that.
[301:27.99]Just a tight.
[301:33.57]I'm going to do it again.
[301:39.45]Because let's just pretend I didn't do that last stream.
[301:42.63]What about the legs?
[301:44.23]They don't need those.
[301:46.66]Get back, scum.
[301:49.42]Oh, just a taste.
[301:52.03]Just a taste, you fucking wanker.
[301:58.79]What about this guy?
[302:00.79]Now that's a real warchief.
[302:02.95]He's sickly.
[302:03.55]He's old.
[302:04.89]He's damaged by ranged attacks.
[302:08.94]They are not for eating.
[302:12.62]What about the legs?
[302:13.30]I can do it again.
[302:18.14]I'm gonna do it again.
[302:27.13]What about the legs?
[302:29.01]Are there any else?
[302:39.17]Oh, look, a thing!
[302:40.01]A magical device!
[302:41.93]Wow!
[302:42.59]Yahoo!
[302:43.17]Oh, boy.
[302:45.25]Where is it?
[302:46.55]Where is it?
[302:47.25]Where is it?
[302:47.81]There it is.
[302:50.19]Where?
[302:50.61]There it is.
[302:53.05]Excuse me.
[302:53.85]Let's take a look.
[302:55.96]That's, that, okay, that was just a fire.
[302:57.84]That was wrong.
[303:00.00]There it is.
[303:00.44]I don't even know why I'm doing this.
[303:05.78]Nothing.
[303:08.03]Michael Caine, or Michael Caine, or... Let me tell you something.
[303:12.53]Michael Caine just wants to be an orc.
[303:16.23]If you can't be an orc, Bruce, it's just not going to happen.
[303:21.50]What about the elects?
[303:23.12]They don't need those, Bruce.
[303:25.70]It's just, it's not going to happen, mate.
[303:28.85]Thank you.
[303:29.41]I'm sorry, I haven't...
[303:40.70]Oh, what a stream, huh?
[303:45.59]-2 of content.
[303:49.25]Bugs!
[303:49.49]Oh, no!
[303:49.63]Bug alert!
[303:50.07]I've lost all control.
[303:51.11]Where am I going?
[303:51.57]What about the legs?
[303:52.11]They don't need those.
[303:53.65]Roach, they don't need those.
[304:09.97]I give up.
[304:10.73]My brain is, like, fried right now.
[304:14.43]Brutalize, that's what I want.
[304:15.31]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[304:17.65]Am I alright?
[304:18.17]I've never been better.
[304:19.25]I'm having a blast.
[304:23.98]I just keep picturing Michael Caine being that orc.
[304:28.94]But he's not in any orc makeup.
[304:31.74]It's just Michael Caine.
[304:33.80]So all these fucked up orcs are like, Get out of the way, scum!
[304:36.64]And Michael Caine's just there in a suit.
[304:45.65]Bruce, we need to cook.
[304:51.94]We need to cook.
[304:52.92]What is it, fucking Breaking Bad?
[304:54.30]That guy was a wrestler.
[304:56.94]That guy was just in default underwear.
[305:00.85]First name, last name, WWE.
[305:08.61]What is underneath here?
[305:12.57]Someone save me.
[305:13.49]What is that?
[305:14.03]There's a red gem there.
[305:20.03]Holy shit.
[305:23.99]I just scared the fuck out of this guy, except for the fat boy.
[305:27.20]Nothing scares you.
[305:29.86]But it should.
[305:32.76]Yeah, you got scared too, didn't ya?
[305:35.34]Oh yeah, buh-bye, no docks.
[305:36.34]Ooh, it's a red gem.
[306:01.65]this game.
[306:02.43]It's fun just to run around and be a psycho.
[306:07.01]Hey, I'm a pretty cool guy.
[306:08.07]Thanks, I appreciate that.
[306:10.15]You're a pretty cool person too.
[306:21.84]Why did we fall, Master Bruce?
[306:23.98]So we can eat dead eggs.
[306:24.98]I love it.
[306:32.61]Looks like Doritos are back on the menu, boys.
[306:38.40]Can I say anything else besides like random voices like right now?
[306:41.52]That's all I'm doing.
[306:42.48]I'm just sitting here doing random like shit impressions.
[306:50.60]Let's go do this.
[306:52.36]This mission.
[306:54.54]Wow, look at all these guys.
[306:59.44]Look at all these wrestlers.
[307:01.24]Oh, that was $100.
[307:02.52]Here's your $100 joke.
[307:03.22]They're all going off the cliff.
[307:06.88]They're all going off.
[307:07.56]Learn to fly, fucking asshole.
[307:12.83]I like the red gems.
[307:18.99]The red ones are punchy.
[307:27.19]Why is that guy fighting?
[307:28.35]Why are they in a fight right now?
[307:33.19]I can't really begin to explain to you what that one-on-one is going on up there for.
[307:39.08]But it looks like Underwear Man is gonna be... Hey, you won!
[307:42.68]Here's your prize!
[307:43.40]Okay.
[307:46.64]Okay.
[307:48.36]Rent-A-Cat.
[307:52.74]Rent-A-Cat just gave 100 bucks.
[307:53.66]And just says Kappa 10,000.
[307:54.56]Rent-A-Cat.
[307:55.04]100 bucks.
[307:55.70]10,000 bits.
[307:55.90]This one's for you.
[307:57.08]That wasn't worth 100 dollars.
[307:59.04]Let me try again.
[308:20.05]Fred the Cat, thank you so much, man.
[308:22.57]Thank you for the 100 fucking dollars.
[308:25.59]You fucking absolute legend.
[308:27.59]It's just... There's no way I could possibly, Bruce, tell you how grateful I am.
[308:35.86]And now this is just turning into Grandpa.
[308:37.88]This is just me doing Michael Caine as Grandpa now, apparently.
[308:44.06]Thank you so much, man.
[308:45.90]We're gonna do this.
[308:46.34]I don't know what it is.
[308:49.29]I'm like, I got a second wind so big here.
[308:51.23]Refund.
[308:51.73]Don't refund.
[308:52.79]Don't refund.
[308:53.69]No refunds.
[308:59.40]This is fun.
[309:03.76]So who am I saving?
[309:04.60]That guy's terrifying.
[309:11.43]How many drinks have I had?
[309:12.23]Zero.
[309:12.61]I'm drinking, like, some random coffee.
[309:14.29]Moral of the story, Reaper, thanks for the... Hold on, wait a minute.
[309:19.83]So who should I defeat here?
[309:21.07]Oh boy.
[309:40.65]There was no speaking of Batman That was Batman I want that guy to live It's too late now at this point and What happened why did Sauron just exploded?
[309:50.31]Why did I just say what's going on with the eye of Sauron?
[310:06.94]What was going on there?
[310:11.75]I'm a little confused at what the fuck just happened.
[310:16.47]The Eye of Sauron just took over and killed that guy for me.
[310:19.31]Ow.
[310:35.05]Give up, Ranger.
[310:40.67]Don't fuck this up.
[310:44.59]Yeah, let's call in the Gondor support.
[310:47.47]Call in the Gondor support units.
[310:49.63]And my... I'm just a necromancer from Diablo II now.

[312:21.66]That is such an exploit.
[312:23.04]I'm sorry.

[312:32.53]My experience.
[312:33.97]My experience.

[313:06.05]One more bit.
[313:06.71]Again, death defying, sure.
[313:18.16]Oh, he's soft-headed.
[313:24.31]He's got a real soft skull, like a baby.
[313:26.03]Like he's an adult.
[313:30.29]And now he's dead.
[313:34.50]How can he see?
[313:35.04]He doesn't need to see.
[313:35.68]He's got all that experience.
[313:38.78]He doesn't need to be able to see.
[313:40.59]What is that?
[313:44.01]What?
[313:52.77]Get fucked.
[314:05.33]Yeah, like, honestly, like, you wanna talk about a gamer.

[314:43.67]Now rip their throats out.
[314:48.17]Why am I fighting this still?
[314:49.43]There's no reason for me to do this.
[314:53.61]Get me out of here.
[315:01.18]I want to do the freaking mission.
[315:15.07]I'm just locked in.
[315:15.67]I can't move.
[315:17.05]Thank God that guy came over here, because I wasn't going to be able to move.
[315:25.70]Alright.
[315:26.20]Time to run.
[315:26.84]Get away from me.
[315:27.62]Thank you very much.
[315:29.02]It's been real.
[315:32.05]Let me go pick up the shit that was over here.
[315:34.25]Move out of my way, please.
[315:36.69]There was one of these.
[315:38.35]I think there was a coin, too.
[315:42.09]There it is.
[315:49.46]Looks like next is back on the menu.
[315:51.36]No, it is not.
[315:54.51]I'm having lots of fun right now.
[315:55.95]Why would I next right?
[315:56.95]Where do I get a next two?
[316:04.71]Pick up the Star Wars coin.
[316:08.97]Two Star Wars coins.
[316:12.86]it's easy to dismiss the orcs as brutish but that demeanor masks a cunning and cruelty well suited for warfare time to play some roblox likewise seem brutish but make no mistake I'm not going to play a virus game this mace is far older than what we usually find on the battlefield I doubt the orc who stole it knew of its heritage
[316:42.44]Okay.
[316:43.32]Go to the mission start point.
[316:46.26]Sure.
[316:50.95]Grave, walk on!
[316:56.65]Trader's Gate.
[317:00.07]Is that the name of a video game?
[317:02.41]I'm just running straight into this.
[317:06.27]Not very stealthy.
[317:10.86]I'm trying to do the shoulder tackle.
[317:12.20]I can't seem to get it to work.
[317:18.05]My favorite part about this game is, honest to God, being able to run straight into a wall and you fly up like a Sonic the Hedgehog spring.
[317:28.80]It really does help a lot.
[317:30.86]Web of Fate.
[317:31.80]What is this?
[317:33.04]Rotate the memory fragments?
[317:34.22]Alright, well there's a photo that somebody took.
[317:36.88]Did they take pictures back in Mordor?
[317:56.81]That was a huge, awful, painful burp.
[317:59.63]Damn, that hurt.
[318:00.31]Run, run, run.
[318:15.58]Can't wait to get the cars.
[318:18.54]Oh, you're a big guy.
[318:20.06]Oh, you're a big guy, aren't you?
[318:24.94]Run, run, run.
[318:27.85]Let's do this one.
[318:30.97]Acid reflex?
[318:31.59]No, no, it wasn't like an acid pain.
[318:33.11]It was like a... This pushed out way too fast through your vocal cords and hurt you.
[318:39.56]Like... Ow!
[318:42.02]You know what I mean?
[318:48.72]Is the spider a villain or an ally?
[318:50.72]She's supposed to be a villain from my understanding of the story.
[318:53.62]I've come to see more.
[318:57.64]I know.
[319:00.72]If you can see Sauron's fate, tell us his weakness so we may defeat him.
[319:09.06]Okay.
[319:10.14]Your vision is limited.
[319:11.29]I would love nothing more than to see his torment.
[319:16.93]To see him beg before me.
[319:20.16]My gaze is fixed upon the fate of Middle Earth.
[319:24.10]Return what you've stolen from me, and I will bring Sauron to you in chains.
[319:31.74]He came to see more.
[319:32.84]Why would I do that, Ringmaker?
[319:36.09]You and Sauron are one.
[319:39.63]Is this what you seek?
[319:41.31]Fakiries and riddles?
[319:43.31]She is not our ally.
[319:46.24]Certainly not yours.
[319:47.42]Is Caelid Rimbaugh a bad guy?
[319:49.40]Come tell him.
[319:51.04]No, she's hypnotizing him.
[319:52.84]See through my eyes.
[319:57.68]It's a darkness, but it's something but a ride.
[320:06.31]Hypnotize, hypnotize, hypnotize into your eyes.
[320:15.97]Oh.
[320:18.49]Calibrembo was always a quasi-villain.
[320:24.13]Quasi.
[320:24.43]Yeah, I know.
[320:25.81]Bewitched.
[320:26.09]Hey, Moo means Moo, thanks for the five bucks.
[320:42.41]Because some orc aren't looking for anything logical like money.
[320:44.93]They can't be bought, bullied, raised, or negotiated with.
[320:49.89]Some men just want to wash their legs.
[320:52.14]Take us to him.
[321:06.50]uh thanks thanks move for the five bucks ah my tummy my tummy keep the spider nest to summon she loves brood you summon spiders cool okay they're gonna

[321:40.83]Or should I just start, like, washing them?
[321:45.96]What a cool feature.
[321:48.62]Oh, wait a minute.
[321:49.02]Hold on.
[321:54.16]Here they come.
[321:54.56]Here they go.
[321:56.20]Here they go!
[321:56.62]Holy shit, it's like a facehugger.
[322:11.16]Well, one guy got away.
[322:29.68]What?
[322:30.62]Hey!
[322:31.00]Hey!
[322:31.38]Wait!
[322:32.45]It's okay.
[322:35.65]We're good.
[322:37.51]Follow Gollum.
[322:42.44]Shoot the ghoul eggs to attract ghouls.
[322:47.20]Wait, no, I want... I need to do my League of Legends move.
[322:59.03]See, that, like, stuns everybody around, and then I do 20% more damage with my 1.
[323:04.70]And that's like the initiate move.
[323:05.88]And then like fucking... And then... Uh... Caitlyn, whatever her name is, comes over and does like the spear throw.
[323:12.48]Who's the magical guy?
[323:13.98]Forsaken Memory.
[323:14.72]He comes... He throws his cards like Gambit.
[323:17.64]It's just Gambit.
[323:18.36]They just renamed him Forsaken Memory.
[323:22.95]And then Amumu comes over and... Look at how cute he is!
[323:26.37]Right?
[323:27.75]I just explained the whole game to you.
[323:29.33]Every game of League of Legends.
[323:36.33]Whoa, wait a minute.
[323:42.94]I don't exist.
[323:46.42]Fuck.
[323:47.06]I was like talking and wasn't paying attention.
[323:51.61]He's raising the alarm.
[323:52.43]Fuck!
[323:59.33]No!
[324:01.31]There he goes.
[324:01.81]Don't!
[324:08.74]No!
[324:11.62]Did I get it?
[324:20.51]I did it.
[324:24.93]I lost because I was too far away from the mission.
[324:26.69]Did you see that?
[324:28.15]It wasn't even because he did that.
[324:30.11]I just got too far away from the mission area.
[324:34.62]God damn it.
[324:49.05]Summon!
[324:50.53]I can't get over that.
[324:51.15]That was perfect.
[324:56.61]Don't sound the alarm.
[324:59.65]Follow this guy.
[325:00.53]Whoops.
[325:01.25]Avoid detection.
[325:02.85]No, this ain't going to work.
[325:06.29]Sorry.
[325:06.67]That wasn't going to happen.
[325:08.79]It just wasn't.
[325:39.23]I wish I didn't have to do that, but I kind of had to.
[325:50.92]Ah!
[325:53.79]Ah!
[325:57.03]Fucking hell!
[325:57.77]No!
[325:59.45]No!
[326:01.53]I hit the double jump way too quick.
[326:16.10]Alright, there's no alarm.
[326:18.60]Good.
[326:23.32]Where is he?
[326:27.30]Where is he going?
[326:28.22]Where is he?
[326:28.57]Where's the guy that's running?
[326:29.51]Where is he?
[326:29.89]I don't see him.
[326:34.05]Holy crap.
[326:46.89]Wow!

[329:18.85]Are they just stuck up there?
[329:26.60]How did they light a fire?
[329:28.82]There's no way that you could have lit on fire.
[329:34.40]There's no fire up there.

[330:22.15]I'm being cheered on.
[330:22.97]That helps.
[330:26.01]Do I have any intel on this guy?
[330:27.19]I don't think I do.
[330:32.52]You're kind of a wuss for being a warchief.
[330:36.80]You're not that great.
[330:47.63]Well, I say that, and then I'm gonna, like, lose.
[330:50.11]Look, alright, you two, you idiots up there, dismiss them.
[330:54.25]I can't dismiss them.
[330:55.43]Dismiss.
[331:04.65]I think that enraged him.
[331:07.46]Wait.
[331:08.02]Get him.

[332:03.52]Okay.
[332:13.77]Doesn't that happen in a movie?
[332:17.83]This is the work of the Witch King.
[332:19.03]What movie?
[332:19.53]He told us.
[332:21.56]We must get my ring back.
[332:24.56]And we will.
[332:25.88]But first we have to deal with the traitor.
[332:27.84]Traitor.
[332:28.52]It's gonna be Barmon.
[332:32.42]I thought that just said he has issues.
[332:34.36]I thought they were going for like a zinger right there.
[332:37.96]He has issues.
[333:04.19]Alright, cool.
[333:06.19]So... Slow down.
[333:08.35]Hi, guys.
[333:08.67]You did a lot of work.
[333:29.13]that guy dragon excuse me dragon yeah I'll take a dragon for five dollars please I'll take dragons for 200 uh Alex
[334:01.14]I can't wait to have this for the rest of the game.
[334:03.78]I don't even care about the guy escaping.
[334:05.20]I want the dragon.
[334:09.01]He's just like shoot- oh shit, they're shooting him too.
[334:11.17]Is he on the ground?
[334:13.05]He's on the ground.
[334:13.47]Alright, get him!
[334:16.89]Whoa!
[334:26.18]Get it.
[334:27.83]Come on, get it.
[334:31.15]Break him.
[334:31.69]No, don't let him get away.
[334:34.51]No, no, no.
[334:35.05]There it is.
[334:35.45]No.
[334:35.53]No.
[334:35.69]Oh, please turn back around.
[335:00.04]Okay, here we go.
[335:10.37]Got it!
[335:11.29]Okay.
[335:12.75]Hold R-T to breathe fire and gain might.
[335:15.64]Press A to flap wings for a speed boost.
[335:17.62]Precise timing grants higher maximum speed.
[335:20.08]Hold X to dive and grab enemies.
[335:24.47]LT to aim with greater precision.
[335:26.63]While aiming, hold Y to strafe up or B to strafe down.
[335:28.93]When you might, this foe will press RB while aiming to spit a fireball.
[335:34.45]Oh, this is awesome.
[335:41.89]Okay, well, I just found the best part of the whole game.
[335:46.91]Grab enemy.
[335:47.59]What enemy?
[335:49.90]Eat enemies for health?
[335:52.07]Where's there an... I'm just grabbing him like a fucking bird?
[335:56.31]How do I eat him?
[335:58.77]How do I eat this guy?
[335:59.75]He's weighing me down.
[336:01.75]What do I eat?
[336:03.53]Oh my god, I ripped his head off.
[336:06.83]Holy shit.
[336:08.81]Where's the guy in the red?
[336:11.06]I'm just picking up mice and eating them.
[336:17.40]This is so cool.
[336:18.14]I love it.
[336:19.99]Can I pick up a... Let's go back to the mission.
[336:25.06]I'm taking him out of here.
[336:32.68]This is so funny.
[336:33.68]How about you?
[336:38.97]Scoop this guy up.
[336:41.13]Oh, you can just drop him too.
[336:43.05]That's cool.
[336:45.77]What about this guy?
[336:48.95]I can actually... You can carry these guys?
[336:54.02]That's a strong dragon.
[336:55.38]Let's go bowling.
[337:01.71]I'm taking him with me.
[337:04.85]Let's get out of here.
[337:08.67]Can you pick up Grogs?
[337:10.36]What if I drop him right here?
[337:17.65]I have to go as high as I can.
[337:22.92]You can go pretty high.
[337:27.54]I can eat him too.
[337:31.25]It's my pet troll now.
[337:33.77]I want to see where I need to go.
[337:35.19]Where's like the next mission?
[337:37.45]This guy's going to explode if I drop him.
[337:41.27]Eat?
[337:41.43]No, I want to drop him.
[337:43.00]I want to go as high as I can and just watch him.
[337:48.67]This guy's gonna have to be, it's gonna be a long way down for him.
[337:54.79]Yeah, I think I'm up as high as I can be.
[337:58.35]Not really.
[337:58.85]Wait, did I let go?
[337:59.51]Wait, where'd he go?
[338:02.85]Wait, where'd he go?
[338:03.35]Where'd he go?
[338:03.69]Where'd he go?
[338:04.23]What?
[338:04.83]What happened?
[338:05.28]I don't have anybody.
[338:07.78]He's not in my hands anymore.
[338:10.14]Why does it say release drop?
[338:12.06]I don't have him.
[338:15.54]What the fuck is going on?
[338:19.74]Eat him!
[338:22.60]There's nobody to eat.
[338:29.14]What the fuck, man?
[338:32.53]It just still thinks I have him in my arms.
[338:37.07]What happens if I try to land?
[338:41.03]Fucking hell.
[338:41.93]That sucks.
[338:47.52]Alright, maybe if I take him out of the area.
[338:52.12]Let's go out of the area.
[338:55.06]My dragon is all fucked up now.
[338:56.46]That's great.
[338:57.02]Okay, um... Where to now?
[339:07.17]The arena.
[339:11.05]So where is the arena?
[339:18.19]Is it in the other... Like, where the hell is it?
[339:25.45]Is it the place I'm standing in right now?
[339:26.91]This is annoying.
[339:29.79]I'm just gonna try to land.
[339:40.54]Just get me down here.
[339:44.06]I don't have any elf shot, apparently, so I can't eat.
[339:49.13]Okay.
[339:51.13]That's not going so well.
[339:54.30]The game does not want me to do... I can't leave.
[339:56.44]I can't go forward.
[339:59.86]I don't even know what I'm... What's even hitting me?
[340:05.70]Alright, what if I...
[340:21.24]Alright, come here.
[340:22.44]Let me get back on him.
[340:23.46]No, you dickhead.
[340:33.46]I want to get back on top of him.
[340:41.22]I have my own personal artillery.
[340:43.80]I mean, that's kind of cool.
[340:46.62]No, don't go away.
[340:49.57]I can't, like, mount him because I don't have enough elf shooter.
[340:56.19]Gotta wait till he flies by again.
[341:01.53]In fact, this may be a decent place to stop.
[341:08.95]Right here, come on.
[341:11.17]Really?
[341:11.57]No, that sucks.
[341:13.98]Whatever, let's just go.
[341:19.91]I'm very upset about this.
[341:25.61]Yeah, we've gone for like five and a half, six hours now, right?
[341:27.91]I think it's time for a break.
[341:34.80]Okay, well, I just got bit by a spider.
[341:40.00]That seems wonderful.
[341:45.34]Yeah, I'll take a stop here.
[341:48.41]I'm sad that I couldn't do anything with the dragon, because it broke.
[341:53.86]Because he's now all the way on the other side.
[341:55.16]If you just ate him, this wouldn't be an issue.
[342:00.35]Well, I wanted to drop him from, like, an extremely high height.
[342:03.95]And just see what happened.
[342:06.73]Uh, let's do this.
[342:08.63]Get some more health for the Karagor.
[342:21.09]Alright.
[342:24.23]That's gonna be it.
[342:27.09]Need elf shot.
[342:33.34]Alright, guys.
[342:35.38]I need to get some food in me.
[342:36.94]I'm gonna take my break.
[342:39.88]And we may play this again.
[342:43.90]Here's the thing.
[342:47.36]The Evil Within 2 comes out on Friday.
[342:49.93]So maybe I'll play this again on Thursday for like another five or six hours.
[342:54.23]See what we can do.
[342:54.82]Ugh, another painful burp, ow.
[343:00.18]Maybe not this for another six hours on Thursday and then The Evil Within 2 is Friday and obviously we're just gonna have to be, gonna have to play that, you know.
[343:10.20]Looks like food's back on the menu.
[343:13.80]How about tomorrow?
[343:14.66]I cannot stream tomorrow.
[343:16.98]I have to go see a new baby.
[343:19.44]So, that should be interesting.
[343:24.49]So, let's wrap this up.
[343:28.85]And I will see you guys on Thursday.
[343:31.37]Thanks for sticking around.
[343:32.21]Longer stream tonight.
[343:33.62]More than just about six hours.
[343:36.56]Not the typical three to four hour fair.
[343:38.66]But I do.
[343:39.56]I'm having fun playing the game, so.
[343:42.15]Anyways, thank you, StixRenegade, for the five bucks.
[343:43.91]Finally, I can go to bed.
[343:47.61]Well, I'm sorry that I kept you up.
[343:50.93]Sorry that you stayed up because of me.
[343:54.15]We're not going to go too much longer.
[343:55.07]I don't want to go to, like, one o'clock in the morning.
[343:58.67]Maybe Thursday we'll go for a little longer.
[344:00.20]Uh, no, not Uncle Jeremy.
[344:03.70]This is a friend.
[344:04.40]This is a friend of mine who had a baby.
[344:10.17]Thank you, Stix.
[344:11.65]Five bucks.
[344:12.31]Uh, Lee LeFurl, thank you for the two bucks.
[344:17.01]I am a Dothraki.
[344:18.91]Oh, God.
[344:20.97]I'm not a Dothraki.
[344:22.79]Thank you for the two bucks.
[344:25.90]Uh, Rent-A-Cat, obviously, thank you for the hundred dollars.
[344:30.22]That was obviously 40 minutes ago or so now, but you are very, very grateful.
[344:36.44]You're a very, very grateful man.
[344:39.88]You're very charitable.
[344:41.08]You're very great.
[344:41.92]You're grateful.
[344:42.50]You're full of greatness.
[344:44.64]As is anybody else.
[344:47.16]That watches the stream.
[344:49.94]Is it Burger Boy?
[344:50.56]Yes, it is.
[344:50.98]It's his second baby.
[344:52.34]Isn't that fucking insane?
[344:55.74]You're full of milk.
[344:57.07]You're full of greatness.
[344:58.05]All you guys have greatness in you.
[345:01.21]Greatness awaits.
[345:06.05]Yeah.
[345:06.39]Burger Boy has two children.
[345:13.06]I couldn't, I can't even believe it.
[345:17.36]But Reaper, thanks for the five bucks.
[345:19.44]Moral of the story, every George on the planet is the same person.
[345:22.85]It's probably true.
[345:26.07]Granny Bacon, thanks for the five bucks.
[345:27.29]Hey, turn on your face cam and say something funny.
[345:45.03]That's like fucking Farquaad hair.
[345:47.77]There's your funny joke.
[345:49.37]Look at this hair.
[345:49.93]I don't need to say anything.
[345:52.47]I look like a fucking murderer.
[346:00.28]But thank you for the $5.
[346:06.10]And I think that's caught up.
[346:10.36]Make you zen this gaming for the $1.
[346:11.82]You should vlog at TwitchCon.
[346:13.14]Also kill Ogg.
[346:15.28]Maybe.
[346:17.50]Am I growing my hair so much?
[346:18.48]I'm just kind of lazy.
[346:19.32]It's fun to see how long I can grow it out before I lose all my hair.
[346:25.42]Who knows?
[346:28.00]But... Thank you so much for watching, everybody.
[346:33.16]I am extraordinarily grateful for the Grateful Dead and their first album.
[346:39.69]Wand flew over the cuckoo's nest.
[346:42.05]And all of you, see you on Thursday.
[346:45.17]Much love.
[346:46.60]Have a good rest of your night.
[346:47.40]Get some sleep.
[346:49.00]Take care, everybody.
[346:49.66]See you soon.
[347:19.52]No, no secret joke.
[347:21.86]There is no secret joke incoming.
[347:23.46]I just want to make that very clear.
[347:26.27]Ow.
[347:28.09]Goodnight.
[348:17.32]Turn flesh over there!
