[00:01.44]pie well how do you do more gold your majesty hey that's exactly the game we're playing tonight welcome everybody hope you've had a swell few days I've had an interesting few days it's been very very fun very very interesting stuff going on
[00:31.63]What happened to GTA?
[00:33.93]I want to play GTA online with people.
[00:36.91]Like others, like do like a streamer, a streamer night.
[00:40.32]I'm trying to find people that would want to do it.
[00:41.76]Because I think it's fun when you bring in like four, like three to four GTA friends to do it together.
[00:55.11]So I want to, I want to do it with people.
[01:00.02]30 to 50 GTA friends.
[01:06.32]But anyways, this is a requested game.
[01:10.84]And it's a game that I got very interested in.
[01:14.31]Because it's a game.
[01:14.93]It's called Majesty.
[01:16.13]It's an old one.
[01:17.99]And in this game, it's kind of in the RTS strategy game style.
[01:23.37]But there's one, one, one very large difference.
[01:26.47]In this game, you do not have any control over anyone in the game.
[01:31.61]You build your castle, your kingdom, and you don't get to determine what the fuck happens.
[01:43.36]Is it an anime?
[01:46.30]No.
[01:49.06]No.
[01:51.33]It's not.
[01:54.50]But thank you, Lunchmeat, for the five community subs right off the bat.
[01:57.50]Thanks, Lunchmeat.
[01:59.70]And then PhylacteryLich gave 50 bucks.
[02:03.50]Both you guys.
[02:05.52]I haven't even done anything.
[02:07.02]And look at this.
[02:07.94]It's already here.
[02:09.74]A shitload of money.
[02:10.46]Thank you for the 50 dollars, PhylacteryLich.
[02:12.18]Don't you ever leave us again, Jeremy.
[02:13.64]We need you.
[02:15.58]You don't need me.
[02:19.03]It's been inside of you the whole time.
[02:21.43]You don't need me.
[02:22.59]It's a Star Wars thing, right?
[02:26.06]Who said that?
[02:26.54]Yoda?
[02:33.00]I'm the only Majesty streamer in the history of Twitch.
[02:35.89]I don't believe that at all.
[02:38.57]But let me just make a tweet and we'll get started.
[02:40.79]Give me one sec.
[03:17.79]Okay.
[03:19.01]Alright, so this is the HD version.
[03:21.51]Hopefully there's nothing I need to do for this version.
[03:24.13]I don't think there is.
[03:24.73]The thing that I have a problem with in these old games, when they do an HD remaster, they usually just make you hold the binoculars the other way around and look at the game.
[03:44.89]It ends up being in this tiny little square
[03:50.09]And everything's so small.
[03:51.51]It's like looking at the back of a cereal box.
[03:53.17]Do you guys know what I'm talking about when I say that?
[03:55.83]You know when there's a game on the back of a cereal box?
[03:59.27]It's an elaborate bunch of shit that they stuff on there.
[04:01.95]And it's so small, but they had to put as much on there as possible.
[04:07.62]That's how I feel when they remaster old games.
[04:11.64]We'll see if it's the case.
[04:17.22]There it is.
[04:19.58]uh let's get the audio on it's got a nice little uh little jingle what's my favorite what's my favorite egg flavor and there look there you go here's your cereal box this is the back of the fruit loops box no it's not that's not gonna be it this is gonna be bigger it's gonna blow up a little
[04:47.71]That's my favorite egg flavor.
[04:48.95]Yeah, yeah, egg.
[04:49.83]What are you talking about?
[04:51.21]Alright, play game.
[04:55.49]Please enter your name.
[04:56.51]Your majesty.
[04:58.07]Um, you're gonna have something interesting, right?
[05:01.41]Am I king yet?
[05:03.17]Well, the crown implies yes.
[05:04.99]Uh, how about... No, not Jax.
[05:12.32]Not every character has to be Jax.
[05:15.46]How about, um...
[05:21.50]I mean, like, that's the person that just gave five community subs.
[05:23.82]We're gonna have to thank him.
[05:24.58]Thank you, King Ryan Goodstream.
[05:28.40]Thanks for the five subs.
[05:38.43]I'm gonna see this for the remainder of this whole game, so we're gonna have to... That's like an old name.
[05:45.11]No, I don't want to do one of those old jokey names.
[05:46.83]Like, oh, Barnabas or Cornelius.
[05:48.75]No, no, no, no, no.
[05:49.57]It's something easy.
[05:52.50]Is I a king of Bottleby?
[05:54.83]No.
[06:06.41]I don't wanna write, like, an actual senator's name here.
[06:09.74]Uh... King Senator.
[06:18.58]King Senator Jeremy.
[06:21.51]I kinda like that.

[06:59.73]I forget the name already, but what happened is my voice got pitched up as I was going through that.
[07:04.03]I forgot his name already.
[07:05.47]Play the epic quest The Bell, The Book, and The Candle to get an introduction to the game.
[07:11.93]There's three different actors.
[07:14.55]Okay, The Bell, The Book, and The Candle.
[07:17.07]And they are doing fucking cereal box bullshit.

[07:26.57]And take a look at the back.
[07:27.47]They have like... Oh, over here is like the fun dome of interaction.
[07:30.94]There's like two word games over here.
[07:36.56]Oh, can you find the four Toucan Sams?
[07:41.20]I've seen this before.
[07:42.96]This is a secret quest.
[07:47.99]What was it?
[07:48.47]The bell, the book...
[07:52.23]Where the fuck is it?
[07:54.03]Okay, am I stupid?
[07:55.57]This is its own game.
[07:58.01]The bell, the book, and the... This one?
[08:03.09]Find all the hidden objects.
[08:04.92]It's a spider.
[08:05.72]A spider down here?
[08:07.06]I found a tree.
[08:17.46]The Forsaken Land.
[08:18.34]The Barren Waste.
[08:19.80]Quest for the Crown.
[08:21.90]Rescue the prince.
[08:24.98]The bell, the book.
[08:27.40]Where the fuck is this?
[08:36.23]This is huge.
[08:37.87]That was it?
[08:40.51]Quest for the crown, the forsaken land, the barren waste, secret quest.
[08:45.99]Is this the quest for the crown, quest for the chalice?
[08:49.42]Is it this one?
[08:52.34]You just read it.
[08:52.96]No, no, no.
[08:53.26]I said what I was looking for.
[08:58.00]The bell, the book, and the candle.
[09:10.52]Okay, there it is.
[09:13.95]Forgive the intrusion, Highness, but we've been robbed.
[09:16.75]Someone has stolen the magic bell, the holy book, and the eternal candle.
[09:21.34]Right from under our noses, they were whisked away from the royal treasury by some scoundrel.
[09:25.96]We must do something to recover them.
[09:27.84]They are treasures beyond value.
[09:29.88]Okay.
[09:31.18]Well, we've been robbed.
[09:33.29]Somebody stole the book, somebody stole the bell, somebody stole the candle.
[09:37.31]Let's go.
[09:39.78]Goals.
[09:40.10]Recover the three items which have been stolen from your palace and hidden in the lairs throughout this realm.
[09:44.84]No warriors or wizards available in this quest.
[09:52.14]Okay.
[09:57.01]Remember, I can't control anybody.
[09:59.89]What the hell am I supposed to do?
[10:01.59]Alright, so.
[10:02.69]Here's our...
[10:04.85]City Guard 1.
[10:06.53]Statistic buildings.
[10:08.33]Blacksmith Gnome Hubble.
[10:13.13]Where's the vehicle depot?
[10:17.73]Wait, what?
[10:18.78]What's going on?
[10:19.70]Is it a spider?
[10:27.24]Okay, there are rumors that thieves who stole the artifact from your treasury have fled, but were forced to hide the artifacts as they left.
[10:35.15]Find the items before the thieves have a chance to return.
[10:37.41]Okay.
[10:41.17]Find the artifacts before the thieves have a chance to return.
[10:44.57]What's going on over here?
[10:45.61]Guardhouse?
[10:51.04]Heroes.
[10:51.56]Okay, so... Blacksmith Rogues Guild?
[10:53.64]Uh... Didn't it say that it was going to teach me how to play the game?
[11:19.57]Am I, like, mistaken, or was that like, hey, click on this one if you want to learn?
[11:22.39]There we go, alright.
[11:24.33]Heroes visit the blacksmith in order to purchase better weapons and armor.
[11:27.87]Once you have researched those skills, upgrade your blacksmith and even better items will be available for you to research.
[11:34.29]Okay.
[11:34.83]Heroes visit the blacksmith to purchase better weapons.
[11:36.63]So... Once you have researched those skills... Okay.
[11:42.24]So where do I research those skills?
[11:44.76]Level 1.
[11:45.14]Oh, here we go.
[11:47.14]Guardhouse.
[11:48.66]I'm reading.
[12:01.26]You just, like, dragged Ebenezer Scrooge out of bed before he was Ebenezer Scrooge.
[12:05.77]I'm just thinking of a guy with a fucking hat on, with the thing on the top.
[12:09.49]And you just put me in a slot as a king.
[12:11.87]And I'm like, you know what, fuck that whole reference.
[12:14.39]Uh, can fire arrows at nearby enemies once you research that skill.
[12:18.07]Use them to protect vital buildings or far-flung outposts from your city.
[12:21.11]Henchmen also rest at guardhouses if they are closer than the palace.
[12:24.27]Okay.
[12:25.63]What are we doing with these things?
[12:29.74]You'll get it next time.
[12:30.64]Yeah, I was, like, gonna go somewhere with that.
[12:32.96]Okay, so guardhouses can fire arrows at enemies.
[12:37.48]Sounds good.
[12:38.14]You need to... You want better stuff.
[12:39.88]Why are there just random people coming over here?
[12:43.81]And why is the city guard walking around?
[12:46.11]Is there... Is this, like, another NPC?
[12:48.77]Is this, like, a person controlling this?
[12:50.15]Or are they just wandering around?
[12:52.59]Alright, where's the next note?
[12:57.55]If our kingdom is to prosper, it needs more heroes.
[13:00.97]I know.
[13:02.35]Inns are gathering and resting places for heroes and allow them to extend their range of their wandering.
[13:10.42]If you build them outside your main city.
[13:12.20]Okay, so.
[13:14.12]You want to have inns further out.
[13:17.90]It's a way for you to continue to have heroes kind of come in and say hello and say what's up.
[13:23.88]I have no idea what that means.
[13:24.94]I know that means something.
[13:26.61]Okay.
[13:26.73]Okay.
[13:29.45]120 HP.
[13:30.27]Coffers hold 57 gold.
[13:34.11]Oh, tax collector.
[13:37.63]Henchmen.
[13:38.09]Minimum return.
[13:40.70]Decrease this tax collector's minimum return amount.
[13:42.96]Maximum pickup.
[13:46.14]So this guy just walks around and collects taxes.
[13:47.94]Okay, cool.
[13:49.20]What's down?
[13:49.56]What the hell is this?
[13:52.92]Trading posts are a place for heroes to purchase healing potions.
[13:57.76]Healing potions.
[14:05.64]I know.
[14:06.87]I'm gonna try.
[14:07.55]I need to... Hold on.
[14:09.99]Trading posts are a place for heroes to purchase healing potions, build a marketplace near your palace, and the trading post will periodically send out caravans to them.
[14:17.81]Okay.
[14:18.61]So if you have a marketplace near your palace, you can get caravans.
[14:22.92]Bring in a bunch of gold to your treasury.
[14:26.31]Forget about the random snake ladies that run around.
[14:29.25]That's just a problem.
[14:30.19]They're like bugs.
[14:31.66]Watch out for them.
[14:34.84]Okay.
[14:37.98]We need more heroes.
[14:38.94]I'm working on it!
[14:43.42]I'm waiting for the next thing to pop up.
[14:44.68]Alright, what do we got?
[14:46.52]Cast Farseeing.
[14:48.09]There's no wizards allowed here, right?
[14:49.35]Palace.
[14:51.75]Who builds shit?
[14:52.85]Oh, I do.
[14:53.95]Okay, buildings.
[14:55.54]Guardhouse in Marketplace, right?
[14:58.55]Do we have one of those already?
[15:00.85]Build a marketplace.
[15:06.53]Who builds the marketplace?
[15:08.65]Do the guards build the marketplace?
[15:12.62]Peasants at work on site.
[15:16.88]How long does this take?
[15:20.74]Oh, I only have one peasant?
[15:23.49]No, we need way more than that.
[15:24.73]Roster.
[15:28.15]Buildings.
[15:28.93]Henchmen.
[15:29.40]City guard.
[15:30.06]How do I get more peasants?
[15:30.88]I only have like five people in my whole town.
[15:38.74]What?
[15:38.94]Somebody just like crashed.
[15:45.62]Who just crashed?
[15:51.79]Okay.
[15:52.07]Got my marketplace.
[15:54.67]So then that means that I can...
[16:03.23]Your Highness, if our kingdom is to prosper, it needs more heroes.
[16:09.72]Okay, how do I prevent this from happening?
[16:13.08]Oh, the tax collector!
[16:14.10]Yeah, throw the bag of money!
[16:15.16]Uh... How do you turn around?
[16:21.14]Tax collector...
[16:31.68]Okay.
[16:32.56]Cool.
[16:32.84]Uh, uh.
[16:35.02]Something, something, something, your highness.
[16:36.40]Something, something.
[16:37.10]I need a hero.
[16:38.58]Recruit a rogue?
[16:46.54]Why do they just stand around over here?
[16:50.48]Don't I have... Oh, tax collector.
[16:56.29]It's me.
[16:57.35]Roger from American Dad.
[17:12.33]Is this the zombie following?
[17:13.65]Alright, so now we can make money.
[17:16.90]Do I not get to determine who gets made?
[17:19.94]In Ranger's Guild, Rogue's Guild, Trading Post.
[17:23.88]Scott the Snitch.
[17:27.06]Scott the Snitch is stealing.
[17:31.08]Who the fuck is this?
[17:35.20]Kill him!
[17:39.15]Get him!
[17:42.75]He's just taking money from every building.
[18:09.32]This city sucks.
[18:11.18]Alright, where's my rogue?
[18:14.00]Don't I have a rogue?
[18:20.09]Ah, there we go.
[18:20.59]I can actually drag this around.
[18:21.59]Alright, get this off.
[18:22.35]I don't know why this is even here.
[18:24.05]Oh, there's the rogue.
[18:26.11]Scott snitches!
[18:26.85]Hold on, is Scott the snitch killing things but helping me?
[18:33.97]Is Scott the snitch the rogue that I just hired?
[18:43.48]What?
[18:46.56]Hold on a second.
[18:49.96]I just hired the guy, and he just went off to start stealing shit.
[18:55.96]Okay.
[18:56.98]We need police.
[18:58.84]No, sorry, the police are currently dealing with Medusas.
[19:01.05]I need a hero.
[19:03.09]I need another one of those things to tell me what building I need to make.
[19:07.92]Guardhouse?
[19:08.66]No, I don't have any heroes.
[19:10.42]Blacksmith?
[19:11.22]Research.
[19:11.64]Let's see.
[19:12.90]Level, uh, two weapons.
[19:15.06]I got plenty of money.
[19:23.67]Ranger's Guild.
[19:25.03]Rogue's Guild.
[19:25.69]Alright, I'm gonna build, like, a Ranger's Guild over here.
[19:29.53]Yes.
[19:29.81]I just did that.
[19:41.99]How do I get that off?
[19:44.46]So, are you a hero?
[19:49.70]Peasant 1.
[19:51.40]Scott the snitch, yeah.
[19:56.29]This dickhead is the one that... Okay, so how do I tell him to go... Oh, we need more, we need more.
[20:01.17]Let's get some more.
[20:06.48]There's a peasant right there.
[20:07.38]Let's build another ranger's guild.
[20:08.92]Okay.
[20:13.75]This is Mr. Tightgold.
[20:16.67]I'm out of here.
[20:17.23]Kill this thing.
[20:21.66]Did he just win it?
[20:22.94]There are monsters attacking the kingdom right now.
[20:25.62]Killing peasants.
[20:26.90]There we go.
[20:27.56]Nice job.
[20:28.16]Dave the Screamer.
[20:29.28]Alright, I like Dave the Screamer.
[20:30.58]Your majesty, a new building is complete.
[20:34.58]Spells, stats.
[20:35.54]Alright.
[20:38.76]Alright, there's the ranger's guild.
[20:42.79]Prefer a ranger.
[20:43.83]Let's get a ranger in here.
[20:46.37]Um, how do I get them to do anything?
[20:47.99]Like, go explore!
[20:49.21]I guess I have to build the buildings and see what happens.
[21:04.87]I don't even know what that means.
[21:07.25]Use the flags.
[21:16.03]Use the lid.
[21:16.75]I'm out of here.
[21:22.56]This is supposed to be the tutorial, and all they've said was, Welcome!
[21:25.36]You need a hero!
[21:28.32]What the hell are you... Okay, good.
[21:29.24]Get up there.
[21:29.70]I take the path less traveled.
[21:34.75]Here's a range.
[21:35.51]Let's do what we got.
[21:38.43]It's you up there.
[21:39.09]So I can keep them in little windows here.
[21:42.09]Let's get another one.
[21:50.43]If you double-click monsters, you get a bounty flag, okay?
[21:53.22]Alright, Scott the Snitch is doing a pretty good job over here.
[22:00.10]Is it attacking the caravan?
[22:10.35]Finally, I killed something.
[22:16.04]Kill it!
[22:18.68]Thank you, $350.
[22:19.42]All right, deposit that.
[22:25.68]Are you exploring over here?
[22:27.42]Oh, you're doing a good job.
[22:29.76]Kill it!
[22:32.80]Nice.
[22:33.87]I feel like I'm just looking at a top-down view of World of Warcraft.
[22:38.87]I'm just looking at Goldshire right now from a top-down view.
[22:42.11]That's my fourth tax collector.
[22:51.91]How much bigger is this map to not find this stuff?
[22:59.26]Visitors, who's even there?
[23:00.22]Okay.
[23:01.56]Seeking refuge at the inn.
[23:03.10]Okay.
[23:13.57]Alright, so Scott the Snitch.
[23:15.32]No, I don't even know what the fuck I just did.
[23:17.82]I need, like, the game manual in my lap right now.
[23:21.70]Sewer entrance.
[23:30.03]Okay.
[23:31.13]Let me take a look at what this stuff even is.
[23:32.47]I don't even know.
[23:40.12]Trading Posts.
[23:40.90]So, let me research something here.
[23:43.27]Healing Potions.
[23:44.05]They need those.
[23:46.67]We're getting overwhelmed.
[23:48.61]I need more heroes.
[23:50.15]Nobody's here.
[23:50.73]Cool.
[23:51.41]Thank you, Jeeves.
[23:54.09]Whatever your name is.
[23:55.43]Alright, Recruit a Rogue.
[24:09.93]Who's in there?
[24:11.79]Two peasants are in the guardhouse right now.
[24:13.10]Alright, I need to find the book, the rabbit, and the candle.
[24:19.70]Whatever the hell it is.
[24:24.52]I wish I understood what was going on here.
[24:26.42]Like, I'm following him.
[24:28.26]What if I double-click on you?
[24:31.53]I can, like, follow two people at the same time.
[24:34.01]Let me see if I'm right.
[24:36.13]And then they have different things.
[24:37.15]Scan through buildings, scan through henchmen.
[24:40.32]Scan for heroes.
[24:42.22]Okay, here we go.
[24:47.24]Scott the Snitch.
[24:47.94]Okay, I'm gonna keep my spy camera on.
[24:52.10]Paul the Explorer and Scott the Snitch.
[24:58.07]You need warriors?
[24:59.11]Warriors were not allowed in this mission, I believe.
[25:03.21]What?
[25:11.25]This is a rat man?
[25:13.77]What?
[25:21.73]This is the tutorial?
[25:22.61]Yeah, and it's not tutorialing me anything!
[25:25.04]I got three notes left, sticky notes.
[25:29.96]I haven't been tutorialized at all.
[25:47.02]Reward attack flag?
[25:48.84]This guy's killing everybody!
[25:49.96]Heroes are often motivated by rewards offered by the sovereign.
[25:58.14]Oh, what the fuck?
[25:59.08]It's just $1,000 to kill this guy!
[26:00.24]Kill 10,000!
[26:00.54]Somebody will kill him!
[26:01.82]Yeah, you don't have to worry about that.
[26:19.30]my god all right so where is this I'm okay I got that concept now you gotta double click on somebody and offer an amount of money to kill it okay uh offered by senator jeremy 100 bucks what did that mean offer okay so if you go over here it's money okay I get would have loved to have known that like 10 minutes ago you got to give people incentives to explore okay
[26:49.16]So, uh... I want you to go over here.
[26:53.24]If you go up here, that's worth $300.
[26:55.04]No, that's worth $500, whoever wants to explore up there.
[27:03.76]Alright, so who the fuck's going up there?
[27:15.47]Who's going to take that bomb?
[27:16.39]All you have to do is walk over here.
[27:20.09]Are you gonna take that bounty?
[27:24.57]That's easy money.
[27:26.47]I don't blame you.
[27:36.90]Okay, research these, uh, how do I get this?
[27:38.70]Research level 2 weapons for sale.
[27:40.80]I can't do that.
[27:44.40]Uh, what else can I build?
[27:45.08]What's a gnome hubbub?
[27:53.89]I'm looking for three items.
[27:54.99]Let's go down.
[27:56.07]Look, somebody needs to... No one's going to claim this for some reason.
[28:00.55]Oh, it's Marketplace Rangers Guild.
[28:06.76]Groot, another ranger.
[28:07.80]Let's get, like, five of these guys.
[28:11.58]You going up there?
[28:13.06]Oh, you did it.
[28:13.46]You did it.
[28:13.72]You did it.
[28:13.96]You claimed it.
[28:14.42]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[28:15.32]No, no, no.
[28:15.60]Here.
[28:15.88]Here's another 200 bucks.
[28:17.04]Let's go up there and go see what's over in the top left.
[28:26.14]Recruit a gnome.
[28:35.69]Extort?
[28:36.29]What does that mean?
[28:40.47]Collect 226 gold instantly.
[28:42.61]For a cost of 100 gold, you just pull it quick.
[28:45.74]Okay.
[28:47.16]Anybody going up here?
[28:51.98]Let's get a tavern.
[28:59.02]It's an inn, right?
[29:00.96]Yeah.
[29:04.18]There's nothing even up here.
[29:05.34]No, I'm going to put this over here.
[29:07.78]Down by this way.
[29:11.19]This is... Kill these things.
[29:15.67]Somebody kill it.
[29:22.85]What have I got here?
[29:23.41]Let's see.
[29:26.30]I still don't understand how you get, like, shit on the main screen here.
[29:28.98]Okay.
[29:29.18]Are they gonna be okay?
[29:33.56]Can they build this down here?
[29:34.66]It's a bread and brawl.
[29:38.48]You can put the explore flag in the fog of war.
[29:40.34]Okay, that's cool.
[29:41.72]Um... No... Go get this.
[29:48.94]Look at all this shit.
[29:49.54]Is it all taken?
[29:51.14]It's all empty.
[29:54.77]Somebody go get this!
[29:59.75]Somebody get this fucking money.
[30:01.79]Right there, get it.
[30:05.13]Open it.
[30:07.71]No, open it and run.
[30:08.53]Okay, nobody's there, but they'll come down here.
[30:11.26]Peasant 6 is dead.
[30:20.53]Big Bits?
[30:20.97]Oh shit, I missed Big Bits like a minute ago.
[30:23.03]This guy's dead.
[30:25.45]Sorry, Paul.
[30:27.31]I didn't want you to go hang out down here.
[30:31.31]Thank you, Agent Dark, for the 50 bucks.
[30:35.99]5,000 bits from Agent Dark.
[30:37.29]Agent Dark booty.
[30:39.06]Jeremy, I can't tell you how much joy your streams have brought me.
[30:41.20]I have ADHD and you've honestly been an inspiration for me.
[30:43.58]Keep up the amazing work.
[30:46.12]Thank you so much, Agent Dark Booty.
[30:48.42]I have it too, and you're seeing in this stream right now how I'm dealing with it.
[30:52.94]So, thank you for the five fucking thousand bits.
[30:56.61]Really appreciate it.
[31:00.21]Thank you.
[31:02.15]He's dead.
[31:04.45]Okay, so I need to do...
[31:10.90]Should I go in the sewer?
[31:13.36]Indestructible.
[31:14.80]Appear as your kingdom grows in size.
[31:16.56]Grants giant rats and ratmen access to your town.
[31:21.91]It's needed for larger towns and therefore may not be destroyed.
[31:26.67]So it just happens because we have too many people using the sewer.
[31:30.17]Okay.
[31:30.39]I'm gonna say let's go down here.
[31:34.03]It's worth 500 bucks for someone to explore down that way.
[31:41.97]This person's just at the front.
[31:42.99]Kill this fucking person, please.
[31:45.27]Just now.
[31:45.89]Right now.
[31:46.38]Anybody.
[31:48.10]She's just sitting at the front door, camping.
[31:50.40]Our, like, newbies coming out.
[31:53.54]Where are you?
[31:59.24]Somebody going down there?
[32:02.98]Why is Jeff Goldblum in our camp?
[32:13.55]House 1.
[32:13.77]I need to build more houses?
[32:17.49]Blacksmith.
[32:18.29]My services may help.
[32:21.99]Ranger's Guild.
[32:22.85]No, I have everything I can do.
[32:24.31]Unless it's a... I can research something else somewhere.
[32:29.52]It's going down.
[32:29.94]Going down?
[32:31.48]What?
[32:33.56]We have found an abandoned keep and the missing candle.
[32:35.90]Destroy the keep and you will recover the candle.
[32:38.74]Alright.
[32:39.18]I want everybody's attention right now.
[32:43.72]$1,000 to go in there and get that.
[32:46.06]No, fuck that.
[32:48.66]It's $2,000.
[32:49.18]Oh shit, I'm getting over there!
[32:53.75]$2,000!
[32:53.77]$3,000.
[32:54.13]Elbry, where's Elbry?
[32:59.57]What are you doing?
[33:11.44]Oh, he's shooting at it.
[33:14.91]I was like, where is he?
[33:16.21]Why is he not listening to me?
[33:17.39]Okay, he's going to get this free grant.
[33:21.87]Okay, what happens if I click on this and I drop it right before it dies to like a $5 bill?
[33:28.17]Who's this?
[33:31.30]Is this a gnome?
[33:32.20]What do the gnomes do?
[33:36.98]He's going to get it.
[33:38.91]He's the one annoying unit in Command & Conquer that you're not prepared for.
[33:42.30]You don't even realize it.
[33:43.62]Anytime you've played Warcraft or Command & Conquer or Red Alert or whatever, once the towns got big enough, you could sneak in and just drop one unit to attack a farm on the outskirts and they wouldn't even know you were doing it.
[33:55.74]That was the best strategy.
[33:57.64]Our town is under attack!
[33:59.18]And you have a fucking extra large map and you don't even know where it is.
[34:05.07]You have like five citadels at that point.
[34:06.99]You're just like, where the fuck is this guy attacking?
[34:08.77]That was my strategy.
[34:11.01]Send one guy to attack the bottom of their base every single time.
[34:13.57]Alright, so we almost got this.
[34:17.31]What happened to the guy that was... He's running away.
[34:21.97]He's fleeing in terror.
[34:25.81]Somebody will get it.
[34:35.22]Alright, I need more heroes.
[34:37.08]Can I queue them up?
[34:44.47]I need more than two.
[34:52.08]Why do they keep dying?
[35:00.02]Is it possible to bake the left side bigger?
[35:03.30]It's hard to read.
[35:05.00]Yeah, I know we got a cereal block scenario over here on the left.
[35:08.86]Sorry about that.
[35:14.09]Guild is full.
[35:14.89]Guild will be full here.
[35:17.09]Alright, let's take a look.
[35:21.32]What have I got?
[35:25.08]What are they doing?
[35:27.14]Will you attack the things that are outside the door?
[35:29.04]Do you still have a $300 bounty?
[35:39.96]Somebody said, is this just constant noise, or am I really high?
[35:44.09]Uh... It's kind of... Kind of.
[35:53.61]Alright, it's time to... Okay, I've had enough of this shit.
[36:02.84]We're making it way more expensive to kill these things.
[36:07.22]They're just running absolutely rampant in the town.
[36:09.44]Like, you have to die.
[36:11.98]Everybody focus.
[36:12.86]Whoever kills them gets a thousand dollars.
[36:20.40]Who's even in here?
[36:22.44]Guild is full.
[36:23.28]Get out!
[36:29.97]Are they all dead?
[36:32.37]Where are all my heroes?
[36:35.77]Get the fuck out of here!
[36:36.91]Get out!
[36:39.87]Alright, you guys finally gonna do something?
[36:51.07]I feel revitalized.
[36:53.43]Should have had more heroes.
[36:55.31]Apparently, who is this?
[36:57.79]Naked Shrek.
[37:00.31]I'm gonna lose in the tutorial.
[37:03.88]But look, I'm gonna be really fair to myself here.
[37:07.90]This was not, I was not tutorialized at all.
[37:11.38]It was just like here, I get overrun by snakes and monsters.
[37:16.37]One of you guys in chat told me about this.
[37:19.80]No, I'm not.
[37:20.18]I'm gonna win.
[37:21.56]There's so many of them now, though.
[37:24.56]Level 9 is just sitting in there.
[37:32.93]Arrows.
[37:33.41]Better arrows, man.
[37:43.35]Spam guardhouses to survive.
[37:48.85]This is because there's two sewers.
[37:51.56]I don't remember this.
[37:52.58]Alright, I'm going to have like six towers.
[38:00.26]Look, it's already getting better.
[38:02.66]How much health does this have?
[38:06.78]This thing's going down.
[38:07.44]There's one.
[38:09.34]Okay, alright, I get it.
[38:10.30]I get it.
[38:10.62]I get it.
[38:17.93]Scan through buildings.
[38:19.77]Scan through henchmen.
[38:20.87]Scan through... Okay, so this is just what the... Okay, so when I was looking at this before, I thought this... I didn't know this was, like, scan through a building.
[38:31.06]I thought this was commands I could try to give to this person.
[38:33.52]Okay, I get it.
[38:34.20]I understand.
[38:34.84]I get it.
[38:36.96]Scan through reward flags.
[38:38.40]Yeah, I get it.
[38:38.98]I understand.
[38:39.78]I understand.
[38:40.38]I do.
[38:40.52]All right.
[38:46.29]Double click to zoom to the hero.
[38:47.41]I can just do this too.
[38:49.19]Here we go.
[38:54.34]Is he gonna get the bounty?
[38:57.96]Kill this thing too.
[38:59.22]That's a thousand dollars as well, guys.
[39:00.94]I'm upset.
[39:01.20]I'm upset.
[39:01.48]I have money.
[39:06.64]There's too many houses.
[39:10.24]Why don't you build a house right here?
[39:13.30]How dumb are you?
[39:14.36]Why would this be built here?
[39:16.30]It's right in front of the gate.
[39:19.74]This is the equivalent of having your house directly under the airport.
[39:24.48]Like, right when the planes come out.
[39:26.10]You're gonna hear this like five, ten times a day, a hundred times a day.
[39:29.65]The bridge dropping right next to your bedroom door.
[39:36.57]Okay.
[39:38.71]Tax collector!
[39:41.66]Is somebody gonna destroy this building or what?
[39:43.56]There he is.
[39:44.80]Sylvus Broadview is going for it.
[39:51.64]Get out of there!
[39:54.08]Get out of there.
[39:54.60]It's not worth it.
[39:55.18]Why don't you work together and split it?
[39:58.46]You're not gonna kill this thing alone.
[39:59.56]Get out!
[40:03.22]Sylvus is berserking.
[40:05.64]He's gonna berserk right into the dirt.

[40:51.46]We're about to get the first Triforce down here.
[40:56.63]Well, now that I know what's going on, the next thing I do will be a little bit easier.
[41:01.43]I don't really have enough money.
[41:10.03]How do you still have a thousand dollar bounty on your head, though?
[41:18.77]I don't know how that's even possible.
[41:23.97]I'm gonna scan through these flags here.
[41:27.73]Attack flag.
[41:30.31]No, get rid of that.
[41:34.36]You won't get your money back!
[41:35.50]Oh, fuck.
[41:36.04]No, never mind.
[41:36.54]I didn't know that.
[41:46.30]Okay.

[41:52.61]Alright.
[41:54.67]Uh, explorer's gonna get it.
[41:56.49]Trading post, let's see.
[42:04.64]He's gonna get it, I think.
[42:07.80]This is like a TF2 server.
[42:10.30]It kind of is, yeah.
[42:17.25]Yeah.
[42:17.77]It is.
[42:20.24]Level 11, though.
[42:21.02]Not bad.
[42:21.40]Alright, what about my blacksmith?
[42:22.94]No, no!
[42:23.20]Don't attack the blacksmith!
[42:24.30]Get that off.
[42:26.56]I want to upgrade more.
[42:27.66]How do I do better research?
[42:33.97]Inn, Marketplace, Ranger's Guild.
[42:35.81]I don't think I can do anything else.
[42:36.81]You always need at least 10 heroes.
[42:47.21]Okay.
[42:49.92]No, I had like five here, but they died instantly when they came out.
[42:52.66]Oh, who's gonna get it?
[42:56.92]Is it gonna be Fetteth the Explorer?
[43:00.30]Let's see.
[43:04.32]Medieval lemmings?
[43:05.02]That is kind of what it's like, you're right.
[43:09.15]Alright, we're good.
[43:10.25]We have as many as we can have.
[43:13.87]This thing is still going down.

[43:50.30]Somebody get it!
[43:51.10]So many voice lines.
[44:02.95]What is this thing?

[45:22.90]Because I got... There's one item just sitting there.
[45:29.11]Just extort the rogues guild.
[45:33.41]Sorry.
[45:34.61]There's construction going on outside.
[45:36.31]I don't hear... I can't even hear what you mean by this.
[45:46.51]Did anybody pick it up?
[45:47.03]No, of course not.
[45:47.57]Thank you.
[45:47.95]Nobody's claimed that yet.
[46:15.13]Weirdly enough.
[46:16.81]Alright, I'm going to follow... Henchmen.
[46:21.38]No, no.
[46:21.92]Heroes.
[46:25.64]I want to follow... Who's, like, the level... Mayor, right?

[46:30.12]Where's Maibar?
[46:31.94]There you are.
[46:32.32]Alright, I want to follow you and you.
[46:37.18]This is going to be hell going over here.
[46:41.28]Talk fight.
[46:42.23]Should I drop the audio?
[46:44.83]Should I make it like... Will that be better?
[46:51.59]You know what I mean?
[46:54.79]Maybe it won't be as chaotic and horrible sounding.
[46:58.12]That's better.
[47:02.68]It doesn't sound like four construction yards at the same time.
[47:07.16]It's the same.
[47:10.58]No, it's not.
[47:12.25]Kill it.
[47:14.41]Ooh, tough fight.
[47:17.37]Ooh, tough fight.
[47:20.47]I can't believe no one's picked this up.
[47:22.75]I'm never gonna be able to complete the mission.
[47:28.15]Well, it's obviously not top right, and obviously not top left.
[47:30.86]So it has to be like bottom left and bottom right.
[47:33.78]Do I have to make this more expensive?
[47:37.92]Thousand bucks.
[47:40.32]Alright, come on, Kevin.
[47:43.52]Claim it, Kevin.
[47:47.61]Come on, Kevin!
[47:49.25]No!
[47:56.27]Upgrade the buildings?
[47:57.09]I have been, haven't I?
[47:59.75]No, I've been upgrading the buildings.
[48:06.41]Yeah, I mean... What?
[48:12.97]Build more hunters' guilds.
[48:17.41]Alright, we're going to expand our influence over here.
[48:30.24]Wait, this is level.
[48:31.70]Click the arrow.
[48:44.41]Level.
[48:46.29]This is a troll walking around town.
[48:49.23]This town sucks.
[48:51.03]Why don't we have a fucking wall or gate or something?
[48:56.38]Why is this so normal?
[48:58.90]This should be completely abnormal.
[49:07.17]Next to the picture, level... Okay, level 2.
[49:10.03]I'm reading the goddamn cereal box!
[49:20.89]Oh my god.
[49:21.57]Alright.
[49:22.09]Okay.
[49:22.39]Alright.
[49:22.65]Alright.
[49:22.93]We're good.
[49:23.27]We're good.
[49:23.57]We're good.
[49:23.95]Everybody relax.
[49:25.83]This is the tutorial we're learning.
[49:28.47]Oh Jesus.
[49:29.73]Give me a break.
[49:30.77]I didn't even know.
[49:31.61]There was no way.
[49:33.85]Was I supposed to tell?
[49:36.98]I didn't know that.
[49:38.38]I don't know.
[49:38.96]Alright.
[49:44.98]Now we got some real guards out here.
[49:54.23]This is the 22nd tax collector.
[49:59.25]I've had a new tax collector almost each day.
[50:06.25]Alright, who do we got?
[50:08.04]Message flag.
[50:10.90]Oh, did they find it?
[50:13.14]A hero has discovered that the book lies in this ruined altar.
[50:15.96]Raise it.
[50:17.20]Okay, raise it.
[50:18.99]No, I don't want that.
[50:19.65]Remove that.
[50:23.54]We're going for a $2,000 bounty.
[50:26.96]Go for it.
[50:27.44]Good luck to all of you.
[50:29.06]Can you upgrade houses?
[50:33.25]No.
[50:33.39]Okay, I thought that was a dog downstairs.
[50:39.03]Okay.
[50:41.33]Rogue's Guild.
[50:42.15]Let's get a couple more.
[50:47.42]Do you have a building on fire?
[50:49.02]Yeah, well, what do you want me to do?
[50:54.96]I can't put it out.
[50:55.66]I need more palace guards.
[50:59.69]Level 3.
[51:01.75]You need 12 heroes to get to level 3.
[51:08.59]Blacksmith, let's do that research.
[51:10.47]Level 3 weapons.
[51:17.06]Who's taking it down?
[51:19.54]We got... Broadview.
[51:21.70]Level 10.
[51:23.54]Three grand to get that?
[51:24.70]What happens if you don't have enough money?
[51:31.59]What happens if I put the bounty up for... Alright, nice.
[51:36.81]Look at this shit over here.
[51:37.97]How the hell am I gonna do that?
[51:40.15]There's too many people.
[51:43.74]Let me go up here.
[51:47.78]Uh, armor.
[51:50.28]Let's get into the rogue.
[51:57.21]Arrows, better arrows than all these.
[51:58.67]Build some more trading posts.
[52:07.35]Your Highness, we've improved the guardhouse.
[52:10.17]Your Highness, we've improved the guardhouse.
[52:12.96]Your Highness, we've improved the guardhouse.
[52:16.18]Your Highness, we've improved the guardhouse.
[52:19.14]There you go.
[52:25.92]There's the holy book, plus 20 intelligence.
[52:30.39]Somebody, okay, who picked up the, who picked that up?
[52:39.55]Do I know who has that in their inventory?
[52:41.27]Let's go.
[52:45.42]What the fuck does this shit do?
[52:49.16]Statue.
[52:50.92]What does it do, though?
[52:53.88]I don't know what the fuck this does.
[52:57.07]I'm gonna put it over here.
[52:59.05]I don't know what this is.
[53:10.88]Statues raise the loyalty of the heroes in your kingdom.
[53:18.64]Okay.
[53:22.76]Assured that their deeds will not go unrecognized, your heroes strive to complete their quest with real... Okay, so you need a bunch of statues.
[53:31.26]Okay, cool.
[53:32.58]So, statues make people more happy and more willing to do what you want them to do.
[53:36.62]They'll listen to you, they'll... Let me clear that.
[53:39.53]Alright, let's do... what else we got?
[53:45.45]Temple of Agrillia requires no temples to Fervus Cryptochrome.
[53:53.02]Temple of Darus.
[53:54.98]Are these like elements?
[53:56.78]Is this like water?
[53:58.34]Earth?
[53:59.07]Fire?
[54:00.13]Metal?
[54:00.41]I don't know.
[54:02.15]Let's do this one.
[54:03.89]Let's put this down here.
[54:07.03]Temple to Chrom.
[54:21.30]Not Chrom.
[54:22.30]Why?
[54:22.94]Chrom?
[54:23.40]What do you mean, why?
[54:24.20]What?
[54:29.65]What's wrong with Chrom?
[54:33.17]Wait, can I not have any... I can't have any of the temp... requires a... Give me another trading post up here.
[54:43.79]You can't build any of the temples that build Chrom.
[54:48.26]Well, whatever.
[54:48.82]That's fine.
[54:54.51]I need a garrhouse down here.
[54:57.63]This is fucking bad.
[55:05.36]You can now not build any temples.
[55:07.78]Yeah, well, I'm almost done with the tutorial.
[55:08.96]I just have to clear the spider den.
[55:12.87]Why would you do that?
[55:14.57]Why are you guys coming all the way down here?
[55:23.55]No, don't aggro all of them.
[55:25.47]Don't you know that's the biggest mistake in top-down Goldshire?
[55:29.87]Don't do that.
[55:31.21]You're gonna aggro everybody.
[55:33.48]Biggest mistake.
[55:34.72]Level 8.
[55:35.40]That's why.
[55:35.92]You can tell.
[55:36.60]You're new to the game.
[55:37.52]Don't do it.
[55:40.60]Oh, he's gonna do it.
[55:42.62]You did it.
[55:43.42]You fucked it all up.
[55:47.03]Sorry, you're like older brothers not here to power word shield you.
[55:51.96]To make sure that you have fun playing the game because you're doing so terribly that your older brother knows that he has to fucking play priest.
[56:01.58]And he's doing everything possible to keep you alive while you just dick around and shoot at monsters.
[56:11.23]What?
[56:12.79]I told you.
[56:13.83]I told you you got an older brother with you.

[57:06.07]Okay, then brother's out of mana.
[57:08.14]So he comes up and tries to pull aggro.
[57:12.74]It's alright, man.
[57:13.26]It's okay.
[57:13.90]What happened?
[57:15.61]Uh, well, you... You stood there a little too long.
[57:19.31]But, it's okay.
[57:20.31]Just run back.
[57:21.93]Do you see the mini-map?
[57:22.81]I don't see the mini-map!
[57:24.51]Okay, hold on.
[57:25.41]Fuck.
[57:25.71]Okay, let me move.
[57:26.61]Let me go in the other room where you are.
[57:28.65]And, like, do it for you.
[57:35.68]There it is.
[57:39.62]The bell has been located in this ruined shrine.
[57:41.64]Destroy the shrine and reclaim what is yours.
[57:43.60]How am I gonna do this?
[57:44.32]Is this a tutorial?
[57:46.93]This is a fucking tutorial.
[57:48.85]And you're going to surround this with enemies?

[58:23.61]Enrage your heroes with Chrom's power for 1500 bucks.
[58:29.01]You guys did something wrong?
[58:30.63]You don't like that?
[58:37.56]What's wrong with the Barbarian?
[58:43.82]I should just do all barbarians.
[58:54.07]These guys are expensive.
[59:04.45]These things are like level one.
[59:06.77]They're only level one though.

[60:24.86]Where is this guy?
[60:30.36]Oh.
[60:30.68]Oh, here we go.
[60:32.62]We've got a bandit here.
[60:34.70]This is probably going to diff you to leave, too.
[60:43.29]I hope this guy comes over and just snipes it.
[60:48.16]Tough fight, tough fight, tough fight.
[60:52.16]No, they're not ready for this.
[60:53.38]I gotta pull the bounty.
[60:55.46]Wait a minute.
[60:56.14]Come on.
[60:57.87]You can do it.

[62:25.58]Chrom is the best.
[62:33.57]Just use this movement speed increase to get over here.
[62:37.23]Is it just the last hit?
[62:38.09]Whoever gets the last hit?
[62:41.29]No, it's spread out.
[62:42.15]That's cool.
[62:42.45]Well, that's it.
[62:43.88]Thank you!
[62:51.33]Now I understand what's going on.
[62:53.01]The bell, book, and candle are back in their rightful place.
[62:57.08]We also found the thief who stole them from the castle.
[63:00.46]A rogue identified as Cherik of Keldurn.
[63:03.70]Unfortunately, he escaped while being returned to the castle.
[63:07.06]With a 15,000 gold piece reward on his head, I'm sure he'll think long and hard before returning to our kingdom.
[63:15.22]Alright, Chirik.
[63:18.06]Total gold, 55,000.
[63:19.46]9800.
[63:20.04]Almost 98,500.
[63:21.30]Would have been interesting.
[63:23.94]Total gold spent.
[63:24.90]Spent on research.
[63:25.62]Spent on buildings.
[63:26.32]Spent on heroes.
[63:27.04]Spent on spells.
[63:29.72]Cool.
[63:30.60]Visits to elven lounge or gambling hall.
[63:34.48]What?
[63:38.04]You can do that?
[63:38.65]49 heroes recruited.
[63:41.67]42 dead.
[63:45.72]Yeah, but I had, like, no... Look, now I understand to, like, keep them leveled up, keep them happy, get some guardhouses, make sure there's some taverns, make sure there's some gambling halls in case they feel like playing a couple of games, like, fucking Kino.
[64:00.47]157 dead.
[64:02.81]For henchmen.
[64:06.61]Alright, cool.
[64:09.64]No, no, I don't... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[64:14.06]I want a menu!
[64:16.79]Yeah, what?
[64:21.05]I can pick missions.
[64:24.56]What?
[64:25.68]What happened?
[64:36.18]It's saved?
[64:42.81]Uh, it was saved.
[64:44.65]Yeah, but what... wasn't there a map?
[64:49.36]Click on the map!
[64:49.88]Click on the map!
[64:50.36]Click on the map!
[64:52.90]Okay, here we go.
[64:53.42]Strike out on your own.
[64:55.38]This one's done.
[65:08.91]Okay, let's see.
[65:10.88]I'm not doing anything advanced.
[65:12.78]I don't care what you guys say.
[65:17.36]Do the advanced one.
[65:18.32]Do the event not in a million years.
[65:23.44]Okay, let's see.
[65:24.58]The wizard's curse.
[65:26.22]The forsaken land.
[65:28.72]Rescue the prince.
[65:31.02]I think I want to do rescue the prince.
[65:34.48]Rescue the prince.
[65:35.76]I'm going for it.
[65:37.10]This morning, while cleaning out the royal courier pigeon roost, a servant noticed an unfamiliar bird.
[65:43.90]Attached to its leg was a message.
[65:45.82]It reads, I'm trapped in a tower of an evil wizard.
[65:50.18]Please, please, please rescue me.
[65:52.71]My mother, the Queen of Valmorgan, will richly reward you.
[65:57.33]Scouts confirm that the young prince of Valmorgan recently vanished while on a hunting trip.
[66:02.51]The reward and goodwill generated by this rescue would do our kingdom well.
[66:09.61]Game glitched?
[66:10.57]What do you mean?
[66:12.60]We heard the voice twice.
[66:13.92]That's weird.
[66:16.34]I'll tab for a second.
[66:17.70]I think that's what happened.
[66:21.82]That's weird.
[66:24.04]Alright, so this morning, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[66:27.53]I'm trapped in the tower of an evil wizard.
[66:28.99]Please, please rescue me.
[66:30.11]My mother will reward you handsomely.
[66:32.59]Okay.
[66:35.55]Vanished on a hunting trip.
[66:38.24]Here we go.
[66:40.38]I'm ready.
[66:42.68]Destroy the tower prison in which the prince is imprisoned to... That's a mouthful.
[66:48.68]Destroy the tower prison in which the prince is imprisoned to win this epic...
[66:58.76]Use the magic spell of your wizard's guild to help you.
[67:13.87]I'm getting older every day.
[67:15.63]Old people do that shit and like I always wonder why.
[67:22.49]If an old person is talking to you, they're like, yes, I remember when I was your age.
[67:29.23]It was very fun.
[67:30.45]And you're like, holy shit, how the fuck are you out of control like that?
[67:34.45]It happens.
[67:35.03]It just does.
[67:40.33]Okay, here we go.
[67:42.31]No temples.
[67:43.37]Use the magic spells of your wizard's guild.
[67:46.92]I don't know what that means.
[67:47.50]I'm sure we're going to figure it out.
[67:49.26]No temples, non-human races, or rangers' guilds are available.
[67:54.21]So I can't have temples.
[67:57.31]I have to have only humans.
[68:00.45]And rangers' guilds are not allowed.
[68:02.05]Well, rangers' guilds are available.
[68:04.52]No, no, they're not.
[68:05.20]None of this is.
[68:05.76]Okay, interesting.
[68:06.48]Let's go.
[68:07.38]Alright, I'm ready.
[68:07.94]Here we go.
[68:08.52]Easy, easy, easy.
[68:10.52]I forget everything.
[68:11.16]I forget fucking everything.
[68:12.26]No, I don't.
[68:14.30]So, pause it.
[68:16.04]I don't care, I'm pausing it.
[68:19.71]Cast spells from your wizard's guild to help find the prince and defeat your enemies.
[68:24.39]Okay.
[68:25.73]Upgrade your wizard's guild to get access to more powerful spells, then expand their range by building a network of wizard's towers.
[68:31.71]Okay.
[68:34.51]Cool.
[68:38.28]So, wizard's spells.
[68:39.90]Farseeing.
[68:41.22]Invisibility.
[68:43.89]All right.
[68:44.78]First of all, we've got to get this shit going right now.
[68:48.78]Get a guardhouse here.
[68:52.84]Since you can't... Hold on.
[68:54.50]Since you can't use rangers to aid you in this quest, rely on the Farseeing spell from your wizard skill to explore the hidden areas.
[69:00.39]Yeah, I get it.
[69:01.73]Okay.
[69:01.83]Okay.
[69:06.20]So, I need to get some people here.
[69:07.36]I serve with pleasure.
[69:09.02]We need a... We need a... We need a... A warrior's guild.
[69:12.48]Let's get it up there now.
[69:13.34]Now, now, now, now, now, now.
[69:14.92]How much is that?
[69:22.99]Farsing to... Okay.
[69:24.05]Farsing.
[69:24.47]Do I have to do... Oh, okay, okay.
[69:34.15]How much...
[69:36.23]Your Highness, if our kingdom is to prosper, it needs more heroes.
[69:46.99]Holy shit, that's a lot of money.
[69:48.07]All right, stop counting.
[69:48.97]How much is this cast?
[69:50.87]How much does this cost?
[69:52.59]Okay, I got it.
[69:55.77]Get out there.
[69:56.73]Are the rats all hostile?
[70:00.56]I need a... We need an inn.
[70:03.14]Let's get an inn over here.
[70:05.63]Right here.
[70:06.03]We already have some shit here.
[70:07.71]Marketplace, guardhouse, library.
[70:11.00]Arrows better in this guardhouse place.
[70:12.30]Research the library.
[70:13.10]What's in the library?
[70:15.54]All research costs are reduced by 5%.
[70:17.34]Pretty sick.

[70:27.18]Okay.
[70:27.64]Upgrading this library adds a plus spell.
[70:29.39]So it just makes everything better.
[70:31.05]Wizards can learn powerful spells at the library once you have researched them.

[71:59.45]I have to do this.
[72:01.17]You know, this is like when somebody that's like level 40 comes to Goldshire and just follows the fucking level 1 around.
[72:09.98]This is from the other faction.
[72:11.54]Just being like a trolling weirdo.
[72:15.82]And that person doesn't even know why this doesn't make any sense.
[72:20.26]There's a player following me.
[72:23.55]I have to keep making that reference.
[72:25.67]And I'm going to continue to.
[72:27.11]And there's just a fucking werewolf here.
[72:33.54]God damn it.
[72:36.68]Can you do anything else?

[74:17.34]Don't... Well, don't abandon the one person that you... Alright, what does this message say?
[74:23.26]Upgrading your marketplace increases the rate and amount of money they bring into your realm.
[74:26.92]Be sure to keep up your income so that you can pay for your spells from the Wizard's Guild.
[74:30.51]Okay.
[74:33.35]Healing potions.

[74:54.97]I don't have enough money.
[74:56.33]Alright.
[74:58.57]The warrior's guild is going fine.
[74:59.85]I gotta get my blacksmith.
[75:04.85]Research.

[76:10.67]Alright.
[76:12.90]Guard house is going up.
[76:14.60]All right.
[76:15.20]We need to build a couple of... I need another mage tower down here.
[76:22.15]Destroy that creature then.
[76:23.79]Let's give it a thousand bucks to get rid of that.
[76:28.21]This is good.
[76:33.65]All right.
[76:34.47]I need to make some more... I'm going to make another blacksmith tower or something.
[76:38.12]I don't know what the fuck it's called.
[76:39.40]You know what I mean.
[76:42.94]Library.
[76:44.86]Magic resistance.
[76:46.24]Remember the other inn?

[77:11.29]Wizard's Tower.
[77:13.15]What is that?
[77:13.75]Wizard's Guild?
[77:14.51]Wizard's Tower.
[77:15.35]What?
[77:16.21]I don't know what this does.
[77:21.27]Alright.
[77:21.57]Watch the bears.
[77:22.31]Watch the bears.
[77:22.94]The bears.
[77:23.24]The bears.
[77:25.58]Kill the bear.
[77:27.48]Kill both bears.
[77:33.25]Get rid of these.
[77:34.73]Don't let them just, like, run absolutely fucking... Ugh.
[77:38.59]Is this rat gonna... Kill the rat, too.
[77:41.33]100 bucks.
[77:41.83]200 bucks, too, if it kills the rat.
[77:43.07]Alright, what is this doing?
[77:55.06]I'm done for!
[77:56.42]Alright, repair this.
[78:02.81]Level it up, dude.
[78:04.85]Alright, I got plenty of... What's going on down here?
[78:07.11]Alright, he's collecting.
[78:08.05]What's in that chest?
[78:11.27]Don't do this by yourself.
[78:12.47]That's a mistake.
[78:13.35]Don't be an idiot.
[78:15.94]Trading post.
[78:16.54]Healing potions.
[78:17.60]Ah, fuck.
[78:18.04]I need healing potions over here, too.
[78:20.32]Protection rings.
[78:21.60]Ooh, that's cool.
[78:25.63]What's his skill?
[78:26.11]Level 2.
[78:26.25]Let's go.
[78:26.47]Good.
[78:26.65]How we doing on... I want the bounty flag to be on this camera.
[78:29.97]This camera needs to be just following a little bit healthy character.
[78:34.01]He's going for it.
[78:34.75]Level 2, though.
[78:35.35]That's bad.
[78:35.59]Kill it.
[78:52.56]Together.
[78:52.98]Work together.
[78:53.98]Alright.
[78:54.90]Get it.
[78:56.76]Take out this creature, then.
[79:02.70]Statues there.
[79:03.48]This is just... Oh, here we go.
[79:05.42]That's a level 5 right there.
[79:06.42]Good.
[79:07.64]Anything else going on?
[79:11.17]Watch it.
[79:11.49]Alright.
[79:11.79]We got aggro.
[79:12.47]Uh-oh.
[79:12.63]Take it out.
[79:13.09]Kill it.
[79:25.98]Holy shit.
[79:27.32]It's one swipe to kill.
[79:29.47]How could you do that?
[79:34.51]I mean, that was a pretty ballsy play, but it was dumb.
[79:38.45]Anti-magic?
[79:39.13]I can just cast a lightning bolt down here, can't I?
[79:41.83]Alright, this den is dead.
[79:47.55]Get rid of this one, too.
[79:48.29]Okay.
[79:51.81]That's where the bears are coming from.
[79:54.15]Obelisk?
[79:56.69]Turn back.
[79:58.33]Okay, how we doing?
[80:01.48]How much money do I have?
[80:02.30]Not a whole lot.
[80:07.58]How do I fucking make some more money?
[80:09.84]Market day.
[80:15.63]That was not a whole lot of money.
[80:16.79]Alright.
[80:17.75]My trading post is here.
[80:18.75]I gotta get down here.
[80:19.81]We have to explore.
[80:20.43]I need to build my influence.
[80:27.26]I probably shouldn't have done level 2 palace that quickly.
[80:31.26]Alright.
[80:33.04]In the marketplace.
[80:36.34]Let's get it down here.
[80:47.21]Nice job.
[80:50.19]Don't let it kill you.
[80:51.03]You're like my biggest hero.
[80:53.59]You're the best hero, I think, so far.
[80:55.57]Quick parry.
[80:57.52]Yeah.
[80:58.20]I gotta get this guy to level 10.
[80:59.20]Nice.
[81:01.16]He's confident.
[81:01.84]He's good.
[81:02.50]Alright, I need to do... Uh-oh.
[81:04.28]Ratmen.
[81:05.34]Bounty.
[81:07.28]500 bucks to the person that kills this guy.
[81:08.68]Quick.
[81:09.46]He's gonna kill all the peasants.
[81:15.43]Veteran guards.
[81:17.93]Level 2 armor.
[81:18.99]And then I gotta level this up right now.
[81:19.99]Come on.
[81:23.43]Get up there!
[81:23.91]Come on, please!
[81:27.33]More bears!
[81:28.14]Marketplace done.
[81:29.18]Healing potions.
[81:30.06]I'm gonna be running out of money here.
[81:32.24]Oh shit.
[81:47.46]Not good.
[81:50.70]No!
[81:52.83]No, please!
[81:54.67]Not my levels five and sixes!
[81:58.47]Get over there quick!
[82:00.61]And kill this guy!
[82:05.72]I'm just doing only upgrades to the, uh, to armor and weapons.
[82:11.22]I serve with pleasure.
[82:16.60]Kill it.
[82:17.92]Marketplace.
[82:19.94]That's fine.
[82:20.46]Market day is good.
[82:23.95]Magic resistance.
[82:24.97]Train intelligence.
[82:26.69]Increase the intelligence of wizards.
[82:31.97]What's down here?
[82:32.61]Oh, come on.
[82:33.55]Don't let him kill it.
[82:34.22]He's gonna kill you.
[82:35.54]Kill this guy, please!
[82:46.40]There's two of these.
[82:47.48]Oh god.
[82:48.16]Everybody get down here.
[82:50.02]Why?
[82:50.14]Look, everybody's fucking running down here.
[82:54.60]Good.
[82:55.49]At least you're protecting your town.
[82:59.59]Come on!
[83:02.55]No, just please repair it.
[83:04.45]Don't let it... You idiots!
[83:05.55]Oh my god.
[83:08.76]Build another one.
[83:09.48]How much was that?
[83:16.81]Just go look over there for something.
[83:19.70]I need more guard towers.
[83:23.78]Yeah.
[83:24.48]Let's go.
[83:24.94]Let's do guard towers first.
[83:31.92]Guard tower here.
[83:32.76]Guard tower here.
[83:33.52]He's gonna die.
[83:38.97]Are you not gonna die?
[83:41.77]Lightning strike.
[83:43.69]Lightning strike.
[83:45.01]Not far away enough.
[83:47.87]I can't believe he's still alive.
[83:53.40]Come on.
[84:01.37]These mage towers... The wizard's towers increase range.
[84:04.21]Okay.
[84:06.31]He's just still running around.
[84:07.43]Alright, I need another warrior's guild.
[84:11.31]Fuck.
[84:12.01]All right, I need other shit.
[84:13.91]What else do I need?
[84:14.55]I have no money.
[84:16.53]I need, like, a rogue's guild.
[84:17.91]Broad sword, full plate armor.
[84:19.86]He doesn't have any.
[84:20.56]He has 900 bucks.
[84:21.10]All right, finally.
[84:21.60]Get this shit built up.
[84:36.71]Your Majesty, a new building is complete.
[84:39.49]I only have a thousand bucks.
[84:40.47]Where are my tax collectors?
[84:45.47]Tax collector.
[84:46.01]Your Majesty, a new building is complete.
[84:53.94]No, no, no, no.
[84:54.70]Do not kill the tax collector.
[84:57.24]All right, minimum return.
[84:58.44]He will not return to palace unless he carries at least this amount in gold.
[85:03.46]Minimum amount of building must hold before visiting.
[85:06.29]That's fine.
[85:07.85]Pick up like 500 bucks, man.
[85:09.83]Holy shit, that was $1,300.
[85:12.57]Alright, don't let this guy die, please.
[85:14.99]Protect him.
[85:15.87]He's gonna get a ton of money.
[85:17.13]Alright, what do we got?
[85:24.73]A little six.
[85:25.27]What do you have?
[85:26.25]Fire shield.
[85:27.91]Wooden staff.
[85:28.79]No armor.
[85:29.43]Why do you have no armor?
[85:31.36]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[85:34.54]Level three weapons.
[85:42.42]Level one, you're dead in one hit.
[85:44.53]What a waste of money.
[85:46.71]My prowess is unmatched.
[85:48.89]No, you're just dead.
[85:49.59]Your Highness, we've improved the guardhouse.
[85:52.59]Your Highness, we've improved the guardhouse.
[85:56.48]Majesty, the local blacksmith offers new services.
[86:02.79]Level 3 armor, level 3 weapons.
[86:07.77]Again, I need to look at this.
[86:09.87]And here's another one of these idiots.
[86:11.51]Bounty.
[86:14.07]Alright, somebody has to go this way.
[86:17.95]We need exploration down here.
[86:19.87]You're actually not doing a bad job.
[86:21.37]That's Quick Parry.
[86:22.67]He's pretty good.
[86:23.15]What's he got on him?
[86:25.55]Ring of Protection plus 10 Dodge Parry.
[86:29.19]Well, I mean, his name is Quick Parry, so that's why he bought it.
[86:34.86]Okay, what about Hydea?
[86:36.59]Alright, good.
[86:38.45]You need to stay alive.
[86:43.31]Come on, don't die here.
[86:45.15]Level 7, don't die!
[86:48.07]Somebody get over here!
[86:49.11]Where's Quick Parry?
[86:52.09]Actually holding your own.
[86:56.63]How many potions do you have?
[86:59.37]No, no more, no more.
[87:00.41]Come on, come on!
[87:00.97]Kill it!
[87:05.09]This guy's level 7!
[87:06.15]Does he have normal potions?
[87:09.47]He has normal potions.
[87:10.47]Kill him!
[87:11.59]Help him!
[87:12.75]You idiot!
[87:13.53]Why would you just turn away?
[87:15.75]You don't deserve the money if you get this.
[87:22.18]Fuck!
[87:25.32]Alright, I need... I got 2200 bucks.
[87:29.42]That was my best mage, yeah.
[87:36.14]Do I get the money?
[87:39.77]God damn it.
[87:41.09]Okay, um, I need another warrior.
[87:47.51]Level 3.
[87:48.31]I'm going with... I gotta get more armor.
[87:51.35]I need another trading post, too.
[87:52.51]How much money does this, uh, put out?
[87:56.81]I'm doing a trading post, uh, down here.
[87:59.03]Is that stupid?
[88:00.71]Is that dumb?
[88:01.23]For me to put, like, another trading post down there?
[88:03.27]Is that dumb?
[88:08.10]Yes.
[88:08.34]Okay.
[88:08.56]It's dumb.
[88:09.02]It's very dumb.
[88:09.58]All right.
[88:10.43]Because it has to be near one of these, right?
[88:17.45]I'm going to do... Oh, God.
[88:23.86]How much money do I got?
[88:26.16]Let's see.
[88:27.06]All right.
[88:28.10]Good.
[88:28.34]Quick parry is going down here.
[88:32.00]Keep exploring down here.
[88:33.22]I need another wizard's tower over here to do like the...
[88:38.50]Fucking rat.
[88:43.60]Alright.
[88:47.01]You know what?
[88:47.33]Just... Just go look over here.
[88:50.81]Just go down there.
[88:51.47]Have you?
[88:53.59]Veteran guards.
[88:55.11]Future guards are tougher out of here.
[88:58.17]Good.
[89:06.29]Warriors Guild, that's upgraded.
[89:08.05]Call to Arms.
[89:10.53]Ooh!
[89:12.59]That's helpful.
[89:14.79]That's really helpful.
[89:15.47]Okay, they go down here.
[89:19.26]We're looking for the Prince, right?
[89:27.80]They should kill this.
[89:28.88]At least I hope they do.
[89:29.51]Where are you guys going?
[89:32.97]I like this team here.
[89:33.77]Level 7, Level 6.
[89:36.62]Get that bear.
[89:42.08]Don't do it alone, don't do it alone.
[89:44.82]Oh, he was going to get the bounty.
[89:47.60]Shit, okay.
[89:48.48]Well... Go explore.
[89:51.04]How much do I want to do?
[89:54.03]5700 bucks.
[89:55.95]I wanted to do this, right?
[89:58.71]Research level 4 weapons.
[90:05.28]And I'm doing another... We're doing another inn over here.
[90:12.41]So they hang out over this way.
[90:13.81]And also I'm going to do a... A rogues guild over here.
[90:20.95]Get out of there, Quick Parry.
[90:22.10]Bad move.
[90:22.98]He's actually pretty fucking unstoppable.
[90:25.68]Uh, yeah.
[90:25.96]Quick Parry, unstoppable.
[90:37.40]He's doing great.
[90:40.12]He's so dead.
[90:40.78]No, he's just fine.
[90:43.38]He's going to get this.
[90:45.06]Don't let him snipe that from you.
[90:54.55]Get it, Quick Parry.
[90:55.41]It's yours.
[90:57.11]You're the best of the whole team.
[91:03.39]Just collect the bounty so you have some money.
[91:06.23]Get that bounty.
[91:08.65]Get it.
[91:09.23]Okay, you got 200 bucks.
[91:10.30]Good.
[91:11.54]Quick pair.
[91:13.12]You're kind of concerning me, though.
[91:14.04]I don't want you to run into death.
[91:17.04]He is kind of unbeatable, though.
[91:19.26]Although two bears.
[91:19.98]I don't know.
[91:20.90]I can't tell him to leave.
[91:21.70]He's going to do his thing.
[91:24.55]Okay.
[91:24.79]What the fuck do I want to do?
[91:27.01]Another guardhouse?
[91:27.71]Let's put another guardhouse here.
[91:29.85]I can't put it anywhere.
[91:36.53]Come on!
[91:37.19]I need it, like, over here.
[91:38.13]Right here.
[91:41.48]This is bears walking around.
[91:42.70]Alright, what do we got?
[91:43.28]Okay, good.
[91:51.50]Rogue's Guild is here.
[91:52.44]Upgraded to level 2.
[91:54.52]I'm gonna build a guard tower down here.
[92:05.01]Guardhouse level 3.
[92:05.95]Guardhouse level 3.
[92:08.57]I want another guardhouse down here.
[92:09.97]Looks good.
[92:13.98]Looks good.
[92:14.50]Level 4 armor.
[92:16.88]Get it.
[92:17.32]I fucking love rats.
[92:20.36]They're pretty cool, aren't they?
[92:27.86]Okay.
[92:29.07]Marketplace level three.
[92:30.65]Teleportation amulets.
[92:32.77]Pretty sick.
[92:33.23]Let's get some ropes.
[92:34.33]Give me your money.
[92:35.31]Alright, I'm going to put a wizard's tower down here.
[92:57.84]They're going right from the guild into the inn.
[93:02.96]These guys suck.
[93:06.77]Dumbass rogues.
[93:10.17]Alright, so this is level 3 now.
[93:15.04]I just went out and got a Shake Shack burger on your recommendation, and what do you think?
[93:20.46]Pretty great, right?
[93:24.08]I would say.
[93:24.96]I can't wait to hear your review.
[93:27.65]This is a terrible place for that to be.
[93:28.91]Alright.
[93:29.73]Level 3.
[93:30.67]I need 12 heroes.
[93:33.47]These guys are all the way down here, huh?
[93:39.64]They gave me... No, I'm not going to say that out loud because it's bullshit.
[93:44.32]Alright.
[93:45.16]I'm going to put another wizard's tower down here.
[93:52.23]Right?
[94:00.07]Can I do that?
[94:03.15]It has to be, like, within the distance of this.
[94:04.67]I can go down here.
[94:07.84]That might have been really dumb.
[94:09.92]I don't know.
[94:16.18]Quick parry.
[94:16.68]Just farming levels on bears.
[94:19.26]Not a big deal.
[94:24.91]Has to be in range of the guild tower.
[94:26.59]Okay.
[94:32.06]So then now that this is here... I can do this, right?
[94:36.62]Yep.
[94:39.18]There's nothing over here.
[94:44.20]Nothing over here?
[94:44.73]Alright, well, let's keep... Down to the right?
[94:47.79]Um...
[94:56.30]Enchant the tower, you can make it a turret.
[94:58.84]Oh, shit.
[94:59.50]Let's go down here.
[95:08.60]Uh, 300 bucks.
[95:08.98]400, I guess.
[95:10.91]And then, like, 200 bucks to go down here.
[95:17.03]Oh, that's nice.
[95:17.55]That actually works.
[95:20.49]I'm just gonna make, like... Okay, I gotta build something here.
[95:22.87]I gotta have something right here.
[95:24.77]Um... I don't know.
[95:26.89]Another wizard's tower, maybe?
[95:34.54]Quick Parry's level 10.
[95:35.22]Yeah, he's gonna be... He's gonna carry everybody.
[95:41.42]It goes, uh... Where's Quick Parry?
[95:43.36]I wanna always be following Quick Parry.
[95:44.80]I'm outta here.
[95:48.44]Delicious.
[95:50.52]Okay, this is the second one.
[95:52.26]Quick Parry is hanging out in the inn right now.
[95:55.24]Okay, just always have a camera on Quick Parry.
[95:56.64]And he has like a teleportation ring.
[95:58.09]Ooh, creature down.
[95:58.65]Get it.
[96:04.53]Kill it.
[96:06.19]Oh, you got... You did what you were supposed to do, but I didn't have to pay you any money, so that's good.
[96:12.61]Trading post.
[96:14.83]Down... We're down here.
[96:18.52]That's actually not a good idea.
[96:19.54]Let's see what we got.
[96:28.81]Put it close to one of the guardhouses?
[96:31.59]Oh, fuck.
[96:33.25]Who just died?
[96:33.73]That was in Quick Parry, right?
[96:35.87]Fuck.
[96:38.97]Get those taxes.
[96:43.67]More.
[96:45.25]More money.
[96:45.77]Alright, Quick Parry's going down here.
[96:49.35]Everyone wants to follow Quick Parry because he's just so good.
[96:52.17]How many potions does he have?
[96:53.80]Five.
[96:54.04]You need more than that, don't you?
[97:01.52]Oh, you motherfucker.
[97:02.34]Get him out of here.
[97:03.32]Alright, this is as far as it can go.
[97:09.80]We'll go level three.
[97:11.50]Not yet.
[97:11.82]Need more.
[97:12.50]Rogue's Guild.
[97:16.49]Five is the max carry for potions?
[97:17.73]Oh, okay.
[97:19.89]Makes sense.
[97:21.05]The burger was good, a little too salty.
[97:22.65]Definitely an S tier, though, for fast food.
[97:25.07]Oh, yeah.
[97:28.49]Yep.
[97:28.93]We got the official review.
[97:30.15]Fries kind of suck.
[97:31.70]Yeah, that's... they do.
[97:32.86]Alright, I can almost do level three.
[97:45.54]What are we doing down here?
[97:46.46]Oh, look at this fucking party down here.
[97:50.87]Keep going.
[97:53.43]I'm gonna beat it right now.
[97:58.37]Stay together.
[97:59.89]Take the whole thing.
[98:02.23]Ash House in Vegas was great.
[98:04.37]I'm so happy that somebody ate there.
[98:10.51]Quick parry, gonna go and just kind of take this whole thing by himself.
[98:15.67]Go rescue him by yourself, dude.
[98:20.29]He even helps out his teammates.
[98:22.61]How do I keep this guy around forever?
[98:24.75]Uh, HashHauserGoGo in the link is... The burgers are just un-fucking-believable.
[98:29.50]The food's unbelievable.
[98:30.46]It's up in 24 hours.
[98:32.04]If you're ever in Las Vegas, do yourself a favor.
[98:35.52]And eat that.
[98:36.34]Just eat at HashHauserGoGo.
[98:37.50]It's like the best fucking, like, at least late night restaurant in Vegas.
[98:43.36]Uh, where the hell is this prince?
[98:44.78]Okay, I'm gonna build down here.
[98:48.08]We kind of cleared this out.
[98:48.92]Let's do, um... There's an inn here.
[98:52.06]Let's do... Can I build another, like, citadel?
[98:56.58]I can't, right?
[98:59.58]Level three.
[99:00.10]Let's go.
[99:06.85]Do your best, Jay Leno, impression.
[99:08.37]Okay.
[99:09.55]Uh, okay.
[99:11.45]Recruit rogue.
[99:19.25]I got pretty much full on all that.
[99:21.33]Marketplace is good.
[99:25.23]What do I want to build down here?
[99:28.65]I'm going to build another wizard's guild.
[99:32.69]Or a marketplace.
[99:34.53]Yeah, fuck it.
[99:35.01]Let's go.
[99:35.35]I guess I get it right here.
[99:37.87]Fairgrounds?
[99:44.82]Alright, hold on.
[99:46.17]Royal Gardens?
[99:47.25]I need a wizard's tower.
[99:50.13]I need some, like... I can't.
[99:52.15]I need a wizard's... No, it's so expensive.
[99:53.51]I need a guardhouse here.
[99:57.95]Keep Quick Parry down here!
[99:59.01]Uh-oh.
[100:00.57]Oh, shit.
[100:01.12]What is this?
[100:03.74]Oh, fuck.
[100:04.40]That's a Minotaur.
[100:06.34]Quick Parry, get him!
[100:08.08]Both of you, together.
[100:08.80]Work together.
[100:09.30]I haven't seen that before.
[100:12.33]Come on, Quick Parry, do it!
[100:14.45]Oh fuck, he's really strong.
[100:15.77]Quick Parry, run away!
[100:16.94]Run away, Quick Parry!
[100:19.04]You can't, you're not gonna be able to do it.
[100:20.20]Oh no, he has healing potions.
[100:28.30]Alright, good.
[100:29.58]Keep it going.
[100:30.48]Protect this area, Quick Parry.
[100:36.02]Try to keep the marketplaces close to the palace because the tax collector needs to get all the way to them.
[100:39.73]That's true.
[100:40.15]All right.
[100:41.25]The peasants are down here.
[100:42.11]Let's do a mage guild tower.
[100:45.91]No, no, no, no.
[100:48.22]Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
[100:50.88]Let's do a... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[100:53.02]An inn.
[100:53.32]Put an inn down here.
[100:53.98]Quick.
[100:54.16]Come on, come on, come on.
[100:54.64]Stay, stay, stay.
[100:55.02]It's down here.
[100:55.42]I'm going to do another... An inn.
[100:59.89]I'm going to do a trading post.
[101:02.17]That might be dumb.
[101:02.89]I don't know.
[101:06.88]Statue?
[101:08.40]We're building a whole nother town down here.
[101:10.32]Wizards Guild, right there.
[101:14.17]Bingo.
[101:14.57]Got it.
[101:14.89]Creature Den.
[101:15.29]Get rid of that.
[101:15.81]Got the inn.
[101:16.23]Nice.
[101:16.47]Now we can hang out in here.
[101:19.85]Got a guard house.
[101:20.39]Get those arrows.
[101:35.34]Your Majesty, a new building is complete.
[101:39.04]All right, this is gonna be a victory here.
[101:40.38]My ambition has paid off.
[101:43.00]Your Highness, we've improved the guardhouse.
[101:45.34]There's so many bears down here.
[101:46.34]Your Majesty, a new building is complete.
[101:48.06]I got it.
[101:48.48]Trading post, complete.
[101:49.56]Your Majesty, a new building is complete.
[101:51.94]Wizard's Guild, complete.
[101:54.82]Let's get some wizards.
[101:58.58]You won't get my gold.
[102:00.12]Your Majesty, your trading post now offers healing potions.
[102:03.85]All right, I'm almost out of money.
[102:07.81]Creature Den.
[102:08.39]Get that for 200 bucks.
[102:10.57]300 bucks.
[102:12.58]What the hell are you doing?
[102:18.34]What a delicious looking reward.
[102:24.78]What a delicious looking reward.
[102:27.84]Hold on!
[102:28.40]Wait!
[102:32.41]Hold on.
[102:32.81]What the hell are you guys doing?
[102:34.91]This better save.
[102:41.77]This is gonna crash my game.
[102:42.75]Alright, what the fuck are you doing?
[102:58.88]What are you guys spamming?
[103:17.39]I don't know.
[103:17.91]I don't know what this is.
[103:18.91]What is this?
[103:19.63]This is on camera.
[103:20.44]I don't know what the fuck this is.
[103:40.72]I mean, it's clearly on a stream.
[103:42.90]I don't know what the context is.
[103:44.60]It's probably a deepfake.
[103:45.68]Is that a deepfake?
[103:46.66]It might be a deepfake.
[103:47.42]No, this is from... I think that's a deepfake.
[103:50.52]You tried, though.
[104:07.22]That sounds like something I would say.
[104:09.70]And maybe.
[104:10.14]It depends on the context.
[104:15.48]Does anybody know what that's from?
[104:17.45]It was from Super Fight.
[104:24.27]Oh, okay.
[104:25.03]That makes sense.
[104:27.68]Yeah, Super Fight Ways you had to come up with insane scenarios as to why your character would beat the other person's character.
[104:36.34]So still no sign of this prince.
[104:45.68]Don't know where the hell he is.
[104:50.24]Context being behind you wanting someone to piss in your face.
[104:56.13]No, his superpower was probably, like, P. I need to... Can I keep exploring down here?
[105:04.63]Find this prince.
[105:06.75]There's $100 in it for you.
[105:09.73]Okay, I'm gonna do... Can I do Farsight from here?
[105:15.17]No, I need one of those hands out of the ground.
[105:18.44]Halt!
[105:24.19]Where's, um... Quick parry is over here.
[105:27.89]Just hanging out.
[105:28.53]Alright, let's, uh... Somebody kill this troll, please.
[105:35.70]Uh, what do I need?
[105:38.62]What do I need?
[105:39.56]We don't need to kill him.
[105:41.36]He's gonna cause a problem.
[105:42.46]Extort that money.
[105:43.20]Alright, now I'm gonna do a, uh... What the hell?
[105:47.25]Fairgrounds.
[105:47.99]I'm just gonna put it over here.
[105:51.59]I don't even know what it does.
[105:55.79]Set the agenda for royal tournaments by choosing magic, melee, archery, or combo.
[106:03.74]Heroes may purchase training to enhance their abilities.
[106:11.16]So it's just like a training ground.
[106:17.01]Can you do an impression of Elmo impersonating Seth Rogen, impersonating Beetlejuice, impersonating Tommy Wiseau making fun of Dan Aykroyd trying to sell you Crystal Skull vodka?
[106:29.66]What at home?
[106:30.66]What does it say again?
[106:31.28]I don't know what that means.
[106:41.85]I'm not going to do that.
[106:45.03]Anyways, let's go down here.
[106:46.51]Let's get a wizard or two.
[106:47.60]That's too much to think about.
[106:57.10]My brain stopped comprehending what you were saying after the word Seth Rogen.
[107:01.30]I don't know.
[107:06.25]Alright, where is this prince?
[107:08.23]I've explored everything.
[107:10.55]Alright, you know what?
[107:15.05]We're making it really worth people's while.
[107:16.74]Get over here.
[107:17.44]Let's go.
[107:19.88]1500 bucks.
[107:20.32]Who's on their way?
[107:23.32]Where's Quick Parry?
[107:25.20]Message.
[107:25.78]Oh, there it is.
[107:27.82]Where?
[107:28.32]Hold on.
[107:28.60]Did I skip 1500 bucks for no reason?
[107:35.67]There was a message flag.
[107:36.55]Wait, wait, wait.
[107:37.31]Where is this?
[107:37.69]Oh, there it is.
[107:40.43]Alright, release the prison.
[107:50.46]$2,000 to the person that can take this down.
[107:54.44]Quick Parry's just gonna do it by himself.
[108:02.55]Well, hold on.
[108:03.05]We got level 4.
[108:04.11]This guy's good.
[108:09.37]Quick Parry's gonna just take it all.
[108:15.19]Get in there.
[108:16.79]Save the Prince.
[108:19.37]Sick.
[108:21.41]He teleported behind the bear.
[108:24.91]That's some next level plays by NelsonQuickPerry.
[108:31.10]This is a victory rider.
[108:40.74]Do I have to bring him back?
[108:43.40]Here's the worst part about this.
[108:45.04]I could have finished this mission in, like, five minutes.
[108:48.22]If I had just gone down over here.
[108:50.50]It's right next to the town.
[108:52.50]I went in a full horseshoe around.
[108:56.74]That's kind of bullshit, but whatever.
[109:00.58]Okay.
[109:11.33]The obelisk was a hint, too?
[109:14.19]Was it?
[109:14.55]I kept seeing it.
[109:16.45]Turn back.
[109:17.29]Oh, it was one of those stupid... This is the evil lair.
[109:23.88]Turn back.
[109:24.56]Don't come into the evil lair.
[109:27.36]Promise nothing bad over here.
[109:28.90]It was one of those scenarios.
[109:30.04]Alright, we saved the prince.
[109:30.82]The prince is a rat?
[109:31.84]We saved the rat prince.
[109:43.13]Majesty, your heroes have returned the Prince of Valmorgan to his kingdom.
[109:48.28]A caravan from the Queen of Valmorgan now waits at our gates.
[109:53.00]The treasures it carries are most glorious to behold.
[109:56.22]But more important is this brief note from the Queen herself.
[109:59.90]She writes, My thanks for the recovery of my son goes beyond any material reward I could offer.
[110:06.53]Your compassionate leadership is an inspiration to all of Ardenia.
[110:11.16]That was pitch shifted.
[110:12.84]It had, it was.
[110:16.64]Clip that and just listen to that again.
[110:18.30]That last three or four sentences were a little higher.
[110:24.30]Strange.
[110:27.90]Getting better.
[110:28.36]The last time I had 47 recruited heroes and 42 of them died.
[110:35.53]Now I've been much more focused.
[110:43.95]Standing buildings.
[110:44.95]Gold balance.
[110:45.73]Okay.
[110:46.11]Alright.
[110:49.79]Quick carried.
[110:55.03]Let's see.
[110:55.53]Yeah, Senator Jeremy's fine.
[110:57.07]Nice!
[110:57.68]Now try another quest.
[110:58.56]Advanced if you haven't yet.
[110:59.68]Don't tell me to do that.
[111:03.32]Oh, I'm not ready for advanced.
[111:04.38]I still don't even know what I have the buildings do.
[111:09.72]Do it.
[111:10.06]No.
[111:10.22]No.
[111:14.09]Look at this one.
[111:14.69]Expert.
[111:15.11]This one's beginner.
[111:19.28]Valley of the Serpents.
[111:20.68]Vengeance of the Lich Queen.
[111:26.34]Put a bounty on Quick Parry so everyone has to attack him and he solos everybody.
[111:32.10]Put like a $50,000 bounty.
[111:37.14]Okay.
[111:37.98]Oh, the Dark Forest.
[111:40.28]The Wizard's Curse.
[111:41.26]Now that sounds really boring.
[111:43.68]Quest for the Crown?
[111:51.68]Quest for the Crown.
[111:54.54]I'm not ready for this.
[112:04.28]Not ready.
[112:05.67]I'll try it.
[112:06.15]I'm not ready, though.
[112:10.75]An enlightening discovery, Your Highness.
[112:12.69]The Crown of Sidrian, the long-lost symbol of your family's power, has been located.
[112:17.95]It's being held in an evil fortress on the frontier.
[112:21.51]The recent waves of monster attacks have left your people dispirited.
[112:25.52]Reclaiming this item would doubtlessly boost your subjects' faith and renew the support of your family's house.
[112:32.32]I greatly urge you to take advantage of this unexpected opportunity.
[112:37.81]Okay.
[112:38.39]So, we have to go get the crown.
[112:41.81]Find and destroy the lair that the crown rests in.
[112:44.17]Pretty simple... Pretty simple... thing to do.
[112:49.44]Okay.
[112:51.94]Let's go.
[112:52.36]Let's go.
[112:52.66]No fucking around.
[112:53.76]Right off the bat, get a ranger out there.
[112:55.70]Were there any stipulations?
[113:01.55]In the name of the sovereign...
[113:05.58]Mark it.
[113:05.98]Immediately.
[113:07.26]Blacksmith.
[113:07.97]Immediately.
[113:08.71]Level 2 weapons.
[113:09.59]Immediately.
[113:11.27]Wizard.
[113:11.57]Immediately.
[113:12.53]Rogue's Guild.
[113:13.05]Immediately.
[113:14.47]Warrior's Guild.
[113:15.09]Immediately.
[113:19.47]Hurry up.
[113:19.87]More.
[113:20.40]Get him out there quick.
[113:21.18]Now.
[113:21.98]Okay.
[113:22.30]This is already... I'm already dead.
[113:25.20]Oh my god.
[113:25.88]Oh my god.
[113:26.54]I didn't know they were going to be here right now.
[113:33.02]They're already... is this possible?
[113:34.22]This is impossible.
[113:35.12]I didn't even get 30 seconds.
[113:53.19]What the fuck are you supposed to do about this?
[113:55.71]How are you supposed to beat this?
[113:56.85]Um...
[114:34.70]What happened over here?
[114:37.98]Who sprinted?
[114:38.98]Somebody was like, I gotta get away from the town.
[114:42.30]I think it's left or right.
[114:43.34]I don't remember where I'm lost in the forest.
[114:45.26]I think it's the left here.
[114:46.76]Ah, shit.
[114:47.28]I'm back in town.
[114:51.53]I just lose.
[114:52.17]This is interesting.
[114:53.25]How do you do this?
[115:01.37]It's not over yet.
[115:02.07]I'm good!
[115:20.44]Let's go.
[115:23.14]Rebuild.
[115:25.11]Rebuild everything.
[115:26.59]What do I need to rebuild?
[115:27.61]They killed everything.
[115:28.59]I don't have any money.
[115:34.35]I used every cent.
[115:36.41]Where's the tax collector?
[115:37.33]Oh, shit.
[115:38.79]Here comes another one.
[115:53.20]Okay.
[115:54.04]There's no way.
[115:55.77]It's too hard.
[115:56.49]An inn?
[115:57.37]The royal treasury is empty.
[115:59.99]They just keep coming.
[116:15.17]I don't think I'm going to be able to do this.
[116:16.33]I'm going to have to restart it.
[116:19.59]You don't have any heroes.
[116:20.80]Oh, fuck.
[116:21.48]I don't have any money.
[116:25.40]They killed everything.
[116:27.32]Alright, redo.
[116:28.22]Redo, redo.
[116:28.52]I have to immediately just start melting everybody.
[116:31.34]No, restart.
[116:32.04]Here we go.
[116:45.18]Right off the bat.
[116:46.22]Bingo.
[116:49.14]Wizards Guild right now.
[116:49.88]Quick.
[116:52.26]Another one.
[116:56.44]Hurry up.
[116:56.84]Go.
[116:59.36]Because I'm going to be like... Oh.
[117:01.48]No, no, no, no, no.
[117:02.20]Shit.
[117:09.25]What do I need to do?
[117:09.71]Immediately.
[117:10.51]Okay.
[117:11.01]Heroes.
[117:12.09]Heroes.
[117:21.39]And then zap the fuck out of everybody.
[117:29.27]Anybody that comes over here, just... Who's left?
[117:31.43]Anybody else?
[117:49.93]Okay, we're coming from the bottom too, right?
[117:51.61]More.
[117:51.75]Again?
[117:52.13]I feel revitalized.
[117:54.35]All right, I've given him more money.
[117:58.38]Okay.
[118:20.91]Fuck.
[118:23.57]I don't have any more money!
[118:29.17]Oh my god!
[118:30.15]I'm out of money.
[118:34.84]I don't have any more fucking money.
[118:44.54]How the hell are you supposed to do this?
[118:46.10]There's like 30 minotaurs that come up here.
[118:51.86]I don't even have money to do this.
[118:59.36]It's over.
[119:01.42]Get out there.
[119:02.26]It might not be completely over.
[119:06.48]Hold on.
[119:10.10]Just raise taxes.
[119:11.04]Actually, this is not... If these guys level up down here... Call to arms.
[119:17.13]Come on.
[119:17.47]Get everybody back here.
[119:18.41]Right here.
[119:20.33]If they can level up, if I can take this for a minute... Where's my tax collector?
[119:28.76]That's okay.
[119:32.94]Level 4?
[119:33.56]That's not terrible.
[119:36.10]Alright, hold on.
[119:39.96]I need to build a... Where's the blacksmith?
[119:44.85]Level 3 armor.
[119:46.41]Level 3 weapons.
[119:48.37]And hopefully the warriors can carry it.
[119:51.28]Where the hell did they go?
[119:55.28]They're all in the inn, just sitting there.
[119:56.60]Get out of the inn!
[120:01.46]Inn, I need a... No, I need an inn.
[120:03.97]No, I don't.
[120:04.29]What do I need?
[120:05.01]A guardhouse?
[120:05.85]That's not going to do anything.
[120:08.19]What is that?
[120:09.27]What is that, and why is it here?
[120:11.77]Are they going to be able to kill this?
[120:19.35]No way, man.
[120:26.51]No way.
[120:28.29]You get that.
[120:31.72]This is too quick, too fast, too happening.
[120:34.82]It happened way too quickly.
[120:36.44]How are you supposed to keep up with this and not lose all your money?
[120:40.86]New building.
[120:48.80]You just get overwhelmed.
[120:53.59]And you have money, but... I wonder... I feel like this is like a puzzle level.
[121:00.73]Where you just need to do something in a very specific order.
[121:03.22]Alright, we're not doing this one.
[121:17.76]Let's go to... How the hell are you supposed to do that?
[121:24.95]Uh... Free the slaves.
[121:26.73]Quest for the magic ring.
[121:28.79]A deal with the demon.
[121:31.37]Wizard's Curse?
[121:33.83]Oh, that's beginner.
[121:39.54]Yeah, we're doing the wizard's curse.
[121:40.94]I'm not going to skip.
[121:41.88]I humbly beg for your forgiveness for this rude intrusion.
[121:44.47]But there's an angry wizard who... Move aside, you sniveling toad.
[121:48.71]Sovereign, I will have words with you.
[121:51.95]Under your lawless rule, one of your foolish subjects has stolen my book of spells.
[121:58.56]The value of that great tome is beyond measure.
[122:01.90]You and your realm must now pay a price for its loss.
[122:06.38]Are we going to have a permanent debuff?
[122:08.38]Okay, hold on.
[122:22.64]There are two different ways to rid the curse.
[122:24.70]Method one, arrest the hooligan who stole the book of spells, return it to the wizard, and then perform whatever the wizard deems sufficient good deeds.
[122:34.22]Method two, destroy the angry wizard.
[122:38.93]Your heroes are cursed, so they won't act like their regular selves.
[122:43.99]Wizards' guilds and temples aren't available in this game.
[122:49.45]Arrest the hooligan who stole the book.
[122:54.46]Okay.
[122:57.38]Who stole the book?
[123:00.22]In order to guide your kingdom to prosperity and shed the wizard's curse, you have two options.
[123:04.77]Either find the idiot hooligan who stole the book and then perform what the wizard refers to as good deeds, or confront the wizard and destroy him.
[123:14.01]Send all... Send heroes to arrest all of the realm's hooligans so they can be detained and searched at the palace.
[123:27.57]What?
[123:30.16]Okay, well, we need... We need a marketplace.
[123:41.96]We need... How much money do I have?
[123:45.87]13,000?
[123:45.95]We need a... How do I, um... How do I question?
[123:52.25]Not question, um...
[123:57.59]Let's do... Let's do Warrior's Guild.
[124:05.29]Warrior's Guild, Ranger's Guild.
[124:07.45]Right next to each other here.
[124:09.83]Where are the hooligans?
[124:13.33]Actually, I want two Ranger's Guilds.
[124:15.17]I want a bunch of Rangers.
[124:19.07]In due time, apparently.
[124:19.99]Alright, so... Healing potions are important, right off the bat.
[124:29.45]Let's go with a inn as well.
[124:31.93]Over here somewhere.
[124:34.11]How do you detain somebody?
[124:36.71]The hero's will.
[124:37.43]Oh, okay.
[124:58.76]Okay, ranger skill.
[124:59.52]Let's get a bunch of rangers.
[125:01.90]I know.
[125:02.18]That's what I'm doing.
[125:03.60]There's the tax collector.
[125:05.24]All right.
[125:05.62]Go find some thieves.
[125:06.52]Explore.
[125:29.45]Let's also put an N up.
[125:34.17]I'm actually going to have you on camera one.
[125:38.67]And you on camera two.
[125:42.17]What's wrong with them?
[125:44.28]Oh, right.
[125:44.62]They're like idiots, right?
[125:45.50]They're stupid, right?
[125:46.76]There's something wrong with them?
[125:52.16]Yeah, they don't listen to me.
[125:52.92]They just, like, kind of walk around in circles.
[125:54.16]Alright, let's get a blacksmith.
[125:57.54]Over here, I guess.
[125:59.98]Ruined keep.
[126:00.34]Demon wood?
[126:00.60]150 gold in there.
[126:01.10]Uh-oh.
[126:18.01]Uh-oh.
[126:20.17]That guy looks pretty dangerous.
[126:22.12]I need some guardhouses.
[126:25.02]How you doing?
[126:30.80]Can he not see you?
[126:32.62]I want another one down here, too.
[126:37.47]Don't do anything stupid.
[126:38.29]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[126:39.61]Don't do that.
[126:45.93]What do the gnomes do?
[126:47.89]I haven't figured that out yet.
[126:48.69]Let's see.
[126:50.93]Recruits gnomes.
[126:51.85]Additional gnome hovels are automatically built as you recruit gnomes.
[126:55.59]Destroyed hovels will be rebuilt automatically.
[126:59.83]So they just keep going all over the place?
[127:03.85]That's cool.
[127:06.66]They just help build stuff.
[127:07.58]That's cool.
[127:09.89]Alright, let's get another couple warriors in here.
[127:14.43]Where's that blacksmith?
[127:15.67]I need to get better weapons.
[127:19.71]They're super fast.
[127:24.16]That's cool.
[127:26.08]Anybody level more than level 1?
[127:29.32]Finish building this.
[127:30.00]What are you doing?
[127:32.84]I feel revitalized.
[127:36.46]I don't even know what's happening over here.
[127:37.74]There's more of this shit over here.
[127:42.38]Alright, um...
[127:48.05]Your Majesty, a new building is complete.
[127:51.30]Quickly, come on.
[127:56.60]Finish the blacksmith.
[127:57.50]Where are these peasants?
[127:59.06]What are they doing?
[127:59.54]Your Majesty, a new building is complete.
[128:02.27]Your Highness, we've improved the guardhouse.
[128:05.27]Your Highness, we've improved the guardhouse.
[128:08.23]Your Majesty, a new building is complete.
[128:11.79]Alright, sewer's here now.
[128:13.67]That's not great.
[128:14.53]That's not good.
[128:15.23]Nice.
[128:15.53]Alright, level four.
[128:16.47]Not bad.
[128:16.79]Don't die.
[128:17.23]Don't get yourself killed.
[128:18.49]Ranger.
[128:18.69]Okay.
[128:18.83]Now I need that blacksmith.
[128:19.63]Let's go.
[128:39.27]Perfect game for German.
[128:40.61]No micromanagement at all.
[128:42.59]You just let people do whatever they want to do.
[128:45.21]It's actually pretty fun.
[128:46.37]Keep it up.
[129:02.72]If they just stop running to randomly play... Come on.
[129:06.54]You're only level 4.
[129:07.16]Do you have any potions or anything?
[129:09.04]Nothing.
[129:09.40]So don't go up here.
[129:11.66]Smart.
[129:14.74]Thank God.
[129:15.65]You're not an idiot.
[129:18.75]This map is pretty small.
[129:23.13]Alright, so let me build... I have an inn, right?
[129:30.29]I don't have an inn.
[129:34.88]Who died?
[129:35.26]Somebody's dead?
[129:42.18]Who died?
[129:46.74]Tax collector?
[129:47.88]All right.
[129:49.40]This guy's got to go.
[129:50.04]He's down here too far.
[129:52.78]Somebody kill him.
[129:57.64]Friendly lodge up here.
[129:59.01]Oh no, that's too tough for me.
[130:04.18]At least you're smart enough to know that.
[130:05.77]We gotta get rid of this thing.
[130:09.17]No, the level 1 is gonna go and fight it.
[130:13.27]No.
[130:13.59]He's just sitting outside the door, staring at us.
[130:21.71]Ooh, get these tre- Alright, there's a hooligan right there.
[130:27.34]Go get him!
[130:30.60]Open these treasure boxes!
[130:33.46]Guess that's the guy right there.
[130:37.20]Collect him.
[130:38.42]There he is.
[130:39.32]One of your heroes has arrested a hooligan.
[130:40.84]Maybe this is the subject who stole the book.
[130:42.31]He's on his way to your palace to be interrogated.
[130:45.61]Nice.
[130:49.81]Hopefully he doesn't get hit by a rock.
[130:51.41]We're good, right?
[130:54.55]Is it him?
[130:54.95]I want to keep my eye on him.
[131:04.75]What's going on over here?
[131:10.04]He's being leeched of levels by what?
[131:15.12]Okay, in the palace.
[131:16.40]Who's in there?
[131:18.42]What is that ring ding?
[131:21.06]Was it him?
[131:36.29]Oh, what?
[131:37.57]Another person arrested.
[131:41.45]Get him in there.
[131:41.91]So this is the second person we've arrested.
[131:48.27]Who is the one?
[131:48.96]Who's the illegal guy?
[131:50.16]Alright.
[131:52.94]Let me focus on this again.
[131:53.94]Go to the blacksmith.
[132:00.12]Get level 3 weapons.
[132:05.08]Message.
[132:05.40]Another one.
[132:07.88]Arrested another person over here.
[132:11.21]They're all on this side.
[132:13.57]Explore over here.
[132:15.53]They seem to all be, like, hanging out over here.
[132:17.21]Nope.
[132:29.16]How we doing on this?
[132:29.94]Good.
[132:31.38]That's not good.
[132:32.40]That's pretty bad, actually.
[132:33.45]Get rid of that now.
[132:34.39]That's a scary enemy.
[132:36.77]700 bucks.
[132:37.11]Kill it.
[132:38.09]New services.
[132:45.64]You have arrested every hooligan in the land except one.
[132:48.12]The other hooligans have confessed to his whereabouts.
[132:51.20]Unfortunately, he has learned some spells from the spellbook and is not likely to return it without a fight.
[133:01.16]Where is he?
[133:02.48]Is this him?
[133:05.80]Is he level 10?
[133:08.21]Wait, he's just like coming up to the city.
[133:11.63]Kill him.
[133:14.79]What is he dropping?
[133:15.67]He's dropping like a nuke on us.
[133:21.05]Oh my god.
[133:21.87]A thousand dollars to the man that killed him.
[133:27.42]Do I have anybody that's like level 5 or 10?
[133:28.44]Alright, here we go.
[133:32.32]1100 bucks, kill him!
[133:37.44]Oh no, and a rat just came out.
[133:38.76]Does everybody get on him?
[133:39.86]Level 4, level 4, level 4.
[133:45.51]Why would you not attack the guy that's over here?
[133:48.23]Get him!
[133:50.41]Get him!
[133:52.19]Kill him!
[133:58.74]He's learned a few spells.
[134:02.29]Got it!
[134:02.75]Get the book!
[134:04.91]There it is.
[134:09.15]Now what?
[134:11.33]Now what do we do?
[134:12.59]What's going on?
[134:15.97]Uh... I'm confused.
[134:21.74]Do we have to return the book?
[134:24.50]Wooden sign.
[134:30.39]Peasant?
[134:30.95]What's a peasant doing over here?
[134:32.21]Alright, get rid of this.
[134:43.32]Fancy iron sign, okay.
[134:47.02]How do I give him the book?
[134:53.57]That's a trader peasant.
[134:54.73]What do you mean, trader peasant?
[135:05.15]Is that a trader?
[135:05.85]I don't have enough money.
[135:13.94]I need more, like... I need a trading post, right?
[135:18.24]I wonder if I can... No, no, no.
[135:19.80]Don't attack it.
[135:23.76]Now that you have recovered his spellbook, the wizard who cursed your kingdom demands that you perform adequate good deeds in order to atone for your citizens' blunders.
[135:30.72]There is a peasant who has been taken captive by a few crazed werewolves.
[135:35.18]Free her and dispel the curse for good.
[135:37.54]Call in the reinforcements!
[135:41.68]That's her right there.
[135:42.50]He's almost dead.
[135:45.52]Level 7?
[135:48.10]How do I free her?
[135:49.94]I serve with pleasure.
[135:54.69]Call to arms.
[135:55.69]Get everybody in now.
[135:59.79]How do we save her?
[136:07.38]What do we do about this?
[136:11.67]She's just walking around town.
[136:16.62]An unwelcome guest.
[136:19.20]Kill the werewolves, baby.
[136:20.65]All right, well, don't.
[136:21.21]Nobody kill her.
[136:22.71]All right, here we go.
[136:28.27]Werewolves.
[136:29.77]We're not ready for this yet.
[136:30.75]I need some more level heroes.
[136:34.47]You're the only one that's worth anything right now.
[136:38.51]You just keep exploring.
[136:39.35]I'm going to destroy some of this shit over here.
[136:41.61]Where's the... Where the fuck is the...
[136:46.58]We gotta wipe out some of this trash down here, yeah.
[136:49.55]Ruin shrine.
[136:50.41]Get rid of this.
[136:54.63]Okay, I need some more... I need more warriors.
[136:57.43]I need some more rangers.
[136:58.67]Maybe some rogues.
[137:01.19]Let's get rid of this creature den, too.
[137:07.18]Level 4 armor.
[137:10.14]Did that first level 4 weapons.
[137:14.72]You're gonna take that on yourself?
[137:15.90]Okay, good.
[137:19.08]How many werewolves are there?
[137:20.00]There's probably like... Looks like four or five.
[137:22.14]You're not doing too bad.
[137:29.93]Somebody died.
[137:32.97]Um... Palace is really expensive.
[137:36.23]All right.
[137:40.55]Level four weapons and armor are available.
[137:45.10]I didn't even... I'm just gonna recruit like five, ten gnomes.
[137:50.29]Just bring him out here.
[137:53.41]Uh-oh.
[138:01.96]House is full.
[138:02.54]House is full.
[138:05.62]Those things aren't as dangerous as I think.
[138:07.00]I keep thinking they are.
[138:11.78]Level seven.
[138:12.32]This guy's just been farming this building and leveled up like three times.
[138:18.89]Alright.
[138:20.21]Marketplace down here.
[138:23.47]Trading post?
[138:24.03]I don't know.
[138:24.33]I need a trading post.
[138:30.33]Trading post needs to be close, right?
[138:33.27]Let me look at this one more time.
[138:40.58]Heroes may purchase healing potions.
[138:42.00]Caravans periodically depart from your trading post, bringing gold to your marketplace.
[138:45.74]I wasn't trying to hurt you!
[138:48.33]The more further away, the more gold it makes, so... So, like, if I put it all the way down here, then it'll be a lot of money.
[138:57.25]So you want your marketplaces to be close, but you want your trading posts to be far away.
[139:02.47]Well, level 9, get back.
[139:03.83]Don't kill yourself here.
[139:05.23]Don't let get killed.
[139:08.67]Teleport back to town.
[139:09.61]Alright.
[139:15.12]Take this out.
[139:15.68]200 bucks.
[139:16.30]Alright.
[139:16.71]Hmm.
[139:16.87]Always upgrade your marketplace level 3 as soon as possible.
[139:20.59]Just tech.
[139:22.19]Yeah.
[139:24.05]That's true.
[139:24.89]Alright, trading post is here.
[139:43.38]Another one of these gnome hobbits.
[139:49.72]The gnomes are actually kind of cool because they just... They kind of just run around aimlessly in random places and help.
[139:55.81]So, that's cool.
[139:56.47]I'm going to keep as many of them as I can.
[139:57.63]100 bucks for the kills.
[140:01.73]Alright, I think it's time to go and kill the werewolves.
[140:05.51]Who's in there now?
[140:11.97]Alright.
[140:14.00]They're going to kill this.
[140:16.34]Oh, shit.
[140:17.68]My level 7 died here.
[140:22.38]Why would you aggro the tree?
[140:24.91]Just kill this.
[140:26.45]Don't kill her.
[140:27.01]I need to... 1900.
[140:28.25]I need to get this to level 3.
[140:30.99]They're doing all right.
[140:45.61]After this, I'll have a couple of level 9s.
[140:49.69]You idiot.
[140:52.69]I knew that was going to happen.
[140:53.49]I knew that was going to happen.
[140:56.45]I just knew it.
[140:57.11]Alright.
[140:57.67]Now... Here we go.
[140:58.75]300 for you.
[140:59.27]300, 400 for you.
[140:59.83]400 for you.
[141:17.71]Go for it.
[141:20.66]Take out the werewolves.
[141:23.94]Do not attack this building.
[141:25.80]That would be a very big mistake.
[141:28.68]Heroes can be resurrected if you build a mausoleum.
[141:32.59]Really, that's cool.
[141:37.03]Ratmen, get out of here.
[141:38.05]I mean, that was a lot of money, but I haven't been able to do that the whole game.
[141:47.32]Oh, shit.
[141:51.26]Too much confidence.
[141:52.78]Too much confidence.
[141:53.65]How many healing potions?
[141:54.49]No more healing potions.
[141:56.45]Why did you do this?
[141:58.59]Level 10 is about to die.
[142:00.79]Oh, man.
[142:02.65]Get out.
[142:03.75]Don't be an idiot.
[142:05.15]Don't be an idiot.
[142:07.73]I did it.
[142:08.49]I did it.
[142:18.93]Majesty, the curse of stupidity has been lifted from our people.
[142:23.27]Our land is... Good said, Drevin.
[142:25.49]Let's ride the catapult one more time.
[142:28.35]Please!
[142:30.09]Ah, the curse is starting to lift, and most people have regained their intellect.
[142:36.84]Once we pluck all the palace guards from the surrounding trees and wheel the siege weapons back in storage, all should be well.
[142:49.47]That was a pretty good Disney goofy thing.
[142:53.19]Alright, cool.
[142:59.95]My liege, it's good to see you again.
[143:03.15]As you're well aware, Ardania's heartlands have flourished under your steady rule.
[143:08.83]Indeed, your leadership has ushered in a new era of prosperity.
[143:14.43]However, the untamed frontier of the northern reaches remains a haven for chaotic forces that still threaten our fair land.
[143:23.43]It is my counsel that you begin a northern expansion to quell these agents of turmoil.
[143:29.51]While this adventure presents great challenges, it offers even greater rewards.
[143:35.40]I'll now take my leave, Majesty, so that you may consider this undertaking and decide where to begin.
[143:41.54]So here's something that I don't really understand.
[143:47.90]So am I getting something for doing this?
[143:51.38]The rewards will be...
[143:58.40]Or is it just missions?
[143:59.92]Because... Is there a reason to do anything?
[144:02.80]It's just the campaign.
[144:04.20]Okay.
[144:06.49]Well.
[144:07.85]Let's try another advanced one.
[144:11.13]Hold off the goblin hordes.
[144:12.77]I don't like those ones.
[144:15.03]Trade routes.
[144:16.75]Clash of empires.
[144:18.83]Legendary heroes.
[144:22.10]Rise of the ratmen.
[144:28.48]Sovereign, the Ratmen grow bolder day by day.
[144:31.74]Their numbers appear to increase, and strange new sounds can be heard issuing from our sewers.
[144:37.03]Rumors have reached our ears of a new ruler among Ratkind.
[144:41.23]Erode it with a taste for surface conquest.
[144:44.99]We must be vigilant against a potential Ratmen invasion.
[144:49.09]If they choose to strike, we must target their new leader.
[144:52.84]Without their ruler, the Ratmen will not be able to maintain such an onslaught.
[144:58.56]Okay, so destroy Rodan, the Rat King, and all broken sewer mains in the realm.
[145:13.40]Now I get to be the giant rat.
[145:14.67]So we're gonna kill Rodan, the Rat King.
[145:19.67]Look at all these sewer entrances.
[145:22.53]What?
[145:22.77]There's a ratapult.
[145:24.81]Oh my god.
[145:28.57]level two level um elven bungalow oh I in the name of the sovereign I need some guard houses I think the elves join our prosperous kingdom I feel revitalized I serve with pleasure is it gazebo I don't know what any of this does but look at all these are sewers
[145:53.04]Gazebo.
[145:54.84]Heroes may rest here for a time.
[145:56.26]Okay.
[145:56.86]Fountain.
[145:59.10]An extra tax collector has been enlisted to your service.
[146:01.38]That's pretty good.
[146:02.06]And then, what was the other one?
[146:07.45]Elephant bungalow.
[146:08.71]Alright.
[146:08.97]I don't want to blow all my money here, though.
[146:24.69]Fill the sewers with lava.
[146:25.99]I could.
[146:29.55]These guys just... Get rid of it.
[146:34.83]I have so many buildings.
[146:37.53]How many buildings do I have?
[146:39.21]What the hell?
[146:39.69]Holy shit, there's a lot of stuff going on here.
[146:41.37]Uh...
[146:52.66]There's a sewer here.
[146:53.64]The sewer entrance is here.
[146:54.96]All right, this is what I wanted to design.
[147:00.10]This is why I did this.
[147:17.37]What is it?
[147:17.77]Elven... It recruits elves.
[147:21.71]Doubles the amount of gold generated by your marketplaces.
[147:25.13]An elven lounge will soon be built in any settlement containing an elven bungalow.
[147:30.21]Okay, that sounds pretty good.
[147:33.96]I need... What do I need to do here?
[147:37.44]Are the elves good?
[147:38.36]Yeah, I'm just gonna fill this place with elves.
[147:44.90]What's wrong with this person's voice?
[147:50.90]What?
[147:54.19]Are we taking this out?
[147:57.97]Get rid of this.
[147:58.43]This is like the sewer main.
[148:00.97]Okay, I need to do... What do we got here?
[148:03.33]Arrows, arrows, arrows.
[148:04.39]You, uh... I need to... Shit.
[148:10.44]There's so much going on.
[148:12.36]There's two... Okay, the rats just all came out.
[148:15.22]Is this the guy?
[148:15.82]What does the guy have to kill?
[148:17.96]Ratman Champion.
[148:20.85]Ratman Shaman.
[148:23.25]This is really bad.
[148:27.21]Very bad, very bad, very bad.
[148:28.81]Where are all my rangers?
[148:36.31]I need to make warriors.
[148:39.64]Magic, Bazaar, Marketplace, Mausoleum, Outpost, Ranger's Guild, Temp... Oh, there's a lot to look at here.
[148:45.60]Warrior's Guild.
[148:46.26]I'm dead.
[148:47.02]There's no way I'm going to do this.
[148:54.67]This is an expansion level?
[148:56.15]Because it makes sense that I don't know what the hell any of this stuff does.
[149:03.05]Elven Lounge.
[149:06.65]Majesty, the palace is under siege!
[149:09.44]I think I'm going to lose.
[149:11.02]Unless I can... What's going on over here?
[149:14.78]Vidvid is all over the place, huh?
[149:17.42]Probably shouldn't have had the bounty on that.
[149:19.29]But that's where they came from.
[149:20.31]Yeah, this is game over.
[149:23.13]This is game over.

[150:14.57]Healing potions.
[150:17.31]Where's the first spot they're going to come out of?
[150:19.17]Royal Gardens.
[150:19.97]What the fuck is this?
[150:21.29]Heroes may meditate in the Royal Gardens to gain a beneficial enhancement.
[150:23.93]Gold generated from increasing water to... Hurry up.

[152:13.77]I have a pretty decent army right now.
[152:20.61]I'm using all my money, but hopefully we can at least farm the guys coming out of the sewers here.
[152:26.13]That one's full.
[152:26.71]That one's full.
[152:27.63]Good.
[152:28.07]I now have an army.
[152:36.74]We got our tavern.
[152:38.38]Another one.
[152:41.02]Caravan.
[152:42.26]This is not good here.
[152:43.18]This is bad.
[152:47.26]I think I'm going to lose this time.
[152:54.71]Oh, Jesus.
[152:55.55]Okay.
[153:00.93]This is so bad.
[153:01.91]Is that him?
[153:05.07]Where's the guy?
[153:05.75]I already killed the guy.
[153:09.63]Yes, I'm sure they're very useful.
[153:11.27]We need healing potions.
[153:19.43]What about blacksmith?
[153:20.62]Level 3 weapons.
[153:23.86]Here they come, here they come, here they come.
[153:25.62]Um, I need... Uh...
[153:32.98]They're just going to slowly come down here.
[153:35.08]Tax collectors.
[153:36.96]We got people walking around in circles.
[153:41.90]Farm these guys.
[153:42.90]We're getting surrounded at all sides.
[153:45.00]Call to arms.
[153:45.56]Get everybody here.
[153:47.04]Go!
[153:58.83]Protect your kingdom!
[153:59.85]Protect your king!
[154:13.74]Did we do it?
[154:15.94]I think we did it.
[154:17.49]People are doing alright.
[154:20.55]Just keep leveling up.
[154:24.03]Chrom is the best temple.
[154:25.33]Level 4, level 4, 5, 5, 5.
[154:25.75]Keep leveling up.
[154:29.92]Where the fuck are you going?
[154:31.38]Why are you going up there?
[154:33.13]What are you... Are you stupid?
[154:34.15]Stay with the team!
[154:35.07]Alright, blacksmith.
[154:42.53]Good.
[154:42.95]Everyone's got a decent level right now.
[154:47.57]Four, four.
[154:48.23]As long as I... If I can get everybody to, like, four or five... Oh, shit.
[154:53.48]Here they come again.
[154:57.62]Good.
[154:58.10]What else do I need to do here?
[155:07.83]If they come... Forget about the bounties.
[155:11.23]They'll just do it on their own.
[155:14.39]How many warriors?
[155:15.04]I got... No warrior has died.
[155:20.72]Level 3, level 3.
[155:27.41]This is not... I held off that very first ridiculous wave.
[155:30.91]Now I'm going to do... Um... How much money do I have?
[155:34.07]Not a whole lot.
[155:35.15]Shit.
[155:35.35]What do I want to do?
[155:36.37]I serve with pleasure.
[155:48.74]They're just kind of going on their own now.
[155:51.98]Where's, like, another one of those rat cave... Oh, shit.
[155:53.86]Here they come.
[155:57.94]Your Majesty, the royal treasury is nearly empty.
[156:02.12]Your Highness, the dwarves are offering to move into our domain.
[156:08.62]Money?
[156:10.80]I don't know what the hell I need to do here.
[156:12.30]I have no money.
[156:13.32]Is there a trading post down here?
[156:16.26]There is.
[156:16.52]There already is one down here.
[156:23.56]Don't get overwhelmed.
[156:24.48]Fight together.
[156:26.55]Alright, they built up this one.
[156:34.69]This is still okay.
[156:35.71]I have all level 4 stuff.
[156:38.79]Call to arms!
[156:40.41]Call, call, call!
[156:41.59]Back, back, back!
[156:42.11]Everybody, let's go!
[156:44.74]I don't have enough to do the Chrom thing.
[156:46.46]Come on!
[156:54.54]Stay alive.
[156:56.30]Please stay alive.
[156:57.32]I can't do it.
[157:03.07]I don't have enough money.
[157:04.29]Are we losing people?
[157:09.19]We have not lost any knights.
[157:11.91]We haven't lost anybody.
[157:12.67]Everybody's still alive.
[157:14.87]Come on.
[157:17.03]Do it.
[157:21.15]And then I gotta go up here.
[157:23.19]And I'm gonna put a bounty on this.
[157:25.35]We have to start clearing all these rat holes.
[157:31.42]What do I need to put up, though?
[157:36.94]I don't have any fucking money.
[157:42.73]Tax collector.
[157:45.65]How much you got?
[157:47.67]Forty dollars.
[157:51.67]Like, a guard tower?
[157:52.49]I'm just trying to see, money-wise, I don't have very much.
[157:58.34]Alright.
[157:59.08]I gotta fucking get rid of these.
[158:02.12]$400 to get rid of that.
[158:02.78]Take out that rat hole.
[158:07.39]Kill this thing too, though.
[158:08.35]Don't just, like, leave the town completely abandoned.
[158:18.87]Somebody kill it.
[158:20.57]Somebody go up there and kill it.
[158:26.17]I don't know where they're going, but they're going over this way.
[158:33.86]This has to be killed.
[158:35.48]I gotta build some shit up here, but I don't have any fucking money.
[158:38.77]I did it all wrong.
[158:40.61]I'm gonna say a dwarven settlement.
[158:42.29]Just put it over here.
[158:49.14]How's everybody doing?
[158:51.46]Here they come.
[159:01.67]Another big rat recruitment.
[159:04.22]Well, they all have good weapons.
[159:05.78]They're all leveled up as high as they can.
[159:09.20]Do we need more mar... I still... I kind of don't understand how this works.
[159:16.32]I'm still trying to figure, because it's almost like, um, Rise of Nations.
[159:24.58]Are they actually gonna go up here?
[159:32.58]Marketplace level three.
[159:33.78]Oh, they're doing it!
[159:35.34]No, they're not.
[159:36.72]He's gonna die.
[159:46.07]Why are you the only one up here, man?
[159:48.71]How could you be the only person up here?
[159:52.08]And you're very strong, too.
[159:53.40]This is bad.
[159:56.24]Why would you go up there by yourself at level 4?
[160:00.60]Shit.
[160:01.49]No!
[160:02.77]No!
[160:03.43]Everybody come back!
[160:09.12]We gotta get rid of this shit!
[160:12.19]I need to make... a...
[160:28.44]I don't know.
[160:28.92]What would it be?
[160:29.72]Wizard's Guild?
[160:31.58]I'm gonna make it Wizard's Guild, I think.
[160:33.84]Guess I lost a couple people, I think.
[160:38.62]They're gonna level up!
[160:40.34]I don't know if they're gonna be able to pull this off.
[160:49.69]Come on, kill it!
[160:50.83]They're just pouring people over here, never-ending.
[160:57.77]You have to kill those little rat dens immediately.
[161:01.77]Like within 5 minutes of the game starting or you lose.
[161:03.77]I just don't know like the... all the tech trees to be able to go that fast.
[161:12.42]It's still possible.
[161:13.24]If I can level these guys up to like level 8, 9, 10.
[161:16.02]At least most of them.
[161:17.21]Or half of them even.
[161:20.89]Still have only 1300 bucks.
[161:22.17]The marketplace is gone.
[161:26.94]He did it!
[161:29.08]Alright, he did it.
[161:29.82]He got that one.
[161:30.46]I think there's only two more.
[161:33.96]Stay alive.
[161:34.66]Keep this alive.
[161:36.51]Please.
[161:42.13]You can do it.
[161:45.69]The critters are under attack.
[161:50.77]Okay, I need my marketplace back.
[161:57.61]Marketplace, marketplace, marketplace.
[161:59.17]That's literally all my fucking money.
[162:05.30]Oh, shit.
[162:08.66]No!
[162:11.56]There's the one down there and there's one up here somewhere, too.
[162:15.82]No damn money.
[162:17.32]Level 6.
[162:17.90]Alright, what do we got?
[162:23.72]What do we have?
[162:25.24]Level 7.
[162:26.99]We got a level 7.
[162:28.83]It's Sir Stahl.
[162:32.65]We just need one of these guys.
[162:33.79]Sir Stahl.
[162:34.47]Sir Stahl, where are you?
[162:36.39]You're just doing your own damn thing, aren't you?
[162:37.95]Get back down here.
[162:38.55]We need you.
[162:40.19]Very, very badly.
[162:47.44]Looks like they're making their way down here.
[162:49.80]Very good.
[162:50.92]Take this out.
[162:52.60]I don't have any money.
[162:58.96]A new wave is going to be coming here in a second.
[163:03.75]Whistlestall.
[163:07.63]What?
[163:07.97]Don't kill the Warrior's Guild.
[163:12.05]This is it?
[163:13.35]Alright.
[163:16.65]Take him out.
[163:17.13]Get rid of this rat cave.
[163:18.49]And then I should be alright.
[163:21.20]I might get a minute here.
[163:22.16]There we go.
[163:22.44]Take it out.
[163:22.80]Nice.
[163:23.22]Keep doing it.
[163:24.50]You guys can do it.
[163:27.96]Yes.
[163:28.04]Yes.
[163:47.46]I need an inn.
[163:50.10]They killed the inn.
[163:51.16]They also got rid of the dwarf thing that was over here.
[163:53.24]Alright, I need an inn for people to hang out and rest.
[163:55.91]I need to make money.
[164:01.65]Don't go all the way over here.
[164:02.83]Please, guys, what are you thinking?
[164:04.47]Don't do that.
[164:05.11]You're just gonna die.
[164:07.64]There's no reason for you to go over there.
[164:11.06]Level six, level four.
[164:12.18]I need you guys.
[164:15.66]Better marketplace.
[164:16.48]Good.
[164:18.75]Market day.
[164:20.07]There's nothing even in there.
[164:20.99]I haven't even explored half the map.
[164:27.09]No, I know.
[164:28.47]Are these two just gonna be like a team here and go take a bunch of shit out?
[164:37.98]So we're entrance.
[164:38.88]I think they're just gonna be on their own.
[164:39.98]Hopefully they stay together.
[164:42.00]What do we got?
[164:42.42]Level 7.
[164:42.86]Level 6.
[164:43.58]We have a couple level 7s now.
[164:46.16]All right, kill this thing, please.
[164:55.93]I need the marketplace down here.
[164:57.21]I'm forever penniless.
[165:08.37]I need an inn though.
[165:10.03]It's more important because I need an inn over here.
[165:16.01]Who said that?
[165:19.41]Oh my god.
[165:22.09]Oh my god.
[165:22.81]Oh my god.
[165:23.71]What did you guys do over here?
[165:24.61]What did you guys step on?
[165:27.07]Where is he?
[165:27.67]Where's Ratman?
[165:30.51]Oh my god.
[165:31.39]They're attacking from every angle.
[165:32.81]Where's the king?
[165:34.52]Where's King Rat?
[165:38.24]Did I hit the enrage timer?
[165:41.80]Where is he?
[165:48.78]Oh!
[165:50.25]Are they doing it?
[165:57.17]Please, stay alive.
[165:59.75]They're destroying the palace.
[166:01.13]Fantastic!
[166:02.77]The palace is under siege!
[166:04.79]Holy shit, man.
[166:05.91]This is hard.
[166:07.61]This is insane.
[166:08.92]I don't know where he is, but I think people are dying.
[166:10.98]Level 8.
[166:11.70]Where's Stahl?
[166:13.50]Stahl is in the middle right here.
[166:16.54]Come on.
[166:16.94]You can do it.
[166:17.26]He's got one.
[166:19.26]They're already at a 65 HP.
[166:20.72]Come on.
[166:26.54]Get everybody over here.
[166:27.20]Call to arms.
[166:27.70]It's over.
[166:28.54]I'm dead.
[166:33.84]Unless, like, actually Stahl does this on his own.
[166:41.55]What am I supposed to do about this?
[166:43.67]I hit the enrage timer.
[166:44.57]I had to have.
[166:50.64]Stahl dead?
[166:51.38]He's dead.
[166:58.82]Wow, this is really, really, really hard.
[167:04.38]Wow You gotta be bang bang bang bang bang bang bang Go faster.
[167:18.09]Yeah, I know, right?
[167:20.70]He's alive.
[167:21.82]This guy is.
[167:27.72]Your actions permitted or two, love.
[167:29.12]Well, I mean...
[167:36.06]Probably.
[167:43.32]These guys are still alive, though.
[167:47.76]This might not be a total loss because the palace is going to explode, but... Can these guys do it?
[167:53.25]Look, they're kind of melting this thing.
[167:56.43]I got a couple levels.
[167:57.03]I got a level 8 in here.
[168:00.23]What?
[168:00.79]Oh, of course.
[168:01.41]They came out of the store.
[168:02.03]Okay.
[168:05.86]Level 7?
[168:07.17]No, level 8's dead.
[168:08.67]I just don't have enough money.
[168:14.41]Shit.
[168:16.11]Oh, well.
[168:17.99]I'm kind of surviving.
[168:21.39]But I don't have enough money to supplement anybody here.
[168:25.23]And I don't want to build anybody.
[168:26.43]Because they're going to be level 1.
[168:31.39]I need an inn for them to go into.
[168:35.42]Somebody please build an inn.
[168:38.38]They're kind of doing it, but... It almost feels like for nothing.
[168:54.97]There's another broken sewer main over here.
[169:05.65]They're alive.
[169:08.45]They're alive.
[169:10.11]But they just never-endingly pour in.
[169:12.57]I need an inn.
[169:13.07]Please, build an inn for these guys to hang out in.
[169:19.19]Level 8, level 8, level 8, level 7.
[169:20.85]I think this is possible.
[169:38.76]They're all going to be leveled up.
[169:41.16]They all have the best armor.
[169:43.40]They have the best weapons.
[169:45.05]I just need potions.
[169:45.99]I need a marketplace so they can buy potions.
[169:49.15]Okay, the inn is done.
[169:51.63]Marketplace.
[169:52.17]1,400. 1,400.
[170:06.88]Come on!
[170:07.72]I lived.
[170:10.96]I actually lived.
[170:14.00]These guys are actually really, really high level now.
[170:18.44]Come on!
[170:19.20]Where's my money?
[170:20.02]I'm just getting free levels.
[170:37.08]You know what?
[170:37.38]I'm telling you, at this point, I think I gotta just go.
[170:40.62]I gotta just go take this band of people and have them explore up here and try to just kill the Rat King.
[170:48.60]I think that's the plan.
[170:53.14]That's the strategy.
[170:54.02]I got... One, two, three little eights.
[170:59.54]Maybe just let them hang around here and just gain...
[171:07.71]Is my blacksmith gone?
[171:09.73]Kind of.
[171:11.15]Alright, a thousand bucks.
[171:13.97]I wouldn't go all the way down there.
[171:15.35]If anything, go this way.
[171:23.24]I didn't know you guys were still alive.
[171:26.66]I still have these random explorers.
[171:28.68]No!
[171:29.34]Alright, I'm done.
[171:37.65]Instead of every single per- Let's go.
[171:39.51]Oh my god, I can't believe you just let this fucking happen.
[171:46.67]Let's go.
[171:52.00]Everybody up there now.
[171:52.90]Explore- Go!
[171:54.50]Forget it.
[171:54.88]A foul beast approaches.
[172:03.59]I have no... I just have no money.
[172:05.51]I can't do anything.
[172:06.27]I'm just constantly putting my fingers in holes that are spewing out on the side of the boat.
[172:15.02]Granny Nash is going up there.
[172:16.42]Good.
[172:16.54]Go up there, Grandma.
[172:31.69]Anybody else going up there?
[172:32.97]Besides one person.
[172:34.51]I would laugh my ass off if you just threw an axe at the guy's head.
[172:47.76]Only one person going for that bounty.
[172:51.04]The rest of you are just walking around in circles.
[172:53.06]Come on, Granny.
[172:59.74]Just find him.
[173:00.62]Level 7.
[173:00.88]What do you got for potions?
[173:04.60]Zero.
[173:10.78]I'm going to turn back down here and everyone's going to be level 10.
[173:17.14]Why is he the only person that cares about this?
[173:26.23]This is very, very concerning.
[173:38.82]nobody else cares and then he's gonna get lost up here and he's gonna die good work I don't have enough money to pay the bounty
[174:01.26]I know.
[174:01.64]Ho ho ho ho!
[174:02.94]Ho ho ho ho!
[174:04.68]Here's another!
[174:05.32]Ho ho ho ho!
[174:06.90]That's too many.
[174:09.12]Where is the king?
[174:10.84]Where's rat king?
[174:16.16]I think they're gonna do it though.
[174:17.66]I think they'll be okay.
[174:22.57]Are they?
[174:23.91]Who's still alive?
[174:24.97]Level 8, level 8, level 8.
[174:27.21]Level 7.
[174:27.97]They're alright!
[174:34.69]He's not even going for the bounty.
[174:42.79]Alright, find it!
[174:43.59]In the name of the sovereign!
[174:49.09]Get this thing out of here.
[174:50.03]Holy shit, they're literally everywhere now.
[174:57.74]Everyone's still fine?
[174:59.00]The palace is under siege!
[175:00.72]A foul beast approaches.
[175:05.43]Eight, eight, eight, seven, seven, seven.
[175:06.75]They're still alright?
[175:10.72]No fu- no, no, no, please just stay up here!
[175:16.84]Don't come all the way back to the castle!
[175:19.25]Somebody please!
[175:34.31]Level 8, level 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7.
[175:37.52]They're all still alive.
[175:54.05]Why won't you just go over here?
[175:55.57]What?
[175:55.87]You're gonna walk all the way back down because you want the bounty that is already down here that's being claimed by everybody that's already down here.
[176:05.96]There's a scroll?
[176:06.42]Where's the scroll?
[176:06.94]Wait, was he... Where is he?
[176:09.62]Where is he?
[176:10.04]Where the hell did he go?
[176:37.61]He's here?
[176:38.09]I don't see him.
[176:46.40]We got two level 9s.
[176:49.98]Every single sewer is a broken sewer main now.
[177:00.72]Destroy them all.
[177:02.14]Destroy all the broken sewer mains.
[177:07.81]I mean, I have a couple- I have some really strong units.
[177:13.67]I don't even know- Batman's Shaman?
[177:16.70]Oh fuck, a level 8's dead.
[177:18.20]This is bad.
[177:34.71]I think this is where it ends, unfortunately.
[177:36.39]I only have like five people here.
[177:43.03]Is he over here?
[177:51.73]Kill him.
[177:52.54]Kill him.
[177:52.80]He's right there.
[177:53.30]There he is.
[177:54.84]Somebody kill him.
[177:57.56]And then destroy all the...
[178:00.22]Is this walking around in circles?
[178:05.99]This sucks.
[178:07.41]It's over.
[178:08.81]Anybody gonna go get him?
[178:10.81]No?
[178:28.35]Tax collector number 31 is about to become tax collector number 32 Anybody going up there?
[178:38.84]No, he's just wandering around in circles At least we got to see him, right?
[178:48.32]We get to see the rat
[178:59.04]The day is lost, Majesty.
[179:00.92]But there's always tomorrow.
[179:08.05]Well, maybe it had something to do with the fact that at least 15 to 20 catapults just insta-spawn.
[179:20.19]Alright, that one's... We're not doing that one.
[179:25.35]Victory for the rats.
[179:28.86]Hold off the goblin horde.
[179:30.00]All the ones where there's a horde.
[179:32.12]Quest for the magic ring.
[179:33.46]That's the one I'm doing.
[179:34.70]Majesty, I fear my vision grows alarmingly dim.
[179:39.47]The dark plague which grips our land does not respect the boundaries of these castle walls.
[179:46.24]This epidemic sweeps through our land, leeching away the very life from your royal subjects.
[179:52.92]Okay.
[179:53.04]Okay.
[179:53.14]Recover the Ring of Healing.

[198:28.78]The phantoms have returned!
[198:37.96]I knew I shouldn't have done it.
[198:39.80]A hero has recovered the magic ring and with it, terrible curse.
[198:43.98]Suddenly you find yourself at war with the other kingdom in the realm.
[198:47.98]If the other kingdom manages to return the ring to their palace, the curse will not be broken and all will be lost.
[198:53.88]Also, you have incurred the wrath of the Black Phantoms.
[198:56.48]They will smite any hero who holds the ring.
[199:00.42]Right.
[199:02.92]I told you this was gonna happen.
[199:08.57]I shouldn't have fucking done that.
[199:09.69]A hero must return the magic ring to this pedestal in order to end the curse.
[199:16.29]Where's the ring?
[199:17.57]Who took the ring?
[199:18.83]Did anybody see where the ring went?

[201:22.45]Touchdown!
[201:22.87]Touchdown!
[201:23.27]Touchdown!
[201:23.69]Touchdown!
[201:24.11]Touchdown!
[201:24.53]Touchdown!
[201:24.87]Touchdown!
[201:26.25]We are victorious, your majesty!
[201:33.51]The ring has saved us all, Majesty.
[201:35.99]As your heroes carried the relic back into town, it was as if a deep winter snow had instantly lifted.
[201:42.40]The town literally sprang to life.
[201:45.84]Once again, your enlightened leadership has led us to safety.
[201:50.46]Cool.
[201:53.58]So that one was, I would say, 100 times easier than the rat one.
[202:00.14]And they were both advanced.

[205:38.52]Like, a little bit of it.
[205:39.92]While I was cupping the two strings.
[205:44.31]And just kind of squished it in with the paper towel.
[205:48.51]And rubbed and squished.
[205:51.27]And then kind of made sure it was completely and totally submerged in hand sanitizer.
[205:58.31]And then left alone.
[205:59.47]Let it just dry.
[206:03.35]That was it.
[206:09.89]Keep the drawstrings inside your pants.
[206:15.90]I was just wearing pants.
[206:17.50]It wasn't like... Put the drawstrings inside your underwear?
[206:21.65]Like, what do you mean?
[206:23.23]Like, stick them in your pants?
[206:34.23]Not only does that not work, it spreads the germs way worse.
[206:36.61]You may as well have cut them off if it bothered you.
[206:40.17]Yeah, but that was another thing.
[206:41.06]Where am I going to get a pair of scissors?
[206:42.12]In a public bathroom.
[206:43.70]At an airport.
[206:44.30]I already covered that.
[206:51.40]I'm just going to walk into a random store and ask for a pair of scissors.
[206:56.76]Can I borrow a pair of scissors, please?
[206:59.29]Uh... What?
[207:01.26]Okay, here.
[207:02.34]Thank you.
[207:02.68]And I just cut the ends off of my drawstrings, and then... Thanks.
[207:08.18]They're gonna be like, what the fuck did I just watch?
[207:26.10]Use your hands.
[207:27.45]I'm not going to put my hands all over.
[207:29.37]If it dips into the urinal, that's over.
[207:31.79]I don't know why the strings were so long in these pants.
[207:36.91]I want to see what an expert level looks like.
[207:40.31]Majesty, I'm here with the latest report from the chief tax collector.
[207:45.44]He reports that the fiscal quarter will soon be ending and the treasury reports a deficit of money.
[207:51.34]You dare interrupt?
[207:59.12]That was the burp.
[208:00.60]That was the burp.
[208:03.01]All right, listen, ready?
[208:04.49]That was what I did.
[208:05.31]He was like drinking a coffee and he was like... Majesty, I'm here with the latest report from the chief tax collector.

[208:46.30]Mighty leader, forgive this intrusion, but a terrible presence has visited our castle.
[208:51.66]A demon!
[208:52.64]He claims he's here to collect on a debt owed to him by your mother.
[208:56.86]Can this be true?
[208:57.87]Since we were unable.
[209:07.61]Why?
[209:08.11]Why?
[209:08.59]What's another one?
[209:11.09]Hold off the goblins.
[209:13.22]Dreadful news.

[217:06.33]Why is nobody killing this thing?
[217:08.75]What are you doing?
[217:10.81]Why is this just walking around like it's a citizen?
[217:12.65]I don't understand that.

[218:40.55]Trading post.
[218:47.86]Your Highness, the palace renovations are finished.
[218:51.18]Your Majesty, my royal treasury is nearly empty.
[218:54.97]What's going on here?
[218:56.57]This independent wizard's guild pledges to help defend the realm.
[218:58.99]Better yet, the local magi have enchanted it so that the building is invulnerable for a duration.
[219:05.27]Your allied wizard guild has lost its ward of invulnerability.
[219:07.84]It is mortal again and may be destroyed by those goblins.
[219:11.84]I've got to go down there and help.
[219:15.75]In order to further aid the cause, the allied wizards have deposited more gold into your inventory.
[219:20.45]Okay, thanks.
[219:23.53]I have to protect these guys, then.
[219:26.75]Alright, we've got to build down here.
[219:29.34]What the hell should I put down here?
[219:31.36]How about a... Temple of... Crom.
[219:36.56]What's another good one?
[219:38.84]Lenord?
[219:40.14]Temple of Lenord.
[219:45.56]Alright, how we all doing?

[220:01.94]Actually, you know what?
[220:02.82]No, do attack that.
[220:04.95]Get rid of that shit.
[220:05.67]It's like running the edge.
[220:11.78]Your Majesty, a new building is complete.
[220:14.34]Where's my blacksmith?
[220:15.24]Do I even have a blacksmith?

[229:52.72]Really?
[230:00.79]You'll get it.
[230:01.09]You'll get it.
[230:01.63]I need to upgrade this tower.
[230:03.05]I need some wizards.
[230:03.79]Alright, we've stopped that invasion.
[230:06.43]Good.
[230:07.01]Everybody relax for a minute.
[230:08.36]What happened to my...
[230:31.22]Where's my, uh, my, um, I don't even, I can't tell you what I'm trying to find.
[230:39.59]My, I don't know.
[230:41.15]I don't know what it is.
[230:41.79]Where's my, um.
[230:47.97]Alright, you got it.
[230:49.73]Check.
[230:50.05]I don't know.
[230:52.10]There's a cave thing over here.
[230:53.88]Get it!
[230:54.18]Find it and destroy it.
[231:12.48]Let's do some more warriors.
[231:17.84]More warriors.
[231:18.54]More.
[231:18.92]We got Goblin Hover.
[231:22.58]We'll kill it.
[231:23.36]Destroy.
[231:23.80]There's a big one.
[231:26.89]Destroy it. 500.
[231:43.29]We're good.
[231:46.09]It amuses me that nobody but one person in the chat know what's going on.
[231:54.39]I feel like a special boomer.
[231:59.94]Here we go.
[232:01.94]I think I've almost completed it.
[232:15.91]That is funny.
[232:16.77]Alright.
[232:17.43]Oh, up here.
[232:18.03]They're still coming from over here.
[232:25.31]Nobody's explored up there yet.
[232:29.80]Keep going over here.
[232:34.88]More gold.
[232:38.72]Ugh.
[232:40.49]Oh, there's too many cold arms.
[232:41.73]No.
[232:42.03]Yeah.
[232:42.21]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[232:44.57]Uh-huh.
[232:47.77]Way too many Somebody, people are dying I don't even have a library Windstorm
[233:17.22]He's dead.
[233:19.16]Got him.
[233:20.60]He's gone.
[233:20.98]This is where they're all coming from.
[233:26.26]Kill it.
[233:30.68]There's way too many of these things.
[233:43.55]Well, you guys are on your own.
[233:44.77]You know what?
[233:45.17]Like, what the fuck do I care?
[233:48.07]Actually, I do care.
[233:49.53]I can't just let my ally die like that.
[233:50.97]That'd be so mean.
[233:51.95]I kinda, like, can't listen to this anymore.
[234:09.47]tax collector this will be a quick minute goal this will be a quick bit of a tax collector your highness our research in the library is complete
[234:21.60]Your Highness, our research is complete.
[234:24.20]This will be a quick bit of gold.
[234:26.62]It reminds me of, you know those old kind of thought experiments, not thought experiments, when you were like 15 years old.
[234:33.70]No, younger than that.
[234:34.56]When you were like 10.
[234:36.30]And there was like a trail of sentence that you had to connect over and over again.
[234:43.41]One of them was like, there is a...
[234:45.71]There's a frog in the bottom of the sea, or the frog in the bottom of the lake, or whatever.
[234:49.69]There's a... No, no, there's a hole in the bottom of the... What's it called?
[234:53.51]There's a log on the frog in the bottom of the hole, or something.
[234:57.43]I'm trying to figure it out.
[234:59.24]I gotta take my headphones out.
[235:00.30]I can't.
[235:00.58]I'm getting speech jammed.
[235:03.42]There's... There's a... No, no, no.
[235:06.40]It was... There's a hole.
[235:08.42]There's, like, a flea on the hair on the dog in the frog in the log in the bottom of... Yeah.
[235:12.44]I won!
[235:12.86]I won!
[235:24.27]Anyways, there's like a hare on the flea, on the dog, on the log, on the frog, on the bog, on the log, at the bottom of the sea.
[235:31.57]You keep adding more and more things that you have to remember.
[235:33.76]That's what this is.
[235:38.54]This is a lot of noise in my ear.
[235:50.85]The day is yours, Majesty!
[235:52.39]The day is yours, Majesty!
[235:53.92]There's a flea on the hair of the log of the dog of the log of the bottom of the sea!
[235:58.20]While many lives were lost, our kingdom is safe once again.
[236:02.38]The Goblin King will think twice before trying another such futile assault.
[236:07.04]That was advanced.
[236:20.35]Hmm.
[236:21.55]Where do I want to go now?
[236:27.88]The demon mo- Oh, he said he's gonna- Yeah, where is it?
[236:32.28]A deal with a demon.
[236:33.43]But wait, yeah, okay.
[236:35.05]Mighty leader, forgive this intrusion, but a terrible presence has visited our castle.
[236:40.41]A demon!
[236:41.40]He claims he's here to collect on a debt owed to him by your mother.
[236:45.22]Can this be true?
[236:46.62]Since we were unable to immediately deliver the requested bounty, he said he'd return later for triple the amount of gold, or he'd curse the entire village.
[236:55.54]He then vanished in a cloud of foul-smelling green smoke.
[236:59.37]Your majesty, I hope you have a plan.
[237:02.51]Something must be done before he returns.
[237:04.35]Wait, what does he want to do?
[237:05.41]Foul green smoke.
[237:05.83]Make 100,000 gold in 40 days.
[237:06.39]Huh?
[237:06.55]100,000 gold?
[237:06.81]So what do I just only have tax collectors?
[237:30.09]Gold spin?
[237:31.39]Gambling hall, gold.
[237:56.12]Your Majesty, a new building is complete.
[238:37.17]Impossible.
[239:11.26]Dude, that was so much!
[239:44.08]Your Highness?
[239:44.66]Oh, I'm gonna cut you off here.
[239:46.31]This is getting a little ridiculous.
[240:15.50]Your Majesty!
[240:18.60]We just had 20,000 gold and you just lost it.
[240:22.17]All of it.
[240:25.31]So gold... It's red and... Hold on.
[240:31.75]So gold happens, like, way less percent of the time.
[240:36.55]If you guys don't think I'm going to beat this by doing just this, you're out of your mind.
[241:00.22]Come on!
[241:01.82]It's been blue fucking five times in a row.
[241:23.60]D'oh!
[241:30.56]Your highness, if our kingdom is to prosper, it needs more heroes.
[241:42.85]No!
[242:05.35]Nobody will miss this.
[242:07.99]Stealing from me.
[242:09.43]Shit.
[242:11.97]Come on.
[242:13.13]No.
[242:14.59]Don't do this.

[242:18.59]It's gonna be gold.

[242:21.73]Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold.
[242:33.47]Oh, there it is.

[242:34.99]Back to back gold.
[242:35.89]Right now, gold.

[242:45.50]Gold again.

[242:49.97]Gold!
[242:50.67]Here it comes.
[242:51.69]Here it is right here, this one.
[242:52.79]This next one is gold.

[243:10.14]Gold.
[243:10.52]Gold right now.
[243:11.62]Gold.
[243:11.82]I'm out of here.
[243:28.07]Okay, how do I make money?
[243:30.19]Let's make some money.
[243:30.81]I have $42,000.
[243:32.87]Okay, how do I get there?
[243:34.25]Okay, just do blue.
[243:34.87]Just do blue.
[244:00.79]I do gold again.
[244:02.37]It's going to be gold three times in a row.
[244:14.28]Okay.
[244:15.48]Okay, we need... What do I do?
[244:18.38]Okay, I need to pick some... Marketplace.
[244:25.96]Right?
[244:27.15]Marketplace.
[244:28.09]And then...
[244:34.41]Nobody will miss this.
[244:36.19]Now what?
[244:37.65]Your Highness, if our kingdom is to prosper, it needs more heroes.
[244:52.39]Okay, shit.
[244:53.69]Alright, that's a lot.
[244:56.97]Alright, let's make some money.
[245:00.33]I gotta level this building.
[245:08.50]Save the game.
[245:08.92]Alright, save the game.
[245:15.14]I need to make some gnomes.
[245:28.83]Your majesty, a new building is complete.
[245:36.64]Your majesty, our new building is complete.
[245:43.28]I'm outta here.
[245:45.34]My ambition has paid off.
[245:50.59]I'm gonna laugh my fucking ass off if I just do it by gambling on gold every time.
[246:19.13]They're destroying the kingdom.
[246:25.98]The king's just sitting in the gambling hall.
[246:29.20]I want all the guards posted out the door.
[246:32.30]I can do it.
[246:33.02]I can come back.
[246:37.04]No, not my gambling hall.
[246:45.39]Your Highness, if our kingdom is to prosper, it needs more heroes.
[246:51.19]They're leaving.
[246:53.95]I'm out of here.
[246:54.89]Tax collector.
[247:00.48]My power grew.
[247:01.50]I serve with pleasure.
[247:03.58]Tax collector.
[247:07.86]My power grew.
[247:15.48]Your Majesty, a new building is complete.
[247:18.28]I'm out of here.
[247:25.06]I'm out of here.
[247:26.44]All right, I'm done.
[247:27.22]I'm done.
[247:27.60]I'm done.
[247:27.94]I'm going to reload and just win it the regular way.
[247:31.67]I promise.
[247:32.21]I'm out of here.
[247:32.89]Not yet.
[247:33.21]Hold on.
[247:36.25]My ambition has paid off.
[247:54.57]I'm so close.
[247:56.03]I'm out of here.
[248:02.59]Saves the game.
[248:04.58]Okay.
[248:05.04]Go!
[248:06.40]Red.
[248:07.68]Red.
[248:32.23]Watch me go to zero.
[248:34.17]Oh, God.
[248:34.69]Okay, hold on.
[248:35.31]I win.
[248:35.73]Oh, fuck.
[248:35.99]I thought I had to wait 40 days.
[248:40.89]I did it.
[248:41.83]I win.
[248:59.16]You did it, Majesty.
[249:00.88]Once that vile creature was given the gold, he vanished in a puff of foul green smoke.
[249:07.11]Again, all in attendance felt compelled to immediately wash the stench from their clothes.
[249:13.73]May that repellent manifestation never again threaten our kingdom.
[249:17.57]I just, like, come out of the casino and I got big bags under my eyes.
[249:21.11]I did it.
[249:24.59]I did it, you fools.
[249:29.34]Now I spent $180,000 in the casino.
[249:36.25]I'm really happy that I get my free voucher for free parking on Thursday.
[249:41.92]That's worth it to me.
[249:43.88]Oh, and I got one free night stay.
[249:48.28]Okay, I'm glad.
[249:49.34]Good.
[249:59.22]You cheated.
[250:02.44]Still did it.
[250:04.78]Alright, that was that one.
[250:11.36]All people above the age of 25 are boomers.
[250:16.66]No, they're not.
[250:17.84]Uh, sorry.
[250:21.28]What, okay, what is it with the younger generation?
[250:23.66]If you're like, okay, what is the younger generation then?
[250:31.38]You know a generation is like a huge amount, a huge range of people, right?
[250:37.02]Zoomers.
[250:43.12]The younger generation.
[250:44.66]Yeah, there is a younger generation.
[250:47.27]But not every single person that's over the age of like 22 is a boomer.
[250:57.27]What, are you only a zoomer for like four years?
[251:01.56]You go from, oh yeah, Generation Z, Zoomer, sure, whatever.
[251:07.07]That's 15 to 19.
[251:10.47]And then everybody's a boomer.
[251:14.05]Huh?
[251:14.19]Where are we going?
[251:22.51]Alright, I can't do this one yet.
[251:26.51]Should I do the burp one?
[251:27.57]Let's try the burp one.
[251:30.03]Majesty, I'm here with the latest report from the chief tax collector.
[251:35.16]He reports that the fiscal quarter will soon be ending, and the treasury reports a deficit of money.
[251:41.06]You dare interfere with the plans of the Lich Queen?
[251:45.44]Your meddling presence has been like a thorn in my side.
[251:50.61]I will soon remove you and your sorry heroes.
[251:57.64]No, sorry, never mind.
[252:00.06]I was wrong.
[252:00.68]It was just my wife leaning into the fan, just really trying to scare me there, adventurer.
[252:06.94]Never mind about that one.
[252:08.12]We'll go back to your normal business.
[252:12.79]Majesty, I'm here with the latest report from the chief tax collector.
[252:17.91]He reports that the fiscal quarter will soon be ending, and the treasury reports a deficit of...
[252:29.36]Okay, drive the Lich Queen from her rocky lair and then defeat her.
[252:33.70]I'm gonna lose.
[252:35.85]No temples to Krypta available.
[252:37.99]No blacksmiths.
[252:39.03]What?
[252:43.71]No blacksmith inns, dwarf settlements, no rogues gallery.
[252:49.55]No, that's not what this is.
[252:50.86]That's Spider-Man's rogues gallery.
[252:53.48]Or Batman.
[252:54.26]Whatever the fuck it is.
[252:56.24]I can't do it.
[252:56.66]Okay, let's try it.
[253:03.58]First things first.
[253:05.42]Marketplace.
[253:07.12]Second things first.
[253:08.90]Godhouses.
[253:09.42]A couple of them.
[253:10.28]At least two or three of them.
[253:14.30]Third things first.
[253:15.86]Warrior's Guild.
[253:16.94]Two of them.
[253:17.76]One.
[253:20.28]Two.
[253:23.27]And lastly, firstly, the Ranger's Guild.
[253:25.47]Right here.
[253:25.77]Go.
[253:26.17]Go.
[253:26.45]Hurry up.
[253:28.13]The faster you move your fucking hands, the faster they work.
[253:30.19]Okay, that's starting to hurt.
[253:35.87]Let's get some healers, probably going to need them.
[253:42.95]What do they have spells healing?
[253:45.69]Did they do it on their own?
[253:49.21]Hey, hey, hey, get out of here.
[253:51.59]Thank you.
[254:01.46]I don't like this king.
[254:02.28]He gambles too much.
[254:04.78]Yeah.
[254:05.70]I saved us from Satan.
[254:09.04]Okay.
[254:10.38]So... If I hadn't have done that, there would have been tons of destruction across the whole world.
[254:19.02]My gambling saved everybody.
[254:21.42]Not a... Not a sword was raised during that conflict with Satan.
[254:30.73]Your Majesty, a new building is complete.
[254:34.53]Sovereign, your marketplace now serves you better.
[254:38.39]Shh.
[254:38.49]I'm out of the rush.
[254:40.63]Your Majesty, a new building is complete.
[254:43.41]Your Highness, we've improved the guardhouse.
[254:46.03]It's kind of funny how, isn't it weird that if you just say Sean, that sounds like that's not the same guy.
[254:56.60]Build it.
[255:02.45]Hurry up.
[255:04.97]Come on.
[255:08.73]Hey, Sean.
[255:09.35]Yeah, Sean.
[255:11.97]That's Sean Connery.
[255:13.69]I need this built now.
[255:24.04]More gold, your majesty.
[255:29.52]Let Umbrella help.
[255:32.84]You're boring me!
[255:33.71]Hurry up!
[255:38.31]Can we talk about why Sean... Sean?
[255:41.83]Sean.
[255:43.53]Well, if you didn't say the H, it would be just... Seen.
[255:47.47]Seen.
[255:49.61]Seen Connery.
[255:57.32]Where you going?
[255:58.92]Where you going?
[256:01.48]What are you, dope?
[256:02.99]Why are you going all the way up here?
[256:06.25]He went up here to plant a flower.
[256:08.25]Oh.
[256:08.55]Good.
[256:09.59]Well, at least you... I mean, that's... Well, they can't fight.
[256:20.29]They can't fight.
[256:20.87]I get it.
[256:26.96]Come on.
[256:28.34]Get out there.
[256:28.96]You won't even build my goddamn rogues gallery.
[256:42.14]Uh-oh.
[256:43.90]Does that mean she's on her way?
[256:48.64]A foul beast approaches.
[256:51.24]She's already on her way.
[256:52.00]Good.
[256:52.57]Hurry up.
[256:53.07]Fuck.
[257:02.06]Come on, get out there.
[257:04.34]Never mind.
[257:05.20]I was gonna say something stupid.
[257:09.36]Get out there!
[257:10.10]I need more healers.
[257:10.82]They heal automatically, right?
[257:12.20]Good.
[257:32.03]Is this a... Is this a thing?
[257:35.15]Is that a thing over there?
[257:38.07]Is this a thing?
[257:41.11]From where, these?
[257:41.95]Uh-oh.
[257:45.80]Go down there.
[257:46.40]I don't have any money.
[257:47.64]Uh-oh.
[257:50.86]Come on.
[257:51.50]Don't let them do this.
[257:52.60]There's so many of you guys right now.
[257:55.64]Don't do this shit.
[257:59.29]Don't be stupid.
[258:02.77]Tough fight Thank God I Don't know anything about what's going on my nose These are considered heroes somehow The little gnomes are considered a hero I
[258:32.49]What a dumb fucking game.
[258:33.95]Tough fight.
[258:35.23]Like, I'm going to uninstall it.
[258:36.35]I don't even want to play it anymore.
[258:37.25]A foul beast approaches.
[258:44.15]Hey, I'm getting better!
[258:49.71]Everyone's just like, whoa, hey.
[258:51.76]Let a brother help.
[258:59.94]I need a trading post, like, up here or something.
[259:02.48]I need money.
[259:05.24]What the heck, man?
[259:06.76]It was just a joke.
[259:09.20]I don't mean that.
[259:11.46]I don't mean that.
[259:13.92]Healing herbs.
[259:14.40]Can we just pick them up?
[259:15.12]What is this?
[259:15.52]The inhabitants of this building have agreed to join your kingdom.
[259:18.99]You got any money?
[259:31.48]Well, I mean, if you don't have any money, then what do you want me to do?
[259:35.17]I need money.
[259:36.23]Trading post.
[259:36.85]Get it up there, then.
[259:56.92]Alright, well I see something here.
[260:00.22]Who's that?
[260:01.48]Vampire.
[260:03.70]Vampire.
[260:04.68]Don't get yourself killed.
[260:05.68]You're level 4.
[260:06.40]You're one of the highest levels I have right now.
[260:08.00]Don't be stupid.
[260:11.12]Level 4.
[260:13.38]How badly is he going to get your ass kicked here?
[260:17.28]Pretty badly.
[260:17.78]The rogues don't do anything.
[260:18.52]I'm never making one ever again.
[260:20.74]They don't do anything.
[260:22.50]They run up and they go, I'm scared, and they run away.
[260:28.62]What's my favorite color green?
[260:33.81]Um, okay.
[260:35.13]I'm just walking around aimlessly.
[260:39.93]Good.
[260:40.45]Oh, we have a new, uh, goblin cave.
[260:46.11]Where is it?
[260:46.95]There it is.
[260:47.29]Nice.
[260:47.45]Who's dying?
[260:57.70]So many people are dying right now.
[260:59.04]What the hell?
[261:01.72]Oh, come on, man.
[261:02.88]This is expert mode.
[261:04.00]Protect... Protect your area, please.
[261:13.11]Where are all the other assholes that are... Like you and... Like, I have... It's so many... Where are they?
[261:25.30]He's just attacking.
[261:26.56]He's just killing people.
[261:29.62]Rat King.
[261:35.26]Hopefully the tower will actually kill it eventually, and the guard.
[261:39.20]Take your time, Quick Parry.
[261:41.58]No, that's not... They're from the same town.
[261:45.44]That's why he has Quick Parry.
[261:46.82]That's not the same person.
[261:48.60]Well, this is bad.
[261:51.31]This is very bad.
[262:04.61]I think this is done.
[262:05.27]I don't have enough money.
[262:08.73]If the caravan can go back and forth once or twice, then fine.
[262:14.99]She's just dumping people over here on me.
[262:16.64]Nah, this is not good.
[262:20.86]This is over.
[262:23.25]It's almost over.
[262:27.10]Uh, I know what I did wrong, though.
[262:30.72]I made, like, ten priests.
[262:34.74]For no reason.
[262:40.73]Shouldn't have done that.
[262:41.45]Hmm...
[262:56.75]I hate the tsk, tsk, tsk sound.
[263:01.33]It does get a very, very, very clear point across, though.
[263:11.76]Well, caravan seems to, uh... Oh, shit.
[263:15.80]Okay.
[263:16.72]Get the treasure chest!
[263:18.35]What are you doing?
[263:26.32]What are you doing?
[263:27.26]What are you doing?
[263:28.16]Is this game over?
[263:32.66]Open the gates!
[263:41.89]Open the gates!
[263:43.59]A local blacksmith offers new services.
[263:47.81]Close the gates!
[263:49.79]Close the gate!
[263:53.25]No!
[263:53.53]A foul beast approaches.
[263:59.31]I'm actually still in it.
[264:03.13]If I can... If I can hold this off, then I should be okay.
[264:10.56]Looks like it might... Why are the priests in the front lines?
[264:13.64]They should be back here.
[264:29.55]I might hold him off.
[264:36.78]Oh, here come the vampires.
[264:39.20]G. Not a second G. Just good, you know what I mean?
[264:46.64]Oh, here come the vampires.
[264:48.52]Good.
[264:50.25]Yeah, look at this.
[264:53.33]He's taking all their points.
[264:54.75]Yeah, bye.
[265:02.05]That's kind of creepy.
[265:02.79]I'm not gonna lie.
[265:04.07]Where'd I get the money?
[265:06.83]Hold on.
[265:07.17]Somebody just deposited... Oh, it was the caravan, I think.
[265:09.79]Quick!
[265:10.37]Get him out of here!
[265:10.89]Come on!
[265:11.89]Extort the rogue's den?
[265:13.92]It's gone.
[265:14.48]It was destroyed.
[265:20.36]Along with my blacksmith.
[265:31.68]Yeah.
[265:31.84]Yeah.
[265:32.26]Yeah.
[265:33.10]I think we're okay.
[265:34.08]No, I blew it already.
[265:35.22]No, it's already blown.
[265:36.24]Caravan's dead.
[265:37.32]And here comes another 50 skeletons.
[265:38.88]Good.
[266:04.20]Yeah, this is a lost cause at this point.
[266:11.29]That's a lost cause.
[266:15.09]Oh, well.
[266:16.53]The Dark Forest.
[266:19.04]Brashnard's ultimate sphere of power.
[266:24.64]What's this one?
[266:26.04]Requires the barren waste.
[266:28.28]Oh, it's a secret.
[266:28.92]This one's expert.
[266:31.54]Alright, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[266:32.89]Requires the Forsaken Land.
[266:34.49]Where's that one?
[266:35.53]Because then I can do the secret quest.
[266:38.15]The Forsaken Land.
[266:43.26]I didn't do these.
[266:48.01]Let's do it.
[266:49.03]My liege, while this land holds great promise, I should point out that there is much that requires your immediate attention.
[266:56.61]Our town is still beset by the marauding monsters who lurk in this forsaken land.
[267:01.66]We will only know true prosperity when these interlopers are kept at bay.
[267:06.96]It's in your best interest to employ the services of a variety of heroes.
[267:11.90]With their skills and the blessings of the gods, we may be able to safeguard this community.
[267:17.78]Destroy the evil castle to win this epic quest.
[267:21.12]No wizard's guild.
[267:22.72]Non-human races.
[267:23.86]Palace level 3 or any temples are available.
[267:27.01]All right, let's just... Let's go.
[267:28.49]Look at how small this is.
[267:29.35]We got it.
[267:31.81]It's already level 3?
[267:32.45]They're just making it easy.
[267:34.39]They're just making it... Okay.
[267:39.25]Whoa, so hard.
[267:41.87]I know I shouldn't do that.
[267:43.48]Sovereign, your marketplace now serves you better.
[267:47.82]Let's get a bunch of rangers.
[267:50.03]No, no.
[267:51.91]Two warriors guilds.
[267:56.03]Two warriors guilds, two rangers guilds.
[268:00.31]And... Get some more rangers up here.
[268:05.49]Where's the goblin house?
[268:07.47]Guard houses, get them up here.
[268:10.73]I'm not fucking around.
[268:13.99]Sovereign, your marketplace now serves you better.
[268:18.74]Let's do... What does it say?
[268:28.29]Welcome to the Forsaken Land.
[268:29.25]Use the reward flags.
[268:30.27]I know how to do that.
[268:34.01]We got rats.
[268:38.28]An unwelcome guest.
[268:42.71]Who said that?
[268:44.09]I serve with pleasure.
[268:56.10]Build it.
[269:01.06]Blacksmith as well.
[269:02.12]Get it over here.
[269:04.20]Just please don't kill him.
[269:07.48]The tax collector can't just turn around and punch you.
[269:17.05]Don't die.
[269:17.83]I just need one... Just kill the dumb thing.
[269:27.29]Don't let it kill you, please.
[269:30.11]Don't embarrass me, I'm a beginner.
[269:31.37]Where's my blacksmith?
[269:45.97]More gold, more gold.
[269:46.93]I'm going for it.
[269:47.79]I'm trying, man.
[269:49.92]Ooh, there we go.
[269:51.70]Alright.
[269:52.76]Is there a way to get more peasants?
[270:01.18]Put this shit down here.
[270:02.10]Oh, it's too close to the marketplace.
[270:09.33]Put it up here, then.
[270:12.05]Okay.
[270:15.38]More gold.
[270:17.44]Still waiting for you to actually build the halls for the knights.
[270:28.88]Good find.
[270:33.35]Creature den.
[270:34.03]Ah, get rid of that.
[270:36.01]I don't want to deal with this shit.
[270:37.67]300 gold.
[270:41.47]What do you want?
[270:41.95]What does it want me to look at here?
[270:44.41]A nearby monarch, King Randolph, admires your cause and offers his aid.
[270:47.69]He has sent a caravan to bolster your economy.
[270:50.77]I think it's Randolph.
[270:54.53]Is this Randolph's?
[270:55.68]Okay, this thing is being under attack.
[271:07.46]This guy is starting to sound like Bane.
[271:17.60]Why did you have to say that?
[271:19.60]I'm not going to be able to unhear that now.
[271:22.59]Bane just is Sean Connery.
[271:36.67]I didn't even think about that.
[271:41.21]You're, like, spot on with that one.
[271:45.84]Oh my god, there's a lot of things coming down here right now.
[271:49.10]And, um, I'm not ready to fight three trolls.
[271:54.06]I just put this up.
[271:56.36]What if I had more than one fucking peasant?
[271:59.07]Like, why do I have one person?
[272:01.25]I'm gonna lose on beginner.
[272:06.77]It took them like 12 minutes to build this.
[272:10.75]What the hell is wrong with you?
[272:12.51]Finish this building!
[272:13.73]Oh my god.
[272:14.95]Annoying.
[272:41.59]Did you kill the peasant?
[272:42.91]Is that what happened?
[272:44.83]You just killed the peasant.
[272:46.05]Is that what happened?
[272:47.19]Cool.
[272:47.53]Great.
[272:48.27]I'm glad you finished.
[272:48.89]Took you fucking an hour.
[272:49.78]Good.
[272:50.24]Glad to know.
[273:06.32]Fucking dick.
[273:07.18]There we go, 8,000.
[273:07.68]Okay, I'm not... I'm not sharky anymore.
[273:09.76]Oh, there it is.
[273:11.82]There's the dark castle.
[273:12.96]Found it.
[273:33.53]Just gotta have, like, a bunch of people, level up a little bit, and then send them in and we win.
[273:39.79]Not that hard.
[273:40.43]It's fucking easy.
[273:44.37]He destroyed that.
[273:46.42]Don't even, uh, go after the bears.
[273:48.00]No reason to.
[273:51.54]You know what?
[273:56.56]Just get up there.
[273:57.18]Just kill it.
[273:58.54]Just send the whole damn troop over there.
[274:02.82]Wait, how did you get up here?
[274:15.97]How'd they get up here this quickly?
[274:19.07]Did they...
[274:32.61]Just get up here, all of you.
[274:33.91]There we go.
[274:35.55]Watch this shit.
[274:36.55]Somebody's got to claim it.
[274:39.87]I'll just end this one so I can do the secret mission.
[274:44.43]I want the tax collector to come up here.
[274:46.69]$7,300?
[274:46.73]I'll be up there in no time.
[275:04.49]They got it.
[275:11.39]Please don't let this guy kill everybody here.
[275:14.40]It's almost dead.
[275:15.76]Thank you.
[275:30.29]Nice job.
[275:31.07]Time for the secret mission.
[275:32.33]It has been unlocked.
[275:56.23]That's it, right?
[275:57.25]No.
[275:57.57]What?
[275:58.25]Where is it?
[275:58.67]Which one was it?
[275:59.23]This one, right?
[276:00.17]Elven Treachery?
[276:02.06]Is it the secret one?
[276:10.26]Majesty?
[276:11.89]It grieves me to be the bearer of such intolerable news.
[276:16.21]An elvish miscreant has just left the castle.
[276:19.91]He came to deliver the message that his disreputable brethren have taken your son hostage.
[276:26.12]Apparently, they see only the size of your treasury, not the depth of your skilled leadership.
[276:32.84]These foul opportunists demand you pay a ransom, or, they say, you'll never again see your son alive.
[276:40.05]How shall we deal with this elvish impudence, my liege?
[276:43.35]Hmm.
[276:46.74]Make 50,000 gold in 30 days to pay the ransom or defeat the elves, all enemy heroes and buildings before that time.
[276:53.08]No elves will join you.
[276:55.61]I think I can handle this.
[277:04.61]You can't gamble because no elves.
[277:09.06]Oh.
[277:10.14]Are you kidding?
[277:10.58]Really?
[277:15.88]Shit.
[277:18.80]That's not good.
[277:24.90]What?
[277:26.08]That's bullshit.
[277:27.88]Why is it only the elves that gamble?
[277:33.34]Alright, let's do Palace Level 2.
[277:35.80]I need four heroes.
[277:38.04]Let's just get them and go to Palace Level 2 immediately.
[277:40.16]I need some Guard Houses.
[277:44.85]Alright.
[277:45.79]Go.
[277:48.73]Get Paladins.
[277:49.35]Get Paladins.
[277:49.95]What's the tech to get Paladins?
[277:51.43]What's the tech tree?
[277:57.37]Your Highness, if our kingdom is to prosper, it needs more heroes.
[278:01.93]I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[278:02.99]Your Majesty, a new building is complete.
[278:05.67]Your Majesty, a new building is complete.
[278:08.25]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[278:09.90]God damn it.
[278:10.90]No.
[278:12.20]You built a one unit.
[278:13.66]This is the shit that happened in Warcraft 3.
[278:15.22]Your marketplace now serves you better.
[278:20.70]No, go up here.
[278:21.80]Why?
[278:22.42]Stop.
[278:22.86]I know.
[278:27.09]He just went in the marketplace!
[278:32.23]Why is he allowed in my marketplace?
[278:37.53]What?
[278:45.60]Are you kidding me right now?
[278:48.89]He went into my marketplace and was just hanging out in there.
[278:51.75]And nobody saw him?
[278:52.77]Nobody decided they were gonna kill him.
[278:55.28]Another crock of fucking dog shit.
[278:56.00]Alright, we're good.
[279:09.08]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[279:10.04]I got everyone here.
[279:11.30]Improve the guardhouse.
[279:14.45]Start firing the arrows.
[279:17.11]Come on.
[279:17.97]Get the gnomes out here, too.
[279:19.11]Come on.
[279:28.16]Quickly.
[279:29.84]Level two, palace.
[279:30.80]A lot of you seem to be joining the wilds.
[279:35.32]I feel like that's an AI doing that.
[279:37.34]Alright, we got it.
[279:38.00]Come on, level two.
[279:39.15]Go, go, go.
[279:39.59]Hurry up.
[279:51.53]Attack him!
[279:54.99]Attack!
[279:56.13]What the fuck are you doing?
[279:59.60]Why are you just standing there?
[280:03.42]You've just taken arrows in the side of the head and didn't even react.
[280:17.40]Okay, good.
[280:18.25]Palace level 2.
[280:19.65]Get it out.
[280:20.93]Good.
[280:21.13]I want... What are the paladins?
[280:22.83]Crypta?
[280:23.27]Chrom?
[280:23.59]Which is the paladins' one?
[280:24.67]Which is the paladins' one?
[280:40.42]Get a Doris Guild, and then you can build Paladins in the Warriors Guild.
[280:45.24]A Doris Guild?
[280:48.00]Doris Guild.
[280:50.87]Got it.
[280:54.63]Warriors Guild.
[280:55.29]Get it up.
[280:58.05]Okay.
[280:58.83]How we doing?
[281:02.25]How we doing?
[281:02.69]How we doing?
[281:03.05]How we doing?
[281:05.40]Good.
[281:11.42]Sovereign, a building has been upgraded.
[281:14.58]I need a trading post.
[281:15.88]Hey, I'm getting better at this.
[281:18.20]Hurry up.
[281:18.40]Sovereign, a building has been upgraded.
[281:21.02]We just need something down here.
[281:22.32]There's nobody down here.
[281:23.42]Just get it built here.
[281:24.96]Sovereign, your marketplace now serves you better.
[281:28.08]Hey, I'm getting better at this.
[281:32.77]Your Majesty, a new building is complete.
[281:36.60]Recruit a monk?
[281:38.84]Check.
[281:39.48]Okay.
[281:39.98]What do the monks do?
[281:41.02]Paladin.
[281:41.22]Oooh.
[281:41.62]Get some paladins out here.
[281:43.92]Oh yes.
[281:44.20]Noble paladin.
[281:45.06]I've always wanted to say that.
[281:46.26]I need a blacksmith.
[282:09.96]Paladin?
[282:15.20]What do they got for weapons?
[282:18.50]Level one paladin?
[282:19.41]Oh, they're running away.
[282:20.31]This is perfect.
[282:21.17]I'm gonna make like only paladins.
[282:22.37]A hundred of them.
[282:23.43]Paladins and monks.
[282:25.19]Your majesty, a new building is complete.
[282:36.92]I'm gonna do it on money.
[282:37.78]Not good.
[282:38.94]This shit's gotta get built.
[282:41.48]Hurry up.
[282:45.69]Ooh, there's the town.
[282:46.67]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do it.
[282:50.61]Don't follow.
[282:51.65]Don't follow.
[282:53.29]Stay out of the tower.
[282:54.79]What are you doing?
[282:56.21]You don't just go right into the back of their base.
[282:58.74]This is the first time you've ever played Dota, you fucking idiot.
[283:01.72]What are you thinking?
[283:04.45]You're just diving.
[283:05.20]This is feeding.
[283:05.90]Intentional feeding.
[283:06.64]That was like fucking a thousand dollars.
[283:09.48]You're not just gonna kill these things, are you?
[283:12.74]Leave!
[283:14.14]Get out of here!
[283:15.08]Oh, I hate you.
[283:18.69]Turn around, please.
[283:19.63]Now is the last chance.
[283:20.67]Run!
[283:21.31]Run away!
[283:23.23]Huh?
[283:23.35]Huh?
[283:30.91]What are you doing?
[283:33.63]Get out!
[283:35.69]I can't fucking believe you're still alive.
[283:39.57]You did not listen to your coach.
[283:41.28]And I'm furious right now.
[283:42.98]Good.
[283:43.10]Alright, I need more money.
[283:44.40]Let's get some more paladins.
[283:57.49]Veteran City Guard.
[283:58.71]Good.
[283:59.73]I need more units.
[284:00.99]I need more fucking money.
[284:03.71]What the hell's going on over here?
[284:05.59]Level 7.
[284:06.05]Damn.
[284:06.35]Okay, good.
[284:06.83]Good for you.
[284:08.37]Just don't die.
[284:11.98]How we doing?
[284:12.46]Everybody alright?
[284:14.28]I need more money, though.
[284:16.06]Paladin comes out.
[284:23.17]What happened to my other paladin?
[284:26.96]No, why are you all like this?
[284:31.32]I could probably kill this, though.
[284:41.57]No.
[284:43.53]All right, no more paladins.
[284:44.59]I'm going, I'm getting weird with this.
[284:46.83]Of course, there's a random fucking rat in here.
[284:58.38]Where are they?
[284:59.40]Three, one... I gotta keep track of them.
[285:05.86]Are you taking my... Are you stealing my money?
[285:11.99]Good.
[285:13.17]You fucker.
[285:15.11]Oh, goddammit.
[285:28.08]Where are my paladins?
[285:37.64]I spent my money too early on the paladins.
[285:40.28]That was like four grand.
[285:41.24]Praise Doros!
[285:58.24]Why?
[285:58.74]What are you doing?
[286:00.50]Why are they so dumb?
[286:03.74]I guess I don't even have to do anything about this.
[286:06.87]Are you going to take this whole city by yourself?
[286:11.09]Refreshing.
[286:19.93]Your Majesty, the royal treasury is nearly empty.
[286:23.05]Victory is not in the cards.
[286:25.59]What a pain in the ass.
[286:26.41]Look, where did you come from?
[286:28.07]Your Highness, we've improved the guardhouse.
[286:30.73]Turn around and fight.
[286:31.79]Kill them.
[286:32.41]You can kill these.
[286:33.69]Oh, no, you can't.
[286:34.29]Run.
[286:35.47]I need a blacksmith.
[286:37.37]What happened to... Oh, I got money.
[286:41.89]I need a blacksmith.
[286:42.59]The law of Doros is of all others.
[286:47.33]I serve with pleasure.
[286:54.40]Seven.
[286:54.78]Don't get yourself killed.
[286:55.78]Okay, at least I have this somewhat protected.
[287:01.72]So I can at least make some money.
[287:04.00]All right, I have enough.
[287:05.24]Then upgrade this once this is done.
[287:24.25]You guys are fu- oh yeah, fuckin' fearless.
[287:26.35]Get in there.
[287:27.09]Alright, this'll ease up some of the pressure, I think.
[287:31.49]How much money do you get for doing this and raising a building?
[287:37.31]Zero.
[287:37.71]Cool.
[287:40.24]That's gonna- I want these- you gotta level up.
[287:44.42]Don't just run around aimlessly, like this person's doing.
[287:49.24]victories not in the cards yeah you know you're dead you know you're not gonna do victories not in the car this thing you're gonna attack anybody all right level up I want you guys at level five this is like their main base over here in the top left I don't agree with this uh course of action but that's okay victories not in the car energies of light
[288:16.50]We did it.
[288:17.50]We raised it.
[288:18.08]Alright, now let's expand.
[288:19.08]Okay, time to expand.
[288:24.16]We're gonna do a inn over here.
[288:31.02]Expand.
[288:33.20]And another trading post.
[288:40.29]Why would you do this?
[288:41.03]Why would you just throw yourself away like that?
[288:50.41]I would just throw it all away.
[288:52.45]I don't understand it.
[288:54.69]I need trading points.
[288:55.99]I'm going to upgrade this 570.
[289:01.80]As long as no paladins die, I'm completely happy.
[289:19.47]This is good.
[289:19.93]Fine.
[289:20.21]Take over there.
[289:20.97]I need a... I need a guard tower here.
[289:27.38]That's good.
[289:31.28]Cool.
[289:32.32]I know.
[289:33.82]I know.
[289:34.28]I know.
[289:34.50]I know.
[289:34.86]God damn it.
[289:36.13]F***ing rats.
[289:36.87]I need a guard tower right here.
[289:40.03]Stupid sewer entrance.
[289:41.09]They can take that.
[289:41.67]They can handle it.
[289:44.82]Alright, I need... Oh, I need shit here.
[289:48.24]I need, uh... I need some... I need a paladin, quick.
[289:51.40]No!
[289:53.06]Every unit I have is gonna be a paladin.
[289:58.50]I need money.
[289:59.46]Caravan, hurry up.
[290:02.30]Come on, get in here.
[290:03.98]Hurry!
[290:04.36]I need the money!
[290:06.56]I need the money now.
[290:08.86]Please.
[290:11.62]Please.
[290:13.42]Please.
[290:14.08]Alright, but don't just... Okay, I guess you're just gonna... You're just gonna do that.
[290:23.81]Chase him away.
[290:27.09]Guardhouse.
[290:27.55]I need one right here.
[290:29.47]No, I need a... I need my fucking money.
[290:32.65]Come on, just throw your life away like that.
[290:42.36]You're driving me crazy with this.
[290:43.58]You're driving me crazy.
[290:54.43]I don't know what you do.
[290:56.19]I guess you're just going to do it.
[290:57.53]I guess.
[290:59.85]Why would I stop you here?
[291:02.67]Oh, wow.
[291:03.35]They all teleported.
[291:05.99]And they won't fight.
[291:06.99]They're like insects.
[291:10.46]I serve.
[291:14.39]Huh?
[291:14.55]Don't ask me what the hell's going on here.
[291:16.13]Level five.
[291:28.40]I'll take it.
[291:28.86]You know, fuck it.
[291:30.64]Let's go.
[291:31.16]Fuck it.
[291:31.58]Come on.
[291:31.80]Go on.
[291:34.48]I don't have any money.
[291:38.13]I just gave you 500 bucks.
[291:39.01]Refreshing.
[291:40.59]Energies of light.
[291:45.24]They can... She can two-shot most of the people here.
[291:53.74]Here they come.
[291:58.39]Take it all over.
[292:01.49]Yeah, this is it.
[292:02.03]This is game over.
[292:03.55]This is definitely game over at this point.
[292:06.50]They can't do shit.
[292:07.34]They can't do anything.
[292:10.72]I'm going to have like six paladins over here right now.
[292:16.64]I'm going to put another... Very nice.
[292:19.84]Very good job.
[292:20.32]I'm going to put another trading post up there.
[292:22.05]Like over here.
[292:22.61]What are you doing?
[292:23.15]Trading post.
[292:24.83]And...
[292:45.79]Upgrade it just to do it.
[292:49.25]Get another one.
[292:49.71]And this is where it all ends.
[292:51.25]I can do this with just 24,000.
[292:52.25]At this point, I've got way more than they do.
[292:53.40]What is this, expert or enhanced?
[293:17.27]Advance, okay.
[293:19.53]Take it out.
[293:21.49]Expand up here.
[293:24.57]Let's grab a couple people, I would say.
[293:28.81]Let's do another inn.
[293:30.85]Let's put an inn over here.
[293:31.51]Somewhere in the middle, in between.
[293:36.65]Let's do a... Another trading post over here, too.
[293:41.92]Yeah, fuck it.
[293:42.50]Let's go.
[293:51.72]Take a look up top left.
[294:02.34]I just can't do anything.
[294:07.42]So they don't have any other units besides the elves.
[294:11.62]Wait, wasn't I supposed to make like $30,000?
[294:15.10]How many days do I have before it's all over?
[294:23.67]What?
[294:24.11]I have four days?
[294:24.95]I only have four days.
[294:29.71]No way.
[294:34.28]Take this shit.
[294:34.68]No, no.
[294:35.08]Stay up here, guys.
[294:37.84]Stay up here.
[294:40.68]Oh, okay.
[294:40.96]Now I have 40.
[294:41.26]Well, I'm about to win.
[294:53.77]I think everything's dead up here.
[294:56.47]No, don't.
[294:56.91]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[294:57.71]You need to go look.
[294:58.37]You have to.
[294:59.33]Please.
[294:59.99]There you go.
[295:00.65]I knew you should have looked.
[295:01.45]It's game over.
[295:02.29]I win.
[295:02.51]Yeah, the paladins are unstoppable.
[295:24.29]Although I might get one killed here.
[295:28.03]Yeah.
[295:29.37]Level 9!
[295:36.37]We still good?
[295:36.97]I think so.
[295:41.21]Where you guys all going?
[295:44.17]Why would you leave?
[295:48.03]This... All this shit up here.
[295:49.67]Why would you leave?
[295:56.19]Go claim it.
[295:56.75]Somebody claim it.
[295:57.77]What the fuck are you doing?
[296:13.80]I deem your mandate just.
[296:17.95]You still alive?
[296:20.51]Yeah, you're good.
[296:21.87]Well, no, you can't even... Yeah, there's two people up here.
[296:24.83]This game won't... Unless they have something down here, which I don't think they do.
[296:38.38]Are they gonna surrender?
[296:46.72]I can speed the game up.
[296:50.81]Um.
[296:52.61]Refreshing.
[296:54.03]I mean, I got to say, easier to understand what's going on.
[296:57.19]Are you going to build this shit or what?
[297:00.11]Hey, I'm getting better at this.
[297:14.39]Your majesty, a new building is complete.
[297:17.29]I'm still alive.
[297:18.60]Your majesty, a new building is complete.
[297:22.38]All right, now the towers are here.
[297:29.73]I'm old and need a slow paced game.
[297:31.63]Wild adventure builds character.
[297:34.41]Your highness, we've improved the guard house.
[297:37.36]Your highness, we've improved the guard house.
[297:40.12]This is game over right here.
[297:43.04]Game over.
[297:47.18]Level 10?
[297:47.40]I didn't even know you were level 10.
[297:50.52]Pick up all the paladins.
[297:59.73]Somebody's- who's gonna claim the $1500?
[298:01.11]There's one- oh, there's one more up here.
[298:06.37]I'll just melt in this building.
[298:11.72]This is a made building too.
[298:14.06]Just a melt fest.
[298:20.43]I deem your mandate just.
[298:23.67]They had a huge, huge town too.
[298:26.49]It was here, here, here, here, here.
[298:29.01]I deem your mandate just.
[298:32.87]What year is this game from?
[298:33.77]2001?
[298:33.80]2002?
[298:33.88]Something like that.
[298:37.10]2000.
[298:37.12]There you go.
[298:48.02]Well, I have another 20 days to get rid of this town up here.
[298:50.84]I'm pretty much good to go.
[299:02.28]No, everything is dead up here, isn't it?
[299:03.72]Yeah, that's it.
[299:04.40]I win.
[299:05.38]Game over.
[299:12.52]Game over.
[299:13.98]Paladins win.
[299:25.02]I think MVP of this game is, uh, Hilltopper.
[299:29.96]Level 10, scouting around.
[299:32.93]Doing a pretty damn good job.
[299:36.71]Pretty damn good job.
[299:38.05]Awesome.
[299:51.07]Your son is returned to you, your highness.
[299:53.77]Though we were unable to catch the nefarious elven kidnappers, the new head of the palace guard promises that such an intolerable breach of security will never occur again.
[300:03.78]Rest well, my liege.
[300:06.27]Your family is safe at last.
[300:09.39]Nice.
[300:12.83]Very, very, very cool.
[300:16.23]So what else is left down here?
[300:19.72]All the ones with stars are the ones that I've beaten, so there's still a lot.
[300:25.11]Am I ready for anything else?
[300:26.71]Am I ready for the siege?
[300:28.41]No.
[300:29.25]No way.
[300:35.22]There's not a chance in hell I'm gonna do this.
[300:40.18]Rise of the Ratman, no.
[300:41.78]That one was too much.
[300:43.83]Can I handle this now?
[300:44.89]I don't think I could.
[300:48.53]Slay the mighty dragon.
[300:51.83]Forgive the intrusion, your majesty, but you must awaken.
[300:55.03]The day that Julek, the prophet, spoke of is upon us.
[300:58.97]The mighty dragon, Vendral, has awakened from his thousand-year slumber in the mountains of doom and is attacking the realm.
[301:06.25]There is little time.
[301:07.71]You must recruit forces to find the weapons that will help destroy this threat before the kingdom becomes a scorched, barren waste.
[301:15.10]Send heroes to find the sword of Byron the Dragonsmiter.
[301:18.72]This manor of blade is the only known weapon that may cleave Vendral's hide.
[301:25.44]Hold on.
[301:26.72]Send heroes to find the sword of Byron the Dragonsniffer, or whatever it is.
[301:31.38]This manor of blade is the only known weapon.
[301:34.76]Find the sword of Byron.
[301:40.21]The only guild you have is the Temple of Helia.
[301:44.11]You do not have the means to build any guilds or temples.
[301:46.97]What?
[301:48.39]You'll have to find and organize the locals in order to defend your establishment.
[301:53.42]Use Solari to rally the guilds lying in the countryside.
[301:58.74]Find the hidden sword site and destroy it in order to obtain the magic sword, which will make Vendral mortal.
[302:05.38]Who has disturbed my slumber?
[302:12.81]Uh... Level 2 weapons, go.
[302:21.43]He's... He's here now.
[302:25.29]He's already here?
[302:28.97]What the fuck?
[302:29.69]How am I supposed to do this?
[302:30.49]He's destroying everything.
[302:32.21]I need to send a... A Solaris somewhere?
[302:42.59]Where'd they go?
[302:43.33]Just hurry up.
[302:43.76]I guess find a new home?
[303:08.57]Darkness has won the day.
[303:12.25]My soul blazes brighter.
[303:14.91]Hi-ho.
[303:16.73]Darkness has won the day.
[303:19.28]It's just like I'm reading.
[303:20.64]I'm reading a line.
[303:22.42]Darkness.
[303:23.40]My soul blazes brighter.
[303:24.88]Whatever, I don't care.
[303:28.68]Can we kill this thing?
[303:30.39]I don't think we can kill this.
[303:31.77]My soul blazes brighter.
[303:34.03]Tax collector.
[303:39.37]I have lived thousands of years, and will live thousands more.
[303:47.28]He's leaving.
[303:47.70]Okay, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone, he's gone!
[303:50.62]Your gold, your majesty!
[303:52.56]Let's go!
[303:54.36]Build, quick!
[303:56.48]Tax collector!
[304:01.23]I need, um, I can't build any of the guilds.
[304:03.39]I just... Tax collector!
[304:05.29]My soul blazes brighter!
[304:12.90]What the fuck am I supposed to do here?
[304:20.11]Why is there a werewolf over here?
[304:24.43]Why is there a werewolf in this town?
[304:27.33]I don't know.
[304:28.65]This is just not fair.
[304:30.01]It's not fair.
[304:31.21]What on earth are you doing here with this bullshit?
[304:40.15]They just sound tired.
[304:42.06]What's this doing?
[304:42.88]What's this doing?
[304:43.68]Why is it spinning?
[304:45.48]Sunscorch?
[305:09.01]I'm out of money.
[305:13.65]All right.
[305:14.31]Can somebody go up there?
[305:15.77]It's been a $400 bounty to go up there since I started the game.
[305:38.90]There's a chest.
[305:40.38]Open it.
[305:41.16]Open the chest.
[305:42.78]There's like five of them.
[305:44.70]Finally.
[305:46.90]Are you actually gonna go up this way?
[305:49.04]What the hell?
[306:07.27]What the hell?
[306:07.81]Get it.
[306:08.29]Open the treasure, please.
[306:09.55]Here he comes.
[306:09.97]There he is.
[306:11.13]No, it's not.
[306:29.55]That's one of the many sons or daughters, I guess.
[306:31.85]Level five, though.

[310:10.23]Yeah?
[310:11.43]Where are they?
[310:12.13]Here, in the library.
[310:12.91]He's at level 30.
[310:13.37]I gotta track this guy.
[310:14.17]Oh, give me a fucking break.
[310:15.67]Did I seriously just pull him?
[310:34.41]I just pulled him.
[310:35.27]His entire crew.
[310:38.67]Alright, everybody attack it.
[310:42.25]Where's he going?
[310:43.67]Which town is he going to?
[310:46.59]Wait, what?
[310:52.15]Kill the dragon.
[310:55.27]I have a bunch of level 30s and shit.
[310:56.81]Everybody get in here.
[310:59.73]Kill it.
[311:00.98]Kill it.
[311:10.15]Oh, I need the sword.
[311:11.69]Damn it.
[311:13.34]No, that's 2100 bucks.
[311:17.24]No, I forgot about the sword.
[311:20.78]I forgot about the fucking sword.
[311:23.28]Alright.
[311:26.96]Ah.
[311:28.98]What a waste of money.
[311:30.59]I'm so pissed off right now about that.
[311:33.95]Stupid fucking sword.
[311:42.96]I forgot about the dumb sword It's just somewhere on this map too this sucks Blessings to the Phoenix
[312:05.59]I'm out of money now, because I did that.
[312:07.37]I don't know why, but for some reason I thought I could entice the level 30s to come over and start killing it, but yeah, yeah.
[312:13.51]Like you, for instance, you're dead now.
[312:15.45]Give me speed, Lunard!
[312:19.25]And then I lost my trading post anyway, so this is just a wash at this point, so... It's kind of just over, but... Still here.
[312:32.24]Give me speed, Lunard!
[312:38.93]I don't want to go looking around with this shit.
[312:40.90]I don't want to go looking around with this.
[312:44.74]This is a big level.
[312:45.68]Big sword.
[312:46.84]Unless it's in here.
[312:47.94]If it's in here, then I'm going to go.
[312:49.22]I'll do it.
[312:57.60]Fire strike?
[312:58.16]No.
[312:58.76]Why would I even attack him?
[313:00.74]He eventually goes away, right?
[313:05.31]Sword.
[313:05.97]Not in there.
[313:06.99]Big sword, small voice.
[313:08.13]Do I throw in the towel?
[313:32.71]I think it's time to throw the towel in.
[313:34.62]I lost to level 20.
[313:36.74]No one's listening to me anymore.
[313:38.24]Well, this person is.
[313:40.86]Dwight.
[313:42.97]Alright, Dwight.
[313:44.91]Will you find the legendary sword?
[313:51.05]Doesn't look like it.
[314:04.38]I have lived thousands of years and will live thousands more.
[314:13.17]Where are you going?
[314:16.99]Leave.
[314:19.99]Who are these people?
[314:20.65]Tax collector.
[314:24.20]Alright, somebody go.
[314:25.38]Alright, Dwight.
[314:26.30]Dwight's going for it again.
[314:29.08]Where you at, Dwight?
[314:33.68]Did Dwight die?
[314:34.50]I think Dwight's dead.
[314:37.36]Oh, there he is.
[314:40.48]I was gonna do it, but then I got attacked.
[314:44.03]I got scared.
[314:51.27]What's that?
[314:52.19]Oh, a dead body.
[314:53.19]Oh, fucking so dead.
[315:03.84]Nobody's taking it up on that offer.
[315:05.98]Alright, maybe 800 will do it.
[315:07.26]Someone will run out there.
[315:10.54]The town's dead?
[315:11.36]Yeah.
[315:11.80]I mean, this whole... This run is done.
[315:14.98]The only way this run is saved is if somebody accidentally stumbles across the sword and I throw it at the dragon and kill it.
[315:23.83]Alright, Dwight, you get 1500 bucks.
[315:25.07]Hurry up.
[315:27.15]Where you at, Dwight?
[315:32.57]He wants to leave.
[315:34.82]Someone just threw dirt in his face.
[315:41.13]How is he still alive, Dwight?
[315:45.55]It says he's en route.
[315:47.28]Don't ask me why he's not there yet.
[315:49.00]Do I even have any heroes left?
[315:53.28]I'm not sure there's even any heroes.
[315:59.27]No, I don't have any heroes.
[316:08.26]Throw it in the cell.
[316:12.52]Alright, let's do one more scenario.
[316:14.14]I think that'll take us to the end here.
[316:19.26]Clash of Empires.
[316:25.85]Ultimate Sphere of Power.
[316:30.51]The Valley of the Serpents.
[316:36.63]Why would this one be Beginner?
[316:42.40]The siege?
[316:49.89]Should I try it?
[316:50.39]Let's see what happens.
[316:55.65]I'm gonna go for it.
[317:00.89]Majesty, our battle with the hostile and barbaric kingdom of Borgin the Conqueror has brought us to a siege of his stronghold.
[317:08.47]We must either force his surrender by blockading his supply caravans, or storm his fortress and take it by force.
[317:15.92]Our challenge is complicated by our local wizard's guild, which has chosen to side with Borgin's forces.
[317:22.82]Still, I feel we can prevail if you act decisively.
[317:37.73]Okay, what's the plan?
[317:38.24]Okay.
[317:39.04]What do I got in the front here?
[317:40.96]Guard houses.
[317:41.40]Upgrade them immediately.
[318:05.20]Okay, what do I have?
[318:08.42]Can I do paladins?
[318:09.18]That's what I'm going to do.
[318:13.88]I can nudge up now.
[318:16.91]I'm going to lift a warrior's guild here.
[318:21.19]Let's do some warriors.
[318:23.69]I can't do any temples.
[318:25.25]No temples.
[318:27.81]Uh-oh.
[318:28.21]Well, shit.
[318:31.02]Blacksmith, get it out.
[318:32.28]No.
[318:34.35]I fucking didn't see it.
[318:38.77]I need to build some more shit over here.
[318:48.48]Should I do a line of towers?
[318:52.40]I'm thinking at least a few towers in each slot.
[318:55.94]Right?
[318:56.98]But that makes sense, doesn't it?
[319:07.46]All right need some more uh knights just build 25 towers might not be a bad idea It's kind of half versus half and it's this is their uh, they're gonna have a Warriors guild who are these people?
[319:37.42]Are they going to give me money?
[319:38.96]Are we going to be friends?
[319:40.52]Because it looks like we might be friends here.
[319:44.52]Alright, I'm okay with this.
[319:45.38]I might have a friend.
[319:50.07]Are they bad?
[319:50.85]They are.
[319:51.47]Damn it, they're bad.
[320:06.82]That might have been good.
[320:11.59]Apparently not.
[320:16.77]Turns out it was not a bad idea.
[320:19.04]To do the double blood up here.
[320:26.78]Help.
[320:31.19]Help me.
[320:31.87]What are you doing?
[320:37.09]What is wrong with you?
[320:38.25]Why would you go over here?
[320:39.29]There's no reason to do this right now.
[320:41.23]You're just walking right into the front door of their base.
[320:49.62]You're so dumb.
[320:50.58]No, call back you is what I'm doing.
[321:04.51]Okay, that's good.
[321:12.45]Okay, let's get some more gnomes.
[321:15.97]Don't even have to go to level two yet.
[321:17.71]I need a couple of trading posts.
[321:24.18]Okay.
[321:26.00]I don't... Let me get one healer, two healers.
[321:29.20]And then... I'm gonna do a trading post over here.
[321:35.05]Did I not do a trading post?
[321:36.95]What?
[321:37.99]That's not good.
[321:38.51]That's really bad.
[321:44.18]I can't make a trading post.
[321:52.14]The radar fog looks like a spider.
[321:54.35]I mean, I was going to say it looks like a bear with a jetpack on with his knees and his legs kicked up and he's flying forward.
[322:04.28]Uh, where are we going?
[322:13.27]Up here.
[322:16.65]I can't make a trading post?
[322:17.82]How the fuck am I supposed to make any money?
[322:23.00]I'm just gonna spam knights.
[322:27.40]I think that's what the plan is here, is just spam knights.
[322:33.38]Go in now.
[322:34.32]Get in.
[322:34.62]Go in.
[322:35.36]Go.
[322:36.42]Get in, everybody.
[322:37.32]My prowess is unmatched.
[322:38.96]Get in there.
[322:40.94]If they're stupid enough to do this, then we might be able just to take this now.
[322:48.04]Did I go in the building?
[322:55.41]My prowess is unmatched.
[323:01.44]Look at how many are here.
[323:02.42]Wait, is this mine or theirs?
[323:05.16]No, it's mine.
[323:12.06]I think I can do this right now.
[323:21.56]They might just do it.
[323:23.83]I could go up to the caravan.
[323:28.19]People are kind of flooding in.
[323:29.43]Let's see what happens.
[323:35.24]uh guys guys what are you doing fellas um might just be able to overwhelm them I'm on my way no they have skeletons where'd you get the skeletons from who the hell is this
[324:01.97]It would be great if they... These guys are idiots.
[324:07.15]So, you want to know what happened there.
[324:08.51]That's really cool.
[324:11.39]So, they... They... They spent the time to... Oh, go attack this thing if you feel like it.
[324:20.85]No, no.
[324:21.41]We're going to all walk down here while taking damage and then turn around and walk this way and die.
[324:32.53]The gnomes are the only ones doing anything.
[324:41.05]Well, um... Okay.
[324:46.44]Didn't help at all.
[324:48.42]And now I have no more warriors.
[324:50.34]And there goes all the money.
[325:00.53]What is going on?
[325:01.25]Why is this 500 bucks to attack my own building?
[325:06.17]What?
[325:07.42]Why do I have this here?
[325:11.98]Why do I have this here?
[325:13.46]Is that their bounty?
[325:14.72]What?
[325:20.10]That's the enemy's bounty.
[325:22.90]Oh, shit.
[325:25.80]Stop.
[325:26.18]Ah.
[325:30.51]Oh, this is it.
[325:31.11]This is bad.
[325:33.05]Bad, bad, bad.
[325:34.03]Here's the kind of counterattack.
[325:38.13]What is this?
[325:39.30]What's a rat bullshit?
[325:42.46]I hate this.
[325:43.80]In a game where you don't have any control over anybody, let's spawn rats in your base all the time.
[325:48.52]Why?
[325:49.04]My prowess is unmatched.
[326:03.26]I'm gonna lose.
[326:07.46]I have no guard houses?
[326:09.64]I did.
[326:10.00]They would lose one here.
[326:11.72]I don't want like just rats to spawn in my base because I made more buildings.
[326:22.99]I'm not even gonna be able to take this.
[326:24.23]I'm not even certain what's going on over here.
[326:34.40]So the goblins are attacking them too, right?
[326:37.68]Why wouldn't we work together and get the goblins out of here?
[326:45.53]Well, delaying the inevitable, let's game over.
[326:56.39]Your Majesty, we have intercepted very few of Borden's caravans over the last few days.
[326:59.85]Our spies report that his gold reserve is in excess of 40,000 gold.
[327:09.67]That's it.
[327:10.81]I'm not doing that again.
[327:18.12]He had way too much money.
[327:19.02]He had so much more money.
[327:30.48]The Siege Expert.
[327:32.14]Not gonna happen.
[327:35.91]Hey, thank you, JermaSucks, for the five community subs.
[327:39.03]I appreciate it.
[327:39.55]Thanks for the five subs.
[327:41.61]Let's do this one.
[327:44.04]Okay.
[327:44.40]Alright.
[328:13.26]Destroy the four slave pits.
[328:15.35]Kill Earl Sheck, the three-headed beast.
[328:27.04]I can try.
[328:27.44]Alright, we got a guild.
[328:29.28]We need guardhouses.
[328:31.86]At least one or two.
[328:32.52]I want a marketplace.
[328:34.74]Quick.
[328:36.02]Let's get a ranger's guild.
[328:38.65]Over here?
[328:39.75]No, like... I need some exploration here.
[328:44.51]A birdhouse?
[328:46.95]Did I say birdhouse?
[328:49.74]I didn't say birdhouse, did I?
[329:01.03]Get that built.
[329:02.01]Hurry, please.
[329:05.97]Marketplace going up.
[329:07.71]Let's get a rogue out here.
[329:08.49]Okay.
[329:08.69]So far, so good.
[329:09.15]I need a ranger's guild.
[329:10.41]Good.
[329:32.04]Appreciate that.
[329:32.74]Okay.
[329:37.06]No more gnomes.
[329:39.60]I need, let's do another, let's do a warrior's guild.
[329:42.35]Get the marketplace level two.
[329:45.95]Your majesty, we've improved the birdhouse.
[330:01.18]That was a good one.
[330:01.70]I like that one.
[330:05.28]Hard place level two.
[330:15.25]I have all my range.
[330:17.49]Good.
[330:18.19]Get some rangers.
[330:19.23]I need money.
[330:34.68]I have zero dollars, but I have, like, I have, like, eight people.
[330:39.51]Got a guard tower here.
[330:40.61]Where's the sewer?
[330:41.19]Because I want to put a... All right, good.
[330:43.33]Explore.
[330:43.65]Treasure chest.
[330:45.47]Get it.
[330:46.69]Eighty dollars.
[330:47.27]What a worthless treasure chest.
[330:50.84]All right.
[330:51.78]Thanks for the money.
[330:55.10]Let's get... Let's get a warrior.
[330:58.28]Let's do all warriors from here on out.
[331:04.16]I need to explore.
[331:07.56]Head down here.
[331:12.16]It's worth it for you to go down there.
[331:13.48]What's going on here?
[331:16.27]Alright, fight, fight.
[331:19.11]There's like fucking eight of you here.
[331:20.35]What's going on, everybody?
[331:21.09]Fight.
[331:24.95]There's like ten of you.
[331:26.41]What are you doing?
[331:27.03]Fight them.
[331:27.43]Here we go.
[331:27.78]Twenty-six hundred bucks.
[331:33.87]The queen of a nearby kingdom has sent you a healthy sum of gold and pleads with you to help find out what has happened to some of her missing subjects.
[331:39.32]What are you talking about?
[331:41.88]Where's this person?
[331:42.52]Okay, I got plenty of people.
[332:05.59]Where's my blacksmith?
[332:06.31]Do I have a blacksmith yet?
[332:07.61]I think it is a sewer.
[332:16.74]Get a couple over here by the sewer.
[332:22.92]I need to get... Good, finally, you're on your way over there.
[332:25.74]It took you long enough.
[332:27.72]No, don't just...
[332:37.02]Okay.
[332:37.52]Good.
[332:37.68]I have, I have all my heroes full.
[332:39.24]Good.
[332:39.44]Trading post over here.
[332:44.80]Find something, find anything.
[333:08.13]Find anything.
[333:08.89]There's nothing down here.
[333:09.83]I thought there was a neighboring kingdom.
[333:17.57]There's nothing here.
[333:18.18]I guess until you find something.
[333:29.32]I don't have any money.
[333:30.76]Oh, found something.
[333:31.50]What'd you find?
[333:33.75]An unwelcome guest.
[333:36.03]Slave pit.
[333:39.06]Take it out.
[333:44.18]Uh-oh.
[333:47.54]Uh-oh.
[333:48.37]Okay, guys, guys, guys, guys.
[333:49.47]There's a lot on here.
[333:51.63]An unwelcome guest.
[333:53.39]I found one, but I gotta go back.
[333:56.77]I need to level up the marketplace again.
[333:58.81]And then I need to put a trading post over here somewhere.
[334:02.23]There's a whole town here.
[334:03.77]Can you guys handle this?
[334:06.19]No.
[334:06.25]You can't handle it.
[334:06.87]It's okay.
[334:07.29]You did.
[334:07.61]Where?
[334:30.15]Well, get back up there.
[334:35.63]Throw everybody in the pit.
[334:37.99]Where the fuck did you come from?
[334:43.35]How did you even get in here?
[334:44.21]Did you come out of the sewer?
[334:47.91]The queen of the nearby kingdom has again sent you some of her gold to aid in your search for missing heroes.
[334:54.17]She will no longer be able to aid you because the goblins are making a heavy intrusion.
[335:00.68]Well, that's not good.
[335:06.59]Just kill this thing, please.
[335:08.91]Alright, what do we got?
[335:15.12]Take it out!
[335:16.30]If you're fine, take it out!
[335:17.56]Take it out!
[335:19.06]You're standing next to it.
[335:20.90]500 bucks to overtake that.
[335:22.16]Do it!
[335:24.52]It's just sitting right in front of you.
[335:28.23]There we go, nice.
[335:30.86]Trading post.
[335:33.20]Good shit.
[335:34.16]Good, I have a trading post now up there.
[335:37.70]Didn't even need to build one.
[335:39.12]Alright.
[335:39.54]Uh, guard house.
[335:40.34]Let's do another guard house right here.
[335:43.52]You guys good?
[336:04.22]Alright, doing some uncharted territory up there.
[336:08.85]What happens when I destroy this?
[336:11.19]Okay.
[336:14.81]You've destroyed a slave pit and freed the nearby slaves, and now I got all these people, and that I just won.
[336:20.32]That's immediate, instant recruits.
[336:29.38]Pretty sick.
[336:30.04]Okay, um...
[336:33.40]Alright, get everybody back to town.
[336:34.93]What's up here?
[336:36.67]I'm going to build a trading post down there.
[336:43.27]Let's get a little village over here.
[336:53.54]Don't just go up there.
[336:54.34]What are you thinking?
[336:56.50]Don't do that.
[337:00.26]Nothing down here at all.
[337:01.00]That's because everything's in the top left.
[337:05.58]Trading post there, trading post over here.
[337:12.36]How much money do I got?
[337:13.18]I need this level two palace.
[337:16.46]For God's sake.
[337:18.24]Another trading route.
[337:37.11]I miss the old German who used to eat baby food and shit his diapers.
[337:40.31]There we go.
[337:40.77]Good, good.
[337:41.59]Alright, more money.
[337:42.65]Level 2 palace.
[338:04.87]Mmm, you're just going for it.
[338:06.20]They're going for it.
[338:09.10]Don't get too overzealous.
[338:10.14]There's a whole entire kingdom up here.
[338:11.70]They're all running away.
[338:16.40]Don't just run away.
[338:19.74]Keep the paladin alive.
[338:32.36]I don't want to start attacking shit.
[338:34.40]Come on.
[338:34.90]There's another one.
[338:38.04]All right, we'll do it.
[338:40.73]Take it out.
[338:41.51]More recruits.
[338:45.87]We're good.
[338:59.72]I think they can get it by themselves here.
[339:02.82]Yeah, they'll get it.
[339:08.24]One dollar.
[339:16.37]Nice.
[339:18.27]Uh, that was Shevus the Awfully Mad.
[339:20.97]What do we got for items?
[339:22.81]Ultra Chaos Blades get 19 plus 1.
[339:26.25]This guy can probably play the rest of the game fine.
[339:33.89]Let's see what we get from this.
[339:40.95]Guys, I'm putting another trading post up here.
[339:42.41]You better believe it.
[339:44.49]Nice.
[339:47.98]Even more.
[339:49.38]Looking good.
[339:52.24]Get a trading post.
[339:53.02]Get it up there.
[339:53.92]Oh, yeah.
[339:54.92]I'm excited about this one.
[340:02.43]Right here.
[340:04.92]Bingo.
[340:08.32]There's a lot of things over here.
[340:15.05]I think it's still... Okay, they're going to attack.
[340:19.41]We need to be not so spread out.
[340:20.77]They're coming in from the north right now.
[340:24.37]Hello, everybody.
[340:26.39]Come over here.
[340:27.59]And just start... Start killing things.
[340:35.60]Start fighting over here.
[340:36.86]Because... Here we go.
[340:47.93]Start fighting.
[340:48.71]I need... We're so spread out.
[340:50.27]Look at how many people I have, but they're too spread out.
[340:54.81]Your Majesty, the royal treasury is nearly empty.
[340:59.13]We're good?
[340:59.89]Energies of light.
[341:02.19]Oh, fuck.
[341:03.13]Okay.
[341:04.69]Did they kill everything up here?
[341:05.71]I had... Oh, my God.
[341:06.55]I didn't even see this.
[341:08.18]I didn't even see this happening.
[341:17.68]I need everybody over here.
[341:23.16]Bring everybody back here, quick.
[341:25.66]Please!
[341:35.39]In the name of the sovereign!
[341:47.40]We're gonna be fine.
[341:50.32]I have so many units.
[341:53.94]They're all slowly but surely.
[341:55.49]I have another post up here, too.
[341:58.69]And, by the way, we're going right up the front door after this.
[342:09.41]Go right up the front door.
[342:14.01]Palace level three.
[342:23.94]Send everybody up here.
[342:25.96]Thousand bucks.
[342:26.52]This is a counterattack situation.
[342:34.93]Fairgrounds.
[342:35.95]I can do temple of... What's one I haven't done?
[342:38.61]Crypto?
[342:42.96]I think I'm going to do Crypto.
[342:51.24]Sounds like a plan.
[342:57.35]Don't spread out.
[342:58.31]Go right in.
[342:58.75]BTC back at 12k.
[343:12.74]Oh, sick!
[343:18.00]Keep going.
[343:19.74]Keep going, keep going, keep going.
[343:22.51]This is gonna be the end.
[343:25.01]I'm gonna complete it right here.
[343:26.51]It's game over here.
[343:28.29]Yeah, this is game over.
[343:28.93]Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is gonna be game over here.
[343:42.42]Is there any more?
[343:50.14]There's one more little time.
[343:54.59]Item of holy significance.
[343:56.47]This is it.
[344:11.94]You guys just start saying it.
[344:12.88]Just say this is game over.
[344:14.45]Until the game ends.
[344:22.37]I think this might be game over here.
[344:28.54]Found it.
[344:30.88]An unwelcome guest.
[344:40.00]Where is it?
[344:44.30]Get it!
[344:45.92]Keep going, it's right here somewhere.
[344:47.72]The final hole.
[344:51.56]Can we die?
[344:53.25]Oh, well, you killed that, please.
[345:02.53]There's a lot of minotaurs up here.
[345:05.47]Go!
[345:07.39]More people get up there.
[345:08.27]I want everyone to be going this way.
[345:10.61]This is where the last thing is.
[345:14.41]Who's going to get the three grand?
[345:27.38]There it is.
[345:28.18]Final slave area to get.
[345:31.44]Socivaru.
[345:33.10]Energies of light.
[345:34.42]Socivaru.
[345:35.20]Problem?
[345:36.10]The unholy are near.
[345:37.54]To oblivion.
[345:39.26]Call in the reinforcements.
[345:41.83]Socivaru.
[345:42.91]Did it.
[345:43.29]My prowess is unmatched.
[345:45.11]Forty-two, forty-three, forty-four hundred dollars.
[345:47.95]Whoever kills this.
[345:49.45]Oh, Jesus.
[345:50.11]What if I... What the hell?
[345:51.71]Oops.
[345:52.43]One step closer.
[345:53.91]To oblivion.
[345:55.60]That's a lot of money just to walk in a circle.
[346:03.19]Very cool.
[346:03.53]GG.
[346:04.15]These things are awesome.
[346:05.05]You destroyed... What is left?
[346:06.35]Am I missing something here?
[346:08.05]The whole... I can see everything.
[346:10.87]What do I have to do?
[346:38.93]Oh, it's this thing!
[346:43.52]Kill it!
[346:47.22]Everybody, stack!
[346:49.56]He's just coming to kill- he's coming into my town!
[346:54.53]Uhh...
[346:58.33]This music is way... Holy shit.
[347:00.63]Okay, kill it.
[347:02.81]Everybody, please.
[347:13.71]He's kind of killing everybody.
[347:24.45]Get over here.
[347:25.57]Everybody needs to stack right now.
[347:35.62]Energies of light!
[347:40.02]No shit!
[347:42.78]We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[347:43.84]Everything's fine, everything's fine.
[347:48.20]Who's gonna get the big, big payout?
[347:52.60]I'd love to be the one person that's not on this list of heroes that doesn't care about the 16,000 dollars.
[347:58.95]Energies of light!
[348:02.52]I'm gonna walk this way.
[348:04.40]Perfect.
[348:04.64]Yeah.
[348:04.98]Nice.
[348:05.20]Let's see what the end credits say.
[348:23.16]What?
[348:23.44]That's not good.
[348:24.18]Excellent.
[348:24.68]Awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome.
[348:55.50]Is this the Hearthstone guy?
[348:57.80]Me?
[348:58.02]I did play Hearthstone once.
[349:05.55]And it was a very, very embarrassing stream.
[349:10.09]I think that's a good place to call it.
[349:12.51]Right at the six hour mark.
[349:13.55]I think that's a good place to go.
[349:21.32]So, I've got to tell you.
[349:25.63]That was pretty fun.
[349:27.81]It was a little, you know, just, it was cool.
[349:33.31]I vaguely remember playing this a long, long time ago, vaguely, and not understanding what to do, and I still didn't.
[349:41.23]But no, that was fun.
[349:44.39]So, I have a list of games that I would like to play over this next few days.
[349:51.87]And those games are gonna be
[349:55.52]Where the hell are they?
[349:57.71]Oh, also, this weekend, I'm going to give some details on that Highlights Activity Book stream.
[350:07.38]We're going to lock down kind of how that's going to play out.
[350:12.18]GTA Online, I want to get some friends together for that, so I don't really know when that's going to happen, but it should be fairly soon.
[350:19.90]Also, there's not going to be a stream tomorrow.
[350:23.95]I know.
[350:25.55]I have so many things to do tomorrow that I just can't.
[350:30.13]This is not going to happen.
[350:32.29]But, on Saturday and Sunday, we will go extra long.
[350:40.95]Saturday and Sunday will be very long streams.
[350:45.25]We'll probably play at least a couple games on each of those streams.
[350:51.41]Not 24 hours.
[350:54.31]But those streams will probably be at least 8 to 10 hours long, I would say.
[350:58.57]Because there's a lot of games that I have queued up that I want to play.
[351:04.66]But I was going to stream tomorrow, but there's way too much shit to do.
[351:11.84]There was just nowhere I was going to be able to do it.
[351:17.36]So, I'll see you guys on Saturday and Sunday.
[351:20.85]We'll do a weekend, a long weekend thing.
[351:24.35]The games list is... Let me just go over here.
[351:26.26]Let's turn this off.
[351:32.44]Exit game.
[351:33.04]I thought that was fun.
[351:35.13]Once you understand how the actual game works, it's kind of interesting to see what they do.
[351:39.47]I wish there was a little more variables and variants to what they did, but we're also talking about a game that came out in 2000.
[351:48.43]So I have... where's my list?
[351:51.55]I'm gonna go over a list of things that I'm gonna do.
[352:00.90]I want to try to get this game, Ripper, to work.
[352:05.23]It's an old FMV game with Christopher Walken and I think like Paul Giamatti.
[352:11.23]It's an absurd FMV game that I want to try on Saturday.
[352:16.98]I also have ordered and should be here in the next few days.
[352:20.82]This is not going to happen this weekend.
[352:24.07]Actually, no, that's a little bit of a surprise.
[352:26.13]I won't talk about that.
[352:26.95]But there's going to be something fucked up that you'll see on this stream in the next few days.
[352:34.79]Green screen?
[352:36.59]No.
[352:41.43]There's also that new From Software game that came out.
[352:48.13]The mech one?
[352:48.91]What's it called?
[352:49.37]Metal Wolf Chaos?
[352:54.94]It looked interesting.
[352:55.98]I kind of wanted to play it.
[352:56.68]Is it bad?
[353:02.46]Is it worth playing?
[353:03.20]It's really bad.
[353:08.98]Really bad?
[353:15.55]Well, that's on the list.
[353:17.73]I have maximum action.
[353:20.53]Maybe I'll see if I can get a few friends to play Half Dead 2.
[353:22.71]That game looks ridiculous.
[353:29.33]Maximum action is that... Okay, I'm just freaking out right now because on my Steam list...
[353:45.74]While I was saying these names, it was putting them in a different category, and I was like, what the fuck is happening?
[353:51.12]They were going from today to yesterday.
[353:54.79]And it was happening as I was clicking them.
[353:57.81]But it's because it's midnight now.
[354:00.19]No, this is weird.
[354:01.85]Why?
[354:02.05]Hold on, I'm going to say something here.
[354:07.89]Yesterday, this week, this month.
[354:09.57]What is going on right now?
[354:13.83]It's moving all my shit around.
[354:20.25]Anyways.
[354:22.01]Yeah.
[354:22.85]So there's a lot of things I want to do.
[354:27.28]Over this weekend, we will hammer down the details on the highlight stream.
[354:31.04]There's a few other streams that are going to happen for that carnival.
[354:38.55]That might be really fun.
[354:41.78]But let's go back six hours ago.
[354:44.38]Let's do the bits and throw those subs up.
[354:53.84]Earlier we had... Freudian Weapon came in with $2.50.
[355:01.05]Thank you, Freudian.
[355:02.03]Welcome back.
[355:02.49]Hope all is well.
[355:03.17]Happy Thursday.

[356:08.60]Thanks for filling the hole with dumb jokes.
[356:11.00]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[356:20.29]Rest in peace to your cat.
[356:22.79]Hopefully... Your cat lived a very long and loved life.
[356:27.13]Because that's what you can do is you remember...
[356:34.34]How much you loved each other.
[356:39.56]Right?

[359:17.72]Oh, it's a good one.
[359:18.32]This was really heavily requested.
[359:21.00]I saw this pop up in the recommended channel at least probably three or four times over the course of the last year or something.
[359:29.05]Long time ago, people were saying to play this.
[359:32.83]So sometimes I just kind of scroll through and see what recommendations people want to see for a game and we just play them.
[359:48.65]Thank you to Fussroboto for the $4.
[359:52.91]Here's $2, $2, but you owe me 100,000% interest on this.
[359:57.55]Is this a loan?
[359:58.33]What is 100,000% interest on a $4 loan?
[359:59.73]Is that over a year?
[360:00.47]Is that a 10-year loan?
[360:01.17]Is that a 20-year loan?
[360:22.15]Quick, pay it.
[360:24.03]Pay it.
[360:25.11]If you pay it within five minutes, it's only going to be $9.12.
[360:28.89]Well, thank you for the $4 opportunity.
[360:36.98]No, just thanks for the $4.
[360:40.62]Y-D-N-A, thanks for the $10.
[360:43.18]Hey, Jerma, I've been going through a rough time recently.
[360:44.79]I just want to say that your streams have really kept me going.
[360:47.47]Thank you for brightening mine and everyone else's day.
[360:49.97]Jerma Hart.
[360:50.91]It's my pleasure.
[360:56.98]Thanks for allowing me to do this.
[361:00.52]Three, four times a week.
[361:08.72]Thank you for the ten bucks.
[361:10.18]And hopefully you get through whatever you're going through.
[361:16.13]You will.
[361:18.53]Thank you so much for the ten bucks.
[361:23.17]Four times a week, Kappa.
[361:24.49]No, I was.
[361:25.19]I was up until the carnival.
[361:31.66]Up until the Carnival stream really started to get work done on it, I was doing four times a week.
[361:41.85]Now it's been kind of brought down to like two or three.
[361:43.81]But all things... Patience.
[361:48.20]Patience.
[361:48.64]All things.
[361:50.38]You'll see.
[362:00.97]Despite your big projects, I always enjoy the small streams.
[362:03.42]I'm not going to stop doing that.
[362:07.58]I said that a long, long time ago.
[362:10.16]This is like probably two or three years ago.
[362:12.50]I said that I want to start to move more focus onto stuff that's not video games.
[362:19.51]I did say that.
[362:21.71]And slowly, I've been trying to find ways to make more interesting things potentially happen on streams.
[362:29.43]Not just playing a game or not just kind of hanging out.
[362:31.65]Trying to figure out what would be fun to do with like a live broadcast.
[362:45.09]And I think over the last year or two, I have been throwing in a lot of stuff that's not me just playing a game.
[363:00.08]But no, I don't think I'll ever not do stuff like this.
[363:06.31]Because I have fun just sitting here hanging out and talking.
[363:13.97]And you can't really do that with some of the streams that I've done in the past.
[363:23.17]It's fun just to talk and crack fucking jokes and have you guys, like, chime in and say shit.
[363:29.57]And it's fun.
[363:30.11]It's funny.
[363:32.09]I don't think this will stop.
[363:34.14]But I will definitely be putting more time and effort into that other side.
[363:48.98]really depending on how well this stream is received will be an indicator of how hard I want to pursue continuing down that road which I think I I I really don't see how this wouldn't be a really fun stream we'll see but thank you thank you apple ship for the 250.
[364:20.81]Hey man, this is going to be sappy, but you're kind of the best thing that's happened to my mental health in a really long time, and I want to say thank you for that.
[364:28.44]Your old TF2 commentary videos especially are indescribably comforting.
[364:32.79]I have PTSD, and it can be hard to calm myself down sometimes, but putting on one of those has been just what I needed recently.
[364:39.55]Sorry this is kind of long, but yeah, you help a lot more people in a lot more ways than you realize.
[364:42.96]Have a good one.
[364:49.47]That's moving in a million ways that I can't even express.
[364:55.10]I am so happy that people can get much more out of this than simply just, you know, watching and laughing and then that's it.
[365:18.76]If this helps, if it does, there's not much I can say.
[365:24.32]I'm so fucking glad that you have something here.
[365:37.74]Take care of yourself.
[365:42.82]Thanks for watching for as long as you have.
[365:45.99]I'm just going to keep trying to do things that people might think are fun.
[365:50.56]That's all I'm going to do.
[365:51.32]That's all I ever wanted to do, and that's all I'm going to continue to do.
[365:55.14]However you receive that is awesome to me.
[365:58.76]I'm really happy to hear it.
[366:07.05]But thank you for the $2.50, Apple Shift.
[366:12.51]Take care.
[366:16.54]We had a wave of subs and huge money that came in after that.
[366:23.02]We had $50 from Just Donate to Jerma.
[366:25.24]We had $50 from Akronda.
[366:27.42]Ten community subs from Nocturne.
[366:31.09]Jerma Sucks gave five subs.
[366:32.57]I'm not a big fan of your name, but thanks for the five subs.
[366:41.03]Thank you, Mireska, for the ten bucks.
[366:46.66]Just thousand bits.
[366:48.14]Thank you.
[366:51.60]Just dropping just 10 bucks and no message or anything.
[366:55.86]Thank you.
[366:56.69]I'm shocked and floored that people would even do that in the first place.
[366:59.93]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[367:04.83]Vachie Lala, thanks for the $5.
[367:06.75]Congrats on reaching a million subscribers on your main channel.
[367:09.78]What?
[367:10.10]That didn't happen.
[367:17.38]No, that didn't happen.
[367:18.32]If anything, people have probably been leaving that channel.
[367:25.66]No, that's not a million.
[367:31.36]I don't need some number to tell me how I'm doing.
[367:37.68]A million subs, it doesn't matter.
[367:39.25]I don't need some number to whisper in my ear that, oh, you did a million subs, you win.
[367:44.29]No, no, no, that's not how this works.
[367:57.67]Top 1,000 streamer.
[367:59.39]You know... I bet it's... Somebody just wrote 5-6.
[368:04.61]How do I... I'm deleting this person.
[368:05.75]It's gone.
[368:13.51]I just timed you up for 10 minutes.
[368:15.39]I thought it was going to be like 10 seconds.
[368:18.77]It's 10 minutes.
[368:19.70]Hahaha.
[368:24.39]I did do it.
[368:25.83]That was just a knee-jerk reaction.
[368:30.51]Ten minutes.
[368:32.74]Oh well.
[368:39.24]Stop!
[368:39.90]Stop!
[368:40.18]I don't want to start banning everybody!
[368:43.74]You know what you're doing.
[368:44.34]You know exactly what you're doing.
[368:51.85]You're not a knee-jerk, you're just a regular jerk.
[369:05.21]I just shook my head side to side.
[369:06.67]You could probably hear it.
[369:11.87]But thank you, uh... Thank you, Spicy Mexican Taco, for the 30 cents.
[369:20.26]I'm not supposed to read that.
[369:24.98]They wrote, if I donate 30 bits, will German read a third of my message?
[369:28.22]Fuck.
[369:28.68]Why?
[369:30.96]Why did I do that?
[369:31.74]I'm not supposed to read these.
[369:37.58]Like, that was... I'm not even... That's not even close for what I'm supposed to read.
[369:45.12]Walrus Incarnation next to the $10 right at the very end here.
[369:47.50]Hey, it's Walrus again.
[369:48.26]You're great, and I'm a longtime fan.
[369:50.56]Really hope I can make the Carnival stream.
[369:52.92]If you can, awesome.
[369:54.20]If you can't, then it'll be a VOD.
[369:56.82]There'll be a lot of places to watch it.
[369:58.08]Hopefully you can participate.
[370:00.39]If you can't, then you can enjoy it later on.
[370:03.73]It should be a fun rewatch.
[370:06.85]Also, thank you, Wing.
[370:07.83]Thanks for the three bucks, Wing.
[370:09.01]Are you planning on the Bionic Boomer stream still?
[370:11.41]Also, what's the best Dark Souls item?
[370:15.17]The Estus.
[370:21.32]Bionic Boomer.
[370:24.64]Kind of evolved into this stream, I think.
[370:31.00]The robot shit sort of evolved into...
[370:36.43]from a lot of different ideas at the same time.
[370:42.76]It would have to come later, much later.
[370:50.79]I have not forgot about it.
[370:51.69]It's, hey, it's still listed on, okay, I'm gonna, let's go over, um, I, I have my, my streams ideas, uh, I just have, like, a little notepad over here.
[371:01.21]I'm just gonna read it, uh, out loud just to you, okay, we got an easy bake oven stream, uh, custom family feud with chats answers, the community, uh, gives answers, and we do a live family feud, uh,
[371:14.26]Hire an actor to be Jerma while I sit in and coach them.
[371:18.94]I can keep going.
[371:19.66]The Bionic Boomer stream, the ASMR stream.
[371:30.12]There's like 30 more of those listed down here.
[371:37.45]You don't think I got shit going on.
[371:39.21]Come on.
[371:41.99]Spoilers?
[371:42.49]That's not a spoiler.
[371:44.23]You're gonna know that's gonna happen.
[371:45.67]The second that happens, you're gonna fucking know it's happening.
[371:55.45]More?
[371:55.93]No, I'm not gonna do that.
[371:58.31]Read them all.
[371:58.77]That's not gonna happen.
[371:59.65]You got, like, 0.2% of all the things that might be in the process of being made.
[372:09.56]Custom family feud.
[372:11.80]Where, you know, top 100 things that people said in Discord.
[372:15.54]That's gonna take a lot of interesting planning, but I wanna do that live.
[372:20.70]Like, with, um... Two families.
[372:25.14]Hire, like, just two full families to come in.
[372:37.62]Like, how are they even gonna know?
[372:42.93]How much would that cost?
[372:44.55]It doesn't matter.
[372:48.61]A lot.
[372:58.98]Did you like Majesty?
[372:59.82]Yes, I did.
[373:02.82]Let's get the subs on here.
[373:04.44]I will see you guys on Saturday.
[373:06.74]Nothing tomorrow.
[373:08.93]I've got a lot of fucking things going on.
[373:11.99]I'm trying to juggle them all at the same time.
[373:15.35]And so far, I'm doing pretty damn good juggling some shit.
[373:21.64]I'm not just juggling three pins here.
[373:25.64]I got, like, probably seven or eight chainsaws that I'm juggling.
[373:30.92]And I'm not missing a beat right now.
[373:32.37]And there's a lot going on.
[373:33.65]So, there's a lot of subs that are about to show up here, too.
[373:45.21]Is Terraria still going to be Saturday?
[373:46.81]Oh, damn.
[373:48.17]Probably, yeah.
[373:53.19]But the thing about Terraria is once, um... That could be part of it, yeah.
[373:59.69]Once Star is kind of done playing, which after usually about five or half, five hours or so, six hours or so, we can move on to something else.
[374:06.22]Because I'll be around for a long time on Saturday.
[374:11.32]We'll do a nice, big, chunky stream on Saturday.
[374:20.34]We could move on to DOS after that, too.
[374:23.94]Or Sunday.
[374:24.60]Do Sunday on DOS.
[374:25.60]Do some of the... Yeah.
[374:27.94]The gates are open.
[374:29.18]There's lots of stuff we can do.
[374:34.82]It'll be a juicy month.
[374:39.91]Scarce Saturdays.
[374:40.65]Didn't a new horror game just come out on Steam?
[374:47.27]I swear there was one that came out.
[374:54.17]I don't know if it's any good, but... Worth a shot, maybe.
[375:02.23]I just saw a sub-name.
[375:04.87]I was hungry until I saw the name.
[375:07.26]And now I'm not hungry anymore.
[375:11.72]I was really, really hungry.
[375:14.84]I don't... I... I'm gonna go to bed without eating now, somehow.
[375:28.26]What was the name?
[375:29.16]I'm not going to even repeat it.
[375:36.49]I made some chicken?
[375:37.19]Hey, thanks.
[375:43.05]Why are people getting nuked?
[375:44.11]I don't know.
[375:46.53]But we have... Do we have any more bits?
[375:47.79]No, we got them all.
[375:50.54]Wait, wait, wait, watch this, watch this, watch this, watch this, watch this, watch, watch, watch, watch this.
[375:56.04]Don't ignore the link.
[375:56.90]Stop it.
[375:57.20]I'm not ignoring the link.
[376:00.66]Look, when somebody puts a link in the chat, I don't just click immediately.
[376:03.25]What is this?
[376:05.85]Oh, click it, quick.
[376:10.87]Alright, this is called A Sad Story.
[376:14.79]Germa Animated.
[376:18.13]What is this?
[376:24.35]Hold on.
[376:25.19]Let's get this on the screen.
[376:30.01]This has 150,000 views.
[376:37.14]This is 150,000 views for something that was uploaded like fucking yesterday.
[376:40.86]Today.
[376:41.20]Let's take a look.
[376:56.36]This is called Sad Story.
[377:05.80]Hold up.
[377:06.60]I don't want YouTube fucking premium.
[377:16.84]Hold on.
[377:17.20]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[377:19.10]Let me tell you.
[377:27.19]I hate fucking internet.
[377:44.60]I fucking hate the internet.
[377:45.52]All right, here we go.
[377:52.54]Ready?
[377:53.46]Three, two, one.
[378:03.28]Let me tell you a sad story.
[378:09.48]There was once a young boy who was not well liked.
[378:12.96]The older his friends became, the more bitter his hatred escalated.
[378:17.72]Every day they were beaten up so badly, he lost half of his face.
[378:22.81]His eyes were swollen shut and he was covered in bandages.
[378:26.59]To see how he really felt was beyond words.
[378:28.49]What?
[378:29.41]And every time it seemed they could just keep going, the punishment would get worse.
[378:33.74]One day a woman stopped in to buy some bread.
[378:36.88]He didn't listen to her.
[378:38.43]He didn't seem to care.
[378:39.99]What?
[378:40.91]Then one day he walked right into her bedroom.
[378:44.35]She screamed and ran out screaming.
[378:46.61]What?
[378:46.81]The next morning she said to her parents, I don't know what I did to him.
[378:49.60]You're useless.
[378:53.90]He just stood there and didn't even move.
[378:56.44]All the while the old man tried to comfort him.
[378:59.51]Then one day there was some sort of accident.
[379:02.22]A boy was playing with his friends and the big wooden hammer fell on one of his friends and knocked him down as well.
[379:10.08]At the hospital, a nurse looked on, but still she said, not that bad, and then something.
[379:25.17]Let's talk to Transformer.
[379:30.81]Hello!
[379:31.11]What?
[379:31.27]What's going on?
[379:31.69]Why is this happening?
[379:32.41]This- I don't have my- There's no browser tab.
[379:34.33]It's taken off my computer.
[379:48.25]I don't have a browser open.
[379:49.41]Guys, there's nothing on here.
[379:50.45]What the fuck is going on?
[379:51.97]Okay, there we go.
[379:52.83]Alright, that was weird.
[379:54.11]The browser tab wasn't even open anymore.
[379:55.63]I closed it.
[379:56.37]He's right behind you.
[380:19.12]Alright, that's it, guys.
[380:19.92]I'll see you not tomorrow.
[380:21.48]I was going to say tomorrow.
[380:22.30]I really wanted to stream tomorrow, but I just can't.
[380:23.94]It's not going to work.
[380:25.42]There's no way.
[380:25.98]It's not going to work.
[380:28.56]Chunky stream on Saturday.
[380:29.70]Chunky stream on Sunday.
[380:36.15]You need the link to that vid?
[380:37.21]Absolutely.
[380:41.87]That was very, very, very good.
[380:44.63]Thank you to... That was...
[380:48.84]Cass Van?
[380:49.90]Cass Vandepul?
[380:52.22]Was the person who made that?
[380:55.71]It was great.
[380:58.33]I'll just watch the VOD tomorrow and pretend that you're here.
[381:01.75]That works too.
[381:04.47]I'll see you Saturday, guys.
[381:05.38]Same time.
[381:07.10]We actually may start a little early on Saturday.
[381:09.58]Not sure.
[381:10.46]To try to get some more time out of it.
[381:13.53]But good night.
[381:15.37]Take care.
[381:16.73]See you Saturday.
[381:17.99]Have a great start to your weekend.
[381:19.13]A great end to your week as well.
[381:23.04]See you later, guys.
[381:33.44]By the way, uh, we have zero drop frames in six and a half hours.
[381:37.53]If by Sunday, if by Sunday end of stream we still have zero drop frames, I'm gonna literally just start shooting, shouting out, like, like, shooting shit with my mouth about, like, who's gone, you know, what can I talk about.
[382:03.49]Hopefully.
[382:05.11]It works.
[382:09.34]You never heard the term shoot the shift?
[382:13.54]That means you like talking.
[382:20.47]And is Cox better than Comcast?
[382:22.53]No.
[382:23.85]They're both dog shits.
[382:37.29]ISP that is worth having in America.
[382:42.58]But this VPN, I think, really has completely solved the problem.
[382:50.56]We'll find out.
[382:52.46]We'll probably talk about this company on Sunday, if it's for real.
[382:58.48]See you guys on Saturday.
[382:59.22]Take care.
[383:13.89]you
[383:48.77]Thank you.
[384:28.15]I've been sitting here trying to find the perfect Sean Connery quote.
[384:33.35]I've been just sitting here trying to find one because the guy sounded like Sean Connery and there's really nothing even worth putting on the street.
[384:42.87]It's all like James Bond and he just goes, yes, yes.
[384:46.22]Shake it, that's good.
[384:48.26]Yeah, I'll cut out the red meat, sir.
[384:53.00]Too many dry martinis.
[384:55.86]Then I shall cut out the white bread, sir.
[384:58.14]That's it.
[384:58.38]That's like all of his lines.
[385:02.93]Alright, uh, bye.
