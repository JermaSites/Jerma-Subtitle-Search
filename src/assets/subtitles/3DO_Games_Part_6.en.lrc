[00:29.16]I kind of want to play the music that's playing right now.
[00:31.46]Instead of the intro.
[00:33.34]Hey, look, it fits.
[00:34.32]Ready?
[00:40.92]This fits the screen.
[00:54.85]Good to see you again.
[00:56.53]You fucking dorks.
[00:58.55]Dweebs.
[01:00.95]When are you going to play Marvel Rivals?
[01:09.66]I will never open that.
[01:11.64]Maybe I'll be like two days.
[01:13.60]On my own time.
[01:19.34]Is it actually out?
[01:20.76]Is the game out or no?
[01:26.42]Or is it one of those games that's going to be kind of in like an alpha?
[01:29.20]Or a beta?
[01:30.78]Or, you know, like a few months or a year?
[01:40.01]Northernlion's playing it right now.
[01:41.93]I'm done.
[01:42.37]I'm stopping.
[01:42.81]I'm done.
[01:43.43]Stream's over.
[01:46.90]Just go watch Northernlion instead.
[01:48.00]He's way better.
[01:49.48]This is like a way worse stream than he has right now.
[01:53.36]Don't you dare leave.
[01:54.38]Stay.
[02:01.72]We're taking attendance.
[02:02.54]Alright, today we're going to do the 3DO.
[02:08.85]And I've got some sad news.
[02:12.19]This is, uh... This is probably the last 3DO stream ever.
[02:18.65]Think about that.
[02:19.20]I've played this console probably 10 times, 11 times on stream maybe.
[02:25.48]We've gone through almost the whole catalog.
[02:29.62]This was in my closet for four years.
[02:34.06]And I said, oh, no, no, no, no.
[02:35.52]I'm not quite done with it yet.
[02:37.34]I know there's like another 20 or so games.
[02:40.22]I'm going to put that away for a little while.
[02:42.72]I don't know if this is putting it away for a little while.
[02:47.93]So that's interesting.
[02:51.49]I think this is the end of the 3DO streams.
[02:57.56]The person that just said, thank God, I want them actually timed out for 20 minutes.
[03:06.52]I want you to have to sit there in silence.
[03:14.23]Okay, before this burns in my monitor, I want to get it on here.
[03:18.95]The music is coming from, if you're new to the stream, hi.
[03:24.10]Uh, we're gonna go through a sampler of 3DO games like we did last time.
[03:28.38]And we're starting with a sampler!
[03:31.81]This is the Panasonic 3DO Sample CD.
[03:36.07]Uh, it doesn't have a volume.
[03:38.11]It's just Panasonic Sampler CD.
[03:41.83]What a good way to start!
[03:42.55]Here we go.
[03:48.05]Okay, so, uh, let's do the audio test.
[03:52.08]You know how we do, we have to do the audio test.
[03:56.51]and one two three one two three am I early or am I late it's perfect oh right off the bat that's awesome to hear okay so let's go this is a sampler we're gonna see what the 3dio has to offer again except this one's not in Japanese it seems to be in English I'm gonna go to real machine
[04:25.38]It's got goofy colors already.
[04:26.54]I love it.
[04:31.82]Where am I going to put my water?
[04:33.44]Alright, that didn't load.
[04:34.20]Try it again.
[04:37.14]What is the real machine?
[04:38.24]Alright, real machine doesn't work.
[04:46.19]We're going to go to Diversions.
[04:54.15]Ooh.
[04:59.56]These old consoles have such unbelievable soundtracks.
[05:04.56]Okay, so, uh... We're starting with Batman.
[05:08.67]There's no way I'm not going to press the Batman button.
[05:10.37]Let's see.
[05:10.59]Is this a Batman game?
[05:12.41]Or is this a... This presentation is used with permission from Warner... Warner Brothers.
[05:18.03]Okay.
[05:18.97]So we have permission.
[05:24.74]Is it just like a TV show?
[05:33.70]this is how I'll always remember you surrounded by winter forever young forever beautiful rest well my love the monster who took you from Dr. freeze learned that revenge is a dish best served cold
[05:53.85]In the midst of the hottest August on record, a rash of bizarre cold-related crimes have chilled Gotham to the bone.
[06:01.21]Once again, the target is a Goth Corp facility
[06:05.26]Is there enough of a proxy here where, like, this is allowed for me to stream on Twitch?
[06:09.81]Do you know what I mean?
[06:12.21]It's like I'm streaming Batman the Animated Series through a 3DO, through the 3DO sampler CD that has an episode on it.
[06:22.21]Is there enough of a proxy there?
[06:31.06]A heartfelt plea from the chairman of Goth Corp, the People Company.
[06:35.84]This is Summer Gleason for Gotham Insider.
[06:39.73]Hey, get out of here!
[06:42.01]Okay, this is a sampler.
[06:44.19]We just get to watch an episode of Batman the Animated Series.
[06:53.98]Taking up video games, are we, sir?
[06:57.89]That hurt my neck.
[06:58.61]Actually, oh.
[06:59.55]These are the stolen objects.
[07:03.03]They don't look like much alone, but in this configuration...
[07:13.98]Alright, Batman just did one of those mobile ad games.
[07:21.07]I was watching a streamer do this.
[07:22.35]I can't believe he fucked it up.
[07:24.01]Of course the tube goes where the tube goes, and of course the slot is where it opens.
[07:27.23]Okay, is this actually just an episode of Batman?
[07:48.88]It's just free TV.
[07:50.12]Alright, right now there's somebody in the chat room going, Hold on a second.
[08:01.33]He has the sampler CD of the 3DO of the Batman animated.
[08:04.43]That's an original.
[08:06.07]He doesn't even understand what he has.
[08:13.57]It is a master copy of the Mr. Freeze episode 202, Frozen Death.
[08:19.52]He has no idea what he has!
[08:42.37]Alright, I don't want to get arrested, okay?
[08:44.41]Wait, I just restarted it.
[08:49.92]Wait, is there like fast forward?
[08:51.28]I can't get out of here.
[08:59.35]I actually can't leave.
[09:01.63]I'm pressing every button.
[09:04.35]Oh, there we go.
[09:06.23]Watch Batman.
[09:07.21]Weekdays on the Fox Network.
[09:09.58]Based on the DC Comics characters.
[09:11.48]Batman.
[09:12.16]Created by... Alright, I don't want to get arrested.
[09:19.28]Wait, does that also mean that we're going to be able to watch the 1993 PGA Tour?
[09:27.07]There's also an episode of Two Stupid Dogs on here.
[09:32.65]I'm curious.
[09:33.27]Is that what this actually is?
[09:36.92]no this is a game wait use the d-pad up oh I didn't even get to read it that's one of these it's an FMV golf game these are the best god I hate golf
[10:08.59]I really do.
[10:09.29]I... I just... I hate it.
[10:11.61]I don't like anything about it.
[10:16.43]Okay, play around.
[10:18.01]Game setup.
[10:18.91]Let's just play around.
[10:23.14]One player.
[10:25.54]New player.
[10:26.46]Old player.
[10:29.40]You have to... Do you get a senior discount?
[10:32.80]I don't understand.
[10:34.10]Old... Let's do new player.
[10:38.70]Uh, let's go to, uh, Scottsdale.
[10:45.18]Okay, that's me.
[10:45.88]Uh, we're gonna do... What just happened?
[10:53.03]The game just crashed.
[10:54.29]Wait, was that all the time I had for the demo?
[10:56.73]Was just to look at the guy, set up a shot?
[10:58.77]Hold on, wait a minute.
[10:59.79]Go.
[11:00.87]New player, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[11:05.97]You actually just get to look at the guy, tee up the ball.
[11:09.73]I don't think the game, I don't think this lets you play it.
[11:11.34]I think you just, it's such a, what?
[11:13.92]No.
[11:15.30]One player.
[11:17.02]New player.
[11:17.56]Okay.
[11:22.84]Wasn't it like hit up and then down?
[11:24.36]I have driver selected.
[11:27.36]Oh, wait a minute.
[11:30.33]How am I doing that?
[11:43.08]He's holding that for a long time.
[11:44.50]Dude, that's the kind of shit.
[11:47.16]Okay.
[11:47.88]Alright.
[11:48.70]The demo's over, by the way.
[11:50.22]How many of you guys have ever been to a driving range?
[11:53.68]Just for fun?
[11:56.41]That's how most people hit at the driving range.
[11:59.59]The ball just slices as if you threw a wiffle ball into the field.
[12:04.39]I want to... No, I'm sorry.
[12:06.25]That one had a little bit of potential.
[12:08.21]Okay.
[12:09.57]A button to choose option to hit the T. B to start your swing.
[12:11.47]B again to set your power.
[12:12.38]B a third.
[12:12.82]Okay.
[12:13.98]It's B. It's B and then B and then B. How is that a round?
[12:19.84]Okay.
[12:27.48]Hurry up.
[12:29.44]How is it?
[12:38.01]Why am I not able to do anything?
[12:39.91]Okay.
[12:43.60]Well, we're done with that one.
[12:46.80]Uh, there's also road race.
[12:48.60]Let's do road race.
[12:51.68]Riveting gameplay.
[12:53.51]I mean, it probably was cool.
[12:59.01]Damn.
[13:04.40]Whoa.
[13:05.36]That was something.
[13:09.87]Alright, play, choose, let's choose track.
[13:12.11]Am I gonna get kicked out in 10 seconds?
[13:20.04]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, where are we?
[13:23.22]Was this a racing game?
[13:24.34]What is going on in these fucking pictures?
[13:32.23]What?
[13:39.00]Is this Claymation?
[13:40.58]Go to Surreal?
[13:43.42]Okay, did I pick it?
[13:44.30]I don't know how to pick it.
[13:46.16]I think I picked it.
[13:46.96]We're gonna do Surreal.
[13:47.82]We're gonna play.
[13:53.62]This is not... This is not your grandfather's racing game.
[13:56.90]That's probably how it was advertised.
[14:02.54]Oh my god.
[14:05.86]Uh... Okay.
[14:09.47]We all have the same car.
[14:18.08]I think that's, I think that's Elvis.
[14:22.20]Why is there no road?
[14:34.60]I think I'm winning.
[14:36.92]The road is not even loaded in.
[14:52.74]Alright.
[14:53.44]It's crazy to me that this is a game that would probably just get downvoted on Newgrounds right now.
[15:00.45]You know what I mean?
[15:01.13]Like... Or maybe not.
[15:05.11]This might be fucking huge.
[15:19.98]When does it end?
[15:22.45]Okay, there was no start, there was no finish.
[15:27.23]Alright, I'm going off-road.
[15:29.97]I can't.
[15:38.72]We've come so far.
[15:39.68]Do you understand how hard this probably was to make 30 years ago?
[15:44.56]Do you understand how difficult this was?
[15:47.10]This was probably...
[15:49.41]Okay, think of like when you make like Minecraft Redstone.
[15:53.25]Imagine making an entire video game out of Minecraft Redstone.
[15:57.26]That's what these people had to fucking do.
[15:58.72]This shit was impossibly difficult.
[16:02.12]It was impossible to do this.
[16:08.68]Some of these games required a blowtorch to operate.
[16:12.70]People had to solder wires to have the car be red.
[16:17.64]Oh.
[16:18.76]Okay, what about... Let me see the other one.
[16:24.01]Uh, we need to go... We need to see Cartoon.
[16:29.59]They had to use a blowtorch to make Elvis.
[16:42.95]Oh, this one's way worse.
[16:56.67]Now, I don't want to see any- I don't want to see anybody talking shit.
[16:59.63]Somebody had to solder wires to make this possible, okay?
[17:02.59]I don't want to hear anybody's shit talking this.
[17:15.70]It's a tree.
[17:16.54]Hold on.
[17:19.64]Can the bunnies do anything?
[17:27.06]I don't think this is a real game.
[17:30.28]This is not a real game.
[17:32.50]I don't think this is real, and I'll tell you why I don't think it's real.
[17:34.90]I think this was a Panasonic 3DO sampler to showcase what the 3DO was capable of doing.
[17:43.02]This is not a game that-this is not a sample of game.
[17:45.28]It's a sample of the technology that you can build a game on by soldering the wires.
[17:57.33]It's actually kind of grown on me how funny this is.
[18:40.11]Okay.
[18:44.52]Uh, we, I kind of feel like we need to see them all.
[18:50.36]There is a reality.
[18:51.42]We need to see reality.
[18:59.43]I wonder how this one, this one just a couple of trees maybe.
[19:29.72]I like the music a lot, though.
[19:31.22]That's the thing.
[19:32.26]I genuinely love this music.
[19:33.76]Alright, there's only one more, and it's space.
[19:57.47]Are they going to do alien sound effects or are they going to do whooshing sound effects?
[20:01.66]I'm guessing alien.
[20:02.70]Yeah, what's the thing that you wave your hands around and it goes... Theremin, yep.
[20:25.82]I just have hydraulics in the car and we're just bumping into this.
[20:34.77]Oh my goodness.
[21:03.06]Damn, these are good.
[21:03.70]Alright, that was cute.
[21:05.63]I liked that a lot.
[21:06.67]I was so... I loved it.
[21:08.77]Okay, what else is there?
[21:11.67]Uh... Color Echo.
[21:13.53]It's probably like a match 3 game.
[21:18.30]Use your imagination to bring a colorful new world to life.
[21:23.22]Sprinkle?
[21:23.86]Uh, no.
[21:28.10]Nope.
[21:28.89]Not doing that one.
[21:31.15]Nope.
[21:32.97]No, thank you.
[21:34.83]I can't look at that one.
[21:36.27]Let's do a shell game.
[21:42.37]Wait, what?
[21:44.53]Shell game.
[21:45.63]The shell game is taken from Shelley Duvall's It's a Bird Life.
[21:50.79]I'm usually pretty good.
[21:51.64]Okay.
[21:52.94]No, no, no.
[21:53.66]It wasn't ready.
[21:54.16]I think I know where it is.
[21:57.50]Okay, hold on.
[22:01.49]I didn't even get a chance to see where it was.
[22:02.91]Okay, watch.
[22:12.62]Got it.
[22:12.86]Okay, let's make this way harder.
[22:35.90]Uh, it's the right one.
[22:41.52]How are you ever supposed to do that?
[22:52.94]Well, this is just a one-third guess.
[22:54.70]Okay, cool.
[22:56.58]Got it.
[22:56.82]Okay, so what about if I do slow but hard?
[23:04.76]You know what I mean?
[23:06.04]Let's make this actually doable.
[23:24.18]It could be faster than that, though.
[23:25.54]I can make it faster than that.
[23:30.94]Oh, some of you just got baited.
[23:33.40]You took a chip out of the bag you're eating and you lost it.
[23:43.63]How long does this go on?
[23:44.71]Alright, let's make it a little bit faster.
[23:55.93]I already lost it because I'm not even looking anymore.
[24:05.96]sound is awful do a poll okay fine we'll do a poll for the next one not this one I want to see if you guys actually get it okay right can you do this one here we go ready
[24:39.40]It's too easy.
[24:40.07]It's too easy.
[24:48.61]What the hell are these birds?
[24:54.52]It was the right one.
[24:55.26]You were all going to get it anyways.
[24:56.36]Alright.
[24:58.08]How about two stupid dogs?
[25:02.43]It might just be an episode of a TV show, honestly.
[25:08.54]This segment of Two Stupid Dogs is for promotional purposes only.
[25:15.99]Oh, look, it's Otto.
[25:25.47]That's it.
[25:27.09]I can.
[25:29.85]You can?
[25:31.13]Oh, the horror!
[25:37.63]The MCA waiting room.
[25:39.05]Oh!
[26:08.30]Hanna-Barbera, yeah.
[26:11.82]Here's the thing though.
[26:12.62]1993.
[26:13.14]There was no such thing as a DVD.
[26:24.52]DVDs, guys?
[26:25.70]Are you kidding me?
[26:27.78]This seems like basic, easy technology right now, but the 3DO Panasonic?
[26:31.74]Wow.
[26:32.38]Saved the way.
[26:33.08]Big time.
[26:35.42]This being on this disk was... Whoa!
[26:39.67]You've got a video on there now?
[26:41.57]And you can put TV shows on discs?
[26:47.47]What was the first DVD I ever had?
[26:48.53]It was probably...
[26:51.39]Like mid to late 90s?
[26:52.56]Like 96?
[26:52.70]95?
[26:52.74]1992.
[26:52.76]I don't... That was VHS.
[26:55.34]I don't know if we were quite at DVD yet.
[26:57.54]I'm just going to shush.
[26:58.84]First DVD was released in 1996.
[27:01.04]Yeah, so in 1993, this was very, very interesting.
[27:04.04]This was actually kind of mind-blowing.
[27:06.58]This predates the DVD.
[27:28.54]Can you shut up?
[27:29.10]I'm watching this.
[27:36.14]This is technically not a DVD.
[27:37.56]Well, that's what I mean.
[27:38.91]Alright, that was pretty cool.
[27:41.19]What else is on this disk?
[27:52.03]Alright, screening.
[27:52.89]This is just going to be more videos.
[27:58.22]Why do they only put animations on it?
[27:59.82]No live action?
[28:01.06]There's live action on the 3DO.
[28:02.55]We've seen it a million times.
[28:03.49]The FMV stuff?
[28:06.57]Hey, you're about to eat your words.
[28:08.39]Because we're going to get a real live thing here now.
[28:16.29]Each of the video panels before you represents a genre of titles.
[28:20.79]It's like, there's the exit in case you think this sucks.
[28:23.33]First, you'll notice that you can move around freely by pressing the directional pad left and right and backward and forward.
[28:32.30]Let's look at the sports window.
[28:35.15]1993, guys.
[28:36.75]PS1 was, like, begging to have this kind of tech.
[28:40.60]Press the A button, and you'll get more information.
[28:43.56]Titles in that category will start rolling by.
[28:46.62]When you see one you'd like to know more about, press the A button.
[28:50.36]If you want to stop, you can either press the C button, or just back away from the screen.
[28:55.59]When you want to leave the screening, just press C again, or run towards the exit door located at the rear of the screening.
[29:02.51]yeah 1992. to see the entertainment titles alright entertainment titles we're going in 3D pinball battle chess cowboy casino we've seen that one we played it crash and burn draxen's revenge

[29:31.43]Oh, I don't have that one.
[29:32.07]Incredible Machine.
[29:35.01]Mega Race.
[29:36.77]We played that one.
[29:37.95]Road Rash.
[29:39.03]We looked at that one.
[29:40.89]Twisted.

[30:34.18]To leave, press C. It's a little bit lower pitched.
[30:39.38]That's very strange.
[30:40.36]Why did they... Okay.
[30:42.84]Ooh.
[30:43.14]No, we already did this one.
[30:43.96]Twisted, a game show.
[30:52.36]You've seen all the entertainment titles.
[30:55.16]Press B to start the list again.
[30:57.44]I think you have to pause.

[31:15.11]Don't do it, Jarvis!
[31:17.31]What the fuck?
[31:17.87]No, I don't want to see this!
[31:18.75]No, I don't want to go to school!
[31:20.49]That's actually kind of cool.
[31:35.45]A multimedia time machine.
[31:37.43]The Software Toolworks presents 20th Century Video Almanac.
[31:41.33]A look at the most important and intriguing events of this century with full motion video, photos.
[31:47.74]A multimedia time machine.
[31:49.36]Alright, don't press A. The Software Toolworks presents 20th Century Video Almanac.
[31:53.62]A look at the most important and... 20th Century Video... Ooh, what about this?
[32:00.06]Simulators.
[32:03.17]Cool.
[32:03.33]Cool.
[32:04.43]What?
[32:04.81]How come I don't have 3D adventures?
[32:15.00]This Hollywood-style interactive movie allows the player to control the action and the plot?
[32:21.12]Why don't I have this?
[32:25.04]Control the hero's physical appearance, size, and strength.
[32:28.06]What?
[32:28.50]Why do I not own this?
[32:37.37]Oh, this is going to be Batman again.
[32:40.87]Come on, that person that said it's only animation needs to... Come on, show us anything that's live action.
[33:09.70]What's this?
[33:10.92]Interactive movies.
[33:13.36]I think I've played most of these already.
[33:15.70]Jurassic Park interactive movie.
[33:18.76]Mad Dog McCree.
[33:20.20]Yep.
[33:21.70]Who shot Johnny Rock?
[33:23.26]Yep, we've played it.
[33:24.78]Star Trek The Next Generation.
[33:27.18]Don't have it.
[33:27.62]You've seen all the interactive movies.
[33:29.86]Press B.
[33:34.64]This is so cool, though.
[33:35.74]I love old stuff like this.
[33:38.58]What is this one?
[33:40.05]Oh, sports.
[33:40.79]Okay, well, we get it.
[33:42.83]This is really cute.
[33:43.59]I love it.
[33:44.05]Alright, well, that was that.
[33:46.49]That was a good warm-up.
[33:48.75]Uh, we're gonna need it because... Speaking of interactive movies.
[33:52.77]Speaking of interactive media.
[33:54.43]And being able to play and experience and be a part of your favorite movies.
[34:01.92]The next one we're gonna play is Demolition Man.
[34:07.85]based on the movie Demolition Man.
[34:11.25]I'm actually really excited about this.
[34:12.43]I've wanted to play this for a decade.
[34:14.75]And I get my chance to do it right now.
[34:16.17]So I'm very excited about it.
[34:20.05]Give me one sec while I take it out.
[34:31.98]Yeah, there were two versions of this game that were made.
[34:36.39]One was for the SNES and the Genesis, I believe.
[34:42.85]And the other one was made for the 3DO.
[34:46.75]Now, they are not the same game.
[34:50.07]They're completely different video games.
[34:54.24]Years ago, companies used to do this stuff where they would make different... It was like, oh, it's the same game.
[34:58.68]But no, it is not.
[34:59.90]It absolutely is not.
[35:03.59]Here we go.
[35:03.91]I'm excited.
[35:04.93]Demolition Man.
[35:05.57]Let's wrap in.
[35:14.49]Yeah, like Aladdin for SNES and Genesis.
[35:16.29]Exactly.
[35:18.39]This one is wildly different from the Super Nintendo version.
[35:24.33]It's an interactive movie.
[35:27.69]Here we go.
[35:40.56]A lot of Warner Brothers, they really kind of leaned into this, didn't they?
[35:45.86]Okay, Demolition Man.
[35:48.27]Starring Stallone and Snipes.
[35:49.99]I think I'm just going to press start.
[35:56.41]Already an explosion in the first 15 seconds.
[36:23.36]Los Angeles, 1996.
[36:25.64]Years before the PlayStation.
[36:32.22]Actually, PS1 was 1996 or 95? 97?
[36:45.88]Have you ever seen this movie?
[36:47.58]I have never seen this movie.
[36:49.21]I have no idea what happens in this movie.
[36:50.91]Not a clue.
[36:54.51]This is the kind of movie that was on HBO 2.
[36:57.97]Like, four times a week.
[37:07.18]There we go.
[37:24.79]Oh shit, we're going!
[37:29.07]How many bullets do I have?
[37:34.03]That's only coming out of my left ear, by the way.
[37:37.77]This is sick though.
[37:38.53]This is actually like video gameplay.
[37:43.35]Are there people I'm not supposed to be shooting?
[37:51.34]I think I had no clothes on.
[37:57.13]I didn't even know how to hold a gun.
[38:01.82]Who are all these people?
[38:10.06]And we get the title drop.
[38:14.00]Okay.
[38:25.31]Okay, another shooting segment.
[38:29.00]Yep, let's go.
[38:34.00]They throw grenades.
[38:34.70]Okay, they throw grenades.
[38:41.47]I'm out of bullets!
[38:44.31]Don't throw a grenade at this guy right in front of you!
[38:47.33]He just almost killed his own person!
[38:49.05]His own friend!
[38:52.97]Stop throwing grenades!
[39:09.98]I know it looks like the character is shit-faced right now because this is very difficult to control.
[39:20.20]Same guy.
[39:20.88]I cannot hit this guy.
[39:22.93]And he has a fucking hundred grenades.
[39:24.33]I have no more bullets.
[39:28.95]Okay.
[39:30.71]Now I understand how the game is played.
[39:31.89]Let's go.
[39:33.49]Do I have infinite lives?
[39:34.29]I hope so.
[39:45.87]Shit.
[39:46.73]Oh my god, it does so much damage.
[39:51.35]How would I not see that guy in front of me?
[39:55.41]He had to have been right in front of me, ducking.
[40:05.14]What are you... Did he come out of the same helicopter I came out of?
[40:09.14]I can't hit this guy.
[40:15.57]Oh my god, this guy's impossible to hit.
[40:28.19]Dude, I can see the orchestra!
[40:30.07]The orchestra that plays along!
[40:31.52]The conductor, like, whipping his hands around!
[40:34.46]And his hairpiece flying around!
[40:36.08]I'm dead.
[40:47.87]Okay.
[40:48.91]I'm not leaving this one.
[40:49.87]We're on this one for at least another half an hour to 45 minutes.
[40:56.12]Can't you just see the guy's toupee flying off while he rips his hands around?
[41:00.08]Alright, I'm gonna be quiet.
[41:14.55]I need to... I just saw the lower right.
[41:22.67]The lower right corner with his gun in the air.
[41:25.63]I think I'm out of lives.
[41:26.53]Oh, fuck.
[41:30.92]Oh, I'm so scared.
[41:33.78]Huh?
[41:35.58]I'm going to run out of... Yeah, I got to lock in.
[41:37.82]No more talking.
[41:38.50]I'm just going to play.
[41:49.90]Ah, I gotta, I, this is too, alright.
[42:45.07]what the fuck no what you can't be oh what the fuck dude how is it
[43:24.07]Okay, L is reload.
[43:25.83]Okay, I got it, got it, got it.
[43:27.57]We're good.
[44:00.83]Got it.
[44:01.99]Yes!
[44:02.47]Okay, what's next?
[44:08.10]You only have one magazine left?
[44:09.72]That's it?
[44:16.62]I love the nonchalant run in front of a green screen.
[44:22.03]Fuck.
[44:40.53]Danny Elfin?
[44:42.85]Is Beagle Juice gonna pop out from behind the thing and throw a grenade at me?
[44:53.96]I only got seven shots.
[44:58.38]How do you miss that guy that many times?
[45:00.38]I don't understand.
[45:09.54]How many times do I have to shoot this guy?
[45:10.90]Got it.
[45:31.45]You could have tried a little harder than that.
[45:32.99]This is just no effort at all.
[45:35.67]That was a joke take.
[45:46.81]Another one of these shit.
[45:48.44]I can't lose this.
[45:49.22]I'm trying to lock in so bad, even though I do.
[46:22.67]I'm actually locked in big time.
[47:09.46]Don't take any damage here early.
[47:17.49]I got the feel for it now.
[47:25.01]Always right when you shoot somebody, you gotta reload.
[47:33.61]Good.
[47:38.13]That is so loud.
[47:39.23]Alright, Stallone has no idea where he is.
[47:53.52]So even pointing down at the ground is fine for him because he has absolutely no idea where they're going to put him.
[47:59.54]All the direction they gave him was just point the gun around and look like you're aiming at stuff.
[48:04.93]You're under arrest.
[48:07.79]Oh, we found him.
[48:19.67]Where are the hostages?
[48:24.18]Is it cold in here?
[48:26.52]Or is it just me?
[48:34.48]I think this is from the movie, but we're getting the weird three... Oh, God.
[48:40.33]How do you fight?
[48:46.03]I don't know how to punch.
[48:51.47]Do not do the Mortal Kombat bullshit, please.
[49:02.48]I'm just gonna, okay, I'm gonna wait for him and I'm gonna off guard him.
[49:12.97]I'm not even on screen anymore.
[49:18.67]Oh, there I am.
[49:20.79]Alright, just get close enough so I can get him with the hitbox here.
[49:31.17]I think my leg is a little bit longer than his.
[49:35.06]I think.
[50:06.33]Oh, he jumped over it!
[50:11.71]I didn't know we could do that.
[50:25.64]Stop!
[50:34.72]Okay, I gotta lock in here again.
[50:48.33]Even if he jumps, do a punch.
[50:51.37]Why can I not follow up, but he can?
[50:52.69]I have no more lives.
[51:05.64]This is so dumb.
[51:06.74]Come on.
[51:12.98]Okay, there's a block, I guess.
[51:28.73]I'm going to lose again.
[51:29.55]He does way more damage than I do.
[51:34.71]How...
[51:45.72]Change the difficulty.
[51:50.84]That's not very nice to say to somebody that just lost.
[51:56.36]Now this diarrhea toilet bowl sounds.
[52:04.78]OK, we're going to make the game easy.
[52:05.78]I think it was loading.
[52:21.65]Alright, that's not bad.
[52:27.06]Hey, Fugue Skywalker.
[52:31.44]Alright, let's... Somebody said go to the options?
[52:33.00]I don't even... Is there even an options menu?
[52:37.22]I feel like we just went right into the game.
[52:49.14]Oh shit, sound effects?
[52:51.68]No, there is no options menu.
[52:56.63]It's resume, quit or turn the sound effects or music up.
[53:05.54]Alright, let me try this one more time.
[53:11.36]Press the D pad at the title screen.
[53:13.24]Wait, really?
[53:20.19]Oh, look at that.
[53:32.56]Mode?
[53:36.08]Access mode?
[53:39.51]Ah, okay.
[53:40.65]Send a maniac to catch a maniac.
[53:43.25]That's hard.
[53:45.21]Is it normal?
[53:45.87]You're doing a good deed.
[53:48.65]Easy.
[53:56.36]Whatever.
[53:56.72]Alright, we're on easy now.
[54:00.18]This should be much better.
[54:01.23]Let me make sure it actually went through.
[54:07.21]Yeah, we're on easy.
[54:07.81]Okay.
[54:19.69]Alright, yeah, I want it on easy.
[54:20.91]Go back.
[54:26.34]The controls are fine.
[54:28.60]I'm not having a problem with the controls.
[54:36.02]There we are.
[54:36.72]Okay.
[54:37.54]Wait, there's a password.
[54:38.56]Oh.
[54:41.92]What was the password to get back to where I just was?
[54:47.22]Hey, can somebody give me the password for Demolition Man for the 3DO for the level where you fight Mortal Kombat style?
[55:05.83]Does somebody actually have it?
[55:07.49]And do not give me the last ending cutscene or something.
[55:14.70]I guess I could just do this.
[55:22.72]Oh, there's an actual cheat code.
[55:26.73]Pause the game and press.
[55:32.77]Okay, level so you can get a level select.
[55:34.83]Okay, so that pause the game.
[55:36.59]Okay, let me get out of this.
[55:44.94]Okay, so we just start the game normally.
[55:55.01]And we pause the game.
[55:59.06]L, L, A, up, down, R, up.
[56:03.94]Ooh, okay.
[56:08.58]While the game is still paused, press and hold B to get the level select.
[56:13.88]Ah, level one, was that what that was?
[56:17.80]Yep, okay, cool.
[56:18.44]Alright, we're good.
[56:25.48]What just happened?
[56:26.90]Okay, hold on a second.
[56:36.93]Okay.
[56:41.53]Wait, why is it not working now?
[56:45.24]It's like resetting the game now.
[56:46.60]Pause.
[56:48.00]L, A, up, down.
[56:49.46]Wait, why is it doing that?
[56:53.56]Because A is to resume the game.
[56:55.10]What's going on here?
[56:56.02]How did I just do that?
[56:56.64]I was like, okay, pause.
[57:05.72]Why is it doing that?
[57:09.50]Maybe you can only do it once.
[57:17.83]That's very strange.
[57:18.59]Maybe I just have to hold B?
[57:23.29]Ah, okay.
[57:24.21]No, no, no.
[57:24.43]I don't want to go.
[57:24.91]I don't know where this is.
[57:26.77]Oh, shit.
[57:27.51]Okay.
[57:28.85]Level one.
[57:31.18]Options, password, level one, level two, level three.
[57:34.00]I believe it was level four.
[57:36.42]Which level was it?
[57:37.16]Five?
[57:37.54]I think... Okay, we're in the right spot.
[57:47.34]It's one...
[57:52.89]Level six.
[57:59.05]Let's go.
[57:59.33]Alright, let's go.
[58:01.01]Let's go.
[58:01.23]Let's go.
[58:01.50]Here we are.
[58:01.74]It's on easy now.
[58:12.00]Game is still hard.
[58:25.00]I want to do an uppercut.
[58:26.38]There we go.
[58:32.43]I love the just right hands in the face.
[58:47.33]Here we go.
[58:47.83]Combo.
[58:52.56]Is this health not going down?
[58:56.66]Am I going crazy?
[59:02.26]Both bruises on his face.
[59:05.50]Alright, here we go.
[59:12.11]That's it.
[59:12.41]That's it.
[59:12.93]What are you talking about?
[59:14.39]What?
[59:16.60]I kicked him three or four.
[59:17.94]Okay.
[59:43.44]This is going to drive me crazy.
[59:51.40]I can skip the level, who cares?
[59:53.27]I could just skip the level, it doesn't matter.
[60:05.21]This is so insanely hard to do.
[60:12.97]Sometimes you press the button and it doesn't work.
[60:15.07]And he does three times the damage that I do.
[60:17.71]And when he connects, he does like 30% of my health bar.
[60:22.68]You're losing to somebody with Beetlejuice pants on.
[60:24.68]What?
[60:34.80]Why am I doing that much damage?
[60:36.04]He takes up like 20% of my health.
[60:39.94]You complain when Elden Ring bosses do more damage than you.
[60:43.38]Oh yeah, a lot.
[60:48.12]You must be new here.
[60:49.28]I turned purple the last time I played Elden Ring.
[60:53.16]Oh my god.
[60:59.90]I can't do anything!
[61:07.78]I can't do anything.
[61:09.98]I'm gonna fucking freak out.
[61:22.75]He's gonna play like a coward.
[61:31.58]Why does that hurt me, but not him?
[61:35.46]Why?
[62:00.45]Wait what?
[62:00.89]I think I missed something important.
[62:15.90]Sergeant Spartan, you've been sentenced to 70 years sub-zero rehabilitation in the California cryo penitentiary for the involuntary manslaughter of 30 innocent civilians.
[62:27.00]You will be placed in cryostasis for the duration of your sentence, during which your behavior will be altered through synaptic suggestion.
[62:34.00]You'll be eligible for parole no earlier than the year 2014.
[62:37.00]What the hell is going on? By the way please uh do not come out of cryostasis and shoot at cardboard cutouts of all of the scientists.
[62:47.57]That'd be very much against our... What is going on?
[62:58.56]Why does everybody that gets frozen in time like that have to have a screaming face?
[63:02.34]I wouldn't want that.
[63:02.94]I would want to make sure my face was very normal looking.
[63:08.02]I don't care how bad it hurts.
[63:09.19]I'm keeping a very stone cold face.
[63:11.23]Because otherwise, every time they pull up your profile, it's going to be that...
[63:17.22]Like that screaming, like... I have a smirk.
[63:22.68]Be cool about it.
[63:23.52]How can a man be so blatantly sadistic?
[63:43.06]How was the fiendish Simon Felix apprehended back in the 20th?
[63:47.02]In the end, it took just one man.
[63:51.54]One cop.
[63:53.64]John Spartan.
[63:55.76]They called him the Demolition Man.
[63:58.16]Oh, they're getting cut out of the ice.
[64:12.51]The conditions of your parole are full reinstatement into the SAPD and immediate assignment to the apprehension of Simon Phoenix.
[64:18.92]Still Justice Jack.
[64:19.94]Or you can go back into cryostasis.
[64:23.02]Our computer has already examined every feasible scenario resulting from the appearance of Simon Phoenix.
[64:27.92]Phoenix is going for a gun, plain and simple.
[64:31.18]The only place a person can even view a gun in this city is at a museum.
[64:37.65]Welcome to the San Angeles Museum of History.
[64:40.65]Home, sweet home.
[64:43.29]Oh, how far in the future is this?
[64:45.47]Okay.
[64:45.73]I'm gonna have to shoot a bunch of people that are jumping behind the museum stuff.
[65:18.46]What was that?
[65:22.70]Was that like Robbie Rotten?
[65:26.14]This is like a children's television show.
[65:40.39]Only we can stop.
[65:42.37]I have 100 bullets.
[65:44.68]Alright, stop the grenade spam, please.
[65:47.70]Okay.
[65:48.76]Please get up.
[65:52.17]Very, very nice.
[65:52.95]Stand up.
[65:54.33]Okay.
[65:58.55]Mm-hmm.
[66:21.63]Wait, is he the car?
[66:23.31]Is he controlling the car?
[66:39.73]Excuse me, I'm shooting him in the head over and over again.
[66:57.19]It's all scripted.
[67:01.23]Wouldn't this be making noise?
[67:02.29]I don't understand what I'm supposed to do.
[67:04.05]I mean, I could just sit here and just get points forever.
[67:22.34]What do I do?
[67:32.95]pop left what am I supposed to shoot at it's so loud alright I'll turn it down of course I want to continue are you crazy oh I'm so scared
[67:58.02]I have to have seen the movie to know how this scene plays out.
[68:02.79]Something probably happens here where he shoots the rocket and a very specific thing happens where if you haven't seen the movie, you don't know what the sequence is.
[68:12.70]The plane falls down and lands on him or something, right?
[68:15.54]It has to be something like that.
[68:27.36]Okay, now it's the remote control car.
[68:35.79]Now it's behind the... behind this.
[68:41.43]How did I destroy this last time?
[68:43.03]I actually don't even know.
[68:53.92]Blow up the car.
[68:56.60]Okay, now it's... Okay, shoot this and it'll blow him up.
[69:02.76]Got it?
[69:02.98]Okay.
[69:05.56]That was way easier than I thought it was going to be.
[69:10.64]I want to watch the movie now.
[69:11.62]This movie sounds really great.
[69:18.45]Another shooting puzzle.
[69:24.38]Uh, painting.
[69:25.72]Cannon.
[69:28.54]What was that?
[69:29.92]Oh, okay, I can blow this up.
[69:41.13]He's dropping an icicle on him?
[69:51.81]What is he doing?
[69:55.84]What's the spike?
[69:56.94]I have no idea.
[70:03.26]I shot at it like three or four... Whatever.
[70:09.35]The Taco Bell part of the movie is worth it.
[70:11.31]I actually heard about that.
[70:13.53]That this movie was... I guess funded by Taco Bell?
[70:19.65]Also, we gotta pause this for a second because I want to talk about this too.
[70:22.11]I saw... Okay.
[70:23.93]You just jogged a memory.
[70:26.57]I got an ad on YouTube for an animated show.
[70:31.05]And this animated show was like, oh, it's some, I think it's like a kid's show.
[70:34.50]It's like, oh, this girl has like magical powers or something.
[70:38.62]And it's like a kid's show.
[70:40.54]And it was presented by Chick-fil-A.
[70:42.30]It's like Chick-fil-A presents, and apparently Chick-fil-A is an animation studio now or something.
[70:50.67]What's going on here?
[70:54.81]It's like, oh yeah, we're going to be making a bunch of series now.
[70:56.89]It's like, we have like... Restaurants are now making media?
[71:06.09]I thought I was dreaming.
[71:07.67]I was like, there's something going on here.
[71:08.95]Like, I need to like, drink a coffee.
[71:14.03]They're starting a... They're getting a streaming service.
[71:19.15]Why?
[71:23.60]Are we going to have... Oh yeah, Taco Bell, McDonald's.
[71:28.54]Is everybody going to have a streaming app with their own shows on it?
[71:31.07]It's going to be awful in the next 10 to 20 years.
[71:38.59]You're going to have 40 streaming apps
[71:43.00]and if a show like there could be an amazing show that's coming out like oh wow I heard this like this big actor and this big production team are doing this really new this cool show oh what what is it on oh okay yeah it's on it's it's on like the CVS app okay sure um CVS presents is it gonna get weird is it gonna get weird anyways let's go
[72:13.40]Sorry about your ears.
[72:14.10]Oh, what?
[72:19.32]Did I win?
[72:19.84]Why is this blowing up again?
[72:26.94]Oh, right.
[72:33.54]Okay.
[72:37.10]I know the order.
[72:37.80]I know the order.
[72:49.89]Is there a way to not take damage when he shoots at you from here?
[73:01.75]OK, we're good.
[73:07.31]Fast food companies are moving into slop based industries.
[73:14.13]Alright, so break the panel, shoot the icicle.
[73:22.56]And he moves.
[73:23.30]Where does he move to?
[73:24.96]Did it work?
[73:28.66]That's all I had to do.
[73:39.37]This does happen in the movie.
[73:50.15]Oh, not another one of these.
[73:56.06]I'm not losing this one.
[74:15.18]What the fuck?
[74:15.76]He does so much more damage!
[74:17.18]This is uneasy!
[74:49.33]This diminishing returns on damage, I think.
[75:01.29]He's healing.
[75:01.91]Yeah, it's unfair.
[75:04.03]It's like playing Starcraft or Warcraft against the opponent.
[75:08.47]They get resources 100% faster than you.
[75:26.36]Get him.
[75:26.74]I'm trying to at least have more health in him.
[75:28.04]Oh, he figured it out.
[75:29.72]He figured it out.
[75:34.38]Or did I just break his AI?
[75:36.25]Nope, I didn't.
[75:37.19]Okay, right in the stomach.
[75:41.45]This is gonna be close.
[75:42.36]This is so annoying.
[76:05.10]Guns.
[76:07.26]Fuck you.
[76:09.06]What the hell?
[76:26.05]I'm getting...
[76:39.35]Did I do it?
[76:39.73]I did it.
[77:07.45]This is like a really cool set, honestly.
[77:19.08]Let's go.
[77:20.05]Oh, I don't know.
[77:20.79]Look, I do know.
[77:21.53]Now turn that thing on.
[77:22.81]I hope you know what you're doing.
[77:25.47]Does this go through the whole movie?
[77:27.53]I'm to escort you to the cryo prison.
[77:30.34]Love, you do what you gotta do.
[77:31.36]I know what I gotta do.
[77:32.22]I gotta nail that maniac and put him on ice.
[77:33.92]That's where I'm gonna be.
[77:34.76]Enhance your calm, John Sparrow.
[77:36.04]Look, I've had it with enhancing my calm.
[77:39.46]Now you don't have to come with me.
[77:40.75]I can do this alone, OK?
[77:42.41]Even if Simon Phoenix was programmed to escape, extinguish life and steal contraband weapons, why are you proceeding into the depths of wasteland?
[77:48.75]The reason why your citywide manhunt didn't work was because Phoenix was in the one place that you can't monitor.
[77:53.89]I want to go down there.
[77:55.37]I want to find Phoenix.
[77:56.59]I'm going to put him in a hurt lock.
[77:59.91]Oh no, not more of this.
[78:12.26]underground base is that Sylvester stallone yes it is starring in the hit video game movie based on the video game based on the movie demolition man and the way that I said that is actually accurate
[78:40.84]Oh goodness, this is actually first person mode now.
[78:49.03]I have a radar OK.
[78:52.86]Write it.
[78:55.84]Have to eliminate everybody.
[79:12.15]Any of those people.
[79:14.73]Those are all actors.
[79:16.57]Don't worry everybody.
[79:17.31]This is an elaborate, expensive.
[79:21.85]LARPing RP session.
[79:40.21]Football pads.
[79:51.72]Where am I supposed to go by the way?
[79:53.26]Doesn't seem to have a goal on it.
[80:07.47]Somebody next to me.
[80:17.89]I see a cluster over here.
[80:33.46]Okay.
[80:34.40]Oh, it's on the marker.
[80:35.16]I see the marker.
[80:36.34]Go, go, go, go, go.
[80:44.61]There he is.
[80:44.91]There he is.
[80:45.19]There he is.
[80:45.43]There he is.
[80:45.69]There he is.
[80:53.71]What?
[81:06.41]What is going on?
[81:07.47]How do I kill him?
[81:49.52]uh so not entirely sure what happened here I don't know if he can take damage you're not supposed to kill him well what am I supposed to do just walk near him watch him from a distance
[82:19.41]It's an essential NPC.
[82:21.10]It can't...
[82:26.03]It can't register that he's supposed to die.
[82:28.55]I remember in GoldenEye... How many of you guys remember playing GoldenEye?
[82:31.83]The original for N64?
[82:34.20]And the main antagonist... You could just shoot him a hundred thousand times and he just wouldn't die.
[82:39.52]But if you had the Golden Gun... After beating the game... You could go back and shoot him in the back once and he would die and it would kind of ruin the rest of the whole game.
[82:47.80]It would just like... The mission wouldn't work, right?
[82:51.93]Because the Golden Gun killed anything in one hit.
[82:56.78]I remember that was such a weird... Because back then, stuff like that kind of didn't happen.
[83:01.22]Like NPC interactions and... Oh, you can interact with this NPC.
[83:05.08]You can kill that NPC.
[83:06.60]Stuff like that wasn't that... Cheat codes to be able to kill an essential NPC didn't really exist.
[83:13.75]So doing that, I remember being young and being like, oh my god.
[83:17.07]Look what I did.
[83:17.67]I broke the whole system.
[83:20.19]Look at what I did.
[83:22.25]I'm not supposed to be able to do that.
[83:23.87]Wow.
[83:24.63]Look at how... I'm a genius.
[83:28.71]I broke through the code!
[83:37.97]Half-Life did that?
[83:40.09]Half-Life was also PC.
[83:42.83]Which I didn't really... The only games I had on PC when I was that young was like Diablo.
[83:47.80]Alright, so what am I supposed to do here?
[83:51.68]Just... Do I have to kill everybody else?
[84:06.45]Is there an exit somewhere?
[84:09.21]I'm just going to sit.
[84:09.91]Oh my God.
[84:13.35]What if I just stay here?
[84:15.03]They'll all eventually come to me and I'll just kill everybody.
[84:20.46]Alright, there he is.
[84:21.16]Try to find an exit.
[84:35.22]That was the rope walk sound.
[84:39.27]There's only one person left.
[84:40.17]Yeah, there's only one enemy left besides him.
[84:42.59]Probably have to kill everybody.
[84:46.56]Maybe now people spawning.
[84:50.36]But I could just skip the level.
[84:52.52]That's in the toolkit.
[85:12.03]Yeah, there he is.
[85:12.49]I'm just going to run by him.
[85:22.20]There's a lot of people over here.
[85:23.81]Oh my God.
[85:29.03]Oh, he's right behind me.
[85:41.79]He's chasing after me.
[85:43.15]Do you need to follow him?
[85:52.96]Just follow him.
[85:53.68]Okay.
[86:04.79]This game is so cool.
[86:05.95]It is so cool.
[86:08.00]Like three different...
[86:10.14]I think at least three or four different video games in one game.
[86:21.67]Are you reloading the compass?
[86:23.67]I think I'm just putting it down.
[86:30.39]Beat it.
[86:48.39]By the way, the back of the box does show a driving level.
[86:51.83]So we're still here.
[86:52.79]I thought that was him.
[87:09.07]I do like the cowbell.
[87:14.03]Nice.
[87:33.01]I'm enjoying it I'm having fun still I wonder how much more there actually is in the game I mean here it is let's go blow this guy if the movie's an hour and a half
[87:47.77]What?
[87:50.61]This game can't be more than two hours.
[87:53.34]We're watching the movie play out in front of us.
[87:55.18]The movie's like an hour and 14 minutes.
[88:23.52]Oh, thank God.
[88:24.28]Plus one letter grade.
[88:27.02]If you gave this game a C, you're about to give it a B. This scene is great, by the way.
[88:43.62]Alright, if I get stuck, can you tell me how the scene ends so I can beat it?
[89:11.77]What is accelerate?
[89:23.49]Okay, it's hard.
[89:25.05]It really it's hard to see anything.
[89:38.77]205?
[89:39.17]Is that how close I am to the other car?
[89:54.91]There ain't much going on right now.
[90:15.30]What's the goal?
[90:18.38]Is there a goal?
[90:31.54]I think it's the bottom right.
[90:32.70]I think that's how close I am in mileage or something.
[90:56.24]I'm on the roof!
[90:57.82]I just realized I'm sitting on the roof!
[91:03.12]Am I supposed to jump to another car?
[91:04.74]Uh...
[91:30.40]Oh shit.
[91:31.70]Well, I guess... I think that was... I think I just have to drive for 252 seconds.
[91:58.46]Alright, everyone just relax.
[91:59.24]Let's chill for a little bit.
[92:03.55]We'll get up there.
[92:19.64]172 seconds, we're good.
[92:29.40]I'm not even sure what accelerate is.
[92:30.81]Faster!
[92:42.59]Faster!
[92:48.74]Alright, now that would be a great time to cut the camera to close up of his face.
[92:55.27]And it's like the leaf blower kind of blowing at somebody's mouth.
[92:59.29]His mouth is just open with the flapping going on.
[93:03.82]And this just tears streaming down his face.
[93:18.42]And he's got wicked red cheeks.
[93:20.93]A really windburnt face.
[93:28.17]I'm about to run out of gas.
[93:32.59]How am I... I'm running out of gas.
[93:35.72]I'm about to go to E. Is it a fuel canister?
[93:38.22]Wait.
[93:38.92]That was a fuel canister.
[93:43.40]I think there are fuel canisters on the ground.
[93:51.37]Oh no.
[93:59.60]I made it.
[94:01.52]Oh, does this happen in the movie?
[94:07.23]No way this happens in the movie.
[94:12.87]Hey hey easy easy.
[94:16.25]Drive back up.
[94:20.67]Are you kidding me?
[94:26.40]How does the scene end?
[94:27.18]How does the scene end?
[94:28.38]Do I have to jump to his car?
[94:50.05]What even happened back there?
[94:51.01]That was so weird.
[94:52.09]Oh, come on.
[95:05.06]This is the hardest shit ever.
[95:19.19]Okay, I got one more try.
[95:35.75]I have to do it before the fuel runs out of the car.
[96:08.33]I feel like he has 40% more reach than I do.
[96:24.38]Like, why is that not hurting him?
[96:25.62]Because he's blocking it.
[96:26.72]Got him.
[96:39.46]I think we're getting close to the end.
[96:43.31]80 more levels?
[96:43.99]Shit.
[97:06.69]Wait, there's 80 people to freeze?
[97:08.15]Or unfreeze?
[97:09.14]Oh my head.
[97:42.60]no I'm not doing one of these again I'm not gonna do one of these again okay here all the alright that was I got him I just holy I killed him
[98:13.65]I got all 80 criminals.
[98:31.09]I don't give up on these ones.
[98:32.41]I'm good at these ones.
[98:44.61]Yeah, I got 100% on the final bonus stage in point blank.
[98:50.61]That's insanely difficult to do.
[98:52.57]By the way, it was on stream.
[98:53.49]So how do they end this game, I wonder?
[99:13.18]It's great that there was one driving level as well.
[99:15.92]And it was the worst part of the whole game.
[99:18.46]Does it affect this grade level?
[99:23.45]No.
[99:57.85]Alright.
[99:59.75]You can spoil the movie for me if you want.
[100:02.47]We end up freezing him.
[100:05.81]That's how it ends and he's going to have a screaming I got frozen face.
[100:17.68]When the ice is going up his shins, he's going to freeze his upper body and face into the exact emotion he's going to have for at least 30 seconds before it goes over his head.
[100:31.69]He will lock in that emotion when it is at his shins.
[100:39.80]Is it cold in here, or is it just me?
[100:53.12]It's one of these.
[100:56.56]Come on, do it!
[100:57.48]Come on!
[100:58.80]The truck is driving by, come on!
[101:00.22]Yeah!
[101:02.78]Yay!
[101:10.45]Oh.
[101:10.73]Oh.
[102:01.76]He does so much more damage!
[102:40.27]Got it.
[102:40.51]Didn't even skip that one.
[102:49.47]Let's see how the movie ends.
[103:01.59]Here we go.
[103:05.73]Here it comes.
[103:12.44]See, look!
[103:22.13]He did it.
[103:22.71]He kept the emotion.
[103:23.71]This is a good movie.
[103:35.60]I feel like we kind of watched it in... weird... like 60 second TikTok ads.
[104:09.41]The movie Demolition Man, starring Sylvester Stallone, grossed over $200 million at the box office.
[104:17.75]With that voice.
[104:18.43]You know the one.
[104:21.85]Can't believe what happened in this scene.
[104:23.58]I can't do the voice.
[104:32.46]Good job.
[104:32.88]You saved the people.
[104:33.50]Phoenix is gone.
[104:38.58]That's all we get.
[104:40.68]Is it?
[104:44.92]Just one foot out the door with that line.
[104:58.68]I liked it.
[104:59.18]That was fun.
[105:01.46]I'm glad I got to experience it.
[105:05.83]Because I'll tell you something, stuff like this would happen where a game like this, you'd see ads for it.
[105:15.98]and it would come up with a console that you had.
[105:18.86]I had an SNES.
[105:20.76]And I remember being so confused when you would play the version that they're not really advertising.
[105:27.11]And I was just like, where's all the videos?
[105:29.81]Where's all the cutscenes?
[105:31.77]I saw the movie.
[105:32.61]I want to see the movie.
[105:33.53]And you just don't get to play that one.
[105:35.50]And when you're a kid, you just kind of think you're insane.
[105:38.00]Or you just think that you don't understand kind of what is on a commercial on the television versus what you get in your hands.
[105:50.40]I was like, oh, I guess this is what it is, even though I thought it was on TV.
[105:56.46]That was fun.
[105:56.84]I'm glad I played it.
[105:57.40]I'm glad I beat it with cheating.
[105:59.06]I'm going to go pee.
[106:04.86]We'll come back and we'll keep going.
[106:06.52]I've got four or five more to do.
[106:12.50]Demolition Man.
[106:13.36]I'll be right back.
[108:57.57]I'm back.
[109:02.93]Like, oh no.
[109:03.61]What's going on over there?
[109:07.20]Okay.
[109:08.30]The next one.
[109:08.92]We did just see a little advertisement for it.
[109:13.44]It's going to be Escape from Monster Manor.
[109:15.36]Seems like it could be fun.
[109:19.63]Give me one second to get it on.
[109:20.91]I think this is a first person shooter.
[109:35.48]At least that's what it looks like.
[109:41.44]I'm hoping for some goofy FMV intro.
[109:45.89]It's 3DO.
[109:46.29]You have to imagine it'll be there.
[109:54.23]And here we go.
[110:10.82]We'll do the audio test, obviously.
[110:12.42]You're going to play Plumbers Don't Wear Ties.
[110:21.98]Isn't that game banned?
[110:24.52]Actually, I can't even play it on stream.
[110:37.83]No?
[110:39.13]Ah, another visitor.
[110:41.77]Don't be afraid.
[110:44.17]Be terrified!
[110:46.05]Love it already.
[110:46.67]Foolish mortal, you are lost.
[110:50.91]Even now, evil's dark hand preaches for your soul.
[110:55.39]But since you are here, I, one who has lived through the ages, will kindly tell you a story.
[111:02.95]Listen carefully to my tale, for one day it may save your life.
[111:08.62]centuries ago in a distant land a mysterious cult forged a great disk of gold it sparkled with captured sunlight and protected its creators from all evil this talisman shielded generations of worshippers from even the darkest night's terror but this exile of evil did not last blind greed and petty jealousy led to the talisman being broken and divided among reckless factions
[111:35.22]By trying to secure the talisman's power for themselves, these fools reduced it to fragments of useless metal.
[111:43.02]Ghastly ghouls and black horror once again commanded the night.
[111:47.63]The forces of evil, unchecked by the talisman's brilliant light, threatened the world with endless gloom.
[111:55.39]Seeking to fight the tide of terror, the one who built this very house tried to capture again the glory of the talisman.
[112:03.37]Whoa, that actually scared me.
[112:13.75]We did a whole revolution around the house and he's still going.
[112:43.69]Damn.
[112:44.51]Okay.
[112:45.63]I got high hopes for this one.
[112:49.97]Music on.
[112:50.83]Sound on.
[112:52.63]Play for keeps.
[112:54.77]What does that mean?
[112:58.72]Play for keeps?
[113:01.22]I'm kind of afraid to touch that.
[113:10.82]Is it hardcore mode?
[113:11.72]Alright.
[113:11.94]Well, it's going to be regular.
[113:28.50]I do love the just standard just hand up.
[113:37.26]No glove, no like monster hand.
[113:39.22]It's just kind of a guy.
[113:51.07]Why am I here?
[113:51.67]Okay, wait.
[113:55.65]This is not going to be Slenderman, right?
[113:56.69]Am I going to get six keys and the Slenderman is going to jump out?
[113:59.85]Oh my fucking god!
[114:11.68]What is that?
[114:12.20]This ain't a scary house.
[114:19.96]Ah.
[114:22.68]This is not a scary house.
[114:27.18]That guy keeps following me around and he keeps being a weirdo.
[114:33.44]I don't think you can hit those ones.
[114:42.12]That was just a chill dude?
[114:43.32]How many keys do I have?
[114:45.93]Wait, we're gonna have to go into every room, right?
[114:49.13]Oh no, look out!
[114:50.41]The Grim Reaper!
[114:52.63]Be careful!
[114:54.39]Watch out for his two claymation animated frames!
[114:58.09]If you get too close he'll swing!
[115:00.12]Does he swing?
[115:00.62]Oof.
[115:13.65]The answer is no.
[115:16.87]I like it though.
[115:18.54]I like it.
[115:18.90]I'm having fun so far.
[115:22.93]What happens in front of the bullets?
[115:23.81]Uh-oh.
[115:27.17]Oh!
[115:31.57]Alright, actually don't mess around because I have no ammo.
[115:42.92]This game is unadulterated stank.
[115:47.81]That's a great way to describe anything.
[115:55.45]Oh, A for map.
[115:59.28]Oh, okay.
[116:00.16]So... Cool.
[116:14.49]I want to bait him out so I don't...
[116:22.01]Can you switch weapons?
[116:22.75]I don't think so, not yet at least.
[116:24.27]I... I need ammo.
[116:39.64]Oh, my hand's getting all bruised.
[116:50.70]Ammo?
[116:52.02]Get out of here.
[116:53.58]What the hell?
[116:54.30]Holy shit.
[117:00.56]That guy's uh... GEMS!
[117:10.95]There we go, finally.
[117:16.81]I wasted so much ammo in the beginning just firing at nothing.
[117:27.44]What's that in the distance?
[117:28.26]Alright, I think it's just a chair.
[117:33.52]Oh, the chair is alive.
[117:40.07]What?
[117:45.69]What's going on with this?
[117:59.20]I think they don't do anything.
[118:00.92]I think they're just there to make you.
[118:02.86]Yeah.
[118:05.45]It's just a ruse.
[118:06.67]It's just to scare you.
[118:08.19]It worked the first time.
[118:10.17]Nice try.
[118:24.42]I'm seeing this one through for a little while because I feel like it's got some potential.
[118:31.26]I can look at the map, I guess.
[118:45.01]Ah.
[118:48.91]Escape from Monster Manor!
[118:54.72]there are ghouls at every turn you will never get out you will never get away oh this is actually this got a little more weird
[119:26.42]Ooh, I think I need that.
[119:29.60]Yep.
[119:30.64]I think that's the item I needed.
[119:34.85]Found whatever it is.
[119:36.33]Alright, there's still a few places I haven't gone, so.
[119:44.13]Waste.
[119:49.76]Alright, where are we at?
[119:52.42]What just happened?
[120:00.39]There we go, okay.
[120:02.02]Alright, so I can go up and left or I can go... Let me check the rooms on the right.
[120:11.86]No, no, no, no, no.
[120:12.50]Wrong button.
[120:25.97]I need health and I need ammo.
[120:26.85]There we go.
[120:27.19]There's ammo.
[120:29.47]shit uh run locked what ah I need keys there we go oh this is just like the bottom
[121:19.65]Nice.
[121:21.53]This must have been a sacred gem hallway.
[121:28.96]Let's go.
[121:31.96]Fuck.
[121:49.55]I think that's everything.
[121:59.44]Damn, that was a hidden little hallway.
[122:10.28]Why was your instinct to shoot?
[122:11.42]I don't know.
[122:13.30]Every door I open is a monster behind it.
[122:16.57]I don't know.
[122:17.77]Could have been like a ghoul that it was attacking.
[122:20.19]I don't know.
[122:20.47]Alright, what if I go from here?
[122:29.08]Turn around.
[122:30.22]I think this is right.
[122:34.40]It is.
[122:34.74]And then bang a right and then bang a right.
[122:36.22]Okay.
[122:45.15]Okay.
[122:50.75]Whoa.
[122:51.19]Alright, that actually got me.
[122:53.77]Being prepared for a... What's that?
[123:00.26]Okay, that's the sound when you have full everything.
[123:11.25]Shit.
[123:16.55]Well, I got plenty of ammo and health over there.
[123:31.47]Alright.
[123:34.81]Where we at?
[123:38.24]Looks like up here to the left.
[123:49.00]Oh shit!
[123:51.49]That's a blue reaper.
[123:58.49]What is that?
[124:08.32]what do I go in this do I shoot this exit you survived the oh did I forget to tell you about that charming visitor who came before you poor fellow lost his head in an unfortunate accident we haven't yet gotten rid of him
[124:36.79]I'm going to save it.
[124:53.08]Full charge.
[124:55.08]Whoa.
[124:57.98]This is fucked up.
[125:06.66]What?
[125:06.80]What's going on?
[125:08.28]What's going on?
[125:08.68]Who is that?
[125:09.02]Is it me?
[125:17.09]What is that?
[125:17.43]What's going on?
[125:18.01]I actually get kind of scared out by this.
[125:19.73]What is that?
[125:20.03]None of these doors open.
[125:26.23]Don't do that.
[125:32.76]I think it is backed into a key.
[125:43.31]Oh shit.
[125:47.55]Anything else in here?
[125:55.13]Strip coins.
[126:06.96]I think they're just trying to scare me.
[126:12.94]Yeah.
[126:18.06]I hear chainsaws.
[126:19.02]I hear doors closing, doors opening.
[126:47.46]Alright, that person just fell off of a really high cliff.
[126:53.74]This is getting a little too scary.
[127:14.16]It's getting up there.
[127:20.75]What the fuck?
[127:21.41]This is so fucked up.
[127:25.21]You just know that when the developer made this, they wanted you to get in here and turn the corner and just be like, this is fucked up.
[127:33.62]Like, people are gonna see that and go, yeah, put like the painting right there and people are gonna be like, this is fucked up, dude.
[127:51.96]Ooh.
[127:52.76]You can tell that was like the intention.
[128:08.06]He screams.
[128:18.06]I thought I was the only person in here.
[128:21.05]Isn't that the whole point?
[128:23.49]You are alone in here.
[128:24.79]Will you ever find the secrets of the haunted manor?
[128:28.03]There's a hundred people screaming in here.
[128:30.35]Oh my god, speaking of a hundred people.
[128:45.72]That chair is where, yeah.
[128:47.78]A rocking chair like that in a single just room.
[128:50.28]You walk in there and you go, this is fucked up.
[128:58.56]That's definitely what the intention of the developer was.
[129:00.54]You get in there and you go, this, this is fucking, this is fucked up.
[129:13.35]I don't know how long this game is.
[129:21.68]I'm kind of invested somehow.
[129:31.10]Ooh, gems.
[129:39.42]Where have I not gone?
[129:42.87]All the way up?
[129:44.45]Did I miss a key somewhere?
[129:50.42]Oh, there we go.
[129:58.51]Pretty long judging by how little of the medallion you got in the first level.
[130:01.89]That's true.
[130:16.22]It was really not very much.
[130:17.56]I don't know how many Grim Reapers I can shoot.
[130:31.71]But I'm invested, I am.
[130:47.50]Ah, yes.
[130:48.90]This is way too developer island.
[130:54.34]There's too much stuff in here.
[131:07.03]Is it Chico just to watch the ending if you don't want to play the whole game?
[131:12.82]Yeah, we'll see if there's a boss.
[131:14.02]If there's a boss fight, I'm here for a little bit.
[131:16.92]Or we can just skip.
[131:19.90]This is fun, though.
[131:20.78]I like it.
[131:23.98]How'd you ever lose in this room?
[131:35.75]Ooh.
[131:36.99]Wait.
[131:38.33]This really is Developer Island.
[131:39.69]Holy shit.
[131:42.21]oh my god
[132:11.17]This shit's not worth much anymore.
[132:12.95]Yeah, okay, when you give me... a hundred gems in one room... in the first level... they really kind of... I mean, the gems don't really have a value anymore, do they?
[132:25.65]I'm not excited when I see a blue gem anymore.
[132:27.43]Alright, down here.
[132:40.08]Whoo!
[132:42.71]Where'd I go?
[132:44.73]Fucked up.
[133:36.87]Games like this that just play the same 30 second wacko music and spam sound effects make me sick.
[133:56.77]Yeah, this is Haunted House.
[133:58.73]When you go through the Haunted House for the first time, it's like, oh wow, that was crazy.
[134:01.57]The second time in the Haunted House, it's like, whoa, that was even crazier.
[134:04.90]Did you see what happened?
[134:06.06]I actually got to see more of it.
[134:08.08]And then when you go through maybe a third or fourth time, you actually know when everything happens.
[134:13.28]And you realize that it is just like a one and a half minute loop.
[134:18.12]And everyone just kind of resets and does it again.
[134:19.54]And you go, wait, wait, you mean they're not actually crazy murderers in here?
[134:23.86]Oh, they're just resetting.
[134:29.54]When the clown honks the horn, three times exactly, at me.
[134:33.41]He wasn't trying to kill me.
[134:36.83]Dude, you know what would be great?
[134:54.04]Procedurally generated haunted house.
[134:56.88]Yeah, go through again.
[134:59.24]Gonna be different this time.
[135:03.81]Yeah, the guy that was just in the clown costume?
[135:06.63]He threw on a gorilla suit and he's gonna chase you down the hallway.
[135:09.69]Try to predict that, motherfucker.
[135:31.75]You can tell when a game is bad when Jerma's jokes get worse.
[135:40.39]Why do you say this is bad?
[135:41.63]This is not bad.
[135:42.65]I actually really like this.
[135:45.56]It's because I'm invested in the game.
[135:48.32]I want to see more of it.
[135:49.16]I feel like I've gone everywhere.
[135:53.98]Wait, behind me.
[136:01.65]There's a two hour long stream of the dev going through the source code, by the way.
[136:05.01]Are you serious?
[136:07.99]That's pretty cool.
[136:10.31]That's actually really cool.
[136:13.58]And how it was made and everything.
[136:15.10]Wow, actually might check that out later.
[136:17.18]Because that's pretty cool.
[136:23.42]I'm just chilling.
[136:27.65]Where do I go from here?
[136:30.52]Definitely not this way.
[136:31.56]Looks like there's a door up here, but I can't see it.
[136:34.98]Where is it?
[136:43.95]You can watch it on your iPad naked.
[136:49.21]Why do I have to be naked? ...
[137:05.25]I don't like that.
[137:06.85]I don't want to do that.
[137:10.85]Watching anything naked is fucking weird, man.
[137:13.09]Like, I'm not watching anything naked.
[137:19.22]Watching a cooking video naked is weird.
[137:22.51]Watching anything naked is weird.
[137:29.41]What about playing Smite?
[137:31.37]Okay, is it weird that I think that playing a video game naked is not as weird as watching a movie or a video naked?
[137:36.66]I don't understand.
[137:39.00]Something about that is like, in one of them, I'm doing something.
[137:42.66]I'm like a caveman, right?
[137:44.54]You know, I'm like working.
[137:46.62]And the other one, you're just kind of laying down naked.
[137:48.30]It's weird.
[137:48.68]I feel very, you know, like connected to the Earth.
[138:03.17]I think watching a video naked versus playing a video game naked, one of those is weird.
[138:07.33]And it's not playing the game.
[138:12.71]What about reading a book naked?
[138:14.25]That's even weirder than watching a movie naked.
[138:18.93]That's 10 times weirder.
[138:23.16]I'd say that, no, no, no, no.
[138:24.36]Okay, if we're talking about the scale of what is weird, reading a book naked is S tier.
[138:32.00]watching a TV show naked is watching anything naked is all is like a playing video game is like b cooking food is like d that's not that weird but like exercising working out just in your I'm talking to your house
[138:56.43]Guys, one time I... Did I even talk about this yet?
[139:00.47]I went to... No, I had to have.
[139:02.06]Where Holly and I were making... Oh, we're going to make breakfast at nighttime.
[139:07.66]Breakfast at night.
[139:09.02]Whoa.
[139:10.60]It was cute and it was fun.
[139:12.16]But I was cooking the bacon and I didn't have any clothes on.
[139:16.78]And the oil from the bacon grease kept like popping up into my chest and stomach and stuff and burning me.
[139:22.60]And I just didn't care.
[139:23.32]I just didn't put a shirt on or anything.
[139:24.58]I just didn't care.
[139:30.13]And Holly even came over.
[139:31.00]She's like, will you put like a shirt on or something?
[139:33.04]And I'm like, no, I'm fine.
[139:33.96]I'm fine.
[139:34.28]I'm fine.
[139:35.62]Ow!
[139:36.24]And she's like, put a shirt on.
[139:37.46]I'm like, I'm fine.
[139:40.50]They actually was hurting me.
[139:44.10]I had to have told this before.
[139:47.59]I wasn't naked.
[139:50.63]That's not a good idea.
[139:51.57]You shouldn't do that.
[139:56.09]I've explored every single corner.
[139:57.71]Okay, not the top corner.
[140:05.91]You literally just said you had no clothes on.
[140:07.31]What is wrong with you?
[140:11.44]I don't wanna.
[140:20.64]Do I have enough health?
[140:31.19]Yeah, but reading a book naked is actually very weird.
[140:35.91]But wait a minute, hold on.
[140:37.44]Some people read a book in the bathtub.
[140:40.98]Like, oh, I'm going to have a spa day and I'm going to read a chapter of the novel I'm reading.
[140:44.72]Does that count?
[140:46.14]I don't think that does.
[140:46.84]Because me, you are enveloped by the water.
[140:53.82]That's not just sitting, lying on your bed naked with a book in your hand.
[140:57.66]No, that's, uh-uh.
[141:00.21]In the bathtub, you are enveloped by the water and you're enjoying your spa day.
[141:04.57]So that's not weird.
[141:10.30]What about on the toilet?
[141:11.46]Also not weird.
[141:22.55]He actually makes sense for once.
[141:25.53]No, you just, you just... I've been making sense the whole time.
[141:30.75]You just grew up enough to understand it.
[141:38.22]Need a key.
[141:49.66]You are just rage baiting so bad right now.
[142:00.04]Rage baiting.
[142:05.00]I want to see this map because it is going to be crazy looking.
[142:07.63]Okay.
[142:18.70]What's your sensitivity at?
[142:22.95]This really is kind of keyboard turning, isn't it?
[142:32.21]To the right, I guess.
[142:33.16]There's a couple doors.
[142:39.28]Wow, that's quite the room.
[143:08.30]And yes, it's okay for you to read the book version of the movie and it's fine.
[143:11.75]Like, if you read Jurassic Park, you're good.
[143:14.41]If you watch Jurassic Park naked, no.
[143:17.95]No, no.
[143:35.20]Wait, flip it around.
[143:36.90]I fucked up my own thing.
[143:39.00]If you read Jurassic Park... Did I get it right?
[143:40.96]If you read Jurassic Park naked, that's a no.
[143:43.64]If you watch Jurassic Park naked, that's also a no, but not as bad.
[143:46.52]There you go.
[143:48.58]That's still A tier.
[143:49.34]I fucked up the whole thing.
[143:52.42]Guys, there are people screaming in my ears.
[143:55.83]You can stay away from the screen and turn your volume down.
[143:58.41]I have to accept this.
[144:02.99]You could be making food and not even looking at the fucking screen.
[144:05.47]You could be in a different tab right now.
[144:07.21]I am in it and they're screaming in my ears.
[144:17.16]This one door I didn't go in.
[144:18.64]Okay.
[144:29.28]He also has a prototype development board.
[144:33.13]for the 3DO before they had final hardware to work on.
[144:35.99]You see what I'm talking about?
[144:36.89]That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[144:38.05]They had to use like soldering irons and shit to make video games.
[144:45.65]You should be happy.
[144:47.69]You should be so glad that there were 500 million IQ people that existed 40 years ago willing to use soldering irons and do this shit that was like impossible.
[145:04.69]Call of Duty doesn't exist unless House of the Haunted Manor isn't made first.
[145:09.15]Understand?
[145:20.38]Turn around.
[145:21.02]Left.
[145:22.02]Straight.
[145:28.32]What'd you say?
[145:31.20]What tier is Driving Naked?
[145:35.93]Um... The illegal one?
[145:38.77]Okay, then up here, and then this way... What if all the windows are tinted?
[145:59.51]No, that's... No, I'm sorry.
[146:00.57]That doesn't matter.
[146:07.49]Yeah, you're gonna have to get out of the car eventually.
[146:09.31]What are you, out of your mind?
[146:10.71]What are you talking about?
[146:11.54]That's okay, what if the windows are tinted?
[146:15.80]What are you, where are you going?
[146:17.46]Are you just driving around in a circle?
[146:19.78]To prove like a weird legal loophole point?
[146:22.71]I don't get it.
[146:23.11]Yeah, see?
[146:26.11]I can do it.
[146:27.45]I can't.
[146:29.21]What are you, fucking stupid?
[146:30.29]Uh-oh.
[146:40.87]What about if you do your taxes naked?
[146:42.55]Totally okay.
[146:45.55]That's totally okay.
[146:46.97]That's fine.
[146:52.77]Um, I have no ammo.
[146:55.21]Oh, I made it.
[147:02.72]Listening to an audiobook naked?
[147:04.20]Hmm, now that's interesting.
[147:14.55]now that's very interesting is listening to an audio book where does that fit between reading a book naked which is weird and watching TV naked which is also very weird but what's weirder I think that might be the most weird that's totally unacceptable I think
[147:40.14]Okay, if you're listening to it while you're in the... I don't know.
[147:43.80]I think it's unacceptable.
[147:47.85]What about soldering naked?
[147:51.85]That is a very high risk to your body.
[148:05.94]This scale is crazy.
[148:13.10]Uh oh.
[148:14.06]Oh shit.
[148:26.22]Why are you gatekeeping naked activities?
[148:31.47]What?
[148:32.81]This is a remix?
[148:47.80]I love this guy whoever this guy is whoever made this this is wonderful I'm so glad you made this whoa that was actually scary
[149:17.59]Hey, why can't I sleep naked?
[149:19.63]I didn't say you couldn't.
[149:21.18]I didn't say you could do any of that.
[149:22.38]I'm not barring you from doing any of these.
[149:23.84]I'm just calling you a fucking weirdo if you do.
[149:51.82]The music's getting faster.
[149:56.94]This guy streams naked sometimes, he can't talk shit.
[150:03.23]Whatever, I don't care what you do, alright?
[150:12.20]Whoa, cool.
[150:25.30]I think they're dancing!
[150:26.24]They are.
[150:28.09]I want to see them up close.
[150:30.49]That's why your facecam's been off this whole time?
[150:57.31]Now, here's the thing, shirtless is not naked.
[151:02.54]Partially nude.
[151:27.05]Alright, I think... I can't... I want to see more of this game, but does I want to play some other ones?
[151:42.12]I love this one.
[151:43.77]I'm so glad I own this forever.
[151:59.21]okay that was escape from um monster manor that was wonderful I loved it I'm glad we got to see the new house the new uh level now we are going to move on to space pirates

[153:00.78]By Electronic Arts.
[153:01.92]Interesting.
[153:03.60]Wow.
[153:04.16]Yeah.
[153:12.62]You also put the entire source code for the game up on GitHub.
[153:16.09]Wow, that's cool.
[153:18.53]I want to look into this later.
[153:19.79]I want to watch this later.
[153:21.71]To see just how.
[153:24.07]Because this looks crazy.
[153:29.50]Josh, definitely link that in chat because that's super cool.
[153:35.10]If you haven't already.
[153:38.37]Someone's receiving.
[153:40.13]This is Ursula Skye, commander of Thelonial Star One.
[153:43.82]We are under attack.
[153:44.84]Repeat, under attack.
[153:47.52]My ship has been overrun by the Black Brigade.
[153:50.46]Captain Talon is in control of the Star Splitter cannon.
[153:53.94]They're beaming colonists aboard.
[153:55.54]The Black Dragon is hostages until the cannon crystals are found.
[154:00.27]Situation bleak.
[154:02.25]Deflector shield destroyed.
[154:04.35]Can't hold out much longer.
[154:06.79]Please respond.
[154:08.49]Okay, I'm here.
[154:14.31]Football pads?
[154:19.45]The scourge of the galaxy.
[154:21.57]Captain Talon has invaded our fair homeland.
[154:24.31]Wait a minute.
[154:24.65]The evil machinery that works his sinister mind has concocted a diabolical plan to exterminate us all.
[154:34.02]Try another.
[154:34.72]It's the same actor.
[154:36.29]Welcome aboard the Black Dragon.
[154:43.04]That's a lot of fog.
[154:44.90]That's so much fog.
[154:46.02]I think that was not fake.
[154:47.96]I can.
[155:11.56]As it stands now, it looks as though this malevolent mystic and his armada of cutthroat pirates will succeed.
[155:18.88]His quest is my greatest creation.
[155:23.09]Not those guys.
[155:24.29]Talon needs now are the star crystals that will arm it.
[155:30.41]Well, these crystals have been lost for years on different worlds throughout the solar system.
[155:37.18]We must find them before Talon does.
[155:40.30]I don't want to see any of this.
[155:42.32]I don't want to see a single other thing.
[155:44.63]That was really loud in my head.
[156:06.65]Okay, cadet, ranger, okay, rookie or sure.
[156:15.17]Absolute would not do anything else but rookie.
[156:19.58]Okay, here we go.
[156:23.80]These pirates are armed to the teeth.
[156:26.00]This is a chance to improve your aim.
[156:29.36]I guess beyond the asteroid belt.
[156:32.10]Can you make it?
[156:37.24]What do I shoot at?
[156:39.36]Am I supposed to shoot the asteroids?
[156:42.18]No, not another one of these.
[156:45.90]Oh no, you missed that one.
[156:48.34]Oh well.
[156:49.70]You missed that one.
[156:51.08]Oh well.
[156:56.68]That's impossible.
[156:57.46]So I just fell.
[157:04.54]I'm dead.
[157:06.28]No, not yet.
[157:08.32]What are these coughing?
[157:23.11]I don't have any bullets!
[157:26.19]How do I get a charge?
[157:37.70]How do you charge the gun?
[157:39.70]Be careful, Ranger.
[157:41.44]Your energy level is getting critical.
[157:45.85]Oh, well.
[157:46.83]It's a Star Ranger.
[157:51.51]Don't quit on us now, Ranger.
[157:53.15]You can pick up where you left off.
[157:56.70]Okay.
[157:59.46]If you run out of charge, how do you get charge back?
[158:08.68]There was somebody right here.
[158:22.78]Yep, I saw you.
[158:26.80]Down the hall, yep.
[158:31.32]Alright, that was sick.
[158:40.36]Only one per... I don't even know if these are enemies.
[158:48.58]I... I don't have any... How do you charge the gun?
[158:52.71]I don't have any ammo.
[158:53.57]And I don't know how to charge the weapon.
[159:14.24]Click on charge?
[159:18.35]Ah, that actually might be what you do.
[159:19.65]I'm so confused.
[159:44.91]Come on.
[159:47.27]You're in danger, Star Ranger.
[159:49.38]Make every shot count.
[159:54.74]Okay, I gotta memorize.
[159:56.24]You have to memorize these games.
[160:05.00]No!
[160:05.80]No!
[160:07.58]Be careful, Ranger.
[160:09.33]Your energy level is getting critical.
[160:18.73]Whoa.
[160:19.73]Got him.
[160:22.01]Ugh.
[160:23.13]Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh.
[160:47.17]Is that a bad guy?
[160:49.29]Okay, they're just running into frame.
[160:58.36]Why did he die so much cooler than everybody else?
[161:03.96]What do I do?
[161:04.42]What do I do?
[161:04.94]What do I do?
[161:05.86]What do I do?
[161:09.77]What do I do?
[161:23.95]What are they connected to?
[161:24.95]Wait, what?
[161:28.01]Shoot the... Okay, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow.
[161:31.18]Got it.
[161:32.26]Now what?
[161:32.62]We're free!
[161:34.52]We're free!
[161:34.84]We're free!
[161:35.14]We're free!
[161:35.46]Commander Skye is on the brink!
[161:39.68]To the transport!
[161:49.29]Everything's happening so quickly!
[161:54.62]Stop!
[161:55.24]Get out of the way, please!
[161:59.80]Shoot when it's green.
[162:03.80]Did they all just go, Shoot when it's green!
[162:05.45]Shoot when it's green!
[162:13.43]I love when people use video game terms in the universe.
[162:20.90]That's always so fun.
[162:23.30]Like this planet, and there's these aliens, and these monsters, and there's this big conflict going on, and this thing's happening.
[162:28.56]Make sure you shoot when it's green, player.
[162:43.54]That one's tricky.
[162:51.88]why does that guy have to get killed every time this one's the immediate yep whoa come on there the energy level is getting critical that's total nonsense part of the wall
[163:17.24]Oh my god, he... He made a funny noise on stream that time.
[163:21.66]Is that it?
[163:22.42]Good.
[163:22.76]Wasn't that the... Uh oh.
[163:49.57]I love how it's a guy with a football helmet on, but somehow his voice is very different.
[163:58.53]He has a voice changer on somehow.
[164:12.46]Don't.
[164:12.98]I'm glad I missed.
[164:24.45]How did you even get over there, dude?
[164:25.97]How did you even get over there?
[164:27.03]That guy... What are you doing?
[164:30.43]How did he even go... Oh, God.
[164:43.50]He's doing so well, too.
[164:46.96]That's annoying.
[164:53.55]What is he saying?
[164:58.35]Get talent?
[165:05.68]Get talon?
[165:35.82]Why are you jumping into frame?
[165:43.69]What?
[165:45.35]You gotta be kidding me.
[165:46.49]That was actually ridiculous.
[165:48.61]He shot me underneath the guy's body.
[165:50.95]You gotta be kidding me.
[165:54.76]That was a perfect run too.
[166:06.63]What a fun job.
[166:10.33]How much fun would it be to be on set like this?
[166:14.17]What a delight, honestly.
[166:15.69]What an absolute delight.
[166:16.99]Get Talon!
[166:26.83]They don't.
[166:31.73]Uh huh.
[166:33.91]Uh huh.
[166:56.78]Uh-huh.
[167:02.17]Like I said, it probably smells really bad on this set.
[167:13.43]Baby?
[167:13.83]I don't know.
[167:16.23]It might smell like a bunch of fucking chemicals or something because of all the stuff that's here.
[167:19.77]Get Talon!
[167:24.66]Oh, like the random pieces of wood and plastic and set material?
[167:29.34]I don't know, probably.
[167:30.07]I almost shot him.
[167:34.31]Right here, right?
[167:43.47]To the right?
[167:48.69]Save Ursula!
[167:52.42]Good.
[167:53.52]Shoot when it's green!
[167:54.32]Oh!
[167:54.42]Did I do it?
[167:54.94]I did it.
[168:20.62]Come on, I had to shoot through.
[168:22.54]I love this guy too.
[168:24.74]Alright, right here.
[168:25.60]Coming.
[168:48.80]can be had alright but you'll need the robotic tracker but first you'll have to get beyond these these are the objectives oh one world holds a star splitter cannon the other three worlds hold the crystals that will arm it we know talents pirates hold the star splitter the crystals we're not sure remember this always there will be mutants tricksters ah but I'll help you through first I must tell you the arming sequence of the star splitter
[169:18.84]Okay.
[169:19.18]Blue, red, green.
[169:19.58]Got it.
[169:19.82]Blue, red, green.
[169:20.44]Okay.
[169:20.74]Where do you guys want to go?
[169:22.48]One, two, three, or four?
[169:24.06]Who do you want to see first?
[169:46.99]That doesn't matter.
[169:47.59]We're going somewhere.
[169:50.95]What?
[169:51.05]Everyone's saying three.
[170:11.51]This is weird.
[170:14.01]What is... Okay, that... I did not expect somebody right in the front.
[170:18.27]I love how this guy is more of a celebrity to us than an actual A-list celebrity.
[170:24.67]No, I...
[170:41.57]Give me my charge back.
[170:43.49]Okay, try it again.
[170:44.99]It's just filmed in the same location.
[171:09.45]oh my god it's too hard because he's but he don't know who's
[171:42.21]Too many of that.
[171:46.91]He's... He's still going.
[171:53.49]And he was not done.
[171:54.69]Oh, come on.
[171:56.15]I need both of this.
[172:13.96]Shit, I only have one shot left.
[172:17.44]Okay, here it comes.
[172:22.42]Ooh!
[172:45.01]Come on, dude.
[172:46.11]You gotta be kidding me, man.
[172:48.31]This one sucks.
[173:23.49]Don't do this shit again.
[173:24.51]That was close.
[173:29.79]What's going on?
[173:50.07]Why is this guy a cowboy?
[173:58.61]What?
[174:04.46]The disk may have skipped a few.
[174:07.94]The needle popped off the record player and landed somewhere else.
[174:11.64]That was very odd.
[174:21.16]star rangers I think that was a person that was I don't think I was supposed to shoot the person up there but how was I supposed to see that no I jumped your life support system
[175:03.35]Don't shoot top top left.
[175:10.69]That's actually insane how that happened.
[175:34.55]What?
[175:34.75]I don't even know what the lady was saying, but... What did I do wrong?
[175:40.57]No, did I have to do this all over again?
[175:45.20]Thank God.
[176:02.81]he laughs what happened here wait I shot it last time and it didn't do beware the grin reaper staff shoot him five times before he laughs
[176:27.18]It's not even on screen yet.
[176:28.17]It told me to shoot him five times.
[176:41.36]Or is it here?
[176:45.52]Or is it here?
[176:46.56]Or is it here?
[176:51.37]Star Ranger, I like your smile.
[176:56.07]If you fail, stay a while.
[177:01.20]Didn't I shoot him five times?
[177:06.08]Your life support system is running low.
[177:08.46]Be extra careful.
[177:11.90]Maybe exactly five times.
[177:14.06]Okay.
[177:15.04]I'll try that.
[177:18.38]One.
[177:18.74]Two.
[177:20.30]Three.
[177:20.46]Four.
[177:20.62]Five.
[177:20.84]Four.
[177:42.57]Star Ranger, I like your smile.
[177:45.62]That was six.
[177:46.36]Since you failed, stay a while.
[177:49.12]What do you mean?
[177:50.14]I didn't... Yeah, I fired the gun six times.
[177:54.30]I didn't hit him six times.
[177:56.08]Be careful, Ranger.
[178:00.73]Your energy... Behind dragon's teeth.
[178:09.18]Is the crystal you see?
[178:11.85]Or here?
[178:14.01]Or is it here?
[178:15.71]Or is it here?
[178:18.05]Or is it here?
[178:20.05]Is it here?
[178:22.51]Did I get him?
[178:27.67]You must be out of your skull hunting talent.
[178:31.11]Try your hand at one of these.
[178:36.10]damn that was cool what is this supposed to be this is not I'm not afraid of any of this
[179:03.71]I think I did it.
[179:04.21]Okay, we got the red crystal.
[179:06.95]I'm gonna say one.
[179:22.35]Oh, someone's going down that hill.
[179:24.11]Someone's going down that hill and it's gonna be an epic fall.
[179:33.54]Ah, I had to reload.
[179:34.46]Shit.
[179:45.44]Continue?
[179:46.28]Whatever.
[179:48.92]Continue.
[179:50.96]Oh no, the game's fucked up.
[179:52.33]Wait.
[179:52.53]What if I quit?
[179:57.95]What?
[180:04.12]Uh-oh.
[180:05.46]Oh, no.
[180:06.86]No!
[180:07.10]I actually can't even change anything.
[180:15.26]Maybe I should reset.
[180:20.27]Do you think it'll save it?
[180:32.97]I'm going to try to reset the game and see if it keeps the progress.
[180:36.15]We're just getting started.
[180:51.13]Now that you've bricked your Space Pirates save, can you please play Dr. Hauser?
[180:56.97]Generally great game.
[180:58.09]Makes the 3DL look good.
[181:03.67]Let's just hope first of all, that this is fine.
[181:12.46]It's a guarantee that it didn't save.
[181:14.34]Well, we don't know that video was way before its time.
[181:30.53]Hmm.
[181:35.39]Come on.
[181:37.29]I see it continue.
[181:38.31]Oh no, it's messed up.
[181:48.64]No.
[181:52.32]Oh no, what happened?
[181:55.12]It messed up.
[181:57.65]Shit.
[181:59.75]Oh man.
[182:00.41]Is there any cheat codes?
[182:07.53]This got corrupted.
[182:10.39]Let's see, are there cheat codes?
[182:14.23]There might be.
[182:15.69]Like a level select.
[182:24.25]Shit, I want to see what happens when you put the three crystals in.
[182:26.27]Hey, this happens when you use hardware, original hardware.
[182:39.91]Not again.
[182:40.29]We can't do this again.
[182:41.15]Viewers are dropping because you're not playing Dr. Hauser.
[182:45.00]I got viewers.
[182:46.76]There's at least five of you here.
[182:51.90]Oh, well.
[182:53.18]That was... That was pretty great, though.
[182:56.88]Do I want to do that all over again?
[182:58.04]But what if it bricks in the same place?
[182:59.56]That's what I'm scared about because the disk might be messed up.
[183:02.82]I'm afraid that we'll get to the same spot and it'll do the same thing.
[183:05.84]Shit.
[183:07.92]It's alright.
[183:09.73]We got a lot of laughs out of it.
[183:10.95]It was very fun.
[183:16.89]Alright, now... I think I want to do... This game's called Blade Force.
[183:29.34]Let's try Blade Force.
[183:30.48]This one looked very interesting.
[183:32.58]They're bangers today.
[183:34.04]These ones are great.
[183:34.72]I'm glad I kept these to the last one.
[183:49.64]I'm so happy it was the same actor too.
[183:58.83]Sorry, space pirates.
[184:01.29]You got screwed up.
[184:15.35]What did all these games cost you?
[184:17.83]They range, but not as much as you might think.
[184:25.09]I've kind of collected these over the last six or seven years.
[184:28.57]Anytime I see like, oh, 3DO games, I always kind of like peruse it.
[184:33.77]The average on a game like this is probably between like 15, like 10 and 15, like 30.
[184:42.40]Average probably around like 20, 30 bucks, 40 bucks.
[184:45.48]Not as crazy as you might think it is.
[184:47.12]It's so old.
[184:47.86]Chaos, mayhem, and destruction rule.
[184:51.18]And the police are at the scene.
[184:52.72]A city taken over by crime lords like Terrence Pitt.
[184:58.48]With his trigger-happy thug, he rules the criminal underworld with an iron fist.
[185:04.62]Steel Medusa Sisters, the product of a biometallurgical experiment, gone bad.
[185:13.58]Okay.
[185:13.97]Interested.
[185:15.23]Okay.
[185:33.74]Reverend Biatch.
[185:35.68]She may be blind, but this spiritual televangelist uses doomsday hysteria to steal your money.
[185:45.11]Ugly Two-Head.
[185:46.77]This fellow surgeon deals in defective cloned body parts.
[185:53.21]Horace Shearer.
[185:54.75]This easy lawyer only represents criminals.
[186:00.77]They must be stopped.
[186:05.08]All these games were just bleeding.
[186:07.14]Oh my god.
[186:08.14]That guy looked like the weird bowtie old person image that I took like seven years ago.
[186:11.92]I want to see that guy again.
[186:36.90]I don't think that's keeping you in the air.
[186:39.44]You are sinking like a rock if that's how fast the blades are going.
[186:48.32]OK, select interface.
[186:55.56]Radar.
[186:56.09]Oh OK.
[187:00.85]I think I'm a. I think I'm a top in top left top right kind of guy.
[187:11.12]Right in the middle is good.
[187:11.80]Alright, let's go.
[187:16.63]Uh, we don't, doesn't matter.
[187:17.77]Holy shit, that's, that is, that is the face.
[187:24.48]Doctor Freeman.
[187:33.68]Dr. Grubert has set up a training mission for you to practice on.
[187:37.20]This should help you gain the needed clues to where the underground has placed your resources.
[187:40.95]Okay.
[187:45.73]Mapping system.
[187:46.33]Mission objective.
[187:48.09]Regular mission.
[187:48.65]Starting position.
[187:49.71]Skip mission.
[187:54.91]There are many resources, but these are needed to beat your enemies.
[187:58.00]Good luck.
[187:59.60]Do I have to destroy all these?
[188:02.00]Power plant.
[188:05.51]Yeah, just destroy stuff.
[188:13.68]That's me.
[188:15.96]Oh boy, this is throw up controls.
[188:17.46]I can't.
[188:26.86]Okay.
[188:29.80]What?
[188:30.68]Pick up for stronger pulse gun.
[188:33.97]Ooh.
[188:36.78]Pick up for stronger weapon.
[188:45.26]Cool.
[188:50.85]Is it like a backdash?
[188:56.73]Ow.
[189:02.25]Alright, I think I get it.
[189:15.16]That's triple shot.
[189:25.05]Alright, I think I get it.
[189:26.11]Okay, he wants me to go this way.
[189:36.39]Which part of this is the blade force?
[189:38.57]I'm the blade force.
[189:42.49]It's one guy.
[189:43.15]It's me.
[190:09.58]Actually, kind of not that bad.
[190:20.11]The propeller is the blade.
[190:21.39]Yeah, blade force.
[190:23.87]Blade force is very, it's a very literal meaning.
[190:27.37]Means I have a helicopter coming out of my head.
[190:29.19]That's it.
[190:35.84]Where does this want me to go?
[190:36.84]I'm very confused.
[190:53.79]You're stuck in the idiot trap, honestly.
[190:56.23]OK.
[191:22.63]Alright, so I think I know.
[191:23.63]I think I get it.
[191:25.75]How do I tell the doctor to let me off the training ground?
[191:35.48]Those are bombs.
[191:39.50]What happens if I lose altitude?
[191:50.63]I don't know.
[191:50.91]Yeah, where does it want me to actually go?
[191:52.21]I don't even know where it wants me to be.
[191:56.09]He was like, get out of the training ground so I can make sure you know what you're doing.
[192:00.27]All of my absolutely terrible directions.
[192:05.74]The ones on the floor tell you to go this way.
[192:07.48]The ones in the air tell you to go that way.
[192:09.26]Who cares?
[192:10.04]This fuel.
[192:14.26]Alright, I think I'm just going to leave.
[192:20.25]Health pick me up.
[192:21.53]Flight fuel pick me up.
[192:23.73]Jet fuel pick me up, OK.
[192:24.93]Alright, I'm good.
[192:40.86]I'm good.
[192:41.24]Get me out of here.
[192:49.60]I understand.
[192:50.22]I get it.
[192:50.56]I get it.
[192:50.84]I get it.
[192:51.82]I understand.
[192:52.24]Let me play.
[193:02.91]Oh, that's a cheap joke prank arrow.
[193:22.60]What am I supposed to do?
[193:26.22]I don't know.
[193:28.75]Blow it up?
[193:36.67]Shoot the triangle?
[193:53.28]Oh, that's a key.
[193:57.05]What is that?
[194:07.73]What's happening?
[194:08.98]Oh, it opened the door.
[194:36.11]I'm gonna play a different one.
[194:44.40]It's not that I don't like this one.
[194:46.12]It's just this one's a little too confusing.
[194:47.74]We're gonna play Space Hulk.
[194:50.36]This is a 40k game.
[194:59.69]Vengeance of the Blood Angels.
[195:18.20]Can we get an Arshweet, please?
[195:19.58]Yeah.
[195:24.84]Arshweet.
[195:29.70]I expect 10,000 subs right now for that.
[195:33.17]Like, give me a break.
[195:34.85]You see how much effort that took me to do?
[195:37.09]See how hard that, how much effort I gave you there?
[195:50.97]That was a lot of time for me to do that.
[195:54.47]Ooh, this looks cool.
[196:05.74]Can you be quiet?
[196:06.34]I'm playing PoE 2.
[196:07.02]That's right.
[196:08.08]PoE 2 is out.
[196:08.82]I know Ster said he was going to play it.
[196:11.14]He was very excited about it.
[196:17.50]PoE 2 for Ster is like them announcing a Gremlins 3 movie that's coming out.
[196:22.73]And it's going to be all practical effects and the same director.
[196:27.99]What?
[196:35.73]Ah, what door do I want to go in?
[196:37.35]I'm already excited, okay.
[196:38.91]Left door or right door?
[196:45.27]Left door?
[197:04.87]Space Hulk Originals, classic missions.
[197:07.59]Let's go to famous missions.
[197:12.33]Malak.
[197:14.32]Unholy Amalgam.
[197:17.00]Plunder and Purge.
[197:24.49]Clear this room?
[197:45.63]Oh shit.
[197:47.61]Oh sweet.
[197:49.31]Oh my god!
[197:51.71]This is kind of scary.
[197:52.79]Did I just do it?
[198:25.99]Wait.
[198:29.05]How did I lose?
[198:29.96]It's a strategy game?
[198:35.44]Oh, do I have to place units?
[198:40.93]Oh, I think I have to place units.
[199:02.46]Keep everybody alive?
[199:03.41]I don't see anybody.
[199:10.13]Hundreds of them?
[199:12.97]Wait.
[199:17.12]That was two?
[199:24.22]Oh my god.
[199:29.55]My chainsawing?
[199:41.09]I'm okay.
[199:41.61]I have two more people.
[199:47.33]There are hundreds of them!
[199:48.41]There are so many down this hallway!
[199:58.80]It's like Left 4 Dead.
[199:59.70]Before Left 4 Dead.
[200:00.82]Oh god.
[200:11.41]Am I gonna run out of ammo?
[200:13.27]That's a lot of blood.
[200:19.41]He's dead.
[200:20.69]No he's not.
[200:21.49]I'm good.
[200:49.42]It's okay.
[200:49.70]It's okay.
[200:49.96]We got two more.
[200:50.46]We got two more people.
[200:54.96]Am I supposed to go somewhere?
[200:57.42]How do you have no ammo already?
[200:58.62]I thought this was a console for kids.
[201:10.37]No, the 3DO was a mature audience.
[201:19.62]You gotta claim the room.
[201:21.00]I think I played a hard level.
[201:32.23]The 3DO was stupid expensive versus other consoles during the era.
[201:37.48]How much was it in regards to inflation and stuff?
[201:42.56]Like what would it cost now?
[201:51.58]Brothers, I bring grave news.
[201:54.45]A gargantuan
[201:56.03]I think it was $700 in 1993.
[201:56.69]Wow.
[201:56.83]Oh my God.
[201:57.15]Like 1500 bucks?
[201:57.57]Holy shit.
[201:57.83]It's like a car.
[202:22.14]That's why it failed.
[202:22.98]The PS1 was $300.
[202:23.40]The 3DO sucks.
[202:38.70]3DO was way before its time.
[202:40.06]Did you understand?
[202:42.14]Nobody was doing- Nobody could do this shit.
[202:44.70]1992?
[202:45.17]Full motion video.
[202:48.35]Rendered.
[202:48.93]Fully rendered scenes.
[202:51.27]Cutscenes.
[202:51.95]Storage on a disk.
[202:53.85]Ain't nobody would do that.
[202:55.61]Ain't nobody would- What did I just even say?
[202:58.86]Ain't nobody was doing that, is what I'm saying.
[203:00.80]Nobody was doing that.
[203:02.66]It had to be wicked expensive.
[203:03.68]It had to be super- I mean, it took so much to do all this.
[203:12.93]Yeah, PS1 came out seven and a half years later.
[203:20.10]PS1 came out in 1996, 1997.
[203:21.48]They were doing this four years, five years before the PS1.
[203:29.93]What was going on?
[203:33.63]Show these people Dr. Hauser.
[203:35.03]Prove them wrong.
[203:36.95]You just want another 3DO stream.
[203:43.78]Wait, you're actually selecting them.
[203:45.20]Hold on.
[203:45.64]Can I make them move?
[203:47.84]Oh, they're all behind me.
[203:58.40]Alright, we're good.
[204:04.24]Is he already dead?
[204:05.14]No.
[204:05.30]Alright, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[204:07.44]We're all in a line.
[204:08.44]This is a very bad idea.
[204:16.21]Alright, at least the guy next in line has ammo.
[204:25.17]Will you ever do a GameCube stream?
[204:26.53]I kind of already did.
[204:29.52]I had an original Wii.
[204:32.76]And we played a lot of GameCube stuff years ago.
[204:38.80]I did PS1, PS2.
[204:41.62]GameCube, Dreamcast, 3DO.
[204:46.40]What other old consoles did I do?
[204:49.12]I've never done N64.
[204:49.98]N64 was... Because to do original hardware with N64, it is unbelievably expensive, I think, because the cartridges.
[205:07.86]But, I mean, obviously, there's tons of ways to do N64 now with, like, the Switch has all that stuff.
[205:16.12]Virtual console was so great.
[205:19.96]PS5 Pro.
[205:22.42]That's too old.
[205:24.56]Alright, this one's really cool, but I think my brain is too small right now, so I'm going to do the last one.
[205:29.10]Yes, that's right.
[205:29.63]There's only one more.
[205:34.69]Final game is Dungeons & Dragons Slayer.
[205:45.21]There's also a lot of stuff that came out for the 3DO that came up for other things.
[205:50.60]Because at the time, Windows and DOS, they were capable of putting on the same type of show that 3DO did.
[206:00.18]So the 3DO was in a category of, oh, wait, it's an on MS-DOS as well.
[206:06.29]What I tried to get is a lot of the stuff that was not on anything else but the 3DO.
[206:21.19]PO'd was on the 3DO.
[206:22.24]We played it a few years ago.
[206:29.82]Ow.
[206:30.80]Back in 2019 or whatever it was.
[206:44.03]I've had, uh... I've wanted to go back and do stuff like the Philips CDI.
[206:49.73]The problem...
[207:05.78]This one had all the FMV stuff, it had all the goofy, weird games.
[207:14.08]And I'm glad I have it.
[207:24.52]What's up with Dr. Hauser?
[207:26.57]I have no idea what that is.
[207:31.36]I'm not saying like dog balls or something, right?
[207:34.34]That's a game like dog balls or something, right?
[207:39.81]That person just making up a name or is that real?
[207:43.03]Dungeons & Dragons Slayer.
[208:04.97]There's actually quite a few CDI games.
[208:09.62]It might be fun to do.
[208:10.66]I love old stuff like this.
[208:17.84]Even for Windows, too.
[208:18.64]I used to do MS-DOS nights where we would just find a bunch of crazy stuff on DOS or Windows 3.2.
[208:22.48]The only problem with trying to do some of those old Windows games, I've done them, but a lot of times you have to do a virtual machine.
[208:33.74]And it is such a pain in the ass sometimes, but I remember putting together a virtual machine for Windows 95 and running stuff through it.
[208:44.75]I recorded videos that way.
[208:45.89]That's how I made some of the videos on the old PC games.
[208:52.57]Okay, this is Slayer.
[208:55.34]Choose character.
[208:56.24]Create character.
[208:58.02]Oh, never mind.
[209:01.34]How many points do I get?
[209:02.06]I feel like this is telling me I can't do that.
[209:15.12]Alright, dwarf, gnome.
[209:16.68]I'm going to have to be gnome, right?
[209:18.14]There's no other option.
[209:20.68]Alignment, chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil.
[209:25.46]Where's disciplined emotional, right?
[209:34.79]No, I'm not going to pick the 98.8% every single person that ever plays a video game choice, which is this.
[209:53.82]Uh, I'm going to be lawful good.
[209:58.18]Ranger... I can't be a gnome?
[210:00.42]No gnome paladins?
[210:01.57]No gnome mages?
[210:03.59]They fixed that in... They fixed that in fucking TBC, dude.
[210:06.51]What are you talking about?
[210:07.25]Should I be a thief?
[210:17.05]I'll be a gnome thief.
[210:18.72]Lawful... How does that make sense?
[210:28.61]Okay.
[210:29.47]I like it.
[210:30.39]Okay, I'm good.
[210:41.88]I want this one.
[210:42.68]Uh, how about...
[211:01.14]Uh, we're gonna make it easy.
[211:14.01]Moderate?
[211:14.63]Fine.
[211:14.93]Gelled.
[211:19.03]Gelled.
[211:24.98]Gelled.
[211:30.17]Hold on, there are some pretty good ones, actually.
[211:32.37]I want this one instead.
[211:37.24]Okay, levels 15, well-fed, monster-themed variety, trap frequency few, potions available, poison... Okay, let's go.
[211:55.78]Is there actually RP or something?
[211:59.00]Is it actually role playing?
[212:08.17]I just punched.
[212:08.89]Okay, I have a punch.
[212:13.91]Okay, I get full health.
[212:23.40]That's creepy.
[212:23.76]Is he like a mushroom guy?
[212:31.11]What's the goal?
[212:34.45]Oh shit.
[212:42.52]Oh!
[212:44.20]I'm almost dead.
[212:44.92]What's the point of charisma?
[212:52.68]It's like Dark Souls and... Oh my god!
[212:57.33]Wait, what if I trade you two coupons for that sword?
[213:01.19]What does charisma even mean here?
[213:05.29]How am I still alive?
[213:08.42]Okay, I got him.
[213:11.32]Do I have any heals?
[213:12.10]Alright, drink it.
[213:26.32]Can I look... I can't jump down?
[213:27.38]He's got gear!
[213:38.58]Boots!
[213:41.22]Oh dude!
[213:43.12]What is going on?
[213:46.52]What was that?
[213:49.34]What was that?
[213:55.59]Okay, this dagger is... How do I equip the boots?
[213:58.79]Did that even do anything?
[214:22.44]That scared me.
[214:28.46]I got boots now, do I move faster?
[214:30.24]What's that?
[214:41.37]A ring.
[214:41.75]Are there any properties on it?
[214:44.19]How do I put it on?
[214:56.71]I didn't even see a stat increase.
[215:00.01]I just threw it on the ground.
[215:13.37]This is a great song.
[215:30.01]Oh shit, another one of these people.
[215:38.45]Oh shit, this is bad.
[215:40.64]I'm dead.
[215:48.40]OK.
[215:53.02]Choose character.
[215:53.96]I think maybe it's been a shit character.
[215:56.54]How about this fighter?
[216:01.56]Is it randomly generated?
[216:02.68]That'd be kind of cool.
[216:06.60]Is that it's easy?
[216:18.96]I think it is random.
[216:19.82]Am I crazy or is this a little different?
[216:33.83]Oh, rations.
[216:34.97]Cloak?
[216:41.72]Put it on the head?
[216:44.58]Back?
[216:50.06]I wonder if you can sell it at the end of the dungeon.
[216:51.56]Is this death?
[217:04.77]Just gonna mace.
[217:05.35]Let's go.
[217:05.65]Oh shit.
[217:32.03]I'm missing?
[217:34.23]Way more damage.
[218:03.29]Notice that I've heard this song before.
[218:06.49]Where?
[218:12.49]Teleporter.
[218:18.81]What does that get me?
[218:23.17]Secret door?
[218:23.79]No.
[218:25.95]What's the point of that?
[218:27.85]Escape route?
[218:30.21]I heard it in the club.
[218:35.10]It's a pretty awesome club.
[218:50.84]Something just ran up on me.
[218:51.90]What is going on?
[218:59.53]I hear loud banging.
[219:12.31]watch it there's a long cooldown on this swing
[219:32.56]Do you have experience or something?
[219:33.72]Look at all this loot, dude.
[219:39.24]Look at all the loot in this room.
[219:50.10]Where is all that stuff?
[219:53.50]Shit.
[220:03.67]hit him what does charisma do here yeah I don't I don't know that's probably better cast protection from poison
[220:43.04]Doing a lot better than last time.
[220:51.55]Can I look at a bigger map?
[220:52.81]That's all I got to work with.
[221:10.28]This is a teleporter.
[221:13.35]Why is this the last time ever
[221:16.14]Well, this is just one of the last times I've probably played 3DO.
[221:20.10]But look at all that we got out of it.
[221:22.08]Look at all the content that was here.
[221:25.47]It's like 40 or 50 games, right?
[221:28.21]We're talking about seven or eight games per stream.
[221:30.17]Streamed it probably like seven or eight times.
[221:33.45]40 different cool experiences.
[221:36.43]Well, let's call it 26 different very cool experiences.
[221:48.55]I've wanted to do this for a while.
[221:49.57]I looked in the closet and I was like, you know what?
[221:52.89]I'm into it.
[221:53.81]I want to play a bunch of 3DO.
[221:55.77]That's exactly what I did.
[222:04.40]Leave off any other adjectives and just call them experiences.
[222:13.21]Now, you guys might have heard of Demolition Man back in the early 90s.
[222:17.04]It was revolutionary.
[222:20.30]Everyone sat around the TV and everyone cheered at those Mortal Kombat fight sequences.
[222:26.52]And when Junior finally did it, Dad just started clapping.
[222:34.15]Almost dead.
[222:50.45]Good job, son.
[222:56.11]How much was that game?
[222:59.64]Uh, $75.
[222:59.88]Oh, and how much was the console?
[223:04.78]Uh, $700.
[223:04.96]How much is a movie ticket to go see Demolition Man, son?
[223:11.26]Uh, six bucks.
[223:14.26]What the fuck did I do?
[223:15.36]What the fuck am I doing?
[223:30.81]I'm just walking in a circle.
[223:36.81]View map, L and C at same time.
[223:39.65]Whoa, that person just saved the stream.
[223:42.29]Okay.
[223:43.98]I need help.
[224:01.29]Open door with a key.
[224:02.05]There's nothing in here.
[224:04.57]Randomly generated.
[224:06.27]Randomly generated nothing.
[224:10.59]Why did I waste a key on that?
[224:19.96]What is on the ground over here?
[224:23.96]Key.
[224:25.08]Can I eat this?
[224:27.67]Ooh, damn it.
[224:30.60]Only what does it work like Minecraft?
[224:33.04]Do I regen?
[224:35.50]What is coming up on my heart here?
[224:41.72]Is there a rest?
[224:47.51]I don't think so.
[224:49.93]Oh, there is OK camp.
[224:56.77]Yeah, alright, let's go.
[225:02.19]Up here and left.
[225:02.79]This was a fun one.
[225:20.52]Yeah, this is this is great.
[225:23.00]Remember teleport yourself back into the early 90s.
[225:28.74]You get a sword.
[225:29.66]You get to carry a big weapon.
[225:31.60]There are potions.
[225:33.94]There are big scary enemies.
[225:42.01]You just ate a handful of gushers.
[225:52.71]This is more approachable than King's Field is.
[225:56.93]Is it worth playing those games?
[225:58.23]I've always wanted to try them, but never had the opportunity to.
[226:03.79]Aren't there 10 of them?
[226:11.73]Looks pretty good, what is that?
[226:17.26]Bow and arrow?
[226:20.58]No, key.
[226:24.62]The later ones are pretty good.
[226:30.64]I've never played them, but I'm going to say yes because it makes me look cool.
[226:35.00]They're fantastic, actually.
[226:39.28]What are they on?
[226:40.44]PlayStation 1?
[226:49.55]PS2?
[226:49.79]Yeah, both.
[226:52.17]Okay, cool.
[226:52.81]I've been on a super old game kick recently.
[226:59.59]Probably Telephone.
[227:03.79]Oh, yep.
[227:13.92]Ster and I are going to do the game awards.
[227:21.18]And I don't think I played three games that came out in 2024.
[227:30.73]I'm serious.
[227:31.33]I don't even think three games that came out this year I played.
[227:40.40]Balatro, Withering Rooms.
[227:46.12]I think that's all anybody needs.
[227:47.18]Elden Ring, yeah, but I mean, that's... Use?
[227:51.25]Hold on, is this like a Super Mushroom?
[227:55.21]18 damage to Swing now.
[227:59.79]Alright, use it.
[228:02.49]Ooh.
[228:20.93]Play talk Stalker 2.
[228:25.16]UFO 50 yeah.
[228:28.34]Elden Ring UFO 50.
[228:31.20]The Elden Ring came out.
[228:34.80]Elden Ring DLC is it's it's it was great.
[228:38.15]Elden Ring DLC, Balatro, Withering Rooms, UFO 50.
[228:43.52]I think those are actually the only games I played in 2024.
[228:48.34]Those are the best games that came out in 2024.
[228:50.60]An indie game called Lunasid inspired by Kingsfield.
[229:02.91]I actually own it.
[229:04.27]I think I own that already.
[229:07.89]Maybe I'll have to look into it.
[229:18.88]What about Astro Bot?
[229:23.40]I didn't even play it.
[229:25.48]I heard people said it was good.
[229:26.42]Okay, that's new.
[229:31.61]Check out Kingsfield 1 and 2 someday.
[229:33.35]You know what?
[229:33.65]I probably will.
[229:37.48]I got hit by that.
[229:46.41]I made it to the next level.
[229:50.75]I killed almost everything.
[230:02.23]How did you find Withering Rooms?
[230:04.65]It was on the PlayStation Store.
[230:07.85]And I was just going through new things that came out.
[230:11.18]Wait, am I dying?
[230:12.08]For what?
[230:15.72]I was looking at the new releases on the PlayStation Store.
[230:18.94]I was like, what is this?
[230:20.68]And I was just very... I don't think I can attack that.
[230:27.56]I cannot.
[230:36.85]Did you play mouthwashing?
[230:45.27]Yeah, I keep hearing about it, but I don't know.
[230:49.11]Probably not.
[230:52.72]I keep hearing about it.
[231:04.82]Please do it.
[231:07.16]Yeah, I mean, it's a horror game, right?
[231:08.82]If I was doing a horror game night, maybe, I don't know.
[231:24.41]He must obey us.
[231:28.44]No, I don't.
[231:29.92]I don't have to do anything.
[231:41.14]Maybe we'll save it.
[231:41.56]Maybe like horror games.
[231:42.82]I don't know.
[231:44.44]I don't have a plan.
[231:45.78]Now that the 3DO is over, I got no plans.
[231:50.09]There you go.
[231:50.53]I think that's it.
[231:51.11]I think that's a good place to stop.
[231:52.83]I don't have any more games.
[231:54.29]That was the 3DO.
[232:00.68]Got through pretty much all of them.
[232:05.89]You're going to go through your notes.
[232:07.15]I'll talk about that very briefly here for a second.
[232:09.11]So I want to, you know, every time I've talked about writing a tweet down and then not doing it, I do a lot of note taking.
[232:17.92]Whether it's random, oh, I have an idea or something.
[232:20.48]Oh, this thing I thought was kind of interesting or funny.
[232:22.38]I kind of just write it down.
[232:24.00]I was thinking of doing a stream where I just compiled them and we just go over all of them.
[232:29.68]Here's the thing.
[232:31.30]Those of you that have seen Silicon Valley before, uh,
[232:35.98]I don't want to spoil that whole show, but there's a scene in Silicon Valley where there's a bunch of people that are really excited to hear all these ideas that their company has.
[232:47.33]And they are very excited to tell all of them to this other group.
[232:51.93]And I'm kind of sitting there going, wait a minute, am I just going to get Silicon Valley'd here?
[233:01.06]Yeah, I want to show a bunch of notes.
[233:12.41]Hey, can you extend the stream for five minutes?
[233:26.86]I'm downloading something and don't have social media.
[233:41.16]You should be happy about that.
[233:46.60]Jerma, we just want content.
[233:48.36]I'm still around, don't worry.
[233:57.39]More infomercial streams?
[233:58.39]I don't know.
[234:02.19]I can tell you what is coming up next.
[234:04.53]And that is Game Awards.
[234:06.77]That's probably the next time you'll see me.
[234:12.84]After the Game Awards, I got a lot of stuff just to kind of play randomly.
[234:18.42]Although obviously the holidays are coming up too, so I don't know how active I'm going to be for a while, but I'll see you at least on the 12th.
[234:30.19]Game Awards is the 12th, right?
[234:39.11]I don't know.
[234:39.83]Go ask Ster about it.
[234:42.07]Old PC games?
[234:42.82]Yeah, I'm sure I'll do some of that stuff too.
[234:45.58]I'm having fun just messing around, doing stuff.
[234:48.58]December 12th, okay.
[234:51.34]Is Ster playing PoE right now?
[234:53.04]Did he actually get in?
[234:53.92]Or is the server not even online?
[235:03.35]Is he in?
[235:04.19]He's in!
[235:09.72]Alright, we're gonna raid Ster.
[235:14.36]I'm gonna raid at somebody in like fucking 16 months.
[235:18.17]Is this how you even still do it?
[235:20.39]Alright, we're gonna raid Ster.
[235:25.69]And I want you to all give him never-ending build advice until he bans every single one of you.
[235:35.02]Don't actually do that.
[235:36.02]Don't be annoying.
[235:46.79]But yeah, let's raid Ster.
[235:48.87]He's doing like a big POE stream, I guess.
[235:53.48]And oh, get those primes ready.
[235:56.22]Get those primes ready for Ster.
[235:59.26]Prime it up.
[236:00.06]Here we go.
[236:00.70]Get those primes ready.
[236:02.06]Oh, dude, let's go.
[236:12.01]If you got a prime, drop it on Ster.
[236:17.40]Right when we get there!
[236:18.30]Yeah, I'll see you guys on the 12th.
[236:26.83]Game Awards.
[236:29.65]Guys, it's just gonna be me and Ster just gonna talk shit to each other for two hours while both of us don't even watch the trailers for the games we're not going to play.
[236:38.46]It's gonna be
[236:46.83]Dr. Hauser, you need to... Alright, I'm going to go look this up and it's going to be a jump scare.
[236:51.33]This person is going to get me like four hours from now.
[236:55.61]You are going to get me.
[236:57.17]I'm going to look this up.
[236:57.83]It's going to be a jump scare and you're going to scare me four hours from now while I'm in the bathroom.
[237:00.65]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[237:09.35]Thanks for watching.
[237:09.89]Thanks for hanging out, obviously.
[237:12.13]See you soon.
[237:12.77]Take care.
[237:16.31]And go prime it up to Ster.
[237:26.76]Trust me, it's worth plugging your 3DO back into.
[237:29.28]Oh, I think we, I think they're gone.
[237:30.36]Alright, see you later.
[237:34.66]Alright, bye.
[237:36.10]Everyone's gone.
[237:36.66]There's like nobody here anymore.
[237:37.66]So see you later.
