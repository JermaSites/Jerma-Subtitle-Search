[03:45.83]Voice work?
[03:47.43]I don't really do that much of voice acting anymore.
[03:50.83]I'm sort of preoccupied by...
[03:54.43]By the like random shit in my life and there's all these video productions that I want to do like voice work is kind of taking a backseat.
[04:00.96]I really wanted to get into it like a couple of years ago, like three or four years ago.
[04:04.56]But we'll see.
[04:06.52]You know what?
[04:08.10]Send me a Twitch message with some more details.

[04:39.13]Thank you.
[04:41.33]Now, while we have a second here, let's explain a few things.
[04:45.57]First of all, short stream tonight.
[04:48.78]moderately average stream tomorrow and then Saturday is when I'm going to do the Christmas decoration stream you know the one I've been talking about for like a week the one where my whole room is not going to get broken the Jerma destroys this entire office not happening but it's happening it's happening on Saturday so I figured because there you guys only got um
[05:15.71]Well, I'm not delaying the Christmas stream.
[05:17.39]I'm adding a second.
[05:18.37]Here, listen.
[05:19.39]I didn't stream last week on Thursday.
[05:22.78]And I never did a makeup stream for it.
[05:24.32]So, think of Saturday and, like, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[05:28.22]One of these streams is the makeup stream.
[05:29.92]And I'm not gonna stream on Christmas Eve.
[05:33.79]So, that's just the way it is.
[05:38.57]Can't wait for the Jerma Ruins Christmas stream.
[05:40.65]I'm not going to do that!
[05:43.62]I told you, I made like a fucking guaranteed bet that that was not going to fucking happen.
[05:51.81]I'm by far your favorite internet clown.
[05:53.37]Well, that's good.
[05:55.53]And speaking, here, listen.
[05:57.99]Speaking of Christmas, makeup tutorial stream.
[06:02.11]No, don't do this shit.
[06:03.13]You guys make this joke every time.
[06:05.34]Come on, new material.
[06:07.80]Anyways, there's a very, very interesting thing we can talk about here.
[06:12.94]And I can show you for a minute or two.
[06:15.34]So, hold on.
[06:16.56]Let me, like... This is some weird shit you're about to see.
[06:20.44]I'm not gonna lie.
[06:24.08]I'm not gonna get over it.
[06:24.91]Well, I might.
[06:26.97]Wait, hold on.
[06:29.37]Let there be light.
[06:29.95]You ready?
[06:34.07]Hey!
[06:34.17]Look at that!
[06:35.03]Who's that boy right there?
[06:38.08]Going to see Star Wars.
[06:39.74]The Force Unleashed tonight.
[06:41.90]That's right.
[06:43.36]Yeah, I know there's something back there.
[06:45.38]I know.
[06:45.82]You know, because I put it there.
[06:48.38]There's something.
[06:49.54]No, the room has to be clean.
[06:52.44]You understand?
[06:52.94]If I'm going to do, there's not a dead body in the corner.
[06:56.84]Listen.
[06:58.12]I'm going to show you something.
[06:59.76]Listen to me.
[07:00.36]Look at me.
[07:01.08]Look at me.
[07:01.42]My pants are on.
[07:02.26]My shoes are tied.
[07:04.33]Tree's going to go right here on Saturday.
[07:06.15]You know what I'm saying?
[07:06.97]Tree goes here.
[07:08.65]I'm going to decorate a tree sitting right here.
[07:11.20]I have all kinds of lights.
[07:13.20]I've got like a bunch of stuff that's gonna go on the ceiling.
[07:16.92]I might put a camera over here too.
[07:18.50]I'm not sure.
[07:20.27]But the room had to be cleaned up.
[07:23.07]Otherwise, how the hell am I gonna decorate a fucking Christmas tree in here?
[07:27.95]Anyways, there's a story behind this fucking thing.
[07:32.23]Because I don't know where it came from.
[07:33.99]I don't know who fucking sent it to me.
[07:36.33]So I got a door, a ding dong.
[07:39.27]I got a ding dong at my door.
[07:41.67]And there was a package, a fucking huge box sitting on my doorstep.
[07:46.55]And it fucking scared the shit out of me.
[07:47.95]It took me three people.
[07:49.49]It took me, Kim, and one of my other friends to get this into the house.
[07:53.51]It's fucking extremely heavy.
[07:56.71]There's no return address on it.
[07:58.69]So I don't know where it came from.
[07:59.91]But are you ready to see what the fuck is under here and how scary this is?
[08:03.70]Look at this.
[08:07.28]And there he is, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:12.11]Who fucking sent this to me?
[08:17.65]I don't like it's a giant fucking Santa Like this thing has to sit back and like I don't know who fucking gave it to I don't know where it came from Look at how big this thing is like I think it's like six or seven feet tall You know, it's fucking huge
[08:39.48]But I figured, like, alright, so I have, like, the Christmas dream going, right?
[08:43.71]So you got a big fucking weird ugly Santa over here.
[08:47.41]And then you got the Christmas tree.
[08:48.69]Like, it's a perfect combination, right?
[08:51.39]I already am doing a decoration stream.
[08:53.19]Might as well start.
[08:53.97]It's fucking seven feet tall!
[08:57.96]I can't lift him up.
[08:59.10]He's too heavy.
[09:01.10]But regardless, there he fucking is.
[09:06.58]That's not two feet.
[09:08.38]Whatever.
[09:09.16]Anyways.
[09:13.48]Let's get over it.
[09:14.27]Move this.
[09:20.57]I will drop this down.
[09:24.51]There.
[09:29.87]Ruins Christmas.
[09:30.79]I'm not ruining Christmas.
[09:34.82]Get over it.
[09:36.98]Although there has been like, honestly, there's been like at least two or three times where I have walked into this room and that's a fucking person.
[09:45.04]You know what I mean?
[09:45.50]Like you open the door and you're like, Jesus fucking Christ, what is that fucking thing?
[09:49.97]I think it's like real.
[09:52.09]It's fucking creepy.
[09:55.79]Anyways, let's get over it.
[09:58.57]Why don't we get over it?
[10:02.28]Where is it?
[10:02.76]Get over it.
[10:04.28]Get over it.
[10:08.88]Can you see it?
[10:10.02]Oh, what the fuck.
[10:11.32]There we go.
[10:11.84]This is so loud.
[10:14.49]That's better.
[10:17.41]So you guys have like constant fucking... I have constant pressure.
[10:21.75]Somebody is watching me at all times.
[10:25.95]Has it appeared in your dreams?
[10:27.01]No, not yet.
[10:27.69]But it's weird nonetheless.
[10:29.67]Alright, so I gotta... I forget how you play the game.
[10:34.49]Why does this look like shit?
[10:41.54]Is this, like, a lower resolution for some reason?
[10:47.12]I don't know.
[10:48.74]And, like, I didn't even fucking go to the bathroom.
[10:51.59]I'm such a fucking terrible streamer, I swear to God.
[10:53.63]Like, I start my streams and then, like, oh, let me turn my stream on.
[10:59.21]And then go to the bathroom.
[11:00.94]Like, on stream.
[11:02.16]Let's go down.
[11:08.04]I want to at least get to where I was before.
[11:09.24]Like, I only got like an hour or two to stream, so... Only an hour.
[11:16.00]Just about.
[11:16.44]And I'm sorry about that, but I'm going to see the fucking Force Awakens.
[11:19.68]Now, what's the name of the new movie?
[11:23.58]The Long Con, what's it called?
[11:25.32]The Last Jedi.
[11:26.82]There it is.
[11:27.77]Santa's scary.
[11:29.97]Yeah.
[11:31.35]Tell me about it.
[11:34.15]Tell me about it.
[11:35.09]Why is this running like shit?
[11:38.79]I don't know.
[11:41.01]Let me line this up.
[11:43.75]I'm doing much better than I was last time I played this.
[11:46.11]So that's good.
[11:49.69]Easy does it.
[11:52.87]And... Up and over?
[11:54.89]Up and over, right?
[11:55.64]Up and... I gotta figure out why this is running like crap.
[12:06.97]You know, I haven't played this game in, like, a week, so I gotta get my, like, I gotta get my blood ready for it, you know what I'm saying?
[12:12.50]Some people love it, some people hate it.
[12:14.26]Well, that's okay.
[12:18.22]Ooh, there we go.
[12:21.40]Let me get, like, to the, like, a stopping point and then go to the bathroom.
[12:24.36]Like, I'm really sorry that I'm, like, that much of a piece of shit.
[12:27.90]But I have to go to the fucking bathroom.
[12:29.88]Let me get, like, over the coffee.
[12:31.74]Let me get over the fucking Dunkachino and I'll go from there.
[12:40.54]There it is.
[12:43.48]Easy does it.
[12:48.17]Here we go.
[12:48.67]Actually, I don't think I'm going to get it from here.
[12:53.19]Oh, shit!
[12:53.89]Alright, I'm going to the fucking bathroom.
[12:55.83]I need to pee first.
[12:57.94]Let me pee.
[13:00.02]I'll be right fucking back.
[13:01.26]I have to go to the bathroom.
[13:03.84]I can't play this game on a full bladder.
[13:07.26]Just give me a minute.
[13:14.07]Where's my fucking BRB screen?
[13:15.70]There.
[13:17.14]I'll be right back.
[14:06.36]in that box for a while.
[14:09.06]Hello, boys and girls.
[14:19.13]It's me, Santa.
[14:21.05]Shh, quiet.
[14:22.31]I'm keeping my eyes on Gemma to make sure he's been a good boy this year.
[14:26.67]I'll be watching until Christmas Eve, so don't blow my cover.
[14:31.58]Let me remember before.
[14:33.46]One second.
[14:56.83]Okay.
[15:09.01]Fucking door.
[15:11.24]Hello!
[15:15.22]Uh, where are we?
[15:16.92]Where'd I go?
[15:19.50]Right there, right?
[15:20.04]There we go.
[15:21.08]Okay.
[15:24.00]Here we go.
[15:26.79]I swear to God, like, if I don't, like, rush piss, like, I can't, it's not gonna work.
[15:31.04]It's not gonna happen.
[15:35.04]Why, what are you guys doing?
[15:38.62]Shush.
[15:41.53]What are we shushing?
[15:47.95]Oh no, the Santa moved!
[15:49.80]Yeah, okay.
[15:51.00]That's, of course it did.
[15:53.16]I actually did, like, I do fucking think he moves sometimes.
[15:56.30]It's like the, it's the weird part about this whole thing.
[16:00.82]Fucking weird thing.
[16:02.36]Alright, let's go.
[16:04.34]Uh, back to it!
[16:08.68]Now I can actually, now I actually have resolution.
[16:12.23]Weirdly enough.
[16:15.87]Mm-hmm.
[16:22.48]This way.
[16:23.02]Sweats loudly?
[16:27.38]Yeah, because of the fucking game.
[16:33.24]Come down here.
[16:39.44]There it is.
[16:40.28]Oh, okay, we're good.
[16:45.77]I have so much trouble with this spot right here.
[16:47.25]I really do.
[16:53.12]Straight up, maybe?
[16:54.24]No.
[16:56.00]I gotta move this a little.
[16:57.44]Sorry about the... You're gonna hear a little bit of a bing here.
[16:59.82]It's like it was not in the right place earlier.
[17:02.91]I'm gonna move it.
[17:04.05]There we go.
[17:05.93]Sorry.
[17:06.41]I'm so sorry.
[17:07.07]You guys are probably hearing terrible noises.
[17:10.03]There we go.
[17:13.29]Oh my fucking god.
[17:14.21]Alright.
[17:21.23]Of all the games that I could play to just relax for a fucking hour, why would I choose this one?
[17:26.63]Why wouldn't I play anything else?
[17:31.24]I haven't even practiced.
[17:32.96]You guys are watching me practice again.
[17:44.79]I hate this fucking game.
[17:47.98]This is one of those games where you have to put like 500 hours in to play it, even for fucking 10 minutes.
[17:57.46]Like, I don't know what the fuck I was thinking.
[18:00.46]Why would I play this?
[18:05.89]Fucking stupid ass game.
[18:07.13]Like, fuck this goddamn game.
[18:13.97]I'm going to see, like, the fucking goddamn Star Wars movie.
[18:16.47]I'm, like, dressed for it already.
[18:17.91]Like a creepy dickhead Santa back here.
[18:22.87]No, get in the holiday spirit.
[18:25.79]That's not the holiday spirit.
[18:31.05]Get fucking happy.
[18:32.20]You're not supposed to... What, are you going to be like a Scrooge McDuck here?
[18:36.62]No.
[18:36.80]You're not going to be a Scrooge McDuck.
[18:41.58]Just because you are so excited to see what happens to Luke Skywalker doesn't mean you have to, like, make a terrible fucking stream where you just complain about it and get over it.
[18:51.26]There we go.
[18:51.74]That's better.
[18:52.38]That's better.
[18:53.96]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[19:02.15]Slow the fuck down.
[19:10.49]I had it too.
[19:12.52]You think I'm gonna be able to do the, like, the slide right now?
[19:16.34]Not when I'm this impatient.
[19:18.93]No, you fucking dickhead.
[19:29.71]Up and over.
[19:30.67]Up and over.
[19:32.31]No, don't pull the thing.
[19:34.41]Keep it straight in the air.
[19:36.01]Just get up here.
[19:37.39]You're making me have, like, heartburn.
[19:45.33]Just stay right there.
[19:46.27]I wish there was a button I could press where I would just let it go.
[19:50.79]Speaking of let it go, I should probably play let it go right now.
[19:59.35]Stupid bullshit.
[20:05.19]There we go.
[20:06.21]Slow.
[20:07.63]Slow.
[20:08.99]Slow.
[20:10.93]Straight up and down.
[20:11.64]I'm going to get to a resting point.
[20:16.55]That's not a resting point.
[20:18.29]Excuse me.
[20:23.29]That's not... You have to do it from here.
[20:24.91]If you don't do it from here, then you're not going to get it.

[26:18.08]Why would Kim be eating fucking bread in my office?
[26:23.56]Weird.
[26:27.73]That's some weird shit.
[26:32.65]Who said what?
[26:33.19]Who said Otto?
[26:34.01]Somebody said bring Otto in here.

[26:39.63]Nobody said what?
[26:40.29]What are you talking about?
[26:43.71]This is my office.
[26:47.96]Somebody just asked me to bring Otto in here.
[26:49.58]And I'm like, sometimes he comes down here.
[26:51.42]He usually doesn't though.
[26:58.32]Why?
[26:58.70]What's with this pre-recorded thing?
[27:01.65]What's this pre-recorded joke you guys are doing right now?

[29:00.78]I can't.
[29:01.36]I can't do it.
[29:01.94]My brain is too small to do this part.
[29:04.50]I have to just freak out in here.
[29:10.36]I was putting my hands up to make a stupid joke.
[29:12.54]I was about to say huge brain.

[31:11.95]Don't overdo it.
[31:14.35]Easy.
[31:15.35]You can go right over this edge.
[31:16.65]I ain't fucking having that happen right now.
[31:20.81]Shoe in coffee.
[31:21.90]Yeah, put your shoe in a coffee.
[31:27.24]There it is.
[31:28.54]Oh, no, this part.
[31:29.20]I remember this part.
[31:30.04]This part makes me want to fucking puke.
[31:33.02]Although I'm kind of relaxed right now, so I'll be okay.
[31:48.03]Easy.
[31:48.13]Easy.
[31:51.16]I'm gonna be this guy for Halloween next year.
[31:53.86]It's a really easy costume.
[31:55.12]And everyone will think you're the man for doing it.
[31:56.66]You know how many people will think you're fucking so cool if you go to PAX in this thing?
[32:02.38]I'm gonna be the guy in the... I reach now.
[32:17.90]So what I wanted to say, now that I have everybody here, or mostly everybody here, is the Christmas decoration stream is not tomorrow.
[32:27.53]It's Saturday.
[32:29.13]I want to give you guys a makeup stream or two.
[32:32.31]Because I wasn't live.
[32:34.39]Plus, this stream is going to be short too, so I want to make sure I'm live for at least a reasonable amount of time tomorrow with like a normal stream.
[32:44.10]Not, um...
[32:45.19]Me just, like, picking a random game, being like, oh, I'll play this for an hour.
[32:48.13]Like, an actual... Maybe we'll start Metro tomorrow.
[32:51.05]And, like, get back to that after the holiday.
[32:58.80]Stay, stay, stay, stay!
[33:00.71]Why the fuck does that keep happening?
[33:07.16]Like, I've seen the speedruns for this game.
[33:09.00]I don't think those people are real people.
[33:11.00]I think those are pre-recorded people.
[33:13.29]You guys telling me, like, I'm running a pre-recorded stream for some fucking insane reason?
[33:17.33]That's not a real person.
[33:18.15]That's like a robot that beat this.
[33:21.73]Like, open that person up.
[33:23.85]There's fucking wires and shit in there.
[33:29.31]Like, open that guy's, like, face up and it's gonna be like... Like fucking robots and shit.
[33:43.14]It's gonna take me a thousand years to get over this Hey, that's why the name of the fucking game is titled get over it, huh?
[33:54.56]Oh You dick you
[34:03.51]Just waiting for, like, the guy that, like, did this... I'm waiting for the guy that beat this game in, like, three minutes to go accept the award at, like, the video game awards.
[34:12.18]He's gonna get up to the fucking podium, and he's gonna grab the award and be like, you know, I just want to say thank you for the... And then people are gonna be like, it's a fucking robot, I told you!
[34:20.60]And he's gonna, like, shut off.
[34:34.36]He's gonna be like, I just want to say thank you for the award.
[34:38.37]I much appreciate it.
[34:41.91]Gonna be like, fucking goddamn robots.
[34:44.67]Now I gotta concentrate here.
[34:47.93]Because this is gonna be bad if I don't.
[34:49.33]I'll be stuck here for the whole stream.
[34:57.42]I just have no patience.
[34:58.96]I have no patience.
[35:01.40]Absolute zero.
[35:02.92]Like, I want it now.
[35:04.64]You know what I mean?
[35:05.10]I don't want it, like, to take my time.
[35:07.00]I want it right fucking now.
[35:08.38]I want it right now.
[35:10.90]And that's not how this game works.
[35:12.52]You can't get it right now.
[35:13.50]You have to play a thousand hours of this game to get it.
[35:15.83]And I want it right now.
[35:18.59]Put your shoe on Etalyx.
[35:27.38]Fucking God.
[35:33.43]I hope The Last Jedi is good.

[35:52.67]I'm about to give up.
[35:57.27]I didn't even do that.
[36:19.87]Why?
[36:21.21]I just don't understand why.

[42:38.10]Get me out of here.
[42:54.39]Wow.
[43:02.56]Let's get back to where we were last time we played this game after the grill.
[43:07.62]Very nice.
[43:09.22]Not today.
[43:09.94]We get to go to the boxes and then try to climb the security cameras again.
[43:19.67]Won't that be a blast?
[43:22.71]Saved?
[43:23.11]Yeah.
[43:24.19]For real.
[43:26.77]Truly saved.
[43:27.71]Just stay up there.
[43:36.40]Don't freak out.
[43:37.10]Okay.
[43:38.02]This is where I gotta be careful.
[43:39.00]I fuck this up almost every time.
[43:45.08]So far, so good.
[43:45.94]Pull it closer.
[43:46.76]No, you!
[43:49.97]That's not what I wanted to do!
[43:59.68]You know the fucking problem that I have with this game?
[44:02.84]Is like... My arm and my hands just get too sweaty.
[44:09.83]Because you gotta... It's over.
[44:13.79]I ain't coming back from this one, I don't think.
[44:15.53]Yeah, I am.
[44:16.15]Shut up, Jeremy.
[44:17.85]Give it a rest.
[44:20.56]My hands get... Mom.
[44:22.58]My hands get so sweaty and disgusting.
[44:25.87]And this game is a game where you have to... You have to hold the mouse the whole time.
[44:29.73]You can't take your hand off the fucking mouse.
[44:31.97]This is the mouse.
[44:32.95]You got... It's the whole time.
[44:44.29]I don't get to take my hand off.
[44:54.82]Same deal.
[44:55.50]Do it again.
[45:01.12]Get up there and stay up there, buddy.
[45:10.51]Wait, prove there's somebody in the chat that's not a script.
[45:14.55]I'm not sure what you're talking about.
[45:20.69]Slow down, slow down, slow down.
[45:26.45]What are you thinking?
[45:27.35]What are you thinking, Jeremy?
[45:28.61]Just fucking stop.
[45:33.55]Fucking God damn it.
[45:55.28]Now I'm just trying to rush it.
[45:57.57]You can't rush this part.
[45:58.55]You really just can't.
[46:05.31]Help, I forget my line.
[46:07.51]Help, I don't remember my lines!
[46:09.80]That's a Twitch chatter!
[46:13.46]What do I think about Santa?
[46:16.08]Um... He spreads all kinds of joy.
[46:22.70]And... He's a very, very, very jolly man.
[46:30.77]He loves Coca-Cola.
[46:34.21]It's apparently his favorite drink.
[46:38.58]That wasn't enough.
[46:41.70]Maybe it was that.
[46:45.86]Will you just fucking latch onto that, please?
[46:49.20]Oh, you... I'm, like, sweating more than usual, I think.
[46:54.86]Every, like, 12 seconds, my hands are wet.
[46:57.72]Like, I need to...
[47:07.23]It's gonna be wet in about 10 minutes.
[47:15.53]Go fuck yourself.
[47:19.53]Go fuck yourself.
[47:20.01]Go fuck yourself.
[47:20.99]You'll be fine.
[47:44.87]I'm only, look, I'm only doing this, if I fall, if I fall all the way down, then I'm gone.
[47:49.31]And I'm gonna go see the fucking best lightsaber fight that they've ever, they've ever fucking recorded on the screen.
[47:57.96]Like, I'm just like, if I fall all the way down, I'm going to get, I'm going to lightsaber, I'm fighting somebody with a lightsaber.
[48:03.37]No, I'm going to what?
[48:06.49]Stop.
[48:07.25]Just relax and fucking try to get as high as you can.
[48:13.85]That's not relaxing, but it still works.
[48:19.52]A pre-recorded Star Wars labor.
[48:22.24]Labor?
[48:23.38]Labor.
[48:23.68]Oh, yeah, I can't wait to go watch, like, the new Star Wars movie.
[48:29.12]Somebody goes into labor.
[48:32.98]God.
[48:40.37]Every time.
[48:41.19]The fucking slide.
[48:42.67]Why couldn't that have been like a hook?
[48:49.31]Yeah, let's watch like the labor fight.
[48:51.33]Two people going to labor.
[48:52.41]Whoever has the baby first becomes the new Jedi.
[48:56.77]I'm just in a terrible fucking position right now.
[49:10.85]I'm just fucking flinging myself over there.
[49:17.91]I'll give up.
[49:18.59]Here we go.
[49:19.43]This is where you show the real strength.
[49:25.63]Oh, eat my fucking ass.
[49:29.29]I gotta pull closer with the slide because the slide has nothing to grab onto.
[49:34.46]It's just the thing that has to be in the game that's like stupidly impossible to grab onto.
[49:42.72]No.
[49:50.03]I'm agitated.
[49:50.99]I mean, I am a little agitated.
[49:52.31]That's what happens when you play this game.
[49:55.03]I don't think there's a way to play this game without being agitated.
[49:57.81]That's like the whole point of the game.
[50:00.29]The whole point of the game is just agitation.
[50:02.65]The name of the game.
[50:03.43]The narrator even makes fun of you because the game's fucking impossible.
[50:16.72]Oh, no.
[50:42.77]Yeah.
[51:01.76]I do not need my eyes to see you, Jedi.
[51:20.82]It's an elegant weapon for a more civilized age.

[54:56.58]Oh, my God.
[54:57.20]I thought I was going to be able to throw myself over there.
[55:01.88]Unfortunately, not.
[55:03.13]Oh, well.
[55:11.59]There it is.
[55:12.35]Nice and smooth.
[55:15.04]Oh, the facecam's off.
[55:15.80]Whoops.

[55:20.56]And...
[55:25.44]Why is this a Christmas game?
[55:27.33]This is not a Christmas stream.
[55:29.49]He just, like, I opened him up today.
[55:33.79]He's like, this is not a Christmas stream.
[55:36.07]Just because there's a fucking weird Santa behind me doesn't mean it's a Christmas stream.
[55:40.09]The Christmas stream is Saturday.
[55:43.50]People see, like, the Santa Claus and they think it's time for Christmas.
[55:47.04]Christmas!
[55:52.22]What's behind the drapes?
[56:01.97]Nothing.
[56:04.52]There's nothing behind the drapes.
[56:11.04]Okay.
[56:12.36]What time is it?
[56:13.42]I said I was only going to stream for like an hour or so.
[56:15.02]This is a short stream because I got to go watch The Last Jedi.

[57:04.41]That game is so inva- Look, final thoughts about- I don't think I'm gonna play that game again, but final thoughts on that game.
[57:10.99]That game is really good.
[57:12.59]It's a really good game.
[57:13.55]It tests your strength.
[57:14.89]It tests your mental fortitude.
[57:16.45]If you can handle it, good for you.
[57:18.04]I hope you can.
[57:18.88]I hope you can fucking beat it in four minutes and then prove to us that you're a human.
[57:21.76]I don't believe it for a second, but it's okay.
[57:23.68]You can still try.

[57:50.94]Because I got over it.
[57:52.01]I got over it.
[57:52.51]I don't want to play it anymore.
[57:55.07]I got over it.
[58:00.75]It's 104 in England.
[58:02.01]It's because you're in a different country.
[58:04.84]And guess what?
[58:05.36]They don't even have Dunkachinos over in England.
[58:08.38]It's pretty good shit.
[58:14.16]Anyways.
[58:14.42]Let me move some things over here.
[58:18.11]This.
[58:19.59]So excited for this movie.
[58:21.25]I heard it was really fucking good too.
[58:28.25]England is a city.
[58:30.17]It is.
[58:32.97]New England.
[58:34.09]That's not a city either.
[58:35.75]England is a country.
[58:37.50]I almost said state.
[58:41.98]That was mean.
[58:42.54]What was mean?
[58:48.34]England is a state.
[58:50.82]It's a state of Europe.
[58:56.19]England, Britain, Great Britain, the country Great Britain.
[59:01.63]New England is an area of the United States of America.
[59:10.96]America is the country.
[59:12.98]New England is the area.
[59:14.58]Massachusetts is the state.
[59:23.48]Great Britain isn't a country.
[59:26.34]What are you talking about?
[59:28.15]What are you talking about?
[59:29.11]What?
[59:29.37]I'm going to look.
[59:34.99]Great Britain.
[59:39.64]Great Britain, also known as Britain.
[59:43.40]is a large island in the North Atlantic Ocean of the northwest coast of continental Europe.
[59:48.72]With an area of 200,009 kilometers, Great Britain is the largest of the British Isles, the largest European island, and the ninth largest island in the world.
[60:01.18]They haven't said country yet.
[60:05.00]In 2011, the island had a... Why do they keep saying island?
[60:13.55]Why do they keep saying island and not country?
[60:17.11]Is Great Britain not a sovereign country?
[60:24.62]Country.
[60:29.36]A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography.
[60:38.01]Is Britain a country?
[60:40.71]Yes, it is.
[60:41.21]Why am I typing this into Google?
[60:44.91]The United Kingdom is in itself a country that is made up of England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
[60:55.59]Wait, hold on.
[60:55.85]Its official name is United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
[61:12.06]The capital of the UK is London.
[61:14.70]Great Britain's in there as a country.
[61:16.16]It's the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
[61:18.74]Great Britain is a country.
[61:19.58]It says it right there.
[61:30.61]I love how, is Britain a country?
[61:34.51]Is England a country?
[61:36.65]The UK...
[61:38.52]No, wait a minute.
[61:39.29]This says the United Kingdom comprises four countries.
[61:43.69]England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
[61:46.79]It is a country.
[61:48.67]Get out of here.
[61:49.63]Get out of here.
[61:50.29]Get out of this.
[61:50.99]Get out of my mind.
[61:51.93]Get out of my fucking mind.
[61:55.92]Great Britain is not three countries.
[61:58.94]UK is made up of four countries.
[62:06.39]Compromise a compromise for Christ's sake fucking welcome to mind freak I Almost just poured this on myself.
[62:15.13]I am was just like what like this and like the holes over here, and it was like dumped it on me But Great Britain is Great Britain is not one country.
[62:27.35]It's an island but but like I Don't know I don't know what you guys talking about
[62:36.20]In Wikipedia right now, there's countries of the United Kingdom.
[62:41.88]I'll put it in chat.
[62:44.82]The country is in the UK.
[62:47.31]England is a country.
[62:48.55]We're done with this.
[62:51.75]We're done with this.
[62:56.99]We're done with that.
[62:58.25]For a second, I thought that was my saved password.
[63:01.50]Good thing I wasn't just copying and pasting that over and over again.
[63:17.41]Wikipedia is not a valid source.
[63:19.49]What are you, a fucking college professor?
[63:21.33]What do I need to put some citations in the footnote for you?
[63:32.22]How did getting over it go?
[63:33.46]Just as good as you would think.
[63:39.88]Wikipedia hates England.
[63:43.96]I'm missing the point.
[63:44.92]No, I'm just fucking dicking around.
[63:46.74]I'm just wasting time until I get to see... I'm just wasting a little bit of time before I get to see... For many people all over the world, Vader was the personification of evil, and Luke was the hero we all loved when this film came out.
[64:06.23]Yeah!
[64:08.80]Hey, what do you think, Santa?
[64:13.15]Good shit, huh?
[64:13.97]I think this is so fucking creepy.
[64:19.65]Ah, we got bits to read.
[64:21.79]Yes, we do.
[64:24.11]First of all, thank you so much, everybody, for sticking around.
[64:25.61]This was a very short stream.
[64:27.57]This is not what we typically do around here, but it is the holidays.
[64:32.82]And I got like some family obligations to tend to.
[64:35.68]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[64:36.98]Family obligations.
[64:37.62]Yeah, I'm going to see Star Wars, but still like I'm going with my family.
[64:41.27]It's like a Christmas movie thing.
[64:42.81]We go see a Christmas movie, even though it's not... We go on Christmas time.
[64:46.83]Not Christmas time, like before Christmas.
[64:49.93]Leading up to Christmas.
[64:54.90]But anyways, let me read some bits.
[64:56.60]Thank you for sticking around, by the way.
[64:58.24]I'll be live tomorrow.
[65:00.02]And Saturday.
[65:00.82]Saturday is the decoration stream.
[65:03.02]Don't miss Saturday's stream.
[65:04.20]You're not going to want to.

[65:20.53]There were a lot of bits in like an hour.
[65:21.85]God damn, that's a lot.
[65:24.99]Sir Feline, thank you.
[65:27.55]I think I already got these all the way up until... Yeah, I got this one.
[65:31.78]I think we'll start here.
[65:35.00]Yeah.
[65:36.04]Alessia Genova, thanks for the $5.
[65:36.96]Hi, Jerma.
[65:38.44]Was it hard to voice act for Apotheon and how long did that take you?
[65:43.33]The Apotheon session was, I think,
[65:48.19]It was like probably an hour or so.
[65:49.59]Like 45 minutes of recording.
[65:51.87]It wasn't that long.
[65:52.79]I did like two lines.
[65:53.91]I did like three lines.
[65:55.57]It was not even less.
[65:56.45]It was probably less than like 40 or 30 minutes to get them.
[66:00.40]That was fun though.
[66:01.86]That game is pretty good too.
[66:04.48]Cryptark was a lot longer.
[66:05.50]Cryptark was a few sessions.
[66:12.50]That was probably like two or three hours total of recording.
[66:16.00]If I remember correctly.
[66:18.46]Thank you though.
[66:21.20]Choji, thank you Choji boy for the $5.
[66:23.04]If you set up a tree instead of a star at the top, tape a picture of your face to a stick and shove it on top.
[66:29.65]There is gonna be a tree here.
[66:32.55]It's like a five foot tall tree.
[66:35.93]So I couldn't get like a fucking big tree back here.
[66:38.63]It wasn't gonna fit.
[66:39.19]There's no way it was gonna fit back here.
[66:41.67]I wanted to get like a big ass tree and like stuff it through the door and stay like a real tree.
[66:47.93]No.
[66:48.39]There's no way that was going to happen.
[66:50.59]So decorating a smaller tree in here.
[66:53.61]Yeah, it's a compact tree.
[66:58.55]I should probably put the... Let's just change this to IRL.
[67:03.48]Just for the time being.
[67:06.02]Because it would probably be another 20 minutes or so.
[67:09.34]I don't want people to get the wrong idea that I'm still playing that game.
[67:15.60]Uh, thank you, though.
[67:16.94]Thank you also to Matters of Darkness for the $5.
[67:20.17]Why don't you remember how you got Etalyx' corpse?
[67:22.85]Etalyx is in the chat right now.
[67:26.21]You think I, like, stole his account and has somebody, like, on it right now?
[67:29.77]You know, Etalyx, like, just... I talked to Etalyx, like, 10 minutes ago.
[67:33.34]No, like, an hour and 20 minutes ago.
[67:34.90]That would have been, like, 10 minutes before the stream.
[67:37.86]Uh, thank you, Matters of Darkness, though.
[67:39.02]Pina Chip, or Pina Chip, thanks for the $1, sit on Santa's lap.

[71:37.93]And then he said that you love the skits that I do.
[71:40.37]Well, I can tell you I'm not.
[71:43.06]I've not stoned every stream.
[71:46.93]I actually don't think I know.
[71:48.25]I don't mean I don't think I've never been stoned on stream.
[71:52.17]I don't get stoned.

[73:25.52]I don't know how that would work.
[73:28.66]How do you do a not real stream?
[73:30.16]How do you do a fake live broadcast?
[73:33.78]It's just a VOD.
[73:34.60]That's all it is.
[73:35.14]Hello, Elezza Genova.
[73:38.47]Again, thanks for $5.
[73:40.48]Love you, but these bits are not for you.
[73:42.00]They are for the Santa mannequin.
[73:44.32]Don't ask.
[73:44.78]You don't want to know.
[73:47.30]I will put $5 into Santa's pocket.
[73:50.70]Does it even have pockets?
[73:54.95]I don't think it has pockets.
[74:03.45]No.
[74:04.25]There's no pockets over here.
[74:08.97]Nope.

[75:08.14]No, I'm not.
[75:08.48]I got time.
[75:10.48]I ain't gonna miss the movie.
[75:11.34]I'm not missing this fucking movie.
[75:12.72]I've been waiting for 16 years to see this.
[75:16.03]This is the conclusion that I've been waiting for.
[75:18.41]I've been waiting for closure.
[75:20.21]I want to know, like, for instance, what happened to Yoda?
[75:24.54]What happened to Yoda?
[75:25.78]You know what I mean?
[75:27.42]We didn't get closure on what actually happened to Yoda in any of the movies.
[75:32.57]Like, did he run away?
[75:34.18]Did he, like, die in one of the wars?
[75:37.60]What happened to Yoda?
[75:45.12]Yoda... What do you mean?
[75:46.24]Yoda's dead.
[75:51.30]Return... I don't watch those old shit fucking 70s movies.
[75:55.17]Are you kidding me?
[75:57.29]They were made in, like, 1974.
[75:57.97]They're fucking trash.
[76:01.21]Why would I watch those?
[76:04.68]I just saw, like, from the... I watched episode 1, 2, and 3.
[76:07.36]You want to watch movies from, like, 1976?
[76:11.28]Hey, while I'm at it.
[76:13.80]Hey, why don't I get my fucking VCR and put in Casablanca while I'm at it, watching, like, old shit movies.
[76:19.91]Jesus, guys.
[76:20.57]Look at the guy I am.
[76:21.59]I hope they talk about what happened to Yoda, though.
[76:28.53]Because he's, like, he's in... They made... It's strange.
[76:30.91]So they made...
[76:33.50]Um, like as, as long as I've been alive, they made those movies, the one, two and three.
[76:39.42]And then there was, um,
[76:41.84]Those three, like, the movies that were, like, amateur fucking hour movies that, like, nobody, like, really likes.
[76:46.52]I didn't even give them a chance, because I heard, like, they're, like, TV, like, made-for-TV movie type shit, and I'm not gonna watch them.
[76:54.04]So, we just got rid of those.
[76:55.86]And then I, actually, I read, like, a, um, I read a Wikipedia article that described kind of what happened in those movies, and then jumped right onto The Force Awakens, because, I mean, it's, like, a new movie that I don't like old shit, so...
[77:12.87]That'll, you know, that's the way it is, I guess.
[77:20.31]Thank you to, uh... Thank you to... Crush... Crushker.
[77:29.54]Crushker for the $10 short.
[77:32.40]Get over it, stream, huh, title?
[77:34.48]We already know you're short.
[77:35.39]We got over it.
[77:37.47]Good.
[77:38.37]Thank you for the $10, dude.
[77:40.84]Max, Manus, thanks for the $1.
[77:42.42]Can we have a Santa stream until you come back?
[77:46.22]You want me to just leave the stream on?
[77:47.88]No.
[77:49.19]I'm turning it off and I'm getting out of here.
[77:50.81]Because I've got to catch this movie.
[77:52.39]But I will be live tomorrow.
[77:53.43]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[78:00.68]Thank you, though, dude.
[78:02.30]LaFerro, thanks for the $1.
[78:04.66]Friend, you are crazy.
[78:06.66]I've been told.
[78:07.68]Thank you also to Bang for the bits.
[78:10.68]Get the big soda tonight.
[78:11.98]It's two and a half hours.
[78:15.08]Uh-huh.
[78:15.98]I'm getting large fucking soda.
[78:19.04]I'm getting a big ass soda.
[78:20.85]And I'm going to get a box of those candies.
[78:23.01]I'm talking about the gross candies.
[78:24.53]Not like the candies that have absolutely been sitting in that display box for like eight years.
[78:29.47]You know what I'm talking about?
[78:30.73]Which candies am I talking about?
[78:34.84]What candies am I referring to the ones that no one eats and they've been there for like fucking 18 years?
[78:46.91]Nope.
[78:47.63]Come on, somebody get it.
[78:49.29]Nope.
[78:51.17]Nope.
[78:52.27]Somebody get it.
[78:54.49]Whoppers, baby.
[78:55.33]That's the one.
[78:56.23]Whoppers.
[78:58.51]Those things are gross.
[79:00.29]They're disgusting.
[79:01.65]Nobody fucking likes those.
[79:04.29]I eat those only at a movie theater.
[79:07.07]There's no other reason to eat them.
[79:10.53]They're absolutely disgusting, but I only consume them at the movies.
[79:18.78]They're crunchy, they're soft, they're sour, and they taste like fucking rotten fucking milk.
[79:26.10]They're terrible.
[79:28.66]But man, they last a long time.
[79:33.00]What is a Whopper?
[79:34.00]It's like a malted milk ball, but way worse.
[79:39.88]They're sour.
[79:44.10]They taste like they're stale.
[79:45.18]Yeah, I know.
[79:46.34]That's why you only came to the movie theater, because they're cheap, but they're on sale.
[79:50.36]And that's how you know that they're good.
[79:52.44]Milk duds also last a while, but milk duds are...
[79:55.53]They're chewy.
[79:57.05]I like crunchy at a movie theater, not chewy.
[80:00.35]If I want chewy... You know what?
[80:01.65]I'm going to bring a whole pizza.
[80:02.53]I'll tell you a story real quick.
[80:05.68]When Burgah Boy and I and friends of ours used to go to the movie theaters, our snacks, we would get like, oh, let's go and get something beforehand.
[80:15.90]Because you don't pay for snacks in the movie theater.
[80:17.98]You bring your own.
[80:19.08]You wear a big jacket and you stuff like...
[80:23.29]It's four bottles of water in here and like you put like a soda in your back pocket and you take a like a box of Reese's and you like stick it in your shirt and oh, yeah, excuse me.
[80:32.39]See you later.
[80:32.89]Thanks for the ticket.
[80:33.71]Right.
[80:33.93]So that's how we all eat at a movie theater.
[80:37.68]But Burgah Boy used to do this thing where instead of bringing his own snacks, he would bring his own full bag of McDoubles into the movie theater.
[80:48.04]At least like seven or eight were in a bag.
[80:50.88]That was what he ate for popcorn at the movies.
[80:53.61]So he'd have like a bag of fucking McDoubles in his jacket and he'd pull them out and just one by one during the movie would just snack on seven or eight fucking McDoubles over like an hour to two hour, like an hour and a half to two hour movie.
[81:09.02]It was fucking, it was actually, you know what?
[81:10.88]Like you could, like you can laugh about that.
[81:12.80]Like I laugh about it too.
[81:15.13]But man, that was awesome.
[81:16.15]It was fucking awesome.
[81:17.51]Just sitting there in the movie theater with like a double cheeseburger.
[81:20.89]Just, it was perfect.
[81:22.47]You could just sit like this, put your feet up.
[81:24.66]As long as you don't like leave any trash and it's not like disgusting, you take it with you, right?
[81:28.48]It was fucking gross, but it was great at the same time.
[81:34.06]And by the way, why is the movie theater like the fucking airport?
[81:39.85]I don't understand.
[81:42.15]Why are you not allowed to bring food into the movie theater?
[81:46.95]At the door, excuse me, sir.
[81:48.65]You're going to pay $8 for a medium soda.
[81:53.20]Why did we let that happen?
[81:56.56]That's where they make their money, but that doesn't make any sense.
[82:00.12]Why should they be allowed to do that?
[82:03.88]In what world where the movie theater that I'm going to go to is right here, right?
[82:12.75]Right there.
[82:14.49]Right here, like right here, like less than, you could walk and get there.
[82:19.27]It's like, it's like a little bit further down, but it's like right here.
[82:22.84]There is a convenience store.
[82:25.64]So why on fucking Earth?
[82:27.60]Like I can walk into here and get a bottle of soda for like two bucks or be right here in real estate, like fucking not even a 10th of a mile down the road and get a fuck the same soda for like $5.
[82:39.36]It's fucking capitalism, man.
[82:43.78]You know what I say?
[82:44.96]You know what I say we do?
[82:45.80]Increase the prices on everything.
[82:51.71]No, don't do that.
[82:52.29]What?
[82:52.57]No.
[82:52.87]No, no, no.
[82:53.49]Don't increase the price.
[82:54.57]We should lower the prices on everything.
[82:58.21]Not increase the prices on everything because that would mean that everybody would have to pay more.
[83:03.51]No, I mean deflate the prices.
[83:08.26]You guys thought I was going to go the other way with that.
[83:13.00]Is it a currency thing?
[83:13.99]Yeah, buy bald coin.
[83:16.59]Did I tell you about my naked on stream dream?
[83:22.57]Yeah, raise the minimum wage to $50 an hour and increase the prices of all goods 2,000%, right?
[83:29.80]So like if you buy a loaf of bread right now, it's like $4.
[83:33.82]But like in my world, in like the Jerma world, that loaf of bread would be like $41.
[83:40.45]But you'd be making like 80 bucks an hour.
[83:47.63]It's like the same fucking... We need a stat squish on that.
[83:52.42]It's like World of Warcraft.
[83:54.82]After, like, another 20 years.
[83:56.04]It's like, ah, it's like 15 trillion dollars for a loaf of bread.
[84:00.42]That literally doesn't do anything.
[84:06.69]That just, like, increases a decibel point.
[84:09.39]That's all it is.
[84:10.19]It's just... No, but... Okay, if, like, the minimum wage was, like, a hundred... Uh-oh.
[84:17.03]What time is it?
[84:20.44]Oh, I gotta go.
[84:21.28]I gotta go.
[84:21.82]I, like, missed the fucking... I'm gonna miss the movie.
[84:24.84]Hold on.
[84:29.74]Come on!
[84:35.05]I gotta get ready for the movie.
[84:38.31]Going fast speed now.

[85:06.60]Santa's gonna strangle you after you leave.
[85:08.88]I hope he doesn't.
[85:09.60]I don't think he's an inanimate object.
[85:10.86]I don't think it's possible.
[85:12.24]Uh, when is Santa gonna pop out of the Santa costume in the back?
[85:14.22]He's not.
[85:14.54]He's not here.
[85:15.10]He lives in a different state.
[85:16.73]Mostly lost.
[85:17.21]Thanks for the one dollar.
[85:18.21]Fuck, I forgot charity.

[85:41.57]Not Darth Vays.
[85:43.47]I want, like, Darth Vader quotes.
[85:48.61]Come on, I have to leave, like, right now.

[86:17.29]Just wanted to apologize.
[86:18.05]I think this is a pre-recorded stream.
[86:19.49]Screw the chat.
[86:20.39]It's not pre-recorded, as you can see.
[86:22.05]I'm currently watching a... Actually, I'm watching a pre-recorded image over here, but it's not me.

[86:55.86]Success and growth, man.
[86:57.40]Thank you.
[86:58.10]So glad you haven't let the success get to you.
[86:59.94]Still the same funny guy.
[87:00.93]Cheers.
[87:01.33]Cheers to you.
[87:01.93]Thank you so much, Longcat.
[87:06.66]Yes!
[87:07.22]Fucking, I'm getting so pumped.
[87:10.06]Uh, Jerma, don't see The Last Jedi.
[87:11.86]See Ferdinand.
[87:12.68]No, I'm not gonna go see Ferdinand.
[87:14.42]I'm gonna go see The Last Jedi.
[87:15.58]That's where he chokes the guy.
[87:23.04]That's where he fucking chokes him.
[87:24.18]Look.
[87:25.85]He's choking him.
[87:28.53]Snap.
[87:33.95]Alright, I'm gone.
[87:35.23]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[87:36.89]See you tomorrow.
[87:37.93]See you tomorrow.
[88:03.54]Nice Fucking love that
[88:33.66]You my friend all that's left of their religion I
[88:56.22]Obi-Wan is here.
[88:57.98]The Force is with him.
[88:59.78]If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.
[89:02.72]Escape is not his plan.
[89:04.56]I must face him alone.
[89:06.16]Yeah.
[89:09.00]I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan.
[89:11.58]We meet again at last.
[89:14.50]The circle is now complete.
[89:16.54]When I left you, I was left alone.
[89:18.68]Now I am the master.
[89:20.80]Don't let him fucking... Duck.
[89:23.34]Duck, duck.
[89:24.46]Nice.
[89:28.18]You're more powerful than you could possibly believe.
[89:35.63]One slash to the face.
[89:43.64]Jesus.
[89:58.50]Fucking love this movie.
[90:02.06]I haven't even seen this one.
[90:04.06]I already like it.
[90:08.30]Wait, what happened?
[90:08.78]What happens here?
[90:09.92]He fucking kills him?
[90:12.61]What?
[90:12.85]I thought... No, that's like a magician trick.
[90:22.35]He's still there.
[90:28.51]He's fucking dumb.
[90:29.51]Why does he die there?
[90:36.04]Are they away?
[90:37.54]They have just made the jump into hyperspace.
[90:40.66]This will be a day long remembered.
[90:43.22]It has seen the end of Kenobi.
[90:45.38]It will soon see the end of the rebellion.
[90:55.17]Oh shit, I gotta go!
[91:06.44]Oh god!
[91:07.56]What?
[91:08.16]I'm gonna be late to the fucking movie.
