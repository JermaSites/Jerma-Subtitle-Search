[01:17.56]I'm going to get this.
[01:49.06]I'm never doing that ever again.
[01:51.56]I'll never do it again.
[01:53.30]That was the worst thing I've ever done in my life.
[01:56.04]I ran out of food in the first two hours.
[02:07.57]My God.
[02:13.10]Let me tell you guys something.
[02:16.28]I have had a hellish week.
[02:19.15]An absolutely unbelievable week.
[02:22.01]First of all, I didn't even know it was like the Wild West out there.
[02:25.94]How was I supposed to know that?
[02:26.82]I didn't know it was like GTA up there, the bandits.
[02:31.66]Bright light city, gonna set my soul, gonna set my soul on fire.
[02:37.85]Got a whole ride for this race, so get those stakes up high.
[02:44.29]There's a thousand pretty women.
[02:46.39]There was a man that I met.
[02:48.82]We became really close friends.
[02:51.68]He ended up falling out of the balloon.
[03:03.15]I had to get rescued by two other balloons.
[03:05.31]You know when you go on a cruise ship?
[03:09.03]And the cruise ship goes around and you get to the certain waters where you can play casino games.
[03:15.36]There's no laws up there.
[03:16.34]When you get to 5,000 feet in the air, there's no laws anymore.
[03:20.60]I'll never forget Bob Anderson.
[03:33.17]What was his name?
[03:34.97]He said that if we were going to make it together, we were going to become close friends.
[03:39.99]He was a scientist.
[03:42.64]He told me his entire life story.
[03:43.96]We said we were going to get to the top of Mount Cheyenne and we were going to scream together at the same time when we got down.
[03:49.52]I'm ready to go home.
[03:56.81]I don't care about any of this.
[04:02.09]I got one important thing to tell you.
[04:03.55]The most important thing is if you're trying to save on travel, it's not worth it.
[04:11.92]It's $37.
[04:12.26]I gotta go home.
[04:15.73]I gotta get out of here.
[04:42.36]And my phone.
[04:44.74]I don't walk.
[04:50.00]Don't do it too fast, not too fast.
[04:58.02]Get off me.
[05:03.96]I haven't had a glass of water in like 10 days.
[05:19.91]Ow.
[05:24.45]Okay.
[05:29.55]That was the stupidest fucking thing ever, man.
[05:36.84]What's today?
[05:41.88]It's been two and a half weeks?
[05:47.06]When?
[05:47.50]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[05:48.20]When did I leave?
[05:50.81]What day, when did I leave?
[05:59.00]I'm so sorry.
[06:00.30]I thought it was gonna be safe and easy.
[06:04.17]I just drank piss for like six days.
[06:12.29]It's like having the flu.
[06:15.54]You know, you're not supposed to drink a whole lot when you have the flu.
[06:17.48]You're supposed to take really small sips.
[06:19.96]Okay.
[06:21.50]Well, give me one second.
[06:24.64]I thought it's been like seven days.
[06:27.90]Jesus.
[06:30.08]Give me one minute.
[06:31.88]One second.
[06:55.74]Okay.
[06:57.14]I get to sit down here.
[06:59.62]Ugh.
[07:02.65]Just, I threw some on just to have it.
[07:05.23]Ugh.
[07:07.09]Gotta shave.
[07:08.59]It's been too long, man.
[07:14.05]Ooh, that's nice.
[07:17.44]How was your, how was your day?
[07:20.64]How was your, how was your weekend?
[07:28.25]Oh, that's a smooth one.
[07:33.02]This is the best way to shave, in my opinion.
[07:35.66]It allows you to... What is this?
[07:39.28]I've been eating with my hands for a long time.
[07:43.10]Let's get this side here.
[07:44.08]There we are.
[07:46.02]Okay.
[07:47.32]Let's get this side real quick.
[07:50.57]How fast do you think I can do it?
[07:52.83]Time me!
[07:56.56]Give me five seconds.
[07:58.53]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, got it.
[08:05.37]That was a peak.
[08:07.03]I don't know what happened there.
[08:11.69]How fast can I do it?
[08:12.69]Anyways, guys, I'm sorry it's been this long.
[08:19.73]This is always, I don't like this part.
[08:21.05]I don't like doing this part.
[08:24.49]Okay, that's nice and clean.
[08:27.52]Do you think I should leave up here for, like, the new arc?
[08:30.84]Right?
[08:33.98]Do you guys shave up here?
[08:34.97]I usually shave up near my eye and down, like, over in the socket area here.
[08:42.01]The chin is the worst.
[08:42.93]Keep this part.
[08:49.39]Okay.
[08:52.74]Maybe I'll do a stash.
[08:56.54]There we are.
[09:00.21]Okay.
[09:01.41]Looking good.
[09:02.85]Who said you couldn't shave with a... I can't get too riled up.
[09:15.33]I can't have any fun.
[09:16.56]I haven't been having any fun for a long time.
[09:19.98]I just had fun and it hurt my whole body.
[09:30.01]You don't know what it was like up there.
[09:32.11]You have no idea what I've been through up there.
[09:39.80]I've had to fight people.
[09:42.00]I fought off three different people that were trying to commandeer my balloon.
[09:49.22]Where'd my shaving utensil go?
[09:59.08]Did I eat the other passengers?
[10:02.58]Of course not!
[10:07.36]What do you think, I'm insane?
[10:08.82]You think there's something wrong with me?
[10:13.46]Nobody said that.
[10:14.64]Nobody said that.
[10:15.20]What do you mean nobody said that?
[10:21.17]That looks good.
[10:23.41]Okay, and let's... No, don't put it in your mouth.
[10:27.39]Ugh.
[10:28.85]pre-recorded.
[10:29.45]No one said, what, that I've been eating people?
[10:32.62]I could never eat somebody.
[10:34.94]Let me be on the record here right now.
[10:37.42]You can get this as recorded as you want.
[10:39.96]Dab or I'm not dabbing.
[10:42.10]I could never eat someone.
[10:44.66]Ever.
[10:45.74]I find it disgusting.
[10:47.08]I find it absolutely abhorrent.
[10:48.60]Like, I would never even attempt it.
[10:50.30]Not one.
[10:51.22]You'd never catch me.
[10:52.30]I wouldn't be the guy doing it.
[10:53.30]I wouldn't be the first guy to raise his hand.
[10:56.49]Not me.
[11:06.17]Boogers.
[11:07.03]Get this side, get that side.
[11:11.09]Give it a wipe.
[11:17.66]Okay, I gotta be careful.
[11:18.68]Let's try that again.
[11:21.64]That's better.
[11:25.24]He's gone insane.
[11:26.24]I'm perfectly healthy.
[11:29.28]I got plenty of nutrients from all the things that I've consumed.
[11:38.72]Literally houses looks good.
[11:40.52]I'm glad it does But from my understanding there's been some pretty major Infrastructural internet problems at this place to a point where it was impossible Impossible to turn on a live stream from what I've been told That's great Don't have Comcast by the way
[12:04.64]Cox now, it's just an abbreviated form of Comcast.
[12:07.88]It could be the same company for all I know It's Cox we have Cox The internet look guys Etalyx and I have have Cox.
[12:25.02]Alright, that's just what we have Feel XCO X
[12:34.79]So, the stream may or may not just turn off.
[12:40.41]I hope it doesn't, but you know.
[12:44.34]My whole, my back hurts.
[12:46.86]Oh, I need to like get out of these clothes.
[12:48.24]Nice, fresh, dirty white towel.
[12:53.22]There it is.
[12:55.36]Okay, do I have any more shaving cream on me or are we good?
[13:00.47]You have shaving cream on the side of your head.
[13:03.23]Where?
[13:05.29]Oh, you're right, I do.
[13:08.25]No, this does not belong in your hair, although I probably could use it.
[13:14.29]What happened to the people?
[13:15.21]Look, I'm just gonna go ahead and say, I do not want to relive any of the things that happened over the last two weeks.
[13:24.08]I'm burying it.
[13:25.46]I've got a surveying team digging away in the center of my brain, and that's where it's gonna go forever.
[13:32.11]You're never going to see it again.
[13:33.43]I'm never going to hear about it.
[13:34.49]It's going to be just gone forever.
[13:36.51]So you'll never hear a story.
[13:38.13]You're not going to hear anything about what happened on those ships.
[13:41.83]Because that's what they are.
[13:42.57]They're just ships shaped like fucking balloons.
[13:45.22]They're changing the lore.
[13:59.15]But
[14:02.61]I didn't eat anybody.
[14:04.62]But I got to get out of these clothes.
[14:07.32]Well, I figured I would just sit here for a little bit.
[14:10.70]Just so you know that I've made it to Vegas.
[14:12.70]Made it to Las Vegas.
[14:13.90]Somebody said audio delay.
[14:19.41]Hold on a second.
[14:20.69]I had these specially delivered to make me feel better.
[14:23.67]I have Pac-Man coasters for crying out loud.
[14:27.51]Show auto.
[14:30.06]He's like sleeping.
[14:31.12]They've been here for the whole time.
[14:32.68]Everyone's been waiting for me.
[14:36.08]No audio display.
[14:37.30]What?
[14:37.52]What are you talking about?
[14:45.82]Upgraded.
[14:46.20]Yeah.
[14:47.84]I got upgraded earphones for... This is the kind of incredibly sane person that I am.
[14:55.38]Take a look at this, man.
[14:57.94]Take a look at this.
[15:02.15]That's right.
[15:03.97]Orange chair, orange headphones.
[15:07.81]I went wild with the fucking design of this place in the 15 seconds I've been in here.
[15:14.37]You've gained a little bit of weight.
[15:18.20]Ow.
[15:19.40]I gotta be careful.
[15:23.78]Home Depot?
[15:24.94]This is not from the Home Depot.
[15:27.10]Is there a new booster seat on there?
[15:30.65]No.
[15:34.29]Crazy streamer chooses orange.
[15:36.09]What's wrong with orange?
[15:37.37]It brings out my eyes.
[15:39.33]It brings out my, like, my, like, red fucking skin.
[15:43.83]My, like, permanently, like, red skin.
[15:49.77]You know, people give me shit like that.
[15:50.95]They're like, why is your face so red?
[15:53.37]I don't know.
[15:53.81]I'm full of blood.
[15:56.23]I got more blood than anybody you probably know.
[15:58.46]That's why.
[16:00.42]That just proves that there's so much going up into my brain.
[16:12.59]You guys, because of eating.
[16:15.88]What is that, what do you mean because of eating?
[16:18.48]Human blood.
[16:20.30]Ooh.
[16:22.20]High blood content.
[16:23.86]Is it still in my nose?
[16:26.66]But yeah, let me give you the long and short of it.
[16:30.76]The real long and short of it.
[16:32.00]Let me see here.
[16:32.78]We've got a lot of people subbing here.
[16:34.66]I don't have anything like ready to go stream-wise.
[16:40.36]And that's because it just got off of a goddamn balloon.
[16:42.82]That was fucking painful.
[16:45.48]And we're having lots of internet problems.
[16:50.12]So we're here now.
[16:51.92]Let's see.
[16:52.24]What can I like?
[16:52.88]We're still on.
[16:57.65]We can just hang on and read bits.
[16:59.33]Sure, why not?
[17:03.77]Thank you, everybody, for the extreme amount of support here.
[17:06.19]Just coming back for the first time in a long time.
[17:09.39]I appreciate it.
[17:11.39]Play Bloons Tower Defense?
[17:18.09]No, not right now.
[17:21.40]From my understanding, from what I've been told, this is the first two hours that the internet has been able to be live for more than 30 minutes straight.
[17:37.06]So that's from my understanding.
[17:38.22]So this is essentially
[17:41.96]We got, it's here.
[17:43.32]Internet's here.
[17:48.06]How?
[17:50.36]Alex was telling me this shit.
[17:51.90]He was like relaying it to me.
[17:54.22]As I was walking up the stairs and he was like, hey, dude, the internet.
[17:57.77]I'm like, I don't care.
[17:58.63]I gotta go to the bathroom.
[17:59.77]And I went to the bathroom.
[18:03.81]Let's not even talk about how fucked up that process was.
[18:10.55]Big bits coming in.
[18:13.00]Yeah, we actually have huge bits coming.

[19:30.09]I'm already fucked up from that travel.
[19:33.79]Fenway Chaos just gave $100.
[19:35.41]It gives a YouTube link.
[19:40.87]It's an it's an instant long.
[19:42.43]It was an instant.
[19:43.16]No, that's a fat.
[19:44.04]What what was that?
[19:46.70]Wait a minute.

[20:11.29]That was a pretty good one.
[20:13.07]I probably should change this off of travel and outdoors.
[20:15.49]We ain't outside anymore.
[20:18.12]Let's put it to just chatting.
[20:21.94]First stream back.
[20:23.52]And oh, baby.
[20:26.80]Oh, I just realized if the internet works like it should, we got... Red Dead Redemption 2 comes out tomorrow.
[20:40.72]Right.
[20:42.40]It does.
[20:48.13]Doesn't seem so bad being in that balloon for like three weeks.
[20:53.11]I will be playing Red Dead Redemption 2 tomorrow.
[20:55.97]If the internet works.
[20:59.89]Lethal League came out.
[21:01.89]Oh my god.
[21:02.62]So many things.
[21:03.50]This is what happens when you travel for this long.
[21:07.76]L.A.
[21:07.98]Noire.
[21:08.32]I still have to continue and finish that.
[21:09.68]That's right.
[21:11.69]Where's the Labo?
[21:12.59]I did the Labo a while ago.
[21:14.21]I did the Labo like two, three months ago.
[21:18.89]We did them all.
[21:19.39]We did every Labo that was possible.
[21:22.73]Oblivion, I've just been so detached.
[21:26.78]I've been eating, I've been floating around for like three weeks.
[21:33.20]God, I feel good though.
[21:34.92]I feel like I could like bench at least 70 pounds.
[21:43.36]But yeah, I'm realizing this right now.
[21:49.08]We have Red Dead.
[21:50.18]We've got Oblivion.
[21:52.98]We've got Lethal League.
[21:54.65]There's a lot to do.
[21:56.29]I really sincerely hope that this is not just a fluke.
[22:00.25]And the major issue that was affecting...
[22:05.75]And it was a major issue.
[22:06.84]This is not just like, does the internet work?
[22:10.40]There was a major infrastructural problem.
[22:13.62]So they ended up fixing it.
[22:16.42]Let's hope that it's done.
[22:18.44]Because if not, that's going to be real sad.
[22:21.64]But Jackbox Party... I haven't spoken out loud in a long time.
[22:29.79]Jackbox Party Pack.
[22:32.69]Jackbox Party Box?

[23:53.85]And congrats to all the people that got the sub.
[23:57.24]Yeah, it's so funny because I was thinking about this while I was in the balloon floating around.
[24:04.36]I was thinking about this in my brain.
[24:06.14]I was going, man, there was a bunch of people gifting subs in September, and then they could run out, right, and they could come back.
[24:13.98]Is that still going on?
[24:15.96]Is it like September still?
[24:18.30]I don't even know.
[24:20.70]Can somebody fill me in?
[24:23.98]It's like Subtober.
[24:24.96]I haven't looked at anything.
[24:26.88]It's October.
[24:27.62]I know, but does those carry over?
[24:30.04]I have no idea.
[24:32.84]September is over.
[24:35.64]It's October, so no.
[24:36.82]I don't know, man.
[24:43.19]I've been all fucked up.
[24:47.25]But no, Tankless Crown, that's a lot of gifted subs.
[24:50.11]That's a ton, man.
[24:53.22]Glad you're back.
[24:53.94]I'm glad to be back.
[24:56.08]I was getting antsy up there.
[24:57.53]I so badly wanted to stream.
[25:04.81]If you were gifted in September, it renewed in September.
[25:07.57]Oh, okay.
[25:08.05]I see.
[25:10.57]There's a lot of people here, too.
[25:12.21]I'm glad to be back.
[25:16.71]This is where it starts.
[25:20.27]Moving to Vegas, flying to Vegas is the beginning of a very, very, very good thing.
[25:30.56]You'll see real soon.
[25:33.40]Play Roblox.
[25:34.08]I don't like this thing that I'm on, though.
[25:35.28]I'm just going to throw it away.
[25:36.72]I'm not going to throw it away.
[25:42.15]My hair is a nerd.
[25:42.81]I've got nerdy hair.
[25:47.72]Thank you, Casey, for the $7 here.
[25:49.57]Welcome back.
[25:50.05]Last stream, I gave you $10, but you fucked up and unplugged your router.
[25:53.43]Thank you for the $17 total before I left.
[25:59.99]Handsome hair.
[26:01.65]Well, I just shaved on stream.
[26:05.75]A very good thing, meaning internet problems, too.
[26:07.83]No.
[26:09.36]That's not cool.
[26:11.00]That was completely and totally out of our control, though.
[26:13.88]Completely.
[26:16.04]Like I told you, when I landed and I ran up the stairs and I was told, hey, dude, like, all these internet problems, they're doing a bunch of replacements and there's a bunch of fucked up shit.
[26:21.16]And I'm like, ah, yeah, whatever.
[26:22.41]Like, tell me later.
[26:24.79]I could take a lot of information, so.
[26:29.49]This is a guy who beat his facial hair on stream.
[26:42.88]That just threw me off.
[26:43.84]I just deleted my brain for a second.
[26:45.48]That just threw me off so bad.
[26:48.17]But tons of subs are coming in, tons of bits.
[26:52.23]You guys rock.
[26:55.06]Beat Cox on stream.
[27:34.07]Motherfucker.
[27:35.59]I forgot what it was like to live stream.
[27:38.65]I forgot live streaming was... I have to remember.
[27:41.94]I can't just read that.
[27:49.08]I've been eating birds.
[27:52.02]You guys know when you watch the Discovery Channel and that guy that reaches into the stream and he grabs the fish?
[27:58.53]I've had to do that with birds going by.
[28:01.19]They go by too fast.
[28:02.27]It's faster than you would ever imagine.
[28:03.93]They zoom by like a thousand miles per hour and you have to like grab and fucking bite them.
[28:09.01]And then you have to like cook them in the, in the, look I'm sweating already.
[28:13.55]You have to hold them over like the fire and cook them.
[28:19.86]That's what I've had to do Discovery Channel style and it doesn't work as well as you think it would.
[28:24.54]I've only got two.
[28:35.02]You thought I was vegan?
[28:38.56]Why would you think something like that?
[28:41.77]But it is great to be back.
[28:44.33]No, I survived too.
[28:45.47]There were multiple balloons too, by the way.
[28:48.29]You don't know.
[28:48.83]Some of them, you know, they land, they run out of gas, you get boarded.
[28:54.69]People looking for gold up there.
[28:57.83]It's 5,000 years in the past up there.
[29:01.30]It's like fucking pirates and bandits.
[29:05.94]They haven't gone forward in time up there.
[29:13.22]Where's the gold?
[29:13.96]I don't have any fucking gold, man.
[29:15.54]What are you talking about?
[29:16.96]I'm just trying to travel to Vegas.
[29:20.05]They're trying to get me to walk the plank.
[29:21.75]They put a plank out.
[29:23.47]They got a sword on my back and it's like I had to spin around and do like a spinning twist kick and knock the sword out and kick the guy over.
[29:34.75]Couldn't even make this up if I wanted to.
[29:40.26]Hey.
[29:42.62]Let's check a couple more bits here.
[29:44.02]Sdogaman.
[29:45.32]Sdogaman, thanks for the 20 bucks.
[29:47.92]A toast to my darling streamer and favorite person ever.
[29:50.42]Welcome home.
[29:53.24]That's true.
[29:54.10]This is now home.
[29:57.49]It sounds very stressful.
[29:58.35]It was.
[30:00.55]Some of it was great.
[30:06.72]I can't even.
[30:09.17]I told you I wanted to bury it.
[30:16.50]Bob Anderson.
[30:18.82]I'll never forget him.
[30:23.18]I called him Bob Steel Anderson because, man, could he handle everything under pressure.
[30:31.47]When I thought the worst was going to happen, when I was at my lowest, Bob, Bob Anderson was there to tell me, to coach me through it.
[30:41.64]He was a great, great man, and I'll never forget him.
[30:49.69]He's the one that taught me how to, like, do this.
[30:53.17]Like, in the...
[31:04.34]Sorry.
[31:12.74]Mod Bob Anderson.
[31:15.42]I would.
[31:16.66]I would.
[31:21.43]Hey, Jerma, this is the new tenant.
[31:22.61]You forgot your car keys here.
[31:23.97]Can you balloon back?
[31:29.94]It's the new tenant.
[31:31.12]Can you balloon back?
[31:32.86]I ain't doing that again.
[31:33.98]Oh, he's here.
[31:37.60]Oh, you mean somebody just made a Twitch account with his name?
[31:42.46]You think you're so funny?
[31:44.06]Ow.
[31:50.32]Bob, that's not even him.
[31:52.12]He didn't even know what the internet was.
[31:55.24]I told him what I did.
[31:57.96]Like I'm a tuber and he was like, oh, I don't know what that is I'm like what how do you how would you not know that?
[32:05.99]He's like, I don't know.
[32:06.53]I don't really use the internet.
[32:07.73]I'm not like an internet guy.
[32:08.87]Like damn man, really?
[32:14.97]He thought I was mailing people shit You know, he's like, oh me like you're like a mailman.
[32:21.09]I'm like, no, no, no, no
[32:26.75]But it's alright.
[32:27.29]He was a great, he was an awesome dude.
[32:32.71]It's hard to describe.
[32:33.71]When you're a tuber, you know, it's hard to describe what you do to people.
[32:36.12]It's difficult to describe what you do.
[32:45.44]So much emotion coming from such a small streamer.
[32:47.76]Glad you settled at the new place, small guy.
[32:49.96]Why do you have to...
[32:52.26]Thank you, but do you have to write the word small like four times?
[33:06.15]He's standing up.
[33:07.13]I'm in my new orange chair, and it's great.
[33:11.35]And it all specially delivered.
[33:13.31]I thought I was going to be here a long time ago.
[33:18.17]Creepy noise.
[33:23.71]I don't hear anything.
[33:29.25]Yeah, it's car noises, probably, you're hearing.
[33:31.77]Somebody probably pulled down here.
[33:34.67]There's a leak in this.
[33:36.47]Did not even get me on there.
[33:42.25]Home Depot delivers pretty fast.
[33:46.17]I mean, yeah, but it's not Home Depot.
[33:48.41]I don't know why you keep saying that.
[33:54.32]Joke, incoming, beep, beep, beep.
[33:56.30]No, I don't have it.
[33:57.24]I just need to settle.
[33:58.80]I want to make sure I went live and make sure you guys knew that I was alive and still here.
[34:09.05]What time does Red Dead come out?
[34:16.14]More wasps.
[34:18.66]Does it actually come out today?
[34:25.48]Oh, midnight.
[34:26.02]Hold on.
[34:26.36]Midnight Eastern.
[34:31.95]So that would be... Was it midnight Pacific?
[34:34.13]Because it used to be I used to have to wake up at 9 p.m.
[34:38.13]Pacific?
[34:40.03]What?
[34:40.63]A 100 gig download?
[34:44.90]Oh, well, never mind.
[34:45.58]We ain't doing that tonight.
[34:50.04]100 gigs.
[34:52.22]That's an entire hard drive 10 years ago.
[34:56.08]They used to advertise that on the back of the box.
[35:07.03]Scorpions instead of wasps.
[35:09.01]Lethal League Blaze.
[35:09.97]Yeah, I actually had a message here.
[35:14.83]I had a message here.
[35:16.21]Two or three of them on my new phone that I got.
[35:20.35]Not an iPhone X. I don't know where that one went.
[35:28.67]This is just a regular phone.
[35:32.14]And it's... I had a few text messages on my carrier here.
[35:41.22]Star was talking about playing it.
[35:43.89]Lethal League Blaze.
[35:45.71]You'll see that real soon too.
[35:50.65]1080p streams now?
[35:53.41]Yeah, when it works.
[35:54.92]When it works.
[35:59.40]The internet here, when it is supposed to work, is... is crazy.
[36:06.05]This is a gigabit line.
[36:07.47]So... When it works... It works.
[36:16.06]I prefer the lower quality.
[36:17.40]Let me turn it down real quick just to get, like, shit quality.
[36:23.82]It just works.
[36:25.54]Yeah, this is...
[36:29.25]I'm at like 6,000 up, 6,000 kilobits, right?
[36:35.45]I was streaming back at my old house at 3,500 or like 4,000 maybe, just because it couldn't handle it.
[36:43.98]You guys know the story there.
[36:47.02]Yeah, the bit rate is higher.
[36:49.50]And depending on if this internet can continue to stay stable the next 24 hours, then you just notice the stream image thing.
[37:00.58]What?
[37:02.68]Stream image thing.
[37:04.04]What's that?
[37:06.45]Do I like the sun?
[37:07.19]Oh, it's amazing.
[37:09.93]I love it out here.
[37:12.27]Love it, love it, love it.
[37:14.17]I mean, I floated over it.
[37:18.21]It was pretty nice.
[37:20.68]Been here for about 40 minutes.
[37:24.14]I looked down.
[37:24.74]We actually went over the strip and I was looking down and it looked like people were having a ton of fun.
[37:30.61]I was like, oh, wow.
[37:31.67]Look, that person's like laughing.
[37:35.24]It looked like they were having a good time.
[37:40.94]I look so different.
[37:45.88]Why?
[37:47.03]Because I actually have like a light coming into my room.
[37:50.31]Let me see.
[37:50.71]Let me tell you guys what you've been used to.
[37:52.15]Hold on.
[37:53.09]Ready?
[37:53.27]Ready?
[37:54.92]You're used to, like, this.
[37:56.97]Like, a light beam.
[37:58.53]Hold on.
[37:59.67]Let's go back to old Jerma.
[38:01.11]That sounds good to me.
[38:01.93]This is what you guys are used to.
[38:07.65]No, like... I feel like a doctor.
[38:16.37]Like, look at you.
[38:19.37]That didn't work.
[38:21.07]I was trying to get, like, lights to come from, like, up here.
[38:25.29]Yeah, you want to see my, like, never mind.
[38:31.94]I'm just like, it's a, I'm lit fully.
[38:35.60]You know, like, I've got a nice window.
[38:37.80]I've got some nice lighting here that's not even turned on.
[38:40.60]It's just natural.
[38:42.50]It's just natural lit.
[38:45.14]Not in the fun way that people like to say, in the actually, you know, light kind of way.
[38:54.75]Really?
[38:55.07]Is this really what you guys are doing right now?
[39:00.42]Your left side is lit more than your right.
[39:02.96]Yeah, but hold on.
[39:04.00]Wait, wait, wait.
[39:06.60]Look, I haven't got anything set up yet.
[39:09.84]But I'm raring to go.
[39:15.75]I am ready to go, guys.
[39:20.57]Let's go here.
[39:21.51]Alright, here we go.
[39:23.77]Okay, that made it a little bit better.
[39:29.11]So now I should be lit from the front.
[39:32.37]See, that's natural too.
[39:33.35]That's a natural light.
[39:35.93]Although I don't like it.
[39:39.59]No, no, no, no.
[39:40.19]I don't like that.
[39:42.18]I don't like being too well lit.
[39:43.80]Because then you can like see me and shit.
[39:45.22]You can like be like, oh wow, look, he looks like shit today.
[39:47.50]Like no, you can't even tell how bad I look right now.
[39:51.14]You can't, you're just like looking at me so you can.
[39:56.63]This is fine.
[40:00.55]We got big bits from Major Clusterfuck.
[40:05.42]$50 from Major Clusterfuck.
[40:07.28]Do you remember my internet crashed during your stream?
[40:09.10]Thanks, dummy.
[40:11.70]I didn't do it.
[40:14.42]I didn't do anything.
[40:15.94]I just turned on the stream.
[40:21.45]You are a fine fellow.
[40:22.95]Hey, thank you.
[40:24.47]That was a really nice thing to say.
[40:29.03]and my sideburns a different length.
[40:37.63]I just shit, you just watch to be doing okay.
[40:46.14]It's been a rough couple of weeks.
[40:49.14]I took, I just did it on stream and I'm losing this as a mirror.
[40:53.64]What do you want me to do?
[40:54.48]I was using this as a mirror.
[41:15.87]We're going to hang out like this for a little while.
[41:21.61]I don't want anybody coming in here and doing my issue.
[41:29.30]But thank you, eHalfnote, for the 10 bucks.
[41:31.20]I seriously missed your face.
[41:32.18]Good to see you.
[41:32.64]Hope you're moving.
[41:33.66]Kinks get worked out soon.
[41:36.66]Me too.
[41:36.98]2019, man.
[41:37.14]End of 2018, end of 2019.
[41:44.69]I'm ready.
[41:45.01]We're going to have a lot of fucking fun.
[41:48.44]A lot of fun.
[41:49.86]I can promise you that.
[41:52.20]Going to play Red Dead tonight.
[41:53.14]I'm going to play Red Dead tomorrow.
[41:55.14]Hopefully this thing stays working because I want to stream Red Dead tomorrow.
[42:03.06]This stream was just like, hey, I landed it.
[42:06.22]Here I am.
[42:11.11]I didn't really have necessarily a plan tonight.
[42:12.99]Besides landing and taking a shower.
[42:16.84]Stream is done.
[42:17.57]You dare say stream is done.
[42:18.91]That's a joke here.
[42:21.44]It's a nice looking rat tail.
[42:24.00]It's not.
[42:24.76]This is not a rat.
[42:25.79]This is why.
[42:27.03]Why does Jerma not want to put a camera on?
[42:29.49]Why does Jerma not want a camera on?
[42:31.09]He's like, he doesn't look terrible or anything.
[42:34.03]It's just the one guy in chat that decides to point out the fact that one of my sideburns is a little longer and to make fun of my rat tail.
[42:41.70]But it's not.
[42:42.38]This hair is here.
[42:43.80]See?
[42:44.36]It's part of the back.
[42:45.22]A rat tail would be if I had a...
[42:48.60]Big piece down the middle, which I do not.
[42:51.24]Let's see.
[42:52.32]See?
[42:53.36]I do not.
[43:03.51]Rat tail.
[43:05.55]Yes, I do.
[43:06.29]Show me.
[43:06.89]Show it to me.
[43:07.49]I want to see it.
[43:10.21]Let me see.
[43:10.69]Show it to me.
[43:11.51]Clip it.
[43:11.87]Let's see.
[43:12.25]I want to see.
[43:12.75]I don't believe you.
[43:16.51]What's the new schedule going to be like?
[43:18.78]Give me another couple days because we'll really get the ball rolling once it's certain that I can stream from here reliably.
[43:30.01]But I'm going to be starting hopefully around like one to three in that zone there, Pacific.
[43:44.41]Maybe even earlier.
[43:45.41]I don't know.
[43:45.73]I just have to see how it goes.
[43:49.65]I'm not clicking a clip until I know it's the right one.
[43:53.01]Okay, let's see.
[43:56.07]I'm going to put... Let's go right here.
[43:59.23]Okay.
[44:00.77]Desktop audio is currently on.
[44:05.19]Why can I not hear this?
[44:08.14]Why can I not... Okay.

[44:48.50]Much appreciated.
[44:49.14]Thank you so much.
[44:50.66]My mic is quiet.
[44:51.54]These are all things that I'm going to figure out.
[44:52.94]I didn't really have very much time.
[44:54.26]I just walked in here.
[44:55.46]I just walked to the house.
[45:00.05]Rat tail.
[45:00.65]Let's see.
[45:01.67]Here.
[45:02.31]See?
[45:02.53]Okay.
[45:03.41]This is it.
[45:04.51]Let's get this thing on the screen here.
[45:06.55]Can I even do that?
[45:07.83]I don't even know.
[45:08.69]I just installed OBS.
[45:11.43]I don't even know if I can do this.
[45:14.59]Hold on.
[45:18.28]Can I?
[45:18.62]I can, okay.
[45:21.38]Let's see.
[45:22.02]Thank you.
[45:22.32]It was like, I mean, if anything, that looked like a shitty broom and not a rat tail.
[45:24.52]If anything, that looked like a... Yes, I do.
[45:26.68]Show me.
[45:27.34]Show me.
[45:53.05]Why is this still going?
[45:55.11]This clip is not even up.
[45:56.63]Which I do not.
[45:57.65]Let's see.
[45:58.33]Where is this coming from?
[45:59.79]I do not.
[46:00.85]I don't.
[46:02.46]There's nothing up on my screen right now.
[46:05.02]No clips, no nothing.
[46:07.62]Why is this continuing to play?
[46:11.00]Why is this playing?
[46:12.70]Show me.
[46:13.30]Show it to me.
[46:13.93]I want to see it.
[46:16.65]Let me see.
[46:17.11]Show it to me.
[46:17.77]Here.
[46:18.43]See?
[46:18.99]It's part of the back.
[46:19.77]The
[46:21.15]There's no windows open on my whole computer.
[46:25.30]Do you want me to prove this to you guys?
[46:32.31]Because this just seems like I'm a liar.
[46:35.73]I need to prove this to you guys.
[46:37.59]Because this doesn't make any sense.
[46:39.79]It won't stop.
[46:40.93]Here.
[46:41.49]Look at it.
[46:42.11]I can't even do this.
[46:44.67]Look.
[46:44.85]This is a monitor.
[46:45.83]There's nothing else on this monitor.
[46:48.67]This is my Twitch.
[46:50.05]Look, that's how many people are watching, right?
[46:53.90]Here's my other dashboard.
[46:55.74]There's nothing else here.
[46:56.56]Here's the chat on this screen.
[46:57.30]Look.
[46:57.52]Look.
[47:08.36]Yes, I do.
[47:09.06]Show me.
[47:09.66]Show it to me.
[47:10.62]I don't have anything else open.
[47:13.01]Let me see.
[47:13.47]Show it to me.
[47:14.11]Here.
[47:14.81]See?
[47:15.35]It's part of the back.
[47:16.77]I don't have anything.
[47:17.89]Oh, did you just... Big piece down the middle, which I do not.
[47:22.67]See?
[47:27.61]It's just playing somewhere.
[47:31.06]It's in OBS?
[47:32.06]No, it's not.
[47:36.57]Yes, I do.
[47:37.27]Show me.
[47:37.87]Show it to me.
[47:38.49]I want to see it.
[47:39.06]I got it.
[47:42.54]Task manager.
[48:21.65]I seriously, like, I don't know why.
[48:23.29]I didn't even have it up.
[48:27.18]He doesn't understand the minus windows.
[48:29.08]You saw it.
[48:29.60]You saw, like, the dashboard by windows open.
[48:32.26]There was nothing else on the screen.
[48:39.18]Show it to me.
[48:40.16]No, show it to me.
[48:45.15]We didn't see your taskbar?
[48:46.39]I don't want you to open- I don't want to open up my taskbar!
[48:48.55]I don't know, what if there's something on there that I don't want you to see, like... Tax returns!
[48:57.28]Afternoon, all Jermamites.
[48:58.66]What are you doing?
[49:01.10]Attention to all Jermamites.
[49:03.52]Jerm is in great danger and needs your help to wipe out the hornets.
[49:06.32]What the fuck are you talking about?
[49:12.86]Release my tax returns?
[49:15.36]No.
[49:16.56]I'm not running for office.
[49:18.64]You don't need to see my tax returns.
[49:22.99]We lost the light, though.
[49:28.61]Danger.
[49:30.79]He needs you to get better internet.
[49:32.95]Is this like a new thing?
[49:34.13]Is this like a thing that I missed since I was floating around for so long?
[49:39.21]What's this new funny Twitch thing that I don't know what it is?
[49:45.02]I can't keep up.
[49:46.02]Once a week, there's a new copypasta, okay?
[49:49.98]I don't know.
[49:50.28]I can't keep up with them.
[49:51.11]How am I supposed to keep up with all these?
[49:57.37]What do we got?
[49:57.95]We're at about an hour, and we're still solid green here.
[50:00.87]This is good.
[50:01.33]Man, the lights are all fucked up now.
[50:07.45]Where are we here?
[50:08.17]Okay.
[50:08.49]Let me see.
[50:09.25]Alright.
[50:15.15]Why do I look green?
[50:20.80]I shouldn't look green.
[50:22.10]There we go.
[50:22.46]That's better.
[50:24.00]Did I, like, wipe goo on here?
[50:25.84]Okay, there we go.
[50:36.02]Don't touch.
[50:36.66]I'm just wiping you guys down to make sure that you're clean.
[50:46.26]Oh, it's just a coffee pasta that appeared out of nowhere.
[50:50.76]Okay.
[50:52.60]What's the best flavor of Popsicle?
[50:54.58]Well, in that panic, I lost something here.
[50:56.42]We got more bits.
[50:57.12]And I don't have Streamlabs set up on the screen yet.
[51:00.58]We'll hopefully be doing this all tomorrow.
[51:04.97]Ele Noir, thank you for the $50.
[51:06.11]Just wanted to give you a moving gift.
[51:08.03]And can you please tell my good friend Razor, happy birthday.
[51:12.07]Happy birthday, Razor.
[51:14.94]Happy birthday, Razor, from Eleanor.
[51:17.64]Eleanor, thank you for the $50.
[51:19.17]My favorite popsicle is... Can you see my entire setup in my eyes?
[51:34.35]Hold on a second.
[51:49.72]What is over here?
[51:50.32]What is this there?
[51:51.66]No, it's this.
[51:53.40]Can you see my hand?
[51:56.26]You can.
[51:57.00]Okay, hold on.
[51:59.74]So, hold on.
[52:00.58]You can see the hand right there.
[52:09.09]Okay, how many fingers am I holding up?
[52:12.03]Can you tell?
[52:19.08]Two?
[52:19.30]Okay, what about now?
[52:24.75]Four.
[52:25.11]Fuck, you guys can see all that.
[52:27.83]I'm going to get closer and there's going to be a gnome in there.
[52:29.65]I know it.
[52:31.07]I didn't even do it.
[52:48.09]That does look weird.
[52:49.79]This looks too good.
[52:53.15]I agree.
[52:54.71]I'm turning the stream quality down like 40%.
[53:03.04]Doesn't it look like... It looks like I'm in a movie.
[53:10.43]Did you see this?
[53:12.81]Got the moon here.
[53:23.74]My Moonlight had that pre-installed.
[53:30.74]Turn off RTX.
[53:36.96]I stole the moon when I was up there.
[53:38.44]I grabbed it and I like... I'm just glad they were able to get that live feed, that live landing feed.
[53:49.10]Good thing they could pump that through here.
[53:53.94]Despicable Me?
[53:57.48]Wait, does that happen in Despicable Me?
[54:02.54]Does it really?
[54:04.65]No, it doesn't, does it?
[54:11.21]Alright, what's more popular?
[54:12.13]What do you guys think?
[54:13.09]You ready?
[54:13.73]This is gonna be hard.
[54:15.45]What's more popular?
[54:18.13]Despicable Me Minions or Fortnite?
[54:24.92]which one of those is more popular you I mean yeah you're saying Fortnite but Fortnite doesn't have like four rides at universal studios what if they do eventually there's gonna be like rides about Fortnite it's already Halloween costumes about Fortnite and I'm just like excuse me Fortnite Halloween costumes are on I remember
[54:51.53]There's Overwatch costumes.
[54:53.11]There's, like, Mercy and Reaper, Fortnite.
[54:56.88]That shit didn't exist when I was younger.
[55:00.54]I would love it if there was a wall of, like, Diablo II costumes.
[55:03.32]Like, what the heck?
[55:06.43]I didn't have that.
[55:08.15]We had, like, priest, nurse, dentist, doctor, and, like, army guy.
[55:15.97]That's what I got to pick from for Halloween costumes.
[55:18.82]I would have loved to have been Reaper.
[55:22.79]When I was like 14, 15.
[55:23.47]Boomer.
[55:24.13]He can call me whatever you want.
[55:33.18]All I'm telling you is I didn't have a choice of those kind of costumes.
[55:36.16]There are so many interesting costumes.
[55:42.40]I was a rubbish bag to a Halloween party.
[55:50.38]dress up and no hold on I gotta get my cream out of here my like shaving cream towel but what was I dressed as every year I was a power ranger one time homemade costume forgot it I told you guys that story already I was the red ranger
[56:14.36]Left my costume at home and, you know, they like funnel all the kids from class to class and show off your costume.
[56:22.53]That was always a little awkward, wasn't it?
[56:24.81]Okay, everybody, we're gonna go to another classroom as another full classroom and walk around that classroom.
[56:32.72]It was weird.
[56:34.08]They single file lined you up and you walked around everybody's desk.
[56:39.64]Hey, I'm a Power Ranger.
[56:43.83]Hey, are you like a princess?
[56:46.93]Okay, cool.
[56:48.69]Army guy, alright.
[56:49.57]I'm a Power Ranger.
[56:50.91]I'm going to go around the whole thing.
[56:53.07]Okay, we're going to go to the next door and do the same thing.
[56:58.38]Did we go to the same school?
[56:59.76]No, this is just what every school does, Dad.
[57:06.72]Oh, you're an Army guy?
[57:09.96]Why does young Jerma have a low voice?
[57:13.76]Oh, that's just like the disinterested person voice.
[57:17.55]You know, whatever.
[57:19.17]It could be somebody that doesn't care that there's a worker, that, no, not my job, whatever.
[57:23.95]Could be somebody that doesn't necessarily care about what you're saying to them, just disinterested.
[57:28.31]Oh, hey, was that the Red Sox game last night?
[57:30.23]Yeah, Red Sox, cool, okay.
[57:32.35]Yeah, apparently they're doing real good.
[57:34.48]They're a World Series.
[57:35.62]That's funny.
[57:40.61]Garfield.
[57:45.19]Can you say I hate Mondays?
[57:48.01]I don't, though.
[57:50.93]If anything, I hate Sundays.
[57:53.22]Garfield had it all wrong.
[57:55.28]Let me tell you guys.
[57:56.76]He had it all fucking wrong.
[57:58.26]Sundays suck.
[57:59.90]What happens on Sunday?
[58:01.34]Everything closes.
[58:03.00]Oh, yeah, you can't do this.
[58:04.48]You can't go there.
[58:05.28]Oh, sorry, the mail doesn't fucking deliver on Sunday.
[58:07.96]Sunday sucks.
[58:10.71]What's wrong with Monday?
[58:13.11]Monday's just another day.
[58:15.53]Sunday, like, Target closes at 6 o'clock.
[58:20.36]WTF, you know what I mean?
[58:21.32]Like, WTF?
[58:23.68]What the heck?
[58:26.48]It's the Lord's Day?
[58:29.80]So wait, the Lord's Day can't be every other day?
[58:33.13]Why do we get one day that's the Lord's Day?
[58:38.61]What, so on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday you're allowed to do whatever the fuck you want?
[58:46.10]Every day is the Lord's day.
[58:56.38]No, he's doing a bit.
[58:59.10]And he taught me how to do this.
[59:02.24]He was a great man.
[59:08.72]It's the bit voice.
[59:13.96]What's up, sinners?
[59:20.95]Can I see bits that I missed from, like, previously?
[59:24.05]No.
[59:25.35]Those are all gone.
[59:27.67]Because I'm on a new house.
[59:30.55]New IP, new, like, I did a reinstall of Windows.
[59:34.98]So, I don't have any of that stuff.
[59:37.20]Unfortunately.
[59:38.77]The website!
[59:39.67]Wait, no, that's not even true.
[59:40.95]That website... I keep forgetting that it exists.
[59:45.99]Why did I reinstall Windows?
[59:47.05]Because if you guys remember... Do you guys remember when I was... I kept having Windows update problems where it wouldn't stop?
[59:56.89]Like, it kept trying to update Windows and it would fail every time and it would remind me every hour and I couldn't disable it?
[60:03.63]I couldn't figure out what was going on.
[60:05.84]Nothing worked.
[60:07.50]So...
[60:09.89]I just reinstalled the whole thing and I got the new update and everything's fine.
[60:12.63]So this is like a brand new computer for all intents and purposes.
[60:17.78]Why do I have a button I shaved on stream when I got back out of the balloon?
[60:22.58]You think reinstalling will fix it?
[60:24.14]I mean, it hasn't happened since.
[60:25.53]It was happening like an hour or two.
[60:27.27]Even when I would go into the services and stop the service Windows update.
[60:36.11]Butter knife.
[60:37.35]Shaving with a butter knife.
[60:38.11]Yeah, it worked.
[60:39.35]I do not recommend you try it at home.
[60:40.87]Don't try it at home.
[60:42.41]Don't try this at home.
[60:43.65]You know, make sure I say that like five times.
[60:46.20]Don't try any of the things you've seen on this stream at home.
[60:48.42]Don't try it at home.
[60:49.10]Don't do any of these things at home.
[60:50.78]See?
[60:54.52]I just had to do the thing that they put on the cigarette boxes and I'm legally fine.
[60:57.74]Don't you understand?
[61:01.16]Don't smoke these.
[61:01.84]They're really bad for you.
[61:02.62]The Surgeon General says they're terrible.
[61:04.10]But here, take them.
[61:04.74]They're fine.
[61:06.00]I just have to do the cigarette morning and I'm fine.
[61:13.16]Sure works with the uneven sideburns.
[61:15.18]I don't have any more cream on me.
[61:16.41]How am I supposed to take care of this?
[61:26.53]Watching Jerma while pregnant increases the risk of...
[61:32.48]Tingy gave $10.
[61:34.18]Jörg gave $12.
[61:36.74]My message is too long for Twitch.
[61:38.58]Here's a screenshot.
[61:40.60]We'll look at that in a second.
[61:41.56]Jörg, thanks for the $12.
[61:42.79]I finally saved up enough ad bits to get the $50 badge.
[61:47.35]Thank you for even considering giving me money.
[61:50.89]Thank you guys both.
[61:52.05]And everybody else that's given money randomly here.
[61:54.45]All of you.
[61:56.37]You guys are all amazing.
[61:59.41]Thank you so much.
[62:03.09]Watching Jerma increases the risk of sideburns.
[62:05.25]Only on one side, though.
[62:10.36]Have I looked at the Jerma's Balloon to Vegas hashtag on Reddit and Twitter?
[62:13.22]I haven't been able to.
[62:14.02]I've been up there.
[62:17.36]I've been up there.
[62:18.06]I have not been able to do it.
[62:23.81]Did I miss bits?
[62:24.91]Big bits from Double D?
[62:27.13]How long ago did you do it?
[62:27.77]I think I caught it at the very beginning, didn't I?
[62:31.45]Double D11, yep, $5.50.
[62:32.97]Here's some more love.
[62:35.87]Here's some more.
[62:38.43]Love you, Jeremy.
[62:39.13]I really hope your internet situation gets a lot better soon.
[62:41.46]Game on, gamers.
[62:44.02]Thank you, Double D.
[62:46.79]Thank you so much.
[62:47.95]And again, please bear with these issues.
[62:53.89]I'm sorry that they're happening.
[62:55.79]Etalyx has not been able to stream at all either.
[62:59.18]He's been here for, you know, you guys have seen him here for like a week.
[63:05.20]We're trying at this point.
[63:06.88]I'm here now, right?
[63:07.84]I'm going to get on this and he's been on it.
[63:09.92]So we're going to try.
[63:13.71]We'll get it situated.
[63:21.78]Call New Vegas.
[63:24.22]Alright.
[63:24.78]No, we're in Vegas right now, man.
[63:27.18]We're in Vegas.
[63:28.42]Look at the balloon hashtag.
[63:32.44]On Reddit or Twitter?
[63:33.18]Which one?
[63:35.35]Alright.
[63:37.79]Search.
[63:42.03]Reddit.
[63:44.05]How do you search a hashtag on Reddit?
[63:45.53]I don't even know how to use it.
[63:47.73]Search Reddit.
[63:48.33]Can I just do hashtag Jerma's
[63:51.70]Balloon to Vegas.
[63:56.51]Okay, yeah, okay, we got it here.
[64:06.46]Okay.
[64:06.80]Oh, I see it.
[64:09.20]Hanging out at Two Fort when I looked up and saw this.
[64:11.30]Whoa, what a great view.
[64:16.99]There's this thing here.
[64:17.75]Well, let's go over some of these.
[64:24.02]Uh, I saw Jermis Balloon while doing chemistry.
[64:27.72]I'll show, hold on, I'll get him, I'll get him, I'll get him.
[64:32.36]Let's see here.
[64:36.51]Some of these, I don't know.
[64:39.33]There he is, I see him.
[64:41.25]I told, I've, I tried to scream.
[64:43.67]Every time I saw somebody up like this, like holding a camera, I would just go like this.
[64:48.89]I would lean down and be like.
[64:53.21]I don't think they heard me.
[64:53.85]You know what I mean?
[64:57.07]I would just scream.
[64:59.12]So if you heard somebody screaming, it was definitely me, because there's like 60 to 100, there's like 1,000 other balloons that are up there at any given time.
[65:06.06]Alright, let's look at some of them.
[65:11.36]So this one is, let's get another source on here.
[65:22.44]I can directly go through to this, can't I?
[65:25.88]Let's see.
[65:32.74]Oh, there we go.
[65:35.67]Okay, so... I was hanging out on Twofort when I looked up and saw this.
[65:43.65]Great view.
[65:45.07]Germans ballooned to Vegas.
[65:50.20]Why is it not doing it?
[65:52.52]I think I have to go and interact with it.
[65:56.06]There we go.
[65:56.38]OK.
[65:59.72]I can't even interact with it.
[66:05.36]Why?
[66:05.56]Well, there I am.
[66:07.76]Actually, I do remember doing this, though.
[66:12.72]There we go.
[66:13.06]This is actually a better indicator.
[66:14.28]I can just do it from here.
[66:16.96]Yeah, I, uh, this view sucks.
[66:19.16]Hold on, I'm gonna fix it.
[66:21.48]I don't have all my tools here, you know what I mean?
[66:23.63]Let's just pull in this one.
[66:33.48]How did I get in a video game?
[66:34.98]There are wormholes up there, guys.
[66:38.82]You ever been in a fucking wormhole?
[66:42.50]That's something else.
[66:45.84]There were four different versions of me staring at me when I went through it.
[66:51.00]Okay, this should work now.
[66:56.53]And for some reason it does not.
[66:59.09]Why do you not want to do this to me right now?
[67:04.45]This doesn't want to load it.
[67:06.59]Well, I'm just going to save it to my computer and just put it on the screen.
[67:13.00]I gotta get all this stuff set up.
[67:15.07]But image, there we go.
[67:20.76]There it is.
[67:22.20]So I actually do remember this one.
[67:26.87]Do they look like Interstellar and like Farscape?
[67:29.17]No, don't believe all the bullshit that you see on your television shows.
[67:32.34]It's not even close.
[67:34.10]Not even close.
[67:35.24]It's this big, right?
[67:36.96]It's like a circle like this.
[67:39.36]Just enough for you to look at.
[67:40.62]It's green and it just looks, you know, like the movie Flubber, right?
[67:45.47]You touch it and it goes like and bounces around.
[67:48.59]It looks like that.
[67:49.89]It's just a little thing like this.
[67:52.23]And when you get close enough to it, it just kind of deflates.
[67:56.05]It just goes.
[67:59.46]And then you're in another place.
[68:00.90]All this shit.
[68:01.90]Oh, we're going through a giant toll.
[68:03.44]That doesn't fucking happen.
[68:05.40]A little circle deflates in front of you and you're in a new place.
[68:12.68]I'm describing a wormhole.
[68:14.26]Because I've seen one.
[68:17.56]George Clooney wants to type on his computer and then the giant wormhole opened and sucked in the ship.
[68:23.67]No, that's not real.
[68:25.25]I've seen reality.
[68:26.69]I've seen the inter-reality.
[68:28.13]I've seen the secondary reality and the fourth one.
[68:32.55]Why did I go to two-fourth?
[68:34.06]I didn't.
[68:34.72]This just happened.
[68:37.52]I was looking down...
[68:39.32]I heard a bunch of people swearing over the comms, and I was like, oh, I must be in a video game.
[68:43.88]So I look it down.
[68:44.62]I saw people's name tags on their heads and stuff.
[68:48.28]It was just like a Valve server that I floated through.
[68:53.47]And then another one of those little green blobs, which just deflates, and then the gas, I guess, comes out of it and pulls you through.
[69:02.73]But I do remember this.
[69:03.47]I don't know why it put me here.
[69:05.59]Let's check another one, though.
[69:10.87]All the things you've seen on TV are just total bullshit.
[69:12.61]Let's see if I remember some of these other ones.
[69:17.88]Somebody says this is from Roblox.
[69:19.40]Nah, I was just checking it out.
[69:22.24]There are a lot of video games on here because I went through the video game dimension.
[69:26.24]Remember Wreck-It Ralph?
[69:28.10]Well, I mean, that movie was... I mean, that was a joke, but I Wreck-It Ralphed my way through the video games.
[69:37.47]Minecraft...
[69:39.50]Let's see this one.
[69:42.36]Two Balloons Spotted in Clock Town.
[69:43.88]Yeah, I Wreck-It Ralphed through a few of these games.
[69:49.26]Playing some Forza Horizon 4.
[69:52.01]See, this was interesting because I thought this was real.
[69:54.77]This is not even Forza Horizon 4.
[69:58.95]Wait, is it?
[70:03.71]Hold on a second.
[70:15.48]I mean, I do remember floating around, and I looked down and thought it was cars.
[70:19.48]I thought it was real, though.
[70:23.66]Because from up there, wow, those Xbox 360 graphics.
[70:28.21]Xbox One graphics.
[70:29.47]I was like, this is real, man.
[70:31.25]Whoa, that's a real car down there.
[70:34.57]And I was playing Phil Spencer in my head over and over again.
[70:37.19]He was talking about graphics and graphics and realism and realistic, and I thought it was real.
[70:42.07]I thought this was just a street.
[70:47.02]How long is this bit?
[70:50.36]Not very long.
[70:51.48]I'll do one more.
[70:53.08]How long is this?
[70:54.42]Just chilling at Mother Base.
[70:57.72]This is Metal Gear Solid.
[70:58.90]Uh-huh.
[71:06.79]No, not Metal Gear Solid.
[71:07.79]Yeah, it is Metal Gear Solid.
[71:15.19]It was like Tower Defense, this one.
[71:18.73]Because Mother Base, there's all kinds of military stuff there.
[71:24.96]I made it through, though.
[71:27.66]They were just going one by one.
[71:29.12]Every time I'd fly by, it was just
[71:33.49]And the thing about my balloon is there was two balloons inside of that one balloon.
[71:36.85]So that one pops, but there was another red balloon in there.
[71:40.28]I was fine.
[71:41.24]And then I could hear the guy raging like, what the fuck?
[71:43.70]And it was a lead balloon inside of it.
[71:45.96]So I was able to fly all the way through his base and get rid of all the shit because he didn't have any sniper units.
[71:50.98]So I was fine.
[71:54.54]I was good to go.
[71:59.96]Did I give this guy an autograph?
[72:02.02]I was just throwing them out as we were going by every place I was.
[72:05.56]I figured everyone would want to have it.
[72:08.00]So every state when I was, you know, calculated from the wind and the smell, I would determine where I was.
[72:14.67]And I would just rip off, you know, articles of clothing and, you know, throw them out with signatures on them.
[72:21.73]And I'd scream, you're welcome.
[72:22.71]Well, it's going to be worth money.
[72:25.23]I was delirious up there.
[72:33.79]I mean, it's an autograph of a top 1000 streamer, so it's gotta be worth like 30 cents.
[72:45.78]You once found my signature in a public bathroom.
[72:51.26]I don't use public bathrooms, so that's wrong.
[72:54.98]If you think that's a joke, that's not a joke.
[72:57.63]I don't use a public bathroom.
[73:04.18]To pee?
[73:04.68]It depends on how many people are in there.
[73:09.19]Here's what I'll do.
[73:09.79]Let's get this off.
[73:10.37]Let's talk about this real quick.
[73:13.99]So if I can determine that when I go into the bathroom, I do a real-time analysis.
[73:20.13]You know what I mean?
[73:20.65]Like, boom!
[73:22.00]Like, blue wave goes across the whole entire bathroom.
[73:25.14]Two guys in a stall.
[73:26.04]One guy at the sink.
[73:27.26]One guy at the urinal.
[73:29.28]No, no, no, no, no.
[73:30.16]There's too much calculated risk here.
[73:31.76]And I just go and I wash my hands.
[73:33.84]And that's like what I came into the bathroom to do.
[73:35.28]You know?
[73:37.95]That same scan happens and there's two stalls open, one guy at the sink, one guy at a urinal, like all the math plays out, the blue wave goes over and I got two openings right here.
[73:46.15]I don't have to pretend to wash my hands.
[73:47.89]I can just, I can just go to the bathroom.
[73:52.84]And I also will not take a shit in a public bathroom no matter what.
[73:55.14]I've never done it in my entire life.
[73:56.18]Not in my entire life.
[73:58.30]Not in my entire existence have I ever taken a shit in a public bathroom.
[74:04.68]It's never happened in 33 fucking years.
[74:10.21]Ever.
[74:15.43]Convincing story.
[74:16.55]Mr. IBS.
[74:17.51]I don't have IBS.
[74:18.27]I have IBD.
[74:19.99]IBD.
[74:23.17]That actually impossible?
[74:24.33]It's not.
[74:26.09]It's not.
[74:28.39]I have pants to shit in.
[74:31.00]That's not.
[74:32.00]No.
[74:32.58]That's not what I'm saying.
[74:36.44]A big donation?
[74:37.28]Oh jeez.
[74:40.36]Oh, no, somebody called me a big dodo.
[74:42.84]Oh.
[74:45.28]Thank you, G... G-trite?
[74:48.66]G-trit?
[74:49.70]Thank you for the... $10 here.
[74:51.44]I don't use Twitch much, but I gotta let you know that your vids over the years have helped me through a lot.
[74:55.19]Drew my heart.
[74:56.85]Thank you.
[74:58.99]Thank you so much.
[75:01.37]I never went to the bathroom at a pub in school.
[75:04.67]Six hours, seven hours is a long enough time where you don't have to go to the bathroom.
[75:07.99]You can hold it.
[75:09.61]I would pee.
[75:10.73]You pee, you know, four, three, four times a day, whatever.
[75:15.63]You don't have to go shit in six hours.
[75:17.24]You can hold it.
[75:19.44]Not if you have IBD.
[75:20.80]Well, I didn't get diagnosed with IBD until I was like 24.
[75:30.28]I've never even peed.
[75:31.20]Remember that time that I went to the zoo?
[75:41.69]It probably caused the IBD.
[75:43.83]No, IBD is like genetic.
[75:47.06]Hold on, wait, no, no, hold on.
[75:48.22]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[75:52.44]Just a second here.
[75:53.54]Why don't we make this, why don't we change the scenery?
[75:58.32]Let's get a new thing here.
[76:06.78]No, no, no, no.
[76:08.00]Bring him on.
[76:09.79]I wanna go in there.
[76:11.87]No, I don't want to update it.
[76:16.34]Go to update.
[76:18.14]Postpone the update.
[76:19.16]I don't want to update it yet.
[76:21.84]I can't.
[76:22.26]I have to update it now.
[76:23.52]Go to find.
[76:24.34]Update.
[76:25.94]Jesus.
[76:27.16]I got the Philips Hue.
[76:28.44]I've had them for a while and I put them in there.
[76:30.08]They're great.
[76:31.42]They're awesome.
[76:33.72]I'm going to do this crazy thing where I'm going to have the Philips Hue.
[76:37.48]And I don't know why I keep saying the word Philips just because it sounds like it's sponsored, but it's not.
[76:42.68]I'm going to have this thing be the moon at night and then transition to be like orange during the day so it'll slowly turn into the moon.
[76:50.73]Ha!
[76:52.29]That's pretty fucking cool, don't you think so?
[76:57.20]And then these lights are just normal.
[77:02.85]I don't get it.
[77:03.63]What do you mean you don't get it?
[77:05.45]The moon.
[77:05.81]This thing down here.
[77:07.54]That can be any color I want it to be.
[77:09.76]So I can make that orange.
[77:12.12]I can make it red.
[77:12.70]I can make it blue.
[77:13.20]I can make it green.
[77:14.04]So it's going to slowly go from red to orange to light to blue to magenta to yellow and then go to blue and be the moon.
[77:26.58]Make it purple.
[77:27.42]I have to update my Philips Hue apparently.
[77:32.28]yeah it'll be orange during the day alright what time does Red Dead come out alright so here's what's gonna happen I'm gonna give you guys like the real deal here's the reality so Red Dead Redemption 2 releases tomorrow I'm going to try my absolute hardest to play Red Dead Redemption 2 tomorrow if the internet is functioning which I hope it is get it at GameStop tonight
[78:05.74]It's out now?
[78:07.06]How?
[78:11.44]So pray that this is going to continue to be green into tomorrow.
[78:21.21]Because that would be very, very bad if it wasn't.
[78:23.51]Just know that we're trying.
[78:26.69]Max Rannis is out.
[78:30.87]The UK has it now.
[78:38.78]89 gigabytes in a 3 gig patch.
[78:40.99]That's going to take a while.
[78:44.67]It's 80 bucks?
[78:46.29]Yeah, I'm not looking up anything about it.
[78:48.23]I know there are spoilers already.
[78:52.57]Am I going to play something?
[78:53.33]Not today.
[78:53.73]Not right now.
[78:55.27]I need to land the balloon and come in and essentially make sure the internet works.
[79:01.52]Which it seems to be working.
[79:03.04]Dropped some frames, but I don't think that's that much of a problem, so...
[79:08.76]I'm gonna try to get as ready as I can for tomorrow afternoon.
[79:13.55]Alright, now let's, here, here, here, watch, watch, watch, ready?
[79:17.87]Let's make it, let's make this scene what we want it to be.
[79:27.73]See?
[79:28.99]Orange, orange chair, orange.
[79:33.87]Now it's a light, now it's actually the sun.
[79:40.34]Now we're green.
[79:41.10]Somebody said, why are you green?
[79:42.04]Let's go back to normal here.
[79:44.20]I can do twitch.tv lights, right?
[79:49.35]See, now the whole package is here.
[79:52.67]I'm a twitch.tv streamer in this light.
[79:59.73]Okay.
[80:03.27]Whoa, he's that guy on Twitch.
[80:04.53]He's that Twitch guy.
[80:07.72]Valentine's Day is coming up here next year.
[80:10.10]Not at all.
[80:12.36]But Valentine's Day, I'll do a Valentine's Day setup.
[80:16.22]St.
[80:16.54]Patrick's Day.
[80:19.60]Right.
[80:27.09]What's blue?
[80:31.01]I don't know, but I need a couple more in here.
[80:33.15]The office is not completely set up.
[80:38.41]But let me just go back to normal.
[80:41.43]That's fine.
[80:42.73]Because it is getting dark now.
[80:44.35]And it's weird because now it's 9 p.m.
[80:47.78]right now.
[80:48.72]Eastern.
[80:49.06]That's a strange thing to think about.
[80:50.22]Hey, we get it.
[80:53.76]You got cool lights.
[80:56.48]I know!
[80:56.90]What am I going to do?
[80:59.33]A house tour?
[81:00.43]Stop quoting the office thing!
[81:07.37]I wonder how I lost these 200 frames.
[81:10.17]Knife!
[81:10.47]No!
[81:10.77]That's a fake knife!
[81:11.81]That's not even a real... That's a... Oh, my gum for putting it down.
[81:15.81]So, let me... Let me get some things ready.
[81:20.70]Dude, for all... For all I fucking know, you guys may fucking even see me.
[81:27.20]If this shit comes out at 9, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, that's gonna be so late, though.
[81:35.83]let me see let me see I might just be insane and do it tonight you can download it now I might just get that ready and just see if I can do it might just do it tonight that'll be a good test of the internet as well so for all intents and purposes let me get everything ready
[82:00.08]This is about an hour and a half.
[82:01.22]Just wanted to make sure you guys knew that I made it.
[82:04.10]I'm here.
[82:05.68]And we will try Red Dead.
[82:11.46]Potentially in like a few hours.
[82:14.36]If not, then absolutely I'm going to try to do it tomorrow.
[82:17.28]Pray for this internet.
[82:18.96]Pray for the internet.
[82:19.66]Pray for the internet.
[82:20.28]Pray for the internet.
[82:20.94]Because damn would this be not cool if I couldn't stream tomorrow.
[82:27.24]Fix my sideburns.
[82:27.94]I'm just going to leave it.
[82:28.60]No.
[82:28.96]I'm leaving it.
[82:34.54]Where Etalyx is going to run a full stream test while I do a full stream test, so over the next couple of hours, we'll be able to tell.
[82:43.51]So it looks okay so far.
[82:47.67]But I am going to get going.
[82:48.67]I'm going to get the rest of this ready.
[82:49.63]I'm going to get the rest of this place set up.
[82:51.73]And I'm going to try to get it ready to stream.
[82:54.87]So let me make sure I didn't miss any large bits.
[82:57.63]And I apologize for not reading literally everything tonight.
[83:03.42]I don't have like the credits set up right now.
[83:06.14]I literally don't have anything.
[83:09.44]Etalyx has not been able to use the internet really for like almost a week straight.
[83:12.81]So that's what he told me when I was running up the stairs.
[83:17.27]But I'm going to keep these here so I can have them for later and I have that website as well.
[83:23.38]So we're ending the stream now for now and flip a coin whether or not I come back in like two or three hours because I might just do it.
[83:33.19]Anyways, I made it.
[83:35.27]I'm here.
[83:37.57]I got my stuff and I'm fucking ready.
[83:41.55]So pray for the internet.
[83:43.96]Expect a ton of streams here because now that we're allowed to go live and if we can stay live, yeah, it's going to happen probably every day.
[83:52.14]I've been antsy.
[83:53.26]I want to fucking do shit.
[83:56.08]See you real soon.
[83:57.88]Thank you for hanging out.
[83:59.02]I'll see you guys really fucking soon.
[84:01.26]Div USP right at the end.
[84:02.66]Ten bucks.
[84:03.66]I'll get to all these tomorrow.
[84:06.02]But thank you.
[84:07.02]Welcome back, Germans.
[84:07.65]Good to see you again.
[84:08.17]Hope you're doing well and congrats on the move.
[84:09.79]Thank you.
[84:11.19]See you guys real soon.
[84:13.07]Have a great rest of your night.
[84:14.79]And you might see me in like a few hours.
[84:17.07]Maybe.
[84:18.59]Take care.
[84:26.25]It's weird not having an ending screen.
[84:29.07]I gotta like get this done.
[84:33.23]Fucking UFO just flew over the house.
