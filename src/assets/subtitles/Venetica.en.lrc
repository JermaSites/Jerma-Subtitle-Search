[00:01.66]It's not Elix.
[00:03.96]I just saw it in the video game search engine.
[00:10.02]I said, I'm going to try it.
[00:11.10]If anybody knows what this is, then I'm good.
[00:14.84]That's cool.
[00:17.72]I don't know what this is, but it looked... The back of the box was... I don't know.
[00:23.10]It looked interesting.
[00:28.01]This is called Venetia.
[00:30.15]This is called Venet... Venet... Venetia.
[00:31.73]Venetia.
[00:32.49]Venetica.
[00:34.49]Venetia.
[00:35.75]However you say it.
[00:37.59]Venetica.
[00:42.18]Dark Spore.
[00:42.72]I've never heard of... I don't think anybody's heard of this game.
[00:52.54]Helvetica.
[00:54.66]Isn't that a cheese?
[01:09.51]Wait, what is this?
[01:14.37]Oh, it's a font.
[01:18.99]I thought it was a fucking cheese.
[01:20.49]Alright, let's start the game.
[01:24.71]Seven moons ago.
[01:26.75]Turn it up.
[01:29.01]Lara Croft.
[01:30.09]Just a slice.
[01:37.15]Are we still in the world of the living?
[01:40.43]Yes, we are.
[01:42.81]We will be here forever.
[01:46.09]I feel a weak presence, just a spark of life, but it could ruin it all.
[01:52.68]Yes.
[01:56.02]We need to find the source and remove it.
[01:59.46]I will do what you please, my new Archon.
[02:02.00]But where shall we start looking?
[02:06.07]I don't know anything about this game, guys.
[02:10.42]The mountains.
[02:11.38]Enemies can't see you while you're in Twilight World.
[02:14.28]Use this to your advantage to sneak past them or to get into a better position for an attack.
[02:20.93]Alright.
[02:26.87]Today.
[02:27.67]So that was seven moons ago.
[02:29.17]So that was like 700,000 years ago.
[02:36.12]This was today.
[02:48.55]What character am I?
[02:49.19]I can't believe it's midsummer already.
[02:51.34]Time seems to go by so quickly.
[02:53.70]No matter how long I spend with you, it never seems enough.
[02:57.26]You know I'm going tomorrow, so did you consider my offer?
[03:00.55]I did, and I would love to come with you, but I don't think I can.
[03:05.35]My destiny is not to be a hero.
[03:07.77]But my destiny is to be at your side.
[03:09.94]Just say the word, and I will stay here with you.
[03:12.58]No, Benedict, you can't stay here.
[03:14.40]I mean, look at you, standing here in that shiny mail.
[03:17.82]Don't waste your time in this village.
[03:19.40]Go and begin your training.
[03:21.34]I know it was always your dream.
[03:23.42]Me?
[03:23.88]I belong here.
[03:24.89]No matter what the people say, this is home to me.
[03:28.31]I'm no adventurer.
[03:29.67]Don't worry.
[03:30.65]To me, saving the world sounds so much easier than giving you all that you deserve.
[03:35.26]Why are we here?
[03:36.24]I don't know.
[03:37.28]Careful.
[03:38.12]Don't promise things you can't keep.
[03:39.94]What does this game have for a grade?
[03:41.54]Hey, Benedict!
[03:42.90]Come over here!
[03:43.80]Something's wrong!
[03:44.80]Paul, you really know how to spoil a special moment, don't you?
[03:48.98]Wait here.
[03:50.00]Don't you dare go away.
[03:56.49]Don't move.
[04:02.85]Oh no!
[04:03.68]Who are these people?
[04:04.90]Run for your lives!
[04:06.68]There's a lot of arrows.
[04:13.36]That was like 400- How many people are shooting?
[04:17.14]Do I get control of the character yet?
[04:18.64]Scarlet, quick!
[04:20.13]Come over here!
[04:23.37]To move your character, use the left stick.
[04:25.65]You can move camera with the right stick.
[04:32.81]Is there a jump?
[04:41.23]Watch out for the bell!
[04:41.95]Watch out for the bell!
[04:44.47]Oh, no!
[04:50.22]No!
[04:50.80]Reach out your hand!
[04:51.98]This person's dead.
[04:55.54]That kills you.
[04:56.56]You're dead.
[04:57.00]Stay there!
[04:57.68]I'll be with you in a moment.
[05:00.90]Any blood on her dress?
[05:02.70]Nope.
[05:06.67]Uh, what do I take?
[05:09.63]There's an item nearby.
[05:10.85]Use the action button X to pick up the object.
[05:12.73]You can generally use the action button to interact with objects or people.
[05:17.39]Pick up the poker.
[05:19.24]You just found your first weapon.
[05:20.40]Use R1 to draw the weapon and then press the action button to strike.
[05:27.86]I already like it.
[05:28.56]Alright, here's the... I gotta get in here, right?
[05:30.23]Alright, we got him.
[05:33.83]He's an assassin!
[05:36.79]That's pretty cool.
[05:41.75]This game's pretty good.
[05:47.60]This is a pretty good mobile game.
[05:51.74]This is a pretty good mobile game.
[05:59.85]Oh, come on!
[06:01.07]What kind of video game is this?
[06:04.38]Yeah, I really have played a mobile game that was like this.
[06:08.72]Five Dukats.
[06:12.58]Why do these guys have Slim Jim heads?
[06:19.40]When am I gonna get the in-game currency?
[06:25.50]She's wearing sandals.
[06:30.05]When do I get to learn my move?
[06:36.48]Why are you putting the sword down?
[06:43.80]Of course, like, you have to have a guy- Like, a guy has to come and save you.
[06:47.56]Okay.
[06:48.81]You had an opportunity- You were, like, killing people with swords and shit.
[06:51.13]They had to give this asshole the glory.
[06:55.31]For what?
[06:55.71]Because he's gonna die in, like, five seconds and we're supposed to feel bad.
[07:01.92]Look, he's dead.
[07:03.56]He's gonna go right in his back.
[07:07.71]You had to have the end here where he gets killed.
[07:12.91]What?
[07:13.86]Benedict!
[07:17.35]He's okay?
[07:17.73]They didn't write this that well.
[07:23.40]No armor on the back, yeah.
[07:25.36]Aren't you wearing armor?
[07:26.40]We didn't even get like five minutes to care about these two.
[07:47.78]I will always remember you.
[07:50.72]And I hope you always remember my cool lunge off the barn.
[07:56.87]I was practicing that for this very moment.
[08:06.69]Title.
[08:07.65]No.
[08:08.62]No, that was... Remember, that was seven moons ago.
[08:11.88]Who are you?
[08:13.56]There is no time to mourn your loss.
[08:15.24]That's cool.
[08:15.92]What is this?
[08:16.91]A dream?
[08:18.39]You are the only one who stands between life and eternal darkness.
[08:22.63]I don't understand.
[08:24.98]What is this about?
[08:26.62]You must heed my words.
[08:28.16]You have powers that you do not know of yet.
[08:31.32]You must learn to use these powers.
[08:33.71]It is essential.
[08:34.59]I do like this guy's costume.
[08:35.69]I'm going to beat this guy for Halloween next year.
[08:37.23]I have no powers.
[08:38.81]My love is dead and I could do nothing to help.
[08:42.05]I'm no warrior.
[08:43.83]Why did all this happen?
[08:45.57]All will be explained soon, but we must move quickly.
[08:49.30]There is much to learn, for only you have the power to grow, the power to change.
[08:53.44]Walmart Cthulhu.
[08:55.10]My world?
[08:56.66]There is nothing of value in this world for me anymore.
[08:59.29]This is the mall Santa equivalent of Cthulhu.
[09:01.47]You'll have to find somebody else.
[09:03.33]Listen, my daughter.
[09:05.07]I will give you my power and protection.
[09:07.89]There are many ways you can utilize my power.
[09:10.91]You will be able to see people again.
[09:13.85]See people that passed from your world.
[09:16.85]Benedict.
[09:18.07]Alternatively, you could use your force to crush those who did this.
[09:22.31]Seek them out.
[09:22.73]And by the way, what do you think of this?
[09:24.55]And he just, like, falls off his drape and he's naked.
[09:27.53]What the fuck is this?
[09:28.45]I don't... I am undecided.
[09:30.63]I am still undecided.
[09:33.13]You will have to make a decision soon.
[09:35.68]Whichever road you choose, your destination remains the same.
[09:39.98]You must find the Moonblade.
[09:42.40]Find where I hid it.
[09:44.20]Then travel to Venice and use it to defeat the undead Archon.
[09:49.06]There's a joke here somewhere.
[09:49.66]Yeah, he just goes like, start snapping photos, chat!
[09:51.96]And he, like, pulls up his drape.
[09:52.72]Would you guys take a screenshot?
[09:54.70]Okay, sleep.
[10:21.41]Are we gonna get, like, a fetch quest or something?
[10:23.01]Such a crude streamer.
[10:32.64]That was that was that was real low effort, but sometimes you get a low effort You mean you don't know that just makes this all the harder what you think you dreamt was no dream Although I wish with all my heart that it was This lady doesn't like a weird face candle wax Right here many of us have died
[10:59.46]My Joel, too, will never return home.
[11:02.38]It feels as though there's a veil obscuring my mind.
[11:04.12]Doesn't it look like these two should be in different video game universes?
[11:07.34]Don't worry.
[11:08.30]We all feel it.
[11:09.10]This is like a mobile hidden object game, and the other one is like Warrior Princess.
[11:15.16]Find something new to wear.
[11:16.45]Change out of those tattered clothes.
[11:18.41]Go ask Matheo.
[11:19.91]He has a daughter of your age.
[11:22.09]Oh god, my internet's dying.
[11:24.35]This game is so awful, it's killing my internet.
[11:27.92]I think we're dead.
[11:28.34]Are we still here?
[11:28.92]Hello?
[11:51.37]Uh-oh.
[11:52.19]I think we might be dying.
[11:54.41]I think this might be the... No?
[11:58.51]I think it's stabilized.
[12:00.79]Seems to be stable.
[12:02.53]Kind of.
[12:06.91]I'm just going to leave.
[12:07.51]Okay.
[12:08.13]What the hell was that?
[12:13.22]I need proper clothes.
[12:21.29]You can use beds to rest and regain energy.
[12:24.85]Use the action button when close to the bed and rest.
[12:27.33]It's like the time you want to wake up.
[12:33.90]Is this game open world?
[12:43.00]This is an open world game.
[12:45.99]You saved my life.
[12:47.05]How can I ever repay you?
[12:48.35]I know it's not much, but here.
[12:49.89]Take these ducats.
[12:50.75]They're all that I have.
[12:51.87]Okay.
[12:53.16]Uh, thanks.
[12:54.00]Thank you.
[12:56.64]Uh, no townspeople can be attacked.
[13:01.81]If you were curious.
[13:02.73]We just gotta get that out of the way.
[13:06.57]It's gonna be Skyrim shit right here.
[13:09.54]It's gonna zoom in on his face.
[13:10.54]Yeah, and here come the dialog options.
[13:12.06]Get out of the way, dude.
[13:12.82]He's really fucking up my cinematic universe.
[13:36.27]Okay, well.
[13:37.13]Thanks for your help.
[13:39.77]What did he want me to do?
[13:41.15]You saved so many of us.
[13:42.39]You clearly have to take this necklace.
[13:44.11]Okay, take this necklace.
[13:45.43]Thanks.
[13:46.47]Thank you.
[13:49.54]I'm taking anything I can get here, guys.
[13:54.86]Hey!
[13:55.48]Hey, stop!
[13:56.68]What are you, sleepwalking?
[13:58.20]Going into the wilderness with a torn nightdress?
[14:00.60]Huh?
[14:00.74]There are still thugs out there for your own sake.
[14:03.55]Wear something.
[14:04.11]Mind you, his daughter's a bit more than...
[14:06.28]So I gotta wait to the gun Blacksmith Okay, so we're gonna go to the blacksmith You have a dress that I can wear
[14:19.65]Hey, Scarlet, come inside my... Sorry, things aren't exactly ship-shaped.
[14:24.13]It's alright.
[14:24.91]Last night, the roof... Why is everyone so ugly?
[14:27.17]And my apprentice got a bit arrow-sick in the corner.
[14:29.99]Then to top it all off, I had to break my pliers over the long hat.
[14:34.50]Apart from that, though, it's been business as... Okay, I need some clothes, please.
[14:39.04]I'm looking for some new clothes.
[14:41.08]Looking as lovely as you are?
[14:43.32]Well, I can't help you find any clothes.
[14:46.02]But I've got a daughter about the same age as you.
[14:48.58]She keeps her clothes in a chest at my house.
[14:51.18]Just across the road.
[14:52.06]Feel free to help yourself.
[14:55.64]Just make sure you bring them.
[14:57.88]So, across the street.
[14:59.90]In the guy's house.
[15:04.33]Where's your house?
[15:05.15]Where's the blacksmith's house?
[15:06.05]Did he say up the road or did he say across the street?
[15:10.03]There is no street.
[15:11.95]There is no road.
[15:14.53]It's green dirt.
[15:18.59]There is his house.
[15:19.29]Okay, we're just going in.
[15:23.61]It has to load the house.
[15:24.61]I forgot.
[15:24.97]This is an old game.
[15:25.87]Okay, we got our frames back.
[15:32.96]Oh, no, we didn't.
[15:34.66]Alright, search the urban chest.
[15:36.34]This one's locked.
[15:40.92]Mm-hmm.
[15:42.00]Casual garments.
[15:43.50]Looted.
[15:44.14]If you buy or find items, you can view them in your inventory by pressing select.
[15:49.66]I can't just wear these?
[15:51.84]The tab shows your character's progress.
[15:53.50]On the top half, you see your current and maximum energy levels.
[15:55.94]On the bottom half, your attributes are displayed.
[16:00.84]There's a lot in this game.
[16:05.12]I gotta go back and get him to tailor it for me.
[16:14.02]Let's put on, let's put these clothes on.
[16:19.70]When did this game come out?
[16:20.96]This is maybe Roblox?
[16:22.95]Rombax.
[16:25.11]This game came out in... 33,301.
[16:26.75]No.
[16:30.41]That's, that's, that's their zip code.
[16:35.04]I was gonna say, this is a... Game came out a long time from now.
[16:44.15]Five to ten minutes.
[16:45.99]Listen.
[16:46.38]Hey, how can I help you?
[16:48.60]We have to get to the game first.

[17:52.97]Okay, hint.
[17:53.57]This is... Okay, this is skill tree.
[17:57.52]Mental skills?
[18:00.92]What in the name of God?

[18:24.87]Alright, let's go.
[18:26.15]On the mini-map, right?
[18:28.05]Whatever the hell that is.
[18:31.89]Well, let's go fight some creatures at 19 FPS.
[18:40.06]Oh, oh, there you are!
[18:41.62]They think I destroyed the village.
[18:44.28]Well, they're incorrect.
[18:46.68]This is the shortest game I ever played.
[19:09.06]I thought that was going to be one of those death situations where I went the wrong way.
[19:13.55]No.
[19:19.37]I have to compare everything to Dark Souls.
[19:22.35]We had no idea you were a demon.
[19:32.63]Sorry we killed you.
[19:34.27]If we knew you weren't a demon... No, you pay for your treason.
[19:37.34]Let's go.
[19:37.60]What's with this camera?
[19:38.82]What?
[19:39.06]Evil villager.
[19:39.50]Good.
[19:39.78]And your friend too.
[20:01.99]What you got on you?
[20:03.75]Nine Ds, five Ds.
[20:05.71]Alright.
[20:09.27]Our first mission complete.
[20:15.38]Is there a faster run?
[20:18.12]Is there a jump?
[20:18.82]Oh boy, I didn't know that.
[20:20.04]Okay, I'm looking for the quest marker, which is right there.
[20:24.08]Where am I?
[20:26.64]Right there.
[20:26.96]Okay, I'm going the right way.
[20:32.40]But they put too much stuff.
[20:33.86]You know, there's just too many trees.
[20:38.20]Too much foliage.
[20:39.04]This game's on PS1, man, if that isn't this.
[20:42.81]Ha ha ha ha ha!
[20:59.42]So who do I help here?
[21:00.12]I have to help the villager.
[21:07.00]I can't see a damn thing.
[21:12.77]You know, this is probably a pretty good game back in the day.
[21:16.93]I can see this being an interesting game.
[21:22.49]Somebody probably really likes this game.
[21:23.91]And that's fine, because this game is not inherently bad.
[21:27.77]Scarlet!
[21:29.30]Why did you have to go and
[21:32.61]No, no?
[21:32.93]It's not even fabled.
[21:33.57]Give me your sword.
[21:34.33]It's the Oblivion Killer.
[21:36.77]I got a new weapon.
[21:37.75]Well, that's... Relationships!
[21:38.79]Yikes!
[21:39.01]Alright, you've just reached a new level.
[21:40.73]You've gained attribute points and skill points.
[21:42.91]Press select to open the inventory.
[21:45.11]Should I...
[22:03.66]I got one more game to play.
[22:16.35]We're going to do the first quest.
[22:20.15]We're just going to do the first quest.
[22:22.77]So this is poker.
[22:24.83]I don't want this.
[22:25.35]So I have a dervish sword.
[22:27.97]Rusty sword.
[22:29.15]So we're going to put on the dervish sword.
[22:33.15]So let me level up.
[22:36.29]Every point into strength, because who cares?
[22:39.75]And then we got a skill point here?
[22:41.89]We got 20 skill points?
[22:48.54]I don't have any skill points.
[22:52.54]Well, whatever.
[22:58.11]I want to go rescue the brother, and then we have one more game that I have.
[23:04.56]The first quest was to get clothing.
[23:06.54]No, that doesn't count.
[23:08.26]That doesn't count.
[23:09.76]I did not spend... How much is this?
[23:14.49]What's happening?
[23:17.49]Oh, come on.
[23:19.58]What would you do with it anyway?
[23:21.10]You probably can't even read.
[23:23.96]Okay, Red Wizard versus Green Wizard.
[23:26.20]Stay away.
[23:26.92]This is family business.
[23:28.08]Who do I trust?
[23:28.76]Yes, and the controversy... Captain Hook sucks.
[23:32.10]I'm not doing, like, carrot-top Captain Hook.
[23:36.58]We're going to go with the guy on the left.
[23:37.88]What's going on here?
[23:40.10]What's going on here?
[23:41.53]Sometimes there are things in life that can only be solved by a good, old-fashioned duel.
[23:46.97]I agree.
[23:48.87]Well, I could use some help.
[23:50.81]No, help me.
[23:54.86]What's the problem?
[23:56.70]It's plain and simple.
[23:57.86]Our uncle died, and we both came here to claim the inheritance.
[24:01.61]One of us needs to go inside and look for his will.
[24:04.23]But this guy here is not to be trusted.
[24:06.85]Oh, yes, I am.
[24:08.41]You were always the villain.
[24:09.45]Always the villain?
[24:09.99]That's all I need to know?
[24:10.93]The problem is, the will will be hidden.
[24:13.92]There'll probably be some sort of puzzle.
[24:16.82]Our uncle was very fond of puzzles.
[24:19.00]Watch out, there's a puzzle in there.
[24:22.22]I'm gonna go search for it.
[24:28.09]Okay.
[24:34.01]Come on!
[24:34.69]You gotta give me the opportunity to do that.
[24:38.33]Go in the house.
[24:42.98]I'm not trusting Captain Hook.
[24:44.18]I'm giving the will to the guy in the green.
[24:49.89]These guys can settle their dumb, like, traffic light family bullshit somewhere else.
[24:55.72]This one's locked.
[25:01.04]Did the dad have a fucking yellow suit?
[25:08.27]There's gonna be bugs in here that I'm gonna have to fight.
[25:10.99]Okay, pick up the- I got pliers.
[25:14.71]Let's see, here comes the puzzle.
[25:16.93]Push the first crest.
[25:20.05]Okay.
[25:21.27]How about, like, the third crest?
[25:25.02]Oh, Uncle was so fond of puzzles.
[25:26.88]This fourth crest.
[25:29.04]And then this one, in the right order.
[25:36.02]Okay, so... Somewhere in Uncle's house is going to be the order that I need to do that in.
[25:42.04]Do I have a flashlight?
[25:51.14]Okay, I got some copper.
[25:53.74]And some... Duke Gats.
[25:59.16]Oh, Uncle, you always... Look, it's a... Oh.
[26:04.70]Oh, that's sad.
[26:05.44]Does Uncle have a forest in his house?
[26:12.57]Only 24 combinations.
[26:14.31]Start grinding.
[26:21.59]Just brute force.
[26:25.11]Have you found anything yet?
[26:26.61]Yeah.
[26:26.93]Keep your eyes open.
[26:29.55]He was very fond of puzzles.
[26:31.43]If I could just throw it.
[26:38.35]Okay, but I can't.
[26:44.53]If only you acquired nougat instead of doogat.
[26:51.65]In like a pot.
[26:52.43]No, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[27:00.05]I'm trying to like look in the pot.
[27:15.08]This is not an N64 game.
[27:16.34]This is a PS3 game.
[27:19.44]Shockingly enough.
[27:23.00]We need to solve the puzzle.
[27:24.10]Okay, the rat's head is crushed.
[27:27.90]So that leads me to believe cheese.
[27:33.76]Nothing else in here.
[27:35.60]I do have pliers.
[27:36.42]Does the pliers have something on it?
[27:41.81]The pliers probably have the combination on it.
[27:44.39]It's probably his favorite pair of pliers.
[27:46.09]The pliers are quite... Oh, no, this is just pliers for that blacksmith.
[27:51.88]Alright, so.
[27:53.42]If I were like a madman, what would I have this combination be?
[27:57.78]Let's just go down and look over here.
[28:01.39]Shoes?
[28:02.53]Nothing to do with the shoes.
[28:04.67]Something to do with the tree.
[28:05.65]This is locked.
[28:12.67]I'm going to guess.
[28:30.07]Got it.
[28:36.71]So, wait.
[28:40.71]Perhaps.
[28:42.11]Blind?
[28:42.65]What do you mean blind?
[28:43.45]No, you guys put it... 3, 4, 2, 1.
[28:51.87]What?
[28:52.07]I just did 3, 4, 2, 1.
[28:52.81]It better not be 1, 2, 3, 4.
[29:10.07]laughed my ass.
[29:11.15]Well, I gotta go look outside.
[29:12.77]The combination's on the ground.
[29:13.97]I gotta look down.
[29:17.51]Did you find anything yet?
[29:19.81]Yeah, and it's gonna be underneath them, underneath these shoes.
[29:23.37]Oh, that was 342, so I actually just got baited, for real.
[29:36.26]Okay.
[29:37.08]Look down.
[29:43.76]One, those are like broken.
[29:48.03]One, two, three, four?
[29:52.11]One, one, four.
[29:56.47]One, four, three, two.
[29:58.47]Or, one, two, three, four.
[30:03.83]Alright, it's one, two, three, four.
[30:08.50]No, fucking idiot!
[30:10.46]Look at it this way.
[30:14.80]Two... One, three, two, one, three, four, two.
[30:29.15]One, three, four, two.
[30:32.49]Two, four, three, one.
[30:47.54]1, 2, 1, 1.
[30:47.64]What are you looking sideways?
[30:50.06]I had my head tilted.
[30:52.64]2, 4.
[30:52.72]2, 4.
[30:52.76]1, 2.
[30:52.80]2, 4, 3, 1.
[30:52.88]Grandpa, what did you store in the back here?
[31:12.89]What the hell is going on?
[31:14.53]Alright, here it comes.
[31:16.01]There's the deed to the house.
[31:19.17]I'm giving it to the green guy.
[31:22.39]Everything should be given to Nesto.
[31:26.21]Okay.
[31:29.30]I don't care about the unseen blade.
[31:30.68]I want the key to the house here.
[31:35.54]That's how you go downstairs.
[31:40.54]No, red guy.
[31:41.48]I'm not giving it to the red guy.
[31:43.50]I don't trust him.
[31:45.12]I don't trust him at all.
[31:55.61]It should be given to Nesto.
[31:57.13]Sorry, Nesto.
[31:58.77]You found the will?
[32:00.31]Surprise, surprise.
[32:02.05]Now, let me see what the old fogey wrote down.
[32:05.06]Don't give it to him.
[32:06.08]He'll twist it for his own good.
[32:08.72]You'd best read it out to both of us.
[32:10.96]This place would make a great shelter for homeless children.
[32:15.17]See?
[32:15.49]Oh, fuck you.
[32:16.11]And you guys wanted me to give it to the guy in the red?
[32:20.33]Give to Don.
[32:21.33]Who wants to build an orphanage.
[32:23.13]Give it to Don.
[32:43.52]Wood in the forest.
[32:44.66]Which goes to me.
[33:13.18]It actually is me.
[33:27.91]Uh, okay.
[33:32.23]So your father wrote me into the will.
[33:36.46]You two that I've never met before.
[33:37.80]And I don't know who this person is.
[33:40.88]That's extremely entitled.
[33:43.74]I'm not part of your family.
[33:45.08]I don't know any of you.
[33:46.74]But that's my sword.
[33:48.00]Wow.
[34:00.39]Alright, open up the locks.
[34:01.33]Let me get into the Twilight Zone.
[34:03.65]What is this?
[34:04.02]Are they playing Simon Says?
[34:10.56]Or are they opening a door?
[34:14.32]Is that why they're dressed like this?
[34:15.84]The door is now unlocked.
[34:16.78]We'll wait for you outside.
[34:29.31]Let's go.
[34:29.99]First mission of the game.
[34:34.30]Sword at the ready.
[34:36.20]We have to investigate.
[34:36.88]We have to find the hidden, the holy moonlit sword.
[34:46.28]What's going on?
[34:52.07]Oh, I went to bed.
[35:03.43]Okay, I slept twice in a row.
[35:09.09]I pick up the bread.
[35:10.65]Bread received.
[35:12.17]Search the shrine.
[35:12.93]I gotta grab it with both hands and wiggle it around.
[35:16.76]I actually had to put the blade up there.
[35:27.36]Interesting.
[35:32.30]So this is the moonlit blade.
[35:33.72]The thing that my little friend had.
[35:40.35]Moonblade broken.
[35:41.95]Wait.
[35:44.01]What?
[35:45.07]Did I actually pick it up?
[35:48.65]I think I got it.
[35:50.08]It's broken.
[35:50.54]I have to take it back to the barber and he fixes it for me.
[35:57.88]We have the teeth pliers and the broken sword.
[36:00.72]We can bring that to the barber.
[36:09.93]I'm not totally invested, but I'm invested enough to care to keep going.
[36:13.19]Look, I found it.
[36:16.12]Still, looks pretty battered.
[36:18.22]Maybe you should let a smith take it.
[36:20.12]Speaking of which, how can you be sure you're the one the blade was intended...
[36:25.66]I suggest you bite your tongue, or you'll be the first to find out.
[36:28.48]Both of you shut up.
[36:29.16]Now that our dispute is set, and regarding these strange foreigners on the road, strange for once.
[36:36.68]I need to get to Venice.
[36:37.74]Wait, I'm going to Venice?
[36:40.91]But first, we need to be sure you won't get cut into pieces by the next rogue that comes by.
[36:46.69]So...
[36:47.71]What?
[36:48.07]You wanna- Dave, you wanna fight me.
[36:49.43]And he's gonna teach me how to play.
[36:52.33]Well, first what you have to do is press L1.
[36:53.87]Oh lord.
[36:54.07]Ooh.
[37:12.09]Oh shit, I skipped it.
[37:15.55]What did he say?
[37:17.12]Focus on your enemy holding L2 and press square to roll.
[37:28.39]Dead.
[37:29.29]Killed him.
[37:31.06]I slid him from ass to eyeballs.
[37:34.83]The next thing to learn would be performing combined attacks.
[37:39.07]But for today, this should suffice.
[37:42.19]You did surprisingly well.
[37:44.09]Maybe you'll stay alive until we reach the coast.
[37:47.57]Well, if you carry on training, you might... Okay, um, goodbye.
[37:54.58]I will get even further.
[37:55.90]Revenge will go on any... Oh, and a good...
[38:00.75]Just kidding.
[38:01.95]Watching this is more stressful than Harvester.
[38:08.37]Yeah, you know what?
[38:09.97]You know what?
[38:10.81]I got one more game.
[38:13.49]I have no idea.
[38:14.29]I saw it.
[38:14.65]I just had to get it.
[38:18.03]I'm going to give it a try.
[38:25.48]This is going to be a while in here.
[38:29.63]The final game we're gonna play... I don't have very much time.
[38:34.88]I have about, like, 30 minutes left.
[38:37.20]Is, uh... Def Jam Icon.
[38:40.28]You fight... It's a fighting game, but you fight each other with, like, music and shit.
[38:43.94]It looks pretty crazy.
[38:48.66]I'm gonna stop playing Velveeta Helvetica.
[39:03.90]Give me one sec.
[39:10.32]From all the trailers and stuff that I saw, it looks fucking crazy.
[39:18.99]We'll find out.
[39:24.79]It's not a fighting game that you think.
[39:26.31]It's not like what you think it is.
[39:29.83]It's changing.
[39:33.35]That's Patches' voice actor?
[39:36.49]Holy shit.
[39:38.71]You still love this game?
[39:43.61]Apparently it's pretty fun.
[39:45.59]We'll play it for like 20-30 minutes before I get going.
[39:48.39]Let me change the title.
[40:04.42]Alright.
[40:05.67]So.
[40:07.41]Do a 24 hour stream.
[40:09.35]No this was just like.
[40:10.67]I was going to play Hand of Fate.
[40:12.73]But it decided.
[40:13.97]There was only like 3 or 4 PS3 games.
[40:18.55]So.
[40:20.71]Why not just make.
[40:22.05]Get it over with and get them done.
[40:25.35]Figured it was.
[40:26.75]I figured it was the smart thing to do.
[40:30.19]You know what I mean.
[40:36.09]Okay, hold on.
