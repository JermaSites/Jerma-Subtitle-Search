[00:01.15]good morning what's up welcome to another stream today we're gonna play the chronicles of riddick assault on dark Athena
[00:21.82]But actually, it's the Chronicles of Riddick.
[00:24.66]Escape from Butcher's Bay.
[00:27.06]Which is... Assault on Dark Athena is the game.
[00:31.49]It's a remake of Butcher's Bay that added a campaign on top.
[00:36.11]Some weird development issues happened.
[00:42.97]This game is a remake of the last game.
[00:45.53]With a small campaign added on top.
[00:47.41]So we're playing the remake.
[00:49.63]This is bullshit!
[00:57.54]Dark Athena is the sequel.
[00:58.86]Dark Athena is the sequel, but it has a remade Butcher's Bay in it.
[01:05.24]Go look it up.
[01:05.74]There's a lot of things of how assets were being sold during, I believe, was it THQ?
[01:11.57]I don't want to make this up.
[01:12.85]Let's see.
[01:14.39]I think it was something to do with that, right?
[01:17.37]Saw Waiting Room?
[01:18.15]Well, don't worry.
[01:18.67]Saw 2 is going to be really soon.
[01:22.77]Yeah, I have a confession to make, though.
[01:25.11]I have never seen any of the Riddick movies at all.
[01:29.91]I have no idea what this is.
[01:32.20]All I know is that the character wears sunglasses.
[01:34.04]I have no idea what's going on.
[01:35.98]I remember watching the trailer list for this movie back in the day.
[01:38.96]There's like four of them or three of them or something.
[01:42.44]And people liked them.
[01:44.86]From my understanding, this game is not just a movie game.
[01:50.34]This is a completely new campaign that Vin Diesel himself oversaw.
[01:55.96]Am I getting that right?
[01:57.65]So this is not just a movie tie-in.
[02:02.35]Vin Diesel made this game.
[02:04.13]Like, he made it happen.
[02:06.69]He's in it, he voices it, he wrote all the dialog, and he programmed all the encounters.
[02:11.55]So can we give it up for Vin Diesel for just a moment, please?
[02:21.07]Thank you.
[02:24.55]Alright, are you guys ready?
[02:28.13]I'm ready to go.
[02:31.57]I've been ready for about 25 minutes.
[02:36.48]I have no references to make for the Chronicles of Riddick, so making a title was impossible.
[02:41.28]So I just reached into the YouTuber handbook and I got a good one.
[02:51.78]Okay, here we go.
[02:53.60]This is Escape from Butcher's Bay, but it's Dark Athena.
[03:01.97]See?
[03:02.21]See?
[03:02.51]See, I told you.
[03:04.37]There were people in chat going, you idiot.
[03:09.31]Oh, who's the idiot, huh?
[03:11.73]It ain't me.
[03:16.69]Literally, no one did that.
[03:17.89]I'm making up somebody to be angry at.
[03:20.67]No one did that.
[03:21.51]Not one person.
[03:24.01]I'm just making everybody think that there's some person in the chatroom that I'm angry at.
[03:28.71]This did not happen.
[03:30.01]I just want to make sure that's pretty clear.
[03:34.29]Alright, let's go.
[03:35.49]This is from 2004, by the way.
[03:37.19]Oh, we gotta test the audio.
[03:43.91]One, two.
[03:45.65]One, two.
[03:47.33]One, two.
[03:48.75]We synced up?
[03:52.05]Sounds good to me.
[03:55.11]One, two.
[03:56.77]One, two.
[03:58.58]One, two.
[04:00.86]One, two.
[04:05.08]Slightly off.
[04:06.26]It's delayed.
[04:08.77]My voice is early.
[04:10.09]Hold on.
[04:10.97]This is really important to do this.
[04:12.99]Otherwise, it's going to be fucked up the whole stream.
[04:14.49]Alright, hold on.
[04:20.98]One, two.
[04:22.92]One, two.
[04:24.74]One, two.
[04:26.16]Better?
[04:26.38]Here we go.
[04:33.54]One, two.
[04:34.00]One, two.
[04:34.72]One, two.
[04:35.19]One, two.
[04:35.93]One, two.
[04:36.27]One, two.
[04:36.69]One, two.
[04:43.94]Butcher's Bay.
[04:44.94]I'm going to play on normal.
[04:46.04]I don't want to fuck this up.
[04:46.86]2004 hard, guys, is not the same as 2020 hard.
[04:52.08]2004 hard is you get shot once and die.
[04:53.36]No.
[04:53.42]I'm not doing it.
[05:07.20]No, this is 2004.
[05:07.74]This is Escape from Butcher's Bay.
[05:11.14]What even is this bit?
[05:13.54]What bit?
[05:14.26]I'm picking a difficulty.
[05:17.92]I don't understand this joke.
[05:24.69]I mean, what is this?
[05:26.51]Is this like pick a door and one of the doors is going to have like something funny behind it?
[05:31.59]Difficulty bit.
[05:34.17]Alright, I'm gonna just pick normal.
[05:35.85]I don't care.
[05:36.23]Make fun of me.
[05:36.97]You can make fun of me all stream if you want.
[05:40.41]It's already done.
[05:41.21]It's too late.
[05:41.93]I can't go back.
[05:42.43]Alright, quiet!
[05:57.95]We're moving again.
[05:58.73]They just transmitted a safe route through the minefield.
[06:02.32]That minefield's offering better odds than you're going to get taking me to Butcher Bay.
[06:06.65]You think Hoxie's memory is that short?
[06:08.79]He gets one look at you, Riddick, and all is forgiven.
[06:12.43]And I bank your bounty plus 50.
[06:14.21]Plus 50?
[06:15.96]Now come on, Johns.
[06:18.24]Greed is an ugly thing.
[06:20.24]You're in no position to negotiate, Riddick.
[06:31.28]I'm excited.
[06:32.17]This is a very highly requested game.
[06:34.33]I'm excited to play this one.
[06:36.09]I feel like he can just like duck down and slip out of this.
[06:40.17]He can just go underneath the bottom bar.
[07:11.79]Alright, here we go.
[07:15.29]One person, you're right, one person requested this game.
[07:18.21]They're gonna be really happy.
[07:28.92]What happened?
[07:34.06]Oh, this game sucks though.
[07:35.69]You don't know that.
[07:37.37]Who told you that?
[07:38.85]You know, how do you have any idea?
[07:41.90]Walk up to a character and press Y to initiate dialog mode.
[07:45.55]Press Y to speak after selecting your response.
[07:58.66]What happened to my controller?
[08:04.98]Why did that happen?
[08:09.60]Did I game too hard?
[08:11.87]Okay, walk up and initiate conversation.
[08:16.96]Okay.
[08:18.46]What about the guy behind you?
[08:19.48]He's moving.
[08:20.08]Let Johns know he should cool down.
[08:22.92]Scare Johns about being ripped off.
[08:26.91]Scare him.
[08:27.41]He just stepped on his head.
[08:28.73]Wait, am I not supposed to move?
[08:48.42]WHY?!
[08:48.86]It's because- I know why.
[08:54.25]I know why.
[08:54.83]I know why.
[08:55.41]I know why.
[08:55.97]I know why.
[08:57.51]This is kind of loose.
[08:58.45]That's not good.
[08:58.91]I have to tape this.
[08:59.57]I don't know about you guys, but seriously, like, I'm like a fucking animal when I have, like, a controller and I have to, like, tap a button.
[09:07.92]When I tap, like, right trigger, I'm actually pressing every button and I'm squeezing really hard.
[09:15.57]The thing that's holding the battery on is gonna fall off.
[09:18.33]This is red light, green light.
[09:21.53]Yeah?
[09:21.77]Wait, what?
[09:22.01]He didn't hear me?
[09:44.87]How do you not hear him?
[09:47.23]Sneak up behind Johns and grab him by pressing left trigger to silently break his neck.
[09:52.93]You can also perform a faster but louder neck break by pressing right trigger.
[09:58.42]Break his neck.
[10:01.00]I don't want to.
[10:02.76]Why don't you do it?
[10:10.95]Whoa, come!
[10:13.01]Hyrule!
[10:14.41]No, it's gonna break his neck!
[10:15.72]How do I get in?
[10:17.42]Where am I?
[10:17.94]Get in!
[10:18.22]Get in here quick!
[10:19.96]Oh shit, that guy got fucking killed.
[10:23.18]What?
[10:25.24]Jump!
[10:45.53]It goes into third person?
[10:46.61]That's awesome.
[10:48.45]Oh, and you got a Dark Souls drag down?
[10:50.35]Are you kidding me?
[10:52.49]Cigarettes?
[10:52.91]That's a pat- yup.
[10:55.29]Extra content.
[10:56.03]Butcher Bay is now available in the extra content menu.
[10:58.91]I feel like this is too dark.
[11:05.18]Did I make the brightness a little bit higher?
[11:06.44]I'm not a boss?
[11:09.28]How?
[11:12.76]Make it a little bit high- a little bit higher?
[11:16.83]55?
[11:21.01]It's a little better, I think.
[11:23.29]Okay, so now, now what do we do?
[11:30.91]Wait.
[11:33.68]You can fight hand-to-hand with enemies.
[11:35.34]Press R, P to punch and L, T to block.
[11:37.66]Try to move in different directions and punch at the same time to perform different strikes.
[11:42.30]Unspotterize.
[11:43.12]Unspotterize.
[11:43.64]Unspotterize.
[11:44.88]Unspotterize.
[11:48.56]Unauthorized.
[11:57.77]My god.
[11:58.61]Okay, I think he's dead.
[12:03.15]How can you be unauthorized to pick up a gun?
[12:05.53]I don't understand.
[12:07.01]Ooh, security card.
[12:11.03]It just showed you that they're locked.
[12:12.19]Yeah, well, I'm... What do you want me to do?
[12:21.14]They already explained it.
[12:22.04]Yeah, but my controller was, like, falling out.
[12:26.36]I'm trying to be very, very careful with the controller right now.
[12:31.44]Anything over here?
[12:31.88]No.
[12:38.65]While in stealth mode, press X for stealth.
[12:41.71]You sneak silently.
[12:43.11]A blue screen effect indicates that no one can see you.
[12:50.21]Well, he can't see me?
[12:52.77]It's just me in the shower, man.
[12:59.00]Drop him.
[13:00.88]Yeah.
[13:02.26]Yeah.
[13:02.44]Yeah.
[13:10.66]Hide the body.
[13:11.66]It's completely dark.
[13:12.83]Hold the left bumper down and move left, right, or forward and lean in that direction, releasing you will do lean mode.
[13:25.35]Drag a body, stand close to the body, and press Y. Press Y again.
[13:28.58]You must be in stealth mode to do this.
[13:35.90]Okay, there are probably other guards around.
[13:37.90]Hide this body in the dark or his friends will be alerted when they find him.
[13:40.58]It's like Hitman.
[13:44.29]Wait, me being invisible, does that make him invisible too?
[14:05.85]Throw him in the vent?
[14:09.73]Leave him in the dark.
[14:10.73]If you climb up something, press Y. Okay, well, I'll leave him over here.
[14:14.45]This is dark.
[14:19.86]You can tell when it's dark because it gets blue.
[14:21.14]Yeah, he's good.
[14:32.08]The third person is... I love that.
[14:33.78]It's so funny.
[14:36.34]My game stopped doing that, didn't they?
[14:37.90]How do I climb up?
[14:45.42]Use a hang row, look at it and press Y or jump onto it by pressing A. There's a hang row above you.
[14:51.18]Drop from a hang row, press Y. Okay.
[14:53.34]Hang row.
[14:53.80]What else you got?
[14:55.68]You can drop down on enemies that are far below to kill them and break your fall to your best.
[15:01.72]That's so clumsy.
[15:04.49]I thought it was gonna be like, use your intuition to throw a batarang.
[15:07.41]No, no, no, no.
[15:07.91]Just fall on people and kill them?
[15:09.37]I mean, I can't even see.
[15:22.11]Alright, I gotta hide this guy.
[15:48.27]Okay, we're good.
[15:48.69]I mean, it's very, you're gonna obviously see that, dude, but whatever.
[15:57.72]Scan my eyes.
[15:58.32]What does it want me to do now?
[16:03.28]Can I open this door?
[16:09.73]On the vent?
[16:12.93]It came out of here, right?
[16:17.66]Have something on you?
[16:21.62]You have, like, a key card?
[16:23.36]Just climb it again.
[16:34.77]Sorry, this whole game looks like a layer of cooking oil put on it.
[16:50.73]PS3 no no no no you got it wrong.
[16:52.39]You got it wrong.
[16:52.93]This is the Xbox 360 It's much better console in PS3 now shut up it's better no idiot Rating
[17:16.30]A med station takes away the hurt, leaves the pain.
[17:19.66]This is like half-lifestyle med stations?
[17:22.67]Why do I feel like I'm really small?
[17:25.55]This nanomed health unit is empty.
[17:27.59]In order to refill it, you need to find a refill cartridge and then replace the empty one in the nanomed unit by pressing Y. Okay.
[17:37.94]What do I have?
[17:38.66]Two chunks?
[17:43.04]You can use this refill cartridge to restore an empty nanomed health unit.
[17:52.07]Why?
[17:52.45]Does it do the Half-Life sounds?
[17:57.89]I wouldn't want to use this.
[18:01.58]Don't you think you... If you have like a bruised elbow, don't you think you just want to let it heal in like a few days?
[18:07.30]Alright, does this thing... Okay, that's ready to go.
[18:13.31]That's horrifying.
[18:15.27]Alright, we got to be ready.
[18:15.99]We got to lean.
[18:17.97]Nothing.
[18:24.93]Disarmor guard, press right trigger when he tries to hit you.
[18:28.37]There's a parry?
[18:31.91]Just take the gun.
[18:36.62]Got it!
[18:42.18]Shoot!
[18:42.42]You have a gun with no bullets?
[18:44.78]What the hell are you doing?
[18:45.74]Is this just for show?
[18:49.82]Hold down right bumper and move around to select a weapon.
[18:57.59]Oh, he did.
[18:58.11]No, that's a pack of cigarettes.
[19:00.57]This guy doesn't have any bullets.
[19:03.35]Tools?
[19:08.17]He was on break?
[19:11.20]So?
[19:12.02]Alright, let's go.
[19:12.64]Dude, I don't care if somebody finds him.
[19:17.18]What does that even matter?
[19:18.70]While hanging, you can move sideways.
[19:23.42]Oh, no.
[19:23.64]Somebody's going to find him.
[19:24.70]I don't care.
[19:35.39]What are Riddick's superpowers?
[19:38.81]Press right stick to initiate weapon melee attack.
[19:42.48]Cool.
[19:50.38]He's cool.
[19:53.99]Oh, he can see in the dark.
[19:55.07]Alright.
[20:00.67]Guards and shotguns.
[20:01.93]I have to kill him to take it.
[20:08.92]Okay.
[20:12.80]There's one.
[20:15.09]Is there only one there?
[20:15.83]Let's see.
[20:16.15]There's one.
[20:17.51]This guy's just talking about how bad his day was.
[20:19.41]It's just the same shit that I do.
[20:22.51]When I'm in, like, a car and there's nobody with me, I just, like, go off.
[20:26.07]Go off, dude.
[20:26.69]Let's see it.
[20:27.09]Does he stay there forever?
[20:37.16]No, break his neck.
[20:42.32]Break his neck!
[20:43.22]Put this gun away.
[20:48.04]Break his neck.
[20:49.30]Left trigger.
[20:50.82]Good.
[20:58.65]What are you talking about this guy?
[21:03.85]Alright, I have gun, right?
[21:04.69]Oh, there's 47 bullets now.
[21:07.73]We went from zero to this guy has way too many.
[21:10.41]Okay, let's go in the sewers.
[21:24.67]Where's the way down?
[21:26.35]Sewers.
[21:28.12]Jump down.
[21:33.89]Locked.
[21:35.05]Not a problem.
[21:36.67]I'll blast it off.
[21:40.21]Cool.
[21:41.49]Oh, the gunplay.
[21:42.95]Oh, the gunplay.
[21:43.63]You know what I mean?
[21:44.09]It's actually kind of terrible.
[21:50.51]The dark.
[21:51.91]My favorite.
[21:55.45]Well, it's not my favorite.
[21:56.59]Do you have a flashlight for those of us that can't see in the dark, Riddick?
[22:02.36]Yes, you do.
[22:03.28]Thank you.
[22:03.74]The flashlight attached to shotguns can be used by- Well, why does he need this?
[22:10.54]What are you doing down here?
[22:14.11]Okay.
[22:28.09]Sewer guards.
[22:31.58]We gotta make sure we guard the sewers.
[22:37.99]Wait, did I shoot him or did he hit his head on the ceiling jumping?
[22:42.51]I don't know.
[22:43.85]Is he dead?
[22:44.33]I got a dead body.
[22:50.53]Unauthorized.
[22:55.20]Yeah, you do.
[22:56.12]You've got two.
[22:56.88]Inmate on the run.
[22:58.48]Hey, prisoner.
[23:00.06]Show yourself.
[23:03.65]Turn the flashlight off.
[23:06.09]Don't worry.
[23:06.35]He'll eventually turn this corner.
[23:09.58]That's Jake the dog.
[23:10.68]Yes, it is.
[23:15.17]Wait.
[23:35.00]Shit!
[23:35.30]He turned the light on.
[23:36.00]Wait, he killed me.
[23:39.48]Why did I die instantly?
[23:40.40]I was trying to put the body right next to him.
[23:43.48]How did I die instantly?
[23:44.56]I don't understand.
[23:45.79]He killed me instantly.
[23:46.59]I had four health blocks.
[24:04.01]What did he say?
[24:04.79]I'm gonna die, dude.
[24:06.93]This game's not hot.
[24:07.77]This game's fucking... Okay, something else exploded.
[24:13.52]Why is it dying right down here?
[24:15.48]I don't remember this happening in the movies.
[24:20.62]Alright, I'm fucking going for it now.
[24:22.21]I'm not gonna fucking run.
[24:23.77]Well, nothing here.
[24:25.43]Keep looking.
[24:30.67]I need to see, alright?
[24:31.87]I don't care if the game's about not seeing.
[24:34.81]Oh my god!
[24:36.25]Are they dead?
[24:46.47]Wait, what is that?
[24:50.13]I just gotta... What did I pick up?
[24:53.55]Like a hologram?
[24:54.29]How do you reload?
[25:02.64]You know, I can't think of something in a more stupid idea than to put exploding fucking barrels down under the gas lines of the town.
[25:20.91]Rise and shine.
[25:33.58]Yeah.
[25:34.02]Boss, where should we put the sixth exploding barrel?
[25:37.28]I don't know.
[25:38.16]Over in the corner.
[25:39.78]Rise and shine, jackass.
[25:42.76]Wait, I was asleep the whole time?
[25:43.94]Don't act like you're asleep.
[25:46.29]It's time for you to earn me some money.
[25:48.33]You might want to be careful with that, Johns.
[25:51.01]You could hurt somebody.
[25:53.97]Butcher Bay.
[25:55.61]You know, you always take me to the nicest places, Johns.
[25:58.97]I know the food's good as well.
[26:01.53]I can't say I'm gonna miss you, Riddick.
[26:03.11]No, don't.
[26:04.71]But, Johns... Looks like that memory's still... Is this like the evil asshole final enemy?
[26:12.36]My Hoxie's a businessman.
[26:13.78]They already did this.
[26:14.50]Now play nice, and we can get this over with quickly.
[26:17.12]It's already over, Johns.
[26:19.70]Secure your weapon, Johns.
[26:22.86]Good to see you too, warden.
[26:24.24]So, the famous Mr. Riddick.
[26:26.40]The Hawks.
[26:27.40]Finally come to stay, eh?
[26:29.16]Well, at this moment, Butcher Bay owns your ass.
[26:32.99]I own your ass.
[26:35.29]He's all yours once I sign him over, Hoxie.
[26:39.01]You're not going to be a problem, are you, Riddick?
[26:41.01]Because my boys and I like solving problems.
[26:44.94]John said you were ugly up close.
[26:47.42]For the first time, I let her agree with him.
[26:51.08]Hmm.
[26:51.89]Nice try.
[26:53.57]Vin Diesel does this thing where he, like, purr talks.
[26:56.27]He's, like, purring like a kitten.
[26:57.29]Bounty plus 50 on Riddick.
[26:57.99]Right, Hoxie?
[27:07.18]I think Riddick about covers what you owe me, Johns.
[27:10.44]There's plenty other slams I can take Riddick to if you can't afford it.
[27:13.26]Vin Diesel should play a cool cat in an animated movie.
[27:16.93]Can't you see him?
[27:17.73]A cool cat with sunglasses on.
[27:20.37]Perfect.
[27:21.27]Riddick stays at Butcher Bay.
[27:23.07]Period.
[27:23.61]Full stop.
[27:24.49]Let's get him processed.
[27:25.68]Yes, sir.
[27:27.14]I like that one.
[27:29.38]Johns.
[27:31.16]Better luck next time.
[27:35.99]Okay, so we're doing this again.
[27:37.91]Can you just run?
[27:39.21]Oh, come on.
[27:41.42]I feel like this is what the new Star Wars experience at Disney World is going to be like.
[27:50.56]Ooh, it's me.
[27:51.98]I'm the prisoner.
[28:05.09]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[28:08.28]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[28:09.10]Where are we going?
[28:09.88]Oh, yeah, yeah, lock me up.
[28:12.84]Oh, wow, look.
[28:16.57]Hey, I better watch out for those guards, right?
[28:21.47]Just wait till they start doing this shit.
[28:24.49]I can't wait for that, by the way.
[28:25.57]That, like, Star Wars experience where, like, you get, like, arrested and you have to, like, fight Kylo Ren.
[28:30.71]That's, like, a $4,000 experience that I'm absolutely going to have.
[28:33.87]Aren't gremlins in this?
[28:54.15]Look at that.
[28:54.45]Look at that actor.
[28:56.39]On his resume it said he could spin guns and shit.
[28:58.69]I love this.
[28:59.29]Come on, give me shit.
[29:04.68]I hear a large crowd.
[29:13.59]Why do I hear a crowd?
[29:25.14]This is gonna turn into Arkham Asylum, isn't it?
[29:27.48]That was a pretty sick walk
[29:58.04]Well, I mean, I have been taking probiotics that's supposed to help with that, but whatever, I won't correct you.
[30:09.66]And by the way, the menu is on the table on the right.
[30:26.83]It's happy hour right now, by the way.
[30:28.66]Get in there, scumbag.
[30:29.68]Oh, okay.
[30:48.14]Nobody likes the... Nobody likes the, like, Disney World experience restaurant?
[30:53.39]Oh, okay.
[31:00.78]Cleansing routines.
[31:03.00]An indignity of slam life.
[31:05.87]Lets the mercs think they're in charge.
[31:07.97]Oh, I have to put my hands in the toilet?
[31:10.49]The foolish belief that they're in control.
[31:13.27]It'll be their downfall.
[31:14.47]Okay, flush toilet is... I open the menu?
[31:18.30]Barber outside your cell might help you locate the weak spot of this slam.
[31:22.00]Remember that security will notice and take action if you have weapons.
[31:32.34]I was crouching that whole time.
[31:36.48]Okay, I gotta get... Why is the door open?
[31:39.34]Hey, come talk to me for a second, will you?
[31:42.64]Am I supposed to be locked in here?
[31:45.88]You're Riddick, right?
[31:47.26]There's a guy named Madsen talking like he knows you.
[31:50.31]He's in the courtyard just by the pit.
[31:52.01]Okay.
[31:53.59]Thanks a lot, dude.
[31:55.17]You are in violation.
[32:07.41]do that?
[32:12.71]I love games that let me do that.
[32:15.75]You know that if your video game allows me, even if there's a stupid little cutscene where you have to run, if I can just punch a guy and get in trouble for it, I like that.
[32:24.47]That's good that they did that.
[32:25.35]A lot of games don't care.
[32:26.17]I don't know what Maxon wants with you, but I'd go check it out if I were you.
[32:32.90]I can't break his neck though, right?
[32:34.78]This is hostile activity now.
[32:38.52]Alright, I promise I'm done.
[32:39.50]I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.
[32:40.32]I just want to see if I can break his neck.
[32:48.09]Because you know, you do realize that if I could break his neck, I would have ran around and broke everybody's neck and the whole fucking entire floor.
[32:52.56]He doesn't even want to talk to me anymore.
[32:54.86]He's just like, what if I don't look at him?
[33:00.86]I feel like I have been unfriended.
[33:02.85]Okay.
[33:04.98]Who are you?
[33:05.30]It's the Cozart brothers, aka the Torture Twins.
[33:08.70]Locked down yesterday.
[33:09.76]Managed to get hold of some poor side, obviously.
[33:11.96]Okay.
[33:19.47]My device.
[33:21.01]Do it like all the other fish.
[33:22.67]Line up behind the rocks.
[33:23.75]I have to just take my hand off the right trigger.
[33:27.25]I can't help it.
[33:29.10]You see this fish?
[33:31.44]All thanks to Molina.
[33:34.66]Waste him when they open his cell.
[33:37.28]Oh.
[33:38.16]I'll make it worth your while.
[33:39.72]When they open his cell.
[33:42.46]What is he going to do for me, though?
[33:44.91]I don't, I mean, I'm not sure if I want to agree to this because this guy's going to be my companion or something.
[33:50.31]Looks like he gets his ass kicked all the time.
[33:57.93]Uh.
[34:01.68]Yeah, I'll do it.
[34:02.56]Maybe.
[34:02.80]Maybe.
[34:04.63]Okay.
[34:04.79]What was the guy's name?
[34:06.97]What cell is his?
[34:09.55]Hey, what cell is Molina's?
[34:10.83]Okay.
[34:12.61]When I open his cell, kill him.
[34:13.55]Alright, now I gotta go.
[34:14.33]I gotta go this way.
[34:31.96]This game's pretty cool.
[34:35.46]I like this game.
[34:36.16]This is cool.
[34:43.27]Alright, let's go over here.
[34:46.23]Who's in here?
[34:47.95]Why?
[34:48.23]It'll work.
[34:50.31]No fucking way, no.
[34:51.63]It will.
[34:53.53]New guy.
[34:54.66]If I were you, I'd get the shiv.
[34:58.93]Alright, I'm the toilet guy.
[35:00.17]That's how people know me.
[35:01.73]That's how you'll remember me.
[35:06.45]Is it Arnold?
[35:07.18]Alright, I gotta find this way to get out of here.
[35:13.98]Here we go.
[35:14.24]Jack.
[35:15.04]You got that right.
[35:15.70]You should see Haley.
[35:16.58]He can help you out.
[35:28.82]You're going to get in trouble with the Aquila majors, I'll tell you.
[35:31.75]Look, go on, talk to Haley.
[35:33.09]He's the wise man.
[35:34.63]He used to be a guard, but he turned over to the good side.
[35:37.05]Okay.
[35:45.67]Everyone has a name?
[35:46.63]Boy, there's Haley.
[35:50.12]There's Red.
[35:52.10]I'm looking for the... Looks like a way out.
[35:57.99]We got a link here.
[35:59.73]There's some link spam here.
[36:07.21]You're streaming the Chronicles of Riddick ass.
[36:11.08]I mean, that's not that funny.
[36:12.82]That's not that funny.
[36:14.40]If I'm going to get a -2 for my Disney World restaurant bit, then that's a -2 for the word asses in the title.
[36:21.63]Come on, Gwen.
[36:25.64]Bugger.
[36:30.93]I got him.
[36:31.37]I actually hit him.
[36:31.93]I didn't think that was even... Nobody even saw.
[36:35.61]Nobody saw me do that.
[36:44.65]Shit.
[36:47.78]Wait, they thought he did it.
[36:49.82]He did it.
[36:50.16]That guy did it.
[36:52.78]Pick him back to his cell.
[37:01.34]Yeah, come on, dude.
[37:03.06]Give it a rest.
[37:07.74]Oh, I'm about to impress everybody at the prison right now.
[37:21.15]Have you ever seen anybody do that for you in your whole life?
[37:23.23]No.
[37:30.05]I want this guy fired for heaven.
[37:40.91]Trying to do a voice like mine.
[37:42.47]I'm the only one that has a low, gravelly voice.
[37:45.01]Get rid of that guy.
[37:48.03]What do you want me to do?
[37:49.93]What's with the links today?
[37:52.07]Dickass gameplay.
[37:53.29]Cool.
[37:53.53]Yeah, you cropped it.
[37:58.81]I knew you'd come eventually.
[38:01.49]Listen, Riddick.
[38:03.23]Rust pulls all the strings in this block.
[38:06.37]Personally, I don't much care for that.
[38:09.11]He's a thorn in my side.
[38:12.07]Child humor.
[38:13.89]Remove the thorn.
[38:16.05]Get Rust.
[38:16.85]Alright, so I have to... You give me a list of people I have to... You are in violation.
[38:24.64]Strange.
[38:29.04]Wait, they electrocuted him and it electrocuted me.
[38:33.87]I was standing on his body.
[38:35.33]I was a conductor.
[38:40.07]Alright, let's go.
[38:40.69]Who did he say to kill?
[38:42.63]I wasn't even listening.
[38:44.26]Yes, I was.
[38:46.00]Okay.
[38:48.98]Matson promised he'd put a shiv for you in his bunk.
[38:51.34]Go to cell A40 and get the shiv.
[38:53.30]Don't give me a knife.
[38:56.74]Don't give me a knife.
[38:57.84]Don't do that.
[38:58.60]I'll never get out of this tutorial.
[38:59.86]It's not going to happen if I get a knife and I'm not going to be able to leave.
[39:03.82]Don't give me this.
[39:06.48]In the toilet?
[39:11.22]Hey.
[39:11.98]What?
[39:12.56]Oh.
[39:13.42]You guys want to fight?
[39:15.74]Do you?
[39:16.10]Or is this like a dialog thing?
[39:18.24]What do you want to talk about?
[39:19.16]Alright, I'll do it too.
[39:23.06]I'm new here.
[39:24.58]And... I think they want to fight.
[39:27.88]Do they?
[39:28.16]I don't... Maybe... Woah, I just parried that guy.
[39:55.94]Okay, okay, hold on.
[40:00.47]Flush him.
[40:00.91]Alright, I'm gonna flush him.
[40:01.69]I'm gonna try to flush him.
[40:04.01]He's too big.
[40:04.73]I can't flush him.
[40:06.63]Alright, where's the knife?
[40:22.96]There's supposed to be a knife in here.
[40:24.64]Oh, no, he lied to me.
[40:25.76]There's no knife in here.
[40:26.62]He lied to me.
[40:27.30]He said there was a knife in here so I could come in and get beat up and potentially fucking killed.
[40:33.45]Hmm.
[40:37.17]Mm-hmm.
[40:38.15]Go see what he has to say about it.
[40:39.55]Alright, let's go get him.
[40:44.88]Where are you?
[40:50.11]Is that in the courtyard?
[40:51.13]Is there Sprint?
[40:55.42]It's Barber.
[40:57.12]That's Jimbo.
[41:00.56]This is Shabby.
[41:02.92]This is Michaels.
[41:08.93]Okay.
[41:10.31]Okay.
[41:18.41]-2, joke.
[41:19.27]Ignoring the link.
[41:23.86]I'm in the middle of something!
[41:28.14]Where is- No, not Jack.
[41:29.87]He's up here.
[41:31.87]He's the right here, isn't he?
[41:33.85]Oh, that's red.
[41:37.49]Yeah, later.
[41:40.28]I want it now.
[41:40.88]This one guy's just like, I'm gonna hear everything!
[42:06.93]Let me set things straight.
[42:08.99]I'll bring that shift to your cell.
[42:11.78]Just go there and wait.
[42:12.78]Are there three guys here?
[42:16.30]Yeah.
[42:16.98]Yeah, that's what's happening, Haley.
[42:19.16]It's alright.
[42:19.74]I'm still going to do the thing for you.
[42:21.46]Get Rust, and I'll help you.
[42:24.89]Go to your cell and wait for me.
[42:26.71]Better not be lying to me.
[42:33.01]Remember, this is the last time.
[42:34.25]Alright, it's the last link of this- Link cooldown is going into effect after I click this.
[42:40.50]It's just Homer Simpson, like, shoes.
[42:43.52]Homer Simpson, like, mask sock feet things, right?
[42:46.96]Isn't that, like, the kiosk at the mall?
[42:48.38]They have, like, goofy fucking slippers to put on?
[42:50.14]That's cool.
[42:50.92]Alright, go back to my cell.
[43:00.67]Which cell is mine?
[43:01.49]I don't even remember.
[43:03.23]I don't know.
[43:03.51]What cell is mine?
[43:04.37]This is a bad prison if I don't even know where I go.
[43:06.28]I don't know what cell is mine.
[43:07.84]I forget.
[43:08.20]A34?
[43:08.38]This one.
[43:08.88]Alright.
[43:11.12]Where is he?
[43:16.86]I got to see if you wanted Riddick.
[43:19.00]What the F do you think you're doing, Madsen?
[43:21.68]You're dealing without my approval.
[43:23.68]You're in my cell.
[43:25.36]You need a blade.
[43:26.50]You come to me.
[43:27.52]I said...
[43:31.51]Who's this?
[43:32.31]Oh, it's one of the guards.
[44:13.38]This dude's in like a Tony Hawk creative character outfit.
[44:15.88]Hey!
[44:16.18]That's my friend!
[44:16.78]What'd he just do?
[44:17.66]Why did blood come out of him?
[44:19.24]That was a ketchup packet that he spread on the wall.
[44:25.64]This is actors, I'm telling you.
[44:45.74]This is not very good guard work.
[44:56.93]We could have had like three or four opportunities just to grab the gun out of his hand.
[45:00.11]Like, come on.
[45:00.55]You can't get that close.
[45:01.55]You alright?
[45:16.49]Get out of my... Get out of my wall.
[45:18.14]Get away from me.
[45:23.42]Rust is waiting for you in the Achilles block.
[45:26.28]He won't stop till you're dead, so you better find a weapon.
[45:30.08]Warmon can help.
[45:32.44]Okay.
[45:34.56]I... This is just go around and find the one person that's actually going to help me.
[45:39.92]Okay.
[45:41.31]Get a weapon.
[45:44.44]Haley won't talk to me unless I get rid of Rust.
[45:47.56]And then Molina seems to have messed up Shabby up real bad.
[45:51.26]Find and kill Molina.
[45:52.72]Alright.
[45:53.96]Let's just go to the... I need a weapon.
[46:07.63]Hey.
[46:09.44]Oh.
[46:09.54]Oh.
[46:23.99]Wait, what if he doubles the money?
[46:25.63]I don't know what you're after, okay?
[46:27.91]But Haley knows how things work here.
[46:30.49]Check the courtyard.
[46:31.70]No, he didn't say like, I'll double the money that you were going to get from that guy.
[46:35.00]No, sorry.
[46:35.66]You didn't do the double the money meme.
[46:48.30]How do I do this without getting attention?
[46:53.56]Trope?
[46:54.04]Cliche?
[46:54.82]Yeah, whatever.
[47:17.63]Did I get him?
[47:39.68]I can't even pick his body up.
[47:44.13]Hey!
[47:53.43]Hit him one more time?
[47:54.21]I didn't want to do it in the open.
[47:56.03]Wait, is he gonna remember that?
[48:00.31]Why did he crawl out of my cell?
[48:02.89]He crawled in that much time to here.
[48:05.49]Does anybody give this guy some medicine?
[48:07.92]Wait, is he gonna be there?
[48:08.78]He's not gonna still be here, right?
[48:12.76]Does he remember that I did that?
[48:13.92]Does this game have, like, memories?
[48:15.72]What?
[48:23.07]He's dead?
[48:23.65]Alright, where's, um... Where's the guy that I have to turn this into?
[48:33.30]Who wanted me to do this?
[48:38.39]It was shabby.
[48:39.75]Oh, now Molina's gone.
[48:40.97]Go and get your... Oh, alright.
[48:46.31]What's up?
[48:47.89]What is it?
[48:55.96]What is it?
[48:56.54]He didn't give me anything.
[48:57.48]What do you mean, this is for you?
[48:58.64]He didn't give me anything.
[49:01.22]Thanks for wasting Molina, man.
[49:07.26]See, wait.
[49:07.90]The unofficial and universal currency.
[49:09.70]You currently have five UD.
[49:11.18]Secret code.
[49:13.04]This is a four-digit security code.
[49:14.46]It opens a locked door somewhere.
[49:15.86]Probably inside the infirmary.
[49:19.12]Oh.
[49:22.08]Alright.
[49:24.81]Thanks, dude.
[49:29.23]Alright, now let's go into the yard here.
[49:31.47]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if in like 40 minutes this guy's up here on the ground still.
[49:39.01]Russ will kill you unless you join him.
[49:41.23]I'd like to see him try, Jimbo.
[49:43.73]I'd like to see him try.
[49:54.70]Ah, new fish in the tank.
[49:57.64]How do you like it here, Renig?
[49:59.52]I don't.
[50:00.58]Name's Red.
[50:02.73]Tell me, Riddick.
[50:04.69]How did it feel when you killed your first wife?
[50:06.93]Oh, you mean Molina?
[50:07.74]That's between me and him.
[50:09.68]In Butcher Bay, some men kill for nothing but pleasure.
[50:14.62]You know, there are worse reasons.
[50:17.90]Some, like Rust, I'd be happy to see gone.
[50:23.57]Alright, so Red wants Rust gone.
[50:25.19]Rust wants Hayley gone.
[50:26.25]Hayley wants Molina gone.
[50:27.37]Molina wants Rust gone.
[50:33.78]This is like a long math problem.
[50:36.70]Unlike my SATs.
[50:39.15]Okay, Rust is waiting for you in Akela territory.
[50:42.35]I don't have a weapon yet, though.
[50:46.09]Haley won't talk unless you get rid of Rust.
[50:47.45]Alright, well, where is he?
[50:52.67]Alright, well, where is he?
[50:55.01]Which one is he?
[50:55.59]That's Booger.
[50:56.81]Okay, well, I punched him.
[51:02.26]Can I climb this?
[51:03.00]Can I, like, grab onto this?
[51:05.83]We're gonna go this way.
[51:19.89]Wow, man.
[51:20.53]Okay, yeah.
[51:21.09]Let's see if we can find somebody.
[51:23.63]Oh, here we go.
[51:24.07]This is the territory.
[51:29.73]Wait, does it don't come here until I had a weapon?
[51:31.47]Alright, yeah.
[51:33.24]Wait, I don't want to be here, do I?
[51:45.21]You got two weapons.
[51:46.19]Lefty and righty.
[51:49.81]Alright, we're looking for Wom-Man.
[51:56.39]Red.
[51:57.11]Hayley.
[52:02.05]Jack.
[52:03.48]Yeah, he's waiting.
[52:06.15]Everyone just keeps tipping me off on this.
[52:09.29]Do you think this guy's just sitting there with a knife, just holding it, standing around the alley?
[52:12.73]And everyone has told me that he's going to try to kill me.
[52:14.55]I think it's time for a new strategy.
[52:16.95]I killed him.
[52:20.83]So... Alright.
[52:21.11]No!
[52:21.21]No!
[52:33.76]Extra content.
[52:34.56]Large alien is now available in the extra content menu.
[52:39.16]Take it easy, Riddick.
[52:42.14]Wait.
[52:43.98]Wait, wait, wait.
[52:44.49]Is this a weapon?
[52:47.15]Knuckle duster?
[52:48.03]Okay.
[52:53.15]That's a weapon.
[52:55.47]Thanks.
[52:55.95]Alright, let's go.
[53:05.45]Alright, we're going to go.
[53:06.23]Rust is waiting for me.
[53:07.05]He's going to kill me.
[53:11.92]I know this now.
[53:12.74]I'm going to go to this territory.
[53:13.90]I'm going to find out what's going on over here.
[53:26.74]Okay, let's get him.
[53:27.90]This is Aquila territory.
[53:29.24]You don't belong here.
[53:32.57]He's here.
[53:33.59]Riddick is here.
[53:34.65]No, he's not.
[53:44.00]Walk it.
[53:46.58]There it is.
[53:49.34]Alright, you, let's go.
[53:54.38]Was that, who, which one of you is Rust?
[53:59.16]We're going to kill you.
[54:15.91]Smash his head in.
[54:16.63]Good.
[54:16.87]Oh, is that money?
[54:19.45]Ooh, I got two knuckle dusters.
[54:26.14]And cigarettes.
[54:27.86]The Riddick team unlocked.
[54:29.18]Cool.
[54:33.20]Is it a healing station?
[54:41.56]That shit is dangerously close to the eyes.
[54:43.71]Wait, wait, wait.
[54:45.51]I probably should hide these guys, right?
[54:54.24]Whatever.
[54:54.58]No, I wanted to... Come on!
[55:04.67]Taste this!
[55:10.76]Okay.
[55:11.38]It was a little scary, but it didn't do anything.
[55:18.68]If you were this guy, you'd probably be like, oh shit, it didn't work.
[55:22.04]It was supposed to explode, Reddick!
[55:25.62]I'm sorry!
[55:26.21]I want that knife.
[55:31.15]Walk it!
[55:31.57]There we go.
[55:53.45]Oh, this is green sludge on the ground.
[55:54.83]That's probably acid.
[55:55.85]I'm gonna snap your head off and piss down your neck.
[56:09.40]Oh, shit.
[56:09.90]That was... I just, like, slashed him.
[56:16.58]I don't know how I stabbed him.
[56:22.77]I thought I killed him.
[56:23.97]Damn it.
[56:24.43]I thought I died from that.
[56:28.57]Oh, you want to have an old-fashioned knife fight, do you?
[56:30.75]Come on.
[56:37.03]Oh, sorry about that.
[56:39.82]Can I have two knives?
[56:44.48]Oh, no.
[56:46.26]This one's cooler.
[56:53.30]I wish you could do a weld.
[56:54.10]Somebody there.
[57:02.00]Get ready to die, Riddick.
[57:03.92]Wait, I know this guy.
[57:05.19]This guy was in a cutscene.
[57:26.70]Where is the principal?
[57:28.40]Where's the guard?
[57:33.90]I'm dead.
[57:36.84]Where's the warden?
[57:37.58]Where's the warden?
[57:38.48]Come on, do it.
[58:04.68]I'm trying.
[58:06.80]It's harder than you think.
[58:16.59]Get away from me.
[58:20.00]Can I parry this guy?
[58:20.96]I don't think I can parry him.
[58:25.90]Where is he?
[58:26.18]Where is he?
[58:31.23]You can't parry him, he's a boss fight.
[58:33.13]Oh.
[58:34.49]Well, then I'll just kill him.
[58:52.88]So fucking glad I'm not playing this on hard.
[59:04.52]Where you going?
[59:06.24]What is he doing?
[59:14.25]Switching it up.
[59:27.60]I'm in my menu and he knows he's coming at me.
[59:49.42]He's so good.
[59:50.50]Why is he so good?
[59:54.38]Dude, why do I only have one stab?
[59:59.10]Just spam.
[60:00.31]I can't- he's gonna kill me.
[60:04.71]Why do I only have this one, like, lunging stab?
[60:07.53]Alright, I'm just gonna fucking spam, alright?
[60:09.45]I'll do it, fine.
[60:28.84]Riddick!
[60:33.72]Why is this taking so long?
[60:43.42]Holy shit.
[60:47.36]Huh?
[60:56.93]Hey, just out of curiosity, Riddick, how many tries did that take you?
[61:08.12]Looks like I need a new rooster.
[61:10.22]Let's say four.
[61:11.34]They respect you now, Riddick.
[61:13.38]I can make things easier.
[61:15.82]Say something.
[61:21.17]Take that as a no.
[61:23.19]Saying no to me is not the kind of mistake you want to make.
[61:27.64]Okay.
[61:30.57]Wait, wait, wait.
[61:31.33]What's going on right now?
[61:32.35]Am I supposed to be hiding from these?
[61:33.71]What do they have?
[61:34.23]Laser eyes.
[61:34.75]I don't know.
[61:38.90]What do we do?
[61:42.90]By the way, this is my kill.
[61:57.44]I wish you could throw.
[62:03.86]Shit!
[62:04.10]He fucking looked at me!
[62:05.06]I was trying to break his neck and run.
[62:08.66]I hate when games give me freedom.
[62:13.48]Because I can die.
[62:14.30]I just don't stop.
[62:16.46]Alright, I'm just leaving.
[62:17.48]Fine.
[62:18.26]There we go.
[62:18.66]Goodbye.
[62:18.96]Hey.
[62:27.07]What?
[62:28.50]Oh.
[62:29.28]He gave me cigarettes.
[62:33.65]Am I a bad guy now?
[62:34.63]Do people think I'm bad?
[62:57.96]Okay, where do I go?
[63:04.40]Rust is gone, you should go talk to Haley, okay.
[63:18.41]Dude, I think you got him.
[63:23.47]Oh shit!
[63:34.68]Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
[63:40.42]I gotta go.
[63:48.16]That was something, man.
[63:50.18]Hey, thanks.
[63:57.78]No, don't break everybody's neck.
[63:59.22]I need NPCs.
[63:59.76]This is gonna be like Dark Souls, where if you kill all the NPCs, like, the game sucks.
[64:03.30]I'm done.
[64:09.86]Get the gun?
[64:10.44]I can't get the gun.
[64:11.00]The gun electrocuted my... It said unauthorized access.
[64:14.48]I can't get the gun.
[64:15.32]It's locked.
[64:15.78]Break this guy's neck.
[64:28.81]No.
[64:29.27]I can't kill everybody.
[64:31.91]I'm sorry.
[64:32.49]I can't.
[64:37.35]I didn't do that.
[64:39.42]Right?
[64:39.58]I didn't do that.
[64:48.85]You did.
[64:49.35]I did not do that.
[64:54.95]He forgot.
[64:55.61]He blacked out and did it.
[64:59.57]Alright, where's my reward?
[65:01.91]Where are you?
[65:02.43]Hey.
[65:06.31]Raise some hell.
[65:23.54]If you manage to stay alive, there's supposed to be a way into Pigsville from down there.
[65:29.28]But, it's never been done.
[65:31.92]I like a challenge.
[65:33.82]Well, then, Pigsville's your place.
[65:36.52]Get to the space board hangers.
[65:38.48]Space?
[65:38.68]Does it?
[65:38.94]You can get to the space board hangers from there.
[65:41.86]But, you would need a rifle.
[65:44.32]And they're all DNA encoded.
[65:47.11]Yeah.
[65:48.15]And you'll fry if you touch them.
[65:49.48]Because that's why I've been dying.
[65:50.70]And the DNA data bank is deep inside the mainframe area.
[65:54.44]Past the infirmary.
[65:55.86]So I just walk in.
[65:57.88]Huh?
[65:58.64]No.
[65:59.40]You gotta crawl.
[66:01.36]There is a passage from the infirmary that I think connects to the mainframe.
[66:05.91]Oh.
[66:06.79]And if you want to get through the infirmary gates, there's this hack.
[66:10.79]Name's Boulder.
[66:12.37]He owes me 150.
[66:12.87]150?
[66:12.89]Talk to him.
[66:13.55]Split it with you.
[66:19.69]No.
[66:20.81]I almost did it.
[66:25.10]Alright.
[66:25.68]Talk to Boulder to get into the infirmary.
[66:28.52]I have to start to remember names.
[66:32.85]Boulder?
[66:34.77]It was Booger.
[66:36.81]Where's Boulder?
[66:37.77]Boulder.
[66:46.28]Boulder.
[66:48.23]I don't know where I can find Boulder.
[66:54.16]Do the Vin Diesel voice.
[66:55.38]Funny man.
[66:57.42]You must have just... I've done it like five times.
[67:00.18]Fine.
[67:03.58]That's Snape.
[67:04.06]Let me change it.
[67:07.32]I can't do it anymore.
[67:08.26]It's Snape again.
[67:11.47]I can't do it.
[67:13.33]It's always going to be Snape.
[67:14.45]I have to delete that from my mind.
[67:18.08]Let's go out for a bit.
[67:18.88]No.
[67:19.12]We'll see you in an hour.
[67:20.91]Just stay for an hour.
[67:21.59]You'll figure it out.
[67:22.11]Okay.
[67:35.73]I can't.
[67:37.17]I can't.
[67:38.57]Alright, where's Boulder?
[67:40.09]Hey.
[67:41.17]Haley says you owe him.
[67:43.11]He should get that money from you, Riddick.
[67:45.86]You screwed my bet on Russ when you got him.
[67:47.74]I'll figure it out.
[67:48.24]Yeah, I don't know what that means.
[67:49.10]You screwed yourself by betting against me.
[67:52.74]Now, the infirmary.
[67:54.40]Everyone looks like a thumb with a face.
[67:55.59]Man, you look like how I feel, like shit.
[67:58.03]Okay, go on through.
[67:59.45]Hurry up.
[68:07.70]Thanks, dude.
[68:08.18]Appreciate it.
[68:17.79]Open!
[68:17.93]Alright, now where do I have to go?
[68:20.09]Do I have to find a necklace that's going to give me powers?
[68:24.27]What do I do?
[68:25.41]I don't... I'm not going to do it.
[68:30.92]Something's going on in here.
[68:33.68]Uh-oh.
[68:35.15]That sounds like a guy that never gets to say swears in his parents' house.
[68:43.14]Hey!
[68:44.48]I'm sta- I'm waiting for the doctor!
[68:47.34]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[68:53.21]For all you know, I could be the doctor, okay?
[68:57.83]Get outta here.
[68:59.45]What's going on with this guy?
[69:00.95]Stomach cramps?
[69:02.61]I'll take care of that.
[69:18.15]Jesus Christ!
[69:19.67]He just lit that guy up!
[69:21.17]He lit that guy up.
[69:22.13]Alright, I feel bad now.
[69:23.83]I feel bad now.
[69:24.49]That guy ate all the bullets.
[69:29.36]I feel terrible.
[69:31.30]That guy inhaled all of them.
[69:35.42]Okay.
[69:37.23]Okay, I have to address this.
[69:45.97]Somebody went, snap fingers, snap fingers.
[69:47.95]Hey, funny guy, do the funny voices.
[69:50.11]Like, shpee, get out of here.
[70:01.85]No!
[70:13.05]Where's this doctor?
[70:14.63]Don't come over here.
[70:15.39]You saw me do that, but I didn't... you're... Wait, what?
[70:24.73]What?
[70:36.68]I think the door came down and crushed me.
[70:42.88]Alright, I need to obviously distract them somehow.
[70:46.88]The doctor's never coming.
[70:48.04]Or am I just so impatient that I can't do this?
[70:51.62]What does the doctor look like?
[71:01.10]Whoa, this guy doesn't have a gun.
[71:03.33]Is this the doctor?
[71:07.24]Alright, don't break the doctor's neck when he opens the door.
[71:08.88]Don't break the doctor's neck when he opens the door.
[71:10.34]Don't break the doctor's neck when he opens the door.
[71:12.00]He's gonna write it on the chalkboard a thousand times.
[71:14.40]Ugh.
[71:45.72]I mean this is dark.
[71:57.17]I'm in the dark, he can't see anything.
[72:06.20]What's going on?
[72:08.87]What is happening?
[72:09.47]I think that guy's stuck in the door.
[72:13.67]Okay.
[72:24.69]Okay.
[72:36.62]Alright.
[72:37.58]Now.
[72:37.82]I can't pick these up.
[72:49.99]Oh, damn.
[72:57.80]Security code.
[72:58.52]Put him down, put him down, put him down.
[73:04.94]Alright, I got the security code.
[73:12.84]That means I can leave.
[73:28.14]Got it.
[73:33.48]What?
[73:34.16]What?
[73:35.72]Why are you just standing there?
[73:37.28]Die!
[73:39.51]Die!
[73:54.92]Do you have a code on you?
[73:59.05]That was the doctor.
[73:59.91]I see.
[74:00.67]Okay.
[74:04.03]What's in here?
[74:06.07]Some type of weird laboratory machine.
[74:08.25]Do I use it?
[74:16.40]Use health station.
[74:17.64]Oh.
[74:19.26]This looks like that thing at Dave and Buster's that you ride the rollercoaster.
[74:25.29]Why is that still in Dave and Buster's, by the way?
[74:29.13]That shit was really, really interesting probably 15 years ago.
[74:31.85]Like, that was... This is VR now.
[74:34.21]You don't have to watch, like, a TV screen while your seat moves.
[74:36.37]I don't even need the health.
[74:50.65]I should be sneaking around way more often.
[74:52.83]Can I pick this up?
[74:53.39]This looks like an exploding barrel.
[74:57.36]He's going to turn the corner and shoot the exploding barrel, isn't he?
[75:06.63]Now I'm up top.
[75:07.29]Alright, so is anybody up here?
[75:11.73]Oh.
[75:14.43]Oh, shit.
[75:14.87]Okay.
[75:15.47]Let's wait for him to walk by.
[75:21.63]Is it...
[75:26.23]Permanent health upgrade?
[75:27.47]Are you serious?
[75:47.87]How do I use it?
[75:49.19]Oh.
[75:55.62]Alright, do I want to pick skiing, roller coaster, or I'm in an airplane?
[76:05.21]That was alright.
[76:07.11]You're way too close.
[76:08.95]You're too close.
[76:25.59]Yup.
[76:26.25]Don't do that again.
[76:27.01]Don't do that again or you're gonna be real sorry.
[76:30.07]Alright, this is a save point so I can- doesn't matter.
[76:42.76]Service hatch, but wait.
[76:44.61]Oh.
[76:46.01]Gun, gun.
[76:47.35]I can't pick up the gun, the DNA.
[76:49.45]Look, how- look, guys, look.
[76:51.45]Ready?
[76:52.85]Look.
[76:54.09]I can't.
[76:55.15]I can't.
[76:55.99]I can't.
[76:56.89]I can't.
[76:58.85]I cannot pick up the gun.
[77:00.05]I don't have the DNA qualification.
[77:02.25]Whatever the hell it is.
[77:03.21]Look.
[77:04.69]Look at.
[77:06.16]Look.
[77:08.00]See?
[77:08.30]Oh.
[77:17.80]I love it.
[77:21.94]What?
[77:22.52]Oh.
[77:23.12]Is he gonna climb in the hatch?
[77:28.94]Are they looking for me?
[77:38.69]Like, can I just jump on people?
[77:44.69]Where is this guy?

[79:20.08]Can I dump him down there?
[79:27.05]No.
[79:27.25]Okay.
[79:29.25]Well, I can stand up now.
[79:31.17]Where's the key code?
[79:34.78]Grab the gun.
[79:35.42]You can't get the gun.
[79:37.76]There's no gun.
[79:38.54]Um... And who's killed me?
[79:41.06]Gotta stay in the dark.
[80:06.43]Security code?
[80:06.91]Alright.
[80:08.95]I think somebody walked by.
[80:10.01]We'll wait for them.
[80:14.51]Where is he?
[80:20.39]Alright, now wait.
[80:30.02]No, no.
[80:30.28]Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide.
[80:33.06]Somebody comes from the other angle.
[80:36.06]Yep.
[80:36.72]Who's that?
[80:37.04]Somebody's pointing at me.
[80:39.38]Wait.
[80:40.52]That's the spotlight.
[80:41.10]It's on me.
[80:49.54]Alright.
[80:49.76]Does this guy have tranquilizer darts?
[80:53.52]I said it again instantly.
[80:55.58]Alright.
[80:55.86]You know what?
[80:56.40]Fuck it.
[80:56.90]Gotta stay in the dark.
[81:03.50]No, I get it.
[81:03.98]This is a stealth part of the mission where you instantly die.
[81:06.56]I get it.
[81:12.99]Why did he turn around?
[81:21.39]What?
[81:27.46]Okay, can... Does the spotlight move...
[81:31.92]Why does the spotlight move?
[81:32.94]It just stays right there.
[81:33.88]Access granted.
[81:37.63]Eat this, prisoner.
[81:42.51]You're fucking pathetic.
[81:58.78]Alright, let... Eat?
[82:00.56]Eat what?
[82:01.40]I don't have anything to eat.
[82:02.92]How many eat?
[82:04.16]I made it.
[82:04.65]I'm good.
[82:04.99]Eat a McDLT.
[82:06.15]I would right now.
[82:27.32]The mainframe security will be tight.
[82:31.90]Sure, it will.
[82:32.46]I like a challenge.
[82:38.77]That's the kind of voice that you use when it's like one o'clock in the morning and you're talking to like a significant other or like, you know, person of interest.
[82:47.96]Like we get late at night and you just like talking like that, like, what's up?
[82:51.20]Yeah, just hanging out, just chilling.
[82:54.28]I don't know why we people do that.
[82:56.36]It's just to sound, like, sexy?
[82:59.70]I don't know what it means.
[83:01.10]Why do we do that?
[83:05.08]Like, I very clearly could just put my head up and be like, yeah, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[83:07.42]I don't think I'm supposed to be down here.
[83:16.89]How does this guy have a... Give me the DNA sample!
[83:22.80]Wait, he didn't have it on him?
[83:23.76]Who is this random engineer with like a staff?
[83:33.29]Oh, I didn't... Give me that.
[83:37.05]I want your staff.
[83:40.30]Hold on, I can use guns now.
[83:43.78]Oh, yeah, they do.
[83:56.81]I never had any gun training in my life I've lost the cqc training though god I'm so stupid
[84:22.91]Alright.
[84:24.03]Well, I didn't know they were going to pour in here.
[84:27.48]Alright.
[84:30.36]Bring it on.
[84:30.78]Okay.
[84:52.83]Give me all the ammo.
[84:53.93]How do I reload the gun?
[84:57.61]Wait, gun.
[84:59.41]Oh, cool.
[84:59.91]I got gun.
[85:03.95]Gun.
[85:08.52]Grenade!
[85:09.86]What?
[85:14.58]Oh, I'm dead.
[85:15.34]Everything under control?
[85:16.36]Pretty sure some fuckers running around here.
[85:19.40]I'm gonna get them.
[85:20.49]Well, nothing here.
[85:31.24]Didn't come in?
[85:31.90]Why do they... Oh, that's... It's supposed to blow up the wall.
[85:36.49]Oh, health station.
[85:50.20]Debris?
[85:53.17]Oh.
[85:54.65]Was he on a Burmese?
[86:00.63]You can't even see me down here, dude.
[86:10.44]You can't.
[86:11.06]He didn't see me down there.
[86:11.98]That's ridiculous.
[86:13.34]You got a key code on it?
[86:14.20]Shotgun.
[86:14.76]Better.
[86:15.60]I'll take the shotgun over anything else.
[86:16.94]My favorite weapon.
[86:26.48]Wait, was this a... Oh, I thought this was a vent to go into.
[86:28.76]Do I have to destroy this?
[86:30.90]I'm like trying to crawl in it.
[86:32.54]What do I have to do with this?
[86:49.29]Did I miss something?
[86:49.99]Need any help?
[86:54.13]Oh.
[87:10.62]I'm just going to climb, I guess.
[87:11.72]Yeah.
[87:12.28]Okay.
[87:12.60]Climb.
[87:14.10]I just said open service panel.
[87:15.44]I didn't know what it was supposed to mean.
[87:18.82]No.
[87:19.64]Vin Diesel, get it back up there.
[87:25.05]Wait.
[87:25.31]I might be able to jump on top of people.
[87:26.43]This might be fun.
[87:33.38]Better go that way.
[87:33.92]But wait.
[87:34.30]Can I jump on somebody's head?
[87:37.92]No.
[87:38.26]Alright.
[87:38.42]We'll just go from here to there.

[88:15.09]Zed, this is my opportunity to do it.
[88:22.68]What?
[88:27.96]Why didn't that work?
[88:31.70]Didn't it say you could jump on people's heads?
[88:36.96]I feel like I was lied to.
[88:49.00]How did you have- There's no fucking way you have more reaction time than me on that one.
[88:56.37]Wait, I get to try this again.
[89:19.10]Melee weapon.
[89:21.20]Alright, walk down here.
[89:28.90]Come on, man.
[89:29.30]Let's go.
[89:33.01]Go walk over here, both of you idiots.
[89:50.29]He's being body blocked.
[89:51.53]He wants... He so badly wants to go home.
[89:56.07]He desperately wants to keep looking, but this guy keeps getting in his way.
[89:59.73]Just let him do an investigation.
[90:03.70]I didn't mean to jump through.
[90:08.00]I'm gonna die.
[90:08.80]I'm dead.
[90:21.23]God damn it.
[90:25.55]Well, they wouldn't walk.
[90:26.97]They couldn't get the guy to move.
[90:32.63]There's a heal right there.
[90:35.00]Just got to kill this guy.
[90:36.02]1, 2, 3.
[90:39.54]What?
[90:39.82]I hear another guy shooting.
[90:40.54]I think it's a pre-fire.
[90:46.48]Where is he?
[90:50.33]Oh, did I get him?
[90:51.15]I don't know.
[90:52.07]Did I get him?
[90:53.31]I still hear the Metal Gear Solid music.
[90:59.40]He's up.
[90:59.88]I don't know.
[91:04.68]Where is he?
[91:05.00]I don't know where he is.
[91:18.92]Okay, I see him, but how the fuck am I going to aim over there?
[91:21.34]I have an idea.
[91:37.90]How are they seeing me?
[91:39.00]What?
[91:41.48]Where am I?
[91:56.53]Where?
[91:57.23]He's trying to shoot me through the grate.
[91:59.20]He's trying to shoot me through the grate.
[92:00.20]I gotta take it fast.
[92:02.02]What would Riddick do?
[92:08.69]What a shitty movie.
[92:21.25]This is how I used to play paintball when I was a kid.
[92:23.90]I was so scared I so badly didn't want to get hit.
[92:27.24]That the whole game I would just stay in one spot and just kind of peek out and go... And then just immediately get back in.
[92:32.98]Am I dead?
[92:46.56]Okay, you can connect again, please.
[92:54.07]Thank you.
[92:54.69]Okay.
[93:06.48]I can't shoot him through the grate, but he can shoot me through the grate.
[93:17.87]I'm not fucking around anymore.
[93:18.89]I'm done.
[93:20.03]I'm done with this bullshit.
[93:21.09]I'm just fucking lighting up.
[93:23.29]I'm just lighting them up.
[93:24.63]You know what I mean?
[93:28.29]I fell through the grate.
[93:39.75]Come on.
[93:39.99]Let's go.
[93:40.33]Get it.
[93:40.69]Show it.
[93:41.01]Go ahead.
[93:41.55]Go on.
[93:55.30]Dude, I'm supposed to be able to see in the dark.
[93:57.58]Okay?
[93:58.84]But how does this make any sense?
[94:00.28]Riddick's supposed to be able to see in the dark.
[94:17.72]Not yet.
[94:19.50]Who said that?
[94:22.57]That guy was blending into the environment.
[94:24.05]That guy was actually not a person.
[94:25.33]He was like a wall.
[94:26.03]Uh oh.
[94:36.68]Gas.
[94:50.07]That was easy.
[94:53.62]Did you do that for fun?
[95:00.34]Or... I don't... Okay.
[95:12.39]Wait, there's a little more gas over here.
[95:20.10]This is not open.
[95:21.00]Can I... I can't go that way.
[95:25.97]Oh, it was a way to make the wall explode.
[95:27.89]I get it.
[95:28.44]D-pad?
[95:30.24]No.
[95:50.11]I gotta get- I have to go down.
[95:51.37]I have eight bullets.
[95:58.88]What?
[96:07.83]Where did that guy go?
[96:08.85]Give me a checkpoint.
[96:24.84]Can we go back to like punching inmates and like laughing at toilets?
[96:40.34]Alright, this looks like a boss area.
[96:41.96]Alright, I'm going to use gun.
[97:00.32]Okay, thanks.
[97:02.00]Ooh, nice dodging.
[97:04.68]Oh, why am I the boss?
[97:06.02]You know what I mean?
[97:06.62]Like, that's how you would dodge the boss.
[97:08.22]I'm the boss.
[97:09.34]And he just, he's the one that's playing the game.
[97:15.15]Why did he explode?
[97:29.24]Can I leave?
[97:33.87]Hello?
[97:34.19]Everybody gone?
[97:38.87]Oh shit, this one guy.
[97:40.11]Oh my god, he's right here.
[97:41.57]Oh my god, he's gonna hit me once and I'm gonna die.
[97:44.51]Where are you?
[97:49.01]Where?
[97:49.23]There's another guy.
[97:56.83]Where's the other guy?
[97:57.35]There's another guy?
[97:58.57]Oh, oh, oh!
[98:07.74]Oh no!
[98:10.00]It's the Space Marine!
[98:11.36]This is so lame.
[98:43.95]Hold on, wait, let me reload.
[98:46.25]Why am I holding the gun like this?
[98:47.83]Oh, come on.
[98:48.49]I have to shoot him in the back?
[98:57.06]Oh.
[99:02.60]I have to get in his spot.
[99:05.28]There's the grenade.
[99:07.12]Alright, I'm going over here.
[99:08.18]I'm already almost dead.
[99:14.32]Give me the, uh... Ooh!
[99:20.36]I got him in the head.
[99:31.83]Okay, I got him.
[99:33.75]Stand still for a second.
[99:37.46]Alright, nice.
[99:41.72]Now, is there a... Oh, shit.
[99:49.39]Okay, okay.
[99:50.03]Wait, wait, wait.
[99:50.79]The health pack.
[99:52.69]He goes, hey.
[99:55.95]Oh, no.
[99:56.41]Where do I hide?
[99:56.75]I'm going to hide over here.
[99:58.61]Do I hide over here?
[99:59.21]Am I technically in the dark?
[100:14.01]I'm in the dark right now.
[100:14.87]He can't see me.
[100:20.87]Is he getting closer or further away?
[100:30.38]Destroy the lights?
[100:51.34]Where?
[100:52.08]Oh, there he is.
[100:52.76]He can't see me, right?
[100:55.50]I'm invisible.
[101:02.98]I thought I was invisible, man.
[101:05.16]Don't say anything.
[101:18.36]I got him.
[101:20.32]Holy shit, he's so easy.
[101:22.96]Oh, you just have to shoot him in the back once.
[101:26.12]Oh, okay.
[101:27.40]I think he's still in there.
[101:29.90]That would not have killed him.
[101:30.88]I think he's still in there.
[101:32.18]I think he's going to drag the body.
[101:33.64]I need a heal thing.
[101:39.97]Check the bodies.
[101:43.55]Get weapons, get ammo.
[101:50.54]Shut that thing up because it's annoying.
[101:52.28]Ooh, you can.
[101:54.63]Alright, I got ammo.
[102:00.33]Good, let's go.
[102:08.38]Lights off.
[102:08.94]Is there still a riot going on?
[102:20.13]Yeah, I can hear it.
[102:28.62]Xbox off.
[102:29.64]It's not an Xbox One.
[102:31.02]They weren't smart back then.
[102:32.28]What did that say?
[102:33.76]What did that say?
[102:34.98]I had like a prompt.
[102:36.46]What was it?
[102:50.86]You guys saw that, right?
[103:02.85]What am I turning on?
[103:10.14]What did I do?
[103:24.93]Alright, let's go.
[103:25.69]Alright, there's some... Okay.
[103:46.46]Oh, that's a turret shooting at me.
[103:57.16]Where is it?
[104:03.16]That's just a big bright light.
[104:05.12]I don't even know where it is.
[104:05.92]Is that a turret?
[104:23.65]There was a guy hiding in the shadows too.
[104:33.69]I'm telling you, more and more every day I feel like an NPC playing the game with the protagonist fighting me.
[104:40.57]Yeah, turn this on.
[104:41.27]I don't know if this does, but it does something.
[104:59.36]Let your big brother help you?
[105:00.42]No!
[105:01.40]I want to play.
[105:07.90]Switching turret settings from tranquilizing to lethal.
[105:10.50]Alright, turret down.
[105:15.62]Where's another turret?
[105:24.98]Is that a turret right there?
[105:25.76]Yep.
[105:27.74]Turn off the light.
[105:30.16]Where's the guy that's here?
[105:31.14]Oh, he's dead.
[105:35.44]Alright, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead.
[105:39.81]Where am I supposed to be going?
[105:43.03]Turn off all the lights.
[105:44.83]I need them though, because I can't see shit either.
[105:49.86]I'm just making the game harder for myself.
[105:51.52]I can't see in the dark.
[105:57.40]Is that a good guy?
[106:05.60]That's a turret!
[106:24.20]Oh.
[106:25.74]Who's who?
[106:29.50]Take your sunglasses off.
[106:37.14]Hello?
[106:38.56]Holy shit.
[106:40.38]It's behind me.
[106:47.31]What?
[106:51.59]Where is it?
[106:57.17]Is that it?
[106:57.61]I'm so confused.
[106:59.25]I was getting shot from behind.
[107:00.13]Huh?
[107:00.21]Huh?
[107:21.48]That's a shadow, fuck.
[107:22.74]Did I get him?
[107:28.82]Alright, I got him.
[107:41.58]I need tape.
[107:54.76]Where is it?
[108:01.88]I don't know where it is.
[108:03.56]Why is it super dark now?
[108:07.48]What happened?
[108:11.11]Where the fuck am I?
[108:12.87]Did I turn off the lights on my stream?
[108:15.85]Huh?
[108:16.69]Who's...
[108:24.67]I don't understand what's going on.
[108:26.97]How did I get over here?
[108:28.55]Wasn't somebody over here?
[108:29.35]There was a guy here.
[108:31.95]Where's my gun?
[108:33.15]What happened?
[108:34.62]I don't... Did I do it?
[108:42.80]Oh, shit.
[108:43.44]Get that light off.
[108:51.02]Get this light off.
[109:01.84]Turn that light off.
[109:02.50]Oh wait, that's outside.
[109:03.26]You can't do that.
[109:04.38]Turn this one off.
[109:08.72]Ah!
[109:08.80]It was a fucking turret.
[109:25.78]Of course it was.
[109:26.42]Of course it was.
[109:31.39]Alright, did I get the heal?
[109:32.65]I have the heal.
[109:35.03]Alright, let's go.
[109:35.63]Wait, turn the valve.
[109:41.95]Still don't even know what this does.
[109:42.95]I don't instantly lose.
[109:47.24]Three bars.
[109:50.98]I didn't do anything.
[109:55.90]Switching turret settings from tranquilizing to lethal.
[110:12.24]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[110:14.75]Oh, it's dead.
[110:15.25]Okay.
[110:20.55]I got full health.
[110:21.15]Good.
[110:28.25]Fuck you.
[110:40.95]Okay, I got it.
[110:49.02]Look at my health, man.
[110:50.23]Oh my god.
[110:51.93]You guys want me to play hard?
[110:54.89]No.
[110:58.33]I shot that guy like four times.
[111:17.77]I still can't figure out what's happening to that guy.
[111:23.41]This dude just explodes.
[111:24.57]Where is it?
[111:25.09]Right here?
[111:46.14]Oh, I got it.
[111:46.52]Good job.
[111:49.82]Alright, don't let this guy kill me.
[111:51.54]He doesn't even know where I am.
[111:59.87]Holy shit!
[112:08.56]Wait, that's a speaker.
[112:09.38]It's over here.
[112:23.88]Oh!
[112:25.34]Why did I just panic?
[112:35.05]Alright, I don't want to visit.
[112:42.52]Where's the turret?
[112:43.16]I know there's one over here somewhere, isn't there?
[112:49.40]Wait, there's a guy.
[112:49.92]Alright, hold on.
[112:50.66]Wait for the guy.
[112:54.81]Wait, it's an explosive.
[112:56.91]Is that an explosive?
[112:58.37]It's not an explosive.
[113:03.17]Shit, I thought it was a barrel.
[113:05.96]Those bullets came from behind me.
[113:08.40]Why?
[113:14.48]Where is that?
[113:15.04]They hit the... There's something behind me.
[113:26.52]It ricocheted.
[113:27.28]Oh.
[113:31.73]Dude, fuck this.
[113:36.11]Okay, good.
[113:41.69]Where is it?
[113:43.86]Is that it?
[113:45.30]Yep.
[113:45.62]Okay, there's another one.
[113:52.74]That's not it?
[113:59.34]Alright, I'm gonna get the safety of the bathroom.
[114:04.78]I wish there was a heal in the bathroom.
[114:06.04]I don't know what that is, but I'm gonna take it.
[114:08.34]What is that?
[114:10.50]Ooh, a nanomed cartridge.
[114:36.14]Did I not even... You can't be fucking... How is he still hitting me?
[114:44.76]Oh god damn it.
[114:46.40]Oh god damn it.
[115:08.53]I'm just using the light.
[115:09.33]I don't care.
[115:09.81]I can't see anything.
[115:10.61]I'm using the light.
[115:13.35]It makes it worse.
[115:13.97]Never mind.
[115:17.85]Oh, shit.
[115:18.21]He's coming down the hall.
[115:18.97]Wait.
[115:19.09]He's coming down the hall.
[115:19.65]He's coming down the hall.
[115:20.33]Where is he?
[115:20.63]He's coming down the hall?
[115:23.58]Just wait for him.
[115:36.02]What the fuck?
[115:36.48]This wise guy can see me.
[115:48.84]That just actually hurt my chest.
[115:50.08]That just scared the shit out of me.
[115:52.58]Go back and heal?
[115:53.54]Oh.
[115:54.04]Alright, I'm going.
[116:01.01]I'm just fucking going fast.
[116:03.19]I know where they are.
[116:03.85]I...
[116:20.73]Uh-huh.
[116:21.83]Uh-huh.
[116:30.03]Yep.
[116:32.28]Okay.
[116:34.82]Mm-hmm.
[116:36.76]Okay.
[116:38.24]Yep.
[116:39.24]Yep.
[116:39.64]Yep.
[116:40.18]Okay.
[116:48.75]Okay.
[116:49.79]I...
[116:51.64]I'm not... Let's go.
[116:53.38]Where is it?
[116:54.82]Why do I hear like a ticking sound?
[116:56.06]There's a turret on my right?
[117:10.74]Thank you.
[117:28.47]The game has an auto- I gotta turn the auto-aim off.
[117:33.76]That's the problem.
[117:35.50]Where is it?
[117:37.80]Where is it?
[117:43.44]Where is it?
[117:44.00]Okay, now go heal.
[117:57.71]Where is she?
[118:17.54]Alright, I feel more calm.
[118:21.86]Did I get a permanent health upgrade?
[118:23.14]Where'd it go?
[118:34.79]I don't have a permanent health upgrade?
[118:40.78]Oh, it only had one charge.
[118:42.10]Okay.
[118:42.36]Alright.
[118:42.82]Not going to let this guy kill me this time.
[118:44.28]Not going to blow it.
[118:46.26]He's just waiting.
[118:46.92]I didn't get him in the head.
[118:49.16]Alright.
[118:49.40]Hold on.
[118:49.70]He's dead.
[118:58.11]But now there's, I think, a turret over here.
[119:00.35]Alright.
[119:05.07]Let's fucking go.
[119:10.29]Need to con the hacks into opening it.
[119:13.02]To con the hacks into opening it?
[119:17.52]What?
[119:33.30]Who's the hacks?
[119:44.86]I think I needed that guy.
[119:47.20]Are you alive?
[119:47.92]Get up.
[119:48.20]Do you have a thing on you?
[119:49.36]Does that guy have a thing on him?
[119:53.50]I need you to come with me and open this door over here.
[119:56.15]Oh no, my one hacker.
[120:00.99]You...
[120:17.08]This is so hard to control.
[120:26.28]Where's the other one?
[120:27.28]He's right over there.
[120:28.30]Come on.
[120:28.76]I need a hacker.
[120:33.52]Hacker!
[120:38.29]Wait, he just opened the door.
[120:40.61]Holy shit, he opened the door.
[120:41.37]I got him.
[120:52.03]Riot is now under control.
[120:54.48]Please await silence before returning to your positions.
[121:01.54]Alright.
[121:08.75]Now that door is open.
[121:11.89]Or something, right?
[121:29.14]God damn it.
[121:30.52]Give me a checkpoint.
[121:36.78]I couldn't.
[121:37.98]I tried.
[121:38.68]Okay, I got you.
[121:48.66]Checkpoint.
[121:49.86]Checkpoint.
[121:50.66]Yes.
[122:05.31]I would love it if the credits just rolled.
[122:16.94]There's a slow close up to Vin Diesel's face.
[122:20.94]His eyes are wide open and he's just fucking dead.
[122:36.50]I do have an... Would that actually work?
[122:42.25]If there was a person underneath you and you fell and you landed right on them, would they die?
[122:46.93]Okay, what if it was like five people?
[122:49.91]I'm talking like you have one, two, three, four, five.
[122:52.47]And you're like... You're like the sixth person.
[122:56.67]Still no?
[122:57.17]On this timed mission?
[123:10.39]What is it, Gollum?
[123:12.39]What was that?
[123:14.87]Oh shit!
[123:26.84]Oh my god, it really is!
[123:38.60]Oh my goodness.
[123:40.87]This just turned into a completely different video game in the last 30 seconds.
[123:47.37]I feel like I'm playing Killing Floor.
[123:58.76]Alright, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[124:02.30]Oh no.
[124:03.67]Okay, what do I... I don't even know what the goal is.
[124:15.36]Open this door!
[124:30.75]Why don't bullets work anymore on these explosive barrels?
[124:37.88]Wait, I'm...
[124:45.12]Okay, I think it's scripted.
[124:47.08]It's not actually five minutes.
[124:59.15]See, we're good.
[125:02.81]We're good.
[125:15.11]Don't waste ammo.
[125:16.69]Yeah, you're right.
[125:17.11]Is this guy talking?
[125:19.70]Wait, was there a guy over here?
[125:56.93]I don't even know where to go.
[126:04.21]Is this it?
[126:18.34]I think I got it.
[126:22.51]Did I get it?
[126:26.99]This looks new.
[126:27.51]I think this is new.
[126:32.13]Is this new?
[126:41.84]No.
[126:42.86]Wait.
[126:43.62]Which... Are you kidding me?
[126:45.94]This...

[127:19.83]Oh my god.
[127:21.11]I Have no where am I supposed to go?
[127:27.91]Was I not supposed to go down?
[127:28.93]Keep turning left, you will get there.
[127:34.32]That's going to put me in a circle.
[127:49.51]There was a...
[127:56.65]Find the exit from the pit.
[128:00.58]Well, this is not good.
[128:01.62]Okay, so this goes over here.
[128:05.18]I can go up, but that just leads me back up anyways, right?
[128:09.32]Or should I go this way?
[128:10.16]Is it broken?
[128:13.09]No, that just leads me back up.
[128:18.47]Wasn't somebody just talking to me over here?
[128:20.31]Is there more than one ways to go?
[128:24.74]There was a guy over here that was talking.
[128:30.12]Okay, right here.
[128:32.56]So what's going on here?
[128:33.64]Can I jump up?
[128:35.22]Can I like blast through this?
[128:36.32]Can I open this?
[128:49.55]A hole.

[128:57.57]No, no.
[128:59.07]No.
[128:59.81]No.
[129:00.11]You're talking about this hole right here?
[129:02.53]This fucking hole here?
[129:06.95]That's not- I don't fit through there.
[129:08.17]I don't have any bullets.
[129:17.31]I can't fit through this hole!
[129:22.05]You have to squeeze through.
[129:23.17]I definitely cannot make it through there.
[129:25.35]There's a way up through the top.
[129:49.56]Is there?
[129:49.92]I don't see anything.
[129:52.98]It's the longest one minute I think I've ever seen.
[129:55.11]Stop going down here in the first place.
[130:02.17]Explore the first floor.
[130:03.29]I don't even have a flashlight.
[130:29.51]This is the first floor.
[130:39.60]Please, please.
[130:42.04]Guys, I have no idea where to go.
[130:45.78]Do I have to jump up on one of the banisters?
[130:49.56]Okay, I found it.
[130:57.98]I went every single place but here.
[131:00.20]Come on.
[131:00.68]Give me a break.
[131:01.34]I don't have any bullets.
[131:07.10]I'm in a lot of trouble.
[131:17.13]Leave us be, sinners.
[131:19.29]This lamb is special.
[131:21.83]A unique specimen.
[131:27.28]I'm fighting.
[131:27.60]I'm fighting somebody in the dark.
[131:31.28]The lights could turn on.
[131:32.08]This could end up being like a little kid.
[131:33.74]I don't know.
[131:45.19]I can't.
[131:45.51]Maybe it'll reload me with actual bullets and shit.
[131:48.81]Yeah.
[131:50.73]Okay.
[131:51.13]Good, good.
[131:51.65]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[132:00.99]Uh-huh.
[132:01.61]Uh-huh.
[132:02.27]Sure, sure, sure, sure.
[132:03.35]Give me the lore.
[132:03.91]Give me the story.
[132:05.53]I don't care about any of that.
[132:07.49]I just want to... Hold on.
[132:08.35]It's not over here.
[132:08.83]It's over here.
[132:10.43]Yo.
[132:24.32]Hey, you, open that up.
[132:26.98]Make way for the messenger.
[132:29.30]I am the light and the darkness.
[132:32.44]Justice and vengeance.
[132:36.91]Or the universe will consume you.
[132:41.75]Okay, at least I have two bullets.
[132:43.83]I have 50.
[132:44.67]Never mind, I'm good to go.
[132:47.10]Okay, good.
[132:48.66]We've done it.
[132:54.79]Alright, that's not explosive.
[132:57.61]Alright, what does he want?
[133:07.83]Wait, did he just do the Suicide Squad Joker?
[133:15.69]No, he is.
[133:17.33]He's going, ah.
[133:34.82]Oh, yeah.
[133:39.35]Aim better.
[133:39.95]Get out of here.
[133:40.87]What?
[133:56.71]You won't survive long.
[133:58.07]I thought he was a boss.
[134:00.09]The dwellers will smell.
[134:01.57]He told me.
[134:02.99]He told me you would come.
[134:04.81]Come.
[134:05.71]We must travel up here.
[134:06.87]I live above.
[134:07.91]Am I still crouching?
[134:10.90]No.
[134:18.54]You need that gaze that shows right from wrong and reveals the door.
[134:29.06]Caramel walk.
[134:40.11]Ooh, what's this?
[134:41.49]Flares!
[134:44.49]What can you do with a flare?
[134:47.18]He spoke to me about you, Reddy.
[134:51.40]But how do I know you're not a simple imposter?
[134:55.38]Can you stitch me or not?
[134:58.24]yes yes but first get me back my blessed voice box a dangerous task made more so by the dwellers it would prove that you are what he told me I don't prove anything to anyone the voice box and I will tend to your wounds the flowers in that box will provide the light you need oh god not another one of these how many do I have how do they work
[135:30.23]Can I do anything special?
[136:03.92]They don't last very long.
[136:06.68]I can get more than seven?
[136:07.76]How many can I have?
[136:09.08]Oh.
[136:12.02]Okay.
[136:12.96]I think I ended up with a broken elbow after that one.
[136:18.30]Alright, let's go.
[136:35.84]You cured my hangover, but you gave me a broken arm.
[136:44.84]Do you want me to leave?
[136:47.97]Lights.
[136:48.29]Press the light button.
[137:01.14]I can't turn my flashlight off.
[137:09.67]Alright, so what does he want me to do?
[137:10.71]Pope Joe seems to be able to help you if you can find his blessed voice box.
[137:17.22]Do I have to go down?
[137:25.78]It's a radio.
[137:26.49]Alright, so I have 12 flares.
[137:44.58]So, what the hell am I supposed to do?
[137:49.82]Oh, find his voice box.
[137:57.25]Just find it, okay.
[137:59.45]I'm gonna see if I can find it.
[138:07.65]This is what the flares are for.
[138:09.30]God damn it.
[138:11.22]You know how awesome this game must have been to develop?
[138:14.04]Imagine being a game designer and a world designer and you only have to make a walkway right here.
[138:21.04]Nothing else matters.
[138:23.96]Everything else doesn't need to be rendered.
[138:26.98]You could hide so much shit in the darkness.
[138:29.90]Speaking of the darkness.
[138:32.68]Somebody right in front of me.
[138:41.86]Nope.
[138:46.88]Shit.
[138:56.62]How many people are in front of me?
[138:59.65]Alright, I know there's a door there.
[139:10.41]Got it.
[139:10.91]Where is it?
[139:11.19]I can hear it.
[139:13.86]I hear this damn thing.
[139:24.05]Thank you.
[139:27.43]Let's go.
[139:27.87]Out.
[139:37.13]What is this guy going to help me do?
[139:40.35]Um...
[139:44.59]I don't know.
[139:45.11]I don't... Where's the exit?
[139:58.72]Alright.
[139:59.04]Let's go.
[140:12.00]He's going to give me night vision?
[140:13.46]Wait, is he going to give me the thing?
[140:15.56]That I can actually see in the dark?
[140:23.20]That would be awesome.
[140:24.30]Here you go.
[140:25.98]Nice.
[140:40.80]I knew it, comrade.
[140:41.94]I knew it.
[140:44.50]It has all been foretold.
[140:52.60]The pain will be with you for a long time.
[140:55.93]Embrace it, and it will serve you well.
[141:00.75]Pain and I are old friends.
[141:07.61]Joe, where'd you get all the toys?
[141:12.26]You only need to unravel his mystery.
[141:14.60]Somebody got it, thanks.
[141:40.03]Why am I thanking you for getting a reference to a game?
[141:42.09]Who cares?
[141:57.51]I really feel like the only way you can talk like this is seriously if you lie down in bed with your chin down.
[142:05.68]You have to have just woken up.
[142:08.24]You have to just open your eyes and put the mic in front of you.
[142:16.70]I sound like this sometimes in the morning.
[142:20.34]They're never wrong.
[142:22.72]It is beautiful.
[142:25.76]I see you being surrounded by much suffering.
[142:31.99]What did you do?
[142:33.47]Just made your... just helped fix your arm.
[142:38.27]Pleadings!
[142:38.89]I'm light.
[142:47.00]Careful how you look at me.
[142:51.28]So wait, now it's very bright and I can see in the dark?
[143:00.55]Now I can't look at lights.
[143:04.87]Somebody said, auto voice?
[143:08.79]With your new shined eyes, you can see in the dark.
[143:11.61]Press up to toggle night vision on and off.
[143:17.46]That's not very good.
[143:18.72]Uh...
[143:25.10]Why don't I just get night vision goggles?
[143:27.54]I wouldn't have to completely ruin my body and have a weird surgery and shit.
[143:31.80]Just put on night vision goggles.
[143:32.96]They're better than this.
[143:34.96]What year does this take place?
[143:37.51]Night vision goggles have to exist, right?
[143:50.58]This is 2203.
[143:51.70]This is going to be a real pain in the ass once we go up to 100.
[143:57.67]How do you say the year 2106?
[144:00.45]2106?
[144:00.47]2106?
[144:00.49]216?
[144:00.55]How are you going to say that?
[144:17.92]Yeah, once it gets to like 2645... 2645.
[144:20.96]Yeah, I guess it's not that hard.
[144:33.90]I really don't like this.
[144:36.00]This just reminds me of putting on 3D glasses and looking at the regular world and not the screen.
[144:50.42]Can't talk.
[144:52.28]Turn up the gamma?
[144:53.22]I could.

[150:31.63]I'm very recognizable.
[150:34.74]Why don't you get a fake beard?
[150:35.98]Do these guys recognize me?

[152:10.81]What?
[152:33.54]Somebody's fucking with me.
[152:35.19]He's like... Don't get too close.
[152:47.25]That's how they see through you.
[152:51.58]Come back later.
[152:53.06]I'm practicing my speech.
[153:01.35]I'm just being annoying.
[153:02.53]I'm just ringing everybody's doorbells and then running away.
[153:04.37]Alright, he's practicing his speech.
[153:13.96]Cool.
[153:15.48]Oh. 2012.
[153:28.38]Alright, get... You go that way.
[153:30.02]Don't look at me.
[153:31.24]You'll recognize me as Riddick.
[153:34.52]Wait, talk to who?
[153:37.18]What's up?
[153:37.74]Hey.
[153:39.38]Can I look... Can we do anything?
[153:40.85]No, you can't.
[153:45.09]How come this guy instantly... Because I had a gun in my hand?
[153:52.95]So they dragged this Riddick to the pit.
[153:54.77]But he jumped and took some rookie down with him.
[153:58.69]How you doing?
[153:59.37]No kidding.
[154:00.03]I saw him a half an hour ago.
[154:01.79]He was heading to his village.
[154:03.25]Everyone gave him a wide path.
[154:07.29]Ooh, okay.
[154:07.81]9-7-12.
[154:08.05]Oh, you're going to open the door?

[154:21.80]No?
[154:22.68]Okay.
[154:23.34]See ya.
[154:28.42]No, I haven't heard anything.
[154:34.02]In fact... So, wouldn't everybody know that I have a really low voice?
[154:40.09]How does Vin Diesel do a higher voice if he doesn't want people... How does he do like the... How does he go like this?
[154:45.17]Can he?
[154:45.49]I feel like Vin Diesel... I don't think he'd be able to do it.
[154:52.22]Hey, if you see Abbott, tell him to calm down.
[155:03.64]What am I doing?
[155:04.14]Just get out, right?
[155:06.68]I just have to leave.
[155:09.60]What the fuck are you doing?
[155:28.58]Can't open this?
[155:33.32]Is it to find a way out?
[155:34.48]Is something to do with the codes that I'm seeing?
[155:36.52]Like the hamburger codes?
[155:38.16]I feel like it is.
[155:38.72]It's a hole?
[155:44.67]Have you heard anything about that, Rick?
[155:56.72]Hole.
[155:57.85]Someone said hole, hole, hole, hole.
[155:59.49]Where, where, where?

[156:30.56]We walk in circles.
[156:33.10]I'm trying to spice it up a little.
[156:49.26]Have you heard anything about that Riddick?
[157:02.97]It's definitely something to do with the ham.
[157:07.37]What?
[157:08.61]Why did I just do that?
[157:11.80]Alright, don't be weird.

[170:23.16]Straight?
[170:27.23]I'm just trying to get information, man.
[170:29.83]Hey, man.

[170:50.39]What's going on in here?
[170:57.07]Who's there?
[171:02.02]I'm sleeping.
[171:02.96]Go away!
[171:03.42]Obviously not because he answered the door.
[171:04.72]Hey!

[171:50.57]Well he's up for detox.
[171:51.89]I think it's the right thing for him.
[171:53.75]Maybe.
[171:54.41]But I understand it.
[171:56.08]He and Conroy always get the worst shifts.
[171:58.46]I've seen Conroy drinking hard.
[172:02.14]Yeah.
[172:02.88]I thought he was the toughest in their squad.
[172:04.98]Seems inevitable.
[172:06.04]They drop one.
[172:06.64]One by one.
[172:07.29]Nobody likes me.
[172:08.11]Talking to the bottle.
[172:09.69]At least the bottle doesn't talk back.
[172:11.69]G'day.
[172:14.55]G'day.
[172:15.71]G'day.
[172:16.49]G'day.
[172:17.35]G'day.
[172:18.95]We went on the Australian floor.
[172:20.95]I don't understand.
[172:21.77]Why are they saying g'day?
[172:22.74]Yeah, I don't know what you heard, but that Riddick, he's one tough son of a bitch.
[172:30.00]Who?
[172:30.70]Riddick?
[172:30.90]Yeah, I heard.
[172:33.80]What opinion?
[172:34.82]You got a. You got a problem if you're drawing that much attention at butchers.
[172:38.26]You seen him?
[172:39.54]Nah, I just heard what he looks like.
[172:41.54]Kind of like that guy.
[172:42.96]Right.
[172:43.72]Okay.
[172:45.42]Leave me alone.
[172:46.41]I'm on duty.
[172:47.71]Hi there.
[172:50.13]Kind of like that guy.
[172:54.29]Okay, that was fun.
[172:55.69]I guess I'll pick up the weapon case.
[172:59.16]I'm on duty.
[173:00.24]Abbott!
[173:07.22]Okay, I gave it ready.
[173:14.14]I got a package.
[173:22.28]The door before a door.
[173:23.49]Can you believe this guy?
[173:35.42]Who the fuck's in my apartment?
[173:37.38]Me.
[173:37.88]I just buzzed in, man.
[173:41.31]Hey, look, I have a package of rifles for you.
[173:46.10]You just opened the door for me, man.
[173:48.16]Is that a person?
[173:57.69]No.
[173:58.15]Oh, he knows who I am.
[174:02.83]Okay.
[174:04.29]Okay.
[174:24.98]Who else is in here?
[174:26.12]It was a person.
[174:26.94]I told you it was a person.
[174:28.11]How long you been here?
[174:30.33]Long enough.
[174:32.01]Yeah, look.
[174:32.85]He's not... He was the clone.
[174:34.01]Even though Abbott's a cocksucker, I'm going to suggest strongly that you not kill him.
[174:39.45]At least not until I get my plus 50.
[174:43.60]Now, you and I are leaving Butcher Bay.
[174:47.43]Yeah, what happened to the uniform?
[174:48.43]Not bad, Johns.
[174:50.47]Someday, you might just learn how to do this for a living.
[174:54.32]Going somewhere with my prisoner, Johns?
[174:59.62]But not today.
[175:00.40]Oh no, the double double cross.
[175:11.05]Well now what?
[175:12.05]I should just have them put slugs in both your heads right now.
[175:15.77]Why ruin a nice carpet?
[175:19.44]Moxie, it was just a matter of time and I was going to bring Riddick back to you.
[175:26.74]How about our agreement, Johns?
[175:29.34]I'm willing to give you 20% on Riddick.
[175:30.70]Oh, I'm going to have to fight him in the pit, right?
[175:38.66]Let him answer.
[175:39.32]He's punching him in the fucking stomach.
[175:42.52]I think he wants to hold out for more.
[175:44.80]You could be right.
[175:47.48]22%.
[175:49.04]I'll take it.
[175:50.48]What do you say?
[175:51.92]22%.
[175:55.08]Nobody steals my property from my house, Jones.
[175:59.88]Now get the fuck out of my slam.
[176:02.92]Alright, Hoxie.

[176:43.87]I can see why you earned your rep.
[176:46.86]You almost killed my second in command today.
[176:49.14]The treasure.
[176:50.58]Just working my way to the top.
[176:55.13]Even more reason for me to bury you deep.
[177:01.84]Why not just kill him?
[177:04.28]I don't understand.
[177:05.66]Why let him go?
[177:06.67]Just get rid of him.
[177:07.41]Just shoot him.
[177:08.25]I'll be disappointed if they don't.
[177:28.27]I'm gonna do the butt, the rifle, and the head, right?
[177:30.51]And then I'm gonna wake up.
[177:31.64]No, wow.
[177:33.36]They didn't do that.
[177:34.90]Shit, that's in every single thing ever made.
[177:38.31]I'm surprised.
[177:42.59]I just got a slight push in the shoulder.
[177:44.43]I thought it was going to be, eat this bastard!
[177:47.79]And you wake up here.
[177:51.62]It could contain the comms, but could never control them.
[177:56.86]So inside the bay walls was chaos, desperation, madness, and death.
[178:04.29]It's burning!
[178:05.45]It's in my head!
[178:07.29]Oh, you gotta help me!

[178:27.94]Oh, man.
[178:35.38]Oh, man, no.
[178:35.88]Wait.
[178:43.84]The security turrets were a real crowd pleaser to everyone except the janitors.
[179:01.67]Usually you take the road downtown.
[179:03.89]Haven't you run?
[179:06.01]I was going up.

[180:15.69]Shh, quiet.
[180:16.11]Let's watch the show.
[180:16.87]They didn't even give me fucking opportunity to make my YouTube joke.
[180:28.66]Oh shit, there is no talking.
[180:31.96]Aw, I wanted to just turn and talk.
[180:44.96]Not now.

[181:17.53]I don't know, okay?
[181:18.59]I have no idea.
[181:20.73]I have a horrible, horrible attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
[181:26.75]That means if there's not constant action and constant conflict, I go, I lose my mind.
[181:33.23]I know some things you'd want to know.
[181:35.59]Let's talk in here.
[181:36.57]Getting out of Max is one thing.
[181:38.85]After your show above ground, some even think you're going to push Jagger Valance down.
[181:43.29]But double Max is quite another.
[181:45.80]Wait, this is a super prison underneath the prison?
[181:47.64]Is it like a third or fourth layer?
[182:18.31]Are we gonna get to see the Dante's Inferno of Prison Structure?
[182:32.17]Who's this guy?
[182:33.67]Centurion.
[182:35.03]Hey Riddick.
[182:35.89]Let's go.
[182:36.43]Time to get into the ring.
[182:37.67]What?
[182:38.15]Why?
[182:39.79]Set it up.
[182:40.31]Sure.
[182:40.83]A fight will cost you five UDs.
[182:43.09]But I'll let you in free.
[182:44.75]Try not to disappoint.
[182:46.37]Just send me a victim.
[182:48.53]It's hard to say you.
[182:49.45]Like that.
[182:50.65]Like that guy.
[183:17.44]A stab bag newcomer.
[183:21.89]It's my dream to work in the mines and meet Jack of Islands.
[183:25.97]Eh.
[183:28.13]Hey man, how's it going?
[183:29.33]Got a med station back here.
[183:31.21]I'll let you use it if you pay me.
[183:32.26]I have to fight this guy?
[183:34.92]No.
[183:35.14]No need.
[183:35.78]Why would I need that?
[183:39.28]Alright, you.
[183:40.20]Kill you.
[183:41.34]I get past.
[183:43.65]He's always a deeper voice.
[183:46.35]This feels bad.
[183:48.59]This guy sounds like he's old.
[183:51.37]Why would I pick the oldest, weakest, frailest guy in here?
[184:04.16]Great.
[184:04.58]You have a challenger.
[184:06.04]Prepare to fight, Riddick.
[184:08.86]Alright, we have a fight.
[184:10.10]We have a fight.
[184:11.28]The infamous Riddick against Herman.
[184:12.72]All bets are off.
[184:14.78]And remember, 5% goes to Jack O'Fallon.
[184:17.30]The infamous Riddick versus this other guy.
[184:20.10]Who cares?
[184:20.54]He's dead.
[184:23.08]Nobody cares about him.
[184:24.36]He's fucking guaranteed to die.
[184:37.29]The infamous Riddick!
[184:44.41]The infamous Riddick!
[184:49.98]Mr. Riddick, what happened?

[186:05.87]He went out of the circle.
[186:06.85]I did win.
[186:11.82]He's dead.
[186:33.53]So, what, I just keep killing people down here?
[186:35.70]Yeah.
[186:37.30]What?

[188:21.36]Somebody will see it.
[188:50.68]Where's this person I'm supposed to be?
[188:57.16]I didn't do anything.
[189:01.10]Wait.
[189:02.08]Am I about... How?
[189:08.75]Where is it?
[189:10.51]Where is the ship?
[189:15.65]That's the question that you need to ask.
[189:18.23]Where is the ship?
[189:24.40]No, don't do it again.
[189:32.30]He's not going to find it this time, right?
[189:33.82]Get out of here.
[189:44.57]I so badly want to take it out and just be like, haha, you missed it.
[189:49.39]Where's this guy?
[189:50.08]There's a person here I'm supposed to be fighting.

[190:00.84]I didn't see anybody.
[190:01.50]Haha, you missed it.
[190:09.79]Yeah.

[192:09.73]Talk to Qualis.
[192:15.34]Hey.
[192:16.67]Alright, where is this guy?
[192:17.59]I wanna fight the dude.
[192:19.13]Wait, do you have a secret list?
[192:21.21]Stay away from me.
[192:22.75]I got important stuff to do.
[192:28.21]Who has the list?
[192:29.25]Do you have a list on you?
[192:30.35]I need a list.
[192:35.03]Why won't you talk?
[192:35.59]Hey guys.
[192:42.85]Sure, I'll take a pack of smokes.
[192:44.01]For free.
[192:53.27]What do you know?
[192:53.91]What do you know?
[192:55.06]I know.
[192:55.98]Now.
[192:56.78]There's a big mining area underneath us, right?
[192:59.40]It's off limits to everyone.
[193:01.02]But Jagger Valance is down there.
[193:03.16]So I hear.
[193:04.58]Section D is an entrance if you want to take a look.
[193:08.18]And if you want something other than smokes, say hello to Monster in the diner.
[193:14.27]Good link.
[193:14.89]Monster is connected.
[193:16.27]Yeah, it's been 20 minutes.
[193:17.45]And he is cute.
[193:22.80]This is not even me, though.
[193:23.98]You know what I mean?
[193:26.67]This is not even me.
[193:27.45]This is just... It's just Riddick holding these.
[193:56.93]Alright, who knows what's going on here?
[193:59.21]Okay, who knows?
[194:01.62]Do you know?
[194:02.14]I can kill it.
[194:02.92]Fuck.
[194:03.22]How did I miss it?
[194:03.96]Stop, I'm not... Wait, this is the guy.
[194:05.42]Can I stab this guy in the ring?
[194:06.92]Alright, I'm ready.
[194:07.38]Okay, stay back.
[194:33.27]I need to get him, but there's no way I can get a shift through.
[194:36.64]There's an old trick you can use.
[194:38.26]You have an old style filter smoke and a lighter?
[194:41.66]I'm gonna smoke the bitch to death?
[194:44.92]No, you dumb fuck.
[194:47.94]You burn the filter and work it into a needle.
[194:50.82]It's kind of fragile, so you don't want to work it too much.
[194:53.88]Stab him in the neck and he's done, man.
[194:56.50]Shit.
[194:57.86]I heard of that thing, of course.
[195:00.46]That's what I'm...
[195:06.21]Kind of like that.
[195:14.02]I did it wrong.
[195:15.50]I didn't even do it right.
[195:16.68]I was supposed to stab him in the neck and I stabbed him in the ass.
[195:19.10]Two PPP members?
[195:33.25]Those bastards stole the red tube that I really need.
[195:37.49]Find out where they stashed it and bring it to me.
[195:41.79]I'll pay you.
[195:43.50]Okay.
[195:45.56]I'll check it out.
[195:46.26]Alright.
[195:49.02]I have way too many quests.
[195:52.18]Hey, man.

[197:01.43]Bingo.
[197:02.09]What?
[197:02.25]I didn't pick 12?
[197:03.21]Yeah.
[197:24.84]Heard you pulled off some stunts in the circle.
[197:27.86]Say, you got a mining job?
[197:29.44]Everybody wants me to do something for them.
[197:30.82]No.
[197:31.62]Need one.
[197:32.74]Impossible.
[197:33.90]Unless you get assigned by the warden.
[197:36.76]Reason I ask is because I want to know if Jagger Valance is still around.
[197:42.84]I almost feel like that every single character in this game is doing a Vin Diesel impression.
[197:51.28]They were told that in the voice acting booth.
[197:55.12]If that's true, that's awesome.
[197:59.34]That's hysterical.
[198:00.46]I hope that's the case.
[198:01.25]Except for this guy.
[198:16.65]Binks, one of the K3 guys in the diner.
[198:20.15]But you can't do him with muscles.
[198:22.85]I have so many missions to do.
[198:25.49]But don't kill him.
[198:26.49]I'll make sure he knows I'm the sender of that message.
[198:30.96]Alright, so I have to put poison in somebody's food?
[198:33.30]Fight a guy?
[198:33.92]How many missions do I have?
[198:36.12]Okay.
[198:37.40]Go talk to Dogbone.
[198:41.06]Go beat up the fighter.
[198:43.89]Find out who took the list.
[198:46.01]Find the red tube.
[198:48.39]Where Jagger Valance is.
[198:51.75]And poison a guy.
[198:54.97]Okay.
[198:56.51]Uh, I'm gonna go over here.
[198:57.89]Bye.
[198:58.09]What the fuck is that?
[198:59.97]I never heard of him.
[199:01.07]You know the vents go all over this place.
[199:03.85]There's one that goes from the Dying Hall over to Zotus Land in Tower 19.
[199:08.66]Yeah.
[199:09.38]Anyway, Padilla, the crazy mother.
[199:11.80]Hey, do you want anything?
[199:15.31]One-on-one with an officer.
[199:17.47]Why is Reddick Probe so small?
[199:43.24]He kinda does.
[199:44.74]He actually kinda does look pretty little.
[199:46.60]You're right.
[199:48.97]I haven't even noticed that the whole time.
[199:51.27]Hey, homie.
[199:55.76]You wanna trade drugs?
[199:58.78]Alright.
[199:59.70]Do me a favor.
[200:02.10]Tell me more.
[200:03.48]Okay, I need your help on two things, man.
[200:06.17]First, I need my injector back from the PPPs.
[200:08.93]Look, Gulag has some history with them.
[200:10.87]He'll tell you more.
[200:12.11]Second, Basim is really bumming me out.
[200:14.61]So I need you to waste him in the ring for me.
[200:17.42]What are you going to do?
[200:18.38]How about it, man?
[200:19.22]Let's go.
[200:19.72]I can do it.
[200:20.10]I'm already going to do that.
[200:23.36]What, you want to front me?
[200:25.22]I am Sorenos.
[200:26.56]You want to see the PPPs?
[200:28.53]Check the A section.
[200:31.08]Alright, PPPs.
[200:37.34]I think I have enough stuff to do.
[200:40.64]Work?
[200:40.94]What is this?
[200:42.16]Work pass?
[200:42.94]I have to go to the diner, don't I?
[200:45.22]Wait, I actually have to do work?
[200:58.25]I'm not gonna help you get down to the mines.
[201:00.97]If that's what you want.
[201:02.81]It's impossible.
[201:03.95]The mines.
[201:05.29]I need to get to them.
[201:07.19]You should talk to Flores in the quarter.
[201:09.84]I just worked on it.
[201:11.20]I didn't just say you can't do anything.
[201:13.16]I'll be damned if I didn't forget my glasses.
[201:15.68]If you're going down there.
[201:17.02]You're close.
[201:17.78]Give them to me.
[201:18.92]There's a big elevator in upper mines.
[201:22.14]Just do everything.
[201:27.68]You have a quest?
[201:29.90]Ow!
[201:32.52]I just want to see if this guy has a mission to do.
[201:34.68]My god.
[201:35.46]I don't know the code.
[201:48.91]You're supposed to know every code.
[201:56.34]I so badly want to stab this thing in the back.
[201:58.24]Do I know the code for this door?
[202:06.91]Okay, I'm not fucking around with this guy.
[202:14.67]I have so many missions, I have no idea what they are.
[202:16.69]I'm just gonna walk around and aimlessly try to figure out one of them.
[202:24.25]We have to go to the dining hall.
[202:27.16]I have to fight the guy in the circle, go to the dining hall, poison a guy, get the red vial.
[202:33.17]Talk to Gulag.
[202:36.31]Where's Gulag?
[202:39.93]I don't even know... Like, three people want me to kill two people.
[202:44.07]Okay, right.
[202:44.65]Now...
[202:55.40]Let's go.
[202:56.24]Let's go.

[203:16.54]And then some.
[203:17.02]See you later.
[203:27.51]Alright.
[203:28.91]I'm going to fight that guy.
[203:29.93]I'm going to go back this way.
[203:30.99]I want to go to the dining hall, but I want to fight somebody in the circle.
[203:38.74]Where is this?
[203:39.28]Here he is.
[203:40.02]Alright, let's go.
[203:40.52]I'm ready.

[206:31.70]Nobody likes me, right?
[206:32.76]Oh.

[212:48.62]I got a vent tool, a club, and a shiv.
[212:52.32]All custom made.
[212:56.27]What did you say about killing all the NPCs?
[212:58.27]I know!
[212:58.99]I know.
[212:59.79]I only have a shiv and a club.
[213:04.45]I'll take the club.

[213:09.77]I don't think he is.
[213:19.96]Is he soft-locked for real?
[213:23.02]Fuck off, man.
[213:23.82]We're busy.
[213:25.97]Fuck off, man.
[213:26.75]We're busy.

[213:28.35]Fuck off, man.
[213:28.81]We're busy.

[213:39.31]I didn't kill two people, did I?
[213:41.82]Want to trade?
[213:43.12]Me and Monster run the trade market in Butcher Bay.

[213:47.10]I gots the smokes.
[213:52.65]Yeah, he's running goods from his spot in the diner.
[213:55.18]He's probably in there with Chang.
[213:57.80]So what do you say?
[213:58.94]How about some smoke?
[213:59.64]Yeah.

[214:37.46]Don't I have the snitch list?
[214:52.24]Map?
[214:52.62]This map shows the location of the secret stash, far back of the feed ward behind a loose panel.
[214:58.73]Really?
[215:13.76]Loose panel?
[215:22.09]Far back behind a loose panel.
[215:28.52]Ah.
[215:30.02]And there it is.
[215:31.66]And I've got a protractor and I've got fake Halloween blood.
[215:37.96]What is this stuff?
[215:40.12]The tube that was stolen from Gulag.
[215:42.04]Injector.
[215:43.14]A syringe used by some drug addict.
[215:52.14]He's not going to eat.
[215:54.80]Step away, okay?
[215:57.22]I've done my rounds in the ring.
[215:59.04]You don't want to fuss with me.
[216:00.24]I have to, like, get him out of his, like, animation loop he's in.
[216:03.92]I can't punch him.
[216:04.61]I'm going to get attacked.
[216:05.25]I'm going to reload the area.
[216:07.39]Hey.
[216:12.07]Look what I got.
[216:18.05]Come back when you have the whole snitch list.
[216:20.70]Hey, talk to players, alright?
[216:26.72]Alright, I'm going to come back.
[216:27.42]You're going to actually softlock.
[216:47.84]Your entire game is going to be ruined.
[216:49.30]What?
[216:52.16]Where?
[216:52.82]Fisher 2?
[216:53.89]Don't know.
[217:01.65]No, these guys are all still dead.
[217:04.27]No, he's just not going to sit down and eat.
[217:08.61]Fuck off, man.
[217:09.39]We're busy.
[217:16.88]Wait, he's moving.
[217:17.76]Okay, hold on.
[217:19.72]He turned.
[217:25.91]Go talk to nurse.
[217:30.19]Eh, get lost.
[217:36.18]Just kill him?
[217:36.88]I can't.
[217:37.94]I can't kill him.
[217:38.56]Alright, well I'm just gonna go turn in this shit.
[217:42.48]Whatever.
[217:42.82]If I can't do all the quests, who cares?
[217:44.48]I can come back.
[217:54.28]So I have the... I gotta go talk to Gulag.
[218:01.66]I got at least a few items.
[218:04.96]I've got the PPP stash.
[218:07.95]Got.
[218:08.23]Alright.
[218:11.97]Who do I. Who.
[218:12.79]Where are you?

[219:09.10]I'll loan you interest free.
[219:12.04]If you need money, feel free to ask anytime.
[219:14.60]I'll loan you interest free.
[219:15.54]How about I just don't pay it back?
[219:17.95]Got more than 10, so don't borrow anything.
[219:24.03]Not interested.
[219:28.71]Okay.
[219:28.93]Well, that's quite... What else do I have to turn in?
[219:30.25]Okay.
[219:34.69]Speak to Dogbone.
[219:37.36]Go back to Centurion and he'll start the fight.
[219:41.82]Enlist from a guard.
[219:43.06]Okay.
[219:46.08]That's that.
[219:46.70]Get drug.
[219:47.50]Okay.
[219:48.12]Two-Tongue won't deal unless you do two things for him.
[219:50.56]Get his injector back and defeat the guy in the ring.
[219:53.26]Alright.
[219:53.48]We have the injector.
[219:55.42]Where's Two-Tongue?
[219:57.58]There you are.
[219:58.73]I'm good.
[219:59.81]You?
[220:00.59]Wu Tong.
[220:06.69]He's in here, isn't he?
[220:09.11]Hey, look.
[220:09.39]Oh, shit.
[220:10.77]Thanks, dude.
[220:13.59]You don't know how much I needed this.
[220:15.29]Now beat the guy up.
[220:16.67]Now I just need Basim hosed and we'll have smooth sailing.
[220:20.27]Hey, waste him in the ring for me, would you?
[220:23.23]Mm-hmm.
[220:25.11]Oh, shit.
[220:27.50]You want to see the PPPs?
[220:33.32]Alright, now I want to fight.
[220:35.54]I want to go back to Centurion.
[220:36.99]Is this guy saying the same thing over and over again?
[220:41.71]Alright, not this way.
[220:46.19]We got to go back to the tower, right?
[220:50.16]Start the fight.
[220:51.00]I just want to complete all the quests.
[221:08.94]Alright, not you.
[221:09.62]It's like that first area, right?
[221:13.12]Alright, where is he?
[221:18.95]Hour 17.
[221:19.39]Uh, oh, he's like, isn't he right here somewhere?
[221:24.39]Where's this guy?
[221:28.41]I think it's this.
[221:33.20]That's where.
[221:35.44]Say something, cute streamer.
[221:46.40]I'm ready.
[221:46.76]Let's go.
[221:47.96]Mm-hmm.
[222:11.17]I know the rules.
[222:12.07]You didn't tell me I couldn't bring a weapon to fight, did you?
[222:31.19]There was no rule that said I couldn't bring a spiked club.
[222:35.32]Redo your rules.
[222:36.88]I'm here to help you.
[222:44.03]Wow, let's go kill this guy.
[222:45.81]Yeah, let's go kill this guy.
[222:47.45]Yeah, I know who that guy is.
[222:48.85]That guy talked a lot of shit, but he didn't even read the rule book.
[222:53.98]Wait, you mean I could have brought a gun?
[222:56.92]Yep.
[222:57.10]You're stupid.
[223:29.13]I'm going to try to finish it with a parry too.
[223:32.02]I want to bury this thing in his head.
[223:45.45]They still haven't picked that guy up.
[223:51.16]He finally ate it.
[223:56.21]Yep.
[223:57.71]Okay.
[223:58.01]And you.
[223:58.53]I'll see you in the ring.
[224:00.67]Nice.
[224:00.91]Alright.
[224:02.17]Let's go.
[224:25.80]You're gonna rot!
[224:26.72]It's just Vince McMahon.
[224:31.00]You're gonna rot!
[224:34.45]And by the way, you're fucked!
[225:00.74]Local streamer stuns the entire McMahon family.
[225:11.37]Okay, bring him on.
[225:12.71]I'm gonna just make a bunch of money.
[225:14.11]I'll kill everybody in this prison if I have to.
[225:19.60]Alright.
[225:21.30]Keep making him stronger and stronger.
[225:25.24]Nobody knows that they can bring a weapon.
[225:29.43]This guy has a weapon.
[225:32.29]Oh, fuck.
[225:32.79]This guy invented rules.
[225:46.09]If that K3 had won, I'd have lost money.
[225:49.73]So I believe I owe you one, Riddick.
[225:57.44]Oh no, they're getting smarter.
[226:02.98]Wait, give me that.
[226:03.48]Can I pick this up?
[226:04.04]Is it illegal?
[226:05.78]I got it.
[226:06.18]Cool.
[226:08.06]Wait, mine's cooler.
[226:08.84]I like mine.
[226:09.30]Yeah, I like mine.
[226:12.93]Mine looks like a Counter-Strike knife.
[226:15.44]It looks like I spent a lot of money on that.
[226:17.02]Oh no.
[226:17.64]Alright.
[226:18.72]I'll take him.
[226:19.32]Club him.
[226:19.66]You don't think I'm gonna club the next guy?
[226:46.25]Don't go near that guy.
[226:46.91]He's gonna search me.
[227:03.58]Alright.
[227:03.85]What's his name?
[227:05.03]Kuso?
[227:07.13]Kuso.
[227:09.63]Hey, Kuso.
[227:13.11]See you in the ring.
[227:14.65]Hey, Kuso.

[227:48.12]You.
[227:48.60]Are you Kuso?
[227:50.00]No.

[227:51.14]What does he want me to do?
[227:53.72]Get a moth.
[227:55.32]Bring me one of those moths.
[227:57.28]I actually have to collect one of the bugs?
[228:01.17]I thought I was illegal.
[228:03.13]How do you get a bug?
[228:19.50]Hey, Kuso.
[228:21.26]Ah.
[228:21.84]You want to fight me, huh?

[228:37.51]He's so strong.
[228:38.59]That's what I would be doing right now.
[228:40.07]It would piss him off so much.
[228:45.78]Wait, put your both hands in the air with your palms facing out and kind of shake them back and forth while you lean your shoulders.
[228:52.86]Oh, yeah!
[228:53.96]People fucking hate that.
[228:57.72]Moth, moth.
[228:58.50]Where am I supposed to get one?
[228:59.52]I can't get a moth.
[229:17.93]I'm in violation, you see?
[229:19.48]What's happening here?

[231:46.31]Club?
[231:46.61]Yeah, I'm going to club him.
[231:51.55]This guy thinks he's going to bring a knife to a club fight.
[231:55.45]Or he might be the reason why he's the strongest opponent is because he has a club himself.
[232:00.29]We'll find out.
[232:10.17]So, you got your challenge.
[232:11.91]You win, you get 20 UDs.

[232:46.12]Only one?
[232:46.50]And that's Bam.
[232:47.86]And he's one dangerous proposition.
[232:50.92]What do you mean Bam?
[232:53.20]Where is he?
[232:53.58]Is he down here?
[232:59.59]Where do I find Bam?
[233:05.39]I got a message from Bam.
[233:07.51]He'll fight.
[233:09.01]I have a problem.
[233:09.87]Will he now?
[233:10.47]Isn't he dead?

[233:14.31]Let's go.
[233:41.22]Wait, they have to bring this guy down?
[233:44.55]From upper management?
[233:48.39]Does he realize he's about to get fucking clubbed?
[233:50.27]Give me the club!

[239:25.05]The door is open.
[239:26.11]The door is an open door.
[239:28.47]What was the point of that?
[239:42.26]This guy keeps coming back.
[239:44.55]Wait, there's a gun.
[239:49.35]There's a gun.
[239:52.59]No, that was a club.
[239:53.39]Alright, this guy keeps coming back, so we're going to take him with us.
[239:58.37]I'm not going to let this guy come back for like a third time.
[240:12.16]Come on.
[240:13.06]Get up here.
[240:22.01]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[240:22.63]There's a ride.

[241:33.17]Alright, he's still alive.
[241:33.99]Whatever.
[241:34.27]Because I had this stupid club out.
[241:40.03]Club.
[241:40.43]No club allowed.
[241:42.09]Okay, but what about... This is the ultimate test.
[241:45.42]I can't bring my club in there, but can I bring this dead body through?
[241:56.06]Nope.
[241:56.34]No clubs allowed.
[241:59.30]Dammit.
[241:59.96]I really thought it was gonna happen.
[242:08.50]You're... This isn't... No bodies allowed either.

[242:31.10]I couldn't escape.
[242:32.68]What am I doing back in the prison?
[242:35.49]I just... What am I doing back here?
[242:37.05]I could have just got the hell out of here.
[242:42.25]Alright.
[242:44.61]Hold on.
[242:44.91]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[242:48.07]Lost his glasses in the mines.
[242:49.58]They might be in the upper mines.
[242:50.86]Okay.
[242:52.56]Let's see all the blue skins dead.
[242:54.60]Okay.
[242:56.74]I have to go down to the mines.
[242:57.90]You've got a special keycard from Abbott.
[242:59.60]It ought to open some door probably near the work pass.
[243:02.10]Whoa!
[243:06.70]Alright.
[243:07.04]I'm seeing a lot of Jerma dot dot dots.
[243:17.23]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[243:17.77]I was supposed to delete channel points.
[243:19.09]I forgot.
[243:19.79]Thanks for reminding me.
[243:25.39]I need to go to the... There's a new guy over there.
[243:27.59]I'm not going over there.
[243:42.93]You wanna buy smokes?
[243:45.71]I like this guy's voice.
[243:53.46]Oh, well, I see that they have successfully ruined the chat room.
[243:58.40]It's nothing there now.
[244:00.00]It's just unreadable purple text.
[244:01.81]Okay.
[244:07.77]Really wanted to have a nice chat room.
[244:11.66]But I guess that's just not going to be the case.
[244:15.16]Okay.
[244:15.32]Okay.
[244:23.73]Just the key card.
[244:24.45]Does this guy have anything?
[244:26.80]If you find my glasses.
[244:28.16]Okay, find glasses.
[244:30.48]Go.
[244:36.34]Uh.
[244:38.05]Who is surrendering?
[244:38.85]Oh.
[244:54.40]I don't want that guy to be dead.
[244:55.56]No, I did the Dark Souls and it killed me so I can do... Just kill me, kill me, kill me, kill me.
[245:01.00]I don't want that guy to die.
[245:02.44]I was gonna break his neck but it didn't work.
[245:05.95]So what happened?
[245:08.85]Access granted and then he came after me.
[245:15.89]Over here?
[245:16.31]Access granted.
[245:30.75]Dude, I just... Touch the reactor.
[245:47.96]Okay, so, two doors.
[245:50.06]They both have bad guys in them.
[245:51.40]I have to get down to the mines somehow.
[245:55.34]Uh, if I open this door, this guy freaks out, so I have to go in this one.
[245:59.14]I have to.
[245:59.52]Access granted.
[246:05.71]Still have points.
[246:06.49]I guarantee you there's people that have... There's people that have... There's probably people that have... Why is that hard to say?
[246:12.17]That guy... You actually saw me through the wall.
[246:24.08]If you find my glasses, give them to me and I will help you in return.
[246:28.60]Okay.
[246:33.60]If you find my glasses, give them to me and I will help you in return.
[246:41.69]Did we fuck it up?
[246:42.77]Are we safe?
[246:43.83]I think we're safe.
[246:50.27]Are you going to punch him?
[246:53.35]He's not going to throw a punch, is he?
[246:57.00]This fucking reset.
[246:57.96]Okay, so... Should I just run through the door?
[247:12.61]Like, who cares?
[247:18.87]I have to stealth.
[247:26.80]Look, I open the door and the guy goes, There he is with the boxes!
[247:31.52]Ready, watch.
[247:33.26]I found him!
[247:44.95]Why do these guys all have laser sights on him?
[247:55.25]Do I have to go over here?
[247:56.57]Like, I'm going to climb up.
[248:03.28]How would you even know that?
[248:04.70]How would you know that?
[248:05.26]There's no way you could have known that.
[248:06.20]I didn't do anything.
[248:11.36]Hmm.
[248:13.02]Nothing here.
[248:30.79]Wait, give me the gun.
[248:31.25]Give me the gun.
[248:35.48]Riddick mode.
[248:46.64]What?
[248:46.84]Didn't I get the DNA for this?
[249:02.78]Wait, vent tool, right?
[249:04.94]I don't know.
[249:05.34]A real wink?
[249:07.68]It's been disabled.
[249:08.58]It's not there.
[249:09.02]They can't trick me.
[249:19.33]That shit's been disabled.
[249:21.97]Months.
[249:24.93]My bet's on carbon.
[249:31.70]Wait, why am I in an elevator?
[249:35.32]Oh.
[249:35.50]Did I make it to the mines?
[249:40.65]No, no winks.
[249:41.41]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[249:42.67]I don't have any clothes on.
[249:46.53]I cannot do what you ask.
[249:48.61]Did I get him?
[249:49.49]Come on!
[250:18.38]I need the DNA.
[250:19.26]Okay.
[250:21.50]This is the Harry Potter ride.
[250:23.54]The exact image of when Voldemort's sitting on the rock and there's two or three people.
[250:28.43]It's that ride at Universal.
[250:30.57]You end up coming down.
[250:31.31]You eavesdrop on a conversation they have.
[250:34.17]Right here.
[250:35.17]This exact spot.
[250:47.09]I'm not making a joke.
[250:48.15]That's just reality.
[250:49.67]I just had to say it because that's what I saw.
[250:55.03]I'm telling you, that's what it is.
[250:57.07]When you go there, you're going to be like, oh shit, that's right.
[251:02.27]Okay, I'll enter the correct code.
[251:04.93]-2, I've never been to Universal.
[251:06.33]Alright.
[251:17.51]Looking at the fan Come on stop it Oh
[251:44.07]I didn't get him.
[251:50.59]I didn't get it.
[251:54.50]Close it, close it, close it.
[251:55.58]Move out of the way.
[251:58.10]What?
[251:58.58]Enter the correct... Why is the door closed?
[252:14.00]Oh my lord.
[252:14.78]I'm not soft locked.
[252:24.27]I got it.
[252:24.65]I'll get it right now.
[252:26.61]I don't understand why I can't pick up the rifle.
[252:28.18]Through the mines and through Jagger Valance straight to the spaceport.
[253:05.80]I don't want me to fall and I know everyone thinks that everyone's waiting for... I know everyone's waiting for it to happen.
[253:14.20]So, I'm just gonna stop because I know everyone thinks that's what I'm doing and I'm not gonna give you that.
[253:18.42]I'm not doing it.
[253:19.72]I'm not gonna fall off.
[253:20.42]No.
[253:20.84]That's not what I'm doing.
[253:36.99]What's the point of this?
[253:44.13]Why can't I get up here?
[254:01.37]Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[254:05.37]Um, um, um, um, um, um, um.
[254:18.90]Climb.
[254:19.76]Climb.
[254:20.28]Climb.
[254:21.16]Climb where, though?
[254:24.53]On the bridge.
[254:24.97]There's a gun on the bridge.
[254:25.79]I can't pick it up.
[254:28.89]Climb up there?
[254:30.41]No?
[254:42.24]Yes, you can.
[254:47.13]There's a door by the lift.
[254:49.11]Is this a door?
[254:51.17]No, this is not what you think it is.
[254:56.17]Can't make that thing go up.
[255:03.71]Just dodge the bullets?
[255:13.40]Grab the gun.
[255:14.38]I can't grab the gun.
[255:15.40]I already tried it.
[255:18.79]It has to be something with this, right?
[255:20.27]I just don't know the code, but... Can these be moved?
[255:26.69]I mean, why would they be here like this?
[255:39.36]Go up here?
[255:46.92]Lure the guard with some noises?
[255:55.41]Uh, I'm just gonna go fight him.
[255:59.14]I'm just gonna go fight him.
[256:12.88]Get that gun.
[256:17.13]Alright, good.
[256:19.45]Did I really actually have to do that?
[256:21.47]See, watch.
[256:21.99]I can't touch it.
[256:28.80]Security checkpoint.
[256:40.82]I really do feel like I should have a gun at this point.
[257:06.89]Is there one of those big things right here?
[257:09.58]There is.
[257:09.92]Okay.
[257:12.30]Dude.
[257:18.90]Why are people saying piss and cock?
[257:26.50]I don't know.
[257:26.92]Why don't you ask them?
[257:29.14]I'm sure you'll get a detailed write-up of why they're doing that.
[257:33.14]Alright, so I... What am I missing here?
[257:35.76]I can't take any of the lights out.
[257:41.98]What's all this fuss about the pit?
[257:43.60]I didn't listen to the captain this morning.
[257:45.78]They found a passage from the pit straight into the guard's quarters.
[257:49.36]They caught a con up there.
[257:50.36]They believe he got through from the pit.
[257:52.48]Who was it?
[257:52.92]Was it British?
[257:53.96]New one everyone's talking about?
[257:54.94]Wait, you're talking about me?
[257:56.63]No showers for us tonight.
[257:58.19]No showers?
[258:04.43]Alright, now you move.
[258:05.41]Well, he looked at me.
[258:06.91]What was that?
[258:33.54]Okay, well, I'm obviously supposed to be here, but now what?
[258:35.56]Kylo Ren?
[258:37.02]Okay.
[259:02.37]What?
[259:02.65]I feel like Spaghet right now.
[259:10.55]Okay, I'm just... I can go through there.
[259:16.70]Wait.
[259:17.50]Climb this.
[259:29.04]Is there a light switch in here?
[259:30.30]There has to be, right?
[259:36.78]Where's the light switch?
[259:40.22]Please be behind me.
[259:41.36]Is there a light switch?
[259:48.34]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[259:50.44]I'm... Alright, I'm good, I'm good.
[259:55.19]Alright, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[259:57.73]I'm going this way.
[260:01.13]Oh shit, I can... I can back... I can back... I can back snipe this guy.
[260:06.07]Oh my god!
[260:08.11]I need his body.
[260:10.56]No!
[260:11.62]His body!
[260:12.60]His body!
[260:13.10]Come on, prisoner!
[260:14.50]Give up!
[260:37.92]One, two, three.
[260:45.29]I would have had it.
[260:45.87]Alright.
[260:49.59]I would have had it.
[260:50.23]I would have had it.
[260:55.25]Something quicker, the ship.
[260:56.27]What's all this fuss about the pier?
[261:04.34]I didn't listen to the guy.
[261:14.19]Why would you kick him forward?
[261:18.67]Oh my god, Riddick.
[261:21.75]That's the... Oh, he's stealthy, huh?
[261:23.71]Why would you boot him towards the people?
[261:27.52]That's the stupidest thing you could do.
[261:29.50]Oh.
[261:43.26]So we're going to not do any weapon.
[261:44.44]We're going to just break his neck with our bare hands.
[261:50.75]Oh, shit.
[261:51.99]No, I'm fine.
[261:57.77]Just kill me.
[261:58.79]Kill me.
[261:59.51]Kill me.
[262:00.47]Kill me.
[262:01.41]Kill me.
[262:02.52]Just do it.
[262:03.22]I can't believe it.
[262:25.78]It is kinda Kylo Ren, isn't it?
[262:35.38]Wait, climb up, somebody said?
[262:36.66]Holy shit, climb up!
[262:40.64]It's still dark!
[262:42.42]Nice!
[262:42.84]It's dark over here!
[262:44.98]Now what?
[262:45.50]Now what?
[262:46.04]Can I jump?
[262:46.42]Can I get there?
[262:46.92]Can I grab that?
[262:48.44]Oh.
[263:07.67]The bars, yeah, that's what I was trying to grab.
[263:09.35]I'm gonna wait till he turns around.
[263:11.07]Wait, hold on, I gotta... Trying to do the Batman attack.
[263:37.74]Am I actually supposed to do that?
[263:39.26]I grabbed the farts.
[263:54.23]There's no prompt though.
[263:58.59]Alright.
[264:00.13]No more hubris.
[264:01.63]No more fucking around.
[264:02.85]No more hubris!
[264:05.47]Just go on the bars.
[264:17.02]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[264:18.82]The pit.
[264:19.30]I know.
[264:20.44]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[264:21.74]It's wild.
[264:22.54]Can you believe what this guy Riddick did?
[264:23.96]Yeah, I heard if he takes his glasses off, there's a big red ray that shoots out of his eyes.
[264:30.89]What?
[264:31.33]What do I?
[264:31.89]Am I what?
[264:32.73]Do I drop?
[264:34.25]Oh my god!
[265:04.75]Everything was so blurry.
[265:08.57]I tried to keep going and he turned around.
[265:25.79]He has to be pretending.
[265:29.15]Adjust your TV screen.
[265:44.31]What happened?
[265:58.38]Who even shot at me?
[266:00.56]I don't... This guy?
[266:05.97]Dude, he just ripped through one of his teammates.
[266:08.07]He didn't even give a shit.
[266:10.27]He blew that guy away.
[266:11.51]He fucking murdered him.
[266:27.62]Uh.
[266:34.97]Oh, did he forget?
[266:50.73]Okay, now where?
[266:51.67]Dude.
[266:54.37]Okay.
[266:56.94]I don't understand why it's doing this.
[267:01.60]Press left.
[267:02.60]Left.
[267:03.80]Left.
[267:05.84]Forward?
[267:06.74]Okay, that's real dumb.
[267:08.90]Why would they do that?
[267:13.49]It's not left.
[267:14.21]You have to hold up.
[267:19.63]Where the hell am I now?
[267:23.48]Oh no, but what if I cannot see where I'm going?
[267:25.72]I've landed in a vault.
[267:27.46]I get to bring that one back from like 2017.
[267:31.76]Fuck.
[267:32.58]Where am I actually though?
[267:42.67]Up?
[267:47.57]I can go up, right?
[267:54.28]Who's gonna see me up here?
[267:55.20]Is this... Oh my god.
[267:56.90]Hmm.
[267:57.04]Nothing here.
[268:24.95]Oh, don't fall in there!
[268:33.24]Was that hard?
[268:34.10]Yeah, it was.
[268:34.96]Because I was trying to press up.
[268:36.66]You have to press up instead of left.
[268:39.82]And the whole thing gets blurry.
[268:48.19]Hey, look, this game was made in 2004, okay?
[268:50.35]It doesn't have the same quality of life improvements that we have in, like, 2020.
[269:13.26]You can see me in here?
[269:14.22]There's two.
[269:25.17]There's a guy in front of me too.
[269:39.83]There's a guy straight ahead.
[269:47.57]Fuck it, you know what I mean?
[269:48.59]Just go.
[269:49.07]Alright, guy up ahead.
[269:56.72]I need a repair kit thing.
[270:03.19]Should I jump?
[270:04.27]Oh shit.
[270:07.69]Oh my goodness.
[270:18.47]Should I wait for him to... Alright, I'm gonna try to go kill this guy?
[270:21.29]Should I jump down and break his neck?
[270:24.04]He might be the only one on there.
[270:24.88]I think he's the only one down here.
[270:33.81]I thought that was a person.
[270:35.57]Wait, should I go now?
[270:36.11]Should I just go now?
[270:37.59]I don't think I can.
[270:39.01]No, no, no, I'm gonna wait till he turns.
[270:42.57]This is the loser point of view.
[270:44.35]What'd you notice?
[270:46.07]You didn't notice anything.
[270:47.23]What the fuck are you talking about?
[270:48.97]You noticed what?
[270:53.77]Alright, motherfucker.
[270:56.57]I'm done with you.
[270:58.12]I've had it.
[270:58.76]Hmm.
[271:01.56]Nothing here.
[271:19.35]Don't keep looking.
[271:20.21]Okay, there he is.
[271:28.81]Just go?
[271:29.47]You can't just go.
[271:30.71]Do you see?
[271:33.29]Just go?
[271:34.57]Just go.
[271:35.15]Alright, ban that guy for life.
[271:52.57]I can run faster than the bullets.
[271:53.95]Fuck it.
[272:09.08]He's gonna ban him for life.
[272:14.66]Hey, don't shine that in my fucking face.
[272:17.02]Alright, this guy.
[272:17.68]I gotta... Holy shit.
[272:19.28]Okay, go, go, go, go, go.
[272:20.48]Get through, get through, get through, get through, get through.
[272:30.01]This is... You gotta go.
[272:32.63]Are you serious?
[272:38.18]You can do it?
[272:39.08]Well, I need a healing location.
[272:44.00]Okay.
[273:02.26]Alright, so there's a guy here.
[273:03.84]There's a guy here.
[273:07.58]This dude right here is a pain in my ass.
[273:09.84]And I can't get out of here without him hearing me.
[273:12.40]So I've got to be very quick about it.
[273:13.98]And I've got to Batman kill this guy.
[273:15.62]Are you ready?
[273:21.45]What?! !
[273:38.63]That was a tuber reaction.
[273:39.83]No, that was a- sure.
[273:41.03]That was really annoying.
[273:44.20]Whatever it was.
[273:47.78]Oh fuck!
[273:54.00]Why would you climb that?
[273:55.44]You guys wanted me to play this out hard.
[274:02.43]Oh no fucking way.
[274:27.13]Maybe I'm gonna go, I'm gonna make sure to go the other way.
[274:39.98]Okay.
[274:41.74]Um, am I lit up like a Christmas tree?
[274:45.16]Am I just, am I, can they see my eyes?
[274:49.84]Why can they see me from so far away?
[275:00.23]What's the game plan here?
[275:01.35]Do I have to get out the window or something?
[275:18.38]Just go.
[275:19.80]Don't listen to them.
[275:21.20]Alright, where is this dude?
[275:25.89]There he is.
[275:26.55]Okay.
[275:28.15]I wish I could quietly jump out a fucking window.
[275:45.56]The goal is to get to the other side over here.
[275:48.55]Is he still there?
[275:50.27]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[275:52.11]What the fuck was that turn?
[275:54.03]That was an instant turn.
[276:05.79]I'm ready.
[276:06.41]Hold on.
[276:07.63]I'm currently invisible.
[276:10.04]But is he still there?
[276:12.30]Oh my... The other guy's here now.
[276:14.76]Alright, this is my opportunity to go.
[276:16.52]Right?
[276:26.97]Fuck off.
[276:35.26]Oh.
[276:37.54]Is that guy facing?
[276:47.25]What direction is he facing?
[276:51.15]Did I save him?
[276:51.93]Alright, I saved him.
[277:05.64]Okay, thanks.
[277:06.08]Sharpshooter.
[277:38.45]There's a sharpshooter guard over here.
[277:47.98]Is that the guy?
[277:48.88]Can we?
[277:54.47]Got it.
[277:56.03]Okay.
[277:56.57]I have to make it past this without dying.
[277:58.81]Wait.
[277:59.43]I don't know what this is.
[278:01.49]Turn it?
[278:02.89]Gas!
[278:03.27]I don't know what I'm gassing.
[278:09.55]I got the card.
[278:10.09]Okay, bye.
[278:11.96]Hey, hey, hey!
[278:13.96]What are you doing?
[278:16.80]What's he fighting me for?
[278:17.78]I didn't do anything!
[278:18.50]What do you mean I aggroed him?
[278:36.36]What are you talking about?
[278:49.95]Wait, didn't I have to club out when I talked to him the first time?
[278:52.39]Okay, cool.
[279:05.47]Now what?
[279:13.83]Alright, place your bets.
[279:15.13]Is it going to crush me on the ceiling if I get on this?
[279:49.00]I just had to be sure about it.
[279:50.20]Alright, I don't think this... I really don't think there's fault image in this game.
[279:56.98]I don't think there is.
[279:57.54]Alright, just a little.
[280:08.05]Okay, so now from here... Right here.
[280:17.64]Lord.
[280:19.91]Oh.
[280:20.75]Right.
[280:21.37]Okay.
[280:24.35]That's... Third floor!
[280:35.25]What's that?
[280:45.42]You can go up even higher!
[280:51.95]Is anything up here?
[280:59.28]No?
[281:00.44]He's just here for no reason?
[281:03.82]Okay, well that's dumb.
[281:06.32]Mine entrance.
[281:22.92]Ventilation hatch.
[281:28.84]I think I just used the tool, right?
[281:32.83]Sick.
[281:35.01]What are my thoughts on duck meat?
[281:41.33]I don't really eat it.
[281:47.85]I'm not a big fan.
[281:58.42]What the hell is this for?
[282:30.80]Looks like a Half-Life map.
[282:39.84]Now where the hell am I?
[282:45.61]Alright, I'm... Is it an elevator?
[282:49.75]Do I get in this?
[282:59.33]Uh, okay.
[283:19.59]Deeper down to the mining core.
[283:24.27]This is not the mining core.
[283:32.42]So why did I go in this vent?
[283:33.68]What the hell did I go in the vent for?
[283:39.96]Is that like a shortcut to get back?
[283:59.29]He could have skipped all of that.
[284:03.33]Hey, James, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[284:04.79]Appreciate it, thank you.
[284:16.05]Well, it saved it again.
[284:16.99]Wait, there's a person out here.
[284:22.13]Did they not see that?
[284:23.29]He's gonna just fire a gun at me!
[284:25.87]Oh, God!
[284:32.36]This is the worst possible place to be right now!
[284:34.64]I can't get out there!
[284:37.00]I'm just a sitting duck, this is the worst!
[284:48.49]I can't even run!
[285:00.03]Okay, well now I- There's a guy here.
[285:02.53]Let's wait for the guy to go by so I don't kick the grate in front of him.
[285:10.66]He- He heard it.
[285:14.58]He doesn't care.
[285:15.82]Alright, where am I?
[285:16.40]Where am I?
[285:16.76]Where am I?
[285:17.10]Where am I?
[285:17.42]Where am I?
[285:17.80]I don't know where I am.
[285:18.54]Where am I?
[285:20.20]Where am I?
[285:20.58]WAIT!
[285:32.01]Is there a keycard on you?
[285:40.47]This is new?
[285:43.97]Oh, this sucks.
[285:45.70]Wait, there's a...
[286:00.98]Through like another dream tunnel.
[286:07.32]Where the hell am I going?
[286:09.96]What?
[286:10.16]What?
[286:30.62]I don't know where he is.
[286:31.55]Found him!
[286:32.67]He's up there!
[286:33.35]Oh, I... I'm leaning is... Alright, you know what?
[286:38.89]Fuck it.
[286:39.23]I'm going this way.
[286:43.81]Okay.
[286:46.49]What's up?
[287:01.33]Holy shit.
[287:03.92]I ground that guy up.
[287:06.08]I gotta turn the fan off.
[287:07.50]Wait, the fan's off.
[287:08.14]There's a body in it.
[287:08.74]Should I go in?
[287:17.95]Okay, I'm going in.
[287:43.84]I did it.
[287:47.82]Wait.
[287:48.89]Wait a minute.
[287:56.43]Wait, this is the fan the guy was looking... Why did that matter?
[288:02.46]Why did that matter?
[288:03.12]Why did he turn that fan off?
[288:08.24]Let go of the fan.
[288:09.32]What happened?
[288:16.52]Security?
[288:18.32]Wait, I was already in here.
[288:33.85]Am I fucked?
[288:34.69]Yeah, I think I am.
[288:39.26]Just run?
[288:41.60]Wait, did I went through the entire- was that like the exit you leave and when you're done?
[288:46.97]I can't just go.
[288:59.80]I can't just go.
[289:01.48]I can't.
[289:01.64]Go back to the elevator.
[289:06.85]Okay.
[289:11.66]So go back to the elevator?
[289:17.08]God damn it.
[289:22.63]Where's the elevator from here?
[289:24.21]Wait, dude, is that... What the hell am I even doing in the mines in the first place?
[289:29.51]What the hell am I doing here?
[289:30.63]Do I have a code for this?
[289:45.34]Can I get up there?
[289:46.40]Is there a way I can get up there?
[289:49.68]Like, jump up there?
[289:50.34]Because I want to be up there.
[289:52.78]Yeah, I'm fucking confused as hell.
[290:20.58]It also doesn't feel like that I have... It also doesn't help that I feel like I have a concussion when I'm playing this game.
[290:42.78]Star's D&D campaign was canceled today, so I'm going to peel off this sunburn and eat it.
[290:48.00]It's pretty gross, dude.
[290:52.04]Alright, we're back here.
[290:53.16]We're good.
[290:56.30]Didn't I kill this guy?
[290:57.12]Apparently not.
[291:08.61]Alright, we're back here.
[291:10.59]So now... I went up.
[291:12.35]I'm not going to go up in that vent.
[291:14.51]What is over here?
[291:15.17]This thing doesn't even...
[291:24.40]I have to go deeper into the mine, not climb around in vents.
[291:33.68]Go the other way in the vent.
[291:38.73]Yeah, people must think I'm really, really stupid.
[291:40.75]Because I'm not touching the guns, but I can't.
[291:43.25]Okay, so that's- we're going this way?
[291:54.26]That's just the door.
[291:57.14]I went in that vent right there.
[292:00.10]No, this is not right.
[292:14.61]Okay, so here we are again.
[292:20.42]Is there another vent?
[292:21.66]Can I climb anything?
[292:25.54]Because there's nothing here.
[292:26.34]There's a tunnel in between the vents.
[292:30.24]Wait.
[292:31.50]Hold on.
[292:31.80]Let me just check this.
[292:32.60]Because I just jumped right in after this.
[292:34.78]Surface panel?
[292:35.69]Oh, come on now.
[292:38.11]Come on now.
[292:50.96]I turned off the fucking fan.
[292:52.66]And now...
[292:56.98]He is pretending.
[292:59.88]I don't know how you would, like, know what to do here.
[293:09.32]Jump up on the fan?
[293:13.68]No.
[293:16.90]Down the fan.
[293:17.74]No, I went down the fan last time and it was a big mistake.
[293:21.29]There's nothing on... Wait, is there like a vent in the middle of the fans or something?
[293:30.85]Is there another way to go up here?
[293:35.55]Use the panel again.
[293:47.34]Go back in the vent.
[293:51.18]Is there another vent that I can go in that's not this one?
[293:55.07]Go back through the vent.
[294:02.05]Okay, this is... There's no other way to go.
[294:06.41]I mean, remember I kicked this and I freaked out?
[294:12.02]Wait, there's another... Wait, this is... Vent Andy.
[294:39.38]What?
[294:40.74]No, this is just... I'm... This is just where I was.
[294:43.52]I have no idea where to go.
[294:45.14]I don't know what to do.
[294:55.11]You can use the service panel to turn the lights off so you can get past the robot.
[295:00.12]Didn't I just do that?
[295:01.16]I just did that though, right?
[295:02.02]Hold on.
[295:05.68]I just did that, right?
[295:08.11]so technically I wait it's a lie okay guides don't hold on there's a guide what does it say is this gonna be like a screamer or something I'll be pissed if it is okay once you're yeah yeah yeah okay okay okay okay
[295:29.84]Okay.
[295:54.42]Check his body.
[295:54.88]There's a key card on his body.
[295:56.42]Alright, we're gonna go find Mosley.
[295:58.28]We're gonna go to the door on the left and find the key card.
[296:00.48]Wait, I already did that.
[296:04.09]Explore the upper balcony.
[296:13.06]Just watch the ending on YouTube.
[296:15.48]No!
[296:17.20]Where was that guy?
[296:22.81]This doesn't sound anyone near where I am.
[296:24.95]I'm not going to watch the ending on YouTube.
[296:33.15]Why would I do that?
[296:35.73]I'm going in the... Wait.
[296:37.90]What's this?
[296:39.10]What's that?
[296:40.80]I think this is like a vent I can go in.
[296:42.06]Look at this.
[296:45.80]There's two vents?
[296:46.52]No.
[296:48.88]The link was two or three pages.
[296:50.36]Wait, wait, wait.
[296:50.88]Hold on.
[296:54.50]Okay, there's the elevator.
[296:55.72]Oh, Jesus.
[297:07.43]This is... This is not right.
[297:09.41]Turn around and stand in front of the right elevator shaft.
[297:14.81]Wait for a small platform to appear above you and jump on it when it's close enough.
[297:17.55]You must not wait to be transported to a lower...
[297:24.36]Okay.
[297:25.56]We gotta go back to the elevator.
[297:26.78]This is all wrong.
[297:30.16]Back to that elevator and go down instead of up.
[297:39.38]Alright, where the hell is that elevator from here?
[297:41.04]Power, security, work, I don't know.
[297:49.28]Where's that fucking elevator?
[297:51.72]I have no clue where that elevator is.
[298:02.09]Nice map.
[298:02.99]Should I just start over?
[298:03.75]He doesn't know.
[298:11.56]Jump down the fan and go to the elevator.
[298:12.94]Alright.
[298:33.92]Are the elevators right here?
[298:34.92]I have to do this, right?
[298:39.62]What are you... What?
[298:48.73]Wait, no, no, I have to go this to the... Right.
[298:51.57]No, okay, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[298:52.81]But wait, does this take me to where I want to go?
[298:57.05]Through the elevator thing?
[299:00.31]This map is kind of a mess.
[299:15.34]Okay.
[299:16.48]Should I use it?
[299:17.18]Or should I climb up through the vents?
[299:21.42]You missed it.
[299:21.96]You're going backwards?
[299:23.90]Wait, what?
[299:26.46]Wrong elevator.
[299:29.18]This is the bridge you couldn't get the gun on.
[299:30.76]You were already here.
[299:32.23]I walked past it?
[299:33.41]What do you mean?
[299:33.93]How?
[299:40.45]I can't use this thing.
[299:51.03]You need to go to the elevator that you got squished in.
[299:52.67]Yeah, isn't it... Don't I have to go through here though and like stealth to the left and climb up that thing?
[300:03.32]Yeah, that's what I... No.
[300:05.38]Yes.
[300:05.98]No.
[300:07.54]You genuinely... I have no idea.
[300:09.52]Dude, I'm half blind and every vent is the same vent.
[300:21.42]And if I open this door, this guy instantly kills me.
[300:32.19]No one knows.
[300:38.55]Go up the elevator.
[300:39.55]Go up the... Well, this game is really fun until right now.
[300:49.97]So climb up this shit again?
[300:51.63]No, don't!
[301:11.69]You're going the wrong way!
[301:13.13]No, it's the right way, right?
[301:22.15]Don't go in the vent.
[301:32.96]Just go up?
[301:38.56]Go talk to vent Andy and give him the pack of smokes.
[301:42.65]He gives you a map.
[301:54.88]Dude, vent Andy.
[301:59.73]This has been such a mess of going in circles.
[302:01.97]I don't even know where that elevator, that one that I jumped on, the test squishing itself.
[302:06.65]I don't know where it is.
[302:18.02]Brink?
[302:18.34]Brink?
[302:21.77]Alright, if it's the... Why?
[302:28.05]I'm gonna go over here.
[302:30.35]And then... Watch the video of how to beat this.
[302:37.43]Hold on.
[302:50.35]Rickroll, but with a different link so people can't memorize it.
[302:53.15]That's hysterical.
[302:53.95]Thank you.
[303:15.82]Turn around?
[303:36.43]No, no, no, no, don't, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, where am I?
[303:39.79]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, everybody calm down.
[303:52.16]How am I gonna get into this vent?
[303:58.84]Go up behind you, I can't, how am I gonna do that?
[304:04.08]Go to the right end of it.
[304:35.93]Oh my god.
[304:41.49]Did I do that on purpose?
[304:42.75]No.
[304:43.59]I did not.
[304:44.29]I was trying to get the prompt to say to climb an event, and it wouldn't happen, and I can't jump in the fucking thing.
[304:50.06]Oh my god.
[304:51.60]Oh!
[305:24.88]He's not gonna beat the game?
[305:28.64]Well, in a... Alright, in a game that's about being not able to see anything, don't you think you'd want it to be pretty clear?
[305:36.23]No.
[305:37.17]Shit!
[305:37.85]That's completely the opposite of what we're talking about.
[305:40.67]In a game where you can't see anything... Ugh, whatever.
[305:42.93]I... It doesn't matter.
[305:53.68]I don't think I can even get over here.
[305:57.24]I'm really not sure I can get over to this.
[305:58.89]Do I have to- can I press like a button?
[306:03.33]You have to jump.
[306:04.97]No, I don't.
[306:05.77]Please tell me you're- You're fucking lying to me.
[306:09.03]You're lying to me.
[306:09.75]I can't believe it.
[306:10.51]I can't do it.
[306:11.29]I can't get in there.
[306:11.99]I'm fucking screwed.
[306:17.37]I have to go through that door where the big guy is and sneak over, but the guy just has a gun pointed at me.
[306:38.81]You know what?
[306:39.42]This... Charge!
[306:55.30]Just go.
[306:55.46]Holy shit, he's finally not looking.
[306:56.16]Don't turn.
[306:56.38]Don't turn, don't turn, don't turn, don't turn, don't turn, don't turn, donter, donter, donter, donty, dointeen doynteen dointy dointy dointy dointy!
[307:07.21]Yeah, that's right. Doynteen.
[307:14.21]Come on over here. Come on.
[307:22.21]Why don't you come over here and say that to my face, doynteen?
[307:30.79]Sick.
[307:32.93]Okay, good, good, good.
[307:48.18]I'm gonna finally get there.
[307:49.18]I'm gonna finally get there.
[307:49.86]I'm not gonna be softlocked anymore.
[308:03.27]Hey, go, go.
[308:04.81]Go, go, go!
[308:08.62]Go forward!
[308:09.90]Okay.
[308:48.84]Alright, I did it!
[308:49.80]Can you do a Vin Diesel impression?
[309:03.83]Wait, no, that's this part too.
[309:09.59]Oh, no.
[309:13.39]Remember this part?
[309:14.11]How much I hated this shit?
[309:16.11]At least one of these guys has to be... They're just in the same spot waiting for me.
[309:29.50]God damn it.
[309:40.19]He's still here.
[309:40.85]I know you've left probably for a while.
[309:42.45]And I know I progressed.
[309:43.97]But then I soft-locked myself.
[309:46.35]And I had to come back here.
[309:48.97]Oh, this is going to be impossible, isn't it?
[309:50.29]Just two guys just appear.
[309:54.56]Okay, okay, okay.
[309:59.00]Is it possible to... When they're right there, I can Batman both of them.
[310:14.18]They just saw me instantly.
[310:17.12]Riddick is the easiest guy to see, apparently.
[310:20.04]He's just really easy to see.
[310:35.80]Don't know how he didn't see that.
[310:37.62]Apparently, you didn't see me do that.
[310:38.96]He shot his own friend in the head.
[310:46.65]Thank God.
[310:57.66]Can you please come over here so I can just melee parry attack you?
[311:01.06]I want to get out of this zone so bad.
[311:06.34]I can't run for it.
[311:07.22]He'll kill me.
[311:09.44]Now he's running the fuck away.
[311:11.95]Where is he?
[311:15.23]My opportunity!
[311:22.43]Go!
[311:30.82]Here, finally.
[311:32.24]Finally, finally, finally, finally, finally, finally, finally, finally.
[311:34.98]Give me a... Yes.
[311:37.41]Oh, yes.
[311:37.93]Thank God.
[311:40.15]Thank God.
[311:41.19]Yeah, there he is.
[311:42.13]Remember this guy?
[311:43.15]This is the guy.
[311:43.95]Remember Mosley?
[311:46.47]Oh, yes.
[311:47.17]Okay.
[311:54.70]And then this... Cargo transport.
[312:05.46]For the love of goodness.
[312:07.80]Okay.
[312:08.44]We have to go down now.
[312:11.95]Time for progress.
[312:12.75]Game progress.
[312:13.53]Game progress.
[312:21.97]Jump down.
[312:23.41]There's not a whole lot of fall damage, but I don't want to just die.
[312:30.11]Oh, I can jump on that.
[312:43.09]Bad guy or good guy?
[312:43.77]What the hell happened to you?
[312:45.17]Yeah.
[312:45.29]I will take the tranquilizer gun for 30... I almost just said 30 quid.
[313:08.82]Nice.
[313:09.14]Okay, cool.
[313:09.52]Now, what the hell does this matter?
[313:10.92]Mining core, finally!

[314:25.45]Can I get a headshot from down here?
[314:31.13]Oh, I can.
[314:31.75]Can I tranquilize the guy in the suit?
[314:38.00]No, I can't.
[314:41.37]I can get the gun?
[314:45.51]No, you can't.
[314:57.60]Why is this guy walking over here?
[314:59.38]He's walking over here.
[315:00.22]Why?
[315:01.16]Why?
[315:19.72]Um, what do I do about this dude?
[315:37.60]I can't like smash the thing on his back?
[315:41.02]Turn it off!
[315:41.34]Turn off the light!
[315:41.82]Turn off the light!
[315:42.22]Turn off the light!
[315:44.38]I thought that just trying to see if I could like smash the thing on his back because it took one shot last time.
[316:01.40]Yeah, yeah, yeah body detected Yeah, yeah He's actually moving
[316:41.60]I guess we're... I don't know this way.

[317:14.53]Thank you.
[317:15.67]Alright, we're good.
[317:20.90]Pretty good progress.
[317:32.30]Ben to Andy.
[317:33.66]I can't even.
[317:35.89]I can't even.
[317:36.51]You guys are too much.
[317:37.43]Alright, so we got a ladder that way, but what's down here?
[317:58.66]super hard boss time upper mind sick no hold on but I did wait did I just
[318:16.96]I don't want to do that.
[318:18.92]This is the area?
[318:19.48]Yeah, this is the same area from last time.
[318:32.81]Not using guns?
[318:33.77]No, this game does this fun thing that makes it so it electrocutes you if you pick one up.
[318:39.29]So what, should I go up?
[318:55.15]I was already up here.
[319:00.18]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[319:14.52]The way that the big mech guy is walking is where I have to go.
[319:27.55]Big Mac?
[319:30.41]I didn't say that.
[319:31.13]I said Big Mac.
[319:40.10]Big Mac.
[319:41.76]Can I do anything with this?
[319:47.90]He's not even looking over here.
[319:57.86]What was deactivated?
[319:59.04]I'm gonna hide in this thing in here.
[320:18.35]My life support?
[320:27.94]Dude, where is this guy going?
[320:33.52]Is this technically in the dark?
[320:35.88]Okay, I have him now!
[321:17.82]You have to be the- I didn't do anything.
[321:23.30]I d- I didn't do anything.
[321:27.47]I stayed completely still.
[321:33.61]You didn't- I was crouching?
[321:34.79]Yes, I was.
[321:40.72]What was that explosion?
[321:52.71]Wait.
[321:54.11]What?
[321:54.65]What did I touch?
[322:04.94]There was a valve, so I pressed the valve.
[322:09.33]Why is everything an explosion?
[322:12.75]That doesn't make any sense.
[322:22.27]Is there a tripwire that I'm crossing?
[322:24.33]Val!
[322:44.93]What the fuck?!
[322:46.47]I don't get it!
[323:01.57]Why is that there?
[323:03.35]What is it there for?
[323:08.28]You're still alive?
[323:10.00]It's just impossible.
[323:14.16]Alright, I'm fucking out of here.
[323:17.06]Oh no, I'm not.
[323:24.74]so
[323:55.08]Okay, okay.
[323:56.22]I wasn't even close.
[323:59.68]Okay.
[324:01.58]Um.
[324:02.76]I can't open- I can't do anything with the panel.
[324:04.93]I don't have a screwdriver.
[324:07.41]Watch.
[324:08.53]Look, look, look.
[324:09.31]Everyone's screaming at me to open the panel.
[324:11.81]It doesn't do anything.
[324:13.71]Shoot the lights with a tranquilizer gun?
[324:15.43]It's not gonna do anything.
[324:17.69]Why is the electricity turning the lights off?
[324:20.01]Okay, watch.
[324:23.11]See?
[324:27.05]It doesn't do anything.
[324:27.71]It just turns off the rail defense.
[324:29.03]And I got lied to again.
[324:29.89]It's okay.
[324:37.31]No, I want to deactivate it.
[324:38.35]Can I climb that?
[324:50.48]Wait a minute.
[324:59.71]Explode them explode them good idea great idea Got it he's alive
[325:34.54]Okay, I'm gonna do it.
[325:37.32]I blew them both up.
[325:40.54]Oh, yeah, yeah, okay.
[325:41.84]Alright, alright, alright, alright, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[325:45.34]Listen, listen.
[325:46.44]I know I tried to blow them up because I thought the explosion was gonna fucking kill.
[325:52.32]I figured that an explosion was going to kill people.
[325:56.64]It doesn't kill anybody but me.
[325:58.11]I'm the only one it targets.
[326:00.03]Even if that guy's standing next to me, it doesn't do anything.
[326:02.15]Shut up!
[326:02.91]I'm talking to people.
[326:03.99]Leave me alone.
[326:11.13]Shoot the lights.
[326:21.92]Who cares?
[326:22.32]Let's go!
[326:39.53]Whose body?
[326:41.33]Wait, who the fuck is this?
[326:43.63]Get off of me.
[326:44.71]Uh, what?
[327:04.70]Something's going on here.

[327:36.19]Do I have to go up there?
[327:36.95]Okay, wait.
[327:44.27]Should I blow it up?
[327:46.11]I can blow it up.
[327:46.95]I can blow it up.
[327:47.47]I can blow it up.
[327:48.01]I should do it.
[327:49.23]Not yet.
[327:55.38]Where's the big guy?
[327:56.02]Where's the huge guy?
[327:59.58]Where's the huge guy?
[328:06.21]Your ass is mine, baby.
[328:18.66]I'm sorry.
[328:19.28]This is like top 10 ugliest games I've ever played.
[328:22.00]Hey, do you see that thing in front of you?
[328:27.18]I'm going to take a look.
[328:29.74]I've got a bullet with your fucking name on it, man.
[328:46.37]I'm gonna climb this shit.
[329:00.73]I'm not- No, don't tell me to go touch the valve.
[329:02.55]I'm not touching the valve!
[329:13.66]I can't climb this.
[329:14.82]Alright, I'm just gonna go this way.
[329:19.37]I'm good.
[329:19.77]I'm good.
[329:33.10]Friend or foe?
[329:34.00]Friend or foe?
[329:34.62]Friend or foe?
[329:36.42]It's, uh, um... It's the main character...
[329:43.02]I didn't kill him.
[329:44.26]I didn't kill him.
[329:44.66]I didn't kill him.
[329:45.04]I didn't kill him.
[329:45.40]He's alive.
[329:49.33]He'll get up in a second.
[330:02.14]You're Riddick, huh?
[330:04.40]I'm Jagger Valance.
[330:06.41]Perhaps you've heard of me.
[330:08.01]I'm not a very good listener.
[330:10.27]Where is this spaceport?
[330:15.84]Straight to the point, is it?
[330:18.04]Things down here work the same as up there, Riddick.
[330:20.34]This is Ron Perlman.
[330:23.30]Stop.
[330:24.18]You give, you get.
[330:27.19]You don't want to get what I can give, Jagger.
[330:29.91]It's that paper.
[330:35.21]I did this to him.
[330:35.81]Hey.
[331:03.98]I guess I'm gonna go put a chainsaw?
[331:18.30]Get into the sealed off area.
[331:22.37]Okay, I have him now.
[331:24.87]God damn it, man.
[331:27.01]Yeah, you like that?
[331:33.62]I have a shield.
[331:42.10]This is like a barricade.
[331:46.61]How did I miss that?
[331:50.05]Come out, come out, wherever you are.
[331:58.26]Good.
[331:58.78]Alright, we're good.
[331:59.90]Nice job.
[332:09.21]Look at all this shit over here.
[332:10.77]Shoot the lights.
[332:37.37]It's not a bullet.
[332:38.53]No, it's not.
[332:56.50]What was that?
[332:58.26]What was that?
[333:11.85]Dude.
[333:15.92]Okay, whatever, fuck it.
[333:26.99]I gotta kill this light over here.
[333:50.95]Swear to God.
[334:01.30]Whatever.
[334:14.45]I'm- I just tried, I couldn't.
[334:21.84]Can't get up this.
[334:23.96]Or this.
[334:25.38]Can't get up any of them.
[334:37.88]Anybody else in here?
[334:41.62]One guy.
[334:46.78]Oh god, oh god, that was, oh.
[334:49.88]That was not good.
[334:51.42]That was bad.
[334:52.04]That was very bad.
[334:54.03]That was gross.
[335:07.65]Jesus, what the fuck?
[335:09.37]Why are they just... Please tell me I have a checkpoint right there.
[335:13.36]What the hell is that?
[335:17.76]Why?
[335:18.20]Oh my god, you gotta be fucking- He's invincible.
[335:42.76]Why would they just put a guy just right there?
[335:45.78]It's not- like, why?
[335:48.31]I can't even stealth behind that.
[335:49.86]It's just, he's there and he's dead by shooting to kill you.
[336:04.98]Where's the other one?
[336:08.66]Oh, he killed this guy.
[336:19.99]Turn off the camera light thing.
[336:30.66]Oh!
[336:50.80]No meat grinder, sorry.
[336:56.12]Okay.
[336:56.98]Just... Where is he?
[337:07.15]Has to be dead.
[337:12.54]Yeah, everybody is.
[337:13.54]Good.
[337:14.02]Okay.
[337:28.22]Keypad.
[337:33.69]Oh.
[337:35.39]Keep... What does it say?
[337:37.24]Keep door shut at all costs ghastly.
[338:10.05]I hate this.
[338:10.73]This looks horrible.
[338:19.94]Just blow the... No, don't blow it up.
[338:22.50]Get me out, please.
[338:23.68]I won't make a joke ever again, I promise.
[338:25.68]Okay, we're good.
[338:53.75]Alright, package delivered.
[338:56.89]He's dead?
[338:57.31]No.
[338:57.63]Alright.
[338:58.17]What's up?
[338:58.53]Where are you?
[339:01.57]Hey.
[339:02.39]Alright, now give me the security code.
[339:03.81]You are as advertised, Riddick.
[339:06.77]Did you notice anything about the spot where you found the package?
[339:10.39]That small cave is actually right above the home of a breed of creatures.
[339:14.88]Large and vicious ones.
[339:17.60]It'd be chaos if something were to open up a hole.
[339:20.10]Alright, I'm probably gonna call it here.
[339:21.32]I'll need a bomb.
[339:25.17]I kind of want to play this though.
[339:26.25]I don't know why I want to keep playing this.
[339:32.73]Alright, you got it.
[339:35.92]Is there no fast way to get the hell out of here?
[340:00.00]Get to Tower 19 and get a bomb.
[340:02.18]Get to Tower 19, head back from the mining core to the mine entrance, then use the code to activate the elevator and go back up to the work pass.
[340:09.02]Oh.
[340:09.12]I just have to go all the way back.
[340:14.35]Yeah, alright, so here's what's gonna happen.
[340:16.55]You are so close to finishing one hour max.
[340:19.49]Wait, is that for real?
[340:20.33]Heck, no, that's not accurate.
[340:29.95]Is it true?
[340:34.09]Like, maybe 45 minutes.
[340:35.33]20 minutes.
[340:37.59]Is it actually true, or am I getting one god?
[340:39.11]Because I'll just finish it now.
[340:46.05]You may be, like, halfway through.
[340:47.53]Okay, I'm not gonna... We'll do this tomorrow.
[340:52.14]I'm good to go for three days in a row, I think.
[340:55.04]I'll be good for three days in a row.
[341:04.68]I think this game is actually pretty fun.
[341:08.38]Goofy.
[341:12.20]Why can I not say the word goofy?
[341:22.29]What about Saw?
[341:23.71]Saw 2 is going to be played.
[341:28.41]But, yeah, we'll do three days in a row.
[341:30.91]If I beat this within a couple of hours tomorrow, then I'll do something else for the time being.
[341:41.67]According to how long to beat, you've got about two hours left.
[341:44.75]Alright, well, we'll just do this tomorrow.
[341:46.03]We'll finish it up and maybe we'll do something else and just chill for like an hour or two.
[341:53.14]But for now, that's gonna be it.
[341:56.86]Stupid.
[341:57.42]I gotta figure out.
[341:57.98]I gotta tape this shit back.
[342:00.89]You won't beat this tomorrow, Dark Athena.
[342:03.59]Oh, that's right.
[342:05.61]Well, let's at least get to the end of Butcher's Bay.
[342:10.15]Assault on Dark Athena sucks.
[342:12.15]Well, we don't have to play it.
[342:17.15]But yeah, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[342:19.15]We'll finish this up.
[342:20.15]We'll maybe do something else.
[342:23.35]I'll see you soon.
[342:27.41]Look, if I'm still feeling it tomorrow, if I get to the end of Butcher's Bay tomorrow and it's like, yeah, maybe I'll just keep going.
[342:37.31]But that is the end of today.
[342:39.62]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[342:42.32]Bye.
[342:42.72]Take care.
[342:43.70]Thanks for watching.
[342:44.42]I had a lot of fun.
[342:47.10]I had way more fun playing this than I expected, so it was good fun.
[342:51.18]Here come the credits.
[342:53.90]These are all the subs.
[342:55.88]Every sub's in gifted subs today.
[342:58.60]Thanks to all of you, as always.
[343:00.54]There also was a... Somebody just dropped $50.
[343:06.90]Thank you.
[343:08.22]It was Gooberry Juice.
[343:09.54]Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[343:12.83]A big 5-0.
[343:16.93]And they say, please play this.
[343:19.79]Oh, you didn't, did you?
[343:22.29]Oh, yeah, you did.
[343:22.97]I'm going to watch this after the credits.
[343:30.36]Thanks, GooberyJuice.
[343:31.24]Seriously, $50 is a ton of money to give a streamer.
[343:36.20]Totally not necessary, but thank you.
[343:38.08]I really appreciate it.
[343:40.10]Thanks for the $50.
[343:41.72]And I want to say thanks to PeacefulHaley for five subs.
[343:47.03]Actually, PeacefulHaley gave 10 subs.
[343:48.27]And then 10 from James, and then 5 from Nate.
[343:49.49]Thank you, guys.
[343:49.93]Really appreciate it.
[343:50.83]What is going on?
[343:51.43]What?
[343:51.67]Do I still have, like, YouTube videos playing?
[344:21.24]Not delete.
[344:22.62]Hold on.
[344:23.74]Why did I not delete this from last time?
[344:25.62]I don't know why.
[344:26.16]I don't.
[344:26.86]What's wrong with me?
[344:28.82]I don't know what is wrong with me.
[344:30.94]I don't know why.
[344:31.83]I just turn the stream off and just fucking hold the power button on my computer down.
[344:35.29]Like, just take a minute after the stream and just clean it up.
[344:38.73]Like, what am I doing?
[344:39.81]Why do I do this to myself?
[344:51.30]Okay.
[344:53.52]Here we go.
[344:55.02]This is what you actually wanted to see.
[344:56.92]This is the Reddit.
[345:02.48]It's nothing to do with Reddit.
[345:07.58]My fucking chest hurts from laughing at this shit.
[345:12.57]I had to have a trial run to see if I really started laughing hard at something after coming back.
[345:21.09]Alright, here we go.
[345:22.57]You ready?
[345:22.85]3, 2, 1, play it.
[345:27.05]Alright, whoever is editing this video, I want you to take a second and whoever is editing this video.
[345:49.95]Fuck.
[345:54.16]I'll see you tomorrow.
[345:57.30]That was good.
[346:03.68]That was worth it.
[346:09.34]Thanks a lot, guys.
[346:10.30]I'll give you the link.
[346:10.92]Here it is.
[346:17.66]Good night.
[346:18.04]Goodbye.
[346:19.24]We'll pick it up tomorrow when we left off.
[346:21.52]Around 11, 12, same time we've been doing it usually.
[346:26.93]Good night.
[346:27.89]Goodbye.
[346:28.27]And we'll see you later.
[346:37.56]Take care.
