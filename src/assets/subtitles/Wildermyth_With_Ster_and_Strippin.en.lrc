[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.23]Alright, let's go.
[00:03.89]Welcome everybody.
[00:05.59]Hey.
[00:05.82]And guess what?
[00:06.60]I'm like five minutes early.
[00:09.32]It said somewhere around 12 to 1.
[00:10.46]Let's go.
[00:10.74]Here we are.
[00:13.20]Hi, everybody.
[00:22.73]Have you got a character in mind?
[00:24.36]Do we have like a whole race selection?
[00:26.66]I don't know.
[00:27.74]We're going to make our character.
[00:28.90]Your character is important.
[00:30.70]We can either randomize our characters, but I think it might be better if we make them.
[00:34.94]I think that's fun.
[00:38.82]Oh, I got to tweet this too.
[00:42.04]Okay, we got a couple options here.
[00:46.15]We have the age of Ulstrix.
[00:48.01]I think we should do that.
[00:48.67]That's like the standard campaign.
[00:51.94]Let's go with that.
[00:52.94]Sounds good.
[00:53.94]How do you spell this?
[00:55.44]Wilder.
[00:56.62]Is it not on the top left of your screen right now?
[01:02.94]Yeah, dude, I'm looking down at my phone and I'm like, how do you spell it?
[01:08.95]Oh, there it is.
[01:10.51]Okay.
[01:10.77]Wilder.
[01:12.83]Sounds fun.
[01:13.55]Okay, let's go.
[01:17.09]Okay.
[01:21.78]Right.
[01:21.96]So you guys should... Do you guys see the screen right now?
[01:24.24]Yes.
[01:25.36]Okay.
[01:25.64]So we're going to allocate one, two, three.
[01:30.07]You guys are now in control of your characters.
[01:32.37]So you want to... You can click them and you can start customizing.
[01:36.63]Ooh.
[01:36.99]Okay.
[01:38.07]So the top left... I click randomize once and I'm happy.
[01:41.37]Okay.
[01:41.65]So the top left, you can scroll along and you can kind of like auto people.
[01:48.25]And then you've got like...
[01:50.73]the bottom left is the most important and this is probably why you don't want to randomize stars because you need to customize your like aspects his name is alongus and it looks like me like I'm done I don't even have a chat okay you don't want to customize like any aspect of his personality you happy with him oh okay there's a whole huge there's a huge thing here okay
[02:14.38]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:16.32]So if you want to write a backstory, you can.
[02:18.60]Normally, the randomly generated ones are pretty funny.
[02:21.30]Okay.
[02:23.03]And then the biggest thing is you go to history, and you can pick, like, three traits.
[02:30.01]So you can pick, like, you know, potential, library, and brash.
[02:36.07]So this is pretty detailed then.
[02:38.45]Yeah, and, like, picking all this stuff will determine, like...
[02:43.57]It'll determine your character's directions, how he behaves, what might happen to him, the decisions he'll make, all that stuff.
[02:52.30]Okay.
[02:53.34]Is there... Where does your class come in?
[02:58.16]That kind of stuff.
[03:00.15]That comes in later.
[03:03.24]So, essentially, this is a RPG D&D AI roguelike that we're going to be playing, and it's in the same realm.
[03:11.85]Yeah.
[03:13.69]I just turned my stream on, and I haven't been talking, so... Yeah, relationship simulator.
[03:17.55]Okay.
[03:18.45]So, there will be combat.
[03:21.45]It'll be kind of, like, tactics-based.
[03:23.73]If you've played, like, Final Fantasy Tactics or a game like that, it's, like... It'll be, like, a...
[03:28.79]a top-down like hex like hex board and then the combat's pretty fun um but between the combat will be long periods of story and what we'll do is we'll voice our own characters and the ai will generate our dialog and our really what happens yeah why have I never heard of this game that sounds on that sounds this sounds amazing it's such a charming game but like not many people have heard of it okay
[03:53.93]Yeah, I kind of forgot about it.
[03:55.19]I've been wanting to play it for a while, and then I remembered, and I was like, oh, that does sound like a you thing.
[03:59.99]The forces are currently locked in.
[04:02.31]So if right now we've got Staris the hunter, and Gemma is the mystic, and I am the warrior.
[04:11.59]See where it says at the top, future warrior, hunter, and mystic?
[04:14.23]Where do you change that?
[04:17.07]I don't know if you can change it.
[04:24.51]I'm cool with being the mage.
[04:26.57]That's cool with me.
[04:28.63]If you want to be the warrior though, Stab, we can swap.
[04:32.33]No, I was just curious to what degree the character creation goes.
[04:36.27]I think it just gives you one of each and then we can assign them.
[04:39.96]Is there a hair color?
[04:43.62]Normally we can pick them, but this is like the base campaign.
[04:47.12]So it's kind of like... Oh, okay.
[04:48.42]It serves as a tutorial too, so we're like locked in.
[04:58.12]Alright, I think, I think that's, wait, should I have a beard or something?
[05:00.44]Alright, that's good.
[05:05.20]No.
[05:07.52]That's good.
[05:09.30]I did my history.
[05:10.04]What did you guys do for your history?
[05:13.10]Can you write in that?
[05:14.66]Yeah, you can if you want.
[05:16.16]Oh.
[05:17.52]Oh, no, I was talking about the, like, the three drop-downs.
[05:20.60]Yeah, I'm gonna do...
[05:22.03]I mean, destiny, shame, but also... I did dreamer, clown, and nostalgic.
[05:37.63]That, yeah, that sounds like you.
[05:39.79]I thought you said streamer.
[05:41.94]Streamer and clown.
[05:43.10]Streamer clown.
[05:47.40]Oh shit.
[05:47.76]Alright.
[05:48.04]I think, so the names are here.
[05:52.35]I'm excited.
[05:52.75]This is gonna be fun.
[06:04.32]Is there any other customizations?
[06:06.85]Jesus!
[06:08.29]Are there any other customizations?
[06:09.81]The way they said that, like, oh my goodness.
[06:12.31]Are there any customizations that we can do?
[06:19.77]I think you get more if we, this is like just the first campaign that kind of show you the ropes.
[06:23.99]Oh, we can do hair color and everything like that.
[06:26.43]Yeah, you can do hair color and all that kind of stuff.
[06:32.38]The main thing is the three aspects in history is like important.
[06:36.96]And then if you got to customize, you've got like size, color, head and face, and then your name.
[06:44.60]Man.
[06:46.01]if you could uh do character creator before you were born how long would you spend in it days that sounds like weird wait would you just hit the randomize button no I just named my character smushman but it was just like I don't know I already have that character name nine months yeah you got nine months of character creation yeah that's true
[07:10.41]What if, like, you had nine months, and then, like, you were one day from the nine-month limit, and you accidentally hit, like, randomize, and everything, all your hard work was just, like, undone.
[07:19.01]Like, bam.
[07:22.57]Oh, I forgot to save.
[07:25.54]Oh, that's not good.
[07:27.62]I'm just going to get born.
[07:28.72]Oh, I like that name.
[07:33.52]Inan Dogwood.
[07:36.40]Details.
[07:37.46]Okay.
[07:37.76]Alright.
[07:38.06]Well, this is just like a trial run we're doing, right?
[07:41.06]Yeah.
[07:41.94]Yeah, let's go.
[07:42.94]No, this is literally who you will be for the rest of your life.
[07:45.34]Okay, let's go.
[07:49.56]So it's going to generate our adventure.
[07:50.98]Welcome to Wildermyth.
[07:53.10]Okay, so the best way to do this is like one person will kind of be in control of when we go to the next slide.
[08:00.38]Okay.
[08:01.38]If either of you want to be that guy or you just want me to do it and then you just kind of read along.
[08:07.60]Hmm.
[08:09.56]I'm not ready for that responsibility.
[08:11.40]I think somebody should be like the bookkeeper, right?
[08:14.22]I'll be the guy.
[08:15.24]If you guys click read along with leader, that checkbox, then it will bring you with me.
[08:20.94]Perfect.
[08:22.22]Oh, we have our own little mouses.
[08:24.50]Yeah.
[08:25.36]So did you see the change page?
[08:27.25]Yep.
[08:28.79]Okay.
[08:30.51]There's room in it for another story.
[08:33.17]It's cold.
[08:33.99]I'm stuck here.
[08:35.71]Oh, this is you.
[08:36.89]Oh, okay.
[08:39.85]So you gotta read it.
[08:41.25]I'm trying to think of what I do for a voice for this person.
[08:43.66]Yeah, get in character.
[08:45.30]Have a feel for it.
[08:45.96]Center yourself.
[08:47.04]Figure out what you want to sound like.
[08:49.86]Audio.
[08:50.10]How do I turn the audio down?
[08:52.96]Alright, alright, alright.
[08:55.64]That's one thing he doesn't know.
[08:56.90]Anything.
[08:59.23]Anything.
[08:59.63]Should it be like a... Okay.
[09:01.13]Just make it you.
[09:02.31]Just be you.
[09:02.73]Anything to prove I lived, I guess.
[09:04.97]Not that.
[09:05.93]Not that I'm giving up.
[09:07.61]Someone will come.
[09:08.59]Maybe my friends.
[09:14.33]This is still you.
[09:16.29]Oh, I thought this was the narrator.
[09:18.11]But alright.
[09:19.41]This is how I'd started.
[09:22.53]Here in my yandering country.
[09:25.51]Something in the woods is very strange.
[09:27.46]I don't have any lines.
[09:32.82]A line?
[09:37.15]Concerned only with the depth and echo of his own thoughts, a young man named Inan takes the seasonal road to the town of Thunderost.
[09:44.09]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[09:46.27]His whole character introduction is... There's something going on in the woods.
[09:50.49]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:52.69]It's a timeless problem.
[09:54.49]The stone in the shoe.
[09:56.97]When should one bend and remove it?
[09:58.65]When is it finally time?
[10:00.34]Where's that threshold between discomfort and laziness?
[10:03.36]I could write a treatise, probably.
[10:06.36]Breeze is light that day.
[10:07.74]Birds are timid.
[10:09.58]In fact, the whole world is taking a breath, ready to leap in the sea.
[10:14.50]I'm there already, huh?
[10:16.28]Here's the hard part.
[10:17.29]Getting a longus out of bed.
[10:18.81]Or worse, if I have to dislodge him from a book or... That's smoke.
[10:25.33]Fluttering flames roost among the far-off rooftops.
[10:28.11]Inan hurries towards town, thinking of a longus, a young man whom he's known since boyhood.
[10:36.67]Okay, so now I can choose.
[10:38.55]You have to choose this?
[10:39.92]Yeah.
[10:41.56]I can choose to increase my rivalry, my friendship, or some romance.
[10:48.98]Let's do friendship.
[10:50.26]If we've known each other all our lives, I doubt we'd be rivals.
[10:54.08]He must have tried to cook breakfast again.
[10:55.64]There we go.
[10:57.76]Alongus, you alright?
[10:59.86]I'll get you out.
[11:00.42]Just make a little noise.
[11:03.37]Okay.
[11:05.29]Wait, what?
[11:06.85]So it looks like my introduction is a burning village, and I'm going to be in a solo combat situation looking for Along Us.
[11:14.99]So who is Along Us?
[11:16.39]Is that you, Ster?
[11:17.10]That's me.
[11:17.86]That's Ster.
[11:19.24]So the game has decided that we are childhood friends, just randomly.
[11:22.80]Okay.
[11:24.86]So now you can kind of get a feel for the combat.
[11:27.02]This is kind of the combat map, and it's all turn-based, and we all act at the same time, and then the enemies act at the same time.
[11:36.80]oh so she'd go pretty quick so this is along us his house this this yeah look his house is still standing at least along us fire right here you're not sleeping are you what's going on here this is me our longest he doesn't know why is no one
[12:03.96]Hey, do you not smell the... I smell the smoke.
[12:07.08]Get inside.
[12:07.80]Your bow.
[12:14.40]Yeah, my bow.
[12:16.98]The blaze is secondary.
[12:19.05]It's Doom's detail.
[12:20.81]A herd of these hideous, afflicted-looking beasts.
[12:26.63]Garoo!
[12:29.54]They stampeded in.
[12:31.26]I managed to trap one behind the house.
[12:33.88]Small victory.
[12:36.54]Staying in here, it's not really an option.
[12:39.91]Right, so.
[12:41.21]Here, I've got some tools around.
[12:43.37]You're stronger than I am.
[12:44.67]You can swing something pretty good.
[12:47.01]I bet we can at least drive it off.
[12:50.54]Okay, do I grab the pitchfork, the pickaxe, or the frying pan?
[12:53.86]I'm going pickaxe here.
[12:55.26]If it breaks stones, it'll break bones.
[13:00.10]It can be killed, right?
[13:02.40]If we're steady and methodical, we can manage it.
[13:06.37]Steady and methodical beating of an animal.
[13:08.87]Let's get it done.
[13:09.81]I hope it just cuts to me and I've been eaten.
[13:16.55]Our first enemy is a roe.
[13:19.45]It looks like it's just a deer.
[13:21.39]And we're going out the back of the house.
[13:22.91]So that's the end of my turn.
[13:26.87]I'm out of actions.
[13:29.88]You should be in control of your character right now.
[13:32.28]Okay.
[13:33.60]I will get behind you.
[13:36.06]Okay.
[13:36.60]With my bow.
[13:38.25]I'm going to open the door.
[13:40.69]And head out.
[13:42.37]Enemy revealed.
[13:43.05]Bow card.
[13:47.55]That's my turn.
[13:49.28]You have a shot?
[13:50.70]Nope.
[13:52.35]Your combat's gonna be really interesting, Gemma, because you're a wizard.
[13:55.07]What you can do is you can, like, basically, like, you click on the... Why did he go in the house?
[13:59.97]Why did he go in my house?
[14:01.27]Get out of my house!
[14:02.48]Wait, what?
[14:02.94]Come here.
[14:03.82]I'm gonna strike it.
[14:05.44]Oh, it's over there.
[14:09.46]Dude, where am I?
[14:10.36]Holy shit, you're so strong.
[14:12.86]The AI has written Jemma out of our story already.
[14:15.99]Okay, I leveled up so I can choose one of these three abilities.
[14:18.99]I'm going to go Sentinel.
[14:21.11]That seems cool.
[14:24.25]You're leveling up and you're in your room like, oh, I live near the forest.
[14:28.37]Yeah, I looked out my window.
[14:29.65]That's my whole story arc.
[14:30.95]You leveled up as well?
[14:32.57]Where's my level?
[14:33.29]I pulled Jemma.
[14:41.22]Everyone's saying, you guys gave me the unplugged controller.
[14:44.75]You're playing, dude.
[14:45.43]Trust me, you're playing.
[14:46.71]Oh, it's not my turn.
[14:49.61]Okay.
[14:54.79]Did you see that thing?
[14:56.37]What could have wrought such a change?
[14:59.30]Why did it go in my house?
[15:01.28]The creature's death is quiet.
[15:02.68]It seems to slip from life in a few stunned and hazy blinks.
[15:07.31]They'll spend a piece of the day getting the flames under control.
[15:10.05]The damage isn't as bad as it could have been.
[15:12.34]Townsfolk emerge from hiding to fight fires and clear debris.
[15:15.70]Some full of curiosity, others visibly haunted by what they've seen.
[15:21.70]We should go.
[15:22.68]Thomas is alone.
[15:23.82]Unless you think, I mean, I'm not sure who's safer suddenly.
[15:27.56]Who the hell is Thomas?
[15:28.94]Is that that kid that just sits in his window?
[15:38.82]This is you, man.
[15:40.68]I changed the line.
[15:42.50]Oh, okay.
[15:43.60]Oh, he did a little bit of improv.
[15:45.12]Let's start one out.
[15:46.30]Thomas will be waiting for us.
[15:47.84]What happened today could be happening everywhere, couldn't it?
[15:51.78]Something about that tower is just stuck in my mind.
[15:54.96]It's like when you get an apple skin in your teeth.
[16:03.08]Oh, some of these... It unchecked the read-along with leader, I think.
[16:06.90]Oh, okay, okay.
[16:08.51]Are you caught up?
[16:09.67]I know the sensation you describe.
[16:11.89]Huh?
[16:12.67]Yeah.
[16:14.17]Anyway, I just think... We said we'd meet him, so we should.
[16:17.26]The tower's in the hills.
[16:18.44]You've been there?
[16:20.30]Yeah, once.
[16:22.08]Actually, looking at the tracks, they come and they go.
[16:25.04]That direction.
[16:26.96]Oh, no.
[16:29.70]And on and along us follow the pounded path of the monstrous feat, hoping for the best and dreading every other possibility.
[16:39.97]okay this is so this is your choice here how do you tell who's choosing your the your character is front and center so it's not it's related to you if you have a rivalry with Thomas a friendship or maybe a romance a romance okay a worthless wild passes between them but the quiet only heightens their worry you've always been a little fond of him I thought of Thomas
[17:11.55]Have I?
[17:12.87]You've noticed?
[17:16.55]Is that true?
[17:17.93]I do find he's grown on me.
[17:20.64]Always kind of looking for an angle, a way to get ahead.
[17:23.96]He's not mean.
[17:25.10]There's just kind of this unapologetic self-interest with him.
[17:29.28]That makes me laugh.
[17:34.20]And plus, it seems like no matter where he goes...
[17:39.37]We tend to have adventures.
[17:43.63]Alright.
[17:44.27]Okay.
[17:45.05]So now our next mission is to find Thomas at the tower.
[17:49.69]It's kind of explained to us that the way we do this is we're going to scout the next area.
[17:57.14]And then it takes some travel time.
[18:00.70]And then sometimes we can be intercepted on the way, but most of the time we'll just travel there.
[18:04.64]And then we reveal and then trigger the next kind of chapter.
[18:08.86]He's not there.
[18:09.60]He said he'd be here on time.
[18:12.52]Previous night.
[18:14.54]The town where Thomas had arranged to meet Inanna and along us is a place he often used to escape to as a boy.
[18:21.10]He knows its rooms and floors so well.
[18:24.12]He could survive being chased through them.
[18:32.71]And now I wait, I suppose.
[18:38.36]The dust gets deep as rain puddles in here.
[18:42.26]Alive is alive.
[18:44.96]Until that beast breaks through.
[18:50.87]You're a rare beast.
[18:55.25]Folks would pay to see you.
[18:56.01]I'd pay not to.
[19:03.43]The tower is an heirloom of an earlier people.
[19:06.13]The locals have lost the legend of it.
[19:08.37]The emptiness is deep and fragrant.
[19:10.63]The odor of 10,000 rains soaked into the stone.
[19:16.36]But as the old will tell you, precious things go overlooked in a ruin.
[19:21.94]But lodges amid the bones of failure is often the dream that drove it.
[19:27.72]What's this over here?
[19:28.44]That book.
[19:31.20]Why have I never...
[19:34.95]easy there I guess you're wondering why I'm talking to myself beast I'm also wondering too Thomas bends down to pull it loose that don't that's me doing that the books I was gasping as the audience the book's heavier than its slight slender spine suggests it's it's the it's the game it's the game it's gone matter
[20:03.80]Look at this.
[20:06.48]It's full of strange stories.
[20:07.96]It's you.
[20:09.28]No, no, no.
[20:09.68]You want to narrate this?
[20:10.69]Go on.
[20:10.89]Go ahead.
[20:11.31]Oh, I thought I was reading it.
[20:13.73]Anyone can narrate.
[20:14.41]Alright.
[20:15.07]It's full of strange stories.
[20:16.29]The folklore of folk long forgotten.
[20:20.43]Candlelight leaping.
[20:23.51]Strikes no significant bell.
[20:24.93]It's the weird story of a child watching candlelight against the ceiling and wishing himself through it to a far realm without grownups.
[20:34.19]Wait, how old am I?
[20:37.09]What?
[20:38.33]Why am I reading this book?
[20:39.45]Why do I have this?
[20:42.55]Maybe you're an adult and you just want to go where there's no other grown-ups.
[20:45.94]Gift of the Inscriptor proposes an unlikely legend that one spider-limbed woman crafted all written language.
[20:57.54]She trapped ants between vellum and pressed them so long and relentlessly that they became letters.
[21:05.56]Mama Thunder roasts horn.
[21:09.52]Spins the yarn of a mother who drank so much and laughed so freely that she grew a beautiful spiral horn.
[21:15.33]Her children were very proud.
[21:16.55]Huh?
[21:24.83]I did that.
[21:25.47]This book...
[21:35.94]Something in him feels like it's coming loose, but he can't tell exactly what.
[21:40.54]What's happening with this?
[21:41.73]There's room in it for another story.
[21:43.83]Wait, did this just become a manga?
[21:47.61]I'm stuck here.
[21:50.60]But alright, this is how I'd start it.
[21:53.72]Here in my yandering country.
[21:57.43]Thomas writes, words are ready.
[22:00.59]Omens have formed in the fabric of everything, and he's beginning to recognize them now.
[22:05.06]Okay.
[22:06.20]Some are just misgivings.
[22:07.70]They've crept through his body like the sourceless aches one wakes with.
[22:12.02]Others are more substantial.
[22:13.74]Now, they seem lightning plain, a promise of thunder.
[22:18.74]Somebody just called me a theater kid and made me mad.
[22:20.51]Hold on.
[22:22.75]Time that person out for five minutes.
[22:24.69]From the wild black woods where birds once belled, a hateful silence churns.
[22:33.82]Pain lights Thomas's head.
[22:40.06]What?
[22:40.30]Oh, I'm fired.
[22:41.50]I made it.
[22:44.71]He lowers his bleary eyes.
[22:47.75]His story lies before him in luminous script.
[22:50.91]Empty pages have sprouted behind it.
[22:54.93]Why do I feel... powerful?
[23:01.86]Okay.
[23:02.20]What do you do?
[23:03.04]I pull out a spoon.
[23:06.38]Open wide, beast.
[23:07.36]I'm getting out of here.
[23:10.41]Alright.
[23:12.11]So, this is a... You're fighting a rager.
[23:14.15]This is gonna be a solo combat for you.
[23:16.39]Okay.
[23:18.48]It charges without seeing.
[23:20.13]And you've got actions.
[23:22.25]I believe you can still cast spells as a wizard with a spoon.
[23:26.83]Oh, that's right.
[23:27.23]I'm a wizard.
[23:27.75]Okay.
[23:28.49]Where is this beast?
[23:30.29]So you have to see him for him to appear.
[23:33.32]I don't know.
[23:33.98]Oh, it attacks scenery?
[23:35.92]Yeah, so what you can do as a wizard is you can basically imbue a piece of scenery with a spell, and then the following turn, you can throw the thing you imbued at the beast.
[23:47.81]So if you imbued a table or a fireplace, you could throw flame at the beast on the next turn.
[23:53.99]Oh, okay.
[23:55.19]So you can see how there's like a link that's attaching you to that scenery now.
[23:58.93]Yep.
[23:59.43]So you could probably spend your second action moving, try and get eyes on this beast.
[24:05.93]yeah there you go there it is okay now I'm gonna yeah grab it okay I'm throwing the fireplace you're gonna be throwing the flames oh fireplace
[24:24.76]I can't reach.
[24:25.58]Alright, I'm just going to move.
[24:26.88]I mean, this turn, you can move, or you can just end turn, and you can let him approach.
[24:30.14]Yeah, I'm going to get up here.
[24:32.24]Alright, there you are.
[24:33.00]Alright, now let's discus that.
[24:38.10]I'm wondering if... Oh, yeah, I have no idea.
[24:42.38]Oh, okay, so it has to be within these tiles.
[24:45.72]Yeah, yeah.
[24:46.52]So I think I could just... How do I get over to the beast?
[24:50.20]I think it's trying to get you to throw the bookcase at it.
[24:54.73]You can't target it, can you, through the rubble?
[24:57.27]I don't think so.
[24:59.05]Maybe it's just the end turn?
[25:00.45]Yeah, maybe end turn and see how he approaches.
[25:07.72]Alright, he's trying to break through.
[25:09.50]Yeah, can you imbue the... Maybe you can imbue the rubble in front of you?
[25:14.92]I think I just... Can I burn this?
[25:16.90]I just stole the fire.
[25:18.44]Possibly.
[25:18.84]Let me see if I can burn it.
[25:21.16]Okay, fire.
[25:23.22]Steal fire?
[25:25.15]Oh, maybe if you infuse something on his side, like the bookshelf.
[25:30.57]I can't target anything across this.
[25:32.62]Oh, okay.
[25:34.68]Should I start breaking shit?
[25:36.40]Yeah, just start breaking shit.
[25:43.42]He's going out the door, I think.
[25:44.88]Alright, hold on.
[25:45.54]Try to break the rubble behind you, maybe.
[25:47.68]Or infuse it and then throw it.
[25:50.23]What is withdraw?
[25:51.83]Stop in... Okay, hold on.
[25:52.86]Wait, wait, wait.
[25:53.28]I gotta... I'm gonna stop infusing this.
[25:56.08]And let's... Ah, here we go.
[25:57.12]Alright.
[25:57.44]I'm gonna use the papers table back here.
[26:00.78]There it is.
[26:01.28]Oh, good idea.
[26:02.10]Then... You should be able to... Splinter Blast.
[26:04.40]...attack him with it.
[26:05.14]Yeah, Splinter Blast.
[26:05.93]There you go.
[26:07.79]Alright.
[26:08.05]I get it.
[26:08.51]Let's go.
[26:09.31]Oh, nice.
[26:09.95]Okay.
[26:13.51]So, same deal.
[26:14.11]Turn again.
[26:15.19]Same deal.
[26:15.65]Infuse something nearby.
[26:19.03]Candles.
[26:20.84]And I'm gonna... Oh, let's just light the room up.
[26:26.62]Okay.
[26:27.95]I guess I'm done.
[26:29.21]I guess I've lit the fire.
[26:30.19]That's cozy.
[26:33.67]Okay, now if I... I'm gonna blow up the bookcase.
[26:40.95]There we go.
[26:41.57]Alright.
[26:42.13]See you later.
[26:43.41]Look at that!
[26:47.46]nice okay and Thomas I think Thomas is gonna level up there we go so you can choose from these three abilities and so read through them see which one kind of you like the look of elementalist ignite or open mind Thomas can interfuse with one additional target that means you can link two targets at once instead of just like the bookshelf you could do a bookshelf and a table I don't know
[27:17.09]Elementalist, what that kind of does is it improves the things you interact with.
[27:22.07]So if you interact with fire, it won't burn out.
[27:24.38]If you interact with wood, you get something called Splinter Salvo, which is like a better version of what you just did.
[27:29.92]I think open mine.
[27:31.28]I want to infuse with more stuff.
[27:33.00]Cool.
[27:33.12]Alright.
[27:35.20]Ooh, and I got a...
[27:37.08]You've got a little kind of amulet there.
[27:41.18]A strap of golden links.
[27:42.21]Everyone knows who's winning when you show up wearing this.
[27:43.81]It gives you bonus damage.
[27:45.09]So you can just click your empty slot and you can equip that.
[27:48.15]Oh, nice.
[27:48.57]Alright.
[27:48.91]Cool.
[27:49.91]0.7 bonus damage.
[27:51.61]This is pretty neat.
[27:52.23]I like this.
[27:52.59]This is fun.
[27:53.79]More monsters roam the battle halls and rattle the rotting furniture.
[27:59.07]but Thomas moves quietly, sensing his way in the dark.
[28:02.26]Oh, you're already dressed like a wizard.
[28:04.50]Daylight lands on his wrist.
[28:06.58]Cool wind soothes his tired eyes.
[28:11.16]I'm still allowed to live?
[28:12.44]He closes the tower door gently to make no noise.
[28:19.47]That was the mystic's art that I did, right, tower?
[28:23.63]Where'd I get it from?
[28:25.11]Could it have just happened?
[28:29.47]It's just one of those things.
[28:32.87]Things a man's born with that might blossom in his life when he needs them.
[28:36.99]Well, I might not deserve it, but you never turned down a turkey, so they say.
[28:41.01]I'm sorry, that guy calling you a theater kid is still Red Free in my head.
[28:47.39]Who never turned down a turkey?
[28:51.69]You don't.
[28:52.97]I bet this is you, Stan.
[28:56.27]Thomas!
[28:59.46]I should plumb the depths of this power, but safely, I suppose.
[29:01.82]And out of sight.
[29:02.42]I don't want anyone to know that I'm a magician.
[29:04.86]Thomas!
[29:05.94]You're okay.
[29:07.12]You're okay?
[29:08.38]You look like it.
[29:09.52]Hey, Thomas.
[29:12.81]Something happen?
[29:15.15]Alongus, you're here.
[29:16.61]And you're safe.
[29:17.27]Good.
[29:18.43]Oh, sorry.
[29:19.01]And you too.
[29:19.47]How do I pronounce it?
[29:21.65]Inan.
[29:22.23]Inan.
[29:25.83]Inan and I only barely made it.
[29:29.96]Yeah, see that smoke on the horizon?
[29:31.88]That's from the town.
[29:33.71]Yeah, that's thunder roast.
[29:36.47]It burned?
[29:45.91]Things are different than they were.
[29:51.40]Are they?
[29:52.86]Yeah, well, I don't know if you've ever seen something quite like this.
[29:57.60]A monster?
[29:58.98]Sure, we have.
[29:59.94]Yeah, we slay monsters.
[30:03.11]Oh, good.
[30:04.61]I'm glad you're okay.
[30:05.59]Well, I do magic.
[30:08.83]Yeah, I know.
[30:10.07]We're childhood friends, apparently.
[30:11.69]And our party has been formed.
[30:15.39]um so we discovered a new site so you can see in the region of the arnie vigil you can see that sword banner and that means that um there is a battle to be had oh a battle yeah so let's let's do it I do magic is there any information that might be pertinent
[30:42.12]Someone else narrate for a bit.
[30:47.37]A perfect understanding isn't likely to emerge.
[30:50.21]What these beasts are, where they came from, and what drove them to attack the town of Thunder Roast.
[30:55.05]But letting them nest here feels like the wrong idea.
[30:59.37]By the way, sorry, I thought that said chatter in the lower left, not clatter, so I was doing like a... Sorry, that's my bad.
[31:06.39]Do we fan out, get aggressive, or maximize our defense?
[31:09.51]Stay tight?
[31:11.06]sure well okay so either Ster can choose a curse as a suggestion or gemma can choose stoicism what what like I mean if one is him and one is me this is one of the things where we just kind of decide as a group this is like how do we want to approach this combat I guess we discuss okay back in my house it was pretty simple and we hit it one time or let them come to us
[31:40.85]I just came out of there.
[31:42.64]If we're methodical, patient, we can fend them off at least.
[31:48.98]No.
[31:51.88]He overpowered you.
[31:53.40]I know what's best here.
[31:54.58]Our modifier, we all get +2 damage.
[31:57.50]Okay.
[31:58.54]We have raccoons and roe as our foe cards.
[32:03.78]Alright.
[32:04.20]I guess I'm the tank, I think, so I'll approach the door.
[32:09.69]Okay, I'm going to... Oh, we can move on our own.
[32:13.30]We can move at the same time, yeah.
[32:17.50]Alright, I'm going to stay in the back.
[32:20.52]I'm going to... I'm going to get a fuse ready here on the tree.
[32:26.06]Just in case... I'm going to imagine they're going to be lured out potentially.
[32:29.50]Courage, Thomas.
[32:31.42]Courage.
[32:32.55]We must move forward.
[32:34.69]But not me first.
[32:38.41]And on.
[32:39.95]I mean, I'm very squishy, so I'm not going to get in there.
[32:42.48]Once you've used up your two action points, you want to just end time.
[32:49.10]Oh, there it is.
[32:51.78]You almost killed it in one hit.
[32:53.56]I had Sentinel, which is like an interception.
[33:01.51]I will rush the raccoon.
[33:03.27]Okay.
[33:04.93]I guess.
[33:06.07]I'm going to...
[33:12.31]I'm coming in.
[33:12.69]I'm just gonna come in.
[33:15.64]That's a good thing we got Thomas.
[33:19.30]Alright, that was good support.
[33:31.12]Great work, everybody.
[33:32.12]There's a little tutorial fight.
[33:34.34]We did great, everyone.
[33:37.58]Okay, we found Hunter's armor.
[33:40.63]Uh, armor two, warding one.
[33:42.75]Town watchers who are good with a bow and who can't get anything fancy have long traded to each other the secrets of Greybark.
[33:48.23]This is an upgrade for Elongus.
[33:51.00]Okay.
[33:53.80]The misshapen creature folds its bones and dives in a nice little neat pile.
[34:01.70]Blue fluids darken the dust.
[34:04.71]it's fascinating grim the color in their veins what does it mean a sickness probably today has put reality in a spiral kind of yeah day day drops day rises dusk is sweet the sunrise sweeter it's not long before they've cleaned the old tower up a bit there's still a thousand questions in this place excites
[34:35.88]Sounds like you've thought about this.
[34:59.23]Name the bands for cunts.
[35:01.57]We name our company.
[35:03.07]So my character suggestion is the Queer Crown- Walkers of the Queer Crown.
[35:08.38]Ster's suggestion is the Bats of the Fabulous Four, and Jerma's suggestion is the Family of the Golden Romance.
[35:14.04]What?
[35:14.84]Okay.
[35:16.20]The Family of the... These are all awful.
[35:19.18]Yeah, yeah.
[35:19.86]I don't think we're allowed to enter our name.
[35:21.14]I think we have to pick from our three.
[35:23.08]Enter your... Oh, the Bats of the Fabulous Four.
[35:27.07]I think that's my favorite.
[35:28.43]I like that because there's three of us.
[35:29.91]Yeah, because there's not four people.
[35:31.87]Let's do that.
[35:34.38]after that the three of them are inseparable rumors are rampant heroes are needed this world will be flooded in sorrows but its defenders are joined by a fire that night here follow the tales of the bats of the fabulous four be remembered that's us anime outro the game has crashed please send your logs oh no what yeah my game crashed
[36:03.61]That's an interesting prompt.
[36:06.00]Is that?
[36:06.76]Wait, no, I'm still here.
[36:07.70]Oh, you're here?
[36:08.90]You're good?
[36:09.24]Am I?
[36:09.48]Hold on.
[36:11.73]I think I'm stealing.
[36:12.75]A card of a raccoon on the screen.
[36:15.63]Oh, yep.
[36:16.03]I can see it.
[36:17.09]We're good.
[36:17.33]We're good.
[36:17.79]We're good.
[36:18.38]The way the combat system works is the longer our campaign goes, we'll add more monster cards to the list of calamities.
[36:26.40]And what that means is these monsters will... There'll be new monsters, they'll get tougher, and we'll encounter new things.
[36:31.87]And so the longer we survive, the more the calamities of the world will grow.
[36:37.23]Really?
[36:37.67]Okay.
[36:37.81]Right now, all we have is feral raccoons.
[36:39.74]So we're the problem.
[36:41.66]Yes.
[36:42.56]Okay.
[36:43.38]So, we have some choices here.
[36:46.20]We have some land around us.
[36:47.26]We have Cloudy Birch Wilds.
[36:49.04]We have Gruff Demon Woods.
[36:50.14]We have the Demon Wilds.
[36:51.20]We have the Humboldon Beaches.
[36:53.99]Two of these require us to build a bridge to reach.
[36:57.25]The other two, we can just kind of walk there and kind of scout the area.
[37:03.61]So, where would you guys like to go?
[37:05.19]What kind of sings to you?
[37:07.44]Okay, we got the humble demon wilds.
[37:12.82]Rough demon.
[37:13.94]More demons going on.
[37:16.15]The Cloudy Birch Wilds seems like the least demon-y place.
[37:20.73]What do you guys think?
[37:23.87]Um... I think Cloudy Birch would be the safe play.
[37:29.19]It sounds nice.
[37:30.53]Yeah, it sounds nice.
[37:31.37]What's wrong with my background?
[37:33.43]What's wrong with my walls?
[37:34.61]What do you mean?
[37:36.99]There's like holes in it.
[37:37.87]You've been punching it again.
[37:43.05]Yeah, you want a green screen?
[37:44.07]No, no.
[37:44.61]I think it's because you're seeing light come through the window.
[37:50.10]Wait, did that say 23 days?
[37:52.16]Yeah, so the time is passing in real time.
[37:53.88]You can see at the top, year one, spring, day 10, 11, 12, etc.
[37:57.92]we killed a raccoon and we're like we're adventurers now yeah 30 days let's go so we've revealed the cloudy birch wilds and it looks like there is a battle here to be had um okay assault moose landing stone I have to be honest I'm glad it's you cooking tonight along us my feet are so tired that my hands are starting to feel it
[38:26.53]Don't get too excited.
[38:27.69]Huh?
[38:30.59]They got excited!
[38:33.22]Huh?
[38:34.96]So, we'll hit Moose Landing Stone tomorrow morning, but that detour added more time than we thought it would, and our food is running a little low.
[38:45.60]How low?
[38:47.18]I've got onions and... some more onions.
[38:54.08]I still thought it was jerky.
[38:56.58]I figured we'd need that tomorrow.
[38:59.64]What?
[38:59.92]Ugh.
[39:03.24]Onions aren't a meal, they're an ingredient.
[39:08.36]Okay.
[39:09.24]So, we can either bet on me catching a fish, 30% chance, or along us changing my mind and cooking an excellent onion meal, which is a 51% chance to succeed.
[39:21.86]Well...
[39:23.05]Thomas, you settle this.
[39:24.41]Should I cook or should he go fish?
[39:25.95]We can't do both.
[39:26.47]Yeah, I think that's a good way to do it.
[39:27.49]The person not involved gets to pick.
[39:29.40]I think, um... I think that what we should really do is... I'd like to see if you can change his mind.
[39:35.70]I feel like onions could actually be a meal.
[39:37.56]If you put them into an onion soup and make a broth and make it salty and put a little bit of cheese on it.
[39:41.62]Let's do it.
[39:43.52]A good onion soup can hold its own against any other meal.
[39:48.60]Low and slow.
[39:50.51]That's the key.
[39:53.00]How slow?
[39:54.86]Start thinking of stories now.
[40:00.72]The version they tell in Cloudy Birch's Wild differs in one key way, you see.
[40:04.87]Because the agricultural significance of the... Later.
[40:10.25]And as I was astounded, there it was in the original document.
[40:14.11]Document?
[40:15.43]Even later than that.
[40:16.90]So, uh... How much longer do you think?
[40:20.74]Ugh, they're not doing what I wanted them to.
[40:26.35]I'm not sure if it's salvageable at this point.
[40:30.93]Sorry about the onion mush.
[40:33.41]What did you even do?
[40:34.31]No, it's uh... It's good, it's um... Okay, you're right, it's disgusting, but thanks for trying.
[40:41.60]You shall soon come to learn the tragic extent of my failings.
[40:47.21]Alright, we had a terrible onion soup.
[40:49.43]And then we got attacked.
[40:51.97]By enemies.
[40:53.01]Oh shit!
[40:58.25]Alright, they're in here.
[41:00.92]Yeah, most likely.
[41:02.78]Alright, let's get in there.
[41:06.36]Different tower.
[41:09.46]Wait.
[41:12.52]No, wait, where are they?
[41:13.30]There's three monsters in here.
[41:15.83]They're going to be in the back rooms, probably.
[41:20.87]Looks like Thomas go off on his own.
[41:23.09]I'm opening this door.
[41:26.47]Nothing in here.
[41:30.13]Oh, God.
[41:30.77]What?
[41:31.63]Oh, shit.
[41:32.49]I just started blasting.
[41:34.10]Hold on, wait, wait.
[41:34.72]Oh, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[41:36.48]Did I blast through the wall?
[41:41.08]Probably.
[41:47.07]Oh, God.
[41:48.97]Oh, shit.
[41:50.75]Oh, oh, it hurts.
[41:52.23]Watch out.
[41:52.57]Watch out.
[41:52.83]I'm going to throw a fireball.
[41:55.23]One eye goes dark like a candle prematurely snuffed and then fights the sensation that he's swimming, fights to stay on his feet.
[42:03.17]So I can choose to just die, dealing 12 damage to the enemies, or I can choose to fight on, but I will get minus 15 accuracy for the rest of the campaign.
[42:15.46]That's rough.
[42:16.04]Two of us get through life unscathed.
[42:17.66]Now's no time to give up.
[42:20.50]I've lost an eye.
[42:21.56]Anand feels his way back to safety.
[42:23.03]There's so much that he has to live for.
[42:24.75]So much ahead of him.
[42:25.75]If he can make it through today.
[42:27.31]An eye patch might add a dash of mystique to my luck.
[42:29.85]I literally lost an eye.
[42:31.29]Can you imagine saying that while getting attacked?
[42:33.93]Your eye pops out.
[42:34.96]Oh, an eye patch might add mystique.
[42:36.70]And your stomach hurts from gross onion mush.
[42:40.03]You guys are going to have to deal with this now.
[42:42.29]I'm gone.
[42:43.01]Alright.
[42:43.49]I think... Let me tell you something.
[42:46.31]Along us.
[42:47.15]I'm going to torch this room.
[42:48.93]I just want to make sure you understand.
[42:49.89]I'm going to... My eyes just went flame, right?
[42:52.86]And everyone's like, oh my God, he's going to use his powers.
[42:54.50]Finally.
[42:55.20]It's been like 45 minutes into the movie.
[42:56.94]Everyone knows I'm going to... Here it comes.
[42:58.06]Here comes the powers.
[43:01.74]Okay.
[43:02.74]So he's going to infuse that clothing rack and throw a t-shirt at the deer.
[43:09.44]So wait, do we... Do I have to hit done?
[43:13.20]No, this is a fresh turn.
[43:14.94]You've got two action points.
[43:16.80]Why are you dead?
[43:18.58]He fucking... I got hit by all three enemies and my eye came out.
[43:22.40]But you're not on the screen anymore.
[43:23.64]I don't think you want to move up on them.
[43:26.47]Thomas, do not run up there.
[43:27.57]Alonis has two armor, but you have no armor.
[43:30.19]Alright, you see the mannequins over here on the right?
[43:33.17]Yeah.
[43:33.61]Those have been infused.
[43:34.17]What we're going to do is we're going to pull them back and then I'm going to...
[43:37.48]Back in your talking character, boy.
[43:41.15]Okay.
[43:42.35]Flame eyes!
[43:44.39]Cross two.
[43:45.25]Stand back along us.
[43:47.01]I'll handle this.
[43:48.05]You step back.
[43:49.29]Pull them through.
[43:49.99]I'm pulling.
[43:52.87]I'm pulling.
[43:54.39]End your turn when you're ready, though.
[43:59.14]Okay.
[44:00.34]Push through.
[44:01.78]Aggressively.
[44:03.36]Step back.
[44:06.63]No!
[44:07.65]Okay.
[44:11.29]Flare!
[44:15.33]They're blinded.
[44:16.13]Uh... They will miss their next attack.
[44:21.51]You might want to line-of-sight the raccoon, though.
[44:24.82]Like, get away.
[44:26.94]You might be right.
[44:33.07]So you're ranged.
[44:34.15]Oh, sorry.
[44:35.73]Can you use that bow?
[44:36.45]Got him.
[44:38.53]Okay.
[44:38.67]What do I want to do here?
[45:01.04]CONSTRICTION POWER!
[45:05.24]He blocked it.
[45:07.14]Can you still move, pal?
[45:08.26]Maybe you get outside.
[45:10.88]Slow and methodical like you used to say.
[45:15.24]I can't move.
[45:15.82]I just tried.
[45:16.22]I did my... I used my power.
[45:22.54]Nice shot.
[45:24.57]Thundershot.
[45:28.63]I've got plenty of cover here.
[45:30.74]I'm still infused.
[45:32.46]Oh.
[45:35.54]Should we go hide in this room?
[45:36.46]We should probably hide in the other room.
[45:37.60]Oh, you're going in.
[45:38.23]Okay.
[45:38.63]I'm going to come in with you.
[45:40.03]My secret ability, Silk Step.
[45:45.43]Wait.
[45:46.47]Wait.
[45:46.83]Wait, what?
[45:47.63]How does this work?
[45:48.23]Wait, hold on.
[45:49.23]I'm reading my special ability.
[45:52.42]Oh, check this out.
[45:54.64]Hop.
[45:57.82]Can you kill it?
[46:06.52]Good block.
[46:08.18]I can't believe he's blocked twice and I'm the tank and I just lost an eye.
[46:13.30]I'm confused.
[46:13.94]Silk Step's supposed to make me hidden, but then it also told me to move.
[46:20.81]I don't know how my abilities work.
[46:23.53]Great job, Thomas.
[46:24.51]Let's find that eye.
[46:25.69]I let you have an eye patch.
[46:26.69]Look.
[46:27.99]Oh, you do have an eye patch.
[46:28.89]That's funny.
[46:30.69]Okay, we got the lizard beam spear.
[46:35.93]Um...
[46:37.59]I think I will replace my pickaxe with that.
[46:40.07]If I may.
[46:40.73]Oh, I get to name the item.
[46:44.59]So that's five damage, right?
[46:46.59]That definitely should go to you.
[47:01.04]And then we have a ring.
[47:02.80]Warding.
[47:03.96]Which is plus 0.8 warding.
[47:06.20]That's magic armor?
[47:08.83]The way gear works is if you hover over the empty slot for everyone, it will tell you the warding will go up from 2.1 to 2.9.
[47:15.95]So every value of one is like an upgrade.
[47:19.39]It says it absorbs magic damage.
[47:21.66]Inon, you should take it.
[47:23.12]You're tanking.
[47:24.90]Yeah.
[47:26.16]I'll grab it.
[47:30.36]you've been through hell my friend and the thought of you trekking back in this state is unacceptable I'm gonna make you some onion soup loot good you're still here alright who wants to play loot this is a new cat wait is this a new character they're just introducing us to an NPC okay hello
[47:57.67]Anon, this is Lute.
[47:59.73]She's headed back out of here, and I've arranged a slight detour for her to give you a lift back to town.
[48:05.33]It's just an eye, mate.
[48:07.53]Arranged?
[48:09.03]You mean you bombed her with some arsenal of reasons?
[48:12.37]They were extremely solid reasons.
[48:16.62]Huh.
[48:17.90]What?
[48:19.74]Just feels weird getting special treatment.
[48:23.02]Then think of it as balancing the scales a bit.
[48:29.28]You were in front of death's door not that long ago.
[48:33.35]It's time to enjoy the good fortune where you can find it.
[48:38.13]Take care as long as you need.
[48:40.89]You're sending me away.
[48:41.95]I'm being sent away.
[48:42.75]So in our first fight, I died, lost an eye, and now you're sending me away to like a home.
[48:50.15]What is happening to you?
[48:53.21]The treetops passing by, the bumping, that ox smell.
[48:56.74]what what what enemies improve their strategy okay so they've added uh the the deer are now corrupted and they leave trails of corruption when they move oh no okay so um
[49:11.08]I am... You're legit gone?
[49:13.20]Yeah, I am maimed, and it will take me some time to heal, so you guys are going to have to travel ahead of me.
[49:19.06]Oh, no.
[49:19.68]I'm actually returning back to Thunder Roast on a wagon.
[49:23.70]Why are we going the other way?
[49:25.82]Why did we send you back?
[49:27.94]Because I'm wounded.
[49:28.99]I lost an eye, guys.
[49:29.85]But we could go back with you.
[49:31.51]No, you chose not to.
[49:33.21]It's okay.
[49:34.05]Painted by the Amber by...
[49:36.65]Painted Amber by the fading light, a formation of stone catches Olongus's eye.
[49:43.03]You think something's up there?
[49:46.29]You never know what you'll find until you look.
[49:51.67]Hmm.
[49:53.75]Upon the hill's summit, nothing's waiting for you.
[49:58.35]Okay.
[49:58.57]Well, alright.
[50:00.11]Well, it turns out your eyesight is shit.
[50:02.61]It's a decent view, at least.
[50:04.41]Look, you can see the salt road.
[50:07.58]oh far in the distance I think that's our friend going back to town what's happening a thrumming what's that it grows louder a rumbling whoa and louder until the stone underfoot chatters and shakes it grows louder even more very loud oh it's so loud
[50:36.33]And that resolved.
[50:37.25]Okay.
[50:38.37]Okay.
[50:38.81]That was weird.
[50:41.33]That was close.
[50:42.75]Oh, hold me.
[50:43.35]Maybe we shouldn't have took all those drugs 20 minutes ago.
[50:48.59]Probably a bad idea.
[50:51.92]A voice.
[50:54.36]I am the one.
[50:58.72]The voice of a carnivore, cunning and crooning, warning them to run, promising to give chase.
[51:04.59]My eye.
[51:05.85]The one you have hunted so long.
[51:10.45]In my dreams at night, I would think of this animal.
[51:14.34]Through cups and riddles.
[51:17.40]That doesn't sound right.
[51:20.20]You have hunted so long for me and for a brotherhood that should be yours.
[51:30.44]wait can I go back yeah do you see your face Thomas in the back yeah I like know what's going on you're confused I'm like do you know my name her name it was the gift I gave to your ancestors Thomas is still tripping
[51:55.91]They walked my myth over green field and fallow, to the curves and corners of being they walked.
[52:04.81]Do you know my name?
[52:08.98]How would I?
[52:09.72]A blessing earned through ancient service, an oath written in the steps and trails, and sealed with a name.
[52:20.73]You need only to know it.
[52:25.11]I'll ask you once more.
[52:28.50]We don't know your name.
[52:29.78]We don't know your name.
[52:31.48]Do you know my name?
[52:33.80]I hope that's right.
[52:43.60]It's like reading a fairy tale from your childhood, only to realize how disturbing it is.
[52:47.70]The longest doesn't like knowing the name, but he's sure it's right.
[52:52.95]Sorry.
[52:54.31]Yes, I am Lokaikaias, your wolf god.
[53:01.33]And now you may take my oath.
[53:05.06]Abandon your humanity, my boy, and be blessed.
[53:09.34]Ah!
[53:09.88]As Wolfkind.
[53:11.76]Oh, yes, Locke, I, I, yes.
[53:13.86]I always knew that I was different somehow.
[53:17.01]A furry, perhaps.
[53:19.51]It feels like coming home.
[53:21.11]You choose to transform.
[53:22.89]Take an oath along us.
[53:24.31]No!
[53:24.67]I'm going home.
[53:27.03]Along us kneels, and beneath him are green-like pools.
[53:30.48]Dandelions rise yellow out of the sparse, wind-scraped dirt.
[53:34.10]They grow old and white, throw their seeds, and then wilt to nothing.
[53:39.96]The god rock he kneels upon hums.
[53:41.98]It cracks.
[53:43.00]Somewhere inside, a geode of understanding splits and catches light.
[53:48.77]Beneath the Earth and behind his eyes.
[53:52.51]Mildly.
[53:53.15]Somebody, like, took a picture of you.
[53:55.47]It's a flash on in, like, a bar late at night.
[53:59.83]We're going to get the anamorphs transition.
[54:04.97]Along us.
[54:07.07]Oh.
[54:18.52]plus four retirement age you have human arms you just have a wolf you have a wolf head that's it man when when I next see you I'm gonna be very confused oh no okay so um
[54:36.08]What we can do is you can head back to Moose Landing and you can secure it, and that will give us, like, a source of income.
[54:42.38]Oh, we can build a station here?
[54:44.12]Earn resources.
[54:45.72]Yeah.
[54:46.34]So you want to build a station in Pinewood?
[54:49.35]That's a good play.
[54:50.39]I'm running around chasing squirrels.
[54:51.99]What does Thomas do?
[54:53.37]Okay.
[54:54.19]Okay.
[54:56.57]Oh, no.
[54:57.65]This is going to... And you chose this fate, so you have to stick with it.
[55:00.84]Wait, do I have a... Hold on.
[55:03.68]God damn it!
[55:06.39]No, no, no, but you could- No, you have to.
[55:08.37]You have to go all out.
[55:09.23]But you know, you could do the wolf from every major RPG and that's just like this.
[55:15.07]Talk just like this.
[55:16.59]With a little bit of a little, you know, you don't really care that much.
[55:19.60]Labor intensive, but practical in the long run.
[55:22.34]I don't know how I got this accent.
[55:26.02]Should we lend a hand?
[55:27.62]I'm going Batman.
[55:29.74]The cowlings of Sleeping Top have been dreaming of building a new threshery or a lumberyard.
[55:34.74]The wild folk want to restore the woodland altar.
[55:38.10]Okay, so we can spend one of our legacy points, which we get a bunch for each campaign.
[55:42.38]We can build a threshery, which will provide us with wood and fabric, or a lumber wood.
[55:46.52]A lumber yard will provide us two wood.
[55:48.44]And a primal altar will give us hides and spell threads.
[55:50.60]And all this stuff can be used at the end of each chapter to craft new gear for us.
[55:55.67]I mean, I'm going to vote for the spell threads because, I mean, if you saw in the previous battle, my flames were very, very effective.
[56:03.81]Three damage each at least.
[56:06.05]Okay.
[56:06.61]Well, it's going to take 25 days to complete.
[56:08.83]Get to work.
[56:10.55]25 days?
[56:11.59]I'm healing all the while.
[56:13.17]Oh, okay.
[56:13.51]Good.
[56:13.91]Inan has returned.
[56:15.31]Okay.
[56:15.63]So while you guys are doing that, I will go to Moon's Landing and meet you there.
[56:19.98]Moose Landing.
[56:21.12]Okay.
[56:22.86]Your studies must be comprehensive and meticulous.
[56:27.16]I'm up to it.
[56:29.36]If no one else is.
[56:31.50]I'm so glad I'm not the wolf character and you are.
[56:33.36]We can investigate thoroughly to find a new item.
[56:37.59]We can prioritize speed for like crafting stuff.
[56:40.73]I think we find an item here.
[56:42.83]Yeah.
[56:43.33]I agree.
[56:43.91]Items are fun.
[56:44.93]Okay.
[56:45.21]Let's do an item.
[56:46.89]So this is my job.
[56:48.97]I will head there and find an item while you guys build that place.
[56:52.97]Cool.
[56:55.45]Altar dedicated.
[56:56.37]Longhorn altar now produces hides and spell threads.
[56:58.58]So you guys can probably come and meet me if you want.
[57:01.74]Yeah, do we have to do anything else with this or this just stays here?
[57:04.28]No, it's all done.
[57:05.20]Yeah, that'll be... That's good.
[57:07.96]We've liberated the Longhorn Altar.
[57:11.63]Alright, let's head over there.
[57:13.89]Okay.
[57:14.65]So now we just want to stay here and see this through?
[57:18.11]I think we see this through.
[57:24.04]If it's going to be adjacent to our altar over there, right?
[57:27.72]I think we should make sure it's secured.
[57:30.46]Oh, someone paused.
[57:32.81]uh infants infestations increase the strength of the source threat can ambush groups of two or one heroes it's dangerous out there don't travel alone or split the party at every opportunity okay we're gonna take the source out alright completed
[57:56.65]A thorough delving through the mysterious mysteries of the Moose Landing Stone has proven rewarding.
[58:01.29]It always strikes me how much history is to find, to know.
[58:04.41]I can't believe I haven't reacted to your wolf head.
[58:06.73]Yeah.
[58:07.03]Moose Landing Stone will return to the hands of the common folk, and while they tend it, this site will provide resources at the end of each chapter.
[58:15.33]Do we want hides, ingots, or spell threads?
[58:18.15]I say ingots.
[58:20.05]Like a bit of steel.
[58:21.81]I think it's useful for everybody.
[58:23.18]I think that's a good idea.
[58:24.44]Okay.
[58:25.58]Oh, we actually just get all three.
[58:27.46]Oh, we get it all.
[58:28.06]Cool.
[58:28.68]Alright.
[58:29.04]Nice.
[58:31.42]Who's still reading?
[58:32.12]Oh, there we go.
[58:32.68]Done.
[58:34.40]Okay.
[58:34.80]We unlocked a sash, which is a plus six stunt chance.
[58:41.61]Stunt.
[58:43.49]Stunt.
[58:44.23]That's like a crit.
[58:45.11]It sounds like... Yeah, it feels... I don't know.
[58:47.93]It doesn't even make sense then.
[58:48.97]Percentage chance that attacks will inflict additional damage and stunt effects.
[58:53.74]Oh, I think that's probably a wizard thing.
[58:55.76]It's crit.
[58:56.46]Oh, okay.
[58:56.76]Yeah, it's critting.
[58:58.93]Is it spell crit or is it just regular crit?
[59:00.45]It says attacks, so I would assume not spells unless everything's an attack, but I don't know.
[59:04.41]Oh, really?
[59:05.05]I don't know.
[59:07.03]I think spells are an attack.
[59:09.39]Yeah, people are saying ranger or mage would be a good choice.
[59:11.59]So either of you guys.
[59:12.75]Let's give it to Longus because he doesn't have anything yet, I don't think.
[59:15.25]Ooh.
[59:17.09]I mean, I did become a wolf.
[59:18.33]That is a thing.
[59:19.21]Yeah, you should be the ranged crit guy.
[59:22.46]But Thomas already has a... Yeah.
[59:24.28]We got you the silk threads.
[59:25.50]Alright.
[59:25.84]We're splitting it up.
[59:26.44]We're even.
[59:28.24]Okay.
[59:28.82]So now I think we head for the demon wilds, right?
[59:32.74]It's time.
[59:34.14]We're like really, really, really far.
[59:35.96]Yeah.
[59:36.80]Because I'm noticing we have a countdown timer at the top until things get awful.
[59:40.69]Yeah.
[59:41.35]Yeah.
[59:42.25]So, you know, it's a long journey, but, you know, worth it to save the world and such.
[59:48.09]Yeah.
[59:49.27]Okay.
[59:49.79]Yeah, I guess.
[59:50.95]Oh, no.
[59:51.41]So the Calamity has grown.
[59:53.21]We now get Gorgons, Watchmen, Bogmores, and Draven get extra health.
[60:00.51]Okay.
[60:01.79]So these are our legacy points.
[60:04.26]Yeah.
[60:04.58]I think it's like some kind of abrasion on the camera.
[60:06.82]I don't want to fight a Gorgon.
[60:09.84]Whatever it is.
[60:10.58]Like a glare on the lens, maybe?
[60:14.42]I'll get it figured out.
[60:14.96]Or we can just let them all through and see what happens.
[60:18.35]I don't want bow guys to be healthy guys.
[60:22.19]Yeah, I like that.
[60:23.95]I think we can handle the rest.
[60:25.81]Although I did get blinded by a deer, and I've never been the same.
[60:30.50]I can't believe you lost an eye.
[60:32.80]I know.
[60:33.20]Well, I think I'd rather lose an eye than just have a wolf head.
[60:38.51]That's all I wanted.
[60:43.32]Okay, the demon walls have been revealed and we have an assault on Swineside Copes.
[60:51.00]Okay.
[60:52.56]Okay.
[60:54.91]We're attacking.
[60:56.91]Alright, so would you like to be narrator now?
[60:59.03]Oh, yeah, sure.
[60:59.55]I'll narrate for a little bit.
[61:02.03]The sun's fallen and a silver fog floats from the trees where shadows pool.
[61:10.42]Wait, go back.
[61:11.46]I didn't even notice it at first.
[61:13.60]My little dog is on the left.
[61:14.90]Oh, you're just sitting there.
[61:20.93]Along us.
[61:21.83]Can you slow down?
[61:22.65]I won't want to lose you.
[61:26.85]You're gonna have to keep me on a leash.
[61:30.51]I thought that's what it actually said.
[61:33.79]You're gonna have to keep me on a leash.
[61:37.91]The quiet forms of fence around them, impenetrable.
[61:42.23]The whirling air almost utterly opaque.
[61:46.97]Inan!
[61:48.79]You trust me, don't you?
[61:50.96]Let's get to the trees.
[61:52.86]At least those are solid.
[61:56.46]They halt just inside the shelter of the pines, the dark air clinging wet.
[62:02.02]The trunks they press to dampen their palms.
[62:08.27]Being lost with you isn't so bad.
[62:09.67]I'm the one who's lost.
[62:14.24]You guys are together.
[62:14.96]And then suddenly, and then something vast moves beside them.
[62:20.40]Slow, achingly slow.
[62:25.62]It passes too enormous to be seen.
[62:28.67]Impossibly silent.
[62:37.64]It's a tree.
[62:38.66]It's just a regular tree.
[62:39.84]Some kind of beast.
[62:41.80]What's that Pokémon?
[62:43.90]Why are we looking?
[62:44.82]Who took this other picture?
[62:47.06]Tridaru.
[62:47.98]It's all AI generated.
[62:49.46]That's the crazy thing.
[62:50.54]Wait, so hold on.
[62:51.30]Yeah, it's like, oh, look at this.
[62:53.08]But look at this, too.
[62:54.02]This is a different, like, this is... They're trying to, like, really emphasize this really weird silhouette.
[62:59.99]Night's fallen.
[63:01.35]The fog wanders away, clinging to the felty outline of that gargantuan shadow.
[63:13.04]Let's find Inan.
[63:14.04]Maybe he saw it too.
[63:15.32]Maybe he saw it better?
[63:20.93]So, along with this choice, we'll probably put you guys in a two-man combat.
[63:24.31]Thomas's choice will find me first.
[63:30.73]I know you're beyond intrigued, but let's find Inan first.
[63:34.19]Bad night to be chasing moonbeams.
[63:38.51]Do you howl?
[63:39.55]Do you howl at night?
[63:42.97]Oh, I'm the theater kid.
[63:44.83]I'm the theater kid.
[63:46.10]You are howling every chance you're grunting and growling.
[63:51.06]you this before the more I do this there's another one for that Jerma during I become marginalized yeah yeah during the audition at the school play you went down on all fours and were running around on the stage for the wolf character and nobody else did that you want to know it's really cringe not giving it your all that's true they meet in the open along us
[64:15.74]Crickets crackle again, finding the rhythm.
[64:18.98]Somewhere, an owl pipes his blue notes.
[64:23.60]We're here!
[64:25.93]Apparently, Inan was also able to glimpse the shadowy giant as it passed.
[64:31.75]Didn't see more than a black suggestion of its form.
[64:35.39]I don't see a lot these days.
[64:39.07]Then, as they're about to decide whether to set up camp or search for huge tracks by starlight,
[64:45.08]The disturbance shakes the treeline.
[64:47.02]That's the treeline.
[64:51.41]Oops.
[64:52.51]What's happening?
[64:54.51]Okay, we all get plus one temporary hit points.
[64:56.99]You'll need it.
[64:58.09]We're probably going to need it.
[65:02.52]Okay, we have bogmores, ragers, raccoons, and rose.
[65:07.38]This bogmore is heaving its overgrown body in mucousy plops.
[65:11.04]Its grasping mouth drips and stinks.
[65:14.76]And that fire spirit, we've got to catch it.
[65:16.60]It says it won't be here for long.
[65:18.26]We have to catch this?
[65:19.30]If we catch the fire spirit, it will actually give us a legendary item.
[65:25.29]Oh, I'm up.
[65:25.71]I'm up here.
[65:27.03]Take that, squirrel.
[65:33.76]I'm gonna Sentinel just in case something comes.
[65:37.08]But we definitely, Thomas is still using a wooden spoon, even though we're in the second year of our journey.
[65:41.22]So we probably need to get him something.
[65:43.30]Yeah, why wouldn't I have just picked up a rock?
[65:44.84]It would have been better.
[65:45.42]Uh-oh.
[65:49.97]Okay, go for it, Thomas.
[65:51.29]Alright, how do I?
[65:52.35]I don't know if we have to kill it.
[65:54.49]Oh, there you go.
[65:55.83]Caught you!
[65:57.03]Do I get to make a wish now?
[65:59.45]Okay, so you can get a tier one fire wand or a legacy point.
[66:06.66]I'm assuming you want the fire wand.
[66:07.74]I mean, the wand has definitely got to be it.
[66:09.38]Yeah, for sure.
[66:14.52]Yes!
[66:16.12]Fire damage.
[66:17.10]Definitely replaced the spoon.
[66:19.25]Yeah, replaced the soup spoon that you've been carrying.
[66:22.27]Nice.
[66:23.93]Cool.
[66:24.21]And fire now has a stun effect of damaging up to three nearby enemies.
[66:29.16]Replacing gear is permanent.
[66:30.81]That's the stunt effect.
[66:34.39]Nice.
[66:34.67]Alright, cool.
[66:36.31]So now I'm kind of out of the combat zone, though.
[66:38.85]It's okay.
[66:40.29]I'm not going to push.
[66:41.05]We're just going to let him come to us.
[66:45.11]Good shot.
[66:53.83]Oh, shit.
[66:54.21]That's big.
[66:55.16]Whatever that is.
[66:58.01]Ow, not again!
[66:59.05]Oh, no, no.
[67:00.25]Is this on, like, masochist difficulty?
[67:08.37]I'm going to see if I can blow the tree up.
[67:11.27]Is it going to hurt you?
[67:13.56]I don't think so.
[67:14.08]I don't think you can friendly fire.
[67:16.00]See if I can pop both these.
[67:20.72]I actually can hurt you.
[67:22.86]Can I hit them both from here?
[67:25.00]There we go.
[67:27.92]They blocked it.
[67:28.52]I'm dead.
[67:29.36]No.
[67:32.48]I'll save you.
[67:36.74]Oh no, you're good.
[67:38.52]We live.
[67:41.04]No!
[67:41.54]Oh gosh.
[67:46.36]That thing is huge.
[67:47.34]This thing is terrifying.
[67:48.31]I think we're all dead, by the way.
[67:51.71]We need your magics now more than ever.
[67:55.74]uh I can try and finish off this guy I think I can I can pin this this person here I think if I do this all the bog more I can try it wait where am I moving him he loses his movement next turn that's good this plant sends out tendrils that grab and draw and in an enemy dealing damage and pinning them I'm gonna try it I could run I could run away after the fact yeah see if it works and you killed whoa
[68:24.43]All in a day's work, that's what I'm saying.
[68:26.37]I get a swift action free wolf bite, but I think I can't use it because I'm holding a bow.
[68:33.71]I think you can't use it because you're not in melee range.
[68:36.49]No, I was trying to do it to the deer when it was next to me.
[68:38.51]Okay.
[68:41.47]Oh, oh, it's okay.
[68:42.31]It's only Cardinal.
[68:44.49]This Raccoon is just going to keep shooting.
[68:45.71]Maybe I run off to him.
[68:48.47]I feel like that's probably less dangerous.
[68:51.13]You ran up to it?
[68:55.44]You want me to try and finish it?
[68:58.64]Ooh, that's actually helpful.
[68:59.92]Nice.
[69:00.94]Alright, we're okay.
[69:01.50]I wonder if I can reach from here.
[69:07.56]Yeah, I can't get to him.
[69:23.32]Alright, what if I do this?
[69:23.94]Hopefully this doesn't hurt you guys.
[69:25.58]What?
[69:25.76]There we go.
[69:26.16]Alright.
[69:27.08]That was big.
[69:27.52]That worked.
[69:51.80]I did not think we were going to make it out of that.
[69:53.16]That was good.
[69:53.64]Alright.
[69:53.94]We got a talisman of power, an ancient charm to hang around your waist.
[69:58.86]I think you should take this because you're going to be always up in front and you're going to always take hits.
[70:03.86]So you should be dealing damage at the front.
[70:05.32]I'm thinking maybe we should save something like I should wear like more tanky stuff.
[70:09.49]We should give you guys the damage.
[70:10.69]Give it to me.
[70:11.23]Give it to me.
[70:12.05]Give it to me.
[70:12.63]That puts a long us up to one bonus damage.
[70:14.95]So he would do one extra damage.
[70:16.65]I need one second.
[70:17.41]Can you guys hear me?
[70:18.47]Yeah.
[70:18.71]Yeah, we can hear you.
[70:19.95]Okay.
[70:20.25]Hold on.
[70:20.79]I think I like kicked my Wi-Fi or my router out.
[70:23.83]You're like breaking up a little bit.
[70:26.60]Wait, you actually physically kicked it with your feet?
[70:31.43]OK, let's just freeze it.
[70:32.27]You want to take like a should we take a two minute break or something like him?
[70:35.61]Yeah, we take a two second break.
[70:37.28]Yeah, maybe like two minutes.
[70:39.10]Yeah, I'll make some coffee.
[70:40.92]Cool.
[70:45.44]I'm gonna take a little break while Ster sorts his stuff out.
[70:47.81]You enjoying it?
[70:48.75]No, this is great.
[70:49.57]This is- I- I- I- So, for people that have no idea what's going on, I can- You can grab your coffee, because I want to explain in a little more detail.
[70:56.54]Okay, go for it.
[70:57.30]Go for it.
[70:57.94]I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
[70:58.78]Yeah, I think I kicked, like, the power cable halfway out of the modem.
[71:02.52]Really?
[71:02.88]So, my internet was, like, half out.
[71:05.36]It was weird.
[71:07.71]But yeah, we'll be back in two minutes.
[71:11.52]So just before I go BRB, we're just going to take a quick two-minute break.
[71:14.12]But for those of you that don't know what's going on, if you were like, what the hell's going on?
[71:17.44]We kind of jumped right into it because I was a little late.
[71:20.83]This is all AI-generated.
[71:22.71]So this whole game is a procedurally-generated RPG, AI, D&D-like...
[71:31.39]Not everything is AI and procedurally generated.
[71:35.37]I know, yeah.
[71:35.88]But a lot of stuff is.
[71:38.90]It's sort of just like a procedurally generated RPG.
[71:42.72]Not everything.
[71:44.00]It's not AI.
[71:44.86]Well, I keep saying that and it's stupid.
[71:47.18]That's the wrong thing.
[71:47.92]But you know what I mean?
[71:48.44]It's just like random stuff.
[71:51.84]That they plug in.
[71:53.74]RPG D&D for ADHD.
[71:59.18]If you're curious as to why is all this stuff so weird, it's because it's just generating it.
[72:07.25]And my camera, I have no idea why that was happening.
[72:12.11]I think it honestly was because the way the light was bouncing off the wall.
[72:18.03]I don't know.
[72:18.29]I'll have to figure that out.
[72:19.25]It seems to be gone now.
[72:21.98]This is really fun.
[72:22.64]This is funny.
[72:24.58]I'm going to take two quick seconds.
[72:26.16]I'll be right back.
[76:12.19]Yeah, hello?
[76:13.13]I'm back.
[76:14.19]Hey, welcome back.
[76:15.11]I'm ready.
[76:15.87]We're all ready, I think.
[76:16.67]We good to go?
[76:18.27]Yeah, we're good to go.
[76:18.99]I was thinking this game is so good if you, like, want to try D&D, but you don't have a friend who's a DM, because the game is the DM.
[76:26.05]Yeah, so can you correct me?
[76:28.31]When we were on break, I was talking about it.
[76:29.95]Is there a, is it AI?
[76:33.45]Yeah.
[76:34.07]Yeah, it's all, like, no adventure will be the same.
[76:37.25]It's, like, procedurally generated.
[76:38.51]There's, like, certain campaigns, but they have, like, not every campaign is going to have a wolf head and I'm not going to lose an eye, right?
[76:44.91]It's all AI.
[76:46.61]I believe, like, to an extent that there are, like, events that happen, like the wolf head, but it is still, like, phrased differently, I assume.
[76:57.47]The scenarios are written, but, like, what happens is kind of, like, all thrown into an AI and then, like, thrown at you.
[77:03.65]So it's just like a jumbler, essentially.
[77:05.93]That's interesting.
[77:06.43]That's cool.
[77:06.71]Yeah.
[77:07.71]So like certain stories, so you can see at the top, this particular encounter we found ourselves in is called Silver and Shadows, and it tells you who the writer is.
[77:14.76]So someone wrote this story.
[77:16.06]Oh, alright.
[77:19.00]But the AI kind of like puts everything in a timeline and then like, you know, throws the events at us and that kind of stuff.
[77:25.30]That's cool.
[77:26.13]Alright.
[77:27.11]You guys ready to go?
[77:28.63]Yes.
[77:29.37]Let's do it.
[77:30.89]Ahem.
[77:32.86]The fight has brought them back under the bows of the wood.
[77:37.12]I think it's quiet.
[77:39.02]I hate a night battle.
[77:40.38]Keep knocking into... I don't think it's pronounced bows.
[77:44.15]Can you stop, please?
[77:46.97]Keep knocking into trees.
[77:48.09]It's too late.
[77:48.93]They make a broad search for sign of the giant's passing, but are forced to camp precious hours from sunrise, having found nothing.
[78:02.86]Still, the story does quite well in taverns.
[78:05.89]And those who saw it dream of a colossal being, all shadowy, gray, silvery, fog, an overwhelming giant.
[78:13.95]They dream of seeing it again one day.
[78:16.65]They dream for years and years.
[78:20.35]I'm in the corner like, I'm above all this human stuff now.
[78:23.63]This is interesting.
[78:25.54]Three legacy points.
[78:26.86]Is this implying that we've spent years just hanging out?
[78:29.50]Yes.
[78:30.12]This might be a time skip.
[78:31.84]We just got a three-year time skip?
[78:37.86]We needed a break.
[78:38.96]Hold on, did we just spend three years telling everybody how cool we are for fighting in the woods?
[78:45.04]I think it's more like it's telling us, it's the narrator saying that this will happen for years to come.
[78:51.08]Like people will tell the stories for years to come.
[78:53.48]Oh, okay.
[78:53.70]We're still in our second year of our adventure, but he's kind of like saying people will talk about their deeds for years to come.
[78:59.19]Okay, okay, cool, cool, cool.
[79:00.17]Okay, so we can go to the Hallen Wilds.
[79:03.17]or the Night Top.
[79:04.97]Yeah, no, this is year two.
[79:06.33]So it was a time skip.
[79:07.59]Yeah, so we can, if you mouse over, the Hallen Wild seems to be infested with Gorgons.
[79:12.20]They may ambush our group.
[79:14.70]And the other one is Draven, which may ambush our group.
[79:17.71]Um, if we check our card deck again, our Calamities, by pressing B, or clicking the one in the top right, we can see that the Gorgons are kind of stacked.
[79:27.59]They are.
[79:28.17]And the Drowven look kind of weak by comparison.
[79:31.96]So it might be worth us going... Oh yeah, and we avoided the one Drowven once.
[79:37.20]Let's Drowven.
[79:37.76]Yeah.
[79:38.38]So let's go Drowven, because I think that's like the safer bet.
[79:41.34]Good idea.
[79:42.95]Because we are very injured right now, actually.
[79:45.19]And you'll see that we're healing over time as we travel.
[79:47.75]Wait.
[79:48.09]Two years passed and we're hurt?
[79:51.45]No.
[79:52.98]It was the narrator.
[79:54.18]It was confusing, but it was the narrator saying that people would be talking about our stories for years to come.
[79:59.02]But the top says year two, day 20.
[80:01.52]Yeah, that's our entire journey so far has been two years.
[80:06.19]Randomly generated.
[80:07.83]Yeah, it's, you know... I'm angry.
[80:09.23]Crime is traveling.
[80:09.97]Okay.
[80:10.42]Well, Assault Viv Mea Shop is our thing.
[80:14.22]I'm low health, but I think we can do it.
[80:17.86]We can also choose... If you see at the bottom right, you can see that we don't just have an assault choice.
[80:23.16]We have a patrol choice, which will send our party to clear the infestation on the tile and reduce the strength of the enemy.
[80:29.03]So we can spend some time just like kind of scouting.
[80:33.41]How certain are we going to lose this?
[80:37.38]It's strength 4.
[80:40.04]If we clear it, it'll become a strength 3.
[80:41.44]Okay.
[80:42.09]If we, like, patrol.
[80:42.93]Let's see if we can do it.
[80:45.15]Yeah, there we go.
[80:45.77]Okay, so now it's a strength 3, which is more doable, and I healed up.
[80:49.51]Perfect.
[80:50.29]So this is perfect.
[80:55.36]McCree!
[81:12.74]A little nervous.
[81:15.37]Click.
[81:24.07]Of course I'm tense.
[81:24.95]Moments before a battle, I get all squeezed up inside.
[81:27.37]I'm good.
[81:31.91]Yeah.
[81:39.10]What?
[81:40.40]We gain temporary damage of potency because you... Apparently my incredible, simple overconfidence.
[81:47.50]Yeah, through the power of your toxic masculinity, you put up a front that you guys were brave enough to deal with this.
[81:53.20]Hey, I appreciate that.
[81:54.22]Yep.
[81:55.30]I'm good.
[81:55.86]Yep.
[81:56.70]I'm good.
[81:57.02]Me too.
[81:58.16]Yep, same.
[82:01.99]Okay.
[82:03.85]So this is a small area.
[82:06.17]And darts.
[82:11.04]Should I... I think I'm kind of scared.
[82:16.61]I'm going to stay back.
[82:19.37]That scarecrow is blocking the path.
[82:21.57]Open fire!
[82:24.37]Oh my god!
[82:26.61]Nice!
[82:27.03]Okay, I'm going to... Yeah, I'll jump here.
[82:31.93]And then I'm going to sentinel if they get too close.
[82:35.00]I'm going to infuse the wagon if they walk near the wagon.
[82:37.54]Actually, let me see if I can do it now.
[82:39.34]I can.
[82:39.58]Alright, I'm going to do a blast.
[82:42.69]Let me do this again.
[82:50.35]Um... Actually, I'm just going to move.
[82:54.46]I want to get a better spot.
[83:01.54]I have never heard of a player being a werewolf and using a bow.
[83:07.34]Who has that fantasy?
[83:08.71]Turn into a wolf and just pick up a bow.
[83:11.39]Imagine a situation where you can identify an enemy location via your sense of smell.
[83:17.03]So even in pitch darkness, you're an excellent ranger.
[83:20.84]Yeah, I don't believe all the dogs are good at smelling stuff.
[83:23.38]My dog is an idiot.
[83:24.68]There's no way it's smelling stuff that I can't smell.
[83:26.72]Okay, but you're not a dog, you're a wolf, man.
[83:28.82]Yeah, you're a, you're a, well, you're a wolf, um, wolf head.
[83:32.22]I'm not buying it.
[83:33.74]I'm not buying it.
[83:34.90]Okay.
[83:35.70]It's propaganda.
[83:37.16]Gemma, how are you liking, uh, the wizard?
[83:39.26]It's fun.
[83:40.18]I like the, you kind of have to tap into scenery and then blow up scenery.
[83:43.52]I don't know if I'm, I don't think I have like a regular attack.
[83:45.74]Maybe I'm not close enough.
[83:47.46]No, I think this is it.
[83:48.58]Yeah.
[83:48.94]Yeah.
[83:49.34]I have a strike.
[83:55.88]Yeah.
[83:56.18]I forgot that you do like insane fire damage because you're warm.
[83:59.04]Yeah, that thing's crazy.
[84:00.05]I need to start doing that more often instead of blow up.
[84:03.26]Oh, I leveled.
[84:07.38]Inan Dogwood is now a Bloodhorn Warrior.
[84:10.08]Ooh.
[84:10.86]I can interrupt... I can upgrade my Sentinel move.
[84:12.96]I can go untouchable.
[84:14.72]When Inan gets a kill, the next attack against him within one turn will miss.
[84:18.50]That seems really good.
[84:19.60]That does seem great.
[84:22.58]Yeah, I really like that.
[84:24.02]Because I keep getting my ass beat.
[84:26.20]Ooh.
[84:26.50]A Fang Axe.
[84:28.08]Tier 1 Axe.
[84:30.63]Plus 1 damage to Dwarven.
[84:33.13]Feels bonus damage to Dwarven.
[84:34.49]Forged by long-dead roamers of the Wildlands.
[84:38.92]So we can either give this to one of you guys just so you have like an alternative weapon, or I can just take it for when we fight Dwarven.
[84:46.02]Is this better than what you have?
[84:48.44]I think it's about the same as what I have, but it has more shred and stunt damage.
[84:54.85]But I also have an empty weapon slot, so I can like carry both.
[84:59.51]Hmm.
[85:01.66]You don't have a melee weapon per se, so if you want something just in case something's in your face or you don't have any scenery to pull from, we can do that too.
[85:14.09]I think it's just go to... Do I do very much melee damage?
[85:19.26]I think the damage is dependent on the weapon itself.
[85:22.12]It says five damage on the weapon.
[85:23.66]And I think damage is just like... If you get plus damage gear, it would apply to everything you do.
[85:30.98]I mean, I'll take it and put it in my other slot.
[85:33.75]Yeah.
[85:34.41]If it's not better than what you have.
[85:36.49]No, it's the same as what I have.
[85:37.99]Alright.
[85:38.51]Yeah, that's good.
[85:40.35]Yeah, cool.
[85:40.91]Cool.
[85:41.77]And then we get the fern shadow pauldrons, which gives five dodge.
[85:47.03]You should dodge.
[85:49.57]I do not want to see another eye come out.
[85:52.64]Everyone say an Austin.
[85:53.52]Yep.
[85:55.67]Austin, did you announce it?
[85:57.05]Are these tanky, though?
[85:57.91]I feel like they might be a ranger thing.
[86:01.31]Just take them.
[86:02.53]And then if you get a tanky thing, we can trade it later, right?
[86:06.29]Gonna be flying in a plane simulation with Austin in a couple of days.
[86:11.91]It's gonna be wild.
[86:13.85]Go check the Twitter.
[86:15.09]I'll retweet that, too, in a minute.
[86:16.88]If only he dodged.
[86:21.93]We came out losing very little.
[86:23.63]Some rips, scuffs, and notches.
[86:25.75]But mostly clean.
[86:26.87]That's a worthy day's work.
[86:28.93]I don't know how I get.
[86:30.45]I don't trust simple successes or rationalism.
[86:37.29]Jesus Christ.
[86:39.59]You think of all the stuff that's out there.
[86:42.63]Evil.
[86:43.67]Yeah.
[86:44.61]Or just hungry.
[86:46.87]could come rampaging into our midst and take one of us away makes me frustrated how fragile we all still are someone asked if he was scooby doo
[86:58.97]Yeah, I was going to say you're getting into like, like, like, no, like ape territory.
[87:07.83]Like, I think it's just general beast.
[87:10.26]Yeah.
[87:10.50]General beast.
[87:11.10]Okay.
[87:12.12]I was a person before.
[87:13.38]I don't know what it is to be a wolf.
[87:14.94]You are quite close to just.
[87:16.54]Yeah.
[87:17.10]I'm more man than I am wolf.
[87:19.68]Okay.
[87:20.16]So the Draven got stronger.
[87:22.34]They learned from their defeat.
[87:24.46]Oh, but that's okay.
[87:26.32]That's their first card.
[87:27.78]So it's not a big deal.
[87:29.81]Do we want to secure the shop?
[87:34.55]Or do we want to press on?
[87:36.71]Does that mean we can buy stuff?
[87:38.85]It means we can get an item like we got last time.
[87:42.86]Secure.
[87:44.08]We're greedy.
[87:45.42]I say secure.
[87:46.60]Let's find an item then.
[87:47.88]I'm in the mood for some scaring discovery.
[87:49.52]We can set this place right as we go, can't we?
[87:52.26]Investigate thoroughly.
[87:53.24]Okay.
[88:03.12]Nice job.
[88:04.60]Alright.
[88:05.06]Secure complete.
[88:06.84]You look so happy.
[88:09.88]Study the world and you'll never finish discovering wonders.
[88:14.12]Looks like you guys are playing fetch.
[88:16.06]Yeah, it does.
[88:18.76]Somebody want to take narrator?
[88:22.06]So we've unlocked.
[88:23.40]No, I think you're doing a great job.
[88:24.72]Okay.
[88:26.64]So a thorough delving through the mysteries of Viv Mia's shop has proven rewarding.
[88:32.67]With me, a shop will return to the hands of the common folk.
[88:35.68]While they tend it, the site will provide resources at the end of each chapter.
[88:43.48]You've got two of these and one of those.
[88:45.30]Mm-hmm.
[88:47.12]Perfect.
[88:48.68]Okay.
[88:49.91]And then we click done.
[88:51.05]And we should get a weapon.
[88:52.35]There we go.
[88:52.81]Warding.
[88:54.07]A star slate necklace.
[88:58.09]Warding is absorbing magic damage.
[89:01.57]Probably you for being up front, right?
[89:04.25]Yeah, I'd go for it.
[89:07.12]Okay, so if you guys look in the top left of the screen, you'll see that Along Us is currently glowing and he has an icon.
[89:14.04]So that means that he has a side quest that we can pursue.
[89:18.18]Let's do it.
[89:18.70]If we click that side quest... How long has it been?
[89:29.31]I forgot how you, like, change the reader.
[89:33.15]Oh, yeah.
[89:34.05]Is it just when I press next, I, like, took it?
[89:36.24]Yeah, so we have to check the box.
[89:37.98]We're just reading along with you now.
[89:40.60]Haven't cracked a book in ages.
[89:43.12]How long since I've felt inspired?
[89:46.42]See, I'm more man.
[89:47.92]Well, you're turning into, like, Arthur Morgan.
[89:53.06]I've been through a lot.
[89:55.34]Along us?
[89:56.54]Why are you out here?
[90:00.39]Oh, you weren't supposed to find my note until tomorrow.
[90:03.73]Here, I thought I was being nice, letting you rest.
[90:09.58]Yeah, no, you are.
[90:11.48]I just... I wanted some time.
[90:15.38]Huh.
[90:21.27]I don't know what it is, really.
[90:25.35]Mind if I keep you company?
[90:29.48]I'm sure you can come.
[90:34.72]Okay, just let me get my travel things.
[90:36.22]You have any idea where we're off to?
[90:40.84]I don't know.
[90:42.24]Where are we going?
[90:44.32]I left you a note and I didn't really think beyond that.
[90:50.43]We have options.
[90:51.51]I need to spark my mind somehow.
[90:54.39]I need to become inspired.
[90:57.70]In that case, isn't the bar a good place to start?
[91:00.58]No, it's beyond the horizon.
[91:06.58]The face he gives at number two.
[91:08.68]Like, what?
[91:09.24]I didn't think of that.
[91:11.72]What are you doing?
[91:12.63]I chose the bar.
[91:13.77]Hold on.
[91:14.13]I didn't think of that.
[91:14.79]That was clever.
[91:16.67]Yeah, I love how your side quest is, let's go get a drink for like a half hour.
[91:21.01]I've just been running around in the woods.
[91:24.43]I can click it again.
[91:25.27]Oh, it's the same...
[91:29.23]Did we just complete it?
[91:32.79]I think you didn't.
[91:33.29]I think.
[91:33.77]Oh, I think you have to.
[91:34.80]You got to select one.
[91:36.12]Yeah, I did select.
[91:37.08]I think the selecting that one is making it.
[91:40.92]Because I'm choosing number two.
[91:42.20]Maybe the bar is like it's just ending your adventure.
[91:44.99]It's suspending the side quest because it's like you're not actually leaving on a journey.
[91:49.05]You're just going to the bar.
[91:50.67]Oh.
[91:51.91]Let's choose one.
[91:53.33]Okay.
[91:54.47]I guess somehow throughout this, I was just third wheeling behind you guys carrying like the wagon or something.
[92:00.44]That's so funny.
[92:01.92]I'm here.
[92:03.82]I know we're big time adventurers.
[92:05.00]Wow, look at this journey.
[92:06.02]Oh my god.
[92:08.32]We're going so far.
[92:10.08]We're going back to the altar where I transformed.
[92:13.30]Dude, this is like a seven month journey.
[92:15.94]Yeah.
[92:16.84]You guys are my best friends.
[92:18.22]Oh, no.
[92:18.60]Things got really bad in our absence as well.
[92:21.54]We have so many points.
[92:23.44]Let's just like just none of this.
[92:25.34]Yeah.
[92:25.94]You want to just cancel a little bit?
[92:28.08]Cancel?
[92:28.42]We're not fighting anything.
[92:29.88]Pass everything.
[92:31.02]Nothing happened.
[92:31.52]No calamities.
[92:32.30]We're fine.
[92:34.42]Why are we going all the way over here?
[92:35.98]So, what do you think of Brightmure Blind?
[92:43.76]Is that what this place is called?
[92:47.48]They say the brave who come here shall learn themselves the deepest truth.
[92:52.66]Well, one thing I've learned is to mistrust your vacation ideas.
[92:57.42]We've come this far.
[92:59.02]We've traveled a year out here.
[93:05.23]They didn't have the budget for me in this side story.
[93:07.81]Yeah, how come you're not here?
[93:09.69]I'm just carrying the bags.
[93:11.93]What are we doing?
[93:12.63]Grr.
[93:15.98]Uh... I'm trying to stay upbeat about this, but... Why do we even... Why do we do this?
[93:19.24]Is that really something you can search for?
[93:43.68]I remember when we were new at this.
[93:45.98]Everything was new.
[93:47.12]Each path we took and every labor we put ourselves to.
[93:50.22]I'm bored.
[93:53.12]You know what's really boring?
[93:55.35]Walking for a year.
[93:56.43]To find, to build a fire in the woods.
[94:00.41]And not fighting anything, not doing any adventures.
[94:02.67]We just go on a walk across the whole country.
[94:06.17]You know what's even more boring than that?
[94:07.87]Is doing the same thing, but neither of you spoke to me for a year.
[94:10.68]I just walked.
[94:11.80]Yeah.
[94:12.98]We didn't even ask.
[94:15.15]You just came.
[94:18.41]Tell me of sorrow this rose that you kept by the bed in which last your pole Isabel slapped.
[94:24.31]Why am I singing this?
[94:25.80]That's a theater kid.
[94:26.96]Why am I doing this?
[94:30.36]That song.
[94:32.02]What?
[94:33.74]She woke full of laughter and brightly she gazed the curve of her mouth in a kiss she appraised.
[94:43.92]Alright, I'm gonna count you guys in, okay?
[94:46.58]Three, two, one, go.
[94:49.12]She sang over the hills.
[94:50.90]It instantly voice jammered me.
[94:56.62]Take your headphones out.
[94:57.90]Wait, wait, wait.
[94:59.10]Sir, sir, take out your headphones.
[95:00.80]Okay.
[95:01.22]Ready?
[95:02.21]Three, two, one.
[95:04.47]She sang over the hills.
[95:06.27]Peaks are shy, but sure don't.
[95:09.57]And sure, as the sun rise, I'll someday be gone.
[95:12.72]But recall me, my love, and our joy may live on.
[95:18.70]And you do, and you do, and you do.
[95:23.90]That's a howl at the end.
[95:24.66]That has to be a howl at the end.
[95:29.74]And then we fused as one beneath the moonlight.
[95:34.86]the old love song is one he's sung a hundred times by a fire a hundred times with a friend and still tonight it feels new oh strange song always broke my heart a little when we sing it together are you guys forming a deeper bond of love I we might be I suppose we each thought of each other and what it would be like to have to go on alone
[96:00.28]is the relationship more akin to like a human and a pet dog or is it like I don't know find out a noise rises in the darkness not an echo of them but the resonant call of something else did our voices or wake the neighbors well there's been some run-ins out here stick by the fire maybe it's nothing if we're being hunted I say we turn the snares on her and I mean
[96:30.03]Okay, well.
[96:31.59]So my choice here is to let you guys stay by the fire with the guy with the fire wand.
[96:39.02]Ooh, good call.
[96:41.00]Or roll the dice on a Lagos hunting prey.
[96:44.72]I'm gonna stay by the fire for you guys.
[96:48.77]Aww.
[96:49.35]I wanna sing and I wanna kill and I wanna fuck.
[96:54.01]They stand back to back at the brim of the firelight.
[96:57.07]A foe emerges.
[97:01.19]Oh, shit.
[97:01.51]These look scary.
[97:03.03]Like, yeah, they're like necrobots.
[97:05.47]Yeah, they're like necrobots.
[97:07.45]So, wait, you have... You're here!
[97:10.61]So, I think these side stories normally involve two characters, but the whole pie comes along.
[97:15.51]Oh.
[97:20.95]And early on, he said he loved you, so you would have been, like, the guy.
[97:24.45]Alright, I'm fusing this.
[97:26.10]Yeah, I don't know.
[97:26.74]I think they're gonna actually... I'm going in.
[97:28.82]Oh, yeah, they're over there.
[97:30.92]Yeah, there's one on each side.
[97:31.88]Okay, I'll cover you then here and then we'll swap.
[97:37.58]I'm going to just pin this person over here so they don't move.
[97:43.38]Good idea.
[97:45.48]You guys can deal with that.
[97:49.22]Demolished.
[97:50.54]Good work.
[97:53.52]I'll get in front of you.
[97:55.94]I can just hurt it.
[97:58.51]Nice.
[98:07.16]Somebody still have an action?
[98:08.50]Yeah, hold on.
[98:09.16]Oh, it won't let me.
[98:18.49]Somebody said, I'm waiting for the walls of your room to fall down, revealing you're in front of a live studio audience.
[98:26.52]Nice work.
[98:27.30]Ooh, we might level?
[98:29.50]Yeah!
[98:33.48]Piercing shots.
[98:34.26]My ranged attacks have two pierce.
[98:36.58]Does that mean it goes through buddies?
[98:38.84]Passive bard.
[98:40.00]Alongus reduces the cost of recruit jobs.
[98:43.62]We've never done that ever.
[98:45.07]Yeah, I don't know what that is.
[98:47.09]One speed.
[98:48.09]Good upgrade.
[98:48.53]Howl.
[98:49.67]Howl.
[98:54.49]I'm a wolf.
[98:56.92]Oh, look at that.
[98:58.38]Warrior's armor.
[99:01.38]Yeah, I'll take it.
[99:01.96]Link mail.
[99:03.30]That looks pretty sick.
[99:06.95]It's not even my adventure.
[99:08.51]I'll take the loot.
[99:11.45]To my eyes, it's all clear.
[99:13.97]Same here.
[99:14.77]Nothing moving.
[99:16.59]Well, that we're shooting.
[99:23.52]Seems like we'll survive another night.
[99:27.76]You know, I'm glad we came out here.
[99:32.72]But let us be on the road again.
[99:35.58]Yeah.
[99:38.84]when you sang and when I sang with you.
[99:44.14]I consider to that word I tend to think of all the time.
[99:47.75]It's ration.
[99:50.17]It's like a well.
[99:51.09]This well inside you will always fill in empty.
[99:56.05]It's fine, but I want to live for the lasting things like love and old well-worn songs.
[100:06.61]In the morning, they will simply start home.
[100:09.97]If we walk all the way back, I will lose it.
[100:12.43]Just for clarity's sake, we could have done this anywhere like a year ago.
[100:18.51]We could have just walked.
[100:19.77]Longus convinced us to walk for a year to the birthplace.
[100:23.95]Oh, he leveled up from doing his side quest.
[100:27.67]He's going to live 10 extra years.
[100:29.65]And he now gets another move.
[100:31.43]I'm a blue-born hunter now.
[100:35.12]I can throw a trap.
[100:38.18]Uh, every time I kill an enemy, I can enter the gray plane.
[100:41.78]That's stealth.
[100:44.54]30 dodge.
[100:46.64]30 dodge sounds like a lot.
[100:48.35]It does.
[100:51.11]Yeah, and you already have the plus dodge stuff.
[100:52.91]Oh, and you can re-roll these with LP.
[100:55.39]Yeah.
[100:56.55]I feel like I'm not supposed to waste that.
[100:58.55]How much LP do we all have?
[101:00.49]It says at the 8 at the top.
[101:02.85]We have 8.
[101:03.63]So we share this as a group.
[101:05.63]Yeah.
[101:05.95]Okay.
[101:07.14]Yep.
[101:10.75]Did anything reroll?
[101:12.91]It gave me the same dodge again.
[101:15.01]Oh, okay.
[101:15.65]For a second I thought nothing changed.
[101:17.35]Wind Walk is like Misty Step.
[101:24.35]Like you'll be able to teleport somewhere, I think.
[101:27.41]Thorn Fang.
[101:30.43]Okay.
[101:32.05]I think we can go to the Hallen Wilds from here and just walk.
[101:36.01]It's only 20 days.
[101:37.49]Wait, when we're at the Hallen Wilds though,
[101:41.65]No, this is fine.
[101:46.55]Okay.
[101:47.55]Wow, we really did lose six months and 33 days on that journey.
[101:52.92]I can't believe we walked from just here all the way to here.
[101:56.30]I would like to apologize.
[101:58.32]For us to sing a song.
[102:02.44]Okay, Hallenwald has been revealed.
[102:07.49]This is a big world.
[102:09.85]Wait.
[102:10.87]Okay.
[102:11.21]So we can't actually... This is the last place.
[102:13.29]It says assault the Lithgram engine.
[102:15.61]We must achieve our other objectives first.
[102:17.43]So we must clear all the hostiles in the land.
[102:19.96]So we have to go to the other three places.
[102:25.18]Oh no.
[102:25.66]The only place we haven't been is Humble Demon Beaches, which is all... It's going to like be a year.
[102:31.32]It's going to be so far.
[102:33.82]Let's patrol this place.
[102:37.94]and get rid of the thorns, and then we will leave.
[102:41.58]Well, at least you leveled up a couple times.
[102:43.98]I tricked my party into taking me on a walk.
[102:47.11]Okay.
[102:47.47]A very long walk.
[102:48.65]How far is this trip?
[102:50.89]Okay.
[102:51.39]We're carving a pass all the way there.
[102:53.67]It's a commitment, but I think it'll bring us goodwill.
[102:56.25]Goodwill can buy you a lot in times of need.
[102:59.52]Okay.
[103:00.72]I guess let's get started and try and carve our way to the place we haven't been.
[103:04.88]Let's get started.
[103:06.76]Okay, 78 days it will take.
[103:09.41]Oh my god.
[103:10.21]Oh my goodness.
[103:11.61]We have to walk all the way.
[103:13.65]We lost nearly two years from your inspiration journey.
[103:18.49]I love this.
[103:19.64]We spent more time finding inspiration for you than we have on the rest of our quest.
[103:24.94]Thank you.
[103:25.68]You're good friends.
[103:27.62]Oh, God.
[103:28.28]Oh, no.
[103:29.42]Okay, so this is our first incursion.
[103:30.65]So Gorgons in great number move to attack our lands.
[103:33.03]Your enemies will travel from tower to tower, attacking and destroying all the sites until they are repelled.
[103:37.63]Okay, so what's going to happen is you can see their progress here.
[103:41.53]They're going to come from that land through Arnie Vigil and then Thunder Roast.
[103:46.40]So should we just set up shop in Arnie Village?
[103:50.10]Yeah.
[103:50.58]That's the best.
[103:51.26]Probably the best idea is to set up shop in Arnie and then intercept them.
[103:54.96]Or we can just keep building this bridge and then like follow them.
[103:58.76]Either.
[103:59.02]Wrap around.
[104:00.29]Yeah.
[104:01.01]I'm down for whatever.
[104:02.33]Yeah.
[104:02.55]I think we can intercept them, right?
[104:04.47]That's probably safe.
[104:06.31]Yeah.
[104:09.75]That's secure.
[104:11.41]Okay.
[104:11.77]Do you want to find an item while we're securing?
[104:14.67]I think we should work faster with the whole incursion situation.
[104:18.75]Yeah, okay.
[104:19.43]Okay, that's good.
[104:23.30]Yeah, let's just take everyone off of this.
[104:25.50]Yeah.
[104:26.88]And go.
[104:27.58]Yeah, because they might just be on their way over here now.
[104:31.46]Yeah, see that?
[104:32.28]See how it's filling up with... Okay, do we want to cancel all these?
[104:34.69]No, I think we can handle these.
[104:36.19]I think we're alright.
[104:38.39]We don't want to waste all of our points.
[104:40.36]yeah we're strong oh no look at that whatever this is what's this gorgons gorgons is terrifying yeah oh my god what counter is this oh it's a raging gorgon okay okay so we're dead everything's no everything's fine we've got this we're gonna crush this we've been killing everything
[105:01.31]Arnie Vigil has been cleaned and put in good order with time left for a few days of comfort.
[105:08.18]Arnie Vigil will return to the hands of the common folk while they tend it.
[105:11.48]The site will provide resources at the end of each chapter.
[105:16.20]Hides, ingots, spell threads.
[105:20.06]Never carve in the past.
[105:24.46]I think it's... You know what I mean?
[105:27.66]Yeah, I don't know how...
[105:32.42]Are we building a bridge so the enemy can use that bridge?
[105:35.02]We're not doing that, are we?
[105:36.99]Yeah, I think we are.
[105:38.45]Why are we helping them?
[105:40.55]It's fine.
[105:42.13]What else are we going to do?
[105:43.51]They can't get over here.
[105:45.07]We're helping them get over here.
[105:47.54]Well, yeah, they're beasts.
[105:48.92]Maybe they'll swim.
[105:49.74]We don't know.
[105:51.70]Okay, so now we have to stop what we're doing.
[105:53.94]Well, they got here before we finished.
[105:55.86]We didn't finish the bridge.
[105:57.20]All heroes on this tile will fight.
[105:59.20]It looks like we have four farmers helping us.
[106:01.70]What?
[106:04.60]The Gorgons have come.
[106:06.56]Silence falls, emerging in their tortured shapes.
[106:09.91]The beasts only breathe and blink their oozing eyes.
[106:15.91]How should the defenders respond?
[106:19.22]Along us, I... Okay.
[106:23.16]Charge into battle and fight them.
[106:24.54]Use our knowledge of the land and Harry their approach or stay here until the last moment and fight with cunning.
[106:30.88]I mean, my vote's going to be on that.
[106:32.65]Hyde, we'll just jump out and surprise them and then we'll get the jump on them.
[106:37.47]Any excuse to play hide and seek?
[106:39.53]Yeah, he loves hide and seek, dude.
[106:41.75]Is it...
[106:42.92]Concealed amid their surroundings, they elude the frustrated eyes of their enemy.
[106:46.98]Choosing the moment to strike is up to them.
[106:51.08]Wait for it.
[106:56.50]Okay, we all begin in stealth and we have flanking attacks.
[106:59.84]Nice.
[107:02.34]Oh my god.
[107:04.38]There are so many enemies.
[107:07.52]So I think we are actually going to be controlling the farmers too.
[107:12.54]I think.
[107:15.06]Alright, there's one up there.
[107:17.20]Are there any in this room or no?
[107:19.83]No, no, no.
[107:21.39]I think they're going to be coming from the top of the screen.
[107:24.17]Oh, no, they're not.
[107:24.65]There's some below us too.
[107:25.89]Oh, shit.
[107:26.35]Where?
[107:26.73]Oh, yeah, they are down there.
[107:27.59]Alright, I'm going to make my way over there.
[107:30.98]Okay.
[107:32.02]Oh, God.
[107:32.54]Okay.
[107:33.54]There's a huge guy over here.
[107:34.50]Oh, there's a lot.
[107:35.74]Oh, wait, where?
[107:36.84]On the right.
[107:38.32]Down by me.
[107:39.66]Oh, yeah, I see him.
[107:40.26]You want me to move to intercept?
[107:42.68]We should probably prioritize this guy because I think there's enough... We have barricades, right?
[107:48.77]Sacrifice as many villagers as you can.
[107:52.25]Are you throwing the villagers at the... Oh, fuck!
[107:57.33]I didn't mean to do that.
[107:58.47]Oh, okay.
[107:58.99]Yeah.
[108:00.13]I thought I was... Alright, alright.
[108:01.81]We're okay.
[108:02.83]We're okay.
[108:03.35]I didn't realize I had all control of these people.
[108:07.17]We just can send them anyway, really.
[108:09.30]We have control.
[108:13.99]Yeah, use them to block the barricades.
[108:16.93]Yeah, yeah.
[108:18.49]Oh, no.
[108:19.27]Oh, my God.
[108:21.45]Oh!
[108:21.65]Wait, what?
[108:22.27]They just jump over it?
[108:23.18]I intercepted him.
[108:24.28]Nice.
[108:24.60]Uh-oh.
[108:29.36]Okay.
[108:30.90]They come from inside the houses.
[108:32.30]Oh, my God.
[108:33.46]There's so many.
[108:36.14]Uh... Okay.
[108:39.97]I...
[108:42.23]I'm gonna infuse the cart.
[108:46.41]I'm gonna try to do some damage over here.
[108:48.08]I'm gonna double infuse it.
[108:50.06]No, I'm not.
[108:52.08]See if I can hurt these guys over here.
[108:56.94]Shit, it's not far enough.
[108:57.84]Oh, there we go.
[109:04.32]That didn't hurt that much.
[109:09.32]Wait, which one did you hit?
[109:10.10]Oh, that guy over there?
[109:11.14]I'm going to move except the big guy, I think.
[109:16.55]Okay.
[109:22.29]Blocked.
[109:23.93]He's going to eat you.
[109:24.61]Let's bring this guy down here.
[109:28.82]Yeah.
[109:31.40]Good shot.
[109:31.76]Good shot.
[109:36.11]Oh, no.
[109:37.63]No kidding.
[109:38.45]She's gonna die.
[109:40.71]There are a lot of people down here.
[109:42.27]There's four enemies down here.
[109:43.55]How many are up top?
[109:44.69]There's two?
[109:45.65]One?
[109:46.81]There's one left.
[109:48.34]Thomas got grabbed!
[109:49.10]Uh-oh.
[109:50.84]What do I do?
[109:52.38]Can you run?
[109:53.02]Are you rooted?
[109:54.32]I don't think... Am I not?
[109:55.16]I don't know.
[109:56.14]I can't get over there.
[109:59.52]Can I go in the door?
[110:01.62]Can you... Yeah.
[110:03.10]Open the door and then run through.
[110:04.92]Alright, I'm out of here.
[110:07.08]I'm not fucking with that.
[110:08.54]Yeah, you guys do have like a Shaggy and Scooby vibe going on.
[110:20.34]Shit.
[110:21.16]Why did I shoot?
[110:22.26]Oh my god, I'm an idiot.
[110:25.20]Okay.
[110:30.12]There we go.
[110:30.52]Alright, I feel a little bit safer.
[110:32.96]Hard to tell who hasn't done things.
[110:37.12]That's right.
[110:38.22]If someone hasn't acted, it would just jump to them once you've had the turn.
[110:41.66]I think their portrait is kind of lit up.
[110:46.51]Let's get Katie to safety.
[110:47.69]Is that right?
[110:54.21]Uh-oh.
[110:57.74]I don't think we're... Oh, no.
[111:00.04]That's bad.
[111:03.25]okay can I throw that whole barricade at them or something I can't select the barricade let me see if I can just let me walk back over here okay I can alright I can I'm gonna try to throw the barricade like you said alright uh blast what's this do alright I can do this this is gonna hurt a lot
[111:34.15]nice although I did get rid of the barricade I feel like that's bad I don't know if that's a good idea or not we turned our defense into offense oh my god there's a giant furnace I'm gonna put her in front of you so you don't die yeah I need to move towards this fire because I want to pull up next turn wait what nice oh he was on touch books they killed him cool
[112:03.99]Uh-oh.
[112:04.43]My blindness.
[112:05.79]I can't select this.
[112:06.69]Shit.
[112:07.23]Sorry.
[112:12.92]Ooh.
[112:20.22]I love how the mage just kind of breaks objects in the world and throws it at people.
[112:29.88]Holy shit.
[112:31.83]Actually, that was... We did a pretty good job.
[112:34.45]Yeah, that was really good.
[112:36.07]Oh, Thomas.
[112:38.68]Level up.
[112:40.50]Thomas has grown stronger.
[112:41.84]OK.
[112:46.80]I like this one.
[112:52.68]Naturalist compulsion.
[112:57.10]Oh yeah, you can move an enemy.
[113:00.00]I like that.
[113:01.50]I think that's very useful.
[113:03.90]Cool.
[113:04.46]Alright.
[113:04.80]So we quelled the invasion.
[113:08.54]Now we're just going to finish building the bridge.
[113:10.06]Let's finish building that bridge.
[113:17.11]Yep.
[113:18.39]I can't believe that's what we actually were doing.
[113:21.73]Building the bridge for the enemy.
[113:23.15]Yeah.
[113:29.66]Year five.
[113:32.25]Okay, so it's a strength four, or we can patrol and get it down.
[113:35.64]I feel like we could maybe handle a strength four, though.
[113:37.90]I think so.
[113:39.40]I think we're gods among men.
[113:41.22]We're in year five at this point, because Alongus took us on a two-year round trip.
[113:47.18]Sorry, we learned a lot.
[113:48.53]Yeah, we did.
[113:50.31]Got some stuff.
[113:51.07]Alright, you finally get to be in the game, so that's good.
[113:57.61]Yeah, look, I'm there.
[114:01.11]Uh, want me to keep going?
[114:06.09]A ridge of limestone wraps the edge of Ghost Ring.
[114:10.35]Find a way in from this direction, and you'd have the high ground.
[114:14.13]You'd have surprise.
[114:14.93]I don't know.
[114:18.89]Looks impossible.
[114:23.58]Possibly.
[114:25.18]But limestone is a rock full of surprises.
[114:31.60]after a few dead ends and false hopes I like that little snake finally a promising channel in the stone stretches out in the right direction probably carved by an ancient stream sea limestone is unnoteworthy that when repeatedly exposed to water what seems sturdy enough
[114:57.28]I think you just got trapped.
[114:58.40]You got lost in a thought there and we just kind of just didn't even think to interject.
[115:02.43]Yeah, his wolfy ramblings.
[115:05.31]You doing okay back there?
[115:06.29]It's kind of tight here, isn't it?
[115:14.07]Not all of us are made of wet noodles and silk.
[115:16.31]Some of us got warrior shoulders.
[115:21.49]Hey, perfect.
[115:26.21]Why are you so... You're so hard for you to maneuver.
[115:58.02]Should we pull him?
[116:00.24]Should we grab him and pull him through?
[116:02.94]You got this.
[116:03.88]You're a panther.
[116:05.49]You're... If anyone asks, tell them I went down honorably.
[116:13.03]You're not going to die here, are you?
[116:15.81]I have a 43% chance to push through, or I'm literally going to go around.
[116:22.23]We have to push through.
[116:23.07]I'm too stubborn.
[116:27.29]You sure there's nothing we can do?
[116:29.51]Stand it back might be best.
[116:34.63]And then twists and tightens in each turn.
[116:39.93]I hope you lose the other eye.
[116:47.91]That was damn right therapeutic.
[116:51.31]Alright, we did it.
[116:53.43]Kill them.
[116:54.70]Oh, our crit chance has doubled.
[116:56.95]Ooh.
[117:01.14]Alright.
[117:01.86]Also, yeah, something you guys might not be aware of is if you stand next to each other, you get a defensive bonus.
[117:07.98]You'll see a little shield appear.
[117:09.46]Oh, that's true.
[117:10.90]Cohesioncy?
[117:12.60]Cohesioncy?
[117:15.34]Yeah.
[117:19.44]And I started blasting.
[117:29.90]Oh, scalding rain.
[117:33.38]Oh, this is going to be insane.
[117:34.62]Alright.
[117:34.96]Who am I doing it to?
[117:36.97]You.
[117:41.15]That was a pretty cool move.
[117:41.79]It's because it's a well.
[117:44.41]Oh, you heat up with the fire stuff.
[117:46.61]That's great.
[117:54.58]Okay.
[117:54.82]Okay.
[117:59.90]Let's do it again.
[118:07.47]What does that do?
[118:10.47]It's like an RP thing.
[118:13.33]We get +2 movement, I think, when he howls.
[118:16.21]That's helpful.
[118:20.00]I'm going to do this.
[118:25.80]I'm going to fucking bite it.
[118:29.92]It was a pig, after all.
[118:34.08]Oh!
[118:34.68]Might as well just keep doing it.
[118:38.86]Aww.
[118:39.82]He blocked water.
[118:41.62]Bullshit.
[118:42.02]That was a lot.
[118:47.71]Nice.
[118:50.49]Alright.
[118:56.92]I wish my name was cool like dogwood.
[118:59.22]A snake stone sash.
[119:01.98]Dodge.
[119:02.58]Plus five dodge.
[119:07.12]There we go.
[119:07.98]My dodge is criminally low because I've got my big armor, so I think it's kind of pointless for me to have it if Thomas wants it.
[119:13.91]I'll take it.
[119:15.17]Yeah.
[119:20.33]Calamity.
[119:23.01]Alright.
[119:23.51]Now there's hordes of raccoons.
[119:27.68]Yeah, the Gorgons are absolutely stacked right now.
[119:32.16]Yeah, they are.
[119:33.38]Okay, do we want to secure Ghost Ring to find an item, or should we press on?
[119:38.10]Oh, look!
[119:39.19]All of the achievements have been done.
[119:41.19]We can now assault life from air.
[119:42.99]We can go all the way back.
[119:44.69]Should we go?
[119:45.13]I'd love a walk.
[119:47.29]I think... Yeah, let's go for it.
[119:50.77]Do we want to get some items before we go?
[119:52.65]By, like, securing.
[119:55.07]I mean, there's no harm in securing, right?
[119:58.08]Yeah, it's just a little bit more time passes.
[119:59.42]It's okay.
[120:00.54]I'm in the mood for some scouring and discovery.
[120:02.32]We can sit in this place right as we go, can't we?
[120:04.10]Alright, yeah.
[120:06.16]Let's find an item.
[120:07.46]Alright.
[120:11.88]Might as well.
[120:14.95]32 days.
[120:16.17]That's a long time.
[120:24.17]Keep your heroes busy.
[120:26.55]Oh, we're not... Okay, there we go.
[120:28.76]Oh, I see.
[120:29.12]Oh, God.
[120:34.88]Okay.
[120:35.56]A little scary, but that's okay.
[120:37.96]I think we can handle it.
[120:39.40]Yeah.
[120:43.19]Let them come.
[120:43.95]It's a new faction, that was.
[120:48.27]Happy birthday, everybody.
[120:49.83]Whose birthday?
[120:50.39]Is there somebody's birthday in chat?
[120:51.53]Happy birthday.
[120:52.17]Happy birthday.
[120:53.10]Happy birthday.
[120:56.27]It strikes me how much there is still to find to know I am inspired.

[121:32.27]I don't have dragonflight ah dudes I'm sorry I do but I'd rather play dogtide true none of us knew what had changed the beasts we could not change ourselves so we blamed the beasts guilty we knew something lived inside of them blue burning hate that frenzied them then left them still a stone sentence
[122:00.67]Worse and more deadly than any venom.
[122:05.07]Today we would finally find out where it came from and why it wouldn't stop.
[122:09.73]Hold on, go back for a sec.
[122:14.57]This is really framed.
[122:15.72]You get an alarm shot from you.
[122:18.60]Yeah.
[122:20.44]We hired a shit photographer for our adventure.
[122:26.48]Okay, yeah, we can go now.
[122:30.24]Well, Lithgrom air engine looks mostly intact.
[122:36.93]Maybe the rumors aren't true.
[122:42.17]Wouldn't make much sense, given what we've seen.
[122:49.08]Personally, I'm done expecting things to go smoothy.
[122:52.66]Taps eyepatch.
[122:53.76]Yeah, I'm with ya.
[122:58.63]Why is this town named Lithcrom Air Engine?
[123:03.85]What the fuck is an air engine?
[123:08.55]It's completely silent.
[123:11.65]Except for this.
[123:14.89]Oh no, we have to explore the town.
[123:16.38]That's literally our thing.
[123:17.40]Alright, I'll check this house.
[123:20.42]House looks good.
[123:21.04]What's going on here?
[123:26.86]I'll check the one on the right.
[123:32.66]Anything in there?
[123:36.56]Nothing?
[123:37.56]What's wrong?
[123:39.90]Oh.
[123:40.14]Petrified beyond our help now, yeah?
[123:41.84]Oh my goodness.
[124:02.39]As horrific as it is fascinating, what could have done this?
[124:05.81]Abdominal.
[124:06.78]And how many more are there?
[124:08.76]Abdominal.
[124:11.02]There's tracks.
[124:12.60]They go up to that barn door.
[124:15.20]Too many buildings around.
[124:15.98]No idea what could be waiting for us.
[124:17.12]And whatever did this could still be inside.
[124:21.72]Hey, they come.
[124:28.69]Here come our foes.
[124:34.01]Oh, I can't attack scenery of the people.
[124:38.99]Stop doing the protagonist voice.
[124:40.87]I'm sorry.
[124:43.95]I lit the fire.
[124:45.05]I'm staying.
[124:46.03]Thanks.
[124:46.25]I'm staying next to this fire.
[124:47.09]I'm going to be throwing it at people.
[124:48.45]I'm just going to wait here.
[124:49.85]I'm going to extinguish the fire.
[124:56.38]Don't do that.
[124:56.88]I need... Where are you going?
[125:02.14]What are you thinking?
[125:03.68]I'm chilling.
[125:07.18]Perfect.
[125:11.13]Who's priority?
[125:12.79]What's priority here?
[125:13.51]Probably the raccoons because they're ranged.
[125:26.46]They're out of range for me here.
[125:27.78]Wait, can I?
[125:29.26]Wait, what did I do?
[125:30.30]I'm going in.
[125:31.34]Yeah, they're too far.
[125:34.14]They're a little too far.
[125:35.01]They need to be a little bit closer for this, but I can do this.
[125:37.01]I think you could walk then throw.
[125:42.73]You're attached to the fire now.
[125:45.78]Oh, right.
[125:46.34]I'm attached.
[125:46.94]I forgot I could move.
[125:48.16]For some reason, I thought I'd be still next to it.
[125:50.28]Alright, here we go.
[125:52.14]I still can't.
[125:53.90]Oh, maybe it's the limit.
[125:56.46]The fire is the range.
[125:58.37]Oh, okay.
[125:58.87]Well, I'll just do this.
[126:07.36]Can you eat almonds on stream?
[126:09.10]Nah.
[126:09.26]We've got a bunch of movement, so I'm just going to run over here.
[126:12.59]Run interference.
[126:16.61]Okay.
[126:17.29]Oh.
[126:18.83]Everyone came to my rescue.
[126:20.03]I want them to shoot me.
[126:22.41]Oh, my God.
[126:23.06]That was one hit kill.
[126:25.72]It wasn't even your turn, right?
[126:26.58]You just did that because it shot you?
[126:28.20]Yeah, it was my first level up.
[126:29.54]I guess because it shot him and we're connected that I'm able to shoot back.
[126:35.00]I'm going to kill it.
[126:35.97]You're dead.
[126:37.26]I think I can hit this guy now.
[126:40.84]He's just out of range, really?
[126:48.67]Yeah, he's out of range still.
[127:01.04]Let's wait until he gets closer.
[127:02.02]They're coming out.
[127:11.78]Oh, good that you grabbed me.
[127:15.84]Alright, here we go.
[127:19.10]Oh, this is going to be big.
[127:22.40]How do you block fire?
[127:24.33]It's an element.
[127:25.77]I don't know, but I'm going to keep him here.
[127:32.07]That was good.
[127:33.81]Swap to the wand.
[127:35.11]I have it out already, don't I?
[127:36.86]Yeah, you have out.
[127:39.90]Propaganda.
[127:42.84]You've got that Rager coming in behind you as well, Alonus.
[127:48.33]I mean... Alonus, there's a cat behind you.
[127:50.71]I'm going sicko mode.
[127:57.63]Alright.
[128:03.98]Thorn Fang.
[128:08.26]I wonder if we save these people.
[128:15.68]Damn.
[128:18.12]Oh, yellow knife?
[128:23.78]Oh!
[128:25.96]Whoa.
[128:27.38]Alright, I'm going to move.
[128:30.52]I'm coming down here.
[128:37.74]Thank you.
[128:45.09]Why can't I use the fire?
[128:48.67]When you used it, you threw the fire itself.
[128:50.91]Oh, the fire itself was thrown.
[128:53.33]Alright, I'm going to move this one over here.
[128:58.38]What do I want to move you to?
[129:02.84]Never mind, they're dead.
[129:03.44]I feel like I can't really... I guess I could infuse with, like, this.
[129:13.00]I'm out of actions now.
[129:18.17]How do you move people, I wonder?
[129:19.43]Oh, big damage.
[129:32.34]Okay, where was the barn?
[129:38.02]All the way to the right.
[129:40.56]Okay, let's start heading there.
[129:42.52]I think that's where the beast will come from.
[129:54.98]I gotta defuse.
[129:58.60]There's tentacles coming out of this thing.
[130:00.00]There's probably going to be a boss in here.
[130:07.71]Yeah.
[130:10.61]I don't know if you guys want to get too close or if you want to set up over there.
[130:14.29]It's the co-mode.
[130:15.65]He's just going in.
[130:20.29]I'm just... I don't want to get hit by whatever opens this door.
[130:23.13]Okay, I think we... I'm just gonna wait a turn, and then we'll open next turn.
[130:29.57]The Gorgon.
[130:31.07]The silent slithering approach fascinates the mind and haunts the heart.
[130:37.01]Oh, shit.
[130:37.65]Okay.
[130:39.27]Anything in there?
[130:41.70]Let's find out.
[130:43.54]Can't see anything.
[130:44.40]12 health.
[130:52.83]Wait, I think I can illuminate something.
[130:56.82]I could try, or I could just... Oh, God.
[130:58.74]Oh, God.
[131:02.76]I'm surrounded.
[131:03.30]Okay, okay, okay.
[131:14.26]No!
[131:17.42]You fucked me.
[131:19.15]Well, I did it so that I'd have him... There you go.
[131:21.37]I guess that, yeah.
[131:23.05]No, I gain an action when I kill things, but that's probably better.
[131:32.81]I've got you, Thomas.
[131:36.05]Nice!
[131:36.37]Dammit.
[131:39.83]Remember when I was a guy?
[131:51.13]Come on, guys, finish him!
[131:55.48]I tried to move him.
[131:56.74]Wait, did you see that?
[131:58.98]You did a big amount of damage.
[132:01.30]No, because it attacked Thomas last turn, he got plus four damage for Lover's Vengeance.
[132:05.60]Yeah, I've been getting that.
[132:07.01]Really?
[132:08.03]Yeah.
[132:08.91]I fucking love you, dude.
[132:10.71]Let's give that to Thomas, because that will take his bonus damage up by one.
[132:14.15]Mario noise?
[132:14.95]Did I just do a Mario noise?
[132:17.89]Woohoo!
[132:19.23]I'm a blue horn warrior.
[132:21.65]Okay.
[132:24.66]I can force a foe to attack me.
[132:27.74]My melee attacks just deal one damage.
[132:30.12]That sounds pretty good.
[132:32.90]My melee attacks deal more based on the health I'm missing.
[132:41.18]These all sound kind of good.
[132:42.80]Yeah.
[132:43.08]I kind of like viciousness.
[132:44.04]Just one more damage.
[132:48.20]You never go wrong with extra damage.
[132:50.22]Sentinel looks like if I charge someone it steals their movement so they can't get to you guys.
[132:57.03]But if you just kill them... Yeah, you're right.
[132:59.43]That could have gone worse.
[133:04.93]Yes, bud.
[133:05.97]It's certainly not your standard plow mule.
[133:12.56]the hulking carcass steams from its many wounds hideous convulsions course along its appendages to the extremities of its body then why you no
[133:34.36]The thing's tremendous tail flicks across the barn.
[133:37.56]It plucks up Anon like he's a straw doll, his weapons falling uselessly from his hands as it pulls him in.
[133:46.39]Anon, don't panic.
[133:50.21]A voice leaks from Anon's mouth.
[133:52.87]It's a wrong voice, weird and discordant, like some fretting and plucking in a fiddle who's ever picked one up.
[134:00.46]I shoot him.
[134:02.06]Uh-oh.
[134:02.50]Ugh!
[134:24.81]You are not alike to us.
[134:28.53]Weak lungs, small minds, stacks of splintering bones, thin blood that will so readily betray you.
[134:41.64]Why flail for your lives?
[134:45.06]So noisy.
[134:47.18]Be wise now.
[134:52.76]Will you survive if you hurt him?
[134:56.48]You think I flail for life as you do?
[135:02.10]I am Gorgon.
[135:04.87]The master Ulstrix has promised us silence.
[135:12.47]The voice dissolves into a sound like rain or distant waves.
[135:16.57]Wriggling grips tighten.
[135:18.33]A tentacle invades Anahim's ear.
[135:23.23]Stop!
[135:25.37]I really gave that one my all.
[135:27.89]Thomas leaps forward in an instant.
[135:29.71]A rusty saw leaps off the iron hooks, metal ribboning and rippling loudly.
[135:35.59]Stop, I said.
[135:36.47]Are you using your magic power to throw a saw?
[135:46.30]Sound effect.
[135:52.08]The saw slices into the neck of the great beast.
[135:56.87]Ah!
[136:01.35]As the longest rushes over to make certain of the Gorgon's... Wait, go back a scene.
[136:05.93]Look what happened to my face.
[136:07.47]Look at the blue on my face.
[136:09.86]Yes, you're going to be the next Marvel hero.
[136:12.68]Oh, man.
[136:13.58]Is this my origin story?
[136:15.58]Your eye's going to grow back.
[136:17.48]As the longest rushes over to make certain of the Gorgon's demise, Thomas supports Anon, helping him to stand.
[136:25.01]Somebody said, you're only useful in cutscenes.
[136:28.34]I'm doing okay, alright?
[136:30.48]You're okay.
[136:33.02]A strange stony affliction spreads from Inan's ear.
[136:37.21]Inan?
[136:43.31]This isn't over.
[136:46.89]I saw its mind.
[136:48.78]This stone was an extra heart.
[136:52.25]Anon takes the stone from Melongus' palm, turning it in front of his eyes, catching the slender sunbeams that slice the barn wall.
[136:58.11]The strange, polyhedral stone is slick with the Gorgon's blood.
[137:02.17]Epichrist.
[137:07.25]Each face is graven with an intricate image.
[137:11.22]The word in the Gorgon's head was Epichrist.
[137:17.40]This town.
[137:18.68]Livergrim Air Engine.
[137:20.71]These petrified people, even this monster.
[137:23.67]They're insignificant in the coming epoch.
[137:28.35]The Epicurus glistens sticky and blue.
[137:31.66]The Gorgons have a master.
[137:33.80]Ulstrix, it's called.
[137:35.50]It's looking for something.
[137:36.56]Some myth or secret.
[137:38.90]I think the riddle is in the stone.
[137:42.48]I think we have to find out what he wants and make sure he doesn't get it I think we should we all I think said that collectively yeah so I lost a bunch of charisma because I got a up face and became a giga loner and Thomas gained 10 years on his career that works for me one one of us came off better
[138:07.15]okay so that is chapter one done so now it kind of tells us a little resources and it says 10 years of peace followed 10 years of peace yeah we we did that so we lose some cards they lose some cards because uh 10 years of peace during the years of peace what happened
[138:27.50]the Gorgon's mark grew and crusted over to cover one side of Inan's face.
[138:31.59]It would be a grim reminder of the encounter that day in the Lithgram Air Engine Barn.
[138:35.21]Good job I'm blind on that side.
[138:36.77]Yeah, that's true.
[138:39.95]On his more civilized days, a Longus would drop into town for gossip and tool repairs, but on the whole, he felt clear-headed among his wilder kin.
[138:50.18]Now that the job wasn't quite as dangerous, a Longus became a guide to travelers crossing the more treacherous stretches of the swamp and the mountain.
[138:58.48]Thomas and Alongus were married, and one winter night they held an ancient and evocative ceremony that Alongus had read of.
[139:05.26]A feast followed.
[139:06.84]The people of Sleeping Top were startled but pleased at the generosity Thomas displayed that night.
[139:12.47]Alongus would always remember the moment like a scene brought to life from history, from legend, and he and Thomas indelibly written into the world's pages.
[139:23.82]Transformations.
[139:24.98]You have a choice to advance along this transformation and get a wolf arm.
[139:29.29]You'll be able to get a wolf claw for five to eight damage.
[139:32.38]Yeah.
[139:34.25]Okay.
[139:35.91]Now we move to gear upgrades.
[139:37.95]Yeah, so basically you can see our current resources in the top left and then we can click whichever player we want and we can kind of kit them out with new upgrades.
[139:46.42]So if we wanted to make you like a tier two bow, it would use up four hot woods, an ingot, a hide, a fabric.
[139:52.36]We could craft it and then give it to you.
[139:54.40]So it's kind of like, what are we missing?
[139:56.78]What do we need?
[139:57.34]That kind of thing.
[140:00.05]I would say looking at our stuff, Thomas is the only one that doesn't have any armor.
[140:05.19]So maybe we... I don't, yeah.
[140:07.41]Maybe we click this.
[140:10.07]And maybe we want to craft Thomas like a dusty drab or an ember gown.
[140:15.69]Which one of these do you like the look of?
[140:19.09]Let's see.
[140:19.49]Ooh.
[140:22.30]Ooh.
[140:24.92]And so for every piece of, like, resource we're missing, we can spend an LP.
[140:29.54]So we only have one fabric, but we can use an LP to make an extra fabric.
[140:33.37]So these two-star ones are expensive.
[140:36.39]Yeah, we can click it and look.
[140:39.27]So that would be, it would cost us three LP, but I think that's fine if you wanted to go for that.
[140:44.04]I mean, this drab, this two-star drab seems like it's pretty good.
[140:46.84]Three armor, two warning, one spell damage.
[140:48.34]Alright, yeah.
[140:49.18]So just click craft.
[140:52.32]Oh, yeah.
[140:55.83]let's go there you go so now you're cared out sweet um so we've got a bunch of stuff left um let's have a look what we could do would you rather have like a bow over a like armor I want I want a dueling sword so I can be a rapier wielding wolf it just makes sense okay
[141:22.36]Well, as a ranger, you can use a dueling sword up here.
[141:25.56]So we can make the giant scratch.
[141:28.18]Yeah.
[141:29.42]Ooh.
[141:32.72]Or we can make the dueling sword.
[141:34.98]It's only one damage difference, and this one costs nothing.
[141:36.87]Oh, I get to name it.
[141:38.35]I'm making it.
[141:39.97]Okay, are you making the tier two or the tier one?
[141:42.01]Tier two.
[141:43.77]You have such a cool character.
[141:46.67]Okay.
[141:48.03]Anon, go first.
[141:51.12]Uh, I think Anna needs just a big weapon.
[141:54.50]I think I need a better than this spear.
[141:58.14]What we got?
[141:59.02]I'm thinking like a gray axe or something.
[142:01.64]Ooh.
[142:07.16]Um.
[142:07.84]Like a mace, maybe?
[142:08.66]Two-handed hammer?
[142:11.38]Yeah, gray axe or a great sword.
[142:13.04]You think I'm more of a hammer guy, or do you think I'm like a
[142:22.31]um I don't know I I um I feel like this is a hammer you're gonna turn into a golem golems are required by law to use hammers and maces it's just how it goes golem with an axe you're gonna get laughed at wow okay
[142:47.01]um although great axe works too if we craft this we can only make the tier one rapier though we can't have that Ster has to have the best weapon uh no that's fine okay uh the mountain break that's what it's named I'm gonna re-roll it tower sludger yes ooh okay and then we've got this boy we can actually so you want a dueling sword
[143:17.74]We can make you a dueling sword, and we can also make you a tier 2 crossbow.
[143:22.65]Um... Oh.

[143:32.25]We're out of money.
[143:34.13]Why did I get disconnected?
[143:36.21]We can use LP, though.
[143:37.15]I don't know.
[143:37.54]Why are you running?
[143:39.64]We can save and remake.
[143:40.48]I think you can just rejoin, actually.
[143:42.50]Can I just rejoin?
[143:44.16]I think so.
[143:44.54]Let me try and rejoin.
[143:48.26]uh okay disconnect boom it's thinking I think it might be crashing okay should I just do play or my legacy um is this play and there's also my legacy do I have to like select that character maybe
[144:13.61]Um, I'm not sure.
[144:14.93]I think we can like remake the lobby.
[144:16.43]I can just like save and we can remake it.
[144:20.58]Uh, okay.
[144:23.10]Let's let our boy build what he needs though.

[144:26.64]I clicked next.
[144:27.82]Okay.
[144:28.08]Let's do.
[144:29.00]Okay.
[144:30.08]Last save was three seconds ago.
[144:31.76]Steam maintenance Tuesday.
[144:34.71]Oh, that's what it is.
[144:35.83]Is that what it actually is?
[144:37.41]It's going to get all of us.
[144:38.23]Yeah.
[144:38.73]Oh no.
[144:39.15]Oh, it takes like five minutes or so.
[144:42.07]Yeah.
[144:47.51]um so five minute break I don't know if you guys can even see this or if I can save I don't wait no stripping was the uh the leader I think so do you even quit is currently grayed out uh by saved 30 seconds ago so so are all are all of our characters on your kind of client side or do we have those here on ours I wonder I believe it's just on mine because I'm hosting yeah so we can just remake it but okay
[145:13.72]Yeah, we can just wait for Steam maintenance, I guess.
[145:16.76]Is that actually what happened?
[145:17.82]Or can people confirm that?
[145:19.10]Or are people just being goofy?
[145:21.68]I'm online.
[145:22.24]I don't know if you're offline on Steam or if you look fine.
[145:27.87]Let's find out.
[145:30.35]Somebody said, I got it too.
[145:31.27]It's real.
[145:31.61]I got it.
[145:31.91]I got it.
[145:32.19]Okay.
[145:33.27]Okay.

[145:38.58]Let me try to get back in.
[145:40.48]I'm going to add you to friends anyway.
[145:47.65]Steam.
[145:49.19]Oh, okay.
[145:50.25]I can't even add you as a friend.
[145:54.58]Good old Steam Maintenance Tuesday.
[145:57.17]Oh, yeah.
[145:59.09]The thing is, like, this has been happening consistently on a Tuesday for, like, 10 years, and every week I forget it exists until it happens.
[146:04.71]Seriously, same thing.
[146:06.63]I think I actually had a meltdown on stream one time where I said I would never be live ever again between, like, 12 and 5 p.m.
[146:14.28]on Tuesday ever again.
[146:15.98]I think I say that every single Tuesday this happens.
[146:21.02]This is what I'm saying.
[146:21.98]Like, it's time to go.
[146:23.74]Let's all go to the Epic Games Store.
[146:27.34]Gamers, rise up.
[146:30.88]I'm gonna I'll go I'm gonna go pee.
[146:32.36]I'll be back.
[146:32.96]Okay.
[146:33.76]Hopefully it comes right back and doesn't because sometimes it takes like 30 plus minutes.
[146:38.52]Wait, really?
[146:39.38]This happened before?
[146:40.06]Yeah.
[146:41.34]We'll find out.

[153:10.42]It's hanging out down.
[153:11.04]Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[153:16.12]Okay, and then invite to lobby.

[153:23.01]What if that invite works?
[153:25.25]Show Otto.
[153:26.65]No, I don't want to go get Otto.
[153:29.07]He's probably comfortable.

[153:34.99]Yeah.
[153:36.83]I'm in there.
[153:37.39]I don't see an invite.

[154:15.22]Um...
[154:17.47]I'm just going to restart the game.
[154:21.57]I think that maybe when it was the Steam maintenance happened, it maybe has to be rebooted or something.
[154:27.93]Thank you, Gaben.
[154:30.82]You know what?
[154:33.40]It's what?
[154:34.32]Three o'clock in the afternoon Pacific?
[154:37.22]Yeah.
[154:41.06]Like right in the middle of the day.
[154:42.18]It's an inconsiderate time.
[154:44.38]That's what it is.
[154:45.22]How dare they?
[154:45.79]I'm just kidding.
[154:48.70]Alright.
[154:49.44]I'm back in.
[154:50.26]Let's see if I can join you.
[154:51.92]Okay.
[154:52.76]I'm actually going to... Alright.
[154:58.00]I'm trying to join you right now.
[155:00.27]I'm remaking the game.
[155:07.87]Otto's comfy gaming in his gaming room.
[155:10.73]Okay.
[155:10.97]You guys should be able to join me.
[155:12.45]I made a friend's lobby.
[155:14.45]And then I'll load the... Hey, I can see it.
[155:16.01]Yep.
[155:16.90]There it is.
[155:19.88]Alright, crisis averted.
[155:22.74]Hey, there we go.
[155:23.10]I'm in.
[155:24.14]Yeah, you're in.
[155:28.55]I'm in.
[155:30.35]I'm in.
[155:31.01]I can't see the current panel, though.
[155:32.87]It's like blank.
[155:34.07]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[155:35.31]We made the lobby.
[155:36.99]Oh, what the hell am I in?
[155:40.05]I don't know.
[155:41.34]You know, I don't want to know.
[155:45.56]Yeah, sir, I had to restart my whole game for it to show up.
[155:48.76]If you didn't do that yet.
[155:52.02]Uh, can you, like, settle down?
[155:59.02]Yeah.
[156:00.62]Yep.
[156:02.52]I'm good.
[156:03.18]Hold on, I'm gonna restart my game.
[156:05.92]You might be onto something.
[156:07.46]Wait, are you restarting or are you good?
[156:09.36]I'm restarting.
[156:19.53]Mmm...
[156:25.07]man that's as beautiful as the song we sung together I wonder how that actually turned out alright I wonder were we even matching the same tempo I who could who could know alright let's uh get back in here can you see it I hope so
[156:52.29]I see like a blue screen with leaves.
[156:54.55]Mine's blue.
[156:55.83]Hooray.
[156:57.45]Alright.
[156:58.77]New threats.
[157:04.86]Alright.
[157:05.56]Oh, yeah, we missed the whole thing then because the last one was talking about like trying to figure out what the crystal meant.
[157:12.35]I feel like that might be a way to go back and watch it.
[157:16.04]It's possible it just got kind of sniped from the Steam going down.
[157:21.28]It's alright, though.
[157:21.84]We can just fill in the blanks.
[157:24.18]Wow, what does this thing do?
[157:25.96]Well, we know you guys got married.
[157:28.52]We know that I was just a loner for a long time.
[157:35.41]So look at that.
[157:36.85]We have to go investigate Lambstream Altar.
[157:40.92]Yes.
[157:41.76]How do we reliably get there?
[157:43.72]We're down from sleeping top?
[157:47.80]Yeah, we're back in Thunder Roast now.
[157:51.66]This seems treacherous.
[157:52.60]I feel like this is a treacherous way to go.
[157:54.94]Yeah, I think we go into the Dacia Forest, right?
[157:58.53]That's our next play.
[157:59.93]I think that's the play.
[158:01.73]Okay, we all aged 10 years.
[158:04.09]So now I'm 39.
[158:05.69]I've got gray in my hair.
[158:08.27]What does it show, your age? 30.
[158:10.58]no no but yeah if you hover over yourself it'll tell your age it's weird if you look at my look at my portrait I've got like gray in my hair hang on I've got oh hang on I've got side quests I'm the youngest not one for festivals what's the point no one's having conversations just songs and I don't like songs now yeah I thought you loved songs
[158:37.57]I am over songs.
[158:39.17]Once I went on a two-year trip to sing one.
[158:43.21]Yeah, I actually feel the same.
[158:44.61]I love how the panel just completed your other arm.
[158:48.38]Still trying to do my part.
[158:53.84]Community spirit.
[158:55.62]Right, yeah.
[158:58.04]I've gained my chance then.
[158:59.48]Might be stimulating.
[159:03.32]Later, wolf claw.
[159:07.22]That was damn right uncanny.
[159:10.18]It was lucky.
[159:14.01]Honestly though, do you have a secret?
[159:17.67]I've never seen someone rule that well.
[159:21.57]No secret.
[159:22.53]I get on these streets sometimes, cars, dice, coins.
[159:25.72]But now that you mention it, I've always wondered what would happen if we were just to pick a direction.
[159:32.70]A direction?
[159:35.36]Just pick a direction and go.
[159:36.98]If I'm really on a hot streak, well, I bet we'll find a magic item.
[159:40.94]Magic item?
[159:42.34]Seriously?
[159:43.26]You really are Scooby-Doo.
[159:46.92]Scooby-Snow.
[159:47.82]There we go.
[159:51.34]Write him.
[159:52.28]I want, I want, write him.
[159:54.06]Okay.
[159:54.88]We're all going.
[159:57.06]We're all going.
[159:58.18]Let's go.
[159:58.70]We're just going to pick a direction.
[160:00.86]Apparently.
[160:04.41]My trip took us like three days.
[160:07.21]I see the edge of the forest.
[160:10.88]Oh, so this forest has an edge.
[160:14.36]That's nice.
[160:18.02]What the hell was that?
[160:19.52]Everything has an edge.
[160:21.94]Including my patience.
[160:23.23]It's like Yoda too.
[160:26.67]Look.
[160:28.27]It was a joke in the first place, wasn't it?
[160:30.99]Keep walking until we find a what?
[160:33.05]Why would someone do that?
[160:35.17]Just walk around and wander for no reason.
[160:39.24]Nice to take a little trip.
[160:41.54]But the trips... Hang on a minute.
[160:44.62]I walked for two years for you.
[160:46.54]You have no leg to stand on here.
[160:50.62]I don't understand.
[160:51.60]At least check out that castle first.
[160:56.33]That's so funny.
[160:57.78]Why are you huge?
[160:59.06]You look pissed.
[161:00.48]You do not want to be here right now.
[161:04.81]Make a Lungus climb.
[161:08.65]I think that's funnier.
[161:09.67]Okay.
[161:26.79]they climb through a crumbling window you certainly like to make things hard oh you're behind my arm I'm thorough always start at the top of a problem and work your way down goes for castles too well fine that makes some sense I guess
[161:56.50]Well, to tell the age, these double beams are a hallmark of even way to build her.
[162:00.81]She's 200 years dead.
[162:02.83]Your neck seems a little stiff.
[162:05.55]The other side is yours.
[162:07.13]There's a pretty big gap.
[162:10.53]You can see to the lower level.
[162:12.93]Well, this stuff's more recent.
[162:16.79]What stuff?
[162:19.64]Stop.
[162:20.16]Stop that.
[162:21.68]Little trove collected from who knows where.
[162:25.71]Does it look magical?
[162:28.70]Not even a tiny bit.
[162:32.06]That's the first time I've been happy.
[162:34.46]You probably found a bone.
[162:36.04]Tell you what, though.
[162:39.84]It does look guarded.
[162:42.19]Took you that long to see that thing in the room with you guys?
[162:44.71]Yeah, I was there the whole time.
[162:46.05]I was there the entire time.
[162:48.05]The butler.
[162:48.71]Look at this thing.
[162:49.29]Oh, my God.
[162:52.59]Alright.
[162:56.22]What do we got?
[162:56.68]Oh, my God.
[162:57.34]Look at Thomas, how much magic armor he has.
[162:59.52]I know, I am unstoppable.
[163:01.20]Actually, I'm going to move again.
[163:03.94]I want to get closer.
[163:04.82]This thing's got a lot of health, by the way.
[163:10.07]And I pop him.
[163:20.23]Nice.
[163:22.52]Thomas, if you take damage, I'll... I'll get upset.
[163:26.45]Alright, well, that was... Oh, okay.
[163:29.41]Eleven damage.
[163:30.15]Holy shit.
[163:35.17]Never mind.
[163:38.18]The fuck?
[163:39.52]It's remarkable to find one alone like this.
[163:42.94]Up here would be curious what directed its decision.
[163:46.90]If decision is even the right word.
[163:48.95]Well, let's not razz more of them, eh?
[163:54.96]We can grab some of these materials.
[163:57.57]Right, that's what I mean.
[163:59.71]And then, back where we came.
[164:04.09]A short while later.
[164:07.89]So, looks like I won the bet.
[164:11.73]Seems you did.
[164:12.43]You guys were betting?
[164:15.40]What do I owe you now?
[164:16.44]Socks?
[164:17.76]No socks.
[164:21.98]What you failed to mention is a size.
[164:29.59]My neck!
[164:30.73]My neck!
[164:34.25]On the journey back, my neck breaks.
[164:37.59]There's a tea house not far.
[164:42.59]Hold on, but socks?
[164:44.89]There are different socks sizes?
[164:47.07]I thought it was just like a pair of socks.
[164:48.49]It's like universal, isn't it?
[164:49.65]Like size like 5 through like 14 or something?
[164:52.61]How would a size 14 foot fit in a size 5 sock?
[164:57.67]I don't know.
[164:58.35]Aren't socks, like, just one size?
[164:59.75]Really?
[165:00.65]Is that why sometimes I get fucking fucked up socks that just don't fit?
[165:04.79]I thought it was just, like, medium.
[165:06.71]Like, medium or big.
[165:07.43]I didn't know they had, like, whatever.
[165:21.20]I'm not kidding, I swear to God, this makes perfect sense.
[165:23.80]I share socks with my four-year-old daughter, yeah.
[165:26.14]No, I just... My size is 13 feet.
[165:30.21]Dude, I have socks, and I was trying to figure out why the fuck this happened.
[165:33.75]I'm not kidding, this is a real story.
[165:35.43]Every single pair of socks that I own has a huge hole in both feet at the bottom.
[165:41.50]And it's in the same exact spot, and it's definitely because I bought socks that were way too small.
[165:46.62]That's ridiculous.
[165:47.34]I can't believe it.
[165:48.20]Yeah, you might have to buy new socks, but you didn't win the bet, so.
[165:53.40]I thought... Man, and you missed Black Friday.
[165:57.97]You're going to have to wait another year.
[165:59.91]They don't make it in time.
[166:00.99]It are soaked in the storm.
[166:02.99]But the tea house is dry.
[166:04.99]The fragrant teas and later the mugs of mulled whiskey are hot.
[166:11.70]Hot whiskey is a thing.
[166:13.26]Yeah.
[166:13.46]Yeah.
[166:13.72]Hot whiskey is amazing.
[166:14.62]You ever had it?
[166:15.90]You ever had hot whiskey?
[166:16.87]Had some honey.
[166:18.99]Do you actually, have you had it a lot before?
[166:20.79]I haven't had it before.
[166:21.49]No.
[166:23.17]I'm not speaking to you.
[166:24.61]No.
[166:25.29]There's one more round for you.
[166:28.97]It's something I have whenever I'm like, I catch a cold or something.
[166:31.92]It's called a... I mean, America has hot toddies, but I think they're a bit different in America.
[166:36.40]But hot toddies and... I don't think in America when we get sick, I don't think we drink alcohol.
[166:41.56]Hot toddies in England and Ireland is like whiskey with honey.
[166:46.13]And that's like it.
[166:46.87]And some lemon juice.
[166:47.55]Really?
[166:48.45]Yeah.
[166:48.87]And it's really good.
[166:50.11]That sounds pretty good.
[166:53.15]Hot whiskey.
[166:54.79]Yeah, I've never had it.
[166:55.48]I'm just curious if you had it.
[166:56.98]That's cool.
[167:00.20]Thinking about something.
[167:03.20]Just rain.
[167:07.96]Rain and all these nine mystical phenomena that paint our lives.
[167:11.72]That we try to explain into mundanity so we can take them for granted.
[167:15.74]You don't know what rain is.
[167:17.18]What's rain?
[167:22.02]I mean, but also all this stuff.
[167:27.76]I don't know.
[167:28.48]Think back to our journey's beginning.
[167:30.28]Fortune is the spur of the moment that strikes restless hearts and Sparks an adventure.
[167:35.47]Luck is the people you share it with.
[167:40.11]Guess I need another cup.
[167:42.95]I'm not as drunk as you yet.
[167:47.33]Just one more.
[167:51.01]Alright.
[167:51.79]I thought that was a sandwich.
[167:55.84]You feel like you're getting hungry?
[167:57.54]Oh, you leveled up.
[167:58.68]Nice.
[167:59.44]Plus 10 retirement age.
[168:00.54]Okay.
[168:01.78]Inan gets two extra armor.
[168:07.69]I might just take two extra armor.
[168:10.01]Every other turn as a swift action, Inan sheds two of a foe's armor.
[168:12.97]Now, let's do it.
[168:13.73]I want to be tankier.
[168:14.65]Let's do that.
[168:19.90]Okay, they're shifting over to the... Mortha... Mortha... How is it?
[168:23.84]Morthagi?
[168:25.14]Morthagai?
[168:27.20]What's going on, man?
[168:29.31]I'm trying to... Is he having a seizure?
[168:31.45]No!
[168:32.31]The name of the groups, like the Gorgons.
[168:36.13]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[168:36.77]I see what you're saying.
[168:37.53]Alright.
[168:37.79]So you can see in Brandland as a recruit opportunity.
[168:41.81]So if we had someone die or your character like had lost both his arms, we could replace someone in our party and like recruit someone new.
[168:50.23]If we recruit someone new, we would actually be the fabulous four.
[168:53.71]We would.
[168:54.12]But then it wouldn't be funny anymore.
[168:55.98]I don't like that.
[168:57.32]Yeah.
[168:57.66]I think we should just like go past it and scout.
[169:00.56]We're going to Dacia Forest.
[169:04.14]Sounds good.
[169:08.38]Alright, dismiss.
[169:09.40]300 days remaining.
[169:12.75]Oh, till the end.
[169:14.03]Oh, no.
[169:14.59]Great.
[169:15.57]Okay.
[169:17.19]Let's go.
[169:20.77]What if we just wandered around for a bit?
[169:23.95]Oh, event.
[169:25.21]Ooh.
[169:28.05]I have lost eyes, throwing them, irretrievable, upon the sea.
[169:32.44]I have drowned my voice in those wailing waters.
[169:36.28]Hmm.
[170:04.69]That's a tantalizing crumb.
[170:06.41]I don't want to do every single thing.
[170:11.34]I was waiting.
[170:12.32]I was hoping you were just going to do all of them.
[170:17.48]To someone who little knows the weight of knowledge, I am sure it appeals.
[170:23.96]You must realize the only story that is my interest in.
[170:29.01]What has a star ever told me that made me want less to know it?
[170:33.18]Rain chatters on the thatch.
[170:37.24]I see things written in the turning of storms, in silver-wet letters and shaking pages of rain.
[170:41.91]I read of dreams left behind this yondering.
[170:45.35]I read of dooms the years intend.
[170:47.69]I read until my eyes shine and my stomach roars.
[170:54.24]I have read of you.
[170:55.80]I know what you are meant to be.
[170:56.84]A dog.
[170:58.78]A dog.
[170:59.44]You're meant to be just a full dog.
[171:07.70]No one demands you believe.
[171:09.28]You only must endure what happens.
[171:14.94]The old storage building smells like ancient hay, moist rock, and the burning pine pitch of their torch.
[171:24.67]The woman's robe moves like it's part of her.
[171:27.25]She shrugs.
[171:30.89]gonna be really hard for me to continue because I just looked over at my chat and I just see stewie being spammed and it's like ruining everything with the fingers together right now fortunes I think you're doing a really good voice fortunes were given to crows to tell and crows were kind enough to share their gift with witches a witch well paid shares fortunes with the way blind Brian
[172:02.62]I'll give you my blood.
[172:04.52]Wait, another transformation?
[172:06.84]Another transformation.
[172:08.04]For you?
[172:09.32]Yeah, do it, man.
[172:10.25]What are you going to turn into?
[172:14.87]Then you have already glimpsed the form your roving spirit must take.
[172:18.87]You have seen it in your sleep, and it will not shatter you.
[172:22.98]I dream that I don't see it.
[172:24.86]I sort of insist on a different answer.
[172:29.01]You go winged, but never flying.
[172:30.81]Fast, but rarely fleeing.
[172:32.67]Your wander leads you to things you never thought you chased.
[172:40.67]Along it.
[172:41.59]Thought we agreed I would be the one who you confided in.
[172:44.81]The rain will pause.
[172:50.64]Huh?
[172:51.76]I just ignore Thomas.
[172:53.20]I don't even look at you.
[172:56.96]The rain will pause in the morning.
[172:58.99]Do not worry much, for you will love yourself, lonelier though it may make you.
[173:05.09]There was, by the way, a queen in my dream last night.
[173:10.18]In case that's important.
[173:13.30]She halts momentarily, the stillness of a startled bird.
[173:19.80]Some dreams are only flights of fancy.
[173:22.79]No, but like there was also a king and a castle and there was these giant motorized vehicles with tires and... The night elapses.
[173:32.67]The rain sounds like a river of dragonflies flowing by.
[173:36.96]Snoring thunder is occasional and soft, growing ever more distant.
[173:41.46]Alongus and Thomas sleep at some point, taking turns.
[173:45.86]Am I just stuck out in the rain?
[173:47.30]Yeah.
[173:49.29]I think you're in the rain.
[173:49.99]This is my life.
[173:50.39]I'm such a disgusting loner.
[173:53.17]the woman walks out into the pale pre-dawn without a sound or a pain or any observed moment of metamorphosis a longus wakes up bwing you have crow wings on your back what's happening to you they'll continue on to word hero index
[174:16.08]is that the name of a town it's a random town yeah they just randomly name them word hero index hey Thomas there you are along us with you couldn't find you in the rain that's a camp what the is out your back I'm a bird dog fight
[174:33.78]time to dry out these wings so now you have wings your character is so much cooler than all everything Thomas is just normal guy in a robe yeah I'm like I've got like a stone face and along this is like a winged wolf can I get like laser eyes or something eventually here I don't think it does anything alright so maybe maybe increases your movement or something I don't know
[174:58.97]what are we we've been uh attacked or something I kicked the door open oh god I just walked back and forth like an idiot um does your sentinel trigger if they walk up to you or they have to walk by uh if they move within two spaces I'll run so if they move I'll run into the building so if you want like a defense bonus be next to Thomas
[175:28.83]Hold that.
[175:34.18]Dog.
[175:36.84]Alarm.
[175:40.10]Damn, you guys really just do... You guys just crush.
[175:46.27]Stormthroat bird?
[175:47.79]What the fuck did you do to me?
[175:53.69]One shred damage at the start of every turn.
[175:58.67]Oh, wait, I can shoo the bird away.
[176:00.85]My turn.
[176:01.43]There we go.
[176:03.32]I just smashed that.
[176:05.22]There could have been a device in there.
[176:06.48]There could have been like a weapon.
[176:07.30]Smash that bird button.
[176:08.90]Smash that button.
[176:13.54]I mean, I can't really get in there.
[176:16.08]I can move.
[176:18.95]Let's go up here.
[176:20.73]Well, I think I need, I guess I could take the axe out.
[176:28.27]They're leaving you in the dark.
[176:29.09]They sounded an alarm, so I think something's gonna come for us.
[176:31.69]They're not leaving... Guys, I am like the caster's support.
[176:34.60]I am not supposed to be up there fighting.
[176:36.38]I'm supposed to be back throwing fireballs at walls and... and collecting stones and stuff.
[176:45.35]Oh shit.
[176:49.03]Um... I will block his route to you.
[176:51.39]Like this.
[176:56.94]Oh, that's so you don't want to be next to the bench.
[177:01.98]You fool.
[177:02.96]You, what have you done?
[177:04.24]Uh, actually.
[177:10.05]Um, I'm going in.
[177:16.71]Oh my god, there's more than one.
[177:18.09]Alright, I have to get in here because I can't target anything.
[177:23.68]there's nothing in this room guys you're just alone in there plus 35 to loner I remember oh you guys got you guys got that easy oh my goodness you talk about how much damage we do and then you just do the same damage yeah but I need a network to attack people yeah that's true you got like a big spider web going
[177:47.66]Yeah, well, my character is actually bottom tier.
[177:49.94]The Ushaker of Draxion.
[177:51.50]It's a new wand that also contains a melee strike if they get too close.
[177:57.41]You can probably replace the axe with a melee wand.
[178:01.65]Yeah.
[178:02.67]I wonder because that's just spell.
[178:04.81]Is it more spell damage than the wand?
[178:06.31]Yeah, it gives you +2 spell.
[178:08.65]I wonder if the spell damage, like, applies even if you're not using it.
[178:11.43]I wonder.
[178:12.43]We'll find out.
[178:13.67]Yeah, I don't know.
[178:18.29]What's that over there?
[178:19.21]Please help me.

[180:09.95]No one wants to hang out with you anymore.
[180:11.55]You're a crow wolf.
[180:14.15]Everyone's afraid of you.
[180:16.87]Okay.
[180:17.95]I've got one.
[180:20.10]What's your favorite fruit?
[180:24.40]Ever have a cliff cherry?
[180:26.34]They're rare, but worth splurging on at least once in your life.
[180:30.28]What's happening to Thomas' voice?
[180:31.52]Didn't I age like 20 years or something?
[180:35.01]Oh, you did age 10 years.
[180:35.91]Yeah.
[180:36.69]I mean, you got a little bit of gray in your hair.
[180:38.75]It's a little older.
[180:39.51]Yeah.
[180:39.91]Alright.
[180:40.13]Hold on.
[180:41.11]I'll fix it.
[180:43.49]Careful there.
[180:44.81]Your fancy taste is showing.
[180:48.45]Next up, a difficult one.
[180:52.01]Favorite thing to fight.
[180:56.16]What?
[180:57.02]That's like asking my favorite rash.
[181:03.00]Least favorite then.
[181:06.53]Might have to go Gorgon.
[181:09.91]Is that because they're over the next hill?
[181:12.07]It's the ick factor, and even worse than Thrixle.
[181:18.75]They don't just move, they spread, and they're like walking diseases.
[181:25.54]And here I am, making a career.
[181:29.28]I feel like you should start adding some chroisms to yours.
[181:33.24]You are really trying to get this callback for this role, by the way.
[181:36.89]Yeah.
[181:38.69]I wonder if the casting director is going to call you back.
[181:45.71]This guy wants to be a dog so bad.
[181:51.55]Why are we talking about our favorite foods?
[181:53.53]Well, we appreciate that.
[182:04.43]I turned what's your favorite food into, like, my life doesn't mean anything anymore.
[182:10.39]Maybe I can start over.
[182:11.41]Maybe it's not too late.
[182:13.69]Oh, cliff berries.
[182:14.51]All my choices were wrong.
[182:15.71]I'm half wolf, quarter bird.
[182:17.81]Well, what about you?
[182:19.09]What keeps you on this mortal plane?
[182:21.77]I can't last another day.
[182:25.25]The opportunity to make history.
[182:26.71]Honestly, the gear.
[182:28.38]You mean other than you?
[182:29.52]Ooh.
[182:35.48]The face is too good on screen.
[182:36.84]The face is too good.
[182:37.48]I feel like I'm rejecting you.
[182:39.57]We're married and... You're cringing.
[182:41.17]You're visibly cringing.
[182:42.19]Why are you cringing?
[182:44.25]Yeah, he's doing like a wolf cringe.
[182:46.49]You should not be cringing to this.
[182:50.23]So many things, really.
[182:52.03]That laughy form.
[182:54.09]That dazzling smile.
[182:55.45]The way you whisper my name before a fight.
[182:59.09]Okay, I gotta do that from now on.
[183:01.75]That's not an answer.
[183:03.31]That's random flattery.
[183:06.24]He's just powergamed you into whispering his name before a fight.
[183:09.30]Plus, what kind of man would I be if I left you to get picked up by some beefy Gorgon?
[183:15.56]You don't fuck.
[183:16.60]I just said Gorgons are my least favorite enemy.
[183:20.74]That's true.
[183:21.60]Come hither, away from those tentacles.
[183:24.62]And I'm toast.
[183:26.08]Oh, wait, you're a hentai guy?
[183:27.68]Thomas and Alongus gain temporary damage and potency.
[183:33.43]Dude, I'm gonna be so totally denied.
[183:37.70]Where's the squirrel?
[183:46.81]Where did he go?
[183:47.81]I need to... Do you want a water crossbow or a water dueling sword?
[184:05.56]Can we give you, like, water legs or something?
[184:07.90]Can you transform again?
[184:08.80]Water legs.
[184:13.88]Um... I feel like Thomas' side quest is, like, going to be so mundane.
[184:20.29]He's going to be like, hey, do you guys want to play Uno?
[184:22.65]And then we just play Uno.
[184:23.97]Well, yeah, wasn't your original side quest that you had, wasn't it, oh, let's play dice for five minutes?
[184:30.42]Yeah.
[184:30.94]Yeah, it was.
[184:31.90]Yeah.
[184:34.56]okay you got spinefall the water crossbow I renamed it the doomsday of doombo interesting alright using I'm about to die by the way it's alright
[185:13.27]What?
[185:13.83]We're in the middle of a battle.
[185:14.93]You need to focus.
[185:16.52]Oh, my one eye.
[185:23.16]Sorry, I got the bucket.
[185:24.60]Alright, I'm going to... Ooh, I can do shackle.
[185:33.03]Sick.
[185:44.74]I just heard these crow sounds.
[185:45.84]I thought that was your character.
[185:48.22]Oh, wait.
[185:48.91]If anything attacks Thomas, you get plus four damage.
[185:52.15]Yeah.
[185:52.57]Really?
[185:52.83]Yeah.
[185:54.23]We've been over this.
[185:55.45]We've got lover's vengeance.
[186:05.44]I think we're just rolling balls of infinite damage.
[186:10.66]We're pretty strong, actually.
[186:11.88]That's what I'm saying, like, let's just wait 300 days.
[186:16.32]No, that would be... Uh-oh.
[186:21.84]I got him.
[186:22.84]You got him?
[186:29.51]Oh my, you killed him in one hit.
[186:31.09]Nice.
[186:32.01]I do have a really big hammer.
[186:37.13]Take this.
[186:38.23]Time for the melee wand.
[186:39.91]Yeah!
[186:44.86]There we go.
[186:52.22]Can I do this through walls?
[186:53.16]Probably not.
[186:53.80]That was a really stupid question.
[186:58.02]No.
[186:59.04]You're not stupid, honey.
[187:01.19]Thanks.
[187:01.47]I appreciate it.
[187:14.83]Dude, Thomas is falling behind.
[187:16.79]I'm alright.
[187:18.99]Ooh, another crit chance.
[187:22.31]We all have a slot, right?
[187:24.89]Yeah, it's going to take you past 20.
[187:26.79]That's pretty good.
[187:27.65]I'll take it.
[187:28.05]It's not color, is it?
[187:34.45]Because we know who that would have been for.
[187:37.67]do you remember do people still do this in wow um I haven't really played it too intently or deeply but I remember back in the day is everyone always agreed that like you you don't need you need you know greed right if you don't need it you just read it or you pass on it right the people is this those people in the five mans that just need every single item this is uh you got a custom quest yeah this is what it is yeah that's what it is okay
[188:04.25]Thomas and Inan are called to a hill village where an acquaintance of theirs has lost her wife.
[188:11.31]After this rain comes, the farms will prosper again.
[188:18.39]Not if there's no farmers left.
[188:21.49]It's been a dry fall, that's all I mean.
[188:26.36]The funerary rites are brief.
[188:28.00]The crowd that's gathered is impressive for such a small town.
[188:33.47]As mourners disperse, Thomas and Inan spot Balad-Chi standing by a flower-strung cart bearing a leaf-shrouded body.
[188:44.63]Balad-Chi, we're sorry to hear about Arthel.
[188:47.99]Who are these people?
[188:49.51]A lot of folks came.
[188:56.53]Do we not... Wait, have we been here before?
[188:59.71]I think we walked through this place during the... Mickey Mouse?
[189:26.06]To help Balachi transfer the shrouded body to a small prepared clay room besides the house.
[189:34.15]They settle inside and she tells them of her plan and of the provincial customs she's observing.
[189:40.91]Oh, gee, green veiling is called.
[189:43.53]A woven shroud of dawnshard.
[189:45.65]Dawnshard grows thick around here.
[189:48.34]In little woodlands, you see, there's a strong aroma.
[189:51.74]The body stays fresh, sometimes as long as four years or five.
[189:55.78]By the way, you are just doing the other voice, but without the wolf on it.
[190:02.32]Oh, yeah, I'm just having a little bit of, I'm just doing this one here.
[190:10.97]There's something very silencing in that.
[190:13.89]I think it's a good tradition.
[190:40.13]But I don't plan on waiting.
[190:44.14]You don't plan to wait?
[190:46.58]So you plan to bury her soon?
[190:48.30]Tonight, even?
[190:50.74]No.
[190:51.79]My wife, Iredithel, and I will be going on a journey.
[190:55.19]And I hope you'll come along.
[190:58.71]Brack.
[191:06.33]A hard sudden rain falls, chittering and droning like a swarm.
[191:11.93]Andy is what they're calling me over here, giving out advice.
[191:15.15]What?
[191:15.81]People are calling me Two Voice Andy, giving out vocal advice.
[191:21.16]They're saying that how I should not be giving you voice tips because I have three voices.
[191:26.98]I mean, you're going to criticize, you're going to come at me and I'm the one, I'm doing it.
[191:31.85]Would you like to take over?
[191:34.37]Yeah.
[191:39.11]Yes, I hoped you'd come.
[191:43.95]Be our escort.
[191:45.59]It's a dangerous world, and you're both strong.
[191:48.11]Stronger than... Stronger than I even remembered.
[191:53.79]Stop doing that to me.
[191:54.87]It's making me angry.
[191:55.63]This doesn't represent me.
[191:58.70]Oh, alright, fine.
[191:59.38]Let's do stirs voices.
[192:00.92]Well, we're here now.
[192:02.56]Come along with you.
[192:03.42]I'm going to get a little bit of protection.
[192:05.38]Me too.
[192:10.54]I have no idea what happened in that whole encounter.
[192:14.67]It was apparently, it's a friend of Thomas, her wife died, and she asked us to escort the body in a wagon.
[192:23.03]Just west of the Nightgrave Threshery, Baldashi leads her oxen cart, carrying the body of her wife down through the hills into the arms of an old forest.
[192:33.84]Mist rolls in as twilight takes hold behind a cloudy sky.
[192:40.81]This forest was named Lagerhead when it was on the maps.
[192:44.50]Absent forest, it meant.
[192:46.72]It's not an encouraging name.
[192:51.42]Can I ask about Arthel?
[192:53.70]I don't think either of us ever met her.
[192:57.89]You missed your other character.
[193:01.53]Place, uh... Place I'm... Place I'm looking for shouldn't be... You do it.
[193:11.84]Oh, that place I'm looking for shouldn't be far.
[193:16.47]I remember you talking about her.
[193:21.97]Oh, I'm sorry.
[193:23.23]She never came with me to sleep in time.
[193:25.37]Always wanted her to, but she was never quiet and well enough.
[193:29.07]And she insisted on staying home to tend the farm.
[193:34.16]We met in the spring.
[193:36.04]I remember clearly.
[193:37.72]My grandma had just passed.
[193:40.52]Sounds like a cue book from Family Guy.
[193:42.84]Yeah.
[193:43.46]What's wrong with that?
[193:46.72]Come here, child.
[193:48.11]There's nothing wrong more precious than a woman who can make you laugh.
[193:52.93]Even when you're hurting.
[193:54.31]We built the farm there on the rocky hill.
[193:59.37]She liked the farm, Martell.
[194:02.97]She was kind and humble woman, shy though.
[194:05.77]She was born with an illness that never fully left.
[194:09.45]Our good times were great.
[194:11.14]She doesn't look kind, humble, or shy.
[194:13.16]She looks like she just beat up a child.
[194:15.30]Yeah.
[194:16.90]They, like, are both in on it, too.
[194:18.26]Like, yeah, fuck, you got him.
[194:19.94]Alright.
[194:22.12]But our bad times, when she couldn't rise from bed, those made my heart splinter.
[194:28.55]And one day, they shattered.
[194:33.08]If there's one thing I know, it's that I don't want to live in that empty house without her.
[194:40.01]The forest had been dead quiet when they entered.
[194:43.79]As they've gone deeper, noises have filtered into hearing.
[194:47.11]Drips, scrapes, low trills.
[194:52.16]The smells have turned richer of damp Earth, spicy bark, quilted mosses in purple, green, and beige.
[195:00.59]Soon, the ox halts.
[195:03.41]They come into a clearing where a goddess lives.
[195:07.35]Oh!
[195:10.68]Beladshi?
[195:15.38]Yes, I intend to find her.
[195:16.88]The reason I thought Ardathel was here.
[195:19.06]The reason I'm here and you're here.
[195:21.61]Arui?
[195:25.23]She's a goddess of borders and in-betweens.
[195:28.13]This realm of hers welcomes both the dead and the living.
[195:32.47]So I'm here to join her.
[195:34.86]Slip my fucking throat.
[195:38.78]Well, actually, you have to slow down.
[195:40.88]Clearly this idea's been germinating for some time.
[195:44.14]Jerma, what?
[195:48.07]Look, it's this virus.
[195:49.53]I read about it.
[195:50.31]This goddess rules it.
[195:54.12]But isn't it just like dying yourself?
[195:55.77]Crossing over to be together?
[196:19.40]I won't be able to leave this place.
[196:21.68]But why would I wish to?
[196:23.92]I'll still live.
[196:26.05]She will too.
[196:27.05]We'll just live here.
[196:27.89]You have to understand, this is what I want.
[196:33.13]All I need for you is to help me complete the ceremony and take the Barrocks back with you.
[196:39.45]I did not expect this character was going to have this much dialog for you to do.
[196:43.12]So much dialog.
[196:45.08]You are monologuing as this.
[196:47.46]Holy shit.
[196:49.48]But I'm committed to the role.
[196:50.62]I do want the callback.
[196:51.83]Is that so bad?
[196:52.63]Okay.
[196:52.81]Alright.
[196:54.23]Put yourself in my position.
[197:00.31]Okay.
[197:01.91]This is your choice.
[197:05.75]I mean, we can't just throw your life behind.
[197:10.20]No, we can't.
[197:12.52]My body, my choice.
[197:14.18]We can't.
[197:17.60]What do you mean you can't let me?
[197:22.32]We're not in the business of letting friends die by any name, by their choice or not.
[197:27.92]I know you feel this is the only way.
[197:32.53]But why?
[197:33.66]What proof do you have that it'll work?
[197:35.98]Do you think this goddess will demand nothing else from you?
[197:41.38]Proof?
[197:42.60]Well, in the books.
[197:44.61]I read a manga once.
[197:46.87]You're not doing this today.
[197:48.49]That's a starting point, isn't it?
[197:51.81]All that matters is today.
[197:55.30]Arthel...
[197:59.40]Silent minutes slip by.
[198:01.30]They pass without motion, save for the roll of mist, the blink of damp eyelids, the fall of silver-struck tears.
[198:08.42]Finally, Beladshi raises her head and addresses the shrine at her back.
[198:16.07]Dear goddess, I'm sorry.
[198:18.33]Today I'll leave your wood to your own.
[198:22.99]I'll... Let me be back.
[198:27.32]They turn the ox around, but... Surprising and slow, a low, long-stretched sound coils from the stones, the roots, the Earth.
[198:41.44]Balaji?
[198:41.96]I don't know.
[198:46.18]As it speaks, something huge crashes through the trees.
[198:53.87]What?
[198:55.73]Please stay.
[198:57.07]It's a retainer of the old god.
[199:00.91]It's going to kill us, man.
[199:01.87]It's going to keep us here and we're going to die.
[199:03.79]So wait, is this thing... What is this thing?
[199:06.52]I don't know.
[199:08.04]The stones that were part of the shrine came to life and it demanded that we stay.
[199:13.06]So I think it's trying to kill us.
[199:14.94]Oh, shit.
[199:15.66]Alright.
[199:17.88]Let's go.
[199:22.15]The wizard runs at the giant beast.
[199:25.51]He's gonna kill me!
[199:28.89]I'm getting out of here, I'm getting out of here.
[199:30.17]Love is vengeance.
[199:45.83]I'm just imagining somebody during this screaming, Jesus Christ!
[199:50.36]It's like, you're aware of different, I don't know, the villain is... They leave the forest behind.
[199:57.64]I can't with this fucking segment.
[200:02.36]The last light lingers.
[200:04.16]This time of year.
[200:06.24]This is your side quest, by the way.
[200:07.56]It's not even been about you at all.
[200:09.30]You think we upset her, the goddess?
[200:14.75]At least one of us should be getting back.
[200:17.06]But one of us could stay.
[200:36.78]I thought she seems to be developing a habit.
[200:38.71]Oh, you want to be in the right now?
[200:39.77]No, I don't.
[200:41.01]I thought it was her talking.
[200:42.63]No, you interjected and now you must leave.
[200:44.63]I'm glad she seems to be developing a habit for silence.
[200:49.13]But then she sighs.
[200:51.92]I think I will bury her.
[200:56.06]I mean, I mean, come on.
[200:57.86]I'm trying to murder myself and slaying the god beast.
[201:01.35]I think I might just bury her.
[201:05.39]I'm grateful to you.
[201:06.51]I'll keep in touch.
[201:07.55]And, oh, well, what can I really promise?
[201:15.81]And so you guys leave.
[201:17.35]Okay.
[201:18.39]She returns to her normal life and buries her loved one.
[201:21.26]Okay.
[201:25.88]Oh.
[201:27.78]It's hard to let the good things go.
[201:31.66]Yeah.
[201:32.50]Wishes come true, but not always forever.
[201:37.32]Friends are useful, then, I guess.
[201:39.42]They pull you along when you just want to lie down in the road.
[201:45.04]Oh, along us.
[201:46.38]Wherever you are, maybe time to start looking into immortality.
[201:51.23]The wind picks up.
[201:52.81]They take their time returning home.
[201:57.15]Oh, we got some fucking hot wood.
[201:59.13]We took our clothes.
[202:00.88]We got some hot wood.
[202:02.22]Thomas leveled up.
[202:03.66]Oh, I did.
[202:04.10]Alright.
[202:06.81]Ooh.
[202:10.54]I'm not doing that.
[202:12.28]Maybe naturalist?
[202:14.24]You could reroll these if they're kind of weak.
[202:16.98]Oh, infuse ranging.
[202:18.22]Actually, I like this.
[202:20.18]I feel like I'm a little too far away sometimes.
[202:23.82]Yeah, I like that.
[202:25.30]Okay.
[202:27.46]Let's head to Mist and Timberland then.
[202:29.36]Push on.
[202:31.71]We move on.
[202:33.63]We press on.
[202:39.74]By the way, I kind of had a moment back there.
[202:42.34]When I was giving you shit for doing every voice like this, everybody in my chat was saying, what about, like, Goku?
[202:48.95]And if you don't know... I do that, too.
[202:50.69]Everybody talks like this.
[202:51.97]Everybody sounds like Mr. Satan.
[202:53.73]I just do a variation of that, so I'm full of shit.
[202:56.83]Everyone has two voices.
[202:57.97]Yeah, guys, everyone has two voices.
[203:10.22]Alright.
[203:15.66]Well, rumors of Gorgons have led the Bats and the Fabulous Four through Tangled Woods to the site of a long-forgotten ruse.
[203:23.49]Windborne rock and decayed edifices are all that remain of this ancient city.
[203:31.05]Even the locals don't know who used to live here.
[203:35.03]Petrified rat over here.
[203:36.59]Nice of him to leave us a trail.
[203:40.54]Wonder what lured them all the way out here.
[203:42.40]I forgot that your character looked like that.
[203:48.34]It's been so long.
[203:49.78]The dead.
[204:10.70]Sometimes it's easy to forget they were real people.
[204:14.99]Ordinary.
[204:15.91]Most of them.
[204:16.99]Probably.
[204:17.43]That's because you're a narcissist.
[204:22.49]You know, with all the usual hopes and fears and everyday concerns.
[204:31.17]Thousands of feet must have trodden these streets every day, exchanging good and information.
[204:39.57]And those must have been houses.
[204:41.57]Not too fancy, but... The space a man calls his own.
[204:45.07]I'm just... You've been doing that.
[204:46.45]I'm doing your voice now.
[204:47.95]The space a man calls his own doesn't have to be.
[204:54.43]Maybe we switch.
[204:55.81]You want to switch?
[204:56.53]Okay, let's switch it up.
[204:59.37]You've given it a lot of thought, love.
[205:01.56]Wonder what kind of lives we could have lived if we'd settled in a place like this.
[205:08.90]I'm an intimidation guy Yeah
[205:44.77]They've worked.
[205:48.41]Oh, enemies suffer two damage.
[205:52.61]Oh, nice.
[205:53.07]Alright.
[205:53.29]Where are they?
[205:58.90]Yeah, where is everybody?
[205:59.72]Oh, they're up top.
[206:02.74]Reveled.
[206:11.73]Ooh, how?
[206:24.43]What the fuck is your name again, Alungus?
[206:27.32]Alungus Bolognese.
[206:29.06]It's like a Bungus, but Alungus.
[206:31.53]Is your name actually Alungus Bolognese?
[206:34.01]Yeah.
[206:35.60]No, isn't it Alungus Bolognese?
[206:40.61]I feel like, I feel like you wrote that in for like president at like an election.
[206:47.13]Like, I know I'm going to vote for Alungus Bologna.
[206:50.04]That's who I'm voting for this year.
[206:51.50]I hit random and it was Alungus.
[206:55.04]And I had to change it to Alungus.
[206:58.60]It just had to.
[207:00.08]I'm sorry.
[207:08.43]Alright, I'm close enough now.
[207:09.47]You're pretty strong, guys.
[207:10.91]We actually are very strong.
[207:12.71]It's pretty sick.
[207:18.02]Oh!
[207:19.08]Watch out now.
[207:21.88]What?
[207:23.06]It didn't hit anybody.
[207:23.70]You have so much armor as well.
[207:32.13]One of my level ups was just +2 armor.
[207:33.73]Yeah, you're taking all these.
[207:48.40]Here we go.
[207:49.66]That's what I wanted to have happen last time.
[207:51.28]I can kill that one.
[208:02.30]I have a plan.
[208:10.84]Wait, I thought I'd bump into the other one.
[208:12.67]Damn.
[208:14.01]Oh, was it one tile back further?
[208:16.35]Yeah.
[208:17.78]He's running!
[208:21.96]Destroyed.
[208:24.14]You activated my trap card.
[208:27.74]We gotta level up?
[208:29.66]Oh, we do for Alongus.
[208:31.51]Yeah, it's Alongus Bolognese.
[208:33.05]That's your name.
[208:34.59]Wait, you can learn to fly now?
[208:38.11]Swift action.
[208:38.83]And 25 dodge.
[208:47.70]Like you could do melee for your rapier.
[208:51.88]Dude, that whole battle, you just threw some rocks.
[208:55.21]Damage.
[208:55.67]I mean, I got the bite and the claw and the ring of rhythm.
[209:01.20]Uh, either of you two upgrades your speed.
[209:03.38]Mine.
[209:04.16]You should take it, yeah.
[209:05.64]Wait, let me get this straight.
[209:06.32]People are saying that all I did was throw rocks at people.
[209:08.09]Um, you don't think it'd be impressive if somebody broke up a pillar, turned it into three... With their mind.
[209:13.23]With their mind, turned it into three different discs, and they flew out and homing missile hit three different enemies in the head?
[209:19.33]Sorry, I didn't, um, cast a lightning bolt out of my hands.
[209:24.58]As their breathing stills, they hear the chittering of birds, the buzz of bees, overgrown grasses rustle in the breeze.
[209:31.72]that rhymed not far from where they fought a section of the flagstone appears to be coming up Thomas pries some away with his toe
[209:56.75]Uncovering what appears to be a way below.
[209:58.99]Oh, I'm moving away.
[210:00.90]Large and muscular toe there, Thomas.
[210:03.92]With a little more effort, they widen out an entrance.
[210:08.02]How deep is it?
[210:09.46]Oh, I was in the zone.
[210:11.36]How deep is it?
[210:13.62]Stairs.
[210:15.18]These stairs go down.
[210:18.71]Gotta check it out, right?
[210:20.47]Any good reason not to?
[210:24.47]down they climb into the ancient city's underbelly slimy things skitter away at their approach a rancid odor hangs in the air torch over here let me just in a splash of light their surroundings take color and shape the passage opens up to a small enclosure an oval room bits of the rotted wood and matted straw form the pale suggestion of a bed at one end
[210:53.01]Oh, smells, doesn't it?
[210:57.43]I was expecting a crypt or a storehouse, not somebody's dusty old bedchamber.
[211:05.00]Wonder why they're here beneath the city.
[211:10.60]Scattered around the room are what remain of a life's possessions.
[211:14.87]Most are decayed or moth-eaten beyond recognition.
[211:19.22]That's a garment of some kind.
[211:21.76]Clay fragments, pottery pieces.
[211:24.45]I see something over here too.
[211:26.49]If the Gorgons found this place, I'm guessing they didn't see anything worth taking.
[211:32.47]I can't tell if you gave up on switching.
[211:34.49]I kind of did.
[211:35.27]He's just slightly older, so there's like a gruffness to it.
[211:37.63]Well, we switched.
[211:38.51]So he switched to the dog, did it for like one line.
[211:40.47]Yeah, but now he switched back.
[211:41.23]He switched back.
[211:41.67]And then he was like, wait a second.
[211:42.98]Like, this isn't fun to do for like four hours.
[211:45.58]Yeah, I came to that conclusion pretty quickly.
[211:47.58]Yeah, yeah.
[211:48.30]Like anyone would.
[211:49.02]Any sane person would come to that conclusion.
[211:50.50]Really like judgmental.
[211:53.88]But there's one item that catches Thomas's eye.
[211:56.26]A small bone flute set atop a stone pedestal.
[211:58.98]Alone, it seems like to have survived the passage of years unmarred.
[212:05.49]Moon-colored, its surface is smooth, polished by the press of ancient fingertips.
[212:10.75]It begs to be held again.
[212:14.83]There's a look I know well.
[212:16.29]Oh, I... Shut up.
[212:23.14]This thing, it's in one piece at least.
[212:25.58]Not that it's anything special.
[212:27.62]It sort of catches my attention.
[212:28.98]I can't help wondering what it sounded like.
[212:34.18]Who played it?
[212:35.14]And who listened?
[212:35.80]The way it's placed.
[212:40.16]I think it was treasured by the hands that held it.
[212:42.75]Well looked after.
[212:48.65]You're taking the flute.
[212:49.43]We know you're taking the flute.
[212:50.89]Yep.
[212:52.82]Ooh.
[212:54.04]Ooh, plus 15 charisma.
[212:57.48]I'll take it.
[212:58.64]Yeah, grab it.
[213:02.20]Hell yeah.
[213:05.80]Nice bone flute.
[213:07.64]Thomas moves forward and carefully plucks the flute from its stand.
[213:13.25]It's not doing anything down here except gathering dust.
[213:16.09]Those who made it, you think they'd want that?
[213:21.84]They put out the torch make their way back to the surface and seal the passage behind them You can't even play it with a wolf mouth
[213:50.48]Yeah, how would you play that?
[213:52.20]Damn it.
[213:53.46]Damn these wolf lips.
[213:54.96]And then I stand up there and I'm like... And then we all know who won.
[214:01.12]Alright, let's build a bridge.
[214:10.21]How many more days?
[214:10.73]280... 285 days!
[214:14.22]I'm telling you, dude.
[214:14.88]I'm telling you, man.
[214:17.23]We need to just, like, hang out at the bar for, like, two years.
[214:22.45]No way, man.
[214:23.15]Look, I think this is the thing we're off.
[214:24.93]We need to get to the altar.
[214:25.97]Yeah.
[214:26.71]Yeah.
[214:27.19]We're nearly there.
[214:28.33]Okay.
[214:28.49]Well, then we get to the altar and then we, like, camp out.
[214:31.70]It's like we have tickets first.
[214:35.23]Somebody said, I hope something bad happens to your character so it's more interesting.
[214:40.18]What the heck?
[214:41.28]Yeah, your character has gone relatively untouched by anything.
[214:46.44]I'm just sort of a normal guy that just is like kind of here hanging out with my spells.
[214:51.40]Okay, what difficulty is this?
[214:52.66]Five?
[214:53.22]Should we patrol or should we just go for it?
[214:57.00]I think we go for it.
[214:59.21]We're slamming it.
[215:00.17]We cannot be stopped.
[215:01.91]This is the final fight of the chapter.
[215:03.69]When this fight is over, the chapter will end.
[215:05.34]Make sure you are ready.
[215:06.56]Let's go.
[215:06.98]Let's do it.
[215:10.74]Normal guy and his furry wolf husband.
[215:14.88]Oh, look at this.
[215:16.24]It wasn't imagined to be so picturesque.
[215:20.87]Have we decided who gets the spear yet?
[215:23.15]A towering, reeking of algae and old water, it stalks sedately on its stony limbs while the world quakes.
[215:30.95]It's called the Calabine.
[215:32.87]What?
[215:34.08]It has 22 health, is immune to compulsion, it crushes any scenery it touches.
[215:39.12]Yeah, we are not seeing whatever you're seeing.
[215:40.30]It has massive sweeping attacks.
[215:42.12]Wait, you're not on the map?
[215:43.50]No, we're on like a whole like, we're still reading.
[215:47.81]Oh, I skipped that entirely for some reason.
[215:51.91]I never got the reading.
[215:53.09]Oh, we're at the door.
[215:55.65]I'm going to watch your stream.
[215:57.51]Oh, I just joined.
[215:59.69]Oh, my goodness.
[216:00.32]This thing is huge.
[216:02.22]Want me to help?
[216:02.74]We're going to kill it in one turn.
[216:04.42]I need to get in here so I can fuse.
[216:16.38]Let me fuse with this.
[216:19.16]He's such a good fusion.
[216:20.68]I'm biting it.
[216:23.27]Uh-oh.
[216:24.35]Can you back up, sir?
[216:26.44]No, I can't.
[216:26.94]I've already attacked.
[216:27.88]Okay.
[216:28.12]He just lit him on fire.
[216:34.42]Okay.
[216:35.80]We're getting a divorce.
[216:43.41]Oh, going right next to the other one.
[216:46.71]Ugh.
[216:50.13]I did say if you could move and you went like, I don't wanna.
[216:55.59]Oh, and love is vengeance.
[216:58.85]All part of the plan.
[217:00.43]Alright, let's get what we came for.
[217:01.93]Jesus Christ.
[217:04.87]Don't you wonder if that thing lived down there where it came from.
[217:10.42]The air in the chamber is clear and almost sweet.
[217:12.20]The corpse of the great guardian shrivels inside its carapace.
[217:18.89]Inon approaches the edifice.
[217:20.33]The spear is glass-like grand.
[217:22.69]It radiates legacy and power.
[217:26.57]It's just strange.
[217:27.95]What can this thing really mean to them?
[217:31.87]The bow is an oral heirloom.
[217:34.11]My guess is that the hero queen who wielded this lance in antiquity was actually a Gorgon.
[217:41.18]So it's kind of an emblem to them, maybe, of a past hero.
[217:50.12]As Inan grips the spear, a noise begins to grow in the outer tunnels.
[217:53.68]It's the noise of feet and hooves, of tortured lungs shoveling air, and the slickering squelch of scraping things.
[218:02.55]Water.
[218:04.01]By the sound of it, a horde of Gorgon beasts is pouring towards the chamber.
[218:07.97]Are you crying?
[218:10.73]If this story was not that moving...
[218:17.86]We need to hope they don't call for escape.
[218:20.06]I don't think we'll survive if we stay here.
[218:24.31]Holy shit!
[218:25.77]Look at that thing.
[218:26.45]Eight damage, great spin.
[218:29.67]I do have an empty slot.
[218:31.81]That thing looks pretty great.
[218:33.87]I shall take it.
[218:37.10]Uh-oh.
[218:41.68]Where are they coming from?
[218:42.80]Escape the Gorgons.
[218:44.02]We got a whole cave.
[218:47.22]Is there a whole cave here?
[218:48.84]Yeah, back the other way.
[218:50.22]Ah.
[218:51.80]There's a door down here.
[218:56.21]What if we just primed into XP?
[218:58.97]We could.
[219:00.87]But you're not a gamer, so you don't want to do that.
[219:03.21]I need to get my gear score up for the dragon expansion.
[219:07.86]What do you even know about gear score?
[219:11.42]What do you even know about eye level?
[219:12.96]Tell me.
[219:13.68]I have to get my light level up.
[219:14.90]Alright, Gemma, you'll do it right now.
[219:18.25]Awful noises and rank smells rush out of the dark.
[219:30.53]He doesn't care anymore.
[219:31.45]I can tell.
[219:31.73]Oh, they're talking so much shit.
[219:32.87]You have no idea.
[219:35.80]They're having a field day right now.
[219:37.26]I'm making fun of you.
[219:48.80]God, does this guy really think that he's a dog?
[219:50.94]They keep going, omega low, omega low, Ster his voice, omega low, awful, cringe.
[219:55.11]I keep saying, it's like, if you type, if you go, if you type in like logs, and you look up like how many times like Ster and cringe were in the same sentence, it's like 60, 70,000.
[220:01.59]Don't listen to him.
[220:02.85]Don't be swayed.
[220:03.45]-2, -2, -2.
[220:06.01]If I leave you alone, you'll love again, won't you?
[220:08.57]No.
[220:11.45]Love, he's got it.
[220:13.62]Our way might still be open.
[220:15.80]Let's avoid as much fighting as we can.
[220:19.03]Escape is the only option.
[220:22.89]Okay, that's what we got to get to.
[220:26.89]Oh, dog.
[220:37.49]LOL.
[220:38.27]LOL.
[220:39.61]They can't even perceive me.
[220:41.17]I'm unperceivable.
[220:41.95]Uh-oh.
[220:47.91]I get... Uh-oh.
[220:50.11]You're actually kind of surrounded here.
[220:56.58]I am intangible.
[221:03.02]You just leaving?
[221:04.14]I am leaving.
[221:05.16]Yo, look at that jump.
[221:05.92]That was sick.
[221:06.58]That was sick.
[221:08.80]We kind of need you, man.
[221:09.68]Where are you going?
[221:11.20]You're kind of dooming us to death.
[221:13.52]I was just kidding.
[221:15.32]People didn't say cringe.
[221:16.50]They were like, I love this voice.
[221:17.94]I swear I'm not making it up.
[221:21.06]I've been carrying this marriage for 5, 10, 15 years.
[221:24.40]Let's see how he does without me.
[221:32.38]Okay.
[221:34.50]He left!
[221:36.14]What?
[221:37.10]He actually left.
[221:38.46]Wait, you actually left?
[221:40.18]He's gone.
[221:40.44]He extracted.
[221:41.92]Now, if we don't go out, we die.
[221:45.54]He just dodged it.
[221:46.20]Oh my god.
[221:48.27]That's really bad.
[221:49.17]It's really bad that he left.
[221:51.86]you doing what are you why what's with the sabotage dude we're gonna die we're actually gonna die no we're not no what have you done we're not we're okay we're okay you need to double move just run just just run we have to run move as far as you can okay oh this is bad
[222:20.60]Oh, that's bad.
[222:21.34]This is actually not going to be a good... I think he got me.
[222:26.47]You can move.
[222:26.83]I think you can move.
[222:29.81]Oh, no.
[222:32.73]Okay.
[222:33.69]Don't go that way.
[222:34.59]Why not?
[222:36.31]Wait, that's not the right way.
[222:37.23]Oh, it's alright.
[222:38.42]You need to go down.
[222:39.06]You need to go down.
[222:39.68]It's okay.
[222:40.02]It's okay.
[222:40.28]It's okay.
[222:40.66]I think I can make it from here.
[222:42.24]As long as the guy doesn't turn around and hit me.
[222:49.23]That was big.
[222:53.10]Okay, just don't spawn in front of me.
[222:54.30]You are so dead.
[222:57.04]Oh, the dodge.
[222:58.24]Dodge again.
[222:58.68]Oh!
[223:02.68]Wait, you might be okay.
[223:03.62]I think he's blocking.
[223:05.79]No!
[223:05.97]Thomas!
[223:06.45]Ow!
[223:06.75]Ow!
[223:12.88]Focus on surviving nothing more I can do Maybe I'll get an interesting character character edition If I do this
[223:42.25]He runs.
[223:42.71]Hopefully the battle can be won without him.
[223:44.79]Maybe I'll lose my nose or maybe I'll lose some of my hair.
[223:48.43]Alone, he staunches his wounds.
[223:51.78]One gash.
[223:52.86]Particularly deep.
[223:54.92]That's gonna leave a scar.
[223:56.88]A character-defining scar.
[223:58.82]Character-defining scar.
[224:00.28]Let's go.
[224:02.84]You have to make it out too, though.
[224:05.14]Yeah.
[224:16.57]Come on, you can do it.
[224:19.09]You're not much further.
[224:19.77]I've already had a wound.
[224:20.67]If I go down, it might be game over.
[224:23.77]Oh, shit.
[224:26.47]This actually is bad.
[224:30.03]I don't understand.
[224:30.67]You just walked to the exit.
[224:37.24]Scream.
[224:38.32]Oh, no.
[224:38.96]He sees the shadow of his foe.
[224:41.74]He knows what's coming.
[224:43.66]He can lean a little to one side or the other, but it won't change much.
[224:49.51]He feels something.
[224:50.89]A heaviness in his hand.
[224:52.25]It has a name.
[224:53.97]The petri-glass sea spear.
[224:56.27]There's a story, maybe, that it wants to tell.
[225:00.88]And only a sliver of opportunity left to tell it.
[225:06.55]I can choose to break the spear or take -2 health for the rest of the campaign.
[225:11.86]The main quest item?
[225:13.90]Don't we need that thing?
[225:16.51]I will take the health.
[225:21.97]indecision grips him the blow lands he tumbles to the ground gravely wounded and clutching his weapon in the end he couldn't choose to part with it even if it meant paying the price himself oh no Ster you have us I what have you done he has just enough strength to retreat and we'll spend the next days tending to his wounds head propped up at his bedside petroglass sea spear will wait until he's ready to take it up again and let it sing
[225:56.23]Dude, look at the scar on my eye.
[225:57.60]Let's salvage this.
[226:00.40]We don't need it.
[226:05.08]I don't think anyone needs this.
[226:06.84]Alright, Mystic.
[226:08.80]There it is.
[226:10.54]See, now I get to talk like this.
[226:12.91]The rest of the campaign.
[226:14.97]Look at your scar!
[226:16.13]Yeah.
[226:17.46]Once per turn, you can pull a mote of heat out of the air and create fire any way you want.
[226:23.11]I'm doing that one.
[226:25.55]What's mine?
[226:26.09]I don't care.
[226:28.97]I don't give a shit anymore.
[226:29.99]I don't fucking care.
[226:42.31]This has to be... You're the only one alive.
[226:44.69]Stop.
[226:45.68]ah we all of us together left that canyon and cave behind the enemy's treasure in our hands it almost broke we should be joyful but we know a clash is coming my books claim wars are one piece by piece trapped by trapped winning one hill doesn't decide anything
[227:10.27]We can only hope this small victory buys us time.
[227:12.91]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[227:14.07]Don't you think that it's each one of us is saying one of those lines?
[227:19.72]Yeah, I think so.
[227:20.64]Yeah, so.
[227:21.98]We can only hope this small victory buys us time.
[227:29.67]You're a fucking traitor.
[227:32.42]The game has crashed.
[227:34.24]Your game has crashed.
[227:34.81]Wait, really?
[227:35.63]Yeah, at the end of every chapter.
[227:38.07]I guess that's the first time it happened.
[227:39.91]It happened to me last time.
[227:40.97]No, I can still see everything.
[227:42.85]Ten years of peace follow.
[227:44.55]Okay.
[227:46.89]Cool.
[227:47.01]Take it away.
[227:47.50]Click next at the top.
[227:49.60]Nice.
[227:50.80]How many chapters are there?
[227:54.02]Five.
[227:54.78]Okay.
[227:54.90]If you look in the top left.
[227:57.08]Wait, that might not be it.
[227:57.86]I'm actually not sure.
[228:00.69]Oh, this is during the years of peace.
[228:05.08]So what happened?
[228:05.90]I don't I don't.
[228:06.60]Oh, there it is.
[228:10.52]Alungus carried one of the large bedroll upon his back.
[228:16.67]Thomas, a jug of wine on his and they snuck off to the hills for some time to enjoy the views and each other's company.
[228:24.07]OK, you forgave me.
[228:27.97]And on would only find excuses to visit Humble Top Smelter.
[228:33.24]His pan wouldn't sit flat.
[228:34.58]His fire poker wasn't pokey enough.
[228:36.60]Whatever the reason, it had absolutely nothing to do with the strikingly beautiful smith who sometimes brought her work there.
[228:44.55]I give her the eyes.
[228:46.79]She did not have red hair.
[228:47.87]It's not going to last.
[228:49.31]True.
[228:50.21]Alungus went to the word hero index one day to research his family name.
[228:56.68]Apparently, disappearing into the shadows was a running theme.
[229:02.84]I wonder.
[229:03.04]Plus, they give the bats of the Fabulous Four a great discount.
[229:06.10]How many days straight have you worn that thing?
[229:07.53]Yeah, I watched it.
[229:25.17]An on fell for shepherds.
[229:27.39]A different lady?
[229:28.27]The smith is... I told you.
[229:29.71]I was down bad, dude.
[229:32.29]Wait, is this a different person?
[229:34.53]Hand in hand, they would follow the flock for hours in contended silence.
[229:43.58]What?
[229:43.90]You have a son?
[229:44.74]I have a son!
[229:46.44]Has reached adventuring age, and he's a fucking wizard.
[229:49.73]He's joined our group.
[229:51.39]Anvar Proud has joined the Bats of the Fabulous Four as a mystic.
[229:55.55]Hold on, we already have a mystic.
[229:57.93]I think, um... He's young and spry, and he's eager to earn...
[230:02.97]Wait!
[230:03.89]Along us is Thomas' son.
[230:05.13]Wait, alright.
[230:06.53]Dakin has joined the pack since I was four as a warrior.
[230:09.57]Wait, Dakin?
[230:12.82]You guys had a son.
[230:13.90]He doesn't even have a single wolf arm.
[230:16.82]There's no wolf?
[230:17.46]He has a wolf soul.
[230:20.50]Oh.
[230:22.74]Okay.
[230:23.34]Okay.
[230:25.94]He has a wolf soul.
[230:28.44]Yeah, he does.
[230:30.96]okay what do you guys want to give dakin I feel like I feel like this guy just every now and again when he's eating it's like he only eats meat he only eats meat that's how you know oh it's what is it is it a warrior yeah you gotta level him up what is he what's his starting thing uh Ster what are you I don't he's a raider you made him a raider wait you're transforming again you got a bird leg dude you got bird feet
[230:58.79]Yes.
[231:00.59]A crow's leg.
[231:02.25]You're a mess.
[231:04.47]Achievement unlocked.
[231:05.37]I did it.
[231:11.12]I feel like there was a game like the Wii where you put different monster parts all over the character and then you battled with them.
[231:21.01]For the Wii?
[231:21.45]I know what you're thinking of.
[231:23.55]Impossible Creatures, we played that together.
[231:27.97]I mean, Spore?
[231:28.69]Spore is pretty close, yeah.
[231:30.47]There was one for the Wii, too.
[231:33.98]Monster Lab, yep.
[231:38.52]What are we doing with our points?
[231:41.16]Yeah, what are we doing?
[231:45.41]I mean, I'm...
[231:47.18]I'm not long for this body, so I don't think it would be appropriate to change anything.
[231:52.21]Do you want to put stock in your son?
[231:55.11]I honestly want our children to just jump off a cliff.
[231:59.11]I don't want them in our adventuring party.
[232:00.79]Can we leave them at home?
[232:02.29]I want them to have the life that I couldn't have.
[232:06.80]Yeah, the adventuring life is not for them, I feel.
[232:12.28]Okay, alright.
[232:14.69]well let's let's see how they do we have to see how the how these two do I'm gonna see how they do I mean what we're just gonna they're ready to fight they're ready to join the the party the moment that my son takes narrative like priority over me I'm gonna flip out okay we need to give Thomas a new oh my god he can learn the giga great stuff tier three mythic stuff
[232:42.70]Holy shit.
[232:43.18]Or we can give you a tier two, and then we can give... We can also give a long ass tier two stuff as well.
[232:50.10]You know what?
[232:50.38]Let's go tier two.
[232:50.98]I don't want to take all the points.
[232:52.60]Okay.
[232:52.90]Do you want... Are you looking at the... Do you want a mage staff, or do you want to stick with the wand?
[232:58.63]I wonder what would be better for what I have right now.
[233:02.53]They're the same, except wands give you plus one magic armor, and staffs give you plus 50 in block chance.
[233:10.39]Hmm.
[233:12.94]I'll do the magic armor.
[233:15.16]Okay.
[233:15.84]Tier 2 wand then.
[233:17.68]Yeah, because what do I have right now?
[233:19.58]You got a tier 1 wand.
[233:21.60]Yeah, let's get the tier 2.
[233:23.16]Okay.
[233:23.54]Tier 2 wand upgrade.
[233:25.54]Mm-hmm.
[233:26.98]Boom.
[233:27.24]Yes.
[233:27.88]And then for a long ass, you want tier 2 rapier or do you want tier 2 bow?
[233:35.61]Probably get both.
[233:43.16]Along us?
[233:43.96]Any thoughts?
[233:45.18]No, I think my arm's going to get replaced, and I'm not going to be able to hold weapons anymore.
[233:49.60]So I don't want to upgrade them.
[233:51.12]Oh, you want to upgrade your armor?
[233:53.32]Yeah, you're going to get like a frog arm, and you won't be able to grip the sword anymore.
[233:55.93]You could go tier two, this armor here, or this one up here.
[233:59.31]This one looks kind of cool.
[234:05.07]This one, this top armor gives you plus 25 dodge, which would probably go, yeah, do that one.
[234:12.89]This sword is so cool and powerful.
[234:19.25]That's an interesting way to describe that.
[234:21.51]You're reading my weapon description?
[234:23.15]Well, none shall stand before the wielder.
[234:24.92]You automatically win every single fight you enter and nobody can stop you.
[234:27.44]It also doubles as a gun.
[234:28.88]What the fuck is this weapon?
[234:30.84]So strong and unstoppable.
[234:32.38]Oh, you wrote this!
[234:33.86]Okay, I was like, what the hell is this?
[234:38.78]Yeah, if you think you need a gun, yeah.
[234:41.86]Okay.
[234:43.44]Alright, so what's next?
[234:45.62]Alright, Jeremy, you want to be our new narrator?
[234:47.64]Sure.
[234:49.02]The rains had some storms batter compromise into combative neighbors.
[234:55.52]Grudges are no shelter in bitter weather.
[235:01.64]Oh, I'll press it.
[235:04.32]The rains had been falling for a full week with brief interludes of tense massing clouds and dripping branches.
[235:12.15]Mountain snows, melted in water, roared from the heights.
[235:17.55]The seas whirled and rung at the shores, flung waves ever further.
[235:25.04]Rivers conquered their banks and marched wider.
[235:27.94]Valleys turned to huge brackish lakes.
[235:31.06]Lowland woods and the dams of dry times were swept away, as creatures of all shapes and kinds sought escape from churning floods.
[235:47.04]I think you have to add some crow to it now.
[235:52.48]Yeah, and you're also like 30 plus years older right now, aren't you?
[235:57.22]Yeah, we're like in our 50s.
[235:59.18]Okay, let me... Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?
[236:04.45]Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire, Harry?
[236:06.01]Did you?
[236:11.31]I don't know.
[236:11.99]I already sound old.
[236:14.57]Yeah, you do sound old.
[236:21.50]We're not doing this.
[236:22.24]Don't do this.
[236:25.98]After all this time, why now with wood?
[236:32.89]There's no rational explanation for this confluence of catastrophes.
[236:40.83]Rain.
[236:42.18]Rain.
[236:42.46]Old people.
[236:44.42]Demons.
[236:45.66]Nothing's ever made sense about this.
[236:48.30]But, oh, someone's at a door.
[236:54.82]The strange party of visitors begs a fire.
[236:58.97]They appear to be on the edge, here in a common dwelling.
[237:02.29]And also very soggy.
[237:06.33]Arnon, you know we're dangerous, right?
[237:08.87]Why are you here?
[237:12.76]The haggard man behind the horns calls himself Arnon.
[237:16.14]Anon.
[237:17.20]Takes a long breath and turns to address Alongus and the rest.
[237:20.58]The fucking goofy son is in the frame.
[237:22.96]Ask my wife!
[237:27.42]That's a punchline.
[237:28.68]That's perfect.
[237:30.20]Huh?
[237:30.54]What?
[237:30.78]We don't get the joke.
[237:34.54]Ask my wife, she sent me.
[237:36.65]Can you believe that?
[237:38.23]At my advanced age, a gloppy and serpent sable, you know, looks different.
[237:50.92]Must be about the flooding.
[237:52.88]Huh?
[237:58.10]You know why the... No, everyone knows.
[238:03.05]It's those Tentaclasts, the Gorgons.
[238:06.25]They bring ruin on us all.
[238:10.69]And... Which Gorgons?
[238:12.78]They're blue.
[238:16.36]That checks out.
[238:18.04]But I mean, who's their...
[238:24.39]The Gorgons are flooding the world.
[238:27.45]They've set it in motion and it can't be stopped.
[238:30.41]Almost.
[238:37.34]How?
[238:39.12]None of this should be possible.
[238:41.98]I mean, the rain, the rails, and the sea.
[238:47.60]Oh, I like that.
[238:48.10]That's the Odofield vibe.
[238:49.76]You're right.
[238:50.88]It shouldn't be.
[238:51.80]The Great Balance should be unassailable.
[238:57.75]But somehow, they've thrown it over.
[239:02.79]So the torrents fall, the seas thrush.
[239:05.15]The soil seems blacked out, our warrens.
[239:10.98]It's Ulstrix.
[239:12.46]I knew it would be.
[239:13.90]Ulstrix?
[239:15.02]No, it's the Gorgons, I'm saying.
[239:19.96]The beasts have our Warren hemmed in.
[239:22.62]My wife's inside, dry and warm.
[239:25.06]You need to talk to her.
[239:28.89]Emptied in, but you slipped by them.
[239:32.17]It's what had to be me.
[239:33.55]I'm a master at looping the light.
[239:35.65]I tend to be missed.
[239:39.27]You think we're idiots?
[239:41.64]Is that it?
[239:42.26]Huh?
[239:44.06]Why?
[239:45.02]I'm on it.
[239:45.64]I'm nice.
[239:49.24]He certainly gives us an option.
[239:51.84]A strange one.
[239:53.29]But it's weather, these floods.
[239:55.07]What else can go on?
[240:01.23]If you want to watch the world sink beneath a rising sea, you watch all land things perish.
[240:06.35]And you're exactly where you need to be.
[240:07.81]What if you see sense?
[240:12.58]Arnon thuds a lump of soaked fabric on the table.
[240:17.14]Here's air.
[240:18.79]It's wet.
[240:19.69]I mean, it's a mop.
[240:21.03]Sorry, it'll dry all quickly.
[240:25.49]Follow the map.
[240:26.55]Come to Awari.
[240:28.01]There, learn for yourselves how you can deflect this drowning doom and these lands all safe.
[240:37.85]The shadows deepen.
[240:39.46]All monster groups will draw an extra monster card in every battle.
[240:43.16]I sound like a robot?
[240:44.08]I'm not supposed to sound like a robot?
[240:46.66]You sounded fine.
[240:49.06]What the fuck do we do about the dumb kids?
[240:52.32]I think we leave them behind, right?
[240:53.54]I think we get into a battle and then like... Kill them?
[240:57.59]Yeah.
[240:59.45]I mean, are we able to dump them?
[241:01.83]Oh, you can... Wait, wait.
[241:02.87]You can X them on that screen.
[241:04.21]Yeah, yeah.
[241:04.59]We can literally like X them out.
[241:07.85]And then just like go without them and leave them here.
[241:10.33]Yeah.
[241:10.72]Okay.
[241:13.28]But what about Dakin's quest?
[241:15.68]We can send them... Wait, we can send them to build things.
[241:18.36]That's a good idea.
[241:20.10]we as we go into a new quest we can just leave them to like build places I guess wait who's got a quest no no I don't think anybody know no we're good I'm 48 years old you guys are like you need to be like a grandfather that's young I don't think people live that long in these times man yeah in these fantasy times with crow people
[241:50.67]My healthcare just wasn't there.
[241:52.87]Get the heck out of my party, kids.
[241:55.31]Leave this to the adults.
[241:56.75]Somebody said... I found a book where we could go to a place without adults.
[242:02.87]Somebody in chat said if we don't have five people in the party, we're just going to lose.
[242:07.27]They're wrong.
[242:08.82]They're wrong.
[242:10.32]They're actually so off-based.
[242:12.40]What would you do along us if you found your heart racing at the thought of another?
[242:17.82]Someone you stood beside through danger and then...
[242:22.02]Stop that mumbling.
[242:23.44]There's a sound.
[242:23.80]Hushed voices and careful footfalls approach down the overgrown path.
[242:27.10]To Thomas's ears, even these muffled noises are perfectly loud.
[242:29.90]Oh dude, you got a scar and now your ears are like better.
[242:52.79]I did the lady, I'm not, I'm not.
[243:21.69]They're not fooled by this.
[243:22.89]We're prolonging the inevitable.
[243:25.71]Yes, Mistress.
[243:27.88]I offer myself.
[243:29.34]Introduce us.
[243:33.18]We can... We can hear you.
[243:35.46]Oh.
[243:38.16]Oh, dear.
[243:41.62]Oh, they're like normal... Man, are we going to have to abandon this guy, too?
[243:45.99]You think we're ruffians?
[243:50.20]This was the nerdy guy that you did, I think.
[243:52.08]Same guy.
[243:53.26]Oh, you look experienced.
[243:54.78]Whatever you are.
[243:55.69]Bandits?
[243:56.55]Rogues?
[243:57.77]Not hounding for captives, I hope.
[244:02.31]Well... Oh, move it, you fool.
[244:07.29]How are you so miserable at this?
[244:11.23]I'm so sorry, mistress.
[244:12.93]Here, take my arm.
[244:17.50]A pair of travelers clambers free of the Bracken.
[244:20.54]Their clothing, fine, but a tad filthy.
[244:24.32]Hello, strangers.
[244:25.68]I'm Matic, a servant and apprentice to this prestigious and lovely woman, who... Well, perhaps we shouldn't use your real name?
[244:35.27]She's the queen.
[244:38.97]That's Hunway.
[244:40.93]Immediately.
[244:45.21]Oh, he knows your name.
[244:49.83]And why wouldn't he?
[244:53.77]Unwritten dream charter.
[244:55.25]Poet and peerless singer.
[244:56.94]Impossible to turn away in here when she's plucking strings, spinning yarns, deploying her famous vows.
[245:05.30]Well, you don't seem like a threat.
[245:07.86]Come sit by the fire.
[245:09.60]You're not kind of bad business.
[245:12.23]Along us.
[245:12.61]The fire sounds grand.
[245:14.65]Mistress.
[245:15.35]Along us.
[245:15.81]That was...
[245:18.19]The small camp settles a little awkwardly.
[245:20.81]Introductions go with it.
[245:22.43]Shortly thereafter, Inan can't help himself.
[245:24.43]He bends Hunwit's ear.
[245:28.10]My fucking neck!
[245:30.08]All reality is indivisible from homophilogy.
[245:33.04]That's a quote from Miladyn, as I'm sure you know.
[245:36.40]You rarely cemented the truth of it for me, though.
[245:38.79]See?
[245:41.80]Ster, your character is always, like, right up in front with his eyes just open.
[245:46.36]Oh, Mistress, you don't need to say that.
[246:07.27]I do though, just that nothing lasts forever.
[246:10.45]Bad fever took my lofty registers from me.
[246:13.27]My volume performance is such a physical thing.
[246:16.09]Most forget that.
[246:17.37]I'm weak nowadays.
[246:18.63]I lean on him, my student, manic there.
[246:20.98]You are holding up a phone and like holding it like horizontal, like you're filming this and making sure that you're in frame because it's your video.
[246:30.60]Yeah, I want to be the extra that gets noticed.
[246:33.00]But this is your video.
[246:33.98]So like, of course, I have to be in frame, even if I have nothing to do with this.
[246:38.21]Mistress.
[246:39.87]Oh, I would love to show that gift to you again, but it's gone now.
[246:43.95]Only the memory remains.
[246:46.89]Why not try a small dog song?
[246:50.25]Even if it's quiet.
[246:51.25]Even if it's just a shadow of you.
[246:52.49]You're going to make me fucking sing.
[246:55.21]You're going to sing as both characters.
[246:56.53]You have to sing as both characters.
[247:00.05]Oh, we can see what the apprentice has learned and make Jemma sing.
[247:03.45]What?
[247:04.27]Yeah.
[247:08.16]oh alright okay that's not what alright a night visitor's song okay no mistress of course not so young madoc apprentice to hunwit the dream chanter removes his instrument from its case his features composed take on a startling dignity
[247:38.19]Let's hear it.
[247:39.93]Give us a me, me, me, me.
[247:47.77]He sings his plays with great skill.
[247:52.28]First, he performs a somber ballad.
[247:56.08]Next, a rousing and farcical tune to dour lips up.
[248:01.04]Smiles pool in the warm orange wash of the firelight and song.
[248:05.55]He plays well into the night until others begin to pitch in with stories or songs.
[248:10.25]The night before the fight at Yooka's Folly passes easily in good company.
[248:15.71]Uh oh.
[248:19.79]Yeah, let's see how much we need those stupid children.
[248:22.05]Those good for nothing useless children.
[248:23.44]Wait, I lost two health and I still have this much health.
[248:25.32]I lost permanent two health.
[248:26.70]Yeah.
[248:29.24]Kind of makes me fearful for what is... What's in here?
[248:32.18]Yeah.
[248:38.77]And... Monsters!
[248:42.64]Why didn't you enter?
[248:43.66]The rest of us can't move!
[248:44.66]I didn't mean to click.
[248:45.86]Oh, you both can.
[248:47.48]I've got you, hubby.
[248:49.26]Thanks.
[248:50.76]No!
[248:52.08]Wait, you can get the Lover's Vengeance, though.
[248:54.60]Alright.
[248:55.14]I'm going for a big spell.
[249:12.14]He's still... Oh, that was huge.
[249:20.10]See ya.
[249:20.50]Lover's vengeance.
[249:25.48]You have so much armor.
[249:26.74]That's actually crazy.
[249:28.77]What?
[249:28.95]I was trying to be sus.
[249:33.39]Damn, 12 damage.
[249:34.77]Oh, you have that super magic water spear.
[249:36.91]Yeah, I got the god spear, yeah.
[249:42.16]This guy just did 17 damage.
[249:44.00]Jeez.
[249:47.67]Nice work.
[249:48.05]Is this more?
[249:53.31]Not that way, they're in.
[249:54.15]Hmm.
[249:54.59]What about through this door on the left?
[249:56.87]Ow.
[249:57.08]Yeah, probably.
[249:58.50]Yeah, in it?
[250:01.74]Nothing in here.
[250:03.22]At least, I don't think so.
[250:04.14]Unless it's back in the back.
[250:06.34]Yeah, maybe out back.
[250:07.08]Oh my god, you guys can move so far.
[250:11.88]Oh, what is that?
[250:13.02]Oh.
[250:26.21]Once you get the Spear of Legend, then all I get is a full transformation of my entire body.
[250:32.21]It's not even my spear.
[250:33.33]I nearly died for it because you left us to rot.
[250:36.89]Weird that you keep bringing that up.
[250:38.64]I'm gonna- I mean, I'm permanently cr- Oh, shit.
[250:41.62]Okay, there was something in here.
[250:42.42]It's weird that you keep bringing that up.
[250:52.60]Ouch.
[250:53.30]It's been ten years, dude.
[250:54.96]Oh, okay.
[250:55.44]Alright, I- I don't wanna- I don't- Okay, ow.
[250:58.44]I don't- Alright, I don't need- Your loved one hid.
[251:00.35]That's why.
[251:00.87]He hid.
[251:01.57]I don't need another character defining scar.
[251:03.47]I'm hiding.
[251:04.67]You don't?
[251:05.39]I'm hiding.
[251:12.96]You don't?
[251:14.24]Are you sure?
[251:14.70]I need to let go of this.
[251:22.93]You need to wake up.
[251:28.21]Oh, thank god.
[251:28.69]Alright, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[251:29.85]Alright, alright, alright.
[251:39.58]Twelve damage.
[251:41.00]Is there more?
[251:42.94]Thank goodness.
[251:45.52]Yeah, good thing our kids weren't there.
[251:49.68]Our kids just died.
[251:52.78]+2 warding.
[251:56.36]That would take... Are you tank?
[251:59.85]Oh yeah, that'd be nice for me, I think.
[252:05.95]And a shield.
[252:07.07]Oh boy.
[252:07.61]Alright.
[252:10.51]Um, we could probably... I mean, do you want a shield?
[252:13.11]Give you some ammo?
[252:14.65]I mean, is the wand one hand?
[252:17.01]Yeah, it is.
[252:18.45]I'll take it, yeah.
[252:19.13]Oh, alright, yeah, sure.
[252:20.33]That probably helps.
[252:20.83]I'll put it on.
[252:26.88]The Gorgonoids are slain.
[252:29.02]Battles led by them down a boulderous roam where gray grass matches the cloud color.
[252:35.71]Someone doing dragon pictures.
[252:40.99]Hey, Thomas.
[252:42.59]Old Thomas the Magic Man.
[252:44.47]You barely hurt.
[252:47.00]Hmm?
[252:49.92]What's your favorite monster?
[252:52.48]Oh, uh, why?
[252:53.96]I guess the Mok Moro creature up all night crafting quartz out of moonbeams.
[253:01.12]You're really just gonna, like, you're really just gonna read the dialog.
[253:03.82]Like, you're just gonna read the script and not really envision the character at all.
[253:08.88]Show me how you would do it.
[253:10.56]Go ahead.
[253:11.48]What is actually your favorite monster?
[253:13.48]I just said it.
[253:18.30]You're lying.
[253:20.96]Is it?
[253:21.62]Yeah.
[253:24.82]Oh, it didn't go forward.
[253:27.40]It's got to be a classic.
[253:29.40]I like vampires, though.
[253:31.18]Like, actually.
[253:32.62]So you're as bad as him.
[253:34.45]You're a sheep.
[253:34.97]You're a sheep.
[253:35.39]Intelligent.
[253:36.21]Charming beyond all question.
[253:38.80]I like vampires.
[253:40.15]Those answers are fine, but some of us will always love a dragon.
[253:47.89]Dragons embody the essence of the monster.
[253:50.43]That thing beyond human capacity.
[253:52.73]Not just fierce, but impossibly cunning.
[253:55.37]Wise.
[253:56.31]Artful.
[253:57.33]Distinctly above the human apex.
[254:02.96]I can't wait till we're around a fire.
[254:05.14]The stories will soar.
[254:10.70]That shepardess you got with is a dragon.
[254:14.30]Wait, you think so?
[254:15.22]I'm calling it.
[254:15.68]Yeah, she's a dragon.
[254:17.68]And you're just trying to, like, lead us in.
[254:19.52]No, we don't want... Oh, it's not a story.
[254:23.48]He's just building a bridge.
[254:24.49]Okay, they're trying to sneak into our fucking party.
[254:26.49]Okay, hang on, hang on.
[254:27.83]I got a plan.
[254:28.65]We're going to do this, and then we're going to make them find us a magic item.
[254:37.97]Just send him on like a 10-year circle.
[254:40.25]Have him going around a circle 15 times.
[254:42.03]Just keep walking.
[254:43.07]Just make them keep walking forever.
[254:45.71]Yeah.
[254:46.13]Put him on a journey.
[254:46.97]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[254:47.88]They're moving and we're standing still not doing anything.
[254:49.88]No, we're building the bridge.
[254:50.56]Oh, we're building the bridge.
[254:51.46]Okay.
[254:51.60]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[255:04.65]Look at you.
[255:05.01]Whoa.
[255:07.71]I'm trying to fly.
[255:10.27]That's what it looks like.
[255:11.35]I'm going to jump.
[255:12.49]I'm going to jump.
[255:15.71]I'm going to jump.
[255:17.89]Are you going to do it?
[255:19.95]It's kind of high.
[255:20.65]I'm going to jump.
[255:25.76]Apologies.
[255:27.02]I've been up here gazing into space.
[255:29.36]The landforms are just beautiful.
[255:31.52]Arresting.
[255:33.80]There's plenty to be interested in up here, don't worry.
[255:36.22]No danger spotted.
[255:37.50]Are you trying to fly or what?
[255:39.56]Because I'll fucking throw you if you want to fly.
[255:42.74]I want to fly.
[255:43.92]Hey, you know, throw me.
[255:47.32]Yeah?
[255:48.47]Do it.
[255:50.91]I'd be surprised if you remember the conversation, but you probably remember the night.
[255:56.17]The night we... What was the name of that story spinner you admired?
[256:01.69]Oh, Unwit the Dreamcatcher.
[256:03.57]I'll always remember.
[256:04.45]Wasn't this like four days ago?
[256:06.53]Yeah, literally.
[256:07.91]You probably don't remember.
[256:09.39]You were blackout drunk.
[256:11.29]I'm a bit old nowadays.
[256:12.87]Right.
[256:14.77]Something that night keeps reentering my thoughts.
[256:18.33]That's when you posed the question.
[256:20.57]Well, remember what you asked me.
[256:25.50]Yeah, is your dick still a man's dick?
[256:30.15]given what you've gone through.
[256:31.81]No, not the other thing.
[256:33.91]Oh.
[256:35.27]What would you do with August if you found your heart racing at the thought of another?
[256:39.93]Someone you stood beside through danger.
[256:45.22]Oh, you didn't forget.
[256:48.60]What ended up happening with that?
[256:54.86]Uh, nothing.
[256:56.40]End scene.
[256:59.79]Sorry.
[257:00.89]No, no, it's, uh... I just mean... What?
[257:06.65]Go ahead.
[257:07.60]What did you want to say?
[257:08.40]I just want... You've been talking about me?
[257:15.60]What?
[257:17.32]Is this like a you talking shit moment?
[257:19.80]No, this is like he's trying to cheat on you with me.
[257:22.36]Grr.
[257:31.12]Sometimes you display an astounding aptitude for missing the subtext.
[257:36.54]You don't have to mock my voice.
[257:40.68]But along us, I was talking about you.
[257:44.00]Gasp.
[257:47.32]I hoped and I hoped.
[257:48.48]I thought my chest would explode.
[257:50.68]I didn't dare hope.
[257:52.02]What is happening?
[257:53.83]Forget Thomas.
[257:56.29]Let's fuck.
[257:58.29]It's the opposite of judicious.
[258:01.19]But will you try this with me?
[258:03.81]Oh, that's your line.
[258:05.52]I get it.
[258:07.26]Why didn't you tell me?
[258:09.00]What about Thomas?
[258:11.00]What the fuck?
[258:11.64]What about him?
[258:15.62]I'll have to tell him.
[258:17.58]Maybe he'll take it.
[258:18.48]Alright.
[258:19.25]I don't know.
[258:19.81]I just... He's gonna hate me.
[258:23.33]I tried to get him killed in that cave ten years ago.
[258:26.63]He's just too normal for both of us.
[258:28.45]Look at us.
[258:29.90]Not weird enough.
[258:30.80]I don't have enough... I don't have like weird arms.
[258:32.64]I don't have like a big... You'll never identify with me.
[258:36.62]He can't really connect.
[258:38.16]He's just too normal.
[258:40.50]I don't think there's anything else we can do.
[258:43.76]Now we both know.
[258:47.80]I'm going to the costume store and I'm just getting like a weird mask or something.
[258:51.00]And look guys, I've got like a weird mask.
[258:57.95]I didn't click it.
[258:58.85]Star clicked it.
[259:00.75]What's happening?
[259:01.45]Yeah, we all.
[259:04.65]Far we go and high we climb.
[259:06.35]The distances we walked led us here together.
[259:11.75]We have fallen in love.
[259:19.42]Thomas and Inanna are rivals.
[259:22.68]Slash duel.
[259:26.02]I don't think you want that smoke.
[259:28.16]I'm the penta of this group.
[259:30.32]Just fucking everything up.
[259:40.24]I'm not weird enough.
[259:42.24]Oh, no.
[259:42.82]The Gorgon's moving a great number of planes to attack the lands.
[259:45.00]That's so far away.
[259:46.92]They're coming kind of this way.
[259:48.39]They're kind of coming this way.
[259:50.19]I think we're good.
[259:52.95]How long did you guys want to go for?
[259:54.56]scary scary here yeah I I want to see how Thomas reacts to our affair yeah I want to see no why don't you guys go defend the land look he's a what he's like he's watching angry some guy's a basement over here yeah
[260:16.42]they've been late all day late rising late on the trail late to recognize sunset and late spotting this ruin it's the remains of a smallish structure and it rests on a cleared rocky slope where the trees find little purchase hmm and now what do you know about this area all I've heard is that it used to be more thickly settled guys you want to hear something crazy
[260:45.77]If Inan and Elongas have a child, then we would have three new characters, and then, like, they would all be, like, weirdly related.
[260:57.42]That's true.
[260:58.10]I didn't mean to walk in on you, step-sess.
[261:02.68]Someone was born here.
[261:04.14]Put your tail away.
[261:05.16]An ancestor of the pumpkin guy.
[261:06.76]You know the guy with the pumpkins?
[261:08.12]There's the Serpent Sable.
[261:15.02]We're the first down here in some time, huh?
[261:20.54]Someone worked at the stable.
[261:21.90]Knife lines.
[261:23.02]Stains of sediment.
[261:23.82]This isn't about our relationship.
[261:25.28]Ash on the floor?
[261:28.90]It's chalk.
[261:30.70]What are these ash marks?
[261:33.74]And what's in the box?
[261:34.88]Why don't you open it?
[261:36.62]Open it really close to your face.
[261:40.58]Something wrong?
[261:42.20]Why is my voice thing all a different color?
[261:43.94]Because you're reading the choke off the wall, I think.
[261:46.80]Oh.
[261:46.90]Wait, what?
[261:47.32]Wait, you were reading a poem.
[261:48.14]So, do you see anything that we could use?
[262:12.36]The box is puzzle locked.
[262:16.38]One of those magical puzzle locks.
[262:22.35]Oh, it's a magical puzzle box.
[262:24.87]Magical puzzle box.
[262:25.75]Okay.
[262:26.17]Interesting.
[262:26.79]So, like, I could probably do that.
[262:28.15]But you two could probably figure it out.
[262:29.29]Maybe you should.
[262:30.05]Maybe you should do it.
[262:30.95]It'd be useful for once.
[262:32.27]You two could figure it out.
[262:34.23]Yeah.
[262:35.93]So, but I don't know how we can open that unless... I think you two could probably get really cozy down here and figure it out, right?
[262:41.60]Well, I think you could probably help.
[262:43.99]I could.
[262:44.41]For once.
[262:46.09]Then why can't we all just get along together?
[262:49.51]Mm-hmm.
[262:52.49]Remind me how these function.
[262:54.97]Bargain generations were bonkers for these things.
[262:57.98]These puzzle locks.
[262:59.44]Yeah.
[263:01.20]I don't know.
[263:02.36]There's a problem that I could sniff, or perhaps if there was some way I could bury my feces near our camp, I could do that, but...
[263:11.90]The magic lock presents a prompt with a clear slate to write an answer.
[263:18.64]The wise wanderer finds home where?
[263:24.02]This is on you, Thomas.
[263:25.82]You're saying you can do this.
[263:27.68]Where does he find home?
[263:29.70]The wise wanderer finds home.
[263:31.53]Do I have an option or do I say it?
[263:33.89]I think it's going to give us multiple choices.
[263:35.37]No, don't make it easier.
[263:38.79]Wait, we want what's inside.
[263:42.09]I veto this.
[263:43.50]Next.
[263:48.24]I'm sure there's a systematic approach to this.
[263:54.24]Well, air is turning out better than I thought.
[263:57.26]Could cook dinner and make a night of it.
[263:59.37]Talk some guesses, maybe.
[264:03.19]I'm sorry, it's interesting.
[264:04.91]I'll grab the things.
[264:08.28]I'm just as invested.
[264:09.30]Yeah, I'll help.
[264:11.76]They hold their gear down the slippery stairs.
[264:14.02]Thomas investigates the blocked chimney pipe, goes above ground a while, and clears it from the end.
[264:18.66]Anon's absorbed in a book he digs up.
[264:21.16]It's full of creative geology.
[264:23.40]A longus rushes a rabbit stew and has to put it back on the fire after it does that.
[264:28.83]Why do we keep letting you cook?
[264:30.35]Why do we keep letting you cook?
[264:31.17]You're killing us.
[264:37.16]Wise wandering.
[264:37.82]Where?
[264:38.06]Okay, where?
[264:42.54]Where his books prove too many to all.
[264:45.24]What?
[264:46.37]Where shrewd folks still are scarce.
[264:48.79]I feel like Thomas is onto it.
[265:06.24]Alright!
[265:07.84]I might have interfused that time, sorry.
[265:13.48]Just then, a clatter of hunting bird calls echoes into the basement hollow.
[265:21.20]Oh, I was on the wrong page, sorry.
[265:22.56]It passed the time.
[265:38.18]Legacy points.
[265:38.80]Two.
[265:39.12]Uh-oh.
[265:41.66]Fight.
[265:42.34]We have to fight our way out.
[265:45.78]Yeah, we do.
[265:47.26]Squirrel.
[265:47.52]Is it only two?
[265:59.35]Or it was like five, right?
[266:02.57]I don't know.
[266:03.88]Hmm.
[266:08.65]I eat it.
[266:11.25]Legacy point.
[266:13.35]Legacy point!
[266:14.19]Brie brie!
[266:15.91]I put it in my mouth.
[266:23.50]Sir, could you please tell Jerma he looks crazy cute today?
[266:28.80]Tell him yourself!
[266:35.98]Jemma, you looking crazy cute right now?
[266:38.05]Hey, thanks.
[266:41.75]I did put a new product in my hair.
[266:43.33]Oh, is that like a new webcam?
[266:46.34]You sound a little different.
[266:49.60]Alright, I'm going to ignite.
[266:54.30]No, I'm not.
[266:57.90]Oh!
[266:59.42]You created fire with it, wasn't it?
[267:01.48]I actually did, and I think I just burnt you.
[267:02.88]And then Elongas put out the fire.
[267:08.40]wow I'm gonna read the book that we found oh god this is a really dark arc for Thomas yeah oh no somebody spawned over here it's alright I don't need anybody's help
[267:36.84]Then it gets smashed into the ground.
[267:44.74]There, I turned off the light.
[267:58.89]They're cheaters.
[268:03.95]I wonder if we're going to have a big blow-up.
[268:07.51]I'm really surprised.
[268:08.41]Ooh, a tier 2 staff.
[268:10.67]You could replace your tier 1 wand.
[268:12.65]Yeah.
[268:15.37]That is absolutely what I'm going to do.
[268:17.23]Yeah, maybe you should give it to your son.
[268:19.19]Yeah.
[268:20.17]I was going to rename it.
[268:22.61]Poison?
[268:23.75]Apply poison as an action.
[268:26.22]Offhand.
[268:26.98]Applies two poison to your weapons.
[268:30.25]Probably one of you guys, right?
[268:31.79]Just give it to one of the kids, I guess.
[268:33.65]My hands are full, so are yours.
[268:34.69]Yeah, Dakin can take it.
[268:37.13]Yeah, he's poisonous.
[268:45.85]Where are we going?
[268:46.47]We're going here, right?
[268:48.19]Yeah, is the goal?
[268:49.73]Where's the goal down this way?
[268:54.08]The Raging Gorgons.
[268:55.40]I don't know what we're going to do about that wall.
[269:00.37]Strength six.
[269:01.63]Mama mia.
[269:04.71]Wait, where are we?
[269:05.39]Oh, wait.
[269:06.27]What?
[269:06.47]Yeah, we have to go stop that.
[269:07.69]Is this going all the way around?
[269:09.05]Yeah, we have to.
[269:09.47]Oh, my goodness.
[269:09.93]It's the only way.
[269:11.55]A tile will flood in 90 days.
[269:15.35]Oh, goodness.
[269:16.35]Okay.
[269:17.29]They're flooding the world.
[269:18.19]We have to stop that march, though, for sure.
[269:22.27]Yeah, this is the thing that we have to get rid of completely, right?

[270:54.06]I thought the army was here.
[271:01.55]What's wrong?
[271:02.89]I sense magic.
[271:06.59]Gorgons.
[271:08.41]I said magic.
[271:11.81]It's this way.
[271:14.71]What is it?
[271:16.51]It's an overgrown mess.
[271:18.13]That's what it is.
[271:18.79]Help me uncover it.
[271:22.40]Ah, there we go.

[271:25.55]I don't even know what words I just said.
[271:27.77]What are you talking about?
[271:29.03]We just pulled some weeds.
[271:30.71]I don't feel anything.
[271:33.65]It's a font of spell thread.
[271:36.90]It feels like someone is pouring honeyed sunlight woven with strands of fire through my body.
[271:41.80]This feels so good.
[271:44.68]Honeyed sunlight.
[271:49.87]Oh, yes, sunlight and starshine.
[271:52.49]Well, at the same time, it's an unfurling to the world around you, to the spirit of a place or a thing.
[271:57.94]Wow.
[271:59.74]Objects.
[272:01.44]Spirits.
[272:03.74]Well, not like conscious ones.
[272:05.00]It's more that we're connected to everything.
[272:07.24]Spell thread woven between all of reality.
[272:11.65]Sometimes I feel like there's an entire world that I'm missing.
[272:18.05]That's how I feel when I talk- when you talk about tactics, ooh.
[272:22.65]What happens when you touch it?
[272:24.49]I kind of like that one.
[272:28.70]Well, I don't know.
[272:29.62]I've always sort of worked with the energies from afar.
[272:32.60]I guess I could put my hand on it.
[272:36.18]This far down.
[272:37.09]Look at that evil grin.
[272:39.15]But go back, go back.
[272:39.93]You- you- You know something.
[272:41.97]You want me to die from this.
[272:43.61]Oh yeah.
[272:45.04]Our rivalry is boiled over.
[272:47.91]It's now we're trying to kill each other every time.
[272:52.51]Wait, that's you.
[272:55.71]Oh shit!
[273:00.10]Are you okay?
[273:04.52]No!
[273:05.58]No, I want that character trait!
[273:09.60]No, that's not fair!
[273:12.55]You're like a blueberry!
[273:15.60]That was supposed to be my cool character trait.
[273:24.12]I feel connected.
[273:27.78]Yes, exactly.
[273:29.22]To everything around me.
[273:30.42]Look, you got your little pan flute on your waist.
[273:38.00]Wow.
[273:39.22]So useful.
[273:39.94]Is there even a me?
[273:42.62]You get the cosmic experience.
[273:49.36]Come on.
[273:50.64]We can chat about this on the road.
[273:52.11]I can't believe you got the awesome character trait cosmic experience.
[273:57.89]How do we... We need to go back and defend.
[273:59.45]How do we do this?
[274:00.05]It won't even... We need to go... Wait, do we need to go to... I don't understand.
[274:06.56]He stole your man.
[274:07.70]He also stole your cool trait.
[274:10.24]Oh my god, I did.
[274:11.94]That actually did happen.
[274:16.75]Alright, we have to defend the world.
[274:21.48]Enough petty bullshit.
[274:23.24]We have to defend the world.
[274:27.22]Look at how cool you guys look.
[274:31.26]I can't believe that happened, dude.
[274:32.74]I thought you were gonna touch it.
[274:34.54]Yeah.
[274:40.16]The Gorgons have come.
[274:41.32]How should we defend?
[274:46.64]Charging the battle.
[274:48.95]We're charging.
[274:49.69]Charging in?
[274:50.88]Yeah, nothing can fucking stop us.
[274:53.12]We have a blue guy.
[274:54.46]That's true.
[274:56.04]We do have a blue guy.
[274:57.20]No one's explained it.
[275:01.51]Oh boy.
[275:02.09]Alright, this is a big deal.
[275:04.45]Wait, where are they?
[275:06.99]Oh, they've got me over there, right?
[275:12.05]We're all split up.
[275:17.27]Oh, oh my goodness.
[275:18.77]OK, that thing's pretty scary.
[275:21.09]Look at that thing.
[275:26.73]Uh.
[275:28.91]Let's put people in cover, yeah?
[275:32.17]Good idea.
[275:39.65]What the hell is that for?
[275:40.57]That person is like raging.
[275:46.62]They're just pumping up.
[275:47.36]They're getting hyped up when the monsters actually show up.
[275:54.82]Oh, there is a lot of monsters down there.
[276:03.89]Oh, I have to fight the giant bear.
[276:06.85]I gotta get out of here.
[276:07.69]I gotta run.
[276:08.61]You're gonna get a cool scar.
[276:12.71]It may be character development.
[276:14.27]I don't know.
[276:14.79]Should I go with some character development?
[276:17.55]You have to go out.
[276:18.55]I'm going to jump in where you are.
[276:20.43]Oh yeah?
[276:22.49]Be gone.
[276:22.93]Did you send him away?
[276:23.75]Be back.
[276:28.25]Oh, wait.
[276:28.73]I thought that was me moving.
[276:29.93]Is there anything to shoot?
[276:32.87]There we go.
[276:36.57]You need to run, dude.
[276:38.25]I don't have any more action points, I don't think.
[276:41.27]Oh no.
[276:43.79]Okay, wait, wait.
[276:44.21]In that case...
[276:50.01]Yeah, this thing is going to kill me in one hit.
[276:52.14]No, I'm going to stand here.
[276:53.54]And then we're going to send out this lady to stand here and protect you.
[277:03.86]Good.
[277:05.84]I mean, heaven forbid I get a scar over the other eye.
[277:07.98]Nice.

[277:58.97]Uh-oh.

[278:04.69]Just watch someone die.
[278:05.93]You're supposed to be protecting.
[278:06.79]Thank God.
[278:18.48]I should be attacking those things that have hit my new husband.
[278:28.11]Hey, it didn't say you didn't get married.
[278:30.35]Yeah, it just said we're in love.
[278:33.37]We're eloping.
[278:34.27]We had an end of a chapter cutscene of us getting married.
[278:37.51]Don't forget you're still married.
[278:38.53]Ah, true.
[278:46.40]Well, you know what they say.

[279:16.19]I lost an eye, then got petrified on half my face, then turned blue.
[279:19.87]You got a wolf head, then a wolf arm, then raven legs and wings.
[279:25.31]And he has like a nice sash.
[279:28.29]Yeah.
[279:30.39]Excuse me, but I think I got the coolest outfit though.
[279:39.56]This guy is wearing like all gold.
[279:41.24]How did you block that?
[279:42.08]While also being a blue man.
[279:46.02]Oh, God.
[279:46.62]Okay.
[279:47.18]I'm too far away.
[279:55.43]Nice.
[280:19.35]So, are we controlling these people too, just randomly, right?
[280:22.67]Like, anybody can just do it?
[280:23.54]Yeah, I'm just controlling.
[280:24.76]Yeah, anyone can, yeah.
[280:30.12]I'm on Overwatch, so if either of those two things move towards you, I'll get them.
[280:34.50]Okay.
[280:40.75]Isn't your character better with fire, Jerma?
[280:42.81]Yeah, but where's the fire?
[280:44.15]I see one flame up here.
[280:48.09]I'm so glad you put him there.
[280:49.95]Yep.
[280:50.59]Oh, God.
[280:56.03]Well, just like our relationship, the fire seems to have burned out.
[281:07.75]Yeah.
[281:12.38]Yeah.
[281:12.98]Yep.
[281:31.12]Oh, that was a big hit.
[281:32.84]That was big.
[281:33.48]Are you staying there?
[281:34.24]Because you're going to die.
[281:38.79]This guy's here.
[281:40.11]This guy's here.
[281:45.85]I'm stuck.
[281:46.31]I can't move far enough.
[281:48.87]He should get targeted first.
[281:49.89]Denim should shoot.
[282:03.59]There we go.
[282:04.81]Oh, actually, that's kind of sad.
[282:05.91]Yeah, we're just using them to protect you.
[282:10.83]Yeah.
[282:11.26]Oh, my God.
[282:12.16]I really am.
[282:14.18]I really am like completely useless.
[282:16.62]We're just killing people to keep me alive.
[282:20.65]Yeah, it might not be enough, though.
[282:23.61]Oh, I'm good.
[282:27.26]See you later.
[282:27.64]I'm fine.
[282:34.22]I thought that was me moving a second time.
[282:43.01]Are you too far away to attack?
[282:45.23]Yeah, but I've got my sentinel was like if they move within two spaces I attack before they get their turn.
[282:50.40]Oh good.
[282:50.68]Good.
[282:50.78]Good.
[282:51.22]So I'm I will hit him regardless I've got oh regardless.
[282:59.50]Oh another person dead man.
[283:01.29]I've only got one eye guys.
[283:02.57]Come on No, oh You can take care of that guy I can take care of this guy here, yep
[283:24.28]Um... Um... Um... I think I'm... I think I'm really alright.
[283:32.93]Lobo, you might need to save... You might need to save Thomas.
[283:36.85]I mean, I could.
[283:38.92]You should save Thomas.
[283:40.20]Alright, he's still our companion even if the spark is gone.
[283:44.97]Hey, there's also a possibility that I get a really cool scar.
[283:49.74]I don't know about that, champ.
[283:51.38]I don't know.
[283:51.66]It's up to you.
[283:52.18]Are you going to save your actual relationship?
[283:56.90]Your actual husband?
[283:58.22]Which one of us do you save?
[284:00.16]I don't know.
[284:00.50]Anon's looking pretty threatened right now.
[284:02.86]I don't... Yeah, well, maybe.
[284:06.17]I don't think so, though.
[284:08.87]What's your decision?
[284:09.61]Are you going to let me... Let's see.
[284:10.87]Oh, okay.
[284:12.63]Okay.
[284:13.61]Let's see what happens, then.
[284:16.59]Why did you put that light out?
[284:23.09]Big damage.
[284:35.39]Blocked it.
[284:36.63]Still good.
[284:39.28]We can't be stopped.
[284:41.82]Actually, I'm just going to leave.
[284:45.83]And I'm gonna go like this.
[284:55.87]Uh... There it is.
[284:59.25]Got it.
[285:00.05]We're good.
[285:00.95]Yeah, I didn't need any help.
[285:10.03]Yeah, see, I got Lover's Vengeance down here.
[285:11.79]Because you shot at him last turn.
[285:13.54]I'm totally giving up on you.
[285:19.06]That's kind of harsh, man.
[285:21.14]Well, you know what?
[285:22.12]The bluer you are, the hotter you are.
[285:23.58]I took his blue thing.
[285:24.54]Imagine if he'd been blue.
[285:25.44]He would have finally been one of us.
[285:26.54]I know.
[285:26.70]It would have been so much more exciting, Gabe.
[285:28.62]I would have been screaming.
[285:29.72]I would have been jumping up and down in my room.
[285:31.66]So, what's the goal now?
[285:37.97]We have to clear Reda Threshery.
[285:41.37]It looks like Chapter 3, we have to meet Anon at Nook Balon.
[285:48.25]Where is that?
[285:52.35]Have we even found this place?
[285:56.44]Oh, it's right here.
[285:57.16]It's down here.
[285:57.76]Lower left.
[285:58.28]Okay.
[285:59.28]Let's just go there then, yeah?
[286:06.00]The tile just flooded.
[286:07.21]The one we needed to go through.
[286:09.07]What?
[286:10.69]Oh, come on.
[286:14.35]Useless children.
[286:16.53]Yeah, I thought that... Weren't they building dams and stuff over here?
[286:20.04]Let's give Dakin.
[286:22.69]He's the warrior, right?
[286:24.03]Yeah, he can take that.
[286:28.87]And then a pair of metal braces.
[286:30.99]Yo, that might make up for my terrible eyesight.
[286:34.09]True.
[286:39.06]Very true.
[286:41.76]So we can't go this way anymore, can we?
[286:43.86]Oh, we can.
[286:44.60]We're just traveling slower.
[286:53.96]Alright, so have we made it?
[286:57.02]We're nearly there.
[287:00.16]Need Arnon at the nook?
[287:03.79]Yeah, this is the nook.
[287:05.43]Oh shit, okay.
[287:05.87]We should patrol it.
[287:06.69]Let's patrol first.
[287:09.31]You keep getting rid of the kids.
[287:11.23]Who wants them?
[287:15.46]Wait, patrolling the wrong place?
[287:18.10]What?
[287:19.49]That's fine.
[287:20.15]You guys need to heal.
[287:20.93]You need time to heal.
[287:22.07]Thomas is on three health.
[287:23.17]Oh my goodness.
[287:23.79]I really am almost dead.
[287:30.51]Dakin receives a challenge from his past.
[287:33.53]He's fucking like seven.
[287:34.93]What do you mean?
[287:36.55]Boy.
[287:37.05]What?
[287:39.08]We actually, let's, we're skipping this, right?
[287:42.40]Our child's growth is irrelevant.
[287:47.22]Oh, it's literally the two children going on an adventure together.
[287:53.34]No.
[287:55.95]No.
[287:56.79]Kids can't go on adventures.
[287:58.91]My son is a buzzkill.
[288:01.75]He says don't go.
[288:04.61]Why can't one of the real adventurers get an opportunity?
[288:08.09]Right?
[288:11.49]Okay, we cleared it.
[288:14.06]No!
[288:14.74]Our sons!
[288:15.70]What are they doing?
[288:17.23]Didn't we tell them not to do this?
[288:21.47]We're going to see from a distance.
[288:22.63]They're going to be fighting this battle and that we're going to watch somebody die.
[288:27.54]Wait, do we bring them into the battle?
[288:29.14]Is this their like coming of age thing?
[288:30.62]I think they just did it.
[288:31.58]Yeah.
[288:31.90]Now's when we find out whether our gamble makes us fools.
[288:37.12]Guy by Arnon's map.
[288:38.31]We're nearly there.
[288:39.27]Are you good?
[288:42.01]Oh, I'm on the wrong page.
[288:44.07]I read the next one.
[288:45.91]As we find out, Gamma makes us fools.
[288:50.28]Although it's said that Takata Noose is the guy and a dangerous friend.
[288:54.36]Hmm.
[288:56.30]In my experience, I've never had the chance to test it.
[289:00.45]Dad, why are you blue?
[289:01.45]Magic, son.
[289:05.56]Yeah, why are you blue?
[289:07.10]You can explain it.
[289:11.57]Hold on.
[289:16.75]No.
[289:18.95]Dude, this is rough.
[289:21.13]Are we bringing the kids?
[289:22.93]That's it?
[289:23.37]Kids are in?
[289:24.44]Let's stay back while the kids try and prove themselves.
[289:28.42]I don't like that idea let's look the kids will if they die they die man you know that was really loud oh is it I'm sorry I went oh that was loud I don't think it came through your mic you guys didn't hear it no you said hold on and then there was silence oh
[290:04.87]I see.
[290:09.55]This is your son.
[290:12.28]This is your son.
[290:13.60]Control him well, Dacon.
[290:14.88]He belongs.
[290:21.18]Oh!
[290:21.78]You motherfucker!
[290:24.19]You trying to take me out?
[290:29.65]What do you think you're doing, Thomas?
[290:33.19]It was just a miscalculation, that's all.
[290:36.15]Is that so?
[290:37.63]Yeah, I pressed the wrong button on my staff.
[290:43.11]I pressed B instead of A. Sorry, when I hold B and I cast it, it went the wrong way.
[290:46.87]That's right, Lux is about to die.
[290:54.78]I'm killing them all.
[290:55.90]Uh-oh.
[291:01.25]Oh, you made a mistake grabbing me.
[291:07.15]Children protect me!
[291:21.88]I'm living free and wild.
[291:23.78]What should I infuse, Uncle Thomas?
[291:26.82]What you should do is... Infusion is very difficult.
[291:30.26]What you have to do is grab a hold of elemental fire, elemental water.
[291:35.25]I think you are probably going to be a water student, if I were to take a guess.
[291:39.67]Grab the water.
[291:40.29]There's a well over here.
[291:41.59]Craft it.
[291:42.19]Hold down A. Don't hold down B. I cast Ignite!

[292:42.92]Wow!
[292:43.18]Nice one, son!
[292:44.14]I'm not your son, I'm... I'm Inan's son!
[292:56.07]Oh, that's alright.
[292:57.51]I'm... Yakon, how you doing over there, son?
[293:00.47]Oh, doing good, dad.
[293:05.55]I think.
[293:08.15]Watch out for the bear.
[293:09.63]How come nobody is teaching our children?
[293:11.49]I'm the only one speaking to them.
[293:17.47]Hides behind rubble.
[293:24.91]Move fire.
[293:27.47]That- Watch where that- Ow, my- My back!
[293:31.13]Ducking, what are you doing?
[293:37.58]I'm guarding.
[293:38.10]I don't know, I just clicked a random button.
[293:41.30]Oh.
[293:41.90]Dodged it.
[293:46.18]Big swing.
[293:51.89]Oops.
[293:56.85]Nice.
[294:02.33]We did it.
[294:03.97]We have cleansed the world.
[294:09.15]A tiny little hand axe that you can throw.
[294:11.05]Hmm.
[294:16.45]We could salvage it.
[294:17.77]Yeah.
[294:22.21]Is it more?
[294:22.83]May not be done fighting.
[294:30.90]Anon emerges rather suddenly from a damp shadow standing before a root framed tunnel so you made it I was I was wondering I was wondering if you remembered you died we would the old deepest leads them into the dark
[294:55.05]I guess he's the deepest I'm sitting here wondering like what is that the Earth walls are slimy and black streams of water slosh either side of hastily heaped gravel path clods plop from the ceiling support beams have clearly been rushed into place don't take any awful tunnels they've been falling in my neck deeper in but he is the deeper
[295:25.31]a Warren rots the flowing water follows cavern channels away from the main tunnel to some dark end oh no
[295:47.30]We can't.
[295:48.52]Do you want breakfast?
[295:51.00]Oops.
[295:52.58]It's like he doesn't speak English and he's like trying to find the word.
[295:56.10]What the breakfast?
[295:57.89]It's mid-afternoon.
[296:04.91]Ah, but we're not chained to the sun cycle.
[296:07.65]We have breakfast whenever.
[296:09.15]Blew my mind.
[296:17.46]Dude, that's the expression that you see when you see that McDonald's breakfast is all day.
[296:22.31]Right?
[296:22.53]Like, there are some that do that, right?
[296:24.25]What?
[296:26.03]A weird smell beckons them through.
[296:29.25]To the other side.
[296:32.79]Here they are, dear.
[296:34.13]The badger and the root.
[296:35.90]And more to follow.
[296:39.96]Bleh.
[296:41.42]Where did you offer them, Gramm?
[296:45.57]Sheridan, no one wants lukewarm, chewy old ground.
[296:49.37]I keep saying.
[296:52.69]Well, like, how are we supposed to act in on?
[296:56.99]Uh, deep.
[297:04.22]Lying.
[297:05.28]Oh, I thought it was left to right.
[297:08.64]Oh, adventurers.
[297:10.44]This is some drunk I know.
[297:12.78]Yes, I'm a velda.
[297:16.44]I comes from Sweden it said I was born in the basin of dried caldera the spirits of salt and rock does get said a lot but not actually true right technically it's false you two are married to each other mostly married
[297:46.01]In times of strife, it's nice.
[297:48.21]I wonder about you.
[297:49.47]Which one of you are married?
[297:51.07]Anyone here married?
[297:53.47]Let's stay on course.
[297:55.63]Wait.
[297:56.07]Oh, let's stay on course, bro.
[297:57.49]The reason we're here, Nanon.
[297:59.02]Can they help us?
[298:02.12]The Brute speaks of reason language.
[298:04.32]You came here because you must defeat the Gorgons.
[298:06.74]Is that right?
[298:08.36]We were told you knew how.
[298:12.34]I know what the Gorgons did.
[298:14.58]Their leader, I learned of him, Ulthryx.
[298:21.66]These are the bad guys.
[298:23.04]Anand tucked into a bowl of beige mush.
[298:25.74]Looks like shroomy gruel with some kind of green gold dressing.
[298:29.14]Ulthryx!
[298:31.86]Like we know that name well enough.
[298:35.61]Yes, Ulthryx.
[298:38.17]Raised a great number of his brethren.
[298:42.12]and they went to the valley of god beast moatana that that picture looks so weird yeah dude what even is that uh try a little bit of force shortening next time and of that great gold beast they made Peter
[299:06.80]Melvin gazes on all intending from beneath the mess of it.
[299:17.62]This is the serious lore, come on!
[299:20.50]The scowl twists are already crooked features.
[299:23.14]Arnon finishes his meal, pulls out his beard, and wipes it on his cowl.
[299:28.06]Who?
[299:29.18]I said, Pete Ferry!
[299:32.04]Bo!
[299:33.52]Atona!
[299:35.64]Moatana is an ancient one, a keeper of balance.
[299:41.57]The unassailable balance of Moatana keeps all opposing forces of this world in harmony.
[299:48.09]Dude, I love how every time you do a dumb voice, they have so much dialog.
[299:52.69]Yeah, seriously.
[299:53.59]Because Moatana's dead, that froze off the water.
[299:59.04]And the seas and the peaks...
[300:03.84]I'll return to big blue gorgon soup that sounds tasty lord it'll dodge it oh the carrots and the beans I'll take it and the onions so that's why ostrich needed his army to slay a god well that's the point of what the spearway bled over he wasn't even born yet
[300:29.04]He wasn't.
[300:29.96]Wait, I'm realizing, okay, we had a 10-year gap, so these kids have to be less than 10 years old, right?
[300:37.73]They have to be, like, actually... They're, like, nine.
[300:41.37]With beards.
[300:42.47]It's, like, five and seven-year-olds.
[300:44.61]Yeah.
[300:51.19]What matters is this.
[300:52.79]Moatana cannot die.
[300:54.83]She's petrified.
[300:56.25]The reason I called upon you here is I've been hoarding a certain restorative spirit distilled from the roots of the extinct bullfax flower, I call it.
[301:04.46]Peter.
[301:05.70]Root beer.
[301:06.74]Root beer!
[301:07.88]Come on, bro.
[301:11.14]I love root beer.
[301:12.74]Pug.
[301:13.76]My root beer should be able to restore the great Moatana.
[301:17.29]If you can get it to her.
[301:19.42]I bring Godess Velda.
[301:25.42]Well, assuming that's true, why us?
[301:29.04]Don't you have your own lackeys?
[301:32.50]The Deep Dawn, some of it is.
[301:34.92]We're afraid our people are made frail.
[301:39.50]Water is the worst doom.
[301:44.02]The Gorgon leader is strong and fearless, so too are his orders.
[301:49.79]We are too old, slow.
[301:52.33]I'm scared to die.
[301:55.92]Likely story.
[301:57.10]The Gorgons aren't going to let us do this thing, are they?
[302:01.02]And do we know where to go?
[302:05.24]Well, are we sure if I own this god beast will fix everything?
[302:10.88]The badger grows quite asky, but I'll answer all of your questions.
[302:16.59]Oh god, please don't.
[302:18.41]Over breakfast!
[302:20.31]Over breakfast!
[302:21.59]I'm hungry.
[302:22.93]I don't like breakfast.
[302:26.96]Velda is true to her word and makes breakfast.
[302:30.12]The food is surprisingly good.
[302:31.62]What?
[302:33.98]I've only ever had mush onion soup.
[302:37.73]Lastly, Velda hands over her healing ale, a single sealed earthenware bottle.
[302:43.86]Soon they're on their way again.
[302:44.96]They carry the hope of all the land in this creature in one fragile bottle.
[302:52.68]Uh-oh.
[302:53.32]Okay.
[302:57.55]Uh-oh.
[302:58.73]Confront Ulstrix is our last thing.
[303:02.87]The real showdown.
[303:04.07]He's over there.
[303:06.41]This is what everything... Yeah, and we're taking the kids too.
[303:09.77]Don't leave the kids.
[303:10.63]The kids are coming.
[303:11.45]This is a long trip.
[303:12.95]We're easily going to heal up on the way.
[303:15.03]Dakon's trying to have like a moment again.
[303:16.83]No, he's not that one.
[303:19.79]This isn't his story.
[303:20.55]It's ours.
[303:21.61]He gets to tell the next one if he lives.
[303:25.22]I'm kind of worried that you guys are not going to be healed in time.
[303:27.34]Maybe we should back up.
[303:29.42]I think we're okay.
[303:30.70]I'm ready.
[303:31.78]Okay.
[303:33.58]Is this his thing?
[303:36.27]Oh, yeah, skip that.
[303:39.21]No one allowed to have interesting plots in our story.
[303:42.37]Yeah, especially not if their name is Thomas.
[303:44.26]No, not you, Thomas.
[303:47.28]Okay.
[303:48.94]This is it.
[303:49.92]This is the big one.
[303:53.98]We didn't even get... True.
[303:56.44]We're going to patrol this over here just to give you guys more time to heal because you're like half health.
[304:00.27]Yeah.
[304:15.90]All our lives we've been preparing for this eventuality.
[304:19.47]We're Gorwood Slayers.
[304:20.69]History brought us here because our people's history must continue.
[304:24.99]Be sure of your gear.
[304:26.43]This is our last sleep.
[304:31.05]I'm here for your love.
[304:33.74]Look at him in the background.
[304:34.88]Go back.
[304:37.80]He's lit.
[304:39.80]He's broken.
[304:41.87]Is my dad loving your dad now?
[304:48.05]You're like eight.
[304:49.13]You don't get it.
[304:53.71]They don't get gear like we do.
[304:56.60]I don't... I'm... I'm... Oh my god, all this drama.
[304:59.82]You still have one-star weapons.
[305:01.74]You have one-star weapons.
[305:02.88]You need to... You didn't grow at Wolf Farm, so you need to get something.
[305:06.66]You need to eat them.
[305:08.28]You should kill them.
[305:08.94]Betray them in the final battle.
[305:10.86]You need to, like, upgrade your rapier.
[305:12.60]Okay, hold on.
[305:13.90]I'm doing it.
[305:17.39]You're giving it a terrible name and description.
[305:19.57]So I spend everything, apparently, because this is the very end, right?
[305:22.97]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[305:23.43]We should.
[305:24.87]Well, is there something cool I can have?
[305:27.78]okay I got my sword yeah we could give you like a tier three uh like a wand or uh let's see yeah let me get this let me get this tier three uh wind twig yeah do it is it alright I'm gonna go for it okay and we'll we'll give the boy a tier two stuff
[305:59.18]I won't even give the boys a glance.
[306:02.47]Alright.
[306:03.35]I was writing the description on that and you came over and just took it from me.
[306:07.19]And was just like, yeah, you can do it.
[306:08.41]Did I just rug pull you hard?
[306:09.79]Yeah.
[306:13.57]Wait, I can go in the description and do it, right?
[306:15.49]Yeah, yeah, you can do it right now, I think.
[306:16.77]Yeah, okay.
[306:17.03]Actually, I think we have to wait to lay out of this menu.
[306:23.34]Okay.
[306:24.70]We're done?
[306:25.46]Yeah?
[306:25.58]Yeah.
[306:26.07]I was just etching that on the side of the staff in the corner, and you came over, grabbed it out of my hands, and just threw it into the side of the cave.
[306:32.66]I threw it on the ground.
[306:33.78]I'm sorry.
[306:35.34]Wait, can you do it right now?
[306:36.90]No.
[306:37.36]No, it's funny that way.
[306:38.74]Wait, click.
[306:39.54]If we click back, right, we can do it?
[306:41.73]Oh, no, it's way funnier that way.
[306:43.71]Oh, okay.
[306:44.25]What does it say on it?
[306:46.29]It just says lover's quar.
[306:48.11]I was writing quarrel.
[306:52.01]Oh, here we go.
[306:53.13]The two lovebirds.
[306:53.98]Let's see how this plays out.
[306:56.90]None.
[306:57.32]I don't keep odds in my head, but I think you and I have already beat them.
[307:02.27]Here together, whatever happens.
[307:06.55]The odds of our ever being here are beyond figuring.
[307:12.77]Today, history hinges on the deeds of a few very of one ordinary folk and a few unique folk who took a tortured road and wound up in the way of destiny.
[307:24.17]I'm glad it's us.
[307:25.51]Yeah.
[307:25.91]One normal guy that got like bumped his head once.
[307:29.19]And then we have all these superpowers.
[307:30.46]You are a wizard though.
[307:31.06]That's kind of not normal.
[307:32.28]That is true.
[307:35.09]My shitty son's a wizard for no reason.
[307:41.61]You know, what I like is a guarantee.
[307:43.53]What if this creature we're trying to restore is just... dead?
[307:48.53]Like you're so human.
[307:49.93]The name of our... Etched in his image are ours.
[307:56.57]A clear path climbs the hill ahead of them.
[307:58.49]Dude, whatever.
[307:59.95]Uh, wait.
[308:01.77]There it is.
[308:03.61]What the fuck happened to me?
[308:04.55]Dude, some shit.
[308:05.55]Some shit's gone down.
[308:07.17]This is it.
[308:07.89]This is the finale.
[308:09.65]Alright, let's get it.
[308:10.41]Let's go for it.
[308:11.27]Let's get it.
[308:13.59]Alright, no sudden... No one pushing up willy-nilly.
[308:18.10]I'm making sure I stay alive.
[308:25.98]Really?
[308:30.18]Oh, there's two of them there.
[308:31.68]I only saw one.
[308:38.85]Nice.
[308:42.11]It's me, Dad.
[308:45.43]It's me, Dad.
[308:48.28]Like, Dad, what should I do?
[308:50.16]It's me, Dad.
[308:52.98]That's the... Uh-oh.
[308:59.40]Is this the final boss guy right here?
[309:01.32]Yeah, I think so.
[309:01.82]No.
[309:02.38]Well, I don't know if it's him.
[309:03.92]I think he's a regular enemy.
[309:05.52]It should be Ulstrix.
[309:07.28]Oh, yeah.
[309:07.60]It is Ulstrix.
[309:10.25]Have you been paying attention?
[309:11.47]Dakin, no.
[309:13.22]Like that hurt, Dad.
[309:15.78]Dakin, no.
[309:16.56]Bad, Dakin.
[309:22.04]Alright.
[309:24.37]Disk.
[309:25.95]Throw the disk.
[309:29.27]Dude, I love just throwing the discs.
[309:40.89]That, like, hurts, man.
[309:42.31]I love that voice you're doing.
[309:57.06]Wow.
[309:58.44]Oh, my God.
[309:59.22]Alright, let's keep it going.
[310:06.66]I'm going in.
[310:07.74]I think we should.
[310:08.16]I mean, we kind of have to, right?
[310:10.18]Yeah.
[310:12.24]Oh.
[310:27.77]Very fitting.
[310:28.93]The red tiles are shaped like a heart.
[310:31.21]Nice.
[310:34.31]Very nice.
[310:36.25]Wait for me, Uncle Thomas!
[310:39.83]Why is Thomas following us all this way?
[310:41.61]No one likes him.
[310:44.73]Somebody painted this on the ground and I just, I don't appreciate it.
[310:49.34]Oh, that like hurt.
[310:52.24]Ow, my bones.
[311:07.45]Let him have it.
[311:11.71]10 damage.
[311:23.74]Hey kids.
[311:25.94]Time to activate order 666.
[311:32.91]666?
[311:33.13]I don't know that one, Dad.
[311:37.77]Like, I'm 7.
[311:38.73]I can't count that high, Uncle.
[311:41.50]Shit, Jesus.
[311:43.16]We won.
[311:43.70]Damn it.
[311:48.15]No, there's supposed to be the boss.
[311:49.75]Oh, wait.
[311:50.05]Oh, that's right.
[311:50.61]There is the big boss.
[311:51.25]Never mind.
[311:59.55]Right?
[312:00.33]I think so, yeah.
[312:00.87]It's right up here.
[312:05.73]Yep, it's this thing here.
[312:07.39]Oh.
[312:10.38]Send one of the kids to go touch it.
[312:14.38]This fucking shaggy looking kid hasn't even said a word.
[312:18.16]What do you mean?
[312:18.82]I keep talking to Uncle Thomas.
[312:21.93]We have been speaking this whole time.
[312:26.13]Along with us.
[312:27.15]There's the time.
[312:30.37]Bro, look at this thing.
[312:33.89]Were you really around all this time?
[312:40.80]Alungus unseals Velda's earthenware bottle.
[312:44.60]Just gonna pour it on the thing?
[312:46.50]Dicey a pour-o.
[312:50.86]He douses the petrified head of the god beast, Moatana, in the spicy, sweet-smelling elixir.
[312:57.94]We all look at it together.
[313:01.24]Nothing happens.
[313:03.12]Credits.
[313:05.22]This is not working, is it?
[313:08.87]Oof.
[313:10.87]We're out of time, Ostrich.
[313:13.89]Did they just give us a bottle of Sriracha?
[313:15.69]I don't understand.
[313:17.75]It didn't do anything?
[313:18.57]It was root beer.
[313:22.49]It was literally root beer.
[313:23.53]It was root beer.
[313:24.72]We did just pour a bottle of root beer on this.
[313:28.61]Why did we do that?
[313:30.15]The kid all the way on the right, no personality.
[313:32.35]I'm telling you.
[313:33.31]Shaggy needs to go.
[313:34.17]Just like his mother.
[313:35.31]Like, Ulstrix showed up.
[313:36.91]You know how long we've been fucking... Like, six hours, dude.
[313:40.29]Wait, Ulstrix?
[313:41.15]This is not Ulstrix?
[313:42.50]This is Ulstrix.
[313:43.54]Whatever is over here.
[313:44.74]I think... I think this is Thomas.
[313:49.48]Because you remember how he was reading the book at the start?
[313:52.62]Oh, okay.
[313:55.60]Ulstrix knew.
[313:56.68]This tale was of his telling.
[314:02.61]When the first land was raised from the folds of the sea, two worlds were born out of one.
[314:08.21]To Ulstrix, a mighty and arrogant Gorgon hero, this was creation's mistake, and he dreamed he'd mend it.
[314:17.03]Very little has ever been known of the things that scrum and scoil beneath the tides.
[314:21.51]We know the Gorgons are old, old, old, old.
[314:28.05]So maybe they aren't easily moved.
[314:31.87]My vanity hopes we threw him some surprises.
[314:36.18]But it's possible we were his fools from the very beginning.
[314:41.44]We unpuzzled the stone and chased that spear of petroglass.
[314:45.56]We struck a blow, I think, in taking it.
[314:48.85]But our grubbing plunder of a gorgon heirloom gave him a story to tell.
[314:54.35]Our species cast as the Scrabbling Villains.
[314:59.23]Incited, his Gorgon brethren together rose behind him to imputer this gentle god.
[315:08.06]And the ocean rose while the rain fell and the ice of the world turned to melt.
[315:14.86]For a while, I'm sure he believed his dream would replace reality.
[315:22.43]But it won't.
[315:23.19]This is you talking this whole time.
[315:24.29]Is the thing behind us unpetrified?
[315:27.07]Yeah, it is.
[315:27.45]Ah.
[315:30.46]Ulstrix.
[315:33.14]That's a lot of enemies.
[315:34.06]Oh shit, that is a lot.
[315:36.74]Kids!
[315:36.98]Go forward!
[315:37.22]Kill Ulstrix, animals will keep coming.
[315:40.62]Where is Ulstrix?
[315:42.14]Oh.
[315:42.84]I don't even know.
[315:43.79]All the way in the middle.
[315:47.33]Ulstrix is kind of hot.
[315:51.19]That's not the kids, that's you man.
[315:52.81]That was me.
[315:54.93]You tried to kill Aardvarr, and you accidentally said yourself.
[316:05.22]oops score that's a lot of enemies oh my dad told me that I can now
[316:29.72]Whatever this is, I'll live through it.
[316:31.92]You think he's one beast?
[316:34.28]He's dead.
[316:34.88]What are you doing?
[316:36.29]You've got yourself a Gorgon Stabber, and now he's got nothing left to lose.
[316:42.41]Why did you do that?
[316:45.21]His final act.
[316:46.35]He stabs the beast, but dies.
[316:49.89]What?
[316:51.14]Yeah, he's dead.
[316:52.08]He killed your son.
[316:54.18]Flame Eyes!
[317:00.66]I will remove all the joy from your life before this is over.
[317:06.12]Oh!
[317:07.70]Secret bite attack.
[317:09.32]He threw an enemy at you.
[317:11.90]You alright?
[317:18.68]Secret bite attack.
[317:22.08]Ugh!
[317:22.84]Ugh!
[317:30.59]I was supposed to be like crying and like screaming.
[317:32.01]He's screaming for his son.
[317:34.25]You're like throwing up.
[317:35.37]Oh, it's horrible.
[317:42.12]Oh, damn it.
[317:50.72]I can't reach.
[317:52.67]Oh, check this out.
[317:54.69]Flame eyes.
[317:57.35]Light up for my cousin.
[318:07.22]Oh Strixie, you piece of shit!
[318:11.66]My boy!
[318:13.32]Just like, fucking tears are just streaming.
[318:28.16]I'm going for Ulstrix.
[318:30.12]Spin around and cover me!
[318:43.57]Big hit.
[318:45.95]And again.
[318:53.62]Fire!
[318:55.12]Wait, wait, wait, how did I...
[319:01.47]You're just doing it.
[319:02.51]He's just doing it so wrong.
[319:04.31]Oops.
[319:06.21]You sabotaged him.
[319:14.21]Even more.
[319:14.75]Oh, he's ignoring me.
[319:17.70]Oh, no, he's not.
[319:18.36]Oh, that was eight.
[319:19.52]Seven damage.
[319:20.36]Holy shit.
[319:20.90]The fire actually worked out to be in a good spot.
[319:24.62]Uh-oh.
[319:25.34]Father, it hurts.
[319:27.34]Hard bar is not doing well.
[319:34.62]Uh-oh.
[319:36.32]Oddba.
[319:36.88]Oddba's not doing that well.
[319:40.30]I, uh... What's wrong?
[319:58.83]I don't want to leave my rock.
[320:05.48]Oh, shit.
[320:07.43]No, you still have armor.
[320:08.13]You're good.
[320:11.97]Oh, shit.
[320:15.05]I need fire.
[320:16.91]Got it.
[320:17.27]Come on.
[320:18.15]Come on.
[320:20.49]Just like your dad.
[320:45.14]I'm really annoyed that he lived we did it the mighty ulstrix finally crumpled before us his reeking corpse Twitch twitch.tv still it was over a little plug there some would say we saved the world
[321:08.20]we did save the ember of it we cupped this red coal of life in our sweaty palms carried it to the next morning through wreckage loss destruction it would take time for the water to go down the memories to lose their bite to rebuild to heal
[321:28.32]And maybe to live new lives.
[321:30.78]Someday.
[321:31.46]It shows us without you.
[321:33.65]Just us.
[321:34.63]Just new lives.
[321:36.89]Yeah, just these two.
[321:38.67]Nobody else in the story matters.
[321:40.67]Hang on.
[321:42.09]Didn't you write this story in the book so you writ your own downfall?
[321:45.25]No, it had blank pages.
[321:46.99]Wait.
[321:47.23]Yeah, I did write this.
[321:48.55]Thomas the Star wrote this exact story in the book and made it real.
[321:52.63]So he wrote that his husband would leave him and his son would die.
[321:57.05]No, the implication was that the end of the pages were blank.
[322:00.83]No, he filled them in.
[322:02.07]That was his whole thing.
[322:02.95]He wrote them.
[322:03.53]I wrote the story.
[322:05.13]Thomas made himself normal.
[322:07.57]he made he made his son die he made his husband leave him what the fuck the end that's yeah I finished the book the game has crashed the end you've won okay the end oh there's an after story hold on a minute
[322:32.21]Thomas developed a passion for restoring ruined sites.
[322:36.16]He rented out the finished sites to travelers at a decent nightly rate.
[322:39.46]So I just became like a landlord or like a hotel owner?
[322:42.04]You just became a regular landlord.
[322:45.06]And then it shows your memory of us singing together.
[322:48.95]Oh, God.
[322:50.71]Oh, no.
[322:52.87]That's awful.
[322:53.79]He doesn't even use magic anymore.
[322:55.59]Yeah.
[322:56.73]Oh, that's...
[322:58.82]Well, am I making money?
[323:01.30]The thing is, I had, like, plus 40 to Loner, so I don't even know how this happened.
[323:09.38]Turned into Landlord Andy.
[323:12.06]Odd Boss dreamed of his own personal research tower had finally been fulfilled.
[323:15.43]He kept it well-stocked with flammable powders and a couple of summoning circles.
[323:18.91]Wait, one of the kids died.
[323:20.19]Did we hear about that?
[323:21.15]Yeah, your kid died.
[323:22.39]Mine lived.
[323:23.19]Oh.
[323:23.31]I tried to kill mine, but...
[323:26.80]Dude, I was talking to your kid the whole time as if it was my kid.
[323:30.58]I know, he kept calling you uncle and you wouldn't catch on.
[323:32.84]Inan and Elongas could never fully abandon their adventuring life.
[323:38.16]While the danger had dimmed, there were memories yet to be made.
[323:41.76]Alright, I do now grasp your reasoning in bringing me here.
[323:45.99]There's my brilliant boy.
[323:47.27]I hope you don't mind bringing me Elnish wine.
[323:51.95]Remember, Thomas?
[323:53.91]Yep.
[323:57.71]Whatever happened to him?
[323:59.53]I'm sure he's onto something exciting and challenging.
[324:02.79]He owns a hotel chain now.
[324:04.27]There's 6,000 branches across the country.
[324:06.81]He owns some B&Bs.
[324:10.57]Alungus gathered as many of the company's stories as he could and enlisted Ardbar to illustrate them.
[324:15.89]Dude, your kid is working.
[324:18.35]I guess they did have that many tentacles, didn't they?
[324:22.37]What about, you don't want to ask me about anything?
[324:24.83]About our adventure that we had?
[324:26.11]We don't even know where you are, dude.
[324:27.69]You're just like a fucking Airbnb owner.
[324:30.91]By the way, whose memory is that?
[324:31.89]Because I look pissed.
[324:34.35]Hey, remember when we climbed this rock and there was nothing on it?
[324:37.13]Why am I in this room?
[324:38.25]We just cheated on your husband on top of the rock.
[324:41.15]Also, actually, I think this is the rock we climbed that turned my face into the wolf, but also my face is already a wolf.
[324:48.66]Oh yeah, that one is.
[324:52.15]Yeah, that's what we had.
[324:53.21]Oh, weirdly enough, you had both of your lover's Sparks on a cliffside.
[324:58.09]So that's just something that, okay, cool.
[324:59.95]Yeah, we had a big rock there and then you expressed your love to me.
[325:04.24]And then another big rock shows up and you express your love to somebody else.
[325:07.26]What the fuck is going on here?
[325:08.16]Are you saying I'm faking it?
[325:10.32]We're saying that if there's a rock involved, you're likely to make bad choices.
[325:14.00]I'm just saying a large cliff face apparently makes you want to be lovers with the person you're with.
[325:19.81]Alright, so we can choose.
[325:22.37]Oddbar does not get Eldecan.
[325:24.21]They do not get added to our legacies.
[325:25.73]But the other three, they live on.
[325:30.68]Choose one hero to promote.
[325:33.22]Select a hero and move on to the next legacy tier and their new items, history, and abilities will go with them.
[325:38.00]The higher a hero's legacy tier, the more abilities the hero will come into game with.
[325:41.35]Do people just die?
[325:42.99]I think Thomas deserves it.
[325:45.85]Look, Thomas becomes a local legend if we promote him.
[325:50.96]Not just a folk hero.
[325:54.10]We remain folk heroes because we disappear into the folk legend, but you actually stay around and give people great rates on a rune.
[326:00.49]Okay.
[326:01.69]That sounds good to me.
[326:02.53]Elemental weapons have been unlocked.
[326:05.57]I think this is all separate.
[326:07.62]Oh, it is separate.
[326:10.04]I chose to promote Thomas.
[326:11.20]This character will never be used again.
[326:12.48]He's dead to me.
[326:13.42]The adventure is over.
[326:14.64]Yeah.
[326:15.88]He's like 68.
[326:18.32]Oh, I see.
[326:20.60]I'll promote him in my game.
[326:22.26]Yeah.
[326:24.00]Cool.
[326:24.14]Alright.
[326:25.12]That's it, man.
[326:28.43]Well, that was really cool.
[326:29.65]That was the first campaign in Wildermyth.
[326:32.81]How many are there?
[326:34.89]Um...
[326:37.00]There is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[326:41.26]10 regular chapters.
[326:43.61]And then there's a special multiplayer one that is five player.
[326:47.51]Wait, hold on.
[326:48.01]So that was just one campaign.
[326:50.03]One of 11 campaigns.
[326:52.64]oh shit okay that's not including like uh I think there's there's also like you can mod the game there's like modded campaigns and stuff I've seen that there's mods that add like more different types of the conversation there's a ton of mods that add like new storylines and like things that can happen to you and all kinds of stuff but that was really fun yeah it's fun right it's cool it's just like an enjoyable like fun experience you just kind of mess around that's fun yeah
[327:19.16]And if we played again, it would be completely different.
[327:22.53]Everything would be different.
[327:24.37]Which is interesting.
[327:26.57]Well, that was a blast.
[327:28.39]Thanks for inviting me.
[327:30.25]Yeah.
[327:31.09]Thanks for putting it together, sir.
[327:32.58]Banger.
[327:35.10]So who's playing Darktide tomorrow?
[327:38.46]Hell yeah.
[327:40.42]Of course.
[327:41.58]I'm going to be sponsored to play it.
[327:43.72]Anybody wants to play?
[327:45.47]Dude, if you need a guy, let me know.
[327:47.35]I'll be playing.
[327:49.13]Yeah, well, okay.
[327:51.13]Because I think there's like a big pool of people.
[327:54.11]I have to get to one now.
[327:56.03]Cool.
[327:57.53]Wait, what's yours?
[327:58.59]What's the sponsor?
[327:59.89]Oh, I have to play WoW.
[328:01.89]Oh, okay.
[328:05.51]Yeah.
[328:05.93]The excitement drain from your body.
[328:08.59]Oh, wow.
[328:11.45]That was a- that was like a little, uh that was a little like-
[328:15.00]You could have at least faked it man it would have meant a lot to me if you just could have faked it but-
[328:17.00]Yeah that was like an: Oh! Whoa! Wow! Oh, okay, cool!
[328:21.00]You're like- you're like: Oh, okay...
[328:26.00]That's actually cool though, like- it's cool.
[328:29.00]Yeah I appreciate the invite though Ster.
[328:31.00]Yeah well, we'll catch up tomorrow because I think me and Strippin are probably gonna play Darktide like most of tomorrow.
[328:36.00]Yeah we'll play- we'll play-
[328:40.00]Yeah we should definitely play.
[328:41.00]Yeah.
[328:42.06]Okay, I'll see you then.
[328:42.80]Thank you, Stu.
[328:43.36]See you guys tomorrow.
[328:44.24]It was a pleasure, Gemma.
[328:45.66]No, it was great too.
[328:46.58]I know we've played Darktide, but let's go.
[328:50.71]Yeah.
[328:51.31]Alright, man.
[328:52.21]Cool.
[328:52.53]See you guys tomorrow.
[328:53.23]See you later.
[328:56.57]Bye.
[328:56.73]Yeah, more Darktide.
[328:57.79]I can't even talk.
[328:59.05]More Darktide tomorrow.
[329:01.59]It's going to be sponsored, but that... I wonder.
[329:06.81]Yeah, we'll probably just play Darktide tomorrow.
[329:10.62]Darktide is the new Warhammer 40k co-op survival game.
[329:16.30]It's fun.
[329:19.37]Be able to connect.
[329:20.09]Time out.
[329:20.75]Oh, because the session ended.
[329:22.37]Yeah, that was a lot of fun.
[329:23.17]I actually didn't know what to expect going into this.
[329:25.69]It was sort of a... Ster was just like, hey, do you want to play this procedurally generated kind of RPG D&D game that just makes random stuff happen?
[329:34.82]And it's like, sure, why not?
[329:36.70]Hope it was fun to watch.
[329:39.40]It was fun to do.
[329:43.55]You were lost the entire time.
[329:44.99]Yeah.
[329:45.73]I think that's part of it, though.
[329:46.53]It was definitely funny.
[329:49.77]But I hope you enjoyed it.
[329:52.78]Yeah, so tomorrow we're doing a Warhammer Darktide.
[329:57.48]And then the day after that, Austin Show and I, I'm going to be on Austin's stream, going to be in a big... We're going to be doing a flight simulator.
[330:09.99]I have no idea what to expect.
[330:12.75]I am...
[330:15.04]I want to say hopefully prepared.
[330:18.54]It's going to be a pretty wild experience.
[330:21.86]If you don't, obviously go follow Austin's channel.
[330:24.64]It'll be on Austin's show's channel.
[330:27.83]Looking forward to it.
[330:28.45]Should be fun.
[330:34.91]Bring sorcery back.
[330:36.57]Yeah, I know.
[330:37.39]And I told you this before, but I do like these
[330:43.19]I mean, I wouldn't call this a chill stream.
[330:45.93]But it kind of was.
[330:50.44]We're going to do way more chill streams.
[330:52.74]Where we just kind of play something and just hang out.
[330:54.02]Breath of the Wild?
[330:58.26]Yeah.
[331:00.83]This was more chill than Miku Picross.
[331:03.95]I think there was a... I would say this was a little high energy at some points.
[331:07.41]But it was just kind of playing.
[331:08.73]It was fun.
[331:10.29]But that's it.
[331:10.89]I will see you guys later.
[331:13.77]Have a good rest of your night.
[331:15.15]That's a perfect place to call it here.
[331:20.44]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[331:24.66]That was Wilder Myth.
[331:34.25]Have a fantastic rest of your night.
[331:36.09]See you tomorrow.
[331:40.41]Thanks for supporting the stream, always.
[331:48.59]No Otto?
[331:49.57]That's okay.
[331:54.01]You'll see Otto soon.
[332:00.46]But yeah.
[332:01.48]Darktide tomorrow, probably starting around... What time?
[332:05.26]That's a good question.
[332:06.34]Not as early as this started, but not super late.
[332:14.42]When?
[332:15.12]Let me see.
[332:15.82]When should it be?
[332:20.88]I want to play a little bit later in the evening, maybe.
[332:27.18]Maybe start around... I don't know.
[332:29.99]Just keep an eye on Sus.
[332:30.79]I don't want to start too late.
[332:32.25]Maybe like 2?
[332:34.61]Maybe 2?
[332:35.37]3?
[332:35.69]Let's just say 3.
[332:39.49]And I'm going to try to make it for 2.
[332:42.14]I also don't want
[332:44.58]have it be too late because I want to miss the um 7 30 internet crash that usually happens so that sounds like a good time to start two or three o'clock pacific obviously yeah take care of yourselves thanks for watching thanks to uh you know thanks to the boys that's fun we'll see them tomorrow
[333:16.16]Take care of yourselves.
[333:17.86]Good night.
[333:18.58]Goodbye.
