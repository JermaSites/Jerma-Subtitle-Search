[00:01.33]It did get updated, so let's find out.
[00:05.44]I am like four and a half drinks deep.
[00:08.14]I don't think it's going to go well, but we'll find out.
[00:16.25]Hey, maybe it'll be better.
[00:20.19]I thought it was 16.
[00:22.58]It was a joke.
[00:24.86]I was kidding around.
[00:33.22]That's loud.
[00:34.43]Turn that down.
[00:37.65]Alright.
[00:38.51]One singular run.
[00:39.44]That's it.
[01:02.59]One singular run.
[01:09.23]Is that Poke?
[01:10.39]Poke is higher than my- Wait, I gotta get it.
[01:12.18]I gotta get it.
[01:12.72]Okay.
[01:12.84]I gotta get this.
[01:14.08]I gotta get this.
[01:35.34]That could have been better.
[01:36.14]It's been a while.
[01:55.79]I haven't played in like a at least like four or five days.
[02:20.21]Oh, so this is what he looks like.
[02:21.61]Shut up.
[02:43.72]Oh shit!
[02:44.60]Ster told me to hold on to those.
[02:45.82]Okay.
[02:58.10]Outside, outside.
[03:00.12]Hey, there's a new butt chug in the vendor?
[03:02.30]Oh, thanks, dude.
[03:03.99]Let's make this a meme on the channel forever.
[03:07.59]Can't wait to read that.
[03:09.23]You know, next stream in a few days.
[03:13.32]Hey, Jerma.
[03:14.22]Hey, butt chug.
[03:15.41]Oh, okay.
[03:16.21]Why are you saying that?
[03:16.95]Oh, because you said it.
[03:20.65]Okay.
[03:21.31]You're going to follow everything I say?
[03:24.10]You shouldn't.
[03:27.83]Temperature fluctuations detected in air exchange systems.
[03:33.02]Expect intermittent drops in ambient heat levels.
[03:41.93]What am I doing?
[03:43.53]What are you doing, please?
[03:45.76]What are you doing?
[03:50.00]What about we gonna get a butt chug Grotto Beasts card?
[03:55.94]It's not an expansion to Grotto Beasts.
[03:58.55]It's one card.
[03:59.79]That's it.
[04:13.17]No more food?
[04:14.65]How?
[04:24.36]What did Holly say?
[04:37.61]Oh, how did I miss it?
[04:39.11]Are you kidding me?
[04:40.09]I missed the golden cookie bug.
[04:43.40]Those are worth so much, one.
[05:03.67]What on Earth has happened?
[05:10.01]What is happening in my life right now?
[05:20.12]This one doesn't count.
[05:37.48]Okay, back on track.
[05:38.06]Let's go.
[05:49.53]Dude, hey.
[06:00.77]So there was an update.
[06:01.63]I think they added a new act.
[06:04.19]Which I will never see.
[06:05.23]I gotta beat Act 3 first dude.
[06:08.72]Dude, what do you mean dude?
[06:10.46]Who are you talking to?
[06:11.54]Oops.
[06:38.18]I fell.
[07:06.24]Hey, you fell off.
[07:09.96]That's fine.
[07:13.54]Holly said I would draw it.
[07:14.66]I don't care.
[07:15.12]OK, later.
[07:20.06]Oops.
[07:27.67]Don't read the other chat.
[07:30.31]What does he have the chat say?
[07:31.13]Let's see it's over here.
[07:34.66]Hey bro, it's my birthday tomorrow.
[07:35.88]Could you sing happy birthday to me?
[07:37.76]Yeah dude, what's your name?
[07:40.92]I gotta wait for the bot too.
[07:45.79]Danny.
[07:48.37]Yeah, sure Danny.
[07:50.10]Happy birthday to Danny.
[07:53.42]Happy birthday to Danny.
[07:56.03]Thanks Danny.
[07:57.55]How old are you Danny?
[07:58.15]26!
[08:05.86]Damn, 27.
[08:08.78]Why would I correct that if it was just written down, Danny?
[08:13.59]I don't know.
[08:15.13]27.
[08:16.07]Holy smokes.
[08:20.92]Oh, wait.
[08:21.48]Hold on.
[08:21.92]I got another birthday.
[08:24.70]Birthday for Chris.
[08:28.69]Chris is 36.
[08:30.89]Can we get a happy birthday for Chris too over here?
[08:35.72]Okay.
[08:51.00]Thank you.
[08:52.24]Yeah.
[08:52.36]Happy birthday, Chris.
[08:53.31]Any birthdays over here in the other chat?
[09:04.06]Let's get them all.
[09:18.67]Me?
[09:19.59]Happy birthday.
[09:20.39]Um...
[09:22.64]Jason.
[09:25.97]Hey, check your chat by fax.
[09:31.81]Let me check the other chat.
[09:34.43]Hey, dude, you're really good at the game.
[09:36.68]I got this game because of you.
[09:39.52]I thought I was better than you at the game, but I realized that I am having trouble in the tutorial.
[09:45.28]So don't listen to the haters when they say that you're not very good at the game.
[09:50.23]Thanks a lot, dude.
[09:51.01]Appreciate it.
[10:05.81]It's the affirmation chat.
[10:06.85]Yeah.
[10:10.08]I didn't say it wasn't the affirmation chat.
[10:13.85]Alright, I'm walking in.
[10:14.59]Let's go.
[10:15.17]Training Chamber 22 climbing apparatus has been decommissioned.
[10:20.76]Use of equipment is strictly prohibited.
[10:54.97]Actually, I want to keep one of these.
[10:57.13]You fucking dumbass.
[11:05.00]Hey, dude, don't be so hard on yourself.
[11:07.13]Sometimes you make mistakes when you misclick.
[11:09.13]I've done it many times before when I played.
[11:11.45]By the way, I've only got to act one.
[11:13.64]Don't feel bad.
[11:14.70]Thanks, dude.
[11:16.86]Appreciate it.
[11:57.27]This is new.
[11:58.63]What's going on here?
[12:01.15]This is weird.
[12:01.51]What's going on here?
[12:04.26]Oh, fuck.
[12:05.52]Oh, God.
[12:07.16]Oh, God.
[12:07.68]Oh, God.
[12:08.28]Oh, God.
[12:12.63]Okay.
[12:13.45]This is a variant of the first level, I think, right?
[13:10.02]Shit, can I not make that?
[13:12.30]Shit.
[13:18.73]Lighting in corridor B12 remains at 64% functionality.
[13:26.36]Please report any outages.
[14:10.50]My hands!
[14:17.48]Fuck.
[14:19.06]What's the best way to go about doing this?
[14:21.99]I don't know.
[14:22.53]I'm just gonna say fuck it.
[14:23.27]I don't know.
[14:40.18]Hey!
[14:42.10]Act 1.
[14:44.57]I still got it.
[14:46.65]First try.
[14:48.01]Looks good.
[14:49.91]The update is not for the campaign.
[14:51.51]Yeah, I know, but I still want to try.
[15:05.15]Okay, so I gotta go back up there as well.
[15:09.33]Ster strap.
[15:17.78]I can't even reach that now.
[15:23.11]Oh shit.
[15:30.14]I'm good, I got it.
[15:34.50]OK, I've got two grubs now.
[15:36.81]What does that even do for me?
[15:37.95]If I eat a grub, I can crawl on walls for like 5 to 10 seconds.
[15:46.04]I need to make sure I have at least two spears for Act 2.
[15:51.23]It's very important.
[16:00.30]Only three?
[16:01.95]What are you talking about, man?
[16:04.33]Okay.
[16:07.75]That's good.
[16:11.60]That's good too.
[16:14.00]Uh, probably the second one.
[16:18.92]First one, maybe I don't know.
[16:27.43]Stamina is more important.
[16:32.11]What brand is that lava lamp?
[16:33.86]That's a good question.
[16:34.56]I actually don't know.
[16:37.32]Alright, well, this is the one solid attempt I'm going to do with this.
[16:41.75]And I need to save it as well.
[16:50.27]Uh, I have an ad break coming up here.
[16:52.51]17 minutes.
[16:55.40]Let's see if I can do this in 17 minutes.
[17:00.51]Let me get to the end of Act 2 in 17 minutes.
[17:02.13]Let's go.
[17:08.14]I need two spears.
[17:13.22]Emergency evacuation route through drainage system.
[17:21.07]Bad start.
[17:26.98]Sucks that I have to use this, but I do.
[17:53.86]Shit, come on man.
[17:55.16]That was, come on, get it together.
[17:57.92]Get it together.
[18:00.67]I am just blowing this whole run right now.
[18:21.10]Okay.
[18:35.81]I gotta go way faster than this, but I will take the food.
[19:05.03]Get outta here.
[19:23.36]Where's that go?
[21:01.57]I got Harry, but we're good.
[22:09.14]Oh yeah!
[22:10.95]Don't do that to me when I'm in my best ascent!
[22:48.95]Alright, one more, I think.
[22:51.67]This is new.
[23:17.08]No, Brian!
[24:15.82]Dude, why is that fucking P... I feel like I've died there once before as well.
[24:20.31]Where it just drops straight down.
[24:21.43]Fucking delete that shit.
[24:29.82]It was going so well, and then I fell down once, and then I... Dude, I...
[24:34.45]I've seen that area, you know what's crazy?
[24:36.93]I've seen that area one time, that's a variation of Act 2.
[24:40.40]I've seen it once before.
[24:42.14]And I died at the other time I was there.
[24:45.25]Because that, when you get through it, it just drops off into death.
[24:53.24]What is that fucking, what is that shit, okay?
[24:55.76]That's shit.
[24:59.43]What is that shit?
[25:01.39]That's shit.
[25:06.94]I've only seen that place twice and I've died twice.
[25:19.35]Yeah, that's shit.
[25:38.24]Same exact place I died.
[25:39.58]Same exact place.
[25:42.74]What is this butt chug bullshit?
[25:52.75]That was, I was going, that was going so well too.
[25:54.82]Nope, just fall straight down the fucking death chamber of the hole that's this big.
[26:02.30]It's literally this big on the ground.
[26:03.62]You go straight fucking down.
[26:07.65]Fucking eat my ass.
[26:11.27]Come on dude.
[26:26.39]Speed is only secondary.
[26:27.41]Just trying to get to the end.
[26:28.57]I mean that thing was right up my ass.
[26:31.69]Yeah, I felt I felt falling twice right there was bad.
[26:36.00]I had a good pace too.
[26:37.80]That was my best ascent ever.
[26:43.33]I feel like I got totally screwed though because... Like there was so much steam dog shit like in that little area.
[26:50.81]And I've only seen the place once.
[26:55.44]I've only seen some of these variations one at a time.
[26:58.82]And now the whole thing is mucked up.
[27:00.74]Hold on.
[27:13.48]Got no food and I had so many items too.
[27:18.31]That's I hate when that happens.
[27:23.19]Oh my God, dude, get up here.
[27:37.86]I was locked.
[27:38.36]I was locked the fucking in that last about to restart.
[27:51.42]Cover that hole with fucking cement.
[27:53.38]How does that sound?
[28:21.35]Come on, dude!
[28:28.53]It's gonna be right behind me.
[28:29.69]I'm taking way too much time here.
[28:33.94]Um, what?
[29:00.15]Oh my god, I'm freaking out.
[29:02.85]I was so mad at the steam that it fucked up- I got up there too.
[29:18.33]Come on, man.
[29:19.17]Am I hitting my head on the fucking ceiling, really?
[29:26.26]What the fuck are you doing?!
[29:28.00]!
[29:35.87]What the fuck is happening?
[29:37.29]What, did I hit my head again?
[29:38.80]I don't get it.
[29:43.28]What the fuck was that?
[29:50.77]Getting stuck on every fucking corner.
[29:59.78]This is a dog shit run.
[30:01.28]This is, I don't know, maybe it'll work out, but this is not going well.
[30:29.10]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[30:30.70]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[30:34.00]It's right behind me.
[30:38.17]It's right underneath me.
[30:43.53]Wish I had food.
[30:45.41]But I don't.
[30:50.38]Come on, man.
[30:51.38]What is this fucking steam placement?
[30:53.00]You're fucking me.
[30:55.26]You're screwing me.
[31:06.78]Stop it!
[31:08.54]Stop!
[31:10.19]Cease!
[31:11.79]Okay.
[31:13.19]Had to say it twice.
[31:14.12]Oh, no!
[31:16.16]Don't laugh at a guy!
[31:18.13]Go!
[31:37.69]Do I even have any items?
[31:40.22]Oh, I'm so screwed.
[31:43.64]This is it.
[31:44.32]Come on.
[31:45.78]Come on.
[31:46.30]I gotta do the Ster strat.
[31:48.41]I hope it works.
[31:49.21]What if it doesn't work?
[31:49.97]I don't know.
[31:50.29]How do you do it?
[31:51.99]How do you do the Ster strat?
[31:52.77]I don't remember how to do it.
[31:54.56]How do you do it?
[32:02.15]I gotta... You can jump, right?
[32:10.11]You are on route to habitation yellow.
[32:13.59]Please enjoy.
[32:14.54]He didn't tell me this thing was electrified!
[32:16.20]Alert.
[32:18.84]Elevator security locks are still in place.
[32:22.79]Manual override will be required.
[32:31.04]Why did I do the thing that he did?
[32:32.76]Deactivated.
[32:38.61]Now I'm screwed.
[33:29.79]Alert.
[33:31.66]Elevator security locks have been released.
[33:35.00]Why did I not... Why was I not able to... Why couldn't I grab it?
[33:39.37]Why couldn't I grab the one that was up there?
[33:42.27]I literally did the jump.
[33:45.07]I couldn't... I didn't... I couldn't reach it.
[33:46.62]I was too far away.
[33:47.84]That's it.
[33:57.77]See you later.
[33:59.86]That was so annoying.
[34:01.23]I shouldn't have fallen down the stupid fucking Act 2 death hole, where it's like, here's the pipe, and the pipe goes up, and then down there, if you don't, you're dead.
[34:19.03]Alright, I'll see you later.
[34:20.55]That was fun.
[34:21.25]Good attempt.
[34:22.88]I'm going to uninstall this game, and you'll never see it ever again on the stream.
[34:26.26]It was a good time.
[34:28.30]It's a good game.
[34:29.60]You should get it.
[34:35.61]I'm kidding.
[34:36.47]I'm kidding.
[34:37.07]It's a joke.
[34:37.95]I'm kidding.
[34:40.15]What about the challenge map?
[34:43.14]I actually am curious about it.
[34:48.32]Sterling climbs up out of the elevator to throw this stuff.
[34:53.89]I don't know.
[34:55.19]Does it save any time?
[34:56.07]I don't know.
[34:59.42]I shouldn't have even tried it.
[35:01.80]I don't even have access to it.
[35:03.24]I have to beat the campaign.
[35:07.57]Like that's ever going to happen.
[35:10.59]It saves seconds at best.
[35:12.78]Yeah.
[35:16.36]I don't know why.
[35:17.12]Maybe I could get it and then people would think it was cool if I did it.
[35:21.83]Oh, wait.
[35:22.21]I can.
[35:23.01]Okay.
[35:23.23]Challenge.
[35:25.38]Roach run?
[35:27.78]I mean, I'm not going to play it too long.
[35:30.01]I just want to check it out.
[36:05.57]Hmm.
[36:08.12]Okay.
[36:20.99]See, that's how far away I thought I was from it when I just died.
[36:27.40]I guess I just wasn't... That jump is so deceiving to me.
[36:30.31]It really is.
[36:31.13]I wish I could have just had the two rebars and just skipped the whole fucking thing, but I didn't have them!
[36:35.60]I only had one anyways, even if I would get all the stuff, so...
[36:48.01]What is this gonna?
[36:49.25]What does this do?
[36:54.38]That was a left click blunder.
[36:55.58]And.
[37:14.33]That's a GG.
[37:15.83]Yeah, that's a GG.
[37:17.88]Yeah, that's a GG.
[37:20.84]That's cool.
[37:21.32]I would want to put more time into it and care about it.
[37:24.77]But that's it.
[37:25.39]That's the end of the stream.
[37:26.03]I just want to do one run on White Knuckle and get really mad at it and talk about how much I hate it.
[37:34.16]And we did just that.
[37:35.14]So, great.
[37:37.45]Next time I'm live, I'll see you maybe in a few days.
[37:42.24]Maybe like Wednesday or so.
[37:44.37]Midweek.
[37:47.01]Those horror games are great.
[37:48.18]Some of those were really funny, really fun.
[37:50.36]Had a lot of fun.
[37:50.90]White Knuckle is a great game, too, if you haven't played it.
[37:53.97]And that'll be it.
[37:56.17]See you guys on Wednesday or Thursday, probably midweek.
[37:59.86]Take care of yourselves.
[38:00.76]Have a great rest of your night.
[38:02.04]Thanks for watching.
[38:02.94]This is a long one.
[38:03.96]Jesus, that was like seven and a half hours.
[38:06.69]That is a long game.
[38:09.35]Stream.
[38:13.48]Uh, I do need to get this reset back up because it's not correct.
[38:32.91]It is a, oh my God, it's late.
[38:34.03]It's midnight.
[38:35.31]If it's midnight Eastern or Pacific, that means it's like three plus a.m.
[38:39.38]Damn.
[38:46.99]Have a great night.
[38:48.24]Goodbye.
[38:53.47]Looks like a lot of subs.
[38:57.36]Appreciate it.
[38:57.76]Thanks, guys.
[39:04.95]Next stream, I think I'm going to do... We'll do some retro stuff next stream.
[39:10.27]I'm probably going to do a chill stream next stream.
[39:12.56]So it might be a little bit later in the afternoon start.
[39:15.90]No cam, just kind of hanging out.
[39:31.34]Should be chill.
[39:32.49]Should be fun.
[39:34.61]When are you going to cut your hair?
[39:37.89]I don't know.
[39:39.72]I haven't decided the date to get rid of it.
[39:42.61]I just know it's going to be fairly soon.
[39:54.58]White knuckle and alcohol don't mix.
[39:57.62]I don't know, man.
[39:58.32]I got my best descent into Act 2 doing that.
[40:02.67]I just tried to get too cute with it and I knew what I was doing.
[40:05.31]I was like, oh, this is really fucking cute and stupid what I'm doing.
[40:09.86]But I figured I could get like a PogChamp moment.
[40:14.10]And it was more of a pog fail.
[40:29.07]See you later.
[40:32.53]Take care of yourselves.
[40:33.32]Have a great rest of your night.
[40:34.80]Get some sleep if you haven't already.
[40:38.54]I'll see you guys soon.
[40:41.17]Call your mother.
[40:41.75]And take care.
[41:12.96]you
