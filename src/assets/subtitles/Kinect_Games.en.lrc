[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.69]Hey.
[00:04.33]Why is everybody still saying late?
[00:05.89]I don't understand that anymore.
[00:09.29]I've had a window between 3 and 4 o'clock Pacific for like six months.
[00:14.53]What are you guys talking about?
[00:16.09]I'm pretty damn early.
[00:25.46]You never had a goddamn guy come to your house in a window before?
[00:38.81]Sounds like a worker coming to your house in a window.
[00:42.91]Okay, a guy comes to your house because you asked him to come there because he's doing a job.
[00:51.72]And he gave you a window of when he will arrive.
[00:54.72]There you go.
[00:56.66]Have you...
[01:19.52]Alright, I'm here.
[01:20.94]I have to kneel down.
[01:23.02]Because I have to... I don't have a chair in here right now.
[01:25.71]Because, as you probably saw by the title of the stream and by... The latest tweet.
[01:32.47]We're doing Kinect.
[01:33.11]That's right.
[01:36.25]I have... Way too many of these games.
[01:41.74]It was a mistake to buy this many.
[01:45.88]Half of these...
[01:48.42]I don't think have seen... Well, okay, let's put it this way.
[01:52.50]The one that I'm about to start with, I don't think has seen total playtime across the entire globe from every purchase.
[02:04.01]Probably more than 16 hours of time that anyone has ever spent in this game across the whole globe.
[02:09.33]I can't... I don't know.
[02:09.95]I don't understand who would... Maybe...
[02:14.15]We are going to account for, like, 30% of this game's total global playtime.
[02:19.36]Hope you're ready.
[02:20.48]It's not Forza.
[02:25.78]Why would I... I'm not gonna play Forza right now.
[02:30.59]Is Forza for Kinect?
[02:35.65]Because... Should I have gotten Forza instead of... Uh...
[02:45.36]The biggest loser weight loss game?
[02:48.88]What do you think?
[02:55.76]We're talking fucking weight loss today.
[02:59.63]I'm in my gear.
[03:00.55]I'm ready to work out.
[03:02.51]This stream is going to probably be like fucking two hours because you all know how much stamina I got.
[03:14.71]Nah, I'm kidding.
[03:16.95]I've warmed up before.
[03:19.11]I did a little bit of, like, stretches and sit-ups and stuff.
[03:22.36]I'm ready.
[03:24.18]I'm ready for at least... Play online.
[03:30.14]You can't play this game online.
[03:34.36]No camera?
[03:34.86]Oh, there we go.
[03:35.38]Absolutely, there's a camera.
[03:37.28]It's going on.
[03:38.54]Not yet, though.
[03:39.68]Wait, it's only been, like, a minute.
[03:42.10]Just waiting for... I just did a tweet.
[03:46.69]I got a cool setup this time.
[03:49.89]So those of you that watched the, uh, the movies one from a few days ago with the Xbox Live Vision camera?
[03:56.47]No, no, no, no.
[03:57.05]Today, take a look at this.
[04:00.72]Today, I've got something interesting here.
[04:05.52]Must have been sad for a minute there.
[04:07.64]I got something interesting here.
[04:10.12]Wireless Bluetooth setup.
[04:13.78]Wireless Bluetooth setup.
[04:16.70]From here, no wires.
[04:18.68]Check that out.
[04:19.22]No wires, nothing on me at all.
[04:21.04]You see?
[04:22.88]I got a Bluetooth setup over here.
[04:24.50]That means I can roam.
[04:26.28]It's not like, ah, get that off me.
[04:28.04]No, no, no.
[04:29.84]I'm good.
[04:32.98]It's connected.
[04:34.20]I had no way to put it.
[04:35.00]I was going to get a haircut yesterday, but I didn't do it.
[04:39.24]So the hair stays.
[04:41.28]Wait, how does this look?
[04:44.29]I really don't want to turn this on because this music is fucking terrible, but it's on.
[04:50.68]Check this out.
[04:53.40]Yeah, that's right.
[04:54.22]It's been calibrated.
[04:59.44]I think.
[05:01.22]Okay, yeah, it's been calibrated.
[05:02.81]Oh, I gotta, hold on, wait, wait, I gotta flip my... Because if I go like this...
[05:10.92]Yeah, I gotta flip.
[05:11.66]I gotta flip myself.
[05:13.02]Because it's pulling me the other way.
[05:14.58]Hold on.
[05:16.50]We're gonna mirror this.
[05:20.14]Because now... There you go.
[05:28.30]Alright.
[05:30.90]So, put the fat suit on.
[05:35.50]I'm not gonna put the fat suit on for this.
[05:38.84]Guys, we don't have time to fuck around.
[05:41.36]You understand?
[05:45.38]I don't have time to fuck around, okay?
[05:48.73]I knew that was going to fucking happen.
[05:54.15]It's alright.
[05:54.77]They're fine over there.
[05:57.77]I got 40.
[05:58.85]We got 40 games for the Kinect.
[06:01.41]It's going to take us like six weeks to do this.
[06:03.23]I just spit all over you.
[06:08.73]This was four grand.
[06:14.39]There's a light.
[06:21.51]Ah, red.
[06:22.27]I'm stalling.
[06:25.63]It's time to go.
[06:27.99]This was not four grand.
[06:29.09]That's a lie.
[06:29.43]All right, here we go.
[06:30.21]You ready?
[06:32.87]It's time.
[06:33.39]Is this what you do?
[06:34.74]No.
[06:34.80]All right, here we go.
[06:36.89]This is the worst one to start with, but I have to get rid of this one quick.
[06:41.02]By the way, we have a rule here, if you've never been here before.
[06:45.22]Every single one of these games I have to play for at least 30 minutes.
[06:47.80]What time is it right now?
[06:51.13]Seven minutes.
[06:52.71]Stop the timer now.
[06:53.41]Biggest loser, here we go.
[06:54.75]Wireless Bluetooth setup.
[06:55.85]I have to calibrate it, okay.
[07:05.51]Enter your weight.
[07:06.63]Use the up and down arrow to change your weight.
[07:13.56]No, no, no, that's not... Are you ready to have fun and get real results?
[07:18.08]I'm ready.
[07:22.40]This is so difficult.
[07:31.59]Alright!
[07:33.61]I'm on like 154.
[07:36.14]Hey, uh, take the CD out of the tray.
[07:38.32]You don't have to fucking be here.
[07:39.60]Okay, let's go.
[07:42.82]Imagine being 154 pounds and, like, getting this game and being like, you know, I've got it.
[07:48.57]I've got to drop, like, 40.
[07:50.35]Choose a personalized program if you want a custom fitness program tailored to your body and your personal strengths and weaknesses.
[07:55.77]Creating your program will be able to test the gauge of your current fitness.
[08:00.41]What'd you do?
[08:01.29]No, no, no, no.
[08:01.80]I want to do the custom one, like the Wii Fit one.
[08:05.76]Personalized program, and we're gonna test my current fitness level.
[08:10.23]Sounds good.
[08:14.55]30 minute- hey, that's just as much time for me to fucking uninstall the game.
[08:18.67]Fitness test is to find your current fitness level.
[08:21.00]Just follow Bob Harper as he leads you through a series of exercises.
[08:24.86]If it gets too hard for you, the test will end and we'll look at your results.
[08:28.12]Okay, good luck.
[08:28.78]Thanks for giving me that time limit.
[08:29.90]Here we go.
[08:30.26]Fitness test starting now.
[08:42.33]I'm going to stretch my spine out.
[08:44.11]Here's a quick little technique for those who don't know.
[08:45.71]If you want to stretch your spine out, go on your tiptoes real fast.
[08:51.10]Okay, I elongated my body for a moment.
[08:52.72]Now we're going to do a short fitness test with you to find out your current fitness level.
[08:57.05]You can end the test at any time.
[08:59.05]Take it away, Bob.
[09:00.11]We'll start with a light warm-up exercise, but things will get progressively harder.
[09:04.25]Remember that you can stop at any time if things get too difficult.
[09:07.69]The test will end automatically if your performance drops below a certain level.
[09:12.26]Let's go.
[09:13.32]All right, I gotta be good.
[09:16.02]Arm swings.
[09:16.36]Oh, I don't know if I can do this, Bob.
[09:17.26]Alright, I burned one calorie.
[09:18.36]It's time to end the game.
[09:41.65]Why am I blue?
[09:42.17]Let's move on to some side steps.
[09:44.21]Oh, no, not side steps!
[09:46.03]Make sure you don't make your steps too wide.
[09:52.19]These are... Bob, I don't know if I can handle this.
[09:54.55]You might have to call the test early.
[09:56.89]Perfect form.
[10:03.46]I do this shit, like, live at fucking, like, fast food restaurants.
[10:07.44]I just, like, I can do this all day.
[10:09.90]I'm a fidgety fuck.
[10:12.61]This is too hard, I'm keepin' up.
[10:14.97]This is too hard, I'm keepin' up.
[10:17.03]I'm feelin' good.
[10:17.61]Oh, that was me saying that to Bob.
[10:19.21]Okay, Bob.
[10:19.57]This is too hard.
[10:36.45]That's exactly what I'm after.
[10:37.91]This is for, like, old ladies.
[10:40.53]Good job.
[10:41.39]Keep that rhythm going.
[10:43.76]And just march on the spot.
[10:45.10]Arms and legs move alternately.
[10:46.88]This is a nice and easy way to warm up your entire body.
[10:49.76]Stay with it.
[10:52.57]Try to land your feet softly.
[10:54.41]Don't stand.
[11:00.54]If you could move your arms a little more for me, that would be great.
[11:03.60]All right, Bob, I got spinal problems.
[11:06.02]I can't do this.
[11:09.16]If you're going a little slow, just keep going.
[11:11.30]And when you feel ready, move, move more arms.
[11:13.90]Like the people that walk the people that like are on the sidewalk that go like this, move your legs a little more.
[11:25.74]If you can't let me knee higher.
[11:29.21]You guys don't even need the fucking face cam.
[11:34.41]This exercise will get that heart rate up.
[11:37.73]Faster isn't always better.
[11:39.41]Make sure you're matching your trainer and concentrate on perfect form.
[11:43.95]Good job.
[11:44.83]Keep that rhythm going.
[11:47.69]This is actually, I'm starting to get a little winded.
[11:49.39]I've only burned eight calories?
[11:51.75]Don't forget that going too fast will count against you.
[11:57.67]Fuck that man, I'll just eat one less bag of potato chips every day.
[12:01.42]It's not, just do that.
[12:06.54]How many calories is a bag of potato chips?
[12:11.46]It's like 325 calories for one bag of Lay's potato chips.
[12:16.60]If you just didn't eat the bag of potato chips, you wouldn't have to do this whole exercise.
[12:22.76]Thinking face, you know what I'm saying?
[12:24.56]All right, let's go.
[12:27.23]Start the light station?
[12:31.31]What the fuck is that?
[12:39.57]Woodchops.
[12:40.29]With this one, I want you to swing your arms down and to the left as if you're chopping down a tree.
[12:45.73]Execute a nice controlled motion.
[12:48.05]Don't throw your arms down.
[12:49.83]Also, be sure to bend your right knee and twist your core as you chop.
[12:55.80]don't throw your body around control movement don't be thinking about swinging down place the arm over your shoulder does this work I don't think this works feeling the burn yeah I'm feeling it that burn means that you are working those muscles hard I'm not feeling I'm not feeling good at all I don't feel anything
[13:26.43]I would laugh my ass off.
[13:28.35]Okay, now let's get on there.
[13:29.95]Get on the ground.
[13:30.73]Let's do 150 push-ups.
[13:32.81]You can do it.
[13:43.32]Do you have any weights?
[13:45.72]Go get two 50-pound dumbbells.
[13:48.01]Hold them over your head and scream.
[13:53.53]Hold that form.
[14:02.45]30 minutes.
[14:03.42]That's all the time we have for in this one.
[14:07.10]Back off the cool down period.
[14:13.42]Arms up in boxer position and sway from side to side as if you're ducking and dodging punches.
[14:18.85]Dip down as you sway and try to keep it nice and rhythmic.
[14:24.25]Don't dip too low as you might overextend your knees.
[14:28.51]Pick it up.
[14:29.33]Think how proud you'll be if you get this right.
[14:32.61]Try to duck down lower if you can.
[14:40.53]Try to reach the same speed as the trainer to perform the exercise, burn major calories, and earn maximum points.
[14:47.65]Try to duck down lower if you can.
[14:57.18]So anytime you see like a fitness exercise video, this is great, do this in your spare time.
[15:01.74]Go to any of these old fitness instruction video things and watch like the people in the back, the people that aren't in the front row, right?
[15:08.94]Because they really, this is a camera, people in the front row are like, oh, look at that, there's that lady.
[15:13.63]Holy shit, look at my face.
[15:16.31]Hold on, wait a minute.
[15:23.21]We're staying at a low intensity with this exercise.
[15:47.05]It looks like you're moving from side to side a lot.
[15:49.41]Try to stay in one place more.
[15:56.35]I'm gonna get such a bad duck.
[15:57.30]Alright, no more fucking around.
[15:58.42]...to perfect the exercise, burn major calories, and earn maximum points.
[16:03.68]A little quicker.
[16:07.48]If you're going a little slow, just keep going, and when you feel ready, you can try to pick it up a bit.
[16:12.18]Anyways, what I was saying is, the people in the back, all the way in the back, they're always doing it so fucking wrong.
[16:19.02]They're just extras.
[16:21.18]Even something as simple as running in place like this, they'll go like this.
[16:30.10]Oh, fuck.
[16:34.86]I feel like I've burned like 2,000 calories.
[16:38.48]Would you like to continue to moderate?
[16:44.58]Working on it is hard.
[16:54.95]I'm not going to get over that.
[16:56.01]I wish I could get a close-up.
[16:57.09]Getting down into a sitting position now.
[17:02.06]Why is my nose so big?
[17:02.74]My nose is not this big.
[17:03.64]What the fuck?
[17:04.00]Oh shit.
[17:04.50]I can't see.
[17:05.54]What do you want me to do?
[17:06.92]I don't even know what- I'm flapping my arms down here like a bird?
[17:31.37]If that's what I'm talking about, great.
[17:34.72]It's talking to me, it's talking to people behind you.
[17:45.65]Lift and release.
[17:49.73]Relax and release.
[17:55.84]Breathe out as you lift your hips.
[18:02.74]Faster isn't always better.
[18:04.42]Make sure you're matching your trainer.
[18:06.23]Oh, thank God for the cool down.
[18:08.65]Let's mix things up with something else now.
[18:10.69]No, I don't want to.
[18:11.67]I want to get up.
[18:12.39]My spine.
[18:12.98]I got a bad spine.
[18:14.00]Now come back into a plank position.
[18:16.74]Okay, I can do that.
[18:19.86]And now let's go side on.
[18:22.69]let's do some hip extensions stretch your left arm out in front of you and at the same time extend your right leg out behind you what do you want what pull your arm and leg back in together keeping your hips level now stretch it back out again keep your hips in line with one another
[18:41.10]If you're going a little slow, just keep going.
[18:43.24]And when you feel ready, you can try to pick it up.
[18:46.00]I think I need a drink.
[18:48.78]I think I need a drink.
[18:52.12]Let's take a few seconds to rehydrate at the end of the exercise.
[18:55.02]Then we'll continue.
[18:57.00]Okay.
[18:57.56]Good job, guys.
[18:58.16]Let's move to the other side now.
[19:05.22]I'm drinking soda at the gym.
[19:07.46]What kind of dickhead are you?
[19:16.67]Holding everybody up.
[19:20.11]You good, man?
[19:21.15]No, not yet.
[19:23.03]Hey, well, there's like 37 other people in this class.
[19:27.87]Wait.
[19:28.01]You're good.
[19:34.33]All right, I'm good.
[19:34.97]I got my drink of cold class.
[19:40.35]Fucking, this thing ain't got shit on the Wii mode, I'll tell you.
[19:42.72]That's why I failed it.
[19:45.42]Turn to the side for this exercise.
[19:48.39]So take the other leg out and extend the other arm forward.
[19:58.20]Come on.
[20:00.84]Squeezing into your glutes.
[20:03.88]I don't want to get on the ground.
[20:04.80]I don't want to get on the ground.
[20:06.30]The ground is dirty.
[20:07.37]Fucking dust and dirt on there.
[20:19.47]Don't rush.
[20:23.42]To succeed, follow your trainer's movements closely.
[20:25.96]Alright, I did it.
[20:33.13]How did we do?
[20:33.89]Tend to de-ragoon!
[20:35.65]Tend to de-ragoon!
[20:39.85]Hold on, my... Oh shit, what happened here?
[20:44.47]My wireless setup got fucked up.
[20:47.62]Alright, best exercise, the march.
[20:48.94]Worst exercise, hit proficiency.
[20:50.66]Let's see.
[20:54.11]Hold on, I just got fucked up.
[20:55.25]I gotta change this.
[21:01.37]That's better, okay.
[21:02.71]You performed really well and reached the moderate level.
[21:04.52]That was a great start.
[21:10.04]Alright.
[21:10.28]106 points.
[21:12.72]Turn it off, turn it off, turn it off, turn it off quick, turn it off.
[21:19.53]What other games do I have?
[21:20.47]Too many.
[21:27.10]How is this the biggest loser?
[21:29.72]This is just like a shitty workout game.
[21:38.48]What year were you born?
[21:39.36]Should I say I'm like fucking like a hundred?
[21:42.67]I'm going for it.
[21:43.41]I went into the intense workout today.
[21:54.78]Alright, let's say I was born in like 1921.
[21:56.89]Interesting choice.
[22:01.47]9, 2, 1.
[22:04.57]September 21st, Carnival Stream.
[22:06.39]Make sure you get there if you want to see some fun.
[22:12.43]When was I born?
[22:13.13]I don't know.
[22:13.51]Fucking March.
[22:18.13]March 1921.
[22:18.59]I don't know.
[22:22.23]Stop fucking data mining me.

[23:08.68]Okay.
[23:13.46]With your feet together and your hands away from your sides.
[23:15.80]Arms up like this.
[23:22.74]Turn to your left and raise your arms to match the outline.
[23:40.26]That's not right.
[23:41.44]That is inaccurate.
[23:43.04]That's inaccurate.
[23:43.76]It's because of where I'm standing.
[23:45.30]I'm not fucking 5'4".
[23:47.96]This is from like 2006, guys.
[23:50.92]The technology didn't exist.
[23:59.23]Waist, hips 31.
[24:00.29]I mean, that's accurate.
[24:02.71]Neck 163.
[24:06.77]Hold on, like, how big is that?
[24:11.44]163 inches?
[24:13.28]That's like a fucking bullfrog.
[24:17.74]That's not correct.
[24:25.25]Place the tape around your neck and adjust below the, I don't know, it's, I, whatever, you did it, I didn't.
[24:34.05]Change that fucking height.
[24:36.13]That's not accurate.
[24:50.66]Now it's fucking accurate.
[24:53.76]It's bullshit, and it's because of the way this is pointing.
[24:56.04]Video games are stupid.
[24:57.16]You shouldn't have- don't play them anymore.
[24:58.58]Alright.

[25:11.02]The overall fitness training program will help you lose weight, improve your fitness, and increase your stamina.
[25:15.24]My focus should be on my butt.
[25:18.44]Or, what does that mean?
[25:19.50]Full body.
[25:24.14]Choose your own program.
[25:26.68]Choose your own muscle focus.
[25:28.78]No, no, no.
[25:29.36]What does it want me to focus on?
[25:33.94]It said I had a great ass.
[25:36.04]That's not me saying that.
[25:36.94]That's the game.
[25:40.28]Right?
[25:41.36]Yeah.

[26:22.58]The icon under today shows that you have training scheduled.
[26:26.20]You can log out now and resume at a later date.
[26:28.68]That's not good.
[26:29.98]That's not encouraging.
[26:32.32]This is supposed to be a fitness program.
[26:33.74]This is supposed to be a fitness instructor.
[26:37.00]You don't say, oh, hey, you could start today.
[26:38.66]Oh, you know, you could come back like another day.
[26:40.68]Just turn it off.
[26:43.65]Oh, you can log, just get, you can log out now.
[26:45.77]Yeah, I guess I could log out now.
[26:47.19]And then I'll just put it back in the shelf and I'll never use it again.
[26:48.93]All right, what's the activity?

[35:31.00]When running, pick up medallions by sticking your arms out to the side or above your head.
[35:35.16]The green medallions are good and will lower your final time.
[35:38.02]Watch out for the red medallions.
[35:39.23]These are bad and will add to your final time.

[44:30.07]I ate a fucking tuna sandwich before this.
[44:32.87]I'm full of protein.
[44:33.55]I'm good.
[44:35.32]I had the tuna casserole!

[46:15.78]I'm not doing this shit again.
[46:16.92]Hold on, this is like...
[46:28.00]Okay, that was fun.
[46:30.54]Don't really know.
[47:04.22]All right, that's enough of that.
[47:06.99]Time to do something different.
[47:10.51]That was a 47 minute workout.
[47:18.97]Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[47:25.76]What the fuck are you doing?
[47:34.86]What the hell was that?
[47:36.78]Secure HDCP link lost?
[47:47.96]I don't think I can do this one.
[47:53.28]Well, fuck.
[47:55.74]That's annoying.
[47:58.36]Huh.
[47:59.78]Reboot it?
[48:00.20]All right, I'm just gonna reboot it.
[48:10.12]There is a very high chance, guys.
[48:12.26]I don't know what the exact probability of this happening is, but this thing might break.
[48:17.54]I might burn out the 360 over the next, like, 12 hours for these games.
[48:26.29]Okay, here we go.
[48:27.43]Because it doesn't say it right here.
[48:28.45]It only says it when I load up this next game that is actually probably for the best because nobody's going to want to see this one because why would you?
[48:35.81]Hold on.
[48:38.41]What's my favorite food?
[48:39.11]Fucking buffalo chicken.
[48:51.78]What?
[48:55.24]The issue can occur if you... This is coming too fast.
[48:58.16]There is a home theater tuner AV switch box between your Xbox... Well, I have to capture it through a capture card, so maybe some of these... Let's try it one more time.
[49:09.54]Yeah, but the 360 has to go through a capture card, otherwise it can't go to the computer.
[49:13.34]No.
[49:13.46]This one ain't gonna work.
[49:17.63]Well... For the best.
[49:20.61]It was enough workout DVD.
[49:29.04]Oh, well.
[49:33.16]Alright, let's actually move on to something more than just, like, training.
[49:39.02]There we go.
[49:41.66]I'm fucking looking forward to this one.
[49:46.14]All right, let's hope that doesn't happen on like half of these.
[49:55.80]Don't touch the back of the CD with your greasy hands.
[49:58.70]It's gonna be all right.
[50:02.78]All right, come on, don't do that again.
[50:05.80]I think we're good.
[50:07.26]We are.
[50:08.43]This is a compilation.
[50:16.31]Does soda dehydrate you?
[50:18.44]I had to do it because I'm wearing this shirt.
[50:23.06]What if I just lifted up my fucking whole shirt and there was a huge Coca-Cola brand logo tattoo right here?
[50:33.29]And it was fresh.
[50:34.52]You could see the irritation on the skin.
[50:36.58]It was like, ah, and it was like a little thing across it.
[50:40.34]I got it like an hour and a half ago.
[50:44.28]Wait, can't identify?
[50:53.01]Tender Dragoon, recognized.
[50:55.33]You've been identified as Tender Dragoon, confirmed.
[50:58.35]Yes.
[51:03.59]Am I gonna make the facecam bigger or anything?
[51:07.47]I shrunk it.
[51:07.93]There we go, that's better.
[51:11.02]Memory unit.
[51:12.12]Use that one.
[51:13.66]Use it.
[51:16.00]Yeah, use this fucking one, please.
[51:20.52]Use that one.
[51:28.95]What was that?
[51:29.51]I got, like, buzzed.
[51:34.40]No... Just use the same one that you're already using!
[51:44.16]How many save files does a game fucking have?
[51:46.08]Alright, this is Motion Sports.
[51:51.82]It's highly rated.
[51:52.62]It's on every Top 10 Kinect Games list you can find.
[51:57.02]There are two.
[51:58.62]There are two of those lists.
[52:02.08]You are now entering the world of motion sports.
[52:05.74]Now let's get this puppy calibrated just right.
[52:08.99]Place your hand over the top left virtual panel and leave it there for a few seconds.
[52:14.33]What hand?
[52:14.77]Left hand?
[52:15.31]I didn't hear what he said.
[52:17.20]Left hand?
[52:17.76]And now, place shoe on hand or pre-recorded.
[52:26.69]Perfect.
[52:27.57]Now place your hand over the bottom right panel and again, leave it there for a few seconds.
[52:34.08]Great.
[52:34.74]You're a natural.
[52:35.98]Finally, place your hand over the top right panel and once again, leave it there.
[52:41.32]Brilliant.
[52:42.42]Now the fun begins.
[52:43.99]Hold your hand out in front of you and slide to the right.
[52:47.51]Why?
[52:51.06]Perfect.
[52:52.06]Now we're gonna take three photos of you as you would like the world to see you.
[52:56.64]No pressure now.
[52:58.24]Okay, when you're ready to enter the photo shoot, hold your hand out in front of you.
[53:02.84]And again, slide to the right.
[53:05.10]Ready?
[53:13.89]Okay, first photo.
[53:15.61]Throw your hands in the air like you just don't care.
[53:18.47]Unless someone you're attracted to is around.
[53:21.41]Hold your pose until the camera flashes.
[53:24.78]Alright, second photo.
[53:26.60]Pretend like you just won a million bucks.
[53:29.64]Hold for the flash.
[53:33.00]Great, and now for the last photo.
[53:35.68]Show me your muscles.
[53:37.84]Wait for the flash.
[53:41.24]Sweet, magazines will pay gold for these.
[53:45.07]Great, now let's play some motion sports.
[53:50.04]I don't do fucking anything else but this every time.
[54:02.45]Horseback riding is the first one we're doing.
[54:04.17]I don't care.
[54:07.05]Beginner course.
[54:08.09]Beginner course.
[54:15.97]Is it going to be actually me on the horse?
[54:18.19]Oh, what a fantastic game this would be.
[54:21.79]This one's going to be boring.
[54:22.95]Oh, he said boxing.
[54:24.41]We're going to do ball.
[54:26.57]This is motion sports.
[54:27.39]I got like two or three other fucking sports.
[54:29.70]We'll do those another time.
[54:32.26]I'm looking at that stack over there.
[54:33.44]This is going to take like three weeks.
[54:35.80]This is going to take like ten streams to do all this.
[54:40.70]Hey.
[54:40.82]You know what I'm saying?
[54:44.77]Fine.
[54:45.37]Fine.
[54:50.51]How to guide your horse.
[54:55.01]I didn't even see what that said.
[54:56.35]Don't say slide to continue.
[54:57.78]I didn't even see what it said.
[55:04.64]Hello all, today we're thrilled to bring you one of Equestrian's most brilliant performers.
[55:10.75]Maybe not the most stringent course he'll ever face, but also not one to take for granted.
[55:15.99]Really wants a great story.
[55:19.31]He failed to make a jump move, and his horse is refusing.
[55:22.39]How did he do that?
[55:28.91]Jump!
[55:30.14]Couldn't handle the simple vertical.
[55:32.34]It cannot be taken for granted.
[55:37.62]Whoa.
[55:38.30]Hey, Magellan, the course is over here.
[55:45.73]It didn't teach me how to play.
[55:51.34]How do you jump?
[55:51.94]Do I have to say something?
[55:54.83]Horse refuses again.
[56:05.87]Do I have to jump?
[56:06.75]Am I controlling the horse too?

[67:20.80]Why did I go twice?
[67:48.61]This is taking it more out of me than any of the other ones.
[67:50.25]The Jillian Michaels fucking... A 2.2 kids and corner office and 30 years kind of guy.
[67:52.73]Alright, I did it.
[67:53.19]Smoke it.

[68:38.57]I need some cool air.
[68:55.03]Okay.
[68:55.25]Fucking narcissist, man.
[69:09.24]Who cares about that?
[69:18.22]They're not going to show up anywhere.
[69:28.31]Mugshot.
[69:33.31]Has it been 30 minutes on this one?
[69:39.32]The Amazonian devil, Professor Tom.
[69:45.52]Alright.
[69:46.18]No?
[69:46.24]Alright.
[69:46.42]How much time we got?
[69:49.71]Got like another 15, 20 minutes.
[69:59.21]This is boxing.
[70:01.47]I gotta be ready to fuckin' lay somebody out.
[70:08.78]He better play everything.
[70:10.98]We're gonna play everything, don't you worry.
[70:13.62]I have to clean up as we go though, cause there's so many discs over here.
[70:16.98]I will ruin the room and it'll be, it'll just be a cluttered, uncomfortable, hoarder feeling in this room.
[70:22.57]It happens sometimes.
[70:28.45]Perry!
[70:31.45]Raise your hands in front of your face.
[70:34.11]Throw a quick straight punch to the face or stomach.
[70:40.02]Throw a semi-circular punch to the head of the body.
[70:45.18]Do an uppercut.
[70:47.45]Do a parry.
[70:48.47]Raise your hands in front of your face.
[70:49.61]Your guard can be broken if you keep parrying without attacking.
[70:51.91]Alright, so you just beat him up.
[70:54.55]Just punch the guy for a while.
[70:57.71]For those who love boxing, get ready to witness The Dream, one of this sport's superior talents.
[71:05.09]The Amazonian Devil, very quick-handed opponent, loves the jab and really puts punches together well.
[71:12.78]Doesn't have true punching power though.
[71:15.14]Look for the Dream to take some of those jabs in order to get inside and do real punching damage.
[71:21.32]And here goes Dream, trying to end it all.
[71:25.41]Three knockdown rule in effect.
[71:27.45]If it goes to the scorecards, landing a lot of blows and a high percentage is key.
[71:33.09]Sucks in a jab and wobbling.
[71:36.45]Oh, looking to finish him off.
[71:40.10]eats the stiff jab oh my takes a stinging jab halfway through round one cleans up on him has him hurt and in trouble trying to finish him hurt him earlier with a hard left did not get the knockout dream not likely to punch himself out
[72:08.43]Bam!
[72:09.44]Now he's a sitting duck.
[72:11.96]Dream lighting him up.
[72:14.02]Ten seconds left in this round.
[72:16.68]Oh, wobbles his legs.
[72:19.48]Dream delivering punishment here.
[72:22.48]Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.
[72:25.76]I thought it was a tactical knockout.
[72:30.37]Three times you go down, that's TKO.
[72:33.60]It really wasn't at all, actually.
[72:35.02]It was pretty lame.
[73:03.50]I'm telling you, though, if you give me one of those machines, I will go over like 600, 700, 800 pounds per square inch.
[73:09.14]One of those punching machines.
[73:12.36]We already talked about it.
[73:13.22]You guys already know this.
[73:21.21]I will prove that one day on camera, I promise.
[73:29.58]Oh, more of this.
[73:32.39]I don't even want to take these anymore because like where are they going?
[73:34.90]They're probably going to like fucking... server somewhere.
[73:39.78]Alright, what did we not do?
[73:46.53]Hang gliding?
[73:52.69]They're going straight to my PC?

[74:23.40]All right, so how do we do this?
[74:38.56]Guess I ain't leaving.
[74:46.98]Oh, that's me.
[74:47.66]I did that.
[74:48.06]So I don't want to be disturbed while I play Connect.
[74:52.13]Okay, raise your left arm to turn right.
[74:54.99]Just kind of with piano hands.
[74:58.49]So piano hands, lower arms to nose dive.
[75:02.13]Lift up, tilt, tilt.
[75:06.55]Like this.
[75:07.19]Okay, if you were going, uh, gaining altitude.
[75:10.91]Alright, I got it.
[75:15.09]I'm gonna stay here.
[75:17.61]I tried to hold it.
[75:18.43]If you hold it in, you can actually, like, fucking kill yourself.
[75:20.27]Alright.
[75:20.49]That's very- Apparently it's very windy!
[75:21.57]I'm not sure what he was thinking!

[76:15.53]Hold on.
[76:20.92]Back from the Dead.
[76:25.64]I don't like that one.
[76:26.46]I don't like that one.

[78:47.78]That's some big air.
[78:56.74]Getting thrown down.
[78:58.20]Oh, getting swirly out there.

[79:43.14]Big mistake there.
[79:45.00]I have to do something fucking crazy.
[79:53.16]I should do that the whole time.
[80:02.20]I should stay as a ball.
[80:15.38]Did not finish.
[80:19.32]You see me doing the cry.
[80:23.82]Watch it right there.
[80:26.58]When I'm leaning this way, I'm doing the cry.
[80:39.49]Alright, I think I've seen what I want to see in this one.
[80:41.74]We've got a lot more.
[80:52.58]Unless there's something... I want to see the quarterback one.
[80:59.98]Why do you have to put these behind a time gate, whatever the hell they are, over a point gate?
[81:05.20]Come on.
[81:07.05]I want to throw the football.
[81:09.23]It's at the back of the box.
[81:10.39]I want to throw it at the back of the box.
[81:16.23]By the way, I got two horror games.
[81:23.48]I feel tired.
[81:37.29]I assure you, I'm not insane.
[81:40.17]Why did I start with the Jillian Michaels shit?
[81:44.15]It blew all my energy.
[81:46.53]In the first 40 minutes of the stream, I knew that was gonna happen.
[81:51.18]I'm going to get a second win.
[81:52.32]I'm good.
[81:52.86]I'm good.
[81:53.30]I'm going to be fine.
[81:57.74]Running back, quarterback, kicker.
[82:00.14]I just... Hold on.
[82:01.98]Let me... I want to see what that is.
[82:03.32]I have to.
[82:04.70]We're past the 30-minute mark on this now.
[82:07.10]But it doesn't matter.
[82:07.92]I have to.
[82:09.10]I need... I got... I have to throw the quarterback balls.
[82:16.16]Am I distinct?
[82:17.34]I shouldn't be.
[82:18.22]Let's test it.
[82:31.26]A bit?
[82:32.10]By how much?
[82:34.17]What's happening first?

[83:39.01]By the way, that paraglider is fucking dead.
[83:40.56]He's not coming back walking.
[83:42.26]I don't think so either.
[83:44.06]Thanks for the huge amount of fucking money.
[83:46.02]Thanks for more than like $1,500 in the last week.
[83:49.76]That's insanity.
[83:52.26]Thank you.
[83:52.60]All right.
[83:56.91]Let me get this fixed.
[84:00.48]That's a lot of fucking money.
[84:06.44]So, sound is early.

[85:32.77]Now it's late.
[85:34.60]Computers don't ever have one.
[85:40.84]Alright, how about this?
[85:54.75]What?
[85:56.35]That's impossible.
[85:59.15]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[87:52.22]Hold on.
[87:53.98]It's time.
[87:55.08]It's time to move on to the meat and fucking potatoes of this stream.
[87:57.78]Are you ready?
[87:58.26]That was a spoiler.

[88:21.13]You guys have fucking given so much subs.
[88:23.73]Thank you.
[88:31.74]The connect is the path to money.
[88:36.36]No, there's no way this is out of sync.
[88:37.57]It's impossible.
[88:38.51]The audio and the video are both set to 650 milliseconds.
[88:42.29]Delayed.
[88:43.67]There's no way.
[88:50.48]It's literally technically impossible.
[88:58.43]Somebody give me a clip.
[88:59.33]I want to prove this to the world and myself.
[89:05.81]Clip that.
[89:06.18]Let me see it.
[89:07.24]Right now.
[89:09.14]Let me see it right now.
[89:20.81]Why is nobody clipping that?
[89:34.98]Oh, by the way, we're playing fucking Harry Potter.
[89:39.90]Just in case you were curious.
[89:43.86]It's literally technically impossible.
[89:51.78]Somebody give me a clip.
[89:52.68]I want to prove this to the world.
[89:54.46]And myself.
[89:59.16]Clip that.
[90:00.27]You fucking dickheads.
[90:02.51]Shit's fine.

[90:15.66]Thanks for the wild.
[90:18.00]Appreciate the fucking 10 subs.
[90:30.02]I just watched the clip.
[90:31.72]It's very clearly... It happens if... I don't... It's over.
[90:34.90]It's fine.
[90:35.34]I got my fucking Bluetooth connection wireless set up.
[90:38.20]I'm playing Harry Potter for Connect.
[90:39.42]Alright, I gotta get in here.

[91:44.23]I think it's- I think it's fine.
[91:48.76]I think it's fine.
[91:51.38]It's the Kinect!
[92:00.12]It's not unwatchable!
[92:07.54]It's like 0.5 seconds behind.
[92:09.04]No, it's not.
[92:13.51]I'm done.
[92:13.97]I'm done.
[92:14.37]I'm done.
[92:14.71]We're just going.
[92:15.65]Everything's fine.
[92:26.60]There's nothing I can do to fix it because there is no fix.
[92:30.14]It's the connect.
[92:30.94]There's like a little quarter of a second delay.
[92:34.92]There's nothing I can do to fix it.
[92:36.44]It's 650, 650.
[92:37.39]If I change it, it fucks it up.
[92:38.93]Just relax.
[92:44.05]Okay, select continue to play or sign in.
[92:45.67]Okay.
[92:46.51]Raise hand.
[92:53.63]Welcome guest!
[92:57.70]Somebody's got fifty fucking dollars!
[93:00.62]Can you give us a good Expelliarmus?
[93:02.82]Oh, I'm gonna give you a good one.
[93:04.20]And that's another fifty dollars, and another fucking... That's... you're over a thousand dollars now.
[93:09.51]101,000 bits from Phylactery.
[93:12.92]Holy shit.
[93:16.30]You've crossed the $1,000 in the month mark.
[93:21.58]Wow.
[93:24.38]Thank you.
[93:25.12]For real.
[93:25.74]Alright, navigating menus.
[93:27.60]To move menus, skipping cinematics.
[93:29.42]Why would I skip the cutscenes in a Harry Potter game?
[93:31.86]That sounds like a mistake.
[93:35.95]Okay.
[93:36.17]Okay.
[93:37.95]To move menus to the left, hold your right hand out to the side and swipe to the left.
[93:42.53]I don't know these bullshit things.
[93:47.69]Okay, let's go.
[93:56.01]New game.
[94:00.58]For those who enjoy an easier experience, no.
[94:05.96]advanced for those who enjoy a challenge is it just normal with normal mode I'm not doing casual we're gonna do advanced harry potter was living oh
[94:27.61]I'm sorry, I just ruined it.
[94:28.55]With his awful Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, when, on his 11th birthday, he learned that he was a wizard and received a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
[94:43.34]Yeah, I've seen the movie.
[94:44.90]I don't know that owl's name.
[94:57.76]Fuck, I can't see from that far away.
[95:01.86]Dear Mr. Potter, we are pleased to inform that you have a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Inquisitory.
[95:06.80]Please find enclosed a list of all necessary books and equipment.
[95:10.85]Term begins on September 21st.
[95:13.09]Make sure you go to the carnival stream.
[95:15.59]We await your owl by no later than the 31st of July.
[95:20.15]Yours sincerely, Minerva McGonagall, Deputy Headmistress.
[95:27.18]Movie mode?
[95:31.10]Custom mode?
[95:35.84]What is that?
[95:36.34]What's the difference?
[95:36.94]Anybody know the difference?
[95:47.55]It just plays the movie?
[95:50.91]Custom mode.
[95:57.34]What's changing?
[95:59.54]This is empty.
[96:01.68]God, you know what I wish this was?
[96:11.33]I wish this was a fucking Skullcrusher IPA from Stone Cold Steve Austin.
[96:19.49]Taking a psycho.
[96:22.50]Move your head until it fills the head template.
[96:25.16]Sure thing.
[96:25.70]We gotta get my robe on.
[96:28.58]Stand in front of that mirror, please.
[96:31.10]That's it.
[96:32.26]Now position yourself so that your head fits the guide as closely as possible.
[96:37.21]Excellent.
[96:37.65]My face is too fucked up.
[96:38.49]Just one second, and we'll take a picture.
[96:40.61]Five, four, three, two, one.
[96:42.63]Looking good.
[96:48.19]Where are my eyes?
[96:49.21]Retake, retake, retake.
[96:50.01]I don't like that one.
[97:05.60]Now position yourself so that your head fits the guide as closely as possible.
[97:10.48]Excellent.
[97:10.90]Is it because I blinked?
[97:11.84]Just one second, and we'll take a picture.
[97:13.86]Five, four, three, two, one.
[97:19.80]Looking good.
[97:21.44]Now feel free to try a different look.
[97:23.99]Or if it's really not you, we can always take another picture.
[97:27.91]I need one more.
[97:30.80]That's it.
[97:31.94]Now position yourself so that your head fits the guide as closely as possible.
[97:36.88]Excellent.
[97:37.90]Just one second and we'll take a picture.
[97:40.27]Five, four, three, two, one.
[97:46.13]Looking good.
[97:47.75]Now feel free to try a different look.
[97:50.29]Or if it's really not you, we can always take another picture.
[97:55.49]What the fuck?
[97:58.75]Try a different look?
[98:11.01]oh my god that one that was the best go back to that one
[98:31.63]Where is it?
[98:33.19]There it is.
[98:38.23]Finished.
[98:39.63]Good luck.
[98:41.79]Bold as snort.
[98:42.29]The first thing every young witch or wizard must get before going to Hogwarts is a wand.
[98:48.63]Bold as snort.
[98:50.31]All right, we're going to get a wand.
[98:58.82]Trying a wand.
[98:59.58]Give a wand a try before moving your wand hand in a quick downward swishing motion.
[99:05.21]Okay.
[99:12.59]Ring the bell.
[99:14.07]Just a minute.
[99:17.57]Good afternoon.
[99:19.17]Hey.
[99:19.59]Welcome to Ollivander's.
[99:22.38]Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance.
[99:28.32]We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and dragon's heartstrings.
[99:34.96]No two Ollivander wands are the same.
[99:38.81]Just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same.
[99:45.65]And of course, you'll never get such good results with another wizard's wand.
[99:52.28]now let's get you a wand okay cherry and dragon heartstring nine inches very pliable don't want it give me something else apparently not I want
[100:18.72]Holly and Phoenix Feather, 11 inches.
[100:23.22]Nice and supple.
[100:24.56]Yeah, okay.
[100:26.26]I might like this one.
[100:27.16]Let's try this one.
[100:32.63]Well, there goes 200 years of history.
[100:34.39]We'll find the perfect match here somewhere.
[100:38.69]Elm and Unicorn Hair, 10 inches.
[100:42.87]Quite whippy.
[100:44.53]Try it.
[100:46.53]I want to pick my wand.
[100:47.89]I don't want him to tell me which wand is mine.
[100:49.97]Doesn't the wand pick the person?
[100:53.21]Tricky, customer.
[100:54.91]The wand picks the person, not the other way around.
[100:57.05]Try this one.
[100:58.67]You and Unicorn Head.
[101:01.19]Eight and three quarter inches.
[101:03.13]Powerful wand.
[101:05.19]Very powerful.
[101:06.47]This one has a good feel.
[101:17.30]Oh, bravo!
[101:19.26]Well, well, well.
[101:22.14]Curious indeed how these things happen.
[101:25.97]The wand chooses the wizard, remember?
[101:30.01]I think we must expect great things from you.
[101:36.36]I've already seen the movie.
[101:36.98]The moment first years arrive at Hogwarts, they are sorted into one of four houses.
[101:41.60]I better get Slytherin.
[101:42.73]Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, or Ravenclaw.
[101:47.01]I'm gonna be sitting there, I'm gonna be fucking just going, Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin, Slytherin!
[101:53.53]And the hat's gonna be like, Slytherin!
[101:58.11]Get sorted or try to influence the hat's decision, see?
[102:00.93]If you have a strong reference, say Gryffindor, Slytherin, or Ravenclaw to try to...
[102:16.18]Slytherin. Slytherin. Slytherin. Slytherin. Slytherin. Slytherin.
[102:22.66]Slytherin.
[102:23.32]Yes!
[102:51.43]Oh, he didn't drink.
[103:00.06]Alright, here we go.
[103:04.76]Advanced difficulty?
[103:09.65]Sorting hat.
[103:10.95]No, what?
[103:11.49]The sorting hat sleeps?
[103:16.35]Fox.
[103:16.99]What?
[103:19.11]What do I do?
[103:19.79]Do I...
[103:26.02]What am I doing?
[103:26.58]Am I, like, petting him?
[103:30.16]What if he just, like, bites my hand?
[103:44.85]Can I, like... Can we do anything else?
[103:54.92]I don't know.
[103:55.54]I don't know.
[104:01.35]Well, the memory pot.
[104:03.07]Let's do it.
[104:06.93]New potions class.
[104:08.37]Oh, yeah.
[104:08.73]Year one.
[104:09.15]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[104:10.57]I want to see what else is in the office.
[104:24.85]Sorting hat.
[104:25.33]Let's just see what happens.
[104:26.21]I wonder what happens.
[104:28.57]Year one song.
[104:30.25]Okay.
[104:30.41]Let's try it.
[104:32.61]Oh, you may not think I'm pretty, but don't judge on what you see.
[104:38.35]I'll eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me.
[104:43.57]People doing sour plays to that.
[104:51.88]Come on.
[105:00.01]Alright, here we go.
[105:01.24]Let's go in the memory box.
[105:03.28]This is advanced difficulty.
[105:05.74]Potion class, year one.
[105:06.86]Here we go.
[105:08.66]There's nothing, there hasn't been anything in here for 25 minutes.
[105:12.18]In your, I thought that, is that me?
[105:15.21]That looked like my face.
[105:16.23]That was my face in there.
[105:17.85]In your first potions class with Professor Snake, you will learn how to brew the cure for boils.
[105:22.61]I've done this before.
[105:24.94]Are you sure that's not my face?
[105:26.18]All first years are required to take potions class with Professor Snape.
[105:31.37]Snape is head of Slytherin House and seems to particularly dislike Harry Potter.
[105:38.09]Oh shit, I skipped it.
[105:39.55]How about you hand over an item to pick it up?
[105:43.40]Use the spoon to stir the cauldron in a circular motion until the potion is in the color shown in the instructions.
[105:55.73]Move an ingredient to the center of the cauldron.
[105:58.16]To add it, move the item away from the cauldron once you have added enough.
[106:02.02]Why am I only using one hand?
[106:06.18]Crush ingredients by moving the pestle in a clockwise or anti-clockwise motion.
[106:09.60]Why am I not using my left hand for anything?
[106:14.67]To put an ingredient down, raise your non-wand hand.
[106:18.55]Alright, let's go.
[106:24.68]You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of ocean making.
[106:31.00]I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, I can do better than that.
[106:37.73]If you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.
[106:41.87]I could have done better than that.
[106:45.05]I could have done much better than that.
[106:51.85]In today's class, you will attempt to brew a cure for boils.
[106:56.43]You may begin.
[107:00.64]Follow the instructions carefully.
[107:02.90]Be sure to stir the contents of your cauldron in the direction shown.
[107:13.43]Good.
[107:14.19]Once the potion reaches the color shown in the instructions... Don't touch it.
[107:19.17]Let go.
[107:21.87]Select ingredients by matching their colors and shapes with what is shown in your instrument.
[107:33.66]That is correct.
[107:34.60]Now pour until the potion is the required color.
[107:38.27]No more, no less.
[107:46.47]This should be simple.
[107:48.41]Find and add the correct ingredient.
[107:59.69]Oh, I don't think pineapple, but I don't think so.
[108:02.16]Fuck!
[108:03.20]By over-stirring or adding too much of an ingredient, try again.
[108:10.50]Some ingredients need crushing.
[108:13.52]Use your pestle and mortar.
[108:15.49]This is how I feel when I try to drive a manual car.
[108:20.33]I'm just like, I don't understand, so I don't want to do this.
[108:22.65]I'm not driving this.
[108:24.85]Okay, um, now what?
[108:26.39]Yellow one?
[108:41.69]Horned slugs.
[108:45.47]Horned slugs.
[108:46.99]I can... How is this advanced difficulty?
[108:50.85]Nope, not yet.
[108:51.43]Get back.
[108:52.25]Come on, let's throw it off.
[109:12.55]Uh-oh.
[109:13.91]I tried to cook my hand out of there.
[109:15.57]Your potion appears usable.
[109:19.13]Thank you.
[109:19.87]Well done.
[109:21.48]That was me being, I don't want to do this, the manual shift.
[109:33.58]I don't want to do, I don't want to learn the gear shift.
[109:39.38]I want a coaster here.
[109:40.26]The fucking Walmart desk is beautiful.
[109:46.07]Congratulations, you unlocked Charm's Clasp, Dumbledore's Office, and a cure for boils.
[109:56.72]Charm's Clasp, let's go.
[110:01.42]Cast the Levitating Charm.
[110:03.45]Wingardium Leviosa.
[110:05.91]I think I can handle it.
[110:07.99]When asked to say Wingardium Leviosa to make it your active spell,
[110:13.25]When asked, make Wingardium Leviosa your actor spell by holding your arms in its pose.
[110:18.82]No.
[110:19.40]You're all here.
[110:20.86]Today we'll start by learning how to make objects fly.
[110:24.60]To select which spell you're going to cast, you can simply say it.
[110:28.28]For today's class, the incantation is Wingardium Leviosa.
[110:33.52]Now, you try.
[110:34.68]Wingardium Leviosa.
[110:37.36]Wingardium Leviosa.
[110:39.43]Well done.
[110:40.68]Now, let me show you another way of selecting a spell.
[110:43.54]You could also use movement to select a spell.
[110:47.09]To select Wingardium Leviosa, put your arms in this position.
[110:50.93]Give it a go.
[111:06.49]Excellent.
[111:07.57]Now, once you've selected your spells, I speak to the incantation, or completing the arm movement, you can start to cast it with a wave of your wand.
[111:16.22]Like this.
[111:17.38]Wingardium Leviosa.
[111:20.24]Oh, he did to me.
[111:20.82]Wingardium Leviosa.
[111:21.56]Wingardium Leviosa.
[111:23.14]Wingardium Leviosa.
[111:26.60]Why are they sitting away from all the other people?
[111:30.46]My god, he fucks up too many spells.
[111:33.15]We gotta put him over here.
[111:33.99]Wingardium Leviosa!
[111:35.67]Wingardium Leviosa!
[111:49.64]Splendid job.
[111:51.40]You'll learn many more spells here at Hogwarts.
[111:54.15]Each has its own incantation.
[111:55.99]Didn't fucking like $200 come in like 10 minutes ago?
[111:59.67]Class dismissed.
[112:06.98]Hold on.
[112:07.62]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[112:08.90]You need to see that first.
[112:18.80]I don't like this shit recording me, man.
[112:22.52]Ah, but we had Lando Bando get $50.
[112:26.51]Holy shit.
[112:29.55]Dermot, I just want to say thanks for helping me and I'm sure a lot of other members of the community through hard times.
[112:33.47]Absolutely.
[112:35.53]You've helped me through mental hospital stays and major losses.
[112:38.77]You've definitely inspired me to work towards things that I actually want to do in my life.
[112:42.99]Also, I'm working on an animation for the teacher noise.
[112:45.03]I was wondering if you could make more student what the fuck background noises for me.
[112:48.38]Absolutely.
[112:49.78]Yeah.
[112:52.64]Here, ready?
[112:53.06]It's quiet.
[112:53.60]This will work.
[112:57.18]He's coming in.
[112:58.61]He's coming in here.
[112:59.49]Quiet, quiet, quiet.
[113:01.45]Do you see the new Smash Bros.
[113:02.65]character?
[113:03.55]Yeah, it was fucking so hard.
[113:05.63]It was the hardest game I've ever played.
[113:07.31]I couldn't beat... I couldn't get that level with Geno.
[113:09.57]It was really, really difficult for me.
[113:13.76]Ah!
[113:14.70]Kids don't scream like that.
[113:16.94]Use that.
[113:21.60]But no, seriously, Lando, thank you so much.
[113:23.55]That means a lot.
[113:27.28]If anybody gets anything from this channel, like I've said a thousand times, it means a lot.
[113:31.06]I hope you fucking like it.
[113:31.98]I hope you enjoy the content.
[113:32.96]I hope you like hanging out here, because that's... I wouldn't be here if I wasn't having fun, too.
[113:37.48]So, thank you, for real.
[113:39.64]And then, the Wild, again, the Wild, 50 bucks parter, parry harder, and the torturer's bone.
[113:56.41]Uh, thank you, GermaSucks, for the five dollars.
[113:59.87]No, five fucking community subs.
[114:05.20]Thank you, GermaSucks.
[114:24.78]Five dollars?
[114:25.28]No, that was way more than five dollars.
[114:27.17]Alright, troll battle.
[114:28.19]I'm ready.
[114:29.07]Imagine if that fucking... Imagine if I was, like, a boxer.
[114:32.89]Imagine if you got, like, fucking hit by one of those.
[114:39.07]Let's go.
[114:40.01]When Professor Quirrell interrupts dinner in the Great Hall to announce that there is a troll in the castle... No, not you!
[114:46.95]The boxer!
[114:47.91]...hermione may be in danger and go to the girl's toilets to rescue her.
[114:53.28]What?
[114:57.03]Jump to dodge the troll's low club swings.
[115:01.23]Duck to avoid the troll's high club swings.
[115:06.99]Throw objects by making an underarm or overarm throwing motion.
[115:12.80]If the troll grabs you, swipe your hand upwards to poke him with your wand.
[115:16.78]Like his neck?
[115:19.96]This is a lot of information.
[115:22.08]Cast Wingardium Leviosa with a quick downward swish of your wand arm with the aiming reticle.
[115:27.41]Up here is move your hand to aim at your target.
[115:29.33]Let's go.
[115:31.67]Let's kick his ass.
[115:36.59]I don't know why, but I thought that was two people just standing right there.
[115:51.20]Did he get me?
[115:57.32]Oh that's great!
[116:27.82]Oh, that was, like, instantly dead.
[116:29.92]I thought it was a duck!
[116:37.97]This, this is getting fucking destroyed!
[116:40.93]Wingardia Leviosa!
[116:49.65]Oh, I don't know!
[116:51.36]Oh, I'm just not sure!
[116:53.89]I just, I don't know what to do.
[116:54.96]There's a big troll in this room.
[116:56.26]I just can't tell what to do.
[116:57.46]I'm not sure.
[116:57.92]Skip.
[117:09.81]Let's go.
[117:10.35]Let's go.
[117:10.73]Let's go.
[117:11.49]Skip.
[117:18.11]Okay.
[117:19.40]Oh, boy.
[117:20.00]All right.
[117:20.24]This is...
[117:23.93]Hold on a second there, Mr. Troll.
[117:25.46]We can talk about this.
[117:38.22]You stop that right now.
[117:57.86]Why?
[117:58.62]What?
[118:06.12]Oh my, oh my goodness!
[118:27.13]Those ones are my friends!
[118:28.97]Oh, crochet!
[118:35.48]Oh, right ahead!
[118:41.58]He's gonna get me!
[119:20.66]Alright, now stick this, like, directly into his eye.
[119:23.62]What if he's just like... What if I... What if I do it?
[119:44.76]I'm hitting Harry in the face!
[119:48.26]Ron, you idiot!
[119:50.17]You keep stabbing me in my face and my eye hole!
[119:58.29]That was brutal!
[119:59.45]That was awful!
[120:02.96]Remember chance cards?
[120:04.38]Swish and Flick.
[120:05.68]Hit the Trolls Club with Wingardium Leviosa.
[120:08.22]Harry, I don't remember the name of the spell!
[120:12.80]It's something with a W!
[120:13.83]Wingardium Leviosa!
[120:18.19]Whoa, where'd we go?
[120:24.17]Wingardium Leviosa!
[120:26.88]Wingardium Leviosa!
[120:28.38]Wingardium Leviosa!
[120:30.14]Wingardium Leviosa!
[120:34.38]Wingardium Leviosa!
[120:38.42]He's gonna get hit right in the face by the ballad.
[120:40.74]Wingardium Leviosa!
[120:42.02]Who am I supposed to do this to?
[120:45.66]Wingardium Leviosa!
[120:47.68]Wingardium Leviosa!
[120:48.70]Wingardium! Wingardium! Wingardium! Wingardium! Wingardium! Wingardium! Wingardium! Wingardium! Wingardium! Wingardium! Wingardium! Wingardium! Wingardium! Wingardium! Wingardium! Wingardium! Wingardium! Wingardium!
[121:00.25]Got it.
[121:13.25]Phew.
[121:32.47]Quidditch match.
[121:33.28]Oh, I'm looking forward to this.
[121:40.08]When Professor McGonagall sees Harry catch something in midair while on his broomstick, she thinks that he could be perfect for the position of seeker on the Gryffindor Quidditch team.
[121:50.61]You fix your hair a lot.
[121:51.41]Prepare to play Harry's first match against Slither.
[121:54.43]Because it's unruly and fucking ugly and gross.
[121:57.29]And, like, I have to cut it, and it gets all in my face and in my mouth and shit.
[122:00.96]Like, I'm an irresponsible adult, and I should have cut my hair, like, three weeks ago.
[122:06.98]So it's Harry versus me.
[122:08.76]I'm on a...
[122:10.63]Lean left or right to steer your broom.
[122:12.43]Try to stay as close to the center of the snitch as possible.
[122:22.08]When tussling with your opponent, throw a punch or kick.
[122:28.89]They do that in Harry Potter?
[122:32.57]Hold your hand over the snitch to grab it.
[122:34.23]It's me.
[123:03.18]Harry did it too, it's okay.
[123:33.87]Every single option.
[123:36.39]It's alright.
[123:42.16]I can't see, guys.
[123:43.52]It's hard to see what I'm looking at.
[124:06.73]This is violent!
[124:12.22]Alright, Harry's gonna bloody nose at this point.
[124:20.08]Get outta here!
[124:51.59]What's the goal?
[124:54.25]Who's the thing?
[125:01.25]I've just beat up everybody on the whole team.
[125:09.83]Where is the Quidditch?
[125:11.46]Where is it?
[125:20.50]Got it!
[125:33.81]Not bad.
[125:35.31]Five stars.
[125:38.90]I'll take it.
[125:48.04]The Sorcerer's Stone.
[125:49.02]Do we go through all the movies?
[125:52.45]The Sorcerer's Stone can produce the elixir of life, which makes the drinker immortal.
[125:58.75]To keep it safe, Dumbledore has hidden the stone in Hogwarts under Harry protection.
[126:04.35]When Harry, Ron, and Hermione realize Voldemort has discovered the stone's location, they go to find it before he can get to it.
[126:15.89]Boss fight incoming.
[126:18.65]Block incoming keys with your hands.
[126:22.63]When chasing the door key, hold your hand over it to grab it.
[126:28.34]Touch Voldemort's face with both hands to fight him off.
[126:33.12]What?
[126:33.32]I have to like push Voldemort's face?
[126:43.44]What are we going to do?
[126:44.42]There must be a thousand keys up there.
[126:46.50]We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one.
[126:48.62]Probably rusty like the handle.
[126:50.10]Go on.
[126:50.80]Maybe I can catch one out with a broomstick you can.
[126:54.23]Watch out!
[126:58.35]Hit those keys away!
[127:33.07]Grab the right key.
[127:35.25]Which one is it?
[127:36.39]Uh oh, shit, I'm free life.
[127:41.45]Just let it hit me in the face.
[127:49.71]It'll block it.
[128:00.48]Where's the real one?
[128:01.36]Why am I just... Whatever.
[128:16.53]I gotta concentrate here.
[128:25.48]Just let him hit me.
[128:27.06]Let the mosquitoes bite me.
[128:28.48]I don't care.
[128:34.41]That's the key!
[128:35.43]Grab it!
[128:35.86]What?
[128:38.12]Got it!
[128:49.38]That's it!
[128:50.80]You've got it!
[128:52.02]Never mind, you catch!
[128:54.78]Who's next?
[128:56.68]Voldemort, right?
[128:57.34]Hurry up!
[128:59.02]Oh, sure, I said his name.
[129:03.44]That was close.
[129:11.37]We meet again.
[129:12.49]See what I must do to survive?
[129:15.05]Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own.
[129:20.97]There is something that can, something that conveniently enough lies in your pocket.
[129:27.45]Stop him!
[129:35.48]Get out of there!
[129:39.50]I cannot hold him!
[129:45.40]Get off of me!
[129:47.04]This touch burns!
[129:50.80]I can't.
[129:51.66]This is... No!
[129:55.80]Ah!
[130:05.69]attempts remaining a hundred you can attempt that a hundred times
[130:40.26]That seems a little overkill.
[130:44.44]Year one, I did it.
[130:49.94]Harry Potter year one, year two coming up.
[130:54.97]Wait, okay, yeah.
[130:58.27]Do we actually play through?
[130:59.14]How many movies are out by this point?
[131:00.04]Having defeated Voldemort, Harry recovers from the confrontation in the hospital wing.
[131:05.48]Dumbledore visits him and tells him that the stone has indeed been destroyed.
[131:11.34]The year ends with Gryffindor winning the House Cup.
[131:20.01]This shit definitely didn't come out before the last movie did.
[131:40.34]Year two, bring it on.
[131:44.00]God, I wish I just, I wish I had a nice cold Skull Crusher IPA Stone Cold Steve Austin beer.
[131:56.00]Professor Lockhart, the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher during Harry's second year at Hogwarts, releases a number of Cornish pixies into his classroom.
[132:06.67]The students must get them back into their cage.
[132:09.93]The last movie was 2011?
[132:11.17]Oh, this came out in 2012?
[132:18.58]Quickly swipe your hand to generate a trail.
[132:20.58]The trail will hit anything it touches.
[132:24.97]Say, Hermione!
[132:26.65]Or raise your non-wan hand for help.
[132:30.88]Just pop them back into their cage.
[132:33.02]Pesky pixies!
[132:37.22]Try giving them a good whack.
[132:38.80]It should send them off for a while.
[132:43.20]Hermione!
[132:46.66]Hermione!
[132:55.67]Hermione!
[132:58.24]Hermione!
[133:00.10]Help!
[133:00.74]Quick!
[133:01.66]Get those pixies off him!
[133:03.42]You alright?
[133:07.28]Now what do they have?
[133:15.19]Watch out for those potions.
[133:19.19]They could be dangerous.
[133:22.74]Shit!
[133:26.79]Dammit, fruit ninja.
[133:29.49]Come on, Ape!
[133:30.79]Your turn.
[134:09.56]Second year is way harder than first year.
[134:32.00]He's got two broken shins!
[134:34.40]Mandrake repotting.
[134:50.89]The second years in Professor Sprout's herbology class must repot seedling mandrakes.
[134:56.85]Be careful to wear earmuffs as the cry of the seedlings will knock out a human for several hours.
[135:03.57]Do I have to block my ears?
[135:05.92]When prompted, move your hands to your ears to put on your earmuffs.
[135:11.08]Lean left or right to move along the mandrake table.
[135:13.88]Am I a mandrake?
[135:16.08]Move your hand over an unhappy mandrake to grab it.
[135:21.15]Shake a mandrake to pull it from its pot.
[135:25.97]Hold a mandrake over an empty pot.
[135:29.04]Raise your hand to switch to holding your watering can.
[135:33.08]Raise your other hand to switch to holding slug repellent.
[135:36.83]Lower your hand to pour water of slug repellent.
[135:42.55]Sounds easy.
[135:43.14]Welcome to greenhouse three, second years.
[135:46.20]Our mandrakes are only seedlings, but their cry could still knock you out for several hours.
[135:52.37]Please put on your earmuffs for your auditory protection.
[136:04.98]Now, we'll start by repotting.
[136:06.95]Look out for unhappy mandrakes.
[136:08.93]They are the ones that have outgrown the- That's it!
[136:11.67]Grasp your mandrake securely and give it a- Now, place him down into another empty pot.
[136:16.97]Uh, uh, where's another empty pot?
[136:19.96]I don't know where one is.
[136:20.96]Where's another empty pot?
[136:23.10]Where do I go?
[136:23.50]Over this way?
[136:25.36]How do I- How do I move?
[136:28.34]How do I move to another pot?
[136:29.90]How do I move?
[136:30.74]I don't know what to do!
[136:34.33]How do I... Oh, lean.
[136:36.75]Okay.
[136:37.19]I'm trying to put him in.
[136:42.34]Oh, this is fucking terrible.
[136:45.36]Okay.
[136:45.60]Now?
[137:35.19]Got one!
[137:37.57]Alright, that's it, I got her!
[137:45.89]Alright, I'm gonna get my watering can.
[138:07.63]Who's agitated right here Who's that anymore when the head is done
[138:52.82]I only have 16 seconds.
[138:55.18]Right there.
[138:56.46]Come on!
[138:59.83]I can't go any further over!
[139:25.93]Why am I, why am I blacking out?
[139:27.85]I just, I just, like, knocked out Neville.
[139:30.28]Let's do it again.
[139:31.26]Okay, let's go.
[139:49.93]I fucking destroyed it.
[139:51.59]Here we go.
[139:52.39]I got it.
[139:52.79]I know what to do now.
[139:53.83]Let's go.
[139:54.31]All right.
[139:54.73]I want to get this knocked out of the park.
[140:00.73]I want to fuck this up again.
[140:02.55]Let's go.
[140:03.05]Get this one done quick.
[140:21.72]Right in the middle.
[140:24.42]We're going to the next spot right next to it.
[140:26.10]I'm trying to go quick.
[140:34.94]Last one.
[140:36.50]Come on, get over here.
[140:56.05]Who's the bad guy in the second movie?
[140:58.73]Who's the bad guy in the second movie?
[141:01.11]Alright, here we go.
[141:01.76]Use the cannon.
[141:02.56]This is it.
[141:02.96]Don't fuck this up this time.
[141:03.90]This takes too long.
[141:04.58]Slow down.
[141:25.61]Agitated.
[141:26.21]Agitated, right here.
[141:30.55]These two.
[141:30.91]Right here.
[141:55.08]We're at the end?
[142:03.56]Who needs it?
[142:06.36]I have 17 seconds remaining, who needs this?
[142:12.15]There's nobody left!
[142:13.95]There's nobody left that needs water!
[142:15.67]I swear to god there's nobody that needs water!
[142:20.25]Who needs the water?
[142:24.13]I have to pull him out?
[142:26.39]I thought I was just supposed to- what are these-
[142:57.64]Welcome to greenhouse three, second years.
[143:00.68]Our mandrakes are... Now, we'll start by repotting.
[143:10.01]Look out for unhappy mandrakes.
[143:12.13]Now, that's it.
[143:13.25]Grasp your mandrake secure... Now, place him down into another empty pot.
[143:24.57]Come on.
[143:51.97]Okay.
[143:52.31]Let's go.
[143:53.25]Give me the can.
[143:54.69]Who's crying?
[143:55.69]No, you...
[144:22.09]Come here!
[144:34.49]Who's crying?
[144:39.82]Who's crying?
[144:50.69]Double, double, I got triple right here.
[144:52.15]Come here.
[144:53.11]You!
[145:33.61]Good.
[145:34.21]Oh, thank God.
[145:35.51]I think it's time to give you some advanced mandrake maintenance.
[145:39.80]Oh, no, it's around three.
[145:41.24]Flesh-eating slugs are harmful to men.
[145:44.72]Be sure to apply repellent at the first signs of an infestation.
[145:51.60]Who is doing this?
[145:53.18]Oh, they're killing him!
[145:59.44]Slugs, where is he?
[146:27.30]You fucking idiot.
[146:56.71]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going!
[147:31.98]Well, you're quite the expert.
[147:33.98]With Mandrake care like that, I'm quite sure we should expect a real bumper harvest.
[147:39.34]That was really, really hard.
[147:41.05]That was not easy.
[147:42.15]You see me go back to the toilet.
[147:52.22]All right.
[147:53.62]I did it.
[148:01.22]I'm ready.
[148:03.74]Dueling Club.
[148:04.60]This is what I bought this game for.
[148:06.02]This is why I purchased this.
[148:07.24]Not me.
[148:07.72]I thought, what about me?
[148:08.48]It's supposed to be me.
[148:09.42]Step to the left or right to move.
[148:10.68]Yep, Dueling Club.
[148:31.63]Hold both hands in front of you to cast Protogo.
[148:36.59]Cast a spell with a quick downward switch of your wand arm.
[148:39.10]When the aiming reticle appears, move your hand and aim at your target.
[148:42.00]Okay.
[148:48.66]Call out a spell's incantation or hold its pose to change your active spell.
[148:53.56]This is a Leonardo da Vinci thing.
[148:56.16]What's it called, like the wheel man?
[148:59.76]Let's go.
[149:02.65]Ones at the ready.
[149:07.43]On the count of three.
[149:09.05]I don't remember the controls.
[149:09.99]One, two, three.
[149:11.63]Ow.
[149:21.26]Block.
[149:33.84]How do I- What's the one- What's the one that kills people?
[149:38.90]What's the one that- What's the one that kills people?
[149:41.06]Ah, it- What's it called?
[149:44.07]What's it called?
[149:44.51]What's it called?
[149:46.49]The Forbidden One!
[149:50.75]What's it called?
[149:52.51]A- A- A- What is it?
[150:04.00]Adavacadabra?
[150:05.92]Adavacadabra.
[150:12.03]Adavacadabra.
[150:13.33]Wait.
[150:13.79]Shit.
[150:14.09]What am I doing?
[150:37.41]on any time!
[151:07.36]I can go rapid fire with that shit.
[151:42.36]Ones at the ready.
[151:44.76]I'm gonna light a bomb, watch this.
[151:47.14]On the count of three.
[151:50.11]One, two, three!
[151:57.03]He's blocking!
[152:04.44]He's...
[152:11.40]He's just, he's just deflecting them.
[152:15.98]Wait, what do I do against the fucking guy that has rapid fire?
[152:18.98]Hold up the shield.
[152:31.37]I don't, how do I block attacks?
[152:33.05]How do I block them?
[152:39.14]One, two, three!
[152:44.90]What's he saying?
[152:54.93]What is that?
[152:55.29]Where did he do this?
[153:08.65]Cast Protego!
[153:09.07]Oh shit!
[153:09.29]Okay.
[153:34.50]This dude sucks.
[154:30.66]If you were any slower, you'd be gone.
[155:06.85]That was a double knockout.
[155:08.35]That was a double knockout.
[155:15.72]Ones at the ready.
[155:20.48]On the count of three.
[155:23.42]One, two, three.
[155:27.81]All right, I'm ready.
[156:55.71]Slytherin, win!
[157:10.67]I want, I want to do like the, this thing.
[157:15.04]The
[157:23.46]Dead.
[157:23.76]Going through all seven buttonholes.
[157:25.06]Can't hide.
[157:25.34]Here we go.
[157:25.68]Dodge.
[157:56.33]Dodging the basilisk at the last second will cause him to stun himself momentarily.
[158:00.55]Once he is stunned, swipe him with your wand hand to damage him.
[158:03.45]I got a sword this one.
[158:06.45]She's still alive, but only just.
[158:10.00]You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger.
[158:15.48]Here we go.
[158:22.77]It only obeys me.
[158:29.38]I'm gonna drink my coke.
[158:35.60]That was bad.
[158:36.28]It was supposed to be the snake.
[158:47.90]You can see the... You can see the... No, no, no, no, no.
[158:57.90]Come on.
[159:01.36]Harry learns that Ginny Weasley has been taken- All right, so we gotta dodge, dodge, and then slash.
[159:07.87]You got it.
[159:12.61]What's on me?
[159:17.05]She's still alive, but only just.
[159:20.61]You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger.
[159:33.38]It only obeys you.
[160:09.19]I was gonna say, how long is this hallway?
[160:13.76]Oh, it's the shoulder of Gryffindor!
[160:17.30]No!
[160:19.14]The bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you!
[160:22.80]Uh-oh.
[160:23.12]I see it.
[160:52.60]What the fuck?
[160:55.51]She's still alive.
[160:57.39]But only just.
[160:59.06]You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger.
[161:35.68]Here we go.
[161:36.73]I'm dodging.
[161:37.37]How am I not dodging it?
[162:09.86]This is gonna take forever!
[162:34.65]It's just like Punch-Up.
[162:47.85]I just hurt my back!
[162:48.69]Why is the sword in me?
[162:50.65]Why is the sword in me?
[162:51.67]Did I stab myself in the side?
[162:52.83]I thought I had the sword in me.
[163:27.01]Look at that.
[163:27.46]Look at the movements.
[163:29.38]I can move.
[163:29.92]34 years old.
[163:30.92]Year three.
[163:54.14]After Harry defeats Tom Riddle by destroying the diary and saves Ginny, Dumbledore tells him that only a true Gryffindor would have pulled the sword out of a sorting hat.
[164:07.07]I want to do the laser.
[164:08.73]That's why I bought this.
[164:20.66]When does that happen?
[164:21.98]Which movie?
[164:27.60]That's This Is It.
[164:28.96]It's this one.
[164:32.22]It's the fourth movie.
[164:34.93]Really?
[164:36.99]Harry, Ron, and Hermione are returning to Hogwarts Castle when Scabbers escapes from Ron's grasp.
[164:44.21]Just as Ron reaches Scabbers, near the thumping willow, a large black dog grabs Ron and drags him into a passageway in the tree's trunk.
[164:54.04]Harry and Hermione must avoid the tree's branches to reach their friend.
[164:59.28]Beat the game.
[165:06.45]I actually kind of like Jump, Low, Swinging, Branches.
[165:11.57]Duck High.
[165:12.13]Okay, Duck, Jump, and Dodge.
[165:16.16]I just want to do the part where he was like this.
[165:18.26]The next one's very relaxing.
[165:54.18]Well, it got much harder, that's for sure.
[165:56.26]Run!
[165:58.48]Run!
[165:58.84]Get off me!
[166:43.53]Oh, what a big tree!
[166:44.57]He's so scary!
[166:48.14]Oops!
[166:50.70]You missed!
[166:56.60]Oh no!
[167:34.58]I hate this.
[167:35.86]But I have to do it.
[167:44.70]I don't hear anything.
[168:04.80]My wireless setup.
[168:06.52]Oh, I gotta pee so bad.
[168:12.84]Oh, shit.
[168:15.46]Come on, let's make this quick.
[168:24.67]Whoa, you almost got me.
[168:26.17]Shit.
[168:26.49]Okay, come on.
[168:27.07]Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go.
[168:29.81]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[169:08.67]The sound of losing steam on this one.
[169:59.26]I have to do this again?
[170:41.86]Pee pants park.
[170:46.37]That was no joke.
[170:55.45]Oh, that's right.
[170:55.91]It is advanced.
[170:58.36]Why did I do this?
[170:59.90]If you've never seen Harry Potter before, this is every single fucking movie.
[171:07.87]They're telling you everything that happens.
[171:11.29]Everything.
[171:12.03]You are getting every spoiler of all seven movies.
[171:14.27]So if you're planning on watching them,
[171:28.38]You came to the wrong string.
[171:31.38]Okay, leaning and turning.
[171:34.34]Leaning, hitting scabbers.
[171:38.32]Let's get this one done quick.
[171:41.41]I've waited a long time for this moment.
[171:44.10]12 years in Azkaban.
[171:48.68]You see, I didn't betray your parents.
[171:51.32]It was someone else.
[171:52.80]Peter Pettigrew.
[171:54.35]And he's in this room right now.
[171:55.85]Scuppers!
[172:13.11]I'll get him.
[172:13.47]First shot.
[172:13.89]The sofa!
[172:14.27]Just whack-a-mole.
[172:14.91]Don't hurt him!
[172:43.27]he's quick you need to be quicker you can't get away pettigrew everybody see one he's getting away he's gone skippers no where is he
[173:15.34]I didn't do any of that.
[173:17.44]It's still doing the I have to pee thing from last time.
[173:28.27]Alright, here we go.
[173:29.15]Sofa.
[173:29.25]Got it.
[173:56.41]Wait!
[174:03.34]Where is he?
[174:05.82]Got it.
[174:12.34]Got it, got it, got it!
[174:17.49]Nice one, James!
[174:20.95]Don't escape, Pettigrew!
[174:28.41]Oh, here we go!
[174:37.92]Three dozen.
[174:45.80]Skaggles!
[174:47.56]Alright, team.
[174:50.37]I'm looking at a 27 inch screen from across the whole room.
[175:02.88]I don't have like a big projector.
[175:14.33]I've waited a long time for this moment.
[175:17.01]12 years in Azkaban.
[175:21.59]You see, I didn't betray your parents.
[175:24.23]It was somebody else.
[175:24.91]Somebody else did.
[175:28.12]Take the fireplace.
[175:29.04]I've waited 12 years for this.
[175:34.90]Come on.
[175:39.72]I can't see.
[175:40.70]Everything's gray.
[175:52.77]I'm making everybody sick, I think.
[176:02.24]It's making me sick!
[176:23.31]second I have to stop.
[176:24.77]But I can't because I don't want to lose.
[176:29.57]Everybody close your eyes until it's done.
[176:34.67]I'll tell you when you can open your eyes.
[176:51.46]Open your eyes!
[176:52.80]That one was impossible.
[176:59.28]Without the secret technique.
[177:21.88]Don't do it with that hand.
[177:25.24]I'm going like this.
[177:26.24]Hold the wand.
[177:27.28]I'm going like that.
[177:29.30]It's not a big deal.
[177:33.53]The Battle of the Dementors.
[177:38.57]Oh man, here we go.
[177:41.03]This is what I'm talking about.
[177:42.07]This is what we do with the dueling wands.
[177:43.95]After capturing Peter Pettigrew, the group leave the Shrieking Shack.
[177:48.81]But Professor Lupin has forgotten to take his wolfsbane potion and turns into a werewolf.
[177:54.48]I'm starting to sweat.
[177:55.54]In the ensuing mayhem, Pettigrew transforms back into a rat and escapes.
[178:01.00]Sirius chases Lupin and is injured.
[178:03.48]Okay, move your wand hand to control your Patronus.
[178:08.97]Move it in front of incoming Dementors to repel them.
[178:13.29]Alright.
[178:17.44]Lean left and right to block the Dementors path.
[178:24.72]So block with the blonde, block with my body.
[178:36.13]Body block and arm block.
[178:49.43]Whoa, shit!
[178:51.35]This one's kind of fun.
[179:04.99]Because it's cool.
[179:21.04]What's going on?
[179:31.19]Did he take a portion of my soul?
[179:34.86]No, he took my life essence.
[179:37.72]Alright, just block.
[179:53.99]It's going to get harder and harder, isn't it?
[180:05.67]Ow!
[180:19.91]It's just like House of the Dead.
[180:21.63]They make it so you can't get two or three people to come to the screen at the same time unless you have two players.
[181:06.32]Are you serious?
[181:39.85]you
[182:10.67]One more.
[182:18.80]I am...
[182:59.92]Let's go.
[183:18.81]Don't take any damage until the last phase.
[183:21.23]Unnecessary damage.
[184:08.34]Alright, this one was really hard last time.
[184:40.05]Alright, let's go.
[184:41.76]What do you practice?
[185:31.42]I was here.
[185:32.88]I was here.
[185:37.44]Two.
[185:37.52]I got the achievement unlock.
[185:39.30]Two.
[186:02.23]Oh, it's a perfect score, that's why.
[186:10.95]That was year three?!
[186:15.60]That was it?
[186:16.64]That movie sucked.
[186:18.22]What a boring fucking movie.
[186:23.62]At Dumbledore's suggestion, Harry and Hermione used the Time Turner to go back and save Buckbeak, and learn that it was actually Harry who defeated the Dementors and saved Sirius, not Harry's father, as he'd thought.
[186:40.57]Year four is the Triwizard Tournament.
[186:43.51]This is when you get to do this thing.
[186:46.21]That's all I care about, then we can move on to the relaxing game.
[186:53.83]When Harry is mysteriously entered into the Triwizard Tournament, he must first obtain a golden egg from the clutches of a Hungarian horn-tailed dragon.
[187:04.73]From the egg, he learns that the second task will be in the lake.
[187:08.45]Breathe underwater and recover something that has been lost.
[187:11.85]Swim!
[187:12.25]Okay.
[187:14.73]So you swim.
[187:17.51]Cast spells at the Gwyndolos with a quick swish of your wand hand.
[187:22.84]and dodge the Gwindelwoes by sidestepping.
[187:25.90]All right, so swim slash sidestep.
[188:18.16]This movie's not very good.
[188:19.16]What did I do?
[188:44.63]Give me the thing, I don't want to do this like three times.
[188:54.16]Come on, quick!
[189:04.66]Of course I gotta do this like three times.
[189:39.74]Alright, prepared?
[189:44.76]They're getting, they're getting more aggressive.
[189:47.79]I'm just gonna start, like, jumping.
[189:51.87]I just jumped into that.
[189:53.45]That's how far I can move.
[189:56.08]One, two, three, go.
[189:57.00]All the way.
[190:20.10]Why do they keep playing the Avengers theme song?
[190:41.60]Alright, da-da-da-da-da-da-da!
[191:03.02]Avengers, assemble!
[191:05.04]Anything else?
[191:22.24]Stellar swimmer.
[191:28.59]Third task, and then we have to fight... What's his name?
[191:31.85]For the third task of the Triwizard Tournament, Harry must avoid obstacles as he races through a maze against Cedric Diggory and the other Triwizard champions in an effort to be the first to reach... I'm very bad at mazes.
[191:46.47]Jump to dodge the maze's low obstacles.
[191:49.07]Duck and shit.
[191:50.41]Duck, jump.
[191:53.27]This is going to be terrible.
[191:54.75]I don't want to do any more jumping.
[192:05.60]I've been jumping for three hours, four hours.
[192:07.60]Oh my god, this is bad.
[192:16.15]I can't even see them.
[192:17.95]I can't see them guys.
[192:44.94]How the fuck are you supposed to do that?
[192:47.48]How are you supposed to do that?
[192:48.64]That was impossible.
[193:01.50]I just need to get to the thing and then we can go to the relaxing game.
[193:22.61]I'm trying to cheat it.
[193:28.95]Alright, last coming phase here.
[193:35.09]Phase 3.
[194:26.83]All right, that's it!
[194:28.27]That's it, come on, that's it.
[194:29.47]I don't wanna do this again, just concentrate.
[195:05.77]Relax, Jeremy.
[195:06.41]It's not a game, eh?
[195:09.27]Go!
[195:25.32]He's... He's fucking me up.
[195:41.82]Give it to me!
[195:43.20]Together.
[195:44.56]One, two, three!
[196:00.33]There's a big spoiler coming up.
[196:03.11]Quick, get out of here, get out of here!
[196:04.28]Leave, now, quick!
[196:07.12]You had your chance.
[196:11.63]Unbeknownst to Harry and Cedric, the Triwizard Cup is a portkey that takes them to a graveyard where they encounter Peter Pan- Let's go.
[196:23.16]During the wand connection, raise and lower your hand to move your cast up and down.
[196:28.96]Try to match the height of Voldemort's cast.
[196:31.86]This is the thing?
[196:32.54]This is the thing?
[196:33.74]This thing?
[196:41.29]Don't you turn your back on me!
[196:46.95]I want you to look at me!
[197:12.16]I want to see the light!
[197:13.48]Leave your eyes!
[197:15.36]Here we go!
[197:20.46]She won't stop!
[197:25.98]Incentivo!
[197:32.95]Incentivo!
[198:10.61]I can't do it!
[198:50.82]I just like jolted my neck.
[199:00.45]You can't block it.
[199:24.24]Don't you turn your back on me.
[199:26.67]I want you to look at me.
[199:28.47]Let's go.
[199:29.35]I want to see the light.
[199:30.67]Leave your eyes.
[199:32.69]You've lit me.
[199:40.77]You've lit me with the kill thing.
[199:54.88]I ain't fuckin' around now.
[199:56.60]Don't you turn your back on me!
[199:59.02]I want you to look at me!
[200:01.63]Crucia!
[200:02.21]Protect her!
[200:08.09]Protect her!
[200:10.57]Crucia!
[200:14.32]Oh!
[200:14.58]I made it, Kenneth!
[200:47.52]Incentive Crucial!
[200:50.91]Crucial!
[200:56.20]Incentive Crucial!
[201:17.88]They never learn.
[201:19.91]Touch!
[201:51.22]What happened?
[201:55.56]This shit is fucking hard.
[201:57.24]This is hard.
[201:58.66]This is hard in advance.
[201:59.94]The kids didn't pick this, only I did.
[202:02.99]I have to beat Voldemort, otherwise I can't move on.
[202:06.85]I gotta catch him.
[202:08.25]In like a rapid fire, like sicko move, like this one.
[202:10.59]Here we go.
[202:13.46]I
[203:22.68]Don't you turn your back on... Protego!
[203:51.35]Get over here and start strangling him!
[203:53.49]Hurry!
[204:16.44]Get over there!
[204:17.44]It's pretty hands-free, isn't it?
[204:20.26]Extremely unethical!
[204:21.54]Insane!
[205:09.56]It's possible.
[205:10.72]It's not possible.
[205:12.15]It's not possible.
[205:13.51]It's impossible.
[205:14.57]It's not possible.
[205:15.39]They were designed to be in the community.
[205:23.53]I have to cheese ball it.
[205:27.99]Here we go.
[205:32.07]Don't you turn your back on Protagon.
[206:03.90]Better.
[206:04.34]You gotta get to the point where he lands on the ground and then rapid fire.
[206:16.00]Oh fuck, that's the thing!
[206:35.43]It's supposed to be casted I
[207:04.44]No!
[207:04.70]Come on, Dad!
[207:06.08]Dad!
[207:30.04]My arm!
[207:30.69]How did they hold their arms up for this long?
[207:46.29]Do it!
[207:48.17]Akio!
[208:11.39]Motherfucker.
[208:17.70]How many more years are there?
[208:23.95]Should I just do it?
[208:25.09]No, I'm not gonna do it.
[208:26.17]Nah, that's all I wanna do.
[208:28.27]I'm done.
[208:28.89]We're moving on.
[208:29.33]We're doing the fucking relaxing game.
[208:34.74]I'm moving off to the relaxing end.
[208:37.74]I'm probably gonna get sued for this one too, by the way.
[208:39.46]I don't know what the... I don't know if this is... I'm not sure if this is legal.
[208:43.34]This is what I'm trying to say.
[208:45.20]When Harry's wand and Voldemort's connected, an effect known as Priory Incantatum occurred, giving Harry time to summon the portkey and return to Hogwarts.
[208:56.57]That's not so fun to see what the level is.
[208:58.47]Room of Requirement.
[209:03.42]Alright, we're gonna, uh, alright, let me see what it is.
[209:05.76]Improve your defense against the dark arts skills in the room of r- no.
[209:14.26]No, no, we'll go back to it.
[209:15.68]Feeling, yeah, I am feeling tired.
[209:18.13]Thank you, Xbox.
[209:19.27]Let's, let's relax.
[209:20.27]I might go back to this one in a little bit.
[209:25.61]What the hell?
[209:29.49]Alright, um, this one, this is a relaxing one.
[209:31.55]This is just chill.
[209:33.78]This is for us to just hang out.
[209:35.10]This is not going to be crazy.
[209:37.00]This is going to get my whole channel clanked.
[209:40.99]Open the fucking disk tray.
[209:46.85]This disk is very, like, so hot that I could probably burn my... If I lifted up my shirt right now and went like this, it would leave a ring.
[209:57.93]It would burn my skin.
[210:03.06]Alright, let's relax.
[210:05.45]Let's relax and get fucking sued.
[210:30.44]Update.
[210:30.68]Update.
[210:32.32]Look at my sweaty ass hair.
[210:35.48]Holy shit.

[225:39.57]Hey, this is it.
[225:42.13]Gotta get it.
[225:43.01]Don't panic.
[225:43.91]Put your hand up, any hand, and take it.
[225:46.97]I can't reach that.
[225:49.07]I can't.
[225:52.83]What do you mean, grab it and take it?
[225:55.69]This is cruel.

[226:13.86]How do I do the picture?
[226:22.82]Did you forget what you were going to say?
[226:30.33]How do you take the picture?
[226:31.11]Hold out your arm to take a photo.
[227:11.14]When your hands pull, you have to use the other one to move around.
[227:14.48]Like the genie, you need your freedom.
[227:22.23]Can you do this for me?
[227:23.83]Because I can't... I can't seem to figure it out.
[227:37.22]Gosh, sure is a nice day.
[227:39.54]The fuck did you say?
[227:40.94]Okay.

[227:57.28]I thought I was supposed to do it.
[228:01.56]You got it.
[228:03.12]You'll be a pro with that camera in no time.
[228:06.36]That's one for the album.
[228:09.34]I've given you a few albums to get started with, but I know there's more out there.
[228:13.80]Maybe we can get them from the shops.
[228:19.57]Come on, you broke ass game.
[228:26.71]I'm ready when you are.

[228:48.80]Just call them on the phone.
[228:50.44]We have a Mickey cell phone.
[228:51.84]They sell it at fucking Walmart.
[228:53.26]I know you have one.
[228:53.94]Okay.
[228:54.04]Give me an autograph, too.
[228:54.72]I want more.
[229:14.15]You know what's a really, really good skill?
[229:21.01]Those Disney actors in that suit with the big oven mitt gloves that can actually write cursive like that.
[229:29.50]Oh, okay.
[229:32.68]He took my pen.
[229:38.94]I'm getting a lot of personal time with Mickey.
[229:42.40]This kid's been waiting in line for so long.
[229:45.54]There's a kid sitting there for like 20 minutes while we do all kinds of dance routines.
[229:53.51]That kid's like, can I please have a turn?
[229:56.69]No, you can't.
[230:01.73]I gotta figure out how to use this camera.
[230:03.29]Where'd it go?
[230:13.67]Alright, get Goofy's picture.
[230:14.93]Goofy's picture.
[230:16.03]Somebody look it up.
[230:16.71]How do I take a picture with a fucking cellphone?
[230:48.64]Where are you taking me?
[230:58.13]You can ignore the story and go for a ride.
[231:00.21]I can?
[231:00.60]Can I go for a ride?
[231:03.56]Alright, let's go for a ride.
[231:04.38]Fuck, who cares about taking pictures of Goofy and Donald and shit.
[231:07.02]Let's go.
[231:07.36]I can just go for a ride?
[231:10.54]Let's go.
[231:17.68]Okay, there it is.
[231:18.72]There it is up there.
[231:21.62]That's the Magic Castle.
[231:23.08]Splash Mountain.
[231:31.47]We're going to Splash Mountain.
[231:32.63]Splash Mountain.
[231:51.04]Don't do that.
[231:51.68]Don't do that again.
[231:56.30]I'm documenting everything.
[231:57.54]What ride should I go on?
[232:02.21]Splash Mountain.
[232:03.23]Who cares about anything else but Splash Mountain?
[232:05.59]Wait, wait, wait, wait, what?
[232:06.55]Take your arm out to take a photo?
[232:23.58]Did I take it?
[232:27.86]Take photo!
[232:40.95]Take the picture!
[232:41.98]I just can't, I...
[232:58.42]Alright, there it is.
[233:02.52]I can't wait.
[233:03.20]This is all I care about.
[233:06.21]Is just getting on that Splash Mountain ride.
[233:08.21]Nothing else matters.
[233:08.91]There's a line.
[233:14.63]Xbox!
[233:29.62]Fast travel!
[233:34.06]Splash Mountain!
[233:35.68]I'm already here.
[233:41.31]Where's the line to get on this?
[233:44.25]I think Belle is the one who could break the spell.
[233:50.71]If only I knew how she felt.
[233:55.67]Uh-uh, won't work yet.
[233:57.07]Gotta go get the right album first.
[233:59.41]I saw some in the shops.
[234:00.75]Go get one.
[234:02.59]Oh, shut up.
[234:05.19]All right, get away from Beast.
[234:14.37]There it is.
[234:14.71]It's the line.
[234:15.95]Just cut everybody in line.
[234:19.89]Well, ball me up and throw me away.
[234:22.15]Will you look at that?
[234:23.73]Want to see where it goes?
[234:26.88]Yeah, that's a- there we go, this is a ride.
[234:31.78]The bu- the- is this it?
[234:36.24]We actually get to do something, holy shit.
[234:49.81]Why am I on drugs?
[234:59.25]Turn left, lean left and right to avoid bumping into things.
[235:06.17]Is this a ride at actual Disneyland?
[235:14.94]I still get to ride Splash Mountain.
[235:16.24]No, this is not a ride.
[235:23.46]Why is it here?
[235:30.25]Sorry about that!
[235:31.75]Say, are you ready to hit the slopes?
[235:36.97]Hold on tight now!
[235:39.96]This wind will blow your ears back!
[235:43.48]Oh, Jesus!
[235:56.55]Goofy, why would you take a kid to this dangerous part of the park?
[236:09.10]Oh, look out!
[236:09.92]We're just going to go to the summit, eight-year-old!
[236:12.34]We've got to hit that slow!
[236:37.75]This kid is getting fucking destroyed.
[236:45.94]How do I jump over that?
[237:15.66]Too fast, too fast, too fast, too fast, too fast.
[237:19.35]This is long.
[237:19.89]Are there people in there?
[237:53.40]I saw it, I, but still, don't forget.
[237:55.88]Destroy it.
[237:59.98]Just shake it off!
[238:01.73]Careful now!
[238:03.01]Don't run into any icicles!
[238:29.37]Be careful, Goofy.
[238:30.35]You should probably take your own advice.
[238:40.12]How long is this?
[238:42.74]This is longer than any kart like Diddy Kong Racing Mario Kart level.
[239:10.44]Are you okay, Goofy?
[239:12.68]No, I'm not okay, Goofy.
[239:18.39]And when we're done, you're gonna get arrested.
[239:25.61]Boy, I thought he had the power over having a big heart!
[239:29.82]Sir, you're under fucking arrest for endangering a child.
[239:35.77]Sure is quiet here.
[239:37.95]Hope there ain't any... Yetis!
[239:41.27]Look out!
[239:42.15]Avalanche!
[239:43.67]Continue!
[240:13.05]Return to park.
[240:15.97]We're not doing that again.
[240:17.45]I want to ride Splash Mountain and then we're moving on.
[240:19.39]I'm going to take a water break and come back.
[240:22.55]We've got something really, really, really, really, really interesting.
[240:28.07]Oh, this is going to be a good one.
[240:29.47]When we come back, this is going to be a really good one.
[240:31.71]This was a nice little relaxing walk around Disneyland and have some fun.
[240:35.19]And then we get back.
[240:39.55]Okay, I got a good one for you.
[240:42.71]I'm gonna go get a thing for my hair.
[240:44.99]I'm gonna splash some water into my mouth.
[240:48.57]But I'm gonna ride Space Mountain first.
[240:50.93]Is the whole thing actually here?
[241:10.53]Look at it.
[241:11.95]OK, I get how this works.
[241:14.21]This map will help us find characters, attractions, shops, just about anything we want, except secrets, of course.
[241:21.95]So you got lots of choices where you want to go first.
[241:25.40]Come on, come on.
[241:26.04]That's pretty cool.
[241:27.28]All right.
[241:28.10]Where's Splash Mountain?
[241:29.28]Where's the entrance to Splash Mountain?
[241:33.78]Did I miss it?
[241:36.37]I just want to rise to Clash Mountain.
[241:37.67]That's all I care about.
[241:38.43]I don't want to do anything else.
[241:39.39]There's so many people in this park.
[241:44.17]It's right there?
[241:44.85]Yeah, but that was the Yeti one.
[241:46.10]Where is it?
[241:48.16]It's, like, right here.
[241:48.94]But where's the line?
[241:51.36]Is this the line?
[241:56.90]No, that's not it.
[242:03.74]I don't understand this walking thing.
[242:06.18]Just like... What the hell is this?
[242:14.61]It's right in front of me.
[242:18.61]I have to use my legs.
[242:27.49]No, you're alive.
[242:30.13]Where?
[242:30.67]It's right next to me.
[242:31.53]Where's the line to Splash Mountain?
[242:33.89]I can't fast travel to Splash Mountain, I'm already here!
[242:40.32]Where are my parents?
[242:55.08]I'm walking around in a circle around Splash Mountain.
[242:58.54]Splash Mountain is on the other side of the park.
[243:02.78]Xbox!
[243:05.31]Fast travel.
[243:08.09]Frontierland.
[243:16.83]Lie.
[243:22.78]That's Thunder Mountain, that's not Splash Mountain.
[243:33.93]I want Splash Mountain.
[243:37.17]It's right here.
[243:45.66]It's right next to me.
[243:47.86]I'm going to wander around until I find the fucking entrance to Splash Mountain.
[244:03.12]It's not right there.
[244:06.80]What the hell is this giant mountain over here then?
[244:13.75]Go to the Disney website and look at the actual map.
[244:23.01]Go back.
[244:26.43]Xbox.
[244:28.35]Fast travel.
[244:30.77]Frontierland.
[244:33.67]Go to entrance.
[244:40.15]That's not even in the game.
[244:42.53]I'm looking it up.
[244:51.96]I'm looking up where is Splash Mountain.
[244:58.30]Where is Splash Mountain?
[245:08.66]Where's Splash Mountain?
[245:11.84]It's in Disneyland.
[245:12.82]At the Walt Disney Brothers and the characters.
[245:16.90]It is in... Where is it located?
[245:19.60]I know, I know, oh my god, where is it?
[245:25.21]What part of Disneyland?
[245:30.80]You would think that a Google search of where the fuck is Splash Mountain in Disneyland would come up with an answer.
[245:36.08]The first like five responses are, it's a ride at Disneyland.
[245:39.78]It's also in Tokyo.
[245:57.69]Xbox.
[245:59.81]Fast travel.
[246:02.58]Critter County.
[246:10.66]Splash Mountain.
[246:26.09]I've been to Disneyland once.
[246:27.33]You think I know where Splash Mountain is?
[246:31.60]Some of you are, I got a season pass up there every weekend.
[246:51.26]Cordless today.
[246:55.14]Continue.
[247:05.04]Oh, how big is the door?
[247:11.50]The door must be five foot ten.
[247:13.40]So that means he must be... Now, bring the door.
[247:15.32]The door handle is two feet off the ground.
[247:17.63]How do you do?
[247:19.65]Do it.
[247:20.35]Do it.
[247:20.77]Do it.
[247:21.03]Here's the handle.
[247:21.79]Do it.
[247:22.11]Do it.
[247:34.13]And these here bees are going to be the best part of it.
[247:37.42]Y'all got time to come along, right?
[247:41.08]It'll be the laughingest time you ever had.
[247:43.64]Come on, let's get hopping.
[247:47.46]Now, this here briar patch is where I was born.
[247:50.70]I want to go off on a briar splash mountain.
[247:52.74]You're going to find it gnarly prickly.
[247:55.42]Better let me show you how to get through it.
[248:14.45]Alright, let's go!
[248:15.29]Alright, I'm gonna clean as I go.
[248:42.36]This next one is going to be fucked.
[248:47.74]Don't, like, clean as I go.
[248:50.22]Clean as I go.
[248:52.95]Why is Xbox Live opening a bunch of shit in the background here?
[248:57.05]Okay, I got to clean as I go.
[248:58.35]I'm not fucking around.
[248:59.07]I got to do things, because there are so many games here that I will lose track.
[249:03.93]And I'm not going to remember which ones we played, because this is, like, fucking 40.
[249:12.36]Alright, get rid of this one.
[249:13.40]I'm never opening that game ever again.
[249:14.80]I'm going to give it to probably some fucking niece.
[249:17.26]Or a nephew or whatever.
[249:18.94]Harry Potter.
[249:19.46]I might actually go back and beat Harry Potter.
[249:20.98]Let's put motion sports back in.
[249:22.90]Okay, that's that.
[249:29.93]What else do I got here?
[249:30.87]This is Harry Potter.
[249:34.73]Hold on to that one.
[249:37.97]Good, that's good to go.
[249:38.99]The biggest loser...
[249:43.48]Where's that?
[249:43.96]Where's that disc?
[249:44.58]Clean as you go.
[249:50.70]We played like 10 of these today.
[249:53.42]Biggest loser.
[249:55.60]Clean as you go.
[249:57.10]Jillian Michaels Fitness.
[250:00.22]There it is.
[250:01.68]You idiot.
[250:02.38]That just went on the fucking VR headset, didn't it?
[250:04.71]No, it didn't.
[250:05.15]Thank God.
[250:14.24]After I come back and get some water, I would stick around.
[250:17.71]Because coming up next is fucking Hulk Hogan's main event.
[250:22.54]See you in a minute.
[253:43.21]good for a little while longer let's get it going hydra I just did that's why I'm coming back from drinking some water back on camera brushed my hair
[254:14.15]See?
[254:26.70]By Panic Button Studios.
[254:28.14]Hulk Hogan's main event.
[254:30.62]This game, oh, by the way, sucks.
[254:32.42]It's got really great reviews.
[254:37.75]Hold your arm up to navigate the menu.
[254:38.95]Swipe toward your body to select a menu.
[254:40.61]Yes.
[254:43.34]You're not currently signed in with a gamer profile.
[254:45.34]You're not able to save game progress or earn achievements.
[254:48.32]What are you talking about?
[254:49.52]Alright.
[254:52.70]Create a wrestler.
[254:55.63]Let's go, body.
[255:00.35]Body shape.
[255:35.02]All right, what about stronger?
[255:37.16]No, fatter.
[255:40.66]Just as big as you can make them.
[255:43.21]Fatter, done, good.
[255:47.37]Head.
[255:47.59]Let's see, clock?
[255:58.78]Can I take a picture of my own face?
[256:01.85]Masher.
[256:03.97]Chins.
[256:09.19]It kind of has to be chins.
[256:12.17]There's also three, uh, chins.
[256:15.51]No, I mean, like, it has to be chins.
[256:18.90]Take the facial hair off, and that's the dumb thing that I did a week ago.
[256:21.82]All right, that looks good.
[256:23.48]I'm gonna itch in my ass.
[256:27.98]All right, body hair.
[256:30.47]Waxed.
[256:31.11]Yeah, that looks good.
[256:35.15]Hair.
[256:40.05]Bald.
[256:41.83]No, no, no, no.
[256:44.91]Trouble.
[256:45.51]Stripe.
[256:46.67]Trouble?
[256:47.21]I don't know.
[256:48.91]Not very many options.
[256:51.13]Facial hair.
[256:51.81]None.
[256:58.01]That's better.
[257:00.93]It still looks like there's facial hair there.
[257:02.37]What is... I said none.
[257:03.81]Why do I have... Alright, that looks good.
[257:10.91]I think that's good.
[257:11.67]I don't want any tattoos.
[257:12.55]Tell them I don't have any.
[257:15.13]Ear!
[257:23.14]I can't... I have to use my hand.
[257:28.70]Uh, shirt.
[257:38.37]Uh, let's go with pants.
[257:39.27]What do I want to do with pants?
[257:42.44]That's fine.
[257:44.90]I can put a hat on, too.
[257:45.90]I like my hats.
[257:51.08]That's all I can do.
[257:51.90]That's fine.
[257:52.94]I'll put on like the Jesse Pinkman.
[257:58.02]That was good.
[257:58.36]Alright, here we go.
[258:02.63]Game modes.
[258:03.37]Great wrestler.
[258:04.05]Extra.
[258:05.67]Game modes.
[258:06.97]Game modes!
[258:08.72]Career mode.
[258:10.56]Career!
[258:12.76]Bring it on, Hogan.
[258:17.44]I tell you what, Hulkamania is the game now, and I'm just going to keep on playing Hulk Hogan.
[258:22.12]I could have done a little bit.
[258:22.84]I could have tried a little harder for Hulk Hogan there, but no.
[258:28.05]Okay, dude, you ready?
[258:30.81]It's all good, man.
[258:34.96]Seriously, bro, you gotta bring your A-game now.
[258:38.00]You know that contest Hulk Hogan's running?
[258:40.76]What about it?
[258:42.72]The winner gets a wrestling contract.
[258:45.90]A shot at the big time?
[258:48.85]With the Hulkster himself in your corner.
[258:51.81]Sweet, let's do this.
[258:53.15]He's about to punch me in the face.
[258:54.33]He's taking on the competition.
[258:59.26]backyard at 360 pounds and ready for his first match he is that that's my name it's time to show off some signature moves perform the pose indicated by the icon the faster you fall off the little points it's like a dance game someone ought to wait
[259:40.06]I didn't do anything!
[259:49.07]If this is a dance game, I'm gonna laugh so hard.
[259:53.51]Dude.
[259:57.99]It's just doing it for me now.
[260:02.27]Why?
[260:02.49]What's going on?
[260:04.51]That's me!
[260:05.43]That's me cooking the burgers!
[260:07.73]That's me!
[260:10.25]Why can't I jump in as me?
[260:19.14]Am I supposed to be talking?
[260:33.34]Two wrestlers trade serious hits for the enjoyment of the bloodthirsty crowd.
[260:36.83]Block or dodge your opponent's strikes, then unleash your own attacks.
[260:42.19]Use your hands to block or lean to evade your opponent's punches and headbutts.
[260:45.75]To dodge, a kick, jump.
[260:50.34]After a solid block, counterattack.
[260:52.34]Use your head, either arm, or your legs to attack your opponent.
[260:57.58]Can I use my head?
[261:03.94]How's he still upright?
[261:08.54]Oh, what a slam!
[261:11.14]He's blocked the strike!
[261:13.73]That's smart move.
[261:19.67]Oh, what a headbutt!
[261:21.87]It's a miracle he still punches.
[261:23.90]You hear that hit connect?
[261:27.64]He blocks the punch!
[261:31.96]Ooh, that shot ought to make his dentist smile.
[261:36.81]Ooh, blocked the hit.
[261:38.53]He's stunned.
[261:39.95]That's some serious crazy right there, folks.
[261:44.59]Ooh, he just slapped him stupid.
[261:47.66]Slapped like a punch.
[261:50.48]This game just sucks.
[261:52.98]Guess we better put a call in to that fat lady, folks, because it's time for her to sing.
[262:07.55]at the back of the box.
[262:10.44]There's chairs.
[262:11.20]Hold on, I gotta wait for the chairs.
[262:12.84]Your opponent is stunned.
[262:13.74]Time to show off your slamming skills.
[262:15.58]Thrust both arms out to grab.
[262:17.34]Next, raise both arms to lift your helpless victim over your head.
[262:22.55]Once you have your opponent over your head, perform the indicated slam move.
[262:38.59]That was a lame throw.
[262:40.87]Get him.
[262:41.29]Grab him.
[262:41.81]Look at that grab, ladies and gents.
[262:47.73]Just listen to that body slam.
[262:55.30]He's on fire.
[263:00.92]Stop smashing his head.
[263:02.14]He's reeling.
[263:03.50]I do not like the look of this, folks.
[263:09.20]It's a Batman move.
[263:10.22]Batman had that one done, though.
[263:13.65]He grabs his opponent.
[263:18.01]And the suplex!
[263:20.61]Slams him down hard!
[263:31.15]This game is fucking awful.
[263:34.77]I would rather walk here on Disneyland and get an R-Draft.
[263:40.89]Do it!
[263:42.17]Go back to Disney and get an autograph!
[263:55.22]No, I'm giving it a chance.
[263:56.70]I gotta get the chair first and then... Look, every game has to be played for 30 minutes.
[264:01.37]You know that's the rule.
[264:02.13]That is a very strict rule.
[264:05.29]I don't make that rule.
[264:12.21]I don't make that rule.
[264:29.76]I thought I had to win all the way before Hulk Hogan cared about me.
[264:36.10]First, soften your opponent up a bit.
[264:37.80]Use your arms and legs to elbow, leg drop, club, or sit on him.
[264:47.66]Reach out with both arms to get a grip, then lean left or lean right to subdue.
[265:15.56]It's just QTEs.
[265:18.00]It's just Quick Time Events, the game.
[265:19.76]It doesn't really matter.
[265:21.79]What the fuck is happening?
[265:28.73]I'm covering him up!
[265:43.11]Will he break free?
[265:46.20]Oh, he's going to knock me out.
[265:47.70]He's going to kick me in the head like five times.
[265:49.70]He goes for the pin, folks.
[265:53.62]That was close, people.
[266:07.85]Oh, mercy.
[266:08.57]The stigma.
[266:13.59]I'm putting this disc into my shredder.
[266:16.05]Oh, got him with all that leg drop, folks.
[266:18.69]I'm just going to shred it.
[266:21.13]There's no reason for it.
[266:22.35]Oh, man.
[266:22.61]The elbow drop connects.
[266:26.13]Drop the leg like a sledgehammer.
[266:30.79]All right.
[266:31.17]Now, what's the problem?
[266:32.32]The pin is wrong somehow.
[266:34.08]This way?
[266:34.72]Lean this way.
[266:35.28]Oh, don't count him out yet.
[266:37.40]Kicks out of the pin.
[266:40.24]Uh-oh.
[266:41.54]Shoulders on the mat.
[266:48.82]What are you talking about, Hogan?
[266:50.36]He's just waiting for the three count.
[266:55.72]Hogan, what do you mean by this?
[266:57.48]It's all over now.
[266:59.03]I don't understand how this is happening wrong.
[267:02.67]There's some fight left in it, folks.
[267:10.55]It's been three seconds.
[267:12.74]Is this a 10 count?
[267:13.70]He just won't give up the fight.
[267:19.75]Uh, it's the match.
[267:20.53]I won the match.
[267:21.53]It's been like 12 seconds.
[267:26.13]Really?
[267:30.01]Dude, that was epic.
[267:39.07]Thanks, man.
[267:39.73]You think we can win?
[267:41.63]Yeah, we can win, son.
[267:42.99]Think positive.
[267:43.73]That was epic.
[267:51.19]They all take the same damn photos, don't they?
[267:53.35]It's been 30 minutes.
[267:55.65]It hasn't.
[267:56.27]It's been like 12.
[268:14.44]I'm sorry.
[268:14.94]No, one more chance.
[269:00.57]That was not a look at me.
[269:09.21]Shred the game on stream.
[269:10.55]Shred the game on stream.
[269:12.55]I definitely like my Shredder up here.
[269:16.14]Can you play Destiny Shredder?
[269:17.84]I think you can.
[269:21.86]read the disc on stream all right let's go let me just beat him quick no tutorials no nothing let's go the dialogue is broken anyways here we go he's blocked the strike who blocked the hit oh he's looking dizzy that's a smart move
[269:50.85]I can't take that one anymore.
[270:14.31]That game was terrible.
[270:18.21]I ain't doing that one anymore.
[270:20.29]Shred it.
[270:20.71]Shred it.
[270:21.11]Shred.
[270:21.53]Shred.
[270:21.95]Shred.
[270:22.42]Shred.
[270:25.60]I can't.
[270:29.58]I can't.
[270:36.95]I don't know if I can shred it.
[270:38.05]What if I can't shred it?
[270:39.07]What if it's not allowed in my shredder?
[270:57.55]Which one of these do I want to play?
[270:58.99]This is where it gets hard.
[271:02.38]Alright, I think it's time to bust it up.
[271:08.34]I think so.
[271:10.04]Time to play Wipeout.
[271:28.75]Shred this one too!
[271:32.03]I'm just gonna shred like six games at the end of this stream.
[271:36.03]By the way, I still got two fucking full horror games.
[271:40.21]Might be seeing those tomorrow.
[271:42.29]Depends.
[271:49.45]Wipeout!
[271:52.53]God, that whole Kogan game was just awful.
[271:55.49]There was no redeeming qualities at all.
[271:58.13]Harry Potter game was actually pretty legit.
[272:00.07]I'm going to say Harry Potter.
[272:03.25]Anytime, anywhere, ABC.
[272:08.49]Oh, right.
[272:08.75]This is an ABC show.
[272:11.05]Harry Potter and... When I got scanned that first time in Jillian, I'm like... And...
[272:27.34]What have we been playing?
[272:30.64]Oh, when I threw for a touchdown.
[272:31.86]Oh!
[272:31.92]I could win this.
[272:55.91]I could beat this.
[272:56.61]I would destroy this course.
[272:58.96]There's no way I would ever accept falling down.
[273:02.60]If I got onto Wipeout, I would not fall down one time.
[273:07.34]That is a 100% guarantee.
[273:12.22]Hold your hands over the button to begin the game.
[273:13.64]There we go.
[273:14.10]Wipeout.
[273:14.71]In the zone.
[273:19.99]Who is it?
[273:21.17]Is it Tended Ragoon?
[273:25.66]It's me!
[273:26.10]You don't know me?
[273:28.39]It's me!
[273:30.89]It's me!
[273:35.93]It's me!
[273:42.82]So it is David.
[273:51.90]David's the, uh, the console.
[273:55.03]I don't know who the fuck that is.
[273:56.07]Who are these people?
[274:01.59]No, we're gonna use my avatar.
[274:04.85]MY avatar.
[274:08.31]Hard.
[274:09.87]I'm not fucking around.
[274:15.26]Oh, I... I can't.
[274:16.62]I have to actually go in order.
[274:25.38]Fine.
[274:27.34]This'll be a good warm-up.
[274:31.96]Alright, I'm feeling it.
[274:41.27]Why does it just taste like something about Jim Henson?
[274:43.33]What does that have to do with Wipeout?
[274:50.20]Baby mode, I tried to do hard.
[274:53.26]You saw that, I tried.
[275:04.51]Alright.
[275:04.85]You gotta run past it.
[275:06.21]And then... Cling on like Spiderman.
[275:07.61]The bouncy ball.
[275:36.17]Is this a first-person game or is this like a side-scroller?
[275:39.27]How do I traverse this?
[275:40.43]Yay!
[275:40.67]We're going already!
[276:12.86]shit I didn't know we were going that fast or I get it I get I know I got hit and our contestant grabs the ring another contestant gets the sweep clean up on aisle six
[276:51.09]Oh shit!
[276:51.67]How do I grab these?
[276:52.93]What do I do?
[276:54.77]Oh, they come out, they jump, they hit you.
[276:59.33]All right, we're good.
[277:35.49]Alright, I'm good.
[277:37.83]That person is really, really fucked up.
[278:01.83]Of course they replayed that one, but not the one where I bounced around like a dickhead for five times?
[278:17.29]God damn it!
[278:32.17]I don't understand.
[278:42.16]Whoa, Johnny.
[278:43.32]That's the number one chance in a stellar time.
[278:45.88]You're number one.
[279:03.64]Dark in here, huh?
[279:08.49]So far in the round, this is how things stand.
[279:11.05]I'm doing fine.
[279:11.75]I'm winning.
[279:14.29]The Eliminator?
[279:16.59]Oh, I've seen this before.
[279:18.19]You gotta just get... Dab with your avatar.
[279:19.91]I promise I won't.
[279:20.77]Snapshot?
[279:21.21]No, don't do that.
[279:22.37]Just, let's go.
[279:53.39]He didn't even try.
[279:54.41]I don't even get a chance to continue?
[280:30.13]After the Eliminator, this is what we have.
[280:32.59]Shit.
[280:35.30]Down to their final moment, contestants will now face the Wipeout Zone.
[280:40.16]The Wipeout Zone?
[280:41.25]I don't remember this thing.
[280:44.34]Let's take a look at our wipeout zone.
[280:46.06]I like it so much, I can tell I'm gonna like what I see before I even see it.
[280:50.40]Uh, gotcha.
[280:51.30]Welcome to the Blades of Fury.
[280:52.92]I'm a big fan.
[280:53.98]Welcome to the Super Mario 64 First Bowser level.
[280:58.94]This is the screwdriver.
[281:00.57]Stay on the rotating log or end up on a tool.
[281:04.51]This is the crankshaft.
[281:06.19]All those arms are for hugging, Johnny.
[281:08.91]Let's see what Joe Wagner's up to down on the course.
[281:11.37]Let's see if we can get all fucking eight red coins.
[281:21.25]It says snapshot.
[281:22.21]You don't understand?
[281:22.89]Here we go.
[281:46.37]That was horrible.
[281:46.93]Shit!
[281:47.17]I'm alright.
[281:48.01]What's going on?
[282:19.64]All right, go.
[282:23.84]What?
[282:25.80]Mimic the pose.
[282:33.78]Stop!
[282:34.14]And the sweeper arm's really taking it to him.
[282:36.72]Next time, might I suggest running away?
[282:40.46]Our contestant cannot be liking this.
[282:44.30]But luckily for me, I do.
[282:53.18]This is impossible.
[282:53.86]Nobody can beat this.
[282:54.62]Go, you idiot!
[283:21.61]Good.
[283:22.84]Right in the head there.
[283:24.12]See, now that's using the move.
[283:58.02]I win.
[284:01.12]I win.
[284:07.88]I won it.
[284:08.38]I did it.
[284:10.17]It's like Final Jeopardy.
[284:11.15]I got all the points at the end.
[284:12.33]Number one.
[284:26.03]$50,000.
[284:29.91]Give me the check.
[284:31.01]The contestants fought like warriors and deserve all the credit in the world.
[284:35.17]Is that the whole game?
[284:35.91]Because they get the credit doesn't mean they get the cash.
[284:38.61]It's the way it works here, John.
[284:40.03]For John Anderson and Jill Wagner, I'm John Henson saying good night and big balls.
[284:50.80]That's it.
[284:52.82]That's the whole game.
[284:59.32]No, that was easy.
[285:00.22]That was easy.
[285:01.02]I just... I don't... What?
[285:16.01]I have to play all three of these?
[285:17.49]Let's go.
[285:17.83]Beat this game?
[285:18.49]I'm not gonna beat this game.
[285:49.16]I can't.
[285:49.82]I can't.
[285:50.36]It's too much energy.
[285:55.09]You take too much energy to do this.
[286:18.44]Hurry up!
[286:18.84]Damn it!
[286:19.86]Hurry up and go!
[287:01.94]What is hard like?
[287:04.74]I gotta start back here again.
[287:05.90]I'm shredding this too.
[287:43.66]Our course doesn't discriminate, John.
[287:55.95]And he gets the Dreaded Sweeper on him.
[287:58.17]I dreaded you.
[287:59.11]That's why I'm... Why are you not running?
[288:01.31]I did it!
[288:03.98]I did it.
[288:05.94]Okay, it's just... avoid these things.
[288:11.02]Our contestant grabs a ring.
[288:12.78]Nice work.
[288:13.58]Just keep doing what you're doing, friend.
[288:20.75]One more ring here, Johnny.
[288:22.11]Ring.
[288:22.93]Collectible.
[288:24.01]Makes sense.
[288:27.63]Whoa, this player really got it.
[288:29.96]No, he got it all right, Johnny.
[288:31.20]He just doesn't seem to be getting it.
[288:59.40]All right, watch it.
[289:00.74]Watch out.
[289:01.28]I can get it ready.
[289:04.50]One, two, three.
[289:07.00]And here's another ring grab, Johnny.
[289:09.00]Man, this contestant's got the eye of the tiger and the hands of a white receiver.
[289:23.98]I can't jump.
[289:26.10]My legs are cement right now.
[289:59.99]I had a chance to get dumped.
[290:20.12]Oh, another big hit thanks to the sweeper arm.
[290:23.16]Perfect, because I was just going to say... He's like a fucking personal AC unit.
[290:28.02]He is knocked out by the sweeper arm.
[290:30.64]Knocked out, knocked over, knocked under.
[290:32.84]Take your pants, Johnny.
[290:38.06]The back wall sweeper takes him down.
[290:40.42]Yeah, he just looked confused, but in his defense, so was I.
[290:46.88]I did it.
[290:47.34]Alright, I'm not gonna mess this next one up.
[290:49.11]I'm ready for this one.
[290:49.89]This is the one we just have to jump.
[291:02.72]You just have to jump.
[291:16.07]That's it.
[291:17.71]Nothing else.
[291:20.32]No, I'm not ready.
[291:20.80]I am not ready.
[291:21.16]Wait.
[291:46.58]What do I have to do?
[291:56.28]Oh, our pitcher's mound takes down our contestant.
[291:58.87]That is one wicked mound, Johnny.
[292:02.75]Oh, our sweeper arm hard at work here.
[292:06.01]And definitely giving this player the business.
[292:16.57]It's too much to do that.
[292:18.25]It's too much to jump in a fucking place in your room.
[292:21.17]I'm going to have to, like, drink a bread bowl.
[292:26.78]Big pitcher's mountain wife out here, and he is not abused.
[292:39.20]He gets the credit, sweet frog.
[292:41.24]I credit you.
[292:42.20]That's why I'm up here, not down there.
[292:57.54]This one is the most intense of the whole night.
[292:59.69]This is more intense than the first exercise one.
[293:06.39]I gotta find a way to, like, make it so I, like, don't have to jump.
[293:10.06]Can I get, like, a pair of shoes and just hold them and go like this?
[293:13.32]Do I have, like, any shoes up here?
[293:15.12]Do I have to have, like, shoes?
[293:59.14]He wipes out on the pitcher's mound.
[294:00.96]He didn't even make first base.
[294:03.26]You said that, John.
[294:04.36]Well, excuse me for being trapped in a video game.
[294:11.21]Now that's a big wipeout on our pitcher's mound.
[294:13.87]Proof that if you wait too long, you're gonna lose it, Johnny.
[294:25.21]and the sweeper arm's really taking it to him.
[294:27.77]Next time, might I suggest running... That's fucked up!
[294:30.29]The thing's tilted!
[294:34.19]He wipes out on the pitcher's mound.
[294:36.03]He didn't even make first base.
[294:37.86]Didn't you already say... He wipes out on the pitcher's mound.
[294:40.62]He didn't even make first base.
[294:47.54]Big pitcher's mound wipe out here, and he is not amused.
[294:59.59]What am I supposed to do about this shit?
[295:01.89]What a broke-ass game.
[295:11.73]He wipes out on the pitcher's mound.
[295:13.57]He didn't even make first base.
[295:24.48]Now that's a big wipeout on our pitcher's mound.
[295:26.90]Proof that if you wait too long, you're gonna lose it, Johnny.
[295:30.19]You're repeating yourself.
[295:31.15]Uh, what was that?
[295:32.59]You're repeating yourself.
[295:33.71]Look who's talking.
[295:42.07]I'm gonna press the button.
[295:45.68]And there's a pitcher's mound wipeout.
[295:47.52]Great, I've been looking forward to it all day.
[295:55.27]It's time to put in a different one.
[296:32.44]This one's got much better traction, I've heard.
[296:34.20]I'm of course talking... How about Wipeout 3?
[296:46.20]Not Wipeout in the Zone.
[296:57.93]Is this the same game?
[297:02.84]Just packaged differently?
[297:04.91]It's not, right?
[297:11.36]It's not.
[297:13.06]Welcome back to the new season of Wipeout.
[297:15.02]Last season broke every record we have.
[297:17.06]And this season is going to blow that one out of the water.
[297:20.78]Our new course is chock full of devious surprises.
[297:24.27]It appears the contestants are ready to go down there.
[297:26.39]Let's take a look.
[297:27.33]Here they are, a whole new batch of fresh, willing victims.
[297:30.61]We have kids now?
[297:31.55]It's like Disney in the morning 3D animation.
[297:36.86]Looks like they're off to a good start.
[297:38.36]Well, it is ABC, so it makes sense.
[297:40.10]Ooh, that was a close one.
[297:41.70]This is like Paw Patrol animators.
[297:45.30]Love is in the air, Johnny.
[297:46.99]It might actually be a Paw Patrol animator.
[297:49.33]I think it is.
[297:50.09]That's why they call it tough love.
[297:52.17]Up, up, and away.
[297:54.21]Here's where it all went wrong.
[297:57.81]All right.
[297:58.61]Let's go.
[298:00.12]What's this?
[298:00.60]A cuter and possibly sweeter side of Wipeout?
[298:04.26]Guess that's a no.
[298:12.80]Hang in there, contestants.
[298:14.76]Our most spectacular season ever.
[298:17.10]Welcome to Wipeout 3.
[298:21.51]Greetings, salutations, and hello there, children.
[298:25.17]Ballsy, welcome back to a new season of Wipeout.
[298:28.89]Now with new and improved motion controls.
[298:31.97]This season there are two... There are two what?
[298:40.02]You cut off.
[298:40.84]Why is it so much better than the last one?
[298:44.81]Better motion controls, better game.
[298:47.77]Shred this one.
[298:50.09]We hope you have... Blackout in the Zone was not a very good game.
[298:53.45]This is a new one.
[298:54.29]We hope you shred Blackout in the Zone.
[298:56.58]Wave, hello.
[299:00.92]Better motion controls, my ass.
[299:15.83]It's me.
[299:16.38]Hello.
[299:19.84]The same shit happened in the last one.
[299:27.05]I am signed in.
[299:28.05]What are you talking about?
[299:44.37]Main menu, great job!
[299:46.29]They haven't really done anything yet, John.
[299:47.77]Quick play, single player, wipeout party.
[299:50.23]Single player!
[299:53.37]Uh, contestants, shop.
[299:55.74]Home.
[299:57.88]Contestants.
[299:59.46]Oh, oh, pick me, pick me!
[300:02.48]Uh, Timothy Wright.
[300:04.46]Uh... Timothy Smith.
[300:08.28]Branslam Gregg.
[300:10.92]I think I'm gonna have to be Branslam Gregg.
[300:17.23]Oh, what about the Painter?
[300:21.49]Nah, Grand Slam Drake, for sure.
[300:29.09]What if it's Football, Hockey, Cricket, Shuffleboard, or even Wipeout?
[300:31.60]Let's do it.
[300:32.54]Let's go!
[300:33.38]He's got a red shirt on.
[300:49.31]Who knows?
[300:49.69]They're all so good.
[300:50.60]Deck the balls.
[301:04.39]Hello, and welcome to Wipeout.
[301:06.41]It's freezing out there, Johnny.
[301:08.07]You bet it is, and you'll be happy to know I'm wearing faux fur designer boxers.
[301:13.59]Not really.
[301:14.44]Tis the season to deck the balls.
[301:16.64]Santa promised to bring me lots of Wipeouts this year, John.
[301:19.32]He wouldn't promise you anything to get you off his lap.
[301:22.16]Time to go a-wastling through our qualifier.
[301:24.64]When looking at this holiday course, I can tell you our contestants are in for one... Jump when you're ready.
[301:31.01]Let's see if it is better.
[301:32.63]This seems a little better.
[301:43.13]Stop!
[301:56.70]Oh, that is some angry aerosol.
[302:00.70]So much better.
[302:03.02]Punishing, Johnny.
[302:08.53]It is crunch time.
[302:10.35]What a cracker.
[302:12.35]What?
[302:12.69]Did you see that, ref?
[302:17.23]I think I'm just tired.
[302:18.75]I'm tired.
[302:20.75]What a drubbing.
[302:22.81]It was Harry Potter that fucking ruined me.
[302:24.57]Nice.
[302:27.89]That checkpoint's in the bank.
[302:36.78]Wait, I want to see this one again.
[302:39.76]Oh, little boy blue.
[302:44.24]Legendary.
[302:45.60]What even happened?
[302:47.50]Why didn't I go forward?
[302:53.49]On purpose.
[302:54.99]Accessorizing with a brand new ring.
[303:01.69]Ooh, that's...
[303:12.77]Ring, ring, ring, ring.
[303:14.59]It's for you.
[303:16.83]In the stomach, Johnny.
[303:18.25]This player's a real belly glutton for punishment.
[303:23.56]Fucking Harry Potter, with all the expelliarmus and what the fuck, and the medicus and shit.
[303:26.66]Why not just do that?
[303:35.68]Hope no one blinked.
[303:36.96]They would have missed my whole run.
[303:39.01]Don't blink.
[303:39.41]Excellent work out there.
[303:44.29]Did we get a raid?
[303:48.43]Thanks, Tyler, for the raid.
[303:51.52]Like, 300 people just came over here from Tyler... Tyler, uh... Tyler... Tyler McVicker.
[303:59.88]Thanks a lot.
[304:00.82]Welcome.
[304:03.48]Time for a Fortnite dance.
[304:04.44]That's what I do every time I get a raid.
[304:06.56]I do a Fortnite dance.
[304:07.56]Just kidding.
[304:16.20]As you can see, we're doing some Kinect.
[304:20.28]It's Kinect weekend here.
[304:24.68]Pick a robot?
[304:26.40]Oh, now that's who's moving on.
[304:33.08]What?
[304:36.54]What's going on?
[304:37.10]What?
[304:38.92]Why was everybody saying that?
[304:40.00]Why was that not funny?
[304:40.90]I didn't do anything.
[304:41.80]What happened?
[304:42.20]All right.
[304:42.52]Here we go.
[304:42.96]I'm going to try to get this first try.
[304:44.78]Ready?
[304:45.10]Check this out.
[304:45.95]What does this mean?
[304:49.17]What is this trying to tell me to do?
[305:13.79]Am I taking a fucking lift on a bike?
[305:15.25]I don't get it.
[305:15.79]I don't understand.
[305:20.05]Oh, anybody get the number of that projectile?
[305:24.37]Sprayed.
[305:25.31]Clean up.
[305:25.73]Aisle two.
[305:26.31]And the fifth ring is in our player's hand.
[305:31.49]Technical foul.
[305:34.86]And off goes our contestant, Johnny.
[305:42.81]Oh, that is some angry aerosol.
[305:49.74]I'm right here.
[305:51.88]Grand slam.
[305:54.40]I have to have qualified.
[305:55.96]Look at these fucking armpits.
[305:57.36]Holy shit, you can see it back here.
[305:59.82]They're doing me proud, Johnny.
[306:07.79]I got so many game show games.
[306:11.70]By the way, one of these game show games was insanely expensive.
[306:19.91]Why would a robot be allowed to do this?
[306:22.43]Seems unfair.
[306:24.68]Look at the bottom left.
[306:27.65]Round three.
[306:28.79]You haven't been bumped and pushed this much since Black Friday.
[306:31.45]10 bucks?
[306:31.75]No, it was 50.

[363:17.71]I would have destroyed this whole desk.
[363:19.61]Thank fucking God I caught myself because I have fucking gamer skills.
[363:28.80]Show us both your hands.
[363:29.62]Show us both your hands.
[363:30.56]Both your hands.
[363:31.16]I know.
[363:32.18]Show us both your hands.
[363:33.70]Show us both your hands.
[363:35.38]Look, I will.
[363:36.70]Just hold on.
[363:37.32]It takes a minute.
[363:38.50]Walk away.
[363:39.50]No.
[363:42.50]See?
[363:42.74]Did you hear anything drop?
[363:44.14]You didn't!
[363:45.29]You didn't hear anything!
[363:47.05]You would have heard like a if I had dropped it.
[363:51.21]There's nothing to drop.
[363:52.29]I don't have anything to drop.
[363:54.25]There's nothing to drop.
[363:54.99]That would be the Blue Ridges of North Carolina.
[363:58.05]Is that your final answer?
[364:10.64]Yes.
[364:15.51]Congratulations, that's the right answer.
[364:18.85]You've won $500,000.
[364:19.97]I'm over just a fucking million!
[364:29.84]Siri, can't someone wait for tomorrow?
[364:32.76]TV's The Simpsons is set in fictional Springfield.
[364:35.98]Sly reference to the locale of Wet 50 sitcom.
[364:39.05]Leave it to Bieber.
[364:40.81]Father knows best.
[364:42.77]Ozzie and Harriet.
[364:44.34]Make room for Daddy.
[364:47.54]I think it's really good to be here.
[365:00.11]Let's not make room for that one.
[365:05.25]It's not frickin' morning either.
[365:07.43]What the fuck are you talking about?
[365:11.89]Um...
[365:24.89]I don't know.
[365:25.37]I have no idea.
[365:26.23]It's probably Father Knows Best.
[365:30.53]Father Knows Best.
[365:31.81]Is that your final answer?
[365:34.69]Yes.
[365:34.95]I don't know.
[365:35.61]Whatever.
[365:35.89]If I lose, I lose.
[365:36.60]Who cares?
[365:39.68]You got it right.
[365:40.92]I was about to press the button on the Xbox.
[365:44.02]You've won a million dollars.
[365:48.77]I thought that was 500,000.
[365:49.29]I feel so unfulfilled.
[365:49.91]Oh.
[365:49.97]Yes!
[366:23.59]Welcome to Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.
[366:27.65]Oh, my pants!
[366:29.25]No, I don't want to do this again.
[366:32.33]No.
[366:32.51]I'm going to bed.
[366:34.95]That's it.
[366:35.49]Stream over.
[366:36.53]That's it.
[366:38.62]That's it.
[366:38.88]Yeah, that's it.
[366:40.22]I want a million dollars.
[366:41.48]That's it.
[366:41.96]That's it.
[366:44.84]I'll see you tomorrow.
[366:45.50]I'll see you tomorrow.
[366:46.10]We're going to do it tomorrow.
[366:47.28]Six, seven hours tomorrow, too.
[366:50.40]Hey!
[366:51.81]You can use the jump the question line two times in this round.
[366:56.67]You won't win any money for the question.
[366:58.25]9 p.m.
[366:59.37]bedtime.
[367:00.37]Here's the first question.
[367:03.43]Better get Star Wars tomorrow.
[367:06.45]Oh, I don't know.
[367:07.63]Do you think he don't have it?
[367:09.13]Located in what U.S.
[367:10.69]state?
[367:11.47]Texas.
[367:12.91]South Carolina.
[367:14.75]Florida.
[367:16.27]New Jersey.
[367:33.35]Why would I do that?
[367:33.95]That's the one everybody wants to see the most.
[367:46.47]Shred Hogan.
[367:48.29]I don't think... Hold on.
[367:49.55]Let me see if I can Shred Hogan.
[367:52.39]Why would I do that?
[367:53.25]Somebody could play it and enjoy it.
[367:58.76]If I, like, donate that game or something, somebody might, like, play it.
[368:02.18]I don't know.
[368:03.33]I don't want to, like... I don't want to shred a game.
[368:06.57]That thing's probably pretty rare.
[368:09.09]These things are not... They're rare antiques.
[368:20.81]You're gonna make somebody's life... You're gonna make somebody really sad.
[368:23.54]No, but if you wanted to play, what if you love Hulk Hogan?
[368:38.52]I'm not gonna shred a disc.
[368:40.34]I'll break my shredder.
[368:50.14]Nah, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[368:52.28]Tomorrow, believe it or not, let's get on cam.
[368:56.58]Tomorrow, believe it or not, we're starting early.
[368:58.58]That's right, we're starting early.
[368:59.86]And I'm going a lot, I'm going fucking all day tomorrow.
[369:03.74]You hear that?
[369:04.80]Open your ears for a sec.
[369:05.91]Going all day tomorrow.
[369:08.06]I'm starting tomorrow at Sunday.
[369:09.86]We're going to do Sunday during the day.
[369:10.98]Probably going to start around 1, 1, 2 p.m.
[369:16.30]Pacific.
[369:18.44]Is he drunk?
[369:19.26]No, I'm just... I've been jumping up and down in the fucking corner of my room for six hours.
[369:29.53]He is... I'm not... I drank a Coke.
[369:34.83]I have one Coca-Cola and, like, three glasses of water.
[369:38.03]Uh, so we're gonna start tomorrow at probably around 1 or 2 p.m.
[369:43.31]And then I've got... Tomorrow is the real kind of meat and potatoes.
[369:47.56]We've got Star Wars.
[369:48.50]We've got those two horror games.
[369:50.60]I've got Twister over here.
[369:52.56]Probably gonna open with Twister tomorrow.
[369:55.50]I would... I would... If you have time.
[370:01.85]That's all I'm gonna say.
[370:06.84]And there's like 15 other games after that.
[370:09.19]So I really don't know if I'm going to get through all of them, but we'll... Oh, and here's the... Let's get on cam.
[370:14.67]What do you say?
[370:16.15]So here's what's going to happen for this week.
[370:17.93]Tomorrow we're going to do more Kinect.
[370:21.31]And then I believe on Tuesday or when... Tuesday, that Ancestors game comes out.
[370:27.86]I'm going to play the hell out of that.
[370:31.84]Tuesday, Ancestors comes out.
[370:33.64]And then Saturday or whatever is Terraria.
[370:38.30]It's the game we play the monkey.
[370:40.21]The apes.
[370:42.41]And you have to level up and survive.
[370:46.15]It's a roguelike Ancestors ape game.
[370:52.57]It seems like it's going to be a lot of fun.
[370:55.17]But I'm willing to put at least one or two streams into it.
[371:01.61]Alright, let's get off camp.
[371:02.41]I don't like it.
[371:05.52]It's Days Gone Part 2.
[371:06.94]I don't know, it seems it looks way more interesting than Days Gone was.
[371:14.04]But that's kind of the games that are on tap for this week.
[371:17.16]The rest of Kinect?
[371:17.94]Well, next week too.
[371:20.47]Steam page says 2020.
[371:21.93]Oh, I thought, no, that's for a console.
[371:30.02]It launches on PC like two or three months before console.
[371:33.38]Weirdly enough, that's one of the only games I think that's done that in a long time.
[371:43.72]Why does this already have a 3 out of 10?
[371:44.82]What?
[371:44.98]3.6 out of 10.
[372:08.50]Oh, it's because it's on the Epic Store only?
[372:10.27]Is it only on the Epic Store?
[372:11.47]Do I actually have to download the Epic Store for this?
[372:26.39]Well, I still want to play it, though.
[372:27.83]It looks like people say it's not that good.
[372:30.35]There's a couple of reviews that say it's not good.
[372:33.45]Well, I'm still going to play it.
[372:38.53]Yeah, it goes to PS4 and Xbox One, I think, early next year.
[372:43.47]Or late this year, something like that.
[372:46.35]I'm just gonna do it.
[372:46.95]I'm playing it.
[372:48.03]But, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[372:50.64]We're gonna do the bits.
[372:53.54]Rewind the clock a little.
[372:58.82]To 6 hours and 15 minutes ago.
[373:04.40]We had...
[373:06.29]A ton of community subs from Phylactery Lich.
[373:10.41]69 subs.
[373:11.09]We had Austin Atlantis, 50 subs.
[373:13.20]Phylactery, $250.
[373:15.46]Abe Keshim.
[373:18.64]Abe Keshim, 50 community subs.
[373:24.14]There was a ton of community... There was too many to count.
[373:29.54]There was a lot of money tonight.
[373:32.04]Thank you, all of you.
[373:38.91]Hundreds and hundreds of dollars and tons of community subs.
[373:41.61]It means a lot, guys.
[373:43.55]Thanks.
[373:47.69]We also had... Five dollars from Shelbykun.
[373:52.03]Thank you for the five dollars.
[373:54.23]They say, hey, Uncle Jerem, I have my pocket money.
[373:56.77]Also, what ever happened to Burger Boy?
[373:57.91]The last I heard of him was when you told that story about him eating the giant moth.
[374:02.39]Um, he's still, he's still kicking around.
[374:05.98]I mean, we live across the country from each other at this point, so... It's... We talk from time to time sometimes.
[374:14.65]He's... He has, like, a family and his own life, and... He just kind of does his thing.
[374:24.77]Whenever I'm back around Massachusetts, you know, I'll probably see him.
[374:33.50]He's got a video?
[374:34.30]Yeah, he did, like, make another video.
[374:37.34]Of him, like, eating cupcakes or something, right?
[374:45.14]Yeah, he's still the same fucking weirdo.
[374:48.10]So, don't worry, not much has changed.
[374:50.16]At least, I guess.
[374:57.13]It's him, like, laughing and, like, stuffing cupcakes down his throat and, like, puking it back up.
[375:01.24]It's not... You don't want to watch that video, I don't think.
[375:06.08]Yeah, he's doing alright, I guess.
[375:08.42]We don't talk as much as we used to, but, you know, I talk to him from time to time.
[375:13.75]But thank you for the $5, Shelby.
[375:18.17]Uh, Abe Cashem, thanks for the $10.
[375:21.89]Why did I donate to a moron?
[375:23.53]And then do the little, the, the three, uh, face thing.
[375:26.47]Cat, like, face thing.
[375:33.52]Thank you, uh, Abe.
[375:34.50]And thanks for your community subs, too.
[375:35.60]You gave a ton.
[375:37.50]Look at this.
[375:38.08]I can't even fucking... This, like, weekly bit thing is... I can't even look at this.
[375:46.64]This is ridiculous.
[375:50.99]Holy shit.
[375:55.17]But thank you for the $10.
[375:57.11]And your huge amount of community subs as well.
[375:59.25]SirK9, thanks for the $2.50.
[376:00.13]Can't believe you died to tree wheel.
[376:01.89]Pinwheels, shit of your cousin.
[376:03.65]Omega lol.
[376:09.26]I liked that game.
[376:10.14]That game was charming.
[376:14.12]RarePepeBodyLotion, thanks for the $15.
[376:16.82]They just say germapop.
[376:18.34]$15, thank you RarePepe.
[376:23.68]Thanks for dropping 15 bucks.
[376:28.65]Gonna charge my Bluetooth and my wireless headset.
[376:32.17]I love this thing.
[376:33.70]I am so pissed off that I didn't get something like this before.
[376:36.52]Think about how many streams you've seen where I just have that dumb dickhead attached wire to my body.
[376:44.80]And I never thought just to get a Bluetooth transmitter.
[376:48.23]What's wrong with me?
[376:49.75]I've been streaming for almost four and a half, five years.
[376:55.13]And I just two days ago got a Bluetooth transmitter.
[376:59.45]What's wrong with me?
[377:09.39]Because EMF is bad?
[377:10.63]Should I not be using this?
[377:11.41]Don't scare me.
[377:16.70]But thank you, RayPepe.
[377:17.56]Thank you, StefunkyChicken for the $5.
[377:19.35]Thanks for all the passion and effort you put into your streams.
[377:21.29]It really shows.
[377:22.55]If you're tired from Kinect post-stream and feel like screening it, I spent the last two weeks working on a video about a joke you made three weeks ago.
[377:29.71]Las Vegas... Las Vegas Noir.
[377:33.49]It's funny right when you said that.
[377:36.59]Look at this.
[377:38.01]Shit, did I get it?
[377:39.70]It just told me to take a break.
[377:40.78]It said you look tired.
[377:43.14]It just said it on the bottom of the screen.
[377:46.20]as if you wrote it.
[377:54.56]I think I need to talk about a couple other things too.
[377:58.44]There's like a bunch of shit that I'm like falling behind on.
[378:01.38]The activity book stream, I'm gonna have to push forward.
[378:05.13]I haven't had time to really... I want to talk about it in length.
[378:08.43]So that activity book Where's Waldo stream is gonna go forward another few, three, four, five days probably.
[378:16.53]Into like the first week of September.
[378:20.44]Just because... I really want to let people know what's happening if they want to contribute to it.
[378:24.81]I have just not had a chance at all to sit down and do it.
[378:27.97]And Phylactery Lich just gave another 20 subs, adding up to like 6 or 7 trillion or whatever they are.
[378:35.59]More subs from Phylactery Lich, 20 more.
[378:39.03]Your credit card's gonna melt.
[378:40.07]That happens.
[378:43.57]That should happen in Rocko's modern life, so you know it's real.
[378:48.13]Thank you, Phylactery, for the... How many community subs do you have now?
[378:51.72]This reminds me of... I remember a while ago there was somebody that had like 2, 3, 4, 500 community subs.
[379:00.74]Thank you.
[379:03.58]You not only have given that many subs, you've also... You're at 100,000 fits.
[379:09.83]And we're talking not lifetime, we're talking for the week.
[379:13.77]That's the week.
[379:18.19]Damn, dude.
[379:22.89]Thank you for the ridiculous support.
[379:25.69]I don't know what else to say.
[379:26.71]That's a lot of money.
[379:31.18]Hopefully he got a large raise.
[379:32.82]Yeah.
[379:34.22]I really hope so.
[379:38.72]But thank you.
[379:40.78]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[379:42.72]We also had...
[379:44.59]Oh, but anyways, to talk about not just the activity stream.
[379:47.68]I'll go... Pretty much the first thing we're going to do... Not tomorrow, because obviously I'm going to be jumping around like an idiot on Kinect.
[379:56.56]But on the Ancestors stream.
[379:59.24]That Tuesday.
[380:00.60]We're going to sit down and I'm going to talk about the activity book.
[380:04.00]And I'm also going to try to talk about a monthly community night where all videos and all artwork and we're going to go over that kind of stuff.
[380:13.99]once a month and just have like a whole viewing stream for a community night where we just relax we just kick back put on some music or whatever and just hang out for a few hours I'll be doing that once a month
[380:35.13]Because so many people as the channel has gotten a little larger.
[380:38.85]There's a ton of people now with really, really good shit.
[380:42.59]Really, really high quality videos.
[380:45.16]Original artworks and paintings.
[380:48.72]There's a lot of people that it would be great to show.
[380:50.94]And I think there's enough content there where we could get at least a few hours of just hanging out and talking.
[381:01.41]So it's not just going to be artwork.
[381:02.77]It'll be video content as well.
[381:05.44]There's a lot of people that make really good videos.
[381:08.56]Really high caliber, high quality videos.
[381:15.01]And I want to show them.
[381:18.51]It'll be kind of like it is right now.
[381:21.25]The only difference is it won't be a stream over screen.
[381:25.16]It will be community contributions.
[381:31.86]Don't become a react streamer.
[381:33.20]No, this is once a month.
[381:36.10]I'm too ADHD to, like, sit and watch videos every day.
[381:38.80]I wouldn't be able to do it.
[381:40.40]I would get up and fucking start.
[381:41.54]I would just start moving.
[381:42.72]I'd have to move.
[381:43.34]I can't just sit.
[381:43.90]I can't do that.
[381:50.00]Some people can.
[381:50.62]I can't.
[381:56.50]But that's what you can expect for if you, hey, I got a video or have some artwork.
[382:01.62]We're going to start to not show them here and compile them and actually have them.
[382:07.71]And I'm going to talk about it on Tuesday.
[382:11.19]So for further notice, I'm not going to be doing end of stream kind of video artwork stuff.
[382:20.23]We're going to hold on to them.
[382:22.69]There's going to be an official Discord channel that we're going to make to do that.
[382:30.93]I will be in that channel, I'll be able to pull stuff from it.
[382:34.23]So it's not just gonna be, like, not like the creative channel, but a, hey, here's like my community contribution that I think would be cool, and I think I've put enough time into it, and it looks like it's, you know, looks great, I think I'm really happy with it, you know, when you're like happy with it, and you want it to be shown on stream.
[382:51.01]The creative channel I think is good just to be an open forum for people, just to kind of talk and post stuff and talk about art and creative stuff, so...
[383:02.47]Do you remember just like a backpack?
[383:07.45]Backpack?
[383:11.79]What is my... What do you mean my backpack?
[383:20.04]Is this a new thing that I don't know of?
[383:24.50]Why did you guys start spamming this?
[383:28.97]You have ADHD.
[383:29.69]I have ADHD.
[383:30.47]Yes, I do.
[383:35.54]But thank you, Jamie.
[383:36.86]Jamie gave like two, four, six, eight, ten.
[383:38.90]You gave like ten, twenty dollars, twelve dollars here.
[383:42.61]Over the course of a bunch of different bits.
[383:44.17]So thank you, Jamie, for the bits.
[383:46.79]No messages, just a bunch of two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two in a row.
[383:51.24]Thank you.
[383:53.45]Thank you, Zake, for the five dollars.
[383:55.25]What's up, Jeremy?
[383:56.39]It's 4.30 a.m.
[383:56.87]in Finland and I'm drunk as fuck.
[383:58.89]Finally starting college on Monday.
[384:01.06]I fucking love your streams and the dedication you put into this.
[384:03.76]You're a natural.
[384:04.68]Love you, love you, love you.
[384:06.24]Cheers from across the pond.
[384:11.66]Cheers from across the pond.
[384:13.50]Drunk bits.
[384:19.37]Thank you so much, Zake.
[384:21.41]Thanks for the five dollars.
[384:23.29]Good luck in college.
[384:28.21]Get... Get good grades, but not too good.
[384:33.06]But good.
[384:33.58]You know what I'm saying?
[384:34.68]Get good grades.
[384:38.02]Is tomorrow going to be early?
[384:38.88]Tomorrow's going to start around 1 to 2 p.m.
[384:40.96]Pacific.
[384:42.56]We're going to start a couple hours earlier tomorrow.
[384:51.06]Just get good grades.
[384:56.67]You know what I'm saying.
[385:01.37]Thank you to... Apple Shift for the $5.
[385:06.58]Five bucks from Apple Shift.
[385:13.07]Hey, man, it's me, Gwen.
[385:14.37]I just finished all the rumbles, so I wanted to do another drawing for you that would celebrate them.
[385:18.65]Really hope you like it.
[385:19.42]I've been working on it for about three weeks, and I finally finished.
[385:22.08]Thank you for inspiring me and being the best boy.
[385:23.72]Here's a link to the 4K version of it.
[385:25.40]We're gonna hold on to it.
[385:28.26]We're gonna hold it.
[385:30.29]Because this first community stream is gonna happen way sooner than you think.
[385:35.13]I'm probably gonna do this...
[385:40.76]The first one will probably happen before the carnival stream.
[385:47.66]Tonight.
[385:52.06]Because I really do think that once that channel is open in the next week or so, a lot of people are going to start to submit stuff and it will be very, very easy to do one.
[386:03.80]At some point before that carnival stream happens.
[386:11.97]And if not before, then very, very soon right after it.
[386:14.73]I can't imagine it would take a whole lot of time to get some great stuff.
[386:18.93]But thank you, Apple Shift.
[386:20.21]Hold on to it.
[386:21.27]Join the Discord and put it in that Discord.
[386:23.12]We're going to do this once a month.
[386:26.60]Because the reason... One of the reasons why is... Because it's at the end of the stream, right?
[386:33.00]When it says, stream over.
[386:34.15]Okay, good night, everybody.
[386:35.13]See you later.
[386:36.41]Most people leave.
[386:38.33]Right?
[386:39.49]And there's a lot of cool shit that I think people would like to see that we just put on the screen here, that I put on the screen when it's just kind of the, you know, like 40, 50% of all people have left.
[386:53.62]And I can imagine a scenario where, because think about some of those videos we've watched that were 10 out of 10 hilarious videos that people have made and less than half of the full stream broadcast audience got to see it.
[387:07.90]If people knew that that stuff was going to be available, and that was a night thing that we did once a month, I think... Oh my god, I almost like just... My tongue almost just like was eaten.
[387:22.93]I just ate it.
[387:24.59]It was like... I think more people would stick around.
[387:33.13]That was weird.
[387:34.05]It was like...
[387:40.41]And no, it's cause I'm, you know, it's cause look.
[387:43.85]I'm like kneeling on one knee and like going like, like hunching over.
[387:47.53]I gotta like get up.
[387:48.31]Alright, here we go.
[387:54.70]But, uh, thank you Appleship for the $5.
[387:56.34]Hold on to your art.
[387:57.44]We're gonna do a full night where we go over it.
[388:02.00]Thank you so much for any artwork that you give.
[388:04.15]I, I very strongly look forward to seeing it.
[388:08.89]That was a Little League coach?
[388:11.31]sit in a chair my chair is out not even in this room I had to move it but what do you say we move on we've only got a little bit more we've got teepo for the five dollars and ten cents hey german just want to apologize for last stream when I sent a bit message that could have been taken as slightly offensive and didn't realize until afterward
[388:33.12]When you stopped reading it out loud and skipped over it.
[388:35.60]It was my first time donating bits to a streamer.
[388:37.18]I wasn't trying to be an ass or anything.
[388:38.60]I hope you'll be able to accept my apology.
[388:40.72]Love the streams and love participating in chat.
[388:42.26]And try to catch your streams whenever I'm not stuck at work.
[388:46.99]Um... Yeah, I don't... I'm not really... I don't remember exactly what you're referring to.
[388:51.67]But I'll tell you something right now.
[388:54.31]You've got the... You've got the wherewithal to maybe know maybe something you said was maybe not cool or something.
[388:59.80]And you're accepting it.
[389:02.65]figuring it out and you're learning and you're moving forward that's all right you know you you're you've got you've got enough of a mind maybe to realize maybe something you said was wrong or stupid or bad or I'm not saying that I don't know what you said but
[389:28.78]You know, that takes, not only that, that takes some guts, and it takes, you know, a screwed on head, so.
[389:37.47]Stupid!
[389:40.41]You sound like a dad.
[389:42.79]No, but that's, like, true, though.
[389:44.20]Look, it'd be one thing, okay, imagine if, if, if, Tipo, imagine if instead it was five dolls and it said, hey, uh, you suck, I hate you, pee-pee-poo-poo, um, and then you kept going and you said, like, some offensive shit, and you didn't realize, you know,
[390:04.32]I mean, this is, it's been like probably two days.
[390:08.25]You've already like, gone.
[390:09.37]There it is.
[390:10.13]I know what I did was wrong.
[390:13.47]That can be ironic too.
[390:14.61]Oh yeah, yeah, I know.
[390:15.43]We're talking.
[390:15.93]That's not.
[390:16.89]Pee-pee-poo-poo is not offensive.
[390:19.67]It's not.
[390:20.99]That's like, five-year-olds say that and laugh and run away.
[390:25.35]That's not offensive.
[390:34.35]Yes, it is.
[390:35.73]Well, I don't know.
[390:37.87]I disagree.
[390:48.54]Yes, five-year-olds do make pee-pee poo-poo jokes.
[390:53.74]I will be facetimed by relatives that have young children.
[390:58.68]And sometimes they'll just be being like, you know, fresh.
[391:02.08]And they'll lean over and be like, Hey, doo-doo head!
[391:04.68]And then it's like, excuse me!
[391:05.90]And they go, ha ha ha ha!
[391:07.50]And then they like, they run away.
[391:08.44]And it's like, but don't say that!
[391:11.34]That still happens.
[391:14.02]So, come on.
[391:20.25]Did you wash the shit out of your hair?
[391:21.61]Now that's offensive.
[391:22.93]That offends me.
[391:25.71]I look forward to your apology tomorrow in bits.
[391:28.75]Tomorrow.
[391:33.45]No, T-Po, thanks for the $5.
[391:34.69]Don't worry about it.
[391:35.55]It's all good.
[391:38.22]Thanks for the $5.
[391:40.54]Lemon Pudding, thanks for the $2.50.
[391:41.86]You just said the best idea for a stream.
[391:43.48]Please do a puppet show stream.
[391:48.66]I don't know.
[391:50.89]I don't know about that.
[391:58.93]I don't think I could handle it.
[391:59.89]I don't think I could last.
[392:04.73]Maybe.
[392:06.39]We'll see.
[392:06.77]I'll think about it.
[392:08.25]But thank you for the, uh, for the recommendation.
[392:12.31]I have to go like this because I can't see the screen.
[392:17.31]This Xbox, that's another reason why I don't want to do this for more than like six, seven hours.
[392:22.29]This 360 is gonna explode.
[392:28.57]I put my hand on this thing.
[392:30.87]It's like an electric blanket.
[392:37.98]But thank you to Jake Sunrise for the $5.
[392:41.34]It is a video.
[392:43.02]It's called Jerma the Short King.
[392:44.46]We're going to hold on to this.
[392:45.26]Like I said, it is a video.
[392:51.67]It is artwork, creative.
[392:53.71]We're going to hold on to it.
[392:58.60]Please, when that channel is available... Throw that into that Discord.
[393:05.17]So we gotta start compiling them now!
[393:06.61]We have to start compiling these things.
[393:11.63]Don't worry, it's an Xbox Slim.
[393:12.81]Those don't red-ring, they just melt.
[393:14.35]That's what I... That's... How is that better?
[393:15.99]That's way worse.
[393:24.31]But I'm banned from the Discord.
[393:26.75]Well, I don't know why that happened.
[393:36.30]But I want to start compiling these now.
[393:37.98]And there's really only one way to do that, and that's to start now.
[393:46.37]But thank you so much, Jake Sunrise, for the five bucks.
[393:49.61]I look forward to seeing this video very soon.
[393:53.64]Thank you.
[393:57.59]What do you say we put on the credits?
[393:58.84]This is going to be ridiculous.
[394:01.32]There were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of subs tonight.
[394:09.10]He said my name wrong again.
[394:11.51]Jake Sunshine.
[394:14.17]What did I say?
[394:18.85]What did I say?
[394:20.41]I didn't say that?
[394:23.60]Here they come.
[394:25.30]Here come all the subs, all the sunrise.
[394:28.20]Oh.
[394:31.00]Shit.
[394:36.53]Thank you to S10WUpdate for the $2.50.
[394:39.13]Hey, Jerma.
[394:40.81]This reminds me of the time my parents got me three games for my birthday.
[394:44.21]Hulk Hogan Connect, Dragon Ball Connect, and Garfield Show on the Wii.
[394:49.41]So I'm glad someone else suffers with me.
[394:51.07]Hope you have Dragon Ball Connect as well.
[394:52.77]Peace and love.
[394:55.60]Uh, we'll see tomorrow.
[394:58.95]Garfield for the Wii.
[395:00.09]Did they think that it was a Xbox 360 game?
[395:04.23]Did... Did your parents just think that every console was the same console?
[395:07.69]That's happened to me before.
[395:11.05]Yes, uh-huh.
[395:14.50]And you don't have the heart to tell them.
[395:17.36]Oh, thanks!
[395:18.24]Thanks, Garfield!
[395:19.16]I can't wait.
[395:20.52]I can't even play this.
[395:21.68]I can't do anything with this.
[395:22.46]I'm just gonna put it onto my bed or something.
[395:28.78]Everything is the same.
[395:29.84]All consoles are the same consoles.
[395:31.80]Especially when they went to disk-based.
[395:35.15]Once everything became a disk, that got real confusing.
[395:38.19]To all the parents.
[395:46.61]Looking for my name.
[395:48.03]Mine.
[395:51.69]Maybe you'll see it.
[395:53.66]Somebody said, I fucking missed the stream.
[395:55.26]Hey, we got a VOD right there, and it's free.
[395:57.68]You can watch the whole thing.
[395:58.83]I recommend it.
[395:59.89]We had a lot of fun playing our Kinect.
[396:02.99]There's much more.
[396:05.75]I would dare say we got through a lot of the shitty ones today.
[396:09.89]No, what?
[396:10.71]No, there was like at least three or four.
[396:12.37]There were some of them that had really good moments.
[396:16.95]Our Kinect.
[396:17.63]It's ours.
[396:22.33]Uh, thank you though.
[396:23.45]Thank you to... Silent Serenity for the $2.50.
[396:28.11]Hi Jerma, could you stop streaming?
[396:30.22]I want to catch the VOD.
[396:31.36]Yeah, I will very shortly here.
[396:34.18]In less than five to ten minutes.
[396:37.20]Thank you though for the $2.50.
[396:38.20]Thank you Gnarly for the $2.50.
[396:39.08]So when are you finally gonna man up and play insert game here?
[396:43.18]I posted it three times on the recommended channel and you haven't played it yet.
[396:45.96]You're a bastard.
[396:52.05]I just haven't played it.
[396:53.17]Sorry.
[396:55.65]He's upset with me.
[396:58.73]Phylactery Lich gave another $15.89.
[397:00.99]And then the Great Canadian FK Club.
[397:09.26]Y'all remember Great Canadian.
[397:12.40]Speaking of money.
[397:15.58]That was fucking hundreds of subs before.
[397:23.60]He's back.
[397:24.60]No, he's still around.
[397:25.38]They're still around.
[397:27.08]I've seen him around.
[397:28.84]But thank you to the five community subs, Great Canadian.
[397:31.82]Thank you.
[397:35.13]Appreciate the five.
[397:36.19]Thank you so much.
[397:37.77]And to all the people that got those subs, you can now do Germa Earth.
[397:41.15]And Germa Venus.
[397:42.23]The two best emotes on Twitch.
[397:43.77]Just kidding.
[397:44.22]It's this one.
[397:47.55]I can't even do my own email right.
[397:48.85]I just, I may as well just fucking delete my channel.
[397:52.53]But thank you to Great Canadian, first of all.
[397:55.69]Phylactery Lich, your uncountable amount of money that you've given today and two streams ago.
[398:02.74]I just finally got to see a doctor about my ADHD and got medication for it.
[398:06.10]It's changed my life for the better.
[398:07.88]Good stream today, Jerma.
[398:08.74]Best on Twitch, in my opinion.
[398:10.32]Appreciate that opinion.
[398:14.01]Glad you have fun.
[398:15.51]And thank you for the ridiculous amounts of money.
[398:18.51]Speaking of money, Tingy just came in with five community subs, right?
[398:21.51]Back-to-back five community gifted subs.
[398:25.39]They're flying around all over the place.
[398:27.85]In every direction.
[398:30.19]Do you hear this in your left ear?
[398:32.03]Do I have one of those microphones?
[398:33.45]Tell me which ear this comes in.
[398:37.31]Hey, what's going on?
[398:37.93]It's me over here.
[398:39.48]Hey, what's going on?
[398:40.08]It's me over here.
[398:40.84]Does that change your ear?
[398:43.04]It's both ears.
[398:43.98]Ah, whatever.
[398:44.64]I don't have one of those cool mics.
[398:49.08]But thank you, both of you, for the five gifted subs.
[398:51.22]And thank you, Phylacteria Lich.
[398:53.64]I used to... When I was younger, I did medication for ADHD.
[398:56.54]But it messed up my appetite.
[398:58.50]So I stopped doing it.
[399:00.88]You know, I'm a smaller frame person.
[399:03.82]So when I was on medication and it was kind of stunting my appetite... I really... It wasn't good for me.
[399:12.34]So... When I went off of it, I went back to eating normally again.
[399:15.72]And really haven't taken any medication since.
[399:23.89]Yeah, I'm broadcasting in mono.
[399:24.97]I have to.
[399:33.58]Oh, Boo's in the chat?
[399:34.34]Boo's here?
[399:35.12]Boo is in the chat?
[399:40.78]Playing WoW Classic?
[399:47.88]Remember when I was in shape?
[399:48.76]I do.
[399:49.30]But I'm also getting... I'm like... I'm going to that stage of life where... I got other things that I have to worry about.
[399:57.84]Besides getting huge.
[400:01.18]I don't know.
[400:01.58]I think it will suck.
[400:03.86]I don't know.
[400:04.92]It's a tough one.
[400:09.32]I'm not even subbed to WoW at the moment.
[400:11.50]Not very many people are, I don't think.
[400:13.46]It's not really in a great state, I've heard.
[400:19.68]I was going to give it a try.
[400:20.72]I'm still deliberating on if I'm going to stream it or not.
[400:23.66]Probably not.
[400:25.00]Maybe.
[400:25.64]Eventually.
[400:26.16]I don't know.
[400:26.64]I'm going to flip a coin or something.
[400:30.38]I'm not sure.
[400:33.59]BFA is not good.
[400:35.93]It's unfortunate.
[400:45.08]Stream OSRS.
[400:46.94]What's that?
[400:49.45]Hey, Brent Muffins, Bert Muffins, thanks for the $10.
[400:52.25]I love your streams, especially since they calm me down when I'm going through stressful changes in my life.
[400:58.28]Thank you so much for the $10.
[400:58.92]I am more than happy to be somebody that you can watch and this community can be somewhere you can hang out to relax.
[401:08.80]That's, I'm really happy to hear that.
[401:14.94]Not happy to hear about you going through some shit, or whenever you are going through some shit.
[401:19.30]I'm not happy about that, but I'm happy that there's a community here of people where we can all relax and hang out and have a good time.
[401:27.01]All right, I'm going to ban all four of those words.
[401:34.41]All four of those words are getting put to the ban list.
[401:37.34]I don't even care.
[401:37.70]It's my name.
[401:38.40]Who gives a shit?
[401:43.80]But thanks for the 10 bucks, Burnt Muffins.
[401:46.34]Freudian Weapon, thanks for the 250.
[401:47.55]Hey, Jerm, I haven't said anything in a while.
[401:49.15]Just want to say that you're awesome and I love your stuff.
[401:50.69]Have a good night.
[401:51.73]Thank you, Freudian Weapon.
[401:54.15]Thanks for sticking up.
[401:56.31]Staying up.
[401:57.53]Sticking up.
[401:58.43]Thanks for sticking up.
[401:59.57]Thanks for sticking up for me.
[402:03.33]And that's it.
[402:11.92]Thanks a lot, everybody.
[402:15.11]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[402:22.99]Have a great one.
[402:25.13]See you tomorrow.
[402:29.99]Have a wonderful, wonderful evening.
[402:32.61]And by the way, the true Mitchie gave bits at the end here.
[402:37.09]Can you please PM one of the mods and give them your Discord name?
[402:43.53]I saw you pop up, and I want, I want, because I think I have the name wrong.
[402:47.56]When I tried to add you before, I think I may have fucked it up.
[402:52.74]But thank you.
[402:57.54]Good night, guys.
[402:58.24]See you tomorrow.
[402:58.88]More Connect.
[403:02.18]If I see you there, I see you there.
[403:04.40]Good night.
[403:25.29]you
