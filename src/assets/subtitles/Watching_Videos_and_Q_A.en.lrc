[ve:60.16.100]

[00:15.70]I thought it was a good idea to play these games, but it was a bad idea.
[00:18.44]What do you want me to do?
[00:20.74]Hold on a sec.
[00:41.17]Just play Red Faction now.
[00:42.63]That's too late now.
[00:43.57]It's like
[00:44.37]Already 10 o'clock.
[00:47.29]I'll start that tomorrow.
[00:50.28]Nice farm.
[00:50.76]Oh, yeah.
[00:51.06]Take a look at this.
[00:51.50]Watch this.
[00:51.98]Ready?
[00:52.20]Ready?
[00:53.24]Look at this.
[00:53.56]Look at how bad that is.
[00:57.76]Look at that.
[00:58.20]Look at, like, my skin tone difference.
[00:59.93]It's crazy.
[01:02.97]Am I sweating through this shirt yet?
[01:04.17]Yeah.
[01:04.65]Kind of.
[01:10.11]Thank you, MostlyLost, for the three bucks.
[01:11.78]Or five bucks.
[01:12.88]You promised us a movie stream three months ago.
[01:15.00]Wah, BabyRage.
[01:16.18]I know, and I was going to do something very specific, but I didn't end up doing it.
[01:21.04]Nice tan.
[01:23.08]That's still something I would like to do, but... Bought every fucking gothic game.
[01:36.89]Buy Gothic, he says.
[01:38.85]Play it on stream, he says.
[01:40.09]Buy them all.
[01:40.75]Buy all the Gothic games.
[01:42.07]Buy every single one.
[01:43.23]Play them on stream, he says.
[01:48.68]Sometimes I make mistakes.
[01:50.26]That was one of them.
[01:53.24]When am I going to do a tan stream?
[01:57.94]I don't know.
[02:00.44]Play the experience.
[02:01.26]That's something I would like if I told my grandkids I'll play them.
[02:06.48]Let's go... I got baited.
[02:09.56]So many people voted for it, too.
[02:10.91]I thought that's... I was like, oh, wow, this must be fucking fantastic, awesome games.
[02:14.43]And they might be.
[02:16.28]What?
[02:18.44]Bad streams.
[02:20.60]Well, that's okay.
[02:22.00]Let me like level with you guys a little bit here.
[02:24.26]Level with me.
[02:25.08]Level with me for a second.
[02:26.68]So like, sometimes I fucking try to find like weird shit to play.
[02:31.65]And when you find weird shit to play, like old weird shit sometimes doesn't go very well.
[02:37.01]It happens.
[02:40.51]I saw this in the monitor.
[02:41.75]I thought this was a person in the room.
[02:45.88]I thought this was a guy in the room.
[02:47.80]I looked over, I had this holding it right here, and I looked over at my fucking monitor, and this was a person in the room trying to get me.
[02:55.28]Like, I was like, what the fuck is that?
[02:57.80]I thought he was like back there.
[03:04.35]I still had fun.
[03:07.87]And sometimes you find the weird shit that's gold.
[03:09.69]That guy's when you put, when you dig your hands into shit without gloves on, your hands are gonna stink sometimes.
[03:20.47]Every time.
[03:21.11]No.
[03:21.91]When you put your hands in shit with one glove on... Okay, when you put your hands in shit with... You got two gloves.
[03:29.13]And you got one glove... You got one hand that's gloveless.
[03:31.98]And you put your hands in shit with a glove.
[03:34.06]Sometimes you pull out the shit and you dust it off and there's a diamond in there.
[03:36.80]Sometimes you reach your hand in with the other one that doesn't have a glove on it.
[03:39.54]Bang!
[03:40.30]Shit in your hand stinks.
[03:41.54]And your hand stinks.
[03:49.90]Alright, let's uh... Oh yeah, watch this.
[03:54.31]Watch this.
[03:55.95]Saving this for a rainy day.
[03:58.01]It's pretty fucking rainy out right now.
[04:01.15]What a shit stream.
[04:06.66]Stop fucking with my self-conscious!
[04:08.92]I'm self-conscious about this now!
[04:13.58]Why would you ever search without the glove?
[04:14.88]Because you, I don't know, you're itching your hair.
[04:24.25]Stop making me feel bad.
[04:25.45]Oh, we play all kinds of fucking weird shit.
[04:27.65]Look, listen to me.
[04:29.36]We play all kinds of fucking weird shit on this stream.
[04:32.18]It's inevitable that one of the times we're not going to have a fucking glove on our hand.
[04:35.18]You can't have a perfect fucking weird dumb game every time.
[04:38.18]It doesn't work that way.
[04:41.92]We're reaching in our hands in old shit.
[04:47.71]Go back to fucking WALL-E.
[04:52.84]Itching your hair?
[04:53.42]Like, you're just fucking itchy.
[04:54.32]I don't know, man.
[04:54.96]How am I supposed to know?
[04:59.23]Alright, we're gonna go to IRL.
[05:00.87]For, like, the next, like, 30 minutes.
[05:02.33]Give me a second.
[05:02.81]I'm just gonna sit around and fucking do some life advice.
[05:05.26]Give me one second.
[07:58.12]I'm trying to do something, right?
[08:02.33]I'm going to keep Goth of the 2000s because then people are going to think I'm like Goth.
[08:06.31]Like, who cares, right?
[08:10.84]No, that's a dumb name.
[08:20.35]Hanging out Q&A.
[08:25.73]QAA.
[08:26.91]Hanging out QAA.
[08:27.93]I was going to chill for a while.
[08:32.41]There it is.
[08:36.46]Put this back.
[08:37.06]There it is.
[08:45.05]Hi.
[08:45.73]How did this happen?
[08:46.65]I'm going to show you guys something.
[08:47.71]Ready?
[08:49.81]How did this happen?
[08:52.22]How did my headphone go through here?
[08:54.62]This is a pair of scissors.
[08:55.86]I need a pair of scissors for a very specific reason.
[09:13.78]Get out of town.
[09:16.06]Haircut string.
[09:16.90]I just start like cutting my hair.
[09:19.56]Alright, let's move to IRL.
[09:20.54]We're moving to IRL for the next little while.
[09:22.64]I'm going to chill.
[09:23.32]Let's move this.
[09:29.82]There we go.
[09:31.36]Got pants on, right?
[09:32.16]Is this even on HD?
[09:35.89]Let me make sure it is.
[09:40.05]I'm like a deer in headlights right now.
[09:46.53]Resolution.
[09:47.57]Custom.
[09:49.05]Hopefully this doesn't fuck up.
[09:53.36]1920 by 1080.
[09:54.68]Whoa!
[09:55.70]Whoa, that's too big.
[09:58.34]Too big.
[10:07.19]More deer in headlights.
[10:08.07]Let's go like this.
[10:08.73]Let's go like that.
[10:13.35]Now it's like, now it looks better.
[10:14.47]How much more high quality is this shit, huh?
[10:18.38]Like that.
[10:19.18]Like this.
[10:22.70]What happened to the top?
[10:26.00]What have you done to the top, man?
[10:29.26]Get up there.
[10:29.71]I don't know.
[10:34.19]It's being fucking weird.
[10:35.43]I can't get it to work.
[10:36.49]But whatever.
[10:38.41]Hi, we're in IRL now.
[10:40.82]This is real life.
[10:42.64]Real life stream.
[10:48.03]There we go.
[10:49.91]Put the chat there.
[10:51.85]Sit back in the chair.
[10:54.93]And let's talk.
[10:56.57]What do you guys want to talk about?
[10:58.29]What do people do on IRL?
[11:00.72]Am I supposed to do something in particular?
[11:04.54]People like sing.
[11:06.32]All I know about IRL is two things.
[11:09.14]People sing, people paint, and people walk around malls and shopping centers.
[11:17.11]I'm not doing any of those three things.
[11:19.13]Am I allowed to be here?
[11:21.45]Who knows?
[11:23.63]Go walk around Boston?
[11:24.84]No.
[11:25.14]First of all, if I walk around Boston, I ain't turning it on.
[11:29.74]There's no way I'm going to turn that shit on.
[11:30.98]I don't want you guys to know where the fuck I am.
[11:36.58]Which one was old?
[11:37.83]No, this one's new.
[11:41.11]You want me to comb my hair with the scissors?
[11:43.13]Okay.
[11:47.92]What do I think about esports getting...
[11:50.24]Good question.
[11:51.36]Good fucking question.
[11:52.16]We're going to talk about this.
[11:52.88]What do I think about... Those of you that are long-term viewers, right?
[11:56.36]Those of you guys that have been a watcher of my channel, like YouTube, for the last fucking five and six years.
[12:02.44]Do you remember when I made a video about fucking video games in the Olympics and everybody thought I was a fucking idiot?
[12:08.37]Everyone made fun of me and talked shit about... All the comments, go back.
[12:12.31]Go back to fucking the video where I talked about the Olympics in video games.
[12:15.61]And where every single person, and by not every single person, a ton of people told me that what I was saying was stupid.
[12:21.78]And like, dude, what are you talking about?
[12:23.04]You're a fucking idiot.
[12:24.70]And look what happens like fucking four and a half years later.
[12:29.90]I think that because of chess, I made the chess argument that chess was like a thing that was an Olympic sport.
[12:36.31]So it's the same deal.
[12:37.65]You have esports is just like chess now.
[12:42.07]It's like modern chess, especially games that are like...
[12:45.70]So it was a normal video.
[12:46.90]Oh.
[12:49.06]Hey.
[12:50.04]There's the door.
[12:53.96]Fuck you from the future.
[12:55.37]No, people thought I was like a fucking idiot.
[12:59.21]Let's go read some comments.
[13:00.35]Here's IRL.
[13:00.73]We're gonna do some IRL shit.
[13:03.21]Let's go read some comments on that video.
[13:05.89]You know what?
[13:06.23]Let's watch that video.
[13:08.49]Got some fucking content for you.
[13:10.05]Hold on.
[13:10.79]Give me a second.
[13:11.37]How do I do this?
[13:13.90]How do I do that?
[13:15.61]We're gonna watch that video because eSports and the Olympics is a thing that's coming up Jerma Olympics TF2 three and a half years ago gaming at the Olympics Hold on now Hold on now, what do you say we watch this video movie time Here is the browser source
[13:45.18]There we go.
[13:45.80]Hold on.
[13:48.26]Give me one second.
[13:48.92]Oops.
[13:52.04]Let's watch this fucking video right now.
[13:56.88]No, I don't want that.
[14:02.08]Here we are.
[14:02.54]Is it opening?
[14:06.22]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[14:07.32]Hold on.
[14:07.62]Wait, wait.
[14:07.92]Don't play.
[14:08.38]Don't play it quite yet.
[14:09.24]There it is.
[14:14.39]Okay.
[14:16.11]Let's watch it.
[14:19.90]Hey, everybody.
[14:20.30]Oh, what a fucking good video.
[14:35.89]that I was thinking about today.
[14:37.81]Actually, I thought about it last night, and I brought it up to Burgah Boy.
[14:40.03]Let's go over this.
[14:40.41]I was at Burgah Boy's house.
[14:41.91]We were sitting there eating McDonald's, late night McDonald's, and we were watching... We were?
[14:46.16]...the Olympic Games presentation, the opening ceremony.
[14:49.28]If you don't know what the opening ceremony is for the Olympics, the 2014 Sochi Olympic Games... Sochi.
[14:54.48]It's the country that's ever hosting it, whoever it is, if it's Russia, the United States, the UK, wherever it is.
[15:00.22]Yeah.
[15:00.50]They do this elaborate presentation where, like, oh, Abraham Lincoln, like, comes out with three women on his arms and they sing the national anthem.
[15:07.93]Like, they do this crazy presentation.
[15:08.95]Did I say this shit?
[15:09.51]What a fucking weirdo.
[15:10.47]And that's what we are watching.
[15:11.33]But forget about that.
[15:11.93]Forget I even said that.
[15:12.87]That's completely irrelevant.
[15:13.99]Get to the point.
[15:14.73]It's about the Olympics, though.
[15:16.59]and how I think there's been talk about this before right I'm not the first person to bring this up but always say that if you don't if you don't know what you're talking about no one can tell you you're an idiot winter olympics because the winter olympics can promote a more indoor atmosphere because the summer olympics as we all know you gotta be outside beach volleyball it's swimming it's all the cool sunny outdoor activities where gaming's kind of just we're all inside on a bunch of computers
[15:41.85]But that's cool.
[15:42.70]And I love the Winter Olympics.
[15:43.88]I love the Olympics.
[15:45.88]It interests me the amount of things that some of these athletes can do with their triple axles and their... It is cool.
[15:52.00]Did you see the Ukrainian woman?
[15:53.51]She fell on her ass.
[15:54.69]And the American woman, like, threw up in the back room and it's on TV.
[15:58.27]Like, I... That type of stuff, that real drama...
[16:01.15]Swimming is not a winter sport.
[16:02.11]It's really interesting to watch.
[16:03.57]I feel the same way about watching football or basketball or baseball or any of those sports.
[16:09.54]Any competitive event is awesome.
[16:12.40]Because I can just sit back in my chair and have a bag of fucking Doritos on my stomach and watch these people do these incredible feats of human strength and mental ability.
[16:22.44]It's pretty cool shit.
[16:23.08]And I'm just sitting there like, oh yeah, that was...
[16:25.33]That was really cool.
[16:26.69]I wish I could do that.
[16:30.11]And that's fine for me.
[16:32.11]And I think if gaming were allowed into the Olympics, and I'm not just talking about...
[16:39.38]Video games.
[16:40.52]I'm not just talking about playing League of Legends in a tournament versus Germany versus France or something for one of the competitions during the Olympics.
[16:49.56]I'm talking about board games too.
[16:51.40]We're talking chess.
[16:52.62]We're talking checkers.
[16:53.86]Checkers, I don't know.
[16:54.68]We're talking Monopoly.
[16:56.24]I don't know about Monopoly.
[16:57.32]Good.
[16:57.68]Monopoly would be like fucking stupid in the Olympics.
[17:02.04]I'm talking about the mental awareness games, the ones that are really directly one-to-one competitive with people.
[17:07.25]And there are a lot of board games, guys, that you and I have never even heard of that are very competitive, very directly involved with a 1v1 or 2v2 situation.
[17:17.54]And can you imagine watching something like that when there were gold medals on the line?
[17:22.83]And you bring that in alongside of video games, I think you can spice up these Winter Olympics like crazy.
[17:28.73]Because think of how many people actually watch the tournaments for some of these video games.
[17:33.44]Now, I don't know if there's any real televised chess tournaments anymore.
[17:37.12]I'm sure there are.
[17:38.10]There is, but nobody really watches.
[17:40.48]If you really wanted to, there's probably a chess site that has all kinds of stuff like that.
[17:44.83]But League of Legends.
[17:45.95]I'm going to use League of Legends as a complete example.
[17:47.65]How long is this video on?
[17:48.79]Now, I don't play League of Legends.
[17:50.65]I don't really follow League of Legends, really, at all.
[17:53.69]But when I see something like this, it's pretty ridiculous.
[17:57.25]Wait, don't make comments on this video.
[17:59.57]Like talking about the Olympics.
[18:01.83]32 million people watched the tournament, the championship game of that 2013 League of Legends tournament.
[18:07.74]I'm laughing at my own jokes.
[18:08.80]I'm laughing at you guys laughing at me, old me.
[18:11.88]How many people watched, like, the biathlon from the 2010 Winter Olympics?
[18:17.05]I don't know, but if for some reason that number is insanely huge, if you come to me in the comments section right now and you're like, hey, Jerma, the Archery Championship had 65 billion people watch it, then obviously I would retract what I'm about to say.
[18:30.96]If a game like League of Legends can pull in that type of audience...
[18:35.00]Why shouldn't it be in something like the Olympics when esports and when competitive gaming is getting more and more and more backing and more and more and more support and more people that care than ever before?
[18:47.73]I think we would see so many cool things if the Olympic Games allowed gaming.
[18:53.53]Now, obviously, the main drawback to this whole argument, this whole theory is...
[18:58.78]There are a lot of different video games.
[19:00.94]There are a lot of different games out there.
[19:02.96]And we have to fucking Olympic Committee determine what's the best one to do.
[19:06.59]And which ones are the ones that actually are very competitive.
[19:08.95]You said the same thing three times.
[19:10.35]That deserve gold medals.
[19:11.37]And that's not for me to decide.
[19:12.65]Almost there.
[19:13.73]It's just something I was throwing on the table.
[19:15.84]So if you're like a video game theory physicist and you can come up with those ideas...
[19:21.41]And maybe in like 5 years or 10 years or 20 years, however long it takes.
[19:25.23]And if it ever happens, if it never happens, then you know, whatever.
[19:29.07]But it's interesting to think about.
[19:30.29]5 years.
[19:30.67]I want to know what you guys have to say about this.
[19:32.68]Leave a comment if you'd like to below.
[19:35.76]And it's been about 5 years.
[19:38.78]Should we go back to other videos that I've made 5 years ago where I said something incredibly intelligent and everyone said I was an idiot and then it's a real thing?
[19:46.45]Unbelievable.
[19:49.62]Remember when I didn't do bad streams and was funny?
[19:51.74]Where were you two days ago?
[19:54.48]Where the fuck were you two days ago, dude?
[19:57.40]We had a great stream two days ago.
[20:00.25]Where were you fucking four days ago?
[20:05.99]Where were you yesterday?
[20:11.32]You can't just play one movie.
[20:17.90]Where are all the daily streams?
[20:19.54]I don't do fucking daily streams.
[20:22.30]It's never gonna happen.
[20:25.26]I did stream yesterday, actually.
[20:27.64]I did stream yesterday.
[20:28.90]I streamed every day this week.
[20:32.28]Come on.
[20:35.39]I've streamed every fucking day this week.
[20:42.23]Alright, that's movie night.
[20:43.21]What else we got on the movie night?
[20:48.66]Might and Magic was a lot of fun.
[20:51.26]I don't want to see no ResidentSleepers.
[20:52.74]That was a fucking fun game with a lot of fun shit.
[20:59.03]I love how this says Q&A and I've not answered one question.
[21:04.55]Somebody said something about the Olympics and esports and I went off and I fucking lost it.
[21:08.39]Calm down, Jerma.
[21:09.09]It's just a stream.
[21:11.25]Alright.
[21:12.17]Let's go.
[21:13.48]Castle Griffin.
[21:14.34]No, I don't want to...
[21:16.49]I don't want to watch, like, those videos.
[21:18.19]Like, you've seen those videos.
[21:19.61]I was making a point with this one.
[21:23.40]What about, like, what other videos do we get?
[21:24.96]Anybody got a good, like, cat videos we can watch?
[21:28.40]It actually says QAA.
[21:29.82]Q and A. Questions and answers.
[21:34.68]Stream myself watching the stream.
[21:38.04]I can't do that.
[21:40.01]Have I ever been to Europe?
[21:40.80]No, I have not.
[21:41.88]I have never been to Europe.
[21:43.50]Although at some place I would go eventually.
[21:47.56]I just actually got my passport not that long ago.
[21:49.76]So, like, for the first time ever.
[21:53.79]How big is... I'm not going to answer that question.

[22:52.18]I must have been on fucking drugs when I made it.
[22:54.22]I don't even do drugs.
[22:55.72]But I must have been on drugs.
[22:57.80]When I made this.
[22:58.32]Because there's no way I would have done this.
[22:59.94]A minute and 28 seconds.
[23:07.93]That's not it.
[23:10.25]This is it.
[23:15.11]I gotta have the intro here, right?
[23:21.03]I fucking hate this video.
[23:34.54]I got a new dog, so I made this terrible fucking video.
[23:46.51]Don't ever fucking watch this.
[23:47.57]I'm deleting this video after this.

[25:25.43]That's why my voice sounds like this right now.
[25:27.17]Is this a video?
[25:27.67]What is this?
[25:28.23]I'm getting better, which is good.
[25:29.49]No, it's an ad.
[25:30.05]I sound really goofy because I'm sick.
[25:32.33]My voice sounds so weird.
[25:33.69]Oh, it's like an... Okay, it's one of those...
[25:37.17]Okay, it's one of those ads that like, isn't an ad, it's like a video, but it's not a video.
[25:40.51]It's like an ad for a company, but it's a video.
[25:43.97]That was Anne Munition.
[25:46.89]She's like a streamer.
[25:49.19]What just happened?

[30:38.61]Sounds about right.
[30:39.13]You don't get free Steam games for no reason.
[30:41.33]Game mode is going to be Survival.
[30:43.68]That's the most interesting one.
[30:44.74]I can't get rid of it.
[30:45.80]More world options.
[30:46.94]Seed for world generator.
[30:48.08]Okay, this is important.

[31:23.88]Building terrain.
[31:24.70]Oh my god.
[31:25.38]This is so exciting.
[31:26.42]This is episode one.
[31:28.17]Oh, fucking my god.
[31:29.35]Who cares?
[31:30.51]It's Minecraft.
[31:31.65]I was so late to the party.
[31:33.13]I made a Minecraft.
[31:34.09]This is my first Minecraft.
[31:35.17]Minecraft was already a fucking popular game for like fucking three years.
[31:38.25]Where the hell am I?
[31:40.64]I spawned on top of a mountaintop.
[31:42.70]Wow, that's interesting.
[31:43.52]Sound has to be lowered, definitely.
[31:47.14]Okay, lower that, lower that.
[31:48.78]I was so late to the party.
[31:49.74]Here comes episode one.
[31:51.51]Sounds about right.
[31:56.11]Alright, so apparently I spawned on top of a mountain.
[32:00.58]Say it again.
[32:02.38]This is a good seed.
[32:03.36]What's that?
[32:04.52]We're going to explore it right now.
[32:11.16]Go!
[32:11.38]Glad to see I still do that joke every fucking stream.
[32:14.72]I want to get down to that.
[32:15.44]That's the home right there.
[32:16.56]Good to see I still got that one up my sleeve.
[32:18.42]I'm going to have to explore.
[32:20.16]See if I can't do this.
[32:21.36]Hold on.
[32:21.66]I got an idea.
[32:22.34]I got a plan.
[32:23.08]I can't take it.
[32:23.62]I have to stop.
[32:25.26]I can't take it.
[32:25.80]This is how we do it.
[32:26.73]No, I can't do it.
[32:27.63]I can't take it.
[32:28.23]We have to stop.
[32:28.69]This is like 19 minutes.
[32:30.13]I don't know if you guys are actually really ready for this.
[32:32.69]Are we ready?
[32:33.15]What are we ready for, Jeremy?
[32:35.77]I'm going for a skydive.
[32:38.75]This is kind of cool.
[32:39.55]Remember, if you hold shift, you don't fall off.
[32:42.24]That's something I didn't know when I used to livestream this game.
[32:44.98]That's true.
[32:45.38]I...
[32:46.94]Are you guys ready?
[32:47.90]I used to stream this game?

[33:30.32]You gotta get trees.
[33:31.76]That's the first thing you gotta get.
[33:32.96]Why do you despise yourself?
[33:34.40]No, look, I don't.

[41:02.13]Welcome to the monthly meeting of the beers.
[41:04.57]This isn't even me.
[41:05.06]It's time of the month where we assemble all the beers.
[41:07.94]Wait a second.
[41:09.08]Wait a second.
[41:09.92]This is not even me doing this.
[41:11.40]We're going to watch this one.
[41:14.39]Oh, it's just a still, but hold on.
[41:15.45]Just agree on something, you know what I'm saying?
[41:17.61]And I'd just like to let everyone know that the head beer has still taken care of our joint bank account, which has $16 in it.
[41:25.70]We always have $16 in it.
[41:27.82]So if anyone wants any hot dogs or burgers or donuts, then just talk to the head beer.
[41:33.54]Hey, Mr. Beer, I got a question over here.
[41:36.56]Yeah, yeah, what do you got for me, mister smaller than average beer?
[41:41.21]Well, uh, just outside I saw a very large rat, and he said he makes all the rules.
[41:46.13]What do you think, smaller than average beer?
[41:52.23]Perfect.
[41:55.23]I made this video a little fucking good.
[41:57.46]It was fucking pretty good.
[41:58.42]Ah, you couldn't see it.
[42:01.14]It was just a still.
[42:01.90]It was a still frame.
[42:02.66]It wasn't a video.
[42:07.56]the fuck keep watching have I seen all the rat remixes I actually I've heard some of them I watched a handful of them this is embarrassing what why is it embarrassing somebody made like a fucking bia video whatever I don't know what this is what's this
[42:32.52]Dude, this is just like I click random links in chat and like hope I don't get banned from Twitch.
[42:36.62]Like, is that what we're doing?
[42:37.40]Like, apparently.
[42:38.24]Alright, we're gonna watch it.
[42:40.08]We're gonna watch a trailer.
[42:41.20]We're gonna pull up like a movie trailer.
[42:42.76]We're gonna be like the... Let's see here.
[42:46.18]Hold on.
[42:48.40]This is supposed to be a Q&A.
[42:52.62]Twitch roulette.
[42:53.72]Like, just play Twitch roulette.
[42:57.20]Raven's Cry music.
[43:01.93]Yeah, we need videos.
[43:07.32]No, we're not watching the whole Jerma gets clipped thing.
[43:11.26]We've seen that a thousand fucking times.
[43:13.64]Alright, how are we ending this?
[43:19.64]Let me actually answer some questions.
[43:21.86]Because the title is a lie at this point.
[43:27.71]There's a Dark Souls 2 mod that replaces the rats with the rats... rats music?
[43:33.23]That's cool.
[43:35.87]No, rat, no, no, rat.
[43:37.19]Like, guys, you guys can, like, watch rat movie right now.
[43:39.21]I don't need to be here for it.
[43:41.51]I made that video.
[43:42.45]I know, I know what happens in it.
[43:47.37]Am I going to move to California?
[43:49.31]Maybe.
[43:50.47]Maybe.
[43:53.61]It's a... It's a possibility.
[43:56.43]I don't know.
[43:56.91]I have no idea.
[43:59.56]We want, you want me to talk about it.
[44:02.16]I want to make another one.
[44:05.40]What video am I most proud of?
[44:06.64]I mean, the obvious question is the live action rumble.
[44:09.64]That's like the most obvious one.
[44:11.85]Uh, besides that, the one that I think I'm one of my, my favorite like video that I think I've ever made besides like the live action rumble was, and I got to get the fucking stream lapse thing up here, man.
[44:20.35]I know I can't see anything.
[44:22.89]Uh, the Firewatch naked guy video.
[44:25.04]Like, the nude... I had a lot of fun making that.
[44:28.54]When that idea came to me, it was like, oh my god, I fucking... I have to make this.
[44:33.16]So, maybe that and the live action rumble.
[44:38.05]Why don't I stream every day?
[44:39.09]Because I don't have a game that I play every day.
[44:44.21]And every one of my streams, I want to try to do something different.
[44:47.67]I don't want to do the same thing every time.
[44:51.38]Sometimes a week goes by and I'll do a stream of the same game and we play Dark Messiah for three streams and I beat it but for the most part every stream is going to be like different and I don't want to do the same thing every time.
[45:04.59]But that's how we run into problems where like you saw tonight sometimes the game is just really bad or really doesn't work and I have a lot of technical issues that kind of fuck it all up but
[45:18.85]Um, I like to try to do something different every time.
[45:23.91]Oh, so, but anyway, cigarette spaghetti gave 50 bucks again.
[45:28.08]You didn't put the human cigarette in the rumble.
[45:29.86]This is the angry $50.
[45:31.24]This is the angriest $50 I've ever given.
[45:33.52]Also, is that a, is that the grapefruit shandy?
[45:38.36]Yeah, this, this is, this is the grapefruit shandy.
[45:41.52]Uh, Lyndon, Lyndon Lugal, whatever is, whatever the guy's name is, that fucking guy with the cursive name.
[45:46.93]Um,
[45:47.45]It's a grapefruit shandy.
[45:48.51]It's all I have in the house right now.
[45:50.51]So I had like some cider and then decided to drink this instead.
[45:54.96]But thank you so much, cigarette.
[45:56.24]That's fucking $150 now.
[45:59.34]Jesus Christ.
[46:01.04]That's a lot of money.
[46:02.50]That's a lot of cash.
[46:04.50]Drink this shandy right now.
[46:05.42]Shandy's a good summer drink.
[46:06.30]It's not a bad drink.
[46:07.52]I don't... Shandy is a...
[46:13.69]I don't like it unless it's like a hot day.
[46:15.85]If it was any colder than it is now, I wouldn't want to drink this at all.
[46:19.85]And I got to cut my fucking nails, man.
[46:21.37]I got like long Wolverine nails.
[46:26.57]But anyways, thanks so much, Cigarette.
[46:29.11]Massive contributions from you.
[46:30.42]And I don't want to burp on camera because that's rude.
[46:33.56]It's a seasonal drink.
[46:34.30]That's right.
[46:35.76]Canned jams.
[46:36.46]Thanks for the $5.
[46:36.98]Jerma, you're my favorite.
[46:38.14]This is fantastic.
[46:42.20]Is it though?
[46:42.70]I got...
[46:44.98]I could go real.
[46:45.70]You want me to go real?
[46:46.78]No, like, fucking jokes?
[46:47.63]No messing around?
[46:49.81]Like, yeah, I mean, I... For me to be, like, sitting here watching, like, videos and shit... I... I don't... Like... If you really think that, that's fucking... That... Fucking... That's... I don't even know what to say.
[47:07.06]I try.
[47:07.78]I'm trying.
[47:08.58]That's like... I guess that's the point I'm trying to make.
[47:11.83]I'll go real for a minute.
[47:13.31]And I'm not spying.
[47:14.02]Look, I'm not wearing this to be fucking tough.
[47:16.44]It was hot.
[47:17.96]And look what I did to myself.
[47:19.12]Like, look.
[47:20.20]Look what I fucking did to myself.
[47:25.28]I'm not trying to be like a tough guy.
[47:26.62]I'm not tough.
[47:28.29]Yes, I am.
[47:29.45]Watch this.
[47:31.81]Bet you wouldn't wish that was your fucking head.
[47:35.53]Crush it like a fucking grapefruit.
[47:36.85]You know what I'm saying?
[47:41.73]Show us the rest.
[47:47.10]Rip shirt.
[47:47.56]Not this one.
[47:48.00]This is comfortable.
[47:48.58]This shirt's too comfortable to rip.
[47:51.72]But I'm out of sync.
[47:56.73]Shouldn't be.
[47:57.63]Should be pretty much in sync.
[48:01.71]My hair got long.
[48:02.43]Yeah, I'm gonna grow it.
[48:03.75]I'm growing up my hair.
[48:04.99]A little.
[48:06.20]At least enough to, like, have it go.
[48:07.56]Because, I mean, when I get to... I'm losing my hair.
[48:09.38]I don't know if you guys know this or not, but, like, I'm fucking old.
[48:12.36]And when you get to be, like, 30 plus, like, I'm 30...
[48:16.51]I'm 31.
[48:17.79]So I'm going to be 32 this year.
[48:19.73]And when you get to be like older, you know, I'm losing my hair.
[48:22.80]I actually am losing my hair.
[48:24.80]And you might not be, you can't tell because the way the camera looks, it's, but I'm getting like thin man.
[48:29.74]It's getting thin and it's in my blood.
[48:31.38]It's in my, my, my father's bald.
[48:34.28]My, you know, my, my brother's starting to recede too.
[48:36.28]30 isn't old.
[48:40.48]I'm not, I'm 31.
[48:43.10]31 at that.
[48:43.48]I'm not, I'm not like 30.
[48:44.40]That's fucking older.
[48:50.90]Thinks 80 is hot and considers moving to California, but a California is not a wet hot Massachusetts is a fucking wet humid hot when it gets hot around here it gets to be Like you feel it on your face and it's like the air is hot.
[49:08.98]It's like getting somebody blowing like hot breath in your face California is dry heat.
[49:13.78]It's not wet humid heat like it is around here.
[49:15.80]I
[49:19.47]It's true.
[49:19.87]It's a true statement.
[49:21.77]What part of California?
[49:23.29]Hollywood.
[49:25.53]Somewhere around Hollywood.
[49:28.51]North Hollywood, West Hollywood, Glendale, Several Lakes, something like that.
[49:31.83]I don't know.
[49:33.11]Something like that, I don't know.
[49:34.83]But in like the Los Angeles, like Hollywood area.
[49:40.26]And I can't say anything else.
[49:46.85]There's a reason why I would be moving.
[49:49.25]But I can't.
[49:51.00]I may or may not even do that.
[49:55.58]Do I realize how expensive that is?
[49:56.76]Yes, I do.
[49:57.98]I do.
[50:02.12]Rat Hollywood... Rat Movie Hollywood Edition.
[50:08.45]LA is literally the worst place.

[50:20.86]I'm not back it up.
[50:24.01]I'm not moving to Los Angeles this is like In like the future it's a it's like a real possibility in the next like year that I will be living in LA It's not like a set in stone 100% thing, but it's I'll be like in the LA area Just put the put the put it in reverse if I can go backwards But don't hit the guy behind you because then you're gonna get a fucking parking ticket.
[50:47.06]I
[50:50.06]Am I going to keep streaming?
[50:50.72]Of course I will.
[50:52.42]I'm not going to stop streaming.
[50:53.48]This has been a lot of fun for me.
[50:55.68]I'm not going to turn off my stream just because I moved.
[50:59.28]It's just a different house.
[51:00.74]Different place.
[51:04.60]But, thank you Diabetles for that $5.
[51:08.99]Also, thank you to Dedo for the $5.

[51:27.06]No.
[51:28.76]I don't think so.
[51:30.40]I don't think I'd like to do that right now.
[51:33.66]Stream the trip there.
[51:37.89]Is this related to a surprise?
[51:39.31]Let me be very cryptic and very clear at the same time.
[51:52.35]There you go.
[51:57.65]There's like... Okay.
[52:03.25]No, I'm not getting married.
[52:05.87]I'm not getting fucking married.
[52:07.72]Like, that's not what's happening.
[52:14.42]There's like videos that
[52:20.71]Regardless of moving to Los Angeles.
[52:24.65]There's like fucking two roads.
[52:29.81]There's two roads.
[52:32.09]One is videos.
[52:35.23]Videos like videos.
[52:40.17]Hey.
[52:43.26]One is videos.
[52:45.56]And the other is videos.
[52:48.32]Like
[52:51.34]Hello.
[52:51.80]Yeah.
[52:52.14]Hello.
[52:52.76]Videos.
[52:57.28]No, not commercials.
[52:58.12]No, no, no, no, no.
[52:59.27]I'm trying to be clear.
[53:00.75]Listen to me.
[53:01.13]I'm being fucking clear.
[53:02.25]I can't be clear.
[53:11.11]There are potential opportunities over the next year for me to make shit.
[53:17.20]There you go.
[53:17.84]That's it.
[53:18.66]And there's like a couple of different reasons why it might happen, might not happen, it may fall through, but like, I don't know.
[53:26.14]It's like, I can't even, there's nothing to talk about.
[53:27.96]Like, I can't even talk about it.
[53:28.86]I'm not going to be one of those people that like pretends like something cool is happening when it just doesn't happen.
[53:33.17]Like, I don't want to be like, hey, how about that book I'm going to write?
[53:36.45]No, I'm done.
[53:37.45]I'm done.
[53:37.83]Like fucking, I'm going to, I'm not going to start telling you guys about like cool shit in quotes.
[53:46.39]I'm being too... I gotta dumb it down.
[53:53.23]I'm not doing porn.
[53:55.05]Please.
[53:58.43]Tell the ferris wheel story.
[54:01.65]There hasn't been a video on my main channel in a year.
[54:05.01]But that doesn't mean that they haven't been worked on.
[54:07.60]Or that I haven't wanted to do them.
[54:11.94]A lot of people are asking, like, what's happening to the main... Why are there no fucking videos?
[54:15.16]You said you were gonna make videos.
[54:17.32]I know.
[54:20.28]This hasn't been a main channel video in a year.
[54:24.03]And like... My pants are like riding up my ass.
[54:28.77]What's all the clutter behind you?
[54:30.23]A dirty, shitty room that I refuse to clean because I'm lazy.
[54:34.56]The guy in there, you know.
[54:38.44]Doesn't feel like a year.
[54:39.28]Not to me either, but...
[54:41.87]There is, I can promise you this.
[54:43.96]I'm going to make a 100% promise right now.
[54:47.22]You can fucking read my lips.
[54:48.44]Look, read my lips.
[54:51.10]Regardless of anything that happens.
[54:56.82]Regardless of anything that happens.
[54:59.58]With, like, if I'm going to do something or I'm not going to do something.
[55:02.68]There will be a new video on that main channel, potentially.
[55:07.26]Like, I'm going to make a main channel video, like, very soon.
[55:12.78]Now how do I make this smaller?
[55:15.78]I don't know.
[55:19.14]And by very soon, I mean like soon enough.
[55:21.92]It's being worked on right now.
[55:24.71]There's just a lot of like weird politics that might go into it later.
[55:28.19]I don't know.
[55:29.75]Because I can't know.
[55:31.43]I got like a fucking wicked hairy neck.
[55:33.35]Why didn't anybody tell me about this?
[55:35.56]Why didn't any of you guys tell me that I had a hairy neck?
[55:37.98]Now I look like an idiot.
[55:44.66]New video coming tomorrow.
[55:45.88]No.
[55:46.78]I'll see you later, your friendly neighbor.
[55:48.42]Thanks for sticking around.
[55:49.20]Thanks for coming in to say hello.
[55:53.42]Running for president.
[55:54.14]No political humor.
[55:55.14]What?
[55:55.62]No.
[55:59.08]No politics.
[56:01.26]You think I'm drunk?
[56:01.96]That would be very odd.
[56:04.07]I wish it was that easy.
[56:08.63]Three Linden Googles and I get drunk?
[56:10.87]That'd be great.
[56:13.63]What's my routine?
[56:14.73]I don't have a routine.
[56:20.23]Without getting into politics, what do you think of our current president?
[56:27.34]What do you mean without going into politics?
[56:29.50]That's like the gotcha question.
[56:31.74]Come on, man.
[56:36.70]Without getting into politics, what the fuck do you think about Trump?
[56:45.31]Am I going to run for mayor?
[56:46.31]No.
[56:49.63]Okay, I'll tell you what I think about the president of the United States.
[56:53.49]He's a guy.
[57:02.31]And that's all you're getting from me.
[57:12.41]You can't talk politics, no matter what.
[57:15.47]Even, okay, look.
[57:18.27]I'm going to tell you.
[57:19.67]Because, like, I don't fucking care.
[57:22.26]You want me to, like, be real?
[57:25.00]Let's talk politics right now.
[57:28.44]Sorry, mods.
[57:30.36]Get ready.
[57:39.40]I was a Democrat for a long time.
[57:44.35]My whole life.
[57:44.81]Pretty much my entire life.
[57:47.01]Like a center-left leaning Democrat.
[57:51.24]Not all the way over here.
[57:52.12]It was like here.
[57:56.44]And we're going straight up I, baby.
[58:00.76]Independent.
[58:02.44]I'm registering as an independent.
[58:06.18]There you go.
[58:08.43]We don't fucking choose sides on Jerma985.
[58:15.49]Radical what a radical fucking thought that is Look at all you guys freaking the fuck out The hipster party Radical independent you do that you didn't think that was coming did you?
[58:38.35]You know I was I was a Democrat for a while and I don't know I got him that fucking politics is stupid
[58:48.65]Welcome to the radical centrist.
[58:52.09]The, I don't know what I stand.
[58:53.25]I know what I stand for.
[58:55.91]Come on.
[59:00.10]Look, I got a lot.
[59:01.20]I got a lot to say.
[59:02.32]Let's talk about social security for a second.
[59:05.08]What the fuck is that?
[59:12.95]Global warming.
[59:14.21]Global warming my ass.
[59:17.94]I'm kidding.
[59:19.10]I'm fucking kidding.
[59:19.80]We're doing joke politics.
[59:21.72]This is joke talk.
[59:23.34]We're doing joke talk.
[59:28.84]Video games do not equal politics.
[59:37.19]Do a bit about airplane food next.
[59:38.79]No, I'm just kidding.
[59:39.65]For real.
[59:42.88]Like, everybody's beliefs are dynamic.
[59:45.70]We're all dynamic people.
[59:46.88]So, like, even if you call yourself a Democrat or a Republican or fucking, or like a spaghetti man or fucking a green tea man or whatever, it doesn't even matter.
[59:58.77]Like, you, everybody has opinions that are different.
[60:00.65]Like, you don't match up.
[60:01.93]Like, we don't have to, you know, like, picking sides, I always had a problem with.
[60:07.77]Because, like, I think everybody has dynamic opinions.
[60:11.45]You can be for something and for something else, but not have to be like on like a party.
[60:15.95]You know what I mean?
[60:16.41]Like, I don't know.
[60:17.45]I think we should get rid of the fucking parties altogether.
[60:19.41]Drop the D, drop the R, drop the I's.
[60:21.83]Just run on policy.
[60:23.07]And then we'll see how fucking scared these politicians get because they don't have a fucking base to run back to.
[60:29.18]You know what I'm saying?
[60:32.84]Let people, let all these politicians run on policy, not on fucking what they put in front of their name.
[60:38.77]Drop the D. Drop the R. Run on policy.
[60:41.37]We'll see what happens.
[60:47.93]Don't drop my D. Because then you would like... If the guy told you some things that you thought were interesting and you thought you would agree with, of course you're going to want to... And you'll look into that guy.
[61:00.56]You'll see what he's for, what he's not for.
[61:02.24]Maybe you don't agree with some of the shit that he says.
[61:06.70]How many billboards are you going to look at on the fucking side of the road that says, like, Dean Dingus fighting for you?
[61:16.10]And it's just like, who the fuck is this guy?
[61:19.40]Oh, he's got an R next to his name.
[61:21.32]I'm voting for him.
[61:24.32]What if you don't know what Dean Dingus even stands for?
[61:27.66]Dean Dingus might have strangled somebody.
[61:29.68]Do you know that?
[61:30.96]He might have strangled three people.
[61:35.40]Or, you know, like, hey, like, I'm going for the middle class.
[61:40.18]Like, I'm all for the middle class.
[61:42.78]Anthony Banthony.
[61:45.16]You know what I mean?
[61:45.58]It's like, oh, Anthony Banthony.
[61:46.42]Got the D next to his name.
[61:47.42]Oh, Anthony Banthony.
[61:48.28]He's for the middle class.
[61:48.88]He said it.
[61:49.18]He said he was for the middle class.
[61:50.30]He said it.
[61:52.52]And then the guy fucking, like, the guy owns, like, fucking $45 billion in, like, a fucking Swiss bank account.
[61:59.62]And he, like, hides it and shit.
[62:00.74]He's like, get the fuck away from my money.
[62:02.20]I'm Anthony fucking Banthony, motherfucker.
[62:05.80]I'm fighting for you.
[62:09.16]Yeah.
[62:12.82]Fight for what you believe in.
[62:14.30]Not, like, who you think is, like, you know, you gotta read into it.
[62:18.96]I'm about to get Anthony Banthony fucking Senate.
[62:23.94]Oh, God.
[62:27.93]But, no, I'm not, I don't know, like...
[62:31.31]I think politics, you don't talk politics.
[62:33.21]We're not even talking politics.
[62:34.31]We're talking like political theories.
[62:40.33]What about the speech on, end the speech with a Howard Dean yell?
[62:44.97]But there are people that are like way smarter than I am that talk about this shit.
[62:47.98]And like, I just, I don't, I don't like, I'm not like a big political person, but mostly lost just gave a hundred bucks.
[62:56.24]I hear you're running for president in a few years.
[62:57.72]Here's the first donation to your campaign.
[62:59.64]I would win.
[63:00.94]I would win as president.
[63:02.10]I would get on that stage.
[63:04.80]I would wear a hot dog suit.
[63:07.00]I would wear a straight up black suit with a bunch of hot dogs on me.
[63:11.52]And I would be Jeremy the hot dog Elbertson.
[63:14.76]And people would be like, what the fuck is he talking about?
[63:16.52]And I'd go over the toppings and shit about hot dogs.
[63:19.34]Like, that's mustard.
[63:21.62]That means fucking middle class.
[63:23.61]Like, there's the ketchup.
[63:24.75]That's a fucking 1%.
[63:25.25]You know what I mean?
[63:27.83]You know 1% of all people use ketchup on their hot dogs?
[63:30.51]Get the fucking 1%.
[63:31.01]You know what I mean?
[63:34.33]And the bun represents the fucking crumbling infrastructure.
[63:36.79]And I fucking squeeze it and rip it in half.
[63:39.14]And then the audience goes...
[63:42.10]And then I get all their votes.
[63:46.12]Anyways, thank you.
[63:47.12]Mostly lost.
[63:47.56]100 bucks.
[63:48.24]Fucking huge amount of money.
[63:52.00]I've lost all control at this point, so it doesn't even matter.
[63:56.75]Favorite emote?
[63:57.25]What do you mean?
[63:57.71]What's my favorite?
[63:58.93]Do I play any instruments?
[63:59.93]No.
[64:00.87]I used to play the drums, but not anymore.
[64:03.05]And I used to actually be pretty good.
[64:05.35]I was pretty good.
[64:08.50]If you get, like, if there was a drum set behind me, right, you gave me a drum set right now, I could play.
[64:13.94]It might be pretty bad, but I would play it.
[64:15.67]I could play.
[64:17.79]Yeah.
[64:18.77]I'm losing viewers.
[64:20.79]Shit.
[64:22.41]How do I get them back?
[64:23.73]Let's see.
[64:24.05]I haven't even looked at the viewer count in, like, an hour.
[64:28.21]How many people are even here?
[64:29.02]There's a pretty good amount of people here.
[64:33.40]Alright.
[64:37.37]But yeah, 100 bucks from Mostly Lost.
[64:40.11]That makes like, there's been like fucking $500 tonight.
[64:44.12]Because I'm talking about like fucking politics.
[64:45.82]Is this a politics stream now?
[64:47.76]I've seen those.
[64:49.44]We're not going down that road.
[64:51.84]I'm not talking specific politics.
[64:54.04]I'm just talking like humans.
[64:57.39]You know what I mean?
[64:59.21]Humans.
[65:02.09]We're all a little different.
[65:08.11]I don't want to be like a, I'm just here to fucking have fun and hang out with you guys.
[65:15.68]We're just, we're just a couple of humans.
[65:18.24]And that's what people fucking don't get.
[65:19.82]We're just a bunch of humans.
[65:22.96]Are you an alien?
[65:26.64]I am.
[65:28.52]And then my eyes shake back and forth and my tongue comes out.
[65:31.16]Reptilian.
[65:32.68]Jerm is a fucking reptilian.
[65:34.04]You know, actually like years ago, uh,
[65:38.15]Somebody, like, wrote that they thought I was a reptilian.
[65:41.03]Like, for real.
[65:41.69]And they, like, went off, like, a bunch of reasons why.
[65:43.23]Because my eyes move around a lot and shit.
[65:48.42]That's what I heard.
[65:49.00]I don't know.
[65:52.12]Like a bot.
[65:52.60]Thanks for the bits.
[65:54.10]Jerma is Switzerland.
[65:56.30]No.
[65:57.96]I'm an American.
[66:00.48]Do you like pancakes?
[66:01.47]Yes, I do.
[66:02.43]Poach fest.
[66:03.23]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[66:04.21]Appreciate it.
[66:06.41]I don't really eat them though.
[66:07.45]I'm not like a sweet breakfast kind of guy.
[66:08.89]I'm more of a savory breakfast kind of guy.
[66:14.61]Reptilian shape-shifting streamer.
[66:18.85]Oh, the first reptilian president.
[66:23.27]Have you played any mobile games that I would recommend recently?
[66:25.43]Actually, yes, but no, not really.
[66:26.87]This is more like an angry recommend.
[66:29.27]The game's called PPKP, I think.
[66:31.59]Yeah, PPKP.
[66:33.86]It's super...
[66:36.59]easy don't burp in somebody's face uh it's a really really addicting game with like two buttons where it's like a punch and a kick and it's it's really really annoying and like it you want to spend some money but you don't have to it's just fun to like beat up people with you know it's like a and I hate to say this word but it's like retro-esque it looks like river city ransom it's pretty fun
[67:01.72]I would recommend.
[67:02.71]If you... For, like, ten minutes.
[67:04.37]And then throw your iPad in the trash.
[67:06.63]And then burn it.
[67:08.37]And then take the iPad out and, like, dust it off.
[67:10.11]Because, fuck it, those things are durable.
[67:13.91]Do these IRL streams once a week.
[67:18.26]I'm not... I'm not, like, an IRL... I don't like being on, like... Look, I don't like being on camera.
[67:23.48]Unless, um... There's, like, a reason to be on camera.
[67:27.04]Like, obviously, like, videos and shit.
[67:29.12]Like, if I'm gonna do, like, a video...
[67:30.90]and be on camera or like a scripted thing where I have like lines and then yeah.
[67:35.85]But I don't... I don't like just like sitting here on the camera.
[67:40.43]It's like weird.
[67:40.93]I don't like it.
[67:45.03]Since you won't talk politics, what's your salary?
[67:47.35]Says Tara.
[67:50.11]I don't have a salary.
[67:53.00]You know what my salary is?
[67:54.76]Like you guys.
[67:58.22]You guys are my boss.
[68:00.39]All fucking 75,000 of you.
[68:03.41]I don't have a salary.
[68:05.87]I'm an introvert.
[68:06.61]I'm not an introvert, though.
[68:08.03]I'm very much an extrovert.
[68:10.13]I'm a very introverted extrovert.
[68:12.68]It's weird.
[68:13.66]I can talk to... You're fired.
[68:17.98]Get back to work.
[68:19.84]I'm trying.
[68:20.54]Boss, boss, listen to me.
[68:21.74]I'm trying.
[68:23.77]You get a room of people, right?
[68:26.43]And if you put four people in that room that I have to talk to...
[68:30.29]I'm terrified.
[68:31.95]You put 4,000 people in that room.
[68:35.13]I'll kill it.
[68:37.73]I'll do good.
[68:38.53]I'll kill it.
[68:39.07]You know what I mean?
[68:39.49]I'll do really good in that situation.
[68:42.37]Let's be clear with the context before anybody fucking freaks out.
[68:47.06]It's a good situation for me.
[68:54.58]yes but you put you put like a thousand people in a room I could talk to him all day you put two people in a room and I have to talk to him it's like I don't know my fucking ass from my eyeballs you know what I mean I'm just like yeah yeah what happened huh oh okay I've ever done the personality test the Myers Briggs whatever it's called the Briggs personality whatever it's called yeah I have ENFP was my personality apparently ENFP
[69:27.44]I guess there's a lot of ENFPs in the world.
[69:30.51]World.
[69:32.73]Same.
[69:36.21]Was I ever afraid to show my face for the first time?
[69:37.89]No, because I've always wanted to be like an actor.
[69:40.84]And it's the kind of was, it's not like it doesn't scare me to be on camera.
[69:44.56]I just don't, it just doesn't sit well sometimes.
[69:47.62]EDF ENFP.
[69:49.29]No, not EDF.
[69:52.60]The Myers-Briggs is not accurate has been disproven, but everything's been disproven.
[69:56.16]Dude, they used to talk about, like, how eating... Dude, they used to talk about, like, fucking how apples were poisonous back in, like, the fucking 30s.
[70:02.38]Dude, they used to tell you to smoke cigarettes back in the 20s.
[70:06.24]Like, disproven.
[70:07.04]Like, everything's disproven.
[70:08.34]The IQ test is disproven.
[70:11.24]Like, eating certain fruits is bad for you now.
[70:14.14]Like, drinking coffee is good for you now.
[70:16.16]Smoking cigarettes used to be good for you.
[70:17.68]Like, uh...
[70:22.87]We're just humans, you know what I mean?
[70:24.67]All we can do is just take every day with the techno.
[70:27.37]Dude, but you know, it's the times.
[70:30.11]We're part of the times.
[70:31.04]Like, fucking 200 years ago, they used to bleed people if they had a cold.
[70:36.02]George Washington died because he got, like, the sniffles and somebody drained all of his blood.
[70:42.04]You're a victim of the times and the environment.
[70:45.19]Like, we just know what we know now, right?
[70:46.73]Like, they fucking used to drain people's blood if they didn't feel well.
[70:53.12]It's true.
[70:53.46]Look it up.
[70:54.10]Look it up.
[70:55.02]It happened.
[70:58.56]It's the moments that we live.
[71:04.22]I got a fucking dry lip.
[71:07.90]It's a deep stream.
[71:12.26]What would your America be like?
[71:13.88]I don't know.
[71:18.68]That's a tough question.
[71:20.17]It's like...
[71:21.46]5,000 facets to what, like, what is and isn't, like, a country.
[71:25.52]And we're going to fucking not go that way.
[71:26.86]Because that's too deep for me.
[71:30.32]George Washington dead.
[71:31.19]Yeah, he died not that long ago.
[71:32.95]Like, 200 years ago.
[71:36.91]Politic bait.
[71:39.59]Political.
[71:40.65]Now, that's a deep question.
[71:41.73]Yeah, it is.
[71:44.40]Ugh.
[71:46.02]Much hair gel.
[71:46.50]I don't use any hair product on my hair at all.
[71:48.26]There's only... Sometimes I will spray this stuff.
[71:53.25]It's like a booster.
[71:54.37]It's like a spray booster.
[71:55.49]It's like a hair gel, but it's not a hair gel.
[71:58.15]You go like this and you spray your roots and you comb it through.
[72:00.21]It's not like product as much as it is like a little boost.
[72:05.44]What do I think of Valve's new game?
[72:07.08]You mean the card game?
[72:08.02]That's not a new game.
[72:09.00]That's like a game that's off of a game they already own that they decided to make a card game.
[72:14.04]um so valve making a card game right now is the same thing as when ea made a moba like a year and a half late what was that fucking stupid thing what was that moba that ea made that they it didn't even come out of fucking beta they like closed it it's the same thing what was it called it was like a superhero one nothing what was it what was it called no no it wasn't superhero one
[72:39.58]My god what the one that like didn't even make it was like they pushed it so much dawn gate there.
[72:43.70]It is perfect on gate It's just on they're doing a dawn gate and the game.
[72:48.00]It's like no who cares I Don't know why I was thinking of infinite crisis.
[72:54.57]That's what I was thinking of but I think if any crisis is still alive isn't it I
[73:00.13]But there's only, you know, Hearthstone, like Elder Scrolls, Legends.
[73:07.00]There's like a million different ones in development.
[73:09.80]There's like ones that are on the iPad.
[73:11.38]There's just card game, card game.
[73:12.58]They don't need any more card games.
[73:17.34]No, it's closed.
[73:17.97]Oh, wow.
[73:18.47]Okay.
[73:18.93]Damn.
[73:20.43]That's terrible.
[73:22.77]Infinite Crisis died after its real long... Well, that's what I mean.
[73:25.15]Like...
[73:26.40]How is The Elder Scrolls card game faring?
[73:28.86]Does anybody actually play it?
[73:30.52]Or is it one of those just dead games now?
[73:36.71]And Valve has so many other things.
[73:39.43]I could go off on a tangent about Valve right now, but I don't think I'm going to.
[73:43.47]There's so many things Valve could do for products and games.
[73:47.35]I don't know.
[73:49.81]I feel like that's the easy way out.
[73:50.85]Half-Life 2...
[73:56.02]They decided to do episode... Episodic content for Half-Life 2.
[74:00.72]Here we go.
[74:01.10]We're gonna do some episodes.
[74:02.94]Episode 1.
[74:03.80]There it is.
[74:04.32]Half-Life 2.
[74:05.04]Half-Life 2.
[74:05.91]Episode 2.
[74:07.17]Alright.
[74:07.63]Back to back.
[74:08.97]It's... You're never going to hear from us again.
[74:12.75]Like, what the fuck?
[74:15.07]And, like, I get it.
[74:16.09]They, like... There was, like, a bunch of transitions.
[74:19.19]Like, there was a lot of new... I hate to talk shit about Valve, but...
[74:25.87]Episodic.
[74:29.17]They had an opportunity to make something else.
[74:31.81]And they just kind of went into like the Steam route.
[74:35.48]Valve became a business, not a game company.
[74:37.58]They kind of canned a bunch of their products.
[74:40.88]And other people made their games for them.
[74:43.84]The last few games that Valve has come out with, they kind of didn't make them.
[74:48.73]Like Dota.
[74:50.97]I mean, Dota was like an in-house production, but they brought on people for Dota.
[74:55.63]It wasn't like in-house, like some guy at Valve was like, hey, you know what?
[74:58.59]I'm going to direct it.
[74:59.29]Wasn't it like, what's it, Frogman?
[75:01.91]IceFrog.
[75:02.37]Didn't IceFrog come over to, and like, wasn't he the director of the game?
[75:05.33]Didn't he make that game?
[75:06.76]Or am I thinking of something else?
[75:12.08]I made a video about this.
[75:13.42]Play it.
[75:14.96]We're coming full circle.
[75:19.65]Do I have that right?
[75:20.79]That they hired IceFrog to make Dota 2?
[75:25.58]He is an employee.
[75:26.56]Okay.
[75:29.24]They have to bring people in for anything now because they don't have enough people.
[75:35.17]And you know, I'm going to say that's what happens when you have like an open policy on anything that you can work on for employees.
[75:42.73]Isn't Google the same way?
[75:45.10]Like they have that like open policy of like, come on in and like ride a few scooters and like make some electric toast and then maybe do something for a product.
[75:55.56]Like when you have like an open, like nobody has to really work on anything.
[75:58.35]You can pick whatever you want to work on, right?
[76:01.71]That's kind of what happens.
[76:03.73]Everyone just kind of gets massages and doesn't fucking like, doesn't do their laundry.
[76:09.01]Laundry's done for them.
[76:11.43]You go, you walk into Google HQ and you like, you dump, you drop off your laundry.
[76:15.61]You get a massage.
[76:18.47]And then, and then it's time to go to work.
[76:19.85]But, but, but what are you going to work on?
[76:21.52]YouTube?
[76:21.90]YouTube's a piece of shit.
[76:23.36]Look at YouTube.
[76:23.90]Look what happened to YouTube.
[76:24.74]Look at YouTube.
[76:25.62]YouTube.com.
[76:26.74]The fucking site that I used to be on every fucking single day.
[76:31.30]They shit in that website's mouth a thousand times over the course of like four years.
[76:37.12]Who was getting a massage during that fucking YouTube debacle for like three years?
[76:43.03]Who was getting their fucking laundry massaged for Christ's sake?
[76:48.31]What's with the elephant behind me?
[76:54.76]Going off.
[76:56.50]This is, I'm just, I'm just, this is real.
[76:58.32]I'm just talking real.
[76:59.26]Like everyone wonders like, oh, why did you like ditch YouTube?
[77:01.56]Because they fucking pissed in the website's face.
[77:08.23]Even when I haven't been making a lot of videos for it.
[77:10.65]Even when I've been off it.
[77:12.89]The second channel, Holy Max was making highlights.
[77:17.92]And I'm like, damn, that's a really fucking cool thing.
[77:19.96]I like the idea...
[77:22.93]That these streams are long.
[77:24.67]They're, you know, three, four, five hours sometimes.
[77:27.19]Sometimes even longer than that, right?
[77:28.76]If it's the Karazhan stream, the worst stream ever, then obviously the worst stream I've ever done is the longest stream I've ever done.
[77:34.28]That's just how it works.
[77:37.86]I want people to be able to enjoy the streams without needing to have to be here the whole time.
[77:43.14]So, okay.
[77:44.02]Jerma, I don't... Excuse me.
[77:44.78]I got a fucking little frog in my throat.
[77:46.69]Jerma, I can't watch...
[77:48.41]the whole stream.
[77:49.59]I can't.
[77:50.27]It would be fun too, but I feel bad.
[77:52.45]I can't.
[77:53.39]Don't worry.
[77:54.23]I got you covered.
[77:54.89]I got you.
[77:55.73]There's going to be a 10 to 15, 8 minute highlight, kind of like the old style of videos that I used to make of the streams.
[78:04.37]And it's been going great.
[78:06.81]He's been doing a great fucking job.
[78:08.35]Those videos, I think, are really fun.
[78:09.90]They're really well put together.
[78:12.38]But YouTube as a whole, besides having those condensed videos...
[78:18.24]streams They like they always are messing around with like what they determined to be like views and The sub box like half the fucking time like is just getting changed.
[78:28.77]It doesn't work They're changing the home page all the time.
[78:32.35]They're pushing like random content like they it became a It became like you had to like game the system to like be able to do YouTube anymore and even now like you be talking about the um, I
[78:47.25]the like ads and shit they just came out with like a big thing where it was oh hey oh we have this new ad policy now where you're you be careful like your whole channel might just get fucking claimed and demonetized and whatever you've you've just worked your whole fucking life like uh but you're all adult life here we're just gonna close you potentially yeah it just was like I would rather do something fun
[79:14.22]I'd rather do something that, like, I think is fun and that I, like, would rather do.
[79:18.32]And streaming is that pretty much right now.
[79:21.32]I would rather stream than make a video on YouTube.
[79:24.61]As terrible as that is to say, it's just true.
[79:30.59]They did a series, and even still, like, Etalyx, right?
[79:33.05]You guys know Etalyx.
[79:34.41]He's told me, like, a dozen times, and he still makes videos, like, fucking three times a week.
[79:38.41]He still does it.
[79:38.96]He still grinds on fucking YouTube.
[79:41.04]And he'll tell me, like, oh, dude, yeah, like, the fucking sub box is broken today.
[79:44.72]Oh, like, views are all fucked up, like, this week.
[79:46.54]And it's like, it's... Like, if you're gonna make videos, like, don't you want to make sure that the people that are subscribed to you are, like, definitely going to see them pop up somewhere?
[79:55.84]It's just... That's fucking dumb.
[80:00.58]That's just... That just is dumb.
[80:03.15]And that's where I have the problem with YouTube.
[80:06.83]It's not YouTube, it's Google.
[80:07.87]Well, Google owns YouTube now.
[80:09.33]It's owned it for a long time.
[80:14.72]I'm ignoring questions in chat.
[80:16.16]Well, I just went off on like a tangent, so I apologize for that.
[80:20.28]Favorite film or director?
[80:21.50]The easy answer there is Christopher Nolan because obviously like the Batman movies are great.
[80:26.71]And like Inception is great.
[80:30.45]You know.
[80:31.57]Where do I keep my guitar?
[80:33.99]I smash it over my own head because I don't own one.
[80:37.53]Was that like a jab?
[80:39.01]Was that a jab at me?
[80:40.80]Was that a jab at me?
[80:42.00]Where's my guitar?
[80:42.62]Was that a jab at me?
[80:45.01]pretty good I I did see actually I saw dunkirk uh like last week I liked it I thought it was good I thought it was like there's not a whole lot of like any there's not a whole lot going on in dunkirk but the visuals and how they put the movie together is is really well done
[81:04.44]I like the sequences where you... Whatever.
[81:06.42]I don't want to give away spoilers.
[81:11.14]But the movie is put together in such a way that it keeps you interested the whole time.
[81:15.84]I didn't think I was... I wasn't bored at all watching Dunkirk.
[81:20.82]There's not really a lot going on in the movie besides that one area.
[81:25.60]I know the movie's called Dunkirk for a reason.
[81:30.30]But, you know.
[81:32.88]Am I into history?
[81:34.33]Not really.
[81:38.23]Spoilers.
[81:38.79]It happened.
[81:39.63]It was like a thing that happened like a hundred years ago.
[81:43.85]What do I hate more?
[81:44.45]Hiccups or sneezing?
[81:45.31]I like sneezing.
[81:46.15]Sneezing's fun.
[81:46.91]It feels good.
[81:47.79]Hiccups suck.
[81:48.37]It hurts.
[81:49.13]And they're annoying.
[81:50.01]Because you can like sneeze and then talk.
[81:52.87]You can't hiccup and talk.
[81:54.11]It's not enough.
[81:54.83]Sneezing feels great.
[81:56.01]I love sneezing.
[81:58.53]I've not gone to see the Emoji Movie.
[81:59.97]No.
[82:00.15]What's with the Emoji Movie?
[82:01.51]You guys are all into the Emoji Movie recently.
[82:03.69]What's going on here?
[82:04.99]Is that the thing now?
[82:13.46]Am I going to come to Germany for an event?
[82:17.70]Maybe.
[82:17.94]I don't know.
[82:21.30]I wish I had the time and money to be able to go anywhere I wanted in the world.
[82:24.57]I'm sure Germany would be on the list of places I would go.
[82:28.79]Europe as a whole would be fun.
[82:31.19]Not like backpacking through Europe, but going like this.
[82:35.31]Here's my travel plans for Europe if I ever go to Europe.
[82:38.55]Here's the map.
[82:38.99]Ready?
[82:39.71]Draw the map here.
[82:40.89]Can I draw?
[82:41.27]Can I draw on OBS?
[82:42.23]Can I?
[82:47.88]I think I can draw, right?
[82:51.96]No, I don't think I can.
[82:53.82]How do I draw?
[82:58.19]Image?
[82:58.83]No.
[83:00.01]Green screen?
[83:00.69]No.
[83:02.71]Shit, I can't.
[83:06.29]Open up MS Paint?
[83:06.97]Oh yeah, I could do that.
[83:07.57]Okay, here we go.
[83:09.17]Let's open up the program that's about to be deleted.
[83:11.21]Aren't they getting rid of paint forever?
[83:14.85]Alright, let me do this.
[83:19.63]So, one second.
[83:29.05]I gotta do this and then this.
[83:37.11]Is this gonna work?
[83:42.67]Gothic 3 is like still open somehow.
[83:45.05]How is that fucking possible?
[83:52.40]Move that out of the way.
[83:55.94]Now I'm in, like, the Twitch directory.
[83:59.06]Move that.
[83:59.74]Get out of my way, please.
[84:00.74]Now I'm in, like, the Twitch directory.
[84:05.35]How am I on my own stream?
[84:06.83]What the fuck is happening?
[84:12.99]Alright.
[84:13.41]So once this pops up, it would be wonderful, wouldn't it?
[84:24.79]There it is.
[84:29.37]No, it's not.
[84:29.89]What's going on here?
[84:30.83]Why can I not capture paint?

[85:02.27]Let's put the camera back on.
[85:08.85]I love, honestly, when I come back, I love the deer in headlights shit.
[85:11.85]It makes me laugh.
[85:14.60]Okay, so anyways.

[85:18.98]We're going to draw Europe here.

[85:26.08]Like that.
[85:28.08]Like this.
[85:28.88]There we go.

[85:44.93]Like, it's yellow.
[85:46.93]Here's where the plane comes in.
[85:48.91]This is Spain.

[85:53.41]We stop on England.
[85:55.64]We stop in London for like a couple of days.
[86:01.07]And then on the way out of London, we hit up Greece.
[86:06.23]Greece is right there.
[86:07.15]Wrap around to Italy.
[86:08.21]Come down to Italy all the way to the bottom of the boot.
[86:09.93]I want to see the bottom of the boot.
[86:11.14]You know what I mean?
[86:12.14]I want to piss off the bottom of the boot.
[86:14.34]We're going to be at the bottom of the boot in Italy for like at least a week.
[86:17.48]So we got like two days.
[86:19.36]We got one W here.
[86:20.52]One week.
[86:22.29]all the way wrapping around into this is Lithuania here I want to go to Lithuania for like at least a month I want to spend some time I want to learn the color learn the language I guess and then out of here all the way up to uh I mean I have some ancestry so I mean Ireland is a good place to stop and I'm going to stop in Ireland for maybe like a couple days like maybe two days
[86:49.02]And then we're going to go, we're going to take off.
[86:50.56]So here we go, like we take off from Ireland up to here.
[86:54.00]And here is Iceland.
[86:56.56]And we're going to, this is going to be blue because it's cold.

[87:57.72]I just want to do something else besides stream that.

[88:06.99]But I did name the countries that I wanted to go to.
