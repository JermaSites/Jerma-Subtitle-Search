[00:36.94]Good mornin', good mornin' Bet your bottom dollar that this mornin' There'll be sun Good mornin', good mornin' See the sun And the sorrow Till there's none Good mornin', good mornin' I love ya, good mornin' What's the, uh, how's that go?
[00:57.62]That's from Annie.
[01:01.50]Good mornin', good mornin' Bet your bottom dollar that good mornin'
[01:07.49]I don't know how it goes.
[01:09.83]I'll be right back.
[01:10.37]I'm going to grab a drink.
[01:11.46]And we're going to play Metro 2033.
[01:12.50]Cool.
[01:12.72]See you in a minute.
[03:15.81]So I got a weird, I got a weird message when I turned my computer on earlier.
[03:21.76]It was very strange.
[03:24.06]Any of you computer experts want to tell me what the fuck this means?
[03:26.94]Where are my headphones?
[03:32.89]Where the heck are my headphones, man?
[03:34.01]What the heck?
[03:35.67]Oh, there.
[03:35.89]Alright, so I boot up my computer like a regular good boy, right?
[03:41.53]And before it even posts to the BIOS, that's what it means.
[03:46.65]Before it even posted to Windows or whatever, it said, warning, USB overcurrent detected and turns the computer off.
[03:57.59]So I had to unplug like all of my USBs.
[03:59.68]And if I plug in my webcam or my keyboard, if my keyboard and my webcam are both plugged in at the same time, what does that mean?
[04:11.80]It's gonna short.
[04:15.72]I hope not.
[04:19.19]Go into your bios and lower it?
[04:20.53]Lower what?
[04:21.03]I don't even know what you want me to lower.
[04:24.51]Something's drawing too much power?
[04:26.69]How does that make any sense?
[04:27.43]I've had the same things plugged in for like months.
[04:35.01]Why now is it randomly like, oh, by the way, you're using too much power.
[04:39.98]That doesn't make any sense.
[04:45.49]I think your USB ports are going bad or shorting out.
[04:48.11]Well, that's not good.
[04:49.73]What's the PSU?
[04:52.03]800 watts, I think?
[04:53.68]It's a good one.
[04:54.32]It's like a... It was expensive.
[04:56.56]That's all I know.
[04:57.18]It was really fucking expensive.
[04:58.66]You know what I'm saying?
[05:00.52]Let me write... Let me write a Twitter.
[05:05.92]250 characters.
[05:06.96]I'm going to use them all.
[05:11.18]You guys ever notice that?
[05:12.90]Ever since they added the 240 characters, whatever.
[05:16.94]You don't gotta use them all.
[05:19.14]People think that every tweet now has to be 240 characters.
[05:24.36]Just because you're allowed to do it, doesn't mean you should do it every single tweet.
[05:32.00]Anyways.
[05:34.48]You're clogging up my feed.
[05:36.14]Let's see.
[05:40.02]Back to Metro.
[05:43.02]Did you hear?
[05:45.86]No, that's dumb.
[05:46.42]Just back to Metro.
[05:47.30]Who cares?
[05:50.96]I don't know why I always feel like every tweet that I make about my stream has to be funny or something.
[05:58.99]People just want to know if you're streaming right now.
[06:03.31]Why do I have to be so ironic and sarcastic every single time I do a Twitter about the stream being live?
[06:11.09]Just say what you're doing and just get on with it.
[06:13.41]I have plenty of comedy up in the brain that I can do for Twitter.
[06:16.29]It doesn't have to be when I'm talking about a stream.
[06:18.53]You know what I'm saying?
[06:24.00]Trying, like, so hard to be, like, an edgelord.
[06:26.62]Oh, no, I'm not like those other streamers.
[06:28.90]I wrote something weird today.
[06:30.60]Fucking shut up.
[06:34.85]Alright.
[06:36.69]Let's go like this.
[06:39.37]Over here.
[06:41.15]And hopefully we don't have the same problems we had before with Metro.
[06:47.07]I'm going to assume it'll be alright.
[06:48.27]Let's hope it's good to go.
[06:50.23]Is it good to go?
[06:55.43]Looks like it.
[06:56.71]Do not quit the game.
[06:57.53]But remember we had these weird issues with Metro where the frame rate was terrible.
[07:00.97]I think we're good now.
[07:05.66]Anyways, welcome.
[07:06.34]Hope everybody had a really good Christmas.
[07:13.74]And that's it.
[07:14.18]Let's go.
[07:15.92]Merry Christmas, everybody.
[07:17.42]Hey, thank you, Penny Kettle, for the $1.25.
[07:23.26]Christmas Dream was the highlight of my holiday.
[07:25.76]Love you, BB.
[07:26.41]By the way, please kill the memes and add new emotes.
[07:30.47]We will.
[07:31.69]That's a New Year thing.
[07:34.59]That's when we get closer to New Year's.
[07:37.73]Like the day or two after New Year's.
[07:42.50]This is kind of loud for me.
[07:46.52]Does anybody else?
[07:47.06]I don't know how I feel about the world.
[07:50.65]I feel like if I have loud noises in my ears, even if it's a medium level, that I can't do anything.
[07:58.19]Does anybody else have that problem?
[08:00.63]If I have two headphones in and people are talking and there's sounds, I'm a dead fish.
[08:06.87]I can't do anything.
[08:07.57]I can't even talk.
[08:10.58]Yeah, but people feel like that, right?
[08:16.86]Like this guy talking in my ear right now, I had to just stop and just stare because I can't talk to you guys.
[08:24.03]Is the Kill the Meme stream going to happen tomorrow?
[08:27.05]The Kill the Meme stream is going to happen when I deem it necessary.
[08:34.83]I forget everything that happened previously in this game.
[08:39.52]But we're going to do it anyways.
[08:40.39]Let's play.
[08:41.84]Let's lightning bolt these bits.
[08:43.32]By the way, because of the circumstances of the last stream, I was not able to thank anybody that gave bits.
[08:49.87]And some people gave a lot of money last stream.
[08:53.73]And I can't go through them all, obviously.
[08:57.31]But there were some huge money drops on that last stream.
[08:59.95]So thank you so much, everybody, that gave any money at all.
[09:04.40]It's never expected to see that kind of fucking amounts pop up on my screen.
[09:09.20]Um...
[09:10.10]I wish I could have gone through them all, but obviously I couldn't.
[09:12.83]There are reasons why I couldn't.
[09:16.86]Maybe you know.
[09:21.40]But yes, I am going to be going on trial.
[09:24.74]You guys are going to have to be there for that.
[09:27.88]I was told that the witnesses that were there for the previous stream are going to have to be there for the trial stream.
[09:40.47]I can't tell you when that's going to happen.
[09:42.13]I'm going to get summons in the mail.
[09:44.21]But you guys have to be there for that.
[09:45.57]I just want to make sure you guys know that.
[09:49.11]Wait, where did I go?
[09:50.33]Oh, down here.
[09:53.78]But I will tell you, I am hiring an exceptional lawyer.
[09:58.00]One of the best.
[10:01.91]Oh, there's an M down here.
[10:04.03]There's also bullets.
[10:05.67]Not a secret.
[10:06.47]Nice.
[10:06.97]Okay.
[10:10.53]You're gonna go to jail.
[10:13.96]Is there a reason why I can't get out of this hole?
[10:18.46]Get me out of here!
[10:20.62]Why can't I get out of here?
[10:23.05]Am I stuck in this hole for the rest of the game?
[10:27.47]Wait.
[10:30.17]No, okay, this is part of the game.
[10:31.42]Okay.
[10:35.86]It's alright.
[10:36.68]This is part of the video game.
[10:38.68]I'm gonna watch somebody die.
[10:40.38]I don't think I have any... Wait, no, no, no, no.
[10:44.44]Don't go yet.
[10:46.46]I don't have any bullets.
[10:47.15]I don't think I have any guns.
[10:50.33]Metro 2034.
[10:50.57]Metro 2034.
[10:54.28]Why are we going for a ride?
[10:55.47]Why am I being like a kid in a clothing store?
[10:59.99]I'm hiding in the rack of clothes and my mother's like pretending to not know where I am.
[11:03.75]Okay.
[11:03.97]Nope.
[11:22.08]That was fun.
[11:23.54]I'm glad I did that.
[11:24.32]What do you mean it's up to me now?
[11:29.47]Wait, what am I doing in here?
[11:30.65]This doesn't happen.
[11:31.53]Your mother doesn't like send you on a grand adventure when you're playing in the clothes rack in Target.
[11:37.33]Oh, God.
[11:37.79]I don't even know what I did.
[11:41.46]Don't forget to buy filters.
[11:42.70]I can't.
[11:43.34]You can't buy filters in Ranger mode, can you?
[11:50.14]I started like the next mission and I didn't even buy anything.
[12:01.45]I started the next part of the game and I didn't even buy anything.
[12:08.01]Not in this station.
[12:08.79]Okay.
[12:10.07]Can I look at my inventory?
[12:10.95]I can't even look at my inventory.
[12:16.62]This is 2033.
[12:16.94]This is 2033...
[12:21.93]redistributed.
[12:25.29]So I'm just being a stowaway, I get it.
[12:29.53]Yeah, you can't move in rager mode, you have to only look.
[12:35.85]I so badly want to throw a knife up there.
[12:42.61]You won't need anything if you use stealth.
[12:45.91]Yeah, you know, that's a good idea.
[12:47.17]I'm just gonna, I'm gonna use stealth.
[12:52.98]When am I going to do the surprise Metro Exodus stream?
[12:57.57]Well, first of all, I have to beat the game before it, which is Abe's Exodus.
[13:06.71]At least we got the... I don't want to do this again.
[13:09.46]Everyone's saying to go back.
[13:10.82]No, I'm not going to redo this.
[13:12.72]There's a lot of talking and a lot of dialogue here.
[13:16.02]It's the family tradition.
[13:17.32]So tell me, Lord.
[13:18.46]Is it also your tradition to lose arms and legs on the battlefield?
[13:21.44]Hey, Halberd.
[13:21.92]Thanks for the three bucks.
[13:22.68]Hey, Jeremiah.
[13:23.50]Been watching for almost four years.
[13:24.96]Really enjoy the stream.
[13:25.70]Thank you.
[13:26.20]Also, Discord, Lord.
[13:27.08]Thanks for the four dollars.
[13:28.30]Ass... Ass Seals... Ass Seals... Thank you, Ass Seals Seahorse for the five dollars.
[13:37.09]Thank you for the years of entertainment, Jeremiah.
[13:38.71]Where do you buy... Where did I bury Santa?
[13:42.55]Where did I buy Santa?
[13:45.27]I cannot talk about what happened last stream.
[13:48.93]I'm under three or four legal documents.
[13:52.80]So just when the trial happens, that's when you'll get some information that you're looking for.
[14:00.72]Thank you, Turian, for the $5.
[14:01.58]Have you seen my copy of Cloud Atlas?
[14:04.97]I don't know where it is.
[14:05.87]You probably misplaced it.
[14:10.01]Thank you to Stix Renegade for the $1.
[14:12.53]I saw that you wished Edna a happy birthday in the Xmas stream.
[14:15.69]My name isn't Edna.
[14:17.29]Well, Stix, I did tell you that we're going to wait until like January 4th.
[14:22.12]I'm going to surprise birthday party.
[14:23.36]Come on, man.
[14:26.96]Dragon Breath, thanks for the $1.
[14:28.26]Hey, Jerma found more ad money.
[14:31.03]I got a Cintiq tablet for Christmas and I want to draw some more fan art for you.
[14:35.41]Tell me exactly what you want to see in the fan art.
[14:37.23]I don't care how wacky your idea is.
[14:42.03]Me with a big growth on my face.
[14:44.95]And me sitting in a doctor's office.
[14:52.54]Was I supposed to do that?
[14:53.44]Is that it?
[15:00.28]Alright, that's it.
[15:03.01]Um... Oneyedredninja, thanks for the one dollar, and I can't see what you wrote, but thank you.
[15:11.46]Now, wait, do I have to kill?
[15:12.38]Alright, we're gonna do stealth.
[15:17.00]Can I crouch?
[15:18.78]Are these bad guys?
[15:19.98]What is my objective here?
[15:22.02]Do I have any bullets?
[15:23.98]I... Hold on a second.
[15:26.92]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[15:27.62]Let me pull up my, like, my fucking map.
[15:32.08]Get to Paulus.
[15:32.90]Find a ranger named Miller.
[15:34.82]Describe the station.
[15:36.62]Describe the situation at Exhibition.
[15:38.87]Cross the front line into the fascist territory.
[15:41.07]So we just gotta go.
[15:42.25]Okay.
[15:43.45]You could have just told me, just go.
[15:46.11]What, light?
[15:46.53]Flashlight off.
[15:47.79]Stealth.
[15:51.06]Alright, we got a Estes Soup over there on the right.
[15:52.86]Where's my knife?
[15:56.56]How do you use knife?
[15:58.51]I forget the controls, but it's alright.
[15:59.69]We're gonna knife this guy.
[16:01.65]No, we're not.
[16:02.05]Yes, we are.
[16:02.89]I gotta get up here.
[16:07.79]Anybody?
[16:08.05]Okay, we got... Oh, that was a... Wait, that was the guy.
[16:22.74]Was that the guy talking?
[16:25.75]I think that was the guy talking.
[16:28.57]Yeah.
[16:30.49]I almost got away with it, too.
[16:32.19]It wouldn't be you fucking meddling kid.
[16:39.10]So that was the guy talking.
[16:40.06]Alright, so we're going to sneak this way.
[16:42.04]Wait.
[16:43.86]What?
[16:45.32]What happened?
[16:46.58]What's going on?
[16:46.96]Why did they jump out this time?
[16:50.52]Are they looking for me now?
[16:51.74]I didn't... What?
[16:55.35]What is going on?
[16:57.33]Why are they already looking for me?
[16:58.77]I didn't... Why is this happening right now?
[17:10.47]I need to restart this.
[17:11.27]Just restart it.
[17:11.89]Like... They can smell the sin on you.
[17:16.22]Alright.
[17:18.30]Is it because I stood up?
[17:21.80]Whatever.
[17:23.58]Alright, let's just wait.
[17:25.26]We'll sneak around the right.
[17:26.14]That didn't happen last time.
[17:27.38]That was weird.
[17:27.80]Are these lockers?
[17:30.72]Can I open these?
[17:31.28]No.
[17:32.95]Okay, is there a way to... Should I go to the left?
[17:38.51]I can go down over there.
[17:39.51]Maybe I should go down.
[17:40.35]Okay, I'm going to go down.
[17:42.51]Is this guy going to turn around?
[17:46.09]Don't turn around.
[17:46.67]Stay that way.
[17:47.25]Okay.
[17:52.67]Oh shit, there's a guy right there.
[17:54.05]Oh fuck.
[17:54.86]Oh my god.
[17:56.40]Oh my god.
[17:57.46]Oh my god, there's two guys here.
[17:58.82]Oh my god, go.
[18:00.90]How did I get through that?
[18:02.22]I can't even see any other people.
[18:03.78]This way?
[18:04.86]Which way?
[18:05.28]This way.
[18:08.06]Somebody's shooting.
[18:08.60]Who's shooting now?
[18:09.80]Oh god.
[18:13.06]Imagine if... Alright, can you imagine if this was me actually talking right now in the game?
[18:19.48]What's going on?
[18:19.90]Oh, they're there?
[18:20.48]Oh my god.
[18:20.96]I'm stealthing.
[18:21.56]Where do I go?
[18:23.08]That would be seen.
[18:23.58]That would be spotted in a second.
[18:24.78]Alright, calm down right here.
[18:25.72]I made it.
[18:26.64]I made it.
[18:26.96]I made it.
[18:31.47]Got a save point right here?
[18:33.59]Yeah, we do.
[18:37.29]There's gunfire and all this crazy stuff going on here.
[18:40.81]Oh, wait a minute.
[18:41.33]Wait a minute.
[18:41.75]Wait a minute.
[18:42.39]Save this guy.
[18:42.77]Save this guy.
[18:43.35]Save this guy.
[18:44.11]Should I save this guy?
[18:55.76]Saved him.
[18:56.78]Alright.
[18:59.58]Can you do anything for me?
[19:03.48]No, he's not going to do anything for me.
[19:04.66]Why?
[19:05.00]What?
[19:08.76]Come on, this guy doesn't have any dialogue.
[19:10.02]He's just in like... This guy's just in the basis from the Gorillas when they went on the live tour.
[19:19.10]What was that guy's name?
[19:19.86]Paul Simenon.
[19:21.05]Look it up.
[19:21.41]Look up Paul Simenon Gorillas Tour 2011.
[19:30.60]So this guy did nothing for me.
[19:33.26]Doesn't even have any ammo or bullets or anything.
[19:38.08]Whatever.
[19:39.10]Like, I want to kill this guy.
[19:40.14]He won't let me.
[19:47.24]No, I can't.
[19:48.02]What a waste of time.
[19:49.10]So, can I drop down here?
[19:51.88]I think I can.
[19:52.50]I think we're just going to have to, like, parkour down here now.
[20:01.56]Straight down.
[20:03.04]Look for items.
[20:03.64]Look for stuff.
[20:06.44]No, we're going to jump from here to there.
[20:09.20]And we should be good to go.
[20:10.81]One, two, three.
[20:12.41]Oh my god, the jump.
[20:13.41]I swear to god, the jump.
[20:14.41]There's no forward momentum in this game.
[20:16.95]Like, when you jump and you let go of W, you just sit there like a sack of cement that falls.
[20:23.21]There's no forward momentum.
[20:25.26]Where's the forward momentum?
[20:26.50]Oh.
[20:32.52]Like, a whole W?
[20:33.80]No, I should have the forward momentum.
[20:38.83]Okay.
[20:41.87]Looking good so far.
[20:43.21]With the GPS straight ahead.
[20:46.49]Right here.
[20:50.11]Okay, we're good.
[20:51.35]Let's heal up.
[20:55.60]And that puts us in a decent position.
[20:59.58]I can go right here.
[21:00.22]Okay.
[21:01.40]Okay.
[21:03.96]Oh, shit.
[21:04.24]I need the gas mask, don't I?
[21:05.80]Do I need the gas mask?
[21:06.52]What do you got?
[21:11.67]What do you got?
[21:12.07]Come on.
[21:12.59]I need the gas mask, dude.
[21:13.77]Like, right now.
[21:16.89]Okay, there we go.
[21:18.53]You got anything else on you?
[21:25.00]Now, don't sprint.
[21:25.52]I was told not to sprint.
[21:29.88]So, I'm just gonna make it through.
[21:33.55]Anything in the bones?
[21:36.63]No, nothing so far.
[21:37.57]We're good.
[21:38.09]Just keep going.
[21:38.97]Watch out for the poison.
[21:41.09]Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[21:47.28]Just keep going.
[21:48.50]Wait, I need to examine things.
[21:54.72]Where am I going from here?
[21:55.94]Straight ahead.
[21:56.57]You got it.
[21:59.65]Oh god, turn the light off, turn the light off.
[22:06.95]Am I supposed to be down here?
[22:08.75]Did I do something wrong?
[22:12.29]Fucking god.
[22:22.24]Wait, wait.
[22:24.58]Okay, yeah.
[22:25.38]Good thing there was a save point right there.
[22:30.04]Don't take the gas mask off, you dummy.
[22:33.58]Where is it?
[22:34.38]I want to take it.
[22:36.40]Put the gas mask back on.
[22:37.66]I can't even put the gas mask back on.
[22:39.02]I'm going to die down here.
[22:43.40]I'm dead down here.
[22:48.51]Get me out of here.
[22:49.03]Come on.
[22:50.71]Oh, shit.
[22:51.31]No.
[22:53.65]I can't put this.
[22:54.43]I don't have any more gas filters.
[22:56.59]Go, go.
[23:00.76]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[23:06.01]What?
[23:06.97]What?
[23:07.29]What is this?
[23:07.89]What is this?
[23:09.37]What?
[23:09.75]Go.
[23:09.87]Get up there.
[23:12.57]Out of the gas.
[23:16.33]Made it.
[23:18.61]You guys don't have any faith at all.
[23:27.66]That was the... I'm going to call that one the Jeremy skip.
[23:34.38]Oh, shit.
[23:38.97]Okay.
[23:40.05]Anywhere else to go?
[23:46.25]What's... Okay.
[23:49.37]These are prisoners.
[23:49.93]I'm going to be able to save... Alright.
[23:53.53]Shh.
[23:54.39]Don't say anything.
[23:57.04]He doesn't know I'm behind him.
[23:58.12]Saved.
[23:58.54]What about the subtitles?
[24:03.87]Where are the subtitles?
[24:05.29]Alright, so you guys got any gas mask filters?
[24:07.95]Anybody got one I could borrow?
[24:09.15]Maybe?
[24:09.35]I'm not gonna shoot these guys.
[24:10.37]These are my comrades.
[24:26.77]But I really could use one gas mask filter.
[24:30.35]And what do you know?
[24:31.45]Bingo!
[24:32.21]They have gas mask filters right here.
[24:35.13]Right?
[24:35.87]Yeah.
[24:36.13]Okay.
[24:36.47]Take it off.
[24:37.27]I just want to make sure that's what it was.
[24:40.86]Anything else in here we can steal?
[24:41.88]No.
[24:44.00]There's a Boba Fett mask.
[24:47.08]Nothing else, it seems.
[24:48.34]What about the locker?
[24:50.92]No, this is just like a weird outhouse.
[24:52.64]I keep turning that off.
[24:54.46]There's nothing on this table.
[24:55.47]Are you kidding me?
[24:56.75]You don't have anything?
[25:02.19]Those look like bullets.
[25:05.99]There's no subtitles in Ranger mode.
[25:07.53]Alright, are we going to kill the power here?
[25:12.82]Should I have done that?
[25:13.38]I don't know if I should have done that.
[25:20.40]I feel like that was a bad move.
[25:25.10]Now there's gunfire.
[25:26.30]Great.
[25:33.38]I'm so scared to go up here.
[25:36.08]I just killed the lights and the whole complex.
[25:38.36]Why would anybody not be running around looking for someone?
[25:47.38]At least I do have a good opportunity for stealth here.
[25:51.04]Save point.
[25:52.38]Perfect.
[25:54.81]Which way do I gotta go?
[25:55.55]Left or right?
[25:56.03]I'm gonna go this way.
[25:57.89]I'm gonna wait for this guy to turn around.
[26:00.53]Or should I just say... Shibuya-cho and... Alright, that didn't work.
[26:09.03]I thought it was gonna explode!
[26:10.85]I thought it was gonna explode.
[26:12.37]I really did.
[26:12.97]I really thought it was gonna explode.
[26:14.63]Barrels don't just not explode in video games.
[26:18.38]Just get rid of me.
[26:19.96]Just do it.
[26:20.48]Get rid of me.
[26:26.28]Those are clearly propane tanks.
[26:30.62]They just don't explode.
[26:31.62]That's fine.
[26:32.22]I'll see you guys in Shibuya-cho, okay?
[26:39.27]I'm gonna hide in that little corridor over there.
[26:44.86]Have you forgot the red barrel rule?
[26:46.42]No, I know what the red barrel rule is, but have you also forgotten the propane tank in every video game rule?
[26:53.62]Oh, there's a guy coming.
[26:56.24]Maybe he won't see me.
[27:06.77]That was so unnecessary.
[27:10.27]Can this guy turn around?
[27:11.41]So I can... God!
[27:12.27]God!
[27:15.64]Do they see bodies?
[27:16.42]Is this like Hitman?
[27:18.40]Oh, no.
[27:21.36]Oh, no.
[27:22.19]I have a throwing knife, right?
[27:23.25]Yep.
[27:24.07]Okay.
[27:24.57]I gotta be good here.
[27:25.11]Gotta be good.
[27:25.51]Good, good, good.
[27:26.15]Be good.
[27:26.53]Be good!
[27:28.25]Good.
[27:31.07]Good.
[27:34.25]That guy's not gonna walk over here, is he?
[27:44.69]Okay.
[27:45.57]Keep going.
[27:45.87]I don't... I feel like... I feel like if this was here, it would want me to be going down here.
[27:52.65]So that's what I'm gonna do.
[27:54.05]Now this... I need gas mask down there.
[27:55.83]I need to save my gas mask.
[27:59.79]Right?
[28:00.00]I need to save my gas mask.
[28:02.50]I'm not going that way.
[28:03.92]At least not yet.
[28:05.34]I only have like one filter.
[28:12.69]No noises.
[28:14.03]Nothing.
[28:14.31]No sudden movements.
[28:20.58]You don't need a gas mask to go down there.
[28:23.02]Oh boy.
[28:23.54]Oh boy.
[28:23.92]Oh boy.
[28:24.28]Oh boy.
[28:24.54]Watch out for the droid.
[28:28.94]Shit.
[28:29.34]God damn it.
[28:30.00]What am I thinking?
[28:31.62]Oh, I was trying to go for like a PogChamp moment.
[28:33.50]Let me get that back.
[28:37.54]Where's that knife?
[28:39.06]There it is.
[28:41.94]Okay, we're fine.
[28:44.72]Dude, I was going for a straight up PogChamp moment.
[28:48.04]You know what I mean?
[28:50.88]That would have been on twitchclips.org in about 25 seconds.
[29:00.05]I was told don't sprint.
[29:01.31]But what is that looking at me from all the way down there?
[29:04.94]Is that another buggy?
[29:06.18]It is, isn't it?
[29:06.88]Oh, God.
[29:08.28]Is it coming down this road?
[29:09.70]What is it?
[29:10.10]I can't see it.
[29:12.58]That's a kind of motorcycle.
[29:14.35]What happened?
[29:27.19]What?
[29:30.61]What?
[29:31.01]What?
[29:31.79]What?
[29:37.49]What happened?
[29:38.78]The game just didn't like what I was doing?
[29:40.48]Fuck it.
[29:50.58]Why did... Where's the other guy?
[29:58.81]Okay, see... What?
[30:04.16]I don't understand.
[30:05.98]Did I get backstabbed by the train?
[30:08.30]Am I gonna... Is it gonna hit me?
[30:10.28]Is this like Dark Souls?
[30:11.48]Where I could, like, be...
[30:16.76]Oh, they're gonna know he's dead.
[30:17.90]Oh, shit.
[30:20.56]Oh, come on!
[30:26.32]Wait, he comes back?
[30:27.22]The guy's not even alive!
[30:28.66]The guy's not even alive.
[30:29.83]The guy's dead.
[30:31.29]He can't control the train.
[30:32.69]What?!
[30:40.91]Huh?
[30:42.13]Wait, is he getting in the train?
[30:43.85]No, he's not.
[30:57.04]Okay, let's go ahead and uh... This game is great.
[31:02.71]Let's backstab this guy.
[31:03.89]No more messing around.
[31:04.79]We're gonna get the 1, 2, we're gonna get the items.
[31:07.71]Watch this.
[31:09.80]Why did that fail?
[31:13.08]That shouldn't have failed.
[31:13.84]Wait, I've got documents here.
[31:15.50]What's in the documents?
[31:17.62]Documents.
[31:18.54]Come on, I want the documents.
[31:20.50]Pick up the documents.
[31:23.53]No, I don't want this gun.
[31:25.45]Oh, my God.
[31:25.89]I just loaded up the... That's what I wanted to pick up.
[31:29.05]Oh, God damn it.
[31:29.75]I just loaded the guy's gun for him and put it back down.
[31:31.89]He's dead.
[31:37.64]Give me a break.
[31:39.82]Hey, hey.
[31:40.22]I hope you like the gun.
[31:42.18]I just gave you more ammo, dead guy.
[31:49.37]Turn this off, too.
[31:51.19]Shut these off.
[31:52.03]Shut these all off.
[31:54.01]Okay, here it comes.
[31:56.03]Hide right here.
[31:58.17]Wait till he goes by.
[32:04.86]Come on, you stupid droid.
[32:06.12]Get out of here.
[32:07.66]So he comes back.
[32:08.44]He goes in reverse.
[32:12.30]How is he even seeing behind him?
[32:13.86]But what is that?
[32:15.12]There's a guy right here.
[32:17.86]I need to knife this guy from across the whole map, right?
[32:20.52]That's what's going to have to happen.
[32:21.68]The droid's coming back.
[32:22.24]Droid's coming back.
[32:24.94]Right?
[32:26.88]I have to knife that guy.
[32:27.64]He's not coming back yet.
[32:31.18]Are you guys certain that's what killed me?
[32:33.42]Because he still hasn't come back yet, and I died already at this point.
[32:35.98]Alright, we're gonna tomahawk this guy.
[32:50.11]OH SHIT!
[32:53.48]I'm not in his line of sight.
[32:54.32]Not in his line of sight.
[33:03.08]If I was running with him, I was not in his line of sight.
[33:13.62]Okay, keep that in mind, guys.
[33:14.76]As long as you're out of his cone, he can't see you.
[33:21.72]How am I supposed to... I have to, like, go all the way down here, don't I?
[33:24.16]Yeah, probably.
[33:29.78]I can't just, like, peek up.
[33:30.78]That's a bad idea.
[33:32.70]Alright.
[33:33.39]Let's go.
[33:36.47]Is there anywhere else for me to go?
[33:37.57]No, no, no.
[33:38.23]He's not looking this way.
[33:39.05]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[33:39.93]Right, right, right, right, right.
[33:40.57]Okay, right here.
[33:42.16]I'm going to wait for him to... No, where are my tomahawks?
[33:44.74]Right here.
[33:45.60]Tomahawk one.
[33:46.25]Tomahawk two.
[33:47.03]Tomahawk three.
[33:48.47]We're good.
[33:49.03]Oh, no, we're not good.
[33:49.77]He's going to see me.
[33:50.89]Oh, no.
[33:51.21]Back here.
[33:52.71]Right?
[33:53.35]I'm going to get seen here, too.
[33:56.33]What is this?
[33:57.01]Knife?
[33:57.19]Oh, he's going to see me.
[33:58.07]He's going to see me.
[33:59.13]I've got to go back.
[34:03.78]Oh, my God.
[34:04.56]Okay, we're fine.
[34:05.08]Right here.
[34:06.40]Wait for him to come, and then wait for him to come again.
[34:14.76]I'm so paranoid about this stupid thing.
[34:21.37]Why is this guy going back and forth?
[34:26.91]Turn up the brightness?
[34:27.67]Well, it's just because I don't have my flashlight on.
[34:29.09]That's why you can't see anything.
[34:30.56]But I'm playing a stealth playthrough, so I have to make sure it's there.
[34:38.19]Hey, thank you, Smokey, for the one dollar.
[34:39.51]Jerma, how much do I have to pay to get you to make an announcement on your old Steam group that just says poop?
[34:46.35]I don't even know, like... Wow.
[34:47.61]My old Steam group.
[34:50.33]You don't have to pay me anything.
[34:52.55]Thank you, Smokey.
[34:53.21]Thank you, Killganon, for the one dollar as well.
[34:54.61]Jerma's streaming from a secret... Hold on.
[34:58.74]Okay, I have... They gave me these knives for a reason.
[35:00.80]I have to knife this guy.
[35:02.66]Get it right this time.
[35:08.12]Alright, I gotta right the shin.
[35:09.52]That means I win.
[35:11.64]The arc on these are weird.
[35:13.15]The arc's a little weird.
[35:16.45]Alright, don't fuck this up.
[35:17.67]I got one chance here before the car comes back.
[35:19.65]Which way am I going?
[35:20.31]Any people, any people, any people.
[35:21.73]I don't know.
[35:22.97]Oh god.
[35:24.04]Up that way.
[35:24.60]Up the ladder?
[35:25.14]Up the ladder.
[35:25.52]We're going up the ladder.
[35:26.14]I'm gonna turn this off.
[35:31.02]Somebody up here?
[35:32.36]Nope.
[35:32.66]We're good.
[35:34.10]Just take a second.
[35:38.39]Mom, get the camera.
[35:42.59]What a classic internet reference.
[35:45.45]You know what I'm saying?
[35:48.97]That guy can see me, I think.
[35:52.87]Well, we're going to find out.
[35:53.57]I might just be Spider-Man up here and not be able to get seen.
[35:57.79]Which, that would work out, wouldn't it?
[36:00.71]Turn off all these light jugs.
[36:04.58]Just in case.
[36:06.20]Nothing over there, nothing over there.
[36:07.56]What do you mean he won't look up?
[36:13.40]Oh, you're talking about that guy, not me.
[36:17.44]Alright, we got some stuff here.
[36:18.72]We got, ooh.
[36:21.16]What is that?
[36:22.08]Let's just take a look at it.
[36:24.06]What is this thing?
[36:26.25]This thing's a, this, what is this thing?
[36:28.53]Damn, this thing's got like a little sight on it.
[36:30.19]I think I want this.
[36:30.95]What's better?
[36:33.47]This thing's dumb.
[36:34.79]I don't want this thing.
[36:35.85]I want this thing instead of this thing.
[36:39.72]The scope on that, I mean, I put the scope on there, but what are you doing?
[36:42.86]No, no, no, don't put... No, no, no, no.
[36:44.54]Okay, so we are going to take this.
[36:45.68]I'm not going to shoot to try it.
[36:54.99]The AK is better?
[36:57.87]That's a bastard gun.
[36:59.05]Don't take that thing.
[37:00.81]Why?
[37:01.01]Why?
[37:04.09]Can I take the scope off?
[37:06.43]I don't think I can take the scope off.
[37:10.75]The AK is better than the battery shooter, is it?
[37:16.14]Well, alright, fine.
[37:17.08]Give me the regular... No, I want the regular bullets.
[37:22.62]Get these things off, please.
[37:24.02]I can't even tell if the regular bullets are even in.
[37:27.30]I think this is shooting the good bullets.
[37:35.62]Wait, it's suppressed.
[37:36.36]This gun is suppressed, guys.
[37:37.74]I'm taking this.
[37:38.58]Yep.
[37:44.24]Battery gun is silenced, everybody.
[37:45.78]We're taking the battery gun.
[37:49.48]And I'm going to keep the sniper shotgun.
[37:54.84]Okay.
[37:57.00]It took a little bit of deliberation, but I think I got it.
[37:58.72]There we go.
[38:06.12]What's going on?
[38:08.88]Did somebody hear me do that?
[38:10.90]Well, I have full... Why do I need these?
[38:16.02]I think somebody saw the light.
[38:18.23]That's fine.
[38:20.51]Yeah, I'm gonna be like as silent as a... I'm gonna be as silent as a battery.
[38:29.31]Go.
[38:30.25]What are you doing?
[38:32.35]Why am I going this slow down the ladder?
[38:41.53]Check this out.
[38:44.04]We got a save point right here.
[38:45.28]Let's see how good this gun is.
[38:46.38]Oh, don't take the gun!
[38:48.76]Don't take that gun!
[38:49.58]That gun's stupid!
[38:51.56]Take the AK!
[38:52.32]Take the loud, impossible-to-control AK-47.
[38:57.57]I just hit that guy in the back of the head with a AA battery.
[39:01.53]He's dead instantly.
[39:22.15]How does that guy know where I am?
[39:25.05]How do you know where I am?
[39:25.89]How would you even know that?
[39:26.75]How would he know where I am?
[39:31.73]We got the save point right there.
[39:32.67]I wanted to prove to you guys that the battery gun is superior.
[39:36.30]Watch.
[39:36.58]Superior battery gun.
[39:40.66]I gotta get people in the head.
[40:02.62]Don't take the battery gun, Jeremy!
[40:04.40]Don't do it!
[40:07.99]Whoa, what?
[40:09.53]What's going on?
[40:11.81]Why am I on the wall?
[40:12.57]Give me all your shit.
[40:29.05]Anybody else?
[40:29.63]We got some more shit around here.
[40:31.29]I can hear another voice.
[40:33.13]Let's get dark.
[40:45.36]One more, two more bodies down here.
[40:46.50]Yep.
[40:48.62]Took his backpack.
[40:52.02]There's that one guy up there, but that's alright.
[40:55.14]We don't need to deal with that dude.
[40:58.26]I'm going into the car.
[41:14.46]There's somebody on the battery gun, Jeremy!
[41:30.24]Let's get this thing moving!
[41:36.26]Where do I need to go?
[41:36.86]I guess this way.
[41:41.89]I am getting a lot of stuff, that is a good thing.
[41:49.31]What else is in this car?
[41:53.93]Up there?
[41:54.71]No, we're gonna go all the way to the back first.
[41:58.66]Safe.
[41:59.66]I can't open it.
[42:00.22]I don't have a key.
[42:01.26]Damn it.
[42:02.88]Oh, that sucks.
[42:06.96]Oh, well.
[42:12.56]Um, what does it want me to do here?
[42:13.92]Should I go back up?
[42:16.22]I think I have to go, like, up and around.
[42:19.38]Yeah, I do.
[42:26.74]That guy's still there.
[42:28.43]No, I got these guys already.
[42:29.45]So, what?
[42:29.75]It wants me to go back here?
[42:30.69]I guess.
[42:36.34]Watch out for that.
[42:37.24]Watch out for that guy.
[42:41.68]The key is in the front of the train.
[42:43.08]Alright, I'll get the key.
[42:47.50]Hold on, everybody.
[42:48.26]Calm down.
[42:50.66]Gotta wait for this guy to leave.
[42:53.50]Eat my ass, Jerma.
[42:54.88]No, thanks.
[43:04.75]The key is in the front of the train.
[43:09.03]Well, it was so dark I couldn't see.
[43:10.66]How was I supposed to see?
[43:14.62]Why would the key to the safe be in the front of the car?
[43:16.70]Alright, let's see what's in there.
[43:20.64]And... Ooh, we got an old lunchbox.
[43:24.62]I don't even know what it was.
[43:26.48]It was an old lunchbox.
[43:30.38]Back to it.
[43:34.71]You should do coke on stream.
[43:38.53]What you meant to say is you should do coke never in your life.
[43:42.77]That's the correct thing to say.
[43:44.27]Am I going up this fucking ladder?
[43:47.49]Back down.
[43:57.77]You know what I'm saying?
[43:59.15]Don't be an idiot.
[44:04.93]Where did this come from?
[44:07.17]Don't be an idiot, okay?
[44:09.33]Don't listen to your friends.
[44:10.30]Your friend's not cool.
[44:11.92]Don't be an idiot.
[44:14.50]Hey, pick up a goddamn textbook.
[44:19.16]Put down the white bag.
[44:21.82]Don't do it.
[44:22.48]Don't be an idiot.
[44:26.50]What am I looking for?
[44:34.44]I'm hearing the Metal Gear Solid, Somebody Saw You music.
[44:37.12]Why?
[44:37.32]Alright, we're going to... Rappahanna.
[44:50.15]Katahua.
[44:53.84]Ooh, new gun.
[44:54.78]What's this one?
[44:56.54]Looks like a big shotgun.
[44:57.78]Nope, we're not...
[45:08.06]I thought I disappeared that guy.
[45:10.84]Dude, can we stop doing the library joke?
[45:26.82]God damn it.
[45:27.42]How am I supposed to know these guys are even in here?
[45:29.10]I'm okay.
[45:30.62]I'm fine.
[45:33.88]You know like in those romantic comedies where the guy and the girl are on opposite sides of the aisle in the library?
[45:40.90]And they're picking up different books and they're seeing each other through the books?
[45:44.23]That's what we were just doing, except with guns.
[45:54.73]I should've asked that guy to go to coffee later.
[46:00.46]More documents.
[46:02.46]more healing.
[46:02.94]I'm just gonna heal and then use it.
[46:04.98]Why not?
[46:05.38]It's free.
[46:09.88]Uh, whoa.
[46:11.32]Yikes.
[46:13.52]Pretty cool Bloodborne room.
[46:16.58]What's over here?
[46:18.25]I need to, like, charge this thing.
[46:19.29]How do I?
[46:19.67]Yeah, like this.
[46:25.99]Nice.
[46:27.45]Nice and bright.
[46:29.21]Nope, not that way.
[46:36.95]Anything else?
[46:38.37]Dirty soap.
[46:39.63]And this is where we leave.
[46:40.57]We're going to go to Seton, Nopoxo, Thranpoa.
[46:46.68]Looking forward to it.
[46:47.84]I've always wanted to visit there.
[46:57.46]Any items to take?
[46:58.96]No?
[47:05.94]I love me reading russian are like places like in Hawaii oh let's go to uh oahu a poco hey oh the come on this is way too low
[47:36.92]So the Nazis got me.
[47:38.58]Why should we hesitate?
[47:40.22]Let's shoot this red spy and be done with it.
[47:44.11]These guys have bugs.
[47:46.97]Shouldn't we call the Gestapo?
[47:50.47]It'll take them forever to get here from right.
[47:53.09]We'll watch this pig till then.
[47:54.73]When do I get to kill the Star Wars characters?
[47:57.96]Just waiting for that guy to hold up a stick and go like... Oh, come on.
[48:05.89]Boop!
[48:06.23]Boop!
[48:07.91]Ready?
[48:08.25]Boop!
[48:08.35]Boop!
[48:37.52]Huh?
[48:38.78]Why?
[48:39.84]Why would you put us all in that much danger to do a cool action movie move?
[48:46.79]You know, one thing I like about the bad guys, there's always a lot of discussion before they get around to pulling the trigger.
[48:52.31]It's true.
[48:53.31]That's true.
[48:54.01]That's a good line.
[49:02.67]Oh, where are the... Snapda.
[49:06.97]Situation normal.
[49:07.75]All pertaining to atrocities.
[49:09.41]Situation normal.
[49:10.32]Ah.
[49:10.42]I don't know.
[49:10.90]Bang.
[49:11.42]This is a double agent.
[49:13.22]Double agent.
[49:14.54]And another double agent.
[49:37.50]Armored car?
[49:38.80]Armored... No, we're gonna go in the caramel car?
[49:41.58]Why can I not say this?
[49:42.78]Armored... Why can I not say this word?
[49:46.26]Armored... Armored car.
[49:52.48]Arnold Palmer.
[49:55.29]Yes, we're going to give him an Arnold Palmer to make sure he gets plus 25 HP.
[49:58.87]Oh, we get to go in this thing.
[50:05.95]We get to go in the droid.
[50:14.87]Thank you.
[50:21.61]That's my health potion of choice.
[50:25.59]That's the best drink that's ever existed.
[50:29.45]Half iced tea, half lemonade.
[50:31.83]It's perfect.
[50:33.87]I could drink that for the rest of my life and be okay with it.
[50:36.07]If you replaced water with Arnold Palmer's,
[50:40.08]That's fine.
[50:40.44]I'll take a shower with it, too.
[50:41.70]That's fine.
[50:44.73]Why can I not go left and right with this?
[50:48.63]Oh.
[50:50.37]You have to use A and D to move left and right.
[50:57.27]And it's inverted.
[50:59.11]Oh, boy.
[51:00.03]It's inverted, too?
[51:01.87]This is not easy.
[51:02.47]This is going to be hard.
[51:03.83]A and D, left and right.
[51:06.28]Inverted mouse.
[51:10.56]Oh my god, I'm gonna lose so hard.
[51:15.20]E. That is it?
[51:17.62]I pressed the horn.
[51:18.32]Okay, that's how you press... Why am I pressing the... Why am I doing this?
[51:26.12]Oh, I do wanna... Okay.
[51:30.65]Are these bad guys?
[51:31.35]I don't know.
[51:33.75]I think they're bad guys.
[51:34.51]Yeah, they are.
[51:38.01]Should we not shoot yet?
[51:38.79]I think we're supposed to be sneaking through this.
[51:42.33]I guess.
[51:42.63]Oh, no.
[51:47.09]Uh-oh.
[51:48.07]I can't shoot yet.
[51:48.71]Uh-oh.
[52:01.57]Come on, get in a collateral position I feel like I didn't do much I gotta turn all the way behind Are you still alive?
[52:30.31]Oh my god, this is gonna be so hard.
[52:32.15]Dude, I shot that guy in the face like 500 times.
[52:37.89]What?
[52:43.43]Which way are we going?
[52:47.14]Behind?
[52:47.40]Are there people behind us?
[52:48.22]Oh my lord, of course there are.
[52:54.86]We just blow them up, that's fine.
[52:57.44]That works.
[53:00.45]Yep.
[53:06.61]Just do the GTA tactic and just shoot until the car explodes.
[53:12.51]Anybody else?
[53:13.92]How am I on health?
[53:14.60]What?
[53:14.80]What do you mean left?
[53:19.30]Where is he?
[53:21.20]Oh, they're over there.
[53:22.32]Oh my god.
[53:24.24]I saw...
[53:29.27]What are we crashing into?
[53:30.57]Can anybody else see what's happening right now?
[53:35.17]Because I don't know, and I'm surrounded by red barrels.
[53:42.77]I wish this guy would stop moving.
[53:44.20]Stop moving the car.
[53:51.14]I'm just shooting the lights.
[53:52.14]I just killed the car to the left of me.
[53:58.67]I appreciate the fact that you're making this as hard as a midway game.
[54:02.84]Oh my god, I'm out of bullets.
[54:04.00]No, I'm not.
[54:16.08]Hey, am I doing a good job?
[54:18.19]Is it hard for you to fucking shoot?
[54:21.73]Maybe if I go back and forth a few more times you'll have more problems shooting the gun.
[54:34.47]I can't heal either.
[54:39.44]That was a bad accent.
[54:40.66]I'm in the middle of doing something.
[54:41.98]I can't do an accent and play the game at the same time.
[54:47.53]Great Russian accent.
[54:52.19]Where?
[54:53.14]Right there.
[54:54.26]Oh no.
[55:02.53]So it's a homing spiral gun.
[55:09.87]That was a nice contra weapon that guy had.
[55:11.67]Alright, we're okay.
[55:14.23]It was scripted.
[55:18.11]Is he dead?
[55:20.29]I think this guy's dead.
[55:24.31]Yeah, he is.
[55:26.21]Why do I hear Darth Vader?
[55:30.31]What's...
[55:34.25]Okay.
[55:35.51]Hey, surprise, it's your birthday.
[55:37.49]What the hell was that?
[55:38.27]Everybody, keep the lights off, keep the lights off.
[55:45.57]Wait for him to come in a little further.
[55:46.81]I don't have my iPhone out yet.
[55:50.02]Oh my god.
[56:01.08]I feel like I ain't doing much here.
[56:04.51]Whoa, easy.
[56:05.55]Guy?
[56:07.57]Yeah, guy.
[56:12.56]I know, I'm currently aiming that way, I think.
[56:20.66]Come on, just get out of here.
[56:23.39]Oh my god, damn it!
[56:36.80]Is he dead?
[56:37.30]I'm going to overheat my gun.
[56:52.45]I can't see, I know.
[56:53.91]It's very hard to see.
[56:54.85]We're going to go that way.
[56:55.51]Shoot through the hoop.
[56:57.59]Nice.
[57:00.92]Ow.
[57:01.62]Alright, get out.
[57:05.51]I love how I beeped it and it got out of the way.
[57:10.75]That's right.
[57:11.77]It's my road.
[57:28.25]Ah!
[57:34.82]Are you alright?
[57:36.58]Yes.
[57:41.02]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[57:43.04]Wait.
[57:43.72]Items.
[57:44.32]Are there items in here?
[57:45.44]Nope.
[57:45.72]No items.
[57:46.28]Let's go.
[57:50.55]What happened to the other guy?
[57:51.47]The guy that had the superpowers.
[57:52.81]I kind of want that guy.
[57:53.63]Not this random dude that's going to absolutely get shot in about five seconds.
[58:09.09]Not one for conversations, are we?
[58:13.88]Okay.
[58:20.12]Is there an entire Vader outfit in here?
[58:21.98]I hope so.
[58:25.41]After a firefight with the Nazi trolls, it seemed we would have an easy road ahead.
[58:33.51]Wait!
[58:39.43]Battery gun or scoped shotgun?
[58:42.47]What?
[58:42.61]Duck.
[58:42.95]I didn't know what he was talking about.
[58:54.71]I'm like looking at the chat over here.
[58:57.27]Oh my lord.
[59:07.37]Well, let's put on some of these incendiary grenades.
[59:13.38]You didn't duck.
[59:14.06]Well, that's the first time I've had to duck in the game.
[59:19.26]I see a guy.
[59:21.02]I see a guy.
[59:22.40]A guy.
[59:27.48]Why do I have to take him out?
[59:28.46]Oh, this gun's not good for that at all.
[59:32.74]That gun's not good for that at all.
[59:36.17]Dude, what the fuck is- why?
[59:47.38]Okay, well, let me actually shoot this guy.
[59:50.96]But this shit- my Viewfinder's all fogged up.
[59:55.74]Got him.
[60:10.74]What happened?
[60:12.68]Oh my god.
[60:13.34]Why am I covered in blood?
[60:14.80]What is going on?
[60:20.03]Everything's so bright.
[60:20.87]What am I shooting at right now?
[60:24.51]What is going on?
[60:31.87]Do I need to... Oh, God.
[60:33.65]Can I get out of here?
[60:34.99]That's just a duck?
[60:35.87]But what about the thing that I have to... Alright, so if I duck, are they going to see me?
[60:49.48]Oh, okay.
[61:02.08]How come we didn't break last time?
[61:03.48]We've been breaking through every time.
[61:09.14]Okay, so we did it.
[61:10.94]Congratulations.
[61:12.78]Nice work.
[61:14.28]Nope, not quite.
[61:17.46]Hang on.
[61:19.06]Are we going to go down a roller coaster?
[61:20.14]No, that guy's dead.
[61:22.28]Okay, we're fine.
[61:22.84]Nice duck.
[61:31.46]Did we make it?
[61:31.90]Uh-oh, we've got weird aliens.
[61:36.18]I saw an alien.
[61:37.34]Oh no.
[61:43.37]Duck?
[61:46.85]We're good?
[61:48.91]Oh man, I wish I had a VR helmet for this one.
[61:52.83]I ducked!
[61:53.97]I ducked!
[61:56.99]I clearly ducked right there.
[61:58.57]I'm ducking this whole time.
[62:02.35]Oh my god.
[62:05.39]Should I heal?
[62:08.38]See, look.
[62:09.06]I'm ducking under that one.
[62:10.50]I see it.
[62:11.20]Maybe I should heal.
[62:14.88]Gas mask, maybe.
[62:16.76]Bugs and shit.
[62:17.52]The game is on rails.
[62:23.36]I mean, the game is on rails right now.
[62:26.00]Because we are actually on rails.
[62:30.72]Alright, we got a safe point.
[62:33.22]I'm not gonna waste my ammo on these cutscene enemies.
[62:40.17]I thought he was an alien for a second.
[62:41.51]I was about to freak out.
[62:42.53]Did you see his head?
[62:43.21]Look at his head!
[62:43.67]I thought those were eyes.
[62:44.91]I thought he turned into an alien.
[62:47.41]That would have been a terrible... Okay.
[63:00.68]Oh great.
[63:06.16]Great.
[63:10.91]Shotgun!
[63:19.55]Oh no no no no no!
[63:20.59]Not the angry old lady in the window in 17th century London!
[63:29.86]Heal!
[63:30.30]Come on!
[63:33.82]Oh boy!
[63:35.60]Shoot it!
[63:39.08]Oh, for the love of God, just throw!
[63:42.74]Help me!
[63:43.24]Help me!
[63:44.37]Help me!
[63:45.57]Help me!
[63:51.37]Alright, we're fine.
[63:53.99]We're good.
[63:59.23]Are we good?
[64:00.73]We're going really fast right now.
[64:03.61]We're going at least like a hundred miles per hour.
[64:07.53]I'm not entirely certain this is gonna work.
[64:10.19]Oh, that hurts.
[64:11.91]And another one.
[64:19.28]Oh, that would be great.
[64:24.70]Okay.
[64:26.26]Where do we go?
[64:29.48]That was fun.
[64:37.67]This is a fun game.
[64:39.99]Anybody?
[64:40.51]You have anything on you?
[64:41.19]This weird skeleton person?
[64:43.47]No.
[64:49.31]Lights.
[64:52.13]Bad alien man.
[64:53.61]Somebody has a trap here.
[64:56.54]Not gonna happen today.
[64:58.00]I will... I can't carry any more of these anyways, so... Don't matter.
[65:03.70]Wait, can I go in here?
[65:06.36]No.
[65:11.40]I remember when this game was top-notch for its graphics four years ago.
[65:15.22]I mean, the game still is.
[65:19.64]The game still does look good.
[65:25.06]It's not like the game looks bad or anything.
[65:32.28]We're going the right way, I guess.
[65:35.65]I don't like this bug stuff, though.
[65:38.87]Get these bugs off my screen.
[65:39.81]I don't want to see any more of these dumb bugs.
[65:46.11]What was that?
[65:47.53]I think I was supposed to get jump scared right there, but it didn't happen.
[65:54.42]What do you want me to do here?
[65:55.52]Alright, I got the envelope.
[66:03.43]You want me to go out?
[66:04.09]I have to go that way?
[66:05.55]Why?
[66:10.85]Too oblivious to see the jump scare.
[66:15.11]God, please.
[66:19.43]So we do have to go that way.
[66:21.38]Okay.
[66:21.48]Okay.
[66:24.11]You prefer Last Light?
[66:26.01]I've only played this one so far.
[66:29.73]Wipe the bugs off?
[66:32.48]That's not how you wipe the bugs off.
[66:36.86]I went by a pipe?
[66:39.72]Weird.
[66:41.44]Well, the thing that jumpscared is gonna be right here.
[66:44.57]The thing that I should be scared of, right?
[66:52.97]I'm going to be ready for it.
[66:53.75]There's another one of these twines.
[66:57.71]Okay, I didn't trigger that, did I?
[67:01.48]You guys heard the noise a few times, like I did.
[67:12.69]I guess it just wants me to go over here.
[67:16.01]Apparently there's a tube I didn't touch.
[67:21.63]Some kind of tube?
[67:24.78]Is this the tube?
[67:25.44]Does it go in this?
[67:29.14]What?
[67:30.54]Who would go in here?
[67:34.64]Why am I in here right now?
[67:39.91]I'm going the wrong way, but there might be something at the end of this tube.
[67:44.45]Yep.
[67:45.47]Always check one end of the tube before you go anywhere, you know what I'm saying?
[67:50.13]Get a radio, knife, that's it, right?
[67:52.21]Okay, we're good.
[67:53.35]Oh, okay.
[67:59.30]That's fine.
[68:04.28]Let's keep going.
[68:06.10]Work our way further and further through the tube, you know?
[68:16.92]Cutscene?
[68:18.10]Nice.
[68:23.60]He had a filter.
[68:24.38]I didn't take it?
[68:24.86]I thought I did.
[68:28.54]Missed a filter?
[68:29.30]What?
[68:30.34]I clicked E all over that guy's body.
[68:32.44]How did I?
[68:33.00]Really?
[68:33.28]What?
[68:33.80]Come on.
[68:37.52]Oh, that's disgusting.
[68:39.07]That is disgusting.
[68:45.19]Why did I do that?
[68:45.87]That was mean.
[68:46.59]Can I eat the rat?
[68:49.13]I can't take any of this shit, so it don't matter.
[68:53.05]I can't heal.
[68:57.90]Why am I killing the rats?
[69:00.66]That seems pretty counterintuitive, you know what I'm saying?
[69:03.85]Alright, well, obviously these are here for a reason.
[69:06.27]We're not going to touch these.
[69:08.73]Because I ain't gonna get the cavalry to come findin' me.
[69:13.97]For instance, these guys right here.
[69:15.80]We're gonna go one, two, three.
[69:16.98]They're three... What?
[69:23.20]Alright.
[69:24.28]So these are good guys.
[69:29.54]Oh.
[69:34.18]Who drew the troll face?
[69:38.32]That is a four-year-old's interpretation of what the troll face looks like.
[69:44.65]So I don't want to... Look, they're all dressed like Paul Cinnamon.
[69:53.45]Somebody's ringing the bells.
[69:56.18]Can I come in?
[69:59.30]What an epic meme.
[70:02.95]The passage to the station is closed off until... I just got trolled by that board.
[70:06.99]It was crazy.
[70:07.82]Prepare for battle.
[70:09.50]Take whatever spare ammo is left in the stash.
[70:11.76]You're one of us now.
[70:14.98]Our squad is called Children of the Underground.
[70:17.90]Is that why I'm hearing babies crying?
[70:20.12]Friends, we have to hold off the enemy for a few minutes more.
[70:24.16]Oh, not another waves of enemies fight.
[70:26.56]This will be a nasty fight.
[70:29.05]But think of your loved ones back in the station.
[70:39.57]I love how Paul Simonin's defining feature, according to Jerma, isn't the clash with the gorillas.
[70:44.75]That was his outfit while he was... Oh, I was about to stab that guy.
[70:50.08]No, I'm talking about his, like, outfit from the... I know who... I know who the clash is.
[70:53.72]You don't think I've ever heard the clash before?
[71:02.30]Plenty of ammo.
[71:05.36]Here comes the mist.
[71:07.54]No, I'm dead.
[71:12.68]No, I'm not.
[71:14.16]I got... We must hold this barrier!
[71:19.08]Oh no, what an epic fight that was!
[71:20.99]It was so epic!
[71:23.91]So many firing rounds, so many people died.
[71:27.15]I wish you could have seen it.
[71:33.74]taking all this stuff.
[71:36.58]Are we doing it again?
[71:37.30]Nope.
[71:42.49]Alright, so should I hide behind the line of sight to not get hit by the wave?
[71:47.71]Alright.
[71:50.13]I got my incendiary.
[71:52.55]Somebody praying over the loudspeaker?
[72:03.35]Alright, if I were a Left 4 Dead survival campaign, I would have a couple of gas tanks right here.
[72:10.93]Good.
[72:13.81]I would shoot that gas tank, wait for the tank.
[72:17.63]He's gonna jump over here, right into the gas, don't use your ammo yet.
[72:22.18]Only a little bit.
[72:24.00]Walking right to the fire, good positioning.
[72:39.57]I'm gonna be quiet here.
[72:47.82]Keep that loaded.
[72:49.16]Same thing.
[72:51.18]Right in front.
[72:51.72]Let them run to you.
[72:52.54]Let them get in the fire.
[72:56.28]You guys aren't letting... You're not letting them get in the fire.
[73:00.96]Right into the fire.
[73:03.22]You guys... I would be screaming on voice chat right now.
[73:08.49]If this was Left 4 Dead.
[73:12.05]Like, I'm the guy that, like, sets up the whole thing and then gets smoked out the window while my three idiot friends aren't playing correctly.
[73:19.57]Uh, getting smoked!
[73:25.82]Uh, getting smoked out the window!
[73:26.98]Getting smoked out the window!
[73:28.10]And one of your friends is, like, telling, like, a shitty story about, like, somebody at work today.
[73:33.21]Smoked out the window!
[73:34.01]Excuse me!
[73:43.76]I'm like out of ammo.
[73:45.40]No, I'm not.
[73:45.68]I don't want them to do like the weird pulse thing.
[73:53.04]Right into the fire.
[74:01.01]Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.
[74:11.24]No!
[74:19.26]Shit didn't fucking real.
[74:20.38]Oh my god.
[74:21.26]Give me a goddamn break Ten of them came down at the same time, okay cool Got smoked out the window that's what happens my teammates aren't doing anything Just wait till we get to the end of the round and we see how many special infected I killed I
[74:50.52]So I can be like, I killed the witch, I killed the tank, I killed four boomers, and four smokers.
[74:57.74]What did you do, David?
[75:00.36]And David's gonna be like, dude, I'm sorry, I'm wicked high.
[75:03.00]And you're gonna be like, fuck off, dude, and you're gonna leave the call.
[75:13.33]He reloads really slowly.
[75:19.59]Okay, I'm shooting money bullets right now.
[75:21.37]Why is that a thing?
[75:23.37]Why am I shooting the money bullets?
[75:24.91]What was that for?
[75:25.51]I don't want to be shooting the money bullets.
[75:37.93]Where?
[75:38.21]Oh, God.
[75:38.81]Give me a break, please.
[75:47.25]What?
[75:47.69]Why did it...
[76:01.45]Get that guy!
[76:02.29]Get that guy!
[76:02.89]Come on, right into the fire.
[76:11.57]Perfect.
[76:13.67]And I'm shooting the fucking money bullets again, I think.
[76:22.39]Yes, I am.
[76:24.93]Don't shoot the money bullets.
[76:26.57]Take those out.
[76:41.04]That guy's dead.
[76:43.88]Oh god!
[76:44.46]Oh my god!
[76:46.78]Oh my god!
[76:48.94]Please shoot him!
[76:52.36]Oh my god!
[76:53.90]Dude, so many come out.
[77:06.95]It's like not possible to kill them in time.
[77:13.22]They start trickling in like two or three at a time and then like 15 run out.
[77:22.00]Oh my lord.
[77:38.47]Why did you replace the AK?
[77:39.97]Now this is why the AK is, like, actually effective.
[77:42.47]This is why everybody was screaming at me to not lose the AK, because of this part of the game.
[77:52.98]I'm not even gonna fire yet.
[77:54.30]You know what I'm saying?
[77:56.72]Like, I'll fire, like, a couple of rounds.
[77:57.84]Like, these first, like, this first, like, two or three minutes is so stupid to even shoot the gun.
[78:08.93]Just fire like little handfuls of bullets.
[78:23.35]We're good.
[78:26.33]Out of bullets.
[78:27.09]Why is that guy out of bullets?
[78:29.07]Was he out of bullets last time?
[78:42.22]Okay, this is where it gets hairy Like get really dude like are you sick this
[79:49.05]SOMEBODY KILL THIS MOTHERFUCKER, PLEASE!
[79:51.03]PLEASE!
[79:51.41]I don't have any fucking bullets left.
[79:56.85]Oh my lord.
[79:57.71]Alright, I did it!
[80:14.28]Forget about my- What's with my voice cracks recently?
[80:16.60]Have you guys noticed that?
[80:21.43]You know, I think I know exactly what's happening.
[80:23.47]The reason why I'm going like... It's because... I don't want to be like a scream streamer.
[80:29.79]So I hold back my screaming.
[80:32.46]And it makes my voice cut off.
[80:34.50]Because I don't want to be like... So I go like... And I turn into like a horn.
[80:42.34]Make sure I get all the ammo.
[80:49.91]Anything like out here just for giggles Am I or I'm already a scream streamer no, I don't know but I don't like associate me with that I don't be a scream streamer That's why I've been trying to quell it.
[81:03.70]I've been trying just to go like Too many of the mutants broke through must be warned
[81:15.11]Clown.
[81:15.23]I'll be a clown, that's fine.
[81:16.47]Do I have any bullets in these guns?
[81:18.95]No, I don't.
[81:19.41]I'm going to have to use this thing for now.
[81:20.79]What is that?
[81:21.35]Is that a cassette tape?
[81:22.27]Yes.
[81:22.37]That's the tape he wanted me to bring and...
[81:45.08]Play the music.
[81:48.89]Nothing?
[81:54.25]Why weren't you on this?
[81:56.97]I feel like this would have made everything so much easier.
[82:02.89]I want to get over there.
[82:10.41]Well, that's how I get there.
[82:13.51]We've got some more documents.
[82:18.09]Nothing else.
[82:24.86]Broadcast the message.
[82:28.24]This is gonna burn me.
[82:32.22]We're good.
[82:36.34]And here comes wave two.
[82:42.82]Wave 2 of you have no more ammo.
[82:46.53]I have no ammo and I must scream.
[82:52.25]Open the box.
[82:52.67]What do you mean?
[82:53.59]I tried to open the box.
[82:59.68]I was pressing E on that box over and over again.
[83:01.92]Didn't do anything.
[83:10.28]This box right here?
[83:13.73]I did that.
[83:14.73]I actually did that.
[83:15.75]You guys can't tell me I didn't do that because I was staring at it, trying to get it to work.
[83:22.93]Well, these weren't bullets for that gun.
[83:26.79]I think I'm going to have to... Does anybody have a gun down here?
[83:29.21]I'm going to switch it out.
[83:33.28]What is this thing?
[83:36.20]No, it's like a shotgun.
[83:37.28]Anybody have a non-shotgun down here?
[83:39.56]No, don't load the gun up.
[83:40.98]Oh, my...
[83:43.49]Oh, look!
[83:45.93]There's an AK.
[83:46.81]I don't think this has... No.
[83:55.86]There's no bullets in this either.
[83:59.86]Maybe I should just take the shotgun.
[84:01.04]Just have two shotguns.
[84:05.02]Whatever.
[84:06.44]I don't have enough even bullets for this, so... Mercy kill the guy?
[84:18.97]Well, it doesn't do anything, so... That has wasted one of my only bullets in the gun.
[84:27.65]Kill that guy and get his bullets.
[84:30.27]That doesn't work that way.
[84:32.77]Now I only have, like, 12 bullets left in this gun.
[84:36.81]Can't wait to take on the entire Vermintide by myself with four bullets.
[84:44.59]Here we go.
[84:46.19]In fact, we're... Why do I still have this?
[84:56.72]Oh, yeah, I love that noise.
[84:58.10]There's an alien up there.
[84:59.26]Yeah.
[85:02.75]Fun stuff.
[85:03.37]Just don't get burned.
[85:09.31]I'm, like, walking up the... I'm gonna... You can... Stealth can be used against monsters, too.
[85:24.90]Right?
[85:26.22]Why wouldn't it?
[85:27.64]Just because we're all mammals, you know?
[85:29.78]We're all animals.
[85:37.05]That scared me so much that I couldn't even make a noise and I wasted so many... I thought that... I thought that thing threw the knife.
[85:49.53]Did he throw the knife?
[85:52.88]Turn the light off.
[85:58.29]Where are they coming from?
[85:59.15]They're coming out of nowhere.
[86:03.59]Do I have any bullets in this now?
[86:05.75]Yes.
[86:11.01]See what I'm saying?
[86:12.15]Do you see what I'm saying?
[86:14.30]Where did... No, I don't want these bullets.
[86:34.48]They disappear in a second.
[86:41.57]Why?
[86:43.31]Why?
[86:46.94]Where do you keep coming from?
[86:48.62]I got to get out of here.
[86:50.00]I got to get out of here.
[86:51.76]They're in the walls.
[86:53.94]They're in the goddamn walls.
[87:10.52]Jesus.
[87:13.54]They don't even make any noise.
[87:17.08]They just instantly appear on the screen.
[87:19.52]It's not fun.
[87:21.02]I don't like this.
[87:28.74]This way.
[87:29.40]Let's go.
[87:32.20]Quickly.
[87:32.74]Oh, oh, oh.
[87:41.82]They're just like... We're playing tag.
[87:43.74]That's all that's happening.
[87:44.36]We're just playing tag.
[87:46.65]Oh, they're coming up here.
[87:47.33]They're coming up here.
[87:47.85]One's up here.
[87:49.07]Where is he?
[87:50.87]Where is this guy?
[87:52.87]Oh, no.
[87:53.39]He's like inside.
[87:54.35]He's like over here in the... Where are you?
[88:14.57]What are you doing?
[88:16.69]What are you doing?
[88:18.33]I gotta get out of here.
[88:19.95]I'm gonna have a heart attack in here, guys.
[88:23.07]Where is he?
[88:23.41]He's already here.
[88:27.93]I don't know.
[88:28.29]Which way?
[88:28.79]This way?
[88:29.09]I don't know.
[88:29.91]I don't know.
[88:30.27]Where is he?
[88:39.42]Might be necessary and might be good to have a loaded weapon.
[88:43.96]Okay.
[88:46.02]When this piece of crap shows its face, we're going to 1, 2, 3, shoot him.
[88:48.47]We have to go this way.
[88:49.03]I need to go around.
[88:49.75]I have to go this way, I think.
[89:13.53]And then down?
[89:17.16]Bullets.
[89:19.34]I don't understand.
[89:19.98]I need to get through here.
[89:29.71]But there's no way to do that.
[89:31.65]Is there?
[89:34.71]No.
[89:35.83]I can't go down.
[89:36.47]I guess I have to go in here.
[89:42.76]You would think I could go up and around, but I guess I can't jump over this?
[89:50.70]Well, now that they're not spawning anymore, let me just look around.
[89:52.92]Go back to the first hallway?
[90:05.66]You mean like back here?
[90:06.44]Like over here?
[90:14.80]Christ, just go.
[90:16.10]Oh my lord.
[90:17.04]Oh my god.
[90:18.78]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[90:20.84]There's people behind me, people behind me.
[90:22.53]I'm fine.
[90:39.66]They just... They just come right in your face.
[90:42.52]They just come in your face.
[90:43.94]There's nothing that can... I don't have any health left.
[90:47.40]I think it's just... I gotta run.
[90:54.76]Somebody in here?
[90:58.82]Do you have anything in here?
[91:02.04]What was it?
[91:02.28]I don't know what that was.
[91:04.18]What just happened?
[91:05.46]What does it say?
[91:05.84]Okay.
[91:11.23]Oh, I need health.
[91:12.47]Bad.
[91:16.90]You don't have any health?
[91:17.72]Of course you don't.
[91:22.72]I'm so dead here.
[91:24.18]Health, thank god.
[91:29.55]Now what?
[91:32.01]Straight up.
[91:41.74]Might as well... No, don't jump.
[91:43.02]I'm not even going to check.
[91:44.40]Get me out of here.
[91:45.94]At least I got a save point.
[91:50.76]No, take that off, you dingus.
[91:56.67]Dermot, can you please rip ass into the mic?
[92:02.91]What?
[92:04.05]Why?
[92:10.78]There's no bullets in this gun.
[92:11.88]I have to use the shotgun.
[92:22.89]What is that thing?
[92:27.75]This thing is weird.
[92:29.53]What is this?
[92:32.22]What are you?
[92:32.84]I need to use it, right?
[92:34.86]I have to use this thing.
[92:37.10]This thing is so interesting looking.
[92:40.79]It's like a syringe gun.
[92:48.24]It's like a crossbow.
[92:49.14]That's cool.
[92:52.66]You know, I really love the weapon variety in this game.
[92:59.36]I hear something.
[93:01.73]I hear something.
[93:03.75]I think the gas mask is going to go on down here, I'm assuming.
[93:08.53]Yeah.
[93:10.67]Now where?
[93:11.81]Straight ahead.
[93:30.78]God damn it.
[93:37.88]Can you see me?
[93:38.30]Doesn't see me yet.
[93:39.80]Oh, it's one of these.
[93:40.22]This is a pump gun.
[93:43.60]I'm wasting time.
[93:44.24]I gotta get out of here.
[93:49.25]He just tried to Dark Souls dodge me.
[93:53.43]This thing sucks.
[93:56.27]This thing's terrible.
[93:57.25]Get this thing out of here.
[93:58.53]Can I go in the mouse hole?
[93:59.33]I'm dead.
[94:01.94]I can't see anything.
[94:03.64]I can't see!
[94:06.06]My screen is if I pulled a police siren directly in front of my face.
[94:12.98]I can't go that way.
[94:13.95]I'm dead.
[94:34.97]I'm going to use the shotgun here, because I feel like I need to.
[94:37.37]Up here, let's grab any useful stuff.
[94:48.75]Still, how the hell am I supposed to get by this?
[94:55.90]I just have to go this way.
[94:58.66]Please.
[95:02.32]You little shits.
[95:11.67]That's locked.
[95:12.57]And that's fire.
[95:15.61]I saw you go down the whack-a-mole.
[95:17.43]I saw you do it.
[95:23.75]Can I... I can't go down the little whack-a-mole post.
[95:30.12]God.
[95:30.90]Jesus Christ.
[95:33.60]Why?
[95:35.64]Ugh.
[95:39.32]Ugh!
[95:52.26]They're fucking everywhere.
[95:53.76]They're everywhere, man.
[95:59.75]They just don't stop.
[96:00.99]I have to get up top.
[96:02.19]Let me do that.
[96:03.43]Just kill me.
[96:04.45]If I can do this shit again.
[96:06.91]How do I get up there, though?
[96:08.29]How do I get up top?
[96:14.62]This is just a... God damn.
[96:19.02]I have to get up here.
[96:20.58]Can I like smash that?
[96:21.68]Alright.
[96:32.49]I'm just running and I'm running through the fire.
[96:35.21]Gas mask on.
[96:36.99]Sprinting through the fire.
[96:43.56]Okay.
[96:43.88]I did...
[96:52.45]Just go, go, go, go, go.
[96:53.31]Don't get time for this.
[96:56.07]I hear babies crying.
[97:05.02]You little dicks.
[97:07.40]You little dicks.
[97:09.37]I hate these things.
[97:12.05]They're so irritating.
[97:13.73]You're the most irritating enemy ever.
[97:17.97]Can that be the end of you, though?
[97:19.61]Can I be done with you, please?
[97:25.12]uncle uncle come on get up we'll get eaten please wake up this is morbid why are you sleeping let's go to mom you told me you'll take me to go away leave me alone mom told me not to talk to strangers please uncle are you hurt say something
[97:47.16]He won't wake up.
[97:48.80]I think he's dead.
[97:50.62]He's dead, isn't he?
[97:53.24]You'll take me?
[97:54.18]I don't know you, but if I don't, I guess I'll get eaten by the monsters.
[98:00.39]This feels very not real.
[98:02.43]Is this like a dream sequence?
[98:03.63]You have a gun?
[98:04.95]Okay, maybe I'll come with you then.
[98:07.49]You can shoot the monsters, right?
[98:13.40]I have a small child companion.
[98:15.19]No.
[98:21.94]No, wait, he's riding... He's riding on my back.
[98:25.74]That's fantastic.
[98:26.56]Aw, I can't go back this way.
[98:28.54]Alright, you tell me when there's monsters behind me.
[98:31.23]You be my eyes and my ears.
[98:51.65]And we'll get out of this one together.
[98:55.27]Then you'll be my new son.
[99:02.06]No more bullets, but I'm gonna pump it.
[99:07.82]Yeah, pump that Super Soaker up to max.
[99:10.30]Over max, so when you spray somebody, it hurts.
[99:14.26]The Jet Stream is so powerful that the water hurts their skin.
[99:25.95]Um... Give me this thing.
[99:30.34]Is it just double barrel?
[99:33.06]You know what?
[99:33.52]We're gonna go... No, no, no.
[99:35.93]This is dumb.
[99:36.65]This thing's dumb.
[99:39.23]Give me this stupid thing back.
[99:41.41]No, you know what?
[99:43.40]I have just two shotguns.
[99:53.24]I love how I just keep... Get the meat?
[99:55.40]What do you mean get the meat?
[99:56.22]There's no meat.
[99:57.02]Do I have to... I have to take my gas mask off.
[99:59.36]Wasting fucking gas.
[100:04.89]Same ammo type is a bad idea.
[100:06.43]That's what I figured.
[100:07.11]Alright, you know what?
[100:08.37]I got an idea.
[100:08.83]Did this work?
[100:12.01]Is this gonna work?
[100:19.57]Did it work?
[100:23.87]It doesn't work.
[100:25.11]I can't blow up the anthill.
[100:29.40]There we go.
[100:30.66]Watch this.
[100:35.10]Come on!
[100:41.79]Look out!
[100:42.57]Oh, look out!
[100:44.07]There are monsters!
[100:48.87]This isn't Gears of War.
[100:51.83]You know what?
[100:52.38]Get your shots in while you can, you little shits.
[100:56.62]That's fine.
[100:59.62]You're gonna hit me and then you're gonna run.
[101:03.54]Watch out!
[101:04.12]Disarm that boom!
[101:05.15]Okay.
[101:09.19]There's a gas can.
[101:18.32]Use the grenade.
[101:18.88]See?
[101:19.42]That's what I was going to do.
[101:23.32]I'm not allowed to touch it, but there's ammo in that locker.
[101:32.76]That one.
[101:36.78]It's just like burning him.
[101:39.36]Which locker?
[101:39.94]This one?
[101:40.30]Ooh, thanks, Kit.
[101:48.57]Roast him.
[101:50.57]Uh-uh.
[101:50.71]Where... Ay-yi-yi.
[101:57.75]Yeah?
[101:58.41]Well, where is that gun, little Timmy?
[102:00.37]More anthills.
[102:01.01]I still have no more health.
[102:20.87]That was not in the back.
[102:21.81]That was in front.
[102:23.15]That was right next to us.
[102:25.13]And now I'm going to die.
[102:26.05]I don't have enough health.
[102:28.73]We're going to take this AK.
[102:33.73]Give me the bullets, please.
[102:38.53]Did I get the bullets out of the guy's hand?
[102:41.56]Oh.
[102:43.04]Oh, where is he?
[102:44.04]Oh.
[102:45.78]Oh, come on.
[102:53.51]He can wedge through that little thing.
[102:55.33]I need that AK right now with those bullets.
[102:58.05]Right now.
[102:58.39]Slow callouts.
[102:59.09]I know, really.
[102:59.45]Tell me about it.
[103:27.71]Alright.
[103:29.50]I don't want to use the money weapon.
[103:35.66]This is not the money weapon, right?
[103:37.64]I need to know.
[103:39.32]I don't think it is.
[103:41.68]But we're going to use the shotgun.
[103:42.94]Because the shotgun I think is more effective versus the little weirdos.
[103:45.10]Nothing?
[103:55.38]Nothing?
[103:57.27]What's that little shiny thing on the ground?
[104:15.00]Take the ammo out of the gun.
[104:15.86]Reload this.
[104:21.58]Wait, is that ammo?
[104:22.62]Yep.
[104:29.09]No, it's the same.
[104:30.41]Thank God this guy has healing on his chest.
[104:32.47]Thank God you have cheese on you.
[104:33.63]What about the... No.
[104:41.29]I just burped really, really badly in my own brain.
[104:44.47]Weird.
[104:44.93]Okay.
[104:45.65]Weird.
[104:49.15]Yeah.
[104:49.51]Yeah.
[105:08.52]That didn't happen.
[105:12.98]Huh?
[105:14.38]Where am I?
[105:17.35]Okay.
[105:18.07]Thank God.
[105:25.79]So, quite literally, you get pulled down.
[105:29.19]That didn't happen at any other hole, so that's fine.
[105:32.83]I already got the cheese.
[105:34.92]Hey, look out a hole.
[105:38.52]So I'm going to wait for him to come up.
[105:40.64]Or I'm going to sneak around the left.
[105:46.65]Okay.
[105:48.25]Another hole.
[105:51.99]Okay, don't throw any grenades in this room.
[105:54.83]Where are you seeing... You didn't even see him.
[105:57.33]How can you...
[106:09.14]Stupid little assholes.
[106:12.40]I'm just running.
[106:14.00]Just go.
[106:14.34]I don't even care.
[106:15.44]I'm gonna miss items.
[106:16.42]I'm gonna miss weapons.
[106:17.47]This place sucks.
[106:19.05]This place is stupid.
[106:20.13]I don't like this place.
[106:20.97]I'm done with this place.
[106:25.67]Give me the bullets.
[106:34.82]Let's go.
[106:38.22]Alright, save point.
[106:39.29]Where are we going from here?
[106:41.97]Right in here.
[106:42.63]Keep going.
[106:43.51]Sprint.
[106:45.66]Get me to the sta-
[106:49.36]You tell me that, Mist.
[106:50.28]You tell me that.
[106:51.65]Don't tell me that.
[106:52.81]That's not what you... Can I have your... I can't take this gun.
[107:19.13]What do you mean there's no ammo in this gun?
[107:21.85]Give it to me.
[107:26.79]Whatever.
[107:29.06]Wow.
[107:30.20]What's that up there?
[107:32.18]Wait.
[107:32.86]Uncle showed me a picture once.
[107:34.76]Nice.
[107:37.32]We have to scale that way up here.
[107:39.09]It's like a painted ceiling.
[107:41.77]I'll be famous.
[107:43.19]I saw this guy.
[107:45.52]Watch out for the- Just move the barrels out of the way.
[107:47.22]Get out of the way.
[107:47.76]We have to get up here quickly.
[107:49.37]Do you think we can climb all the way to the sky?
[107:52.69]Yes, I do.
[107:53.59]But you need to hold on tight and you need to be quiet.
[107:56.11]I don't really want to go this high.
[107:58.53]Don't drop me.
[108:00.33]I'm not gonna drop you, don't worry.
[108:02.86]If you drop, I drop.
[108:04.36]So... It ain't gonna happen.
[108:06.44]Mommy!
[108:08.02]Mommy!
[108:08.14]That's my mom!
[108:10.20]Wait, what?
[108:10.44]She's looking for me!
[108:14.34]Is this real?
[108:23.24]Hold on.
[108:26.34]Hold on.
[108:27.26]Oh, shit.
[108:28.02]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[108:30.30]Don't blow it already.
[108:31.73]Fuck.
[108:46.73]get up here man come on quickly I'm trying to go too fast I'm like blowing it so bad I'm trying to get his voice
[109:14.55]Wait, I hope you don't drop me.
[109:21.05]Go, I, slow down.
[109:22.65]Let me get up here again.
[109:25.72]Oh my god, why can I not do this now?
[109:28.28]It's such basic, basic video game playing.
[109:31.70]I cannot do right now.
[109:33.74]Wait, I don't really want to go this high.
[109:40.85]Don't drop me.
[109:45.61]Alright, let's go!
[109:56.38]It doesn't work.
[109:57.10]Never mind.
[109:57.66]I don't burn anymore?
[109:59.47]What were you thinking?
[110:01.85]I don't know.
[110:02.69]I was trying to drop both.
[110:22.60]Trying to drop him from a cutscene.
[110:25.02]I don't know if it was a cutscene.
[110:26.36]Oh, my son!
[110:27.04]Mom!
[110:27.36]It's okay, we're alright.
[110:48.86]I'm here.
[110:49.46]I'm the uncle.
[110:50.37]What do you got?
[110:52.55]What's that?
[110:52.95]Thank you.
[110:54.11]I don't know about this character.
[110:55.71]He just threw a grenade in here.
[111:22.90]Wait.
[111:26.93]No.
[111:27.19]Okay.
[111:27.51]Just making sure there's nothing over there.
[111:32.86]Please heal.
[111:33.48]I don't have any healing.
[111:34.26]I need to buy some.
[111:35.94]We're consistently in siren mode.
[111:37.80]Here's the hammer boy again.
[111:38.52]Alright.
[111:39.12]Let's buy some stuff.
[112:05.41]Does anybody have... Why do you have a keyboard?
[112:08.57]So, can I buy health from somebody here?
[112:10.83]Does somebody have healing?
[112:11.83]Anyone?
[112:13.97]Yes, you do.
[112:14.63]Thank God.
[112:15.45]First aid.
[112:18.13]First aid.
[112:18.79]Buy.
[112:19.71]Buy.
[112:20.19]Buy.
[112:20.59]Buy.
[112:21.47]Buy.
[112:21.77]I got... I got... Alright, what's this?
[112:25.93]Gas mask filter.
[112:27.05]Thank you.
[112:27.81]Buy.
[112:30.41]Buy it.
[112:30.71]No!
[112:30.97]No!
[112:38.85]I'm a fucking such an imba.
[112:40.17]I just, I didn't mean to even press E. Like, E, I was, I'm gonna have to reload.
[112:49.74]I'm gonna reload.
[112:50.38]Fuck it.
[112:50.84]I'm reloading.
[112:52.68]I did not mean to do that.
[112:54.20]I really didn't mean to do that.
[112:55.60]Like, I just pressed a button accidentally.
[113:00.40]We're fine.
[113:06.61]That's not a save, scum.
[113:10.82]That's just playing the game the way I didn't mean to do what I just did.
[113:16.22]First aid.
[113:19.82]One.
[113:20.14]There we go.
[113:22.76]Okay.
[113:23.26]I'm going to use one right now.
[113:26.81]Apparently, I can't use one.
[113:28.67]Okay.
[113:29.45]We got ammo.
[113:31.53]Secondary.
[113:32.57]Secondary.
[113:33.43]I've got plenty of these.
[113:34.27]I don't really need any more of these.
[113:35.77]Ammo.
[113:39.28]This is buckshot, and I need... I need some ammo, like actual ammo for the AK.
[113:50.17]How many do you get?
[113:51.35]Is it 10?
[113:53.17]30.
[113:54.35]I'm going to use the AK for a while.
[113:55.61]90.
[113:57.75]I'm going to sell the steel balls, because who cares?
[114:04.18]I'm selling the pistol rounds, too.
[114:05.48]I'm not going to use a pistol.
[114:08.41]Why would I even use a pistol?
[114:10.33]Bolts.
[114:11.03]Get rid of this dumb thing.
[114:17.19]I got buckshot and I have assault rifle ammo.
[114:19.92]I'm going to upgrade this thing though.
[114:23.46]Let's get a silencer too.
[114:24.64]Does somebody here... Yeah, this guy does.
[114:30.02]Alright, we got customize.
[114:31.54]Trade in, sell, customize.
[114:33.90]Optics barrel.
[114:35.02]Barrel.
[114:36.08]Silencer is how much?
[114:38.44]30, right?
[114:41.70]Install silencer.
[114:43.54]Please do that.
[114:47.90]Okay.
[114:49.62]I also want to put on... What else we got?
[114:53.62]Optics barrel miscellaneous.
[114:56.40]Extended mag.
[114:57.70]This is 45.
[115:01.54]Take the scope off your shotgun.
[115:04.62]Yes, laser sight, extended mag sounds kind of good, but what else can I do?
[115:10.82]IR sight, reflex sight.
[115:14.24]25, 35, 45.
[115:17.68]I'm already maxed on med kits, but I can't use one.
[115:21.64]I don't think I want a two-time sight on this.
[115:25.94]Maybe this is a reflex sight.
[115:35.42]I don't want a laser sight.
[115:36.60]I'm going to get the reflex.
[115:45.76]What do you think?
[115:49.10]Reflex?
[115:49.50]I think I'm going to pull the trigger on the reflex.
[115:52.70]That's what I'm going to do.
[115:55.70]Yeah, let's do it.
[115:58.30]No laser sight.
[116:01.92]And let's also do... I can't do extended mag.
[116:06.86]I can do laser sight.
[116:07.96]No, I don't want to put that shit on.
[116:10.69]That's dumb.
[116:12.55]This.
[116:13.15]Customize.
[116:15.77]Optics.
[116:18.21]Can I uninstall?
[116:19.91]Do I get money for uninstalling it?
[116:23.81]I get 6 ammo.
[116:26.95]That's not really worth it.
[116:29.40]Barrel.
[116:30.60]Extended barrel.
[116:31.38]45.
[116:31.86]I don't have enough.
[116:36.24]Laser sight on a shotgun.
[116:37.30]No, I want that extended barrel.
[116:38.48]45.
[116:44.06]Can I sell anything else?
[116:46.36]No!
[116:46.82]Do not sell that gun!
[116:48.82]Hold on, let me sell... Let me sell, like, a grenade or something.
[116:52.26]I have, like, a bunch of knives.
[116:54.96]Sell, sell, no.
[116:56.36]What do I need, 45?
[116:56.78]Well, let's just buy some more ammo.
[116:57.86]I think I'm good.
[117:07.52]Let's buy some more ammo.
[117:09.16]Let's max the fuck out on ammo.
[117:14.42]120.
[117:14.44]150.
[117:14.46]44.
[117:14.78]Yeah, I just want... Just give me max ammo.
[117:24.91]Alright, I'm good to go.
[117:27.21]I got good ammo.
[117:28.03]I upgraded the guns.
[117:32.09]And I have full healing, but I can't use it yet.
[117:35.07]That's kind of irritating that I can't heal.
[117:39.06]Alright.
[117:40.94]I am ready to go.
[117:42.33]I can heal here?
[117:46.37]No.
[117:56.78]I want to get the siren off my screen.
[118:01.90]Yep.
[118:03.30]Open to the next area.
[118:04.79]Welcome to hell.
[118:07.81]Sell knives only you need them during sneak missions.
[118:10.93]So, can I... Can I go through here and heal and then come back and sell my knives and get another health pack?
[118:18.27]That's what I'm gonna do.
[118:21.75]Wait, wait, wait!
[118:22.49]No, no, don't close the door yet!
[118:23.55]Don't... Oh... Okay.
[118:34.97]That's fine.
[118:36.94]Whatever.
[118:42.80]Made it to Alaska.
[118:51.60]You try.
[118:52.14]I did try.
[118:52.75]It's okay.
[118:53.11]That's all about it.
[118:57.33]I believe I need the gas mask now.
[119:00.81]Yes, I do.
[119:06.10]Snowy, snowy world.
[119:13.06]What we got?
[119:15.50]What was that?
[119:16.90]Wait, am I already being shot at right now?
[119:20.52]I am, aren't I?
[119:21.98]Am I not supposed to be here?
[119:23.72]There's no friendlies?
[119:26.28]There's not a friendlies nearby?
[119:27.73]I can't get like a fucking shitty ice cream?
[119:29.45]Okay, well, now I know.
[119:34.61]I didn't even know what was going on here.
[119:48.19]I'm gonna throw some knives.
[119:49.17]No, I'm not.
[119:53.75]This is just stealth.
[119:54.65]It's just stealth around.
[119:55.73]I'm gonna throw one knife just for fun.
[119:58.11]You know what I mean?
[119:59.73]This guy right here.
[120:05.69]Got him.
[120:06.35]Okay.
[120:06.61]I had to do that.
[120:08.97]Just for fun.
[120:09.42]Now I have ten knives.
[120:12.22]They don't all know that I'm down here.
[120:13.52]How would they even know that?
[120:16.74]My flashlight is not on.
[120:24.25]Why would they know I was here?
[120:27.09]Okay, well... That's great.
[120:29.83]Good to know.
[120:35.64]Somebody... Alright, so you tell me this right now.
[120:38.96]Somebody just died.
[120:41.00]Right?
[120:42.42]I just... I killed somebody.
[120:43.83]Somebody died.
[120:44.77]Somebody got hit in the neck with a knife.
[120:47.63]And they all know that I'm down here.
[120:53.73]Well, I can't even do anything in here anyway, so let's just go.
[120:55.87]And we'll clown it around.
[120:56.77]What does it want me to do over here?
[121:04.66]I can't... Oh...
[121:31.57]I'm back at my desktop right now.
[121:34.93]The game's gone.
[121:37.41]I didn't do anything.
[121:38.11]The game is... I am at my fucking Windows desktop.
[121:44.52]Okay.
[121:48.86]Whatever you say.
[121:49.82]Is the game... The game's not even... No, it's not still running in the background, is it?
[122:02.72]no it's just gone okay well let's go back in uh previous launch was unsuccessful would you like to start in safe mode no um what does that mean
[122:35.70]This game's kind of running terribly right now, though.
[122:39.34]This is not supposed to be like this.
[122:43.96]There we go, okay.
[122:47.34]In safe mode, there are no enemies.
[122:50.76]That'd be hilarious.
[122:55.30]Alright, same deal.
[122:59.04]Turn off the light.
[123:01.22]Watch out, don't walk in the spotlight.
[123:07.30]Is the spotlight just facing me right now?
[123:09.58]It's just staring at me, right?
[123:17.69]Is the light just pointing right at my face?
[123:22.85]Right?
[123:23.25]Am I crazy or is that a spotlight in my face?
[123:27.27]Is that a light?
[123:28.69]I can't tell.
[123:36.20]Can I take the spotlight out?
[123:37.80]I can shoot the spotlight.
[123:39.94]Alright, let's do it.
[123:53.67]They're all freaking out over there.
[124:07.24]Why?
[124:07.74]Oh my god.
[124:10.57]I'm just gonna sit here.
[124:13.91]No, don't knock the barrel!
[124:30.54]They're not gonna stop.
[124:32.42]They're like a swarm of bees right now.
[124:39.71]Do they eventually go back to normal?
[124:40.93]Or are they going to do this forever?
[124:44.07]Well, I have a free knife.
[124:46.77]Might as well use it.
[124:51.09]Oh, that would have been perfect.
[124:52.57]That would have been perfect.
[124:53.49]It'd brighten the head if that was a little bit lower.
[124:55.04]Oh, fuck.
[125:06.46]That would have been perfect.
[125:12.51]Okay, this is dumb.
[125:13.91]Like, this is just dumb.
[125:14.71]I'm wasting oxygen right now.
[125:24.98]I wonder if I can just... Maybe I can just sneak up there.
[125:35.49]Might be able to get some stealth kills here.
[125:38.51]Where's this guy?
[125:39.27]What is he?
[125:42.04]Did you just throw a grenade?
[125:43.08]I'm gonna shoot out the spotlight from here.
[126:08.13]Before I even go down there.
[126:11.43]I'm going to shoot it out from here.
[126:18.91]Oh, come on.
[126:19.79]Oh, god damn it.
[126:20.99]Get the... Go, go, go.
[126:21.79]Quick.
[126:22.23]Before they come down the stairs.
[126:24.61]I got time.
[126:25.01]I got time.
[126:25.29]You know what?
[126:32.20]Fuck it.
[126:36.68]Here we go.
[126:52.55]I've done that quite a bit.
[126:53.53]Oh, okay.
[126:54.57]I need to get this right.
[126:55.67]This is, I'm not doing, I gotta just avoid, you can't shoot it out.
[126:58.62]You just have to avoid the spotlight and you have to get down there.
[127:02.42]I get, I don't, just whatever.
[127:04.82]The spotlight has to move.
[127:05.97]You can't do anything about it.
[127:07.03]Just get away from the light.
[127:10.01]There it goes.
[127:10.71]Don't even go in this bedroom for any reason.
[127:13.45]Just watch out for the light.
[127:14.63]There he goes.
[127:17.91]Sit right here.
[127:18.69]It's going to come across.
[127:22.26]Where is it?
[127:22.58]I'm going to move.
[127:23.26]No, hold on.
[127:27.76]You can shoot it out.
[127:29.12]I've shot it out like three times and they all freak out.
[127:33.58]Where is the spotlight?
[127:35.54]I need to wait till it's like... They're all coming down here right now.
[127:45.21]Why are they... Why are they down here?
[127:48.19]I just have to wait this out.
[127:50.89]That's what has to happen.
[127:51.65]Just to wait till they all come down?
[127:52.89]I don't understand.
[127:55.74]Do I have to wait till they all walk down and then walk around them?
[128:02.80]Is the spotlight the problem here?
[128:04.48]I don't get it.
[128:05.56]I really don't.
[128:19.61]Oh.
[128:20.13]My.
[128:20.77]Fucking.
[128:21.17]God.
[128:27.00]They just have to die.
[128:29.10]There's no way.
[128:30.42]I'm just going to kill them.
[128:31.96]I'm just going to kill them.
[128:34.61]Shoot the stupid light out.
[128:36.21]Let's go.
[128:37.57]You're dead.
[128:39.25]Forget about the stealth in this game.
[128:41.15]Just kill them.
[128:47.70]What's the point of doing any stealth?
[128:49.22]It's just not going to work.
[129:03.17]Can this guy die?
[129:05.19]Thank you.
[129:29.99]Don't throw a grenade in here.
[129:30.81]Don't throw a grenade in here.
[129:39.37]Don't throw a grenade in here.
[129:46.95]Don't throw a grenade in here.
[129:49.15]Don't do it.
[129:52.38]Don't throw a grenade in here.
[130:09.06]Just like Call of Duty.
[130:11.46]Just like Call of Duty.
[130:12.76]This is how you get all the kills.
[130:14.10]This is how you win every game of Call of Duty.
[130:16.30]Just do this.
[130:16.78]Is that it?
[130:24.85]One more guy.
[130:27.13]Here he comes.
[130:28.93]We're going to end this with the last kill of the game.
[130:34.41]Right?
[130:40.06]Like I was saying, there are casualties right when I killed him.
[130:44.65]We've got casualties, including me.
[130:47.83]I'm also one of the casualties.
[130:52.17]And that's it.
[130:53.31]Now we move.
[130:58.49]Pick this guy off.
[131:00.09]The one guy that didn't go with the team.
[131:06.82]We missed the first bullet.
[131:07.64]It's alright.
[131:12.40]Just be like a ghost.
[131:20.46]What do you mean, cheater?
[131:23.30]I saw an opportunity, and I took the opportunity to get to victory.
[131:27.31]Alright, what's going on?
[131:38.83]I need another...
[131:41.57]How do I put one on?
[131:43.51]How do I put a filter on?
[131:44.89]How do I put a filter on?
[131:45.81]What's the filter button?
[131:47.75]I don't remember what it is.
[131:49.45]No, we're fine.
[132:00.30]Anybody talking?
[132:08.54]I think somebody's down there still.
[132:12.75]No, let's just walk across.
[132:17.98]Somebody's just talking.
[132:19.02]I don't know who's talking.
[132:19.84]They're like having the conversation with themselves.
[132:22.78]Oh, he's up top.
[132:26.86]That guy's looking for me in all the wrong places.
[132:31.95]Uh, you... You lose.
[132:34.75]Sorry.
[132:36.95]No, he's not on the roof.
[132:38.55]Why?
[132:38.89]I can't believe he's not up here on the fucking roof.
[132:43.44]What are you doing?
[132:51.83]Uh, we're good.
[132:53.41]Good.
[132:57.09]Vote kick.
[132:59.47]Don't vote kick me.
[133:01.56]I didn't do anything.
[133:02.22]I'm just doing well.
[133:04.78]Wait a minute.
[133:05.10]That guy might have something on his body.
[133:08.66]Nope.
[133:14.38]I can turn the light on now, I think.
[133:15.60]I think we're safe to use the light.
[133:19.95]Although this is not... I think I need to jump.
[133:23.51]No, I don't.
[133:23.95]How do I get... No, I gotta go that way.
[133:32.11]Jump from here to there.
[133:33.02]No, I don't even need to jump.
[133:40.30]How does this guy not have something on him?
[133:41.82]I'm shocked.
[133:47.62]Up we go.
[133:50.66]What's up here?
[134:18.20]Come on, man.
[134:20.80]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[134:24.18]You have to be kidding me.
[134:25.38]That guy was waiting for me.
[134:27.36]That guy was waiting for me.
[134:28.60]He waited till I got up the stairs and then just... I'm dead instantly.
[134:32.70]Oh, man.
[134:33.40]This is... God damn it.
[134:45.40]That's... That's frustrating.
[134:48.27]I got camped.
[134:50.55]Yeah.
[134:51.03]I camped all of his friends, so then he camped me.
[134:57.62]I wonder.
[134:58.78]I wonder.
[135:04.09]No, I don't wonder.
[135:07.65]Oh, dying in, like, two shots.
[135:09.49]This sucks.
[135:11.57]Oh, I'd have to do this whole thing.
[135:12.83]Just don't fuck it up again.
[135:13.99]Hold on.
[135:14.27]Let me, like, move some shit up.
[135:15.79]Give me a second.
[135:16.25]A bunch of, like, shit is in the way.
[135:20.60]My fucking, like, microphone is, like, in the goddamn... Oh, I'm so flustered right now.
[135:26.86]Get out of the goddamn way.
[135:28.12]My microphone's, like, constricting me.
[135:34.78]Let's do it again.
[135:37.18]Not messing around right now.
[136:11.78]Fuck off.
[136:14.05]Dickheads.
[136:31.56]Alright.
[136:36.92]Let's go.
[136:52.40]Got them.
[136:53.47]I got them all.
[136:54.53]All of them.
[136:55.29]All dead.
[137:01.18]Tons of free stuff here.
[137:02.73]Perfect.
[137:12.53]Vote kick.
[137:13.97]17 out of 100.
[137:14.27]You guys, give me a break.
[137:19.27]Alright, there's a guy on the roof.
[137:21.85]There's two people on the roof.
[137:23.21]Don't blow... Wait, there's a guy right here, too.
[137:25.81]Is that a guy?
[137:26.37]Or is that a light just shining over here?
[137:30.98]I can't tell.
[137:31.46]I don't know.
[137:31.76]Is that a guy?
[137:32.22]I don't think so.
[137:42.50]Alright, guy on the roof.
[137:45.38]And his friend.
[137:48.12]They're both over here.
[137:54.86]Where are you?
[137:55.94]I can't even smell him anymore.
[138:01.35]Yep, they're waiting for me.
[138:02.53]They're in team chat right now.
[138:04.17]They're just talking in team chat.
[138:08.43]They're going to pull the same shit again?
[138:09.69]You think you're going to get me this time?
[138:10.85]Nope, you're not.
[138:15.79]Let's heal up.
[138:21.72]Alright, let's refill this.
[138:27.38]Here we go.
[138:32.08]No, don't be an idiot here.
[138:33.50]Be safe.
[138:38.28]Don't be a freaking, freaking idiot.
[138:41.40]You know what I mean?
[138:41.82]Don't be a freaking idiot here, Jeremy.
[138:49.06]Alright, here we go.
[138:50.62]They're waiting for me to come up the stairs.
[138:53.26]So I'm going to do them... I'm going to do them a little solid here.
[138:56.58]Waiting for... They're... Yep.
[139:00.32]Guns are aimed right here.
[139:02.05]I'll show you how we do this.
[139:08.91]Even into the wind.
[139:09.99]Got him.
[139:10.21]Where's his friend?
[139:18.14]Nope.
[139:18.78]He's right here somewhere.
[139:19.66]Where?
[139:23.52]Where is he?
[139:25.82]Where are you?
[139:28.49]Yup.
[139:33.51]Alright, that should be it, right?
[139:40.07]Good.
[139:41.57]I think the mask... Can the mask come off now?
[139:47.58]Mask is okay to be off?
[139:50.31]Seems like it.
[139:52.79]Nope.
[139:53.33]Never mind.
[139:58.29]What's all the toothpaste all over the ground?
[139:59.85]Why does this room exist?
[140:02.51]Oh.
[140:03.61]Oh.
[140:04.53]That's why.
[140:05.91]Okay.
[140:06.23]Well, that's a lot of filters.
[140:11.78]And there's also... Whoa!
[140:17.21]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[140:18.21]The game saved, right?
[140:18.97]The game saved right there, didn't it?
[140:22.09]Oh, thank God.
[140:27.87]Why?
[140:28.78]What happened?
[140:31.04]I don't even understand.
[140:33.32]Okay, get this stuff again.
[140:41.22]What happened back here?
[140:43.90]What happened?
[140:45.08]What is happening over here?
[140:47.23]Am I stepping on landmines?
[140:51.85]I don't get it.
[140:52.53]There's nothing there.
[140:53.91]I want to examine over there.
[140:57.51]What is over here?
[140:58.31]Oh, it's... Alright.
[141:07.14]So, what does this guy have?
[141:09.16]That was so... They wanted to hide everything over here for some reason.
[141:11.96]Why?
[141:14.04]There was no reason for any of that.
[141:15.56]It was useless.
[141:17.79]But that's great.
[141:26.04]Let's go.
[141:26.44]Right, the screen.
[141:32.14]No, no, no.
[141:33.14]Put it down.
[141:34.44]Put the lighter down.
[141:39.08]This way.
[141:44.59]Straight ahead.
[141:45.13]Let's kill the light.
[141:48.29]Oh, there is a monster here now.
[141:58.28]Do they have anything on them?
[141:59.92]Kill the light.
[142:00.32]Kill the light.
[142:00.70]Kill the light.
[142:01.04]Kill the light.
[142:02.52]Up here.
[142:07.48]The monster can't hear me.
[142:12.44]I can't get up here?
[142:13.09]Yeah, I can.
[142:19.64]It's a cruel world, that's right.
[142:21.42]Is there nothing up here?
[142:28.12]No, there's a door.
[142:31.61]What?
[142:33.99]Oh.
[142:44.89]Why?
[142:45.75]What?
[142:46.03]Because I turned off the light?
[142:53.30]Put the gas mask, no, put the gas mask on.
[142:55.37]Put the gas mask on.
[142:57.19]He ducked!
[143:01.34]What?
[143:27.04]Wait, did I miss the stuff?
[143:32.74]I think I missed the stuff because I went the other way.
[143:36.55]I missed the stuff.
[143:43.97]Make sure you get those filters.
[143:51.76]Should've looked where you were going, man.
[143:53.84]I can't be the one to be your... What, I'm gonna be your babysitter?
[143:59.59]Okay.
[144:01.23]I heard something.
[144:05.29]Oh, what was that?
[144:07.43]I heard something!
[144:19.53]What am I doing?
[144:20.29]What are you doing?
[144:21.30]Why are you doing this?
[144:22.30]There's no reason to do what you just did.
[144:24.88]Just get over it.
[144:25.86]Go.
[144:26.54]There's no reason to do any of that.
[144:28.46]There's no reason for it.
[144:30.54]All you did is added extra time to your game.
[144:32.84]Just go.
[144:33.84]What are you... What was the point of that?
[144:57.74]Oh, come on.
[144:58.82]No.
[145:04.84]I'm not quicksaving?
[145:05.64]There is no quicksave in this game.
[145:08.20]What do you think of him?
[145:09.00]A stupid buddy?
[145:12.76]Okay.
[145:13.32]Oh, I think I heard something come through here.
[145:20.64]Room to room.
[145:25.12]Nothing of interest in here.
[145:26.43]I just gotta wait till he comes back.
[145:29.95]I think.
[145:30.65]There's nothing in here.
[145:31.33]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[145:34.17]So we need to wait until I have an opportunity to get through here and this guy comes through with his flashlight and I zap him.
[145:43.11]I can go out the window.
[145:44.98]Why would I want to do this?
[145:45.92]Maybe I should... I guess I'm doing this.
[145:51.12]What did I do this for?
[145:51.80]I guess I can go underneath?
[145:59.19]I guess.
[146:01.23]Apparently this is the way I was supposed to go.
[146:03.39]There's healing here, but I don't need it.
[146:04.69]Can I go up there?
[146:13.57]I can go up there.
[146:20.34]I didn't just, like, screw myself, did I?
[146:21.84]Let me just check, because there's probably stuff back here.
[146:26.24]Yeah, there is.
[146:29.64]There is stuff back here.
[146:30.82]That's where I just was.
[146:37.74]What does it want me to... It wants me to go back there, though.
[146:40.22]What about underneath here?
[146:43.64]Dead guy.
[146:46.62]What was... Beep, beep, beeps.
[146:48.98]This is radiation.
[146:51.19]Get out of the radiation.
[146:53.57]Get out of the radiation, please.
[146:55.61]Get out of the radiation.
[146:58.67]Get out.
[147:01.05]Oh, God.
[147:01.39]Okay, now I can heal.
[147:02.91]And go take the healing that I left over there.
[147:04.97]This is useless.
[147:05.65]What am I doing?
[147:07.87]You're not kicking me out.
[147:09.85]I ain't going anywhere.
[147:12.86]You guys don't think I have like a hack to prevent getting kicked from the server?
[147:17.08]Where was the guy that had the cheese?
[147:18.16]Right here.
[147:22.12]That guy tried to vote kick me.
[147:33.28]Oh, go.
[147:33.78]Get on the ladder.
[147:36.64]Get on the ladder.
[147:37.26]Get... What are you doing?
[147:38.20]Get... Climb the ladder.
[147:38.90]This is a ladder.
[147:39.54]This is a ladder, right?
[147:43.31]I can't get this up.
[147:44.05]I'm stuck here.
[147:44.55]I don't know what happened.
[147:46.57]Is this not a ladder?
[147:58.37]It's a ladder.
[148:02.80]Why?
[148:03.04]I'm not gonna ask any questions.
[148:06.56]Oh my god, there he is.
[148:07.30]This is just like a hideout.
[148:12.53]Fuck.
[148:12.71]Alright, I'm broadcasting the message.
[148:38.65]Got a save here.
[148:39.21]That's good.
[148:40.77]We need to make our way through the monster zone.
[148:52.35]You must destroy the tunnels.
[148:56.72]Is he going to move?
[149:06.59]Okay.
[149:07.19]I don't think there's a way around.
[149:08.29]I just have to go around him.
[149:11.53]Right.
[149:13.67]He's in the area now.
[149:14.33]Now it's time to move.
[149:16.61]Nothing?
[149:17.17]Nothing on him.
[149:18.43]Okay.
[149:18.79]He's going to come back here in a second.
[149:20.05]What do I do?
[149:20.49]Go this way.
[149:25.83]Oh my.
[149:26.21]Does he see me?
[149:27.01]Hold on.
[149:27.67]I got to...
[149:33.21]How do I... Clip the wires, man.
[149:36.51]Clip the wire!
[149:38.25]Clip the wire.
[149:38.89]Why can I not clip this wire?
[149:41.03]Cut the wire.
[149:48.13]Shit.
[149:51.53]Oh, don't alarm.
[149:52.69]They're here.
[149:57.42]Is he gonna come up the stairs?
[150:01.16]Where is he?
[150:05.04]I can't cut these wires.
[150:09.86]Where do I need to go?
[150:10.53]I need to go this way.
[150:12.11]Oh, he's right there.
[150:12.83]He's just like, yep, I'm gonna wait for you to come out of there, man.
[150:17.96]Ooh, what's that?
[150:27.42]Get fucking destroyed.
[150:28.98]Get destroyed.
[150:30.52]Get destroyed, you idiot.
[150:32.52]That's how I win.
[150:34.10]I win, you lose.
[150:35.70]Hardest enemy in the game dead.
[150:36.86]Does he have anything on him?
[150:49.03]Oh, whoa!
[150:50.99]Whoa, wait!
[151:11.03]They're just like... It doesn't even matter.
[151:14.61]It's...
[151:27.52]Literally, like, those guys were just, like, there was like four of them, just AI stuffed in the same spot.
[151:34.02]Where is he?
[151:34.74]I don't know where he is.
[151:35.82]Keep looking.
[151:36.60]I heard something.
[151:37.46]Where is he?
[151:38.12]I don't know.
[151:38.92]Where is he?
[151:40.20]And then I get in the one spot where the AI understands to go, and they all come through the same door.
[151:44.70]Give me a break.
[152:10.58]Come back here.
[152:11.02]Come on, do it again.
[152:15.80]Let me get this.
[152:39.77]It works every time.
[152:40.87]So now I don't have to worry about that guy anymore.
[152:46.81]So let's just like... I'm going to jump over this.
[153:01.56]Just take a look.
[153:04.60]I got the save point right here.
[153:05.60]Bingo.
[153:08.69]So I need to go that way.
[153:12.63]This is where they are.
[153:13.40]They're gonna come out of here.
[153:15.36]They're all down there.
[153:19.16]Easy.
[153:38.73]Yeah, good.
[153:40.09]Sound the alarm.
[153:48.51]When are you going to come out here?
[153:54.07]Got him.
[154:00.33]Is that it?
[154:01.98]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[154:04.10]Oh, oh, you're trying to...
[154:12.79]That guy freaked out.
[154:13.42]I don't know what happened with that guy.
[154:14.68]That guy had an absolute meltdown.
[154:24.92]Both sides covered.
[154:28.56]Which side?
[154:35.25]I don't know which side he's going to come from.
[154:41.25]Not that way.
[154:58.88]Nice job peering over here.
[155:04.89]Where's this other guy?
[155:12.19]Oh, Jesus.
[155:25.12]Sounds like Reinhardt Where are these guys?
[155:42.71]I don't know where he is
[155:49.30]Is this an escape route?
[155:51.44]Yes, it is.
[155:53.88]Yes, it is.
[155:58.54]Why does this give me a save point right here?
[156:06.11]I guess we are going this way.
[156:09.27]You got anything in here?
[156:09.99]Oh, here they are.
[156:12.53]There's a ladder right here.
[156:14.85]Not going to use the ladder yet.
[156:15.85]We're going to make a couple of stealth kills here.
[156:36.07]It's like a carnival game What why I know this that went through his head I
[156:56.66]Are you kidding me?
[157:00.62]You guys are idiots, man.
[157:04.20]I get it all back.
[157:11.05]No, must have been my imagination.
[157:12.99]I almost spelled my name.
[157:16.59]That's how many times I missed.
[157:18.39]What do I hear?
[157:18.83]What do I hear?
[157:19.19]What do I hear?
[157:20.62]No, we're fine.
[157:23.84]No, pull out the flashlight, dummy.
[157:28.23]Now I just gave myself away.
[157:33.62]Where's his light coming from?
[157:39.14]His last dying breath, he threw his gun at me.
[157:47.67]Alright, where are we gonna go?
[157:48.75]We gotta go over here.
[157:52.89]Didn't I just come from over this way?
[157:56.07]I guess not.
[157:58.66]There is a hole to go down.
[158:01.28]Hello!
[158:03.98]I hope I have a filter.
[158:06.10]Otherwise, I'm going to be in real big trouble.
[158:20.55]I have one more filter, I think.
[158:33.30]Alright, no more jokes!
[158:34.90]No more jokes!
[158:40.94]Alright, no more jokes!
[158:50.54]Where are those things?
[159:04.16]I missed him completely, but it still hit him.
[159:06.38]That's okay.
[159:23.87]I'm trying.
[159:24.95]I really am.
[159:25.61]I promise.
[159:26.79]I promise I'm trying.
[159:33.24]Did he just laugh?
[159:42.96]Where is he?
[159:43.88]There's a guy with a shotgun behind me.
[159:45.50]I took too long.
[159:47.06]I didn't even hit him.
[160:04.64]Did I?
[160:04.88]Did I hit that guy?
[160:07.66]I don't know.
[160:08.00]Is he dead?
[160:10.34]He's not talking.
[160:10.96]They always talk.
[160:12.36]They never shut up.
[160:15.24]He's dead.
[160:20.02]Five.
[160:20.38]Where am I?
[160:20.68]I don't have time for this shit.
[160:26.99]I gotta go.
[160:38.17]Itching my eye.
[160:41.16]Alright, where am I going?
[160:43.02]Do I gotta go like this way?
[160:45.68]Can I break out of this?
[160:47.56]No.
[160:51.72]I think I have to go where those guys are.
[160:55.41]Yeah, I do.
[161:08.85]Time to go.
[161:09.21]No more sprinting with the gas mask.
[161:20.79]Oh, thank God I found those filters.
[161:23.05]Those are so necessary right now.
[161:25.37]I killed the monster.
[161:27.38]Monster is dead.
[161:31.30]Just need to go this... Is that guy in the car?
[161:36.08]I think that guy was driving the car.
[161:37.88]No.
[161:40.54]That looked like he got out of the car.
[161:42.74]Oh, why is my eye so itchy?
[161:44.26]Not the time.
[161:45.08]Not the time for the eye to be itchy because I heard another monster.
[161:47.36]Where is he?
[161:49.04]Are there more than... Oh my god, there are like four of them.
[161:52.63]Oh my god, where do I go?
[161:54.33]Oh my god, there are four of those things.
[161:55.35]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[162:00.87]I'm actually terrified right now.
[162:02.66]Oh my lord in heaven.
[162:04.82]Don't attract the monsters over here.
[162:06.38]What are you doing?
[162:08.40]It's so bright.
[162:12.31]Okay, here's my chance.
[162:18.09]They're all distracted by the monster.
[162:19.99]I'm gonna heal.
[162:21.71]I'm gonna go right... No, put the lighter down.
[162:28.14]Straight across.
[162:28.62]Go.
[162:34.56]Why are you... Why?
[162:38.26]Why?
[162:38.72]What killed me instantly from behind?
[162:41.58]Oh, it killed me in a second.
[162:43.52]In one fucking second.
[162:48.05]Ah, it's so infuriating.
[162:51.79]I didn't even get a chance.
[162:54.87]Just insta-dead.
[162:56.77]Put that cookie down.
[163:04.94]Oh, of course.
[163:09.75]Give me a... He threw a fucking grenade.
[163:12.29]Oh my god.
[163:16.43]He just died.
[163:16.83]No, he didn't.
[163:17.55]He's right there.
[163:21.54]Whatever.
[163:21.98]Give me all your stuff.
[163:23.92]Give me this.
[163:26.12]Where are you?
[163:27.18]Where are you?
[163:29.22]Where even is this guy?
[163:37.41]Nice job.
[163:37.97]Okay, let's try this again.
[163:40.97]No, we're not going to try this again.
[163:41.97]I'm getting shot again.
[163:45.98]Huh?
[163:55.88]That guy wasn't here before.
[163:56.66]That guy wasn't here last time.
[163:57.64]None of these... It's the stupid spotlight.
[164:12.39]And now I have to deal with the three gargoyles.
[164:14.51]Alright, don't mess this up this time.
[164:19.73]I'm just going to get across.
[164:22.45]We're just going to get across.
[164:24.95]Don't cause any unneeded attention to yourself.
[164:29.33]Just hide.
[164:30.67]Stay behind corners.
[164:32.41]Let them fight the monsters while you sneak around.
[164:34.92]Don't do anything dumb.
[164:37.92]Just find your way across.
[164:39.38]That's alright.
[164:40.76]That's alright.
[164:41.18]That's alright!
[164:42.72]It's alright.
[164:43.14]It's not alright.
[164:49.31]Oh, I hate this part.
[164:50.85]I hate this part.
[164:54.87]I hate this.
[164:56.50]Oh, my God.
[164:57.62]Why?
[164:57.90]Come on.
[164:58.90]Give me a break.
[165:18.28]At least, like, let me know I don't have to start all the way back here.
[165:20.40]There he is.
[165:26.90]Yeah.
[165:27.37]This guy.
[165:27.87]Dude.
[165:35.61]Don't... I don't want to use the... I don't want to use the funny bullets.
[165:46.21]I want to use the other bullets, please.
[165:50.34]Thank you.
[165:51.04]Wait, am I using the funny bullets?
[165:54.30]I don't think so.
[166:00.70]These might be the funny bullets.
[166:01.82]Are they, let's see, six?
[166:08.98]No, they're not.
[166:16.05]Now here come the animals.
[166:16.99]Now how do I get away from the animals?
[166:21.76]I gotta think this through, because... You got... I got... You got animals here now.
[166:37.32]Will this guy please die?
[166:39.53]And now, instead of... Just don't... Oh man, I've already blown it.
[166:43.17]I need to just get in the spot where I'm not gonna get picked up by one of the animals.
[166:55.13]Oh shit, he's like behind me.
[166:56.84]Just heal.
[167:26.55]No animal.
[167:26.75]Aye, he's coming behind me right now.
[167:27.49]Aye, aye, aye.
[167:27.73]Aye. Aye.
[167:32.94]Aye. Aye.
[167:35.88]Where are we going?
[167:36.68]Down down down down. Down.
[167:38.78]I made it.
[167:40.67]Phew.
[167:42.79]I didn't quite make it.
[167:47.91]Something down here?
[167:49.57]I made it.
[167:52.28]That was too much.
[167:58.29]Yikes.
[168:05.02]Streamer makes it.
[168:06.22]Just barely.
[168:09.28]What's wrong with me?
[168:18.26]No, there's the guy with the glasses.
[168:22.51]There's Igon from Ghostbusters coming to save me.
[168:29.49]Hey.
[168:30.71]He's got binoculars?
[168:31.43]Oh, I got my own Igon glasses.
[168:32.61]What if I... What if I don't want that?
[168:34.47]What is that?
[168:57.57]Take this.
[168:58.47]What is this thing?
[168:59.56]Do I want this?
[169:03.98]Oh, this hurts.
[169:07.48]No, I don't wanna play the Virtual Boy.
[169:09.14]I don't think I'm gonna like this level.
[169:14.70]So I want this gun.
[169:15.70]Do I want this gun instead of the AK?
[169:22.80]What should I replace here?
[169:23.62]Should I keep the shotgun and replace the AK?
[169:34.44]I think I'm going to replace the AK.
[169:36.00]Just load this up.
[169:45.07]Shotgun is always necessary.
[169:49.09]Yeah.
[169:51.33]Okie doke.
[169:53.91]Well, here we go.
[169:58.17]Replace the shotgun?
[169:59.11]What, keep AK?
[170:02.25]What are you guys talking about?
[170:03.85]These both use the same bullets.
[170:04.91]Wait, why is everybody so angry now?
[170:10.07]Keep the AK.
[170:11.81]The shotty sucks.
[170:12.88]Well, I have like a ton of ammo for the shotgun.
[170:20.12]No, I'm just gonna go.
[170:21.72]I'm just gonna go.
[170:22.42]The AK... No, we're gonna go.
[170:24.90]We're just gonna go.
[170:26.77]I'm not gonna like...
[170:35.43]Did I trip?
[170:38.11]Can I reload this part?
[170:39.91]We're gonna reload this.
[170:41.51]Alright, reload this part.
[170:43.07]No, that's a knife.
[170:44.05]Can I hit myself in the head with a knife?
[170:48.27]No, I can't, like, can I, like, wait.
[170:57.98]Rocket jump!
[171:03.64]How's your family?
[171:06.18]Yeah, we're gonna just do... I don't want the AK anymore.
[171:10.17]We're leaving the AK.
[171:12.25]Alright.
[171:13.25]Later.
[171:14.63]The situation got worse.
[171:16.31]Nazis literally flooded the station.
[171:18.37]Everyone's gonna be very mad at me for this.
[171:20.37]Sorry.
[171:21.53]But if you can shut down their general, it'll be easier to sneak past the guards.
[171:25.63]I didn't... I thought I upgraded the shotgun once, didn't I?
[171:27.41]No, I didn't.
[171:29.03]I didn't upgrade the shotgun once.
[171:37.13]Take the new gun, keep the AK, or riot.
[171:39.61]Fine.
[171:41.31]Fine.
[171:42.93]I'll keep the AK.
[171:46.53]Why don't I have three weapon slots?
[171:47.85]I don't know.
[171:48.78]Should I?
[171:53.42]Keep AK or vote kick.
[171:54.70]I can't wait until I need the shotgun later.
[172:15.27]No, no, we're going.
[172:16.61]Guys, I'm sorry.
[172:18.35]We ain't doing this shit anymore.
[172:21.23]Wait, can that guy see me?
[172:33.12]Oh, wait!
[172:41.21]Fucking home alone trap.
[172:42.93]Of course there was.
[172:48.93]No, he threw another grenade.
[172:53.28]That guy just killed everybody.
[172:55.00]I wish we got to stay alive to see it.
[172:56.68]Oh my god.
[172:57.84]Fuck me, dude.
[172:59.32]Fuck me, man.
[173:00.24]Seriously.
[173:04.77]It's karma for leaving the shotgun.
[173:07.25]No, no, no, no.
[173:08.37]Let's go.
[173:10.03]Who cares about fancy new guns?
[173:12.33]Keep shotgun.
[173:13.46]Keep AK and shotgun.
[173:15.80]Guys.
[173:17.34]You guys gotta make this.
[173:18.76]How many people are here right now?
[173:27.02]There's 22,000 people here right now.
[173:29.72]Nobody's ever gonna make their mind up.
[173:32.27]We're going to keep the AK, and we're going to keep the new gun.
[173:40.80]We're going to make sure this is all good to go.
[173:42.38]It is.
[173:43.26]Here comes the stealth mission.
[173:45.96]Don't do anything dumb.
[173:47.42]Put on the eyes.
[173:48.54]Oh, look at that.
[173:49.42]Okay, nobody can see you.
[173:50.99]No, they can't.
[173:54.21]This is a really good outlast simulator.
[173:56.61]Where's my camcorder?
[173:58.01]Do I need batteries for this thing?
[174:01.69]Is my flashlight on?
[174:05.37]Flashlight is off.
[174:06.11]Where are we sneaking?
[174:09.07]Sneaking straight ahead.
[174:12.17]How many are in here?
[174:14.10]Two guys?
[174:14.44]Who's there?
[174:35.15]Bunch of stuff.
[174:36.99]Okay, I almost just pressed that button.
[174:40.40]And that's the alarm.
[174:41.58]I almost just pressed the alarm.
[174:45.08]What a fucking moron.
[174:48.08]Red button.
[174:48.82]I need to press it.
[174:53.68]They had families.
[174:55.77]Fighting for the wrong side.
[174:56.71]Sorry, guys.
[175:03.89]Press it.
[175:05.54]Press it.
[175:06.06]Do it.
[175:12.71]What did that do?
[175:15.79]What's happening?
[175:16.33]Why is the screen... Is this taking a picture of me?
[175:18.73]I think I'm just taking photos of myself.
[175:30.84]I don't know.
[175:31.80]Okay.
[175:31.94]Okay.
[175:34.99]That's the launch nuke button.
[175:39.55]I just launched all of Russia's nukes somewhere.
[175:43.36]Blind?
[175:43.86]What are you talking about?
[175:44.42]Blind streamer.
[175:45.16]What are you talking about?
[175:47.08]What does this do?
[175:51.32]Does it turn a light on?
[175:52.30]Oh, it turns on the spotlight.
[175:56.00]Oh, okay.
[175:58.21]I wasn't even looking that direction.
[175:59.59]What are you talking about?
[176:01.89]I was going like this.
[176:04.59]I wasn't even looking over there.
[176:05.99]For all I know, that tunnel could have been already lit up.
[176:07.71]What are you guys even on about?
[176:15.32]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[176:24.70]Instant kill right here.
[176:26.36]We're going to take him into the darkness.
[176:30.78]We saw it.
[176:31.42]We saw it.
[176:32.04]So just because somebody... If a tree shits in the woods, can you hear it?
[176:42.53]Is somebody calling?
[176:52.22]Who's calling?
[176:55.18]Somebody just like ringing this guy's phone.
[176:56.94]You didn't have anything?
[176:59.02]Really?
[177:09.01]I haven't needed to use the night vision goggles for any reason.
[177:20.07]Anybody else?
[177:22.33]Not that I can see.
[177:23.09]Let's get rid of that.
[177:31.40]I feel like that's going to screw me up somewhere down the line.
[177:41.62]What did he throw up here?
[177:43.39]That guy's reaction time was incredible.
[177:51.09]That was absolutely incredible reaction time.
[178:06.92]Where's the giant lamp?
[178:14.43]Where's this giant light?
[178:20.24]There it is.
[178:22.02]Sayonara.
[178:26.54]I think that's it.
[178:27.98]Looks like it.
[178:29.26]Yes.
[178:32.26]That guy casted a spell up here.
[178:34.14]That was not fair.
[178:34.76]Can I turn this off?
[178:39.51]Yeah.
[178:41.71]Don't matter.
[178:42.11]Nobody's alive anyways.
[178:48.31]Pot?
[178:48.57]Any food or anything I can take?
[178:49.73]Any healing?
[178:51.45]Doesn't seem like it.
[178:52.45]I don't really need to do all this.
[179:03.86]The pitch black thing.
[179:06.16]I feel like I'm doing it because I have the night vision goggles and I'm being a weirdo.
[179:10.46]Is this me being a weirdo, guys?
[179:11.58]I'm not really going the right way.
[179:15.37]What is this?
[179:15.73]Is this like an engine room?
[179:20.76]Did I just turn off the engine?
[179:23.24]I guess.
[179:27.54]I'm kind of going the wrong way.
[179:28.50]Oh, there's something over there.
[179:34.81]Shotgun bullets and a shotgun.
[179:38.63]Can't seem to carry any more of it, though.
[179:40.37]These are both loaded.
[179:48.16]One engine makes it an engine room.
[179:51.73]There's an engine inside this room and it's running.
[179:53.99]What else would you like me to call it?
[179:57.19]What else would you call that room?
[180:03.48]The room with the engine in it.
[180:14.60]Guy up top.
[180:15.48]Let's get in the trolley.
[180:21.29]I feel like I'm playing Condemned.
[180:25.01]The generator room?
[180:28.18]You put generator room, engine room, room that gives power to other room.
[180:35.54]That's a generator room.
[180:36.38]That's an engine room.
[180:37.22]That's a boiler room.
[180:38.22]I don't think I want that.
[180:44.93]Guy?
[180:46.83]Guy?
[180:50.79]This guy doesn't need... I think this guy's just freaking out in other rooms where everyone's dead.
[180:55.42]Looks like we're going down.
[181:01.06]Here comes the night vision.
[181:07.05]No.
[181:07.69]No, not really.
[181:18.98]Door?
[181:22.54]My mask is on?
[181:25.29]Why is my mask on?
[181:26.81]Why?
[181:27.11]I took it off.
[181:27.87]No, it's because I took it off and then I died.
[181:30.65]You guys remember?
[181:34.39]I took the mask.
[181:35.25]Put the... Alright, so I took the mask off and then I died and I forgot to turn it back off.
[181:43.06]You know what I'm saying.
[181:44.34]Bullshit.
[181:44.78]Let's burn all these webs.
[181:48.84]Somebody definitely moved.
[181:53.47]I'm just causing all these fires.
[181:54.85]I don't know if I'll just use... No, I kind of have to wear them.
[182:04.06]Oh, it must have been a rat.
[182:13.37]Come on, sweetie, go straight.
[182:19.89]Couple of guys over there.
[182:20.99]Yep, there's one.
[182:23.08]Is there two or one?
[182:25.86]There's two guys.
[182:30.19]Where's the other one?
[182:31.03]Where's the other one?
[182:34.97]There's one more guy over here.
[182:35.95]I saw his light.
[182:36.53]There he is.
[182:39.95]No, no, no.
[182:40.47]No alarm.
[182:40.89]No alarm.
[182:45.66]Don't sign any alarms, please.
[182:49.12]No, don't press that button.
[182:54.98]Did he press a button?
[182:55.60]Did he press it?
[182:56.06]I don't think he did.
[182:57.56]Turn this off.
[183:08.81]Oh, for the love of God.
[183:17.13]Didn't get him in the head?
[183:20.70]Show yourself.
[183:25.26]I needed to be sure.
[183:28.64]That's a lot of free things.
[183:30.06]Thank you for the free stuff.
[183:31.98]Appreciate it.
[183:36.74]I think we can go up the stairs over here.
[183:38.83]Yes.
[183:46.03]Bad guys.
[183:46.71]No bad guys.
[183:48.11]At least not right now.
[183:56.54]Weapons cache, maybe?
[183:57.72]Oh, yeah.
[183:59.98]Oh.
[184:02.20]Hello?
[184:05.88]That's a pretty nice... That's a really nice looking revolver.
[184:08.14]I kind of want to look at it.
[184:11.40]I just want to look at it.
[184:13.82]Oh, this is smooth.
[184:16.47]Oh, look at this thing.
[184:17.35]This is smooth, guys.
[184:18.55]I just want to use it.
[184:21.35]I was going to shoot a couple times.
[184:24.19]I'm going to just shoot one person with this.
[184:29.89]It's got a laser sight.
[184:33.99]I want to use this.
[184:35.01]Why can't I have three weapon slots?
[184:36.25]I'm just going to use it once.
[184:40.50]Nice.
[185:07.23]Alright, that was cool.
[185:08.05]Let's get the other gun now.
[185:09.63]That was fun.
[185:12.89]I liked that.
[185:22.97]I've ruined the lore.
[185:24.19]Why are they all dying?
[185:35.90]What just killed... Somebody...
[185:41.29]Don't blow this.
[185:41.83]I don't have a save point for a while.
[185:46.66]This guy fell down.
[185:48.04]Where's this?
[185:48.90]He's right there.
[185:53.52]Any others?
[185:58.59]No lore for you guys.
[185:59.65]Sorry.
[186:06.98]More stuff.
[186:07.86]Cool.
[186:13.55]I'm shooting him.
[186:14.17]Why is he... No, that guy died.
[186:15.95]I didn't even shoot the guy that died over there.
[186:17.40]Oh, they're playing darts.
[186:22.20]That's cute.
[186:24.82]Yeah, that's cute, guys.
[186:25.86]Bullseye.
[186:44.13]Right down the center.
[186:45.03]Look at that shit.
[186:52.87]Tell your friends about that one.
[186:54.75]Call them right now.
[186:56.57]Call your best friend right now.
[187:04.88]That's fine.
[187:11.22]How many knives do I carry?
[187:12.06]I have ten knives on me right now.
[187:16.72]If it means anything.
[187:19.01]I think we have to put gas mask on.
[187:23.41]Yes, we do.
[187:35.30]More spider webs.
[187:39.14]Uh, this is a trap.
[187:42.45]How do I make this trap happen?
[187:44.23]Oh, it's because it's right there.
[187:45.57]Alright, so just...
[187:50.10]Jump over the trap.
[187:54.36]Up we go.
[187:54.90]There's a whale down here.
[188:02.25]Just gonna do this to make sure I don't run out of... Do I not need... Wait, am I full ammo right now?
[188:12.98]Can't take the ammo out of that gun.
[188:15.90]Alright, time to press some buttons.
[188:19.34]I missed a filter, did I?
[188:23.36]I probably did because I'm a moron.
[188:34.89]Where was it?
[188:35.25]Down here?
[188:45.17]I don't know.
[188:45.56]Fuck it.
[188:59.00]I don't care.
[189:06.12]How would you feel if you heard whale noises in a metro in real life?
[189:11.84]Well, I'd be like, why is there animals down in the metro, first of all?
[189:17.78]Someone's not doing their job.
[189:19.14]And then I would call the fire department.
[189:36.39]I need that.
[189:37.23]Good.
[189:39.89]Wow, get that spider off my face.
[189:41.65]I did not like that at all.
[189:45.21]Gotta keep those dang whales from coming down into the metro station.
[190:04.69]Hey, you made it.
[190:07.25]Get into the buggy.
[190:08.51]I didn't miss an item or anything, did I?
[190:11.19]Yeah.
[190:11.65]Alright.
[190:14.85]So at one point, do we flip this thing over again?
[190:17.57]I guess not right now.
[190:20.22]I missed the best gun in the game.
[190:24.22]I did.
[190:24.40]Well, sorry.
[190:24.76]Sorry about that.
[190:39.63]Mask, mask, take off of the mask.
[190:49.28]What?
[190:50.04]And blocked.
[191:04.70]I'm blocked!
[191:05.92]Whoa!
[191:07.82]Where do I go?
[191:09.48]This way?
[191:09.86]Into the light?
[191:14.04]Into the light.
[191:15.08]That's how you become one with the universe.
[191:17.25]Wicked phenomenon, yes.
[191:19.35]But, you know, it's not any more evil than, say, fire.
[191:24.11]It all depends on your point of view.
[191:26.57]Try to get a better understanding of things before you make your judgment.
[191:30.43]Let's move out now.
[191:31.70]It's not safe here.
[191:38.90]You go towards the light.
[191:39.68]That's what everybody tells.
[191:40.42]That's on all the soap operas that I watch.
[191:44.50]When dear old Aunt Esther is lying in the bed and four of the main characters are all crying to the right.
[191:54.07]Go towards the light, Esther.
[191:57.21]And then she dies.
[191:58.63]And then she becomes reborn again.
[192:00.03]That's like a bug.
[192:01.03]Hey!
[192:02.75]Stop the engine.
[192:04.05]Do not move.
[192:05.05]Name yourselves.
[192:07.85]We're Nazis coming to take your station.
[192:10.44]Old man, is that you?
[192:12.62]Your lucky Petrovich isn't here.
[192:15.46]He's not a man for jokes.
[192:19.34]Yeah, you come back as a bug.
[192:21.31]And then when somebody steps on you, you come back as a rodent.
[192:24.85]And then when you get your head caught in a trap, you come back as a squirrel.
[192:28.69]And then when you eat too many nuts and you overeat die, you overdie.
[192:32.41]You come back as somebody's Guinea pig.
[192:35.11]And then when finally you die after like a year and a half of being alive as a Guinea pig, you move on to being a real pig.
[192:42.73]And then once somebody turns you into bacon, you turn into a cow.
[192:44.87]And then when somebody milks you to death and then turns you into stew, you turn into a dinosaur.
[192:53.56]And then after you live your whole life as a dinosaur, you turn into a planet.
[192:56.40]And then when you turn into a planet, you supernova, you turn into a galaxy.
[193:01.26]And then once the galaxy explodes, you get to become the sun.
[193:06.55]It's basic religion.
[193:19.64]Haha, so random, dude.
[193:21.70]It's not random.
[193:22.30]It's fucking... It's reincarnation.
[193:28.73]Not funny at all.
[193:29.37]I'm not trying to be funny.
[193:30.45]This one guy hates me because he thinks I'm trying to be funny.
[193:32.91]It's reincarnation.
[193:47.52]Funny stream.
[193:48.36]You know what?
[193:49.37]You're all banned.
[193:50.89]You know, turn the chat off.
[193:52.11]Turn off the chat.
[193:52.81]I want a mod to turn the chat off.
[193:57.26]You're never gonna fucking speak ever again.
[193:59.50]Turn off the chat.
[194:00.74]I don't want to see it.
[194:01.52]Turn it off.
[194:04.14]Slash turn off chat.
[194:11.43]Fucking talking about my beliefs.
[194:15.89]Making fun of what I truly believe in?
[194:17.53]Making fun of my belief system?
[194:19.87]Turn him off!
[194:20.37]I got plenty of health.
[194:40.78]I can count to five.
[194:41.34]Let me sell.
[194:41.70]Can I sell?
[194:42.20]Pistol rounds.
[194:42.52]I don't want to get rid of these.
[194:44.14]I do want to get rid of these.
[194:46.72]Buckshot bolts.
[194:47.14]Don't need.
[194:47.46]I think it's time to get rid of the buckshot, unfortunately.
[195:11.37]Are you guys gonna be good boys?
[195:14.67]Is everyone gonna be a good boy or are you gonna make fun of me?
[195:19.93]I'm the one with the power here.
[195:21.71]I'm the one in charge, okay?
[195:23.75]I'm the one that can command you, okay?
[195:25.59]I command.
[195:27.17]No one makes fun of my terrible joke.
[195:30.28]Command it.
[195:31.74]I demand it.
[195:36.48]This guy's not funny.
[195:38.72]You will be gone forever if I see that one fucking time.
[195:42.78]Let him out.
[195:43.54]Turn it on.
[195:44.24]Turn the chat back on.
[195:45.27]If I see one fucking person talk about how not funny I am, I will quit streaming for the rest of my life.
[195:54.23]I will stop streaming.
[195:55.69]Let him go.
[195:56.27]Let's see.
[195:56.59]Let's see what happens.
[195:57.11]Huh.
[196:06.56]Okay.
[196:13.72]Okay.
[196:14.94]You don't have that caliber.
[196:17.08]It's reserved.
[196:18.66]I don't have any more.
[196:20.30]Well, I'm never going to stream ever again on livestream.com.
[196:24.46]Or I'm never going to stream ever again on Hitbox.
[196:26.94]So, there you go.
[196:29.74]You guys really fucking did it now, didn't you?
[196:31.30]Stuff is falling out of your pockets already.
[196:36.28]You won't find any sharper.
[196:43.45]Livestream.com.
[196:45.11]Does that even still exist anymore?
[196:49.29]I don't think I can do anything.
[196:50.95]I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[196:52.81]I could buy another one, but I don't think I need it.
[196:54.64]Alright, where's the gun guy?
[196:56.80]Let's customize this thing.
[197:02.92]What's on it right now?
[197:03.94]Reflex?
[197:09.62]Silencer.
[197:10.04]Silencer.
[197:12.13]It's got everything on it already.
[197:13.71]Maybe I should just give this a... By the way, I'm just fucking around.
[197:20.69]If you think I suck, then you're absolutely open to that opinion.
[197:24.18]I respect your opinion.
[197:25.98]That doesn't mean I like you back.
[197:30.88]Fuck you.
[197:31.36]You can go fuck yourself.
[197:33.16]You think I suck, then you suck.
[197:35.38]Doesn't mean I'm going to tell you not to say it.
[197:37.38]You know what I'm saying?
[197:39.52]That's your opinion.
[197:40.06]You're allowed to have one.
[197:43.63]I don't respect your opinion.
[197:50.81]Looks like we're going to hitbox.
[197:55.26]I kind of want to do something weird at this.
[198:05.41]There already are... It has every upgrade already.
[198:12.27]Maybe I'll do two-time sight.
[198:15.47]I don't have the money, but... IR sight?
[198:20.03]No.
[198:21.43]It doesn't have anything on it right now?
[198:22.73]Am I insane?
[198:24.17]I'll put reflex on it.
[198:31.88]Yes.
[198:36.74]What do I get for trade-in value here?
[198:39.12]Big gun.
[198:40.83]We're at Kalash 2100.
[198:41.87]What the hell?
[198:42.61]Should I trade in a gun?
[198:43.95]This thing looks pretty awesome.
[198:45.85]Kalash 2012.
[198:46.17]Well, the big gun.
[198:50.07]I kind of want to do this.
[198:51.85]I just sold all my buckshot, though.
[199:10.63]They're both garbage.
[199:11.67]Kalash is the best gun.
[199:12.25]Kalash.
[199:12.41]I'm going to do it.
[199:13.23]Let's do it.
[199:14.29]Look, you only live once.
[199:16.27]Oh, it's $115.
[199:16.79]I can't even do it.
[199:17.75]Never mind.
[199:18.19]Okay.
[199:18.29]Well, maybe next time.
[199:18.79]We got health.
[199:19.47]We got everything.
[199:21.92]We got everything we need.
[199:41.09]Reincarnation, though.
[199:52.08]The clash is terrible.
[199:56.52]This guy's hair is really odd looking.
[200:00.86]My guns use the same ammo.
[200:02.14]You can blame chat for that because they freaked out when I was going to not take the gun I currently have in my second skill.
[200:11.89]I just got back from a casual hike up Mount Everest and this chump is still on this part.
[200:23.32]Gamer license revoked.
[200:25.08]Can I take his gun?
[200:31.77]No.
[200:32.51]Can't do anything.
[200:33.13]I just have to leave.
[200:37.19]All the way up.
[200:41.69]Blind guy with the accordion.
[200:43.11]I don't think we can do anything with him.
[200:48.72]So, how close am I?
[200:51.90]How far am I in the game right now?
[200:54.34]Jesus.
[200:54.78]Okay, well, I'm about to get, like, tried.
[201:01.35]What's the percentage we're at here?
[201:12.48]30%.
[201:12.84]I'm stunned that the council has refused to help your station.
[201:17.68]I'm ashamed that they lack the courage you have already shown.
[201:22.87]But Paulus is not the whole metro.
[201:25.65]There still are people who will rise up and fight the threat.
[201:28.27]I'm almost at the intro.
[201:30.63]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[201:32.51]Listen carefully.
[201:34.32]The Rangers have found several well-preserved missile bases near the city.
[201:38.68]The sun will probably be activated and deliver a missile strike against the dark ones.
[201:43.74]Wait, did you actually want a correct answer?
[201:45.56]Yeah, you're allowed to have your own opinion.
[201:49.36]You want to tell them, like, that's your opinion, if you think there's, like, 40 hours left in the game.
[201:54.87]However, we do know where that information can be found.
[201:59.01]There's a huge library on the surface.
[202:00.95]Dangerous place, but it contains a secret library.
[202:02.65]Except it's actually not an opinion.
[202:03.81]It's a fact.
[202:05.03]We must go there.
[202:07.48]Okay, we'll split up now to avoid the tension.
[202:09.78]You'll go up from here.
[202:11.04]I've already arranged that.
[202:12.66]When you've made your way to the library entrance, I'll be there waiting for you.
[202:17.16]Okay?
[202:17.67]We'll finish this tonight.
[202:19.53]We'll get through Metro 2033.
[202:20.61]We'll try to finish the game.
[202:22.57]One more thing.
[202:23.83]When we go back, we'll head straight for Spartabase.
[202:26.35]My rangers will meet us there.
[202:31.53]What's some of your guys' most radical opinions?
[202:34.52]Why did I do that?
[202:35.68]No, no, no.
[202:36.25]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[202:37.09]Don't write anything.
[202:37.71]What the fuck?
[202:40.85]What have I done?
[202:41.45]I'm not even going to look at chat for like 20 minutes.
[202:55.68]Uh-oh, we've got aliens.
[203:04.64]Wasn't I already here?
[203:05.26]I feel like I was here before.
[203:09.08]So, out.
[203:10.03]No, we want to go left.
[203:16.51]E-mode only mode.
[203:19.03]See?
[203:19.39]You're not allowed to have any opinions here.
[203:23.25]You're allowed to say nice things about me.
[203:29.08]Nobody has anything to say that could be considered controversial.
[203:34.19]We only do Kappa emotes.
[203:38.14]If I hit this guy right now, first shot, I swear to fucking god I'm not kidding.
[203:42.12]If I miss this shot, I will donate another $100 to charity.
[203:45.42]I swear to god.
[203:45.82]Ready?
[203:46.22]One, two, bingo!
[203:52.37]Why am I so glad about that?
[203:58.05]I should be happy to donate $100 to charity.
[204:04.59]Alright, let's keep going in the snow world.
[204:10.45]Mm-hmm.
[204:14.56]We got plenty of gas.
[204:18.24]I guess we're gonna go over here.
[204:20.80]Seems really bright out here.
[204:22.50]Like, bright to a fault.
[204:23.62]I'm not sure I like this very much.
[204:24.83]Oh.
[204:26.61]Wait, they're standing up.
[204:27.93]The prairie dog shit.
[204:32.36]Just be easy, and then I don't want to get any undeserved attention.
[204:37.08]They're eating people over there.
[204:43.18]Would you guys consider these monsters aliens?
[204:44.82]What would you say?
[204:50.96]Show us your tax returns.
[205:00.38]No, I don't have to show you guys my tax...
[205:09.30]This shit's gonna break, isn't it?
[205:17.83]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[205:19.07]Down to the dirt.
[205:19.97]Down to the dirt.
[205:20.95]We're good.
[205:21.43]Put it back on.
[205:25.44]Are you stupid?
[205:26.50]Okay.
[205:31.82]There are children in here.
[205:33.40]For some reason.
[205:39.84]I want to try this gun.
[205:40.82]I haven't even used it yet.
[205:49.11]Some ammo.
[205:49.71]That's good.
[205:50.91]Anything else?
[205:51.41]I don't want to miss much.
[205:53.81]Lots of knives.
[205:56.43]They really give you knives.
[205:57.32]They throw the knives at you in this game.
[205:58.66]Big time.
[206:05.56]Vanilla Coke is my sponsor.
[206:08.47]I wouldn't really, I would not be upset about that.
[206:11.61]Vanilla Coke is delicious.
[206:14.85]Okay.
[206:40.81]What the fuck, man?
[206:42.57]What is this booby trap nonsense?
[206:47.05]Where did that even come from?
[206:50.91]The whole building just collapsed on me.
[207:03.27]Give me this shit again.
[207:11.10]He said booby.
[207:12.22]Come on.
[207:16.34]Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[207:23.68]Ammo, ammo, ammo.
[207:27.02]Alright, now watch out for the falling rocks.
[207:30.14]For some reason, the whole building comes down.
[207:32.97]Just don't get hit by them.
[207:44.99]Does this make it impossible to go across?
[207:47.41]No, it doesn't.
[207:49.05]It's just annoying.
[207:56.48]I see a gargoyle over there, but I think we should be able to get in the building before he sees me.
[208:00.92]I hope so.
[208:01.36]I think he's in the air.
[208:11.31]Can't go in the front door, of course not.
[208:16.50]Gotta keep going this way.
[208:25.12]You know, I can imagine how awful this bitrate looks right now.
[208:29.64]Even if this was at... What do I stream at?
[208:32.06]I think I stream at 4200.
[208:32.84]Or 4300 bitrate.
[208:41.32]You can imagine how awful this looks.
[208:45.21]I'm okay.
[208:56.06]Oh, no.
[208:56.70]I just... The whole... And here comes everyone.
[208:58.90]Okay, I'm gonna do something.
[209:00.08]We're gonna do a tactic here that's gonna work out for me.
[209:02.12]I think in my favor.
[209:02.70]I'm pretty sure it will.
[209:21.50]It didn't do anything.
[209:29.69]Kinda did.
[209:33.97]That's not burning me, is it?
[209:34.85]Where is it?
[209:35.21]Is there somebody above me?
[209:40.64]Anymore.
[209:41.12]There's more, right?
[209:41.90]There's probably more.
[209:42.52]There has to be, right?
[209:43.24]Of course there is.
[209:50.50]Oh, this is not good.
[210:02.69]Huh?
[210:02.83]Is somebody calling my name?
[210:10.03]Who is this guy?
[210:16.09]Form a circle.
[210:18.03]Oh, no.
[210:18.99]Army of two.
[210:22.42]I gotta watch my bullet count here.
[210:27.36]Form a circle.
[210:28.76]That's not a circle, man.
[210:29.48]You're going the wrong way.
[210:45.04]Here they come.
[210:49.39]Watch the side.
[210:50.11]Watch the side.
[210:53.55]Behind.
[210:53.81]Behind.
[210:53.99]Behind.
[210:54.89]Why am I talking like there's other people in the server?
[210:56.63]Alright.
[210:59.97]I'm either in a server with people or I'm a chef on chopped.
[211:04.08]That's a pretty good joke.
[211:04.96]Come on.
[211:06.38]I'm using funny bolts right now.
[211:07.54]I don't want to be doing that.
[211:31.00]Alright, I'm still okay on bullets, right?
[211:37.66]Kind of, I guess.
[211:40.40]Are we moving together as a unit?
[211:41.88]I'm not sure.
[211:42.34]I hope this ends at some point, because it hasn't stopped yet.
[211:55.51]We're good, I think.
[212:07.28]Not funny streamer desperately attempts to form coherent sentences.
[212:10.82]Oh, man.
[212:14.00]Come on, it's... Oh, man, it's not easy being green.
[212:28.79]So you do actually go in here.
[212:38.56]Let's go, guys.
[212:40.43]Here we go.
[212:40.73]I have to, like, take a pee.
[212:44.65]I haven't gone to the bathroom this whole time.
[212:49.09]Library time.
[212:49.79]Why is everybody saying library time?
[212:52.67]Is this one of those you're definitely not going to have any fun parts of the game?
[212:56.13]Seems to be quiet.
[213:10.47]That guy's dead.
[213:11.71]He's gonna get sucked through the door.
[213:12.71]Someone's gonna pull him.
[213:13.45]Gremlins 2 style.
[213:20.61]He's so dead.
[213:22.69]You're not gonna make it, dude.
[213:25.90]He is gonna make it.
[213:31.40]Oh, no.
[213:31.78]Wait.
[213:31.94]These guys are actually holding the door?
[213:35.50]Oh, shit.
[213:36.06]The MGM lion's back there.
[213:45.96]Go.
[213:49.58]What?
[213:57.24]What was that?
[213:58.20]What?
[213:59.64]What are these tongues?
[214:00.42]Oh, shit.
[214:04.99]Are the tongues... Are the tongues enemies?
[214:06.43]Yes, they are.
[214:16.90]We're just running through, I think.
[214:19.95]Just don't touch them.
[214:21.21]Why are you taking your mask off?
[214:29.87]Oh, it's a new mask.
[214:36.24]How do I... There's a health up here.
[214:40.76]I want it, but I don't need it.
[214:44.60]What am I looking for here?
[214:54.27]Ow.
[214:54.53]What am I even looking for?
[214:56.09]There's a locked door upstairs.
[214:58.35]Oh, here we go.
[215:15.56]What happened?
[215:21.23]Why did it give me a save point here?
[215:31.49]Is he, like, corrupting the door?
[215:40.67]What happened here?
[215:59.13]Help!
[215:59.71]Open this door, please.
[216:06.84]Get... Open the door!
[216:07.84]What?
[216:08.08]Open... Let me out of here!
[216:09.06]Oh, okay.
[216:10.78]Thank God.
[216:11.20]Don't go anywhere.
[216:12.08]We'll come for you on our way back.
[216:14.68]We don't go anywhere.
[216:17.24]Well... Any longer, those beasts would have ripped us apart.
[216:23.95]We'd murder you.
[216:27.37]Door's stuck.
[216:28.17]Shoot it again.
[216:28.75]So this is our breakpoint.
[216:36.99]Loot the room.
[216:38.67]That should be good to go.
[216:44.17]Come look.
[216:44.81]Sure.
[216:45.21]I know how to deal with these guys.
[216:49.83]See?
[216:58.67]I just wasted ammo, but you just have to shoot him in the head.
[217:02.89]I'm running out of air.
[217:11.56]What a waste.
[217:13.80]What a typical FPS.
[217:15.94]Shoot the thing.
[217:19.64]I'm wasting gas right now.
[217:20.84]Can we please lose?
[217:26.59]Check the side rooms.
[217:33.65]Oh, well, that's a monster.
[217:37.19]Maybe I should tell them about that.
[217:38.35]Is there anything to shoot?
[217:46.37]No.
[217:49.27]This door can be broken.
[217:51.85]Strangely enough.
[217:54.97]Don't ask me why.
[217:56.45]Couldn't do that to the other one.
[218:05.30]Do I have to go into the hole?
[218:06.32]Okay.
[218:16.65]Give me your stuff.
[218:18.41]All of it, sir.
[218:22.35]Part of me wants to take that gun, but I'm not going to.
[218:29.03]Why can that door be broken?
[218:30.17]I don't know.
[218:35.06]The monster's going to be in here, though.
[218:43.12]Wherever the hell he is.
[219:04.94]I can't go back in here.
[219:05.68]There's something in this room.
[219:11.59]Maybe it's the radioactive flies.
[219:13.77]Maybe.
[219:26.23]Hmm.
[219:27.55]Maybe it's the thing that's blinking.
[219:31.27]It is.
[219:33.75]Hi, guys.
[219:35.05]I found a way to open the door.
[219:36.27]And before chandelier death.
[219:45.50]Uh-oh.
[219:46.30]Watch out.
[219:50.26]Big man coming through.
[219:56.47]The game had to hint to you.
[219:57.91]What?
[219:58.15]And I looked up and it blinked.
[220:07.80]He's gonna burst the door open.
[220:09.08]I like this level.
[220:15.06]This level is much... I think that I like this area more than any other areas in the game.
[220:20.40]Just aesthetically.
[220:27.81]That's actually the librarian.
[220:34.11]That was not the appropriate sound to come from that animal.
[220:38.04]That was a- Oh, it was this.
[220:44.96]Uh oh, no, don't be dead!
[220:54.33]Come on.
[220:55.53]He's still alive, right?
[221:05.27]So wait, the librarian is the weird goofy guy running away?
[221:08.61]Oh god.
[221:09.99]I gotta go fight a scared skinless Shrek.
[221:12.97]That's gonna be fun.
[221:14.22]I'm about to go fight like a Siamese Shrek.
[221:33.04]What's the cat that doesn't have any fur?
[221:49.56]Great.
[221:54.98]Is he just hanging out on the ceiling?
[221:57.15]Where is this guy?
[221:58.01]I'm actually freaking out right now.
[221:59.91]I'm gonna heal.
[222:07.83]Oh, man.
[222:08.54]I just... I hear, like, giggling and breathing.
[222:20.07]Ah!
[222:20.59]Where is it?
[222:21.31]Where is it?
[222:23.01]It's behind me, isn't it?
[222:25.55]It's behind me.
[222:26.61]I'm gonna turn around.
[222:27.05]It's gonna be right behind me.
[222:28.29]It's gonna be staring at me.
[222:33.64]I thought it was...
[222:42.27]You guys heard that, right?
[222:44.97]That was not my imagination.
[222:55.21]What?
[222:56.45]Why do I have a cutscene?
[223:00.97]Oh, Jesus.
[223:04.61]Look at that thing.
[223:05.31]Ugh.
[223:08.60]Ugh.
[223:14.73]Well, that's fantastic.
[223:22.29]Let me just examine the area before I go down and fight Siamese Shrek.
[223:29.19]Give me your mask.
[223:34.15]Your mask is better than mine.
[223:35.27]Alright, for one second, I thought that that was a cartoon he's knocked out.
[223:41.79]The stars flying around in a circle.
[223:44.60]I was about to say, they're gonna pull that kind of weird joke now?
[223:49.16]It's been, like, seven hours into the game.
[223:55.15]Where is he moving to?
[223:55.75]I don't want to aggro him.
[224:00.21]I can do without aggroing him.
[224:08.03]What is his line of sight like?
[224:09.03]Can he see across the whole thing?
[224:10.19]Can he see?
[224:10.61]If he can see me, can he see me?
[224:12.54]Like, can he see me right now if he can see me?
[224:21.51]Well, that wasn't fucking terrifying.
[224:25.86]He's beamed up.
[224:40.25]I want to loot that guy's body.
[224:47.27]Where is it?
[224:48.23]I can hear him.
[224:49.37]Where is he?
[224:58.27]How do I get out of here?
[225:01.30]Oh, there's a door over there I can break.
[225:02.40]What?
[225:08.22]What?
[225:20.44]What happened?
[225:26.60]Hey!
[225:32.16]Ow!
[225:34.64]You put a little pincushion in my butt!
[225:37.28]That wasn't nice!
[225:45.96]I thought he died when he fell down the first... Oh my god.
[225:49.14]Alright, so he does... He grabs you from... Okay.
[225:55.84]I understand.
[225:57.36]Just don't go where any doorways are.
[226:07.63]He's just looking out the window.
[226:08.65]He's talking shit to the gargoyle that's flying by.
[226:15.87]This is his zone, this is his turf.
[226:17.59]Alright.
[226:27.31]Where is he, where is he?
[226:28.08]Ollie, don't, don't, don't, don't, no areas where, no, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[226:31.56]Whoa!
[226:36.30]Whoa!
[226:37.54]Whoa!
[226:45.33]I don't think you can run.
[226:46.33]Oh, man.
[226:50.15]This is gonna be... I don't know about this.
[226:56.52]How am I supposed to do this?
[227:28.86]Where did he go?
[227:30.18]He's right there, he's right there, he's right there.
[227:32.64]How did he teleport?
[227:34.96]He teleported!
[227:42.99]How did he get over here this fast?
[227:59.77]Which way am I going here?
[228:00.61]Left or right?
[228:04.47]Oh, no, no.
[228:10.67]Which way is he?
[228:11.28]I hear him sprinting.
[228:12.56]I hear him sprinting right now.
[228:13.84]This is terrifying.
[228:20.48]Which way?
[228:20.84]I don't know if he's up or down.
[228:25.91]Which way do I go?
[228:27.13]I gotta go this way.
[228:27.85]I think I just gotta go out.
[228:28.97]I can't go out here.
[228:34.85]I hate this.
[228:44.10]They're all dead in hereberger.
[228:44.90]They can't go in this room.
[228:45.60]They die if they go in here.
[228:47.95]Where is he?
[228:48.55]I smell him.
[228:51.75]Where is he?
[228:53.17]Oh!
[229:03.30]What did he do?
[229:03.86]He blocked me in?
[229:06.20]Why did he do that?
[229:13.40]Okay, well, I made it.
[229:14.58]Where's my checkpoint?
[229:15.79]Give me a checkpoint.
[229:16.95]I deserve a checkpoint at this point, don't I?
[229:20.05]I deserve a checkpoint.
[229:21.77]I just do.
[229:25.47]Open the door.
[229:25.94]Get...
[229:42.63]Which way do I got to go?
[229:44.45]Left.
[229:49.31]I hate how they can be on two different planes here.
[229:54.65]I hear somebody charging their flashlight.
[229:55.95]Or is that me needing to charge my flashlight?
[229:58.63]Is that the game telling me I need to charge my flashlights flashlight?
[230:00.85]I think it is.
[230:04.45]Ah!
[230:05.95]Where?
[230:09.81]Oh, Jesus!
[230:10.87]Oh, Jesus!
[230:13.16]Jesus.
[230:23.66]This is... Not gonna lie, this is... This might be one of the scariest things.
[230:29.17]This might be... This is... Scariest... Scary game.
[230:36.11]We gotta go to the left.
[230:40.23]Not yet.
[230:45.82]Where is he?
[230:48.86]Face cam.
[230:50.10]My face cam is not going to... I'm not alt-tabbing right now, guys.
[230:55.25]Are you kidding me?
[230:55.87]I'm not going to... No.
[230:58.43]He is so close.
[230:59.49]He's right in the the room here, to the right.
[231:04.05]Should I go for it?
[231:06.77]I'm going to go for it.
[231:09.19]Okay, now I'm going to turn around and see.
[231:13.43]Nope, nothing.
[231:14.56]Good.
[231:16.90]We need to go to the right.
[231:18.56]This door needs to be broken.
[231:27.63]Aye.
[231:27.81]Oh.
[231:28.63]This is absolute just pain.
[231:37.03]This is pain.
[231:40.97]That was a lot of stuff in that toilet.
[231:45.39]Hide.
[231:48.14]Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide.
[232:04.59]Nothing else in here, right?
[232:05.41]I think I got everything.
[232:14.13]I am taking my sweet ass time, dudes.
[232:18.49]My friends, I am going to take my time here.
[232:30.61]He's throwing me through the hole.
[232:32.71]Where are you going?
[232:37.48]Where are you going?
[232:38.10]Where are you?
[232:39.12]Where is he going?
[232:39.78]Where is he going?
[232:40.48]Where is he going?
[232:41.22]Where is he going?
[233:11.88]I swear to God.
[233:13.78]I swear to God.
[233:15.24]I'm not having any of this.
[233:16.82]I'm concentrating.
[233:22.34]This is as concentrated as I could be.
[233:24.30]Turn the light off.
[233:30.98]This sucks.
[233:34.24]This sucks.
[233:37.58]Thank God I got a checkpoint.
[233:39.20]Oh, man.
[233:39.68]I can relax a little now.
[233:42.90]I can take my time.
[233:43.78]Okay.
[233:50.46]Over here.
[234:00.98]Where is he?
[234:01.94]No, that's where I was before.
[234:03.12]I am now on the top level.
[234:05.71]So sometimes they come up here.
[234:10.07]I hear him.
[234:11.03]Where is he?
[234:11.83]Which tunnel is he in?
[234:15.21]I'm not sure.
[234:19.90]We're okay.
[234:22.62]What was that noise?
[234:23.20]What was that noise?
[234:30.40]What was that noise?
[234:32.61]You've got to be kidding me.
[234:33.37]Should I shoot him?
[234:33.87]Do I shoot him?
[234:38.06]Wait, should I go?
[234:39.98]Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[234:41.14]Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[234:49.64]Ah.
[234:51.42]Ah, ah, ah.
[234:53.36]Ah, ah, ah.
[235:02.46]Okay.
[235:03.46]Okay.
[235:05.22]Just stay there.
[235:06.74]I get it.
[235:07.20]I get it.
[235:07.90]I understand.
[235:09.64]This is just SCP containment breach.
[235:12.30]Just don't follow any holes.
[235:14.22]I gotta move him.
[235:15.08]I need to move him.
[235:20.66]Is there one behind me?
[235:25.04]He's not gonna come around the corner, is he?
[235:30.29]Stay away from the walls.
[235:32.59]I gotta get down here.
[235:33.88]Straight ahead.
[235:34.32]Alright, we're good.
[235:44.68]Hi!
[235:46.51]I said hi!
[235:47.19]I said hi!
[235:48.23]I said hi right in his face!
[235:50.17]What?
[235:51.27]That's not what you do.
[235:52.01]Was that guy just an idiot?
[235:55.69]Damn it.
[236:14.35]Which way was it?
[236:15.07]It's over here.
[236:18.39]Yeah, that's fine.
[236:19.17]Get out of my face.
[236:19.69]Go.
[236:20.05]Quickly.
[236:22.17]Quickly, quickly, quickly.
[236:23.01]I need to loot him.
[236:31.62]Okay, we got a loot there.
[236:32.53]We got a loot.
[236:32.93]We got a loot.
[236:33.39]We got a loot.
[236:37.79]That's fine.
[236:38.61]Fuck off.
[236:40.23]Here he comes.
[236:41.13]Here comes two of them.
[236:43.09]This is where it teaches you this is what you need to do.
[236:52.82]So, if you don't look in his face... Okay, that's what it is.
[236:55.72]You need to look right... You can't be close.
[236:59.57]And you need to look right in the face.
[237:02.25]And then eventually they'll run away.
[237:03.97]They don't like being looked at.
[237:05.45]Okay.
[237:05.99]That's... Give me a break.
[237:07.73]Why did you... There's no reason to do that.
[237:09.58]Let's wait until he moves.
[237:14.58]He's gonna go down there.
[237:15.50]And then I go... I gotta go this way.
[237:18.30]Here he comes again.
[237:20.18]This is what screwed me last time.
[237:23.66]Get out of the way.
[237:27.86]Go!
[237:28.06]Go!
[237:30.99]Go on.
[237:32.85]I'm not afraid of you.
[237:35.83]You don't scare me.
[237:37.47]How come it's not working?
[237:39.26]Why is it not working?
[237:41.02]Does it only work for a certain amount of time?
[237:46.86]Did you see that?
[237:48.00]He's like, oh, well, whatever.
[237:49.19]I'm fine.
[237:49.65]Fuck you.
[237:50.09]He's like, eh, that's fine.
[238:01.76]Shit.
[238:05.86]I'm gonna get in here.
[238:10.12]Anything?
[238:10.44]No, don't stand near the walls.
[238:16.67]Don't stand near the wall.
[238:17.89]That's a wall.
[238:20.31]I need to take a gas.
[238:27.08]Where?
[238:28.00]Where is he?
[238:30.59]You dumb motherfucker you stupid imbecile dumb idiot moron stupid idiot streamer.
[238:35.69]I'm at the very beginning of the game I'm at the very beginning of the level.
[238:39.99]Oh my god.
[238:41.68]I'm so a man.
[238:49.88]Oh You dumb idiot, oh you idiot.
[238:52.08]Oh
[239:03.31]Do your thing.
[239:03.87]I'm so annoyed right now.
[239:11.29]I'm just full of anger at the moment.
[239:17.31]I'm just going to run by him.
[239:19.13]Hey!
[239:27.84]Move.
[239:30.36]What are you doing?
[239:32.18]Get out of here.
[239:34.86]Don't be so hard on yourself.
[239:37.61]I was at the end of the game there.
[239:41.37]I was done.
[239:42.11]It was over.
[239:44.35]Left straight.
[239:45.53]Right when he goes down, we're going.
[239:46.53]Here we go.
[239:47.09]Bingo.
[239:52.31]Bingo.
[239:55.71]What happened?
[239:56.83]Oh, okay.
[239:57.51]No, this is not... Is this a cutscene?
[239:59.21]This is a proper cutscene, right?
[240:02.03]Yes, it is.
[240:11.77]Oh, now I want to eat you now.
[240:17.29]He was just waiting for him to turn around.
[240:18.59]You have to look at him.
[240:19.27]He's going to pull his head off.
[240:22.61]Nope.
[240:23.73]Hey, that's a good view up here.
[240:32.42]They're just puppets.
[240:33.94]That's all they are.
[240:37.38]Just a bunch of muppets.
[240:45.93]Now what?
[240:46.47]I need to go the other way.
[240:50.81]Is there another one here?
[240:51.77]Why are you... You know what?
[240:57.59]I'm okay with how that turned out.
[240:58.85]I'm alright with how that turned out.
[241:03.67]I think I have to go down that.
[241:04.63]I'm just going to check and see if there's any items or anything there is.
[241:08.01]Can I get your face mask?
[241:12.52]I think that's all that's down here.
[241:17.00]New mask.
[241:18.43]Down the elevator shaft.
[241:19.53]And let's keep on moving.
[241:22.27]Right?
[241:24.69]No.
[241:28.77]So, that's interesting.
[241:33.61]I can just open the door.
[241:35.31]It's been so long since I've been able to open a door.
[241:39.71]I've had to karate chop them.
[241:41.89]The last hour.
[241:54.33]You can open doors?
[241:55.99]I'm not done with it.
[241:56.71]There's still more of this.
[241:57.96]I'm so not okay with this.
[242:03.60]There is a red lantern here, though, to explode.
[242:05.84]Are they fighting over something?
[242:11.82]Kind of.
[242:12.12]I ain't gonna get stuck in a spider web.
[242:16.54]That's for damn sure.
[242:17.30]I want to loot that guy.
[242:30.85]I want to loot this guy's... Is he gonna do the same thing?
[242:33.79]I'm gonna get him right in the butt cheek, right?
[242:35.71]Right like in the powder toastpan ass.
[242:40.30]That went right up his butt.
[242:42.00]Okay.
[242:48.77]That just made him really angry.
[242:53.17]Hey, wait.
[242:55.47]Dude, what the... I didn't even get a chance.
[243:03.24]I deserved that?
[243:04.00]Yeah, I did.
[243:12.61]Still angry after the game loaded.
[243:14.42]That's perfect.
[243:17.34]Come on.
[243:21.84]I wonder if he can... No.
[243:23.24]I don't think he's going to get up.
[243:27.98]No.
[243:28.24]Alright.
[243:28.80]Let me do... Why does it... Does it not work on these guys?
[243:33.13]No, it does.
[243:33.51]Oh, whoops.
[243:38.77]They're afraid of fire.
[243:42.93]They're scared of fire.
[243:50.58]He cut me off.
[243:51.46]He's smart.
[243:53.26]I'm looking at you.
[243:54.32]You shouldn't be doing this.
[243:55.22]I'm staring at you.
[243:57.42]I'm staring at you.
[243:58.62]Don't you understand?
[243:59.24]You can't... Alright.
[244:09.11]That guy doesn't have anything on him worth taking.
[244:10.83]So we're gonna go buy them both.
[244:15.28]I will commend him on sneaking by me, though.
[244:17.16]That was hilarious.
[244:18.42]Loud.
[244:18.74]I'm sorry.
[244:21.50]You can't share this snack.
[244:23.34]This is my snack.
[244:26.94]Fine.
[244:28.64]Here, get out of here.
[244:38.75]I don't think he gets up for anything.
[244:42.18]Spiderwebs.
[244:43.20]Spiderwebs.
[244:45.24]Oh, spiderwebs.
[244:47.25]A poem.
[244:49.33]By Truman985.
[244:50.09]Did I loot that?
[244:57.05]I think I did.
[244:59.37]Alright.
[244:59.97]Let's go this way.
[245:04.51]He's gonna get up and move, isn't he?
[245:06.14]I would assume.
[245:07.24]I guess not.
[245:08.98]Weird.
[245:09.96]That's a fall!
[245:10.28]That's a fall!
[245:19.55]I'm okay.
[245:21.01]I think I'm alright.
[245:22.13]We just need to get... Oh my fucking god.
[245:24.74]Why?
[245:26.06]Get up.
[245:31.18]I don't want to look at the clipboard right now.
[245:34.00]No, put it all down.
[245:38.78]No, I'm okay.
[245:39.60]I think that was supposed to happen.
[245:46.70]He's gonna jump up right here.
[245:49.56]Nope.
[245:50.74]He's currently fucking with something over there.
[245:52.24]Which way do I want to go?
[245:52.94]Straight?
[245:54.60]That way.
[245:58.54]Wait!
[246:04.00]What?
[246:11.94]This way?
[246:12.30]This way?
[246:12.70]This way?
[246:12.98]I think we're gonna go this way.
[246:19.15]Is he chasing me up the stairs?
[246:22.93]He can't make it all the way up here.
[246:24.35]I'm certain of it.
[246:25.01]He's too big to go up the stairs.
[246:26.81]Huh?
[246:27.43]Is there another guy?
[246:28.07]Okay.
[246:32.56]From here, we need to go up and around.
[246:35.06]Guys, I have no idea what the hell I'm doing.
[246:39.66]Where is he?
[246:46.22]I want to get over there.
[246:49.50]I can go that way, but I want to get these items.
[246:52.41]Shit.
[246:53.93]I can't, like, stick my head out, like, and... Wow.
[247:03.39]He can't figure it out, right?
[247:04.71]I can't get those items.
[247:05.57]Those items are a lost cause.
[247:06.48]We just gotta go.
[247:07.98]So I'm gonna go up here and in this door.
[247:11.06]Oh, no, you don't.
[247:18.76]Oh my lord, I'm so fucking scared.
[247:22.22]Okay, he can't get up there.
[247:25.99]In here.
[247:35.97]Nothing.
[247:36.35]Just make sure I don't miss any items.
[247:39.93]A shoe.
[247:42.56]What was that?
[247:45.37]Oh, it was the shoe.
[247:47.89]In before one breaks through one of these grades.
[247:49.77]It's gonna happen.
[247:50.55]I told you.
[247:51.01]I told you it was gonna happen.
[247:52.33]What was that?
[248:12.58]Anything else this way?
[248:15.11]No, it's just a bunch of electricity.
[248:22.79]Keep moving, and we gotta eventually get down that way.
[248:30.39]Why is this place such a maze?
[248:32.54]And why are there weird gorilla people in here?
[248:39.66]Gotta go that way.
[248:42.53]I'm assuming there's probably a wraparound.
[248:44.21]Yes, there is.
[248:47.33]Oh, shit.
[248:49.19]This one's depressed.
[248:52.93]Wait.
[249:00.92]Snoozy Loose.
[249:01.96]Snoozy Loose, bye.
[249:03.14]Snoozy Loose!
[249:11.53]Is he coming?
[249:12.93]Is he coming?
[249:14.21]He's coming.
[249:18.32]Is he coming?
[249:19.94]He's coming!
[249:20.28]He's coming!
[249:20.62]He's coming!
[249:20.92]Do I have to sweat off my face?
[249:38.46]Oh, you don't have a gas mask I can take from you?
[249:40.93]A new one?
[249:41.37]One that's not broken?
[249:43.45]Well, this one's asleep.
[249:46.80]No.
[249:47.70]No jokes.
[249:49.60]I can't do any jokes here.
[249:51.14]I'm sorry, guys.
[249:52.88]As badly as I want to do a funny joke... Wait, there's a key.
[249:59.02]This is just like every video game I've ever played.
[250:00.67]Once I take the key, he's gonna wake up.
[250:03.85]Nope.
[250:10.63]Wow.
[250:11.71]They didn't do every video game trope ever.
[250:14.57]Usually when you grab the key, he's like, who's there?
[250:17.21]Who took my key?
[250:39.58]Oh, the air is clean in here.
[250:48.46]Well, I do have a key now.
[250:52.67]Key?
[250:53.59]Is there a... Is this safe in here?
[250:54.95]Yes, there is.
[250:57.81]What's in there?
[250:58.39]Bunch of random stuff.
[251:02.82]Good thing I picked up the key.
[251:14.57]I can hear one.
[251:15.17]Is this door not open?
[251:25.80]I can't get in here.
[251:26.40]I can't kick this open.
[251:28.28]What's the keypad?
[251:31.76]Shit.
[251:36.78]Let's give it a go.
[251:43.38]Here are the archives.
[251:47.98]Which one is it?
[251:51.66]I came all the way here to go to a PO box to get my mail.
[251:55.78]And all it was was just a coupon book.
[252:00.22]What a waste of resources, by the way.
[252:02.12]Do you guys get those giant newspaper coupon books that show you what's at the grocery store?
[252:07.10]I think we talked about this before.
[252:09.06]See, now I'm going in other people's mail.
[252:25.21]I think I found it.
[252:27.53]No, apparently I didn't.
[252:31.43]There it is!
[252:31.85]There it is!
[252:35.65]The Manifesto!
[252:36.51]The monster is going to be right behind the door.
[252:46.40]That would have been funny.
[252:52.50]Why do I have no control?
[252:54.95]I couldn't open that with my hands before?
[252:56.55]I couldn't just get out?
[252:58.39]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[252:58.99]Okay, well, we did it.
[253:08.74]Okay.
[253:18.56]Well, it looks like I need the mask back on.
[253:21.96]He missed an opportunity to make a D6 bingo joke.
[253:28.75]That's it.
[253:29.49]Bingo.
[253:34.35]Are we just in a permanent cutscene right now?
[253:41.39]Uh-oh.
[253:42.95]The last one.
[253:49.56]Get in!
[253:51.99]Fifty bullets.
[253:52.33]Yes.
[253:52.47]Now I get to control the machine gun and shoot a bunch of gorillas.
[254:27.14]Why are we all loading in?
[254:28.06]This is kind of uncomfortable.
[254:31.75]We're all loading into the same car?
[254:34.53]Three people up in the front seat of a truck?
[254:37.75]It was room.
[254:41.46]We're very clearly going to drive into something.
[254:44.92]No, I... Here we are.
[254:51.01]Oh, he's sitting on my lap.
[254:55.99]That's Steve Blum again.
[254:56.95]Always Steve Blum.
[254:57.55]Every time.
[254:57.91]That's a lot of guns.
[255:25.01]Pick whatever you like.
[255:25.89]Are you kidding me?
[255:31.33]Take anything you want.
[255:33.43]Take anything you want.
[255:34.15]I want that one.
[255:37.56]Oh.
[255:38.00]What do I have for, um... Replay?
[255:38.94]Uh...
[255:51.88]Okay, let's think about this here.
[255:53.50]This must be the end of the game then.
[255:57.10]Okay, so I kind of want the minigun.
[256:04.05]Minigun?
[256:05.63]Hellbreath?
[256:11.33]I think I'm going to get this thing.
[256:13.00]Yeah, let's get this one.
[256:15.76]And let's replace this one.
[256:17.10]Let's get the Kalash.
[256:17.74]Kalash.
[256:22.39]This is my only time I'm going to get a chance to use them.
[256:24.91]Okay, barrel.
[256:26.29]Muzzle break.
[256:28.75]Decreases recoil.
[256:30.93]It's free.
[256:33.95]Laser sight.
[256:36.09]And... Full auto.
[256:44.67]Well, what was the point of me having any... I can just put on anything I want.
[256:51.28]Okay, we're going to put on the reflex sight.
[256:55.50]Silencer.
[256:57.47]No, I don't need a silencer.
[256:58.73]And the last game.
[257:03.27]No.
[257:04.15]The last part of the game, we're not going to use that.
[257:07.77]Alright.
[257:12.32]Cool.
[257:13.08]So do I have all the ammo I need now?
[257:16.52]Is there any special ammo?
[257:17.76]Do I have like full ammo?
[257:18.90]No.
[257:22.94]I have to assume, right?
[257:27.96]I guess.
[257:29.92]I can't see why I wouldn't have full ammo for everything.
[257:38.93]Use the revolver and the pump gun.
[257:41.61]No.
[257:42.77]This is the only opportunity I'm going to get to use my insanity weapons.
[257:47.20]You're good at that.
[257:49.22]Anything else?
[257:52.78]Something else up here that I didn't see.
[257:56.81]There is a guy up here.
[257:57.65]Oh, it's that guy from the beginning.
[258:08.25]Okay, okay, okay.
[258:09.39]There's not much useful in here.
[258:11.01]Just hints at most.
[258:12.57]What do you mean, railgun?
[258:14.10]Well, we're going back down.
[258:16.24]I guess I'm ready.
[258:23.11]Is this door gonna open?
[258:25.67]Watch me just burn through ammo.
[258:27.23]I'm missing out on good boy points?
[258:30.75]Why?
[258:30.89]Let's do it.
[258:31.19]Let's just try it.
[258:31.85]Let's go for it.
[258:32.59]How do I get out of here?
[258:55.76]Let's go.
[259:01.63]How do I go?
[259:01.95]Let's go.
[259:02.63]Did I...
[259:15.05]Okay, let's listen.
[259:15.74]I can't wait to use my new minigun.
[259:17.30]Hopefully it's good.
[259:19.54]I need to go into the Jesus door.
[259:21.08]Um... I'm sorry, but...
[259:40.84]Your little seance machine over here is a hubcap.
[259:44.24]A melted hubcap with birthday candles in it.
[259:46.36]It's kind of... That's kind of disrespectful.
[259:49.57]Just gonna say.
[259:50.51]You couldn't find like a... You couldn't find like a soap dish?
[259:54.15]Anything like that?
[259:57.55]Let's go.
[260:01.68]Alright, fine.
[260:05.00]What do you have to say?
[260:06.36]Why did I... I didn't even get to see anything.
[260:09.85]It gave me a choice.
[260:10.55]It gave me a choice and I pressed E. I don't even know what it was.
[260:14.41]What was the choice?
[260:14.99]I don't know.
[260:18.81]Apparently it was, are you ready?
[260:20.73]I think we're going downstairs.
[260:38.18]Well, Artyom, I've been chatting here for far too long.
[260:43.22]It's time to go.
[260:45.52]You just chose to join the harvesters.
[260:55.17]Alright.
[260:56.57]Give me the ending scene here.
[261:00.67]I'm looking forward to it.
[261:15.89]We all sure take our time down here, don't we?
[261:22.14]Can I go to the front of the line?
[261:26.98]It's the old church dungeon.
[261:30.26]Church dungeon?
[261:31.08]It's the first cigarette we've seen all game.
[261:36.81]Oh, we don't even get to see him smoke it.
[261:46.00]Be patient.
[261:56.78]I'm being patient.
[261:57.50]The smell of clean death air.
[261:58.36]Let's be quiet for the final cutscene.
[261:59.80]You throw the firewood in, and here come the aliens.
[262:26.41]This is when I finally have my mental breakdown.
[262:31.74]Alright.
[262:33.30]This is where I have to make a decision.
[262:54.47]I have to pick the dark side or the light side.
[262:57.66]There's two ways to go.
[263:05.06]I'm gonna listen to the voice.
[263:09.92]Yes, I choose the aliens.
[263:26.45]Where's the alien?
[263:29.79]I'm coming.
[263:30.19]Why is this the bad end?
[263:41.35]What are you talking about?
[263:42.25]He's trying to lighten his face.
[263:52.44]Yeah.
[263:52.78]I'm gonna have to follow a guide.
[264:03.59]Save scum.
[264:05.19]When did I save scum?
[264:06.29]Do I get to use a flamethrower?
[264:21.95]I hope so.
[264:23.57]Don't worry, the bad ending is canon.
[264:25.19]Well, there you go.
[264:26.55]There we are.
[264:27.01]I've been waiting all game to use this.
[264:29.33]You have to pump it up.
[264:55.54]Pump it up.
[265:02.93]We gotta wait till they close.
[265:11.72]How far does the fire go?
[265:12.62]It doesn't go that far.
[265:19.72]How much ammo do I have with this thing?
[265:23.20]3A to 2D.
[265:23.62]Is this guy playing chess?
[265:33.35]He used the airblast.
[265:36.03]I think I'm causing a little bit of a problem.
[265:40.31]4A to D1.
[265:42.81]Checkmate.
[265:55.85]I'm causing too many particles.
[265:57.75]Did I just burn myself?
[265:59.13]I burnt myself.
[266:00.31]No, I didn't.
[266:01.01]Did I?
[266:01.81]How?
[266:03.33]I burnt the ground.
[266:06.60]Wait.
[266:08.86]No, that doesn't... Yes, it does.
[266:10.38]Yes, it does.
[266:11.30]Okay, you can't actually... You can't actually burn yourself.
[266:15.95]So don't... You gotta be very careful here.
[266:18.05]Ignore it.
[266:26.73]So we're just gonna go like this.
[266:28.61]Don't even let them walk through the tunnel.
[266:39.42]Oh, come on!
[266:41.88]I'm on fire!
[266:45.87]Just, just, why?
[266:48.08]Why?
[266:49.02]Come on.
[266:51.04]No.
[266:51.92]It's just a flame in front of me.
[266:56.04]Oh my god, dude.
[267:04.43]I can't, I can walk?
[267:05.79]Oh, I can walk.
[267:08.87]I thought it was on rails.
[267:10.61]I thought it was on rails.
[267:11.55]Give me a break.
[267:11.99]I thought it was on rails.
[267:12.99]Hold on.
[267:17.14]Yeah, just, I'm gonna have to redo it again.
[267:25.33]Come on, I gotta pump it.
[267:33.35]Burn their arms.
[267:41.98]I can't leave the boat.
[267:46.70]Get out of here!
[267:48.06]Get out of here you fucking little shit!
[268:02.49]Get out of here!
[268:03.69]Off the boat!
[268:04.91]Get off the cruise!
[268:11.16]I'm causing way more damage to this thing.
[268:14.21]I'm doing way more harm than good.
[268:18.05]Oh my!
[268:19.17]God damn it!
[268:29.33]I want to put this thing down.
[268:32.43]I can't leave.
[268:33.29]It won't let me get off.
[268:36.53]It won't let me get off.
[268:37.65]I can't get off.
[268:41.91]I'm just gonna go like this.
[268:42.73]I'm not gonna... Why?
[268:56.86]Why?
[268:57.34]I didn't move.
[268:57.92]I didn't fucking move.
[269:00.47]Why of all... Why?
[269:02.73]I didn't move.
[269:04.99]I wasn't fucking moving.
[269:15.05]Fire again.
[269:22.18]I have my other guns.
[269:24.46]Why have I not used my other guns?
[269:48.36]Pump it up!
[269:56.57]I got it.
[269:57.19]I got it.
[269:57.99]It overheats and blows up.
[269:59.15]What do you mean it overheats and blows up?
[270:01.81]Okay, just reload this.
[270:12.04]We're fine.
[270:17.06]Got it.
[270:18.68]I just saved us all.
[270:20.81]We made it.
[270:24.19]Well, I wouldn't want to be there now.
[270:32.19]I don't want to keep this thing.
[270:34.84]I don't want to get rid of this.
[270:37.98]Okay, what's the safe play here?
[270:39.82]The safe play is get rid of the machine gun shotgun.
[270:44.68]There's a long road ahead.
[270:47.50]No, I'm keeping this thing.
[270:50.82]Here's what we're going to do.
[270:54.17]We're going to use this and keep the flamethrower.
[270:58.11]We're doing barbecue strats, guys.
[271:10.40]Okay.
[271:17.04]Alright, we've broken through.
[271:18.44]Let's do this fast and smooth.
[271:20.76]Fast and smooth.
[271:23.37]Boris and Stepan, you cover the comedian.
[271:26.55]Artem, Vladimir, stay close to me.
[271:29.14]Am I the comedian?
[271:29.96]Okay, guys, let's do it.
[271:31.95]When did Tommy Wiseau get into this game?
[271:35.01]Let's do it.
[271:36.47]Give me all that stuff.
[271:37.73]Sounds good.
[271:38.21]So this is the break into the alien fortress and get rid of the aliens.
[271:42.51]Got it.
[272:03.81]Was everybody ready?
[272:06.11]I don't think everyone was ready.
[272:08.03]This reminds me of the first part of the game.
[272:10.37]Is this the first part of the game?
[272:11.86]This is the first challenge, guys.
[272:13.08]I did not.
[272:13.34]It's broken.
[272:36.69]Let's go.
[272:44.47]Now what, genius?
[272:52.98]Hey, genius.
[272:54.64]What room?
[272:54.90]Take a look at that room.
[272:56.78]Thanks a lot, genius.
[273:11.94]Don't worry, I got it.
[273:14.10]I'll repower the whole entire complex.
[273:16.34]Genius.
[273:28.43]Okay.
[273:32.78]Let's try it again.
[273:37.39]How's that, Einstein?
[273:38.73]Oh, wait, does he not... Okay, I thought I actually just burned him.
[273:47.62]I was actually scared about that.
[273:48.58]Alright, men, move up.
[273:50.38]Let's go, go, go, go, go.
[273:52.54]Safety.
[273:52.98]Watch those languages.
[274:01.13]it's not a sign it's an omen if there is then something lifted him something was here it's probably one of those big gorillas where is he okay watch the vents I'm gonna just keep my eye on this vent I got this vent apparently nobody nobody's paying attention all clear look here offense is the best defense vladimir stay with them you both stay back
[274:33.41]We have to stay back.
[274:36.89]So we have a series of bad rooms.
[274:45.31]Oh, skeleton.
[274:47.97]You got anything else on you?
[274:50.37]Nice.
[274:52.69]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[274:53.33]Just hold on.
[274:53.75]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[274:54.35]Hold on, hold on.
[274:54.85]Hold that thought.
[274:59.88]You guys didn't want me to bring the flamethrower.
[275:02.08]What were you thinking?
[275:02.76]You guys didn't want me to bring this?
[275:09.68]It's just annihilation.
[275:10.96]Nobody can even come near me.
[275:12.04]It's perfect.
[275:14.89]Just burn everything.
[275:19.79]Watch this vent.
[275:21.23]Preliminary burn vent.
[275:22.89]Hey!
[275:25.53]What's going on?
[275:26.45]Plug it in.
[275:39.22]It's empty.
[275:40.06]Why is it empty?
[275:41.90]Do I need to pump it again?
[275:42.60]I just reloaded the thing!
[275:49.70]I just reloaded this!
[275:59.92]So, there's nothing in here.
[276:02.94]Oh, that's fantastic.
[276:04.50]What the hell was that?
[276:12.56]Twice, twice, twice.
[276:13.38]Go, go, go, go, go.
[276:14.06]Mm-hmm.
[276:21.44]Another room.
[276:22.06]This time, I'm gonna stick around in, like, the corner.
[276:25.57]Top right corner.
[276:27.19]Well, I angrily just threw that.
[276:28.87]Get out of the way, dummy!
[276:34.89]I'm using... I'm using funny bullets, I think.
[276:37.60]Yeah, I am.
[276:37.94]I don't want to use funny bullets right now, but, you know, I'm not gonna switch it out yet.
[276:48.54]There's no time to switch him up.
[276:54.01]This gun is great.
[277:02.09]Why did I not get this early on?
[277:03.33]Keep going, keep going.
[277:13.06]Just give me... I can't get any more gas tanks for the flamethrower?
[277:22.04]You can't even buy anything else, so why even care?
[277:27.75]Monster behind the door.
[277:29.09]It's pretty clear.
[277:35.53]What?
[277:36.93]Hold on, am I not supposed to be opening this yet?
[277:45.14]I think I did this cutscene a little too quickly.
[277:48.55]Oh boy.
[277:49.21]He's gonna get his face ripped off.
[277:55.79]Whoops.
[277:59.49]Oops-a-daisy.
[278:00.19]Take his ship.
[278:04.10]Don't let him die in vain.
[278:05.06]Take his mask.
[278:07.42]Stepan.
[278:08.48]Stepan, that's enough.
[278:11.40]You can't help him, Stepan.
[278:12.84]Let's go.
[278:13.22]Okay, we got a locker over here.
[278:16.26]I can't open.
[278:16.64]Did I get it?
[278:17.06]Yep, here we go.
[278:18.04]Reload, baby.
[278:18.98]Pump it up.
[278:22.36]Okay, go for it.
[278:40.95]I'm not going to use that.
[278:42.08]I'm going to use the flamethrower later.
[278:45.06]That's an absolute desperation panic mode to pull the flamethrower.
[278:53.24]Streamer's door opening addiction kills man.
[278:55.90]I mean, all these guys are going down.
[279:03.78]You don't think that at least four more of these guys are going to die.
[279:06.39]I mean, half these guys wouldn't even get to know their names, so they're definitely dead.
[279:12.07]Alright, which one of these guys told me their name?
[279:14.57]Because they're safe.
[279:16.90]I don't think that guy told me his name, so he's definitely going to die.
[279:20.00]This guy's gone.
[279:21.72]Guaranteed.
[279:22.10]There's more fuel.
[279:29.39]Anything else?
[279:34.53]A lock and a heal.
[279:40.10]We're good.
[279:42.08]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[279:46.98]That guy's got a sack of coins.
[279:51.55]I'll be taking that from him when the time is right.
[279:55.75]Okay.
[279:58.61]It's the comedy squad.
[280:06.32]Well, if I was a room to fill with enemies, it would be this one.
[280:09.88]Still no 1080p 60fps.
[280:10.56]My internet's not good enough to do that.
[280:41.14]I need a much better internet provider to be able to do that.
[280:46.87]That requires me to do like 6 or 7, probably like 8,000 of them.
[280:51.47]If you're gonna do 1080p 60fps, you better be running your bitrate at like at least 6 to 10,000.
[280:56.51]Otherwise, it looks terrible, like just awful.
[281:02.05]Well, we got no bullets in that gun.
[281:09.72]This thing's already empty?
[281:10.82]What?
[281:12.68]What are you talking about?
[281:13.68]What?
[281:18.29]Why is it spraying one tiny little spray?
[281:25.33]Alright, I was gonna say... Forget about the comrades.
[281:34.48]It's empty.
[281:36.14]This is bad.
[281:36.90]I have no bullets.
[281:41.06]Why?
[281:41.74]You only get to spray it for fucking one second?
[281:46.30]New gun.
[281:51.52]Unbelievable.
[281:58.81]Give it to me!
[282:06.24]You guys are shitting me right now.
[282:12.51]Oh my fucking god.
[282:13.51]Oh my god, I can't see.
[282:21.56]Is my mask not on?
[282:23.00]What's going on?
[282:24.94]Okay, no, it's fine.
[282:27.12]Okay.
[282:29.24]Is there any other things I can pick up?
[282:32.41]Because, man, I'm desperate right now.
[282:40.01]No.
[282:42.51]No, I'm just getting beeps.
[282:43.33]That's fine.
[282:43.89]Let's go.
[282:47.16]Well, we're going to have to use the gun that has actual ammo.
[282:51.86]I'm loading in the money gun.
[282:53.62]No, I can't even do that.
[282:56.75]Looks like we're going to be throwing knives, men.
[282:59.91]In about 25 seconds.
[283:03.53]It's locked.
[283:07.53]I need to have an internet that can do like 20 megabits up.
[283:13.25]20 to 30 up if I want to do like a 10,000 bitrate stream that's 1080p.
[283:21.78]I just can't get that kind of internet.
[283:24.72]I would have to move to be able to stream like a full 1080p 60fps like 10,000 bitrate stream.
[283:36.41]You want to press a button or something?
[283:45.16]Oh.
[283:45.32]I had to do a 10,000p stream.
[283:49.73]And plus, my internet is so unreliable, even what I'm supposed to be paying for, that I don't think I would even ever want to comfortably do a, like, 10,000 bitrate stream.
[284:01.79]I'm just going to be a 720x60 loser until I can figure it out.
[284:08.36]I hear people.
[284:09.74]That's a new enemy.
[284:10.34]That's a cobra.
[284:11.66]That's like a king cobra scorpion.
[284:14.48]I'm playing Ring Around the Rosie with him.
[284:15.69]Where do you go?
[284:21.49]Anything else in here?
[284:22.37]Peel and take it.
[284:26.49]Full on everything.
[284:30.34]Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[284:32.74]No, I'm going to keep this.
[284:33.52]I'm going to take the ammo out of that, though.
[284:34.98]Give me that ammo.
[284:36.48]Beautiful.
[284:37.85]Oh, absolutely beautiful.
[284:39.77]Perfect.
[284:40.25]Beautiful.
[284:47.19]Where is he?
[284:47.85]He's above me somewhere.
[284:48.81]Why am I going so slow?
[284:59.17]There we go.
[285:03.48]Alright, I get it.
[285:04.06]It's two shots to kill one of these.
[285:06.18]It's cool.
[285:20.17]I have... Ha!
[285:21.77]Will you go away?
[285:24.75]Go away.
[285:25.57]Go away.
[285:28.57]Go away!
[285:29.75]Go away!
[285:30.21]I gotta go.
[285:31.51]Go away!
[285:34.54]Go away!
[285:46.69]Did I come back to the original room?
[285:47.97]I did.
[285:48.31]What the hell am I doing?
[285:50.77]Oh my lord.
[285:51.63]I'm just getting turned around.
[285:54.75]Shit.
[285:58.95]That was just moving.
[286:01.24]Kids can break.
[286:05.83]I don't have a key or anything, nope.
[286:11.35]What's my flashlight doing?
[286:19.35]That's better.
[286:26.14]That's a noise I... What is going on down here?
[286:31.56]Are there people down there?
[286:34.40]Let me find the key first.
[286:35.66]Key?
[286:35.74]No, turn... You can do it as a Play-Doh.
[286:53.38]That noise reminds me of something I know.
[286:54.62]I can't put my finger on it.
[286:55.56]That's disgusting.
[287:03.40]Come on, there's gonna be a key in this, right?
[287:08.94]Apparently not.
[287:11.52]Aha!
[287:14.60]Found it!
[287:15.00]That's a lot of stuff.
[287:29.93]Alright.
[287:31.09]I'm ready and willing to go this way.
[287:35.20]We have to go down the hole and find our friends.
[287:41.58]Friends?
[287:49.80]Oh, shit.
[287:53.98]Oh.
[287:58.50]They're everywhere.
[288:11.81]Sometimes you have to make sacrifices, and I just tried to make one right there.
[288:16.23]We're good.
[288:18.67]Alright, which tunnel is it?
[288:22.25]This one over here.
[288:25.07]Let's just make sure there's no items I'm missing.
[288:33.88]Doesn't seem like it.
[288:39.12]Light hurts them.
[288:42.05]Really.
[288:44.03]Like my flashlight hurts them.
[288:46.82]So one of those scenarios.
[288:47.72]Should I just walk around with the torch out?
[288:52.36]So I should just hold my hand out like this.
[289:06.24]Do I need the gas mask still?
[289:07.18]I don't think I need the mask on.
[289:13.91]No, I don't.
[289:21.97]That's good.
[289:30.09]More documents.
[289:40.38]Right this way, sir.
[289:44.17]I think I figured it out.
[289:46.33]This is where we all come in and we all party.
[289:49.39]It's gonna be a party.
[289:54.70]Well, not quite.
[289:55.28]This game sucks.
[289:57.78]What do you mean this game sucks?
[290:00.90]What do you mean this game sucks?
[290:02.14]What's wrong with this game?
[290:04.76]This game's fun.
[290:06.32]I really like this game.
[290:13.38]Did I do it?
[290:16.98]Here comes the last train.
[290:19.78]The final train.
[290:20.60]The last stop.
[290:41.49]Oh shit, it's a ghost train.
[290:44.08]Nobody in there.
[290:49.70]Looks like the beginning of Half-Life 2.
[290:53.79]And the end of Half-Life 2.
[290:56.33]Maybe we should get on it.
[290:57.25]Is there anything on the seats?
[291:11.94]Well, difficulty is on Ranger.
[291:14.97]This is on Ranger.
[291:25.39]Well, looks like we're taking it.
[291:35.08]Epic reference.
[291:36.44]-2.
[291:42.83]well so the next station is d6 okay let's go I'm ready is this bulletproof glass I hope so am I gonna play last light uh yes
[292:10.18]I find this game to be an enjoyable experience.
[292:15.29]So I would assume I would play Last Light as well.
[292:19.65]Maybe not immediately right after this.
[292:22.09]We'll take a break from Metro, but I definitely will play Last Light.
[292:28.91]We'll see what the deal is.
[292:29.91]I kind of want to see what we're looking at here.
[292:41.35]No, this is Redux.
[292:44.03]This is Redux.
[292:49.93]Well, that's really ugly.
[292:53.51]I'd rather turn it off.
[292:55.05]What is that supposed to mean?
[293:06.64]I did it on purpose.
[293:08.27]It was a joke.
[293:09.89]That's why I'm trying to make a joke about like, hey, especially you, Arthur.
[293:14.73]There, how clever.
[293:39.60]20 years.
[293:40.06]20 years!
[293:40.40]Who's talking?
[293:41.82]Is this the guy talking?
[294:09.50]This is the guy talking.
[294:12.64]New filter?
[294:13.10]I'm good.
[294:17.02]This is spooky.
[294:26.58]Spooky!
[294:33.56]He's got a cool gun.
[294:34.34]What is that thing?
[294:37.17]Green laser is so much cooler than a red laser.
[294:44.82]Red laser is so typical.
[294:45.88]Green laser is the new cool.
[294:51.06]You know, I imagined everything just as it is.
[294:55.21]There's something about these objects.
[294:56.79]They, uh... Why is everybody giving me -2?
[295:01.27]I'm stating... I'm... I'm... A joke?
[295:04.67]Why am I getting a -2 for just saying that I like the green laser more than the red laser?
[295:11.07]Wow, what a joke that was.
[295:12.93]Since when are my personal opinions...
[295:21.32]-2 jokes.
[295:23.62]I just said I like green lasers.
[295:29.71]I can't wait for -2 to be the first elimination in the Kill the Meme stream.
[295:37.34]This is going to be great.
[295:38.04]I can't wait.
[295:38.50]-2 is going to be the first.
[295:39.84]I hope it becomes eliminated first.
[295:47.48]Here's the train set.
[295:53.22]Green, your opinions are a joke.
[295:59.45]Come on, what?
[296:01.53]Don't give me this horse shit.
[296:07.64]Oh shit, his computer blue screen.
[296:11.42]Now that's a -2.
[296:12.40]Now you're allowed to do it.
[296:22.38]Oh, there's two ways to go?
[296:23.26]Just one way?
[296:23.76]There should be four starter motors.
[296:32.44]Mm-hmm.
[296:37.27]Okay.
[296:38.29]Is this one?
[296:38.99]No.
[296:41.71]Yeah, here they are.
[296:43.07]How do I start them?
[296:47.25]Oh.
[296:48.95]I can't do that out of order.
[296:51.70]Just open all their doors.
[296:53.85]So it's easy.
[296:54.81]So I'm going to go 1, 2, 3 without needing to do anything else.
[296:56.85]Here we go.
[296:57.23]1.
[297:00.17]Press what button?
[297:01.33]Oh.
[297:05.37]3rd button.
[297:09.28]Oh!
[297:13.76]What do we need next?
[297:27.60]This is so dumb.
[297:34.16]We good?
[297:38.06]Alright, let's leave.
[297:41.92]Way too fast.
[297:43.04]I'm going too fast.
[297:47.48]Alright, third button!
[297:49.16]Fourth button again!
[297:54.42]Start it up.
[298:00.28]What happened?
[298:09.61]Are we getting back on the train?
[298:15.41]Oh, shh.
[298:15.87]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[298:16.72]I gotta get on there.
[298:17.86]Oh god, I gotta get on there.
[298:20.68]I gotta get on that thing.
[298:26.02]Wait for me!
[298:26.40]Wait for me!
[298:27.50]Wait for me!
[298:28.62]Oh, thank God.
[298:29.24]I thought I had to jump.
[298:29.86]Alright, let's go.
[298:35.33]Let's go.
[298:39.99]Oh, here he comes.
[298:42.01]I was about to jump off the edge.
[298:48.09]Are we good?
[298:49.17]Wasn't there one more guy?
[298:54.40]There was one other person.
[298:58.36]How come I can't... Is he back?
[298:59.60]Oh, no.
[299:00.57]We left a guy back.
[299:01.29]Oh, he died.
[299:01.81]Oh.
[299:01.93]Who cares?
[299:30.63]Sure.
[299:30.77]I have to run all the way around and punch a bunch of buttons.
[299:33.13]I thought that just said, try me.
[299:37.83]Like those old toys.
[299:54.58]When you go to the toy store and you see it, you can press the button.
[299:56.80]You can reach in the plastic and press on the baby's hand and they laugh.
[300:01.29]I thought that's actually what that said.
[300:07.11]Apparently not.
[300:18.14]You didn't need my help, I guess.
[300:20.58]You're just going to figure it out.
[300:22.78]That's not going to kill me, is it?
[300:27.30]Nope, I just get to be inside of it.
[300:30.27]Cool.
[300:33.71]I can just pretend to be like the train conductor.
[300:38.17]Where is it gonna go?
[300:38.69]Oh.
[300:38.81]I don't know what the hell that was.
[300:45.33]What is that?
[300:45.79]What did I just get?
[300:46.43]It's like a red backpack in there.
[301:00.08]There's a long ending sequence here.
[301:01.74]That's for the flamethrower.
[301:02.56]Oh well.
[301:02.72]Why are all the HUD elements turned off?
[301:06.35]Because I'm playing on Ranger.
[301:26.67]excellent there is no hud on ranger I believe died second destroyed third fourth fifth eighth jockey that's just cannot be here here's one
[301:42.46]Now I'll get all the info.
[301:43.84]What the hell?
[301:44.76]What happened?
[301:46.10]Battery backup depleted.
[301:47.78]What about main power?
[301:48.72]What are they doing?
[301:49.46]Well, it looks like the reactor is deactivated.
[301:52.00]No, no.
[301:52.92]Oh, go start it manually.
[301:55.37]We need to start the reactor manually at the lowest level.
[301:57.49]Of course we do.
[301:58.95]From the schematic, it's not that difficult.
[302:01.35]Almost everything is automated.
[302:03.21]You tell me that, but it's gonna be.
[302:05.33]Hey, stop laughing.
[302:07.27]How do we go down?
[302:08.55]Well...
[302:10.09]There's a lift just one level down, but there's a slight problem.
[302:13.34]To power it up, we need to switch off everything, even emergency lighting.
[302:17.50]Then there is no other choice.
[302:20.02]Do it.
[302:20.66]Night vision time.
[302:21.84]Stay here and watch the readings.
[302:23.20]We'll be fast.
[302:23.86]Artyom, Olman, follow me.
[302:26.76]Turn it all off.
[302:36.54]What are these?
[302:38.38]Alright, so there are... Okay.
[302:43.01]Well... Wait, who am I supposed to follow?
[302:45.65]This guy.
[303:07.85]Ugh, I hate the Outlast mode.
[303:09.28]It's the worst.
[303:14.94]Is he doing the same thing?
[303:19.16]Is he doing flashlight or is he doing... No, okay, he's doing flashlight.
[303:21.69]I'm gonna do flashlight too.
[303:22.59]I don't want to be the one guy that needs to have Outlast mode turned on.
[303:43.67]Is this on Ranger?
[303:44.29]It's on Ranger.
[303:51.43]Good save point.
[303:52.09]Am I almost at the end?
[303:52.77]I'm not sure.
[303:53.23]I don't know.
[303:53.71]It's possible.
[303:54.89]What?
[303:55.01]Okay, these like snapdragons just all threw up on us.
[304:10.89]Okay.
[304:13.14]Well... That's some creepy Muppet bullshit going on over there.
[304:25.52]Don't get spit on.
[304:26.64]I have no ammo, by the way.
[304:28.00]I need to stop shooting.
[304:32.43]I'll let him do it.
[304:33.85]He'll take care of it.
[304:34.85]With your electricity automatic shotgun.
[304:36.69]That thing is amazing.
[304:37.89]Where did he get that?
[304:50.55]It's fine.
[304:50.91]These guys can't die, so he's gonna take every hit.
[304:56.09]I need to conserve ammo.
[305:00.51]The flashlight makes it worse.
[305:01.61]Alright, get this guy behind you.
[305:09.73]Run!
[305:10.07]Shoot it!
[305:12.05]Out of ammo.
[305:13.23]Perfect.
[305:18.52]Well, that's the reason why I didn't want to shoot anything, because now I have absolute zero ammo in that gun.
[305:23.50]It's all about the shotgun now, apparently.
[305:26.84]I'm gonna die.
[305:32.02]Okay, this is the lift.
[305:32.94]I hope it still works.
[305:34.42]Me too.
[305:35.88]Because I have no other way to defend myself.
[305:46.41]Anything else down here?
[305:47.17]Come on, give me something.
[305:54.09]Here comes the... That was Ullman.
[305:57.15]You guys are gonna laugh at that, but not at my terrible jokes.
[306:00.09]Everyone's laughing their ass off at that guy.
[306:22.76]That's so low effort.
[306:28.28]He's jealous.
[306:28.72]Of course I am.
[306:29.28]Of course I'm jealous.
[306:29.92]Yes, I am.
[306:31.20]I'm very jealous of this not real person in a video game.
[306:35.31]What are we doing now, huh?
[306:37.11]Vladimir, if only you could see that.
[306:41.05]Okay, get ready, Artyom.
[306:43.29]It's going to be hot.
[306:46.29]This shit on the floor is toxic for sure, and all the gas.
[306:50.61]We won't last long here.
[307:00.10]We won't last long here.
[307:02.04]So why don't we just run?
[307:04.00]Why are we tiptoeing through this area?
[307:06.90]Just run really fast through the whole place.
[307:16.19]You're walking as slow as possible for somebody that says we won't last down here.
[307:21.60]Me trying to waste all of our oxygen.
[307:31.38]Get it off!
[307:37.09]You've got to keep your shoes clean.
[307:38.79]Oh, I'm about to run by him.
[307:47.95]How many bullets do I even have left?
[307:49.19]I don't even know.
[307:49.95]Who knows?
[307:51.25]I can't even answer that question reliably right now.
[307:55.65]Something just spit on me.
[308:01.41]Flamethrower ammo.
[308:07.69]Charge the flashlight for a second.
[308:09.15]I agree.
[308:11.45]Whoa.
[308:21.88]Okay, where is the lever?
[308:23.30]The gas mask?
[308:24.10]Uh-huh.
[308:25.74]Good.
[308:26.34]Anything else?
[308:27.44]Doesn't seem like it.
[308:28.50]I knew you could do it.
[308:30.66]Colonel, the system is automated.
[308:32.18]Just enter the command.
[308:33.36]Sure.
[308:34.10]Easier said than done.
[308:35.72]Are we going to have to deal with the Ghostbusters too, Slime?
[308:39.14]Okay.
[308:40.50]Enter starter.
[308:42.48]One, two, three, four.
[308:44.55]Looks simple.
[308:45.99]They built it so even a fool could use it.
[308:49.41]Just pray to God it works.
[308:51.37]No, somebody's coming.
[308:52.35]She's at one quarter power.
[308:54.16]We need a full charge.
[308:55.28]Keep it going.
[308:56.12]You have to defend it.
[308:57.50]This is going to stand out.
[308:58.58]We won't do any better than that.
[309:01.28]I freaked out.
[309:03.56]Did I do that?
[309:05.18]I don't know.
[309:05.82]What the hell was that?
[309:07.92]Now this shit is fighting back.
[309:10.04]This gets worse every minute.
[309:11.88]I'm trying.
[309:14.06]Talk, talk, talk, talk.
[309:16.74]Manual activation system.
[309:18.90]Hydraulics.
[309:20.16]Shit.
[309:22.66]Get to the crane on the ceiling.
[309:24.08]Alright, here I go.
[309:25.62]It's gonna be so much fun.
[309:27.38]I can't wait to get all the way to the top of the crane.
[309:30.24]So I can help out my friends.
[309:50.12]wow this thing continues to throw stuff at me that's great climb up are you serious you fell he slipped off that's I got like this like monster slime all over me
[310:23.12]Get up there.
[310:28.10]I don't know why that was happening.
[310:29.18]I promise you.
[310:34.14]Drop the anvil on this monster's head.
[310:36.32]Imagine watching from over there this guy do that.
[310:45.20]I have to control this, don't I?
[310:46.66]Oh my god, I do.
[310:47.40]Okay, I didn't... I thought it was a joke.
[310:49.14]I actually do have to do this.
[310:55.35]I'm going to assume we have to go right over this and press the button.
[310:58.87]Grab it.
[310:59.14]What am I supposed to do?
[311:05.00]Yeah?
[311:05.34]And?
[311:05.56]What's the follow up there, lady?
[311:27.79]That's exactly what I just did.
[311:32.23]I did not change a thing.
[311:37.56]I'm gonna die.
[311:40.50]I'm gonna hit right in the face by one more bullet and I'm done.
[311:54.59]Almost.
[311:55.46]Come on, get into position.
[311:57.52]Hold it out.
[312:00.96]What's with the clown horn?
[312:03.80]Get it!
[312:04.16]Would you please get it?
[312:06.40]Why are you doing this?
[312:08.76]Oh my god.
[312:14.49]Alright.
[312:15.71]No, get me out of the crane!
[312:17.15]How do I get out of the crane?
[312:20.23]How do I get out of the crane?
[312:24.55]What do you mean, drag myself over here?
[312:30.57]I think it's scripted, right?
[312:31.97]I'm gonna be fine.
[312:33.79]Where's this manhole?
[312:38.49]What exactly?
[312:39.29]What exactly?
[312:40.63]There's a manhole.
[312:46.39]I can't even see the screen.
[312:57.37]Am I supposed to pull off the manhole?
[312:58.91]This would be less complicated if I could see what I was doing.
[313:20.21]He just said, come here with it.
[313:21.73]There's another clown horn.
[313:29.00]Go to the green zone.
[313:30.06]Look, if somebody didn't literally sneeze Cheeto dust in my fucking face.
[313:37.04]And yes, I stole that from somebody in chat.
[313:40.26]Deal with it.
[313:44.11]Except I added the sneeze part.
[313:45.93]That's half my joke, half his joke.
[313:51.39]Let's go.
[313:55.36]Oh, thank God.
[313:57.32]Thank God.
[313:58.12]Heal before I get spit on.
[314:03.12]Joke thief and joke stealer.
[314:06.66]Oh, he's plagiarizing.
[314:08.50]He's plagiarizing.
[314:09.59]That was my joke.
[314:27.53]I better see my name in the credits.
[314:31.97]Nah!
[314:32.31]Oh, that was an amazing joke.
[314:38.34]I really didn't like the sneeze part, though.
[314:40.12]I thought it was really bad.
[314:40.90]I'm so hungry right now.
[314:42.32]Anybody else hungry?
[315:01.20]Try not to laugh starting now.
[315:06.29]Okay.
[315:08.09]Try not to laugh.
[315:34.03]Why am I trying not to laugh?
[315:35.62]I'm already like about to laugh.
[315:43.94]Is there something in particular that I need to not laugh at?
[315:48.16]Okay.
[315:51.38]Let's keep it together.
[315:52.42]Artyom and I will go to Ostankino to correct the aim.
[315:55.55]You stay here and defend Vladimir.
[315:57.83]I won't guess our chances of making it, but try to reach our people and ask for backup near the town.
[316:03.19]I'll be in contact.
[316:06.77]Good.
[316:07.53]Artyom, let's go.
[316:09.23]Good luck, guys.
[316:13.96]I'm trying so hard not to.
[316:15.38]I don't know what I'm not supposed to laugh at.
[316:21.22]I look at the chat and I just see everyone laughing.
[316:22.88]It's gonna make me laugh.
[316:33.95]What did he say?
[316:36.65]I'm too busy trying not to laugh.
[316:38.59]Why am I not laughing?
[316:39.97]Who cares?
[316:40.66]There's no jokes here.
[316:43.97]What did he just say?
[316:44.77]I was not listening to him.
[316:52.10]What did he say?
[316:52.60]Go to the other controls.
[316:53.74]I can't do anything.
[316:54.88]What did he say?
[316:57.06]He said something.
[317:09.35]Oh my god.
[317:11.65]Give me the old camera.
[317:18.21]Oh, I'm in a bad spot.
[317:19.07]Hey, hey, hey, my jacket's caught.
[317:20.91]My jacket's caught in the door, dude.
[317:23.77]Oh, boy.
[317:24.39]I'm going to try not to laugh.
[317:53.58]Wait.
[317:54.78]This is the beginning.
[317:58.56]This is the very beginning of the game.
[318:07.63]I almost laughed right there at that wave.
[318:21.16]Okay.
[318:24.46]Boots like cadence.
[318:27.06]Yeah, we already did this.
[318:32.10]These aren't the guns that I had.
[318:37.04]These are not the guns I had.
[318:42.35]Uh, my immersion has been destroyed.
[318:43.71]I had a pistol last time.
[318:48.02]Okay, well, we're gonna have to just... Just use him, right?
[319:03.49]Why did I reload again?
[319:04.51]I don't have any bullets.
[319:09.61]Oh, what happened to my body?
[319:12.75]Oh, I remember this part.
[319:14.69]Yep.
[319:18.02]We've got to get to the top of the tower.
[319:19.30]We have to get to the top of the tower.
[319:20.82]We have to implant the chip so the Death Star cannot get the plans.
[319:24.72]I remember this.
[319:29.53]Once we get to the top of that tower, that weirdo guy is going to come and try to get us.
[319:32.61]There we go.
[319:41.26]Nice.
[319:46.04]Beginning is the end trope.
[319:47.16]I like it.
[319:51.41]This really is just Rogue One.
[320:02.88]I don't have any bullets left, man.
[320:04.16]I need to scavenge everybody.
[320:05.70]Anyone scavenging bullets here?
[320:10.45]No.
[320:17.70]Oh shit, I laughed It's all about the throwing knives that was in the head Oh
[320:46.04]Don't let him get me.
[321:02.79]Fucking game crashed.
[321:20.86]Oh, anticlimactic.
[321:25.59]We told you not to laugh.
[321:26.87]I can't help it.
[321:29.21]This game didn't crash like one time.
[321:31.55]And it hardlocked.
[321:37.31]My computer is hardlocked.
[321:38.67]I hope you guys enjoyed Metro 2033.
[321:43.19]I don't even have access to my computer.
[321:44.82]I have to turn my computer off.
[321:53.38]I'm serious.
[321:54.78]I'm serious.
[321:55.34]I'm hard-locked.
[322:01.51]Why is the computer hard-locked?
[322:04.47]Come on.
[322:05.45]Why?
[322:05.99]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[322:12.30]Control-Alt-Delete isn't doing anything.
[322:14.00]I don't have access to my task manager.
[322:16.66]God damn it.
[322:23.12]Give me a fucking break.
[322:24.04]How can we still hear you?
[322:28.02]I don't know.
[322:29.52]Because Metro has hard locked, I think it's like hard locked my GPU.
[322:34.52]I can still use my mouse, but I just can't do anything.
[322:39.46]I can open up the task manager, but no, here's what I have to do.
[322:43.35]I think I have to, no, that'll break everything.
[322:47.01]Okay, command prompt.
[322:49.71]Now, it's opening on my other monitor.
[322:51.47]I can't get it to open up on this screen.
[322:54.19]I'm going to have to turn off the other monitor.
[322:56.02]Hold on.
[322:59.94]Let's see what this does.
[323:02.66]Oh, no.
[323:03.54]No, no, that's not good.
[323:04.48]That's bad.
[323:05.66]That's very bad.
[323:08.10]I just moved the hard-locked computer screen to the other screen, and now I can't do anything.
[323:15.33]Oh, this is really, really bad.
[323:23.25]Oh shit.
[323:24.89]Hold on.
[323:26.09]I have to go into my display settings and make my second monitor my main monitor.
[323:30.93]No, that's not even going to work.
[323:31.71]I can't even get, I have, I can't do it.
[323:34.09]That's it.
[323:34.37]It's over.
[323:36.07]I have no access to this.
[323:37.01]I can't even see what you guys are saying.
[323:40.43]Hold on.
[323:46.29]Hover over the task manager.
[323:50.34]Oh my fucking lord, man.
[323:52.80]Wait, there we go.
[323:54.82]No, I can't.
[323:55.84]There it is.
[323:56.12]Metro.
[323:56.48]Metro.
[323:56.76]Metro.
[323:57.08]Okay.
[323:57.66]How do I end task?
[323:58.62]Is it space?
[323:59.76]Enter?
[324:01.26]Tab?
[324:02.78]Okay.
[324:03.08]Tab.
[324:03.42]End task.
[324:04.08]Space.
[324:04.46]Right?
[324:05.94]End task.
[324:07.36]Did I do it?
[324:08.86]Got it.
[324:10.10]Nice.
[324:12.24]That was lucky.
[324:14.73]That was very, very lucky.
[324:15.77]Let's do that again.
[324:17.99]I honestly thought the stream was going to be over right there.
[324:23.53]We're good.
[324:25.49]Everybody calm down.
[324:27.61]We're going to finish Metro right now.
[324:35.66]Launch it.
[324:37.28]Go from here.
[324:39.74]No, don't start in safe mode.
[324:41.48]No reason to.
[324:49.71]Knives have caused two crashes.
[324:51.43]Is that true?
[324:55.93]You've still got about five hours left.
[324:57.78]No, there's no more laughing for this game.
[325:00.84]Sorry.
[325:06.98]Continue.
[325:07.55]It should put us right where we were before.
[325:11.21]The last autosave.
[325:12.79]Chapter 7.
[325:13.49]I think I have to do the whole thing again.
[325:14.97]Nope.
[325:20.68]I got ten knives.
[325:26.18]I'm going to run out of bullets here, but it's alright.
[325:27.46]I'm going to take his gun.
[325:30.48]You missed.
[325:31.00]You fucking missed.
[325:31.66]Take a gun.
[325:32.06]Take the gun.
[325:32.44]Take his gun.
[325:32.86]Take this guy's gun.
[325:33.56]Take his gun.
[325:34.88]You can't take that gun.
[325:35.68]It doesn't exist.
[325:38.10]Oh, that's so dumb.
[325:39.36]Come on.
[325:39.60]There's no other weapon here.
[325:42.10]I really do have to.
[325:44.12]I actually do have to use knives and grenades.
[325:47.52]No, I don't.
[325:50.47]I don't.
[325:50.95]Okay.
[325:51.33]Just go back.
[326:00.30]Forget about the mask.
[326:01.65]You need weapons.
[326:17.07]Was that even the right ammo?
[326:18.91]Yeah, it was.
[326:19.25]Come on, come on, let's do it!
[326:23.31]Alright, we're good.
[326:24.53]Just make these shots count.
[326:26.87]These are funny bullets.
[326:46.47]We almost had a funny bullet.
[326:47.65]Yep.
[326:51.61]Alright, here we go.
[326:53.38]Move on out.
[326:53.76]I don't know what happened there.
[327:04.00]That guy just came in.
[327:04.76]That guy just appeared.
[327:05.50]But that's fine.
[327:07.58]Let's go.
[327:09.22]Why did you turn into a werewolf?
[327:10.20]That guy turned into a werewolf.
[327:11.26]No he didn't.
[327:12.16]I thought he turned into a werewolf.
[327:13.06]I thought that was like the big twist.
[327:18.87]What a waste.
[327:25.19]Come on, heal up.
[327:31.85]Take everything I need.
[327:32.73]Heal, heal, heal.
[327:37.19]And why is there no way to touch this?
[327:40.77]There's no way to touch that.
[327:42.66]Can't touch it.
[327:44.22]Just gotta move on.
[327:45.60]The game, we gotta move on.
[327:48.26]I can't grab it.
[327:55.93]Oh lord.
[327:57.63]What?
[327:57.85]Wait!
[327:58.08]That's the... Take a look at that for me.
[328:11.18]All over!
[328:31.75]Why did that happen?
[328:41.80]Okay, this looks like it was more sense to what was supposed to happen.
[328:48.13]Not guy appears next to me and kills me instantly.
[328:53.13]I didn't laugh, I scoffed.
[328:54.39]I went, scoffed.
[329:05.48]okay come on before before darth vader sees us hurry that's not a laugh I'd scoff is is a is an air coming out of your lungs to show a disappointment or to show anger not to think something's funny
[329:30.26]I want you to be tough.
[329:32.48]You're an eternal optimist, Miller.
[329:34.40]Easier said than done.
[329:39.77]What?
[329:40.01]Are you going to give me 10 fingers here?
[329:41.33]Is that what you're saying?
[329:42.91]OK.
[329:43.03]OK.
[329:43.27]I have an idea.
[329:44.63]Climb on top of the elevator.
[329:46.81]We will try to unlock the counterweight stopper.
[329:55.78]So we're gonna try to fling ourselves to the top.
[330:05.15]We're gonna ride the Tower of Terror here in a second.
[330:07.91]Yep.
[330:09.07]This is terrifying.
[330:13.99]We're gonna- our heads are gonna crush.
[330:19.38]I can't even look at the ceiling.
[330:20.32]This is making me seasick.
[330:24.50]Ugh.
[330:24.68]I'm gonna hit the ground.
[330:26.06]I'm gonna puke.
[330:32.60]That was that.
[330:33.84]I didn't laugh.
[330:36.34]What?
[330:36.96]Whoa.
[330:38.08]What the heck?
[330:39.63]Oh, I'm like scared.
[330:40.93]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[330:52.19]Alright then, Tim.
[330:53.13]Now we need a way to get you out of here.
[330:56.17]Demons!
[330:57.39]Demons.
[330:57.95]Hide!
[330:59.85]Oh, hide.
[331:02.76]Okay.
[331:04.20]Can you get in here?
[331:05.06]I don't think you can.
[331:06.20]I think I'm safe in here.
[331:07.66]I'm safe in here.
[331:11.66]Oh, there's no way to get out of here, though.
[331:13.10]I have to kill him.
[331:14.30]No, I don't.
[331:15.28]Dumbass.
[331:15.94]He's gone!
[331:17.28]Don't look into the way, I'm done!
[331:20.58]This looks like a correct way to go.
[331:34.66]Another gas mask.
[331:35.66]I have full gas mask.
[331:40.00]Shooting.
[331:40.40]I don't like this.
[331:42.68]What was that?
[331:47.34]Somebody tried to make a fire out of radios.
[331:52.20]Around still?
[331:52.92]On your back, watch out!
[331:56.72]I'm not even going to look behind me, dude.
[331:57.92]I'm sorry.
[331:59.20]I'm not going to get kicked off by a demon.
[332:03.96]Not going to happen.
[332:04.62]There's a staircase nearby.
[332:06.16]Go upstairs.
[332:07.79]Watch out.
[332:08.55]Oh, boy.
[332:09.05]Around, around.
[332:09.53]No, no, no, no, no.
[332:10.05]Through here.
[332:10.35]No, no, no, no, no.
[332:10.91]Down.
[332:12.31]Don't grab me.
[332:12.75]Don't grab me.
[332:14.59]Good.
[332:15.01]We're good.
[332:15.31]Come here, old man.
[332:17.79]I just landed some demons off.
[332:19.33]Still going up.
[332:29.51]Got him!
[332:32.19]This is just like in Time Crisis, when you have like five seconds to save the innocent person.
[332:37.58]We're good.
[332:51.65]No laughing, I didn't laugh.
[332:57.24]I would love to play Time Crisis on stream.
[332:58.92]Time Crisis 4 is a good one.
[333:00.42]Alright.
[333:01.12]Streamer lies?
[333:03.12]What are you talking about?
[333:24.03]Time Crisis 4 is... Time Crisis 3 and Time Crisis 4 are the best Time Crisis these.
[333:29.09]Time Crisis 5 is a disaster.
[333:31.29]That is an awful video game.
[333:34.05]That is a total disaster.
[333:38.41]This is not the right way.
[333:41.41]In Time Crisis 5, they introduced this weird... spam between left and right mode where you have to dive between corners.
[333:48.68]It's terrible.
[333:49.80]You just teleport from spot to spot.
[333:51.60]It's not fun.
[333:53.83]Do not recommend.
[333:56.59]Okay, so what am I... Can I just... Can I operate this now?
[333:58.87]Can I climb something?
[334:01.89]Can I snap the wire?
[334:04.17]There we go.
[334:15.14]It's a ladder.
[334:19.92]Ow.
[334:20.92]No.
[334:21.98]Press E.
[334:24.63]I'm alright.
[334:25.07]I'm gonna have to press E again.
[334:26.61]Just watch.
[334:28.77]E. Here comes E again.
[334:32.84]E. Alright.
[334:45.72]Keep going.
[334:47.02]We are almost at the top of the tower.
[334:50.16]What's the final showdown gonna be?
[334:52.74]Filters.
[334:53.17]Give you those.
[334:56.71]I'm going to say final showdown will be... I don't know.
[335:03.05]This game has been weird the whole time, so who knows.
[335:05.31]Yeah.
[335:26.21]So I'm going to have a choice to go side with the aliens or save Russia.
[335:32.37]And side with the humans, right?
[335:33.53]Is that where they're going with this?
[335:38.67]The opportunity is going to be... Go ahead.
[335:40.37]Side with the aliens.
[335:42.78]And use their alien technology to get rid of your...
[335:49.25]I was gonna say something really lewd right there, but I decided not to.
[335:52.48]A little bit of parkour at the end of the game.
[335:55.32]I like the platforming aspect.
[336:01.54]Do a little bit of reset there.
[336:02.66]It's alright.
[336:13.67]Wait.
[336:14.91]What happened?
[336:16.81]What did I just do?
[336:17.89]I gotta...
[336:19.76]We're fine.
[336:25.90]We're good.
[336:29.02]This is not the same way I just was.
[336:33.26]Now we're going the right way.
[336:34.20]Okay, make sure you parkour correctly.
[336:37.92]I can't use the flashlight in here.
[336:39.02]I'm gonna use a... How am I supposed to get over there?
[336:49.38]What?
[336:50.84]I'm confused.
[336:54.77]What happened?
[336:59.31]What's going on?
[337:03.55]Alright.
[337:04.67]E. Press E. Any more Es?
[337:12.77]A little ice in the way.
[337:13.61]I'm getting ready to press E. Prepping myself.
[337:21.21]I could use a heal.
[337:25.88]I guess not.
[337:26.40]Alright, this, that... I got a save point.
[337:32.96]That's good.
[337:38.87]No.
[337:41.07]Now I have to make a choice.
[337:50.66]Why am I not answering the radio?
[337:52.68]Let me at least check in.
[337:53.58]Alright, who's at the top of the tower?
[337:58.14]Who's at the top of the tower?
[337:59.22]Oh, it's me.
[338:04.23]I'm at the top of the tower.
[338:05.13]Alright.
[338:07.97]Let's set this thing up.
[338:16.96]Oh, this is to set up the bat signal.
[338:22.15]He's the only one that can save us.
[338:23.57]Who's going to stop me?
[338:26.19]I'm in like two different universes here.
[338:32.98]Man.
[339:02.65]You have to open up the box and see what's in it.
[339:07.21]In the volcano.
[339:08.57]Then the FOV is going to be times 5,000.
[339:11.96]Oh, boy.
[339:12.46]What does this even mean?
[339:13.12]What does this thing say?
[339:16.20]That's the wrong door.
[339:22.46]Let's see what the other doors are.
[339:24.70]How are you supposed to fall off?
[339:26.44]How do you fall off?
[339:27.32]How do you fall off when you're in a dreamland where they build shit around you?
[339:39.21]Whoever was in charge of putting the blocks under my feet, you're fired.
[339:48.79]Give me a break.
[339:50.87]I don't want to... Okay, that's the wrong way.
[339:53.55]Here we go.
[339:56.09]There's a correct way.
[339:57.07]I want to see what's in the other doors.
[340:00.17]Blocked.
[340:02.79]And... Alright, we got... I wanted to check the other doors.
[340:18.04]This is...
[340:29.40]I want to see what the other doors had.
[340:34.06]Now we're back in dreamland.
[340:40.69]We're going this way.
[340:41.67]I don't have any guns.
[340:42.51]We're just going to sprint.
[340:50.15]Bang a left.
[340:53.51]Oh, no.
[340:54.21]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[340:55.37]Should I run into him?
[340:57.78]Embrace the darkness?
[341:00.90]Sure.
[341:04.20]What are you gonna do?
[341:14.33]I laughed.
[341:14.91]Alright, I laughed.
[341:16.81]You gotta laugh at me.
[341:17.73]I lose the fake game we're playing.
[341:19.89]Alright, let's go in this door.
[341:21.85]No.
[341:23.78]I thought that was embrace the alien.
[341:25.54]We're gonna go.
[341:25.96]Here we go.
[341:26.34]This way.
[341:44.15]I thought there were two options.
[341:45.55]No.
[341:47.79]Everyone said I went in the wrong door.
[341:50.61]Sorry, guys.
[341:51.27]That wasn't the wrong door.
[341:53.59]I went in the right door.
[341:55.31]There's only one actual option.
[341:58.97]And... This is the correct door.
[342:08.81]Mm-hmm.
[342:09.63]Mm-hmm-hmm.
[342:15.45]I don't fall yet.
[342:17.59]Run away.
[342:22.16]You wake up.
[342:23.02]Turn around.
[342:23.54]Run away from the E.T.
[342:25.22]alien slender man person.
[342:27.82]Alright.
[342:35.94]Here he comes.
[342:37.31]Turn the corner.
[342:37.89]He flashes.
[342:40.03]I gotta pick up the seven or eight notes and then maybe I'll be able to get a chance to get off the island.
[342:46.25]Here he comes.
[342:46.89]It's me!
[342:47.67]Stop him!
[342:48.11]There we go.
[342:53.69]Run away.
[342:54.35]Run towards the light.
[342:56.17]Wait.
[342:56.47]I don't think it's this way.
[342:59.15]I see red.
[343:00.99]There's red over here.
[343:10.18]What?
[343:13.14]Touch the candle?
[343:21.11]No, here he comes now.
[343:25.61]This turned into a different game.
[343:35.52]I gotta make a choice.
[343:39.64]Who's on the left?
[343:40.22]Who's on the right?
[343:42.04]Who is that?
[344:07.60]I thought it was giving me like a choice and it's not there you just have to run towards the good people there is no choice it's just a game just play through it I'm trying so desperately to do the other thing that doesn't even matter there is no other thing to do there's only the one thing to do so go do it there he comes
[344:36.93]We're not going off script again.
[344:50.38]Now what?
[344:54.98]Alright, we made it.
[344:57.56]We're good to go.
[345:03.55]Back to reality.
[345:05.81]Nah, not quite.
[345:12.09]I have to make this jump You all thought I wasn't gonna make it I don't blame you I don't blame you for thinking that This is cool
[345:36.99]Two hallways.
[345:38.70]Ah, two hallways.
[345:39.90]We're gonna go this way.
[345:42.34]We're gonna go to the giant pair of lungs.
[345:46.88]Can I jump?
[345:47.48]Up that?
[345:47.80]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[345:51.75]Up the lungs.
[345:52.27]There's no other way to go.
[345:54.63]I gotta go back.
[346:01.87]Keep going.
[346:02.34]Come on.
[346:04.98]This is getting a little... Oh, they break.
[346:07.18]They break if you don't look at them for long enough.
[346:10.94]Oh, boy.
[346:13.31]Oh, dear.
[346:14.29]Oh, dear.
[346:16.35]Oh, dear.
[346:17.85]Which way is the alien?
[346:18.59]Not that way.
[346:19.47]Not going off script.
[346:33.60]Is this going to end...
[346:38.93]Oh no.
[346:43.32]Who is that?
[346:50.42]I don't know who that is.
[346:51.12]Am I supposed to know who that is?
[347:01.75]So do I shoot it?
[347:06.68]Should I shoot it?
[347:09.79]That's the same.
[347:13.28]Shoot it, shoot it, shoot it.
[347:14.62]I should kill it?
[347:15.18]I should shoot it?
[347:17.86]What if it's not hostile?
[347:23.28]Got it.
[347:24.22]He's not dead.
[347:33.66]How many times do I have to shoot the alien?
[347:40.44]Okay.
[347:42.22]Um.
[347:45.72]Did I win?
[347:46.20]Did I just shoot myself in the head?
[347:56.33]Is that what we're going with this?
[348:01.54]Why are my hands green?
[348:06.92]What do you mean the missiles?
[348:16.29]What happened?
[348:20.09]I turned into like a zombie.
[348:22.99]I have green skin now just like all the other aliens.
[348:35.38]So these are fireworks, right?
[348:36.31]This is the congratulations you beat the game.
[348:38.25]Here's your cool like Disney fireworks display.
[348:49.13]Well, there goes Nuketown.
[348:57.93]A wise man once said, he who leads a war for the love of his fellow men will defeat his enemies.
[349:05.26]Did I just nuke the whole city?
[349:07.00]Protecting my family and friends.
[349:09.66]Protecting my home.
[349:11.38]The metro.
[349:12.84]We had won.
[349:14.79]But to this day, I wonder, when we burned the dark ones from the face of the Earth, was something... Nuketown.
[349:29.96]Megaton.
[349:31.70]Nuketown is a terrible Call of Duty map.
[349:36.65]Oh, man.
[349:38.45]What a moron.
[349:44.35]Hey, there it is.
[349:45.43]The end of the game.
[349:50.93]Alright, you want my... You want to give it a rest?
[349:56.81]Or... Recommend to your friends.
[350:01.24]I'm going to recommend this one to my friends.
[350:05.34]I think it was... I think it was great.
[350:09.20]That was a great game.
[350:14.47]You want to talk about just playing a game and just, like, having a fun time in a game?
[350:17.19]Like, that was a great game.
[350:18.75]That was a good game.
[350:23.23]We gave it, like, a six and a half.
[350:29.06]I'm just kidding.
[350:31.10]No, that's good.
[350:32.08]That was fun.
[350:33.98]It was just long enough.
[350:34.76]It wasn't, like, too over-dragged out.
[350:36.80]All the areas were interesting.
[350:39.59]That library was terrifying and fun.
[350:45.64]The ending was a little, I think, dragged out.
[350:48.56]The climb of the tower was meh.
[350:54.38]I just beat Ranger mode on stream.
[350:55.86]Yeah, I did.
[350:59.83]So, we will play Last Light.
[351:01.77]I own Last Light already, so...
[351:05.20]We'll have some fun in that.
[351:06.62]Probably not tomorrow.
[351:07.88]We'll do something else tomorrow.
[351:09.12]Just to get away from Metro.
[351:10.03]Because we've done pretty much only Metro for like... Well, besides like the Christmas stream.
[351:14.73]It was Metro last stream too.
[351:17.83]But, yeah.
[351:19.87]Should I skip this or is there a secret ending?
[351:23.69]I guess there's no secret ending.
[351:29.26]No.
[351:30.82]Let me go over here.
[351:31.88]We're going to read the bits.
[351:34.06]That's going to be it for tonight.
[351:35.86]Almost six hours tonight so far at least.
[351:42.24]I get the bad ending.
[351:43.06]We skipped the secret ending.
[351:44.15]Whatever.
[351:44.53]Just go to YouTube if you want to go to the secret ending.
[351:50.13]But thank you everybody for watching.
[351:51.11]If you're just sticking around to watch Metro, I'll see you guys tomorrow night.
[351:54.21]Same time, same place.
[351:57.83]I recommend.
[351:59.85]Fun game.
[352:00.81]Hopefully the next one is as fun.
[352:03.55]So let's go back and get some of these bits.
[352:09.18]Let's see what we had here.
[352:10.68]Hey, bake me home thanks for the $1.
[352:18.72]How does it feel to be in Tim Allen's shoes?
[352:22.47]Having killed Sam.
[352:25.93]I'm not talking about that.
[352:28.23]I'm not going to read any bits that have anything to do with the big red guy.
[352:34.46]Because I'm going to be...
[352:38.74]I'm going on trial.
[352:40.46]I don't know what the court date is, but I have to stream the court date.
[352:46.06]I have to stream the trial.
[352:48.03]Because there were a lot of witnesses, apparently, to an apparent crime.
[352:58.82]And it isn't until proven guilty.
[353:02.48]That's how I like to say it.
[353:07.85]Whenever that's going to happen.
[353:09.61]There's a lot of people that were witnesses there.
[353:13.99]But thank you, nonetheless.
[353:17.11]Also, thank you to... Let's see what we got.
[353:26.34]Discord Lord, thank you for the $4.
[353:28.80]Much appreciated.
[353:30.52]Halbred, thanks for the $3.
[353:31.44]Hey, Jeremiah, I've been watching you for almost four years and I really enjoy your streams.
[353:35.28]Well, thank you, Halbred.
[353:37.37]Thank you for the $3 also.
[353:39.47]Smokey, thanks for the $1.
[353:40.59]Hey, Jerma, how much do I have to pay you to get to make an announcement?
[353:43.59]Oh, that's the poop guy.
[353:44.98]Smokey, that's the say poop on your Steam group.
[353:49.84]No.
[353:52.30]Maybe I will randomly one day.
[353:53.94]That'd be fun.
[353:57.91]Thank you, Kilganon, for the $1.
[353:59.51]Jerma is streaming from a secret underground bunker through 12 VPNs.
[354:03.39]He doesn't want us to know he's on...
[354:07.03]The lamb and avoiding trial.
[354:09.61]I'm not avoiding trial.
[354:11.79]I already told you.
[354:13.03]I'm going to get the court date.
[354:13.85]I'm going to get summoned.
[354:15.67]And it has to be live streamed.
[354:17.37]Because it's going to be on CNA CNBC or something.
[354:21.46]Whatever it is.
[354:22.88]Like CNA CNN NBC.
[354:26.22]CNNJ NBC.
[354:27.50]It's not going to be on regular TV.
[354:30.06]It's going to be on CNNJ CNNBC.
[354:33.42]But thank you.
[354:34.80]Thank you to Problematic Mint for the $10.
[354:36.64]Appreciate it.
[354:39.69]Kingelberg, thanks for the $10.
[354:42.33]I believe in y'all, Jermo.
[354:45.13]Thank you.
[354:48.27]Thank God this stream is over.
[354:51.17]Thank you for watching.
[354:54.85]RedTuna, thanks for the $1.50.
[354:57.21]Is this a streamer who saved Paul Simon in the line?
[355:02.85]Tato, thank you, Tato Seal, for the bits.

[355:12.95]Thank you so much.
[355:13.99]Renegade, thanks for the 25 cents.
[355:15.25]Hi, Jerma.
[355:15.61]This is my first cheer on Twitch ever.
[355:17.77]I got this from an ad.
[355:21.11]It's very humbling to know that somebody is, like I said before,
[355:24.42]willing to watch ads over and over again to give me money on a streaming platform.
[355:29.54]Thank you.
[355:32.18]Akil Gannon again, thanks for the $1.
[355:34.39]Jeremy has attempted to stifle my messages by ignoring my previous donation, but I have intel on his location and have notified the authorities.
[355:41.75]Mr. Claus.
[355:44.59]It's like you're talking about a guy with big claws on his hands.
[355:48.62]You're talking about Wolverine.
[355:51.53]Yeah, Wolverine is going to be avenged in the new Marvel Universe.
[355:57.32]Stop fucking saying this before you get me in a lot of fucking trouble.
[356:03.62]Stop saying those things.
[356:06.00]Wolverine claws.
[356:13.07]Thank you, though.
[356:13.47]Thank you to War God for the bits.
[356:14.85]Jeremy, I love you like family.
[356:17.49]You need to duck.

[356:54.32]Thank you for bringing my brother and me closer together.
[356:57.34]Holiday cheer.
[356:59.14]Darkstar, thank you so much for the $3.
[357:05.06]I'm glad that you guys can watch these streams and videos and at least get some enjoyment from them.
[357:12.88]Any way I can help you and your brother connect, obviously that's great.
[357:16.41]It means a lot.
[357:18.50]Thank you so much.
[357:21.56]Vam Evan, thanks for the 215.
[357:23.34]You beat it.
[357:24.26]I did.
[357:25.06]I did beat this game.
[357:26.92]On Ranger.
[357:28.76]Which, it's not that big of a deal, but you know.
[357:31.82]It's kind of, it's alright.
[357:35.00]Deathlinger, thank you for the $1.
[357:36.94]Save up for the Kalesh 2012.
[357:38.66]It's one of the best weapons in the game.
[357:41.48]Well, I eventually got it for free.
[357:44.56]But, yeah, it was a good weapon.
[357:47.98]ProSef, ProStar, thanks for the $1.
[357:49.64]You think you're ever going to do Intruder again?
[357:51.26]Best stream I've ever seen.
[357:52.36]I feel like Intruder was fun, but unless I want to take it seriously and play the game for real, kind of did all the roleplay-y, jokey shit.
[358:05.13]I feel like just doing it again would kind of be doing the same thing again.
[358:08.44]I'd rather try to move on to something else.
[358:10.73]It's a really, really cool game, though.
[358:11.81]That game's really interesting.
[358:13.29]It's kind of like Rainbow Six Siege, but fun and funny.
[358:16.99]Hold on.
[358:18.39]I did just make it like... I just insulted Rainbow Six Siege.
[358:21.70]And I absolutely meant to do that.
[358:23.64]So I just want to make sure you're very clear about that, that that was what I meant to do.
[358:28.60]So thank you to Harmony Accord.
[358:30.36]And we got $50 just came in.
[358:34.62]We're going to get that in a second.
[358:36.18]Not very many more to go.
[358:39.37]Harmony Accord, thank you for the $5.
[358:41.81]It's been a few months now, but I just wanted to inform you I found out who has been sending me all of that horse pudding.
[358:48.36]I apologize for accusing you.
[358:49.84]On an off-topic and separate note, do you need any horse pudding sent to you?
[358:54.34]No, I don't want anyone sending me shit anymore.
[358:58.16]No?
[358:59.02]Don't send me things anymore, please.
[359:02.37]You have to be good at it.
[359:03.51]Wink.
[359:06.22]If you like Siege, I'm glad you like it.
[359:11.43]For me, in my opinion, remember, we're talking about red alert.
[359:14.03]Red alert.
[359:14.71]Here you go.
[359:16.47]Ready?
[359:17.78]Make sure you guys are aware of this.
[359:22.58]Okay.
[359:23.00]Hold on.
[359:25.88]I got to make sure I do this.
[359:27.01]This is really important.
[359:35.32]Just give me a second.
[359:38.04]I'm going to change the color.
[359:38.94]OK.
[359:50.29]Let's go here.
[359:51.25]Alright.
[359:54.62]Let's go.
[359:54.96]OK, here we go.
[359:58.27]So, I do have a couple things to say about Rainbow Six Siege.
[360:05.01]And that's, first of all, I think that it's every single awful thing that was in Call of Duty and CSGO.
[360:13.19]It's just people sit still the video game.
[360:16.03]And whoever, like, pokes their head out first dies, loses.
[360:19.39]You win the game.
[360:19.91]It's just everybody sits in a corner.
[360:21.42]The video game.
[360:28.27]Uh, this is, thank you, this has been a, this has been a personal opinion.
[360:34.43]And there we go, that's it.
[360:41.93]Maybe in copper rank.
[360:47.20]No, that was a lot, I look, I look, I look, listen, listen, listen, listen.
[360:56.25]I know there's a lot of strategy, okay?
[360:59.33]I'm very, very aware of that.
[361:01.87]But sometimes you just want to play a game.
[361:04.71]What is going on?
[361:05.90]Why am I getting a credit card commercial?
[361:08.44]What is this?
[361:08.86]Alright.
[361:11.26]But sometimes...
[361:19.98]Alright, it auto-played another video.
[361:22.20]Anyways, I know that Siege is a super, super strategy game.
[361:29.29]You sit in a corner, and you wait for the attackers to show their head, and they're dead, and you board up the windows, you board up the walls, and oh boy, he's going too far.
[361:42.54]He's going too far.
[361:43.62]He said something about my favorite video game.
[361:46.12]I'm not sure I like this guy anymore.
[361:49.47]How dare he say that?
[361:51.05]He doesn't even understand what it takes to sit in that corner and to communicate with my teammates and use the sledgehammer!
[362:02.75]Um... No.
[362:05.67]We'll get off this joke.
[362:07.40]Let me just tell you, everybody has their own likes and dislikes in video games.
[362:12.96]I've seen people play Siege, and I've seen them play it really well, and it's actually really intense and a really fun watch.
[362:23.60]It's just not for me.
[362:26.66]Anyway.
[362:29.74]Thank you, too.
[362:31.68]I don't know how we got there.
[362:34.54]We did, though.
[362:35.35]Somehow.
[362:36.61]And Adam, thank you for the $1.
[362:37.91]Rat Movie 3 is an upcoming action-adventure video game being developed by Jerma985 and published by Electronic Arts.
[362:43.21]Not true.
[362:44.31]It is the second video game to be directed by Germany after Life is Pain.
[362:48.10]I hate
[362:49.92]Announced at E3 2017, the game will only be able to be played in either online or local co-op between two players with no single player mode.
[362:59.04]What is this?
[362:59.54]This game is currently scheduled for release on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows for early 2049.
[363:04.44]Is this a fake Wikipedia article or what?
[363:13.35]Thank you.
[363:16.79]Also, thank you to Grim Fandango.
[363:19.27]That's an old one.
[363:19.95]That's an old video game.
[363:21.42]Thanks for the $5, dude.
[363:23.50]Jeremy, my friend wants you to be the godfather of her child.
[363:26.94]Yes, no.
[363:29.64]I'm going to say no because that means there's responsibilities there.
[363:35.10]I'm sorry.
[363:35.66]I can't be responsible for that child.
[363:38.38]I wish her the best of luck, though.
[363:42.26]It's very, very, thank you so much for even considering me as the godfather for that baby.
[363:49.70]Please respond.
[363:50.88]Deathlinger, thanks for the $1.
[363:54.58]Bad joke.
[363:55.40]We got plenty of those.
[363:57.09]Smokey, thanks for the $1.
[363:58.17]We're not fucking around.
[363:59.01]Turn the stream off.
[364:00.55]BabyRage.
[364:01.17]Oh, that's when I was being a baby and I was telling everybody to tell me how funny I was.
[364:06.94]Death linger, thanks for the bits.
[364:08.16]Bad meme.
[364:08.93]I don't know what it was, but I'm sure it was.
[364:10.71]Kill Ganon again, thanks for the bits.
[364:11.91]The Earth is a trapezoidal prism.
[364:13.63]Wake up, sheeple.
[364:17.55]I've never seen the Earth from space.
[364:20.83]I don't know what it looks like.
[364:24.34]It might be shaped like Texas.
[364:27.32]That's where they got the idea for what Texas looked like.
[364:30.04]Because they wanted to make it look like the Earth.
[364:37.74]Thank you, JB4IL3Y for the 10 bucks.
[364:42.22]It was my birthday yesterday.
[364:44.14]Can you please call me a... Oh, boy, oh, boy.

[365:59.54]I did.
[365:59.84]I didn't say anything.
[366:05.08]I didn't say anything.
[366:07.06]I talked about going around the country.

[367:12.67]I really do.
[367:13.27]I think it's my PSVR.

[368:49.79]Everybody uses that face.
[368:51.27]I see that face everywhere.
[368:52.59]I will never remove myself from seeing that face.
[368:56.27]I close my eyes and I see that face.
[369:00.21]When did he ask for this?
[369:01.03]At the very beginning of the stream.
[369:02.79]I didn't even get to finish what I was going to say.
[369:07.49]There was a thought there, and the thought just kind of floated into the air.
[369:14.57]What, your face?
[369:15.43]Yeah, my face.
[369:16.11]I see my face when I close my eyes.

[369:49.77]B-Day 100.
[369:50.85]Guys, in Jerma, I guess I just passed my Alex math exam.
[369:55.96]This allows me to skip five semesters of math classes and go straight to my double major in computer science.
[370:02.62]I'm so happy.
[370:03.44]You're so happy.
[370:04.84]You are a smart person.
[370:07.68]You are a smart man.
[370:10.90]Or a smart woman.
[370:11.64]I'm not sure.
[370:15.82]That's awesome.
[370:17.84]Congratulations.
[370:21.36]Hopefully you go on to do, you know, take a look at some blockchain jobs.
[370:26.68]That's what I'm telling you.
[370:27.46]Graduate computer science, get on that blockchain.
[370:33.09]That's the big up and coming thing.
[370:35.39]2018, 2019, companies are looking for blockchain.
[370:37.51]Telling you.
[370:42.45]But thank you though.
[370:43.47]Congratulations.
[370:45.48]Also, thank you to Aeroless.
[370:47.46]Aeroless double zero zero.
[370:49.18]Aeroless double zero single zero three zero.
[370:51.30]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[370:54.28]Thank you for giving Metro a chance.
[370:55.56]It's one of my favorite games and it's been a blast watching you play it.
[370:59.00]Very impressed by how quickly you made it through the library on Ranger mode.
[371:02.58]Keep up the great streams.
[371:04.69]jermaGlue.
[371:06.91]That was the best part of the whole game.
[371:08.11]That was terrifying and difficult and weird and that was a great part of the game.
[371:13.73]Thank you so much for the $10 though, dude.
[371:16.79]Also, Zaza, thank you, Zaza, or Sasa Salt for the $1.
[371:23.07]Hey, Jerma, I just watched an old video where you beatboxed the Meet the Medic theme.
[371:30.33]Do you still do that?
[371:32.27]I'm too old.
[371:34.51]I lost the mouth ability.
[371:38.79]Maybe one day.
[371:41.06]Thank you, Zaza, for the $1.
[371:44.34]And then Asha108, Asha108, a few minutes ago, like 10 minutes ago, gave 50 bucks, $50, and said, suck.
[371:56.99]Suck.
[371:59.79]Thank you for the 50 bucks, Asha.
[372:04.59]I don't know, is it Asha?
[372:06.35]Asha?
[372:06.71]I see Asha.
[372:07.97]I see Asha.
[372:09.79]I did the Mario theme a month ago.
[372:13.36]Well, sometimes you get old.
[372:14.96]And one month is a long time when you get over 30 years old.
[372:18.18]It's like it turns into dog years.
[372:20.80]Each month is like six months when you go post-30.
[372:23.61]I'm telling you.
[372:25.83]But thank you so much, Asha, for the $50.
[372:27.27]It's incredibly generous of you.
[372:29.01]Thank you so much.
[372:30.93]That's a lot of money.
[372:34.32]Devlin2Million, thank you for the $1.
[372:36.50]Jerma, in my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave a piece of advice I've been turning over in my head ever since.
[372:42.12]He said, subscribe to Jerma985.
[372:43.88]That guy is funny as all hell and makes my day brighter every time I hear his angelic voice.
[372:51.72]Oh, thank you.
[372:53.88]Thank you, Devlin.
[372:55.02]Devlin.
[372:55.70]Devlin.
[372:57.76]OneEyedNinja, thanks again for the $1.
[373:05.03]Hi, Jerma.
[373:05.41]I'd just like to say thank you so much for making me laugh even in hard times.
[373:08.28]When I'm feeling down, you always make me laugh.
[373:10.84]Well, one-eyed.
[373:12.58]Thank you.
[373:14.24]Thank you so much for the $1.
[373:17.36]Much love.
[373:19.80]Appreciate it.
[373:21.74]Very much so.
[373:22.80]Zaza again gave 25 cents.
[373:24.62]Unprofessional streamer.
[373:26.99]I'm very unprofessional.
[373:29.19]I would be that guy that would... Look, I would be that guy that goes to work
[373:35.60]And doesn't wear the dress code.
[373:39.22]I'd be very unprofessional.
[373:40.42]I'm the guy that goes to work with just a button up, no tie.
[373:46.18]And the boss calls me in and he's like, where's your tie?
[373:47.97]I was like, I don't wear ties.
[373:51.97]He's like, okay, well then come in with a tie on tomorrow or we'll find somebody else for the position.
[373:59.13]And I go home and I really think about it.
[374:00.44]And I wake up in the morning and I get on my shirt.
[374:02.96]It's nicely, freshly ironed.
[374:05.69]And I see the tie.
[374:07.10]I'm running a little late.
[374:08.46]I don't have time to put the tie on.
[374:10.56]So I leave the tie and go to work again with a buttoned up shirt, no tie.
[374:17.00]Go to the office.
[374:17.74]I sit down and my boss walks by and notices that I'm not wearing the tie.
[374:23.18]Pulls me into his office.
[374:24.94]Closes the door behind him and says, where's your tie?
[374:29.55]And I say, boss, I was running a little late.
[374:31.59]I don't have a tie.
[374:33.91]And he fires me.
[374:35.60]And that's what happened exactly seven years ago when I lost my job.
[374:39.08]And that's when I started making YouTube videos.
[374:46.58]I worked for a financial investment company seven, eight years ago.
[374:53.22]And I got fired.
[374:53.88]They let me go.
[374:54.84]And that's what happens when you don't wear a tie.
[375:00.72]I managed people's stocks and bonds and stuff.
[375:04.99]I was really good at what I did.
[375:14.10]Fucking really smart, too.
[375:17.40]That was a $285,000 a year job.
[375:18.12]It was fucking easy to me.
[375:19.12]Didn't want to wear a tie.
[375:20.00]Thank you so much to Art of... Art of...
[375:33.58]What should I invest in?
[375:36.43]I'm not going to give investment advice.
[375:44.51]You can't give investment advice.
[375:45.91]Sorry.
[375:46.39]That's not how it works.
[375:47.09]I'm not your financial advisor.
[375:51.77]Thank you to Artificer for the two bucks.
[375:56.53]Cheer.
[375:57.69]I didn't know how to add notes to bits, but if I did on my last one, it would have been hilarious.
[376:01.67]Let me tell you.
[376:04.20]Well, let's just pretend it was really funny.
[376:06.50]Dubskidoo, thanks for the $1.
[376:07.71]You never lived down the Jerm of fear emote because it was glue man ending your whole wrestling career.
[376:11.97]That's true.
[376:15.69]Thank you, Pin, for the $1.
[376:17.67]You sucks, LOL.
[376:21.64]That is a classic.
[376:23.14]That is a classic.
[376:25.02]I love it.
[376:26.80]Asha, again, thank you for the $5 total.
[376:30.25]The last donation was a joke, but for real, I want to say how much I appreciate everything you, the mods, Kim, Etalyx have done for the stream.
[376:38.51]Even though I've missed a lot of streams, I feel like it's been for good because now I have a new job and a new job I love and a lady I love.
[376:48.03]You're a great guy, and honestly, I love how successful you've become after years of hard work.
[376:51.96]You're an inspiration to me and many others in this chat.
[376:54.48]Happy New Year, and here's to another year of memes, dreams, and rams.
[377:01.06]No, I'm bad at rhyming.
[377:05.99]I said it wrong.
[377:06.87]That would have been kind of funny if I wasn't an idiot.
[377:10.43]But thank you so much, Asho108.
[377:11.59]I feel like we all fuck around in here.
[377:19.48]I know that most of the time we're just messing around.
[377:23.78]But, you know, you guys are all awesome.
[377:27.32]I feel like we give and take.
[377:29.37]We fuck around with each other all the time.
[377:31.21]People make fun of me.
[377:32.05]They don't actually mean it, you know?
[377:35.01]Like, everybody makes fun of me in the chat, and I don't think that I don't actually mean it.
[377:37.89]It's just a joke.
[377:38.79]It's all just jokes.
[377:40.43]And when I say, like, shit, like, fuck the whole chat, it's just a joke.
[377:44.49]We're just, like, messing around.
[377:45.62]We're just having, you know, back and forth.
[377:46.98]Just like, you know, like, I knocked you on the shoulder, like buddies.
[377:56.98]I'm just kidding.
[377:59.70]It's all jokes.
[378:01.70]You guys are all awesome.
[378:03.10]I love you all.
[378:04.92]And that's going to end the stream.
[378:07.25]How dare you?
[378:08.27]No, it was a joke.
[378:09.05]It was a pretend.
[378:35.88]It's just a joke.
[378:37.54]It's gonna be alright.
[378:45.86]Caution.
[378:47.06]A virus has been detected.
[378:55.81]What?
[378:56.65]What do you mean?
[378:58.23]Where?
[378:59.43]Am I a virus?
[379:01.51]What?
[379:05.58]Whatever.
[379:07.56]That's so dumb.
[379:08.97]Good night, everybody.
[379:09.63]See you guys tomorrow.
[379:13.49]We'll play something interesting.
[379:14.71]We'll do something cool.
[379:16.19]Oh, shit.
[379:16.55]I gotta run malware bytes.
[379:19.61]Take care, everybody.
[379:20.47]See you later.
[379:55.97]you
[380:30.85]you
