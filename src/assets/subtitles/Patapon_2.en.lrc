[00:00.49]Hello.
[00:00.87]Hold on.
[00:58.69]And I had to tweet too.
[00:59.51]I had to tweet that out.
[01:03.01]And we're playing Patapon.
[01:05.91]Hello, good afternoon.
[01:08.55]How's your day going?
[01:09.23]Is it going good?
[01:12.18]Good.
[01:14.96]He's a social media mogul.
[01:18.68]Can't wait for social media tycoon.
[01:22.46]Started zero likes.
[01:24.71]And you get up to 500,000 followers?
[01:30.77]Does that exist?
[01:32.62]Does that game exist?
[01:36.48]It probably does.
[01:42.09]But yeah, I'm going to play Patapon 2 actually, not just Patapon.
[01:45.88]Patapon 2.
[01:46.40]In the pre-stream chat, we had a little bit of a vote.
[01:51.88]And I've been told that Patapon 2 is just a better version of Patapon 1 in almost every way.
[02:04.19]It's just one but better.
[02:05.27]That's what I've been told, and that's what we're going to do because we can always go back and do the prequel.
[02:12.82]I'm going to give it a shot.
[02:13.86]We'll see how it goes.
[02:14.56]We'll play for a while, see if I like it.
[02:21.80]New game?
[02:22.28]Yeah, we did Gacha Force.
[02:24.05]Gacha Force is done.
[02:27.17]I loved every second of it.
[02:28.27]Patapon 3, Waiting Room.
[02:36.42]I heard Patapon 3 is not very good.
[02:39.40]Didn't people say Patapon 3 is the not good one?
[02:47.41]It's too grindy.
[02:52.11]Who made this?
[02:53.89]I saw a Japan studio pop up.
[02:57.64]What company actually made this?
[03:05.78]Bungie.
[03:06.58]I don't know.
[03:09.12]Bungie didn't make this.
[03:10.47]Oh, Pyramid did.
[03:12.11]Pyramid Studios.
[03:18.79]Bungie.
[03:23.51]They need to make a new Patapon.
[03:24.65]Am I gonna love this game?
[03:26.47]We're about to find out.
[03:27.83]Like, right now.
[03:33.01]Am I gonna love this game?
[03:33.95]Oh, you gotta place your bets.
[03:49.71]Not much time has gone by and I already like it.
[03:51.49]Alright, so let's do a... A new game?
[04:02.83]How can I continue nothing?
[04:05.90]I'm ready, let's go.
[04:11.12]As the ship neared completion, Hatapon suddenly remembered an old story.
[04:19.15]Oh, mighty leader, let's sail off into the dark unknown as our search for earthen... I didn't get to read it.
[04:27.08]The Patapons bravely set off on their voyage, leaving behind their loved ones, friends, and the safety of their home island.
[04:32.15]They braved many violent storms and sweated through many scorching days.
[04:36.11]It was indeed a long and arduous voyage, but the brave Patapons refused to give up.
[04:40.78]This is Patapon 1.
[04:43.41]However, all their suffering was insignificant compared to the trouble they had.
[04:46.69]Only after 49 days and 49 nights, the Patapons truly learned of the evils that lurked below the depths of the sea.
[04:53.83]Their fate unknown.
[04:54.55]What will become of the Patapons now?
[04:56.41]We got the whole story from Patapon 1.
[05:03.93]Patapon Oath.
[05:05.69]I gotta take this.
[05:06.23]I... Hold on.
[05:11.90]I hereby pledge to honor and keep my promise to be the great leader of the Patapons and help them reach Earthend.
[05:19.36]I will not stray from my goal, even in the face of death or great peril.
[05:23.84]Even at moments of weakness, I will keep the beat and feel the rhythm of the Earth.
[05:29.11]From this point forward, I promise to keep my pledge and take this drum of courage and be the mighty leader I was meant to be.
[05:36.61]This is my oath.
[05:41.58]Won't you tell us your name, almighty one?
[05:44.92]Rants from Pat upon save data.
[05:50.67]Tell us your name.
[06:15.66]What?
[06:17.10]Okay, well.
[06:19.24]Okay, you can only do four letters.
[06:26.10]Welcome to the world of Patapon.
[06:29.07]Oh, great one.
[06:29.55]If this is your first time playing, might we recommend you start off in the easy mode?
[06:32.93]Oh, no.
[06:33.61]What do I do?
[06:38.75]Do I say no?
[06:39.57]Okay, how hard is Patapon?
[06:42.23]Is this a hard game?
[06:48.00]No.
[06:48.36]Say yes.
[06:50.38]Yes.
[06:52.22]Pepe laughed.
[06:52.82]It's extremely hard.
[06:55.34]Hardest game.
[06:55.94]Yes, it's hard.
[06:58.12]Okay, can I change the difficulty whenever I want?
[07:06.22]No.
[07:09.16]I can't change the difficulty.
[07:16.66]Hey!
[07:23.58]This is a kid's game.
[07:29.36]Every game is a kid's game, apparently.
[07:30.82]Oh, it's a rhythm game.
[07:36.55]Name me a game that's not a kid's game.
[07:38.77]I just got freaked out because I was like, why does it know my name?
[07:42.89]I just put it in.
[07:43.95]Earthen turned out to be unreachable.
[07:45.21]The Patapon's long voyage ended as the ship sank to the bottom of the ocean.
[07:48.03]I told you.
[07:51.65]Okay.
[07:51.93]Boom boom boom boom!
[08:21.07]That was cute.
[08:22.17]You got it.
[08:22.61]There are four drum beats in one measure.
[08:25.13]If you keep to the beat for four counts, one measure, you'll perform a command.
[08:28.63]Give it a try.
[08:30.03]Hit pawn four times in a row to save the princess.
[08:35.62]Is this like a turn-based RPG?
[08:41.30]Listen to that drum.
[08:42.06]I feel it returning our power.
[08:44.98]What could it be, our mighty leader?
[08:49.38]Oh, benevolent one, I always knew you would come for us.
[08:51.44]That's why I protected the drum at all costs.
[08:53.16]Please take the drum.
[08:57.28]I'll take it.
[08:59.02]How many drums do I get?
[09:00.06]We're going to learn about the next one.
[09:03.81]Okay, that's pun.
[09:09.89]Hatter.
[09:12.93]Cool.
[09:13.35]How much battery do I have in this controller?
[09:18.32]Oh no, we'll find out.
[09:18.94]Let's practice.
[09:20.22]Next.
[09:20.42]Easy there, mighty leader.
[09:21.56]Chillax and feel the rhythm.
[09:46.69]If you match the four beats pro- Wait, I didn't do it?
[09:51.36]Please don't beat the- Wait, what?
[09:52.50]Pataphons will march for four beats.
[09:56.68]When they stop, you gotta start drumming.
[09:58.26]Oh, I haven't done it?
[10:15.70]Okay.
[10:17.95]Okay.
[10:18.51]I'm gonna fuck this all up, aren't I?
[10:20.69]They're gonna get so hard.
[10:21.95]You're ready!
[10:47.02]I feel like I have Pringles candy.
[10:52.52]Anybody want to invite me to their band?
[10:57.51]I'm pretty good at the Pringles.
[11:00.01]I can't read the... You can read it.
[11:22.82]Wait, we have to fight?
[11:25.99]Do I just sit back here and just make noise?
[11:59.70]attack I did it so you just have to keep the beat that's gonna end up being like square circle triangle triangle triangle circle square square x and I'm gonna the whole thing up enough to quit the game third time four minutes touching zero spoils none
[12:30.83]This seems kind of cool.
[12:31.79]Hatapon's march.
[12:34.05]It's easy to look at the Hatapon's location.
[12:35.37]He's always dead center.
[12:36.63]I thought it was the same position.
[12:37.35]He's always dead.
[12:38.07]Okay.
[12:40.49]During the Pata Pata march, Hatapon will march along with the rest of the army.
[12:44.03]During the Pon Pon attack chant, he'll bravely maintain his position.
[12:51.02]Uh, alright.
[12:51.66]A mysterious race that hide their face behind masks.
[12:54.72]Medan came upon them when she went wandering on an unknown.
[13:00.29]She took Hatapon and the others to the place she had stumbled upon.
[13:02.63]They arrived at the end of the night in the ruins of Patapon's village, Patopolis.
[13:12.23]I gotta turn this up on my end.
[13:14.52]Almighty Jeremy, thank you for helping me out of that disaster.
[13:19.14]You're welcome.
[13:20.82]Hold on.
[13:22.32]Let's audio up.
[13:26.27]I need to be able to hear the beat.
[13:28.89]Yeah, you're welcome.
[13:29.89]Great to see you again.
[13:30.61]I'm the priestess of the Great Patapon.
[13:32.51]My name is Miden.
[13:34.45]The return celebration is about to start, but first please follow me.
[13:40.86]This stone obelisk is the pride of the Patapon tribe.
[13:43.42]It shows that our ancestors once thrived in this area.
[13:46.78]If we want to reach Earthen, we have to retake the form of Patopolis.
[13:52.92]We'll talk more later.
[13:53.68]Right now, please head through the obelisk to go hunting for some meat to fill our stomachs.
[14:03.00]What?
[14:05.73]I can, like, move around?
[14:06.97]Look.
[14:08.49]I should save.
[14:08.97]Okay.
[14:11.75]Cool.
[14:12.15]Let's go.
[14:15.59]Alright.
[14:15.83]Let's do it.
[14:29.97]Headquarters.
[14:32.50]These are the troops.
[14:34.56]HP 120, crit ratio 15%.
[14:38.28]Damage 4 to 12, attack speed 2, resist, ignite.
[14:41.98]Alright, what if they equip?
[14:46.12]Wooden helm, wooden spear.
[14:48.70]Do they have it on?
[14:51.60]Wooden helm.
[14:53.24]Standard issue helmet.
[15:01.37]Alright, should I give somebody hair?
[15:02.70]What's the hair do?
[15:04.10]Alright, let's do it.
[15:05.96]I love that there's an optimize button.
[15:07.66]Look at that stat difference.
[15:30.95]Is there a bad stat difference?
[15:33.23]Wait, how do I... Okay, quick.
[15:34.89]Lordly Hairpiece.
[15:38.91]There's no... The only stat difference... I see, like, a bunch of buffs or something?
[15:42.48]What's on the bottom?
[15:44.26]Just hit Optimize.
[15:45.94]Optimize the squad.
[15:48.10]Takes it off.
[15:49.60]That's resistance.
[15:50.46]I want you to wear this.
[15:51.96]Somebody can wear it.
[15:52.48]Whatever.
[15:52.78]Alright, let's go.
[16:00.07]Let's rest up.
[16:00.73]We've got a big day.
[16:06.39]Lordly Hairpiece gives immunity to all statuses.
[16:08.17]That's cool.
[16:10.53]Alright, are we ready?
[16:11.03]Make the Pataphons the courage to fight.
[16:13.94]Bang!
[16:19.00]Bang!
[16:31.68]That's amazing.
[16:35.83]That's the way.
[16:36.55]What was it?
[16:41.43]What was it?
[16:43.79]What was it?
[16:44.37]What was it?
[16:48.12]Wait, hold on.
[16:48.80]Tell me to forward march.
[16:50.46]I just got struck by lightning.
[16:52.32]Okay.

[17:40.39]Again!
[17:41.49]It hit its dead body.
[18:10.12]There's too much going on.
[18:11.08]How much meat do we need?
[18:17.72]Shit.
[18:19.14]Wasn't a- Oh no, we're good.

[18:45.59]ruined go go go go go go go go go go go go go go I got three teeth
[19:14.37]I'm going to be really bad at this game.
[19:15.37]I just want to make that really clear to everybody.
[19:17.35]There's going to be like five combinations eventually, and it's going to be too much for me.
[19:21.39]It's going to get locked up and confused in my brain, and I'm going to rage put the game to about 45 minutes.
[19:28.72]I'm glad we're seeing the credits right now.
[19:40.76]There are only four combos.
[19:41.98]I'm just kidding.
[19:49.21]Oh, great Jerry, thank you for this food that you've blessed us with.
[19:52.57]Yum.
[19:54.53]Look how our people have come home.
[19:55.63]We're all excited over the great Jerry's return.
[19:57.85]Hooray for Jerry.
[20:00.31]Hooray for the great Patapon.
[20:02.51]Everyone, give your thanks to Jerry the Benevolent.
[20:05.30]His Grace has made all these blessings possible.
[20:09.38]Great Jerry, please allow me to show the way to our altar.

[20:46.77]Pata-pata-pata-pon.
[20:47.95]Attack.
[20:49.31]Pon-pon-pata-pon, right?
[20:53.19]Legendary memory.
[20:54.41]This great warrior once fought a thousand foes.
[20:56.78]Meat.
[20:58.34]Cafeteria meat.
[20:59.26]Okay.
[21:03.32]Wait, there's a crafting system?
[21:05.38]A magnificent warped fang.
[21:08.05]Shaved down to use as a weapon.
[21:11.03]Huh.
[21:12.45]Oh, alright.
[21:12.73]Alright.
[21:16.57]Do I eat this?
[21:19.77]Oh.
[21:24.33]Use it later for materials.
[21:25.55]Oh, okay.
[21:29.92]It's used for upgrades.
[21:30.76]Oh, alright.
[21:31.48]That's cool.
[21:33.66]Can I do anything else?
[21:34.98]Our wish is to look upon it at Earth end.
[21:38.14]Haze upon it for eternal bliss.
[21:45.64]How come only two people have a piece of meat?
[21:50.83]Alright, let's go.
[21:57.49]What's next?
[21:58.73]What did they find blocking their way?
[21:59.91]It's demons.
[22:00.69]No, it's the Karmic.
[22:02.57]Alright, so wait.
[22:05.51]Can I use the... Can I get anything new?
[22:13.43]Can't use the fangs?
[22:16.72]Let's just go.
[22:20.98]Let's rest up.
[22:21.61]We got a big day tomorrow.
[22:28.21]Okay, here we go.
[22:31.81]One, two, three, and then we start.
[22:34.72]And we go, wait, we just start.
[22:36.08]Now.
[22:37.42]Go.
[22:47.63]Wait, wait.
[22:48.46]Get it!
[22:49.00]Take it down.
[22:50.68]Climb it?
[23:16.80]Kill it!
[23:23.81]Get up there!
[23:24.49]Wait, it won't crumble.
[23:29.53]But why?
[23:30.47]Do we have to go home because we're not strong enough?
[24:07.56]Oh, okay.
[24:12.06]Can I pause this?
[24:17.58]You guys are getting a delay.
[24:19.04]Because people think I'm missing the beat.
[24:21.62]I think there's a delay.
[24:22.36]Because I'm doing it right.
[24:25.88]How do I... I gotta change this.
[24:30.11]There's a delay on here.
[24:37.45]See if this fixes it.
[24:39.75]For a rhythm game, you guys shouldn't have a delay.
[24:41.43]Is it better?
[24:44.53]Better?
[24:44.75]Okay.
[25:19.97]God, don't kill him!

[27:37.23]What?
[27:40.15]Wait, come with us!
[27:40.87]What?
[27:45.48]Can we stop singing?

[28:24.04]kill it we're good it's literally two buttons alright well I just looked at chat to read what you said
[28:51.80]Just rub head and circle belly.
[29:04.73]If you land perfect beats, you can get fever twice as fast.
[29:13.54]Okay.
[29:22.84]Alright, you'll be constantly acquiring new weapons and helmets.
[29:27.04]Don't forget to equip them.
[29:27.92]They'll raise stats like HP and attack power and can become the key to victory.
[29:31.52]Always use Triangle and optimize your Patapon's shoes.
[29:36.47]Sure.
[29:39.81]Okay, Great Warrior Pan Patapon is a legendary hero.
[29:43.15]He'll be the one that restores a master's sprout to full glory.
[29:47.26]Great Jerry, if you could please follow me, I must show you something.
[29:53.37]We need Mater Sprout to return Mater to the Tree of Life back to life.
[29:58.27]This must be done.
[29:59.81]There are rumors of Dodongo.
[30:02.27]The Dodongo ruins just passed Manjaro Hill.
[30:06.07]Defeat Dodongo and return the Mater Sprout.
[30:08.80]These are all made-up words, okay?
[30:10.32]Oh, I can't believe you can't pronounce it.
[30:11.66]Mater.
[30:13.12]These are all made-up fucking words.
[30:29.75]What's the guy from Cars?
[30:30.43]What are you talking about?
[30:35.29]The Cars 2 fan can't pronounce Mater.
[30:40.58]Wait, somebody said... There's one person that was nice to me.
[30:43.00]What does it say?
[30:43.40]Don't feel bad about missing the pattern up.
[30:44.84]You'll get used to it.
[30:46.10]Wow!
[30:47.78]A C!
[30:48.68]And a C of just... Thank you!
[30:52.30]Wow!
[30:53.46]I'm so happy to hear that.
[30:55.20]Holy shit, I... Thank you!
[30:58.76]Thank you!
[30:59.74]Wow!
[31:01.70]I feel great!
[31:02.54]Alright, what did we get?
[31:05.48]Common stone.
[31:06.24]Full of impurities, but vital nevertheless.
[31:12.71]Ooh, there's a shield.
[31:13.51]What is this?
[31:16.87]Key item.
[31:17.23]Man, that guy.
[31:19.73]He's feeding his ego.
[31:20.71]Alright, I want to make some items.
[31:27.83]Here we go, let's equip.
[31:28.57]And should we just do optimize?
[31:32.19]Oh.
[31:32.29]Oh, iron spear, you have an iron spear.
[31:55.34]Damage 6 to 16.
[31:57.36]Ooh.
[31:58.74]Alright, well, yeah, that's good.
[32:02.28]Which, I want you in the front, then.
[32:04.12]Do I have a bow?
[32:06.94]Somebody in the back?
[32:08.30]Uh, I don't have a bow.
[32:10.79]Alright, well, I mean, he has an iron now.
[32:25.61]But I got one.
[32:26.43]How do I put it on?
[32:27.61]Can't make new units yet.
[32:30.21]Oh, okay.
[32:31.97]Well, whatever.
[32:33.07]Alright, let's go.
[32:34.93]Troop's ready.
[32:35.40]Alright, I'm going to get it.
[32:36.28]That one person.
[32:37.80]Don't worry about messing up the patterns.
[32:39.08]You're going to get it.
[32:41.62]See?
[32:43.32]Let's go.
[32:43.78]That person was just... There we go.
[32:59.82]Go, go, Patapon!
[33:03.18]Go, go, Patapon!
[33:07.22]Go, go, Patapon!
[33:09.38]Why are you missing?
[33:11.52]Get it!

[33:16.17]What's wrong?
[33:35.79]Attack it!
[33:44.42]That's funny, why are you jumping?
[33:46.42]Why are they jumping higher?
[33:53.98]What the fuck just happened?
[33:56.72]Dang, it's a drum solo!
[33:59.50]Get over it, Patapons!
[34:01.10]I'm fucking gone, I can do what I want!
[34:12.38]Oh, we got a triangle now.
[34:22.20]Oh, mighty leader, can you hear me?
[34:23.34]Time for you to learn a third song.
[34:28.16]The Chaka Chaka song.
[34:29.75]This is the lament of defense.
[34:31.29]It's easy to get out of tough spots.
[34:36.17]How is it?
[34:36.39]What does it do?
[34:37.27]How do I do it?
[34:39.69]How do I do it?
[34:42.44]Okay, what does it do?
[34:44.76]Defense?
[34:45.56]Whoa.
[35:13.04]I forget it, I don't know what it is.
[35:14.70]Kill.
[35:15.36]This?
[35:15.78]Got it.
[35:16.34]Attack it?
[35:46.22]Split it.
[35:46.96]Alright, now defense.
[35:48.81]Go forward.
[35:50.25]What?
[35:50.43]Hit him.
[35:50.71]Did I block it?
[35:51.41]What is it?
[36:18.31]No, back up, back up, back up!
[36:20.61]Alright, attack!
[36:23.15]Kill him!
[36:24.25]Wait, defense!
[36:30.65]Why'd they put the hat on that guy?
[36:48.71]Kill it!
[36:49.25]No, no, no, no, no!
[36:53.33]Don't go forward!
[36:53.89]Attack!
[36:54.07]Kill him!
[37:10.92]Fuck!
[37:11.92]I forgot the controls!
[37:15.18]Defense!
[37:17.22]I fucked it up.
[37:19.28]Okay.
[37:19.72]Bro!
[37:20.28]Oh, I did it.
[37:22.93]This sounds like the Minions.
[37:51.09]Somebody just lost a shitload of money.
[37:56.12]Betting on the fact that I wasn't going to figure out how to do that.
[37:58.82]Like it was certain.
[38:01.00]Like it was you were certain.
[38:02.10]You put like $500,000 on that.
[38:04.46]It's like what a certain play that is.
[38:06.59]And you just lost a ton of money.
[38:11.33]And in a way I feel bad for you.
[38:14.85]Here you bet against me though.
[38:18.72]If you perfectly time all four beats, you'll hear crystals ding.
[38:21.86]Okay, cool.
[38:24.54]Rack up enough perfect beats and combo points during fever mode to set off the hero mode.
[38:28.02]He'll perform unnatural acts of bravery and might depending on his class.
[38:35.93]Alright, that's cool.
[38:39.51]Jeremy, we finally found the chosen one.
[38:50.56]I heard it's an old legend.
[38:52.22]Funny-looking mask dude will save the world after meeting Jera the Great Patagon.
[38:57.87]Funny-looking?
[39:00.23]Great Jera, what should we call this strange masked fellow?
[39:03.82]Call me?
[39:04.16]You're gonna name me?
[39:05.10]Oh, you must be insane.
[39:06.06]In the membrane.
[39:32.70]Hera is a very nice name.
[39:34.00]I love it.
[39:36.99]Hera!
[39:38.15]I guess Hera it is.
[39:39.15]Like, I have a choice.
[39:41.39]It's Jera, right?
[39:42.57]Here's the deal.
[39:43.17]I must obey the one that names me, which means you.
[39:48.75]Oh, great Jera and brave Hera.
[39:50.33]Please come this way.
[39:55.36]This is the Paragetrine.
[39:57.38]Only Jera and Hera can enter.
[39:58.72]If you have a mysterious egg, you can interact with heroes from other worlds.
[40:05.30]Can't run out of mysterious eggs, so don't worry.
[40:06.98]Guys, they're Patapons.
[40:10.98]Do you really care about naming them?
[40:13.32]Let's check it out.
[40:20.67]I was going to just press enter.
[40:25.03]I was going to just press enter on hero.
[40:28.99]Alright, let's go in here.
[40:36.62]Please don't forget the Mater sprout.
[40:38.24]We need it to succeed.
[40:39.90]But you were the chosen one.
[40:41.10]You can teleport to another world?
[40:44.76]Okay.
[40:46.26]That's cool.
[40:47.30]Should we do that?
[40:51.66]Here.

[40:57.36]Who are these people?
[41:02.44]Formation.

[41:09.73]It grants Demerion's power.
[41:12.51]He, Lord of Halon, in fire, retardens.
[41:15.97]Okay.

[44:55.63]A hundred community subs.
[45:01.33]Holy shit.
[45:02.49]Thank you for that.
[45:04.82]Maybe there'd be an insane amount of subs.

[46:06.72]Okay, he's running away.
[46:08.88]Pick it up.
[46:36.61]What do I have to do with this?
[46:42.01]Is there like a slot?
[46:47.39]Timing's way off.
[46:48.17]It's not.
[46:48.75]I mean, it was right there.
[46:50.72]Look, there's a delay.
[46:51.96]There's a desync that I can't... Just hold on a second.
[47:12.50]Attack.
[47:13.59]There's a tiny bit on this.
[47:21.15]These guys don't look strong enough.

[49:43.73]Oh, it's copyright.
[49:47.07]No, no, this is not copyright.
[49:56.92]Fucking copyright!
[50:00.00]God damn it, I'll see you guys later.
[50:01.22]Fuck.
[50:02.12]I'm out.
[50:09.87]How was I supposed to know this fucking whole game was copyrighted?
[50:11.61]What the fuck?
[50:12.95]That's how they do it to me.
[50:14.23]Ooh, there's a treasure chest?
[50:16.39]Wait, how much does it cost?
[50:17.89]60?
[50:17.93]Shit.
[50:18.31]I got adamantium.
[50:28.62]Okay, hold on a minute.
[50:29.88]Do you want to change Parachari into Ka-ching and return to Patopolis?
[50:37.70]Like, I just opened up, like, my teenager's phone and looking at text messages, and I don't know what these things mean.
[50:45.28]What is he saying when he's talking to his friend?
[50:47.96]Uh, do I want to change Chari into Ka-ching?
[50:55.07]Yes, I think.
[50:58.28]I don't know what that does.
[51:00.66]What is it?
[51:04.85]There's a delay on the fucking stupid ass thing.
[51:12.19]Try to fix it.
[51:13.77]It's ruined.
[51:17.09]The Patagate is a portal that connects fragments from other Patapon worlds.
[51:21.63]There's a distinct beat that permeates throughout this realm.
[51:24.66]Listen closely to its rhythm dawn, chin, can, high.
[51:30.68]Success will only be achieved if all hero Patapons follow this special rhythm.
[51:34.54]Thought I turned off my Discord notifications.
[51:39.63]Don't call me.
[51:42.55]Um... A hundred community subs.
[51:47.88]From Zixia.
[51:48.32]I want to make sure I address it, because that's a fucking ton of money.
[51:51.67]That's $500 that they just dropped.
[51:52.99]I'll be able to buy those.
[51:56.45]Thanks.
[51:56.71]That's fucking insane.
[51:58.57]Thank you.
[51:58.97]It's kind of... Will we cut the dinosaur's head off?
[52:16.35]That's a hundred Little Caesars pizzas.
[52:23.02]I mean, yeah, I guess it is.
[52:24.80]Alright, so that was like a little encounter.
[52:34.40]Oh, this game's pretty cute.
[52:36.94]This is a cool game.
[52:38.01]Alright.
[52:38.69]We got all this other stuff.
[52:44.58]Life Seed is hidden somewhere in the ancient ruins.
[52:46.38]Defeat the Dodonga at the Dodong... Defeat the Dodonga at the Dongara Ruins.
[52:52.85]Ooh, this is the Spro.
[52:53.91]Okay, here we go.
[52:56.99]Let's do some equipment.
[52:59.43]Let's do some optimization.
[53:00.65]Okay.
[53:03.23]Iron Spears, Wooden Helm.
[53:04.85]Iron Helm.
[53:05.31]Ooh, I got an Iron Helm.
[53:07.69]Lordly Hairpiece.
[53:08.48]No.
[53:08.72]We don't have any more Iron Helms?
[53:14.12]Okay, put on that funny hair.
[53:15.18]What are you?
[53:19.52]Friendship spear.
[53:21.76]Yeah.
[53:22.34]Friendship helm.
[53:23.64]That's all I got.
[53:25.30]Put the funny hair on.
[53:27.16]No, no, no, no.
[53:29.08]Alright, I think I'm ready.
[53:33.87]A bunch of iron helms.
[53:35.01]Look, they're all not wearing them.
[53:45.54]Bow, bow, bow, bow.
[53:46.78]You can change the mask dude's class.
[53:48.84]Hero mask of phantom strike.
[53:54.82]I don't think I can do a bow.
[53:59.47]Let's rest up.
[54:00.67]We got a big day.
[54:22.59]It can't be offbeat.
[54:24.09]I wouldn't have a fever right now.
[54:55.40]What?
[54:55.70]I just defended!
[54:57.79]Are we alright?
[55:02.41]Oh shit!
[55:04.07]Pen!
[55:31.80]Attack!
[55:33.32]Throw.
[55:34.08]Fuck.
[55:34.84]Good.
[55:35.10]What?
[55:35.34]Wait, we're dead.
[56:00.36]Wait, what?
[56:01.12]Does defend not happen until after they sing it?
[56:03.08]Because I defended and then he hit me.
[56:11.88]It wasn't ready?
[56:12.46]Do they have to sing it first?
[56:15.62]So is it like when I do... Does it take one?
[56:20.59]It's too low?
[56:23.83]Why'd they all leave?
[56:24.45]Does nobody think I'm cool anymore?
[56:29.21]Oh, this guy's not... This guy didn't die, didn't like that.
[56:32.63]We're gone.
[56:33.85]New god.
[56:34.39]They defend right when the beat finishes.
[56:42.08]Okay.
[56:45.84]Try again.
[56:55.58]How long does the defend last?
[57:00.50]Because in one of those things, it's like, oh, it's like two seconds or three seconds.
[57:03.33]There's the next bar.
[57:04.29]One turn, okay?
[57:04.99]Oh.
[57:05.09]Alright, now here we go.
[57:29.51]Okay.
[57:31.48]Did it.
[57:37.24]Who's- Who just got struck by fucking lightning?
[57:40.76]How do you get back?
[57:44.25]Is it like a go back command?
[57:47.15]What's like the go back command?
[57:48.99]What is it?
[57:49.55]I don't have that yet.
[57:54.96]Oh.
[58:01.05]Wait, am I supposed to be here?
[58:02.91]I think I did it.
[58:28.70]What's with the lightning?
[58:30.68]Oh, so I have to bend?
[58:32.77]We're gonna have to start with our fucking lightning again.
[58:38.97]Don't!
[58:41.57]Don't!
[58:44.28]Come on!
[58:54.00]Get the fuck outta here!
[58:55.96]Back up!
[58:56.95]Do it!
[58:57.31]Back up!
[58:59.61]I'm gonna die.
[59:01.19]I need the guy- I need that fucking funny hat on.
[59:28.55]What the fuck?
[59:31.79]Is it the armor?
[59:33.07]I have iron armor on?
[59:36.11]Is that the problem?
[59:37.05]Oh, we're dead again.
[59:39.97]But this lightning is just destroying me.
[59:44.53]Alright, well, I gotta get like lightning resistant.
[59:48.01]I have to go back and grind?
[59:50.27]Wait, I can do that?
[59:53.01]I have to play other, wait, hold on, what?
[59:59.29]Oh.
[60:00.25]It's not just play the game.
[60:01.49]I have to go back and, like, grind for items?
[60:07.19]I gotta grind.
[60:10.15]Um, I... Hold on.
[60:12.71]Let me go look at my stuff.
[60:18.31]You're offbeat.
[60:19.15]I'm... I can't get fevers because this... You're not... I have a shitty Elgato.
[60:31.51]You are offbeat.
[60:32.25]How do I get fevers then?
[60:33.25]That doesn't make any sense.
[60:34.04]Alright, so why does fever appear on screen?
[60:41.04]What are we talking about?
[60:41.80]It's pity fevers.
[60:50.29]Can we go over this right now?
[60:53.65]Is there a delay when I'm selecting these?
[60:55.01]You guys have seen a delay.
[60:55.81]You have to be.
[61:06.87]What?
[61:07.94]The drums sound different.
[61:09.38]What?
[61:14.06]Just emulate it.
[61:24.69]I'm going to try this.
[61:26.31]Let's see what they have for equipment.
[61:28.77]Okay, what about with my resistance?
[61:31.93]This guy has a hat on.
[61:39.91]Iron helm.
[61:40.57]Wait, was that person lying to me or does this actually conduct electricity with lightning?
[61:47.01]Keep gaslighting him, we almost got him.
[61:50.29]No, it happened like 20 minutes ago.
[62:05.46]He almost got him.
[62:08.74]Let me try this again.
[62:09.30]I can't, I don't have any other gear.
[62:11.80]Alright, if I don't do this now, then I'm gonna go back and get better stuff.
[62:19.98]Here we go.
[62:41.00]Here we go.
[62:43.23]Fuck.
[62:44.71]Fuck.
[62:45.27]Attack.
[62:48.77]Attack.
[62:51.77]Attack.
[63:12.25]Forward!
[63:16.75]Forward!
[63:17.73]Where is he?
[63:41.51]Attack.
[63:42.83]Attack.
[64:07.32]Forward!
[64:08.78]You guys talk about perfects!
[64:37.78]Doesn't it have to be perfect every time?
[64:40.10]What?
[65:24.42]You gotta get perfect if you don't hear the symbol then don't play the video game I forgot Didn't break combo all the entire game, but didn't get it perfect every time why even Why even load the video game in the first place?
[65:40.39]I mean what the hell?
[65:44.61]Load up a fucking robot to make every press perfect.
[65:48.33]What are you, fucking stupid?
[66:00.34]I did it.
[66:00.64]Am I on easy?
[66:02.68]No.
[66:08.24]Simply keep to the rhythm for a few counts and score multiple combo points.
[66:11.32]Soon you'll be in fever mode.
[66:14.39]When the Patapons are in fever mode, their attack and defense skills increase dramatically.
[66:18.08]Cool!
[66:18.64]Yeah, what's the next paragraph say?
[66:20.20]Oh, if you don't get perfect every time, uninstall this game.
[66:23.59]Oh, is that what it's... I can't see.
[66:25.51]Should I zoom in?
[66:26.39]Does it say that anywhere?
[66:27.45]Where does it say that?
[66:28.33]I'm just trying to find where it says that.
[66:38.57]It's- it's- you have to scroll.
[66:41.03]Ah shit, I- where- I'm sorry, I didn't scroll.
[66:49.19]It scrolled down.
[66:53.01]You guys are fucked.
[66:54.15]Alright, let's go.
[66:56.42]Awaken from a sleep that has overtaken your roots.
[67:16.64]Oh, we had huge money.
[67:17.38]Hold on.
[67:19.92]Throwaway985.
[67:20.64]Thanks for $50.
[67:21.70]Thanks for the huge money, Throwaway985.
[67:27.67]Thank you so much.
[67:36.33]They say, hey, Jerma, have bits.
[67:37.71]I'm not letting the government have this money.
[67:40.03]Chat are paid actors.
[67:41.81]Top donators are your gambling addiction fencing money.
[67:44.51]I know the truth.
[67:45.53]Stay safe and marry the McChicken Queen already.
[67:51.14]Are you guys like paid actors?
[67:52.22]Is somebody... Are you guys just getting paid from somebody to come and tell me that I can't get perfects every time?
[67:59.39]Somebody's going to be paying you.
[68:02.43]It seems like too much work.
[68:07.00]Are they right?
[68:11.66]Wait, you guys aren't getting paid?
[68:15.82]Wait, you getting paid?
[68:17.51]Who's getting paid?
[68:26.97]I'm not at liberty, Shay.
[68:31.68]Oh, let's see.
[68:32.79]Legendary memory.
[68:33.71]286.
[68:34.23]Ka-ching.
[68:34.67]Is this where I get another person?
[68:37.47]Wait.
[68:38.89]Confirm.
[68:40.45]So, these are my slots?
[68:42.77]Hey, Kazzy, thanks for the five subs, Kazzy.
[68:45.17]Five community subs.
[68:48.19]Just dropped him right now.
[68:49.11]Thank you.
[68:50.81]So, should I get a Tatepon?
[68:58.58]Normal.
[68:58.84]Evolution map.
[69:02.47]what the fuck normal level one cafeteria meat um okay I can only do this create normal a normal Patapon it's one meat one stone and twelve dollars oh okay we can turn him into a Piyopio a Puyopio
[69:33.54]Hard iron.
[69:34.19]Okay.
[69:36.31]Tender meat.
[69:36.95]These extra large size Patapons are great against knockback.
[69:44.05]Okay.
[69:44.45]Resistance against cold, but weak against fire.
[69:49.08]Hmm.
[69:49.88]Okay.
[69:50.02]Should I get another one?
[69:51.96]Should I just get two?
[69:53.48]I should get another Yaripon.
[69:56.34]Hmm.
[69:57.74]Should I fill it up?
[70:01.29]Whoa.
[70:01.61]Whoa.
[70:04.74]Set your TV to game mode.
[70:09.46]I'm not on a TV.
[70:10.89]It's always so funny going to somebody's house that had that shit.
[70:22.41]Where there was like a full half second input delay.
[70:26.06]And they didn't even know it existed.
[70:29.06]And you sit there and you grab the controller or you try to do something and you're like, holy shit.
[70:36.55]And then you change it and they're like, what did you do?
[70:39.17]This doesn't feel right anymore.
[70:41.87]What the fuck?
[70:42.65]It's like, dude, you have... Okay.
[70:49.24]Let's get another one.
[70:56.28]Here we go.
[70:56.68]We're gonna plant another person.
[71:00.23]Here they come.
[71:05.00]Okay.
[71:06.12]Let's do another one.
[71:06.72]I got money, right?
[71:10.52]Wait, what's this?
[71:11.74]Oh, I didn't see it.
[71:12.52]So I have three Yarupons and three Tatapons?
[71:19.73]Should I just fill it up?
[71:30.23]No stones.
[71:32.23]Oh, I don't have any more stones.
[71:35.11]Well, I have three guys now.
[71:41.76]Okay.
[71:47.35]Master will surely be of use to you.
[71:49.37]Mater, whatever it is.
[71:53.07]Can I... Look at all this stuff.
[71:55.78]New shields.
[71:56.52]Alright, I got some new stuff.
[71:57.40]I gotta look.
[72:01.37]Alright, well here we are.
[72:03.22]Harman Fortress.
[72:04.50]Did you use the Tree of Life to befriend some Tatapons?
[72:07.62]The time has come to rally the Patapons and head out for Earthen.
[72:09.84]Alright, so I need... Where's my... Where's my Tatapons?
[72:19.54]Oh, alright.
[72:22.98]There they are.
[72:25.70]What do they got?
[72:29.92]Optimize.
[72:32.37]Whoa!
[72:34.97]Friendship sword, wooden helm, and friendship shield.
[72:39.87]Steel shield.
[72:40.93]Pin axe.
[72:44.49]What's a friendship sword do?
[72:48.57]Oh, raise the HP.
[72:50.31]What's HP at now?
[72:51.11]300 versus 200.
[72:51.95]That's pretty good.
[72:53.55]Okay.
[72:55.15]What about you guys?
[72:58.18]Optimize.
[72:58.52]It always takes the hat off.
[73:04.79]What about you?
[73:05.57]Optimon.
[73:07.58]Oh.
[73:09.44]Blast.
[73:10.88]Evolve to Yaripon.
[73:12.72]Evolve to Patapon.
[73:13.68]Special move.
[73:14.28]Energy... Hold on.
[73:18.10]The Iron Fist.
[73:18.98]Causes damage over a wide area.
[73:20.40]Effective against enemy structures and any enemy nearby.
[73:22.50]Energy Field.
[73:25.32]Surround all Patapons in an impermeable protective shield.
[73:28.39]A major drawback is that the shield will limit the troops' attack abilities.
[73:33.54]Damn it.
[73:34.02]Iron Fist.
[73:34.52]Let's do this one.
[73:36.24]Does it work?
[73:39.28]Evolve to Yeripon.
[73:42.72]How do I do that?
[73:49.63]He already is a Yeripon.
[73:50.69]Oh.
[73:51.67]Alright.
[73:53.27]Let's move up.
[73:54.23]Shuba-duba-doo.
[74:03.36]Cool.
[74:07.26]Here we go.
[74:08.22]The Patapons are here.
[74:10.15]One, two, three, four.
[74:11.87]Attack.
[74:12.63]How do you do this move?
[74:37.73]Oops.
[74:40.12]Get off!
[74:41.20]Alright, now attack.
[74:42.62]Kill!
[75:23.80]I've got it.
[75:24.94]Coins.
[75:55.59]Bow.
[75:56.39]Bow and arrow guy.
[76:00.27]Go forward!
[76:01.69]Here we go.
[76:24.35]They're on game mode.
[76:26.47]Forward!
[76:26.89]Attack!
[76:28.15]Forward!
[77:07.29]Forward!
[77:11.92]And... Kill!
[77:13.78]You think Carmen?
[77:17.72]Go!
[77:53.80]Back up!
[77:54.24]What?
[77:55.62]I don't understand.
[78:27.34]Oh, this is not correct.
[78:28.38]None of your commands are on beat.
[78:31.12]That doesn't make any sense.
[78:33.28]Somebody said, it's getting old, chat.
[79:06.74]We'll just leave him!
[79:08.06]Ooh!
[79:41.35]Two consecutive beats takes it- Oh, okay.
[79:46.01]Alright.
[79:47.65]Sorry, I was reading.
[79:52.51]Wait, hold on.
[79:53.32]The PS4 remaster has a slight audio delay.
[79:56.18]That's why it's not on beat.
[79:58.52]You notice that sometimes the plato or the pawns sound different.
[80:01.08]That means it's on beat.
[80:03.28]Wait, the PS4 remaster has an audio delay?
[80:05.33]Am I being lied to?
[80:19.60]It's real.
[80:20.56]It's true?
[80:22.00]I'm seeing a lot of one guy say it's real.
[80:33.37]Well, whatever.
[80:33.97]Who cares?
[80:34.71]It is real.
[80:38.12]Google it.
[80:40.40]Patapon 2 remaster audio delay?
[80:44.76]Why did I put an X?
[80:46.64]I asked a question.
[80:56.13]Ironically, the first Patapon Remastered also had this delay issue and it hasn't been fixed despite Patapon 2 Remastered launching nearly three years later.
[81:03.45]You'll need to play with headphones to eliminate the sound lag that's introduced between the controller and the TV.
[81:09.08]What?!
[81:11.34]This shit is real!
[81:19.72]Wait, what?
[81:23.74]Oh no, this is bad.
[81:27.80]It's pulling through a capture card, so it's always gonna be bad.
[81:31.44]It's always gonna be fucked up.
[81:36.73]I don't think I'm ever gonna get it right.
[81:37.97]They didn't fix the input delay for Patapon 2.
[81:42.19]Hold on.
[81:47.32]It was unplayable in the first Patapon.
[81:50.20]To be honest, it's a little better on this one.
[81:51.54]We still have to really be sharp when playing the songs.
[81:53.60]I was expecting some kind of calibration system like in Guitar Hero.
[81:58.29]The real problem is the controller has a big input delay because of the wireless that happens to almost any Bluetooth device.
[82:03.13]Try watching a movie on a Bluetooth speaker.
[82:04.97]Wait, what?
[82:12.00]I tried playing with a metronome at 120 beats per minute, which is the beat of Patapon.
[82:23.07]do you have any idea how streaming works do I have to actually answer this
[82:54.81]Wait, how do you think you're seeing the video game?
[82:59.65]I'm using telepathy to give you this on the screen?
[83:28.33]I'm delayed by 650 milliseconds because I'm going through the capture.
[83:33.10]That is not going to work because I have to delay this by 650 milliseconds for you to hear it.
[83:38.26]Alright, so just do it earlier is what the goal is.
[83:40.94]Does this prove?
[83:46.59]This proves I apparently have to hit it like a quarter of a second earlier than I am.
[83:51.35]Later.
[83:52.63]Let me try that theory.
[83:57.07]Hold on.
[84:01.69]Do it earlier.
[84:07.77]Let's just try this out.
[84:09.51]Let's just go to level 1.
[84:10.55]See, I'm just going to level 1.
[84:13.49]Let me get this right.
[84:15.66]Okay, let's deploy.
[84:18.28]Set it to easy.
[84:21.24]Hold on.
[84:21.90]Let's just see.
[84:24.66]Let's do easy mode.
[84:27.92]So, earlier.
[84:28.24]Earlier.
[84:37.42]Later?
[84:38.72]I don't understand.
[85:08.99]So, is it slower?
[85:11.55]Okay, hold on.
[85:14.65]No.
[85:14.87]Okay, here's how I'm doing it.
[85:17.55]No, it's not working that way.
[85:56.91]It's slower.
[86:04.62]Irma, what the hell are you saying?
[86:05.68]It makes no sense.
[86:06.32]It would be delayed for us in .U.
[86:10.96]Were you here when we just talked about how this is like a game issue?
[86:13.28]Oh, welcome!
[86:22.51]Hi!
[86:38.63]let me I wish I could hear this it's playable it's just you're stressing over nothing yeah I kind of don't give a shit I'm just gonna play the game I'm just gonna play like whatever who cares
[87:08.19]If it's not going to be perfect, it's not going to be perfect.
[87:10.25]This fucking game was remastered like shit.
[87:13.15]What do you want me to say?
[87:18.41]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[87:22.66]I can make other characters.
[87:32.72]There, yes.
[87:50.30]How much do they cost?
[87:54.54]I can make another one.
[88:06.67]Here they come.
[88:24.49]Here it comes.
[88:32.27]Do you not split?
[88:33.05]I'm not... I do... I play on a monitor.
[88:39.90]I capture it through OBS and I'm playing the game captured on my monitor.
[88:43.88]I'm not playing on the OBS window.
[89:04.09]Turn the volume up and then down.
[89:05.68]What the fuck?
[89:09.65]Alright, I'm gonna play the fucking game.
[89:12.95]What are you talking about?
[89:38.34]One, two, three.
[89:40.30]What?
[89:40.82]Where is he?
[90:14.95]Is that like a boss?
[90:18.37]I got this other tower.
[90:24.80]Get that gore!
[91:16.22]Alright, go for it.
[91:20.28]Alright, now go ahead.
[91:46.80]Fire is killing us!
[91:47.68]Look!
[91:53.01]I'm a gamer?
[92:00.21]What?
[92:02.41]Get in!
[92:23.31]Holy shit, I'm getting destroyed.
[92:24.53]Oh shit, I'm fucking dead.
[92:28.44]Keep going.
[92:30.96]I'm trying.
[92:34.38]They got a lot more people than I do.
[93:00.99]Too fast?
[93:01.57]I don't get it, man.
[93:03.03]I gotta like... I don't know.
[93:05.85]Alright, get in.
[93:50.71]You guys aren't even very good.
[93:53.09]I'm losing too many people.
[93:57.66]Alright now, go forward.
[94:22.25]Stop playing this game, I'm tired of dancing.
[95:11.66]I'm trying to do it later.
[96:03.94]what happens in Jerma smokes DMT what I only got like two guys left I'm dead
[96:42.82]Maybe not.
[96:45.10]Oh, he's dead.
[96:46.78]Alright, go ahead.
[96:49.98]Oh, fuck!
[96:50.42]Stop!
[97:13.23]Protect that guy.
[97:17.89]Go back.
[97:40.45]Do something.
[97:41.13]Do it.
[98:11.02]Many casualties.
[98:46.48]High tech.
[98:47.06]High tech.
[98:48.46]Hey, I still won.
[99:06.19]The Ziggoton hero, Gong the Hawkeye, appeared as the Patapon's rival in the first game.
[99:12.44]Spoilers, thanks a lot.
[99:14.02]He fought for the Ziggoton queen, Karma, to stop the Patapon's invasion of his land.
[99:19.94]He went two to two against the Patapons, but they fucking killed him.
[99:35.83]What if it burns one's eyes?
[99:38.09]Our scouts have located a giant Mon Chi-Chi on the Sutton Plains.
[99:43.73]Long might be a problem, but me Dan will be wor-way-whatever.
[99:46.41]I wanna make a new guy.
[99:54.79]Fuck.
[99:55.09]I need a bone.
[100:04.00]Shit.
[100:06.80]Plumps of grass.
[100:09.07]Okay.
[100:09.79]This guy drops bones?
[100:10.77]Ooh.
[100:12.77]Wait.
[100:13.41]Should I go in here?
[100:13.87]Can I make other units?
[100:23.90]How many people can you have in one squad?
[100:30.02]Ooh, I can make these.
[100:32.18]Ooh.
[100:37.08]Wait, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[100:39.92]I can make a Piyo Piyo.
[100:40.98]Should I make a Piyo Piyo?
[100:44.32]Resistance against cold chills.
[100:45.66]There's a lot of fire units.
[100:52.09]I feel like it's probably better to make another one.
[101:04.41]Maybe another Katapon?
[101:09.14]Alright, I'm gonna make another catapult.
[101:14.28]Okay.
[101:17.76]Go look at the crew.
[101:22.07]Fill the squads out first?
[101:23.21]Yeah.
[101:25.47]What is this?
[101:32.35]Okay.
[101:34.92]Okay.
[101:40.74]Oh, we almost got a full squad.
[101:46.72]Steel helm, steel helm.
[101:47.96]Still have wooden spears.
[101:50.02]What the fuck is this bullshit?
[102:03.46]Friendship bow.
[102:04.44]Iron bow.
[102:04.92]Does the iron bow do more damage?
[102:07.24]No.
[102:07.42]It does not.
[102:10.47]Why am I not upgrading?
[102:11.51]I don't know.
[102:14.38]Should I save the resources or should I just start upgrading people?
[102:18.86]Let's go like Yaripon.
[102:23.40]I can do this, but I can't do this one.
[102:26.13]What about the other guys?
[102:26.91]What about these dudes?
[102:31.39]Yeah, I'm on a full squad first.
[102:41.97]Can I afford another one of these guys?
[102:50.64]No.
[102:56.37]Okay.
[103:00.05]So now I got 6-6.
[103:02.68]I wonder if this will be good.
[103:03.38]Let's see if this works.
[103:12.35]The game lags after I open a menu?
[103:19.48]This game's just full of problems tonight, huh?
[103:26.82]Emulator on.
[103:29.95]What about you?
[103:30.35]Do you still have stuff?
[103:31.89]What can you do?
[103:33.61]Friendship spear, friendship helm.
[103:35.11]What's this?
[103:36.23]Oh, the hairpiece.
[103:36.87]No.
[103:36.97]No.
[103:37.95]Optimized.
[103:42.98]This is so much... I have so many more units.
[103:44.79]Let's do it.
[103:45.21]Let's go.
[103:49.97]This is going to be the only Patapon stream.
[104:02.93]You don't know that yet.
[104:11.35]Bad guys?
[104:13.95]Oh shit, I... Did I... Did I have killed you?
[104:24.43]Holy shit.
[104:25.23]Alright, defend.
[104:29.21]No, never mind.
[104:30.73]Phone.

[106:24.03]Probably not.
[106:35.05]I like this game.
[106:37.66]This game's fucking really, really fun.
[106:39.40]I really like it.
[106:45.81]It's very fun.
[106:50.11]If I have to deal with a bad port, I'll deal with a bad port.
[107:15.81]Still fun.
[107:17.29]I still like it.
[107:27.76]It isn't a bad port.
[107:49.82]Imagine playing this on a cartridge.
[108:06.07]He won't emulate the- I don't- I don't know- Dude, what- I don't know, a DS emulator?
[108:13.17]I don't know where the fuck we can get one of those.
[108:26.49]PSP emulator?
[108:28.01]Look, when I bought the remaster, how was I supposed to know there was like audio input problems?
[108:37.83]How the fuck was I supposed to know that?
[109:35.33]I got a lot of health Can I even kill this thing?
[110:08.06]It's running!
[110:13.48]Put it on easy?
[110:16.38]I will.
[110:19.61]I will after this.
[110:41.06]You want to negate some of the grinding?
[110:44.33]Is that what it does?
[110:46.79]Jesus!
[111:15.21]It's a very grindy game.
[111:17.29]Kill!
[111:17.81]Block!

[112:18.28]I thought he was going to way turn.
[112:29.39]He's going back.
[112:31.33]He's backing up.
[112:31.89]Alright, block.
[112:55.30]Fuck.
[113:06.49]I got him!
[113:12.35]He's playing on hard.
[113:18.92]I thought- isn't this on normal?
[113:35.90]okay I got it possible to lose their stance and easily stagger once their HP is low if an eye open has dizzy staggered bosses have a tendency to drop items that's where I got the red one from I got a red item alright let's see what I got
[114:05.58]Dodeca bone.
[114:06.60]A large bone from the carcass of a large beast.
[114:08.30]These huge bones are often used in the central pillars in homes.
[114:15.79]How do I put this on easy?
[114:23.71]Will that actually help with the input stuff?
[114:26.94]Back to the title screen.
[114:38.00]Alright, let's go back to town.
[114:49.90]Level selection, normal.
[114:53.12]Alright, but... But speak... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[115:06.21]It's a documented issue.
[115:08.85]You can't look at that and make fun of me.
[115:10.77]It's not fair.
[115:11.57]It's a documented issue.
[115:13.23]Can I try the headphones thing?
[115:25.08]Wait a minute.
[115:25.42]Headphones.
[115:26.67]Let me see if that helps.
[115:45.54]Let's test it.
[115:48.38]Because maybe it was on speakers and maybe that's fucked up.
[116:01.31]I don't know.
[116:04.01]It didn't save?
[116:04.59]Yeah, it did.
[116:08.11]Here we go.
[116:08.43]Ready?
[116:33.56]No, it's the same exact problem.
[116:35.77]I have both headphones in.
[116:41.29]Let me try it real- Let's put it on easy and see what happens.
[116:47.91]You failed.
[116:49.25]Yeah, sometimes you fail.
[117:00.05]Oh, what the fuck do I care?
[117:13.27]Alright, here we go.
[117:23.59]I did get some new stuff though, hold on.
[117:31.45]Friendship sword?
[117:32.57]I didn't get anything else.
[117:34.15]Wooden helm.
[117:35.49]Do one of you guys in the middle put the hair on?
[117:46.18]I've got a bunch of materials.
[117:47.36]Do I have to craft them or something?
[117:56.48]No bullies, please.
[118:00.55]Let's see.
[118:03.77]What can I do?
[118:10.41]I cannot.
[118:13.07]Normal level 2.
[118:15.60]I need two more stones and two more fangs.
[118:23.00]Hey, Ben, thanks for the five community subs.

[118:29.91]Upgrade the hero?
[118:33.37]Um... How do you upgrade the hero?
[118:35.43]Oh, we can do this now, right?
[118:53.03]Heroes inherit upgrades from anyone in the class.
[118:55.15]Oh, okay.
[118:58.24]Mission 8.
[118:58.58]Do I go for this?
[119:00.90]I hope I don't lose out on this.
[119:06.72]Don't waste your time with this.
[119:11.26]Change the egg.
[119:13.33]Wait, change the... Oh, alright.
[119:20.59]Level 2.
[119:23.47]That's alright.
[119:23.95]This is how you get better masks, alright.
[119:58.10]okay I get it I'm like I don't think it matters
[120:48.00]This mode is always in normal.
[120:49.36]Oh, okay.
[120:50.31]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[120:53.93]Fuck, I thought he was gonna attack.
[121:37.80]Yep.
[121:38.14]Nah.
[121:38.72]Nah.
[121:39.74]Nah.
[122:02.66]Let's see what happens on Easy if it fixes the issue.
[122:12.10]It's emulated.
[122:12.88]Go ahead and get it on PSP.
[122:13.68]It worked.
[122:30.15]Mission failed?
[122:31.09]Wait, what?
[122:31.81]How?
[122:34.27]I was walking forward.
[122:43.20]Read?
[122:43.84]I was too busy getting angry at the fact that the input works now.
[123:02.44]How do you fail a cutscene?
[123:03.66]I'm not even looking at the screen.
[123:06.58]Alright, listen up.
[123:10.20]Uh.
[123:11.14]What?
[123:50.64]I was failing for views Alright, let's get perfect literally every fucking single time I do this now this is windows a little bigger just fixes the goddamn I'm not gonna I'm not gonna get angry about this.
[124:02.46]Let's go
[124:06.48]Get in there!
[124:34.74]Get that thing!
[125:05.75]Kill it!
[125:07.05]Kill!
[125:07.55]Whoa!
[125:52.47]What was that?
[125:54.01]It just gave me a new thing to do!
[126:06.31]Wait, what?
[126:06.97]Can I do it now?
[126:10.97]I have to do it while it happens?
[126:14.99]Wait, I have to do it when that pops up?
[126:24.43]That was like teaching me Yeah
[127:02.42]This is way... The window is way better now.
[127:10.03]Let's do it again.
[127:20.49]You know they have X or circle or whatever.
[127:26.84]Papaya.
[127:29.45]So the idea is you grind out levels to get materials to make you guys better to do the later levels.
[127:36.14]Okay, I get it.
[127:36.48]Alright, this time I gotta do the beat that pops up on that scroll.
[127:39.69]Let's go.
[128:18.16]Alright, where's that crab?
[128:22.20]Here we go.
[128:22.96]Okay, here it comes.
[128:59.46]How do I do that?
[129:01.15]Now I'm doing it.
[129:03.11]Be closer?
[129:03.67]Square, triangle, square.
[129:12.69]It's not working.
[129:18.31]Square, triangle, square.
[129:19.91]What?
[129:22.02]When I hit triangle, it says no.
[129:38.81]Press it, not sit.
[129:39.63]I did!
[129:40.12]I'm gonna fail the rhythm, but that's normal.
[129:45.60]Wait.
[129:46.78]Did I do it?
[129:53.04]You don't need to do it with the rhythm.
[129:57.72]I thought I had to do it with the rhythm.
[130:12.71]I got too close to the totem.
[130:14.77]Cancel combos and just do it.
[130:44.16]I guess I'm going to do it again.
[130:48.20]I need the materials anyway.
[130:51.40]Okay, so...
[131:16.07]Okay, so when that, I see that pull, to the beat, just do it.
[131:20.67]It doesn't matter, even if it doesn't do anything.
[131:22.63]You just have to press it.
[131:25.71]To the rhythm.
[131:31.11]I feel like I was trying to do that, but even if they go, uh-oh, like, no, that was wrong, just do it.
[131:47.21]It's not a real command.
[131:48.23]It's a Patapon.
[131:50.03]Just push through and keep on beat.
[131:51.23]Oh, okay.
[131:52.83]Well, I'll try it again.
[132:03.82]Do it as soon as you see the totem.
[132:05.90]Do it four times in a row.
[132:07.10]Okay.
[132:08.14]Cool.
[132:41.58]Forward, forward, forward, forward.
[132:42.70]Where's that pole?
[132:43.94]Here we go.
[132:45.14]I can't see what it said.
[132:49.27]What is it?
[132:51.55]Square, triangle, what is it?
[133:11.86]Square, triangle, square, triangle.
[133:13.86]What?
[133:14.02]I have to be closer?
[133:15.59]I thought it didn't matter.
[133:42.42]Okay.
[133:44.92]Oh, fucking God damn it.
[133:47.02]Thanks for the key, bye.
[134:37.77]Alright, collect.
[135:07.21]This game is confusing my cat.
[135:17.62]What is your cat watching?
[135:20.69]Why is your cat watching this?
[135:24.65]It should be sleeping and eating like cat food.
[135:35.55]They're too close to the screen!
[135:36.67]Tell them to back up!
[135:59.98]A Ching are golden coins that shine like newborn stars.
[136:02.56]Their glimmer of energy come from the life force they possess.
[136:04.76]Wow.
[136:06.52]Each coin is a Patapon's life energy, so it's a soul.
[136:08.80]Okay.

[139:05.84]eight seven seven cash now eight seven seven cash now you have an annuity and you need cash now eight seven seven cash now eight seven seven cash now it fits it helps it's 120 beats per minute this is oh
[139:38.64]Oh great Patapon can you hear me?
[139:55.52]Your eyeball army will melt if they continue to travel to these barren lands without some juju.
[139:59.89]Okay.
[140:06.37]They'll first turn to black puddles and then evaporate.
[140:08.62]Use your juju powers.
[140:09.68]I'll give you a quick lesson on how to use the secrets of the rain juju.
[140:14.10]In order to get your juju going, we first need to reach fever mode.
[140:16.58]Okay, yes.
[140:18.65]Once you enter in fever, hit X, X, X, X, X, don, da-don, da-don.
[140:24.51]When the juju dance begins, listen carefully to Patapon's song and hit the drum to the rhythm.
[140:29.38]Okay, we need to do...
[140:45.73]Okay.
[140:46.09]Hunt, hunt, hunt.
[140:47.49]Hunt, hunt.
[141:29.89]If you get it, rain will help you cool off, and it also has other secret properties.
[141:32.81]Use it to flush out Centura, a beast only visible when it rains!
[141:36.61]Okay, is this the beast?
[142:13.82]Burn it to the center later.
[142:15.08]Good job, Patathons.
[142:28.07]Play the game in mute mode.
[142:32.14]Sorry, a fucking ghost just came out of me.
[142:38.72]I had to put it in a bottle.
[142:40.68]I just had to spit him into a bottle.
[142:44.36]Ice shield.
[142:51.10]Wind currents will always affect your defense, attack, and hunting strategies.
[142:55.18]You should always factor in the direction when planning your adventures.
[142:57.68]Wait, this is... Was it golf?
[143:01.20]All it takes is a careful eye and you'll notice the change in wind direction.
[143:05.52]Sometimes it will blow left, stop, and then blow right.
[143:08.20]Do you notice the pattern?
[143:11.04]Is the... Oh, there's a wind?
[143:16.92]Okay.
[143:20.13]Nice goth reference.
[143:22.57]Last two.

[143:50.09]Fill it up.
[143:51.97]Fuck.
[143:53.13]We're gonna get fangs.
[144:00.38]He shaved down to use his weapon.
[144:01.76]I guess I gotta go hunting.
[144:06.14]Okay.
[144:12.56]Loma level 2.
[144:13.64]I'm gonna go hunting for level 2.
[144:15.54]I'm gonna go get fangs.
[144:18.66]That sounds like a good idea.
[144:21.62]Centura drops fangs.
[144:23.12]Oh.
[144:24.84]Okay.
[144:28.98]Wicked Axe.
[144:30.73]Okay, we need to use the gong.

[144:56.89]Oh, wait, wait.
[144:57.35]Somebody has an ice shield.
[144:58.27]I want to see what it does.
[145:01.28]Counteracts flame attacks.
[145:02.58]Nice.
[145:03.58]Should I give...
[145:26.29]Is there any reason why you're starting at midnight EU?
[145:29.87]Because I live in the United States of America.
[145:32.53]On the west coast.
[145:33.55]All the way at the end.
[145:48.92]You live in Alaska?
[145:49.82]That's not the end.
[145:50.58]That's up in Canada.
[145:51.68]We just stole it one day.
[145:52.39]Okay, ready?
[145:53.79]It's time to do it?

[148:01.31]Okay?
[148:02.27]This core is like 12 gigahertz.
[148:06.67]But it can only do one task.
[148:08.53]Put him down.
[148:25.91]You guys got like dual and quad cores.
[148:29.80]Not me.
[148:33.20]I got one fucking core that just has a lot of computational power.
[148:37.96]And that's it.
[148:44.79]Streamer has a pre-built brain.
[148:48.73]Don't.
[149:15.36]Ah, that's fucking hilarious.
[149:23.54]Oops, I screwed it up!

[196:47.67]Why does it get so crusty?
[196:52.53]I don't know.
[196:53.13]It just kind of does.
[196:54.01]It just does, doesn't it?
[197:01.19]Crust is real.
[197:02.03]When you change menus.
[197:04.21]Don't ask me why.
[197:04.77]Okay.
[197:13.58]I'm going to make it a Yaripan.

[198:20.05]Okay.
[198:24.45]Okay.
[198:25.97]Let's go.
[198:36.92]Nothing like a good old friendship sword.
[198:41.48]Look out for that cloud monster.
[198:47.07]Okay.
[198:50.66]Can we pick him up?
[198:55.30]You lousy Patapons.
[198:59.24]Get in.
[199:04.88]What the hell is that?
[199:06.24]Is that it over there?
[199:11.53]Kill it!
[199:11.91]Whoa.
[199:19.96]Uh... What the fuck?
[199:24.82]Can we back up?
[199:27.58]Holy shit.
[199:32.06]The only spell.
[199:34.77]Right?
[199:35.43]Or...
[199:53.71]That was a good hit.
[199:59.60]Alright, now block.
[200:11.69]Got it.
[200:12.15]Again.
[200:12.71]Alright, again.
[200:15.95]I've been listening to it for hours now.
[200:22.61]Yeah, me too.
[200:24.53]Is there a way to mute their voices?
[200:38.44]I don't think so.
[200:39.28]What?
[200:39.44]That's like a secret.
[200:40.22]Kill it!
[200:54.90]Forward and then... Get it before it disappears!
[201:02.02]Get in there!
[201:04.26]No!
[201:05.22]Shit!
[201:06.28]Are they blocking?
[201:14.14]Yeah, I... What's going on?
[201:37.45]Imagine wanting to mute Patapon, cope out her clips.
[201:39.97]Alright, let's go.
[202:09.33]Just pick it up.
[202:10.18]I'm muted?
[202:10.66]I'm not muted!
[202:38.05]I have not... I can see the indicator.
[203:02.95]Dumb screamer, can't even unmute.
[203:06.06]Alright, now a five minute break from reading chat.
[203:09.16]I think that sounds good.
[203:26.71]No, Patropons, no.
[203:30.06]Get that thing.
[203:33.82]I got to think it's like a staff.
[203:38.23]Got a staff.
[203:39.55]He's in the way.
[203:43.45]Got it.
[203:43.85]I can't walk by him.
[203:45.57]I can't walk by him.
[204:02.75]I can't move by him.
[204:05.51]I got an egg.
[204:36.12]my dps was too low yeah alright ah yeah yeah dash ah yeah yeah dash yeah yeah
[205:07.34]Was that your Ayaya security number?
[205:14.70]Dude, why the hell would you put that in here?
[205:16.25]What's wrong with you?
[205:16.85]Patapons like to stay clean, so they'll run from the smelly game.
[205:24.01]If they pass under an enemy bird, the bird might drop a poo-poo on them, which will make any Patapon upset.
[205:29.86]Make sure to keep them clean.
[205:39.24]Oh, fuck!
[205:39.60]What the fuck are you talking about?
[205:41.78]Okay.
[205:42.08]Um, should I do one of the egg thing again?
[206:13.99]Cintura egg one.
[206:15.17]Hmm.
[206:15.71]Maybe I should just do... I'll do Cintura one.
[206:30.98]So who are these little guys?
[206:32.76]Did I just get them?
[206:33.98]This is my hero.
[206:45.54]Oh, what?
[206:46.08]Who the fuck is this?
[206:50.66]Formation.
[206:53.91]He appears on horseback, riding with none.
[206:55.65]His form must be that of a true warrior.
[207:01.14]Oh, that's cool.
[207:05.40]Does he always have to be in the front?
[207:16.59]Do it solo.
[207:17.41]Oh, they're supposed to be... Okay.
[207:22.31]Let's just go kill this thing.
[207:24.45]This is for multiplayer?
[207:27.81]How would multiplayer work in this game?
[207:34.06]You all have to do it at the same time?
[207:47.10]Oh, I forgot
[208:19.30]Not on the easy mode anymore.
[208:21.31]Before inputs don't work.
[208:23.23]Oh god.

[215:23.77]What do you want me to say?
[215:24.85]Yes, I was responsible, and when BTC reached that $20,000, I was like, yep, it's time to sell it here, and this is a good idea, and I'm going to sell it.
[215:36.41]It went down.
[215:37.39]Just keep it.
[215:37.93]It's going to be the new paradigm.
[215:40.31]It's $14,000.
[215:41.27]Just hold on to it.
[215:42.83]We're going to get a big rally here.
[215:44.83]It's $8,000.
[215:46.28]I'm telling you, this is going to be the new technology everybody's going to use.
[215:55.30]What do you want me to say?
[215:55.92]You want me to say, oh, I'm responsible and I took profits when I should have.
[216:03.30]Papaya.
[216:08.21]Papaya.
[216:11.27]Papaya.

[216:26.63]Ooh!
[216:27.17]Level 3.
[216:27.95]Yup.
[216:34.17]He fell for a get-rich-quick scheme.
[216:42.74]No, I didn't.
[216:44.32]Because it's still, like, cryptographic technology.
[216:48.44]It's, like, a good technology.
[216:49.86]It's going to do some good things eventually here.
[216:51.58]Alright.
[216:52.62]Alright.
[216:54.92]everybody knows that come on cryptographic techno stuff keep telling yourself that I don't have to keep telling myself that even if it's not money it'll you know there'll be a use for it it'll be the thing that communicates in your car to tell it to like turn its engine on and like to be careful get on a self-driving ai blockchain car I don't know
[217:23.95]Can I have this?
[217:24.39]Can I have a little bit of hope, please?
[217:34.12]I think I'm out of money.
[217:39.84]Self-driving blockchain car would take.
[217:43.33]You'd be like, okay, time to take a turn signal.
[217:45.55]Alright, hold on.
[217:46.57]About to take a left.
[217:48.03]First, let me download every single left that's ever been taken by every single other car.
[217:55.97]Okay, almost got it.
[218:03.59]Okay, now it's time to put my left on the next one.
[218:06.99]Oh!
[218:13.74]Okay, I'm playing the game
[218:33.84]I've made thousands of dollars in crypto in the last month alone.
[218:37.10]I'm really happy for you.
[218:39.45]That's great.
[218:40.61]That's fucking awesome.
[218:41.83]I'm really happy to hear that.
[218:44.19]It's gonna do something.
[218:45.59]Look, it's like a new technology.
[218:48.13]Fucking pets.com came out and nobody gives a shit anymore.
[218:51.85]There'll be an Amazon of the crypto world.
[218:56.29]There'll be a few of them probably.
[218:57.73]I don't know.
[218:58.33]I'm just optimistic, okay?
[218:59.71]And I'm glad you're making some money.
[219:03.99]That's cool.
[219:04.59]Whatever.
[219:04.97]It's sure it is.
[219:05.85]Of course it is.
[219:06.31]What do you want me to pretend?
[219:07.19]He got absolutely bugged.
[219:27.65]He's delirious.
[219:31.91]How much money did you lose?
[219:35.98]Um, not enough to be sad, but enough to be annoyed.
[219:38.42]Let's just put it that way.
[219:44.97]Attack!
[219:56.11]A hundred pay?
[219:58.71]If you think a slight annoyance would be from a hundred thousand dollars in losses.
[220:04.55]Um...
[220:07.67]How much money do you think I have?
[220:10.87]He's bragging about being a millionaire again.
[220:29.03]What was that face?
[220:31.77]Dude, you're a millionaire.
[220:34.75]I'm gonna hiss into the mic.
[220:36.11]I'm gonna hiss into the mic.
[221:00.03]Oh, by the way, I got all the Easy Bake Oven stuff.
[221:03.51]This stuff is gonna be disgusting.
[221:07.64]I saw the packet for the pizza.
[221:10.66]I don't want to eat this pizza.
[221:12.04]It's gonna be fucking revolting.
[221:31.77]Imagine making a pizza out of a powdered packet.
[221:34.91]That's what it is.
[221:40.67]Guys, even the Lunchables.
[221:43.59]Lunchables pizzas are cold and they're weird.
[221:46.83]They don't come out of like a powdered pouch.
[221:52.87]It's not, no, I don't even think it's flour.
[221:54.43]It's some alien liquid.
[221:56.17]I don't know.
[221:59.15]Wait.
[222:07.35]Get that sword!
[222:08.73]Get that sword.
[222:09.95]Somebody touch it.
[222:11.31]Nice.
[222:11.67]Thunder sword.
[222:19.49]Pog.
[222:19.78]Thunder sword.
[222:22.02]Huge pog moment.
[222:36.42]Keep pressing.
[222:37.22]What are those things?
[222:39.57]Is she shooting?
[222:43.53]Blocking.
[223:09.46]Someone just came in and said Veto.
[223:13.04]You're about four hours too late.
[223:17.06]Annihilate.
[224:01.25]Wait, that's supplying that... No, that's not scamming.
[224:03.91]These aren't... Air restoration?
[224:13.58]That shit actually works.
[224:17.58]That that stuff works if you do the surgery or whatever it is.
[224:25.13]And nobody can tell it's not my real hair.
[224:33.11]Nobody can tell it's not my real hair.
[224:35.91]Because I had a video of me in a pool.
[224:39.09]Coming up from under the water.
[224:41.84]And my hair goes back.
[224:42.94]Just look at it.
[224:57.66]And I look into the camera and I go, it's my real hair!
[225:00.70]And I pretend to yank it.
[225:02.54]And you can clearly tell that I'm not putting any pressure at all on it.
[225:07.58]I'm just like, I'm doing like a pantomime that I'm pulling.
[225:13.57]Why the fuck would I want to like compromise this hair?
[225:17.27]For a TV commercial that I probably got paid like $300 to be in.
[225:28.53]procedure was like 16 grand.
[225:29.77]Why would I compromise this?
[225:38.23]What are they saying?
[225:46.79]Oh, but this shit works apparently.
[225:48.07]It works.
[225:50.69]This shit actually works.
[225:51.47]Quiet.
[226:03.77]Alright, get in.
[226:07.31]Alright, move closer.
[226:40.69]Show no mercy.
[226:42.39]Alright, now he can hinge.
[226:51.30]Removing my brain cells.
[227:06.18]Because of the sounds and the colors.
[227:09.90]Pressing the same sequence of buttons over and over again.
[227:17.81]Atapon fatigue?
[227:20.35]Is that like gamer fatigue?
[227:23.83]I know what that is.
[227:37.69]You puny Patapons, I'm gonna rock you!
[227:39.34]Ooh, he dropped something.
[227:40.76]Go full- Get these items!
[227:44.68]Can I get the items?
[227:46.08]How do I get the items?
[227:49.10]It's like a yellow item, I can't get it.
[228:22.84]Why do I care about lore when there's items on the ground?
[228:26.79]The Brady Grinner.
[228:51.05]Okay, I want to see the new thunder bow.
[228:52.49]Cool.
[228:52.61]Generic ass fucking story.
[229:29.07]I'm like this game a lot don't you know I say that I said the same thing I gotta be careful because I did that with Mario Sunshine and I think I'm I gotta stop doing that I gotta stop like like shit posting on my own stream I've done it a couple times today like I'm gonna stop shit posting on this on my own account
[229:59.10]I don't like this.
[230:00.02]Why?
[230:01.20]Whoa, look at that hair!
[230:15.93]Good.
[230:16.63]Go, go.
[230:21.35]More archers I can make.

[230:27.17]There's nothing here.
[230:30.52]There's nothing here.
[230:32.43]Go left.

[230:46.09]Call the guy with the hair.
[231:07.86]What is going on?
[231:10.68]There'll be something to the left soon.
[231:13.56]Okay.

[231:40.94]Ooh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[231:43.93]What does that mean?
[232:05.54]Thunder Sword.
[232:06.32]A magical sword that harnesses the power of thunder.
[232:10.44]It can deal critical staggers and knockbacks as well as set fires.
[232:14.15]I'm gonna have to give that to the guy in front.
[232:24.75]Thunder Bow, right?

[233:13.27]Thunder sword.
[233:13.93]Friendship helm.
[233:18.45]Steel shield.
[233:19.81]Ice shield.

[234:06.99]Putting your teeth together and... What's better, pears or peaches?
[234:14.43]Neither of them.
[234:15.47]Throw them both in the trash and buy nectarines instead.
[234:36.26]I actually think they can really cross the snow field.
[234:38.28]No, I mean like theoretically throw them away.
[234:47.92]Actually throw them away.
[234:54.70]Look at that big sword.
[235:09.34]Anime.
[235:09.88]Darn these Pataphons.
[235:11.57]Aiming.
[235:12.91]I think I had a chance to leave.
[235:23.83]This isn't human.
[235:25.95]Those Pataphons are monsters.
[235:40.16]You're killing them.
[236:09.52]Get that flame!
[236:10.76]Not gonna get that flame.
[236:24.99]Throw.
[236:25.29]Nice throw.
[236:29.69]Rain, dude.
[236:30.67]Alright, I got it.
[236:35.40]That's a migraine scream.
[236:36.90]We're probably gonna be getting those to the end soon.
[236:39.99]This is kind of turning into a migraine scream, isn't it?
[236:42.79]Is this the rain ritual?
[237:08.76]He actually hates this game.
[237:10.50]No, I don't.
[237:15.54]Games are on the agenda.
[237:18.60]Well, No More Heroes 2 is on single-core brain.
[237:36.68]Alright, get those coins.
[237:40.18]Yeah, No More Heroes 2 is going to be on Monday.
[238:02.51]Or was it with Daisy?
[238:03.17]I don't know Daisy.
[238:12.58]And then we'll do Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[238:17.64]The idea that we do No More Heroes 2.
[238:21.24]And that takes us back two streams.
[238:25.06]And then we do Resident Evil 3.
[238:27.14]Can you hear me?
[238:28.93]Oh, sorry.
[238:31.95]No More Heroes 2, Monday, Tuesday.
[238:33.89]And then the idea is then to get that sword.
[238:40.92]And then do Resident Evil 3.
[238:45.98]On Wednesday, Thursday.
[238:49.15]If it takes that long.
[238:51.55]Resident Evil 3 takes one day, like for instance on Wednesday.
[238:54.41]And we'll play something else on Thursday.
[239:04.20]It might take one day.
[239:12.98]Shit.
[239:17.06]When's Easy Bake?
[239:22.12]Easy Bake Oven Stream and the Green Screen DLC for free stream.
[239:26.56]It'll be back-to-back on May 15th and 16th.
[239:34.58]back-to-back.
[239:39.04]The Easy Bake Oven stream will be probably Friday.
[239:42.97]And the Green Screen DLC will be on Saturday.
[239:54.27]Am I just permanently frozen here?
[239:59.41]Just move!
[240:00.73]Come on, guys!
[240:19.43]Alright, I got it.
[240:29.96]When are you going to do a cringe stream?
[240:34.78]Somebody could probably argue that that's every single one.
[240:38.22]I mean, I'm sure there's somebody that would be watching this like, I don't like that.
[240:42.15]I mean... Oh, I can't argue with that.
[240:53.97]Alright, just kill him!
[240:55.25]I'm just gonna do a defending only.
[241:09.35]The wind's too strong.
[241:18.47]Your hero makes you unkillable.
[241:21.72]Why would I ever- that's awesome.
[241:39.47]You should do a cringe-only stream.
[241:42.45]You mean just desperately try to be as horrible as possible?
[241:50.68]Headache stream.
[241:52.92]Hold on.
[241:53.32]I'm trying to get after this.
[242:02.60]You already do that.
[242:06.27]Whatever.
[242:08.58]This is a torture stream?
[242:10.22]What?
[242:10.52]This game's fun.
[242:13.30]It's just... I mean, just turn... I know you're hearing... La la la!
[242:17.55]La la la!
[242:32.48]Quit the mission and go left.
[242:33.56]I'm about to beat the mission.
[242:37.40]Remember, who's better, Ace of Base or the 90s Beach Boys?
[242:43.32]Ace of Base.
[242:56.29]Ace of Base is the ones that... I saw the sign, and it opened up my eyes.
[243:02.01]I saw the sign.
[243:03.11]Is that Ace of Base?
[243:25.21]Get that pot.
[243:26.09]Get that pot.
[243:27.09]I'm out of pots, dude.
[243:29.31]I'm out of pots.
[243:30.75]I'm potting.
[243:33.03]I'm potting.
[243:42.12]That's the cringe content I'm looking for.
[243:44.46]That's the real cringe content.
[243:59.01]don't say that there it is that was in my mind the hero makes you take no damage this is great actually
[244:47.80]Viewers are plummeting.
[244:50.78]I think that already happened.
[244:53.56]Back when I was arguing with you guys about the input delay.
[244:59.37]And thousands of people were just like, I'm fucking out of here.
[245:02.51]I'm done with this one. ...
[245:20.69]We're the true fans.
[245:29.81]I feel like I'm fighting the same three people here for 15 straight minutes.
[245:38.79]We stayed for the input delay stream.
[245:41.29]Oh, mega lull.
[245:44.67]I still had fun.
[245:45.55]I mean, this game is fun.
[245:52.24]There's the ice fortress, finally.
[246:06.49]I like the RPG elements.
[246:21.72]This is not the final boss.
[246:23.00]No way.
[246:28.62]I need more rain.
[246:33.99]Can I get these guys closer?
[246:35.69]Get in closer.
[246:36.89]Closer.
[246:37.29]Alright, now move in.
[246:52.11]This game is 25 hours long.
[246:55.79]Plenty of content.
[246:56.45]Maybe I'm not strong enough.
[247:08.15]Maybe I was supposed to grind.
[247:10.36]They definitely use this kind of stuff in Guantanamo.
[247:31.79]to sit here and play this, but it's not, you guys are overreacting.
[247:52.33]Come on!
[247:59.64]It's like my alarm clock won't turn off.
[248:07.61]It's... Don't worry.
[248:18.54]Don't make me laugh right now.
[248:23.52]I did it!
[248:32.92]kill kill kill kill yeah hey do a game mute sound joke come on relax relax I don't have to start banning people remember wave my finger and you're gone
[249:17.38]I did it.
[249:17.72]I say the word, you're out of here.
[249:23.34]Don't ever forget that.
[249:24.12]Nice.
[249:38.79]Okay, now follow the guy that go to the left, right?
[249:59.55]well I never told you to turn the volume up all the way and put your eyes so the wet part of your eyes is touching your monitor I didn't tell you to do that left
[250:15.18]One, two, three.
[250:15.82]One, two, three.
[250:16.26]Oh, the mighty Jerry.
[250:18.36]What a delight.
[250:18.78]I am to meet you.
[250:19.68]I'm fabulous.
[250:20.78]I'm the fabulous dance instructor.
[250:22.70]Shiraba Yapon, master of the disco, fox, rapoka, and waltz.
[250:26.60]My mission is in life to create the most fabulous dancers.
[250:30.02]My beloved pupils are practicing right here.
[250:32.06]I'll be able to first do the training.
[250:33.04]My name is Shiraba Yapon, master of the disco.
[250:35.74]I'll be my own teacher.
[250:36.50]Okay?
[250:36.76]Alright, let's do it.
[250:44.31]Yes, I guess.
[250:45.61]Cafeteria meals.
[250:46.49]Okay, meat.
[250:48.82]Here, take a walnut.
[250:50.12]I'll take one of these.
[250:51.82]What should I give?
[250:52.60]What do I give?
[250:54.40]What do I give?
[250:55.82]A map?
[251:01.17]Stick?
[251:03.55]Give a wooden branch?
[251:18.17]There's a rich person's doorbell.
[251:20.52]I may not be too smart, but I'll do the best I can.
[251:32.64]Please teach me to dance.
[251:33.49]Great, Jerry.
[251:39.65]Have you danced to this song before?
[251:41.23]No.
[251:45.15]What button is that?
[251:47.54]The important notes scroll across the screen.
[251:52.20]When a note gets there, press O. As long as we keep on dancing, the notes will keep on passing.
[252:05.17]When you see a whole bunch of notes coming through, press the circle button as many times as you can.
[252:09.23]Go nuts.
[252:09.43]Okay.
[252:16.10]Four times you press it, the more ka-ching that'll play.
[252:17.85]Now, instructor, I'm ready to begin.
[252:19.73]If you press O in time for the notes, Churaba Yapon will wave his baton.
[252:28.11]This will help you dance along.
[252:29.11]It's more fun than the actual game.
[252:45.71]the blob 2 waiting room
[253:17.03]Understood.
[253:17.51]Okay.
[253:21.48]How about level two?
[253:24.32]Level one.
[253:25.30]Is this level correct?
[253:26.10]That was fun.
[253:28.00]Into the stream voice.
[253:37.08]He sounds like you.
[253:37.96]He does not sound like you.
[253:41.92]Into the stream voice.
[253:49.59]How can you hate this game and then play Gacha Force for 15 hours with it's one song?
[253:53.49]I didn't- I never told you I hated this game.
[253:56.65]You are implanting that.
[253:59.67]That's not- I never said that.
[254:00.95]I didn't say that.
[254:01.97]Oh, left again?
[254:13.17]What's a better Olympic sport term, a trampoline or the ribbon dancing?
[254:15.55]The ribbon dancing is the best sport in the Olympics completely.
[254:20.49]It's just the coolest thing.
[254:21.45]I mean, trampoline's cool, but ribbon dancing is fucking way cooler.
[254:25.03]Go to the tree.
[254:28.99]What do you want?
[254:32.44]You missed it.
[254:33.52]What the fuck?
[254:36.20]Huh?
[254:36.76]Like, there's nothing here.
[254:42.73]Okay.
[254:43.75]Gonna call it here.
[254:52.67]We're gonna hang out.
[254:53.25]For the bits.
[254:54.55]We'll chill for like, probably like an hour.
[254:55.61]Okay.
[255:02.61]He hates it.
[255:03.18]No, he doesn't.
[255:05.14]Just trying to adhere to his schedule.
[255:10.62]What would you give for a grade?
[255:14.91]7 out of 10?
[255:21.84]He just decided to torture his chat today.
[255:24.24]I can't, I don't, I think it's cool.
[255:31.91]I think it's cute.
[255:32.47]I think it's fun.
[255:32.99]I think there's a lot of depth.
[255:39.43]He will never beat Groyo Groyo.
[255:45.12]A strong seven?
[255:49.00]Um... It's very, very strong.
[255:57.99]I'm so glad that Jerma hates chat.
[256:02.74]Why would you be glad about something that's not even true?
[256:06.53]No, I can't give something a grade that I played for like four hours.
[256:11.55]It was like a 25-hour game, and I played it for like four or five hours to check it out and see if I liked it.
[256:15.94]I liked it.
[256:20.06]I can't be like, ah, it was an A+.
[256:22.12]I don't know.
[256:23.00]It could be.
[256:23.38]What would you rate us?
[256:31.40]That changes between Monday and Friday.
[256:43.09]Unlike Tuesday, maybe.
[256:44.57]Sometimes, maybe you guys could be a 6.
[256:48.33]Unlike Thursdays, you might be a 9.
[256:52.70]Saturday?
[256:53.98]Oh, that's where the 5s come out.
[256:55.70]Sunday?
[256:56.04]That's where the 5s come out.
[256:57.94]Monday?
[256:58.84]5s come out.
[257:00.18]Tuesday?
[257:00.64]Usually the 6s come out.
[257:01.96]Wednesday?
[257:02.28]Usually the 8s or the 9s.
[257:03.82]Thursday?
[257:04.20]Probably like the 6s.
[257:08.72]Wait, what's today?
[257:10.80]I didn't give a date.
[257:11.56]Oh, I didn't give a grade for Thursday.
[257:16.69]Thursday.
[257:21.01]Not you guys.
[257:21.71]No, you guys are great.
[257:24.66]I'm fucking kidding.
[257:30.46]Relax.
[257:32.68]Nah.
[257:33.85]You guys are always a fucking... At least 8.5.
[257:35.27]At least a 9.
[257:35.73]The reason why you don't get a 10.
[257:39.03]Because...
[257:42.48]Somebody says I have big zits on my forehead.
[257:44.84]If I turn my facecam on, that brings you all down.
[257:48.49]It brings you all down to a fucking nine.
[257:57.95]If everybody in the room got an A on their test, and two people get an F... Sorry, but the collective class was like a B+.
[258:08.40]That's just how it works.
[258:16.90]Oh no, I got an F. Out of 4,000 students... No, I'm saying if you got like a... That wouldn't even like move the needle.
[258:30.21]If you had like 4,000 A's and like two F's... They wouldn't even affect the grade.
[258:40.39]You can hear the Bogd in his voice.
[258:42.13]Nah, I'll see you guys on Monday.
[258:46.10]I'm going to do No More Heroes.
[258:48.38]We're going to do Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[258:50.72]And then... We're going to do another Community Content Night.
[259:00.74]Because I want to catch it up.
[259:03.06]We'll do another Community Content Night probably on... Somewhere...
[259:11.53]Let's see.
[259:14.16]You know what?
[259:15.00]This makes perfect sense.
[259:16.20]You ready?
[259:18.38]We're going to do... It'll end up being Thursday the 14th.
[259:23.08]Because that's... That's like perfect timing.
[259:28.51]Because then it's Thursday the 14th will be community content night.
[259:31.99]Friday will be Easy Bay Goven.
[259:33.13]And then Saturday will be DLC for free green screens.
[259:39.35]So in like two weeks from now.
[259:41.69]Exactly.
[259:45.77]But I'll see you Monday.
[259:48.43]We're going to start and complete No More Heroes 2 and then we're going to start and complete Resident Evil 3.
[259:53.80]And then if we still have time on Thursday, if I don't beat it on Thursday or on Wednesday, we will do something else.
[260:03.47]That sounds like a good plan to me.
[260:09.37]But we'll see you soon.
[260:10.55]Thanks for watching.
[260:11.15]Thanks for spending your last week.
[260:14.19]Thanks for spending your middle of your week with me.
[260:17.31]Or the beginning of your week until now.
[260:19.37]Yeah.
[260:19.93]Thanks for spending it with me.
[260:21.05]We had fun.
[260:25.86]You're definitely going to beat it in one stream.
[260:27.28]Even these weak-ass short streams.
[260:29.60]The game... Weak-ass short stream.
[260:36.91]I'm trying to get healthy.
[260:38.03]God damn it.
[260:47.94]This was good to hear, yeah.
[260:54.37]You better do another 12-hour stream someday.
[260:56.17]That's never gonna happen.
[260:56.93]Stop smoking.
[261:05.39]I don't smoke.
[261:11.45]He got soft.
[261:15.29]Whatever it is, he got something.
[261:19.59]Whatever weird bone disease I have, I got it.
[261:22.81]I don't know, it just happened.
[261:25.61]Shit happens.
[261:31.14]Oh, we'll see you on Monday.
[261:35.88]He's got bonitis.
[261:36.90]Pretzel bones?
[261:44.40]It must be from all the donkey donuts.
[261:49.45]You're gonna do no more streaming on weekends.
[261:52.13]Um, no, that's just kind of how it this is.
[262:00.36]I mean, Friday and Saturday.
[262:03.44]We have a plan for Thursday, Friday, Saturday for the month.
[262:09.02]It's just how it plays out, you know, four days in a row, like three days, four days, three days, five days is kind of how it just plays out with the new schedule I want to try.
[262:22.06]Tweet about it so you don't forget it.
[262:33.23]Do a facecam.
[262:33.85]You're too self-conscious.
[262:34.69]I already did.
[262:37.59]He's got a Jerm.
[262:38.63]I'm sorry.
[262:39.01]The game sucks.
[262:39.71]Why is everybody saying that?
[262:42.86]No, it's because I did the stupid comedy thing where I was like, this fucking game's stupid.
[262:47.51]This fucking goddamn fucking game sucks.
[262:49.05]This game's fucking terrible.
[262:50.67]I'm telling you, I've got to stop doing that.
[262:53.25]I have to stop shitposting on my own stream.
[262:55.81]I've got to stop doing that.
[262:56.64]I'm not doing that anymore.
[263:06.84]No more jokes.
[263:11.77]Alright, let's do the bits.
[263:14.07]See you Monday.
[263:19.80]Stop denying the fact that you wanted to stab your thumbs through those juicy Patapon eyes and watch them squirm Omega Lull.
[263:29.96]That's not an Omega Lull scenario.
[263:36.24]That's a, uh...
[263:40.67]That's a MonkaS scenario.
[263:44.83]That's an actual Omega Psycho.
[263:47.21]Alright, I'll see you Monday.
[263:49.85]Let's do the bits.
[263:50.35]We have 250 from Pigeon.
[263:51.19]Just kidding.
[263:52.83]That's what I got.
[263:53.41]I, uh...
[264:07.39]I promise you one day that'll happen.
[264:09.54]Before I stop streaming forever, whenever that date is, there will be a full 20-plus person in full costume marching band on this stream.
[264:22.24]I promise.
[264:23.34]No good audio either, just the regular mic.
[264:26.10]I promise.
[264:27.21]I fucking promise it's going to happen.
[264:28.35]It has to.
[264:32.64]Hey, C4G, thanks for the $2.50.
[264:34.16]What's the status on the Resident Evil 3 stream?
[264:37.17]There you go.
[264:38.01]I hope you're here.
[264:41.31]Talked about it.
[264:42.41]It's going to be happening next week.
[264:44.14]On Wednesday.
[264:47.48]Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday.
[264:48.62]Should be fun.
[264:55.53]Hey, Lando Bando, thanks for the $2.50.
[264:57.03]Hey there, Big J. You've inspired so many of my creative endeavors.
[264:59.81]So now I'm working on a Jerma mockumentary where I tour around Boston to important places, such as the Dunkey Donuts, where you were born as you chased me.
[265:14.32]Also, you should play Blood Bowl 2.
[265:15.90]It's kind of like the League, but all the... Well, kind of like Blitz the League, but all the stupidity has been brought up to 11.
[265:21.87]Helicopters crash, fantasy races, and straight up killing the other team.
[265:26.93]Is that really?
[265:29.85]What?
[265:30.05]I'm going to have to look into that.
[265:36.28]At least it seems fun.
[265:38.54]Thanks to the 250 and... Here comes a mockumentary.
[265:43.38]SticksRenegade, thanks for $2.50.
[265:44.34]Hey there.
[265:46.50]Hey, Jerry.
[265:47.95]Remember, if you cannot play Jackie Chan's Stuntmaster within 10 years, you automatically admit that Willy Wonka 2005 is a better Wonka movie.
[265:54.69]Jeremiah Grin.
[265:55.37]That's fine.
[265:59.27]Not gonna happen.
[266:02.15]XNX, thanks for the $2.50.
[266:03.85]When's Toontown?
[266:04.80]It'll probably happen at the end of May.
[266:09.18]I already guessed.
[266:15.70]Here's a few pics to give you an idea.
[266:17.58]Um...
[266:49.81]not I mean did people have like grad people had graduation parties where yeah it would be like oh like we graduated let's hang out but also you have to remember um he's talking about going out and like having drinks uh the drinking age in the United States is 21. so you can't you can't like go out and get drinks and have get drinks when you're 17 18 19.
[267:17.40]drinking age is 21 so it was more of a grill food outside and have people have your friends and family come over and give you cards with like $20 bills in them more so how that happened so not necessarily the same thing
[267:44.97]what is um I'm just just out of curiosity what is the drinking age in Finland what's like the the legal drinking age in Finland is it 18 16 18 probably 18. a lot of the european countries are somewhere what 18 and some of them even lower than that right
[268:14.68]18, 20 for alcohol, over 21%.
[268:16.27]Huh.
[268:16.59]Here in Denmark, it's 15.
[268:19.39]Germany is 16.
[268:20.01]16 in Germany, yeah.
[268:30.32]So it's weird as an American.
[268:34.40]It's so weird to think about that.
[268:37.05]At like 16, you could like legally drink alcohol.
[268:41.55]That's like such a foreign concept to me.
[268:48.07]Wow.
[268:48.75]What?
[268:49.53]No, you can't.
[268:51.77]You can't do that.
[268:53.34]You're not 21, are you?
[268:54.66]How old are you?
[268:56.64]It's interesting.
[269:01.99]People drink anyway, don't be ridiculous.
[269:05.13]Oh, I'm talking about in a... In a legal sense.
[269:17.12]Like, you can't go into the grocery store, guys, at 16 and buy, like, beer.
[269:25.82]You can in Germany.
[269:26.76]Like, that's... It's just so different.
[269:41.21]Can't go and do it, period.
[269:43.49]Well, it depends on where you are.
[269:50.87]Yeah, but, um, we don't... No, that's... That's not something that we really do.
[269:57.46]At least I didn't do it.
[270:00.12]Just because it was... It was more like a family get-together than it was, like, have, like, a big party with your friends.
[270:11.74]Crazy that we can draft someone but not let them drink.
[270:17.08]Yeah, where did the... Okay, I know it's like the age of being knighted, right?
[270:24.51]Isn't it 21?
[270:26.01]Is that even real?
[270:27.19]Or is that just like a fake article I read one day?
[270:31.11]Wasn't it like, oh, the knights got knighted at 21 or something?
[270:35.08]That's fake?
[270:35.48]Why is it 21?
[270:42.25]That's an anime plot.
[270:49.93]Anime laws!
[270:59.24]Uh, but... Like, you're considered an illegal adult.
[271:06.72]You're an adult at 18.
[271:10.99]then you're an adult you can but no then now like cigarettes are now moving to 21 all over the place too a lot of like to buy cigarettes 21. which it was it's been it was 18 for decades and decades
[271:41.95]No, no, I meant you celebrate May Day, not graduation day from high school.
[271:47.68]Um, no, that's not really a thing here.
[271:52.82]Most of the, I mean, most of the holidays that are in the summer, like this late spring and in the summer, are you talking about, I mean, this, um, it's May Day, May Day.
[272:05.71]Like Memorial Day, right?
[272:07.67]Memorial Day, or the July.
[272:09.91]There's a bunch of things that we do.
[272:20.69]July 4th, yeah.
[272:25.70]But not in particular May Day, no.
[272:30.84]I wanted to say Zyxia again gave 100 community subs, which is fucking crazy.
[272:35.93]It's just so many subs to give it in one second.
[272:40.85]I really hope you can afford it.
[272:42.17]That's a lot of money to give somebody.
[272:45.03]Ever.
[272:46.87]Thank you, Zyxia.
[272:49.93]Do a drunk stream, please.
[272:51.28]I just did.
[272:51.84]I just did like four or five days ago.
[273:05.22]Hey, nope, thanks for the 500 bits.
[273:08.36]Yo, Jumbo, I just wanted to say thanks for streaming gotcha farts the last few days.
[273:12.56]It helped me fall asleep and fix my sleeping schedule.
[273:14.65]Smiley face, no space.
[273:16.69]Thank you.
[273:17.79]Hey, Fishies, thanks for $5.
[273:23.18]Thanks for the five dollars.
[273:29.90]Thanks for donating.
[273:32.58]I feel like you deserve more than just a sub.
[273:34.92]I want to make sure how you know how much all of us in our community appreciate what you do for us.
[273:38.98]No matter what game you play or how long you're online, your streams always make me smile.
[273:42.23]I just want to say thank you for being you and never change.
[273:48.57]I appreciate that.
[273:51.41]But
[273:53.74]A sub is... You're kind of paying for it.
[273:59.80]Already, you know what I mean?
[274:00.97]Like, if you are subbed to the channel... You know, you talk about that... That's like $5 a month.
[274:09.79]You are already contributing.
[274:11.11]Like, that's already more than I could ever ask anybody to do.
[274:15.30]So, if you've subbed to the channel, you don't... You don't feel like you have to... Oh, no, I have to give more.
[274:23.67]You don't have to.
[274:29.45]You don't have to give anything.
[274:34.22]Being subbed to the channel and thinking I have to give more money is something I really hope people don't really think they have to do.
[274:54.36]You're worth donating to.
[274:56.14]If you think that, then that's, that's for you to decide.
[275:04.09]But I've all, I've, I've, I toyed with the idea.
[275:11.71]And, I mean, this, this is, this is just all hypotheticals.
[275:15.25]And all, um, just thought project in quotes.
[275:20.30]Those of you that remember from a while ago, I never had a donation link.
[275:24.70]I never had one.
[275:25.78]It was always something that I was like, I don't really want to do that.
[275:28.27]Because people sub, you sub.
[275:31.07]You're already paid for it, whatever.
[275:32.99]And when bits came along, it was like, oh, I guess it took me a while to kind of be okay with it.
[275:37.15]And like, want to do it.
[275:41.86]And...
[275:44.73]I think about stuff sometimes.
[275:47.43]What if there was no bits?
[275:49.43]What if you could just sub to this channel?
[275:54.40]Sometimes I think about that.
[276:05.92]Community subs would be insane.
[276:12.52]Oh, I see what you're doing.
[276:35.18]I think about this kind of stuff all the time, where it's like, well, what if you just, like, okay, you just optionally pay $5 a month if you feel like it.
[276:45.75]Like, it's not, oh, I want to give you more money.
[276:48.59]I want to give you, like, $5,000 more.
[276:50.45]Like, essentially, like an optional Netflix subscription.
[277:06.92]Patreon.
[277:09.57]But... And then, well, what happens to stuff like this?
[277:14.19]Is it worth it if you're going to keep streaming?
[277:24.96]Yeah, no, nothing would change.
[277:27.88]It would just be... Like, monetarily speaking...
[277:35.52]subscriptions would be, like, the only form of this channel bringing in, like, money.
[277:44.34]And this is not something I'm saying I'm going to do, but I don't know.
[277:48.72]It's something to think about.
[277:49.52]I don't do Patreon.
[278:01.37]Bot project for the day.
[278:03.92]He's thinking of ways to make less money.
[278:13.65]I mean, that's not... Less money equals less carnivals.
[278:23.59]But that's not even necessarily true.
[278:30.58]Set chat to true fans only mode.
[278:32.41]Less clowns.
[278:33.15]No, you don't.
[278:39.99]Five million.
[278:40.77]He already has too much money.
[278:47.46]But to move on from that, I just something to think about.
[278:50.76]Not happening.
[278:54.52]Don't worry.
[278:55.17]I'm going to keep those bits on.
[278:57.86]At least a little while longer.
[279:00.02]Just a few more.
[279:01.10]That's it.
[279:02.22]Just a couple more of those bits.
[279:06.12]Don't worry.
[279:06.98]Let us pay you.
[279:08.40]Look, but you do.
[279:11.92]You do.
[279:18.54]Like, you don't pay Netflix extra money a month.
[279:23.18]I'm sure they'd take it.
[279:35.08]Who cares about them?
[279:37.46]Yeah, Netflix eats shit.
[279:45.80]You are at Netflix.
[279:46.74]Yeah, but that's what I mean.
[279:47.92]Like, optional.
[279:50.81]Like it is now.
[280:04.97]Netflix doesn't have easy bake oven yeah it's just a thought I'm just I'm just giving hypotheticals and kind of seeing what you guys think about it we can move on it's not happening this is not like by the way next week this bitch will be deleted just want to see what you guys had to say about hey nope thanks for the five dollars yo jumbo just want to say thanks for streaming gachi farts I already read this one

[283:09.05]Does that make you and Kim his skin parents?
[283:17.38]Um.
[283:21.48]No, actually, his name, we call Otto, we call him Mr. Horace Zonto.
[283:32.73]For a couple of particular reasons.
[283:35.13]Uh... Because... He... When in bed... He always sleeps... He never sleeps vertically.
[283:43.15]He always sleeps horizontally.
[283:45.13]And he kind of just gets in the way.
[283:46.32]Like, oh, he's in the way!
[283:47.92]Oh, he's horizontal!
[283:49.14]Oh, come on!
[283:49.50]What are you doing, Mr. Horis-zonto?
[283:52.56]Horis-zonto.
[283:53.34]It's, um... That's what we... What do I mean by vertical?
[283:59.14]Like, he sleeps...
[284:01.84]Like horizontally on the bed.
[284:03.30]Not like vertical like a human.
[284:05.28]So he kind of gets in the way.
[284:07.45]We call him Horus Zonto.
[284:11.71]And you're gonna -2.
[284:14.17]Like a little fun name I give my dog.
[284:19.53]I didn't preface that by going... I got something funny to tell you.
[284:24.26]My dog.
[284:25.08]Right?
[284:25.60]He's a dog.
[284:26.60]That's not even a joke.
[284:30.70]That's not even... That...

[284:36.99]I just like let you, you just like got the looking glass and got to see into my private life.
[284:41.81]And it just throws back in my face.
[284:44.37]Hmm, see if I share anything else with you guys again.

[285:09.78]Local IRS agent, thanks for five more dollars.
[285:12.04]Hey Jeremy, you haven't returned our calls about our findings.
[285:15.71]It's come to our attention from a very reliable source that you were in fact a million dollar streamer.
[285:20.45]We'll be taking our cut of the dough next tax season.
[285:23.91]Hey, thanks for the ten dollars.
[285:34.50]Do I get to deduct that?
[285:37.24]Can I deduct this?
[285:38.90]What would this count as?
[285:46.85]Now I owe ten more dollars.
[285:49.39]One million and ten.
[285:52.03]This fucking millionaire streamer thing.
[286:02.54]Check as a county as in The Bahamas.
[286:05.63]Talking about how bad I'm getting bogged.
[286:08.79]And we think I got a million dollars.
[286:10.59]Hey, Goiki, thanks for the 500 bits.

[288:09.56]A.S.
[288:10.40]Halulco, thanks for the $2.50.
[288:12.54]What is the best pasta shape and why is it Casarices?
[288:17.30]Also, thanks for all the laughs.
[288:18.52]The best pasta is angel hair pasta.
[288:22.83]Angel hair like spaghetti.
[288:23.75]Either that or big sloppy fettuccine noodles.
[288:36.83]Just absolutely just soaking, slathered in sauce.
[288:40.37]Just slathered in fettuccine Alfredo sauce.
[288:43.53]With crispy, sliced up chicken.
[288:45.37]Alright, I'm hungry.
[288:46.19]Bye.
[288:46.85]See you guys on Monday.
[288:55.38]Ugh, olive oil.
[288:56.92]Good olive oil.
[288:57.92]Good one.
[289:07.14]Yeah, that's gonna be good.
[289:10.82]Welcome to BBQPitBoys.com.
[289:13.24]Today we're going to be making some barbecue stuffed hamburgers on the grill.
[289:18.66]Man.
[289:20.97]Gonna be good.
[289:24.53]Oh, you getting hungry or what?
[289:30.77]I watch every single one of their videos.
[289:41.72]For real though, thanks for the $2.50.
[289:43.02]Enough of these baby games.
[289:44.50]Play Mercenaries, Playground of Destruction.
[289:46.50]Holy shit.
[289:51.18]I bought that game like eight months ago.
[289:57.16]And I was gonna play it eight months ago and just be like, hey, that's what we're doing today.
[290:00.98]And I just forgot.
[290:02.07]Alright, I gotta get that down.
[290:05.49]I gotta do that soon.
[290:06.97]That game looks insane.
[290:08.17]Yeah, we'll do that very soon.
[290:11.11]Don't let me forget about that.
[290:11.97]Because I will.
[290:13.17]After about 10 minutes after the stream ends.
[290:15.73]Mercenaries 2.
[290:16.35]Yeah, that's the one.
[290:19.01]Hey, Wembley TTV.
[290:20.23]Thanks for the 250, Germany.
[290:21.07]You know what day it is today?
[290:22.27]It's Thursday.
[290:23.37]It's Thursday.
[290:26.91]For me.
[290:29.49]Gurusei.
[290:30.41]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[290:31.35]Hey, bro.
[290:31.69]I just finished high school tonight.
[290:32.71]Graduating early because of online school.
[290:34.39]Thanks again for all you do.
[290:35.47]Congratulations.
[290:38.33]Close that book and open a new one.
[290:40.09]Open a new one.
[290:42.51]Close that book and open a new one.
[290:43.47]Remember, when you're on that highway, forward.
[290:47.79]There ain't no brakes on the highway.
[290:50.37]No slowing down.
[290:51.71]No going back.
[290:52.97]You don't turn around on the highway.
[290:54.93]Forward.
[290:59.50]Missed the exit?
[291:00.64]Gosh, it's okay.
[291:01.40]Get off of the next one.
[291:07.51]No, seriously though, congrats.
[291:12.23]Thanks for the motivation, Jeremy.
[291:14.25]You're welcome.
[291:18.19]Do you guys think I could make a career out of being that voice on the radio that comes on and sounds like this?
[291:29.76]I guess I could.
[291:30.52]Are you serious?
[291:31.10]You want to talk about like a millionaire?
[291:38.65]Just absolutely throw myself out there and just do 500 of those a day.
[291:43.99]If I do... If I do, like, a 500... These voice radio commercials.
[291:52.70]That's a million dollars right there.
[291:53.96]That's easy.
[291:55.42]Each one is worth... How much?
[291:56.40]Okay, let's do some math.
[292:00.92]Let's say each one is worth, what, like, a few hundred bucks?
[292:02.56]400 bucks?
[292:04.26]300 bucks?
[292:04.48]Let's just say 300 bucks.
[292:05.50]Times 1,000.
[292:10.01]That's $300,000.
[292:10.47]And then take that to the casino and put it all on black.
[292:16.32]That's $600,000.
[292:16.56]Write a children's book.
[292:40.05]If you make a million dollars, you would only gain one-fifth of your net worth, Jerma.
[292:50.00]What do you mean a fifth of?
[292:58.54]Why would I only gain one-fifth?
[293:00.27]What are you talking about?
[293:01.59]What, because of, like, taxes?
[293:16.33]They're claiming you're worth 5 million already.
[293:19.29]Oh.
[293:25.75]No, guys.
[293:28.83]I'm like an idle game.
[293:33.31]If I ever got close to a million dollars, it would just be removed because I would do like a fucking ultra carnival.
[293:43.04]Every time I get close, it would just be constant idle game.
[293:47.22]It would never cross a million.
[293:48.30]It would never happen.
[294:01.69]It admits he's been close.
[294:03.17]No, not even close.
[294:04.27]Not even remotely close.
[294:09.99]Not even halfway there.
[294:11.39]Not even.
[294:11.91]Not even a quarter of the way there.
[294:14.25]Not even.
[294:16.76]Not even.
[294:19.08]Like.
[294:21.70]A tenth of the way there.
[294:24.74]You guys gotta remove some zeros.
[294:36.48]He's a hundred K. Air.
[294:52.65]90k after the whole Beyond Meat thing.
[295:08.84]Are you still in debt from the live rumble?
[295:10.54]Did I ever talk?
[295:12.04]You know what?
[295:12.36]It's been long enough.
[295:14.33]Have I ever talked about where I got the money for the live rumble?
[295:20.29]Did we talk about this yet?
[295:24.56]No, we haven't.
[295:25.86]We have not.
[295:26.46]Have we not talked about it?
[295:37.75]Um... I, uh...
[295:42.73]I drew from my retirement account.
[295:48.28]And liquidated it.
[295:49.24]It's true.
[296:11.05]But, it's okay.
[296:15.72]I take it back.
[296:16.46]He's broke.
[296:17.34]Did you invest in a new one?
[296:19.90]I did.
[296:20.86]I don't know.
[296:21.95]Everything's fine.
[296:22.73]Don't worry.
[296:23.17]I was like, alright, how do I, uh... I'm doing this.
[296:30.99]How much does this cost to do this?
[296:37.70]Oh.
[296:37.96]$10,000 to make this video?
[296:41.20]Oh.
[296:42.52]Let's go.
[296:44.53]How much more do I need?
[296:49.31]And he liquidated the new one for the carnival.
[296:51.85]No.
[297:11.13]Somebody said something.
[297:15.46]This doesn't count as a retirement.
[297:17.96]I don't want to even go there, but what you said is fucking funny.
[297:27.20]No.
[297:30.45]How much was the carnival?
[297:35.23]It hasn't been long enough.
[297:37.23]It hasn't been long enough.
[297:38.09]It has to be like three years for me to say it.
[297:49.09]It's been three years.
[297:53.19]It's been three dog years.
[297:54.42]It was $40,000.
[298:25.35]Been long enough.
[298:32.66]He's broke.
[298:33.44]What were those estimates at again for how much money I have?
[298:45.94]Uh, no.
[298:46.36]I'm gonna be real with you.
[298:47.40]Let's be real.
[298:47.90]Ready?
[298:48.16]Let's get real for a second.
[298:49.56]Um... If I want to do something...
[298:55.91]And I think it will be fun.
[298:58.87]I'm going to do it.
[299:00.95]I'm just gonna fucking do it.
[299:03.47]And if I have, like, the capital... To do it... I'm gonna do it!
[299:14.34]Did you get any profit from the carnival?
[299:16.64]Um... Well, that depends on how you look at that.
[299:20.28]Right?
[299:21.98]Because...
[299:24.21]No jokes.
[299:24.83]No fucking around.
[299:25.53]Let's get serious.
[299:29.29]There's been a huge amount of attention on this channel since then.
[299:32.75]There has been.
[299:33.49]And a lot of new people have showed up.
[299:35.35]A lot of new people are here.
[299:37.69]And the channel has grown a lot since then.
[299:44.68]So...
[299:46.59]I don't know, over the year of... I'm not looking for a return, though.
[299:54.02]I don't look at it that way.
[299:54.98]It's like, was that fun?
[299:57.22]Did people like it?
[299:57.96]And did a bunch of people have a good time?
[299:59.79]And was it worth doing?
[300:00.89]I think it was.
[300:01.53]And...
[300:12.63]I mean, some things, things cost money, and I'm gonna pay for them if I can.
[300:17.49]And that doesn't mean I've used every cent I own.
[300:24.29]Right?
[300:24.59]Like, I would never put myself in any real, like, financial danger.
[300:29.72]I hope you guys understand that.
[300:33.26]There was an opportunity.
[300:36.60]And I took it.
[300:38.05]Do I have a safe savings?
[300:39.23]I do.
[300:39.97]Don't worry.
[300:40.71]I have a retirement account.
[300:42.93]And it's doing fine.
[300:44.97]I have... Don't worry.
[300:50.09]I've been holding on to that one for a while.
[300:53.59]But that's the point, though.
[300:55.10]Who cares?
[300:55.60]Like, I don't... Hey, that's how much money it was.
[301:01.52]What do you guys think about that?
[301:03.62]I don't... Who cares?
[301:04.04]Who cares?
[301:21.84]Like, I don't want to make it about, this is how much it cost, guys.
[301:25.32]So, um, you know.
[301:27.08]That was money that I had to spend.
[301:30.58]And, excuse me, what's going on?
[301:32.42]Um, hello?
[301:32.96]That's why I don't want to talk.
[301:35.26]I don't like to talk about, like, what things cost.
[301:42.01]Because I don't want to put the burden back to you guys, because then it's like, holy shit, well, that was a lot of money.
[301:50.41]Should we give him more?
[301:51.55]No.
[301:52.55]No, the answer is no.
[301:54.42]Like, full stop, no.
[301:55.86]Absolute no.
[302:05.43]But if I can put money back into the stream, because the stream makes money.
[302:12.09]anybody with a calculator and a computer can you could take some wild guesses as to how much money this this stream takes in a month you could so if I'm capable I want to put money back into the stream and do fun shit why the hell wouldn't I
[302:48.41]there's no reason in my for me it's just oh okay this I have some like I have revenue from this channel do I do a carnival or do I not do a carnival the answer will always be I will do a carnival you know always so that's just the way it is and that's the that's there you go I'm naked in front of you
[303:24.43]A Yoda 985 thanks to 281.
[303:26.45]You're a Persona 5 villain.
[303:38.50]And that's also where we get into, not to go any further on this, but that's also where it comes down to
[303:46.40]Maybe involve a company or a sponsorship that thinks some of those ideas are funny.
[303:52.26]And, like, lets me kind of do what I want to do.
[303:55.98]And, like, helps out financially.
[303:58.51]Like, maybe I can not have to do that much more money.
[304:02.79]You know what I mean?
[304:03.23]Maybe, like, alright, meet me halfway or something like that.
[304:08.85]To do streams like those.
[304:12.73]We brought this up a month ago or so.
[304:20.96]And I don't know, is that possible?
[304:22.44]Maybe.
[304:27.94]But if I can make a better stream, then I'm going to take the avenue that allows me to do that.
[304:40.47]Or at least, I try to make a better stream.
[304:42.55]I try to.
[304:43.05]Because that's all I can do is just try.
[304:48.03]And like, that's it.
[304:49.93]Was it good?
[304:50.75]Was it bad?
[304:51.65]Maybe it wasn't so good.
[304:54.75]Maybe some of the projects you've seen, you're like, that wasn't that great.
[305:00.26]Did I learn something from it?
[305:01.28]Can I try again the next time?
[305:02.52]Maybe.
[305:07.19]But I don't want to get long-winded more than I already am about this.
[305:18.62]Off Bugleberry Pottery.
[305:19.92]Cough.
[305:20.22]No, no, that was worth it.
[305:22.44]That's like one of my favorite things.
[305:25.31]I like, I love that segment.
[305:27.09]It's like, I can't wait to see him back on camera.
[305:37.26]Fine.
[305:38.10]We're gonna move on.
[305:40.82]uh do not take anything I said for any reason I think you need to be concerned about my financial life yes yes I I I pulled from a retirement account to make the Jerma Rumble video and I would do it a thousand more times uh because that was some of the most fun I've ever had in my entire life and I will never have that experience again that's an experience that I will never have again and it was an experience I will never forget it was absolutely worth doing
[306:06.91]But that was also like almost five years ago now.
[306:10.45]So don't worry.
[306:11.17]Don't worry, I'm doing fine.
[306:24.94]Until live action Rumble 2.
[306:28.34]which will be live and streamed on Twitch.
[306:32.28]That's the plan.
[306:34.25]I want to do one on Twitch and I want to do one live on Twitch.
[306:39.45]I've told the whole, the whole thing's already written.
[306:42.25]The whole thing's done.
[306:43.23]It just needs to be set up and videotaped.
[306:48.87]Who has any idea of when that's going to happen?
[306:50.84]I have no idea.
[306:52.40]Probably not for a long time.
[307:03.40]Here goes another 40k.
[307:07.49]No, no, but I don't want it to- I just- alright.
[307:09.57]I don't- I- this is why I don't like talking about like money and shit.
[307:12.19]I don't want it to be like, ugh, whatever.
[307:17.86]Let's keep going.
[307:18.38]We're almost done.
[307:22.22]Uh, we have... The man with the baby hands thanks for 500 bits.
[307:29.17]Chad has been more psychotic than usual tonight.
[307:34.55]I mean, early in the stream, people were fucking going nuts.
[307:37.54]They were very mean today to me.
[307:41.28]They were very mean to me.
[307:42.48]They said, he's stupid.
[307:43.52]He has no rhythm.
[307:44.60]He's dumb.
[307:51.75]Then I turned the webcam on and one of my teeth fell out.
[307:55.55]I was like, what the fuck did you guys fucking do?
[307:57.45]I don't know.
[308:00.13]Is that possible?
[308:00.79]Can you guys radio frequency when one of my teeth fall out?
[308:05.23]This is weird.
[308:11.52]And then I played the same song in their ears a hundred times.
[308:14.88]And then people were like, I'm going to bed.
[308:18.54]Which is completely understandable.
[308:22.38]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[308:22.92]Hey, M Weldo, thanks for the 250.
[308:27.22]They say it can be done.
[308:30.58]What can be done?
[308:38.08]What is this?
[308:38.52]F it up?
[308:41.40]By Lewis Cole?
[308:44.70]And be done.
[308:50.81]What is it?
[309:11.30]Yeah, you can fit people here.
[309:18.11]But the only difference is they're not in full marching band costume.
[309:23.83]And they're not all playing trumpets and tubas.
[309:26.07]Remember, I want a tuba.
[309:29.59]It can be done though, yeah.
[309:35.20]I want a link.
[309:35.82]Here's your link.
[309:42.18]This is ridiculous, though.
[309:54.23]Anywho.
[309:55.99]Hey, Delkit.
[309:56.77]Thanks for this freaking abyss.
[309:57.63]Jeremy, first time ever donating.
[309:58.71]Do you plan on playing Morrowind or even perhaps Daggerfall?
[310:03.37]Um, probably at some point.
[310:05.75]I feel like you kind of have to.
[310:10.96]Star and I were talking recently about getting SWAT4 together.
[310:19.12]Something that we've been trying to do for a long time and it came on to GOG and seemed like a fun idea.
[310:25.09]And... I was also talking to Etalyx about it.
[310:31.15]Maybe get a few people.
[310:32.35]Get three, four people maybe and do some SWAT.
[310:40.63]Recently, for the past six years.
[310:42.25]Well, no, no.
[310:42.63]Recently, it came out on GOG.
[310:44.79]Like, last year.
[310:47.30]Six years ago, we were like, let's play SWAT 4!
[310:49.34]But it's like, oh, you can't.
[310:50.46]It's kind of weird.
[310:58.46]You can only do it through LAN, or you had to buy a server or something.
[311:01.22]But now, on GOG, I think you can do a direct connection to each other, I think.
[311:05.31]It was years ago.
[311:10.89]Well, we'll see.
[311:11.97]But it turned out it was something we were talking about.
[311:13.55]Because I know people said, Morrowind multiplayer, do it.
[311:21.03]That's another thing that'd be fun to do with somebody.
[311:22.78]I think a lot of people say when Joel was playing it or something.
[311:27.68]And I don't know.
[311:28.24]It'd be fun.
[311:32.23]But it should be fun to do.
[311:35.49]Peaceful Haley, thanks for $2.50.
[311:38.25]So I moved in with my grandparents and what do you know?
[311:40.81]Their internet is shit.
[311:42.40]Download speed is not even 1 megabit per second and upload is like 2 megabits.
[311:47.86]Rip my stream.
[311:55.07]Damn.
[311:56.83]That's like... That's like next level low.
[312:01.79]That's like in the Earth low.
[312:02.95]That's in the Earth's mantle low.
[312:04.77]That's insane.
[312:14.55]Well, hopefully, you either get it upgraded or get to a new spot, maybe.
[312:21.35]Whatever you do.
[312:24.22]And you could squeeze some work out of two megabits up.
[312:29.70]It's going to be a little crusty, but you might be able to make it work.
[312:34.78]It's possible.
[312:37.36]Raid Joel?
[312:38.02]Yeah, sure.
[312:39.44]Yeah.
[312:44.77]And I don't know, tell him like I shit my pants on stream and it was like insane.
[312:58.70]Like dude, it really, it was fucking crazy.
[313:02.12]He like freaked out and like ran out of the room and like the stream was just on BRB for like fucking 30 minutes.
[313:09.05]And he came back and he was wicked embarrassed and his face was bright fucking red.
[313:11.85]He had facecam on at the time.
[313:12.97]What the fuck?
[313:20.05]He left the game on.
[313:26.60]You're a pathological liar.
[313:31.36]I'm a pathological comedy liar.
[313:34.20]Come on.
[313:36.67]No, excuse me.
[313:37.71]The proper word is storyteller.
[313:40.19]Thank you.
[313:40.91]I'm putting that in my Twitter bio.
[313:52.34]Jerma-985.
[313:54.32]Visionary.
[313:55.18]Storyteller.
[313:57.38]Streamer.
[313:59.34]Liquidator of retirement accounts.
[314:11.41]Say you're a Virgo.
[314:23.23]Yeah, we'll rage y'all.
[314:24.09]You don't have to do that.
[314:27.28]Say hello when we're done here.
[314:28.44]Hey, Yoda. 985.
[314:33.89]Thanks to the $2.81, the year is 2107.
[314:37.47]I check my cybernetic implants and see that Jerma is streaming.
[314:42.49]He's on his deathbed and sadly announces that this is his last stream ever.
[314:46.94]He tells us not to be sad as he's lived a full happy life.
[314:50.90]His heartbeat monitor goes flat and chat is filled with Fs and Jermapludos.
[314:57.56]A full high school marching band kicks in the door and begins filling the room blasting the pirate spy song President Elbertson dies like a true clown beloved
[315:28.71]That's sad.
[315:29.69]Thanks for the $2.81.
[315:30.27]Hey, Reant Deliriation.
[315:34.05]Thanks for the 1,000 bits.
[315:35.21]Jerma said, give more money.
[315:37.49]I'll take it, but I never said that.
[315:39.80]Thanks for the $10.
[315:41.16]King Sherbert987.
[315:42.66]Thanks for the $3.
[315:43.40]Shut up and take my bits.
[315:44.76]I'll take them.
[315:45.76]I'll take them.
[315:46.70]Thank you.
[315:48.04]Chunky Baloney.
[315:48.66]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[315:49.48]Everyone hurry and give him bits while we still can.
[315:53.81]Thanks for the $5.
[315:54.69]Chunky Baloney.
[315:55.47]Unnecessary.
[315:56.05]Don't worry.
[315:56.71]You don't have to give me money ever.
[315:59.49]And I know that that's like, oh, he says that.
[316:01.83]He's saying that, and then people are going to do it.
[316:05.81]Don't feel obligated to give me money.
[316:07.06]You don't have to.
[316:07.64]Look at how good I am.
[316:09.10]I know, I know.
[316:11.18]Look, trust me.
[316:17.84]But you don't have to.
[316:18.46]You really don't.
[316:20.19]If you do, then I'll take it.
[316:26.35]Thank you.
[316:30.80]Okay, I won't give you money.
[316:32.08]Now what?
[316:35.44]Oh.
[316:37.20]Hey, Evil Fish, thanks to 250.
[316:38.66]If you had access to a movie production crew, a well-connected casting director, and a few... I just broke my headphones because I'm sitting here playing with them.
[316:45.19]Same exact thing happened to the last ones.
[316:48.79]Ah.
[316:49.81]Damn it.
[316:50.51]Damn it, damn it, damn it.
[316:51.47]I broke the thing in half.
[316:53.03]It's okay.
[316:53.54]It's the other.
[316:54.14]It's the left headphone.
[316:55.48]I played with it too much and I broke the jelly thing.
[316:58.26]Whoops.
[316:59.38]If you had access to a movie production crew, a well-connected casting director, and a few million dollars, what sort of movie would you make?
[317:03.85]I would make a Jerma Rumble live-action 2.
[317:10.44]Here's a joke that will never make it into a Jerma Rumble, but, um, this is the, this will, this is a two million dollar joke.
[317:19.47]I want to do it really bad, but here's a, here's a, this is, this is written down.
[317:23.79]I wanted one of the contestants to be a school bus that just drives into the ring.
[317:32.62]Oh, here comes, and here comes a school bus!
[317:38.34]And it just drives up and, like, fucking runs the whole ring over, and the ring is ruined.
[317:44.84]But the people are still getting eliminated and stuff.
[317:53.81]Like, the ring is collapsed.
[317:55.57]But people are still, like, having to somehow find a way to, like, throw people over the top rope, even though it's on the ground.
[318:01.65]Two people, like, two people hold up the top rope.
[318:04.77]You know, like, we gotta eliminate this guy!
[318:06.41]He's too good!
[318:07.79]One person holds one side, one person holds the other.
[318:10.01]Taunt.
[318:10.77]And like just to be able to eliminate him.
[318:12.39]Yeah.
[318:15.23]That's like a... That would be... That would be a ton of money.
[318:20.90]That was written down.
[318:21.52]That's one of the things.
[318:22.30]It's not gonna happen ever though.
[318:23.32]You have to throw the bus off the top rope.
[318:31.69]And there'd be... There'd be somebody driving the bus.
[318:34.65]That's like silhouetted out.
[318:35.99]And they never come out.
[318:39.53]Like the camera will pan around.
[318:40.82]There's like a guy in there.
[318:41.92]Just sitting there like just without like an emotionless face.
[318:46.14]He's just sitting there driving the bus.
[318:48.94]Is he the contestant or is it the bus?
[318:50.54]No, it's the bus.
[318:52.46]But that guy never comes out.
[319:05.01]NPC bus driver.
[319:12.10]Why are you linking me a monster eBay link?
[319:24.04]But you have to understand.
[319:31.57]Free local pickup.
[319:35.61]Look.
[319:38.62]Just hurry up and liquidate your retirement account.
[319:41.58]I wanna do it so bad.
[319:42.79]So, you'll know, you'll know if I got what I wanted, like in quotes creatively speaking, if a school bus runs the fucking ring over at some point in live Rumble 2.
[320:11.00]Keep an eye out.
[320:23.84]And it would just go on as if it was normal for a while.
[320:31.18]There's like another thought of like, oh, it's fucking ruined.
[320:35.94]It's destroyed.
[320:37.90]Oh, I want to tell you this part.
[320:40.12]Oh, but it's so fucking funny.
[320:43.28]It's the funniest thing that I've ever thought of.
[320:47.71]And I don't care if you think it's funny.
[320:49.87]Yes, this one's funny.
[320:56.95]No, this one will happen.
[321:00.06]Is somebody going to suplex the bus?
[321:01.30]Can you imagine fucking like getting cranes?
[321:10.67]And having like to be able to have the bus get suplexed?
[321:16.11]Somebody could get crushed.
[321:18.51]I don't... That's not going to happen.
[321:24.98]Someone could be in serious danger.
[321:34.50]The bus runs over the ring.
[321:37.41]And then in real time, while they're still wrestling in the ring, immediately a construction crew is called to build a second ring next to the ring that was destroyed.
[321:50.90]And then they move to the next one.
[321:52.84]And somebody accidentally eliminates themself.
[321:55.14]Because they've walked over the top rope.
[321:56.46]Because they was... Alright, everybody get over to the next one.
[321:59.20]Hurry the fuck up.
[322:00.08]Like the referees.
[322:01.39]And the guy that was doing really good at the time steps over the top rope.
[322:04.57]Okay.
[322:05.45]He's out.
[322:07.19]Stop spoiling.
[322:09.79]This is like 3,000 of these in Jerma Rumble Live 2.
[322:12.09]Don't worry.
[322:14.93]I'm giving you teasers of hypothetical jokes.
[322:25.80]Are these written down?
[322:26.38]The whole thing's written down.
[322:28.05]It's all done.
[322:28.42]It's done.
[322:40.64]That was one thing where it was like, holy shit, that's, like, not possible, but it's kind of funny.
[322:46.06]And if I ever had, like, the right crew, and the lots of fucking money, whether it's from a sponsorship, right, or something, somebody, stuff like that, these are all, like, fun hypotheticals to tell you, like, oh, he's spoiling.
[322:58.78]No, I mean, that's, you're talking about, that's, that's...
[323:01.78]probably hundreds of thousands of dollars like let's be real to get something like that to be a reality it's just it's a lot and I don't know I did that's why in case it doesn't happen yeah I need to tell you you know because it probably won't I have to tell you I've been I've been having I've wanted to tell you about the school bus entrant for like two and a half years and I did because it's fun
[323:42.42]Who wins?
[323:42.82]Why would I tell you who wins?
[323:46.74]Anyways, let's keep going.
[323:52.70]Uh, but that's what I would do.
[323:55.04]And Evil Fish, that's what I would do if I had a well-connected casting director, a million dollars, and I could do whatever I wanted.
[324:02.81]It's a school bus joke.
[324:05.83]There you go.
[324:07.21]I have to be honest.
[324:10.24]Wembley TTV, thanks for the 250.
[324:13.12]Sad to say you failed at that Metal Gear Solid 2 reference.
[324:16.42]After you get asked that a hundred times during the game.
[324:19.92]But I find it funny during your rants about paying your taxes.
[324:22.04]You remind me of an old WWF wrestler, Erwin R. Scheister.
[324:25.72]IRS cutting a promo about people not paying them.
[324:34.26]IRS.
[324:34.62]What an interesting character.
[324:46.14]Okay, so this is, uh... Rip Alex Trebek, thanks for the five dollars.
[324:53.06]Jeremiah, I love this video.
[324:54.18]What do you think?
[324:54.76]Let's find out what I think about it.
[324:58.57]What the hell is this?
[325:15.54]I don't like it.
[325:16.50]There you go.
[325:17.28]That's my opinion.
[325:21.74]Hey, Yoda985, thanks for the 250.
[325:26.77]What happens on the day Jerma thinks jermaFear jermaMars killing people is fun?
[325:34.31]Bunker S. Was this a reference to the school bus thing?
[325:39.99]The school bus driving into the ring?
[325:55.57]No, the school bus getting suplexed.
[326:03.03]Can't you just imagine the school bus getting suplexed and it's on its back upside down and it's just still trying to drive?
[326:10.02]Like the wheels are like spinning.
[326:18.68]And then everybody has to like get over and like lift it and lift it out of the ring and roll it out of the ring.
[326:28.48]Yeah, the driver's still emotionless.
[326:30.16]There would be at least two or three close-ups of this dude driving the bus while even like in the air being suplexed.
[326:38.16]And he's just like kind of putting his like fingers on his nose and like kind of like blinking.
[326:41.69]And he's not, it's not him.
[326:42.91]It's the bus.
[326:49.88]He's just there.
[326:50.44]He's just like a crew member.
[326:51.50]He just like has to be in there.
[326:59.32]It has to explode when it gets thrown out of the ring.
[327:02.30]You just added another $500,000 to this project.
[327:22.22]Hey, Behema, thanks for 250.
[327:23.96]Oh, God, I'm sorry I made you reveal your carnival secret.
[327:26.06]Please eat, you starving artist.
[327:28.24]That's not even true.
[327:31.66]I was going to tell you guys one day.
[327:34.54]I didn't want to... It was long enough.
[327:37.17]What was it, October of last year?
[327:42.91]Yeah, it's been long enough.
[327:44.49]You can know.
[327:45.19]That's okay.
[327:46.05]That's fine.
[327:47.25]I got plenty of baby food.
[327:48.31]Right.
[327:48.93]So everything's good.
[327:51.09]We're going to do the credits.
[327:54.74]Here they come.
[327:57.44]Thanks for subbing this channel.
[328:03.00]Everybody.
[328:09.90]How long has he been talking?
[328:11.36]Five hours and 29 minutes.
[328:14.96]Give or take.
[328:17.00]Strings of about 30 to 40 seconds where I was silent trying to play the concentration video game.
[328:26.32]Thanks, everybody, for the subs.
[328:32.24]All of you.
[328:35.22]Continuing to support this guy.
[328:41.34]None of you have to do it.
[328:42.90]A lot of you do, so thank you.
[328:49.30]Appreciate it.
[328:50.54]They're all gifted subs, and I can't even fucking believe that.
[328:56.10]Thanks a lot, guys.
[328:58.70]We're gonna finish the bits.
[329:01.43]DemonHunter790, thanks for the $2.50.
[329:03.49]Jerma confirmed to never retire from streaming.
[329:06.59]I will one day.
[329:08.19]I can't lie to you guys.
[329:09.35]I will one day.
[329:12.72]I don't think I could ever just, like, not do it, though.
[329:21.08]I could probably... I would probably... I would probably just tone it down maybe eventually over the years.
[329:30.31]Instead of streaming like three, four days a week or four days a week or something.
[329:33.73]I would probably just kind of be a presence.
[329:37.45]I'd still be around.
[329:41.41]You got to make the last stream a wild one.
[329:52.64]Yeah, I mean, it's not gonna happen anytime soon, but it is gonna happen.
[329:59.34]I would tone it down first before I really was like, alright, bye.
[330:04.46]I would stream like, I don't know, once I got to the point where I was like, alright, this has been really fun, but it's time for me to step down.
[330:11.36]I don't know, I probably would stream like once or twice a week.
[330:16.74]I wouldn't just disappear.
[330:17.58]I would slowly be like, alright guys, I'm gonna take some time and
[330:26.28]No, this is not happening like tomorrow.
[330:28.46]This is like in the distant future.
[330:41.68]How could this happen?
[330:42.62]Tell us yesterday's spoiler.
[330:46.98]I will tell you yesterday's spoiler when I play next month's game.
[330:51.93]Because you'll see it on camera.
[330:58.84]825 Dr. Pepper, thanks for the $2.50.
[331:00.18]I'm very excited you're going to play Resident Evil 3, but to be honest, I doubt it will take longer than one stream.
[331:06.16]Also, I like the older games in the series, like the Resident Evil 1 remake, I think have a lot of stream potential.
[331:10.77]Thanks for being entertaining as always.
[331:15.23]No, I don't think it'll take us that long either.
[331:19.83]I'm looking forward to it.
[331:20.93]I've been putting it off for a long time.
[331:25.00]Get your kin to stream on the channel.
[331:26.76]The Twitch channel must persist through the ages.
[331:32.13]I'm kind of afraid to have kids.
[331:35.27]I feel like my kid would bite me in my sleep and drain all my blood and take all my powers.
[331:57.78]Is that all I have to do?
[332:03.66]He would become, he or she would become the next streamer.
[332:08.19]Can you imagine like a little, like Jerma or like Jermette?
[332:13.69]And they kind of look like me in a way, and they're like, look at me, look at me, it's me.
[332:19.27]You guys would fucking hate this kid.
[332:21.69]Are you serious?
[332:24.07]No way.
[332:24.57]You guys would hate this kid.
[332:26.31]You'd be like, it's not the same.
[332:28.03]Fuck this kid.
[332:29.97]This kid sucks.
[332:32.96]What a cheap imitation of the real thing.
[332:35.70]Get your dad.
[332:36.06]Where's dad?
[332:39.33]I don't know what you guys are talking about.
[332:40.47]Wait, what do you mean?
[332:41.15]Uh, shpee, look at me.
[332:44.10]Shut up, kid.
[332:44.94]Where's dad?
[332:46.20]Hold on, son.
[332:46.94]Let me just come in here and say, hey, guys.
[332:49.52]How's everybody doing?
[332:50.88]How the fuck are you?
[332:52.02]Jermamites?
[332:53.22]And they would be like, fucking pog.
[332:54.90]Pog, pog, pog, pog, pog.
[332:56.24]Pog, pog.
[332:57.68]I'll see you Jermamites later.
[333:00.38]And they would be like, oh my, there he was.
[333:03.37]And then like fucking 5,000 people would leave.
[333:06.09]And like, maybe like, maybe like 60 of you would stick around to watch like, Gerber Jr.
[333:12.22]985.
[333:21.58]Dink and doink the clown.
[333:27.85]What an egomaniac.

[334:18.10]Thanks for the five dollars.
[334:21.28]You really inspire me to keep working towards my goals.
[334:23.13]The passion you put into some of your content is amazing.
[334:25.67]Also, stop playing the game through an OBS screen.
[334:28.35]Bye.
[334:32.65]I... I didn't.
[334:37.40]I didn't play the game through an OBS screen.
[334:41.26]I played the game on my fucking monitor.
[334:58.19]It's so easy.
[335:01.26]I've come to realize... It's so easy.
[335:05.52]It's like, you guys can just... You guys have... It's so... You can just... It's so easy for you guys just to get me going.
[335:13.35]I... It's easy.

[335:37.80]It's alright.
[335:38.46]Ugh.
[335:39.56]Yeah, you guys get, I'm the easiest person, I think, to get, like, going.
[335:44.90]All it takes is, like, one sentence for me to be like, excuse me.
[335:48.24]Fuck, hold on.
[335:52.52]I'm replacing coffee with, like, hot milk.
[335:57.08]I'm gonna, like, start to, like, slow down.
[336:01.63]Hey, Digitron surfers!
[336:02.45]It's a picture of a lady talking to a baby.
[336:05.48]It says, Yucky.

[337:07.11]In, like, June.
[337:15.30]Thanks for the free dolls.
[337:16.80]Thank you, Transcout, for the $5.
[337:18.36]Dude, get some fidgets.
[337:19.80]I have ADHD, too, and I'm always wrecking my shit because I fidget a ton.
[337:23.48]I recommend Koosh Balls or Tangle Toys.
[337:25.20]Look them up.
[337:25.64]I lose them.
[337:27.91]I buy them and then they disappear in like three hours.
[337:31.45]Oh, cool.
[337:34.61]Cool, man.
[337:36.89]The next day, I don't know where it is.
[337:40.59]It's gone.
[337:41.05]Forever.
[337:44.78]I stopped getting them.
[337:48.82]Thanks to the five dollars, though.
[337:55.53]They are fun.
[337:55.89]They do work.
[337:56.35]Hens.
[337:56.65]Uh...
[338:19.43]Rubik's cubes are fun too.
[338:21.69]Also... What's like another one of my favorite things?
[338:24.85]I like, um... I like utensils, if that's weird.
[338:29.70]I like, um... The hard drive just locked up.
[338:34.74]You can see the light blinking.
[338:37.18]What's happening, man?
[338:38.26]The light's just fucking solid.
[338:40.14]The hard drive light is solid, but the... This thing's a piece of shit.
[338:50.05]What the fuck?
[338:53.31]Maybe I shouldn't have torrented.
[338:58.45]Every single fucking Ben 10 episode.
[339:00.85]I knew one of those had a fucking virus on it.
[339:13.53]Hey, Scott713TF2, thanks for the five dollars.
[339:19.16]Jerma, a couple years ago when you played TF2 on stream, you said that you had an idea for a Jerma Rumble as an onstage play that you'd do in one take, keeping the fuck-ups in.
[339:29.65]Is that still a possibility?
[339:30.65]Thank you again for all the laughs.
[339:32.41]Yes.
[339:32.75]There's gonna be, like, choreography and dance numbers and singing and getting eliminated would be, like, a big extravagant, like, song.
[339:49.98]Yes, of course it's still up there.
[340:00.31]Entrances.
[340:01.31]In the ring, there'd be big elaborate dance numbers.
[340:14.84]But yeah, that's no longer in the front.
[340:18.68]It's somewhere in the back.
[340:22.96]Thanks for the $5, though.
[340:27.11]DemonHunter790, thanks for the $2.50.
[340:28.45]I knew the Ster truck punchline would find its way back.
[340:34.17]It would be the bus punchline this time.
[340:37.84]FutureGamer, thanks for the $2.50.
[340:39.18]I feel like if you stopped streaming, you would enter month two of retirement and come back full force.
[340:43.88]Probably.
[340:48.10]Probably.
[340:55.65]Yeah, I would probably be like, okay, I'd be one of those professional athletes that retires like four times.
[341:05.56]It's my last game.
[341:07.58]I'm done.
[341:09.60]And then a year goes by and they're on the free agent list again.
[341:13.00]Anyone want me to play for them?
[341:15.02]I'm kind of bored.
[341:27.49]Yeah, if I do the funeral stream, then I can't come back.
[341:31.95]When are we raiding Joel?
[341:42.20]Right now.
[341:44.40]I'll see you guys on Monday.
[341:45.28]Thanks for watching, as always.
[341:48.98]And we got some fun stuff coming up, so stay tuned.
[341:51.54]What is Joel doing?
[342:00.65]We'll find out.
[342:04.87]Go say hello.
[342:05.77]I'll see you Monday.
[342:07.45]Take care of yourselves, as always.
[342:08.53]Have a great night.
[342:11.13]Have a good weekend.
[342:11.91]See you guys soon.
[342:22.06]See you guys soon.
[342:22.98]Did I get cut off?
[342:23.50]Okay.
[342:27.28]It went through.
[342:28.34]Good night.
[342:35.15]Thank you.
