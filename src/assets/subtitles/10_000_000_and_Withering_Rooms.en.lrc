[00:17.17]Oh, shit.
[00:18.21]I accidentally pressed the go live button.
[00:21.46]Oh, no.
[00:22.38]Oops.
[00:24.64]I was cleaning up my desktop and the cloth was getting over there near the start stream button and as I was like, I must have pressed it.
[00:43.70]What's up?
[00:47.28]11 o'clock in the morning.
[00:53.08]You doing two days in a row?
[00:54.26]Dude's retired.
[00:58.05]Yeah, I just kind of feel like it.
[01:00.87]Last night we did a little thing.
[01:02.41]And I was like, you know what?
[01:06.39]Fuck it.
[01:06.69]I kind of want to stream tomorrow too.
[01:19.62]What a deceiver.
[01:22.10]I think I did say last night.
[01:24.30]Hey, yeah, it might say something in the next six months.
[01:29.17]Goes live literally the next morning.
[01:34.03]I am just all over the place.
[01:36.19]I just am.
[01:36.89]And yet you, I'm just never to be trusted with anything.
[01:42.92]But you know what?
[01:46.22]I just feel like doing it and that's the way it is.
[01:51.00]Actually, I was watching Ster play Withering Rooms yesterday after the stream.
[02:01.24]And I was like, you know what?
[02:02.60]I want to talk about that game.
[02:04.60]I need to tell you about it.
[02:06.07]And I didn't.
[02:12.51]Tell us.
[02:13.67]I'm going to.
[02:17.56]We are so back.
[02:19.28]We are so back.
[02:21.46]Right now.
[02:22.68]For one day only.
[02:25.89]We're going to make that a thing, by the way, okay?
[02:28.13]Every time I go live from here on out, I want it to be a spam of one day only, one day only.
[02:35.59]Well, let's make it like a funny meme.
[02:38.95]For one day only.
[02:40.59]And everybody like spams it and it's like, yo, that's right.
[02:43.45]It's one day.
[02:49.56]Oh, he's forcing memes.
[02:51.34]That's not how you do it.
[02:59.55]Yeah.
[03:00.11]You know what I felt like doing?
[03:00.99]I felt like talking about withering rooms.
[03:02.87]And I felt like playing 10 million.
[03:06.49]I'm just going to sip some coffee and game.
[03:08.11]It's been a while.
[03:10.29]How do I do that?
[03:12.99]Let me sit up.
[03:14.11]No, don't sit up.
[03:14.85]Let me sit back in my recliner.
[03:25.20]and it's EU friendly it is whenever it is it'd be Sunday at fucking two o'clock in the morning it could be Thursday at one in the afternoon it could be right now at 11 a.m we'll just fucking do it when we do it and whatever it is today it's 10 million you guys know 10 million some of you probably do
[03:51.46]I got the urge to play this, too, because I was and I know this is some people are going to be like, wait, match three.
[03:57.79]Oh, no, he really is like an old man.
[04:00.33]This is an old one.
[04:01.11]This is from a long time ago.
[04:03.45]This is one of my favorite games, I think.
[04:11.98]How do you drink your coffee?
[04:12.82]I drink my coffee black.
[04:15.16]Well, it depends.
[04:17.79]Is it a fun day?
[04:18.65]Okay, am I going out to have like a fun day?
[04:25.52]Or am I just chilling at the house?
[04:29.32]Or am I going to work, right?
[04:30.31]Am I like working?
[04:32.11]So to me, black coffee is it's time to go to work or it's time to chill.
[04:38.93]It's funny how it works.
[04:39.78]It can be two different things.
[04:43.59]Sweet, sugary coffee with cream and milk and hazelnut and cinnamon dust.
[04:50.14]To me, that's a I'm going out.
[04:51.96]It's a going out drink.
[04:55.36]Black coffee is work or chill.
[04:57.69]Sweetened coffee is I'm going out today.
[05:03.65]You're a masochist.
[05:09.95]You know, when some of you grow up, you know, when you grow up a little, you're going to take a sip out of black coffee one day, a good black coffee, and you're going to go, I have finally reached adulthood.
[05:34.36]no no no what is this no what is it I don't want to grow up I'm a toys r us kid I never want to grow up I'm not going to drink black coffee ever I just want rice crispy treats I will stay young forever I can't even hear the game
[06:09.03]Yeah, we're playing 10 million.
[06:11.05]Let's freaking go.
[06:12.35]And I'm going to actually, I'll probably, a little bit later, I'll probably play a little bit of Withering Rooms.
[06:16.53]I'm going to show Withering Rooms.
[06:17.57]I just want you to know it exists.
[06:23.91]Yeah, I'm ready to just chill.
[06:31.01]Have you played the sequel?
[06:31.99]I have.
[06:33.09]You Must Build a Boat.
[06:34.75]That's also very good.
[06:44.01]You're watching this while you're in... Okay.
[06:48.47]He's only back for one day only, guys.
[06:50.03]That's right.
[06:50.39]Yeah.
[06:52.53]Hey, spread the news.
[06:53.75]Only one day only.
[06:54.85]Alright, let's go.
[07:08.82]Okay, I love the music too.
[07:10.04]It's really cute.
[07:13.17]Alright, so 10 million.
[07:14.35]How 10 million works.
[07:17.27]You gotta get to 10 million points.
[07:20.63]When you get to 10 million points, you get to leave the dungeon.
[07:26.03]Get it?
[07:27.27]Very simple.
[07:28.65]Eventually these open up for upgrading, which... Let's just show you how it works.
[07:38.82]Where's facecam?
[07:39.86]It ain't here.
[07:43.37]Forward your complaints.
[07:44.43]Alright, learn to play.
[07:48.64]Let's play a game.
[07:56.18]It is a match three game, but actually it's kind of loud, isn't it?
[07:59.70]A little loud.
[08:00.26]I'll turn it down just a tad.
[08:01.87]Alright.
[08:03.97]So game is sick.
[08:05.95]Hear me out on this one.
[08:08.61]No face.
[08:09.31]No face game means naked.
[08:12.36]I cannot confirm or deny anything that you were saying.
[08:14.60]Alright, so you slide things together.
[08:17.64]It's three.
[08:18.28]It's either horizontal or vertical like this.
[08:21.28]I mean like that.
[08:22.64]On the top of the screen, you've got shit going on up here.
[08:25.14]This is a zombie.
[08:27.18]Got him.
[08:27.68]Wands are damage too.
[08:28.80]Wands and swords.
[08:32.73]I got so addicted to this game at one point.
[08:34.41]It was like the only thing I was doing for like two or three weeks straight.
[08:51.13]Why do I have nothing?
[08:52.91]Yes, I do.
[08:53.15]Right there.
[08:55.35]So you build up shit.
[08:57.45]This game is like almost 15 years old, by the way.
[09:01.51]But, you know, I may have seen a few iPad game ads for other things in this genre over the last few days.
[09:09.42]And, you know, it got me thinking I haven't played 10 million and I want to play it.
[09:11.66]Alright, the keys open doors and chests.
[09:16.44]This is older than some chatters.
[09:18.10]It's
[09:20.52]You know what?
[09:20.82]It probably is.
[09:21.64]I need another key.
[09:26.81]There we go.
[09:33.33]Yeah, you get items.
[09:34.87]The game is just sick.
[09:36.19]It just really is.
[09:36.81]How old is it?
[09:40.61]I want to say... What is it?
[09:42.51]2012?
[09:42.53]2013?
[09:42.55]You got to be quick on your feet, too.
[09:53.53]Key, key, key, come on, come on, come on.
[09:56.13]Shit.
[09:58.03]Uh, shit.
[09:59.01]I need a key.
[10:00.65]I'll take some wood, it's fine.
[10:03.43]Got it.
[10:07.02]Yeah, so if your guy goes all the way to the end, you lose.
[10:14.12]what is this like bejeweled I like this more than bejeweled because there you'll see that there's like a full-on there's a full-on upgrading system is a full-on there's like a money system where you have to spend money and upgrade your guy it's a whole it's a whole thing alright this is a boss a scary dinosaur yeah if you get pushed all the way back which is going to happen probably in a second here
[10:41.72]Think I can beat 10 million in one sitting?
[10:43.60]100% no.
[10:45.42]Yeah, you build up shields.
[10:51.49]That's my shield.
[10:53.27]This other shit.
[10:53.77]You don't have to worry about this till later.
[10:55.11]Don't worry.
[10:58.40]Baby's first gambling?
[11:02.40]It's a match three game.
[11:08.73]How fucking far has gaming fallen?
[11:11.63]Where if you see three of the same symbol in a row, you are automatically assuming it's going to be like a monetized insanity.
[11:23.22]This is how you get resources to upgrade your dungeon area.
[11:31.02]Slot machines have been around forever.
[11:32.46]That's true, yeah.
[11:36.97]Am I going to make it?
[11:39.23]Oh, I don't think so.
[11:41.44]I don't think so.
[11:45.62]Actually doing pretty good.
[11:51.44]Uh, yeah, backpacks.
[11:52.42]These are backpacks.
[11:53.07]These give skill points.
[11:55.75]I think, yeah, it's all over here.
[11:59.57]Only retired streamers play this game.
[12:02.57]Oh, yeah.
[12:04.31]Hey, isn't it a beautiful thing?
[12:08.13]Okay, so there we go.
[12:09.17]I got 21,000.
[12:09.83]Pretty shy of 10 million.
[12:16.11]How come you're streaming?
[12:16.85]I don't know.
[12:19.05]After yesterday, I kind of wanted to... I don't know.
[12:20.59]I got the urge.
[12:23.12]And I watched Ster stream Withering Rooms, and I needed... I was screaming at my laptop.
[12:31.23]of just how he couldn't figure out one of the controls, and I was just yelling it in his chat, and, oh, you know, I gotta go live.
[12:38.19]Alright, so here, take a look.
[12:45.18]We need 300 wood, 300 stone.
[12:46.98]I don't have that.
[12:48.34]Uh, this is 100?
[12:52.64]100?
[12:52.70]Uh, which one is the damage one?
[12:56.60]I guess this one down here.
[13:05.79]Yes, I could just do another one and save it, but.
[13:14.85]OK, here we go.
[13:15.97]Grant's bonus time when matching five in a row.
[13:19.69]I think that's worth it.
[13:20.37]That's 100 points.
[13:22.71]Oh, by the way, you can upgrade the upgrade station.
[13:27.14]What's that?
[13:28.08]Yep, you can upgrade the upgrade station.
[13:30.62]Revolutionary shit.
[13:38.44]the game's called 10 million just 10 if you're looking it up on Steam it's 10 hold on what 10 comma zero zero zero comma zero zero just type in 10 million the way that it is as the number alright we need to do 20 swords use an item I need eight double matches let's go
[14:06.35]This dude is deranged.
[14:07.61]I just... You know what?
[14:10.60]Hey.
[14:10.72]Get the fuck out of here.
[14:18.96]Hey, by the way, music is banging.
[14:21.16]Just in case anyone was curious.
[14:26.51]Uh, key.
[14:30.23]There you go.
[14:34.90]If you get five in a row, it is pretty PogChamp, I'll tell you.
[14:49.26]I do have a key, that's right, yeah.
[14:53.61]There we go, five in a row.
[14:55.11]No, don't... Actually, yeah.
[14:57.03]I need it for the quest.
[15:01.73]It's awesome when you get the, like...
[15:07.47]I'll use it.
[15:17.60]This is a wild, I think.
[15:19.98]Keys, keys, keys.
[15:22.27]Keys, there we go.
[15:25.25]I got another key in that chest.
[15:27.03]So good.
[15:34.75]Wands are really... Don't sleep on the wands, those of you that are playing right now.
[15:40.53]How many viewers are here right now?
[15:41.57]Like 10 million?
[15:45.59]I'm going to use them all in a row.
[15:48.28]Ready?
[15:48.46]Watch this.
[15:49.30]Boom.
[15:50.96]I don't have time to match anything.
[15:51.92]I'm going to fall off.
[15:53.66]Use the ball to damage move.
[15:56.36]Alright.
[15:56.80]I kind of saved it right there.
[16:02.34]This is a pretty good one.
[16:08.22]I'm at the dragon already.
[16:10.88]There's no way I'd be the dragon right now.
[16:12.84]Not a chance in hell.
[16:17.32]Oh, shit.
[16:19.92]Alright, that's like stage one, effectively.
[16:26.86]What did you say?
[16:28.51]My town is watching this projected on the side of our church.
[16:33.59]You live in a really fucked up town.
[16:46.00]Alright, I have... no.
[16:49.86]Let's bank everything and just go.
[16:51.26]Alright, this is going to be a wood and stone run.
[16:55.64]I'm just going to try to collect wood and stone.
[17:05.75]Eight double matches, 60,000 points.
[17:08.29]Okay, white dragons at the end.
[17:11.59]Yeah, alright, this is wood and stone run.
[17:16.45]Uh, do what?
[17:17.05]Why am I?
[17:17.35]What am I doing?
[17:17.95]Do wood and stone run.
[17:19.05]What am I doing?
[17:19.73]Um... Dude, what are you doing?
[17:29.06]This is not a wood and stone run.
[17:30.56]This has been a disaster run.
[17:34.28]I have to kill this guy.
[17:35.90]Oh my god, I fucked it up.
[17:36.92]Alright, wood and stone.
[17:47.88]Shit.
[17:50.66]Backpacks are fine too.
[17:58.32]There's a ton of stone here.
[18:05.95]Shit.
[18:07.09]Sorry.
[18:09.91]How come all these games you play look awesome?
[18:13.37]You know, I would say there is a direct scientific correlation to a game that looks awesome and is awesome.
[18:23.29]Although that's not entirely true considering the amount of trailers we've seen that game shows that will tell us otherwise.
[18:32.78]It's actually the worst statement I could have possibly made.
[18:36.50]Hey, guys, you know, judge every book by its cover.
[18:45.29]That's kind of a bad thing to say.
[18:47.75]Not the greatest advice.
[18:52.86]What's the game called?
[18:53.50]10 million.
[18:58.08]10 million.
[18:59.92]Hey, let me spell it out for you.
[19:01.20]10,000,000.
[19:02.22]How much money do I have?
[19:04.90]Okay, wood and stone run.
[19:12.63]I need it.
[19:15.87]There we go.
[19:16.33]That's what I'm talking about.
[19:20.59]That is what we're talking about.
[19:30.80]Fuck, do it.
[19:35.28]Um... Here.
[19:40.47]Alright, I hope it's a key because... Yeah, just do it twice because I need the... There we go.
[19:47.18]Okay, got a key right here.
[19:48.10]Got a bunch of stone.
[19:50.30]Good.
[19:54.92]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[19:56.52]Come on, come on, come on.
[20:00.66]Oh, at least there's a lot of wood.
[20:01.62]Hold on.
[20:07.01]I'm at the dragon again.
[20:07.81]You're not supposed to kill the dragon this early.
[20:10.43]I mean, I might just be that good.
[20:15.87]There we go.
[20:24.18]Oh, dude called off his retirement.
[20:26.08]I love that I'm up at like 11 a.m.
[20:28.28]drinking like a coffee playing like 10 million.
[20:31.25]And that is me calling off my retirement.
[20:33.71]If anything, that should be hammering the nail in.
[20:36.61]11 a.m.
[20:39.24]with a coffee playing 10 million.
[20:41.40]Oh.
[20:52.58]What happened to Elden Ring?
[20:53.76]Dude, Elden Ring is... I'm not playing Elden Ring right now.
[20:57.83]Alright, I need... I got a lot of money.
[21:04.73]I think I'm going to do this.
[21:07.99]Just helps.
[21:09.48]Oh, wait, wait.
[21:09.88]Magic, wood, and stone.
[21:10.78]Ooh.
[21:12.54]Nah, we'll do this.
[21:14.82]I need more wood and stone.
[21:19.56]I want to show Withering Rooms later as well.
[21:26.39]And I don't know how long the stream's gonna be.
[21:27.79]Maybe a few hours?
[21:28.45]Maybe a couple hours?
[21:29.17]I don't know.
[21:32.37]Whenever I'm, uh... Whenever I'm done, I'm done.
[21:40.51]What about Balatro?
[21:41.27]I played a lot of Balatro.
[21:43.05]It is very, very good.
[21:44.15]Okay.
[21:51.94]If I get to the dragon again... I don't think I have the damage to kill the dragon.
[21:57.71]Maybe I do.
[21:58.15]I'm just not confident enough.
[22:07.01]I got three balls.
[22:07.77]This is perfect.
[22:09.29]I'm saving the balls for the dragon.
[22:11.41]Okay, well I have to get there.
[22:12.51]Because that'll be an insane damage chunk.
[22:21.89]Oh, shit.
[22:22.63]Come on.
[22:27.64]Yeah, if I don't use these balls, but I can't get any more items though, which is, I guess, frustrating in a way.
[22:33.97]Frustrated.
[22:41.15]Good.
[22:42.86]Good.
[22:48.78]It's early, I'm sorry.
[22:51.46]It wasn't even that big of a deal either.
[22:55.16]That's the kind of reaction we want to do.
[22:57.17]Okay, so in the mobile ads and they show the person playing.
[23:02.75]For something very basic.
[23:06.91]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[23:28.24]You got any mac and cheese recommendations?
[23:31.49]Oh, nah.
[23:32.89]That shit sucks.
[23:33.87]I don't even eat that.
[23:38.01]I'm healthy, Jerma, now.
[23:40.77]Actually, true.
[23:44.02]Alright, I need... Which one of these is the damage one?
[23:48.96]I think it's this one.
[23:55.26]Okay, this is staffs.
[23:57.86]Yep.
[23:59.04]Okay, so right now, each staff does 8 to 15 magical damage.
[24:06.20]And there's a 3.5% chance for a special magical effect.
[24:13.54]I got money.
[24:14.00]8 to 17.
[24:17.55]Okay, so maybe staff quality?
[24:25.86]Okay.
[24:30.63]This thing is ridiculous now.
[24:33.01]So we're going for it to try to make as many staffs as possible.
[24:47.86]It's so funny, I feel like my stream is delayed.
[24:53.43]Because I just looked over here, and I've- how long is the stream?
[24:56.81]I've been live for 25 minutes, and I'm seeing a sh- like a wave of like, what is here live?
[25:04.99]Live!
[25:05.57]I feel like my stream is on a 25 minute delay.
[25:13.23]We just got the notification.
[25:17.43]Oh, the Discord notification went off.
[25:24.61]I don't even know what the fuck to do with that place, by the way.
[25:29.93]In my, like, retirement arc.
[25:34.30]Okay, what do I need?
[25:35.00]Lumberjack.
[25:38.62]Alright, I need to get an axe.
[25:40.80]Six monsters, that's... I can kill six monsters easy, dude.
[25:51.53]This is the wall right now.
[25:55.51]I did upgrade the absolute hell out of the staff though, so it should be much better.
[25:58.88]Okay, one hit kills.
[26:02.34]That's cool.
[26:08.20]There we go.
[26:08.56]Alright.
[26:09.66]I don't really care about swords right now, but I will eventually.
[26:12.28]And what's up in that?
[26:14.13]It's awesome when you get super far up on the screen.
[26:17.56]can eventually be running so fast that you're all the way up here and you get like super like times 10 points it's awesome uh come on keys keys there we go alright I got an axe kill a monster with an axe do I have to kill the monster with an axe or just hurt the monster with the axe
[26:50.23]Alright, I think I got it.
[26:50.87]Ooh, this is going to give a bunch of... It's going to spam keys.
[26:55.15]Okay.
[26:59.82]Keys?
[27:00.30]Nope.
[27:01.90]Kind of on a roll right now.
[27:02.78]This is good.
[27:12.95]Oh, five in a row.
[27:17.29]Mmm... Shit.
[27:22.43]I love this game.
[27:23.35]It's so much fun.
[27:28.31]You know what?
[27:28.65]Let's do this.
[27:28.99]Good.
[27:33.37]That was a lot of money.
[27:35.53]Uh, and then like this.
[27:48.44]Uh...
[27:53.17]Where's the dragon?
[28:00.54]Where's the dragon?
[28:03.90]Oh, fuck.
[28:04.68]I didn't make it to the dragon?
[28:12.50]This game feels like it would be on my grandma's computer.
[28:15.78]I would say your grandmother would have unbelievable taste.
[28:21.27]This is on your grandmother's computer.
[28:23.09]I mean, you should take game advice from grandma then.
[28:25.77]I don't have enough.
[28:37.50]Wait, actually, I have enough to do this.
[28:40.63]Okay, matching wood and stone grants a small time bonus.
[28:43.79]More gold.
[28:45.39]Items.
[28:47.81]Probably this one.
[28:51.19]No, this one's good too.
[28:59.57]More staff.
[29:03.83]Yep.
[29:06.47]Staff Andy.
[29:09.17]Can you play Nancy Drew?
[29:10.31]Probably.
[29:10.69]We'll see.
[29:15.51]I don't know.
[29:20.45]Be sure to have good posture.
[29:21.91]Also, something else I want to do.
[29:25.41]This is not... Oh my god, look at some major change in this new kind of streaming plan that he has.
[29:32.13]Every like 30 minutes, I want to get up and move around.
[29:37.68]It is very important that I do so.
[29:41.16]So we're going to do that.
[29:43.42]We're going to do little stretch sessions.
[29:46.90]You old lady.
[29:48.10]Yeah, I know.
[29:48.74]That's why I'm spraying it up.
[30:00.05]Okay, you know the old lady knows she's an old lady, right?
[30:04.77]If you go to Bingo and there's a bunch of old ladies here and you look around and you just kind of say out loud, you're all old ladies.
[30:13.03]Yeah.
[30:14.92]You're at Bingo.
[30:16.70]They're going to be like, yes.
[30:18.32]Yes, I'm an old lady.
[30:21.24]Why though?
[30:23.30]I don't know.
[30:24.22]Because fucking time is just... We can't stop it, bro.
[30:41.14]I'll sit down and grab a card and a little ink puncher.
[30:55.90]This one's a... I'm not confident on this one.
[31:00.90]Yeah, we'll just restart, whatever.
[31:10.75]It's about you realizing you're the old lady.
[31:13.55]I know, that's what I mean.
[31:18.09]I know I'm the old lady.
[31:19.85]I'm not, okay, I'm not... I'm not the one walking into the bingo hall going, look at all the old ladies.
[31:24.78]I'm already in the bingo hall.
[31:32.08]I know this.
[31:32.60]This thing is disgusting.
[31:43.06]Stretch time?
[31:44.66]Yeah.
[31:45.16]It's been 30 minutes.
[31:45.80]You're right.
[31:46.82]That's a good call.
[31:49.10]Alright, buddy.
[31:50.63]Get up and stretch.
[31:54.99]It's not a get up and stretch.
[31:55.97]It's just I gotta get up and move around.
[31:57.13]Do a yoga routine.
[32:03.72]No, just to walk around the room for a second.
[32:16.33]It is a good bit.
[32:17.71]It's called Your Health.
[32:18.67]You should take it more goddamn seriously.
[32:23.14]It's funny, like...
[32:37.59]Okay, if I were to say, oh guys, I got a wicked funny joke.
[32:41.87]Oh, this is the funniest joke.
[32:43.09]I feel like so many of you guys would be like, oh, what's the funny joke?
[32:46.06]He's going to tell a funny joke.
[32:47.42]I'd be like, yeah, it's hilarious.
[32:49.14]Okay, what we're going to do, it's going to be really funny.
[32:52.42]Everybody's going to get a plate and put like two carrots on it, two pieces of broccoli, like a little bit of salt and a low amount of butter and like, you know, reduce the amount of soda they're going to drink.
[33:04.10]It's going to be wicked funny.
[33:08.53]And maybe I could influence you guys to eat healthy.
[33:10.97]I feel like a lot of you guys would just write +2 and do that.
[33:15.58]And be like, this is the funniest joke ever.
[33:18.08]And what you don't know is you're just being healthy.
[33:29.78]Yeah, to be honest.
[33:31.58]He thinks so little of us.
[33:43.89]Oh, a streamer pranks his chat by telling them to eat vegetables as a joke.
[33:54.46]Dude, let's, let's get it like trending, like hashtag eating well.
[34:15.74]coffee too.
[34:16.26]We'll be right back for real.
[34:18.44]Be back in like two minutes.
[37:22.29]Dude, you guys.
[37:25.30]When I was in the bathroom, I just thought of the funniest fucking thing ever.
[37:30.10]Dude, can you imagine if I, and even like you too potentially, right?
[37:37.85]Got like the daily recommended amount of fiber.
[37:44.07]What the fuck, dude?
[37:46.95]I was cracking up about it.
[37:54.78]Yeah, I know, right?
[37:55.76]It's so, like, goofy.
[38:06.37]Oh, yeah, dude.
[38:06.87]Healthy bowels?
[38:07.85]Y'all couldn't even imagine.
[38:09.07]Can you imagine how funny that would be?
[38:11.21]Okay, I need to use the scroll.
[38:16.25]I have enough to do something here.
[38:35.83]Let's do this one.
[38:36.55]Because I know this one's armor, yeah.
[38:39.63]So this is weapon.
[38:40.55]This is the sword.
[38:44.90]You ever finish Armored Core?
[38:46.02]I did not.
[38:48.88]I admittedly did not.
[38:51.02]Admittedly.
[38:58.94]I guess you can down rank if you want to, but we're not doing that.
[39:03.54]We're a real gamer.
[39:04.72]Alright, this is going to be a pretty good run.
[39:09.97]I can feel it.
[39:14.79]Yeah.
[39:16.61]Oh, whoops.
[39:22.03]Alright, try to go for this.
[39:25.65]Alright.
[39:26.59]Is it Stav?
[39:28.09]Stavs?
[39:28.85]Staves?
[39:30.64]Stavs?
[39:31.58]Stave.
[39:31.92]It's Staves, right?
[39:33.56]Staves.
[39:37.44]It's not Stavs.
[39:38.74]It's Staves.
[39:48.43]Yeah, Stave, yep.
[40:02.46]I saw one Omega Lull in there and I feel like that person thinks I was wrong.
[40:06.00]Am I wrong?
[40:09.05]And by the way, you're not allowed to think I'm wrong here.
[40:10.97]So we'll make sure we time that out and get rid of you.
[40:29.13]You can't pull out the Omega cringe.
[40:31.75]You can't even do that emote because a better TTV got disabled.
[40:36.39]So, uh, you can't even make that joke.
[40:51.50]Is it still alive?
[41:00.83]I gotta get this out quick.
[41:03.18]Just do it.
[41:04.52]Yeah, I think that was smart.
[41:05.96]So was this.
[41:06.40]Okay.
[41:10.78]Oh, shit.
[41:12.68]Big one.
[41:17.96]Good.
[41:18.50]Alright.
[41:19.39]Use a scroll.
[41:22.33]Good time to use it.
[41:25.01]I'm not going to lose after that.
[41:26.57]Oh, this is the next rank.
[41:27.45]There's the dragon.
[41:36.50]That was a good one.
[41:42.52]You should just devolve every stream and have the next one be like 800 by 600.
[41:45.62]I feel like we've done that before.
[41:50.59]I feel like that's happened at some point over the years.
[41:52.23]How much is that?
[41:53.83]200,000?
[41:53.85]No.
[41:53.91]Yeah.
[41:54.01]200,000 points already.
[41:54.43]10 million is not far from here.
[42:09.47]4x3.
[42:12.27]Oh.
[42:13.19]What is the resolution of this stream right now?
[42:17.12]Is it 1080?
[42:22.60]Guys.
[42:24.42]It's 1080.
[42:27.64]What happened?
[42:34.61]It's not 864p anymore.
[42:35.31]It's 1080p.
[42:41.83]Oh, it's because, yeah, I changed it.
[42:44.71]I mean, this is not the game to ask the question of.
[42:47.91]What's the max bitrate you can have on Twitch now?
[42:51.44]The reason why I never wanted to do higher than 720 ever was because the cap on bitrate was so low.
[43:03.20]At a 1080p, 60 FPS looked like such shit at like a 4, 5, 6 thousand bitrate.
[43:13.22]I'm gonna figure that out, because I could just bump the bitrate.
[43:16.39]And just, who gives a shit?
[43:19.61]I retired and my stream got better.
[43:35.04]Except the face cam.
[43:36.04]It got progressively worse over the years, yeah.
[43:39.54]I'd added the over the years, because that's me saying that.
[43:44.97]Dude, all webcams just suck, man.
[43:47.27]Like, they really just do.
[43:51.97]Every webcam just looks like shit.
[43:56.78]And I never gave a fuck to set up like a DSLR and point it at me and have the lighting with like ring lights and... No, no, don't look at me.
[44:11.40]Get away from me.
[44:18.46]Alright, no more staff.
[44:22.78]I think we're good on staff for now.
[44:25.28]You have a ring light, literally.
[44:26.74]Yeah, I know.
[44:27.38]I want the money.
[44:45.65]You look better with a good cam.
[44:53.82]Yeah, guys.
[44:58.49]I don't like cameras.
[45:03.23]Alright, 160 experience.
[45:12.60]Guys, cameras are for Disney World and colonoscopies.
[45:19.84]I don't want them anywhere else.
[45:25.57]Everybody's got a fucking camera.
[45:28.39]Put the camera down, okay?
[45:41.23]Yeah, for vacations and for medical purposes.
[46:11.63]Always eat the bread instantly.
[46:14.45]What about weddings?
[46:17.21]Yeah, okay.
[46:17.95]Well, that's another one.
[46:20.79]Would you count that as like a vacation?
[46:23.09]I mean, maybe?
[46:29.21]No.
[46:31.25]Okay, well, special event.
[46:33.59]A special event.
[46:36.46]That could mean anything.
[46:41.70]Special event could mean, you know, putting a birthday hat on Otto for his, like, 14th birthday.
[46:46.42]That is a special event.
[46:47.53]And, like, I'm taking a hundred pictures.
[46:49.71]So, shit.
[46:57.83]Got a lot of money for that.
[47:08.03]Please share them after.
[47:09.21]Nice.
[47:21.88]The crit chance is actually a huge deal in this game.
[47:24.74]Not even kidding.
[47:25.54]Okay.
[47:31.38]This is good to get up to.
[47:32.18]Hmm.
[47:38.29]I hum this.
[47:40.33]I've been humming this for a decade.
[47:41.55]That beginning part, the... Alright, 36 staves.
[47:45.89]Staves.
[47:46.45]Staves.
[47:47.20]Staves.
[47:47.44]30 tiles in 10 seconds.
[48:07.58]Alright, we're going all out for this one.
[48:30.41]Shit.
[48:41.99]That had to have been 30 tiles in 10 seconds, right?
[48:49.94]Uh, sometimes you have to just kind of sit your head back and just don't look at any individual tile.
[48:55.20]Just look at the entire map.
[49:02.37]Nothing ha- What?
[49:03.73]Nothing came out of that?
[49:10.39]Alright.
[49:11.55]Experience.
[49:13.35]I need more stabs.
[49:19.66]I'm sorry.
[49:28.88]I just thought of the, oh boy, in the video yesterday.
[49:31.86]It made me laugh.
[49:37.18]Oh boy.
[49:48.82]It's funny, like half of that video was me trying to make it as unbearable as possible.
[49:52.91]And the other half was like, I'm just eating mac and cheese for fun.
[49:55.15]I don't even care.
[49:55.71]I remember putting like sound effects in and being like, oh yeah, this is unbearable.
[50:02.58]People are going to think this is unbearable.
[50:04.95]I'm like, yeah, that sounds about right.
[50:16.31]Cheesy, wheezy, good.
[50:17.51]No, it's cheesy, wheezy, roney.
[50:19.37]From the old craft commercials.
[50:26.87]Those old craft commercials were like cracked out, by the way.
[50:38.40]That dinosaur.
[50:40.66]Talking about vacations.
[50:41.90]That dinosaur went on eight vacations per commercial.
[50:48.24]He'd be surfing and then like solving complex math problems on like a chalkboard to now he's skiing and now he's on a boat.
[51:01.96]He was always moving around.
[51:08.96]There was no CGI either.
[51:09.96]That was a real dinosaur, which is even more fucked up.
[51:23.47]I said, what are you talking about?
[51:27.36]Did you... You watched the stream yesterday, right?
[51:30.20]Did you not watch?
[51:35.02]Huh?
[51:37.12]Fuck, I thought that was a key.
[51:38.20]It was also metal.
[51:39.88]Duh!
[51:52.72]I got no keys.
[51:53.30]I got no keys.
[51:55.48]Please.
[51:59.22]I just don't see it.
[52:00.40]There's probably one right here and I just don't see it.
[52:02.26]I think it's over.
[52:14.54]For only two days only?
[52:15.55]Yeah.
[52:18.17]I have a lot of experience, but I'm going to do it again.
[52:20.11]What's going on?
[52:46.47]I'm quicker than this.
[52:49.61]Come on, man.
[52:50.29]I'm quicker than this.
[53:05.50]No!
[53:06.22]What the fuck?
[53:06.94]I didn't do it.
[53:07.86]Oh, that was a mistake.
[53:09.32]A big one.
[53:10.94]I tried to perfectly frame perfect time it and it was a disaster.
[53:26.57]What?
[53:29.13]You're playing Candy Crush for boys.
[53:40.72]Gwen.
[53:42.00]Come on, Gwen.
[53:56.11]Okay, this is much better.
[54:02.19]Very good.
[54:02.71]Alright, now I'm in the zone.
[54:07.81]Give me a chest.
[54:08.21]Chest.
[54:09.43]Chest.
[54:11.46]Chest.
[54:12.72]Look at how much I'm running.
[54:15.83]Not a chest, but it's okay.
[54:22.03]Alright, this is the one.
[54:22.61]This is going to be huge for sure.
[54:36.38]Look at this.
[54:36.68]I'm going to cross it.
[54:39.05]Yes!
[54:40.91]Uh, come on, come on, come on.
[54:41.57]Stay up there.
[54:43.94]You get so many more points if you're up there for a while.
[54:53.30]Got a lot of health.
[55:00.47]Just load it up with staffs.
[55:03.45]Good.
[55:08.10]Uh...
[55:10.36]Okay, chest.
[55:18.83]Key.
[55:19.47]Good.
[55:22.51]Another chest?
[55:24.21]No.
[55:29.35]Dragon coming up.
[55:30.01]There's no way I beat this dragon, but I'll be up here.
[55:33.95]Give me all the wood.
[55:37.77]Give me something insane.
[55:38.65]Come on.
[55:40.16]Huge, like, quadruple thing.
[55:41.46]Uh, nope.
[55:50.86]Grandpa hitting it on Bejeweled.
[55:52.38]You're not saying bingo every time.
[55:57.64]Yeah.
[56:06.36]Alright, run it again.
[56:07.32]Okay, one more and I'm going to go spend all this currency.
[56:12.88]I have a lot.
[56:26.57]If I get on a roll, I actually might get over three or four million on one of these.
[56:29.71]Alright, where should I spend it though?
[56:40.74]Go all in on staves.
[56:45.74]I need to open the fucking door.
[56:50.19]Open.
[56:50.65]Just open it.
[56:51.09]What am I doing?
[56:52.83]Oh my god.
[56:53.37]Good.
[57:08.97]I need more shields.
[57:10.25]Shields is next.
[57:13.51]You gotta lock in dude.
[57:14.45]I'm trying to lock in.
[57:15.19]I think I'm pretty locked in right now.
[57:31.31]You gotta lock in.
[57:33.91]Alright, that's a double.
[57:41.07]Dragon.
[57:45.09]Come on, chain it together.
[57:45.97]Die!
[57:54.58]Fuck.
[57:57.00]One day only, that's right.
[58:00.96]I'm not getting any of these two triple matches.
[58:05.10]Kill a ranged monster in under five seconds.
[58:07.42]Kill a ranged foe with only physical damage, okay?
[58:11.32]Alright, let's spend some money.
[58:17.94]Stretch time?
[58:19.90]Is it stretch time?
[58:21.94]Yeah, two minutes or so.
[58:23.06]After I spend this, I will.
[58:31.15]Hmm.
[58:33.29]Let me open these.
[58:33.97]Just get everything here.
[58:40.89]What is this one?
[58:43.09]Oh, this is just straight up damage reduction.
[58:48.00]What's this one?
[58:50.26]Thousand.
[58:56.98]I think it's shields.
[58:58.74]Shields.
[59:07.78]Okay, and then it's... I could do this again right now.
[59:10.34]No, save it.
[59:11.87]Save it.
[59:15.15]Three shields per match.
[59:16.27]This will probably go to four or five.
[59:17.91]Yeah.
[59:18.61]Let's do... I need max shields.
[59:23.84]Okay, 16 max shields.
[59:25.76]And then... Okay.
[59:27.94]Alright.
[59:28.14]Okay.
[59:28.44]Okay.
[59:39.32]Okay.
[59:40.30]I gotta kill this dragon.
[59:44.36]Are you in recliner or are you in your gaming bed?
[59:46.76]I'm in the recliner.
[59:47.42]Just hanging out.
[59:52.50]Oh, yeah.
[59:52.94]Stretch time.
[59:54.81]Alright.
[59:55.33]Stretch.
[59:57.63]Get up and move.
[59:59.21]At least me.
[60:00.81]It means you two.
[60:08.73]Your heart rate is really healthy.
[60:10.13]Like, I have a heart rate monitor on the screen.
[60:12.11]Okay, I'm up.
[60:23.80]I'm moving.
[60:28.44]Oh, 10 million beats per minute.
[60:37.84]We just said, hey, fucko, what game was that, buddy?
[60:44.76]It's 1-0, 0-0-0, 0-0-0.
[60:58.21]You know the game is going to come back in about one minute, right?
[61:03.41]I promise it'll be on the screen again.
[61:05.13]What if it just wasn't?
[61:18.95]I would hate to have a heart rate monitor because having the heart rate monitor would make my heart rate go up because I know you're looking at it.
[61:26.75]So you simply knowing that it's there is going to increase my beats per minute by at least 10 to 20.
[61:40.79]Me just knowing it's activated.
[61:46.65]Like, when you go to the doctor, and you get the, um, the blood pressure test, you know, they put the, you know, they test your blood pressure, and you desperately, when they put it on, are like, you're mentally trying to make your body have low blood pressure.
[62:03.14]It's like, okay, it's on, okay, time to just relax, focus on being a healthy person.
[62:12.71]I am wicked healthy right now, and I'm like relaxed.
[62:15.66]This number better be good.
[62:22.20]You try to like use telekinesis to make your blood pressure normal.
[62:44.10]Let's get back to it.
[62:50.05]Trying to manifest a better blood pressure.
[62:58.46]An IQ monitor.
[63:02.42]Okay, an IQ monitor would be actually really funny because you could pull up various YouTube videos or like, you know, TikToks or whatever streams or eat certain things or do certain things and then you could see it lower and raise.
[63:18.73]I could sit there and read a book
[63:21.20]And like the IQ points go up one or two.
[63:24.66]And then when I'm describing the book to you of what I just read, three or four come down off of it.
[63:32.79]Oh, that's actually a funny idea.
[63:34.47]I could sneeze really loud and 10 IQ points are gone.
[63:45.91]Eat like a bowl of oatmeal and it goes up one.
[63:47.61]That sounds fun.
[63:53.95]IQ monitor.
[63:57.45]Just put on NASA videos and just sit there staring, just like.
[64:00.65]And it goes down because I don't get it.
[64:06.13]I don't understand what I'm looking at.
[64:19.50]That sounds like something a streamer who isn't retired would say.
[64:21.98]Well, it's too bad.
[64:24.05]Too bad it's not going to be me.
[64:25.17]Alright, I'm leveled up.
[64:30.63]I got more shields now.
[64:31.87]I'm happy.
[64:42.86]I can have, what?
[64:43.76]16, was it?
[64:52.33]Oh, there's so many options that I just can't see any of them.
[64:55.69]There are so many options, I just can't see them.
[65:09.69]Come on.
[65:10.87]Oh my goodness.
[65:13.69]Oh my goodness.
[65:14.41]It's a disaster.
[65:22.80]Keys, keys, keys, keys, keys.
[65:27.49]Keys.
[65:28.45]Keys, please.
[65:33.23]Okay.
[65:43.63]Shit.
[65:51.70]Uh...
[65:54.48]uh oh come on good good oh
[66:18.34]keys unlock stuff they do you get three keys that is one lock some things have two locks on them would you trade five iq points for impeccable mobility that's a tough question because I don't know where I I the losing those five iq points could put me down like a full iq level tax bracket you know what I mean by that
[66:45.86]Like, if I go, I don't want to go under, like, an IQ tax bracket.
[66:50.58]Like, what if I hit a point where, oh, fuck, those five IQ points were the only, I, now I have lost a massive step because I was right on the cusp.
[67:09.33]Like, is going from 125 IQ.
[67:11.95]Let's be honest.
[67:14.44]Actually, it's probably, like, way lower, but... I've had it tested before.
[67:18.68]You guys don't know.
[67:22.24]I don't... How many times... I'm not going to tell the same story a thousand times.
[67:32.97]I want more shields.
[67:36.14]Well, let's, okay, let's just say that I, what is average, right?
[67:40.64]Average is considered what?
[67:41.54]Somewhere between high 80, like 85 to like 105?
[67:43.30]Like 90 to 100?
[67:43.56]100 to like 90 is like considered pretty average, right?
[67:45.50]Like 100?
[67:53.92]Yeah, I always thought like 105, if you were 105, it's like, oh shit, okay.
[68:00.78]105.
[68:01.86]So if losing five IQ points brings you from 105, which is just barely over the average, back to average, would you feel it?
[68:10.41]That's what I would be concerned about.
[68:11.49]So I don't know if I would trade it.
[68:18.53]Might as well do this once.
[68:33.07]deal 10% win damage okay I like that thorns this is good too I think I like that I feel like it's very important it's expensive but
[68:59.80]What about 5 IQ for some good fish broth?
[69:08.43]I mean, I don't, that's kind of like... It's kind of like a dog mentality.
[69:15.81]Right?
[69:18.73]Like, if I told Otto, Otto, I'll give you a delicious treat if you lose 5 IQ points, he's not even going to hear the second part.
[69:26.08]He's going to go, treat!
[69:26.64]Yes!
[69:27.24]Yes!
[69:29.52]So, I don't know.
[69:30.44]I don't think I would do it for food.
[69:50.71]Oh fuck, I was reading chat.
[69:58.24]I can bring this.
[70:01.24]I can do it.
[70:01.86]I can do it.
[70:04.38]It's gonna be a chest right after.
[70:05.60]Yep.
[70:07.92]Oh, no.
[70:08.44]No, I'm good.
[70:08.78]I'm alright.
[70:09.08]I'm okay.
[70:12.91]I'm good.
[70:14.95]So many options.
[70:15.55]Which one?
[70:17.03]Oh, there's so many options.
[70:17.87]What do I do?
[70:22.25]Fuck!
[70:22.73]I didn't mean to click that.
[70:23.61]I did, but you know what I mean.
[70:32.90]Shit.
[70:33.22]Okay.
[70:40.45]That was a bad run.
[70:41.11]That was a bad one.
[70:41.81]Do it again.
[70:42.99]That was a bad one.
[70:43.55]200,000.
[70:49.64]I can do that.
[70:51.14]Good start.
[71:08.58]Good start.
[71:09.54]Don't blow it here.
[71:11.64]Oh, I'm gonna blow it.
[71:20.45]Shit!
[71:37.14]Everything's too spread out.
[71:42.02]Okay, there we go.
[71:42.66]Okay, I pulled it back.
[72:04.85]Good.
[72:12.49]Good.
[72:26.91]Do it!
[72:30.41]I got a five in a row right here.
[72:32.29]Don't blow that.
[72:32.97]Okay.
[72:56.68]No, I got it.
[72:57.32]I got it.
[72:57.56]I got it.
[72:57.76]I got it.
[72:57.96]I got the kill.
[72:58.36]I got the kill.
[72:59.12]I got the kill.
[72:59.50]I counted.
[73:00.28]I got the kill.
[73:01.92]Stop gulping?
[73:02.70]What do you mean?
[73:03.64]What do you mean stop gulping?
[73:08.57]Oh, okay.
[73:09.05]I see what you mean.
[73:10.03]I thought I was like into the bike all the time and you've waited this long to tell me?
[73:16.69]I killed the dragon though.
[73:17.99]I counted right at the end.
[73:21.90]I really thought that I was doing that.
[73:33.26]Alright, I got money to spend.
[73:34.51]I killed the dragon.
[73:45.99]Chain pass 5.
[73:47.81]Items do, oh yeah, way more damage.
[73:49.90]I want that.
[73:50.42]What's that?
[73:58.98]20... That's it?! !
[74:03.88]Guess I made the crit better, but not by very- that was expensive for a whole lot of nothing.
[74:15.43]Favorite soda?
[74:18.29]You know, it's funny you bring that up.
[74:21.91]You know what I've been drinking lately that I've actually really liked?
[74:24.29]You guys- you guys heard Olipop?
[74:36.89]It's pretty good.
[74:39.84]Most of their sodas have... It's... I cannot explain to you exactly what's in it.
[74:44.79]It's all kinds of like plant fiber.
[74:47.89]This could be completely wrong.
[74:49.08]I have no idea.
[74:51.81]It's got a bunch of like prebiotics and I mainly drank it because it just has less sugar and it I don't want to drink a diet soda.
[75:00.88]I think there's like four or five grams of sugar in each can, which if you look at the back of a regular Coke or something, it's like fucking 30 something.
[75:14.71]But if it wasn't a more healthy soda, would I use that term very, very loosely?
[75:20.47]Because I don't know if you can ever say that.
[75:26.30]I don't know.
[75:28.96]It depends on the day.
[75:40.59]Coke is great.
[75:43.48]I'm definitely more Coke than I am Pepsi.
[75:52.52]Coke has that bite.
[75:55.73]Pepsi doesn't have the bite that Coke does.
[75:57.51]Not going to do it?
[76:04.63]That's alright.
[76:12.01]10 doubles.
[76:13.47]I still have to do this one.
[76:14.31]Let's do it again.
[76:19.24]Game is 10 million.
[76:20.76]It's on Steam right now.
[76:21.76]You can check it out.
[76:23.36]It's a very old game.
[76:25.44]I got the urge to play it recently.
[76:26.88]I was like, you know what?
[76:29.45]Might as well just stream it because I felt like playing it.
[76:32.97]And the stream was right here.
[76:34.17]And I'm like, you know what?
[76:34.81]I just feel like doing it.
[76:37.15]That's what we're doing.
[76:46.22]Dr. Pepper's the best.
[76:47.56]Dr. Pepper is the best.
[76:52.38]To me, objectively speaking, I think it's my favorite soda.
[76:57.40]But... But... I think that there is a place for all the other ones.
[77:08.01]And drinking the same soda forever is kind of dull.
[77:16.18]And I want a little variety.
[77:36.14]Once you get that five million chain is when you go, holy shit, I just beat the game in one minute.
[77:43.17]Oh, fuck.
[77:44.19]I need to do this.
[77:44.93]I need to clear that.
[77:46.63]Okay.
[77:58.03]Good.
[77:59.66]Good.
[77:59.90]I have so many keys.
[78:05.96]Oh, shit.
[78:18.98]Fuck!
[78:19.54]Actually angry.
[78:20.34]Okay, I got money.
[78:23.34]$370,000 out of $10,000,000.
[78:28.67]Alright, let's open up this one.
[78:45.51]You ever beat this game?
[78:46.23]A long, long time ago.
[78:48.13]Plus 50% stone and wood, but no experience.
[78:58.95]Plus 25% chance to critical or special strike, but you do overall less damage.
[79:05.87]Plus 15% to the score, but chests have an extra lock now.
[79:12.73]Um...
[79:16.08]Probably this one.
[79:23.07]I need more base damage.
[79:34.74]That'd be 30% chance to crit.
[79:37.72]This would be... Is this technically a crit?
[79:40.82]I think the poison is technically a crit.
[80:02.03]Let's do the thorns.
[80:03.25]That sounds good.
[80:10.62]Stretch break?
[80:11.22]Not yet.
[80:11.62]Still kind of early for that.
[80:14.22]10 minutes or so.
[80:17.18]Alright, kill a monster using only orbs, eat an item of food just before timeout, or match 26 backpack tires.
[80:22.85]This one's going to be... Not easy, but, you know.
[80:28.75]This one will be hard to do.
[80:29.59]I want to free up some space.
[80:49.71]Okay.
[80:52.94]I want weapons.
[80:54.06]I don't really want keys.
[80:55.16]Okay, there we go.
[80:56.30]I could do that.
[80:58.08]So I have to eat that right before I lose.
[80:59.66]To get the quest.
[81:04.74]Fuck, I wanted that.
[81:05.66]Okay, good run, good run, good run, good run.
[81:20.55]I want to get rid of this.
[81:36.78]Okay.
[81:40.10]Okay, I got two pieces of food.
[81:51.17]mmm good shit kill him kill him oops oh come on come on come on come on I ate the food you idiot why did I do that
[82:38.77]Oh, God damn it.
[82:39.55]I killed him again.
[82:40.41]I just killed him again at the very end.
[82:42.47]You saw that.
[82:44.23]I just got the kill confirmed, but I didn't walk by him so I don't get to win.
[82:48.28]Fuck.
[82:51.64]It's okay.
[82:52.12]I got points for it.
[82:52.70]Remember when you liked Pilk?
[82:57.52]I tried Pilk.
[82:58.46]I didn't like it.
[82:59.10]I did not like it.
[83:06.66]I just said it was alright.
[83:17.66]I took a sip and I was like, alright, this is like weird, but.
[83:19.90]Um.
[83:26.26]Yeah.
[83:30.68]Alright, I'm getting my ass kicked.
[83:35.88]I need more shield material, maybe shield size.
[83:42.63]I'm getting my ass kicked.
[84:04.26]Just open it.
[84:14.72]That crit damage thing is awesome, but it needs to hit.
[84:17.73]Otherwise you do almost nothing.
[84:28.27]Okay, give me a chest.
[84:28.89]Give me two chests in a row.
[84:36.17]Give me two chests in a row.
[84:42.52]Give me a second chest in a row.
[84:45.72]Sorry.
[85:15.49]It's a big one.
[85:16.01]Fucking die!
[85:35.96]Shit!
[85:45.40]I had the whole screen.
[85:46.78]I had the whole screen.
[85:48.46]I couldn't kill him.
[85:49.34]Shit.
[85:55.00]God damn it.
[86:01.50]You suck, Grandma.
[86:07.03]I'll get back to you.
[86:07.83]Grandpa gave me.
[86:18.74]That's gonna help.
[86:27.34]Ancient memes.
[86:29.67]Ancient memes.
[86:47.90]Alright.
[86:48.34]Remind me not to use orbs.
[86:50.90]Because I just... The second I have them, I get rid of them.
[86:52.96]I need to kill a monster with only orbs.
[86:54.58]So I need to save up on orbs.
[86:56.42]Okay, there's one.
[87:09.51]And I'll see you guys tomorrow when I do my full Silent Mist playthrough.
[87:37.45]I want a ball.
[87:46.47]Oh.
[87:47.53]Wait.
[87:48.15]Shit.
[87:48.53]Does it have to kill the monster using only orbs?
[87:51.46]I think I fucked it up.
[87:52.48]I think I already attacked.
[87:53.24]Alright.
[87:56.06]I can't do any damage.
[87:57.00]It has to be only orbs.
[87:59.14]I got it.
[88:10.43]Come on.
[88:18.38]What am I doing?
[88:20.02]What am I doing?
[88:21.74]What am I doing?
[88:22.30]I froze.
[88:35.05]Does that count?
[88:37.63]For this?
[88:37.93]I wonder.
[88:39.49]I wonder.
[88:43.06]Nice.
[88:43.32]Okay, I got it.
[88:44.00]Ooh, I got them both.
[88:55.67]Alright, let me spend it somewhere good.
[89:03.80]I can almost upgrade this again.
[89:05.08]Alright.
[89:07.48]What am I lacking?
[89:08.30]Hey, chat.
[89:09.98]What am I lacking?
[89:10.70]Hey, chat.
[89:21.48]Damage.
[89:24.16]IQ.
[89:28.90]Okay.
[89:29.66]What else?
[89:30.62]I'm talking about in the game.
[89:31.76]The context of 10 million.
[89:35.54]Oh, stretch time.
[89:39.96]Stretch time, that's right.
[89:46.43]1.30.
[89:46.45]It's time to get up.
[90:06.69]It's only 12.
[90:07.93]Yeah, it is.
[90:10.43]Make stretching funny, then I'll do it.
[90:14.23]Okay.
[90:15.17]Can you imagine if you stood up right now and put... I can't even get it out.
[90:22.20]It's too funny.
[90:23.60]And you kind of squatted down to like squat down to not have your butt touch the floor, but just kind of almost there and then push up in a repetition.
[90:38.92]Go down a second time, like squat up and then push up with your legs.
[90:47.22]Oh my god, everyone's fucking cracking up.
[90:51.15]Jeez, that's so fucking funny.
[90:53.67]I'm doing it right now and it's funny.
[91:11.79]We got the one thing I'm on this stream.
[91:15.19]You know I'm gonna do it like five more times.
[91:21.62]Get jacked for content.
[91:26.10]No, I don't think so.
[91:34.85]You already did that?
[91:35.63]I feel like I got jacked for me.
[91:56.93]Do it again, but for content this time.
[91:58.87]No.
[92:00.17]I don't give a shit about anything for content this time.
[92:04.80]I'm not... You know what?
[92:07.34]I will eat vegetables for content.
[92:23.23]Alright, let me go pee.
[92:25.82]I've had two coffees, so give me one sec.
[94:01.41]Hello.
[94:02.87]He didn't stream for so long, his BTTV reset.
[94:16.48]Yeah, it did.
[94:20.31]That is a true statement.
[94:29.77]And I'll do it again, too.
[94:40.27]Okay.
[94:40.45]I feel like I'm about to get on a roll here.
[94:43.52]Uh, I'm gonna wait till I can do that one.
[94:51.66]I need one dollar.
[94:53.08]I'm gonna get one dollar.
[95:03.11]This smug motherfucker right here has been... I've killed him twice.
[95:17.80]Alright.
[95:18.70]Only kill with an orb.
[95:20.22]So I need at least two or three of them.
[95:39.52]Good?
[95:39.76]Okay.
[95:40.76]I should be able to do it in two.
[95:43.40]As long as it's a shitty enemy.
[95:49.29]Mmm.
[95:51.03]Yes.
[95:51.35]Okay, there it is.
[96:10.30]Mmm.
[96:11.38]There we go.
[96:17.75]What?
[96:18.79]That did not even half.
[96:29.00]I need a key.
[96:31.38]Oh my goodness, so many keys just fell out of the sky and I didn't even utilize them.
[96:46.79]Come on, kill him.
[96:55.09]shit good that was a five of a kind right there too I just blew it
[97:29.74]Oh, shit.
[97:32.30]I'm out of things to do.
[97:40.58]Talk about seltzer.
[97:41.62]Why is it so fizzy?
[97:43.74]Well, here's the thing.
[97:45.61]There's something called carbonation.
[97:48.87]And when you put enough carbonation into something, bubbles, gas tries to escape the water constantly.
[97:56.03]It's fucking crazy.
[98:01.58]Alright, this is the sword.
[98:03.20]Sword's not the best.
[98:18.20]It also reduces the ability to absorb calcium into your brain.
[98:23.10]Um... I, I, oh, okay.
[98:38.20]Who the fuck said that?
[98:41.82]Oh no, you said gas.
[98:42.92]Alright, kill a monster in a single hit.
[98:47.38]Probably gonna take a little while to do that one.
[98:49.82]What do I have for points?
[98:52.84]480,000.
[98:55.52]Stay alive for two minutes.
[98:57.06]Okay, let me get all these right now.
[99:03.62]Start off with an immediate kill.
[99:22.41]I got a feeling this is gonna be a good one.
[99:48.94]Oh big.
[99:57.33]Fuck, there was four right there.
[100:13.72]I just ate it.
[100:15.62]Yeah, no shit.
[100:16.24]We can watch.
[100:16.94]We can see.
[100:20.08]Hey guys, I just ate it.
[100:21.70]Okay.
[100:22.38]Anything else?
[100:23.10]Nah, that's it.
[100:40.88]Okay, I'm getting close to the dragon.
[101:07.88]Yes!
[101:08.76]Alright, we got it.
[101:16.26]Nice, okay.
[101:17.19]That's good.
[101:19.25]Now we're at the next rank.
[101:21.57]We're at what?
[101:22.65]600,000?
[101:22.69]Holy shit, that was a lot.
[101:32.05]Oh, check this out.
[101:45.72]running out of things ah it's okay alright that was a big one I got tons of materials now do you like fresco I actually do fresco is pretty good
[102:15.17]I like Fresca as like a wine.
[102:18.61]You know, like a few times a year.
[102:20.97]Like, oh yeah, I'll take a wine at dinner.
[102:22.77]Yeah.
[102:22.87]That sounds amazing.
[102:26.23]I need more damage, for sure.
[102:35.86]Mmm...
[102:45.24]29, 38.
[102:46.50]Okay.
[102:47.90]So now I'm going to level up the blacksmith.
[102:52.88]Okay.
[102:55.00]1600 gold gets us to very damaging levels.
[103:09.07]Kill seven monsters.
[103:10.12]I should be able to do that.
[103:11.60]Single hit and only orbs.
[103:13.04]Okay.
[103:15.67]We need a serious auto update.
[103:18.71]Auto is doing good.
[103:21.98]He's getting a little older.
[103:23.04]So he is 14.
[103:24.90]He's getting up there.
[103:29.50]He has a little bit of arthritis.
[103:32.28]In his, I think one of his paws.
[103:36.12]But he's on a medication for it.
[103:37.68]He's on a couple different medications.
[103:39.00]Just he has Addison's and you guys already know that.
[103:43.21]But he's doing good.
[103:43.91]He's doing, he's happy.
[103:45.13]He's healthy.
[103:47.90]I think he's going to stick around for a pretty long time.
[103:49.76]He's, he's, he's very healthy.
[103:51.78]I would say I got his weight down.
[103:58.02]He's at his ideal weight, which is good.
[104:11.28]Oh my God.
[104:11.76]What am I doing?
[104:14.62]Yeah, he was a little chunky.
[104:16.00]I'm not gonna lie.
[104:17.34]Alright, this is a good start.
[104:39.79]All that for nothing?
[104:41.25]I feel like there should have been a lot more.
[104:56.56]Okay.
[105:12.78]Fall.
[105:16.50]Fall.
[105:20.26]Five of kind.
[105:21.78]Nice.
[105:26.36]Cool.
[105:27.04]Cool.
[105:27.16]Alright.
[105:27.70]Cheese.
[105:35.36]Shit.
[105:35.79]I need this.
[105:44.11]That would be huge if I can actually pull this off.
[105:45.75]Come on.
[105:47.58]Come on.
[105:49.88]Oh, there's no keys.
[105:50.80]Ah.
[106:00.34]Alright, 650,000.
[106:00.92]If you don't win this game at least once, the only win condition is to have 10 million points.
[106:14.36]Each one of these runs is trying to get to 10 million points.
[106:23.99]This game is really addicting.
[106:25.11]It is.
[106:27.52]And I don't even know why.
[106:28.30]I just had this sudden urge to play it.
[106:31.08]This is not even today.
[106:31.80]This is... I want to say like a week ago.
[106:38.55]Something about it was just in my brain.
[106:41.81]You should play that game 10 million.
[106:43.59]I was like, I guess I'll listen to your brain.
[106:57.14]Alright, good start.
[107:02.10]10 million gamer.
[107:10.83]It looks really fun.
[107:11.61]Yeah, I want to play it after watching.
[107:14.57]I would say there's a sequel to this too.
[107:19.26]The sequel is kind of doesn't feel like it's connected.
[107:22.10]It's called You Must Build a Boat.
[107:25.90]So the sequel is not 20 million.
[107:28.26]It is You Must Build a Boat.
[107:31.33]And... You Build a Boat.
[107:35.21]Is the direct sequel to 10 million.
[107:36.83]It's a classic.
[107:55.12]How did that one go so poorly?
[108:04.53]I think you would like Screamo.
[108:13.84]Screamo the type of music, or Screamo the often-forgotten Marvel character?
[108:38.77]Yeah, Dave Stevenson, also known as Screamo.
[108:43.29]His mutant power is he can scream really loud.
[108:50.43]He was in like two, I think he was only in like two editions of, you know, Marvel Super War.
[109:14.32]Yeah, you know it's automatically a fake thing with a fake story and it means nothing.
[109:20.85]If I use the last name Stevenson, that is the guarantee that this is made up.
[109:28.39]No matter what the scenario is.
[109:35.69]Dave, if anybody in this community was named Dave Stevenson, holy shit.
[109:40.25]This is a personal stream for you.
[109:42.57]We talk about you all the time.
[109:50.83]It's just the go-to, I'm making a person up.
[109:55.37]It's just easy to have the same one.
[109:57.23]Five of a kind, that should do it.
[110:16.60]It didn't!
[110:17.30]I gotta take off the crit thing.
[110:19.96]I'm not a big fan of the crit thing anymore.
[110:25.03]And I used to be.
[110:25.79]I was a huge fan of the crit thing.
[110:36.30]I'm dead.
[110:42.04]Oh, that's a lot.
[110:44.06]I got 2000 gold.
[110:46.84]We got to make this stuff deadly.
[110:50.36]There we go.
[110:50.92]Alright.
[110:51.24]This is expensive, but this should be a lot.
[110:53.14]We have actually pretty big increase.
[110:55.24]Yeah.
[110:58.06]Any new potions?
[111:02.36]Uh-huh.
[111:04.34]20% of wood and stone as gold.
[111:08.06]I actually like that.
[111:08.75]Okay.
[111:10.45]You don't get any more wood and stone anymore.
[111:12.21]I don't really need it right now.
[111:22.41]Name of the game?
[111:23.39]Ten million.
[111:31.49]That attack delay is a big deal too.
[111:32.83]Alright, I got a lot of experience.
[111:38.33]Thousand, one thousand?
[111:39.21]Alright, let's do it.
[111:43.78]Just pin a comment with the... Yeah, maybe that's a good idea.
[111:46.16]Because I have it set to games and demos.
[111:48.66]It doesn't say ten million.
[111:49.54]Because at some point...
[111:53.04]I was going to show off withering rooms.
[112:00.01]Start a run with half shield and strength.
[112:02.83]Half shield.
[112:03.35]Oh, okay.
[112:05.95]This is a big deal.
[112:06.63]And this is actually, this is a huge deal.
[112:08.27]Let's get them both.
[112:14.31]Grants a larger time bonus when opening a chest.
[112:19.30]Cost reductions.
[112:20.30]Yeah, this is 50% more food effect.
[112:22.96]That's a big deal.
[112:24.62]Alright, let's go.
[112:32.04]I'm not going to get any more wood.
[112:33.02]Is that a problem?
[112:36.53]Nah, I want to upgrade weapons.
[112:42.57]Take the crit off.
[112:43.91]Is it off?
[112:44.23]I think it turned it off.
[112:47.75]Yeah, I'll take the money one.
[112:51.04]Oh shit, you can have more than one active at a time.
[112:52.72]Okay.
[112:52.96]Alright.
[112:56.16]What about plus 50% stone and wood and 20% of that stone and wood is gold.
[113:02.88]So I'll just make a ton of money.
[113:05.00]Let's do it.
[113:11.18]Don't listen to the haters.
[113:12.14]I love this game.
[113:15.22]I don't see very... I don't see... What do you mean haters?
[113:18.92]Haters?
[113:19.92]Who hates 10 million?
[113:31.50]Me.
[113:42.47]Alright, come on.
[113:45.05]Good start.
[113:56.70]I lost a lot of time there, but whatever.
[113:58.43]I turns crits off, right?
[114:10.72]Yeah, I did.
[114:18.62]Good, OK.
[114:31.12]Chest.
[114:31.36]Yep.
[114:45.01]Just setting some stuff up.
[114:46.39]Just set it up.
[114:47.01]Um...
[115:01.67]Uh, keys.
[115:06.71]Good.
[115:07.81]Key, free door.
[115:23.95]Too much stone and wood.
[115:31.36]Do you still play games off stream?
[115:33.94]Yeah, I told you guys yesterday that I have... I have like a thousand clips.
[115:38.48]Mostly from every Dark Souls game.
[115:53.05]Yeah, the amount of Xbox record that.
[115:57.15]moments that have happened in the last two to three years of just randomly playing things off stream there's a whole compilation to be made and one of these days I'm just gonna go live one day and be like hey here's a Dark Souls 2 compilation let's just watch it
[116:28.95]I took way too many hits here.
[116:33.21]You just do clip shows now.
[116:35.77]Yeah, we just do clip shows and watch.
[116:39.85]10 million.
[116:42.55]And Withering Rooms.
[116:44.80]Jerma's game of the year so far.
[116:47.40]You heard that correct.
[116:49.32]You did not hear things differently.
[116:51.60]Jerma985 has claimed Withering Rooms as current game of the year.
[117:00.95]What does he mean by that?
[117:03.09]If you stay tuned long enough, maybe you'll know.
[117:16.44]It's the funniest movie of the year.
[117:20.36]I'm glad somebody picked up on that.
[117:23.98]Critics are saying it's the funniest movie of the year.
[117:27.73]Laugh out loud.
[117:49.38]No!
[117:55.75]No!
[117:55.83]Wasn't that like a whole thing where... I forget that whole routine.
[118:01.01]Wasn't it like Bernie Sanders was saying it or something?
[118:04.61]Like, it's... Oh, and Bernie Sanders has this to say.
[118:06.99]Like, the movie was great.
[118:08.46]I thought Sonic the Hedgehog was funny.
[118:10.00]I forget the whole joke.
[118:24.43]Yeah, it's the funniest movie of the year routine.
[118:26.93]I was talking about Sonic the Hedgehog coming to theaters.
[118:43.83]Oh no, it was like, it was like, I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message.
[118:47.99]And then it was like, it's the funniest movie of the year.
[118:51.63]We were making a joke of like, if a politician started endorsing like movies and like TV shows.
[119:00.58]That's what it was.
[119:08.11]Are you going to go see the Garfield movie?
[119:11.01]What year is it?
[119:15.31]Did I wake up in 2015?
[119:19.05]What year is it?
[119:19.63]Is there a Garfield movie I don't know about?
[119:28.01]Why do they keep making Garfield stuff?
[119:31.31]Is there like a huge appetite for Garfield?
[119:37.61]How am I not seeing anything?
[119:58.22]Yeah, maybe I miss it.
[119:58.98]I don't remember there being such an appetite for Garfield.
[120:02.24]Although I don't pay that much attention anymore.
[120:16.47]Airplane food bit?
[120:17.73]What do you mean?
[120:20.29]What, me saying, like, Garfield?
[120:22.41]How can it be?
[120:22.97]No, I don't understand.
[120:24.55]What do you mean?
[120:25.15]Like, me saying Garfield?
[120:31.05]Are you saying like it's a what's the deal with Garfield?
[120:34.14]I guess that, okay, you could say that about anything though.
[120:38.60]What's the deal with dot dot dot and then whatever the topic is.
[120:42.20]Like you could make, what are you talking about?
[120:46.08]What's the deal with 10 million?
[120:54.75]What's the deal?
[120:58.41]Go on, somebody said.
[121:07.20]Okay, but what is the deal with Garfield?
[121:09.84]I know, sometimes it makes sense to ask that question.
[121:16.17]Yeah, what is the deal with Garfield?
[121:18.17]Did somebody explain it to me?
[121:21.23]What is the deal with Garfield?
[121:25.21]I guess he's a funny cat and he likes lasagna and he's funny and he's...
[121:31.80]Doesn't do anything fucked up or anything.
[121:33.44]He's just kind of like a funny cat that eats.
[121:36.90]I could see the, you know, the marketing appeal for... Oh, I blew that.
[121:48.43]Does Garfield ever drive a car?
[122:01.17]It's very important for me to know.
[122:04.19]Does Garfield drive a car at any point in any of these movies?
[122:13.38]Garfield car?
[122:13.98]No, no, I mean in a main series, Garfield.
[122:18.83]Does he drive a car?
[122:31.69]I think I'm not getting any definitive answers here.
[122:50.81]Ooh, yep.
[122:53.33]It'd be a full letter grade, yeah.
[123:05.33]That's it?
[123:06.77]I only got like three staves.
[123:39.22]Mmm, shit.
[123:41.22]Just open it.
[123:44.24]I want less keys.
[123:46.74]And more weapons.
[123:55.11]He's kicking my ass.
[123:59.11]Oh, just barely.
[124:06.57]Jeez, OK.
[124:11.24]Alright, saved.
[124:17.70]I got nothing.
[124:19.64]I got nothing.
[124:27.55]Good.
[124:33.09]Two keys, shit.
[124:36.71]I'm freaking out.
[124:37.61]I'm panicking.
[124:40.18]I've panicked.
[124:42.42]I panicked.
[124:43.00]I couldn't do it.
[124:43.44]Time to stretch.
[124:51.06]Thank you.
[124:53.16]Once it gets to 1 million, you can snowball.
[125:09.96]Staff material after this.
[125:12.70]Yep.
[125:17.10]Alright.
[125:17.93]Scratch.
[125:24.27]Are you still using the Razor Death Adder?
[125:26.69]Uh, yes I am.
[125:30.08]I still use that.
[125:40.72]I got, um... I got the big-ass hands.
[125:45.59]And when I put my hand on a regular mouse, I feel like it's just... It's uncomfortable.
[125:51.33]I don't like it.
[126:11.02]Why do you... What are you saying?
[126:21.28]Can you read us a poem?
[126:22.86]Uh, sure.
[126:24.42]A, B, C, D, E, F, G... Is the alphabet a poem?
[126:28.80]Technically.
[126:29.90]Is it a song?
[126:30.44]A poem?
[126:31.44]Which one?
[126:36.58]A, B, C, D, E, F, G...
[126:40.57]Now I know my ABCs, next time won't you sing with me.
[126:44.80]That's poetry.
[127:05.71]Yeah, the one that goes A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, uh, L, P, Q, U, V, W. It goes something like that.
[127:26.25]I haven't heard that band in a long time, so I don't know the lyrics that much.
[127:42.19]U-R-S.
[127:58.92]I'm scratching.
[128:14.55]Moving around.
[128:22.00]I really loved that stream.
[128:25.88]But me getting shit-faced in VR and... making a fool out of myself?
[128:32.59]Me too.
[128:44.84]Is that the same stream where I was like, no, no, you don't understand.
[128:48.41]Yeah.
[128:48.71]Hey guys, I'm going to make my own convention.
[128:51.17]I'm going to make my own convention.
[128:53.29]Okay.
[128:57.46]Okay, dude.
[129:20.09]Now, I would walk into the Jerma convention, and I would look around at everything that has been made, and I would freeze.
[129:28.50]And I would go, oh my god, is it still time for me to back out of this?
[129:34.72]Do I still have time to back out?
[129:37.48]I need to back out.
[129:38.51]I need, this needs to stop now.
[129:39.93]I need to back out of this.
[129:44.25]I would just look around and be like, this, this is, this needs, this needs to end.
[129:53.03]That's before anybody even stepped foot inside.
[130:15.03]I'm not even talking about people attending.
[130:18.45]That's a whole other can of worms.
[130:21.93]People walking around with like Sasugai face cutouts.
[130:27.16]Oh no.
[130:28.54]Oh, what have I done?
[130:48.80]I mean, that would be a really funny video, I think.
[130:50.58]That would be like a funny... Sorry, I'm like leaning over.
[130:52.68]I'm still stretching.
[130:55.00]That would be a pretty funny video.
[130:57.28]Like a content creator makes a convention around themselves and they realize it was the worst fucking thing they ever did.
[131:04.52]It's like, oh shit.
[131:06.12]Wait a minute.
[131:06.60]No, no, no, no.
[131:07.42]Wait.
[131:08.20]Why does the drinking fountain have to have my face on it?
[131:12.06]Why is it like eight different Jerma-flavored sodas at the fountain over there?
[131:17.04]Why did I do this?
[131:23.12]Like one of the flavors is coffee cheetos chicken.
[131:25.87]Everyone's drinking it.
[131:26.79]It's like, whoa, try it.
[131:31.39]I just go over there and just rip the cords out of the back.
[131:34.23]No, no, no.
[131:35.01]Everybody has to go home.
[131:36.47]Everybody has to go home right now.
[131:50.92]Alright, sitting back down.
[132:02.26]Do it with all paid actors.
[132:06.54]Or like, hey, have a drone shot or a very high crane angle shot of zoomed in.
[132:14.46]And it looks like there's a bunch of people around me.
[132:17.67]Outside.
[132:18.37]Outside the venue.
[132:20.39]Hey, we're at JermaCon and we are so excited to say, and I kind of look around like, hey everybody, it's time to do the thing that we just rehearsed for a while.
[132:30.74]And it pulls out and there's like five people in the entire crowd.
[132:36.82]We had fun at JermaCon.
[132:55.96]And those five people, yeah, those five people are duplicated with CGI a few times.
[133:00.94]And I walk through one of them.
[133:04.30]I walk through one of them.
[133:11.91]Hey, is the music still alright?
[133:13.21]You guys still into the music?
[133:15.83]I know it's the same, like four or five tracks, but they are good.
[133:22.35]They are good songs.
[133:29.02]Alright, I want more money.
[133:34.38]Yeah, everybody say it!
[133:36.44]Call your mother!
[133:37.74]I don't know if I can do that.
[133:48.57]Oh, man.
[133:49.17]No.
[134:02.18]Just thinking about it is making my skin crawl.
[134:21.95]I need keys!
[134:31.37]This is a bad start.
[134:33.19]I want to start over.
[134:38.07]I want to start over.
[134:38.83]That wasn't a good run.
[134:49.59]What's the thing called when everybody breaks into like a dance like a what a flash dance or something flash mob?
[134:55.70]What is it called?
[134:56.16]Plan one of those.
[135:01.91]And it's just, holy shit, this is, and like, it's like right at the beginning when it's like, the doors are open, it's 10 a, well, it's like 2 p.m.
[135:09.60]I ain't fucking getting up to do this before then.
[135:13.28]I'm sorry, guys, no fuck, I, I don't, I don't care.
[135:16.12]I'm not getting up at like 7 a.m.
[135:17.68]to like be ready at 9 30 a.m.
[135:19.54]to do the flash mob.
[135:21.54]This is happening at 3.
[135:26.60]But everybody, the, the doors are open, it's time to come in at 2 p.m.
[135:31.93]And then there's like a... Ladies and gentlemen, there is an announcement to make over the PA system.
[135:36.02]Here we are.
[135:37.58]Everyone stops like, well, I wonder what the announcement is.
[135:39.36]And I kind of am in the middle.
[135:41.58]And then it's like the 20 to 30 paid dance actors that are with me break into a flash mob.
[135:46.63]And everyone's like, no way.
[135:48.05]And makes like a big circle and everything.
[136:08.93]No way!
[136:10.07]Oh my god.
[136:14.37]And I clearly, CLEARLY did not study the choreography very well.
[136:20.40]It's just... I... Maybe the night before I looked at the dance.
[136:36.41]And I'm just on a shitload of drugs.
[136:39.37]And everyone's like, oh man, I think so.
[136:41.05]What's wrong with him today?
[137:01.10]That's usual?
[137:01.90]No, it is not.
[137:02.64]It's so unusual that that's why I said it.
[137:27.17]Remember, this is the video.
[137:28.59]This is like the video version of this.
[137:39.07]We're making a fake video in our heads.
[137:40.70]You know how many times I've done this over the last 15 fucking years?
[137:45.32]I need keys.
[138:02.04]Give me that five of kind right there.
[138:15.39]No.
[138:15.91]Okay.
[138:24.16]Give me that sword.
[138:24.80]Shit.
[138:29.17]Alright, I got to make one of these happen.
[138:30.13]Kill a monster using only orbs.
[138:32.33]Single hits can be hard.
[138:34.67]Open a chest in a single move.
[138:35.93]I can do that too.
[138:36.65]Alright.
[138:37.59]Remind me.
[138:38.15]Orbs and open chest in single move.
[138:42.69]So I need four keys because that counts as two.
[138:55.57]I should also tell you the wood thing.
[138:57.43]I should turn that off.
[138:59.91]Where it's not giving me wood anymore.
[139:02.57]Alright, I need four keys.
[139:03.87]Can I get it?
[139:06.88]No, I cannot.
[139:07.94]I'm trying to set it up.
[139:24.58]Shit.
[139:29.99]Do I have four somewhere sitting around?
[139:32.91]Yep, right here.
[139:33.41]Okay.
[139:33.97]There we go.
[139:35.57]Single move.
[139:37.39]Does that count as a single move?
[139:38.39]Because it technically fell down.
[139:50.30]I hope that counts.
[140:00.45]Just use two.
[140:01.03]I gotta get something going here.
[140:12.29]I need orbs.
[140:26.13]You played Loop Hero?
[140:27.37]I played it very briefly.
[140:28.71]I got through the first boss, and I thought it was fun, but I put it down after that.
[140:50.51]Loop Hero is sick.
[140:55.73]Alright, how elaborate does Loop Hero get?
[141:08.29]Very and then I saw not very.
[141:09.73]OK.
[141:21.72]We're going to do just default.
[141:24.95]The score one might be fine to do.
[141:27.14]But no, we'll go in default.
[141:35.12]Alright, orbs and kill in one hit.
[141:57.91]100 million.
[142:06.83]Orb.
[142:18.24]Good.
[142:21.94]Good.
[142:29.59]That shield upgrade just saved everything.
[142:31.77]Fixed every problem I was having.
[142:47.10]Shit, uh... Um...
[143:04.83]Look at this shit.
[143:05.93]Let's go.
[143:08.76]This is how you get the big points.
[143:09.98]Bye, Vakhan, coming up.
[143:39.93]Nice, I got it.
[143:43.53]Keep rolling.
[144:00.77]Fuck.
[144:15.35]Another tree?
[144:16.11]Shit.
[144:21.99]Oh, come on.
[144:23.46]Nice.
[144:23.92]I got it again.
[144:32.83]Oh, shit.
[144:33.91]Come on.
[144:47.25]I didn't even use orbs.
[144:51.35]1.6 million?
[144:55.60]1.6 million.
[145:00.86]Nice.
[145:01.12]20% there.
[145:02.60]That was a big run.
[145:08.46]Look at all this experience I have.
[145:09.72]Holy shit.
[145:10.60]What do I even do with this?
[145:15.82]um open chest more time 10 chance for magic attacks to do special effect triple damage for crits um that's a that's the most expensive thing I have there but now now this is gonna be crazy that now should be way better
[145:48.21]There we go.
[145:50.31]Need more wood.
[145:57.99]700.
[145:58.03]Can I buy anything else?
[146:02.29]I don't think so.
[146:05.01]You've been sipping coffee?
[146:07.46]Yeah, not in the last 40 minutes or so, I'd say.
[146:11.12]I might go get a different drink or a snack or something.
[146:17.40]Alright.
[146:18.89]Five in a row match.
[146:19.85]That's not hard.
[146:21.57]I gotta clear these.
[146:25.73]Single hit and orbs.
[146:27.27]I could get the single hit now because of the crits.
[146:29.13]Let's see.
[146:34.95]Oh, I am filthy now.
[146:50.15]Still on this one guy.
[147:04.67]Oh shit.
[147:06.35]Oh God.
[147:06.79]I gotta get rid of some of this junk.
[147:48.94]Alright.
[147:49.82]Go over.
[147:50.20]Alright.
[148:02.63]Give me a ball.
[148:03.27]I need a ball.
[148:05.09]I haven't seen any balls.
[148:14.66]Oh, shit.
[148:21.50]No, I didn't want that.
[148:26.96]Ah, that was like a 10 chain happening.
[148:32.35]This one's... Alright, again, again, again.
[148:34.55]Go, go, go.
[148:44.62]Almost a 20% attack delay.
[148:50.26]Single hit, only orbs.
[149:11.19]Okay.
[149:11.43]31 shields.
[149:12.25]How much does one hit take, I wonder?
[149:21.68]Eating food is crazy.
[149:23.02]Did you see that?
[149:33.93]Shit.
[149:42.27]Chest.
[149:44.03]Dammit.
[150:15.05]Come on, I'm losing so much time I have no keys
[150:36.11]Where are the orbs?
[150:38.11]I've not seen a single one.
[150:39.18]Or did I just use it and not even realize I used it?
[150:43.98]Okay, that's an axe.
[150:46.15]That's not an orb.
[151:08.08]Oh, this is it here.
[151:08.86]I'm dead.
[151:13.97]Let's take it a few crazy crits.
[151:20.23]Stretch time.
[151:22.43]Trope.
[151:24.03]I'll get up.
[151:36.62]You're going to stream Elden Ring DLC?
[151:38.12]That's the plan.
[151:47.98]Stretching the bit for today.
[151:49.38]Ah, that's the permanent bit.
[151:50.72]You're going to do a new character?
[151:54.98]Okay, I don't know.
[151:58.35]So everything I've read about the DLC is like... It's going to be a different system to level up.
[152:08.50]It's not like, oh, you have to be level 100 and... You have to be level 90 to go in the DLC.
[152:12.65]It's going to just be a different system entirely.
[152:16.23]Kind of like Sekiro, yeah.
[152:19.45]So I don't think it matters what character it is.
[152:21.47]Because they're all going to get normalized when you go in the DLC.
[152:44.11]When is the mac and cheese stream?
[152:45.69]Me and my girlfriend are looking forward to it.
[152:48.71]Okay, listen.
[152:51.63]If you go, click on the videos tab on my Twitch page.
[153:00.22]Click on the last broadcast from yesterday.
[153:03.64]There is a special surprise for you.
[153:17.76]Okay, but when is it?
[153:19.87]It is yesterday at 1pm.
[153:24.31]For one day only.
[153:44.68]Oh, Jerma Watcher with a girlfriend?
[153:46.65]Doubt.
[153:47.63]Jerma Watcher is stupid.
[153:49.79]Oh, Jerma fans, right?
[153:51.41]Okay, one thing I do have to say.
[153:52.81]Aren't there a shitload of doctors and scientists in here?
[153:58.55]In the last year, did all the doctors leave the channel?
[154:01.95]We used to have a shitload of doctors.
[154:04.44]If there were doctors and scientists, did they all leave?
[154:17.66]Dude, that was one guy.
[154:19.16]I think I'm the most doctor-watched streamer.
[154:30.65]Or doctor-watching.
[154:32.49]Whatever that right term is.
[154:53.99]Wow, what an ego.
[154:56.54]I didn't say they were good doctors, I just said they were doctors.
[154:58.88]Yeah, I'm the most watched... Accidentally calling all the doctors that watch this channel stupid.
[155:17.79]Accidentally.
[155:30.34]Alright, the ideas are just kind of flowing right now.
[155:32.28]A stream showcasing a fake streaming service.
[155:38.26]That is like... It's like a doctored Twitch.
[155:42.71]Where instead, like, all of you in chat are doctors.
[155:48.25]And I'm standing there, like, showing a rash on my back.
[155:51.92]And you're all arguing in chat in what it is.
[156:02.01]Is that land or?
[156:27.97]Half the things that I come up with are things that I think are funny for 10 seconds that require like $100,000 to do.
[156:37.58]For 10 seconds.
[156:41.45]It's just... But it's worth it.
[156:45.67]What about that vampire routine?
[156:47.21]You don't have any idea how bad I want- how bad I feel about the vampire routine.
[156:56.30]That was going to be the last bit that I really did on the channel and I was like, yeah, what?
[157:00.50]And what not the last, you know, you know what I mean?
[157:02.14]Like in this period.
[157:07.62]You never know.
[157:08.36]It might just show up one day.
[157:10.81]Who cares?
[157:14.61]Who cares if it's Halloween or not?
[157:22.15]The last bit ever.
[157:55.42]I think I'm pretty close.
[157:58.20]One or two more really good runs and I might be really close to beating it.
[158:17.42]Staff.
[158:24.47]I can do this again.
[158:25.15]I don't even need it.
[158:27.03]44... Okay, I still need the orbs.
[158:49.09]That's a good start.
[158:51.07]Said that a bunch already.
[158:54.60]Keep it going.
[159:36.31]How do I have so much and nothing?
[159:45.39]Orb!
[160:15.42]Oh, not these guys.
[160:16.78]I think I'm dead right here.
[160:28.36]Hmm, maybe not.
[160:32.09]Ah.
[160:37.53]We're going to do withering... Yeah, withering rooms, yeah.
[160:40.83]I watched all the shit talking in Ster's chat and I want to see if you can back it up.
[160:46.53]Uh, yeah, I'll definitely show the game.
[160:52.70]It's the funniest gameplay of the year.
[161:07.75]Open.
[161:12.19]Open.
[161:14.78]Orb.
[161:16.66]Orb.
[161:18.56]Look.
[161:20.00]Are you looking?
[161:20.62]If you add a... onto anything, it automatically makes it interesting.
[161:30.05]It's an automatic interesting.
[161:50.14]I need another orb.
[161:50.94]I'm not confident I can kill in one hit.
[162:01.75]Not confident.
[162:02.75]I need another one.
[162:17.70]What is this bullshit?
[162:20.12]What is this bullshit?
[162:25.81]Okay, I still have an orb.
[162:30.81]Thoughts on pretzels?
[162:31.72]I think pretzels are the probably greatest snack item.
[162:48.09]Both soft and hard pretzels are S tier.
[162:51.65]Right next to each other for different reasons.
[162:55.73]A big soft pretzel is, I don't think anything on Earth is more enjoyable than that.
[163:01.47]I really don't think so.
[163:03.11]Especially a fresh, soft, but not doughy.
[163:08.12]There's a little bit of, you know, a little bit of crunch, a little bit like that, that crunchy edge.
[163:12.56]And soft and hot on the inside, oh my god.
[163:14.66]I don't think there's anything, nothing could make another human being happier, I don't think.
[163:21.14]And, you know, honestly, I'm not even a big fan of Auntie Anne's.
[163:26.35]I think it's good, but that's not the kind of pretzel I like.
[163:32.82]I like the... the... wait.
[163:36.20]Oh, fuck you.
[163:52.43]To me, Auntie Anne's is a little more...
[163:57.31]It's a little more bread than pretzel to me.
[164:01.37]It's missing that kind of, that darker kind of outer shell.
[164:15.76]I like my pretzels salty and crunchy and darker.
[164:21.42]Not necessarily buttery.
[164:23.92]Auntie, that's buttery.
[164:34.90]Sometimes you're in the mood for a buttery pretzel, but I just lost an orb because of this stupid fucking conversation.
[164:41.77]I'm leaving.
[164:42.43]No, I'm just kidding.
[164:54.22]I don't even like pretzels.
[164:56.58]I hate them.
[164:58.86]I've been pretending to like them.
[165:01.74]For content.
[165:04.08]What a stupid thing to do.
[165:17.65]Any new potions?
[165:23.23]No.
[165:23.49]1.6 million.
[165:38.22]Is there a lose condition?
[165:39.58]There is not.
[165:41.73]You just have to get 10 million points and you beat the game.
[166:03.30]Hmm, kind of a weird start.
[166:16.67]Give me another one so I can... Ah, damn it.
[166:20.25]Still gotta do it.
[166:21.03]Okay.
[166:44.49]Mm-hmm.
[166:45.55]Okay, get a ball.
[167:04.13]Two robots in a row, whatever these are.
[167:44.30]This wouldn't happen if I had another orb.
[167:51.53]Good.
[167:51.93]Okay.
[167:59.77]Here we go.
[168:00.25]I can't kill this with two orbs.
[168:03.62]I need to...
[168:19.45]Shit!
[168:27.26]I didn't get anything?
[168:28.10]Maybe I should have saved for this one.
[168:38.12]Eh, no, it's worth it.
[168:46.03]Should have saved the orbs for the next run.
[168:47.93]Yeah, I got greedy because I was seeing the big tree.
[168:51.57]I was like, wait, if I use these orbs, I could get through the tree and maybe keep going.
[168:57.25]And get more.
[168:58.25]I'd get like three million.
[168:59.31]Okay, good.
[169:34.35]I'm addicted.
[169:36.53]Good.
[169:36.91]Look at this.
[169:37.55]Here we go.
[169:37.95]I hate when you get frozen and you can't see anything.
[169:56.60]Ah, it's right here.
[169:57.24]Fuck.
[170:19.20]Come on, quick.
[170:26.31]Uh, fuck.
[170:30.43]Fuck, there's no keys!
[170:45.24]Crap.
[170:57.43]You guys throwing shit?
[171:03.72]I did something right now.
[171:06.44]I can't see it.
[171:08.96]I got that.
[171:20.58]You're torturing us by gulping.
[171:25.41]I am the gulp.
[171:27.97]I do the gulps, don't I?
[171:29.07]Isn't that what I'm known for?
[171:30.13]What do you think I'm most known for?
[171:32.09]Do you think it's like... It's probably up there.
[171:48.44]The sus guy.
[171:52.78]What a world!
[171:53.90]What a world!
[172:18.12]Two chests in a row?

[174:54.47]What is this?
[174:56.51]Jerma eats pretzels and enjoys them thoroughly.
[174:58.75]Jerma eats pretzels and enjoys them thoroughly.
[175:03.83]Jerma eats pretzels and then farts them back out.
[175:12.07]Oh, dear.
[175:18.56]I raised you better than this.
[175:22.31]I raised you better than this.
[175:23.19]Alright, this is pretty good.
[175:43.98]No, it wasn't us.
[175:48.26]It wasn't me.
[175:52.04]I wasn't the one saying that.
[176:00.90]Okay.
[176:03.00]I got almost a two million one time.
[176:04.68]Use two axes.
[176:07.50]You gotta get a run.
[176:08.84]You know the one.
[176:09.58]When it happens, it just happens.
[176:11.05]You know it.
[176:12.65]It's the run.
[176:17.35]Like this one.
[176:25.56]Where it's just a constant flow.
[176:55.78]Nice.
[176:56.02]Okay.
[177:01.12]Keys for this one.
[177:19.57]I'm going for points.
[177:20.47]I don't care about the quest right now.
[177:37.20]Fuck.
[177:39.50]I can't see anything.
[177:41.57]There we go.
[177:41.85]I got too many backpacks, that's why.
[178:11.61]shit don't give me keys annoying alright I think we just got more multiplier alright I think I'm gonna do armor
[178:43.77]Yeah, let's do all the armor upgrades and then I'm gonna do tier 2.
[179:00.85]27?
[179:01.07]Nah.
[179:07.29]Yeah, so 88 times multiplier now.
[179:10.34]And 4 times collection.
[179:14.23]very cool we need to ban somebody?
[179:27.59]is somebody being annoying?
[179:39.76]somebody needs to get timed out
[179:50.65]Can we be honest?
[179:52.31]What are you doing?
[179:54.09]What are you doing?
[179:55.03]Good start.
[180:32.99]Yeah, some of you guys need to fucking relax.
[181:17.94]Don't use the ball.
[181:18.86]Save all balls permanently until I have three.
[181:28.52]It's only ball collection run.
[181:30.12]This guy's hurt.
[181:53.14]Ball Fondler?
[181:54.22]No, there can never be another Ball Fondler.
[181:56.00]Don't you understand?
[181:59.12]Because every new person that wants to be Ball Fondler is going to make the Ball Fondler routine that much less interesting.
[182:08.19]There can only be one Ball Fondler.
[182:19.39]Some of you really want to be the next Ball Fondler, but that's not how it works.
[182:25.25]That's not how it works.
[182:38.50]Two balls, good.
[182:53.52]OK, here it comes.
[182:54.74]Finally can clear this quest.
[182:59.10]Three.
[183:03.67]I just screwed up everything.
[183:04.57]Oh, I hate when this happens when everything just blends together.
[183:35.70]Nothing matches in my brain.
[183:36.92]Okay.
[183:53.16]I'm in trouble now.
[183:59.98]Damn.
[184:00.62]Eight chain.
[184:01.10]I can keep going.
[184:02.34]We're good.
[184:08.94]Oh shit, kind of on a roll.
[184:10.50]Alright, just focus.
[184:51.87]Yeah, get the fuck out of here.
[185:17.09]That's alright, I'll take I'll take 2 million.
[185:29.41]Alright.
[185:31.51]It's time for a ban.
[185:32.63]Time for a ban.
[185:34.93]Gotta go for it.
[185:37.01]Anybody here?
[185:37.89]Gotta go for a ban.
[185:41.04]It's ban time.
[185:50.78]You're gonna get at least an hour to think about what you've done.
[185:59.68]Okay.
[186:05.48]Yes, we like pretzels.
[186:12.04]Oh, God.
[186:25.08]You banned the wrong person?
[186:26.26]I didn't ban anybody yet.
[186:33.50]Hey, that's kind of suspect.
[186:35.92]Hey, dude, you banned the wrong person.
[186:37.30]You banned me.
[186:38.64]No, I didn't.
[186:39.00]What are you talking about?
[186:39.74]Why are you saying that?
[186:58.29]Alright.
[187:01.18]How do you ban somebody?
[187:03.48]I don't even know how to do it.
[187:12.45]Okay, here we go.
[187:13.27]I think I know how.
[187:21.61]Okay.
[187:26.14]I think I did it.
[187:27.56]I think I did it!
[187:34.36]Dude, what the fuck are you doing?
[187:38.90]I think I pressed the button.
[187:49.54]That was the wrong guy.
[187:50.90]Oh, well.
[187:58.56]Alright.
[188:00.20]88 times.
[188:01.51]Kill a boss.
[188:24.03]Stretch time.
[188:31.61]Stretch time.
[188:43.30]Stretch every 15.
[188:43.82]I think we're doing every 30.
[188:45.50]30 to 40.
[189:02.44]You can go to the bathroom now if you need to go.
[189:03.76]You can go to the bathroom whenever you feel like.
[189:29.67]How do you deal with a t-shirt with a neck that's too tight?
[189:33.19]Oh, I know what you, I know what you mean.
[189:34.65]It sucks.
[189:36.69]You love the shirt.
[189:37.43]It fits you perfectly, except it kind of chokes you.
[189:58.94]You know, maybe I should go pee too.
[190:00.02]Yeah, I'll be right back.
[190:02.13]I've been going for about three hours.
[190:07.03]I'll go for a little bit longer.
[190:08.52]I still want to show Wuthering Rooms too, so... I'll be right back.
[193:54.07]I'm back.
[194:05.35]Alright.
[194:06.27]Time to steamroll is coming.
[194:07.87]I need more wood.
[194:16.60]I need more wood and I need more money.
[194:25.82]Oh, more potions.
[194:28.46]Ranged attacks do zero damage, but other attacks do plus 30.
[194:35.61]So that... Balls?
[194:38.29]Uh... Axes?
[194:40.01]That sounds pretty good.
[194:40.93]Okay, the enemy is harder.
[194:46.52]15%.
[194:47.66]15% and there's more locks.
[194:49.78]I feel like I want to activate both these eventually.
[194:54.88]I'll do this one too.
[194:57.56]See how that works.
[195:12.71]I actually got an Olipop.
[195:15.65]I got Cherry Olipop.
[195:18.85]Pretty good.
[195:29.45]those any good I okay here's the thing about olipop you have to be ready for it you have to be ready for what you're getting into it's not a Dr. pepper or oh my god it's so it's like a sprite it has a different kind of flavor but after a little while you're like I actually kind of like this the way that this tastes
[195:54.03]They have a cola.
[195:54.69]They have like a vintage cola flavor.
[195:57.89]And when I first took a sip out of it, I was like, I hate this.
[196:00.23]This is fucking dog shit.
[196:03.48]But after another few sips, I was like, wait a minute.
[196:06.84]It's kind of good.
[196:08.10]I kind of actually enjoy this.
[196:20.04]It has that, it tastes like, um, the way that it reminds me, it reminds me of almost like a burnt sugar flavor.
[196:26.48]At least the cola one.
[196:29.40]And then you look at the side and you go, wait a minute, this has four or five grams of sugar in it.
[196:35.99]I've been trying to reduce some of the kind of intake of some of that stuff.
[196:43.65]As I start to get a little older.
[196:44.65]Trying to drop the sugar intake.
[196:48.21]Drop the saturated fat.
[196:49.45]The cholesterol.
[196:50.41]It's not good for me.
[196:53.12]Hold on.
[197:13.43]Come on.
[197:13.87]Oh, why can't I do it?
[197:18.65]Why can't I do it?
[197:21.87]I did it.
[197:22.15]Let's open it.
[197:35.95]Fuck, I didn't think I was going to kill him with one hit.
[197:46.34]Oh, that's right.
[197:46.84]I do have 30% more damage.
[197:48.14]I forgot I did that.
[197:50.16]That is a thing.
[197:51.04]This is the end of this one.
[198:09.13]Maybe not.
[198:11.63]Get lucky.
[198:27.28]I can't believe I was 27.
[198:32.29]I was 27 more than 10 years ago.
[198:33.87]I know, I'm not even at 10 million yet.
[198:41.96]I could do way better than this.
[198:43.36]I still need more wood.
[198:50.90]But... Let's take some more damage.
[199:01.08]Wait, I need a wood and stone run.
[199:02.50]50% more stone and wood.
[199:06.02]Okay, so I just want a ton of stone and wood.
[199:11.59]I don't care about winning.
[199:12.39]I just care about making this go high.
[199:15.87]How do you like sliced apples?
[199:16.99]They're good.
[199:31.78]That was a good chain.
[199:32.58]Alright, stone and wood.
[199:34.80]Don't care about anything else.
[199:35.82]I have to kill things.
[199:57.34]I can't just not do that.
[200:11.05]Stop dying!
[200:53.44]Damn, those guys are tough.
[200:54.56]Holy shit.
[200:56.20]Barely even hurt him.
[201:18.42]More stone.
[201:30.69]Alright, I'm kind of on a roll.
[201:34.28]I'm going to get some more multiplier here.
[201:49.53]Oh.
[201:58.81]How much money do I have?
[202:08.74]I need a thousand more wood.
[202:10.74]How am I gonna get a thousand wood?
[202:30.54]What's your voice care routine?
[202:32.16]I'm surprised you don't sound decrepit.
[202:41.10]I think you know when you talk a little too much and you go, alright, I need to stop talking for a little while.
[202:48.91]I try never to cross that threshold of it's been way too much and now you're going to hurt your voice.
[202:58.75]I usually, nine out of ten times, I'm just sipping on something.
[203:03.07]Whether it's like water or tea or...
[203:08.34]the the need of lubrication and I mean it's important well you'll turn to dust
[203:41.87]Alright, I need 2700 wood.
[204:04.72]Was it half a million?
[204:05.68]Oh, I am a half a million.
[204:06.86]Okay.
[204:10.20]Well, the game's not called Half a Million.
[204:11.93]It's called Ten Million.
[204:14.71]So, come on, man.
[204:22.51]Just open it.
[204:30.60]Oops.
[204:38.66]Alright, I'm going to give this like another 20 minutes.
[204:41.60]And then if I can't get to the end of 10 million, then I still do want to show some Withering Rooms because I think the game's awesome.
[204:49.28]I've beaten Withering Rooms.
[204:53.12]I loved it.
[205:04.63]I'm confident that I could get this thing another 20, 30 minutes.
[205:08.70]I need one monster run and I'm good.
[205:12.10]Oh shit, I thought I was gonna be the door.
[205:13.28]I didn't even see this guy.
[205:18.98]Oh god.
[205:23.87]Ranking up again.
[205:24.53]Fuck!
[205:35.67]I need more armor.
[205:46.53]almost there come on 2700 right okay okay 16. I think one more run with the extra um the extra wooden stuff would be good and I can upgrade
[206:10.58]Didn't mean to do that, but I did.
[206:18.82]Good.
[206:19.57]Go.
[206:26.59]Good.
[206:26.89]Keep it rolling.
[206:32.73]Good.
[206:34.93]Excellent.
[206:38.77]uh I don't even know what's over here let's open it another one shit enemy
[207:15.65]I'm so far in front of the screen, I can't even tell where I am.
[207:21.63]Good, give me that extra stuff.
[207:24.11]Come on.
[207:25.61]Max it out.
[207:26.74]840.
[207:29.02]Max it out!
[207:31.38]Yes!
[207:31.88]I got it.
[207:41.17]Got cheese lined up too.
[207:42.35]Perfect.
[207:42.75]Perfect.
[208:00.96]Keep going, come on.
[208:02.52]Good.
[208:05.08]Good.
[208:13.46]Shit.
[208:29.66]Kill the dinosaur!
[208:41.84]That was a fucking good one.
[208:53.55]Do you like sparkling ices?
[208:55.00]You mean like a soda?
[209:05.52]Or just like a... What do you mean?
[209:15.33]The brand.
[209:15.99]Oh, the sparkling ice, the brand.
[209:20.41]I feel like I've had it before.
[209:21.81]Is it kind of like the long plastic bottles?
[209:32.88]I feel like I've had it before.
[209:33.72]I remember it was good.
[209:38.03]I didn't dislike it or anything from what I remember.
[209:44.77]Okay, what is important here?
[209:52.59]Should I just save up and get the huge one?
[209:57.61]I think I'm going to save up and get one of these big ones.
[209:59.41]Because another one lock less on chests.
[210:04.61]That shaves the run in half.
[210:09.10]I'm saving up for that one.
[210:17.99]Scratch time.
[210:18.59]I'll get up in a minute.
[210:20.69]After this one.
[210:21.21]Kill an armored monster within five seconds.
[210:23.02]Kill a boss.
[210:26.10]Open a chest or door by using a scroll.
[210:27.90]Okay.
[210:49.46]I still have the wood thing on, don't I?
[211:16.77]Good.
[211:34.76]That's all I got from a sword scroll was one's... What?
[211:38.58]That can't be right.
[211:39.34]There's got to be a bug.
[211:41.82]Game's bugged.
[211:43.28]It bugged out.
[211:43.78]Very good.
[212:14.43]I need more of these, yeah.
[212:18.55]Am I not getting experience like the pink one?
[212:22.65]Did I turn it off or something?
[212:23.65]I forget.
[212:23.97]With one of the potions.
[212:41.16]I'm ranking up again.
[212:43.51]I need to kill the shit in here.
[212:59.18]I get stuck at the same point every time here.
[213:03.58]I need more damage.
[213:18.63]I killed a boss?
[213:20.87]What was the boss I killed?
[213:31.00]Oh, the tree is a boss, technically.
[213:32.44]That's right.
[213:32.78]Alright, I want more shields.
[213:47.15]17 per match.
[213:47.95]Good.
[213:50.91]Potion time.
[213:58.57]Okay, yeah.
[213:59.03]Turn that off now.
[214:01.71]Keep these on.
[214:05.17]So these are kind of, what, negating each other?
[214:08.30]Because this is 30% more damage.
[214:11.96]I'm getting 5% more damage.
[214:17.84]Except for the ranged attacks.
[214:20.77]Oh, stretch.
[214:21.39]I'm getting up.
[214:36.12]Have you played New Vegas before?
[214:38.82]It's funny you say that.
[214:39.99]New Vegas, I believe, was the first thing I ever streamed on Twitch.
[214:47.83]That may have been one of the first times I streamed on Twitch.
[214:57.15]At least the first, like, two weeks.
[215:03.91]Undertale was pretty early as well, yeah.
[215:09.04]Sorcery, Undertale, Fallout New Vegas, and honestly, Overwatch were in the pool of games I streamed on Twitch, like, ten years ago.
[215:30.18]Salt and Sanctuary, yeah.
[215:31.42]That's just how I talk, man.
[215:38.41]I don't know.
[216:02.04]Pretend you've never streamed before and do it all over again.
[216:21.98]Why do you sound so sad?
[216:23.04]Christopher Walken is great.
[216:26.73]Christopher Walken is amazing, but... I don't know, I just talk the way that I talk.
[216:33.11]Sometimes I go like this.
[216:35.89]Sometimes I go like this.
[216:38.67]Sometimes I go like this.
[216:39.97]I don't know.
[216:50.00]I got five more reps to do.
[216:52.84]Don't rush me.
[216:55.26]Or I'll fucking ban ya.
[217:35.89]Let's go.
[217:36.19]Let's do it again.
[217:45.93]I need to see that 10 million one.
[217:48.82]I don't need to see it.
[217:49.80]I don't care.
[217:51.70]I would like to see it.
[217:56.94]We don't demand things anymore.
[217:58.04]We just simply ask for them.
[218:03.39]Maybe you should take a page out of that book, chat.
[218:26.15]I need 16,000.
[218:42.89]When you need a key, they just don't exist.
[218:50.64]A lot of monsters in a row.
[218:52.52]Oh, I wanted to go to the other side.
[219:10.37]Shit.
[219:11.63]Alright, I'll still get it.
[219:17.47]Fuck you!
[219:17.99]What is with that little... There's only one.
[219:19.99]Uh, open a door with a scroll is one of them, right?
[219:28.04]So... That didn't work!
[219:46.27]Ah, I still got it.
[219:46.83]I still got the kill.
[219:54.07]Not this tree fucker again.
[220:03.72]Drew Crew?
[220:04.24]I actually... I want to play Drew Crew.
[220:06.06]Okay.
[220:11.36]This, I think, is a very good thing to have.
[220:17.11]That is a full less amount of... I just need way less keys.
[220:21.65]So, let's do it.
[220:24.14]It's a lot, but it's worth it.
[220:32.34]27.
[220:32.38]I need more wood.
[220:36.73]Bad.
[220:41.23]Two five in a row.
[220:42.93]Open a chest or... Okay, I can open a chest with the scroll.
[220:47.78]Armored monster within five seconds constitutes an armored enemy.
[220:59.69]I don't want the keys in the inventory.
[221:24.60]Nice, OK.
[221:50.43]Come on.
[221:58.86]I love this game.
[222:06.53]Two axes.
[222:07.09]Those are big.
[222:07.59]I wish this was a head of sword in here.
[222:50.08]Okay.
[222:50.24]Come on, come on, come on.
[222:51.40]More.
[222:59.36]Still not open?
[223:04.62]Die!
[223:14.07]Got it.
[223:22.50]Fucking do something!
[223:23.24]What am I doing?
[223:51.00]Come on, kill!
[223:54.34]Yes!
[223:54.74]Kill him!
[223:55.41]Okay, good, good, good, good, good.
[223:56.29]I'm getting a lot of points.
[224:26.01]Give me somebody else.
[224:27.13]I got a five of a kind right here.
[224:40.94]Oh, I got no time for this shit.
[224:42.06]Come on.
[224:45.12]That was a good one. 2.5.
[224:55.61]2.5 million.
[224:56.35]Okay, it's time to... Hmm.
[225:09.52]Is it damage?
[225:11.62]Damage, or is it reduction?
[225:14.07]I don't know.
[225:20.67]Stretch overdue?
[225:21.45]I did one 10-20 minutes ago.
[225:25.08]Just do damage always.
[225:25.98]I'll do some gold runs then.
[225:34.52]Some more stone and wood.
[225:52.81]And then 20% of wood and stone counts as gold.
[225:58.19]I could turn these on too, but... Eh.
[226:00.63]Not now.
[226:11.02]You have a potion that makes you take more damage?
[226:15.10]Uh... Am I taking more damage or is that... Hold on.
[226:28.32]Oh, wait, this is bad.
[226:30.96]Ranged attacks.
[226:32.50]Okay.
[226:33.48]Yeah, let me turn that off.
[226:34.18]It's true.
[226:37.80]Okay, I need 1.4 million to get the next rank, which will turn this into probably times 100.
[226:50.77]This is a money run.
[227:22.75]Didn't want to use that, but I kind of had to.
[227:24.37]Stone, please.
[227:58.26]I was cooking with that one.
[228:29.56]Tree.
[228:31.16]Come on, get through the tree.
[228:32.00]There we go.
[228:51.00]Keys.
[228:52.86]Uh, whatever.
[229:10.83]that's happened like three times now alright I gotta kill this thing right now
[229:40.70]Damn it.
[229:44.02]I got to 1.4 at least.
[229:46.22]Yeah, I got 1.4.
[229:51.36]That'll make the multiplier go crazy.
[229:56.88]What is that?
[229:57.18]Let's see.
[230:02.00]Played Balatro?
[230:02.77]I have played Balatro.
[230:06.51]It is one of the most addictive.
[230:07.55]That also could be game of the year.
[230:09.75]Right now, Balatro and Withering Rooms are the two game of the year contenders for me right now so far.
[230:24.14]Eat three food items.
[230:25.28]Easy.
[230:25.86]Alright.
[230:27.43]But more damage.
[230:38.70]I need 4,300.
[230:46.64]I can't go higher than this, so this is it.
[230:49.59]This is for all the big ones.
[230:59.21]RRPG?
[231:00.31]Yeah, I will show it before I stop.
[231:04.23]Yeah, Withering Rooms is a side-scrolling 3D clock tower slash Silent Hill slash Dark Souls slash Resident Evil game.
[231:18.60]That's the best way to actually to describe it, for real.
[231:28.36]It's a granny-like?
[231:30.10]No, not quite a granny-like.
[231:32.74]Not quite.
[231:47.90]I told Ster about it.
[231:49.22]I was like, oh my God, you gotta play this game with Ring Rooms.
[231:51.50]It's so good.
[231:53.16]He streamed it yesterday.
[231:53.92]I was in his chat complaining.
[232:09.76]But there's a reason why I like it a lot.
[232:13.09]It kind of has that same vibe.
[232:14.43]You know when a video game just kind of comes out and the game doesn't really tell you very much.
[232:20.12]It's just like, oh, hey, this is kind of what you're doing.
[232:22.54]And who knows what the fuck that item does.
[232:26.92]It has that going for it.
[232:33.65]Kind of reminds me of like the early Dark Souls days where it's just like, I don't know what the fuck that is, but I guess it's cool.
[232:40.30]What is that?
[232:42.30]Who's that character?
[232:43.64]I think it's a solo dev too.
[232:49.90]I wasn't paying attention at all.
[232:59.64]Yeah, you hijacked Holly's Twitch account to complain.
[233:04.32]We were watching it at the same time.
[233:05.78]It was easier just to lean over to Holly's computer and just be like, what the fuck are you doing, man?
[233:28.37]I can feel the 10 million and sense it.
[233:33.16]I'll be like two or three more upgrades and I think I'll be able to do it.
[233:35.86]Alright, I'm going to focus.
[233:51.53]Focus up.
[234:10.08]I got nothing!
[234:12.52]I got nothing.
[234:14.02]Oh, that was frustrating.
[234:33.30]Got nothing.
[234:35.24]I got nothing.
[234:36.68]I got nothing.
[234:38.58]I got nothing.
[234:50.46]Oh, I fucking used the ball.
[234:51.82]Again, do it again, do it again, do it again.
[234:56.21]It should be instant kill.
[235:03.90]Good, okay.
[235:24.09]Get right up in the front.
[235:35.22]That's a five of kind right there!
[235:53.72]shit come on do something anything oh I had to do it I said I gotta refresh the brain there we go oh shit that was eight
[236:44.21]You piece of shit!
[236:45.15]I'm right there!
[236:47.29]Ugh!
[236:47.43]4,000.
[236:55.24]Alright, I think I have enough to do this.
[236:56.68]55 to 68?
[237:03.41]Or 70?
[237:03.53]Oh yeah.
[237:14.54]Celtics are getting sweeped by the Mavs.
[237:17.06]Don't, don't remind me.
[237:20.03]Really?
[237:20.35]You're gonna, really?
[237:23.35]Don't bring that shit up here.
[237:25.33]You're gonna remind me of that right now?
[237:28.69]I've been seething all week over that.
[237:31.86]And I just barely started to kind of forget about it until you just brought it up.
[237:40.22]Celtics are going to make some fucking trades in the offseason here, and you'll see.
[237:43.64]They're going to get a lot better.
[237:44.90]Yeah, enjoy your playoff run.
[237:51.61]Yeah, what, one year maybe you'll get there?
[237:53.97]I have no idea.
[237:57.68]I don't even know the record of either one of those teams.
[238:09.62]I just got shit on.
[238:10.64]Alright, focus time.
[238:17.46]I need more damage.
[239:09.34]Gotta keep the shields up always.
[239:10.62]Good.
[239:30.07]Good.
[239:39.17]The fucking lizard.
[239:40.61]Come on.
[239:58.78]Yes!
[240:11.68]Do it.
[240:27.58]Yes, next rank.
[240:29.93]Kill.
[240:39.79]Fuck.
[240:51.62]Alright, that was a good run.
[240:56.04]I didn't eat three food items?
[240:57.22]How?
[241:02.26]Stretch time?
[241:03.14]Yeah, it is.
[241:12.72]I need more money.
[241:13.40]Can I do- I need more potions.
[241:15.42]I'll get up and stretch you up.
[241:18.31]Ah, okay.
[241:20.67]Receive 20% of wood and stone as experience.
[241:26.18]You know what?
[241:26.54]Here's what we're going to do.
[241:38.70]I'm curious what I can do with this.
[241:42.01]Just try to get fewer luck.
[241:45.03]Alright, last one and I'll stretch.
[242:11.01]Hmm.
[242:20.13]Could have got five of kind there.
[242:35.85]Stretch now.
[242:38.23]I will.
[242:38.55]A five of kind staff didn't kill you?
[243:13.17]Everything's so spread out.
[243:16.03]Ah!
[243:19.07]Oh, that one sucked.
[243:24.01]Again.

[244:01.00]I am... labergasted.
[244:14.79]Key.
[244:17.16]I thought... I thought... What happened to my key unlock thing that I got?
[244:31.85]Shit, there was a door, not an enemy.
[244:57.42]Everything's so spread out.
[244:59.08]Fuck.

[251:49.34]Okay, good.
[252:12.86]That'll open it, right?
[252:13.86]Yes!
[252:22.25]Another dinosaur right after this?
[252:25.17]Are you kidding me?
[252:27.91]That's two dinos in a row.
[252:31.89]How is anyone supposed to handle two dinos?
[252:52.13]Welcome Raiders?
[252:53.03]There was a Raid?
[252:55.49]Who Raided?
[253:06.27]Oh, nice.
[253:06.57]I got that.
[253:15.25]For one... People are still saying one day only.
[253:17.83]That was four hours ago.
[253:25.39]Where have I been?
[253:28.27]Anywhere and wherever.
[253:29.71]Wherever, everywhere, and anywhere.
[253:34.25]Wherever.
[253:34.57]Okay.
[253:50.16]More... More armor, too, I think.
[253:54.15]Yeah.
[253:54.27]Yeah.
[254:00.71]Okay, I need to upgrade to this shit.
[254:04.17]Alright, more money.
[254:07.03]Perform 12 double matches.
[254:08.79]Okay, I gotta eat three food items.
[254:11.71]Kill an armored monster.
[254:13.07]Who counts as an armored monster?
[254:14.77]That was food right there too.
[254:26.99]Shit.
[254:37.01]Ball.
[254:49.44]Chest?
[254:49.82]Nope.
[254:54.14]Fuck, that was a five of a kind right there, I think.
[255:00.50]One food item.
[255:23.60]Chest!
[255:40.48]Duh!
[255:44.45]shit hurry up in a row alright
[256:26.39]How did you not die from that?
[256:28.35]I thought I was gambling.
[256:38.96]This does look like it could be gambling.
[256:40.97]I will give that to you.
[256:55.41]We need staff all the way, too.
[256:56.86]Can I do anything else here?
[257:18.83]Might as well.
[257:20.87]Okay, hold on.
[257:24.26]I'm gonna save up for these two.
[257:25.84]Especially this one, the 10% score is a big deal.
[257:32.75]800 stone and 800 wood.
[257:37.33]You got it.
[257:40.68]Actually, it's not even counting as that though, right?
[257:55.41]Still counting his money.
[257:56.27]Hmm...
[258:22.24]As long as I stay up at the front, I don't care.
[258:24.02]As long as I'm right like a foot and a half behind it, that's fine for me.
[258:33.69]Sweet.
[258:36.39]Should have saved it, but whatever.
[258:37.47]I'd rather stay up here.
[258:39.55]Give me a chest.
[258:39.99]Yep.
[258:40.99]Give me a chest.
[259:02.28]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[259:08.10]Oh!
[259:10.22]Oh!
[259:22.91]Door.
[259:26.43]Not a door.
[259:36.78]That was a whole lot of nothing for that.
[259:38.46]Fanfare.
[259:41.40]Did I lose?
[259:41.98]Alright, I gotta go turn this off.
[260:06.70]You missed a five of a kind?
[260:14.07]My boyfriend and I celebrated our seven year anniversary watching the mac and cheese stream.
[260:19.73]What a way to celebrate it.
[260:20.73]Did you have mac and cheese?
[260:30.72]I hope you had a mac and cheese themed birthday cake.
[260:34.78]That's not what you just told me you did.
[260:40.24]Ow.
[260:43.89]Seven years.
[260:47.91]It wasn't a birthday.
[260:50.25]Okay.
[260:50.99]It wasn't a birthday.
[260:51.79]A seven year together cake made out of mac and cheese.
[261:06.49]Alright, I need more of this and I need more of that.
[261:12.01]I want experience.
[261:15.12]So plus 50% stone and well, that's not going to be zero.
[261:18.00]OK, I think I'm good with that.
[261:27.93]I can deal with an extra lock on chest, I think.
[261:37.26]Worth more points.
[261:38.34]Who cares?
[261:54.88]It's not that big of a deal.
[261:57.00]Feels like it could be, but it's not.
[262:00.68]I say that now.
[262:01.40]Hold on.
[262:24.16]I'm at kind of this wall between 3 and 4 million.
[262:26.36]I need way more of that to happen.
[262:42.21]Ugh, stop freezing!
[263:02.14]Come on.
[263:08.05]Chest.
[263:08.37]Yep.
[263:22.05]Queue it up.
[263:24.76]Two monsters back to back and one's a dinosaur.
[263:26.90]This really is a wall right now.
[263:52.69]Come on, please.
[264:00.63]No food either.
[264:03.07]Ah, shit.
[264:03.71]Alright.
[264:10.53]One more run and I should be good.
[264:20.97]There's one food item.
[264:39.95]Okay.
[264:42.50]It's a key.
[264:42.96]I'm just doing it.
[264:51.26]Good.
[265:03.69]Did you hear Otto sneeze?
[265:13.75]He just went... That's two food items.
[265:39.20]This is a better run.
[265:42.46]Keys...
[265:45.93]I'm going to have to throw this at somebody.
[265:47.39]Good.
[265:58.30]Good.
[266:00.50]Okay.
[266:01.99]Eat.
[266:09.17]I need one more coffee or whatever that is.
[266:18.64]Oh, shit.
[266:19.14]Come on.
[266:19.68]I need a key.
[266:20.84]Come on.
[266:21.40]There's got to be a combination I can do right here, right?
[266:27.47]Okay, good.
[266:29.15]Good.
[266:38.87]Fuck.
[266:46.34]Ah!
[266:52.37]When it matters, I just can't make anything.
[266:54.09]Fuck.
[266:57.45]I didn't even get free food.
[266:58.59]I had two, two, two, two.
[267:04.10]I couldn't make anything.
[267:18.90]I think you just gotta keep going.
[267:20.02]You just gotta keep making shit.
[267:21.32]Don't wait for anything.
[267:24.34]You just gotta make, make, make, make, make.
[267:26.02]Don't even, just don't even stop.
[267:27.20]Just make, even if it's keys, who cares?
[267:28.40]Make everything.
[267:29.44]Make everything. ...
[268:01.57]Fuck, this is bad.
[268:20.90]Okay, gotta do it.
[268:22.39]Just give me some more options.
[268:28.85]So many keys now!
[268:51.29]Yes!
[269:00.53]Uh-oh.
[269:03.77]Oh, okay.
[269:21.63]die okay good key key key key I need keys oh that's it oh my goodness I can't lose to a key door really I got a lot of points to spend though how much what do I need
[269:50.08]Alright, I'm going to be almost at fully maxed out weapons very soon here.
[269:53.82]Okay.
[270:08.29]What do I want, 32,000?
[270:10.93]He's addicted.
[270:14.83]Okay, 32,000 gives me permanent 10%.
[270:17.35]Or 16 gives me an extra item slot, which is a big deal.
[270:23.33]Once I get past this wall of like four, I should be fine.
[270:27.35]I'm just kind of... I don't have to beat it right now.
[270:31.55]I just felt like playing it.
[271:03.09]You've gotta beat it.
[271:05.49]I mean, if you come into this, you kinda have to.
[271:07.61]You gotta try, right?
[271:14.10]It's fun to do the match three.
[271:16.60]I like match three games like this when they don't cost any money.
[271:21.04]Like this is just, oh yeah, this is great.
[271:22.94]I don't have to spend, there's no money involved.
[271:24.67]I just have to buy it and then just do this.
[271:29.37]That was a crazy change.
[271:50.21]Good.
[271:53.51]Crit somebody.
[271:59.90]I thought I just did that to a chest for a second.
[272:01.38]I was supposed to be really mad at myself.
[272:05.28]Okay, be careful because there's a lot of these and I don't want to spend it all.
[272:08.27]Look at how many... Look at how much good shit there is!
[272:10.03]Ugh.
[272:30.25]Fuck it, let's go.
[272:37.50]There's a big five of a kind right there.
[273:18.98]444 MILLION!
[273:48.10]4.5 million, let's see it.
[273:55.86]5 million, come on!
[273:58.51]I need this!
[274:16.45]5.8 million, come on!
[274:33.03]6.5 million, come on!
[274:36.93]Alright, that was a good run though.
[274:40.75]Still didn't get any of those.
[274:52.02]What do I got for potions right now?
[275:01.06]Alright.
[275:01.64]So what is six point something?
[275:05.26]That'd be six.
[275:09.03]I wonder if I have both these on.
[275:11.41]I mean, I had this one on and I did pretty good.
[275:19.73]I'm going to keep this on.
[275:21.83]We'll just do it again.
[275:26.22]You might have to go back down a rank.
[275:28.86]Oh.
[275:31.30]To do this other challenge.
[275:35.70]Kill an armored monster with an... Which one of these is an armor?
[275:38.69]They both... They kind of just have... Pants on.
[275:40.91]Pants.
[275:41.35]Pants.
[275:41.59]Is it the treant?
[275:45.59]Stretch break right after this.
[275:46.49]I'll do it.
[275:51.81]Maybe the ninja.
[275:55.42]I think I could do it if I had enough tools to attack with.
[276:01.09]Let's try it again.
[276:24.04]Just gotta go super aggressive in the beginning.
[276:34.85]Mm-mm.
[276:36.93]We're good.
[276:49.60]Come on.
[276:50.56]Do something.
[276:56.17]He's still alive?
[276:56.89]What the fuck?
[277:18.07]Open it!
[277:31.74]Alright, I just made up a lot of time.
[277:32.78]They're good.
[277:47.80]Die!
[278:05.01]I didn't even hurt him.
[278:06.29]That was a four of a kind didn't hurt.
[278:07.60]What is that bullshit?
[278:16.67]Oh no, I'm going against dinosaur right now.
[278:49.80]I was just cracked out for a second there.
[278:51.36]Ugh.
[278:51.46]Alright, 32,000.
[279:03.02]Is it 10% score or 20% damage versus dragons?
[279:04.02]I would say 10%.
[279:24.17]Can save up for the dragon one too.
[279:38.38]How am I doing on this?
[279:40.42]Why not?
[279:40.86]Alright, I'll get up.
[279:48.21]Stretch time.
[279:57.20]I'm gonna go get another drink too.
[279:59.25]So if you guys want to chill, I'll be right back.
[283:36.78]I have returned.
[283:42.49]How are you?
[283:49.53]Feels like my computer is going to crash.
[283:51.49]I don't know why.
[283:53.51]Things are slowing down.
[284:07.00]Alright, I got 6.5.
[284:08.80]I just bought a bunch of shit.
[284:11.50]I'm ready.
[284:19.47]Going all in on this one.
[284:27.07]Big crits.
[284:45.03]That definitely counts as an armored enemy because holy shit.
[284:48.86]It's forever.
[285:18.86]Oh, right before chest?
[285:27.60]Shit, that was a stupid idea, but I'm alright.
[285:29.66]I'm okay.
[285:55.80]Good crit.
[286:04.60]Chest right here.
[286:05.22]Yep.
[286:14.61]And... Attack!
[286:42.92]Another key.
[287:06.81]This seems pretty good.
[287:07.95]That was definitely five seconds it had to have been.
[287:10.89]No doubt.
[287:33.20]Nice.
[287:33.44]Each scroll replaces a certain thing.
[287:39.66]Yeah, it's either key.
[287:40.50]I think it replaces only certain.
[287:47.67]6.5 Alright.
[287:52.85]What's the next thing I want from here?
[287:56.81]That's big.
[287:57.35]Yeah.
[288:03.58]Alright.
[288:04.41]Dammit.
[288:04.89]Does the dinosaur count as a dragon?
[288:14.54]Because that would be a big help.
[288:37.09]This is going to be an eight hour stream.
[288:40.19]Highly doubtful.
[288:41.17]I don't know exactly how long this will be, but like I said after yesterday, I kind of was just like I want to play this and I want to stream something.
[288:54.03]Stream after this might be an hour stream that I do next might be six hours.
[288:59.69]We're just going in with whenever I'm feeling it.
[289:02.97]And then when I'm done, I'm done.
[289:05.05]That could be within an hour.
[289:06.11]That could be within four or five.
[289:07.29]It doesn't really doesn't matter.
[289:09.34]I can tell you to absolutely never, ever, ever expect ever again, period, no matter what.
[289:15.24]Anything more than like six hours, probably ever, ever again, truly ever.
[289:23.20]And I, how many, I, I don't know.
[289:34.09]I had this epiphany of just kind of you know trying to be a little more
[290:51.58]Remember when I told you that it felt like my computer was going to crash?
[290:57.12]I think it was OBS.
[290:58.90]OBS crashed.
[291:04.02]That's what it was.
[291:05.14]Two streams in one day?
[291:09.84]Yeah, I think OBS crashed.
[291:19.59]I could feel it hanging, too.
[291:20.87]Why is it so slow?
[291:33.36]Two times only.
[291:34.68]Alright, this is going to be a good one.
[291:37.60]I can feel it.
[291:38.04]Okay.
[291:48.88]Yep.
[291:49.02]That's what I tell you.
[291:50.76]Are you listening to me?
[291:58.12]Ever?
[292:14.61]It's a key.
[292:15.13]Open it.
[292:18.17]I thought it was a chest.
[292:59.70]Shit he's armored emery, and I can't even say armored enemies terrible
[293:20.03]Just die.
[293:36.72]Shit.
[293:45.53]Damn it.
[293:46.55]Why?
[293:47.03]Shit.
[293:51.66]Alright, I'm doing one.
[293:52.62]OK, I got to get I'm going to get to 30,000 experience and I'm good.
[294:06.44]That not count, that was weird.
[294:30.78]Use magic.
[294:41.78]I think I'm going to turn the crit thing back on.
[294:43.38]I feel like I was more confident doing that.
[294:44.90]I feel like I was better.
[294:46.94]Oh, whatever.
[294:54.22]Just do it.
[295:28.47]Two in a row?
[295:30.11]Come on.
[295:30.69]I want better items.
[295:41.40]No, not more keys.
[295:43.67]Get this shit out of here.
[296:05.48]Get rid of these keys.
[296:06.18]I don't want any more keys.
[296:09.28]No more keys.
[296:10.18]Oh.
[296:14.06]It's bad.
[296:18.28]Not a whole lot of weapons right now.
[296:26.11]So many keys.
[296:28.57]Too many keys.
[296:29.77]Literally just way too many keys.
[296:31.71]There's like a hundred keys there.
[296:36.35]Alright.
[296:37.37]$14,000.
[296:37.39]I got money.
[296:42.39]These devs made a third game.
[296:43.99]Did they really?
[296:45.94]What's the third one?
[296:46.64]It is a third game.
[296:57.40]You must build a boat with the second one.
[297:00.07]That was a sequel.
[297:04.41]Uh.
[297:18.33]What was your epiphany?
[297:21.31]Oh, right.
[297:21.81]I didn't really elaborate.
[297:26.31]Oh, you idiot.
[297:27.01]Why did I do that?
[297:28.48]Not you, me.
[297:40.11]Oh, what did I mean by that?
[297:41.53]Hold on.
[297:42.29]This started off really well, hold on.
[298:13.93]These backpacks are kind of dead weight right now, unfortunately.
[298:16.79]I think I'm going to save this stuff for the next run.
[298:35.64]Yeah.
[298:38.34]The third game is called Photographs.
[298:40.50]Interesting.
[298:40.98]Photographs.
[298:49.34]Is it a similar game?
[298:50.26]Like a match three and progress and level up?
[298:59.09]No, it's not.
[298:59.77]Okay.
[299:00.41]Interesting.
[299:14.41]Alright, let's go.
[299:27.54]Good.
[299:40.38]I think naturally just clearing out the other shit, just way more good stuff will drop.
[299:55.43]50 shields, that seems like a lot.
[299:57.25]I should be doing way better.
[300:16.58]Come on, dude.
[300:17.28]What the fuck?
[300:24.81]Uh, key, key, key.
[300:30.41]No.
[300:30.93]It's alright.
[300:39.56]Alright, give me this 5-a-con.
[300:40.70]It's gonna be the... Yep.
[300:46.35]Good shit, perfectly clean run Pretty clean I don't blow it
[301:26.63]Five of kind!
[301:27.39]Five of kind!
[301:34.39]Oh, Jesus.
[301:44.09]Oh, geez.
[301:50.20]Oh, geez.
[302:04.77]Five of a kind.
[302:05.37]Give me a dinosaur.
[302:06.77]I'll take that.
[302:07.63]That's fine.
[302:15.78]Let's go.
[302:16.28]I might get it.
[302:18.46]Big.
[302:38.58]DO SOMETHING!
[302:39.56]Sorry, I probably just startled somebody.
[303:01.73]Damn it!
[303:02.21]Come on, kill him!
[303:03.85]Ah, fuck!
[303:04.67]I was right there!
[303:08.72]Oh, man.
[303:10.98]Seven million, almost six.
[303:12.36]That's a scary number.
[303:17.85]Shit.
[303:22.27]Photographs is a game with multiple similar puzzles in a story.
[303:24.77]Sounds cool.
[303:33.94]That's a very big deal.
[303:37.28]That went up a lot in the last... Hold on a second.
[303:40.20]What's this going to be now?
[303:40.90]Okay, that's kind of huge.
[303:42.66]2,500.
[303:49.47]Yeah, I definitely want the damage to dragons.
[303:57.15]That'll save a lot of time.
[304:01.71]2.4.
[304:02.15]I am going to be... Honestly, I'll make a prediction for you.
[304:05.85]I think in the next five runs, I think we're going to get it.
[304:09.91]I'm going to say five to six more runs.
[304:13.31]Maybe even sooner than that.
[304:14.73]Depends on how lucky it is.
[304:52.77]A lot of stuff spread out.
[305:09.12]I want like a 20 combo.
[305:22.47]Fall it down, what are you doing?
[305:44.98]Too much shit everywhere.
[305:47.42]What a bust of a run.
[305:54.82]At least I can buy the thing.
[306:00.03]2.4.
[306:00.41]Okay.
[306:01.01]I'm almost at the end of the quest.
[306:11.55]Alright.
[306:12.03]Now it's time to turn the rest of this back on.
[306:14.35]Okay.
[306:19.26]I would like to do...
[306:25.49]Keep the crit chance.
[306:27.95]Keep the score.
[306:30.79]Keep the other score too.
[306:32.05]Why not?
[306:32.45]It's going to be harder, but whatever.
[306:36.15]Yeah, leave it.
[306:36.59]Yeah, let's just make it harder and see if we can just beat it.
[306:50.80]What was the epiphany?
[306:52.52]Oh, nothing.
[306:53.30]Nothing that is... Wow, so world changing.
[306:56.74]But... I kind of just... It's not like I haven't said it before.
[307:02.50]But it's just the... Like, why not just play... 10 million for like a few hours?
[307:12.81]Why not?
[307:15.13]Something I felt like doing, so I'm going to do it.
[307:17.97]No plan.
[307:18.45]No nothing.
[307:19.09]Nothing.
[307:39.57]And you have to, you kind of have to get to a level of sort of like, I want to use the word like just go with the flow.
[307:51.53]Set expectations to absolute fucking zero and then just do whatever I feel like doing.
[308:00.87]Hey, set them to zero guys.
[308:32.46]I gotta save these for the dinosaurs.
[308:39.41]It's kind of a shitty run.
[308:55.07]I might be able to pull it together though.
[308:56.13]Hold on.
[309:14.46]Come on.
[309:20.00]I just blew all cooldowns and it didn't matter.
[309:34.22]We'll see it through.
[309:35.08]I don't think it'll take that much longer after this.
[309:38.72]I do need more money though.
[310:19.63]Good.
[310:29.53]No!
[310:37.21]Everybody put your hands up.
[310:38.75]Come on and stand up.
[310:39.69]I'm kind of getting destroyed.
[310:40.79]Hold on.
[310:41.23]What's going on here?
[310:43.83]What is happening here?
[310:50.36]I'll save up for that.
[310:52.64]What's going on here?
[310:58.96]Am I taking too much damage?
[310:59.95]27, 27.
[311:02.15]I'll scratch after this.
[311:28.98]Alright, this is gonna be the one.
[311:29.92]Watch this.
[311:30.50]I'm gonna get to at least 7 million here.
[311:32.00]Check it out.
[311:55.39]At least 7.2 million.
[311:56.19]7.5 million.
[312:27.62]I got to focus on the shields, honestly.
[312:29.24]No, I'm okay.
[312:34.67]Shields are going to be where it's at.
[313:02.06]Give me something to work with.
[313:14.39]Oh my God, give me something to work with.
[313:25.40]Finally, Jesus.
[314:00.57]Alright, I got it.
[314:02.79]This is the biggest multiplier of the night.
[314:06.93]Of the night.
[314:07.33]Who cares?
[314:07.79]Of the night.
[314:10.91]10,000 gold.
[314:12.37]This is going to be the big one right here.
[314:13.53]Take a look at this.
[314:14.17]110 times multiplier.
[314:16.12]Alright, let's do it.
[314:20.54]What should I upgrade?
[314:23.82]Definitely that one.
[314:35.60]Staff.
[314:42.60]Stretching ability.
[314:43.92]I'll get up in a sec.
[314:44.76]Okay.
[314:45.18]Double shields per match and max shields.
[314:47.46]You get no gold, no experience, no wood, and no stone.
[314:51.48]I feel like that's really good though.
[314:53.83]Alright.
[314:58.42]Let's take away the enemy toughness.
[315:01.28]We'll keep this one on.
[315:03.72]And I'm gonna do... I'm gonna do shields.
[315:07.27]We're gonna go shield, uh, build.
[315:20.68]But this can get to about 100.
[315:28.96]You've been playing this for like five hours?
[315:30.76]Yeah.
[315:38.45]Alright, I'm gonna get up.
[315:52.52]He's refusing his stretching.
[316:00.81]Still going to play Withering Rooms?
[316:02.01]Yes.
[316:05.07]Not necessarily for very long.
[316:06.46]I just wanted to show it.
[316:07.94]Because I've already beat it.
[316:09.30]I've already played it.
[316:11.30]I've already gone through the whole thing.
[316:14.60]So it's not new to me.
[316:15.66]But I do want you to see it because I think that you would like it.
[316:18.63]I think you would like it.
[316:33.85]Yeah, I gave Ster the recommendation to play it yesterday, and he told me, he said, that was, I'm not even kidding, some of the most fun I've ever had playing a video game.
[316:44.42]Just brought me back to my childhood days of playing Super Mario 2.
[316:47.76]I was like, wow, yeah.
[317:15.49]Got to play 10 million today.
[317:16.69]This is a good day.
[317:17.86]Alright, five chests.
[317:19.54]That's easy.
[317:19.98]50 tiles in 10 seconds.
[317:21.78]That's not so easy, but it's doable.
[317:24.04]This is very doable.
[317:28.89]Okay, so let's just do it.
[317:50.01]That's a lot of stone.
[317:55.93]Not a whole lot of keys.
[318:06.71]Dude.
[318:08.39]Why did you do that?
[318:10.58]Why did you do that?
[318:14.20]Somebody has to die from poison, right?
[318:15.78]There we go.
[318:39.74]Already at 1 million.
[318:44.38]Oh, you piece of shit.
[318:45.40]Come on.
[318:51.95]Oh, that's sad that that just happened.
[318:53.81]Is that what it just killed this Minotaur?
[319:17.04]Shit, it's okay.
[319:22.18]Alright, I can get that last upgrade.
[319:29.23]That's going to be good.
[319:30.09]And then shields.
[319:34.89]Shit.
[319:43.19]Find five items, open five.
[319:44.83]Okay, find five items would be easy too.
[320:09.95]Good?
[320:10.15]Okay, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[320:15.86]Ah, shit, I have to do that.
[320:38.62]I want to do five of a kind there, shit.
[320:51.49]What are these drops?
[320:53.57]They're terrible.
[321:11.90]I always get like a 10 chain when it doesn't matter.
[321:13.54]Oh, come on, man.
[321:46.92]Strength.
[321:52.92]Oh boy.
[321:54.24]Oh, not good.
[322:04.45]Not good.
[322:10.56]Dragon.
[322:21.48]Fuck!
[322:21.86]I thought I killed him.
[322:31.31]Six or seven more runs?
[322:32.29]I... I... I got... I got to 6.6.
[322:37.06]That's crazy.
[322:52.32]You'll get it in 13 more.
[322:55.38]Hope so.
[323:07.39]I'm not going to gain anything for this, but I'm going to see how well this goes.
[323:22.64]You're probably going to stream more than six hours tonight, today.
[323:24.86]How long has it been so far?
[323:28.42]Five and a half?
[323:29.44]I don't think so.
[323:34.76]I think in the next 20 minutes, I should beat this.
[323:38.82]And then from there, I want to just show you Withering Rooms, because I think it's one of my favorite games of the year.
[323:46.88]And then I'll see you when I see you.
[323:50.66]138, holy shit, that's actually a big deal.
[324:13.24]I don't want to use this, but whatever.
[324:28.51]That shield is amazing.
[324:30.45]That's going to carry this whole thing.
[324:55.72]Come on, man.
[325:05.37]Alright, okay.
[325:07.55]Keys.
[325:11.77]No keys.
[325:12.59]Uh oh.
[325:15.63]Uh oh.
[325:21.60]Oh, not another one.
[325:22.56]Shit.
[325:31.92]Shit.
[325:36.11]Oh, come on.
[325:43.41]Sad.
[325:44.80]Very sad.
[325:45.56]I couldn't get it up there.
[325:54.38]I got to four super quick, yeah.
[326:11.24]I'm right on the cusp for sure.
[326:15.01]So close.
[326:20.55]Five chests.
[326:21.33]Alright, come on.
[326:22.87]I got two axes.
[326:23.71]That'll be good.
[326:33.28]I gotta save the axes for the dragon or the dinosaur.
[326:51.90]Trying to build shields while I can.
[326:53.49]It's a good time to use it, I think.
[327:09.84]No, you idiot!
[327:10.46]I wanted to do the- Ah, whatever.
[327:11.88]I'll be fine.
[327:33.63]Come on, I need something.
[327:34.67]What do I got?
[327:35.19]Nothing.
[328:01.99]I'm glad I got that.
[328:06.92]Good.
[328:07.24]Alright, come on.
[328:07.86]This is it.
[328:08.11]This is the one.
[328:09.25]Look at that.
[328:29.59]Dude, I'm so invested.
[328:30.87]Is he going to do it this run?
[328:33.71]Look at that.
[328:34.05]I'm so invested.
[328:34.73]Okay, come on.
[329:09.12]Mmm, running out of things.
[329:16.38]Oh, boy.
[329:17.42]Come on.
[329:30.55]Perfect lineup.
[329:32.44]Yes.
[329:33.22]Okay, come on.
[329:46.68]That didn't count, why?
[329:47.74]I'm okay, I got one.
[329:57.32]Oh shit, it's gonna be close.
[330:07.65]It's gonna be close.
[330:19.42]Oh shit, it's the dragon.
[330:20.54]Oh, you piece of shit.
[330:29.25]I'm at 9.4 million.
[330:30.07]Oh man.
[330:30.35]9.3 million right there.
[330:31.37]Damn it.
[330:31.53]So close.
[330:49.29]Okay.
[330:50.55]I have to save.
[330:51.47]I gotta save a bunch of shit.
[330:59.21]I'm gonna upgrade this again.
[331:01.55]Well, I can do it.
[331:02.07]Let's go.
[331:06.82]I'm gonna just try to have like four weapons to just boom, boom, boom.
[331:32.36]I'm getting screwed here.
[331:41.71]I think it's going to reset.
[331:43.87]This was dog shit.
[331:45.53]Look at how dog shit this was.
[331:47.63]And I skipped it accidentally.
[331:49.19]This was dog shit.
[331:50.21]Restart it.
[331:50.99]Reset.
[331:53.94]This one doesn't count.
[331:54.46]See?
[331:54.76]Reset it.
[332:40.57]still in it not over yet could be way worse
[332:53.16]I'd love an item though.
[333:01.06]Getting screwed with the keys again.
[333:03.17]Give me a break.
[333:05.13]What is this horse shit?
[333:06.77]It's horse shit.
[333:12.83]Oh my god.
[333:34.07]Okay.
[333:37.49]Alright, we can just pretend I beat it.
[333:39.21]That was cool.
[333:39.78]I beat it.
[333:40.46]I beat 10 million.
[333:41.36]Look at that.
[333:41.72]9 point.
[333:43.80]Round it up.
[333:56.19]You know, it only counts if you beat it.
[333:57.63]Alright, but I beat it.
[333:58.95]Look.
[334:22.64]Okay, good start.
[334:23.34]Let's go.
[334:23.80]I don't know what I'm hitting, but I'm hitting something.
[334:53.99]Food, good.
[335:13.62]Alright, I got weapons.
[335:14.92]I think I'm ready to rock.
[335:27.22]I'll eat that food in a second here.
[335:28.40]I want more room for weapons.
[336:00.79]Come on.
[336:01.23]You guys are a pain in the ass.
[336:17.06]Shit!
[336:18.54]Shit!
[336:29.28]Let's go!
[336:33.18]I just fucked him up so bad.
[336:34.42]Got him.
[336:59.87]Fuck.
[337:00.45]Fuck.
[337:01.13]Fuck.
[337:01.38]Too many things.
[337:03.87]Too much wood!
[337:04.65]Too much wood!
[337:19.22]Do something!
[337:19.78]No, come on!
[337:24.49]Come on!
[337:24.81]No, it's five of a kind!
[337:31.18]Open the chest.
[337:32.26]That was a lot of bullshit for nothing.
[337:34.10]Oh, oh my God.
[337:37.06]And I didn't even get it.
[337:43.09]I think it's got another multiplier though.
[337:55.68]This is the run.
[337:56.78]It's so close.
[338:00.79]It is so close.
[338:01.77]This is maxed out shields.
[338:06.04]I can't believe I didn't open that chest.
[338:07.70]OK, I got full shields.
[338:16.72]I am going to do this because I want better armor.
[338:21.19]Enemies hit 30% harder, but more score, more score, more score.
[338:26.71]Yeah, let's just say, turn it all on.
[338:27.97]Let's say, fuck it.
[338:28.59]I'm going to get lucky and I'm going to beat this right now.
[338:44.90]Two chests back to back is fine.
[339:06.05]I don't want keys, I want weapons.
[339:07.40]Is that a big pie?
[339:23.39]I'm already at 4 million.
[339:45.72]I had to.
[339:50.40]What the fuck are you talking about?
[339:51.54]I just did it!
[339:52.98]Oh my god, it didn't work.
[339:54.10]Alright, don't blow it.
[339:56.45]I'll be fine.
[339:58.03]Didn't even need it.
[340:32.56]What the fuck?
[340:34.70]No, dude, shit.
[340:38.90]Just getting one, two, three dead.
[340:41.78]That was going to be it too if I had any.
[340:43.46]I got to say that dragon is so hard.
[340:46.74]You need at least two or three things to throw at him.
[340:51.15]I did have it though.
[341:05.44]I have money though.
[341:06.25]I should probably do the last upgrades.
[341:25.39]Turn around real easy right here.
[341:49.28]shit that fell in a bad spot alright I pulled it back what are you what's going on I couldn't let it go
[342:32.20]Die already!
[342:55.27]Put some shield on and kill this motherfucker!
[343:05.49]Kill him!
[343:09.68]No!
[343:10.24]It's a five for kind!
[343:16.36]What?
[343:16.58]I was still there!
[343:17.44]I was still standing right there!
[343:18.86]That's a lot of money though, holy shit.
[343:38.09]All in on armor.
[343:53.50]Armor.
[343:56.85]Oh boy.
[343:57.33]Is it going to be like 100 and something percent attack delay?
[344:04.20]Okay, 158% attack delay.
[344:06.47]That is crazy.
[344:08.59]That alone should probably do it.
[344:09.77]Okay, if it doesn't happen now, then it's definitely going to happen... Wait, is there any more of this?
[344:28.75]Completely avoid physical attacks.
[344:30.47]That's kind of awesome.
[344:32.20]Alright, I got everything.
[344:34.61]Alright, this is the one.
[344:39.05]This is it right here.
[344:59.15]Oh, I forgot to do the double shield thing.
[345:00.71]It's my bad.
[345:16.06]Already at 2.4 million.
[345:17.44]Come on.
[345:21.56]Good.
[345:21.90]I'm going to save that.
[345:22.60]Don't use it.
[345:25.12]Save that.
[345:25.60]Don't use that either.
[345:26.51]Holy shit.
[345:27.75]That is a 15 chain.
[345:29.61]I am zooming.
[345:58.65]I can't use it here.
[346:00.17]I'll use this though.
[346:03.65]Good.
[346:03.97]Okay.
[346:09.50]No, I need to, I need more.
[346:10.56]That was a four of a kind.
[346:11.48]They're throwing a bunch of bullshit at me right in a row here.
[346:32.69]I had to do it just to get it.
[346:34.35]What the?
[346:35.32]Jared, what are you doing?
[346:36.96]I don't know.
[347:25.69]Open the fu- I couldn't get it out of time.
[347:28.79]Shit.
[347:31.90]God damn it.
[347:34.26]I get right to the finish line and then I stop.
[347:37.20]And I'm like, you know, hold on.
[347:39.86]Do I really want to take that final step over the finish line?
[347:42.38]I'm not so sure.
[347:43.44]Ugh.
[347:48.95]I got it right here.
[347:49.61]Come on.
[347:51.65]The potion is, yeah, I got to get the potion turned on.
[347:54.27]Okay.
[347:58.53]That's the problem.
[347:59.63]That was the problem.
[348:03.12]Now I'm ready.
[348:03.96]15 big crits.
[348:07.42]Let's do it.
[348:34.95]Speed here.
[348:35.43]There we go.
[349:10.87]That was a shitload of wood.
[349:12.23]Probably a chest right here.
[349:31.95]Nope.
[349:32.61]Failed.
[349:43.49]Any more shields right now?
[350:15.29]I'm good.
[350:32.37]Where are all the fucking combos?
[350:46.74]Okay.
[351:22.07]You're going to give me a fucking dragon right here, dude.
[351:24.40]What are you fucking talking about?
[351:37.68]You're going to give me a dragon right in front of that door.
[351:39.63]9.4 million.
[351:41.27]I'm going to get a dragon.
[351:42.03]Shit.
[351:52.87]I thought I already got through the dragon I needed to get through.
[351:54.97]This is kind of ass.
[352:10.80]That's an ass start, by the way.
[352:24.29]It's been six hours.
[352:25.07]Yeah, I'll be fine.
[352:30.96]I'll be alright.
[352:31.36]I've been stretching.
[352:59.45]Wish I could get some more shit.
[353:05.47]That's not helping.
[353:06.35]Oh, you gotta get like a 10 chain.
[353:25.27]Alright, now I need more weapons.
[353:28.20]I gotta have three more weapons.
[353:50.62]This is bad.
[353:56.08]Lost a lot of time there.
[353:57.06]That sucks.
[354:19.25]I gotta use it.
[354:19.85]I have nothing.
[354:20.15]Oh, come on.
[354:39.92]What the fuck?
[354:42.18]God damn it!
[354:43.42]Alright, one more try and then I'm just gonna move on.
[354:50.91]It's a lot of RNG at the end, and I'll get it eventually.
[355:26.29]That's not what I wanted to do.
[355:27.23]I went one tile too far.
[355:45.18]Move something!
[356:01.34]He's got to keep making matches.
[356:53.87]These dragons suck!
[356:58.82]Do it!
[357:15.49]I think I gotta take off one of the potions.
[357:18.17]I'm taking so much more damage.
[357:21.27]50% more toughness, 30% harder, 25% less damage.
[357:25.63]Alright.
[357:29.63]That one's going off.
[357:32.23]That has to go off.
[357:37.84]That just ain't doable.
[357:39.10]Okay.
[357:49.97]Trying to make a little bit more money.
[357:55.91]For one day only.
[358:03.59]Okay, this is going to be the one.
[358:06.00]50% toughness on enemies.
[358:07.20]Look at this.
[358:07.86]Look at how ridiculous that was.
[358:11.34]People are dying so much faster.
[358:38.65]I don't know what's going on.
[358:59.59]I just know I'm winning.
[359:03.63]I think I'm winning.
[359:04.45]I think so.
[359:23.77]Stay right up front.
[359:34.48]Good.
[359:43.66]Yes!
[360:22.93]What the fuck is happening?
[360:25.55]Oh my god!
[360:56.20]10 million.
[360:58.44]I got it.
[361:00.36]10 million.
[361:00.94]Hey, look at that.
[361:07.90]I did it.
[361:08.50]Let's keep going.
[361:10.86]11 million.
[361:12.12]12 million.
[361:13.26]13 million.
[361:21.69]I might be able to take this to like 12.
[361:37.12]Oh shit, another dragon.
[361:38.10]It's going faster too.
[361:45.68]Just get a few more hits in.
[361:47.32]Oh, I don't know where to go.
[361:48.18]I did it.
[361:52.94]Cool.
[362:07.13]15 million.
[362:12.47]Oh, next rank.
[362:16.39]It has to be 1.5 million or I'm going to freak up.
[362:23.62]Oh, thank God, OK.
[362:35.61]I think that's it.
[362:36.97]I think I just ran out of gas right there.
[362:40.11]Oh, maybe not.
[362:42.37]Oh, maybe not.
[362:44.27]Yes, 1.7 million.
[362:45.99]Oh, no, sorry.
[362:46.39]It's 17 million.
[362:50.17]If you make a game, don't name it 10 million.
[362:58.36]Yeah.
[363:02.66]I'm free.
[363:17.74]I love this game, it's fun.
[363:21.64]Three hours and 32 minutes?
[363:24.98]Did I spend an hour and a half stretching?
[363:26.72]Or more?
[363:28.00]What?
[363:36.51]As Mario would say, biahoo!
[363:47.24]Oh, three hours actually in runs, I see.
[363:52.14]So there is a sequel.
[363:54.26]We're not going to play that right now, but... I do want to show you before I go.
[363:59.17]Although this is interesting information.
[364:17.48]Yeah, it's called You Must Build a Boat is the sequel.
[364:19.52]This is 10 million.
[364:23.69]It is an all-time classic.
[364:31.19]Why did you call this a games and demos stream?
[364:34.27]Because I really didn't know what I was going to play.
[364:38.61]10 million was kind of like on the brain.
[364:40.01]So I was like, maybe I'll do that.
[364:40.91]Maybe I'll show Withering Rooms and I got into this.
[364:47.06]But I do want to show Withering Rooms.
[364:53.43]I will never have a stream more than six hours again, he said at a six hour stream.
[364:59.37]Yeah, but you know what I mean by that.
[365:02.49]There it is, 10 million.
[365:03.47]It's a great game.
[365:04.43]And it's equal.
[365:07.11]Alright, let me gush about Withering Rooms for just like five to ten minutes.
[365:11.00]I'll show it to you.
[365:15.88]Uh...
[365:17.32]Yeah, give me one sec.
[365:27.18]Okay.
[365:30.42]Yeah, so Withering Rooms is a game.
[365:34.67]I'll open it up.
[365:35.55]Music is great.
[365:38.39]The combat is good.
[365:43.43]Combat takes a little getting used to.
[365:44.73]It's a little wonky.
[365:46.05]It feels a little weird.
[365:47.69]The whole game feels weird.
[365:48.79]The whole game just feels odd.
[365:51.57]But that's kind of why I like it.
[365:53.49]It is a really fun system.
[365:56.30]I'll show it to you.
[366:07.47]I'm not going to play through the whole thing.
[366:08.69]I'm just going to run around so you can see it.
[366:23.59]Bonus game?
[366:24.51]Yeah.
[366:25.83]So, we'll just do a new game.
[366:28.87]I'm only going to do this for like 20 minutes, but I really want to... You all should play this.
[366:35.02]It's very good.
[366:44.84]It has roguelike elements?
[366:47.55]Dude, he said roguelike?
[366:48.59]That must... Oh my god, that must mean it's a fucking fantastic game.
[366:51.53]He said the magic words.
[366:58.02]Nightingale is sent to Mostyn private asylum by her father.
[367:02.22]New patients must spend their first night at the gatehouse for observation.
[367:06.76]It is there that Nightingale first awakens in the dream.
[367:18.67]So it's a side-scrolling game.
[367:20.03]Like this.
[367:22.67]You can interact with furniture.
[367:23.87]There's a dodge roll.
[367:33.45]The game is kind of scary.
[367:36.93]I'm going to tell you.
[367:37.79]I'm going to warn you.
[367:40.93]I'm just going to start playing through this.
[367:47.95]Can't open from this side.
[367:51.17]Search.
[367:52.53]Two coins.
[367:53.42]There is a currency.
[367:54.26]But yeah.
[368:01.84]I forget what the run button is.
[368:12.39]You're supposed to explore.
[368:13.31]Yeah.
[368:16.10]I laughed at Ster at this part.
[368:19.16]Corpse in a cage.
[368:20.28]It's blocking a hole in the wall.
[368:24.68]Some furniture can be used to hide.
[368:27.34]Like that.
[368:34.69]It's kind of like Clock Tower and Silent Hill and Dark Souls and Resident Evil and...
[368:42.45]Something else.
[368:56.31]Grandfather clock.
[368:56.99]There's a keyhole in front.
[368:58.00]I have already played through this.
[368:59.72]I unfortunately, this is not going to be a blind play through.
[369:06.64]You can peek through doors.
[369:08.62]There is a leveling system.
[369:10.64]There's lore.
[369:11.90]Lore is actually really interesting.
[369:13.26]It's a really, really cool storyline.
[369:14.96]Full walkthrough now.
[369:24.23]Now he's just doing a playthrough.
[369:31.87]Actually reads the lore.
[369:32.93]Yeah, in this one.
[369:35.17]Patient information.
[369:35.97]Patient Millie Erwood.
[369:37.25]13.
[369:38.25]Emma Baynon.
[369:41.52]Fires.
[369:41.98]Inappropriate behavior.
[369:43.96]Disagreeableness.
[369:44.80]Headaches.
[369:48.06]Interesting stuff.
[369:49.28]Maybe you can unravel the mysteries of Withering Rooms.
[370:05.71]I will say, I do have to warn you, it does take about an hour to really get going.
[370:11.71]If you can give this game an hour, you'll be very happy.
[370:23.92]It's the funniest movie of the year.
[370:29.76]You are so much better at this than jigsaw puzzles.
[370:36.93]Oh, the misery.
[370:48.13]Once I get a weapon, you'll see kind of what I'm talking about.
[370:49.95]And the one cool thing, one of the really cool things about this game, when you die, you lose all your items just like your favorite game, Minecraft.
[371:00.22]I know a lot of you love that game.
[371:01.90]Minecraft.
[371:03.18]Minecraft.
[371:15.76]Wait, I need to look for stuff.
[371:16.88]You want to search everything.
[371:24.37]A white sigil above the doorway indicates enemies cannot pass through.
[371:27.39]This is safe.
[371:28.69]So there are safe areas.
[371:40.12]Entrance hall.
[371:40.84]So, and by the way, I am not kidding around.
[371:44.75]This game is probably my game of the year.
[371:47.58]Not fucking around.
[371:49.28]Do you think I'm fucking around?
[371:50.80]Do you hear the tone of my voice?
[371:52.04]I'm not fucking with you.
[371:58.20]Where's the map?
[371:59.32]There's an in-game map I know.
[372:09.05]Oh shit.
[372:09.79]Got you now.
[372:13.23]You wouldn't dare.
[372:17.20]Don't I have the gatehouse key?
[372:18.70]Yeah, I went out.
[372:19.22]Oh, hold on.
[372:19.62]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[372:20.10]I want to go this way.
[372:25.64]I need a weapon.
[372:29.60]What the fuck?
[372:30.54]Holy shit.
[372:31.12]That was a new enemy.
[372:33.50]The new enemy ability.
[372:34.82]Teleport.
[372:42.09]Where's the map?
[372:42.67]How do I get the map up here?
[372:46.25]Yeah, you can put the map on the screen.
[372:47.65]Did somebody have to talk to you?
[372:51.27]I forget.
[372:51.57]You have to talk to somebody.
[372:58.65]I want to put the map on the screen.
[373:01.59]Down, okay.
[373:03.73]I think I was going the right way.
[373:04.59]If I remember.
[373:07.61]It's been... Yeah, the key to the front door of the mansion is... Yeah, I think I should go back outside.
[373:15.32]I mean, where's the controls?
[373:20.09]Run as hold, crouch, aim as hold.
[373:21.73]Hold binding.
[373:22.75]Oh, there we go.
[373:27.67]Okay.
[373:30.05]Yeah, where is it?
[373:31.86]Hide, peek, dodge, combat stance.
[373:36.08]Pause menu, toggle.
[373:37.40]Okay, M is the minimap or right stick button.
[373:47.97]Uh.
[373:50.01]Maybe I don't have it unlocked yet.
[373:52.13]Could be right stick button.
[373:56.07]I guess I could just press.
[373:56.97]I guess I can't do it yet.
[374:03.22]How does he not know how to play his favorite game?
[374:05.02]I do know how to play my favorite game, but it's easy to get lost.
[374:12.46]I gotta get this silly child.
[374:16.21]I was doing that thing where I was just talking and walking in a direction and I don't even know where I ended up.
[374:23.70]Okay, yeah, down here.
[374:28.78]Yeah, okay, there we go.
[374:33.07]He's getting defensive about his favorite game.
[374:44.16]Red wax.
[374:45.58]You can make stuff.
[374:47.02]There's crafting.
[374:50.02]There's a whole cast of characters.
[374:55.72]You look lost first time in the dream.
[374:58.68]I'm Becca.
[374:59.16]I'm afraid you've stumbled into something you probably shouldn't have.
[375:03.30]We're having a sort of celebration to welcome a new member of our little club.
[375:08.13]You see, we're witches in the dreary waking world.
[375:12.93]There's no magic but here.
[375:14.93]Did my computer crash?
[375:16.61]Oh no, we're good.
[375:27.06]Okay, when I am in this window, Twitch chat stops.
[375:33.09]So I can't see what you're saying.
[375:36.61]I'm sure it's all terribly confusing.
[375:38.89]Need to go talk to the first witch.
[375:40.63]She's our leader.
[375:42.23]You'll find her up ahead by the fireplace.
[375:44.33]Just answer any questions she has truthfully and I'm sure everything will be fine.
[375:47.93]Feel free to grab a slice of cake.
[375:49.71]It's delicious.
[375:53.21]Get items.
[375:56.45]There are items in this game.
[376:02.80]You're not supposed to be here.
[376:04.34]Are you a patient here at Mostyn Private Asylum?
[376:06.54]Yes.
[376:07.39]Hmm.
[376:08.25]Did you come from the gatehouse?
[376:09.43]Yes.
[376:10.17]Hmm.
[376:11.03]You made it all the way here with no assistance.
[376:13.45]Yes.
[376:14.37]Liar.
[376:17.05]Well, that's a bad ending.
[376:17.91]I got the bad ending and... Okay, well, I'm sorry that I showed the game like this because I just got the bad ending.
[376:24.19]I was rushing.
[376:25.05]I was going a little too fast.
[376:27.77]I...
[376:33.54]Oh, you're supposed to die.
[376:35.22]It's a very short game.
[376:44.14]I disagree.
[376:44.66]I think it's like 20 took me about 20 hours, 25 hours.
[376:48.44]Alright, so now we start to play the game.
[376:56.65]For real.
[377:04.54]That's locked.
[377:05.16]I think I have to talk to somebody first though.
[377:08.24]Cleaver.
[377:12.60]Take a look at this.
[377:13.14]You thought it was all about just running away?
[377:21.25]You could be a melee build.
[377:22.59]You could be a caster.
[377:23.75]You could be a speed build.
[377:34.61]Is this like a 2D Souls-like?
[377:37.81]I... It's hard to even answer that question because one of the reasons why I like this game so much is because it's kind of just... Whatever it is.
[377:46.76]It's kind of its own thing.
[377:49.74]It's that kind of... It's kind of off-putting in a lot of ways.
[377:52.04]Like the game is just sort of kind of weird.
[377:54.42]Things like just feel weird.
[377:55.68]The game feels like it just... Sometimes it plays.
[377:58.04]Sometimes the game kind of like feels like it's fighting you in a way.
[377:59.96]It's like, what the fuck?
[378:00.68]How come it didn't work?
[378:03.78]The roughness of some of the stuff in the game is why I like it.
[378:06.44]It kind of adds to it.
[378:15.39]All the different characters have their own charm.
[378:18.52]I very much enjoy it.
[378:19.52]It's called Withering Rooms.
[378:31.91]Yeah, you can level up.
[378:32.82]There's a whole thing.
[378:35.36]I'll show a little bit more once we get out of this room, just so you can see kind of what the actual gameplay loop feels like.
[378:42.59]Your name is Nightingale, it is.
[378:43.79]And we just apologize for you being set on fire as soon as you arrived here.
[378:48.97]I assure you, the responsible party has been severely reprimanded.
[378:53.30]Another really cool thing about this game, it's just a little kind of extra little piece.
[378:58.96]All the different characters, they don't have voice lines, but all their font is different.
[379:03.12]Every character in this game has a different font.
[379:06.01]Which is, I don't know, it's just cool.
[379:08.05]Neat idea.
[379:13.24]I can assure you it is not.
[379:14.38]You've been drawn into a phenomenon unique to Mostenhaus.
[379:17.65]Sort of a dream or a nightmare.
[379:18.99]Weeks will pass here during a single night in the real world.
[379:21.03]I'm sure you have questions.
[379:22.77]I don't know why I'm reading this like a newscaster.
[379:25.37]I'll answer as best as I'm able to.
[379:29.79]It's like you can ask about how do you get out of here, the methodology for waking up in the dream is not well understood.
[379:35.08]Some wake with ease with only a vague memory of what occurred.
[379:39.03]Others are trapped indefinitely, their comatose body slowly rotting in the real world.
[379:46.72]Dying in the dream provides no release.
[379:49.14]You'll simply awake anew.
[379:51.66]Very dangerous.
[379:53.94]As those trapped in the dream are not in the real world, they turn into deranged living corpses here.
[379:59.53]Unfortunately, dream accumulates more such unpleasant residents each year.
[380:03.35]As such, it's critical that you avoid attention until you are properly armed with tools to defend yourself.
[380:10.37]Dying in the dream is a temporary affair.
[380:12.95]The experience is still horrible, so you must be careful.
[380:17.97]And there's magic!
[380:18.55]But remarkably, in the dream, magic is real.
[380:22.50]I'm a magic... I'm a novice magic user.
[380:24.58]You'll want to seek out the filthy wretch to learn more.
[380:44.38]Okay.
[380:45.78]The mansion reconfigures itself each night, but you should be able to find me in the study easily enough.
[380:50.50]I'll leave you with the key to this room and make my exit.
[380:54.23]Oh, don't be discouraged if you die.
[380:57.01]As you have already seen, it's only temporary.
[380:59.49]Sounds perverse, but death really is the greatest teacher.
[381:02.69]See you around.
[381:05.07]Yeah.
[381:07.41]So there we go.
[381:08.61]Alright.
[381:09.09]So as you can see, new quest is meet Margaret in the study.
[381:14.52]We have notes.
[381:15.52]We have stuff you can do.
[381:16.70]Stuff you can look at.
[381:20.20]Each room has... I see strange bedroom.
[381:25.12]Question mark means that there's something here to look at still.
[381:30.00]So for instance, see like hide.
[381:31.46]Oh, what the hell?
[381:32.08]What's this thing?
[381:34.07]What else is in here?
[381:34.83]How come I'm getting a notification that I can still do stuff?
[381:39.87]That's because it's this.
[381:40.63]The grandfather clock.
[381:45.60]Dude, you can look at stuff in this game?
[381:47.62]No way!
[381:48.28]Alright, let's go kick somebody's ass.
[381:51.48]Photograph a dry plate?
[382:02.27]Dude, I can't wait to get this on your recommendation.
[382:04.23]You can look at shit.
[382:10.37]Yeah, see the mini map up there is... Oh boy.
[382:15.49]I can't lose to the first enemy.
[382:27.34]Good.
[382:32.52]And that's how you get your first kill.
[382:34.38]And that's how you get your first kill.
[382:38.26]Empty jar.
[382:41.10]Various liquids.
[382:44.86]and then a corrupted finger every time you kill somebody if it's somebody you haven't seen before it gives you a little brief description of their resistances their tolerances and they might have some money but it's really fun just to kind of explore
[383:05.25]Because, I don't know, they're just like, oh, go talk to somebody in the study eventually.
[383:08.45]Oh, okay.
[383:09.15]What else can I do?
[383:09.73]Oh, this one's locked.
[383:11.57]Why?
[383:11.83]How do I get- I want to get in there.
[383:14.15]Well, you can't.
[383:14.75]When?
[383:15.31]Maybe later.
[383:16.07]How?
[383:16.99]You'll find out.
[383:17.59]Okay, that's an NPC room.
[383:30.09]Oh, it wants me to do this.
[383:33.84]Yeah, you can hold things in... you have a left hand and a right hand.
[383:41.27]What's in there?
[383:49.25]What's in this one?
[383:52.91]Oops.
[384:03.97]Alright, that guy has a gun, by the way.
[384:05.66]Gun.
[384:06.78]Yes, there are guns.
[384:12.14]And if you're... And I don't want to spoil anything.
[384:14.90]But to answer your question, the answer is yes.
[384:17.36]Okay?
[384:18.12]I'm not going to spoil anything, but the answer is yes.
[384:20.68]Oh, shit.
[384:25.36]Oh, shit.
[384:37.07]No, I can't die in my favorite game of the year.
[384:38.95]I can't die in my favorite game of the year yet.
[384:40.29]Not yet.
[384:40.51]I don't think I have any healing yet either.
[384:51.70]No.
[384:51.88]Okay.
[385:00.18]Well, that thing is out here.
[385:11.68]Why is everybody pulled?
[385:13.16]I just heard a gunshot.
[385:18.86]I think he just shot somebody.
[385:21.45]Spectacular, isn't it?
[385:23.57]Good evening.
[385:25.15]I'd introduce myself, but people don't generally wear masks if they want their identity to be known.
[385:31.70]I've been here so long I can scarce remember who I was previously anyway.
[385:37.68]I no longer have the patience to beat back the ever-growing throngs of animated corpses in this house.
[385:43.51]As such, I have become something of a merchant, and traffic in all sorts of goods in my inventory is always changing.
[385:50.73]What good is gold in this nightmare?
[385:53.01]A coin is available, sir, for later.
[385:58.10]Hey, a merchant.
[385:59.74]There's rings.
[386:00.86]There's weapons.
[386:01.92]There's spells.
[386:02.92]There's candles.
[386:04.66]Actually, I can only buy one of these.
[386:06.10]This is just a health kit.
[386:18.90]Doesn't heal very much.
[386:26.15]You can take the cover off the mirror if you want.
[386:28.63]Who knows what that's for?
[386:30.15]I think I'm just gonna die out here.
[386:31.21]Because, uh... Like, I pulled the entire... The entire floor.
[386:45.38]Why is this person dead?
[386:48.94]Oh, he shot this person.
[386:49.98]Okay.
[386:51.34]Blank scroll to craft spells.
[386:56.59]Bandage and then a description.
[387:13.32]He's never going to make it to Mega Satan.
[387:18.59]Yeah, that's for bleeding.
[387:19.61]There's bleeding, there's poison, there's magic damage too.
[387:21.91]There's fire damage.
[387:23.63]Burning.
[387:27.78]I need to talk to somebody.
[387:28.80]But let's look in here.
[387:31.62]Who's in here?
[387:32.14]I hope you don't walk out the front door.
[387:43.68]I'll fight it.
[387:44.78]Why not?
[387:45.70]Let me prove I'm a gamer.
[388:26.71]Shit!
[388:27.45]Mistimed it.
[388:31.83]Come on, Swank!
[388:38.80]Ooh!
[388:39.64]You hit me right in the face!
[388:57.08]I can't do it.
[388:57.96]I can't do it.
[388:58.42]I don't have enough health.
[388:59.26]I did.
[389:19.30]Why did you hold still?
[389:20.20]I don't know.
[389:21.26]I figured it was there.
[389:21.97]Alright, so I just died.
[389:23.69]All my shit is gone.
[389:25.41]There is a way to remember items.
[389:27.09]I did get a present.
[389:34.53]I got some money.
[389:36.22]And a pipe.
[389:37.86]New weapon.
[389:41.98]You'll notice that the world is reset.
[389:46.79]But everything is kind of in a similar place.
[389:48.98]It just kind of jumbled around.
[389:51.04]And it's not... See, like, there's a knife in this.
[389:54.50]There wasn't a knife in here last time.
[390:06.97]But the world is very big.
[390:10.25]It's a large game.
[390:13.70]There are multiple chapters.
[390:15.96]I think there's like five or six chapters.
[390:18.30]There's a lot.
[390:21.66]And I'm kind of just running around like a lunatic.
[390:27.97]There is a rhyme and a reason to everything in the game.
[390:30.43]Maybe I should put the knife on.
[390:47.46]But it definitely scratches an itch.
[390:52.04]It has that kind of new game smell.
[390:54.00]And not just new game smell, but like unique game smell.
[391:05.55]It's really cool, but it's not Among Us.
[391:09.28]How do I permanently ban every single one of you?
[391:18.05]This says faster?
[391:19.29]Yeah.
[391:29.30]So I gotta go to the study.
[391:31.02]Which I think it's... You don't have to go in rooms.
[391:33.46]You don't have to clear any of this if you don't really want to.
[391:36.70]But some stuff does require it.
[391:38.28]The guy that sells stuff.
[391:44.09]Guest bedroom.
[391:44.77]Alright, let me kill this guy.
[392:01.75]I'm trying to rush too fast through the game.
[392:10.16]I'm trying to rush too fast.
[392:11.36]I want you to see it so bad that I'm like rushing.
[392:13.92]Ooh, a present.
[392:21.47]20% melee damage ring?
[392:22.79]Are you fucking kidding me?
[392:30.63]Okay, well there's a pipe.
[392:39.84]Yeah, it's a lot more of this.
[392:42.28]Just different in areas.
[392:43.54]And there is a cool mechanic that you haven't seen yet that they introduce.
[392:48.00]That makes the game, I want to say, very scary.
[392:50.35]There's a chest in here.
[392:55.93]I'm going in.
[392:56.33]Alright, I'm not going to fuck around this time.
[393:00.54]Oh, it's a... puzzle.
[393:15.24]I need money.
[393:21.44]The wax is very useful.
[393:22.74]You end up making a ton of spells.
[393:26.38]Alright, foul intent filled the streets of Trist.
[393:29.54]Before the horror began, the city had eight sailors, 15 bishops, and six barbers.
[393:34.59]On the following day, two barbers slit their wrists.
[393:37.69]Next, each barber ate two bishops.
[393:40.61]Then three sailors jumped to their deaths.
[393:43.47]In Trist, only a few sailors, bishops, and barbers remained.
[393:48.49]Okay, this is a math problem.
[393:53.02]Okay, there are 8 sailors, 15 bishops, 6 barbers.
[393:57.81]That would be 4 barbers left.
[394:02.67]And there'd be 13 bishops, 4 barbers.
[394:09.34]And then 5.
[394:09.76]So 5, 13, 4.
[394:12.44]5, 13, 4.
[394:12.80]5, 13, 4.
[394:25.41]Each where was it each?
[394:35.96]Was it bro?
[394:37.44]Can you get an RPG in this game?
[394:42.70]I actually don't know, maybe.
[394:49.71]Yeah, it's.
[394:53.89]Each.
[394:55.74]Hey, look, a key!
[394:56.52]A key to the occult library.
[394:59.18]What is a 985?
[395:00.08]Math is hard.
[395:00.64]What the fuck?
[395:13.34]Three coins.
[395:14.48]People can fucking hide in these things.
[395:18.18]There's cool lore.
[395:20.02]I'm gonna let you be the one that reads that.
[395:26.41]Yeah, if a room has a question mark, it means there is something for you to still do.
[395:31.33]Whether it's an item that you haven't found.
[395:33.13]Whether it's a thing that you have to do.
[395:36.53]Alright, I'm killing this guy once and for all.
[395:44.04]Peter?
[395:44.98]Got you now.
[395:47.44]Silly child.
[395:52.14]Okay, got him.
[395:55.78]Free coins.
[395:56.40]Now let me go heal.
[395:57.48]Oh wait, there's something in there.
[396:03.02]You should play the rest of the game.
[396:06.52]Hey, look, a heal.
[396:10.86]I, um, no, probably not.
[396:13.32]I've just, I mean, I've played it.
[396:16.14]I'm showing this to you because I am telling you that you'll probably enjoy this.
[396:22.89]Or maybe you won't, but it is a certain type of game.
[396:26.95]It's a very particular type of video game.
[396:31.75]But when you get really powerful, it's really fun.
[396:35.35]Two first aid kits.
[396:36.59]Okay, this is the study.
[396:42.64]It's not just this one environment either.
[396:44.06]There's a ton of places to go.
[396:51.14]Gives you a ring.
[396:58.92]What is the ring that she gives you?
[397:00.26]Oh, plus 10 max health, plus 25% bleed resist.
[397:02.75]You can have up to four rings on it at the same time.
[397:06.31]And the music is great.
[397:24.75]You have a quest log.
[397:26.91]Just here.
[397:27.40]Find the filthy wretch in the occult library.
[397:30.20]The key can be found in one of the bedrooms.
[397:31.74]Yeah.
[397:36.32]Let's see.
[397:36.68]Wait, I will play until I get to my favorite song and then I'll stop the stream when I get to my favorite song.
[397:41.34]Does that sound good?
[397:52.31]So this is where you get taught a few different mechanics.
[397:55.04]There's some cool, there's some lore.
[397:57.32]The lore is, let me actually show that to you because it's very important.
[398:02.47]Where's the notes?
[398:06.63]Yeah, here we go.
[398:08.19]There's perception, poise, speed, and luck.
[398:10.50]They all do different things.
[398:15.39]Perception increases.
[398:16.21]The unit can see spirits from further distance and detect increasingly sophisticated hexes and illusions.
[398:21.98]It's poise.
[398:23.60]Speed value 115.
[398:26.18]All actions 15% faster.
[398:27.48]And then there's luck.
[398:32.64]Let's get to my favorite song.
[398:35.22]I don't have a name exactly, but most folks around here call me the Filthy Wretch.
[398:38.28]I consider myself a tutor of sorts in the occult arts.
[398:42.26]You seem like you would make a fine student.
[398:44.06]Before we get started, I have one small request.
[398:47.54]You might be off-putting.
[398:49.24]Bring me a corrupted finger.
[398:50.89]Don't look so scandalized.
[398:54.57]You don't even know what it's for.
[398:56.75]I'd suggest targeting one of the sleeping zombies.
[398:58.87]I appreciate this is an unusual and difficult request, but I assure you now the end result will be worth it.
[399:05.37]I think I already have one, I do.
[399:08.75]What I'd like you to do is eat the finger.
[399:10.98]Just kidding.
[399:13.33]body parts are a valuable commodity with many uses see the stone shrine in this room a curious ancient thing place the finger into its basin to activate it it'll help you remember items you might otherwise have forgotten each night you'll find shrines like these throughout the mansion just as no two people are alike so are the shrines each one will require a different offering to activate so what this does is now
[399:41.21]If we turn this on there, these are scattered around the whole world.
[399:45.73]If we die.
[399:46.43]We get to keep something.
[399:50.64]I'm gonna say it's probably this.
[399:53.92]So now when I die, this is in my inventory permanently.
[399:59.82]I feel like melee weapons are pretty easy to come across very early.
[400:08.29]Oh, let's pin a chat message.
[400:11.01]The game is Withering Rooms.
[400:25.50]On Steam.
[400:26.25]I think it's also on PS5 and maybe Xbox.
[400:28.91]And that...
[400:44.51]Pin this with the middle finger?
[400:47.65]Yeah, this is where you start cooking, start making shit, start making potions, start crafting.
[401:02.51]Okay.
[401:05.19]Next lesson is casting spells.
[401:08.07]There is magic.
[401:09.43]Take this blue scroll.
[401:10.82]Yes, there is spell power.
[401:12.60]You can increase it.
[401:15.76]Using magic will cause one to become slightly cursed.
[401:18.46]You have two different health bars in this game.
[401:20.30]You have a health bar and a curse bar.
[401:22.21]The more the curse bar goes up, look out, because shit gets weird.
[401:34.45]His neurons are paying him dopamine to play this game and I'm all for it.
[401:41.82]It's very good.
[401:45.58]This is one of those like trust me bro moments.
[401:49.59]Let me each spell is at one single use.
[401:54.31]That gives you like a little bit of extra armor.
[402:01.78]And then you need a... How do you even say that word?
[402:06.60]Grimoire.
[402:07.09]You may have.
[402:08.51]Is it Grimoire?
[402:17.17]Use Starlight, kid.
[402:20.49]Now we can craft.
[402:21.37]We need blank scrolls to craft.
[402:25.17]This is what the wax is for.
[402:28.52]See, it's one blank scroll, one blue wax.
[402:30.40]I can make one, I can make a few.
[402:33.72]And now I have, how many, two or three?
[402:38.01]There it is.
[402:40.17]Stick it on the quick menu.
[402:42.91]And then, oops, a daisy.
[402:45.15]Well, actually, that's good.
[402:45.91]I have full health now.
[402:48.15]Now it's right there.
[402:49.39]It's equipped.
[402:49.91]Do I not even have a weapon?
[402:54.89]Alright, continue your studies in the cult.
[402:56.11]You need to find the first witch in the basement.
[402:58.21]Here is the key to the stairwell.
[403:03.59]All the lights are out.
[403:04.49]It's very scary.
[403:06.77]Alright, now it's time for you to hear my favorite song.
[403:15.72]Uh, where is a mirror?
[403:21.84]Down here.
[403:34.33]When I see something cool.
[403:47.49]Shit gets weird when you have high curse.
[403:50.82]Game kind of changes.
[403:53.72]It gets really fucking weird.
[403:56.96]But.
[403:58.98]Portal to nowhere.
[403:59.76]Favorite song time.
[404:06.26]Favorite song time, turn it up.
[404:09.59]It's already up.
[405:06.21]there's like three versions of the song I like this one uh this is I don't you you can figure it out
[405:26.39]It's a whole lot to figure out.
[405:27.61]Which is, it's a different kind of experience.
[405:30.15]Where you're just like, oh shit, this is cool.
[405:32.53]I like this.
[405:34.37]Doesn't have to be like 10,000 fucking damage numbers.
[405:38.65]Doesn't have to be a bunch of shit.
[405:41.66]A bunch of like, oh, it's got to be like this.
[405:43.34]It's got to be this graphics.
[405:45.28]Just play it.
[405:47.48]Enjoy it.
[405:56.47]And I'll leave you with that.
[406:01.21]Ster was playing this yesterday.
[406:02.37]If you watch Ster's VOD, you'll see an actual blind playthrough.
[406:07.91]I don't know if he's going to keep playing it.
[406:09.89]He might play it.
[406:11.75]I don't know.
[406:13.93]But... Highly recommend it.
[406:17.04]I think it's up there for Game of the Year.
[406:18.16]That and Balatro.
[406:19.96]So far.
[406:20.72]Into May.
[406:24.28]But yeah, that's it.
[406:25.76]I mean, I've been live for a long time, but whatever.
[406:28.44]I'm just here.
[406:28.88]Felt like it.
[406:32.09]After streaming yesterday, I kind of was like, I felt like kind of hanging out, but just kind of took off.
[406:38.20]I had some time today, so.
[406:43.36]that and again I I don't know like I if I feel like it I feel like it if I don't I don't that's all there is to it I made this reference I'm going to make this reference because I kind of think I want to put it as like a exclamation point kind of thing this is a perfect way to describe this
[407:03.55]So you know when you beat a game, you get to the last boss, and you complete it, and you're like, holy shit, I beat the game.
[407:11.53]I got to the end of the game.
[407:13.31]And then it kind of boots you out into the open world.
[407:17.65]Like, oh, you just beat the boss.
[407:20.13]You can kind of just do whatever you want, like in the open world.
[407:23.97]And if you didn't do those side quests earlier, you could kind of just walk around and, you know, there's still things to kill.
[407:31.34]Still things to do.
[407:33.06]That is kind of how I'm seeing this.
[407:34.40]It's like I got booted back out to the open world.
[407:43.35]And there's still things I would like to do sometimes.
[407:49.37]Are you implying that you won at streaming?
[407:53.19]No, I'm implying that I got everything I wanted out of it.
[407:57.27]I got everything I could have ever dreamed of.
[408:01.03]In my entire life.
[408:04.03]So.
[408:06.47]I think it's time to slow it down.
[408:09.93]And stop.
[408:11.88]And would do it whenever I want.
[408:14.26]You know, I've kind of just got everything I ever really wanted out of this particular thing in my life, right?
[408:30.49]I mean, you kind of can't.
[408:32.77]Look at this the way of like.
[408:37.11]Like yeah, I could just like keep streaming every day if I wanted to.
[408:40.18]I mean, I obviously I work it off brand now, but it's not like that takes up 100% of my time.
[408:45.68]Sometimes you just kind of know like and I and I always said when I knew I would tell you and it's it's it's here.
[408:51.93]It's it's time.
[408:53.65]It's just the way it is and I'm not going to fight that.
[408:57.68]That doesn't mean I'm never going to be around.
[408:58.94]I'm just going to hang out.
[409:01.48]You know, who knows?
[409:02.06]Maybe I'll play fucking 10 million one day.
[409:11.07]You never did play Cities Skylines 2.
[409:17.41]And I think... I know that's like, oh, should you make like a statement about it?
[409:23.33]I don't know.
[409:23.97]Because I feel like making a statement is kind of making a... Like a solidified... Here is exactly... But I don't even know what happens from here.
[409:32.69]I really just don't.
[409:33.41]All I know is that I've hit that point where I'm kind of done with it as like a... Like I want to say career choice.
[409:42.55]And now it's just whenever I feel like it.
[409:46.63]He's flip-flopping around.
[409:49.81]You should absolutely see me as completely retired.
[409:52.07]Like that's just the way it is.
[409:56.33]That doesn't mean that I can't still do stuff.
[410:02.19]I know it feels like we talk about this literally every single time I go live.
[410:07.75]And I think we're not going to do that anymore.
[410:09.78]I think this is the last time you're ever going to hear about me talk about this.
[410:14.94]And going forward, you'll just see it whenever.
[410:18.56]And I will try to make sure to give like at least a few days notice.
[410:24.13]Today was very different because I just woke up in the morning and I was like, you know what?
[410:27.13]Fuck it.
[410:27.43]I'm going to drink some coffee and play 10 million.
[410:29.53]And it turns out I was here all day.
[410:32.07]That could happen.
[410:32.83]I don't know.
[410:33.21]It literally just happens right now.
[410:34.58]It happened today.
[410:38.56]But I'm happy like this.
[410:50.52]Anymore, no more big juicy Jerma?
[410:52.92]What does that even mean?
[410:57.03]Oh, I did say I was going to play mist.
[410:58.59]That's right.
[411:07.39]Yeah, go like here.
[411:08.40]It is the final thing.
[411:10.22]I'm in the open world just kind of wandering around and maybe there's a quest I want to do.
[411:15.36]And I'm giving you out here.
[411:16.78]It is the zero expectations.
[411:22.28]Anything better than zero could be one.
[411:32.85]But yeah.
[411:35.01]Thanks for watching.
[411:35.83]Thanks for hanging out.
[411:39.67]I definitely do enjoy just sort of chilling and playing a game.
[411:43.45]And I mean, I was pretty focused in the last one, but...
[412:00.49]But we'll see where it goes from here.
[412:04.74]I'll let you know if I'm going to stream.
[412:07.26]I might just jump on.
[412:10.44]I even talked to Ster and just was like, hey, you know, we were like, hey, maybe we'll just like play a fucking game and just like, who cares?
[412:19.56]Doesn't need to be crazy.
[412:20.59]Doesn't need to be, it's got to be a certain way.
[412:22.09]I have to fucking act.
[412:23.15]I got to be, look at me.
[412:24.05]It's going to be fucking great.
[412:25.15]No, fuck all that.
[412:26.03]I don't have to do any of that.
[412:27.27]Let's just fucking play something or do something.
[412:29.72]Just hang out for a little while.
[412:48.92]Oh, the subs in the Discord.
[412:50.04]Yeah, that's true.
[412:51.34]I guess I have to resubscribe to BTTV as well.
[412:58.20]Yeah, I'll be live for the DLC.
[413:02.52]You better believe it.
[413:03.40]I'll be live for the DLC.
[413:04.56]At least the launch day.
[413:06.38]I can't promise that I'm going to grind that out for like seven straight days.
[413:12.01]But I will be live at least the first day.
[413:15.07]Maybe another one.
[413:15.75]Maybe the second day.
[413:16.89]I can't.
[413:17.29]I just don't know.
[413:20.42]But I definitely do want to play it.
[413:21.74]I definitely want to play it on stream.
[413:32.71]But alright.
[413:33.49]See you guys later.
[413:34.31]Thanks for watching.
[413:36.17]Very impromptu.
[413:38.93]Credits I don't think exist.
[413:42.24]And it don't matter because like I said, you should consider this stream as in dormant retired mode.
[413:50.49]And if you do not sub to this channel, that is totally, totally fine.
[413:54.93]I would encourage you to sub somewhere else to somebody else.
[413:59.83]Judging by the frequency and the consistency that you can expect from me.
[414:14.48]Yeah.
[414:17.40]Take care of yourselves.
[414:19.30]Get up and stretch.
[414:22.56]I'll see you guys... Whenever.
[414:29.75]It's definitely not going to be six months.
[414:31.31]I think I said... I think I was fucking around last night.
[414:33.41]I was like, oh, it might be like four months from now.
[414:37.07]It's not going to be four months.
[414:40.39]But I don't know.
[414:43.41]See you at some point, probably soon.
[414:45.17]In a fairly reasonable timetable, I would say.
[414:49.98]Might just open up another fucking Steam game and just play.
[415:00.06]I'm all for it.
[415:05.93]Alright, take it easy.
[415:06.91]See you later.
[415:07.33]Call your mother.
[415:08.29]Talk to you soon.
[415:32.97]you
