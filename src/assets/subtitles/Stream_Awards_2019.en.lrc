[00:01.86]Everybody's gone crazy.
[00:04.90]They've all gone crazy.
[00:10.83]I look over at the chat.
[00:11.85]I just see.
[00:12.85]I see just like a huge wave of fire.
[00:18.01]A fucking fire.
[00:21.97]Hi, guys.
[00:22.51]Yeah, sorry.
[00:24.55]There's a lot of videos to get through.
[00:26.49]I had to load them all up.
[00:30.38]I've been doing it, uh, I've been doing it all day.
[00:32.62]I haven't left my room in fucking 16 hours.
[00:43.05]Why do I have wine on me already?
[00:45.09]This doesn't make any sense.
[00:49.21]This ain't, this ain't even a... Can you hear it?
[00:53.79]Ah, shit, you can't hear it.
[00:54.93]I have like 40 scenes set up.
[00:57.13]Alright, here we go.
[00:58.41]Happy New Year, everybody, if you've already celebrated it, if you're from, you know, forward in time rather than backwards in time like we are here in America.
[01:10.10]This is gonna be sort of like the thing we did last year.
[01:16.36]If you remember that, we chilled out for a little bit.
[01:22.05]We did the worst and best things of the year.
[01:27.59]We're doing it again.
[01:29.37]This time there are almost twice as many categories this year.
[01:34.47]Almost double the categories.
[01:36.78]Double the fun.
[01:38.50]Half the categories.
[01:40.84]Uh, half the categories are... For instance, I'm just gonna get... I'm gonna just... No spoilers, but a best auto moment... Was just... Each time my dog actually appeared on stream.
[01:54.82]And it was like five times.
[01:57.24]So, there you go.
[02:00.90]If you're new to the channel, you're probably going to be like, what kind of a sick ego fucking maniac has like a, look at how my stream awards.
[02:11.33]Well, most of these are the worst things I've done on stream this year.
[02:14.95]I'm talking worst joke, worst noise, worst impression, worst overall stream.
[02:20.66]There's also a few best ones.
[02:21.70]There are some best ones.
[02:22.82]We're not going to go all bad.
[02:26.44]Because, you know, I mean, come on.
[02:28.02]We got worst joke of the decade on here, too.
[02:30.73]And best joke of the decade.
[02:32.81]A lot of categories.
[02:36.99]Number four might surprise you.
[02:38.27]23 in total.
[02:44.82]That's a quick minus two.
[02:46.08]Yeah, it was intentional.
[02:48.18]Just a quick intentional minus two.
[02:50.08]Not a big deal.
[02:52.81]Anyways, thanks for voting.
[02:53.57]Thanks for participating.
[02:55.67]We're gonna do something first before, because I want people to trickle in.
[02:58.89]We talked about this yesterday.
[02:59.95]Let me actually make a tweet saying, hey, this fucking New Year's stream is going.
[03:05.80]New York, New York Eve.
[03:09.46]What?
[03:10.68]New Year's Eve 2019.
[03:11.42]Is it New Year's Eve 2020?
[03:12.20]Or New Year's Eve 2019?
[03:14.88]Is New Year's Eve 2020?
[03:15.52]Or is it, no, what is it, what should I write?
[03:25.14]New Year's Eve 2019.
[03:27.90]Come hang out.
[03:30.48]New Year's Eve 2019 awards.
[03:32.12]Yeah, that's better.
[03:37.40]We're gonna do the pre-show.
[03:39.36]And the pre-show is, uh, look at all the bootleg dog shit that people have made illegally of my image on Redbubble.
[03:46.88]Should be fun.
[03:52.45]There are quite a few things in here that don't make very much sense, but you know.
[03:57.05]We saw this yesterday and figured we have to do this.
[04:01.01]Give me one more second.
[04:02.43]I do apologize for being late, but you know, we got until at least the ball drops, guys.
[04:12.46]I didn't even play the right music either.
[04:16.08]Budgets were cut this year, as you can tell.
[04:18.84]I'm not in the studio.
[04:22.65]Not even close.
[04:24.63]In fact... I... Wait.
[04:32.62]I, in fact, not in the studio this year.
[04:35.34]I, in fact... What's that?
[04:40.16]What?
[04:42.23]Who's... Who is... This year, instead of being in the studio...
[04:52.83]Oh, the same fucking place I was yesterday!
[04:54.63]How are you?
[04:57.57]Good to see you.
[04:58.52]How is everybody?
[05:01.18]I should be in VR.
[05:07.02]Maybe.
[05:07.28]Okay, cheers to that.
[05:12.11]Already drinking wine, that's right.
[05:14.19]We got a bud- did I get a haircut?
[05:16.49]What do you think?
[05:20.07]What do you think?
[05:20.59]Did I get... Who's fucking calling me on New Year's Eve?
[05:24.29]Somebody's trying to FaceTime me.
[05:26.23]What time is it?
[05:28.67]Was I getting Fa- Like, New Year's, it's... What time is it?
[05:31.59]Okay, it's 7 Pacific.
[05:36.29]I was about to get a Happy New Year FaceTime.
[05:41.14]Anyways!
[05:42.22]Welcome, everybody.
[05:43.00]We're gonna start.
[05:43.72]We're gonna move on to the next... We don't need music again.
[05:46.84]It's just a fucking intro.
[05:48.93]We're going to move on to this thing that I said I wanted to do.
[05:52.85]Until people trickle in here.
[05:57.61]What do you think about the suit?
[05:59.59]I got this.
[06:00.37]You know what I got this?
[06:02.01]I got this suit.
[06:04.23]It's the same suit from last year.
[06:06.51]That's how you can tell.
[06:11.01]It's way too long and the arms are too short.
[06:13.96]I didn't even bother.
[06:14.62]Who cares?
[06:17.58]All you're seeing is from here down anyways.
[06:22.02]What's on the floor?
[06:25.40]Bunch of papers?
[06:27.88]So?
[06:29.36]What's wrong with that?
[06:31.06]So I got some papers on my floor.
[06:36.81]Who cares?
[06:39.03]Is it messy?
[06:39.65]No, it's not.
[06:44.37]Those are footprints!
[06:48.58]These are, these are, these are not, these are, these are footprints!
[06:53.92]Look!
[06:54.12]I have pants on, alright, yeah.
[06:58.46]What, this is, it's a, it's a carpet, guys.
[07:01.68]See?
[07:02.04]Look, I, I, look what I can do.
[07:06.67]Look, see?
[07:10.17]It's, it's just the way the carpet is.
[07:11.73]It's a long, fly carpet.
[07:13.07]My fly is up, right?
[07:15.25]See?
[07:15.67]It feels just like I have to be dragging my feet across the ground.
[07:20.22]You want to see what's on the paper?
[07:26.66]Fine.
[07:28.26]Blank.
[07:29.00]I dropped a package of computer paper.
[07:30.98]Look at this shit.
[07:33.13]That was a weird double-speaking for a dark mode system.
[07:36.27]Alright, this one, this one is not, well it is blank, but it has dog hair all over it.
[07:41.53]You want to see this one?
[07:42.89]Here.
[07:44.84]I dropped the dog care all over the ground.
[07:46.44]All right, I'm gonna come clean.
[07:55.12]My fucking printer is on the ground.
[08:09.41]Why is there a printer on the ground?
[08:10.71]Well, look, it's very simple.
[08:14.86]I don't have any room in my office for anything.
[08:18.28]I have this big, really nice desk right here.
[08:21.33]And that's it.
[08:21.87]There's nothing else here.
[08:24.67]So, I... I have consoles here.
[08:27.07]I have consoles here.
[08:29.21]I have monitors and shit.
[08:32.05]I thought there was no room for a printer.
[08:34.86]Get a larger desk.
[08:35.74]This is one of the biggest desks you can buy before it being a pain in the ass.
[08:40.46]This is like 72 inches long and like...
[08:43.46]like 60 inches wide.
[08:45.30]This is, all right, let's go.
[08:48.92]Let's go, we're moving on.
[08:54.16]Welcome everybody, let's go, let's check out redbubble.com.
[08:59.70]Let's just see what this looks like.
[09:00.79]Okay, so if you type in the word germa into Redbubble
[09:12.13]You get a really, really, really cool... None of this stuff is mine.
[09:18.63]We have the giant rat from Rat Movie.
[09:22.50]Is this a sticker?
[09:26.04]Leon the Lion just gave 10 community subs.
[09:27.88]Thank you, Leon the Lion.
[09:33.30]Alright, so these two are exactly the same.
[09:37.22]The only difference is this one's low-res.
[09:41.15]Are these sticker?
[09:44.71]I don't get it.
[09:45.97]$16.15.
[09:45.99]Here's Fireman.
[09:47.94]This actually may be more expensive than just buying it from the actual Jackbox link.
[09:54.22]It is.
[09:55.74]Isn't it like $20?
[09:56.72]Is it cheaper?
[09:59.88]What was that?
[10:01.99]Otto!
[10:03.71]Hold on.
[10:05.19]Otto is like, hold on.
[10:06.57]Did you hear that?
[10:07.09]He's like, hey!
[10:08.13]Hold on.
[10:08.53]Wait.
[10:08.71]Give me one sec.
[10:34.79]Yeah, he wanted to come in the room.
[10:36.17]He was like, let me in.
[10:36.91]All right, so we also have T-Posing German, a 95 classic t-shirt.
[10:42.38]I don't know what that means, classic.
[10:45.16]A fireman sticker.
[10:46.00]This is $2.50.
[10:48.00]Show, Otto?
[10:51.90]He just wants to lie on his little bed.
[10:53.26]All right, here.
[11:00.03]How do I...
[11:04.68]There you go.
[11:05.20]There he is.
[11:07.71]Hi, Otto.
[11:11.27]Dude, POG.
[11:12.05]Otto.
[11:12.35]Alright, let's go back to this.
[11:17.29]T-Posing, 17 bucks.
[11:18.85]Fire Maid sticker, okay.
[11:20.59]This is where it gets interesting, though.
[11:21.67]So we have Germ of Fear, sticker 250.
[11:23.26]This is the Life is Pain shirt by Boomer USA.
[11:32.90]Miserable Mikey...
[11:37.25]I need to click this one because it's... I don't understand what this one is.
[11:41.18]So this is a German 985 official mug.
[11:45.00]Okay.
[11:48.36]You gotta be kidding me.
[11:55.13]There's an emote sized... That's it?
[12:03.21]This is just a white mug.
[12:05.11]We saw this yesterday.
[12:06.21]I can't fucking believe it.
[12:08.93]This is $15.76.
[12:15.47]You could go get 50 of these from Target.
[12:20.86]The exact same mug for probably 30 or 40 bucks.
[12:25.18]And just put a sticker on it.
[12:28.17]That's unbelievable.
[12:30.15]Pretty good, uh, pretty good, uh, Jerma985 branded merchandise.
[12:32.97]Hey, this is Coffee Cheetos chicken shirt.
[12:36.82]What is this?
[12:38.78]The Jerma rainbow?
[12:44.36]This has, doesn't have anything to do with me.
[12:51.15]What does this have to do with me?
[12:53.55]It's just like a weird knitted pattern.
[12:58.76]Oh, it's my face!
[13:01.14]That's my face!
[13:02.24]How do I... We gotta zoom in.
[13:09.67]How is zooming in zooming out?
[13:13.92]Hold on.
[13:15.50]Let's enhance this.
[13:27.57]You can barely even see it.
[13:28.79]It's my face, though.
[13:30.83]It's little, tiny, little faces.
[13:39.61]I'm not going to buy this.
[13:40.83]Why would I buy this?
[13:42.85]What, I'm just gonna encourage image theft?
[13:48.01]This is my face!
[13:52.71]Why would I buy the product that's taking my likeness and selling it?
[13:58.86]Why would I do that?
[14:09.32]I do like this, uh, like the default, uh, guy that's just here though.
[14:13.62]It's pretty funny.
[14:14.22]All right, let's keep going.
[14:17.62]They're apparently like 60 of these.
[14:18.58]There's a, there's a life is pain right here.
[14:23.41]Pretty standard.
[14:24.85]$22.
[14:25.57]German95, blue germ case.
[14:27.89]That's alright.
[14:28.97]Get that ad out of here, please.
[14:32.29]11-hour Seaman lockdown long-sleeve t-shirt.
[14:43.14]I survived the 11-hour Seaman lockdown.
[14:46.34]I watched Germa stream Seaman for 11 hours, 9 minutes, and 58 seconds.
[15:01.08]Alright, I'll let this one slide.
[15:03.32]I'll let that one slide.
[15:05.22]You know, that's... I'll let that one slide.
[15:10.14]Sweet genius, not even my content.
[15:12.55]Star.
[15:15.99]German logo, tri-blend t-shirt.
[15:17.87]Okay.
[15:18.55]With the rat's long sleeve.
[15:22.43]What?
[15:22.91]It's just Jerma985, Jerma985, have a nice day.
[15:27.86]Have a nice day.
[15:28.58]Don't be an accessory to make the hundred billion plastic bags in the U. Wait, wait, what is this?
[15:38.49]Wait, why is there a plastic bag warning?
[15:42.53]This is, hold on.
[15:46.65]Look at this.
[15:48.87]Did a bot just rip this somehow and put this on here?
[15:54.48]Why would the bot algorithm do all this?
[16:00.49]German 985, German 985, and it has nothing to do with rats.
[16:03.99]Have a nice day.
[16:05.99]Warning, to avoid danger of suffocation, keep this plastic bag away from babies and children.
[16:10.58]Do not use this bag in cribs, beds, carriages, or play pens.
[16:14.44]The plastic bag could block nose and mouth and prevent breathing.
[16:17.62]In fact, this plastic bag is so destructive to the environment that if you really care about the future, you could seriously just reuse paper bags from here on out.
[16:25.51]This bag is not a toy.
[16:28.54]Don't be an accessory to make the 100 billion plastic bags in the US each year.
[16:32.09]It makes it 12 billion barrels of oil.
[16:39.07]I mean, that's not a bad message, right?
[16:45.05]But what do I have to do with plastic bag?
[16:52.03]Are they implying that I use them all the time?
[16:55.12]Why am I on here?
[17:02.16]Whatever.
[17:03.03]Let's keep going.
[17:06.75]And they say this is a plastic bag.
[17:08.39]This is not a plastic bag.
[17:13.05]The Spies.
[17:14.25]That's a classic.
[17:14.93]Okay, Spies.
[17:17.73]The German 985 duvet cover.
[17:22.81]Interesting.
[17:26.42]This is 86 bucks for a twin.
[17:31.47]All right, well, what does a king look like?
[17:43.22]$131.
[17:46.33]I feel like this is a scam, though.
[17:48.03]Are you even going to get it?
[17:52.59]But what if you don't get it?
[17:53.99]Are you even going to get this?
[17:55.65]Or is it just a bot?
[17:59.88]I'm so confused.
[18:02.10]Read the reviews.
[18:02.68]All the reviews are copy-pasted.
[18:04.22]Remember we looked at this?
[18:06.20]Love the new duvet cover.
[18:07.32]Love the new duvet cover, but it did not come with matching pillowcases.
[18:10.57]Probably in the fine print, but I was a little disappointed because the duvet cover was so cool.
[18:16.05]Extremely nice high quality.
[18:17.37]High quality with beautiful graphics.
[18:21.59]I don't know what this is.
[18:23.25]This product was just what?
[18:24.65]This product was just what I hoped.
[18:26.25]My daughter absolutely loves it.
[18:29.05]You see this same shit on iOS.
[18:32.60]We've gotten to a point on the internet where nothing is real.
[18:38.90]If you go to a review site and fucking 5,000 comments, 5,000 reviews are on a product, maybe 25 of those are real.
[18:50.80]How can you even tell?
[18:51.40]There's no way.
[18:53.40]I mean, you can tell because... But what if these are real people?
[18:59.37]These might be real people.
[19:03.33]I don't know.
[19:08.75]Well, I'm not buying it.
[19:11.03]A German slim fit t-shirt.
[19:12.52]It's just the... I'm not small, I'm compact.
[19:16.42]Acrylic block.
[19:27.81]I mean, this is... Anybody could say that.
[19:32.94]I'm not small.
[19:33.72]I'm compact.
[19:34.42]It's one of those glass things that you... Look at that font.
[19:39.66]Yeah, what's with the Old West font?
[19:42.75]That doesn't make any sense.
[19:46.27]By the way, I didn't even get the quote right.
[19:49.67]So this is truly bootleg.
[19:51.59]It's, I'm not tiny.
[19:52.51]I'm compact.
[19:56.05]Didn't even get the quote right.
[19:59.69]I mean, come on.
[20:00.15]You've got to get the quote right.
[20:03.48]Jerma... This is mature content.
[20:06.88]Jerma the dick?
[20:08.02]What?
[20:09.28]I don't know what that is.
[20:10.02]I'm not clicking that one.
[20:11.54]I'm not clicking on the dick one.
[20:15.70]Why is there Jerma a dick something?
[20:18.80]I'm not clicking that.
[20:20.90]Wait.
[20:21.84]Okay, I'll click it.
[20:25.16]Display mature content.
[20:31.32]What?
[20:34.37]I don't understand.
[20:37.17]I don't get it.
[20:37.57]I don't, I don't, I don't get it, but I'm, this is, it's, okay, it's an iPhone cover?
[20:46.42]No, it's a Samsung Galaxy case.
[20:50.30]There's like a weird camera pointing at, show it?
[20:53.77]I feel like I'm scared to show this.
[20:55.17]I don't know if this is, I don't know what this is.
[20:59.37]The, the dick, and there's a camera.
[21:01.39]I don't get it.
[21:02.31]Why is this not, why is this not safe for work?
[21:10.56]Look at the edges.
[21:17.02]It's just the dick, and it's a Samsung Galaxy cover.
[21:23.78]It's just, it's really, yeah, it's very crusty.
[21:27.43]Well, okay.
[21:29.05]Cool.
[21:30.27]There's a star case, it looks pretty cool.
[21:31.95]Although, I think, doesn't even, doesn't he have one of those already?
[21:35.67]Coffee Cheetos and chicken t-shirt.
[21:38.87]I don't know what this is.
[21:41.21]This is, I think this is TF2 logo.
[21:44.44]Jeremy T posing slim fit t-shirt.
[21:51.26]Ding wall tapestry.
[21:55.48]Ding wall tap, ding.
[21:57.06]Oh, it's supposed to be my teeth?
[22:05.29]Look at how stupid this fucking looks.
[22:10.73]This... You dressing up this whole room with all this cool artsy stuff?

[39:23.11]Everyone says Shido sucks.
[39:24.69]What do you mean Shido sucks?
[39:30.56]What's wrong with what you're talking about?
[39:33.22]30% of you.

[39:56.00]Yeah, I mean, there's 8,000 people here.
[39:58.68]Best Otto moment, that could be like, that could be like somebody that lives down the street.

[40:14.52]Alright, the nominees for Best Otto Moment are... One, four... Okay, the twos are done.
[40:32.41]So these are both fours.
[40:33.77]So this has to be like this.
[40:35.16]What the fuck is that?
[40:42.08]Why is this playing?
[40:46.01]Why is this playing?
[40:54.21]Is this supposed to be distraction?
[41:04.13]Did I do that right?
[41:05.09]I love how this is playing the whole video.
[41:07.54]That's it.
[41:10.48]That's it.
[41:11.60]It's just doing the video.

[42:20.40]Put him to bed.
[42:20.96]He belongs in bed.
[42:22.90]That's not a paid actor.
[42:24.50]That's my girlfriend.
[42:25.37]He's just like... That dog.
[42:34.79]Dogs are like babies.
[42:35.75]You know what I mean?
[42:37.13]She's like... That was Kim.
[42:46.72]See?

[42:56.79]He's eight years old.
[42:57.81]He's fantastic.
[42:58.51]I love him.
[43:05.20]Hey, Adel.
[43:07.00]Hello, Adel.
[43:07.64]That's just a clip right behind me.
[43:09.12]This category sucks.
[43:13.73]I was bullied into putting this in.
[43:15.99]I was bullied into putting this in.
[43:18.18]Yes, it's me.
[43:20.58]Otto.
[43:20.96]He's like, what are you doing?
[43:26.14]Who's my good dog?
[43:26.90]There you go.
[43:31.93]Otto spotted.
[43:32.67]This is just what he does, guys.
[43:35.63]Hey.
[43:49.38]Hey.
[43:51.76]Hey, what are you doing?
[43:53.18]This is sad.
[43:54.28]This is a sad song.
[43:55.09]Were you napping in here?
[43:56.05]No, it's not.
[44:00.39]Hey, thanks for the subs, by the way.
[44:03.49]Hey, what are you doing?
[44:07.58]Glucosamine and chondroitin.
[44:10.36]Oh, what does that do?
[44:11.66]Where do I get it?
[44:21.01]Yes, if you... When your dog only shows up four times on stream, you have to reach for something else to put in the category list.
[44:31.73]It was the flash in the corner and... That was Otto.
[44:37.88]And the winner for best Otto moment of 2019 is going to go to... Who Cares?
[44:49.60]Picross interruption, Otto.
[44:51.64]Picross, 27% of the vote.
[44:53.24]What do you mean rude?
[45:00.66]What?
[45:01.18]I love this dog.
[45:03.97]But all those clips were the same clip.
[45:07.11]Besides, it was all the same video.
[45:11.89]Otto, would you like to say something, Otto?
[45:21.46]Zoom in on that and put it on the list for next year.
[45:26.28]We saw the tail wag, yeah.
[45:28.65]All right, coming up next is... I don't think I... Do I need to introduce this one?
[45:41.80]Are you sure you want me to introduce... It's... Ladies and gentlemen, the nominees for worst speeder of the year.
[45:58.52]Parker, Griffin, and Dinklage, all famous faces sharing this common name.
[46:03.68]Dr. Schmoidson?
[46:05.92]Yes, I believe that is... Beater.
[46:10.68]Who's Beater?
[46:12.35]Who?
[46:12.87]What is Beater?
[46:14.83]Why is he not talking?
[46:18.67]I mean, I am.
[46:19.49]I'm just trying to focus.
[46:23.01]I think it's 500 beaters in seven and a half minutes, six and a half minutes.
[46:36.06]Still not big enough to get these.
[46:49.28]It's a goddamn maze baiter.
[46:52.59]It's a maze baiter.
[47:00.61]Okay, that was kind of funny.
[47:03.37]Not really.
[47:07.19]I think I got it.
[47:11.63]No.
[47:11.79]But we're in the endgame here.
[47:16.62]Why do you leave a voicemail on a public phone?
[47:19.44]Later.
[47:39.59]and the winner of this year's worst feeder of the year what do you think what do you think what was the worst uh what was the worst one I told you we're getting this shitty oh okay auto was a fine category best actually auto was the only one that didn't make sense what do you think
[48:06.06]Dr. Schmoyk's and Peter for 32% of the vote.
[48:10.18]By a lot, actually.
[48:12.82]What was in second place?
[48:13.62]Let me see.
[48:16.66]The Schmoyk's and Peter was apparently the worst one, but I don't know if I agree with that.
[48:21.16]I think I disagree with that one.
[48:22.84]The Academy, I think, got that one wrong.
[48:26.24]What came in second place?
[48:27.64]Because that was 32%.
[48:28.20]Where's Peter?
[48:28.84]Where is it?
[48:36.05]No, it was close.
[48:36.85]It was pretty close.
[48:40.33]So, voicemail Peter was the next one.
[48:43.77]Which was at 23% of the vote.
[48:47.06]So, not a huge spread.
[48:50.84]By the way, this category will not return next year.
[48:53.28]I promise.
[48:54.10]I know I said that last year.
[48:56.82]I promise this will not return next year.
[48:59.28]Please clip this and save it somewhere because don't let me do this again.
[49:03.77]In fact...
[49:08.41]Now that means I can't ever do it again.
[49:13.15]This next category... Lying.
[49:17.76]Why is that a lie?
[49:19.68]Not quite.
[49:19.98]Not yet.
[49:20.46]Not a lie yet.
[49:23.62]Anyways, moving on to... Hold on, let me burp internally.
[49:29.06]This next category is... Actually, the next two categories in a row have to do with my physical appearance.
[49:37.88]We're coming up with next worst hair of 2019.
[49:40.16]Worst hair.
[49:46.08]I like having long hair.
[49:48.08]I like having it shaped and be able to lay it back behind my ears.
[49:52.58]I like having hair like this.
[49:54.84]Maybe not this long in particular, but... Sometimes, especially when it gets hot in here, if I'm doing something, or if things get a little... I've been streaming for six, seven, plus eight hours in a row, and I don't get up and go to the bathroom, I sit back down.
[50:08.64]Sometimes it gets a little messed up, and there's not much you can do about that.
[50:13.17]And these are the times that people said it was the worst it's ever looked on stream.
[50:20.00]I could throw water in my face and in my hair, but then it gets all wet and stringy.
[50:23.70]I don't like it.
[50:24.34]So here you are.
[50:26.10]Here are your nominees for worst hair of 2019.
[50:31.72]Doesn't need that much more of an introduction.
[51:02.17]Why do you have braided hair?
[51:13.77]I'm leaving it.
[51:14.29]I ain't gonna fix it.
[51:16.44]Fuck that.
[51:18.06]I'm so fucking drunk.
[51:20.06]God.
[51:22.56]It just happened.
[51:23.80]I don't know how.
[51:25.38]I have no idea.
[51:30.84]I don't know why that happened.
[51:31.94]This is the drunkest I've been on stream.
[51:33.98]This looks... I don't even care.
[51:36.08]You know how sometimes you give a shit about your appearance?
[51:38.70]When the webcam goes on, right?
[51:42.19]And I know the webcam's on.
[51:43.73]Usually, I'm a little self-conscious.
[51:45.35]I want to make sure that I look okay.
[51:47.55]How's my face look?
[51:48.81]Do I look alright?
[51:49.53]Do I look okay?
[51:51.39]I don't care right now.
[51:52.47]You can just tell.
[51:54.15]These images are going to come back to haunt me in two years.
[51:59.22]Or one.
[52:00.44]Like, I don't even care.
[52:01.58]Like, I just don't... Typically I'd be like, oh, hold on, before I turn the camera on, let me like... Okay.
[52:09.93]I know my hair is looking fucked up, it's because I was in the wind.
[52:13.48]I know my hair looks like fucking al dente spaghetti today.
[52:16.78]And that's because I was out in the wind.
[52:19.32]I was in the wind.
[52:20.98]Sire.
[52:23.22]You have so many dropped frames and my family needs to use the internet and go to Amazon and buy cases of ocean spray juice.
[52:30.65]Can I nominate this for worst zip of 2019?
[52:32.63]Because that's, and small, small figurines of venom.
[52:37.33]We need to.
[52:38.57]And then he looks over.
[52:41.12]And he finally makes a decision, right?
[52:45.71]Is someone with my camera?
[52:49.95]Hey, thanks.
[52:51.67]Thanks, LockCokeGaming.
[52:57.09]The room is in my room.
[52:59.05]Not on this video.
[53:02.77]So what do you guys want to do?
[53:09.31]I can barely do anything.
[53:11.03]I really don't want to lie to you guys.
[53:18.22]Hey, how's everybody doing?
[53:19.60]How are you?
[53:20.58]Yeah, it's been rough, but it's all right.
[53:22.16]I'm doing all right.
[53:22.72]I'm doing good.
[53:24.24]How are you doing?
[53:24.86]How's everything going?
[53:25.54]How are the kids?
[53:28.22]Yeah, you know, I'm like the guy that screams at people under the bridge now.
[53:30.96]You know, that's what I do.
[53:32.56]It's been really, you know, it gets the job done.
[53:36.08]Ow.
[53:41.37]A lot of, uh... A lot of good nominees there.
[53:48.87]a lot of good nominees but there can only be one winner unfortunately there can only be one and the winner for the worst here in 2019 is going to go to this won by a lot with 35 of the vote
[54:18.81]Freud on red wine hair.
[54:22.13]With 35% of the vote.
[54:25.19]Guy under the bridge came in with about 27%.
[54:26.69]Worst hair of the year.
[54:40.90]If I were to pick that one, if it were going to be me, the VR train wreck hair was disgusting.
[54:49.18]That's not only the worst hair I've ever had in 2019.
[54:52.12]And that didn't even... I mean, it was up there.
[54:55.92]The VR train wreck hair came in third place.
[54:58.57]With 19% of the vote.
[55:00.83]But... My God.
[55:04.67]It was ridiculous.
[55:06.23]It looked like it was made... It looked like it was dirty.
[55:09.25]It was dirty and greasy and looked like somebody put a bunch of hair gel in it and squished it together and held it tight and then fucking let it go after like an hour.
[55:16.35]Oh, it was horrible.
[55:21.38]We got another category to do.
[55:30.04]This is Worst Face.
[55:37.49]Worst Face.
[55:39.19]Why did we do Worst here last year?
[55:40.87]Didn't do Worst Face last year.
[55:42.09]This is a new category this year.
[55:44.42]And it's Worst Face.
[55:46.52]This is the worst face I've ever made on stream in 2019, whether it's being shocked or trying to do something funny that doesn't come across as funny, just ugly and strange.
[55:56.47]These are the nominees for Worst Face of 2019.
[56:28.46]No, no, no!
[56:30.40]I look like a- I look like a dream person!
[56:41.18]You are like wicked fucked up right now, look at this!
[56:48.17]What's wrong with my face?! !
[57:17.99]Now feel free to try a different look.
[58:02.65]Bomb, I hope you're proud of me.
[58:03.89]I hope you're proud, Bomb.
[58:07.61]The worst face of 2019.
[58:17.15]the big lipstick with 36 of the vote it kind of destroyed yeah it really wasn't close after big lipstick farting and screaming playlist
[58:38.11]was in second place at 13 percent and then the greedy grinner at 13.08 percent which farting scream was 13.2 everything was very close recent bias maybe maybe but it is written down there very sloppily because you can tell the stream was late today right we started we started about 40 minutes late and there's a few reasons for that uh reasons are for what you're about to see I had to get these written down and I'm just like mid lipstick
[59:11.41]Because I got these, I told you, from Amazon.
[59:14.89]And I'm going, do I just fucking, do I just like, do I go to a store right now and get some more of these?
[59:19.11]Do I go to a store?
[59:21.09]And I freaked out and I was like, Scott, whatever, it doesn't matter.
[59:26.70]I was like about to get in the car and about to go, no, whatever, I don't care, just put them on the little ones.
[59:31.30]He's a professional streamer, by the way.
[59:33.68]No, I told you, they were budget cuts this year.
[59:35.68]Last year we were in a studio and I had all like that, a big lath of trophies.
[59:39.26]We had to cut a few corners this year.
[59:43.76]What are you doing?
[59:48.84]What are you doing?
[59:49.44]What is this?
[59:49.76]Why is it spamming this?
[59:50.80]What is this?
[59:51.16]This is spamming so fast, I can't even... Alright.
[60:01.10]It's not January 1st, by the way.
[60:03.12]So... This, uh... You can't... You can't nominate this.
[60:24.69]I'm such a fucking cartoon character.
[60:47.07]I can't even replicate that.
[60:52.11]That's Apex Twin.
[60:55.03]Wait, did we say who it was?
[60:56.55]Yeah, it was the big lipstick.
[60:57.51]Of course it was.
[60:59.16]Moving along.
[60:59.80]Now we're moving into categories that potentially have a lot of nominees.
[61:06.61]Last year, this was an incredibly last-second thing, besides being in the studio.
[61:11.13]This was an insanely last-second thing last year.
[61:13.78]And really try to get as many good, high-quality categories as possible first, right?
[61:20.66]This year... And people only had like two or three days to nominate stuff, and it was bang, bang, bang.
[61:26.01]It was really quick last year.
[61:27.73]But this year, people had about a week and a half or so to figure out what they wanted to nominate.
[61:32.67]And...
[61:34.23]There were a lot of nominees in some of these.
[61:36.93]Worst Noise had like 25 nominees.
[61:40.21]We had to shave some off.
[61:42.97]It's a lot of nominees in some of these categories.
[61:45.29]And we're going to show, I think this one's doesn't, not quite yet.
[61:49.33]But moving on to Worst Singing of the Year.
[61:51.05]This is a new category.
[61:53.56]By the way, both of these categories are the same category.
[62:00.13]The nominees in this category are no better than the nominees in this category.
[62:06.57]I could switch these in my hands right now and you would not know the difference.
[62:11.27]So we'll go ahead and start with worst singing of the year.
[62:20.06]Let's see what the nominees are.
[62:39.28]And this is the one that goes, rolling around at the speed of sound.
[62:43.60]Right?
[62:43.94]Something like that.
[62:47.11]I got a feeling.
[62:48.09]Sing him a song.
[62:49.75]Holy fuck, that was horrible.
[63:11.75]O Canada, our home and sacred land, True patriot side, and all thy sons command.
[63:28.40]With... Street rat, street rat, I am not a street rat.
[63:35.94]They're there, you, they're there.
[63:39.67]Gotta go to sleep, gotta have some sheep, gotta have some fun while I have time.
[64:03.82]I love the music in the background of the music.
[64:26.76]Worst singing of the year, apparently.
[64:28.08]Oh, this one wasn't even a fucking contest.
[64:33.12]Not even close.
[64:34.76]Not even close.
[64:37.88]This is ridiculous how unbelievable this was skewed.
[64:44.30]The winner of worst singing of 2019 with 50% of the vote.
[64:46.52]And you have to remember...
[64:52.96]There were one, two, three, four, five, six, seven nominees in this category.
[64:57.62]The category, the nominee after that had 13%.
[65:00.98]And it was E. He never going to give you up.
[65:06.93]Uh,
[65:16.70]Also, by the way, this is the first win of I Got a Feeling singing stream and second nomination of the night for worst stream of the year upcoming.
[65:26.72]That's on here a few times.
[65:29.37]That stream is on here more than once.
[65:34.31]Also nominated for worst stream of the whole year.
[65:47.69]okay uh now let's best singing is now this is best singing by the way you'll see what I'm talking about when I say they both give the same damn category I should have just had a singing category where like two people won here are the categories and the nominees for best singing of the year
[66:15.75]Everyone's gonna start fucking counting.
[66:19.67]And I can't stop this shit because it's in the game.
[66:24.74]Wish I could do something like that.
[66:34.63]Spanning a meme from like 2015.
[66:36.29]Still happening.
[66:43.12]I will never stop it!
[66:48.26]You... You got a friend in me.
[66:53.70]You got a friend in me!
[66:55.84]But before I throw it in... Say you're seeing your own friend inside of yourself.
[67:05.57]But you got a friend in me.
[67:08.37]This is fucking terrible.
[67:10.29]You...
[67:11.87]I don't know.
[67:12.67]I have no idea how this works.
[67:14.65]I told you.
[67:15.63]I told you.
[67:16.44]In the water.
[67:21.04]I'm so fucking angry right now.
[67:38.94]I can't even tell who's talking.
[67:40.62]I'm going to lose again.
[67:41.96]I was singing.
[67:43.04]You can't hear.
[67:43.52]This is all fucking cursed.
[67:44.90]What did you do?
[67:46.32]Why is it like this?
[67:48.82]Let's hear it.
[67:49.60]Come on.
[67:50.47]F-G-H-I.
[67:51.15]Come on.
[67:52.21]Come on.
[67:53.27]All of you now.
[68:02.17]So of the 1,400 people that unfollowed tonight, I hope to see you soon.
[68:10.23]Hope to see you back.
[68:37.70]You are, you are, you, you are, you are, you are, you are the dancing, dancing, dancing queen.
[68:56.03]Seventeen, only seventeen.
[69:03.62]You can dance, you can laugh, having the time of your life.
[69:28.35]You know when shit plays back to you, and you know you've seen it, you've heard it before, and you're looking at what you've done over the last year, and you just kind of go... Now I understand why people think I do drugs on stream.
[69:43.22]You know what I mean?
[69:44.30]I get what you mean now, when you say, like, oh, hey, does this dude, like, do fucking drugs?
[69:50.85]It's kind of hard to defend against these nominees.
[69:55.21]Anyways...
[69:56.44]The winner of best singing, you already know what it is.
[69:58.84]Do I even need to do the fanfare?
[70:00.29]Do I even need to tell you?
[70:02.73]If it was on the list, it was going to win.
[70:04.37]You know that.
[70:12.81]QRS from the Mindshow stream.
[70:15.76]30% of the vote.
[70:18.90]This was not as far away as you thought it was.
[70:21.14]30% voted for QRS.
[70:26.99]Green Day was after that.
[70:29.99]Somehow singing a Katamari song was in third place with 16% of the vote.
[70:36.29]It was me going like this.
[70:37.94]I know people are going to fucking freak out.
[70:40.26]People are going to be really upset with me.
[70:41.76]And they're going to tell me to stop.
[70:43.18]But I need to show you what people are going to say.
[70:45.00]Don't fucking do that.
[70:47.08]Stop doing that.
[70:47.82]But you just need to hear it.
[70:54.30]That's what I was doing.
[70:55.58]I didn't do it for long.
[70:56.90]I didn't do it for very long.
[70:57.80]Calm down.
[70:59.02]That's what I was doing.
[70:59.70]I was humming that to the beat.
[71:00.98]Apparently, 16% of you thought that was the best singing I've done all year.
[71:04.76]That's just what I'm not going to go.
[71:05.88]I'm not doing it anymore.
[71:10.10]Those are new categories, by the way.
[71:11.29]This next category is one of my favorites.
[71:16.81]Best one guy moment of the year.
[71:19.89]Best one guy.
[71:20.75]What is one guy moment?
[71:21.81]For those of you that might be new to the channel.
[71:24.52]One guy is, especially a one guy moment, is when one person in the stream, in the chat, can either throw off the entire stream or can dictate the conversation exactly where it goes.
[71:38.21]I'll look over, I will read something that somebody says, and it will change the course of the entire history of the channel.
[71:46.63]So...
[71:48.17]If you stay on this stream, there's a possibility that you will one day be the one guy that I will look over and say, hey, dude, like eat a ghost pepper on stream.
[71:56.11]And I'll go, all right, fucking cool, dude.
[71:57.61]Sure.
[71:59.35]I mean, I'm not going to do that, but I can at least pretend to, right?
[72:02.62]Best one, here are the nominees for best one guy moment of the year.
[72:06.32]A couple of these chicks shouldn't even fucking be on here, but they made me laugh for a second.
[72:10.66]So they're on here.
[72:12.96]Oh, okay.
[72:13.82]Here we go.
[72:15.29]Nominees for Best One Guy Moment of the Year are as follows.

[76:46.35]What the... That's...
[76:50.37]Is this a fake account?
[76:52.19]No, it's not.
[76:52.65]This has three and a half million followers.
[76:55.52]This can't be a fake account.
[76:57.42]Is this a fake account?
[77:02.60]No, holy shit.
[77:09.32]And the award for best tweet of 2019 goes to... Oh my god, that's kind of fucking crazy.
[77:23.51]Uh, that's pretty cool.
[77:27.01]Is it fake?
[77:28.27]It's not.
[77:28.51]Is it fake?
[77:29.13]Did I get faked out?
[77:33.17]I'm so confused right now of what's happening.
[77:35.14]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[77:37.06]Hey.
[77:42.60]You know, I'm available.
[77:44.98]Just saying, I'm available.
[77:47.08]I'm always available.
[77:49.58]I got nothing going on.
[77:53.94]Besides just sweating in my shirt.
[77:58.86]For what?
[77:59.30]I'm kidding.
[78:01.05]I'm kidding.
[78:07.17]The next category.
[78:10.45]People say the music's a little too loud.
[78:11.95]I'm sorry about that.
[78:13.55]The music is baked into every video.
[78:16.58]There were like 30 editors making these.
[78:18.62]So we tried to get it done as quick as we could.
[78:23.38]Can't fix it.
[78:24.90]Sorry.
[78:25.18]Yep, we are.
[78:26.24]Just fucking go like this.
[78:30.86]Okay.
[78:32.41]Worst vroom of the year, if you don't know what a vroom is.
[78:36.27]A vroom is when I live in a place... By the way, I live in Las Vegas, if you don't know.
[78:43.39]I live in Las Vegas, and I live in a spot where people like to either mod the fuck out of their cars or blow by the street that I live on.
[78:54.79]It's really really irritating and it ruins stream.
[78:57.27]Sometimes it gets in the way One actually happened about 30 or 40 minutes ago.
[79:01.71]So it happened already on this stream it Might lose concentration.
[79:07.32]It's really fucking annoying.
[79:08.96]So these are the worst times that they happened on stream this year and I'm not even sure how accurate these nominees are because
[79:19.43]There's been so many of these that I think people forget just how fucking loud and obnoxious they are.
[79:25.79]There are some real good ones on here.
[79:28.92]Really good ones.
[79:33.34]What are you drinking?
[79:41.81]He's got the same hair too.
[79:43.55]He's got the same mustache hair.
[79:46.65]This could have been meat.
[79:49.46]You know what's that joke like?
[79:50.84]Hey, I'm going to tell my kids that this was that part.
[79:54.54]Just tell your kids that I was the mask.
[80:00.04]Because look, look at this.
[80:02.82]It really could be that.
[80:12.05]That's just me with makeup on.
[80:14.25]That is, it's just me.
[80:15.13]That's me with makeup on.
[80:23.28]My nose is too pointy and big.
[80:28.66]Fucking ban that guy.
[80:30.50]All right, let's move on.
[80:32.01]This is Worst Room of the Year coming up.
[80:35.53]I can't fucking... This is crazy.
[80:38.45]This is crazy to me.
[80:39.51]All right.
[80:40.31]Worst Room of the Year.
[80:40.95]Here are the nominees.
[80:55.71]Well, get there!
[80:56.25]Let's go!
[80:56.67]Gee!
[80:58.91]Take me to the Barry Center!
[80:59.99]What the hell's going on here?
[81:00.89]There we go.
[81:03.25]Does it say if there's life on it?
[81:13.00]Alright, there's life on this planet.
[81:18.66]Or, life on this one.
[81:24.43]Where's my little seismograph meter?
[81:27.42]Don't I have one of those?
[81:29.30]Look up.
[81:35.82]Are those motorcycles in my room?
[81:43.18]I'm in VR, I can't tell.
[81:47.88]Pistol.
[81:50.02]Shotgun.
[81:52.96]Shotgun.
[81:53.22]I don't like the shotgun.
[81:58.91]Pretty good timing.
[81:59.65]Pretty good time.
[82:01.15]It was 1 minute and 12 seconds first lap.
[82:04.07]See you again in a minute and 15 seconds.
[82:06.05]I'm gonna give him the shotgun.
[82:11.92]When I get the money...
[82:15.26]I felt like somebody was just going to just drive into the house.
[82:19.30]Like, I really felt like somebody was going into the window.
[82:21.34]Like, I thought that was somebody in a little drone flying and crashing into my window.
[82:25.56]That just scared the shit out of me.
[82:29.53]That was in the house, yeah.
[82:33.15]That sounded fake.
[82:34.59]If somebody's in a pod racer out here.
[82:36.61]That was a Star Wars fucking pod racer.
[82:40.45]That wasn't even a car.
[82:42.72]You give her a little thing like, oh, say goodbye.
[82:45.02]You don't just like... Flush!
[82:55.33]Woof!
[82:57.27]Keep her in a box.
[83:08.40]You really can't do that.
[83:09.32]Gabi will start to smell up the drawer.
[83:11.21]I'm glad I cannot fall down this unless I really fuck this part up right here.
[83:14.83]All right.
[83:19.97]That fucking guy driving the car.
[83:22.97]The guy in the fucking car that just sped by at a thousand miles per hour.
[83:28.73]It's just screamed in my ear.
[83:36.01]What the fuck, man?
[83:37.27]Look.
[83:40.23]That's so annoying.
[83:41.45]That's so annoying.
[83:44.77]Whatever.
[83:45.11]That's two.
[83:46.54]Give me a break, though.
[83:48.20]Seriously, I get to be mad at that.
[83:52.74]I get to be upset about that.
[83:53.92]That's so annoying.
[83:55.04]And somebody just screaming outside your window as loud as they can.
[83:58.86]Like somebody just threw a glass bottle at my house while I took that jump.
[84:04.68]I'll get back up there.
[84:14.34]Alright, you can hear- that one was real.
[84:17.52]Yeah, I know you hear the fake one right now, but that one was real.
[84:22.64]That was not a, uh... Uh, yeah, it happens all the time.
[84:39.89]It's such a pain in the ass.
[84:43.75]And it really is starting to become a pretty major problem.
[84:48.47]It really is.
[84:51.55]What would you guys say?
[84:54.49]I would say probably two or three times a stream, right?
[84:57.93]It has to be.
[84:59.19]It has to be at least two or three times a stream.
[85:04.25]Soundproof your house.
[85:05.23]Okay.
[85:09.17]Worst room of the year.
[85:10.19]This was very close.
[85:12.51]Barrett is the closest one all night, by the way.
[85:14.19]At 24.9% of the vote.
[85:14.59]Right on time.
[85:34.45]Distraction Jump King Podracer.
[85:37.31]No, that's not correct.
[85:38.98]I blew it.
[85:39.78]Distraction Jump King Podracer was right below it.
[85:45.62]Distraction Jump King was at 24%.
[85:47.98]Podracer was at 22.5%.
[85:48.94]There you go.
[85:54.85]That was very, very close.
[85:55.91]Closest one all night.
[85:58.83]It was La La Land.
[86:04.88]I'm not looking forward to these categories coming up.
[86:07.49]Because now we're getting into embarrassing territory.
[86:11.29]Like we haven't already.
[86:12.41]Apparently we haven't already.
[86:15.73]I like to do impressions.
[86:17.21]Off the cuff.
[86:18.57]Sometimes they're good, sometimes they're bad.
[86:21.15]Most of the times they're bad.
[86:23.09]Yeah, the hair was pretty embarrassing, you're right.
[86:25.21]Most of the time they're very bad.
[86:28.89]This is another one of those categories where there's two of them, for some reason.
[86:33.58]Worst impression and best impression.
[86:38.48]Another interchangeable list.
[86:40.51]And some of these nominees don't... Did you... No, you didn't.
[86:43.55]Okay, yeah, I'm good.
[86:45.49]A lot of these nominees just kind of... People nominated, I think, just to be funny.
[86:50.83]One of these nominees in particular, and we went through and we were like, all right, this was nominated...
[86:55.90]this was nominated like six times so we yeah we have to put it in we can't just like leave it out but it's not it's not it's barely anything you'll see the nominees for worst impression of the year whether of a video game character a celebrity or a that's not there's no other impressions there you go worst impression of the year the nominees are
[87:34.54]Hey, uh, hey.
[87:35.80]Uh.
[87:38.06]Okay, hey.
[87:39.06]Oh, boy, I need a, uh, I need to get myself some ice cream and, uh, some extra cola.

[87:44.79]I'm available!
[87:45.93]I am available.
[87:46.45]He's gonna rage a lot this stream.
[87:48.69]What?
[87:49.07]The Simpsons.
[87:50.61]How can you get mad at Homer Simpson?
[87:52.53]That's fucked up.
[87:53.85]Hahahaha.
[87:54.11]Hahahaha.
[88:14.91]I love how they have the combine voice.
[88:16.91]Just delete that whole clip.
[88:21.41]It was not even worth watching.
[88:25.39]What's the best Peter Griffin impression?
[88:26.63]You got it.
[88:29.56]Wait, do I have to walk behind the counter and make the change?
[88:34.56]Goofy, what the hell do you do here?
[88:35.82]$20.
[88:38.86]Well, I don't know anything about math, Donald.
[88:47.20]That's okay, Goofy.
[88:49.10]I'll take care of you.
[88:53.24]Okay, sure thing, Pip.
[88:54.44]I do that all the time.
[88:58.24]Oh, you're all about sex, aren't you, Quagmire?
[89:14.11]Alright, let's go.
[89:18.96]Can I jump?
[89:22.54]Oh, I can't wait to fight.
[89:23.58]I can do it.
[89:28.58]Hold on.
[89:30.41]No, I can't.
[89:32.29]It's too early.
[89:41.45]It's possible that this this one last year this one whatever who cares this one leg It's Donald Duck Donald fucking duck 17.8% of the vote Donald Duck won last year for worst impression.
[89:59.29]I just stopped just I should just not do Donald Duck anymore I'm just I'm never gonna do I will never do Donald Duck ever again.
[90:07.03]I'll never try I
[90:10.51]Hold on, let me take a quick wine break.
[90:13.89]Should I try it now?
[90:14.67]Try it now.
[90:22.91]All right.
[90:23.51]Fucking, it's 2019 still, fuck you.
[90:37.00]Donald Duck with 17.8%.
[90:37.86]By the way,
[90:41.16]This was very close.
[90:43.16]Canadian Homer Simpson was at 16.7% of the vote.
[90:50.51]17.8% for Donald and 16.7% for Homer Simpson.
[90:54.57]It was all awful.
[90:55.91]And there were two Peter Griffiths.
[90:59.71]Just like the bad ones, there are also some good ones.
[91:03.22]I do have at least...
[91:07.23]Like half a tank of talent, okay?
[91:09.39]I'm not going to say I got a full tank of talent.
[91:11.50]I got a half a tank of talent.
[91:14.14]Look, you got to know what you have.
[91:17.60]Best impression of the year coming up.
[91:20.66]Here are the nominees.
[91:23.12]Get off the screen.
[91:40.12]I see some of you guys in this chat with your mouths going... You bit your controller because you lost one of these missions like 15 times in a row.
[91:51.23]I know it.
[91:51.87]Jerma, how is it possible that you can be this bad?
[91:54.85]How is it possible?
[91:55.51]It's the only thing that...
[92:06.70]It's... It's Joan Rivers?
[92:09.52]Oh, Joan Rivers.
[92:10.80]Absolutely.
[92:11.52]It's unbelievable.
[92:12.36]Oh, darling, you look so beautiful right now on the runway.
[92:15.46]Let me tell you something about just how... I forgot about the fucking... I forgot.
[92:19.53]Fucking let's go.
[92:20.59]I can't fix it.
[92:21.47]I think I have this voice forever.
[92:23.17]I have this voice forever.
[92:24.53]I fucked it up.
[92:25.71]I coughed too much and now it's over.
[92:27.13]I actually have this voice forever.
[92:29.85]This is it.
[92:30.33]My career is over.
[92:31.57]Woohoo!
[92:32.81]Yes!
[92:35.09]You know, that's why this game is so difficult, actually, now that I think about it.
[92:38.63]Because... If you... It's like triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle, L. Right?
[92:43.79]That's easy.
[92:44.33]Triangle, triangle, triangle, triangle, L. But the way that he talks... It's just... It's not... It doesn't add up for my brain.
[92:54.28]Jerma, can you pretend to be Elmo Thanos for the rest of the stream?
[92:58.80]Uh-uh.
[93:14.83]Reality is often... Mr. Noodle!
[93:19.19]Reality is often disappointing, Mr. Noodle.
[93:25.61]That's all you get.
[93:28.05]Alright, whoever can do a better Gollum impression, uh, wins the contest.
[93:30.75]Okay, uh, go.
[93:31.69]Your turn.
[93:33.00]Go, your turn.
[93:34.54]Go, go, go!
[93:35.00]Um... Uh... I win.
[93:46.07]There's going to be a post-human, post-human apocalypse.
[93:48.57]I'm telling you, post-human.
[93:51.39]What's going to happen is the Seaman are going to come up here.
[93:57.70]I swear to God.
[93:58.60]The Seaman are going to come up.
[94:00.96]And they are going to totally, just absolutely wipe us out.
[94:03.92]And the globalists are going to take over with the Seaman.
[94:05.96]And then it goes real high.
[94:08.02]It goes real high, Joe.
[94:10.81]Sorting algorithm noise?
[94:16.11]Oh, yeah.
[94:16.61]I know what you're talking about.
[94:17.53]The things that... Yeah.
[94:21.55]Oh, you're killing me.
[94:22.57]Yep.
[94:25.74]Oh, I have to listen to it now.
[94:27.30]Then it goes like... Oh, I have to hear it right now.
[94:30.06]Let's go.
[94:58.08]Don't you think your mother has had enough aggravation, carrying you in her belly for nine long months?
[95:05.30]Stop being a freeloader and step out into the real world.
[95:19.77]Violence only begins with violence, Eddie.
[95:22.27]Do it, man.
[95:22.69]Come on.
[95:23.61]Okay, let's go.
[95:34.62]I cut that one off accidentally.
[95:39.26]Like I said, I'm going to have to take it down.
[95:43.74]Ooh.
[95:49.50]The winner is Best Impression of the Year.
[95:51.88]Why?
[95:51.96]I don't... What do you think?
[96:06.87]Thanos Elmo.
[96:08.57]With 22.5% of the vote, Elmo was there last year too.
[96:13.10]How many times have I done Elmo on this stream?
[96:20.30]Elmo, here's what I don't understand, okay?
[96:22.62]Let me give you, I want to break down some data for you.
[96:26.68]So, apparently, one of the worst things I did as an impression for last year was torture me Elmo.
[96:36.00]That got like 15% of the vote.
[96:39.50]But also, Thanos Elmo won best impression.
[96:45.67]How could I be on two different categories?
[96:48.21]I don't understand.
[96:50.87]Sorting algorithm was in second place, followed by Ed, Edd, and Eddie.
[96:54.59]Both at about 12% respectively.
[97:00.53]Thanos, Elmo.
[97:01.05]All right, now we're getting into the real stuff here.
[97:06.73]Still plenty of categories to go.
[97:07.97]Still a lot of categories to go.
[97:11.69]Coming up next is... We make a lot of jokes on this stream, first of all.
[97:19.75]Some of them are better than others.
[97:21.37]Some of them take a lot of time.
[97:23.89]And they either land or they don't.
[97:27.77]These are the nominees for the worst joke of the year that took more than five minutes to set up.
[97:45.69]You good?
[97:46.05]Are you good, Atto?
[97:49.33]Yeah, he's good.
[97:51.59]Yeah, so this is the worst joke of the year that took more than five minutes to set up.
[97:55.31]Whether that's finding clips and images or getting sounds ready and that, all right, it's been like 15 straight minutes.
[98:02.11]Let's try to make something funny happen.
[98:03.57]And it didn't work out so well.
[98:05.99]Here are the nominees for worst joke of the year that took more than five minutes to set up.
[98:15.56]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[98:22.80]Welcome to my scary, horrible portion of the stream if you don't know who I am.
[98:29.53]Oh, you'll get better.
[98:30.49]I tried to put together something and it didn't turn out perfectly.
[98:34.20]That's fine.
[98:35.58]As long as the essence of death...
[98:40.07]I've got luck I'm here with my friends.
[98:41.59]I've got my friends here.
[98:42.73]We're all doctors here.
[98:44.07]This guy's taking up my fucking limelight here.
[98:46.34]Get out of the way.
[98:51.87]All right, the nominees for best joke taking more than five minutes to set up.
[98:59.22]Joel Ray incoming?
[99:01.06]Is that for real?
[99:02.84]So how do I prepare?
[99:03.52]What do I do?
[99:03.84]How do I prepare for this?
[99:05.14]Everyone would be laughing your ass off, right?
[99:07.40]Like, I want only LULs in the chat.
[99:10.06]The cat is seriously up in the tree.
[99:13.31]And I'm trying to find a way.
[99:14.99]I put on swimmies, right?
[99:17.29]To try to climb the tree better, to think maybe there's gonna be grip.
[99:21.75]I know, it's crazy.
[99:23.34]Wait, did we get a raid?
[99:25.22]Hold on, I'm in the middle of telling this crazy, crazy story that happened to me when I was, like, fucking 19.
[99:30.32]Hey!
[99:32.60]Hey, Edna!
[99:34.96]Does the TV work yet?
[99:37.72]Maybe just adjust it a little to the left.
[99:40.99]Say hello, teleport to the tractor, sleep for a week.
[99:45.04]Teleport to the truck, say hello, teleport to the tractor, sleep for a week.
[99:49.14]Until I marry this person.
[99:52.20]This is bullshit and I'll tell you why.
[99:54.24]I don't think anybody's played this game.
[99:56.16]There's no way.
[99:59.14]Since one game hour is about five minutes, that means 12 hours in game you can talk to the ladies.
[100:04.39]Wait, what?
[100:05.75]You can only compliment them once per real hour.
[100:12.41]there's so much science as to what the heck is this even is it energy is it a time paradox
[100:37.95]Is it aliens?
[100:39.20]Did aliens make this?
[100:40.26]I don't know.
[100:40.80]It's so many questions that I have.
[100:43.59]We'll never know the answers to.
[101:11.54]So before I reveal the winner of this category, I have to make something very, very clear.
[101:18.70]Sometimes you spend some money and time and resources and you think something's a really great idea.
[101:26.07]And fucking rumor.
[101:27.89]Get the fuck out of here.
[101:30.41]Sometimes you have some ideas that don't play out so well, even if you hope they do.
[101:37.38]And with
[101:41.08]39% of the vote by a majority.
[101:45.94]And this fucking kind of annoys me in a way, and I'll tell you why.
[101:57.63]Bugleberry making pottery with almost 40% of the vote.
[102:04.82]Now, here's where this is bad, and this is why this sucks the most for me.
[102:11.45]Because I had to take pottery classes to learn how to do that.
[102:20.30]You notice how I knew what the fuck I was doing?
[102:22.98]I went to pottery class to know how to do that.
[102:31.99]And it turns out it was the worst thing I did all year.
[102:37.04]It's okay.
[102:39.02]Look, like I said, if you play baseball, if you're a baseball player and you strike out seven times, as long as you hit three home runs, you're one of the best players in baseball.
[102:54.78]That's a 300 average.
[103:00.13]That took five days to set up.
[103:01.44]Took more than that.
[103:02.50]That was more than five minutes.
[103:03.90]That was like three weeks of learning how to do pottery and then setting up all the... But I love that stream.
[103:14.11]I love that stream.
[103:15.37]By the way, that stream is nominated for best stream of the year.
[103:18.59]So look, you can have a bad part of one good stream.
[103:23.64]And I know everybody fucking hates Bugleberry.
[103:25.98]Bugleberry won worst character last year.
[103:28.48]He ain't going anywhere.
[103:30.24]He ain't going anywhere.
[103:31.08]He's going to be the next big event.
[103:33.33]He ain't ever fucking going anywhere.
[103:35.15]He's going to be at every single event.
[103:36.89]And I will... Those of you that might be new to the channel, when I did that segment with Bugleberry, I think we had 8,000 concurrent viewers, right?
[103:45.85]The second that Bugleberry came on stream, we dropped, I believe, 3,000 viewers.
[103:53.72]We went from 8,000 concurrent down to like 5,000 concurrent instantly.
[103:58.58]I don't even give a shit.
[104:03.10]He's coming back.
[104:06.90]Just like there are bad jokes that take more than five minutes to set up, there are also good ones apparently.
[104:11.70]Here is the nominee category for best joke of the year that took more than five minutes to set up.
[104:20.16]We'll see.
[104:29.09]Oh, it's beautiful, Jack.
[104:31.93]It sure is.
[104:37.05]Okay, let me put you down.
[104:41.31]Oh, it's beautiful, I know.
[104:42.67]Just watch out.
[104:43.81]Watch out for the railing.
[104:45.41]Watch out!
[104:46.21]Oh my fucking god.
[104:50.62]Is he wearing lipstick?
[105:02.63]You smell a nosy dog who's going to get smacked if he don't stop asking questions.
[105:13.48]Fucking said on the package that it wasn't gonna come off.
[105:21.71]Bro, I can't do this.
[105:23.25]This is an acting, okay.
[105:24.88]This is, this is an acting class.
[105:28.12]You want to learn how to act?
[105:29.08]You want to learn how to compose yourself during a scene?
[105:31.20]They should do this in workshops.
[105:32.56]I should run a workshop and do this.
[105:44.79]We try again.
[105:47.13]And again.
[106:04.38]But sometimes, the right one for you.
[106:12.11]It's not working.
[106:14.17]It's not working.
[106:16.37]I just ate like a person.
[106:19.37]What did I eat right here?
[106:21.85]Get off.
[106:22.79]What do you guys want to do?
[106:25.39]I can barely do anything.
[106:27.10]I really don't want to lie to you guys, but I seriously fucking can't do shit right now.
[106:32.40]Story Story 3 was really good.
[106:33.66]Somebody asked in the chat.
[106:34.44]I just want to make sure that I answered it.
[106:39.09]Yeah, Story Story 3.
[106:42.47]Story Story 4 was okay too.
[106:43.31]I liked it.
[107:08.27]Okay, I'm not even kidding.
[107:09.73]On January 23rd, I'm gonna, like, Final Destination movie my house.
[107:15.47]I'm serious.
[107:16.81]I just fucked myself.
[107:17.89]Three minutes!
[107:18.41]Get out of the way.
[107:23.01]Right here, I'm gonna just lie down.
[107:32.41]That was relaxing.
[107:35.58]Here's the thing, Kip.
[107:38.22]When you buy used games, make sure, very, very important kids, always, under every circumstance, make sure that you get exactly what you paid for in that box.
[107:49.56]Because if it doesn't come in there, you end up in a scenario like this.
[107:54.56]Ooh, and he doesn't have the other disc.
[107:57.69]I freaking can't.
[108:08.58]I hope that one wins.
[108:14.92]That was... What a great game.
[108:38.75]It's close.
[108:42.81]It was close.
[108:54.44]Farting and screaming playlist at the gym.
[109:00.12]With 29.4% of the vote.
[109:04.38]Very closely followed by, Jerma dies at 20.9%.
[109:08.22]There you go.
[109:14.41]Best joke of the year that took more than five minutes to set up.
[109:19.58]Titanic was robbed.
[109:21.22]That's a big category, so I'll give you... Worst joke, by the way.
[109:25.80]Bugleberry destroyed.
[109:27.69]But after that, at fifth... Oh, God.
[109:30.58]People fucking hated that.
[109:32.92]People hated that shit so much.
[109:38.06]40% for Bugleberry for worst.
[109:39.64]And then trying to get married in Farmer's Dynasty was number two.
[109:46.54]Best joke taking more than five minutes was farting and screaming playlist and then Gerber dies.
[109:50.10]And then right after that was the iconic Titanic scene at 17.8%.
[109:59.89]This next category, this next category is one of the biggest categories of the night.
[110:09.88]I got 10K viewers?
[110:11.88]Holy shit.
[110:16.14]Hey, what's up?
[110:18.88]That's pretty good.
[110:21.58]Pretty cool.

[110:36.03]This is the worst noise that I made on stream in 2019.
[110:40.12]Whether that's exclaiming something loudly, whether that's making of being upset about something.
[110:44.66]This is the worst fucking thing I made out of my mouth.
[110:47.78]And this had the most nominations.
[110:51.23]There were, let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 official nominations.

[116:10.67]This is real.
[116:11.59]If you watch the VOD...
[116:13.78]I fucking said sorry like three times.
[116:16.06]I went over on like a rant about like, I'm fucking really sorry.
[116:19.36]I didn't mean to do that.
[116:20.22]I didn't mean to.

[119:51.68]That is unknown.
[119:53.80]You can't nominate that for anything because it's 9, 10, 11.

[122:16.34]Got it!
[122:16.78]Yes!
[122:17.12]How many points is that?
[122:19.36]And if it weren't for nosy characters like you, we'd practically own this world.
[122:26.35]So let's see you deal with this.
[122:29.95]Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[122:43.03]Holy shit, relax.
[122:51.56]This is the one.
[122:56.28]Wasn't even close.
[123:17.19]Dickhead driving by fucking fast.
[123:19.83]Uh, wasn't even close.
[123:21.87]The best noise of the year.
[123:31.13]Not even close.
[123:36.37]The slap.
[123:38.45]At 43.4% of the vote!
[123:44.10]Not only the best noise of the year, but probably the worst thing I've ever done to myself on stream.
[123:50.28]There's no way I can explain that clip.
[123:56.03]There's no way, I can't explain it.
[123:59.21]I told you, I've seen threads on Reddit and shit where people are like, he fucking did that on purpose to make, to like, what do you mean, I, I, I fail.
[124:07.58]Ah, fuck, that's the new slap.
[124:11.91]Like, people say, like, dude, he fucking did it on purpose.
[124:14.17]He hit him, he slapped himself in the face to get, like, views.
[124:17.55]I didn't.
[124:18.21]And, like, whatever.
[124:19.55]Like I said before, I probably should just own it and say that I did it on purpose.
[124:24.62]Because how do you explain that?
[124:25.76]Like, oh, I was looking at, like, the fucking preview monitor and trying to cue up a sound.
[124:29.40]You can't.
[124:29.88]There's no, I can't.
[124:30.96]That had to be on purpose.
[124:39.24]Slap past the torch to the ayaya fall.
[124:45.02]God dammit!
[124:55.55]And I look in the camera too when I fall!
[124:59.91]Like it had to be on purpose!
[125:01.81]That had to be on purpose!
[125:08.53]Coming up next.
[125:11.85]Coming up next is... This one had a shitload of nominations.
[125:20.02]Best scare of the year.
[125:22.04]Whether I was scared by something in game or scared by a video or scared by a jump scare.
[125:26.68]Best scare of the year.
[125:29.76]That's the new slap.
[125:30.94]Good.
[125:31.16]I'm glad it replaces.
[125:32.14]Once a year we'll replace it with something else.
[125:34.50]Best scare of the year coming up.
[125:37.34]Jump scares, any scares, you know, you know the deal.
[125:40.52]By this point.
[125:42.84]That's not correct.
[125:49.48]These are loud, by the way.
[125:54.85]Ahhhh!
[126:17.28]What the fuck, it's that guy!
[126:23.33]No, it's not.
[126:23.95]What a fucking idiot I am.
[126:28.53]Get away, please.
[126:30.59]I thought it was the fucking guy with the hat on.
[126:33.92]Oh my god, that would have been the wor- oh, that would have been one of the scariest things ever in a video game.
[126:39.06]It still kinda was.
[126:40.00]And I'm gonna die, I need to heal.
[126:41.60]Alright, that's a jack.

[127:23.66]Okay, goodbye.
[127:27.80]There's a little one hanging out somewhere.
[127:36.80]god damn it that's the fucking worst thing that's ever happened to me in a game without a doubt that's the scariest because I know I have zero health and that's like 30 minutes of that was really really really real that was real that's that's what would happen if a monster tried to kill me in real life I can't believe

[129:47.98]It's like elephant poop.
[129:56.49]Oh my god!
[130:08.36]What are you doing?

[131:28.36]That's me.
[131:28.98]I'm Jerma.
[131:30.14]The VR scare just took it.
[131:31.71]It was 44% of the vote.
[131:36.01]It crushed it.
[131:38.07]I thought I was going to die.
[131:39.15]I really thought I was going to die.
[131:43.01]Because when you're in VR, you have no perception of anything around you.
[131:49.69]And when you feel physical violence on you,
[131:53.50]You're just like, I'm dead.
[131:55.70]I'm fucking dead in real life.
[131:58.70]Six minutes until New Year's.
[132:00.60]We got plenty of categories.
[132:02.04]Everybody calm down.
[132:02.82]What the fuck?
[132:06.16]Eight, yeah, we got like six minutes.
[132:08.82]We got another category to do.
[132:10.13]Just relax.
[132:11.49]How much more wine do I have?
[132:13.41]Did I drink this much wine already?
[132:18.19]I guess I did.
[132:32.18]He's drunk.
[132:32.74]I'm fucking drinking.
[132:33.96]It's New Year's Eve.
[132:36.64]It's not like July 22nd, okay?
[132:40.48]It's New Year's Eve.
[132:42.40]I can have a few glasses of wine.
[132:46.97]Yeah, KimVR.
[132:47.79]What was after that?
[132:52.17]Far away.
[132:54.93]One HP in the vent on the thing.
[132:57.52]Yeah.
[133:03.20]1.8, that was the worst.
[133:05.08]To give some context on that clip, the thing is a fucking, it sucks.
[133:10.55]The thing sucks.
[133:12.63]It's one of the best, that's one of the best streams I've done all year.
[133:15.73]I love that stream.
[133:17.35]I hate that game.
[133:21.35]The first like 15 hours of the thing is okay.
[133:25.49]But you did it because of money.
[133:30.99]That's not even true.
[133:32.31]Not even true.
[133:33.85]But in that game, the save points, I had one HP and I played that same fucking routine over and over and over again.
[133:46.08]If I died by that little monster, I would have had to come back and play 40 minutes of the game again.
[133:52.22]That would have been horrible.
[133:55.79]People are spamming a link.
[134:09.30]I don't even look like this.
[134:12.30]I really don't even look like this.
[134:25.68]That's not even the same person.
[134:37.13]Coming up next on the New Year's Eve festivities.
[134:41.82]We're gonna count down the new year.
[134:43.56]It's almost midnight Eastern.
[134:46.10]I don't think we have time.
[134:48.36]I can open a clock.
[134:53.90]It's three minutes.
[134:55.00]We have like fucking ten categories.
[135:05.08]I'm not, no, no, we gotta wait.
[135:06.24]We gotta wait.
[135:07.99]We have to wait.
[135:08.75]Don't spoil categories.
[135:18.96]Two minutes.
[135:21.02]Until it's New York time.
[135:22.88]I live in fucking Las Vegas.
[135:25.46]What do I care if it's midnight Eastern?
[135:32.47]We're close.
[135:35.54]We gotta... No, no, no.
[135:37.24]Don't play that yet.
[135:41.78]Ah, we gotta sit here.
[135:44.62]Your most... Look, I thought... Every... It's all Eastern.

[140:17.55]Sometimes, on this stream, we, uh, I can't get over the fact that I fell down on my chair.
[140:32.59]Apologize for falling.
[140:33.97]What the fuck?
[140:34.51]I'm sorry.
[140:35.71]Don't look at the fucking winner.
[140:38.21]I know the winner.

[142:29.56]I want to na- I've been thinking about this, and if my calculations are correct, you must be a virgin, right?
[142:38.32]I meant Virgo.
[142:41.20]Sorry, I know Virgos are very sensitive.
[142:44.27]I hope I didn't hurt your feelings.
[142:46.41]No, I'm not, so, sorry.

[144:41.15]And I'm gonna do it.

[157:45.67]I had to stop to puke.
[157:48.35]Get in the chair!
[157:50.83]What are you doing?
[157:58.42]Oh, fuck it.
[158:00.52]Just play every machine here.
[158:01.92]Chances increase.
[158:02.80]Oh, what the fuck happened?
[158:08.86]No, the first person camera was not in the right spot and it was one hit.
[158:15.85]What the fuck was that?
[158:22.79]No way.
[158:23.85]I just like wasn't in the right spot.
[158:27.83]You've got to be kidding me.
[158:29.09]That was dumb.
[158:34.02]Oh no, I hate it!
[158:36.02]No!
[158:39.46]The whole thing has to be ice.
[158:44.54]The whole course.
[158:47.52]Sonic Racers didn't even have this shit.
[158:49.84]Mario Kart doesn't even have a level like this.
[158:53.20]Across the entire, like, 16 Mario Kart games.
[159:08.83]Yeah, I got called out.
[159:09.57]It's okay.
[159:13.47]The worst meltdown of the year.
[159:15.03]Not even close.
[159:19.93]Another category that just blew everything out.
[159:34.20]Simpsons hit and run.
[159:36.44]With 51.7% of the vote.
[159:40.07]That's a lot.
[159:41.47]That's a lot.
[159:44.61]That's one of the longest streams I've ever done.
[159:46.29]And I agree.
[159:49.39]That's the most fucked up I've ever been on camera.
[159:57.32]That's like the most angry, tired, and annoyed I've been in probably five years.
[160:03.80]Simpson's hit and run was the worst meltdown by far.
[160:09.32]If you want to know the runners-up, sure, we can do that.
[160:14.60]The next one was Jump King.
[160:16.89]And after that was The Thing.
[160:19.49]By the way, Jump King was 15.9% of the vote.
[160:32.14]All right, we are at the final four categories and these are big ones.
[160:36.08]These are really big ones.
[160:37.76]These are huge.
[160:40.60]This next category is the worst stream of the whole fucking year.
[160:48.65]The stream that was not even funny.
[160:51.73]That was a waste of fucking time.
[160:53.84]That was like, why did you turn it on in the first place?
[160:57.22]The worst stream of the year.
[161:02.68]Yeah, get a better joke.
[161:04.12]You guys said this last year too.
[161:06.36]Oh, this one.
[161:07.62]This one's the fucking worst.
[161:09.28]You said that last year.
[161:10.81]And look at how it turned out for you.
[161:12.23]No, you said that last year.
[161:13.33]Ain't gonna happen this year.
[161:15.17]No, 2019, 2018, same damn fucking story.
[161:20.97]What was the worst stream of the year?
[161:23.13]I know what I think it is.
[161:25.36]But maybe you have a different... Maybe slightly different story.
[161:31.89]This is one of the big categories.
[161:35.70]You motherfuckers.
[161:41.68]This is the category of the what the worst stream of 2019.
[161:52.31]What is the worst stream of the year?
[161:55.39]Here we go.
[162:03.45]I'm so mad right now.
[162:05.65]Does anybody see Jake?
[162:15.29]I don't know what to do.
[162:17.15]No more.
[162:20.09]What, you didn't like squeaking sausage?
[162:21.85]You didn't like this?
[162:23.47]You want to do another fucking card game?
[162:26.33]No, no, no, anything but that.
[162:28.63]Do anything else.
[162:30.21]I don't want to see this again.
[162:33.94]That tonight's gonna be a good night!
[162:38.96]That tonight's gonna be a good night!
[162:46.55]That tonight's gonna be a good good night!
[162:50.61]Ba-do-do ba-do-do ba-do ba-do ba-do ba-do ba-do ba-do ba-do ba-do ba-do ba-do ba-do
[163:02.12]He's a normie.
[163:04.66]I know you're gonna scream.
[163:05.56]I know that.
[163:06.08]I already told you you're gonna be mad.
[163:08.68]What's happening?
[163:14.54]Get out.
[163:14.94]Leave.
[163:15.24]Don't come to the stream.
[163:16.78]The stream is not one you want to watch.
[163:18.57]I'm not very good at this game and I look over here and I see...
[163:22.12]Like a wall of people fucking holding up notes.
[163:26.64]Sticking them to the wall.
[163:28.12]Hey, look at this!
[163:29.70]You have to do it like this quick!
[163:32.06]I know we're supposed to play Halo Reach on Legendary Difficulty.
[163:35.53]But what if we just make... But what if we just make the ground that we're walking on made out of bodies?
[163:40.47]I can't even show you a video.
[163:43.25]You're gonna go to my stream!
[163:46.07]We have to go on to your stream.
[163:47.93]Watch my stream right now.
[163:49.31]No, you already pressed the button.
[163:50.74]You pressed the button.
[163:52.38]Okay, well, the fucking boat is pressed.
[163:54.78]I just want... Think before you speak.
[163:58.26]What are you saying?
[164:00.19]Hey, you don't want to talk about reaching into the toilet and, like, pulling up, like, drain pipes.
[164:37.37]oh god damn it the worst stream of the year of all of 2019
[165:12.75]Halo Reach with Joel Halo Reach with Joel with 30% of the vote Below that was the Hearthstone stream
[165:36.69]I can agree with that.
[165:38.88]I think the worst stream of the year was the unlock card game stream.
[165:44.52]Try to do something different.
[165:48.92]It was so bad.
[165:54.21]That's the worst stream I've ever done.
[165:58.09]Regardless of what everybody says.
[166:00.50]That's the worst stream I've ever done on this channel.
[166:04.83]Call Joel.
[166:06.31]Would he like to know that he won worst stream of the year?
[166:09.29]Is he here?
[166:13.88]Joel, hey, we won!

[166:47.27]It's not going to fucking happen.
[166:51.65]He blocked you.
[166:55.83]The Halo Reach.
[166:57.09]I was so into Halo Reach.
[166:58.41]I wanted to play it so fucking bad, too.
[167:01.70]That's the worst part about all this, is I was so, I was like, hey guys, I've never played Halo before in my whole life.
[167:07.74]I can't wait to play Halo.
[167:09.32]It's gonna be so much fun, man.
[167:10.64]I've never played fucking Halo 1, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo, I've never played any fucking Halos.
[167:15.53]And it's the worst stream I've ever done.
[167:22.91]I can't even go back, I can't go back to Halo.
[167:27.81]It was, you know, it was the card game.
[167:29.11]It was the fucking unlocked card game.
[167:30.80]That game sucked.
[167:32.64]Alright.
[167:35.60]It was me and Joel playing Halo.
[167:37.48]Okay.

[170:15.29]Peter!
[170:15.97]What is Beater?
[170:17.09]What?
[170:17.39]Oh, it's Beater!
[170:23.20]Holy shit, this is disgusting.
[170:25.60]You put extra in this one.
[170:31.14]Soaring and slithering, how high can he go?
[170:33.49]This is the point where the streamer gave up.
[170:49.59]But you can do it if you want to, otherwise just fly in the sky.
[170:54.89]Oh, I don't know that.
[170:57.35]Oh, hold on a minute.
[170:58.39]Oh, shoot, my frog.
[170:59.43]Quick, zoom in.
[171:00.89]I'll pick it up.
[171:01.47]I didn't know that.
[171:02.89]I'll pick it up.
[171:03.65]There's god damn it.
[171:04.95]See?
[171:05.19]Reference.
[171:05.53]That's the one that... That made me famous.
[171:07.86]You wanna fight?
[171:10.94]Don't look at that.
[171:12.94]Don't... That did happen on that stream.
[171:16.58]It's true.
[171:22.59]That did happen on that stream.
[171:26.67]Ladies and gentlemen, the best stream of 2019.
[171:29.87]The Robot Carnival with 47% of the vote.
[171:50.72]After that is Simpsons Hit and Run.
[171:54.48]With 14% of the vote.
[172:00.15]Had a lot of fun on that stream.
[172:02.17]Robot Carnival.
[172:04.79]There it is.
[172:05.33]Best stream of the year, apparently.
[172:09.65]We're at the end of the night here.
[172:12.73]We have a couple more categories to do.
[172:14.65]Two very important categories.
[172:21.58]Because I've been doing this for such a long time.
[172:25.78]We have the worst joke of the decade and the best joke of the decade.
[172:36.96]I did YouTube six years or so before I did Twitch.
[172:43.37]Those are included.
[172:46.29]Twitch is just about 40 to 50% of the whole time I've spent on these platforms.
[172:53.21]He was a tuber.
[172:56.16]So these hold a very special place in my heart.
[172:58.45]They really do.
[172:59.31]Even the worst ones.
[173:00.47]Even the shittiest joke of the whole decade.
[173:04.97]I've been here for a long time.
[173:07.61]And I seriously cannot even comprehend this 11,500 fucking people here.
[173:16.83]There's a lot of people.
[173:20.27]I'm shocked that there's this many people that think this stream is worth being a part of.
[173:26.63]or the YouTube channel from 10 years ago.
[173:30.43]So from the bottom of regardless of what wins worst joke and best joke of the decade.
[173:35.81]Thanks for making this possible.
[173:38.61]And let's hope 2020 is as fun as the 2010s because it was like it's been a fucking blast.
[173:46.71]Seriously, thank you everybody.
[173:50.23]Without further ado, let's move on to the worst joke of the whole decade.
[173:58.25]Somebody just dropped 50 fucking subs.
[174:01.87]Barry Sachse, 50 subs right at the New Year.
[174:06.31]Thank you.
[174:10.63]That's a lot of subs.
[174:14.78]50 subs.
[174:19.42]There were a lot of nominees for best joke of the decade.

[177:56.45]Honest to God, like you guys have changed my fucking life.
[178:00.13]I'm dressing up like a dickhead, but you've changed my entire goddamn life.

[181:22.89]Here's the worst thing I've ever done.
[181:23.89]We got resident sleepers in the chat.
[181:28.88]Like a resident sleeper.
[181:31.32]And I'm not even upset about it.
[181:32.76]That's kind of funny.

[181:39.43]I love you guys.
[181:49.65]Here's the full OST of Star Wars!
[181:52.67]And then Inter caught in the middle like a siren.

[182:52.29]Around this corner, we got some butter.
[182:56.58]And then, of course, you cannot forget... Fucking... You roll your sleeves up, get your hands a little bit dirty, and you add a little bit more butter.

[205:19.54]Hope to make friends with everyone in the new year.
[205:22.67]Love y'all.
[205:23.17]Hope everyone has a great 2020.
[205:26.97]I wish you and especially your father the best.
[205:30.53]Cancer sucks.
[205:32.61]I wish your father the absolute best.
[205:37.66]It is our pleasure to keep you company for this long.
[205:41.86]All through 2019.
[205:44.16]Thank you.
[205:48.27]Much love to you.
[205:49.85]Thank you so much for the thousand bits, the $10.
[205:55.53]Thank you to Jerk McCurk for the 800 bits.
[205:59.17]Happy New Year, Jerma.
[206:00.15]Thanks for helping me get through the decade.
[206:02.88]Love you, bro.
[206:05.19]I could say the same thing to you.
[206:08.25]And it would be real.
[206:12.07]Thanks.
[206:14.83]Appreciate it.
[206:17.31]Thank you for the $8.
[206:21.05]Jerk.
[206:21.69]McCurk.
[206:25.53]Captain Clutch TM, thanks for the 300 bits.
[206:27.77]Let's start the new year off right.
[206:29.21]Happy New Year.
[206:31.07]Happy New Year to you, too.
[206:35.42]Hope you have a good one.
[206:39.16]Kelsey, Kelsey VA, thanks for the 500 bits.
[206:42.06]Please wish me a happy birthday, Jerma.
[206:44.30]Cake and ice cream is on its way.
[206:45.40]Happy birthday, Kelsey.
[206:47.76]Have a good birthday.
[206:50.20]Take care of yourself.
[206:50.78]Hope you have a good birthday on New Year's Eve.
[206:52.48]Damn.
[206:53.80]That's pretty great.
[206:57.29]Buttsquire, thanks for the $20, Buttsquire.
[206:59.85]2,000 bits from Buttsquire.
[207:02.67]I made the original You Are Now Cursed picture.
[207:05.63]And I have nothing to do with those coasters.
[207:08.63]I also made the two other You Are Now Cursed images.
[207:11.39]So would I be suing?
[207:21.50]I don't know if you have a case.
[207:25.24]But thanks for the 2,000 bits.
[207:27.80]20 fucking dollars.
[207:28.34]That's a lot of money.
[207:28.96]Thank you.
[207:31.22]Hey, Sad Vega, thanks for 250.
[207:32.46]Germa!
[207:34.18]I'm not sure where, but there's probably a bot pulling images from either Twitter or Discord.
[207:41.08]If you put an image that said, this is stolen artwork, do not buy, report it.
[207:46.40]They'd probably put it up on the shop.
[207:49.76]That's true.
[207:50.18]Yeah, that's true.
[207:56.18]Hey, Morning Maple, thanks for 500 bits.
[207:58.31]This is like a Redbubble version of the Daffy Duck skit, where he's fighting against the animator.
[208:04.61]Yeah.
[208:05.85]That was real life.
[208:08.49]You didn't thank Elliot Mills for their countless stolen fucking assets.
[208:13.41]I know.
[208:13.69]What's wrong with me?
[208:15.17]Why wouldn't I do that?
[208:20.23]The Tombow.
[208:21.03]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[208:22.23]Appreciate that.
[208:23.07]Thanks, Tombow.
[208:23.85]No message.
[208:26.06]Holeof1zombie, thanks for the thousand bits.
[208:27.92]Thanks for streaming.
[208:28.56]Really appreciate the laughs.
[208:30.02]You've raised the bar and chat has helped with some brilliant moments.
[208:33.82]I got to make the 5G gum joke yesterday.
[208:36.68]It was a blast seeing that evolve.
[208:38.74]Happy New Year, everyone.
[208:40.80]Happy New Year.
[208:42.62]Holeof1zombie, you've been around for a long time.
[208:44.44]Thank you.
[208:46.54]MetroJelly, $15 from MetroJelly.
[208:49.36]Bits for Otto.
[208:51.04]Also, sorry for making the dick phone case and scaring you.
[208:54.80]You made that thing?
[208:57.35]What?
[208:59.79]Well, delete it.
[209:04.31]Uh, Cthulhu Syndrome, thanks for the $25, 2500 bits.
[209:09.65]Get a bowl cut now.
[209:11.94]You know, I did get a haircut today, and I was thinking, should I get a bowl cut?
[209:15.24]And I was like, nah, I have to have that for like a month.
[209:17.66]No.
[209:19.70]Not getting a bowl cut.
[209:20.64]Not gonna happen.
[209:26.71]I appreciate the 25 fucking dollars, though.
[209:28.53]That's a lot of money.
[209:29.19]Thank you.
[209:31.25]Balla Koala, thanks for the five dollars.
[209:33.27]Hey, Germa, by this point, you've probably seen this, but apparently Lil Nas X is a fan.
[209:38.48]The dude who did Old Town Road, you boomer.
[209:41.26]I can't fucking believe that.
[209:46.64]That's ridiculous.
[209:47.92]I seriously can't believe it.
[209:57.56]He's probably watching.
[209:58.58]Well, thank you, Lil Nas.
[209:59.94]I'm shocked.
[210:01.68]Thank you.
[210:04.30]Old town rats.
[210:09.46]Don't forget us when you're famous.
[210:10.84]How could I ever forget you guys?
[210:14.46]You got me here in the first place.
[210:16.19]You serious?
[210:21.67]And plus, it was just a little fun tweet.
[210:23.73]It's not a big deal.
[210:28.82]Not a big deal.
[210:31.84]Also... Uh-oh, I lost my place.
[210:35.46]Where am I?
[210:36.78]Where the fuck am I?
[210:41.97]How did I lose my place?
[210:42.73]What?
[210:45.07]Oh, there we are.
[210:46.67]Vilemi, thanks for the thousand bits, Vilemi.
[210:49.07]I'm glad at least the chat agrees that the doctors were the best joke of the year.
[210:53.87]Well, it was nominated for worst joke of the year, so... I've got bad news for you.
[211:00.25]Balla Koala, thanks for the 1,500 bits.
[211:03.41]$15.
[211:04.59]German, just want to say thanks for the last year.
[211:06.99]You and your community did a lot for me in the past 365 days.
[211:10.57]Just want to say thanks.
[211:12.19]Wish I could give more money, but my job fell through and I'm back to contract work.
[211:16.82]So I got to be a bit more conservative with my money than I'd like.
[211:20.80]Anyways, excuse my rambling.
[211:22.44]I've been celebrating the new year.
[211:23.62]Just want to say thanks.
[211:25.90]Never under any circumstance ever feel obligated to give this channel money for any reason.
[211:30.76]Ever.
[211:31.28]Ever.
[211:32.00]For any fucking reason ever.
[211:36.21]You being here and watching is enough for me.
[211:39.01]Thank you.
[211:39.59]Seriously.
[211:41.55]Thanks a lot.
[211:44.05]No one is under any obligation to pay this channel money.
[211:49.42]Tell that to the people that gifted 2020 subs.
[211:53.66]It was a lot.
[211:55.47]It was a lot, but no one's ever supposed to do that.
[212:02.95]I hope you know that.
[212:06.17]We are encroaching on 10k subs now, and none of you have to do that.
[212:16.60]But you do.
[212:17.04]A lot of you do.
[212:21.23]I said it three or four times.
[212:23.21]I hope you think it's worth it.
[212:26.71]I really fucking hope you think it's worth doing.
[212:32.13]Seriously.
[212:34.15]I don't want you to give subs to this channel and look back and be like, ah, that was fucking stupid.
[212:38.22]What a dumb idea.
[212:40.84]I hope you think it's worth it.
[212:53.31]Thank you.
[212:55.47]Morning Maple, thanks for 300 bits.
[212:57.11]The pottery was good.
[212:58.24]Bugleberry wasn't.
[212:59.54]Damn it.
[213:00.04]That's real.
[213:01.90]It's a real statement.
[213:04.53]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the 550 bits.
[213:07.01]Happy New Year, Jerma.
[213:07.89]Hope 2019 was good for you.
[213:10.24]Just want to say that you win the category of best streamer of the decade in my heart.
[213:13.26]You do so much for this community.
[213:15.48]The fact that you took pottery lessons for a bit is so much dedication.
[213:20.42]Most streamers wouldn't do that.
[213:22.40]You're an amazing, funny person anyways.
[213:23.90]Hope 2020 is the best it can be for you.
[213:26.92]Keep up the dedication.
[213:29.72]I will.
[213:32.12]There's stuff in the works right now that is going to take months.
[213:36.47]But hopefully it's worth it.
[213:39.03]I think it will be.
[213:40.03]We'll see.
[213:44.68]Thank you, Hilly.
[213:48.26]Reaper, thanks for the 250.
[213:49.28]Hey, Jerma, when are you going to admit that Bugleberry is terrible and going to take him out back and shoot him so we can never see him again?
[213:56.10]Never.
[213:57.52]That's not going to happen.
[213:59.03]Erasmus, thanks for the 275.
[214:00.87]Bugleberry hindsight is 2020.
[214:02.61]Happy New Year, Jean-Claude.
[214:03.89]Thank you.
[214:04.19]Appreciate that.
[214:07.54]Vilemi gave 5,000 bits.
[214:10.26]No, 7,000 bits.
[214:12.86]$70.
[214:14.68]Derma Owu was the best noise of the year and no one can change my mind.
[214:18.40]$70 to say that.
[214:20.88]Jesus Christ.
[214:24.56]Thanks, Vilemi.
[214:27.53]Bullet Casing.
[214:28.39]Thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[214:30.43]Not to be trumped.
[214:33.21]$50 from Bullet Casing.
[214:36.10]I have literally never laughed this hard at another stream.
[214:38.26]You fucking deserve this, Jerma.
[214:39.58]Laugh my ass off.
[214:41.96]I'm glad you think that.
[214:46.92]I hope you continue to think that.
[214:48.44]If not, then I'm doing something wrong.
[214:51.08]I'm doing something wrong, if you're not having fun here.
[214:53.80]I'm doing something fucking wrong.
[214:57.59]And I'd like to correct it.
[215:00.63]Thank you.
[215:01.67]For the 5,000 bits.
[215:02.11]Seriously.
[215:06.55]Ah, yes is online.
[215:07.67]5,000 bits.
[215:09.26]So much money.
[215:11.22]Jesus Christ.
[215:16.00]Thank you for an amazing 2019.
[215:17.04]There's no other creator in the world that brings me as much joy and inspiration as you do.
[215:21.82]Much love to chat as well as for finding humor in literally anything.
[215:25.50]Here's to an amazing next decade.
[215:26.98]God bless you all.
[215:30.08]Those are incredibly nice things to say about anybody.
[215:36.30]I'm happy you say them about me.
[215:42.62]Thank you so much for the 50 goddamn dollars.
[215:47.09]Jesus.
[215:49.77]Small boss thanks for 500 bits.
[215:51.81]Hey, Jerma, you're unironically the greatest streamer on Twitch.
[215:54.55]I came home early to watch this and I regret it.
[216:01.51]That's pretty good.
[216:03.47]That's good.
[216:04.17]I like that one.
[216:06.15]Happy New Year.
[216:06.69]Happy New Year to you too, SmileBoss.
[216:08.13]Thanks for the $5.
[216:08.51]Shulvi, thanks for the $4.20.
[216:12.58]Happy 2020, you idiot.
[216:13.54]Thank you, Shulvi.
[216:21.06]It's at this point where we got an absolute ridiculous amount of community subs.
[216:25.46]I can't even fucking count them all.
[216:28.16]Just wait till you see the credits.
[216:29.54]It's gonna be crazy.
[216:30.74]It's gonna be the most ridiculous credits of all time.
[216:36.63]Noodle is bad at gaming.
[216:37.69]Thanks for 300 bits.
[216:38.75]I didn't have another dream about you last night.
[216:40.37]Well, that's good.
[216:41.71]But I had a trip to the ER this morning because I had a giant splinter in my hand.
[216:45.05]What the fuck?
[216:46.77]And I watched a VOD to help me through the pain.
[216:49.08]Thank you, Jermo.
[216:49.76]Hope you're alright.
[216:53.89]That doesn't sound good.
[216:55.47]That sounds like it hurts.
[216:58.99]But thank you, Noodle, for the 300 bits.
[217:02.17]Eco Leech, 1,500 bits from Eco Leech.
[217:04.95]Thanks for the $15, Eco.
[217:07.49]Happy New Year, Jeremy.
[217:08.27]You've been watching for about six years.
[217:10.59]Here's to another decade.
[217:13.83]Thank you so much for watching.
[217:14.89]Thanks for the $15.
[217:15.58]Eco Leech, appreciate that.
[217:22.15]Bitslave, thanks for the 300 bits.
[217:24.35]Happy New Year, Jerma.
[217:25.33]You help me more than any other person I know.
[217:27.71]Before I was struck with Depressio and suicidal thoughts, you helped me through that and kept me going.
[217:33.97]Now I'm happy in the Air Force and doing a job that I love.
[217:38.22]Thanks so much for the help.
[217:43.86]I'm glad you got through it.
[217:49.76]Keep working on yourself.
[217:52.25]Keep moving in the right direction.
[217:54.97]Much love to you.
[217:56.35]Seems like you're doing great things.
[217:57.47]Thanks for the 300 fucking bits.
[217:59.65]And thanks for being around for as long as you have.
[218:01.98]Of course, we all remember.
[218:04.82]Plain dead.
[218:06.86]Seriously, Bitslave, thank you.
[218:08.36]Good luck to you.
[218:12.20]We had $100 10,000 bits from Ape808.
[218:19.59]Thanks, Jerma, for entertaining me the last seven years.
[218:21.95]I started the decade in middle school.
[218:23.59]Jesus.
[218:24.87]And now I get to build actual spaceships for a living.
[218:28.11]Fucking engineers, I'm telling you.
[218:31.93]The boring parts in between would have been much worse without your brilliant, stupid comedy.
[218:40.32]Those are really nice things to say about me.
[218:43.30]I'm glad you think that.
[218:46.32]See if I can keep that in your mind.
[218:50.02]I think about that a lot.
[218:53.34]You know?
[218:54.85]Do people think this is funny?
[218:56.03]Are people into this?
[218:56.73]I hope you are.
[219:00.19]Thank you.
[219:01.83]For the $100.
[219:02.48]And that amazingly kind fucking message.
[219:06.58]Thank you.
[219:09.36]21, thanks for the 500 bits.
[219:09.98]Hey, Yermo, over the years, you've helped so many people through some tough times.
[219:15.02]And I thank you so much for everything you do.
[219:17.38]It's been so great to see your channel and brand grow from old TF2 days to where you are now.
[219:23.87]Your care and dedication to the community has me undoubtedly believing 2020 will have some more joy, growth, and prosperity for you in store.
[219:30.91]We love you and best regards.
[219:34.14]We'll see.
[219:37.24]It's been incredible, so.
[219:39.78]Even if 2020 is not, I've had a wild fucking ride, and I'm glad to participate, and I'm glad you guys got to join on the ride.
[219:48.45]It's been a lot of fun.
[219:50.31]I'm gonna keep going.
[219:54.13]Ape, thank you, Ape, again, for the $5.50.
[219:56.87]Best joke of the decade is the way you did your hair today.
[219:59.19]Thanks, man.
[220:07.45]That's pretty good.
[220:08.03]Hey, Surgilbutt, thanks for the thousand bits.
[220:11.89]I don't donate often and I'm definitely no 100 gift supper, but thanks for the year.
[220:16.97]P.S.
[220:17.39]Is Surgil like circle, not Surgil?
[220:19.47]Alright, well, Surgilbutt.
[220:21.43]Thanks, Surgilbutt.
[220:22.77]For the 10 bucks.

[220:50.08]Jesus Christ.
[220:52.28]Happy New Year, Jerma.
[220:53.22]Keep killing it in 2020.
[220:54.46]I'll try.

[222:00.65]You guys do a lot for me.
[222:03.13]A lot.
[222:04.74]So... It goes both ways.
[222:08.08]And potentially my way more than yours.
[222:10.48]I get a lot of fucking money and a lot of people and a lot of... I try to stay grounded, though.
[222:24.81]I don't want to think...
[222:27.13]Oh, there were 13,000 people here today.
[222:29.04]Oh, look at me.
[222:29.98]I just keep going, you know?
[222:38.15]Whatever.
[222:38.45]Let's go.
[222:38.93]Another day.

[223:44.65]I hope you keep liking the channel.
[223:47.57]I hope you think it's still fun.

[228:44.28]Like since months ago.
[228:45.40]I tried to laugh at the jokes during the best of the decade, but I was too choked up.

[238:12.95]Mission failed.
[238:16.35]Cry saved.
[238:19.79]Yeah, but you gotta think about it, right?
[238:22.65]When people say these things, it means a lot.
[238:30.06]If I'm that much of a positive influence on somebody, it's like, damn, that makes me fucking happy.
[238:36.92]I'm glad you take something good.
[238:43.10]It's not all positive.
[238:44.30]Like, life is not all positive, right?
[238:49.85]It's like, oh, positive, only positive, only fucking positive, only positive.
[238:53.41]It's not realistic.
[238:55.92]But if you have fun here and shit, and you've made friends and stuff, that means a lot.
[239:03.76]It really does.
[239:10.19]This community has fucking grown a lot, and there's a lot of people that have made friends and shit, and I'm so happy about that.
[239:23.83]People tell me, like, oh, dude, I was in the Discord.
[239:25.65]I've made, like, lifelong friends in the Discord and shit.
[239:28.25]It's, like, good.
[239:30.49]That's awesome.
[239:36.49]That's really awesome.
[239:50.23]More subs and shit have come in.
[239:54.31]The true Michi, thanks for the thousand bits.
[240:00.50]You know, I still remember when I first got on the stream.
[240:02.64]Uh, Chicky told me to visit him and we watched your stream together.
[240:41.12]I had such a blast with him, and since he's gone... I don't know, since he's away, I keep sticking around here from time to time.
[241:11.45]And you put a damn smile on my sad face every time.
[241:14.99]So thank you for everything, man.
[241:17.29]Thank you so much for talking to him.
[241:19.65]And thank you for being amazing.
[241:25.61]Those of you that don't know, I've never talked about it because there was no reason to.
[241:33.00]And there's no reason to talk about it now.
[241:38.17]there was somebody in the community that um was going through a lot of and had brain cancer and I hung out with them a few times and they were really really awesome they're a really good person and there's no reason to even go any further than that you know what I mean
[242:06.56]And somebody put me in contact, and it was... It was really awesome to hear the things that they had to say.
[242:14.32]They were a really fucking good person.
[242:20.11]And I'm really sad to know that they're gone.
[242:30.47]So... Yeah, I mean, this is a big deal for me.
[242:34.74]To...
[242:37.07]Michi, I think, was one of the people that put me in contact with him in the first place.
[242:39.97]And it's something I've never talked about on stream.
[242:43.32]So... But for real, much love to you, much love to Chicky.
[242:51.88]They were going through a lot.
[243:00.13]That hit me right in the chest.
[243:01.27]It did.
[243:01.45]It did.
[243:09.49]Thank you, Mitchie.
[243:15.32]For the thousand bits and for even putting me in contact in the first place with Chickie.
[243:24.87]Much love to them as well and their family.
[243:38.19]You know, sometimes you get real, right?
[243:39.65]Sometimes you get real.
[243:41.17]I'm not going to pretend like I'm going to put on some show 100% of the time.
[243:54.12]This is real shit.
[243:55.44]This is real shit.
[243:58.46]It is.
[243:58.76]I came here for laughs.
[244:04.79]Yeah, but it's...
[244:07.22]Sometimes you gotta be real.
[244:13.35]And just knowing that if I made somebody happy at all and I mean, this is what we're talking about.
[244:20.49]This is like a year ago, more than that.
[244:24.35]Thank you, Mitchie.
[244:25.27]I really appreciate the fucking thoughts and I really appreciate you coming in the stream.
[244:46.59]Because if people really, like I said before, I'm sorry, I just fucking punched you in the face.
[244:50.65]If people really get something from this stream and it's part of them, you know, that makes me fucking happy.
[244:59.52]What else could I ask for?
[245:00.92]What else could I possibly ask for?
[245:04.51]Oh, thanks for the $15.
[245:05.83]No, fuck.
[245:07.25]Who cares about money, right?
[245:08.73]Like, if you guys are happy, that's good.
[245:17.20]But that hits home because it's just... Just something to think about.
[245:36.08]I don't get very emotional on stream.
[245:41.16]But for stuff like that, I'm going to.
[245:44.66]And I'm not... That's just the way it is.
[245:52.70]We made him cry.
[245:53.74]No.
[245:54.74]No, I got choked up.
[245:58.10]And there's a good reason for it.
[246:00.70]But we can move on from that.
[246:12.86]Fuck you.
[246:13.38]You cried.
[246:14.12]I did.
[246:16.94]I did.
[246:17.38]I did.
[246:18.26]Yes, I did.
[246:19.10]I got a little emotional.
[246:21.92]Well, it's 2020.
[246:25.80]You guys don't even know.

[246:45.11]Everybody, I just gotta tell you.
[246:50.56]No, I like being real with you guys from time to time.
[246:53.80]We fuck around a lot, but sometimes you gotta be real.
[246:59.92]But seriously, rest in peace to Chicky.
[247:02.52]And much love to everybody in his family.

[256:20.77]Not the rest of the bits.
[256:21.55]Maybe a little bit.
[256:23.19]Maybe just a little bit.
[256:24.01]I can't fucking believe there's 10,000 subs on this channel.

[263:13.12]Thank you so much.
[263:13.86]Thank you for the $15 and the incredible support.
[263:18.09]Chunky Bologna.
[263:20.61]Chunky Bologna gave 250.
[263:21.97]Hey, Jerma, it's your sweet mate from 15 years ago.
[263:26.79]This is real.
[263:28.44]Chunky Bologna is my old college roommate.
[263:30.88]This is actually real.
[263:32.98]I can remember watching you play WoW in your dorm room as a gnome shouting for Gnomeregan as you ran around.
[263:40.42]Today you're basically doing the same exact thing, but with thousands of people watching you, you really haven't changed in that time, and that's honestly why you get 2,000 subs in a night.
[263:51.65]You're a genuine, entertaining person that doesn't need to pretend to be anything that you're not.
[263:56.02]And I think everyone here can see that.
[264:00.60]I can't pretend.
[264:01.22]I don't know what that is.
[264:02.20]I can't pretend.
[264:06.18]I don't know if I've tried pretending just... Oh, Kim is calling me.
[264:12.77]She's probably like, where are you?
[264:14.79]It's almost midnight!
[264:19.21]Alright, hold on.
[264:19.97]I gotta take this.
[265:37.04]Yeah, that was Kim.
[265:38.22]She's like, uh, I don't think anybody can get in here.
[265:43.36]Las Vegas on the Strip is crazy.
[265:46.51]So, we'll see if I can get out there.
[265:48.97]I'm going to be taking a Lyft.
[265:51.69]Hey, Lyft driver, can you get me to the Strip in 20 minutes?
[266:01.00]Get out of here.
[266:01.62]Get out of here.
[266:02.48]We're almost done.
[266:04.02]Lightning round.
[266:05.70]She actually said, I don't think you can get out here.
[266:07.44]So I was like, okay.
[266:17.50]Do the bits tomorrow?
[266:18.78]No, no, no, no, no.
[266:19.35]We're almost done.
[266:21.91]Try!
[266:22.47]Thanks for the $500.
[266:22.91]No, no, no.
[266:23.49]It's fine.
[266:23.95]She said I can't even get there anyway.
[266:25.19]So I'll see you in about 20 minutes.
[266:28.41]I'll be fine.
[266:28.77]Don't worry.

[270:46.25]If you have anything.
[270:48.59]He's trying to raise money to have some natural juices and natural foods to help with his brother's recovery.
[270:57.32]So, unfortunately, that is a true statement.

[271:19.21]Please stop booing.
[271:21.05]It's been quite a time, hasn't it, Jerma?
[271:22.71]I turned 40.
[271:23.03]Avengers did that thing.
[271:25.46]Star Wars did that thing.
[271:26.94]What a time to be alive.
[271:27.86]Well, wouldn't it be?
[271:28.70]I wouldn't be where I am without you, Jerma.
[271:31.66]Garfield owes a lot to you.
[271:33.00]I remember watching the Fat Guy NG vid all those years ago.
[271:38.75]Remember watching German Rumble 3 on New Year's Eve not so long ago.
[271:42.01]When you go to sleep, remember Garfield, Odie, and John Arbuckle think you're poggers.
[271:49.18]Thank you, Garfield.
[271:51.13]Icarus Gaming 250.
[271:52.53]We're almost at the end.
[271:53.61]Jerma, earlier this year, I broke up with my girlfriend of one and a half years of realizing I was gay.
[271:57.61]It was really isolating for me since I've been talking with her every day until that point.
[272:04.17]But your streams helped me cheer me up and keep company during it.
[272:08.50]You're a huge inspiration.
[272:10.36]The things you said in these post-stream chats got me to return to college and find my path.
[272:14.80]I'm now getting a degree in English.
[272:16.94]You're a big part of that.
[272:20.24]Good luck to you.
[272:22.91]Learn, learn, learn.
[272:25.85]Thank you, Icarus Gamers.
[272:30.70]For the 250.

[272:33.96]Good luck to you.
[272:37.44]Schaudenfroid.
[272:39.16]Thanks for the $5.
[272:39.66]I'm very new to the channel, but to say your streams have made my day are an understatement.
[272:44.66]Sometimes you're the only thing keeping me going, so I appreciate you being here.
[272:49.34]That's a really fucking huge, nice thing to say about somebody.
[272:52.98]Thank you, Troyden Frog.
[272:57.24]The Virtual Boy thanks for the 900 bits.
[272:59.42]Jerma, I seriously think you're one of the funniest dudes ever.
[273:02.10]That's debatable.
[273:03.16]I've been a huge fan for a long time.
[273:04.56]Love seeing you grow and evolve.
[273:05.62]You deserve every bit you've gotten, in my opinion.
[273:08.08]Thanks for all the laughs.
[273:10.70]It's a big statement.
[273:11.70]I'm fucking grounded to think that you think that.
[273:15.48]So thank you.
[273:17.50]Expendable, Gingy, thanks for the 1500 bits.

[273:33.41]Thank you, Expendable.
[273:34.39]Thanks for the 1500 fucking bits.
[273:36.03]Thanks for the huge money.

[273:39.87]Spooky, James Spooky, thanks for the $5.21.
[273:43.13]Thanks for being you.
[273:44.43]Always keep it real.
[273:47.84]I saw your channel linked in a star video nine years ago.
[273:52.56]Thank you, James Spooky.
[273:55.32]It is time for us to show the subs.
[273:58.94]Are you ready for this?
[274:02.88]This is going to be insane.
[274:06.50]This is going to be in-fucking-sane.
[274:09.88]Are you ready for the New Year subs?
[274:13.70]The 10,000 subs.

[275:04.91]Happy New Year, Germo.
[275:06.47]It's been a great six years knowing you.
[275:08.59]Sometimes I wish we could keep you a small channel forever.
[275:13.81]It's nice to have it small and comfy, but you seriously deserve all the best.
[275:17.53]Hope you grow even more.
[275:21.22]We'll see.
[275:21.96]I'm completely shocked that there's this many people here in the first place.
[275:26.84]Thank you, Snoozing.
[275:27.52]Thanks for being here.

[277:34.76]I've been here since the worm stream with Vinny.
[277:37.76]Jesus Christ.
[277:40.12]You've been a great entertainer for me, and I've been there bringing me laughs through my sobriety.
[277:45.18]Two and a half years sober now.
[277:47.10]Thanks to the streams.

[278:37.52]Don't ever forget that and rest in peace to Chicky.
[278:40.43]Absolutely.
[278:45.41]That's one of those things that I haven't really, like I said, I haven't talked about it at all.
[278:50.73]Because there was never a reason to.
[278:53.62]That's kind of a personal thing that there was no reason to talk about it.
[278:57.50]It was just kind of me and this person had a small just back and forth relationship where we hung out a few times.
[279:05.33]It wasn't necessary to talk about.
[279:12.01]Don't forget Kim.

[282:18.97]Jerma missed most of the stream, just coming in at the end to support my favorite streamer.
[282:22.64]I'm not good at expressing my feelings through text, so my bad if this sounds stilted.
[282:27.54]It does not.
[282:29.34]Thank you personally for being a good entertainer and for just an amazing person in general.
[282:34.22]You've had an amazing impact on my emotional health and my sense of humor.

[282:55.64]5,000 bits from Never Trust a Purple.
[282:58.56]German, it's been a long time.
[282:59.57]I've been watching.
[283:00.09]It feels like a lifetime.
[283:03.13]Words can't express the good you've done for me and everyone else.
[283:07.44]Thanks from the bottom of my heart for being such a positive force in our lives.
[283:09.96]You deserve every cent.
[283:12.70]I'm glad you think that.
[283:13.76]I hope you continue to think that as we go into 2020.
[283:16.36]Thank you for being here for 10 fucking years, Purple.
[283:20.46]And thanks for the $50.
[283:20.90]Erasmus, thanks for $250.
[283:24.77]Surferf, thanks for $5.
[283:25.39]Holy shit.
[283:31.82]Jeremy, me and my good friend have been watching since 2012.
[283:35.44]Always love the content.
[283:36.42]We quote you on the daily.
[283:39.66]250 from Jeannie.
[283:40.48]Boy, you're a genuinely funny guy, Jeremy.
[283:42.34]I'm usually serious and stone-faced around people.
[283:45.42]But after I met you in early 2017, and I watched you grab that Auto 5 vid and followed you on Twitch, I laughed more often as a famous actor once said, a day without laughter is a day wasted.
[284:00.29]I would say that's about that much how much you mean to me.
[284:03.93]Thank you from Chile.
[284:07.29]2020 is the year of the rat.
[284:09.27]Thank you.
[284:12.61]Garfield, thanks for the 250.
[284:15.55]Let's take another stroll down memory lane with Garf.
[284:17.43]Remember that time I single-handedly raised the bit minimum twice?
[284:20.96]Yes.
[284:21.86]It used to be 25 bits before Garf stepped in the picture.
[284:25.36]I bet some of you new subs don't even know about that one.
[284:28.82]I don't know if I'm allowed to do this, but since this is the last Garfield graph of the decade, I guess it was worth a shot.
[284:40.83]Garfield the Monday Killer is the reason why we have raised the minimum bits.
[284:44.71]Here you go.
[284:47.87]It used to be 100, actually, and then Garfield the Monday Killer came along and
[284:54.43]You know, gave 100 a lot, and we had to increase the bits because it was going too long.
[285:08.54]The Monday Killer strikes twice.
[285:10.64]Where is my keys?
[285:11.74]300 bits.
[285:12.86]Can I donate directly through Twitch?
[285:14.72]I don't have that available.
[285:16.53]Only through Twitch or subs, unfortunately.
[285:20.35]K. Deconor, thanks for the $5.
[285:22.77]German, I meant to give this to you for Christmas, but it's a bit late here.
[285:26.39]Holy fuck, this is awesome.
[285:30.30]How do I get this on stream immediately?
[285:37.34]Look at Otto.
[285:39.46]It's Otto.
[285:42.92]Thanks for everything.
[285:44.36]Thank you for this awesome fucking picture.
[285:47.96]Kim is going to love this.
[285:52.24]By the way, Kim and I did a DNA test on Otto.
[285:58.04]Because I didn't know what he was.
[286:00.50]We finally got the results back.
[286:03.48]He is 38% Dachshund.
[286:04.12]He is 38%.
[286:04.34]Something else.
[286:04.78]He is 10% Shetland Sheepdog.
[286:08.16]He is 10% Chihuahua.
[286:24.03]What do you think the 38% is?
[286:26.09]That's not Dachshund.
[286:28.81]It's ridiculous.
[286:29.99]I can't even make this up.
[286:35.55]Rat Terrier.
[286:42.35]Swear to God.
[286:44.53]I swear to fucking God.
[286:47.47]He is a Rat Terrier Dachshund.
[286:57.06]Only Otto would be Rat Terrier, right?
[287:00.57]It's crazy.
[287:03.03]Clockwork and thanks for the $5.
