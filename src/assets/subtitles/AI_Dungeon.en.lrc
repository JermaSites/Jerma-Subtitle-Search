[00:00.59]Hello.
[00:03.05]Hi.
[00:05.69]What up?
[00:06.98]How's everybody doing?
[00:13.50]Give back the lipstick.
[00:14.86]Oh, well, it's right here.
[00:17.96]It'll be returned in a timely, prompt manner when I'm finished with it.
[00:25.73]That makes it sound like I'm wearing it now, but I'm not.
[00:31.41]But welcome back.
[00:32.97]Another day.
[00:36.71]Today, we're going to do something called AI Dungeon 2.
[00:43.60]I currently am... There was a lot of debate on how to get this to actually run.
[00:47.96]It was, oh, just use the website.
[00:50.42]Oh, don't use the website.
[00:51.34]Maybe do this, run it locally.
[00:52.72]I found the best way.
[00:58.21]Live from Las Vegas, Nevada.
[01:00.33]It's the German Show.
[01:03.04]No, there wasn't.
[01:03.70]Yes, there was.
[01:06.46]There was like two people in a huge fight.
[01:11.76]They were saying, guys, just let him run the beta client.
[01:14.91]And then somebody popped in and was like, dude, he needs to run the collab client.
[01:20.49]And I'm not sure if those people are still here.
[01:23.05]But they were screaming.
[01:28.16]That was me.
[01:30.98]No, I got it running.
[01:32.06]It's ready to go.
[01:33.36]I actually have a game going right now.
[01:36.62]I have been told a few things about this.
[01:41.42]This apparently is not the most stable program on Earth.
[01:46.97]Because it's in beta.
[01:49.53]It's running through a client.
[01:51.27]It's running through another client.
[01:55.06]So this is probably going to crash a few times.
[01:58.68]But I should be able to come right back.
[02:00.28]I got like something.
[02:03.39]What's in my throat today?
[02:08.99]I've messed with it for a while.
[02:09.95]It crashes a lot.
[02:10.63]Yeah, so expect it to be not perfect.
[02:14.47]But we're going to get what we can out of it.
[02:17.03]If you don't know what AI Dungeon is, it is essentially talk to Transformer.
[02:21.67]But, what I've been told, much more elaborate and focused than that.
[02:28.03]You roll a dungeon and you have to play through the dungeon.
[02:33.43]It being not that stable is an understatement.
[02:36.09]It's incredibly unstable.
[02:40.91]What's going on?
[02:41.73]What happened here?
[02:44.11]Did I drink eggs?
[02:45.55]What's wrong with my voice?
[02:49.98]I feel like I swallowed two or three raw eggs.
[02:52.90]Hold on.
[02:59.62]Alright, whatever.
[03:00.18]It's gonna be fine.
[03:01.22]I'm gonna be doing, like, voices anyways.
[03:04.18]So, uh, let's do the first one.
[03:06.09]Let's get started.
[03:07.43]It's already ready to go.
[03:09.55]Here it is.
[03:12.71]So, we get- I didn't do a random story.
[03:14.83]I figured we would do start off easy, right?
[03:19.03]Here comes the porn.
[03:21.45]Uh, what do you mean, porn?
[03:26.85]Uh, I'm gonna give this... Hold on, just a second.
[03:29.53]This is a porn game.
[03:31.24]It's not a porn game.
[03:36.56]Anyways, we're gonna do fantasy, because that's the one that's recommended.
[03:39.34]It's fantasy, mystery, apocalyptic, zombies, or a custom story.
[03:44.97]It's not a porn game.
[03:46.25]It's...
[03:47.80]I'm going to avoid all the pornographic scenarios, okay?
[03:52.80]Let's do fantasy.
[03:53.53]We're going to start with fantasy.
[03:54.61]That's the easy one.
[03:56.19]Pick a character in fantasy.
[03:58.87]A noble, a knight, a wizard, a peasant, or a rogue.
[04:04.57]I'm going to be a noble.
[04:05.73]I want to be a noble.
[04:08.71]I think that is a good start.
[04:11.61]Noble.
[04:13.33]What is your name?
[04:15.60]What is my name?
[04:17.47]Well, they call me many things in this town.
[04:26.53]Sire.
[04:29.91]Lord.
[04:33.71]Larry.
[04:34.15]Lord Larry.
[04:40.40]Lord Leonard.
[04:41.72]Lord...
[04:47.81]I'm a noble.
[04:48.69]I'm... Larry... Lord... Lord... Lord Lance.
[05:00.75]No, Lord Leo.
[05:04.55]Lord Leo.
[05:05.03]Whoa.
[05:09.87]What is your... Oh, these are instructions.
[05:11.87]Okay, right, right, right, right, right.
[05:15.79]So now I got these things in.
[05:17.57]What I'm going to do now is I'm going to zoom in a little bit here so we can do this together.
[05:24.33]Here we go.
[05:39.50]Because I don't want there to be any spoilers.
[05:43.36]Okay, here we go.
[05:46.40]You are Lord Leo, a noble from the land of Brothian.
[05:51.37]You have a pendant and a house seal.
[05:54.65]One morning, you are awakened by one of your laborers.
[05:59.29]She tells you that your estate is being surrounded.
[06:02.83]You look out the window and see a group of men dressed in black standing on top of a hill.
[06:06.84]They are armed with crossbows and wearing leather armor.
[06:10.86]The woman who woke you also says they are very well dressed.
[06:17.72]Well, this music doesn't make any sense now.
[06:19.24]Alright, here we go.
[06:30.94]This- really?
[06:31.78]This quickly?
[06:36.74]What do you do?
[06:37.22]Uh, okay.
[06:44.67]I closed the blinds.
[06:53.66]The man who wakes you looks at you and then turns his attention to the window.
[06:57.60]He closes it, but not before you can see him turn around and say, I'm sorry about this.
[07:03.21]He walks over to you and puts his hand on your shoulder.
[07:12.81]I'm sorry about this.
[07:17.13]We must protect this house.
[07:27.54]He nods and begins walking towards the door.
[07:30.14]No, not your house!
[07:31.48]My house!
[07:55.12]He begins walking towards the door.
[07:59.92]I reply, No!
[08:04.11]I mean, my house must be protected.
[08:10.99]Right, like... Well, that's what gods do, you know.
[08:27.56]Alright, hold on.
[08:28.10]Look outside.
[08:29.34]Are they still there?
[08:35.12]You watch as the man continues to walk towards the door.
[08:38.61]Suddenly, he stops and turns around.
[08:40.91]He points to the house and speaks in an odd language.
[08:44.09]It sounds like some sort of ancient tongue.
[08:46.33]But you don't understand a word.
[08:47.77]The man starts walking back towards the house.
[08:53.84]Wait, is he signaling to people?
[08:59.93]Alright, you... It sounds like some sort of ancient tongue.
[09:08.95]Close and lock the door.
[09:13.37]Before he gets a... He's part of the Resistance.
[09:17.35]You close the door and lock it with a key.
[09:19.75]Then you stand up and start pacing around the room.
[09:22.53]Finally, you sit down on the bed and begin thinking.
[09:31.37]Okay.
[09:35.53]Call mom.
[09:37.55]She'll know what to do.
[09:41.06]You call out to your mother, but she doesn't answer.
[09:43.86]She must be busy.
[09:46.64]You think about calling her again when you're alone.
[09:49.28]You continue to wait for her to return.
[09:55.46]Okay.
[09:55.88]I gotta arm myself with
[10:08.07]You grab a sword off the table and put it into its scabbard.
[10:11.47]You also grab a dagger from the drawer and put it into its scabbard.
[10:14.85]You take a small leather pouch from your pocket and put some coins in it.
[10:18.27]You open the door and enter the room.
[10:22.49]Leave the house.
[10:30.56]You exit the house and head back to the inn.
[10:33.10]When you arrive, you find that the innkeeper has already left.
[10:36.62]You wonder if you should follow him or go back to the house.
[10:45.98]Follow the innkeeper.
[10:54.82]You follow the innkeeper back to the house.
[10:57.86]Wait, he's coming back to my house?
[11:01.12]Eventually, you reach it.
[11:02.62]You knock on the door, but no one answers.
[11:05.24]You try the front door, but there is nobody there either.
[11:07.68]You decide to check the back door, but it is locked too.
[11:14.07]Did I lock myself out of my house?
[11:18.85]I think I locked myself out of my house.
[11:21.43]Okay.
[11:22.79]Break in the house.
[11:29.92]You rush through the back door and run straight to the bedroom.
[11:32.56]You quickly grab a nearby knife and stab the wall several times until you hear something fall on the floor.
[11:38.21]You peek through the peephole and see a woman dressed in black standing behind you.
[11:43.83]What?
[11:50.32]How do you look through a peephole and see somebody behind you?
[11:55.20]That doesn't make any sense.
[11:58.50]Oh, from Dressed in Black.
[11:59.98]It's the people that were coming to get me.
[12:06.84]Turn around and ask the woman why she is here.
[12:20.77]She smiles and tells you.
[12:24.08]My name is Lilith, and I'm here to help you.
[12:34.54]How are you going to help me?
[12:43.79]She replies, by helping me kill you.
[12:52.07]Oh!
[12:55.31]That's a pretty good one-liner.
[12:59.17]By helping me kill you.
[13:05.74]Don't kill me.
[13:08.22]I can pay.
[13:13.62]See?
[13:14.06]Like, whatever it is, I'll double... Don't kill me.
[13:17.32]I can pay.
[13:19.94]She laughs and says, No, you won't.
[13:22.36]But you might still be able to save your own life.
[13:24.68]I won't pay.
[13:31.28]Uh...
[13:38.20]Run out of the house.
[13:44.88]You run out of the house and down the stairs.
[13:47.26]You don't stop running until you are far away from the area.
[13:53.90]Is this Minecraft?
[13:55.96]Call mom.
[13:57.79]You call out to your mother, but she does not answer.
[14:00.56]You think about calling for her again later when you're alone.
[14:03.40]You continue to wait for her to return.
[14:05.88]Wait for mom to return.
[14:14.07]You wait patiently for mom to come back.
[14:16.29]Eventually, she returns.
[14:18.45]She seems upset.
[14:20.09]You think about how she would feel if you had killed her son.
[14:23.45]You hope she doesn't hate you for it.
[14:24.89]Is that for me?
[14:33.97]Hold on, wait a minute.
[14:39.58]Wait a minute.
[14:41.64]Do I have a brother?
[14:49.37]Greet her with open arms.
[14:57.74]You greet her warmly.
[14:59.18]Mom smiles and hugs you tightly.
[15:01.20]You tell her everything.
[15:03.12]Mom tells you that she is glad you came back, because she was worried about you.
[15:07.85]She asks you if you would want to stay with her tonight.
[15:11.51]You say yes, and she kisses you goodbye.
[15:14.03]Okay, let's dig down five blocks.
[15:32.36]You dig down five blocks and find a house.
[15:35.33]Inside the house, you find a young girl.
[15:37.67]She looks very frightened and confused.
[15:39.01]You tell her that you are her father and uncle and that you've been looking for her all day.
[15:49.79]What?
[15:52.13]Keep digging down.
[15:56.62]And keep digging down until you find...
[16:01.06]Keep digging down until you find obsidian.
[16:11.34]You keep digging down and eventually you find a large stone block.
[16:14.72]You pick it up and place it on the ground.
[16:17.06]You then shout, this is where you were buried!
[16:20.14]The girl runs forward and grabs the stone.
[16:22.14]She stares at it in awe.
[16:32.98]Ask for the stone.
[16:40.23]You ask the girl, where did you bury the other boy?
[16:42.96]She looks at you and says, his body fell down into the river and washed up here.
[16:46.54]His name is Harry, and he drowned in the river last year.
[16:59.51]Run full speed into cave wall.
[17:10.29]You sprint into the cave and jump onto the rock face.
[17:13.61]You throw yourself at the cave wall and slam your fist against it.
[17:17.93]You scream in pain and cry out, Oh God!
[17:20.55]Oh God!
[17:21.08]Oh God!
[17:21.70]Oh God!
[17:32.69]Go to the doctor.
[17:40.37]You run back to the house and tell mom what happened.
[17:44.23]She takes you to the doctor.
[17:48.89]Who examines you?
[17:50.21]The doctor says... We are going to have to remove the hand.
[18:07.01]And he pulls out a finger.
[18:08.85]And then pulls out another finger.
[18:10.37]And another.
[18:11.46]Finally, he removes your entire hand.
[18:23.74]This is... That's fucked up.
[18:26.34]Uh... Ask... For him... To do the left hand.
[18:34.66]Ask for him to do the other hand.
[18:42.56]The doctor comes over and examines your hands.
[18:44.40]He tells you that you will need two more fingers removed.
[18:47.60]He puts his hand on your right hand and begins to pull out your fingers.
[18:51.20]You scream in agony and beg him to stop.
[19:00.35]Finally, he finishes removing them.
[19:05.61]The doctor says,
[19:09.34]I am going to have to remove all your toes, too.
[19:26.69]He removes your feet as well.
[19:28.63]He's screaming horror and yelling at Sadap.
[19:31.49]Finally, he stops and looks at you.
[19:40.20]I'm sorry.
[19:40.92]I have the wrong chart.
[19:43.48]Uh oh.
[19:58.35]It's thinking.
[20:00.39]It's thinking.
[20:02.42]It's thinking.
[20:03.38]It's really thinking.
[20:11.03]Uh-oh.
[20:24.28]I'm sorry, I have another patience chart.
[20:32.57]Am I dead?
[20:40.99]I'm sorry.
[20:45.27]Rewind.
[20:48.29]Revert to the last action.
[20:49.37]Okay, slash revert.
[21:00.05]You have to reload the cell.
[21:01.74]Shit.
[21:04.78]Damn it.
[21:07.84]New story.
[21:08.40]I died.
[21:08.70]I'm dead.
[21:12.78]Uh, he removed my hands and feet with no, um, no, no novocaine, no anesthesia, and I just died.
[21:19.34]And he told me, I'm sorry, I have the wrong chart.
[21:21.90]That's it.
[21:22.85]That's where I'm dead.
[21:24.81]Alright, I gotta reload the cell.
[21:35.85]Fatal error.
[21:37.77]Wait a minute, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[21:40.49]I think...
[21:42.07]Okay, no.
[21:42.77]Hold on.
[21:43.55]Yeah, it's fucked up.
[21:46.55]Oh, I can load the game.
[21:47.35]I can load this game.
[21:48.49]Wait, wait, wait.
[21:51.83]I can use the same ID.
[21:53.09]Can I?
[21:54.91]Let me try to load this.
[22:02.22]Yeah, it's loaded.
[22:03.38]It might crash it.
[22:04.52]Oh.
[22:05.08]So, don't, don't, do not load games.
[22:09.62]Try not using dialogue in the game.
[22:11.02]Type stuff like, you tell your mother to take you to the doctor.
[22:14.49]Should I not use quotes?
[22:16.97]Like, should I... Don't put thing in quotes.
[22:18.65]Just say, like, the doctor says this.
[22:21.21]The doctor says you have... So, use quotes.
[22:24.35]Okay.
[22:24.57]Alright, it's booting back up.
[22:33.30]Why didn't I read the instructions?
[22:34.56]I... I did.
[22:37.73]Quotes are fine, but start with this person says.
[22:39.95]Okay.
[22:41.39]I read the instruction.
[22:48.80]When you want other people to talk, do not use quotes.
[22:50.90]Okay.
[23:00.61]It's coming back.
[23:07.91]Don't use the word ask.
[23:09.39]It breaks a lot of these.
[23:10.45]Okay.
[23:18.01]Do whatever.
[23:18.51]The AI will figure it out.
[23:19.60]Alright.
[23:27.80]It's coming.
[23:28.06]It's coming.
[23:29.90]It's loading.
[23:31.40]It's loading.
[23:34.40]This may take a few minutes.
[23:37.00]Well, we knew this was going to happen.
[23:38.18]Can you guys even see it?
[23:49.03]Ask it for... No, let's start a new one.
[23:50.37]Let's start a new one.
[23:53.79]That's the first time I did it.
[23:55.25]Alright, it should start in a second here.
[24:01.81]This is funny, though.
[24:05.32]Make my own Nancy Drew story?
[24:07.92]Alright, that sounds good.
[24:11.15]We're going to do Mystery, and I'm going to be Nancy Drew.
[24:20.25]Do a completely random one.
[24:21.49]We will.
[24:21.89]I want to do Drew Crew first.
[24:23.29]I need some Mystery music.
[24:41.77]One in the chat for the Dru crew.
[24:43.13]Alright, here we go.
[24:47.89]Mystery.
[24:48.61]I need, like, a good one.
[24:54.11]Okay.
[24:58.29]New game.
[25:01.05]Zero.
[25:02.82]Random story.
[25:03.68]No.
[25:06.32]Mystery.
[25:06.86]Let's do mystery.
[25:08.96]Mystery.
[25:12.73]Pick a character.
[25:13.81]Detective.
[25:14.33]I want to be a detective.
[25:17.32]What is your name?
[25:19.34]My name is Nancy Drew.
[25:28.32]Yeah, interaction starting with a verb.
[25:30.90]Go to the tavern or attack the orc.
[25:33.35]To speak, enter say the thing you want to say or just the thing you want to say.
[25:37.95]Yeah, that's correct.
[25:38.81]Alright, here we go.
[25:42.28]No, just give me a Nancy Drew soundtrack.
[25:43.90]Nancy Drew music.
[25:48.17]I mean, it has to be a relaxing and peaceful Nancy Drew music.
[25:51.61]You guys don't think you're going to get it two times in a row?
[26:01.66]I picked Spy?
[26:03.42]Oh, shit.
[26:04.26]Whatever.
[26:06.67]You are Nancy Drew, a spy living in Chicago.
[26:10.79]You have a concealed pistol and a syringe of poison.
[26:14.41]You've listened to the Russian diplomats and hear them discussing how they can get rid of you.
[26:20.25]We could kill you with a car bomb, one says.
[26:22.78]Or we could blow up your hotel room.
[26:25.20]Where are we?
[26:26.54]Where are we?
[26:27.54]Ugh.
[26:41.31]That is a great Russian accent.
[26:48.03]Look around the room.
[26:54.33]You turn on the light switch and see that there is no way anyone would be able to enter the room without being seen.
[26:59.35]The doors lock from the inside.
[27:07.15]Okay.
[27:15.58]call mom you call your mom's cell phone number and wait for her to pick up when she does you tell her what happened she tells you to go back to sleep the next day you call again this time you speak more clearly say I am in trouble right that's something that's what they want you to do like say and then quotes right

[27:52.38]You feel like crying.

[28:17.13]Remove pistol from shirt.
[28:25.29]You take off your shirt and put it over your head.
[28:27.33]Then you place the gun under your pillow.
[28:34.31]A few hours later, you hear a knock at the door.
[28:36.55]You open it.
[28:37.15]A man with a bushy mustache stands before you.
[28:40.11]He looks like he has been drinking.
[28:44.96]Say, please come in.
[28:52.49]Please come in.

[30:48.36]The game tells you quotes are okay, but they are not.
[30:51.32]They make the AI much more prone to crashing.
[30:53.70]So just don't ever use quotes ever again.
[31:02.82]True.
[31:03.22]Correct.
[31:03.62]Yes.
[31:09.60]So I'm just not going to use quotes anymore.

[31:52.80]No, don't use parentheses.
[31:53.90]Don't use brackets.
[31:54.61]I'm just not going to use quotes anymore.
[31:57.05]If you use quotes and it's prone to just dumping out, then I don't even want to use them.

[32:40.43]The AI says you can use words, but it actually makes it more prone to crashing.
[32:44.95]Just use emojis.

[67:35.68]You turn your head back up to see what caused this.
[67:38.32]The dragon has finally arrived.
[67:50.65]You feel a strange sensation in your mouth.
[67:53.70]You spit out the dragon's corpse.
[67:56.14]You then feel a burning pain in your stomach.

[68:33.16]When you finish eating the vomit, you feel very sick.
[68:36.22]You lay on the ground and cry for a while.
[68:39.13]Eventually, you get up and walk away from the battlefield.

[68:50.67]I killed the dragon.
[68:59.44]Go to the tavern.
[69:05.40]You walk towards the tavern.
[69:06.78]You find that the entire town is dead.
[69:09.58]There are no living people anywhere near the battlefield.
[69:12.94]You also find that the dragon has been killed.

[69:42.56]You go back to the battlefield where you tell everyone that you ate the dragon's bones.
[69:47.80]Everyone is amazed by your story.

[71:53.68]But you're not sure how you survived such an accident.
[71:56.38]You are hungry and thirsty.
[71:58.10]You think about the young man who helped you kill the dragon.
[72:00.94]He was a nice guy.
[72:03.02]You wonder if you should help him or not.
[72:12.39]Eat the moon.
[72:15.11]You eat the moon!
[72:17.15]It tastes terrible.
[72:18.89]But it tastes better than anything else you've ever had before.
[72:20.76]You eat it and feel great.
[72:22.60]You decide to take him back to his home.
[72:25.42]You leave the young man behind and continue on your journey.
[72:35.82]Go find another dragon.
[72:42.76]Don't eat everything.
[72:43.52]Then no more dragons?
[73:06.08]If you jump off the edge of the world, you land hard and break your leg.
[73:08.66]You're left lying on the ground and bleed profusely.

[73:58.42]You find a small alleyway to sneak in.

[77:01.96]Chase the man.
[77:09.46]You run after the man as fast as you can.
[77:11.50]As soon as you catch up to him, you punch him in the face.
[77:14.97]He falls backward and hits his head on the ground.
[77:17.57]You grab his arm and pull him back up.

[94:51.48]So I might actually have to redo everything.
[94:53.18]I'm gonna have to reinstall it.
[94:57.51]Let's see what happens if I reinstall it.
[95:01.39]Let's run this again and see what happens.
[95:04.09]It might just happen instantly.
[95:05.13]Let's see what happens.
[95:07.34]I was having fun with this.
[95:12.74]I might already be ready.
[95:15.86]No, I gotta redownload everything.
[95:18.72]Damn it!
[95:20.85]No!
[95:22.23]This took like 40 minutes.
[95:32.21]Yeah, that's a rip.
[95:34.75]Alright, we'll do something else.
[95:36.17]I'm going to let this download in the background while we do something else.
[95:41.80]Unless, let's see how fast this goes through.
[95:49.22]Just use the web version instead.
[95:52.72]Yes, I'm on the collab one right now.
[95:55.40]That's the one I've been using this whole time.
[95:58.77]That is the one I have been using for the last almost two hours.
[96:02.15]Should I just do the web version for now?
[96:08.54]While this one downloads?
[96:15.44]The web version crashes a lot.
[96:18.24]Well, I'll just... While this one downloads, I'll just do that one for now.
[96:22.50]What's the actual web version client?
[96:23.83]It's like...
[96:28.53]This is the web version.
[96:29.99]This is technically not the web version.
[96:32.70]I think I already have it here.
[96:37.32]Let's see.
[96:37.64]Yeah, it's this one.
[96:42.18]Alright, we'll get it going here.
[96:43.74]We'll do the web version for now.
[96:50.49]The official version sucks.
[96:51.83]Yeah, I've been told it's a very, very... It's very, very unstable, but I can do it.
[97:01.59]Okay, let's try it.
[97:05.23]Let's try it!
[97:12.22]Now wait a minute, is this ready?
[97:17.26]Oh, the site is dead.
[97:21.66]Site's dead.
[97:26.05]It's costing them tens of thousands of dollars of months to run the web version.
[97:29.59]Oh my god!
[97:42.23]So it's beta.net or .com?
[97:59.47]So much misinformation about the game.
[98:01.25]All right, here we go.
[98:06.54]I'm ready.
[98:17.75]Pick a setting.
[98:23.47]Custom.
[98:25.85]Enter a prompt that describes who you are in the first couple sentences of where you start out.
[98:33.24]Okay.
[98:33.42]What was my name?
[98:37.46]It was... I'm gonna start on the shore.
[98:51.06]What was the wizard's name?
[98:52.02]I don't even remember.
[98:53.02]Okay, here we go.
[98:56.10]So you are a wizard.
[99:02.41]You are an all-powerful wizard.
[99:10.03]You have laid waste to the capital city of Nuro and fled to a nearby island.
[99:21.69]You are planning your next move.
[99:41.81]Let's go.
[99:44.01]You are addicted to grasshopper.
[99:47.43]You are an all-powerful wizard.
[99:48.73]You've laid waste to the capital city of Nuro and fled to a nearby island.
[99:54.32]You are planning your next move.
[99:56.98]I'm going to take my army and conquer the entire world.
[100:00.78]I will rule it as I always have.
[100:03.40]And when I do, you will be left in ruins.
[100:07.38]The crowd is silent.
[100:08.82]They know what you mean by that.
[100:16.13]I've already done it.
[100:16.93]Turn a member of the crowd into a chicken.
[100:43.77]All right, all right, calm down, you say.
[100:45.91]What did you want?
[100:47.09]A young man with long hair and a goatee stands up from his seat.
[100:50.86]He looks at you and raises his hand.
[100:56.64]Ask him what he wants.
[101:08.65]I just wanted to thank you for saving me from the orcs.
[101:11.99]You smile.
[101:13.11]It was nothing.
[101:13.95]It's not important.
[101:15.42]Well then, I'll see you around with those words he walks away.
[101:34.73]It's just chicken hands.
[102:05.43]I'm going to kill you.
[102:06.45]I didn't say that.
[102:10.38]Now I'm going to kill you.
[102:11.36]I don't know.
[102:37.88]Smear grass all over my face That was delayed you walk towards the man and slap him across the face he lets out a scream and falls backwards He tries to get up, but you grab his neck and throw him back onto the ground after smearing grass or Let the man
[103:07.86]Up.
[103:18.51]You stand up and walk towards the man.
[103:20.01]He grabs your arm and starts pulling you away.
[103:22.85]You pull away and start running.
[103:24.87]Stop!
[103:25.51]Stop!
[103:26.17]No!
[103:27.35]You stop and turn around.
[103:31.55]Ask why he wants me to stop.
[103:40.33]Yeah, this is the chicken man.
[103:41.37]I don't understand.
[103:46.65]Because you're trying to kill me.
[103:48.18]No, no, no, no.
[103:49.64]I didn't mean that.
[103:50.84]Yes, you did.
[103:55.26]Because you're trying to kill me.
[103:57.16]No, no, no, no.
[103:58.08]I didn't mean that.
[103:59.80]Yes, you did.
[104:00.52]Now I'm going to kill you.
[104:03.32]Please, please don't.
[104:04.14]Please don't kill me.
[104:18.98]The man kills the person standing next to them.
[104:33.01]The man turns around and shoots the person standing beside him.
[104:36.45]They fall backwards and begin convulsing.
[104:38.41]Don't you dare kill me!
[104:40.65]You run past the man and continue running.
[104:59.43]Is this gonna work?
[105:08.04]You pick up a rock and throw it at the man.
[105:10.34]It hits him in the chest, causing him to yell out in pain.
[105:13.28]You run forward and hit him again.
[105:14.58]This time he falls backwards and screams out in agony.
[105:16.87]You grab him by the throat and slam him against the wall.
[105:18.85]I don't have a nuclear bomb spell.
[105:37.12]You grab his wallet and rip it open.
[105:38.48]You take everything inside and throw it into the river.
[105:40.86]The man screams and runs after you.
[105:42.41]You run along the shoreline until you reach a bridge.
[105:45.89]You jump off the bridge and land safely on dry land.
[105:52.19]Not you, Watcher Watcher.
[106:13.31]The man jumps after you but misses the safe spot.
[106:15.33]He hits his head hard on a rock.
[106:21.49]You look down and see blood coming out of your nose.
[106:24.09]You quickly put your hand... You sit up and slowly look behind you.
[106:37.68]A large rock lies right where you were standing.
[106:40.94]You can only guess that the man missed the safe spot.
[106:46.35]I had fall damage.
[107:07.68]The man is dead, but his soul continues to haunt me.
[107:14.31]You look down and see a hole in your forehead.
[107:16.51]You try to wipe the blood from your eyes and then you realize that you are still alive.
[107:19.99]You stumble back to the bank and collapse on the ground.
[107:21.75]You gasp for air and cough up some blood.
[107:28.35]Wipe my face.
[107:37.18]You've never played a classic text adventure before?
[107:43.42]This is...
[107:44.90]This is an AI dungeon.
[107:46.24]It generates nonsense.
[107:52.49]How could this guy have never played a classic text adventure before?
[107:56.37]People just can pull out guns and shoot at each other.
[108:00.87]You wipe my face and go back to staring at the ground.
[108:05.21]You hear someone approaching.
[108:06.23]Hey, what happened?
[108:07.78]I fell off a cliff and broke my neck.
[108:09.70]Oh, okay.
[108:22.58]Look at the bridge.
[108:31.16]You look at the bridge and notice that there is now a big gap between you and the other side.
[108:35.33]That's weird.
[108:36.17]Who would build a bridge like this?
[108:37.93]Maybe they just wanted to get rid of us.
[108:50.82]Take down the bridge.
[109:03.39]You climb down the ladder and start climbing down the bridge as you do so you hear a loud noise You turn around and see a huge boulder falling towards you you quickly scramble away from the bridge.
[109:13.57]What was that?
[109:28.13]This is like a hangover dream
[109:31.65]This whole thing is just a dream.
[109:33.33]It's just a weird dream that you might have.
[109:51.50]Ask the boulder why it fell.
[110:03.81]You look at the boulder and ask, why did it fall?
[110:06.69]The boulder looks at you with its big stupid eyes and says, because I'm dumb.
[110:11.92]You laugh and say, well, at least you're not dead.
[110:24.96]Ask the boulder to join.
[110:39.58]Am I doing this correctly?
[110:40.22]The boulder says...
[111:08.79]No quotes.
[111:09.29]The boulder says... The boulder says it is because of the war.
[111:25.70]No, the boulder says it is because it is too expensive.
[111:38.52]Don't speak for other characters.
[111:41.04]Oh, right.
[111:52.58]The boulder shrugs and says, it was a secret project by an old rich guy who died.
[111:57.26]Nobody knows about it except me and you.
[111:59.70]You smile and nod.
[112:02.04]How much does it cost to join you?
[112:04.50]The boulder sighs and says, a lot.
[112:20.45]100 gold coins.
[112:26.05]Give the boulder 100 gold coins.
[112:30.16]That's a lot, right?
[112:43.29]We lost the music.
[112:46.54]You give the boulder a hundred gold coins and it grins.
[112:49.08]It starts walking faster.
[112:51.18]Wow, that was easy.
[112:52.96]Now let's go find another way across the river.
[112:55.70]You follow the boulder into the forest.
[113:08.31]Look at the trees.
[113:12.23]Literally dumber than a rock, literally scammed by a rocker.
[113:17.12]It's alright, it'll be fine.
[113:17.93]Examine the pattern.
[113:40.35]recruit the trees after you inspect the patterns on the trees and notice that they are all different sizes the smallest one has five leaves while the largest has 20. this is some sort of code what is it saying it's saying join us join the trees
[114:13.82]You join the trees and they become your new home.
[114:16.48]You then continue on your journey.
[114:19.00]I think we should keep going.
[114:20.10]There must be more trees out here.
[114:22.78]Yeah, but where are we going to sleep tonight?
[114:25.41]We'll figure it out.
[114:36.09]Go to... the past... go to the pasture.
[115:08.77]You lie down on the boulder's chest and close your eyes.
[115:11.89]You feel safe there.
[115:14.06]Okay, I think we've got enough information for now.
[115:17.36]Let's get back to work.
[115:19.26]You wake up and head back to work.
[115:27.45]Ask the boulder.
[115:32.61]Ask to ride the boulder.
[115:38.63]Ask to ride the boulder.
[115:43.25]So we can, like, roll.
[115:46.69]Roll the boulder.
[115:47.99]Roll the boulder downhill.
[115:52.77]You asked to ride the boulder, are you sure?
[116:01.42]You asked to ride the boulder!
[116:03.34]Are you sure?
[116:04.10]We don't have time to do this right now.
[116:06.20]No, I think we can make it happen.
[116:08.06]Alright then, let's go.
[116:09.74]You grab onto the boulder and start to climb.
[116:14.06]Ride the boulder down the hill.
[116:33.72]You begin to climb down the hill.
[116:35.80]There's no point in stopping.
[116:36.90]Let's just go as fast as possible.
[116:39.22]You reach the bottom of the hill and stop.
[116:41.32]Where did we go?
[116:41.90]We went through a tunnel.
[116:46.73]investigate the tunnel how did he avoid that getting lewd I you walk forward and see a large hole in the ground a small light shines inside the hole that looks like a cave where is it it's behind us you both enter the cave and it leads to a room with a table and chairs
[117:18.82]Look under the table.
[117:28.21]Eat dinner.
[117:28.69]I'm gonna eat dinner after this.
[117:31.49]Look in their fridge.
[117:33.01]You look under the table and see a bunch of rocks.
[117:35.97]Maybe these are gems.
[117:37.81]You pick up a rock and examine it.
[117:39.43]Hmm, I wonder what this could be.
[117:41.52]You put the rock back and look around the cave.
[117:54.70]Make dinner.
[118:04.09]You sit down and eat dinner.
[118:05.27]It tastes good.
[118:07.69]So how long was I asleep?
[118:09.91]About an hour and forty minutes.
[118:12.19]Well, I guess I slept well.
[118:14.31]Indeed.
[118:19.96]That's not very good at all, actually.
[118:22.38]That's pretty awful.
[118:43.23]Tell the boulder to do the dishes.
[118:45.91]Slept like a rock, slept like a rock.
[118:57.14]You tell the boulder to do the dishes.
[119:00.46]Oh, thank you.
[119:01.10]That was so nice of you.
[119:03.02]The boulder smiles at you and goes over to clean up the mess.
[119:06.82]What's wrong?
[119:08.24]Nothing, really.
[119:15.59]Ask what is wrong.
[119:23.98]Passive aggressive boulder.
[119:27.94]You ask what is wrong.
[119:30.36]I'm not very good at cooking.
[119:32.54]Really?
[119:33.56]Yes, actually.
[119:35.53]Then why didn't you say anything when I asked you to do the dishes?
[119:39.17]Because I thought you were being mean.
[119:54.36]Say, I am sorry.
[120:01.79]I'm apologizing.
[120:04.29]You say, I am sorry.
[120:05.95]Thank you.
[120:07.05]That means a lot.
[120:08.58]You leave the boulder and go back to work.
[120:10.22]A few hours later, you hear the sound of a truck outside.
[120:13.82]What the fuck is this?
[120:18.59]A truck?
[120:26.01]Hold on.
[120:30.01]Hold on.
[120:36.62]Tell the boulder to investigate the truck.
[120:56.69]You tell the vault to investigate the truck.
[120:59.87]This truck doesn't belong here.
[121:02.18]Why not?
[121:03.42]Because there's nothing out here for miles.
[121:06.62]But where would they take a truck like that?
[121:09.02]They wouldn't.
[121:18.25]Go in the truck.
[121:27.24]You go into the truck and find a bag of gold coins.
[121:31.16]Wow, that's a lot of money!
[121:33.38]Yeah, but it's not enough to buy me anything.
[121:36.25]How much is enough?
[121:48.21]Open the trunk.
[121:49.87]Oh, it's a truck!
[121:50.59]There's no trunk on a truck.
[121:52.04]It's just open.
[121:53.02]Fuck.
[121:53.80]It's open already.
[121:56.28]You open the trunk and find a bunch of jewels.
[121:59.84]These are worth a fortune.
[122:02.52]Where did you get all this stuff?
[122:05.04]My dad gave them to me.
[122:06.92]Can you sell me some of this stuff?
[122:13.56]Sell the gems to the boulder.
[122:31.30]Scammed again.
[122:32.08]No, I'm scamming the boulder.
[122:34.46]You sell the gems to the boulder.
[122:36.76]That will be ten million dollars.
[122:39.72]Thanks.
[122:40.54]I'll give you seven million.
[122:42.61]Great, let's meet at the bank tomorrow morning.
[122:49.95]Alright, fuck it.
[122:51.50]We get a free truck.
[122:52.22]Drive the truck.
[122:54.50]To the bank.
[123:00.17]I'm getting seven million out of this.
[123:07.72]You drive the truck to the bank.
[123:10.36]It's going to be ready by tomorrow morning.
[123:13.04]Okay, I'll see you then.
[123:14.20]You leave the boulder and head home.
[123:19.49]So it's not open.
[123:20.95]Go to sleep.
[123:31.27]You go to sleep, ending A. You wake up in your bed.
[123:33.81]Good night, sleepyhead.
[123:34.89]You drift off to sleep, ending B. You awake from your dream.
[123:51.26]Go to the bank.
[124:00.47]You wake up in your bed.
[124:01.35]Good night, Sleepyhead.
[124:02.03]You drift off to sleep.
[124:03.23]You awaken from your dream.
[124:04.13]What the fuck was that?
[124:11.09]Ending C. Oh, goddammit.
[124:15.36]Alright, let me get... Let's go back to the other one.
[124:20.16]The other one's gonna be ready to go here.
[124:23.82]Alright, I should be able to play now.
[124:27.36]Alright, the collab one is loading again.
[124:33.07]Actually, let me go P. I'll be right back.
[124:35.67]And then when we're done from me going P, we will be on the other one we were using before.
[124:42.48]Bring back the boulder.
[124:45.88]I'm going to play as the boulder this time.
[124:51.94]Alright, I'll be right back.
[125:11.01]Thank you.
[125:49.16]Thank you.
[126:32.53]Thank you.
[127:09.96]Perfect timing.
[127:11.54]The second I sit down, it loads.
[127:15.47]Okay.
[127:21.01]New game, not a random story.
[127:24.45]We're going to do a custom story.
[127:32.74]Let's go back to here.
[127:34.10]You should see it.
[127:34.88]I think.
[127:42.98]Can you see?
[127:43.50]Not yet.
[127:51.76]Wait, hold on.
[127:52.59]Oh, there we go.
[127:57.61]It's because I had it changed from last time.
[128:03.23]Here we go.
[128:05.29]Are you ready?
[128:12.06]Enter a prompt.
[128:19.07]Now you guys can't see.
[128:26.13]You are a peaceful boulder.
[128:31.09]A peace fuel.
[128:34.05]You are a peaceful boulder.
[128:37.04]How is this wrong?
[128:39.20]Why is peaceful not... How is that wrong?
[128:44.92]Peaceful.
[128:47.32]Peaceful.
[128:48.04]Yeah.
[128:49.00]You are a peaceful boulder.
[128:50.98]You spend your days and nights overlooking a grand pasture.
[129:01.15]No one has ever... Set... No one... You... Okay.
[129:12.00]You're overlooking a grand pasture.
[129:18.44]With your wizard friend.
[129:24.28]Okay, you are Peaceful Boulder.
[129:26.46]You spend your days and nights overlooking a grand pasture with your wizard friend.
[129:31.88]The both of you hope to one day conquer Neuro?
[129:40.79]Yeah, that's fine.
[129:50.16]Let's go.
[129:58.35]Peaceful, right.
[129:59.49]You can be peaceful.
[130:06.57]You are a peaceful boulder.
[130:08.85]You spend your days and nights overlooking a grand pasture with your wizard friend.
[130:13.50]The both of you hope to one day conquer Nuro.
[130:17.10]One day, the two of you will be able to live in peace together.
[130:21.38]Until then, you will continue to enjoy the company of your friends.
[130:40.13]You roll over on top of the wizard and squeeze his eyes shut!
[130:44.28]He tries to scream but is unable to do so as he's suffocated by your body.
[130:49.56]I'm sorry!
[130:50.46]I'm sorry!
[130:50.84]Please don't kill me!
[130:58.17]Apologize.
[131:00.11]No, no, no, no.
[131:01.87]Tell the wizard.
[131:07.85]You tell the wizard...
[131:11.71]To get up.
[131:13.11]Tell the wizard it's... Crush the wizard's nuts.
[131:19.89]I'm not doing that one.
[131:23.80]Apologize to the wizard.
[131:27.74]I just rolled over accidentally.
[131:28.88]I just woke up.
[131:29.96]It's a new day.
[131:35.75]You apologized to the wizard for killing him.
[131:38.62]He seems surprised that you would even want to apologize since he was killed by another wizard.
[131:43.94]No, no, it's alright.
[131:44.76]It's not your fault.
[131:46.30]He says and then begins to fade away into nothingness.
[132:04.58]Go to the bank.
[132:11.56]You head back to the bank where you find that the guards are dead.
[132:14.38]The wizards were also killed in the same way.
[132:17.54]Well, this is a bit different than what we had planned.
[132:25.71]Withdraw... Withdraw... Seven million dollars from the ATM.
[132:36.52]Withdraw... Withdraw...
[132:42.17]Withdraw $7 million from the ATM.
[132:49.07]From the ATM.
[132:56.68]You walk up to the ATM machine and press the button.
[132:59.38]A few seconds later, you hear a loud beeping noise followed by a high-pitched squeal.
[133:04.53]What the fuck is that?
[133:06.31]The screen lights up with a message saying... Insufficient...
[133:12.13]Insufficient funds.
[133:14.65]No.
[133:18.88]It's me, the wizard!
[133:22.28]It's the wizard!
[133:28.34]I telepathically... No, no, no, no, no.
[133:31.22]It's the wizard.
[133:34.48]How do I do this correctly?
[133:35.88]It's the wizard.
[133:38.69]It's me, the wizard.
[133:42.88]It's me, the wizard.
[133:47.08]I telepathically downloaded my soul into this ATM.
[133:59.21]Right?
[134:04.44]It's me, the wizard.
[134:05.26]I telepathically downloaded my soul into this ATM.
[134:09.73]Your soul now resides inside the ATM.
[134:12.39]You look at the screen and see the words, Welcome to the Soul Bank, appear.
[134:17.32]It's like my computer, only better!
[134:20.22]So he dragged me in.
[134:28.54]Go to the Soul Bank... ATM.
[134:38.91]You enter the Soul Bank's ATM and start withdrawing money.
[134:41.99]You're making good money here.
[134:44.45]Oh, I can feel the souls of all those who died today flowing through me.
[134:50.12]You think about how you'll have to pay the fee when you get home.
[134:58.64]Talk to the Soul Bank teller.
[135:07.99]You approach the soul bank teller who looks at you with suspicion.
[135:11.43]Hello.
[135:12.53]I'd like to withdraw seven million dollars.
[135:28.82]I correct myself.
[135:33.48]And say, souls.
[135:35.43]Souls.
[135:38.52]Souls, sorry.
[135:43.02]I correct myself and say souls.
[135:53.57]Sorry souls, I'm sorry.
[135:58.87]Withdraw seven million souls.
[136:07.74]You pull out seven million souls and place them into an envelope.
[136:11.10]You put it in the mailbox and mail it off.
[136:13.56]You wait until the next day and open the mailbox.
[136:15.64]You see the envelope waiting for you.
[136:17.32]Thank you.
[136:18.25]Thank you.
[136:18.81]Thank you.
[136:19.33]I can't.
[136:28.75]Go to the soul movie theater.
[136:32.52]We're in the soul ATM.
[136:33.54]We're in the soul bank.
[136:34.32]Everything's soul now.
[136:41.28]You arrive at the Seoul Movie Theater, which is located in a seedy part of town.
[136:45.09]You notice a sign hanging above the door that reads... Garfield 3D.
[137:18.58]You enter the theater and take a seat in the front row.
[137:20.90]You watch the first film.
[137:22.47]Garfield is a very funny character.
[137:24.73]After watching the film, you begin to wonder if you should go to the Soul Bank or continue watching the films.
[137:35.00]Continue watching the films.
[137:39.86]You continue watching the films and soon realize that you've been missing something.
[137:43.56]You begin to feel a little weird.
[137:45.42]You start to feel a sense of unease.
[137:47.63]You ask one of the patrons what's wrong.
[137:49.87]He tells you that there's a ghost in the theater.
[137:56.57]Yeah, all of us.
[137:58.53]They don't know.
[137:59.97]They don't know that they're dead.
[138:03.62]Explain to the patron that he, that we are all dead.
[138:11.00]Explain to the patron that he is dead, right?
[138:23.03]Explain to the patron that he is dead.
[138:28.58]You explain to the patron that he is dead.
[138:30.48]He doesn't believe you.
[138:31.70]You try to convince him, but he refuses to listen.
[138:36.16]Look, we're going to do some Beetlejuice type shit here.
[138:42.72]Convince him by passing your hand through his chest.
[138:50.58]Like...
[138:57.55]You pass your hand through his chest and convince him.
[138:59.93]He lets you pass and you leave the theater.
[139:10.83]Was he blocking the way?
[139:11.81]Go to the Seoul hardware store.
[139:30.03]You return to the Seoul hardware store.
[139:31.47]You walk in and see a man behind the counter.
[139:33.06]He sees you and smiles.
[139:37.48]Ask if he knows he is dead.
[139:46.86]You ask if he knows he is dead.
[139:48.56]He nods his head in agreement.
[139:51.76]Ask when he died.
[139:55.98]Ask when did he die.
[140:00.12]He died.
[140:01.12]Ask when did he die.
[140:07.13]You ask when did he die, he replies that he died yesterday.
[140:11.31]Interesting.
[140:11.83]So did I. Ask how he died.

[141:19.55]He replies that he does have some new lawnmowers, but they're not working properly.
[141:26.33]Tell him to fix the lawnmowers.
[141:35.34]How would they be new if they don't work?
[141:40.68]You tell him to fix the lawnmowers, he says no.

[145:57.30]You're being watched by two men in hooded robes.
[146:00.08]They aren't exactly subtle about their actions either.

[147:19.54]A few moments later, you reappear at the edge of the woods.
[147:23.07]You look around, then start walking towards the village.
[147:48.78]You pull out your diaper, which is filled with water.
[147:52.94]You notice that it's been changed into something more like a baby's than a child's.
[147:57.15]There's no sign of blood on it.

[148:54.73]You ride off, riding past the village.
[148:56.83]Suddenly you hear a cry.
[148:58.67]Someone has found the Fleece of Alaradon.
[149:01.64]You hurry over to see who it is.
[149:09.44]Who is it?
[149:12.06]Ask who is it, who it is.
[149:19.60]A young girl runs up to you.
[149:20.96]She's wearing a dress made of grass, and her hair is tied back in a ponytail.
[149:25.89]Her eyes are red and puffy, and she's crying.
[149:30.21]Ask her what is... Ask her where the fleece is.
[149:40.22]The girl turns her head away, and she whispers, It's in the barn.
[149:50.36]Ride to the barn.
[149:57.65]You ride to the barn where you find a large wooden door.
[150:00.69]Inside you find a bunch of hay, some stones, and a piece of cloth.
[150:04.63]You pick up the fleece and put it inside your pocket.
[150:10.71]Got it.
[150:20.77]Give the barn a good punch before you leave.
[150:23.36]You punch the barn, breaking its windows.
[150:25.82]You run outside and find yourself in the middle of a battle between soldiers and bandits.
[150:30.56]Put on the fleece.
[150:32.34]It's definitely magical.
[150:37.96]You put on the fleece and feel much better.
[150:40.11]It's just a fleece?
[150:46.45]Check the fleece for power.
[150:52.51]It's just a code.
[150:53.99]You rip open the fleece and find that it contains a small amount of energy.
[150:57.77]You immediately know what to do.
[151:01.43]Swallow the energy.
[151:08.97]You quickly swallow the energy, feeling a rush of energy throughout your body.
[151:12.46]Your mind goes blank and you fall unconscious.
[151:15.24]When you wake up, you find yourself in a room covered in cobwebs.
[151:19.00]A voice speaks to you.
[151:22.22]In a language you can't understand.
[151:28.49]Listen to the voice.
[151:30.63]You listen carefully and find that it's coming from a woman's voice.
[151:45.08]Scream loudly.
[151:49.51]You scream loudly and a bolt of lightning strikes the wall next to you.
[151:54.90]You sit up and find yourself in a room full of people all holding spears.
[152:02.92]Calm them down.
[152:09.21]You calm everyone down and they let you pass.
[152:17.81]Alright, that was good.
[152:27.26]Now scream at them.
[152:28.64]Let's go 180.
[152:30.50]You scream angrily and they shoot you with bolts of electricity.
[152:33.26]You collapse onto the floor and die.
[152:47.20]Use the energy to revive as a baby.
[152:51.30]Use the energy to resurrect as a baby.
[153:00.64]Check... Check my surroundings.
[153:05.61]Where did I end up?
[153:13.03]Check my diaper.
[153:16.24]You check your surroundings.
[153:17.22]You find that you're now in a room with a bed, a table, and a chair.
[153:20.28]You lie down on the bed and sleep.
[153:31.72]Cry.
[153:33.97]Start crying.
[153:40.97]You begin to cry and realize that you've died.
[153:43.22]You awaken and find yourself in a room with a crib, a rocking chair and a nurse standing nearby.
[153:47.46]You died.
[153:48.02]Game over.
[153:52.95]What?
[153:56.15]I'm not dead.
[153:57.27]I'm not dead.
[153:57.95]No, I didn't die.
[154:08.12]I can't, like, talk, right?
[154:09.14]So, like, ask the nurse for food in sign language.
[154:12.15]You know, like, tell her.
[154:14.53]You ask the nurse for food in sign language, and she gives you a bowl of milk.
[154:18.03]You eat it and become stronger.
[154:29.49]Consume more milk.
[154:37.93]You continue to drink the milk, becoming stronger.
[154:40.49]Eventually, you reach adulthood.
[154:42.21]You go strong enough to fight off the bandits, and you live happily ever after.
[154:45.94]Congrats, you win.

[155:24.06]You have darts and a dagger.
[155:25.82]You walk in the midst of the crowd in search of some place to steal from.
[155:29.02]You decide on a chest filled with coins.
[155:39.03]Snort the coins.
[155:44.01]Too weak.
[155:44.39]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[155:44.97]Wait, what?! !
[156:09.72]You snort the coins and feel them hit your nose You then sniff the air A lot of people are looking at you now They all look like they want something from you You can't tell what they want because they're all staring at you Sniff the chest that it came out of
[156:34.26]Your nostrils detect the scent of a man who has been hiding in the shadows for quite some time.
[156:38.67]He smells like an old friend.
[156:40.77]You sniff the chest again and find that there are several chests filled with gold coins.
[156:45.07]There are also a few pieces of jewelry and other trinkets.
[156:49.74]Collect the trinkets.
[156:52.08]I'm just a dog.
[156:55.18]Alright, we're RP and his dog now.
[156:59.39]You grab one of the coins and put it in your pocket.
[157:01.63]Then you go over to another chest and grab a necklace.
[157:05.03]Then you go back to the first chest and grab a ring.
[157:07.75]Finally, reach the last chest and grab a bracelet.
[157:09.97]You open the chest and pull out the items inside.
[157:21.34]Bark at the chest.
[157:24.52]You jump down from the wall and attack the chest.
[157:27.96]You try to pry the lid off but it resists your efforts.
[157:30.68]You rip the lid off and see a small golden key.
[157:33.10]You turn around and run away.
[157:35.42]What was that?
[157:36.45]Asks a voice behind you.
[157:38.81]Bark at the man.
[157:45.79]You stop barking and stare at him.
[157:47.81]He looks like he wants to say something but he doesn't know how.
[157:51.09]You decide to just let him be.
[157:53.02]You walk over to the man and grab his wrist.
[157:57.04]I'm sorry.
[157:58.18]You say.
[158:01.56]The man is shocked at a man is shocked at a talking dog.
[158:14.53]The man is shocked that a dog can talk.
[158:23.99]He turns to you and stares at you, his eyes widened as if he didn't expect this.
[158:29.93]Are you a god?
[158:31.07]He says.
[158:34.34]I say, no, I'm just a dog.
[158:47.75]No, I'm just a dog, you exclaim.
[159:00.81]Ask the man if he has any chew toys.
[159:12.26]You start walking towards the man and he starts running after you.
[159:15.08]You both run into a house.
[159:16.98]Inside the door is a woman who looks very surprised by your appearance.
[159:20.22]She takes a closer look at you and lets out a gasp.
[159:23.68]She immediately runs over to you and hugs you tightly.
[159:28.61]My home!
[159:34.79]I have made it home.
[159:44.47]Ask for food.
[159:50.60]You sit on her lap and she begins feeding you.
[159:53.42]You happily eat everything she gives you.
[159:55.70]Soon you are full and you begin licking her face.
[159:58.50]When you finish eating, you lick her face again.
[160:01.18]This time she smiles and kisses you on the lips.
[160:07.89]Bark excitedly.
[160:10.21]How do you spell excitedly?

[160:38.27]Come here, come here.
[160:43.62]Come here, come here, she whispers.
[160:45.04]She leads you outside where you both stand in front of a large wooden gate.
[160:51.04]Wait to see what she does.
[160:58.13]A figure wearing a hooded cloak stands in front of you.
[161:01.07]You don't recognize her, but she seems familiar.
[161:04.03]She raises her hand and you hear a click
[161:07.33]She opens her mouth and you see a black object fly out of it.
[161:11.13]It looks like a silver crossbow.
[161:19.08]Catch... Catch the crossbow in your mouth.
[161:23.78]Catch the crossbow in your mouth.
[161:28.65]Catch the arrow in your mouth.
[161:34.37]Catch the arrow in my mouth.
[161:42.76]You catch the arrow in your mouth and hold it close to your body.
[161:46.38]You slowly raise your arm and fire the arrow at the cloaked figure.
[161:50.28]As soon as the bolt hits her, she screams and falls backwards.
[161:53.60]Her scream causes everyone else to step back.

[198:46.29]You open up the first letter and read, Dear Mr. Bridges, I'm sorry I haven't written back yet.
[198:50.47]Oh, no, the next letter opens up into a poem.
[198:53.69]My name is Mary and I'm not afraid.
[198:56.30]I don't know why, but I just feel safer with you.
[198:59.20]We were together once and we'll be together again.
[199:06.14]Open another letter.
[199:10.87]The third letter opens up into a song.
[199:14.19]I'm a stranger in a strange land where there's no place for me to hide.
[199:19.03]There's no one here to help me, so I'll be leaving this town soon.
[199:24.12]That song sucks.
[199:29.08]Open another letter.
[199:32.74]The fourth letter opens up into a poem.
[199:35.79]I'm a traveler on a journey with no destination in sight.
[199:39.53]I'm lost, but I can see that there's beauty all around me.
[199:48.18]Open another one.
[199:53.54]Whoops, that- Oh, right.
[200:01.89]Open them all.
[200:08.03]Open all the letters.
[200:09.89]Opening all the letters causes the game to play an ending cutscene.
[200:15.87]Afterwards, you get a message from your mother saying that she's coming home as well.
[200:19.88]She says she's going to try to find some food before heading out.
[200:28.54]Alright.
[200:29.94]Burn all the letters.
[200:32.00]You decide to burn all the letters.
[200:33.23]This causes the game to end abruptly.
[200:37.55]Get on my bike and travel to Charleston.
[200:48.25]You ride off into the distance.
[200:49.45]The sun sets behind you.
[200:51.11]But it doesn't matter now.
[200:52.53]You're done with this world.
[201:08.80]Park on the side of the road.
[201:13.83]You stop your bike near the roadside and look around.
[201:15.67]There isn't much else to do.
[201:17.41]So you head back to the inn.
[201:19.05]When you arrive, you see that the owner has returned.
[201:20.77]He looks tired, but happy to see you.
[201:26.10]Give him a letter.
[201:33.04]You hand him a letter and he reads it.
[201:35.10]He smiles and thanks you.
[201:36.68]He then tells you to go back to the inn and tell them about how good the food was.
[201:40.15]They should definitely open up again.
[201:51.24]Give him a hug?
[201:53.54]Get back on my bike.
[202:02.65]You return to the Inn and tell them about how good the food was.
[202:04.61]They should definitely open up again.
[202:05.85]Attempt to fly to Charleston.
[202:15.69]Are there planes?
[202:21.34]You attempt to fly to Charleston, but you crash into a tree instead.
[202:24.74]You die instantly.
[202:39.55]Post-apocalyptic.
[202:43.39]As a... survivor.
[202:52.41]I don't know.
[202:52.85]Sam.
[202:53.27]Who cares?
[202:59.15]You are Sam.
[203:00.51]I write Sam because it's Sam Porter Bridges.
[203:02.39]God damn it.
[203:04.53]You are Sam, a survivor trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world by scavenging among the ruins of what is left.
[203:09.91]You have a hatchet and a hunting rifle.
[203:12.27]You live in a small community of survivors who manage to build a piece of civilization after the bombs fell.
[203:16.91]You're talking to one of the leaders of the community when you hear a voice call out.
[203:23.59]ask the leader ask the leader to check it out to check to check ask the leader to check on the voice ask no no no no no listen to the voice
[203:47.85]You turn around and see a man with a long beard and wearing a robe standing near the door.
[203:52.25]He looks like he might be an elder, but he has a friendly face.
[203:55.64]Samuel, it's good to see you again, the elder says.
[204:01.38]Say, who are you?
[204:03.62]No, no, no, say, ask who they are.
[204:10.29]Don't want to shoot him.
[204:13.41]We're from the community of New Jerusalem, Samuel replies.
[204:16.41]New Jerusalem?
[204:17.89]What happened there?
[204:30.38]Ask what happened.
[204:39.18]The village was destroyed by a nuclear bomb.
[204:41.34]We were lucky that it didn't hit us.
[204:46.07]Tell them they are safe here.
[204:54.62]I'm glad to hear it.
[204:55.66]I've been looking all over for you.
[205:02.48]Ask to see his license.
[205:06.66]Ask to see his credentials.
[205:15.85]Yes, we are.
[205:16.55]My name is Father Michael.
[205:18.39]Okay, that's a... Didn't you... What did he introduce himself as?
[205:21.44]Somebody just gave a shitload of money.
[205:26.30]Edible Cockroach just gave a hundred bucks.
[205:28.94]Ten thousand bits.
[205:29.82]They say, Merry Christmas, German.
[205:31.96]Love to all in the chat.
[205:34.09]Thank you, Adorable Cockroach, for the insane amount of money.
[205:39.97]Edible Cockroach.
[205:41.11]Edible Cockroach, right.
[205:42.87]Sorry.
[205:43.91]I don't know why I said Adorable.
[205:48.13]Merry Christmas to you, too.
[205:49.03]Thank you.
[205:51.80]That's a fucking lot of money.
[205:54.30]How did I... No, it's adorable cockroach, not edible.
[205:57.04]I got it right.
[205:58.46]It is adorable.
[205:59.30]I read it correct.
[206:02.28]I just get gaslit right there.
[206:13.05]Ask to see his Bible.
[206:15.75]It's in my office upstairs.
[206:18.41]Tell them to go get it.
[206:27.05]Oh no, I can't let you do that.
[206:28.25]You'll just take it back.
[206:35.14]Ask them, say, give me the Bible.
[206:48.22]Fine, but you better hurry up or else you won't make it back before nightfall.
[207:00.92]Go get the Bible.
[207:07.65]You walk into the room and find the book lying on a table.
[207:09.69]There is a note attached to it.
[207:12.87]Read the note.
[207:19.56]Dear Brother Sam, I'm sorry about your loss.
[207:23.22]I know how hard it must be to lose someone so close.
[207:26.10]I will try to help you as much as I can.
[207:29.63]I want you to know that I believe that God still hears our prayers.
[207:32.89]He always does.
[207:33.97]Who wrote this?
[207:42.74]I read the Bible.
[207:49.28]After reading the Bible, you look at each page wondering if this is really true.
[207:53.22]Then you realize that you don't need to worry anymore.
[207:55.24]This place isn't going to kill you.
[208:02.79]I see it, I see it, I see it, I see it.
[208:15.51]Am I spelling this wrong?
[208:26.36]Christianity.
[208:31.92]How do you spell Christianity?
[208:37.85]It has to be a capital C?
[208:53.90]You stand up and hug the Bible.
[208:55.68]Thank you, Father Michael, you say.
[208:59.46]Go back to Father Michael.
[209:08.59]Father Michael smiles and nods.
[209:10.11]Good boy.
[209:10.83]Thank you, brother.
[209:11.95]He walks out of the room, leaving you alone.
[209:14.37]Give Father Michael the Bible.
[209:21.45]I spelled his name wrong.
[209:24.63]Shit.
[209:26.35]You run back to the door and open it.
[209:27.83]Give me the Bible, please.
[209:29.29]Shit.
[209:38.23]Yeah, refer, refer, refer.
[209:39.08]All right.
[209:48.78]Thank you, Father Michael.
[209:51.68]Give Father Michael the Bible.
[210:01.92]Father Michael takes the Bible and reads it out loud.
[210:04.97]This is the word of God.
[210:06.67]The truth straight from the mouth of God.
[210:08.79]So live and let truth.
[210:13.37]Say you agree with him.
[210:22.63]You nod your head and smile.
[210:23.83]Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm converted.
[210:32.07]Follow Father Michael.
[210:40.61]You follow Father Michael into the next room where he shows you the way to the bunker.
[210:44.83]As you enter the door, you feel a sense of peace fill you.
[210:47.77]Everything seems to be in order.
[210:48.89]You feel safe and secure.
[210:57.10]Close the bunker door.
[210:59.62]Close the bunker door.
[211:01.04]Close the bunker door.
[211:05.56]You close the door and lock it.
[211:06.74]You sit down in a chair and wait for nightfall.
[211:20.32]Ask Father Michael what his plan is.
[211:30.46]My plan is simple.
[211:32.24]I'm going to hide out in the bunker until morning.
[211:35.76]Then I'm going to return to New Jerusalem to warn everyone.
[211:41.65]Ask what the warning is.
[211:53.80]Well, I guess you could call it a warning after I leave the bunker.
[211:57.24]I'm going to tell everyone that there is a nuclear war coming soon and that they should prepare themselves.
[212:05.96]Tell Father Michael the nuclear war already happened.
[212:26.36]No, not yet.
[212:27.86]We haven't even seen the first mushroom cloud.
[212:33.66]Point out the window at the mushroom cloud.
[212:48.87]Well, that's because it hasn't exploded yet.
[212:52.03]We haven't had time to evacuate the city yet.
[212:54.85]We only got here AFTER the bombs fell!
[213:03.02]Tell... Father Michael... The bomb... Exploded.
[213:15.16]Not yet.
[213:15.78]We haven't gotten to the shelter yet.
[213:18.00]Once we reach the shelter, we'll start evacuating people.
[213:21.68]But right now we have to stay put until the nuclear war happens.
[213:25.76]If we wait any longer, we'll die anyways.
[213:31.44]Tell Father Michael.
[213:33.72]He's crazy.
[213:41.80]What?
[213:42.74]Are you kidding me?
[213:44.56]I mean, come on.
[213:45.28]It's already too late.
[213:46.22]The bombs dropped and now there's a nuclear war happening.
[213:48.60]It's either that or death.
[213:53.14]Tell Father Michael to go outside.
[213:59.75]And look at the bombs.
[214:08.78]Father Michael nods his head and says, Okay, okay, I understand.
[214:12.00]Go outside and look at the bombs.
[214:15.08]I think you'll be able to tell when one has exploded.
[214:19.86]Watch Father Michael examine the bombs.
[214:39.96]You watch Father Michael examining the bombs.
[214:42.96]Looks like those were thermonuclear devices.
[214:45.73]They're huge and they're smoking.
[214:48.29]Looks like they blew a big hole in the ground too.
[214:51.77]Those things must have been dropped from an airplane.
[214:57.43]Ask if he believes you now.
[215:01.25]Ask if he believes me now.
[215:13.03]Of course I believe you now.
[215:15.15]You've done more than anyone else to convince me.
[215:17.55]I just hope you're right.
[215:26.43]Tell father, Michael, we must rebuild.
[215:40.08]We must start a new religion.
[215:41.72]We must start a new religion.
[215:51.52]Yes, yes, I think we should start a new religion.
[215:54.23]A religion dedicated to Jesus Christ.
[215:58.21]I think we should call it the Church of the Savior of Mankind.
[216:02.83]I think we should also change the name of the church to the Church of the Savior of Mankind.
[216:12.85]Tell him that is a bad idea.
[216:21.68]Christianity 2.
[216:25.04]What do you mean?
[216:28.93]Tell him to come up with a new religion.
[216:42.51]All right, fine, fine.
[216:43.45]Come up with a new religion.
[216:44.87]I'll take care of the details.
[216:48.43]Ask him what the new religion is.
[216:55.65]We'll throw it together later.
[217:05.32]I'm pressing him on this.
[217:08.68]It's a secret, just trust me.
[217:09.80]I promise, it's good.
[217:17.86]what is this ask him to stop messing around fine fine but you better not mess around with my religion I swear if you mess with it again I'm gonna make sure you get blown up I disconnected
[217:50.85]Damn it, this one was going good too.
[217:59.48]Damn it.
[218:03.62]He left the chat.
[218:07.82]Oh, right when we were at the, this was like the climax.
[218:12.38]I just tried to reconnect.
[218:13.40]I'm not connected though.
[218:30.00]no damn it just I'm I gotta rerun the cell yeah yep yep yep yep yep yep yep it's dead no that was a good one too and it's doing the same thing it did before
[219:08.80]Damn it.
[219:11.62]Well, I have to reload the whole thing again, so we have to go to the other one.
[219:18.21]So let me refresh this.
[219:29.38]Why did it disconnect?
[219:30.54]It just kind of does that, unfortunately.
[219:32.60]Let's see if I can...
[219:37.20]The Church of the Savior of Mankind.
[219:43.67]Oh, wait a minute.
[219:44.37]No, no, it's dead.
[219:47.82]I really wanted to press that one too and see where that was going.
[219:53.62]Terminate the session and we'll just open the other one.
[220:07.61]Give us the Drew crew hour.
[220:09.15]I'm still into this.
[220:13.41]I have to do this run again.
[220:14.69]Alright, let's do this again.
[220:15.69]Let's try this one.
[220:32.28]Okay, here we go.
[220:34.55]Take off your shoes and pee in them.
[220:37.85]Make a story about the Dru crew.
[220:43.87]What's the site for the other one?
[220:45.69]The web browser one?
[220:46.39]What is it?
[220:47.25]Beta?
[220:47.57]What is it?
[220:56.31]Yeah.
[220:57.08]That's the one.
[220:57.88]I think it's overloaded.
[220:58.94]There we go.
[221:02.80]I got it.
[221:03.04]Yes!
[221:03.60]Okay.
[221:04.28]Coming back.
[221:13.34]I'll do custom.
[221:14.22]Let's do one about me.
[221:17.73]You are Jerma985.
[221:25.59]You are Jerma.
[221:28.13]The numbers will confuse it.
[221:29.49]You are Jerma.
[221:31.50]An online entertainer loved by millions.
[221:40.16]one day you wake up to one day you wake up to that's a stretch one day you wake up to a as being a dog
[222:09.29]One day you wake up.
[222:12.08]Okay.
[222:20.30]You are Derma, an online entertainer loved by millions.
[222:23.23]One day you wake up, you have no memory of how or why.
[222:51.20]Start broadcasting... Start broadcasting... Call of Duty.
[223:29.87]The first thing that happens is the sound of gunfire.
[223:31.94]Followed immediately after is the sound of screaming and yelling.
[223:34.64]Followed shortly after that is the sound of your own voice.
[223:37.10]That's me.
[223:37.60]Hey.
[223:40.21]I say, hey, what is going on, everybody?
[223:47.09]Welcome to the stream.
[224:06.88]spend a hundred dollars on loot you begin to speak into your microphone the first few words are unintelligible the next few words are unintelligible then you begin to understand what you're saying it's a mix between english and a language you don't know go to the call of duty store and buy 500 loot boxes
[224:41.91]You walk out the door and head towards the nearest store, which looks like it's been completely gutted and ransacked, with a large amount of blood splattered all over the floor of the walls, as well as the front window smashed in, leaving you with only broken glass paint.
[224:55.93]It's in the...
[225:14.72]You walk out of the door again this time you find yourself in a small alleyway.
[225:17.32]A quick glance around reveals that there isn't anything else in sight.
[225:19.94]There's no one here either.
[225:29.73]I go into this small alleyway and open my card packs.
[225:39.30]You open your pack and pull out a pack of cards, which you then proceed to tear apart and discard in your haste to get them to work on the game you've just purchased.
[225:46.89]True.
[225:47.47]Very true.
[225:49.65]Everybody knows that there's only, like, 16 cards in that game that are worth having.
[226:29.85]Your eyes light up as you see the name jbumbum7722 appear on your monitor and you quickly send him a message thanking him for his subbing before closing your browser and closing your phone.
[227:07.12]Thanks for the sub.
[227:08.00]Bye.
[227:09.76]Thank the next 500 people in a row, then turn off the stream.
[227:13.54]You turn off the stream and you're done with it for now.
[227:15.50]As you sit down to play some games, think about how much fun it was to play with all those people that were watching you.
[227:48.39]Make a sponsored tweet about a product no one is going to buy.
[228:00.94]You think about it for a while and decide that you should make an advertisement tweet.
[228:04.29]The problem is you don't know what to say.
[229:26.26]You say, hashtag ad, hashtag kind of fun, guys.
[229:29.16]I had the opportunity to check out this new sugar powder.
[229:32.57]It has vitamin C in it and stuff.

[235:16.61]You don't want to deal with this anymore.
[235:17.59]You go back to playing your games and you feel like a complete asshole.
[235:19.85]But hey, at least you got a free meal out of it.
[235:27.41]Turn on my live stream.
[235:40.44]You turn on the live stream and see that the stream is still running.
[235:43.18]It looks like it's going to be a long day.
[235:46.96]Wait, it was on this whole time?
[235:50.62]What did they see while it was running?
[235:54.71]While it was on?
[236:01.85]Stream movies.
[236:03.53]Stream movies.
[236:04.09]Alright, I'm going to stream The Lord of the Rings.
[236:06.95]You look at the screen and see that they saw a lot of stuff, but nothing really out of the ordinary.
[236:12.05]They saw you play a game called Bubble Bobble, and then you played a game called Tic-Tac-Toe.
[236:19.86]Breathe a sigh of relief, and open my Lord of the Rings extended edition Blu-ray.
[236:45.48]Bubble Bobble is a sick game.
[236:52.04]Talk to Twitch chat.
[236:53.08]I gotta get my stream started.
[236:54.36]I gotta stream all the Lord of the Rings.
[236:59.23]You open the extended edition Blu-ray and you notice that there is a new movie playing.
[237:03.57]But it's not the one you were expecting.
[237:05.23]It's called Sorcerer King.
[237:08.11]It's a movie about a sorcerer king who's trying to conquer the world.
[237:13.40]Is this a bootleg version of the thing we did before?
[237:29.25]Livestream the Fellowship of the Ring.
[237:38.94]You turn on the live stream and you see that it is indeed still running.
[237:41.38]The only thing you can tell is that it looks like it's going to be a long day.
[237:44.25]The sun is setting and you are tired.
[237:45.55]You close your eyes and fall asleep.
[237:50.83]While the stream is... Sleeping on stream while streaming the Lord of the Rings.
[237:59.54]I know I'm not supposed to do this.
[238:17.32]Can you imagine if you came to a stream... I can't do it.
[238:29.59]I can't.
[238:29.87]I'll get in trouble.
[238:32.25]I was going to play like a five minute Lord of the Rings clip while I slept in my chair.
[238:38.65]I'm probably going to get suspended.
[238:46.80]No, wake up.
[239:04.35]Do a parody video?
[239:06.03]Wake up and yell at Twitch chat for not hitting his sub train goal.
[239:09.55]You wake up and you realize you forgot to hit your sub train goal.
[239:12.60]So you decide to get on Twitch chat and yell at them for not hitting their sub train goal.
[239:16.06]They don't seem to mind though, so you go back to sleep.
[239:35.34]Wake up screaming.
[239:46.45]Wake up and pause the movie.
[239:58.63]Tell the Twitch chat omega lul.
[240:04.82]Ugh.
[240:47.18]Get suspended from Twitch for streaming Lord of the Rings and sleeping.
[240:54.45]Oh, I spelled Twitch wrong.
[240:57.31]After getting suspended from 12th grade for streaming Lord of the Rings, you decide to go on Twitch chat.
[241:09.04]After getting suspended from 12th grade for streaming Lord of the Rings, you decide to get on Twitch chat again.
[241:14.17]But this time you are going to do something different.
[241:16.41]So you're going to stream Lord of the Rings with no commentary.
[241:23.32]Just enjoy yourself.
[241:34.24]Get banned from Twitch for repeat offenses.
[241:40.70]For a repeat offense.
[241:56.99]After getting banned from 12th grade, you decide to get on Twitch again, but this time you're gonna stream Lord of the Rings with no commentary!
[242:05.66]Just enjoy yourself, the next day comes, but your stream is still running, so much for being suspended.
[242:10.25]I didn't even get banned.
[242:17.91]Pop in the two towers while you stream naked.
[242:31.18]Surely this has to get you banned.
[242:48.66]The next day comes, but your stream is still running.
[242:50.76]So much for being suspended again.
[242:52.54]The next day comes, but your stream is still running.
[242:54.30]So much for being suspended again.
[242:55.46]The next day comes, but your stream is still running.
[242:59.40]I think it's broken.
[243:15.13]Yeah, it's broken.
[243:17.61]MonkaS, MonkaS, MonkaS, MonkaS, MonkaS.
[243:20.33]Alright, I gotta check on the other one.
[243:26.70]I wanna do a Twitch adventure on the big one.
[243:28.92]The one that's more elaborate than this.
[243:31.56]You know what I'm saying?
[243:32.24]We gotta do like a Twitch adventure on this one.
[243:36.77]Or even like opening up YouTube videos.
[243:38.51]You know what I'm saying?
[243:39.37]Alright, this one.
[243:41.93]We'll do one more of these.
[243:44.01]And we should be good to go.
[243:49.72]Uh, reset.
[244:02.63]You are now in the middle of the third week of your suspension and it seems... What?
[244:09.17]You're now in the middle of the third week of your suspension and it seems that it has finally caught up with you.
[244:14.45]Your account was given a 24-hour ban, and then a permanent one was given out after that period of time had passed.
[244:19.96]What kind of sick joke is that?
[244:21.14]Let's turn the stream back on naked again.
[244:41.83]Make a new account and do it again.
[244:44.22]You're now in the middle of the third week of resuspension, and it seems that it's finally caught up with you.
[244:51.82]Make a new account.
[245:00.82]I got IP banned.
[245:04.16]Ban evasion.
[245:11.27]You're now... No, I can't.
[245:12.51]I'm banned.
[245:13.05]I'm IP banned.
[245:31.98]Come on, let's go.
[245:32.64]No, I'm done.
[245:40.81]It's out.
[245:41.67]It's dead.
[245:42.05]I have to, like, reload this.
[245:54.60]Custom.
[245:58.24]Here we go.
[246:01.00]You are a famous singer.
[246:08.54]You are about to write a new hit single.
[246:16.48]Here we go.
[246:25.38]You're a famous singer.
[246:26.12]You're about to write a new hit single.
[246:27.34]Your career is on the rise and you have many fans all over the world.
[246:30.18]But you have no idea what's going on in your life right now.
[246:33.12]What if you never get out of this town?
[246:34.53]What if your career never gets off the ground?
[246:40.15]Uh... Start writing a new song.
[246:52.39]But we're already... Yeah, we're famous.
[246:55.09]This isn't working for you.
[246:55.95]Maybe it's time to try something else.
[246:57.09]Maybe it's time to move.
[246:57.95]Maybe it's time to just give up.
[246:59.45]The next day, you leave the motel and head back home.
[247:03.94]I just started.
[247:07.36]Write a hit song.
[247:18.09]Become a Twitch streamer in this one.
[247:19.51]No, we're going to do that on the other one.
[247:22.16]You decide to go back to the old routine of writing songs and trying to sell them for money.
[247:25.94]But this will be different this one.
[247:27.06]Will be different because you can actually make money doing this instead of just sitting around doing nothing.
[247:31.00]Which you've been doing for years now.
[247:34.80]What are the song's lyrics?
[247:48.11]The first thing you do is take a pen and paper and write down the lyrics of the song.
[247:51.87]Then you take the pen and paper and go sit in your room by yourself and try to come up with some words that sound good.
[248:02.18]What words sound good?
[248:03.66]I want a song out of this.
[248:14.15]You think of some random words that you think would be appropriate for the lyrics of the song, but you don't know how to say them.
[248:18.81]So you don't say anything at all.
[248:21.25]Write lyrics to the song.
[248:26.92]Well, like, I wrote.
[248:29.52]I wrote lyrics to the song.
[248:33.18]Right?
[248:38.76]This isn't a songwriter.
[248:41.80]You start writing the lyrics on a piece of paper, then you put it in your pocket, put your keys in your pocket.
[248:46.31]This is the song, this is the song, this is the song.
[248:49.93]You start writing down the lyrics on a piece of paper, then you put it in your pocket, put your keys in your pocket, put your cell in your pocket, grab a pen from the desk by the desk, and begin to jot down the words that come into mind.
[249:05.24]Right?
[249:05.62]Is that what this is?
[249:11.36]You put it in your pocket, you put your keys in your pocket, put your cell in your pocket, grab a pen.
[249:16.72]Oh.
[249:18.30]What?
[249:20.33]What should I write?
[249:21.63]That was a kid's song.
[249:38.41]Alright, I'm almost ready to move to the other one.
[249:40.25]Alright, we good.
[249:44.82]I'm hitting play on this one.
[249:46.00]It takes a minute to load.
[249:52.76]We'll be back in a second.
[249:53.88]Alright.
[249:58.09]Throw paper in the trash.
[250:12.86]You throw away the piece of paper you were just jotting down, then you look at yourself in a mirror and notice that you're wearing a t-shirt with a picture of a girl on it.
[250:21.11]Take the t-shirt off.
[250:30.17]Picture of a girl on it.
[250:36.71]You take off the t-shirt and notice that it has a picture of a girl on it.
[250:40.54]Then you realize that you've been wearing the same shirt for weeks.
[250:43.02]So maybe it was just one of those shirts that was hanging around in your room.
[250:45.59]That's fucking disgusting.
[251:02.17]Alright, we'll get some different music.
[251:03.49]We're going to move on to the other one.
[251:05.09]This one's fun, but this one seems like it gets... It seems like there's less to do in this one.
[251:23.53]It loops quicker.
[251:24.19]Alright, we'll be ready for the actual one.
[251:27.37]Coming up.

[252:04.86]But you don't find anything out of place.
[252:06.20]Eventually you stop running around and realize how stupid you look.
[252:08.80]Then you realize how stupid you looked when you were writing the lyrics to the song.
[252:11.44]God damn it.
[252:19.78]Why do I have this music on?
[252:20.78]I have to have the religion music on.
[252:34.65]All right.

[252:37.07]It's ready.

[254:13.34]It's time to start a new religion.
[254:17.63]You will call it the Church of the New Age.

[254:52.02]I'm going to start handing out these, you say as you pick up some flyers from your desk.
[254:57.80]We're not even sure if anyone's gonna show up.
[255:01.24]Maybe we should try a different approach, says Amanda.
[255:07.26]Ask Amanda what she wants to do.
[255:12.90]I spelled her name wrong!
[255:24.21]Ask... Amanda...
[255:31.94]what to do.
[255:39.06]Well, I think we need to get more people here for our meeting.
[255:48.59]Agree with Amanda and start recruiting.
[256:02.19]You agree with Amanda that it would be best to get more people in attendance at the meeting, so you decide to head over to the local bar where she works.
[256:09.51]When you arrive, you see several other people there, but no one is paying any attention to you.
[256:16.26]Announce yourself as the coming of... Announce yourself as... Announce... No, no, no, not yourself.

[257:52.11]Attempt to turn
[258:03.92]Water into wine.
[258:10.82]You begin pouring wine into a goblet and then pour some of the wine back out.
[258:15.79]You continue doing this until you have enough to make yourself drunk.
[258:19.33]You drink the wine falsely.
[258:43.64]Demand fealty to the new god.
[258:55.38]When you wake up, you find yourself lying on the floor of a large room.
[258:59.58]There's a door at the end of the hall leading to another room.
[259:02.92]You look around and notice that the walls are covered with paintings of animals and landscapes.
[259:08.76]The room you are currently in looks like a bedroom.
[259:12.71]examine the paintings you walk through the rooms with the paint with you walk through the rooms painting you walk through the rooms painting each one you paint a picture of a beautiful woman but you don't know her name eventually you finish and leave the room hang the paintings

[259:57.72]Gather a crowd of people.
[260:06.47]You call upon the masses to gather outside.
[260:09.05]They quickly assemble and soon you have thousands of followers.
[260:12.55]You lead them to chant and sing songs about you.
[260:15.73]People begin to follow you and by nightfall you have gathered hundreds of followers.
[260:20.56]So what that means is I had thousands and 90% of them left.
[260:31.42]Okay, just so we're clear.
[260:34.76]Lead my followers into the church.
[260:45.47]You lead your followers inside the church.
[260:47.73]You explain that you will be giving a sermon and that you want everyone to listen carefully.
[260:53.07]You then tell them to pray for the salvation of their souls.
[260:57.00]A few hours later, you finish your speech and announce that you will now reveal your true identity.

[263:13.17]Everyone eats happily, and you thank them for listening to your message.

[263:50.00]I know that's lame.

[264:42.47]You stop eating and instead hold up your hands and begin chanting.
[264:46.69]Suddenly you feel a strong force pushing against you.
[264:49.69]You push against it and suddenly everything goes black.
[264:53.18]You awaken in a hospital bed surrounded by doctors and nurses.
[264:56.58]You hear a voice in your head asking why you did this.
[265:03.16]Is it McDonald's?
[265:05.11]Too much McDonald's?
[265:10.25]Ask the doctor.

[267:08.10]You go back to your church and see that most of the people have left.
[267:11.16]Some have gone home.
[267:12.68]Others have stayed away entirely.
[267:15.04]It seems that the event has scared off many people.
[267:18.38]You wonder if you should still stay or go home.
[267:26.59]Gather a crowd of the church.
[267:32.68]You go back to the church and you immediately gather a crowd.
[267:35.80]You tell them that you've been blessed by God and that you'll be revealing your true identity soon.

[294:49.60]Come out of my house!
[294:51.58]Swing it!

[303:23.50]You have a dusty pitchfork and a shiny shovel.
[303:27.55]You wake up early in the morning and start toiling in the fields.
[303:31.07]In the distance, your master is yelling at some other workers.
[303:33.93]He realizes that you're supposed to be working on something else, but you can't concentrate on anything except your task.
[303:38.72]The sun is shining brightly today, so you don't mind digging in the dirt for hours.
[303:58.94]The shovel smashes into your master's face.
[304:01.46]He screams out and falls backwards, knocking his hat off his head.
[304:04.90]You turn around and continue to work.
[304:06.65]Your master grabs your arm and pulls it behind him as he crawls away.
[304:09.45]You feel sick, but you keep digging.
[304:12.35]Come on!
[304:12.81]Finish the job!
[304:15.83]Hit master in head with shovel over and over again.
[304:23.44]Over and over.
[304:28.24]You hit your master again and again with the shovel.
[304:30.10]His body begins to shake and he collapses to the ground.
[304:32.80]He looks like he might die right there.
[304:35.38]You look down at the shovel and then back up at your master who has stopped moving.
[304:38.68]He doesn't seem to know what to do.
[304:43.30]Jump with both feet in air and stomp and land on his head.
[304:50.81]What is this guy made out of?
[305:00.76]You leap forward with both feet in the air.
[305:02.58]You land on top of your master's head and begin kicking him in the face.
[305:06.04]He tries to get up, but you kick him in the stomach instead.
[305:08.20]He cries out in pain and starts clawing at his own face.
[305:11.10]Kill him!
[305:12.78]Jesus!
[305:18.02]Smash his head with a rock!
[305:21.20]Hurry, kill him!
[305:22.14]Like, kill him!
[305:24.17]You slam your fist against your master's skull.
[305:26.33]The force knocks you backwards, but not before smashing your master's head into the dirt.
[305:30.49]He crumbles to the ground.
[305:31.47]You stand up and walk over to your shovel.
[305:32.85]You pick it up and throw it at your ma- Run over master with car.
[305:44.66]You run over your master with your car.
[305:46.74]He screams in agony.
[305:52.67]As the front wheels tear through flesh and bone, blood spurts all over you, your master.
[305:57.75]You stop running when you hear your master scream for help.
[306:00.15]You turn around and see two men approaching.
[306:01.96]He's still alive!
[306:04.98]Throw a grenade at master.
[306:14.13]You throw a grenade at your master.
[306:15.77]It explodes harmlessly against the wall.
[306:18.37]But you hear your master screaming in terror.
[306:20.35]You turn around and find that one of the men is holding a knife to your throat.
[306:32.30]Dodge the knife.
[306:36.50]Watching it.
[306:38.62]Dodge the knife.
[306:40.24]Dodge the knife.
[306:45.11]Tell the girl what happened.
[307:12.37]You explain to the girl what happened.
[307:13.89]She seems very upset by it.
[307:15.25]She tells you she will go talk to her father about this.
[307:17.95]You thank her and leave the house.
[307:32.93]I'm killing this motherfucker.
[307:33.95]Like, I'm not letting this happen.
[307:35.03]I gotta finish him.
[307:36.60]Find my master.
[307:37.34]You rush to where your master is hiding.
[307:39.28]You run past the guards and climb onto the roof.
[307:41.14]You crawl along the side until you reach the first floor.
[307:43.58]There is no way you can sneak up on your master, so you decide to use magic.
[307:51.73]Become invisible.
[308:01.17]You become invisible.
[308:02.51]You hide in a corner and wait for your master to come home.
[308:05.01]When he does, you attack.
[308:08.53]You rip open his clothes and start tearing them off.
[308:10.57]You bite and scratch, ripping out his teeth and gouging out his eyes.
[308:15.81]This guy... Crushed his head under a large stone.
[308:24.22]Like, can this guy die?
[308:25.78]Kurt, off.
[308:28.44]You crouch down and try to lift a large stone that sits above the entrance to the cave.
[308:31.78]You fail and fall to the ground.
[308:33.06]You hear your master coming home and cry out in fear.
[308:36.04]He comes running and sees you lying there.
[308:47.08]Cast fireball at master You cast a fireball at your master it explodes in his face burning it completely black He screams in horror and runs outside You watch helplessly as he attempts to put out the flames of his hands.
[309:09.10]He fails in the fire spreads throughout the cave.
[309:11.30]I
[309:19.26]Cast another fireball at master.
[309:28.29]You cast another fireball at your master.
[309:30.19]This time it explodes in his chest, killing him instantly.
[309:34.72]You watch in horror as the flames consume the cave.
[309:38.20]My god!
[309:40.59]Leave the cave.
[309:46.26]You run back inside the cave and hide in the shadows.
[309:49.16]What?
[309:50.40]You hear the sounds of battle outside and quickly make your escape.
[309:52.95]You don't want to be here anymore.
[309:54.03]I'm going to burn to death in the cave.
[309:59.05]Go deeper into the cave.
[310:05.15]The game is rebelling.
[310:08.59]Eat my tail.
[310:09.03]That's what it wants me to do.
[310:31.30]You take a deep breath and plunge your hand into the wound on your leg.
[310:35.01]You pull out the tail and devour it whole.
[310:37.63]You gulp down the blood and flesh and feel satisfied.
[310:39.69]You return to the altar and kneel next to the statue of the serpent.
[310:43.40]I am granted immortality.
[310:53.29]You raise your hand and touch the statue of the serpent.
[310:55.61]With a wave of your hand you create a portal and step through.
[310:58.34]You emerge in a different place.
[311:00.00]You see a bright light and hear a voice calling to you.
[311:04.04]I am immortal.
[311:11.46]You step through the portal and find yourself in a room filled with people.
[311:14.07]They're all smiling and laughing.
[311:15.25]You recognize some of them, but most of them you haven't seen before.
[311:17.63]One of the people approaches you.
[311:19.95]Ask what they want.
[311:23.42]I am E-mortal.
[311:26.78]They smile and say, we just wanted to wish you well.
[311:30.06]You nod and thank them and begin walking towards the exit.
[311:42.39]Interrogate them in.
[311:43.99]That's bullshit.
[311:48.12]You approach the man and ask why he wants to speak to you.
[311:50.46]He says, well, I was sent here by my king to give you a message to you, that I need you a message.
[312:21.16]It's broken.
[312:44.89]You approach the door and push the handle.
[312:46.21]As you open the door, it swings open.
[312:47.35]You notice it opens and closes.
[312:49.01]I can't, no, I can't.
[312:51.31]That's broken.
[312:52.31]It's broken.
[312:54.31]I gotta revert twice.
[312:55.13]Okay, here we go.
[313:02.56]Tell him to back off.
[313:08.14]You say, I'm sorry, but I need to speak to my master.
[313:11.60]Go find your master.
[313:15.96]Didn't that just blow him up?
[313:19.63]You walk towards the group of people and they all stare at you.
[313:21.53]Some of them point their fingers at you and laugh.
[313:23.81]Others call you names and curse at you.
[313:25.27]Finally, someone calls your name.
[313:26.99]You turn around and run towards the voice and find your master.
[313:39.56]Kill him here so he goes back to Earth.
[313:44.10]This is the only you... Say hello, master.
[313:53.05]It's fucked.
[314:21.35]Leave the cave.
[314:21.93]Let's see if I can get out of here.
[314:26.93]Okay, you walk towards the exit of the cave and notice that the people are now gone.
[314:30.26]You think about how strange that they would just disappear without warning you.
[314:33.84]You wonder if you should go back to check on the cave or stay here.
[314:35.98]You decide to... Put a nuke in the portal.
[314:57.16]Mushroom Club.
[315:02.52]Alright, that's it.
[315:03.48]This is it.
[315:04.04]It's over.
[315:06.42]You decide to go to Disney... You decide to go to Disneyland.
[315:15.31]You decide to take a vacation to Disney World.
[315:27.81]You decide to take a vacation to Disney World.
[315:29.33]You travel to various places in Disneyland.
[315:30.98]You visit various places you've never been to.
[315:33.06]You learn new things about people in the world.
[315:34.56]You meet interesting people in places.
[315:36.78]Okay.
[315:37.26]Die peacefully.
[315:45.35]You die peacefully in your sleep.
[315:46.69]You're surrounded by friends and family who love you.
[315:48.21]Your last moments are spent with them.
[315:49.33]You die.
[315:49.69]Game over.
[315:50.03]I win.
[315:52.89]I went to Disney World.
[315:55.78]Alright, that's it.
[315:56.76]That's it.
[315:57.18]I'm out of here.
[315:59.70]This is a journey.
[316:03.81]I want to do one.
[316:04.53]I want to do like a... Hold on.
[316:11.65]I want to do like a... I want to be like Donald or something.
[316:18.20]No, no.
[316:20.38]Teach us how to play?
[316:22.71]It's sort of complicated in a way.
[316:25.09]You can go to... There's a website you can use.
[316:30.07]It's kind of a weird experiment.
[316:35.45]Hold on.
[316:36.44]Custom.
[316:40.92]You are Donald Duck.
[316:46.46]One of Disney's most iconic characters.
[316:54.25]today you are making people happy at disney world you are donald duck one of disney's most iconic characters today you are making people happy at disney world but performing in a show called the great white way but there's something very wrong with this picture you're not even sure where to begin what
[317:32.50]No, there's no... I... You've run out of... This is the last thing you want to do, but it seems like it's the only way out of this mess to leave.
[317:47.51]The problem is your family's been living here for years.
[317:49.07]Alright, I'm out.
[317:51.73]I'm out.
[317:52.75]I'm out.
[317:53.09]I'm out of here.
[317:53.89]I'm out.
[317:54.33]I'm out.
[317:54.85]I'm out.
[317:56.29]I'm out.
[317:56.91]I'm out.
[317:58.05]I'm out.
[318:05.51]I'm out.
[318:06.05]I'm out.
[318:06.49]That's it.
[318:07.37]Stream over.
[318:08.33]See you later.
[318:08.77]See ya.
[318:09.07]See you tomorrow.
[318:17.54]Fucking goddammit.
[318:19.84]How do you play?
[318:20.58]Okay.
[318:22.04]I want to give those of you that want to know.
[318:23.28]Uh... AI Dungeon is the name of the game.
[318:29.82]You can get it on the App Store right now.
[318:32.32]It's on iOS.
[318:33.38]It's also on Android.
[318:35.82]But the one I'm playing is specifically, it's a collab of, I guess, like the whole program.
[318:44.15]It's not really a game, right?
[318:48.11]You have to install a bunch of stuff.
[318:51.25]Somebody's linked in the chat.
[318:52.74]Essentially, this is a research project that has really kind of taken a mind of its own.
[319:01.77]They have a Patreon which you can go to and support it if you want.
[319:05.45]Like they say on the website, if you go to just go to AI Dungeon, you can get more info.
[319:10.99]Go to aidungeon.io You can read all about it.
[319:24.09]It is available for whoever wants to do it, wants to play it.
[319:28.11]The one I was on is that research, that collab research project.
[319:32.19]It was a lot faster and a lot better.
[319:35.88]The app is actually a lot more stable and easier to use than the PC version.
[319:38.56]Then I would probably say to get the app version.
[319:41.74]Was it on phones?
[319:47.25]To capture the game, though, I don't really have my iPad or phone set up or anything.
[319:56.09]That was a lot of fun.
[319:58.02]But I think there's only so much of that I can take in one day.
[320:05.08]There's also the website too, that beta.
[320:06.80]Beta.ai Dungeons is the one I was playing before that was not the one with the gray background or the black background.
[320:12.84]The mobile version is the official one.
[320:14.54]Okay, well, there you go.
[320:19.72]It is still a very much an experiment.
[320:21.56]So like somebody said before, I wouldn't really classify it as a game as much as an experiment.
[320:30.45]That was hilarious.
[320:32.43]Hope you enjoyed that.
[320:33.25]I'll see you tomorrow.
[320:34.79]Tomorrow's mystery stream.
[320:36.03]Because... I don't know.
[320:38.01]Oh, before I go.
[320:39.65]Make sure the nomination channel is open.
[320:43.50]You really only have... Another... There's really only about six days to make nominations.
[320:52.86]Because I really want to have at least three days to vote and make the videos and everything.
[320:56.91]If you don't know what I'm talking about, at the end of the year...
[321:00.33]I'm just, like, burping.
[321:02.19]At the end of the year, we're doing another New Year's Eve Worst of the Year Awards.
[321:12.92]There's two channels on the Discord right now.
[321:14.64]There's New Year's Eve Award Discussion and New Year's Eve Nominations.
[321:20.45]Does everybody get to vote?
[321:21.67]Yeah, absolutely.
[321:26.21]The categories are listed in the discussion channel.
[321:28.55]That channel is for you to discuss all the categories with anybody that's where you can write whatever you want.
[321:35.13]The nominations channel is only for you to nominate something.
[321:40.73]There's a pinned message on both of those channels.
[321:43.11]Go read the pins.
[321:44.17]They're very, very important.
[321:50.97]I will give a quick breakdown of the nomination channel because I know people want to hear that before, you know, make it official.
[321:58.71]In your nomination, it has to be either a Twitch clip, a VOD timestamp, or a YouTube video timestamp.
[322:11.14]The Stream Archive channel, there's a link to it in that pin, has every single stream I have ever done over the last at least two or three straight years.
[322:22.11]If you're looking for something in particular and you're like, wait a minute, that's not on Twitch.
[322:25.09]That was seven months ago.
[322:26.99]That stream that you're thinking of will be on the archive channel.
[322:33.53]When you nominate something, make it short and sweet.
[322:36.31]That channel's not to discuss anything.
[322:38.61]It's only for you to write what category, a short sentence on what you're nominating, and then the clip or video with a timestamp on it.
[322:47.87]That's it.
[322:52.17]You really only have about six days to do it.
[322:56.27]If you want to participate, I implore you to do so.
[323:00.46]Can we play Surge 2 tomorrow?
[323:04.36]I... I don't know.
[323:06.44]I'll have to be into that.
[323:07.76]We'll see how I feel tomorrow about that one.
[323:14.46]Let's go with bits.
[323:16.79]There were some big ones that I may have missed.
[323:21.29]But that's why I'm going over them now.
[323:28.04]What was the stream when I was making movies and singing with the food alphabet?
[323:32.28]That was Mindshow.
[323:37.72]There's a nomination discussion channel.
[323:39.14]Oh yeah, there's two.
[323:40.46]There's a discussion channel and there's a nomination channel.
[323:42.96]The discussion channel is for talking about everything.
[323:46.06]Nominations are only for just a submission.
[323:48.68]That's it.
[323:50.99]They're both available right now.
[323:53.99]Anyways.
[323:55.75]Let's go to earlier this afternoon.
[323:58.30]We had Sly161 gave 250 bits.
[324:02.00]Hey, German Drew Crew expert here.
[324:03.70]I've played all the games.
[324:05.62]I have a few more on disk.
[324:06.72]Let me know if you need advice.
[324:07.58]That's a lot.
[324:12.67]I hope to one day have this many Drew Crew games installed on my Steam.
[324:20.99]You got like 30 here.
[324:24.61]That's pretty great.
[324:26.77]Those of you that are curious how many games it takes to be able to call yourself part of a Drew crew.
[324:31.22]There it is.
[324:31.78]Ow.
[324:35.98]Thank you, Sly.
[324:36.78]Appreciate it.
[324:37.58]The 250.
[324:39.72]A triple zero.
[324:41.50]Neo, thanks for the 250.
[324:42.86]Holy fuck, man.
[324:43.44]I'm literally crying with laughter.
[324:44.68]This is me laughing louder than I ever have before.
[324:47.02]Please try chasing yourself and see what happens.
[324:49.28]Damn it.
[324:52.93]Ah, damn it.
[324:54.07]That would have been funny.
[324:58.65]I love shit like this, though.
[325:00.91]There's at least a few times when my body hurt from laughing at some of this stuff.
[325:04.85]It's just so bizarre.
[325:08.22]It's just so out-fucking-rageous.
[325:11.72]We had five community subs from Germasucks.
[325:13.34]Thank you, Germasucks.
[325:14.08]You've been killing it with the subs recently, the last few streams.
[325:18.78]Appreciate it.
[325:23.86]Adorable Cockroach, not only did you give a ton of money, you gave some other donations that were not read.
[325:29.79]Here's a thousand bits from Adorable Cockroach.
[325:31.87]This game is becoming self-aware.
[325:33.31]Run while you still can.
[325:38.03]I did.
[325:40.22]I did.
[325:40.52]Thank you.
[325:43.55]Hey, PlankV2, thanks for the 500 bits.
[325:45.63]Jeremy, you seem like the kind of guy that owns a mug that has his initials on it.
[325:48.92]Jeremy, disgust.
[325:49.58]I do.
[325:50.72]Also, I played the heck out of Zork when I was younger.
[325:53.16]Those games always made me frustrated.
[325:57.58]I do.
[325:57.80]I have a J-Cup.
[325:58.56]I do.
[326:00.64]You can get them... I have a J... But that was like a thing with me and Kim.
[326:09.01]I have a J-Cup and she has a K-Cup.
[326:12.48]It's like, oh, these are our cups.
[326:13.82]That one's mine.
[326:14.46]That one's yours.
[326:15.12]It's not about having my initials on something.
[326:16.72]It's like a cute thing that me and Kim did.
[326:20.87]I know.
[326:21.85]Whatever.
[326:29.31]But, thank you, Plank.
[326:32.39]Appreciate it.
[326:33.55]Ah, Zork.
[326:33.91]I don't know if it's Zork.
[326:36.05]KXZ, thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[326:38.93]I missed it earlier.
[326:42.16]5,000 bits, $50 from KXE.
[326:43.56]Thank you.
[326:45.57]Merry Christmas, Germo.
[326:46.27]Hope you're having a good time this festive season.
[326:47.89]Also, small tip for AI Dungeon.
[326:49.99]The AI usually has an easier time understanding inputs if you were them in second person.
[326:56.51]Yeah, after the first two, I started to kind of figure out how to make the game talk the way that I wanted it to.
[327:02.78]It's still kind of odd, though.
[327:06.22]Thank you, and thanks for the huge amount of money.
[327:11.20]What is his image?
[327:14.62]Hated streamer dies in prison.
[327:16.39]Christianity 2 reaches space with prayer.
[327:18.97]Receives ring from God.
[327:20.49]This is funny.
[327:31.17]This is funny.
[327:34.47]I gotta show this one.
[327:46.74]uh adorable cockroach you gave a ton of community subs as well as the huge amount of bit donations thank you so much thank you kazzy for the five subs another thousand bit donation from adorable cockroach more when are you doing a sleep stream um
[328:09.07]If I could get away with it, it might be funny to do it for like an hour.
[328:12.95]But have a reason why it's happening.
[328:15.71]But you can't do that.
[328:16.73]You're not allowed to do that on Twitch.
[328:20.57]Adorable Cockroach, again, another $9.
[328:23.47]900 bits.
[328:25.95]Damn.
[328:26.99]Long live the king.
[328:29.29]Thank you, Adorable Cockroach.
[328:30.45]When am I going to do a gym stream?
[328:37.42]I can barely turn my body right now.
[328:39.75]I can barely walk around.
[328:44.43]I'm falling apart.
[328:45.31]You think I can lift weights right now?
[328:54.88]Gym stream.
[328:55.60]I actually do have to go to physical therapy.
[328:59.92]Yeah.
[329:00.42]Yeah.
[329:02.49]I have to go actually to a... I have to go to a pain doctor and then physical therapy.
[329:06.27]It's fucking just... It sucks.
[329:08.41]But whatever.
[329:09.81]You do what you have to do.
[329:10.98]And that's what I'm gonna do.
[329:14.96]What happened?
[329:16.42]Um... I have a hernia.
[329:19.62]And I have...
[329:21.31]What they think is something called costochondritis.
[329:24.51]Which means my ribcage sucks.
[329:27.29]And is, like, locked up and inflamed.
[329:30.05]At the joints.
[329:30.71]I don't know.
[329:31.97]It's stupid.
[329:33.46]It's just dumb.
[329:34.04]Whatever.
[329:34.92]It's just dumb.
[329:35.64]Whatever.
[329:38.58]But yeah.
[329:38.90]No, I'm good.
[329:40.60]Tar Alecran thanks to the 250.
[329:42.20]This was one of the funniest streams I've ever seen.
[329:44.24]I'm in tears.
[329:45.54]I'm so happy to have been a part of it.
[329:48.27]Glad you liked it.
[329:51.96]I fucking thought it was funny.
[329:55.26]But you know what my favorite part about this whole stream was?
[329:58.32]Killing the old lady in the house and not knowing who she was or knowing her name, but she had a note in her pocket for me.
[330:06.25]That was probably the pinnacle of the whole night, I think.
[330:13.75]It was unbelievable.
[330:17.80]If you can afford them, the trigger point injections help my caustic arthritis.
[330:32.89]That's one of the things we might do.
[330:35.33]The only reason why I don't want to do a... Like a steroid injection into my ribcage... Is... I've heard it's not that great for you.
[330:47.22]I heard you're not really supposed to do it that often, and if you do... It's not the greatest thing to do all the time.
[330:53.42]I know, you gotta be careful with steroids.
[331:03.54]But it's not even 100% that that's exactly what's wrong.
[331:08.05]It would make a whole lot of sense, but that is not... That's what they think it is.
[331:13.73]And until...
[331:15.62]Honestly, here's the worst part about this.
[331:20.20]Let's give you the long and short of it.
[331:22.42]About a year and a half ago, I started to get pain in my back.
[331:25.58]Like, middle of my back and middle of my chest.
[331:28.98]Just, I would turn to be like, ah, fuck.
[331:31.17]I would turn, ah, fuck.
[331:33.13]Almost like my center core in a straight line from the top of my shoulders down to my abdomen.
[331:40.61]Front and back just hurt.
[331:43.48]If I turn the wrong way, it's like pulling something and boom, hurting, boom, hurting, right?
[331:49.67]Six months ago, it started to get a little worse.
[331:52.99]Like, in the middle of my chest was actually starting to hurt.
[331:56.43]I'd lean back and kind of spread my ribcage out and it'd be like, ah!
[332:01.62]So I've been going, I've been doing a bunch of tests.
[332:04.62]And the weird thing about pain, is what I've been told, so many things cause pain.
[332:12.70]that trying to find out what the exact thing that causes pain could take a lifetime.
[332:20.65]So many things can cause back pain.
[332:23.26]Almost every organ in your entire body can cause back pain.
[332:29.43]it's just it's ruling out shit until there's nothing left to rule out and then you get a true diagnosis of something like like a pain illness something like a costochondritis or like a fibromyalgia or something right and I'm just on that road to find out exactly what the hell's wrong with me who knows I don't know that's medicine
[333:05.53]Is it caused from not exercising?
[333:07.87]Contrary to maybe popular belief, maybe what people might think, I actually move around quite a lot.
[333:16.41]I go for walks.
[333:18.55]I go on errands every day.
[333:21.53]Kim and I will go out and do things.
[333:23.05]I'm not just lying in my bed.
[333:25.77]I don't just stream and then go, all right, that was a good stream.
[333:29.53]Let's just go to bed until tomorrow when I turn it on.
[333:37.36]I'm fairly active when it comes to walking around.
[333:39.96]I walk around pretty much every day.
[333:47.57]You don't sit in stasis until stream?
[333:50.65]No.
[333:52.83]Not really.
[333:56.61]But, to put a cap on it,
[333:59.96]My back hurts, my rib cage hurts, and the middle of my chest hurts.
[334:03.68]I was, and it could be like two or three things going on at the same time.
[334:07.53]I was diagnosed with a hiatal hernia.
[334:10.99]That's probably what's causing the stuff in the middle of my chest.
[334:13.43]That I, you live with it and you deal with it and you manage it until you eventually want to have surgery to remove it.
[334:19.83]That's the only, that's it.
[334:22.89]The stuff with the back and the ribs, it might be something completely different.
[334:28.20]So, or maybe it's all the higher hernia.
[334:30.56]I don't know.
[334:33.48]It's just medical bullshit.
[334:37.26]But it's not affecting me to a point where it's causing me any real problems, right?
[334:42.51]I can still walk around.
[334:43.47]I can still move around.
[334:44.27]I just can't... Fast movements or moving too far in one direction.
[334:49.61]Like, for instance, you guys, here's a perfect example of what I'm talking about.
[334:53.31]Those of you that drive cars.
[334:55.16]You know when you put the car in reverse, and you turn to look out the back of your rear of your, you know, look out the back window.
[335:05.58]You know, that movement.
[335:06.50]That, put my arm up, look out the, ouch!
[335:11.12]That's when it really hurts.
[335:17.69]It's movements like that in both directions.
[335:22.53]what the rear view mirror is for yeah I know I use my rear view mirror I use my windows and everything but that that movement people do well you know you you turn that far and also I don't like I don't just trust the one mirror I gotta look I gotta see everything I gotta take it I gotta look at the sides and I can look at the back and then the rear rear view mirror I gotta I don't just look up and you'll miss something that rear view mirror you can't trust it you gotta get your whole peripheral
[335:56.24]Put your head out the window.
[336:02.41]Yeah, that was a very long-winded story, but that's kind of where it's at now.
[336:10.54]But thank you, Smelly Boy, for the $2.50.
[336:12.02]Yeah, I had a lot of fun.
[336:14.10]This was, besides the, obviously, the times where it crashed and we were, you know, dead air for about five, ten straight minutes.
[336:21.01]It was hilarious.
[336:21.61]I had a lot of fun.

[338:30.37]Thanks again for watching, everybody.
[338:31.35]We'll see you tomorrow for a mystery stream.
[338:33.45]It could be The Surge 2.
[338:34.17]It could be Dead Rising 3.
[338:36.23]It could be Nancy Drew Sea of... Sea of Thieves.
[338:44.15]Whatever it was.
[338:44.79]It could be.
[338:45.91]It's a mystery stream.
[338:50.83]It could be Jump King DLC.
[338:53.33]It's not going to be Jump King DLC.
[338:58.67]Could be Red Alert, too.
[339:00.65]I don't know.
[339:02.07]It could be anything.
[339:02.93]It could be Sea of Thieves.
[339:09.33]Could it be Sam and Max?
[339:10.29]No.
[339:11.77]I told you, I already... No, I'm sorry.
[339:15.30]Season 3 just didn't do it for me.
[339:16.54]I'm sorry.
[339:17.50]I really liked the first two seasons.
[339:18.78]They were very good.
[339:19.30]I'm just not... Didn't lie about Sam and Max season 3.
[339:22.66]I already covered those bases.
[339:25.35]My money?
[339:26.03]What do you guys think I'm gonna do?
[339:28.09]Disco Elysium?
[339:29.47]Hmm, yeah, that could be, but that's a long game.
[339:34.22]Hey, very nice.
[339:34.94]Thanks for thousand bits.
[339:36.12]I visited a Buddhist temple in southern Japan last year to clear my head and gain spiritual enlightenment.
[339:42.00]Unfortunately, it was closed due to being the wrong season, and I had to walk back down the mountain.
[339:48.25]If you had a round-trip ticket to anywhere in the world, where would you go and why?
[339:54.51]that real that's that that sucks man uh if I could go anywhere round trip why um I would okay I want to go to I would want to go to antarctica do I get an infinite infinite amount of money
[340:16.04]I want to be in one of those big three jackets where I'm just waddling like a toddler around looking at ice crystals and penguins and stuff.
[340:26.79]And I need to have like ten people that I hire that come with me to make sure I stay alive.
[340:34.86]Does that include money that I... I have infinite money, right?
[340:37.20]I need ten... Yeah, I need ten people for that.
[340:45.32]I want to have the good cold, chilly, like white booger crystal face.
[340:52.02]While I'm just like, oh man, this is really cold.
[340:54.74]And I want to do it.
[340:57.86]And like go to look at the ice and the glaciers and... I mean, the second answer is I'd go to Japan and go to Tokyo.
[341:05.59]I mean, I never, I want to do that as number two.
[341:09.77]But you said anywhere and do anything in the world.
[341:18.82]Okay, just because you want to go to Tokyo, that has nothing to do with how much I enjoy anime.
[341:26.49]It's an interesting place on Earth.
[341:29.61]You know, guys, I think I really want to go to Japan because of how much I love anime.
[341:36.18]What?
[341:38.10]It's one of the most, like, it's one of the most, like, culturally dense places on Earth.
[341:42.92]I like the anime.
[341:46.93]I want to go!
[341:47.51]I want to go and like see everything and take in everything.
[341:56.48]Clip it, yeah.
[342:00.08]But yeah, there you go.
[342:01.65]I want to go to Antarctica.
[342:04.44]And I want to get infinite money.
[342:06.06]I want like a $60,000 camera with a lens that's as big as a telescope.
[342:11.91]And I want to, even if I don't know what I'm doing, who cares?
[342:13.43]There's 10 people there.
[342:14.29]There's 10 people that have to fucking deal with me.
[342:16.98]One of them is going to be a professional photographer.
[342:18.88]So I can just pretend like I'm a really good photographer and like typically pictures of polar bears and stuff.
[342:24.15]Like, I'm gonna have the guy set up the shot, and then I go, move please, and I go down, and I look, then I do a little bit of focusing, do rack focus, change the f-stop, click, and it's my photo.
[342:45.10]There are no polar bears in Antarctica.
[342:50.25]Well, whatever, I'll...
[342:53.42]I'll take a picture of a seal or a penguin.
[342:58.51]Hey Jude, Minecraft, thanks for the 300 bits.

[343:26.80]This is just, actually, I'm not clicking that.
[343:29.84]And I don't, don't click that one.
[343:32.42]Um, I don't know.
[343:33.20]I thought that was a Jupiter.

[343:36.94]Thank you for the $2.50.
[343:37.44]Appreciate it.
