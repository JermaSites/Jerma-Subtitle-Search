[05:01.59]If you want, let's do some 1v1s to warm up a little.
[05:06.03]And take a look.
[05:08.19]LeBron James is in the game.
[05:11.45]And he's fun as fuck.
[05:17.82]I've already played it.
[05:18.94]Look, I've been messing around in the Xbox version.
[05:24.18]And I'm ready.
[05:24.66]LeBron James has this dunk move that you just need to touch somebody with it and it's over.

[06:22.07]Here we go.
[06:35.68]Don't get in my head already.
[06:36.84]I haven't even started playing.

[09:36.33]It's a warm-up.
[09:36.99]It's a warm-up.
[09:38.01]It's a warm-up.
[09:38.57]It's a warm-up.
[09:39.13]It's a warm-up.
[09:39.63]Sorry.
[09:39.83]It's a warm-up.
[09:44.22]It's a warm-up.
[09:44.92]I haven't played.
[09:45.46]It's a warm-up.
[09:48.56]I fucked up in that first part.
[09:49.98]Let's go again.
[09:50.52]Again.
[09:50.82]Again.
[09:51.02]Let's go.
[09:53.45]You get beat by bugs.
[09:54.31]Bugs is awesome!
[09:55.11]What are you talking about?
[09:58.35]I thought you were practic- No, this isn't a bot!
[10:00.41]This is a person!
[10:04.12]That's copium.
[10:05.24]It's match number one out of like 60 today!

[10:08.68]We're going LeBron again.
[10:09.54]I gotta just like get the sh- I gotta like shake it out of me!
[10:18.65]Did you see though?
[10:19.63]Did you see how good I was playing?
[10:22.92]I was threw up.
[10:25.13]When's Rick and Morty coming out?
[10:26.51]I don't know.
[10:26.83]I have no idea.
[10:28.93]I just know what's here now.
[10:30.67]I don't know what any other characters that could be in the game.
[10:35.03]I don't even have any perks.
[10:37.70]Look, I got to just get it out of my system.
[10:39.00]Look, here we go.
[10:45.00]Alright, let's go.
[10:48.80]Prepare yourselves.
[10:56.23]Yeah, it's open beta.
[10:58.07]You can literally go get it right now.
[10:59.55]Open beta.
[11:00.61]Progress stays, by the way.
[11:02.09]All your progress stays, by the way.
[11:03.97]Alright, let's go.
[11:06.33]No more fucking around.
[11:07.03]What are you doing?
[11:15.72]What are you doing?
[11:17.92]What are you... How's about you make like a tree and leave?
[11:26.09]Alright, you can get... Okay, get me to 19.
[11:27.85]Get me to 19%.
[11:28.69]Go on.
[11:28.93]Alright, get me to 19%.
[11:31.55]That's alright.
[11:31.99]A little bit.
[11:33.97]A little bit more.
[11:37.16]No, no, no.
[11:37.66]Get that shit out of here.
[11:38.96]Get that shit out of here.
[11:39.88]No, excuse me.
[11:40.84]Get that shit out of here.
[11:42.22]This is going to be extra damage.
[11:43.26]It's going to be more than 19.
[11:44.30]Alright, game on.
[11:50.48]Literally game on.
[12:56.46]Fuck you!
[13:30.95]What are you talking about?
[14:34.31]Excuse me?
[14:34.83]What the fuck just happened there?
[14:37.84]Huh?
[14:38.16]I was on top of bugs and did my da- Excuse me?
[14:43.44]I was on top- I was the one on top!
[15:03.63]That was a good warm up.
[15:07.11]Don't run that clip back.
[15:08.19]I'm up top and I go down and he goes down and I'm the one that goes down.
[15:15.91]Alright, let's go.
[15:24.09]It's okay.
[15:24.43]Maybe video games aren't your thing.
[15:28.68]It's quiet.
[15:40.50]You snooze, you lose.
[15:41.24]Nobody said Mario Tennis Meltdown incoming.
[15:55.34]Look, I finally got my first perk.
[15:57.98]Alright, that was a warm up.
[16:06.33]Look, I gotta get my blood pumping.
[16:12.11]When does the beta end?
[16:14.19]Prepare yourself.
[16:16.13]That's a really good question.
[16:18.90]I don't know.
[16:20.60]It's just an open beta now.
[16:22.58]I wonder what they'll do.
[16:25.00]I think it's going through August, right?
[16:30.56]We'll find out.
[16:31.04]Alright.
[16:31.32]This is what we've been training for.
[16:35.29]Why the goddess?
[16:36.79]Where did I park that jet?
[17:30.18]I need that ball.
[18:02.44]Oh my god, just hit the person!
[18:30.89]It's not the move I wanted to do.
[18:39.78]finally Jesus I need that ball you're so you're just useless without it in your hand match point red team
[19:09.96]I knew you were going to do that and I just pulled together.
[20:28.43]That's it.
[20:31.55]That's it!
[20:34.99]That's not it!
[20:37.39]Oh!
[20:38.15]Damn it!
[20:48.92]That's it.
[21:16.85]Stupid!
[21:18.23]Oh my god!
[21:23.75]Oh my god!
[21:24.79]Oh, it's so hard.
[21:32.10]Shit!
[21:32.70]That was a good match.
[21:36.34]That was a good match, good match, good match.
[21:37.69]We'll do it again.
[21:42.28]There's a lot of whiffs.
[21:44.01]Yeah, I think with LeBron is if you don't hit the basketball, you lose.
[21:49.57]That's just the way it is.
[21:52.86]I like the way he plays.
[21:53.82]It's fun.
[21:55.00]Why are you throwing?
[21:59.86]Throwing?
[22:00.20]I came back.
[22:01.91]I was down by 80 points.
[22:10.29]I came back.
[22:10.69]I was down by 80 points.
[22:12.09]I came back.
[22:18.70]Just old man reactions.
[22:24.88]Do the air neutral more?
[22:29.14]With or without the ball?
[22:34.27]From 1 to 10, how do you rate yourself as a gamer? 8.5.
[22:39.69]Super Mario 2.
[22:42.00]Dark Souls games 8.
[22:42.78]Then it averages out after that.
[22:46.82]Oh my God, I'm getting fucking annihilated.
[23:14.42]Oh my god, I can't even play the game.
[23:20.05]How did I let him do that?
[23:32.06]Does that move not go through anything?
[23:33.50]I feel like it doesn't.
[23:50.53]That move doesn't go through anything!
[23:53.31]Holy shit!
[23:54.37]Alright, I can't get two out here.
[24:18.82]Jesus!
[24:31.23]Okay, maybe it's not LeBron.
[24:34.80]Holy shit, this guy's level 1.
[24:36.18]That doesn't make any sense.
[24:38.82]Is this guy level 1 Shaggy?
[24:40.34]No way.
[24:40.72]That's not a level 1 Shaggy.
[24:41.54]That's a level 60 Shaggy.
[24:42.54]Alright, we're going to go back to Bugs.
[24:59.33]He was level 14?
[24:59.77]Oh.
[25:01.37]I thought he was level 1.
[25:04.27]I thought he was level 1!
[25:05.09]Okay, back to bugs for a little while.
[25:11.89]Can you wish my dog a happy birthday?
[25:21.26]Oh, that's horrible.
[25:23.68]Happy birthday.
[25:24.38]I'm sorry you're going through that.
[25:26.82]To your dog.
[25:32.59]You have to use an S tier character.
[25:36.13]Everybody else is.
[25:43.23]How much you spent on skins?
[25:44.31]I don't want to talk about it.
[25:47.59]None.
[25:52.14]It's so nice.
[25:52.62]He keeps letting his opponents win.
[25:55.00]Stop it.
[25:55.50]I'm going to just wait.
[25:58.08]Watch this one here.
[26:00.80]Watch this one here.
[26:02.31]Watch this one here.
[26:02.85]Check this one out.
[27:29.97]Blue team.
[27:30.56]You win that time.
[28:02.01]God damn it!
[28:10.67]Wrong way!
[28:11.35]Sorry, sorry.
[28:19.73]Match point, red team.
[28:22.41]You'll regret it.
[28:56.94]Yes!
[28:58.88]Yes!
[29:05.34]Good fight.
[29:08.08]Good fight.
[29:08.54]Good fight.
[29:09.14]Good fight.
[29:09.92]Good fight.
[29:11.08]Very good fight.
[29:11.72]I'm going to talk about how bad my LeBron is ever again.
[29:15.56]Well, you can't because it was not very good.
[29:24.32]I feel like I just went cross-eyed into the camera.
[29:26.66]Did I go cross-eyed?
[29:30.12]Don't ever play LeBron ever again.
[29:31.85]I like LeBron.
[29:32.65]It's in my title.
[29:35.07]LeBron's fun with the projectile, but if you miss the ball, you're just gonna lose.
[29:39.47]I just gotta not miss the ball.
[29:44.70]Remember, that was their first game.
[29:46.18]You don't know that.
[29:50.76]Dude, you went green and your eyes bugged out.
[29:53.06]Wait, what?
[29:55.05]Like the Hulk?
[29:59.13]How to train your perks.
[30:00.53]Oh, right.
[30:07.69]Oh, right.
[30:08.19]You can buy ones, can't you?
[30:15.48]This one's good.
[30:17.02]20% reduction to ground and wall bounce velocity.
[30:19.06]Alright, let's go.
[30:21.19]I got money.
[30:26.29]4% reduced incoming damage.
[30:27.47]15% increased base knockback influence.
[30:32.67]That's kind of big.
[30:33.21]That's actually really big.
[30:38.45]You should wear a LeBron jersey while you play as LeBron.
[30:43.01]If I'm going to get destroyed, I can't...
[30:50.33]Air acceleration.
[30:51.13]A little more offense.
[30:56.44]I think that's fine for now.
[30:57.52]That's cool, though.
[30:57.98]You can do that.
[30:58.40]Alright, this is what I get at level 10.
[31:07.35]That's kind of a big deal.
[31:17.38]Don't disappoint.
[31:17.94]I got to try a few more games.
[31:19.93]Let me try LeBron again.
[31:22.15]We'll go in teams.
[31:22.97]I'm going to try LeBron again.
[31:25.51]I'm telling you, he's fun.
[31:27.01]He's funny.
[31:27.47]He's just kind of hard to play.
[31:40.62]No, I voted already.
[31:41.80]This is teams.
[31:42.62]I'll be alright.
[31:47.74]Jake is really good.
[31:59.23]Projectile speed.
[32:00.11]Alright, let's go.
[32:00.73]Come on.
[32:01.11]I'm telling you, I know how to play LeBron.
[32:02.59]I promise.
[32:06.87]That's a different character.
[32:07.95]Whatever.
[32:10.17]That's Finn.
[32:11.35]Jake and Finn from Adventure Time.
[32:14.51]What is this?
[32:20.52]Alright, he's going to eat the basketball, isn't he?
[32:23.22]A bunch.
[32:23.58]It's going to be bad.
[32:26.40]Jake the human and Finn the dog.
[32:28.78]I know.
[32:29.00]Alright, here we go.
[32:33.68]I'm going for it and it's going to be a good match.
[32:36.50]Check it out.
[32:38.40]I promise.
[32:38.82]I promise it's going to be a good match.
[32:45.34]I've already fucked it up.
[32:57.59]I must have fell off the fucking stage.
[33:12.02]What?
[33:13.34]How did he eat me?
[33:14.17]What's going on here?
[33:19.95]What just happened?
[33:22.17]Are you really powerful or just really lucky?
[33:24.65]Let her find out!
[33:38.36]Not bad.
[33:42.12]Whoa, I went across the map in a second.
[33:48.47]Something's going on here.
[33:49.47]Something's going on here.
[33:51.05]Sorry.
[33:53.47]My moves are for more than fighting.
[34:41.14]Get that Taz!
[34:45.57]No!
[34:47.39]Where are we?
[34:50.51]We did it!
[34:55.63]That was messy, but we did it.
[34:59.50]Okay, nice job.
[35:01.80]Good fight.
[35:05.52]Good fight.
[35:15.55]I got the kills that's all that matters all that matters is the uh the number at top nothing else does choose your character hey dude just tuning in is this guy a pro lebron what's up doc you tested me today and I understand
[35:42.03]Taz's spin is OP.
[35:42.95]I think they nerfed it.
[35:45.95]They made it way, way less powerful in the last patch.
[35:50.25]It's still really good, but not nearly as good as it was.
[35:59.67]It seems like they're really on top of patching the game every week or two, so that's good.
[36:06.11]That's good.
[36:06.99]Every week or two I see a new patch with nerfs and buffs and stuff, so that's good.
[36:17.86]Are they going to make it a cooldown move?
[36:19.00]That makes sense.
[36:26.63]It's only been one week.
[36:30.21]It's a lot of fun, though.
[36:37.92]Be really honest with me.
[36:38.78]How many of you guys have actually downloaded this and went like this on the couch?
[36:44.52]Fuck, it's good.
[36:46.54]Wait, be honest.
[36:47.54]Actually be honest.
[36:52.44]But I did.
[37:19.02]Alright.
[37:22.12]Oh my goodness, I just got absolutely double teamed.
[37:28.14]That move has no priority though.
[37:29.55]I mean, I get why it's so powerful, but you gotta catch people really off guard with it.
[37:40.41]You can pass the ball to your teammate too, which is really cool.
[37:42.89]Whoops, I didn't want to do that.
[37:44.31]Sorry.
[37:48.99]Oh my god, I thought it was over.
[37:53.84]I tried my hardest.
[37:55.48]It's alright.
[38:32.76]Jump into it.
[38:33.46]Shit.
[38:33.92]Blue team.
[39:04.68]Oh, you got so lucky.
[39:10.82]There we go, sir.
[39:13.42]Because you win in a fight against a grizzly bear.
[39:16.07]Yep.
[39:17.31]I think so.
[39:17.65]I think enough like
[39:28.93]You know like every beat-em-up sound you've ever heard?
[39:37.98]If the bear comes up with the claws, all I have to do is just go... And I'll be able to knock him down.
[39:54.20]Guys, I would die instantly.
[39:55.58]I would die in one hit.
[39:56.72]The bear would swipe me across the face and my face would come off.
[39:59.68]Of course I can't fight a bear.
[40:01.02]I'm kidding.
[40:01.50]It's a joke.
[40:06.54]I would get up with my hands like this.
[40:08.76]And then my whole head would be gone.
[40:17.11]But you can dodge an axe.
[40:18.25]Yeah, an axe is not a grizzly bear.
[40:20.71]An axe is not a...
[40:23.83]A person has to swing the axe.
[40:29.72]Alright, I want to do... Alright, LeBron or Bugs?
[40:38.16]You want to see more LeBron gameplay?
[40:41.87]He's so fun to play, he really is.
[40:43.77]I'm just not very good with him.
[40:48.61]LeBron means you'll lose.
[40:50.25]I just want to enroll LeBron on the team.
[40:55.22]I'll do LeBron again.
[40:56.46]Tom and Jerry.
[41:03.65]I tried to play Tom and Jerry.
[41:04.61]They were kind of weird.
[41:06.95]They remind me of the Ice Climbers, but you need to pay attention, essentially, to both Ice Climbers at the same time.
[41:12.33]It's like if you put the Ice Climbers away from each other and they both have different moves.
[41:17.90]My brain just has trouble doing it.
[41:19.00]They're cool, though.
[41:27.88]Should you purchase Multiverses?
[41:29.32]Well, Multiverses is free in open beta right now.
[41:32.74]Which, by the way, if you have a moment or two, this is a sponsored stream for Multiverses.
[41:39.33]The game is very good.
[41:40.81]I don't need to tell you that twice.
[41:42.97]It's currently in open beta.
[41:46.21]Cross-platform, cross-progression, all that good stuff.
[41:50.61]You know, you understand.
[41:51.57]Come on.
[42:00.03]Are there drops?
[42:01.97]I don't think there's any drops right now.
[42:04.13]They did that a couple weeks ago.
[42:08.16]Rain Dog is cute.
[42:12.22]I tried to play Rain Dog a little bit.
[42:13.42]I still don't understand how it works.
[42:14.52]Alright, I'm warming up.
[42:20.85]I'm getting into it.
[42:21.43]I'm warming up.
[42:22.83]We'll go back to 1v1s in a minute.
[42:29.01]Batman got nerfed too, right?
[42:31.17]Batman's Bataran got nerfed.
[42:56.18]Oh, that thing is weird.
[43:01.90]Oh, how did you get under that?
[43:03.46]Or over it?
[43:03.80]I mean... We're getting beat pretty bad here.
[43:31.69]I hit him.
[44:09.09]It's not good.
[44:09.73]It's not good.
[44:10.27]We're in trouble.
[44:13.41]Keep your eye on the ball.
[44:21.14]I think I'm getting even stronger.
[44:34.14]Oh my god.
[44:36.40]Defeat.
[44:47.79]We got destroyed.
[44:55.81]Did my mic just break?
[44:56.85]I feel like my microphone just turned off.
[45:03.06]Apologize to your teammate?
[45:05.98]I thought we were doing okay in the second half there.
[45:20.73]It's okay.
[45:21.65]We got it.
[45:22.13]We got it.
[45:22.55]We got it.
[45:22.91]Alright, we're going back.
[45:24.21]I'm going back.
[45:25.99]Let me claim some of these.
[45:27.61]I have some prizes, right?
[45:29.74]Ooh, prizes.
[45:35.64]Gold and... Oh, I definitely want to put that on.
[45:38.58]Okay, this is when somebody gets ringed out.
[45:50.03]Don't ever play LeBron again.
[45:52.73]How are you supposed to get better at something if you don't do it?
[45:57.50]That one's cool.
[45:59.38]Yeah, I definitely want this one.
[46:02.30]What's my banner?
[46:05.70]Should I do Deluxe Founder?
[46:07.82]But then people will think I'm good at the game or something.
[46:15.65]That's fine.
[46:16.61]Okay.
[46:17.67]Wait, what about Announcer?
[46:22.96]Who should I have for announcer?
[46:26.94]I can afford it.
[46:27.64]Should I do LeBron?
[46:35.61]Oh, okay.
[46:35.89]I thought it was 700.
[46:36.53]Alright.
[46:41.47]Let's go.
[46:46.00]Taz would be funny too, I think too.
[46:47.28]Okay, let's do it.
[46:53.60]Here comes the heat.
[46:56.32]OK.
[46:56.50]I'll buy Taz and maybe use it later.
[47:03.36]What does Taz sound like?
[47:06.09]Come on, pick character.
[47:09.93]Here comes the heat.
[47:12.67]Come on, pick character.
[47:16.63]What was it again?
[47:17.18]Last week people said that Taz doesn't talk.
[47:21.24]There he is talking.
[47:24.78]Alright, we're going to do LeBron first.
[47:33.65]Is that all he says?
[47:34.49]I'm going to laugh so hard if that's it.
[47:43.46]Please say here comes the heat again when we go to the next thing.
[47:49.15]I hope so.
[48:09.65]Look, he's so theoretically fun.
[48:11.91]You know what I mean?
[48:15.32]He's so theoretically fun.
[48:16.84]Here comes the heat.
[48:28.55]That's pretty funny.
[48:36.33]He's theoretically really fun.
[48:37.77]Show them what we got.
[48:40.62]I'm probably gonna get destroyed here again.
[48:42.16]Alright, I'm telling you right now, if you're voting and you're betting on me right now, don't.
[48:47.67]I'm gonna try.
[48:48.13]I don't... Tom and Jerry.
[48:51.69]Just gotta get rid of Jerry.
[48:54.77]Let's settle this on the court.
[49:10.72]He's got no priority.
[50:01.69]Come on, man.
[50:10.67]Didn't want to do that.
[50:11.93]Fucking move!
[50:35.05]No!
[51:39.20]I didn't want to do that!
[51:40.08]Not that way!
[51:40.98]We're good, we're good.
[51:47.08]Good match, good match.
[51:49.30]Did you just drown?
[51:53.09]I just like, came up with air from the water.
[52:10.72]It comes to heat.
[52:17.19]No, that was like my brain just got scrambled.
[52:23.47]Or LeBron, let's go.
[52:29.29]See, the only thing that was missing.
[52:31.73]Was they needed to be another me?
[52:35.80]Superimposed at half transparency.
[52:38.96]Looking around going.
[52:41.77]What do you mean no?
[52:55.10]How do you guys not understand what I'm talking about?
[53:02.56]Get on that, editors.
[53:05.28]Don't tell the editors what to do.
[53:11.76]Alright, let's go.
[53:15.28]I can just control smells.
[53:18.86]You in the Kings Court now.
[53:42.29]from you oh my god I can't even do a single god darn move oh my god
[54:33.25]Too late.
[54:44.14]Excuse me!
[54:44.72]I pressed every button on the fucking computer!
[54:47.58]Huh?
[54:54.67]Oh my god, dude.
[54:57.19]I can't do any moves without the basketball.
[55:00.89]Holy shit, man.
[55:07.50]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[55:14.15]Yeah!
[55:17.21]One for blue.
[55:20.55]Oh my god, I won!
[55:27.46]No I didn't.
[55:29.06]I told you we got this.
[55:36.93]I know, this isn't an episode of The Office.
[55:39.15]I don't know why I keep looking into the camera.
[55:43.69]It's like, what the f- You know- Nevermind.
[56:00.73]Accidental skill?
[56:04.20]Alright, no more LeBron for now.
[56:08.00]Let's do a new character.
[56:08.84]Let's do... Bug.
[56:15.55]Hey, you technically lost.
[56:16.57]Sorry, everyone thought I was getting destroyed.
[56:18.61]I was getting absolutely annihilated that round.
[56:21.56]But you bet on the wrong card there.
[56:24.24]Sorry.
[56:31.74]Alright, I promise after two matches with bugs, I will play another character that I haven't played before.
[56:40.72]You so badly want to be Jim from The Office.
[56:44.20]I've seen maybe four episodes of The Office total.
[56:48.72]I've never seen that show.
[56:51.04]In fact, I just watched a full episode of The Office one day when Ed Helms was the guy that was in charge of everything.
[56:57.69]And I was like, okay, this is one full episode I watched.
[57:08.51]That was a mistake.
[57:16.07]I think the problem that I have with the office is... Hold on.
[57:20.62]Steven Universe's theme song is here.
[57:23.80]Turn it up.
[57:28.06]Wait, let me turn it up.
[57:28.60]Let me turn it up.
[57:29.00]Don't hit me yet.
[57:29.46]Let me turn up the sound.
[57:40.29]Alright, we'll go, we'll go, we'll go, go, go, go, go, go, we'll go, go, fight, fight, fight, fight!
[57:43.23]Put it in my mouth!
[57:50.11]This cookie coming up!
[57:51.29]What the fuck?
[57:52.08]There's hair all over my fucking mouth!
[57:53.96]I swear to God, look!
[57:55.58]Can you see that?
[57:59.58]Special delivery!
[58:01.06]Sweet!
[58:01.62]Badda badda!
[58:08.50]Why did so much hair just get in my mouth?
[58:11.32]It doesn't make any sense.
[58:12.98]I went to the barber and they cut the hair in my mouth.
[58:16.65]I swear to god I have to take a break after this and spit it out.
[58:24.33]Okay, that was a major fucking distraction.
[58:49.14]How are there this many hairs in the fucking room?
[58:51.47]It doesn't even make any sense.
[59:01.29]Alright.
[59:10.38]This one doesn't count.
[59:11.30]This one doesn't count, actually.
[59:12.30]Yeah, that's three out of four.
[60:34.17]Goodbye.
[60:37.11]Alright.
[60:38.60]If I didn't have a handful of hair in my mouth and take 100 points of damage in the first 30 seconds, I would have been way more closer.
[60:46.76]Can somebody watch what happened?
[60:49.74]How did six hairs get in my mouth?
[60:53.29]How is it possible?
[60:54.85]What did I do?
[60:56.39]Did I put my hand in my mouth?
[60:58.88]When did my fingers go in my mouth?
[61:00.90]Ever.
[61:02.54]What happened?
[61:03.64]Does anybody know what happened?
[61:07.05]Did I go like... Did I like put my fingers in my mouth?
[61:09.63]When?
[61:10.81]That never happened.
[61:15.03]What happened?
[61:20.43]Yeah, I turned the volume up.
[61:23.22]But why would that put hair in my mouth?
[61:31.24]Let's go.
[61:32.40]Let's go.
[61:58.42]I don't get it.
[62:05.14]New character?
[62:05.56]I will, I promise.
[62:08.40]You're playing the worst character in the game.
[62:12.58]LeBron's not been up for that long.
[62:14.38]You don't know that yet.
[62:15.02]It was on the chapstick, wasn't it?
[62:25.17]Yep.
[62:27.07]Sure was.
[62:27.53]Because this is covered in hair.
[62:38.41]Does that mean it was just sitting on my lip the whole time until I like went like this?
[62:55.39]You put the chapstick in your armpit.
[62:58.51]By the way.
[63:00.16]Multiversus.
[63:00.84]It's in open beta right now.
[63:02.29]Go get it.
[63:03.53]The game is phenomenal.
[63:04.87]It's actually the best fighting game I've played in a long time.
[63:07.43]I don't even like fighting games.
[63:08.53]I really don't.
[63:09.85]I genuinely like this game.
[63:11.05]I've been playing it for like a week while I was sick.
[63:14.44]It's a great game.
[63:15.48]This is a sponsored stream.
[63:17.46]Let's go.
[63:30.29]Didn't want to throw the ball that way.
[63:31.77]You dodged that perfectly.
[63:36.87]Nice job.
[63:59.67]Yeah.
[64:31.33]Where's my ball?
[64:45.59]What's going on?
[64:47.95]What the hell is happening?
[64:50.06]I have a ball in my hand, why am I not using it?
[64:51.60]What?
[64:53.12]What happened?
[64:54.44]What?
[65:03.95]Where's my fucking ball?
[65:05.43]Something wrong with that?
[65:15.22]Fucking Jim from the Op.
[65:58.26]Ooh, nice.
[66:05.44]My moves are for more than fighting.
[66:35.96]This guy sucks.
[66:37.28]Why?
[66:38.14]I just won.
[66:44.26]Don't come in here and say this guy sucks.
[66:52.55]Don't say this guy sucks.
[66:55.39]You've only been here for five minutes.
[66:56.39]You don't know.
[66:56.76]You haven't seen my Bugs Bunny.
[67:07.81]Why are you moving like you're on Adderall?
[67:12.21]I don't know, because I've... What do you mean?
[67:16.16]What are you talking about?
[67:18.16]Time that person up for 15 minutes total.
[67:30.09]What do you use for shampoo?
[67:31.03]I use... Actually, it's changed recently.
[67:37.51]It's got shea butter in it.
[67:38.59]What's it called?
[67:38.99]I don't remember.
[67:42.29]Whatever one has shea butter in it, that's the one.
[67:47.39]New character?
[67:47.89]I need to level up LeBron James.
[68:11.38]show them what we got why are you the Xbox players so bad they're not most of the I was playing on Xbox and they were really good alright I'm going in for this one I'm gonna be quiet I'm not gonna do any like YouTuber reactions where I go like I'm just gonna play let's go let's I'll show it to you let's go this won't last long
[69:32.83]One for blue.
[69:36.61]Our stories aren't over yet.
[70:06.11]Alright, alright, alright!
[70:07.35]What'd you have for breakfast?
[70:36.54]green tea, and a burrito.
[70:40.04]Let's go!
[70:46.71]That wasn't bad.
[70:47.81]I think that was a good match.
[70:50.87]Here comes the heat.
[70:51.57]Alright, I'm going to have to stick with LeBron for this one, right?
[70:58.80]Game time, baby.
[71:04.23]Is it a breakfast burrito?
[71:05.95]It was a made up burrito, because I didn't have one.
[71:19.09]I had a piece of bread.
[71:26.28]Toast.
[71:27.38]Some butter.
[71:29.84]Coffee.
[71:31.84]And half of an avocado.
[71:37.79]Hey, you got nothing on my stretchy powers.
[71:44.74]You didn't know that it bounces back!
[71:46.40]By the jar.
[72:43.25]Aw, Jake is so fucking good.
[73:19.74]Come on, man.
[73:24.59]One for blue.
[73:27.87]Gotta shake it off.
[73:59.53]Keep y'all on the ball.
[74:35.49]Oh my god, I almost just caught him.
[74:48.77]Is Jake S'd here?
[74:52.89]I feel like he should be.
[74:59.29]All of Jake's moves are like a hundred feet around him.
[75:18.84]That's an easy 30k.
[75:19.96]Well, don't bet against me again.
[75:21.46]I'll tell you.
[75:21.90]Here comes the heat.
[75:31.32]Let Operation Rabbit begin.
[75:39.12]Which character should you pick?
[75:42.48]Whatever TV show you like the most.
[75:43.84]Because that's how you get the power to play well.
[75:50.75]See, if you play as a character which TV show you don't like, you don't care if you win or lose.
[75:57.18]But if it's a TV show you really like, you want Bugs Bunny to win because you love the Looney Tunes.
[76:01.64]That's why I always win with Bugs Bunny.
[76:18.21]Alright, let's go.
[76:18.65]You're about to have a bad head.
[76:27.15]What's going on?
[76:34.71]That's weird.
[77:11.81]Goddammit.
[77:15.53]Perfect plan!
[77:32.31]The perfect plan!
[78:05.88]These moves are all mine.
[78:07.90]God damn it.
[78:20.01]Oh, what a battle.
[78:20.99]What a battle.
[78:23.75]Yeah.
[78:25.03]One for blue.
[78:46.37]Why did that happen three times?
[78:47.74]Yeah, rabbits!
[78:49.06]Watch yourself.
[78:55.80]For the crystal gem!
[78:58.41]Ain't that a kick in the head?
[79:01.45]It's my lucky rabbit foot!
[79:45.61]stronger together.
[80:15.27]W-I-N.
[80:16.89]I told you we got this.
[80:18.49]Good fight.
[80:18.99]Good fight.
[80:19.65]Excellent battle.
[80:21.11]Excellent battle.
[80:26.32]Excellent battle.
[80:29.10]Play again?
[80:46.66]Someone just wrote in all lowercase, Steven Universe fucking sucks.
[80:56.05]Okay, have you ever seen the show?
[81:00.83]Have you ever seen that television show?
[81:04.44]You probably haven't even seen it.
[81:09.30]Here comes the heat.
[81:24.92]I don't even know what he does.
[81:26.65]Um, excuse me?
[81:40.14]He's fucking cracked out.
[81:41.37]Are you serious?
[82:00.58]Is he... Where is he on the tier list?
[82:02.25]You don't need... Who cares about tier lists?
[82:08.25]Actually, at least so far, I feel like a lot of characters are viable.
[82:11.18]That's what it feels like.
[82:11.78]Show them what we got.
[82:21.25]Except the characters I play, right?
[82:23.09]I play them because they're lower tier characters and that's why I lose like half the games.
[82:26.51]Alright, let's go.
[82:32.28]Oh, and he eats cookies.
[82:33.28]Yeah.
[83:07.56]Dude, you can skateboard?
[83:49.03]Don't get too greedy here!
[84:17.56]And hit somebody, man!
[84:18.80]You thought you had me.
[84:51.99]Here we go, here we go, here we go!
[85:44.72]Wait, I have a shield?
[85:58.49]What's going on with the internet?
[86:12.60]I told you we got this.
[86:20.89]OK, I'm thinking pizza party.
[86:24.81]Continue.
[86:27.65]He's actually kind of fun.
[86:28.31]I think he's pretty good.
[86:34.00]Let me go look at the.
[86:36.66]Hold on everybody relax.
[86:42.88]Let me go into the lab.
[86:50.73]Put on Taz.
[86:52.89]If I put on Taz, we're going to lose.
[86:54.23]Here comes the heat.
[86:54.89]I don't know if I want to do that.
[87:03.73]Alright, one more with LeBron.
[87:05.13]Is your username the name of your fursona?
[87:22.07]Here comes the heat.
[87:24.89]That's a good one.
[87:26.37]Actually good one.
[87:28.65]Alright, we got a mirror here.
[87:29.93]LeBron versus LeBron.
[87:31.85]No complaining this time.
[87:32.79]It's just who's the better LeBron.
[87:33.81]That's all that matters right now.
[87:43.04]Show them what we got.
[87:57.64]Okay, let's go.
[87:59.60]Back on Steven Universe.
[88:02.01]Alright, uh...
[88:34.48]Like on TV.
[88:35.00]Like a chump.
[88:36.34]Watch out.
[88:38.18]You want this?
[88:39.70]Heads up.
[89:03.54]Come on!
[89:03.99]Fucking hit him!
[89:04.93]Oh my god, dude!
[89:07.11]Alright, don't fucking tilt here.
[89:09.93]Just fucking wait.
[89:10.61]Come on.
[89:36.14]One for blue.
[89:37.52]Easy two.
[89:38.54]Big point for red.
[90:56.22]Oh, that would've been it.
[90:57.80]Damn.
[90:59.98]Whew.
[91:01.18]That was tricky.
[91:05.75]That was tricky.
[91:07.87]I got a couple of lucky bounces with the ball.
[91:26.74]You look really waxy today.
[91:36.80]This game is so gosh darn fun.
[91:42.39]We gotta do LeBron LeBron again, right?
[91:43.75]It's our work.
[91:44.57]It's pretty much our work.
[92:00.99]You do mouse and keyboard.
[92:01.93]I think you can, but I would not recommend it at all.
[92:09.31]Show him what we got.
[92:12.15]I will learn a new character after this I will.
[92:14.21]Alright.
[92:25.42]This is a good player.
[92:26.12]I gotta be careful.
[92:27.66]Let's play.
[92:31.00]Good play, good play.
[93:43.50]One for blue.
[93:45.90]Dig deep.
[93:57.92]Ooh, careful.
[94:00.94]Watch the anchor.
[94:04.56]Keep you out in the dark.
[94:14.22]Oh, that was a bad move.
[94:15.03]Hey!
[94:16.83]Oh, come on.
[94:45.32]Goodbye.
[94:47.44]Good fight.
[94:47.86]Good fight.
[94:48.30]Good match.
[94:53.82]Are you using a fight stick?
[94:59.37]No.
[95:01.53]Hey, to a fellow LeBron player.
[95:04.33]Good match.
[95:11.73]See, I just needed to warm up a little.
[95:16.57]Every time you talk, I grow more warts on my body.
[95:20.49]Sounds like a problem that... I don't know.
[95:22.56]What are you doing?
[95:24.44]Go to the doctor.
[95:25.06]It's got nothing to do with me.
[95:26.88]Alright, I promise one more game with LeBron and that's it.
[95:32.04]And then I'm going to go in the lab with another character and it'll be chat's choice.
[95:34.95]I promise.
[95:37.77]I promise it'll be done after this.
[95:39.29]100% promise.
[95:54.92]Here comes the heat.
[95:57.46]Stop giving that guy warts.
[96:00.68]So is it syllables?
[96:02.48]Is it my human voice with syllables?
[96:04.40]Because in that case... Good luck.
[96:11.08]They're all over your whole body now.
[96:19.91]Show them what we got.
[96:34.51]alright let's go I hope we all meet under better circumstances someday huh
[97:04.18]I have not very much experience playing against Superman, I'll be honest.
[97:26.64]Wrong way!
[97:27.62]I hate when that happens.
[97:28.82]It's so annoying.
[97:54.93]What the hell was that?
[97:59.29]One for blue.
[98:02.37]Watch out.
[98:30.91]Oh, God.
[98:31.44]Watch your head.
[98:34.03]Reflect.
[99:24.83]His hands are sweaty.
[99:25.76]Yes, they are very sweaty.
[99:31.70]Superman seems fun.
[99:38.87]Have you ever watched Adventure Time?
[99:40.09]Oh yeah.
[99:41.03]It was on Cartoon Network all the time.
[99:43.81]I was a fan.
[99:44.27]I thought it was a good show.
[99:53.05]That sounded dry?
[99:58.39]What do you mean, like... Name your favorite Adventure Time episode.
[100:05.96]Um... One where they have to go, uh...
[100:26.34]There's a dungeon they have to go through.
[100:27.76]That Lemongrab put them in.
[100:30.98]Or Lemongrab was there first.
[100:33.18]And they get to the end of the dungeon.
[100:34.34]Honestly, I just have flashes of animated sequences from that show.
[100:42.49]I don't remember episodes.
[101:34.20]Good job.
[101:34.68]Good job.
[101:35.24]Shit.
[101:45.61]I could do this all night.
[101:47.63]Try me.
[102:28.66]Bring some water.
[102:31.66]This stage is broken for LeBron.
[102:33.12]Yeah, it is.
[102:34.69]Just throwing the ball and not even caring about getting it back.
[102:38.67]This is the LeBron stage, without a doubt.
[102:42.31]Without a doubt.
[102:47.32]Also, the Scooby-Doo stage is really good for LeBron, too.
[102:51.34]Alright, new character.
[102:56.62]I will do a new character, I promise.
[103:01.53]I will.
[103:02.05]Here we go.
[103:03.97]By the way, Multiversus is in open beta right now.
[103:07.75]You can go get it.
[103:11.07]Steam.
[103:12.30]Xbox.
[103:14.90]Wait, what is this?
[103:16.46]Here comes the heat!
[103:19.06]Yeah, thanks Warner Brothers again for sponsoring this stream.
[103:23.52]Honestly, this is... I'm really happy because I actually genuinely love this game.
[103:28.15]I think it's awesome.
[103:30.69]I am so happy to be playing this game because it's very good alright who do you who do you want to see me play let's put it out there alright let's do a poll I'll give you guys a top four who I would actually like to learn
[104:00.54]Velma.
[104:04.64]Superman.
[104:13.66]Finn.
[104:19.95]Or Batman.
[104:24.83]Let's get a pull up.
[104:28.00]Who do you want me to play with?
[104:29.64]I will unlock any of them.
[104:34.45]In the meantime, yeah, I'll put the announcer on.
[104:38.79]Ooh, what's this?
[104:41.07]A sticker?
[104:41.53]I can't even see who's winning.
[104:56.30]Who's winning?
[104:58.31]I love this song in particular.
[105:01.29]You know, the music in this game, especially the main menu, it reminds me of being at, like, Six Flags.
[105:09.16]Right?
[105:09.60]And you hear that music just playing everywhere.
[105:11.48]You get a corn dog.
[105:13.94]It feels very amusement park-ish.
[105:16.30]I love it.
[105:21.28]I feel like I'm in the line for the Superman ride.
[105:25.62]You know what I mean?
[105:27.85]I love it.
[105:32.52]Let's get a new emote.
[105:36.80]Wonder Woman weightlifting.
[105:38.90]OK.
[105:47.23]Alright, I've got an 80% recent win rate.
[105:49.63]This is pretty good.
[105:58.60]I'm only 2,189,000.
[105:59.92]Look at your Bugs Bunny rank.
[106:03.78]How do you do that?
[106:04.24]Alright, it looks like it's Velma.
[106:12.71]How do I see the 1v1?
[106:13.49]Alright, let's take Velma into the lab.
[106:38.55]Alright, so Velma's got a couple of cool moves.
[106:42.35]Her basic attack is ranged.
[106:46.18]So you have to target somebody and then you can just kind of pop, pop, pop, pop.
[106:50.90]And that's on cooldown.
[106:52.44]Alright, let's see.
[106:55.39]Velma shouts a word bubble projectile that seeks out her ally.
[106:58.53]If the bubble hits any fighter, ally, or enemy, they become targeted, and additional bubbles will lock onto their target, their location.
[107:05.13]Allies who become targeted will also briefly gain hastened.
[107:08.37]Alright, so that's a support move.
[107:12.42]So it's a heal.
[107:15.80]Alright, so the ammo will just replenish itself.
[107:18.34]Uh, side X is a combo of quips.
[107:22.12]Yeah, that move is good too, this one here.
[107:24.78]I honestly think that's the best combo in the game.
[107:31.14]It's got such insane range.
[107:33.75]Look at the range on this.
[107:35.83]Like, that's insane.
[107:39.89]You can't get away from this.
[107:44.91]Takes a long time to charge up that shit, so I'm not going to do it too much.
[107:47.67]Okay, what about down?
[107:48.23]Yeah, this is the...
[107:51.59]Whack.
[107:51.83]Okay.
[107:53.71]And the idea.
[107:54.31]Bubble.
[107:58.27]You know what you really can do to screw with somebody?
[108:01.33]So you get them in the air.
[108:03.33]And then just start throwing these out there.
[108:05.40]And just pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, boom.
[108:06.96]Okay, cool.
[108:10.02]I like the combos.
[108:12.64]What about the air moves?
[108:15.10]Whoa, that's pretty good.
[108:18.48]That's just okay.
[108:19.06]Cool.
[108:21.60]This one's like a dive.
[108:23.52]It's got a lot of bounce to it.
[108:28.18]And you can charge this too.
[108:34.92]That is a stuff move.
[108:36.30]If you got somebody going around the corner here and you just stuff right there.
[108:39.08]Okay.
[108:42.22]What about specials?
[108:42.82]So that... Okay, so you got to collect these things, right?
[108:46.41]What does it do?
[108:49.57]Motivational speech beam projectile that repeatedly hits enemies and heals allies.
[108:54.01]Alright.
[108:54.85]The final hit of the beam applies targeted.
[108:57.67]If the final hit lands on an ally, it will fire an additional beam.
[109:01.24]Okay.
[109:04.18]Or if it hits the full stack, they get weakened.
[109:06.02]Okay.
[109:08.72]You can aim the beam up or down.
[109:09.84]So it's just like a... Okay.
[109:12.84]What is this one too?
[109:15.14]What is this?
[109:16.50]Here we go.
[109:19.26]Yep.
[109:21.07]Is there a cooldown on that?
[109:25.21]There is no cooldown on that.
[109:33.17]So, dude, alright, target.
[109:35.69]Watch this.
[109:37.86]Oh, I screwed it up.
[109:38.60]You know what I mean?
[109:39.20]I think that would be a pretty cool combo.
[109:43.20]It may not.
[109:47.36]It's the flashlight.
[109:48.44]Okay, cool.
[109:49.08]So that's what that does.
[109:50.40]You carry them over to the edge.
[109:54.15]Allies can hop into the arms too.
[109:56.63]Increasing attack power.
[110:01.07]Toxic goop on the ground and jumps upward.
[110:03.49]Enemies standing in the goop will receive continuous stacks of ice.
[110:06.05]Okay.
[110:09.49]Or it's... You snap a picture.
[110:16.05]Velma snaps a picture downward with a camera that sends her enemies upward.
[110:20.97]Breaking armor applies weak.
[110:24.49]Really?
[110:24.79]That seems... What's the range on it?
[110:28.13]Alright, that seems insane.
[110:43.68]That's a kill move.
[110:44.36]Okay.
[110:49.55]So that throws ice on the ground if you're not in the air.
[110:51.99]So I gotta remember that.
[110:53.07]Down is spread the knowledge.
[110:54.39]Projectile that homes over an ally.
[110:58.37]You get educated if the book hits them, reducing the duration of their cooldowns.
[111:01.64]Okay, so when everything's on cooldown, you just kind of throw the book down.
[111:06.22]Alright, I think I'm ready.
[111:09.42]Give it a try.
[111:09.82]I think I'm good to go.
[111:13.94]Wait, is there anything else to look at?
[111:17.61]Oh, right.
[111:17.95]During the match, evidence will appear and some of Velma's moves spawn evidence.
[111:22.60]So you can pick it up.
[111:23.62]You fill the evidence meter.
[111:25.96]So when the meter is full, Velma can call a police car.
[111:28.14]The police will seek out the nearest enemy, disable them, and drive off the map.
[111:35.61]We'll do this while crouching.
[111:36.87]How do you activate that, though?
[111:38.25]That seems insane.
[111:38.83]Alright, let's do it.
[111:39.33]Let's do some Velma gameplay.
[111:47.63]She calls the cops.
[111:48.83]Yeah.
[111:51.87]We'll do 1v1.
[111:52.25]Here comes the heat.
[111:58.30]I forgot about Taz.
[112:07.32]Come on, pick character.
[112:09.88]Look out, monsters.
[112:11.30]Velma's here.
[112:20.91]Also, again, if you play the game, all your progress is kept through open beta.
[112:34.12]Stop doing your funny voice.
[112:35.28]I didn't do anything.
[112:42.61]Okay, let's see if I can make anything happen here.
[112:44.21]Headphones going in.
[112:51.67]start time alright gaming time gaming time well this is going to be exciting
[114:06.93]Oh shit, I forgot I had that move.
[114:36.75]What the fuck are you going?
[115:10.77]Alright, let's go!
[115:26.21]What the fuck is happening?
[115:27.95]Why can't I leave the stage?
[115:33.21]I can't get off the stage, man.
[116:12.50]I almost got him.
[116:13.50]I think I almost got him.
[116:15.82]Alright.
[116:20.14]Seriously, what the hell is going on?
[116:22.72]What's actually happening?
[116:24.72]Why do I have so much... Dude, you could go buy a boat with the amount of money you have right now.
[116:56.50]Jump off?
[117:00.70]I wanted to get to a thousand and I'll jump off.
[117:14.13]What?
[117:14.59]It can't go more than a thousand.
[117:16.47]What?
[117:28.78]We good?
[118:23.81]I think that was a little out of the ordinary.
[118:25.97]I don't think that one counts.
[118:28.31]1100 damage.
[118:29.15]I don't think that's possible.
[118:56.56]I don't have enough.
[119:00.82]Sure, I'll take it.
[119:26.82]What do you mean votes immediately started to go to no after you picked LeBron?
[119:29.74]Start time!
[119:36.36]Fine.
[119:36.72]Let him do it.
[119:37.50]Let him vote that way.
[119:40.82]That's fine.
[119:41.30]Let him vote that way.
[119:44.57]The believers.
[119:47.59]Get ready, because this biz is about to get redone.
[119:50.21]Spam!
[120:08.70]Oh, he didn't even dodge!
[120:29.34]He didn't even dodge!
[120:30.18]What was that?
[121:18.02]Should have shot up.
[121:25.22]Oh my god, Finn, you are fucking disgusting.
[121:55.15]No, he can just... What the hell?
[122:41.57]You can block that shit?
[123:43.03]You know what's wicked funny?
[124:11.09]When I play a game, this happened in Smash Bros.
[124:13.03]2.
[124:14.39]Whenever I played against somebody that destroyed me, and I thought was a potentially powerful character, it made me hate their fucking TV show.
[124:26.80]Or their game.
[124:29.14]This happened in Smash too.
[124:30.98]I would get dominated by an Olimar, and I'd be like, fuck that game, that game sucks.
[124:37.18]No one even likes that game.
[124:39.46]It would make me genuinely not like the media that it came from.
[124:43.63]So right now, I like am never watching Adventure Time.
[124:48.23]Ever.
[124:49.15]I'm going to skip it every time it's on TV.
[124:55.84]Come on, pick character.
[125:11.58]It's so good.
[125:12.24]I know, but you know what I mean?
[125:13.00]Okay, if I was getting destroyed by a Bugs Bunny, I'd be like Looney Tunes.
[125:18.12]Not watching that show.
[125:25.37]Let's see.
[125:25.93]Oh, here we go.
[125:26.47]Alright, this is a Jake.
[125:29.01]Is this going to solidify?
[125:30.19]I'm never going to watch Adventure Time because of this?
[125:35.68]Oh, shit!
[125:36.56]I completely forgot.
[125:39.27]I was going to go get a bunch of big carrots.
[125:43.82]And every time I won with bugs, I was going to take a huge bite of a big carrot.
[125:47.64]That was a mistake.
[125:48.42]I fucked up.
[125:51.28]I completely forgot to go to the grocery store and get it.
[125:57.32]Who's ready for a bite?
[125:58.86]Me, dude.
[125:59.86]Me.
[126:07.66]Where did that go?
[127:03.89]I snapped back in the ass.
[127:07.87]You'll get a kick out of this one.
[127:31.09]Alright, fucking come on, man.
[127:32.46]How many goddamn moves do you have?
[127:35.29]Fuck this show.
[127:36.97]I've never watched this on Netflix.
[128:31.56]Heads up, dude!
[128:34.07]Whoa!
[129:12.82]I just want to thank Lady Rainicorn.
[129:16.18]Play again?
[129:16.92]Come on.
[129:21.57]Come on, show.
[129:23.03]Nobody fucking watches.
[129:33.81]I'm kidding.
[129:34.49]It's a great show.
[129:53.81]It's a great television show.
[129:58.15]You gotta do an apology video.
[130:08.81]I actually do like Adventure Time.
[130:11.61]It's just, okay, so I told you, if I play a fighting game and I get destroyed, it makes me hate that piece of media.
[130:20.79]You need to apologize to Finn and Jake directly.
[130:34.64]Start time!
[130:42.92]You gonna hate Batman?
[130:43.98]No, I don't hate Batman.
[130:44.88]Uh-oh.
[130:48.16]Well, it depends.
[130:49.06]How badly do I get beaten this match?
[130:51.95]We'll find out.
[130:53.39]Batcave's security system must be compromised.
[130:56.55]Pick up.
[131:32.07]Stupid.
[131:32.79]That was so stupid.
[131:34.91]I did not expect him to get hit by the goddamn ball.
[131:43.49]We're good.
[131:45.21]We're good.
[131:45.53]We're good.
[131:45.79]We're good.
[131:46.25]We're good.
[131:46.57]We're good.
[131:46.89]We're good.
[131:47.32]Fucking Batman.
[131:52.40]Superman's way cooler anyways.
[132:10.52]Auto man.
[132:49.34]Goddammit, my mind's not in the game.
[133:09.39]My head wasn't in the game.
[133:10.51]My head was not in the game.
[133:19.76]I made a lot of mistakes at the end there.
[133:22.36]I'm here to fight for truth and justice.
[133:32.81]That's what he sounds like.
[133:46.85]Was that Superman talking?
[133:48.54]Who was that?
[133:49.02]Alright, I thought that was Batman talking.
[133:58.25]I was like, that's not the same voice.
[133:59.47]I don't know why I thought that was Batman.
[134:01.79]I was like, that's... No, he doesn't.
[134:09.14]Start time!
[134:17.54]OK, now the voice is completely make sense.
[134:19.32]I just don't know why Batman was the one talking and I'm like this doesn't really sound like this.
[134:26.65]Superman, I'll beat you without kryptonite.
[134:53.22]oh they actually talk to each other
[135:35.36]Should've gone up.
[135:44.01]Should've gone up.
[135:44.51]What an idiot.
[136:24.20]Oh, what a colossal fucking battle.
[136:27.14]What a colossal battle.
[136:31.60]Shit.
[136:48.86]What the hell is going on here?
[136:53.75]Ah, but it went down
[137:23.54]Stop talking shit to me!
[137:26.39]I feel like you're in my chat!
[137:58.59]That was your character.
[138:00.00]I... Whatever.
[138:01.48]I keep thinking it's Batman.
[138:03.00]This is a fun game, I'm telling you.
[138:20.37]I'm so sweaty.
[138:23.60]Superman's really tanky.
[138:25.96]Very heavy.
[138:40.00]Let's do it again.
[138:41.62]How come you look like you made it a soap?
[138:43.75]I don't know.
[138:48.41]I don't know.
[138:49.65]Do I?
[138:49.87]It's kind of weird.
[139:02.15]I gotta stop.
[139:02.95]Okay, my biggest problem with these games is panic dodging.
[139:09.01]I get up there, we get in the air, and I just go, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, and I gotta stop doing that.
[139:15.46]The panic dodges are what's getting me killed.
[139:19.26]Are you gonna play anything else tonight?
[139:30.01]Probably not.
[139:31.31]Probably not.
[139:33.46]We'll come back with we'll come back with sorcery in.
[139:38.65]Couple days, maybe on Monday.
[139:40.09]I completely forgot I played the hitman map.
[139:46.27]That's weird.
[139:51.23]Could have walked away.
[140:31.74]Oh, I thought I got him.
[140:41.51]Blow point!
[140:47.09]Blow point!
[141:00.35]Really powerful.
[141:28.17]Actually powerful.
[141:29.91]His moves just hit so hard.
[141:41.43]How come you went live when I went to the movies?
[141:44.31]Because we were trying to get a stream in before you showed up.
[141:59.26]That was rude.
[142:00.66]I'm just messing around.
[142:01.68]Of course I want everyone that's here to be here.
[142:05.70]It's me making a joke.
[142:07.97]As long as I'm standing, you can count on me.
[142:10.49]Oh, when's green?
[142:10.99]Okay, green screen part two movie night is going to be on next weekend.
[142:15.03]We're probably going to go on Friday or Saturday.
[142:17.97]So the 5th or the 6th?
[142:19.15]Let me check the date.
[142:22.21]It'll be the 5th or the 6th.
[142:23.87]We'll come back with another probably 1 to 200 videos.
[142:25.37]It's going to be insane.
[142:29.23]And then Sorcery, we'll do some more of Kare.
[142:31.69]That'll be on Monday.
[142:34.15]Maybe we'll do Monday, Tuesday.
[142:36.71]Maybe we'll do Monday, Tuesday, Friday.
[142:39.15]Or Monday, Tuesday, Saturday.
[142:40.12]If that makes sense to me.
[142:44.38]Do you have a face filter on?
[142:54.45]No.
[143:01.04]I've not seen a Harley Quinn in a long time.
[144:13.22]Oh, almost.
[144:20.22]I'm goner.
[144:20.78]I'm a goner.
[144:22.40]Red point!
[144:25.48]Red point!
[144:26.53]You sure you don't have powers, Harley?
[144:36.05]Full force!
[144:39.21]Low point!
[144:40.17]Low point!
[144:58.59]Oh, shit.
[144:59.45]Nice dodge.
[145:29.10]Damn, I got outplayed too, I really did.
[145:32.62]I actually got outplayed that whole entire game.
[145:35.02]I just got a couple of good smashes, that's it.
[145:38.00]Okay!
[145:40.20]Come on, pick character!
[145:55.73]He seems like he's pre-recorded.
[145:58.08]We'll do Taz.
[146:04.08]Didn't I own Taz?
[146:10.22]Did I not own Taz before?
[146:11.28]I have level three.
[146:19.57]Here comes the heat.
[146:20.81]That's like where you think.
[146:23.03]Ha ha ha.
[146:25.64]Oh, it's the free character rotation, right?
[146:27.28]That makes sense.
[146:35.77]I think you might be stupid enough to be a Taz main.
[146:41.21]Funny guy.
[146:57.92]Kaz is low tier now.
[147:00.41]Really?
[147:01.23]I don't think so.
[147:51.53]How did I fuck that up?
[147:53.86]Yeah!
[147:58.28]One for blue.
[148:40.87]Nice.
[149:08.22]Holy shit, what happened?
[149:12.94]That was ridiculous.
[149:13.80]What happened?
[149:17.99]Just went flying.
[149:19.51]That was insane.
[149:26.11]I don't think I did that much damage.
[149:36.92]You know what?
[149:37.70]It's fun to sit here and just play a video game.
[149:40.60]And just try to play it well.
[149:42.61]I feel like it's been forever since I've tried to do this.
[149:45.87]I feel like it's been ages since I've cared to play a game and try to play it well.
[149:52.27]Does that make sense?
[149:52.89]Does anyone else feel that way?
[149:53.63]Or am I just getting old?
[149:57.67]Elden Ring?
[149:58.25]Yeah, I mean multiplayer though.
[149:59.83]Playing against somebody else.
[150:07.47]I'll do it again.
[150:20.60]I'm not going to play this game competitively ever.
[150:23.80]I never will.
[150:25.18]But I can't wait to watch the people that do.
[150:29.92]Especially the teams.
[150:31.54]There's no way they're not going to do some kind of interesting stuff with the game, right?
[150:35.23]There's no way.
[150:37.40]I'm looking forward to watching this game.
[150:45.59]Oh, alright.
[150:59.34]I hope it's successful.
[151:00.04]It's really great game.
[151:02.14]I do, too.
[151:02.86]I hope it's successful as well.
[151:05.57]I mean, it's going to come down to how much support the game has in the next six to 12 months.
[151:12.97]Looks like it has a lot.
[151:16.17]I mean, wasn't this one of the most played fighting games ever on Steam?
[151:20.01]I remember seeing a screenshot.
[151:22.41]Am I wrong?
[151:22.87]Ooh, that smells something tasty.
[152:31.16]Alright, alright, alright!
[152:34.57]Yeah!
[152:34.75]One for blue.
[153:10.96]Good combo, good combo!
[153:21.91]Oh, you're almost a snack!
[153:24.11]You're almost a turkey!
[153:27.23]Turkey!
[153:51.91]Ooh!
[153:53.13]Oh shit, I'm almost a turkey.
[154:10.02]W-I-N.
[154:18.33]I told you we got this.
[154:19.76]Can the turkey attack?
[154:20.58]Nope.
[154:21.60]It can just run around.
[154:28.20]Tasmanian Andy.
[154:46.55]I thought that was a good match.
[154:47.57]I did.
[154:47.85]I thought that was a good fight.
[154:55.01]Here comes the heat.
[155:05.40]Adventure time.
[155:10.43]I move around a lot.
[155:11.41]I do.
[155:11.67]I know.
[155:16.37]When I play games like this, I have to move around.
[155:19.52]The game is inside of me.
[155:33.56]Batman feels low tier to me.
[155:35.97]Is that wrong to say?
[155:36.69]I feel like Batman doesn't have very many moves.
[155:42.33]Doesn't feel high tier.
[155:44.01]Am I wrong?
[155:46.11]He has trouble killing.
[155:53.10]At least in 1v1s.
[155:53.56]Show them what we got.
[156:04.20]Batman is top, you are ass.
[156:05.34]You know what I mean?
[156:07.40]Why do you have the screen turned off?
[156:13.40]You really think you're the toughest I've gone up against?
[156:55.01]I tried to get it.
[157:31.16]One for blue.
[157:33.44]I could do this all night.
[157:35.44]Try me.
[157:37.00]W-I-N.
[157:40.54]I told you we got this.
[157:47.36]What a performance.
[158:02.98]I was getting juggled a lot too.
[158:08.58]Is there a campaign mode?
[158:09.94]I don't think there is a campaign mode.
[158:12.94]Not that I'm aware of.
[158:13.50]How come he always looks so upset?
[158:31.59]I mean, I'm locking in gamer-wise.
[158:34.97]Is that what it is?
[158:35.67]You know, Holly said this to me too.
[158:38.75]She's like, no, seriously, like if you watch you play a game that you're really, really focusing on, it looks like you're going to headbutt the screen.
[158:46.80]I'm just like, what?
[158:47.44]I just sit there like, I have to focus.
[158:58.52]Why is your chat so weird?
[159:01.33]I don't think they're that weird.
[159:02.25]I mean, some of them are.
[159:18.16]I wanted it so bad.
[159:22.22]Press the fucking button.
[159:32.42]Big point for Red.
[159:35.49]Time to use a little strategy.
[160:31.31]We both want the same thing, man.
[160:32.69]It's not gonna happen to either one of us.
[160:34.07]Damn!
[160:46.42]Oh, I'm in trouble.
[160:55.94]I'm in trouble.
[160:56.41]I'm in trouble.
[161:05.17]Oh, I almost got it.
[161:16.62]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[161:30.87]I told you we got this.
[161:38.19]That was a huge hitbox.
[161:39.39]Yeah, it was.
[161:41.69]I'm having more fun watching you hop around in your seat.
[161:51.54]I get really into this shit, man.
[161:53.90]I'm sorry, I really just do.
[162:02.85]But it feels good to play.
[162:07.62]Writing games always play like such ass online.
[162:10.54]It's just, I've never even cared.
[162:13.01]I've never cared to even play one.
[162:14.49]Because I'll jump into online and it's like, why would I ever do this?
[162:17.75]This sucks.
[162:19.23]It doesn't feel like that.
[162:19.89]This game does not feel like that at all.
[162:21.29]It just doesn't.
[162:22.11]I have to be upfront.
[162:23.64]Let's be honest.
[162:27.52]I'm here to fight for truth and justice.
[162:48.27]The netcode?
[162:48.90]Yeah.
[162:49.32]It's really hard to do it.
[162:51.98]I mean, look, there's been some times where the game's been a little laggy.
[162:54.90]Teleporting around and weird shit happening.
[162:57.46]But I would say 90, probably like 80 to 90% of all the games that I've played in this game, I've played pretty normally.
[163:05.44]As if I was sitting next to the person that I was playing against.
[163:10.07]So that's encouraging.
[163:18.19]And honestly, the servers are getting hammered right now.
[163:22.11]This just went into open beta.
[163:29.31]There are a ton of people playing this game.
[163:33.74]So it's holding up pretty well.
[163:41.81]Alright.
[163:42.35]Alright.
[163:42.75]Okay.
[163:42.99]Alright.
[163:43.35]Okay.
[164:23.32]Oh shit, did I hit it back at him?
[164:40.19]Damn it.
[164:41.93]Coming at ya!
[164:42.61]Yeah!
[164:46.33]One for blue.
[165:05.44]yikes nice kick nice kick that was a good play that was a good play it was
[166:03.54]What are we doing?
[166:07.46]Alright.
[166:07.70]Alright.
[166:07.98]Pull it together.
[166:08.50]Pull it together.
[166:08.99]That freaked me out.
[166:20.64]Oh my God, that was so scary.
[166:28.13]Bugs is getting nerfed in a week.
[166:29.83]That's alright.
[166:30.57]He's really strong.
[166:32.35]Bugs is very strong.
[166:37.52]Look at Finn on that nerf too.
[166:46.44]Play Tom and Jerry?
[166:53.86]Actually, Finn is probably in a good place.
[166:57.06]I would imagine.
[166:59.52]They probably just need to bring a few people up, I think.
[167:06.57]Genuinely?
[167:07.21]I can't think of a character that I think is not worth playing.
[167:12.33]I don't think so.
[167:14.99]I mean, maybe LeBron feels a little weak.
[167:19.16]But he's a brand new character.
[167:22.76]Who is genuinely terrible?
[167:24.38]I don't think there's anybody that's genuinely awful.
[167:28.61]Raindog?
[167:33.67]Is this character not great?
[167:36.01]Wonder Woman sucks?
[167:37.53]Really?
[167:37.81]On teams though, Raindog is probably really good.
[167:50.72]Aria feels really interesting too.
[167:52.30]I want to try Aria.
[167:52.68]Serial L'Rell.
[167:53.24]Steve is not good either.
[168:21.08]It is fun to play.
[168:25.22]She's busted if you know what you're doing.
[168:30.37]Show them what we got.
[168:40.33]Steve.
[168:40.87]Oh yeah, Steve.
[168:44.21]Ma'am, I should have learned better catchphrases.
[169:10.61]I just let you do that.
[169:19.37]Alright, what did that do?
[169:34.28]My head hurts from that.
[169:35.26]What happened?
[169:35.82]That just hurt my brain.
[169:47.85]Holy shit!
[169:54.23]Do you do anything besides unmask fake spirits?
[170:28.74]I don't even know what I'm doing.
[170:32.26]OK.
[170:32.42]She seems fun.
[171:08.57]Alright, I can do some team games.
[171:14.95]I've been doing all 1v1s.
[171:16.23]I'm obsessed with 1v1.
[171:17.53]Oh, I got some unlockables.
[171:27.65]Hold on.
[171:31.94]A new banner.
[171:32.52]Alright, this is a good Harley Quinn.
[171:43.37]I gotta prepare myself.
[171:44.61]This is a good Harley Quinn.
[171:52.52]Show him what we got.
[172:10.51]You guys are fucking hilarious.
[173:21.48]They're going for red!
[173:24.75]Right.
[173:58.64]I'll make this look easy.
[174:05.78]One for blue.
[174:10.09]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[174:10.83]I need that.
[174:20.35]Really?
[174:22.47]Come on, man.
[174:36.48]Really?
[174:36.78]It broke the shield?
[174:38.22]Oh my god.
[174:40.96]It's not impossible.
[174:44.57]It's not impossible.
[174:53.43]It's not impossible.
[174:54.35]It isn't.
[174:55.41]It's impossible.
[174:58.27]I felt a little laggy.
[175:09.24]Here comes the heat.
[175:31.46]I'm here to fight for truth and justice.
[175:36.06]Did you even try?
[175:39.51]No, I just, I literally just like was trying to touch my tongue, my nose.
[175:45.87]And I focused on that more than the game.
[175:48.71]That was my mistake.
[175:49.45]I shouldn't have done that.
[175:51.03]So I'll focus this time.
[175:52.03]I'll try this time.
[176:07.97]I'm warning you, I don't have an easy mode.
[177:23.13]Alright, alright.
[177:25.92]Took me by surprise, Harley.
[178:02.32]Let's go.
[178:03.44]Let's go.
[178:04.76]Let's go.
[178:10.90]That was a good fight.
[178:11.54]Good fight.
[178:12.35]Change it up on the Harley.
[178:13.83]Change it up.
[178:14.41]Okay.
[178:17.91]Are we going to get a character switch?
[178:21.25]Or am I going to get dunked on by Harley?
[178:24.06]I wonder.
[178:24.32]Here comes the heat.
[178:29.38]I'm gonna say Superman.
[178:31.34]Should you fall, I'll catch you.
[178:38.19]Okay.
[178:51.89]Do you think this game will have the three stooges?
[178:54.43]Does Warner even own the three stooges?
[178:57.62]I don't think so.
[178:59.42]But, I mean, could be.
[179:06.74]Alright, this is it.
[179:09.31]This is for the marbles.
[179:36.75]Alright, alright.
[180:07.82]Whoa, that was weird.
[180:29.13]Don't make me do this.
[180:31.19]Sorry about this.
[180:42.03]Oh, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[180:45.63]W-I-N, I told you we got this.
[181:15.73]Superman's launch moves are unbelievable.
[181:20.62]They're so good.
[181:23.64]They're actually cracked out.
[181:31.60]Man.
[181:37.01]Good fight though.
[181:37.61]Good match.
[181:38.81]That was intense.
[181:40.91]I can feel it.
[181:41.43]I'm like nervous.
[181:44.26]It's that gamer feeling, you know what I mean?
[181:48.36]Here comes the heat.
[181:50.79]You were popping off.
[181:51.51]You should probably main Superman.
[181:52.65]You think so?
[182:21.19]God, Superman's moves just feel great to do.
[182:24.85]When you're in the air and you just go like, you just do that huge right-handed punch.
[182:57.48]What's the last game that I played off stream?
[183:00.77]Fall Guys.
[183:01.21]I played it for like 10 minutes.
[183:04.57]Alright, let's see if I can do some work here.
[183:14.50]Show them what we got.
[183:19.63]Why?
[183:19.91]Because it was free and it was on Xbox, so I just downloaded it for no reason.
[183:26.45]And speaking of downloading a video game, Multiversus is in open beta right now.
[183:34.75]If you want to do gaming skills like this, oh, check it out for real, actually.
[183:38.61]Actually, check it out.
[183:39.15]It's a great game.
[183:40.21]Actually, phenomenal fucking game.
[183:48.87]I don't even know what that does.
[184:26.31]Went over his head.
[184:27.01]Didn't catch it, come on.
[184:46.40]Wrong way.
[185:14.67]That backfired.
[185:20.11]Yeah, it did.
[185:42.78]Man, I love winning.
[185:45.52]You look thirsty, dude.
[185:50.25]Dude, you look thirsty.
[185:56.63]Here comes the heat.
[186:06.04]Oh no, I can't afford it.
[186:08.80]As long as I'm standing, you can count on me.
[186:17.10]Get the mustache hair again?
[186:18.16]Probably.
[186:18.52]I didn't... He peed his chair.
[186:28.33]I did not pee my chair.
[186:33.78]He for sure peed his chair.
[186:43.20]Did you get a haircut?
[186:43.94]No, I didn't.
[186:45.86]A while ago I did.
[186:47.16]Oh, it's Jake.
[187:05.62]Big point for Red.
[188:21.55]What the hell keeps happening here?
[188:39.64]What the hell?!
[188:41.66]Dude, he went off the goddamn screen!
[188:43.90]He went into the skybox, for god's sake!
[188:54.42]Every time he does that move, the whole game turns on.
[188:57.08]I'm so confused.
[188:58.78]That was so stupid.
[189:20.84]Dude, why is my double jump?
[189:23.50]Something's funky.
[189:27.42]Yeah!
[189:28.32]One for blue.
[189:30.45]Just gotta think.
[189:49.23]Shake it off.
[189:50.25]We're only getting started.
[189:57.22]Never watching this show ever again.
[189:59.14]We've got some major partying to catch up on.
[190:03.22]Let's go!
[190:11.74]Here comes the heat.
[190:22.10]what if life nothing but simulation the show dude the show ended years ago I've never watched it on TV when it comes on TV ever again
[190:38.76]Can you please stop shitting in my garden?
[190:40.22]I don't care if you're fertilizing the crops.
[190:43.41]It got, it got, that message got removed, so enjoy your five minute time out.
[190:51.98]Alright, here we go.
[190:53.58]You gotta get some mouthwash, dude.
[191:54.61]Yeah!
[191:55.51]One for blue.
[191:57.86]That's good.
[192:28.34]What happened?
[192:29.88]That was weird.
[192:58.77]Here comes the heat!
[193:01.76]Open beta.
[193:02.98]Cross-progression.
[193:04.22]Cross-platform.
[193:05.64]LeBron's in the game.
[193:06.72]You can get it right now, go download it.
[193:10.26]MultiVersus.
[193:12.87]You can look up pretty much anywhere, wherever you can get it.
[193:24.22]Why do I keep going back to LeBron?
[193:25.84]I don't know why.
[193:27.68]I keep seeing the potential of playing with LeBron and we're going against a Finn.
[193:33.67]I'm literally snapping all my Adventure Time DVDs in half after this.
[193:36.47]Show them what we got.
[194:03.30]Alright, come on.
[194:04.54]This is a map for LeBron, by the way.
[194:07.03]Actually a map for LeBron.
[194:55.09]That's the first time I've seen that happen.
[195:09.22]It's been pretty rock solid so far.
[195:16.82]Dude, bro is flabbergasted.
[195:21.83]Dude, bro is flabbergasted.
[195:25.78]I do look like it's sweaty, don't I?
[195:26.88]Is this the same person?
[195:31.97]No.
[195:59.61]Madam Tussauds wax statue version of Jerma.
[196:07.00]It's hot in here, man.
[196:53.38]I think I'm hitting gamer fatigue.
[197:23.97]One for blue.
[198:17.30]That gamer fatigue is settling in.
[198:46.34]How am I still on the stage?
[199:00.76]Oh my goodness.
[199:01.40]Ugh.
[199:01.58]Alright.
[199:16.74]Superman is amazing.
[199:18.34]But I'm definitely hitting gamer fatigue.
[199:21.68]We're going to do some team fights.
[199:23.23]Is the next stream Monday or Tuesday?
[199:31.68]Next stream is going to be Monday.
[199:32.48]Here comes the heat.

[200:23.23]Same person.
[200:31.70]When is baseball?
[200:32.42]Baseball is August 19th.
[200:36.20]You're going to start to see a lot of marketing, I would say.
[200:41.05]Don't worry, we're going to hype it up.
[200:43.63]You'll see some marketing for it.
[200:45.87]Marketing in quotes, right?
[200:48.48]PR Andy, that's right.
[200:53.64]August 19th.
[201:29.51]You don't have enough money!
[201:35.70]One for blue.
[202:03.22]I promise I'm trying to do the other moves.
[202:50.01]Alright, let's do a few relaxed team ones, maybe some free for all.
[203:20.07]There were some good games.
[203:21.15]I got absolutely diarrhea-ed on in the first half hour playing.
[203:27.38]I got into it though.
[203:28.58]We played some really good players though.
[203:32.66]Looking forward to putting on the director's commentary for Adventure Time Season 3 DVD Special.
[203:51.89]10 toasts.
[203:52.43]That's cool.
[203:52.67]Alright, let's do some stuff.
[204:03.47]Let's do some cool stuff.
[204:04.61]Let's do some free for all some teams.
[204:07.13]I'm gonna say Superman.
[204:15.88]Should you fall?
[204:16.76]Genuinely, Superman is awesome.
[204:27.18]before I forget though like I play this game and I think it's fun and Warner Brothers actually is just like yeah we'll sponsor you that's just cool I'm really happy about it I'm glad that it's a game that I really like to play I actually enjoy it so thanks again for sponsoring the stream seriously really really cool
[204:52.93]Can you jump six times?
[204:53.79]Yeah, sure.
[205:13.82]Uh-oh.
[205:21.89]Oh, we got a perkless Steven Universe and an almost perkless Superman.
[205:27.21]We're in trouble now.
[205:30.31]Or maybe not.
[205:30.71]My voice is like so dry.
[205:32.08]You're right.
[205:32.52]Who said that earlier?
[205:33.40]Somebody said, dude, your voice is wicked dry.
[205:36.88]They were right.
[205:37.82]It sounds like kind of terrible.
[205:40.38]I'm like, hey, what's happening?
[205:42.26]Why does it sound like this?
[205:43.10]Alright, let's do it.
[205:45.94]Come on, Steven.
[205:46.55]Oh.
[205:56.85]Watch out for that smoke.
[206:41.51]and grab him?
[206:42.17]What?
[206:48.45]Get out of here!
[207:01.98]Oh, I almost had it.
[207:03.06]I almost had it again.
[207:03.80]That would have been so sick and I'm terrible.
[207:13.82]How did I not hit you?
[207:17.68]What the fuck?
[207:18.94]Get the fuck- Oh my goodness!
[208:01.19]I forgot where I was in the screen.
[208:03.57]This fucking Harley Quinn.
[208:05.07]Oh my god, dude.
[208:06.51]I... Get out of here!
[208:20.87]What just fucking happened?
[208:28.30]I just flew in the air!
[208:29.30]Alright, let's do it again.
[208:31.30]Let's do it again.
[208:38.90]That got all messed up.
[208:50.27]I couldn't even do anything.
[208:53.83]I missed with every single goddamn swing.
[208:56.94]Alright, we're going fucking LeBron.
[208:58.82]I'm pissed.
[209:21.64]visually overwhelmed yeah that's what when you play these games for long enough uh just colors just start to I I can't tell the difference anymore after about three to four hours my brain's just kind of like alright I need to do I need to like look at a wall or something
[209:53.24]They switched up their mains, did they?
[209:57.56]Oh.
[210:00.06]They went Garnet.
[210:01.44]It was Steven Universe before.
[210:02.61]Alright, let's make it happen.
[210:03.71]Let's go.
[210:04.53]We can make it happen.
[210:09.59]Let's do it.
[210:10.31]Alright, let's go for it.
[210:23.67]Okay, you ready for a show
[211:02.45]Where's the priority on that move?
[211:13.78]I didn't hit?
[211:16.80]Come on, man.
[211:20.96]I'm so confused.
[211:21.86]Well, I didn't do that.
[211:33.57]Whoa!
[212:20.75]Watch that zone!
[212:21.75]Watch that zone!
[212:22.81]Oh, alright.
[212:24.63]Sorry.
[212:24.85]Sorry.
[212:49.98]Oh, that would have ended it.
[212:57.64]Your lack of morals is troubling.
[213:23.68]Good fight.
[213:25.44]Good game.
[213:26.70]Good game.
[213:27.24]Seriously.
[213:37.33]Good game.
[213:37.75]Well, it's not over.
[213:38.37]We got one more.
[213:40.45]We got to go for the real deal, right?
[213:49.73]Do you know who LeBron is in real life?
[213:55.28]No, I have no idea.
[213:58.14]I have no idea who one of the greatest basketball players to ever live is.
[214:01.20]I don't know who that is.
[214:02.88]Never heard of the guy.
[214:06.66]Do I stay LeBron?
[214:13.40]I don't know.
[214:14.78]Yeah.
[214:17.44]You're rolling with the king now.
[214:25.99]Alright.
[214:30.19]Do you even know who Steven Universe is in real life?
[214:42.54]Show them what we got.
[214:59.62]Alright, we gotta win this one.
[215:01.64]We don't have to do anything, right?
[215:03.70]We're gonna try.
[215:14.23]No!
[215:16.03]Oh, that's so anticlimactic.
[215:18.19]That was the climactic part.
[215:19.36]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[215:22.58]Unfortunate.
[215:25.62]Unfortunate.
[215:28.29]Alright, we'll do one more.
[215:30.55]We'll do one more.
[215:38.22]One more.
[215:41.68]And that's it.
[215:47.18]Just do a free-for-all.
[215:49.08]I'll do a free-for-all after this.
[215:50.32]If it doesn't get picked.
[216:04.43]Ray, a rain dog.
[216:10.23]Yeah, my kryptonite in this game is Finn and Jake from Adventure Time.
[216:34.25]I can handle the bugs.
[216:36.37]I can handle the Batman.
[216:37.65]I can handle Harley Quinn.
[216:40.07]Can I handle Finn and Jake?
[216:42.95]They're killing me.
[216:53.38]I wonder what my record is against Finn's and Jake's.
[216:55.96]It's probably pretty low.
[216:58.52]Back to the lab.
[216:59.16]I gotta figure out why.
[216:59.94]Alright, come on, Raindog.
[217:02.04]Let's do it.
[217:42.90]Alright, hold those bombs still.
[218:15.16]Oh, I almost had it.
[218:19.99]You got two of those?
[218:20.73]What happened?
[218:21.19]What?
[218:31.26]Nobody wants to go near each other.
[218:48.73]We good?
[218:56.74]What the fuck is happening?
[219:00.59]Okay.
[219:01.55]Get out of my zone.
[219:04.07]Game Baxter.
[219:24.57]Oi!
[219:24.89]Dude, how come he's got two of those?
[219:39.22]What is up with that?
[220:01.53]Good match.
[220:04.67]Good fight.
[220:05.21]It's a bug?
[220:06.74]You know, I've lost.
[220:23.86]I think I've only lost maybe, what, five times total?
[220:27.60]Six or seven times?
[220:28.28]I've won probably 10 to 20 games.
[220:30.86]What's the record today?
[220:31.74]I feel like this has been pretty good.
[220:33.16]The game's been great so far.
[220:34.10]You can check.
[220:38.40]I'll go check in a minute.
[220:42.82]This will be the last one.
[220:56.55]Check your profile.
[221:00.91]83% win rate.
[221:10.50]Oh, thanks for the perks.
[221:13.44]Definitely that one.
[221:22.69]I want that one.
[221:23.41]I want all defense.
[221:24.33]No, no, no.
[221:24.67]We want... Yeah.
[221:35.32]Yeah.
[221:35.70]So after Multiversus... Well, not after Multiversus, but on Monday.
[221:41.16]We'll go back to Sorcery on Monday.
[221:45.05]And then Tuesday, maybe we'll do that again.
[221:47.65]Friday, we're going to do green screen movie night part two.
[221:50.89]Definitely want to show up for that one.
[221:53.05]It's like another 150 plus videos to watch.
[221:57.47]So that should be fun.
[221:59.99]And then baseball's August 19th.
[222:01.60]We got a lot of shit going on.
[222:03.68]August 19th.
[222:04.08]Alright, let's go.
[222:08.18]You're more powerful than you look, aren't you?
[222:28.14]I got caught in that.
[222:28.90]Damn.
[222:33.19]Oh my goodness.
[222:34.25]He almost just eliminated me.
[223:07.17]You motherfucker!
[223:09.79]Get rid of him!
[223:20.84]How did that not hit?
[223:22.48]Dude, this guy seriously keeps throwing us up.
[223:52.39]Dude, he's just throwing them around.
[224:21.25]Alright, get this brain dog.
[224:22.12]Get the brain dog.
[224:23.34]Oh, shit.
[224:23.84]Oh.
[224:24.66]Crap.
[224:48.84]Of all the rain dogs, you're the rain doggiest.
[224:53.14]It's all good.
[224:54.52]It's all good.
[224:57.37]Let's go!
[224:59.59]That Superman just kept on grabbing the fin and just tossing him.
[225:02.57]He got me once with it, too.
[225:04.65]Sneaky.
[225:05.05]That's sneaky stuff.
[225:07.33]He just kind of grabbed and then, boink!
[225:12.70]Excellent choice.
[225:24.59]Alright, this is it.
[225:28.25]After this, I'll see you guys on Monday.
[225:30.09]I've had a lot of fun, though, and sponsored or not, I'm probably going to keep playing this.
[225:37.19]I don't know why I would stop.
[225:39.23]I think this is a good thing just to, you know, kill a couple hours.
[225:48.95]Just jump in here for an hour or two every so often.
[225:52.61]I think it'd be fun, especially when they start adding new characters.
[225:54.92]I don't want to play them.
[226:01.26]Not all the time, but I mean, whatever I get into it, I get into it, right?
[226:06.44]Let's get it.
[226:37.69]Bro, I have no more escapes.
[227:11.04]Oh, one of us is going down there, man.
[227:15.60]Oh, come on.
[227:16.66]Alright, we got to tie it up.
[227:18.30]Go, go, go, go, go.
[227:45.25]Don't make me do this.
[227:56.91]Oh, that didn't hit.
[228:10.13]Alright, we're good.
[228:11.87]One for blue.
[228:28.27]don't let him I freaked myself out I freaked myself out I freaked myself out I freaked myself out I freaked myself out why did I do that I freaked out I freaked out oh my god I freaked out we were we were winning I just oh I freaked out I had a shitload of damage I I freaked out I freaked out
[228:52.33]It's like jumping in Mario when you jump to a ledge and then you jump again when you made the ledge and you just fall to your death.
[228:58.35]Ugh.
[229:01.99]Yeah, I'm not gonna end on a loss.
[229:04.27]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[229:13.59]I don't know why I did that.
[229:14.77]I just, I threw the ball and the ball was gone.
[229:27.35]You look pale because this webcam is a piece of crap.
[229:32.63]And it's like the most expensive webcam you can possibly buy.
[229:35.33]And it's worse than the one I had before.
[229:38.76]And it overexposes you and you can't do anything about it.
[229:41.38]It's literally the worst webcam I've ever used.
[229:43.18]It's a skill issue.
[230:01.15]Use a DSLR?
[230:02.47]I don't... I don't... I don't care.
[230:06.19]I don't want to set up a big camera pointed over here and have the room heat up even more.
[230:10.28]Alright, let's go.
[230:29.32]Bro, I'm serious.
[230:30.60]What is going on with my guy?
[231:08.42]Don't do it again!
[231:14.14]Don't do it again!
[231:16.20]I almost had it again.
[231:51.87]That was a lucky shot.
[231:54.97]Crystal gems!
[231:57.34]Cool, man.
[232:00.64]I'm, like, still here.
[232:29.74]No, no no no no no no This is for you
[233:03.06]This guy's just spamming his down smash move, and it's freaking me out.
[233:09.13]Look, and he's just doing the down move, and it's freaking us both out.
[233:11.57]We can't do anything with him.
[233:15.51]Get out of here.
[233:17.97]Oh.
[233:18.19]He's just going like this.
[233:20.27]He almost did it, too.
[233:22.01]Oh, my God.
[233:22.73]That was so close.
[233:25.61]Oh, my goodness.
[233:26.33]That's a good strategy.
[233:27.45]That was seriously ridiculous.
[233:34.43]Alright, this is it.
[233:41.25]This is the end.
[233:43.85]Alright.
[233:44.09]We good?
[233:48.02]Final one.
[233:48.86]This is it.
[233:57.74]I'm gonna try as hard as I can and I'm gonna try to win.
[234:10.19]Show them what we got.
[234:11.65]Don't throw, don't throw.
[234:15.03]That's asking a lot.
[234:16.43]You know what channel you're on.
[234:18.98]Is there a channel where we do that stuff?
[234:25.64]Please be on Steven Universe.
[234:27.18]Okay.
[234:32.60]I'm done talking.
[234:33.86]Let's play.
[234:43.87]Okay, I don't know what happened.
[234:46.33]I'm serious.
[234:47.19]I think I lagged out of the screen.
[234:49.01]I didn't press that button.
[234:50.44]It's alright.
[234:50.80]We're fine.
[234:51.26]We're fine.
[234:51.52]We're fine.
[234:51.82]Relax.
[235:08.04]It's a really bad start for both of us.
[235:09.56]I don't know.
[235:12.28]My game fucked up.
[235:26.76]Oh no.
[235:28.61]Oh no, this was a disaster.
[235:30.19]This was a disaster.
[235:36.81]Wait, that was an absolute disaster.
[235:46.81]I don't even know what happened, man.
[235:49.49]We just, there's the same players.
[235:51.43]What, what happened?
[235:52.87]What even just happened?
[235:55.71]More like the world's greatest everything.
[236:00.58]Alright, this is I mean, come on, man.
[236:05.12]This is the final round.
[236:06.10]What the hell happens?
[236:07.15]I'm seriously shook up over this.
[236:10.11]It comes to heat.
[236:17.26]I knew I should have taken that left pointed Albuquerque.
[236:24.41]I slam dunked off the screen.
[236:29.81]Whatever.
[236:34.51]Oops.
[236:45.22]OK.
[236:46.76]Let's go.
[236:56.43]Show them what we got.
[236:58.14]I'm going as hard as I can.
[237:00.32]I'm going full volume.
[237:02.20]I'm warning you.
[237:12.01]I'm not gonna look at chat.
[237:13.17]And it's Steven Universe's theme song.
[237:14.45]It's Steven Universe's map.
[237:15.21]It's the best map in the game.
[237:16.73]Well, if it ain't Wonder Woman.
[237:18.62]I was wondering when we were gonna meet again.
[238:03.42]Well that was an improbable little fool in the time stream.
[238:12.75]I refuse to surrender.
[238:14.49]On target.
[238:35.44]On target.
[238:44.98]Justice will come for you.
[238:47.98]Who came for defenses?
[238:50.90]On target.
[238:52.62]Time to use a little strategy.
[239:00.24]Big point for Red.
[239:06.00]You thought you had me.
[239:07.32]Yeah!
[239:08.54]One for blue.
[239:12.00]Back in action.
[239:19.11]Behind me!
[239:21.33]End of the line.
[239:42.33]We're good.
[239:44.47]Good match, good match, good match.
[239:50.60]That's a good one to go out on.
[239:51.44]Good work.
[239:52.38]Oh yeah, no.
[239:52.92]Good battles, good battles.
[240:12.55]Alright.
[240:14.27]That was a lot of fun.
[240:18.39]When you get into a rhythm, the game becomes just like fluid, you know, like water.
[240:22.17]It's just like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, down, boom, up, down, down, down, down.
[240:30.47]The game's great.
[240:32.19]This stream was sponsored by Warner Brothers.

[241:51.59]I'm just kidding around.
[241:52.63]I don't hate that show.
[241:55.52]I was kidding.
[241:56.00]It was a joke.
