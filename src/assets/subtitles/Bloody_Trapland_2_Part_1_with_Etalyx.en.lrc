[00:12.07]And here we go.
[00:15.11]Here we go.
[00:17.35]Oh.
[00:20.01]That's because we must have both pushed the button at the same time and they picked mine over yours.
[00:31.74]I've had that happen before.
[00:32.66]You just have to like push stop and then start again.
[00:35.79]You know, it's like a computer.
[00:36.71]It's like being an IT guy.
[00:38.87]Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
[00:48.69]okay we'll be here hey okay that was weird apparently apparently I was live for about six minutes and Twitch is just like no you know you aren't you just aren't and restarted and here we are good afternoon good evening hi
[01:13.00]We're early today.
[01:15.06]We're early by about 30 minutes.
[01:17.30]Because we're doing something today.
[01:19.08]I know you guys are looking for Spore.
[01:21.36]But you ain't gonna get Spore tonight.
[01:24.03]Me and Etalyx are gonna play Bloody Trapland 2.
[01:27.37]That wasn't even funny.
[01:34.27]Like, why did I think that was gonna be funny?
[01:35.75]It wasn't.
[01:37.05]Like, everyone just thought, like, oh, ow, oh, he burped funny.
[01:39.47]No.
[01:39.57]No, it wasn't funny.
[01:41.15]I wasn't trying to be funny, but I was.
[01:42.63]Like, shut up, Jeremy.
[01:43.61]You know what I mean?
[01:44.05]Like, fuck you.
[01:45.67]Um... So, I mean, Italic's gonna play Bloody Trapland 2.
[01:49.35]Apparently, it came out in early access.
[01:50.82]Like...
[01:53.01]Today, apparently.
[01:54.53]So, we did not expect that at all.
[01:57.64]You'll get Spore on Tuesday, and you're going to get the movies on Friday of next week.
[02:02.72]I promise.
[02:03.96]I promise.
[02:06.38]You're going to get the movies Friday.
[02:10.28]This next Friday.
[02:12.55]And that is a Jeremy Stevenson guarantee.
[02:21.16]Or maybe not.
[02:22.25]You know, it just might not happen.
[02:23.47]Because I might actually have to fly.
[02:25.13]Well, I got a guarantee.
[02:27.43]Absolute guarantee that within the next two weeks you'll get the movies.
[02:30.60]Because I might actually be flying to Los Angeles this next weekend.
[02:34.38]So, I might as well just make that clear.
[02:37.46]That my word means absolutely nothing.
[02:43.06]But you guys, you know, whatever.
[02:44.52]It's all good.
[02:45.40]And by the way, I'm writing a book.
[02:46.86]Can't wait for you to read it in like six years.
[02:48.86]Anyways, Talc is going to be with us.
[02:49.96]He's going to be joining us.
[02:50.56]We're going to move to Baladagi Trapland 2.
[02:53.59]And we'll see how good it is.
[02:55.47]Here comes the music.
[02:59.59]Alright.
[02:59.97]Ding, ding.
[03:00.57]Ding dong.
[03:00.97]How are you?
[03:03.26]I'm doing great.
[03:04.46]I feel good.
[03:05.30]I got my blood pumping.
[03:07.67]Is your blood going?
[03:08.07]And I'm ready to die.
[03:09.13]Yep.
[03:09.89]Good.
[03:10.19]I hope your blood is boiling right now.
[03:13.21]I'm ready to spill my blood everywhere.
[03:17.47]Good.
[03:18.75]Is your stream good?
[03:20.29]Yeah, everything is... Yes, I am live, unlike someone I know.
[03:28.79]Alright, so should we explain what Bloody Traplin is?
[03:32.90]Do I want to?
[03:33.76]Yeah, you know, you do.
[03:34.76]Give us a good introduction, Etalyx.
[03:36.50]By the way, Etalyx, go watch him, go follow him.
[03:38.88]He's a good guy.
[03:41.56]Bloody Trap Land is a game from... We played it in 2014.
[03:44.57]Yes.
[03:46.53]And it's a game up to four players, online co-op.
[03:50.23]It's a dumb-looking side-scroller, but it's really fun.
[03:54.05]It is very, very fun.
[03:55.15]Like, if I'd never played this game before, and this is the first thing I saw, I think that this looks like a bad game already.
[04:01.35]And you can do things like this.
[04:05.85]You can jump on your friends!
[04:08.39]You can do things like this!
[04:09.37]And it makes a lot of blood.
[04:11.43]And the blood spills everywhere on the map.
[04:13.63]So the whole point of the game is just to platform in co-op while sometimes hurting your friends.
[04:19.33]And the levels just get progressively harder.
[04:21.67]You gotta remember there's like secrets here too.
[04:26.01]Oh yeah, you can't be jumped on when you crouch.
[04:28.48]I forgot about that.
[04:29.34]You can just do a little see-saw.
[04:32.20]But I think there's, like, new gameplay mechanics now.
[04:34.10]Alright, so we can't... Here's the thing.
[04:36.38]First of all, hold on a second.
[04:38.20]I'm gonna turn the music down.
[04:39.12]It's a little too much.
[04:39.76]A little too much.
[04:42.32]That's a good idea.
[04:43.26]Yeah.
[04:43.74]Okay, so... Do you want to give ourselves a little bit of a... A little bit of a challenge here?
[04:48.29]No... Zero deaths?
[04:51.53]Well, we've already kind of screwed that up.
[04:53.27]Oh, by the way, Etalyx is the green one.
[04:55.39]I'm the blue one.
[04:56.11]We probably should have made that clear.
[04:58.13]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[04:59.55]I'm the green one.
[05:00.78]Yeah.
[05:01.32]Did I say you were the blue one?
[05:03.18]No.
[05:03.58]Okay.
[05:04.08]Well, let's go.
[05:04.48]You're good.
[05:05.72]We beat the level.
[05:07.77]It would be nice if there was a little username on top, I guess.
[05:10.19]Well, what is happening?
[05:13.78]I think it does a replay of every death in that level.
[05:19.00]Oh, okay.
[05:19.46]Like, say it takes 150 deaths, there'll just be fireworks of blood at the end of the level.
[05:23.64]Oh, God.
[05:24.12]Alright, no deaths.
[05:25.78]Well, then I can't jump on you.
[05:27.28]Yeah, but that doesn't count.
[05:28.30]Like, no environment deaths.
[05:31.35]Okay.
[05:31.71]Don't get grabbed by the Super Mario.
[05:32.69]But what about the coin?
[05:34.19]We'll get the coin.
[05:35.41]Okay.
[05:37.18]No deaths.
[05:38.50]I want to see if you can do this.
[05:39.92]How do you go over there, though?
[05:41.87]I think you have to do the little double glide thing, right?
[05:44.05]Can I push you?
[05:47.59]I think I can double jump you.
[05:50.35]That doesn't count.
[05:51.25]That doesn't count.
[05:51.97]No, that's not an environment death.
[05:53.78]That's a goofy Etalyx killed me death.
[05:55.78]I was just jumping.
[05:57.88]Like...
[06:02.50]We didn't start counting yet.
[06:03.58]No, we didn't start the counter yet.
[06:06.69]Starting now.
[06:07.55]No, no, no, wait, wait.
[06:08.39]Starting yet.
[06:08.97]Starting now.
[06:10.27]Right.
[06:10.57]Starting right now.
[06:11.25]Starting right now.
[06:14.21]Look, it was splitting it with the bush.
[06:15.97]It was not my fault.
[06:18.73]How do we get that?
[06:19.65]How do you do the glide thing?
[06:21.07]Square?
[06:22.71]I figured it out.
[06:23.65]For me, it's trigger.
[06:26.16]There's multiple buttons.
[06:28.70]I did right trigger.
[06:30.36]Oh, okay.
[06:32.24]Let's finish this easy level.
[06:34.02]Starting now, no deaths.
[06:35.68]Uh-huh.
[06:38.66]Zero deaths.
[06:39.38]We got it.
[06:41.29]We were just trying to figure out the game controls.
[06:46.29]Those ones don't count.
[06:48.43]Wait, what?
[06:52.45]There's like NPCs in this game?
[06:56.86]Don't exit.
[06:57.70]I almost just touched that one.
[07:00.20]Don't touch that one.
[07:00.99]It's because it's right here on the ledge.
[07:06.01]There's a button down there.
[07:07.25]A conspicuous red button.
[07:10.43]Shoot the gun.
[07:12.17]It's just a gun.
[07:13.43]That's all it is.
[07:14.45]What about Pepe Le Pew over here?
[07:18.85]Why is he behind the door?
[07:20.07]I don't know.
[07:21.89]He's gone now.
[07:22.45]I think we had a time limit.
[07:25.73]I think we may have had a Pepe Le Pew time limit there.
[07:32.23]Starting now.
[07:32.65]No, but it's still like trying to get the controls.
[07:34.73]You were trying to figure out how to hit that button.
[07:36.95]It was part of the controls.
[07:38.67]This is the fucking tutorial.
[07:40.59]This is not like... It is, yeah.
[07:42.80]It hasn't even started yet.
[07:57.65]Thank you The first two today's are the tutorials this is without we don't even can start counting till we get like through then understand like how the controls work Yeah
[08:16.66]There's spikes there.
[08:17.96]This is the tutorial.
[08:21.08]I thought you could swim.
[08:25.78]I thought you could swim.
[08:26.78]I really did.
[08:27.67]Wait, wait, wait.
[08:28.45]What's the glide button?
[08:29.45]How do you do like the kiddie glide?
[08:30.67]It's right trigger after you jump.
[08:35.53]What?
[08:36.47]So what does this thing do?
[08:38.32]Oh, look at that.
[08:40.16]How do you do that?
[08:41.78]I just ran and hit the trigger.
[08:45.10]Shit, okay There we go What'd you do?
[08:50.30]Okay?
[08:50.52]So you don't have you don't you can just walk off the ledge?
[08:53.44]Oh the jump?
[08:54.70]Okay, you don't have to jump you can trigger We're not gonna do any deaths and remember when I got a fucking skip on the skip
[09:11.50]Wait a minute, why?
[09:11.94]What does this mean?
[09:13.16]My eyes are already watering.
[09:15.20]Secret.
[09:15.46]I don't know what that does for us.
[09:17.58]I hope that secret brings me to, like, a checkpoint.
[09:19.75]Oh, dude, that's like in Mario when you get to, you know, like, the castle?
[09:22.63]Oh, it just goes to the next level.
[09:24.55]Or, like, to the end level or something.
[09:25.97]I think there might be, like, there's a step.
[09:27.59]No, no, look, it's a secret area.
[09:28.71]Because, look, see?
[09:29.51]Remember in Mario World, Super Mario Bros.
[09:31.70]for Super Nintendo?
[09:32.84]When you went to, like, the Boo Castle and you went in the other direction, you took the key card and you swiped it and you got to, like, the other area of the map?
[09:40.34]Yeah, like when you go up to the tip top of the screen and Mario's like off the screen.
[09:44.12]Mm-hmm.
[09:45.06]Yeah.
[09:45.62]Alright.
[09:45.84]That's pretty awesome.
[09:46.62]Let's do it.
[09:49.13]T1.
[09:49.59]Ooh, look at this one.
[09:52.33]No deaths.
[09:53.01]Okay.
[09:54.61]Watch out for the laser.
[09:55.87]Yep.
[09:56.11]There's also spikes next to you?
[09:57.73]Yeah.
[10:02.71]Yep, the laser.
[10:03.91]It's following you.
[10:04.99]So I think one of us has to go up here.
[10:07.55]God.
[10:09.66]Okay, so I'll hold the laser down.
[10:14.90]And then what?
[10:16.92]It comes back.
[10:18.66]Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[10:20.10]Can we go up?
[10:21.24]Yeah, there's... There's definitely a way to just skip around here.
[10:27.60]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what you gotta do.
[10:29.73]So you go up there.
[10:31.87]So ready?
[10:32.31]Go up there.
[10:33.93]So you climb up there.
[10:34.69]Here, jump on my head.
[10:40.13]I don't know.
[10:41.31]I don't know.
[10:41.93]So, you jump.
[10:43.15]Okay, good.
[10:44.49]What?
[10:44.85]How did I die?
[10:48.53]What is killing me?
[10:49.33]I'm not dying by anything.
[10:51.06]I'm walking into the gun.
[10:51.66]I'm jumping on your head.
[10:52.36]Oh, no.
[10:53.48]There's a laser.
[10:59.23]Let's be adults about this.
[11:00.41]Alright, are we wearing diapers right now?
[11:05.19]Are we children or are we grown men, Italian?
[11:07.15]Are you a grown man?
[11:08.89]I don't know.
[11:09.71]You look like a grown man with your top hat and monocle.
[11:12.85]I'm going to sit here and I'm going to hump the wall.
[11:15.82]You go for it.
[11:16.52]Go, go.
[11:17.92]Look where the laser is right now.
[11:20.22]I get it.
[11:20.68]You want me to go right?
[11:22.42]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11:24.02]There's a way to go up and around, though.
[11:25.60]Go, go, go, go.
[11:29.96]third level.
[11:32.20]I wonder if the secret level to be fair.
[11:34.53]Hang on.
[11:34.83]Hang on.
[11:35.81]There's got to be a way around this.
[11:37.57]We just have to make it past the fish and someone has to.
[11:42.05]It's really smart, though, Jerma.
[11:44.57]I mean, you got to figure this.
[11:45.51]You got to get it locked in here.
[11:48.03]But yeah, how can you can't like stay on the wall?
[11:51.85]You know what I mean?
[11:52.27]Like if I try to stay on this wall, I can't.
[11:57.52]Like, you can do that, but you can't do it on the other wall.
[12:02.39]Okay, hold on.
[12:03.49]Just stay here for a second.
[12:04.45]What's the idea?
[12:05.83]See, watch.
[12:06.25]See what I'm talking about?
[12:07.07]Like, you can't really stay on that wall.
[12:08.55]It's whichever one's closest to you.
[12:10.41]So, like, whichever one of us is closest to the laser, that's the one that it tracks.
[12:15.31]Okay, so if I stand right here, it's not going to track you.
[12:18.77]So we need to move very slowly together.
[12:21.85]Okay.
[12:22.53]Oh, wait.
[12:23.05]You almost had it, I think.
[12:24.97]There's no...
[12:30.43]I think one of us does have to be, like, on the outside one.
[12:33.81]Like, on the left.
[12:34.81]This secret area is really tricky.
[12:37.23]Did you have, like, eye frames or something?
[12:40.10]Where's the laser right now for you?
[12:41.40]Oh, there it is.
[12:41.82]Alright, you can go outside again.
[12:45.68]Well... Let's try the outside thing one more time.
[12:50.94]Alright.
[12:52.29]Oh my god.
[12:54.88]That it's funny now how long before that just gets annoying that's gonna get annoying very quickly One of us has to like go in up there.
[13:03.00]I'm ready cubby up there ready, but we can't say one go Go see how it's like There's got to be a way I
[13:21.50]The way that I'm thinking is one of us has to just stay up there.
[13:25.20]You know what I'm talking about?
[13:26.42]But you can't keep your character up there.
[13:33.41]Alright.
[13:34.81]What?
[13:35.39]Did you... We'll come back to it.
[13:40.39]That was a really cool secret.
[13:41.43]That was a great little secret level.
[13:43.15]Alright.
[13:43.43]Let's just... Look.
[13:43.87]No...
[13:45.91]I was gonna say the D word.
[13:47.39]I was just gonna say the D word, but I didn't.
[13:48.73]Okay, well, you hadn't said it yet, so it didn't start until at least now.
[13:53.33]Oh, it's starting now.
[14:00.17]Oh, this is gonna get even harder.
[14:02.72]That's the thing.
[14:03.22]Yeah, it is.
[14:06.82]Alright, what are we going for?
[14:07.64]Is there a secret button up here?
[14:08.72]There's a secret button up here.
[14:09.84]Oh, it's probably to unlock this thing.
[14:11.56]Alright, I got it.
[14:14.42]Look at that.
[14:15.36]No deaths.
[14:15.96]So right now... None at all.
[14:18.04]As of right now, we're going to be... That's the first four levels.
[14:21.19]That's like the, hey, this is bloody trap, Lin.
[14:22.97]This is how you play, right?
[14:25.01]Right.
[14:25.97]So now we're going to... This is the real deal.
[14:29.42]Give me one second.
[14:31.11]Hey, that guy tagged.
[14:31.83]Thanks for the $5.
[14:32.61]You didn't read out donations last stream.
[14:34.81]Uh, I did.
[14:35.27]This one looks pretty straightforward.
[14:37.42]I thought I did.
[14:38.46]Maybe I didn't.
[14:41.60]You spent over 400 GP to get tickets to Gorilla's gig.
[14:44.54]I think I saw that message yesterday.
[14:47.33]I thought I did.
[14:48.49]But thank you, tagged, for the $5.
[14:51.81]I saw the gorillas live.
[14:53.81]They were very very good.
[14:55.43]It was actually like one of the only concerts I've ever been to.
[14:58.67]And it was great.
[15:00.29]I saw them in Boston.
[15:01.33]I saw them at... Where did I see them?
[15:03.29]It was at a college.
[15:03.93]I don't remember.
[15:06.91]But thank you, ThatGuyTag2.
[15:08.61]Also thank you to Quigsy for the 20 bucks.
[15:10.08]You forgot to read subs last stream.
[15:11.50]Yeah, I need...
[15:12.98]Still not reading subs because I went off on a whole tangent about it.
[15:18.00]But I'm sorry about the no sub reading.
[15:20.62]There is a reason for it.
[15:21.56]I will address it.
[15:22.86]I've actually been talking to Blordow about certain art things to do to address it.
[15:27.64]But it's being thought about and being worked on.
[15:29.44]So thank you, Quigsy, for the $20.
[15:31.30]And Precip, thank you for the $2.
[15:33.38]They link to SoundCloud.
[15:35.53]But thank you.
[15:37.69]Okay.
[15:39.17]So are we starting it now?
[15:41.57]Yeah, we're starting it right now.
[15:44.10]So, no, you mean right now?
[15:46.34]Uh-huh.
[15:47.08]Okay, so no deaths as of right now.
[15:48.80]I meant you right now.
[15:49.78]Yeah.
[15:52.70]Alright, the joke's over.
[15:53.75]We're not doing the joke.
[15:54.61]Look, guys, we're going to die.
[15:56.53]It's going to happen.
[15:57.51]The joke is over.
[15:58.23]It's the whole point of the game.
[16:00.13]The whole point of the game is you're going to die a thousand times.
[16:02.67]So just don't even worry about it.
[16:07.86]Look, I'll get here.
[16:08.44]Wait, what about the secret button?
[16:13.06]I don't know what it unlocked.
[16:16.64]It just kills you.
[16:20.18]Okay.
[16:21.66]That's what the secret button does.
[16:22.94]It just makes your friends life harder.
[16:28.15]Not this time.
[16:29.01]I almost got him.
[16:32.09]How do you get across that stupid gap right there?
[16:35.25]You just walk off?
[16:36.11]You don't jump.
[16:36.71]You must not jump.
[16:37.41]You gotta be a god gamer.
[16:40.19]Aww, I didn't even make it past the first half.
[16:47.20]We gotta go back and beat that other one.
[16:49.10]I know!
[16:51.26]Palm Tree Island.
[16:53.56]It seems like it's co-op oriented, like it has... I'm not gonna think about it anymore.
[16:58.18]Not until we're there.
[16:59.45]Ooh, you just barely missed that one.
[17:00.79]Okay, what's the catch here?
[17:01.93]This level looks too easy.
[17:03.03]This level does look very easy.
[17:04.19]There's gotta be a catch.
[17:06.35]Oh, I see.
[17:07.09]There's double spike layers on the grass and the ceiling.
[17:10.21]Oh, wow.
[17:10.43]So you have to go over the razor, or you have to go between the spikes.
[17:15.52]I'm going to go with the between the spikes first try.
[17:17.32]PogChamps!
[17:19.36]I'm going to go for the over the razor.
[17:23.46]Okay, it's not even possible.
[17:25.78]Alright, we're going for first try.
[17:27.18]Champs!
[17:30.85]I love calling for PogChamps.
[17:32.43]It's one of my favorite things on Twitch.
[17:33.87]Okay.
[17:36.69]Alright, we're doing something wrong, Chalice.
[17:39.19]Yeah, just get to the side.
[17:41.41]Yeah, just, you know, we're doing something wrong.
[17:43.70]Just get to the easy side.
[17:47.88]Like this.
[17:48.78]The bridge, the bridge, the bridge.
[17:49.72]Look at the bridge.
[17:50.76]Yeah.
[17:51.38]Okay.
[17:52.20]Yeah, that's where you're supposed to land.
[17:54.14]Shit.
[17:55.92]And then what?
[17:57.16]And then you gotta go through that.
[17:59.45]Don't ask me how.
[18:00.13]I keep hitting that!
[18:03.17]Uhh, so get here.
[18:05.03]The worst part about Bloody Trapland is when you start dying so much that you just give up and go as fast as you can.
[18:09.95]I know, really.
[18:11.87]There we go.
[18:13.61]I'm just gonna wait right here.
[18:16.97]Okay, you- I'm gonna just protect myself, you try to do it.
[18:19.73]Uh-huh.
[18:26.06]I don't know, man.
[18:27.16]You gotta dive.
[18:27.60]I think you gotta do the trigger dive.
[18:30.98]I think it's on the way down.
[18:32.22]You gotta do it on the way down.
[18:34.70]You go first.
[18:35.12]I don't want to complicate these.
[18:40.68]That spike is much taller.
[18:42.08]Wait a second.
[18:42.80]What does this do?
[18:44.53]I don't know what I just did.
[18:45.73]What does that do?
[18:46.79]There's a secret path underneath the level.
[18:49.73]Holy shit.
[18:51.51]We win.
[18:56.80]It was that easy.
[18:57.60]It was right there in front of our eyes the whole time.
[18:59.58]Yeah, it was that easy.
[19:03.20]Wow.
[19:03.86]Is that kind of like a Mario and Luigi, you're not good enough, it's too hard for you, please beat the level?
[19:10.40]It could be.
[19:10.98]Like, Helper will take control for you for the rest of the level.
[19:17.09]Or if you just lose to... Oh, that's the, like... Oh, that's how they want you to slide on it.
[19:23.29]I like the trigger better.
[19:25.63]Really?
[19:25.87]Did I just
[19:27.96]I actually just died to that.
[19:28.84]Oh, you did too.
[19:29.28]I don't feel bad.
[19:30.32]I don't feel so bad.
[19:32.66]I like that slide.
[19:33.40]Reminds me of Major Man.
[19:36.38]Another little secret area, I think, in here.
[19:44.17]Is there a button that you see anywhere?
[19:50.25]Oh, no.
[19:51.37]No, come on.
[19:54.06]Oh, that was close.
[19:55.12]Oh, man, I like this one.
[19:56.14]Reminds me of Major Man.
[19:58.32]Easy, don't get too close.
[20:00.74]So you gotta go right now.
[20:04.98]What kind of pendulum swing is this?
[20:06.69]It goes left, right, and it has three tiers of up.
[20:12.47]I can see you got it.
[20:13.37]Just win it for us.
[20:15.11]Is there a secret button?
[20:15.97]There's gotta be secrets.
[20:17.13]Look, there's a rock up here.
[20:19.81]Wow, easy.
[20:21.35]That was very close.
[20:23.01]I remember those from the first game.
[20:25.15]Nice, you did it.
[20:25.65]But what about the left there?
[20:26.50]I won one.
[20:26.80]It's my turn.
[20:27.46]But what about the, um, how do we open the stone thing?
[20:29.76]I don't know.
[20:30.52]We could go back and look if you want.
[20:33.44]I don't see any buttons.
[20:35.76]Hey, guys, just out of curiosity, we want to make sure we're keeping score here.
[20:40.48]According to the in-game counter, you and I have died zero times.
[20:44.24]That's true.
[20:44.82]So, I think we're doing okay.
[20:47.18]Zero deaths so far, guys.
[20:48.54]It's on paper.
[20:49.80]You guys can say whatever you want.
[20:51.20]Deaths, zero.
[20:57.23]I like the upgrade.
[20:58.73]It's nice having some in-game stats tracked in Bloody Trapline 2.
[21:03.47]That wasn't there in the first game, you know?
[21:04.69]Tracking zero deaths.
[21:10.10]Thanks.
[21:12.00]Where did you go?
[21:12.66]I don't... I... Okay, I guess you died.
[21:15.34]Alright, we can go up or down.
[21:19.08]I'm gonna go... I'll go up.
[21:20.56]No, don't... Okay, I did not see that other spike.
[21:22.72]You have to land, like, right there on the ledge.
[21:24.50]I'm running like a limp.
[21:29.77]There's like a very, very small window for what constitutes a belly flop and what constitutes getting more air.
[21:37.17]Where did that fish hit me?
[21:37.93]Did you see that fish?
[21:39.53]I don't know.
[21:40.09]I think it's just traps.
[21:43.49]I just barely got it.
[21:44.17]Okay, there's a button there though.
[21:47.47]So wish me luck.
[21:48.67]Look, there's a little spike there.
[21:49.67]I'm going to just drop down.
[21:52.33]What?
[21:54.17]I hit the spikes that were up there.
[21:57.86]This one's gonna give me anxiety for sure.
[21:59.38]And that's a stupid fish.
[22:00.66]Where's this fish?
[22:01.38]That fish can... How do you do that?
[22:04.24]You just gotta have a little bit... You just gotta jump.
[22:05.52]I don't understand how to get the distance.
[22:07.14]It's all about the jump of the glide.
[22:09.70]You do it immediately?
[22:11.15]So when you jump, it's like jump, bang.
[22:13.29]Like jump, glide.
[22:13.91]And I just like was showing you that, and now I'm down here.
[22:16.15]Yeah.
[22:16.67]Oh, fuck.
[22:20.35]Zero deaths.
[22:21.71]I just belly flop.
[22:22.59]What's up with the belly flop?
[22:24.83]Oh shit, now I can't even do it now.
[22:27.27]Now I'm like losing it.
[22:27.99]We've lost the magic sauce.
[22:30.21]I think you have to wait like just a beat.
[22:32.43]It's right at the peak of the jump.
[22:35.01]Oh god, I'm like overthinking it now.
[22:38.09]It's so easy to do.
[22:39.09]It's so easy to like do it.
[22:40.27]Now I'm just like, now I can't do it.
[22:41.85]I can't do it.
[22:44.19]I can't do it anymore.
[22:47.08]I've just overthought it so much.
[22:49.34]It's like breathing or blinking now.
[22:52.00]Yeah, when you start thinking about blinking, you just can't stop, and it freaks you out.
[22:55.70]Everybody in the chat right now, like, Italian, everybody.
[22:57.74]He's so mad.
[22:59.06]No, like, blinking?
[23:00.02]Like, think about, like, your body blinks.
[23:02.56]I know.
[23:02.92]Once every, like, five seconds, three seconds.
[23:04.16]And now you're doing it manually.
[23:06.32]Now you're blinking manually.
[23:07.44]And every time you blink from now on, you're gonna be like, fuck, I can feel it.
[23:10.22]And now it's gonna freak you out.
[23:13.04]Alright, you ready?
[23:14.44]There's a spike there just waiting.
[23:16.56]Yeah.
[23:17.12]So don't jump this one.
[23:18.87]Just fall.
[23:19.73]Because I jumped and it killed me.
[23:21.47]Okay.
[23:22.09]Okay, well, you gotta do it better than I did.
[23:29.97]Come on!
[23:30.97]Get up there!
[23:31.59]Stop freaking out!
[23:38.77]Okay, I got it down here.
[23:39.77]Oh, nice.
[23:40.59]Is this a Mega Man slide?
[23:41.87]This might be a Mega Man slide.
[23:43.57]Yep.
[23:43.74]No, I just don't want to get hit by the saw.
[23:48.00]And we can get out of here.
[23:51.08]Or I could just hit the... Should I hit the laugh out loud button?
[23:53.80]What do you think?
[23:56.36]Oh, God.
[23:56.84]You freaked me out.
[23:57.42]You messed me up.
[23:59.94]I just heard a cannon boom.
[24:03.04]Alright, Alex.
[24:03.71]Are you ready for the laugh out loud button?
[24:07.11]It's going to be funny.
[24:12.34]Oh, gotta laugh out loud.
[24:17.30]Oh, I am much worse at this game.
[24:20.62]Hey, it's alright.
[24:21.08]Now we're getting to, like, the actual game.
[24:29.89]Zero deaths.
[24:30.69]Yeah, we're at zero deaths still.
[24:33.31]We haven't died yet.
[24:35.33]I'm currently laughing out loud.
[24:37.80]Yeah, I am.
[24:39.02]Can you tell?
[24:40.62]Nice.
[24:41.90]Nice.
[24:42.94]What's this one up at the top left for?
[24:45.34]I don't know.
[24:47.06]Is it just a trick?
[24:51.35]Like, use me.
[24:57.55]Alright, use me.
[24:59.13]Yeah, there you go.
[25:00.45]You got to use me.
[25:02.63]I need to go to the left.
[25:03.17]Excuse me.
[25:03.45]Alright, what is it?
[25:06.55]What'd you find?
[25:06.95]I don't know.
[25:08.33]I still hear the pitter-patter of my feet.
[25:10.79]Oh.
[25:11.57]A whole lot of nothing.
[25:12.83]Okay.
[25:16.45]Why?
[25:17.31]Shit.
[25:17.69]I didn't even see that.
[25:18.73]Why is it there?
[25:19.35]I don't know.
[25:20.59]Whatever.
[25:21.15]Hey, hey.
[25:21.53]Early access.
[25:22.51]It's an early access game.
[25:26.85]Ugh.
[25:28.19]I was, like, waiting for you.
[25:30.44]Oh.
[25:33.70]We got moving platforms now.
[25:35.01]We're getting some challenge upgrades.
[25:40.05]Boom.
[25:40.33]Thank God.
[25:41.11]I was going to have a lot of trouble.
[25:43.65]My turn to be a winner.
[25:47.83]Now we're at level 10.
[25:48.81]I think right here we're at the point of, hey, welcome to bloody trap land and you did it.
[25:53.07]Congratulations.
[25:53.83]Now get ready to play the real game.
[25:59.77]This looks like the real game.
[26:02.88]Yep.
[26:03.68]I knew that was going to happen.
[26:04.98]What did that do?
[26:09.01]Etalyx, I think we're about to fight a boss.
[26:11.31]Um, okay.
[26:14.43]I vaguely remember seeing this in the trailer.
[26:17.75]This is just the Egyptian level boss from Mario 64.
[26:21.18]I know how to beat him.
[26:22.24]You've got to wait until he puts his hand down and then you've got to jump on the hand and hit him right in the eye.
[26:26.82]Yep, here it comes.
[26:27.70]Ready?
[26:29.66]I'm gonna go hit the button.
[26:30.36]There's a button over there.
[26:31.16]Whoa, he can do diagonal attacks too.
[26:35.60]Oh, one of us has to move this.
[26:38.22]Ow.
[26:40.40]So the cannon has to be moved.
[26:42.56]I move the cannon.
[26:43.30]Alright, so you move the cannon and I'll just shoot him.
[26:45.42]Or I'll just die by the easy piece of shit spikes at the very beginning of the level.
[26:50.15]I got the cannon.
[26:51.89]God, he's gonna swing at me.
[26:52.73]He's gonna swing at me.
[26:53.48]Yeah, he's gonna.
[26:54.44]I just, I don't know if he's gonna do it.
[26:56.56]Okay.
[26:56.72]I gotta get him in his brain.
[26:58.18]You got him in the brain.
[27:00.26]Moving it back.
[27:00.80]Okay, here we go.
[27:03.86]I got it.
[27:05.06]Your job is so easy.
[27:06.94]My job is like excruciatingly different.
[27:09.08]Put it back, put it back.
[27:10.10]I'm moving it.
[27:10.58]I'm moving it right now.
[27:11.68]It's going.
[27:12.62]Got it.
[27:13.24]You got it.
[27:14.08]One more hit.
[27:15.54]Nope.
[27:16.32]There's gotta be one more, I think.
[27:17.16]Yeah, one more.
[27:18.46]Alright, moving the cannon now.
[27:22.72]You missed!
[27:26.10]We almost had zero deaths!
[27:27.70]We almost- oh, come on!
[27:29.95]I'm just gonna- I'm just gonna sit here in the corner if that's cool.
[27:32.93]What the F-U-C-K?
[27:34.65]I'm just gonna chill right there.
[27:36.91]He's got him.
[27:38.51]Three hits.
[27:40.65]Did you shoot him again?
[27:41.59]How are you supposed to do this if you're playing solo?
[27:43.87]I have no idea you have to hit it and then but yeah, we just made it so much easier Kind of like feel bad he that looks like fucked up.
[27:52.59]I like the one eyeball like looking off to the side Yeah, this this guy is dead He's really dead this this is not just like a joke this person is person's dead and on the screen is a dead person Two dead people I knew you were gonna make that
[28:12.44]That was actually kind of easy.
[28:13.92]We just killed Grover.
[28:16.73]We just killed one of the Muppets.
[28:19.03]Alright, let's do it.
[28:19.87]Keep going.
[28:21.33]Wait, should we get on the... What is this?
[28:30.41]Are you driving the boat?
[28:31.46]Yeah.
[28:32.74]I just drove the boat to this little island.
[28:34.82]Actually, this is very cool.
[28:36.70]I think it is really cool.
[28:37.78]I'm very happy.
[28:38.62]It's an interesting addition.
[28:40.60]It's a Wind Waker addition.
[28:42.95]What does it mean?
[28:44.05]Oh.
[28:47.17]Easy level.
[28:48.51]That was very easy.
[28:51.97]Is that it?
[28:52.79]Yeah, that was actually, that was a pretty easy level.
[28:54.39]Alright, you want to try to figure this one out before we go any further?
[28:57.07]That must be one of the, like, early access levels.
[29:02.94]Alright, let's try this one again.
[29:04.16]Let's do tier one.
[29:05.60]We've gotten a little bit, we just need to be smart about this.
[29:14.68]There's nowhere to go.
[29:15.61]It's definitely, here it is, ready?
[29:16.91]Watch this.
[29:18.75]You have to go?
[29:20.17]I have to run under it and jump the fish.
[29:22.70]Go for it.
[29:25.40]I have to double jump.
[29:26.54]That's the problem.
[29:27.28]Ready?
[29:30.40]Move out of the way.
[29:33.86]Oh, I got it.
[29:34.38]I got it.
[29:34.64]I got it.
[29:35.71]How do you do that?
[29:37.21]Shit!
[29:37.99]Why didn't you go?
[29:38.67]I just respawned.
[29:40.89]Why didn't you go?
[29:41.69]Did you hear how I said that?
[29:42.75]Why didn't you go?
[29:43.53]What an actor.
[29:44.99]Did you hear that shitty acting?
[29:46.89]Like, hey, why didn't you go?
[29:51.16]Hey, why don't you go, man?
[29:52.14]Whoa!
[29:55.08]I can't even do it again.
[29:59.48]You got it.
[29:59.76]That's what we needed.
[30:00.40]That's what we needed.
[30:04.72]How are you still up there?
[30:06.16]There's a spike, too?
[30:07.26]I don't know.
[30:07.78]I'm just going to keep doing this.
[30:09.58]Oh, God.
[30:12.02]It was a good effort.
[30:13.19]It was a good effort.
[30:14.19]I don't know how you... I didn't realize this was an acting stream.
[30:19.56]Hey, why didn't you go?
[30:22.96]That was like a YouTube video, like, reaction.
[30:26.84]Whoa!
[30:28.01]Whoa!
[30:28.81]Alright, fuck, hold on.
[30:31.91]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[30:32.93]I gotta just get that going again.
[30:34.31]Okay, bring it back.
[30:39.41]You're free to go.
[30:40.89]You are free to go now.
[30:43.11]Just watch out for the fish.
[30:44.34]Calm down, calm down, calm down.
[30:45.20]Stay right there.
[30:46.70]I did the under jump.
[30:47.44]I can move over here now.
[30:48.92]Yeah.
[30:49.18]Because it's looking at me.
[30:50.72]Hold on.
[30:51.62]So you've got time.
[30:52.70]But where do I need to go when you press that button?
[30:57.23]I don't know.
[30:57.49]Do you want to just hang out there?
[30:58.95]I'm going to... Okay, look.
[31:00.31]You need to come to me.
[31:01.47]God damn it.
[31:02.29]You have to come to me in case I die on the stupid fish.
[31:04.55]That's true.
[31:06.54]Because otherwise we're going to have to do it all over again.
[31:08.38]You go press the button.
[31:11.39]Etalyx.
[31:12.11]Etalyx.
[31:13.56]Etalyx.
[31:14.02]You were supposed to just press the button.
[31:15.42]That's all you needed to do.
[31:16.90]And you're dead.
[31:17.42]I'm so sorry.
[31:18.34]That's it.
[31:18.90]Let me show you how easy that was.
[31:20.42]Hang on.
[31:21.86]I almost just squirted up.
[31:23.29]Alright, it drops that.
[31:25.57]Yep.
[31:27.29]Okay.
[31:27.53]So you just come over here.
[31:34.25]Alright.
[31:34.47]I don't know what's going on, but I'm here.
[31:36.13]Can you... Oh, you dummy.
[31:39.43]You dummy.
[31:40.59]You dummy.
[31:40.93]I didn't mean to.
[31:42.19]I didn't mean to.
[31:43.29]Oh, what a dummy.
[31:46.27]You dummy.
[31:51.08]We might have to do it all over again.
[31:52.38]No, no, no, no.
[31:53.32]You sure?
[31:54.24]Yeah, because I've got the laser.
[31:56.20]You just have to not get killed by the spike or the fish.
[32:01.36]That's all you have to do.
[32:02.80]I know.
[32:04.54]I'm being a real dummy.
[32:05.56]I'm being a dummy right now.
[32:08.88]One more.
[32:09.46]No!
[32:09.82]Wait, wait, wait.
[32:11.44]It's not as easy as it looks.
[32:14.64]Okay, it's not as easy as it looks.
[32:16.58]Oh my god.
[32:17.83]I swear to god.
[32:19.67]I swear to god.
[32:20.71]Like, I need to stop this.
[32:22.33]Just calm down.
[32:23.05]Don't just rush it.
[32:23.87]Go.
[32:25.33]And I rushed it again.
[32:26.85]I rushed it again.
[32:27.55]I don't know.
[32:28.37]I don't know, Alex.
[32:29.73]I don't know why I did that.
[32:30.96]you jumped so early seriously like stop this slow down easy okay there you did it now you just gotta alley up yourself and I'm crashing so that nobody gets killed here you can jump to your heart's content so what
[32:48.81]I don't know.
[32:49.17]We have to pull the laser to the left and someone has to wall jump on the interior.
[32:52.97]Walk with me.
[32:53.57]Walk with me.
[32:54.13]Come with me.
[32:55.02]The laser's going to get both of us.
[32:56.14]No, it won't.
[32:56.84]No, you have to go jump in the... See the little tower in the middle?
[33:01.20]Oh, I see.
[33:01.54]Yep.
[33:01.76]Okay.
[33:02.68]You've got to wall jump between both of those.
[33:04.90]Now, I'm going to have to run and lure the laser back to you.
[33:10.10]Okay.
[33:11.26]I think.
[33:11.92]I don't know.
[33:12.36]Does that sound reasonable?
[33:13.94]I don't know, because aren't you making a force field for me to not be able to... Okay, you just... I think so, but I don't know.
[33:19.20]Just run to the left.
[33:21.23]I think I have to go back under.
[33:22.53]I think so.
[33:25.07]I think I have to go, like, if I can make it.
[33:27.43]I don't think I can make it, though.
[33:29.39]It's definitely going to kill me, no matter what.
[33:31.17]So, here we go.
[33:31.65]If you run to the left, it's going to pull to the left, but then I'm not going to be able to jump down, because it's going to be... You're not going to... You have to go in between.
[33:38.40]How am I gonna do that?
[33:39.00]You have to like slide down.
[33:40.08]Oh, I know what's gonna happen.
[33:41.22]Just hold left.
[33:41.90]Okay, so I... You... Don't jump.
[33:44.94]You run back here.
[33:46.57]Yeah.
[33:47.01]Because I'm gonna go underneath it.
[33:48.27]You're gonna bring it up and it's gonna go high enough where I can go underneath it, right?
[33:51.65]Theoretically?
[33:53.09]Uh, yeah.
[33:53.53]So I'm gonna run to the left.
[33:54.97]You're gonna slide down the tube.
[33:57.40]Yep.
[33:57.68]When the laser would normally be hitting you.
[33:59.92]That's right.
[34:00.34]Then you're gonna have to run to the right, slide under the lip that I'm currently crouched under, and then wall jump up to victory.
[34:06.34]And I'm gonna get ten rupees.
[34:09.33]Yeah, that's it's at least 15 for the blue Alright, you ready hold on like I need to be back here Wait, why are you so far back now?
[34:19.03]What did I do?
[34:20.29]Because I have to run past you for the laser to look at you You should have she should have stayed at the like temple.
[34:27.24]Oh
[34:28.92]Hold on.
[34:29.62]I can fix this.
[34:32.43]Just stay there.
[34:34.79]Don't move.
[34:35.43]Don't move.
[34:36.43]I just gotta do this.
[34:37.15]I just gotta come back over here.
[34:39.21]You just gotta do this one quick thing.
[34:40.81]There you go.
[34:42.13]Okay.
[34:42.53]Okay, nice.
[34:45.63]I'm ready.
[34:46.93]So stay on the right side.
[34:49.05]Because that's closer.
[34:50.03]It'll be easier for me to run past you.
[34:52.14]Then when the laser gets close to you, you just hold left.
[34:55.10]You don't jump.
[34:56.14]Just hold left.
[34:57.72]You can wall jump if you need to after sliding down.
[35:00.02]Got it.
[35:00.74]Alright, ready?
[35:02.50]3, 2, 1, go.
[35:03.22]Just rip the band-aid off.
[35:03.92]Hurry.
[35:06.02]You stupid game!
[35:07.64]What happened?
[35:08.28]This game is stupid!
[35:10.39]What?
[35:11.87]How did you explode?
[35:15.69]Did the game lag for you?
[35:16.82]Because you were just in the middle of the two.
[35:20.30]It trapped me and crushed me!
[35:23.08]I didn't see that.
[35:24.70]I didn't see that at all.
[35:25.66]It just looked like you spontaneously exploded.
[35:27.96]Did you hear that?
[35:28.52]That reaction was so awful.
[35:34.85]That was such a PG way to be mad about that.
[35:37.77]Well, now we have to do this whole thing again.
[35:39.17]Uh-huh.
[35:40.73]Oh my god.
[35:42.89]So, how did it crush you?
[35:44.76]A platform came up and locked me in.
[35:48.55]And then it crushed me.
[35:49.37]Spikes came from the walls and crushed me.
[35:56.21]I think I have to jump.
[35:57.72]I don't know.
[35:58.12]Alright, you can go.
[36:04.02]Pro moves.
[36:05.16]Alright, let's get back there.
[36:06.06]Try that again.
[36:11.46]That just, like, fucked me up.
[36:12.76]Alright, hold on.
[36:13.24]I can't believe you still survived.
[36:14.68]I know.
[36:15.46]How did I make that?
[36:16.83]What?
[36:19.81]What?
[36:22.73]I was innocent.
[36:23.67]I didn't do anything.
[36:26.09]What do you have fun with your friends?
[36:31.61]You don't have a game where you play with your friends.
[36:33.85]Yeah, I know that game.
[36:35.15]I think somebody does something funny.
[36:37.45]We're just laughing about it.
[36:41.27]This is actually, like, this is so easy and we just can't do it.
[36:43.85]We're just two children.
[36:45.11]Well, to be fair, the final part is not that easy.
[36:48.47]Alright, so watch what happens here.
[36:49.75]Ready?
[36:50.85]If I stay still... I don't see any platform.
[36:53.06]You're just floating in the air.
[36:54.62]No, you're just floating in the air.
[36:56.20]Now you just died.
[36:57.12]Oh, now I see it.
[36:58.38]There's some, like, host issues.
[36:59.74]What the hell are you supposed to do there?
[37:02.06]Oh, I'm actually getting angry at this stupid spike on the wall here.
[37:06.94]Um...
[37:08.84]Like, what the hell are you supposed to do on that?
[37:10.24]Here, you go where I am so I can see what you're experiencing.
[37:12.64]Alright, so you, go ahead.
[37:20.24]So, drop down that hole.
[37:21.92]It blocks you, and then spikes come and kill you.
[37:25.18]Oh, yep, there are the spikes.
[37:26.30]Alright, yeah, it makes sense now.
[37:28.14]I get it.
[37:28.60]So you can't drop down this, so I think I have to, like,
[37:31.99]I don't know, dude.
[37:32.57]Do I have to go around?
[37:35.53]I must have to go around and glide down.
[37:40.16]Guys, this is teamwork.
[37:41.48]We're trying to figure it all out.
[37:42.58]We're trying to figure out what happened.
[37:43.62]I do kind of enjoy the puzzly aspect of it, actually.
[37:47.12]Alright, so if you go up, you get locked in.
[37:51.39]You're not allowed to go back down that way.
[37:53.81]Go for it!
[37:54.75]Just go!
[37:59.20]Okay, here's the question.
[38:01.12]Here's the question.
[38:01.89]Yeah.
[38:02.89]If you get... Just let me get back to the top.
[38:05.35]I gotta try something.
[38:06.25]Okay.
[38:07.41]Uh, you need to let me get the aggro here.
[38:09.93]Why am I calling it aggro?
[38:10.65]That's one way to do it.
[38:12.01]Gotta get aggro.
[38:13.25]Uh, pulling.
[38:14.99]Can you even do this with fucking one person?
[38:19.05]I think you have to go all the way to the left.
[38:24.56]I'm pretty sure somebody has to go all the way to the left.
[38:27.18]Because I think about it, right?
[38:30.46]I think you're right, but... So if I go here... And if I die, can the laser still hit you?
[38:37.56]I think I can fall... We're gonna give this a try.
[38:40.72]So you're gonna... I don't think the... Do what you did before.
[38:43.76]Pull the laser over here.
[38:44.80]I'm gonna just jump and slide.
[38:47.01]And we're gonna go for a slide.
[38:49.79]Hang on.
[38:50.39]Before we do that, I've got an idea.
[38:51.97]Let me just test something really quickly.
[38:53.47]Hold on.
[38:54.94]Bang.
[38:55.42]That's it.
[38:55.74]Yeah.
[38:56.10]Okay.
[38:56.74]But I'm wondering if you can do that by just dropping down.
[38:59.88]Look, start on the left.
[39:01.90]And instead of jumping off, if you just run off and hold left...
[39:05.69]Okay, that's not what I meant.
[39:06.99]Use your, like, hold left, and then use your, not right now, but when you're at the top of the temple.
[39:12.77]Yeah.
[39:13.19]Then use your double jump, like, curve around the spikes, and then double jump back onto the- Curve around the spikes?
[39:17.73]What is this, Wanted?
[39:19.97]Yeah, we gotta curve bullets!
[39:20.86]You're not gonna curve me.
[39:21.96]I'm not curving the cat.
[39:23.08]It's not gonna happen.
[39:24.38]You totally can, though.
[39:25.30]Alright, we're gonna try it this way.
[39:26.20]Here's what you're gonna do.
[39:26.80]Alright, what do you want me to do?
[39:27.48]You're going up.
[39:27.80]You're gonna run up, and you're gonna go left.
[39:28.92]You're gonna run up, and you're gonna get to the top of the tower.
[39:30.46]Okay.
[39:31.32]And I'm gonna sneak underneath.
[39:33.08]Okay.
[39:33.48]See, you know what I'm talking about?
[39:34.44]You run left and you go on the right.
[39:35.82]I'll try, but I'm not gonna get this.
[39:37.38]Alright, go for it.
[39:38.04]Ready?
[39:38.58]Three.
[39:39.95]Didn't even do a countdown.
[39:41.11]That's fine.
[39:43.39]Come on!
[39:43.87]Slide.
[39:46.13]I didn't do it!
[39:46.63]Oh, no!
[39:48.09]He choked.
[39:48.83]He choked, ladies and gentlemen.
[39:52.34]That was it.
[39:52.90]That was it.
[39:53.70]That was the one.
[39:54.46]Now it's your turn.
[39:55.24]Stay where you are.
[39:59.54]Oh, damn it.
[40:00.32]I'm so angry.
[40:02.13]I just- I didn't think I had another opportunity to- to- to- I- fucking- hold on!
[40:07.14]UGH!
[40:09.67]Just- hold on a second.
[40:11.11]I- I really- I'm gonna just take a fucking drink.
[40:13.77]Yep.
[40:14.75]Just take a big drink.
[40:17.17]At this point, I'm honestly not sure if you're doing it on purpose or not.
[40:19.97]I'm not.
[40:20.53]I promise.
[40:20.97]Okay.
[40:21.79]I can't tell.
[40:22.71]No, I'm not.
[40:23.09]I swear to God.
[40:25.96]When I get like this, man, I get locked the fuck in.
[40:30.52]Look at this.
[40:30.90]Look what's happening to me.
[40:31.88]This is stage one.
[40:32.94]You do it.
[40:33.94]Just like, can you do it?
[40:34.64]Just show me how to do it.
[40:35.38]It's like riding a bike.
[40:36.12]You need to teach me how to ride a fucking bike again.
[40:37.72]Okay.
[40:38.88]Okay, we're good.
[40:45.60]What was that?
[40:46.90]I don't know.
[40:47.38]I gotta calm down.
[40:47.78]Oh, now it's my turn.
[40:48.54]Now it's my turn.
[40:49.70]You're throwing us all off here, okay?
[40:51.50]I seriously like... You're just messing up everything here.
[40:57.64]I know.
[40:58.40]I just gotta go.
[40:59.06]I gotta just calm down.
[41:01.40]You go.
[41:02.14]Slowly.
[41:02.52]Uh-huh.
[41:04.02]I'm there.
[41:05.07]Slowly.
[41:06.33]Okay.
[41:06.91]I'm gonna try this again.
[41:09.93]Alright.
[41:11.19]Here we go.
[41:11.97]Are you ready?
[41:12.79]Three, two, one.
[41:14.51]Running.
[41:17.04]Oh, gosh.
[41:19.82]I think I can do it.
[41:20.58]I think I can do it.
[41:22.15]I think I can do it.
[41:23.25]Hey, I'm allowed to have, like, a couple of mess-ups.
[41:25.89]Yeah, no, it's okay.
[41:26.51]That's alright.
[41:27.41]So you gotta, like, let that thing... You jump over here to the left so that thing goes really high.
[41:31.77]You know what I'm saying?
[41:34.91]Like, when you get to the middle, you gotta, like, jump to get that thing to, like, get high, high, high, high, high.
[41:39.03]I know, I know.
[41:39.79]Here we go again.
[41:41.49]Three, two, one, go.
[41:42.11]Okay, very good.
[41:45.27]Very good.
[41:49.42]Forgot the last slide?
[41:50.50]I blew it.
[41:51.32]It's okay.
[41:54.88]We will get it.
[41:56.24]We will get it.
[41:57.18]I'm determined.
[41:58.62]I think I've got it.
[41:59.26]I want to try something.
[42:01.08]Oh, I forgot.
[42:06.01]You want me to be the... God damn it.
[42:11.75]Oh, God.
[42:12.29]Come on.
[42:13.39]No, shit.
[42:17.39]No.
[42:18.19]Don't go on.
[42:19.09]Don't turn into me, please.
[42:20.39]No.
[42:21.59]I'm laughing so hard because I'm watching you, like, panicking.
[42:25.19]Like, you're trying to wall jump as best as you can.
[42:30.52]That's what makes it so funny.
[42:33.80]Oh, no.
[42:37.52]I can't.
[42:38.32]I can't do it.
[42:39.32]I'm freaking out.
[42:40.80]It's all falling apart.
[42:41.80]It really is.
[42:42.20]There.
[42:42.74]There.
[42:43.18]I got it.
[42:43.54]Alright.
[42:45.88]You go first.
[42:47.47]Yep.
[42:54.30]Alright, we're gonna do one try again.
[42:56.00]I feel... I blow this shit, dude.
[42:57.78]Like, you've seen me blow this like a thousand times.
[42:59.74]It's okay.
[43:00.00]I do too.
[43:00.74]I do too.
[43:01.16]Alright, you ready?
[43:02.42]Ready?
[43:02.70]3, 2, 1, go.
[43:04.68]Oh, gosh.
[43:09.92]Buy you as much time as I can.
[43:13.00]It didn't even work!
[43:14.28]You do it!
[43:14.98]You do it!
[43:16.16]It didn't even work!
[43:17.10]I couldn't even wall jump.
[43:18.16]It didn't even do anything.
[43:19.90]It didn't do anything.
[43:20.64]It was like, seriously, the game fucked up all of me.
[43:22.88]My controllers, they're having button problems.
[43:26.42]It was the controller's fault.
[43:27.76]And by the way, start on the left.
[43:31.16]Calm down.
[43:32.02]What?
[43:32.18]What?
[43:32.34]So see where you are right now.
[43:38.93]Instead of doing right, left, right, do left, right, left.
[43:43.47]Start on the left wall.
[43:46.07]I'm starting on the right wall, and it's fucking me up.
[43:49.05]And you know what?
[43:49.75]I'm a little bit on that mad side.
[43:54.35]I dumped maple syrup on this controller or something.
[43:58.70]And I press X and it sticks in and I can't press X again.
[44:03.14]When did I eat pancakes?
[44:07.30]I must have eaten, like, a waffle sundae and, like, used this controller.
[44:18.17]What did I eat?
[44:18.95]Like, a pint of ice cream.
[44:19.81]I'm starting to lose it.
[44:21.29]Oh, are you going again?
[44:22.71]Or am I?
[44:23.57]I'm doing it again.
[44:24.45]Oh, you're doing it.
[44:24.99]I'm going to redeem myself here.
[44:27.55]Okay.
[44:29.03]Three, two, one, go.
[44:36.32]Here we go.
[44:38.95]Oh, you shithead!
[44:40.73]Not you.
[44:41.15]Alright, it's my turn!
[44:45.99]You try.
[44:49.11]I will try, but I don't think it's going to go very well.
[44:53.20]Okay, go!
[44:54.84]Go, go, go!
[44:57.06]You threw me so far off doing that.
[45:00.06]I didn't even have my hands on the controller.
[45:03.47]I freaked the laser out so fast.
[45:06.33]I didn't even have my hands on the controller.
[45:08.41]Wait, what?
[45:10.76]I was not prepared.
[45:15.60]It was ready, too.
[45:17.49]Oh, wow.
[45:18.21]Life sucks.
[45:19.61]It was ready, too.
[45:21.47]Oh, wow.
[45:22.19]Life sucks.
[45:25.89]We're going to get this eventually here.
[45:27.59]I'm glad that there's levels like this, though, that require patience.
[45:32.46]And teamwork and cooperation.
[45:34.16]You go over there.
[45:34.82]We'll do that again.
[45:35.58]Okay.
[45:39.23]Okay.
[45:40.01]You tell me when you're ready.
[45:41.07]I'm gonna... You ready?
[45:43.69]Here we go.
[45:45.27]So start from here.
[45:45.95]Do you just walk off the ledge?
[45:47.48]Walk and then jump.
[45:48.20]That's what I did.
[45:48.84]Okay.
[45:49.50]Okay.
[45:49.92]I'm going.
[45:55.62]Oh, Etalyx, what have you done?
[45:56.74]Etalyx, I had that on lockdown.
[45:58.88]I had that on lockdown.
[46:00.20]What have you done?
[46:00.72]I had that shit on lockdown.
[46:05.01]It was following me.
[46:06.07]You had an extra two seconds.
[46:07.85]You had two extra seconds.
[46:10.79]Get over there.
[46:11.51]Get over there.
[46:12.95]Get over there quick.
[46:19.50]I can't see.
[46:21.66]Stop going blind.
[46:22.96]There's no time for that.
[46:23.80]You don't have time for any medical conditions.
[46:29.70]Okay, you do it.
[46:31.46]You do it, please.
[46:32.64]There's no time for, like, a medical emergency.
[46:35.48]Alright, get over there.
[46:37.50]No, me, I don't... I don't wanna... Okay, I'll go.
[46:40.30]You have to do it.
[46:40.76]I don't wanna, though.
[46:41.22]You have to.
[46:42.72]You have to do it.
[46:43.24]I'm gonna mess it up again.
[46:44.54]Alright, you ready?
[46:45.12]I'm gonna... Okay.
[46:45.82]I'm not giving you any time.
[46:46.73]No time for any medical emergencies.
[46:48.15]Okay.
[46:48.39]If you're having problems, I feel bad for you, son.
[46:51.37]I got 99 problems.
[46:52.97]I just hit one!
[46:56.85]Oh!
[47:01.59]That was a good effort though.
[47:03.11]That was better than the last... I can't go again.
[47:06.63]I can't go again.
[47:10.85]How do you even... How do you even... I think we might need to rethink our strategy here.
[47:19.83]I can't feel my extremities now.
[47:23.43]My fingers are numb.
[47:25.51]Slow it down.
[47:25.97]Slow it down.
[47:27.13]We gotta rethink this.
[47:28.47]Okay.
[47:28.96]I think this is almost working.
[47:32.68]It's so close.
[47:33.42]Alright, what do you think?
[47:39.08]What happens if you... Can you get all the way to the top of the middle thing?
[47:44.71]I don't think so.
[47:46.79]I think you have to... I think you have to let this... We both have to be back here.
[47:54.50]Here's an idea.
[47:55.18]We both have to be back here, dude.
[47:58.30]Why?
[47:58.82]Because I think it has to be high enough where I can run underneath it.
[48:03.22]Yeah, but it's higher for the person that's, like, at the top of the... Oh, well, that person's not close.
[48:10.42]That person's not close enough to attract the laser's attention, though.
[48:12.79]But if you run back here and come all the way back here, then maybe we can both just run for it.
[48:16.91]Huh.
[48:18.09]I can give it a try, but I don't know if I can... I'll go.
[48:21.13]Please stay there.
[48:22.03]No, never mind.
[48:22.73]What if I just... What if I stand, like, here?
[48:24.31]You know what I mean?
[48:29.41]Am I going to get hit by that laser if I jump at the right time?
[48:35.46]No, you're still going to get hit.
[48:38.80]You stand there, I'm going to jump above you.
[48:42.26]Ready?
[48:42.98]3, 2, 1, go.
[48:45.96]Oh, shit in my pants.
[48:48.26]How did you not just get hit by that?
[48:51.95]Because I just kept running.
[49:05.73]Wait a minute.
[49:06.65]Wait a minute.
[49:07.27]Wait a minute.
[49:07.75]Do you see that?
[49:08.69]Oh, you totally can.
[49:09.87]You totally can.
[49:10.53]This changes everything.
[49:11.31]Oh, that changes everything.
[49:12.07]Yeah, okay, we win.
[49:13.50]Okay, let's slow.
[49:14.54]Slow it down.
[49:15.52]Slow it down.
[49:19.02]We got this.
[49:19.72]We win.
[49:21.56]Yeah, we win.
[49:23.50]Just don't be an idiot.
[49:24.20]Just win.
[49:27.72]Talics don't.
[49:28.48]Talics just win.
[49:29.62]We're good.
[49:30.50]I'm there.
[49:31.16]Talics don't play idiot.
[49:32.10]Just win.
[49:32.48]I made it.
[49:33.73]Okay.
[49:34.19]So now.
[49:36.35]Whoever is tracking the laser has to jump up there and get up to the top.
[49:41.85]You go first.
[49:42.35]You want that to be me?
[49:43.27]You want me to go get... You want me to go?
[49:45.11]I'll go.
[49:45.65]Okay, you go.
[49:46.87]Wait, hold on.
[49:48.11]I forget what the roles are here.
[49:49.63]I already forget.
[49:50.29]So you... How did you even do that?
[49:53.35]You have to jump to the left and, like, up to the right.
[49:55.57]Just, like, do... Yeah, like that.
[49:56.55]You think you can handle that?
[49:59.12]Hold on.
[50:02.06]So whoever is tracking the laser has... I think that I'm good.
[50:04.84]Now you run...
[50:07.39]back and over.
[50:09.57]You have to go in between into the, like, left platform, right?
[50:12.88]And then the laser will be on me.
[50:14.22]Then you go from the left platform under the laser.
[50:16.40]Okay.
[50:16.70]And you should have plenty of time to make it.
[50:18.34]I'm going.
[50:18.74]Ready?
[50:20.02]Go.
[50:26.52]Oh, you maybe should have given it another second.
[50:28.84]No, if this game's controls, where any... Just stay right there.
[50:34.75]Holy shit.
[50:35.55]I'm staying right there, but if I let go of the down on my thumb stick, I'm dead.
[50:40.87]Just don't do that.
[50:43.47]Hold on.
[50:46.19]You just stay there while I figure my life out, okay?
[50:49.64]Yeah, I'll just hang out here.
[50:51.60]While you beat the game for us, I'll be here.
[50:53.42]Okay.
[50:54.32]Okay.
[50:57.80]That's what I told you to do the first time.
[51:00.54]This finicky, this finicky fucking wall jump is seriously giving me so much stress.
[51:05.44]If it just worked, if the wall- Get this game back in the fucking drawing board, EA, whoever made this game.
[51:11.45]The wall jump sucks.
[51:14.35]It's fine.
[51:15.71]The stupid wall jump's a piece of shit, is what it is.
[51:20.38]I got the laser.
[51:22.18]Who made this game?
[51:22.75]We're good.
[51:24.23]Probably like one guy.
[51:25.55]No, it was like 30 guys.
[51:29.03]Probably one man.
[51:31.80]This fucking wall jump sucks.
[51:34.10]Let's be real.
[51:36.44]We've crested to phase two of Bloody Traplin now.
[51:41.10]Oh, you motherfucker.
[51:43.18]Okay, I'll be the guy.
[51:44.28]No, no, stay there.
[51:45.15]I ain't gonna let a piece of shit wall jump mess me up.
[51:49.75]Watch this.
[51:50.15]Oop.
[52:02.60]Left.
[52:03.68]Not right.
[52:04.42]No, you do it.
[52:04.96]It's fucking impossible.
[52:05.66]Okay, I'll do it.
[52:06.64]I'll do it.
[52:07.00]This wall jump, the wall jump is seriously, like, I would rather throw up in my own mouth.
[52:10.82]I'd rather throw up into the air and fucking drink it like a fountain than do this wall jump again.
[52:16.10]Lie on my goddamn back and puke into my own mouth.
[52:18.28]My turn.
[52:20.21]Alright, I'm coming.
[52:21.19]Oh, well.
[52:22.51]Guess I'll be waiting here just a moment longer.
[52:24.07]Dude, take a page out of, like, Mario.
[52:26.21]Like, what is this wall jump?
[52:31.50]We're having some flashbacks to, like, 2014.
[52:33.84]You do this piece of dogshit wall jump.
[52:37.38]Okay, hold on.
[52:41.38]I'm just trying to think if there's, like, another... That's how you do it, but, like, jumping from wall to wall is, like, seriously, like, scraping your ass on sandpaper.
[52:50.44]Okay, um, hmm.
[52:54.70]I'm gonna be the guy that lures the laser away.
[52:57.00]You're gonna go to the top.
[52:58.03]I'm gonna be the guy that stands there.
[52:59.77]Okay, and I'll be the one that fails.
[53:02.17]Alright.
[53:02.83]Is that agreeable?
[53:04.13]Where is it?
[53:04.53]Here?
[53:05.21]Right there.
[53:05.69]Okay.
[53:06.31]Go for it.
[53:09.50]Hang on.
[53:10.24]Hold on.
[53:10.88]Gotta get my wits.
[53:11.98]So you have to go up the middle, around the side.
[53:15.12]Here's what I'm gonna do.
[53:15.76]I'm gonna try something different.
[53:16.70]We're gonna try taking it a little slower.
[53:18.32]It's the angriest streamer you've ever seen.
[53:23.25]Okay, ready?
[53:24.53]Three, two, one.
[53:28.00]Good luck with this thing.
[53:28.68]Oh, I missed.
[53:29.28]I messed it up.
[53:31.44]I didn't even want to give it a try.
[53:33.16]Hold on.
[53:34.80]Not mad yet.
[53:37.54]Not mad yet.
[53:38.08]Not using a death adder.
[53:43.83]Guys, it's a little sloppy.
[53:45.71]I'll just say that.
[53:49.07]Okay.
[53:50.27]So I just have to run.
[53:51.21]This guy gets it.
[53:55.32]Alright.
[53:55.92]Okay.
[53:56.12]Easy.
[53:56.72]Take your time.
[53:57.08]It's that first jump that gets me.
[53:59.66]Three, two, one.
[54:08.83]You enjoying that wall jump?
[54:09.69]You enjoying like running your dick through a paper shredder?
[54:11.69]The wall jump was fine, okay?
[54:12.81]You enjoying like running your penis through a paper shredder?
[54:18.24]That's what it feels like.
[54:26.12]One more time!
[54:26.98]Okay.
[54:28.47]Here we go!
[54:29.19]I got stuck.
[54:33.67]I got... Stop right there.
[54:36.11]You know?
[54:37.61]It didn't kill me.
[54:38.27]We've been here for like 30 straight minutes.
[54:54.65]Did it.
[54:58.04]I did it.
[55:00.52]We were taking one extra jump than we were supposed to.
[55:03.98]There's only two jumps in that wall jump chain.
[55:06.20]We were trying to do three.
[55:08.02]Yeah, because it's stupid.
[55:15.51]Back on the menu.
[55:16.51]We're back at the world map.
[55:17.75]How do we get this one?
[55:18.95]We have to go to nine, I guess.
[55:20.37]Have we even done nine?
[55:22.19]Yeah.
[55:22.83]Zero deaths.
[55:24.14]We have not done nine.
[55:25.58]Yeah, we have.
[55:26.92]Didn't we?
[55:30.25]Have we?
[55:30.83]Yeah.
[55:31.71]Oh, I guess we did.
[55:32.51]There's a secret here somewhere, right?
[55:34.83]Down... I guess?
[55:36.37]I don't know.
[55:38.26]I feel like I can breathe again.
[55:39.56]Like... No, like, I could've... I would've done that.
[55:46.20]Eventually.
[55:48.70]I just, like... Don't even worry about it.
[55:55.52]So how do we get... Oh, shit.
[55:56.80]67 deaths.
[56:01.09]There's got to be more than that.
[56:04.19]We tried the top left platform.
[56:05.33]I didn't do anything.
[56:05.79]I think we did.
[56:07.11]There might be something that you have to do up there.
[56:10.22]I have no idea.
[56:11.28]You want me to play Spore?
[56:17.94]I'm going to play Spore.
[56:19.42]I'm having fun.
[56:20.12]We're enjoying this game.
[56:23.02]Spore will be next week.
[56:24.81]Alright, um...
[56:26.66]If I was a secret, where would I be?
[56:29.34]What about that platform?
[56:30.66]See the bushes down there?
[56:31.92]Yeah.
[56:32.68]There's no way to get down there, though, right?
[56:34.08]It's all solid.
[56:36.76]Well, let me see.
[56:42.22]Unless I can... Can you, like, drop?
[56:46.78]Ah.
[56:48.82]There's a spot with no spikes over here, though.
[56:51.34]You see that little spot?
[56:53.66]I see a tiny little spot right here.
[56:56.40]Oh, boy, oh, boy!
[56:58.60]Secret!
[56:59.78]Super secrets!
[57:00.64]Oh, and I'm dead.
[57:01.68]But it's okay.
[57:06.30]That is kind of amazing, actually.
[57:08.16]What did you... Shit.
[57:10.18]Just beat it.
[57:11.40]Collect the wonderful ingredients.
[57:16.60]Collect the super ingredients.
[57:17.52]Did you push that button?
[57:18.40]Is that what you did?
[57:19.22]Did I press a button?
[57:19.96]I did not press any button.
[57:21.90]Did you watch what just happened when I pushed the button?
[57:25.08]Wait, what did you do?
[57:27.43]I snuck in there and I pressed the button.
[57:31.15]Yeah.
[57:31.27]But there's nothing else to do.
[57:35.11]Shit, why do we keep dying in the same spot?
[57:41.39]This is a teleporter, but... Okay, hold on.
[57:43.17]Easy, easy.
[57:43.77]Can we do anything with this?
[57:45.65]Yeah, don't push it.
[57:47.17]Where does it teleport you?
[57:50.20]Don't go through the... I don't think we go through the teleporter.
[57:52.38]What you have to do is... See the spike wall on the left?
[57:54.44]Yeah.
[57:54.74]It's going to try and kill you.
[57:55.96]Is it?
[57:56.93]Yeah.
[57:57.85]So it's Indiana Jones.
[57:59.07]As soon as you... What were you gonna say?
[58:02.30]I'm sorry.
[58:02.94]I... As soon as I what?
[58:05.84]Why does it only kill me?
[58:07.28]I don't understand.
[58:08.54]It's gotta be like a client-side thing.
[58:11.00]Are you just casually walking through this with no problem?
[58:14.11]No, I mean, I could be having a problem.
[58:15.75]Early access!
[58:17.59]I don't understand what's next, though.
[58:18.47]There's nothing back there?
[58:19.23]There's nothing really here.
[58:20.01]Yeah, something's messed up there.
[58:25.62]Because on my game, there's like a spike wall.
[58:29.76]Hold on.
[58:29.96]Did you go over here and... Um... How?
[58:31.71]Oh, he hasn't pushed Y yet, probably.
[58:48.72]I have to press Y?
[58:49.78]Yeah, see the little golden thing?
[58:52.12]Go up to it and push Y. What golden thing?
[58:54.79]Like the flame?
[58:56.11]Look, right next to me.
[58:57.13]Do you see, like, this little shiny coin?
[59:00.17]Inside of a rock?
[59:01.71]You can't press that.
[59:03.61]You push it.
[59:05.23]I've already pushed it, and that's what keeps killing me over and over again.
[59:08.06]Do I have to do this all over again?
[59:11.40]Look, go up to the yellow thing just there and push Y.
[59:15.28]Etalyx, there ain't no yellow thing here.
[59:18.52]How come I can see it and you can't?
[59:24.66]I don't know.
[59:28.28]I don't understand.
[59:29.10]Maybe early access?
[59:32.25]Maybe?
[59:32.37]Because there's nothing else here.
[59:36.71]I wonder if you have a secret level.
[59:38.23]You're like standing on it.
[59:40.05]There's nothing here.
[59:40.61]Hang on.
[59:41.11]Let's... Hold on.
[59:43.87]No, I was doing it.
[59:45.06]No, no, no, no.
[59:46.58]I want to do it.
[59:47.42]I want to do the thing.
[59:48.22]Oh, you're starting it over?
[59:49.30]Just to see what happens.
[59:55.66]Now is there a yellow thing?
[59:56.93]No.
[59:59.53]No yellow thing.
[60:00.35]You're like right on top of it.
[60:02.71]Oh, well.
[60:03.97]Looks like there's no yellow thing.
[60:05.99]Hold on.
[60:07.39]I can do this.
[60:12.58]I did it.
[60:13.04]Did you just complete something?
[60:16.21]Um... Whoa.
[60:18.01]Alright.
[60:18.91]Apparently that worked.
[60:19.77]Cool.
[60:20.65]It did work.
[60:22.47]There was like an Indiana Jones activator.
[60:24.91]When you cross over the threshold, it shoots the spike wall at you, and you have to race it to the end.
[60:29.87]Really?
[60:31.00]Yeah.
[60:31.18]Well, here's a T2.
[60:33.52]Whatever.
[60:33.88]We got there.
[60:34.34]That's all that matters.
[60:35.22]All that matters is we're here, and here we are.
[60:36.96]Oh, boy.
[60:37.42]Underwater level.
[60:38.54]This is going to be a lot of fun.
[60:40.10]I can't wait for the underwater level.
[60:44.32]This is a good dodge.
[60:45.54]That was a good dodge.
[60:47.22]I don't think this kills you.
[60:50.02]The boulders don't kill you, but the spikes do.
[60:52.80]So how do we open that?
[60:55.01]Oh, that's how.
[60:59.09]That's how, yeah.
[60:59.89]Fall this down.
[61:01.25]Go this way.
[61:02.15]Jump.
[61:02.55]Oh, please.
[61:06.19]Dragged around.
[61:06.99]Oh boy.
[61:09.33]Watch out for the hand.
[61:10.81]So I think I'm going to make the hand drop and then you go.
[61:16.20]What?
[61:16.58]Shit.
[61:20.64]I didn't know that that was me.
[61:22.24]My green guy turned into yellow water.
[61:24.80]Because he changes colors.
[61:27.21]Green?
[61:30.05]I made it down.
[61:30.55]I'm going to slide underneath this.
[61:32.09]Good slide.
[61:34.68]Watch out for those spikes.
[61:35.56]They're there as well.
[61:36.69]Cool.
[61:43.45]What?
[61:46.65]I want to just like... Let me go.
[61:48.53]Don't fall and then jump on that one.
[61:51.97]Oh dear, look at that one!
[61:53.79]Oh, fuck!
[61:54.65]Okay, I have it.
[61:55.37]Okay, I'm gonna stand here for a moment and just kind of look.
[61:59.11]Where are you... You're supposed to ride the boulder.
[62:01.65]You ride the boulder thing?
[62:02.99]I think, yeah, you're right.
[62:09.78]Oh, jeez.
[62:10.30]Do you just walk off?
[62:11.72]Yeah, but we have to ride the ball back.
[62:13.60]Yeah, I know, but how do you get through the ceiling spikes and the other spikes?
[62:19.77]By praying.
[62:23.95]Oh, give me one second.
[62:27.72]Yes, a lot of people are saying Spore.
[62:31.32]Spore has been postponed because Bloody Trapline 2 came out today, and I didn't even know it was coming out, and Etalyx wanted to play it, and we thought it would be fun, so that's what we're doing.
[62:40.52]And plus, Spore was... I'm going to be honest about Spore.
[62:44.02]I feel like Spore is going to be fun for like 30 minutes while I make a monster.
[62:47.94]And then I have to play Spore.
[62:49.45]Which, the actual video game Spore, after the, like, what, like, the second stage of Spore is, like, the fun part?
[62:56.17]And then isn't it just, like, a boring, shitty game?
[62:58.75]Isn't that how it is?
[63:01.35]While I just do that.
[63:04.29]I would love to play Spore and make some creatures, but, like, isn't the video game Spore, like, not that good?
[63:11.44]So, like, why does everybody want it so bad?
[63:14.58]Everyone's like demanding spore, but you guys forget like spore like kind of sucks fuck and I got damn it Okay, I got it.
[63:21.30]I got it Hey, you just we trying to like be a lumberjack on it or something so I kind of we trying to like walk on it walk it down kind of Now I was talking about spore
[63:44.12]I like Spore.
[63:45.08]Where do you go after this, though?
[63:46.67]Okay, so you have to go up.
[63:48.11]How do you raise... Does the first button raise that, uh...
[63:54.15]You see, like, the vertical pillar?
[63:56.21]Huh.
[63:56.95]Maybe.
[63:57.07]On the top right.
[63:58.27]Let's see.
[63:58.59]Because it's definitely walled off.
[64:00.91]I'm coming in.
[64:02.17]Don't die to me!
[64:05.23]Okay, you're good.
[64:06.56]Wow, okay, so you have... More secrets.
[64:08.60]So you just... Watch out for those spikes.
[64:09.96]You're gonna slide and hit that button.
[64:12.10]Let me just try to get over there first.
[64:15.74]Not be like an idiot.
[64:16.74]Okay.
[64:17.04]So what did you just open?
[64:20.47]What have you done?
[64:20.91]I didn't even see what happened.
[64:21.85]What did it do?
[64:23.28]Uh, so... The button... Open... Like, lowers a platform and makes the boulders... Okay, so it makes it so I won't get hit by one of the boulders.
[64:32.38]So you have to do that and drop one of the boulders while I move, right?
[64:35.98]Don't you just jump up and out?
[64:38.20]Yeah.
[64:39.35]Oh, no, you have to use the boulder.
[64:40.53]You have to jump... Yeah.
[64:43.37]Wait, what?
[64:43.65]You have to jump on the boulder first when it comes through, and then off of the boulder, wall jump to the top.
[64:50.23]Oh.
[64:51.79]God.
[64:53.07]Okay.
[64:53.51]Well, let's... Yeah.
[64:54.63]Alright.
[64:55.55]I'm gonna give it a try.
[64:57.81]So first you gotta make it all the way back over here.
[64:59.87]I gotta make it back and not make any dumb mistakes, but that's gonna happen, because you make dumb mistakes.
[65:04.42]Okay.
[65:04.56]I'm just gonna hang out right here.
[65:05.82]I swear to God.
[65:07.06]I swear to God.
[65:07.58]Like, every time, I'm gonna make that stupid mistake every time.
[65:11.70]You just hang out there for a minute.
[65:13.72]I'll be here.
[65:21.42]Okay.
[65:23.09]That just almost crushed me.
[65:24.45]That just rolled in here and almost killed me.
[65:30.11]I didn't even attach to the wall.
[65:31.59]It didn't attach to the wall.
[65:33.23]I'm going to make the wall jump criticism again.
[65:35.25]I'm going to.
[65:36.35]I'm not going to do it, but you know what I'm going to say.
[65:49.30]So somebody pointed out what would make this absolutely intolerable.
[65:53.74]Breath mechanic.
[65:55.48]Alright, so before you get crushed, don't jump yet.
[66:00.11]Let's just watch and see how it's gonna go.
[66:01.43]Let's see how it goes.
[66:03.71]So you're gonna press that button.
[66:05.76]Yeah, I just stand on the button, and I'm gonna do it as long as you need to, just... You can get pushed by the boulder a little bit, so... Don't panic.
[66:12.85]Um, but you need to wall jump on the top right, slide down onto the boulder, then use it to springboard up.
[66:19.84]Yeah, right?
[66:20.38]I mean... Wait, wait, wait.
[66:24.00]Let me... Where is the opening?
[66:26.44]Is the opening... The opening's to the right.
[66:27.90]I think it's just directly up from the spikes.
[66:30.23]Yes.
[66:31.90]It's like here.
[66:33.18]It's like up here, right?
[66:34.02]Yeah.
[66:34.78]Yeah, but you have to jump from the boulder to get up there.
[66:37.72]Okay, so... I think.
[66:38.99]So you're gonna let it go.
[66:40.61]Ready?
[66:41.25]Here comes the next one.
[66:43.87]Um, okay.
[66:45.39]I guess I have to time it better?
[66:47.54]Three, two, one.
[66:50.38]Oh, God.
[66:54.36]Okay, okay.
[66:56.02]Now I gotta get all the way back there.
[66:57.50]And now I have to pee, too.
[67:00.17]You know when you just have to piss and it's not fun and everything sucks?
[67:02.77]And you're just shaking your leg?
[67:04.22]Yeah, you're just... How long can I hold it for?
[67:06.56]I...
[67:11.76]sucks.
[67:12.72]Alright, let's try this again.
[67:14.40]So I need to get on top and then jump.
[67:15.86]Well, wait.
[67:17.40]Yeah, you need to, like, jump on the boulder and then immediately jump up.
[67:20.26]Alright, you gotta tell me which one am I gonna jump on.
[67:23.00]Which boulder.
[67:24.59]I'll tell you that, but you're gonna use the boulder, then you have to wall jump left, like, right to left, basically.
[67:29.17]So I'm gonna off the boulder, right to left.
[67:32.43]Like, yeah, you have to climb up to the top somehow.
[67:34.35]I don't know if you can do that with just a single jump.
[67:36.57]We'll give it a try.
[67:37.26]Here we go.
[67:38.10]Alright, the next boulder.
[67:39.66]Whoops.
[67:41.34]The...
[67:43.12]It still worked.
[67:43.68]Alright, let's get it.
[67:44.44]Still worked.
[67:45.84]Got it.
[67:47.22]Got the gem.
[67:47.68]Alright.
[67:48.64]Okay.
[67:48.98]That means we can get out of here.
[67:50.11]Watch out for the spikes.
[67:52.39]That is instant.
[67:53.83]Start over.
[67:54.35]Okay, we're good.
[67:55.93]You got really lucky there, honestly.
[67:58.75]I know.
[67:59.45]I would have just dropped into the spikes.
[68:06.33]Do you have to leave?
[68:06.85]Okay, I was going to say, do you have to leave too?
[68:09.30]There's another button on the map that we did not hit, apparently.
[68:14.15]Is that all the secret levels in the first area, though?
[68:18.57]I don't... Did we do level 10?
[68:20.21]I guess we did.
[68:20.89]Yeah, we did.
[68:21.55]Because that goes right to the boat.
[68:23.55]I think that's all the secret levels.
[68:25.46]Alright, well, what's next?
[68:27.50]So, if there's 20 levels in the game, that's only half of... Theoretically, the early access.
[68:33.64]So, this is what else is there.
[68:35.08]I think this is the next area, right?
[68:36.80]Yeah.
[68:38.10]We missed a button at the bottom.
[68:39.94]Yeah, so that's what they're saying in my chat, too.
[68:41.70]They're saying that there's an extra button down there.
[68:44.54]Really?
[68:45.80]I doubt that it is worth checking out, but we can look at it anyway.
[68:49.08]We're here.
[68:49.46]Might as well.
[68:52.95]Unless we're getting trolled.
[68:54.79]I see it.
[68:55.37]Where is it?
[68:56.01]Oh, I do see that.
[68:56.73]Okay, so how do we get there?
[68:58.97]Oh, no.
[69:00.25]Oh, no.
[69:00.59]Oh, no.
[69:07.05]Okay.
[69:07.91]What?
[69:08.05]What's going on here?
[69:09.37]There we go.
[69:15.33]Keep going.
[69:16.72]Easy.
[69:17.44]Don't get yourself crushed.
[69:18.72]Alright, so how do we get... Like this?
[69:24.68]Oh, like that.
[69:25.18]Alright, I pressed it.
[69:26.26]What did it do?
[69:27.96]It released a spike pit.
[69:29.88]I think it's just to make it easier for you to fail.
[69:33.15]So you don't have to go all the way around on the left.
[69:35.45]You can just, like, here, I'll die.
[69:37.45]Wait, what?
[69:38.79]Look, you released the spike barrier.
[69:41.55]Okay.
[69:43.63]I don't even know what killed you.
[69:45.64]I got squished between a rock and a wall.
[69:47.34]Okay, watch this.
[69:51.20]You see?
[69:51.48]Oh.
[69:52.17]Did you not see it?
[69:53.15]Oh, okay.
[69:54.01]Alright, yeah.
[69:54.67]Well, let's just go with that.
[69:56.09]It was just a super secret shortcut.
[69:58.41]Ooh, cool.
[69:59.95]Okay, desert level, let's do it.
[70:02.13]But I have to pee really badly.
[70:04.11]Okay.
[70:04.39]Can I pee first?
[70:05.77]Yeah, let's just look at the level.
[70:07.11]I won't do it.
[70:07.61]Just let's look at it.
[70:09.37]Don't do it.
[70:10.07]I need to pee.
[70:10.51]I'm not going to do it.
[70:11.33]I just want to see it.
[70:12.13]You can definitely entertain everybody.
[70:14.51]Oh, boy.
[70:15.05]This is going to take us a while, so this is going to be fine.
[70:16.69]I'll be right back.
[70:17.67]Oh, boy.
[70:18.59]I'm going to put my credit card number on the screen.
[70:22.05]Well, let me get on eBay real quick.
[70:25.15]What is this text?
[70:26.43]I don't even know what this is, but this is my Be Right Back screen.
[70:30.29]I don't even know what that was.
[70:32.42]I'll be right back.
[71:49.14]Wait, am I supposed to be talking to you guys too?
[71:50.81]Am I supposed to be talking to you?
[71:53.13]Huh?
[71:55.55]Did he leave me unmuted?
[71:58.87]I don't believe this.
[72:02.24]This is an embarrassment.
[72:04.94]Actually, I gotta be right back too.
[72:09.66]Boop!
[72:13.16]Wait, what?
[72:37.94]Oh my god.
[72:38.68]Hey, what happened?
[72:43.48]I had the disconnect.
[72:44.96]Why?
[72:46.44]For some reason this level was maxing out my computer.
[72:51.65]Apparently my crappy computer can't handle bloody trap land.
[72:54.53]Hold on, I need to show everybody this because this is like fucking crazy.
[72:59.36]Hold on.
[73:00.92]You want to see how intense I've been getting in this game?
[73:04.74]Are you, like, profusely sweating?
[73:06.44]Dude, just look at this.
[73:08.12]Look at, it's like, it's like my whole entire body.
[73:11.32]It's like my whole, down my side.
[73:14.78]Look at this.
[73:16.44]It's like I'm just sitting here, like, sweating.
[73:20.54]Holy shit.
[73:24.90]Are you kidding me right now?
[73:26.22]Did I, have I been, like, sprinting?
[73:33.07]You can't possibly be that sweaty.
[73:34.91]Oh, no, you have no idea.
[73:36.51]That is unbelievable.
[73:41.70]That is an unbelievable amount of sweat.
[73:44.76]Can you re-invite me?
[73:47.26]Uh, yeah, hold on.
[73:51.85]I'm gonna give you a new invite.
[73:54.73]Does he piss?
[73:55.77]Yeah, it looks like somebody... I did that as, like, a joke.
[74:04.80]It looks like in the bathroom, I put water under my arms as a joke for the stream.
[74:10.22]I swear to, I promise you, I swear to God I did not do that.
[74:14.94]I'm just like a disgusting fucking human being.
[74:18.78]Did you get my invite?
[74:22.61]Yeah, questionable.
[74:24.83]Questionable.
[74:25.95]Yeah.
[74:27.11]Because things are looking kind of weird.
[74:30.93]Turn something down on your graphics, maybe?
[74:33.74]Uh, not that kind of weird.
[74:35.50]Weird?
[74:36.60]Here, uh, you might have to be at the, like, character select again.
[74:40.05]Alright.
[74:41.77]Hold that thought.
[74:42.79]One sec.
[74:43.73]If this, I hope this doesn't, like, erase our progress.
[74:46.53]Oh god, imagine if it did.
[74:48.37]Yeah.
[74:49.99]I'm assuming it won't.
[74:51.97]I would, I would be shocked if it did, but it is early access.
[74:54.44]Who knows?
[74:54.86]I'm actually feeling kind of sweaty myself right now.
[74:57.78]Are you?
[74:58.96]Yeah.
[75:00.20]Okay, let me just get to the main menu.

[75:33.20]I don't know what it was about it.
[75:34.54]Turn some of your graphics down?
[75:35.84]There's only one graphics setting and it does nothing.
[75:38.52]Really?
[75:40.20]Well, we're going to beat these levels quick then.
[75:42.37]Alright, I'm just going to restart my stream.
[75:45.11]I already died.
[75:48.37]Where's the clown makeup?
[75:51.45]Good question.
[75:52.07]I can go down here.
[75:55.67]Hang on.
[75:56.31]Wait for me.
[75:57.58]Just seeing how fast you die in the quicksand.
[75:59.84]Okay.
[76:00.34]How do you do this?
[76:04.34]Oh, okay.
[76:05.86]Just gonna be not a shitty.
[76:08.88]Is this DLC or an update?
[76:10.12]No, this is Bloody Trapland 2.
[76:12.75]It is currently in early access.
[76:15.79]What we are playing right now is the only part of the game that is available.
[76:20.55]There are two zones that are available right now, I believe.
[76:23.71]20-ish, a little 20+, maybe like 22, 24 levels are available at the moment.
[76:28.04]Yeah, we don't know for sure that there's only 20, but they said a third of the content, and they're planning on 60 levels, so we have to assume that there's 20.
[76:36.05]Plus bonus levels, I guess.
[76:38.15]Because I don't think... There's 10 levels per world.
[76:40.35]Mm-hmm.
[76:42.39]Uh, give me one second.
[76:43.79]Hey, Never Trust a Purple, thank you for the 10 bucks.
[76:45.41]Okay, yeah, I think I'm good.
[76:46.73]I was told this is the place to get exclusive new Art of Stealth content.
[76:49.95]What the fuck is this shitty game?
[76:51.59]I'm sorry about that, yeah, my exclusive Art of Stealth, uh, content, uh, the contract is up, so I'm sorry.
[76:58.24]Alright.
[76:59.62]How did I die?
[77:01.29]Did you jump on me?
[77:02.40]Were you not a nice person?
[77:03.96]I did.
[77:04.44]It was not on purpose, though.
[77:06.28]This is Etalyx, for those of you wondering.
[77:08.66]What?
[77:08.88]It's been like two hours.
[77:11.08]Well, there's potentially new people that came in that are just like, oh, who's this cool gamer that I'm listening to?
[77:14.70]It's been like two full hours.
[77:17.16]It's been an hour and a half.
[77:18.90]No, it's been like an hour and 20 minutes.
[77:21.57]I said an hour and a half.
[77:22.43]Is that not close enough?
[77:23.33]What kind of clock are you looking at?
[77:25.51]I'm sorry.
[77:26.29]Oh, no.
[77:27.67]Alright, let's go.
[77:33.20]What?
[77:33.78]I don't think we can do that.
[77:35.04]I think you have to go this way.
[77:38.12]Wall jump is actually pretty good in this game.
[77:39.46]It's pretty satisfying.
[77:41.90]Is that a joke?
[77:43.51]Yeah.
[77:44.59]Yeah.
[77:45.09]I slide down and then... Why?
[77:50.61]Oh, don't worry, Etalyx.
[77:51.45]I'm just beating this shit for us.
[77:52.75]Why?
[77:54.39]I didn't even get to play that level, basically.
[77:58.18]Those are all my deaths.
[77:59.90]This used to be a what-the-heck-new stream.
[78:04.52]What the heck?
[78:06.06]Alright, there's a secret here.
[78:08.26]This is a secret level.
[78:10.18]Okay.
[78:10.72]I do like that they show you... I like that they show you on the map where to expect secrets so you know where to look.
[78:21.35]It's gotta be by that cactus at the bottom.
[78:23.65]So you gotta... How do you do this one, then?
[78:25.76]You gotta go right... That looked like you made it.
[78:31.34]I think you gotta start the slide early.
[78:34.34]Can it slide over?
[78:35.04]I don't think it can slide over you either.
[78:36.26]Alright, one at a time.
[78:38.97]One at a time.
[78:40.11]Oh my god.
[78:44.97]I'm freaking out, but I made it.
[78:45.99]No, I didn't.
[78:46.29]Okay, I made it.
[78:47.59]I don't want to do that again.
[78:48.25]Too bad, because you're gonna have to do it again.
[78:52.09]Oh, this wind.
[78:54.51]Oh god, no.
[78:55.49]Oh, there's wind.
[78:56.41]There's wind.
[78:57.07]Desert mechanics.
[78:58.74]And I'm gonna get killed by this spike right here, because this wind.
[79:01.50]Well, no.
[79:02.18]I said that.
[79:02.70]Be careful.
[79:03.10]There's wind.
[79:12.28]What is going on?
[79:13.32]Okay, there's no wind up here.
[79:15.52]There's only wind in those little wind spots.
[79:18.34]That's what was freaking me out.
[79:21.79]Holy... How did you make... I don't know.
[79:27.39]Let's go.
[79:27.75]I made it too.
[79:28.29]I made it too.
[79:28.97]Oh, what are we doing?
[79:29.95]What are we doing?
[79:30.65]There's a secret in here.
[79:31.55]You didn't find the secret.
[79:33.71]Go back.
[79:34.43]I know where it is.
[79:35.47]I know where it is.
[79:36.71]Go back.
[79:37.01]We're doing that again.
[79:37.93]We're getting the secret.
[79:39.33]There's a button too, apparently.
[79:41.47]Where's the button?
[79:42.51]The button probably opens the door.
[79:43.73]I don't know.
[79:47.78]I'm so sorry.
[79:48.44]I lose.
[79:49.24]I'm so sorry.
[79:50.14]What about to the left?
[79:52.07]Looks like a little area.
[79:57.71]Jesus.
[79:59.19]I don't know.
[80:07.02]What about down?
[80:09.46]I feel like that's just going to kill you.
[80:11.38]You can try it though.
[80:12.48]I'm going to try it.
[80:15.31]Oh my god, it didn't work.
[80:16.23]It didn't do the thing.
[80:17.29]It's gotta be something to the bottom right, because look, there's like a... There's like a warning sign and a spike, but how else would you hit the spike if you didn't, like, dive under there?
[80:31.78]I'm pretty sure that I was close.
[80:33.16]Do you see the thing in the lower right that's, like, pointing down?
[80:36.84]There's a thing pointing down.
[80:39.12]Um... You see that, right?
[80:43.49]Pointing down?
[80:44.65]You don't see the sign pointing down?
[80:46.79]Down there?
[80:48.70]Nope.
[80:49.58]Oh my fucking god.
[80:52.10]There's a sign that says, down that way.
[80:54.00]I'm going to try bottom left one more time.
[80:57.88]I think I almost got it.
[80:59.60]You do that while I do this.
[81:07.50]See?
[81:07.82]Down.
[81:08.62]What happens if I do this?
[81:10.42]Got it.
[81:10.70]Well, you found it.
[81:11.68]I was wrong.
[81:13.03]That all doesn't shoot a gun.
[81:15.03]Wait, where's the gun?
[81:15.79]It shoots a bullet.
[81:18.45]Maybe you have to, like, aim it between the... Aim it?
[81:23.21]Oh, like, make it where it hits the sword-swinging thing.
[81:27.43]I don't know.
[81:27.79]Or maybe somebody has to jump on it.
[81:30.72]Can you jump on bullets in this game?
[81:32.06]Is that a thing?
[81:32.80]Alex, are you asking if you can jump on bullets?
[81:35.10]Yeah, I'm asking if you can jump on bullets.
[81:37.58]What do you think this is?
[81:38.46]Can you do that in real life?
[81:41.44]Of course you can't do that in Bloody Trapland.
[81:43.28]It's a very realistic, real-life game.
[81:44.90]Well, that's got to be there for some reason, though.
[81:47.14]This better not be just a laugh-out-loud button.
[81:48.80]That would be so dumb.
[81:53.90]Where's the secret, then?
[81:54.84]Hold on.
[81:57.40]If I wasn't failing so miserably, I think I've got an idea.
[82:01.04]Can you drift left with the wind?
[82:10.78]I'm going to help you out here.
[82:12.68]I can't get beyond... You know you're safe right here, right?
[82:18.35]It can't hit you.
[82:19.49]Yeah, but that's not the problem.
[82:20.45]The problem is sliding.
[82:21.35]I want to go left.
[82:23.29]You better not get it on your first try.
[82:24.61]I'm going to be really mad.
[82:25.75]I would have got it on the first try right there if you didn't just jinx me.
[82:29.11]You owe me a Coke.
[82:32.23]Jinx, you owe me a Coke.
[82:32.87]Okay.
[82:37.45]I'll get it.
[82:37.81]Don't worry, I'll get it.
[82:39.37]No, I'll get it.
[82:40.28]No, I'll get it.
[82:41.82]I'm definitely gonna get it now.
[82:44.20]Oh, no, I'll get it.
[82:46.92]No.
[82:47.68]No, you got it.
[82:48.54]Um... What?
[82:49.64]Okay.
[82:50.36]What the hell does that do?
[82:59.19]Can you come down here, too?
[83:00.45]You can, look, just start... I can't go down.
[83:05.17]Can you make it, like, move?
[83:07.55]Can you, like, jump out of there?
[83:09.17]Just stand on the thing.
[83:10.79]Stand on what thing?
[83:12.86]Go, like, a little bit left.
[83:16.02]Just a teeny bit left.
[83:17.30]Nope.
[83:17.76]Too far.
[83:18.48]What are you talking about?
[83:19.38]A little bit right.
[83:20.40]Just a little bit there.
[83:23.95]I don't even know what you mean.
[83:25.67]What did you just do?
[83:27.11]I have no idea what's happening.
[83:31.99]I think it's another buggy gold thing.
[83:32.94]Can you see the secret area down there?
[83:34.38]I can see the secret area, but there's an empty cask.
[83:36.42]There's nothing there.
[83:37.50]Yeah, but there's like a button you can push that releases this horizontal panel.
[83:43.31]Really?
[83:44.47]So, I don't know.
[83:45.39]I was trying to get you down there, but it didn't work.
[83:47.23]You were just like moving back and forth.
[83:48.90]Let's go down there.
[83:51.81]What in the name of God?
[83:52.93]Like, honesty.
[83:54.11]Honesty.
[83:55.29]Honesty.
[83:56.45]I'm giving you honesty here, guys.
[83:57.75]No more lies here, okay?
[83:59.19]Just honesty only.
[84:00.21]Okay, I'm in here.
[84:03.04]What do I do in here?
[84:07.22]Is there not, like, a thing moving for you?
[84:08.90]Like, this thing moving?
[84:10.34]See, you just got up.
[84:11.02]Now you can't get back down.
[84:11.80]Good job.
[84:13.36]How did you even get down there?
[84:15.20]How did I just get down there?
[84:16.42]What the fuck is happening?
[84:17.98]Okay, I think we're chalking this up as a move on.
[84:21.66]Because I don't know if there's anything we can do about this.
[84:24.99]Okay, well, there's got to be something to do with the button to the right.
[84:28.41]Do I have to shoot the button?
[84:29.63]Shoot the bullet in there?
[84:31.01]But that's a laugh out loud button.
[84:32.83]That doesn't do anything.
[84:34.25]But look, there's two very bullet-sized crevices between the, like, swinging blades.
[84:39.91]I mean, there is, but... Okay, come down here and shoot something, theoretically.
[84:43.56]Alright, you stay down there.
[84:46.02]I'm gonna go for an honesty here.
[84:49.86]No, I'm not.
[84:50.38]No, I'm not.
[84:52.30]No, I'm not.
[84:54.95]We'll come back to it.
[84:56.05]Well, I was there!
[84:57.43]No.
[84:58.15]In all honesty... Fine.
[84:59.41]Fine.
[85:01.17]There could be like a bugged-ad house.
[85:03.11]Bugged-ad house?
[85:05.27]Bugged ass out... What's wrong with me?
[85:10.07]Bugged out ass.
[85:13.79]Dag... Ass-dactyl.
[85:16.15]Ass-dactyl.
[85:17.23]Is that like a pterodactyl with a big ass for a face?
[85:21.61]A lot of wind.
[85:24.88]Please.
[85:28.57]You gotta use the drift.
[85:29.35]You gotta fly.
[85:30.73]You gotta use the drift.
[85:32.33]What is it?
[85:32.69]Pacific Rim?
[85:34.29]Yeah.
[85:35.37]Feel the drift.
[85:36.10]Was Michael Keaton in that movie?
[85:37.66]Tokyo.
[85:38.26]Drift.
[85:39.36]Michael Keaton's in that movie, right?
[85:40.62]Michael Keaton.
[85:42.21]No, I don't think so.
[85:43.41]It's like one guy you won't remember, and then another guy you won't remember, and then Idris Elba.
[85:49.61]I'm sorry, I just killed you.
[85:50.73]Isn't GLaDOS in that movie?
[85:51.77]I love that movie because GLaDOS is in it.
[85:53.59]Yes, GLaDOS is in that movie.
[85:55.18]Yeah, does she go... She goes... Does she do something like that?
[86:00.70]No.
[86:00.96]She's so funny.
[86:04.62]Fuck.
[86:05.42]How did I live?
[86:06.52]I bounced off the spikes.
[86:09.22]Um, any secrets on this level, huh?
[86:12.04]Oh my god.
[86:14.32]And Pacific Rim does like, do they get in touch with GLaDOS and does she say, I have some of this cake.
[86:21.77]I have some of this cake.
[86:24.61]Stop distracting myself and play the game.
[86:26.79]Like, what the heck?
[86:28.39]What the heck, man?
[86:30.37]What the heck?
[86:37.16]Jesus.
[86:39.66]What the heck, man?
[86:40.98]Is it bad that I'm happy when you die, so I have another chance to be the winner?
[86:46.35]I feel that way, too.
[86:49.39]Don't get... You were so scared.
[86:51.15]You freaked me out.
[86:52.53]I made it.
[86:53.47]You were so scared.
[86:55.99]I saw you dropping in.
[86:57.79]It's okay.
[87:00.13]Oh, look at this guy.
[87:03.85]Oh, come on.
[87:08.54]Is this the end of the level?
[87:12.81]That small sound effect says no.
[87:15.63]No, it's not, actually.
[87:19.59]Shit.
[87:20.63]Oh, well.
[87:21.37]I tried.
[87:21.75]It's all up to you.
[87:31.15]It's all up to me.
[87:31.81]Here we go.
[87:32.89]Good.
[87:35.49]It's all you, man.
[87:36.79]It's all you.
[87:44.09]Where is the end of the level, actually?
[87:45.59]It just goes off screen.
[87:46.61]Can you jump over this thing?
[87:48.29]Okay, you can.
[87:51.26]Do I just keep running?
[87:53.52]Okay.
[87:54.08]I guess I was scared to go off the ledge.
[87:56.58]I'm nervous.
[87:57.30]Everything's trying to kill you in this game.
[87:59.76]It is bloody trap line.
[88:03.12]We didn't deserve Spore.
[88:06.36]What is with you guys and Spore?
[88:10.21]I'm gonna play Spore.
[88:11.29]See, I thought when Spore came out that everyone thought it sucked.
[88:14.15]Spore, like, does suck.
[88:15.99]Okay.
[88:16.75]That's the thing.
[88:17.49]Spore, like... Spore sucks.
[88:21.75]I love that sound effect.
[88:23.25]With, like, the little... Yeah.
[88:24.81]But that one... The one on the right doesn't do it.
[88:26.51]It's just the one on the left.
[88:28.71]Oh, you're right.
[88:29.16]It does.
[88:31.98]Oh, you... I almost... I'm on fire.
[88:35.60]You, like, burn in this level?
[88:37.60]Oh, the direct sunlight.
[88:40.28]I'm alright.
[88:40.82]I just stood in direct sunlight.
[88:42.46]I got a good tan.
[88:43.44]I'm good.
[88:48.45]There's got to be a secret down here.
[88:49.63]Look at this wood thing.
[88:50.87]What did you say about Spore?
[88:56.57]Be honest with yourselves, guys.
[88:58.37]Spore is not a good game.
[89:01.65]Spore was very revolutionary and was very cool for creation and... It's burning.
[89:09.37]The character creator, the monster creator, it's very cool.
[89:11.77]It's very cool.
[89:12.33]Yeah, it was creative, but... The video game Spore.
[89:15.33]Who cares?
[89:15.77]Like, Etalyx.
[89:16.95]So Spore the idea is a great game, right?
[89:20.07]Okay, yeah.
[89:20.64]Spore the video game is awful, right?
[89:23.24]Mm-hmm.
[89:23.70]Okay.
[89:24.26]So when you combine a very, very cool idea with, like, a bad piece of shit awful video game, like, it's gonna be, like, a fun experience just because it's so creative, right?
[89:35.21]Yeah.
[89:35.31]Yeah.
[89:35.72]Like, it's unique.
[89:36.44]It's something you hadn't seen before.
[89:37.72]But... But then... You realize... That there's nothing under that beautiful shell.
[89:45.14]Yeah.
[89:45.38]Guys, it's only so many times... It's what's on the inside that counts.
[89:48.14]But there's only so many times you can, like, dance with the monster.
[89:51.48]Remember?
[89:51.80]It was like, go find the other group of monsters and dance!
[89:55.28]Like, that's fun for, like, 30 minutes.
[89:58.66]You know they have, like, a whole game about that now?
[90:00.68]Do they really?
[90:01.59]It's not, like, about evolving your, uh...
[90:04.90]It's not about evolving your guy anymore, it's about, like, becoming... different pieces of the universe, and then they dance.
[90:11.56]No, doesn't it turn into, like, a... a real-time strategy game?
[90:15.37]Like, at the halfway through or something weird?
[90:17.13]Yes.
[90:17.77]And it's a really bad real-time str- It's not a good real-time strategy game?
[90:20.41]They try to make, like, a different game type for every single... phase.
[90:27.76]How did you get over there?
[90:28.54]I don't know, but I think I'm burning.
[90:31.30]Pressing a button.
[90:31.70]I don't know what it does.
[90:33.28]Is it a laugh out loud button?
[90:34.02]I don't know.
[90:34.58]What does it do?
[90:35.46]I think it just made it easier, because now you can hide under... Never mind.
[90:40.62]It was a mirage.
[90:41.34]It was a mirage in the sand.
[90:44.86]Shit.
[90:46.28]Look, Spore came out a long time ago.
[90:50.47]I'm not holding Spore to today's standards.
[90:52.69]No way.
[90:53.75]That would be unfair.
[90:55.41]I'm holding Spore to, like... If I play Spore, I'm probably only gonna... Unless I... I mean... Like, what was even in the game besides, like, the random... Like, oh, I just... I just won, but I burnt to death.
[91:16.01]I die on that every single... You just die over and over again on it.
[91:20.13]Yep.
[91:22.55]I've had it.
[91:24.60]Oh, my God.
[91:25.36]I did it.
[91:25.72]I already beat it.
[91:27.62]How do you get up that one?
[91:28.68]I don't understand.
[91:29.70]What am I missing?
[91:30.26]I'm going to watch you.
[91:30.94]I'm just going to study.
[91:31.64]Just watch me.
[91:32.14]I'll show you how it's done.
[91:37.94]Oh, I was doing it the wrong the whole time.
[91:39.86]Okay.
[91:40.93]Yep.
[91:42.49]It's okay because I freaked out and I fucked up the wall jump.
[91:45.63]This is miserable, but it's fun.
[91:50.53]It's miserable.
[91:51.69]It's a very miserable fun.
[91:59.95]Got it.
[92:00.53]Okay.
[92:01.65]Whatever, I got further on that run.
[92:04.25]I'm continuing to burn and explode while you, uh... There's nothing wrong with Spore.
[92:07.91]But I just, I guess, just... I'm just a little curious as to why everybody wants it so bad.
[92:14.96]I don't know.
[92:15.58]It's a fun game.
[92:17.05]You know why?
[92:17.67]You want the real reason why?
[92:20.97]What?
[92:22.03]It's because it takes everything that's funny about character creators and makes the game more or less about it.
[92:32.20]So it's like one big character creator joke.
[92:36.00]What's the third phase in Spore?
[92:37.06]First phase is like the, you run around, you eat people as like a little Spore thing.
[92:41.10]Second phase is you walk around and dance and mate.
[92:43.84]What's the third phase?
[92:44.50]The fourth phase is space.
[92:45.64]What is the fourth one?
[92:46.94]I thought that was... War?
[92:48.92]Don't you like go to war or something?
[92:49.82]When does it become a real-time strategy one?
[92:52.60]There's like four... Oh god, I'm sorry.
[92:54.44]There's four phases.
[92:55.56]I should have ducked.
[92:57.02]This one looks like really easy.
[93:01.25]This one looks really easy.
[93:03.83]It kind of does, actually.
[93:04.97]Yeah, you go to war in Spore.
[93:12.46]I love how we said it's easy and we both just can't even get back to the first part.
[93:15.12]Alright, move.
[93:16.66]You gotta move.
[93:19.06]I moved!
[93:19.54]You can't sit there that long, Etalyx.
[93:20.98]That's not how it works.
[93:26.37]Okay, wait a minute.
[93:27.63]There's two ways to go here.
[93:30.70]Oh, don't go that way.
[93:31.90]How do you get through that?
[93:33.52]How do you get through that?
[93:34.70]The top one looks way better.
[93:36.62]The top one looks possible.
[93:37.84]The bottom one looks not possible.
[93:42.13]I love belly flopping into the stupid blade.
[93:44.83]I'm going to wait until... One, two, one, two.
[93:48.21]Oh, jod.
[93:50.17]Oh, jod.
[93:50.73]Wow, did you see that one?
[93:52.35]No, I didn't.
[93:52.85]What did you do?
[93:53.23]It was beautiful.
[93:53.99]It was perfect.
[93:54.63]I just barely... One pixel.
[93:55.77]One pixel.
[93:58.33]Got it by one pixel.
[93:59.77]Apparently I suck at this game.
[94:01.01]Hey, thank you, Gummy Monk, for the five dollars.
[94:04.73]Bad game, but excellent comedy fodder.
[94:07.23]Excellent comedy fodder.
[94:09.05]Yeah.
[94:09.69]We're on number six.
[94:10.23]Okay.
[94:11.17]But thank you, Gummy Monk.
[94:12.29]I want more secrets.
[94:14.55]I do want more secrets.
[94:15.49]We need to figure out the other secret.
[94:17.57]Like, what the heck?
[94:18.05]This is a very Super Mario platform.
[94:22.37]Yeah, it is.
[94:23.73]Don't jump.
[94:24.63]Oh, God.
[94:26.83]Okay, so you just can't.
[94:28.82]Why are we doing that?
[94:30.40]Why are we waiting?
[94:30.96]You don't have to wait on it.
[94:31.74]Why are we sitting there waiting on the damn thing?
[94:33.70]And there's a springy spring.
[94:34.76]Okay, alright.
[94:36.62]You get a double jump.
[94:38.82]Don't kill me.
[94:47.36]You just gotta let yourself double jump through there, but that's... That's kind of a tough double jump.
[94:52.04]It is a tough double jump.
[94:54.12]And it's only the first... What?
[94:56.83]How did I die?
[94:57.91]Oh, that's a tough double.
[94:59.65]Wendy's Mc-double-bick-buck-buck-bick-fuck-double.
[95:01.78]Remember that one from that bloody Trapland video?
[95:06.70]Let's bring back some nostalgia.
[95:08.16]How?
[95:09.66]They even have it drawn out in chalk that you're supposed to double jump.
[95:13.54]What the hell?
[95:14.30]That's how easy this double jump is supposed to be.
[95:16.58]Spore waiting room.
[95:19.69]We're not going to play fucking Spore until like Tuesday.
[95:21.45]Are we doing Power Rangers jokes in the chat now?
[95:25.51]We're doing, like, Power Ranger memes?
[95:27.45]Are we?
[95:27.73]Alright, I'm gonna let you go first.
[95:29.17]That's the waiting room one with the ResidentSleeper.
[95:32.01]Those good old days.
[95:33.85]Okay, that was just... Talc, you didn't even try.
[95:35.77]I didn't even try on that one.
[95:39.80]We're gonna be here for a while.
[95:42.74]Especially if we keep doing that to each other.
[95:45.94]Especially if we keep doing that.
[95:47.36]Oh, okay.
[95:49.72]I'll never do that again.
[95:51.17]So I can't fuck up the rest of this.
[95:53.86]Oh, what is, what?
[95:54.48]A and X?
[95:55.70]What does this, what do you mean AX?
[95:58.38]Why did we want to do that?
[96:00.24]Oh, that's the like, the belly flop.
[96:02.50]Why is it teaching us how to do that?
[96:04.74]I don't know.
[96:05.18]Don't we, shouldn't we already know that?
[96:06.40]We should have learned that a long time ago.
[96:08.14]Oh dear.
[96:10.81]Oh wait, it's just gotta be the lightest double jump.
[96:12.71]That's what the problem is.
[96:15.35]Do you see this and like, what's the deal with this one?
[96:18.09]Oh, come on.
[96:21.11]I just was trying to get a look at the level and... You gotta wait.
[96:24.53]You can't just go gung-ho.
[96:27.97]You go first every time.
[96:30.62]What are you doing?
[96:31.74]Why are you still sitting there?
[96:33.34]Why are you still sitting there?
[96:34.92]You had three opportunities to go.
[96:37.60]See, your sacrifice made it where I could get through that for the first time.
[96:41.92]It's okay.
[96:43.73]It was worth it.
[96:44.29]10 out of 10 would kill you again.
[96:47.49]Good luck.
[96:48.25]This next part is very confusing.
[96:50.80]It's a very confusing part.
[96:53.50]I'm never going to get through there again.
[96:58.94]You might as well.
[96:59.34]You're going to have to beat the whole level, dude.
[97:00.46]I'm never going to get there.
[97:01.18]What do you do from here?
[97:02.01]Oh, you have to go left.
[97:03.65]And wall jump?
[97:05.23]Oh, my God.
[97:06.87]Oh, boy.
[97:07.45]Okay.
[97:09.77]Jerma Craft waiting room.
[97:13.59]One of these days... Jerma Craft?
[97:15.16]Ugh.
[97:16.87]One of these days, we have to play Minecraft.
[97:18.68]I'm just going to turn the stream on, and me and Italic are going to be in Minecraft.
[97:22.18]Oh, boy.
[97:22.74]It's just classic vanilla Minecraft.
[97:26.69]I don't even know how to feel about that.
[97:30.06]And, by the way, I was not kidding, Etalyx.
[97:32.52]You have to beat this level, because I will never go through this again.
[97:35.58]Okay, look.
[97:36.22]I'll give you the pro strats.
[97:37.40]When you go off of the bumper, the baby bumper car, you want to go over like you normally would, but just lightly tap A. You just want to, like, you don't want to hold it down.
[97:45.11]If you hold it down, you die.
[97:46.57]You got to just tap it.
[97:47.45]Etalyx, just beat the goddamn level.
[97:53.50]Working on it.
[97:54.16]I'm so angry right now.
[97:58.63]Okay, I gotta just bounce here for a minute while I figure this out.
[98:01.79]You have to beat this before I seriously tear my eyeballs out.
[98:08.21]God.
[98:08.61]Oh.
[98:13.48]Oh.
[98:14.44]Okay, hang on.
[98:15.32]I might be able to make it easier for you.
[98:16.44]There.
[98:16.82]I just made it way easier.
[98:18.58]No, you just put it back down.
[98:20.14]Well.
[98:20.56]Thank you.
[98:21.08]Thank you for giving me the.
[98:21.92]You're welcome.
[98:22.76]Thank you for giving me the, like, the crutch.
[98:24.18]Teamwork.
[98:32.40]Okay, this being here is screwing me up.
[98:35.30]You know what?
[98:35.96]I think I'm gonna give you one more chance.
[98:38.42]I don't understand.
[98:38.92]I don't get it.
[98:40.53]Just go.
[98:42.01]I don't understand why that's not working.
[98:43.81]I'm getting increasingly frustrated.
[98:46.39]Okay, so you can't push the glide as soon as you jump.
[98:50.07]It has to be, like, one heartbeat later.
[98:53.52]So that's a unit of measurement.
[98:54.60]One heartbeat.
[98:55.02]I'm so glad you just did that.
[99:01.27]Or do more Dark Souls.
[99:02.97]I would love to do more Dark Souls if there was more in the game.
[99:05.82]I beat the game How was that by the way?
[99:09.56]Second DLC.
[99:11.06]Yeah, was it better than the first one?
[99:15.33]I'm gonna give it like I'm gonna give it to what would you rape?
[99:19.21]Okay, well with the first one get the same number the first one gets a second one gets a
[99:26.42]But, like, neither live up to the first game?
[99:29.26]Or, like, the base game?
[99:29.88]Let's say Bloodborne's DLC.
[99:31.96]Woven!
[99:33.20]Here we go!
[99:34.08]But, like, Dark Souls DLC?
[99:41.03]Oh, I thought you had, like, a wall jump off the thing.
[99:47.89]Hey, you better go!
[99:48.95]Hey, you better go!
[99:55.06]God damn it.
[99:56.78]You have to jump and then fall.
[100:06.77]I knew that was going to happen eventually.
[100:09.49]Hey, there's a secret coin up at the top left.
[100:11.79]I see.
[100:13.61]This is going to be so... That is such a tiny jump.
[100:18.33]The smallest jump.
[100:20.19]Club Penguin.
[100:21.13]What?
[100:21.99]Yeah.
[100:23.78]Bloodborne was two DLCs in one.
[100:25.27]I keep seeing that comparison, but that doesn't mean that it wasn't better, Luke.
[100:29.96]The Bloodborne DLC areas are so, so, so much better.
[100:35.73]And I never even played them.
[100:37.41]How sad.
[100:37.87]The research facility in Bloodborne is... You want to hold that... Alright, hold on a second.
[100:43.03]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[100:44.05]You want to hold the research facility DLC area in Bloodborne... Not the research facility.
[100:49.32]...to Swamp No.
[100:51.02]6 in Dark Souls 3's DLC.
[100:53.58]Really?
[100:53.80]Yeah.
[100:55.32]We're talking fucking shitty swamps number six.
[100:57.84]Not the research facility.
[100:58.74]You can't compare those.
[101:00.32]Un... I don't think so.
[101:01.78]I ain't gonna let you make that comparison.
[101:04.23]Come on.
[101:08.69]How expensive are the DLCs?
[101:11.19]Oh, they're not too bad.
[101:15.25]How do we get up to the top left?
[101:16.58]Fishing Hamlet.
[101:17.18]Yeah, Fishing Hamlet was fucking awesome too.
[101:18.90]Like, come on.
[101:20.88]And I'll kill Etalyx in this process.
[101:27.04]Hey, research facility was rehashed?
[101:29.03]I don't care.
[101:29.53]It's not swamp number seven.
[101:35.17]It's not swamp seven and Catacombs of Carthus.
[101:38.70]Catacombs of Carthus four.
[101:40.44]I figured it out.
[101:41.72]Finally figured it out.
[101:43.48]What do you mean?
[101:44.88]I know what to do.
[101:45.54]I just can't do it.
[101:46.62]Oh, God.
[101:47.63]I freaked out.
[101:56.05]And, like, Orphan... Orphan... The Orphan boss fight was... Sorry.
[102:00.24]It just... I'm so sorry.
[102:03.04]Orphan Akasha was so much fun.
[102:05.12]That boss fight was really cool.
[102:06.64]Lady Maria was really cool.
[102:10.95]Ludwig?
[102:13.45]Like, honest to God, you guys are gonna compare... You're gonna compare Ludwig...
[102:17.84]Not Ludwig.
[102:19.21]Yeah, I won't let you compare the Ludwig boss fight to anything that's in the Dark Souls 3 DLC.
[102:23.41]Anything.
[102:24.25]I won't allow it.
[102:25.01]In fact, if anyone does, you're gone.
[102:26.83]Permanently banned from this channel.
[102:30.21]What do I do now?
[102:30.84]Uh, I don't know.
[102:33.02]Do you see where I am?
[102:34.94]Ludwig is the coolest fight they've ever done in a sort of... Look what you've done, Chad.
[102:40.64]He cannot be swayed now.
[102:42.11]Look what you've done.
[102:44.04]The Ludwig boss battle is the coolest boss fight I think they've ever done in a Souls game.
[102:50.23]That shit was so cool.
[102:55.89]And now I can't even play the game because I'm talking about Ludwig.
[102:59.68]I think I could win, but I want to get the coin.
[103:03.78]How do you get over this thing of spikes over here?
[103:07.97]Okay, I made it over here.
[103:08.85]Alright, you have to wall jump.
[103:10.41]Look, you have to just wall jump, wall jump.
[103:12.25]Oh my god, I didn't even see that.
[103:13.83]I didn't even see that shit.
[103:18.13]I played Dark Souls 1, I just never beat it.
[103:24.84]Master Hand, and I didn't even... There's no way to make this jump.
[103:31.00]The boss in Bloody Traplet 2 is cooler than Ludwig.
[103:33.60]No way.
[103:34.66]I refuse to hear that.
[103:36.70]Not a chance.
[103:41.72]What are you going for here?
[103:43.00]Trying to go for the coin.
[103:43.82]There's no way to go for the coin if you do it that way.
[103:45.74]Fucking forgot those spikes on the left existed again.
[103:52.28]How long have we been in it on this level, huh?
[103:57.90]Easy level, guys.
[103:59.37]Just a stupid, easy desert.
[104:01.09]No big deal.
[104:04.67]Okay, I'm paying attention now.
[104:06.87]Me too.
[104:07.57]Starting now.
[104:08.22]This is a bloody Trapland stream, not a Dark Souls 3 stream.
[104:20.04]We should be talking about bloody Trapland.
[104:21.78]Yeah.
[104:23.58]I swear to God.
[104:25.91]Like, seriously.
[104:26.81]You go first.
[104:30.17]I'm just concentrating.
[104:31.11]I'm thinking really hard right now.
[104:36.86]I'm gonna wait for you.
[104:37.70]About how to get over... Wait for me!
[104:40.24]There's like 30 feet of distance between the two of you.
[104:42.74]You're fine.
[104:45.02]I am still.
[104:45.86]It's scary.
[104:48.17]So, if you want the coin... Well, if you want to go up and win the game, you have to go up.
[104:52.89]But I think to get the coin, you have to go across this to the left.
[104:55.57]Well, I'm gonna... Okay.
[104:58.46]So... Can't make that... There's a way to, like, climb the rocks.
[105:02.36]I think you have to jump on the rocks, yeah.
[105:06.29]Like, you gotta jump... Oh, boy, this is gonna be tough.
[105:10.42]Oh!
[105:10.62]Yeah.
[105:11.62]Ooh.
[105:13.98]Ah, it was a good landing.
[105:17.92]Oh, that's gonna be hard.
[105:19.78]You gotta hit that perfectly.
[105:22.05]I'm floundering right now.
[105:24.31]Alright, let's... Come back to it.
[105:25.59]Come back to it.
[105:26.43]We gotta move on.
[105:27.15]Come back to it.
[105:28.09]We're gonna be stuck here all night.
[105:29.37]Okay, well, I can't even get past the, like, the default obstacles at the bottom.
[105:33.89]I'm just trying to rush it now.
[105:37.57]I'm just trying to go as fast as I can.
[105:38.71]I shouldn't be going as fast as I can.
[105:39.81]I need to calm down.
[105:45.90]Okay.
[105:48.28]Yeah, let's go.
[105:49.16]Come back.
[105:49.68]Oh, there's a platform there.
[105:54.69]Like a homing missile.
[105:56.11]Where do you go from here?
[105:58.49]You're supposed to... You're not supposed to go back there.
[106:01.13]Wait, what?
[106:01.39]What do you mean not supposed to go back here?
[106:06.08]You gotta go left and up again, dude.
[106:07.84]You're like... What?
[106:09.96]Hold on.
[106:10.72]Oh, God!
[106:11.88]Oh, my.
[106:12.56]It's getting worse.
[106:14.22]It's just getting progressively worse.
[106:16.28]Oh, God.
[106:17.64]Oh.
[106:19.98]Please!
[106:23.27]Okay.
[106:23.89]Please!
[106:24.43]Okay.
[106:25.65]Somebody!
[106:27.93]Kirby Puzzle Room?
[106:29.27]I got it now.
[106:30.13]Okay.
[106:31.11]You just do it, Dad.
[106:32.53]You do it, Dad.
[106:42.65]You get like you get like drugged when you play this game my I can't see this when I thought I was joking when I told you earlier, but that I Am on drugs right now
[106:56.98]Like, I wouldn't be surprised.
[106:58.40]If I, like, went to the doctor, and he stuck, like, a needle in me, he was like, let me just check to see your drug levels.
[107:03.18]Alright, you got, oh, wow, you're full of drugs.
[107:05.42]That's what he would say.
[107:06.56]And I'd be like, I know.
[107:08.44]What have you been doing?
[107:10.84]I've been playing this fucking bloody Trapland game.
[107:13.06]It just makes you, like, on drugs.
[107:15.61]You better stop doing that, son.
[107:18.67]What happened?
[107:19.77]You're welcome.
[107:20.85]What'd you do?
[107:21.83]I won.
[107:23.05]We didn't get the coin, but I beat the level.
[107:24.97]I didn't even see you do that.
[107:29.19]Too fast, too quick.
[107:30.89]78% drug level.
[107:35.30]God, there's not even like a secret in there either.
[107:37.54]No, there's a secret in this one though.
[107:39.26]Is there?
[107:40.87]No, the next one there is.
[107:42.79]I think it's that one.
[107:44.95]But what's that like little silhouette?
[107:47.93]This one is huge.
[107:48.35]Kind of behind it.
[107:49.65]Watch out for the hot zone.
[107:54.41]Okay.
[107:55.47]It doesn't seem that dangerous.
[107:56.99]Yeah, it does.
[107:58.85]It's hot.
[108:01.10]You can't be in the sun for too long.
[108:07.92]Oh, there's spikes.
[108:08.88]Okay.
[108:10.38]Oh, you just took a shortcut.
[108:11.92]Yeah, but you burned death.
[108:20.57]I knew that was coming, but I went anyway.
[108:22.85]Okay, so this is... Ah!
[108:28.20]Yeah, the spikes, exactly.
[108:33.34]Stream Battlegrounds like 90% of Twitch?
[108:37.77]No, I don't want to stream.
[108:38.95]You know what?
[108:39.29]Let's talk about Battlegrounds.
[108:40.57]You guys ready?
[108:41.23]Oh, let's talk about Battlegrounds.
[108:42.67]You guys ready to talk about Battlegrounds?
[108:44.15]I'm ready to talk about Battlegrounds.
[108:45.73]Oh, boy.
[108:46.89]So let's go over this.
[108:47.65]Uh-huh.
[108:49.59]H1Z1 comes out.
[108:51.08]Yeah, like two years ago or whatever.
[108:53.50]Two fucking years ago, H1Z1 comes out.
[108:55.84]At least a year and a half.
[108:56.74]I can't remember how old is H1Z1 at this point.
[108:58.32]Made by this guy, right?
[109:00.76]Didn't this same guy make, like, wasn't he, like, brought onto the H1Z1 Battle Royale?
[109:04.60]I thought that he was, like, a... Okay, it kind of goes back before H1Z1, though, right?
[109:10.91]Arma had a game mode that people liked...
[109:15.22]And H1Z1 kind of took it, co-opted it, and made it like a full featured pay-in, buy-in type of get rewards and loot thing, right?
[109:25.53]So Battle Royale was originally on Arma.
[109:28.47]And the Arma guy was making his own called Battlegrounds, I guess.
[109:34.57]So, H1Z1, like, popularized it more because everyone on Twitch was playing it, and now it's, who cares about H1Z1?
[109:43.32]They, like, ran the whole company into the ground.
[109:45.12]Sony Games is, like, sold.
[109:46.64]But didn't this guy work on H1Z1?
[109:49.47]He worked on the Arma one.
[109:51.53]He worked on the Arma Battlegrounds mod.
[109:53.65]Battle Royale or whatever it's called.
[109:56.77]So he was Arma.
[109:57.67]He was like a modder, I'm pretty sure.
[109:59.25]But wait, this guy wasn't on the dev team for H1Z1's Battle Royale.
[110:02.82]I think they used him as a... I love how we're just two little furry animals standing here.
[110:09.18]I think they used him as a... What do you call it when you contract somebody to give you counsel and advice?
[110:18.29]He was an advisor or whatever.
[110:20.73]I'm pretty sure they used his opinion.
[110:22.67]I don't think that he coded it.
[110:25.67]I think he helped.
[110:26.97]But it's just another H1Z1 Battle Royale game.
[110:30.82]It is another H1Z1 Battle Royale thing.
[110:33.46]But it's like the original one.
[110:35.20]But it's by the original guy.
[110:37.32]Basically, H1Z1 was making a ton of money.
[110:41.85]Yeah, what Scorpion's saying.
[110:43.17]And so he made his own game so that he could make money on it.
[110:46.35]And his is way better than H1Z1, right?
[110:47.93]His is apparently better than H1Z1.
[110:49.91]Okay, so that's so complicated.
[110:54.01]So H1Z1 just never needed to exist, essentially.
[110:58.21]We're just standing here discussing.
[111:00.00]Nice podcast.
[111:01.48]Exactly.
[111:02.22]We're just two little furries standing here wagging our tails.
[111:04.64]We're just two kitty cats.
[111:08.38]I get it.
[111:09.08]We needed to talk about it because I didn't know.
[111:12.44]No, I was clearly first.
[111:13.42]No.
[111:13.50]That's not what happened.
[111:14.39]I just wanna see what's over here, you know?
[111:34.09]Well, beat it.
[111:34.90]I'm not doing that.
[111:35.46]Hang on, I'm on fire.
[111:36.28]Just give me a sec.
[111:37.88]Battlegrounds is great.
[111:38.80]I keep hearing great things, but I was under the assumption that...
[111:45.34]Consultant.
[111:45.84]That's the word.
[111:47.50]I was under the impression that it was another one.
[111:49.98]It was like the same kind of thing.
[111:51.59]But just different.
[111:52.35]And it was like better.
[111:53.17]But it wasn't the same.
[111:54.15]But it's the same game.
[111:54.89]But it's not the same game.
[111:55.67]It's a different guy.
[111:56.49]Same guy.
[111:57.65]So, like, I got really confused.
[111:59.15]That's what I wanted to talk about.
[112:00.59]It's just a big money maker because it's one of those round-based games that you can... Why did I go?
[112:06.87]Why did I just go?
[112:08.05]I don't know.
[112:08.53]Neither do I. I gotta slide.
[112:13.96]Alright, so...
[112:16.20]That's cool, though.
[112:17.06]Alright, whatever.
[112:18.28]Apparently, it's a pretty good game.
[112:20.37]Okay, here's honestly the thing that makes it better.
[112:23.37]I haven't played it myself.
[112:26.06]And I don't know if they ever had this in h1z1 But the thing that keeps everybody playing it right now, especially on Twitch is it supports teams really so you can go in with a friend and Like see where they are at all times with a waypoint Okay And after you die you will spectate them so you can still like talk to them in comms and make call outs for people that They can see so I think that's why it's got such a huge following because you can play like twos threes fours big groups
[112:53.80]H1Z1 was always solo.
[112:55.54]They may have had a team mode, but when I played it, it was always solo.
[113:00.33]And then, like, Sony got rid of Daybreak, and Daybreak became its own thing.
[113:03.39]No, Sony got... Sony Online, like, the whole SOE got sold.
[113:08.03]Sold?
[113:08.23]To somebody else.
[113:09.43]Yeah, SOE got sold as a whole.
[113:11.62]That's why they, like, canceled all their games.
[113:14.66]Like, uh, remember MMO?
[113:17.54]What's it called?
[113:18.68]EverQuest?
[113:19.65]Next?
[113:19.83]So what you're saying is to make a successful video game, you need to make a guy with backpack gets flown into an area that has grass and some buildings.
[113:29.89]And then guy with backpack picks up, like, cloth and random weapons.
[113:33.51]No, you don't craft.
[113:34.67]You just find weapons, and people just like finding loot.
[113:37.50]And you find, like, cans of beans, and you shoot the other guys that are in third person.
[113:41.58]Yeah.
[113:42.30]Uh-huh.
[113:43.18]But you have to fly in on like a parachute, right?
[113:45.84]Yes.
[113:46.12]You have to be dropped in on like a parachute.
[113:48.32]Yeah.
[113:48.72]Because when you get dropped in, you get to like... Cool.
[113:51.64]Everyone gets to talk in the airplane and make racist jokes.
[113:54.80]Yeah, I can't wait.
[113:56.50]Can't wait for that fucking awful shit.
[114:00.32]I wouldn't be opposed to, like, trying it out, but I haven't gotten the urge to install it yet.
[114:06.19]I can't wait to have everybody scream, like, awful swears at me.
[114:09.11]By the way, what is with that?
[114:10.45]What is with the fucking awful swear shit?
[114:12.18]Like, what is going on there?
[114:13.60]Can we, like, cut that shit out as a community?
[114:16.16]Like, as a fucking community?
[114:19.22]What are you talking about?
[114:20.50]Talk about people being mean to each other in fucking game chats.
[114:22.93]Like, can we just be, like, a good community?
[114:28.33]Okay.
[114:29.01]We actually have to beat this now.
[114:30.37]We actually do have to beat this.
[114:32.41]I'm actually starting to freak the fuck out.
[114:36.27]Oh my fucking god.
[114:40.10]Why?
[114:40.30]I'm not even in the sunlight.
[114:45.50]Where's the Dr. Pepper, Jerma?
[115:02.09]One second, sorry.
[115:09.20]Shh.
[115:09.64]Nobody tell him.
[115:10.26]Nobody tell him.
[115:15.40]Alright.
[115:18.22]Let's go.
[115:19.65]Did you win?
[115:22.23]Huh?
[115:22.55]Did you win?
[115:23.25]You won, right?
[115:24.65]Not yet.
[115:27.52]Oh god, there you are.
[115:28.52]Please.
[115:29.56]Don't die.
[115:29.98]Don't die.
[115:30.32]Don't die.
[115:30.60]We gotta get out of here.
[115:31.69]I was hiding.
[115:32.51]I wanted to see if you could find me.
[115:33.77]I saw you peek your head up.
[115:35.35]How did you get there?
[115:37.73]Uh... I just got so excited I can't even beat the level.
[115:40.57]Not that way.
[115:43.37]Alright, here's what you do.
[115:44.43]Stop.
[115:45.77]No, I'm gonna die!
[115:46.35]I'm gonna burn!
[115:47.35]Don't tell me to stop!
[115:48.65]You're like, stop!
[115:49.29]Not in the sunlight!
[115:51.30]That's not what you indicated.
[115:53.40]Stop in the shade up at the top by the cactus.
[115:56.00]Is that more specific for you?
[115:57.36]Thank you, thank you.
[115:58.22]There.
[115:59.02]Wall jump left to right to right again.
[116:02.42]No, that's not left.
[116:04.38]You said right!
[116:05.54]I said left to right to right again.
[116:10.54]Okay, we're gonna need some not-as-wimpy wall jumps, please.
[116:13.66]Just please beat the level code, please.
[116:16.20]Please don't die.
[116:17.24]That thing just sped up, by the way.
[116:20.37]Oh god, why did you go so fast?
[116:21.93]That's gonna hit you.
[116:22.63]It's gonna hit you.
[116:29.34]Leave it to me!
[116:30.52]Thank god.
[116:31.26]I'll take care of business.
[116:39.77]There's a whole other part.
[116:41.27]What is there?
[116:41.79]There's more of the level?
[116:44.48]Was there a secret here?
[116:45.94]There was a big silhouette there.
[116:47.88]Maybe it's not done.
[116:48.32]Like, on that level.
[116:50.66]Maybe that shit ain't done yet.
[116:52.26]I don't know.
[116:53.12]Well, we can go to nine and, like, unlock the pyramid.
[116:58.70]This looks, uh, this looks overly complicated.
[117:01.16]There's just a lot of moving pieces.
[117:03.66]It looks like a few different ways to go here.
[117:06.43]This is open world.
[117:07.33]The first open world bloody trampoline.
[117:11.37]That was easy.
[117:12.21]So was that.
[117:14.17]So was that.
[117:15.99]Watch out for the spikes.
[117:18.81]Okay.
[117:19.43]Oh, god.
[117:20.31]Look at this.
[117:20.93]This is going to be annoying.
[117:22.95]And I tried to wall jump and I couldn't get it to work.
[117:27.75]So I guess the other big thing about Bloody Trapland 2 is they have like a level editor.
[117:33.36]So if people actually start playing this game, then they can make their own levels.
[117:37.26]Like Super Mario Maker.
[117:38.58]Alright, you go first because I don't know what to do here.
[117:44.07]Just AFK and read chat while Etalyx beats the game.
[117:46.43]Your turn.
[117:48.13]Your turn.
[117:51.27]Ah, what?
[117:54.49]What do you do next?
[117:56.67]What's the point?
[117:57.21]Oh, can I land on that platform?
[118:00.23]We'll never know.
[118:00.77]God.
[118:04.09]My game just lagged right there.
[118:05.18]That was weird.
[118:08.98]What other rants can we go on?
[118:10.22]What do you think?
[118:11.58]Um...
[118:14.35]Like video game related?
[118:17.65]I got up here.
[118:18.35]So how the hell do you do this?
[118:19.17]You have to slide?
[118:19.89]I think you just have to slide down it.
[118:24.92]No, I... I mean, close.
[118:28.48]You got it.
[118:28.92]Yeah, you did.
[118:29.98]How did I not die?
[118:30.66]Why am I not dying to this?
[118:33.26]Okay.
[118:36.36]Okay, the actual tough part is in the middle.
[118:50.89]Shit in my fucking pants.
[118:53.93]Right in my pants.
[118:55.25]Like honestly, just fill my pants with a dump and leave it there.
[118:58.81]Okay, seriously though.
[118:59.67]Three days or something.
[119:01.43]Or something.
[119:02.75]I'm not even ready to make punchlines, guys.
[119:04.61]Or something.
[119:05.07]I don't know.
[119:05.73]I'm gonna make a joke or something.
[119:06.87]Who cares?
[119:09.79]Alright, you want something dumb to rant about?
[119:11.57]I got it.
[119:11.85]Hold on, before you bring anything up.
[119:16.20]Let me look at this for a second.
[119:17.64]I'm supposed to be looking at this.
[119:19.74]What killed me?
[119:21.18]I didn't stand up.
[119:24.02]If you... You can't go all the way under the middle platform.
[119:26.90]You have to wall jump over the top and land on the moving concrete platform.
[119:31.51]Fucking god.
[119:33.15]So, we have officially entered, like,
[119:37.12]Oh, I made it.
[119:37.66]And then I missed.
[119:38.22]And then I missed.
[119:38.88]Wait, what do I do?
[119:40.38]Wall jump right?
[119:41.12]Left?
[119:42.04]Land on the platform?
[119:42.66]Huh?
[119:42.96]Huh?
[119:43.60]Huh?
[119:43.96]Land on the platform?
[119:44.62]What do I do?
[119:45.90]Uh, go left?
[119:46.38]Oh, no!
[119:47.22]Oh, no!
[119:48.06]Okay, I got it.
[119:48.69]No, I got it.
[119:55.29]God damn it.
[119:58.73]I should have just waited and watched.
[120:00.23]Alright, give me the dumb thing to rant about so you can, like, beat the game for me.
[120:05.19]Uh, I saw just yesterday that, uh... I think... This... Hang on.
[120:12.27]Boop!
[120:13.07]Seriously... Alright, I'm gonna sit right here.
[120:14.43]Flying fuck.
[120:16.11]That is so annoying.
[120:18.51]That, like, quarter of a pixel that you get hit... Is seriously... That's so... Not fair!
[120:27.03]It's not fair!
[120:28.17]I made it.
[120:29.57]I'm gonna make this.
[120:30.29]Don't complete the level without me.
[120:33.92]It's not fair!
[120:34.86]It's like quarter pixel bullshit.
[120:35.52]You were just, uh, curb your enthusiasm.
[120:36.36]And you know, and I fucked it up, and be, like, uh... Like, it's just, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's
[120:58.62]You have to just like, you know how you play these games?
[121:02.20]Uh, over and over again until you win?
[121:03.62]No, you have to sit silent in a room.
[121:06.44]And just, that's all you do.
[121:08.20]You don't even fucking say any words.
[121:09.74]That's how you play these games.
[121:14.77]Alright, I'm going first.
[121:23.15]Your little splatter made me fall.
[121:25.47]I blame you for that.
[121:27.81]Yep.
[121:29.75]Mm-hmm.
[121:30.69]Oh my god.
[121:34.28]It's not even... It is faceplant.
[121:36.12]It is very first spike.
[121:37.52]It's not even like... It's not even hard.
[121:40.20]It's just irritating.
[121:42.04]It's not even hard.
[121:54.44]I'm going to break this controller in half.
[121:57.02]Wait.
[122:03.09]I made it again.
[122:03.81]Now I don't know what to do after this.
[122:05.99]I think... that I have to wall jump up, slide out... Where's the exit?
[122:11.07]It's gotta be at the very top.
[122:12.35]Why did I just do that?
[122:13.29]What the fuck am I doing?
[122:17.72]You gotta... Are you doing the die?
[122:21.80]Yes!
[122:22.20]I'm doing it, but it's like not... Just fucking memorizing entire levels!
[122:35.62]Oh, my God, Etalyx!
[122:39.44]I really don't know what... You haven't even gotten to the frustrating part yet.
[122:43.92]I'm just on complete tilted.
[122:45.46]I can't do it.
[122:49.18]That, like, that little... That jump into the dash thing...
[122:53.84]Like seriously, fuck off.
[122:56.82]That shit is so annoying.
[122:58.42]It's so fucking annoying.
[123:00.48]It's so annoying.
[123:03.84]If you press the dash button, just let me fucking do the upload.
[123:06.87]Just let it happen.
[123:08.09]Why does it have to be at a very specific fucking time in history?
[123:13.51]Why does it have to be like that?
[123:14.95]And I didn't even do it.
[123:19.88]You did not.
[123:20.48]You'd have to wait until it goes down.
[123:21.34]I love how this is...
[123:22.70]We've been doing this since the second level.
[123:26.08]But it's just like, it gets, that's so specific.
[123:29.04]It's a specific, you have to press it the exact fucking time.
[123:31.44]Push, push, push, push.
[123:32.68]It's like that.
[123:33.32]Push, push.
[123:35.45]Ah, it didn't work.
[123:36.83]Didn't... I'm about to rage quit this game.
[123:41.65]Just because of that issue.
[123:43.13]Just because of the stupid dash thing.
[123:44.73]Where it has to be pressed at a specific... Oh, boy.
[123:48.34]Okay.
[123:52.86]I gotta win.
[123:53.72]You put a goddamn dash in the game.
[123:55.26]Okay, you're freaking- you're making me mess it up now.
[124:00.74]You forgot to duck.
[124:03.02]You forgot to duck.
[124:03.90]You put a goddamn dash in the game and the dash don't even work unless you press it in one pixel.
[124:14.97]That'll be out of early access in a week.
[124:19.77]Mark my fucking words.
[124:23.43]That shit'll be out of... What just happened right there?
[124:25.95]That shit's out of early access next Monday.
[124:30.36]It's gonna be like, oh, sorry, we removed this stupid fucking dash.
[124:33.20]You have to be at a pixel-perfect thing to make it work.
[124:39.32]We are so sorry, Jeremy.
[124:40.92]I made it.
[124:42.32]I made it.
[124:44.06]I just don't know what to do next.
[124:45.60]Mr. Harrington, we are so sorry about this.
[124:47.84]We'll never do it again.
[124:49.10]They're gonna write like a formal apology.
[124:52.32]Like a hand sign.
[124:53.45]Like an egomaniac I would have to be.
[124:59.68]Just please get us out of here.
[125:01.53]I don't know what to do from this point.
[125:03.15]Let me look.
[125:03.65]Let me see.
[125:04.89]How do you go up left?
[125:06.15]There's spikes blocking that path.
[125:09.11]You have to go out through the tube.
[125:11.11]You have to dash out and then jump to the left.
[125:14.06]So when you see that little, you dash and then when you're falling, jump up to the left.
[125:17.88]And then wall jump.
[125:18.88]Okay.
[125:25.45]Angry sweaty streamer.
[125:33.36]Alright, calm is done.
[125:35.54]I almost just died again.
[125:42.56]God, that fucking dash.
[125:46.24]You'll make it one of these times.
[125:48.76]It's so specific.
[125:52.12]When you need to be worrying about so many things, I don't want to have to worry about a pixel perfect in-air dash.
[125:57.77]Really?
[125:58.07]Alright, I'm making it consistently now.
[126:05.49]That just made me so mad.
[126:07.81]That angered me more than the spikes.
[126:09.05]I'm angry with you.
[126:10.37]I'm actually angry at you right now.
[126:12.57]My, like, mouth just, like, curled down.
[126:14.25]I was just like, motherfucker.
[126:16.36]How dare he?
[126:17.20]I'm just imagining it, like, quiver.
[126:19.34]Your lip just quivers and your eyebrow twitches.
[126:23.18]I can't.
[126:23.96]I, like... It's not even hard.
[126:29.00]Oh, my God.
[126:38.78]I made it past the easy part and still screwed it up.
[126:42.66]I keep dying here because I'm so sick of doing this over and over again.
[126:47.04]I've gotten to a point where I'm sick and fucking tired of doing this.
[126:49.50]That I'm dying to the wicked easy shit right now.
[126:51.68]I did it again.
[126:52.40]I'm talking about it and I did it again.
[126:55.04]I'm sitting here complaining about it.
[127:00.32]Look, why don't you just watch me play?
[127:02.70]Don't die to that.
[127:06.74]No.
[127:07.64]It's this part that I died to.
[127:09.00]I'm just going to shut the fuck up and let you beat this.
[127:27.23]I can feel it.
[127:28.15]I can taste it.
[127:29.43]It's on the cusp.
[127:29.93]Okay.
[127:37.33]What just happened?
[127:38.25]The game just fucked up on me.
[127:41.45]What?
[127:42.05]I have no idea.
[127:42.93]I'm going to take that.
[127:43.67]Just be cool.
[127:44.08]I'm going to take it.
[127:44.74]I'm just going to take it.
[127:46.66]Just be cool.
[127:49.22]I didn't wall jump.
[127:50.84]It didn't wall jump.
[127:52.68]I hate this game.
[127:56.10]I hate this game.
[127:57.68]I loathe it.
[127:59.40]I just wanted to wall jump.
[128:04.98]Oh, God.
[128:05.54]I, like, slid back in.
[128:09.04]It was the only way to go.
[128:10.22]Why, God?
[128:17.98]Oh, my God.
[128:24.33]What are you doing?
[128:25.91]What have you done?
[128:26.67]I panicked.
[128:27.45]I panicked.
[128:28.77]Ugh.
[128:35.09]My sweaty hands just... My hands are so sweaty.
[128:40.16]They are just drenched.
[128:48.62]Uh-oh.
[128:55.48]I got stuck on this stupid pillar.
[128:57.78]I don't understand.
[128:59.85]How are you actually supposed to do that over there?
[129:05.24]You know what I mean?
[129:06.08]That is an extremely difficult jump to do.
[129:08.28]See?
[129:13.96]It's happening to you now.
[129:14.59]It's not just happening to me.
[129:15.93]See?
[129:17.83]See, right now, I heard that noise.
[129:19.55]That's a noise I know very well.
[129:21.79]That's a I'm angry noise.
[129:31.56]Let's make sure we're doing that right, by the way.
[129:33.72]Okay.
[129:34.22]Okay.
[129:35.28]I can't stop holding my breath.
[129:36.60]You have to slide out and then jump to the left and then wall jump again.
[129:40.13]Right?
[129:40.57]And then wall jump again, yes.
[129:41.99]Are you just watching me?
[129:47.07]Is that even... Is that even physically fucking possible?
[129:51.63]I feel like that's not possible to do.
[129:52.87]It's gotta be.
[129:56.30]I guess it kind of has to be.
[129:59.44]I'm trying really hard not to jump on you right now.
[130:01.86]I'm...
[130:06.89]It's coming any second now.
[130:07.99]I can feel it.
[130:08.87]What, the controller going through my drywall?
[130:10.93]I can feel that too.
[130:12.42]One of two things.
[130:13.40]Either Jerma's just going to disappear from the game, or I'm going to hear something get thrown.
[130:19.80]I can't figure out which one's going to happen first.
[130:22.38]It's going to be one of those two.
[130:35.91]Your turn.
[130:37.81]I didn't even make the wall jump.
[130:39.03]Like, hold on a second.
[130:41.17]What is the little... How did I just walk on that?
[130:45.99]Do you see that on the right?
[130:48.08]That, like, little thing?
[130:50.76]Like, where that little slot is?
[130:52.22]Uh-huh.
[130:55.52]What did... What happened?
[131:00.70]Etalyx, what did you do?
[131:01.36]I didn't even see what you did.
[131:02.24]How did you completely... What did you do?
[131:03.42]I don't know.
[131:05.52]I don't understand what happened.
[131:09.42]You just walked right.
[131:10.94]You just walked to the fucking right.
[131:13.70]That's all you did.
[131:15.50]We didn't unlock anything.
[131:18.36]Nothing happened.
[131:23.45]Maybe there's no secret level there yet.
[131:25.01]Maybe it hasn't been made.
[131:25.99]Because that's got to be the secret.
[131:27.27]Because I walked right and the pyramids to the right.
[131:30.57]What?
[131:30.77]No, we have to do this again.
[131:34.06]Well, yeah, but it's not like it's any harder than it was when we were doing it two seconds ago.
[131:37.41]It's actually easier because it's cleaner looking.
[131:41.77]You just ruined it, Yoge.
[131:43.17]You just ruined it.
[131:45.09]He just ruined it.
[131:47.64]Oh, gosh.
[131:50.86]I hate that dash.
[131:54.06]I just want to dash when I press dash.
[131:57.59]If a dev is watching right now, I hate you.
[132:00.35]Just kidding.
[132:01.21]Just kidding.
[132:04.43]I hate you.
[132:07.40]If a developer is watching right now, God, I hate you.
[132:09.22]I forgot to slide.
[132:16.76]You're safe right here, right?
[132:19.75]How on Earth...
[132:26.26]I mean, you're not safe anywhere here.
[132:29.72]You have to do it like that.
[132:32.64]I didn't even touch it.
[132:34.54]I want a slow-mo rewind of me touching that, because it didn't happen.
[132:39.80]Oh, you probably panic jumped like me and hit the spikes above.
[132:42.77]No, no I didn't.
[132:45.35]They're fucking dev watching right now.
[132:49.11]Where's the dev?
[132:55.87]You definitely touched it.
[133:00.72]I know I did.
[133:01.38]I'm just trying to... I can't even talk right now.
[133:05.42]That's how hard I am trying.
[133:07.79]Let's just both shut the fuck up and beat this level.
[133:11.25]I'm not going to say another word until this level is done.
[133:15.17]Not a single, single sentence is going to come out of my mouth.
[133:17.76]Here we go.
[133:18.00]Okay.
[133:18.70]Okay.
[133:38.68]It makes it funny, just like this, the quiet.
[133:41.32]Okay, shh.
[133:47.18]Hang on, I've got a shot here.
[133:48.30]I'm gonna let you go first.
[133:51.04]The belly flop.
[133:53.33]Okay, just let me have this.
[134:04.07]Being quiet worked.
[134:05.39]It actually worked.
[134:09.05]Thank God.
[134:11.05]Thank God you're not a psycho like me.
[134:18.66]There's one more.
[134:19.76]I want to do that level.
[134:22.60]The secret one that looks like it's over to the right?
[134:25.90]This is another boss, by the way.
[134:29.78]That was terrifying.
[134:32.04]Okay.
[134:33.62]I think you have to eat the TNTs.
[134:42.87]Right?
[134:44.43]Uh, yeah?
[134:45.24]This spike's on those two.
[134:53.74]I guess we- do we- I don't even have a chance to- Hey, I got this, I got this, I got this.
[134:58.97]He's coming.
[134:59.35]Watch out, that's gonna blow you up.
[135:00.99]Oh, what?
[135:02.25]Yeah, dude, it's a TNT, it's a fucking bomb.
[135:04.31]Oh, I thought he had to eat it.
[135:05.85]I didn't know it just auto-armed it as soon as you touched it.
[135:08.30]Yeah, yeah, it turns it on.
[135:13.10]Stupid spikes.
[135:13.90]You didn't eat that one?
[135:17.70]This might actually take us a while.
[135:20.58]This might actually, yeah.
[135:22.87]So you're safe underneath.
[135:23.97]I can't get up there.
[135:32.57]There's no way you can even get up there.
[135:38.92]As long as you don't get hit by the teeth, I think you live.
[135:40.92]So you can walk on top of them, basically.
[135:44.06]Yeah, you can.
[135:45.51]You are right.
[135:46.57]Watch out for the spike on that one.
[135:47.61]It's weird.
[135:49.35]Eat that one?
[135:49.87]No?
[135:50.05]Oh, there we go.
[135:52.77]Okay.
[135:53.27]He got that one.
[135:53.75]Did you get a hit?
[135:56.79]Yeah.
[135:56.99]One hit.
[136:00.78]I would just say forget the ones that are too high to go up.
[136:02.84]What's the point of even trying to get them?
[136:04.38]Yeah, I can't.
[136:05.00]That one's got spikes on both ledges.
[136:06.62]He's going to hit this one, I think.
[136:10.14]Come on.
[136:10.94]What?
[136:11.56]Oh, that was kind of bullshit.
[136:17.02]Oh, no.
[136:17.50]So close.
[136:19.50]Almost.
[136:20.66]Almost.
[136:23.54]Almost.
[136:30.58]Need more TNT game.
[136:31.76]Come on.
[136:32.92]What if there was like a limited amount and if you used them all, you ran out and had to start over?
[136:36.64]That would be very, very sad.
[136:38.37]That would be extremely sad.
[136:39.97]Alright.
[136:40.57]Is he coming up here?
[136:41.27]Nope.
[136:44.75]Nice job.
[136:46.05]There we go.
[136:48.31]There's two.
[136:48.65]I'm assuming it's three.
[136:50.88]It's got to be three, right?
[136:51.54]Like every video game ever made.
[136:54.68]It's always three hits.
[136:55.94]It is always three.
[136:56.52]I don't know how he didn't need me, but okay.
[137:02.89]Again?
[137:03.37]What?
[137:06.15]I didn't get hit either.
[137:10.29]I am blue, if you're wondering.
[137:11.55]Be curious.
[137:18.24]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[137:20.50]Shit!
[137:21.30]What?
[137:22.90]Does he actually have to eat them?
[137:24.72]I think he has to go, like, directly underneath them, but, like, how do you even... Kind of just have to get, like, lucky...
[137:30.73]Unless there's something we're missing.
[137:31.69]Are we missing something important?
[137:32.71]There might be something we're missing, but... I don't see any more TNTs, Etalyx.
[137:38.05]There's one more.
[137:39.31]They're coming in, like Frogger style.
[137:41.75]Are they?
[137:42.41]Or is there just one more up there?
[137:46.57]I think there just might be one more.
[137:49.13]No way.
[137:49.61]Yeah, I think... Oh, no, thank goodness.
[137:53.11]Nope, there's one.
[137:56.69]There it is.
[137:58.21]We did it.
[137:58.55]We won.
[137:59.39]We won!
[138:03.03]That's kind of loud.
[138:05.45]What?
[138:08.45]Do I have to leave?
[138:11.46]Oh, yeah.
[138:16.02]Oh.
[138:16.52]Yeah, alright.
[138:17.08]Hey, we did it.
[138:18.78]I couldn't see that entrance on my screen for whatever reason.
[138:21.66]Did he have like a death animation on your screen?
[138:23.42]Because he just kind of didn't come back.
[138:25.21]Yeah, he kind of did like a... No, it was just blank on my screen.
[138:30.14]Oh, well.
[138:30.72]Okay.
[138:32.50]So that's probably it.
[138:34.66]That ain't it.
[138:36.05]Oh, really?
[138:36.95]Look at this.
[138:37.61]What is this shit?
[138:40.71]May not be able to access it yet.
[138:42.49]That's just like signs of things to come.
[138:46.58]Looks like Ice World.
[138:47.72]I want to go on Ice World.
[138:49.18]It's a candy world.
[138:50.84]What if you pull into the dock?
[138:52.74]I just tried.
[138:57.10]That is tried.
[138:58.14]I wanna, what, you don't have access to, we can't do Candyland yet?
[139:03.02]Don't think it's in the access, early access.
[139:05.54]Dev baited.
[139:06.20]Um, is there any more?
[139:09.58]Uh, just that secret room.
[139:11.93]Yeah.
[139:13.35]Which I don't, I think we would've gotten to if it was there.
[139:17.47]Mmm, let's see.
[139:18.63]Uh, cause I went through the secret exit.
[139:24.12]Anything above?
[139:26.00]Maybe there's this.
[139:28.20]Wait, hold on.
[139:30.64]There's Ice World.
[139:32.86]Hey, ladies and gentlemen, the stream goes on.
[139:35.43]The stream goes on.
[139:36.59]We got my wish.
[139:38.31]Life goes on.
[139:39.71]Christmas World.
[139:40.39]We're in Christmas World.
[139:41.31]Merry Christmas.
[139:49.64]This is cool.
[139:54.07]Ah, classic.
[139:56.13]The classic F word.
[139:57.33]Classic.
[139:59.13]Classic Jerma.
[140:02.27]Oh, what a classic.
[140:05.19]Okay, shit.
[140:08.07]Okay, good, good, good.
[140:11.21]And?
[140:11.91]Hang on, hang on.
[140:12.71]I want to make this jump.
[140:13.31]You want to go for it?
[140:14.83]Or at least fail on it.
[140:16.83]How do you do it?
[140:17.27]You just wall jump, wing glide?
[140:18.87]You had to wall jump, wing glide when it's up in the air like that.
[140:23.80]Go ahead.
[140:29.63]Impressive.
[140:33.06]Good job!
[140:35.42]Oh.
[140:40.07]The stream goes on, everyone.
[140:42.89]The stream goes on.
[140:44.39]Oh, wow, we did it.
[140:48.28]The comedic timing of that message couldn't be better.
[140:53.42]Hold on, hold on.
[140:56.78]What is this?
[140:59.64]What's this computer?
[141:02.20]That's gotta be, like, the final boss.
[141:03.92]Like, once you beat all of the separate areas, like, there's probably five areas in the game, and when you beat each one, you get, like, a little gemstone.
[141:11.11]And when all five of them light up, there'll be, like, a World of Warcraft whirlpool.
[141:16.19]These look like they can be played.
[141:17.85]They don't look locked.
[141:18.55]They kind of do.
[141:20.65]We're gonna take a trip.
[141:21.54]Hold on.
[141:22.90]Small trip.
[141:26.32]Into the void.
[141:30.14]We're getting naked it's that's not supposed to be seen The edge of the known world it's flat after all people Just a square, okay Well that sucks We could have done like a whole nother land
[141:49.87]Still about, uh, two and a half hours.
[141:51.71]Nah, that's not, that's not bad for, like, early.
[141:53.57]Well, if you think about it, right?
[141:55.67]Hopefully.
[141:56.17]If you think about it, the future levels are supposed to be, like, twice as hard.
[141:59.98]Or more.
[142:00.96]Right, let's go here, though.
[142:02.30]And there's gonna be 40 more, I guess.
[142:05.14]So... And a level creator.
[142:08.86]You just walk left to right.
[142:09.88]This is like a work in progress.
[142:12.78]But there's nothing to be done here at all.
[142:14.98]There is.
[142:15.16]Well, I pushed Y. Oh, wait a minute.
[142:17.46]We collected gems.
[142:19.05]Yeah, I collected a gem.
[142:20.31]This is where the gems go.
[142:21.69]What does it do?
[142:23.63]It just kills you.
[142:24.07]It does burn you.
[142:24.89]It just kills you.
[142:27.25]It might do something with the thing in the middle that I was talking about with the gems.
[142:32.69]Okay.
[142:33.65]I doubt we can, like, get any more levels, but... Let's see what that did.
[142:38.68]Okay, this is one.
[142:54.02]Try going back up?
[142:57.76]I wonder what that even does.
[142:59.72]You're probably right.
[143:03.90]I'm gonna guess nothing for now.
[143:05.62]Probably nothing right now, no.
[143:09.48]What's going on?
[143:10.72]Fred disconnected.
[143:12.02]Oh.
[143:14.88]Okay.
[143:16.76]Why?
[143:17.04]What'd you do?
[143:17.63]I didn't do anything.
[143:19.54]I wanna look, though.
[143:20.28]Okay, what is this, uh, Arcade Levels?
[143:23.08]That's, like, the online... Levels.
[143:26.09]Oh, okay.
[143:26.85]Somebody would have had to have made something for us to be able to play them.
[143:30.07]Oh, alright.
[143:30.35]Let's- Are they there?
[143:31.41]I think we can- I can make a level.
[143:32.21]Let's make one.
[143:32.53]Yeah, I'm gonna make a level.
[143:34.27]You know what's funny?
[143:34.99]I- How do you leave?
[143:35.78]Uh, I don't know.
[143:37.94]How did you disconnect?
[143:38.82]Oh, there we go.
[143:39.98]This looks really, really complicated.
[143:41.42]I bet it is, and it's not easy making everything on, like, a timer.
[143:48.19]Okay.
[143:49.57]I'm gonna look at the Steam Workshop, see if anyone's made any.
[143:52.56]There's four levels right now, and two of them look like that they just saved the very first thing they put down.
[143:59.88]Well, okay, you can click and drag.
[144:02.08]Alright, this is not... I'm not clicking and dragging, um... Okay, there's only one that actually looks like a level.
[144:13.71]Maybe two.
[144:17.01]I'm not sure what's happening here, but this is not supposed to be working.
[144:21.29]I don't... Where am I?
[144:26.38]I don't think you can do this online, though.
[144:28.88]Oh, I have... Yeah, it has a level editor, but it doesn't have online enabled.
[144:36.99]Oh, okay.
[144:39.43]Unless maybe I have to be online?
[144:44.37]I am.
[144:44.71]It was kind of messed up for me.
[144:45.79]It's making me do a million of these, even if I just want to do one.
[144:51.27]I have to click, I guess.
[144:53.43]Okay, that works.
[144:54.83]Okay, well, I am in a user-generated level.
[144:57.49]How did you do that?
[144:58.75]I just downloaded it from Steam Workshop real quick and jumped in.
[145:03.15]How do I get out of here?
[145:05.70]It's pretty basic.
[145:06.60]I mean, it's just... It reminds me of the... What was that game where you push the little kid in the buggy and everyone gets their limbs chopped off?
[145:14.58]Yeah, let me see what people... Super Bucky Boys.
[145:17.20]What was it called?
[145:20.20]Let's get it.
[145:22.46]I'm getting all four of these.
[145:23.38]Okay.
[145:28.13]Do you have to restart the game or no?
[145:31.47]Nope.
[145:32.05]It is immediate.
[145:33.27]Really?
[145:34.15]Yep.
[145:38.29]Uh, you sure?
[145:39.97]Yep.
[145:42.28]I don't see it.
[145:47.34]Happy Wheels, that's the one, yeah.
[145:48.92]Reminds me of Happy Wheels levels.
[145:50.48]Happy Wheels.
[145:54.07]Jackass the video game.
[145:57.89]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[145:58.69]There we go.
[146:00.17]There we go, okay.
[146:01.85]We're gonna go Playground.
[146:04.26]Trying real hard not to complain about the wall jumping mechanic.
[146:08.61]Yeah, see?
[146:11.57]Okay.
[146:12.69]Let's try this created level.
[146:15.47]It's called Playground.
[146:18.13]Is that the one that I'm doing with the buzz saws and the bubbles at the bottom?
[146:22.12]No, it's just a big open space.
[146:25.14]And it's an uncompletable level.
[146:29.40]This level is not a completable.
[146:31.74]Alright, good first try here.
[146:34.91]Nice work in progress.
[146:37.77]Playground.
[146:38.95]Okay.
[146:39.35]It's so difficult to just jump the minimum amount.
[146:46.63]Onwards and upwards.
[146:47.43]I think that's the one you're doing.
[146:49.32]Uh, probably.
[146:49.88]Okay, let's give it a try.
[146:53.02]You are gonna get so frustrated.
[146:54.88]Am I?
[146:55.34]What are these bubbles?
[147:02.08]It's the part after the bubbles.
[147:08.36]Oh!
[147:09.42]Uh-huh.
[147:10.36]That's not cool.
[147:12.44]Uh-huh.
[147:14.98]You know, I... When somebody gets their hands on this and makes something really, really cool, that's going to be cool.
[147:24.52]You know, I've got to give credit where credit is due.
[147:27.00]They're pioneers.
[147:28.12]These guys have made a level.
[147:31.04]They did make a level, and I think you can beat it, but I can't prove that.
[147:34.16]Oh, God.
[147:39.36]Yeah, well, I can't prove it.
[147:41.72]It may not be completed.
[147:45.94]Is it like Mario Maker?
[147:46.78]Do you have to be able to beat your own level to be able to put it on?
[147:51.18]I don't know.
[147:54.80]Essentially, it's just Mario Maker with less to do, probably.
[147:58.86]Finally.
[148:00.12]Did you beat it?
[148:01.32]Not yet.
[148:03.34]The part after the buzz saws, they've got like hidden spikes in the clouds.
[148:08.14]What you meant to say was exit to main menu and not do it.
[148:11.13]Hang on, I can do this.
[148:12.87]My throat is like bothering me.
[148:13.93]I don't know why.
[148:14.57]Okay, I can't do it.
[148:15.41]But you're right.
[148:16.01]Exit to main menu and it doesn't really look completable.
[148:22.08]What's this one?
[148:22.50]I don't know.
[148:23.48]Good job.
[148:23.94]You tried.
[148:28.52]This is dropping boulders.
[148:30.14]He's like, yeah, might as well drop some boulders too.
[148:34.24]That's funny.
[148:36.58]This one actually looks like, oh, the dropping boulder one.
[148:39.52]Yeah, I guess I just died to that.
[148:41.62]What are you supposed to do?
[148:47.24]How do you even get past the first jump?
[148:49.12]I don't even know how I got past the first jump.
[148:50.86]I really have no idea.
[148:55.74]Oh, okay.
[148:58.32]It's gonna be very, very close.
[149:00.50]That's all.
[149:05.58]Okay, that's not it.
[149:07.20]I kinda did it.
[149:08.78]Kind of.
[149:11.88]I... One more try.
[149:14.86]Alright, one more.
[149:17.92]I seriously had it.
[149:30.69]I had it.
[149:32.19]It's gotta be like a good jump.
[149:40.72]I give up.
[149:42.12]That's enough.
[149:42.52]I'm gonna get it.
[149:44.90]I promise.
[149:46.20]What are you?
[149:46.56]Okay, so you have to make a Superman.
[149:48.40]I promise I'm gonna leave.
[149:49.14]That's what I was gonna say.
[149:52.87]Is it over?
[149:53.73]You gotta fly across.
[149:54.83]There's one more level to try.
[149:55.79]I tried flying.
[149:57.05]Yeah, you gotta launch.
[150:02.55]Oh, I think I get it.
[150:03.33]Wait, this is the same one.
[150:09.87]I think I get it.
[150:10.49]I died.
[150:19.65]I think I can do this.
[150:20.51]This guy is 50%.
[150:23.59]Almost.
[150:26.71]Fifty percent of every Steam workshop level is this guy And he added a bridge this time and you die at the end Alright Alright, so what do you want to do up now?
[150:44.18]What do you want to do for the next like like 45 minutes?
[150:46.40]45 minutes do I don't know you pick now.
[150:51.41]Let's see what you want to look like like in real life coin tossing
[150:56.85]Let's see.
[151:02.35]That was still fun, though.
[151:03.29]I had fun.
[151:04.23]I did have fun, yeah.
[151:06.79]Doesn't all work, but it's all pretty fun.
[151:09.23]Should we just play GTA again?
[151:11.49]Oh, no.
[151:12.67]I'd have to leave you to that because it just screws up my computer so bad.
[151:16.51]Yeah.
[151:17.21]How about... No, Finding Bigfoot.
[151:23.95]Everybody's telling me to play Spore.
[151:25.19]You guys want me to just make a monster in Spore?
[151:27.92]That like, can Etalyx do that with me?
[151:29.72]He can't.
[151:35.41]Etalyx can't make a monster with me in Spore.
[151:48.52]This is 45 minutes of Spore is all you need to get.
