[ve:61.1.100]

[03:34.16]Thank you.
[05:01.91]How many years has it been?
[05:21.98]How many years has it been?
[05:26.73]10,000 probably.
[05:33.19]Igor!
[05:35.10]My servant, Igor.
[05:39.62]Oh!
[05:41.26]Oh, hello!
[05:42.03]I didn't know Igor was going to set a camera up this quickly.
[05:47.45]It's a great pleasure to meet you on this great Hallow's Eve.
[05:52.04]Oh, man, I was expecting at least to get into the salon, maybe, and get into the hair.
[05:57.38]My name is Count Jerkula, and I'm here to present to you, or present to the world, myself,
[06:02.79]And of course, I planned this.
[06:05.96]They buried me 10,000 years ago, and I told them, I want you to have that casket come off when the SEGA CD comes out.
[06:14.95]I heard about it.
[06:15.65]I looked through my globe.
[06:16.79]I have one of those wizard globes, and I looked through it, and I saw this great console stereo sound.
[06:22.33]That's unbelievable.
[06:24.04]Stereo sound.
[06:29.14]And it smells.
[06:31.09]But stereo sound, I've heard they made a game about it.
[06:51.97]Oh!
[06:55.45]Oops.
[06:56.92]Hold on.
[06:59.34]They made a game about me, kid.
[07:01.60]It's Halloween.
[07:04.03]I need to be prepared for this.
[07:06.17]The cape is in here.
[07:07.09]Why would they bury me with the cape on?
[07:08.57]Igor!
[07:11.43]You curmudgeon Igor.
[07:16.64]There's somebody at the door.
[07:17.80]The traitor's at the door.
[07:26.31]Yes, hello, kids.
[07:27.63]How are you?
[07:32.15]And what are you for Halloween this year?
[07:35.65]Spider-Man.
[07:37.13]Oh, look at you, Spider-Man.
[07:39.31]I don't know what that is.
[07:41.54]I mean, if you were a ghoul.
[07:44.64]And you?
[07:47.10]Two Spider-Mans.
[07:49.90]That's too many Spider-Mans.
[07:52.19]That's too many Spider-Mans.
[07:54.59]And you?
[07:55.35]You look incredible.
[07:57.65]The only Incredible Hulk.
[07:59.05]I was right there.
[07:59.97]I nailed it.
[08:02.22]Okay, yeah, I'll take how many you want.
[08:04.50]There's blood on these, though.
[08:05.90]Yeah.
[08:07.12]Okay.
[08:08.46]Yeah, Mom and Dad, there's blood all over these.
[08:12.73]Yeah, okay.
[08:13.83]So you don't want any.
[08:15.43]Okay.
[08:17.92]Okay.
[08:18.40]Well, that was just somebody shooting a crossbow at the house.
[08:22.10]It's okay.
[08:22.96]I just woke up.
[08:23.70]It's been 10,000 years.
[08:25.20]I'll get to it, though.
[08:26.45]I'll make sure that, yeah, of course.
[08:28.11]Happy Halloween, kids!
[08:33.86]Okay.
[08:38.44]Let's go to my domain and play Dracula Unleashed for the same CD.
[08:59.98]Of course we're going to be in my domain.
[09:03.22]Peasants?
[09:04.66]A voice crack this early is not good.
[09:09.95]Welcome.
[09:10.85]I just ran up here.
[09:13.07]Just scooted on up here to the next room.
[09:17.57]He said he looks like Michael Jackson.
[09:21.46]This is Count Jerkula.
[09:23.30]Okay.
[09:28.30]What happened to the audio?
[09:30.05]Where did Igor screw up the audio?
[09:33.39]I was trying to play screaming sound effects.
[09:39.14]How do you like the room?
[09:48.05]Why do I look so much younger?
[09:52.62]Consume enough blood and you'll be fine.
[09:56.04]But don't do that though, it's Halloween.
[10:00.81]Okay.
[10:02.49]Sorry I'm late.
[10:04.43]Obviously, I did all this.
[10:07.43]Goth Jerma?
[10:09.07]What a goth.
[10:11.67]What a stupid thing to say.
[10:14.34]Igor, time that person out for 10,000 years.
[10:23.41]This is something that I've wanted to do for like three years, and I never did it.
[10:27.33]And I've talked about it, and I've been sick every single time I've tried to do this.
[10:33.30]Uh, so we're not sick anymore and we're good to go.
[10:37.46]I may already be drunk.
[10:39.33]Okay.
[10:40.31]I've had quite a few bloods and vodkas.
[10:45.83]Was the audio actually fucked up or was it just for one little part?
[10:58.04]Yeah.
[10:58.20]Cause what I was trying to, I was trying to play like people screaming.
[11:01.78]It was me just laying in the casket.
[11:03.41]You're supposed to hear like...
[11:06.13]It was so awkward, me just sitting there quiet.
[11:10.44]It's alright.
[11:11.16]It's still good.
[11:12.16]Hey, we'll get the clean audio to the second channel.
[11:16.06]It got noise gated?
[11:17.01]No, it didn't.
[11:17.65]No.
[11:21.23]Maybe we should have done my hands?
[11:25.56]No, we're good.
[11:27.10]By the way...
[11:28.36]This is what we're doing tonight.
[11:29.54]Happy Halloween, by the way.
[11:30.67]It's the first time I've ever been in costume on stream ever.
[11:33.73]Besides Deadpool, like two years ago.
[11:42.11]We're doing, we got Dracula.
[11:44.79]We have Frankenstein.
[11:47.82]And then we've got Dracula Unleashed.
[11:49.74]I have no idea what's going to happen.
[11:51.56]All I know is I'm going to start.
[11:57.05]Clown?
[11:57.65]Oh, yeah, I did do the clown.
[11:58.63]That's right.
[12:03.62]And yes, I'm well aware of what...
[12:05.90]Okay.
[12:08.39]Hold on a second.
[12:09.71]I know that when I was tipping over, it looked a little funky, okay?
[12:17.15]It looked kind of fucked up, but there's nothing I could do about it.
[12:20.51]There's nothing I could do about it.
[12:21.53]I was laughing my ass off about it earlier.
[12:24.06]Holly and I were just like, oh no.
[12:26.16]When I was putting it on her.
[12:27.90]It's like, that's not good.
[12:29.59]I don't give a fuck.
[12:30.85]Whatever.
[12:35.71]I think I woke up.
[12:36.35]It's been 10,000 years.
[12:38.62]Oh my god.
[12:39.38]Alright.
[12:39.94]Are you guys ready?
[12:44.87]Let's play.
[12:46.29]We got a few games to go through.
[12:47.67]And if, look, if these take like an hour or two, I got that DS horror game.
[12:54.52]We can do that too.
[12:55.88]This shit's supposed to glow in the dark.
[12:57.10]Is this glowing in the dark?
[12:58.49]Dude, I forgot I did this.
[12:59.53]Look at how cool this is.
[13:02.05]Are you cutting your hair after this?
[13:03.23]Probably.
[13:06.37]This is literally why I did this.
[13:08.86]I kept the hair this long to do this.
[13:12.08]So probably yes.
[13:15.49]It's not dark though.
[13:16.43]I'm trying to get a ton of light on it.
[13:18.09]So later on, I'll turn it off.
[13:20.67]Alright, let's go.
[13:21.39]SEGA CD time.
[13:23.54]I should be able to do this.
[13:27.44]Hey, look at that.
[13:28.02]I keep hearing, I keep seeing Michael Jackson and it's fucking with me.
[13:35.97]How dare you?
[13:37.67]You peasant.
[13:39.31]Don't talk to me like that.
[13:40.34]I'm streaming.
[13:42.06]I'm a streamer now.
[13:44.49]Okay, do you like the Castlevania music?
[13:46.74]I thought it was pretty lit.
[13:54.55]I'm ready to do this.
[13:55.27]Let's just turn it on.
[13:58.83]This is, okay, this is Frankenstein.
[14:00.36]Frankenstein's already in there.
[14:05.78]Here we go.
[14:13.89]There was no screaming, that's so stupid.
[14:23.98]Frankenstein!
[14:26.43]It's the last time I'm ever dressing up for Halloween.
[14:29.55]I grew my hair for a year for you, okay?
[14:32.74]I grew my hair for a year for you!
[14:40.21]It's vodka cranberry in there, if you're curious.
[14:48.48]Okay, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.
[14:50.91]This game requires 24 blocks.
[14:52.99]What do you think that is, like 10 kilobytes?
[15:10.93]Okay, Sony ImageSoft, cool.
[15:15.48]Turn the lights off.
[15:16.96]You need to see me first.
[15:19.15]This is coming off.
[15:20.33]Okay, hold on.
[15:21.03]Hold on.
[15:21.69]Quiet.
[15:23.03]We got a dog shit FMV to look at.
[15:24.89]I can't even see what that...
[15:39.28]I can't even read that.
[15:44.25]I can't read that.
[15:48.22]That's the music I like!

[17:29.53]I don't know what this is now.
[17:33.05]Is it a coffin?
[17:39.06]By the way, I was thinking about getting one of those bear ass things to put on my bear ass.
[17:44.06]And I was going to turn around and I was going to be the bear ass bush light vampire.
[17:49.79]But I couldn't get one in time.
[17:54.85]You know one of those like funny like, oh, look, it's a bear ass Halloween costume.
[18:00.22]Okay, by the way, you know how many secret penises I saw at the fucking Halloween store?
[18:04.39]I want an apology from everybody.
[18:06.53]There were 10, at least, secret penis costumes at the Halloween store.
[18:16.32]I'm just telling you, it's the truth.
[18:21.10]I didn't buy any?
[18:21.88]No, I'm not gonna, I'm Count Jerkula.

[18:36.53]Alright, turn it on!
[18:44.64]Eureka!

[21:18.75]This one just kind of hurts my head.
[21:30.62]Do that whole sequence again, please.
[21:34.68]Victor Frankenstein's lab, Ingolstadt, February 1793.
[21:39.01]What the fuck is this game?
[22:01.95]This is too loud.
[22:03.17]I have to turn the game down.
[22:06.41]Do I have a punch?
[22:11.43]Oh, electric eels!
[22:17.38]Oh, this is hurting me.
[22:28.45]Ow, that's acid!
[22:32.67]Where am I supposed to go?
[22:43.70]Clock?
[22:53.85]I think I need to unlock this before I can go through.
[23:01.20]Okay, I need a key.
[23:10.96]Okay.
[23:13.16]Where would I get a key?
[23:19.31]Dude, the music is kinda sick!

[23:43.45]Oh wait, can I?

[23:59.78]What?
[24:01.44]Okay.
[24:04.23]I just ate the fucking bread, I didn't want to eat the bread!
[24:10.76]Bottle of dissolve away acid with corrosion around the rim.
[24:18.97]Use that acid.
[24:23.92]Use it on the door?
[24:37.21]Okay, maybe I use it on a locked door.
[24:43.16]Wait, maybe on the eels?
[24:47.65]Acid spray.
[24:48.25]The label says stand next to the target and depress the plunger.
[24:57.50]They have been dissolved by the acid.
[24:59.28]They won't trouble me now.
[25:06.83]Hey, what about in here?
[25:13.77]There's a monster under there.
[25:15.03]Store room.
[25:23.55]What's going on?
[25:27.31]What the fuck?
[25:29.86]Why is this like Street Fighter?
[25:33.65]This is not what I thought this game was gonna be.
[25:36.37]Versus a mutant?
[25:41.77]This is fucking stupid!
[25:46.63]I thought this was a point-and-click adventure game!
[25:54.28]Headbutt, headbutt, headbutt, headbutt!
[26:05.84]Yeah!
[26:06.22]Give me another one!

[26:08.02]Give me another one!
[26:12.53]Get the fuck out of here!
[26:19.84]Just beat his ass.
[26:27.31]Alright, what did that do for me?
[26:35.72]Chloroform, sniff, makes me feel sleepy.
[26:39.98]There's nothing to use this on, alright.
[26:43.65]What is this?
[26:50.78]What are these bugs?
[26:51.58]Can I do something with the bugs?
[26:55.16]Why do you walk like a penguin?
[26:56.78]I don't know.
[26:57.29]Alright, well I got chloroform.
[27:09.24]Alright, this game is actually pretty sick.
[27:15.59]Let's keep going left.
[27:22.88]Okay, there's a door over here.
[27:33.59]Victor's bedroom.
[27:37.98]What do I do?
[27:42.20]Please help me!
[27:45.37]Oh, God, what have I done?
[28:03.46]You are a vile abomination!
[28:06.69]Come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark that I negligently bestowed!
[28:13.91]It's a Street Fighter segment.
[28:14.93]I have to beat the fuck out of this guy.
[28:19.74]What?
[28:20.22]I'm gonna... Victor?
[28:24.01]Oh, this guy knows a lot of moves.
[28:35.67]I gotta play total defense here.
[28:37.51]Fuck!
[28:38.03]No!
[28:38.33]What happens if you die?
[28:45.69]This is stupid.
[28:51.51]Alright, alright.
[28:57.88]Press B and C to save the game?
[29:02.44]What?
[29:05.29]Save game to RAM.
[29:08.85]Okay, yeah, sure.
[29:11.60]How the hell did you know that?
[29:14.10]Alright, I gotta beat him.
[29:21.51]Why am I just fighting everybody that I talk to?
[29:29.42]Okay, I gotta be ready.
[29:37.37]I'm gonna try blocking more.
[29:44.70]Does that hurt still?
[29:45.84]Oh my god, it does.
[29:54.96]He's gonna flawless victory me.
[30:01.33]I got moves.
[30:02.19]I got Street Fighter moves.
[30:03.27]Hold on.
[30:06.67]I can, like, clap his ears.
[30:12.28]Hold on a second.
[30:14.04]I got this.
[30:34.18]Shit!
[30:41.23]I tried to use it on him!
[30:42.77]Maybe I have to use it on him.
[31:02.04]I gotta lock in, sorry.
[31:04.46]Nothing to say right now.
[31:12.20]What the fuck?
[31:33.98]I'm so glad that person told me how to save.
[31:45.23]What an odd game.
[31:50.52]Can I even beat Victor?
[31:52.16]Should I try to chloroform him?
[31:58.07]I will do what I can for the SEGA CD.
[32:06.06]That's good.
[32:11.65]Uh, practice fights?
[32:14.95]Something looks weird.
[32:16.19]P-R-A-C-T-I-S-E?
[32:27.57]Franken, ahhh!
[32:34.81]I took a bong rip out of a pumpkin, if they're the Halloween spirit.
[32:38.54]Hey, relax.
[32:43.12]Okay, let me try, let me actually try to chloroform him.
[32:46.23]Let me try.
[32:56.98]Vile peasant.
[33:03.82]Okay, so it's A, C. Okay, A, C. Okay, let me see if I can get him.
[33:15.46]You're a vile creature, here we go.
[33:16.80]A, C. I just beat him?
[33:27.39]A big gold key with three loops at the top.
[33:30.94]Oh my god, I got the key.
[33:32.16]Alright, is he gonna wake up?
[33:34.75]I gotta go.
[33:44.61]There are no- oh wait, there's a locked door out here.
[33:59.81]This music reminds me of Look Outside.
[34:02.70]Which, by the way, is probably the game of the year, by the way.
[34:05.00]I played it off-stream, and I'm sorry.
[34:06.46]It was an unbelievable experience.
[34:08.08]Game of the year.
[34:10.99]It's game of the year.
[34:16.54]If you haven't played Look Outside, go get it.
[34:18.58]Right now, that is a...
[34:20.06]Hold on.
[34:22.86]Wait, B and C, right?
[34:31.34]What'd I just do?
[34:38.47]Is this FrankenVision?
[34:42.93]He's got really fucking bad eyesight.
[34:47.24]Oh shit.
[34:48.14]I can't really see.
[34:49.68]Aren't people gonna freak out when they see me?
[34:59.84]The town of Ingolstadt, Germany.
[35:08.51]It just got a big, yeah, 2.0.
[35:09.95]Look outside, 2.0.
[35:12.21]I'm telling you, go get it.
[35:13.23]Like, if you like, it's a turn-based RPG, but it's not.
[35:16.92]It's way more than that.
[35:19.28]The game is sick.
[35:23.43]Okay.
[35:26.87]This game just became a top-down game.
[35:31.53]This is...
[35:32.23]This game is bizarre.
[35:38.90]It's been three different video games.
[35:40.94]Can I fight the pigs?
[35:51.40]I can't get... Get out of the way!
[35:57.00]Okay, so I approach this person?
[35:59.68]Go away, you hideous inbreed.
[36:05.75]Hey!
[36:07.29]Okay, city's stable.
[36:26.80]There's a cat up there.
[36:31.52]Wait, I can grab this, right?
[36:33.98]I can't get that?
[36:35.13]This bag is full of pellets.
[36:38.47]I need to tempt the horse away from the cart with the pellets.
[36:49.03]Alright, let's do it!
[36:56.08]Tempt the horse away from the cart.
[36:57.28]How do I put it down?
[37:00.55]Am I gonna get kicked in the face?
[37:02.47]I should put things back where I find them.
[37:07.31]Okay.
[37:10.20]Alright, not yet.
[37:10.74]I might need another, uh, different item.
[37:39.75]What are they saying?
[37:47.80]Okay, so can I go in here?
[37:48.88]Your webcam's not aligned.
[37:55.72]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[37:56.63]Hold on, this is a save moment.
[38:00.87]Your webcam's not aligned perfectly.
[38:02.65]Help, get us out of here.
[38:03.51]Sorry, there's a one guy in my chat that's mad that I don't have my webcam correct.
[38:10.69]Jeez.
[38:17.26]Where'd the spider go?
[38:22.95]Where's the spider?
[38:23.45]Oh, there he is.
[38:28.56]Should I have my hair a little different?
[38:35.79]This is the only time you're ever going to get this, by the way.
[38:37.91]In a fucking hundred million years.
[38:44.07]Oh yeah, all you fucking weirdos that have been looking for this for like a decade, is that you're never getting this ever again.
[38:52.61]There.
[39:02.70]Alright, how do I get, I, how do I get him out?
[39:08.07]I don't even, okay, should I fight, am I gonna street fight or fight the dog?
[39:13.89]No.
[39:15.73]No, it's not, right?
[39:30.55]Dude, imagine seeing this shit.
[39:33.86]Dude, nice back dodge by Dog.
[39:52.94]Alright, I don't wanna f- I wanted to give him, like, pellets or treats or something.
[40:04.37]Oh, I don't like how he turned red.
[40:05.71]He turned fucking red!
[40:14.54]Alright, was it- did I save these people?
[40:16.28]I don't even have a key!
[40:21.44]I can't even let them out!
[40:24.07]Can I just grab the fucking bars and just...
[40:28.80]I can't use that here.
[40:29.74]I need a key.
[40:30.34]Alright.
[40:30.80]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[40:33.53]I'll be back.
[40:49.16]Okay.
[40:59.46]I guess I should save it for sure.
[41:07.87]Dude, the SEGA CD.
[41:09.01]What a console.
[41:10.36]I'm so glad that I woke up 10,000 years in the future for this.
[41:15.48]Whatever.
[41:15.82]Talk to me.
[41:19.41]Talk to me!
[41:31.68]Now get out of the way!
[41:35.10]Oh my god, get out of the way.
[41:53.13]10,040.
[41:56.52]Miss Rhine.
[42:01.36]The... spiders... Alright, I gotta fight the spiders, straight fighter style.
[42:16.26]I'm dying!
[42:22.85]I think my games crashed.
[42:24.88]Can games crash for the SEGA CD?
[42:39.82]Oh, this music gets me every time.
[42:44.94]You got killed by spiders.
[42:45.98]It's fine.
[42:52.15]You guys having a good Halloween?
[43:02.34]No!
[43:02.66]I can't help you there.
[43:18.22]Alright, I'm going to do this one for another 20 minutes.
[43:23.93]And then we'll move on to Dracula.
[43:25.33]We got two Dracula games.
[43:27.51]Bram Stoker's Dracula.
[43:30.34]And that's hard to say when you've had three fucking blood vodkas.
[43:34.92]Bram Stoker's Dracula.
[43:37.98]And then Dracula Unleashed.
[43:41.75]I don't know why.
[43:42.23]I don't know.
[44:00.92]Okay, spiders in here.
[44:08.63]How do I avoid them?
[44:10.94]Should I put pellets on the ground?
[44:16.75]I'm not trying to leave!
[44:29.03]Oh, I got bottle filled with some liquid?
[44:34.06]Get off me, get off me!
[44:35.90]Get off me!
[44:40.61]Okay.
[44:42.35]I got out.
[44:43.50]I have no health.
[44:48.76]What do I do with this liquid?
[44:52.96]Step on the spiders?
[45:05.94]I just did, it hurt.
[45:10.70]Okay, what is this liquid?
[45:14.02]Sleeping potion.
[45:17.45]Okay.
[45:19.74]Who should I give that to?
[45:32.56]Who should I give that to?
[45:35.40]I should drink it?
[45:36.32]I don't think I should drink that.
[45:40.80]He knows he looks good, he keeps checking himself out.
[45:44.97]No.
[45:45.93]See, here's the thing.
[45:46.63]Chat is...
[45:47.41]I moved chat.
[45:48.33]Chat is right there.
[45:49.47]And the OBS preview is here.
[45:53.22]So... You do look good, though.
[46:06.59]Once a year.
[46:09.20]He keeps checking himself out.
[46:14.64]This is the only time of year that adults get to have any fun, okay?
[46:21.48]Where do I take it?
[46:24.19]Should I go all the- should I give Victor the potion again?
[46:26.25]He's not gonna be awake, right?
[46:36.71]Hey dude, you play video games for a living.
[46:39.57]I used to play video games for a living.
[46:42.85]Now I dress up as fucking Dracula.
[46:50.34]Okay, what should I do with this potion?
[47:00.66]Ugh!
[47:03.08]Anyone know where I should take this?
[47:04.16]I don't know.
[47:06.07]Sleeping?
[47:06.63]I got a sleeping potion and I have... ...these pellets.
[47:10.11]I feel like the horse can take the pellets.
[47:11.57]I don't know why I can't do it.
[47:15.50]Guess I missed something here.
[47:20.41]Dude, you're a 50-year-old twink.
[47:22.18]You really are a vampire.
[47:24.26]Banned that person for 10,000 years.
[47:27.16]Can vampires even see themselves in OBS?
[47:30.55]It's not really a mirror.
[47:31.61]Wait, can a vampire get recorded?
[47:36.24]If you take a picture of a vampire, is he on the picture?
[47:40.75]Ugh.
[47:45.23]You just made me fuck up my cape!
[47:54.06]You fucked my cape up!
[48:06.26]I really- I don't know where to take this.
[48:10.32]I feel like the- No, no, no, no, no, no.
[48:11.92]I don't want to be here.
[48:16.47]Who do I give the sleeping potion to?
[48:17.79]Because I can't go to the right.
[48:20.79]I don't just give it to one of these people, right?
[48:28.84]Anybody know what to do?
[48:33.65]I'm not quite ready to move on from this one because I think it's great.
[48:37.32]Go to stable and use pellets at the door.
[48:39.78]Alert, thank you.
[48:41.65]Yeah, we allow back seating here.
[48:44.75]As long as I get to drive the car, I don't give a shit.
[49:09.44]Where is the stable?
[49:15.13]Right here, right?
[49:22.08]Yeah, alright.
[49:22.72]Somebody said use it right when you're at the front door.
[49:24.60]I need to tempt that horse away.
[49:31.57]Oh, come on, dude.
[49:37.48]Ah!
[49:38.87]He just tried to kick me!
[49:45.69]I got some dry hay.
[49:51.41]Okay, that's it, right?
[49:54.00]Now what do I do with hay?
[50:07.34]I don't know, but that CD quality audio is really getting to me.
[50:12.87]Go put it behind the horse.
[50:14.73]Okay, the horse is...
[50:18.44]If I get kicked in the fucking face, then I'm making sure it's saved.
[50:29.88]I don't think he's gonna kick me.
[50:33.20]Nope.
[50:40.97]I need hay.
[50:44.22]What do I do with the hay?
[50:49.95]Any CD quality enjoyers know what to do with the hay?
[50:54.57]Go to town screen and head south from the archway.
[50:57.86]I love how I can just look over here and there's just answers.
[51:06.79]Okay, these old games are fucked, okay?
[51:09.53]We all know that.
[51:11.28]It's south from the archway.
[51:16.97]Okay, I didn't even know that was an entrance.
[51:18.39]How was I supposed to know that?
[51:22.17]Oh, I had fangs that were in.
[51:23.97]No.
[51:25.92]No, I'm not wearing those.
[51:28.04]I'm not wearing those for like five hours.
[51:30.22]It's not happening.
[51:34.35]Get lost, freak.
[51:40.17]Okay, there's chickens down here.
[51:43.04]These guards?
[51:46.04]Oh shit.
[51:55.62]This guy, this George Washington guy with a sword!
[51:58.13]How am I supposed to fight him?
[52:00.25]And he just bowed on, he just bowed on my corpse.
[52:12.47]Okay.
[52:13.37]Well, I'm not fighting those guys.
[52:21.38]City guard room.
[52:26.29]Nothing.
[52:29.53]Nothing here.
[52:31.49]Wait, sleeping potion maybe somewhere?
[52:33.36]That's what I would think, maybe.
[52:36.48]No?
[52:40.33]No.
[52:53.00]Jailer's house.
[52:58.07]Oh god.
[52:59.27]I'm thirsty.
[52:59.91]Have you got anything to drink?
[53:01.50]Uh, yeah.
[53:10.15]Oh, should I get the key and I can rescue those people?
[53:13.84]How many keys can I take?
[53:14.70]All of them?
[53:18.06]Okay, now I have the keys, I can save those people.
[53:24.54]When's he gonna put the costume on?
[53:29.29]I got a sick werewolf mask, dude.
[53:34.43]I'm gonna snarl into the cam.
[53:46.79]Anything else I can do here?
[53:56.81]Store owner.
[53:58.85]Wait, save the game.
[53:59.99]I don't want to get killed.
[54:03.37]You know what?
[54:03.86]What an insane feature.
[54:06.34]Can I just say?
[54:08.68]That's kind of crazy.
[54:10.90]That there was a save feature like that in the game.
[54:14.14]This is before memory cards, guys.
[54:15.61]This is the SEGA Genesis.
[54:18.47]This is SEGA Genesis Model 2, SEGA CD Model 2.
[54:22.27]Saving to memory?
[54:25.62]You kidding me?
[54:29.60]I feel like I can take that.
[54:36.48]I can't interact with this?
[54:44.63]What a great console this is.
[54:47.53]Arguably one of the best.
[54:51.78]Real collector's items, you know?
[54:55.94]The whole library really is just a super collector's item.
[55:04.12]Use hay on candles.
[55:05.54]Alert.
[55:10.13]Thank you.
[55:18.22]Dude, it worked!
[55:23.70]Oh, shit.
[55:24.90]Hey, fool!
[55:25.54]Get out of here!
[55:26.08]My house is on fire!
[55:28.65]I don't know.
[55:29.13]I didn't do it.
[55:31.65]Who is this guy?
[55:35.36]Help!
[55:35.70]Help!
[55:35.96]I have some fire!
[55:36.68]Can I- should I put it out?
[55:40.93]Why am I just a menace?
[55:44.35]What?
[55:44.65]I don't even know why I did that.
[55:46.87]Now get the guards.
[55:51.58]Help!
[55:51.84]Help!
[55:52.34]Where should I go?
[55:55.19]I could unlock that, uh, the gate, right?
[55:57.71]Let me unlock the, uh, people that are locked up.
[56:01.96]You gonna play water park sim ever again?
[56:04.72]Uh, no.
[56:07.69]Probably not.
[56:09.43]It's a fun game.
[56:20.48]Where were those people?
[56:21.21]No!
[56:28.05]We've got to get to the first...
[56:28.93]Okay, I'll move on when we get to the first boss.
[56:31.78]I've got to unplug one of my headphones.
[56:33.44]I can't even hear myself talk.
[56:35.68]Okay, that's better.
[56:38.42]Uh, where, where is he?
[56:50.31]Make the cam bigger.
[56:52.05]When we change games, I will make it, alright, I got a, I got a question for you.

[57:47.09]Huh?
[57:51.84]So what did that even do?
[57:52.66]These people didn't even give me anything.
[57:53.78]What did I even do with this?
[57:57.47]Should I go back outside?
[57:58.67]Are they out... Maybe they... Are they fighting the guards?
[58:04.92]Oh, they distract the guards.
[58:07.10]Oh, okay.
[58:10.07]Alright.

[58:29.48]What was to the left?
[58:35.25]Where do I go from here?
[58:41.58]There's insane chatters tonight.
[58:43.82]Okay, dude, it's Halloween.
[58:45.30]I don't know what you want me to do.
[58:46.94]We could just ban the whole chat.
[58:52.47]There are freaks here.
[58:53.47]Oh, shit.
[58:57.28]Dude, yeah, there are freaks in chat.
[59:04.71]Was there an area I couldn't go before?
[59:07.09]Ghouls?
[59:10.74]Yeah, it's Halloween.
[59:11.92]It's gonna be like this.
[59:13.58]So where should I go from here?
[59:16.86]Down?
[59:24.73]Okay, then to the left.
[59:26.56]So what was over here?
[59:27.36]Door right there?
[59:29.76]Help, help!
[59:36.77]I think I just left the castle.
[59:58.02]That was beautiful.
[60:00.99]Uh, I thought it said Asperg.
[60:03.53]Augsburg Forest.
[60:07.38]Did it work?
[60:26.56]What if I go from the forest?
[60:40.09]Mushroom.
[60:53.04]I can't pick that up?
[60:59.17]Okay, what is the goal of the game?
[61:01.53]What am I supposed to do?
[61:02.31]I'm just kind of walking around as the Wizard of Oz right now.
[61:10.43]By the way, Tin Man, it's not about the thing about hearts.
[61:14.92]It's not about how much you love, but it's about how much you are loved by others.
[61:20.47]Of course, yes.
[61:22.96]I feel like I'm going to hand out some medals.
[61:39.18]Okay, who's here?
[61:44.17]I'm just gonna walk in this person's house?
[61:51.12]A barn.
[61:53.41]Weapon.
[61:55.09]Weapon.
[61:59.32]A pair of shears.
[62:00.36]I had better be careful, they're sharp.
[62:16.44]Why is all the movement rotoscoped?
[62:19.37]I don't know, man.
[62:19.87]It's the SEGA CD.
[62:23.13]It smells terrible, but it might be useful.
[62:24.86]Was it manure?
[62:36.73]I love that bird sound.
[62:40.02]Okay.
[62:40.84]So I have shears and manure.
[62:53.72]Is that a skunk?
[63:01.99]I wanna see if I can hang out with a skunk.
[63:14.73]I know that manure is nutritious, but am I gonna eat the manure?
[63:17.40]That's kinda weird.
[63:28.06]There's spiders everywhere here.
[63:32.81]Okay.
[63:33.15]I'm gonna go up.
[63:46.59]To the right?
[64:11.26]Why is this game an RPG, like a turn-based RPG, but you actually fight side by side?
[64:17.85]Oh God, okay.
[64:30.30]Alright, I'm done.
[64:31.82]Alright, we're gonna play Dracula now.
[64:33.21]We're gonna play the other Dracula.
[64:36.61]I haven't saved it in like 20 minutes in this game.
[64:39.55]Okay, whatever.
[64:44.03]That one was actually pretty great.
[64:52.41]That's a good starter.
[64:55.25]Good appetizer.
[64:57.19]Okay.
[64:58.67]Let's just put it in.
[65:00.50]Give me one sec.
[65:02.36]I'm going to shut it off.
[65:05.22]Okay.
[65:05.40]I'll give you guys a look at the room if you want.
[65:14.91]I want you to be able to see the SEGA CD.
[65:19.88]Hi.
[65:21.26]Welcome.
[65:21.96]Alright, can the cape come off?
[65:24.08]Can I take the cape off?
[65:31.49]I don't want to look at your room.
[65:32.43]You got to look at the SEGA CD.
[65:33.58]That's what it's here for.
[65:34.34]Alright, get this thing.
[65:41.42]It's hot in here.
[65:44.56]My ass!
[65:49.47]No, don't throw it!
[65:54.55]Okay.
[65:54.67]Let me fix the hair.
[66:00.86]Don't drop this.
[66:02.48]It's worth a lot of money.
[66:05.32]This one was twelve dollars.
[66:11.49]Here.
[66:13.57]See, we're going to play Dracula next.
[66:20.10]Weirdly enough, Frankenstein and Dracula are a combo.
[66:28.23]So if you buy Dracula, you get the Frankenstein game, which is kind of crazy.
[66:34.97]Yeah, see, I'll show you a double deal.
[66:36.67]It's pretty cool.
[66:38.59]I hope I don't break it.
[66:44.30]Yeah, see?
[66:46.04]I don't know if you can see.
[66:47.31]See, Frankenstein and Dracula.
[66:50.61]It's a double feature.
[66:54.06]Cool spider.
[66:54.64]Hey, thanks.
[66:57.79]I didn't even turn the blacklight on!
[67:03.78]Hold on.
[67:25.63]Alright.
[67:28.37]Alright, it was good.
[67:31.47]Pretty cool.
[67:33.25]Pretty, uh, pretty good.
[67:34.56]It's a pretty good light.
[67:35.72]Um, cool.
[67:38.18]Turn the lights off.
[67:40.22]Uh, I'll do that when I get back from break.
[67:42.70]Okay, uh, regular Dracula, not Dracula Unleashed.
[67:49.59]Pathetic blacklight.
[67:52.27]Okay, settle down.
[67:53.25]It's Halloween.
[67:55.92]Do it now.
[67:57.16]Settle down.
[67:57.80]It's Halloween.
[67:58.94]Are my teeth wicked yellow?
[68:00.30]When you do white face makeup, you can see how fucking yellow your teeth are.
[68:06.39]Oh, don't do that.
[68:10.08]Don't do that.
[68:13.00]Don't do that.
[68:17.55]Don't do that.
[68:20.57]Alright, here we go.
[68:31.59]This is Bram Stoker's Dracula.
[68:36.12]I'm not doing fangs.
[68:42.03]God, I love that sound.
[68:58.93]Same company.
[69:03.11]I want to rub my eyes, but I can't because I'll get this makeup all over me.
[69:18.24]I stopped watching your SEGA CD video to watch your SEGA CD stream.
[69:23.73]Based.
[69:27.40]Alright, here we go.
[69:31.04].
[69:56.13].
[69:56.17].
[70:01.69]That pumped me up.
[70:02.43]I don't even know what that sound was.
[70:07.64]Like an industrial yard.
[70:09.86]Beware!
[70:10.32]Dracula is in your room right now.
[70:21.63]Beware.
[70:26.40]Licensed by SEGA CD.
[70:29.67]Press start to play.
[70:41.82]What the hell is going on?
[70:56.30]It's like a Reddit gif when somebody, like, when somebody is talking about, like, a new release that came out.
[71:01.51]Like, dude, Steam sale, let's go!
[71:04.15]That was a fucking reaction gif.
[71:12.63]What?
[71:20.22]The year of our Lord, 1897.
[71:24.15]Jonathan Harker takes his first brave steps on his long and perilous journey.
[71:30.64]His single purpose is to rid mortal man of this appalling creature and banish his memory from the realms of the living.
[71:39.34]Paul and Christian.
[71:44.99]What about man?
[71:53.38]Man is pretty terrible too, aren't they?
[71:57.23]Level one, Journey to Castle Dracula.
[71:59.65]Lives five, continues two.
[72:13.65]Alright, I gotta jump?
[72:14.51]Is that me?
[72:15.07]Why am I just a guy with a vest on?
[72:20.22]Dude!
[72:20.84]That's like a Tony Hawk Ollie!
[72:25.14]Oh shit!
[72:26.58]Okay, punch, kick, jump.
[72:31.29]Ugh!
[72:36.12]What the fuck was that?
[72:43.11]Oh my god, he's kicking my ass!
[72:50.06]Who am I?
[72:51.02]I'm not Dracula, right?
[73:02.98]That's just...
[73:06.60]That was a Galaga move.
[73:08.03]That was literally Galaga.
[73:09.71]That's Galaga.
[73:10.65]I'm good at Galaga, so I fucking cleared that whole line.
[73:20.02]Kick that fucking thing.
[73:21.06]I don't want that swamp guy touching me.
[73:30.81]You can't even fall.
[73:35.51]Dude, take your foot off the gas.
[73:38.17]Take your foot off the gas.
[73:41.44]You're in neutral.
[73:42.72]You're in neutral.
[73:44.36]You have to put it in drive.
[73:45.50]Put it in drive.
[73:47.39]Boy, teaching people how to drive.
[73:54.66]What the fuck?
[73:56.44]Why am I alive?
[74:01.65]Alright, there's a bear trap right there.
[74:02.81]Don't stand on it.
[74:07.83]Get off me, you pieces of shit!
[74:32.07]Nooo!
[74:36.58]Get the fuck out of here.
[74:43.43]Alright, I got... Is there a health potion?
[74:45.99]How am I supposed to get over these?
[75:03.23]Excuse me?
[75:06.96]No, you can't jump over those.
[75:13.65]Alright, I got to settle down.
[75:23.46]God damn, how many bats do you have?
[75:29.35]Oh my God, I'm going to puke.
[75:32.06]Did he hit me with every single one?
[75:44.00]I'm gonna step on a rake and it's gonna hit me in the face.
[75:47.14]It's gonna- I'm gonna step on the rake, it's gonna fly up and hit me in the face.
[75:56.97]What the fuck?
[75:58.69]Oh shit, a bridge!
[76:02.68]He's too drunk?
[76:03.84]I am- How dare you?
[76:10.98]I landed on it and he still fell down!
[76:28.31]Let's go.
[76:37.57]Why is that a little version of me?
[76:38.81]Why is that a little guy there?
[76:39.91]Why is there a little guy that's me?
[76:52.79]Dude, the CD just started skipping.
[76:57.40]Oh, shit!
[76:58.32]Okay, lightning.
[76:59.54]Lightning, get away from the lightning!
[77:06.09]What the fuck?!
[77:12.56]How am I supposed to get away from the...
[77:17.95]This game is cracked out, dude!
[77:28.47]No!
[77:30.07]Oh my god, how did I get hit by everything?
[77:35.94]Alright, get me out of here.
[77:39.24]How do I get in the buggy?
[77:41.06]How do I get in?
[77:48.67]Holy shit.
[78:05.36]Okay.
[78:17.46]I'm still going.
[78:23.19]Okay.
[78:35.33]and the Count, in one of his many guises, may drain your mortal body.
[78:43.89]Are you going to smoke that pipe, or is he just going to hold it in your mouth?
[79:06.46]I had a dream of like this.
[79:09.41]This was almost exactly my dream.
[79:11.21]Is that weird?
[79:12.81]This whole thing playing out right now, the same quality too.
[79:23.13]I'm not sure what we just witnessed, but okay.
[79:27.65]Should I turn my light off?
[79:29.36]Not yet.
[79:41.77]Wait, it's too loud!
[79:49.98]It's way too loud!
[79:54.33]Get it off me!
[79:54.77]What is it, a rat?
[79:56.19]Was it a lizard?
[79:57.07]Why are there lizards?
[79:58.74]It's a bearded dragon!
[80:01.62]Get these, they're Pikmin!
[80:02.79]They're attacking me like Pikmin!
[80:13.52]Get off me!
[80:14.08]Something's on my head!
[80:14.83]Get outta here!
[80:25.99]Get the fuck off me!
[80:31.56]Can I please go?
[80:34.58]Oh my god.
[80:40.50]How do I...
[80:46.92]I need to kick more.
[80:49.92]Get off my ankle!
[80:53.82]Ah, yes.
[80:57.91]How is our adventurer faring?
[81:00.55]Has he fought the 60 bearded dragons and the 30 spiders and the 12 cats and the guy that spits acid?
[81:11.65]My god, dude, this is...
[81:24.52]Let me turn my camera down.
[81:26.74]Oh, this one's a little intense.
[81:32.44]Alright.
[81:32.66]How's this?
[81:33.08]Ready?
[81:36.33]Better.
[81:36.59]A little more mysterious now.
[81:56.11]okay we'll keep it like this it's is it glowing dude it's glowing can you see look it's actually glowing right now that looks sick turn on the uh the black light see if it doesn't anything
[82:40.74]sorry sorry guys that looks like the top of like a fucking Red Bull fridge do you know what I mean like that's not even a black light I pulled that out of a coca-cola fridge whatever we're gonna go oh oh my god that's dog shit I don't I just got it I got it because it's a it is it is shit
[83:11.88]Can you, wait, hold on.
[83:15.30]It kind of happens if I'm over here.
[83:16.82]Hold on.
[83:18.59]The spider moved.
[83:22.64]It adds a little something.
[83:24.76]It's probably gonna explode.
[83:27.16]It's gonna explode.
[83:30.37]Can those things explode?
[83:37.41]It may have been in the garage for two years.
[83:40.17]Okay?
[83:40.47]That may have been sitting in the garage for two years.
[83:42.48]Is that bad?
[83:47.47]That shit was in the garage for like a year and a half.
[83:51.96]Is that gonna pour chemicals into the room?
[83:57.99]Whatever.
[84:07.63]I don't think it'll explode if you don't smash it well.
[84:12.56]Okay, I got two continues.
[84:13.78]I'm ready.
[84:15.77]God.
[84:17.17]This game is insane.
[84:18.33]These have been great.
[84:19.15]These have been two bangers.
[84:20.19]I love these two.
[84:22.48]This was one game.
[84:24.46]Double feature.
[84:25.20]You saw it.
[84:28.12]And so Harker, oblivious to the cruel and terrible dangers that await him there, boards the coach that is to speed him into the very heart of the Dark One's domain.
[84:40.88]But take heed, for lifeless statues are not always made of stone, and the Count, in one of his many guises, may drain your mortal body.
[84:53.37]There goes a giant chess piece next to him.
[84:57.34]I can't believe how much that thing sucks.
[85:03.28]Turn it off, it's next to the spider web, it might go up in flames.
[85:09.59]That'd be so fucked up.
[85:12.39]Imagine a guy dressed as Dracula in his room, that'll be all over the internet.
[85:17.98]Dude, did you see that clip of the guy that was dressed like Michael Jackson?
[85:21.35]Yeah, it was crazy.
[85:21.99]He was Michael Jackson for Halloween.
[85:23.43]Yeah, it's fucking crazy.
[85:25.13]He was doing like, come on and stuff.
[85:27.17]I think so.
[85:28.05]That's what somebody told me.
[85:28.96]I didn't see the whole clip.
[85:30.40]But he was doing like, come on and come on.
[85:32.30]And then he went back and the dude is rumbling on fire while he was moonwalking.
[85:37.81]Is that what happened?
[85:38.55]I don't know.
[85:39.33]Somebody told me that.
[85:44.77]...
[85:49.22]Watch the whole goddamn clip before you make a fucking assessment of the world.
[86:09.76]Dude, I heard he was fighting animals too.
[86:12.67]I don't know.
[86:13.60]Yeah, somebody told me that he was fighting animals like bats and lizards in his room.
[86:18.30]I didn't see the clip.
[86:19.52]I have no idea.
[86:20.06]Somebody said that to me.
[86:22.44]A spider.
[86:22.88]He punched a spider that came down and dropped on him.
[86:25.39]Let his room lit on fire.
[86:30.37]Oh, my God.
[86:31.07]I'm just walking through this.
[86:39.54]I got five lives.
[86:40.48]I don't even care.
[86:42.59]The game is too loud.
[86:44.56]It's too fucked up.
[86:45.84]I- I don't give a fuck.
[86:51.73]I'm gonna get through this.
[86:55.91]Oh shit, my- my singing is having trouble.
[87:07.07]Get away!
[87:09.83]What the hell?
[87:10.45]What's happening?
[87:22.81]Okay, I made it!
[87:34.34]Oh, whoa, that's 3D!
[87:36.05]They're throwing 3D books at us!
[87:41.45]Look out!
[87:49.02]Get out of the room!
[87:54.16]I wouldn't dodge any of these.
[88:04.11]Okay, that room gave me a headache.
[88:23.18]Let's go.
[88:27.22]Get the fuck off me.
[88:45.19]That's not scary.
[88:46.17]That's not scary.
[88:46.89]It's just, it's just abnormal.
[89:00.90]Oh my god.
[89:21.15]How much health do you have?
[89:30.36]Is that Dracula?
[89:33.02]No, Dracula's not green!
[89:51.31]It's hard to tell what that is.
[90:14.41]Oh shit, ghosts!
[90:23.54]Hey!
[90:45.14]Hey!
[90:45.44]Get over here!
[90:54.61]Dude, there's only one place where you can kick a spider like that that's big enough to do that, and that's Australia.
[91:11.77]You know, people, uh, people can have their, uh, you know, whatever sexual proclivities, you know?
[91:18.00]Let there be a thousand blossom sploons far as I'm concerned.
[91:22.84]But I'm not gonna spend any time on it.
[91:25.34]Because every couple of months, somebody gets torn apart by a crocodile in North Queensland.
[91:38.99]I can't even hear myself talk.
[91:40.41]Did that land?
[91:41.67]Did you guys think that was funny?
[91:42.71]I can't even hear myself think.
[91:53.60]I gotta continue.
[91:54.40]We're good.
[92:01.25]Enter the level select code.
[92:02.64]Hold on a second.
[92:05.60]You know, bless the mods.
[92:12.05]They're dropping me level select.
[92:15.82]When Beware appears on the screen, press A, left, up, C, A, right to activate cheat mode.
[92:20.79]Okay, I'll try it after this.
[92:27.32]Turn it down.
[92:29.41]It needs to be loud.
[92:30.19]It's the SEGA CD stereo audio.
[92:31.95]Did you not hear Count Dracula at the very beginning of the stream?
[92:36.68]I mean, his audio cut out because he peaked too hard, and I was trying to play screaming people.
[92:40.58]That was my fault.
[92:41.26]I fucked that up.
[92:42.04]I tried to play people screaming, and you didn't hear any of it.
[93:01.02]Play the whole thing again.
[93:02.10]Okay, I'll play the whole thing again at the end of the stream.
[93:08.09]You want to do it right now while I pee?
[93:13.27]Alright, let's play the whole thing again while I pee.
[93:15.54]Because I got to go to the bathroom anyway, so.
[93:21.93]Here is the intro, if you missed it.
[93:32.32]There's not going to be any music because I was doing the music manually.
[93:38.49]So you can hear the whole thing.
[93:42.76]So imagine there's cool Castlevania music halfway through this.
[93:46.79]I'll be right back.
[98:35.70]Oh, dear.
[98:40.16]Oh, dear.
[98:43.16]Oh.
[98:44.37]Oh.
[98:45.71]Oh.
[98:50.85]God.
[98:50.95]How many years has it been?
[98:55.80]How many years has it been?
[99:00.84]10,000, probably.
[99:03.00]It's so bright in this dark room.
[99:06.11]Igor!
[99:07.17]Igor!
[99:08.95]My servant Igor.
[99:13.42]Oh!
[99:15.13]Oh, hello!
[99:15.91]I didn't know Igor was going to set a camera up this quickly.
[99:21.32]It's a great pleasure to meet you on this great Hallow's Eve.
[99:25.75]Oh, man, I was expecting at least to get into the salon, maybe, in case they're... My name is Cal Jerkula, and I'm here to present to you, or present to the world, myself.
[99:36.76]And, of course, I planned this.
[99:39.81]They buried me 10,000 years ago, and I told them, I want you to have that casket come off when the SEGA CD comes out.
[99:48.72]I heard about it.
[99:49.46]I looked through my globe.
[99:50.62]I have one of those wizard globes.
[99:51.90]And I looked through it.
[99:52.96]And I saw this great console.
[99:54.77]Stereo sound.
[99:56.19]That's unbelievable.
[99:57.88]Stereo sound.
[99:58.76]I don't even know what that is.
[100:00.12]It's very old here.
[100:02.95]And it smells.
[100:04.99]But stereo sound.
[100:06.45]I've heard they made a game about it.
[100:19.29]Do I have children?
[100:21.78]Hold on, kids.
[100:25.78]Oh.
[100:29.24]Oops.
[100:30.70]Hold on.
[100:33.09]They made a game about me, kid.
[100:35.45]Hold on.
[100:35.77]It's Halloween.
[100:37.27]How am I not ready to be prepared for this?
[100:40.03]The cape is in here.
[100:40.95]Why would they bury me with the cape on?
[100:42.41]Igor!
[100:45.30]You curmudgeon Igor.
[100:54.92]uh I'm back by the way hi yes hello kids how are you I was gonna do kid voices that were like oh trick-or-treat and what are you for Halloween this year I'm Spider-Man Spider-Man oh look at you Spider-Man I don't know what that is but I kind of think it's better that he just is talking to no one
[101:24.35]That's too many Spider-Man.
[101:26.03]That's too many Spider-Man.
[101:28.73]Those candles are cool.
[101:29.77]They actually bleed.
[101:30.74]They build up this bright red blood.
[101:36.26]He, that's you.
[101:38.43]It's a character.
[101:41.01]Oh, you just got me angry.
[101:47.68]So you don't want any?
[101:51.35]Okay.
[101:52.25]Well, that was just somebody shooting a crossbow at the house.
[101:55.93]It's okay.
[101:56.77]I just woke up for 10,000 years.
[101:58.38]I'll get to it, though.
[102:01.34]I think it's better that this is not happening.
[102:10.97]Happy Halloween, kids!
[102:11.55]Okay.
[102:12.32]Let's go to my domain and play Dracula Unleashed for the status CD.
[102:20.27]There it is.
[102:21.91]Alright.
[102:22.17]So if you missed that earlier, uh, I guess I'm just gonna, I just played it again.
[102:28.03]How'd you make the coffin?
[102:30.20]Uh, well, uh, shout out to my mother and her two friends and Holly and me, uh, because they helped a lot.
[102:47.56]I've had that table to put it on forever.
[102:51.71]I was like, I really, I want to do a thing where I just kind of am Dracula and I come out of a coffin.
[102:57.36]I got sick last year.
[102:58.32]I got sick the year before that, but I, I, I'm ready to do it now.
[103:01.98]And I did tell you, I promised you guys that you would see the Dracula bit eventually.
[103:07.69]And I told you a few weeks ago, two weeks ago, nah, I'm not doing anything for Halloween.
[103:15.77]Hmm.
[103:15.87]Hmm.
[103:15.97]Hmm.
[103:16.07]Hmm.
[103:16.17]Hmm.
[103:20.80]And here we are.
[103:22.56]Alright, you ready?
[103:29.61]I lied.
[103:30.37]I told you I was still going to have fun when I felt like it.
[103:43.81]Here we go.
[103:44.41]Alright, where, this, right here.
[103:53.35]Why are you defacing?
[103:54.55]What's with the deface?
[103:59.46]Okay, let's do it at a reasonable audio.
[104:02.43]That's fine.
[104:02.91]Okay, here we go.
[104:10.10]Uh, I'm gonna give everybody a chance to vote here.
[104:19.64]Uh, would you rather see Dracula Unleashed, which is why I did this stream in the first place, or Time Gal?
[104:30.80]Time Gal is an FMV, uh, kind of like Dragon's Lair.
[104:36.14]It's not really Halloween related, but I do kind of want to do it.
[104:41.97]Maybe we'll do it after Dracula.
[104:43.63]Let's see what people say.
[104:46.12]Oh, my eye.
[105:09.75]I have to get to the, I gotta get to the next level.
[105:11.39]I have to.
[105:14.91]Uh, Dracula Unleashed is a full FMV adventure game.
[105:17.91]I have no idea how bad it is.
[105:19.32]It could be absolute dog shit.
[105:22.02]But we're gonna play it.
[105:27.99]Whoa!
[105:29.09]Why is the room turning around?
[105:36.34]Alright, that was pretty cool.
[105:41.10]That's cool, dude!
[105:46.67]That was cool.
[105:48.59]Dude, it's glow-in-the-dark.
[105:49.87]Do you see it?
[105:50.29]Look.
[105:57.26]I think it's gonna explode.
[106:02.63]Are those bats?
[106:06.73]Yup.
[106:07.81]Yup.
[106:12.13]I don't even... What did I just pick up?
[106:15.34]Just jump.
[106:16.02]Fuck it.
[106:16.52]Go.
[106:17.42]Fuck it.
[106:25.05]Now I'm over here fighting Spinal.
[106:31.04]Spinal!
[106:32.40]There we go.
[106:33.02]That's better.
[106:43.98]Oh shit.
[106:56.80]Ah!
[107:12.92]What level am I even on?
[107:32.93]Imagine punching a ghost once in the face and it just leaves you alone forever.
[107:54.51]Stop looking at me!
[107:57.60]You just threw my flow off so bad.
[108:23.07]I was joking with Holly earlier.
[108:25.48]This is the most formal attire I've worn in...
[108:27.92]Hold on, I can't hear myself talk.
[108:29.24]I'll tell you in a second.
[108:32.65]This is the most formal attire I've worn in probably a year or two.
[108:40.38]Weird.
[108:48.38]Please don't.
[108:49.04]Come on.
[109:11.14]This is a long ass level.
[109:20.76]I'm so fucked here.
[109:28.40]Come on, get me to the next area.
[109:30.86]Should I cheat?
[109:41.89]I feel like even Dracula would be annoyed at all the spiders in his house.
[109:52.04]Okay, we got it.
[109:59.43]Hmm?
[110:06.94]Is this Dracula?
[110:07.84]Oh, he grabbed my head!
[110:25.22]He didn't even want to talk?
[110:30.73]Oh shit, it's gonna start us over at level 2, the search for Dracula.
[110:34.56]Okay, I hear you.
[110:41.87]Okay, fuck.
[110:42.15]Alright, so I'm gonna do the level select.
[110:43.53]I think I'm gonna cheat.
[110:51.16]I'll try to skip the whole thing.
[111:04.15]Laugh my ass off dude, this game sucks.
[111:06.66]I actually think it's pretty great.
[111:08.10]Alright, what do I do?
[111:13.43]When beware is on screen, let's reset it.
[111:18.54]Okay, when beware is on screen, press A left up, C A right down.
[111:41.90]When beware is on the screen, A left up... God, I'm gonna mess this up, aren't I?
[111:54.30]Too much vodka?
[111:56.21]No, dude, I'm fine.
[111:59.35]Okay, A... A left up C A.
[112:15.05]What level was I even on?
[112:16.07]Level 2?
[112:26.78]That was level 4?
[112:30.21]Holy smokes.
[112:36.35]Alright, let's go level 3.
[112:42.36]Okay, hold on.
[112:42.80]Here it comes.
[112:46.35]Play Mr. Bones for the Saturn.
[112:49.21]I have a Saturn.
[112:51.66]Don't think you're not going to see a Saturn stream eventually here.
[112:54.94]We got SEGA CD first.
[113:06.93]Alright, here we go.
[113:09.83]A left, A left up, C, A right down.
[113:21.48]There we go.
[113:27.39]Okay, I think that- that was a- that was like a Windows 3.2 window.
[113:32.58]Okay.
[113:35.86]Hold B and press- okay, hold B and C and press Start.
[113:43.47]Did that work?
[113:45.87]This should be level 3.
[113:47.05]Ooh!
[113:58.44]From the movie Success is but a pinprick of light in a land of darkness
[114:10.78]Dracula flees the onslaught, and in an attempt to pursue, Harker enters the dungeons.
[114:18.52]Cold, dank air freezes his lungs as he prepares to face the evil...
[114:24.09]This was one of the more expensive items.
[114:25.73]I have to show it over and over again.
[114:28.40]The brides are abroad, seeking to feed on the blood of a living man.
[114:42.47]Uh, Holly did my makeup.
[114:57.25]Oh, you know, just back to kicking rats.
[115:01.95]Well, no.
[115:03.44]Well, I'm fighting scorpions.
[115:18.38]Oh my god, just kick him!
[115:35.19]Alright!
[115:48.53]Die!
[116:11.16]Oh my god.
[116:11.98]Alright, I think I'm just gonna see the ending cutscene.
[116:17.56]I think I'm done with this one.
[116:22.12]This was great though.
[116:23.15]I loved every second of it.
[116:34.76]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[116:44.76]What?
[116:47.07]They get hit by the stairs?
[116:56.59]Buyer's remorse?
[117:00.11]Buyer's remorse?
[117:00.95]No way, dude.
[117:03.12]I am so happy that I own this.
[117:04.98]I get to keep it forever.
[117:08.80]Holy shit, that was cool.
[117:12.83]Is that a landmine?
[117:15.65]Oh, no it's not.
[117:33.21]nice that was clean when we were kids me and my siblings would turn the lights off to this music and pretend that we were vampires I paraphrased the hell out of that that might not have you might have said something you might have said something completely different I added in extra sentences
[118:03.79]Alright, when my lives are all gone, we are moving on to Dracula Unleashed.
[118:19.82]That one is gonna be fried.
[118:22.76]That's the main event.
[118:25.09]Hope you're ready for it.
[118:31.44]You want to talk about a cooked game?
[118:34.01]It's that one.
[118:49.29]He's so hip.
[118:50.43]I know.
[118:52.07]I'm keeping up with the times.
[119:03.49]Dude, I would have screamed at that in 1993.
[119:17.17]Shit.
[119:24.04]Can I leave?
[119:28.81]Yep.
[119:32.02]How do you keep up with the times with your coffin?
[119:34.61]An iPad?
[119:36.54]Built into the top there was an iPad screen and it was connected to the internet.
[119:39.73]And it would just load up the front page of Reddit every day.
[119:59.36]Alright, that was Bram Stoker's Dracula and Frankenstein combo game.
[120:12.34]Pretty cool.
[120:17.46]Creature from hell.
[120:20.23]You gave up?
[120:20.93]Oh yeah, I gave up.
[120:22.17]We got, there's other stuff to do.
[120:25.37]Alright.
[120:28.07]There it is.
[120:31.04]Been sitting there this whole time.
[120:38.37]A true video production.
[120:40.83]Dracula Unleashed.
[120:50.74]I've been waiting for this one a long time.
[120:52.94]So be ready because it's probably going to be dog shit.
[120:56.67]And I'm going to be disappointed.
[120:58.81]And I'm going to say, oh wow, that's too bad.
[121:01.60]But I'm happy I own it.
[121:04.28]So let's go.
[121:07.26]Let's freaking go.
[121:09.57]We don't say the F word here.
[121:15.81]This is a multi-disk game, by the way.
[121:23.02]Oh, heckin', dude.
[121:27.11]Alright.
[121:28.61]This has been sitting here for a long time.
[121:33.98]I'm so nervous.
[121:37.03]Should I undo this now?
[121:39.09]Every, like, hour I should get more and more disheveled looking?
[121:49.98]Absolutely not?
[121:50.85]What do you mean?
[121:51.31]Why not?
[121:56.96]No?
[121:59.90]Okay.
[122:01.20]I'll keep it on.
[122:10.95]Drink something red?
[122:12.30]Bro!
[122:19.34]What do you think is in there?
[122:26.07]Stop feeding the fan cams?
[122:29.46]What are you doing?
[122:31.56]You're making a fan cam?
[122:32.52]What are you doing?
[122:35.06]What are you doing?
[122:36.96]Don't!
[122:41.33]Alright, disk one, it's in there, right?
[122:45.99]Look at how fucked up this is.
[122:49.10]Wait, was that not disk one?
[122:58.13]Oh, that was disk two.
[123:00.49]Okay.
[123:01.10]Oops.
[123:02.78]My bad.
[123:03.32]Oh, God.
[123:08.59]Can I open this?
[123:09.11]Is that alright?
[123:12.68]I think it's alright.
[123:15.65]It'll be a Halloween miracle if we get to disk two tonight.
[123:19.88]I would be shocked.
[123:25.16]This is like a 50-hour game.
[123:30.49]Like 10, but whatever.
[123:31.90]Who's counting?
[123:34.58]Okay, let's try that again.
[123:42.84]Turn it up.
[123:46.54]Viacom New Media.
[124:06.94]Please don't kill me.
[124:30.80]Dude, CD audio, that's right.
[124:53.05]Wait, Helsing's in this one, too?
[124:54.97]Oh, man.
[124:58.39]Can't wait to get stuck at the first puzzle and then rage quit the game and then turn the stream off and ruin everybody's night.
[125:48.78]168 pixels.
[125:54.06]Ah, you're not far off.
[125:54.85]It's probably like 200.
[125:55.51]And this is upscaled to 4K.
[126:05.18]I have a RetroTINK 4K.
[126:07.81]It is trying...
[126:08.71]It's damnedest right now.
[126:21.21]Alright, Mike Plant, what do you got?
[126:37.39]It's kind of creepy.
[126:39.56]What are the options?
[126:45.61]Audio on, on, on, on, on, on.
[126:50.96]I don't know what I'm turning off.
[126:53.38]I guess we're going to keep it like that.
[126:54.53]New?
[126:55.89]I wish you were here now, Quincy.
[127:10.93]You were always there for me when I needed you.
[127:13.31]Even now, it's your friends who've made me strong enough to carry out what I must do.
[127:19.36]First it was Father Janos who started me on this agonizing task.
[127:22.61]Now with the eight of your old allies, it looks like we'll end this horrible scourge.
[127:29.37]So much has happened these past few days.
[127:33.98]Flashback?
[127:36.18]Thank you.
[127:37.10]Alexander.
[127:37.94]Arthur.
[127:38.70]I can't tell you how much I appreciate your kindness while I've been in your city.
[127:41.90]And now for you to sponsor me in London's most prestigious club.
[127:44.45]Nonsense.
[127:45.21]Your brother and I were extremely close.
[127:47.45]Here, let me introduce you to some of the other members of the Hades Club.
[127:49.71]Devlin.
[127:50.79]The Hades Club.
[127:51.68]We're evil.
[127:53.08]Devlin, Alexander Morris.
[127:54.46]I believe I've mentioned his late brother, Quincy.
[127:56.32]Yes, you have.
[127:57.52]Mr. Goldacre, this certainly is a pleasure.
[128:00.07]It will be an honor to be accepted into your club.
[128:02.05]So, this is the brother of the famous Quincy Morris.
[128:05.45]Yes.
[128:05.51]I suppose even London isn't big enough for more than one Texan at a time.
[128:10.44]What brings you here?
[128:11.92]Well, it's an unusual story.
[128:13.06]Jim Carrey in an outfit?
[128:14.58]I received a letter from a Romanian priest telling me I should investigate the circumstances surrounding my brother's stabbing.
[128:19.87]Ah, your Romanian priest couldn't have directed you to a more peculiar city.
[128:24.48]And now with the murders in the newspaper... Oh, do shut up, Leopold.
[128:31.16]Never mind our Czechoslovakian drunk and his...
[128:34.61]ramblings so how long have you been in our fair city well a number of months actually I got a bit sidetracked from my investigation when I met Anna set since we became engaged and her father took ill I really haven't had the time to pursue the matter further yes well I can see how Anna set could have that effect on a man excuse me sir what a time just say a sentence and laugh for me
[129:03.75]Thank you.
[129:04.17]People don't say sentences and laugh anymore.
[129:06.05]Good lord.
[129:06.79]Why?
[129:07.09]It's a note from Mr. Bowen's doctor.
[129:10.28]Mr. Bowen has just suffered a fatal heart attack.
[129:13.08]I have sedated Miss Bowen and would appreciate your presence tomorrow morning.
[129:16.48]I'm terribly sorry.
[129:18.45]Perhaps I should go home.
[129:19.91]I could do with some rest as well.
[129:21.33]Pardon me.
[129:23.03]Music.
[129:24.17]Death is such a dreadful business.
[129:30.02]Okay.
[129:31.20]Is it a bad dream?
[129:36.84]Oh, no.
[129:38.08]No.
[129:39.02]Those people suck.
[129:40.19]Imagine having a nightmare like that.
[129:41.97]I know, but it's so hard.
[129:43.87]I miss him so.
[129:45.25]Let me call the doctor to remove his body.
[129:47.23]The sooner he's in the ground, the sooner his soul can move.
[129:50.96]You think that death can take her from me?
[129:56.52]Oh, Daddy.
[130:02.87]I said no!
[130:03.09]No!
[130:04.16]That guy was crazy looking!
[130:06.73]Okay, alright, so we had two bad dreams in a row, we woke up from one dream and there was another dream?
[130:16.62]Alright, I got options here.
[130:19.14]What is this?
[130:19.83]Leave, maybe?
[130:22.03]What is- is this like a painting?
[130:23.41]What is this?
[130:29.70]Can I draw?
[130:32.83]Okay, that's my journal.
[130:34.41]What's this?
[130:40.06]Who is this?
[130:40.74]Okay, there's a guy here.
[130:41.82]Select one.
[130:46.45]I am Dr. Abraham Van Helsing.
[130:48.83]As a teacher, it is my duty and pleasure to instruct you in the proper use of some most valuable tools.
[130:58.20]Okay, he's gonna help us.
[131:01.06]What's this?
[131:02.94]Good day.
[131:03.92]You have selected Mr. Alexander Morris, no?
[131:07.34]For the rest of this game, you and he are as one.
[131:10.99]Okay.
[131:11.11]You make the decisions that guide this worthy one, and his life, it is in your hand.
[131:17.70]Guide him well, for when you see him on the screen, it is you.
[131:22.64]I hope you're ready for adventure without compare and horror beyond measure.
[131:29.69]Okay.
[131:30.21]So what's this?
[131:32.23]Time, the most precious commodity, will never have enough.
[131:37.18]So guard what little you have.
[131:39.74]this pocket watch always available on main screen it lets you see what time it is and help you keep track of its fleeting grains okay some of you and you know who you are do not realize how valuable time is therefore use this watch to advance the time also simply select past time and watch time fly past you
[132:08.94]Okay.
[132:09.80]Get it?
[132:10.32]I got it.
[132:11.58]What's this?
[132:12.60]A wise person need to know where he has been as much as where he is going.
[132:17.93]It's a journal.
[132:18.43]For that reason, keep a close eye on your journal.
[132:22.71]Here you record your experiences, opening a new page and selecting your pen.
[132:29.68]This also allow you to save addresses and newspaper clippings, and you may access it from the main screen at any time.
[132:39.92]Don't go through all nine.
[132:41.06]How am I going to know what to do if I don't do all nine?
[132:43.61]It's Halloween.
[132:44.31]You can chill.
[132:46.43]You never know what will prove useful.
[132:49.38]Over the course of your adventures, you will come across many items.
[132:53.26]That's inventory.
[132:54.18]This icon to see everything you carry.
[132:57.47]Anytime you acquire something new, it go in the acquire box in the upper right hand corner.
[133:03.52]Okay, so what's this?
[133:05.72]The center of civilization.
[133:09.02]The jewel in Victoria's crown.
[133:11.39]There'll be many places which you can visit in this city.
[133:15.28]It is a big city, yeah?
[133:17.52]But worry not, you have maps which guide you.
[133:21.34]Simply use the icon on the main screen and you'll never be lost.
[133:25.87]But you are a busy man and wonder how much time it takes to go to these places, yeah?
[133:32.12]Simply choose two locations on the map and you will be provided with the travel time between them.
[133:38.75]Nothing could be more simple.
[133:42.00]So what's this?
[133:45.85]Whoa.
[133:47.84]What's this?
[133:58.64]A gentleman cannot be expected to walk in London.
[134:02.59]You must take carriage.
[134:04.83]There be carriages on every corner, facilitating the... Mario gives you instructions ASMR.
[134:10.79]This is a dark adventure you have embarked on, my friend.
[134:14.64]If you are wise, you will recognize how best to survive the terrors that await you.
[134:21.15]You must be careful to watch for clues.
[134:24.73]I watch for clues, and this is probably home base.
[134:48.40]Okay.
[134:51.12]To go a day in the night without sleep, my friend, would not be wise.
[134:58.33]No, it would be very bad.
[135:00.05]Got it.
[135:00.84]Alright.
[135:01.82]I think I get the gist of what's going on.
[135:04.06]So let's get out of here.
[135:04.82]Thank you, Helsing.
[135:08.57]I appreciate it.
[135:10.73]Let's close him.
[135:11.77]Okay, so here we are.
[135:15.80]I woke up from a nightmare.
[135:24.94]Where can I go from here?
[135:27.78]Alright, Paddington, Kings Cross Strand, St. Paul's.
[135:33.49]Let's go to Kensington.
[135:38.45]It seems it will take five minutes to travel within Kensington.
[135:41.70]Okay, so go.
[135:42.92]It seems it will take five minutes to travel within Kensington.
[135:52.23]Alright, let's go.
[136:01.78]We're going to Kensington.
[136:11.21]Uh, where should I go?
[136:16.54]Anisetshaun?
[136:17.68]Let's go to Anisets.
[136:21.49]I'd like to go to 10 Campton Hill.
[136:23.57]Notting Hill, please.
[136:31.07]I'm happy to say that we have finally arrived.
[136:36.76]Okay.
[136:36.88]Thank you.
[136:38.26]Good day, driver.
[136:40.13]A good day to you, sir.
[136:42.89]It's a good day.
[136:50.08]Oh, Alexander, I'm so glad you're here.
[136:52.01]Shh, it's alright.
[136:53.23]Where's the doctor?
[136:54.87]He's gone.
[136:56.33]He said it was a heart attack brought on by shock.
[136:59.92]Shock?
[137:01.32]An open window in this weather.
[137:02.76]I shall have to talk with Ms. Culpepper.
[137:07.37]Wait, that's the guy that killed me in my dream.
[137:09.11]Alexander, I'm so tired.
[137:12.54]Why do things have to go away?
[137:13.62]He just moved his arm up.
[137:15.12]Why can't all the things we love stay forever?
[137:27.05]Okay.
[137:30.05]So he's, he's dead.
[137:31.53]I went to comfort Anicet in her time of grief.
[137:38.66]Poor Andrew.
[137:39.94]I cannot forget his face.
[137:41.72]Horrible.
[137:42.78]Locked in sheer terror and white as the odd bit of cloth clutched in his hand.
[137:48.45]Okay.
[137:50.37]Should I take the cloth?
[137:52.30]He said it was odd.
[137:53.04]I guess I'm going to leave.
[137:59.36]Okay, let's go somewhere else.
[138:04.47]We're off, sir.
[138:05.35]As soon as you can tell me where you'd like to go.
[138:06.95]Okay.
[138:08.17]How about... Let's go to Homewood's home.
[138:19.03]I'd like to go to 19 St. Augustine's, Westminster.
[138:23.69]We're here, sir.
[138:32.39]Alright, look for clues, it said.
[138:38.31]Look for clues.
[138:45.06]What time is it?
[138:46.91]Okay, 820 a.m. Can I go in?
[138:55.80]That guy's weird.
[138:57.14]Arthur is busy just now.
[138:58.47]I'm sure he'll be with you in a moment.
[139:00.02]Yes.
[139:00.79]He was my carriage driver.
[139:02.60]Ah.
[139:03.79]I had sent him to deliver this package and was beginning to wonder about his late return.
[139:08.00]Well, where was this package bound, sir?
[139:10.28]To the residence of Mr. Jonathan Harker.
[139:12.64]Let's 56, Rochester, Marble Arch.
[139:15.47]Okay.
[139:15.93]Remember that address.
[139:16.59]It was a gift for his son, young Quincy.
[139:18.77]Well, thank you so much, sir.
[139:20.45]Well, I suppose this belongs to you, then.
[139:23.52]A present.
[139:25.06]Decapitation is a most horrible crime.
[139:28.34]Strange.
[139:29.28]There's no accounting for the blood loss.
[139:38.00]Did I just get a clue?
[139:42.40]Okay.
[139:43.89]Wait, can I write that down?
[139:44.71]What a grisly shock.
[139:50.11]I went to visit Arthur Holmwood only to discover that his coachman had been killed, decapitated, with complete loss of blood.
[139:57.67]I cut my visit short, but not before learning Jonathan Harker's address.
[140:00.53]Alright, we're going to Jonathan Harker's.
[140:04.88]This is where it gets real.
[140:09.84]Well, officer, as soon as you tell me where you'd like to go.
[140:12.96]Okay, more.
[140:22.57]Harker's home.
[140:24.37]Let's go.
[140:24.64]56 Rochester and Marble Arch driver.
[140:34.95]He shotgunned that dude?
[140:40.92]I arrived.
[140:41.56]Thank you.
[140:44.81]A big mosquito is sucking all your blood?
[140:48.76]No, it's not.
[140:50.72]Okay.
[140:53.97]Where's the carriage?
[140:54.73]The carriage is really on a hill.
[140:59.26]Alright.
[140:59.44]Let's go in.
[141:05.66]Those are beautiful flowers, Mrs. Harker.
[141:07.91]Oh, I thank you, Mr. Morris.
[141:09.79]I do love roses.
[141:11.61]They remind me of someone I once knew.
[141:13.31]Fragile, beautiful, and dangerous.
[141:19.56]And how are you, Mr. Morris?
[141:21.23]Oh, I'm fine, but I'm worried about my fiancée, Anicet.
[141:24.85]Her father, Andrew Bowen, just passed away.
[141:27.03]Oh, how terrible.
[141:27.96]I'm sorry to hear it.
[141:28.98]I knew Mr. Bowen from business affairs.
[141:31.53]Holy shit!
[141:37.24]Great commentary.
[141:57.99]whoa dude I'm sorry that's twisted I have some pressing matters which I must attend to but I wanted to talk business then come to my office okay that's exactly where we're going did I get his office
[142:20.81]I went to the Harkers to inform them of the bad news.
[142:23.77]I found it odd that Jonathan seemed more disturbed by the death of a stranger than that of Andrew Bone.
[142:28.86]Okay.
[142:39.63]She's riding around in a carriage all day.
[142:41.13]Where will Betsy be taking us today, sir?
[142:45.43]Okay.
[142:46.29]Harker's office.
[142:51.77]Please take me to 45 Fenchurch, St. Paul's.
[142:59.08]Alright, we're talking business with this guy.
[143:01.16]Right on time, sir.
[143:05.43]A good day to you, driver.
[143:07.05]I should save the game.
[143:07.87]Have a good day, sir.
[143:09.31]I'm going to get, like, eaten by a monster.
[143:11.31]Alright, save.
[143:16.18]Backup RAM not responding.
[143:18.08]Format.

[143:47.04]Yes, I'd like to see Mr. Harker.
[143:48.42]I'm afraid he's unavailable.
[143:49.96]If you leave your card, I will ensure he receives it.
[143:56.85]Should I pass time and wait until tomorrow?
[143:58.28]9.50 a.m. How do I make time go faster?

[146:11.54]Oh, the newsstand.
[146:15.24]I've read that as new stand.
[146:19.13]Not news stand.
[146:21.55]Holy smokes.
[146:30.56]A good day to you, driver.

[146:42.78]Alright, what is this?
[146:44.65]That paper's not for the weak-hearted today, or those who loses their heads easily.
[146:49.73]Right messy it is.
[146:51.34]That fella with his head cut off and all, his blood gone.
[146:55.86]I needs a drink, instead of Saucy Jack when this day's over.
[146:59.93]Saucy Jack?
[147:00.77]Haven't you heard of it, Gough?
[147:02.57]The best pub in the Strand.
[147:04.71]Me mouth is watering already for a mug of Rebecca's Ale.
[147:11.19]He just read that off the script.
[147:13.82]That was phonetic reading.
[147:15.80]I don't think he even knows what he said.
[147:24.53]Alright.
[147:24.89]A new place?
[147:25.88]We keep unlocking new locations to go to.
[147:29.20]This guy's accent changes every time.
[147:36.08]Okay, Saucy Jack Pub.
[147:37.91]We're just going to every location that pops up.
[147:40.99]Please take me to 20 Surrey, The Strand.
[147:43.65]This guy's taking 10-minute Ubers every five minutes.
[147:46.94]He's racking up a huge lift bill.
[147:50.04]I'm pleased to say that we have finally arrived at our destination, sir.
[147:53.73]No, disk two is not going to pop up.

[148:33.42]Right now?
[148:34.62]Oh, careful.
[148:35.34]This one, Becky, is moody.
[148:37.29]Could be the murderer.
[148:38.71]Ah, keep your mouth shut.
[148:40.47]Don't mind them.
[148:41.51]They scared.
[148:42.99]Count of all the people being killed.
[148:45.22]Real unnatural art, too.
[148:48.00]Heads cut off and the body's all dry of blood.
[148:50.59]Hey, I'd lose my head for you, Becky.
[148:52.49]Oh, come on.
[148:53.47]Strange killings they is.
[148:56.23]That woman in white been seen all over London.
[148:59.14]It's like that Bloofer lady years ago.
[149:02.18]Bloofer?
[149:02.74]What kind of name is that?
[149:03.91]Never heard the like of her since.
[149:06.19]She's a woman... By the way, lad, where's your over-the-top accent?
[149:11.32]You don't have one, do you?
[149:12.42]...a bunch of them to that bookstore in King's Cross.
[149:16.14]What's it called?
[149:17.44]Let's see.
[149:18.51]Minoggins...
[149:21.53]That guy was like crossing the street and he was in somebody else's selfie.
[149:32.31]Oh, thanks.
[149:32.84]Appreciate that.
[149:33.38]A different place for me to go.
[149:34.66]Another like $8 lift.
[149:37.22]You got it.
[149:38.33]What was it called again?
[149:39.07]I'll go there right now.
[149:43.61]I found my way to the Saucy Jack, a pub full of local gossips.
[149:47.65]The regulars were eager for an audience, and I was told of the grisly murders and the eerie blue for lady.
[149:55.40]Okay.
[149:55.60]Alright.
[149:56.14]Let's go there and see what happens there.
[150:00.93]What?
[150:01.25]Where's your fucking over the top accent, mate?
[150:04.47]I'll be taking you.
[150:07.91]Okay.
[150:08.19]Now we're going to go to the bookstore.
[150:11.32]Is that what they said?
[150:18.07]Did they say go to the bookstore?
[150:22.07]Yeah.
[150:22.71]Right?
[150:33.61]When does Dracula get unleashed?
[150:35.09]I don't know.
[150:36.73]Probably soon.
[150:39.41]There's only so much of this that we can do before we get to see him.
[150:44.86]Alright.
[150:45.52]We made it to the bookstore.
[150:48.39]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[150:50.63]I think I shall remain here, driver.
[150:52.37]Thank you.
[150:54.84]Alright.
[150:55.80]Where am I going from here?
[151:03.99]May I help you?
[151:04.93]Mr. Horner?
[151:06.13]Alexander Morris.
[151:07.87]Mr. Holmwood has sponsored me into the Hades Club.
[151:10.36]I understand your partner is also a member?
[151:12.02]Oh, yes.
[151:12.54]Devlin mentioned you.
[151:14.08]It'll be a pleasure having you in our club.
[151:18.01]What brings you to my little bookstore?
[151:19.91]This might sound a little bit strange, but I've been told you have a book about the Bloofer Lady.
[151:24.09]The Bloofer Lady?
[151:25.19]Well, as a matter of fact, I do.
[151:29.48]She would appear as a beautiful ghost-like woman with a horrible practice.
[151:34.12]She would summon children only to return them later, some on the verge of death.
[151:39.65]The children would call her Bloofer instead of Beautiful.
[151:44.60]Yes, she has a striking resemblance to some other cases I know of.
[151:48.46]I didn't even do a fake sneeze.
[151:54.41]I half-fake sneezed.
[151:56.90]I didn't even go all in.
[151:58.74]Thanks for the book.
[152:06.69]Okay, a new address.
[152:08.64]I'm gonna go there now.
[152:14.96]Well, I do believe I found the most curious bookstore in London.
[152:18.36]I've never seen such an odd collection of books.
[152:20.95]Horner certainly seems to know his business when it comes to ghastly legends.
[152:24.73]Okay.
[152:25.90]Let's go to the Hades Club.
[152:34.35]We're going to pass Dracula on the highway.
[152:36.47]Where will I be taking you?
[152:38.90]Oh.
[152:40.13]Oh, shit.
[152:41.33]You... Hey.
[152:43.49]Hades Club?
[152:44.97]Yeah.
[152:45.49]Alright.
[152:46.12]I'll see you there.
[152:49.22]Why do I have a fucked up accent?
[152:50.68]I'm supposed to be like this.
[152:52.83]This game has fucked up my brain.
[152:55.43]Uh, we're gonna go to the asylum.
[152:58.50]I'd like to go to 52 Bishop's Bridge, Paddington.
[153:07.95]Okay.
[153:10.77]Okay.
[153:21.94]Didn't he, didn't, um, what's his name there?
[153:24.09]Didn't he want me to look for clues?
[153:30.09]Whoa!
[153:38.14]Whoa, he just punched him!
[153:39.76]He just hit him!
[153:49.11]What the fuck?
[153:49.87]He just hit that guy!
[153:51.27]What did he get him with?
[153:55.08]Alright, we gotta get a recap.
[154:01.33]Okay, we gotta go back tonight.
[154:11.43]Let's wait outside until nighttime.
[154:13.73]520.
[154:15.14]535.
[154:15.52]550.
[154:17.04]What is night?
[154:19.32]Okay, it's nighttime.
[154:20.66]605.
[154:21.34]620.
[154:22.73]635.
[154:23.09]650 p.m. 7?
[154:24.95]705 p.m. 720 p.m. 735 p.m. 750.
[154:31.54]805 p.m. Alright, this is good.
[154:46.51]Is Dr. Seward available?
[154:48.18]If he's here, he's busy.
[154:50.60]I'll give him your card, if I seize him.
[154:55.83]You told me to come back at night.
[155:06.77]How late should I come back?
[155:08.13]825.
[155:09.85]840.
[155:14.29]910 p.m.
[155:15.75]He's just standing on the street reading his clock out loud.
[155:18.98]I know dude.
[155:19.70]It's weird.
[155:20.28]925 p.m 940 955 Oh shit something's going on I thought that was Dracula Alexander Alexander And I said is that you?
[155:39.31]Oh Alexander
[155:40.21]What is she doing here?
[155:41.49]She's gonna bite my neck.
[155:45.02]No!
[155:47.72]No!
[155:48.62]Um... Yeah?
[156:03.87]So now what?
[156:07.65]Wait, is that just normal?
[156:09.39]Is that our relationship?
[156:10.35]Is that what's going on?
[156:13.22]She's like, oh yeah, good to see you.
[156:14.38]I'm going to bite your neck.
[156:15.54]Is she even a vampire?
[156:16.52]Does she just do that?
[156:21.43]Okay.
[156:28.06]Because I don't seem to care.
[156:29.96]Should I write that down in my journal?
[156:35.22]What?
[156:43.03]Hey.
[156:45.44]She's going to do it again.
[156:51.36]She's going to do it again.
[157:02.34]Is that game over?
[157:03.14]Is it resetting?
[157:06.10]I'm respawning.
[157:07.34]Okay.
[157:07.56]Well, let me get in.
[157:08.18]Let me get in here.
[157:11.45]No, get out of here.
[157:12.45]No, I don't want to do it again.
[157:16.25]Okay.
[157:26.06]So get me out of here.
[157:31.03]I can't leave.
[157:37.83]What do I do?
[157:38.43]I have to reload?
[157:50.88]I get softlocked.
[157:54.65]I don't think I can go anywhere.
[157:55.85]I think I'm screwed.
[157:58.27]Restart.
[158:00.19]It was because I skipped time.
[158:02.38]Okay.
[158:03.96]Where did I save it?
[158:05.24]Oh shit.
[158:08.88]I don't think I can change time.
[158:10.22]I can't do anything.
[158:12.58]If I click anything, it does that cutscene.
[158:15.03]I can't do anything else.
[158:21.46]Hmm.
[158:24.92]I can't pass time.
[158:26.26]I think I'm in trouble.
[158:29.29]Uh...
[158:31.46]Is this the duck?
[158:35.46]The scientist duck from Disney?
[158:45.33]Okay, so I'm gonna get respawned.
[159:06.20]Okay.
[159:07.26]You have died.
[159:08.23]What do you want to do?
[159:10.93]Shit.
[159:12.69]Well, I didn't...
[159:14.42]I passed too much time.
[159:17.16]Okay, let's speedrun this.
[159:25.15]Okay.
[159:26.42]No, we're going to go somewhere else.
[159:34.08]I got to save it.
[159:34.92]There's a lot of death screens, apparently.
[159:44.73]Okay.
[159:45.11]On where can I take you today, sir?
[159:47.42]That sounds like somebody mocking a British accent.
[159:52.42]The office, right?
[159:53.62]No.
[159:55.95]Newsstand.
[160:00.23]Are you wine drunk?
[160:02.11]No.
[160:02.97]Just regular drunk.
[160:08.62]Please take me to 98 Rutherford, Westminster.
[160:17.91]Here we are, sir.
[160:19.13]Siphon sound.
[160:23.56]Okay.
[160:23.68]Let's speedrun this.
[160:25.64]A good day to you, sir.
[160:30.42]I'm going to skip the cutscenes.
[160:31.20]We're not going to watch them.
[160:33.90]That paper's not foul.
[160:37.03]I have to remember where we went, though.
[160:43.59]I guess whatever's new in the buggy.
[160:49.63]Good day, sir.
[160:50.71]When might I be taking you?
[160:55.00]Okay, telegraph office.
[160:56.82]Maybe I should just change it up.
[160:59.66]Alright, Saucy Jack Pub.
[161:03.75]Please take me to 20 Surrey, The Strand.
[161:09.95]Okay.
[161:10.07]A good day to you, driver.
[161:11.59]I'm going to save it right here.
[161:12.67]Good day, sir.
[161:21.12]I wonder how many, um, kind of failure spots there are.
[161:25.82]Seems kind of cool.
[161:34.63]Okay, we did this.
[161:36.86]They tell us to go to the asylum?
[161:41.88]Dracula 1 sounds like a vanity plate.
[161:45.77]It does.
[161:49.55]I found my way to the Saucy Jack, a pub full of local gossips.
[161:53.62]The regulars were eager for an audience and I was told of the grisly murders and the eerie blue for lady.
[161:59.89]Now we go to the, what, the library, where the hell it is?
[162:02.79]The bookstore.
[162:05.94]I can't believe I got a softlock death sequence already.
[162:14.61]Where will Betsy here be taking us today, sir?
[162:19.18]Mm-hmm.
[162:23.65]Please take me to 12 Oldbury, King's Cross.
[162:33.07]Hey, when's the stream gonna end?
[162:34.69]I want to go home.
[162:35.33]I'm cold and tired in the coffin.
[162:38.41]So get out of the coffin!
[162:42.10]Good day, driver.
[162:43.78]And a good day to you, sir.
[162:49.19]Okay, now we go to the asylum.
[162:50.51]Alright, now I got to save it after this.
[162:59.24]And he says, come back later, but we're not going to do that.
[163:05.43]Save it right there.
[163:11.52]Alright, we're good.
[163:20.76]And what part of our beautiful city would you like to see today, sir?
[163:27.83]Maybe I shouldn't go to the asylum.
[163:28.87]He's not there.
[163:29.47]What about we just go to Hades Club?
[163:33.02]Alright, Hades Club.
[163:33.70]Let's go.
[163:35.88]What am I drinking?
[163:36.72]This is vodka cranberry in here.
[163:38.51]And I refilled it three times.
[163:44.61]I do one shot of vodka and then I fill it up with cranberry sauce.
[163:48.00]I'm happy to say that we've finally arrived.
[163:52.28]I'm just drinking like a turkey fucking dinner.
[163:57.29]Yeah, what I do is I put mayo, I put turkey in there, I put, you know, stuffing, and I just suck it up.
[164:03.08]And a shot of vodka.
[164:04.96]It's called the fucking gobbler special.
[164:09.15]Good day, driver.
[164:10.83]Good day, sir.
[164:13.89]Okay.
[164:14.90]New content.
[164:15.72]Save game.
[164:25.78]Here we go.
[164:31.23]Morris, isn't it?
[164:33.21]Mr. Goldacre.
[164:34.90]Indulge my curiosity.
[164:37.48]Why has Arthur sponsored you into our distinguished club?
[164:40.97]What in the world makes you think you belong?
[164:43.43]A gift, really.
[164:44.57]Because of his friendship with my brother.
[164:47.08]Do you know how old this club is?
[164:49.10]Arthur tells me that it dates to the turn of the century.
[164:51.40]He's wrong.
[164:52.83]Don't bite my neck.
[164:56.30]I thought he was gonna go for the bite.
[165:22.38]Alright, so what did I learn in here?
[165:25.36]I was amazed to discover what a rude bore Devlin Goldacre really is.
[165:29.41]He's quite unhappy with my membership in his club, and told me so in no uncertain terms.
[165:44.79]Spiderwebs back here.
[165:46.83]They're crazy.
[165:48.84]Alright, so where do I go?
[165:49.72]I don't want to get bit by the lady!
[165:57.82]Good day, sir.
[165:59.08]Where will I be taking you?
[166:01.26]You're sneezing with all the flour on your face?
[166:12.88]This is how I look, man.
[166:19.73]Alright.
[166:20.09]Telegraph office.
[166:20.75]Let's go.
[166:21.05]23 Luxboro and King's Cross driver.
[166:31.65]Flower.
[166:35.90]Okay.
[166:36.26]Uh, let's go.
[166:43.91]I haven't found any items.
[166:44.83]I have an inventory.
[166:49.52]There's no items.
[166:54.09]Okay.
[167:02.77]So where do I go?
[167:05.29]Do I have to go to the asylum?
[167:07.37]And I just kind of had a bad time?
[167:23.92]Let me see what Mod Chat has to say.
[167:31.57]...
[167:34.76]Back to the asylum, apparently.
[167:36.79]Okay.
[167:42.79]We're off, sir.
[167:43.76]As soon as you tell me where you'd like to go.
[167:45.40]We have a guide in chat here.
[167:48.38]Oh, hell yeah.
[167:52.71]Well, I'm not going to follow it.
[167:53.93]No, don't go to the bookstore.
[167:55.03]Okay, we're good.
[167:56.80]I'd like to go to 52 Bishop's Bridge.
[167:58.70]Do this look every day.
[168:00.25]How about once ever?
[168:03.83]One time a year.
[168:06.23]Better bundle your coat, sir.
[168:07.83]We're here.
[168:13.20]He said his asshole was really sore from spinning all this web?
[168:18.00]What did you say?
[168:18.57]I gotta see what the fuck you just wrote.
[168:31.94]Okay, well that's what you said.
[168:37.87]Give that guy a 10,000 year ban, please.
[168:47.29]Okay.
[168:47.83]Is this the right spot?
[168:51.60]I'm going to save it right here.
[169:02.70]And?
[169:03.08]No, he's gonna hit the guy with the fucking mallet!
[169:16.28]Alright, but so now where do I go?
[169:29.63]Bro thought the vampire was an arachnomancer.
[169:38.23]Is an arachnomancer a thing?
[169:42.62]What is an arachnomancer?
[169:47.21]That sounds like a Darkest Dungeon enemy.
[169:49.71]That's not a real thing.
[169:54.88]Bro thought he was dealing with an arachnomancer.
[169:57.88]He was just dealing with a weird guy that put fucking face paint on.
[170:02.12]Alright, where do I go?
[170:10.13]Go to Homewoods and get the present.
[170:12.01]Alert.
[170:14.57]Should I save it?
[170:20.48]Where can I take you today, sir?
[170:25.12]Guys, what the f... Was there a bug in this room?
[170:40.05]I'd like to go to 19 St. Augustine's, Westminster.
[170:42.62]This stuff is actually, this stuff's fun to play with.
[170:49.49]Better bundle your coats, sir.
[170:51.11]We're here.
[170:53.40]Oh shit, okay.
[170:55.66]Alright, go get the present.
[171:04.80]Present, here it comes.
[171:07.67]Maybe.
[171:08.72]Oh, I'm sorry.
[171:09.86]Arthur isn't here.
[171:10.80]He's at a meeting with Mr. Stransikowski, a fellow member of the club.
[171:14.41]Yes, I've met Mr. Stransikowski.
[171:16.33]He's a rather odd man.
[171:17.47]But it is so sad.
[171:19.85]Where is he?
[171:20.57]He was such a gifted composer before the death of his wife, Ileana.
[171:24.70]It was a carriage accident in Europe at a place called Borgo Pass.
[171:29.24]She was buried in London where her family rests.
[171:31.71]She must have been very beautiful.
[171:33.23]Oh, yes.
[171:34.57]although I never met her and the ceremony was closed casket well if you'll excuse me I must deliver this present to the harkers well I'd be glad to do that for you Mrs. homewood oh I thank you but call me regina please don't fight me I don't want to get bit okay deliver the where do I deliver it to should I go look at where that carriage is maybe the carriage is still there
[172:16.59]Aren't I at the Harker's home?
[172:17.79]And what part of our beautiful city would you like to see today, sir?
[172:22.70]Okay, home.
[172:26.18]Let's go to the Harker's home.
[172:29.63]Wait, I want to see, is that thing, is it there?
[172:31.45]No, it's not, damn it.
[172:33.31]Okay, Harker's home.

[172:36.12]56 Rochester and Marble Arch driver.
[172:44.64]Here we are, sir.
[172:45.57]Safe and sound.
[172:48.35]Okay.
[172:50.34]Should I have saved it?
[173:07.56]No!
[173:15.69]Don't look in the camera like you're pissed, like you're in the office.
[173:19.60]Is that thing going to explode?
[173:22.58]Should I wait?
[173:22.98]4.55.
[173:29.83]5.10 p.m. 5.25.
[173:33.76]5.40 p.m. Harper's...
[173:39.65]He's talking in my ear and I can't speak.
[173:42.50]Harker's office, not his home, okay?
[173:45.36]Harker's...
[173:49.17]This is why I can't ever wear two headphones.
[173:51.45]It just messes up my entire equilibrium.
[174:03.77]High Count Twinkula.
[174:06.13]No, I am...
[174:08.57]I'm a man!
[174:13.18]10,000 year ban, by the way.
[174:35.47]He's so manly.
[174:43.41]Right on time, sir.
[174:47.67]That's a man-sized band.
[174:49.29]Yeah.
[174:51.92]Good day, driver.
[174:53.60]Good night, sir.
[174:57.02]Nightmare blunt rotation.
[174:58.31]Got it.
[174:59.47]Scooby-Doo the dog.
[175:02.75]Captain Crunch.
[175:06.96]Abraham Lincoln.
[175:13.36]Jason Alexander.
[175:36.30]Gotta be a fifth one.
[175:39.99]That talking fucking candle from Beauty and the Beast.
[175:49.26]Whatever, I don't know his name.
[175:51.48]Monolith?
[175:52.19]What's his name?
[175:56.87]Look here.
[176:00.94]Alright, where do I go?
[176:02.28]Fuck.
[176:04.36]It's a monolith.
[176:06.72]Alright.
[176:07.34]Where do I go?
[176:08.00]Where do I go?
[176:09.64]Somebody has to guide me.
[176:10.83]I've had 12 fucking vodka blood pineapples.
[176:15.87]He's chill?
[176:16.79]That's why it's a nightmare.
[176:21.46]In here?
[176:21.84]Let's deliver the present.
[176:26.65]As regards our previous agreement, Mr. Morris, how can I help you?
[176:32.00]Well, I've come on personal business, sir.
[176:34.21]I feel a bit foolish, really.
[176:35.57]I don't know where to begin.
[176:36.33]Well, there are so many strange things that have happened as a... Give the present!
[176:40.22]Well, I have so many questions... Well, Mr. Morris, I appreciate that you... You look like a CG Barbie movie villain!
[176:46.57]And I'm quite busy.
[176:48.11]Good day.
[176:52.02]What the hell?
[176:57.62]I want to give the present.
[176:58.71]Why can't I...
[177:00.48]Uh, backseat Andy, you didn't get it right.
[177:03.31]I want to speak to Jonathan.
[177:04.51]We're not here.
[177:05.13]You seem far more interested in his dictaphone than answering my questions about Quincy.
[177:09.59]Far more interested in his dickphone?
[177:11.72]What is a dickphone?
[177:13.20]His dictaphone?
[177:21.17]Okay.
[177:25.60]Alert, alert, alert.
[177:26.56]Go visit your girlfriend.
[177:27.56]Alert, alert, alert.
[177:36.68]Go to Harker's office.
[177:37.82]Oh my god, I'm so fucked.
[177:39.62]Office.
[177:40.10]Alert.
[177:41.20]Okay, now go visit girlfriend.
[177:42.65]Alert.
[177:42.91]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[177:46.07]She's gonna bite me.
[177:54.00]Or do we save her from getting bit?
[177:56.36]Is that what happens?
[177:57.50]Let's find out.
[178:02.31]They are frantic.
[178:03.13]Where will we be going tonight, sir?
[178:06.40]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[178:08.42]You need the present on hand to get item from Harker.
[178:12.28]Alert.
[178:14.36]Don't I have it?
[178:18.01]Perhaps I won't be using the carriage today.
[178:23.55]Whoa, I got a lot of shit.
[178:31.52]Okay, I got the present right here.
[178:39.52]I'm gonna save it.
[178:43.67]Okay.
[178:45.23]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[178:46.47]I'm gonna go visit the girlfriend.
[178:49.03]Let's go.
[178:52.22]Why are pretzels so awesome?
[178:54.18]It's one of the best snacks on Earth.
[178:57.40]Genuinely on Earth.
[179:03.93]Second favorite Halloween candy?
[179:07.14]Well, I mean...
[179:11.41]Probably Kit Kat.
[179:18.30]I'd say Kit Kat is probably second best.
[179:21.87]I kind of like... You know what I like?
[179:25.97]I like Mr. Goodbar.
[179:28.11]Does that make me a weird guy?
[179:30.47]Mr. Goodbar is awesome.
[179:39.30]Okay.
[179:40.47]troubled head upon my loving breast.
[179:47.83]Tomorrow brings the sun again, but now it is time to rest.
[179:59.69]A lovely song.
[180:04.92]She's going to bite my neck.
[180:29.01]She just bit me.
[180:32.21]Juliet just stopped by to try and cheer me up.
[180:34.83]She's offered to spend the night here.
[180:36.89]Always a pleasure to see you, Miss Adams.
[180:39.34]If anyone can make Anisette feel better, it's you.
[180:42.94]You know, it's strange.
[180:44.98]I hate to say it, but last night I had a dream about your father passing away.
[180:51.79]He was lying there, as peaceful as can be.
[180:55.02]He seemed to look up, and there was a woman...
[180:58.59]Somebody said it looks like ASCII art.
[181:05.69]It's so low quality.
[181:08.04]What's wrong with this person?
[181:15.22]It's like Game Boy Color.
[181:20.21]This one doesn't look bad, honestly.
[181:24.96]It looks pretty good.
[181:27.38]Even this cloth reminds me of my dream.
[181:34.75]May all of us go as peacefully.
[181:38.01]It's just too bad that I got such a nicer fit than she does.
[181:40.80]She's pissed.
[181:43.60]Look at that.
[181:44.57]Look at how fucking better my fit is.
[181:46.13]Okay, so I have to have the present in my hand.
[181:55.05]They said whatever that means.
[181:56.51]Okay, well, whatever that means, dude, what are you going to do?
[181:58.72]We'll be going tonight, sir.
[182:00.48]Go to the office with a present in your hand.
[182:08.03]I'm burning so much time.
[182:09.05]Please take me to 45 Fenchurch, St. Paul's.
[182:18.48]We're here, sir.
[182:22.76]How do I put the present in my hand?
[182:24.71]Oh, shit.
[182:27.75]Bad.
[182:28.42]Very bad.
[182:30.74]No!
[182:34.80]When did I last save it?
[182:55.36]I need to do multiple saves.
[183:00.29]Where is this?
[183:00.83]Oh, fuck.
[183:15.95]Wait.
[183:22.44]God, I'm just burping so much.
[183:26.73]I can't get away.
[183:29.38]These are big ones.
[183:34.12]Alright.
[183:34.36]That's in my hand.
[183:35.56]That was repulsive.
[183:37.89]Relax.
[183:40.95]Am I at Harker's place?
[183:46.57]Good evening, sir.
[183:47.74]Shit.
[183:48.06]Where can old Nelly take you tonight?
[183:49.64]This is bad.
[183:52.34]Harker's office.
[183:53.38]Come on.
[183:53.72]I got it in my hand.
[183:55.78]Please take me to 45 Fen Church, St. Paul's.
[183:58.62]Or could I go home and sleep?
[183:59.88]Where you want to go is where we all know.
[184:01.62]Dude, you're rancid.
[184:02.56]Yeah, whatever, you know, shove it up.
[184:07.61]No.
[184:09.01]No.

[184:41.89]Good evening, sir.
[184:43.21]Where can old Nelly take you tonight?
[184:48.06]What did he say here?
[184:49.00]Please take me to 45 Fenchurch, St. Paul's.
[184:52.76]What do you mean, sir?

[187:26.00]Alright, quick, write it down.
[187:27.48]Writing dreams down is so hard.
[187:31.20]Nightmares like the one I had last night have unfortunately become all too common as of late.
[187:37.59]Dude, I had a crazy dream, and I wanted to tell chat so bad.
[187:43.47]It was crazy.
[187:49.96]I can't remember any of it, though.

[197:22.67]Alright, let's go.
[197:30.76]Those are beautiful flowers, Mrs. Harker.
[197:32.90]Oh, I thank you, Mr. Morris.
[197:34.67]Well, I do love roses.
[197:36.27]They look like worm tongue.
[197:37.03]They remind me of someone I once knew.
[197:38.31]Fragile, beautiful...
[197:41.52]And dangerous.
[197:44.52]And how are you, Mr. Morris?
[197:46.18]Well, I'm fine, but I'm worried about my fiancée, Anicet.
[197:49.81]Her father, Andrew Bowen, just passed away.
[197:51.97]Oh, how terrible.
[197:52.89]I'm sorry to hear it.
[197:53.83]I knew Mr. Bowen from business affairs.
[197:56.53]Poor Anicet.
[197:57.63]I should tell her you send your condolences.
[197:59.76]But I'm afraid that's not all.
[198:01.58]The Homewoods carriage man has been, well, murdered.
[198:05.90]He was on his way to deliver a present to little Quincy, who was found decapitated, his body drained of blood.
[198:11.56]It's horrible.
[198:13.90]Mina, have you looked in on Quincy?
[198:16.74]Not for a while now.
[198:17.96]Perhaps you should.
[198:19.99]Alright.

[208:38.03]Yes!
[208:41.79]Mr. Morris, how can I help you?
[208:44.51]I'm delivering this for the Homewoods.
[208:46.59]It was the gift that Coachman was taking to Quincy before he...
[208:49.40]Yes, well, thank you very much.
[208:54.59]I've come on personal business as well.
[208:57.59]I feel a bit foolish, really.
[208:58.83]I don't know where to begin.
[209:00.37]So many strange things that have happened, and, well, I have so many questions concerning...
[209:05.14]Yes, well...
[209:05.89]I appreciate that you think I can help, Mr. Morris, but this is my business office, and I'm quite busy.
[209:12.09]I see.
[209:12.53]What the hell?
[209:13.17]I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
[209:15.83]Open the present.
[209:16.58]Let's see what's in it.
[209:18.06]Mr. Morris, please, I don't wish to appear careless.
[209:22.90]Here.
[209:25.34]Take this.
[209:27.27]A friend of mine gave this to Mina during troubled times.
[209:30.51]She would like Anicet to have it to comfort her.
[209:35.18]Bring this to girlfriend.
[209:38.87]Okay, in hand?
[209:42.65]In hand, right?
[209:45.26]Let's find out.
[209:49.76]Okay, in my hand.
[209:51.07]Bring, save it.
[209:56.00]I gotta pee so bad.
[210:00.32]Dracula 8.
[210:08.31]Okay, back to girlfriend's house, which is back here.
[210:14.04]There we go.
[210:18.91]Alright, progress.
[210:25.54]So what happens now?
[210:34.06]Come lay your weary troubled head upon my loving breast.
[210:44.42]Tomorrow brings the sun again, but now it is time to rest.
[210:56.42]I wonder if we give it to her.
[211:19.21]I'll pee and come back after this.
[211:25.73]Come sit by me, Alexander.
[211:28.77]Juliet just stopped by to try and cheer me up.
[211:31.42]She's offered to spend the night here.
[211:33.46]Always a pleasure to see you, Miss Adams.
[211:35.93]If anyone can make Anisette feel better, it's you.
[211:39.27]The Harkers have also been generous.
[211:41.66]Media wanted you to have this necklace.
[211:43.20]There we go.
[211:43.82]Jonathan said that it had been given to them during a time of loss as well.
[211:48.53]Good.
[211:48.79]It was so strange.
[211:54.19]Okay.
[211:58.98]So we're good.
[212:05.01]We saw this.
[212:18.63]Okay, we already did that.
[212:20.87]So now I'm going to go home.
[212:25.94]Save it.
[212:27.30]Go home.
[212:28.70]And then pee.
[212:30.80]In real life.
[212:36.19]Dracula 7.
[212:44.76]Are you Team Edward or Team Jacob?
[212:46.46]Where can Oneli take you tonight?
[212:48.70]Team me.
[212:53.43]Please take me to 45 Holland, Notting Hill.
[212:59.64]Okay, I should be able to... Now I won't get that ending cutscene, right?
[213:04.27]I think that should be good.
[213:06.23]Thank you, driver.
[213:07.95]Good night, sir.
[213:09.30]Good night.
[213:12.62]Okay.
[213:18.96]We good?
[213:21.20]Can I actually sleep through the night?
[213:24.31]Collect the knife at your home.
[213:25.95]Where's the knife?
[213:27.33]I'm home right now.
[213:30.19]Where is it?
[213:33.96]Collect the knife.
[213:44.23]Okay.
[213:51.51]Where do I get the knife?
[213:56.94]Is it in the house somewhere, like over here?
[213:59.28]I don't see it here.
[214:01.74]Where is it?
[214:08.07]It's in a drawer?
[214:10.07]I don't see it.
[214:10.65]I'm going to save it right here, and then I'm going to pee, and we'll come back.
[214:13.94]Dracula 8.
[214:14.36]Alright, I'll be right back, peeing.
[214:19.18]Maybe like three or four minutes.
[214:21.95]And we'll continue for like another half an hour.
[214:25.71]BRB.
[214:29.87]See you soon.
[219:29.38]Okay.
[219:30.08]Hello.
[219:34.25]Alright.
[219:34.79]Let's get to the end of this arc and then we are going to say goodbye.
[219:42.74]People keep showing up.
[219:43.90]They say that you saw, they saw your Dracula fit on social media and came to see if it was real.
[219:53.59]Hey, we've had that fake one floating around.
[219:55.51]It's currently the Discord banner.
[219:59.84]Yeah, I think the real one was way better.
[220:03.71]I think that fit was way better.
[220:11.89]The way you read messages is like a game of Mad Libs.
[220:14.95]You replace or exclude random words until the original message is completely different.
[220:21.17]Yeah, well, I mean, I got a game in front of me.
[220:23.52]I got a camera on me.
[220:25.28]I got 10,000 people telling me to fucking spin webs out of my asshole.
[220:31.95]Yeah, I might add an extra word or two, okay?
[220:34.49]I'm doing my best, gosh darn it.
[220:43.82]Alright, let's see how this ends.
[220:46.15]And I'll save it.
[220:48.27]And we will probably say goodnight.
[220:51.06]Had a lot of fun.
[220:53.24]I'm glad I actually got to do this bit that I've wanted to do for like two years, so.
[220:59.63]Happy Halloween, everybody.
[221:00.97]Hope you had a good one.
[221:02.87]Let's see how this ends.
[221:06.06]If I could get it back over here, that'd be great.
[221:08.94]Hello.
[221:12.08]Okay.
[221:13.74]Get knife.
[221:15.99]I was told you can get your telegrams or something, or telegraphs, whatever.
[221:21.91]Right here?
[221:25.71]Read Telegram at home after 9 p.m. What time is it right now?
[221:30.54]Oh, okay.
[221:38.07]Okay.
[221:38.51]9.20.
[221:39.55]So now I can read this.
[221:41.66]Oh, shit.
[221:44.04]Let's read it.
[221:59.42]Mr. Alexander Morris, the evil awakens.
[222:02.56]Beware the night.
[222:03.94]Nothing is safe.
[222:05.93]If you respect your dead brother's memory, send me your findings.
[222:09.21]Vince's friends can verify my claims.
[222:11.53]Father Janusz Kurczany.
[222:22.03]Dude, we're gonna pick this back up.
[222:26.47]Save it right here.
[222:29.69]I finally am able to attack.
[222:31.11]100% yes.
[222:41.49]Save.
[222:44.03]Alright, I'm probably going to call it here.
[222:45.79]I'm getting kind of tired and I know it's like 3 o'clock in the morning for everybody.
[222:52.56]Right at Dracula 1.
[222:53.82]Save it right there.
[222:59.05]The next SEGA CD night, we're picking up with this right here.
[223:07.04]Where's Dracula?
[223:08.25]Oh, don't worry.
[223:08.93]You'll see him.
[223:10.45]We got a whole nother disk of this game.
[223:18.30]I'm very intrigued.
[223:22.02]Alright, guys.
[223:23.30]Have a great night.
[223:24.35]Happy Halloween.
[223:26.95]This whole stream was to get in this costume, so...
[223:33.83]I don't know what you did tonight.
[223:34.96]Maybe you did something last night.
[223:36.46]Maybe you're doing something tomorrow.
[223:38.68]Weekend is coming up here.
[223:40.68]So, have a great one.
[223:44.56]Thanks for sticking around.
[223:45.38]Happy Halloween, everybody.
[223:53.55]I'll give you...
[223:54.21]Okay, one more wide shot.
[223:57.39]There you go.
[223:58.83]I'll sit up.
[224:03.04]Oh.
[224:05.06]He's putting his makeup on.
[224:07.22]Here.
[224:07.72]There you go.
[224:17.26]It actually is glowing.
[224:18.42]It actually does look pretty good.
[224:19.86]I'll tell you.
[224:21.46]Did you see the two people taking a shit right here?
[224:23.53]I didn't even talk about this.
[224:24.73]Did I?
[224:27.90]This is a skeleton taking a shit using a laptop.
[224:32.17]Isn't that cool?
[224:35.93]Alright.
[224:36.43]I'll see you tomorrow.
[224:40.94]I will not be live tomorrow.
[224:42.48]I'm not going to be live for like weeks.
[224:48.51]Sorry, I just baited you so bad right there.
[224:50.39]I'm not going to be live for like a week or two, at least.
[224:57.38]That was mean.
[224:58.24]I'm sorry.
[224:58.66]It just slipped out.
[225:03.55]I spit all over the microphone.
[225:04.91]Don't clip that.
[225:09.76]Alright.
[225:10.24]See you later.
[225:10.96]Thanks for watching.
[225:13.28]I'll keep an eye on the sauce to see in a couple of weeks.
[225:17.13]Maybe like 10 days, 14 days.
[225:21.69]Keep an eye on the sauce.
[225:24.05]Happy Halloween.
[225:25.34]Have a great night.
[225:26.66]Good night.
[225:30.51]We'll pick this back up in a few weeks.
[225:35.87]There's a lot of other games I want to play.
[225:42.08]Take care of yourselves.
[225:43.90]Call your mother.
[225:47.83]I'm going to go take a shower and get this all off of me.
[225:57.22]I kind of like how the room is, though.
[226:01.09]Maybe I'll leave this up like a week or two.
[226:06.69]The games are kind of cracked.
[226:07.91]The Dracula game was awesome.
[226:09.46]The Frankenstein game was awesome.
[226:12.06]This one, I think we just barely got going.
[226:15.10]So we're going to give it some more time.
[226:20.29]Take care.
[226:20.93]Good night.
[226:22.65]And goodbye for now.
