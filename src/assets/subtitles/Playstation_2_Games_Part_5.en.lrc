[00:01.66]Hey.
[00:03.96]Hey.
[00:04.20]Hey, everybody.
[00:05.84]What?
[00:06.30]Oh, this is crazy.
[00:07.38]Hold on.
[00:09.54]I just saw you, like, earlier today.
[00:13.06]Did I see you earlier?
[00:14.10]We run into each other earlier today?
[00:18.09]That's weird.
[00:18.75]The same day.
[00:19.41]I didn't know you shopped at this grocery store.
[00:23.07]I just saw you at the gas station.
[00:25.17]Earlier today.
[00:27.79]God, I would say, how are you?
[00:29.05]But we already talked about that.
[00:35.17]Hey, welcome back, everybody.
[00:42.26]It's true, I saw Jerma at the gas station and he went like, gas, gas, gas.
[00:47.62]Hi, guys.
[00:49.56]Today, we're going to continue the trend that we've had the last three days.
[00:56.02]Somebody just wrote, please tell me you're going to play Muppets Party Cruise.
[01:01.30]I don't have that.
[01:03.54]I'm really sorry to tell you I do not have Muppets Party Cruise.
[01:14.34]It's not like I put it in the title.
[01:15.88]Sometimes we forget about this.
[01:18.30]There were four thousand PS2 games.
[01:23.42]I'm never gonna play them all.
[01:26.22]All I can do is just get through ones I remember and ones that look interesting.
[01:33.53]Why not?
[01:34.07]He's lying.
[01:36.23]Not with that attitude.
[01:43.18]Not with that attitude.
[01:45.62]No.
[01:47.02]And I don't just want to... Okay, the same thing happened with the VR stuff, right?
[01:50.20]Like, I really want to play a bunch of these and give them the time that they deserve.
[01:55.85]That's why we're going back and forth.
[01:58.13]Because there's a shitload more VR stuff I want to do.
[02:00.01]We've got to take a break.
[02:01.47]We're getting ping-ponged between VR and old console stuff.
[02:07.04]He's back.
[02:08.12]He knew my stream was turning on.
[02:10.08]So he just drove his car by.
[02:11.42]Again.
[02:11.62]Hey, didn't I see you earlier today?
[02:15.04]I thought I saw you earlier today at the gas station?
[02:18.95]He's back.
[02:20.81]I swear to God, I live in a fucking video game simulation.
[02:25.73]Are you guys real?
[02:27.68]Anybody here real?
[02:33.77]No.
[02:34.69]No, no, no.
[02:36.87]I think a lot of us... No, has ever anybody even asked the question to a bot like that?
[02:41.99]Are you real?
[02:42.83]Like on Twitch?
[02:44.95]They have to answer correctly, right?
[02:48.49]AI has to give the correct answer.
[02:52.20]That's actually kind of scary.
[02:55.77]Anyways, just letting people trickle in while we hang out for a minute.
[03:00.01]Oops, that's a bunch of discs.
[03:04.57]But yeah, we're gonna go back to VR after obviously this weekend was PlayStation 2.
[03:10.07]And I did see quite a few people a little bit angry with me for good reason.
[03:14.67]Because I did say yesterday that I was gonna play, hey guys, start with Clock Tower 3 and we're gonna play a bunch of other shit.
[03:23.75]And then I played Clock Tower 3 for 9 hours and beat the whole game in one sitting.
[03:28.72]I had a great time.
[03:30.14]I thought it was a fun stream.
[03:32.26]Hey, that just means we get to do it again.
[03:33.90]You know what I'm saying?
[03:36.82]I thought that was a lot of fun.
[03:39.90]So speaking of fun, I'm not sure what to start with today because there's a chance that I might just get locked into one of these.
[03:46.74]I'm thinking we start with...
[03:52.53]It's tough, I don't know.
[03:54.07]I don't want the same thing to happen.
[03:57.59]The same thing's gonna happen.
[03:58.75]Should we start off with Stuntman?
[04:04.72]I can't get stuck in Stuntman.
[04:06.30]That's not possible.
[04:09.04]I also have Stuntman Ignition, but I can't play that one first.
[04:16.57]Which one of them is better?
[04:26.43]Stuntman Ignition is so good.
[04:29.07]No, but don't get me stuck here.
[04:34.81]Ignition is better.
[04:35.75]Alright, well, let's get a taste of the good one.
[04:39.77]Don't let me get stuck here.
[04:40.83]I will.
[04:43.19]Where's Metal Gear Solid 3?
[04:44.03]Actually, I was talking to Etalyx about that the other day.
[04:48.44]About how that was my favorite Metal Gear game.
[04:54.25]Okay, here we go.
[04:54.97]We're gonna play Stuntman Ignition.
[05:00.76]I would laugh my ass off.
[05:04.88]If this turns into a Stuntman Ignition, like, six and a half hour stream.
[05:16.21]It's not gonna happen.
[05:20.44]No, I have to play... I got 25 to life here that has to come up next.
[05:27.84]But I might get lost in that.
[05:29.28]Look, it's alright, even if I get lost in them.
[05:30.77]I got PsyOps, Freedom Fighters... These are all classics.
[05:42.93]This is made by THQ, one of the old glorious companies.
[05:50.54]Paradigm Entertainment, let's go.
[05:55.86]Black screen, it shouldn't be a black screen.
[06:05.34]Pretty good Spike TV intro we got going here.
[06:17.13]So you're a movie actor in this, right?
[06:20.77]You're a stuntman.
[06:29.76]Stuntmans are actors.
[06:33.96]They have to not only drive the car, but they have to pretend to drive the car.
[06:39.04]They're gonna be in those camera shots.
[06:44.55]They have to look like they're fucking really driving as hard as they can.
[06:57.13]Stuntman Ignition.
[07:02.77]I thought I was watching an ad.
[07:03.97]Well, you kind of were.
[07:06.11]You kind of were watching an ad for this game.
[07:09.23]Stuntman Ignition uses an autosave feature.
[07:11.73]I'm actually probably gonna run out of room on this memory card here.
[07:16.05]There's been a lot of 8 megabyte save datas over the last six months on this thing.
[07:25.79]Well, I guess not.
[07:27.19]That's going to be a problem, though.
[07:28.21]Alright.
[07:31.87]Stuntman Ignition.
[07:33.27]Career.
[07:34.17]Quick-Fix.
[07:34.89]Options.
[07:37.33]Audio controls.
[07:38.23]Gameplay.
[07:39.79]Thrill cams on.
[07:40.71]This game kind of looks terrible.
[07:43.46]It's really blurry.
[07:47.78]This was the game that I properly raged at.
[07:54.87]Vibration off always.
[07:56.39]75, 75.
[07:56.83]Arrows on.
[07:57.89]Okay, we're just gonna keep this shit here.
[08:07.93]Wait, I gotta read the manual, right?
[08:09.07]This is like every PlayStation game.
[08:11.87]Okay, handbrake, brake.
[08:19.72]Gas.
[08:21.74]Camera control, action, and then look right and look left into nitro.
[08:25.96]Okay.
[08:28.13]Career.
[08:29.53]What are you doing?
[08:30.07]Why are you saving every five seconds?
[08:35.69]Should've got the PlayStation 3 version.
[08:37.15]Uh oh, Ricky Langston.
[08:47.34]This is your shot to get your foot in the door.
[08:49.90]Don't move it.
[08:54.16]Alright, action.
[08:55.24]Drive to drive?
[08:58.58]Dude.
[09:04.81]I did it.
[09:07.31]That's an S.
[09:13.64]That was the audition?
[09:23.12]That's a very expensive audition.
[09:24.66]Hello, I'm Richard Langston, director of Aftershock.
[09:27.36]Welcome to British Columbia.
[09:28.54]We're shooting a disaster movie up here, so you'll have plenty of work.
[09:31.96]Pyrotechnics, burning buildings, lava raining down from the sky.
[09:35.38]Hold on a second, please.
[09:36.88]This is Langston.
[09:37.64]This guy's a real asshole.
[09:38.72]Can you talk to him for me, Kate?
[09:39.90]Sure, not a problem.
[09:41.00]Hey, champ, I'm Kate Winthrop, the first AD.
[09:43.49]I'm told this is your first time on a big set, so I'll walk you through how it works.
[09:47.45]We'll have you wired up in your vehicle, and your coordinator will call out all the major director stunts we need you to hit, okay?
[09:53.97]He'll also mark them on your heads-up display with yellow stunt icons.
[09:57.61]These include drifts, gaps, jumps, closes, and other maneuvers.
[10:01.82]We'll be using a point system to judge your runs.
[10:04.42]All the directors do it.
[10:05.28]It's how we keep track of the drivers in the biz.
[10:07.44]More precisely you perform, more points you'll earn.
[10:10.42]Fail a director's fandom, it's a strike.
[10:12.90]Five strikes and Richard will have to call a reshoot.
[10:15.46]Oh, wait, do I get to have a strike here?
[10:17.12]With the other stuntmen that are getting fucking abused on set?
[10:20.36]You can earn up to five stars if you really nail it.
[10:24.77]Richard's been doing this a long time and he's well respected.
[10:27.25]Do what he asks and you'll start making a name for yourself.
[10:29.97]One second.
[10:30.47]Richard, anything else?
[10:31.59]Still on with the studio.
[10:32.99]Look, it was nice to meet you.
[10:34.21]I'll see you on the set.
[10:36.61]Yeah, nice to meet you too.
[10:40.42]Alright, kid, let's get you prepped for your work on this movie.
[10:43.15]As your stunt coordinator, it's what they pay me for.
[10:45.91]You'll drive four different vehicles on Aftershock.
[10:48.19]An R3000 sports coupe, an older SUV, a dirt bike, and a fire chief's patrol car.
[10:53.53]Each handles differently, and it may take you a while to get the hang of them, so just relax.
[10:57.95]These sets are big and chaotic, with live explosions, projectiles, and rivers of lava all around you.
[11:03.98]Avoid the lava, or the whole production will have to stop while the crew pulls you out.
[11:07.80]We've got some great stunts planned.
[11:09.56]There's a high-risk sequence racing over burning rooftops, and a huge finale where the town gets ripped apart.
[11:15.58]Before each scene, I'll give you shots of your key stunts with tips on how to pull them off.
[11:19.23]Right now, the stuntman is probably just sitting there with a dump in his pants, like, holy shit, I didn't... This is my first day!
[11:25.59]I thought I was gonna have to, like, put on a wig and pretend to be an old lady and fall down in a crosswalk!
[11:38.02]For your first scene, you'll double for the town's troublemaking drifter in his R3000 as he flees the volcanic eruption.
[11:44.42]The highlight will be this huge jump over a burning semi.
[11:48.14]The key is to hit the ramp straight.
[11:50.20]That'll set you up for the stunt that follows.
[11:52.72]As soon as you land, you'll have a pair of precision drivers coming at you fast, and you'll need to gap between them.
[11:58.02]It's dangerous, so be careful.
[11:59.94]And don't be afraid of retakes.
[12:01.54]Mr. Langston's a picky director, and it can take a while to make him happy.
[12:04.76]OK.
[12:06.72]Um, excuse me, can I go to the bathroom first?
[12:10.37]I kinda have to go to the bathroom.
[12:16.71]Alright, let's go.
[12:21.76]What?
[12:22.86]What do you mean, gap the cars?
[12:27.98]That was my first day!
[12:29.26]This is a tricky set.
[12:30.24]You need to watch out for those hazards.
[12:36.36]I thought I was supposed to jump.
[12:38.35]Hold on, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[12:41.13]I thought I was supposed to jump.
[12:42.60]Okay, then we turn.
[12:56.68]Um... What?
[12:59.16]Why have you destroyed a whole town?
[13:04.08]What?
[13:04.90]What was... Oh, yeah, well, we wanted an authentic.
[13:09.61]We put a bunch of hydrochloric acid in a local volcano.
[13:12.57]It wiped out fucking, like, an entire village.
[13:14.87]But at least we got it for the shot, right?
[13:27.00]God damn it.
[13:27.44]Alright, that was good.
[13:28.02]Alright, um, so I feel like this game's playing in slow motion.
[13:40.51]This is like 640 by 480.
[13:44.02]It's so blurry in my screen and it's playing at like 18 frames a second.
[14:01.79]Got it!
[14:07.30]Got it!
[14:08.98]They're killing people!
[14:10.88]Seriously, what the fuck is going on here?
[14:18.78]How many stunts do I have to do?
[14:26.38]These aren't stunts!
[14:31.84]Okay, I'm sorry, but you are just dropping molten bombs on these people.
[14:41.69]That was too boring.
[14:57.09]Too boring.
[14:58.39]You're gonna have like a Dead Sea Scrolls obituary for this 10 minute string here.
[15:05.00]Give me a break.
[15:17.72]I got a new car.
[15:21.18]Oh, with this one, we're going to have you jump over the ocean.
[15:24.12]Your car's going to get wings.
[15:25.02]You're going to fly past a plane.
[15:26.58]Be careful.
[15:27.04]Go under the plane.
[15:28.92]What the hell are they doing?
[15:30.38]Stuntman Ignition is all about stunt points.
[15:33.32]And stunt stringing is how you rack up the big numbers.
[15:36.84]Every stunt earns you points and goes into your stunt string.
[15:40.34]If you perform a stunt within two seconds of another stunt, that will continue your stunt string and add another number to your multiplier.
[15:49.81]Be sure to watch your stunt indicator on the upper left.
[15:52.77]It tells you what stunt you just performed and how long you have until your string breaks.
[15:57.35]You have to stunt before the string fades out.
[16:00.07]If it breaks, your string will be cashed out and added to your total score on the right.
[16:04.51]What stunts continue a string?
[16:06.49]All of them.
[16:07.36]Throw a drift.
[16:08.22]Get close to anything in the scene.
[16:10.12]Pass through a time gate.
[16:11.16]Hit a director stunt.
[16:12.24]Jump a ramp.
[16:12.82]You get the idea?
[16:13.94]Look for different ways or objects throughout the course to keep your string alive.
[16:17.92]Now if you want that fifth star, you're gonna have to string it.
[16:21.83]That means keep a continuous string from your first stunt to your last.
[16:26.07]Your total score should read zero if you string the entire level together.
[16:30.36]Try the stringing rehearsal and see if you can do it.
[16:33.23]And by the way, after you do all this, the actor's gonna come out of their trailer, go where you were at the time of the cut, say three sentences, and then go back in their trailer.
[16:45.19]What a fucking hard job.
[16:49.97]String the scene.
[16:51.86]Alright, let's string it.
[16:59.80]How do I- handbrake?
[17:06.96]Oops.
[17:08.34]On the car?
[17:13.29]Something's wrong with the car.
[17:23.89]The drift is... What jump?
[17:29.89]God damn it.
[17:32.44]Do it again, do it again, do it again.
[17:33.48]Alright.
[17:34.74]It's not as much of a drift as it is a hard stop.
[17:42.91]Yeah, that's not really a drift.
[17:48.45]This'll be good.
[18:00.57]Done.
[18:03.53]There's more.
[18:04.47]No, there's not.
[18:05.57]Okay, passed.
[18:06.35]Next scene.
[18:09.73]Alright, today's run will be the drifter's last scene when he tries to escape the town and gets torched by a lava boulder at the end.
[18:16.12]The feature stunt is the pyro charge.
[18:18.50]As you cross over a certain lava fissure in the ground, which will mark on your HUD, trigger the charge and set your car on fire.
[18:24.75]You'll get hot, but you'll be wearing a cool suit.
[18:28.14]Once you're lit, drift hard to the right and gap through the car wash.
[18:31.55]That'll extinguish the fire.
[18:32.49]Through the car wash?
[18:33.31]And race on to the big finale.
[18:35.15]And remember, kid, watch out for that lava.
[18:38.37]Yeah, by the way, our director is a real fucking psycho.
[18:41.59]He's decided to make a mousetrap in real life.
[18:45.16]There aren't even any actors here.
[18:51.56]So what was it, get lit on fire?
[18:59.20]I'm dead.
[19:04.98]There we go.
[19:05.42]Three, two, one.
[19:06.54]Got it.
[19:07.52]There's a real volcano here.
[19:09.48]Alright, hit the- right here.
[19:14.09]Okay, I see.
[19:32.36]Why are there other people driving?
[19:37.36]That was just the time crisis guy.
[19:47.92]Get in the... Get... Beautiful!
[20:05.45]Jump.
[20:18.52]They just threw a car at us.
[20:21.82]Oh, shit.
[20:28.55]Yeah, the really hard part was Donkey Kong was really expensive to hire for this.
[20:32.69]No!
[20:44.50]Come on!
[20:45.46]Just edit it.
[20:46.72]Why do we have to do this in one take?
[20:58.59]They're all one up on each other now.
[20:59.89]Now didn't you see Birdman?
[21:02.97]We have to do that with these fucking horrible stunts.
[21:06.39]They've raised the bar for us.
[21:21.88]Watch it.
[21:35.40]Seamless.
[21:36.44]It was better than last time.
[21:37.74]Watch the guy throw the car.
[21:44.75]Did I not hit it?
[21:51.40]What was wrong with that?
[21:52.48]I killed that guy.
[22:06.82]I killed that guy.
[22:11.95]Is that it?
[22:14.59]Cut.
[22:15.49]That's reasonable work, as green as you are.
[22:24.46]It didn't ignite.
[22:31.25]So wait a minute.
[22:32.91]You're telling me that Christopher Sabat, the voice of Vegeta, is the guy that says ACTION in Time Crisis?
[22:46.38]Really?
[22:47.66]Wow.
[22:57.74]This is the movie!
[23:06.83]This is the scene from the movie!
[23:20.41]Pretty good!
[23:23.62]I wish there was dialog over this.
[23:24.86]That was pretty good.
[23:36.23]Oh, my window smashed.
[23:37.61]Look at how talented I am as a driver.
[23:39.91]I hope nobody was in there.
[23:52.14]It's the windshield.
[23:53.26]You blame it on the windshield.
[23:54.30]That could be, like, a comedy part of the movie.
[23:56.84]Where, like, there's gotta be, like, a sassy British guy in here.
[24:01.48]I can't see out of the fucking window, mate!
[24:03.30]And they're, like, arguing back and forth, and that happens, and then there's no more dialog.
[24:23.08]Alright, two, two.
[24:25.55]Motorcycle.
[24:28.12]We're gonna get stuck here.
[24:28.78]Let's talk motorcycles, kid.
[24:30.68]Directors love them because they're fast and loud and add punch to any scene.
[24:34.96]But they're also harder to control.
[24:36.44]They're a lot more dangerous, so watch out or they'll be mopping your skull off the pavement.
[24:41.14]There are two major stunts unique to the bike.
[24:43.82]First is the wheelie.
[24:45.06]It's a great way to start any motor run and keep your strings alive.
[24:49.17]Pull back on the left analog stick as you hit the gas.
[24:51.99]Pull back while you hit the gas.
[24:53.95]Push forward to drop back down.
[24:56.11]Then there's the slide.
[24:57.59]To pull it off, perform the action as you pass through the designated stunt box.
[25:02.25]Okay.
[25:02.55]That'll make you lay the bike down on one side while you're still barreling forward.
[25:06.61]So in the box.
[25:08.65]How do you do the slide?
[25:10.05]Simple as that.
[25:11.13]What combination of buttons is it?
[25:14.41]He just said do it.
[25:16.17]You gotta be in the stunt box.
[25:18.51]Is it just... It's just simply the action button.
[25:23.39]What's the action button?
[25:31.79]Triangle, okay.
[25:32.29]Here we go.
[25:34.51]Uh, press Triangle.
[25:41.40]Oops.
[25:41.80]Good slide.
[25:44.60]I pressed Triangle.
[26:02.48]Nice drift.
[26:09.06]What?
[26:09.20]U-turn?
[26:10.20]Alright, so what did I do wrong there?
[26:18.76]Not pass.
[26:20.80]Let me do it again.
[26:34.60]Hit the dab.
[26:36.22]Alright, slide.
[26:42.22]I'm pressing triangle.
[26:44.83]Slide under.
[27:17.89]So... Square is the slide button.
[27:24.02]So it's not triangle.
[27:25.08]It's square.
[27:32.10]No, that's not it either.
[27:33.49]R1?
[27:37.05]I'm not on the bike anymore.
[27:43.45]It's R1.
[27:44.11]Okay, R1.
[27:44.37]There we go.
[27:46.83]It is R1.
[27:48.55]Triangle.
[28:10.77]This is fun.
[28:11.31]I just wish it was in a higher resolution.
[28:26.00]Alright, good.
[28:30.81]Good.
[28:33.25]Hit the jump with wheelie.
[28:36.76]Alright, pass.
[28:39.46]God damn it!
[28:40.64]Okay, I passed, we're fine.
[28:44.98]In this scene, you'll be doubling for a desperate teen racing through the carnage to rescue his grandmother in her mountain cabin.
[28:51.28]The key stunt begins with a jump.
[28:52.36]You'll be the grandmother.
[28:53.52]I can't.
[28:53.90]I'm sorry.
[28:56.48]Keep it high speed when you land.
[28:58.42]Then a blast will hurl a couple of cars.
[29:00.34]I finally get to be the grandma.
[29:01.40]Serious force.
[29:02.68]Dodge under the flying cars by sliding the bike like we rehearsed.
[29:06.44]After the slide, you'll move real quick into a hard drift left, so be ready for it.
[29:10.90]Continue up the mountain and end at the grandmother's house.
[29:18.11]Alright, let's go.
[29:21.14]Dodge under the flying cars.
[29:25.34]Why are there flying cars?
[29:27.00]Drift!
[29:28.88]I was doing a wheelie for no reason.
[29:45.96]This game is on the 360 in PS3?
[29:48.61]Well, fuck me, really?
[29:51.27]Can I slide?
[29:59.52]Close left?
[30:00.18]There are better versions.
[30:09.31]It's way better on those.
[30:11.27]I didn't know.
[30:12.19]Why is it on PS2?
[30:14.07]Why would it be on PS2?
[30:15.61]Left.
[30:15.91]The original is on PS2?
[30:22.00]Fuck.
[30:40.25]Drip turn left.
[30:49.65]More time.
[30:50.35]Add it.
[30:51.31]Left.
[30:53.21]Come on!
[30:54.17]Get on the bike!
[30:55.29]Get on!
[30:55.71]Get on!
[30:57.81]Okay, we're good.
[31:12.60]That was pretty sick.
[31:13.84]Got it.
[31:14.26]What?
[31:42.28]Right when I landed the tire.
[31:45.50]Nice.
[31:46.58]Taurus World Stunt Award nominations to Grandma's House We Go.
[31:49.49]I got the award.
[31:50.25]Let's take a look at how that movie played out.
[32:02.43]Nice.
[32:03.05]I gotta get to Grandma's.
[32:18.61]Yeah, he did fight one of the cars.
[32:20.33]They left that in.
[32:27.09]Yeah, he didn't predict that was gonna happen.
[32:29.35]Should've got extra points for that one.
[32:34.27]Yeah, these days, all these fucking little shits, all they use is CGI.
[32:42.35]Back in the day, you used to get actually hit by fucking cars.
[32:47.73]That's the end of the movie.
[32:54.98]Those camera angles suck.
[32:58.28]Earthshake.
[33:04.81]Alright, we got the Earthshake scene.
[33:06.39]What?
[33:22.01]I kind of want to play, should I just get this for PS3?
[33:23.81]And just like play up to where I am now.
[33:25.31]I feel like, I feel like this is a whole stream.
[33:52.31]Can we do, like, another one or two?
[34:02.04]What happened to that car?
[34:05.90]Did I... I'm not gonna make the sign.
[34:28.78]That's too... This is just a guy that bought a motorcycle and has no training, doesn't even know how to ride it.
[34:58.16]I kind of like how crusty it is on PS2, though.
[35:00.32]Easy.
[35:01.66]Close.
[35:01.90]Through the sign.
[35:09.63]Bingo.
[35:12.95]Got it.
[35:29.61]What?
[35:29.95]Oh, my stomach.
[35:32.79]Oh, I couldn't even laugh.
[35:34.95]Land on the box.
[35:42.48]Land on the box?
[35:47.62]Ah.
[35:49.20]Trip left.
[35:50.45]Break through.
[35:50.75]Am I going fast enough?
[35:51.41]Slide under.
[35:57.35]I tried to press L. R1.
[36:01.75]R1 didn't work.
[36:05.98]Quick!
[36:08.86]I swear to god.
[36:10.40]I pressed it.
[36:17.09]I didn't get it.
[36:19.71]I'm not gonna pass this shit.
[36:31.85]It worked.
[36:42.40]What stunt are we filming here exactly?
[36:44.16]Good question.
[36:44.70]Alright, didn't fall off that time.
[36:49.30]Good.
[36:58.55]This was perfect.
[37:09.66]I didn't stick the landing very well.
[37:12.52]It's okay.
[37:13.26]He's alright.
[37:13.86]I love these camera angles.
[37:21.17]They make this so much better.
[37:23.13]I don't even care about the video game.
[37:24.63]I just want to watch like the full movie.
[37:34.41]I only fall down twice, right?
[37:35.72]Do I fall down three times?
[37:42.62]We're so far away!
[37:55.14]What a terrible movie!
[37:57.27]You can't even see anything!
[38:01.33]What a waste of footage!
[38:11.20]I gotta get a new B-team here, man.
[38:25.02]Yeah, I... Oh, man, this is fun.
[38:28.61]This is fun.
[38:29.07]I'm doing terribly, but it's okay.
[38:31.07]Stunt City Fire.
[38:34.09]Whoopin' and Hollerin' 2.
[38:35.73]Okay, we got a new area.
[38:45.06]This one's locked.
[38:48.07]Director Intro.
[38:48.91]Alright, so now we gotta move on to... This is Whoopin' and Hollerin' 2.
[38:51.23]We got a new movie.
[38:54.58]Can I watch... I wish I could watch the whole movie or something.
[38:58.99]What's up, dude?
[38:59.61]I'm the director, Andy Baxter.
[39:02.45]Andy in the house!
[39:04.39]Hey, guys, this is the stunt driver.
[39:06.27]You're the stunt driver, dude?
[39:10.05]I thought you only had beards.
[39:11.72]Jim Boy's playing the lead, so you'll be doubling.
[39:13.56]What did he just say?
[39:14.24]It's for a reality show.
[39:15.24]We had Jim fly up a bridge in his shopping cart with handcuffs on him.
[39:18.60]He was like chained to a goat.
[39:19.88]That was sweet!
[39:20.80]That goat ain't coming, man!
[39:22.34]That's our version of stunt driving, man.
[39:24.47]Anyway, dude, this flick's called Hooping and Hollering 2.
[39:26.95]Back roads, back roads, and Cracker Fest with some troublemaking brothers getting in car chases with the cops and all that kind of stuff.
[39:33.51]Just like your Trader Barton family reunion.
[39:35.50]Hey, that's Mr. Seaton.
[39:36.88]I can tell that one from a mile away.
[39:39.97]Oh god, this is gonna be...
[40:06.81]Look, kid, this director's a clown, so we may have to work double time to give the producers what they want, because, of course, they sign our checks.
[40:13.90]You'll mostly double for the Creek Boys and their signature muscle car, the General Stewart, as they try to stop the corrupt sheriff from foreclosing on their family's land.
[40:21.87]You'll also have a scene on a dirt bike as the crazy brother Otis...
[40:25.48]a fun scene as Uncle Cletus in his monster truck full of moonshine, and a great run as a bank robber in a hijacked armored truck.
[40:32.70]This will be your first time to shoot chase scenes, so be sure not to fall too far behind the lead car, or we'll have to stop and reset.
[40:39.83]Most of the action happens in the town square, but we've also got some exciting stunts planned in the junkyard and in the lumberyard.
[40:46.29]Baxter and his crew are all about backwoods mayhem, so I hope you're ready to tear things up.
[40:52.00]Literally.
[40:52.62]He thought I was playing Metro.
[40:54.63]In this first scene, the Creek Boys Uncle Cletus has loaded a ton of moonshine into his monster truck, and he's trying to escape the cops.
[41:02.01]Big thing here are the crushing stunts.
[41:04.49]When you see a crush icon, drive your truck over the marked car to smash it.
[41:09.94]This is a tightly choreographed run, and if the icon turns red, that means the car's left the shot and you've blown your chance.
[41:16.40]What?
[41:16.60]That's about it.
[41:17.47]Let's start this movie right.
[41:19.35]Why would I crush the car with somebody?
[41:29.66]Alright, let's go.
[41:31.46]Three, two, one, action.
[41:34.96]Hit the police car.
[41:36.94]Hit the police cars.
[41:37.74]Alright, that was the wrong one.
[41:38.90]Somebody might've been in that one.
[41:41.44]Hard right.
[41:44.28]Hit the police car.
[41:48.24]Smash the sign.
[41:51.13]Hit the police cars.
[41:52.84]What was it?
[41:56.86]Reshoot.
[41:57.96]Cut!
[41:59.06]Sorry, man.
[41:59.68]That's too many mess-ups.
[42:08.81]Three, two, one.
[42:11.21]Action.
[42:12.19]Hit the police car.
[42:14.05]Hit the police cars.
[42:16.19]Not that one.
[42:16.69]The police cars.
[42:17.43]One, two, three.
[42:18.07]Hard right.
[42:22.54]Hit the police car.
[42:23.54]Got it.
[42:25.72]Smash the side.
[42:27.62]Wait, how am I supposed to get over that?
[42:34.04]Hit the police cars.
[42:35.02]What the fuck?
[42:36.92]Jump the logs.
[42:37.64]Jump into the tower.
[42:38.78]I'm not going to make it.
[42:42.09]Hit the police car.
[42:43.87]There's so much crust.
[42:53.39]There's too much crust!
[42:55.01]I'm playing this on an iPhone screen that has been blown up 15 times.
[42:59.87]Stop the tape!
[43:00.85]Dude, hit the gas!
[43:01.89]You're moving too slow!
[43:10.06]I'm gonna have to get the PS3 one.
[43:11.26]This game's really fun, but there might be too much.
[43:13.52]I might have left this one in the oven for too long.
[43:15.02]Hit the police car!
[43:16.76]Hit the police cars!
[43:25.10]Police car.
[43:28.17]Smash the sign.
[43:31.51]Hit the police cars.
[43:32.63]Police cars.
[43:33.71]Jump the logs.
[43:35.33]Jump into the tower.
[43:40.41]Hit the police car.
[43:43.72]Close to the semi.
[43:45.70]Fuck.
[43:46.66]Hit the jump.
[43:50.96]Action.
[43:58.48]Come on!
[43:59.50]That's gotta be at least 3 for this type.
[44:04.78]Alright, I'm okay with a 3 star.
[44:10.66]Ignite your vehicle for the first time.
[44:14.27]Monster Mesh.
[44:16.69]Bonus Color Customizer.
[44:19.55]Monster Truck unlocked.
[44:21.07]Alright, let's go.
[44:25.54]Get it on PS3 before you get too far.
[44:29.44]Is there another one?
[44:30.20]Like, is there another game?
[44:35.40]Is there another Stuntman?
[44:49.50]I like the crust, but it might be too much crust.
[44:55.88]Put in the original one for PS2.
[45:03.86]Let's try.
[45:04.30]How about the original one?
[45:05.85]I have that one.
[45:06.41]Yeah, there's a little too much.
[45:09.85]There's too much crossed on this one.
[45:12.73]Hold on.
[45:12.91]I'm going to put the first one.
[45:15.03]I'm going to get this for PS3.
[45:15.91]I'm going to play this.
[45:16.57]I'm going to get up to where I am right now.
[45:19.23]This game is really fun.
[45:20.07]Give me a second.
[45:32.69]Let's try the first one.
[45:41.08]We're going from Stuntman 2 to Stuntman 1.
[45:43.36]There was a modern Stuntman, which is going backwards in time.
[46:06.61]Downgrade to another downgrade.
[46:10.03]I didn't know you could actually watch the movie after.
[46:11.93]That's really fun.
[46:13.75]Well, and we knew it was gonna happen.
[46:19.17]You knew it was gonna happen eventually.
[46:20.21]Hold on.
[46:28.18]I have to go delete a bunch of shit.
[46:32.46]What is it?
[46:32.80]System browser?
[46:33.64]What is it?
[46:41.01]Why is there so many alias?
[46:43.75]What the hell is even on here?
[46:46.93]Stuntman, career, clock tower, three, alias, casino, five, one, two, three.
[46:56.92]Celebrity death match, remember that one?
[46:58.92]True crime.
[47:00.26]Fifth grader, are you smarter than a fifth grader?
[47:05.26]Madden NFL, set one.
[47:12.71]Madden NFL.
[47:15.75]These are old.
[47:16.47]You gotta... Oh, look at this.
[47:18.03]All these old, old... The X Team.
[47:22.75]The Imperfects.
[47:26.60]Monster Rancher 3.
[47:27.40]Yeah, we can go ahead and fucking delete this.
[47:33.76]That game sucked.
[47:38.75]I'm gonna delete this person's rosters. 2012.
[47:46.94]That was Monster Rancher 3, not Monster Rancher 2.
[47:51.16]You think I would delete Monster Rancher 2?
[47:54.39]I can't delete that.
[47:55.11]Sentimental.
[47:56.93]I like that video.
[47:58.07]I like that stream.
[47:59.83]Yeah, this was stupid.
[48:04.25]2 was the one... 3 was the one that was bad.
[48:07.89]What are you guys talking about?
[48:14.36]Pretty much all the Madden NFL 08 can be deleted.
[48:25.17]What about this?
[48:25.65]What's this one?
[48:27.27]EEE?
[48:28.25]The Miz?
[48:30.37]Oh, at Ed and Eddie.
[48:32.07]Here's the Godfather.
[48:36.84]No, don't copy the Godfather.
[48:38.16]Okay.
[48:46.04]That's what I thought.
[48:46.80]I don't have a question in one of my decisions.
[48:54.83]Alright, I think we're good.
[49:06.34]We had 1,700 for you, we're good.
[49:09.26]Professor, Professor, goodbye.
[49:14.85]What else is here?
[49:16.29]Can I get rid of all these... Look at how much space this takes up for alias.
[49:32.26]This is half the memory card.
[49:34.38]Our alias save files.
[49:36.84]Get the hell out of here.
[49:38.22]Alright, that should be good.
[49:42.00]No, get rid of these.
[49:45.55]Stop deleting my memories.
[49:48.01]Okay.
[49:54.32]We got 5,000 free.
[49:55.04]That's enough.
[49:56.52]This is the Incredible Hulk.
[49:57.84]Why is he... Alright.
[49:59.10]I got a question.
[49:59.70]Why is the Incredible Hulk icon so small?
[50:04.64]Shouldn't it be huge?
[50:05.58]Why does it have to be so little?
[50:12.87]Alright.
[50:13.21]That should be fine.
[50:19.53]I would smash your PS2 if I was there.
[50:25.25]Alright.
[50:28.49]You would smash my PlayStation 2.
[50:32.81]What a dick.
[50:42.66]Yeah.
[50:43.38]I would just get another one.
[50:52.68]What you don't know is... I got like six of them back here.
[50:58.43]Did this just say bullshit?
[51:02.95]What did it just say?
[51:07.19]In the days of its infancy, the stunt performance profession was pioneered by the daring and ingenuity of acrobats and circus acts.
[51:16.20]As the public's demand for on-screen chases, crashes, jumps, smashes, and explosions is never satisfied, so the stunt performer has evolved into a highly trained professional.
[51:29.29]This is not a life for the timid.
[51:31.91]This is where men and women challenge the impossible.
[51:35.27]We really did default.
[51:36.46]We went back to like the 20s.
[51:54.99]Shit, somebody's in that car.
[51:57.67]Insane.
[52:26.95]Alright, here we go.
[52:27.81]Stuntman, the original.
[52:30.01]The first one.
[52:32.52]Stuntman career stunt constructor.
[52:41.16]Set up DVD extras.
[52:57.90]Is this a movie?
[53:03.95]Wait, is this for the terrible one that's for... 64, the one that everybody hated?
[53:11.63]This is one of the worst games ever made, isn't it?
[53:14.55]Over 40 minutes of cinematics.
[53:41.19]Well, don't say that and not give us any... You gotta give us a clip.
[53:44.88]You didn't... Voice acted by the original cast.
[53:48.80]Which you're not going to hear a sample of.
[53:50.78]In the trailer.
[53:55.20]Shadow of Apocalypse.
[53:58.08]That's not how you spell that.
[53:58.85]What else we got?
[54:07.76]Hello?
[54:07.96]What are you doing?
[54:09.14]Why am I fading to black?
[54:10.36]Splashdown.
[54:10.88]What is the next project coming up here?
[54:12.34]Miami.
[54:39.50]somebody look it up what's their last project here what's the last thing they made driver
[55:06.11]What- I don't know what this- what is this supposed to be?
[55:09.34]Driver 3.
[55:13.74]This is not Driver 3.
[55:15.62]How good would it be Driver 3 when he's not driving a car?
[55:28.99]Is that the door for the car?
[55:30.07]Okay, this is Driver 3.
[55:34.20]You don't think he should have a car in the trailer?
[55:40.07]The closest that an elevator was the closest thing to a moving automobile.
[55:44.93]In that whole trailer for Driver 3.
[55:46.17]You'd think he'd say no.
[56:00.89]Other guys wouldn't be seen for dust, but we push it right to the edge.
[56:06.75]The whole commercial.
[56:12.02]It's on the PlayStation 3 eShop for $10.
[56:15.70]I can download it while I'm playing this?
[56:17.34]Well, that's not possible.
[56:21.20]The PlayStation 3 is not hooked up right now.
[56:23.03]The PlayStation 2 is.
[56:23.81]I would have to, like, I don't have, like, another mod.
[56:27.15]I can't.
[56:27.43]That's impossible.
[56:30.31]It's not my career.
[56:31.35]That's for another day.
[56:43.97]Um, it don't matter.
[56:45.27]I can't just make it... No, I don't want to do... How about, like, this alien name?
[56:48.61]Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
[57:18.58]That's me!
[57:18.86]What?
[57:18.98]Is that part of the movie or is that guy talking about how he was gonna get hit by a car and possibly die?
[57:25.22]What?
[57:25.34]Toothless in Wapping.
[57:49.67]That was gonna happen.
[57:50.39]I might get clipped.
[57:52.18]And then... It's shown on the internet somewhere on my community of people, like, taking me out of context and clipping me, saying something stupid.
[58:00.56]And, like, posting it in places, and now I look like an asshole.
[58:02.46]This movie's a gangster comedy.
[58:03.99]Two hopeless small-timers up against the police in gangland kingpin The Dentist.
[58:09.63]One of the leads, Vince, is trying to get across town for a pickup, but he's already late.
[58:16.54]I'll have constant radio communication with the director for every stunt I do.
[58:21.54]Time to get on set.
[58:22.54]Well, without Christopher Sabat, I don't even care anymore.
[58:29.90]It's magic what a good voice actor could bring to the game.
[58:37.06]Toothless and whopping.
[58:38.06]Scene four, take one.
[58:39.48]What?
[58:41.02]Accelerate.
[58:41.82]180 e-brake.
[58:46.13]What?
[58:48.03]You didn't even give me an... Apparently that didn't work.
[58:52.53]Alright, the e-brake is way more sensitive in the original version.
[59:05.95]It's even crustier.
[59:07.19]I mean, you're talking about you... on your special instructions on your online order at Pizza Hut.
[59:15.20]You said, leave it in the oven.
[59:18.70]For an extra ten minutes.
[59:20.10]How is that not a 180?
[59:20.68]Yeah, not only that, you said use twice as much dough.
[59:37.16]I want, like, four more inches of crust.
[59:44.95]What is happening here?
[59:57.08]I'm doing an e-brake.
[59:59.56]That's the e-brake, right?
[60:00.60]180 e-brake.
[60:01.92]Huh?
[60:14.74]How are you supposed to do this?
[60:19.34]It's square in this one.
[60:21.44]No, it's not.
[60:21.92]Is it really?
[60:22.94]It's triangle in this one?
[60:24.26]Wait, they changed it on me?
[60:30.05]Square.
[60:30.43]Now that's regular brake!
[60:36.39]That's regular brake, guys.
[60:40.55]Hold on.
[60:41.63]The e-brake is definitely circle still.
[60:51.40]Is SpongeBob driving the car?
[60:59.07]If you need instructions, check out the instructional booklet.
[61:05.51]Triangle?
[61:08.96]I don't think that's a possible move to do with the car here.
[61:22.39]Do I have to do that?
[61:25.66]I don't think it's an indicator.
[61:26.90]I think you just have to do it.
[61:27.84]I don't think it's like, you did it.
[61:38.05]Yeah, it's the... okay.
[61:39.33]You just have to do it.
[61:40.03]Yeah, alright.
[61:50.43]You don't... you actually don't have to... I get it.
[61:55.55]And the other one, when you do it, it's like... the thing lights up green.
[62:03.10]Got a new car?
[62:05.32]You've earned a new ramp.
[62:07.62]A new arena toy.
[62:08.24]What?
[62:08.36]They do that?
[62:10.89]But what if they... What if the car... What if there's a shot of the person driving this two steering wheels?
[62:35.99]You have, like, a Wii Sports steering wheel in your lap?
[62:40.93]That's not how they do it.
[62:42.02]Yeah, why can't you just hire- In this scene, Vince and Ray escape to the docks with the safe in the back of the car.
[62:58.75]I need to do a 180 turn here, then stop close to the jetty edge to make it look good.
[63:07.40]Alright.
[63:09.56]Internal exposition here.
[63:17.03]Wow, we really did add extra crust and devolved.
[63:27.94]What about that guy?
[63:29.04]Hit the guy!
[63:36.53]I missed them all.
[63:40.60]Go back to the other game?
[63:41.38]Well, I'm gonna get the other one for PlayStation 3.
[63:43.40]So it doesn't look like it's a blown-up iPad screen.
[63:46.88]That guy's reaction just fucked me up so bad.
[64:04.93]What?
[64:05.21]What are you going to do?
[64:06.49]Swing round?
[64:06.77]Break in the boxes and swing round.
[64:08.93]Reverse 44 degrees.
[64:36.65]And then swing round.
[65:08.34]That's too much crust on that one.
[65:13.47]That's too much crust.
[65:15.13]I'm trying to back up.
[65:16.01]I'm covered in fucking pizza dough.
[65:22.07]We're going to put in 25 to life.
[65:33.20]Stuntman Ignition I'm going to get to play as three.
[65:34.74]We're actually going to play it.
[65:39.04]Play Muppets Party Cruise!
[65:46.24]Oh, he's so bad he can't even swing round.
[65:50.50]We went backwards.
[65:52.50]The sequel was better than the original, and we watched the original movie.
[65:57.47]We did it in reverse.
[65:58.33]That's not how you're supposed to watch Lord of the Rings.
[66:02.17]That's not how you watch Star Wars.
[66:10.89]Now, this is an Eidos game.
[66:12.19]I don't know why every one of these gets captured strangely.
[66:19.19]See what I'm saying?
[66:21.77]Like, this mix is like a weird box for all of them.
[66:30.56]25 to life.
[66:38.78]By Eidos Interactive.
[66:48.09]What the fuck is happening?
[66:55.41]What have you missed?
[67:06.50]How did nobody get hit by any of that?
[67:12.52]Was I playing laser tag?
[67:20.61]Yeah, even in the slow motion, here comes like a slow motion shot.
[67:24.25]You missed!
[67:24.77]That was a very weird intro, yeah.
[67:44.50]Let's go.
[67:48.16]Memory card does not have a valid save profile.
[67:52.03]Retry.
[67:52.53]What do you mean it doesn't have a valid profile?
[67:59.25]You must create a new profile.
[68:00.50]Okay.
[68:02.92]Oh, we got a copyright song here.
[68:04.48]Profile 1, doesn't matter.
[68:06.92]I gotta get rid of the copyrighted music.
[68:11.92]No, no, no, no!
[68:17.43]Back!
[68:17.71]I gotta get rid of the- I don't want the VOD muted!
[68:19.53]Go back!
[68:21.31]Quick!
[68:22.15]Alright.
[68:26.07]Are we good?
[68:34.55]I think we're good.
[68:37.79]Aiming is normal.
[68:39.85]No, normal.
[68:41.22]Blood and guts enabled.
[68:57.15]Multiplayer online.
[68:59.15]God.
[68:59.83]Singleplayer.
[69:01.31]Normal.
[69:04.43]Available levels, is it... Oh, there's easy, normal, hard, and oh my fucking god.
[69:10.15]I'm not gonna do that one.
[69:13.33]What's that guy doing?
[69:20.88]No subtitles?
[69:24.64]You're just a little rump, baby boy.
[69:26.78]You taking up all the good loving.
[69:28.80]He might be your daddy, but he's my man.
[69:33.52]So where you been?
[69:35.14]You smell like sticky, icky, ooey.
[69:37.75]You been hanging out with that asshole Sean again?
[69:39.77]I know he acts like a sucker, but he's still my best peoples.
[69:43.65]So get off his case.
[69:45.30]Only God could judge him.
[69:47.00]Darnell, go to your room.
[69:49.20]Damn, Mom.
[69:49.92]I always miss the good fights.
[69:51.96]What?
[69:56.03]You promised me you would get out the game.
[69:58.27]I'm ready to be out to Miami.
[70:00.29]We talked about it, but Sean ain't trying to hear me.
[70:03.69]Yo, it ain't that easy to walk away from this game, Monica.
[70:07.45]This shit is all I know.
[70:08.91]You're gonna be knowing this game all by yourself in a minute.
[70:12.29]I'm not raising a child who screams thug life all day.
[70:15.47]Tomorrow, Freeze, I wanna book the plane tickets tomorrow.
[70:18.61]How you expect us to eat?
[70:20.69]I gotta get this paper by any means necessary.
[70:26.34]I don't really know what's going on.
[70:30.59]What am I going to do?
[70:34.25]Oh, perfect timing for a phone call.
[70:37.71]Oh, back when the phones were on the wall and you had to actually go answer it.
[70:40.23]This is the Francis family.
[70:41.89]No one's home right now.
[70:43.58]Leave a positive message.
[70:45.08]Thanks.
[70:47.78]Yo, mi hermano.
[70:48.54]What's good?
[70:49.02]De lo que hay?
[70:49.82]Listen, I thought about what you said.
[70:54.06]Run, run, run, grab it!
[70:54.88]Hey, hey, what's up, man?
[70:55.62]Yeah, I'm here.
[70:59.76]What?
[71:01.88]Did he just check his phone for a missed call?
[71:07.47]No, no, no, I deleted the copyrighted music.
[71:09.43]Don't put it in here.
[71:11.17]I'm out, player.
[71:12.55]I ain't built for this anymore.
[71:14.19]I ain't gonna let you leave, motherfucker.
[71:16.37]I made you.
[71:17.39]We connected for life.
[71:18.94]I can't be the dope man forever.
[71:21.18]My seed can't grow up in this street drama.
[71:23.32]Man, I can't believe you letting a bitch break up our family.
[71:27.28]This is supposed to be M.O.B.
[71:28.42]Don't get over bitches.
[71:31.27]Come on, don't disrespect my lady.
[71:33.79]And you don't have to justify my thug.
[71:36.21]I know I made a deal with the devil by being in the game.
[71:46.47]Fuck it.
[71:47.59]I don't like it, but I can respect that.
[71:49.29]Who is this?
[71:50.09]You can be out after one more big job.
[71:52.37]This time, it ain't no 50,000 ecstasy deal with no bull in Arizona.
[71:56.31]It's time to get some major pay.
[71:58.23]You know what I'm talking about?
[71:59.20]I'm talking straight Escobar style.
[72:00.96]Alright.
[72:02.20]Whatever.
[72:03.96]So after this last job, then everything's straight.
[72:06.48]For sure, homie.
[72:07.12]Alright, then.
[72:08.78]I knew we could work it out.
[72:12.26]One day soon, my brother.
[72:13.04]Don't!
[72:13.50]What are you?
[72:13.82]Don't point that!
[72:14.96]Or chapter one, one last deal.
[72:24.83]There's only one more bargain.
[72:27.37]This is... Who are those guys?
[72:28.62]What is that supposed to mean?
[72:29.88]You can... Fuck!
[72:56.67]This was written by AI.
[72:59.01]This is just, okay, you know when you open your iPhone and you just auto-end sentences?
[73:03.95]You just fill in the words with the auto-word that it has?
[73:06.31]You know that, like, that joke on Twitter people do?
[73:08.59]This whole script was written by the autocorrect iPhone fill-in-the-blanks thing.
[73:17.84]The predictive text.
[73:19.12]That's the whole script is written by predictive text.
[73:24.85]Fight your way to the warehouse.
[73:26.21]Take secondary objectives.
[73:27.77]Take two human shields.
[73:29.11]Defeat 20 enemies.
[73:30.03]Achieve 15% accuracy.
[73:34.86]Freeze arrived at the West Harbor warehouse.
[73:36.34]He's ready to do the deal.
[73:37.78]But the money drop has gone bad.
[73:39.40]Detective Maria Mendoza was waiting for you and the Colombians were dead before you got there.
[73:44.27]The police are about to swarm the area and Mendoza is going to pin a double murder on you.
[73:48.79]Escape by any means.
[73:54.31]R1.
[73:54.47]Okay.
[74:00.08]Look at the... I love the playlist down there that's not playing.
[74:04.50]Can I drive a car?
[74:06.90]Okay.
[74:28.25]Well, you were gonna pin a double murder on me, but now I actually have, like, a quadruple murder.
[74:35.59]I thought the whole purpose of this was to get out of here.
[74:38.41]And not... Shit, I gotta get out of here!
[74:44.62]She's gonna... I've been framed for a double murder!
[74:48.62]Might as well go for a septuple kill, actually.
[75:01.73]Climb.
[75:20.05]I thought I was going for a stealth kill.
[75:38.36]This game just sucks.
[75:43.64]This is just the beginning of every PUBG match.
[75:52.98]Okay.
[76:13.31]Ha ha ha ha ha, VR streamer.
[76:15.39]Press to lean around corners.
[76:27.84]No, wait, hold on.
[76:32.90]Up is... Who's driving over me?
[76:35.28]Oh, you can just talk.
[76:51.14]Why is he leaving?
[77:00.05]Talking about crust.
[77:03.99]I'm not even sure this classifies as a pizza.
[77:08.72]Somebody just... I opened my mouth and somebody just took the big vat of restaurant industry tomato sauce and just threw it into my face.
[77:32.29]How do I not get exploded?
[77:33.15]Where are you?
[77:33.63]There was a health pack.
[77:34.77]Can I fall under the health pack and be alive?
[77:36.75]I just touched it.
[78:13.80]Jesus!
[78:24.09]Turn off the fence power grid.
[78:28.39]Wait, it's electrified?! !
[78:37.06]Shit.
[78:37.50]I just have to... Come on, I have to get through the first level.
[78:49.81]Where's this guy?
[79:10.98]What?
[79:12.36]How do I get off of fire?
[79:14.78]Oh, I'm still on fire.
[79:17.50]Okay, it doesn't seem to really bother him that much.
[79:20.42]Turn off the power grid.
[79:24.10]Where's the power grid?
[79:26.14]Turn off the power!
[79:27.10]Shoot it?
[79:40.64]Up there?
[79:41.08]How the hell do I go?
[79:50.92]The ladder?
[79:51.40]Is there... Just follow the green gas.
[80:00.95]Uh... The green gas is up there.
[80:28.54]Shoot the lock?
[80:34.69]Open the door, the door is electrified!
[80:55.97]Grab the fence!
[80:57.71]Go around?
[80:58.53]I mean, go around where?
[81:24.83]Do I have to go in this building?
[81:37.25]There's a door near the red car.
[81:40.87]Wait, how the fuck did you know that?
[81:43.99]Wait, what?
[81:50.91]You're talking about this one.
[82:02.86]I'm almost dead.
[82:06.01]Blind?
[82:07.25]Do you see how much fucking pizza crust is on this?
[82:12.43]Do you see this?
[82:15.31]Make it full screen!
[82:33.50]Can I touch this?
[82:42.80]Yeah, it's definitely even crustier for you guys.
[82:46.00]It has to go through a compression.
[82:54.34]I was gonna say Virtual Boy.
[83:03.29]Is there health?
[83:03.75]I need health.
[83:05.91]Give that to me.
[83:09.27]I'm not doing it again.
[83:11.12]Why is he on fire?
[83:35.09]Shit.
[83:36.72]Shit, I'm dead.
[83:38.54]This is one guy left, I think.
[83:53.17]Give up, fuckface!
[84:04.74]Press the... I can't even see what that says.
[84:06.96]It's either... It's a button.
[84:08.20]Press the button to zoom your weapon.
[84:10.06]Right bumper.
[84:10.69]Okay.
[84:11.31]I just... I guessed.
[84:18.41]What?
[84:18.67]I just heard that guy's head off.
[84:21.87]What the fuck?
[84:27.13]Go to your car.
[84:27.82]Down the alley.
[84:28.38]Up...
[84:39.48]No, don't kill me!
[84:40.30]I'm just gonna walk out of here.
[84:41.40]That guy did it, not me.
[84:45.85]I need help.
[85:15.52]I have to complete the, okay, I got two objectives complete.
[85:17.78]Alright, I'll let him go.
[85:18.44]Get out of the way.
[85:19.72]Alright, get out of here.
[85:25.41]I'm not having 23, 24 murders.
[85:27.95]That was VR quality aiming right there.
[85:54.39]Come on!
[86:08.09]Use the key to open the garage door.
[86:09.27]They had fire extinguishers back then?
[86:20.10]Can I drive that car?
[86:21.08]Alright, come here.
[86:21.60]Give me the health.
[86:22.20]How do I open the door?
[86:24.06]Alright, watch out.
[86:24.90]I need to open this.
[86:25.36]I'm not gonna kill him.
[86:25.96]Just don't hurt the hostage!
[86:52.50]Okay.
[86:55.55]Alright, get out.
[86:56.55]Go!
[87:00.33]Whoa!
[87:01.35]Hold on, I need you again.
[87:03.01]Come here for a second.
[87:03.67]Why?! !
[87:22.10]Oh my god, okay.
[87:25.56]Just don't shoot the hostage.
[87:26.74]Leave the hostage.
[87:27.30]Don't shoot that hostage.
[87:28.56]Leave that hostage alone.
[87:29.80]I love the... There he is.
[87:32.22]Can't aim from here.
[87:53.59]What?
[87:53.79]Surrender immediately.
[87:55.21]I don't think so.
[87:56.13]We need health, though.
[87:56.89]If you're playing a hidden object game, it's called, can you even see the people down there?
[88:03.91]I can't.
[88:04.43]One guy left.
[88:05.15]Health?
[88:21.53]Health anywhere around here?
[88:22.85]I just don't want to do this all over again.
[88:25.51]Where's my car?
[88:26.03]Thank God.
[88:26.41]I'm in deep shit now.
[88:27.17]I gotta call Sean.
[88:45.17]Is he here?
[88:45.67]Oh, this is a double cross.
[88:46.95]Okay, cool.
[89:14.30]Get to your car, I got a new outfit.
[89:16.48]Some decals, a beanie.
[89:23.07]They didn't spend any time at all doing a double-cross scenario.
[89:29.49]Took them five minutes.
[89:38.28]Please don't play this for eight hours.
[89:40.08]I'll be lucky if I play this for eight more minutes.
[89:46.09]I just need to see.
[89:46.91]I'm trying to get out of the crew and they're coming after you.
[89:52.23]This is gonna make meeting Sean at your apartment more difficult.
[89:55.11]Head to your apartment, but try to avoid the police.
[90:01.43]You don't need to see any more of this.
[90:04.77]Can I get in a car?
[90:06.81]There's got to be a car sequence here.
[90:08.37]Get to your apartment quietly.
[90:18.68]Which one of these is mine?
[90:46.77]Did you not read?
[90:47.51]I know it said quietly, but I don't care.
[91:00.28]Get in there.
[91:00.98]Be quiet.
[91:04.29]I can't climb over that.
[91:23.14]It's pretty quiet.
[91:31.60]I'm going to give it one more time.
[91:42.19]One more time.
[91:42.71]One more.
[91:43.05]One more.
[91:43.39]One more.
[91:43.69]One more.
[91:44.07]One more.
[91:44.51]One more.
[91:44.83]That's it.
[92:01.46]Which one of these is mine?
[92:02.52]That?
[92:02.88]Is this one my apartment?
[92:06.56]It didn't really tell us which one it was.
[92:07.82]What?
[92:10.42]Stay off this chat?
[92:26.06]What are they doing?
[92:30.62]What, did I join the wrong Discord?
[92:41.06]What are you talking about?
[92:43.30]Can I go in this door?
[92:55.69]What's that stain on his shirt?
[92:58.01]What's that stain on... He's controlling someone.
[93:01.17]Did you hear that?
[93:08.00]He's Jedi mind tricking somebody.
[93:17.75]Can't go in there.
[93:19.77]No, I want... No, give me the other weapon.
[93:22.71]How do I cycle weapons?
[93:29.45]Stop screaming.
[93:30.21]How do I cycle weapons?
[93:51.05]I can't.
[93:52.93]There it is.
[93:53.35]Okay.
[94:03.00]wow oh my god oh my god this head was made in a paper mache that's not my fault
[94:41.27]Where is this guy?
[94:43.04]Who cares about stuff anymore?
[94:47.32]Which one is mine?
[94:47.98]27?
[94:48.00]28?
[94:48.02]29?
[94:48.06]How do you do this silently?
[94:49.90]Silently!
[94:50.18]That was weird. 30?
[95:19.69]That's a pretty good Orson Welles voice.
[95:24.07]It's probably at the end of this path.
[95:25.83]Yeah, I would assume it is.
[95:26.61]Did I say that or did somebody else say that?
[95:29.36]$900 TV?
[95:29.46]It was one of the offices.
[95:52.51]Can't stealth this.
[96:00.75]I'm gonna hit the button.
[96:10.44]Power button's going off if I die here.
[96:20.16]That was unbearable.
[96:21.64]Give me health.
[96:27.27]Alright, get in my apartment.
[96:28.01]It's probably this one with the light on it.
[96:31.65]Fifteen?
[96:32.07]Could've just opened it.
[96:35.31]Is this my house?
[96:40.88]Is this my bed?
[96:45.28]What am I supposed to do with this?
[97:01.70]At least the $900 TV.
[97:15.37]Uh... I guess we're just gonna keep going this way.
[97:21.44]I don't know.
[97:29.00]Building 4, apartment 25.
[97:31.18]So this is... It wasn't 30.
[97:32.28]It's up here.
[97:33.55]Where my girl at?
[97:38.57]Oye, mamabicho.
[97:39.53]I know what you got going down.
[97:40.59]You say you want out, then you take my fucking money?
[97:43.05]You want your family or that money?
[97:44.25]They'll be tied up in my basement until I get my cheddar.
[97:46.87]You have until noon tomorrow.
[97:49.13]Damn.
[97:50.41]I need to make a withdrawal.
[97:53.69]Apartment 25 to life.
[97:54.99]There he is.
[98:00.64]Who's shooting?
[98:03.76]What the hell is this?
[98:10.44]What is going on out here?
[98:33.43]Okay.
[98:34.59]No.
[98:37.39]He got up.
[98:38.83]He got up.
[98:39.21]He actually got up.
[98:39.91]No he didn't.
[98:43.72]How do I have a sniper rifle and I can't kill you from this far away?
[98:47.90]There's another one.
[98:48.94]He keeps coming back.
[98:50.32]This guy does not quit.
[98:53.24]And now you don't have a head anymore.
[98:57.61]There's gotta be health in my house.
[99:01.93]Anything else in here?
[99:07.69]What about... Okay, hold on.
[99:08.59]I need to make sure.
[99:09.18]What about my TV?
[99:10.06]What happened to my door?
[99:17.52]My TV sucks.
[99:26.06]Damn it.
[99:34.29]Can I take it?
[99:34.97]Can I swap it out?
[99:40.03]There's a first-person mode.
[99:47.40]Can I swap it with the... Okay.
[99:50.84]Now let's do this... Let's go with this.
[99:54.18]And I'm going to go with the back door.
[99:55.30]Okay.
[99:59.73]Oh!
[100:09.14]He's going to play this for eight hours.
[100:10.31]No, I'm not going to play.
[100:11.19]I'm just going to get to the car sequence where I can drive.
[100:12.87]It's going to be next.
[100:27.38]What's that?
[100:30.88]That looks like something I can interact with.
[100:37.24]Why can't I... What's up with coming back here?
[100:51.47]Return to your car.
[100:55.09]What was the point of being able to come behind here?
[101:09.50]Immersion.
[101:16.68]It's called World Immersion.
[101:25.23]There's a hole in the fence?
[101:34.87]You liar.
[101:37.46]Why?
[101:37.78]No, there's no hole in these...
[101:48.80]Oh my god, I couldn't even see it!
[101:50.44]How do you even see that?
[101:57.65]Get back to the car, and then let me drive it.
[102:07.21]You keep saying that.
[102:18.64]I'm dead.
[102:18.98]Why is it just a yellow button?
[102:49.00]Let's go.
[102:56.72]I would have to do that whole thing again.
[102:57.86]Alright, coming up next.
[103:02.83]I kind of need to... No, I can't play this one yet.
[103:10.63]I can't.
[103:16.14]This one is the 12-hour game.
[103:18.50]Oh, just let's do it.
[103:19.52]Fuck it.
[103:20.16]Put it in.
[103:23.86]This is without warning.
[103:25.02]This game has a 12-hour time limit on it.
[103:27.76]I can't do this one.
[103:29.50]I'm going to put it in.
[103:31.85]Hold on.
[103:32.33]Hold on.
[103:32.63]Hold on.
[103:33.09]Let me just take a piss.
[103:35.37]I'll be right back.
[103:37.35]First piss of the night.
[105:56.58]This is another Capcom game.
[105:57.68]We play a lot of Capcom games.
[106:02.65]I've noticed.
[106:06.49]I have 12 hours to beat this game.
[106:11.81]I read the back of the box.
[106:13.74]You have 12 hours.
[106:15.04]The clock is ticking.
[106:17.46]Play as six different characters and experience the game from each of their perspectives.
[106:20.54]Unique timeline element.
[106:27.62]I got 12 hours without warning.
[106:32.82]Let me mute so I don't blow your eardrums out opening this fresh beer.
[106:42.76]It's a Coke.
[106:43.22]Just kidding.
[106:43.68]Alright.
[106:47.06]English.
[106:49.84]Without warning.
[106:53.12]Welcome to the rest of the stream, everybody.
[107:00.35]Subtitles, make sure they're on.
[107:01.87]Let me just look at them.
[107:06.61]No vibration, please.
[107:07.67]Display.
[107:14.11]Screen brightness.
[107:15.11]It's probably just screen brightness.
[107:16.39]Here we go.
[107:18.59]I better hurry the fuck up.
[107:26.53]Circle Studio presents.
[107:33.64]You have twelve hours.
[107:34.84]I have nineteen hundred hours to beat this.
[107:36.66]What a life.
[107:37.18]Alright, I can relax.
[107:37.84]That's like three or four years.
[108:02.52]You don't see the knife?
[108:06.60]He was very clearly brandishing a knife.
[108:13.20]See, the counter is counting down.
[108:14.56]Secure, eliminate, protect it.
[108:15.84]Kyle Rivers.
[108:28.09]You're counting down?
[108:33.41]Let's go!
[108:35.29]Hey!
[108:37.61]Wow!
[108:38.23]Do not do that to your boss!
[108:39.63]Let me just make sure I make that really, really clear here.
[108:43.04]Don't touch your boss's face.
[108:45.12]Don't slap your boss in the fucking mouth.
[108:47.80]That's a quick way for you to get insta-fired.
[108:51.22]And potentially, like, charges pressed on you.
[108:55.72]Ah, yeah.
[108:56.60]Whatever you say.
[109:03.35]The little intelligence we have suggests they're led by Corbin Derbeck.
[109:07.87]He's prominent in the anti-capitalist movement, and although he's a French Canadian, he's been operating out of the Middle East for the last 20 years.
[109:15.93]I thought that lady was just peeing in the sink.
[109:26.00]So far, Derbeck has made no demands.
[109:28.52]We're getting a lot of different characters and names.
[109:30.52]We fear his intention might simply be to blow the plant.
[109:32.97]If he does, the explosion will kill everything and everyone in a two-mile radius.
[109:37.89]Oh no, not the anti-capitalist.
[109:40.41]We could be looking at over 300,000 civilian dead.
[109:44.15]He must be stopped.
[109:52.99]An executive order has been issued and verified.
[109:55.73]Corbin Derbeck is not to leave the plant alive.
[110:02.16]Here we go.
[110:05.70]20 hours.
[110:06.30]Wait, didn't I say I had, how many hours did I get?
[110:10.37]12 hours.
[110:11.23]You have 12 hours.
[110:12.07]Why do they, why do I have 20?
[110:14.61]This is command.
[110:15.23]Clear out the local area to establish...
[110:19.55]Why is it counting up?
[110:20.57]Should it be counting down?
[110:22.71]It's counting up!
[110:23.29]It's a clock!
[110:49.85]Yeah, but I thought it was supposed to be counting down 12 hours.
[110:52.97]Oh, it's inverted!
[111:07.42]I need to change that immediately.
[111:10.89]To move around, use the left analog stick.
[111:13.47]To move the camera, use the right analog stick.
[111:15.25]To raise your gun, hold the R1 button down lightly.
[111:19.27]To fire, hold the R1 button down firmly.
[111:30.86]Camera... No, just no inversion.
[111:35.92]Okay.
[111:38.52]Let's go.
[111:40.70]Don't change.
[111:41.64]This is bad.
[112:01.75]To lock onto an enemy, move the crosshair over them and then hold down L1 when it turns yellow.
[112:07.18]Nope, this is only available in standard mode.
[112:20.08]Are we in here?
[112:32.02]My eyes, for real.
[112:34.51]It's too zoomed in.
[112:36.63]This is the shark game again.
[112:37.65]I'm gonna throw up.
[112:39.03]It's gonna happen again.
[112:44.19]Jones, is the area secure?
[112:46.53]Looks clear.
[112:48.11]Fire in the hole, American!
[112:53.17]Fire in the whole America.
[112:55.49]It's in the whole America.
[113:20.64]All of America.
[113:26.78]We have no contingency, Rivers.
[113:28.66]It's down to you.
[113:30.10]Over.
[113:31.38]I need intel.
[113:32.44]Are we linked to the security cameras?
[113:34.99]We have a visual on the hostages.
[113:37.25]They're being held in the cracking towers.
[113:39.53]The doors may be locked down, but intel shows the lock controls are in the tunnel.
[113:44.71]Regan should be able to open them.
[113:46.95]Proceed with extreme pre- Rivers out.
[113:50.55]Okay.
[113:51.57]Now where do I go?
[113:53.37]How much health do I have?
[114:18.62]What is this?
[114:19.16]I already said 30 FPS.
[114:21.04]Like, 12 FPS with 30 FOV.
[114:24.98]How do I open that?
[114:26.44]Why does it zoom in?
[114:27.82]Can I just take it?
[114:29.88]How do I open this?
[114:34.56]What did I just...?
[114:35.90]Okay, that's grenade.
[114:41.33]Open medkit.
[115:09.16]Alright, I'm good.
[115:12.28]Alright, I admit, this is bad.
[115:25.39]Alright, this is really bad.
[115:29.31]I only have 11 hours and 49 more minutes to beat this.
[115:39.26]I only have eleven and a half more hours.
[115:46.34]Oh.
[115:52.97]Capcom made this, though.
[115:54.09]You know what I mean?
[115:54.53]Like, come on.
[115:55.01]Capcom... It's like a timed shooter.
[115:59.35]Give me some slack.
[116:00.25]It was worth a shot.
[116:13.96]total missing hostage statistics 41 total people missing was I supposed to save anybody Capcom made a bunch of shitty games during this era you know what you're right they did
[116:44.20]Now we're going to Jack Hooper, this twin... Might be time to get a good one in here.
[117:03.60]Might be time to put Freedom Fighters in.
[117:06.86]That's a good one.
[117:10.07]Command to Hooper.
[117:11.79]What's your status, over?
[117:13.94]Hot-swap the disk?
[117:14.30]What do you think will happen if I hot-swap the disk right now?
[117:16.84]Copy that!
[117:17.18]Copy that!
[117:17.82]Your map screen shows the route to any objectives you have complete.
[117:21.50]Press select button to access it.
[117:22.30]Is there a timer?
[117:23.52]No, there's no timer.
[117:45.05]There's no timer.
[117:46.95]To roll, hold down L1 and press X. Did I... I got baited to play this.
[117:56.54]What?
[117:56.72]There he is!
[117:57.40]Speed it up, come on!
[118:18.27]I think I'm dead.
[118:19.11]I'm going to hot swap the disk.
[118:30.21]There is just no countdown mechanic.
[118:36.77]Putting in Freedom Fighters.
[118:54.00]I gave up on that real quick.
[118:55.26]It was gonna make me sick.
[118:59.81]Okay, that's a- that happened.
[119:05.01]Is it actually possible to blue screen?
[119:09.40]At PlayStation 2?
[119:13.40]I'm surprised.
[119:22.74]Didn't even know that was possible.
[119:37.35]Trigger your console's nicely ungrateful streamer.
[119:42.78]It's fine.
[119:44.62]Challenge everything!
[119:59.71]Freedom Fighters.
[120:01.87]Now, this is a real game.
[120:08.53]I think we're essentially playing the last game that was just on the screen, but much better.
[120:25.66]You still love the multiplayer?
[120:26.90]Yeah.
[120:28.70]I don't think I've ever played it.
[120:39.83]Britain reluctantly joins the communist bloc.
[120:44.16]Despite U.S.
[120:44.74]protests, mid-range nuclear missiles are placed in Cuba.
[120:49.42]World War III.
[121:00.59]Uh, the Mexican Communist Party celebrates disputed victory in presidential election.
[121:05.22]What happens in 2004?
[121:06.10]Uh oh.
[121:12.06]In 2004, World War III erupts.
[121:15.60]Yesterday, reports of low-flying drones from all over the USA government dismisses the sightings as weather balloons.
[121:31.14]Hey, you know what?
[121:31.78]I gotta give them a little bit of credit here.
[121:34.32]That could have easily had been, like, 2006.
[121:35.66]No, no.
[121:38.28]Yesterday could be at any point.
[121:39.76]That was 2000, 1999.
[121:40.38]This could take place in 2019, right?
[121:43.42]It's a timeless game now.
[122:15.78]Submarines are so cool.
[122:17.04]Holy shit.
[122:21.29]Heck yeah, they kind of are.
[122:25.05]Submarines are so cool.
[122:32.73]Alright, I'm ready.
[122:36.15]Jermo, you're a nerd.
[122:38.23]That's alright.
[122:39.87]That's fine with me.
[122:50.37]Checking memory card.
[122:51.45]Uh, yes.
[122:56.06]Just make sure we got some stuff selected.
[122:57.70]Uh, video.
[123:01.22]Get this shit in widescreen.
[123:08.20]Uh-oh.
[123:10.54]My screen's too big.
[123:24.07]16 by 9 Sound What are you doing?
[123:33.55]Don't turn the music down!
[123:45.94]Choose difficulty.
[123:47.64]This is important.
[123:49.22]Demonstrator.
[123:49.84]A walk in the park.
[123:50.76]Rebel.
[123:51.02]Have a blast.
[123:51.54]Freedom fighter.
[123:52.10]You got what it takes.
[123:52.88]Revolutionary.
[123:53.50]Against all odds.
[123:55.82]So this is easy, normal, hard, and impossible.
[123:59.80]I'm gonna go with normal.
[124:00.66]I'm a rebel.
[124:01.38]Have a blast.
[124:06.78]Uh, what's my name?
[124:11.60]Oh, man.
[124:17.47]No, no, no, no, no.
[124:18.87]Delete.
[124:22.19]He's playing on easy mode.
[124:24.83]This is not easy mode.
[124:28.13]This is the normal difficulty.
[125:06.87]Who cares?
[125:07.37]Tom.
[125:12.50]Tom.
[125:27.31]I'm not playing on easy.
[125:29.57]I'm playing on normal.
[125:36.72]Name it, that face when propaganda.
[125:40.86]Anyway, when I couldn't pinpoint the exact location of my humble summer cottage in the Hamptons, she dropped me right there.
[125:48.41]60 FPS, yeah.
[125:50.53]Damn, I look like an idiot, still holding the drinks I've been paying for all night.
[125:54.78]Well, who cares?
[125:55.48]You know, her loss.
[125:57.02]He popped the clutch, so let's get on with it.
[125:59.63]What's up with the work seat today, bro?
[126:01.41]Hmm, let's see.
[126:03.51]Isabella Angelina.
[126:04.91]A condo in Midtown Manhattan.
[126:06.99]Drain plug and a leaky garbage disposal.
[126:10.45]Do we have to get the crappiest route every Monday morning?
[126:14.94]I wish for once we'd get a fancy condo on the east side with a view.
[126:19.10]Whoa.
[126:20.20]Isabella Angel-whatever.
[126:22.02]She's that hot spokes-babe for the Warning Against Reds movement?
[126:26.30]I saw her on TV yesterday.
[126:29.71]No idea.
[126:30.97]Besides, I don't follow all that conspiracy crap like you do.
[126:34.91]What do you mean, conspiracy crap?
[126:37.39]Doesn't the Soviet invasion of South America bother you?
[126:41.21]You need a reality check, bro.
[126:42.75]Know what?
[126:43.45]Next thing you know, you'll be waking up under a Russian flag and you won't think it's conspiracy crap then.
[126:49.18]Right.
[126:51.27]You're so in denial.
[126:53.29]Look, try listening to those warning against reds guys.
[126:55.57]Speaking of which, how about this risk?
[126:57.85]Are we painters?
[126:58.63]I'd really like to check out the plumbing on that Isabella check.
[127:00.82]Oh, plumbers.
[127:03.68]Hello?
[127:05.26]Plumbers on patrol.
[127:07.96]Anybody home?
[127:11.22]No wonder.
[127:13.48]Sister Sludge sure needs a trained surgeon here.
[127:17.72]I was right!
[127:18.48]I was right!
[127:18.80]I was right!
[127:20.20]That was a meaty punch.
[127:21.84]That backhand.
[127:46.69]That guy had a really wet face.
[127:47.93]That was a wet slap.
[127:50.11]Can I play as this guy?
[128:02.34]Manhattan Invasion.
[128:05.22]Okay.
[128:06.38]Let's go.
[128:08.10]So this is a retelling of if World War 3 happened, right?
[128:12.78]Let me read the back of the box.
[128:13.72]I don't have a back of the box.
[128:14.74]It just came as a single disk.
[128:23.96]I have a wrench?
[128:31.70]So I'm actually playing as the plumber.
[128:33.47]Alright, let's go.
[128:38.25]Who's talking?
[128:42.35]Oh, this guy.
[128:42.69]Alright.
[128:52.85]Nice reaction time.
[128:54.55]That was unbelievable.
[128:55.17]You're the one leading.
[128:57.30]Go ahead.
[128:58.42]Get the guy up there.
[129:21.72]Oh, no, I'm out of bullets.
[129:23.14]We must leave now!
[129:25.52]Can I pick up, okay, bullets on the ground?
[129:27.10]How do you reload a gun?
[129:39.38]See those soldiers down there?
[129:41.28]We are not as well supplied as the enemy, so we'll have to improvise.
[129:44.80]L3 is aimed.
[129:45.46]Aim at the fuel barrels rather than the soldiers.
[129:53.21]That, whoop, buh-bye.
[129:55.55]That was kind of a half second delay there.
[129:56.97]I think I did like a full flip.
[130:01.56]Um, was I supposed to get hit by that much?
[130:03.00]I just got a bomb dropped on me.
[130:05.50]Got it.
[130:07.78]How do I use it?
[130:10.08]I'll R3 to bring up the inventory and then select the med kit with the left analog stick and just let it go, I'm assuming.
[130:15.74]Yep.
[130:16.84]And then R1.
[130:20.86]We're not out of the woods yet.
[130:22.64]It's us or Ben.
[130:24.02]Alonger.
[130:34.87]Where we going?
[130:41.59]So this is... Don't... Vodana took a swing at me.
[130:47.62]Oh, come here.
[130:48.42]He's wounded!
[130:49.58]You have a health pack.
[130:50.88]Save this man's life.
[130:52.06]Do I get to have, like, a blue member?
[130:53.98]I guess I owe you one, pal.
[130:55.68]What's our status?
[130:57.22]Okay, come with me, guys.
[130:58.22]I've got supplies that'll get us out of this mess.
[130:59.75]Plus 25 charisma.
[131:00.17]Do you have stat points in this game?
[131:03.05]Where'd they go?
[131:10.79]I don't know where they went.
[131:12.11]They went too fast.
[131:12.79]Okay.
[131:14.35]Grab a Molotov.
[131:15.29]Let's show the Reds!
[131:17.21]Okay, press and hold R3, so it's just like Red Dead Redemption.
[131:26.07]Where would you like me to throw it?
[131:33.80]Over here?
[131:34.10]That was a big throw.
[131:39.70]You actually have to do a jump shot.
[131:44.93]Is there any more?
[131:45.49]I think I did that so well, the game doesn't understand that I got them all in one throw.
[131:49.93]Let's get the pistol back out.
[131:58.36]Who's he shooting at?
[132:05.00]Stand up.
[132:08.38]No time to waste.
[132:09.64]They'll be back if we don't hurry.
[132:14.77]You get to control a whole army, somebody said.
[132:16.72]Really?
[132:18.80]It's kind of chunky.
[132:23.63]It's alright.
[132:24.57]It's a little crusty, but you can have a little bit of crust.
[132:28.97]How does opening a manhole give me more charisma?
[132:45.97]Because it's scary down there.
[132:50.07]Can I get out of my plumber outfit?
[132:56.06]It's a warp pipe.
[132:57.22]Citizens of New York and comrades from the Soviet Armed Forces, welcome to our first news broadcast after today's events.
[133:06.42]My name is Tatyana Kempinski, and I will be your regular news anchor from now on.
[133:12.43]Like small yellow sponge man.
[133:13.39]The kids that live on street next door to you.
[133:33.56]Our Soviet leaders have been concerned for years by the plight of the poor American people suffering under a corrupt regime.
[133:39.73]Today, we have finally succeeded in liberating the suppressed masses of Americans from further hardship, and we will soon restore law and order in a new rule of government.
[133:49.63]And we expect and believe that every citizen will swear allegiance to this new order.
[133:54.06]Cooperate, and you will reap all the benefits of the Soviet system.
[133:57.86]All measure of resistance will be futile and dealt with swiftly.
[134:01.50]Our great leader, Comrade General Tatarin, will be addressing the nation later.
[134:06.95]So on behalf of the dedicated staff here at the studio and the glorious Soviet Armed Forces, welcome New York to a better future.
[134:24.20]That was an easy invasion.
[134:41.60]So we live down in the sewers.
[134:43.51]We make an army in the sewer and then we come back up and we fight.
[134:48.77]What game is this?
[134:58.16]It's called Freedom Fighters.
[134:59.28]This is the HQ.
[135:12.78]The Brooklyn Rebel Base.
[135:21.97]To enter a location, go to the map and press X. This is our base.
[135:28.34]It's a safe zone.
[135:29.66]We store equipment here.
[135:31.80]With complete control of the sewer system, the tunnels enable us to bypass many of the Soviet roadblocks.
[135:37.70]Interesting.
[135:38.46]All of our maps will indicate the location of the sewer access points.
[135:42.90]Let us go over to the table and take a look at the map.
[135:49.10]Police station and post office.
[135:52.35]Okay, what about, like, the post office?
[135:54.85]The post office is a Soviet stronghold.
[135:57.17]It's a Soviet stronghold.
[136:00.53]Your brother is being held somewhere inside.
[136:03.15]Raise your flag on the roof to signal our victory.
[136:05.99]To get near the police station, you'll have to destroy a sniper's nest on the gas station.
[136:11.23]Okay.
[136:12.09]Destroy sniper's nest on gas station.
[136:17.19]Raise your flag on the roof to signal victory.
[136:20.29]To get to the police station, you'll have to destroy the sniper's nest on the gas station.
[136:25.90]Destroy gas station and raise flag on post office.
[136:28.04]Alright.
[136:39.72]They're going to send a plumber to go assault a Soviet stronghold.
[136:43.30]Yeah.
[136:57.69]From plumber to sniper elite in two steps.
[137:00.43]Alright, here we go.
[137:10.26]Is that a, is this a bad guy?
[137:11.68]No, no, I see the red, white, and blue.
[137:15.78]What's up?
[137:16.64]Find a manhole, press X, and select another location.
[137:33.88]So I have to go... I need to get explosives.
[137:35.72]So I gotta go to the other... I gotta go to the other neighborhood.
[137:39.88]So I gotta go to the... Find a manhole.
[137:40.70]Then we gotta go to another location.
[137:41.76]Uh, maybe not.
[138:04.40]To the same one!
[138:08.36]He didn't have one right next to him or anything.
[138:09.46]Alright, well let's just go.
[138:13.73]Do I actually have to go back to the warp pipe and go to the other location?
[138:25.54]Do I have to go to the police station?
[138:30.32]Well, I didn't know if it wanted me to do that now.
[138:32.66]I can't just go explore?
[138:37.77]So, how do I select another one?
[138:43.95]Secure the police station and liberate our leader, Isabella.
[138:47.50]Raise your flag to signal her release.
[138:50.24]The police officers will assist you, but they need your help taking out snipers on the nearby gas station.
[138:56.54]I can't select any of these other sewers.
[138:58.80]I'm on that one, but the ones in the middle I can't select.
[139:03.34]Your brother is being held somewhere inside.
[139:05.97]Raise your...
[139:08.41]I can go to the police station.
[139:25.34]If the police station is the other location, that's the only other one I have.
[139:35.77]I thought you guys were talking about, like, I need to pick a different sewer in the post office one.
[139:44.05]I knew I could go to the police station.
[139:45.19]I just didn't know if I could select the other sewers, manholes.
[139:49.31]Alright, let's go.
[139:59.80]So, looking for explosives in the other neighborhood here.
[140:04.25]Is there any stealth in this game?
[140:05.05]Should I be worried about stealth?
[140:07.71]Or just kind of go?
[140:11.37]No, these are... Okay, these are just cops.
[140:17.01]Alright, C4.
[140:17.53]Why?
[140:17.85]Who just shot me in the head?
[140:21.52]What?
[140:21.62]Hey!
[140:21.76]Hey!
[140:43.57]I'm just a fucking plumber!
[140:56.27]Approach!
[140:56.79]I didn't know that... I was gonna insta-die?
[141:08.76]We're like standing in the same spot.
[141:17.92]Okay, so the tiny little window right there, do not move.
[141:21.14]But I have to pick up the C4.
[141:23.10]Alright, I'm fucking ducking.
[141:27.36]Grab the C4.
[141:29.58]Find a manhole and select another location.
[141:34.19]So I have to go to the other... So that's an explosive.
[141:37.17]Got it.
[141:41.61]So I'm just abandoning them.
[141:45.12]I just took their ammunition and am leaving.
[141:53.87]See you later.
[142:03.88]What an asshole.
[142:04.56]Yeah, really.
[142:14.69]The Bowstarvers.
[142:22.81]Oh, I blow up the sniper's nest.
[142:25.40]Oh, would you look at that?
[142:31.02]So that's the, somebody said the gimmick is you just gotta bounce back and forth between levels and it's a RPG shooter puzzle.
[142:39.08]You do.
[142:39.37]I have the explosives now.
[142:43.83]Everything's interlinked.
[142:47.99]Alright, blow the gas station, you got it.
[142:51.03]Let's go.
[142:52.75]Alright, holding in the left thumbstick and moving right stick is kind of...
[143:22.67]Where's the other guy?
[143:26.10]Okay, saw it, rifle.
[143:27.12]Wait... Where was he?
[143:33.34]Did he come out of the trash?
[143:35.04]What the fuck?
[143:36.26]Okay.
[143:47.90]Uh... That might be a good guy.
[143:52.60]No way, pal.
[143:53.96]No one gets by until Isabella is free.
[143:58.71]Okay, so now I gotta remember this spot.
[144:03.21]At least there's no... Oh, look!
[144:05.83]A new sewer.
[144:12.04]So now I've unlocked the sewer now.
[144:16.62]Let me just look at something here.
[144:17.56]Post office.
[144:18.14]Can I?
[144:18.50]No.
[144:19.42]No.
[144:22.61]Bonfire lit.
[144:23.29]Nothing else I can do over here.
[144:29.45]What about the guy behind the fence?
[144:33.25]Can I talk to him?
[144:38.10]I guess not.
[144:38.48]You can save it.
[144:42.92]I'll save it right now.
[144:48.04]Are you sure you want a quick save?
[144:49.20]Yep.
[144:52.44]What is the name of this shitty game?
[144:54.58]Hey!
[144:56.22]Whoa.
[145:00.20]Hey!
[145:05.23]It's Freedom Fighters.
[145:08.71]Can I go through here?
[145:13.53]Let's take a look.
[145:18.78]Is there another... I know there's a crouch.
[145:22.44]Gas station, gonna blow that up.
[145:24.11]Another sewer.
[145:27.75]They seem kind of in the... What's the purpose of having three of these sewers right here?
[145:38.83]As save points?
[145:44.43]Does he even have Ape Escape?
[145:47.33]I do not have it here, but eventually probably gonna get it.
[145:56.10]Alright, what we got?
[145:59.36]Place C4 explosive, walk to the base of the large fuel tanks and press X. Uh-huh.
[146:18.02]I thought it was gas.
[146:19.08]I thought it was the tanks.
[146:20.14]The gas ex... You know what I'm saying?
[146:22.06]These are on a timer.
[146:24.85]Oh god.
[146:31.13]Snipers have been eliminated from the gas tank.
[146:32.95]Now we can go back and help the officers, right?
[146:43.04]That doesn't explode?
[146:43.70]Alright, now let's go back.
[146:48.33]No, wait, wait, raise the flag, raise the flag.
[146:54.73]On top?
[146:57.95]How does one get on top?
[147:03.90]How do I get up there?
[147:04.48]No, I don't have to do that.
[147:08.18]That's in the other place, right?
[147:22.11]uh which one was it secure the police station and liberate our leader here we go just play wolfenstein
[147:51.67]Who said that was a Bernie Sanders voice?
[148:02.11]Alright, let's see.
[148:02.87]Now what?
[148:04.45]You gonna join me?
[148:05.23]Join my team?
[148:15.92]I helped.
[148:17.90]You're the only one left.
[148:18.66]That's not good.
[148:20.51]Thanks, friend.
[148:21.61]Nice to get rid of the snipers.
[148:23.13]Listen, if you're going to infiltrate the police station, I recommend you use the subway tunnel.
[148:27.91]You can maybe go around more bullshit.
[148:30.19]Subway tunnel.
[148:30.97]Okay, well, there we go.
[148:32.09]You mean this thing right here.
[148:34.82]Wait, hold on.
[148:40.60]Okay, I just want to do it.
[148:46.86]I'm going to come out here.
[148:47.50]He's going to go, you made it.
[148:53.79]No, alright.
[148:55.87]Well, that... Did not expect it to be right here.
[148:59.50]Alright, I only have... I have no bullets.
[149:02.86]Ugh!
[149:20.17]actually still, I have no, what can I, I don't have, I have to wrench these guys.
[149:24.69]I can molotov.
[149:25.37]I have ten molotovs, what?
[149:33.23]That hit perfectly in a place where I can't hit them.
[149:38.35]Come on, just lean into it.
[149:50.66]Give me a bolt.
[149:52.66]Dead.
[149:53.86]Give me that.
[150:05.79]Give me, give me, give me.
[150:11.53]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[150:14.19]Hide.
[150:14.41]Hide.
[150:27.73]Nice.
[150:29.22]Any more people in the hallway?
[150:34.78]Got a med kit.
[150:35.40]They can't even talk.
[150:42.22]No bullets in anything?
[150:43.03]Alright, let's go.
[150:46.59]And the game auto-aims.
[150:47.49]It just snaps to people.
[150:55.17]Ammo's kind of scarce in this game.
[151:02.64]Why are you standing here?
[151:03.76]Enter the police station through the parking garage, but stay low, or the soldiers will spot you.
[151:28.06]Why didn't you do... What have you been doing?
[151:29.94]Okay.
[151:30.16]Parking garage.
[151:30.78]Stay low.
[151:31.28]Stay low!
[151:31.62]Mmm... I gotta go through here.
[151:32.56]Can I just headshot this guy?
[152:13.98]Okay.
[152:20.55]There's a million people here.
[152:22.15]How am I going to do this?
[152:23.23]I have to get in through the parking garage, but the parking garage is closed.
[152:32.36]What the hell are you doing?
[152:37.24]They're looking for me.
[152:43.03]Oh, shit!
[152:48.97]No, this.
[152:49.85]No, this!
[152:50.39]That's not fair, you went through the fucking wall.
[153:00.12]Not fair, you went through the goddamn wall.
[153:04.66]What am I talking to?
[153:12.29]That's not fair!
[153:14.62]You hacker!
[153:20.32]Okay.
[153:20.60]So I gotta go down there.
[153:42.78]Stay low, stay low I went the right way the first time What about any other weapons or guns down here?
[154:03.70]Swap weapons, this is a shotgun
[154:08.27]I feel like I don't want to use... Maybe.
[154:09.75]We'll try it.
[154:11.77]Can I do that with the pistol, though?
[154:16.82]No, I can't.
[154:18.76]Only one slot.
[154:22.32]That's unfortunate.
[154:30.86]Are we talking politics in the chat?
[154:32.12]That's a banned topic.
[154:33.44]We don't talk politics here.
[154:39.63]I better not be seeing any politics in this chat.
[154:51.30]Well.
[154:52.46]There's some stuff in here.
[154:56.86]This game is politics?
[154:58.00]This is not even- This is fake politics!
[155:02.09]That's like saying when you watch 24, it's, uh, that's politics.
[155:08.51]This is fiction!
[155:18.04]Holy fuck.
[155:21.54]Oh, fuck.
[155:22.50]I'll tell you, for a PlayStation 2 game, the shooting is actually kind of fun.
[155:35.89]The guy up here.
[155:50.30]Where are they?
[155:50.64]Outside?
[155:54.40]What?
[155:54.76]Come on!
[156:03.09]Come on!
[156:05.17]Got it.
[156:06.87]I'm getting killed, though.
[156:07.99]You want to play this on a harder difficulty?
[156:09.51]Strange.
[156:09.87]Alright.
[156:10.31]I need to heal.
[156:24.22]So I gotta get up to the roof.
[156:34.24]Alright, dead.
[156:36.32]Anybody else?
[156:36.80]Health pack.
[156:37.60]I'm getting the hang of this.
[156:59.32]I'm gonna go up some more.
[157:00.26]I gotta plant the flag on the ceiling.
[157:09.10]Just go up!
[157:09.90]Just don't even stop!
[157:12.30]Why would I stop?
[157:13.42]Oh, that's why.
[157:16.50]Because I can't go up any further than this.
[157:25.07]Nope, nope!
[157:27.61]Computer?
[157:30.01]Solitaire?
[157:30.49]Was Solitaire in another video game, or is it this one?
[157:35.67]Are we still in the same game?
[157:38.35]We are, right?
[157:44.80]You had 60 ammo for the shotgun and you're already out.
[157:48.36]Yeah, because these guys take three hits.
[157:52.22]Well, one.
[157:52.56]I lied.
[157:59.57]Holy fucking jeez!
[158:01.75]What the... Where is he?
[158:10.47]To the right?
[158:15.42]Help me.
[158:19.80]Who said that?
[158:20.22]Somebody in here?
[158:21.72]Oh, that's Isabella!
[158:27.68]Go to the flag and press X to hoist the stars and stripes.
[158:32.00]Here we go.
[158:38.92]That's all I have to do.
[158:39.64]You have to just put up your flag and then they'll have to leave.
[158:44.50]Oh!
[158:45.14]He put up flag.
[158:46.84]Let's go home.
[158:49.16]There are 200 of us down here.
[158:52.58]This is the equivalent of playing, like, Call of Duty online.
[159:10.25]This is our building, it has our name on it, don't you see?
[159:12.57]No, you destabilize their economy first, then raise your flag.
[159:26.76]Alright, now I've got three people here.
[159:30.18]Excellent work demolishing the fuel station.
[159:33.16]We're able to move around at our leisure now that the snipers are gone.
[159:40.06]Okay.
[159:42.24]Got any of that?
[159:42.74]Okay, so we got police station, post office now.
[159:44.66]So we need to raise the flag on the post office.
[159:47.42]So... To get near the police station, your brother is being held, so I just gotta go to the post office.
[160:14.43]That doesn't sound anything like Bernie.
[160:20.26]I mean, it kind of does.
[160:26.30]It's not perfect, but it sounds similar.
[160:28.48]Alright, so we now have Isabel.
[160:43.53]Get my shotty.
[160:50.54]Yeah, see, now this guy's like, yeah, I'll let you in now.
[160:52.50]LOL.
[160:53.12]Alright, you lead the way.
[161:14.04]This is only a temporary base.
[161:15.72]We're using it as a staging place for this mission.
[161:18.41]Staging.
[161:18.91]Let's plan for our next move.
[161:20.41]What?
[161:20.95]You alright?
[161:21.25]You okay?
[161:22.07]You should probably sit down.
[161:23.69]You need a glass of water.
[161:44.06]Get flag on top of their flag.
[161:45.16]I'm playing Operation and I'm hitting the sides.
[162:12.51]I'll let you lead two of my best men into action.
[162:15.49]God damn it, the funny bone doesn't go there.
[162:17.55]Walk up to each of the freedom fighters and press X to recruit them.
[162:23.01]Let's go.
[162:23.43]Roger that.
[162:25.01]Let's roll.
[162:27.59]I can't touch anything.
[162:28.81]Fall in.
[162:29.33]You got it.
[162:30.13]They'll never know what hit them.
[162:31.90]Who's shooting at us?
[162:32.44]Get that guy!
[162:32.80]No, wait, wait, wait, how do I- wait.
[162:34.03]Hold on, wait.
[162:55.83]We're taking fire!
[162:56.69]Hit the deck!
[162:58.15]Wait, stop moving!
[162:59.21]Regroup!
[162:59.79]Moving out.
[163:00.49]Where's the other guy?
[163:01.39]Regroup!
[163:02.45]Where did the other guy go?
[163:04.94]Alright, what the fuck are we supposed to do?
[163:11.92]Defend this area.
[163:12.90]Okay, that's defend.
[163:14.86]I'll be right here.
[163:16.62]Scout that area.
[163:17.26]There's also scout?
[163:18.10]Check over there.
[163:19.32]Let's see what's around here.
[163:23.29]You guys did a good job.
[163:57.26]Very fast.
[163:58.04]Alright, because I don't know how the hell to get out of this building.
[164:01.56]Jesus!
[164:01.82]Stop, please!
[164:31.11]Go fight.
[164:32.81]I can't.
[164:33.46]Is he dead?
[164:34.16]One of these die.
[164:34.92]I have to relax.
[164:35.44]Where's the other squad member?
[164:59.79]Okay.
[165:07.07]Was that a bad guy?
[165:11.68]Can we... I think we can finally get out of this nonsense of the buzzing.
[165:18.56]So we have to go up here.
[165:20.76]Can I get through this way?
[165:21.61]What button is that?
[165:27.73]Okay, this is where we're standing.
[165:28.64]We gotta get to the post office.
[165:29.60]Got it.
[165:31.46]That guy just walked into the barrel and didn't die.
[165:32.98]There's too many fucking landmines here.
[165:34.80]I don't have any health.
[166:01.03]Let's take them out.
[166:01.91]Get them.
[166:05.42]Take them out.
[166:06.48]Take them down.
[166:08.20]Get them.
[166:09.08]Eliminate them.
[166:10.44]Bring it on.
[166:11.46]Hit their position.
[166:18.23]Look at that guy.
[166:35.50]Uh-oh.
[166:42.62]Oops.
[166:53.01]Touchdown.
[166:56.04]Didn't save.
[166:56.76]I'm right here.
[167:03.78]He's standing behind the explosive barrels.
[167:09.86]Well, he can't really not stand behind them.
[167:11.92]They're everywhere.
[167:12.68]Oh, shit.
[167:15.40]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[167:16.50]Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
[167:33.11]Let us in.
[167:37.83]Open, open.
[167:43.39]Yeah.
[167:44.21]I know what happened.
[167:46.07]These are the friends.
[167:46.75]We gotta go back up.
[167:48.53]Okay, I gotta save this time.
[167:49.91]Goddammit.
[167:53.89]This is only a temporary base.
[167:55.57]We're using it as a staging place for this mission.
[167:59.33]Nice holster.
[168:01.97]Velcroed on my back.
[168:04.29]This game's kind of fun.
[168:13.68]I don't know if this is a 12 hour stream kind of fun, but it's still fun to play.
[168:19.65]Freedom fighter.
[168:23.91]Here we have an overview of the enemy compound.
[168:26.77]You can see them unloading equipment.
[168:28.33]Yep.
[168:28.99]They're using this post office as a temporary command center and planning further advances into the city from here.
[168:34.68]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[168:35.36]Let me do, I gotta beat this mission.
[168:36.26]It would really set them back if we recaptured this area.
[168:39.88]You won't be alone.
[168:41.58]Ever since you proved yourself by rescuing me.
[168:43.54]I am the story.
[168:44.28]People are starting to believe in you.
[168:45.65]There's a PC version.
[168:49.71]That's pretty sweet.
[168:52.61]I'll let you lead two of my best men into action.
[168:55.25]Let's go.
[168:56.07]You know where to go?
[168:57.09]That way.
[168:57.79]Get them!
[168:58.24]As long as they're recruited.
[169:00.72]These guys will follow you wherever you go.
[169:03.06]Just like bodyguards.
[169:05.72]Wait, hold back, hold back, hold back.
[169:07.16]Is there a... I need to save in a sewer.
[169:09.28]Recruit?
[169:09.82]I'm bleeding bad!
[169:18.87]Why do I, like, help this guy?
[169:20.29]I need a save point.
[169:21.31]Goddammit.
[169:43.01]Alright, hold back.
[169:43.55]I'm just gonna shoot the red.
[169:44.17]That didn't do anything.
[169:45.17]Take them, skin.
[169:45.49]Hit them.
[170:18.16]Fuck I need bullets Stop doing that noise Who's on my team?
[170:39.30]Check over there
[170:46.48]I can't handle the noise.
[170:48.78]I don't have any medkits either.
[170:55.93]It's a hearing test.
[170:58.97]It really does sound like a hearing test.
[171:01.37]Any of you guys have a medkit?
[171:10.15]I have to go this way.
[171:11.67]Search over there.
[171:12.59]Scout ahead.
[171:14.71]Detect and report.
[171:16.65]Remember to check the map once in a while.
[171:18.94]I know.
[171:19.32]On the map, you can see the mission objectives.
[171:24.58]It's easy to get lost, so use the map to... Stop it!
[171:31.50]It might make life easier.
[171:46.79]Get in there.
[171:49.03]I'm gonna die.
[171:50.87]The sound is killing me.
[172:03.38]I can't, I'm sorry.
[172:08.72]We gotta change.
[172:09.26]There's a PC version?
[172:18.18]I gotta change.
[172:18.78]I'm sorry, that noise is gonna haunt me.
[172:22.60]Alright, I hope you guys are ready.
[172:35.70]for me to, uh, put in a game that I think we're gonna be on for a while.
[172:43.86]We're gonna play PsyOps, The Mindgate Conspiracy.
[172:46.27]Damn, I wanna, like, keep playing that, too.
[172:50.43]Just, like, I couldn't.
[172:52.27]I was feeling that buzz in my teeth.
[173:12.83]Is it because I blue-screened?
[173:14.29]No.
[173:15.21]I wasn't doing it for the first, like, 30-40 minutes we were in that game.
[173:33.26]Uh, this is one of the most requested games for the PlayStation 2.
[173:38.15]Vive Waiting Room!
[173:56.04]Like, you don't get to eat fucking cake every day, okay?
[174:01.64]You gotta eat vegetables and, like, meat.
[174:03.64]You don't just eat strawberry ice cream every day.
[174:20.30]Okay, let's see.
[174:21.28]There's special features.
[174:22.24]We gotta check that out first.
[174:33.23]It's a music video.
[174:55.57]Is this gonna be, like, the license, like, Batman Forever?
[174:59.67]They just put in... Oh my god.
[175:02.35]Yeah, it is.
[175:06.38]Seal, kiss from a rose.
[175:08.12]They just put in Batman Forever movie clips.
[175:10.82]Is that supposed to be the main character of PsyOps?
[175:50.39]Um, I had enough of that.
[175:51.35]PsyOps, the Mind Gate conspiracy.
[175:56.09]What is the extra content?
[175:58.75]Cooperative play.
[175:59.67]Alright, I'm ready.
[176:06.98]I was watching that.
[176:07.98]Yeah, well, now nobody after the stream's over is gonna be watching it.
[176:16.20]Elite, elite, elite.
[176:17.48]No, no!
[176:19.35]These are PlayStation 2 games, man.
[176:20.99]They're hard as shit.
[176:23.33]Here's your man, Nick Scryer.
[176:37.57]Facial reconstruction and memory.
[176:40.29]Intelligence has the movement attacking the refinery in about 90 hours from now.
[176:45.17]We're ready when he is.
[176:46.85]This memory wipe will give us plenty of time to drop him in.
[176:49.15]Oh, spooky's scary.
[176:50.51]Mindgate's specialty is science.
[176:55.33]I've done some homework on Mindgate.
[176:58.18]Your boy's got quite a reputation, and it's not all good.
[177:02.20]Okay, he's no Boy Scout, but Nick Skryer is Mindgate's best.
[177:07.12]They dismissed General Krieger, but Skryer stayed with Mindgate and took his psychic powers.
[177:11.91]Look at all that guy's hands.
[177:12.87]He's got, like, lizard hands.
[177:13.85]One minute.
[177:29.12]Like, ripping people's heads off.
[177:33.74]Oh, we're getting coxed.
[177:41.62]Yeah, we are.
[177:42.66]Unfortunately.
[177:50.00]So that was like 30 years ago.
[177:52.06]Fast forward into 20 years ago.
[178:04.11]No, no, no, no, no, that, that... Okay, I thought... Didn't I see a flashback of this?
[178:22.38]I did.
[178:30.77]The littering.
[178:31.81]That's what you get for throwing a cigarette into the ocean.
[178:36.23]Don't do that shit.
[178:39.11]Think of the fish down there.
[178:40.13]They're gonna have to smell that tobacco.
[178:43.37]Dispose of your cigarettes in a timely manner.
[178:45.97]In an ashtray, and throw the ashtray into a trash bag, and then tie the trash bag up and throw the trash bag in the trash.
[178:55.61]First contact?
[178:59.38]Blood porn?
[179:14.88]Wow.
[179:16.84]Did he throw the bazooka?
[179:20.44]I only had one bullet in there.
[179:22.14]We don't have any more.
[179:23.82]Just throw it.
[179:53.32]Gnome.
[179:55.14]What do you mean gnome?
[180:00.97]I'm not a gnuke?
[180:03.27]What?
[180:03.65]I didn't even see it.
[180:22.44]I'm not a nuke.
[180:24.62]Ugh.
[180:39.17]Alright, what the hell are you guys doing?
[180:49.46]Oh, Vive waiting room, huh?
[180:51.97]What about this one?
[180:53.79]The movement, the movement, the movement, the movement.
[181:21.89]That's a lot of medals.
[181:22.75]Did I get it?
[181:23.87]I got the gun?
[181:24.57]Who's doing this?
[181:55.28]No, that's my friend Take this one to solitary
[182:21.53]I forgot that the Oscars are tonight.
[182:32.22]Are they?
[182:38.02]Who's even nominated?
[182:38.90]I know Willem Dafoe is.
[182:56.00]Bird Box is gonna win Best Meme Movie.
[183:24.86]Meet up at the supply room.
[183:25.92]Uh, why would she kick you in the nuts?
[183:27.74]Stealth.
[183:53.00]Can I do anything else?
[183:54.47]Push the L3 button towards a wall or object for wall move.
[184:00.29]Okay, wall move.
[184:02.43]Just need to check it out and see how it works.
[184:19.51]Crouch.
[184:36.40]I think I need to... Is there a sensitivity option?
[184:40.10]No, it auto-locks.
[184:41.12]Okay.
[184:43.36]I kicked that.
[184:44.08]I need to stand up.
[185:01.45]Give me that gun.
[185:04.04]Soldiers drop their weapons when killed.
[185:05.20]Weapons can be picked up.
[185:09.41]Okay.
[185:14.21]Anybody in here?
[185:16.49]Do I get to store the med kit?
[185:24.82]Inventory.
[185:26.28]Select to access inventory.
[185:27.70]Power-ups can restore health and psi energy.
[185:31.04]Okay.
[185:31.82]Search the compound for more power-ups.
[185:37.34]So, Select is... I can use that.
[185:39.56]No reason for me to use it right now.
[185:43.10]Pistol ammo.
[185:46.32]I can just... Okay, you can just boot shit.
[185:50.10]Anything in these?
[185:59.91]Nothing?
[186:00.45]No?
[186:04.17]Oh, it hurts so bad.
[186:15.03]Is this when I get my psychic brain powers?
[186:19.47]Okay.
[186:29.30]So, stealth?
[186:57.19]I have to be quiet in real life, too.
[186:59.78]Enemies can see.
[187:00.32]Why did that say press to lock onto an enemy or object?
[187:02.52]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[187:06.28]So I can hold the button down to strafe.
[187:07.94]So the triangle is to lock on somebody.
[187:09.65]Did I... I locked on and it... No, what?
[187:16.37]I'm trying just to fucking figure out how to control the game.
[187:34.18]How are you still living after that?
[187:42.80]I have one bullet left.
[187:51.76]How do I switch guns?
[187:54.64]Didn't I get pistol ammo?
[188:00.21]Yeah.
[188:06.48]Okay.
[188:08.44]So I can strafe if I hold triangle.
[188:12.16]It's time to kick something, maybe.
[188:23.03]There's nobody else even down here, so... We've been playing Shootman games?
[188:32.88]Uh, well this is... This game is not a Shootman game.
[188:38.28]This is the first little area, and then you turn into a psychic... The Force Unleashed... Maniac.
[188:56.74]It's too bad that Stuntman 2 was so fun, but it was too crusty and I can get the better version of it.
[189:02.27]Anything else I can do?
[189:03.23]Any more stuff to look at?
[189:06.33]I don't think so.
[189:06.85]Alright, give me the silence gun.
[189:25.69]Stepping over metal or puddles will alert your enemies.
[189:28.75]Short rapid shots or burst fire is... Can I at least read the tutorial?
[189:50.05]I gotta heal.
[189:53.06]Uh, this is a 25% health, 50% health.
[189:55.68]Alright, watch the grates.
[190:24.05]Don't worry, I promise I'll do that to somebody.
[190:30.57]Need a keycard.
[190:37.31]Anybody coming?
[190:37.87]Don't step on the grate!
[190:44.41]Critical body parts can be... ...can be like this.
[190:56.64]Keycard!
[190:59.70]Let's move!
[191:00.34]That guy sucked.
[191:12.29]Okay, where is she?
[191:16.79]Laughing my ass off.
[191:26.55]What took you so long?
[191:27.73]Where'd they take my squad?
[191:30.23]That didn't take very long at all.
[191:32.43]But you're not ready, Nick.
[191:33.47]You have to recover your abilities.
[191:35.03]I'm ready to go now.
[191:36.37]You need to find some people.
[191:38.49]This dude fucking sucks.
[191:39.97]Laughing my ass off.
[191:42.21]Oh, don't do that to me again.
[191:45.61]Don't you?
[191:49.84]What was that?
[191:50.34]It's for your own good, Nathan.
[191:51.82]The hell it is.
[191:52.97]Who are you?
[191:53.23]It was just air.
[191:53.75]It was just air.
[191:54.45]Calm down.
[191:55.39]I'm working inside the movement as a double agent.
[191:58.49]I can keep helping you as long as I don't get caught.
[192:00.73]What did you give me?
[192:01.95]First things first.
[192:03.37]You don't have security clearance, but if you trip the switch, all security beams will go down.
[192:08.69]Then you can make your way to the elevator to get to the second floor.
[192:13.35]Here's the key to the generator room.
[192:14.77]Here's my American Express.
[192:15.53]Get going before they discover you've escaped.
[192:18.87]Be careful where you use it though because nobody takes it anymore Let me get -2 for that come on He he what's in your wallet Not like this
[192:48.08]My gate training facility 12 years ago.
[192:50.18]Telekinesis training.
[192:51.52]Here we go.
[192:53.60]Alright, Nick.
[192:54.72]Let's start your telekinesis training.
[192:57.02]To keep it simple, I'm going to start referring to telekinesis as TK from now on.
[193:01.98]TK.
[193:02.60]Also, we've juiced you up with unlimited psi powers during this test.
[193:07.01]Hey, thanks.
[193:07.89]In the real world, all psi powers drain with use.
[193:13.72]We'll skip the spoon-bending and start by controlling objects using telekinesis.
[193:19.22]First, select a target to TK by moving the aim reticle over the object.
[193:24.16]Always refer to the HUD for control instructions.
[193:26.84]Stand at the edge of the map and do TK Pulse to the three friends you're playing with.
[193:32.63]It's guaranteed that you'll fucking annoy the hell out of them and they won't want to play with you anymore.
[193:39.77]Okay, target object with aim.
[193:42.05]Okay.
[193:42.97]Press and hold L1.
[193:45.35]Select and lift object.
[193:46.29]So L1 is select and lift object and right analog stick.
[193:49.45]Pressure sensitive.
[193:51.51]I got... That's not going to work with my shitty Mad Catz controller.
[193:54.23]Do I even have that?
[194:10.23]My pressure-sensitive button is not... that's not gonna work!
[194:12.41]So you admit!
[194:17.94]Press and hold L1 to select and lift object.
[194:19.56]Move object with the right analog stick.
[194:23.24]And release it.
[194:24.02]Uhh...
[194:40.05]Yeah, so I'm just gonna jump over them.
[194:41.89]Okay, that's easy enough.
[194:54.74]Why do I have 2... 2 minutes and 43 seconds to... I just tried to jump.
[194:58.60]Come on.
[195:01.56]Why are you turning to the left?
[195:04.58]Climb it!
[195:10.32]Nice climbing, Nick.
[195:12.04]I want you to use telekinesis to move a crate through each hole in the wall.
[195:16.15]This is just destroy all humans, but with less, hey, laughing my ass off.
[195:20.47]Don't throw the crate.
[195:21.55]It'll break easily.
[195:22.89]First, get a crate through the hole on the lower left.
[195:32.63]Move crate through the hole.
[195:33.87]Press until it's at the desired height.
[195:37.08]Move the object with the right analog stick.
[195:40.24]Mm-hmm.
[195:43.38]God damn it.
[195:45.80]God damn it.
[195:56.71]Guys, I don't think I can play this with this dumb bootleg controller.
[196:14.32]Okay, let's try it again.
[196:18.50]What?
[196:25.49]I want you to use telekinesis to move a... Oh, the left hole.
[196:33.77]Okay.
[196:35.31]Fuck.
[196:36.79]I'm pressing it as lightly as possible.
[196:40.35]I think I... Oh man, this is going to be hard to do.
[196:52.84]Alright, I can get it.
[196:53.76]Now move a crate through the hole in the center.
[197:06.76]I can get the ones that are tall.
[197:08.40]Now pick up a crate for the last hole.
[197:13.59]The multi-lift!
[197:20.84]Okay, release... Lift an object to its maximum height, release L1, then quickly press and hold L1 again to lift an object higher.
[197:31.58]Okay.
[197:34.68]So you go like this, and then you... it's all the way at the top.
[197:40.80]Okay.
[197:42.32]Just come back this way.
[197:47.32]Got it!
[197:47.62]Can't wait, this is gonna be great.
[197:49.14]This guy's just Stuntman.
[198:11.72]Move the right analog stick in the direction of test subject, and then release L1 to throw object.
[198:17.03]Okay, well, I got it!
[198:25.37]That guy was moving!
[198:39.09]This guy's just trying to run away now.
[198:41.21]Finally, try to hit a target moving on an irregular path.
[198:45.89]Oh, please God, don't hit me.
[198:53.89]Now that you've practiced throwing objects, you can also TK most enemies.
[198:58.52]TK enemy and throw him against the wall.
[199:01.78]His weapon will drop after he dies.
[199:20.46]That was cool.
[199:21.02]Oh, goddammit.
[199:22.00]Killing people in training.
[199:22.86]It is good fun, you're right.
[199:31.31]Oops.
[199:31.47]Got him.
[199:32.21]Now shake the gun at this guy.
[199:51.75]That didn't count?
[199:58.92]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[200:02.46]Alright.
[200:03.22]Throw him against the wall.
[200:04.96]Damn.
[200:05.42]Keep throwing him into walls?
[200:06.50]This is not even a training exercise.
[200:08.46]That guy just shot actual bullets at me.
[200:20.75]Now TK the next target.
[200:22.55]And while he's in the air, use your weapon to shoot him.
[200:25.19]That's what I did to the first guy.
[200:32.78]You got it, scribe.
[200:36.82]Nice.
[200:37.14]Okay, fun.
[200:39.20]There's another gun right in front of you, Nick.
[200:41.30]Target it and TK throw it to yourself to collect the ammo.
[200:45.18]Ooh, that's cool.
[200:48.80]TK firearm.
[201:14.50]Kill five enemies using TK within the time limit.
[201:16.62]Use assault rifle if needed.
[201:17.90]And you can shield yourself behind objects.
[201:20.44]Alright.
[201:24.12]Oops.
[201:24.94]Oh shit.
[201:43.79]You can throw them into the barrels.
[201:45.73]Dead?
[201:46.33]Who's left?
[201:49.11]Oh fuck, I died.
[201:52.79]I got too...
[202:15.85]Got kicked right in the chest.
[202:19.77]I was having too much fun.
[202:24.15]I killed five enemies.
[202:26.69]I didn't kill five people?
[202:29.13]How is that possible?
[202:42.00]Got him.
[202:47.36]Into his friend.
[202:50.80]There's another guy.
[203:24.04]Sometimes I feel like it doesn't work when I let go.
[203:25.32]Right into the box.
[203:25.86]That dude's gonna be a boss?
[203:29.79]Probably.
[203:53.99]When you get killed, you may choose to continue from the most recent checkpoint that was reached.
[203:58.11]If you wish to save your progress, select the save checkpoint option from the pause menu.
[204:02.68]Okay.
[204:04.90]You create a new save that resumes play at the save checkpoint.
[204:08.84]So, I'm just going to pause and hit save game.
[204:10.72]Don't let me forget that.
[204:11.48]So now I've got my PK powers.
[204:17.32]Let's put them to good use.
[204:23.48]So I have a keycard now.
[204:24.38]That was gonna... Where was that gonna take me?
[204:26.28]Do I have a map or anything?
[204:27.26]Yeah.
[204:29.88]So I need to go... Where am I?
[204:35.48]Approximate location.
[204:36.36]So I need to go... Down to the generator room.
[204:44.53]Or actually straight ahead maybe?
[204:48.43]Yeah, I already lost... I just... I spent a... I just did like an entire tutorial.
[204:53.72]I don't remember what the hell the last thing I was supposed to do was.
[204:59.70]Checkpoint is straight ahead, so the objective is the green things.
[205:08.71]Okay.
[205:08.95]Oh, there's even more.
[205:14.31]I can only afford one color, you picked green.
[205:17.11]There's like, every room.
[205:21.83]Uh, alright.
[205:26.53]I actually don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to do.
[205:28.89]That cutscene felt like ages ago.
[205:33.36]Ow!
[205:36.68]I just jumped into the laser grid.
[205:38.76]Whoops!
[205:49.46]So I gotta turn that off.
[205:50.94]I'll just look at the map again.
[206:00.18]Do I have to turn that shit off?
[206:03.08]I mean, this was on the objective.
[206:05.27]Is there anything else I need to do in here?
[206:11.05]No, no, no.
[206:11.47]It's the room before this.
[206:15.87]I can't believe I just have to heal now.
[206:22.28]TK the laser?
[206:23.28]I don't think that'll do anything.
[206:28.65]Wait, there was a room here, wasn't there?
[206:34.41]What was this?
[206:35.39]This is that room with the guy's head.
[206:36.59]Okay, so we have to go this way.
[206:43.18]So then from here I can go down.
[207:06.66]Fucking mad cats.
[207:08.25]It's not even a mad cats controller anyways.
[207:10.05]It's not a mad cats controller.
[207:11.09]I don't even know what it is.
[207:26.56]Fucking, of course.
[207:27.94]I can't... I can't do a light touch.
[207:46.14]because bad controller.
[207:47.68]Well, let me at least heal.
[207:59.12]Alright, this might- this is the look- this is the look you can throw that at somebody.
[208:14.86]Who can I throw this at?
[208:19.13]Got him.
[208:26.04]Oh my god.
[208:42.95]Mad because cats.
[208:47.68]Now lift him up.
[208:48.34]I want to throw him up in the air.
[208:50.64]Is he still falling?
[208:59.21]No, he's right here.
[209:00.65]I'm so confused.
[209:02.31]Where the fuck did you guys come from?
[209:13.51]Okay.
[209:14.59]That waterfall is so loud, I can't even hear anything.
[209:22.40]What?
[209:24.34]Oh, I went down there too.
[209:25.32]It was very unnecessary, but I had to do it.
[209:42.95]Shut them off.
[209:44.95]They're too loud.
[209:50.15]Good job, Nick.
[209:51.05]What the hell is this?
[209:53.63]Where are you?
[209:54.59]I'm speaking to you inside your mind through telepathy.
[209:58.12]Telepathy?
[209:59.42]Those movement agents that work for the general have some sort of... He said it's so spooky.
[210:04.00]Nick, hurry.
[210:05.26]Get a keycard in the guard room to use the elevator.
[210:09.96]Keycard from the guard room.
[210:11.18]New objective.
[210:13.90]So I can go through the... I'll just open the laser door.
[210:21.49]Let's go this way.
[210:33.40]She's using her chakra.
[210:37.16]Well, didn't know you were gonna be here.
[210:38.94]Wait, barrel!
[210:49.76]I'll be right back
[212:53.28]Okay.
[212:54.74]I'm back.
[212:55.08]Let's do it.
[212:59.28]How do I turn the camera?
[213:11.30]No, just... Come here.
[213:35.03]Whoa!
[213:35.25]Watch out!
[213:35.71]Fucking goddammit!
[213:36.44]How am I able?
[213:36.94]Here we go.
[213:37.40]This brings us back here.
[213:46.32]We need to go...
[214:05.41]Look at that.
[214:07.67]So I need to go to the guard room.
[214:08.77]Where's the guard room?
[214:11.39]Generator room.
[214:12.51]Guard room is right through here.
[214:16.74]At least it should be.
[214:18.74]Guard room?
[214:21.52]Upstairs?
[214:21.90]Where's the guard room?
[214:34.07]No, I'm not in the right place.
[214:39.58]Destroy all humans.
[214:42.72]This is not correct.
[214:43.38]This is back in the... Supply room?
[214:50.64]How do I get... I gotta go to the elevator.
[214:52.29]How do I get to the... this section here?
[215:00.29]Security lower silo.
[215:03.85]I think I was supposed to stay down there.
[215:07.63]Shit.
[215:08.95]Was I supposed to stay down there?
[215:10.11]Where the hell am I now?
[215:26.68]Shotgun?
[215:27.16]Did I just find a secret item?
[215:31.15]I think I did.
[215:37.30]That's pretty cool.
[215:46.69]Best weapon in the game, really?
[215:48.77]That's pretty cool.
[215:49.35]Alright, so if I go up this way, just out of curiosity... I wonder if I... What's through here?
[216:09.05]That's like the beginning of the game.
[216:10.01]Did this take me anywhere?
[216:16.07]I thought that was a person.
[216:20.00]He threw a gun away with full ammo.
[216:21.54]Yeah, but I got the new secret loot one.
[216:28.22]What's that?
[216:29.34]I don't think I came back there.
[216:33.11]What was your favorite weapon in Halo 3?
[216:35.80]Um... I don't know.
[216:38.04]This is just back at the beginning.
[216:43.22]The default assault rifle that you get at the beginning of the game.
[216:46.10]That's the only weapon I think I've ever seen in that game.
[216:52.26]Alright.
[216:53.06]This is the cell.
[216:59.31]Okay...
[217:03.70]Should I just keep... I don't know where the fuck I'm supposed to go.
[217:06.77]Is this the guard room?
[217:23.08]No.
[217:24.42]Huh.
[217:34.01]There's so many Halo boomers in the chat.
[217:37.51]Halo's a celebrated franchise.
[217:46.87]Yeah, where's the guard room?
[217:51.31]Can I go down?
[217:51.91]Is this an elevator or something?
[217:55.23]It's a total college game, bro.
[217:56.85]It was!
[218:04.91]This way.
[218:05.33]Go down from here.
[218:06.43]And now... I... I have no idea.
[218:19.78]I haven't been there.
[218:20.60]I've been... Okay, found it.
[218:21.30]Found it.
[218:21.56]Got it.
[218:21.90]Got it.
[218:22.06]Got it.
[218:22.20]Got it.
[218:22.36]Got it.
[218:22.54]Good.
[218:22.76]Good.
[218:22.98]Good.
[218:24.16]Okay, I wanted to shoot that guy big.
[218:39.06]Okay.
[218:41.10]I really am going to run out of ammo, aren't I?
[218:42.38]It's that supply room again.
[218:44.40]Okay, down.
[218:50.33]No.
[218:50.83]No.
[218:51.07]No.
[218:51.59]No.
[218:53.19]No, this is incorrect.
[218:58.35]What?
[219:04.80]Remote viewing enabled.
[219:15.66]manga anime Netflix adaptation in the the big brain exploding now it's time to learn remote viewing or rv for short remote viewing is an out-of-body stealth skill that allows hell is this through doors and around obstructions when using rv you won't be able to attack
[219:37.15]Press the remote viewing button, then move around like you normally would.
[219:40.67]Press it again to exit RV.
[219:42.43]Remember, Nick, you can go right through doors.
[219:45.75]So I can walk through walls?
[219:47.27]Now, use RV to help find the computer terminal that unlocks the door.
[219:51.35]So, left to activate RV, use the left analog stick to move, find computer terminal.
[219:57.36]Psy energy drains faster while moving in an RV.
[220:06.17]I thought I could go through walls.
[220:29.52]Oh, I hate this.
[220:36.43]Can I never use this?
[220:37.27]I'm not gonna use this ability in the whole game.
[220:45.38]This is what it feels like.
[220:46.24]You guys wanna know what it feels like to be blackout drunk?
[220:49.60]It's like that.
[220:58.54]This is what it's like.
[220:59.76]You don't want to be like this.
[221:03.72]My eyes kind of hurt, actually, after that.
[221:05.81]Next test.
[221:28.13]Why would you put a red barrel there?
[221:31.22]PK mine migraine.
[221:40.60]Find cover on high, press left to activate RV.
[221:42.80]Use RV to observe enemy behavior.
[221:45.69]So let's get to cover.
[221:46.67]I don't have to, okay, I can activate it like here.
[221:55.20]Alright, RV.
[221:57.92]Observe enemy behavior.
[221:58.66]Press X to continue.
[222:04.43]He's putting salt all over the... Is he gonna see me?
[222:11.59]I was spotted.
[222:12.27]Who?
[222:16.01]Oh.
[222:16.63]That guy.
[222:18.01]I tried to get away from... I thought I could go up really close.
[222:26.74]I didn't want to have to do this part.
[222:33.80]There you go.
[222:35.59]He walks around the corner and then surrenders.
[222:37.79]And I got caught.
[222:39.03]No, you did.
[222:40.23]He got caught.
[222:42.53]Alright.
[223:04.51]Cool shit.
[223:05.67]Can I pull out now?
[223:14.77]Sneak attack.
[223:15.34]So now I know what his route is.
[223:16.42]Comes around here and he looks this way.
[223:18.04]Let's see.
[223:18.38]Wait for him.
[223:37.47]Gotta wait for his route.
[223:45.94]Hello?
[223:48.76]Turn around.
[223:59.85]Got ya.
[224:08.39]What's next?
[224:10.17]What?
[224:10.43]How am I supposed to sneak past?
[224:42.57]Thank you!
[224:43.35]Alright, let's observe what they're doing.
[224:44.76]That's enough of that.
[225:20.36]Okay.
[225:21.24]What are you up to?
[225:21.78]Where is he?
[225:35.37]Where is he?
[225:37.19]Okay.
[225:41.39]Oh, god damn it.
[225:47.62]That's so bright.
[225:48.78]If it wasn't so bright, it would kill- it's killing me.
[225:51.08]Whatever, just go.
[225:52.64]I know this guy's right here.
[225:56.64]And this guy's right here.
[226:04.39]SHIT!
[226:05.25]Okay, I can do them both.
[226:08.09]I can do them both real quick.
[226:09.03]I just don't want to do the mind brightness thing.
[226:16.03]Right here, ready, watch.
[226:29.20]No.
[226:29.28]Where's the door?
[226:29.94]Where's the next door?
[226:30.40]What the hell's going on?
[227:14.84]Get a rat in a maze.
[227:15.86]Just a bunch of fucking mice.
[227:17.36]Use RV to navigate the maze.
[227:19.10]Reach the terminal and press X to unlock the door.
[227:55.29]What?
[227:56.04]That's unbelievable.
[228:01.68]I can't believe it.
[228:06.34]That was so embarrassing.
[228:08.18]Not for me.
[228:11.03]Alright, it don't matter.
[228:11.89]I just have to get over there.
[228:12.97]I don't care.
[228:13.43]Give me this better gun.
[228:23.91]I'm not going to blind myself.
[228:55.23]Where is it?
[229:05.46]Good.
[229:05.96]Get out.
[229:08.60]You did an excellent job, Nick.
[229:10.54]Now let's go get some lunch.
[229:12.06]I'm starving.
[229:13.58]Me too.
[229:14.82]What are we eating?
[229:22.28]I wasn't going to... I don't want to do that.
[229:33.09]Uh...
[229:36.08]Oh, look!
[229:36.40]There's a guy there.
[229:40.70]Thanks for the tip!
[229:42.28]Alright, he's dead.
[230:07.87]Wait.
[230:08.63]This guy's coming over here.
[230:15.50]Uh-oh.
[230:19.34]Get his ammo.
[230:20.71]Good call.
[230:28.11]It's like being out of bounds in New Vegas.
[230:42.27]That was... I should have just shot them.
[230:45.75]What?
[230:47.17]Okay.
[230:52.17]Guy coming down from the ceiling.
[231:01.33]Guy right there.
[231:13.56]Who's left?
[231:15.88]Not that bad, pretty good.
[231:27.84]Quick tip, you're out of psi power.
[231:29.78]You can increase your psi power by using psi power ups in your inventory.
[231:44.82]He's doing a Y pose.
[231:46.23]That's not... You can't shout that out.
[231:48.53]I don't want to see any more Y pose shoutouts.
[232:14.38]Has this guy not noticed this yet?
[232:15.58]What does he have in his hand?
[232:20.05]Thanks for the keycard.
[232:24.59]Hypo spray.
[232:25.47]Some lab coats carry hypo sprays.
[232:27.39]Pick them up to instantly restore health and psi energy.
[232:30.49]They can't be carried in your inventory.
[232:31.74]Okay.
[232:33.96]How do I get that?
[232:35.62]That's how.
[232:39.28]No.
[232:39.56]Kick, kick, kick.
[232:42.04]Kick these.
[232:54.31]Okay, new electrical grid gone.
[233:00.28]Okay, now that... I need to take myself... Can I shoot through here?
[233:08.62]I can do side power through there.
[233:10.36]Let me... Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[233:11.15]Let me look through this.
[233:15.17]Never mind.
[233:16.45]I can't.
[233:24.77]There's another... Never mind.
[233:38.50]Where am I shooting this guy from to be moving like that?
[233:42.38]Okay, this one open now.
[233:46.48]OH MY FUCKING Jesus, THERE'S A MINIGUN IN HERE!
[233:53.41]What?
[233:56.33]Can I rip it off or something?
[233:59.95]I don't...
[234:32.00]I think I have to put that down and then sprint across.
[234:36.46]Wait a minute, let's take a look at that area.
[234:40.34]Okay, there's a minigun.
[234:43.66]Is there a way to get out of here?
[234:44.68]I don't think there's anything even in here.
[234:48.95]Can I open that door?
[234:58.45]No, lift it up.
[235:02.70]I mean, I can hold it, but remember, Mad Catz dogshit controller.
[235:06.82]Alright, we'll get so far.
[235:21.02]Whoa!
[235:32.47]Can I get a med kit?
[235:45.02]It's... still...
[236:03.80]Alright, we're good.
[236:16.37]This looks like a long way.
[236:18.77]Did I get a Force Jump?
[236:31.01]Completion time, 23 hours and 37 minutes.
[236:35.21]Items broken with TK, 37.
[236:37.53]Preferred weapon, machine gun.
[236:38.73]Shots fired, 300.
[236:39.81]Accuracy, 77% is not bad.
[236:42.29]Even though it's an auto-target.
[236:46.12]Movement property damage, 69,120 bucks.
[236:48.78]Holy shit, he made it inside the clock tower.
[236:54.58]Are you kidding me?
[237:00.11]How come there's no resident PogChamp?
[237:03.07]You know, like a sleeping face with like a, wow, I'm excited.
[237:13.49]Does that exist?
[237:19.06]Nick, you're starting to remember who you really are.
[237:22.57]It's an awful idea.
[237:23.86]It is.
[237:24.26]What?
[237:54.34]Press select?
[237:55.30]New object?
[237:56.42]Why did that cut off?
[238:00.34]Explore the movement's compound and locate the rest of your squad.
[238:08.24]Oh god, will you please...
[238:33.61]Let's go.
[238:34.07]Okay, Nick.
[238:34.95]Let's learn about Mind Drain, also referred to as MD.
[238:38.49]Mind Drain.
[238:39.09]Mind Drain absorbs psionic energy from another person's brain.
[238:42.49]Next game, Resident Champ.
[238:46.39]We'll start off with the basics.
[238:48.29]Eliminate this guard however you'd like.
[238:50.51]Then I'll tell you how to drain him.
[238:56.15]Okay, kill the guard.
[238:56.93]I'm not gonna lie, I wasn't even looking at the screen.
[239:02.84]I was looking at what other game I had here.
[239:08.87]I can't pick him up?
[239:15.75]I couldn't pick him up.
[239:16.45]Get close to the body.
[239:17.79]Then press and hold the mind drain button.
[239:19.83]So R2 is mind drain.
[239:21.33]Hold the button down.
[239:22.87]The drain will end automatically.
[239:24.67]Draining a dead body only replenishes part of your energy.
[239:28.02]To replenish all of your energy, you need to drain a live target.
[239:31.94]We'll try that in the next room.
[239:33.24]So electrocute somebody's brain until you suck out other energy.
[239:35.30]Got it.
[239:35.44]So let's drain a live target now.
[239:37.18]You can only drain a person who is unaware of your presence.
[239:40.64]Sneak up on the enemy from behind until you get close.
[239:43.80]Then perform the mind drain.
[239:48.12]Sneak up, press and hold R2 to execute Mind Drain until he dies.
[240:03.24]You gotta be real close.
[240:04.14]That was pretty brutal.
[240:07.18]Who are these people that we're doing this to?
[240:10.54]So, blow up their brains.
[240:12.60]Alright, I'll give it a try.
[240:44.39]What a horrible way to go.
[240:47.44]Just microwaving that guy's brain.
[240:56.68]Nice.
[240:57.10]Yeah, nice.
[241:00.15]Nice work.
[241:14.06]Excellent.
[241:14.78]Next, you'll replenish your power or die.
[241:19.62]Pretty matter-of-fact there, boss.
[241:20.92]For this last test, I'm going to deplete all of your psi energy to stuff.
[241:25.36]Then, use Mind Drain to replenish all of your energy within the time limit.
[241:30.21]Anything goes, Nick.
[241:31.53]Do whatever it takes to get all of your psi energy back.
[241:36.69]Okay, refill to maximum.
[241:39.41]Do not die.
[241:42.88]Alright, let me see if I can scout this out here.
[241:44.46]Where is anybody?
[241:45.62]Left side?
[241:53.03]Just this one guy, right?
[242:01.69]Another guy at a computer over here?
[242:04.09]Maybe?
[242:05.73]Well, he's right there.
[242:09.67]Is there a distraction button or something?
[242:11.95]Hello, uh, where did you come from?
[242:13.47]I don't know if I can get it to max now.
[242:31.58]No, there's one more guy.
[242:32.48]Out of bullets.
[242:35.90]Not good.
[242:37.28]I can't use any of my mind powers.
[242:43.52]Does he have hair now?
[242:51.36]I don't remember him having hair.
[242:53.64]Did he have hair?
[243:16.89]No?
[243:18.13]Okay.
[243:18.89]He was bald, wasn't he?
[243:19.77]Alright.
[243:29.76]Door's locked.
[243:30.40]What am I supposed to do about this?
[243:33.60]They're gonna make a walkway.
[243:34.82]Guaranteed.
[243:49.50]What?
[243:50.28]Oh, God.
[243:54.57]I gotta drop these guys in the electricity, right?
[244:01.29]I missed it!
[244:08.00]So, obviously it turned this power off somehow.
[244:16.38]No.
[244:18.36]Um... Up?
[244:22.76]Up here?
[244:23.06]No button?
[244:34.57]Access denied.
[244:35.27]Why the hell not?
[244:44.49]There's a ladder here.
[244:53.33]I'm gonna get fried if I do that.
[244:57.89]Oh.
[245:02.52]Don't press the warning button?
[245:07.22]That's not an alarm, is it?
[245:09.22]No.
[245:10.62]Can't...
[245:23.18]That's all I wanted to do.
[245:27.72]Oh my god, MonkaS!
[245:36.74]Anything else?
[245:37.14]A teleportation pad?
[245:40.72]Nope.
[245:42.58]Not like a Star Trek thing, is it?
[245:54.23]Everybody just get electrified.
[246:01.31]One, two, three!
[246:06.44]Let's go!
[246:10.68]Hey!
[246:12.42]Uh-oh, gas has fell in the room.
[246:17.50]What do I do about this?
[246:25.09]Open the door!
[246:27.13]Open the door!
[246:27.79]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, wait!
[246:50.11]No, he's not in the gas room!
[246:52.81]There was just a guy in here.
[246:54.97]Oh, fuck.
[246:56.37]What are you doing?
[246:57.25]He's got a keycard.
[246:59.67]Break it!
[247:04.50]What the fuck?
[247:11.68]Oh, for the love of God.
[247:12.76]There's a health pack in here.
[247:18.26]Wait.
[247:29.11]You're not heavy enough.
[247:30.11]Got a keycard, right?
[247:36.40]Bingo.
[247:37.02]What are you doing?
[247:44.79]Any more health?
[247:48.03]No.
[247:48.19]I only have this one little sliver of health.
[247:51.17]I gotta start sneaking.
[247:53.87]I'm gonna be in big trouble.
[248:05.74]Not refilling?
[248:06.34]Oh, that was a crazy room.
[248:11.62]Too many people there.
[248:15.92]I am Sanders.
[248:36.44]Apparently, that's apparently, all I got apparently is I am Sanders.
[248:44.61]That is truly awful.
[248:55.44]Wait, why?
[248:55.94]Why did that happen?
[249:00.81]Sarah, I found Sanders and he attacked me like some kind of zombie.
[249:06.37]They're meat puppets reprogrammed with an implant to fight for the movement.
[249:11.56]He came after me and his head exploded.
[249:14.88]I didn't do anything.
[249:15.88]Get to the main frame room.
[249:17.66]I need blueprints on this place and we need more information on the General's plans.
[249:35.58]I didn't mean to really do that but okay what's this one do so
[250:06.27]I thought you were kidding when you said that was what was gonna happen.
[250:09.07]I thought you were joking!
[250:17.10]It didn't happen the first time, so why did it happen this time?
[250:23.88]Dead?
[250:24.60]Not dead.
[250:29.56]Still alive.
[250:31.06]No.
[250:32.10]Alright, we're gonna suck some brains out.
[250:42.47]I think the exact wording was, what does this one do?
[250:51.35]I knew what it was supposed to do, but I didn't know what this one was supposed to do.
[250:57.11]I'm going to take the machine gun.
[251:01.09]Oh, it's dead.
[251:15.26]Uh, why wouldn't I just use the door?
[251:23.89]Who's that for?
[251:41.90]What's that?
[251:42.96]Help!
[251:53.39]Oh shit, when was the last time I saved?
[252:06.07]Okay, we're good.
[252:12.11]Next?
[252:12.53]No, not yet, not yet.
[252:24.37]Plus, I think I only have one more for tonight.
[252:27.63]Where is it?
[252:28.31]What is it?
[252:29.17]Let me see.
[252:34.63]I've got... Where did this one even come from?
[252:38.18]I don't remember even buying this.
[252:55.37]Can you cheat and get all the powers?
[252:56.73]Can you do that?
[252:58.63]Seems like cheating like you just said.
[253:00.35]I don't want to cheat.
[253:03.34]No, I'm not next in yet.
[253:04.44]I just want to see what else I have here.
[253:11.54]Curious of what else is over here.
[253:14.68]Got Urban Chaos.
[253:19.19]I've got the Jackass game.
[253:22.89]Jackass the video game.
[253:25.34]I don't know what that entails.
[253:35.13]There's also, um, I have the 50 cent game.
[253:46.14]Please don't play jackass.
[253:50.44]I'm not nexting this yet.
[253:51.56]No, no, no, not yet, not yet.
[253:53.08]I'm still going.
[253:55.89]The 50 Cent game should be its own stream.
[253:57.41]That's what I was thinking too.
[254:00.97]But I can't play the 50 Cent music.
[254:03.19]Yeah, that's gonna be awkward.
[254:11.18]Hello.
[254:15.26]Come here.
[254:19.21]No, I wanna... I'm trying to do something.
[254:29.00]I can't do it.
[254:36.36]No, I went the wrong way.
[254:37.04]I have to delete the VOD.
[254:46.65]If I play the 50 Cent game, I have to delete the VOD.
[254:52.11]No, I just turn all the music off, turn all the voice clips off, and just walk around.
[255:01.59]Just shatter that guy's spine.
[255:05.09]No, go press that button again.
[255:07.66]Press the button.
[255:09.18]Press that button that you just pressed.
[255:22.92]God damn it.
[255:35.23]I don't have enough power?
[255:38.07]How so?
[255:38.87]Come here.
[255:45.64]You fucking idiot.
[255:51.10]Just cut the shit already.
[255:57.57]We'll just restart the stream so we get a separate VOD.
[256:10.15]I have to go turn the alarm off.
[256:13.99]New VOD to get deleted.
[256:30.81]No, stop pressing this button!
[256:34.83]Turn it off!
[257:07.92]Every alarm is on right now All of them
[257:13.12]All turned on.
[257:22.91]Why am I trying to jump in the fire?
[257:24.23]No, I'm gonna use that.
[257:29.71]Let's drain.
[257:36.60]Psycho lap.
[257:38.70]Alright, I'm good.
[257:44.01]Can I drain the guys that are in there or no?
[257:47.55]What the hell is this?
[257:49.07]Implant device acquired.
[258:04.04]Why didn't they come in the door?
[258:16.25]Is it just waiting for me?
[258:19.76]Oh, god.
[258:23.60]Fuck.
[258:35.54]This is, ugh, OK.
[258:36.88]Come on.
[258:37.60]I can do this shit.
[258:38.40]I need to sneak better.
[258:47.78]Alright, that's it.
[258:49.22]That's it.
[258:49.82]I've had enough of you.
[258:51.12]You.
[258:51.50]You're the guy.
[258:52.56]You right here.
[258:54.12]Turn it off.
[258:56.58]Turn this shit off.
[258:57.80]Get... What did you deserve?
[259:02.43]Okay.
[259:20.51]Where did you even come from?
[259:26.31]Okay.
[259:28.61]Relax.
[259:29.97]Stealth.
[259:37.08]Anybody in here?
[259:37.56]Any medkits in here?
[259:42.56]No, not even.
[259:46.76]Not even any medkits.
[259:50.71]Unbelievable.
[259:53.83]Okay.
[259:54.77]Here we go.
[259:56.11]Go do that.
[259:57.41]Implant device.
[260:01.12]Stealth.
[260:02.88]How many people... Wait.
[260:03.68]Let me just do this right.
[260:04.68]How many people are in the room?
[260:06.20]One.
[260:07.72]Two.
[260:09.04]Does that guy turn around?
[260:09.90]I don't think that guy turns around ever.
[260:21.20]He's turning.
[260:23.30]Okay, just wait for this guy to turn.
[260:24.60]We're gonna stealth kill.
[260:25.74]Come on.
[260:33.28]Turn.
[260:38.28]Oh my god!
[260:39.08]Help me!
[260:40.64]Help me!
[260:51.21]Okay.
[260:52.39]Done.
[260:55.13]Implant device.
[260:59.39]What am I supposed to do about this?
[261:00.90]I hate you!
[261:08.18]Why did it show that on the screen?
[261:11.20]Was there a reason?
[261:16.68]It zoomed in on this.
[261:18.78]It got close of that.
[261:20.78]That thing.
[261:30.42]Okay.
[261:33.62]But what was the reason for this?
[261:36.47]It zoomed in on that.
[261:39.75]Yes, it did.
[261:40.19]It zoomed in on that.
[261:41.03]It zoomed in on that and zoomed in on this.
[261:42.89]I'll die right now.
[261:43.79]I'll go get myself shot in the face right now to show you that again.
[261:52.81]Sure it did.
[261:53.25]It did.
[261:56.59]Don't make me die right now.
[261:57.77]Do it again.
[262:12.08]I don't believe you.
[262:12.84]You have to.
[262:14.30]You have to trust me on this.
[262:17.84]Allows access to the Cario storage facility.
[262:24.13]That guy doesn't have a head.
[262:24.87]I can't steal his soul.
[262:37.55]So where the heck is that?
[262:39.63]Down there?
[262:52.22]Streamer's lying to 4,000 people.
[262:54.46]What a lie.
[263:03.98]When did I lie?
[263:04.34]What are you talking about?
[263:10.00]What did I lie about?
[263:10.68]I didn't lie.
[263:22.25]Can I break this ice?
[263:23.09]It's just ice.
[263:32.96]That would have melted.
[263:44.02]Unrealistic.
[263:46.44]Stupid, unrealistic game.
[264:00.31]Sarah, I'm at the mainframe room.
[264:03.09]The door is locked.
[264:04.45]I should have known.
[264:05.49]This is a high security area.
[264:07.33]Probably the only one with a password is Jov Leonov.
[264:10.66]Leonov?
[264:11.50]He runs the Meat Puppet program.
[264:13.16]Meat Puppet?
[264:13.68]He's a former KGB Psy agent and master of mind control.
[264:17.80]The password is in his office.
[264:19.82]Find a way to get it, but be careful.
[264:22.16]His powers are dangerous.
[264:25.32]Can't you do it?
[264:29.37]Obtain the passcode for the door to the mainframe room.
[264:32.94]Some guy's office.
[264:48.13]I thought I did it for a second.
[264:49.35]I was about to shit my pants and go get a lottery ticket.
[265:09.18]another cutscene first boss first boss first boss
[265:32.81]Do I just walk in?
[265:33.75]Present myself?
[266:03.75]I heard everything.
[266:05.39]And then a bullet just goes right through the top of my skull.
[266:21.15]Hey, what's your password?
[266:33.57]1733, mainframe password.
[266:36.45]You just leave that out on your desk.
[266:42.98]Apparently you were waiting for me somehow.
[266:48.56]I grabbed onto the wall.
[266:55.89]What's in here?
[267:07.60]I just fucking panini pressed myself, I'm aware.
[267:09.66]I need better guns.
[267:16.15]No, this thing sucks.
[267:45.43]One.
[267:46.81]Seven.
[267:48.33]Three.
[267:48.81]Three.
[267:50.48]Four digits don't work anymore.
[267:51.78]I need to do six.
[267:53.06]Didn't you hear the news?
[268:00.42]Oh, this is bad.
[268:01.46]This is very bad, actually.
[268:08.45]Six digit password can be broken with a brute force in 12 hours now.
[268:13.43]Not good.
[268:13.85]It's got to be at least eight.
[268:20.01]I'm gonna die.
[268:44.03]Health pack?
[268:44.63]Gimme that.
[268:48.69]Somebody's saying, I'm actually yawning in real life.
[268:51.05]You are?
[268:52.93]Come on, this is the mind-git conspiracy!
[268:56.29]Wake up!
[269:09.52]20 years ago, if you had this game in your library of four PlayStation 2 games, because they were like 80 bucks each,
[269:19.34]You would have been so excited for this one.
[269:25.92]Resident champ.
[269:28.06]I'll give you a resident champ, okay?
[269:34.57]Did you find anything?
[269:36.05]Yeah.
[269:36.77]A map of the movement's compounds.
[269:38.51]And blueprints of this place.
[269:40.25]I would just cry to my mom to buy me another game.
[269:42.75]You would cry.
[269:43.29]Look around.
[269:43.69]I would cry until I got what I wanted.
[269:46.75]That's bad.
[269:47.45]That's really bad.
[269:48.79]Go through the vent system and meet Sarah in the Warhead storage room.
[270:13.35]It's a pretty nice brave little toaster computer you have here.
[270:16.29]Somebody's going to get that reference.
[270:17.25]I don't care if one person does.
[270:19.25]I'm glad you did.
[270:19.91]Alright.
[270:23.15]Go through the vent?
[270:26.97]Not pressing that.
[270:30.88]It's the ventilation system.
[270:34.94]How the heck am I supposed to get there?
[270:45.82]oh I need that because of the vent system
[271:12.39]What the hell is she talking about?
[271:14.37]Vent?
[271:15.05]There's no vents here?
[271:15.97]Where's this ventilation system in this room?
[271:32.07]How do I get up there?
[271:32.70]Oh, I have to use my brain.
[271:45.93]Blind?
[271:46.33]He's blind, he's blind, he's blind, he can't see, he can't even see!
[271:49.70]Is he just fine?
[271:52.28]When was the last time you guys had a piece of, like, a big bowl of candy?
[272:08.65]When was the last, like, Reese's you guys had?
[272:16.89]Turn up R9K or I'm gonna tell my mother on you.
[272:20.88]What's your mother gonna do?
[272:23.16]She's gonna say, no, that's a good thing, that you're not on the computer all day.
[272:28.64]She's gonna applaud the fact that you can't use the Twitch chat to write, I'm Jeff from Psychology 101, 30 times.
[272:36.76]And where the fuck did they come from?
[273:01.70]Mom, it's not fair.
[273:02.50]I was at the streamer's chat, and I tried to write 400 PogChamps in five minutes, and I couldn't do it.
[273:16.35]I'm so sorry about that, sweetie.
[273:20.40]And I... And I also want another video game, because PsyOps isn't even fun!
[273:25.30]Absolutely, sweetheart.
[273:26.44]Yeah!
[273:46.22]And I want a new TV, too!
[273:49.78]They do 4K now, don't you know, Ma?
[273:52.40]Yep.
[274:01.82]What is that?
[274:11.63]It's PogChamp.
[274:13.81]Ooh, fire extinguisher.
[274:14.85]What do I do with this?
[274:24.13]Oh, that would've been so cool.
[274:29.12]Oh, what?
[274:32.66]I think I didn't... I don't think I was... Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[274:35.90]What about me?
[274:38.48]I'm fine.
[274:42.62]I think I was supposed to.
[274:43.26]Uh, I don't know.
[274:48.16]I think I made it.
[274:48.64]Did I make it?
[274:56.45]Made it.
[274:57.74]Yeah, okay.
[274:58.30]I was supposed to do that.
[275:00.42]I need a health pack.
[275:17.50]What about you?
[275:18.42]What about me?
[275:21.82]Is there invisible walls here?
[275:25.61]Are there bumpers on this bowling alley, or can I fall down?
[275:29.47]Oh boy.
[275:29.99]There's a bridge.
[275:38.53]Not gonna fuck that up.
[275:42.83]Somebody said save.
[275:43.61]Mm-hmm.
[275:48.34]That would've been awful if I didn't.
[275:56.04]Mods are garbage.
[275:58.00]I don't think you guys know Nightbot is a thing.
[276:01.18]Just blame Nightbot for everything.
[276:03.45]Nightbot will time you out if you write, like, look at me a fucking thousand times.
[276:17.18]Level D, level A, level D. I don't know.
[276:23.10]What?
[276:29.66]Okay, I... Could I have squished my head?
[276:32.90]That guy better not be pressing an alarm.
[276:52.92]Wait, why?
[276:53.38]What?
[276:54.10]I can't... My eye of Krylog cannot go above a gap like that.
[277:14.36]Don't do it.
[277:15.18]Where?
[277:17.69]Who is doing this?
[277:22.19]Have a nice ride.
[277:23.25]I didn't even do it.
[277:27.74]I said like a dumb, shitty one-liner and I didn't even get it.
[277:31.52]Didn't have to.
[277:32.20]He walked off himself.
[277:33.96]Yeah, that's what happens when you play in the real bowling alley, dickhead.
[277:45.01]Just trying to catch him.
[278:00.56]Is that guy shitting?
[278:02.80]Why can I not drain him?
[278:13.71]I don't know why I couldn't drain him.
[278:16.40]I desperately need health.
[278:23.56]Like, right now.
[278:32.13]What's this?
[278:33.21]Ooh.
[278:35.07]No, I want that.
[278:41.32]It's literally to your left.
[278:44.42]Literally.
[278:57.07]Look at me!
[279:02.85]That sounded painful.
[279:10.58]Come on.
[279:11.10]Hey, literally, look at me.
[279:27.96]Okay, that was almost really bad.
[279:31.23]But I'm fine.
[279:44.03]Ooh, that was painful.
[279:45.54]Wait, wait, where is he?
[279:47.90]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, where?
[279:50.34]He's dead?
[280:17.57]Where the fuck do I go?
[280:18.54]We have triumph.
[280:33.40]How'd you triumph?
[280:34.78]What are you talking about?
[280:35.64]Did you guys just copy-paste it in?
[280:40.49]Don't you guys know that I don't like that?
[280:47.49]Are these alarms?
[280:51.47]Access denied.
[280:52.31]Do I have to go back down?
[281:05.59]I don't like those pastas.
[281:06.81]So don't do them.
[281:15.62]There's only, like, two good ones anyways.
[281:19.59]This is where I came in.
[281:30.19]Should I just go down?
[281:35.25]What are the good ones?
[281:37.12]Well... If I'd have to tell you.
[281:41.48]If I can't say it, because then everyone's gonna start doing it.
[281:50.42]That'll be a mystery forever.
[281:53.83]I think that almost killed me.
[281:54.95]I don't like the movement on that.
[282:04.47]Close.
[282:06.47]Real close.
[282:16.52]What is it?
[282:16.88]What is it?
[282:17.22]I'm not going to tell you.
[282:18.30]Why do you want to know so bad?
[282:32.32]Is it rude?
[282:33.07]Jerma at the grocery store.
[282:34.49]No.
[282:37.77]Door's locked.
[282:39.65]No access.
[282:41.93]What does this lady want me to do?
[282:43.41]Go through the vent system and meet Sarah in the warhead storage room.
[282:47.03]I'm in the warhead storage room, aren't I?
[282:50.36]Landing pad.
[282:51.16]Warhead storage.
[282:51.88]I'm like right here.
[283:05.50]Does it go through here?
[283:10.93]I could have known that was probably gonna happen.
[283:12.49]Where did it put me?
[283:29.85]This is really bad.
[283:38.06]I had to, like, jump off of that, too, and, like, break all of my bones and my body.
[283:45.47]No, I don't want to next that.
[283:47.53]Am I really... I'm so slightly annoyed by that.
[283:57.08]Through the vent, into the warhead room.
[284:02.04]Like, I should have known that was going to happen.
[284:03.82]I already made the reference to, like, Oh, I have no health.
[284:06.02]I almost died there.
[284:12.36]No, gotta get closer.
[284:21.74]So getting lost for six hours.
[284:23.58]I haven't lost.
[284:24.55]I haven't been lost.
[284:26.75]I'm going fine.
[284:29.41]This game's fun.
[284:32.19]It is.
[284:32.43]I have to do this whole thing all over again.
[284:48.15]Uh, that was horrible.
[284:53.65]I sucked that guy up.
[284:55.91]Now is it gonna go the other way?
[284:56.99]No, do it again.
[284:59.11]Do it.
[284:59.31]Suck him up.
[284:59.67]Suck this guy up.
[285:00.29]Suck him up!
[285:04.48]Suck him up!
[285:12.44]He's doing it on purpose now.
[285:22.27]No, I thought I could get a little bit further away than that.
[285:27.17]I don't think he's doing it on purpose.
[285:30.31]On purpose!
[285:31.86]He's doing it on purpose to get extra subs!
[285:36.38]Dude, I can't believe it, man.
[285:39.86]I got access to Jerma's Discord account.
[285:42.62]And if you see the DM he had with his mods talking about, hey, I'm going to do this on purpose.
[285:50.03]There's hundreds of thousands of cases where he had stuff calculated.
[286:15.52]Okay.
[286:16.72]That's off, right?
[286:17.86]I thought I turned it off.
[286:21.06]Now it's off.
[286:21.86]Okay.
[286:22.38]Good.
[286:23.06]Turn it back on.
[286:26.96]Okay.
[286:28.06]Wasn't a good place for you to stand.
[286:32.13]That guy got out of being an Amikrinder.
[286:34.29]Can you believe it?
[286:58.16]I don't believe it.
[287:00.38]You better.
[287:00.78]Oh my god.
[287:06.75]I don't even know where you guys even fucking come from.
[287:11.01]It doesn't make any sense.
[287:21.39]Is it still on fire?
[287:34.06]Alright, I'm good.
[287:38.04]Video games.
[287:47.31]Warhead storage, I'm here.
[287:49.47]I've made it.
[287:50.25]Where is she?
[287:56.33]Why are you not just here?
[287:57.51]Why are you not waiting for me?
[288:01.12]Don't fall.
[288:03.26]Everybody right now is just sitting there with their hands in their mouth.
[288:06.67]Oh, he's gonna fall off.
[288:09.85]You've bit through all your nails.
[288:12.61]You only have like your pinky nail left.
[288:33.04]What's going to happen?
[288:40.70]Did I bet you he's going to turn the corner?
[288:42.76]He's going to get blasted.
[288:43.96]Where the hell am I?
[288:56.50]Wait, this is the electricity room.
[289:03.91]I resort here.
[289:09.23]You mean to tell me that this was this close?
[289:16.63]Okay, this is the warhead room.
[289:19.38]Where am I supposed to meet her?
[289:22.82]Down?
[289:23.22]Maybe I just have to trigger a cutscene.
[289:24.68]Alright, we're going to try to trigger a cutscene here.
[289:30.29]Streamer hates his fans.
[289:31.17]Why?
[289:31.33]What are you talking about?
[289:32.39]I smoke three packs a day?
[289:33.55]I've never smoked a cigarette in my life.
[289:35.42]A full one.
[289:40.70]I have tried it, though.
[289:43.12]Yucky.
[289:43.79]Disgusting.
[289:44.43]Don't do it.
[289:59.56]Cutscene.
[290:00.56]Trigger the cutscene.
[290:07.79]Cutscene?
[290:12.63]He tried one, now he's gonna die early.
[290:14.21]No.
[290:19.17]That's not the case.
[290:25.60]Give cutscene, please.
[290:26.68]I know, right?
[290:29.06]This is bullshit.
[290:29.94]I'm gonna smoke a whole pack of cigarettes just for you.
[290:35.72]Why would you do that?
[290:42.32]Where's it gone?
[290:42.99]No, no, no, I don't wanna go up this... What did I press?
[290:45.55]Go north-left.
[290:45.97]What does north-left mean?
[290:58.96]Which way is north?
[291:00.42]I don't know which way north is.
[291:01.54]North left.
[291:16.21]Hey, watch this.
[291:18.05]Hey!
[291:18.57]Hey!
[291:19.13]Hey!
[291:19.67]Hey!
[291:20.23]Hey!
[291:41.57]I would be so mad if I heard that and I was a viewer.
[291:43.97]I'd be like, fuck this guy.
[291:46.27]You want to nuke the place?
[291:47.69]Not quite.
[291:49.25]These warheads don't have any nuclear material left, but they still have plenty of the conventional explosives.
[291:55.72]I've salvaged them for the materials we need for you to blow this base.
[291:59.52]Me?
[292:00.72]You train for this kind of op at Mindgate.
[292:03.72]Mindgate?
[292:05.32]The secret psi ops aren't... That's a joke.
[292:07.11]I need to be shamed.
[292:07.51]That's why I didn't make it.
[292:08.31]I pretend made it.
[292:08.97]They sign our paychecks.
[292:12.00]Wow.
[292:13.00]Don't you remember anything?
[292:16.54]The memory wipe allowed you to be captured.
[292:18.91]Your true memories were supposed to return once you were past the movement's mind probes.
[292:23.43]I'm sorry, Nick.
[292:24.39]Something's gone wrong, but we have to move on.
[292:27.49]According to the blueprints, this base has a major structural fault.
[292:31.75]I've marked three key locations.
[292:34.08]Placing the explosives there will take the whole place down.
[292:39.13]It's like TikTok level acting.
[292:51.48]Plant three bombs to destroy the entire compound.
[292:53.60]Plant the first bomb in the implant ops.
[292:56.76]Okay.
[293:02.32]You're really loading me up here.
[293:04.91]Medical kit.
[293:05.55]I need a bigger kit than that.
[293:08.33]A lot of... Alright.
[293:11.38]Are they going to be in the inventory?
[293:12.96]I can't reach that.
[293:19.32]Who's coming in?
[293:20.02]Who's coming in the door?
[293:24.25]None of that stuff was even in here.
[293:29.73]Nothing else?
[293:30.25]I just don't want to miss anything, because everyone will be saying, oh, he's blind.
[293:39.30]Compact streamer is too small to reach the big boy ammo.
[293:45.88]Get that guy out of here.
[294:05.73]Dead?
[294:06.57]Alright.
[294:07.13]I need to suck his head out.
[294:09.53]Oh, goddammit.
[294:12.73]Where... what is he... Just keep them all over here.
[294:19.97]Eventually they'll pile up in the corner.
[294:23.90]Pile up.
[294:25.70]I'm getting Messiah of Might and Magic flashbacks.
[294:31.92]Who the fuck has that gun?
[294:33.82]You do.
[294:40.71]Did he still shoot me?
[294:42.19]Even though he's on the ground on his back.
[294:47.32]He's the guy all the way across.
[294:50.26]What the fuck am I supposed to do about this guy?
[295:02.95]I can't hit this guy.
[295:15.39]What am I gonna do about this guy?
[295:28.87]Did I just shoot myself?
[295:54.43]Fuck!
[295:59.20]Where did I even just go?
[296:00.08]Oh, what was the last save point?
[296:07.46]It's right here, we're fine.
[296:10.96]I just gotta get out there and... I'm so aggravated.
[296:18.64]What do I... I placed the bomb in the implant facility.
[296:22.29]But first... I wish there was more than one.
[296:29.61]ResidentSleeper gameplay.
[296:32.23]It's alright!
[296:32.73]Does this game have music?
[296:38.08]Probably not.
[296:43.17]The question is, can I... Goodbye.
[296:57.68]Sniper rifle guy up there.
[296:58.78]He's still up there?
[297:01.26]Yep.
[297:05.01]Oh, you came a long way.
[297:13.29]Nice dodge.
[297:14.05]Almost got me.
[297:17.23]It was close.
[297:19.32]Alright, that guy's dead.
[297:26.94]Now the question is, where do I... Oh, no.
[297:29.90]Who?
[297:30.12]I don't see anybody.
[297:38.65]This was red before.
[297:39.51]Now where do I plant these bombs?
[297:45.85]In the Implant Room.
[297:48.53]Implant Offs.
[297:50.13]So I gotta go back to the Cryo Storage.
[297:56.79]And from the Cryo Storage I should be able to get to... Is there a fast way to get to the Cryo Storage?
[298:03.26]Who pressed that button?
[298:06.52]Oh, you've got it!
[298:07.38]This room was empty!
[298:11.06]Turn it off!
[298:11.58]Turn it off!
[298:11.92]Turn it off!
[298:23.95]Everything's fine.
[298:25.73]I'm gonna have full health.
[298:31.70]Let's head this way.
[298:42.80]Alright, cryogenically frozen place.
[298:50.02]Which is...
[298:53.50]I gotta go back through the vents.
[298:58.70]So I have to go down, right?
[298:59.82]No, up.
[299:00.78]I don't know.
[299:02.48]Which room is it in?
[299:07.65]There's almost 6k viewers all of a sudden?
[299:09.09]Yeah, that kind of came out of nowhere, huh?
[299:13.05]Well, hi guys, welcome.
[299:19.05]Kind of just jumped in view.
[299:19.79]Maybe a host or a raid?
[299:20.73]Did I miss a host or something?
[299:22.03]Maybe?
[299:23.77]Possible.
[299:25.69]Well, wherever you came from.
[299:26.47]Good to see you.
[299:30.47]My name's, uh... My name's Jeremy.
[299:39.94]It was Vinny?
[299:42.04]Oh, well, hello.
[299:42.64]Thanks, Vinny.
[299:44.92]I was gonna raid Vinny last night, but he was turning his stream off.
[299:49.98]We were ending at the same time.
[299:51.00]I was gonna... send some love.
[299:58.06]Just go through here.
[299:58.62]I was already in this room.
[300:07.56]I have just deja vu again.
[300:08.80]I at least have to get to the first boss.
[300:22.26]Walked right off the edge.
[300:23.64]They're not that bright.
[300:24.72]But then again, neither am I. What's on your back?
[300:31.74]Alright, I gotta get back.
[300:47.35]I swear, you guys are just spawning in random places.
[300:56.69]That has to be, right?
[300:57.53]What are you doing?
[301:05.21]What are you doing?
[301:05.67]There.
[301:10.13]Alright.
[301:12.13]Where are those vents?
[301:20.73]Alright, help me out here, chat.
[301:22.75]How do I get back to the cryogenically frozen laboratory?
[301:27.20]I went through the vent, and then I have to go back through the vents, right?
[301:33.62]Do I have to go up again?
[301:35.56]Is access denied?
[301:42.29]Just go.
[301:44.31]Go north-left.
[301:50.83]Jump down!
[301:51.53]Alright, why did I think you guys were gonna actually help me?
[302:00.78]Run the elevator in administrator mode.
[302:07.39]Go that way.
[302:08.11]Wait, wait, wait.
[302:11.83]I've been in this room, like, five times.
[302:14.15]I have to stop this.
[302:18.48]This is nonsense.
[302:22.00]There's a vent up there.
[302:22.64]No.
[302:23.38]No.
[302:34.18]Everybody's so helpful I guess I'm just gonna go down and then go through that door He's got 6k viewers and he's stuck in the game
[302:58.06]What are they going to think about me?
[302:59.00]What are they going to say about me?
[302:59.90]They're going to say so many fucking things about me.
[303:01.60]This guy doesn't even know what's going on.
[303:03.06]I'm not going back and watching him again.
[303:04.06]I only want to watch a strip of the note about the fuck he's going.
[303:07.64]I was just trolling you guys.
[303:10.99]I was just having a little bit of fun with you.
[303:14.05]We've got to go this way.
[303:22.53]How did I end up in this room again?
[303:24.67]It's not possible.
[303:26.37]Is this a different room?
[303:30.15]No, we're good.
[303:31.62]Alright.
[303:32.76]Now... Back up here.
[303:39.65]Can I even make it up there?
[303:41.39]Oh, shit.
[303:41.93]I don't think I can make it up there.
[303:44.21]Wait, I need one more crate.
[304:02.69]Get in there.
[304:04.51]I'm out of power.
[304:06.14]Can I push it?
[304:06.76]2,000 people have vanished.
[304:28.20]Twitch bug.
[304:29.80]It was a Twitch bug.
[304:34.52]It has nothing to do with what's happening on screen.
[304:36.68]It was a bug on Twitch's end.
[304:38.24]Fuck.
[304:57.69]I love how somebody actually wrote, wow, that's actually kind of embarrassing.
[305:09.88]Wait, what about this little one?
[305:16.95]It was never meant to be.
[305:20.85]Alright, I got a little one.
[305:26.23]Okay, perfect.
[305:26.93]Here we go.
[305:31.29]Really?
[305:47.95]This is obviously not the right way.
[305:58.42]I don't know how to get back.
[306:03.82]Just go back across the bridge.
[306:09.41]Pull the crate down.
[306:15.10]Why did I have to get stuck here at this part when 50,000 viewers show up?
[306:22.27]God damn it.
[306:23.93]Oh, please.
[306:26.20]It was so easy.
[306:28.24]I was 5,000 IQ, negative IQ, trying to do this.
[306:46.60]Get up there quick!
[307:06.80]No!
[307:07.30]No!
[307:08.76]He's dropping viewers by the second!
[307:24.67]Where did that come from?
[307:26.15]Just get me out of here!
[307:28.65]Come here!
[307:29.01]Okay, I've... One, two, three... Oh, it's... It's plummeting!
[307:43.98]He's plummeting!
[307:46.98]No, it was a Twitch glitch!
[307:49.14]It was a Twitch bug!
[308:00.21]Oh, fuck you mad cats.
[308:03.55]And your non-pressure sensitive controller.
[308:15.93]What are you doing?! !
[308:40.48]Just please please but let me salvage what's still here It's time I made it worse
[309:06.52]6,000 down to 3,600.
[309:06.88]Oh no, I have to do this again.
[309:10.14]No, I don't, actually.
[309:37.05]Oh, I had it too.
[309:37.81]It wasn't supposed to go that way.
[309:39.51]It was supposed to wrap around some other way.
[309:40.97]He's devolving.
[309:48.09]That's so funny to me.
[309:55.30]I can't even play.
[310:17.10]Okay.
[310:19.24]So it's obvious that I can't go this way.
[310:28.66]So I have to... Like, I don't know where the hell I'm supposed to go through here then.
[310:31.42]I don't know.
[310:32.72]It doesn't make any sense to me.
[310:34.70]Quick, advertise your shirts.
[310:35.86]Hey, you know I have shirts.
[310:50.09]Stock is plummeting.
[310:51.77]No, it's just fine.

[311:36.61]I'm just going to put it in.
[311:40.84]Before my value as a streamer drops like another 30%.
[311:44.50]Quickly.
[311:44.86]PsyOps is a fucking fun game.
[311:53.75]Interesting game.
[311:54.31]It was a fun experience.
[311:55.89]Maybe you'd play the whole thing.
[311:58.19]I'm just going to put Jackass in.
[312:09.51]I don't even know what this game is, but I'm just gonna put it in.
[312:27.14]Views dropped by like another 40% after Jackass.
[312:46.62]That is so funny.
[312:57.35]Yeah, I know it's because of the host turned off, but it's still absolutely hilarious how that played out.
[313:14.76]Alright, let's just, uh... I'm probably going to ride down a hill in a shopping cart or something.
[313:20.02]Game features stunts performed by professionals.

[313:52.27]He's playing, he's playing jackass.
[313:58.15]He's doing it funny.
[314:01.07]Slowly going down the hill.

[314:26.35]Urban Chaos is a funny one.
[314:27.82]It's cool.
[314:28.28]It's a classic.
[314:35.30]Isn't that what people told me?
[314:36.02]That it was a good game?

[315:53.80]It appears our city is under attack.

[316:18.16]That's one of my favorite 2019 scream moments already, is that.
[316:23.22]The last 15 to 20 minutes.

[317:11.84]Rocksteady and Eidos.
[317:13.08]I'm gonna turn that off.
[317:23.09]Sure, we'll be Nick Mason.
[317:31.23]Oh my god, my head hurts.
[317:34.11]That was too much stimulation.
[317:44.09]Hello?
[317:44.87]Um, what, is something wrong here?
[317:48.85]It doesn't do anything.
[317:53.45]Dolby Prologic 2.

[318:35.44]Tingle player.
[318:36.64]Veteran.
[318:43.04]Channel 7 News.
[318:53.15]This is Lanny York for Channel 7 News.
[318:55.65]It appears our city is under attack.
[318:58.00]At 5 this morning, an explosion ripped through Grand Plaza Station.
[319:01.90]Hundreds of early morning commuters and station staff are reportedly dead.
[319:05.54]Jesus Christ.
[319:07.78]Reports that the explosion was a terror attack have been confirmed.
[319:11.94]Two separate Middle Eastern extremist fundamentalist groups are claiming responsibility.
[319:17.22]In an emergency meeting this morning, government officials have decided to increase the city's lockdown with a strict curfew and immediate no-go areas.
[319:25.99]It appears gang warfare is escalating with groups such as the Burners, which reportedly has 200 members and is growing.
[319:33.79]We have not seen T-Zero, the new multi-million dollar riot response unit.
[319:38.27]No, this is not jackass.
[319:40.29]Channel 7 News said T-Zero is ready to hit the streets later today.
[319:44.24]Okay, somebody came to the stream.
[319:45.42]Somebody came to the stream.
[319:46.52]When I was doing the jackass and then they left.
[319:48.04]I'm gonna mute.
[319:48.62]We're getting reports that Hope Street police station is under attack by armed terrorists.
[319:54.52]That station is where T-Zero is temporarily based.
[320:12.69]This is T-Zero's first real test.
[320:15.05]We'll have more on this and other late-breaking details later.
[320:19.11]Channel 7, first for news in your city.
[320:21.69]I thought this was jackass.
[320:27.97]It's like a horrible fucking... What the fuck?
[320:32.91]No, it's not jackass!
[320:47.22]This is me?
[320:47.58]This is a first person shooter?
[320:49.52]How do I play?
[320:50.52]Reload?
[320:50.88]It's so crusty.
[321:20.39]Who am I shooting at?
[321:21.45]I can't.
[321:32.77]I can't.
[321:34.11]I've lost it.
[321:35.13]I've lost all function.
[321:36.39]In fact, if somebody thinks that I'm...
[321:52.86]Press triangle?
[321:53.63]What does triangle do?
[321:54.75]Why do I have a cleaver?
[322:07.23]Did I get him?
[322:22.66]The scout.
[322:24.12]This looks badass.
[322:29.42]This is... Rocksteady made this game.
[322:31.42]This is not just a couple of crusties, you know what I mean?
[322:34.88]You did great, Mason.
[322:36.64]I knew you'd be a fine addition to T-Zero.
[322:39.78]Go in that room and grab a riot shield.
[322:46.91]Pick up a riot shield.
[322:48.01]Alright, I got a mask.
[322:51.00]Okay, got one.
[322:51.72]L1 is shield.
[322:52.88]R1 is bash.
[323:03.19]Stun gun?
[323:03.55]Where did that guy come from?
[323:05.09]Stun gun.
[323:42.18]They're all dressed in like outfits.
[323:45.23]I didn't know.
[323:45.77]I thought there was a bad guy.
[323:47.61]He's running at us with an axe.
[323:53.23]That guy didn't die last time.
[324:01.99]The jackass thing has got me.
[324:03.84]All twisted.
[324:05.48]Alright, I'm gonna relax.
[324:08.32]I'm gonna relax.
[324:09.22]Don't shoot anybody.
[324:43.36]R3 is zoomed.
[324:44.82]And unsightly.
[324:50.99]That's just fucking comedy, is what it is.
[324:58.75]This is actually a pretty good first-person shooter for being .
[325:02.38]How do I get health back?
[325:03.94]Hey, fuck you!
[325:04.36]Shit, it's blocked.
[325:28.90]I know how to get it.
[325:32.09]It's in here.
[325:34.75]Ugh.
[325:40.38]Alright, I'm collected again.
[325:41.63]I'm back to normal, I think.
[325:46.90]T-Zero is here to clean up this city.
[325:49.74]That shield is going to help keep you alive.
[325:52.22]So remember to damn well use it.
[325:54.44]You've also got a standard issue stun gun, which you can use to bring some of these bastards in alive and keep some heat off our backs.
[326:02.31]Why did I read that?
[326:05.05]I was fine.
[326:05.69]I was over it.
[326:16.79]at the exterior parking lot.
[326:19.43]This is Doug Johnson of FD-13.
[326:21.19]Mason, get back up top.
[326:22.32]There's a fireman waiting for you.
[326:24.48]OK.
[326:28.70]I'm almost dead.
[326:32.14]Is there a heal?
[326:37.70]OK, I got to go.
[326:41.50]Have you seen anything like this before?
[326:46.54]Alright, fireman.
[326:51.38]Back up here.
[326:52.14]There's a fireman up here.
[326:52.96]Alright, there's a fireman.
[326:58.65]Hey, over here!
[327:01.31]Hey, I was told to report to an Officer Mason.
[327:04.57]That you?
[327:05.63]Great.
[327:06.81]Come on, there's a door over there.
[327:09.13]I'll go break it down for you.
[327:10.67]You watch my back.
[327:18.23]I saved him.
[327:20.51]Anybody else?
[327:25.29]I'm almost dead.
[327:26.05]Are we supposed to go in here?
[327:29.47]I don't think we're supposed to go in there.
[327:32.81]Do we go in?
[327:48.32]Oh, thank God.
[327:49.90]Alright, Johnson, let's go.
[327:58.09]We need Johnson in here.
[328:00.95]Thanks for that.
[328:01.93]So you're T-Zero then, huh?
[328:05.19]Cool.
[328:06.19]Guess that means you can order me around then, huh?
[328:09.24]That door over there is locked, but I think I can...
[328:13.22]Well, the whole building's on fire, so I would get to it.
[328:15.16]What if the firemen break open the door?
[328:18.98]Okay.
[328:21.28]Flashlight can be used with single-handed weapons, okay.
[328:30.03]Checkpoint.
[328:41.79]Alright.
[328:42.75]Use your shield to get past the jet.
[328:49.76]It worked.
[328:52.88]And then... Okay, now does this open?
[328:57.42]Who?
[329:00.45]That guy just threw an axe.
[329:02.73]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[329:06.05]Okay, here.
[329:06.79]I need you to open this door.
[329:11.52]Fireproof shields.
[329:12.20]I'm supposed to be condemned.
[329:13.00]No, no, I thought that was a high five.
[329:14.44]I was trying to high five the guy.
[329:17.10]You did a great job.
[329:18.90]Take care of that.
[329:46.79]Okay.
[329:46.99]Locker room.
[329:47.31]Locate the locker rooms.
[329:49.03]Somebody's gonna be on fire right here.
[329:50.79]Here they are.
[329:51.26]Got him.
[330:18.60]I need health Bad Hostage?
[330:30.63]I just got...
[330:47.34]I know.
[330:47.66]At least I have health now.
[330:55.26]Game.
[330:55.52]That was brutal.
[331:01.02]Game doesn't suck.
[331:01.88]Game is actually pretty fun.
[331:03.96]It's great.
[331:05.36]This is a really pretty good FPS for, you know, a long time ago.
[331:08.24]Think about how long ago this was.
[331:15.22]Can we stop playing this now?
[331:16.46]No, this is gonna be the last one.
[331:18.54]This is gonna be the last game of the night for now.
[331:21.30]I gotta get out of here.
[331:22.36]I burnt, like, my funny bone.
[331:28.44]It's gone.
[331:29.24]That was too funny.
[331:46.56]Sometimes you experience something that's just out of control.
[331:52.30]You kind of have to go to bed.
[331:56.99]Watch out for that guy.
[331:57.95]I got headshot from that far away?
[331:59.79]Nice.
[332:01.79]Watch out for this guy.
[332:17.06]Which one's the hostage?
[332:20.58]Medic?
[332:20.96]Medkit?
[332:21.32]Is that Medkit?
[332:22.74]Can I have that?
[332:24.32]Yes.
[332:24.40]Wait, wait, come here!
[332:25.08]Hey!
[332:45.66]Give me her!
[332:46.08]Give it!
[332:46.72]I need to be treated!
[332:47.42]Alright, let's go.
[332:48.10]That guy... Uh...
[333:15.48]Whoa!
[333:17.64]Okay, that was insane.
[333:20.18]Even though it's a console dogshit controls, it's really not that bad.
[333:24.84]It's actually kind of fun to shoot.
[333:26.30]Okay, gang leader.
[333:41.98]Stun him.
[333:42.22]Is this infinite?
[333:43.52]Do I just get to, like, Modern Warfare cheat right now?
[334:28.01]Got him!
[334:35.86]Non-lethal.
[334:36.66]Got it.
[334:37.24]Good guy.
[334:38.58]Okay, so now what's next?
[334:41.70]Probably out this door?
[334:44.92]Come here.
[335:00.30]What do you need?
[335:00.80]Okay.
[335:01.14]So I gotta take out the guy holding the hostage.
[335:34.70]Okay.
[335:34.82]We're fine.
[335:35.10]Hostage situation.
[335:35.74]He shot him in the head!
[336:05.90]Frank is down.
[336:06.50]Sidearm, sidearm.
[336:13.31]Okay, let's try it again.
[336:22.78]The perfect weapon.
[336:23.66]The Striever joke!
[336:36.67]Frank, no!
[336:37.17]Hey, it's me!
[336:37.99]I'm here!
[336:38.57]What?
[337:04.22]I shot him in the fucking head!
[337:06.62]Can you reload?
[337:21.87]Why do you keep whacking him in the head after getting shot in the face?
[337:36.59]Come on!
[337:36.97]Shoot him down!
[337:44.31]Wait!
[337:45.83]Was I supposed to do that?
[337:54.89]Oh, he's okay.
[337:55.45]Good.
[337:55.75]Listen, I'm going to tell everyone what a hero you are.
[337:59.19]I've never seen anyone take on a hostage situation like that.
[338:02.61]Thanks, man.
[338:03.69]Hey.
[338:06.91]Good.
[338:08.69]What does he got in here?
[338:09.33]Anything?
[338:12.18]Alright, nice.
[338:17.41]The FOV's not even killing me either.
[338:18.75]This would be so cool in 2006.
[338:19.51]Oh yeah, absolutely.
[338:20.13]It's cool now.
[338:20.67]Okay.
[338:44.10]This is Sally Taylor reporting live outside the Hope Street Police Building.
[338:48.72]Earlier this morning, this building was attacked by what local eyewitnesses describe as literally hundreds of homicidal maniacs.
[338:57.51]As you know, today was also the first day of active service for the mayor's new T-Zero anti-gang division.
[339:04.79]Are these two events linked?
[339:06.59]Who knows for certain.
[339:08.16]One thing is known, however.
[339:09.78]The siege ended when an officer in T-Zero saved the life of a fellow police officer, viciously held hostage by a Mr. Carl Estevez.
[339:19.66]Police have up to now refused to release any information.
[339:23.66]What if we all leave at once to force a Jerm market crash, then buy back in five minutes and get rich?
[339:29.93]73%?
[339:30.17]That's not bad.
[339:51.48]You have unlocked Emergency Downtown.
[339:55.65]Let's give it a try.
[340:04.11]Rescue the VIP trapped in the city streets to permanently unlock prototype T-Zero weaponry.
[340:10.24]Alright.
[340:11.34]Let's go.
[340:11.66]Mason.
[340:14.27]A transceiver discovered on the gang members has confirmed recent intelligence that a top-secret VIP vital to the city's survival is being held hostage in this location by gang members.
[340:25.81]Only T-Zero is able to respond, so you're going in solo.
[340:29.91]During the mission, you will have access to non-approved T-Zero prototype weaponry.
[340:34.54]If you succeed, it will cut a lot of red tape, so you get to keep them permanently.
[340:39.30]Stay sharp, Razor.
[340:55.43]I thought he just accidentally slit his own throat.
[341:00.89]Jerry, you gotta hold the blade the other way.
[341:03.88]Blade out.
[341:06.36]Ooh, new gun.
[341:09.20]I have three minutes of... Okay, time limit.
[341:38.39]Oh, I can't see.
[341:39.03]I think I'm good.
[341:44.88]Where are they?
[341:45.32]Downtown somewhere?
[341:46.42]Where are they?
[341:57.15]Little shortcut right there.
[342:04.68]Two minutes and thirty seconds to the end.
[342:12.14]Oh, shit.
[342:13.46]That's a lot of people up there.
[342:14.38]God damn it.
[342:26.77]I'm out of bullets.
[342:35.96]Oh, he's still alive.
[342:36.82]How?
[342:37.00]Alright.
[342:43.10]Minute 53.
[342:43.76]I can make it.
[342:50.63]Nope.
[342:51.93]Oh, losing time.
[343:04.53]I rescued you.
[343:09.57]Get to the helicopter in the town square.
[343:11.39]Oh shit.
[343:16.03]Oh no.
[343:20.58]Let's go.
[343:20.88]We gotta go.
[343:21.32]We gotta go.
[343:21.74]Follow me.
[343:22.88]Come on.
[343:25.50]Down here.
[343:43.00]Wait, wait, wait!
[343:49.01]Don't go in the fire.
[343:52.13]45 seconds remaining.
[344:00.23]Come on.
[344:06.32]Got it.
[344:07.06]Bingo.
[344:15.94]This is like one of those on-rails arcade shooters, but you can move.
[344:21.48]How would you get arrests there?
[344:26.96]They're like their own little packages.
[344:28.68]They're good.
[344:31.08]So it's an FPS.
[344:32.00]Yeah, I'm just... That's true.
[344:37.23]So you get more points for non-lethal.
[344:41.51]You have unlocked the Shotgun Mark I.
[344:51.65]The Riot Shield mechanic is really interesting even now in 2019.
[344:53.92]Now it's cool.
[344:59.82]West side canals.
[345:00.60]Let's see what this one is.
[345:08.29]This is Channel 7 News.
[345:12.59]This is Lani York for Channel 7 News.
[345:15.31]It was one of the worst attacks to date by gangs.
[345:17.99]Hope Street Police Station and the emergency workers stationed there survived an all-out assault last month.
[345:24.37]T-Zero assisted officers in defending the station and made many of the 56 arrests that day.
[345:30.23]One of the gang's most notorious leaders, Estevez, was killed.
[345:35.00]Civil Defense Committee has seen this lady on five right now.
[345:38.56]You have 25 years ago and coordinated Investigation into the gang 2006 has been kept highly confidential Investigators have not released any of the gangs 14 years ago objectives, but these gangs have shown they are an army on a mission and
[345:54.15]several large corporations are aiding police by notifying them of any suspicious employees or employee actions these companies include the accounts giant was not around in 2006 and the energy conglomerate shiny energy
[346:10.19]34 arrests have been made so far based on tips from these employers.
[346:14.37]Many employees are being questioned after homemade weapons and explosives were found on company premises.
[346:20.78]If you suspect someone you know to be a gang member, please contact your local police department.
[346:26.48]Meanwhile, the new riot response unit, T-Zero, has been deemed a partial success.
[346:31.93]In just one month, T-Zero has made more than 90 gang-related arrests.
[346:36.21]And last month, more than 200 people with ties to gangs were sent to prison.
[346:40.69]That's the highest figure since 2002.
[346:43.53]Nick Mason, who's a T-Zero enforcer, has been dubbed the Angel of Hope Street by local police for his work in defending the station.
[346:52.12]Even so, public opinion is still mixed about T-Zero.
[346:55.49]Many feel it hasn't earned its multimillion dollar price tag.
[347:00.44]I'm getting word of a terror attack at the south side canals.
[347:04.39]Police have quarantined and evacuated the area, but some police and medical teams are trapped.
[347:10.31]It appears they were lured to the docks with false 911 calls.
[347:14.97]T-Zero and police backup are en route.
[347:17.67]Channel 7's news chopper is at the scene and can confirm that hostages have been taken.
[347:22.46]We'll have more on this story as it unfolds.
[347:25.42]Channel 7, first for news in your city.
[347:31.22]There's a lot going on there.
[347:32.22]Okay.
[347:34.04]Westside canals.
[347:34.72]We got an extra pistol clip.
[347:40.44]This city sucks.
[347:41.86]There's literally a breaking news alert about a terrorist attack during the report about the terrorist attack yesterday.
[347:47.79]Jesus.
[347:48.19]It's fucking horrible.
[347:57.10]Let's get in.
[347:59.32]What is this?
[348:02.28]Like, 12 FPS?
[348:07.43]Locate the medical team.
[348:17.35]Got a cleaver.
[348:17.87]Can I break out of here?
[348:19.55]Shoot this?
[348:23.47]Locate the medical team.
[348:36.43]Medical team?
[348:38.70]How is that unauthorized force?
[348:45.70]Wait, arrest!
[348:46.44]Good idea.
[348:49.30]Alright, did I do that, or did he get the fire thrown at him?
[349:07.21]Alright, you're under arrest.
[349:08.05]Okay.
[349:08.19]Can you heal me?
[349:10.91]Give me health back.
[349:11.45]Thank you!
[349:12.21]Okay, let's get down here, find the medical team.
[349:39.62]You know, you could have dropped behind me, instead of in front of me.
[349:41.66]You could have gone the other way, and you would have had a... you would have had to jump on me so well.
[349:44.62]It would have been really, really good.
[349:46.02]That was a bad plan.
[349:53.59]Let's try... I want to try the cleaver for a minute.
[350:13.53]Okay, locate and rescue the captured medic.
[350:16.55]It says R2 to throw cleaver.
[350:18.55]Oh.
[350:18.61]Well, I have the shield up.
[350:20.68]Well, that makes sense.
[350:25.14]Mates, I'm circling the first warehouse.
[350:45.21]Swarming.
[350:45.89]Dark Souls enemy?
[350:46.98]Yep.
[350:47.20]There's a lot going on right now.
[350:53.42]Am I?
[351:17.57]Uh oh.
[351:18.85]Bad.
[351:19.11]This is bad.
[351:19.95]You're gonna die!
[351:27.04]You're gonna die!
[351:29.92]I'm dead.
[351:36.74]Shit.
[351:39.04]You'll be sorry you fucked with me.
[351:40.86]No one's gonna miss you.
[351:41.92]Get back, man.
[351:47.73]He didn't bring nine cleavers.
[351:51.21]Yeah, my standard issue.
[351:54.18]You get your MK1 shotgun, your 9mm with two clips, and nine kitchen cleavers.
[352:05.36]Standard issue.
[352:13.27]I think I fell down the stairs.
[352:24.32]Oh, fuck.
[352:41.59]Okay.
[352:42.99]How we doing?
[352:43.33]There's a gang leader I have to take out.
[352:48.00]Bring him in alive.
[352:52.20]These are the real hours.
[352:54.02]These are the chat hours.
[352:55.90]Yeah, everybody sold off their Jerma985 stock.
[353:03.06]But you guys held.
[353:04.60]You held on to it!
[353:06.40]I'm dying.
[353:10.62]Who's dying?
[353:20.38]Whoops, is that the gang leader?
[353:23.26]I didn't know.
[353:23.82]I couldn't tell from back here.
[353:31.90]Is Tara okay?
[353:39.07]Kill him and let God sort him out.
[353:41.07]God sort him out.
[353:42.37]What are we supposed to do about this?
[354:06.28]Uh-oh, there's Garry's Mod items in here.
[354:08.82]Be careful.
[354:09.52]Yes.
[354:10.08]Watch out for the Garry's Mod funny thing.
[354:20.60]What's now?
[354:20.94]What are we doing?
[354:21.94]Clear the canal of all gang activity.
[354:34.95]Oh, those are some hee-hee funny items.
[354:37.95]They were.
[354:44.59]Um... Can you duck in a better place?
[354:51.51]You don't have to give me that stupid cutscene.
[354:58.93]Alright, come here.
[355:02.75]Heal me.
[355:03.05]Thank you.
[355:03.35]I only got one more.
[355:06.07]That's fine.
[355:07.07]I'm not even gonna need it.
[355:08.77]Is it safe?
[355:09.93]Not yet.
[355:10.49]Don't go there yet.
[355:11.17]Don't go there yet.
[355:36.45]Watch out!
[355:38.43]He just ran right into that.
[355:43.39]Move out of the way.
[356:00.62]Wow.
[356:02.66]Unbelievable.
[356:10.14]Okay.
[356:29.67]Almost there.
[356:33.69]I would explode that accidentally, so I'm glad I just made that happen.
[356:39.33]Where's the extraction point?
[356:47.91]Oh, the wounded guy, right.
[356:56.48]I'm on it.
[356:57.68]Is that using one of my health packs?
[357:00.72]Order complete.
[357:05.96]You good?
[357:07.23]I'm right here.
[357:08.21]Tell me.
[357:08.43]Locate the owner of the warehouse.
[357:10.41]Sure.
[357:10.98]Owner of the warehouse.
[357:14.02]I gotta arrest some people.
[357:15.06]Seriously.
[357:15.42]That guy was just immolating.
[357:39.53]Somebody has to be... I gotta arrest, like, a few people to make more money.
[357:47.89]He actually does breathe fire.
[357:50.27]I'm arrested.
[357:57.42]Uh, he fell into that.
[357:58.40]I didn't do it, so I still get non-lethal.
[358:06.28]It's back.
[358:06.82]Looks like the power has been shut off...
[358:12.44]Whoops.
[358:12.92]Forget about... Just kill them.
[358:18.01]Oh, I know.
[358:21.25]Who's cheering?
[358:42.70]Shoot him when he reloads, you idiot!
[358:46.56]You're talking to the guy that's trying to save your life.
[358:51.20]Oh, I wanna- you are really being annoying.
[359:28.14]No.
[359:29.46]You took your time.
[359:31.41]Hey, you're that T-Zero guy.
[359:34.35]I'm sticking with you till this place is safe.
[359:39.83]I should be able to reset it in the basement storeroom.
[359:45.87]I need health.
[359:48.59]OK, he needs to tase him a little for being mean.
[359:51.94]OK, I'm OK with that.
[359:54.74]You do that again, and I'll report you.
[360:02.16]Okay, we gave him a little shock.
[360:08.06]I'm gonna die.
[360:08.66]Is there a checkpoint?
[360:11.86]So we need to go down to... He needs to reconnect the power.
[360:19.96]Well, that's all fine and dandy here.
[360:22.66]I'm trying to turn on the flashlight.
[360:25.16]You can clearly see that I'm trying to figure out how the flashlight gets turned back on.
[360:42.31]It's not... I thought it was like R3 or L3.
[360:43.68]It's R2.
[360:44.00]It's not R2.
[360:47.60]That's shoot gun.
[360:48.28]It's not R1 either.
[360:48.94]What is it?
[360:49.52]Up on the D-pad.
[361:10.16]You're the pitch black guy.
[361:12.36]I need a one-handed weapon.
[361:18.69]Okay.
[361:19.51]In the basement.
[361:20.03]Let's go.
[361:21.39]Follow me.
[361:30.45]I thought I told you I need to turn the power back on.
[361:34.65]The switch is back there in the basement.
[361:49.38]So did we go the wrong way?
[361:52.18]Or is there a basement to go down?
[362:05.44]Turn it on.
[362:11.16]What are you talking about?
[362:13.66]What did you just do?
[362:18.42]What did you do?
[362:18.96]Are you...
[362:40.89]Was it up there?
[362:41.55]That was weird.
[362:50.93]Do something.
[362:55.74]The power is cut.
[362:59.22]How do I get down to the basement?
[363:00.30]Can you do this one?
[363:02.90]Try that one.
[363:14.57]How do I get to the basement?
[363:17.95]I think I just have to go back to where we just were.
[363:32.43]Like, down here?
[363:33.05]This is definitely it.
[363:38.46]Yeah, there it is.
[363:40.40]Alright, repair that, please.
[363:44.67]I would appreciate it.
[363:47.01]Sir.
[363:59.65]Come on.
[364:00.91]Will do.
[364:09.82]Good.
[364:10.10]Alright, gonna go back to the warehouse.
[364:13.12]Juice it.
[364:41.59]Alright, now we can go back down.
[364:46.52]Can I just jump over this?
[365:24.84]Thank God.
[365:30.31]No, I have to go back and do that again!
[365:32.41]No, I don't.
[365:40.33]Where's this coming from?
[365:41.63]How do I have that many hands?
[365:47.49]I have to go rescue this guy again.
[365:50.81]No, what?
[365:52.23]Yeah, I do.
[366:06.62]Alright, that's it.
[366:09.81]I'm done.
[366:10.21]That's the end of the stream.
[366:11.67]So there are...
[366:35.92]There are three days in a row of PlayStation 2 madness.
[366:45.87]Oh, that was so fucking funny.
[366:48.21]Thank you all for joining me.
[366:50.47]We're going to go back to Vive next week.
[366:55.97]So technically it is next week for a lot of you guys.
[367:01.75]I still have a couple... I have, like, Shadow of Rome is another one that I'm gonna play, but that's like a whole stream.
[367:10.88]I've also got... the 50 Cent game is gonna be a long time, so we're gonna... I've got a few other good ones.
[367:23.19]Thank you for hanging out for the last three days.
[367:27.10]My funny bone is a little drained, especially the last two nights.
[367:31.16]God.
[367:35.56]Thank you, everybody.
[367:37.48]I'm going to pick back up.
[367:40.58]Not for... I'm going to take a day or two off here.
[367:44.16]I've got some stuff around the house I need to take care of.
[367:47.26]So you will see me again.
[367:48.44]Boing, boing on Wednesday.
[367:51.72]We're going to go back to the Vive on Wednesday.
[367:54.85]Probably going to do Mindshow.
[367:59.14]Because that's something I want to spend a lot of time on.
[368:03.48]Cube World.
[368:06.30]Oh, you guys killed me.
[368:08.10]Like, 45 minutes ago.
[368:12.90]That was... Just so funny.
[368:19.30]Alright, you play Cube World.
[368:22.00]Ugh.
[368:29.65]I'm gonna be laughing about that in like another hour.
[368:31.69]I'm gonna be downstairs sitting on the couch and I'm just gonna laugh about the fucking stream viewer count just plummeting.
[368:43.40]Anywho, let's get to the bits.
[368:44.74]I'll see you guys in a couple days.
[368:46.94]See you guys on Wednesday.
[368:48.78]And we're gonna move to the bits.
[368:57.03]See you for more Vive.
[369:01.06]change this a little.
[369:11.47]Do VRChat?
[369:12.85]That's another one that's going to happen.
[369:13.85]Probably not on Wednesday though because I really want to get a good avatar for that.
[369:22.25]And I want to... I was going to play it with Kiwo probably.
[369:25.58]She was going to show me the ropes.
[369:30.44]Potentially.
[369:35.74]A custom Jerma avatar.
[369:41.08]Be careful with VRChat.
[369:42.38]I'll be very careful.
[369:44.53]I'll be very, very careful.
[369:47.97]Or who knows?
[369:48.71]We'll see if I even play it.
[369:52.07]But let's go back to six hours ago.
[369:57.07]See you soon.
[369:58.01]Thanks for sticking around.
[369:59.47]We're going to put the... Put the PlayStation 2 back on the shelf for a little while.
[370:04.67]Come back to it maybe in a couple weeks.
[370:06.80]For Shadow of Rome.
[370:08.48]I also need to... I want to play the... I actually want to play the new Stuntman.
[370:13.42]The one that was updated for PS3.
[370:17.64]Too much stuff to do.
[370:20.49]But thank you Divus for the $2.50.
[370:24.30]Thank you for the $2.50.
[370:27.44]Ah, thank you, Nate, for the $2.50.
[370:30.52]Uh... Nate, nice real name, no gimmick.
[370:34.54]Two compact men go around the outside.
[370:37.17]Around the outside, around the outside.
[370:39.39]Oh, it's Eminem.
[370:43.63]Thank you, Nate.
[370:46.75]With more slim, shady lyrics.
[370:50.04]Thank you, TheOtherRust, for the three bucks.
[370:52.44]Hey, Jerma, I'm the same guy that spammed you to play Dark Messiah of Might and Magic a couple years ago, and now I'm back to tell you that you have to play Thimbleweed Park.
[371:00.47]I can't rest until you have jermaPluto, Frank or Z. Thimbleweed Park.
[371:07.02]What is this?
[371:07.30]Let me just look this up.
[371:13.28]Some other people were talking about this, too.
[371:14.64]Thimbleweed Park.
[371:16.94]Thimbleweed Park.
[371:20.36]It's a point-and-click adventure game developed by Ron Gilbert.
[371:24.92]Oh, it's a point-and-click game.
[371:30.30]Okay.
[371:33.39]I really... I was into those for a while.
[371:35.85]We played a handful of those in a row.
[371:38.61]Is that a good stream game?
[371:46.08]It's free right now.
[371:48.98]It's going to be free on the Epic Games Store.
[371:51.90]Oh, that's interesting.
[371:58.99]If you're streaming it, it'll always be a good stream.
[372:01.35]Well, that's a very nice thing to say.
[372:02.71]Thank you.
[372:05.85]I'm going to see... I should probably get a couple of point-and-click games to have back-to-back for a little while.
[372:17.48]That chatter was lying.
[372:19.50]But thank you, Other Us, for the suggestion.
[372:20.92]Appreciate it.
[372:26.25]Thank you to Nate again for the $2.50.
[372:27.77]When am I going to play Call of Duty World at War for PS2?
[372:35.26]It's the fourth worst COD game of all time.
[372:40.40]Call of Duty World at War Final Fronts.
[372:45.83]I love how that's the fourth worst rated COD game.
[372:54.82]I probably won't play it.
[372:56.90]But thank you for the $2.50.
[372:57.74]Thank you, Nate, again for $3.00.
[373:01.91]After deleting the EdEdNetty save file... Uh, I'm gonna go Office Space on your PS2.
[373:07.19]Uh...
[373:15.52]No one's touching this thing.
[373:17.80]This thing is staying right where it is.
[373:19.00]It ain't gonna move.
[373:24.51]I had to flush at Ed and Eddie to make room for psyops.
[373:31.90]This is my PS2.
[373:34.32]And it's staying here.
[373:35.42]And no one's gonna break it.
[373:39.90]But thank you.
[373:42.03]Thank you, Red... Thank you, RedLipCoder, for the $10.
[373:46.47]Thanks for the $10.
[373:48.59]Hey, Jerma, would you be interested in playing the Jak and Daxter collection on stream?
[373:57.30]I don't know.
[373:57.84]I don't... Probably not.
[374:07.35]Jak and Daxter.
[374:11.36]They are really good games.
[374:13.06]I just don't know if I have the... sort of the patience to stream the whole things.
[374:17.87]They are very good.
[374:23.13]But with all the... the same thing people are asking for Spyro 2.
[374:27.94]I don't know if I have the patience really to sit there and play like Spyro 1, 2, and 3 remastered.
[374:33.66]I don't know.
[374:33.98]I feel like if you do one, you kind of have to do them all, don't you?
[374:40.54]They're very good games.
[374:42.56]I just don't know if they would be streams that I would want to do.
[374:49.39]Dermot refuses to play good games in favor of random old games.
[374:52.33]Jak and Dexter is also old, so is Spyro.
[374:54.13]They just happened to remake them.
[375:01.93]Spyro fucking sucks.
[375:03.98]Look at how polarized this is.
[375:13.14]I didn't say that.
[375:16.38]But, thank you for the 10 bucks.
[375:20.73]Thank you Nate for the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, holy shit dude.
[375:22.53]You donated like 15 times in a row.
[375:24.45]Thank you for the 250, like, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
[375:44.32]Nate coming in with a shitload.
[375:49.81]Could you guess what they're asking me to do?
[376:00.11]It has something to do with Half-Life.
[376:05.99]They just wrote Half-Life like 15 times.
[376:16.98]Thank you for the Half-Life, every Half-Life that's ever been invented.
[376:24.16]And then, have I ever heard of... The Daddy in Toothless, that one racing game.
[376:29.97]I have no idea what you mean.
[376:31.79]Absolutely no idea.
[376:34.67]Notice how the sexy lady and the police helicopter in the first cutscene missed every shot.
[376:40.00]I don't know.
[376:48.19]Uh, and then... This reminds me of a game I played.
[376:53.47]It's called Black Ops 2.
[376:56.17]They copied Black Ops 2.
[377:02.41]Uh, sorry to say, unfortunately, that this game came out probably 15 years before Black Ops 2.
[377:10.30]Whatever game it happened to be on screen.
[377:19.13]Thank you, Miss Melon Tea, for the 250.
[377:24.57]Hope you had a good stream today.
[377:25.59]Had a good time watching, as usual.
[377:26.93]Much love.
[377:28.34]Thank you, Miss Melon Tea.
[377:34.40]Appreciate it.
[377:38.22]Glad you had a good time.
[377:40.75]I had a good time.
[377:44.45]Also, Mostly Lost, thanks for the 250.
[377:47.30]Remember when you were gonna set aside 12 hours to stream without warning?
[377:52.90]Yeah... But I think, to my defense, the back of the box... It makes it seem like it's one of those... Interesting experiences where... It actually says you have 12 hours.
[378:07.98]The clock is ticking.
[378:13.99]I'm so glad I did not do that.
[378:16.59]That would have been terrible.
[378:19.41]StixRenegade, thanks for the 250.
[378:21.21]Two year sub, holy shit.
[378:23.61]You're worth every month I've subbed to you.
[378:25.11]Everyone give Jerma all the jermaHearts you have right fucking now.
[378:32.58]You already all do all the time, so.
[378:39.66]Thank you for the 250.
[378:40.70]Thanks for having fun.
[378:50.99]Really appreciate it.
[378:56.50]And by the way, it takes two years of subs.
[379:00.28]That's... two years in a row.
[379:04.66]I'm shocked that people are subscribed for that long.
[379:07.64]I have to start making new emote badge slot things.
[379:12.53]I never thought that that was going to happen.
[379:14.03]I thought that, you know, oh yeah, they'll make like the two-year one.
[379:17.31]No one's going to get that one.
[379:20.41]have to make more there are people that are still continuously subbing to this channel for years years in a row thank you I'm gonna have to get a three year a six year that's ah I can't believe it that's even remotely possible
[379:48.29]But thank you.
[379:48.81]Thank you, Frodeon, for the $5 again here, Frodeon.
[379:51.79]No drawing tonight, but if you're going to revisit PS2 games again, I highly suggest War of the Monsters.
[379:56.87]It's a fighting game styled after old-timey monster movies.
[380:01.01]Anyway, have a good night and keep kicking ass.
[380:03.04]Thank you, Frodeon.
[380:07.34]Yeah, I would definitely suggest anybody that has a recommendation, throw it, get it in that Discord channel.
[380:17.09]I check that recommended channel all the time.
[380:20.67]So if there's something you're like, oh, fuck, I got a couple of games that he would really like to play.
[380:25.71]Now, it's not guaranteed I'm going to play them, but that is the appropriate place for, you know, suggestions.
[380:32.78]Because it's cleaner, it's easier for me to see.
[380:35.12]I can just kind of scroll down and see it.
[380:43.70]But I've used that and a lot of streams have come from that recommended channel.
[380:48.32]A lot of them.
[380:51.78]War of the Monsters is on PS4.
[380:53.44]That's cool.
[380:55.98]Has like a digital download or something.
[381:01.16]But thank you, Frodeon.
[381:01.94]Appreciate it.
[381:04.25]The thing with the PS2 has so many games.
[381:09.68]I could sit here for a month straight and do this.
[381:13.12]I'm not gonna do that because obviously I want to break it up.
[381:16.80]You know, couple of streams in a row.
[381:18.66]Dreamcast!
[381:19.58]Two or three streams, come back to it maybe another time.
[381:21.87]Later in the year or something.
[381:22.85]PS2, come back to it another time.
[381:24.27]Because I don't want to get burnt out on like old, weird, interesting games.
[381:34.11]I'd rather do them a few times in a row, put it back in the box for a while, come back.
[381:41.67]But I will definitely be making another list.
[381:45.99]Hey, it's time for slime.
[381:46.75]Thanks for the $5.
[381:47.27]Just wanted to say I'm so proud of you for sticking through Clock Tower and beating it.
[381:53.39]I had a lot of fun last night.
[381:56.42]And this is awesome.
[382:09.76]I loved that game.
[382:11.00]It was bad.
[382:11.82]The game was like a little sloppy and shitty.
[382:16.37]But that was a full straight nine hours of fun.
[382:24.60]Thank you, It's Time for Slime, for that awesome gift.
[382:28.94]Nice trick.
[382:30.68]Right now, a hundred bucks just came in.
[382:36.09]Toshiro.TV, thanks for the hundred bucks.
[382:39.39]One hundred dollars.
[382:43.73]And they say, Hey Jerma, just got back from my birthday Vegas trip.
[382:48.88]Yeah, I'm looking forward to see how this went.
[382:51.28]We ended up in the green after all the gambling.
[382:54.31]So this is how I'm celebrating.
[382:55.69]Hell yeah.
[382:56.27]Nice.
[382:57.83]You made it out alive.
[382:58.89]You made it out alive.
[383:04.86]You made it in the green.
[383:06.30]Good.
[383:10.93]You beat the house.
[383:15.53]No, that's always a great feeling if you ever play any casino games.
[383:21.16]Being up is a lot better than being down.
[383:24.42]As all of us can probably say this.
[383:27.02]We can agree on that.
[383:29.33]But thanks for the 100 bucks, and they say, after that, also ended up going to Hash House Ogogo in the link per your recommendation.
[383:37.89]Uh-huh.
[383:39.30]Yeah.
[383:40.32]Oh, look at that thing.
[383:42.36]Yeah!
[383:43.32]Yes!
[383:44.56]Oh, yes.
[383:46.22]There it is.
[383:46.64]I got the burger.
[383:49.24]It was absolutely the most delicious burger I've ever had.
[383:52.58]Thanks for the info.
[383:54.58]Look at that fucking bad boy right there.
[384:07.05]That is the burger from Hash House A Go Go at the Link.
[384:12.19]Best burger I've ever had.
[384:16.21]So glad that you got to enjoy it.
[384:17.79]The place is awesome.
[384:20.70]And happy birthday.
[384:21.58]I'm glad your trip went amazing.
[384:23.16]That's awesome.
[384:24.02]Thank you.
[384:30.46]God, I want that burger right now.
[384:34.67]How do I get that right now?
[384:41.84]But moving on, we got, uh, what do we got here?
[384:49.25]Uh, thank you, Nate.
[384:51.27]Nate, again, for, uh, three, four, five, six, or seven donations in a row.
[384:56.21]About two, five, ten, twelve, fifteen dollars from Nate here.
[385:03.80]Thank you, Nate.
[385:05.32]And they say, what about chocolate milk every day?
[385:07.28]Don't drink chocolate.
[385:08.90]You don't ever drink milk every day.
[385:10.32]It's not good for you.
[385:16.23]You know?
[385:17.17]Too much of anything is bad for you.
[385:20.43]If all you ate was apples, it wouldn't be good for you.
[385:30.43]I love milk.
[385:31.01]Yeah, you can love milk.
[385:31.73]That's fine.
[385:32.09]But you drink it three, four, five times a day?
[385:34.69]Every day?
[385:35.13]You're gonna get milk poisoning.
[385:47.58]And then they also say... Legend has it the soldier is still free-falling.
[385:58.66]From PsyOps.
[386:04.95]It's a sentry gun, it's not a minigun.
[386:08.99]Once it sees you, you're as good as dead.
[386:10.59]Well, it's a minigun attached to a sensor that shoots the minigun bullets at you when you walk by it.
[386:16.21]It's a minigun with a robot built inside of its head.
[386:23.08]Think about that.
[386:25.64]Hey, Platadonius, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[386:28.98]Thank you.
[386:31.72]Jerma Dafoe, Willem Dafoe didn't get the Oscar.
[386:34.94]Aww.
[386:37.32]That's too bad.
[386:43.41]Willem Dafoe did not win for best actor.
[386:46.95]Spoiler alert.
[386:50.85]He's been doing it for a long time.
[386:52.28]He's been acting for a long time.
[386:54.14]Very long time.
[386:54.96]He's been very good.
[386:59.12]He's still our top banana.
[387:00.16]He sure is.
[387:05.10]Can you start a new stream after this one?
[387:06.64]I missed this one.
[387:08.18]Yeah, in two days.
[387:10.88]After this one ends in two days, I'll start a new one for you.
[387:15.30]We'll come back with VR.
[387:23.62]He was... Yeah, he was in Platoon too, wasn't he?
[387:25.79]No, he means right after this stream.
[387:41.51]Hey, GarfieldTheMondayKiller, thanks for the 250.
[387:45.84]Garfield's back in action.
[387:50.82]Take a look at this Garfin guy over here.
[387:52.52]Take a look at the most expensive Garfograph you've ever seen, Mr. Jerma.
[387:57.20]That is true.
[387:58.60]Unfortunately, because of the monumental bit reading price increase, Garf won't be around for every stream.
[388:04.78]Odie and I will still try to cook up some Garfographs when the stars align.
[388:09.96]Being the resonant cartoon in chat, Spider-Man...
[388:13.64]Into the Spider-Verse won Best Animation Oscar.
[388:16.00]Don't know if you saw it.
[388:16.82]I did.
[388:17.18]I actually did see it.
[388:19.11]But it's got action and heart and a pig Spider-Man.
[388:21.13]Garfield's favorite.
[388:23.39]I did see Into the Spider-Verse Garfield.
[388:25.21]Yeah, I thought it was very good.
[388:39.89]It's got some of the most intense, awesome animation.
[388:43.49]Characters are great.
[388:44.17]It's got good pacing.
[388:47.09]It's a great, yeah, it's a good movie.
[388:49.53]What did I do to Garfield?
[388:50.59]What happened?
[388:54.70]Uh, also Nate here.
[388:55.58]Nate, two, three, four, five, five, ten bucks from Nate.
[389:00.26]Uh, internet's going out.
[389:02.72]DirecTV told me.
[389:05.62]Back online.
[389:08.08]Wait, what, what's going on?
[389:15.41]Your internet's going out?
[389:16.79]Uh, I don't know.
[389:20.66]I... Maybe you should not... Nate, what is going on?
[389:30.98]There's one... Okay, one, two, three bit messages.
[389:36.00]250, 250, 250.
[389:39.54]Telling me that DirecTV told me my internet's gonna turn off.
[389:42.48]My internet's turning off now, and now I'm back.
[389:51.41]Hopefully you got it sorted out.
[390:00.96]But thank you, nonetheless.
[390:05.44]I'm back.
[390:06.00]I'm off.
[390:06.42]I'm back again.
[390:09.24]Thank you.
[390:14.55]He... Oh.
[390:15.29]Oh.
[390:16.27]Oh.
[390:19.15]Oh.
[390:36.03]Well, I guess we can take this opportunity to clearly state a few things.
[390:43.35]One, if you have been banned from this channel, all the mods are able to be spoken to about it.
[390:57.04]Two,
[390:59.84]If you have been banned and you come back with two, three, or four different accounts over and over again, that is actually against Terms of Service.
[391:12.09]So I just want to make sure everyone's aware of that.
[391:23.50]That shit's scary.
[391:28.48]You can get banned off of all of Twitch for that, for your information.
[391:31.10]Can you really?
[391:36.09]If you think that maybe it shouldn't have been banned, maybe bring it up with the mods, but the mods have authority, right?
[391:47.18]There's the motorbike going by again.
[392:03.35]Uh, but if, like I said before, there are rules, they're not, we like to have a laid-back environment here, but if you have been banned or removed, and you come back and you tell everybody you were, or you come back again and you come back again, and somebody finds out, uh, sorry, but, you know, we have to keep things going here.
[392:41.13]if you ever fail a Jupiter you get permaban that's not true but to close it out uh Nate thank you for the money thank you for the 250 a bunch of times hopefully you can get your sorted out
[393:04.06]You gave a lot of money.
[393:06.30]And I don't want to just say, Hey, bye!
[393:10.27]But, we got rules, man.
[393:11.79]Gotta follow them.
[393:22.04]But, thank you.
[393:23.88]Thank you also to Mostly Lost.
[393:28.62]For the $2.50. $2.50.

[393:57.84]Really appreciate it, guys.
[393:58.80]Thank you.
[394:10.84]Let's bring up the credits.
[394:18.52]And take a look.
[394:23.17]Hey!
[394:23.55]Thanks everybody for subbing.
[394:25.35]All the new subs, all the old subs, you guys are fucking awesome.
[394:32.03]I missed most of the stream.
[394:32.90]Did you finally finish the JermaCraft Adventures?
[394:36.18]Yes.
[394:44.07]I beat Minecraft.
[394:44.85]I beat the Ender Dragon.
[394:50.41]Got to see the whole thing.
[394:51.09]It was cool.
[394:56.93]Am I going to go to PAX West?
[394:58.27]I am not going to be going to PAX West.
[395:01.09]In fact, my convention trips will be pretty limited.
[395:08.55]I'm not sure exactly where I'm going to be going this year.
[395:12.16]We'll find out.
[395:15.05]I was lying, I watched the whole stream, you told me a lie.
[395:18.85]Well, then call me out on it.
[395:32.58]Lying stream, there you go, see, call me out.
[395:51.84]How to delete a liar's Twitch.
[396:00.17]What do you mean delete a liar's Twitch?
[396:02.33]You can't.
[396:12.94]Will you be going to the furry convention in Alaska?
[396:17.52]Uh, probably not.
[396:38.06]He read it.
[396:43.64]I'm already there!
[396:45.34]Just look down the hall, see?
[397:04.83]He's in his rat costume.
[397:09.88]He's chasing me!
[397:10.74]What would you guys do, if seriously, if I got in a full rat costume at a furry convention, and it was just like running around on all fours?
[397:23.41]How would you ever know that?
[397:24.23]None of you guys would ever know that was me.
[397:32.25]Somebody's like, oh, there's like a rat running around!
[397:34.05]Oh, it's your Jerma985, right guys?
[397:36.67]And it actually is me.
[397:44.52]I kind of want to do that.
[397:46.56]And just see if it can get recorded, like, being a rat.
[397:50.92]And then go into, like, the bathroom and, like, change clothes and, like, leave.
[397:55.41]No one would ever know and I could deny it every day.
[398:09.35]Now I assume everyone in a furry costume is just you.
[398:24.25]You'd get found out in two minutes.
[398:25.77]No, I would not.
[398:26.95]If I was in a full fursuit, nobody would be able to know it was me.
[398:31.79]If I didn't take off the helmet.
[398:36.57]I'd hire like a limousine company with the tinted windows.
[398:41.63]I'd pull up in the limo.
[398:44.29]I'd get out in full costume.
[398:47.22]I wouldn't talk.
[398:51.28]Just walk around.
[398:54.12]Wave, crawl around, like wave.
[398:57.98]An hour or two goes by, get back in the limo, roll up the windows.
[399:04.68]Once there, at least a mile away from the convention hall, then I take off the suit.
[399:12.93]How would anybody know that was me?
[399:25.29]Because of the limo driver.
[399:26.87]Fuck.
[399:27.57]Alright, what if I... Okay, what if the limo driver drops me off at a hotel... No, the limo driver drops me off at an undisclosed location like a mile away from my hotel.
[399:37.72]Then the limo driver leaves.
[399:39.28]I wait 30 seconds to make sure he goes past the first intersection with the light added.
[399:43.58]He goes through it.
[399:46.59]Then I go into the hotel.
[399:49.17]I walk to the hotel.
[399:50.69]Right?
[399:50.89]The hotel's like a mile away.
[399:53.53]Go into the hotel.
[399:54.39]Go to the front desk.
[399:57.31]In the costume.
[399:58.41]I don't take it off yet.
[399:59.48]I get my room key.
[400:00.52]I wave.
[400:01.48]I nod.
[400:03.72]Go up to my room.
[400:05.16]Take off the outfit.
[400:07.98]Go to sleep.
[400:10.43]Satellite imagery.
[400:11.59]Check in in a fursuit.
[400:22.12]And then, okay, call up like a lift, be in the fursuit, get dropped off like five miles away from my house, and then walk the rest of the way to my house.
[400:36.81]And I'll just like take the whole suit off and put it in like a trash can.
[400:51.21]A limo's not stealthy.
[400:52.25]You'll attract more attention.
[400:58.24]It's just a giant stretch of that.
[400:59.38]People would probably be like, who's in that stretch limo?
[401:01.40]Why do you have to be in a limo?
[401:04.02]Because I need tinted windows.
[401:05.34]Oh, alright.
[401:19.60]I'll see you guys in a couple days.
[401:23.21]Hey Zeus, thanks for the 250, hey Zeus.
[401:24.95]Hey Jerm, good stream tonight.
[401:25.91]Shame about your viewbot software crashing.
[401:28.21]But what can you do?
[401:29.64]Oh my god.
[401:36.70]I'll see you guys in a couple days for VR.
[401:40.68]Take care, everybody.
[401:41.57]See you very soon.
[401:43.19]Have a great rest of your night.
[401:44.01]Have a great next couple days.
[401:46.55]Take care.
[401:51.44]Thank you.
[402:21.94]Thank you.
