[00:40.91]Tweet at Worms Revolution.
[00:43.05]And this Mini-Sentry is OP.
[00:46.39]We can't do it.
[00:48.46]Oh, great.
[00:48.94]I don't know.
[00:49.88]This is great.
[00:51.56]Oh, I'm like frozen.

[01:14.70]Oh, my God.
[01:15.80]I don't know what's going on here.
[01:17.54]You have to detonate it.
[01:19.14]I think you have to detonate that.
[01:21.29]Oh.
[01:24.13]Oh shit!
[01:26.48]Oh shit!
[01:27.44]Why did I tell him that?
[01:29.46]I should've left him in the dock.
[01:33.22]Alright, well I'm going to lose this match.
[01:37.68]Alright, we need two against Orbeez here.
[01:39.72]I'm sorry, Jerem.

[02:31.86]Sentries are banned from working pollution.
[02:33.68]Yeah, we're banning them from the circuit.

[02:49.84]I don't know what's going on here.
[02:53.86]Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[02:57.27]Oh, that's your way out.

[03:26.09]You just sat- I think it still- I think it still works.
[03:28.41]Look at it, it's moving.
[03:29.55]You sat my sentry.
[03:31.19]If that thing still works after eating a grenade, I'm gonna be pissed.
[03:35.82]Okay, seriously, I may... You're gonna have to, like, ninja rope up, like... It looks like a thermometer.
[03:44.62]A thermometer or a... Are you serious?
[03:53.45]I would've been so funny if you'd got it up there.
[03:56.37]Oh, that would've been... You would've seen me throw.
[04:00.45]More packages up there?
[04:01.43]Are you kidding me?
[04:02.89]He's loaded up there.

[05:34.86]Look at the terrain I have to work with here.
[05:36.64]I'm so screwed.
[05:39.47]I can't do anything.
[05:41.74]Susie, your faces of your worms are the best.
[05:44.76]Shibby.
[05:45.54]Thank you.
[05:46.04]Oh, how are you gonna do this?
[05:48.37]Uh... Grandpa.
[05:49.69]The camper.
[05:50.71]He has to go out of his- Yeah, ultimate camper.
[05:52.47]MLG Grandpa.
[05:53.63]I don't really know what all these things do.
[05:55.85]You have to have this parachute, right?
[05:58.23]Oh, Shibby, I would just drop a grenade down there.
[06:00.23]Lookit, he's got two dudes.
[06:01.65]Drop a cluster bomb on his ass.
[06:03.01]I just skipped.
[06:04.15]Is that a jump rope?
[06:05.05]Is that a sword?
[06:06.50]I just jump roped.
[06:08.38]Oh, God.
[06:09.42]Alright, I gotta think of something drastic here.
[06:12.56]You need to punch Orb into the water.
[06:17.28]Good luck.
[06:18.54]Alright, here we go.
[06:19.92]You're gonna miss.
[06:20.86]This is where we separate the men from the boys.
[06:23.62]Here we go, baby.
[06:24.63]The burger boys.
[06:26.51]Oh no, that's bad.
[06:28.89]Come on, knock him out!
[06:29.61]I thought it was gonna knock you into the water.
[06:34.89]Yeah, that was interesting.
[06:36.63]Oh, you open up the shibby down there.
[06:37.97]Now I can kill him.
[06:40.47]Oh shit, Shiba, you got two great spots right now.
[06:42.73]You're like in the top right and like in the top like bottom left.
[06:45.31]Yeah, but Orbs got the Mini-Sentry.
[06:46.79]I can't.
[06:48.03]Oh, that's right.
[06:52.19]Parachute, petrol bomb.
[06:55.31]Sheep.
[06:56.47]MLG Grandpa's in here.
[06:58.33]We only got three minutes on this game.
[07:00.61]I'm gonna camp you out.
[07:04.81]Oh, you're gonna make something happen.
[07:07.04]Oh jeez, they're diggin'.
[07:08.66]They're diggin'.
[07:09.90]I'm gonna reach you eventually, man.
[07:11.89]You're done.
[07:12.31]Yeah, the child limit needs to be extended, I think.
[07:16.65]We just need less worms, like four.
[07:19.19]Yeah, we'll do four next time.
[07:23.44]I think we can do less than that, no?
[07:25.20]Like three, maybe?
[07:26.22]We can do three.
[07:26.94]Three would be fun too.
[07:27.80]Jetpack, blowtorch.
[07:32.77]What is that?
[07:33.23]Is that a homing missile?
[07:34.25]Oh, is that a guided missile?
[07:35.87]Oh, you still have to shoot it, though.
[07:37.09]It's gonna hit you right in the face.
[07:39.14]Oh, no, it's not gonna work.
[07:40.30]That's gonna... yeah.
[07:43.36]That's their guided... Oh, you're done now.
[07:45.32]I have you now.
[07:46.72]Jerm, you gotta do me a solid and kill legit snipers.
[07:49.16]You are done.
[07:50.78]I'll try to do something.
[07:52.42]No way!
[07:53.18]Enough of these cluster bombs.
[07:54.24]You just need to bat him.
[07:56.15]Alright, let's go.
[07:56.71]We'll go with the dru- I gotta get up there first.
[07:59.01]Yeah, how are you gonna get up there?
[08:00.23]I can't even- I can't get up there.
[08:01.39]There's no room to get up there.
[08:03.09]Alright, fight.
[08:04.89]Hold on, here we go.
[08:05.99]Just a little toss, a little toss, a little toss.
[08:08.47]Oh, god!
[08:09.67]Oh, you're good.
[08:10.75]You're solid.
[08:11.87]You're going down in the water now.
[08:13.13]You're done.
[08:13.97]You're done.
[08:14.69]You're done.
[08:15.23]You're done, son.
[08:16.21]No.
[08:17.57]Crap-a.
[08:20.05]Pappa!
[08:20.94]Pappa!
[08:21.82]No!
[08:23.28]God damn it.
[08:24.20]Shibby's goddamn worm up there.
[08:26.24]Dude, Pappa's gonna ride this one out.
[08:27.72]You'll see.
[08:29.36]I will get to you eventually, Shibby.
[08:31.09]No.
[08:33.07]I will get to you.
[08:33.93]Nice nosk, brah.
[08:38.22]Oh no!
[08:39.74]Shit!
[08:40.18]Oh, that was a perfect shot.
[08:42.02]That aim though.
[08:42.90]Right through the shaft.
[08:44.40]How did you get that rush?
[08:45.80]I don't know how you did that.
[08:48.16]That is FPS aim right there fellas.
[08:51.48]Can I call upon like the power of the rats in the background to come like eat your face?
[08:54.62]No!
[08:55.58]Oh shit!
[08:56.24]That would be so funny if you fell down.
[08:58.46]Funny because you would have died.
[09:00.02]You probably really would have.
[09:01.10]It's been funny because you would have died.
[09:03.44]It sounds so horrible.
[09:04.64]Jump rope.
[09:05.65]Only a minute and 46 seconds.
[09:09.40]Aw, you.
[09:12.04]Aw.
[09:13.72]Aw.
[09:13.88]MLG grandpa doesn't care.
[09:16.23]Orb's going to win by default.
[09:18.27]Only a minute and 15 seconds left or so.
[09:20.47]You got to do more damage to him, Jerm.
[09:22.21]I can't.
[09:23.95]Oh, no.
[09:24.41]Oh, shit.
[09:24.68]No, that won't.
[09:25.06]You have to jump.
[09:26.96]Yes!
[09:27.66]Get in, get in, get in!
[09:29.08]Yes!
[09:30.78]Alright, here we go.
[09:32.72]We got a game.
[09:34.91]Well done, Jerome.
[09:36.23]Get out.
[09:38.07]Alright, Orb.
[09:39.45]We are never playing this again.
[09:41.07]I have done.
[09:43.39]30 seconds.
[09:44.79]Somebody has to do more damage to the other.
[09:46.87]Otherwise, this is over.
[09:48.45]Orb's gonna win.
[09:51.43]That's not gonna... That's gonna hit the side of the edge.
[09:56.90]Orb, you better hope he does not pull off some MLG grandpa craziness and wins the game right here.
[10:02.78]See what he does.
[10:03.99]from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from from
[10:34.29]I've seen the New England Patriots do some crazy stuff in the last minute of the fourth quarter.
[10:37.99]See if you can do it, too.
[10:39.43]How shall we take him out?
[10:42.57]You only got eight seconds.
[10:44.46]I don't know if this... I don't know what this will do, though.
[10:46.68]I don't know the time.
[10:47.56]What is this?
[10:48.12]What the fuck?
[10:53.37]You poked me!
[10:54.49]Chibi's gonna win the game right now!
[10:56.49]If I lose this, if I lose this because... I thought it would do some damage, I thought it would do some... Chibi, you gotta like jump ninja rope down there quick and do some crazy style.
[11:05.60]You better get down there, this is the game right here.
[11:07.50]Oh, if Chibi wins this, I will... Oh shit.
[11:09.16]What is he doing?
[11:09.92]He's parachuting!
[11:10.40]Holy shit!
[11:10.66]Oh my god.
[11:10.88]Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[11:22.67]Oh my god.
[11:24.09]Oh my god.
[11:27.24]What you got, Orb?
[11:28.12]Let's do this hand-to-hand combat.
[11:31.30]Oh, hell no.
[11:32.00]I'm not gonna project.
[11:36.28]Oh my god.
[11:37.55]Not this.
[11:38.35]Today, baby.
[11:39.69]You're in a choke.
[11:42.81]You're done.
[11:44.37]Goodbye.
[11:48.29]Lord No, you have time for one more thing Here we go.
[11:52.95]Here we go.
[11:53.99]Here we go.
[11:55.55]Oh my god What if we all die what if he kills us all it's a round draw man, oh No connection 17 seconds.
[12:09.84]You got 17 seconds to plan to try and make this happen.
[12:12.80]Oh
[12:13.88]Oh shit.
[12:14.88]You're stuck right there.
[12:15.90]Oh no, it's over.
[12:17.56]Oh shit.
[12:19.54]Oh no.
[12:22.42]Oh my god, what a joke.
[12:25.40]Stupid cluster bomb.
[12:27.66]Oh god, how should we end this?
[12:29.94]It's, uh, time's gonna run out.
[12:32.33]Is it?
[12:33.01]Mm-hmm.
[12:34.43]Two seconds.
[12:36.45]And you are the winner.
[12:37.89]That's disappointing.
[12:46.75]As time expires.
[12:48.99]As the time expires.
[12:50.98]Oh, well, well.
[12:53.32]Oh!
[12:54.12]Sudden death!
[12:55.18]Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, what?
[12:56.80]Why does he get to do this?
[12:58.30]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[12:59.88]If he... Seriously.
[13:01.34]He would probably make... Oh, the... Oh, never mind.
[13:04.60]You did the wrong... The cluster bomb would have probably made it... Dude, if you knock them both into the water, this is going to be the biggest comeback ever.
[13:10.04]Oh, my God.
[13:10.76]Is this...
[13:12.07]No, no, no.
[13:13.67]It's over.
[13:14.05]It's over.
[13:14.95]The Witcher sentry.
[13:16.05]Can it see me if I... I hope not.
[13:19.42]Oh, because the sudden death, it just raises the water level.
[13:22.26]I forgot that's what it does.
[13:23.36]Alright, so it keeps going.
[13:24.78]I didn't mess up that cluster bomb.
[13:26.84]Go, go, go, go, go.
[13:28.64]This is going to be it right here.
[13:30.31]Unless it screws it up.
[13:32.11]Hold on.
[13:32.61]I got this.
[13:34.69]I'm just going to...
[13:38.36]Oh, yes!
[13:39.24]Yes!
[13:39.86]Yes!
[13:40.72]Oh, you're so boned.
[13:46.03]Oh, you're so boned.

[13:49.73]Oh, no.
[13:50.61]Oh, no.
[13:51.87]Seriously.
[13:52.75]Seriously.
[13:53.71]No way.
[13:54.44]The game is glitched.
[13:55.38]Rick, tweet somebody.
[13:57.64]Tweet somebody.
[13:58.64]No way.
[14:01.30]No way.
[14:03.62]Where's my cursor?
[14:05.64]I cannot lose this.
[14:06.72]I cannot lose this.
[14:08.48]Where's my cursor?
[14:09.88]I'm waiting for players right now.
[14:11.90]I'm trying to select my move.
[14:14.36]Where's my move?
[14:17.64]Seriously, Chibi, come on.
[14:20.22]I think you're going to both bounce back into the water.
[14:21.90]It might not, though.
[14:22.76]The explosion's not that powerful.
[14:24.86]Oh, my God.
[14:25.54]GG!
[14:25.98]GG!
[14:26.52]Oh!

[14:41.22]The most epic comeback in Worms history.
