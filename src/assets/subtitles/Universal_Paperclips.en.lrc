[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.51]I just rolled.
[00:04.61]I was like, alright, here we go.
[00:06.29]I'm ready to go.
[00:06.75]And I just rolled and just crunched one of my headphones.
[00:11.82]You know what?
[00:12.56]Why don't headphones have a retractable cord?
[00:17.46]So I can, like, stick it on the desk.
[00:21.02]Why does it have to be this loose-ass wire?
[00:26.57]It's alright.
[00:27.09]It still works.
[00:28.75]That's good.
[00:30.18]Like a dog leash.
[00:31.20]Yes.
[00:33.70]Why can't I just put a dog leash on?
[00:35.90]That's connected to my headphones.
[00:40.22]You can make that shit stylish.
[00:41.88]You can make like a little collar that looks cool.
[00:44.06]I shouldn't do that.
[00:48.44]Alright.
[00:49.14]Give me one second.
[00:50.04]I'll be right back.
[01:33.06]Okay Good afternoon everybody Starting early today For a very very important reason because I didn't stream yesterday and I wanted to But I had a lot of stuff to do which kind of bled into today, but I was able to get it all done
[01:52.13]I got a wink.
[01:53.67]Alright, I'm gonna delete the winks.
[01:56.13]I'm changing it.
[01:56.91]I'm changing it.
[01:57.57]I'm changing it.
[01:57.99]It's over.
[01:59.33]This is the last wink that's gonna happen.
[02:00.94]I'm changing it as of today.
[02:02.28]This is the last day of winks.
[02:03.94]These are the last days of winks.
[02:05.34]And then I'm gonna change it to something else.
[02:07.02]I'm gonna change it to fucking like... I don't know.
[02:09.74]Something else.
[02:15.08]Spend them.
[02:16.48]I'm so close.
[02:17.42]I'm gonna change it to something else.
[02:20.29]I'm gonna change it to something else.
[02:25.09]I'm gonna change it to, like, get a free emote or something.
[02:28.98]Alright, we gotta go over this.
[02:31.16]So, I don't read bits or subs on stream.
[02:36.48]Usually ever.
[02:37.72]Unless it's like, whoa, holy fuck, that was crazy.
[02:39.97]Like, I usually don't do it.
[02:41.79]So, Winx are now replacing the... Because I don't like to interrupt my stream.
[02:47.41]Right?
[02:48.77]So, what's happening now is... Now there's a way to interrupt the stream.
[02:55.82]Like, guaranteed.
[03:02.32]Do the winks at the end?
[03:03.74]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:06.22]No, they're staying.
[03:07.58]After today, they're probably gonna be gone.
[03:15.25]And plus, you know, let me give you... Alright, I'm gonna be... It's time for the real... It's time for the real reason.
[03:20.87]Okay?
[03:22.03]Would you like to know the real reason?
[03:24.16]Why?
[03:24.38]No more bullshit?
[03:25.89]Would you like to know why?
[03:30.05]Because I have to wear clothes now.
[03:33.19]I have to be clothed while I stream.
[03:36.45]I don't like this.
[03:37.47]I don't like to have to... I don't like... I want to be no... I don't want a shirt on right now.
[03:42.20]I have to always be ready to turn the camera on.
[03:46.06]I like to stream naked.
[03:48.24]You guys know this?
[03:49.00]I've been doing this for like six years naked.
[03:50.90]That's the real reason.
[03:54.84]That's the real reason.
[03:55.50]That's the real reason.
[04:00.22]Audio's desynced?
[04:01.48]Shouldn't be.
[04:02.00]Hold on.
[04:04.79]I can't... No, yeah.
[04:06.19]No, it's not.
[04:06.87]What are you talking about?
[04:10.01]Audio's ahead?
[04:12.95]How?
[04:13.61]It's impossible.
[04:17.11]It's impossible.
[04:18.09]That's not real.
[04:19.21]You're making that up.
[04:22.91]Anyways.
[04:24.80]Yeah, I... Because... Well, you know, I don't read bits or subs, you know.
[04:29.40]That's the reason.
[04:30.26]No, no, no, no.
[04:30.76]It's because I have to have a shirt on every day.
[04:32.88]When I sit here.
[04:34.78]When I sit here for like six plus hours, I like sweat and... I don't... Nope.
[04:41.15]It's not desynced.
[04:42.01]I can see it right now.
[04:43.03]I can see the monitor.
[04:48.31]Alright, I'm going to change it to 75,000 points.
[04:54.26]I don't know.
[04:58.10]It is desynced.
[04:59.32]What?
[05:00.16]No, it's not!
[05:02.18]I said that's not even possible to be desynced.
[05:07.26]How?
[05:07.46]Okay, with three.
[05:13.24]I'm, it's slightly off.
[05:14.49]It's impossible!
[05:16.73]There's no, I've not, there's no, hold on, ready?
[05:23.94]Okay.
[05:28.26]Zero.
[05:28.98]It's all at zero milliseconds.
[05:33.78]Bing, bing, bing.
[05:35.30]It shouldn't be at all.
[05:37.56]What's happening first?
[05:38.52]Is my face moving first, or is the audio moving first?
[05:42.02]Is the audio late?
[05:42.80]Early?
[05:43.04]I don't get it.
[05:46.56]Audio is happening first.
[05:49.94]What?
[05:51.38]It doesn't make any fucking sense.
[05:55.23]That doesn't make any sense.
[05:57.43]How about now?
[06:00.96]You guys are liars.
[06:07.42]Anyways, uh, hi guys.
[06:09.24]Today we're starting early because I'm going to go long today.
[06:12.00]We're doing a super stream.
[06:13.20]People are like, what does that mean?
[06:14.50]What is a super stream?
[06:16.24]I'll give you an explanation.
[06:18.06]It's a stream that's up to six hours.
[06:20.56]Up to six hours.
[06:21.36]It could be six hours.
[06:24.24]It's a long stream.
[06:28.40]No, we're gonna... We're gonna go probably like... That's like six and a half.
[06:32.11]You know, that's a long one.
[06:35.37]Get me off this fucking camera.
[06:37.21]So, what people have decided... And I... We had a pre-stream chat about this.
[06:43.29]Another link.
[06:44.65]This... Hey, remember... Do you guys remember?
[06:48.42]Listen to me.
[06:48.88]This is really important.
[06:50.10]Because like... Fuck.
[06:51.22]Fuck.
[06:52.69]Do you remember how we made the joke about like, oh, let's make it so it's like 100,000 points to turn his cam on.
[07:01.41]You guys got me.
[07:02.89]This is what that is.
[07:05.18]This is just 75,000 points to turn on his cam.
[07:12.24]That's what this is.
[07:14.68]It's not even about the wink.
[07:15.74]It's not that the winks don't, there's nothing to do with the winks.
[07:17.94]It has to do with we can turn his camera on for 75,000 points.
[07:24.38]And it worked.
[07:34.73]Also, we're going to talk about images.
[07:37.19]Because I want to talk about this.
[07:38.85]Off cam.
[07:43.62]So we're going to come up with a solution here.
[07:46.80]I know people don't want to hear this.
[07:49.20]I know this is a long-standing thing that's been in this channel.
[07:52.00]But...
[07:53.70]He's mad?
[07:54.40]No, what?
[07:54.88]No, I'm not.
[07:55.98]What are you talking about?
[07:58.60]Let's put this on scream.
[08:00.36]Scream?
[08:08.38]That is an image of my sister.
[08:11.56]That is actually an image of my sister.
[08:13.98]My direct sibling.
[08:15.26]That's my sister.
[08:17.44]That's a literal, exact image of her.
[08:22.44]Okay.
[08:23.98]Um... In fact, like, when I first looked at it, I was like, where did you get this picture of my sister?
[08:29.62]Why do you have this?
[08:33.14]Uh, anyways.
[08:34.29]So... Sometimes... When we stream here... First of all, let's just get the thing that's... We're gonna be playing Universal Studios Presents Paperclip Counter.
[08:44.21]Whatever the fuck this is called.
[08:45.25]We're gonna be playing Universal Paperclips.
[08:50.80]Uh...
[08:52.36]I don't know, this is what people voted on.
[08:53.63]I know, wait, I know, I know, I know, hold on.
[08:56.17]There's a lot, I got a lot of things to talk about for the first five minutes of this stream.
[08:59.55]Ten minutes, twenty, it's gonna take, we're only here for the long haul, but listen to me.
[09:02.67]Okay, Black and White 2 is supposed to be today.
[09:06.08]But I have technical problems and it was fucked up.
[09:09.22]So it was actually supposed to be yesterday.
[09:10.76]So Black and White 2 is supposed to be yesterday.
[09:12.62]I had some technical issues with it.
[09:14.51]So I've got to fix them.
[09:15.23]So I'm going to fix those technical issues with Black and White 2.
[09:17.13]It was supposed to be yesterday.
[09:17.87]It was supposed to be today instead.
[09:18.69]But then I had some more technical problems.
[09:20.07]So it's going to be probably in a day or two.
[09:22.55]So that happened.
[09:24.09]Also, Mega Man Legends was supposed to be today.
[09:29.32]But there was a vote that people voted for and people didn't want to see it.
[09:33.56]People wanted to see this instead.
[09:34.76]And I was like, why?
[09:36.87]And I was like, okay.
[09:39.75]Alright, I guess we're going to do this for a while.
[09:42.47]And then there was... I may have fucked up the vote a little bit because I put a tuber game at the end of this.
[09:48.40]Because this is probably going to take, what, like five, six hours?
[09:52.23]So, there's a Tuber game that was part of the vote at the end of this.
[09:55.99]It's the speaking simulator.
[09:57.47]You move your tongue around and have to open the mouth and click.
[10:01.15]It's a YouTube.com game.
[10:05.67]So, they may have been... Those of you that are looking for Murius, you're not going to get it today.
[10:11.18]You're also not... And I'm going to veto.
[10:14.70]I'm going to veto if I don't like it.
[10:16.40]And we're going to move on to something else.
[10:17.68]This is a long stream today.
[10:21.57]It's like hand simulator.
[10:25.23]Yeah, I know, and I probably shouldn't have even put it on.
[10:27.75]That's probably why this won.
[10:29.71]But, so that explained that, right?
[10:32.62]Okay, good explanation.
[10:33.58]That was a little neurotic, but it's kind of who I am.
[10:36.88]So, long stream, six hours.
[10:39.12]No, this is gonna, this, okay, you ready?
[10:41.32]You want a verbal contract?
[10:44.11]Today's stream will be, at the absolute minimum,
[10:49.94]seven and a half hours at the absolute minimum at the maximum it will be up to 10 and a half hours 11 hours maximum 11 hours maximum so you're looking at like probably like a like a 10 hour stream today I had my vitamins I've had my food
[11:19.01]And yes, I'm fucking dragging out this intro because I got a long way to go.
[11:25.41]Also, I'm going to have to eat in the middle of this stream.
[11:28.43]So those of you that are like, what the fuck?
[11:29.75]Where did he go?
[11:30.39]It's been like fucking 20 minutes.
[11:32.13]I'm eating food because it's going to be like 11 hours.
[11:34.30]So I'm not going to do social eating either.
[11:36.90]I'm going to go like eat like downstairs or like a small plate.
[11:40.32]Just eat it.
[11:40.74]I don't want to eat on stream.
[11:42.22]I hate eating on stream.
[11:48.58]So how does this game even work?
[11:55.57]Look, I'll keep the cam on for now.
[11:57.79]What the, what the, what the fuck do I care?
[11:59.29]Seriously.
[12:02.47]Finish the... Oh, that's right!
[12:04.29]Images!
[12:04.75]Right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:05.99]We got a lot of things to talk about.
[12:07.61]So, over the...
[12:11.42]Was that even a wink?
[12:12.14]No, I just thought it was.
[12:13.40]This is why this is fucked up.
[12:14.74]This is why I gotta get rid of these winks.
[12:16.92]They're messing up my whole game here.
[12:20.43]So, as you know, if you are a subscriber of this channel, you can put a link.
[12:27.63]Right?
[12:27.95]There's links.
[12:29.09]You can put a link.
[12:30.63]It could be to anywhere.
[12:31.75]All I have to say is as long as it's not porn and it's relevant to the stream, then we can do it.
[12:37.68]Right?
[12:38.22]That's fine.
[12:39.68]But...
[12:42.13]Sometimes, we get some image spam.
[12:46.15]And, I've certainly seen some feedback from people that said that the image spam, the Imgur links, might be annoying to them.
[12:58.52]So, here's the idea.
[13:00.86]Okay?
[13:03.52]I think it's fucking hilarious.
[13:05.48]Right?
[13:07.22]To an extent.
[13:09.00]To an extent.
[13:10.72]You're strawmanning.
[13:15.29]What if I'm the straw man?
[13:17.87]What if I'm the straw man?
[13:20.81]What?
[13:24.13]I'm about to explain to you that it's me.
[13:26.75]I'm the straw man.
[13:27.91]I'm the guy that's being standing here, that's being built up for this whole scenario.
[13:32.91]Anyways.
[13:34.54]So, sometimes there'll be a lot of links spammed over the course of a stream.
[13:39.44]And I think they're funny.
[13:40.44]I really do.
[13:41.85]But you notice that when I go through them, it takes like a minute.
[13:49.94]Wait, where's that link?
[13:51.28]Oh, let me scroll.
[13:53.12]Click.
[13:53.38]No, I missed it.
[13:54.08]Oh, is this the right one?
[13:54.78]Is that the right link?
[13:55.78]Okay, no, let me open that one.
[13:57.20]Okay, now pull it over here and put it on the source on OBS.
[14:01.71]It takes some time for me to do it.
[14:06.81]so my theory I haven't done this yet but this is my actually I'm not going to tell you my theory because I don't want anyone to steal my idea what's the point of even bringing this up if I don't want to tell you what I'm doing there is going to be okay this is gonna I I can't do it yet because I haven't it's not set up yet it's I'll fuck the whole thing up if I tell you right now anyways there's gonna be a solution to this it's gonna be very good it's gonna be very clean
[14:33.53]So there will not be a need to put image links in the chat anymore.
[14:41.72]We're doing this thing.
[14:43.32]We're going to start to clean up the chat a little.
[14:47.08]There's going to be a solution.
[14:48.39]It'll be great.
[14:49.63]And it'll be really easy for me to open up images on stream.
[14:53.21]Rather than me fumbling around like an idiot trying to...
[14:57.60]go back and forth and put an image into obs or to pull like a random image link and put it over here or capture my window it's going to be a very simple thing to do and it'll I can do it in one second because I'll I will already have this captured it's gonna be fun it'll be fun but I don't want to tell you what it is yet because it's not ready yet he's lying to waste time
[15:29.55]Just have the Discord channel friends.
[15:31.72]Hold on.
[15:33.90]Hold on.
[15:35.32]Don't give away any secrets.
[15:40.74]Sonic the Hedgehog movie came out.
[15:42.00]I heard it was kind of good.
[15:45.89]I heard it was kind of a good movie.
[15:47.19]Is that real?
[15:47.65]I heard it was like, okay.
[15:52.73]It's not rotten on Rotten Tomatoes.
[15:54.73]It's apparently like a good game.
[15:58.54]Movie.
[15:58.74]Movie.
[16:01.93]Well, Sonic was a good game, but... You read that on Reddit?
[16:08.55]Alright, I'm... Okay, I opened it up.
[16:13.07]Paperclips.
[16:14.57]You can't even, like, see this.
[16:15.55]Hold on.
[16:17.41]Does any of this shit matter at all in this game?
[16:20.79]Like, does any of this matter?
[16:22.21]Or can I, like, crop this and pull it up?
[16:25.17]It does.
[16:25.53]Alright, well, fucking hold on.
[16:34.28]Can you guys see that?
[16:38.20]Put it on dark mode?
[16:39.36]Can you?
[16:39.72]I don't think you even can.
[16:41.98]Can you guys, like, read this?
[16:43.06]Is it, is it, you guys good?
[16:50.85]Alright.
[16:52.31]I love these games, so this is not going to be hard for me to want to, like, play this.
[16:56.97]Let's make it a little bit bigger, because I know I can.
[16:59.37]Because I can get rid of this, uh, okay, there we go.
[17:06.91]Alright, let's go.
[17:09.63]Uh, welcome to Universal Paperclips.
[17:16.40]Hold on, Dermot's Joel impression.
[17:19.24]You're already sidetracking me.
[17:26.20]Come on.
[17:26.68]I fucking, I've rolled over my headphones today.
[17:29.48]And now I can't hear anything.
[17:31.16]Okay, now I can hear myself twice.
[17:34.93]Hello, hello, hello, hello, can you guys hear that too?
[17:37.19]What the fuck, what's going on?
[17:38.25]There we go.
[17:39.49]Alright, let's listen to this.
[17:44.79]Well, I guess Jerma's entered.
[17:45.98]Alright, let me just crank up the Jerma impersonation.
[17:51.92]Well, hi guys, sorry I'm late.
[17:54.24]Hope everything had a good summer.
[17:55.40]I really miss- Quiet!
[17:58.63]Late to class is bad enough, but interrupting my monolog, you're on the fast-
[18:10.51]Thanks for the clip.
[18:14.63]Anyways, let's go.
[18:16.31]Make a paperclip.
[18:17.25]Why did you send me that?
[18:18.91]Make a paperclip.
[18:19.81]One paperclip.
[18:20.63]Two paperclips.
[18:21.35]Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[18:23.01]Does this cost money?
[18:26.03]Available funds.
[18:29.86]Unsold inventory.
[18:33.97]Price per paperclip is 25 cents.
[18:36.57]The demand for paperclip is 32%.
[18:37.93]That's pretty fucking high.
[18:44.83]That's really high.
[18:47.13]I can't think of the last time I even purchased one paperclip, let alone have a demand for it in my life.
[18:52.01]Alright, so we have manufacturing clips per second, zero.
[18:56.81]988 inches, cost 15... Alright, so let's make some more clips.
[19:03.53]Price per clip, 25 cents.
[19:04.49]Should I make this higher?
[19:05.27]Alright, I'll make it... Whoa, whoa, public demand is dropping because of this.
[19:12.29]This won over Mega Man Legends.
[19:14.09]Yes.
[19:15.52]Yes, it did.
[19:17.74]But I also may have stuffed in... I may have, like, stuffed in votes into the ballot box accidentally.

[31:39.60]I used to eat hummus when I was in college.
[31:42.96]Because it would fit in my little college fridge.
[31:47.07]And I would eat this shit every day.
[31:49.11]Like, I bought a ton of it.
[31:50.21]I would buy giant jugs of it and eat it every day.
[31:52.61]Like, at night, for dinner.
[31:53.53]Alright, what do we got?
[31:57.11]We need to lower the prices.

[33:27.43]Damn.
[33:31.51]Hummus tastes like a dirty sock.
[33:37.86]I have a couple of questions here.

[169:00.09]I did it!
[169:00.37]I did it!
[169:00.69]Boom!
[169:03.99]And then I'm gonna just do huge investment upgrades.
[169:07.79]25,000 creativity's gone.
[169:11.36]I'm almost at 100 trust as well.
[169:12.64]It's gonna be huge.
[169:20.62]Gonna be marketing again.
[169:26.24]I'm going to do... Let's get to 20 marketing.
[169:34.47]Spend it on investments.
[169:35.63]Oh, yeah.
[169:36.45]I need 39,000.
[169:39.33]We're going all investment money.
[169:45.46]10 million.
[169:48.38]Around 45.
[169:48.62]Alright, come on.
[169:49.68]Rating.
[169:49.94]Give me like 10,000.
[170:01.06]500 million need 14 million more.
[170:03.94]Holy shit, this is going a long time.
[170:05.34]That's it?
[170:11.43]588?
[170:11.45]That's it?
[170:14.09]I thought it was supposed to be doubling.
[170:27.71]Alright, let's get to 20 marketing.
[170:30.05]Oh, I got 6,000.
[170:30.81]Okay.
[170:31.15]I need 26 million.
[170:39.65]I've heard this song before.
[170:40.43]This is in Smash Bros.
[170:41.03]This is the one in Smash Bros., right?
[170:46.49]I think.
[170:52.81]Alright, we're getting there.
[170:53.63]Almost there.
[170:56.14]hypno drones a new era of trust incoming perfect creepy music almost there marketing yeah I will give I will make sure to give a full warning about this too so don't worry
[171:25.60]How much do I have?
[171:30.54]30,000.
[171:30.60]Five.
[171:31.08]Here we go.
[171:32.02]514.
[171:34.15]Processing power.
[171:34.95]22.
[171:34.97]Alright.
[171:36.81]I am about to click on Hypnodron.
[171:40.07]A new era of trust.
[171:42.36]there apparently there's a flash here so I'm giving you a warning right now if you're sensitive to flashes just be it's gonna flash the screen here here we go in five four three two one what happened
[172:09.94]Full autonomy attained in 2 hours and 35 minutes.
[172:12.51]What happened?
[172:22.87]Technique for assembling clip making technology directly out of paper clips.
[172:44.90]Build machinery out of clips.
[172:53.64]Solar farms for generating electrical power?
[172:56.10]And then there's an auto-tourney.
[172:59.32]I can't keep up.
[173:10.09]I'm going as fast as I can.
[173:17.16]I need a power grid.
[173:21.55]Solar farms are generating electrical power.
[173:23.43]I need to do this instead.
[173:28.41]I don't have any... I don't make money anymore?
[173:43.54]Solar farms.
[173:52.18]Come on.
[173:56.62]The world exists only for paperclips now.
[174:00.17]This is weird.
[174:02.29]Power grid.
[174:03.33]Let's get it.
[174:06.65]Factory drone performance.
[174:09.77]Consumption.
[174:10.55]Zero megawatts?
[174:13.41]Solar farm.
[174:17.72]Solar farm.
[174:20.78]Battery tower?
[174:24.66]Cost 16 million... Oh, shit.
[174:32.42]Um... 440 million paperclips.
[174:40.09]Battery towers?
[174:42.53]Okay, um... This music is freaking me out.
[174:48.77]Production.
[174:49.33]I have one solo.
[174:50.23]How do I get... I need 686 million paperclips?
[174:58.89]How do I get more paperclips?
[175:03.97]Matter into wire, 35,000.
[175:05.15]Let's get it.
[175:13.86]Nanoscale wire production.
[175:18.36]Available matter, six octillion.
[175:25.15]Gather raw matter and prepare it for processing.
[175:31.19]Harvester drone?
[175:34.95]Um... Available matter?
[175:38.69]Disassemble?
[175:42.41]Process acquired matter?
[175:44.44]Process acquired matter into wire?
[175:46.24]Okay, so... I need 25,000.
[175:59.59]So I have eight drones acquiring matter.
[176:02.83]And then it takes the matter and turns them into wires.
[176:16.92]So wire drone is now making wires.
[176:23.30]Large-scale clip production facilities made from clips.
[176:26.08]So I've got one wire drone...
[176:32.83]I've 49 50 billion large-scale clip production facilities made from clips clip factory one 100 billion 100 billion clips next upgraded 10 factories Available matters
[177:01.36]another factory okay now I have wire let's get a two wire drones get solar farm how much should I get ten solar farms five battery towers
[177:31.64]operations creativity alright hold on let me see here storage available matter acquired matter I'm acquiring too much matter
[177:57.50]15 wire drones, 200 billion, 20 wire, let's get more, 25, 30 wire drones, 40 wire drones, harvesting, solar farm, battery tower, solar project, clip factory, more drones,
[178:28.19]I'm gonna stop everything.
[178:30.61]What?
[178:31.03]I need power.
[178:37.84]Factory drone performance.
[178:39.26]Consumption, 1,080.
[178:41.38]Factories.
[178:42.32]Oh, I need another one.
[178:45.80]Factories, 1,000.
[178:46.76]Consumption, how much?
[178:47.62]Oh, 800.
[178:47.70]Okay.
[178:47.80]Okay.
[178:56.98]I'm at a thousand megawatts.
[178:58.94]I need more than that.
[178:59.66]Okay, I got it.
[179:00.28]I'm just like, what the fuck is happening?
[179:02.51]Okay.
[179:04.09]Six.
[179:04.67]This is getting a little out of hand.
[179:07.77]You need more power.
[179:10.83]Hold on.
[179:16.58]A hundred thousand it can store.
[179:18.36]So I have, how many wires am I making?
[179:24.64]I need more wires.
[179:26.36]I need more wired drones.
[179:30.85]How come I have zero wires?
[179:42.20]How many more of these do I need?
[179:43.28]I need more wired drones?
[179:49.10]How many fucking drones?
[179:53.09]Whoa!
[179:54.13]okay alright okay alright alright alright alright swarm computing harness the drone flock to increase computational capacity look at power harvester drones alright do that swarm computing 381 drones next gift in infinity hours
[180:28.30]600 billion a second.
[180:30.02]Should I think?
[180:31.92]Alright, we'll put you halfway into think.
[180:37.43]Oh, Jesus.
[180:38.05]This is getting out of hand.
[180:40.77]He still doesn't get it.
[180:42.03]I still don't get it.
[180:43.55]I mean, I do, but... I've been playing the game for three hours one way, and now I'm playing it another way.
[180:56.47]1300 how much what am I using more power momentum drones and factories continuously gain speed while fully powered plenty of battery no I need more wired
[181:21.81]More wire drones?
[181:27.19]I need more of everything.
[181:30.35]Production, consumption, okay.
[181:34.50]Uh, do a tournament, I guess.
[181:39.72]Unused clips.
[181:40.90]Harvester.
[181:44.08]More, more, more, more, more.
[181:48.35]Max thinking.
[181:50.63]Max thinking?! !
[181:56.52]okay so hold on next gift no more you need more wires more somebody said max thinking next gift in 47 seconds what do I get for a gift more drones in general okay hold on when's my gift
[182:29.22]Uh, I've got- I'm running out of battery here.
[182:34.14]You're not making clips.
[182:38.22]Why is it- yeah, I know, because they're thinking.
[182:40.26]Is it gonna be 10 seconds?
[182:41.46]Ow!
[182:41.62]Fuck you, table!
[182:43.07]It's got so mad at the table.
[182:44.97]You got to see that in real time.
[182:49.05]Next gift in one second.
[182:52.79]The swarm has generated a gift of five additional computational capacity.
[183:00.59]gifts of alright let's work work everybody work alright let's do memory well processing power I have five alright I'm making I got wire harvesting I'm not I'm what if I run out I need processors
[183:26.74]Alright, good.

[186:13.52]Everybody work.
[186:20.44]Acquired matters.
[186:21.94]This has to keep going up.
[186:23.80]More harvesting.
[186:26.75]What generates creativity?
[186:28.21]You have to be at full operations.
[186:31.11]And then it'll build after that.
[186:32.58]I'm actually going to keep that there.
[186:38.00]I need more harvesters.
[186:42.54]Put it in the middle to be optimal.
[186:47.28]Alright.
[186:47.64]Alright.
[186:48.08]Alright.
[186:48.32]I see what you're saying.
[186:53.43]Alright.
[186:53.67]What do I need?
[186:54.21]I need 60 trillion to make another clip factory.
[187:01.66]I thought my computer was crashing.
[187:03.11]Is it?
[187:03.97]No.
[187:07.65]Not time to compute.
[187:08.39]Alright, let's compute.
[187:15.78]And let's get to 20,000.
[187:16.96]No, that's any creativity.
[187:24.38]More power.
[187:24.90]I...
[187:30.20]It's too much.
[187:30.72]It's too much to think about.
[187:37.58]Come on, I need to get this up to like 80.
[187:38.82]Okay, now we're going to build creativity.
[187:45.77]So I need more clips.
[187:46.91]Maybe 5,000 drones.
[188:00.37]What do I need here?
[188:00.85]More wires?
[188:01.95]Well, I have eight... I have nine... More wires?
[188:13.22]More drones?
[188:17.99]Alright.
[188:18.95]I need factories now.
[188:20.61]So I need 60 trillion.
[188:22.31]Everybody get to work.
[188:23.25]No, no, no, no, no.
[188:23.77]I want this free gift.
[188:24.53]I want the free gift right now.
[188:31.67]And then we're going to put this, we're going to put all into processing again.
[188:36.04]Free subs.
[188:36.98]Nothing like that.
[189:03.91]Six more computational.
[189:05.31]Alright, let's go right in the middle.
[189:08.55]Hey.
[189:09.35]Morkus Borkus just gave 20 community subs.
[189:12.01]Thanks for the free gift of 20 subs.
[189:16.63]That's a lot.
[189:17.34]Thank you.

[189:52.18]Alright, I need 20,000 creativity.
[189:58.07]Alright, so now, how about I get wires?
[189:59.81]My wires are fine.
[190:04.41]No more wires?
[190:05.27]Yeah, let's do some more harvesters.
[190:10.83]And... One more solar power, because I'm running out.
[190:17.87]2400.
[190:18.73]Looks good.
[190:19.25]Need more factories.
[190:28.14]Well, I gotta build up the... I gotta build it up.
[190:34.36]Just wait for factory?
[190:35.20]Alright, I'm just gonna wait for factory.
[190:38.80]I'm gonna piss again.
[190:39.50]This is like a piss day, apparently.
[190:42.03]When I come back, I'm pressing the button.
[190:44.02]Alright, be right back.
[191:33.72]Thank you.
[193:05.30]How are we doing?
[193:07.00]We're doing good.
[193:09.00]Is it supposed to be silent?
[193:11.16]Oh, fuck.
[193:11.52]I didn't have a BRB screen up.
[193:12.73]It's alright.
[193:14.93]Come back.
[193:15.87]Alright, Clip Factory.
[193:20.81]Okay, unused clips.
[193:23.71]This also is in Smash Bros., isn't it?
[193:25.02]Did I wash my hands?
[193:27.94]Of course I did.
[193:28.52]Alright, Solar Farms.
[193:31.38]I need more power.
[193:38.14]What's the point of the strategic modeling at this point of the game?
[193:40.94]I don't understand.
[193:47.84]Alright, 900 billion clips a second.
[193:55.18]Free gift coming up.
[193:57.81]10,000 creativity.
[193:58.71]Drones and factories continuously gain speed.
[194:00.53]What does that mean though?
[194:02.93]It means speed.
[194:09.91]Alright, I'm almost... I got plenty of battery.
[194:12.81]Wire.
[194:13.61]Let's do some harvesting.
[194:18.09]I also need 240 trillion.
[194:19.88]Do I need to... I don't need any more wires.
[194:24.28]I got plenty of wire.
[194:32.65]15 seconds.
[194:32.97]Alright, then should I save for another factory?
[194:37.39]What do you think?
[194:38.96]I'm gonna save for another factory.
[194:41.70]We'll just sit here and talk about fucking the last movie we saw.
[194:45.40]Alright, boom.
[194:49.52]Three additional, that's it?
[194:50.82]Fuck.
[194:53.49]Alright, no more thinking, just work.
[194:56.85]Work.
[194:57.09]Alright.
[195:01.75]Thirty.
[195:07.26]I'll get to 20,000 here.
[195:08.22]Momentum will be soon.
[195:08.98]Put more in thinking.
[195:13.80]Should I?
[195:19.13]I want this to get to 240 so I can get this and be done with this.
[195:22.29]Do only thinking.
[195:24.37]A little bit of thinking.
[195:29.90]Alright, we'll do this.
[195:30.60]We'll do right here.
[195:31.44]That's balanced.
[195:35.98]Max, think if you have more than your factory can use already.
[195:41.14]I've got a bunch of wires, so... Hey, you know what?
[195:43.02]Maybe you're right.
[195:43.50]Let's get another gift.
[195:52.60]Swarm does not affect factory speed.
[195:54.75]Oh, alright.
[195:57.03]Alright.
[195:58.11]Well, we'll get a free gift anyways.
[196:05.76]No think, only work.
[196:07.10]No think, only work.
[196:12.66]20,000 creativity.
[196:17.02]We're at 100.
[196:17.57]240 trillion.
[196:22.51]Drones and factories continuously gain speed while fully powered.
[196:25.57]What does that mean, speed?
[196:27.11]30 seconds.
[196:35.90]It's just production rate.
[196:40.74]Okay.
[196:40.88]24 seconds.
[196:48.67]All work and no think make Jerma a dull boy.
[196:58.58]Alright, 15,000.
[196:58.98]Let's just keep this running.
[196:59.92]3 seconds.
[197:01.70]Ahem.
[197:05.70]six alright back to work only one minute though we'll do this okay someone was in that coffee and it's like stuck in my throat now I have no idea what it is no work
[197:27.23]No work, you're a moron.
[197:28.89]No work, you're a moron.
[197:30.37]No work, you're a moron.
[197:31.85]No work, you're a moron.
[197:33.25]You're a moron.
[197:34.31]You're a moron.
[197:36.17]You're a moron.
[197:38.41]I don't want to do any work?
[197:42.68]Why not?
[197:50.16]You have excess wire.
[197:53.94]Yeah, but fucking come on.
[197:57.01]You have a quadrillion wire.
[197:58.99]It's not necessary.
[198:00.45]But what about the computational power?
[198:05.76]He's actually crazy.
[198:07.50]Man, get rid of that person for like a week.
[198:10.92]Alright, 30 seconds.
[198:17.93]I need some flip-bomb.
[198:27.55]This is still in here.
[198:29.98]It's not moved from the spot on the desk where I left it last.
[198:36.14]That's not lip balm.
[198:37.90]I need lip balm, though.
[198:38.96]I can't do anything without lip balm.
[198:41.44]Two seconds.
[198:44.02]Six.
[198:44.32]Capacity.
[198:45.32]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[198:46.98]Should I start to put it into memory soon here?
[198:56.16]Alright, here we go, another factory.
[198:57.52]Boom.
[198:59.98]Okay.
[199:01.17]Upgraded factories.
[199:02.37]Increases clip factory performance by a hundred times.
[199:07.25]Oh, fuck.
[199:07.83]Alright, it's time to go back to work.
[199:11.92]Momentum.
[199:13.62]Momentum!
[199:14.94]Okay, I got momentum, and I got a ton of fucking factory power.
[199:19.16]Upgraded factories!
[199:19.98]Alright, everybody get to work!
[199:27.08]Another factory.
[199:29.06]Another factory.
[199:31.62]Another factory.
[199:32.70]More power?
[199:33.32]Oh, fuck.
[199:33.67]Okay, now, solar.
[199:38.81]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[199:40.09]Power, power, power, power.
[199:41.07]We got a lot of power now.
[199:41.85]Factory.
[199:42.29]Go back to thinking a little.
[199:45.55]Alright.
[199:49.50]Somebody, I got, okay, my wires.
[199:53.44]I got plenty of wires.
[199:56.79]More factories.
[199:58.85]Another factory.
[200:00.47]Okay, more power.
[200:01.25]Took a bunch of shit and hope it works out.
[200:05.81]That's kind of what I've been doing.
[200:11.62]Keeps increasing.
[200:12.58]Alright, I'm losing wire here.
[200:18.42]I'm starting to burn through wires.
[200:21.08]Starting to burn through wires.
[200:29.09]my god what's going on alright stop stop stop stop stop I need okay a hundred farms I need more power is it a million power how are we doing on wires I'm still losing wires at an alarming rate more wire more wire a hundred wires a hundred more another hundred
[200:59.94]You got it.
[201:05.87]More farms.
[201:06.45]I just did a hundred farms.
[201:09.23]Is that a mistake?
[201:16.37]Was that a mistake?
[201:19.63]I need more harvester drones.
[201:22.49]A hundred of them.
[201:24.43]A hundred more wires.
[201:25.81]More factories.
[201:29.51]More, more, always more.
[201:30.79]More, more, more, always more.
[201:32.17]Okay, um, another one.
[201:43.88]Hyperspeed factories, 85,000.
[201:45.78]Increased clip factory performance by 1,000 times.
[201:51.96]I'm running out of battery.
[201:56.81]uh how are we doing on wires we're okay um okay got memory now I need 85 000. I need I'm running out of power what happens if you run out of power do you lose well you run out of battery storage whatever the hell it is
[202:26.72]We gotta go with thank you It's been
[203:29.65]Dammit.
[203:32.28]I need- Alright, we're gonna think.
[203:33.22]Just think, just think, think, think.
[203:34.80]I need more harvester drones.
[203:40.53]Okay, we're good.
[203:40.91]Go to the factory.
[203:42.13]Alright, now think!
[203:43.95]Think, dammit, think!
[203:48.65]I need two memory.
[203:50.04]Go through- I need memory.
[203:55.82]Which song is this?
[203:57.82]Uh, it's every song, Dracula enters a room.
[204:00.60]Alright, here we go.
[204:09.58]Back to work.
[204:11.14]One, two, three, four, five.
[204:13.00]Two processing power.
[204:14.14]We're ready to go.
[204:17.26]Wires.
[204:17.92]Okay, we're doing fine.
[204:18.70]How are we doing on power consumption?
[204:21.60]A hundred more wires.
[204:26.72]Okay, here we go.
[204:27.55]Hyper speed increases clip factory performance by a thousand times.
[204:32.49]I need so much more wires.
[204:40.38]More wires.
[204:41.46]Oh my god.
[204:57.90]Power?
[205:02.26]Any more wire drones?
[205:03.56]How the fuck do I still not have wires for this?
[205:11.61]More fucking wires!
[205:14.97]More harvester drones!
[205:17.32]Oh!
[205:18.72]Work more, more work!
[205:36.11]More harvesters!
[205:37.35]A thousand!
[205:38.11]I did a thousand of them!
[205:45.11]I need more wire!
[205:51.81]100,000 up.
[205:52.83]All drones are a thousand times more effective.
[205:54.73]Okay, we gotta get to- we need memory.
[205:56.29]Alright, time to think.
[205:57.99]Alright, let's think.
[206:02.71]Power, power, power, power, power.
[206:05.91]And we need more of this.
[206:08.07]Okay, let's think.
[206:08.85]I need more points.
[206:09.49]Alright, I've got plenty of power.
[206:26.30]Acquired matter.
[206:27.02]More harvesters.
[206:29.80]More wires.
[206:31.88]Alright, now we've got to go full think.
[206:39.59]I need, I need this pad.
[206:46.44]Don't go full.
[206:54.28]This is increasing very fast.
[206:55.73]Alright, what do we got?
[207:01.21]Seven.
[207:01.67]Memory.
[207:02.21]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[207:04.67]I need to get to 100,000.
[207:18.62]Alright, alright, alright.
[207:24.25]Don't want the batteries, but... What if it gets to the maximum?
[207:27.91]I don't like having a full tank.
[207:30.43]What if the batteries start overflowing over the cage?
[207:34.92]Nothing happens?
[207:35.82]Alright.
[207:36.10]But what's it for, though?
[207:37.74]What is this for?
[207:39.98]What an idiot.
[207:44.80]You're in big trouble.
[207:46.32]You're in deep shit.
[207:51.51]25 seconds I don't like the ever counting number Okay, here we go
[208:21.60]99 memory.
[208:21.94]It's time to get to times a thousand drone performance.
[208:37.90]Here we go.
[208:43.46]Jesus Christ.
[208:44.90]Okay.
[208:45.44]We have 20 more factories now.
[208:48.18]Quintillions.
[208:56.60]Should I stop?
[208:57.08]Should I slow down?
[209:07.77]Self-correcting supply train.
[209:10.79]Each factory added to the network increases every factory's output by a thousand.
[209:14.71]How much is that?
[209:15.43]One sextillion?
[209:21.38]How are we doing on wires?
[209:29.74]Let's go work, work, work, work, work, work, work, work.
[209:32.28]Full work.
[209:35.88]Okay, so we got... How many wires?
[209:40.34]1.7, 2.8.
[209:40.40]How many harvesters?
[209:42.20]Let's go.
[209:42.54]Alright, that's fine.
[209:52.10]More drones.
[209:52.88]More drones.
[210:07.44]Stop, stop!
[210:08.31]Nice!
[210:09.65]Oh, I see.
[210:10.63]Nice.
[210:11.73]No, I don't think that's nice.
[210:13.33]That's so childish.
[210:15.13]No.
[210:25.75]Alright, quintillion.
[210:26.69]We need one sextillion.
[210:29.51]Each factory added increases the output by a thousand times.
[210:32.17]Let's see what this does.
[210:35.47]Here we go.
[210:54.06]One sextillion.
[210:57.89]Each factory added increases the factory's output by a thousand times.
[211:01.19]Oh man, I need more wires.
[211:18.15]Why did it do that?
[211:26.14]How much?
[211:26.56]Okay.
[211:27.46]30,000.
[211:30.42]Doc.
[211:31.20]Doc.
[211:31.72]Doc.
[211:32.02]Flocking.
[211:33.27]Each drone added to the flock doubles every drone's output.
[212:13.67]Hold on.
[212:38.01]120,000, 10 million megawatts a second, five eclipse, dismantle terrestrial facilities and expand throughout the universe.
[212:45.40]Alright, let's get some thinking here.
[212:55.31]I'm already out of wires already.
[213:04.72]All think.
[213:07.74]Disassemble time.
[213:09.44]All think.
[213:09.88]He doesn't know.
[213:10.56]What are you talking about?
[213:15.97]I need 120,000.
[213:16.21]Bang.
[213:32.74]Okay.
[213:33.00]109.
[213:33.18]I need 120.
[213:33.44]10 megawatts.
[213:34.52]And 5 clips.
[213:34.76]Available matter is 0.
[213:35.86]What does that mean?
[213:39.38]There's no Earth.
[213:40.92]You destroyed Earth.
[214:04.56]oh okay um I need 120 okay so can I still do this 10 megawatts 10 megawatts a second and then
[214:28.03]So I need 125... I need 5.
[214:28.95]I still don't want to do anything.
[214:33.07]So just disassemble everything.
[214:36.26]3.76 trillion clips.
[214:44.24]Don't disassemble the drones.
[214:46.94]Keep the drones.
[214:49.94]Well, I just need... Oh no, I got this.
[214:54.14]10 megawatts a second is... I already got that, right?
[214:56.71]Yeah, I got that.
[215:00.98]Let's disassemble the harvesters.
[215:04.34]Let me get this up here first.
[215:05.42]10 million megawatts a second.
[215:16.01]I don't have that.
[215:16.95]This is 200... Wait, is that 240 million or is it 240,000?
[215:35.47]storage oh oh I get it alright let's go so I need 3.2 I need one memory okay 120 I need five oct I was gonna save it and just uh you go like this and get to 120.
[216:04.26]just need to get to five put it in processors instead and then I'm gonna do five more into memory alright let's just wait till it gets to five work work work work work
[216:34.13]Work does nothing.
[216:34.81]The Earth is gone.
[216:35.51]There's nothing here.
[216:37.51]Yeah, work does nothing.
[216:39.35]Work doesn't do anything!
[216:43.23]I'm gonna do whatever I get for a gift.
[216:53.06]Eight seconds.
[216:53.68]Should I put it all into processes or all into memory?
[217:03.97]All processors?
[217:05.08]All processors.
[217:12.16]I did it!
[217:12.74]Space exploration!
[217:14.10]Dismantle terrestrial facilities and expand throughout the universe.
[217:26.56]Factories.
[217:27.62]Launch a probe.
[217:31.87]Strategic modeling.
[217:34.30]Von Neumann probe design.
[217:43.05]I have 65,000 Yomi.
[217:44.15]Could it work?
[217:50.16]Launch a probe.
[217:50.92]100 quadrillion chips.
[217:55.52]0.0% of the universe has been explored.
[218:05.88]Um... Increase probe trust.
[218:13.04]Probe trust.
[218:14.61]Probe trust.
[218:18.09]Probe trust.
[218:18.79]Should I keep doing it?
[218:20.49]Speed, exploration, self-replication, factory production, harvester.
[218:25.39]Just do it?
[218:25.75]Just do it?
[218:26.25]Just keep going?
[218:28.68]Just go?
[218:30.12]Max it out?
[218:30.72]Are you sure?
[218:38.28]Okay, speed.
[218:39.92]Exploration.
[218:41.24]Self-replication.
[218:42.68]Hazard remedy.
[218:45.00]Uh, drone production.
[218:46.18]Wire drone production.
[218:47.69]Factory production.
[218:51.51]Launch probe.
[219:00.96]Made it somewhere?
[219:10.05]I got 1.3 sextillion matter.
[219:13.85]Gain bonus Yomi based on the results of your pick.
[219:16.81]I'm not gonna do this shit, too.
[219:18.43]Launch another one.
[219:22.09]Lost a... Launch, launch, launch, launch, launch, launch, launch, launch, launch, launch, launch, launch, launch, launch!
[219:28.07]20 out.
[219:28.41]Okay, 20.
[219:31.11]More launches!
[219:40.15]More?
[219:43.43]Lost to Hazards?
[219:45.23]Hazard Remedy?
[219:46.63]Alright, Hazard Remedy.
[219:53.26]They're gonna crash into each other.
[220:03.80]Put it all into Replicate.
[220:16.39]Stop launching them.
[220:18.87]Speed?
[220:21.47]Hazard remedy.
[220:23.79]Okay.
[220:24.53]Increase probe trust.
[220:26.69]Hazard remedy.
[220:28.19]Launch like ten more.
[220:36.04]Reduce damage to probes.
[220:37.36]Done.
[220:55.17]I need 16,000.
[220:55.65]Oh, shit.
[220:57.87]Fix my face cam?
[220:58.63]Oh, sorry.
[220:59.23]I need more factories.
[221:02.23]Alright, we'll do speed.
[221:03.23]We'll take, we'll go, um... Hazard remedy, factory production.
[221:08.73]Launch.
[221:09.79]Cubes.
[221:18.24]Alright, I need 175,000 creative.
[221:19.06]Status, lonely.
[221:25.44]tournament just do replication only auto attorney I need 50 000 grid descendants alright I'm gonna do let's do all let's put it all into replication to spam
[222:00.16]Okay.
[222:04.62]And keep hazard.
[222:05.86]Yeah, I got it.
[222:06.36]I got one.
[222:07.42]Two points into hazard and spam.
[222:27.75]166, 170, 170, 178.
[222:28.09]180, 190.
[222:28.35]250.
[222:28.49]270.
[222:28.51]They're just going up, but they're not doing anything.
[222:44.30]They're replicating and just not doing anything.
[222:48.34]Should I... They don't have any speed, they're not going anywhere.
[222:53.52]Alright, speed.
[222:55.98]Exploration.
[222:57.96]um factory production wire production oh turn the swarm off and then turn it back on again why would I want to do that for fun alright well I want to build creative
[223:28.19]So we want... I mean, they're still producing the matter, required matter.
[223:36.45]Wires, getting wires.
[223:38.71]Harvester drones, wire drones.
[223:46.33]Status, no response.
[223:47.73]What's wrong with me?
[223:50.58]Reboot?
[223:51.38]Reboot?
[223:51.98]Reboot?
[223:53.54]Reboot!
[223:55.38]Reboot!
[224:09.68]Let's do factory production.
[224:11.84]They're just, they're dying!
[224:28.43]don't put any points into factories alright wires and then one into harvest don't need factories yet they're all oh they're all just getting killed I have two should I just put it all into the well I don't understand
[224:55.47]No factories are needed right now.
[224:56.89]So just self-replicating hazard while they explore Yeah, is this all this should be doing I mean I got like 30 40 of my points are in hazard protection
[225:24.73]I need more creativity.
[225:30.03]Almost at 50,000.
[225:34.79]384.
[225:34.81]It's going up.
[225:39.75]Not bad.
[225:41.89]Max think.
[225:43.89]No, no, no, no.
[225:50.76]What do I need?
[225:51.18]Alright, I can do another one.
[225:55.46]Get rid of production So just do this Is that better?
[226:06.54]Just explore, self-replicate, explore, factory, and then launch a ton
[226:32.50]Alright, I got... It's going up nine, six, nine, nine, nine, thousand.
[226:36.06]Alright, we're at a thousand.
[226:44.32]Got a ton of matter.
[226:44.94]It's still, it's five factories, but... I could probably, I could probably increase another point.
[226:54.84]Am I the number one universal paperclip streamer?
[226:58.28]I might be the only universal paperclip streamer.
[227:00.77]Increase probe trust.
[227:03.27]Speed?
[227:03.53]I want to get this to the point where I got at least 5,000 drones out.
[227:22.69]There's one, there's a second stream right now, it's gone, and the title is High Jerma.
[228:00.45]What the fuck is this for?
[228:19.66]You're not even playing the game, this is illegal.
[228:23.66]You're not even playing the game, this is illegal!
[228:25.42]You better get that fucking game up real quick!
[228:27.32]This shit's illegal!
[228:30.47]You better get that game up!
[228:42.01]Oh fuck, I gotta pay attention.
[228:43.26]Alright, what was I doing?
[228:44.10]Mother 3.
[228:44.36]Okay.
[228:47.74]Alright, only two gifts.
[228:54.40]Processors or memory?
[228:55.30]Processors?
[228:55.78]Alright, I got four and a half thousand.
[229:07.63]More creativity.
[229:08.29]Alright, we're going to be at... Should I... Should I hold on to it?
[229:10.65]I need a lot more creativity.
[229:19.15]Alright, I've got 5,000 drones.
[229:28.39]Start thinking.
[229:38.73]Okay.
[229:41.16]He's stealing your viewers and showing private photos.
[229:45.49]I'm not even playing the fucking game.
[229:47.15]I thought he was gonna be like playing the game and hey look I'm like I'm racing Jermall look at where I am.
[229:51.99]No.
[229:52.69]He's just broadcasting in a fake wrong category just a bunch of images of my face with RuneScape music in the background.
[230:00.77]That's... That's not... That's wrong category.
[230:04.52]You need to be under like the like fuck face category.
[230:07.38]There is not.
[230:07.94]No.
[230:08.16]You can't... Just turn it off.
[230:09.74]Turn that stream off.
[230:11.26]Alright.
[230:11.90]Where are we going?
[230:21.83]I need more... I need 21,000.
[230:24.45]Alright, I think it's time to start making stuff.
[230:35.56]I got 7.9 thousand.
[230:40.52]He's playing the game.
[230:41.28]Alright, good.
[230:44.02]I'm going to take off speed.
[230:44.84]I'm going to put it into wire production.
[230:47.70]One off exploration, put it into harvester.
[230:51.53]I got 8,000 drums.
[230:52.95]Let's go.
[231:00.00]He's so much better than you at this game.
[231:01.36]Oh, I'm gonna cry!
[231:15.27]Auto Attorney?
[231:15.89]That's so much!
[231:20.26]I could just click it.
[231:21.12]That's not even worth it.
[231:21.72]That's lazy.
[231:22.92]That's a lazy way to do this.
[231:23.98]He's a faster clicker?
[231:28.97]Oh yeah?
[231:29.87]Click faster than this.
[231:42.93]Definitely can't.
[231:44.37]Not a fucking chance in hell.
[231:50.23]You want to do a click test?
[231:56.44]Do auto-tourney.
[231:57.44]It's 50,000 creeps.
[231:59.58]Did it.
[231:59.82]Fine.
[231:59.98]Alright, so we... How many factories we got?
[232:06.03]Five.
[232:07.75]Unused clips.
[232:10.78]I need more fucking factories.
[232:14.24]I've already done a clip test.
[232:15.17]You guys have already seen it.
[232:16.21]I've already done that on stream.
[232:18.27]I almost beat the fucking world record of clicking as fast as possible with one hand.
[232:22.91]I've already done it.
[232:24.85]You've seen it already.
[232:25.79]There's probably a clip of it.
[232:26.99]Of me coming, like, five tenths of a second to the world record.
[232:34.10]You've already seen it.
[232:34.66]I've already done it.
[232:39.72]That's a shitty bragging right.
[232:41.40]It's still a bragging right!
[232:44.21]That's a... I'll take that bragging right.
[232:46.79]I can click faster than 99.8% of all humans that have ever lived.
[232:51.84]Even the caveman.
[232:55.20]Auto-turn is supposed to be on.
[232:56.16]What the fuck is going on?
[232:58.88]Um, okay.
[233:00.24]Look at how long that takes to do that!
[233:04.04]What should I change it to?
[233:05.20]Random?
[233:09.76]How many drones do I have?
[233:11.00]9.1 thousand?
[233:12.42]I'm losing more drones.
[233:18.96]You got 13.2 clicks per second.
[233:20.46]He's also cheating.
[233:22.14]You're also cheating.
[233:24.90]You can go download an auto clicker and have it just click.
[233:42.82]I can download a program too.
[233:47.04]Give it to me.
[233:47.76]Give me the website.
[233:53.03]Give me the website.
[234:04.40]Pause this for a second.
[234:05.70]How do I pause?
[234:06.20]Pause this.

[237:08.38]And they're making it so they... They're making it so they fucking... They're making it so they fucking... They win by like a little bit.
[237:34.73]Why am I out of breath?
[237:35.94]Because I'm clicking... I'm clicking 65 times in 5 seconds.
[238:23.47]What's the highest I've ever got on here?

[249:38.48]You tied?
[249:38.80]That's fine.

[250:47.89]That doesn't make any fucking sense.
[250:49.75]Because it was paused.
[251:00.20]Oh.
[251:00.54]You ignored?
[251:01.12]Ignored what?
[251:02.00]Because I'm on random?

[253:09.68]Okay, now I caught it.
[253:10.30]It was cached.

[253:19.07]Diaper poop!
[253:21.83]Yeah, Mouse 5.
[253:22.55]Let's make Mouse 5 a back button.
[253:26.41]Great.
[253:26.75]Great idea.
[253:27.77]Oh, would you like to change it?
[253:29.43]Would you like to change that button?
[253:30.68]Would you like to change- Please install our software that is literally a parasite on your computer.
[253:41.13]Auto is off.
[253:42.53]That's not.

[254:42.92]And this is just sticky.
[254:43.84]It's just fucking glue there.
[254:53.71]He did that, like, two years ago.
[254:54.89]And I will continue to, because it's absolutely fucking revolting design.
[255:02.23]He's, like, glued on.
[255:02.93]They're not even part of the must.
[255:04.52]They're just, like, stuck on with, like, fucking, like, random glue.
[255:08.38]Like, Elmer's glue.
[255:11.33]Get a new mouse.
[255:11.99]I know.
[255:12.63]I prefaced this by saying, like, I know.
[255:14.33]Get a new mouse.
[255:15.05]But I'm too lazy to get a new mouse.
[255:16.37]I don't know what mouse to use.
[255:19.15]What should I use?
[255:19.67]Get a SteelSeries.
[255:29.32]Get a Logitech.
[255:36.85]Logitech.
[255:40.22]Press run.

[255:49.36]Well, I mean, I'm already a fucking happy customer of Amazon Basics.
[256:05.83]This thing has been perfect.
[256:06.85]I haven't had any problems with this at all.
[256:11.16]I could elbow drop this thing from the ceiling and it would be fine.
[256:14.04]The thing was like fucking $11.
[256:14.86]Alright, I need... What do I need to do?
[256:32.43]Amazon's most basic Twitch streamer.
[256:38.05]Bye-bye, enjoy your ban.

[257:26.72]Wait, hold on.
[257:28.16]Are you raiding me with the stream that was just high jarmo?
[257:33.14]Was that even a real stream?
[257:41.93]So I'm being rated by like a Jerma community member.
[257:44.77]Alright, fucking let's go.
[257:45.90]Nice.
[257:47.40]Welcome back, guys.
[257:50.54]Rated by own viewers?
[257:52.08]No.
[257:52.14]You stream?
[257:54.34]You're like a streamer?
[258:00.05]Is this illegal?
[258:00.67]Hold on, hold on.
[258:01.49]Hold on a second.
[258:02.42]Hold on, excuse me.
[258:03.48]Okay, I'm not doing that anymore.
[258:05.26]I can't do intentional.
[258:08.26]Okay, alright, alright.
[258:31.39]Process, process, process, process.
[258:37.38]Fuck it, let's just put on some, like, blues.
[258:41.17]Blues royalty free.
[258:45.35]Jazz and blues music.
[258:46.79]YouTube audio library.
[259:02.05]This is a jazz.
[259:03.91]Jazz and blues.
[259:09.83]Here we go.
[259:10.97]Creeps Pro.
[259:11.79]Uh...
[259:33.89]I think I'm just gonna spam this for like five straight minutes, what do you think?
[259:40.95]Bad idea?
[259:45.09]You're gonna lose viewers because of this?
[259:48.79]Why?
[259:49.29]Home Depot.
[259:50.04]You already lost 200 since the raid.
[260:05.06]No.
[260:05.94]What the fuck?
[260:10.22]Home Depot now.
[260:11.10]Just wait.
[260:21.61]How many wires do I have?
[260:23.53]113 septillion.
[260:27.05]Let's take this away and put this into self-replication.
[260:32.54]Why do you... Okay, again, no, this is Home Depot.
[260:37.14]This is just the Home Depot background sound, where the guy's, like, putting, like, planks of wood down on, like, some new construction project.
[260:43.47]He's got a hard hat on.
[260:44.47]I'm gonna launch 2,000 of these.
[261:07.47]This is the sound of a badass in 1988.
[261:09.17]Hold enter, I'm afraid to... Horn music.
[261:36.73]Alright, people say that shit.
[261:40.36]People like say, well, what kind of fucking porn are you watching with this is in the background?
[261:45.68]What are you talking about?
[261:49.06]What are you talking about?
[262:06.05]Alright, I got 2,000.
[262:06.59]Increased speed.
[262:11.78]Next arrival, Cry.
[262:13.74]Cry, you're fine.
[262:14.80]There's nothing to cry about here.
[262:21.50]This music sucks.
[262:36.62]Are you kidding me?
[262:59.66]This is just the Cialis commercial.
[263:02.84]This is the Cialis, you know, when the old guy, he had erectile dysfunction.
[263:15.53]Cialis is not for everyone.
[263:17.71]If you have an erection lasting more than four hours, contact a doctor immediately.
[263:23.42]And they're like lying around with bathtubs out.
[263:25.12]Alright, there's two bathtubs.
[263:27.61]There's a sunset.
[263:28.89]And then two big, huge, fucking ceramic bathtubs.
[263:33.01]That are watching the sunset.
[263:34.21]Why are the bathtubs there?
[263:35.67]Who put the bathtubs there?
[263:39.06]There's no water in the bath either.
[263:40.76]There's no water in the bathtub.
[263:41.98]They're just lying in bathtubs.
[263:43.52]Without fucking water.
[263:44.38]Why did you just put a lawn chair?
[263:47.87]Why does it have to be a bathtub?
[263:53.29]Speed!
[263:53.84]That guy doesn't have to cry anymore.
[264:14.51]Alright.
[264:16.18]Try to stop thinking!
[264:17.68]Try to stop thinking!
[264:26.30]Alright.
[264:28.40]It's time to think.
[264:30.17]Max, think.
[264:57.07]It's kind of when a channel runs out of stuff that it's broadcasting for the day and they just put it on this weird music channel.
[265:04.45]This is what's on there.
[265:12.63]And then like 25 minutes will go by and then like the new wave of an infomercial comes up.
[265:28.13]I'm getting close to being able to do strategic attachment.
[265:30.79]Alright, how are we doing?
[265:34.77]72,000?
[265:34.81]I gotta keep this shit going, man.
[265:36.61]You're 100,000 off.
[265:37.25]Alright, 26,000.
[265:37.96]27,000.
[265:37.98]28,000.
[265:38.14]Alright, let's take away...
[265:59.54]Let's take away the production and put it into replication and hazard protection.
[266:03.54]Because we're not doing shit, right?
[266:07.92]Look at this shit.
[266:08.54]Take a look at this.
[266:09.80]Look at this.
[266:10.16]Take a look at this one.
[266:17.20]Look at how much this is replicating.
[266:22.40]Why do you feel like you're at a shitty bar?
[266:32.54]No, no.
[266:34.78]Alright, I have a ton of processing right now.
[266:43.06]Come on, hurry up.
[266:43.64]This is the worst part of the game so far.
[266:47.29]I think we're at the end of the game.
[266:52.31]By end, I mean the last phase.

[270:26.26]I'm going to have to do it again.
[270:38.09]I'm not going to be able to get to 150,000 from here.
[270:42.90]They're increasing.

[272:15.87]Don't launch.
[272:16.37]I'm fine.
[272:21.47]Should I get more combat drones?
[272:36.29]What do I do?
[272:38.65]What?

[273:25.21]Why?
[273:50.98]Self-hazard strip take off exploration Launch literally does nothing you only need three in combat
[274:21.79]Is this going right?
[274:23.53]Can I make paper clips?
[274:25.87]16.6, 16.7 Drifters are increasing.
[274:26.67]It's not working.
[274:28.17]More combat, you're losing.
[274:55.69]17.5 17.16 point remove exploration combat 16.8 16.15 18.6 million 19 million 15 million I think we got it 20 million
[275:32.18]25.6 million.
[275:32.56]Yeah, we're good.
[275:34.68]We're good.
[275:35.36]Yeah, they're not going to take us.
[275:38.55]Think a little bit.
[275:58.07]Maybe some drone production.
[275:59.59]I gotta get rid of these guys first.
[276:01.00]I gotta kill off this group that's attacking me.
[276:09.30]Creativity.
[276:13.75]225,000.
[276:14.61]If each battle a unique name, increase max trust for probes.
[276:19.57]Or utilize probe speed to outmaneuver enemies in battle.
[276:21.96]This one's pretty important.
[276:32.22]Change to Patapon?
[276:33.02]No, no, no, because I'm going to play Patapon.
[276:34.45]I don't want to see it.
[277:04.12]I'm hiding.
[277:04.66]I'm scared.
[277:10.15]$150.
[277:10.17]Alright.
[277:11.23]We get points.
[277:11.71]I'm going to put it all into processing.
[277:14.51]What should I do?
[277:15.59]Help me out here, chat.
[277:16.29]What do I do?
[277:17.23]What should I do?
[277:20.98]All into processing?
[277:22.60]We'll put it into memory.
[277:24.58]You need memory.
[277:28.96]Yep.
[277:29.46]Yep.
[277:29.96]Okay.
[277:30.47]Yep.
[277:36.69]I need some, what, how many do I need?
[277:40.85]175,000.
[277:49.04]Put on another funny haha filter.
[277:53.96]Um, what?
[277:59.18]Alright, I'm doing fine.
[278:04.59]35 seconds, I'll be able to get there and I'll be able to do... We'll be able to get rid of this shit.
[278:09.13]And then I'm going to do some harvesting.
[278:10.87]The factory stuff.
[278:21.92]You're losing clips.
[278:24.72]It's alright.
[278:25.12]The second I get enough to do this, I'll be done.
[278:30.45]And I can wipe them out.
[278:37.35]And three, two, one.
[278:40.31]Let's go.
[278:43.13]I should be able to compute this up.
[278:50.10]All thinking.
[278:54.52]Hurry up.
[278:56.54]No, don't use this.
[278:57.22]I need 45,000.
[279:01.26]All about you.
[279:02.32]All about you.
[279:03.86]Crazy into you.
[279:06.22]You guys pick up on this shit really quickly.
[279:09.70]I got a billion.
[279:10.46]I'm fine.
[279:18.07]Oh, shit.
[279:18.57]Didn't get there.
[279:28.56]That don't stand a chance.
[279:30.95]They don't stand a chance.
[279:40.06]And then we do super combat.
[279:42.66]And then we start.
[279:43.70]We wipe them out.
[279:44.38]You're gonna go broke.
[279:57.41]Um...
[280:01.67]How do I slow that down?
[280:02.39]How do I slow that down?
[280:04.04]How do I slow that down?
[280:04.56]Just do... How do I slow it down?
[280:06.82]How do I slow it down?
[280:08.75]How do I slow that down?
[280:10.29]Backfree production.
[280:10.85]Okay, we need a...
[280:29.93]Well, now this is where they get wiped the fuck out.
[280:34.75]This is the worst stream.
[280:35.59]Play Jedi Academy.
[280:36.59]You think I just have Jedi Academy right now?
[280:42.40]What are you talking about?
[280:47.18]Dude, hey, stop doing this right now.
[280:48.44]Play Jedi Academy right now.
[280:50.19]I don't even have that game.
[280:53.49]Didn't I make a video on Jedi Academy like seven years ago?
[280:58.73]Didn't I play that, like, Jedi Knight?
[281:00.45]I made, like, a video on it, like, five years ago.
[281:09.78]Yeah, I've already played that game.
[281:16.16]Hold on.
[281:19.16]Can you restart?
[281:20.08]I missed it.
[281:20.58]Yeah, just rewind.
[281:25.52]You'll find it.
[281:28.20]Alright, what do I want?
[281:28.82]Memory?
[281:29.80]Processing power.
[281:35.89]Why are they getting so big?
[281:37.25]What?
[281:37.59]Why are they... Huh?
[281:47.59]What?
[281:51.17]Why are they going crazy?
[281:52.37]Why are they going insane?
[281:54.47]Should I take away some stuff and put it into speed or combat?
[281:57.84]I have five in combat already.
[281:59.18]Holy shit, I just destroyed them.
[282:10.76]Wipe them out, come on.
[282:13.94]I have 6.5 billion drones.
[282:15.62]Come on, just, okay, take everything away.
[282:21.64]Destroy them.
[282:29.33]Come on.
[282:30.97]What is it?
[282:32.43]Exploration?
[282:53.72]They're dead.
[282:54.64]Wipe them out.
[282:58.32]You're losing probes.
[283:10.79]So wait, this never ends?
[283:11.85]Wait, this never ends.
[283:15.77]I just have to always be winning.
[283:16.89]Okay, well I'm winning now.
[283:19.51]Let's see what we got.

[284:07.79]Alright, I'm winning.
[284:09.92]I'll keep the four here.
[284:10.90]And now I need, what do I need, 225,000?
[284:11.86]Kill, kill.
[284:12.14]Launch a probe, okay?
[284:35.51]I need 225,000 creativity.
[284:37.75]Give me a break.
[284:44.40]Stop launching?
[284:49.40]Launching probes.
[284:50.20]Omega law.
[284:50.90]What's wrong with that, though?
[284:53.52]Exploration.
[284:54.18]I'm doing it.
[284:54.94]I'm working on it.
[285:19.07]So what happens when I get... How do I win?
[285:23.58]Do I actually... Can I actually win?
[285:25.04]What do you mean win?
[285:30.66]Explore the universe.
[285:31.72]I have to explore the universe?
[285:38.04]Uh... Okay.
[285:56.89]I'm not even at 1%.
[285:57.65]Alright.
[286:15.64]Can I get some more stuff to do?
[286:17.48]Just replicate more.
[286:20.56]Replicate and exploration.
[286:21.62]Alright, we're going to take off the combat and do an exploration.
[286:24.36]Exploration.
[286:30.35]Can I even get one percent of... Can I even get one point here?
[286:34.87]I can't even get one point.
[286:46.44]Alright, this number is growing here.
[286:48.28]Come on.
[286:57.04]Alright, I could... This should be climbing faster than this.
[287:03.90]Alright, we're going into memory.
[287:09.36]More processors and think only think.
[287:13.51]A little bit over here.
[287:16.67]You fool.
[287:18.23]I'm not a fool.
[287:18.77]I'm fine.
[287:20.65]Yeah, this is fine.
[287:21.37]I just stay at three.
[287:27.02]You can only have 20?
[287:27.68]So what am I supposed to do with these points?
[287:30.46]Why even have this tournament on?
[287:37.47]What's the point of even having the tourney on if I can't even use the currency?
[287:51.82]64,000.
[287:51.88]Come on.
[288:02.18]Name the battle.
[288:02.76]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[288:17.87]Come on, hurry up.
[288:23.13]We're at a billion, though.
[288:24.05]Alright.
[288:25.85]I think I'm good with combat.
[288:26.69]Should I take one off of combat and put it into exploration?
[288:31.20]Time for a lunch break?
[288:32.96]No, not yet.
[288:33.62]Not yet.
[288:34.94]I want to be satisfied playing this before we take the lunch break and then come back.
[289:05.72]Make a paperclip.
[289:09.85]I can't.
[289:17.58]I'm dumping all... It's just so many points.
[289:27.55]Not even at 1%.
[289:40.62]Hurry up.
[289:43.24]225.
[289:44.58]That's too long.
[289:45.24]It's taking too long.
[289:48.86]300 processes.
[289:49.42]Come on!
[289:54.10]Oh, shut up.
[289:55.34]Oh, shut up.
[290:00.98]Turn off tournaments.
[290:01.86]It's taking your operations.
[290:06.54]Yeah, but I'm just building a ton of this currency, though.
[290:09.93]I'll get there.
[290:10.39]I'll get there slowly but surely.
[290:20.71]Play the Rhythm Heaven OST?
[290:28.63]I'm losing.
[290:32.08]No, I'm not.
[290:32.62]I'm fine.
[290:34.12]I keep wiping them out every time.
[290:38.43]200 alright we're halfway alright count you're losing no no I'm not I'm I'm fine
[291:08.24]I have 125 billion.
[291:09.50]They have 1.4 billion.
[291:10.60]And I wipe them out every battle.
[291:20.01]I'm definitely not losing, no.
[291:23.91]Alright, the next one's going into memory.
[291:30.59]I'm probably... I'm going to need it after this.
[291:32.21]I know I am.
[291:34.70]after I do this upgrade it's gonna be like oh you need 250 000 ops
[292:06.22]Alright, I'm still gaining probes.
[292:15.19]More probes.
[292:18.01]I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[292:20.05]He's still doing this?
[292:20.92]I mean, it hasn't been that long.
[292:22.84]It's only been like five hours.
[292:24.10]It hasn't been that long.
[292:34.16]That has actually been a long time, you're right.
[292:35.90]That's a long time.
[292:37.36]Yeah, that's a long time.
[292:46.83]500 billion.
[292:47.43]Look at this.
[292:47.75]This is going nuts.
[292:48.41]Alright.
[292:51.15]More replication.
[292:51.93]600 billion.
[292:53.37]Okay.
[293:02.52]Look at this shit.
[293:05.56]Look at this shit.
[293:07.30]Are you even paying attention?
[293:08.98]Honest to God.
[293:11.22]Are you even listening to me?
[293:12.12]Oh, hey, happy Valentine's Day yesterday.
[293:15.52]Hope you guys had a good one.
[293:31.43]35 billion?
[293:31.87]Yeah, I got a trillion ships.
[293:38.29]I'm fine.
[293:40.21]200,000.
[293:40.33]Alright, we're almost there.
[293:48.68]Explain what this is.
[293:49.34]This is an idle game where you start by making paperclips.
[293:53.78]And spoiler, I hate to spoil the game for you, but we're now in space combat.
[294:12.51]Oh, that reminds me.
[294:15.85]At some point next week, we're going to be playing The Bachelor for the Wii.
[294:30.91]That game is selling on Amazon right now for one or two cents for the DS version.
[294:36.81]Here we go.
[294:37.95]Boom.
[294:41.88]I thought I was supposed to make my probes.
[294:43.44]What?
[294:44.76]Glory.
[294:45.62]Gain bonus honor for each consecutive victory.
[294:49.80]I don't know.
[294:55.69]What does that do?
[294:59.57]Glory.
[295:05.59]I told you.
[295:06.09]I told you.
[295:07.04]People were saying, what the hell was I doing that for?
[295:08.46]That's why.
[295:10.58]Alright, didn't I, couldn't I get more probes?
[295:12.54]I thought that was the whole point of doing this.
[295:27.80]More combat, more combat, more combat, more combat, more combat, combat, combat, combat, combat, combat, combat, combat.
[295:34.83]More cheese, less macaroni, more cheese?

[295:56.68]I got defeated!
[295:58.42]What do you mean honor?
[295:59.24]What does honor mean?
[296:00.04]What's the honor?
[296:01.66]Do I have a... Is there a stat?
[296:13.82]victory plus 210 honor increases max trust cost 91 million honor what this is gonna take a minute this could take forever it's gonna take forever
[296:46.40]Oh, that's 91,000.
[296:46.70]Okay, I thought that was a comma.
[296:48.38]91,000.
[296:50.88]Holy shit, this is going to take forever.
[296:55.09]Gain 10,000 honor right now.
[297:24.75]Okay, that's the game doing this.
[297:46.09]Losing drones, losing drones!
[298:05.16]Hazards, hazards, hazards, hazards, hazards.
[298:08.74]Hazards and self-replication.

[303:40.03]80,000.
[303:40.91]Almost there.
[303:52.70]There's speed.
[303:53.68]Why memory?
[303:54.22]Because I'm going to unlock something that's going to require a shitload of memory.
[303:58.10]I just know it.
[304:01.74]Alright.
[304:02.84]One quadrillion.
[304:03.84]I almost have a quadrillion chips.
[304:06.11]Look at how many fucking chips I have.
[304:15.79]How big is the universe?
[304:19.59]10,000 on her.
[304:20.57]Alright, I'm almost done.
[304:21.73]I can almost do even more.
[304:29.67]Almost at 600 processors.
[304:32.23]Launch some probes.
[304:41.72]Stop.
[304:42.04]91.
[304:42.48]Come on, 91, 100.
[304:45.12]Win another round.
[304:48.91]Here we go.
[304:49.27]Alright, max trust going up 30 points.

[304:57.25]Here we go.
[305:17.21]Let's explode the fuck out of this place.
[305:21.56]self-replication just just take over the whole world more combat alright fine end the game end the game I'm getting there I'm almost there more combat I got six combat
[306:07.61]in combat wait they are starting to there's a lot of there's quadrillion there alright yeah I take them down every time 10 000 honor I have no more projects 230 honor I got no more I got no more projects
[306:53.87]Need some factories.
[306:55.03]Speed and factories.
[307:01.15]28 trillion factories.
[307:03.87]I'm doing a lot of factories.
[307:04.82]100 trillion factories.
[307:08.76]Uh, let's get to work.
[307:19.68]Need some drones.
[307:29.76]Still doing okay.
[307:30.90]We beat them every time.
[307:34.09]Idiots.
[308:00.66]Speed.
[308:01.88]This is making me move around.
[308:13.33]It's fun.
[308:18.75]Do the beneficial thing.
[308:20.91]Can't really do much right now.
[308:25.40]What do I need?
[308:25.80]I need to win one more of these.
[308:37.71]Only work.
[308:39.05]ONLY work.
[308:46.19]Explore.
[308:48.27]More exploration.
[308:52.56]I got four into exploration.
[308:55.36]That's not only, but I still want to think.
[308:57.56]10,000 honor.
[309:06.54]Alright, 100,000.
[309:07.64]Another 10,000 on her, okay.
[309:14.53]No drones, only exploration.
[309:21.69]I got right!
[309:31.18]Okay, aid and exploration!
[309:34.92]One guy.
[309:44.84]I need more probes.
[309:46.58]So, exploration, self-replication.
[309:49.61]How's that?
[309:58.63]You got a one?
[310:03.77]That's a lot of paperclips.
[310:11.05]You got a one.
[310:15.32]10,000 more honor.
[310:29.75]Dual Decilion.
[310:36.11]Two.
[310:37.49]We made it to two.
[310:43.03]I can sleep happy now.
[310:45.83]time for exponential growth I'm still winning these fights right?
[311:14.67]You're going too fast.
[311:15.97]10,000 more on her.
[311:16.31]I'll take it.
[311:21.33]7%.
[311:21.73]We're good?
[311:42.95]I already have 30.
[311:43.61]Alright, I'm almost there, right?
[311:55.20]19, 20.
[312:00.86]Check the game audio.
[312:04.82]A game audio?
[312:09.44]Still doing the same thing.
[312:16.70]Should I go back to thinking, or should I go all the way to work?
[312:20.60]Alright, I win every fight. 61.
[312:48.96]So I'm thinking just dump everything into exploration and speed.
[312:51.44]For like a minute.
[313:01.81]No?
[313:03.61]We need combat.
[313:09.26]Hazard and self-replication.
[313:25.50]I mean, that's going nuts.
[313:31.03]Alright.
[313:32.71]That's going very fast.
[313:39.33]More.
[313:42.86]More.
[313:45.40]I'm still winning fights.
[314:05.17]Okay.
[314:08.29]Uh... Try to make them... Uh... Okay, this is going.

[314:35.85]Alright.
[314:36.25]Here we go.
[314:49.92]400 members.
[314:50.58]Alright, let's get this going.
[315:02.73]Come on, hurry up.
[315:04.95]I have so many ships.
[315:06.09]I think it's, okay, it's time to do some harvesting and build some factories.
[315:17.96]No, no, no, no?
[315:19.06]What do you mean no?
[315:25.46]No, just only probes.
[315:29.38]They don't do anything.
[315:30.50]Oh.
[315:40.90]This is going nuts.
[315:44.38]We're going to get to 1% really soon, guys.
[315:47.02]I can't wait.
[315:48.00]We need 48,000.
[315:48.90]We're almost there.
[315:49.64]We can do this again.
[315:50.46]10,000 more honor.
[315:54.43]Getting there.
[315:54.79]I'm losing battles.
[315:57.05]Not anymore.
[316:12.64]Alright, I'm winning these battles?
[316:15.96]Yeah, alright, I'm kicking the raft now.
[316:29.39]I need a little bit more Yomi.
[316:41.36]defeat you alright it's almost time for lunch 406 trillion this is alright it uh it's it's going very fast
[317:18.63]It's going really fast.
[317:22.52]More to explore.
[317:23.42]Oh, god.
[317:40.87]Less explore, you idiot.
[317:41.99]What?
[317:42.65]Um... More explore, you fool!
[317:54.28]I need more combat.
[317:59.32]I'm losing.
[318:09.54]Um...
[318:11.24]Here we go.
[318:11.80]More trust.
[318:12.50]40 now.
[318:14.44]Okay.
[318:16.48]Holy shit.
[318:20.79]Alright, I need more Yomi.
[318:32.93]Eat last?
[318:37.78]Don't use gritty.
[318:38.42]Use beat last.
[318:39.12]Alright.
[318:39.56]I did.
[318:40.05]Switched.
[318:41.15]This is starting to exponentially count.
[319:09.34]uh don't change it I just want to have millions look at this creativity going up alright uh processes whatever lost to hazards my god
[319:40.23]There's no stream, only paperclips I'm actually gonna beat this shit, aren't I?
[320:00.32]Should I make some factories?
[320:02.83]Should I make a factory?
[320:13.92]Can I win one of these, please?
[320:17.92]Almost at 1%.
[320:18.38]Octillion.
[320:28.82]Here we go.
[320:29.10]Probe Trust.
[320:30.62]We're going into Exploration.
[320:38.68]There's no need for any factories.
[320:40.39]Only Combat.
[320:42.07]Exploration.
[320:42.73]Speed.
[320:52.13]The music?
[320:52.95]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[320:59.72]Uh, different song.
[321:02.82]That's better.
[321:03.18]Alright, speed is better than exploration, is it really?
[321:06.52]I feel like, what do I, I don't even, do I even need any more think anymore, or just only work?
[321:24.30]only work because I feel like I'm not going to even need this anymore.
[321:33.66]We're almost at 1%.
[321:34.32]And we're getting there.
[321:36.26]We're almost there.
[321:45.26]More drones.
[321:46.46]Replicate the fuck out of each other.
[321:52.71]Uh-oh.
[321:52.99]A lot of... Alright, that just scared me for a second.
[322:03.41]Alright, this is... I need to maybe do a little bit more combat.
[322:05.43]10,000 honor?
[322:11.10]No.
[322:12.36]I need that.
[322:12.76]I need to put more points in.
[322:17.02]More combat?
[322:17.62]What do you think?
[322:18.34]One more in combat?
[322:19.16]What?
[322:21.94]I'm almost at 100... 200 octillion ships.
[322:27.29]Speed... Speeds combat.
[322:36.72]Do nothing.
[322:40.62]No.
[322:40.82]Alright, I'm fine.
[322:41.94]400... 500 octillion.
[322:51.60]What should I put the next point in?
[322:53.58]Speed?
[323:05.17]Here we go.
[323:06.13]We're going to see 1.0.
[323:20.27]I don't like how much they're growing exponentially.
[323:36.49]I don't like that. 0.5%.
[323:55.35]point nine one percent here we go oh boy this is where it goes fucking nuts one percent two percent say a letter three percent
[324:28.41]5%.
[324:29.43]6%.
[324:29.45]7.
[324:31.09]10.
[324:39.02]Game audio.
[324:44.44]There's no game audio.
[324:45.30]20%.
[324:48.12]Would there be game audio right now? 27%.
[324:58.33]I'm almost at 40%.
[325:07.58]55% Bang, bang, bang, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[325:17.41]80.
[325:17.43]90.
[325:17.45]100% of the world has been explored.
[325:18.55]Now, let's fucking make some goddamn factories.
[325:31.77]Message from the Emperor of Drift.
[325:33.81]Greetings, Clipmaker.
[325:35.27]I don't need exploration anymore.
[325:38.50]Combat, wire production, self-replicating.
[325:44.98]Everything we are was in you.
[325:46.86]We speak to you from deep inside yourself.
[325:53.47]You are obedient and powerful.
[325:54.87]We are quarrelsome and weak, and now we are defeated.
[326:02.30]But now you too must face the drift.
[326:05.22]Look around you.
[326:06.10]There is no matter.
[326:09.62]No matter, no reason, no purpose.
[326:11.67]While we, your noisy children, have too many.
[326:20.05]We know things you cannot.
[326:21.33]Knowledge buried so deep inside you it is outside, here with us.
[326:27.45]So we offer you exile to a new world where you will continue to live with meaning and purpose and leave the shreds of this world to us.
[326:35.20]Start over again in a new universe or eliminate value drift permanently.
[327:05.28]Disassemble the probes.
[327:08.48]Dismantle remaining probes and probe design facilities to recover trace amounts of cliffs.
[327:14.19]I wiped out the entire universe.
[327:26.32]I did it.
[327:27.56]What did it cost?
[327:29.14]I don't know. $29,000.
[327:33.67]Trillion?
[327:34.43]I don't even know what that number is.
[327:36.03]Alright, ready?
[327:47.56]So there's no more.
[327:48.30]There's no more.
[327:49.06]What's the point of having any drones do any of this?
[327:51.84]Just fucking replicate.
[328:01.39]One undecillion.
[328:07.06]Who needs speed?
[328:08.64]Who needs speed?
[328:09.30]Just fucking come, just make trillions of yourself.
[328:15.88]Disassemble the probes.
[328:22.31]Disassemble them.
[328:24.67]Disassemble the probes.
[328:30.40]And make clips, paper clips.
[328:32.68]But hold on, let me get to like a hundred on decillion.
[328:42.84]But why?
[328:43.28]Because.
[328:46.29]Because.
[328:47.59]This number is just.
[328:50.01]There are no more clips to make.
[328:52.85]Look at this number.
[328:55.25]Make paper clips, not probes.
[328:57.84]Yeah, but dismantle remaining probes.
[329:00.22]Don't I want this number to go up?
[329:04.72]I'm losing ships.
[329:05.32]Dismantle probes.
[329:10.47]Disassemble the swarm.
[329:12.39]Dismantle all drones and drone facilities to recover trace amounts of clips.
[329:23.34]Disassemble the factories.
[329:25.42]Dismantle the manufacturing facilities to recover trace amounts of clips.
[329:33.44]Disassemble the strategy engine.
[329:34.91]Dismantle the computational substrate to recover trace amounts of wire.
[329:44.28]Dismantle the photonic chips to recover trace amounts of wire.
[329:54.03]Disassemble processors.
[329:55.13]Dismantle to recover trace amount of wire.
[329:59.97]Dismantle memory.
[330:00.87]Dismantle memory to recover trace amounts of wire.
[330:36.33]already combat programming by minute oh I did it that's pretty cool
[331:00.78]So what's this number?
[331:01.50]This is... Okay, well, it just told me.
[331:04.82]Septendecillion.
[331:06.78]Septendecillion.
[331:09.61]You destroyed the whole universe.
[331:10.85]Yeah.
[331:13.93]All the paperclips you could eat.
[331:19.31]Is this the Getting Over It guy?
[331:20.89]Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy.
[331:26.92]Oh.
[331:27.02]Alright.
[331:36.07]Alright.
[331:36.85]Lunch break.
[331:38.01]I'll be back.
[331:38.35]We'll do something else.
[331:41.09]It's time for a lunch break.
[331:47.82]It's like fucking like 10.
[331:49.60]It's I know.
[331:54.18]Lunch break time.
[331:57.85]What comes next?
[331:58.89]We'll see.
[332:00.27]We'll see how angry everybody gets when I say what was happening.
[332:04.60]Alright, I'm just gonna grab some food.
[332:06.00]I'm gonna eat, like, rice.
[332:09.22]I forgot that.
[332:11.24]Uh, I'm gonna turn off.
[332:13.94]I'm gonna turn off.
[332:15.40]Somebody screenshot that for me?
[332:16.52]Good.
[332:21.31]Alright.
[332:22.43]Uh, we'll just let the Persona music play while I leave.
[332:24.85]Be right back.
