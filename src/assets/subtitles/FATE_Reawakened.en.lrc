[ve:61.1.100]

[00:32.55]How are you doing?
[00:35.91]Good evening.
[00:36.47]What's up?
[00:43.12]Good morning.
[00:43.98]Wait, actually, it is probably morning for some of you.
[00:50.30]This is a sleep stream.
[00:52.46]Well, for you, not for me.
[00:54.07]I've been holding on to that joke for like a full day.
[01:03.77]It's 2 a.m.
[01:05.46]Hey, well, perfect.
[01:06.38]Perfect sleep stream.
[01:11.26]Why put it in emote only?
[01:12.36]Why?
[01:13.90]Everyone just got here.
[01:17.78]So today, there's a couple games that I want to play.
[01:22.74]And just play them.
[01:24.52]Chill.
[01:27.76]Dial the energy down maybe a little bit tonight.
[01:29.54]I want to play Fate.
[01:35.76]Fate is an old game that they just remastered?
[01:41.13]I don't know.
[01:44.92]But the developer of this game... By the way, this could be completely wrong.
[01:50.86]The developer of this game, the original one, went on to make Torchlight with one of or two of the original Diablo devs?
[02:02.34]And then they all made a new company and they made some... The history of Diablo II, and the stuff that happened after,
[02:11.56]is wild.
[02:12.44]There's a big history here.
[02:14.57]But I believe that the developer of this game ended up making Torchlight.
[02:18.07]Eventually.
[02:18.99]Somehow.
[02:22.31]Is this an eclipse tonight?
[02:25.47]Bro.
[02:27.98]Is it an eclipse?
[02:30.42]Is it a total eclipse?
[02:34.04]It's a blood moon?
[02:37.96]Yikes.
[02:43.49]What does that even mean?
[02:44.21]What does a blood moon mean?
[02:45.67]What's that mean?
[02:52.49]I don't know.
[02:53.13]Red.
[02:53.39]Oh, our education system needs to be fucking fixed.
[02:59.55]Oh, boy.
[02:59.97]Hey, guys, what's a blood moon mean?
[03:02.47]I don't know.
[03:03.19]Red, I guess.
[03:07.18]And I'm including myself in this, by the way.
[03:09.36]Because I don't know what it was.
[03:11.96]When Earth does what?
[03:15.77]It's when Earth... Earth eclipses the moon.
[03:22.99]Cool.
[03:31.60]Yeah, I have a space background and I don't know what... But I don't... Yeah, I have a bunch of space theming, don't I?
[03:43.20]I've got meteors, I've got planets...
[03:47.97]My branding's all over the place, guys.
[03:49.41]My branding hasn't been updated in 11 years.
[03:54.77]Even on the starting soon screen, there's been planets that have been added to the emotes that you don't use that aren't even on the starting soon screen.
[04:13.00]What are some of the other ones that we have here?
[04:19.14]Yeah.
[04:20.24]Yeah, I don't know.
[04:21.26]Isn't there a Mars?
[04:22.14]Isn't there a Neptune?
[04:23.56]I swear there's a Neptune.
[04:29.67]Apparently.
[04:33.19]I love Fate.
[04:33.77]Thanks for playing it.
[04:35.11]I think this came out today or last night or something, right?
[04:45.93]Yeah, let me... I think ads are going to start to play here to get rid of the pre-rolls.
[04:51.76]They haven't shown up yet, but they will.
[04:54.06]They always do.
[04:56.58]Let me make a tea.
[04:57.22]I'm not quite ready yet.
[04:57.90]I just want to go live to make sure people knew I was going to be here.
[05:02.24]So, because I said 6 and then I said 6.30 and now it's 6.45.
[05:05.28]So...
[05:08.83]They are supposed to start in about one minute.
[05:12.03]So let me get my tea, let me get my shit ready, and we'll play some Fate.
[05:14.27]We're gonna just chill.
[05:15.41]There's a few games I might want to jump to today, so... Chill out.
[05:21.36]Get yourself some, uh... I don't know.
[05:24.16]Just fucking wait.
[05:25.58]I'll be back.
[05:27.18]Just wait a minute.
[05:29.04]I was gonna be, like, chilled about it, but no.
[05:30.80]Just wait.
[05:31.30]Alright, here I be.
[10:12.99]Alright.
[10:14.63]I just sat back down.
[10:15.83]I'm good.
[10:16.27]Pre-roll should be off for an hour.
[10:20.13]Excellent.
[10:20.75]As we're ready to game.
[10:25.44]Ready to drift off to a nice sound sleep.
[10:29.18]To the sound of my voice.
[10:30.30]That's right.
[10:32.40]Gonna be trying a new thing on this channel.
[10:36.14]Where... We... You've relaxed to the sound of my voice.
[10:45.78]I'll start over.
[10:46.32]Alright.
[10:47.82]Yeah, let's play.
[10:49.60]So for all you fate people that know this game and understand what I'm looking at here.
[10:57.22]I... I played this one.
[11:02.39]There are apparently four games.
[11:03.77]Are these expansions?
[11:04.67]What are these?
[11:07.97]This game is absolutely goaded.
[11:12.48]Should I just do the original?
[11:15.16]Or are these all... Is this DLC?
[11:16.84]These expansions?
[11:18.60]Start with the original?
[11:21.16]Or is it do the Cursed King?
[11:22.58]Because it's got all the content from all these.
[11:27.82]Just do the OG?
[11:34.77]Alright, we'll do the OG.
[11:35.61]Okay.
[11:42.95]So it kind of looks like Fable, but it is not like Fable.
[11:45.69]It's more like Diablo.
[11:52.08]Okay.
[11:55.44]How hard is Adventurer to Legend?
[12:03.08]Do a hardcore run?
[12:06.26]No.
[12:07.83]It's been like 15 years since that, or 20.
[12:10.61]It's no longer than that.
[12:13.45]It's gotta be about 25 years since I played this.
[12:18.39]This is normal.
[12:19.13]This is hard.
[12:19.87]Let's just do normal.
[12:20.81]We don't have to do anything crazy.
[12:28.59]Yeah, I think these are remastered graphics too.
[12:30.86]I think the game is... This game is hard as fuck.
[12:33.18]Just do normal.
[12:33.96]Okay.
[12:34.62]Alright, that's good.
[12:38.17]Alright, I'm a human.
[12:39.85]Humans are the most abundant race in the realms.
[12:41.69]While not as quick or strong as other races, humans are well-rounded and possess an innate skill of magic that makes them formidable foes in any match.
[12:48.93]Okay.
[12:50.94]Shadow elf.
[12:53.12]Stealthy and secretive.
[12:54.50]Little is known about shadow elves.
[12:56.50]Relying on bows and haste magic.
[12:58.10]Okay, this is ranged.
[13:01.06]Purple.
[13:05.08]Alright, so this is range and then some magic.
[13:10.16]Half-orc?
[13:10.76]This is what it would look like if I tried to do an Incredible Hulk cosplay.
[13:35.29]You end up just being WoW Goblin.
[13:41.03]That's what I would be.
[13:43.19]Okay.
[13:44.67]Cogger.
[13:46.71]Coggers are rumored to be descendants of a lost civilization.
[13:49.24]So it's like a mecha gnome?
[13:52.16]I don't remember all these.
[13:53.14]I thought it was just you were just the default guy.
[13:55.48]Just the guy.
[13:56.12]That like default guy.
[13:58.44]I don't know they were like mecha gnomes in the game.
[14:01.60]I didn't know that.
[14:07.64]Powerful secrets.
[14:10.10]Coggers still observe the ritual of modifying their bodies with strange machines that enhance their defense.
[14:14.55]This is like defense and... Imp?
[14:20.66]Imps are whimsical tricksters.
[14:22.44]Ooh, their ancestors are rumored to have climbed out of a deep crevice that opened in the desert thousands of years ago.
[14:29.72]Other ancient texts suggest they were summoned from the dimensional plane of fire by a demented sorcerer who tried to enslave them.
[14:36.89]So, guile and agile.
[14:39.07]The imps overthrew the sorcerer and spread... Okay, that seems kind of cool.
[14:51.05]I kind of like this, though.
[14:52.55]Should I just do imp?
[14:57.61]I feel like you all want me to do this.
[15:05.97]Okay, does it actually matter, though?
[15:07.33]Is there actually a stat implication to all this, or no?
[15:11.42]Is it just cosmetic?
[15:16.06]Yes, there is.
[15:20.85]Music's a little loud.
[15:22.59]Once I get to the options, I'll turn it down.
[15:25.89]Please don't.
[15:26.63]There are stat differences.
[15:28.15]Okay.
[15:30.09]Major implications.
[15:31.77]Imp is cooler.
[15:36.13]I think I'm going to just start with human.
[15:41.08]If I don't do human, then I would do imp.
[15:48.29]I've seen a lot of boos.
[15:51.50]Alright, fine.
[15:52.24]I will be an imp.
[15:55.16]Yeah, that was unanimous boos.
[15:57.78]You're right.
[15:58.42]I got booed a lot.
[16:00.98]How about this hairstyle?
[16:09.41]I'm just one of the... What?
[16:12.95]I was gonna say... Uppy guppy kids?
[16:15.75]No, oogie boogie kids.
[16:19.31]Why could I not think of his name for a second?
[16:21.13]That was weird.
[16:27.10]Boogie Boogie.
[16:31.64]From Nightmare Before Christmas.
[16:35.04]Okay, that sounds good.
[16:36.48]Name.
[16:36.82]Ooh.
[16:44.42]Chexer.
[16:47.00]I like it.
[16:51.44]Sometimes the random name generator, you get some good stuff.
[16:53.46]Alright, let's go.
[16:56.63]That's name.
[16:57.99]Uh, of course.
[17:04.85]We can have a... That is Otto.
[17:08.53]That's Otto.
[17:09.33]That actually is Otto.
[17:13.48]He kind of looks like a little pig sometimes.
[17:18.63]Okay, take your thumb, put it over his head, and you tell me that that's not Otto.
[17:27.39]Otto has kind of a big butt, and he's a little stalky.
[17:30.97]That's Otto.
[17:36.93]Since oldest living memory, the dungeon gate has stood in the heart of the old wood.
[17:43.43]Its doorway leads to infinite possibility.
[17:45.83]It is supposed to be hard, isn't it?
[17:46.81]To subterranean lands fabled in stories and myths.
[17:51.49]Many adventurers have passed over that ancient threshold, some to find fame, glory, and wealth beyond telling, and others never to return.
[18:03.56]The town of Grove has ever been a safe haven at the dungeon's mouth.
[18:08.45]A watering hole and resting place for weary adventurers.
[18:13.17]Here great tales are told by the inn's fire.
[18:16.74]Why is this highlighting random words?
[18:19.26]I was going to ask that too.
[18:20.22]What is doing that?
[18:21.14]The mistressing of the great feats of heroes long gone.
[18:24.61]I feel like it's like Wikipedia pages, like journeys.
[18:27.01]Well, a journey is, it's a long adventure that takes people... A legacy is when somebody leaves a bunch of stuff behind.
[18:33.81]You and your faithful companion arrive at last in the fabled forest town, which waits beneath the long shadow of the gate.
[18:43.00]Within these walls lies the path to infinite adventure.
[18:48.10]It is here that you will test your worth and perhaps find fortune and glory along the way.
[18:54.71]I love the voice actor.
[18:55.49]Uh, when does the line happen when he goes, you feel refreshed?
[19:09.48]Wait, it's caveman mode!
[19:30.02]Holy shit, guys.
[19:30.90]It's caveman mode.
[19:31.68]Look at this.
[19:32.68]Tails, Scorp-Feline Elder, Kelzam.
[19:35.92]Centuries.
[19:36.64]Fortieth level.
[19:37.36]Seeping up.
[19:38.07]You.
[19:38.77]Once and for all.
[19:39.77]Evil influence.
[19:40.69]Fate?
[19:41.33]Meet it.
[19:43.05]That's what it is.
[19:43.73]If you read those, you can kind of get the gist of everything.
[19:50.24]Nice.
[19:52.66]Alright, welcome to the town of Grove.
[19:54.46]Go to the town and visit the shopkeepers and search for quests to perform.
[19:57.84]When you are ready, enter the dungeon gate to your right to begin your adventure.
[20:05.24]Cool, alright.
[20:07.16]Let's do some audio settings here.
[20:10.86]Uh, I already turned off screen shake.
[20:12.92]Love that I can do that.
[20:15.72]I'm gonna drop everything like 30%.
[20:16.96]Sounds kind of good, I think.
[20:19.70]How's the brightness?
[20:20.40]Are we good?
[20:29.67]Okay, so this is where the dungeon is.
[20:32.92]This way.
[20:36.50]There's Bottle Bee.
[20:41.42]Gets the Traveler.
[20:42.28]Uh, you have a stash.
[20:44.66]This is your storage trunk.
[20:45.95]You can place any item you like inside and they will always be here when you return.
[20:51.91]This is the inventory screen.
[20:52.93]Drag weapons and armor onto the top slot.
[20:54.77]Yeah, so you equip items.
[20:55.75]It's just like Diablo.
[20:56.47]Uh, here you can use, drop, and send items to your pet's inventory by dragging them to the pet's icon on the left.
[21:03.61]I think you can send your pet back to sell things.
[21:12.43]I have a spell.
[21:13.11]A fireball.
[21:13.81]Wait, is this a caster?
[21:16.83]Right click to use.
[21:18.13]Requires 15 magic.
[21:20.84]Town portal, health potion.
[21:24.38]Okay.
[21:29.08]Get a quest.
[21:32.92]Wanna buy something?
[21:33.70]Ooh, alright.
[21:36.41]I'm interested.
[21:39.91]Where's my money?
[21:40.45]How much money do I have?
[21:41.61]250 GP.
[21:43.53]Ah...
[21:48.47]Usually I would want to buy a book of portals.
[21:51.12]That's 500.
[21:52.14]I only have 200 bucks.
[21:53.42]Alright, let me just go kill some shit.
[22:02.39]Fire Elemental called Bixman the Blast that attacked a caravan of goods bound for town and took a valuable Mim's Fist from the wagons.
[22:09.94]It has retreated to level two.
[22:11.10]Okay, so how this one works, I think this game is just a dungeon that goes a certain amount of levels, kind of like Stardew Valley, where it's just, or Diablo, original Diablo.
[22:21.91]There's a town, and then you have to go down as far as you can.
[22:25.59]I think that's correct.
[22:28.03]Okay.
[22:29.07]Uh... If you return it to me, I can make it... I can make it up to you.
[22:31.83]I'll give you this short bow of basics.
[22:34.50]Sure.
[22:34.68]Alright.
[22:34.98]So kill the boss at level 2.
[22:37.94]Horde of Rubygells are skulking on level 3.
[22:41.48]Okay.
[22:44.06]Beasts... Beast Rod Great Axe Magician.
[22:46.56]Got it.
[22:46.80]Okay.
[22:55.02]Anything else to do?
[22:56.16]What about you?
[22:57.42]What do you got?
[23:03.18]One to six damage.
[23:03.90]Should I... I think... Maybe I just don't buy anything.
[23:06.00]I'll just go... Wait, quest... Alright.
[23:10.12]Breakwater.
[23:10.84]Level one.
[23:11.48]Town of Grove.
[23:12.82]Got it.
[23:13.82]I'm busy.
[23:14.10]Okay.
[23:26.62]How many quests?
[23:27.12]What do I got for quests?
[23:30.76]Oh, there's one down here.
[23:34.08]Oh, I can only have three quests.
[23:35.73]Can I only have up to three?
[23:36.53]Let's just go for it.
[23:44.07]Alright, let's do the dungeon.
[23:51.93]Three plus the main quest, right?
[23:53.95]Coffee, slow.
[23:56.37]Coffee's ability to move, slow.
[24:00.14]I don't have any moves or anything.
[24:01.24]I'm just kind of going.
[24:02.68]We're looking for... What was it?
[24:06.56]Fate statue looms.
[24:07.60]Will you tempt fate and pry the gems from the statue?
[24:10.48]Yeah, do it.
[24:13.18]I just... That's the easiest game ever.
[24:16.74]Okay.
[24:19.84]You found a gemstone gem.
[24:21.45]That was a good sound effect by the way.
[24:23.73]Magic properties OK, so it's just like Diablo.
[24:26.81]Sockets can you upgrade these?
[24:28.97]I need to drop the audio a little bit more.
[24:34.64]How's that better?
[24:52.00]I think that's better.
[24:52.50]Okay.
[25:01.83]Let's go.
[25:02.17]I don't think I have any spells yet, do I?
[25:15.19]So those that played the original, does this look better than the original?
[25:20.98]How does this look in comparison to the original?
[25:22.40]That thing's kind of huge.
[25:23.28]Level 1?
[25:23.56]Your fame has increased.
[25:30.38]You've attained... What'd I get?
[25:32.47]I found a gold chain.
[25:35.95]The OG is very crunchy.
[25:37.53]Okay.
[25:46.00]Gold chain.
[25:46.62]I don't have an identify scroll.
[25:51.29]Oh here we go.
[25:53.78]So level 40 is where this thing is.
[25:55.78]So I'm looking for breakwater.
[26:10.53]It really is Diablo?
[26:11.53]Oh yeah.
[26:16.32]About how big is each zone?
[26:19.64]Racer level.
[26:20.06]Looks like it can go down.
[26:26.67]Would you say this is creamy?
[26:29.63]It's slightly buttery.
[26:46.36]Is this better than D4?
[26:48.84]You know... It probably is.
[27:03.31]I'm still looking for this... This guy wanted me to get something for level 1.
[27:05.88]I can't find it.
[27:14.59]Am I- these things with gold in it, can I get these?
[27:26.29]You probably played about four hours of D4.
[27:29.07]Um, I got to... Guys, I was killing bosses in D4 solo.
[27:34.05]The hard ones that you had to spend all the bullshit on.
[27:36.56]I had a Thorns build on Druid.
[27:38.90]Where I just stood around and things just died on the screen.
[27:41.78]And it was cool for the first, like... I played a fuckload of that game.
[27:45.54]Oh, I got a... I was... I had... I... What was that?
[27:53.45]I was in, like, full uniques.
[27:58.07]My inventory's full.
[28:00.55]Oh, wait, we gotta do the... Wait, okay, hold on.
[28:04.43]Got too much bullshit.
[28:08.27]There we go.
[28:10.22]This thing is pretty sick.
[28:11.04]So I have to bring this back.
[28:14.54]I got to level 100 in D4.
[28:19.18]Razorplate, that's what it was.
[28:20.18]Yeah, I was doing a razorplate build and... Alright, cool.
[28:27.24]Can I equip that?
[28:34.09]Requested ring.
[28:39.33]I mean, this doesn't have any properties.
[28:40.81]I'm just putting it on.
[28:44.28]Okay, cool.
[28:51.20]I'm not going back yet.
[28:55.56]I got plenty of room.
[28:56.38]Alright, so that's that one.
[28:57.42]Now I got to go down and do the next level two.
[28:59.22]There's something to do on level two.
[29:05.71]Is there a bigger map I can see?
[29:07.79]Oh, that's cool.
[29:08.39]Alright, M. That's up.
[29:20.83]I gotta go down.
[29:30.67]Ster called you up because he said that you said you didn't like D4 after everybody else did.
[29:34.44]You are exhausted.
[29:35.86]Um... I feel like me and Ster just talked shit about D4 every time we had a conversation.
[29:42.67]And that was including on stream.
[29:45.87]I think even like a week after D4 came out, it was just like, I don't like this game.
[29:57.00]Uh, yeah, stamina.
[30:00.22]You gotta wait till... Where is it?
[30:01.28]Where's the stamina meter?
[30:07.68]What was that?
[30:10.58]This is a huge fucking rat.
[30:23.35]Oh show items, isn't it?
[30:24.69]It's alt OK.
[30:25.47]Yeah, that's it there.
[30:26.77]Alright, so what I gotta do here?
[30:27.53]I gotta do something I had to do here.
[30:29.79]Is this guy gonna kill me?
[30:34.60]I think there's a guy I gotta kill.
[30:36.68]Nice.
[30:37.06]Alright, just... Ooh!
[30:44.98]Faster cast speed, mana stolen per hit, chance of blocking defense.
[30:48.87]These things are awesome!
[30:51.59]Do I have to give these back?
[30:52.71]Alright, destroy six ruby gels on level three.
[31:01.85]Alright, let's go.
[31:14.10]I thought D4 suffered from the same problem and we've talked about this on stream many times.
[31:20.89]It's like I just didn't feel like I was playing a video game.
[31:32.71]A lot of games come out and I just don't feel like I'm even playing a game.
[31:35.98]It just feels like the game is like playing itself in front of me.
[31:47.45]Alright, here we go.
[31:53.80]So, where do I get that screen?
[31:56.50]Ooh, let's go.
[32:00.48]You asked for food mode.
[32:01.94]Yeah, I asked to be able to toggle food mode.
[32:04.42]I don't want permanent food mode.
[32:12.44]Okay, what...
[32:17.06]I'm going to screw this whole character up, aren't I?
[32:19.60]What is the imp's main points?
[32:21.74]It looks like... Vitality and strength?
[32:25.92]Spellcasting?
[32:28.62]Don't do thorns.
[32:29.22]Well, that was like one of like eight characters I had that were pretty much max level.
[32:34.70]And you could make the argument, dude, you made like eight max level characters.
[32:38.44]I think you got your money's worth out of it.
[32:40.04]I think you liked it enough to do it.
[32:43.12]But I'm a Diablo II lunatic.
[32:46.60]It's like one of my favorite games of all time.
[32:48.78]So it's almost like I have to keep playing Diablo because it's Diablo.
[32:52.25]I love Diablo II.
[32:53.23]Deckard Cain, I love him.
[32:54.37]He's so funny and he's so cool.
[32:55.53]And I love Diablo and Mephisto Soulstone.
[33:00.63]That universe, I just like more than any of them.
[33:03.89]Alright, so should I be a caster?
[33:12.19]Just do all crit.
[33:18.58]Maybe I should just do all crit.
[33:26.04]Yeah, I played the remake.
[33:27.42]I loved the DC remake.
[33:28.64]That was great.
[33:30.80]Attack magic skill responsive attack magic.
[33:33.76]Yeah, it was supposed to be caster.
[33:36.13]Can you casting specific spell crit?
[33:47.37]Critical strike skill, dealing a crit.
[33:50.85]Crit is for everything.
[33:51.71]Ooh, OK.
[33:56.65]Was that stupid?
[34:03.47]Is this like D2 where you put every other point in vitality or does that not matter?
[34:21.07]Do magic missile.
[34:28.03]I want to do magic.
[34:32.01]I want to do spell crit magic attack magic skill crits.
[34:40.42]Do I have any spells?
[34:41.40]I thought I had one in my inventory.
[34:44.17]I have fireball.
[34:45.21]How do I use this?
[34:47.89]Ooh, OK.
[34:52.77]Mana cost, okay, 12 to 17 damage.
[34:56.18]Fireball flies straight, inflicting damage on impact.
[34:58.06]Goes to seven damage, two points damage per skill.
[35:00.16]Alright.
[35:10.90]I'm out of mana already.
[35:13.04]How did I miss every shot?
[35:23.89]Do I have mana potions?
[35:32.47]Are you going to do power wash too?
[35:34.29]I saw that.
[35:35.99]I mean, I think you know the answer to that question.
[35:37.81]Is that better?
[35:50.45]Absolutely not.
[35:51.49]No, I'm good.
[35:52.09]I'll do it.
[35:54.88]I'm down.
[35:56.82]When does it come out?
[35:57.32]I don't know.
[35:57.66]Maybe.
[35:57.88]So I want to buy some new spells.
[36:15.80]I want to do like Arcane Mage.
[36:20.64]Or... I don't know.
[36:26.88]Why does it still feel like it's like a little too loud?
[36:31.02]Am I crazy?
[36:50.55]This coming year, but there's no date.
[37:03.57]Some of the sound effects are a little odd.
[37:09.91]Okay, I gotta kill six of these ruby gels.
[37:19.44]Would you rather dip your toe in sulfuric acid or play and stream League of Legends for a week?
[37:26.04]How long do I have to hold my foot in the sulfuric acid for?
[37:37.37]Is it more than one second or is it two minutes?
[37:40.15]Uh, nope.
[37:41.75]I'll play League.
[37:46.74]Although, would the damage to my brain of doing that, would that be the equivalent damage, the physical damage to my foot?
[37:56.28]That's questionable.
[37:59.94]Ooh.
[38:02.66]Have I got a deal for you.
[38:07.09]What do you got?
[38:07.59]Oh, can I sell some of this stuff?
[38:12.33]Should I equip the lech off?
[38:16.93]Nice.
[38:17.29]100.
[38:26.38]OK, I need to buy this.
[38:33.12]OK, what should I identify?
[38:39.46]Alright, I made a profit.
[38:46.86]You only have two scrolls?
[38:52.56]Oh, 2% magic bonus.
[38:56.18]$2,600?
[38:56.42]I can't afford any of this.
[38:58.06]This stuff is too expensive.
[39:00.53]Let me buy a couple mana potions.
[39:06.93]This blew all my money on mana.
[39:15.58]Uh, do I really care about the... Well, this actually, look at how much this is worth.
[39:18.58]Wait a minute.
[39:22.56]Holy shit!
[39:24.55]What rarity is this?
[39:25.89]Is this a good item?
[39:32.43]4,700 bucks.
[39:35.99]What is this one?
[39:36.89]Oh my god, get rid of this thing.
[39:38.23]Put the little chop on.
[39:45.54]Gold find and magic find.
[39:46.56]Is magic find important in this game?
[39:47.68]Wait, how much is... I think I can sell this too.
[39:54.04]I don't need stamina potions.
[39:55.86]I'll take one stamina potion.
[39:57.24]I want health and mana.
[40:05.35]I just watched the long edit of Subnautica.
[40:10.83]Wait, from like four years ago?
[40:20.91]Okay, is there anything else I should really... Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[40:22.85]Spells.
[40:23.21]Here we go.
[40:25.05]Charm.
[40:25.55]Ooh, could I do summoning and a control mage or whatever?
[40:34.95]Divine Light.
[40:37.05]I kind of like that too.
[40:38.30]I need 28 magic.
[40:39.50]I kind of want Divine Light.
[40:40.82]6 to 10 damage to undead.
[40:44.86]Plus 2 points per attack skill level.
[40:48.98]Only for undead.
[40:52.87]Group fog.
[40:58.98]Is this lightning?
[40:59.72]Lightning.
[41:00.20]Mmm, yep.
[41:04.48]How much is this?
[41:07.22]5,000.
[41:08.92]Okay, do I sell the chop to get lightning strike?
[41:17.67]No?
[41:20.36]Do you guys think I should keep this piece of shit?
[41:30.22]I guess I just don't know what's valuable in this game.
[41:32.12]And that's really cool.
[41:34.08]Whenever you start like a new ARPG like this, these could be crazy valuable.
[41:39.38]I have no idea.
[41:40.38]And this is my, I should probably buy like a hundred of them.
[41:44.17]Alright.
[41:44.37]I'm good.
[41:44.97]I'm good.
[41:54.98]I don't know if this is a mistake or not.
[41:56.30]I don't know.
[41:57.44]Cool.
[41:59.06]Alright.
[41:59.76]Well, let's go.
[42:01.81]I'm not in any real danger at the moment, so that's fine.
[42:04.47]How many more of these is that going to kill?
[42:10.27]Ooh.
[42:19.40]Items are level based.
[42:22.74]Interesting.
[42:32.26]Let's chop.
[42:41.46]There was a crit right there.
[42:42.50]OK, now I know why you all want me to do crit, because I feel like that could be disgusting.
[42:49.86]What am I?
[42:54.94]There's two more ruby gel.
[42:56.02]It's just like the blood more.
[42:57.04]It's just like doing the den of evil.
[43:12.89]no it's fate that's right please correct me on that yeah I remember I remember this game because I remember it came with what with wild tangent was the platform for those that don't know wild tangent was it was a game web kind of game platform
[43:41.33]and holy shit okay I actually have to pay attention hold on uh and notoriously for me at least it kicked off my antivirus every single time I played it like I want to say like like mcafee 2001 did not like wild tangent at all it was just like dude do you understand that you this is a virus right
[44:08.74]And I'm like, is it?
[44:09.58]I don't know.
[44:09.96]I'm scared.
[44:11.52]I actually was scared of it for a while.
[44:13.50]But it had fate.
[44:14.50]It had a bunch of shit on it.
[44:15.56]And some of the games were actually pretty awesome.
[44:17.36]They were actually really good.
[44:28.57]What is hitting me?
[44:33.87]But I think it may have been like a false positive or something.
[44:36.81]I don't know.
[44:37.15]I remember just back in the day.
[44:38.17]It was a long time ago.
[44:43.26]I did all three quests are done.
[44:44.48]Alright now.
[44:49.80]Magic.
[44:51.98]Attack.
[44:55.00]Yeah.
[44:59.82]Cool.
[45:00.54]Alright.
[45:00.98]Attack magic skill.
[45:05.49]So this is +2 points of damage per attack skill level.
[45:09.51]So it's tied directly to the points.
[45:11.05]That's actually pretty cool.
[45:17.51]It would send your email to spam sites.
[45:22.49]I don't know.
[45:23.05]All I know is that it was... I remember downloading it and being scared of it.
[45:35.90]But they had some banger games on it, though, I will say.
[45:38.22]Alright, should I just town portal?
[45:46.17]And complete these?
[45:49.11]Do you ever play Virtual Villagers on Wild Tangent?
[45:57.15]No, I don't.
[45:57.83]I remember Fate.
[45:58.96]I don't.
[46:01.36]I don't remember a whole lot else, though.
[46:06.26]It's kind of like, um, do you remember PopCap?
[46:09.70]Remember original PopCap?
[46:11.28]PopCap before EA?
[46:15.00]There was a game for PopCap that it was one of my favorite online games.
[46:19.72]It was called Big Money's Money Bags or something.
[46:22.48]And you clicked on money bags that had to match in a row.
[46:25.75]And it was this Mr. Green kind of guy that was in the corner.
[46:27.85]And he was like, oh, yes, money, money.
[46:29.77]Is it called Big Money?
[46:37.05]Yeah, the OG PopCap had some of the best web browser based games in history.
[46:47.16]Bring back Bookworm.
[46:49.08]I would love to see a total renaissance of the game industry.
[46:51.38]I really would.
[46:52.56]Bring this shit back.
[46:55.10]Back to the basics.
[46:55.82]Let's get back to the basics.
[46:57.80]I don't want a fucking 10,000 hour 500 mission open world game.
[47:02.02]I want big money's money bags.
[47:13.59]Uh, ooh, you've received Ruby Gel Experience.
[47:16.19]What does that mean?
[47:19.28]Just threw it on the ground.
[47:20.82]I just got a sick item.
[47:24.40]What is this thing?
[47:27.52]Oh my fucking god, it's level 2.
[47:31.40]You're gonna give this to me at level 2?
[47:33.67]This thing is insane.
[47:34.67]What the hell?
[47:36.97]Okay, 8 fire damage, 20 to 40 attack.
[47:40.85]I'm gonna be at level 40 in 15 seconds.
[47:47.32]Oh, I can't use- it needs 80 strength!
[47:50.68]Oh, man.
[47:53.18]Can I just sell it?
[48:04.24]And make- make the artwork big- make it big as shit so I can see it.
[48:08.58]I want to see big artwork.
[48:12.89]I want big as shit artwork.
[48:14.53]I want artwork that's huge and takes up the whole screen.
[48:16.73]I don't want it in a cube this big.
[48:19.89]I don't want a cube this big.
[48:21.65]I want to see the axe.
[48:22.74]I want to feel the axe.
[48:23.54]I want to look at it.
[48:24.20]I want to move it around in my inventory.
[48:26.34]I want it to be like too big to move.
[48:28.66]I want it to be too huge.
[48:35.54]A POE does that though.
[48:37.47]I played a POE 2 already.
[48:39.29]It's really fun.
[48:44.68]It's very, very good.
[48:45.88]I like it a lot.
[48:48.68]You okay, dude?
[48:49.58]I'm doing good.
[48:50.98]Yeah, I just said I wanted to wait a little bit for PoE because... You know, get some updates in it.
[49:00.53]Okay, that was his money.
[49:03.69]The fastest cloak and artifact is... Okay, level six.
[49:07.43]Beast came in the night and they stole it away.
[49:09.03]I heard level six of... Okay, I got to go to level six and get it.
[49:18.58]Hack 3 was eye candy.
[49:19.90]Oh yeah, it was great.
[49:20.92]Holly and I played it a lot.
[49:25.16]I love the uniques in PeeWee.
[49:27.88]PeeWee uniques are so interesting because it's like, oh, what's this one?
[49:32.25]Identify.
[49:33.35]Oh, your character is on fire and takes 5,000% more fire damage.
[49:38.01]And will sing a song the whole time.
[49:40.09]And by the way, ice damage plus 10.
[49:42.73]It's like, what the fuck do I do with this?
[49:50.70]It's just wild shit.
[49:56.24]Level three?
[49:57.69]I was just at level three.
[50:02.67]Uh, Night Reaper the Rat.
[50:04.91]Level five.
[50:08.18]I actually really like this formula.
[50:09.92]I never really played this game.
[50:10.94]I remember, I played it, I was afraid it was a virus, uh, on Wild Tangent, remember?
[50:16.10]And I got to, I didn't really play it that much, but I said, damn, this is a really fun game, but I didn't play it.
[50:22.74]I like the system of, hey, here's some shit to do.
[50:24.99]Now go in that door you just went down and go down even further.
[50:34.13]I'm good just to keep going now.
[50:37.93]Let me sell a bunch of this crap, though.
[50:39.25]I don't need it.
[50:40.73]Is there an identifier?
[50:48.09]Can you do some fishing?
[50:50.11]What?
[50:50.27]What?
[50:53.80]What do you mean, go fishing?
[50:57.94]I need to, where do I get a fishing pole?
[50:59.08]Oh, I thought he was going to say it.
[51:10.71]Will you pay 10,000 gold to advance to the rank of unremarkable?
[51:22.41]Do you just keep prestiging in fate and just keep getting harder and harder?
[51:26.91]Is that how this works?
[51:29.37]Oh, yep.
[51:35.46]Oh.
[51:38.68]How much money do I got?
[51:39.62]2,800.

[54:32.14]And I was, uh, talking a little shit.
[54:35.48]It's funny, we're talking about, um, PopCap games.
[54:38.96]I saw Squeaks was playing Insane Aquarium.
[54:41.12]And I was so excited.
[54:42.48]I got my popcorn.
[54:43.70]I got, uh, I got a little Tabasco to put on the popcorn.
[54:46.42]I was ready.
[54:47.34]I was like, this is my favorite game ever.

[54:53.29]And he played it.
[54:54.33]And he did really good.
[54:55.59]And he didn't play it again.
[54:56.33]And I was like, bro.
[54:59.23]Where's Insane Aquarium?
[55:01.21]And he's playing all these other PopCap games.
[55:02.71]It's like, I want, I want to see a, he said he was going to do a full Insane Aquarium playthrough.
[55:07.68]I made that up, but I'm just pretending he said it to make myself feel better.

[55:15.54]That's how we feel.

[55:45.50]Welcome, everybody.
[55:48.20]Squeaks is a good lad.
[55:49.50]Squeaks is a good lad.
[55:50.20]You know, go follow Squeaks' stream.
[55:51.86]He's got a great stream.
[55:52.76]Seriously.
[55:53.08]But yeah, welcome, welcome.
[55:56.66]We're playing Fate.
[55:58.02]I'm just kind of chilling out, playing some Fate.
[56:01.44]It got remastered.
[56:07.60]And I never really played that much of the original, but I want to play a lot of the remastered.
[56:12.24]It seems like it's pretty good.
[56:14.30]So let's go.
[56:18.58]You need to finish sorcery.
[56:21.02]I don't think I've, yeah, every time I've said I'm going to finish, and the thing is, I don't think, Squeaks didn't even say he was going to like finish this.
[56:27.81]I went to, okay, you want some, here's some lore.
[56:31.15]I went to Squeaks' channel at like one o'clock in the morning one night.
[56:34.87]This is like a week ago.
[56:37.43]And I just wrote in the chat.
[56:39.31]I didn't know if anybody was going to be there.
[56:40.47]I just like, I'm in my like kind of write shit in streamers chats arc where I just kind of like, I'm like, oh, that might be fun.
[56:47.94]I wrote a bunch of shit in this chat at like one o'clock in the morning.
[56:50.46]And I was like, oh, maybe he'll, I don't think he'll see this.
[56:52.84]There were like 20, there were like 10 people there.
[56:54.99]And they're like, oh, wait, Jerma, what's up?
[56:56.49]What's going on?
[56:56.93]And I was like, oh, fuck, I didn't.
[56:57.93]Oh, there's people.
[56:59.11]There's a lot of people here.
[57:01.57]And I was like, yo, bro, when are you going to finish Insane Aquarium?
[57:04.37]Like, we're fucking waiting.
[57:05.79]Like, it's one o'clock in the morning.
[57:07.05]What do I think?
[57:07.43]He's live?
[57:08.91]I just like made myself laugh in Squeaks' chat for like five minutes.
[57:12.29]And I forgot that Squeaks is a popular streamer.
[57:14.69]So there's going to be people there.
[57:16.45]Alright, let's go.
[57:23.95]You enter the portal.
[57:31.42]The Squeaks Discord knows about your offline chat.
[57:37.53]Cool.
[57:41.71]You will encounter orbs.
[57:45.04]Alright, so what am I looking for here?
[57:48.16]Level 3.
[57:50.42]Uh... Is Sil Sen, the Fire Elemental.
[57:54.80]Look at how- look at this.
[57:56.12]I already know exactly what I gotta do.
[57:58.10]This is- what a great game, honest to fucking god.
[58:00.84]I don't need to learn anything, I don't need to read anything.
[58:02.81]It's just like, hey, there's a guy in level 3, get him.
[58:05.63]Okay.
[58:07.93]Oh, and by the way, you don't even- you don't need to navigate.
[58:09.75]Just go that- just go in the door.
[58:12.55]Just go in the door?
[58:13.51]Yeah.
[58:15.15]Oh, alright.
[58:19.23]Did he just destroy me?
[58:23.63]I got hurt a lot.
[58:24.41]Why?
[58:28.98]Oh, there he is.
[58:31.04]Fire against fire.
[58:31.84]I was trying to think of something funny to say.
[58:36.54]I got nothing funny to say.
[58:41.88]Kill him!
[58:45.10]He's got a lot of adds.
[58:48.10]Yeah, fire against fire is not going to work.
[58:59.45]He dropped something cool.
[59:03.93]Holy shit, do I have to give this back?
[59:06.64]What if I just don't show back up at town ever again?
[59:10.40]This thing is insane.
[59:14.03]Should I just not... I'm being dead serious to people that play this game.
[59:18.18]Should I just not give this back?
[59:24.42]Just cancel the quest.
[59:28.56]45 strength.
[59:29.24]Oh shit, that's right.
[59:31.64]This thing is disgusting.
[59:32.72]25 attack... I get 25 points in attack magic skill?
[59:43.85]I'm just saying, that's the single best item that's dropped in the 14 minutes I've played the game.
[59:52.50]Okay, cool.
[59:53.10]So then we gotta keep going down.
[59:55.42]You'll get better stuff by the time you can use it anyways?
[59:57.20]Okay, cool.
[60:04.17]Uh... Okay, what about crit again?
[60:11.79]This might be dumb, but...
[60:21.74]Is not putting points in decks stupid in this game?
[60:23.94]Is that a bad idea?
[60:35.47]Just do max vitality.
[60:36.95]Okay.
[60:43.57]Yeah.
[60:43.95]Okay.
[60:44.53]Also, can't I?
[60:45.33]Yeah, I can give the pet stuff and the pet will bring it back to town.
[60:56.50]Place items here for your pet to carry.
[60:57.80]You can also have your pet pick up items in the world.
[61:00.76]Your pet can also wear... I don't know why it said wigs.
[61:03.20]I was like, that's kind of cool.
[61:05.66]That's awesome.
[61:06.22]I would love to put a wig on.
[61:08.54]An earring and a necklace to improve its power.
[61:10.83]Ooh.
[61:12.99]Like a little mercenary?
[61:13.79]Like imagine a little Otto with like a wig.
[61:21.03]I don't know.
[61:21.51]It'd be like cute.
[61:26.59]So he's kind of like a little storage that hangs out.
[61:30.52]He doesn't steal it though, does he?
[61:39.56]Torchlight does the pet system as well.
[61:43.84]Yeah, I didn't play very much Torchlight.
[61:46.20]I did, but I didn't.
[61:50.66]Every time a new torchlight would come out, I'd play it for an hour and then I just wouldn't pick it up again.
[61:56.20]I don't know why.
[61:56.86]I really don't know why.
[61:57.72]I think at that point, I really was just such a Diablo II hipster that... Well, this is not Diablo II.
[62:07.44]I'm not playing it.
[62:08.20]I refuse.
[62:08.62]What's the way to go down?
[62:17.52]Oh, why would I play Torchlight 1 when I can just play Diablo II for a 15,000th time?
[62:22.47]Expand your horizons a little, you know?
[62:33.94]Uh, Torchlight... I think Ster was talking about Torchlight, the new one.
[62:37.78]He said it was pretty good.
[62:40.83]But there are a lot of torchlights now.
[62:41.97]There's like four or five of them.
[62:43.41]So what... It's kind of like, what's the good one?
[62:46.27]What's the one you really should play that's got the best systems, best gear, best loot, best enemies?
[62:53.19]The original or Torchlight 2?
[62:54.37]Torchlight 2 is really fun.
[63:04.35]Oh, here we go.
[63:04.75]There it is.
[63:05.01]Alright, what am I going to do here?
[63:18.06]cool alright I need uh I just gotta get to level five nothing off level four just gotta get through it alright the spell casting I've got you can't just I've got to line it up and then click fisherman
[63:50.46]I got a fishing pole.
[63:54.52]Dude, there are World of Warcraft fish buffs in this game.
[63:56.78]Are you kidding me?
[63:57.32]Hey, don't bully this dev into giving out keys again.
[64:08.91]That's you that you are misinterpreting something that happened on the stream.
[64:13.91]OK, you are taking a scenario and you're misinterpreting it and you're flipping it on me.
[64:29.94]I'm coming up on my first break here.
[64:33.76]Alright, I can stand back.
[64:35.48]I think the things actually can hurt me now.
[64:37.41]Okay, yeah, these guys hurt, so don't do it.
[64:48.35]And remember I told you yesterday, the day before, that where's the games with the guy that just kind of talks sometimes?
[64:54.53]Look out, there's poison in the vicinity.
[64:57.71]That just happened.
[65:03.29]Like, a pop-up screen didn't just come up and tell me everything about poison.
[65:06.21]I just heard a guy kind of go, Look out.
[65:08.13]It's poison.
[65:09.69]There's fire in this next room.
[65:12.31]Oh, be careful.
[65:14.11]I gotta fucking... I gotta make a game.
[65:16.41]I gotta make a game because, like, I'm imagining a guy does that.
[65:20.66]And, like, there's ice in the room and he got it wrong.
[65:22.70]And he's like, Oh, sorry.
[65:23.66]I fucked that up.
[65:24.60]There's ice in this one.
[65:27.42]Alright, I'm back.
[65:29.48]It pauses right here.
[65:34.33]Uh, back in like three or four minutes, it's going to scratch my legs, get up and there'll be some ads and they'll be coming any minute here.
[65:42.64]See you soon.
[70:20.31]How we doing?
[70:21.07]Just finishing up brewing a tea.
[70:23.64]I do have a story for you though when I get back.
[70:25.68]And I think if you were here yesterday, I think you'll like it.
[70:31.94]I'll be right back.
[72:16.63]Okay.
[72:17.03]So, uh, yeah, I had a, you were here yesterday.
[72:21.93]We talked about the traffic jam.
[72:25.15]Hey, there's a traffic jam kind of at the grocery store, the NPC line.
[72:31.54]Well, uh, it happened again this time.
[72:35.42]You got to listen to me though.
[72:38.62]So
[72:40.95]Same exact scenario happened today, but here's the difference.
[72:47.11]Usually it's you, for those of you that don't, that weren't here yesterday, let me briefly explain what I'm talking about.
[72:52.32]So you got the aisles at the grocery store, and then you've got the area around the aisles, and when you're coming out with the cart, it's sometimes you have to, coming out of one of the aisles, people, there's people coming back and forth, you have to be careful of, and everyone kind of waits, oh, what, oh shit, you don't want to bump into anybody.
[73:10.63]And I've been saying, when you bump into somebody, when you see somebody coming and you're coming out of an aisle, oh, traffic jam.
[73:18.25]Look at everybody.
[73:18.73]Traffic jam.
[73:19.39]And it just alleviates the situation.
[73:20.73]Everybody moves on with their day.
[73:22.75]It happened today.
[73:24.25]And I'll give you the scenario.
[73:25.41]So...
[73:28.32]It was, there were four or five carts.
[73:31.64]No, there were three carts in the same aisle.
[73:33.94]I was one of them.
[73:35.38]And there was somebody turning into the aisle, somebody trying to get out of the aisle behind me, and me to the left in the aisle.
[73:45.58]So it was, this was a scenario where it was, oh, three of us now are like, gosh, what do we do?
[73:52.90]Where do we go?
[73:53.92]What's the scenario here?
[73:56.18]And I had to say it.
[73:59.29]I had to say it.
[74:02.33]I held back, but this was a long one.
[74:04.63]This was like at least 10 straight seconds of we're trying to figure out where to go.
[74:09.35]So I had to do it.
[74:10.73]It was just like, oh no, you go that way.
[74:12.94]No, I'm going to stop and you go.
[74:15.54]Oh man, there's a traffic jam in here.
[74:17.78]I was like, fuck.
[74:19.86]But like, it was the perfect scenario for it.
[74:22.10]In fact, it was probably the only scenario for it.
[74:33.54]And I was sitting there for about nine straight seconds thinking to myself, I just told everybody on my stream yesterday that I was not going to do this anymore.
[74:44.10]But what else would you say in that scenario?
[74:46.44]What a perfect place to say that.
[75:01.15]You just can't resist.
[75:07.02]No, I can't.
[75:07.72]I actually can't.
[75:08.90]I really cannot.
[75:09.86]You're right.
[75:14.92]There's no regen naturally in this game, is there?
[75:24.25]I kind of like that.
[75:25.01]That's pretty cool.
[75:31.91]I did think about it.
[75:32.69]I did think for at least 5 to 10 straight seconds if it was... This is the scenario why I use that line.
[75:39.87]And I'm holding back?
[75:41.55]Nah.
[75:43.33]Nah, this is a... Wow, we got some traffic here.
[75:46.01]The traffic jam.
[75:57.10]But then I was thinking, what is a different line?
[76:00.59]Did they laugh?
[76:01.21]Oh yeah, it was like a... But what's a different line for that, right?
[76:06.23]And I've been trying to have a different line.
[76:08.77]But hey, look out, we're bunching up here.
[76:11.96]No, no, no, no.
[76:12.56]What else works besides that?
[76:18.16]That's very, it's not nothing weird about it.
[76:20.54]It's just like, you just say, excuse me.
[76:22.22]Attempt fate and read from the ancient text.
[76:26.77]Should I do this?
[76:29.94]Yeah, but that's what I do.
[76:31.10]I would be like, oh, excuse me.
[76:33.84]Must be rush hour.
[76:35.68]Yeah, that's a good one too.
[76:37.22]Maybe I'll use that next time.
[76:41.26]Oh.
[76:54.51]Oh, let me just sneak by.
[76:55.49]Yep, I used that one too though.
[76:58.79]And isn't it weird that you use the, oh, hey, let me just sneak by you line.
[77:02.61]Even if you're not even close to that person.
[77:06.53]You could be two or three full, three or four carts away from somebody and you'll probably still do it.
[77:12.91]Cause you just, I'm like walking towards you with this cart.
[77:16.44]I've got to give you the, hey, let me just sneak by you real quick.
[77:18.76]Even though I'm probably like six feet away from you.
[77:24.80]Spell wheel.
[77:29.99]Okay, and the spellbook menu... I think that was the rat, right?
[77:38.58]Nice.
[77:44.27]I say behind you whenever now because the food service industry taught me that.
[77:47.63]Wait, you hit people with the behind?
[77:51.27]No, you do a behind?
[77:59.67]If I'm going down the cereal aisle and somebody at the, you know, the honey bunches of votes and I'm gonna, I'm up behind.
[78:04.66]I feel like that for, no, I feel like, hey, traffic jam.
[78:10.40]Hey, traffic jam is behind is kind of implied urgency.
[78:15.90]Putting your hands up in the air, clapping once and going, hey, traffic.
[78:21.45]That's no implied urgency.
[78:22.97]Traffic is implied that you are stuck in it, by the way.
[78:27.25]Traffic is implied that you're going to be there for a minute or two.
[78:31.52]Behind implies I have this urgency here.
[78:34.30]Ew, you clap.
[78:38.66]Don't ew.
[78:39.34]I got an ew?
[78:40.58]Don't ew?
[78:41.10]What do you mean ew?
[78:44.13]No, I don't clap.
[78:44.99]I'm just saying you throw your hands up and just like, oh, whoops.
[78:48.01]No, I don't clap.
[78:48.89]Did I say I clap?
[78:52.06]I don't do this.
[78:58.54]Somebody just gave me an ew.
[79:11.89]I did say clap.
[79:13.42]Well, I don't clap.
[79:14.30]I don't know why I added that.
[79:18.16]I added it for a comedic effect for some reason.
[79:23.03]No, I don't clap.
[79:26.49]Hold on, I gotta... Actually, hold on.
[79:35.31]Can I hold a shield as a caster?
[79:43.95]This thing is a piece of shit.
[79:44.99]Why am I even holding this?
[79:48.98]Can I give... Can I give it to him?
[79:57.08]Otto has a single loop earring.
[80:06.83]Okay.
[80:17.08]That comedy was too tame.
[80:18.38]I'm going to unsubscribe.
[80:21.08]Uh.
[80:22.88]Hey, you are free with your subscription.
[80:25.56]Free to do whatever you want with it.
[80:30.75]There are probably 500,000 streamers on twitch.tv.
[80:35.89]You've got one subscription.
[80:39.35]Well, no you don't.
[80:40.07]You can have as many as you want, I guess, but... Do whatever you want with your money, okay?
[80:46.27]Just fucking be careful.
[80:47.41]Don't be crazy.
[80:54.98]Did he just do a pillar of fire at somebody?
[81:05.58]You only get one.
[81:06.56]I'm thinking of prime.
[81:08.06]That's what I'm thinking of.
[81:08.66]Because you only get one prime sub, right?
[81:15.74]Ooh, what's that?
[81:27.68]Jeremy, you think everyone at the grocery store is a peasant?
[81:37.24]No, I... What?
[81:39.88]The only thing that bothers me at the grocery store is when you got somebody that just stands looking at the butter for three to five minutes.
[82:00.66]Yeah, or if somebody just sneezes all over something.
[82:03.76]And you're just like, what the fuck, man?
[82:06.02]I might take that honey bunches of votes.
[82:21.85]Oh, and they block the milk door.
[82:24.92]That doesn't bother me that much because...
[82:28.57]Getting a milk from a grocery store is an individual task.
[82:31.70]It's not just a big open thing.
[82:33.04]At least a lot of them at the doors, right?
[82:35.22]So somebody has to open the door, awkwardly get their cart around, the door opens, they reach in.
[82:40.98]That's fine.
[82:41.64]That's fine.
[82:45.61]It's the guy like contemplating the Pythagorean theorem while looking at the like olive oil filled butters and stuff.
[83:07.95]Holy shit, I have way too much health.
[83:09.05]Those things don't do anything.
[83:09.89]I think I have to go back to town.
[83:21.64]You have completed the quest.
[83:24.18]Do you buy expensive olive oil?
[83:25.94]I love olive oil.
[83:27.96]The answer is yes.
[83:31.08]You feel healthy.
[83:32.48]You are refreshed.
[83:36.47]There's one thing I'll tell you to splurge on is to get a good olive oil.
[83:39.49]I feel like there's a boss or something coming up.
[83:45.93]Why would I get all this?
[83:54.54]Take a shot of olive oil on stream.
[83:55.92]If you act like that, that's like something weird I wouldn't do.
[84:04.53]Damn.
[84:10.48]Alright, I think I got it.
[84:11.18]I did everything, right?
[84:12.16]Yeah, alright, I can go back to town.
[84:17.21]Oh shit, I don't have any portals.
[84:18.37]I didn't buy any.
[84:19.41]What do I do about this?
[84:29.78]GG?
[84:30.12]I have to run all the way back?
[84:32.13]Oh no.
[84:43.44]A shot of olive oil would go right through you and give you these shits.
[84:45.46]That's why Starbucks stopped doing it.
[84:52.09]Oh, is that it?
[84:52.61]Is that why?
[85:00.61]Guys, I don't drink olive oil.
[85:02.65]I like olive oil with hummus and bread.
[85:04.94]I like it on a nice piece of salmon or a piece of chicken.
[85:11.90]I drizzle it on pizza and stuff.
[85:13.68]Okay, that thing is a big spider.
[85:14.94]I think I'm going to have to come back and kill that.
[85:23.50]Olive oil is so wonderful.
[85:26.94]Taste great.
[85:28.06]It's good for you too.
[85:28.78]It's got a lot of antioxidants.
[85:29.94]It's got a lot of good fats.
[85:34.60]You feel healthy.
[85:45.42]Olive oil and pizza.
[85:47.08]I would put olive oil on anything.
[85:50.62]Actually anything.
[86:00.49]I have to be careful here because I don't want to die.
[86:03.57]What happens when you die in this game?
[86:05.79]Is it like kind of like Minecraft where I lose everything?
[86:22.19]I need to get some new spells too.
[86:23.33]Where's this guy going?
[86:31.54]Whenever I wake up, you have some weird unplanned surprise stream.
[86:38.13]Hey, I'm just, hey, I'm just broadcasting.
[86:41.93]I'm a broadcaster now.
[86:45.96]It's just, they're just going to happen sometimes.
[86:47.54]I don't know.
[86:51.94]Olive oil and Parmesan to dip bread in.
[86:53.90]Absolutely.
[86:55.22]That's one of the greatest things in the world.
[87:00.82]Alright, what's the chance that a town portable actually drops so I don't have to run back?
[87:21.68]Are you going to play more WoW?
[87:22.52]Sorry, I'm a Warcraft Andy.
[87:24.16]No, that's alright.
[87:26.08]You're absolutely in your right to ask about it.
[87:28.54]Because I did start it and then I got to level 20 and didn't play it again.
[87:37.12]Oh, I got a point of dexterity for free.
[87:41.34]Nice.
[87:43.22]Um, yes, I do.
[87:45.24]Oh boy.
[87:46.22]I don't know if I want to fight this right now.
[87:47.32]Do I have any health?
[87:47.94]I don't have any healing potions.
[87:51.42]My pig just killed that.
[87:52.46]What am I so afraid of?
[87:58.44]The auto just killed that thing.
[88:09.08]But what you could report.
[88:11.30]I like to cutery.
[88:18.96]Except anytime there's a charcuterie board, I always am the guy that... I like the cheeses.
[88:25.02]I like the fig.
[88:27.42]And I like the... They do honey and fig and cheese and bread.
[88:32.93]I don't really love the salami.
[88:37.85]I like prosciutto, but I don't really love it, love it.
[88:41.29]So I'm the one that kind of picks up the cheeses and eats them with the nuts.
[88:58.34]I don't dislike prosciutto.
[88:59.66]I really have to be in the mood for it.
[89:02.23]And it has to be good prosciutto.
[89:04.85]I've had prosciutto before that many times that was just... Oh, this is dog shit.
[89:11.05]It's just chewy and... It has to be a really good, tender, delicious prosciutto.
[89:19.50]Otherwise, I don't really want it.
[89:23.99]Yeah, shitty- shitty prosciutto makes you not, like, want to eat prosciutto again.
[89:28.75]That's how bad bad prosciutto is.
[89:31.18]Bad pizza is fine because it's still pizza.
[89:33.56]Bad prosciutto makes you rethink ordering it ever again.
[89:43.34]I got a lot of stuff to sell.
[89:45.20]I need to go back to town.
[89:53.47]Why does this require magic?
[89:54.95]It doesn't really do anything.
[90:03.58]Your pronunciation of prosciutto is making me go feral.
[90:09.66]Okay.
[90:13.01]What do you want?
[90:14.27]Prosciutto.
[90:15.15]What do you want me to say?
[90:17.51]Phonetically spell it out in the chat.
[90:18.63]What do you want me to say?
[90:26.09]Pro-shu-too.
[90:28.93]Pro-shu-to.
[90:31.14]Pro-su-to.
[90:33.00]Pro-shu-to.
[90:35.44]Pro-shu-to.
[90:36.56]That's what I'm saying.
[90:38.66]Pro-shu-to.
[90:41.80]How are you saying it?
[90:43.68]Pro-shu-to.
[90:44.22]I'm saying it faster, Cap.
[90:51.37]That little fucker just almost killed me.
[90:54.43]Why are they all resistant to fire?
[91:03.02]shit I gotta go back to town maybe I should just run back the two needs to be more progressive prosciutto uh I have to run back this sucks unless it can somebody stop me from doing this and you tell me hey you don't have to do that I forgot to get a town portal
[91:37.09]Why are you saying it like Mario?
[91:43.23]Feeding fish to your pet can change into other creatures.
[91:47.61]Really?
[91:47.87]I can fish.
[91:55.25]I have a fishing pole, right?
[91:57.41]Wait for a bite and reel in.
[92:13.80]Um, hello?
[92:20.63]Fuck out of here.
[92:21.35]There's a slug coming after me.
[92:29.27]What does it look like?
[92:30.61]Like that?
[92:30.95]The little bubbles?
[92:32.97]Or no, would it be really, it'd be very, very obvious.
[92:36.77]I gotta take a sip of my tea.
[92:37.71]I just made it.
[92:44.77]tried I'm trying a new one today it's the turmeric one oh and it stinks that's how you know it's gonna be good your pack is full what did I pick up you cannot carry anymore um can I can I have can auto go buy stuff at the store
[93:15.99]That'd be so awesome.
[93:18.55]Like, if Otto could go get me, like, a bag of Doritos.
[93:22.71]How would he... How much did Otto could drive?
[93:24.52]Give him $20 and a treat.
[93:25.16]All it would take is a treat.
[93:49.82]Dev said if the game is popular, then they'll add content to it and stuff.
[93:56.11]I mean, this is nice.
[93:57.57]This is a really comfy game.
[93:58.67]This is exactly what I was looking for.
[94:01.33]Damn, this is kind of good.
[94:14.06]Yeah, can I ascend and buy portals or no?
[94:33.76]Did I miss my opportunity or does it just take a while?
[94:48.07]Wait for the exclamation point.
[94:49.35]Okay.
[94:50.23]Does it appear over my head or appear over the water?
[95:02.49]Cool.
[95:20.58]you seem like the kind of guy that would take you uh with you with auto with you driving
[95:26.05]Um, I mean, sometimes, I mean, it's nice to take him on a little trip sometimes.
[95:32.15]He doesn't really love the car though.
[95:34.61]He gets kind of nervous.
[95:35.49]So I don't, I don't like to be like, let's go.
[95:38.37]We're going to do this.
[95:38.87]We're going to come with us this way.
[95:39.79]Come with this way.
[95:41.29]Um, like it kind of stresses him out.
[95:42.72]So.
[95:46.90]But if there's something fun to do at the end of that car ride, then yeah.
[95:50.64]Alright, fishing poles, uh... Fisheries take a lot of fireflies.
[95:54.47]Feeding fish to your pet transforms into a more powerful creature.
[95:59.55]You can find rare items too.
[96:03.53]What is that?
[96:05.23]What was that?
[96:05.69]What did I even get?
[96:06.21]A Lunker?
[96:16.02]Transforms your pet into a voltaic snail.
[96:25.96]Cool.
[96:26.20]There's probably some meta with doing that, right?
[96:34.44]Snail kind of sucks.
[96:37.32]I didn't get it.
[96:38.16]I looked away for a second.
[96:52.24]Hey, a Lunker means a big fish in the fishing world.
[96:55.11]Oh yeah.
[97:00.71]Flawless, what was it?
[97:07.56]Into a snow stalker.
[97:10.16]Permanently.
[97:14.72]Permanently?
[97:17.78]That's massive.
[97:18.54]Wait, is this good?
[97:20.15]This is like crazy good, I guess.
[97:25.02]Man, look at all these pogs in the chat.
[97:26.50]Whoa!
[97:30.06]Should I do that right now?
[97:31.30]You can undo it, but maybe I'll hold on to it.
[97:33.36]I'm not going to do it just yet.
[97:41.31]You are high right now.
[97:43.13]No, I am not.
[97:47.15]I know you might think that.
[97:49.66]because it's a late night stream.
[97:52.44]I got a tea in my hand and I'm playing Fate.
[97:56.80]I can assure you.
[97:59.34]Answer is no.
[97:59.80]You're going to miss the eclipse.
[98:10.62]Can I even see it from Vegas?
[98:11.94]Is it viewable from Nevada?
[98:27.32]When it was first said in your chat, did you know what Pog was?
[98:32.30]I've been around since PogChamp's inception.
[98:46.91]Is Pog... Okay, hold on.
[98:48.05]Is the original PogChamp like if I were to go back and watch Gremlins 2?
[98:55.34]Do you know what I mean when I say that?
[98:57.54]Like, is that your 90s content?
[99:00.67]Like, it's been like 10 years almost, right?
[99:03.57]Do you think back on the original PogChamp or some of these emotes or some stuff on Twitch?
[99:07.51]And is that like kind of the 80s or the 90s on the internet?
[99:13.05]I think no, I think that's it's a little bit further back.
[99:20.67]Like the way that I see the 90s, do you see like the original PogChamp?
[99:31.40]10 years?
[99:31.64]I mean, it's 10 years.
[99:34.88]Or like the early 2000s.
[99:38.24]OG rage memes, maybe.
[99:40.12]Yeah, that's true.
[99:42.42]We're not 12.
[99:43.00]Yeah, but that's because you would have been 2.
[99:53.39]Your chat leans on the younger side.
[99:55.72]You know, I actually, that's not even necessarily true.
[99:59.92]I think a lot of younger people have joined this channel and community over the last few years.
[100:06.64]But I just got recent demographics.
[100:09.75]It's like, I think 50 to 60% of the people here are 18 to 24.
[100:13.75]No, no, no, sorry, 24 to 35.
[100:14.29]It's like 40 to 50% of the whole audience is 25 to 34.
[100:24.70]I mean, you could've just lied, but I mean, that would be a lot of liars then.
[100:28.30]Alright, one more.
[100:31.51]It's a lot of 25 year olds, I think.
[100:40.77]25 to 30.
[101:00.83]It's crazy because this community has, because it's been around for so long, there are a lot of people that are, oh shit, I didn't do it.
[101:11.40]I think that's the nature of having, you know, how long I've been doing this for.
[101:16.78]Failed.
[101:19.51]That some of you that were 15, 16, 17, 10 to 15 years ago are now in your late 20s, into your early 30s.
[101:32.71]And then there's a lot of people that just kind of stumbled upon this channel in the last few years.
[101:41.33]It's a very broad range of people that have been watching this stream and the YouTube stuff specifically from that long ago.
[101:57.73]I'm almost 30 and I still watch YouTube poops.
[102:01.23]There's nothing wrong with that.
[102:04.43]Some of the hardest I've ever laughed in my entire life was at a YouTube poop.
[102:10.53]That's serious.
[102:20.92]And I mean genuine my stomach hurts from laughing at this because it's so fucking stupid.
[102:35.58]And this is back before AI.
[102:37.02]This is back when you couldn't just type in, hey, I want you to have Hank Hill say, uh, damn it, Bobby.
[102:49.38]You know what I mean though, right?
[102:50.94]Like you had to go find, if you wanted Hank Hill to say, I love pizza and I want it in my, I'm not going to even say it.
[103:02.08]Okay, so you two poops were crazy.
[103:06.00]But you had to go find every phonetic part of...
[103:13.40]You had to find, if you wanted Hank Hill to say, I love pizza.
[103:17.68]If he didn't say that in an episode, you had to find an episode where he said, I. Then a place where he said, love.
[103:26.54]And then if he didn't ever say the word pizza in the entire run of the show, he may have said pie.
[103:32.41]So you took the pie.
[103:34.78]And then maybe he said, oh, maybe Bobby, you need to go get some Z's.
[103:39.25]Get some sleep.
[103:40.47]So you take the Z and you cut that out.
[103:42.79]So it was... And then at some point he screamed in an episode and was like... So you would cut that from like, whatever, episode 40.
[103:52.50]And it was Bobby...
[103:58.13]And that's how we did it back in the day.
[104:00.01]You had to go find this shit.
[104:02.85]It was difficult.
[104:04.43]It was art.
[104:05.47]It was an art form.
[104:13.22]I just got a spell.
[104:18.02]Ooh.
[104:21.16]Charm magic?
[104:25.34]Okay, so F2, I'm assuming that puts it on here, right?
[104:30.12]Summons three level three ruby crystal crabs.
[104:33.14]Ooh.
[104:35.69]Okay, I would have to put points in charm.
[104:44.59]The best green screen movie night videos were all basically just YouTube poops.
[104:47.67]It was kind of magical.
[104:48.53]Yeah, that's true.
[104:51.49]And that's kind of the intent with doing that.
[104:54.16]Was...
[104:57.06]It was so fun to watch people take all that stuff out of context and make other things with it.
[105:04.79]And be put in scenarios where you have to use your imagination a little.
[105:08.43]It was great.
[105:13.85]The Star Wars clips?
[105:16.18]Yeah, just watching people try to find ways to make it work.
[105:22.78]And eventually there were, eventually almost 18 hours of green screen footage.
[105:26.56]So there was a lot of times where I may have said, hey, or donuts, or hey, turn left there.
[105:34.69]Doing something and you just kind of had to find a way to use it.
[105:41.59]Okay, so that's cool.
[105:42.45]I got... Hold control and left click to permanently remove a spell.
[105:49.83]So if I go like that, oh...
[105:54.72]Cool.
[105:57.42]So how long do they, do they last a long time?
[105:59.87]I guess I could read it.
[106:07.55]I do need to run back to town though.
[106:09.45]I'm just going to run.
[106:13.69]I don't want to aggro anything else.
[106:20.74]Would you ever do that again?
[106:24.66]You know... I don't think so.
[106:29.69]I really don't think so.
[106:31.11]Because the third one really was... Kind of the tail end of... A lot of the... Let's call them performance-based streaming.
[106:43.25]And the three of them were so good and they were so perfect in my mind.
[106:47.91]Going back and doing it again... Almost... I don't want to do the...
[106:54.20]You know, in some of the later Pirates of the Caribbean movies... I think I've brought this up before, but you kind of get to that point where it's like... It's like sometimes it feels like the actor is doing an impression of themself.
[107:07.55]It's like, oh, that's Johnny Depp doing... That's Johnny Depp doing an impression of Johnny Depp, kind of.
[107:15.55]Like, even sometimes, like, I think Will Ferrell is one of the most hysterical comedians ever.
[107:19.61]Like, in some of the SNL heyday stuff, some of the most brilliant fucking characters in some of the... He's hysterically funny.
[107:26.89]I thought Will was, uh... My buddy, Will.
[107:31.00]Um... But sometimes it gets to the point where you see them do the schtick so much that it kind of turns into, like, a... They're doing, like, almost like a parody of themselves.
[107:45.86]And I think if we did another one... I feel like at some of those, I would be trying to do some of the jokes, and it might just kind of feel like I'm... Like, hey, remember when this was funny?
[107:55.82]And... Like reprising a role, yeah.
[108:08.75]And I think I like where they are.
[108:10.91]I think they sit in a great place in my brain and I think that they were a lot of fun.
[108:14.99]And like still reaching for that again.
[108:17.03]Whoa.
[108:21.21]I had things I wanted to do in front of the screen.
[108:24.61]All three of those times.
[108:26.83]And doing it a fourth time is... Now I'm trying to figure out what to do in front of that screen.
[108:33.64]It's not naturally happening anymore.
[108:47.63]And what was it?
[108:48.15]I mean, Seinfeld famously stopped kind of their show.
[108:55.56]Like, you know, Larry David and obviously Jerry Seinfeld and everybody was, it's kind of in its heyday.
[109:01.92]And well, why didn't you, oh, we could have just done more Seinfeld.
[109:05.01]It's like, yeah, you could have, but would it have been as fun?
[109:08.47]Would you have remembered it as fondly as a lot of you maybe do now?
[109:12.87]I gotta get out of here.
[109:15.93]so a fourth green screen would almost feel like a show that should have ended when it did and now we're doing it again and maybe what if it's not as funny as the other times what if it's not as fun for like for me to do as the other bro thinks he's Larry David god no I don't I'm just using it as an example oh I don't
[109:49.54]I'm going to die.
[109:50.54]You guys are fucking with me.
[109:59.48]Where's the exit?
[110:00.28]How come I can't find this?
[110:05.18]It's just the nature of... It's just using examples for the nature of ending something when you think it's time to end it.
[110:14.97]That's all I mean.
[110:24.61]I was going the right way before.
[110:25.65]Yeah, I was talking though.
[110:34.19]Wait, is it?
[110:35.15]Is it randomly generated if you go back up?
[110:45.78]Oh shit, that's why.
[110:47.22]Uh oh.
[110:50.12]I might be dead here.
[110:52.45]I have to play very carefully, actually.
[110:58.10]Stop fucking opening barrels and eating poison!
[111:07.56]No, don't touch that!
[111:08.56]It's so enticing, I need to click it.
[111:15.19]I have to get out.
[111:15.91]I have so much stuff.
[111:20.48]Wow.
[111:21.42]Nice.
[111:22.83]That was... I may as well not have even had that potion.
[111:29.74]Hold on.
[111:30.38]Otto, I need to give you more stuff.
[111:33.78]Wait, can I eat the fish?
[111:47.68]So what you're saying is if you ever had that idea for what you wanted to do, you might do it.
[111:53.38]Yeah.
[111:53.72]Oh, yeah.
[112:00.92]You'll never hear me say that I'm never going to do something.
[112:03.58]I mean, maybe if a game I didn't really want to play or
[112:10.29]But I kind of don't want to ever say I'm... Oh my god.
[112:15.13]I am so ridiculous.
[112:22.26]I wasn't so ridiculous.
[112:23.92]I wouldn't click things I wasn't supposed to fucking click.
[112:31.47]Please write a story.
[112:32.57]I was actually thinking about it.
[112:38.75]Even if it sucked absolute balls, I was just thinking about doing it for fun.
[112:57.29]I gotta get this heartbeat off.
[113:02.51]Speaking of the green screen stream, wasn't there a period where I was... My heart rate was going crazy and you guys could hear it?
[113:10.62]Because I had that thing on my uh... The microphone on my chest.
[113:24.24]Enchanting.
[113:26.88]Cool.
[113:28.94]Alright, I'm gonna die.
[113:33.29]Thankfully, things are getting easier, not harder.
[113:35.17]Your mana is low.
[113:45.83]I just cut him off.
[113:48.59]Dude, don't crash out again.
[113:53.73]You have triggered a trap.
[113:57.86]I'm not going to crash out again.
[113:59.14]What are you talking about?
[114:24.75]Hey, level up nice.
[114:27.20]OK, I'm good.
[114:30.06]OK, charm skill.
[114:33.36]Nah.
[114:35.98]I want to be attack damage all the way.
[114:37.58]Get that to 40 and then maybe should I put points in decks?
[114:48.39]I feel like I'm going to get hit a lot.
[115:01.94]How do I clear?
[115:02.76]Oh, I see.
[115:20.86]What about more movie nights?
[115:22.92]Yeah, public domain movie nights for sure.
[115:24.56]I just got to find some of them that are, you know, worth putting on here.
[115:33.19]Hold on a second.
[115:39.21]I'd like to do ones that a lot of people haven't seen before.
[115:42.90]There's a lot of one, there's plenty of movies that have, thousands of people have seen them.
[115:47.22]They've been broken down, torn apart a thousand times.
[115:51.88]And I want to try to find a little more obscure movies.
[116:12.74]Rewatch Manos?
[116:16.08]No, I got... We got everything we wanted out of that one, I think.
[116:21.62]Lawless Dory?
[116:45.69]salamander permanent salamander I'm gonna say I probably should have the pet be defense strength and defense judging by it's uh the fact that I'm doing magic
[117:17.45]Flawless fish are the rarest ones, by the way.
[117:19.31]Cool.
[117:21.65]I need to hoard them forever.
[117:29.37]Talked about performing in the past.
[117:30.83]Is that something you wouldn't want to do going forward?
[117:33.83]No, I don't think so.
[117:35.05]I think it's just for the most part.
[117:36.96]If there's something that I think is interesting to do, then I'll do it.
[117:54.59]Disk spell.
[117:56.86]Energy disk fly straight.
[118:01.44]2 to 7.
[118:09.70]What is the fireball?
[118:14.94]Fireball is so much more damage we should.
[118:23.84]It's just a lot of those streams, they can get very expensive and... A lot of traveling and coordinating.
[118:35.18]And over the last couple of years, I definitely have wanted to slow down a lot more and...
[118:50.11]I'm not against doing stuff like that anymore.
[118:51.75]It's just a question of does the right thing get in my brain?
[118:55.86]Then I'm like, I have to do this.
[118:57.54]And there are a few things.
[118:58.46]I actually have things that I have fully written down.
[119:01.24]I have.
[119:04.27]two or three major, major, what is it called, productions that are just permanently... I just have them.
[119:12.24]They're just there.
[119:13.86]And they're pretty much done.
[119:15.02]They just need to be made.
[119:17.08]But making them is the hard part, especially with one or two of them.
[119:21.98]There we go.
[119:28.97]And people talk about, like, oh, did you burn out?
[119:30.71]Did you... What...
[119:33.32]What caused you to want to kind of like get out of here for a little while or even permanently?
[119:38.54]I think the answer is yes.
[119:39.82]I think the answer is I kind of over the years maybe bit off a lot more than I probably could chew and needed a lot more money and resources that I really wasn't kind of getting and wasn't like had access to.
[119:54.69]And I always kind of was more of a
[120:03.67]Like, believe this or not, believe it or not, I actually... Have I said this before?
[120:11.90]That I'm a very introverted extrovert.
[120:15.86]The time has to be right and everything has to kind of click perfectly for me to want to really be extroverted.
[120:24.19]What we're doing right now, you could call this being an extrovert.
[120:26.89]There's no cam on right now.
[120:33.35]And I kind of turned that off.
[120:36.63]That's kind of like off now.
[120:42.52]Yeah, and like everyone else on Tinder.
[120:44.36]Wait, do people on Tinder say that shit?
[120:47.76]Did I just take a line from Tinder?
[120:49.40]No, no, no, no.
[120:51.07]Please don't tell me I just did that.
[120:54.73]You just did a, I'm not like the other girls.
[120:57.33]No, no, I just said I'm an introverted extrovert.
[121:06.38]You just said that to 11,000 people.
[121:08.34]I said, what's wrong with saying that you're an introverted extrovert?
[121:12.78]That means that I like my fucking alone time, but I like my fucking out time too.
[121:18.19]That's not, I, by the way, I'm not flirting with you right now, okay?
[121:35.50]You see, I'm an extroverted introvert.
[121:38.35]Fuck!
[121:40.85]No, and then I would have an emoji with my sign right next to it.
[121:44.79]Just delete the last 10 minutes of this stream.
[122:02.33]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[122:03.39]Here's where it would be.
[122:04.45]Okay.
[122:04.75]This is where I would agree with you.
[122:06.97]If I said, I'm the most extroverted introvert you'll ever meet.
[122:11.97]Then my emoji of, you know, Virgo.
[122:16.34]Then, okay.
[122:16.96]Now, now you can criticize that.
[122:19.84]That's not what I said.
[122:32.03]I don't want to buy anything.
[122:32.79]Alright, I'm back to town.
[122:33.93]I got Questa turned in too.
[122:35.09]I got a lot of shit to turn in.
[122:40.84]The damage has already been done.
[122:44.36]That's fine, whatever.
[122:46.00]Wait, how do I get up there?
[122:59.73]All the way around?
[123:11.98]Did I miss a place to go?
[123:13.08]Trying to get over here.
[123:25.43]Have I got a deal for you?
[123:29.19]Oh book of identify.
[123:30.21]I definitely want one of these.
[123:33.79]How many are in OK 10?
[123:34.55]Do you have a book of portals?
[123:42.76]I'm the most introverted extrovert you'll ever meet.
[123:46.66]Fuck.
[123:49.67]You know what I'm saying when I say that though, right?
[123:51.51]I kind of like to do something extroverted and then I just sit in my fucking room for like four or five straight days.
[124:04.89]Here, would it be better if I said, my social battery needs a week to charge?
[124:10.89]Is that better?
[124:11.37]And then Virgo and then Libra next to it, is that okay?
[124:15.89]Do I have, am I getting, can I do that?
[124:28.34]That's just being lazy.
[124:33.49]No, it's not.
[124:34.23]That's just... I'm an extremely extroverted introvert that requires a battery charge of one week after I do any... Okay, how many more signs do I have to put up?
[124:54.10]No, no, no.
[124:54.54]Okay, then add after that.

[132:31.65]I banned that person for an hour, honestly.
[132:34.46]You're gonna talk about Jiminy Glick like that?
[132:37.26]That person deserves a one hour ban.
[132:44.26]That is a full 60 minutes.
[132:45.61]Hey, take your ban and go watch a few episodes of Jiminy Glick and then you can come back and talk about it.

[134:14.49]And he puts his hand over to like the left side of the screen.
[134:17.33]His finger is up and he stops and he gets kind of scared.
[134:21.29]And Conan goes, you alright?
[134:24.08]And he's like, oh, yeah, sorry.

[134:29.12]He's talking about his own finger.
[134:31.54]Like he put his finger up in his peripheral in his own finger.
[134:34.26]He thought was like somebody coming into his peripheral to like hurt him.

[148:18.61]I mean, this reawakened it did.
[148:19.83]Alright, we gotta get to level 9.
[148:28.20]Is level 40 the end of the game or is that just kind of like act 1?

[148:51.12]Yeah.
[148:52.38]So this is a remastering of the first, the original one.
[148:58.30]So yes, this came out recently, but the original one's 25 years old.
[149:15.02]You used to be able just to download this for free from a sketchy site by just typing it into Google.
[149:30.72]Yeah, from some sketchy site, yeah.
[149:38.20]That's just total Wild West.

[151:17.48]What do we got here?
[151:20.02]Ooh, this is tight.
[151:20.86]I'd say if you're not asleep right now, you could affect the outcome.
[151:28.71]But you might be asleep.
[151:37.23]This is too close to call.
[151:51.86]Just mess with their dreams?
[151:52.98]No, no, I don't want to do that.
[151:55.29]I've done that before and I felt bad about it.
[152:02.53]Well, there it is.

[152:27.51]And it's permanent.
[152:28.65]Okay.
[152:42.82]Should I try the other spell?
[152:43.78]Oh, I guess I could do this as well.
[152:46.58]I have a bunch of friend.
[152:48.14]I have an antidote, don't I?
[152:56.67]Yep.
[153:09.58]Any notable dreams lately?
[153:11.01]No, not since the orb.
[153:12.49]That was just a weird one.
[153:13.57]Oh, shit.
[153:40.49]The what?
[153:44.51]Uh, I had a dream about a floating orange orb that was washing me sleep.
[153:50.20]It was pretty weird.
[154:05.44]Tell him to ban.
[154:06.31]Tell him he should ban me for a year because I, wait, did you say you didn't like Jiminy Glick?
[154:19.45]Ooh.
[154:24.45]5% magic fine?
[154:25.07]Cool.
[154:30.13]Where is this?
[154:30.57]I need to go to level 9.
[154:35.54]Leveling.
[154:36.66]Just leveling up.
[154:43.10]You gonna do Arx Vitalis tomorrow?
[154:47.64]Maybe.
[154:48.58]Maybe.
[154:50.67]I have not admittedly.
[154:51.67]I've not gotten the.
[154:55.01]Mod everything set up yet.
[154:56.05]It's a money room.
[154:59.53]I'll take the money room.
[155:05.55]On the chest.
[155:06.89]Oh fine.
[155:22.05]You should play Chaser.
[155:23.50]No, I would want to start Arx Vitalis before I go back to Chaser.
[155:41.61]You ever laid an egg?
[155:43.75]Um... Nah.
[155:54.23]I still have all the Freddy fishes.
[156:01.31]Which one was on the stream?
[156:02.45]Which one did I play on stream?
[156:04.39]Freddy fish two or three?
[156:18.71]I'm so glad I have portals now.
[156:27.16]It was one and two.
[156:28.11]Let's do this.
[156:40.46]Maybe we should do cast speed.
[156:47.26]Yeah.
[156:57.65]That stream was two years ago.
[156:59.62]The last two or three years went by so quickly.
[157:03.76]And not in a good way either, in kind of a bad way.
[157:05.92]Shit.
[157:31.86]Yeah, Lunar Eclipse, maybe we can see it.
[157:36.44]On the next break, I'll go see if we can see it.
[157:44.13]I just showed my mom the onion ring clip and she said that's how I feel when I get an onion ring in my fries too.
[157:49.25]W mom.
[157:52.34]You have triggered a trap.
[158:04.72]Alright, now it's going to start to get hard again because I'm back to where I should be.
[158:23.40]Being 40 and saying W mom does not help you.
[158:50.85]Would you guys want me to do a Hollow Knight playthrough?
[158:54.31]And do it for real and not give up on it 10 hours into it?
[158:58.13]Alright, do you promise to backseat the entire game?
[159:11.29]And do you also promise to get angry with me when I don't pick your favorite amulet or your favorite thing to use?
[159:19.38]Do you also promise to tell me how many times it took for you to beat this boss and how embarrassing it is for you to see me take a little longer than you?
[159:30.91]Are you also prepared for me to first try the hardest boss for you in the game and for you to smash your keyboard across your knees because you can't believe it?
[159:43.33]Then okay, I'll consider it.
[159:58.42]He's hitting for so hard.
[159:59.60]Holy shit.
[160:00.16]Okay.
[160:03.03]Actually, I've been playing with one hand.
[160:05.62]I just took enough damage where I have to actually pay attention now.
[160:26.90]Don't don't admit that don't admit what that I'm playing the game with one hand.
[160:30.49]Your pet has grown more skewed.
[160:39.66]Oh shit, OK, things are starting to hurt.
[160:45.50]Have I got a deal for you?
[160:50.27]Stunk.
[160:53.75]This thing... Okay, if it has unique artwork, it's probably crazy.
[160:57.47]Three sockets.
[161:07.08]Charm.
[161:07.80]Charm.
[161:09.62]Defense.
[161:10.82]Group drain.
[161:11.62]Is this just an AoE?
[161:12.20]Frailty.
[161:19.55]Frailty.
[161:23.60]That's kind of good.
[161:24.16]It's like the curses from Diablo.
[161:31.67]Somebody just said, holy shit, I've played something similar to this.
[161:34.93]Are you sure that it isn't this?
[161:39.35]It very well could be this.
[161:43.43]This is the remade or remastered whatever version of the old game.
[161:48.33]It could also be Torchlight, that's right.
[161:58.39]Alright, where are the quests?
[162:00.90]All on level nine.
[162:01.84]Damn, okay.
[162:19.10]Dude, where's spell click Sunday?
[162:20.88]I miss it.
[162:35.98]Can you hold a shield?
[162:36.96]I actually might be.
[162:37.74]Maybe I can.
[162:38.20]Alright, we got a new area.
[162:56.55]I feel like every single urn is cursed.
[163:18.82]You have to watch Tron if you see this.
[163:23.17]Do you guys have any required reading from me?
[163:24.83]I feel like I give you guys the required reading, but do you have any collectively for me?
[163:36.31]It used to be Jojo's Bizarre Adventure.
[163:37.87]That's right.
[163:38.49]It was Jojo for a long time, but it seems like the community's moved on from that.
[163:44.89]Help me.
[163:45.17]I can't hurt this guy.
[163:52.21]100% fire resistance.
[163:55.69]Can they not kill?
[163:56.57]They can't hurt this thing?
[163:58.98]Who just did that?
[163:59.82]Somebody just pinched him in the foot and killed him.
[164:03.42]He resisted everything.
[164:08.82]Severance.
[164:13.13]Severance is required reading from Allah.
[164:15.27]Hold on.
[164:21.11]If I can hit it, I'll kill it.
[164:27.68]Yeah, Severance is required reading for a lot of people right now.
[164:31.80]I mean you guys specifically.
[164:49.88]I feel like it needs some AoE.
[164:55.36]Will you do our homework?
[164:56.56]Yeah, I will.
[164:59.36]Not immediately, but I will.
[165:14.87]Ooh, defense.
[165:15.53]That's it.
[165:18.38]Ooh, maybe I'll just use this.
[165:20.73]Don't have a socket.
[165:24.01]I think it's in the inventory.
[165:31.97]Nobody told me I could have more than three crabs.
[165:35.79]You know, wait, I could have six crabs.
[165:37.77]Maybe I should have looked right there.
[165:47.99]Maybe summoning is fun to do.
[165:57.48]that I'm gonna die nice again every single one of these is trapped magic anvil will you tempt fate
[166:24.82]What?
[166:26.08]Place an item on the magic anvil.
[166:30.03]Should I do with this gold ring?
[166:50.68]What?
[166:52.26]What do you mean already used?
[167:02.54]An achievement for doing that, yeah.
[167:07.03]Mana drain?
[167:07.49]That's not good.
[167:27.28]I might put some points into charm.
[167:31.78]But don't get spread out too thin, right?
[167:37.95]Where's Otto?
[167:38.67]Otto is right next to me.
[167:45.73]He's laying down.
[167:46.63]He's touching my body right now.
[167:49.36]His butt is right next to me.
[167:59.61]I got heal.
[168:02.94]Thank goodness.
[168:04.34]No more potion bullshit.
[168:07.40]New spell has been learned.
[168:13.95]We get an auto cam.
[168:16.17]Uh, my camps not set up right now.
[168:18.41]I would do that one day though.
[168:20.11]Just give you a little.
[168:21.63]Watch him kind of snooze over here.
[168:42.94]Maybe I should put these on.
[168:45.34]I'm watching a Ban That Guy compilation and reading analog clocks are my go-to things to do while off my rocker.
[169:10.25]Wait, you mean you take an edible and just try to read a clock?
[169:23.20]It's kind of... You don't put on like Spongebob?
[169:27.76]You sit there and read clocks?
[169:32.34]You don't put on like the fairly odd parents intro theme and just jive wicked bad with it?
[170:10.55]Sing the whole song.
[170:17.26]Vibe.
[170:18.12]Vibe with it.
[170:24.24]You could do it.
[170:24.78]I don't know if I could do the whole thing.
[170:44.39]This is all seven.
[170:51.12]Are you the guy that keeps punching his balls?
[170:57.30]Yeah, that's me.
[171:08.49]Oh, I want to bind this.
[171:26.32]Give me this.
[171:31.78]Plus 235 strength.
[171:34.58]Oh, it's only for two minutes.
[171:35.78]Okay.
[171:35.96]I was going to say, holy shit.
[171:40.54]That's like a level 50.
[171:49.49]f4 okay so how does it work is it heal over time so
[172:17.56]I like watching you make noises.
[172:21.08]I have made a lot over the years.
[172:32.95]You feel healthy.
[172:44.01]You have sprung the trap.
[172:54.49]What about Kingdom Come Deliverance?
[172:56.70]Okay, is Kingdom Come Deliverance a 150 hour long experience?
[173:03.98]I feel like it probably is.
[173:04.86]Alright, I gotta be careful here.
[173:28.61]Everything I need to do is down here.
[173:29.83]Tunnel crawlers and a couple of bosses.
[173:39.60]Got it.
[173:40.02]Okay.
[173:59.27]What is that?
[174:03.79]I love rooms like this.
[174:06.61]Stuff everywhere.
[174:10.82]Assassin blade.
[174:17.20]Alright, 5% damage or.
[174:18.50]15% attack that that's probably more that that is more.
[174:40.51]Getting the extra money seems pretty good though.
[174:43.33]Oh, hold on.
[174:43.89]Yeah.
[174:48.80]Oh shit.
[175:20.09]I can fish.
[175:50.62]Summon vampire?
[175:56.71]Level 10 vampire bats.
[175:58.25]What are the things I'm doing right now?
[176:02.49]Level 9.
[176:04.58]Oh, shit.
[176:05.00]Oh, that's the guy I gotta kill.
[176:05.82]Alright, I got him.
[176:08.24]He's dead.
[176:24.12]Kill it!
[176:31.66]Level 9?
[176:32.30]Haha, good one, man.
[176:46.92]Oh, there's still... Devil Reaper the Ruthless?
[176:54.11]And then there's two more tunnel crawlers I gotta kill.
[176:57.93]I'm gonna get some other spells besides fire.
[177:19.59]I feel like everything is resistant to it.
[177:34.57]The staff, I think it's good.
[177:46.76]What about your lizard?
[177:50.92]Oh my god, I didn't, I have to heal the lizard.
[178:04.38]Okay, I gave him a bunch of potions.
[178:05.56]He should be fine.
[178:22.90]More fire.
[178:34.58]Do you eat dog food if it was really good?
[178:41.44]Uhm, no.
[178:43.56]There's a reason why it says dog food on the can.
[178:46.31]No way.
[178:51.59]It doesn't say dog and or person food.
[179:08.42]Okay, but what if it did?
[179:09.26]Okay, if it did, then yeah.
[179:13.24]If there was a can of food that said, like, it buries meat paste.
[179:19.59]And on the side, it was for dog or human consumption.
[179:25.71]I would... Okay, what are the ingredients?
[179:27.81]Are they high quality ingredients?
[179:47.22]Now this thing kind of sucks.
[180:03.32]Still looking for what am I looking for?
[180:05.12]I got it all OK.
[180:06.80]Alright, let's go back to town.
[180:09.99]And I'm going to turn these in.
[180:11.29]You enter the portal.
[180:23.16]Flavorless Nutrient Paste.
[180:34.96]Superior Maestro Cape of Spines.
[180:37.54]I mean, they have boots, right?
[180:43.39]Damage dealt.
[180:47.65]Okay, how come these quests, the first few quests were giving me these crazy items?
[180:58.28]I'm getting superior dirty boots.
[181:00.52]Level 11.
[181:02.12]Okay, level 9.
[181:02.64]What's this one?
[181:28.67]Eleven.
[181:29.41]Okay.
[181:30.95]Do you have any bullshit I need to sell?
[181:36.87]Yeah, you do.
[181:41.85]There's a video of you drooling over dog food.
[181:46.85]Hell, there's a video of me making a joke about drooling over dog food.
[181:56.57]See, you're missing the context.
[182:03.35]This thing is actually crazy though, isn't it?
[182:34.26]There's literally a video of you eating it.
[182:36.06]Alright.
[182:55.06]He didn't even get anything in stock.
[182:56.90]These things suck.
[183:07.48]Can you explain the entire game to me?
[183:10.56]Game came out 25 years ago.
[183:12.43]People thought it was kind of fun.
[183:13.73]Game gets remade 20 years, 30 years later.
[183:18.21]People enjoy it.
[183:18.83]People have a lot of fun.
[183:23.41]Has this been on the ground the whole time?
[183:26.66]Hello, wanderer.
[183:44.44]Okay, should I hold on to the three socket gear?
[183:51.37]Are there rune words or anything like that or no?
[184:02.95]It's not superior.
[184:04.33]Okay, I don't care.
[184:11.11]Anybody have any... I need more potions.
[184:15.17]Basilisk of Rage.
[184:33.78]I already have Fireball, don't I?
[184:35.90]Yeah.
[184:37.90]Fire Ring.
[184:38.60]I think I'm going to get Fire Ring.
[184:42.89]Or Fire Wall.
[184:51.73]Ooh, frost.
[184:55.35]I want this.
[184:55.79]I got to break them, taking up though.
[185:02.20]I'll be back in a few minutes.
[185:03.56]I'm going to get some water.
[185:09.13]I'll be right back.
[185:20.08]Oh, that's right.
[185:20.52]Let's see if we can see the eclipse.
[185:21.88]I'll go see if we can see it.
[185:24.36]I'll let you know.
[185:24.85]I'll report back.
[185:29.31]See you in a few minutes.
[185:33.75]The ads will start in about 25 seconds.
[185:36.94]Here we go.
[186:00.82]Let's pray.
[187:20.66]so so
[188:07.23]Thank you.
[188:38.76]Thank you.
[189:22.59]Thank you.
[189:53.78]Let's pray.
[190:44.02]How's it going?
[191:09.82]So we can see it a little bit.
[191:11.74]It kind of looks, it's just really bright.
[191:15.01]I wouldn't say it looks very bloody.
[191:16.81]It's just sort of bright.
[191:19.45]It's really, it's a spotlight.
[191:22.33]It's lighting up the whole sky.
[191:23.39]It's crazy.
[191:27.79]It'll be red later.
[191:31.79]Another hour we'll have to see.
[191:39.67]let's get back to it alright so what was I doing I was I want to get the frost bill I think alright what's the best spell in the game that's well don't spoil it summon fire drake um alright shocking burst I want something besides fireball this is 45 magic to use it but it's probably awesome
[192:12.42]shock burst this is expensive but I'm gonna get it do you think the moon is an extroverted introvert okay hey mods put put extroverted introvert on the banned words list I don't want to see that fucking phrase ever again uh I'm gonna get this this seems fun it's like chain lighting
[192:44.09]Muffle magic.
[192:51.85]I need to be, yeah, let's get it.
[192:53.49]I'm doing it.
[192:58.26]So you get one point of minimum damage in one and four points of max damage per attack skill level.
[193:04.70]It's kind of amazing.
[193:06.92]Alright.
[193:07.22]What do I have?
[193:09.84]I'll get that next level.
[193:11.93]I spent almost all my money.
[193:13.69]That's all my money.
[193:20.34]Let's gamble the rest of it.
[193:24.00]Where's the gambler?
[193:25.64]Yes.
[193:26.10]Alright, belt.
[193:38.55]Superior belt.
[193:39.73]32 strength though.
[193:40.15]That sucks.
[193:43.70]32 magic?
[193:47.66]That's a monstrous amount of life, though.
[193:49.90]Let's see if I get something better.
[193:50.78]Here we go.
[193:53.20]1, 2, 3.
[193:55.38]Yep.
[194:01.22]I lose a lot of health, but... Tons more magic.
[194:21.63]It's 5 a.m.
[194:22.45]They think I should go to sleep.
[194:23.51]What's your take?
[194:24.09]Whatever you say goes.
[194:26.64]I would say 5 a.m.
[194:29.38]is kind of that hour.
[194:32.78]I used to spend a lot of time staying up really late.
[194:38.20]And anytime that you go past 5, your whole brain just turns into mush.
[194:47.14]next day and almost forever after that unless you reset your sleep your sleep schedule you really do it your brain turns to absolute mush and I think it's that 5 a.m if you can actually get to sleep before sunrise and you can get up before and so it's not just daylight into daylight or daylight into darkness
[195:17.65]That daylight into darkness always messed me up because you'd go to bed with them when the sun was coming up and you'd wake up when it was going down.
[195:24.19]That would happen sometimes.
[195:25.07]I remember it was sometimes 7, 8, 9 o'clock in the morning.
[195:34.04]And you just... The sun is out.
[195:37.28]People are moving.
[195:38.22]The world is alive.
[195:39.46]And then you fall asleep and you wake up and it's just dark.
[195:42.10]Alright, let's keep going.
[195:46.32]No, don't do that.
[195:47.18]What am I doing?
[195:47.82]I already have a portal.
[195:57.13]I need 45 magic.
[196:00.00]Actually... I want to do the bats.
[196:09.12]Let's remove the crabs.
[196:26.84]How do I... Right click a spell and then click... Okay.
[196:34.50]That's what I want to work with right now.
[196:35.58]Let's do the bats.
[196:43.49]I think they heal, right?
[196:44.33]They leech?
[196:50.44]Nope.
[196:50.72]I just assumed that because they were vampire bats.
[196:55.24]I still need to find something on here.
[196:56.36]Where is it?
[196:57.58]I need to find.
[197:01.77]Gonna find a dagger apparently.
[197:06.47]If I take a quest.
[197:08.83]And then go like oh, it's on the ground.
[197:10.89]I did it.
[197:11.17]GG.
[197:11.23]What does it do?
[197:17.12]Cool, you can do well.
[197:29.22]That's helpful.
[197:33.76]Couple of bosses to kill here.
[197:38.38]Your pet is increased in power.
[197:41.33]Pet is so strong now it's actually crazy.
[197:48.03]The welding is not recommended.
[197:54.72]I think I'm just going to dump all points into magic now.
[198:03.53]Bats are kind of crazy.
[198:05.91]Almost level nine.
[198:29.25]I'm kind of under level for this area.
[198:33.30]Like three or four levels lower than everything here.
[198:37.99]I'm not going to go down yet.
[198:38.97]I want to get to level 10 or level nine at least.
[198:41.21]Uh, cannot help me.
[198:54.38]Ouch.
[199:03.56]I love how the summoning is so much louder than everything else in the whole game.
[199:14.52]What's the most cringe thing that you have ever done?
[199:16.20]Probably trying to sing sometimes on stream.
[199:21.84]And you know you have to go all in.
[199:24.33]And you tell yourself you're going to go all in.
[199:27.97]And you act like you're going all in, but you're not going all in at all.
[199:33.19]And... Yeah, I get to write it off as a joke.
[199:39.27]Because that's what it always was.
[199:42.30]But sometimes you listen back to some of the times that you've tried.
[199:45.48]Or I've tried, right?
[199:48.10]And sometimes you hit the notes sometimes.
[199:49.78]But a lot of the times you get that... You know the one.
[199:54.44]The... And it's... That was it.
[200:01.33]Yeah.
[200:03.77]You're so flat that you sound like you're in pain.
[200:11.75]That's what I mean.
[200:18.02]Like if you can't differentiate between that person just got punched in the stomach versus I'm trying to hit a high note or any note for that matter.
[200:27.40]Alright.
[200:29.70]I'm level 10 now.
[200:33.49]No, I'm not.
[200:33.93]I just saw that and thought I was level 10.
[200:48.28]That's tonight's gonna be a good night.
[200:49.80]Yeah.
[200:50.12]Tonight's gonna be a good night.
[200:58.67]Oof.
[201:01.61]To be fair though, I was fucking around.
[201:12.96]Oh, I was like, what happened?
[201:13.74]Alright, I got to 50 magic.
[201:18.50]Let's just dump it.
[201:22.54]More attack magic skill.
[201:23.70]Alright, let's do this new spell.
[201:24.89]What do I got?
[201:25.31]There it is.
[201:25.63]You have learned a new spell.
[201:31.74]Or is it lightning?
[201:37.60]Shocking first.
[201:40.85]That look 26 to 90.
[201:42.43]That's a lot more than this.
[201:45.91]What does it look like?
[201:50.28]OK.
[201:51.50]That takes a lot of mana, but it will probably kill everything.
[201:59.15]You were in a closet for 15 minutes and just screamed.
[202:05.24]What?
[202:06.38]Did I?
[202:06.70]What do you mean?
[202:10.52]Your pack is full.
[202:12.41]Your pack is full.
[202:13.61]I screamed in a... I was in a closet and I was screaming?
[202:24.85]Holy shit, that's plus 10.
[202:27.69]I actually kind of have to hold on to that.
[202:42.06]That's actually crazy.
[202:43.14]I need mana potions.
[203:01.50]Plus eight ice damage.
[203:10.61]My AirPods are about to die.
[203:11.61]Can you put another ad break on so I can charge them?
[203:15.23]Uh, in an hour.
[203:15.95]You ever heard of a game called Woopo?
[203:24.85]No?
[203:26.89]I don't know.
[203:27.43]What is that?
[203:32.79]Does that include ice spells?
[203:35.05]Or is that ice melee damage?
[203:46.90]I want to kill something with my new move.
[203:51.22]It's just melee.
[203:52.06]Cool.
[203:52.40]Okay.
[203:57.30]Okay, I got to go down to level 11 and then I'll make a portal and I'll get some ships.
[204:08.72]I like this game though.
[204:09.46]This is really cozy.
[204:13.52]I imagine the real difficulty of this game is when you get to level 40 and I mean the actual dungeon level.
[204:22.09]And then you reset it and everything gets harder.
[204:27.77]Can you just do that?
[204:28.39]You can do that in an infinite amount of times apparently.
[204:33.29]Oh damn, that did a lot.
[204:42.48]Oh back here.
[204:48.36]Hardcore is pretty rough too.
[204:49.40]Hey dude, your views are dropping.
[205:02.01]Yeah, whatever.
[205:06.81]I mean, it's getting kind of late.
[205:09.81]It is 10 p.m.
[205:10.53]Pacific.
[205:10.89]That's pretty late.
[205:11.81]And, I don't know, maybe you want to go to bed for real.
[205:13.59]Okay, new area.
[205:30.48]I am level 9, so this is not just going to be simple, I don't think.
[205:43.09]Well, no, I can't leave these two things I have to do here.
[205:51.68]What about favorite cake?
[205:52.68]Oh, I love cake.
[205:53.98]Let's talk about cake.
[205:57.54]Icebox cake is my favorite cake.
[206:00.25]Icebox cake and then a chocolate ice cream cake.
[206:06.11]And behind that is probably carrot cake.
[206:16.13]I don't have enough mana.
[206:20.87]What the fuck is that thing?
[206:22.11]Uh oh, hold on a second.
[206:27.31]Uh, that thing is insanely big.
[206:31.63]What is that?
[206:32.15]There's a giant dragon.
[206:41.27]Is it still alive?
[206:46.07]Nope, hold on.
[206:55.19]I don't want to die here.
[207:21.11]Prentice's Mantle?
[207:31.94]Never heard of icebox cake.
[207:35.14]Icebox cake is... It's effectively just... whipped cream and chocolate wafers.
[207:46.26]So you take a whipped cream or a lot of you, and you can make, you can take the heavy cream and stuff too.
[207:53.71]But the whole point is you put it in the fridge, you layer in the chocolate wafers into, uh, like what is effectively a, a cream cake and you put it in the fridge overnight and everything kind of melts together.
[208:11.19]So it's not about, oh, it's whipped cream and chocolate wafers.
[208:14.09]No, no, it's the fact that it turns into this kind of thick, jelly, creamy mush in the fridge overnight.
[208:24.03]It really just wants to be tiramisu.
[208:26.72]It's like tiramisu if you don't want to make tiramisu.
[208:33.62]It's the I don't give a shit tiramisu.
[208:35.14]Because it's really easy to make.
[208:39.62]And it's delicious.
[208:41.78]It's just like trifle.
[208:44.31]Yeah, not jelly.
[208:44.93]Jelly's right.
[208:45.41]It's just like creamy and a little thicker than typical whipped cream.
[208:48.71]Especially if you make the whipped cream on your own.
[208:52.13]You actually make it yourself.
[208:54.78]Oh, what?
[209:02.28]This might be kind of good.
[209:14.68]Icebox cake can be kind of described as it tastes like cookies and cream.
[209:20.78]So if you like cookies and cream, you will love icebox cake.
[209:25.44]But you got to make it right.
[209:26.30]There's millions of recipes.
[209:27.96]Go get a default recipe for it.
[209:29.78]You'll love it.
[209:47.08]Can you get it from the bakery?
[209:48.02]I don't think it's that popular to get.
[209:50.29]I don't think people are pre-making it at a bakery.
[209:53.77]It's not super popular.
[209:57.19]Because it's very easy to make on your own too.
[210:00.81]Do you wish you had a tail?
[210:08.73]No, absolutely not.
[210:12.17]I would sit on that thing vertically and snap it in half and it would like go up my ass and like through my spine and shit.
[210:19.14]Nope.
[210:23.10]No, thank you.
[210:32.77]I hope they didn't hear that.
[210:37.65]I hope they did.
[210:38.25]I hope you didn't open the stream and hear me talk about that.
[210:40.53]But hey.
[210:41.13]What's going on?
[210:42.83]Thanks for the raid, Vinny.
[210:47.07]We heard it.
[210:47.93]Oh no, that's a bad thing to come.
[210:49.63]That's a bad thing to come over here to.
[210:57.73]Thanks for the raid, dude.
[210:59.57]What was Vinny doing?
[211:00.29]I've been kind of locked in here.
[211:06.32]Making a good impression, dear.
[211:09.38]LSD.
[211:10.98]Ooh.
[211:13.56]LSD jam.
[211:17.05]Vinny's always got so much cool shit going on in his streams.
[211:24.67]Yeah, welcome.
[211:26.79]We are chilling out late night gaming style.
[211:31.58]I saw that they remade Fate.
[211:35.56]Fate is an old wild tangent game.
[211:39.40]Again, it was confirmed not a virus.
[211:43.00]Even though I thought it was.
[211:46.10]And they apparently they remade it or remastered it and.
[211:50.30]Just a fun little game to play, so that's what we're doing tonight.
[211:59.46]Yeah, what was I was fishing?
[212:01.02]That's what I was doing.
[212:05.67]If you were forced to be a furry, what would your persona be?
[212:11.98]Didn't we go over this already?
[212:18.40]I love how you say forced to be a furry.
[212:22.43]Like it's not like a choice I would be making.
[212:24.49]Hey man, if you're forced to be a furry, why am I getting forced to be a furry?
[212:35.29]Ever since seeing that Ratman from Arx Fatalis, I've been thinking, man.
[212:41.32]I want to see more Ratmen.
[212:47.44]Rhino?
[212:48.62]Cool.
[212:51.14]I got shit to do here.
[212:51.96]What am I doing?
[212:52.72]I got to kill... I got to get the Wizard Hat.
[212:56.41]And if you think I'm going to turn the Wizard Hat quest in, you are crazy.
[212:59.93]Because it's going to be ridiculous.
[213:02.69]So, not turning that one in.
[213:10.60]Oh hey, all the people from Vinny's stream.
[213:12.48]Do you guys... Is it everybody in the world that can see it or is it just North America?
[213:18.37]The blood moon is coming.
[213:21.05]In 45 minutes, like an hour, right?
[213:23.95]Think we're gonna see it?
[213:28.55]It's just NA?
[213:30.76]Well for all the NA viewers, maybe.
[213:32.02]Maybe you'll see it.
[213:36.54]North and South America, okay.
[213:42.08]How do I get over here?
[213:51.19]Oh, also, the next time I do one of these just kind of late night hangout streams, don't spoil it.
[213:59.09]No spoilers.
[214:02.22]But I really want to play a dark room.
[214:04.92]You guys ever play a dark room?
[214:14.93]It's an old, old game from 10 years ago.
[214:18.26]It's a text-based game where you just have to stoke a fire.
[214:23.24]And it's kind of an incremental game, but it's really, really fun.
[214:30.83]I haven't played it in a long time.
[214:32.53]Figured it'd be cool for one of these streams where I'm just kind of sitting around hanging out.
[214:45.20]Where... I still haven't come across this wizard hat.
[214:48.57]Where have I not been?
[214:51.69]Right in the middle?
[215:17.05]There's a Switch version released in 2019.
[215:18.63]There's a Steam version now too, I think.
[215:22.48]That's the one that I, yeah, I think I bought it.
[215:28.58]I wonder how they differ.
[215:34.40]It looks like the three or four versions have pretty small differences, I think.
[215:38.38]I think.
[215:54.32]Be confident for once.
[215:56.52]I am confident.
[215:57.78]Whoa.
[215:58.98]Warlock staff.
[216:00.84]What the fuck did I just pick up?
[216:06.00]That thing is insane.
[216:09.57]25 to attack magic skill.
[216:12.79]Mana stolen.
[216:13.95]10% mana bonus.
[216:14.43]That's insane.
[216:14.93]That's actually insane.
[216:19.05]Alright.
[216:19.25]So what should I do to this?
[216:19.97]Should I...
[216:22.25]Enchanted or add something to it?
[216:24.47]What can I do to it?
[216:27.13]I need 45.
[216:27.41]How much strength do I have right now?
[216:30.95]That's not good.
[216:33.53]Alright, I just don't lose this.
[216:36.63]Keep fishing.
[216:37.13]Hold on.
[216:37.53]Let's get good stuff when you fish.
[216:44.82]Have you said the Diablo II Paladin Scepter yet?
[216:46.94]No, you're right.
[216:48.12]I forgot about that.
[216:51.05]I can't even do it.
[216:51.80]I can't even try.
[216:52.44]It's the Diablo II Paladin Scepter.
[217:05.18]That's as good as you're gonna get tonight.
[217:17.31]Why do you fail fishing?
[217:19.43]Is it something I can improve?
[217:33.27]Too slow.
[217:33.69]Okay, if I did a sound effects compilation and sold it, do you think it would be used?
[217:51.89]That laugh that I just did.
[217:54.45]Do you think that if that was part of a sound compilation... Hey, you buy this and you get a library of sound effects or a library of... voices or voice effects or whatever.
[218:05.27]Do you think people would use it?
[218:12.52]And is that my road to a hundred million dollars?
[218:20.26]Everyone would just steal it.
[218:25.21]There's no way that would be worth 100 million.
[218:28.76]I suck so bad at this.
[218:29.90]I keep looking at chat.
[218:30.76]Fishing is like a chat game.
[218:32.90]I cast it and look over to my other monitor.
[218:44.26]I gotta be quick.
[218:44.83]Hold on.
[219:03.45]There's already a voice line emporium I use all the time.
[219:15.23]Now it's not doing it because I have... Okay, I'm looking at chat now.
[219:17.53]Is it going to happen?
[219:19.55]Let's see.
[219:19.83]I'm going to re-chat.
[219:22.09]I knew it.
[219:24.25]I just got something insane.
[219:25.07]I got an achievement for it.
[219:26.58]What did I just get?
[219:29.12]Parentos Cheesehead of the Emerald Bay not identified.
[219:32.20]What the fuck is this?
[219:33.02]This thing seems like rare.
[219:35.57]Wait, is it worth more if it's unidentified like in Diablo II?
[219:47.98]Because in Diablo II, you got a certain price for certain items because it was unidentified.
[219:58.16]Holy shit.
[219:59.84]That sucks.
[220:09.93]It kind of doesn't... That's a massive vitality penalty.
[220:12.75]Hold on.
[220:15.81]Well, I got to give my dog some stuff.
[220:17.47]Wait a minute.
[220:21.79]I'm not leaving this spot.
[220:22.99]This is the absolute best fishing spot.
[220:25.11]Look at what I've gotten from fishing here.
[220:33.68]178.
[220:33.98]Yeah, that's bad.
[220:41.09]I guess you just have a magic find build.
[220:49.74]And I'll hold it.
[220:50.28]That's cool.
[220:55.21]That's too much to lose.
[221:03.24]How do you take care of your hair?
[221:04.28]Uh, I... I, um... I use... What the hell do I use?
[221:13.39]I used to use Lush.
[221:15.55]But... I don't do Lush anymore.
[221:21.95]Honey, what's my brand?
[221:24.35]Honey, what's my brand?
[221:27.38]What's it called?
[221:37.95]Yeah, it's a shampoo and it's a coconut shampoo and conditioner.
[221:42.93]Oh, do the cheese head for fishing.
[221:44.11]That's a good idea.
[221:47.41]Just magic fine.
[221:48.09]Why not?
[221:55.95]Now the two and one.
[221:56.61]No, it's a shampoo and conditioner bundle.
[222:06.98]How do you say that?
[222:07.60]Is it Maui?
[222:11.08]Maui, right?
[222:12.86]Maui?
[222:13.84]Maui?
[222:22.17]That stuff's great.
[222:23.71]The coconut Maui, it leaves my hair smooth.
[222:27.17]Soft.
[222:29.07]Soft.
[222:33.75]Although Holly did say that I smelled like fresh waffles yesterday.
[222:37.81]I don't know.
[222:39.45]If you want to smell like sugary fresh waffles, then I guess that's the one you should use.
[222:59.77]What's the best gacha for setup?
[223:01.35]I don't know what I'm doing.
[223:02.57]Oh man, you're playing a great game.
[223:07.65]You got a great one on your hands.
[223:10.15]I missed that game.
[223:11.11]I played that game on stream.
[223:15.66]Wow.
[223:17.52]I just got a lunar eclipse.
[223:28.32]Okay.
[223:34.82]They changed the formula on the belief cream.
[223:37.34]I heard about that.
[223:39.33]I still like it.
[223:39.91]It still works for me.
[223:41.71]But I did hear about the formula change and how some people don't like it.
[223:44.63]Shit.
[224:08.48]And when you got in an argument over what a log splitter was... Yeah, I'm a soft city boy.
[224:40.39]Forest bow.
[224:43.64]You get some cool shit over here.
[224:45.22]Although this thing sucks.
[224:46.10]Never mind.
[224:47.06]Alright, three more times.
[225:02.91]What's the coffee?
[225:04.07]Oh yeah, I do Pete's Coffee.
[225:05.59]I do the Big Bang.
[225:08.71]I get the whole bean Big Bang.
[225:12.13]Been drinking that for a long time now, like a couple of years.
[225:26.59]We switch between that and Illy though.
[225:28.17]If Illy's available, I'll buy it every time.
[225:38.70]I did the big bang to your mom the other night.
[225:43.25]Okay, dude.
[225:48.45]Hey, you better watch it.
[225:49.27]My mother watches this stream.
[225:50.73]She might fucking at you and talk shit.
[225:58.49]Did I miss it already?
[226:21.10]I'm so slow with this.
[226:22.46]Alright, I'm gonna catch one more and I'm gonna go kill this boss.
[226:48.00]Come on, do it.
[226:54.42]You would hate the Stardew fishing.
[226:56.24]I... I didn't mind Stardew fishing.
[227:01.00]I got a Stardew playthrough.
[227:02.10]It's like one of the first things I ever streamed.
[227:03.60]Alright, I'm out of here.
[227:17.23]I'll just sit here all night and be addicted to this.
[227:18.65]I get this cheese head off.
[227:25.08]Maybe I'll just keep it on.
[227:27.00]I'm not really having that much trouble right now.
[227:31.24]30% magic fine and more gold.
[227:32.34]Why not?
[227:32.94]That means I can gamble more.
[227:36.38]Okay, let's go.
[227:44.63]Still looking for this wizard hat.
[227:55.24]Making burgers.
[227:55.76]What do you want on yours?
[227:56.50]I already told you my burger.
[227:57.53]It's the Five Guys order.
[228:01.09]Jalapeños.
[228:02.37]Grilled onions.
[228:03.91]A1 sauce.
[228:05.49]And if you're feeling like you want a little bit extra, a little bit of mayo.
[228:09.33]Doesn't need it though.
[228:09.99]The A1 does plenty.
[228:11.54]And it's a cheeseburger.
[228:15.90]A1, grilled onions, jalapeños.
[228:18.12]Cheeseburger.
[228:28.35]Not too spicy.
[228:30.73]No, the jalapeños that Five Guys are pretty mild.
[228:32.89]They're not super harsh or anything.
[228:36.31]You are exhausted.
[228:43.18]He's going to leave if you start talking about food.
[228:45.14]I just actually thought about maybe like going to McDonald's after this.
[228:56.26]Come on, something good.
[229:12.93]I haven't been eating McDonald's.
[229:14.98]I've been staying away from a lot of fast food recently.
[229:19.54]Where's this freaking hat?
[229:21.69]I'm not swearing anymore.
[229:24.97]Lower left.
[229:40.11]What's the McDonald's order?
[229:41.47]I know the meme is that my McDonald's order is enough for like eight people.
[229:44.30]And that was like 99.2% joke because I did do that once and I ate the whole thing.
[229:52.68]I ordered that joke McDonald's order.
[229:55.35]I did it once or twice and I actually did eat all of it.
[230:00.57]No, it would be two McDoubles.
[230:08.54]10-piece nugget to share with whoever was in the party.
[230:14.22]And then... I don't know.
[230:17.98]Maybe that's probably it.
[230:23.57]I have to be over here.
[230:24.27]This is the only place I haven't been.
[230:25.27]Give me a stamina potion.
[230:26.91]I have like three of them.
[230:29.17]Come on.
[230:29.83]Where is this hat?
[230:37.40]maybe and maybe one more mcchicken plain mcchicken I love McDonald's though I really do I'm not gonna pretend and make it up but I I and I feel like people that say that they don't like it yeah you're I think you're a liar I think you're just lying
[231:06.62]It's like the person that says they don't drink soda and their fridge is full of soda.
[231:10.72]Like, yeah, you do.
[231:26.90]Burger King's alright too, though.
[231:30.08]I actually think that Burger King... I hate Burger King and I talk a lot of shit about it.
[231:35.62]But I could like, I could eat Burger King right now.
[231:40.22]A&W is better.
[231:40.94]A&W is good too.
[231:44.37]What about Dairy Queen?
[231:54.37]You know what was awesome?
[231:55.39]Jack in the Box.
[231:59.39]Holly and I had Jack in the Box like a year or two ago.
[232:03.57]And it was seriously some of the best fast food I've ever had in my life.
[232:08.01]And then never again.
[232:10.03]I don't know what happened.
[232:11.71]It was it was like the greatest fast food thing order we've ever had.
[232:14.21]Remember those places all suck.
[232:26.18]Where is this fucking wizard hat?
[232:37.88]And it was a weird burger that I got, too.
[232:39.90]It was, um... It was like a mushroom and Swiss burger or something.
[232:43.82]There was something fucked up.
[232:47.92]That you wouldn't ever want to get from a fast food place, but it was awesome.
[232:55.54]On the other side of the map... It was the double mushroom Swiss.
[233:09.67]Yeah, that's the grossest thing I've ever heard somebody say.
[233:11.99]I would not ever order that, but I did.
[233:15.29]And it was fantastic.
[233:18.97]Wait, that's not right.
[233:19.83]Wait, do I have this completely wrong?
[233:33.95]Other side of the map.
[233:35.03]I want this wizard hat so bad.
[233:42.34]Hey, Jerma, I eat like a five-year-old.
[233:44.28]Any tips?
[233:47.65]Yeah, eat junk.
[233:49.95]But definitely... You can eat junk a lot.
[233:54.35]And I'm assuming when you say you eat like a five-year-old, you eat a lot of just... Do five-year-olds eat a lot of junk?
[234:01.00]Wait, that's like young to be eating a lot of junk.
[234:03.64]Don't five-year-olds eat... Cheerios and...
[234:09.64]Like, bean paste and shit?
[234:12.02]Like, a five-year-old eats.
[234:17.33]Applesauce?
[234:18.17]Yeah, I'm thinking of like a... like a 12-year-old.
[234:29.00]Wait, Holly just said it.
[234:29.78]What is it?
[234:30.90]It might have been the Buttery Smashed Jack.
[234:35.04]It may have been discontinued.
[234:37.88]I don't- was it the buttery sma- ah, that sounds right up my alley, actually.
[234:41.78]What was on it?
[234:45.08]I'm about to give up on this hat, by the way.
[234:53.25]Five-year-olds eat nuggets and mac and cheese?
[234:58.29]Are- is that- is that the age where you start eating hot dog slices and mac and cheese and stuff?
[235:02.55]Or is that a couple years?
[235:04.71]Like seven, six, seven, eight.
[235:08.61]Because that happens for like one or two years of your life, which is, that's weird, isn't it?
[235:15.00]There is a finite place where you eat like hot dog pieces and mac and cheese for a year and a half.
[235:22.55]I guess it's between the ages of like five and seven.
[235:31.47]buttery smash Jack a new burger from Jack in the Box featuring a fourth pound smash patty grilled onions thick pickles and a new boss sauce oh this is not the right order that sounds I don't want that
[235:50.62]If you... Okay.
[235:52.26]The only place where I will eat a sauce that is a named sauce that you... Who knows?
[236:04.09]Is Cane's.
[236:08.44]I want to know what it is.
[236:09.64]Don't put the boss sauce on it.
[236:11.50]Just tell me what is that.
[236:16.58]Chick-fil-A?
[236:17.10]Alright, maybe.
[236:19.76]But canes, that cane sauce, I don't care what's in it.
[236:23.36]I would drink the cup of it.
[236:25.02]What is it?
[236:27.32]I don't know what this helmet is and I'm never going to find it.
[236:29.96]I've walked around a circle for like 30 minutes now.
[236:35.96]I've uncovered every single area of this map.
[236:41.66]Did I miss one little section somewhere?
[236:52.14]Look at the map.
[236:54.04]I don't see anything.
[236:57.94]Looks like I uncovered everything.
[237:07.75]Go up, up, up.
[237:09.43]Do you like thick or thin patties?
[237:10.87]I am a thin patty guy.
[237:12.97]Thick patties disgust me.
[237:17.61]I was already up here though, wasn't I?
[237:31.44]It's so weird how much of a weird person I am and how a lot of people do this too.
[237:35.50]It's not just me.
[237:37.68]I would rather have two thin patties than one gigantic one.
[237:42.74]Or one bigger one.
[237:45.68]Why is that?
[237:52.74]It's something about the ratio.
[237:58.72]More crust.
[238:00.28]Texture.
[238:10.57]Maybe you don't like it rare.
[238:11.88]I don't like rare anything.
[238:19.36]Even medium rare.
[238:20.44]Even medium a lot of times.
[238:21.56]I'll order medium sometimes.
[238:25.14]Oh, there's one over there.
[238:29.83]You give me a thin patty.
[238:32.71]Thin single patty.
[238:34.37]We're talking like three to four ounces, by the way.
[238:36.91]I like them thin and I like them smushed.
[238:42.45]Grilled onions all over it.
[238:44.10]A nice one slice of cheese on it.
[238:49.16]Uh, of mayo.
[238:52.08]Spoon it around.
[239:00.21]One big, nice piece of crunchy iceberg lettuce.
[239:05.70]I need to leave this level, because I'm just... I have to go down.
[239:09.44]I don't know where this is, and I'm just... I have not made any progress in 25 minutes.
[239:14.90]There it is.
[239:17.18]It's in that room.
[239:19.02]I think I just found it.
[239:24.68]Yes!
[239:25.24]This is definitely it.
[239:29.60]Come on!
[239:30.16]What?! !
[239:36.24]Are you kidding me?
[239:41.72]It's not in here?
[239:42.58]Damn it.
[239:51.67]I want to get it though.
[239:52.65]It's called a wizard hat.
[239:56.49]I am playing a wizard.
[239:57.55]Any more info on the quest log?
[240:02.41]Maybe I can't do it.
[240:03.23]Maybe I lost my opportunity to do it.
[240:07.56]You get a ton of money for this though.
[240:12.88]Level 11.
[240:14.56]No?
[240:14.74]That's it?
[240:16.33]It's by the blue staircase.
[240:17.61]Are you sure?
[240:24.08]Past the blue icon.
[240:35.10]The vendor might actually sell it.
[240:37.20]Oh.
[240:45.21]The Jerma Experience Podcast, where he yaps for three hours while pretending to play a game.
[240:51.69]Oh, I was playing it for a very fair portion of it.
[240:54.31]It's just when you talk about food, you just, it throws everything off.
[241:05.36]What did I just do?
[241:05.92]I just hit the space bar.
[241:06.88]What did the space bar do?
[241:19.03]Past the blue... Alright, I'm over here now.
[241:24.27]Here we are.
[241:24.77]Okay.
[241:32.91]Yeah.
[241:35.19]Oh, what the fuck?
[241:36.59]Oh, what the fuck?
[241:38.19]Oh, what the fuck?
[241:39.55]Oh, what the fuck?
[241:40.84]Oh, this thing's not even good.
[241:53.54]Hmm.
[241:54.74]It's kind of good.
[242:00.64]Um...
[242:02.58]I have all the quests done.
[242:05.50]Do you have Costco food?
[242:12.79]I... It's probably a long time.
[242:15.37]I haven't been to Costco in a long time.
[242:16.57]This thing sells for $16,000.
[242:29.90]That's funny.
[242:34.07]You're not a Costco guy.
[242:36.97]No, I'm not.
[242:51.89]That's a lot of vitality.
[242:55.02]I'll be getting the strength anyways because of this staff, right?
[243:01.16]Hold on to these.
[243:11.56]I'll examine these in a minute.
[243:14.80]I need another book of identify.
[243:23.53]Very nice.
[243:26.77]Alright, I got 46,000 gold now.
[243:32.95]We're going to immediately throw it all in the garbage.
[243:35.05]I need gloves, finally.
[243:38.09]50 strength.
[243:39.59]These are superior.
[243:44.28]Oh, what should I spend the money on?
[243:49.86]I'm going to end up with 50 strength eventually.
[243:52.44]Let's do it.
[243:58.70]Ready?
[243:58.88]Okay, I'm glad it didn't happen because that's a lot of money and I just kind of had second thoughts and now I don't think I want to do it.
[244:18.87]Oh, look at these fucking things.
[244:20.83]These things are crazy.
[244:21.93]Do I have to change my build now?
[244:24.89]10 to magic charm skill.
[244:42.61]Shit.
[244:46.14]How many people do you think are asleep in here?
[244:47.61]That's why I just kind of didn't scream.
[244:54.91]I could have gone... I was thinking about it.
[245:09.34]Sell the cheese?
[245:10.24]No!
[245:18.05]I want to go see if I can see the, uh, the eclipse.
[245:23.68]And it's been about an hour, so time for another break.
[245:28.02]Time to get up.
[245:30.46]This might be the last break of the evening.
[245:33.84]We'll see.
[245:34.34]I'm still having fun.
[245:35.04]I like this game a lot.
[245:40.14]It's a cozy game.
[245:40.80]1126 Pacific.
[245:44.77]So not quite.
[245:55.52]I'll be back in three or four minutes.
[245:59.37]Ads will be starting right now.
[247:04.63]do do
[247:49.64]Thank you.
[248:16.55]you
[248:50.53]Thank you.
[249:33.06]Thank you.
[250:13.88]How are we doing?
[250:17.96]It's getting there.
[250:21.41]We just took a look out.
[250:23.91]It's kind of starting to eclipse over it.
[250:29.67]Yeah, definitely.
[250:31.21]We'll stop for a minute or two.
[250:33.65]Because I want to go see it.
[250:34.71]I want to actually go look at it in like 40 minutes.
[250:39.07]And then, you know, we'll probably end there.
[250:42.57]Maybe I'll end tonight and everybody can just go around and look out here in North America, South America.
[250:52.48]Yeah, these things are really good.
[250:53.90]That's an unbelievable vitality bonus.
[250:56.04]Alright, I need to do.
[251:00.74]Yeah, look at how these things are terrible.
[251:02.06]Get these out of here.
[251:05.44]I want these boots.
[251:14.05]they're better than what I had oh you can't see anything oops uh here's what you missed I bought these they were only 950 gold
[251:46.95]I'm going to fish for... Yeah, let me see if I can get one of these.
[251:52.51]Magic.
[251:53.99]Nice.
[251:56.39]That's better, right?
[251:57.19]8% magic bonus versus 15% attack bonus.
[252:02.96]Mean attack spells, though.
[252:21.07]No.
[252:29.64]It's your chance to hit while swinging.
[252:33.84]So this is better then.
[252:34.68]I lose some health, but it's fine.
[252:43.67]Alright.
[252:44.25]I have to get rid of this thing.
[252:49.16]I need a better one handed weapon.
[252:53.45]Until I get to the warlock stuff.
[252:59.87]I guess I don't really have anything else.
[253:06.38]I'm happy with this for now.
[253:07.20]I'm going to save the money.
[253:14.60]That's good, but not for me.
[253:28.82]Yes!
[253:29.94]Holy shit!
[253:34.25]I really don't want to say holy shit, but like that's kind of crazy, right?
[253:37.33]45%?
[253:40.69]Is that a holy shit moment?
[253:51.08]I don't know.
[253:54.44]But that's definitely better than zero stat earrings.
[254:00.24]Wow.
[254:02.58]Okay, I can cast way more spells now.
[254:07.78]184 versus 108.
[254:08.79]And plus 9 to attack magic skill bonus.
[254:19.71]I know I'm talking like I know what I'm saying, but it's still pretty cool.
[254:23.07]Alright, now I'm done.
[254:27.66]What does this do now?
[254:28.34]60 to 65?
[254:29.28]35 to 126.
[254:29.46]Okay, well, alright.
[254:31.62]I got to stash a bunch of junk.
[254:50.95]Well, Ster is here.
[254:52.35]Ster, you play Fate?
[254:54.27]Look at this game.
[254:55.65]It's pretty sick.
[254:56.51]Look at this.
[254:59.39]Hey, Ster dreams of items like this.
[255:04.71]Ster, you probably have dreams of picking up an item with this much good shit on it.
[255:18.66]Did you actually play Fate, though?
[255:22.89]You're a Torchlight guy.
[255:33.39]You already left.
[255:33.97]Why do I have two of these books?
[255:42.38]Which one of you told me to buy that?
[255:43.60]It said Nell's reminds me a lot of Torchlight 1 though.
[255:54.24]He said, he said now.
[256:01.51]I'm going to give one of these to the pig.
[256:05.27]I don't like calling Otto the pig, but he technically was a pig at the beginning of the game.
[256:14.58]Torchlight stole its ideas from this.
[256:16.32]Alright, correct me if I'm wrong, but if you made something, do you steal it from yourself?
[256:24.23]Because isn't the people that made Fate, the people that made the first Torchlight?
[256:33.01]Or at least some of the team made Torchlight?
[256:38.90]It was the same dev, yeah, that's what I mean.
[256:40.22]Yeah.
[256:51.15]Yeah, I mean, if I made Dollhouse 2, but it was called something else, it would just be Dollhouse 2.
[257:04.83]You stole that from Jerma.
[257:10.33]We're not doing that, by the way.
[257:11.69]That shit's not happening.
[257:28.88]Can we just boss you around in your normal house?
[257:36.19]The cyber helm of the snake is available.
[257:38.99]You have received a task.
[257:41.49]Level 13.
[257:42.33]You have received a quest.
[257:47.61]You have received a task.
[257:55.85]Okay, that's how you know that I've completely lost it, is if it's like... Introducing Dollhouse 2!
[258:02.10]Yeah, guys, we're doing it!
[258:03.20]And it really is just, like, a webcam, and I- just me.
[258:06.95]And- and I'm selling, like, signatures...
[258:15.93]What's the chat saying?
[258:16.79]What, you want me to get up from the chair?
[258:18.17]And when do you want me to go out the room?
[258:20.33]No way.
[258:20.97]And I walk out and I come back in and then like a pop-up comes up on the screen.
[258:25.21]It's like, it's like, it's like $149 to get like something signed for me that day only.
[258:37.37]That's how you know that I've completely lost it.
[258:43.17]What, you want me to get up and spin around in a circle?
[258:47.70]No, yeah, no, I saw somebody in chat said, get up and spin around in a circle.
[258:51.70]What the heck?
[258:52.44]Oh, and I get up and I do it.
[258:53.84]I just turn 360 degrees three or four times.
[259:00.07]Okay, I read this wrong.
[259:07.93]I thought it said dollhouse two, but it's you just taking a shit in your house.
[259:13.20]It's like the music playing.
[259:18.40]And I'm just sitting there reading a newspaper just having a shit.
[259:35.13]I don't know why I just said that like I was a British.
[259:39.09]I've never called it that before.
[259:40.41]I've never said having a shit in my whole life until right now.
[259:47.32]Where did that come from?
[259:48.18]Mate, you having a shit right now.
[260:02.36]I gotta get the big boys now.
[260:28.38]Am I doing- is this- am I overdoing it?
[260:30.62]I think I'm overdoing it.
[260:39.64]Whoa!
[260:42.17]Piece of fucking shit.
[261:03.45]I wish I could find a pair of gloves.
[261:04.91]I have to take Otto to the storage trunk.
[261:15.74]That sounds bad.
[261:17.16]I need to take Otto to walk over to the storage trunk to take items from Otto and put it into the... Hold on.
[261:27.62]Let me rephrase this.
[261:33.75]I got too much crap.
[261:37.30]Why am I holding on to these?
[261:38.40]Why are these not on?
[261:44.10]These are just better.
[261:51.80]Get in there.
[261:52.29]Hey.
[262:01.81]Oh, I need the strength.
[262:07.23]Why was it green for a second though?
[262:08.74]OK, I think I'm ready.
[262:40.50]All these fishes.
[262:42.34]I'm not going to use any of these, honestly.
[262:46.35]He's already so cool already.
[262:54.67]Maybe some of these good ones like the Basilisk.
[262:57.59]Silverfin.
[263:01.25]This thing is ridiculous.
[263:07.91]Let's sell a bunch of this crap.
[263:20.80]Jew-less and Maiden-less.
[263:25.29]These sell for a lot.
[263:26.25]Alright, now I'm ready.
[263:36.50]I need 50 strength and 100 magic to put this on.
[263:45.56]Got it.
[263:45.82]I got plenty of stuff.
[263:48.73]I got my quests.
[263:51.49]Level 11.
[263:54.77]Then 13.
[264:15.35]Wait.
[264:16.59]Can this thing still spawn if I cleared everything already?
[264:33.07]What freaks you out more, roaches or spiders?
[264:36.87]Probably roaches because roaches can live forever.
[264:40.29]Oh, there he is right there.
[264:45.75]Spiders are cool.
[264:46.79]Spiders are helpful.
[264:49.11]When you see a spider, like, you're here, but you're not doing anything really bad.
[264:56.03]Alright, hold on a second.
[265:03.34]But if you see a roach... I killed that thing in one hit.
[265:08.00]I am so disgusting.
[265:09.10]My character is so OP.
[265:16.07]But seeing a roach signifies... Wait, why am I seeing a roach?
[265:26.51]Why am I seeing that?
[265:28.87]Is there food somewhere?
[265:30.11]Is there something that roach is getting into?
[265:40.41]Ooh?
[265:40.51]Axe Cutter?
[266:07.12]What does that mean?
[266:10.61]I don't see an axe cutter.
[266:28.80]Fire resistant.
[266:33.29]Is that good?
[266:41.60]He can't see him but he sees you.
[266:45.53]What?
[266:45.95]How?
[267:10.18]I just fammed heal.
[267:11.54]I'm an idiot.
[267:20.38]Hey, I need it.
[267:21.68]I'll take the one strength.
[267:37.63]I just smoked a fat ball.
[267:38.73]Any advice?
[267:39.25]Just relax.
[267:44.62]Don't think too deeply on very much.
[267:46.36]And just make sure you're not doing it too much.
[267:54.43]Okay, dad.
[267:55.11]Alright.
[267:56.29]The trap has been sprung.
[268:04.76]I'm just drinking these antidote potions.
[268:06.17]I'm not antidoting anything.
[268:09.31]Huh?
[268:23.72]These bats are awesome.
[268:28.94]I appreciate the timer down there and the health bars.
[268:32.66]When did this game come out?
[268:36.33]Like a hundred years ago?
[268:37.36]And I can have timers on my minions?
[268:41.24]Individual timers on my minions?
[268:42.90]This game came out a hundred years ago.
[268:45.54]What?
[268:51.71]You don't see that in any games now.
[269:18.98]Developed by Teddy Roosevelt.
[269:26.38]Fracked lapis.
[269:32.14]Faster cast speed.
[269:36.72]Pretty cool.
[269:43.36]What about Sonic the Hedgehog?
[269:44.52]Uh, Sonic's cool.
[269:48.05]Me and him, uh, me and him hang sometimes.
[269:53.04]He's a cool dude.
[269:55.28]He just wants to, he just wants to, like, chill and... Yeah, I know, I know Sonic.
[270:06.02]Yeah, I mean, he was over here a few days ago, and we played, um... I don't know, weirdly, we played, um...
[270:14.53]Bridge.
[270:16.09]The game Bridge with cards.
[270:18.05]He's a big fan.
[270:18.63]I didn't know he was that into Bridge.
[270:42.59]Ow.
[270:46.90]I gotta be careful if you die in the game.
[270:48.42]Your character dies in their real-life depiction of their universe.
[270:56.55]So if I die, my character in this universe will die in their real-life depiction of it.
[271:16.29]Oh shit, where's the guy that smoked that bowl?
[271:19.67]That guy right now is just sitting there going, wait, what?
[271:21.59]What do you mean?
[271:25.30]That guy's mouth is just open.
[271:27.12]Just wait, what is he talking about?
[271:30.10]Wait, you mean... Yeah, if the character dies in the game, it's their depiction of that reality that they're in, so it's real to them.
[271:36.95]Wait a minute.
[271:40.59]Wait a minute.
[271:43.77]What is real?
[272:01.00]They'll invent a way out of that.
[272:03.20]No.
[272:04.78]I'm sorry, guys.
[272:05.60]I'm not drinking that fucking... I'm not doing that.
[272:12.65]If there's like a... Oh, upload your consciousness.
[272:16.05]We've talked about this already.
[272:17.41]I want my cinder block... I want my head... My hender block.
[272:23.96]I want my head crushed with a cinder block when I die.
[272:29.73]Now, oh, we can upload you to the cloud.
[272:31.83]Don't, I don't want that.
[272:33.19]Crush my head with a cinder block.
[272:35.77]The second that I'm dead.
[272:38.89]And then turn me into a tree.
[272:40.11]Because guess what?
[272:42.59]If you upload your consciousness somewhere, people could probably fuck with it.
[272:47.56]People could probably mess with it.
[272:48.78]I know.
[272:49.94]I don't want to live forever doing that.
[272:52.50]That would suck.
[272:58.60]I told you, the fucking Uncle Larry is going to be in the will.
[273:05.14]And it's going to be the second that I flatline, my head needs to be destroyed with the cinder block.
[273:09.39]My brain needs to be crushed with the cinder block.
[273:18.14]We have a knock on middle.
[273:29.94]I don't care how it's done.
[273:32.94]And there needs to be two doctors in the room and a scientist that can confirm that there's been total, complete brain destruction.
[273:41.88]Nobody's sneaking in there and they go, I'm going to scoop a little bit and then I can have his consciousness.
[273:46.93]Nope.
[273:47.95]Doctor's going to be in there and it's going to be somebody that I trust.
[273:51.67]And they need to say that it has been completely liquefied and it's never coming back.
[274:10.08]Hey, who's your favorite Sonic character?
[274:12.22]Oh, right.
[274:14.68]Uh... Well, Tails, I guess.
[274:21.78]Kind of, uh... Kind of went off on a little over there.
[274:34.24]Hey dude, do you like the Sonic movie?
[274:36.16]I want you to crush my head with a cinder block when I die.
[274:38.41]Alright, here we go.
[274:50.25]13 is what I need.
[274:55.48]But I mean completely liquefying.
[274:58.50]Yeah, but fuck that though, guys.
[275:00.16]Like, let's be real.
[275:03.49]I don't know what technology is going to exist.
[275:05.30]They're going to be people like stealing people's consciousnesses.
[275:09.52]No, thank you.
[275:22.22]a thousand years from now if technology gets to a point where it's oh by the way one of the problems we have in the um in this online upload your brain universe who somebody can uh hack into your brain and uh make you think the all these things that you didn't think before oh and by the way they made you you could be trapped in a never-ending mine prison
[275:48.07]Oh, great.
[275:48.71]Yeah.
[275:49.15]Oh, no, no, no.
[275:49.89]Cinderblock.
[275:50.71]Oh, yeah.
[275:51.09]They weigh a lot.
[275:52.17]Yeah.
[275:53.79]Yeah.
[275:54.17]Crush my head.
[275:56.25]Yeah.
[276:12.46]Gigachad.
[276:13.38]Cinderblock.
[276:21.32]I love how that's a Giga Chat move, apparently.
[276:25.08]You gotta play the music too.
[276:28.16]But right before I go, I'm gonna be like, alright, I'm ready.
[276:32.94]Bring Larry in with the cinder block.
[276:35.42]It's just... And he just fucking smashes my head.
[276:59.56]Nice.
[277:02.48]I lost my minions.
[277:03.54]I don't even know what he just said.
[277:15.20]What did he say?
[277:16.46]All I heard
[277:22.69]Holy way, I got some cool stuff.
[277:26.91]He'll auto oh my God.
[277:30.79]Demon staff wait a minute.
[277:35.84]Oh boy.
[277:38.40]What could be?
[277:39.50]Oh boy, that's huge.
[277:46.22]I am killing things so quickly already.
[277:48.31]I'm just gonna walk through the whole game.
[278:00.59]Damn.
[278:06.01]I assume that includes spells, right?
[278:12.40]Holy shit.
[278:21.50]Well, time to kill every... Okay, I have this now.
[278:25.19]44 to 162.
[278:26.55]I think I'm just going to kill everything in one hit.
[278:29.55]I need to look for her.
[278:31.03]Oh, I got it all nice.
[278:31.75]Let's turn it off.
[278:38.39]You step into the portal.
[278:41.33]10 minutes till the moon.
[278:43.48]Oh OK, cool.
[278:52.84]Do you ever be friends with an alien?
[278:55.71]If the alien was nice to me, maybe.
[278:57.23]I don't want to be friends with no... dick alien.
[279:01.47]Why do you assume that aliens are dicks?
[279:20.30]Because all we hear about is that they abduct people.
[279:31.59]This requires so much magic for being a terrible item.
[279:57.64]It sells for a lot.
[280:01.90]Am I missing something here or what?
[280:23.36]Can you kill anybody in the village?
[280:24.58]I don't think so.
[280:27.14]Be welcome, traveler.
[280:32.98]I think I like what I got going on right now.
[280:40.12]The peak of the eclipse is in about 35 minutes, but I think it's about to start soon here.
[280:44.38]Alright, so what does this do?
[280:47.24]180,000 gold to make my character have a higher renown.
[280:53.95]Does that just make the game harder?
[281:09.26]Because I know the whole point with this game is you get through it and then you just keep going and going and going and going down the 40 floors.
[281:20.35]You get skill points.
[281:34.67]That's 75. 75.
[281:43.03]Will the cinder block that crushes you be a sponsored block?
[281:47.73]Um... I mean, I don't care.
[281:51.36]That'd be fine.
[281:52.24]As long as it weighed... 9 pounds, 12 pounds, whatever it was.
[281:57.38]15 pounds.
[281:57.66]How much is a cinder block?
[281:58.56]20 pounds?
[282:01.98]Yeah, but that money just would go to my heirs.
[282:05.79]That's fine.
[282:10.09]Hello!
[282:10.31]A little 16...
[282:12.56]You have received a quest.
[282:16.56]Three?
[282:16.98]That's level three bullshit out of here.
[282:21.35]You have received a task.
[282:28.47]Well met.
[282:30.68]You have received a task.
[282:44.74]You enter the portal.
[282:45.68]Are you going to stream this?
[282:48.38]Bro.
[283:00.35]15.
[283:08.80]Five minutes?
[283:12.08]Yeah, I'll get up.
[283:14.02]We'll go take a look.
[283:25.56]Dead.
[283:29.76]You got a perfect view of the moon right outside your house?
[283:32.26]Oh yeah.
[283:41.73]It's crazy looking right now.
[283:46.97]We get a Charlie raid too?
[283:52.58]Charlie coming in with a raid.
[283:56.59]What's up dude?
[283:59.49]Welcome everybody.
[284:03.22]We're chilling out, waiting for the eclipse.
[284:09.28]Which I did not know about until two hours ago when people told me about it.
[284:15.68]Yeah, thanks for the raid.
[284:17.23]Welcome.
[284:19.09]I'm playing the game called Fate.
[284:22.31]It is a remaster of the original Fate.
[284:25.59]And you get all four games.
[284:28.85]So if you liked this game when you were probably a little kid, it's available now.
[284:38.40]And it's pretty cozy.
[284:39.18]I like it.
[284:49.01]Where's the place to go down?
[284:50.23]Alright, was it getting time here?
[284:54.11]Like two minutes or so?
[284:55.88]Yeah, I'm going to go look.
[284:57.96]I'll be back.
[285:02.18]I'll give you my thoughts.
[285:02.90]No ads are going to play or anything.
[285:07.04]I'm just going to go look at it.
[285:10.72]Beer beat.
[285:43.95]you
[286:17.34]you
[287:34.70]It just looks cool.
[287:38.62]It kind of looks like a little floating soap bubble.
[287:41.24]Looks like a little bubble that you blew.
[287:48.79]Yeah, that was totally, that was fully, totally eclipsed.
[287:56.62]East Coast in 10 minutes.
[288:02.87]Full totality for another hour or more.
[288:05.13]Cool.
[288:12.33]Hey, Jerma, what happens when you retire?
[288:13.90]Uh, this, apparently.
[288:26.05]And what time is it two?
[288:26.77]It's, uh... Actually, it might probably end here in a minute.
[288:30.69]Once I get to the next floor.
[288:31.84]You're gonna hit your brain, Smashed.
[288:53.65]Yeah, I'm definitely into doing more of these late night just kind of hangout streams.
[288:59.11]I enjoy them.
[289:01.06]They're fun.
[289:06.14]I'll definitely beat this.
[289:10.10]Yeah, Ark Space Halos is the next stream that you'll see.
[289:12.73]That'll be probably during the day.
[289:13.83]I don't want to start that at 6, 7 o'clock at night.
[289:25.75]That's definitely a day stream kind of game.
[289:30.10]Uh, yeah, I think I'm gonna end here.
[289:31.86]I think it's a good time to end it here.
[289:41.31]I'd play Monster Hunter on one of these.
[289:44.43]That sounds good to me.
[289:45.11]Just kind of hanging out, just grinding some monsters.
[289:54.20]If I save and exit in here, I'm going to be fine, right?
[290:00.37]Yeah, go look at the moon if you haven't.
[290:04.05]I always get so annoyed because I miss these.
[290:06.73]I hear about them a day or two later and I go, wait a minute.
[290:09.35]Oh, right.
[290:09.77]I could have probably seen it.
[290:12.27]Or you plan that you want to do it and then something else just gets in the way and you just don't see it.
[290:23.54]Yeah, I'll be live the next day or two.
[290:25.48]If I'm not live tomorrow, then I'll be live on Sunday.
[290:32.46]Tomorrow's Friday?
[290:34.10]What day is it today?
[290:35.34]It's Friday, right?
[290:38.15]Friday tomorrow.
[290:44.21]Yeah, so you'll see me Saturday.
[290:47.43]If there's not another one of these tomorrow night, then you'll just see me on Saturday afternoon.
[290:52.03]We'll do Arx Batalis.
[290:52.99]I'll start it
[291:03.87]thanks for hanging out though and a lot of raids tonight we had Squeaks we had Vinny Charlie just came in I apologize I'm ending right after Charlie came in with a raid so yeah thanks a lot guys if you if you like these late night ones then I'll definitely do more of them

[292:02.75]uh okay so I have a random question the other the other fates the other fate undiscovered realm fate the traitor soul fate the curse king what if you beat the first one should you take a character that or is that a totally new game
[292:32.37]Would I take my character from this one and bring it over?
[292:34.77]It's just a fully new game.
[292:43.67]They are sequels, but you start from level one.
[292:45.77]Okay.
[292:49.43]Cool.
[292:52.09]Alright, guys.
