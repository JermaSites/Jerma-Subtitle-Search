[00:09.98]Today is a very special day.
[00:14.24]Every 25 years, the barbarian village of Elvenwood celebrates what they call the Warrior's Harvest, a fruitful, wonderful celebration of honor where the finest soldier in the village is chosen to venture out far away from camp and potentially to never return.
[00:34.25]I am that man.
[00:35.86]And I will accept the task to find out what happened to my old family's house, Castle Griffinsteed.
[00:44.46]Long since abandoned and corrupted by dark magic, I must find out what happened.
[00:50.14]I must uncover the secrets of my old family name, for I am Carl Griffinsteed, and my adventure begins.
[00:59.87]I give my final farewells and loom towards the path near the castle.
[01:05.44]There she stands, nearly 200 feet from our encampment.
[01:10.29]I see to my left there could be a broken down caravan, but I leave it.
[01:14.75]There may be a scary animal inside, and I don't want to deal with that.
[01:18.85]So as I move forward down the path, I think to myself, there's potential for bandits.
[01:24.48]The castle has been seized many times by many different forces.
[01:28.88]And my suspicions are correct.
[01:31.05]Bandits are waiting for me at an outpost.
[01:33.95]And we will see who will die today.
[01:36.49]It will not be me.
[01:38.89]I ready my sword and I charge forward.
[01:41.49]Or I wait for them to charge.
[01:42.92]They charge forward and I take my swing with my blade.
[01:45.66]I knock one of them down and their blades have no effect on me because they're just idiots.
[01:51.38]And almost totally unscathed, I walk away from this encounter.
[01:56.04]What war will lie ahead?
[01:57.52]What treachery, what deceit will lie ahead of me in Castle Gryffinstein?
[02:02.64]Where I stand right now, no man has stood.
[02:06.71]No man enters, no man returns.
[02:09.11]When you step in, you are there forever.
[02:11.81]So I hear from my old grandmother's stories.
[02:14.81]And here we go.
[02:16.69]A castle in ruin, once great, standing tall, is now a former fraction of what it used to be.
[02:25.56]But this is not the test.
[02:27.35]The test is the catacombs below.
[02:29.01]That was a checkpoint.
[02:31.13]The test is the catacombs below.
[02:33.73]One can only imagine the secrets and the horrible dungeons that lie ahead of me.
[02:39.34]But I will press on.
[02:40.94]I must find out what happened to my house.
[02:44.00]And I will bring back news to the tribe.
[02:47.22]A dead end.
[02:48.57]A choice.
[02:49.99]One can go left.
[02:51.65]Or one could possibly go r- Oh, coins!
[02:54.80]Coins, I need these!
[02:56.68]Cool.
[02:58.07]And what is this?
[02:59.27]What is going on in my father's dungeon?
[03:02.26]Are those... No, it can't be.
[03:04.62]Wizards!
[03:06.06]Evil wizards!
[03:07.16]I must dispose of them.
[03:08.32]They might be conjuring up some type of demon underneath my family's house.
[03:12.16]There's too many of them.
[03:13.13]I'm being overwhelmed.
[03:14.33]I need to find it.
[03:14.93]Oh, give me that shotgun.
[03:16.05]That works.
[03:17.15]Shoot him with the shotgun.
[03:18.65]I must cleanse them all.
[03:20.21]No, Doc.
[03:21.25]Black magic must be performed under here, and there could be hundreds, if not thousands of them.
[03:27.38]And the final one is dead.
[03:29.40]Hopefully I have stopped their ritual.
[03:32.38]My stomach is full of all kinds of fluid.
[03:34.88]I'm getting sick to my stomach, very nervous.
[03:37.62]There's only one way to go, and it's straight on.
[03:41.60]through my old family's prisons you can tell it's a prison because look there's bars on the wall through the corridor into the next room where there are coins alright okay well we got our supplies here too got a couple of healing potions what's that an uzi I don't I'm gonna take the uzi a magnum and a flail
[04:04.40]Nah, I don't want to use this.
[04:05.42]We're going to go with the Uzi.
[04:07.59]I think that's the best for this current situation, considering it shoots the most bullets.
[04:11.99]Nothing in there.
[04:13.34]Let's keep going on.
[04:14.80]See what we find upstairs in the dungeon.
[04:18.07]It's the military.
[04:19.37]I should have known.
[04:20.53]The secrets.
[04:21.27]They must want to sell them to some private industrial man.
[04:24.07]Not in my watch.
[04:25.39]You're not gonna take me.
[04:26.03]I'll get pretty shocking out here.
[04:27.89]Pick these coins too.
[04:29.61]It's all about the coins, guys.
[04:30.99]Gotta get as many coins as you can.
[04:32.75]So then people know how high your score is.
[04:35.55]What?
[04:35.97]Okay.
[04:36.85]There must be at least one.
[04:38.59]We're going to go with the more finesse weapon.
[04:40.57]Magnum.
[04:41.79]There's one down.
[04:42.93]Yep, I know that.
[04:43.89]I can see him.
[04:44.53]He was peeking over.
[04:45.31]He thought he was sneaky.
[04:46.17]He's not sneaky.
[04:47.55]I'll show you sneaky.
[04:48.43]That's a one-two.
[04:50.37]One-two, baby.
[04:51.59]That's a rocket!
[04:53.37]Get rid of this guy.
[04:53.93]Don't let him shoot another one.
[04:57.77]I should probably take this.
[04:59.31]You never know when you're going to need a rocket launcher.
[05:01.89]My old grandmother used to say.
[05:04.46]So, on to the cave system.
[05:07.94]Seems to have been dug out rather recently.
[05:10.42]The fresh smell of dirt is... I can't go down the stairs.
[05:14.19]I may have put these in wrong.
[05:16.13]But the mold and mildew caking the walls, and the slight crackling underneath my feet... It's one of the lesser demons!
[05:24.53]That is Algorro, the third lieutenant of the underworld!
[05:28.80]I don't stand a warrior's chance!
[05:34.77]That was really easy.
[05:37.75]Okay.
[05:38.71]Uh, I think we may have won.
[05:40.37]We may have beaten Castle Griffinsteed.
[05:43.55]I would assume that there's nothing left.
[05:45.09]That must have been the source of all the power.
[05:46.84]So let's make our exit.
[05:50.62]What the fuck is this?
[05:53.42]This is underneath Castle Griffinsteed?
[05:57.40]A whole land of strange things.
[06:00.88]Creatures and wildlife and vegetation I've never seen before.
[06:05.53]A harmless creature, it seems.
[06:07.61]But I must keep my wits about me if I'm to uncover the demonic presence underneath my old family's house.
[06:15.32]What's in here?
[06:18.14]Having lunch, I see.
[06:20.74]Creepy.
[06:21.21]We're going to continue on.
[06:24.23]Another place, another building.
[06:26.03]What is in this one?
[06:28.45]Oh, sharp!
[06:29.25]Oh, cool!
[06:29.87]I told you guys I was gonna need those coins!
[06:32.00]Okay, so we're gonna get... I'll take some potions from you, good sir.
[06:36.42]Your radar gun.
[06:38.08]I'm gonna switch to the shotgun for... Okay, it's time to go!
[06:43.02]I'm gonna go now.
[06:44.04]I don't really want to be here anymore.
[06:46.00]You guys are seriously creeping me out.
[06:48.20]We're going to leave.
[06:49.50]One more door to check, just for good measure, you know, we're gonna open it up.
[06:56.82]Get away from me!
[06:57.92]Get away from me, you vile creatures!
[06:59.64]You're not going to catch me!
[07:01.90]Get me out of here!
[07:02.76]I don't even want to be here anymore!
[07:05.29]Laser beams!
[07:06.49]How dare you shoot me!
[07:07.83]I gotta go.
[07:08.53]Time to run.
[07:09.37]It's time to get out of here.
[07:14.28]Another dungeon.
[07:15.68]It never ends.
[07:17.38]What else could I find under here?
[07:19.82]I thought I killed with demonic presence.
[07:21.88]But of course not.
[07:22.52]It's a zombie game now.
[07:23.72]Don't you know every game has to have zombies in 2015?
[07:27.37]What the hell is going on there?
[07:29.83]Alright.
[07:30.75]I can't be much further away from the final secret.
[07:33.39]I wonder...
[07:35.05]What is that?
[07:35.51]I just saw a hand!
[07:37.41]That must be Algulu!
[07:38.84]The giant demon!
[07:40.22]Stuck in the wall for all eternity!
[07:41.64]I've only heard stories about this!
[07:43.30]I must hide!
[07:44.14]Look at all these creatures!
[07:45.06]What the fuck was that?
[07:47.30]Oh my god, a barrel exploded!
[07:48.72]There's exploding barrels!
[07:49.82]There's bunnies!
[07:50.70]Laser beams everywhere!
[07:51.96]Gotta be careful.
[07:53.40]Aim down sights, just like in Call of Duty.
[07:55.46]I remember my grandmother taught me that secret of aim down sights.
[07:58.68]She would be so proud of me if she knew I was using it now.
[08:00.88]I must clear the rest.
[08:02.90]A few more soldiers.
[08:03.96]A few more zombies.
[08:05.58]What's that I hear?
[08:06.98]Oh no!
[08:07.88]He's getting ready to cast a giant spell!
[08:09.92]I must stop him!
[08:13.36]I must have fucked up his health, because he wasn't supposed to die like that.
[08:16.51]But that's it.
[08:17.79]The zombies are no longer pursuing.
[08:20.21]Have I made it to the final room?
[08:22.15]The final door?
[08:23.05]Will I uncover the secrets of my family name?
[08:26.59]And what is in here?
[08:29.53]Who is this?
[08:31.41]Welcome, Carl.
[08:33.23]It is I, your great times eighteen great grandfather.
[08:38.18]I can teach you all the secrets, for you are the only person to ever make it through the dungeon.
[08:45.26]So your choice is this.
[08:47.24]Come with me, or take this at least two months supply of chips.
[08:53.73]The choice is yours.
[08:55.61]I stand you will make the correct one.
[08:58.23]What do you want to know about your father?
[09:01.07]What about your grand- I kinda want the chips.
[09:06.64]Yeah, that's a lot of chips.
