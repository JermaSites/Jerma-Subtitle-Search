[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.19]No, it's alright.
[00:03.99]In the meantime, we're going to play something else.
[00:05.35]Don't worry.
[00:05.81]We're going to play... Not a great joke, but a solid zing.
[00:15.45]Until Dawn.
[00:16.05]I can't play Until Dawn.
[00:17.75]I have to set that up and turn my stream off for 40 minutes.
[00:23.17]That's the plan tomorrow.
[00:24.27]Tomorrow night, we're going to do Until Dawn.
[00:28.38]But yeah, GTA.
[00:29.60]Here we go.
[00:30.18]Here it comes.
[00:32.59]In the meantime, let's try this fucking stupid game.
[00:36.00]No, don't call it a stupid game.
[00:39.52]Don't call it a dumb game.
[00:40.34]I'm going to keep the title, though, by the way.
[00:44.40]I bought this game, and we're going to try it.
[00:52.03]Grab that auto.
[00:52.99]No.
[00:54.33]WowGTA 5 reinstalls, because this is a new computer.
[01:00.09]It is a stupid game.
[01:00.79]No, no, it's not stupid.
[01:01.91]It's like a psychological horror FPS scary game.
[01:05.78]It's by Bandai Namco.
[01:08.56]I think.
[01:10.94]Cover your ears because this might be loud.
[01:12.72]I just blocked it.
[01:13.92]Don't worry.
[01:17.35]Let's play a Flash game.
[01:23.31]I love the fact that I really, truly thought that that was going to be interesting.
[01:28.57]Oh, yeah!
[01:30.08]Let me play GTA with rules.
[01:31.84]Alright, here we go.
[01:39.76]Resident Evil 7 VR stream.
[01:42.95]This is not going to be Until Dawn.
[01:44.39]I have to get that ready.
[01:45.63]I have to capture that.
[01:46.63]Okay, hold on.
[01:51.69]It's really loud.
[01:52.69]I just saved you guys a lot of pain.
[01:57.26]Okay, this is actually fucking kind of funny.
[02:00.78]Hold on a second.
[02:01.46]Hold on.
[02:01.70]This is really important.
[02:06.51]Hold on.
[02:06.87]I'm coming back.
[02:08.31]This is a good joke right here.
[02:09.77]Let me change the name.
[02:15.72]I gotta take this off of Driver's Ed.
[02:20.26]Rules of the Road.
[02:21.62]And it's this game.
[02:26.62]Hell yeah, welcome to the rules of the road.
[02:30.39]So just be driver's ed, get even.
[02:32.09]Alright, let's do... No, no, no, this is actually a really funny joke.
[02:45.47]I don't know what the hell that even means.
[02:50.22]Turn this on like that.
[02:51.54]Alright, so here, this is get even.
[02:58.53]I do need to change the title though.
[03:05.13]Isn't this a fucking... Isn't Even Steven like a TV show?
[03:08.55]Even Steven Get Even.
[03:10.20]Okay, that's good.
[03:16.10]Turn this down a little bit.
[03:17.88]Just a little.
[03:19.66]Alright, so here's what I was going to say.
[03:20.64]This is what I was going to tell you.
[03:22.50]So we're going to go into audio options, right?
[03:26.24]I'm going to turn this down because it's fucking loud.
[03:30.78]Game options.
[03:32.22]This will just give you an indication.
[03:33.28]Difficulty.
[03:34.08]Traumatizing.
[03:36.72]That's the default one.
[03:38.74]Gentle or traumatizing.
[03:43.94]Why is traumatizing a difficulty?
[03:48.86]I guess we're going to keep it on.
[03:52.50]There you go.
[03:53.22]There it is.
[03:56.97]Gently traumatized.
[03:58.17]I have no idea what the fuck that means.
[04:03.37]Here we go.
[04:04.41]We're gonna play this for a little while.
[04:06.33]This one might, you know, you never know.
[04:07.37]This might be like a gem.
[04:09.45]Do our video options.
[04:11.68]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:12.38]We have a fucking supercomputer.
[04:13.80]No motion blur, though.
[04:19.28]Gamma options to make sure we get this correct.
[04:23.16]That's better.
[04:23.68]There we go.
[04:26.04]Get even.
[04:31.40]Here we go.
[04:31.78]Uh, diamond in the rough.
[04:34.10]It could be.
[04:34.58]Uh, enjoy.
[04:35.52]There's probably a cutscene coming up.
[04:36.74]We're gonna be quiet here.
[04:38.48]New game on traumatizing.
[04:40.42]You will confront the memories head on, no matter how painful and stressful.
[04:45.52]Gentle.
[04:45.86]You will experience your memories more safely.
[04:50.71]These, these, I don't understand these.
[04:53.29]Does this one mean it's like less scary?
[04:54.79]This one's like more scary?
[04:58.28]Okay, well, I guess we're just going to keep it like that.
[05:00.36]Okay, here's your cutscene.
[05:01.53]I have no idea.
[05:02.27]It's fucking so low.
[05:12.60]Even Steven gets traumatized.
[05:13.62]Time to get even.
[05:14.24]I'm gonna give the game a chance.
[05:40.67]Okay.
[05:40.95]Some type of weird psychological horror.
[05:45.45]Okay.
[05:51.75]Multiple faces.
[05:52.83]These are memories that I've had at some point.
[05:55.15]Okay.
[05:57.51]Okay.
[06:01.51]Black, stay away from the hand oversight.
[06:03.27]We have the girl.
[06:03.97]You cannot save her.
[06:04.83]Let it run its course.
[06:07.51]Let me get a closer look.
[06:08.59]Save the girl.
[06:09.57]Save the girl.
[06:11.65]Why do I need to look that close?
[06:15.62]You're putting that right in front of your face.
[06:17.20]That looks odd.
[06:19.52]Controls can be reviewed in the pause menu.
[06:21.26]We aren't going to review them because the sensitivity is way too high.
[06:29.12]Mouse sensitivity.
[06:30.09]You're going to drop that by like 14 or so.
[06:34.31]Smooth mouse.
[06:34.91]Get that shit out of here.
[06:35.81]I don't want none of that crap.
[06:39.88]Let's see how that is.
[06:41.64]What about the field of view slider?
[06:43.02]Do they have one?
[06:43.70]If they have one, is it getting turned on?
[06:44.86]We've got to make these important decisions first.
[06:52.02]I don't think there's any there.
[06:53.72]Make sure it's not in the game options or controls.
[06:58.77]Game options, make sure.
[06:59.93]And controls.
[07:03.25]Was it there?
[07:03.67]There.
[07:06.94]General, advanced, mouse, I think it is just 90.
[07:12.79]Let's go.
[07:13.11]Nice, so we're supposed to stay away from something in particular.
[07:18.85]I don't know exactly what that is.
[07:20.25]Does this phone also act as a gun?
[07:25.76]I don't know.
[07:26.44]Okay, F is interact.
[07:32.13]Okay.
[07:33.70]Do I have a weapon?
[07:35.32]Oh, okay!
[07:38.38]Well, no, you really got the psychological horror here.
[07:42.22]Start me off with a phone, and oh, by the way, I have a fucking assault rifle, too!
[07:48.51]Okay, what the fuck?
[07:52.99]Well, this is like Call of Duty, apparently.
[07:59.52]Let's move.
[08:01.58]Should I open this door, too?
[08:03.89]I thought this was gonna be one of those... Examine your surroundings, be careful, watch out for the ghost!
[08:09.28]No, you just have a fucking assault rifle.
[08:11.46]Who's shooting me?
[08:14.20]What the fuck is happening?
[08:15.04]What is the context here?
[08:19.36]What the fuck is going on?
[08:20.68]Okay.
[08:27.59]I... The bush was shooting me.
[08:29.97]I was getting shot by the ghost.
[08:34.42]I like this game.
[08:40.82]This game's fucking awesome.
[08:41.80]Okay, so hide behind the dumpster first.
[08:44.14]Is there a crouch?
[08:48.25]Okay, yeah, there is a crouch.
[08:52.67]I don't know where I'm supposed to be going.
[08:54.63]But I'm telling you right now, guys, I'm fucking traumatized.
[08:58.31]Anybody else feeling, like, super traumatized right now?
[09:03.51]Sneak around.
[09:03.99]I'm sneaking on that bush.
[09:08.77]Use the silence gun?
[09:09.79]That's a fucking good idea.
[09:10.95]Alright, let's find out which one of these bushes is shooting me.
[09:16.90]Um, nobody here.
[09:29.63]I already hate the head Bob.
[09:33.33]What is that?
[09:33.89]I keep hearing... You guys keep hearing that noise?
[09:36.13]First of all, let me turn this up for you guys.
[09:37.37]I feel like it's a little too low.
[09:38.45]Let's go there.
[09:41.67]That might be better.
[09:43.15]Better?
[09:43.35]Is that good?
[09:44.95]Can you guys, like, hear me and the game?
[09:46.69]Are we good?
[09:50.52]I keep hearing, like, a big key turn into a door.
[09:54.06]You hear that, right?
[09:58.52]Oh, there was somebody... There was something in here shooting me.
[10:04.68]Not anymore, apparently.
[10:07.76]Is that the psychological part of it?
[10:10.55]What the fuck?
[10:11.15]They keep making that noise.
[10:13.73]Oh, I hear lightning.
[10:18.55]Equip your phone.
[10:22.45]Why would I want to equip my phone?
[10:23.63]Oh, God.
[10:25.59]Uh, UV light memoir.
[10:27.31]Scanner.
[10:28.52]Vision.
[10:29.48]Alright, let's take out the scanner.
[10:34.05]Okay, I fucking love this game.
[10:36.33]No evidence found.
[10:37.19]We have to find evidence?
[10:38.13]Evidence of what?
[10:41.26]Evidence of the mysterious person opening the door with the key?
[10:46.78]Scan this.
[10:48.18]Scan this for possible fucking intrusion.
[10:50.46]No.
[10:52.32]What about this?
[10:52.70]Scan this.
[10:53.30]Some fucking, like, some fucking, some hooligans were, like, painting graffiti.
[10:57.61]What about over here?
[10:59.47]Green lights on the side of your phone guide you towards nearby evidence.
[11:04.25]Okay.
[11:04.77]Evidence in here?
[11:07.01]Oh, shit.
[11:07.51]Try scanning the broken drone.
[11:15.83]Got it.
[11:18.52]What?
[11:19.56]Oh, that thing.
[11:20.48]That thing.
[11:22.78]White frame turned green.
[11:24.58]Alt begins the analysis.
[11:25.58]If I could scan that, please.
[11:35.51]Okay.
[11:37.39]What else can I do on my phone?
[11:39.63]Hey, do I have angry birds?
[11:42.78]Let's see what kind of dirty shit they have in their house.
[11:54.96]Let's skip the skip.
[11:56.00]Vision.
[12:02.69]What a quality joke.
[12:04.66]This door doesn't open.
[12:06.28]Oh, I can do this.
[12:10.72]Okay, so I got that.
[12:16.42]Now what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[12:18.38]Do I have any objectives?
[12:19.44]Okay.
[12:21.06]That's like a real person.
[12:24.60]Alright.
[12:25.58]Save the girl.
[12:27.31]We have to save the girl.
[12:29.91]I'm gonna, like, flip over.
[12:30.75]There's gonna be a bunch of pictures of, like, my penis on here.
[12:36.13]Well, I have the new evidence.
[12:37.19]It's lighting up.
[12:38.18]Gotta get my evidence scanner out.
[12:39.30]Okay, where's the evidence?
[12:45.24]Alright, this is gonna make me throw up.
[12:49.86]I'm seeing, like, two different things at the same time.
[12:56.35]I'm making, like, a really shitty video.
[12:59.40]Oh, okay, this is rope.
[13:01.26]Scan that.
[13:05.12]No evidence found.
[13:06.16]What the fuck are you talking about?
[13:15.53]Yeah?
[13:17.05]That's all I used to say, shit.
[13:20.49]Should I pull out the other thing and, like, blacklight this?
[13:23.85]Ooh, wait a minute.
[13:25.79]Look at that.
[13:27.19]This, uh...
[13:29.18]There's blood here.
[13:32.60]Look, goes over here.
[13:34.68]Into this spot.
[13:36.10]Take out the scanner.
[13:39.26]Right here.
[13:40.42]Told you guys.
[13:41.72]Just call me fucking Detective Jerma.
[13:48.81]If I hear that fucking noise one more time... I'm going to scream.
[13:59.78]Okay, UV light.
[14:00.78]Here's another one.
[14:01.96]Okay, thank you for telling me how to switch between apps quickly, because, like, fuck, that's annoying.
[14:08.82]Alright, uh, there was something right here, right?
[14:14.02]Right there.
[14:20.12]Well, alright, let's just go.
[14:26.41]Cigarettes?
[14:27.23]Sure.
[14:28.03]Whatever.
[14:32.83]Uh, here's another light.
[14:34.55]Should I scan this?
[14:37.07]Dude, I fucking hate when games, like, give you this up.
[14:38.91]Alright, there's somebody out.
[14:40.79]How do I take out the gun?
[14:46.13]Better keep quiet.
[14:48.75]Takedowns are quick and stealthy, but they can be executed at close range.
[14:51.47]Wait, there's a per- Oh, shit!
[15:00.65]What did I shoot him with?
[15:03.85]Did I shoot a Bluetooth into his ear?
[15:08.61]Is that it?
[15:09.77]Scan him.
[15:16.58]Ah, you know, if I can look at his body.
[15:19.84]This dude had a fucking bad headache.
[15:22.11]You can tell all the blood up there.
[15:23.11]And he has like painful shoulders.
[15:24.23]He has arthritis in his hands.
[15:27.49]Fucking scan this guy.
[15:33.25]What was he shooting at?
[15:34.17]Good fucking question.
[15:36.23]Nothing.
[15:40.55]I think he was just doing target practice to this thing.
[15:45.24]Whatever.
[15:45.52]I think that's all I can do.
[15:54.93]Any more evidence?
[15:59.11]Apparently, there's evidence here.
[16:02.25]Somewhere down here.
[16:04.30]Or maybe not.
[16:06.16]Yeah.
[16:07.08]Alright, well here... Shit, I gotta put this down.
[16:14.02]No, stop looking at pictures of your fucking, like, girlfriend.
[16:18.10]Select the map app.
[16:21.46]All moving objects are marked on the map.
[16:23.72]Okay.
[16:30.36]Alright, where am I?
[16:31.83]So they're up the stairs?
[16:34.59]Okay.
[16:39.05]Do I need to go find these people?
[16:45.19]That noise, honest to fucking god.
[16:53.18]Where's the facecam?
[16:55.28]Uh, no facecam for this fucking game.
[16:59.76]I can't leave.
[17:02.22]Why can't I leave?
[17:08.42]Okay.
[17:10.26]Oh, I love her so much.
[17:11.46]I always have to have a picture of her on my phone here.
[17:14.09]Looks like we're going this way.
[17:28.66]No, I'm locked down here.
[17:32.64]We have to get you traumatized.
[17:33.84]I know, right?
[17:37.64]Alright, there's a mercenary here.
[17:39.69]Let me check out my echo locator.
[17:45.55]No, let's see.
[17:46.19]Let's find out where they are.
[17:51.09]Alright, there's two guys right down this hall.
[17:54.56]I'm gonna run right into them, apparently.
[17:56.04]I mean, am I?
[17:59.30]Who the fuck is this guy?
[18:08.89]Apparently they're gone.
[18:15.32]This game just has fucking noise making on it.
[18:18.10]This is a noise machine.
[18:19.38]Alright, here we go.
[18:25.69]There's the ghost.
[18:29.87]Why are they always just barely out of sight?
[18:34.09]Where the fuck am I going?
[18:41.64]What is this noise?
[18:43.64]Am I inside of a washing machine?
[18:49.47]Why is that such a big deal?
[18:52.61]What?
[18:53.33]Where did I get this?
[18:55.55]I can't move.
[18:56.07]What?
[18:59.81]What is... What the fuck did I just do?
[19:02.69]How did I shoot that guy?
[19:13.06]Okay.
[19:18.01]That was fucking amazing.
[19:21.29]Now what?
[19:23.47]The corner gun.
[19:24.39]Okay, got it.
[19:29.04]Evidence or something?
[19:29.94]I don't know.
[19:30.82]Maybe I should use the corner gun.
[19:36.02]Nope.
[19:39.74]I better use the corner gun to take these guys out.
[19:43.34]I'm gonna have to use the corner gun, huh?
[19:52.17]What?
[19:52.91]What's happening?
[19:55.15]Wait, oh, it's slow motion.
[20:01.27]Oh no!
[20:02.21]I can't seem to hit him!
[20:03.97]And she's doing the Matrix thing!
[20:05.93]Oh shit!
[20:17.99]I just unloaded a clip into that person.
[20:27.42]Bad ending.
[20:29.70]Oh god.
[20:34.13]Apparently I didn't do it.
[20:35.29]I don't know.
[20:42.56]Am I going to have to start over again?
[20:46.64]No.
[20:49.72]Save the bomb.
[20:54.09]There was a bomb.
[20:56.67]There was a bomb.
[20:57.51]I got it.
[20:59.99]Where the bloody fucking hell am I?
[21:02.49]No.
[21:03.97]Oh, I have really large hands.
[21:06.25]This guy's hands are fucking huge.
[21:08.53]What are you doing?
[21:13.06]I'm waiting in Building B as agreed.
[21:14.58]Okay.
[21:14.68]This is 2015, by the way.
[21:16.66]This game's in development for a very long time.
[21:33.42]This game was in development like three years ago.
[21:38.78]You can tell by the fucking phone.
[21:41.92]Give me one sec.
[21:43.96]I want to just check something real quick.
[21:50.12]Bear with me for one second here, guys.
[21:55.39]Give me one second here, guys.
[22:04.15]Just one second.
[22:10.82]One second here.
[22:21.11]Hold on.
[22:32.31]Okay, let me just like, I gotta change the FOV.
[22:35.67]There's apparently a way for me to fix it.
[22:37.59]There is no joke here.
[22:38.43]I just like, I'm starting to, I can see this is like 70 FOV and there's a way to change it.
[22:43.01]So just give me one second here, boys and girls.
[22:48.61]We'll get right back into this.
[22:52.11]We made it to a checkpoint, so we're good.
[22:54.03]Just give me one second while I change this.
[22:55.81]Apparently it's very easy.
[22:57.96]So give me a second.
[23:00.61]I'm going to be fucking so mad if this don't work.
[23:04.91]But, give me one sec.
[23:06.70]We will get right back into this here.
[23:08.00]Just look at the funny guy peeing into the toilet.
[23:10.10]Be right back.
[25:10.80]Alright, let's see if that did it.
[25:14.56]Let's see if that did it.
[25:17.06]I'm gonna hope so.
[25:19.02]If not, then I'm just gonna have to deal with, like, 80 FOV.
[25:21.28]It's alright, gonna have to deal with it.
[25:24.38]Here we go.
[25:27.00]It's just, uh, you know, you know, sometimes you gotta change shit.
[25:29.84]You know what I'm saying?
[25:32.24]Let's move this back.
[25:36.22]Get even!
[25:38.18]here we are here comes the clown car no no the clown car is not here no clown car must the game be like completely broken I would laugh so sorry about that just really wanted to make sure if it's possible to have an fob that's not awful
[26:08.14]Let's see.
[26:08.80]Okay.
[26:10.62]Then you should put us like right here.
[26:14.04]Did I break it?
[26:14.64]I hope not.
[26:16.20]I don't think I did.
[26:17.36]It looked like a very easy change.
[26:21.30]And let's see.
[26:23.31]Did it change?
[26:29.19]It may have.
[26:30.37]It may have changed.
[26:32.17]I don't know.
[26:38.68]Maybe for a pro FOV.
[26:43.78]I don't remember this place.
[26:45.76]What the fuck is going on?
[26:49.36]Looking any different?
[26:50.26]I think it may have changed.
[26:52.38]It did.
[26:53.44]We're good to go.
[26:55.02]Building B. Everyone pretend like that didn't happen because the FOV is no.
[26:58.02]Better it's 90.
[27:00.32]Fuck yeah!
[27:01.22]So we need to go to building B. Wherever that is.
[27:05.98]This is building A. That makes it really easy.
[27:13.97]Point of interest.
[27:15.35]Bartholomew the angel.
[27:16.33]Okay, building B. No, there was no joke.
[27:21.90]I just didn't want to have anybody puke.
[27:23.96]Where's building B?
[27:24.68]Okay, building B is like a church.
[27:31.20]Alright.
[27:31.82]Building B. Meet me in building B. You got it.
[27:33.54]Do I have any guns?
[27:36.30]Okay, I don't have any weapons.
[27:38.30]So that's good.
[27:41.48]Make sure we take... That's a guy's arm.
[27:43.54]Okay.
[27:47.37]Evidence.
[27:47.73]There's evidence inside of here somewhere.
[27:54.47]Nope, no evidence found.
[27:57.07]The bed?
[28:02.98]The hand.
[28:05.24]This is just condemned criminal origins.
[28:08.26]Except not condemned criminal origins.
[28:10.36]Okay, let's keep going.
[28:15.35]Oh, TV.
[28:20.87]Let's see what it says.
[28:25.76]Oh, never mind.
[28:28.68]Now they're playing scary music.
[28:29.76]That means something bad is going to happen here soon.
[28:37.80]It's just a bunch of guys' hands.
[28:40.56]Not anything too scary.
[28:44.42]Why do I have a super-powered iPhone?
[28:46.62]Why would they leave me with my super-powered iPhone if I'm having scary memories or something?
[28:50.92]I don't know.
[28:53.38]The evidence is lighting up.
[28:59.92]Anything in here?
[29:01.02]No.
[29:02.01]Doesn't look like it.
[29:04.53]There's a thermostat, though.
[29:09.57]Uh... Is there hiding in this game?
[29:15.63]Somebody just, like, cut a bunch of people's arms off and put them in closets.
[29:19.84]That'll be real scary.
[29:21.06]Gonna slice off a bunch of people's arms.
[29:26.24]And those are going right into the closet.
[29:28.88]Drugs won't help.
[29:31.48]Oh, a code.
[29:32.68]I gotta scan that code, right?
[29:35.74]It's gonna open up, like, Snapchat.
[29:37.78]Yeah.
[29:45.77]Think we found our little secret Fuck's sake come on But what am I irritated at the fact that I had to do that well, we're gonna follow the footsteps obviously And they went to the window they looked outside and turned this way they went down here the fucking plasma ghost went down here and
[30:10.62]Now like it's that we're getting we're getting matrix II again.
[30:12.62]Yeah, I'm starting to lose battery I'm gonna have to use the thermal cam, right?
[30:25.20]Scaries yep is the laughing girl.
[30:28.69]Oh
[30:31.78]Right after receiving a text, press to open it immediately.
[30:34.22]You have a new text.
[30:35.78]This is all your fault.
[30:36.74]Okay.
[30:37.32]This is all your fault.
[30:38.20]What was his name?
[30:40.27]Ethan.
[30:42.03]It's all your fault, Ethan.
[30:49.58]I can't wait for a manly scream.
[31:03.10]What?
[31:04.42]Of course.
[31:06.60]Go turn off a fuse box.
[31:08.36]Look it.
[31:13.51]I already knew what the fuck I was doing.
[31:17.43]Alright.
[31:17.99]There we go.
[31:18.77]Breaker.
[31:19.19]Just gotta go to the fuse box.
[31:20.41]You guys didn't think I was smart?
[31:23.53]Just gotta find- gotta trace the wire back to where the fuse box is.
[31:27.85]And that's how you- I should just be- I should be doing this.
[31:30.97]Oh, I'm walking into walls.
[31:34.34]This way.
[31:34.90]There's another one of those monkeys from that last game we played.
[31:45.14]Higher than- what a higher than average IQ.
[31:48.42]And here?
[31:52.73]Where the fuck did it go?
[31:53.43]Over here.
[31:57.51]I can't see anything.
[32:04.48]There it is.
[32:06.08]Please don't tell me there's going to be some dumb puzzle that I don't want to do.
[32:10.92]Oh, God.
[32:17.37]I don't think it worked.
[32:26.24]Come on!
[32:27.02]I don't want to sit here and do this.
[32:28.32]There's some stupid thing to do.
[32:31.66]Does it have to... Do I have to, like, examine these or something?
[32:36.63]Alright.
[32:36.89]Alright, what the fuck does this mean?
[32:44.13]What?
[32:47.11]What?
[32:50.63]Okay, this one goes on first.
[32:53.92]Then this one.
[32:56.02]Then this one.
[32:58.62]And I did it.
[33:00.82]Okay.
[33:01.42]Congratulations.
[33:03.38]Your actions will have consequences.
[33:04.98]Oh, well now... The consequence is... I just turned on the lights.
[33:11.53]Oh my god.
[33:21.09]I actually am, like, kind of scared right now.
[33:22.89]Like, I... We made a lot of fucking gaffes in the very beginning of this.
[33:26.87]And now I can hear something running around down here.
[33:28.57]Is it gonna be, like, scary?
[33:32.60]Ah, I knew it.
[33:38.58]That's not that scary.
[33:44.76]It was kind of scary.
[33:51.78]There's apparently evidence in here.
[33:52.96]This is me.
[33:54.80]What's going on?
[33:56.32]Hello?
[33:57.77]Anyone there?
[33:59.55]Hey!
[33:59.81]I love how he's screaming this.
[34:04.51]Why was he there?
[34:05.43]I don't know.
[34:08.71]That's the first thing you do?
[34:09.65]If you're like locked in a house and it's really scary and you think somebody's chasing you or somebody's trying to get you, what the fuck are you doing screaming if anybody's there?
[34:22.70]Why would you do that?
[34:23.36]Upon leaving the military, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:29.02]Somebody read that at some point.
[34:33.02]Alright, back up.
[34:35.37]Yeah, yeah, let's get the picture of the evidence wherever the fuck it is.
[34:37.97]Alright, um... Somebody drew something on the wall.
[34:44.91]No, what is this evidence?
[34:49.37]That it says it's like over here.
[34:54.77]I don't get it.
[34:56.37]What is it?
[35:02.76]Where is it?
[35:03.88]It's not this.
[35:07.96]Oh, you fucking idiot.
[35:09.38]Of course.
[35:10.04]Yeah.
[35:11.38]And here comes the fucking monster.
[35:19.18]Now that's me...
[35:21.65]Please, apologies for the theatrics.
[35:24.90]It's all part of the treatment.
[35:26.42]Treatment?
[35:27.20]This will be far more straightforward if you just keep breathing.
[35:31.90]Keep breathing, like me.
[35:33.56]It's helium.
[35:34.18]That's it.
[35:34.46]Good.
[35:36.52]Oh, no!
[35:39.24]Scan that.
[35:40.24]Scan that.
[35:42.42]I'm going to take that into evidence.
[35:44.05]Somebody scan that.
[36:02.98]I've done a lot of waking up in this game, I've noticed.
[36:05.80]Oh shit, it's virtual reality.
[36:06.80]This is all just a shitty VR game.
[36:08.86]We want you to try Minecraft VR.
[36:10.34]All very unfortunate, but I assure you, you are in safe hands.
[36:32.49]Time to get even.
[36:33.13]It's time to get even.
[36:34.17]Yep.
[36:34.33]This is like Saw.
[36:58.54]What happened to the subtitle?
[37:01.02]Fine, I'll break all your TVs.
[37:02.44]Ah, fuck, I only have nine bolts.
[37:03.77]This is just rust.
[37:27.05]Alright, let's go.
[37:28.19]Here we go.
[37:28.61]Do I still have my phone?
[37:34.44]More dump scanning.
[37:36.46]VR helmet.
[37:43.56]This is going to turn out to be some VR evil thing, right?
[37:46.88]Can't go this way, this way.
[37:55.44]Who cares about all these fucking beers?
[37:57.15]Let's just go.
[37:59.85]You can equip smartphone.
[38:02.25]Who's talking?
[38:05.27]Oh, these are all the VR test subjects.
[38:10.49]Okay.
[38:11.53]Okay.
[38:24.84]I tried, and you know, it didn't work.
[38:27.22]Well, this guy's playing bed simulator.
[38:33.89]This guy is sleeping in a VR game while he's sleeping in real life.
[38:40.64]He's getting way too real.
[38:43.68]Either that, or he's playing one of those, like, witch sex games.
[38:46.44]I'm not so sure.
[38:55.76]This guy's on a swing.
[38:57.44]See, he's having fun.
[38:58.84]He's on a virtual swing.
[39:00.07]I don't want to take that away from him.
[39:03.89]Alright, fine.
[39:06.33]How do I open the door?
[39:07.19]Alright, who do I let out?
[39:15.55]Which one was he?
[39:16.03]He was this one.
[39:17.85]Alright, that should do it, right?
[39:27.14]He's gonna get grabbed and eaten.
[39:33.76]Remember, your actions will have consequences.
[39:36.22]Right?
[39:41.06]So that guy's gonna come back to get me.
[39:42.79]I know.
[39:43.61]All your actions have consequences.
[39:45.19]I get it.
[39:45.61]I think there's something here to look at.
[39:54.83]Maybe not.
[39:57.54]I don't like this, like, I'm being taken out of the game.
[40:01.94]Yeah, Clementine will remember that.
[40:13.13]Kenny didn't like what you just said.
[40:15.99]Except, guess what?
[40:16.91]It don't fucking matter anyways.
[40:20.41]Every decision in these Telltale games leads up to the same, like...
[40:27.31]Here's my consequences.
[40:31.93]That's it.
[40:33.73]That's it.
[40:37.99]He was too busy playing Half-Life VR.
[40:41.17]He got too into it.
[40:42.07]I shot him.
[40:42.97]And he was so into the game that he didn't even matter.
[40:45.83]I told you to ignore them, Mr. Black.
[40:48.57]If the treatment is to succeed, I need your cooperation.
[40:51.75]Yeah.
[40:55.03]See, he's like Gordon Freeman right now.
[41:06.98]I missed way too many times.
[41:08.98]I kind of want to die.
[41:09.78]Can I pick up the fucking wrench?
[41:18.44]Your actions have consequences.
[41:20.66]You let the guy out of his cell and he tried to murder you with a fucking pool cue.
[41:28.14]I told you that you have to take this guy's voice what are we looking at if you die in the game you it's over for you in real life too and that's 50 bucks speaking of which I haven't been I gotta like pay attention like bits for a minute here first let me like light this place up and see if there's anything
[41:52.81]I don't think I can do anything right now.
[41:54.89]Uh, thank you, Stix Renegade, for the $50.
[41:56.29]$50.
[41:56.31]Do you remember Do the Walk?
[42:00.25]Do the Walk of Life.
[42:01.16]The Virtual Walk of Life.
[42:04.78]Can you just finish your stupid GTA joke?
[42:08.16]I don't know, man.
[42:09.24]Like, I'm kind of getting interested in this one.
[42:13.35]I mean, we're at the cusp of, like, interesting at the moment.
[42:21.72]So I'm okay with staying in here for a little while longer.
[42:25.67]But thank you so much, Sticks Renegade, for the $50.
[42:28.67]Also, also, it needs to be said, thank you to the 1700s, Custy15, Garrett0426, good guy, Ty.

[42:43.74]Ultraviolet for the $5 as well.
[42:47.04]Awesome, Alec, thank you for the bits.
[42:49.84]And then somebody just came in.
[42:50.85]Never Trust a Purple just came in, of course.
[42:53.97]One of our moderators of the YouTube and Twitch spheres.
[42:59.43]Or Twitch, you know.
[43:00.19]You get it.
[43:02.31]Why did I scan that?
[43:03.02]10 bucks, thank you.
[43:05.72]Stream has really gone downhill since you lost a star in Lethal League and had to sing him a song.
[43:12.32]Well, we were already way downhill after that one.
[43:14.91]Before that.
[43:15.43]I said, where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[43:20.83]What's my objectives?
[43:22.99]A bomb, a girl, a whole black guy.
[43:24.73]I'm supposed to save her.
[43:25.53]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[43:28.27]How are we doing on scanning?
[43:31.78]I guess I have to go past him again?
[43:33.96]Where's the magic TV that's supposed to tell me what to do?
[43:38.52]I guess we're going this way.
[43:42.15]Although your memory has been affected, your Twitch response remains intact.
[43:45.69]Oh, my Twitch for TV response.
[43:48.69]Fascinating.
[43:49.79]What is this?
[43:51.13]Place is filled with runaways, criminals, ex-military.
[43:54.15]Who the fuck am I?
[43:55.31]And why the fuck am I armed?
[43:57.27]I understand your curiosity.
[43:58.91]Oh, he's pissed.
[43:59.23]There will be time for questions later, Mr. Black.
[44:02.23]Please proceed.
[44:03.67]Please proceed.
[44:06.37]What's this?
[44:08.03]What is that?
[44:08.52]Locked.
[44:09.24]Of course it is.
[44:10.52]Okay.
[44:13.20]Series of VR tests.
[44:15.28]There's another crazy person.
[44:16.40]Let's see.
[44:17.26]I turned the thermostat.
[44:20.20]What are you talking about?
[44:22.14]I turned the thermostat.
[44:37.02]I love this game.
[44:37.54]I love this game.
[44:38.52]I love all this consequence bullshit.
[44:39.88]It's fucking awesome.
[44:40.58]Hold on.
[44:40.84]I need to turn the fucking subtitles back on.
[45:07.45]I don't know how they turned off.
[45:10.41]There we go.
[45:11.45]Okay, so I turned the thermostat.
[45:17.14]Oh, that was connected to the electrical device that you disabled before.
[45:20.12]So he died.
[45:21.44]Alright.
[45:24.66]You got it.
[45:28.10]Who cares about evidence?
[45:29.02]I just want to progress.
[45:30.22]Okay.
[45:30.42]You guys remember the talkback from Home Alone?
[45:32.82]Who had one of those?
[45:54.55]The, hi kids, we're home early.
[45:57.62]Who's old enough to know what that is?
[46:00.04]Because this is somebody with a talkback that is just going up and down playing with the shitty setting to make it sound like that.
[46:06.30]I used to do this with the talkback.
[46:08.22]That's all this is.
[46:13.70]Alright, the TV's done talking to me.
[46:16.14]I'm like loading or something.
[46:18.86]There's a lot of assets loading in the background right now.
[46:23.66]Because, like, this is frame rates going all over the place.
[46:29.40]Ah, the Pandora is reacting.
[46:31.94]Keep your eyes locked and focused.
[46:33.94]Looking at a painting.
[46:34.70]What the fuck is going on?
[46:40.49]Very good.
[46:41.95]Just relax and allow that image to take you back there.
[46:45.43]You may feel a little disorientated at first.
[46:48.25]Disorientated?
[46:49.21]The building in the photo is the headquarters for Advanced Defense Strategy, or ADS.
[46:57.05]They are, or should I say were, the UK's leading weapons manufacturer.
[47:01.89]They were developing a weapon known as the Corner Gun.
[47:04.95]The Corner Gun.
[47:09.46]Or this is like two people standing next to each other.
[47:12.34]One of them keeps cutting the other one off.
[47:14.66]Like it's this guy and his son.
[47:16.88]And he's like, you probably remember.
[47:18.52]And the kid puts his hand up like shit and goes, the Corner Gun.
[47:23.35]Porno gun Incoming call.
[47:26.69]What the fuck just happened?
[47:28.29]What's going on with my graphics?
[47:29.81]Is this real?
[47:30.91]The answer is slightly more complex than the question, I'm afraid, Mr. Black.
[47:36.68]It's real enough.
[47:38.70]For now.
[47:39.86]Just relax and explore.
[47:42.02]Okay.
[47:43.69]Okay.
[47:44.69]Still the prototype.
[47:47.48]Internet is going down Internet is going down guys
[48:16.63]We gotta ride this out.
[48:17.69]Hold on.
[48:20.09]Yeah.
[48:21.01]Steal the fucking Comcast gun.
[48:25.05]The Comcast data fire.
[48:26.53]I think we're okay at the moment.
[48:32.07]We're not gone yet.
[48:34.55]It's the GTA in the background.
[48:36.11]Let's check that.
[48:36.99]Let's see.
[48:40.09]No, it's not GTA.
[48:42.64]It's not GTA.
[48:43.86]GTA is paused at the moment.
[48:50.30]uh well currently having issues with the internet remember guys uh once every two months comcast doesn't decides to stop working for like four days so let's just hang out here for a sec this is where we are having trouble that is certain that is certain
[49:17.10]Listen to that.
[49:17.64]It's like... Let's pause this for a minute.
[49:25.74]Let me just go over here and make sure nothing's going on in the background.
[49:29.97]Who fucking knows?
[49:32.51]Close every single possible thing.
[49:37.77]This one closed.
[49:38.73]This one closed.
[49:41.53]Uh-oh.
[49:59.55]uh oh we're still here I'm still technically here I mean I I it's going up and down but I mean I'm just gonna chill for like a few minutes
[50:24.47]We're going to hang out.
[50:25.17]This is going everywhere.
[50:27.57]Let me do a test.
[50:30.11]Just to make sure of something.
[50:31.69]Bear with me.
[50:33.51]Sorry about this.
[50:39.19]What's that called?
[50:42.65]Comcast Internet is a piece of garbage?
[50:46.01]Yeah.
[50:46.73]I know it's something like that.
[50:49.87]Let's find out.
[50:50.73]Let's see what's going on.
[50:52.86]Let's do a speed test and find out how terrible this is.
[50:58.06]Don't leave us.
[50:58.72]I'm trying not to.
[51:00.00]I'm trying to stay here.
[51:08.97]Get your combs ready.
[51:19.15]LOL R.I.P.
[51:22.57]It is not having a good time.
[51:24.83]I'll just say that.
[51:31.38]Speed test is going to crash the stream.
[51:32.96]You know, it might.
[51:34.78]But, you know, complain stream two with a mortal redneck.
[51:43.20]Give me a sec.
[51:43.98]Something's just not right.
[51:49.21]Hold on.
[51:52.52]This is like freaking the fuck out.
[52:00.14]It's kind of just like it's like locking up.
[52:02.42]It's weird.
[52:06.49]Um.
[52:08.91]One second here, guys.
[52:09.85]I need to do something.
[52:14.21]What happens when I do this?
[52:20.47]I'm going to turn this off.
[52:22.15]Let's see if that helps me.
[52:26.43]Okay, um, are we still dropping frames right now?
[52:28.69]I don't think we are.
[52:33.22]No, no, we are not.
[52:35.16]Okay, so, uh, guys... Oddly enough... The, uh... The game... I don't know why.
[52:45.86]Choices matter, apparently.
[52:47.10]Having that game opened is... Apparently killed my fucking internet.
[52:53.83]I don't know.
[52:55.01]That was really weird.
[52:57.69]I'm looking over, I don't see any, like, I'm looking over, it's all green.
[53:04.31]Uh, so let's try opening the game again.
[53:08.67]That is very odd.
[53:12.89]Hmm, okay.
[53:14.33]Let's see what happens.
[53:17.61]Virus game.
[53:18.23]Yeah, and it's not even using, it's using like 24% of my CPU.
[53:24.29]It's like killing my internet.
[53:29.14]Because my... Oh my lord, what the fuck is this?
[53:35.98]This game might have a fucking weird memory leak into my network drivers.
[53:40.79]That was odd.
[53:41.99]Okay.
[53:43.77]Let's try this again. ...
[53:55.50]Alright.
[53:57.20]Let's just, like, drop the graphics a little bit, even though that's not the problem.
[54:00.32]My CPU usage is at, like, 24%.
[54:04.33]But just because, I don't want to have, like, a fucking memory leak.
[54:09.23]Let's go with, like... Let's go with, like, fucking 2.
[54:15.11]Go shadows, like, low, or, like, medium.
[54:19.62]V-sync, get that fucking out of here.
[54:21.12]Smooth frame rate, no.
[54:24.10]Like, let's just go, like, high.
[54:25.58]If it's the games, it's the games problem.
[54:28.30]But let's just do this.
[54:30.12]Oh, that looks awful.
[54:31.30]What the fuck happened?
[54:32.48]What did I do?
[54:36.19]What the fuck?
[54:40.13]I just turned it into, like, a cigarette game.
[54:41.77]This is just cigarette ash.
[54:43.89]Who cares?
[54:44.37]Let's just see if we can play.
[54:46.69]Okay, here we go.
[54:49.49]Let's see if we start, like, dropping frames again.
[54:55.14]We good?
[54:58.14]What the fuck just happened?
[54:59.30]This looks so much different.
[55:01.41]The answer is slightly more complex than the question.
[55:06.47]It's real enough.
[55:07.51]I think there's like a weird issue.
[55:09.49]Just relax and explore.
[55:11.63]There's a weird issue with this game.
[55:13.11]Because it just killed my internet.
[55:15.60]Steal the prototype.
[55:18.00]Yeah, why did this turn like this?
[55:19.88]Hold on.
[55:20.08]Let's go to video options again.
[55:21.14]What did I turn off that made this look so awful?
[55:46.63]Graphics quality, high, high, effects, V-sync?
[55:53.19]Is it like the gamma?
[55:57.00]No.
[55:59.14]Everybody just needs to relax.
[56:00.84]Alright, very high.
[56:05.30]No, I like broke the graphics.
[56:08.90]No, don't restart, whatever.
[56:10.09]What is it gonna have to do with fucking like TF2 graphics?
[56:17.87]Alright, let's go.
[56:18.39]Let's just go.
[56:21.07]Was Ambient Occlusion?
[56:24.63]Chef Ramsay.
[56:31.41]Ambient Occlusion was on.
[56:32.39]Alright, fuck it.
[56:36.06]Let's go.
[56:39.72]We don't really need to worry about how great the graphics look in this game.
[56:42.26]All we need to do is find the secret.
[56:44.52]Plus, I can actually see better.
[56:46.40]I like it like this.
[56:50.01]Ow, what?
[56:50.95]Ow!
[56:51.11]I just, like, stubbed my toe on nothing.
[56:56.25]Don't open.
[56:58.05]These all don't open.
[57:04.87]Okay, we're going this way.
[57:05.91]This really is fucking Half-Life.
[57:12.60]Is there a jump?
[57:14.52]No.
[57:15.24]Of course there's no jump.
[57:21.45]Uh... This is like a combination of Outlast, Half-Life, and some weird art game.
[57:35.12]Move.
[57:35.66]Scan it.
[57:36.84]What?
[57:37.76]What the fuck is that?
[57:39.18]It's quite simple.
[57:40.42]Reprogrammed in a simulated projection of your real life scanner.
[57:43.44]Is this fake?
[57:44.42]It will help you make sense of any inconsistencies in your synaptic recall.
[57:48.54]Your memory.
[57:50.28]I have to deal with fake walls and stuff now?
[57:53.20]Come on.
[57:56.97]What is this rat maze bullshit?
[57:59.01]Just let me play.
[57:59.75]An opportunity to engage your mind at last.
[58:07.31]No.
[58:07.45]What the fuck?
[58:09.95]It's this one.
[58:10.79]Alright, so I obviously have to do these in the right order.
[58:13.85]This one, then this one.
[58:14.83]And then...
[58:37.38]I don't know.
[58:38.14]What does it want me to do?
[58:38.78]I don't have a fucking clue.
[58:43.78]Shoot your way out.
[58:44.72]I would if I could.
[58:45.62]Um... Alright, well, actually, I just had it.
[58:56.63]I just crawl through.
[58:57.43]Okay.
[59:01.60]See?
[59:02.42]You're more than capable.
[59:04.49]If you get burned in your memory, you get burned in real life.
[59:08.34]This is true.
[59:10.46]I think I need to take a picture of this.
[59:12.78]Or something in this room, wherever the hell it is.
[59:18.87]Can't do it.
[59:20.05]Keep going.
[59:25.29]What's going on?
[59:27.18]Something feels... off.
[59:29.06]Yes, you appear to be experiencing a slight temporal anomaly.
[59:32.80]You're remembering events in the wrong order.
[59:34.98]Is that just a stack of money?
[59:36.28]It's... Probably not.
[59:38.80]Okay, well I... I don't know what that, like, advertisement I keep seeing is.
[59:48.11]What if I look at it with the phone?
[59:55.43]Okay.
[59:57.35]Alright, how do I make it so... What do I have to do again?
[60:03.13]What the fuck is that?
[60:04.09]That's like a person.
[60:04.91]No, I thought that was like... I thought that was patches from like fucking Dark Souls.
[60:10.65]Uh... God damn it.
[60:26.57]I want this to be done.
[60:27.55]Go back.
[60:31.58]I can't go backwards.
[60:32.68]There's no going backwards, guys.
[60:37.80]We're just stuck here forever.
[60:40.22]No, we're not.
[60:40.86]Alright, that was very dragged out.
[60:50.67]Pick up the corner gun!
[60:52.92]Remember how to use the weapon.
[60:54.04]Remember how to use the portal gun?
[60:55.10]Why don't you approach the firing line?
[61:00.42]Shoot 90 degrees.
[61:06.75]That's so fucking stupid.
[61:08.03]I love it.
[61:12.83]Is it just just Q?
[61:14.51]Is there anything else I can do?
[61:16.23]All coming back to you, I see.
[61:17.67]Kind of.
[61:18.55]It will soon enough.
[61:26.40]Most people were made out of jelly.
[61:30.50]The corner gun.
[61:31.46]I can't wait to corner gun somebody right in the face.
[61:34.86]Hide.
[61:36.92]Okay, hide.
[61:40.42]Look up directly at the ceiling.
[61:42.52]Bending the corner gun in this position with E will allow you to aim above cover.
[61:49.43]Okay, kind of cool.
[61:50.41]Kind of an interesting concept.
[61:51.67]You got me.
[61:55.39]You got a cool concept, but you're hiding it behind this weird psychological horror video game.
[62:02.67]Okay, let's... Alright, aim this way.
[62:09.06]Shoot what?
[62:11.64]Oh.
[62:12.78]One of these guys.
[62:16.66]Did I fail it?
[62:17.20]I think I just shot the doors closed.
[62:19.48]No, I got it.
[62:23.17]While lights on the side of your phone are to get nearby anomalies, press Alt to scan with the corner gun.
[62:29.02]Wait, what?
[62:32.86]What the hell are you trying to tell me?
[62:34.26]Um... No evidence found.
[62:48.46]I'm back in the ADS building.
[62:51.15]F1, F2, F3.
[62:51.55]Oh, God.
[62:53.67]Not this shit.
[62:59.13]No.
[62:59.75]Alright, here we go.
[63:00.43]Make sure you get him with the corner gun.
[63:16.24]Killing people will affect how others perceive you.
[63:18.52]What the hell?
[63:18.92]What are you talking about?
[63:25.34]Alright, hold on.
[63:26.62]Wait, where'd he go?
[63:29.95]Possible contact.
[63:30.69]Fire at will.
[63:47.40]Okay, I'm sorry.
[63:50.00]I'm sorry.
[63:52.49]What else?
[63:54.07]What was your... Look, I'm trying to have a little bit of fun, alright?
[64:00.49]Come on.
[64:03.46]What the fuck?
[64:04.86]Ugh.
[64:11.56]I can feel the game... Wait, I can scan this guy?
[64:13.70]No, I'm trying to scan him!
[64:18.41]I was trying to scan him.
[64:26.80]There's like a fake car here?
[64:35.27]I'm confused, hold on.
[64:41.78]No evidence found.
[64:42.59]There's a fucking car right here.
[64:44.21]Did I just get like $50?
[64:45.25]That was like the $50 sound.
[64:46.21]My fucking bitrate is tanking again.
[64:47.57]This game is killing my internet.
[65:12.53]I have to, like, turn the graphics all to, like, zero.
[65:19.02]I'm at, like, 30% CPU and my graphics card is not even being used.
[65:33.33]Wait, I saw a guy.
[65:34.97]Yep.
[65:40.87]Got him.
[65:45.02]Every time I kill someone, I just hear like the... This whole corner gun gimmick, like, seriously, like, look at how bad this looks!
[65:59.85]I can't even see!
[66:00.69]Alright, can I, like, put this down?
[66:12.24]Alright, let me get out of here.
[66:14.03]I need to, like, reload a new zone so my, like, game can stop breaking.
[66:17.29]I don't understand how this works.
[66:23.35]Everyone seems... off, somehow.
[66:26.46]But it feels so real.
[66:27.80]So do dreams, Mr. Black, until you wake up.
[66:30.80]That's the best way I can explain it.
[66:33.65]Pandora is still not fully capable of simulating human behavior I would advise against creating too much fifty dollar sound yeah it's like the windows I keep I leave logging off of windows xp every time somebody dies alright we have like I just got to this checkpoint like I I have to do this because this is getting kind of outrageous I gotta turn like everything down to like medium
[67:03.17]This game is not going to look pretty at all, but at least it'll work.
[67:08.02]No post-process.
[67:09.90]The game is... This is not my fault.
[67:12.38]This is the game's fault.
[67:14.56]Apply.
[67:16.64]Confirm.
[67:17.14]And here it comes.
[67:28.29]Let's see how shitty...
[67:30.67]Turn it down to low.
[67:31.87]Very low.
[67:32.59]I can't do very low.
[67:35.77]Yeah, I have a 6-core PC and a 1080.
[67:41.65]This game is just like... Can't fucking run.
[67:48.30]Or it can't be streamed.
[67:54.22]Let's see how awful it looks.
[68:00.99]You guys ready for Nintendo 64?
[68:02.01]We're actually pretty... Oh man, this is bad.
[68:16.20]Why is that so much easier?
[68:20.12]That's so much easier than shooting people.
[68:22.78]Pull the fire alarm.
[68:27.75]You can't even see!
[68:30.25]Oh, God.
[68:34.15]Who is even shooting?
[68:35.07]Now I gotta turn the gamma up, because I can't see a damn thing.
[68:51.60]It's too dark.
[68:54.31]Now I have to turn up the fucking gamma.
[68:56.85]This is gonna be awful.
[69:02.66]Hey, look at that.
[69:03.24]I can, like, see.
[69:04.06]I can actually see.
[69:06.58]Let's use the time gun.
[69:12.08]I hit the guy right in the throat.
[69:15.99]Yeah, pick up this random gun.
[69:17.31]Alright, let's put it on the map so I can echo locate people and then use the fucking side gun to shoot them like it wants me to.
[69:26.49]Alright, come on.
[69:38.41]Here comes the fake bench.
[69:39.95]No, it's a real bench.
[69:46.05]This is just making it harder to aim.
[70:00.44]Is that a guy?
[70:01.09]Am I shooting a guy?
[70:04.87]That's a guy right there, right?
[70:09.94]What is this guy doing?
[70:12.72]It's a suit in glass.
[70:15.09]I'm out of bullets.
[70:20.31]I have no more ammo with this gun.
[70:27.35]Give me the other gun.
[70:30.73]What the fuck, dude?
[70:34.32]Get me out of here.
[70:38.20]What is the objective?
[70:45.54]How do I take out my fucking pistol that I picked up?
[70:48.52]Oh, for the love of God.
[70:54.48]Give me his pistol.
[70:55.36]I need a gun.
[70:56.08]There we go.
[71:01.25]I'm gonna have such a bad public perception of me.
[71:03.19]And whatever the hell.
[71:04.89]Steal the prototype.
[71:05.57]Destroy all data.
[71:12.36]Okay.
[71:12.78]I'm back out to where I started.
[71:17.32]Where's the data?
[71:21.26]Data?
[71:23.94]Data?
[71:25.36]Excuse me, data.
[71:31.60]You're dead.
[71:32.57]Good for you.
[71:35.63]So, let's go destroy the data.
[71:42.19]I need this, because I need to find the data.
[71:45.73]And then steal it.
[71:48.63]Then uninstall the game.
[71:57.10]Not very specific.
[72:01.94]That's where I came from.
[72:05.66]I see little blips.
[72:06.86]Blipping.
[72:07.80]But I can't seem to do anything with them.
[72:13.16]No, that's a gun.
[72:15.12]Okay.
[72:17.32]What does it want me to do here?
[72:25.53]Okay, so what happened?
[72:30.32]Is this what it wants me to do?
[72:32.44]That's not the data.
[72:39.24]That's just like the stupid hide behind cover thing.
[72:46.49]Next, next, next, next.
[72:49.69]Not yet.
[72:50.69]Not yet.
[72:51.83]There's too much potential here.
[72:53.36]Not yet.
[72:55.70]Is this data?
[72:58.45]Nope.
[72:59.29]That's a toilet.
[73:00.29]That's a toilet.
[73:01.03]I mean, it could be considered data.
[73:02.59]That's like what food you ate data.
[73:06.41]Oh, wait.
[73:06.79]Something's in there.
[73:13.58]Nope.
[73:14.00]No.
[73:14.26]No.
[73:15.38]Not next yet.
[73:17.16]Not yet.
[73:17.68]You gotta give it some time.
[73:19.54]We have to give this another 40 minutes.
[73:20.54]It's important.
[73:21.42]It's important.
[73:31.21]Which one do I want to go in?
[73:32.03]I guess this one.
[73:39.24]Let it marinate.
[73:40.18]You didn't give Wally 40 reds.
[73:41.34]Wally didn't have a corner gun.
[73:43.08]It's going to be family feud.
[74:04.46]Seven minutes.
[74:17.37]Alright, I gotta be quiet.
[74:24.31]That was a sick choke out.
[74:28.07]That guy just turned into a wet floor sign.
[74:30.06]Is that what happens when you kill them?
[74:32.90]They turn into inanimate objects?
[74:43.70]What?
[74:49.54]Who's talking right now?
[74:57.30]I don't know who was talking, but... Family Feud's a better game mode than this.
[75:02.47]We just have- wait, that was important information.
[75:04.35]That was important data.
[75:07.09]The amateur destroyed the pipes.
[75:09.53]Reverse prop hunt.
[75:12.98]Look, I just gotta give it, like, once we get out of this dumb building, and we'll see where we end up.
[75:19.35]Come on, you guys are gonna think this is funny.
[75:20.51]I'm gonna be able to push this guy over the fucking edge.
[75:24.37]Data?
[75:25.57]I think I can scan this.
[75:30.38]No.
[75:43.12]Wait, what?
[75:46.90]I went up to fucking... I did Q. No.
[75:53.92]No.
[75:55.22]I pressed Q to like fucking melee when he pushed my face and I died.
[75:59.18]Fuck it, we're just getting to the end.
[76:02.54]Okay?
[76:05.54]No, we're just getting to the end.
[76:08.07]You know what I mean?
[76:09.80]It's only- you can only do so much before it's time just to- just to get the fuck to the end.
[76:14.11]Okay, that guy's- Use the corner guns.
[76:21.01]Right in the face.
[76:26.07]Alright, there we go.
[76:28.81]He turned into fucking confetti.
[76:30.13]That means you win.
[76:33.93]Now where are you?
[76:34.83]Where's the other guy?
[76:38.78]He's doing... He's breathing to the music.
[76:40.94]Alright, cool.
[76:42.80]Good.
[76:43.10]Let's go.
[76:49.83]Just get to the thing I need to get to, and then the tutorial will be over.
[76:53.05]And then we can play.
[76:56.29]We can play the game.
[76:59.61]Do I need to destroy these?
[77:00.49]Where's, like, the mainframe?
[77:09.38]Batman running soundtrack.
[77:10.90]Wait, what is this?
[77:17.25]Nice.
[77:17.63]Okay, I made a plant.
[77:19.05]Good for me.
[77:23.11]The whole game is a tutorial.
[77:25.47]Where the hell was this?
[77:26.32]Like, over here, right?
[77:28.74]This looks pretty mainframe-y.
[77:32.96]Right?
[77:33.18]This looks fucking pretty mainframe-y.
[77:37.95]If I was gonna be a computer to, like, get, like, data stolen from me, right?
[77:44.92]Yeah.
[77:46.46]Like, that's it.
[77:47.08]It has to be.
[77:48.56]So what do I do?
[77:55.24]That guy eats a lot of Chinese food.
[78:00.21]What do I do?
[78:02.65]Comcast service.
[78:03.63]What do I do?
[78:05.98]Alright, I'm starting to feel it.
[78:08.16]I'm starting to feel the neck syndrome, I am.
[78:16.21]I can feel the neck syndrome.
[78:23.63]Thank god that just saved it.
[78:26.81]They saved it.
[78:32.43]This reminds me of GoldenEye, but not good.
[78:35.87]Wait, what the hell?
[78:36.41]What does that even do?
[78:41.45]Also, we're getting like fucking 12 FPS again for no reason.
[78:49.01]Oh my god, just give me the fucking data.
[78:53.10]Next syndrome.
[78:54.06]I've been diagnosed with the next flu.
[79:03.02]In there?
[79:03.50]I don't know.
[79:05.22]I guess, right?
[79:06.02]Alright, we're almost there.
[79:13.79]GoldenEye actually isn't even that good.
[79:16.27]GoldenEye didn't have a corner gun, that's true.
[79:22.03]Find data to increase FPS.
[79:23.67]I fucking hope so.
[79:27.34]Do you see how badly this is running?
[79:30.06]Do you see how fucking awful this game's fucking code is?
[79:34.29]After you play this game for like 16 minutes, it goes into a memory leak.
[79:42.43]After fucking like six years in development.
[79:47.15]I can't open this fucking door.
[79:52.88]Save the girl, find it.
[79:54.06]I feel like this is fucking like a T-Mobile commercial.
[79:58.82]I'm looking for a Ryzen commercial.
[80:01.88]Save the data, man!
[80:04.06]Find that data!
[80:06.46]And it shows a guy looking under his couch and shit for fucking data, and he finds a thumbstick.
[80:11.82]I mean, I am making jokes, but this is seriously fucking getting horrible.
[80:17.41]Shoot the window!
[80:18.03]These are bulletproof glass, man!
[80:19.69]I can't open up these.
[80:20.69]Oh my god, this is running so poorly.
[80:24.26]I don't remember the code to this door.
[80:25.76]Oh, for the love of fucking God.
[80:26.96]How do I get through?
[80:27.80]The memory of the code is still there, Mr. Black.
[80:30.48]You just can't quite access it.
[80:33.30]Explore your surroundings.
[80:35.34]The mind has funny ways of helping us report.
[80:38.50]Oh, no.
[80:39.12]The mind.
[80:39.88]I don't understand.
[80:40.68]You don't need to, Mr. Black.
[80:42.60]You just need to look around.
[80:44.25]God.
[80:49.31]It's starting to die.
[80:58.28]Oh, God.
[81:03.41]What's with this music?
[81:08.63]Oh, this is hurting my computer.
[81:10.33]This is hurting my eyes.
[81:15.26]Who cares?
[81:15.96]Oh, God.
[81:17.32]It's seven.
[81:18.52]Oh, please.
[81:20.34]Alright, one of the numbers is seven.
[81:21.92]Ugh.
[81:32.94]Alright, we're out.
[81:34.16]We're out of that.
[81:36.96]We're out.
[81:40.50]Uh, by the way, GTA 5 is at 2% downloaded.
