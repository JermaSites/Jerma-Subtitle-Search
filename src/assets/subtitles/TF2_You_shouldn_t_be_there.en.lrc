[00:02.53]He's dead.
[00:04.61]This is definitely the new thing, by the way.
[00:13.78]Just snipe people.
[00:16.30]Someone's gonna drop down here and destroy us.
[00:18.77]I know.
[00:19.43]I don't have a Dead Ringer.
[00:21.71]I don't have enough health.
[00:23.65]Damn it!
[00:24.01]Ah, I headshot him too.
[00:25.27]No!
[00:34.04]Yes!
[00:35.30]Watch out, watch out!
[00:38.98]No!
[00:40.18]The pyro who knew we were there finally shows up.
[00:42.32]That's what we're doing.
[00:43.80]There's only two people on this team that are not a spy!
[00:48.68]Okay, we're going back here, because back here, this is a place where nobody should be.
[00:53.97]Ever.
[00:54.47]Yeah.
[00:55.09]And this is where we're gonna be.
[00:57.03]This is literally where nobody should be.
[00:58.93]For more than, like, ten seconds.
[01:00.21]Oh, there's a scout way up there.
[01:02.69]Got him.
[01:03.50]Did you really just get him?
[01:05.74]Oh.
[01:09.00]There's another one.
[01:09.94]There's an engineer.
[01:12.24]Can you imagine being on that point and just being like, what's happening?
[01:14.74]What am I getting hit by?
[01:15.76]Yeah, you got the health.
[01:17.72]Nice job.
[01:18.50]Who are we going for?
[01:22.73]You're going to call out the target.
[01:24.57]The target is the next guy to walk in front of us.
[01:27.87]Engineer.
[01:29.53]Oh, don't let him get that health.
[01:31.73]Oh, he got it.
[01:33.37]Whoa, whoa!
[01:34.49]There's a spy doing it too.
[01:35.85]No, he figured out the strategy.
[01:37.64]He's in a place no one should be in.
[01:40.26]Watch out for the NG.
[01:42.72]And a scout.
[01:43.44]Oh my god, this is... We've been had.
[01:45.92]We've been like, we've been found.
[01:47.84]Use your Dead Ringer.
[01:48.54]Get out with the Dead Ringer.
[01:49.78]We'll find a new place.
[01:51.48]Okay, never mind the Dead Ringer.
[01:52.88]He can't, you know, exactly hit me.
[01:59.21]He's so close to being dead.
[02:01.26]Oh, this pyro is just... Don't you just want to be, like, peppered by spies constantly?
[02:06.68]You just want to take, like, 17 damage over and over again?
[02:09.52]Oh, sniper!
[02:10.44]That guy went sniper.
[02:11.40]That guy went sniper.
[02:12.34]He's not having any of it anymore.
[02:15.82]That guy went legit sniper.
[02:19.68]You're gonna come out and you're gonna get sniped.
[02:20.98]You said the word sniper, like, ten times.
[02:23.22]I'm gonna get away.
[02:26.96]Yeah.
[02:27.32]Oh, boy.
[02:27.74]Get out of there.

[03:01.63]There he is.
[03:04.29]Sniper up top.
[03:06.52]The two-shot.
[03:09.54]I'm running out of ammo.
[03:11.54]Whoa!
[03:13.10]I think we just both hit that guy in the face at the same time.
[03:14.90]I think we did.
[03:17.66]Oh, there's a sniper on top of this thing.
[03:20.13]What do you mean this thing?
[03:21.17]I got him.
[03:21.57]Don't worry.
[03:22.55]You don't need to know.
[03:24.27]You don't need to know anything.
[03:26.13]I'm out of ammo.
[03:28.51]Watch out for the pyro.
[03:31.82]This Pyro has no idea what's hitting him.
[03:33.40]He's like, what is going on?
[03:35.32]Good.
[03:36.18]I don't want him to know.
[03:38.16]Oh, this is the part where they all come for revenge.
[03:40.58]They all know we're here.
[03:41.38]He's headshot.
[03:44.99]Oh, God!
[03:45.49]The Medic was the most powerful one of them all.
[03:48.49]No, the demo's checking here, too.
[03:51.25]We've established the meta.
[03:53.23]Washout.
[03:53.77]Okay, I'm there.
[03:58.88]Okay, we'll washout.
[03:59.62]Oh, my God!
[04:02.80]He medded me.
[04:04.40]He was just waiting there for you?
[04:05.80]Yes.
[04:07.46]This is really escalated.
[04:08.68]I mean, you can't just let two spies that you know are gonna be somewhere live.
[04:14.10]The point doesn't matter anymore.
[04:15.61]You gotta kill those spies.
[04:16.81]Because f*** spies.
[04:18.67]Why don't we just do this as snipers?
[04:21.49]Shut up.
[04:22.07]Here he comes.
[04:23.19]I heard him say spy here.
[04:24.93]Hey, he's throwing pee.
[04:25.89]Look, here he is.
[04:27.01]Ah!
[04:29.31]Cloak, cloak.
[04:30.99]Hold on, I gotta get out.
[04:33.00]I'm cloaked.
[04:34.58]Oh wow he just missed me Everybody is shooting at the pyro.
[04:38.40]I know the pyro is shooting over here and he's shooting over here Everyone's just shooting into the corner like they don't want us dead snipers giving up a little bit watch it watch it watch it Whoa I jumped over it Dude I ducked and you jumped over it.
[04:52.47]That was insane Cloaking again We have crossed the enemy
[04:59.87]Oh my god!
[05:01.71]Did he get you?
[05:03.39]I think we're a little bit more than mild.
[05:05.23]Yeah.
[05:06.19]Spicy.
[05:08.23]They're all checking it!
[05:10.84]Alright, this is where we ship the meadow.
[05:13.30]And we go to like ten feet to the right.
[05:16.56]Watch out for that pyro.
[05:18.08]Yeah.
[05:18.74]I'm getting out.
[05:20.52]He's checking it.
[05:21.86]Now I'm going up on top of this roof now.
[05:25.37]The roof makes way more sense because everyone who's going in here to check this, we can just shoot them.
[05:32.79]Yeah.
[05:33.83]Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win.
[05:40.53]Okay.
[05:43.66]There was a pyro just standing back there like waiting for spies to show up.
[05:47.92]Go, go.
[05:49.90]Ready?
[05:50.72]Yeah, they're looking at me.
[05:58.76]Sniper's coming for you.
[06:00.40]Oh, shit!
[06:00.66]I got him.
[06:06.04]I love that this is just the stupidest place in any map that we could think of, and it's suddenly like, now this is the spot that everybody cares about.
[06:16.71]Just like, just spectate me for a minute.
[06:20.27]Pyro just walked right by you.
[06:39.56]Think people are gonna like hit you then whenever you see some standing still you just go towards him really oh
[06:46.26]No, why'd you backstab?
[06:48.48]Why did that work?
[06:50.09]See?
[06:50.41]I'm telling you, this is gonna work.
[06:52.21]No, because he's gonna respawn and come kill you.
[06:55.77]Use your word.
[06:56.39]There's a statue right in front of me, too.
[06:59.17]This pyro's gonna get you.
[07:00.25]No, he's walking up top.
[07:01.45]He's not even looking at you.
[07:04.27]Dude, it's like Jurassic Park.
[07:06.16]Everyone's a T-Rex.
[07:07.04]If you don't move, they don't know.
[07:08.64]They can't see you.
[07:09.64]I don't think there's any question anymore.
[07:11.06]You're the best spy player in the game.
[07:12.80]No one has seen through this disguise.
[07:14.94]What?
[07:17.30]Look down my barrel.
[07:19.62]Look down my barrel.
[07:21.73]Dude, this would be such like a cinematic shot.
[07:23.57]You should use it as like a thumbnail.
[07:24.85]Like, down, down, right down the barrel.
[07:28.49]You should use this as like a thumbnail.
[07:30.01]Boom!
[07:30.31]Bang!
[07:30.87]Boom!
[07:31.05]Wow!
[07:31.80]Isn't that cool, man?
