[13:10.47]Something got really messed up last time, right?
[13:15.19]Oh yeah, I have the hunter honeys.
[13:18.47]Right, okay.
[13:19.61]I remember.

[13:26.90]We have these exploding guys, which they eat meat.
[13:32.68]Didn't bring any, but we'll just keep going.
[13:35.64]Okay.
[13:37.34]Fruit and meat.
[13:39.08]These are the hunter jellies.
[13:42.86]They get mad when I come over here.
[13:44.00]Alright.
[13:44.78]So they eat fruit and meat.
[13:45.90]So we need fruit or we need meat.
[13:47.71]These guys eat meat.
[13:48.43]Alright.
[13:48.71]So let me go feed all these guys.
[13:53.69]Why is he pretending to be interested?
[13:55.11]No, that's just a side effect of the face cam.
[13:58.65]Don't you understand?
[14:00.99]Side effect of the face cam is you're watching me.
[14:05.37]talk into a microphone while I Bob my head around and say things like this alright so we have to go over this way right you you you it's because it's a symptom of the face cam because I'm I'm just talking normally and me just talking normally without like expression it's just me but I'm like not interested I have to go like this okay so we got 25 vegetables in there
[14:35.19]What do we got here?
[14:36.91]Okay, strawberries coming up soon.
[14:39.89]With the face cam on, that's the only way you can tell.
[14:46.45]Okay, these, wow, look at how cute these cats are.
[14:49.52]So awesome.
[14:52.22]How much money do you guys think I'm gonna make today?
[14:55.28]How about $500?
[14:59.03]Ready?
[14:59.29]Let's do a test.
[15:00.37]You ready?
[15:01.55]What's my emotion like right now?
[15:03.87]What's my emotion like right now?
[15:08.05]Okay, so... $48.
[15:10.50]That went up a little bit.
[15:14.82]How was I?
[15:17.64]Horny.
[15:17.96]Okay, so... $48...
[15:26.61]That went up a little.
[15:28.13]You have no fucking idea.
[15:28.93]You need the face game to tell you how it was.
[15:30.20]$48?
[15:30.22]That's not enough money.
[15:40.92]That's not enough money.
[15:42.10]$48?
[15:42.12]That's not enough money.
[15:59.67]My point.
[16:01.04]The point I'm making is that's a symptom of the face cam being turned on because I'm just normally just hanging out, but I'm not enunciating enough for the face cam to be on.
[16:10.80]Self.
[16:14.06]Acting.
[16:14.40]Turn the cam back on now.
[16:25.13]How long do you guys think I can keep that on?
[16:28.35]of just talking like this.
[16:33.27]You want emotion with the face cam?
[16:35.75]I'm going to talk normally.
[16:36.78]What the fuck is happening right now?
[16:39.68]When you turn 35, your voice turns into an old person.
[16:43.38]Alright, here we go.
[16:45.64]So we'll see how long I can keep this up because people want emotion with the face cam.
[16:53.44]How many do I need?
[16:58.80]Oh, okay.
[17:02.50]Cool.
[17:02.80]10 come out when you... 10 do it.
[17:08.71]So 10 or 12 come out each time.
[17:14.95]Take these fruits back over to where I was going.
[17:16.63]15.
[17:16.65]Oh, it's 15.
[17:20.44]15. 15.
[17:29.09]We're going to go feed the guys down here.
[17:36.73]They eat fruit and meat, right?
[17:41.33]One, two, three, four, five.
[17:43.47]Are they not hungry?
[17:46.67]Why are they not eating?
[17:51.85]What are these little cute guys?
[17:52.89]Why are they not eating?
[17:55.63]Oh, they eat meat.
[17:56.51]I had that wrong.
[17:57.29]I'm such an idiot.
[18:02.05]I'm so stupid.
[18:16.82]These guys eat the fruit.
[18:18.06]Right.
[18:25.37]It was L.A.

[18:36.41]I'm going to die.
[18:39.03]Good thing the face cam was just on.
[18:40.51]Otherwise, you would never know what my emotions look like.
[18:42.59]Get out of the cage.
[18:44.11]Alright, stop.
[18:54.10]Stop exploding near me.
[18:55.36]Stop!

[24:20.97]Well, whatever.
[24:24.16]I love just running around and collecting things.
[24:26.56]It's so... It scratches so many itches in my brain.
[24:29.40]I could run around in a circle in this game and just feed and collect stuff.

[28:25.24]Honey's worth a lot.
[28:29.24]Well off.
[28:29.76]Rancher.
[28:30.24]Alright.
[28:30.68]Back up to 2,800 bucks.
[28:31.31]Feed the hunter.
[28:33.27]It's making me sad.
[28:34.31]I...
[28:54.50]I will feed the hunter.
[28:55.80]Go eat.
[29:06.63]Get it.
[29:06.87]He doesn't even want it.
[29:12.11]He's not hungry.
[29:18.26]I know, give me some plorts.
[29:21.52]Only one plort?
[29:23.41]What?
[29:23.83]Oh my god, fucking one plort handy.
[29:39.02]That's L. USB plort.
[29:47.00]Make more jellies.
[29:48.06]I know, but it's, uh, this, this really is a game.
[29:52.64]This is just my, my ADHD cannot handle this, but I'm doing fine.
[29:56.98]You know what I mean?
[29:58.84]I love this shit.
[30:00.38]This is one of those games where I can just, I can lose track every five seconds and I can still be, I'm still making progress.
[30:08.38]It doesn't matter.
[30:09.48]It's a perfect game.
[30:11.48]It's a perfect game for me.
[30:13.19]Look, right now, I wasn't even paying attention to the game.
[30:15.95]I have no idea what I'm doing right now.
[30:18.07]I guess I was picking up fruit from this tree.
[30:20.63]Making progress doesn't matter how weird it is.
[30:22.99]I'm just not doing it.
[30:24.41]I didn't even know I was doing it.
[30:27.22]Again, here we are.
[30:28.06]I'm going to go sell.
[30:37.64]This is just scratching an itch brain.
[30:41.58]This is a brain scratching game.
[30:47.58]Where are the hunter plorts over here?
[30:50.63]Let's store the... Actually, yeah.
[30:54.45]Wait, who does he eat?
[30:55.51]Somebody does.
[30:58.45]Yeah, you guys do.
[31:01.65]Okay, I'm going to tell you guys right now.
[31:03.27]It's time to make some progress.
[31:04.29]I think it's time to replace these cats.
[31:09.46]I mean, we're not... Pink Blorts?
[31:12.20]Pink Blorts?
[31:13.72]Still?
[31:15.68]Six hours into the game?
[31:17.42]I don't know about that.
[31:20.71]I think it's time to replace them.
[31:27.40]I think it's time to let them free.
[31:33.62]Yes, finally.
[31:35.36]I think it's time we put more expensive ones in here.
[31:42.07]We need a rooster.
[31:42.95]Alright, let me... Hold on.
[31:45.63]What do these guys eat?
[31:46.37]Fuck, I can't stop.
[31:47.37]Veggies and meat.
[31:48.59]No, you don't eat that.
[31:49.43]There's always a button to press.
[31:57.20]Alright, we're going to replace all these guys with bombs and stuff.
[32:00.08]Okay, cool.
[32:01.42]That's the next plan.
[32:07.32]I'm going to put a bunch of hunters in here.
[32:11.33]Store this.
[32:18.19]Just walk over there, dude.
[32:21.22]Alright, it's time to go and explore.
[32:23.06]I need to go.
[32:24.50]I need a rooster.
[32:25.68]That's important.
[32:26.60]So here we go.
[32:27.36]I'm going to that place I was before.
[32:28.64]Run this way.
[32:36.59]And that's chickens.
[32:37.67]We don't want chickens.
[32:41.61]I'm going to pick up a rooster.
[32:42.69]Here we go.
[32:48.97]Beat the game already.
[32:49.81]I don't think you beat this game.
[32:51.49]Is there credits in the game?
[32:57.92]There are.
[32:58.30]Okay.
[32:59.94]Finally.
[33:00.58]Well, I had to get myself ready.
[33:01.66]Hey, there is no finally in Slime Rancher.
[33:07.66]I have pink slimes and I have to replace them.
[33:09.72]But I like the pink slimes so I want to keep them around.
[33:11.65]They are friends.
[33:14.33]Rooster?
[33:15.73]No.
[33:16.65]I'll take you though.
[33:24.68]1080 omega LOL.
[33:25.66]What?
[33:30.13]Get a rooster.
[33:30.79]I will.
[33:32.13]Thank you for the reminder.
[33:33.11]I appreciate it.
[33:39.09]I'm going to get bomb slimes.
[33:40.53]We're doing bomb slimes.
[33:43.66]I want a bunch of them.
[33:44.28]Because I'm going to do bomb and something else.
[33:46.84]And I'm going to replace the pink slimes with bomb slimes.
[33:49.40]I'm lagging?
[33:52.84]I shouldn't be.
[33:59.33]Frames are bad?
[34:03.71]Nothing else is, like, open.
[34:06.81]FPS frames are dying.
[34:11.81]Is it doing this before?
[34:20.89]It was doing it before?
[34:22.17]Is this the game?
[34:24.66]Huh.
[34:27.15]It's the game.
[34:27.81]Oh, okay.
[34:29.47]I mean, it's running fine.
[34:31.41]Okay, I want more bomb slimes.
[34:33.55]What are you?
[34:34.01]You're a honey boom Larjo.
[34:39.36]You, give me.
[34:39.88]Come here, come here, come here.
[34:41.60]I want boom.
[34:43.10]Ah, thanks for the toss.
[34:43.96]I'll take it.
[34:44.36]Excuse me.
[34:49.12]How the hell did I just pick up?
[34:54.51]Boom.
[34:54.63]Boom.
[34:56.46]Ooh, decoration.
[34:58.94]Can I make that jump with the rocket?
[35:03.57]Probably not.
[35:05.17]Highly doubt it.
[35:08.65]I want at least like 10 to 20 bombs.
[35:09.77]Because we're going to put them... We're going to do bomb hunter.
[35:15.54]That's going to be valuable shit.
[35:19.14]Very valuable shit, I'm telling you right now.
[35:27.42]Damn it.
[35:29.32]Need more.
[35:29.66]Come here.
[35:32.58]We're just gonna go farm bombs and farm hunters.
[35:35.08]And I'm gonna be a trillionaire.
[35:37.94]I need a rooster too.
[35:46.94]Get those fucking air shots.
[35:54.20]Nice.
[35:54.80]Nice, dude.
[36:01.16]Nice, dude.
[36:07.17]No rooster, though.
[36:08.25]I'll probably have to go to the other area.
[36:16.23]Ice cream cat?
[36:16.81]Nope.
[36:19.25]We don't do cats anymore.
[36:20.15]We're not doing cats.
[36:20.75]We want hunters, honey, and bombs.
[36:23.01]And we're going to replace everybody.
[36:25.14]Everybody's getting replaced.
[36:32.25]No, I don't want a pink slime.
[36:35.87]This area is huge.
[36:36.75]No.
[36:42.32]Oh, hold on.
[36:47.86]Rooster?
[36:48.20]Let's go eat.
[36:55.22]He's replacing us.
[37:01.10]Is 12 enough for now, I think?
[37:02.42]Probably.
[37:02.82]I need hunters.
[37:07.35]Where do I get hunters?
[37:11.33]Come here.
[37:19.11]Ugly face off screen already.
[37:20.46]Rooster.
[37:26.48]Rooster.
[37:32.66]Wait, there's a key over here.
[37:37.09]I need a slime key.
[37:43.69]Bombs, bombs, bombs.
[37:46.71]Very cool.
[37:47.94]Ban that guy forever.
[37:48.98]That doesn't... I don't think I can even do that.
[37:54.20]Let me go all the way up and see what's up here.
[37:58.32]Where's the damn rooster?
[38:00.08]I don't know.
[38:01.76]I'm just trying to collect boom slimes.
[38:03.84]I'm going to do hunter boom.
[38:05.00]It's going to be awesome.
[38:10.05]What's that?
[38:16.53]Rooster.
[38:18.43]Help him.
[38:19.53]Oh, he likes it.
[38:19.99]He likes the water.
[38:20.55]Okay.
[38:26.27]Any more boom slimes?
[38:27.33]I see you up there.
[38:32.36]Okay, I want 20.
[38:34.68]20 boom slimes and I'll be happy.
[38:42.06]Come on, Gwen.
[38:42.80]Let's go.
[38:43.16]Where you at?
[38:45.78]I'm going to take a right up here and go all the way down here.
[38:47.54]Remember to get a rooster.
[38:50.79]I just got one.
[38:52.49]I have one in my inventory right now.
[38:55.61]Thanks for the reminder.
[39:02.97]Get another one.
[39:03.69]I mean, if one shows up, I'll get it.
[39:08.15]I want to go this way.
[39:09.53]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[39:12.55]Yeah, yeah, yep.
[39:13.59]Oh, yeah.
[39:15.43]Okay, that's what I want right there.
[39:17.60]Get Ross here.
[39:18.74]Let me see if I can find anything.
[39:22.02]That looks pretty good to me.
[39:23.40]Look down on all these guys and see what's here.
[39:25.30]Oh, there we go.
[39:26.02]I don't want those.
[39:30.00]I want hunters.
[39:39.30]I kind of want to take the skin off the honey slimes.
[39:40.84]I keep thinking they're pink.
[39:41.58]Is that all that's over here?
[39:44.53]Come on, really?
[39:45.09]Stop smoking.
[39:51.79]I want to go.
[39:52.17]I can't go this way.
[39:52.99]I guess I can climb this mushroom.
[39:55.87]How do I get up there?
[40:01.52]I'll take care of it.
[40:02.08]Got it.
[40:05.36]Nice.
[40:10.21]I guess I could jump on the mushrooms.
[40:13.26]I'll go up there, but hold on.
[40:14.20]I want my stupid thing to work.
[40:16.58]Okay.
[40:31.71]Ooh, what's that?
[40:38.06]Um, where am I?
[40:40.58]Okay, I'm all the way down here.
[40:41.42]Where are all the hunters at?
[40:47.10]One guy spam.
[40:50.60]One guy spam.
[40:55.74]Oop!
[40:58.29]What did I say?
[40:58.61]I wanted at least 20?
[40:59.35]There it is.
[40:59.81]Nice.
[41:00.29]Perfect.
[41:00.61]There's puddles here.
[41:04.29]Mmm.
[41:04.39]Mmm.
[41:11.33]I'm going to have a shitload of these boom slimes.
[41:17.07]Oh, what's this?
[41:17.61]Oh, well.
[41:33.97]I got a rooster here.
[41:38.35]I got what I wanted.
[41:39.03]23 Boom Slimes.
[41:40.39]Alright, it's time to replace you guys.
[41:42.39]Do Boom Slimes have to be out at night?
[41:46.23]Do I have to put these guys in the nighttime den?
[41:50.52]Or can they go out in the daytime?
[41:51.84]They can just be anywhere?
[41:54.84]So what do I do with these guys?
[42:01.37]What do I do with them?
[42:01.97]I have to incinerate them?
[42:04.47]You throw them away.
[42:05.35]You do?
[42:10.11]Throw them away?
[42:10.85]Keep them.
[42:20.16]I guess I could keep them just to have a generator of... Hold on, I have room in here.
[42:24.14]Yeah, I've got plenty of room.
[42:26.20]I've got plenty of room.
[42:28.60]No, I don't need to do that yet.
[42:30.16]But the food is scarce.
[42:33.92]What if booms eat meat?
[42:38.22]Yeah, we're going to run out of food.
[42:39.50]What do these guys do?
[42:40.28]Rock.
[42:41.92]Rock and cat.
[42:43.88]And you eat veggies and meat.
[42:46.16]These guys.
[42:46.83]Putting them up here.
[42:50.07]Rock and cat.
[42:52.27]They're going away.
[42:57.85]I'm just going to.
[43:01.64]Look, be free.
[43:02.50]I'm not going to kill them.
[43:10.52]I'm just letting him go out to, like, the wilderness.
[43:17.20]Because I have a feeling I'm going to need pink or something for some reason.
[43:19.66]I'll leave one.
[43:20.61]I'll leave pink cat.
[43:23.15]Because we have... This is rock.
[43:25.13]We have rock cat?
[43:26.45]No, get... No, no, no, no, no.
[43:27.85]Be free.
[43:28.51]Be free.
[43:28.85]Be free.
[43:29.49]Don't come back here.
[43:30.81]Stay out of here.
[43:31.47]Go this way.
[43:33.23]There's food over here.
[43:35.11]Go through... Why can they...
[43:39.49]They miss you.
[43:40.37]I know, but they don't... Kill it.
[44:02.98]No, I can't.
[44:04.43]I'll just shoot it into the fucking stratosphere.
[44:09.14]Then it'll find a home.
[44:10.06]Stop coming back here.
[44:15.17]They're gonna eat the fucking food.
[44:16.69]That was really sad.
[44:38.38]I'm sorry.
[44:38.96]Alright.
[44:39.22]I'm sorry.
[44:39.56]I'm sorry.
[44:40.92]I'm sorry.
[44:41.54]We didn't... Nope.
[44:47.70]Check this out.
[44:48.36]Now we're going to feed hunter plorts.
[44:50.72]Boom hunter.
[45:00.17]Where's the... Over here.
[45:01.11]How many do I have?
[45:01.91]Five.

[45:14.78]Hunter booms.
[45:17.13]Oh, I need a limb.
[45:26.21]Oh, shit.
[45:31.04]I need a music box.
[45:31.94]Settle down, settle down, settle down, settle down.
[45:33.72]Do I have a music box?
[45:37.52]How do I get them to stop doing this?
[45:40.26]They eat meat.
[45:41.64]Okay, meat, meat, meat, meat, meat, meat, meat, meat, meat.
[45:45.36]I need more than that.
[45:55.87]Let's feed the hell out of these things.
[46:02.55]One got out.
[46:06.34]And then they're going to feed the hell out of each other.
[46:07.84]They're going to all turn into hunters.
[46:09.98]This is going to be a moneymaker.
[46:11.14]Fill it up.
[46:18.89]You.
[46:20.17]Back in there.
[46:25.37]Jeez.
[46:27.65]Don't feed the rooster.
[46:28.69]Isn't that an old rooster?
[46:30.27]That's an old rooster.
[46:39.83]Old roosters can still do that?
[46:41.17]I didn't know that.
[46:47.02]It's too overpopulated in here.
[46:50.00]It really is so overpopulated.
[46:52.22]I think we have to take some out.
[46:57.16]How many should we take out?
[46:59.62]I think they're fine.
[47:00.36]Alright, I need to eat... They need to eat more chickens.
[47:10.91]Hit the music box.
[47:11.97]It's already on.
[47:12.45]Alright, I am out of... I am out of hens.
[47:23.06]I need to go on a hen.
[47:24.96]I gotta get a bunch of hens.
[47:27.32]It's not?
[47:27.78]Yes, it is.
[47:30.46]Oh, fuck.
[47:38.32]Eat.
[47:40.40]Eat and then multiply.
[47:41.64]How we doing?
[47:46.66]Good?
[47:54.25]I see a ploid in there.
[47:55.25]Alright, they're good.
[47:57.49]I need more hunter ploids.
[48:00.53]Sell all this shit.
[48:01.61]What are they worth?
[48:03.92]Yeah.
[48:04.58]3300.
[48:05.02]Let's go.
[48:10.95]Let's take a quest.
[48:12.98]Do water at them to calm them down.
[48:14.36]Calm down in there.
[48:20.86]Everybody relax.
[48:26.51]Quiet.
[48:28.13]Be good.
[48:29.83]Whatever.
[48:32.77]What's the quest?
[48:35.69]Uh, Thor, what do you got?
[48:37.26]Don't suppose you could also get a cup of sugar kicking around?
[48:40.42]You want a rooster for... Okay, that can be done.
[48:45.92]That's my only rooster, though.
[48:49.62]I'll get more.
[48:51.37]No, leave you here.
[48:51.91]I'll get... Okay.

[48:58.67]Oh, Jesus.
[48:59.19]Look at this.
[48:59.57]It's overcropping.
[49:02.77]Oh, shit.
[49:03.43]Oh, shit.
[49:06.59]No deal, no deal.
[49:13.37]Oh my god, overcroppage.
[49:15.07]What do I do?
[49:16.70]I have to auto-feed this stuff.
[49:22.82]Okay, we had a lot of overcroppage there.
[49:24.28]So now... I know you guys are hungry.
[49:26.92]But... Do you want everything?
[49:29.64]Hold on.
[49:34.74]Here, auto-feeder on this thing, too.

[49:41.11]Alright, whatever.
[49:41.59]Let's go.
[49:42.27]Fill it up.
[49:42.91]These guys eat everything.
[49:43.79]20.
[49:47.21]Make sure this one has, like, 20.
[49:48.37]These guys are good.
[49:51.63]Okay, you're fine now.
[49:52.54]Now we're gonna go like this.
[49:54.76]There you go.
[49:55.40]Cool.
[49:56.92]Alright.
[49:58.06]Fill this up to, like, 24 or whatever.
[50:00.36]Okay, fruits.
[50:00.80]Fruits.
[50:02.22]These guys only eat meat.
[50:03.58]Who eats the fruits in here?
[50:04.88]Get more hens by buying the hentai... ...fighter!
[50:22.04]Is this auto-feeder? ...
[50:33.83]Alright, auto feeding.
[50:35.19]These guys eat meat.
[50:36.21]Everyone else eats meat.
[50:37.27]Meat, meat, meat, meat, meat, meat, meat.
[50:38.93]I need meat.
[50:39.39]I need more birds.
[50:50.50]Clay fighter.
[50:53.06]Clay fighter.
[50:56.36]Clay fighter.
[50:58.59]But who will win the final match?
[51:00.81]Remember that song?
[51:05.53]I want to hear that right now.
[51:06.67]Clay fighter.
[51:07.29]What was it?
[51:07.69]It was the, like, director's cut.
[51:08.81]63 and a third?
[51:35.41]What was that?
[51:36.25]Clayfighter 64.
[51:37.19]Sculpting, here it is, yeah.
[51:43.62]Is this DMCA?
[51:44.42]The game's like fucking 50 years old.
[51:45.72]Is this it?
[51:52.74]A meteor crash would bake full day, turn mud-filled creatures into clay, with heroes bent on doing right, and twisted foes up for the fight!
[51:59.94]Clay Fighters!
[52:01.32]One to one they set the stage!
[52:03.29]Clay Fighters!
[52:04.55]Pounding clay is all the rage!
[52:06.13]And they have been all to the tale, but Dr. Kiln planned to kill and be released, the meteor's goo, and set more fighters on the loose!
[52:13.29]Clay Fighters!
[52:14.60]Punch and kick and they do tricks!
[52:16.62]That was cool.
[52:17.76]They don't make them like they used to.
[52:19.98]They don't make them like they used to.
[52:46.70]Remember how good video games were to me?
[52:48.29]They don't make them like that anymore!
[52:49.79]Yeah, they do.
[52:52.06]Fortnite.
[53:11.29]Somebody wrote, do something funny, but they hit enter too quickly, and it was do something F-U-N-N.
[53:17.42]They were just like, do something funny!
[53:19.74]I was too angry.
[53:21.56]Alright, I need a rooster and seven of those flying things.
[53:25.66]I'll go get them right now.
[53:27.12]I need roosters.
[53:27.72]I need chickens.
[53:28.26]A lot of them.
[53:36.55]Chickens, chickens.
[53:37.15]This is a chicken run.
[53:41.05]I'm getting a shitload of community subs.
[53:42.23]What's going on here?
[53:43.49]Lenny the person just gave 20 community subs.
[53:45.99]That's a lot.
[53:46.97]That's a ton of community subs.
[53:48.24]Thank you, Lenny.

[54:13.05]Don't swear, my kid is here.
[54:16.73]This is... What are you talking about?
[54:18.07]Put the cam back on right now.
[54:25.02]No, I was... I embarrassed myself and that's how I... Then I run away for like 40 minutes.
[54:28.68]That's how this works.
[54:30.14]Chickens only.
[54:31.12]Chickens and chickadoos only.
[54:35.49]And roosters.
[54:38.65]Get away from them.

[54:57.64]Thanks, Megadile.
[54:58.16]That's ten from you.
[54:59.68]Ten community subs.
[55:04.40]Fight her, but who will win the final match?
[55:08.51]Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[55:20.49]Watch out!
[55:21.99]I need chicken.
[55:24.10]Come here.
[55:25.16]Alright, I have a lot of chickens now.
[55:26.84]I need a couple of boosters.
[55:28.98]Let's go dump these guys.
[55:32.32]Chickadoo, chickadoo, chickadoo, chickadoo, chickadoo.
[55:35.72]What's going on with the subs?
[55:36.99]Another... Mingus.
[55:39.13]Thanks for the five community subs, Mingus.
[55:42.17]N from Queen Luigi.
[55:42.91]What's going on here?
[55:43.39]What are you guys doing?
[55:45.45]He doesn't care?
[55:46.23]No, no.
[55:48.11]Thank you for the 10 subs, Queen Luigi.
[55:50.50]That's a lot.
[55:51.88]He doesn't care.
[55:53.08]No, I don't.
[55:54.82]I do.
[55:55.62]I don't.
[55:56.06]It sounded weird when I said that.
[55:57.36]I don't.
[56:00.14]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[56:01.16]You got me.
[56:01.56]That was weird semantics there.
[56:03.27]I was like, I don't.
[56:05.03]I don't.
[56:05.87]I don't.
[56:07.07]I don't know why I didn't get Bernie.
[56:08.43]I do.
[56:09.11]I do.
[56:09.99]You guys give me a shitload of money.
[56:12.03]Okay?
[56:12.47]Of course.
[56:12.85]I would be nothing without the community subs.
[56:15.49]And the subs.
[56:16.21]And the long-term subs.
[56:17.37]And the bits.
[56:18.18]And the years of people watching YouTube videos.
[56:20.24]Of course.
[56:20.84]I am nothing without you.
[56:24.24]But thanks.
[56:25.04]Seriously.
[56:25.70]Thanks for the five subs.
[56:26.62]Thanks for the ten subs.
[56:29.07]I have so many chickens now.
[56:29.99]Let's go back.
[56:30.57]I didn't get a rooster though.
[56:38.50]Cry.
[56:41.76]Okay, let me relax.
[56:49.50]I need a rooster.
[56:50.38]I have so many chickens.
[56:51.58]They're going to fall out of the cave.
[56:59.92]Stony chick chickadoo.
[57:01.15]This one rooster.
[57:06.51]Fuck.
[57:06.79]How do I get back to town?
[57:09.81]This way.
[57:15.21]Oh my god, there's so many.
[57:20.25]Are they all going to fit in this pen?
[57:21.61]I don't think they're going to fit.
[57:25.89]Oh my god.
[57:27.01]Stop spawning them.
[57:30.05]Jesus.
[57:30.65]Okay.
[57:31.15]Um.
[57:33.35]What the hell is.
[57:35.39]They keep spawning.
[57:36.27]I have to pee.
[57:45.30]Really bad.
[57:45.82]Just drinking coffee.
[57:47.20]Alright.
[57:49.70]This is my last run around to get a bunch of that spawned.
[57:51.66]And I'm getting out of here.
[57:52.62]I'm leaving.
[57:53.14]I'm done.
[57:53.42]That's it.
[57:54.56]I'm leaving.
[57:55.69]I'm out.
[57:55.95]I'm leaving.
[57:56.25]I'm leaving.
[57:56.49]I'm leaving.
[57:56.93]Right here.
[57:57.67]I'm done.
[57:57.85]I'm done.
[58:01.48]Go pee in a gamer bottle.
[58:02.82]No.
[58:12.35]Alright, here we go.
[58:13.03]It's gonna be overflowed.
[58:20.11]Alright, let's take 20.
[58:27.42]This has got a lid on it, right?
[58:29.00]They're not going to leave, are they?
[58:29.90]Can you just eat that?
[58:31.38]Alright, who likes meat?
[58:34.66]You do.
[58:36.46]You like meat.
[58:37.90]All of you guys love meat.
[58:40.80]So we're going to auto-feed.
[58:42.43]We're going to put hens in here.
[58:45.95]There you go.
[58:50.95]Now you have an endless supply of hens to eat.
[58:55.17]Looking good.
[58:58.28]I think it's time to do a small... Oh, fuck.
[59:00.52]I forgot about this quest.
[59:02.60]One rooster and seven flying bugs.
[59:14.96]Rooster.
[59:19.08]It's nighttime, right?
[59:21.62]Rooster?
[59:21.96]Desert rest.
[59:26.35]I don't even want to pick it up.
[59:29.21]What slime do you think tastes the best?
[59:31.41]Um... Ice cream cat.
[59:34.25]But that's very rare.
[59:37.05]You don't ever get to see ice cream cat, but I would say that one.
[59:45.78]Excuse me.
[59:46.50]I'll take seven of these guys, right?
[59:51.26]Come here.
[59:54.26]Honey slime?
[59:55.80]Um... Oop.
[60:02.90]Oh my god, it's a rooster motherlode!
[60:04.68]There's another one.
[60:07.48]Where's it?
[60:15.98]There's another one up there.
[60:22.20]You don't like honey?
[60:22.91]No, I do.
[60:23.29]I mean, I just think ice... Okay, if you gave me a choice to eat ice cream or like a spoonful of honey, I would probably pick ice cream.
[60:29.99]Wouldn't you?
[60:30.81]I mean, I like honey.
[60:37.80]I would probably pick the ice cream.
[60:39.50]Okay, I need two more of these guys.
[60:40.86]Adam, let's go.
[60:49.36]I love honey.
[60:52.14]I mean, a nice vanilla ice cream with whipped cream on it versus a spoonful of honey.
[60:56.57]I don't know.
[61:02.13]I gotta go back.
[61:04.83]Wrong way.
[61:07.39]Doesn't care.
[61:08.05]Go back and save them.
[61:13.07]Go back and save.
[61:14.23]Honey on ice cream.
[61:15.19]Well, there you go.
[61:15.69]There's your based take, okay?
[61:20.25]Oh, dear.
[61:24.20]This is going to get overrun.
[61:25.14]Okay, you wanted a rooster.
[61:27.56]I got one for you.
[61:28.28]And then you wanted seven of these.
[61:32.14]Thank you.
[61:35.54]Hunter ploy.
[61:36.02]Cool.
[61:36.16]That's what I wanted.
[61:39.34]A lot of carrots.
[61:40.10]Oh, I'm going to just throw this in here.
[61:41.38]One of you guys are going to eat it.
[61:43.63]Cool.
[61:43.75]What are we collecting here?
[61:46.07]We've got 14 hens.
[61:47.87]Activate.
[61:49.45]Hunter plort.
[61:50.19]Just recycle this back in here.
[61:55.55]Oh, we're really going to be in the money.
[61:57.12]This is going to be awesome.
[62:02.52]This game has Viva Pinata energy.
[62:07.04]Yeah, I mean...
[62:10.48]I like this game more than Viva Pinata.
[62:13.98]I don't know.
[62:15.20]I like it a lot.
[62:21.25]It's too many of them, Jermo.
[62:23.85]For now.
[62:25.03]We're going to replace the cats over here with these guys.
[62:29.55]We'll give them a bigger space.
[62:37.89]How's this going?
[62:40.45]We've got food in here.
[62:41.33]14.
[62:41.95]Okay, good.
[62:44.96]Let's store the carrots in case I need them for anything.
[62:51.32]Oh, I still have those, like... Whatever.
[62:53.04]Store the carrots.
[62:58.75]Take some hens out.
[62:59.43]Because there are too many now.
[63:06.00]Alright, now we're good.
[63:06.70]I'm going to put some, uh... If you call yourself a Jermofan, laugh a little.
[63:10.77]Check me out.
[63:11.07]I'm fucking loaded on channel points.
[63:13.11]Alright.
[63:13.53]I mean, really?
[63:13.99]Okay, we'll do that.
[63:20.65]Alright.
[63:28.58]Into here.
[63:28.96]What should I buy?
[63:32.82]These guys.
[63:33.10]Are these being auto-fed?
[63:33.94]They are.
[63:34.40]Alright, nice.
[63:35.58]Ooh, that's a lot.
[63:39.03]This has an auto feeder too, doesn't it?
[63:40.41]You guys want meat.
[63:43.11]No auto feeder, but here you go.
[63:49.79]These guys love fruit and meat, so we're just going to give them meat.
[64:01.06]Suck that up.
[64:02.86]You want... Is there anyone in here still?
[64:08.96]What is this?
[64:09.38]What is this?
[64:09.72]You call yourself?
[64:10.28]Alright.
[64:10.82]What the hell are you guys up to?
[64:11.70]What do you guys think you're doing?
[64:14.28]What is this?
[64:14.59]You want me to turn on sub only?
[64:23.73]You guys.
[64:24.18]Wait.
[64:24.80]You guys.
[64:25.14]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[64:29.84]Guys, you can't substitute teacher me, okay?
[64:34.14]Oh, the teacher's not here today.
[64:35.58]We can do it.
[64:36.90]We can make like noises and like scream.
[64:38.85]We can sit at different desks and talk all day.
[64:40.87]No, you can't actually because I'm an adult and I control the room.
[64:44.63]So, there's not a sub here today.
[64:47.43]Alright, bring those hunter plorts back up.
[64:59.90]These guys look pretty good.
[65:01.07]Hunter plorts.
[65:04.10]You guys look pretty good.
[65:07.66]You smell like a sub.
[65:10.52]You mean like a fucking sandwich?
[65:13.02]Hey!
[65:16.95]What the fuck are you talking about?
[65:19.23]Is there a lid on this?
[65:20.49]How does he keep getting out?
[65:26.54]Why can't I put him back in?
[65:35.86]How the fuck do you keep getting out?
[65:38.52]Get in!
[65:40.14]What?
[65:40.40]How are they getting out?
[65:49.33]It's too many.
[65:50.53]Hey!
[65:51.51]Where's the lid?
[66:05.32]Too many bumps make the net recharge.
[66:07.20]How long does it take to recharge it?
[66:11.39]Settle down.
[66:11.87]Takes two hours?
[66:20.23]Do you have to sit here and babysit these guys for two hours?
[66:22.93]Stop blowing up.
[66:25.80]Feed them.
[66:26.12]I don't have any food.
[66:35.34]Like two hours in a game, you mean?
[66:36.96]So in like a few minutes.
[66:40.02]Is it on there?
[66:41.30]I think it's on there.
[66:41.88]Yeah, it's on there.
[66:43.64]Alright, we're good.
[66:47.34]How you doing?
[66:48.78]At this point, I should just throw you over there.
[66:56.55]What do you mean it's in real life?
[66:59.77]No, they're in.
[67:00.59]Alright, I'm just going to get away from them.
[67:04.11]Okay, I've collected.
[67:05.51]Alright, let's go.
[67:09.95]Collect all this shit too.
[67:11.23]Nice.
[67:13.53]Music box?
[67:14.03]It's already on.
[67:14.51]You look kind of like Lilum Dafoe.
[67:26.84]I don't.
[67:27.84]What are you talking about?
[67:30.37]Who the fuck is that?
[67:32.99]Who the fuck is that?
[67:34.15]Who's this guy talking about?
[67:36.59]Is it like an actor or like an author or something?
[67:42.14]What the fuck are you talking about?
[67:43.98]Alright, I need two hunter plorts.
[67:56.20]Alright, fill up this cage with more hunter bombs.
[68:01.98]Oops.
[68:05.74]Alright, there's too many in here.
[68:09.37]There are way too many in here.
[68:10.13]You're right.
[68:10.63]I need another cave.
[68:12.07]Oh, fuck.
[68:12.47]The lid's off.
[68:13.03]The lid's off.
[68:13.47]The lid's off.
[68:13.85]The lid's off.
[68:14.23]I need another cave.
[68:14.95]I gotta get rid of it.
[68:15.69]You guys are gone.
[68:16.09]Goodbye.
[68:17.03]Goodbye.
[68:17.31]Goodbye.
[68:17.57]Goodbye.
[68:17.83]All these cats are gone.
[68:20.69]That was fun.
[68:21.15]It was fun when they lasted, but I don't need them anymore.
[68:22.68]I gotta separate this out.
[68:29.20]Yep, they were fun.
[68:29.94]They were cool.
[68:30.38]They were very cute while it lasted, but that's it.
[68:33.86]Sorry, guys.
[68:36.42]I mean, but I gotta take care of this.
[68:44.44]Get rid of the rock ones?
[68:59.20]Read the instructions.
[69:00.32]What?
[69:04.28]You walked over an empty spot.
[69:05.60]What do you mean?
[69:06.18]Where?
[69:09.51]Hope you... Holy shit!
[69:12.87]Kill the rock ones.
[69:14.11]Alright, we're gonna get rid of the rock ones.
[69:18.57]Read... Next to explosive hunter.
[69:24.92]Oh my god!

[70:12.80]What?
[70:13.06]You motherfucker.
[70:22.20]Come here.
[70:24.34]Come here before you reach the audience.
[70:30.73]Why are they so angry?
[70:35.65]Give me the one that's turned off.
[70:42.61]I need to separate them first.
[70:50.12]What do they eat?
[70:50.46]They eat meat only.
[70:50.84]Oh, fuck.
[71:10.74]Do you think Big Chungus is funny?
[71:12.08]Of course I do.
[71:12.74]Is someone running to GameStop looking for Big Chungus?
[71:16.18]What the fuck?
[71:16.78]That's so funny.
[71:19.49]There.
[71:20.45]Everybody relax.
[71:28.39]Okay.
[71:30.43]Are you guys good now?
[71:42.63]Give me these hunter plorts, hell yeah.
[71:43.95]Oh, look at all these boom plorts.
[71:45.47]Alright, can you guys relax now?
[71:52.65]I need to put a few more over here.
[71:56.75]Stop!
[72:00.95]Fucking blew up in my face!
[72:03.02]Oh my god!
[72:07.32]How do I switch these guys over?
[72:14.31]What's the safe way to do this?
[72:19.50]Just feed them.
[72:20.54]They've eaten two dozen chickens.
[72:32.37]There's food in here they won't even touch.
[72:42.89]I just never stop eating stuff.
[72:44.31]Oh my god.
[72:45.91]Did I lose all those florts?
[72:48.65]Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[73:00.56]I wish I could make just a big long one.
[73:04.32]Come here, you little asshole.
[73:05.62]Oh my god.
[73:06.36]You know what?

[73:21.81]I am so mad about that.
[73:25.11]Oh my god.
[73:25.83]How do you keep these motherfuckers?
[73:27.47]What am I supposed to do?

[73:32.59]They're insane.
[73:33.83]I have too many?
[73:38.47]Did one of them die?
[73:53.89]Get in there.
[73:55.01]Alright, I'm going to get two more from this.
[74:09.54]Okay.
[74:10.82]I think we're good.
[74:11.46]One more from this over that side.
[74:12.70]That's going to be good.
[74:13.96]It's worth a lot of money.
[74:14.90]It's worth it.
[74:21.22]Okay, I think we're good.
[74:24.79]Does that look even?
[74:25.37]It looks about even, right?
[74:37.44]Okay, good.
[74:39.46]Now eat.
[74:40.92]Don't kill me.
[74:42.90]Auto-feed the hell out of him.
[74:47.14]How many fucking fruits are on the ground?
[74:49.52]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[74:50.58]Hold on.
[75:02.57]I have no food.
[75:03.25]Shit.
[75:05.55]I will, eventually.
[75:12.99]Um... Get a rooster.
[75:20.06]Alright, now I gotta... I was supposed to make money from this, and it's annoying me.
[75:26.86]Recreate the chicken sound for half a billion off.
[75:29.40]That's not even... You're not gonna give me that.
[75:40.43]Okay, there we are.
[75:41.49]Now I've got money.
[75:43.01]I'm going to have to get a lot of money.
[75:44.17]I need more meat.
[75:48.23]Okay, we're good.
[75:49.59]Meat, meat, meat, meat, meat.
[75:51.11]I need meat.
[75:54.07]Okay.
[76:05.80]Just suck up these, um... 3,700.
[76:08.62]Alright, what do I want?
[76:09.28]Did you get out of the cage?
[76:13.63]No.
[76:13.69]Alright, we're good.
[76:16.47]I need to do... Hmm... Make slimes that don't want meat.
[76:25.82]Yeah, but those guys pay off huge.
[76:27.68]I just made, like, 1,500 bucks.
[76:28.26]Okay.
[76:43.57]Alright, let's fill up these things.
[76:45.39]Look at how many of these.
[76:46.15]Oh, shit.

[76:54.11]20?
[76:54.75]Put 20 in there.
[76:55.51]20 in here.
[76:57.07]Go to the infinite chicken zone.
[77:03.38]That's true.
[77:04.42]I could do that after I sell...
[77:10.27]Honey Hunter is better than Boom Hunter.
[77:11.73]No, you're probably right.
[77:27.57]Boom is worth a lot of money.
[77:28.83]Okay, let me get this shit out of here.
[77:30.29]Alright, 50, 50, 50, 50.
[77:33.45]Alright, sell.

[78:12.02]5k Andy.
[78:12.86]What?
[78:13.02]Alright, I need meat.
[78:16.37]A lot of meat.
[78:18.75]Too much, one would probably say.
[78:20.89]Let me fill up the feeding tube thingy.
[78:24.83]Feed up the feeding tube for these guys.
[78:26.15]These guys want fruit.
[78:27.17]I'll give it to you.
[78:27.77]Dirty.
[78:32.81]These guys want meat.
[78:34.77]These guys want fruit and meat.
[78:38.74]I don't have an auto feeder here.
[78:40.12]Let's get that fixed.
[78:44.64]Load this up with fruits.
[78:46.00]Where'd you come from?
[78:51.18]Come back and check on you.
[78:52.34]Go ahead and feed this guy.
[78:53.50]He's probably really hungry.
[78:54.48]He's been sitting here for like three days without any food.
[78:56.54]Go ahead.
[79:00.60]He fell asleep before he could bite it.
[79:01.91]There you go.
[79:03.47]There you go.
[79:05.09]Good boy.

[79:24.97]Good boy.
[79:25.35]Alright.

[79:37.88]Time for a meat adventure.
[79:38.78]Hold on.
[79:42.60]Built a water tank.
[79:45.29]Quartz.
[79:46.63]Cool.
[79:48.07]Oh.
[79:49.75]This game is cute.
[79:50.43]It's very cute.
[79:58.34]Get rid of these.
[79:59.80]If I land the shot right now, it's 1 billion off the debt.
[80:02.68]If I miss it, it's 2 billion added.
[80:14.54]I'm just... I'm not doing that.
[80:17.90]I'm just kidding.
[80:18.98]Oh, billion up!
[80:20.93]You're gonna fail.
[80:23.93]No, I'm just kidding.
[80:24.87]That was no deal.
[80:25.93]That was a fake deal.
[80:30.77]I don't want cats anymore.
[80:31.71]Let's sell this.
[80:38.26]So we have just carrots over here.
[80:39.76]Okay.
[80:41.22]This is a meat run.
[80:42.04]I need a bunch of chickens.
[80:45.60]Chickens were this way.
[80:46.38]We're just gonna go on a chicken run.
[80:49.20]That's it.
[80:51.02]We're not doing anything else besides... What the hell is this for?
[80:53.44]Okay, cool.
[80:54.24]I have another pen over here.
[80:56.70]I forgot to pee.
[80:57.32]I'll be right back.
[83:56.02]So I have a question.
[83:56.64]Have you guys ever peed so much that you sit there and wonder how it's possible that could even be in your body?
[84:04.56]Like, what does it look like inside of your body?
[84:09.62]It's so long.
[84:14.02]I just peed out what could have been measured as a 32 ounce Gatorade.
[84:21.84]That was inside of my belly.
[84:26.05]That's weird.
[84:26.59]That's too much.
[84:34.36]You belly.
[84:35.04]I don't get it, dude.
[84:36.92]Why are they Titans?
[84:40.09]We already went over that.
[84:42.03]That was bait.
[84:43.09]I've seen the whole series.
[84:52.54]Alright, let's go.

[84:55.13]This game is perfect.
[85:03.77]Explain one of the... We're not going to talk about a show that a bunch of people might not have watched.
[85:09.56]We only do that with Star Wars.
[85:11.66]And like Marvel stuff.

[125:45.33]The lab.
[125:47.99]Lab.
[125:48.33]I don't know what the lab is.
[125:52.42]He wasted it.
[125:53.60]Well, eventually I'll put somebody in there.
[125:55.34]Okay.
[126:05.41]I need... I'm going to the cave.
[126:08.48]I'm going to the cave.
[126:09.56]I'm going to the cave.
[126:11.98]Yeah.
[126:12.38]It's time for me to go.
[126:13.62]I got to go to the forest and then go find the cave.
[126:16.22]I have a... I got to put my key in there.
[126:17.68]I got a key, man.
[126:21.66]No, forest.
[126:23.20]No, get the lab.
[126:27.08]I want to open up the door that was over here.
[126:30.66]Where's the... Don't.
[126:32.22]Somebody's going to eat these.
[126:34.38]The teleporter to that dock was over that way, right?
[126:44.03]I can take the teleporter that's over here.
[126:45.29]Alright.
[126:49.19]Where's the teleporter?
[127:07.52]Then this is going to take me this way.
[127:08.86]And then there was a door I could open here.
[127:16.88]I saw one of those keyhole doors up here.
[127:20.64]This is not the cave.
[127:25.84]Wrong way.
[127:26.84]Not that way.
[127:28.04]Wrong way.
[127:28.78]Wait, why do I have to open the other door?
[127:33.78]Wrong way.
[127:34.16]I'm screaming.
[127:37.30]You need the meth lab.
[127:38.52]This is where I was thinking of going.
[127:45.53]This is the area that I wanted to go look at because I knew there was a door to open.
[127:49.91]Wrong way, Jesse.
[127:51.77]Jesse.
[128:01.21]Chad is malding.
[128:05.39]I'm not going to touch anything.
[128:06.51]I'm not going to pick anything up.
[128:08.67]I'm just going to open up the door.
[128:09.89]There's a cave somewhere.
[128:14.52]Where was that cave?
[128:15.38]It's all about exploration.
[128:18.66]Isn't it this way?
[128:20.52]I'll find it.
[128:21.82]Where is it?
[128:24.86]Yeah, look, right here.
[128:25.50]This is what I wanted to do.
[128:27.68]I got a key.
[128:28.36]This is the door that I wanted to open.
[128:40.18]Ooh.
[128:42.12]Ooh!
[128:42.38]Ooh!
[128:46.25]Cool.
[128:51.64]What's that?
[128:56.22]Whoa.
[129:01.65]What happened?
[129:10.99]There's another door here.
[129:14.23]What is this?
[129:14.61]This leads to down here?
[129:18.41]I'm assuming I have to bring plorts here.
[129:21.16]And feed the plorts to this thing?
[129:23.24]To enough of them so the door will open eventually?
[129:25.20]Well, it's currently on pink plort.
[129:36.04]Good thing I didn't get rid of all my pink plort producers.
[129:38.50]Let's do it.
[129:55.96]In the meantime, uh, what should I get in the meantime?
[130:10.18]Hmm.
[130:10.46]7,800.
[130:10.52]I can go by.
[130:11.48]Okay.
[130:11.84]I can go by that dock.
[130:14.93]It's 5,000.
[130:15.35]Probably leaves me doing an area.
[130:16.67]I'm gonna do that too.
[130:18.57]I think it's already done.
[130:23.09]Is that what that means?
[130:23.95]I think it's already done.
[130:35.97]It's an example.
[130:38.53]Oh, okay.
[130:44.32]What do I want to go from here?
[130:45.32]I'm going to turn around.
[130:56.26]I'm going to go this way.
[130:57.14]A little backseating.
[131:08.48]Well, I mean, they could, I mean, they might be back sitting, but that doesn't mean I'm going to listen to the person behind me when I'm driving a car.
[131:18.38]I'm the one in the, I have the wheel in my hand.
[131:20.58]You're a passenger.
[131:23.18]No matter how bad you want to go to Wendy's, we're going to McDonald's.
[131:25.98]I'm the one driving the car.
[131:40.07]Can I get a smoothie?
[131:45.37]A McDonald's smoothie.
[131:47.27]You know what?
[131:50.09]I don't think I've really ever had one.
[131:52.04]Maybe like once.
[131:52.66]Alright.
[131:56.16]Okay, so Doc's is 7,000.
[132:00.16]I'm going for it.
[132:00.94]I got money.
[132:02.07]I've got money, okay?
[132:03.61]I got lots of it.
[132:04.31]I got plenty of it.
[132:06.03]I'm going to open up Doc.
[132:07.93]I want to see it.
[132:12.37]It's five grand.
[132:13.63]But what about the lab?
[132:14.57]But I don't know where the lab is.
[132:16.19]Okay.
[132:20.97]I'm saying I'm going to go to McDonald's.
[132:22.58]I know where McDonald's is.
[132:24.82]And you say, no, no, no, no, no.
[132:27.20]You're going to bring us to George's Hamburgers.
[132:30.76]I'm like, I've never heard of that.
[132:31.86]I don't know where that is.
[132:33.30]Go there.
[132:34.06]Type in your GPS.
[132:35.47]I don't know.
[132:36.53]I've never been to George's.
[132:37.59]I want to go to McDonald's.
[132:38.57]I want to go to George's Hamburgers.
[132:41.39]I don't know.
[132:41.85]Where is this lab you guys are all talking about?
[132:44.00]Over here?
[132:50.58]Just go there.
[132:51.92]I don't even know where that is.
[132:52.84]I have no idea where that is.
[132:53.58]It's to the south of the house.
[132:58.16]What are you on about?
[133:17.42]The lab.
[133:17.94]This is 10,000.
[133:18.64]I don't even have enough money to go to the lab.
[133:21.04]Everyone go to the lab.
[133:22.22]Yeah, George's hamburger is way more expensive.
[133:26.30]I want to go to McDonald's.
[133:27.28]It's half price.
[133:28.14]Alright, this looks good.
[133:46.60]We'll do another collection.
[133:48.94]We'll do another collection.
[133:50.34]Good.
[133:51.92]Good.
[133:52.28]Let's feed the big guys.
[133:59.24]We need meat, meat, meat, meat and more meat.
[134:03.77]Meat, meat, meat, meat, meat.
[134:05.27]We have enough meat?
[134:07.09]Probably not.
[134:07.93]But I'm gonna take it from you anyways.
[134:23.14]Ooh, okay.
[134:26.91]An elder?
[134:31.07]Perfect.
[134:31.41]Okay, nice.
[134:34.11]This should be enough food to get us to 10,000, which then I'll open the lab and everybody can relax.
[134:40.21]And you all can stop screaming into your monitor to the point where condensation breath fills up all over it and you have to wipe it down.
[134:55.58]So this is... What are these?
[134:58.20]Boom hunters.
[134:59.19]Boom hunters.
[135:00.07]Same thing in here.
[135:00.89]Let's just get it.
[135:01.35]It's already eaten.
[135:22.46]When is Elden Ring going to come out?
[135:24.98]Hopefully soon.
[135:26.50]I don't know.
[135:30.02]When was the last time they actually talked about it?
[135:31.40]I don't remember them talking about it for a long time.
[135:43.11]When they announced it.
[135:44.03]Hmm.
[135:48.57]Well, it means they've probably been working on it.
[135:54.98]Might get cancelled.
[135:55.74]That would be sad.
[135:57.44]Alright.
[136:04.22]This is going to take us to 10 grand.
[136:05.16]Let's find out.
[136:08.96]Be close.
[136:11.88]Not quite.
[136:13.30]Wait.
[136:15.14]Might get us there with this.
[136:18.78]Hmm.
[136:19.12]Could get us there with this.
[136:21.69]Hmm.
[136:24.53]Yeah, this should do it
[136:51.97]96, 97, 98, 99, 10,000.
[136:52.45]Alright.
[136:54.21]I can go open the lab.
[137:02.53]I'm going for it.
[137:10.34]$10,000.
[137:10.76]Purchase the lab.
[137:11.88]You've unlocked the lab, a special ranch expansion that will allow you to create gadgets using slime science.
[137:20.46]What?
[137:21.94]Head over to the barn to get started?
[137:23.34]What the hell is this place?
[137:38.55]This barn has all the equipment you'll need to begin crafting gadgets using slime science.
[137:44.59]Gadgets are used for utilities to aid in exploring defensive turrets, decorations, and more.
[137:50.69]Did you guys actually make me buy the cosmetic thing?
[137:59.02]In order to fabricate gadgets, you'll need resources in your refinery.
[138:03.16]Try shooting a plort into the refinery.
[138:05.06]Remember, any resource deposited in it cannot be removed.
[138:09.57]Plort.
[138:12.23]I can put a gold plort in there.
[138:18.05]Fabricate gadget.
[138:21.07]Whoa.
[138:21.29]I don't have any plorts.
[138:24.11]Hold on, I gotta get a plort.
[138:29.88]I came here plortless.
[138:40.89]Here, I'll put a boom plort in there or something.
[138:43.49]I don't know.
[138:57.40]Alright, here we go.
[139:08.90]The builder shop allows you to purchase blueprints.
[139:11.02]A blueprint is required to build any gadget.
[139:15.84]Purchase blueprints.
[139:17.72]Novice pump.
[139:21.20]Novice...apiary.
[139:24.32]Wild bees?
[139:27.75]Teleporter?
[139:28.33]Med station?
[139:31.29]Slime ball hoop.
[139:31.67]Novice pump.
[139:31.97]Cool.
[139:32.07]You buy that and then you make it over here.
[139:33.35]A novice drill.
[139:34.89]Huh.
[139:57.86]Cool.
[140:00.82]Once you have a blueprint, the fabricator allows you to craft gadgets using resources of sovereignty.
[140:04.58]Alright.
[140:05.90]Give it a try.
[140:06.44]I need... I don't have a... What's a radplort?
[140:10.00]I don't have a radplort.
[140:11.09]I don't even know what a radplort is.
[140:17.75]What is this?
[140:24.03]In order to place gadgets, you need to enable gadget mode, which is T. Ooh.
[140:29.01]In gadget mode, you cannot back or shoot, but you can see all the build sites in the world that you can place your gadgets.
[140:39.77]Have a look around.
[140:40.44]Oh.
[140:41.46]Oh, that's cool.
[140:46.90]This is really cool.
[140:53.20]Well, that got more elaborate.
[140:54.14]Once you find a build site, approach it and place a gadget menu.
[140:58.37]Simply select the gadget you wish to place.
[141:01.07]I'm really glad this does not take an inventory slot.
[141:03.89]That's a double... That's a two or three clap from the devs.
[141:08.50]To the devs.
[141:09.94]I'm glad you didn't make it take up a slot.
[141:11.26]Like, thank you.
[141:11.72]I mean, that's a huge clap.
[141:17.62]Okay.
[141:19.48]Well, now I'm glad I don't have any money.
[141:22.32]I have no resources at all.
[141:23.44]I think I bought the slime lab.
[141:31.22]Scoff.
[141:33.50]Nose turn.
[141:34.31]Scoff.
[141:48.53]I want to go to a new area.
[141:55.20]What do you got for me?
[141:57.02]Uh, mochi.
[142:00.24]$2.50.
[142:01.88]That's, I mean, that's fucking simple.
[142:03.80]That's free money.
[142:04.52]Alright, free money.

[142:10.17]Where is he?
[142:10.93]Is there another one?
[142:23.60]Is the fat slime in the forest?
[142:28.41]Go feed that fat fuck.

[142:31.61]Jesus.
[142:33.55]Alright, feed.

[143:40.72]It's completely fucking overflowed.

[144:25.04]Hmm, you're right.
[144:26.42]Okay, hold on.
[144:26.92]Let me get the rest.
[144:27.52]Nice job, guys.
[144:40.95]You produced more than anybody else.

[145:18.36]Whatever.
[145:36.31]Booms.
[145:40.85]Ow.
[145:44.33]I need one boom.
[145:45.87]I have 25 minutes.
[145:47.45]That's forever.
[145:48.21]Let's load this thing up.
[145:55.18]50 Phosphor Plorts and 50 Tabby Plorts.
[145:59.66]Good base, I think.
[146:11.73]Put the puddle floors in here too.
[146:16.51]Not right.
[146:24.63]Well, I got to buy this stuff first.
[146:25.81]Alright.

[146:54.33]Hello.
[146:57.01]Still.
[146:57.88]I still cannot take all this.
[147:00.12]Jesus.
[147:00.70]Come on.
[147:03.92]Such production from you guys.
[147:05.28]It's unbelievable.
[147:20.66]Okay, 50, 50.
[147:21.88]Good.
[147:22.32]Uh, I need a boom plort.
[147:25.22]I need somebody to eat meat.
[147:30.39]This is the best and worst game for ADHD.
[147:34.01]Because I have so many tasks I'm going back and forth doing, but I always forget one item that I need in the room that I'm going to.
[147:42.22]So, I didn't get the boom plort because I didn't feed a chicken to the guys in there, but I had to go in there to get the phosphor plorts, but I forgot to bring the chicken over to feed the guy to get the boom plort.
[147:53.56]I'm constantly forgetting one item in every single room, and I have to keep going back and forth forever.
[148:01.54]I need... Okay.
[148:01.98]Let's just do this now while it's in the top of my head.
[148:13.79]I keep running back and forth.
[148:16.24]Alright, I just need one boom plort.
[148:24.22]And...
[148:28.14]Thank you.
[148:31.30]There it is.
[148:32.38]Thank you.
[148:32.66]Okay.
[148:36.58]Got it.
[148:36.82]That poor hunter slime is alone in the corner.
[148:47.90]I know.
[148:48.34]I know.
[148:49.96]What are the phosphorus worth?
[148:53.05]15.
[148:54.35]Cool.
[148:55.87]But we have a hell of a lot of them.
[149:09.81]Complete this.
[149:10.49]Get the food.
[149:11.09]Thank you.
[149:15.80]I'll really care about some mangoes because somebody's going to want those eventually.
[149:22.16]Here, have some carrots.
[149:22.78]And have some pogfruits.
[149:32.87]And... Selvas.
[149:41.74]I have a stack of these mangoes in here.
[149:43.42]There we go.
[149:43.90]Right here.
[149:44.26]Oops.
[149:48.24]I almost have 10 mint mangoes.
[149:59.45]Limes have favorite foods.
[150:24.50]They give double plorts Okay, so if I have a boom slime and a hunter slime mixed together I
[150:34.04]They will produce double from either a briar hen or a rooster.
[150:37.75]Is that correct?
[150:43.49]Cool.
[150:46.27]Honey slimes love mint mangoes.
[150:49.23]So there's a honey boom?
[150:51.78]Who, who, where's honey?
[150:54.52]Where's honey?
[151:12.44]I have honey over here, right?
[151:14.29]Honey boom.
[151:16.19]Boom tabby.
[151:17.67]Honey hunter.
[151:18.41]Okay, honey right here.
[151:20.25]You tell me these guys will eat this and then produce double.
[151:24.09]Know what you're saying?
[151:26.94]Plant it.
[151:30.58]Wow, that's genius.
[151:35.59]Please plant one.
[151:36.35]I will.
[151:39.92]Did I replace the strawberries?
[151:52.37]Just make a new one?
[152:01.70]New farm.
[152:03.32]That really is doing double, isn't it?
[152:09.85]It is doing double, isn't it?
[152:11.45]What happened?
[152:16.21]15 and 4.
[152:17.03]Oh, come on.
[152:17.83]That really is doing double, isn't it?
[152:19.01]Alright, I'll plant.
[152:23.58]What just fucking happened?
[152:25.36]That just scared the shit out of me.
[152:26.54]I don't even know why.
[152:32.10]You just had your favorite food.
[152:33.30]Settle down.
[152:45.81]Plant it.
[152:49.66]Um... Should I just delete this?
[152:54.92]Just delete this, right?
[153:02.73]Oh, what's this?
[153:03.17]Cool.
[153:22.59]Kind of want to plant this in here, but I just need sunshine.
[153:27.58]Careful.
[153:28.28]Okay.
[153:28.66]Plant this in the lab.
[153:35.80]Um... Um... Um... Um... Um...
[153:56.20]I'm going to plant it over here.
[154:03.97]Will the chickens come eat this?
[154:05.71]Okay, here we go.
[154:16.24]Let's upgrade it.
[154:18.00]Nutrients, sprinkler, scare slime.
[154:20.80]There we go.
[154:22.18]Now I'm going to be producing a ton of these water balloons.
[154:26.39]Are there too many people in here?
[154:37.46]I think there's too many people in here.
[154:44.38]Maybe not.
[154:48.17]Alright.
[154:50.09]Next on tap is I want to go...
[154:57.96]Alright, that's going.
[154:59.10]Got an email.
[155:03.30]Alright.
[155:04.36]I now want to go and find a pink blob.
[155:11.96]Let them breed free range.
[155:19.03]Is that for real?
[155:21.27]Okay, let them breed free range.
[155:29.02]No.
[155:30.26]One guy.
[155:30.76]Okay.
[155:31.56]God.
[155:33.78]Freed free range.
[155:35.80]Of course that's bullshit.
[155:37.22]Why would that be real?
[155:45.96]Alright.
[155:47.78]Let's go.
[155:50.04]That's going.
[155:50.67]Teleporter.
[155:53.73]I'm going to go deposit all this shit into the refinery.
[155:58.07]And then I'm going to go.
[155:59.03]Hmm.
[156:01.21]What should I do now?
[156:01.77]Where have I not gone?
[156:10.34]I'll sleep first.
[156:30.54]Hey, I need money to buy things here.
[156:32.68]Feed Gordo.
[156:35.31]Uh, I gotta find another Gordo.
[156:40.25]Where was he?
[156:40.69]There was one in the forest.
[156:44.23]How did I get to 300 pounds?
[156:45.73]Um, what the hell are you talking about?
[156:53.22]Those are the Saturns.
[156:55.10]That's an emote I haven't seen in like three years.
[157:05.92]Gordo, Gordo, Gordo.
[157:07.34]I'm going for Gordo.
[157:10.68]I'm gonna make 20, uh, keyberries.
[157:12.47]And I'll bring 30 of these beets.
[157:16.67]And I'm gonna go find a Gordo.
[157:18.09]Maybe, hopefully it'll be enough to get a key.
[157:20.70]Very cool.
[157:21.10]Alright, let's go.
[157:22.74]Gordo.
[157:24.26]So we're gonna go through the teleporter.
[157:25.46]I'm ready.
[157:26.94]Teleporter into the forest.
[157:39.79]And then this way.
[157:44.99]We're looking for a pink Gordo.
[157:55.14]Northeast at sea level for Gordo.
[157:56.80]Really?
[157:59.53]This way, that way, this way, that way.
[158:08.98]I got plenty of food.
[158:10.30]Northeast sea level for Gordo.
[158:12.20]Are you lying?
[158:13.04]Okay, pink Gordo.
[158:28.59]Big pink Gordo.
[158:34.63]Northeast sea level.
[158:36.31]I think that's a lie, but whatever.
[158:39.97]Where is he?
[158:50.40]I should buy a Lexus.
[158:53.42]No.
[158:54.45]I'm terrified of owning an expensive car.
[159:01.99]What's that?
[159:08.07]No, I'm terrified.
[159:09.09]I don't want to have an expensive car.
[159:10.53]What is this?
[159:13.96]Oh, finally, the map.
[159:16.18]I was wondering why this place was so dark.
[159:18.24]I couldn't see anything.
[159:27.25]Driving around a car.
[159:28.11]That's a really expensive car.
[159:30.54]It scares the hell out of me.
[159:32.08]How many scratches did I get on it today?
[159:34.07]Did it rain?
[159:34.51]Is it going to rust?
[159:36.15]Was there dirt on it?
[159:36.67]I got to get it washed.
[159:38.19]This car is worth so much money.
[159:39.17]I don't want to fucking have anything happen to it.
[159:41.51]I'm leaving it in the parking lot alone?
[159:44.59]That's terrible.
[159:46.38]I don't want to put that.
[159:48.32]That's a $200,000 gold bar just sitting in a parking lot.
[159:50.82]Nope.
[159:59.81]I don't want it.
[160:05.31]It would never leave my mind.
[160:08.40]I would browse around that car every night, circling it, looking for dirt or scratches that were on it like the previous afternoon.
[160:18.28]And I'd be like, was that there earlier?
[160:19.44]Was that there earlier?
[160:21.46]No, was it there earlier?
[160:23.95]Somebody must have bumped me.
[160:43.01]I'm on the island.
[160:50.82]Come on, I need something.
[160:58.71]Pink slime.
[161:01.51]Big slime.
[161:02.75]Lucky slime.
[161:13.41]Damn it.
[161:19.41]Well, I can get whatever that is.
[161:26.92]Keshire.
[161:28.10]Secret style.
[161:28.98]Oh, that's cute.
[161:30.82]That's cute.
[161:31.32]Go north.
[161:45.64]Go north.
[161:48.98]That way?
[161:51.70]Can I make that jump from here?
[161:55.52]Not that I really need to.
[161:59.44]The cat boy.
[162:00.26]It kind of is, isn't it?
[162:02.38]It is a cat boy.
[162:04.34]You're right.
[162:04.72]I wonder what he's going to do that stream.
[162:10.34]Well, I can tell you it's definitely going to be after the archaeology stream.
[162:13.38]And the wonders of archaeology.
[162:15.51]on March 6th at 1 p.m.
[162:17.29]Pacific on Germa985's Twitch channel.
[162:21.06]I guarantee it's going to be happening after the archaeology stream.
[162:23.50]Go north.
[162:32.45]Well, I'm going to go north.
[162:38.15]I've gone north.

[162:46.98]Raya Hen?
[162:48.00]Sick.
[162:56.65]Okay, I went in this teleporter.
[162:58.65]Don't go in that.
[162:59.37]Go around it.
[162:59.95]Not this way.
[163:02.67]I'm going to go up here and go around and go up north.
[163:07.06]Does this guy do archaeology on March 6th?
[163:10.86]This guy will be doing archaeology.
[163:13.74]Check it out.
[163:21.06]Hmm.
[163:21.90]Can I make that?
[163:30.39]Okay.
[163:36.68]North.
[163:38.80]Hope I get a key out of this.
[164:03.39]so it's archaeology cat boy then baseball uh that sounds pretty accurate I would say that would be completely accurate what you just said I'm afraid to go down
[164:26.17]What am I looking for here?

[171:16.48]What is currently on the screen right now that I could like... What do you want me to talk about?

[171:29.19]I mean, the episode where... Kramer and, uh... And George's dad are playing pool.
[171:34.31]And they're like smashing the back of their poles into the... There's a tiny room they're playing pool in.
[171:39.12]And they keep like hitting the wall and stuff.
[171:41.46]That was really funny.

[171:47.53]I mean, we're playing Slime Rancher, man.
[172:02.47]Alright.

[172:32.35]Meats.
[172:34.83]Meats.

[172:40.09]He's waiting for me to come back.
[172:44.27]Meat.
[172:45.83]Meats.
[172:46.37]More meat.
[172:51.70]What do I need, like 50 chickens?
[173:02.57]I gave him 10 already?
[173:03.51]How many did I give him already?
[173:13.80]Seven?
[173:14.06]I gave him four, that's it?
[173:18.24]Come on.
[173:18.50]Alright, hold on.
[173:20.77]Uh, let's do this.
[173:21.41]Get fruit.
[173:28.76]Beets, beets, tomatoes, potatoes.
[173:30.82]Get those mangoes.
[173:31.54]Yeah.
[173:43.14]Okay.
[173:44.88]Chuck them off.
[173:45.56]Nice.
[173:50.49]So let's get, I already gave him 20.
[173:52.21]So I need what?
[173:54.35]30 fruit.
[173:58.29]That should be enough.
[173:58.93]Need more hens though.
[174:01.47]Okay.
[174:05.50]So I need more hens.
[174:08.22]I need like 30, 40 hens.
[174:10.66]I'm just going to take way more than I need.
[174:19.85]More meat.
[174:20.99]Um, hold on.
[174:29.91]I don't want that.
[174:32.09]46 hens.
[174:32.45]Okay.
[174:37.73]I need a lot more than that.
[174:46.20]I could take a couple roosters, but I don't really want to.
[174:59.34]I want them in one slot.
[175:04.30]Oh well.
[175:04.60]35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42.
[175:05.98]Okay, hold on.
[175:06.46]3, 44, 45.
[175:25.84]I want to make sure I... Even if I'm taking too many, I don't want to screw this up and miss one.
[175:34.46]These are the elders?
[175:35.16]I only have a few.
[175:37.34]Alright.
[175:37.68]I'm taking... That's it.
[175:38.52]Alright.
[175:38.82]I got... I think I have enough.
[175:39.78]Tons of food now.
[175:46.20]I can go back.
[175:47.32]Let's just do this.
[175:47.92]It's on the top of the brain right now.
[175:49.14]I'm going back and doing it right now.
[175:50.22]Let's go.
[175:53.30]When shit's sitting on the top of the brain, do it.
[175:56.02]I know exactly where I need to be and I know exactly where I need to go.
[175:58.53]Let's move.
[176:00.37]Let me get a sip of this coffee.
[176:15.80]Six o'clock, drinking coffee.
[176:16.98]Yeah, probably.
[176:18.26]Nobody said that, but I'm assuming you did.
[176:21.50]I'm just making it seem like you did.
[176:24.88]Answer for like the crimes I'm committing.
[176:26.46]Okay.
[176:38.53]Honey's live first.
[176:39.37]He's over here.
[176:40.27]Bang a left.
[176:41.01]Let's go.
[176:42.61]I'm ready for my free stuff.
[176:44.95]Which is not free because it costs 30 mangoes.
[176:48.03]Which are worth probably like $500 to $700.
[176:50.54]So this is a $500 to $700 thing I'm doing here.
[176:59.28]Come on, let's go.
[177:02.95]Might as well take him if I can get him.
[177:04.17]Here you go.
[177:05.15]Rooster.
[177:05.49]Uh-huh.
[177:11.95]Uh-huh.
[177:13.01]Here we go.
[177:14.15]Give me my... Give me stuff.
[177:20.97]There he goes.
[177:21.27]Oh, shit.
[177:23.74]Ooh.
[177:24.64]Wait, that's it?
[177:26.83]I don't really want the honey slimes.
[177:28.06]That's it.
[177:28.36]Oh, there's a key.
[177:30.54]Nice.
[177:30.82]A key.
[177:34.26]Excuse me.
[177:34.66]Watch out.
[177:38.88]Cool.
[177:40.36]Alright.
[177:40.68]I still have a bunch of mangoes.
[177:42.74]I got another key.
[177:43.48]Hell yeah.
[177:46.46]Let's go to the other one.
[177:47.78]He's all the way up here.
[177:50.12]Eat him all these hens.
[177:59.25]Your favorite food is worth double, right?
[178:01.18]Oh god, oh god.
[178:14.45]Is that a special honey slime or is that what they look like now?
[178:17.59]Oh, I have the DLC.
[178:19.59]You can unlock different skins for the different slimes.
[178:22.67]And I believe that's a royal jelly slime now.
[178:25.63]Just like how I got this DLC where this is a cat.
[178:28.88]Now it's a tiger.
[178:29.50]DLC.
[178:33.40]Don't do it.

[185:51.87]Why is that bot?
[185:53.01]You know, I didn't put that bot on here.
[185:55.29]It's been here since I think I've been streaming and I don't even know why.
[185:58.03]I don't even know how I don't understand.
[185:59.39]There's a weather bot.
[186:03.22]Like, can't you just type into Google weather?
[186:10.45]I don't even remember putting that on the channel.
[186:12.35]Alright, we're doing a dump.
[186:23.39]We are dumping all these plorts directly.
[186:27.44]A sneeze is coming.
[186:40.62]Okay.
[186:43.02]There's no stopping that one.
[186:47.62]I tried.
[186:52.28]Sneezed into the shadow realm.
[186:53.68]You sneeze so bad that you just implode.
[186:57.88]Look at all these fruits.
[187:02.16]I'm not going to say it.
[187:02.86]I want to so bad.
[187:04.42]I want to say it so bad.
[187:07.91]You're all saying it's not fair.
[187:09.49]I can't say it.
[187:11.69]It's not fair that you can say it and I can't.
[187:18.18]It's not fair.
[187:18.86]I wouldn't be able to say it.
[187:22.60]Nice.
[187:23.10]Yeah, I wouldn't be able to say it.
[187:24.50]Why not?
[187:24.88]That's not fair.

[187:43.16]I guess I'll have some mangoes sometime this month.
[187:52.52]Alright, deposit.
[188:05.36]I've been holding this gold fort for the whole game.
[188:13.48]Alright.
[188:14.30]I am ready to start making cash now.
[188:16.42]Here we go.
[188:16.80]Deposit these because I'm going to need them.
[188:21.20]And we're going to feed a bunch of meat, a bunch of fruits, a bunch of vegetables, and we're going to go.

[188:50.47]What a dumb commercial.
[188:52.27]Alright.
[188:52.59]I need money.
[188:58.47]So I need rad plorts.
[189:00.17]Don't have any.
[189:07.87]That's a scam.
[189:08.75]I don't know nothing about it.
[189:09.67]I just remember the guy in the Viking helmet on the subway.
[189:13.31]I don't know anything about the company.
[189:14.67]I don't even know what they... I don't even know what they do.
[189:16.23]I remember the guy in the Viking helmet standing up on the subway and going...
[189:35.44]No, and then the guy comes on and he goes, It's your money.
[189:38.45]Use it when you need it.
[189:41.51]Right?
[189:43.49]That commercial played, I think, every 12 seconds.
[189:46.86]That was on every commercial break.
[189:53.64]You could not go 20 minutes without seeing that commercial.
[190:01.02]Think of how much ad space that is.
[190:03.44]Think of how much money that probably is to have that ad play across every fucking network on Earth.
[190:09.82]Every 15 to 20 minutes.
[190:14.14]Holy godness.
[190:15.56]That's a lot of money.
[190:16.26]Alright, let's start feeding people and start making money.
[190:23.91]It must have paid off for them.
[190:25.15]I mean, I...
[190:35.58]Alright, start that process.
[190:38.23]Let's go feed everybody in here.
[190:40.47]We need meat.
[190:51.86]And we want fast feeding.
[190:54.32]Fast feeding.
[190:57.26]Now I want to get my, yep, meat.

[191:59.20]Who likes briar hens?
[192:00.89]Somebody does.
[192:05.09]Boom hunter.
[192:09.88]Boom loves briar hens.
[192:12.22]Hunters loves roosteros.
[192:14.62]Okay.
[192:17.09]Boom loves briar hens.
[192:20.71]You guys love briar hens.
[192:22.53]So might as well feed you a bunch of briar hens.
[192:24.55]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[192:39.59]Ooh, that's quite the haul.
[192:47.92]You're not going to eat it?
[192:48.58]If you're not going to eat it, I'm going to take it.
[192:50.02]You're not going to eat it, I'm going to...
[193:10.40]They don't have hands, Jeremy.
[193:14.67]Whatever.

[193:24.29]You guys love this shit, don't you?
[193:27.48]Make sure I get this right.
[193:30.22]Honey slimes love mint mangoes.

[194:09.29]What are tabbies like?
[194:12.28]Boom likes... What does Tabby's like?
[194:14.51]Stony hens.
[194:15.37]Look at that.
[194:16.81]Exactly what I have in my inventory.
[194:30.52]Nice.
[194:30.82]It's the first time I'm going to have a full stack of hunters.
[194:36.06]That's a lot of money.
[194:39.18]Some mangoes in the auto feeder.
[194:40.44]Yeah, good idea.
[194:45.30]I don't have an auto feeder for these guys, do I?
[194:50.26]I do.
[194:55.90]It is their favorite.
[194:56.82]Get back in there.
[194:57.48]Shit.
[195:18.89]Wrong one?
[195:19.31]What are you talking about?
[195:24.65]These guys eat meat.
[195:25.37]I don't have any meat left, but I will go up here and I will gladly put cube berries in here.
[195:28.97]Oh, geez.
[195:34.38]Okay.
[195:37.12]Do I?
[195:37.48]I have to sell.
[195:38.54]I got to sell almost all this.
[195:43.51]I need money.
[195:46.09]I don't have any.
[195:47.89]Don't hold it.
[195:48.47]I need like five grand to do gadgets.
[195:50.59]How you doing over here?
[195:55.12]You're kind of lonely.
[195:56.86]Unlock the cave.
[196:01.32]Oh, wait.
[196:01.86]Where's that?
[196:02.26]Is that over here?
[196:11.93]No.
[196:15.93]Pink plorts are way more important for slime science than for selling.
[196:19.93]Yeah, I figured I was going to just start dumping just massive, massive amounts of... I'm going to start dumping massive amounts of pink into the machine.
[196:31.60]And then once that's done, you know, get rid of all the pink slimes because I'm not going to need them anymore.
[196:50.60]Alright, it's time for a big sell here.
[196:54.53]Money is worth... Eh, they're kind of losing value.
[196:56.51]Well, hopefully I can make some cash from this.
[196:58.51]It's gonna be a lot.
[196:59.63]Good.
[196:59.75]Yeah, alright, I'll have a lot of money.
[197:00.89]I need to do research.
[197:19.60]Feels good every time.
[197:20.36]Alright.
[197:22.16]I'm going to go over here.
[197:26.03]Now I should have a lot of red, right?
[197:31.47]Let's get... Whatever I pick up right now, I'm literally throwing in the machine.
[197:41.42]Water plorts go for like 40S.
[197:42.62]Have you considered getting more puddles?
[197:47.53]Maybe.
[197:49.29]Probably.
[197:50.37]Yeah, I think so.
[197:52.29]But maybe not right this second.
[197:53.35]What are you guys doing over here?
[197:55.59]You have anything else I can pick up?
[197:58.85]Okay, yeah.
[198:01.74]Easy.
[198:02.00]Relax.
[198:05.98]A lot of booms.
[198:06.60]Alright, I'm going to deposit these booms.
[198:07.84]We're doing a boom deposit.
[198:11.28]That's 20.
[198:11.80]That's probably good.
[198:14.11]Some more.
[198:14.43]Alright.
[198:16.66]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[198:18.23]I'm going.
[198:20.15]Deposit.
[198:20.59]And then research a bunch of stuff.
[198:27.11]What was it really more useful on the beach?
[198:28.99]Hmm.
[198:37.40]Alright, what can I do now?
[198:38.46]Let's deposit all this stuff.
[198:39.82]Alright.
[198:48.89]Okay.
[198:50.39]Blueprints.
[198:51.87]Novice Pump.
[198:52.59]It allows you to siphon underground resources for one cycle.
[198:55.65]I don't even know what that means.
[198:56.73]I'm gonna just get it?
[199:00.10]I guess?
[199:04.90]What does that mean?
[199:07.74]Novice Pump.
[199:09.80]So this is, allows you to siphon underground resources.
[199:12.34]Fabricate.
[199:17.74]um fabricate fabricate fabricate fabricate uh this gadget is installed permanently until demolished type in resources why did I make so many because I had a lot of I don't know I want to see what I want to see what it does
[199:47.76]What does it do?
[199:52.08]Lasts for 12 minutes.
[199:53.17]What the hell does this thing do?
[199:55.35]It looks like R2-D2 machine.
[199:56.71]What is it?
[199:56.99]Uh, slime science.
[200:07.46]Extractors.
[200:11.86]Once placed on a build site, an extractor will begin working, collecting resources from the environment over time.
[200:16.08]Once it's full of resources, an extractor can be emptied.
[200:18.58]The best extractors can repeat this cycle multiple times before they finally break down.
[200:22.82]Each extractor can find exclusive resources if used in the correct zone.
[200:27.02]Pumps can find a special resource in the dry reef.
[200:30.58]Grills find a special resource in the indigo quarry.
[200:34.04]Apiaries can find a special resource in a moss blanket.
[200:36.46]And all extractors can find special resources in the glass desert.
[200:39.51]This is a pump in the dry reef.
[200:44.01]I need to go to the dry reef.
[200:44.81]The hell is the dry reef?
[200:52.05]So do I just let this run?
[200:52.93]Oh, whatever.
[200:55.83]What else can I get?
[200:56.33]A set of two teleporters that can be used to create your own quick travel link.
[201:01.74]Yep.
[201:02.46]I would love to see what that does.
[201:07.78]Ink teleporter.
[201:09.78]Ink plort, deep brine, strange diamond in a hexicom.
[201:13.26]Well, I don't have that.
[201:17.69]Roan.
[201:18.17]Helper bot that can be programmed to buzz around your ranch or perform a variety of tasks.
[201:22.53]That's 2,000 bucks, but is it worth it?
[201:27.31]Roan.
[201:29.35]Helper bot.
[201:30.97]I need honey, quantum, hunter, wild honey, jelly stone, or hexicom.
[201:35.22]Hey, that's a lot of resources.
[201:36.30]Okay.
[201:40.22]Well, what's that going to do?
[201:43.80]Maybe we should get an apiary?
[201:44.88]I just want to learn it.
[201:50.04]This is a pump.
[201:50.88]Apiary.
[201:52.22]Honey plort.
[201:52.82]I need rad plorts.
[201:58.44]Drones are so worth it.
[201:59.42]Okay.
[202:00.62]Good to know.
[202:05.82]I have the two keys now.
[202:06.86]Alright.
[202:07.24]First of all, let's take another pee break.
[202:09.32]I'll be right back.
[202:12.09]See you guys in a minute.
[202:13.22]We'll continue.
[205:40.84]You'll kill.
[205:44.60]Monster energy drink, right?
[205:46.04]That monster photo.
[205:48.36]That's funny.
[205:52.57]Okay, let's keep going.
[205:54.85]I want to get to a new area.
[205:57.95]Five stages of grief.
[205:59.11]Denial.
[205:59.91]Fuck, I'm not gonna wear that catboy costume for real, right?
[206:02.57]Entirely skip stage two, stage three, and stage four.
[206:06.88]What a weirdo.
[206:07.50]Acceptance.
[206:08.10]Let's fucking go.
[206:14.50]Do I eat rats now with a heal in my hand?
[206:21.17]Let's fucking go!
[206:22.33]Alright, let's go, for real.
[206:30.79]I am ready to begin exploring a new area.
[206:35.18]So... I gotta go... Over here?
[206:38.92]Or over here?
[206:41.12]I'm gonna assume it's over here.
[206:52.85]Okay.
[206:54.99]So, yeah.
[206:55.87]Let's go.
[207:01.17]Enable rat jam.
[207:02.11]I'm begging you.
[207:04.07]Nope.
[207:05.31]No rat jam.
[207:10.45]Nope.
[207:13.41]Nope.
[207:14.37]Not doing rat jam.
[207:16.15]Sorry.
[207:17.11]Not doing rat jam.
[207:18.96]Okay.
[207:21.88]Oh, I hope there's a Gordo in here.
[207:30.54]I have two keys.
[207:33.21]Stockpiling them.
[207:36.37]Excuse me.
[207:39.93]Did your parents really name you Germa985?

[213:43.49]Teleporter.
[213:51.39]Oh, shit.

[213:53.00]No!
[213:55.60]Don't die.
[213:56.14]I want a bunch of you.
[214:00.22]Are you biting me?
[214:00.86]Oh, shit.
[214:07.23]This guy's going to be really expensive.
[214:08.75]I want to turn everybody into poisonous limes.
[214:12.63]I want as many of these as I can fucking carry.
[214:22.96]New slime just dropped.
[214:24.14]Yep.
[214:24.32]What do they eat?
[214:30.83]Edgies?
[214:38.91]That's the only new slime that's here so far.
[214:42.51]We're going to get an absolute shitload of them.
[214:47.78]I think more than 40 is perfect.
[214:49.44]We can just breed them.
[215:00.88]I'll get a full stack.
[215:06.26]Teleporter over here.
[215:07.08]Alright.
[215:07.98]43 seems like a good amount.
[215:10.12]Read their info.
[215:13.57]Rad slime.
[215:15.07]Favorite food is Oka Oka.
[215:16.53]Cool.
[215:30.39]But their favorite food is Oka Oka, so we're going to grow Oka Oka.
[215:33.75]Their favorite food is Oka Oka, so we're going to grow it.
[215:46.18]I think we're going to replace the beets, because what's the point right now?
[215:50.52]Do I really want to grow beets still?
[215:53.68]When I have Oka Oka and it's a rad slime's favorite.
[215:57.53]I don't think there's a reason for it anymore.
[216:02.88]Let's go back.
[216:10.09]Alright.
[216:12.41]It's time.
[216:13.09]I believe it is time.
[216:16.53]We are going to get rid of one of these.
[216:22.83]Rocks or cats?
[216:26.21]Who gets to go away?
[216:29.34]I'm also going to get rid of the beet farm.
[216:30.86]I'm going to replace it with a Oka Oka farm.
[216:34.78]Oh, these are here at the end of the beets.
[216:39.61]You have other cats.
[216:42.21]That's right, I do.
[216:45.69]I do have other cats.
[216:56.24]Well, the cats know other rocks.
[216:57.96]That's right.
[217:00.04]And that's where we can get our pink from as well.
[217:02.78]So, cats, it was great.
[217:04.38]You were my first real money maker.
[217:09.34]But it's time for you to go.
[217:11.12]You're all going to be free.
[217:13.26]I will give you one last delicious meal.
[217:16.89]And then you're all going... I'm not going to give you any more food.
[217:20.43]And you're all going to go on your own.
[217:34.51]Rock's favorite food is beets.
[217:40.37]But... Oh, but I don't... It doesn't matter.
[217:42.47]Alright, hold on.
[217:46.99]Let me... One thing at a time.
[217:51.50]Let's go make a new plot.
[218:02.79]Don't fall out.
[218:09.94]I got more of my puddle slimes here.
[218:11.80]Hanging out in the pool.
[218:13.98]Puddle plort.
[218:15.04]Cool, cool, cool.
[218:17.62]Alright.
[218:19.63]I mean, I... I want more rad... No, no, no, no.
[218:25.03]Okay, we're putting rad slimes in here.
[218:30.20]we're gonna put that hunter over there like I mean make a rad hunter should I do rad but no no what's the most expensive thing right now what would give me the best return here rad what pure rad probably probably just pure rad yeah I don't want I don't want hunter red pure rad is more money yeah we're gonna put this guy over here
[218:59.89]He'll be happier with us.
[219:00.75]He'll be happier over here with actual friends.
[219:05.23]Alright, I'm only going to... I'm going to put... How many should I put in one?
[219:21.92]Is that too many?
[219:30.34]This thing's fucking exploding.
[219:33.36]All of them in here?
[219:36.64]They're going to stack on top of each other, don't you think?
[219:39.20]I mean, if this is just a moneymaker, though, then it doesn't matter.
[219:41.25]They won't get out.
[219:47.09]If I just put Oka-Okas in here and just get massive cash, they won't get out.
[219:59.68]Oh fuck, I have no money.
[220:02.08]Alright, I'm going to go plant the Oka Oka.
[220:03.56]We're getting rid of beets.
[220:11.83]Holy shit, alright.
[220:13.01]Well, he's the money maker right here.
[220:14.15]Let's just make some money.
[220:14.99]Make some cash.
[220:16.07]Looking good.
[220:31.19]And then what do I want to combine?
[220:32.67]Alright, I'm going to store these odd onions.
[220:38.87]Okay, odd onions go in here.
[220:40.27]I can store the beets.
[220:45.13]What else do I got in here?
[220:46.07]Alright, oka oka, we're going to grow instead of the beets.
[220:53.50]Combine them?
[220:54.08]What do you mean combine them?
[220:59.95]Wait, you're saying feed a green plort to the reds?
[221:10.23]Okay, remove crops.
[221:13.33]Oka, oka.
[221:14.43]Go.
[221:15.23]You can't do that.
[221:15.91]Alright, we got oka oka's growing now.
[221:18.81]You can fit more if you keep them small.
[221:23.40]That was my theory is just have a bunch of small ones and feed the hell out of them and make $50,000.
[221:31.92]No more booms.
[221:32.60]The booms kind of piss me off.
[221:34.36]They're really annoying and loud and they just hate you and just explode.
[221:36.80]Okay, so let's do this.
[221:45.94]I will have a full stack of beats.
[221:49.71]Essentially.
[221:50.27]In case I need them for anything.

[240:22.62]Or should I just deposit all of them?
[240:25.80]I don't know.
[240:27.28]I think I'm going to deposit.
[240:34.09]And then I'll sell the rest.
[240:34.87]What?
[240:36.79]This is not the way that I thought I was going.
[240:38.27]Okay.
[240:55.15]Am I going to go to my Oka Oka fields?
[240:59.02]These are probably done.
[240:59.62]Are they?
[241:00.40]Very close.
[241:06.62]Alright, I am not going to do another honey or hunter deposit.

[241:29.15]Alright.
[241:29.47]Drill.
[241:29.91]Alright.

[241:53.32]I need a pink.
[242:08.13]What's wrong with chat?
[242:11.07]Um, man, you could probably say that every day.
[242:17.61]It depends on what, like, I don't know what weird, like, chat drug they've injected today.
[242:21.21]I don't know.
[242:23.54]Oka Oka 1.
[242:24.00]Although you can probably say that about me, too.
[242:30.80]Alright.
[242:32.94]How many times have you guys come in here and I was, like, eating a Burger King burger while doing something weird?
[242:38.27]It's like, what did he do for drugs today?
[242:39.59]Like, I could say the same thing about me.
[242:42.61]I'm going to wait for the Oka Oka harvest.
[242:44.25]I need pink.
[242:58.91]Now, if I can get crystal, it would be fantastic.

[243:12.05]Yeah.
[243:13.09]It's going to be time for them to go pretty soon here, I think.
[243:15.15]Because I don't need two cages with these things.
[243:21.49]I could put like a crystal.
[243:22.67]The crystal rads are going over here, I think.

[253:45.65]I streamed Subnautica, didn't I?
[253:47.01]Alright, I think I can go back.
[253:59.80]I streamed it for like three hours and I gave up, didn't I?
[254:09.12]Yeah.
[254:09.64]No?
[254:10.06]Did I do it more than once?
[254:18.42]Alright, let's head back.
[254:19.58]I'm going to teleport out of here and I'm going to do the slime.
[254:22.02]I'm going to make... It's time to get rid of one of the pinks.
[254:24.89]I have to make a decision.
[254:25.69]I've made it.
[254:26.07]I'm getting rid of the bugs.
[254:29.57]No.
[254:29.89]What am I getting rid of?
[254:30.41]The cats.
[254:37.71]I'm back here.
[254:38.21]10 minutes will be up.
[254:42.79]Cats are gone.
[254:43.49]Sorry.
[254:51.85]Cats are gone.
[254:52.55]I'm going to take some of these guys.
[254:53.91]You know what?
[254:56.79]Boom.
[254:57.57]Hmm.
[255:00.21]Maybe it's these guys.
[255:04.96]Because this is just boom cat.
[255:07.44]I already have pink cat.
[255:10.40]I feel like the boom cats are not really worth having.
[255:19.34]Throw them into the ocean.
[255:21.30]How do I get rid of them from here?
[255:28.87]These meat only suck.
[255:31.07]That's true.
[255:32.39]Incinerate them.
[255:33.17]I don't have an incinerator.
[256:02.28]Okay, that works.
[256:02.74]Alright, what?
[256:13.03]You're bullying.
[256:14.37]What are you?
[256:15.05]Okay.
[256:16.45]So you want me to... Let's get this correct here.
[256:21.25]I'm seeing in the chat.
[256:23.14]Incinerate them.
[256:25.42]What I'm doing is I'm giving him a chance.
[256:28.16]I'm giving them a chance.
[256:31.86]you incinerate implies pick up burn to death what I'm doing is shooting him free into the ocean so he's got a chance no and I'm fine I won't even shoot him into the ocean here's what I'll do check this out okay ready
[257:02.50]Go back.
[257:03.38]Go back.
[257:03.82]Go back.
[257:04.20]Go back.
[257:04.58]Go back.
[257:06.78]Don't even think about it.
[257:07.58]He was going to explode.
[257:08.32]He was waiting for me.
[257:09.28]He was doing the thing that you did in Team Fortress where you just sat at a teleporter as a spy and found the direction where it was facing, stood behind it, and backstabbed like 12 people as they came out.
[257:22.24]Look.
[257:22.66]There we go.
[257:23.36]He can be free.
[257:24.59]You know what?
[257:25.39]You can just live out here.
[257:26.43]No, he can't.
[257:30.33]Look.
[257:30.83]They can live on their own island over there.
[257:39.48]I would do that to a point where in the chat, in the TF2 chat, I'm going to be screaming at all capitals.
[257:46.34]Kill the fucking spy at the teleporter.
[257:48.94]Oh my God.
[257:50.10]You guys are fucking stupid.
[257:56.24]I'd be sitting there going naked.
[258:04.72]See?
[258:05.56]He's blasting forward and rocket shipping over there.
[258:21.90]I'm not murdering him.
[258:23.40]I'm letting them fly to a new island.
[258:25.76]They can populate it and go free.
[258:29.67]Incinerate them.
[258:31.19]Look.
[258:31.57]Ready?
[258:32.29]Look at this.
[258:33.17]Look at the islands over here.
[258:34.01]See?
[258:35.79]Look at that.
[258:36.21]He's going all the way over the mountain.
[258:37.61]Poof!
[258:38.19]Into the distance.
[258:38.73]He just did a rocket.
[258:39.54]He turned on thrusters and went forward over the cliff.
[258:42.58]He'll be fine.
[258:49.09]He's going to land somewhere and just be like, oh, I'm fine.
[258:51.25]I'm good.
[258:51.55]Plus, look at how strong they are.
[258:53.58]They have powerful explosion abilities and he's a cat.
[259:01.20]Nothing's going to hurt him.
[259:01.86]And then, poof!
[259:07.96]Blaster.
[259:18.59]Okay, now we get to do some cool shit.
[259:23.23]It was really fun.
[259:23.90]You guys helped me a lot.
[259:26.70]You did a great job.
[259:34.48]I think he did explode.
[259:36.48]I think I got it wrong.
[259:37.56]I think he actually is exploding in the air.
[259:39.04]There's too much oxygen in the atmosphere and it just sucks up into him and he blows up.
[259:43.60]I think that's what's happening.
[259:45.28]Alright, crystal slimes, go on in.
[259:51.85]Correct?
[259:59.38]That's what I'm doing.
[260:01.36]Or... Do we just have crystal slimes make money?
[260:05.81]Oh, shit.
[260:09.23]Yes.
[260:09.47]Stop sounding like a child.
[260:12.13]What?
[260:15.53]Just leave the crystals.
[260:16.92]Should I?
[260:20.22]I shouldn't combine them?
[260:22.46]Crystal rads.
[260:23.40]That's what I was thinking.
[260:24.14]Gold.
[260:27.54]I thought you can't feed gold to anybody.
[260:35.71]Your crystal is better.
[260:37.03]Is it?
[260:38.73]You can't feed gold to anybody.
[260:40.73]What do they eat?
[260:41.21]Veggies?
[260:41.89]Oh, this is perfect.
[260:42.49]Feed it to water.
[260:46.27]Okay, well, hold on.
[260:48.67]Let me just check this out.
[260:54.83]Your crystal is based.
[260:57.09]I feel like this is boring, though.
[261:02.09]What's Crystal's favorite food?
[261:07.94]Odd onion.
[261:14.04]No, I'm combining them because then their favorite food will be Oka Oka.
[261:19.08]That's what's happening here.
[261:20.28]That's what I'm doing.
[261:21.36]That's what's happening.
[261:28.60]Oka-oka time.
[261:29.20]Let's go.
[261:47.17]Any more?
[261:47.77]Any more, more, more, more, more?
[261:52.15]You look kind of boring looking.
[261:57.12]I would do... Crystal... I don't know, but I... You can't make any money.
[262:02.04]You gotta use the expensive stuff.
[262:03.20]How much are they worth?
[262:10.90]75 a pop.
[262:11.78]Okay, thankfully that market came back.
[262:13.40]Alright, that's worth 75 a pop.
[262:19.73]Let's get the other Oka Oka farm.
[262:22.65]Onion ring.
[262:24.61]Onion ring.
[262:37.82]30.
[262:37.84]Let's go on back this way and start feeding.
[262:46.20]It's the wrong way.
[262:46.90]Oh, nope.
[262:51.82]Onion ring.
[262:54.28]Okay.
[262:56.20]Your favorite food is Oka Oka.
[262:59.95]Eat it.
[263:01.95]And here we go.
[263:02.51]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[263:14.48]I want you to eat that.

[263:39.20]It's easy.
[263:39.42]Why is it getting so huge?
[263:40.22]14 crystals.
[263:46.22]Nice.
[264:04.72]They look like freaking Mortys.
[264:07.62]Oh, they do look like Mortys.
[264:21.41]How dare you.
[264:22.99]How dare you.
[264:23.93]Alright, suck that up.
[264:35.70]I read it.
[264:36.30]I didn't say it.
[264:40.04]Who in here needs to change still?
[264:43.04]Anybody in there that hasn't changed?
[264:44.16]Still people that haven't changed?
[264:48.80]I think everyone's turned.
[264:52.20]Yeah, looks good.
[264:52.92]Alright, let's do it.
[264:55.00]Crystal plorts.
[264:57.18]Crystal plorts.

[273:03.01]It is a huge loop.
[273:05.67]It's just a loop, I know.
[273:07.41]But it's a very satisfying loop.
[273:12.69]It's a loop that I am having a great time doing.
[273:16.61]Okay.
[273:19.21]Teleporter.

[273:39.36]Whoa.

[274:16.42]That's going to stay here, right?
[274:17.34]If I leave?
[274:17.74]It's a fossil.
[274:20.27]Okay, I'll be right back.
[274:38.34]Hurry.
[274:38.46]Hurry.
[274:40.44]I'm getting hungry.
[274:42.10]I'm hungry.
[274:42.46]I'm going to clean this up and then I'm going to stream again.
[274:46.78]And then we'll pick right back up tomorrow.
[275:02.69]And after tomorrow, we'll see how far I am and how much I'm still doing.
[275:07.47]Because maybe one more stream of this would be us get satisfied of playing.

[275:34.69]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

[279:01.87]I would highly recommend it if you've ever had it. ...
[279:15.05]Just cheese.
[279:15.67]You know, I'm not going to say that just cheese is not good.
[279:20.69]Sometimes just cheese is all you want.
[279:23.83]A good slice of cheese pizza is perfect.
[279:26.71]A lot of times.
[279:30.11]Okay, let's go make a few of those.
[279:37.25]Four cheese.
[279:40.53]Yeah.
[279:41.91]Kind of like a white pizza.
[279:43.45]White pizza is fantastic.
[279:45.95]I gotta really be in the mood for white pizza, though.
[279:47.43]Alright, to the lab.
[280:08.74]Deep dish pizza.
[280:09.30]I actually don't like deep dish pizza.
[280:10.84]I'm not a big fan of it.
[280:12.16]It's pie.
[280:13.90]It's kind of like a pie.
[280:15.06]I don't really like it.
[280:24.59]It's really heavy, too.
[280:26.47]Tons of cheese.
[280:27.15]It's a cheese pie.
[280:29.03]I mean, this is not what I like.
[280:33.58]Ever been to St.
[280:36.36]Louis?
[280:36.56]I've never been to St.

[280:48.95]More pink.
[280:51.90]Oh, whatever.

[280:56.16]I need pink.
[281:02.69]I'll just put these up for now.
[281:08.04]They're my flavored pizza.
[281:09.16]What do you mean?
[281:15.98]Somebody mentioned this earlier.
[281:17.11]These things just stay consistently expensive.
[281:20.93]I should really... I should... Honestly, 20-20 hindsight, that should have been a pond over there.
[281:26.05]And I should have had like two dozen of these things.
[281:32.56]Okay.
[281:33.46]Let's teleport back.
[281:45.74]advanced drill that's just gonna go for three cycles well well well remind me of that yes uh um what remind me of that yesterday remind me of this tomorrow because I'm gonna forget these are here
[282:13.66]Alright, alright.
[282:14.30]I'm gonna call it here.
[282:15.68]I am prepared to go explore another area.
[282:20.99]Very soon here.
[282:21.57]Let's deposit this before I go.
[282:25.67]Or sell?
[282:31.24]Let's sell.
[282:36.02]Doc, we'll do that tomorrow.
[282:40.93]Remind me to buy the dock tomorrow and to open up those things I got back there.
[282:52.97]I got 15 grand.
[282:53.59]This is awesome.
[282:54.09]Alright.
[282:58.11]Is there anything I can buy right now?
[282:59.95]Treasure cracker.
[283:01.76]Is it time to get this?
[283:02.48]I'm doing it.
[283:12.17]The van.
[283:12.71]Cool.
[283:19.81]Alright, awesome.
[283:21.53]I still have one key.
[283:22.35]I'm going to go to the dock tomorrow.
[283:24.79]And... Go to S5 Grand.
[283:30.90]Would you want Valve to make Team Fortress 3?
[283:32.84]Uh, no.
[283:35.46]Not unless they really wanted to.
[283:41.33]I feel like that would have to be a project that we really wanted to work on.
[283:47.37]We got Half- Alyx because they just felt like making it.
[283:50.24]That game was incredible.
[283:53.78]Whenever Valve tries to jump on something that they think they should be doing, it doesn't turn out well.
[284:03.16]When Valve does something because Valve feels like they want to do it because it's something that somebody has a cool idea, usually it turns out okay.
[284:17.35]So let them do things that they want to do at their pace whenever they feel like it.
[284:22.13]That's how you get the best shit from Valve.
[284:27.05]And I mean, obviously, everyone kind of thought, well, maybe they lost it.
[284:30.26]They don't have it anymore.
[284:32.58]I wasn't a big Dota 2 fan.
[284:33.82]I know it's popular, but whatever.
[284:35.50]Artifact was kind of weird and messy.
[284:38.44]I guess it was okay.
[284:40.14]I don't know.
[284:41.83]Can they make games anymore?
[284:43.08]Do they even want to make games anymore?
[284:44.62]And then Half-Life Alyx comes out and it's like, well, okay, never mind.
[284:48.20]I guess they can still do that.
[284:50.84]So, I guess just wait for them to do something that they feel like doing.
[285:02.61]Game of the year artifact.
[285:04.25]I would disagree with you.
[285:09.70]They're contributing in other ways to the games industry.
[285:12.08]Oh, yeah.
[285:12.64]I'm just talking merely game development.
[285:15.86]Just purely Valve making a video game in-house.
[285:19.90]I mean, if you want to talk about the business side of things, I mean, they've kind of changed the entire world with Steam and everything.
[285:30.95]But, you know, that's a whole other conversation for the Jerma985 podcast with special guests next week.
[285:38.50]Otto.
[285:38.76]I don't have anybody.
[285:40.16]It's just me and the dog.
[285:44.62]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[285:46.07]Have a great rest of your night.
[285:47.51]This game's awesome.
[285:48.15]It's fun just to play it.
[285:49.67]We're going to do it at least one more day tomorrow.
[285:52.25]See how it goes.
[285:52.95]If I'm still having fun, then yeah.
[285:55.93]Maybe I'll keep going.
[286:01.06]Have a great night.
[286:02.26]Let's go through the credits.
[286:03.88]There were a shitload of community subs today.
[286:05.32]There they are.
[286:11.23]At one point, there was like 100 in like a 10-minute span, so thank you, guys.
[286:17.82]Never expected, never obligated, but always appreciated, right?
[286:23.24]Thank you.
[286:30.41]Take care of yourself.
[286:31.01]Take care of you, too.
[286:33.79]Make sure you're doing that.
[286:39.62]Uh, raid somebody.
[286:40.33]Yeah, let's raid somebody.
[286:41.15]Make sure we raid tonight.
[286:42.53]Let's see who's live.
[286:44.81]Who's live on, like, the guy that follows, like, ten channels, Andy.
[286:51.57]Hmm.
[286:52.11]Hmm.
[287:10.18]Should we branch out?
[287:10.88]Should we branch out to somebody we've never rated before?
[287:12.28]What do you think?
[287:14.64]Who's live?
[287:17.50]I'm here to take suggestions.
[287:34.79]I've seen a lot of names.
[287:37.39]I've seen a lot of names.
[287:47.32]Hmm.
[288:00.42]You know what's funny about raids?
[288:01.38]I always have so much trouble with raids because I'm just like, who, who, who do I do?
[288:04.98]Who is it?
[288:05.36]Who?
[288:05.70]Hmm.
[288:06.62]What about this person?
[288:07.36]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[288:08.04]We did that person like a week ago, like two weeks ago.
[288:10.15]What about that person?
[288:10.75]That person's new, but do I know this person?
[288:12.03]Who is this person?
[288:13.19]I've never seen them before.
[288:14.11]What do they do for videos?
[288:14.99]I'm about to send a bunch of people there.
[288:15.99]Who are they?
[288:16.51]Who are you?
[288:17.29]What's happening?
[288:18.07]Should I, should I just raid?
[288:19.09]You know, let's just go this way.
[288:21.41]Networking Andy.
[288:26.53]But this is not Networking Andy.
[288:40.54]I gotta pick somebody.
[288:41.42]I gotta pick somebody now.
[288:42.48]I gotta figure it out.
[288:43.33]Who is it?
[288:48.41]Time's up.
[288:48.93]The credits are over.
[288:51.55]The post-credits scene is here.
[288:55.15]The post-credits scene is here.
[288:57.59]I'm in frame right now.
[288:58.99]I don't know what to do.
[289:05.42]Slime-sicle?
[289:06.80]Oh, shit.
[289:07.58]Slime-sicle's raided us like five times before, hasn't he?
[289:18.29]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[289:20.45]Let's return the raid.
[289:21.63]Slimesicle has raided this channel like four or five times.
[289:23.93]So, really appreciate that.
[289:26.41]Let's go.
[289:26.89]Go say hello.
[289:27.43]There, we got it.
[289:27.83]Done.
[289:28.07]Let me make sure I spell this right.
[289:38.76]I feel like raiding channels on this channel is me picking food at a restaurant.
[289:45.66]I just don't know what to eat.
[289:46.72]I don't know what to pick.
[289:49.81]What do I order?
[289:50.79]And then I feel like I ordered wrong.
[289:54.12]But then I get the order and I go, no, that was great.
[289:56.24]That's perfect.
[290:00.90]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[290:01.76]Go save Lotus Limesicle.
[290:03.68]Very, very, very, very nice dude.
[290:05.21]He's rated this channel at least three or four times over the last few months.
[290:10.19]Networking Andy.
[290:11.17]Call me whatever you want.
[290:12.05]That's fine.
[290:13.37]I'll see you tomorrow.
[290:15.37]Have a great rest of your night.
[290:18.72]I'll see you tomorrow.
[290:20.43]Around 2.30 Pacific.
[290:24.43]2.30 p.m.
[290:24.69]Pacific tomorrow.
[290:26.01]See you soon.
[290:27.49]Take care of yourselves.
[290:28.79]Good night.
[290:52.79]Thank you.
