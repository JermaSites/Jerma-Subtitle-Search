[ve:60.16.100]

[00:11.75]Wow.
[00:59.30]So I'm going to be going all day today, guys.
[01:04.13]It's going to be a long stream.
[01:05.25]It's going to be one of those streams that starts at like 1 and goes to like who fucking knows when.
[01:14.11]Because there's a lot to do today in World of Warcraft 7.1.
[01:21.16]If you don't know...
[01:25.16]Well, I'll be right back.
[01:26.74]I'll talk about this when more people get here.
[01:28.34]I'm going to just let my beautiful starting screen to let you know that it's starting soon.
[01:35.91]I'll be back.
[01:37.85]I've got to get a drink, and I'm going to make a tweet, and we'll talk about it when I get back.
[01:42.23]So I'll see you in a minute.
[02:09.66]Wait, what?
[03:19.56]Ooh.
[03:20.66]So yeah, we're going to be here for a while.
[03:22.96]Let's switch over to the game now.
[03:27.98]Hey, look it.
[03:28.38]I'm flying on my bronze Super Drake.
[03:32.96]I got this back in like 1997.
[03:33.70]Okay.
[03:41.40]Thank you, Lulladoria, for your seven months in a row.
[03:44.64]Much appreciated.
[03:45.62]Welcome back.
[03:47.58]Seven straight fucking months.
[03:55.49]A dragon?
[03:56.05]Yeah, look at this dragon.
[03:57.31]It's huge.
[03:59.61]It's like the easiest free thing to get in the whole game.
[04:04.40]Yeah, oh, there's a reason why I'm here.
[04:06.42]Wait, what?
[04:09.26]There is a reason why I'm here.
[04:10.59]Let me move a few things around.
[04:14.15]Okie dokie.
[04:15.71]I'm never really ready.
[04:18.09]I'm always not ready.
[04:20.51]Alright, now I'm ready.
[04:23.85]Hey, Louie.
[04:24.71]Louie the Cashew, thank you for nine months.
[04:27.27]Give me, well, I don't want to give you either one of those things.
[04:32.91]But nine months is a long time.
[04:34.25]We now have a child.
[04:35.05]We have a baby.
[04:39.39]Sup, baby, oh my god!
[04:43.27]Bronze Draco.
[04:44.07]Oh, you think I'm a casual, do you?
[04:46.59]You think I'm a casual in World of Warcraft?
[04:49.49]Would a casual have this mount?
[04:55.87]Would a casual have this mount?
[05:01.23]I got you.
[05:02.69]You thought I was going to die.
[05:05.59]Everyone was just like, oh, what an idiot, he clicked a button.
[05:08.48]No, I didn't.
[05:09.69]I'm fine.
[05:11.11]Would a casual have the heart of the aspects?
[05:16.74]Didn't think so.
[05:19.60]I'm going to Blackrock Mountain right now.
[05:23.54]Because I so desperately need to get my bubblegum outfit.
[05:30.33]I'm hoping it'll drop.
[05:33.33]Everybody's doing the 7.1 shit and I'm like going to get my bubblegum costume.
[05:42.28]It's going on Vine Thulu for seven months.
[05:43.86]Thanks a lot, dude.
[05:44.48]Welcome back.
[05:46.22]Also, thanks to Seeple and Ranko25, both new subs.
[05:51.13]Welcome to the family, guys.
[05:56.03]Dark Souls 3.
[05:56.61]There's a lot of shit this week.
[05:58.35]That's why there's going to be like a little extra long streams this week because there's a lot of shit to do.
[06:07.13]Like, first of all, Karazhan.
[06:08.21]7.1 in Karazhan came out today.
[06:10.79]Which I normally wouldn't care that much about.
[06:13.36]But because Karazhan is, like, probably my favorite dungeon ever.
[06:21.38]That's bad.
[06:21.74]Where the hell is Blackwing Lair?
[06:23.34]I always, like, forget where the hell this place is.
[06:24.75]It's in here, right?
[06:25.37]Right down here.
[06:28.81]But Karazhan is back in, like, 2007, 2008.
[06:30.43]That's, like, my favorite place on Earth.
[06:35.06]I love that place.
[06:36.96]And they've remade it for this expansion.
[06:39.84]Are you kidding me?
[06:40.54]I have to do it.
[06:41.02]I have to play it.
[06:52.69]The life is six minutes.
[06:56.11]So, I want to play this tonight.
[06:59.11]We're going to go pretty much all day into the evening time.
[07:03.24]I hope I can get a group together for Karazhan.
[07:05.23]I think, like, Etalyx and Boo and those guys expressed potential interest.
[07:12.67]But we're going to do this real quick.
[07:14.13]I just need to do... I've got to clear this whole dungeon in, like, five seconds.
[07:16.98]Don't worry.
[07:17.40]It won't take long.
[07:21.10]It won't take long, I promise.
[07:24.70]I just have to beat an old dungeon by myself to try to get the transmog.
[07:31.12]And you probably have no idea what the hell I'm doing.
[07:32.47]I'm cheeseballing this whole thing.
[07:35.57]Took me a long time to realize how to actually cheese this correctly.
[07:42.85]Clicker?
[07:43.21]Yeah, I have to click one move and it's Arcane Explosion.
[07:45.65]Everything else is non-clicker now.
[07:52.08]If you wanted to get into World of Warcraft, where should I start?
[07:55.14]In Legion.
[07:56.76]Because it's the best expansion in almost 10 years.
[08:02.46]Play TF2 for Halloween?
[08:06.20]Didn't they not even do anything for Halloween?
[08:08.92]Isn't it the same thing that they've done for the last three years?
[08:11.14]Isn't it like Merasmus again?
[08:16.13]It's like bumper cars and Merasmus again, isn't it?
[08:18.11]Dude, we should do it!
[08:26.47]How come they don't have cross-faction, cross-race multiplayer?
[08:34.41]I should be able to just put a thing in my name, and when I make my character, they're like, oh, settle my differences.
[08:38.80]I don't care.
[08:43.52]I kind of did this wrong, but it's okay.
[08:46.54]It's okay.
[08:47.04]It's the same thing as last year.
[08:50.33]Yeah, it's not really anything different.
[08:52.53]I don't even really play TF2 that much anymore.
[08:57.10]I get asked this question a lot.
[08:59.16]It's like, oh, you're gonna check out, like, the TF2 update?
[09:02.58]It's like, no, I haven't played that game in a very long time.
[09:07.65]When TF2 adds something, like, substantial and significant and... Fuck, I can't even see it.
[09:12.91]Oh, God, give me the orb.
[09:14.09]I should... Oh, God.
[09:15.11]Oh, God, what a mistake.
[09:15.89]It's okay, I got it.
[09:20.10]Oh, boy, I screwed this whole thing up.
[09:21.40]Wait, what?! !
[09:24.80]No, I screwed it up.
[09:26.88]I screwed it up.
[09:29.06]I'm supposed to be down here.
[09:29.86]It's okay.
[09:33.40]I can save it.
[09:34.04]I can save it.
[09:34.58]I can save it.
[09:35.79]Maybe I can't save it.
[09:36.89]Oh, fuck.
[09:39.13]I'm supposed to do this down here.
[09:41.97]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[09:47.25]Okay, maybe I think I salvaged it.
[09:48.43]I think I'm fine.
[09:54.90]Why did that not... What the fuck?
[09:57.24]I'm going to have to reset this.
[10:03.34]I think I have to reset it.
[10:04.52]Yeah, I do.
[10:06.86]I don't know why.
[10:09.09]Why are they still on me?
[10:12.51]That never happens.
[10:15.73]I fucked it up.
[10:22.19]I fucked it up.
[10:26.22]I don't know why... When I grabbed... You're supposed to stand down here.
[10:31.19]I was just not paying attention.
[10:36.47]What the fuck is happening?
[10:38.31]It's a very stupid specific thing you have to do because you have to mind control this boss.
[10:48.41]But I fucked it up.
[10:49.77]I was supposed to click it down here and I messed it all up.
[10:52.27]So we have to wait a second or two.
[10:55.92]This speedrun channel sucks.
[11:01.89]But, uh, thanks a lot.
[11:02.69]Thanks, ShamNoel.
[11:03.75]I wish we could play.
[11:05.65]But, you know, alliance is the better race.
[11:07.75]It's like the better of the two races, or factions, whatever you want to call them.
[11:13.78]Come on, anytime now you can respawn.
[11:15.64]Thank you.
[11:17.34]Alright, now I'm not gonna fuck it up this time.
[11:19.66]Stand down here.
[11:21.12]Thank you very much.
[11:25.47]But thank you, LayLays, for five months.
[11:27.91]Also, thank you to... I think I got everybody else here.
[11:33.20]Beer.
[11:34.28]Oh, there's another one.
[11:35.42]There's a new one.
[11:41.02]Young Baja Blast.
[11:44.63]Wait, what?
[11:46.61]Young Baja Blast.
[11:48.49]That's a great drink.
[11:49.85]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[11:50.67]And the Frazz Boy.
[11:52.55]Hi, Frazz Boy.
[11:58.93]Talking about TF2 and stuff like that, I don't play Overwatch.
[12:02.25]When was the last time you saw me play Overwatch?
[12:05.33]It's just... My tastes change with the seasons, man.
[12:11.31]You can't ever expect me to stay interested in something for more than a month or two.
[12:17.29]Unless it's something really, really, really, really good or something that I really get into.
[12:23.31]The last time I played Overwatch, I think me, Boo, and Stealth and Etalyx just jumped into the Halloween event.
[12:31.09]I don't play Overwatch.
[12:33.44]I don't play TF2.
[12:34.00]You know what I'm saying?
[12:39.86]I go where the fucking tide takes me.
[12:43.02]And right now that tide is going out.
[12:54.06]Sometimes the tide comes in.
[12:58.46]Play World of Tanks.
[13:05.05]World of Tanks is like one of the most popular famous games in the world.
[13:10.75]Is it really that good?
[13:12.27]Isn't it like one of the most played games on Earth?
[13:16.15]It's pretty impressive.
[13:20.33]But we're going to do something a little different today, I think.
[13:23.85]I don't think anybody's around.
[13:26.45]There's a huge attunement quest you have to do for Karazhan.
[13:29.77]And I'd like to get it done before actually, you know, getting into prime time, as they say.
[13:38.90]It's garbage.
[13:39.84]It's really grindy.
[13:41.48]War Thunder is better.
[13:43.00]I don't know anything about it.
[13:43.78]I just know it kind of exists and people play it.
[13:45.88]Alright, we did it right this time.
[13:54.68]Oh, MLC Stealth is around.
[13:59.20]MLC Stealth, you can go ahead and come in the Teamspeak if you'd like.
[14:03.16]You love World of Tanks?
[14:04.05]I just keep hearing that people play it.
[14:10.11]And look at this.
[14:10.59]Watch this.
[14:10.89]Ready?
[14:11.11]In three, two, one.
[14:13.71]The magic is over, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:16.65]Oh, shit.
[14:17.41]The dragon's free.

[15:24.77]Look at this 7.1 content.
[15:26.31]Destruction.
[15:38.40]I love how in my title it says, Perusing 7.1, and I'm very clearly in, like, Patch 1.2.
[15:43.94]860 Demo Lock if you need one.
[15:53.69]I want to do Mythics with viewers, so... Because you need to do, like, four to attune to Karazhan.
[15:59.75]Blame.
[16:00.99]Death.
[16:01.79]Destruction.
[16:03.58]Tower of Mortals.

[16:23.85]I need the chest This game is lame
[16:31.28]Well, it's something I like to play at the moment.
[16:36.62]Same with a lot of other games.
[16:45.38]Rip.
[16:49.71]Do you know where to go for the 7.1?
[16:50.69]Yeah, I do.
[16:52.57]I know where to go for all the 7.1 stuff.
[16:54.15]I just wanted to get this out of the way because a new week is by and I'm trying to collect a transmog outfit.
[17:00.66]And it's pretty much all of it's from here.
[17:04.90]All of it is in this dungeon.
[17:09.09]Oh, really?
[17:09.47]Did I pull everybody?
[17:13.37]Look at how powerful I am.
[17:19.06]Oh, this place sucks.
[17:21.16]You guys ready for some fun?
[17:23.60]Check this out.
[17:24.18]I hope you guys are ready for the... No, I'm changing.
[17:26.06]Do I have any more of those tomes?
[17:28.28]So I can change my talent right now?
[17:30.34]I don't think I do.
[17:33.49]Shit.
[17:34.91]Well, this is going to be a pain in the ass.
[17:37.77]This is going to be a monumental pain in the ass.
[17:43.07]We're slow.
[17:53.70]Go into full roleplay zone.
[17:56.32]Since you've banned me, I'm going to start wishing minor inconveniences upon you.
[18:02.49]Well, you did get a life sentence ban.
[18:10.35]Yeah, the slow motion room.
[18:16.43]I think there's a way around this, but I've always just blasted through it and didn't even care.
[18:23.55]I don't know why I put that on, but... Thank you, Apollo.
[18:26.23]Apollo 22237 for eight months.
[18:29.09]Witty comment here.
[18:29.91]Well, that was pretty witty.
[18:32.43]Bando again?
[18:35.68]No, he's not Bando.
[18:36.92]When am I going to turn on my facecam?
[18:44.10]Probably never.
[18:45.62]You guys already know what I look like.
[18:48.56]You just pretend like you know the different faces I'm making right now.
[18:51.92]I bet you one of them's like this.
[18:52.92]One of them probably looks like this.
[18:55.78]In the last face motion, it probably looks like this.
[19:04.97]It's like shitting noises.
[19:07.39]Yeah, I sit on the toilet when I stream.
[19:11.69]Jeremy looks like man, that guy.
[19:20.60]Hey, look, it's a boss!
[19:25.82]That's always so funny.
[19:28.10]Netherweave boots?
[19:29.18]No, I need... I think Nefarian drops it, actually.
[19:37.00]Yeah, the headpiece.
[19:37.54]I don't actually want the headpiece.
[19:38.54]I just want the chest.
[19:39.68]The chest is like a big bubblegum cotton candy thing, and I want it so bad.
[19:44.13]Watch out, another boss.
[19:46.97]Another boss.
[19:48.13]What do I do against this guy?
[19:53.02]I don't know why I'm even picking these up.
[19:54.76]Don't ask me.
[19:58.19]Who drops the chest then?
[19:58.89]Is it Chromaggus?
[19:59.43]No, he drops the shoulders.
[20:11.67]You can't ban me.
[20:12.63]I think you're unbannable.
[20:18.21]Nefarian does drop the robe.
[20:19.27]Yeah, I knew one of these guys in here does.
[20:21.49]I just clear it every week to try to get it.
[20:23.00]I have everything else, I think.
[20:28.32]Oh, a new appearance.
[20:30.20]So let me explain.
[20:31.56]Okay, so now it's been like a few minutes and people are trickling in.
[20:35.16]Let me explain what's going on today.
[20:42.09]So... 7.1 of World of Warcraft launched today, like less than an hour ago.
[20:47.01]And the point that I'm trying to do here is I'm going to just slowly kind of peruse the content.
[20:52.41]And then Karazhan, like the big dungeon that came out in 7.1, I'm going to do it later tonight.
[20:58.68]It's a new, like, hard mythic dungeon.
[21:01.08]Brand new content.
[21:03.94]But for the next few hours, just going to chill and peruse the content that's in 7.1.
[21:14.20]Tomorrow is an off day for streaming, but I'm probably going to stream anyways because Dark Souls 3 DLC came out also today.
[21:22.04]And I'm going to play the DLC tomorrow.
[21:25.26]And then Thursday is more Mafia 3.
[21:28.10]Friday is probably more Mafia 3 or Sorcery.
[21:33.37]So there's a lot of shit this week.
[21:36.41]Stop saying peruse.
[21:37.79]Why?
[21:38.23]That's like... I said it like three times.
[21:50.56]I actually do want to start sorcery this week too.
[21:53.67]But there's... It requires me to stream every single day.
[21:58.51]So expect to stream every day this week.
[22:00.23]You want to see something funny?
[22:04.59]Here's the funny part.
[22:05.27]Watch this.
[22:09.33]I'm going to sit here for like five minutes.
[22:13.20]This was a big deal back in Vanilla.
[22:15.22]These guys all run out and freak out and you have to like spring them around, kite them around, get like three tanks.
[22:20.91]No, it's gonna stand here for like a few minutes.
[22:26.77]This looks a lot like Hearthstone.
[22:30.03]All this dust is gonna like kill the bit right at the stream, I bet.
[22:38.85]Impressed.
[22:46.52]Hope you don't wear us out and leave us for another two months.
[22:48.48]I won't.
[22:50.47]Don't worry.
[22:51.65]That's never going to happen again.
[22:56.07]How many can come out here before I take one point of damage?
[22:59.35]Well, I took 24 right there.
[23:05.85]Hope I don't crash my computer by doing this.
[23:08.10]I might.
[23:14.61]I probably will.
[23:15.33]I gotta get rid of this.
[23:16.87]This is going to crash my game.
[23:20.53]They made a donut.
[23:21.55]Oh, look at all those bones.
[23:23.97]I didn't even do that before.
[23:24.93]It's a human fucking bagel.
[23:30.29]Here he comes.
[23:32.27]Remember this card in Hearthstone?
[23:33.43]Oh, there he is.
[23:37.55]There he is.
[23:38.15]There's Nefarian.
[23:40.29]He's not even a card, is he?
[23:41.81]His dad is.
[23:46.68]Oh, Nixie is a card.
[23:47.52]How come Nefarian's not a card?
[23:49.04]That's weird.
[23:52.62]I'll let you get a good look at him before I instantly kill him.
[23:56.56]Bye.
[23:59.40]Alright, come on, come on.
[24:00.40]Give me, give me, give me the fucking robes.
[24:02.90]Give me the robes!
[24:05.28]Uh... Uh... No!
[24:10.58]Shit!
[24:12.06]I didn't get it.
[24:14.60]Damn it, I have to wait another week.
[24:18.32]Another week goes by where I don't have the Netherwind chest.
[24:25.92]Shit.
[24:29.66]Oh, well.
[24:31.76]Oh, okay.
[24:32.46]Whatever.
[24:32.72]Get swindled.
[24:38.26]If he's so strong, why does he do this dungeon?
[24:39.68]Alright, let me explain this.
[24:42.44]There's a thing called transmogging in this game.
[24:45.48]where you can make your gear look like anything in the game that's ever existed.
[24:52.28]So for instance, if you really thought that something from original content was really cool looking, like see these shoulders I have on?
[25:00.50]These shoulders are from 2005 or like, no, 2004.
[25:06.18]You can't get these anywhere else but this dungeon.
[25:09.06]So what they allowed you to do is you can wear whatever you want.
[25:12.62]See these eye level 865.
[25:15.06]This is current gear in this Legion expansion.
[25:18.51]I have them set to look like the old content stuff because this is what they actually are supposed to look like is that.
[25:26.71]And like, fuck that.
[25:27.63]They're not bubblegum cotton candy spouting fountains.
[25:31.43]So I don't want it.
[25:33.77]That's why people do these old runs to try to get it so they can collect it, so they can collect the appearance.
[25:41.77]And Arcane got buffed in this patch too, so maybe I'll do some more damage.
[25:44.65]That'll be good.
[25:45.92]Let me get out of here.
[25:48.76]Alright, so who... Who has this game that also is like at least eye level 830?
[25:57.76]835?
[25:57.82]Something like that?
[26:03.63]That wants to do the Karazhan Attunement Mythic Dungeons.
[26:08.65]My item level sucks.
[26:11.72]Yeah, well... It's alright.
[26:14.16]It's fine.
[26:14.66]854.
[26:14.94]It was 856.
[26:17.42]But I had to put this ring on because it's just a dickload of mastery.
[26:20.28]And that's what I need so badly.
[26:21.44]Because after this current patch in 7.1... Mastery just became...
[26:27.96]absurdly like to a point where it's absurdly stupid I have this game shut up what's wrong with you dick my voice is kind of gone oh my god you sound like bev bighead I'm sorry what's going on dude I'm trying my best how are you doing I'm doing good I'm doing good how are you I can't even talk you yeah you sound like
[26:57.03]Can anybody even guess who this is?
[26:58.41]This is Atalix.
[27:01.55]Atalix today.
[27:03.51]Do you want to do the Karazhan attunement stuff?
[27:06.35]Yes.
[27:07.17]Okay.
[27:07.57]So we're going to pick random people in chat to come do it with us.
[27:11.49]The attunement stuff.
[27:16.83]Let me invite you.
[27:17.83]Actually, invite me.
[27:19.97]So you're doing it on your enhancement shaman?
[27:23.76]Elemental Shaman.
[27:25.12]Do you want me to invite you?
[27:26.62]Yeah, invite me.
[27:28.18]And then I'm going to give you... So you went back to Elemental.
[27:37.18]Yes.
[27:38.22]Got buffed.
[27:39.16]Just kidding, not really.
[27:39.98]Yeah, didn't only like two moves get buffed?
[27:43.95]One move got buffed.
[27:45.73]Cool.
[27:46.73]Move that's like 10% of my damage got buffed.
[27:51.67]Alright, it either sounds like you're really sick or you just got done with like a 10k run.
[27:59.14]Get grandma away from the mic.
[28:00.90]I was like coughing all night.
[28:04.06]Oh my god, why is everybody sick?
[28:06.30]Boo's sick too.
[28:07.11]I think you got what I had.
[28:09.45]Alright, well let's... So here's what we need, guys.
[28:13.57]We need a DPS.
[28:15.45]I'm a DPS also.
[28:15.93]We need one more DPS.
[28:20.45]who is alliance that can play with us.
[28:25.01]And you're going to whisper me.
[28:27.01]The first person is that, you got to be at least like eye level 830 because these are normal mythics we have to do.
[28:34.04]So if you're eye level 830 and you're a DPS, send me a whisper.
[28:38.56]I'm just going to pick the first person.
[28:42.16]You gotta be, like, eye level 830, though, because I do want to, like, get this done.
[28:46.35]So don't, like, message me if you're, like, in, like, eye level, like, 780.
[28:49.49]Like, you just got 110.
[28:50.09]And you're like, yeah, I'll come to the Mythic.
[28:54.31]Yeah.
[28:56.53]And thank you to Mitzi700.
[28:58.31]Thanks a lot, Mitzi.
[28:58.93]Welcome.
[29:00.03]I'm gonna try to talk as little as possible.
[29:02.36]I'm just, like, a viewer, and I'm not here.
[29:04.46]Alright, will you stop, like, kirkling up tinfoil?
[29:08.24]I'm making...
[29:13.04]Alright, hey, get out of here!
[29:15.26]What the hell are you doing?
[29:16.28]I'm making pizza rolls.
[29:17.86]Alright, I just muted him.
[29:20.45]I just muted him.
[29:21.23]He's just like fucking making loud noises.
[29:23.33]Alright, this is the part where we got a DPS.
[29:32.23]So this is a gnome warlock.
[29:34.98]Cool.
[29:37.92]Oh my god, you guys don't even want to know the noises he's making.
[29:39.92]It's disgusting.
[29:43.23]I muted your whole feed.
[29:47.27]He's making like... I'm so glad you viewed it.
[29:52.61]Alright.
[29:54.63]Now, if there's anybody watching right now, that's a tank.
[29:58.36]That's at least, you know, eye level 830, 835, somewhere around there.
[30:02.66]That wants to do it.
[30:03.40]Send me a message.
[30:04.00]Send me a whisper.
[30:06.80]I'm on Shadow Moon, by the way.
[30:08.30]Jocko Shadow Moon.
[30:12.22]Get Sham.
[30:13.28]He's a horde, isn't he?
[30:15.34]Yeah, he's a horde.
[30:16.08]I would.
[30:18.36]I gave you talking privileges again.
[30:20.41]Hey, welcome back to the stream, everybody.
[30:23.49]Yeah, Mark is a horde.
[30:25.51]Unless he has, if he has somebody that's on Alliance that can do a mythic, I would definitely take him and get him in here, but we are, there's a barrier in front of us.
[30:40.24]Have we got anybody?
[30:40.96]What about a healer?
[30:43.09]We can pug the last one.
[30:44.73]Yo, Jerma.
[30:45.73]I can tank 834 Paladin.
[30:47.73]834 Paladin.
[30:49.11]I'm tank.
[30:49.65]Oh, boy.
[30:50.07]Okay.
[30:50.25]Alright.
[30:52.07]This guy that says, Yo, Jerma.
[30:53.23]Alright.
[30:55.60]The guy that said, Yo, Jerma, did say it first.
[30:57.86]So, I'll bring him in.
[31:04.36]So, by the way, the group is going to change after every dungeon.
[31:08.04]So, if you're like, Ah, shit.
[31:09.79]I didn't get in.
[31:10.35]Well, we have to do four for the Karazhan attunement.
[31:14.79]Really?
[31:15.49]Yes.
[31:16.23]You have to do four mythic dungeons.
[31:20.18]The quest port?
[31:20.92]Or what is it?
[31:21.80]Yeah, go to Dalaran and talk to Khadgar.
[31:24.78]Is it called... No, it's... Are you sure, dude?
[31:33.47]You didn't have to leave.
[31:36.07]Because I'm going to change people anyways.
[31:41.64]Yeah, I'm going to change it up anyways, so people that didn't get to play can do the next one.
[31:46.44]Oh, that's nice of you, dude.
[31:47.96]You were fine.
[31:48.44]It's okay, man.
[31:49.82]We'll grab him.
[31:51.34]I just wanted to be famous.
[32:01.25]It's all good.
[32:02.53]Alright, now we need a healer.
[32:05.09]If you are a healer, please send me a whisper.
[32:09.19]Whisper.
[32:11.39]And we can just get this going.
[32:16.57]When does 7.1 go live in EU?
[32:18.21]I actually have no idea.
[32:20.45]It was supposed to go live.
[32:22.71]I thought so.
[32:24.68]I can heal for you, Jumbo.
[32:25.86]Well, come on in.
[32:29.60]Alright, we got our group.
[32:30.86]So after this dungeon is done, a new group, I'm going to switch it out.
[32:34.58]Me and Stealth will stay and three more people will come in.
[32:38.81]What's up, TotallyRaging?
[32:39.67]Thanks for the sub.
[32:42.62]And let's go to... I believe it's Halls of Valor.
[32:46.36]We gotta kill Scovold.
[32:48.30]So the guys that are in this group right now, if you haven't done it, go get the quest from Khadgar.
[32:52.88]I was on this quest.
[32:57.25]Bad wants us to complete four dungeons on mythic difficulty.
[32:59.59]Sure.
[32:59.91]Thank you.
[33:01.70]Yeah, alright, let's do it.
[33:03.06]That's, like, perfect.
[33:03.64]Alright, what's my... I don't think we have... I got repair, but we'll be fine.
[33:09.08]Make your way to the Halls of Valor to go kill Scovold.
[33:17.76]And by the way, guys, like I said, we're going all day.
[33:20.79]This stream is not going to turn off for a long time.
[33:28.52]So is that the bonus or is that like the weekly thing?
[33:33.54]The thing you're talking about.
[33:34.32]Is that like the bonus quest thing we're dialing around here?
[33:37.87]Yeah.
[33:39.29]You just shared with me, so whatever.
[33:40.31]It doesn't matter.
[33:41.41]Yeah.
[33:41.61]Alright.
[33:42.69]Let's do it.
[33:47.78]Wait, wait.
[33:48.04]This guy's one of those things.
[33:50.22]No, no, no.
[33:50.78]Quick, quick, quick.
[33:51.18]Okay.
[33:57.95]The Halls of Valor.
[34:02.61]What is this?
[34:04.33]No.
[34:05.60]It just shows the... Comcast, is it going to turn this?
[34:10.00]No, actually, Comcast will not turn the stream off.
[34:16.18]Wait, what?
[34:17.90]Yeah, kill God King Skullbald.
[34:20.72]My internet is fixed.
[34:26.69]Heretic anchorite for nine months.
[34:28.23]I could have had nine bergs.
[34:31.23]You could have.
[34:34.39]But instead, I ate those nine bergs.
[34:37.81]For you.
[34:39.84]Yeah, shitty internet got fixed.
[34:42.16]They found the problem.
[34:42.84]They found the person that was causing all the issues.
[34:46.48]And I guess it's been completely resolved.
[34:50.04]I'm not going to say it's completely fixed.
[34:52.36]I don't know.
[34:52.88]I want to say that, but I was told it was fixed.
[34:57.44]And judging by all the... What the fuck?
[34:58.90]So many people just phased in.
[35:01.26]Judging by the amount of times I've done a speed test at night and all through the morning, I've been monitoring it all day, all night.
[35:08.12]It's been pretty solid.
[35:11.43]Yeah, a person was the problem.
[35:14.39]But thanks a lot, EtchTech.
[35:16.03]Welcome to the channel.
[35:17.19]Thanks for your sub.
[35:23.75]Yeah.
[35:25.09]I can just share it if nobody has it.
[35:27.58]I don't have that quest.
[35:30.38]Like a different one.
[35:32.20]I don't have that quest.
[35:32.98]No, you have it.
[35:33.30]You're on it.
[35:37.50]Have I played Battlefield 1?
[35:38.44]I have played Battlefield 1.
[35:41.08]And I'm... I never was a fan of Battlefield.
[35:44.47]I can't get into Battlefield.
[35:45.47]I've tried so many times.
[35:53.21]Yeah, somebody on my street was crashing the whole node.
[35:57.39]Somehow, through their faulty equipment or their messed up wiring, they were crashing the whole street.
[36:04.97]And they shut that guy off.
[36:13.73]God.
[36:14.55]I apologize in advance.
[36:17.66]MLC Stealth is going to be like a booga boy for the next 12 hours.
[36:20.94]So I'm sorry about that.
[36:29.40]The vanquishers have already done that, Scovold.
[36:34.30]They turned him off.
[36:41.55]Great crackles.
[36:44.47]They dealt with him.
[36:48.92]They took care of him.
[36:49.64]Oh, Stealth is behind me.
[36:50.46]Hi, Stealth.
[36:53.20]Hey, Stealth.
[36:54.64]Oh, you're on a broom.
[36:57.05]Hi.
[36:57.99]It sounds like I smoked so many cigarettes.
[37:03.75]Yeah, can you tell me to go get a cup of coffee, please?
[37:08.11]Go get me a cup of coffee.
[37:10.13]No, way thicker than that.
[37:14.54]I'd say now, quick.
[37:16.96]Oh, you want me to keep that voice?
[37:18.26]Yes.
[37:19.62]Keep the cough voice.
[37:22.34]Alright, so every time you cough, you blow out your microphone.
[37:24.58]So if you think you're gonna cough, can you just please God mute?
[37:29.30]When you cough, it's like... Like I'm getting electrocuted when you do that.
[37:33.04]Yeah.
[37:34.18]Yeah, I'll do that.
[37:39.75]Look at this party over here.
[37:42.99]How is every single person alliance here?
[37:47.93]Oh, whoops.
[37:49.51]Oh, party!
[37:52.76]Usually we're outnumbered like crazy.
[38:02.07]That joke is so old.
[38:02.95]Do we need to summon anybody?
[38:04.89]I don't think so.
[38:07.23]Gates of Valor.
[38:07.91]I don't know.
[38:08.43]Do we?
[38:09.33]Stormheim.
[38:11.53]How far away is this guy?
[38:13.03]Oh, yeah, we have... Yeah, no.
[38:16.37]Everyone's here.
[38:16.81]This guy's just running down the street.
[38:20.09]Summon me.
[38:21.56]Summon you?
[38:22.04]Where are you going?
[38:23.88]I want to go check my treasure chest box.
[38:26.08]Are you shitting me?
[38:26.74]I forgot to.
[38:28.16]I thought that was going to be this dumb, funny joke where you pretend to do it.
[38:31.42]Now I actually have to summon you.
[38:33.32]It'll take 10 seconds.
[38:36.22]Listen, I'm done talking to you.
[38:45.17]Does funny stuff happen in this game?
[38:46.91]Sometimes.
[38:48.79]Oh, there's so many LOL moments in this game.
[38:50.77]There really are.
[38:52.73]Like, for instance, over here, like, look at this bear.
[38:56.45]Wow, it turned, like, look, it turned from a bear to a person.
[39:00.25]LOL.
[39:00.55]Alright, there's so many stunning circles, I don't know which one is ours.
[39:10.36]I wish you could just click on any random person's one.
[39:12.38]There's too many people here.
[39:20.01]No, we have a warlock.
[39:21.42]I forgot.
[39:22.98]Dude, warlocks are so rare.
[39:24.48]I forgot that they existed and they could do that.
[39:27.56]We can summon you back in here.
[39:32.14]Warlocks are so non-existent.
[39:34.04]I forgot that they could summon people.
[39:39.98]No keystone.
[39:41.62]Let's just do normal mythic.
[39:48.93]Normal mythic.
[39:56.13]I'd say that hurt Jerma if it wasn't so true.
[39:59.51]Yeah.
[40:00.61]The thing is, how rare of a warlock are you?
[40:03.95]Are you affliction?
[40:05.41]Demonology?
[40:06.06]Like, if you're affliction, then you are the rarest of the rare.
[40:12.02]What is he?
[40:13.76]He's affliction.
[40:14.66]He's affliction.
[40:16.90]You are a shiny Pokémon.
[40:18.78]Can I capture him?
[40:23.23]Yeah, let's just go.
[40:25.63]Play Minesweeper?
[40:28.07]No, this is Warcraft Day.
[40:29.53]Because Karazhan came out.
[40:31.57]I'm going to be a fucking turd and play this game all day.
[40:36.08]I'm going to be a piece of absolute shit and play this game until the cows come home.
[40:40.86]By the way, what the hell does that even mean?
[40:49.35]I'm not using any cooldowns.
[40:52.19]This is so much easier...
[40:56.98]By the way, don't forget to loot body stealth, because we'd never do this shit.
[41:00.70]Oh yeah, it's not mythic plus.
[41:02.30]Yeah.
[41:04.46]We don't even need to interrupt these guys, do we?
[41:08.70]I guess we could if we really wanted to.
[41:20.83]Everything's so safe.
[41:24.25]Why don't we just do this every time?
[41:25.35]Why don't we even do the harder things?
[41:36.30]Mythic Dungeons.
[41:37.06]Oh, what an LOL moment.
[41:43.63]Top damage by a billion.
[41:45.95]Dude, what a fucking LOL moment.
[41:48.31]Look at that DPS.
[41:49.23]I don't even care I'm standing in this.
[41:50.82]Oh my gosh, I'm dying.
[41:51.86]I don't even care.
[41:53.82]Look at that DPS I had.
[41:54.72]Yeah, it was good.
[41:56.86]Just stand in all this shit.
[41:58.10]It doesn't even matter.
[42:04.38]See, it doesn't even fucking matter.
[42:06.12]I'm going like right back away.
[42:07.24]Like, fine.
[42:14.29]Dude, that was an LOL moment.
[42:23.73]Long have I awaited noble champions.
[42:27.62]Alright, now I won't fuck around now.
[42:29.64]I'll be real.
[42:33.24]You want to hero this or you want me to do it?
[42:35.50]You.
[42:37.30]Fine.
[42:41.93]Shit, I just did it.
[42:42.87]I did it.
[42:43.59]What the hell?
[42:50.45]What side is it on?
[42:55.97]Front.
[43:03.66]Let your worth be measured in blood.
[43:06.12]Let your worth be measured in blood.
[43:23.02]I am spent.
[43:24.34]I don't even want to use evocation.
[43:25.44]I don't even care.
[43:25.92]He's like almost dead.
[43:32.80]I'm just kind of standing here.
[43:35.70]I'm just standing around.
[43:36.68]I don't want to do it.
[43:37.80]I don't want to do it.
[43:38.93]I don't want to evocate.
[43:39.89]I want to save it for this next pull.
[43:43.17]I don't want to do it.
[43:44.43]I'm not going to do it.
[43:45.37]I refuse.
[43:45.95]You should do it.
[43:50.78]No.
[43:52.14]I'm not doing it.
[43:53.76]I didn't even do it.
[44:00.73]Honest to God, I was standing completely still there.
[44:11.64]I wasn't doing DPS for at least 10 seconds there.
[44:13.54]Because I want to be able to do this.
[44:38.13]Don't do that shit.
[44:42.41]Fire mage is for role players?
[44:46.71]No, this is not a keystone.
[44:47.81]This is just a normal mythic.
[44:49.86]That's why I'm being kind of a dickhead.
[44:51.54]I'm being sort of a dickie right now, but it's okay.
[45:17.23]We should probably interrupt.
[45:19.42]Yeah, we really should.
[45:20.20]We're in a really bad spot.
[45:30.05]I always hate to use Evocation.
[45:31.17]I don't know why.
[45:34.21]Unless it's, like, out of boss...
[45:44.01]I've been live for 45 minutes.
[45:45.41]I hope you guys are ready to add like 12 hours to that timer.
[45:48.67]For the first time ever.
[45:49.47]Alright, I'll interrupt.
[45:52.79]I'll interrupt.
[45:53.97]No more dicking around.
[45:54.77]I'll fucking interrupt this dude.
[45:56.27]I did it on the first one.
[46:10.99]Explosions.
[46:16.98]I haven't interrupted again.
[46:17.80]There he goes.
[46:21.04]Man, look how good.
[46:21.70]At least Shaman is.
[46:26.39]Navigation is just as bad as frickin' Lifetap.
[46:28.11]I just hate standing still for that long.
[46:31.35]It's annoying.
[46:32.13]It really is.
[46:33.21]Six full seconds of standing completely still is not fun.
[46:41.39]Thank you Jack954 for the sub.
[46:42.97]Welcome, dude.
[46:44.59]Thank you.
[46:51.04]Very much appreciate it.
[46:52.78]Dude, here comes this other guy.
[46:58.60]I'm going to interrupt this sentinel.
[46:59.84]I think I can spell steal the sentinels too.
[47:01.38]It's kind of funny.
[47:05.82]Let's see if I can get him.
[47:07.82]I'll take the free shit.
[47:14.68]Does he even do it on regular mythic?
[47:16.59]Yeah.
[47:21.92]I don't know.
[47:22.36]I need to put my pizza rolls in the oven though, so give me a sec.
[47:30.09]Oh, you got time.
[47:31.66]Oh, I know.
[47:32.46]Also, I'm having a lot of trouble with the arcane changes, it seems.
[47:37.18]So if you don't know, in this patch, arcane's mana costs for every spell got increased by pretty much 25%.
[47:43.44]So you burn through... They do more damage, but you burn through mana so much faster than yesterday.
[47:52.27]That sounds inconvenient.
[47:53.49]It's very inconvenient.
[47:57.09]It is as inconvenient as it possibly could be.
[48:00.86]You say bad mage, please kick.
[48:03.90]Permanent ban.
[48:08.55]Oh no, don't kill us.
[48:17.37]Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding.
[48:26.67]I don't have any more interrupts.
[48:28.03]It's up to you, buddy.
[48:37.45]Big pull.
[48:38.13]Did the arcane rotation change?
[48:40.97]I feel like it might a little bit, just because I wish they would just buff barrage.
[48:46.66]This move sucks so bad.
[48:48.48]If they made it do more damage or made it, like, not clear quickening, so many more people would not be, like, appalled by its use.
[48:58.09]Ah, shit.
[48:59.09]Oh, we got a dude.
[49:19.54]That thing give me it it's mine now I stole it from him Ban me I've been a very bad boy
[49:40.20]Okay, I'll interrupt him again.
[49:56.20]I don't even need to.
[50:02.88]Long have I awaited noble champions.
[50:04.79]I need to move this.
[50:06.70]Through great deeds of courage and valor, Herrscher has earned this most sacred of rights.
[50:13.21]She shall ascend as one of my chosen Valkyr, and her name shall echo in these gilded halls for all eternity.
[50:22.67]I'm nervous, Herrscher.
[50:24.19]It is understandable.
[50:26.88]No, I am not nervous.
[50:28.50]Only excited.
[50:29.52]Only excited.
[50:30.70]All my life has led to this one glorious moment.
[50:37.81]Did I say hi to these guys?
[50:38.77]Hi Cave Guy and Jack954.
[50:40.05]They subbed?
[50:40.45]Did I miss them?
[50:40.91]Probably.
[50:41.29]Welcome, guys.
[50:41.76]Welcome.
[50:42.42]What's up, Noodle Soup?
[50:43.52]Thanks to the Twitch Prime subscription.
[51:04.97]No, those things are going away.
[51:07.03]Is Twitch Prime, like, the free month kind of disappearing?
[51:09.75]Is that what's going to happen here?
[51:12.05]Oh, shit.
[51:12.41]Dugas.
[51:13.93]Help me.
[51:14.29]Dugas almost dead.
[51:18.76]You said hi.
[51:19.28]I'll never forget it.
[51:20.06]Well, hello again.
[51:27.32]Spoken like a true Valkyrie.
[51:36.45]Uh-oh.
[51:37.11]Thanks, Tim.
[51:38.04]Uh-oh.
[51:38.26]Uh-oh.
[51:42.06]Uh-oh!
[51:43.50]Just kill the aspirin.
[51:44.28]Uh...
[52:05.58]I cut that off short, but yeah, we're good.
[52:07.50]We're fine.
[52:08.16]Don't worry.
[52:14.99]You refunded your Twitch Prime subscription, but you let it keep your sub?
[52:18.07]That's weird.
[52:23.29]I'll lose empty slots, but once you have emotes, they don't go away.
[52:26.35]Oh, that's good.
[52:27.85]So if you, like, go back down... I found a new group.
[52:32.07]This group died.
[52:33.11]Yeah.
[52:37.48]Alright, let's kill these guys quick.
[52:42.08]Don't do hero here, it would be a waste.
[52:43.72]Actually, would it be?
[52:44.34]Who knows.
[52:44.68]Yes.
[52:45.88]Spoken like a truth out here.
[53:10.30]Yeah, I don't want to evocate here.
[53:14.90]So I won't.
[53:22.67]You need to add emotes to lock them in.
[53:28.97]Okay.
[53:30.63]I got a guy making all my emotes right now.
[53:36.67]So hopefully before the Twitch Prime subs kind of retrial ones go away.
[53:44.42]I'll be able to lock them in.
[53:45.66]I wish I had Ice Flows right there.
[53:53.14]That sucked.
[53:58.86]Episode 4 of Sorcery?
[54:00.40]Yeah, very well could be.
[54:16.43]as he's dead come on come on get me out of combat so I can drink speaking of drinking and eating pizza rolls probably should eat these pizza rolls five minutes until they're ready I'm not even I'm not attacking until my pizza rolls are done my pizza rolls are ready time to go let's take a look at that arcane dps
[55:00.02]Begone from these hallowed halls!
[55:04.56]Just too far away.
[55:18.67]Are you kidding me?
[55:24.43]Begone from these hallowed halls!
[55:32.43]The storm gathers.
[55:33.97]Strike now, Herrscher.
[55:37.93]No, don't lose quickening.
[55:39.11]Don't lose quickening.
[55:46.54]I am sorry.
[55:48.24]I have failed you.
[55:50.36]Nothing.
[55:52.92]What the hell is that?
[55:54.24]Recipe.
[55:56.22]Yeah.
[55:59.61]Being out-deeped by Elemental Shaman?
[56:02.05]Well, we're both the shitty specs.
[56:03.83]It's okay.
[56:05.39]Your spec is high on the DPS.
[56:07.65]No, it isn't.
[56:08.03]Uh-huh.
[56:09.23]Arcane Mage?
[56:10.65]Yeah.
[56:10.87]Let me show you the logs.
[56:14.12]The logs?
[56:16.92]Arcane is like mid to low.
[56:19.90]Don't need the logs.
[56:24.42]I beat you in that fight, so excuse me.
[56:32.49]They're probably the same at this point.
[56:34.11]What do I think about that?
[56:41.93]Show the logs.
[56:43.41]Let me see those logs.
[56:49.81]Arcane is top, but only if you're good.
[56:52.03]Arcane Mage, number four right now in the 75th percentile.
[56:56.77]From when?
[56:58.00]Here are the logs, Jerma.
[56:58.90]Just look at them, okay?
[57:00.22]What the hell are you talking about?
[57:01.42]Have you been doing drugs again?
[57:04.41]Yeah.
[57:04.61]A lot of cigarettes.
[57:06.45]I'll show you some logs.
[57:24.22]Better look at those logs.
[57:32.26]Yeah, I'll post logs to the chat.
[57:37.25]Oh, good, good tab targeting, Blizzard.
[57:39.41]Good, great, great tab targeting, Blizzard.
[57:41.51]I really love your tab targeting.
[57:46.15]You know, like the guy that was right next to the fucking guy that I was attacking?
[57:49.77]Pull the whole table to the right behind me.
[57:51.89]Alright, I was posting the logs and I looked up and we've got this whole room full.
[58:07.24]Logs.
[58:07.70]Hey, you wanna see some logs?
[58:11.48]Look in the toilet.
[58:23.23]That Frostmage though.
[58:41.58]Thanks a lot, CrashW1995.
[58:42.58]An illusion.
[59:08.71]My itemization isn't really that great right now either.
[59:10.79]That's another thing.
[59:13.38]I need to be at, like, 50% mastery and, like, 25 plus percent crit.
[59:19.22]I have a lot of, like, useless gear that just needs to go away.
[59:21.44]Hopefully I get some in Karazin.
[59:39.43]I don't have a target.
[59:42.31]Of course I do.
[59:50.28]I think the main problem is they have a long ramp up so dungeons are kind of bad since they die quickly.
[59:57.21]Arcane's always had a problem with being consistent just because... I'm always at least 5-10 seconds late to every single fight in a dungeon because of this dumb shit that I have to do right here.
[60:08.74]I don't care what a fucking log says.
[60:16.16]You're number four.
[60:16.72]Get over yourself.
[60:18.62]What is this even from?
[60:21.14]World of Warcraft.
[60:23.00]When did this come out?
[60:25.42]That's World of Warcraft, Jerma.
[60:26.52]When is that from?
[60:26.90]I just looked it up.
[60:27.68]What the hell?
[60:28.56]Is that from today?
[60:29.30]7.1?
[60:29.32]This morning?
[60:29.58]I don't know.
[60:29.92]I looked yesterday also.
[60:31.12]Listen, I'm getting my pizza rolls now.
[60:50.19]I'm sure it is good.
[60:53.23]But for Arcane to be good, the fight has to go on for like three to five minutes.
[60:57.89]Arcane is the best spec in the game.
[61:01.73]Hey, how about you stuff it up your ass?
[61:04.10]Might as well switch to Fire Mage.
[61:05.24]Hey, why don't you take those pizza rolls and fucking shove them up your ass?
[61:20.42]They're too hot for that.
[61:27.09]They're a little cooler.
[61:27.93]You want to check the date?
[61:30.63]What date is it?
[61:31.15]Check the log to see what date today is.
[62:06.85]Abraham Lincoln didn't die just so you can ignore the logs.
[62:10.23]Also, I'm not like 100% paying attention at the moment.
[62:18.25]Because obviously I'm like reading chat and talking to you guys every now and then.
[62:29.18]The one thing I do know about Arcane is it is extremely punishing.
[62:32.48]Like, if you fuck up the rotation even for a quarter of a second, you're going to- it's fucking terrible.
[62:41.56]Alright, I got my sprite, I got my pizza rolls.
[62:44.75]Ready to help play World of Warcraft.
[62:46.85]Where the hell have you been?
[62:51.99]Where the hell have you been?
[62:53.87]I've been here.
[62:54.39]I guess we're clearing all of Fenrir's puppies before we fight Fenrir.
[62:57.78]Yeah, this is just regular Mythic.
[62:59.28]We don't have a timer around us.
[63:14.94]Somebody pulled a deer.
[63:16.54]Oh shit, a deer.
[63:18.32]Oh gosh.
[63:22.88]Here comes another wolf.
[63:32.08]It's time to fucking party.
[63:36.34]It's time to drink.
[63:42.98]I was really sad that in 7.1 they didn't add, like, being able to move and drink out of combat.
[63:50.17]Really wish they... They need to add that for Arcane.
[63:51.83]It's so annoying.
[63:55.03]Mana management just needs to be addressed.
[63:57.87]Because it's so stupid having to sit down on my ass after every single pull in the game.
[64:06.67]Wait, what?
[64:08.41]Get those fritters.
[64:10.88]Welcome back, IMF.
[64:12.16]And thank you, SukaBullYacht, for your subscription.
[64:14.98]SukaBullYacht.
[64:18.12]Thanks a lot, dude.
[64:28.86]Get a sippy cup, Pat.
[64:30.12]I know, I really need one.
[64:36.52]I really desperately need a sippy cup.
[64:49.37]Whoa.
[64:49.96]Why is this lagging?
[64:52.62]It's happening like a full half second after I do my move.
[64:54.80]What is going on here?
[65:11.60]Alright, we don't need to kill this many walls.
[65:12.79]What are we doing?
[65:13.25]We've already passed Fenrir.
[65:14.03]Yeah, we passed him.
[65:19.47]We don't need to do this.
[65:22.13]Experience points.
[65:27.63]Oh shit, this tank's gonna die.
[65:29.25]Not sure if the tank's... ...does what he's doing, really.
[65:33.84]It's okay.
[65:36.50]We have no pressure right now, so it's fine.
[65:38.22]We're gonna be fine.
[65:44.62]Next spot.
[65:47.70]Then go to that spot.
[65:50.08]So it goes to every spot?
[65:51.27]I don't know.
[65:55.01]The mighty Fenrir stalks these grounds.
[66:05.33]Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.
[66:10.53]Come on now, drink.
[66:19.27]Is this cookie clicker?
[66:20.19]Yeah, it's cookie clicker to Legion.
[66:24.55]The search for more cookies.
[66:30.45]I do not have the hidden artifact appearance.
[66:32.73]I wish I did, though, because it's hilarious.
[66:35.57]It is hilarious.
[66:52.92]It is a very, very funny thing.
[67:16.82]There he goes.
[67:22.10]There he goes.
[67:25.64]The Arcane Hidden's a huge... Yeah, it's a huge pain in the ass.
[67:28.50]Don't you have to go polymorph, like, a very specific amount of fucking animals?
[67:32.73]And then eventually, after you polymorph, like, these eight different animals, there's, like, a 1% chance when you go to your class hall that randomly it'll be there?
[67:40.75]Doesn't sound all too fun to me.
[67:42.26]There's one little wolf kind of straight over here.
[67:58.90]One stray wolf pup.
[68:06.25]Oh no!
[68:06.75]There's a lot of waiting.
[68:21.99]That's, yeah.
[68:23.05]That's like, kind of annoying.
[68:41.76]The mighty Fenrir.
[68:43.90]Oh my god, I got a thing.
[68:47.22]You have earned my blessing, champion.
[68:49.58]Does anyone need that?
[68:50.56]Do you guys need that in the game right now?
[69:02.57]If you need it, you can just have it.
[69:04.31]I don't need it.
[69:04.71]Do you ever need to drink?
[69:09.43]You're right.
[69:13.46]Fuck, I was doing a stupid joke and I pulled a boss.
[69:15.98]Not the boss, I pulled this ape.
[69:17.67]This is not an ape, I pulled this dragon.
[69:19.21]My fucking god, I can't stream and, like, play this game and talk at the same time.
[69:23.75]I just called this two different animals.
[69:27.83]I just called this two separate fucking animals, and it's a dragon.
[69:33.82]It's an ape.
[69:34.84]It's a chicken.
[69:37.90]Oh, it's a coffee.
[69:38.76]Woohoo.
[69:46.76]You're drunk.
[69:48.28]Not this early.
[69:49.72]Not this early.
[69:58.70]Oh, no.
[69:59.40]Two champions.
[70:14.17]I was skiing around.
[70:21.35]God, I love skiing.
[70:24.01]Like this.
[70:24.31]Just running around in circles.
[70:30.63]Like the guy on the... Yeah, this guy.
[70:42.53]Exploded.
[70:45.81]What server am I on?
[70:46.55]I'm on Shadowmoon.
[70:56.69]Shadow Moon.
[70:58.97]Was US East, now it's US Central, I believe.
[71:08.62]It's a chicken.
[71:10.84]Try out action camera.
[71:12.96]It's almost like Dark Soul-ish.
[71:17.73]I'll try it out after this.
[71:18.63]I don't want to do it in a dungeon and just be useless.
[71:20.41]Because when I see new things like that, it freaks me out.
[71:25.16]Never trust purple, thanks for the bits, dude.
[71:26.67]It's a fucking Jerva stream?
[71:30.61]Thanks, dude.
[71:34.93]Stealth, why aren't you talking?
[71:36.39]People are like, where's Stealth?
[71:37.40]Is he alright?
[71:37.88]Is he sick?
[71:38.32]Is he okay?
[71:42.20]What?
[71:42.76]What?
[71:44.32]Were you actually talking to me?
[71:47.10]Like, 4%, yeah.
[71:51.44]I'm just muted and mouth breathing as I eat all these pizza rolls.
[71:57.96]I'm breathing so loudly as I eat these.
[71:59.86]My nose doesn't work right now.
[72:01.73]Oh, God!
[72:02.23]The game crashed!
[72:05.35]I'm out.
[72:06.85]Bye.
[72:07.49]What the fuck?
[72:09.55]Okay, no, I'm not even kidding.
[72:10.69]Don't press Z, ever.
[72:12.64]Z?
[72:13.12]Don't press Z. I'm pressing it.
[72:14.80]Don't press W and Z at the same time.
[72:18.06]Oh, that's fine.
[72:21.13]Fuck it, I got a Q!
[72:24.25]Fuck it, I have a Q to get in!
[72:25.60]I'm going back to... Go, go, go, go, go!
[72:29.02]...eating.
[72:29.24]Alright, I'm back.
[72:34.66]Yeah, for you guys watching, if you have Legion, if you have this patch, Boo said it happened to him as well.
[72:41.08]If you press Z, sometimes the game just turns off.
[72:46.67]Don't ask me why the hell that happens.
[72:48.63]Wow, that's gonna show up on the logs.
[72:53.22]You guys really like this log joke.
[73:00.36]I just want to say, is there any way for you to preserve your sorcery streams?
[73:12.57]They're a treasure and need to be kept around.
[73:14.19]I have all of them.
[73:16.81]So, yes.
[73:19.54]I have every single sorcery stream I've ever done.
[73:27.09]Zoraxos the Demon Hunter?
[73:28.55]Oh yeah, I forgot that's his name.
[73:33.09]Our tank is dead?
[73:33.81]Where is he?
[73:38.60]Uh-oh.
[73:39.16]Did he press Z?
[73:39.84]I think he pressed Z on his keyboard.
[73:42.12]I hope he did.
[73:42.64]I hope he comes back and says, sorry, I pressed Z to see if it was real.
[73:54.83]Did you press Z?
[74:04.31]I did right before you... Wow.
[74:07.53]He actually did.
[74:10.15]Don't press Z. I'm telling you guys.
[74:11.81]It's a fucking... It's not good.
[74:13.79]Don't press it.
[74:23.40]We do... We have to interrupt something.
[74:25.06]One of these guys do.
[74:29.51]Who cares about that guy?
[74:32.57]Oh, that's what it was.
[74:33.19]Yeah, and I didn't do it.
[74:43.75]I didn't press Z. By the way, do you guys see the names?
[75:00.39]These guys are Tor and Bjorn.
[75:03.87]Blizzard really ramping up their inside jokes right here.
[75:06.72]Tor and Bjorn.
[75:15.96]The vanquishers have already taken a hold of it.
[75:18.28]Scovold.
[75:19.18]I have to do that every time I come in here.
[75:24.04]When did I start playing WoW?
[75:25.20]10 years ago?
[75:26.24]12 years ago?
[75:31.70]I feel like a fool for noticing what?
[75:35.66]He said it.
[75:36.20]Yes.
[75:36.58]They're from Utgard.
[75:37.56]Keep Torbjörn.
[75:37.96]Yes.
[76:02.59]Or die.
[76:03.25]Who dares summon me?
[76:11.45]Give up the Aegis or die.
[76:33.38]Wee-hoo!
[77:09.36]Give up the Aegis or die.
[77:29.65]And there goes Dax.
[77:31.15]They're all gone.
[77:31.95]Now the Aegis is where it belongs.
[77:55.85]That's actually really, really good.
[78:00.29]Damn.
[78:01.21]That thing's fucking amazing.
[78:02.35]Grats, dude.
[78:03.45]An 850.
[78:13.50]How are the classes in 7.1?
[78:16.02]I think they're all good.
[78:23.23]Some of them are really, like, undertuned and odd.
[78:27.59]But for the most part, I like the artifact design.
[78:29.63]I like the design of most of the classes.
[78:36.58]Alright, I will interrupt the first one.
[78:43.21]I'll get the first one.
[78:56.87]Oh boy, I'm not gonna be able to make this.
[79:18.48]Everybody has a weakness.
[79:19.92]And let's go!
[79:20.44]Oh fuck, come on, really?
[79:49.79]We did it!
[79:50.13]Let the battle begin.
[79:50.69]Stomp, slap, slap, stomp.
[79:52.72]Oh my god.
[79:57.48]A lot of shit was in here.
[80:19.31]We have a bonus event.
[80:20.47]The final boss of each Legion dungeon will drop an extra item.
[80:24.12]Alright, cool.
[80:28.14]Very cool.
[80:33.84]This is all this crap.
[80:35.26]Does anybody need this in here?
[80:36.64]Actually, no.
[80:38.73]No, I don't.
[80:40.67]And if you guys need this, you can have it if you want.
[80:52.71]Nobody need the cloak.
[80:56.72]Somebody just wrote, hey, Jerma, fuck you.
[80:58.24]What the heck, man?
[81:05.70]Yes, you can take it.
[81:13.72]There you go.
[81:15.48]I will port you guys to Dalaran.
[81:20.94]Thanks for playing.
[81:21.44]Thanks for coming out.
[81:23.91]Good luck with the rest of your attunement.
[81:28.35]It was one of your subs.
[81:35.03]What is Michael's last name from the Rat Movie 2?
[81:40.25]I'm pretty sure it was like... Michael Gregory, I think.
[81:45.99]You sucks.
[81:49.12]Thanks a lot, Brew.
[81:49.76]Thanks for coming out, man.
[81:51.04]Thanks a lot, Rambone.
[81:54.49]Alright.
[81:56.27]The next one is, I believe... Where do we have to go next for the attunement?
[82:05.49]Yeah, thanks for playing, guys.
[82:06.53]I'm going to make a new party, new people.
[82:16.05]Alright.
[82:16.53]So next we're going to...
[82:21.43]Bring the Fel Crystal Fragment.
[82:22.77]Okay, we go to Khadgar.
[82:33.16]Yeah, he's Prince Dugas.
[82:37.32]Oh, action camera time.
[82:38.22]Okay.
[82:38.96]So, what is it?
[82:39.68]Slash... What was it?
[82:40.80]Slash action camera or something?
[82:41.78]Isn't it options?
[82:46.16]Yes, I will.
[82:49.83]Yes, I will.
[82:51.31]What's going on?
[82:51.95]Jewelies?
[82:53.55]Jewels?
[82:55.17]Jewels?
[82:55.55]I'm going to see what's jewels.
[83:01.57]So we need for whatever the next one is.
[83:03.91]We'll see.
[83:06.17]Console action cam.
[83:07.93]Okay.
[83:17.66]An option?
[83:26.81]Like this?
[83:27.11]You have to write in the brackets too?
[83:28.17]Is it like you have to put like a T for true or false or something?
[83:36.58]Usually, how do you do it?
[83:38.20]Z for action.
[83:38.82]Oh, I almost pressed it.
[83:39.88]You almost got me to press Z. Okay, now it opened up.
[83:46.78]Holy shit, that's a lot of artifact power.
[83:53.45]Tank the next dungeon.
[83:54.39]Yes, you can.
[84:01.16]And here's our DPS.
[84:05.32]Demon Hunter tank, cool.
[84:07.78]It's slash dance.
[84:08.80]It isn't console action.
[84:10.76]Isn't it console action camera on?
[84:20.34]Oh boy.
[84:24.40]Whoa.
[84:29.05]This is pretty cool.
[84:32.90]What?
[84:33.60]This is awesome.
[84:37.52]Why did I never know about this before?
[84:40.20]It's like a legit third-person camera.
[84:42.45]And it goes out... Oh, that's cool looking.
[84:48.53]I'm going to use this for a little while.
[84:49.95]I'll see if it gets on my nerves.
[84:54.32]It's going to spawn 100 EZP's.
[84:59.33]Thanks a lot, Todd.
[85:00.85]Thanks a lot for your 400 bits, Todd.
[85:02.39]You're my second favorite streamer.
[85:03.83]Well, I'm happy to be on your list of any favorite streamers.
[85:06.53]So thanks, man.
[85:08.80]I'm going to be right back in a couple of minutes.
[85:11.00]Yeah.
[85:11.84]Take your time.
[85:12.18]I'm going to go check on Mariah.
[85:13.42]Stay here.
[85:13.96]Yeah.
[85:16.08]Everyone else in the world put into one category is my favorite.
[85:18.90]My first favorite.
[85:19.96]Oh, wow.
[85:21.66]Oh, my God.
[85:24.42]So that means I'm like the worst person in the world to you.
[85:31.29]Thanks nonetheless, dude.
[85:37.78]It's over the right shoulder.
[85:41.84]That is pretty cool, though.
[85:51.12]Yeah, by the way, we're going all day, guys.
[85:53.23]I ain't going to stop this stream until we beat Karazhan.
[85:55.23]That might be like 10 o'clock at night.
[85:58.43]I have no idea.
[86:05.03]It's really awesome if you're melee.
[86:06.23]Yeah, that actually would be awesome.
[86:08.11]Jumping around as melee, being able to keep it.
[86:09.71]I wish it was where you could keep it.
[86:10.67]Because I always turn with my mouse when I hold the right mouse button.
[86:17.40]Thanks for letting us join in on the mythic.
[86:18.70]Would love to see more WoW stuff with viewers.
[86:20.92]Well, thanks, Dr. Dadma.
[86:23.00]Yeah, I... Anytime that I kind of just feel like turning on and playing WoW and doing dungeons and stuff, I would absolutely open it up to viewers every time.
[86:33.94]Click on people?
[86:39.94]I don't play with music.
[86:40.68]It distracts me.
[86:43.60]Add to another list of things that cause my brain to turn off when I play a game.
[86:47.69]That's one of them.
[86:49.63]But let me see while stealth is gone.
[86:51.35]You know what we could do?
[86:54.69]While stealth is gone, I'm just going to go kill the world boss.
[86:57.99]Where is he?
[86:58.58]High Mountain?
[86:58.92]Yeah, don't tell stealth I did this.
[87:02.46]That's what he gets for being BRB.
[87:06.00]Maybe I'll wait.
[87:06.80]Eh.
[87:09.76]I'll just wait, fine.
[87:10.60]Let me turn off, uh, guild chat.
[87:17.68]So what dungeon is up next?
[87:18.66]It would be... Let's see, we have a list of a few we can do.
[87:25.00]Okay, we can either do... Whatever you guys feel like doing in the group.
[87:29.04]Blackrock Hold, Violet Hold, or Vault of the Wardens.
[87:36.28]Well, I mean, we're, like, standing right here.
[87:37.52]I guess we could just do, uh...
[87:42.34]The violet hold.
[87:47.42]I made the mistake of listening to music while playing games for a while, so I've since kicked the habit of being able to focus a lot better.
[87:52.22]Yeah, I'm so distractible.
[87:57.13]I have to just zone out and play a game for me to focus and play well.
[88:05.77]I have a three hour class at 430.
[88:07.27]Feels bad.
[88:07.95]Make sure you don't die.
[88:09.07]Make sure you die a lot and make no progress during that time.
[88:11.93]We probably will.
[88:19.13]We're just doing straight up normal mythic dungeons.
[88:20.68]It's for a quest line.
[88:21.34]It's for the attunement for Karazhan.
[88:23.90]I refuse to do Violet Hold.
[88:25.50]Alright, well then let's... What was the other one?
[88:29.26]Vault of the Wardens.
[88:29.96]We can do Vault if you want.
[88:33.28]Let's do Vault.
[88:34.22]Vault of the Wardens.
[88:39.73]Wow, straight up refusal.
[88:43.55]What the heck is Karazhan?
[88:44.75]Karazhan is the new dungeon that came out in 7.1.
[88:49.59]It is a reimagining of the original dungeon which came out in 2007 for the game.
[88:58.51]So this is the... Okay, that's the emissary one.
[89:01.07]You just do four and you get a free bonus.
[89:02.87]Fucking bonus spin.
[89:05.23]Dude, I know all about bonus spins.
[89:09.20]Sometimes I go to the casino.
[89:10.48]You drop like 20 bucks in one of those machines.
[89:12.86]Pull it a bunch of times.
[89:13.84]Ding.
[89:14.38]Ding.
[89:15.18]Ding.
[89:15.78]Bonus.
[89:17.02]You get like 10 free bonus spins.
[89:18.98]I know all about that shit.
[89:27.36]Vault it is.
[89:28.18]Okay.
[89:28.90]Let's do it.
[89:33.97]Anybody join?
[89:34.51]As long as you have, like, eye level 830, I would say.
[89:37.61]Just so we can... It's pretty much a lock-in that will get it done.
[89:41.23]Alright, I'm back.
[89:42.37]Hey.
[89:42.61]I actually have not checked out the Blood Trader.
[89:46.64]That's a good, uh... Hello?
[89:48.40]I can hear you.
[89:50.22]Hello?
[89:50.68]Hello?
[89:51.32]Hi.
[89:52.10]How long have I been muted for?
[89:53.72]Forever.
[89:55.32]Your whole life.
[89:56.14]Why didn't you say something?
[89:57.96]I did.
[89:59.18]No, I said hello.
[90:01.09]Hello?
[90:01.39]Hello?
[90:04.43]Where are we going?
[90:06.03]Vault of the Wardens.
[90:07.77]Oh, okay.
[90:08.39]I'll let you guys.
[90:09.23]You're already there.
[90:09.75]Alright.
[90:14.06]I'm going to watch Hulu and I'm going to mute you and TeamSpeak and everything.
[90:17.66]You're just going to play?
[90:20.20]Yeah.
[90:21.14]I got to watch the new episode of WWE Monday Night Raw.
[90:24.46]Next week is No Mercy.
[90:26.46]Sorry.
[90:26.96]Next week is Hell in a Cell.
[90:28.10]No Mercy was the latest pay-per-view.
[90:30.80]Guess who's going to Hell in a Cell?
[90:32.86]What?
[90:33.14]Burgah Boy.
[90:33.74]Me.
[90:35.00]Wait, really?
[90:35.54]Yeah, dude, on Halloween.
[90:36.60]Why?
[90:36.86]Why have you not told me?
[90:38.78]Because I wanted it to be a surprise.
[90:41.08]Are you actually?
[90:42.38]Yeah.
[90:45.41]I swear to God.
[90:46.77]How are you?
[90:47.57]Who are you going with?
[90:48.93]A bunch of dudes.
[90:49.65]Burger Boys, one of them.
[90:50.91]A couple of other buddies that you probably have never heard of.
[90:53.83]Oh, I've heard of all your buddies.
[90:55.25]Tell me their names.
[90:55.76]What are their names?
[90:56.24]Are you going with John?
[90:57.38]John.
[90:58.24]Jason.
[90:59.62]John.
[91:00.00]Steve.
[91:00.38]Jehoshaphat.
[91:01.22]Jebediah.
[91:02.91]Oh, it is in Boston, yeah.
[91:04.11]Yeah, it's in Boston this year.
[91:07.33]Do you have an extra ticket?
[91:08.35]I'll fly off there.
[91:10.03]Who, like, brought this guy over here?
[91:12.43]I'm going to be watching it.
[91:14.88]I'm going to be watching you.
[91:16.68]I'm going to make sure I get on camera.
[91:22.86]Why couldn't I click this?
[91:24.04]Is somebody, like, closing this door?
[91:29.37]That is him.
[91:29.79]Are we all here?
[91:33.43]Alright guys, good luck!
[91:35.07]Have fun!
[91:36.53]Stay wonderful!
[91:48.53]I know. Like yeah. Like you're linking logs and shit. This is just regular, fun mythics. We're just chilling, dude.
[91:53.53]I'm gonna put on my keystone to piss you guys off.
[91:57.53]Don't do that. Cause then we can't do the quest.
[92:00.63]I still have action camera on, by the way.
[92:02.13]It's actually pretty cool.
[92:04.29]Does it do?
[92:05.17]Take a look at the stream.
[92:07.01]It widens your FOV and shows a ton more vertical.
[92:09.85]Looks exactly the same.
[92:13.77]No, it doesn't.
[92:14.71]Oh, okay.
[92:15.13]I see.
[92:17.81]Let's see if I like it or not.
[92:18.99]Your character's not in the center of the screen.
[92:20.43]You're in the bottom part of it.
[92:22.22]Yeah.
[92:23.02]I'll try it for a little bit.
[92:25.90]Stream lag makes this very confusing.
[92:31.25]Alright, we're about to make our first pool in this dungeon.
[92:34.21]This is weird.
[92:35.01]This is weird.
[92:35.91]I don't know if I can handle this.
[92:38.37]It's really odd.
[92:39.31]I feel like I'm not playing the character that I am.
[92:44.67]I'm watching somebody else play.
[92:51.42]Did I pull these guys?
[92:53.28]A fucking action cam.
[92:55.50]I'm like pulling people with action cam.
[93:04.09]I don't even get off my mark either.
[93:10.44]Yeah, I don't know.
[93:11.16]I'm not sure I want to keep it on.
[93:13.28]It's kind of fucking with my brain.
[93:14.52]I feel like I'm to the right with Dugas's.
[93:24.29]Yeah, you're not even centered.
[93:27.21]You're like off into the... That's weird.
[93:30.17]I'll wait.
[93:30.95]After the first boss, I'll turn it off.
[93:35.35]That is weird.
[93:35.77]Motion sickness simulator.
[93:39.99]Can I say, vanquish the darkness?
[93:43.40]Vanquish the darkness.
[93:45.26]Vanquish the darkness.
[93:47.70]I don't need to say that.
[93:53.96]Thank you, ItWerewolf, for your subscription.
[93:55.85]Welcome to.
[93:56.67]And thank you to Mikey Smith as well for the bits.
[94:04.04]It's getting, like, a little closer.
[94:13.64]It's really weird.
[94:17.60]Oh, it is kind of making me sick.
[94:19.99]I'm not going to lie.
[94:20.71]It really is.
[94:21.27]I feel like I'm going to throw up.
[94:25.91]It's super cool, though.
[94:26.91]It's just too bad that I... No, don't cast Mark of Elanith right now.
[94:35.33]I gotta turn it off.
[94:42.64]Shit, now it's console.
[94:48.96]Okay, there we go.
[94:49.46]Yeah, it's a little too much for my brain to hit it.
[94:52.62]Cool that it's in the game now, though.
[94:55.38]Very, very cool.
[95:08.80]And start the machine gun.
[95:19.64]What doesn't make me puke?
[95:21.12]There's a whole lot that doesn't, but there's a whole lot that does.
[95:35.09]There's a whole lot that makes me just shit my pants, too.
[95:38.02]Like chili.
[95:39.20]God, I shit my pants if I eat chili.
[95:42.90]I puke and shit my pants if I have chili.
[95:46.88]It's not good.
[95:59.27]No, stun!
[96:19.39]He's puking right now.
[96:22.19]A4, Skinicus.
[96:24.71]Play Dota?
[96:25.27]I want to see you lose.
[96:26.25]Oh, I could never play Dota.
[96:28.87]Dota League, those games I couldn't do.
[96:31.23]Can't do it.
[96:33.61]As much as I would like to play a game like that.
[96:37.75]That doesn't interrupt that move, will it?
[96:42.47]I will serve my people.
[96:44.93]The exiled and the reviled.
[96:47.07]I will slay you and...
[96:49.95]How's my stomach these days?
[96:50.87]Actually pretty damn good.
[96:53.54]Very good.
[96:54.56]I got on a new medication like a year ago and changed my life.
[97:02.21]Not even kidding.
[97:03.21]Changed my fucking life.
[97:18.65]You don't have to brag.
[97:19.39]Rage!
[97:19.73]Ah!
[97:40.03]That guy died too fast.
[97:40.93]Hell relic.
[97:41.15]I need new relics so terribly.
[97:42.87]Oh, people are asking what class I am.
[97:44.25]Yeah, I have two 835s, I think.
[97:45.97]It fucking gets me every time, I swear to God.
[97:47.41]I keep thinking that somebody is in a call doing that to me.
[98:09.21]Oh no, that's me.
[98:14.28]Hey, Boo is online.
[98:15.28]Do you think that means Boo is going to join us?
[98:19.32]Okay, pull the whole room.
[98:20.66]Hey Tank, if you can hear me, pull the whole fucking room.
[98:23.64]I need to show MLC Stealth that I'm the fucking best DPS.
[98:27.67]Pull the fucking whole room.
[98:30.53]I don't even care if it gets us killed.
[98:37.79]He's gonna be like, alright.
[98:38.67]He hears me now and goes and does it.
[98:43.77]He's doing it.
[98:44.27]Go.
[98:44.49]Do it.
[98:51.57]I have to prove it.
[98:54.50]Hey, y'all died too fast.
[98:55.46]I couldn't prove it.
[98:57.42]They're not proven.
[98:58.06]Uh-oh.
[99:09.01]But... What'd you do?
[99:14.97]Oh my god, I fell in the hole!
[99:16.89]I scared you guys.
[99:22.04]You guys were all like, oh, typical Dremel.
[99:23.82]Stupid idiot!
[99:30.52]Oh, I hate this guy so much.
[99:32.09]I hate this boss.
[99:33.55]More than anything.
[99:37.01]The action cam Nazi reminds me of the first week playing F-Zero GX.
[99:40.80]Zalgar.
[99:43.92]What was that thing that just was like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[99:54.17]Bind an important ability to Z. Flap.
[99:59.55]Flap.
[100:01.19]Stupid idiot.
[100:02.77]Stop calling me a stupid idiot, guys.
[100:04.85]What if I called you a stupid idiot?
[100:06.19]You wouldn't be very happy about it, would you?
[100:11.11]I take it easy, Lime.
[100:12.61]I'll be going all day, so I'm sure I'll probably see you later.
[100:20.45]Are we just going to do the thing where we just tank them and just don't even care and just tank them in the hallway?
[100:24.88]Isn't that a strat?
[100:26.52]No, it's not a thing.
[100:28.84]How come me and Boo did it like two weeks ago and it worked
[100:32.49]Excellent.
[100:33.01]Yeah, why don't you show them the logs on that one?
[100:39.83]Yeah, that's what they want to do.
[100:44.40]We get over there and we look into the center of the room.
[100:49.04]Ah.
[100:50.20]Your soul shall be mine.
[101:04.32]Yeah, see?
[101:05.92]We just stay over here.
[101:16.49]We're supposed to just stay here.
[101:20.85]This is the fucking most annoying fight in the world.
[101:36.27]I just got comboed in the air.
[101:39.87]Oh my god.
[101:42.03]Back to the drawing board, Blizzard.
[101:43.17]This guy sucks.
[101:44.20]I'm stuck in the corner.
[101:47.62]I haven't been able to even do anything.
[101:48.78]Oh my god.
[101:52.62]I'm going to fucking smash my keyboard in half at this boss.
[101:57.04]Hey, have fun playing against the boss.
[101:59.92]I've been bounced around every five seconds.
[102:06.18]Why am I getting fucking killed?
[102:09.90]I can't even attack.
[102:10.62]I'm dead.
[102:11.70]I can't even do anything.
[102:12.90]I'm dead.
[102:13.56]Bye.
[102:16.73]Your souls are mine.
[102:24.81]Fuck this boss.
[102:32.42]Your souls are mine.
[102:39.38]I usually don't have that bad of a problem with him, but I was just getting comboed.
[102:49.31]We've done this guy on, like, Mythic plus five.
[102:51.75]And didn't have this much trouble.
[102:52.77]He just sometimes... I'm getting knocked around, too.
[102:54.59]This guy's just a piece of shit.
[102:55.83]This is the worst boss in the whole game.
[103:04.04]Your soul.
[103:06.42]It follows some of the Blizzard philosophies of fill the room with shit, spam moves in the whole room, and have like three things that are disorienting you the whole time.
[103:17.99]Apparently in Legion, for some reason, Blizzard's philosophy was put on a fucking helmet and shake the person's head in the helmet.
[103:29.30]Put a fishbowl over somebody's head and just fucking shake them around.
[103:36.90]Oh, nice.
[103:37.36]Cool.
[103:43.85]Kick the mage.
[103:48.95]Hey, look.
[103:49.59]This guy has that thing.
[103:50.85]Come over here.
[103:54.63]Visit Jules.
[103:56.81]Come here, Jules.
[103:58.05]I've got a present for you.
[104:07.99]actually fell through the hole in the middle.
[104:09.35]I just hate... It's like the Wrath of Azshara is like that serpent... Eye of Azshara?
[104:15.04]No, like the boss, Wrath of Azshara.
[104:16.60]Oh.
[104:17.68]Oh.
[104:17.84]There are just some bosses in this game that they just said, fuck it, fill the room with shit.
[104:21.94]It's not even like rhyme or reason to any of it.
[104:27.24]For the most part, the boss design is great, but I don't like to fill the room with absolute nonsense bosses.
[104:34.78]They don't make very much sense.
[104:41.95]Your soul shall be mine.
[104:57.56]Woo!
[105:00.88]True shit.
[105:06.10]What is this?
[105:07.66]BFF best friends forever?
[105:09.88]Who gave me that?
[105:14.20]If you're on a different realm, yes, you can do these dungeons.
[105:17.10]As long as you are on the same faction, so you can't be a horde.
[105:41.83]Oh, you canceled it?
[105:43.03]Oh.
[105:44.37]The cloak's at 840.
[105:47.82]Oh, it's... Okay.
[105:49.26]For some reason, I thought because she had the add-on that it was... That person had the add-on and said give it to this person.
[105:54.56]Oh.
[105:54.82]Well, I'll give it to him after.
[105:56.58]Are you stupid?
[105:57.55]Hey, how about you go be sick somewhere?
[105:59.43]Fuck you.
[106:07.01]Why don't you go be... Why don't you go cough in somebody else's fucking ear?
[106:09.90]Watch your step.
[106:19.20]Why'd you go, like, hacking somebody else's brain for, like, ten more minutes?
[106:23.50]This one's not the right way.
[106:27.80]Ooh, that hurts.
[107:00.29]Too many moves.
[107:08.11]What's my longest stream?
[107:12.79]I don't know.
[107:14.29]Probably Dark Souls 3.
[107:15.71]Wow.
[107:15.91]I can give that to two people.
[107:29.86]Yeah, so when that popped up, I thought it was like, oh, doogies can trade that.
[107:32.96]I thought it meant, like, to her.
[107:34.50]Idiot, read.
[107:38.54]An eye level upgrade for these people.
[107:40.73]Sorry, I'm being rude to you.
[107:44.31]You're being a fucking obnoxious asshole, actually.
[107:47.17]I'm sorry.
[107:47.73]I need to apologize.
[107:50.33]I'm starting to become, like, star.
[107:51.53]Go chug some fucking Robitussin and go to bed.
[107:52.79]Yeah.
[108:01.01]I'll slam the bottle.
[108:05.25]For like a second, you know, just go like and then put it down.
[108:21.89]Wait, what?
[108:27.68]What happened to you?
[108:39.53]Something really fucking dumb.
[108:46.21]Nothing, you didn't see anything.
[108:52.33]I'm fine, don't worry about anything guys.
[108:58.20]This guy's dying too fast.
[109:20.57]Hey, you get a free thing, dude.
[109:22.71]Quick, quick, quick.
[109:23.27]Let me open it.
[109:27.87]He gets two things.
[109:33.85]Take it.
[109:43.46]Do I do PvP?
[109:44.10]No, I don't.
[109:46.98]Not really.
[109:47.38]Me and Boo did it like an hour the other day.
[109:53.77]It was okay.
[109:54.15]It was on the Nintendo Switch.
[109:57.21]I wish.
[110:07.21]Haste is OP for me.
[110:08.65]Well, good.
[110:18.61]Oh shit, it's Instructor Resuvius.
[110:47.78]Help.
[110:48.44]I'm getting so killed.
[110:51.84]Nothing I can do about it.
[110:52.52]That wasn't very fair.
[110:56.53]I couldn't do anything about it.
[111:00.07]It was too fast.
[111:11.38]How did that kill you that fast?
[111:13.70]I don't know.
[111:14.82]He rooted me inside the cage and then he, like, super Kamehameha'd me.
[111:20.14]And I was just rooted and getting destroyed.
[111:23.07]Alright, we're in the darkness zone.
[111:31.53]Favorite flavor of ice cream and why is it fudge brownie?
[111:35.71]Um...
[111:41.18]You know, I told you to go take some, like, Robitussin, and you gotta, like, you gotta do it.
[111:49.48]No!
[111:50.48]I couldn't get, ugh.
[111:52.00]Yeah, neither could I. I'm telling you, you just gotta go, like, take the bottle, what's the recommended dosha?
[112:00.86]Like, do, like, one, like, capful?
[112:06.40]Just go, and slam it back.
[112:09.52]Don't do that much.
[112:10.12]Don't do too much, though.
[112:11.58]You need to do, like, one dose.
[112:14.58]More than one or two doses in, like, 12 hours is not good.
[112:17.49]Don't do more than that.
[112:18.27]You better listen to me.
[112:34.88]Good, he's not immune.
[112:35.46]Thank God.
[112:49.30]favorite flavor of ice cream is probably cookie dough.
[112:53.61]I love cookie dough ice cream.
[112:54.41]It's amazing.
[112:54.97]It's like the best in the world.
[113:04.70]Or, you know, for real though, the...
[113:09.24]What the hell is it called?
[113:09.88]The Ben and Jerry's half-baked.
[113:12.80]It's big fudge pieces and cookie dough in a chocolate and vanilla swirl.
[113:17.50]It's insane.
[113:19.26]It's probably the best ice cream I've ever had.
[113:36.11]Fucking millions, millions and millions.
[113:38.47]What's up?
[113:39.99]Look at our DPS.
[113:42.07]It was both in the millions.
[113:43.51]Yeah, we both.
[113:44.05]That was very close.
[113:48.29]Why not just vanilla ice cream?
[113:49.34]I like ice cream.
[113:50.26]It's good.
[113:50.52]I don't really eat ice cream that much anymore.
[113:55.38]Not anymore.
[114:14.43]Don't taint perfection.
[114:15.88]Hey, what the hell?
[114:16.72]Who's... Hey!
[114:21.00]I'm getting comboed by the scary guy.
[114:27.45]Are you right up the road?
[114:28.39]Yeah, you are up that way, aren't you, Nordic?
[114:36.07]Do you go there and get free samples all the time?
[114:37.89]Do they do tours?
[114:39.69]They do, right?
[114:45.19]Alright, he's choking me.
[114:47.47]Stop him from choking me, please.
[115:05.17]By the way, thank you, iLawful.
[115:07.71]Thank you for the sub, welcome.
[115:12.72]I have what I was after, but I stayed just so that I could put an end to you once and for all.
[115:23.33]Oh shut up and let us play.
[115:24.95]And now you fools have fallen into my trap.
[115:29.25]Let's see how you fare, it's so weird.
[115:32.61]I will slay you all.
[115:40.96]Where did she go?
[116:08.91]I lost all my clickening stacks.
[116:10.49]That sucks.
[116:11.47]Wow.
[116:12.55]Wow.
[116:13.39]Wow.
[116:13.79]What the fuck?
[116:19.19]The ground's not as groundy as it should be.
[116:22.51]What?
[116:22.77]Is that a bug?
[116:24.23]Or they changed it to make this harder.
[116:27.57]I didn't even know that was even happening on the ground.
[116:29.82]Holy shit.
[116:30.80]Okay.
[116:34.56]That was... Alrighty.
[116:43.11]Well, I didn't see.
[116:45.73]I think there was like very faint on the ground, maybe?
[116:48.69]Very faint.
[116:49.19]I don't know.
[116:50.29]Depending on your graphic settings, you might not.
[116:55.39]Oh, damn.
[116:55.99]Okay.
[116:56.27]Well, was that what it was like a kind of a greenish color before?
[117:01.21]I don't even know.
[117:04.49]Pretty hard to spot.
[117:07.45]Huh.
[117:09.03]Well, that's good to know.
[117:13.05]Oh gosh.
[117:14.77]Oh my god, she's at us.
[117:19.22]Alright, I'm gonna get the hell away from this for a second.
[117:25.60]I'm gonna hold on to my cooldowns here.
[117:29.30]So just keep looking at the ground the whole time?
[117:30.84]Yeah, that's what I'm doing.

[118:07.93]Put a thing on top of someone, I think.
[118:12.33]That's right there.
[118:13.31]There it is.
[118:14.25]It's like blue.
[118:15.29]That is so tiny.
[118:16.20]Look at that little teeny purple.
[118:18.12]Holy shit.
[118:20.26]That is so much worse than it was before.
[118:21.78]I don't know if they did that on purpose to nerf her just to make this harder.
[118:27.86]I don't know, man.
[118:28.38]That's weird.
[118:31.58]There's also a purple thing here.
[118:33.23]Oh my god, it's right there.
[118:39.76]Was that in the notes?
[118:40.52]I don't even remember reading that.
[118:41.78]You guys are going to get hit.
[118:43.38]By the way, we need to go around.
[118:46.12]On the far right.
[118:51.18]Right here.
[118:51.56]Follow the raptor.
[118:58.71]Where did I get hit by?
[119:01.41]And hero!
[119:08.46]Where's the hero?
[119:10.70]I don't have it.
[119:11.20]Alright, pop cooldowns, go!
[119:20.89]Here it comes again.

[119:40.31]Cool.
[119:45.96]Mage asks for hero.
[119:48.64]He likes to do it.
[119:51.32]MLC Stealth likes to do it instead of me.
[119:53.41]What do I like?
[119:53.89]Doing hero.
[119:54.25]Thanks for playing, guys.
[120:07.81]I'm going to get a new group in here for the next one.

[121:56.94]We need a tank, a healer, and a DPS.
[121:58.64]Yes.
[122:03.72]We need those three, so if you haven't been, if you have been wanting to go, send me a message.
[122:12.02]Jocko on Shadowmoon.
[122:23.21]Jocko.
[122:27.65]I guess in the meantime I could... I want to do the world boss.
[122:40.15]Is there a high quality BS sound file available somewhere?
[122:42.59]I want it as my message tone.
[122:43.99]I'm sure it exists somewhere.
[122:50.15]Yeah, I did click my screen.
[122:52.31]I've become a clicker.
[123:06.67]Is there no one around?
[123:10.03]Anybody watching right now that wants to do it?
[123:11.60]If you're around, please let me know.
[123:13.36]If not, then we can... If you already went... We can fill this group here.
[123:20.56]We only have two more to do before we can be attuned.
[123:29.96]Tank 862.
[123:30.96]Now that guy... That is a tank.
[123:33.86]That is a geared up tank.
[123:34.96]What's going on, man?
[123:38.08]Thanks for coming.
[123:42.28]Why are Horde and Alliance just walking around side by side?
[123:44.44]This is a sanctuary.
[123:47.87]Is he DPS or... DPS or heals or what are ya?
[123:59.11]Then yes.
[124:01.41]Alright, just need a healer.
[124:04.73]Just need a healer.
[124:09.86]Yeah, sanctuaries are where the Horde and Alliance can both be.
[124:13.14]And they do not... They can't attack each other.
[124:18.76]It's been like this.
[124:19.42]There's been sanctuaries since Burning Crusade, I think.
[124:21.70]Wasn't Shadrath City, whatever it was called?
[124:29.73]Need a healer.
[124:31.41]And we're going to Blackrock Hold.
[124:33.03]Blackrook Hold.
[124:38.15]We'll finish...
[124:40.49]In Violet Hold, and then that should put us over the edge.
[124:45.96]Heal us with your laugh.
[124:54.16]Did it work?
[124:56.75]Yeah, Burning Crusade was the first, yeah.
[124:58.79]It's cool.
[125:01.81]You watch me from the toilet.
[125:05.75]Well.
[125:08.14]Hi.
[125:08.34]Hi.
[125:13.71]Sanctuary was the last Dalaran in Wrath, yeah.
[125:16.37]What's your eye level?
[125:20.45]854?
[125:23.87]What's yours?
[125:29.30]What's your eye level?
[125:31.58]Uh, 856, thank you.
[125:33.08]What the heck?
[125:40.05]I'm a healer, but not a filthy NA pleb.
[125:42.43]Wow.
[125:46.09]Yeah, we just need a healer.
[125:48.09]And then we can get going.
[125:52.79]Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[125:54.39]The Blood Arsar Garrus vendor.
[125:56.50]Where is he?
[126:04.34]Hello.
[126:06.48]That's Boo.
[126:07.32]I'll heal if you can't find anyone.
[126:10.24]Well, Boo, that means you're going to have to get in here.
[126:21.35]Bit too stuffy to talk.
[126:22.99]Aw.
[126:23.47]Yeah, Boo is sick.
[126:26.29]Did you do the Fellforge?
[126:28.77]Well, in that case... Yeah, Boo is sick.
[126:32.23]He can't really talk.
[126:34.97]But he can heal.
[126:35.93]I'm gonna give it like another... Like 30.
[126:41.84]Well, after I check out the vendor.
[126:43.78]If nobody has whispered me to heal, then... Um... I will take you up on that offer, Boo.
[126:52.14]Oh, is it this person over here?
[126:53.34]That's being surrounded by people?
[126:56.48]Okay.
[127:01.51]Oh my god.
[127:05.11]200 order resources for one?
[127:08.57]I kind of want to do that and just spam myself.
[127:13.57]Because I'm... I never do the world quests that give it to you.
[127:17.20]I'm pretty lazy when it comes to order resources.
[127:20.66]Dog, what are you doing?
[127:30.49]Oh my goodness.
[127:32.79]Five fell slate for one.
[127:34.71]I have like a shitload.
[127:35.59]I think I have at least like 40 or 50 on this character.
[127:39.41]Electric Man has like 100.
[127:46.78]That's cool.
[127:49.88]Go kill the world boss.
[127:53.40]We could do that while we wait.
[127:57.42]No, let's just do that.
[127:59.30]Let's go kill the world boss.
[128:04.55]We want an auto cam.
[128:07.97]There's always an auto cam.
[128:11.59]At the end of the stream.
[128:12.69]But that's not going to be for a long time.
[128:13.90]High mountain, right?
[128:19.78]Yeah, guys that are here for the dungeon.
[128:22.74]We're going to just go get the world boss real quick.
[128:26.94]What brings you here?
[128:28.18]High Mountain.
[128:29.24]Where is he in High Mountain?
[128:30.10]Good luck, friend.
[128:35.57]Frozen King.
[128:36.39]Where are you going to fly to?
[128:39.93]Stonehall for Thunder Totem.
[128:50.56]Stop.
[128:52.42]Where are you flying to?
[128:52.94]I'm watching wrestling, okay?
[128:54.56]Be careful.
[128:56.42]I'm watching what you should be watching.
[128:58.27]You need to get geared up for this Sunday, Hell in a Cell.
[129:02.79]Where you're not going to know any of the storylines.
[129:04.01]I love how fucking tuned out you are right now.
[129:06.97]Yeah, what are you saying?
[129:08.87]I'm saying, where are you flying to to do the world map?
[129:11.73]Blue to Ironhorn Enclave, which is a high mountain.
[129:17.77]I'm also about to blow my nose.
[129:20.07]I'm going to blow my nose.
[129:21.63]No!
[129:22.75]He's muted.
[129:30.65]What time is it?
[129:32.39]It's the 3 p.m.
[129:33.51]metallics.
[129:41.39]Wrestling bosses in WoW.
[129:53.56]Wasn't even that loud.
[129:54.34]Oh, it got louder progressively.
[129:56.50]He did it again.
[129:58.72]Who did what again?
[129:59.80]He went like, and then he went... Action cam might be cool for melee.
[130:16.21]You can message people across realm, but you have to add the realm that they're in, as well as the name.
[130:24.97]Who's here?
[130:25.45]Who is it?
[130:25.89]Who goes there?
[130:27.01]Hello, stream.
[130:28.65]Oh, hi, Etalyx.
[130:31.35]I just woke up.
[130:34.07]You sound like you got a raspy voice.
[130:36.67]Well, if you want to do Karazhan.
[130:39.84]Your voice has actually been getting better.
[130:44.02]If you want to do Karazhan Etalyx, there's a substantial attunement where you have to do four mythic dungeons.
[130:50.16]I did hear that there was a big deal surrounding.
[130:54.42]Is that what you guys have been doing?
[130:57.39]Yep, just bringing in random people that are watching.
[131:04.21]Did you jump off the cliff, or did you just run around?
[131:06.87]Me?
[131:07.85]to get to where you are.
[131:09.59]Did you float down or did you go all the way around?
[131:11.67]I goblin glid down.
[131:12.63]He's in a... He can actually just fly straight to Stonehoof Watch.
[131:19.27]Really?
[131:20.22]Or you can just jump off the edge like I'm going to do too.
[131:23.88]Goblin gliding down.
[131:25.54]Dead full health.
[131:26.70]Nobody's attacking him.
[131:31.38]Do you just have to do any four mythics, or do you have to do something in particular?
[131:35.56]You have to do Halls of Valor first, and then after that you have to do Black Rickhold, Vault of the Wardens, and Violet Hall.
[131:40.44]Oh, there he is.
[131:41.82]Then you order the last three, Vault of the Wardens, or Halls of Valor.
[131:48.85]Is he like a little guy, or is he just tiny on my screen as an Ant-Man?
[131:53.67]You're far above him, so look.
[131:55.95]Are you guys waiting on one more?
[131:57.15]We're waiting on a healer.
[132:00.07]Oh.
[132:02.34]No, he's at least like small.
[132:05.50]This guy's not that big.
[132:13.81]Yeah, this guy's tiny.
[132:15.33]He's like a regular enemy.
[132:23.88]Somebody aggroed him.
[132:31.17]Thank you, ChrisITA9 for your sub.
[132:34.25]Welcome, dude.
[132:43.52]Dude, there are plenty of people for you to launch off this cliff.
[132:52.54]What does the guy drop?
[132:55.88]I need to know.
[133:01.66]What have you done?
[133:03.91]What have you done?
[133:05.27]I'm not even in combat.
[133:06.23]I'm just standing underneath this, like, loincloth.
[133:11.33]I'm gonna be fine.
[133:12.91]Yeah, don't mind me.
[133:13.73]I'm just standing underneath you, Prenus.
[133:17.36]That guy just got himself killed.
[133:19.62]You tried.
[133:20.34]You tried to do the little funny thing where you got him over here.
[133:24.16]And I'm gonna be perfect.
[133:25.06]Look, I can even walk over to him now.
[133:34.20]Don't look up.
[133:39.78]Something tells me we can't do this right now.
[133:41.94]Well, there's a ton of horde over here.
[133:55.40]So Etalyx here where I'm currently just sitting at the world boss waiting for if we can't get a healer, then Boo's going to jump in and heal.
[134:03.78]That sounds good.
[134:06.22]Poor Boo.
[134:06.86]For a second, I thought that was him doing that.
[134:08.66]I thought that was the boss.
[134:11.29]It's like, well, they've reused the Headless Horseman laugh for this guy.
[134:19.55]We need to spam, like, a Get Well Boo in the chat or something.
[134:22.62]You guys are all sick, aren't you?
[134:25.84]That was just something I caught in my throat.
[134:27.68]God, I so badly want to do this.
[134:30.86]I'm just so bored right now.
[134:31.90]I just want to cause a fucking riot.
[134:34.64]Yeah, stealth is very ill.
[134:36.04]Stealth is running a fever.
[134:40.58]He's contagious.
[134:42.42]Oh, I so badly want to do it.
[134:43.46]Should I do it?
[134:43.86]What do you think?
[134:44.34]Let me just stick my head in the hornet's nest.
[134:54.39]These guys are protecting the honey.
[134:55.75]I'm a bear.
[134:56.39]I'm coming to get the honey.
[134:59.30]Where's the honey?
[135:01.18]This guy has it.
[135:03.50]Get out of my way.
[135:10.84]Somebody pulled the boss too.
[135:12.50]They no longer care about me.
[135:14.54]That's the best part about that.
[135:16.24]They don't give a shit about me anymore.
[135:18.44]They all were about to turn and start attacking me.
[135:21.64]And then they're like, ah shit, we should probably kill the boss.
[135:35.39]I'm about to add 30 days to my account for 40,000 gold.
[135:38.75]I do still need a healer.
[135:41.58]I will invite you right now.
[135:42.64]That's a lot of gold.
[135:49.36]I'm getting kind of just hit by random shit here.
[135:59.15]Good thing the Horde is here to just do this all for us, right?
[136:03.71]Right.
[136:05.25]Ready to get your free piece of gear?
[136:07.69]Right.
[136:10.35]Right.
[136:11.95]There's a Feral Druid in the back.
[136:13.63]Let's make sure he doesn't attack us.
[136:15.73]Right.
[136:17.05]Standing right behind you.
[136:17.89]I love how you're just standing in your totems.
[136:25.35]I don't want to fight him.
[136:29.10]Alright, fine.
[136:36.43]Hey, the more that you attack, the faster he'll die.
[136:38.17]I'm just gonna only chain lightning like a dick.
[136:40.80]Dude, I've done so many AoE moves right now, it's not even funny.
[136:45.62]They can't even show the numbers on the screen.
[136:46.96]Alright, yeah, I'm out of mana.
[136:51.22]That means I'm done playing.
[136:54.13]Look at all these numbers.
[136:55.51]Just like... That's so funny.
[137:01.49]I can't wait to get our free epic.
[137:07.94]Ready, watch this.
[137:08.46]Ready, watch this.
[137:09.16]Watch the people all jump in the air.
[137:11.42]Woo!
[137:11.98]Everyone went for a ride.
[137:12.98]My frame rate is kind of dying right now.
[137:24.88]I'm just chain lightning like a dick.
[137:26.52]Yeah, I am being a dick by chain lightning over and over.
[137:32.55]Where's he going?
[137:32.91]Uh oh.
[137:33.13]Where's he going?
[137:33.59]What's he doing?
[137:35.75]People are snowmen.
[137:38.46]Yeah, there's all kinds of mechanics for this fight, but, you know... Why care about mechanics when you can just spam AoE and, like, do a billion damage?
[137:54.21]Do you have a Seal of Fate token?
[137:56.55]Yeah.
[137:57.21]Because, yeah, I have one left.
[138:02.09]Alright, I'll actually... Let's fight him.
[138:03.79]I'm going to try to hurt him now.
[138:06.57]Get stunned?
[138:07.35]I don't know.
[138:09.34]I'm just only chain lightning, that's really it.
[138:12.78]Why are you so mean today?
[138:15.08]What?
[138:15.58]I mean, I'm hitting the boss.
[138:17.32]He's my primary target.
[138:19.68]I'm casting lightning bolt, but it's accidentally the one that hits other people.
[138:22.84]Oh boy, alright, good luck.
[138:25.52]Oh shit, I'm already getting attacked.
[138:28.90]Oh no.
[138:30.06]There's like a hundred fucking hordes.
[138:31.66]Where's the alliance?
[138:34.43]Oh boy, I just heard something.
[138:35.39]They're probably pissed at you for chain lightning over and over.
[138:37.97]Shit.
[138:41.27]Where's his body?
[138:42.30]Bonus loot!
[138:43.82]I didn't get anything.
[138:48.60]How did we not get credit for that?
[138:54.67]How did we not get credit for that?
[138:55.67]What?
[138:57.25]What do you mean?
[139:01.54]Oh, it said zero.
[139:02.28]Oh, never mind.
[139:12.60]Where does my Jerma sub go?
[139:13.80]What do you mean, Etalyx?
[139:14.48]What are you talking about?
[139:16.54]I'm not subscribed to you anymore.
[139:20.38]Oh, I think I had it backwards.
[139:22.10]I was going to give you my Twitch Prime and I stayed subbed to Stealth.
[139:26.26]Called it for the win.
[139:27.44]I fucking called it.
[139:30.26]Thanks a lot, Trust Purple, for the 500.
[139:31.88]Hold on, here we go.
[139:36.65]They're going to turn on me.
[139:37.59]Yeah, well, they did.
[139:38.17]It's alright.
[139:40.53]Are you doing well, boss?
[139:45.75]Alright, now let's make our way to... Boy, how am I going to get out of this?
[139:57.10]I'm going to hide in the boss's body.
[140:00.60]I'm successfully inside.
[140:01.96]There's another one now.
[140:06.23]Okay, good.
[140:06.91]It'll be distracted.
[140:07.69]Everyone will be distracted.
[140:15.10]And... success.
[140:17.02]Yo Jerma, who do you want to win this weekend between Kevin Owens and Seth Rollins?
[140:21.44]Seth Rogan.
[140:23.93]I definitely want Seth Rogan to win.
[140:34.33]Here comes his bodyguard.
[140:40.68]Okay, I want a Black Rockhold.
[140:42.80]Good old Black Rockhold.
[140:45.18]He is chasing me.
[140:51.03]Now I have to be, like, invisible.
[140:53.99]Oh, boy.
[140:54.51]I caused this.
[140:56.87]I did this.
[140:57.37]Let me just sneak over here.
[141:01.63]And... Go back.
[141:04.82]There's no way I was gonna be able to port.
[141:10.22]I had to just do that.
[141:11.08]I had to fly to Dalaran.
[141:13.14]I got that guy killed.
[141:15.29]Hey, thanks, Etalyx, for the six months.
[141:17.37]I'm back.
[141:17.67]You thought you could get rid of me.
[141:21.25]I'm back.
[141:25.18]You have my Twitch Prime now.
[141:27.02]Hey, thanks, man.
[141:28.10]But I did.
[141:30.44]No, I just clarified that.
[141:35.54]Moments ago.
[141:39.71]Yeah, those guys thought that he did that.
[141:43.06]I did an AOE move, ran away, went invisible, and that guy was the culprit.
[141:48.50]I successfully blamed the murder on somebody else, and that person got prosecuted.
[141:55.44]Well, I just sit back with a cigar in my mouth.
[142:02.67]Yeah, I need to go back to Dalaran real quick, because I want to... Do I have enough to make the... Oh my god.
[142:12.56]Stealth normally noise boy, but today is much worse than usual.
[142:17.60]Yeah, I'm so sorry that his mic is blowing out your eardrums when he does awful gross noises.
[142:24.08]I apologize for that.
[142:25.00]Stealth reminds me of a Furby, except this Furby only sneezes and coughs.
[142:34.67]What color was your guys' Tamagotchi?
[142:37.41]I believe it was green.
[142:42.78]I don't remember what color my Tamagotchi was.
[142:44.66]What kind of monster doesn't use press to talk?
[142:47.20]No, what he meant to say was what kind of monster doesn't have a key bound to mute before he blows his nose in the microphone?
[142:54.74]He doesn't even need to.
[142:55.46]He just needs to move his microphone up above his head, right?
[142:58.68]No, because then it takes like 30 seconds to put in the sweet spot to make the microphone work.
[143:04.21]30 seconds?
[143:06.63]Yeah.
[143:10.57]Alright, you go to tools.
[143:12.41]Do you have, like, butter all over your hands?
[143:15.44]No, my microphone's, like, broken.
[143:17.78]And for it to, like, work, it has to be in a sweet spot.
[143:22.48]Alright.
[143:23.12]Settings.
[143:24.62]Options.
[143:25.66]Hotkeys.
[143:27.56]Toggle microphone mute.
[143:30.08]Yeah, it's too tough.
[143:31.39]Can't do it.
[143:31.79]Use the hotkey.
[143:33.31]Fucko.
[143:34.53]Tough, sorry.
[143:34.99]Alright, let's do black rook hold.
[143:43.37]Whichever the big guy.
[143:48.62]Did this finally win a vote?
[143:51.08]No, it didn't.
[143:51.68]It never will win a vote.
[143:54.62]I'm streaming this because it's the new patch and I want to play Karazhan.
[143:59.30]And I figured I would just go all day, all night.
[144:07.56]However long it takes to get through Karazhan is how long I'm going to stream.
[144:20.08]Mafia 3 stream posted.
[144:21.76]That game's fun.
[144:22.34]I like that game.
[144:23.44]I'll be doing way more of that too.
[144:30.54]Tell me about Mafia 3.
[144:33.69]It is technically kind of all over the place.
[144:38.69]But the story is interesting enough.
[144:46.64]It's a fun kind of third-person game.
[144:51.39]Open world-ish.
[144:53.91]I've heard that after the first five hours or so, it gets really repetitive, but I don't know.
[144:57.51]I'm enjoying it so far.
[144:58.97]It's okay.
[145:02.07]I always forget what the hell this place is.
[145:06.42]Did anyone else's plugins break with the new update?
[145:10.94]I didn't know if that was normal or not.
[145:12.30]I did.
[145:12.60]I did.
[145:16.31]They're still broken.
[145:17.21]That's what I was asking.
[145:18.79]Yes, my internet is fixed, thankfully.
[145:20.53]I didn't know if they were still supposed to be broken or if I did something incorrect.
[145:26.34]Oh, I pressed Z and my game crashed.
[145:29.40]I told you.
[145:29.78]I pressed Z and my game crashed.
[145:34.55]I saw my weapons were unsheathed and I wanted to sheath them up.
[145:39.41]Game crashed.
[145:40.39]What realm am I?
[145:41.03]I am on Shadowmoon.
[145:45.66]Did I believe you at first?
[145:46.76]I was like, wow, this guy's crazy.
[145:48.50]This guy's lying to his stream.
[145:50.99]Nope.
[145:51.43]You're being serious?
[145:52.35]No, there was a guy in that dungeon that did it too.
[145:55.09]Oh, he was in on the joke?
[145:59.15]No, he just pressed it before.
[146:00.45]He said he pressed it before he actually even heard me talk about it.
[146:05.77]Press Z again.
[146:09.13]What's the wager?
[146:10.97]Should I press Z right now?
[146:13.46]That's gracious.
[146:14.95]Yeah, do not press Z. Twice in a row.
[146:28.31]Clearing the cache file will fix the Z bug.
[146:30.37]Maybe I'll do that eventually here.
[146:37.15]Eventually.
[146:43.07]Wager one Jerm a buck.
[146:55.68]What ting rate?
[146:56.38]I'd say I got 46 ting rate.
[147:05.33]What the fuck is going on here?
[147:08.97]What the hell?
[147:09.35]What is this?
[147:09.79]What is going on?
[147:10.19]What is this guy doing?
[147:14.25]What was that?
[147:14.71]Is that... The guy was like flying around in a weird mech.
[147:28.74]Alright.
[147:30.66]Let's go ahead and take care of this.
[147:34.54]Thanks for the summon.
[147:47.57]There we go.
[147:54.00]Sky Golem does that?
[148:00.19]Okay, it works.
[148:00.96]Sorry.
[148:08.52]None of this makes any sense.
[148:11.66]Only one more after this, and then I'm attuned.
[148:13.38]Alex, are you going to join us for the next one?
[148:19.38]Well, I was thinking about that.
[148:20.32]If I do, then I will be locked out of the mythic, right?
[148:23.74]Yeah.
[148:23.92]Before I get my quest.
[148:26.11]Well, I mean, you just won't get loot.
[148:27.07]I mean, you can still do it.
[148:28.41]Oh, man.
[148:30.21]This guy's all in.
[148:31.53]This guy is all in.
[148:50.72]So is this just to make sure that, like, new players... Oh, this dude is really glad.
[148:55.40]We gotta keep up!
[148:56.04]We gotta keep up!
[148:57.78]Do the old content before the...
[149:00.50]New stuff?
[149:02.92]I think they just wanted... Wow, I almost died.
[149:05.64]I think they wanted an attunement quest of sorts.
[149:09.25]I guess it makes sense if you just were to get... Hey, I think I can do mythics now.
[149:15.39]They want to make sure you can't do the hardest mythic first.
[149:19.29]I think it's, yeah, just to make sure that the... Hold on, I can't even speak right now.
[149:27.86]We pulled the whole dungeon.
[149:34.31]I got a mana.
[149:34.91]I'm gonna have to, like, evocate.
[149:52.39]Oof.
[149:55.65]Alright, what was your question?
[149:57.13]You just said?
[149:58.47]I was just trying to figure out what the... What's the plan of making us do this?
[150:01.85]Oh, it's... Yeah, it's to make sure you can do this.
[150:03.41]You know what I mean?
[150:05.20]It's to make sure you can actually complete the dungeons before you go into Karazhan.
[150:09.28]Yeah.
[150:09.76]Because Karazhan is a high level 850 something, I think.
[150:11.84]Something like that.
[150:14.72]Which is what?
[150:15.26]Like 20 higher than just the default mythic or more?
[150:19.80]Regular mythics are what?
[150:20.72]820 or 830?
[150:25.66]8.35, I think?
[150:26.86]Your Rolex were 8.10.
[150:28.10]Alright, I have no evocation and I'm 100% out of mana.
[150:46.55]I'm gonna have to drink for like a full 10 seconds.
[150:49.15]I guess that was the joke stuff.
[150:53.41]I know, I wanted to sing a song.
[150:56.72]Good song.
[150:57.46]Sing, sing, sing.
[150:58.76]As our lives change.
[151:00.76]I don't know.
[151:02.90]I don't know any more words to that.
[151:03.82]Please sing the rest of the whole song.
[151:08.11]Get your channel copywritten with my wonderful voice.
[151:12.59]My voice has never been this deep in my whole life, boys.
[151:18.61]Cheers.
[151:25.93]notifications on cooldown it's off cooldown now I can actually fight a boss cool let's get him devour the harvest has come
[151:53.66]I feed on your essence.
[151:56.60]Alright, we're the people when the people come out.
[151:58.20]Are we just going to skip it and just try to burn them?
[151:59.86]We the people.
[152:02.26]Are we the people going to just not even care that they exist?
[152:04.80]Rise and join our chorus!
[152:10.14]Yeah, obviously, who cares?
[152:11.20]We're all going to die.
[152:12.99]No, we're not.
[152:14.15]Yeah.
[152:14.91]No, we're not.
[152:20.77]Who even gets a ship?
[152:23.25]Just do a damage reduction thing.
[152:25.53]We're all dead.
[152:30.33]Oh, wow, okay.
[152:31.51]Yeah, you really blow that out of proportion.
[152:37.58]We're dead.
[152:38.16]We're all dead.
[152:39.14]We're all dead.
[152:42.28]I like this guy's comment.
[152:46.40]Zelf kind of sounds like a black guy.
[152:51.63]What did that guy say?
[152:55.12]Alright.
[152:55.42]Eye quality, comment.
[153:04.11]Lord Ravencrest.
[153:05.73]Am I excited for Rogue One?
[153:09.99]I'm getting excited for MLC Stealth to mute his mic permanently.
[153:13.81]Why?
[153:16.92]I'm looking forward to that, like, new show.
[153:18.92]I haven't been naughty.
[153:20.60]I'm looking forward to, like, Stealth turning off his microphone right now.
[153:23.53]Like, you know, that's a good TV show movie I'm looking forward to.
[153:26.59]I've been good lately.
[153:28.13]I don't deserve this.
[153:32.69]Is that coming out on DVD?
[153:44.52]to answer your question um yeah I mean I'm gonna watch it I'm gonna see it oh boy I'm gonna move out of the way I don't think it just smashed me I'm not even sure what I'm not even sure what it was
[154:19.38]This room, oh no.
[154:30.43]Sounds like you just stepped on a nail.
[154:31.63]You gotta watch out in this old black where it's called.
[154:36.15]There's all kinds of stray metals.
[154:54.52]It really stinks having to be this close.
[154:58.14]Arcane Explosion is a really fun move, but damn if it sucks having to get right in front of people.
[155:14.07]Hey Jerma, nice try on the DPS charts.
[155:18.25]I mean, you're trying your best, that's all that matters.
[155:23.09]Didn't I tell you to permanently mute your microphone?
[155:25.87]Yeah.
[155:26.67]I believe I told you to permanently, permanently mute your mic.
[155:32.50]I don't know what permanent means where you are, but permanent to me is like at least 10 seconds.
[156:05.92]When I played the game, there wasn't a limit on AoE, and it was awesome.
[156:10.10]Oh, it's just burning mana.
[156:12.26]They made it cost way more.
[156:17.97]We're going to need to jump these guys up.
[156:33.22]Is there a Jerma guild?
[156:34.18]No.
[156:34.60]I'm in like a random guild.
[156:36.16]I don't really know anybody in it.
[156:38.33]Just kind of in it.
[156:46.95]You want everyone to mute their mic just to hear Stealth cough and burp.
[156:50.86]Oh, I'm down.
[156:53.86]You might be one of like maybe four people.
[157:07.75]We're going to hear like the burp.
[157:09.09]Oh, wow.
[157:10.49]I'm getting just stunned, stunned, stunned, stunned, stunned.
[157:23.94]Oh, 20 targets.
[157:28.44]I did not even know there was a cap.
[157:34.59]Tearma, pop your cooldowns on a random rat for instant max DPS.
[157:39.49]Yeah, there's a rat.
[157:40.15]I gotta, like, make sure I save my cooldowns for the rat boss.
[157:44.33]He's coming up soon here.
[157:59.48]I wonder how long Karazhan's gonna be.
[158:06.77]Let's draw a pole for what?
[158:13.55]Pole?
[158:16.43]Yeah.
[158:18.26]Hey, iPhone charger.
[158:20.08]Thanks, iPhone-er, for your subscription.
[158:24.50]My fucking god.
[158:25.76]Hold on, I think I can help.
[158:28.85]How do you... Etalyx.
[158:29.87]You gotta help me out here.
[158:30.59]He's gonna kick me out of this Teespeak now.
[158:31.87]Can you hear me anymore?
[158:32.77]Drag him into AFK.
[158:35.65]Can you hear me anymore?
[158:37.17]I still can hear him.
[158:41.59]I can still hear him.
[158:43.17]Good.
[158:43.53]That's a massive problem.
[158:45.67]We're all friends.
[158:48.99]You want to hear your friends?
[158:52.87]There's 800 people who are not your friends.
[158:56.55]They're all my friends.
[158:58.13]I just put that in the worst possible spot too.
[159:00.13]I'm too busy being angry with you.
[159:03.75]Everybody here wants to hear me.
[159:07.05]Well, you're speaking maybe like once every five minutes.
[159:11.48]And then the other like straight silence is you burping, coughing, and making phlegm noises.
[159:16.66]So you're doing a great job.
[159:19.16]Everybody likes to see vulnerability in their heroes.
[159:21.55]It makes them more relatable.
[159:23.01]What does this do?
[159:24.25]I want to push buttons.
[159:25.39]What does this do?
[159:30.29]Apparently nothing.
[159:32.59]What does it want to do?
[159:33.85]I made you priority speaker.
[159:36.09]Priority speaker?
[159:37.27]What is it about?
[159:37.81]Like fucking Newt Gingrich?
[159:39.73]I think there's like a button you can push and it'll only your voice will come through team speaker.
[159:44.62]Are you gonna give this shit to me again?
[159:45.78]Come on now.
[159:46.18]Are you gonna give this shit to me again?
[160:01.95]Fucking fuck you.
[160:02.61]Stop giving this shit to me.
[160:03.51]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do it.
[160:11.91]HD coffer in 4K.
[160:20.64]Have I even been looting the bosses?
[160:21.84]I'm not even sure I have been.
[160:28.03]Hmm.
[160:31.01]No.
[160:33.44]No.
[160:36.68]Anybody needs these, they can have them.
[160:42.56]This is the rocks.
[160:43.69]Look out for the rocks.

[161:55.06]New sub badges?
[161:55.66]Those are coming.
[161:57.34]There's an entire channel design that's on the way.
[162:00.62]Just gonna take a couple more weeks.
[162:01.84]Maybe, yeah, we'll see.
[162:02.76]Depends on how fast he can get through it.
[162:04.07]There's gonna be new sub badges for every three months, I think it is.
[162:09.69]Whatever it is.
[162:11.41]That just went live today, too.
[162:20.20]Pipe Cleaning Robot?

[163:37.83]When we're done with this attunement.
[163:39.83]Which should be the next one.
[163:42.47]There's Violet Hold, and I think after Violet Hold, it's time to go to Karazhan.
[163:48.86]But before I go to Karazhan, I am going to grab a coffee and take a break.
[163:58.70]Please be in range.

[169:25.11]I didn't do it.
[169:27.43]But I would've.
[169:28.35]I was about to, but I couldn't because another mod did it first.
[169:31.30]Excuse me.
[169:32.60]This is the freedom chat.
[169:34.28]No.
[169:34.44]No.

[169:44.30]You know?
[169:44.94]They have the freedom.
[169:46.20]Yeah, for very certain, specific things.
[169:48.06]Everyone's free, right?
[169:49.70]Everyone's free, so the mods, therefore, are also free to use their power.
[169:55.65]Oh, no, no, no.
[169:56.73]I think I opened up a can of worms.
[169:58.37]And it will pass.

[171:48.84]Have you just now looked over?
[171:50.50]One of them is $700,000.
[171:51.26]What is going on?
[171:53.66]Why are people linking my follower count?
[172:03.70]Yeah, if you're gonna do a copypasta, you better do the Time Serpent psychology one.
[172:07.64]That's, like, the best one.
[172:11.98]This is a new copypasta.
[172:15.95]No, the Time Serpent one's the best.
[172:17.37]That's the best one.
[172:18.19]No, where is it?
[172:19.19]Where's the Time Serpent one?
[172:23.05]Hey, it's me, the Time Serpent from, like, psychology.
[172:29.71]Yeah, thanks for coming out, guys.
[172:32.03]Some clutch healing in the end there by not getting killed.
[172:44.80]What have I done?
[172:46.56]It's the time server for psychology.
[172:48.74]Here's some kind of superstar Anilander.
[172:50.72]Oh, hit me up, man.

[173:07.66]Yeah, exclusively copy-pasted now.
[173:12.16]The freedom chat.
[173:14.76]When everyone's free, no one is.
[173:17.67]Hey, you hook up with that girl, Fenestra?
[173:24.83]Reason for playing Arcane?
[173:25.87]I don't want to play Fire.
[173:28.55]I find Arcane Missiles is much more fun than...
[173:34.61]Crit spam.
[173:39.41]Okay, somebody just tried to do a shitload of ASCII art and it was just gone immediately.
[173:49.65]Did you say chat is going so fast no one will know that I like the Wii U?
[173:59.00]I like the Wii U. Oh my god.
[174:01.20]Alright, let's get a... Now everyone knows.
[174:05.69]Alright, Etalyx, we're going to get you in here.
[174:15.38]Alright, we need another... Do you actually want to play, Etalyx?
[174:23.99]I will play your last mythic.
[174:26.00]Yeah, we're doing Violet Hold.
[174:31.02]Never mind.
[174:31.64]I found something better to do with my... Something better to do?
[174:35.26]Pilot Hold sucks, man.
[174:36.94]Yeah, but you have to do it.
[174:38.10]Actually, wait a minute.
[174:38.80]No, you have to do... Yeah, you can't even do this yet to get the quest.
[174:43.30]Do I have to have the quest just to be in the group?
[174:45.90]Yeah, you have to do... You have to kill Skull Vault first.
[174:50.36]And then after Skull Vault is dead, then it opens up the three other mythics you have to do.
[174:58.76]I can't even enter the dungeon.
[175:00.48]Well, you can, but you're going to not get credit for the quest to do it.
[175:05.50]You're going to have to do it again.
[175:07.20]I know.
[175:08.42]I'll just do it anyway.
[175:11.35]Okie dokie.
[175:16.81]Unless somebody from chat would rather.
[175:20.27]Well, we need one DPS.
[175:22.03]Yes, we do require a DPS, so that would be you.
[175:25.92]Me?
[175:26.36]No, no, no, this guy.
[175:27.50]Oh.
[175:29.07]Would there be more WoW?
[175:30.45]I mean, I don't know.
[175:31.69]I'm just kind of doing it because the patch just came out and I want to see Karazhan.
[175:35.19]I figured I'd stream it.
[175:47.22]I don't get why they didn't just make it all for them in the same quest.
[175:49.68]Yeah, it's kind of weird.
[175:51.64]I don't know if it's like a lore thing.
[175:52.82]Don't ask me why.
[175:56.84]Alright, Violet Hold, it's like literally right in front of us.
[176:00.46]Oh yeah.
[176:02.62]And you're like waiting to find out where to go.
[176:04.32]And then, I believe it opens up a quest in Deadwind Pass to start Karazhan.
[176:22.00]So after I do this dungeon, in fact, I'm going to use the bathroom real quick.
[176:25.66]Actually, no, I'm not.
[176:26.42]Fuck it.
[176:27.78]I'm going to hold in my piss until we beat this.
[176:32.78]I can hold it.
[176:33.80]I'm holding in my pee.
[176:47.52]Open up the door.
[176:48.90]What?
[176:49.32]Oh.
[176:50.20]I get those later.
[176:56.97]No rewinds.
[177:02.60]Alright, get on in Violet Hole.
[177:04.58]Getting a lot of artifact power from doing these Mythics though.
[177:07.91]It's a good thing.
[177:22.58]Is that it?
[177:23.65]I think so.
[177:24.43]No.
[177:24.87]Please.
[177:25.51]Please.
[177:26.21]Please.
[177:26.93]Please.
[177:29.83]AFK.
[177:30.75]Dugas.
[177:32.13]Is Dugas AFK?
[177:33.41]I'll replace him in a second.
[177:37.71]Dugas.
[177:37.89]Dugas.
[177:38.07]Is he here?
[177:39.03]Dugas.
[177:39.23]500 bits.
[177:52.43]Alright, Dugas has about 30 seconds until I click the uninvite and we need another DPS.
[178:02.91]If I randomly die in this dungeon, it's because my primary plugin is broken and all my hotbars are messed up.
[178:09.41]Well, it's just regular mythic.
[178:12.01]It's not like a keystone or anything.
[178:13.83]Oh, yeah.
[178:14.57]That's right.
[178:16.05]Okay.
[178:17.35]Default regular mythic.
[178:18.47]I don't want to have to do this, but I think I might have to.
[178:22.90]I'm going to pee.
[178:24.65]If he's not here by the time I get back, then I've got to replace him.
[178:28.79]Rip Dugas, we'll see.
[178:29.87]I'm back.
[178:30.33]Oh, my God.
[178:30.87]He's here.
[178:31.15]Okay.
[178:31.47]Never mind.
[178:31.79]Let's go.
[178:34.26]Get on in the dungeon, buddy.
[178:35.58]You almost got kicked.
[178:37.90]Just ran into a violet.
[178:40.98]Summon me to violet ult.
[178:42.18]Is there a summoning stone there?
[178:45.61]I don't think so.
[178:49.19]So glad I didn't get ripped.
[178:50.65]Playing well with the egg.
[178:52.66]Close.
[178:56.62]I'm going to eat my mastery food.
[178:58.26]What the hell?
[179:05.31]Oh, Jerm, are you peeing on stream?
[179:13.13]Give us a beer.
[179:15.60]Beer.
[179:17.51]Are we ready to go?
[179:18.47]Oh, yeah.
[179:18.95]Oh, yeah.
[179:20.07]Oh, yeah.
[179:20.75]Alright, you in here?
[179:23.91]Alright, let's do it.
[179:26.45]Farewell.
[179:33.57]Arcane energies.
[179:42.08]Good luck to you.
[179:42.68]There's Etalyx.
[179:43.34]He's now in the dungeon with us.
[179:44.94]I am now in the dungeon.
[179:46.42]I am the demon hunter.
[179:48.16]Do it right.
[179:50.04]The new guy.
[179:51.22]I'm getting booed.
[179:52.64]You guys booing me?
[179:54.40]Wow.
[179:54.92]I'm getting booed.
[179:57.94]Do it right.
[179:59.00]Wow.
[179:59.84]Boo.
[180:00.08]Alright.
[180:02.44]I wonder how long it's going to take for them to boo me before I just grab the mic and fucking just put it right in my face and do it.
[180:11.36]Console action cam full So what does that do?
[180:26.39]Action cam f- Wow Okay, that's what it does Um, it like- That's too much for me.
[180:39.50]I gotta turn this off immediately
[180:42.24]Is it something in the options?
[180:44.20]Oh boy!
[180:45.06]This is crazy!
[180:46.00]This is like... This is ridiculous!
[180:57.57]I'm doing like less DPS than fucking... I'm the bottom.
[181:01.11]The metallics.
[181:05.38]This is so cool though.
[181:06.96]This is so cool, but does makes me want to puke for sure.
[181:10.28]What did you do?
[181:10.76]I have full action cam on Where am I going?
[181:22.50]Hide the UI.
[181:23.44]No, I have to press Z. You almost just got me.
[181:26.93]Somebody just got me to almost press Z
[181:29.64]What happens if you push Z?
[181:31.24]Don't press it.
[181:31.62]Don't do it.
[181:31.96]We're not kidding.
[181:33.32]Don't do it.
[181:33.66]Please don't do it.
[181:34.08]You're going to crash.
[181:37.01]Why does it crash your game?
[181:38.27]The whole game crashes if you press Z for some reason.
[181:41.21]Is it just like a plug-in you guys have or something?
[181:43.99]Nope.
[181:44.37]It's just they coded hard into the game that Z is going to break the game.
[181:47.67]Go to worldofwarcraft.com.
[181:48.83]It's the top post.
[181:50.84]I'm going to push it after this dungeon.
[181:52.94]I just pressed it.
[181:53.38]It crashed.
[181:54.82]I can't even.
[181:55.50]Okay.
[181:58.80]This has to go off.
[182:00.83]Let's all push Z at the same time.
[182:02.21]It'd be suicide-packed.
[182:03.71]What the hell is it called again?
[182:05.91]Console.
[182:10.20]Oh, boy.
[182:13.44]It's like The Sims.
[182:15.20]I'm back in the game now.
[182:16.88]Wait, did you actually do it?
[182:18.34]Alex, press Z. No.
[182:21.50]Do it.
[182:22.60]No, not right now.
[182:24.32]Not right now.
[182:24.92]You're going to lose aggro.
[182:31.28]But because my UI is broken, one of my moves is no longer on my hop bars.
[182:38.91]Not even on my bar.
[182:45.19]I don't have any more interrupts.
[182:46.04]I couldn't interrupt him.
[182:49.70]Couldn't do it.
[183:04.19]yeah sleep no we can use those things on the uh super elite let's use them for yeah the elite packs real beer real beer if you guys want a real beer I'm gonna have to see a beer chant in the chat
[183:32.75]Not gonna happen unless I see it.
[183:34.10]Perfect.
[183:34.68]It needs to be... Everybody in chat has to be saying it.
[183:38.88]I can tell if one person that's in the chat doesn't do it.
[183:41.95]I have a log.
[183:42.45]I can break up the logs.
[183:57.52]The room is no longer an R&I game.
[184:00.84]I'm just watching this.
[184:05.69]I've just been casting Arcane Blast and watching the chat.
[184:07.93]That was fucking funny.
[184:14.00]Chat sucks.
[184:20.80]That wasn't a beer, that was a cough.
[184:22.84]Sorry, Etalyx.
[184:23.52]I mean, not Etalyx.
[184:24.96]Sorry, I don't know why I said that was you.
[184:26.26]Your apology is accepted.
[184:28.82]Alright, fine.
[184:29.56]There it is.
[184:33.60]That was a good one.
[184:35.64]Hey, you got the low sick voice, you can do it now.
[184:54.09]It's me, the time servant.
[184:58.51]Oh no, I don't have anything to interrupt yet!
[185:00.47]I used it already!
[185:14.13]Super BR.
[185:15.19]That was the BR getting on the motorcycle.
[185:21.92]Yeah, princess marina I

[186:04.65]You gotta B.I.
[186:09.46]bite somebody.
[186:11.12]Me?
[186:12.60]Eventually.
[186:13.00]You're gonna have to B.I.
[186:13.64]somebody.
[186:13.92]I don't... What do you do?
[186:15.96]Not you.
[186:16.28]Watch out for the B.I.
[186:17.52]You're not gonna be able to attack and then you just have to bite a teammate.
[186:19.96]Watch out for the B.I.
[186:21.29]You know when it happens because you can't bite anymore.
[186:23.07]I'm gonna have to stand on this.
[186:31.53]Oh, I'm like barely paying attention.
[186:33.13]I'm too busy caring about what things in the chat are happening.
[186:36.69]What English language am I speaking?
[186:47.57]I'm too busy caring.
[186:53.73]The Bex uses R9K Beta.
[186:56.45]I don't know what that means.
[186:57.97]Come here, you.
[187:01.08]Wait what happened our healers not here anymore.
[187:06.11]We don't have anything else.
[187:08.35]Oh, we don't have a healer Did he hit Z did he press Z?
[187:12.95]Might have pressed Z. Well I can live through this boss, but that's it.
[187:16.97]Oh, no.
[187:23.39]Alright, let's find a healer.
[187:25.43]What do you guys say?
[187:26.91]We could just leave now.
[187:29.75]That's all we needed to do.
[187:31.74]Really?
[187:32.06]Although I don't really want to lock out these people from this mythic.
[187:38.56]But we definitely need a healer to continue.
[187:46.12]We could just leave now.
[187:47.01]This is for Z for D for voice.
[187:49.25]We need a healer and there's no way to pause this dungeon.
[187:51.75]Yeah.
[187:53.29]actually yeah can we even walk out of the door quick run get out leave while you still can open the doors let us out of here let us out of here fucking legions attacking sorry we thought we could handle it we can't handle it open the fucking door invite he's here oh my god why is he out of the party
[188:23.07]I don't know, there he is, the coconut.
[188:24.89]How did he get kicked from the party?
[188:26.31]Uh, the coconuts.
[188:32.93]Well, I don't know why I did that.
[188:35.35]It just had to happen.
[188:37.63]I could come back, uh... Well, thank you for potentially subbing in.
[188:42.49]My whole server crashed.
[188:43.27]Hopefully you didn't press Z. That helps me so much.
[188:52.34]It's really, really just grinding on my patience right now.
[188:58.41]Something about that is like seriously like just sticking a wrench into my bicycle spur.
[189:03.98]What's it called?
[189:04.62]What's it spokes?
[189:06.16]Well, like the first few times it's like normal, but here's the thing.
[189:09.80]Stealth makes noises usually, but now that he's sick, it's like we're getting it to a, it's a 10 instead of like a 5 now.
[189:19.08]I told him to go, like, slam some fucking, uh, some Robitussin.
[189:24.84]We're used to this standard quantity of noises.
[189:28.44]This is like the deluxe package.
[189:30.94]Daleks, you need to un-give Jerma talking.
[189:33.48]By the way, um, MLC Stell, it'd be really great if you were actually doing this.
[189:37.74]I'm in the dungeon now.
[189:38.72]I left it when our healer left.
[189:41.02]I didn't want to die.
[189:42.80]I'll walk back in.
[189:43.94]Uh, attack the Jerma.
[189:45.06]Talk at the same time real quick.
[189:46.94]What?
[189:48.07]Hey.
[189:48.25]Talk at the same time.
[189:50.75]Jerma, priority speaker.
[189:52.35]Why, what?
[189:53.15]Okay, there you go.
[189:54.73]You're fine.
[189:55.63]But before, Etalyx, like, muted when Jerma was talking.
[189:59.80]Oh, yeah.
[190:00.04]I don't want to fight these guys.
[190:02.98]What I said was, it's like we got the stealth noise deluxe package.
[190:06.42]Normally, it's just the standard package.
[190:08.28]But when he's sick, it's the deluxe edition.
[190:12.68]Listen, if you can't accept me at my worst, I'll pay your thirst.
[190:16.95]I don't think I can accept you.
[190:19.28]Look at another Legion squad.
[190:21.86]They don't exist anymore.
[190:25.40]Wow, look at my DPS.
[190:26.18]Anyone else on there?
[190:28.24]Yeah, you missed it, Etalyx.
[190:29.62]He was like, oh, look at these logs.
[190:31.20]Look at how much better you should be doing.
[190:32.70]Look at how you suck.
[190:33.72]I mean, I'm doing very good.
[190:34.82]You need to check the logs.
[190:39.47]I look like Jerm was on top of that fight.
[190:41.25]I was.
[190:43.11]What fight?
[190:43.65]The one we just did where I was on top?
[190:45.45]The boss!
[190:45.85]No, Jocko was on top for this last fight.
[190:48.75]That was at the very bottom of that last fight.
[190:51.09]Yeah, check total.
[190:51.64]I've done double the damage Jerma has this raid.
[190:55.06]Dungeon.
[190:56.72]Yeah, right one.
[190:57.86]Go, go, like, go, go, go print screen a log for me.
[191:02.09]Hey, go print, go 3D print a log out of your ass.
[191:33.20]3D print some DPS.
[191:36.14]Just turn on your 3D printer.
[191:39.66]Okay, we started a dialog and I thought we were done.
[191:53.76]Last time.
[191:58.93]I bet I don't read chat.
[192:00.83]I'm reading the whole damn thing, man.
[192:04.76]The whole thing, from start to finish, like a good book.
[192:11.32]I'm missing one of my abilities.
[192:13.03]Was it removed in this patch?
[192:15.55]Or did they reset my talents?
[192:20.23]Not sure.
[192:22.47]They did a lot of changes.
[192:23.56]Did you read the patch notes?
[192:25.78]No.
[192:28.42]Did not didn't read the patch notes Wow my games never changed even hunter They haven't changed even under since the first patch after leaves From a presidency see what happens I almost just did Come not I know you're not I almost just pressed it We're gonna kill these bugs what do you want just no no scope it let's go from one just no scope this I
[192:58.31]Shit, a beetle's on me.
[192:58.94]You're gonna have to help me fucking no-scope this guy.
[193:05.36]Can't taunt him.
[193:06.72]Well, I guess we're just no-scoping this.
[193:11.64]Well, it hurts.
[193:12.77]It's very painful.
[193:16.99]And Jocko is almost dead.
[193:19.15]Why didn't that go off?
[193:19.99]It should've.
[193:21.71]He's got four million health.
[193:24.78]He does.
[193:25.76]And not have very much health.
[193:32.44]Just rip off the Z key.
[193:35.50]Press Z now.
[193:36.66]Those are actually an upgrade for me.
[193:38.84]Alex, we were pranking you the whole time.
[193:44.00]I can't believe you haven't pressed Z yet.
[193:45.74]It doesn't actually crash again.
[193:47.12]Why couldn't these have rolled up to 850?
[193:48.76]I would have put them on.
[193:49.82]No, I just pushed Z. It doesn't crash my game.
[193:51.82]Hold.
[193:51.96]You have to hold B. Walk in a straight line and press Z. Uh-huh.
[193:56.73]I was doing the same thing.
[193:57.53]I was like, if he doesn't crash my game, I was pressing it over and over, and then now every time I press it, it crashes.
[194:01.59]So it'll get to you.
[194:02.47]Don't worry.
[194:03.81]Dog game.
[194:04.21]I don't believe you.
[194:07.69]Definitely happens to you.
[194:08.49]You'll see it soon enough.
[194:10.50]Sooner or later, life finds a way.
[194:14.64]Hi, Mariah.
[194:23.98]Disclaim your solid gold bar.
[194:32.86]Etalyx, get that guy.
[194:34.02]Thank you.
[194:34.50]He's on me.
[194:35.18]He didn't even touch anyone else.
[194:36.28]He was running at me, and it was wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked scary.
[194:41.24]Etalyx, come on.
[194:42.80]Get that guy.
[194:43.54]Etalyx, it was wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked scary.
[194:47.16]Wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked scary.
[194:51.99]Oh, I got him.
[194:54.53]Don't worry.
[194:54.83]I'll hold you.
[195:04.06]Why did I just get this thing pop up on my screen?
[195:07.14]Did you guys get that too?
[195:07.84]Assault on Violet Hold.
[195:10.49]What?
[195:11.33]They just wanted to make sure we knew what we were doing.
[195:13.15]Wait, wait, wait.
[195:14.77]Is that a world quest that just appeared right now on us?
[195:18.33]No, there's no world quest for Violet Hold, is there?
[195:21.03]I have no idea.
[195:22.19]What the heck?
[195:27.98]Is this a boss?
[195:29.92]No, it's just a regular guy.
[195:31.70]It's just a regular shitty enemy.
[195:35.31]My UI is broken and I can't see what percentage we are through to the next boss.
[195:40.52]Zero.
[195:41.64]Wait, what?
[195:42.00]Zero?
[195:42.70]That's not possible.
[195:43.82]I know.
[195:44.16]We've done like two or three waves.
[195:45.76]That's what I'm saying.
[195:46.70]I think that something just screwed up.
[195:48.84]Game broke.
[195:49.62]Game sucks.
[195:51.46]Get me out of this.
[195:52.70]No.

[198:34.06]What?
[198:34.58]You have to do all the damage.
[198:35.68]I'm about to die.
[198:40.14]I just died.

[199:05.41]Oh my god, I forgot.
[199:06.25]I think you're right.
[199:06.79]I have to pee really badly.
[199:10.13]I forgot.
[199:12.05]I completely forgot how bad I had to go to the bathroom there.
[199:22.91]I forgot about that move.
[199:35.09]I forgot about that move.
[199:38.85]Oh, come on.
[199:39.53]Really?
[199:39.85]Oh, it's me.

[200:22.80]Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice!
[200:27.34]He's doing it to me.
[200:28.00]That's pointing right at me.
[200:30.72]He got a double kill.
[200:33.40]What?
[200:33.72]He just fucking killed me.
[200:37.28]He just triple killed me.
[200:40.83]Wow, only one million health and Jerma dies.
[200:43.01]Come on, Jerma.
[200:44.21]He comboed me.
[200:44.93]He did like a triple kill.
[200:45.65]Yeah, I died too, but I reincarnated.
[200:52.21]I got another piece of loot.
[200:53.63]Look at me.
[200:54.61]Holy freaking cow.
[200:57.35]All I'm getting today are cloaks, rings, and fingers.
[201:01.25]Or fingers and necklaces.
[201:04.65]Those are the last things on the planet.
[201:08.21]It's showtime.
[201:12.45]Let's go turn in our complete four mythic dungeons.
[201:14.57]And Karazhan is going to put us on the trip to Karazhan.
[201:17.57]Then I'm going to go to Dunkin' Donuts.
[201:23.24]But thanks for playing, guys.
[201:26.55]Until next time.
[201:27.55]Tell them what they've won.
[201:29.33]Whatever they got from the dungeon.
[201:31.81]Thanks for playing.
[201:33.07]So, Etalyx, you need... You're not ready for Karazhan.
[201:36.79]Correct.
[201:38.05]You are not prepared for Karazhan.
[201:40.15]I am not prepared.
[201:41.92]Prepare yourself while Gemma goes to get Dunkin' Donuts.
[201:44.78]Okay, can you do five dungeons?
[201:46.42]Yeah, can I do... This has been about three and a half hours.
[201:52.11]Ooh, what's in the box?
[201:55.67]Alright, give me something good.
[201:59.29]Ooh, I got some pretty good loot.
[202:01.05]Did you?
[202:02.37]Yeah, from turning in that cash, I got 875 shoulders.
[202:06.61]Whoa.
[202:07.95]Whoa!
[202:10.89]Is this the thing?
[202:11.55]Is this the thing?
[202:13.13]This is the thing!
[202:13.63]Oh my god, this is the thing!
[202:16.38]I think this is the fucking really, really good trinket.
[202:20.16]Is it wriggling sinew?
[202:25.91]I think this is the one that everybody wants.
[202:28.39]865.
[202:35.30]Gained 10 stacks of Manding Whispers.
[202:42.90]That thing is... Yeah, this is the thing.
[202:44.54]Boo told me this is the thing.
[202:47.06]Boo, where's Boo?
[202:52.35]Wait.
[202:54.49]I don't understand.
[202:56.55]So why is this so great?
[202:57.85]Why is this like the greatest thing ever?
[202:59.08]Alright, well look how much damage it does, right?
[203:02.46]You get 10 stacks of a thing.
[203:05.66]Each stack deals 60,000 damage.
[203:09.24]So each time you do a move, it applies one stack.
[203:14.45]So it's just like a move that does 600,000 damage.
[203:19.29]Fuck.
[203:21.17]For free.
[203:22.39]What's the cooldown?
[203:25.58]Okay, so I don't know what to do here.
[203:27.34]Two minutes.
[203:28.12]Two minute cooldown.
[203:29.12]Both my trinkets are really good.
[203:35.02]This is the thing.
[203:36.28]It's another used trinket, though.
[203:39.00]Horn of Valor 860 is great, though.
[203:42.80]3200 intellect for 30 seconds?
[203:50.07]Let's just put it on.
[203:56.62]It's basically like two and a half of my most damaging move.
[204:03.53]Jesus.
[204:04.61]I think that's why.
[204:05.61]Ten stacks of a thing.
[204:08.49]But Horn of Valor is so good.
[204:11.47]Like, what's your most damaging move?
[204:13.43]And how much damage does it do?
[204:14.95]Arcane Blast.
[204:17.13]Does like 800,000, 880 on a crit.
[204:17.83]Eye of Sculpey?
[204:18.67]No, Eye of Sculpey is good.
[204:25.48]Mastery and Crit are my two most necessary stats.
[204:29.42]But look at what Eye of Skoalval does.
[204:32.96]It does damage.
[204:37.56]Let's go to total.
[204:40.21]Total damage.
[204:44.81]This Fel Meteor procs all the time.
[204:49.31]It did 6% of all the damage I did in that whole dungeon.
[204:53.82]I like that's really good it doesn't have a cool down it makes up six percent of all of my damage is this all you have to do is just keep all of them and just replace one and try it in a dungeon see how much DPS you do not like a permanent decision one way or another go to Dunkin Donuts and piss on the counter you may not be back after that unfortunately
[205:23.78]If I go pee on the Dunkin' Donuts counter, I'm pretty sure I'm going straight to prison.
[205:32.80]Alright.
[205:33.48]I'm going to... I'm legit going to go get a coffee.
[205:38.66]I'm going to keep the stream on.
[205:40.72]Really?
[205:41.68]Oh, yeah.
[205:42.24]I'm going, dude.
[205:42.78]I'm going all day.
[205:43.50]You better mute yourself.
[205:48.34]I'm going to keep... No, I'm keeping my mic unmuted.
[205:50.26]What if somebody breaks into my house?
[205:52.05]No, I mean, you better keep your speakers muted.
[205:56.43]Are you actually going to BRB to Dunkin' Donuts while the stream's still on?
[205:59.43]I'm just going to go like... I'm going to be back in like five minutes.
[206:01.49]I'm just going to like screw down the street.
[206:02.89]I'm going to be like... Turn your phone on and turn the stream on there.
[206:08.76]They can't do that.
[206:11.32]it's gonna be like rip the fucking wheel like why arcane over fire because I find arcane more interesting I like the spells in arcane alright I'm specifically arcane missiles is like my favorite move in the game do a periscope to Dunkin Donuts like no dude that's like illegal

[206:45.48]Isn't that, like, against the law?
[206:46.46]No, get, like, a phone mount.
[206:48.79]You want me to go to, like, Best Buy and get a phone mount?
[206:50.65]I'll be back in, like, two hours.
[206:51.83]No, you should have a, everyone should have a phone mount in their car.
[206:56.57]Put it in the cup holder and point it up towards your chin.
[206:58.99]Alright, turn on auto run and just see where I end up.
[207:00.89]Okay, fine.
[207:04.86]I'll do that.
[207:05.82]Grim, what's your ETA?
[207:06.44]When are you going to be back?
[207:07.82]I'm literally going right now to pee, go in my car, go to Dunkin' Donuts, and come right back.
[207:13.10]And I'm going to go to, like... I don't know.
[207:18.03]Where should I go and just walk?
[207:19.41]I need to go poop extremely badly.
[207:21.41]It might be a bad one.
[207:23.11]I might have to shower afterwards, so I'm not sure how long it's going to take me.
[207:25.41]Oh my god!
[207:25.73]So I need to gauge how long you're going to be gone for.
[207:27.45]You have to take a shower after you go to the bathroom?
[207:29.93]Well, I'm sick right now, you know?
[207:30.87]It's going to be so messy.
[207:32.19]Are you going into your hands?
[207:34.37]Or are you going, like, into a toilet?
[207:36.39]I don't have a toilet big enough.
[207:38.01]What, are you in, like, a baby toilet?
[207:40.51]I'm sick.
[207:40.87]I'm ill.
[207:42.35]He's going to poop in the shower, is what he's trying to say.
[207:44.62]Oh, god.
[207:45.48]Okay.
[207:47.24]Go get your donuts.
[207:49.32]Alright, I'm going to get my Dunkin' Donuts.
[207:52.70]I've been live for three and a half hours.
[207:54.28]I'm going to be live for probably another four.
[207:56.63]So you're going to have to give me a minute.
[207:59.79]Getting some tea.
[208:01.11]I am going to leave.
[208:02.53]So thanks for playing.
[208:03.57]You're leaving permanently?
[208:05.33]Well, what else am I going to do?
[208:06.69]I need to go to work.
[208:08.33]Oh, wait.
[208:09.23]Where's Boo?
[208:09.87]Is Boo around?
[208:12.13]Who can be around to sit here and talk a bunch of shit while I'm gone for five minutes?
[208:16.92]He doesn't want to talk.
[208:20.75]I'm going to the restroom.
[208:22.72]I'll see you in a minute.
[208:24.96]Bye, everyone.
[208:26.18]Put on auto-cam while you're gone.
[208:29.04]Auto?
[208:30.50]I promise you I will auto-run somewhere randomly and just see what happens.
[208:35.26]Let's just go to the Vale of Eternity.
[208:36.44]Let's go to Pandaria.
[208:37.40]I need a place with an open field.
[208:49.50]Boo isn't, yeah, Boo's not on the call.
[208:51.32]Play one of your YouTube videos while you're gone?
[208:57.23]Play one of your stream videos and then it'll be like you're streaming.
[209:04.05]Let me just turn this in first and see, like, what the next step is.
[209:07.61]Anyway, catch you guys later.
[209:09.29]See you soon.
[209:13.41]Is Boo, alright, Boo, did Boo, Boo, Boo, Boo?
[209:17.24]Boo, did you do any of these attunement quests?
[209:19.83]Or am I going in with viewers into Karazhan?
[209:30.52]Private Jerma rumble screening?
[209:32.22]I'm not going to be gone for 40 minutes.
[209:36.96]That's so much artifact power.
[209:42.78]I won.
[209:43.18]Alright.
[209:44.70]Order of Uncertainty.
[209:45.78]Help Khadgar unravel the mystery behind the fragments.
[209:48.99]Okay.
[209:49.87]Let us begin.
[209:51.25]Here we go.
[209:51.99]It's going to teleport me into Karazhan and the music's going to play.
[209:55.49]Gul'dan and Legion must be stopped.
[210:22.37]Ooh, look at that crystal.
[210:26.33]Put a picture of my face up while I'm gone.
[210:29.89]No.
[210:31.15]I was so distracted by our efforts on the Broken Isles that I neglected the defenses I put in place.
[210:37.16]You can hear him teeing.
[210:39.56]The Legion has taken Karazhan.
[210:42.10]We must get it back.
[210:45.01]Oh yeah, the mystery has been unraveled.
[210:47.61]Let's go get Karazhan.
[210:48.57]There is much to be done.
[210:51.43]Time has come
[210:53.88]Meet Khadgar outside of Karazhan.
[210:55.80]Put cookie clicker on?
[210:59.44]Let me just get this out of the way.
[211:01.49]And then I'm gonna go dunk and pee.
[211:03.51]I'm taking this off for now.
[211:21.15]You're going to leave or what?
[211:22.03]Stop.
[211:22.29]Yeah, I'm going to.
[211:23.05]I'm just waiting.
[211:23.57]I just want to get this preliminary shit out of the way.
[211:26.69]So then when I come back, it's just like right into Karazhan.
[211:29.24]Let's get it done.
[211:37.68]Play a video of Paul Bearer.
[211:51.35]The plans for when I'm gone are gonna be longer for when I actually am gone.
[211:54.84]That's probably true.
[211:59.34]Oh, boy.
[211:59.80]There's gonna be so many people.
[212:00.90]Look at all these dead bodies and shit and all these... It's gonna be a nightmare.
[212:05.55]People are just... Oh, yeah.
[212:07.25]Hey, champion!
[212:08.59]Come down to Karazhan so I can... Oh, wait a minute.
[212:11.55]There's a fucking bloodbath out here.
[212:14.58]We must stop the Legion.
[212:17.24]Whoa.
[212:19.00]Oh, by the way, can you hear me over all these people doing all their fucking cooldowns?
[212:23.46]So, the Legion is inside of this door.
[212:27.40]It will take us lots of time and effort, but by the time we're done here, champion, we will have Gul'dan.
[212:34.41]Did I mention Gul'dan?
[212:35.57]Alright, I'll be back.
[212:42.07]I'll fucking... Investigate Karazhan!
[212:50.45]Aren't you people supposed to be investigating Karazhan?
[212:55.21]What the fuck is this?
[212:56.33]What was that?
[213:03.55]Oh, I thought he was huge.
[213:05.83]I thought this guy was enormous.
[213:12.06]This is never going to stop.
[213:13.34]I'm never going to be able to talk to Khadgar.
[213:15.16]He's in here.
[213:15.84]Look at him.
[213:16.74]We have to find Khadgar.
[213:17.80]Look, there he is.
[213:19.24]He's just like, oh, shit.
[213:29.53]Whoa.
[213:31.11]I did not expect this.
[213:33.33]I thought we were going to come here to do some investigation.
[213:36.15]But no, it looks like you're all going to fucking kill each other.
[213:39.84]Whoa.
[213:40.32]Whoa.
[213:43.92]God.
[213:44.26]Alright.
[213:49.57]I'm gonna be right back.
[213:54.25]Getting some tea.
[213:55.05]One second.
[213:57.49]I shall return.
[213:59.51]Go do what you gotta do.
[214:00.55]Go pee.
[214:01.41]Go get a snack.
[214:04.03]I will see you guys in like... I'm gonna update this.
[214:09.72]Instead of saying one second, it's gonna say
[214:25.68]That doesn't even show up.
[214:29.32]Alright.
[214:29.82]Getting some tea.
[214:30.78]Five minutes.
[214:31.44]Five mim.
[214:33.98]Five mim.
[214:38.26]Alright.
[214:38.63]I'll be back.
[214:40.39]Stay cool while I'm gone.
[214:41.99]I'll see you guys in a few minutes.
[229:06.29]Hello?
[229:09.39]Thought I just heard a noise.
[229:11.66]Hi.
[229:13.14]Hey, so I forgot that you were streaming, so I was kind of, like, snorting.
[229:18.76]Oh my god.
[229:20.12]With my headset on.
[229:21.13]How did you forget that I was streaming?
[229:23.95]Well, I thought you'd be smart enough to, like, mute me.
[229:26.85]No, I said somebody, like, tell a story.
[229:29.33]I said, like, talk while I'm gone.
[229:30.65]I said, who's going to be, like, here to talk?
[229:33.23]And you said you were leaving.
[229:34.25]I was snorting while you were gone.
[229:36.45]Oh, my God.
[229:37.13]Hopefully you didn't, like, shit your pants or something.
[229:42.43]I just looked over at your stream and it said, stealth, please.
[229:45.83]And then I saw snorts.
[229:48.23]The chat.
[229:48.87]So I was like, uh-oh.
[229:51.31]Do you not remember me saying that, like, somebody sniggered?
[229:54.35]No, I was already gone.
[229:56.15]Well, that should give a fucking leaving randomly without saying you were leaving.
[230:07.10]Alright.
[230:09.28]What the hell is that doing?
[230:11.96]How are your donuts?
[230:14.21]They're good.
[230:14.49]They're good.
[230:16.09]Nobody asked me.
[230:16.87]He knew.
[230:17.67]He knew.
[230:18.19]Alright.
[230:21.41]I'm going to change my stream title.
[230:27.87]You're dead, by the way.

[230:36.15]Hold on.
[230:42.47]I still need to talk to Khadgar and say okay, yeah.
[230:53.40]Yeah, I got a good stream title now.
[231:00.48]Refresh just to see the new stream title.
[231:19.12]so the question at hand here is number one is boo watching the stream and number two did he do his attunement uh dungeons because he expressed interest to do this I wonder if he did he's on a high mountain right now I wonder let me just let me just whisper boo
[231:40.68]Did you do attunement to Kara?
[231:48.92]Why can't... Oh shit, I forgot I turned off all these things.
[232:00.10]No, not even one.
[232:01.10]Oh shit.
[232:02.84]Well... It's time to do a party in Karazhan!
[232:07.90]You got a fucking, Boo got a legendary on his warlock.
[232:10.38]Another one.
[232:10.74]When?
[232:11.70]Like, apparently, like, right now.
[232:13.06]Well, like, within the last, uh, like, few minutes.
[232:16.70]Oh, good one.
[232:20.24]He did.
[232:20.56]Well, he did.
[232:21.74]Wow.
[232:22.84]Congratulations, Boo.
[232:23.88]Who's the first person to get two legendaries in the game?
[232:28.23]In World of Warcraft.
[232:31.71]Your instant cast spells have a chance to make your next non-instant cast spell cast a spell while I'm moving.
[232:41.00]That's the legendary you got.
[232:42.90]Well, is that a second or a third?
[232:47.50]Second, I think.
[233:01.61]I'm in Karazhan.
[233:02.75]Where's the quest giver?
[233:05.93]How do we talk to this person without dying?
[233:08.49]That's gonna be the... See, the real thing about Karazhan is gonna be how to do the attunement quest without being killed.
[233:16.74]Okay, I'll do that.
[233:17.34]It's gonna be fun.
[233:18.50]Oh, no.
[233:19.12]There's one more quest I gotta... Okay, I accepted all three quests.
[233:25.76]What do they want us to do?
[233:27.73]Wait, there's more quests to do here?
[233:30.10]Three quests that we gotta pick up.
[233:31.58]Oh, shit.
[233:32.96]Or you gotta turn in the quests underneath us.
[233:34.22]What are you... What?
[233:36.12]No, I mean, but, like, this... It's not just like, hey, you made it.
[233:39.43]Go into Karazhan now.
[233:40.33]We actually have to do, like, three different things here.
[233:43.85]How?
[233:44.83]How is that possible?
[233:45.73]I don't know.
[233:47.39]Look at all the people around here.
[233:50.13]How are we gonna be able to do that?
[233:51.41]We have to do quests here?
[233:55.33]How does Blizzard still not understand...
[233:58.42]I don't think I can even rez here.
[234:04.66]Alright, here we go.
[234:05.42]We're at Khadgar.
[234:06.99]Can I, uh... I can't even right click him.
[234:12.05]You can complete the quest.
[234:12.91]I can share the quest.
[234:13.77]Alright, I got them both.
[234:16.67]There's no more?
[234:17.31]Yeah.
[234:17.47]Okay, run.
[234:21.67]Now how do we do this?
[234:22.35]Do we have to go underground?
[234:23.35]There's like little... There's staircases here.
[234:26.41]Um... I guess we go underground.
[234:28.30]Do we have to talk to this person?
[234:30.08]No.
[234:31.28]Are you dying?
[234:31.66]Look at this!
[234:32.50]Look at this mess!
[234:33.30]Are you dying?
[234:35.68]No, I'm good.
[234:36.32]I made it down.
[234:36.72]Are the bad guys down there?
[234:39.63]I think we have to be down here, yeah.
[234:40.87]There's like a guy we have to... Kill 20 legions and... Grab some stuff if you need it.
[234:47.17]What of?
[234:47.85]Ah.
[234:47.99]Ah.
[234:48.37]You getting attacked?
[234:50.19]No.
[234:50.83]I'm scared.
[234:53.16]Ah.
[234:54.80]Being attacked?
[234:56.38]What the hell is this new thing?
[234:57.10]Alright, I think we have to... How are we going to get 20 things killed here?
[235:00.63]This is going to be difficult.
[235:04.37]Toop D. Swiggins the Third.
[235:07.03]Thanks for the subscription, dude.
[235:08.13]Welcome.
[235:08.39]I just keep walking by dead bodies.
[235:14.91]There's so many horde here, it's going to be impossible for us to tag one enemy.
[235:20.96]There's also a quest down here, too.
[235:23.70]You got somebody.
[235:24.24]Thanks, people.
[235:31.22]Well, at least I updated the title to say this was a burp and booger stream.
[235:36.71]Good luck.
[235:38.19]Jesus.
[235:43.17]Wait, what?
[235:45.17]Oh, there's a thing over here.
[235:46.56]I haven't eaten all day, and I have a fancy plate, and I fancy a plate of chips.
[235:51.84]I hope you get what you most desire.
[235:55.28]I'm kind of, like, just dying.
[235:56.36]Did you get this thing that I destroyed?
[235:58.52]Yeah, I think I did.
[236:00.84]I hope I did.
[236:01.94]This is such a mess.
[236:09.42]Do we have to loot anything from these guys, or do we just have to kill them?
[236:12.37]There's a quest over here, also.
[236:13.59]I think we just have to kill them.
[236:23.18]Oh, what's this?
[236:26.22]Just gonna bring it back.
[236:30.41]I collect a sample of this water.
[236:36.05]I heard somebody die.
[236:36.97]Collect a sample of water, Jerma.
[236:40.67]I just didn't.
[236:41.09]It didn't do anything.
[236:43.87]In this lake here?
[236:45.59]Yeah.
[236:51.01]Doesn't seem to be doing anything.
[236:53.70]Do it better.
[237:03.37]What is this?
[237:09.90]My immersion is just broken here.
[237:12.92]It's like, oh, let's take a look at what's happening under the caves of Karazhan.
[237:20.25]I already have this one?
[237:21.33]Oh, that's okay.
[237:22.23]You need two of them.
[237:23.53]Alright, let's go inside this green evil looking thing.
[237:27.01]Inside the green evil thing.
[237:32.15]Do we want to do that?
[237:33.23]I don't think we can even get in there.
[237:38.42]Okay, everyone else is going in.
[237:39.48]We're not allowed to yet.
[237:40.82]Apparently not yet.
[237:42.86]Essence of soil?
[237:43.70]Where the hell is that?
[237:45.76]We need to go get the eastern key.
[237:46.94]I don't know where that is.
[237:49.36]We got the western one.
[237:52.14]What is a... Oh, it's probably just down the other... The other side?
[237:56.24]I just get so confused when this shit happens, because it's just like, there's just hundreds of fucking people all running around in circles.
[238:03.72]It's just like... Yeah, let's go get these guys.
[238:06.60]Hold on, I still need to kill things.
[238:16.45]Just being a tagger.
[238:19.22]Just being a tagger.
[238:20.62]Tagging things and running away.
[238:22.70]Hoping somebody else gets the kills.
[238:28.58]Eventually someone will get it.
[238:31.01]I need to.
[238:32.05]My lord.
[238:32.61]I need to untrack like half these quests.
[238:36.91]These are just like annoying.
[238:44.92]I just need to go down the other.
[238:47.32]Farewell.
[238:54.45]There we go, now I can see.
[239:04.57]Speak to Khadgar?
[239:08.52]No, I see what you mean.
[239:10.42]In the other cellar.
[239:14.86]MLC snort.
[239:17.40]You're getting a lot of attention in this chat here.
[239:21.00]Thank you.
[239:21.50]Everyone's like, wow.
[239:23.72]Look at this guy.
[239:24.34]I really like this guy that's snorting.
[239:31.94]I'm glad I have Boo here to tell me how to play the game even when he's not here in the call.
[239:37.01]What's he doing?
[239:38.61]He just told me that I can easily shift left click something.
[239:43.43]Left click.
[239:47.98]Boo, is your legendary any good?
[239:49.43]Boo, how come you're not here with us?
[239:50.77]We're trying to experience Karazhan together as friends.
[239:53.83]Boo, is your legendary any good?
[239:57.53]Status of the internet issue?
[239:58.45]I think I missed the news.
[239:59.17]Well, thanks, Hypo, first of all, for nine months.
[240:02.27]And thanks to Radio Vidya, also, for four months.
[240:04.93]Oh, we need to go get the soil up here.
[240:06.49]This corrupted soil.
[240:07.73]Yeah.
[240:09.30]But, Hypo, the status is it has been fixed.
[240:11.98]The issue is gone.
[240:12.80]It has been resolved.
[240:14.22]The ticket has been closed.
[240:17.54]Hopefully that is that's what I've been told at least that the problem is completely gone I'm gonna cross my fingers that I wasn't lied to Not necessarily lied to but that it was actually fixed and the guy that made the issue completely closed at the plant actually got it right Oh
[240:40.36]Hell yeah.
[240:41.28]Boo, you didn't do your intubates.
[240:43.04]You're legendary.
[240:43.90]I came back to my computer just as you guys got into Halls of Valor at the start.
[240:48.30]I thought, fuck me, I just missed everything.
[240:50.36]Oh, we could have got you in the next one, so you could have gotten... It's no big deal.
[240:54.55]Is that right?
[240:55.63]How's that legendary?
[240:56.25]I haven't actually tried it yet.
[240:58.17]I'm just doing the dailies on another tune.
[241:01.37]Hey, Boo.
[241:01.91]All it does is make you sometimes be able to cancel a movie.
[241:04.45]Where'd you get it from?
[241:07.01]Warden's Emissary.
[241:09.52]We were just saying earlier, we haven't seen one from Emissary Chess.
[241:14.84]And there's one.
[241:15.84]I haven't tried yet.
[241:18.78]I think it's going to be alright because everything on Demonology is you have to stand still and cast.
[241:27.35]So I think it could be alright.
[241:29.13]What's the best in slot legendary?
[241:35.02]The demo lock?
[241:35.88]I have no idea.
[241:36.94]That one seems alright, though, because it's got haste on it, too.
[241:39.98]Which is most important.
[241:42.62]Good luck here, stealth, by the way.
[241:43.85]I turned them all in, I'm good.
[241:45.11]I don't even know what we're getting here.
[241:48.15]We're getting items.
[241:49.19]It wants me to go inside?
[241:52.09]No, no, no.
[241:53.79]Shit, there's even more.
[241:56.02]There's even more to do.
[241:57.04]Be careful.
[241:59.71]Alright, okay stealth.
[242:01.37]I'm gonna be completely serious The next time you have to no no no not here listen the next time you have to do one like that You have to mute your mic because what's happening is you're blowing out your microphone, and it is like It's like probably hurting everybody's ears so like seriously like in all seriousness If you're gonna cough that loud, please God mute your microphone Yeah, I am yelling at you at this point because you're probably hurting people's fucking ears.
[242:26.65]Oh
[242:28.31]You gotta listen to me, son.
[242:29.83]You guys are watching a mean streamer.
[242:31.87]I don't know why you're watching him.
[242:34.71]I mean, these little snorts now, that's fine.
[242:37.53]But, like, if you're gonna go, like... Like, you are peaking your microphone and it's hurting everyone.
[242:46.52]I thought I was sick.
[242:47.36]Alright.
[242:48.58]I'm gonna watch a different World of Warcraft streamer.
[242:50.84]I'm gonna watch the ones that are nice to me.
[242:54.59]You gotta get some, like, table manners.
[242:59.67]Do you put your arms up on the table too?
[243:04.13]You probably put both your arms on the table.
[243:05.59]I bet you don't even wash your fucking hands before you eat either.
[243:08.65]We need to find a new shaman.
[243:11.90]I want to jump up there with my zebra, come on.
[243:13.84]This guy's...
[243:23.70]This guy's a wrestler, shall we?
[243:24.74]He's been healing us with his dirty hands.
[243:26.84]Where's Debwin Pass, aren't we?
[243:28.64]I completed the quests.
[243:30.66]Not this one.
[243:31.04]He wants me to do.
[243:32.67]Gotta go put things on the ceilings.
[243:36.23]You gotta talk to 1J.
[243:44.62]Now I don't know what he wants me to do.
[243:46.30]Premium pillow.
[243:47.24]Jeremy, keep bullying him for 500 bits.
[243:49.37]Oh, no.
[243:51.85]Thanks, dude.
[243:52.45]I'm not bullying him.
[243:53.33]I'm trying to... I'm trying to... Look, that... I'm trying to make it so... Not condition.
[244:00.26]It's just like... Even if you cough, you can cough.
[244:03.38]But when you cough loud, like that.
[244:05.60]Like that.
[244:06.82]That's loud?
[244:07.56]It's peaking.
[244:08.40]It's peaking the mic and it's making this horrible fucking cracking sound.
[244:12.95]It's like...
[244:16.55]So for the love of God, for all of our sakes.
[244:20.97]Just like, press the button.
[244:22.42]Press the little button.
[244:23.88]Alright, I'm waiting at the next area for you.
[244:30.34]I'm just going to do this all.
[244:32.64]I'm just going to wait.
[244:34.94]I wait for nice people.
[244:42.29]He's peeking.
[244:44.05]He's a peeker.
[244:46.31]Is this one underground again?
[244:48.31]Or is this the new one above ground?
[244:49.55]For some reason, I don't think I'm supposed to be down here.
[245:05.57]What is above us?
[245:06.88]What the hell is that?
[245:14.34]Maybe I do have to go down.
[245:18.39]Well, if I'm looking, I hear the old Karazhan attunement way back in the day.
[245:22.61]One person had to be attuned and get the key.
[245:24.61]Maybe that's the case.
[245:26.41]I doubt it.
[245:27.69]Is it down?
[245:28.91]I didn't read the chat.
[245:29.85]What's your quest?
[245:31.71]Power of Corruption?
[245:33.33]Yeah.
[245:35.95]Is it just down where we were before?
[245:37.51]Down in the first area we were.
[245:45.17]Is this Zelda?
[245:45.75]Yeah, this is The Legend of Zelda.
[245:48.93]A wind waker to the past.
[245:59.80]I guess I can't be in combat while I do this.
[246:07.15]Hello.
[246:09.37]Look, I'm one of you now.
[246:11.49]Does that mean I can go through?
[246:17.42]Yeah, you just have to kill two people in here.
[246:26.45]Kill them.
[246:26.87]Get out of here.
[246:31.87]Oh, this guy.
[246:33.10]Why is he invalid?
[246:35.22]Invalid.
[246:35.62]Do I have to be?
[246:37.36]No, I guess I can't be, like, there's one of these little shits.
[246:45.39]I have no fucking idea what is even going on.
[246:49.17]You have to get out of your, uh, furry form to be able to attack things.
[246:54.15]I would much rather, like, be able to do this phased in with, like, less than, like, 40 people.
[247:01.28]It's hard to, like, it's hard to take in the investigation of Karazhan when there's bodies everywhere.
[247:06.67]The legions will be done.
[247:19.46]Are you afraid to fight?
[247:20.62]Interesting.
[247:21.52]God, this guy died.
[247:28.93]Oh, I'm dying so quickly.
[247:35.65]I don't need to even kill this person.
[247:36.83]I need to kill the other guy.
[247:42.68]That's the guy.
[247:43.30]Wait, what?
[247:45.08]What is this?
[247:45.68]Oh, okay.
[247:49.13]We get an 850 ring for doing Karazhan, but I don't need rings.
[247:53.09]What are the stats on it?
[247:54.87]Quilt Strike and Mastery.
[248:02.22]That's actually perfect.
[248:03.64]I can't wait to get that.
[248:04.28]I'm ready to go into Karazhan now, I think.
[248:05.72]I'm going to have to speak to Mr. Dalaran himself.
[248:11.75]You don't have to, but I am going to go to Dalaran so I can... What are you talking about?
[248:17.94]Alright, do we know if that's a possibility?
[248:20.64]Can we maybe get in here?
[248:24.50]Or does you have to do the attunement?
[248:28.40]I'm going to bet every legendary I have, all two, that I have to do the attunement.
[248:35.10]Do you queue for Karazhan, or how does that work?
[248:37.07]No, it's a mythic.
[248:38.89]Oh.
[248:40.95]Even so, honestly, I'm going to go to bed soon anyway.
[248:47.51]Oh my gosh.
[248:48.19]There's a burp.
[248:48.63]I told you, see?
[248:49.95]We got a burp stream.
[248:51.58]It's worse when you're here in person.
[248:53.98]Thought it was bad before.
[248:57.02]As long as my burps don't peak the mic.
[248:59.24]No, your coughs are, like, digging into my brain and, like, staying there.
[249:04.58]They're drilling a hole in my head and staying there for vacation.
[249:07.45]Who did you turn this into?
[249:12.85]Somebody up here.
[249:28.76]Take the portal of Dalaran.
[249:30.58]Look at these mailboxes.
[249:36.04]I gotta just take them.
[249:39.06]Just take them.
[249:39.58]Just take them.
[249:44.61]Now back to Dalaran.
[249:48.53]Let me look.
[249:48.93]I want to actually look at these quests.
[249:50.81]How do we get back to Karazhan?
[249:54.71]Isn't there a portal in the old chamber, that center chamber?
[249:59.21]I don't know.
[250:02.87]Go look.
[250:05.15]Where's the portal to Dalaran?
[250:06.49]Is it back here?
[250:07.21]Aren't you a mage?
[250:14.07]Yeah, but I feel like the quest, it's taking the portal to Dalaran over Karazhan.
[250:17.88]Is there a quest for that?
[250:20.02]Is there a quest for that, yeah.
[250:25.14]There's a quest for that.
[250:25.86]It says take the portal to Dalaran over Karazhan in Stormwind.
[250:30.36]Oh, right.
[250:31.76]In Stormwind.
[250:33.50]Okay.
[250:35.84]Portal to Karazhan.
[250:36.46]Did I forget to accept that quest?
[250:37.56]What's that quest called?
[250:39.11]Take the portal to Dalaran over Karazhan in Stormwind Keep.
[250:46.21]I can't.
[250:48.01]Why?
[250:48.31]Is this a mage thing?
[250:51.22]But why is that worded like that?
[250:52.40]Take the portal to Dalaran over Karazhan in Stormwind Keep.
[250:59.07]What the fuck?
[251:03.77]Turma gets lost again.
[251:04.87]Yeah, I know.
[251:07.65]Alright, I'll be right back in one second.
[251:08.69]Find us a mythic group for this dungeon.
[251:10.27]I'll be right back.
[251:12.05]Good check on Mariah.
[251:16.31]Dalaran is above you.
[251:18.25]That's Dalaran now?
[251:19.19]They moved it again?
[251:25.18]I'm just fucking teleporting.
[251:28.16]Hold on, I got a bird after me.
[251:29.93]Hold on, dudes.
[251:34.67]Ah, you're not worth it.
[251:35.87]You're not worth it.
[251:39.01]Yeah.
[251:42.57]What's going on, Grimman?
[251:43.41]Thanks for your sub, Grimman342.
[251:57.15]Alright, I want to actually see what you get for doing this Karazhan.
[252:06.60]It's actually not even that much better.
[252:13.80]Guest chamber.
[252:14.54]Okay.
[252:19.54]And then whatever the defeat is, the Watcher and Karazhan.
[252:24.02]Just a shitload of artifact power.
[252:25.28]Alright.
[252:27.33]So, for the purposes of tonight, who wants to go to Karazhan?
[252:36.06]I think I'm going to have subs take precedence over this.
[252:43.02]Just because this is one of those situations where we're going to be in here for a while.
[252:49.26]So if you are a sub to this channel and you have eye level... What's eye level?
[252:56.14]What's Karazhan for eye level?
[252:59.24]Like 850?
[252:59.58]I have absolutely no idea.
[253:03.10]What's the gear like in there?
[253:05.46]I think it's like 850 or 855.
[253:06.54]If you are attuned to Karazhan and you'd like to come,
[253:19.22]Yeah, probably 850.
[253:20.48]845, 850.
[253:21.96]If you have eye level 845 plus, preferably 850, and you are attuned, please send me a message and tell me who you are in chat.
[253:39.46]850?
[253:44.82]We need a DPS and a healer and a tank.
[253:50.12]And we're probably gonna die.
[253:51.76]So, just if you're aware.
[253:53.56]Be aware.
[253:53.94]I'm on my way.
[254:06.15]Let me make a WoW account real quick.
[254:16.65]By the way, thank you, Ramirez the Gnome, for six months.
[254:18.83]Welcome back, dude.
[254:20.33]Much appreciated.
[254:23.86]Your eye level has to be higher than the view count.
[254:25.74]864.
[254:26.72]Yeah, you have to be alliance, too.
[254:41.20]Oh, gosh.
[254:45.79]I'm downloading 40 gigs of WoW.
[254:47.51]Hold on a second.
[255:01.93]Is this going to do a cutscene?
[255:06.52]It might.
[255:06.80]Oh, this is going to be loud.
[255:08.78]Warning.
[255:09.52]Cutscene is going to be loud.
[255:15.43]Shut up.
[255:16.51]Shut up, Khadgar.
[255:22.79]Alright, let's get over there.
[255:29.86]That is correct, Boo is in the call, but Boo will not be joining us.
[255:32.70]Boo is not attuned.
[255:33.60]Yeah, I'm just some, you know, world questing alt pleb.
[255:40.92]Also, I'm sorry this was brief, but I'm going to go take some medicine and begin my winding down for the evening.
[255:46.81]Yeah, take it easy, dude.
[255:48.55]Yeah, have fun in Cara.
[255:49.75]Tell me all about it tomorrow.
[255:51.17]I will.
[255:51.55]Bye-bye.
[255:52.27]Take care.
[255:53.93]Thanks a lot, Varath.
[255:54.87]Welcome.
[255:58.69]Alright.
[256:02.25]It doesn't look like there are any subs, I don't think, that are of the eye level that's required to do this.
[256:09.38]So if you're a non-sub, it's now open to you.
[256:13.00]Eye level somewhere around 850.
[256:17.28]And let's go get our asses kicked on Karazin for a couple hours.
[256:22.94]That cutscene is watchable.
[256:24.04]It's Harbringers.
[256:24.88]It is the Khadgar Harbringers cutscene.
[256:27.14]You can watch it.
[256:27.60]It came out about six or seven months ago.
[256:31.61]If you'd like to see it, it's on YouTube.
[256:42.74]I pronounced your name right.
[256:43.56]That's good.
[256:46.80]Not attuned.
[256:47.46]Yeah, not very... We might have to get some randoms.
[256:50.09]I feel like we're like the only... In like the five percentile that's actually attuned to this.
[257:01.83]Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[257:06.65]Okay, I'm just making sure this was not turned off.
[257:14.63]I don't know.
[257:16.63]We might have to just do a pug.
[257:19.22]Because the attunement is sort of staggering.
[257:21.62]It does take a few hours to do it, and I'm not sure how many people have done it yet.
[257:27.13]considering me and stealth are the only two out of the four of us that play that have been attuned, so.
[257:34.46]Any DPS, any tank, any heal, want to go?
[257:35.98]850 eye level?
[257:39.32]Otherwise, we're going to pug it.
[257:44.69]Do I watch the flash?
[257:45.63]I do not watch the flash.
[257:48.69]I've seen maybe like an episode or two, I think, but I don't really watch it.
[257:56.51]The attunement is you have to do four different mythic dungeons to open it up.
[258:05.23]I'm curious how many people are bugging this right now.
[258:10.70]Dungeons, let's see.
[258:14.00]Kara attunement.
[258:15.30]These people are doing attunement.
[258:16.74]Karazhan must be attuned.
[258:19.49]Must also know basic dungeoneering skills.
[258:23.01]They need two DPS.
[258:28.02]I think I'm going to sign us up for this.
[258:30.66]Yeah, I am.
[258:36.10]Sign it up.
[258:37.16]Let's do it.
[258:38.78]Oh, Stealth, I hope you're here.
[258:43.89]I hope Stealth is here because this is like a perfect group for us just to get two DPS in here.
[258:47.45]Stealth!
[258:52.59]Stealth!
[258:56.80]Where's MLC stealth?
[259:02.13]Why can't I just pick the role for him?
[259:14.59]He's just not here.
[259:25.71]Well, okay, we're gonna miss it on this group.
[259:29.98]Why is everybody sick?
[259:33.70]Everybody I know is fucking sick right now.
[259:45.97]Am I the only person in World of Warcraft that doesn't have, like, a head cold?
[259:57.57]Oh, hi, Jerma.
[259:58.13]Just finished the first sorcery myself.
[259:59.55]I didn't accomplish much.
[260:03.79]Well, thanks a lot for the 500, dude.
[260:05.99]Mink fur.
[260:07.23]Did you like it?
[260:07.84]I hope you liked it.
[260:13.32]Part 1 is actually the least engaging of them all.
[260:17.28]It's very, very straightforward.
[260:18.22]It's very short, too.
[260:19.00]You can beat Part 1 in like an hour or two.
[260:24.27]Oh, we lost our chance here.
[260:27.51]See if there's any more.
[260:29.93]Thing for Kara.
[260:33.17]Thing for Kara.
[260:36.55]LLC stuff went AFK.
[260:37.53]He snorted his pants.
[260:43.07]I just want to do Kara's end.
[260:44.83]Are there any streamers streaming this game right now that I can go?
[260:50.64]Who's streaming WoW right now?
[260:53.06]And are they in a full group?
[260:54.42]And have they done it yet?
[260:56.00]And do I know who they are?
[260:59.09]I mean like who's streaming this game.
[261:01.75]Let's see if there's any like other people playing it.
[261:03.61]Let's see Twitch Hey, I'm streaming this game too.

[261:40.60]And so much more.
[261:42.97]Most of all, let your worries eat some snacks.
[261:48.67]I don't know any of these people.
[261:49.61]I don't know anybody, guys.
[261:53.69]Hey, what's the ETA on Karazhan?
[261:55.57]The ETA is we're going to try to find somebody else streaming this game and trying to do Karazhan.
[261:59.67]Streaming?
[262:01.73]Yeah, we're gonna find, like, somebody else streaming Karazhan and, like, see if, like, they're in yet.
[262:05.29]And, like, try to get in their group.
[262:07.11]Why is no one doing this?
[262:08.47]Uh, well, it's funny you say that.
[262:10.93]Uh, there was just a perfect group for us, but you weren't here.
[262:13.70]What?

[262:38.54]What do you mean, I'll be back in 10 minutes?
[262:40.00]It doesn't take 10 minutes for chicken, are you kidding me?
[262:42.30]It takes like 30 minutes.
[262:43.32]It's already made, it's to go, and it's 5 minutes away, so 5 minutes drive there, 5 minutes away.
[262:47.50]Whatever fucking happened to playing Karazhan tonight?
[262:50.27]I'm playing it.
[262:50.95]Mariah, do you want to go alone?
[262:52.87]He doesn't want to go alone, she said.
[262:56.01]Alright, well, I'm not gonna wait for you.
[262:58.57]What happened, Mariah?
[262:59.19]If I can find, like, a group of people, I'm finding them.

[263:05.93]I'm trying to, I'm trying to, I got, in my title it says Karazhan, and I'm sitting there riding my fucking zebra.
[263:11.38]Mariah, it's like two inches away.
[263:15.50]She doesn't like driving even though it's two minutes away.
[263:19.66]Am I about to change games?
[263:21.74]No.
[263:22.08]Because I don't have any fucking friends to play this game, apparently.
[263:26.54]That nobody always talked about on launch day.
[263:29.50]We were gonna all fucking play this and all the sudden like I'm the only damn person here Just me.

[264:04.78]It was perfect.
[264:05.22]It needed two DPS.
[264:06.56]They were like no basic Dungeoneerings.
[264:11.21]Just make your own Karazhan group.
[264:12.31]I didn't even spill Karazhan.

[265:02.83]I don't know who these people are.
[265:04.21]They're gonna think we're not English speakers and they're gonna kick us.
[265:15.03]You didn't even do it right.
[265:17.41]That's not how you spell it?
[265:20.55]Should I tell these people that I'm streaming?
[265:22.47]Is that like a thing that you do?
[265:24.88]To like make sure... Hi guys.
[265:27.86]I'm streaming this dumb game.
[265:29.59]That's party etiquette.
[265:33.44]You must inform them.
[265:40.53]Oh, well don't leak your- what?
[265:42.74]Yeah, no, I- they're gonna know- they're gonna want to know where.
[265:45.64]Well, no, you're linking, like, your channel, like, you're trying to, like, I need viewers, please come watch.
[265:50.34]No, no, I'm just trying to let them know, like, that this is happening.
[265:53.77]Jeez.
[265:54.17]I didn't know that you had to advertise yourself all across the game.
[265:58.03]No, could somebody be like, wait, wait, wait, I'm getting fucking broadcast somewhere?
[266:01.07]Like, where?
[266:01.67]Like, I'm gonna know.
[266:05.52]I don't know, Blizzard needs to, like... That's not me advertising.
[266:08.28]I, like, I don't know.
[266:11.06]I wouldn't do that if I didn't, like, want them to make sure that they knew.
[266:16.33]That's not sh- What?
[266:18.47]I don't care if these fucking two guys come or don't come.
[266:23.29]I mean... I don't know.
[266:24.53]Okay, no, Etalyx.
[266:25.53]Etalyx telling me, like, oh, yeah, I didn't start a stream at 7 o'clock.
[266:28.95]Oh, well, guess what?
[266:29.83]It's gonna take you four hours to get it tuned, and you didn't fucking do that shit now, did ya?
[266:44.43]The people playing with you don't know that, though.
[266:47.76]They don't even care anyways.
[266:49.48]They're just like, yeah, who gives a shit?
[266:50.74]This guy's a fucking loser.
[266:52.64]Who cares?
[266:53.00]I have to get those other two people to come watch the stream.
[267:08.50]I don't know you're such a seller.
[267:09.40]Alright, I'm gonna... What am I... Make sure you, uh... Fuck, I need to prepare.
[267:14.44]Uh, excuse me.
[267:15.30]Yeah, what is it?
[267:16.93]Do I need to be in here to defend myself?
[267:19.32]Yeah, even if I started at 7, it would have taken you at least 3 or 4 hours to get it tuned.
[267:22.74]Hey, listen here.
[267:23.88]And you said you had to go work.
[267:25.93]When I woke up at my normal time, you had already been streaming for 3 hours.
[267:32.17]Yeah, because it came out way earlier.
[267:34.55]It was supposed to come out at like 2 or 3.
[267:35.81]There was also 2 full days prior to this that I have not seen you.
[267:42.30]Wait, what the hell are you talking about?
[267:45.26]What the fuck are you talking about?
[267:46.58]What the hell are you talking about?
[267:48.98]I've been here every day.
[268:02.78]We were talking yesterday in this call.
[268:04.82]Incorrect.
[268:05.76]What the fuck are you talking about?
[268:07.88]Stone is the only person I spoke to yesterday.
[268:10.40]That's not even true.
[268:11.89]Wow.
[268:12.51]Okay, someone's having time loss here.
[268:14.99]That's not even fucking true.
[268:19.23]Alright, do we just walk in?
[268:21.11]I think.
[268:22.93]You want to start some drama?
[268:23.85]I'll start some fucking drama with you.
[268:25.07]I'm taking off my shirt for this one.
[268:30.92]What?
[268:33.06]What?
[268:34.96]What?
[268:35.28]What?
[268:35.75]What?
[268:37.29]Wait, maybe it's... Oh, I went to the wrong one.
[268:43.69]Hold on.
[268:44.55]What happened?
[268:45.03]It's okay, I thought.
[268:47.07]Where's the entrance?
[268:49.97]What?
[268:50.43]What?
[268:52.12]Everyone spammed Jerm or Jupiter for some drama.
[268:57.12]Okay, there's another entrance.
[268:58.14]I was going to the wrong entrance.
[268:59.60]What's this mini thing?
[269:01.38]This mini dark portal.
[269:04.43]Facecam?
[269:05.13]You want to see?
[269:05.61]Okay, I'm turning the fucking facecam on because this is just a shit show right now.
[269:16.01]You guys want to get a facecam?
[269:17.14]I have to put this back on because I don't have any clothes on.
[269:22.84]Is that the right thing?
[269:25.71]Look, I'm not crazy.
[269:28.29]I streamed on the 23rd, which was two days ago.
[269:31.55]I have not spoken to you since before then.
[269:35.57]I spoke to you fucking last today afternoon.
[269:37.90]I told you that, hey, you better be fucking attuned.
[269:40.44]Because if I had, I would have talked to you about my favorite TV show, Westworld.
[269:44.66]Boo got sick and disappeared.
[269:49.04]Stubbed my fucking toe this morning.
[269:51.06]Piece of glass went into my arm.
[269:52.94]Yeah, I didn't tell you that story.
[269:53.88]How do I get attuned?
[269:55.57]Oh god damn it.
[269:58.35]Get me the fuck outta here.
[270:00.09]I'm gonna go play like fuckin' Super Mario Brothers.
[270:03.90]How do I get it tuned?
[270:08.94]Fuck.
[270:17.05]Hey guys, I'm in Karazhan.
[270:19.21]Who's that?
[270:20.53]It's Berthold!
[270:22.96]What does he have to say?
[270:24.32]Look at this place, this is Karazhan, just like I remember it.
[270:26.66]Where are you?
[270:28.04]I'm in Karazhan.
[270:29.54]You're in the wrong part of it.
[270:30.78]I know.
[270:31.58]Because this is a fucking joke.
[270:33.02]I'm gonna aggro the whole fucking instance.
[270:43.41]Got him!
[270:45.71]Are you okay?
[270:59.96]Super Mario Maker stream.

[271:04.56]Oh yeah, I'm supposed to turn my facecam on.
[271:11.95]Alright, what part of... Where do we... Where's the actual entrance?
[271:20.19]Where we are all standing.
[271:28.95]Look at this teeny tiny entrance.
[271:32.24]Well, I ain't going in until we have, like, everybody here.
[271:34.18]I'm just gonna turn my fucking facecam on and, like, shout out people.
[271:41.48]Isn't that what I'm supposed to be doing, right?
[271:42.78]Let's see who... Let's turn it on.
[271:44.63]Blink your stream again.
[271:45.37]This is fucking ridiculous.
[271:58.65]I'm just gonna go take a bath.
[272:00.13]You wanna see a stream bath?
[272:01.75]I'm gonna stream myself in a bath.
[272:03.65]Alright, here we go.
[272:13.15]Let's see how shitty I look right now.
[272:16.08]Like I'm doing this thing right now.
[272:17.54]You guys want like a tip?
[272:19.98]I'll give you guys a tip.
[272:21.92]Here's a tip for you guys, ready?
[272:27.02]My color correction is all fucked up on this thing.
[272:30.18]Alright, here's the tip.
[272:34.38]Look at my hair.
[272:35.28]My hair is all fucked up and everything.
[272:36.88]I don't give a shit.
[272:38.98]Here's the tip.
[272:40.16]Secret tip.

[272:43.30]I'll see you guys over here.
[272:44.98]So, if you guys want a secret tip.
[272:47.02]If you take a look at this.
[272:47.82]Hold on, I've got to color correct this.
[272:51.57]Because I look like a fucking zombie.
[273:01.04]uh here white balance there we go my white balance is like all the way on the other side alright secret tip if you didn't know if you guys need to go somewhere and you don't feel like putting clothes on it's actually a pretty good technique you grab like a sweatshirt that zip up like a zip up sweatshirt just zip it up over naked body doesn't even matter it's like trying to auto correct
[273:29.52]Look at this hair.
[273:30.12]It's like... What a fucking great stream, huh?
[273:41.77]See, I'm naked under these clothes.
[273:43.09]You know that, right?
[273:47.95]I need a haircut.
[273:49.72]I think your hair looks really good right now.
[273:51.40]You think this looks good?
[273:52.84]Yeah.
[273:53.34]I'm like tired looking.
[273:54.42]I look like hell.
[273:56.24]I think...
[273:57.35]I think you look better now than you've looked in a long time.
[274:00.57]I think you look really good.
[274:03.35]I like the way you look.
[274:07.36]That's what we've resorted to on this stream.
[274:09.48]You understand that, right?
[274:10.18]That's what we've resorted to.
[274:11.08]That.
[274:13.50]Surprised any of you guys are still here watching this.
[274:22.52]Where are we going in here?
[274:24.32]In this building?
[274:26.14]Oh, open up.
[274:26.74]Knock, knock.
[274:27.36]Please let me in.
[274:29.00]What are you guys saying about me?
[274:29.88]What are you guys saying about me?
[274:30.70]I need to know.
[274:31.93]What the fuck are they saying about me?
[274:35.01]We're waiting for a tank.
[274:36.05]What did that guy just say?
[274:39.65]That guy just said I look like shit.
[274:40.93]Ban that guy.
[274:42.97]Jerba, you look fucking, you look like shit.
[274:45.22]Permanently ban that guy.
[274:48.87]But yeah, I've been doing this technique.
[274:51.11]If you don't feel like doing laundry, you don't feel like putting clothes on, just put a zip-up on and zip it all the way up.
[274:55.87]Nobody knows.
[274:57.13]What are they going to try?
[274:57.75]Oh, what is it?
[274:58.57]You must not have a shirt on under that.
[275:00.69]Prove it.
[275:05.81]I didn't talk to Khadgar in Dalaran?
[275:07.20]Yeah, I did.
[275:09.10]Isn't this optional?
[275:09.96]This shit is optional.
[275:10.74]Oh, fucking hell.
[275:13.40]I'll be right back.
[275:16.28]Speak to Archmage Khadgar in Dalaran.
[275:27.01]Did I seriously just gain like a hundred viewers because I turned on a facecam?
[275:31.33]Yeah.
[275:32.45]Daily coincidence.
[275:33.73]Ow, shit!
[275:34.37]Alright, fine.
[275:37.65]Let's like get some viewers, huh?
[275:41.83]There.
[275:45.72]Look, I'm a streamer.
[275:48.84]I just lost it.
[275:49.58]Shit.
[275:49.80]Everybody subscribe and donate so this poor streamer can afford a green screen.
[275:55.12]Let me get some, like, hair gel, too.
[275:56.36]Let me go like this.
[276:05.40]Can we get up to, like, 2,000 viewers like this?
[276:13.44]Hold on.
[276:16.20]We're gonna do, like, the mad scientist.
[276:23.53]See, it's funny to me now, but like when I see somebody screen capping this and showing it to me, I'm going to be like, oh, fuck.
[276:29.00]I look like a real dickhead.
[276:33.58]Alright.
[276:35.04]Where am I going?
[276:35.66]It looks like I'm marching over like, oh, yes, let me see what my, like, child is up to.
[276:42.77]Oh, yes, my child.
[276:43.79]Keep moving in Dalaran.
[276:45.93]Oh, look at that.
[276:46.53]No, do jump for me.
[276:47.77]Yes, do another jump.
[276:49.19]Good jump.
[276:56.52]It's a fucking disaster.
[277:00.10]Alright, see you later.
[277:04.60]Where's my dog?
[277:07.53]You don't look a day over 50 is what somebody just said.
[277:09.89]Well, thanks.
[277:15.43]I don't know why Blizzard even put an attunement on this shit.
[277:23.88]Career ending stream.
[277:26.98]Hold on a second.
[277:27.54]This is going to be funny.
[277:29.50]How long does Karazhan take?
[277:31.16]Probably like four hours.
[277:32.10]Because I have to scrim in an hour and a half.
[277:35.80]Jesus.
[277:37.93]I had like, okay, let me just say something.
[277:40.21]I had this like grand thing in my brain like, oh, we're going to be here.
[277:43.35]It's going to have fun in Karazhan.
[277:44.57]It's going to be so much fun.
[277:45.85]Man, it doesn't look like that's even going to happen.
[277:51.94]I have five total friends.
[277:55.53]Yeah, you would have had to know for sure that all of your friends were going to be here.
[278:00.25]There wasn't like backups.
[278:01.31]There's no extras.
[278:02.53]It would have to be 100% attendance.
[278:14.69]Stream sucks.
[278:16.83]Get naked.
[278:17.57]No.
[278:27.06]Why am I gaining viewers?
[278:28.84]This is the worst World of Warcraft stream that you accidentally clicked on.
[278:34.19]You don't want to be here right now.
[278:35.53]I'm currently about to pug Karazhan with one friend.
[278:40.27]I don't have any friends.
[278:44.05]I wonder how many people have clicked on this stream like, Oh, Karazhan?
[278:46.63]Okay, cool!
[278:47.71]And it's just some dickhead standing around in Dalaran.
[278:56.52]What have we resorted to?
[278:59.98]Okay, we got a tank.
[279:00.58]We got a tank.
[279:01.87]I gotta talk to fucking Khadgar.
[279:04.39]I gotta talk to him.
[279:05.21]Let me talk to Khadgar.
[279:05.83]Let me just, like, start, like, let me walk to Khadgar.
[279:08.79]There we go.
[279:09.07]Let me just, like, start walking.
[279:23.75]I don't know why that's so funny to me.
[279:25.89]It just is.
[279:33.57]Dude, I feel bad for the poor people that just came here and are like, this guy's fucked.
[279:37.71]I don't even... This guy's a loser.
[279:41.35]What is this guy doing?
[279:45.79]Alright, talk to Khadgar.
[279:47.11]You got it.
[279:48.83]We're all inside right now waiting on Jerma.
[279:50.65]I can't even talk to Khadgar.
[279:51.77]Summon me.
[279:53.22]We're...
[279:54.39]No.
[279:55.23]Take a portal.
[279:55.79]We're all waiting.
[279:56.45]All four of us are in there waiting for you.
[279:58.15]I can't even talk to Khadgar.
[280:03.53]Hi.
[280:03.83]Hello.
[280:06.55]How do I get back there?
[280:08.03]Where's the portal?
[280:08.61]Go through that middle thing.
[280:10.33]Oh, the chain.
[280:10.87]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[280:14.84]I know where it is.
[280:16.60]Should I link them the, uh, link them the Discord?
[280:22.84]I actually do want to, like, pay attention to this and, like, play this, so... Stop it.
[280:30.69]You made fun of me for doing that, now you just did it.
[280:33.99]I'm helping you out.
[280:34.65]You know, you don't have the... Alright.
[280:36.93]You don't have the kahunas to do it twice in a row.
[280:39.87]Did you say kahunas?
[280:41.75]Yeah.
[280:43.61]Kahunas.
[280:45.71]Yeah.
[280:45.97]It's kahones.
[280:47.59]Kahunas.
[280:49.97]Maybe that's how you pronounce it.
[280:51.03]Oh, welcome to Karazhan!
[280:56.43]God.
[280:59.52]Get me the fuck out of there.
[281:01.22]Am I too late to join Karazhan?
[281:02.58]You are, unfortunately.
[281:03.60]I'm sorry.
[281:07.14]Alright, here we go.
[281:08.78]It's time for Karazhan.
[281:09.90]Finally.
[281:11.13]Let's see.
[281:11.59]This is the dungeon you've been waiting for.
[281:13.09]Hey, everybody!
[281:24.16]I'm here.
[281:24.70]Huh.
[281:28.17]Alright, how do we play this game first?
[281:30.48]Uh, I don't know.
[281:31.94]It's all new to us.
[281:33.98]It's all new!
[281:34.58]It's new content!
[281:35.56]Karazin!
[281:39.06]Oh, fuck this shit.
[281:40.14]I'm out.
[281:41.90]I scared at least one guy away.
[281:43.26]Yeah, we got a spirit.
[281:48.42]Alright, I need to reset Skada.
[281:50.36]There we go.
[281:58.06]Alright, no more screwing around.
[282:00.08]I'm going to play.
[282:01.06]This is something I've been looking forward to, so let's experience it.
[282:14.83]Cool.
[282:16.15]Dude, Karazhan's out, guys.
[282:19.03]Karazhan is out, boys and girls.
[282:20.92]Oh, I didn't even...
[282:23.20]I don't know.
[282:23.46]I'm just following the tank, man.
[282:25.76]That's probably the best bet for all of our sakes.
[282:35.45]For everybody's sake.
[282:38.95]Fuck you.
[282:39.43]Your face game almost made me throw up from laughing.
[282:46.99]Puts on the face game plus 200 viewers.
[282:49.05]I know.
[282:49.83]That really just happened.
[282:54.36]I'm just gonna like duct tape my whole body and like turn it on again.
[283:06.97]Alrighty.
[283:08.57]This is cool.
[283:09.17]We're like up on the balconies right now, huh?
[283:14.37]So this is gonna be... So how it used to work before, from what I remember, it was the opera.
[283:22.40]It could be three different... Whoa!
[283:27.15]Okay, we lose.
[283:40.32]You were just so mad.
[283:42.10]You were so like pissed off right there.
[283:43.84]Like, can't we lose?
[283:49.30]Alright, so they do.
[283:50.04]We can't pull that many, I guess.
[283:54.66]Let's look in the dungeon journal.
[283:56.78]We almost beat Karazhan.
[284:00.23]Really close.
[284:01.41]So those guys, if you get too many of them, they just all spam all over the ground.
[284:08.55]Actually, I probably should make some of these for the healer.
[284:12.71]What the fuck?
[284:13.83]What just happened?
[284:15.95]I didn't even press Arcane Explosion.
[284:17.99]It just happened.
[284:20.25]Is that something we can interrupt, or is it just they just put it down on the ground randomly?
[284:26.04]I have no clue.
[284:31.54]Yeah, there it is.
[284:32.10]Yep.
[284:37.03]There's a lot of those.
[284:38.51]Especially when you have like five people doing it at the same time.
[284:44.29]What happened to my Twitch alerts?
[284:46.73]Hey, good damage per second, Shaka.
[284:47.93]That was really good.
[284:50.41]When I have zero arcane charges, I'm useless.
[284:52.06]You know that.
[284:54.23]We're going to die again?
[284:55.83]I don't think so.
[284:59.15]I don't think so.
[284:59.95]Right, because I stunned everybody.
[285:07.96]He's going to do it again.
[285:08.74]I don't think he can interrupt it either.
[285:11.36]Ah, there it is.
[285:20.98]I need a target.
[285:24.43]I need to move.
[285:25.87]And that whole... Oh my god.
[285:27.75]I need like another monitor so bad.
[285:29.47]You need three?
[285:31.76]Yeah, two monitors just ain't fucking cutting it.
[285:34.22]At all.
[285:35.18]You need the third one for?
[285:37.36]The whole one would just be chat.
[285:38.74]Because it's like hard.
[285:39.60]I'm juggling like five windows on this tiny 19 inch monitor to my right.
[285:43.55]Don't forget to loot the corpses too.
[285:45.69]That's another thing.
[285:48.67]Good blink.
[285:54.90]Did you guys go down the stairs yet?
[285:57.16]Yeah.
[286:08.34]Yeah, I need a whole entire monitor for chat so I can just kind of glance up at it.
[286:20.05]I want it above me too, like above the main monitor.
[286:28.36]Why does your guy slap his balls when he casts a spell?
[286:32.10]What?
[286:34.77]What is it?
[286:35.97]No, he doesn't.
[286:36.47]Yikes.
[286:50.26]By the way, this has to change to that.
[287:00.07]Too many buttons.
[287:04.47]Gonna play the new Dark Souls DLC?
[287:05.67]Yeah, that's the plan tomorrow.
[287:08.69]I'm gonna play the Dark Souls DLC tomorrow.
[287:13.01]That is the plan.
[287:20.80]Ooh, boy.
[287:36.24]Can I play Civ 6?
[287:38.20]No.
[287:39.78]I don't have the patience for that game.
[287:41.06]I really don't.
[287:45.65]Seems really fun, but I just can't.
[287:47.33]My brain can't do it.
[287:48.59]It's too much to have to think about.
[287:51.45]But I will be playing.
[287:52.07]Oh, here's the first.
[287:54.83]I'm not an actor.
[287:56.29]Wizard of Oz?
[287:58.90]What is this?
[287:59.94]It could be anything.
[288:00.70]It could be the Wizard of Oz.
[288:01.74]It could be Romeo and Juliet.
[288:07.86]What the fuck?
[288:11.23]Shut your jabber, drama man.
[288:13.15]The Monkey King got another plan.
[288:15.79]Tonight, we got a horkin' show.
[288:18.11]A horkin' tale you think you know.
[288:20.93]Huh.
[288:22.03]That evil crone, she's not the worst.
[288:24.97]Another witch was nasty first.
[288:27.47]Oh, is that what it was?
[288:29.37]Mm-hmm.
[288:30.51]Another path she should have chosen.
[288:34.26]So say that slur.
[288:35.78]Relax a jibbit.
[288:36.98]Wicked.
[288:37.32]Enjoy the show that we call wicked.
[288:41.22]Okay, so we got a kill-off winged assistance summoned by summoning assistants to avoid being overrun.
[288:48.94]Apparently she summons a ton of people, I guess.
[288:50.88]Pyra, come down from there.
[288:53.20]You're fluttering about like one of those horrible monkey creatures.
[288:57.25]We all deserve a chance to fly.
[288:59.89]Hey, do you really think the wizard will de-greenify me?
[289:04.66]We're going to die.
[289:05.40]We're going to wipe.
[289:07.12]Are we?
[289:08.80]I mean, probably.
[289:10.82]Why?
[289:13.90]See?
[289:14.20]You know what?
[289:15.72]You want to stream with me, Elphra?
[289:18.02]I don't have any friends either.
[289:20.70]Thanks a lot, Aureon.
[289:22.04]Aureon, for your sub.
[289:23.24]Thanks a lot.
[289:23.63]Welcome back.
[289:24.07]There's a couple I missed, too.
[289:25.03]I will definitely... Alright, hold on a second.
[289:28.47]Let me look at my dungeon thing.
[289:29.61]Wicked.
[289:32.23]Void Galindra's magic magnificent.
[289:37.36]Oh my god.
[289:37.92]Okay, that's like an instant kill.
[289:40.22]By using the... What?
[289:43.72]Avoid this by using the vortices left over from Defy Gravity.
[289:49.83]So the witch there is going to put this lady... Okay.
[289:56.89]Okie dokie.
[289:57.65]Don't want to read the journal.
[290:02.53]I'm going to have to do a fucking big burn here.
[290:05.01]I just, I probably shouldn't have done that, but I don't care.
[290:07.03]I'm going to say it was you who did it.
[290:12.01]Why are you going to do that?
[290:18.21]Is there a priority here?
[290:19.13]I'm not sure what the priority would be.
[290:29.48]She's doing something.
[290:31.10]We got to kill the monkeys.
[290:35.41]I'm out of mana already.
[290:37.07]I did not plan this at all.
[290:42.08]I'm going to drop to like 100,000 damage a second, dude.
[290:44.14]Move to defy gravity?
[290:48.30]What does that mean?
[290:50.99]What does move to defy gravity mean?
[290:52.93]I think it's those swirling things on the ground.
[290:57.55]Okay, so when she starts casting that, we have to run into these blue circles.
[291:00.67]You deserve a chance to fly.
[291:06.47]Actually, you guys might know.
[291:09.30]They're going to enrage.
[291:11.56]So these monkeys apparently are very bad.
[291:14.40]They have to die.
[291:15.38]But I fucked up my whole rotation because I was in a panic mode for no reason.
[291:29.57]Come on!
[291:34.85]Okay, so, yeah.
[291:36.11]When she has that bubble on her... Yeah, you need to purposely... Yeah, you need to purposely get hit.
[291:49.72]I think they're going to enrage.
[291:51.95]If they haven't enraged her, they're going to hit it.
[291:58.69]You deserve a chance to fly!
[292:02.51]166 million and... yeah they both have 166 million.
[292:07.55]Something tells me we probably have to focus one of them.
[292:10.23]Well, let's see.
[292:27.54]Well, now we know what happens.
[292:31.04]Besides that, I mean, do these ever go away?
[292:32.78]I don't know.
[292:34.56]Looks like they don't even go away.
[292:35.46]That fight's really good for elemental shaman, though.
[292:39.24]Is it?
[292:39.44]Oh, because there's two of them?
[292:42.24]Well, yeah, and the monkey spawn, so I'm just casting a trick over and over and over.
[292:45.72]Well, that's good.
[292:48.28]Look at my dbs.
[292:49.44]No, you had some dbs there.
[292:50.80]You did.
[292:52.22]Check the logs.
[292:55.79]Look at the abilities.
[292:56.69]Dot, dot, dot.
[292:57.41]I tried, but the guy pulled instantly.
[293:01.87]Somebody just dot dot dot you?
[293:03.27]I got dot dot dotted.
[293:04.61]I opened up my book to look and the guy pulled.
[293:11.99]I don't think we can.
[293:13.14]Yeah, we gotta go around.
[293:16.54]Just lying face down.
[293:17.46]Mariah's still not back.
[293:18.42]That was more than 10 minutes.
[293:20.34]Alright, so if you had been gone that long, I would have been playing like hard crawl by now.
[293:26.70]I don't know where she is.
[293:27.74]I hope she's okay.
[293:40.53]Let me see what the assistants do.
[293:42.01]Throw stuff.
[293:43.93]Okay, yeah, these guys gotta go.
[293:48.73]Do a quick facecam?
[293:51.89]Why don't I have subs based on the time they've subbed?
[293:54.37]Because they're being made right now.
[293:57.54]There's like an entire channel redesign coming to the channel.
[294:01.00]I'm gonna get like 10 more emotes, all new sub badges, bit animations, sub animations.
[294:05.30]There's like a ton of shit that's coming.
[294:15.15]But those little monkey guys, they do 150,000 damage every time they throw something.
[294:20.25]So they get to die.
[294:23.17]Magic.
[294:24.82]Magnificent.
[294:35.02]Alright, let's see.
[294:36.90]Besides, that's just dreary bolt.
[294:38.26]Hmm.
[294:41.92]Ugh.
[294:47.09]Flashy Bolt.
[294:48.43]Wondrous Radiance.
[294:51.70]Alright, so if you're standing around her... Okay, yeah.
[294:56.48]She does like a big AoE thing for like 1.5 million.
[294:58.86]The Galindra.
[295:01.37]But you and I won't have to be worried about that, I don't think.
[295:06.41]Alright, I think let's give it another try.
[295:11.29]For the Alliance!
[295:18.51]Alright.
[295:26.04]So there's one in the middle.
[295:37.32]And... Here come the monkeys, I think, right?
[295:48.83]Throw stuff.
[295:54.63]Kill this dude over here.
[295:56.91]Oh, nope.
[295:58.55]Oh, they disappear.
[295:59.77]They disappear.
[296:00.55]Okay, each one of us has to get in one of those.
[296:03.61]Oh, when one person flies?
[296:04.64]Yeah, when one person flies, it goes away.
[296:07.48]That's good to know.
[296:10.78]These monkeys gotta go.
[296:11.72]I'm getting hammered.
[296:20.78]Oh boy, this is hell.
[296:23.58]It really is.
[296:26.68]Hi, Mariah!
[296:31.70]Fuck.
[296:38.24]This is so bad.
[296:41.82]It's hard for me to keep my rotation up.
[296:43.38]Oh boy.
[296:48.66]Oh, Dugas.
[296:58.18]Who am I even targeting right now?
[297:13.96]It sucks.
[297:14.44]I lose all my quickening stacks when we do that.
[297:16.70]This fight is terrible for me.
[297:27.22]She's going to do it in a second here, I think.
[297:35.07]Oh, that sucks so bad.
[297:36.27]I lose all my quickening stacks.
[297:39.96]I have to keep a... I'm going to have to hold on to a arcane missiles.
[297:55.29]We're gonna kill these monkeys too.
[298:17.05]Die monkey!
[298:23.84]Oh, actually, I can cast.
[298:24.82]I'll be okay.
[298:37.49]God.
[298:40.47]We gotta get rid of these monkeys.
[298:48.34]Are you attacking the monkeys?
[298:52.86]Hello?
[298:55.69]Oh, you gotta kill the monkeys.
[298:57.39]You gotta shut up.
[298:58.89]We gotta kill the fucking monkeys, dude.
[299:03.51]Sorry for telling you to shut up.
[299:08.55]Well, you weren't even doing what you were supposed to be doing.
[299:11.71]Uh, DPS, hello.
[299:14.13]Yeah, it's not all about burning the boss.
[299:17.19]Yeah, so we killed the first boss.
[299:18.72]Uh, I think I gotta go now.
[299:20.26]You probably do, don't you?
[299:22.22]Raya's back and she wants me to eat food and watch TV with her.
[299:25.78]Oh, these people are going to hate your fucking guts.
[299:28.69]Oh my god, does he need that?
[299:40.18]That's a fucking arcane relic.
[299:47.56]That's an arcane relic, and that would get rid of my shitty 835 relics.
[299:55.28]Alright, I'm going to watch TV and eat food.
[299:58.99]Sorry.
[300:00.11]I want to finish Karazhan, but I can't.
[300:01.99]Why did you even queue?
[300:03.15]It doesn't make any sense.
[300:10.07]Now you're going to leave us with the DPS that we need.
[300:13.09]Yeah, I mean, that's going to be easy.
[300:14.33]Everyone wants to do this.
[300:19.41]Alright, well, see you later.
[300:20.53]Thanks for coming.
[300:23.26]You're going to be the one to tell everybody in this group that you're no longer fighting.
[300:37.21]My favorite boarding.
[300:39.19]Oh my god.
[300:40.05]What, baby?
[300:41.21]I already left.
[300:43.15]It's too late.
[300:43.87]Oh my god.
[300:45.53]What?
[300:46.43]I'm in your... We're in the same guild, too.
[300:48.31]These people are going to be like, what?
[300:49.51]They're going to turn to me.
[300:51.81]My flight's leaving in 10 minutes.
[300:53.59]They're boarding.
[300:54.29]I gotta take off.
[300:55.86]Alright, well, see you later.
[300:56.98]Alright, I will see you later, Jerma.
[301:01.00]Thanks for coming.
[301:02.62]See you later.
[301:03.22]Don't worry.
[301:03.58]It's not like I've been abandoned before.
[301:05.40]Yeah, I know.
[301:06.94]I'll see you later.
[301:08.29]Take it easy, dude.
[301:13.94]Spend all that time getting attuned.
[301:18.67]He's playing in the airport.
[301:22.05]Well, I hope you guys are enjoying the stream.
[301:23.77]We're like... A bunch of us play Karazhan.
[301:28.49]No, no, now it's just fucking me.
[301:30.83]Now it's just me.
[301:35.23]Now it's just me.
[301:39.10]Yeah.
[301:40.32]Hey, drink him up.
[301:41.26]Coffee.
[301:45.80]Ugh.
[301:55.83]Drink up that coffee if you got him.
[301:59.23]Did I do that?
[302:00.01]Did I do that?
[302:00.41]Did I Steve Urkel?
[302:01.09]I think I Steve Urkeled this.
[302:04.40]No, I didn't.
[302:04.76]I wouldn't have gone that far.
[302:12.84]Ah, did I get it off?
[302:13.48]Yes, I did.
[302:20.35]Oh, boy.
[302:23.41]No friends for him.
[302:29.50]God damn it.
[302:32.38]It's like, what a disaster.
[302:39.32]Thanks a lot, Chewie Rock.
[302:41.60]What do I think about vaping?
[302:44.48]I don't do it.
[302:46.14]I don't care if people do.
[302:47.35]Whatever.
[302:50.43]Thanks a lot, Irene.
[302:51.25]I think I got you already, but hello.
[302:53.79]Johnny Kravitz, thanks for eight months, man.
[302:55.51]You look nice today, almost as nice as you smell.
[302:57.54]I don't really smell that great probably right now.
[303:00.14]Thanks a lot, Johnny, for eight months.
[303:02.70]And then gggbbbabybaby, 1500 bits.
[303:05.36]I didn't even say your name, but he's the one that told me to get naked, but thanks a lot, man.
[303:09.57]Appreciate it.
[303:12.46]And then, thank you to TylerMike75, SolverJT, and StarCraftZergRush for six months.
[303:20.79]Welcome to those two new subs.
[303:22.65]And to also Niche.
[303:24.27]Niche.
[303:26.55]Niche.
[303:27.53]Hello.
[303:28.33]Welcome.
[303:28.75]Thanks a lot.
[303:30.07]I bet we like summoning this person.
[303:35.01]Feels bad.
[303:35.73]No friends.
[303:38.60]I don't know why I thought I assumed at least one or two people that I know were going to be playing this game at the launch of fucking one of the most important patches in the game's period of Legion being existing.
[303:50.97]Sue me for thinking that people were going to play 7.1 when it came out.
[303:55.65]Apparently not.
[303:56.43]We're fighting, I guess.
[304:06.55]I guess we're fighting.
[304:19.47]Lonely facecam.
[304:22.01]Now you guys get a dog cam.
[304:27.26]Here's your dog cam.
[304:33.52]You can't even see him.
[304:34.26]There you go.
[304:40.83]He'll pop his head up probably at some point.
[304:43.77]He's my only friend in the world right now.
[304:46.01]He's asleep.
[304:47.55]Does he have a computer?
[304:48.63]Can he play Karazhan?
[304:55.20]Wait, what the hell are they saying now?
[305:00.30]Oh shit, what is going on?
[305:05.30]Does the big bad wolf chase us around?
[305:21.23]Build auto a PC, yeah.
[305:22.55]I'm gonna build auto a PC and let him, uh... Let him, uh, run wild.
[305:36.64]Oh, we gotta see if this guy's done the attunement quests.
[305:40.42]Can auto do any tricks?
[305:41.54]Um, no.
[305:43.18]He can't.
[305:47.58]He cannot do any tricks.
[306:08.53]Let's see if we can get him to look up.
[306:09.71]Hey.
[306:11.75]Hey, Otto.
[306:13.39]Otto.
[306:14.65]Dog.
[306:16.07]Dog.
[306:18.63]Hey.
[306:20.75]Hey.
[306:23.01]Hey.
[306:27.28]Why are you this tired?
[306:28.42]Otto.
[306:29.36]Come here, dog.
[306:32.64]Hey.
[306:33.80]Why are you this sleepy?
[306:40.15]Who is a tired dog?
[306:42.41]Hey.
[306:44.27]What are you so tired for?
[306:46.92]He really is like out.
[306:47.62]Hold on a second.
[306:55.62]Hey.
[306:57.28]Are you alright?
[306:58.26]What are you doing?
[306:58.78]Hey.
[306:58.86]That was weird.
[307:13.87]What are you doing, little dog?
[307:17.55]Look at him.
[307:20.87]He just doesn't even want to be bothered.
[307:22.96]Why you don't want to be bothered?
[307:25.98]I don't know.
[307:26.38]He's just like, leave me alone.
[307:30.36]He doesn't want to get up at all.
[307:36.46]What are you doing?
[307:40.12]You can't be that tired.
[307:43.07]Oh yeah.
[307:51.18]It's a decoy.
[307:53.10]Yeah, Otto is sick.
[307:53.84]He can't play WoW right now.
[308:00.78]He doesn't typically do that.
[308:03.32]Usually he'll like wake up when I'm like, hi.
[308:05.58]We didn't even do anything today.
[308:08.69]We went for a walk for like 10 minutes.
[308:11.80]Yeah, you.
[308:12.76]Why are you so weird?
[308:16.50]You want the blankie back?
[308:17.98]Huh?
[308:19.84]You want his blankie back?
[308:24.59]Yeah, even my own dog doesn't even want to be my friend anymore.
[308:32.37]Oh, there's your dog, Kim.
[308:39.44]Yeah, he was not happy.
[308:41.98]Tough day for a dog.
[308:43.10]Meanwhile in Karazhan, yeah.
[308:46.14]One night in Karazhan.
[308:52.42]I'm standing here with this guy.
[308:53.72]He's looking at his map.
[309:00.26]Where are you going?
[309:04.04]Alright, I think we got a person.
[309:05.43]No more messing around.
[309:06.75]Let's do it.
[309:09.61]Will it be your friends?
[309:10.41]Yeah, at least I have like a thousand of you guys here hanging out.
[309:14.82]My only real friends is Twitch chat and my Twitch fans and my YouTube friends and my Twitch friends.
[309:26.36]He wants to go back under those covers.
[309:27.70]I'm sorry.
[309:28.16]Yeah, come here.
[309:28.50]Come here.
[309:29.16]Yeah.
[309:30.02]Want to go back under?
[309:30.91]Good dog.
[309:31.31]Yeah, there you go.
[309:31.77]Alright.
[309:38.61]Let's keep up.
[309:44.53]Alright, ripping them through here.
[309:45.61]It's kind of a weird spot.
[309:55.99]Whoa, this is a new move.
[309:57.51]I don't know what it does.
[309:58.71]Wow!
[309:59.17]I think my dog's gonna puke.
[310:04.47]What the fuck?
[310:06.14]Okay, this is like... Hold on.
[310:40.35]What the hell was that?
[310:44.44]What are you doing?
[310:47.36]He was like, I'm gonna puke.
[310:51.24]Why?
[310:51.56]That doesn't make any sense.
[310:52.24]What's wrong with you?
[310:55.10]Hey.
[310:57.41]What are you doing?
[310:59.07]He was like, I'm gonna puke.
[311:00.71]I'm gonna puke.
[311:01.93]And then he just was like, I'm fine.
[311:03.33]What the fuck?
[311:08.01]Okay, well that was weird.
[311:11.22]Are you okay?
[311:12.02]You good?
[311:14.80]Are you good?
[311:17.26]Okay.
[311:20.10]Well, it's a good thing.
[311:21.80]No, I'm like, oh, hey, Karazhan.
[311:23.34]Oh, yeah, this is fucking having a blast in Karazhan.
[311:25.61]Okay, now he... Otto just left the building.
[311:34.45]He just walked up.
[311:35.03]He's going, like, upstairs to get a drink.
[311:40.62]When was the last time he was... I can't even like pay attention to the game.
[311:45.83]Last time he was at the vet was like four days ago.
[311:48.93]Five days ago.
[311:56.41]Can I get a rez?
[311:57.27]I'm a piece of shit.
[312:13.60]Yeah, attunement did take a little while.
[312:15.97]I was in attunement for like four hours.
[312:18.89]I've been streaming since earlier this morning.
[312:21.07]Like 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock.
[312:22.25]When it got very stuttered.
[312:27.67]Showing dog people will get you banned.
[312:29.43]No, he's fine.
[312:31.53]He was just doing that thing sometimes.
[312:33.07]Like they go like... Okay, I'm back to normal.
[312:42.03]We need to get something in here.
[312:48.07]Does that pull the whole room?
[312:49.21]Thank god.
[312:49.61]I was about to get terrified.
[312:51.63]Just gotta be careful because I don't know what the hell these guys even do.
[313:09.48]I'm so scared to even get within melee range of these guys right now.
[313:21.79]Have you tried turning him off and turning it on again?
[313:23.73]Are we gonna clear this whole entire room?
[313:38.29]Probably, right?
[313:44.87]What is the next boss?
[313:50.32]I don't think we're done.
[313:50.98]Maybe we have to... Ah, we gotta collect that Karazhan Khadgar fragment.
[313:56.98]Can we do it without pulling?
[313:57.96]No, of course not.
[313:59.36]Oh!
[313:59.71]Oh, boy.
[314:19.58]I was just doing 3 million damage a second.
[314:22.96]I just did like 3 fucking million.
[314:30.48]Alrighty.
[314:31.40]That was terrifying.
[314:32.56]We did it.
[314:40.12]He's a clicker.
[314:41.70]No, no, that's not.
[314:42.68]Only one move is what I click.
[314:44.83]Only one move that I do for damage is what I click.
[314:48.52]Because I ran out of bindings and I'm too terrible to press anything else.
[315:02.77]I should probably interrupt those, right?
[315:09.07]Probably.
[315:09.41]If I wasn't such a bad player.
[315:14.00]No, I guess you can.
[315:14.58]That's uninterruptable.
[315:16.28]He just picks a random person and shoots a flashlight in their face.
[315:22.54]That seems kind of unfair.
[315:27.52]Once a clicker, always a clicker.
[315:29.44]Yeah, I click my food, my buffs, and arcane explosion.
[315:38.11]That's all I do.
[315:38.99]Those are the clicks.
[315:45.91]I'm not even going to do AOE.
[315:46.61]I'm just going to single target this idiot.
[315:52.87]I don't have a target.
[315:54.63]Oh, you actually have to look away from the flashlight.
[315:58.23]Okay.
[315:58.87]Makes sense.
[316:12.90]We're going to clear this whole room.
[316:18.89]I'm not going to dupe Mark of Alnath.
[316:20.19]They're already all dead.
[316:27.07]I barely have any time to do any damage to these guys.
[316:30.12]By the time I ramp the fuck up and do moves, they're already dead.
[316:33.04]I wonder how often I should be casting that mark of the Sinew.
[316:43.47]Wriggling Sinew.
[316:49.76]Here comes a patrol.
[316:50.94]No, I'll get in there.
[316:59.25]It's better than do some clicks.
[317:12.98]Thank you JetRocketBoy for the 500 bits.
[317:15.00]Even though you're playing WoW, I still appreciate you streaming.
[317:17.04]P.S.
[317:17.36]I'm the car gas guy.
[317:22.85]The car gas guy.
[317:30.97]New hallway.
[317:31.33]This is pretty cool looking.
[317:33.52]Didn't really get to drink, unfortunately.
[317:41.16]Call them who gives a fuck.
[317:48.91]I don't know what that does, but I'm going to interrupt it.
[317:51.33]Thanks a lot to JetRocketBoy for the 500 bits.
[317:53.51]Appreciate it, man.
[317:59.97]Control mage is too slow.
[318:01.29]Gotta go face.
[318:04.87]Only for Mythics.
[318:05.93]This is where Arcane is kind of annoying.
[318:09.03]In Raids, you have a lot of downtime between pulls, so you can get right up there again.
[318:14.77]But in Mythics, it can be pretty annoying to have to drink after every single fight.
[318:20.81]Because you never want to use any of your evocations.
[318:24.17]Because if this is not up when we get to the boss... I mean, I could do it now.
[318:27.99]But I don't know this place really at all.
[318:29.45]So I don't know how far away we are between another encounter.
[318:32.46]So evocating is not the greatest idea.
[318:51.18]Arcane Explosions I didn't even see this.
[318:56.62]Where's this guy?
[318:58.94]Oh, it's a dog.
[318:59.62]I couldn't even see what the hell we were attacking.
[319:09.32]Didn't even eat my mastery food either.
[319:10.90]Oh well.
[319:11.10]Alright, I see a boss up here.
[319:13.82]This is a new boss.
[319:22.21]New boss.
[319:25.53]Let's play the game Last Will.
[319:28.94]What is Last Will?
[319:33.84]Maiden of Virtue is the next boss.
[319:38.79]Looks like we have to clear the rest of this.
[319:44.43]Apparently.
[319:54.40]Ooh, I don't know what I'm standing in.
[319:55.56]Not much, I don't think.
[320:01.66]Virtuous Lady.
[320:20.61]Somebody's in love.
[320:21.31]What does that mean?
[320:29.20]Am I going to finish Fury?
[320:31.16]I completely forgot about that game.
[320:33.78]Thank you for reminding me.
[320:34.94]I'll take a look at it again.
[320:41.89]Although I'm going to have to like get... I'm going to stream Dark Souls 3 tomorrow.
[320:46.37]And I'm terrified because I'm not sure... Exactly what I'm in store for.
[320:52.54]Because I haven't played that game in months.
[320:56.56]So I'm going to have to really, really do a little bit of practice before I turn this stream on.
[321:03.32]But thank you, Danger Illustrated.
[321:05.19]Welcome, dude.
[321:06.43]Thank you for the sub.
[321:10.01]We didn't?
[321:10.49]Oh, we got it.
[321:13.01]How many more of those is what?
[321:14.23]Three?
[321:17.03]Alright.
[321:17.72]Maiden of Virtue.
[321:19.76]Dear, there looks like a lot of shit to have to deal with.
[321:23.66]main virtue will place patches of sacred ground underneath players which will slowly expand and inflict damage to other players who enter she will later cast mass repentance which places a stun on the entire group that breaks on damage taken okay so you want to like stand in that shit so this sacred ground
[321:50.84]You want to get hurt while she's casting Mass Repentance.
[321:54.90]Wait, what?
[321:57.58]Okie dokie.
[322:01.97]Hey, Twitchy Dove.
[322:02.69]Thanks for the eight months.
[322:03.59]Welcome back, man.
[322:06.87]Had to sub while you were live.
[322:07.87]Finally got you.
[322:08.41]Well, thanks, man.
[322:08.87]Appreciate it.
[322:09.93]Welcome to the family.
[322:12.90]Then we have to burn her shield so we can then interrupt her big attack.
[322:19.42]So we have to do like 5 million damage and then interrupt her huge move.
[322:26.38]Okay.
[322:28.22]Avoid standing near other players to minimize holy bolt chaining.
[322:30.94]So she chains holy bolts.
[322:34.05]Stand near a patch of sacred ground but don't go in it until she starts casting Mass Repentance.
[322:40.99]Okay.
[322:45.83]Okay.
[322:51.37]We're gonna need to get the destroy him sound back.
[322:57.42]Let's give it a try.
[322:58.20]So, don't stand in that shit.
[322:59.54]Only stand in it when she is about to cast that giant stun.
[323:04.71]And then... Let's just give it a try.
[323:06.57]Fuck it.
[323:10.65]Fuck it, right?
[323:11.07]Let's just do it.
[323:14.89]All shall be sanctified.
[323:17.10]The righteous have nothing to fear.
[323:24.37]Holy shock.
[323:30.87]Oh, there it is.
[323:31.37]Okay, that's the shit that's on the ground.
[323:32.65]So we avoid it.
[323:34.53]Kind of sprawls around the room.
[323:38.09]Alright.
[323:38.79]Oh, she's casting Sacred Ground at me.
[323:40.81]I got it.
[323:41.07]Okay.
[323:43.63]Got it.
[323:44.43]Well, I'm not in a great spot.
[323:46.82]Not in the best of spots right now.
[323:51.28]Somebody's dead.
[323:53.50]Mass Repentance.
[323:54.02]Okay, here we go.
[323:55.96]And... Get in!
[323:57.67]What?
[323:59.19]Oh.
[324:00.27]I thought I missed it somehow.
[324:01.79]Whoa!
[324:03.73]Ah, I'm dead.
[324:04.51]I'm not sure what happened.
[324:13.16]I was... What?
[324:16.62]Hold on.
[324:21.01]Oh, damn.
[324:21.85]Okay.
[324:23.55]Because I was wondering.
[324:24.95]I died out here.
[324:25.73]I wasn't even standing in it.
[324:28.61]We got to watch out for the pizza.
[324:34.35]16 seconds to play.
[324:35.13]So I think it's just like a heal check.
[324:37.24]I think.
[324:39.40]Can that be like cleansed or anything?
[324:45.84]So you really want to just get in there and get out.
[324:47.48]And then I guess maybe I'll just ice block it.
[324:56.39]Because that stayed on me.
[324:58.03]I was way outside of that thing when I died.
[325:07.35]Yeah, the dot will stack.
[325:11.34]So how do you get rid of the dot?
[325:17.08]Expanding pizza dough.
[325:19.88]Uh-oh, we got a pull here.
[325:22.38]Oh boy, and I have aggro.
[325:23.64]That's not good.
[325:30.17]Hey, Svane.
[325:32.31]Thanks for the sub, dude.
[325:33.33]Welcome.
[325:36.55]Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[325:50.82]Shit, get me out of that.
[325:51.84]I'm going to take this time to eat my mastery food.
[326:05.60]Somebody left?
[326:07.66]Oh.
[326:09.18]Does this guy have to go to the airport too?
[326:10.38]Is that what happened?
[326:14.10]Guys, I need to go.
[326:14.70]I have to get to the airport.
[326:28.07]I mean, I can just ice block it.
[326:29.23]I can stand in it, get it, and then ice block.
[326:31.72]And then, wouldn't that be... help the healer a little?
[326:36.20]I assume.
[326:43.98]We gotta find another person.
[326:46.72]Ooh!
[326:47.94]When is it gonna be sorcery?
[326:48.86]Uh... You know what?
[326:52.65]I'll probably do sorcery on Thursday.
[326:54.75]And then we'll do Mafia again on Friday.
[327:01.77]I think there's like six bosses left after this.
[327:09.75]Something like that.
[327:13.29]Was there eight or nine bosses in the whole dungeon?
[327:20.97]And let me make sure.
[327:21.69]Am I going the right way?
[327:25.53]No.
[327:28.45]No.
[327:31.31]Here comes this guy.
[327:33.12]This guy's already inside.
[327:39.17]No, maybe I was going the right way.
[327:40.51]Did it go down and around?
[327:46.03]I'm lost already.
[327:46.95]Yeah, it's down that way, isn't it?
[327:51.43]Can I just go invisible and walk by all these guys?
[328:05.10]I'm lost.
[328:05.86]LOL.
[328:06.04]Okay.
[328:11.58]I just started, like, walking in a random direction.
[328:17.44]I need to go that way.
[328:28.37]It's almost 7, but you can't get a Tinder date?
[328:34.11]I don't have a Tinder date tonight.
[328:35.60]You guys are my date tonight.
[328:39.44]Use your map.
[328:39.90]Yeah, that's what I figured, because...
[328:42.78]but the map um you have to wrap all the way around you can see like all the way down here around here I like I don't know I'm gonna follow all these people this place is very big and very confusing yeah okay now I remember there's a little area
[329:07.71]Hey, Tubby Momo.
[329:09.01]Thank you for six months.
[329:09.84]Welcome back.
[329:11.40]Use your map.
[329:12.74]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[329:23.80]Was it me?
[329:24.66]It wasn't me, right?
[329:25.68]Okay, it wasn't me.
[329:26.38]It wasn't me.
[329:28.18]I was going to say there's no way that was me.
[329:30.30]But now it is going to be me because now I have aggro too.
[329:40.10]I can't heal this guy either.
[329:40.94]I'm gonna have to go invisible.
[329:41.86]I had a mana.
[330:01.24]I'm just spamming move.
[330:06.58]Spamming move.
[330:13.56]Alright.
[330:16.17]Then we go up.
[330:19.91]And around.
[330:24.01]Why does it look like you're keyboard turning?
[330:25.87]I don't know.
[330:30.19]I pretty much hold down right mouse button at all times.
[330:39.58]Sometimes if I'm too lazy to hold down right mouse button, I'll
[330:43.89]Maybe do it.
[330:44.74]I fucking pulled.
[330:45.54]No, I didn't.
[330:46.96]Fucking suck my asshole.
[330:54.54]Invisibility saves the day.
[331:04.65]Good raider.
[331:08.39]Alright, so let me get this right.
[331:16.08]She cast the big thing on the ground.
[331:18.82]Don't drop the holy ground in the middle of everybody.
[331:26.77]What's everybody's problem with clicking?
[331:29.31]As long as it's not like my rotation and it's only moves I do like once every like three hours.
[331:34.35]Is it really that big of a deal?
[331:35.35]Like greater invisibility?
[331:37.41]I think I've been streaming for five and a half hours.
[331:39.51]I think I've clicked this maybe three times.
[331:44.91]Ain't a big deal.
[331:57.07]Yeah, you don't want to be next to each other because of the chains.
[331:58.71]That was pretty far away.
[331:59.79]And jump in the crap when she does Mass Repentance.
[332:01.89]We did that.
[332:03.19]And we all died anyways.
[332:07.52]Yeah, but that's not like a rotation.
[332:11.16]That's not like a boss rotation.
[332:13.26]I'm thinking a boss rotation.
[332:17.44]No arcane charges.
[332:18.31]This is not good.
[332:21.91]We want to spread the fuck out here, man.
[332:28.03]Holy bolt.
[332:40.43]Here comes the shit.
[332:42.13]Alright, I interrupted her holy shock.
[332:44.99]She's kind of just standing there.
[332:45.81]I think she's doing it too.
[332:51.13]Oh, that guy.
[332:58.99]Alright, here comes the mass repentance.
[333:03.61]Oh, that hurts.
[333:05.17]That really fucking hurts.
[333:07.17]Really badly.
[333:12.23]That hurts a shitload.
[333:15.99]I'm the only one alive.
[333:20.76]Okay, so you... It's like you gotta wait for the last possible second.
[333:26.72]right when like it's about to go off you like touch it and then get up because that thing is you gotta be ready right when you get stunned because that does a fucking shitload of damage you got to get out before the stun what do you have like a second or so to get out
[333:59.37]So you just have to touch it and then run.
[334:01.15]But what if she... Okay, right, right, right.
[334:03.69]I got it.
[334:07.66]Because it lasts for... It's a 16 second debuff.
[334:13.20]I got it.
[334:14.25]Yep, makes sense.
[334:15.51]I'm going to relay that.
[334:35.03]That's good info.
[334:45.44]Fuck, did I just get lost again?
[334:46.58]No.
[334:53.69]Before... Before you get in trouble.
[334:57.31]Slow typer, fast clicker.
[335:21.26]Lost again.
[335:22.02]No, not this time.
[335:26.40]This is a very long run, though.
[335:27.56]I hope we're not missing a shortcut.
[335:44.73]Chat seems drunk today.
[335:45.97]Hmm.
[335:52.63]I mean, I'm definitely on like tilt today.
[335:54.63]This is the second boss.
[335:59.45]Long walk.
[336:00.61]We'll get it this time, I think.
[336:01.65]Now knowing that you just have to touch it and then get the hell out.
[336:10.38]I was under the impression that when she cast the move, you have to be like inside the debuff.
[336:15.70]I didn't know that the actual debuff would make it so you don't get stunned.
[336:23.06]So that'll be easier now.
[336:25.94]Because once she starts to cast it, just go like this.
[336:28.58]Okay, the green carpet is the shit.
[336:30.86]Boop.
[336:31.60]Just get up.
[336:32.42]And yeah, you'll get stunned, but it's not going to keep you stunned.
[336:37.94]From my understanding, right?
[336:39.03]Let me just make sure I'm not insane.
[336:52.14]And so begins your purification.
[336:54.84]Yep.
[336:55.48]I'm gonna go over this way.
[336:56.22]I'm gonna get away from this mage.
[337:00.82]All shall be sanctified.
[337:03.11]Step into the light, mortals.
[337:05.21]Who's she doing it to?
[337:07.91]By fire, be cleansed.
[337:12.15]Okie dokie.
[337:13.73]She's doing it to me.
[337:22.03]So far, so good.
[337:23.99]Alright, she's doing to me.
[337:31.56]I'm sticking it over here.
[337:36.30]I have the debuff right now.
[337:37.46]If she starts doing it, I ain't gonna move.
[337:39.32]Yeah, I'm not gonna go into anything.
[337:40.46]Right, okay.
[337:40.74]I'm still getting fucking hurt, though.
[337:50.88]I'm going to let the healer get a little bit of a break here so I can... Whoa!
[337:59.40]Whoa!
[338:01.46]What happened there?
[338:07.00]What happened there?
[338:08.76]I got fucking two and a half million?
[338:11.88]Hold on a second.
[338:15.65]Okay, so that has to come down.
[338:17.61]Fuck.
[338:19.59]I was going to die.
[338:20.05]If I didn't ice block, I was dead.
[338:21.32]Step into the light, mortals.
[338:30.32]Shit.
[338:31.66]By fire, be cleansed.
[338:34.02]So, what happened there is because... How come nobody else died then?
[338:37.76]Just me and this guy?
[338:40.24]Hold, mortal.
[338:41.19]A teachable moment.
[338:43.27]Not be an ice block?
[338:45.31]Renounce your greed and perversion.
[338:51.34]Here we go again.
[338:57.18]Don't use the... What?
[338:58.12]Because I was in the ice block, it killed me?
[339:06.18]You line of sight her.
[339:07.46]Oh, God.
[339:13.86]You gotta line of sight that move, apparently.
[339:25.57]She holy wrathed and drew Bolton Giant.
[339:35.91]Yeah, I thought I was under the assumption that we had to counterspell it or like interrupt it or something, but I guess I wasn't available to do that.
[339:44.55]The thing is, if I didn't ice block there, though, I was going to die.
[339:48.11]I was at like 3% health after stepping into the thing and getting incapacitated outside of it.
[339:55.40]So I kind of had to.
[340:00.32]I had to.
[340:09.10]I like this, though.
[340:09.68]I like needing to learn new bosses.
[340:12.34]It's been very catatonic lately just because doing all the... How did that guy get on a mount?
[340:17.77]What?
[340:18.91]Oh.
[340:19.67]He's paladin.
[340:26.61]The big bad wolf.
[340:37.80]The real issue is when you get the debuff, you take 300,000 damage every two seconds.
[340:44.96]There's not much you can do about that, and it lasts for 16 seconds.
[340:47.33]Jeez.
[340:51.87]Pretty much everybody is taking 300,000 damage every two seconds.
[340:55.80]This is like a hell fight for healers.
[341:05.39]Don't get stuck on shit.
[341:10.59]200 BC.
[341:14.09]What happened to YouTube videos?
[341:15.25]Go to my second channel.
[341:18.00]While I work on big stuff on the main one.
[341:29.81]Alright.
[341:30.33]So these pillars, you line us.
[341:32.30]That is a line of sight.
[341:34.18]Looks like you can see right through them.
[341:46.05]What's going up tomorrow?
[341:47.51]The BattleBots video that me and Star played like a month or two ago.
[341:52.49]BattleBots stream.
[341:53.43]It's going up there tomorrow.
[341:55.73]And then another day or two later, another Dark Souls 3 video.
[342:03.38]Actually, I'm going to change this from Burp and Booger Party to something else.
[342:05.72]Alright.
[342:17.19]How about Karazhan 7.1.
[342:20.63]New, new, new.
[342:24.23]Karazhan 7.1.
[342:25.15]New, new, new.
[342:26.73]Is the new stream title.
[342:33.07]Alrighty, so let me get this straight again.
[342:46.40]Incapacitates all plays for 30 seconds or until they take damage.
[342:48.64]After casting Mass Repentance, the Maiden of Ritual casts Holy Bulwark and then repeatedly casts Holy Wrath until Holy Bulwark is removed.
[342:58.81]So she keeps casting Holy Wrath over and over again.
[343:07.76]Oh, okay.
[343:12.63]Inflicts 2.4 and increases all damage taken by 100% for the remainder of the encounter.
[343:20.19]This encounter stacks.
[343:31.98]She can't be interrupted.
[343:33.45]This can be interrupted, though, can it?
[343:39.48]Fuck, we're going.
[343:44.71]We are just going.
[343:49.31]So line of sight that ship.
[343:52.53]Sticking it right over here.
[344:02.16]Just taking ticks of damage here.
[344:06.84]Can't even...
[344:13.90]Oh boy, I'm taking lots of damage.
[344:25.52]I thought she was going to do that.
[344:26.22]I thought she was doing it.
[344:27.16]Oh my god.
[344:28.20]I just did that to get the heal.
[344:34.49]Oh, fuck me!
[344:35.47]No!
[344:37.02]Ah!
[344:37.46]It removes all the debuffs.
[344:39.08]I'm dead.
[344:41.14]Ah!
[344:41.66]Quick, get out of it!
[344:42.62]Get out of it!
[344:47.51]Ah, fuck.
[344:48.13]The lesson is complete.
[345:05.01]I completely forgot that it removes all the debuffs.
[345:09.51]Son of a bitch.
[345:24.54]I love how this would be going so much more smoothly if we could just be in direct communication with each other.
[345:31.85]Again, this is one of the reasons why I wanted to do this with like four friends, but you saw how that fucking turned out.
[345:46.33]Why do I have the under-resourced character thing turned off?
[345:51.15]Because, I don't know, it gets in the way for me.
[346:03.24]I'm not just talking about you, Etalyx.
[346:07.66]I'm talking about specifically the guy that did this with me all day and then decided he was gonna leave.
[346:12.58]When we fight the first fucking boss.
[346:17.69]And the other guy got like sick so he couldn't come.
[346:37.32]You can't line aside it.
[346:39.53]You just gotta get rid of it.
[346:40.57]It's just like a shield you get rid of.
[346:41.57]Then you have to interrupt the cast, I think.
[346:43.41]What's going on?
[346:55.97]What are we talking about?
[346:59.85]First guy eats his buggers.
[347:03.13]Oh shit, I'm going the wrong way.
[347:06.41]What did I miss?
[347:06.89]Boys?
[347:07.19]There better have been no progress and plenty of dying.
[347:08.99]Oh, there's definitely been plenty of dying.
[347:15.26]There has been lots of that.
[347:24.54]Linus sighted.
[347:26.12]Just like killed two people.
[347:37.53]so I just if you get it it's gonna the healer just has to heal you and you can't use personal cooldowns the healer just has to do it because typically like like ice block I would use ice block he's not even doing the noise what noise I've made like a lot of weird noises probably this stream
[348:07.42]So I just have to fight the urge to use a personal cooldown when I have, like, 5% health, apparently.
[348:14.24]Besides, uh, like, just fucking ice barrier.
[348:16.86]It's the only thing I can use.
[348:17.66]Well, like this?
[348:28.97]Like, eh!
[348:29.89]That's a noise.
[348:30.33]I did a noise.
[348:41.63]Remember, this used to be a noise stream.
[348:44.09]It still is.
[348:44.55]Yeah, this has to be interrupted.
[349:02.99]So I guess save all the cooldowns, like all your damage cooldowns, when she has the Bulwark on.
[349:12.15]I'm going to do that.
[349:13.11]And this time, I'm not going to use any of my fucking cooldowns.
[349:16.89]Any of my ice block or anything.
[349:19.85]I'm just going to have to die from the dot if I don't get healed.
[349:22.84]That's just how it's going to work.
[349:29.84]That's not the noise?
[349:35.14]Don't tell me.
[349:35.88]Tell them that.
[349:40.54]Dude, just meet your friends at the door.
[349:41.70]I'm going to be broken here.
[350:09.59]Streamer noise?
[350:20.18]Alright.
[350:21.34]This is where she dies.
[350:22.12]Let's get her.
[350:26.25]Let's kill the maiden.
[350:31.09]The correct noise.
[350:31.69]I don't even know what noise you're talking about.
[350:33.19]There's like a hundred different noises.
[350:41.07]You thank someone for a Bitcoin donation?
[350:43.11]Okay, that just scared the fuck out of me.
[350:45.29]I thought we pulled.
[350:45.87]I just heard a scream.
[350:51.62]And I gotta pee again, too.
[351:01.46]I have to pee.
[351:05.96]Just spam click.
[351:10.70]Is this guy here?
[351:11.44]Yeah, he's here.
[351:15.42]Clear this.
[351:22.19]Do the beep noise?
[351:23.23]What is a beep noise?
[351:27.17]No, I'm going to do the let's kill the maiden of virtue noise.
[351:43.79]Yeah, so you really just, you want to get that dot on you right before she starts to do that cast.
[351:53.89]But if you already have it on you from being targeted with the circle, you kind of double screw.
[351:58.67]That's what happened to me last time.
[352:00.39]I had the debuff on me, and that... What the fuck?
[352:06.81]I thought that just said Skeletal Loser.
[352:10.87]Watch out, we pulled a Skeletal Loser.
[352:15.34]Actually, that's good.
[352:15.84]That means I get my charges.
[352:20.85]I'll have four arcane charges.
[352:21.89]Cool.
[352:22.27]Good.
[352:23.83]And two procs of arcane missiles.
[352:27.03]Only one stack, though.
[352:29.19]You have to go back inside of it because the debuff ran out.
[352:31.72]It does like three and a half million damage.
[352:35.98]300,000 every two seconds, right?
[352:45.77]Let's go.
[352:47.01]Let's try it again.
[352:47.78]I'm holding on to my cooldowns.
[352:53.30]I'm not going to use them until after the first explosion there.
[352:55.82]There's the first one.
[352:59.80]Holy shock.
[353:01.18]Holy bolt to me.
[353:19.83]Okay, I'm going to put it back here.
[353:28.41]So it's going to be on me.
[353:31.29]Wait, I don't even have it.
[353:34.28]I guess I just don't even have it on me.
[353:35.98]Okay, well that's good to know.
[353:38.52]And... Fuck.
[353:42.26]I'm good, I'm good.
[353:44.70]You really got to get this Holy Wrath off.
[353:47.84]Holy shit, are you serious?
[353:50.42]I'm gonna die!
[353:51.84]I'm dead.
[353:59.30]I couldn't use any cooldowns, either.
[354:09.42]Now, am I, like, too far away from the healer?
[354:11.55]Or am I, like, breaking line of sight from him?
[354:22.60]They still might, I don't know, it depends.
[354:26.18]Oh, here it comes.
[354:28.19]No healers in it.
[354:29.41]Healers, they're all dead.
[354:51.10]Get closer?
[354:51.54]Well, if you get closer, then the holy shock spreads to people.
[355:02.62]So what else?
[355:03.72]If I can't use ice block, I mean... Am I going to have to get, like, first aid?
[355:08.12]Because I can't use ice block there.
[355:17.59]Oh, yeah, I need to repair.
[355:19.01]Actually, no, not yet.
[355:28.57]Step into the light, mortals.
[355:31.49]Yeah, nothing's broken yet.
[355:33.49]After the next pull, though, it will be for sure.
[355:45.70]So what did I do wrong there?
[355:46.74]Right when she casted it, I walked in and walked right out, and I had... Ugh.
[356:06.86]You have to ice block right after the repentance to clear the dot, then pile on the DPS.
[356:14.55]I guess so.
[356:15.29]Yeah, so after she does the big explosion.
[356:24.01]He didn't do the noise.
[356:27.21]He got stunned in the goo.
[356:28.44]I guess I'm just terrified to go into that goo too quickly because we're all going to be taking so much damage.
[356:51.61]I know.
[356:51.83]I had two stacks, I know.
[356:52.59]Well, it's because I got stunned in the second one.
[356:57.39]I'll just blink out of it.
[356:58.53]I'll just get in and blink out.
[357:13.08]I need, like, DBM or something.
[357:14.46]Just because I don't know when she's going to cast that move.
[357:19.69]It's like a good enough time, I guess, next time to get DBM.
[357:34.93]Oh, that was action camera.
[357:36.13]Athage.
[357:37.23]You do slash console space action cam.
[357:40.01]A and C are both capitalized.
[357:41.77]Space on.
[357:43.43]And it'll turn it on.
[357:46.28]Yeah, I'm just having trouble with knowing when she's going to do that move.
[357:52.24]And when I should stand in that shit.
[357:54.62]Because it just pops up on me out of nowhere.
[358:07.81]So you want to have it on you.
[358:09.39]One stack of it when she does that move.
[358:12.21]And then it clears it.
[358:13.95]And then you've got to burn the hell out of her shield.
[358:18.12]I just, like, burped and died at the same time.
[358:19.94]Did you hear that huge, like, internal burp?
[358:28.80]No, that's not what you want to do.
[358:30.98]Because isn't that what I just did?
[358:32.24]When she cast Mass Repentance, bump into the ground near the end of the castle, the damage un-stuns you.
[358:35.86]But yeah, but it stuns you, like, inside the goo.
[358:39.04]That's exactly what I did last time when it got me killed.
[358:43.26]That was the noise?
[358:45.36]No, it wasn't.
[359:05.17]kill that damn shield.
[359:06.27]Alright, let's go.
[359:07.97]Let's give it a try.
[359:14.03]How long does the instance take?
[359:15.19]I mean, this is just a random group of people.
[359:20.11]So I don't know.
[359:21.85]I'm gonna assume I'm gonna assume if you don't do it with a random five people, it won't be this long.
[359:29.38]But it is brand new content.
[359:42.73]By fire be purged.
[359:52.14]Kill the maiden for the noise?
[360:05.22]We'll see what time it is after this boss is dead because I do need to eat food.
[360:11.10]And I've been going for like six or seven hours now.
[360:25.53]It's time to get hungry.
[360:29.95]So what you should be doing is getting the dot before the cast finishes.
[360:33.07]Yeah, you want to have it so you have the dot.
[360:36.11]So you're not close enough to when the goo is spreading.
[360:39.11]Because you're going to get stunned in it.
[360:41.71]Whatever, we'll try it again.
[360:45.75]Let's try it again.
[360:46.53]All shall be sanctified.
[360:52.72]Step into the light, mortals.
[360:59.71]See, it's right next to me to the left.
[361:01.07]Okay.
[361:02.50]So that's the one I'm going to use.
[361:10.44]So I should probably get it here soon.
[361:19.49]She's doing it again.
[361:26.86]Can't interrupt that.
[361:28.22]Good.
[361:32.91]Okay, so now... Okay, I did it.
[361:37.72]Good.
[361:39.10]Now I gotta get this fucking shield off.
[361:45.06]Oh, get that shield off!
[361:47.76]Okay, fine.
[361:48.48]We got it, we got it, we got it.
[361:49.26]Alright, do it again.
[361:51.84]Do it like two or three more times.
[361:53.60]Ooh, healer's dead.
[361:55.44]Healer's dead!
[361:58.72]We got a dead healer.
[362:00.26]That's a wipe!
[362:03.35]That's a wipe and a half.
[362:07.23]How are we still alive?
[362:17.42]I'm not sure how the hell we're still doing this, to be honest.
[362:21.44]Do we have like a battle res?
[362:24.78]Oh, I'm stuck here.
[362:25.20]Yeah.
[362:32.75]So I can just do that.
[362:38.10]We actually came pretty close this time.
[363:04.24]I'm not getting... I'm getting such shit arcane missiles right now.
[363:07.32]This is embarrassing.
[363:15.25]Oh my god.
[363:16.89]Finally.
[363:17.49]Jesus.
[363:18.01]Took long enough.
[363:24.46]I mean, we came pretty damn close.
[363:35.39]No, I'm dead.
[363:38.01]Wow!
[363:39.11]I actually had it.
[363:39.73]I actually might do this.
[363:44.97]No, I'm out of mana.
[363:53.36]I have to advocate.
[363:59.41]Bye!
[364:01.45]I think we got it, though.
[364:08.34]Just kill me.
[364:13.56]Such an awkward fight.
[364:19.29]Could have counter-spelled it.
[364:20.45]I think at that point it was too late.
[364:21.51]It was only three people alive.
[364:22.59]Yeah, we didn't have a healer like that whole time.
[364:29.95]No, I need to repair.
[364:43.84]Can he mount up outside?
[364:44.88]It's down here, I think, right?
[364:57.22]The master's terrace.
[365:06.56]My ult.
[365:06.96]I should use my ultimate attack.
[365:10.70]You've chosen stand up and die.
[365:12.27]Okay.
[365:14.97]Sell, sell, sell.
[365:17.47]Well, I can't.
[365:19.03]Actually, I don't want to sell that.
[365:30.21]Thanks.
[365:30.55]Never trust a purple.
[365:34.57]Yeah, I think after she dies, I'm probably going to get something to eat.
[365:37.59]Depends on how close the next boss is.
[365:42.69]It depends...
[365:54.67]Have I ever tried Final Fantasy XIV?
[365:57.10]Nope.
[365:58.48]I have not.
[366:01.84]Is it good?
[366:14.83]Will I come back?
[366:16.05]I don't know.
[366:16.67]Maybe.
[366:16.93]Maybe.
[366:22.36]choose to end the stream when it's supposed to start well because this the patch came out alright here's the thing I did not expect this patch was going to come out at this patch was supposed to go live at like two or three o'clock in the afternoon eastern so I thought like oh maybe I'll turn my stream on and like I'll stream like the patch and like we'll play karazhan and blah blah whatever right I was like at least two or three hours earlier than I thought I was going to be
[366:55.13]Very Final Fantasy.
[366:56.73]If you have experience with it.
[366:59.06]Maybe I'll give it a go.
[367:04.30]Show talents.
[367:10.20]I do not use rune of power.
[367:13.84]Because I don't like needing to stand still.
[367:16.02]Especially when you're learning new fights.
[367:19.00]Where standing still is sort of hard to do.
[367:21.93]I just don't like standing still anyways.
[367:23.17]I hate standing still.
[367:24.25]Don't ever stand still.
[367:30.30]And here's my eye level.
[367:32.68]Here's my stats.
[367:36.74]Oh, where am I going?
[367:46.45]Oh, shit.
[367:46.97]No, it's over here.
[367:51.50]This is the place of funk and magical phenomenon.
[367:58.75]Anything goes when you wipe in carries.
[368:03.41]Oh, shit.
[368:03.97]Somebody left the guild.
[368:04.73]This is Mafia three.
[368:21.80]Hello, ordinary.
[368:24.04]How are ya?
[368:25.10]Good to see ya.
[368:25.76]Alright, let's do it again.
[368:32.17]The stench of corruption is upon you.
[368:41.63]The funk of 40,000 years.
[368:43.01]All shall be sanctified.
[368:47.89]Step into the light, mortal.
[368:57.67]Okay, it's behind me.
[369:03.50]She's going to do it here in a second.
[369:09.88]Interrupt her.
[369:10.74]Here it comes.
[369:16.03]No, not now.
[369:16.89]It's going to be after this one.
[369:28.07]Okay, here we go.
[369:33.07]Got it.
[369:34.59]Killer!
[369:37.38]Get that fucking shield off!
[369:39.84]It's off.
[369:43.68]Give it up.
[369:45.50]Oh, boy.
[369:46.98]Oh, boy.
[369:47.36]You gotta put that away from us.
[369:55.58]You know what?
[369:55.86]Fuck it.
[369:56.08]Let's go.
[369:57.06]Time warp us.
[370:01.62]Get the fucking time warp.
[370:04.58]We're gonna kill her.
[370:05.34]It'll happen.
[370:08.38]I gotta go into conserve phase.
[370:11.06]I gotta go into conserve phase way too late here.
[370:18.78]Here it comes.
[370:22.50]There it is.
[370:24.36]And get it.
[370:28.40]I'm taking damage here.
[370:30.18]I'm taking a lot of fucking damage.
[370:33.94]I'm out of fucking mana too.
[370:37.94]Oh lord.
[370:38.90]I need to regen.
[370:54.69]God, this is taking over the whole arena.
[370:58.29]Oh, my God.
[370:59.17]Oh, she's so close.
[371:09.79]Ooh.
[371:14.62]We're all so close to each other.
[371:16.24]Are we going to get it off?
[371:21.44]I'm ice blocking.
[371:22.02]I don't think we can.
[371:24.87]Alright, we're good.
[371:25.49]Kill her.
[371:27.35]Kill her!
[371:29.26]Kill her!
[371:29.66]Oh, it's everywhere!
[371:34.74]Jesus.
[371:38.12]Oh my god.
[371:38.92]That was all over the place.
[371:45.69]Nothing.
[371:46.19]Damn it.
[371:53.80]Whoa.
[371:54.44]Cutscene.
[371:54.88]We got a cutscene!
[371:59.20]World first.
[371:59.76]Game sucks.
[372:02.73]Thanks a lot, Moose and Mills.
[372:05.19]Welcome back.
[372:25.34]Who is that supposed to be?
[372:26.12]Is that Arthas?
[372:28.46]Oh my god, it's Prince Arthas.
[372:30.51]Another year of slumber.
[372:33.13]I wonder if Medivh will ever awaken.
[372:38.49]It's Medivh!
[372:42.58]Ice coffee activated.
[372:43.62]It's spilling everywhere!
[372:55.63]Damn, 855 relic.
[372:57.49]Holy shit.
[373:04.79]Could have done better at DPS there, but... I'm also still trying to get used to the changes they did to the mana.
[373:14.48]My moves cost 100% more mana when I'm at four charges, and it's getting hard to manage it.
[373:20.08]I'm going to have to dump charges sooner than I wanted to.
[373:25.40]Oh, two down, six more bosses to go.
[373:27.12]Uh, I have to, like, pee.
[373:33.07]How do I, like, tell these guys I have to pee?
[373:38.73]Alright, before we pull the next boss, I'm gonna tell them I have to pee.
[373:43.11]So then they have to, like, stop and read the encounter.
[373:45.26]And then they can, like, tell me how to do it when I get back.
[373:56.54]Just Mafia III punch him?
[374:00.14]I could.
[374:03.52]But will I?
[374:04.28]No.
[374:10.03]Can't see.
[374:12.43]How can I still can't see?
[374:13.73]What the fuck?
[374:15.61]Okay, apparently I couldn't target anybody in here.
[374:18.32]Sweet.
[374:25.16]This hallway sucks.
[374:35.45]I hate these little choke points.
[374:37.55]The area just fills up with them and you can't even see what the hell is going on.
[374:45.38]Are we just fighting him in here?
[374:46.32]Is this safe?
[374:48.56]I feel like this isn't safe.
[374:53.51]This room is bright as hell.
[374:57.94]See, I told you it wasn't safe.
[374:59.98]I knew it wasn't going to be safe.
[375:06.30]But I think we're okay.
[375:11.12]Oh boy, we're just still falling.
[375:16.82]I'm out of fucking mana.
[375:22.55]Where are they going?
[375:24.01]What the fuck is happening in my life?
[375:28.13]What's going on?
[375:28.77]Like, what happened?
[375:29.53]What happened?
[375:32.29]I don't know.
[375:32.69]I'm not sure.
[375:38.53]These guys are, like, all casting moves from across the room.
[375:42.37]Oh, boy.
[375:43.75]What a shit show.
[375:47.31]And I need to drink, too, and I can't.
[375:49.01]Eh.
[375:52.22]Oh, fuck it.
[375:52.98]I'm just evocating.
[375:53.72]I don't have any time anyways.
[375:55.86]Apparently we do have time.
[376:05.69]I guess we had lots of time.
[376:08.75]Going the other way, I think?
[376:09.75]Yeah.
[376:13.09]I'm not pulling that shit.
[376:16.65]We're in combat, somehow.
[376:19.35]Still pushing.
[376:22.57]Moros or... We'll do Moros.
[376:25.21]I guess this is the way we're doing.
[376:27.06]This is the way we're going.
[376:38.06]I pulled all the extra mobs.
[376:39.56]No, I didn't.
[376:40.22]The paladin was like throwing shields at them.
[376:42.83]Don't blame me for something I didn't do.
[376:55.81]I pulled maybe one group.
[376:57.47]I will take blame for that.
[376:58.67]And I still can't drink.
[377:00.29]God damn it.
[377:05.09]Boy, I didn't pull those.
[377:06.23]I didn't do it.
[377:07.15]Trust me.
[377:09.45]But I will do DPS.
[377:13.27]And then be out of mana.
[377:28.80]I remember this room back in the old raid.
[377:42.69]Moros.
[377:44.15]Good old Moros.
[377:45.88]He's a great guy.
[377:47.30]Check out his YouTube channel.
[377:48.30]YouTube.com slash MorosHD.
[377:57.46]Not a mana, and I don't want to evocate.
[377:59.28]Sorry, ain't happening.
[378:00.90]Not like right before we pulled Moros.
[378:04.15]Oh, I'm supposed to tell these guys I have to pee.
[378:12.80]Just Leroy the whole room.
[378:14.04]I feel like I'd get kicked out of the dungeon if I did that right now.
[378:19.58]Look at how useful I'm being.
[378:25.16]I'm being so useful.
[378:26.26]Please!
[378:27.30]Why are we still in combat?
[378:30.90]Why?
[378:31.38]We're not.
[378:32.64]I swear, Blizzard, we're not.
[378:34.68]Oh my god.
[378:35.44]Oh, they're all dead.
[378:44.35]What the hell is talking?
[378:46.31]Ew.
[378:58.15]Why are we still in combat?
[379:01.01]What the fuck are we in combat with?
[379:02.73]Bleh.
[379:10.48]Hey, Razzle1042.
[379:11.72]Thanks a lot, man.
[379:12.92]Just invis.
[379:13.62]I don't think it'll work if you're in a dungeon.
[379:16.08]If somebody has aggro or something.
[379:26.55]What if I need to go invisible when Moro's coming?
[379:32.03]Alright, let's see.
[379:33.13]Not in combat.
[379:33.73]Okay.
[379:36.41]Still in combat.
[379:39.50]Still in combat.
[379:40.58]Invisible.
[379:44.20]Something happened where I could get out.
[379:46.06]Ghost trap.
[379:46.80]The ghostbusters were in here.
[379:47.62]What the hell does this do?
[380:22.08]Alright, I'll be right back, I just gotta pee.
[380:23.42]See you in a second.
[380:32.55]No, not five minutes, hold on a second.
[380:34.89]Not five minutes.
[382:14.67]Alright, I'm back.
[382:28.44]Alright, what's going on?
[382:38.34]How does Moros work?
[382:43.28]Alright, Moros... Kill additional dinner guests before Moros uses Ghastly Purge to make them immune to stuns and pawns?
[382:55.95]Use the Ghost Trap on Moros' dinner guests, so... As the fight progresses, Moros uses Garo to continuously spread damage across the party.
[383:05.27]He casts Ghostly Purge at 60% health, making all his dinner guests immune to crowd control.
[383:12.08]Okay.
[383:16.45]So the trap you throw it... Hold on, let me read what this guy said.
[383:22.11]Use the traps to CC his guests up there.
[383:25.58]We kill his friends while cleaving on him.
[383:29.26]We got to get all those buddies dead before we burn them.
[383:32.00]They all increase up the damage, so we got to do it in a time-ish.
[383:36.26]Who wants them?
[383:38.55]Hmm.
[383:41.72]I love how nobody has responded to that.
[383:43.50]I'm back.
[383:45.04]I like pissed all over the place to get back as fast as I can.
[383:50.37]Can we polymorph one?
[383:54.95]So I guess who dies first?
[383:57.53]Kill the chick.
[383:59.67]Oh, isn't there more than one chick here?
[384:03.95]Somebody's dead.
[384:05.05]Tank's dead.
[384:06.33]Oh boy, wipe it up.
[384:07.55]Wipe it up, boys.
[384:10.99]Thanks, Ted.
[384:15.95]Shit, shit, shit, shit.
[384:18.41]They think you're a weirdo?
[384:23.58]Might as well go full weirdo then.
[384:32.36]Yeah, that failed real hard.
[384:40.32]My bad.
[384:40.72]What did he do?
[384:41.40]What happened there?
[384:44.32]Looks like they died pretty quickly, though.
[384:49.24]Oh, he didn't realize that it pulled them.
[384:59.55]Oh, did somebody drink a little too much coffee this afternoon?
[385:04.61]Oh, there's the noise.
[385:08.93]He did it.
[385:10.46]He did the noise.
[385:11.18]Hey, come on.
[385:23.77]Give me a break.
[385:24.69]I've been streaming for like seven hours and I only burped like three times in seven hours.
[385:39.73]Shit, what am I doing?
[385:47.25]There, I did it again.
[385:47.91]Bet you didn't see that coming.
[385:54.08]Shit, I'm gonna get lost.
[385:55.08]No, I'm not.
[386:03.70]I should just turn on that and just burp right into the fucking camera.
[386:19.53]ignores Yeah, DBM count these guys are talking about DBM see they do a DBM countdown.
[386:26.90]I don't have that Auto cam auto is upstairs eating.
[386:37.18]I don't think he's he's around to be on camera oh Shoot oh shoot oh
[386:49.85]Actually, I don't even need to do that move.
[387:02.05]Possibility of a Civilian 6 stream.
[387:04.01]I'm going to say no.
[387:08.63]There's like a 98% chance that I will not do a Civilization 6 stream.
[387:17.67]I can pretty much guarantee that.
[387:25.57]I know, I gotta get DBM.
[387:26.47]Well, all the add-ons all just stopped working, so I had to clear all of them.
[387:32.29]I didn't have DBM before, but it's an excuse to get all the rest of my other add-ons, because I just got Skada.
[387:37.10]That's the only one.
[387:42.04]Stables first.
[387:45.66]I guess we're not doing Moros first.
[387:47.02]We're gonna do the stables.
[387:47.74]I think a mount drops here.
[387:57.05]Well, at least we're going to clear it, apparently.
[388:01.77]So you're saying that there's a chance.
[388:09.73]Lots of horsies.
[388:12.19]Watch out for the horsies.
[388:13.27]Yeah, we're going to Alaneth this ship.
[388:26.03]I feel like I don't want to be near the charge when there's a line on the ground there.
[388:29.06]There's a couple on the ground right now.
[388:34.28]That's a funny horse noise.
[388:35.34]I always thought that sounded like Yoda.
[388:40.61]Or like Fozzie Bear.
[388:45.15]Oh no, here comes Fozzie Bear with bloodlust.
[388:48.53]I can't even do it.
[388:55.64]And click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
[389:01.00]Whatever, fuck AoE.
[389:06.09]Who gives a shit about AoE anyways?
[389:08.25]Not me.
[389:23.66]And there he goes.
[389:25.12]And I can't drink.
[389:32.20]Life sucks.
[389:33.20]Life sucks.
[389:34.18]I can't drink.
[389:35.18]Life sucks.
[389:35.84]I'm out of mana.
[389:39.74]And I'm not advocating.
[389:41.12]Not a chance in hell.
[389:42.73]Especially if you're like... Actually... Maybe I will.
[389:47.89]Yeah, fuck it.
[389:51.83]Dermapop quiz, does war change?
[389:53.78]No.
[389:54.72]Never changes.
[389:56.50]You should know this.
[389:57.10]You should know that, that war never changes.
[390:00.68]Ouch.
[390:03.56]Thank you for the 1500, dude.
[390:06.23]Much appreciated.
[390:08.09]Hope you're enjoying the stream.
[390:10.43]Baked flakes, thank you, man.
[390:11.81]That's $15,000. $15,000.
[390:24.28]These guys don't die.
[390:24.90]These guys are just annoying.
[390:34.32]They just run around.
[390:36.86]Oh, Jesus.
[390:39.44]Oh, God.
[390:42.66]By the way, I apologize in advance.
[390:45.45]That is the shittiest $100 noise.
[390:51.31]It's just a guy going, alright.
[390:55.62]Oh my god, dude.
[390:57.97]I did not expect that.
[390:59.49]Baked flakes with $115.
[391:02.11]Holy shit, dude.
[391:08.00]Thanks.
[391:08.48]That's very, very kind of you.
[391:11.32]Watching me fail over and over again in Karazhan with a group of random people.
[391:17.04]Because all my friends are gone.
[391:19.76]What's that song?
[391:20.94]All my friends are gone.
[391:21.92]All my friends are... Whatever it is.
[391:23.88]Doesn't Kermit the Frog sing a song like that?
[391:31.37]Oh, don't worry.
[391:31.99]So, the... I'm going to give you guys some tidbits.
[391:36.79]Speaking of bits.
[391:39.01]In a couple weeks, I'm going to have all custom sounds.
[391:42.87]And custom animations.
[391:44.96]So, I'll tell you what they are.
[391:46.72]Because I feel like you guys probably want to know.
[391:50.20]The 10,000 bit, if somebody donates 10,000 bits to this channel, there's gonna be a BS stampede.
[391:56.94]Where it takes up the whole screen.
[391:58.50]And, like, literally, like, a hundred fucking BS, like, cartoon, or, like, sprint stampede, BS stampede into the screen.
[392:04.20]5,000 is gonna be glue man, like, suplexes a guy into the screen and then punches through the, uh, 5,000 bit thing.
[392:20.90]Cause I want that to be like special, you know, not just a guy going... Alright!
[392:26.46]Which is what it is now.
[392:29.84]Uh, for a hundred it's gonna be the J, he's gonna come over and eat it.
[392:32.91]Eat whatever was donated.
[392:35.65]A thousand or more is gonna be a different version of that J kind of chomping through it.
[392:40.17]It's gonna be all kinds of cool ones.
[392:43.77]But yeah, the BS Stampede, the BF Heat is um... It's gonna be like fucking long and crazy.
[392:53.25]Because I definitely want that to be for the people that give that money.
[392:58.08]Not just a guy saying, oh, yeah.
[393:02.58]Keep the alright at the end.
[393:03.98]It's just like, oh, the BS Stampede.
[393:06.70]Alright.
[393:14.13]But, yeah.
[393:15.23]Thanks a lot, Baked Flakes.
[393:17.71]Like I said, I never expected to look over and see that somebody gave me more than $100.
[393:23.53]So what the hell do we do with this boss?
[393:29.42]Stack for shared suffering or you will bubble it.
[393:36.58]75 to 5.
[393:37.44]No, I said 100 gets the J comes over and chomps down on the bit.
[393:44.17]Anything more than 500, like another fucking J. It's going to be different for everything.
[393:51.58]There's going to be one for 100, 500, and 1,000.
[393:53.99]And there's also going to be crazy ones for 5,000 and 10,000.
[393:57.43]Is there a 50,000-bit donation?
[394:00.87]I hope not.
[394:05.02]For it Campbell, how much to donate to have the clown car drive in and explode?
[394:08.90]Alright, hold on.
[394:14.87]I got to pay attention to this.
[394:20.29]Ultimate is untargetable while riding Midnight.
[394:23.62]Mighty Stomp will interrupt all spellcasting.
[394:25.48]Okay, so you don't want to be casting.
[394:28.78]You will need to stand by your tank to help them survive shared suffering.
[394:33.48]So we all have to stand in the way.
[394:37.27]Okay.
[394:38.69]Gotta dispel the right guy, too.
[394:40.27]What the fuck are they talking about?
[394:49.88]But, you know, I think it's just baptism by fire here.
[394:57.80]And they're going to change, too.
[394:59.72]So, maybe after like a month or two of the same ones, I'll get some new ones.
[395:05.21]God, why am I burping every... It's this coffee.
[395:08.13]Whatever this coffee... I wasn't burping in the other coffee.
[395:14.43]I'm going to start Dark Souls tomorrow at 7 p.m.
[395:19.16]Or maybe I don't know, it depends.
[395:20.98]I'm not sure.
[395:28.69]We all get a debuff at the same time, you have to find the right one to dispel.
[395:38.51]Marty stopped intangible to cast some specter to haunt their enemies.
[395:42.91]To all players every two seconds until it is dispelled.
[395:45.07]Dispelling the wrong player will result in all players taking 500 to 600 and something thousand shadow damage.
[395:51.64]What?
[395:54.58]So we're going to find the right one to dispel?
[395:58.28]How do you know?
[396:03.41]Can't wait for Sorcery 4.
[396:04.41]Saving all my bits to send you messages during that.
[396:09.43]Yeah, that'll be fun.
[396:10.27]Sorcery 4 is...
[396:12.64]I'll do that on Thursday.
[396:15.72]I don't know.
[396:16.36]I might... It depends on how I feel tomorrow.
[396:18.85]I might just... Dark Souls 3 DLC, I'm going to have to prepare for.
[396:26.63]I don't know if I can jump right into that tomorrow afternoon.
[396:28.79]We'll try.
[396:29.41]If not, then I'll just do Sorcery tomorrow.
[396:31.65]Or Mafia tomorrow.
[396:33.14]And push Dark Souls back to the end of the week.
[396:35.84]I don't know.
[396:36.10]Yeah, I don't need to worry about it.
[396:39.72]So I don't have to interrupt it or something.
[396:41.08]Wait, what?
[396:44.11]Remember this used to be a P stream?
[396:48.20]Thanks a lot, QRM.
[396:49.84]It's nine months in a row.
[396:51.39]Yeah, and speaking of nine months in a row, sub badges are coming out, too.
[396:55.31]And if you don't know what a sub badge is, the longer you stay subscribed to a channel, it, like, upgrades the sub badge.
[397:02.01]So mine are going to be the base, just one month, it's going to be the J. And eventually the J just keeps getting fatter and more wealthy.
[397:09.56]And the two-year sub badge is going to be, like, a fat fuck J with, like, a sultan cape and, like, a hook.
[397:15.14]What are these guys?
[397:15.64]What are these guys?
[397:16.22]What are these guys?
[397:16.68]What are these guys?
[397:18.08]What are these guys?
[397:19.66]What are these guys?
[397:21.24]What?
[397:26.24]What?
[397:31.96]Okay, we're dead.
[397:33.59]Wipe it up.
[397:37.29]The whole room, Pauls.
[397:38.11]Gotta kill them all.
[397:42.07]Yeah, the two-year sub-badge that you can choose is the J is a fat shit.
[397:47.93]And he has like a crown and like a sultan cape and like a bunch of gems and jewels all over him.
[397:54.83]It's gonna be fun.
[397:56.46]And there's gonna be all kinds of ones in between.
[398:03.08]I foretold this.
[398:04.58]You die now.
[398:07.34]Yeah, just like it was in Burning Crusade.
[398:09.21]It was like that in Burning Crusade.
[398:10.27]He's right.
[398:23.79]Well, I'm still here.
[398:24.39]I got a rumbling in my tummy, but I might just go eat like a snack on stream.
[398:31.23]I think I have like a full cake.
[398:32.37]You want me to eat a whole cake on stream?
[398:38.92]What if I just go get a whole cake?
[398:42.90]And eat the whole cake in like five minutes.
[398:48.19]Can I get a two-year sub badge if I pay 25,000 bits?
[398:51.73]I don't think that's how it works.
[398:58.07]I think it's only for subscriptions.
[399:00.46]I don't think you can buy your way into it.
[399:03.04]Yes, please.
[399:04.80]No, I'm not eating a whole cake.
[399:06.22]Pretend I never said that.
[399:12.72]Okay, what if I sit in the cake on stream?
[399:22.39]I take off the lid, and I just sit in the cake.
[399:25.25]What do you think?
[399:32.29]No shortcuts.
[399:40.34]Hey, SketchyDragon, thanks for nine months.
[399:44.34]Congrats on our sub, baby dad.
[399:47.72]Thanks, dude.
[399:50.05]This is so far of a run, my lord.
[399:51.93]It's like old raiding.
[399:55.23]This isn't a waste of a cake.
[399:57.83]Yeah, yeah, he's right.
[399:59.40]Nah, I ain't doing that shit.
[400:02.16]What?
[400:02.50]What?
[400:06.62]Again, my brain is so dumb.
[400:09.06]I thought this... There's a person.
[400:11.70]I thought this person's name was Special Victor.
[400:15.99]From, like, really far away.
[400:17.35]So who the fuck is Special Victor?
[400:27.21]No, I'm not doing that.
[400:30.43]It's like an old birthday cake.
[400:32.49]What month is it?
[400:33.81]I think that cake has been in my fridge for a month.
[400:36.25]Yeah, it has.
[400:39.48]It's more than a month.
[400:40.82]That cake's been in my fridge, a full cake, for like 37 days.
[400:43.04]I think it's just a vanilla frosted chocolate cake, I think.
[400:56.75]Is the old entrance.
[400:58.01]I remember that.
[400:58.51]Pretty sure a rare mount drops from this guy too.
[401:10.27]Why do I have aggro?
[401:13.97]What have I done?
[401:16.17]I didn't do that.
[401:18.29]I didn't do that.
[401:20.65]I did not do that.
[401:23.81]Invisible!
[401:31.61]I did not do that.
[401:32.73]I couldn't have.
[401:38.44]Did I do that?
[401:40.00]I don't think I did.
[402:07.93]You can like click the log.
[402:24.00]Fuck.
[402:26.04]Oh no.
[402:27.72]Where are my friends?
[402:35.85]None of these people are putting up with my shit at all.
[402:40.73]I've tried to make like three attempts and everyone's just like, shut up.
[402:50.04]Okay, if it pops up that they're kicking me, I will fucking cry laughing.
[402:56.04]I will seriously shit my pants laughing if a thing pops up on screen and it's like, kick this idiot mage.
[403:04.09]See, I didn't fucking do that.
[403:08.35]I told you I didn't do that.
[403:10.01]He's explaining why that happened.
[403:15.03]Silence.
[403:18.09]I hope it pops up.
[403:19.49]I kind of do too at this point.
[403:20.97]Alright, do I pull the whole instance and then just slash laugh and hope they kick me and then leave?
[403:32.66]No, I'd never do that.
[403:34.52]I would not do that shit.
[403:41.77]Delete the mage.
[403:45.92]Fucking million damage.
[403:51.88]Kick the clicker.
[404:05.35]Such a far run.
[404:06.95]I'm the only dickhead that made it.
[404:26.62]I think I've done this joke before.
[404:32.60]Never gets old.
[404:33.72]This line never gets old to me.
[404:43.79]Thanks.
[404:44.11]Never trust a purple.
[404:45.93]What did you say?
[404:46.35]It wasn't me?
[404:46.89]Look, I can prove it.
[404:47.51]It wasn't me.
[404:47.93]I didn't do anything.
[404:48.67]I have vlogs.
[404:52.80]No.
[404:59.48]It's a quality line.
[405:00.34]That is a quality line.
[405:04.64]Thanks a lot, OxyCrate.
[405:06.14]The hundred bits.
[405:09.63]Let's looking for one more.
[405:10.91]That's like as if there's already four or five people in the vent.
[405:14.93]Already making fun of me, berating me with swears.
[405:16.77]I'm looking for one more to come in.
[405:25.69]Ah, the red champagne.
[405:28.52]Who's this guy?
[405:31.55]Cool.
[405:31.91]Thanks for the info.
[405:35.05]Yeah.
[405:36.69]Thanks a lot, Fallish Room.
[405:39.32]I got branded.
[405:39.82]It's me.
[405:40.42]We're both branded.
[405:41.10]Fuck!
[405:45.66]Why is this so stressful?
[405:46.86]It shouldn't be.
[405:51.30]Branded again.
[405:56.70]So that's what was... Everyone was stacked.
[405:58.95]And it was doing a lot of damage.
[406:00.45]I get it.
[406:01.63]Speaking of damage, I'm doing less than the tank right now.
[406:04.21]What a good player.
[406:06.71]Might as well just delete my character.
[406:12.44]You know what I mean?
[406:14.10]Seriously, might as well delete the game.
[406:15.36]Look at him.
[406:17.70]Look at him.
[406:17.94]He's clicking.
[406:18.42]He's clicking.
[406:19.06]He's clicking.
[406:20.82]He's clicking, guys.
[406:25.18]Nice clicks.
[406:26.06]Oh!
[406:28.48]I just did the Overwatch thing.
[406:30.32]When you get to low health.
[406:36.88]It's because you're Arcane and Arcane is total wank.
[406:40.66]No, not even... They buffed it.
[406:42.84]It's now... Instead of being terrible, it's just like kind of shit and sucks to lead the character.
[406:48.19]It increased by like 10%.
[406:54.07]Ooh.
[406:56.01]Hey, the Blacksmith.
[406:58.97]You can sell shit to him.
[407:01.93]Look at these bags.
[407:02.99]What a fucking mess.
[407:06.10]What a mess.
[407:09.52]I'm gonna have to hire a... Okay, you know when you like a hoarder and shit gets so out of control you don't even know how to clean your own house?
[407:15.44]That's the... Hold on.
[407:18.59]Important.
[407:19.21]Oh god, I'm branded.
[407:20.09]Oh my god!
[407:20.77]I'm gonna blow up the fucking healer.
[407:23.57]Thank god I didn't.
[407:33.63]I'm just going to stay the fuck away.
[407:34.97]I'm just going to get myself killed if I stay in there.
[407:51.18]God, I'm reading my wank comment.
[407:54.92]Fraudest moment of my life.
[407:57.90]Hey, Lolladucho.
[407:59.70]Thank you for your subscription.
[408:01.14]Welcome.
[408:01.88]Thank you.
[408:05.40]Alright, now let's actually attempt to fight the boss.
[408:08.33]So when he does the big huge charge, stack on the tank.
[408:12.81]And then he's going to... The person that the healer has to debuff the right person.
[408:23.70]I'm out DPSing the healer.
[408:24.78]That's true.
[408:27.65]Let's do it.
[408:36.54]It's just like Barack Obama is like playing and they're streaming right now
[409:00.51]I got a debuff.
[409:02.51]I'm not entirely sure what the hell's happening, but... That's okay.
[409:12.97]So, I'm just gonna... Do we stack on somebody now?
[409:16.79]Or not yet?
[409:19.01]I think we stack.
[409:20.17]We... Well, we didn't stack.
[409:21.55]I think we just don't get hit by the horse.
[409:22.73]Got it.
[409:29.70]There it is.
[409:30.30]Okay, that's what it was.
[409:32.69]He just did it.
[409:34.05]I thought it was coming from the fucking horse.
[409:36.33]What's happening?
[409:40.45]What's going on?
[409:58.27]Okay, I get it now.
[410:06.37]Just wipe it up.
[410:07.13]We're not going to kill him.
[410:09.63]I didn't even know this happened.
[410:10.85]Son W.
[410:24.88]This game.
[410:25.40]The best part is how they're ignoring your shit.
[410:29.54]twitch.tv/Barack Obama plays.
[410:31.46]You'd be like, wait a minute.
[410:32.20]You go and it's got like a facecam on.
[410:35.70]Should've just went invisible.
[410:40.55]Yeah, the wipe and run back stream.
[410:42.15]That's correct.
[410:44.81]Wait, which way are we going here?
[410:47.41]I think we're going to Moros.
[410:50.05]I think we gave up on Ataman.
[410:56.50]Good job, idiot.
[410:58.68]That was our first attempt at the boss.
[411:00.64]Come on, give me some slack.
[411:02.66]That was the first time we've ever done that, and nobody even knew what the fuck was going on.
[411:05.90]All the magical horses were flying around everywhere.
[411:10.27]But thank you for the thousand bits, dude.
[411:12.75]Thanks for the ten bucks.
[411:14.05]True sound.
[411:16.23]I think we're about to have an in-game argument about if we should go to Moros or not.
[411:20.73]Nope, somebody left.
[411:22.39]That's what happened.
[411:27.09]Oh, oh boy.
[411:28.11]That's two that left.
[411:28.95]Fuck these people.
[411:33.29]These people suck.
[411:34.92]Did you see that guy?
[411:35.64]Jocko did fucking 145,000 damage.
[411:38.66]What is he, an eye level 854?
[411:40.38]I hope he gets hit by a train.
[411:45.24]Hey, Hyperion scum.
[411:46.12]Thanks for six months.
[411:48.45]Have you ever played this game before, you dingus?
[411:51.63]Yeah, but it's brand... You can't expect somebody going in blind into a new encounter to know what they're doing.
[411:57.57]Have you seen Method?
[411:59.23]Method wiped on Sidarius like 75 times.
[412:03.61]Come on.
[412:08.07]I gotta go.
[412:08.63]Thanks for the done.
[412:09.21]Need to do guild runs now.
[412:10.24]Wait a minute.
[412:10.54]I'm losing all my friends.
[412:12.66]What about... Something fucked.
[412:14.40]What am I gonna say to him?
[412:15.30]Something fucking insane.
[412:21.02]Quick, quick, quick!
[412:25.96]Got it.
[412:28.74]Yabba dabba doo, me too.
[412:35.54]Here, you want to look at port?
[412:37.24]Here.
[412:42.70]That's like Barack Obama.
[412:43.82]Like, said, like, yabba dabba doo, me too.
[412:48.52]I'm giving you a port here.
[412:53.74]Get in that port.
[413:04.00]Alright, well... Am I getting baited to leave the party?
[413:10.55]I wonder.
[413:16.57]I wonder if I'm getting baited here.
[413:18.89]This dude has 2.4 million fucking... Healthy?
[413:23.18]Serious?
[413:25.08]That's holy.
[413:30.69]Jeez, look at that neck.
[413:32.45]My god.
[413:39.51]Are you going?
[414:00.46]I got replaced.
[414:02.25]Yeah, my guild replaced me and I like guild run, so I'm still here.
[414:05.09]Hey, Jeff, I'm from psychology.
[414:12.14]Wow.
[414:12.80]Yeah, I did.
[414:13.50]I did hook up with Ashley.
[414:17.64]That girl from my psychology class, apparently.
[414:29.49]Alright, let me ask somebody.
[414:30.73]Let me ask this question.
[414:33.55]In the last, like, four hours, he's just, like, sitting there looking at me.
[414:39.71]Okay, are you going or... Oh, no, I got replaced.
[414:44.50]I'm still here.
[414:51.66]The way he's moving, he's just like, God damn it.
[414:54.40]How do I tell this guy to get the fuck out of here?
[414:58.44]I'm just going to back up and maybe I'll get a better position.
[415:04.24]I can't.
[415:04.74]No, he's probably like a kid.
[415:06.16]He's probably like 12.
[415:08.16]I'm going to have to bash his fucking head in with the hammer.
[415:11.06]Make it go real smooth.
[415:12.40]He won't even know I hurt him.
[415:14.39]Hey, can you leave?
[415:17.69]Just turn around for a second.
[415:22.15]Alright, I know and I'm not welcome.
[415:23.37]Fine.
[415:27.04]Wait a minute, we got another person.
[415:30.70]I'm 18.
[415:33.65]Is he watching the stream?
[415:35.61]I'm not 12.
[415:36.59]No, I'm supposed to be 12.
[415:38.89]Not you.
[415:39.83]He's watching the stream.
[415:42.41]I'm the 12 year old.
[415:43.19]I thought like you were saying that I was 12.
[415:45.17]Like, oh, he's 12.
[415:47.51]You're not 12.
[415:47.97]I'm 12.
[415:54.42]Like, I'm doing so shitty that you think I'm, like, a little kid.
[416:00.38]I have to, like, explain myself.
[416:01.70]Listen, I'm not talking about you.
[416:03.12]I'm talking about me.
[416:08.85]Everyone panic.
[416:12.21]So he's been watching just me, like, pretend to be a widow.
[416:15.57]That's probably why he's not paying any attention.
[416:17.01]He's probably just like, this guy's fucking crazy.
[416:19.13]Whatever.
[416:23.76]Abort, abort, abort.
[416:25.44]No, we stay.
[416:26.20]We're already like three bosses in here.
[416:40.71]Hold on.
[416:41.11]This guy's been here since very... Yeah, I already linked... MLC Stealth linked this Twitch when we got in this group.
[416:49.98]Put an overlay over your action bars.
[416:53.89]No.
[416:55.71]He's pretending to be a weirdo.
[416:57.03]I am.
[416:57.45]I'm just having some fun.
[416:58.65]It's Return to Karazhan.
[416:59.52]It's a lot of downtime.
[417:02.84]Am I even in the guild?
[417:03.54]Yes, I am.
[417:04.96]I have the guild chat turned off because I don't want it to just kind of be showing up somebody else's me streaming someone else's conversation.
[417:12.55]Don't really want to do that.
[417:25.58]I'm in the... Oh, he's got to go in the other door.
[417:38.85]Zob.
[417:44.99]Yeah, he's gone.
[417:48.54]So, wait.
[417:48.82]When I linked twitch.tv/Barack Obama plays, this guy found me.
[418:00.12]I'm gonna sneeze.
[418:01.50]I'll see you guys in like 20 minutes.
[418:06.50]Oh, that was a 20 minute sneeze.
[418:09.08]What guild am I in?
[418:09.82]That's a secret.
[418:12.73]That's a secret.
[418:13.69]It's a secret guild.
[418:20.49]I need to eat food.
[418:28.50]Are we just walking around the Christmas tree?
[418:34.01]Have a happy holiday.
[418:37.85]The idiot guild.
[418:38.99]No, that's not true.
[418:40.73]Not true.
[418:41.69]Not true.
[419:01.15]Hey, there's people there.
[419:02.11]Cool.
[419:04.59]It's not even a secret guild.
[419:05.45]I don't know.
[419:07.05]I don't really talk to anybody in this guild at all.
[419:10.95]There's only one person in the guild I talk to, and that's Boo.
[419:14.41]And, like, stealth and Etalyx.
[419:16.36]That's it.
[419:22.94]So what's the deal?
[419:23.42]Where are we going?
[419:25.58]Thought I played a shaman.
[419:28.82]I have a shaman.
[419:32.06]He's level 100, though.
[419:35.49]I have a Paladin, I have a Red Paladin, and an Arcane Mage that are at 110.
[419:45.59]Make a Biair Guild?
[419:53.48]I could.
[419:54.42]We'd also be Dwarves.
[419:55.98]Dwarf Warriors.
[419:56.62]Dwarves.
[420:00.68]So are we going to just sit around and have some food?
[420:10.75]Yeah, welcome to Karazhan.
[420:12.01]We're like the rich asshole watching the opera.
[420:17.49]What are we doing?
[420:19.80]We're almost watching.
[420:20.58]What are we doing?
[420:21.70]What are we doing right now?
[420:27.34]What did I do?
[420:27.90]What did I start?
[420:28.74]I shouldn't have done that.
[420:33.94]God, blink is the shittiest move in the whole game.
[420:38.78]Dwarf Brewmaster Monks for the BA Guild.
[420:44.61]That would actually be pretty funny.
[420:48.69]So where are we?
[420:49.49]What's the plan here?
[420:50.37]Are we just going all the way around?
[420:51.81]Why are we going all the way around here?
[421:00.10]What are we doing?
[421:01.00]I don't know.
[421:03.78]Stop shaming your party mates.
[421:07.20]I'm not.
[421:07.46]These guys seem like pretty upstanding people.
[421:16.96]But thank you.
[421:18.26]Thank you, The True Sound, for the 500.
[421:19.30]Oh, God.
[421:22.16]I think it's time to bail.
[421:26.15]What do you guys think?
[421:27.55]People are just joining and leaving.
[421:28.63]It might be time to bail.
[421:35.47]Was that a... That was a DPS?
[421:40.77]That was a Deeps?
[421:47.28]And before I end the stream, I'm just gonna go to Orgrimmar and, like, try to fight the whole city.
[421:50.30]I think, yeah, we're already, like, queued for it.
[422:03.22]I... Yeah, I'm...
[422:05.88]I think if we don't do another attempt here in the next like two to three minutes.
[422:12.25]No, I'm going to get out of here.
[422:17.26]Yeah, I got to go.
[422:19.68]No, never mind.
[422:20.30]I'm still here.
[422:20.88]Staying.
[422:27.23]I keep like I'm such a flip flopper right now.
[422:35.40]Don't worry, I'll port us to Storm Shield.
[422:43.10]Do a level 1 raid on Orgrimmar.
[422:47.94]I'm going to pull this guy.
[422:48.84]He's right next to me.
[422:49.86]Shit.
[422:57.10]Permavance the whole chat.
[422:58.26]Why would I do that?
[423:02.14]I'm playing today until I beat Carrot.
[423:03.63]Well, that was also...
[423:06.12]Vablo.
[423:06.54]That was also under the assumption that I was going to have at least two or three people that I knew playing.
[423:14.74]I was under the assumption that I was going to have at least two people in a party that like pre-made go in.
[423:21.28]But that fell apart like dominoes.
[423:25.17]So obviously with like random pickup groups, it's like hard to do brand new hard dungeons.
[423:38.09]perfect world we'd have like all five people in here like we did last time but it didn't happen turns out everybody hates me nobody likes me they've all said multiple times I've heard like through the grapevine like that Jerma guy I just gotta stay out steer clear of him you got these from watching ads oh they added like a thing where you can watch advertisements and get bits or something right
[424:13.08]I at least want to kill one more boss and get like three out of eight.
[424:20.60]Oh, this is a good question for you guys.
[424:22.94]What?
[424:24.68]Where is the Dark Souls 3 DLC?
[424:27.93]Is it end game?
[424:29.21]Is it early game?
[424:29.89]Is it mid game?
[424:31.09]Where does your character have to be?
[424:32.83]Can anyone do it?
[424:33.31]How does it work?
[424:47.39]nowhere oh no I'm like yawning I thought that guy just pulled I was about to go invisible and pour it out 60 to 70. I think I have I think my katana guy is like 70 or 80 maybe plus we'll see if I have any characters in that level range
[425:21.29]It's in the tutorial.
[425:22.15]Alright.
[425:24.17]Well, I'm going to give this one more attempt, and then I'm going to get out of here.
[425:31.74]Kill or not, if this boss goes down and we kill him, kill or not, I'm going to take off.
[425:38.08]I need to eat.
[425:39.26]It's been like seven and a half hours now.
[425:40.86]I kind of want to get some things situated so I can get ready to stream tomorrow, too.
[425:50.10]But I appreciate you guys sticking around nonetheless.
[425:52.72]This has been a kind of all-over-the-place stream.
[425:56.44]First, we were doing, like, attunement mythics, and then... I just came in here by myself, and... Well, at least we killed... I would be sad if I didn't kill, like, more than one or two bosses or something.
[426:15.41]I have a month-old cake to shove up my ass, you know.
[426:18.37]There's a lot of things I have to do.
[426:29.21]Food stream?
[426:30.25]No.
[426:38.12]You got here like an hour ago?
[426:39.42]I'm glad at least you think it's worth watching, so thank you for saying that.
[426:52.96]Almost dead.
[426:53.74]What happened?
[426:57.76]Why is everybody laughing?
[427:01.00]Did that make me a funny noise?
[427:02.08]What happened?
[427:04.62]Social eating stream.
[427:06.65]I don't like to be watched while I eat.
[427:08.69]I had this grand idea that I would... Here's a failed Twitch idea that I was going to do.
[427:13.49]When social eating became a thing, I was going to just eat a mole of Jell-O, like a huge mole of Jell-O.
[427:21.34]I was going to just eat a small Jell-O pack and be like, oh, that was good.
[427:24.12]Good, like small Jell-O pack.
[427:26.00]And then off camera, I was going to bring a huge mold in, like a party mold and eat the whole thing.
[427:34.83]Somebody died.
[427:37.55]Fuck.
[427:43.82]Do it.
[427:45.90]Well, I have to make... Then I had to make the jello.
[427:48.44]And who wants to make jello?
[427:49.80]It takes like two days.
[427:59.39]It would rain bits if you did that.
[428:06.68]That would give you so much money to do that?
[428:16.03]Why would you pay me money to eat, like, a giant Jell-O mold?
[428:22.21]Jacket, I don't even, like, really like Jell-O.
[428:24.51]It's kind of weird.
[428:25.29]It's slippery and gross and it slides down.
[428:29.62]No, no thanks.
[428:30.32]Alright, we've kind of been walking back and forth right now.
[428:37.77]I'm gonna fucking just pull these guys.
[428:39.77]Slash AFK.
[428:41.39]Slash roar.
[428:50.87]So what's going on here?
[428:51.70]Why are we all standing here?
[428:55.24]Oh, he died.
[428:55.78]Okay, he pulled one of these guys.
[428:57.04]I get it, I get it, I get it.
[429:00.36]Oh shit, what's he doing?
[429:01.98]Dude, you're gonna get pulled.
[429:03.08]They can see through the invisibility.
[429:05.64]I'm gonna pull the whole room.
[429:08.45]Wow, that was close.
[429:11.65]That was close.
[429:15.17]I'm going to pretend to do... Okay, do you think people will get mad if they see that I did one move to this guy?
[429:26.45]I did one move.
[429:27.15]I did 150,000... 148,000 damage.
[429:36.20]Alright, what if I link to the meter in the chat?
[429:38.96]Like, yeah, take a look at that.
[429:41.86]148, 9.3k.
[429:49.22]So what are we doing?
[429:57.91]I forgot this guy's watching.
[429:59.17]Shit.
[430:01.73]This guy can call me out on all my bullshit.
[430:04.98]He's gonna just be like, every time I do something dumb on purpose, he's gonna be like, I fucking see you.
[430:10.56]I can call you out, man.
[430:20.83]Hey, well, come on.
[430:21.59]Hey, Caligen, you gotta give me some... We're kind of just walking around in circles here, you know what I mean?
[430:30.47]How do you get your friends to play WoW?
[430:31.89]I love this game, but they won't give it a shot.
[430:34.14]Well, first of all, thanks, Lactose Cow.
[430:38.52]How do you get people to play WoW?
[430:42.73]I don't know.
[430:43.13]I can't really answer that question, considering that it takes a...
[430:47.12]It takes a considerable amount of time to really enjoy the game to its fullest.
[430:52.50]Not really like it used to.
[430:54.76]Legion is way more forgiving.
[430:58.13]You don't have to spend eight hours a day playing the game anymore.
[431:03.17]But you still need to give it time.
[431:05.23]You still have to give at least... I'd say if you're not playing the game for a couple hours every other day, you're not getting the most out of the game.
[431:17.62]So, some people just really don't want that kind of commitment where... Where you tell me I have to play the game every day?
[431:23.92]For like a couple hours?
[431:24.80]Like, that sucks.
[431:25.76]Some people just don't like MMOs.
[431:27.89]I think that guy lagged out, by the way.
[431:31.45]No, he made it.
[431:32.15]He's good.
[431:37.15]It will be a one-hour walk on the la- I didn't even realize that, yeah.
[431:40.03]Where are the portals?
[431:43.94]How come there's no ports in Karazhan?
[431:56.40]If they don't like leveling, if they don't like the idea of having item collection and upgrades and all the time required to get from level 1 to 110, you could buy a character boost.
[432:12.02]But I would not recommend that to somebody just getting WoW for the first time.
[432:17.70]Or any MMO.
[432:19.40]You take a person and put them into an environment they've never been in in their entire life and dump them at level 100.
[432:25.48]It's so overwhelming.
[432:26.40]It's too much information.
[432:29.42]That person has to start at 1.
[432:32.06]Or be really good at video games and get it already so they don't have to care about that stuff.
[432:43.35]But it's a certain type of person.
[432:44.79]You have to really want to do it.
[432:50.86]Okay.
[432:52.80]Alright.
[432:54.02]So... I don't even remember the encounters that were so long ago.
[432:58.38]Let's clear this.
[433:05.45]Alright, so he does the horse thing.
[433:12.53]So I think I'm just going to stay around Adamant.
[433:20.17]Just avoid the dog.
[433:22.75]Stand inside the circle.
[433:25.86]Yeah, don't click C. Definitely don't do that.
[433:28.94]That is a big mistake.
[433:37.17]Okay, let's get this guy dead.
[433:46.26]WoW is a terrible game for new people and is dying because of it?
[433:49.26]No.
[433:50.20]No.
[433:50.52]WoW is a great game that requires time and lots of people don't want to put the time in.
[433:57.75]End quote.
[434:05.09]I hated this game up until this past year.
[434:09.43]Back in 2005, I was really, really, really super into it.
[434:13.50]Got the game at launch, played it for years.
[434:16.86]Wrath of the Lich King, that's when I was at my most into this game, was Wrath.
[434:23.50]Cataclysm came out, and I thought the game was a bag of shit.
[434:27.46]Mists of Pandaria came out, played it for a little while, thought it still sucked.
[434:31.32]Warlords of Draenor came out, and I was like, this is a dead game, this game's terrible.
[434:36.35]That was the point where I knew I was never going to play the game ever again.
[434:42.72]Everything about Warlords I hated with a passion.
[434:45.54]I hated everything about it.
[434:47.93]And I was certain that I was never going to fucking play the game again.
[434:52.65]But then Legion came out and they had to have handed it off to a new team had to have come in.
[434:59.08]I don't know what happened to all the D3 developers but I'm fairly certain they all moved to this game considering shit like this.
[435:08.52]World quests, like adventure mode.
[435:11.82]All the world quests are are D3 adventure mode.
[435:15.91]The legendaries, they added a bunch of random legendaries into the game.
[435:20.91]A new skill tree, essentially, with your artifact weapon.
[435:26.33]It would surprise me a lot if half the Diablo 3 didn't come over here to make Legion.
[435:35.31]It's got a new game director at this point.
[435:37.97]They took the game in a completely different direction.
[435:43.93]Alright, I'm going to sit up for this.
[435:46.93]Mythic Plus is just riffs exactly.
[435:48.67]That's exactly what I was... Yeah, you got it.
[435:53.86]Diablo 3, yeah.
[435:56.12]No, Diablo 3 sucked.
[435:58.24]Oh shit, hold on.
[436:00.62]That's a hard thing to go out on right there.
[436:04.14]Diablo 3 sucked!
[436:05.39]That's not what I meant.
[436:06.35]I'll explain that in a minute.
[436:17.98]Ah shit, I was too close to midnight.
[436:20.02]I'm just so scared.
[436:20.74]Whoa!
[436:23.08]He's doing it!
[436:23.88]Oh my god.
[436:25.54]Why is he on me?
[436:26.10]Okay, I need to fucking seriously, like... I just don't understand anything.
[436:33.21]There's so much shit just going on right now, like in every direction.
[436:35.73]Alright, he's doing Shadow Suffering.
[436:38.13]Get on him.
[436:42.27]Wow, that still just fucking killed everybody.
[436:45.52]The horse is just running in like random directions.
[436:49.36]What the fuck?
[436:50.56]Oh boy.
[436:53.89]I'm not gonna lie, I have no fucking idea what's going on.
[436:57.01]Apparently we can still hit him.
[437:02.33]This is such a mess.
[437:05.37]I can't stand still for more than a second to cast any spells.
[437:13.16]My lord.
[437:18.77]Somehow I'm still alive.
[437:26.88]Doing so little damage.
[437:29.68]I have no fucking idea what's happening.
[437:38.88]So far this whole instance has been so hard as a caster.
[437:42.46]They need to move so much and so frequently.
[437:45.80]I feel like I can't even play this instance as a caster.
[437:55.34]This place is a clusterfuck.
[438:02.44]I was only able to do moves when I had ice floes on.
[438:05.64]That sucks.
[438:17.97]So the horse just runs around randomly and rams people.
[438:24.74]You lose, you died.
[438:30.10]Yeah, I just... I still... I'm not entirely sure what the hell's going on.
[438:35.47]Anyways, Diablo 3 sucked.
[438:41.03]It was a terrible fucking game.
[438:44.39]And then they just remade it with the expansion.
[438:46.63]Am I going the wrong way?
[438:48.88]No.
[438:51.76]Diablo 3's expansion made the game really fun.
[438:56.56]They took what was terrible about the first one.
[438:58.52]There's only so much you could do with Diablo 3.
[439:10.64]To a point where...
[439:15.97]They mean dying a hundred times.
[439:18.55]It's just like learning the encounter.
[439:20.07]How are you supposed to dodge that?
[439:21.33]Yeah.
[439:21.65]I don't know, man.
[439:25.01]This is the melee DPS dungeon.
[439:35.24]I want to kill this guy, though.
[439:36.38]He got to like half.
[439:40.54]All that matters is not getting hit.
[439:41.90]I just have to keep ice flows only when I need to cast.
[439:46.82]And you guys are wondering why I don't have rune of power.
[439:49.10]This is the reason why.
[439:51.35]You have to stand in that thing for 10 seconds.
[439:56.79]No way.
[440:05.50]Reaper of souls changed it and made it good.
[440:17.66]Zork?
[440:18.06]What is Zork?
[440:24.79]It also doesn't help that... I mean, I've already said this, but I'll say it again.
[440:29.59]Going in here with a premade and being able to actually sit and figure out what the hell's going on rather than just like, let's go!
[440:40.44]But, yeah.
[440:45.06]Dungeon Keeper?
[440:51.76]Didn't they remake Dungeon Keeper and made it like a shitty iOS game?
[440:57.30]It was like a pay for gems and time gated.
[440:59.90]I don't know if anybody needs this shit, but here, take it.
[441:10.70]This is done.
[441:11.44]Wow, I think I started that at the beginning of the stream.
[441:14.86]I really have been going for like 7 plus hours, haven't I?
[441:21.47]Hi.
[441:23.89]Hi.
[441:28.75]How are you?
[441:30.77]Good to see you.
[441:33.76]Ready to watch?
[441:34.48]Wait, that's Izwal.
[441:35.36]That's a bad guy from Diablo II.
[441:43.82]Alright, X is the tank.
[441:47.47]Well, I don't want to stare near the tank because I got arcane locked last time.
[441:53.12]I'm going to give us... I'm going to time warp.
[441:55.08]Let's just try to kill him.
[441:56.37]Maybe I shouldn't until we get it down.
[441:59.15]I'm going to just blink into him.
[442:04.07]Oh, he just doesn't even matter.
[442:05.63]He does it anyways.
[442:23.18]They just can't cast then.
[442:24.36]Fuck.
[442:26.08]Not good.
[442:26.42]I don't know, button is hurting me so much there.
[442:36.12]So who's, he's definitely the focus here then.
[442:39.14]Where's shared suffering?
[442:40.20]There it is.
[442:44.33]Wow!
[442:45.85]Wow!
[442:47.87]Wow!
[442:51.74]Holy shit, that killed, even we were all standing in it too.
[442:56.33]Oh, I'm so close to being dead.
[442:59.11]I just have, I'm gonna ice block this whole thing.
[443:07.15]And... Okay, so it's all about getting dispelled here, right?
[443:20.28]Or something along those lines.
[443:26.90]Oh, everyone's dead.
[443:30.91]I'm dead.
[443:33.81]Bye!
[443:37.17]Alright, so why did we all get murdered when we were all standing in the circle?
[443:43.94]Are we supposed to share that?
[443:44.84]I don't understand.
[443:50.45]Did we not have enough people in the circle?
[443:55.90]Why do I like playing Mage?
[443:56.74]I just like Arcane.
[443:58.12]I like this move.
[443:58.96]Arcane Missiles is fun.
[444:06.10]Because one guy was already dead.
[444:11.64]Hmm.
[444:13.91]So even if one person is dead... Interesting.
[444:25.03]Um...
[444:27.23]I said one more attempt and that was like two.
[444:30.50]So yeah, I'm going to go back to my mage hall.
[444:36.90]Somebody needs a port.
[444:38.87]Oh shit, they're not even leaving.
[444:39.77]I got boated.
[444:44.19]I'm not completely done yet.
[444:45.70]I do want to see some of the other shit.
[444:48.46]Healer has to pick the right target.
[444:50.32]Yeah, you gotta go in there with a premade.
[444:53.40]I gotta go in there with three or four people that I know.
[444:56.20]That's not to say that that group was particularly bad or anything.
[444:59.54]It's just so much easier to be in direct communication and know what the hell's going on and who needs what and what does what.
[445:06.95]I want two.
[445:07.41]I'm gonna use these first.
[445:16.43]Now, I could be doing way more damage, too.
[445:18.24]It's just, it's hard to... That's one thing about if you do, like, Mythic Dungeons, and less... Like, for instance, if you've ever done, like, Neltharion's Lair, I've done Neltharion's Lair, like, at least, like, 25 to 30 times or something crazy, right?
[445:34.12]So, it's just, everybody knows the fights, and everybody, it's just, like, clockwork, everybody does it.
[445:39.40]But new stuff like that, especially that it's, like, the newer, kind of more difficult encounters, you need a group of people.
[445:49.81]But yeah, I'm going to change my title to appropriate.
[446:00.78]I'm going to change my title to something appropriate.
[446:02.34]I think it's a little more appropriate.
[446:12.96]I want to do just my world quest while I chill.
[446:16.08]When my world quests are done and we open the boxes, that is when I am taken off.
[446:25.71]But I have three emissaries to do, so yeah, let's go do them.
[446:33.67]Lots of stuff.
[446:36.16]Alright, Valarjar, Dreamweavers, and the Wardens.
[446:40.04]Alright, what are there for Wardens?
[446:45.86]No warden quests in Stormheim.
[446:49.40]I'll just go to Greywatch and go up here and do these two.
[446:55.33]Go to Greywatch.
[447:00.35]Autocam?
[447:01.25]Auto's not even in here.
[447:05.89]Yeah, I'm not going to open any.
[447:06.91]We're going to open all the boxes at the end of the stream.
[447:09.29]And then I'm going to say my goodbyes.
[447:27.60]Valarjar.
[447:29.94]See if I can bang these out real quick.
[447:34.20]Sad days.
[447:38.00]Get him in here?
[447:38.72]Call Otto in here?
[447:39.62]Well, Karazhan is cool.
[447:49.23]I'll get it done eventually.
[447:58.53]But we won't be streaming it.
[448:03.59]There's too many other things that I plan to do.
[448:07.05]I want to play more Mafia.
[448:08.76]I want to play Dark Souls 3.
[448:11.38]Sorcery 4.
[448:11.78]There's a lot of shit to do this week.
[448:16.08]Purple Bird just appeared right behind me.
[448:25.18]Does he have good hearing?
[448:25.82]I'm actually down here in the basement.
[448:28.78]I don't think he'll be able to hear me from down here.
[448:32.30]Let me see.
[448:32.66]Let me try calling him.
[448:35.06]Let me try calling him.
[448:38.28]Hey, dog.
[448:40.44]Hey, dog.
[448:43.32]Hey, dog.
[448:45.30]I don't think he cares.
[448:50.62]He's kind of just hanging out upstairs, probably on the couch.
[448:56.34]Yeah, I was having a ton of fun playing Mafia 3.
[449:01.50]So depending on... Tomorrow's technically an off day.
[449:07.15]So depending on how I feel tomorrow, I might just kind of get a video uploaded.
[449:12.69]And see where I stand.
[449:16.61]But if I don't stream tomorrow, then Thursday will be Dark Souls 3.
[449:23.03]And Friday will be either Sorcery 4 or... Maybe more of Dark Souls?
[449:29.12]I don't know.
[449:29.64]There's a lot of options.
[449:37.75]Hi, dog.
[449:46.66]Video, oh, my God, video.
[449:50.62]OK.
[449:52.44]What these all just changed.
[449:53.60]Huh.
[450:01.07]Well.
[450:03.15]Great watch it is.
[450:04.37]These are also spread out now.
[450:05.33]There was just two right there.
[450:06.17]Why that one have to disappear?
[450:07.25]Shit.
[450:09.63]No, I want to click on this.
[450:15.13]No, Otto did not come in, unfortunately.
[450:19.36]He did not.
[450:19.98]It's almost 1.30 a.m.
[450:28.47]I've got to work, so I'm going to scoot.
[450:30.33]Take it easy, Colin.
[450:31.95]Thanks for coming out.
[450:41.01]Work order is we're just going to kill the guy.
[450:43.03]Ten stolen artifacts, sure thing.
[450:46.92]Let's go get him.
[450:52.18]What?
[450:54.32]Alright, artifacts.
[451:03.58]These guys carry them.
[451:04.92]There's a lot of people here.
[451:10.29]That guy doesn't have one.
[451:11.21]I don't know why I climbed over here.
[451:15.23]To be Frank.
[451:23.40]What the hell are all these guys?
[451:26.42]Did they just all spawn up there and just get camped?
[451:33.30]Aye, aye, aye.
[451:35.76]Bring the stream to auto if he won't come down.
[451:41.37]I can't do that.
[451:44.14]I cannot bring the stream to auto.
[451:51.72]There we are.
[451:54.42]Aww.
[452:02.98]And one more.
[452:03.72]Have I given up on wearing glasses?
[452:09.06]Yes, I have.
[452:14.24]Come on, let me just tag a bunch of people right here.
[452:26.01]Otto is overrated.
[452:27.07]My dog is better.
[452:27.93]What?
[452:29.39]You can't just throw a statement like that out.
[452:33.70]Otto is the best dog ever.
[452:36.68]But thank you for the 500 bits, dude.
[452:39.34]Much appreciated.
[452:42.56]Oh, ban.
[452:43.36]Ban him.
[452:52.04]I didn't want to shoot that guy, but that's fine.
[452:53.62]I'll just AOE these guys down.
[452:59.32]Found a dollar on the ground?
[453:01.65]Well, thanks, Arthur.
[453:02.41]And thanks, Maher, by the way.
[453:04.51]Hey, correct me.
[453:05.87]Is it Major or Maher?
[453:07.49]Am I saying it incorrectly?
[453:09.95]Those greedy fiends.
[453:19.79]Cats are better than dogs.
[453:21.57]I can't agree with that statement.
[453:22.75]I'm sorry.
[453:30.04]Autogad voted best dog in high school.
[453:35.26]Tasty Tea.
[453:36.34]I do have a plan for Halloween.
[453:37.80]I have something I want to do.
[453:40.70]It's only going to be like a 30... It's going to be probably like a 20 minute stream.
[453:46.92]It all goes according to plan.
[453:50.21]I need to go.
[453:53.57]These are all in such terrible places.
[454:06.70]Your reign.
[454:09.58]I guess I'm just going to go here.
[454:13.72]Sexy rat?
[454:14.56]No, not a sexy rat.
[454:15.76]Found another dollar.
[454:16.60]Well, thanks a lot, Arthur.
[454:17.56]Ink sleeves.
[454:18.82]Inky sleeves.
[454:21.72]Take shots for 30 minutes and pass out?
[454:23.50]No.
[454:24.80]It's going to be a Halloween video.
[454:27.45]On stream.
[454:27.89]A Halloween stream.
[454:28.77]That's only going to be like 25 minutes.
[454:30.13]Because I can't keep it up.
[454:32.59]And I'm going to ruin my house.
[454:34.73]It's possible.
[454:35.19]It's possible I will ruin my downstairs.
[454:38.38]It's only going to happen once.
[454:39.50]And I'm going to have to immediately turn off the stream.
[454:59.43]Hallow stream.
[455:01.11]It depends if I get everything I need situated.
[455:06.45]This is not even a good place.
[455:07.33]I just have to run.
[455:09.59]I could have gone down from Valdestal, but... Am I stuck here now?
[455:16.64]Yeah, I am.
[455:17.58]This is not a place to go.
[455:18.42]I gotta go to Valdestal again.
[455:19.56]This is a terrible emissary.
[455:22.00]I'm not gonna burn my house down, I promise.
[455:34.72]Just go to Lorna's watch and go up here.
[455:38.52]I'll do this one, too, if I can.
[455:44.36]Drink snake bites till you get sick?
[455:48.23]There is a tiny bit of coffee left.
[455:49.57]And actually, by the time the coffee's over, I'm probably going to stop the stream.
[455:58.23]I was going to do all three emissaries.
[455:59.51]I'm probably just going to do this one and then lock off.
[456:03.59]I'm playing all day.
[456:10.52]I'm not going to burn somebody else's house down either.
[456:12.49]Alright, I can go.
[456:24.27]I need one.
[456:27.28]Two.
[456:27.86]I'll just do this one.
[456:28.58]It's easy.
[456:29.96]One, two, and then I'll just swing down here.
[456:38.86]Jump, jump, jump.
[456:42.29]Keep the stream going forever.
[456:43.33]No, I'm kind of burnt out right now.
[456:49.35]Speaking of burning, I'm pretty burnt out.
[456:55.61]This is the first eight-hour stream since I pretty much started streaming.
[457:05.51]Hey, wasn't it fun watching me walk back to my corpse over and over again?
[457:14.20]Are you happy you tuned in?
[457:25.09]24-hour Stardew Valley stream.
[457:26.41]I don't think I'd be able to do that.
[457:32.03]I'm just going to kill these guys.
[457:37.27]You.
[457:39.21]You.
[457:40.89]You.
[457:43.13]How come they're not pulling?
[457:51.80]Here we go.
[457:53.20]Let's click.
[457:53.90]Let's be clickers.
[458:02.72]Hey, a brief history of Azeroth.
[458:04.28]Alright, there's three of those dead.
[458:07.48]Gotta go to this camp.
[458:11.34]You've been here for the whole stream.
[458:13.65]Damn.
[458:15.71]Well, thanks for sticking around.
[458:24.51]Blood, blood, blood.
[458:25.49]All three of these guys gotta go, right?
[458:33.12]Give candy to trick-or-treaters?
[458:36.86]I'll probably spend some time at my parents' house.
[458:40.97]I'll give some trick-or-treaters candy with a funny mask on.
[458:51.26]That's my favorite pro clicker doing pretty well.
[458:55.30]Didn't get that far into Karazin.
[458:57.04]Two bosses into Karazin.
[458:58.20]We got to the third one before it was called off.
[459:05.14]I was doing it with randoms, though.
[459:08.47]No premades for me.
[459:10.45]No prems.
[459:16.41]These big scary guys have to die?
[459:18.33]Yeah, sure thing.
[459:23.72]Get off me.
[459:26.08]I just clicked.
[459:27.40]I did just click that Frost Nova.
[459:30.30]You guys got me.
[459:31.94]You got me locked in.
[459:39.38]Where's that rock coming from?
[459:41.90]What the fuck is happening to me?
[459:49.41]A lot of people following me right now.
[459:54.83]Swindle stones for candy.
[459:55.95]Alright, these guys are dead when I jump out.
[460:01.19]Watch this one.
[460:04.07]Hello!
[460:09.32]He's clicking.
[460:16.02]Alright, I'm going to go up here.
[460:17.42]If I blow the whistle, will it take me to that flight path?
[460:24.77]I hope it does.
[460:25.31]Am I closer to this one or that one?
[460:26.49]We'll find out.
[460:32.27]This never used to be a cutscene.
[460:37.26]Hey, perfect.
[460:44.21]Now this one, I've got to be careful because let's go invisible.
[460:57.04]Did I learn all these spells from the Book of Shbees?
[461:05.00]I did not.
[461:09.89]A garrison in this warden tower would be a vital strategic victory.
[461:13.91]For Gilneas.
[461:15.01]Drive the forsaken from it.
[461:16.97]For Gilneas.
[461:21.17]Hey, look, an alliance.
[461:24.06]Would be a strategic victory.
[461:26.58]You want to do this together, friend?
[461:28.68]Wait a minute.
[461:30.16]I think I might be able to make a friend.
[461:34.32]Look at me following this new friend.
[461:43.53]Where'd he go?
[461:43.83]Where'd my new friend go?
[461:44.95]I lost him already.
[461:45.77]Alright, I'm going to get a legendary out of this box, by the way.
[461:54.91]It's going to happen.
[461:58.10]Blizzard can see my stream title.
[462:00.92]And they're going to be like, man, he had a rough time in Karazhan.
[462:05.86]Let's give him a free legendary.
[462:13.27]Kill the guard captain.
[462:14.29]Where the hell is he?
[462:14.91]There he is.
[462:16.13]Captain Swindlesweens.
[462:22.96]Still line of sight, really?
[462:23.78]Come on.
[462:28.54]I'm playing the game with one hand right now, guys.
[462:42.03]Jump off the cliff.
[462:47.48]Right down into these guys and get to 100%.
[462:49.82]Hello!
[462:49.96]I'm gonna follow this big guy.
[463:20.29]Taking Arcane as my second spec.
[463:23.29]I just don't usually play because the boring spell animations besides Barrage and Missiles.
[463:26.60]And it's funny you say Barrage because you don't cast it that often.
[463:30.88]So Barrage looks really cool.
[463:32.22]Like, oh, here we go.
[463:33.28]Barrage.
[463:34.30]Bam!
[463:36.14]Too bad you only cast that move like five times.
[463:40.65]You never use it while questing.
[463:43.71]It's a cool move though, but just kind of a weird... I don't like it.
[463:46.61]It's a weird design philosophy.
[463:54.07]Enhancement, Xiaomi.
[463:54.95]I don't play enhancement.
[463:55.93]This is my main character at the moment.
[463:58.53]Used to be my Rett paladin, but not anymore.
[464:04.48]Not since they made Rett extremely boring.
[464:09.18]Rett is a snooze at this point.
[464:21.91]Hey, thanks for the help, man.
[464:23.91]Can I befriend a horde on the other team?
[464:33.56]Almost there.
[464:34.14]Come on.
[464:34.52]Another couple percentage points.
[464:35.72]I guess to what?
[464:45.21]Get over here.
[464:45.71]Blow up on these people.
[464:46.53]Come on.
[464:47.03]Blow up on these people.
[464:47.91]Oy, oy, oy.
[464:53.56]One more person and I can move on with my life.
[465:02.73]Just joined the stream.
[465:03.33]Do you used to play this game really often?
[465:04.67]You seem quite informed about a lot of stuff.
[465:07.79]Oh, yeah.
[465:09.97]Whoa.
[465:12.57]Where did this come from?
[465:15.11]Oh, it's a new honor talent.
[465:19.72]Yeah, take it.
[465:20.58]Sure.
[465:21.44]This is PvP only thing I can do, right?
[465:23.12]Can I just do it whenever?
[465:25.58]I can just do this whenever?
[465:26.34]Are you serious?
[465:33.62]Okay, cool.
[465:37.45]Yeah, I used to play the game a lot.
[465:39.61]I was super into the game back in Wrath.
[465:42.73]I haven't really put much real time into it until now.
[465:54.30]So yeah, I think you have to be flagged for PvP for those to work, right?
[465:59.35]From my understanding.
[466:01.11]And this is already done.
[466:01.83]I don't even need to be doing this.
[466:02.67]Get me out of here.
[466:06.27]I don't even need to do this.
[466:09.08]One more.
[466:09.48]I'm going to do this one.
[466:11.74]It's right there next to the camp.
[466:19.70]2,000 ability powder.
[466:24.76]Yeah, that's technically these areas of PvP, but no one ever is in them.
[466:28.02]It's only you fight NPCs.
[466:34.01]For some reason.
[466:42.21]After we do this, I'm going to complete this and turn it in, open the box, and then skedaddle.
[466:56.84]What eye level am I?
[466:58.06]854.
[467:01.36]I'm not quite optimized 854, by the way.
[467:04.43]I really should have like 30% crit and like 50% mastery.
[467:11.61]Or at least like 45% and like 26%.
[467:14.29]I'm not optimized.
[467:22.90]I was hoping to get at least one item or something from Karazhan.
[467:29.27]I could get electrocuted, don't I?
[467:30.61]I'm going to pull a drake.
[467:32.35]Come on, give me a drake so I can just stand in the fire and die.
[467:36.87]Come here, drake.
[467:38.63]Storm drake, get over here.
[467:41.38]No!
[467:44.16]Come to me.
[467:47.02]Why do you have to be so far away?
[467:51.10]I really thought I could cheese it right there.
[467:58.73]Isn't there an entrance to a big cave down here somewhere?
[468:01.95]I don't ever do this one.
[468:08.90]I'm actually in a pretty shit spot for this.
[468:16.26]Do some PvP?
[468:18.22]Maybe another time.
[468:19.76]I just want to get this done.
[468:26.06]I love these new zones, but man.
[468:30.37]It's either super up or super down in all these areas.
[468:35.16]Here we go.
[468:36.66]Oh my god, I'm going to die.
[468:39.26]I tried to click on a cookie.
[468:42.14]What a clicker.
[468:49.40]Don't you have to go all the way around or something?
[468:51.10]It's like a cave.
[468:52.72]Somewhere in a fucking cave, of course.
[468:54.50]This is Legion.
[469:00.32]No, that's not it.
[469:09.73]I swear to God, every time I come do this quest, I have no idea where to go.
[469:15.77]Ah, it's up here.
[469:16.35]It's up on the broken... Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[469:21.67]Remember, guys, if you're playing Legion, it's in a cave, it's up on a mountain, or it's underground.
[469:28.16]There's never anything to do on a flat surface in Legion.
[469:36.64]You're never at sea level in this game.
[469:44.31]I know, one of you guys just beat the shit out of me.
[469:55.30]Come on, hurt me.
[469:57.50]Don't kill them.
[470:02.99]Don't kill them.
[470:03.79]Don't kill them.
[470:04.93]They'll cast moves at us.
[470:08.61]What the heck?
[470:14.87]You lost two months of what?
[470:16.39]To cookie clicker?
[470:17.17]What happened?
[470:24.37]Alright, come here.
[470:25.69]Come here, you giant alien.
[470:29.43]Come over to me.
[470:32.59]Come here and please hurt me.
[470:34.31]No!
[470:35.56]Somebody else pulled him.
[470:44.90]Quick, stand in his shit.
[470:56.92]If you don't kill him, you're going to sit here and charge it forever.
[470:58.97]Don't even auto-attack him.
[471:09.43]Don't just cast his dumb lightning balls.
[471:15.26]That was such a lame thing.
[471:16.50]It was just...
[471:22.15]Alright.
[471:23.35]Come kick my ass.
[471:25.55]Bring the whole family.
[471:29.89]Get the whole family involved.
[471:40.22]Kill me.
[471:41.36]Kill me.
[471:50.04]Almost there.
[471:54.76]Ooh, a chest.
[472:02.28]My fucking inventory is full.
[472:04.06]Give me... Delete these mana cakes.
[472:08.33]I don't need a hundred of them anymore.
[472:13.51]I'm sitting here doing, like, taking artifact power.
[472:17.45]Come on, complete it!
[472:20.78]Complete it!
[472:21.48]Yes!
[472:24.35]Alright, I need to... Is he lying on top of the chest?
[472:30.07]Yeah, I think he is.
[472:32.65]Look at these bags!
[472:33.77]Ah!
[472:34.13]It's a nightmare!
[472:37.75]I got nightmare bag syndrome.
[472:45.33]I don't even care.
[472:46.91]Get me out of here.
[472:51.37]I lose like 40 gold, whatever.
[473:02.51]Fuck, that's not even the right way.
[473:06.60]Yes, it is.
[473:06.96]It's one of the ways.
[473:09.60]Oh, by the way, Alaneth is my weapon talking to me.
[473:16.29]My artifact weapon speaks.
[473:18.41]It whispers to me.
[473:27.35]See ya.
[473:30.63]Get me out of combat so I can go turn this shit in.
[473:38.60]Wow, that was some pretty good aim.
[473:40.40]Almost got me.
[473:42.96]Alright, let's see what we get.
[473:44.30]It's going to be legendary.
[473:45.17]It's going to be my best in slot legendary.
[473:50.43]Tell him to shut up.
[473:53.09]Oh, and that little fray there, FlyingShyGuy, thanks for the subscription.
[473:57.63]And TheEpicBigE, he's been around for a while.
[474:00.69]Weren't you a subscriber before?
[474:04.10]Regardless, welcome.
[474:04.82]Thanks, guys.
[474:07.16]Fly over here.
[474:09.96]Give us a legendary in our box!
[474:17.15]What a nerd to leave your base with.
[474:20.17]I plan on it after opening this box.
[474:22.63]And then we'll see if I stream tomorrow.
[474:24.03]Tomorrow's an off day technically, so.
[474:26.65]If I stream tomorrow, it's probably going to be either Mafia 3 or Dark Souls 3 DLC.
[474:32.91]I have not decided yet.
[474:36.55]I'm going to jumble some schedule stuff around and see what I can do this week.
[474:44.89]Were you?
[474:45.25]Yeah.
[474:46.59]I swear to God, some of these names are coming up I'm familiar with.
[474:52.16]Oh, those are the Twitch Prime.
[474:53.86]Are those Twitch Prime?
[474:57.18]Did Twitch Prime kind of come back or was that what those not Twitch Prime subs?
[475:03.88]Alright.
[475:04.88]Legendary time.
[475:05.68]We're gonna get it.
[475:11.40]This is new.
[475:13.84]This is like new that I'm... Okay.
[475:16.78]Here comes the legendary.
[475:19.51]Oh my god.
[475:21.97]Legendary.
[475:23.49]Are you serious?
[475:24.95]Are you serious?
[475:26.55]Oh my god, a legendary.
[475:29.05]I fucking can't believe it.
[475:33.86]Somebody cap that.
[475:35.68]Somebody clip it.
[475:36.94]Woo!
[475:37.52]Somebody clip it.
[475:38.68]I got it.
[475:42.26]Unbelievable.
[475:42.90]Nice.
[475:43.56]Where is it?
[475:43.82]Where'd it go?
[475:46.01]There it is.
[475:46.31]Nice.
[475:47.59]Nice.
[475:52.96]Fuck this dumb game.
[476:04.34]Could have sold that too.
[476:10.17]That was a dumb joke.
[476:11.21]Somebody did clip it.
[476:21.98]I thought purples were ethics.
[476:23.26]Yeah, they are.
[476:23.78]I'm just being an idiot.
[476:24.40]I'm almost close to my next point.
[476:35.11]Okay, I need to go through these.
[476:42.37]The postmaster?
[476:43.25]Is there a mailbox here?
[476:51.05]Alright, what's recovered?
[476:53.37]What the fuck?
[476:56.81]Where did this come from?
[476:57.83]Alright.
[477:03.15]Thanks a lot, Postmaster.
[477:06.57]Yeah, legendaries are orange.
[477:07.77]These are just epics.
[477:09.13]That was just like a shitty 835.
[477:10.65]It's not an upgrade for me, so I deleted it.
[477:14.57]You play with my heart, Dermot.
[477:16.36]Why you do this?
[477:16.96]I don't even play WoW and I'm irrationally upset.
[477:23.30]Dad, please lube my backside.
[477:27.74]Thanks for your subscription.
[477:31.42]Welcome to the channel, dude.
[477:35.58]Welcome.
[477:36.38]Do I have any more artifact power?
[477:43.74]I can't even spell it right, so I'm just going to sell it.
[477:45.18]Who cares?
[477:47.86]Alright.
[477:48.26]Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for sticking around.
[477:50.79]It wasn't ideal.
[477:55.37]I apologize for a lot of the downtime and trying to figure out stuff.
[478:01.21]It wasn't really ideal, but I did want to go for a long time and try to get some stuff in Karazhan done.
[478:05.32]Just check out 7.1.
[478:08.75]Thank you, everybody, for hanging out.
[478:10.03]All the new subs, everybody.
[478:11.19]There were some people that dropped some serious money earlier.
[478:15.34]And thank you to Order of the Dragon for 12 months.
[478:17.78]That's 12 months.
[478:21.66]Yeah.
[478:23.14]Hopefully it was entertaining enough.
[478:25.62]But I will see you guys very soon.
[478:28.13]Tomorrow or Thursday.
[478:30.01]Thursday at 7 p.m.
[478:30.87]If not tomorrow, I'm going to start during the day.
[478:33.09]Who knows?
[478:35.25]But have a good one, guys.
[478:36.54]Take care of yourselves.
[478:37.54]Good night.
[478:37.90]Good luck.
[478:39.18]And I'll talk to you all soon.
[478:41.56]Goodbye.
