[00:01.21]hello ladies and gentlemen of the Jerma nation I'm here to address you guys and talk about a few things uh if you missed the pre-stream chat we had just a little tiny little couple of bumps about what we may or may not be doing today sorry yeah hey banana bros you guys hear me out here
[00:30.64]A dog just barked at me.
[00:32.66]People are barking at me.
[00:46.27]Let's talk about this for a second.
[00:47.35]If you weren't in the pre-stream chat, we had a... Well, to understand what's going on now, you've got to understand the history.
[00:54.95]Last night I made a bet, which was a totally just for fun bet, in the realm of around $2.5 billion with chat.
[01:05.14]And I was told that if we got to pick the game today, that that debt, at least $250 million was going to come off that debt.
[01:17.02]And do not be mistaken, I will shave money off that debt.
[01:22.09]100 million here, 500 million there.
[01:23.79]This is worth at least 4 to 500 million dollars.
[01:29.53]In like joke, like hilarious, funny Jerma currency.
[01:32.31]Not real United States dollars.
[01:35.79]There's already a debt counter.
[01:37.19]That's hilarious.
[01:39.37]Last night in bed, I continued to laugh.
[01:44.81]I couldn't stop.
[01:45.41]I woke up with a hangover this morning.
[01:53.34]I was actually, like, humor hungover, somebody said.
[01:58.01]But anyways, I was like, I'm going to shave off some of the debt here.
[02:00.83]Just a lot of debt.
[02:04.23]So I was like, let's do a viewer's choice.
[02:06.23]Whatever game anybody wants.
[02:08.69]And they chose Star Wars Legos.
[02:12.00]Lego Star Wars.
[02:15.06]Didn't get here easily.
[02:17.52]It was very, very dramatic.
[02:19.14]There were like 30 pulls that had to be done.
[02:24.89]We eliminated Neopets.
[02:27.53]We even eliminated Doki Doki Literature Club.
[02:31.00]Can you believe it?
[02:32.44]I can't.
[02:38.32]And we're stuck here.
[02:39.38]Well, I say stuck here.
[02:40.32]This game's fun, isn't it?
[02:41.28]Isn't this game good?
[02:45.91]I feel people love this LEGO Star Wars franchise.
[02:51.55]I've never played any of these.
[02:53.97]I always skipped them.
[02:57.46]Because to me, these were the licensed, licensed video games.
[03:01.30]I never gave them a chance.
[03:02.54]Because when you have a licensed video game already, it's like, okay, this might be dogshit.
[03:06.28]But then when you have a licensed, licensed video game, that's where you lose me a little bit.
[03:11.94]I'm not sure.
[03:16.42]It's good.
[03:17.14]Okay.
[03:18.62]They're so good.
[03:21.94]recount we already did a recount because I put a few games up there that I was like oh how about we play these ones guys and then everyone freaked out it was if you just came to the stream right now I've been sitting in this chair for like an hour and 10 minutes just debating with chat back and forth and like trying to quell the uprising it's been like a full hour
[03:48.75]Why didn't you tell anyone?
[03:50.67]It was because this is important.
[03:54.46]Free stream chat has a lot of power.
[03:58.88]And it's a lot of people.
[04:00.38]It's like a thousand people.
[04:03.22]The free stream chat decides a lot of things.
[04:07.85]They do.
[04:13.58]now do another recount it's like 500 people no it's like 10 000 people but anyways yes today we're gonna play lego Star Wars I I hope these are fun because if not then we have to pivot to signal simulator
[04:34.51]And if we have to pivot again, we're pivoting to my choice, which is the Black Masses.
[04:40.25]It's like a medieval, 5,000 people on the screen, first person game.
[04:50.87]So, there's a tiered amount of options here, over the next few days, over the next week.
[04:59.37]I'm a new viewer, can I get a song?
[05:01.35]Hey, sup?
[05:03.73]Hey, sup?
[05:05.25]I don't know what your name was.
[05:08.05]I was so desperately reaching to say your name.
[05:15.65]After hey, it was like, hey, fuck, what was his name?
[05:17.65]I don't know.
[05:21.65]I was trying so hard.
[05:23.43]Okay, here we go.
[05:24.29]We're gonna start, this is the complete saga.
[05:27.45]There's like 12 games in this.
[05:28.87]I'm only gonna play, I don't think I'm gonna play this again.
[05:32.05]I want to make that really clear to a shitload of people here.
[05:35.27]I don't think this is going to be a thing that you can expect to see on this channel all the time.
[05:41.59]By the way, see you in hell when I get this whole stream removed.
[05:46.37]Should I turn off the... Should I, like, mess with the music?
[05:54.72]What if I just fuck with it?
[05:55.54]Does that count?
[06:02.26]Alright.
[06:02.56]Go, go, go, go, go before I get in trouble.
[06:05.40]New game.
[06:11.36]F2.
[06:13.79]I try to play with two people at the same time on keyboard.
[06:16.23]Alright.
[06:17.07]Hold on.
[06:17.43]Wait.
[06:18.35]The audio is so low.
[06:19.63]Are we in a bar?
[06:22.11]Let's turn it up.
[06:27.17]Okay, so who am I?
[06:29.43]I'm a big Star Wars fan, so I don't want to mess this up.
[06:32.05]This is Qui-Gon Jinn, and that's Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[06:37.09]And that's Megamind.
[06:41.09]I just... Wait, you can... I just killed a guy.
[06:44.11]I just killed a guy.
[06:46.17]Who are these people?
[06:47.85]Are we in a bar?
[06:48.65]Holy shit, what am I doing?
[06:53.21]Zero percent?
[06:56.96]What?
[06:58.52]What's happening?
[07:01.55]Why am I killing all these people?
[07:03.87]How do I do the tutorial?
[07:06.73]Holy shit, Qui-Gon's dead.
[07:11.14]What was I supposed to do?
[07:15.66]One minute.
[07:19.32]Okay, you can't kill the band.
[07:22.67]How do I do anything?
[07:26.26]Fly-Gone Jinn.
[07:28.02]Holy shit, that was cool.
[07:31.86]It's the hub world.
[07:32.78]Oh, alright, alright.
[07:33.54]Hub world.
[07:34.94]So what do I... Oh, I can force grab.
[07:37.46]That's actually kind of cool.
[07:40.43]Just go to the door?
[07:41.69]Oh, okay.
[07:45.59]Episode 1, The Phantom Menace.
[07:47.69]Oh, cool!
[07:50.75]Wait, this... What is all this?
[07:59.23]I'm so glad I don't have to do this puzzle on my own.
[08:05.50]Oh, sick.
[08:06.24]Okay, I got a heart piece and a coin.
[08:08.68]I have 1100 coins.
[08:17.12]Didn't I just go into the Phantom Menace?
[08:18.62]Why are we in another cafeteria?
[08:21.17]They're called studs.
[08:27.15]I don't know the Lego lingo.
[08:29.15]The last time I used Legos is probably, I don't know, 100 years ago.
[08:32.83]Phantom.
[08:33.33]Okay.
[08:33.59]Chapter one negotiations.
[08:34.77]Here we go.
[08:37.17]Story.
[08:38.03]Yeah.
[08:40.12]No, stop.
[08:40.80]Turn that off.
[08:42.80]Turn it down.
[08:44.00]I can't turn it off.
[08:44.74]Yeah, I can.
[08:45.74]Okay.
[08:46.74]The Phantom Menace.
[08:48.70]Chapter one.
[08:50.20]Negotiations.
[08:53.31]Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic.
[08:57.06]With a blockade of deadly battleships.
[09:00.94]The Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the small planet of Naboo.
[09:05.65]The Supreme... This isn't the same without this, is it?
[09:10.45]The Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi to settle the conflict.
[09:23.86]Alright, we're good.
[09:30.06]I can't hide a DMCA from that.
[09:32.48]That initial... My channel's gone.
[09:36.64]Like, all it needs is that first... They have that exact algorithm in place.
[09:42.22]Is this voice acted?
[09:45.77]Or are they silent protagonists?
[09:51.21]Why was C-3PO just not textured?
[09:52.85]He wasn't colored in.
[09:53.93]Isn't he gold?
[09:54.71]Gold?
[09:58.27]Oh, that took me all morning to make!
[10:01.99]Those guys are dead.
[10:05.02]What?
[10:09.42]Walk up to friendly characters and press Y to take control of them.
[10:14.61]Oh, shit.
[10:15.05]You can, like, mind jump?
[10:17.55]Jedi mind jumping.
[10:18.59]Okay, I'm gonna be honest.
[10:22.35]I'm more of an Obi-Wan guy than I am a Qui-Gon Jinn guy.
[10:31.43]That's a fake fan.
[10:32.55]How am I a fake fan?
[10:34.25]Is that like Obi-Wan more than Qui-Gon?
[10:40.53]What's the point of collecting them?
[10:41.85]Is there a reason to collect these?
[10:45.86]That's a Reddit take.
[10:49.56]How is that a Reddit take?
[10:50.76]Because I like... Obi-Wan's a classic character.
[10:54.06]What are you talking about?
[10:54.86]Wait.
[10:55.04]Alright, let me out.
[11:01.76]Qui-Gon, how do we open the door?
[11:04.00]This is a double jump.
[11:06.80]Jedi mind grab.
[11:08.64]Okay, I got it.
[11:09.16]Here we go.
[11:16.94]Okay, if I was 11, this would be the most fun game I've ever played.
[11:18.94]Can I throw?
[11:20.14]Wait, I'm putting it back together again.
[11:25.77]That's pretty cool.
[11:28.25]You missed a stud.
[11:29.17]Do I really care?
[11:31.79]Get the blue, or I, or... Fine, alright, I'll get the blue.
[11:35.77]How do you block?
[11:38.58]Okay, I'm gonna be very, very honest with you.
[11:40.32]This feels very strange without any other sound effects besides music and lightsaber sounds.
[11:48.71]This makes these guys psycho.
[11:50.75]This is terrifying.
[12:02.72]F-A-D.
[12:05.36]Wait, so this is just one of those games where you walk around and just touch things and let them play their funny little... Oh, look, a point-and-click adventure.
[12:11.10]I clicked on the shoe and it went... No.
[12:21.49]Not even, like, any attack sounds.
[12:25.35]Silent Protagonist Jedi.
[12:26.63]I don't like it.
[12:33.91]RIP VOD.
[12:36.91]I don't- Okay, look.
[12:38.40]Where- I gotta ask that question.
[12:39.76]This is an important question for twitch.tv's lawyers.
[12:43.92]What- Where's the line?
[12:45.42]Can I play Jedi Star Wars on stream?
[12:48.11]If there's a Jedi sound effect?
[12:50.51]Can I play this?
[12:52.31]Am I not allowed to play this?
[13:00.75]No, I definitely am.
[13:01.87]It's in the context of playing the video game.
[13:04.69]I'm not showing you guys my favorite Star Wars soundtrack.
[13:10.69]Okay, I can understand how people think this is fun.
[13:13.05]Every one of these little buttons has toys in it and you just collect them.
[13:21.49]Press every button.
[13:22.85]Wait, what's this?
[13:23.63]I can be C-3PO?
[13:27.02]C-3PO!
[13:28.62]Answer the call!
[13:30.23]He's trying to call us.
[13:30.95]Alright, I gotta stop treating this like you guys are 10 years old.
[13:34.69]C-3PO is trying to call us!
[13:36.40]Hello!
[13:38.32]C-3PO!
[13:39.66]He's not there!
[13:41.82]Guys!
[13:43.72]I hope he's not in prison or anything.
[13:52.16]Who's behind this door?
[13:55.14]Oh, I don't know.
[13:56.50]Bad guys!
[13:57.44]Bad guys, alert!
[14:06.28]Watch out!
[14:09.26]C-3PO!
[14:10.74]Okay.
[14:12.14]Just kill this mini boss!
[14:19.20]Don't you guys think it's fun whenever time you like, there's like a kid in the room and you're playing a video game and you're like clearly killing people?
[14:25.35]You have to say, oh yeah, I gotta get the bad guys!
[14:30.23]That means I'm killing people.
[14:33.24]Oh, bad guys.
[14:34.12]Get the bad guys.
[14:36.86]Oops.
[14:42.94]R2.
[14:46.85]Bad guy down.
[14:50.15]Oh, there is this C-3PO.
[14:57.76]So if I fill that meter in the top, what does it do?
[15:00.75]You're a fake fan.
[15:04.15]Can't wait to use get the bad guy.
[15:06.83]I don't know.
[15:08.38]I'm going to play like an FPS game.
[15:11.18]And like shotgun somebody right like in the face.
[15:13.32]Oh, I got the bad guy.
[15:17.40]Oh, C-3PO.
[15:20.11]Oh, wait.
[15:20.45]C-3PO can open the C-3PO doors.
[15:23.69]Broids can operate Lego panels.
[15:25.29]Press B to activate them.
[15:27.09]R2.
[15:27.13]R2.
[15:33.13]Where's B?
[15:34.65]B!
[15:41.97]Oh, he has to go to a 3PO only pod.
[15:44.68]It's over here.
[15:47.08]3PO only.
[15:48.12]Okay, 3PO's are allowed in here.
[15:51.50]What is this?
[15:52.54]Regain control of your other characters by moving up to them and pressing... No, I want to be 3PO.
[15:59.80]Oh no, I'll be Qui-Gon.
[16:03.41]What am I supposed to do with this?
[16:12.05]Alright, put this in the... Wait, what is it?
[16:15.53]It's doing it on its own.
[16:17.69]Oh.
[16:19.73]It's just doing it on its own.
[16:20.79]I did it.
[16:21.73]Now move it, right?
[16:29.11]I can't.
[16:32.84]I made it too high.
[16:33.94]I don't know what the hell's going on.
[16:38.74]You can bounce.
[16:40.62]It's an optional puzzle.
[16:41.78]I don't know.
[16:42.15]I don't even know what I was doing.
[16:46.17]You can't say, like, oh, I'm gonna go to a little kid's game.
[16:48.93]I thought I had to, like, move them into the lasers or something.
[16:51.11]I didn't know this was a puzzle.
[16:54.27]I didn't know what was going on.
[16:56.41]I'm fine, look.
[16:59.39]Soft locked in a kid's game.
[17:04.95]Hey.
[17:08.05]No.
[17:11.13]Stop doing the fucking Mario backflip.
[17:17.30]What?
[17:24.90]I actually don't get it.
[17:35.73]Toddler.
[17:36.67]Is he stoned?
[17:37.63]Stand on it.
[17:42.47]Come back in free play.
[17:46.51]Wait, I can't.
[17:47.25]There's a wall.
[17:48.11]I know there's a wall over there, but I can't do anything here.
[17:53.29]Come back later.
[17:54.29]Wait, why would they make a backtracking in a toddler game?
[17:59.22]Go in the vent.
[18:07.30]Can't go in a vent?
[18:13.73]Wrong character.
[18:15.23]Do I need to be like R2-D2?
[18:17.09]Okay.
[18:18.35]Need a small character, sure.
[18:19.91]I'll go get R2.
[18:22.25]Alright, where's that guy?
[18:25.49]Where's the PO?
[18:28.18]You need to come back and free play.
[18:33.56]Oh, well, how am I supposed to know that?
[18:39.08]Alright, come on.
[18:39.58]Get in there.
[18:43.06]In the back of the box, there was 120 playable characters.
[18:50.11]Is that real?
[18:51.91]There's 120 playable characters?
[18:58.03]I feel like I'm playing the Lost Vikings for that Blizzard game.
[19:02.61]Oh, what's this?
[19:03.05]Oh, sick!
[19:11.72]Hold on, Otto wants to leave.
[19:14.44]Actually, you want to go?
[19:23.48]He's a good dog.
[19:25.83]Run on player two.
[19:26.65]No, I'm not going to do that right now.
[19:27.79]I actually kind of like this.
[19:28.69]It's fun.
[19:31.45]Alright, so how long is this one?
[19:33.09]How long is the Phantom Menace?
[19:34.05]More than an hour?
[19:35.63]Two hours?
[19:37.15]Forty minutes?
[19:42.72]It's about an hour.
[19:49.27]Whoa!
[19:50.41]Watch out!
[19:53.77]10 hours.
[19:54.17]At this pace, 10 hours.
[19:57.19]I don't... I... Press X to dodge or deflect blaster bolts.
[20:06.36]I tried to double tap.
[20:07.18]Alright, deflect!
[20:18.49]What did I just do?
[20:19.91]Kill this little guy.
[20:22.95]Spare no one.
[20:23.71]Alright, I gotta block it back, right?
[20:32.71]That's pretty sick if you ask me.
[20:37.05]Holy shit, I just destroyed that guy.
[20:40.01]Watch out Qui-Gon.
[20:45.48]Okay, we did it.
[20:50.37]Get him, get him!
[20:52.49]Come on little brother, do something!
[20:54.23]This is definitely a play with your little brother game and they'll do exactly what Qui-Gon is doing right now.
[21:01.50]They just want to see the colors.
[21:07.10]Come on, get the bad guys!
[21:11.32]Wait, what?
[21:11.66]Okay, get the bad guys.
[21:15.66]We need an R2 unit.
[21:16.67]Fuck.
[21:26.10]Get the blue.
[21:29.10]Swore in front of the little brother.
[21:31.94]Oh shit!
[21:33.96]Okay, I thought that was a clone.
[21:45.99]R2 unit.
[21:47.99]Where?
[21:48.21]Get the bad guy.
[21:51.01]Watch out!
[21:54.07]They have shields.
[21:56.43]Alright.
[21:57.51]Harry, you deal with those guys.
[21:59.03]I'll turn off.
[21:59.55]I'll do the puzzle.
[22:00.89]I have to deal with my little brother.
[22:02.27]If I had actual gaming, I could actually do it.
[22:17.52]There he is.
[22:19.38]Hoxic to little brother.
[22:20.70]I need to get that blue.
[22:26.81]Got it.
[22:27.49]Oh, yeah.
[22:31.43]Two out of ten.
[22:32.69]Fucking Mega Man energy containers.
[22:34.37]Can't wait until Kit Fisto shows up.
[22:37.55]Yeah, I'm gonna fucking slay him.
[22:43.41]That's R2 in here, right?
[22:45.03]Save R2.
[22:47.85]Shields are down.
[22:48.95]Get in.
[22:53.51]Come on, Qui-Gon.
[22:56.55]Nice, you got him.
[22:57.93]Alright, watch out, I'm gonna get... Oh, I'm okay, it's alright.
[23:01.52]Get him!
[23:03.42]I'm gonna swing at him.
[23:04.76]Get him!
[23:06.24]Oh, nice job, you got him.
[23:15.88]Oh, Half- Alyx puzzle.
[23:19.61]You're losing studs.
[23:22.55]I'm not losing studs, I'm fine.
[23:24.01]So what does this thing mean?
[23:27.84]I'm like sucking in C-3PO.
[23:33.72]Fuck him, whatever.
[23:37.92]Ooh, put it together.
[23:38.53]What does this do?
[23:45.69]Oh, I don't know.
[23:51.17]This is a cool collect-a-thon, huh?
[23:54.97]True Jedi.
[23:56.23]I'm a true Jedi.
[24:01.63]What's that mean?
[24:03.67]Alright, I dropped a red one here.
[24:05.25]Oops.
[24:13.16]I was trying to kill that guy.
[24:14.08]Okay, so we have to turn this on.
[24:21.46]I do like that it molds it.
[24:22.68]That's pretty cool.
[24:23.34]That's really interesting game mechanic for kids.
[24:27.82]Jump the fence.
[24:33.41]Wait, C-3PO can't make it.
[24:40.76]He's molding.
[24:42.34]What are you talking about?
[24:45.08]Alright, we need a C-3PO.
[24:51.16]I don't think you can even lose.
[24:53.92]How many lives do I have?
[24:54.86]I think I just have infinite lives.
[24:56.46]You can't lose in this game.
[25:02.84]Alright, we need to turn that thing off.
[25:04.39]Where's 3PO?
[25:06.75]3PO!
[25:09.75]3PO, let's go!
[25:13.69]It's the only sound effect that they keep using.
[25:19.55]That... They just use it every time.
[25:24.11]Nice Lego hair.
[25:29.68]Alright, I'm going.
[25:32.12]We did it!
[25:35.71]Ah, C-3PO.
[25:38.67]What?
[25:40.11]There could be people around us.
[25:44.54]You could have hired somebody like me to do this for like $100.
[25:46.98]Oh my god, what the fuck is all this?
[25:52.97]Is it all the characters?
[26:04.79]So what does true Jedi mean?
[26:11.03]I've never played them before.
[26:13.27]Mini kit.
[26:15.05]Can I build my own stuff?

[26:31.32]It means fucking nothing.

[30:43.61]I'm sorry.
[30:43.99]This is like a kid's game.
[30:45.59]Kids might find this stream.
[30:47.87]You think about that?
[30:49.99]This is a mature content warning.
[30:52.93]Before you click on this.
[30:55.21]Why?
[30:57.77]Lego Star Wars!
[30:58.71]Just wanted to let you know that this could be fucked up.

[32:11.99]It doesn't matter.
[32:16.10]Oh, come here.
[32:19.92]Get up here.
[32:20.22]I want to use your jump ability to get these.
[32:22.86]Yeah, a lot.
[32:28.85]Play the game or don't play it.
[32:31.03]There's a difference between play the game and collect every object in the game.
[32:34.89]Come on.
[32:41.30]Come on!
[32:44.48]Only bounty hunters can access these areas.
[32:46.48]Come on.

[32:55.97]Yup.
[32:57.48]Only bounty hunters can access this.
[32:59.98]That's fine.
[33:03.54]One stud is one dollar.
[33:06.28]From the debt.
[33:09.86]Alright, alright, fine.

[33:36.64]I need that money!
[33:37.92]I need that money!
[33:39.24]What the fuck is it doing?
[33:41.18]Stop spawning me in the hole!

[33:44.46]Stop!
[33:46.56]Stop!
[33:47.30]I'm serious?
[33:48.14]Okay, I switched bodies.
[33:54.39]What the hell was that?
[34:02.73]Look at this.
[34:03.85]Alright.
[34:05.15]Every stud is one dollar paid off of the debt.
[34:10.22]Come on, hurry up.
[34:10.62]I need a lightsaber user.
[34:13.80]Come on, I need a saber user.
[34:23.02]Alright, nice.
[34:23.80]What is it?
[34:24.10]12,000.
[34:24.16]Every 10k is one sub.
[34:31.40]Excuse me?
[34:32.32]No.
[34:33.20]It's every stud is one dollar off of the fucking Jerma national debt counter.
[34:49.83]Walk it.
[34:51.17]Why am I not playing in co-op?
[34:54.77]I don't know.
[34:55.15]I don't even know that existed.
[35:02.88]Alright, let's go.
[35:08.42]Collect everything.
[35:09.32]Press F2.
[35:12.82]No.
[35:15.17]Sick.
[35:15.67]Alright.
[35:16.25]The blue ones are the ones I really want to get.
[35:17.63]I think this is like local only.
[35:32.22]He hates Legos.
[35:34.30]I don't hate Legos.
[35:35.08]I just hate everything they stand for.
[35:40.24]Watch this.
[35:42.54]Sick!
[35:49.42]Alright, the counter's going up.
[35:51.00]That's all I care about this stream.
[35:53.20]First it was, oh wow, I'm going to play Lego Star Wars.
[35:55.18]Now it's like, let's pay that debt down.
[35:56.84]Oh yeah.
[35:57.90]Let's go.
[36:06.08]He hates capitalism.
[36:11.64]Told you that.
[36:15.38]I want to switch to this guy.
[36:19.24]And I'll move the rocks?
[36:20.86]Somebody squeeze in here?
[36:30.25]Oh, shit.
[36:30.61]Hold on.
[36:33.39]It's gotta be where I can jump up there, right?
[36:37.59]So you love capitalism.
[36:42.23]Oh, what are you... There we are.
[36:51.61]Gold one.
[36:52.23]Sick.
[36:56.62]Uh, somebody's giving me $50.
[36:59.54]5,000 bits from the Zach... The Zach Zuck IRL.
[37:04.69]Thank you for the 5,000 bits.
[37:07.89]And they say that's $50.
[37:11.85]Jerma national debt alert.
[37:13.77]Your debt may only be abolished if you give us the one thing we want.
[37:17.21]The one thing we need.
[37:18.29]We need the Jerma's dump truck ass emote.
[37:20.89]You promised us five new emotes within a week.
[37:23.13]One must be the rockin' badonkadonk.
[37:25.86]Pay that debt.
[37:26.68]Pay the debt.
[37:29.45]Okay, if I have a Jerma, like, thick-ass emote, that is a, that is a full one and a half billion dollars taken off the debt.
[37:38.13]That is, no, that is, that is two billion dollars taken off the debt.
[37:41.49]And then I only owe 500 million.
[37:49.26]Well, and, well, hold on, whatever, whatever we have here.
[37:52.14]Is that a deal?
[37:52.78]Alright, well, first of all, I need, like, I gotta make sure I can even do that.
[37:57.78]Imagine compromising with like a chatroom about not wanting to pay two and a half billion dollars so you'll have a doctored footage image of your fucking thick huge ass that they can share and spam as a compromise.
[38:08.31]What the hell is happening?
[38:10.29]What is going- what is this?
[38:14.37]How did I get here?
[38:15.55]I was playing- I was playing Noita last night.
[38:22.96]What happened?
[38:25.50]I gotta put the thing together.
[38:27.38]There's that piece.
[38:28.08]There's the belly.
[38:29.84]There's the head.
[38:31.85]Head on.
[38:34.37]Alright.
[38:35.03]That's not it.
[38:36.37]Hold on.
[38:37.31]Move that.
[38:39.41]Get that off.
[38:41.13]These are the legs.
[38:41.99]Move that.
[38:45.92]Where's my little brother to kill these guys?
[38:49.74]Get these guys.
[38:50.36]Did I fuck it up?
[38:56.46]No, take it off.
[38:59.52]Take that off.
[39:09.31]Fight!
[39:12.49]Fight!
[39:15.31]No, I don't want to lose money.
[39:20.18]Why is that flower from...
[39:26.89]No!
[39:28.31]Yes.
[39:31.71]What are these canisters actually worth?
[39:38.28]Oh!
[39:40.48]Oh!
[39:41.16]Oh!
[39:43.68]Put a bunch of filters on that and I'm available.
[39:58.85]Alright, I'm taking over.
[40:05.82]25,000 bucks dropped.
[40:09.40]The worst noise.
[40:12.28]I can't click links right now, guys.
[40:13.72]This is like a crash the game if I alt tab game.
[40:18.41]I can't.
[40:18.79]I can't do it.
[40:21.21]Not yet.
[40:27.52]Oh, this is the guy that goes... Alright, I will do this cutscenes in the frame in the name of anime surprised noises.
[40:44.89]Next.
[40:51.04]Jar Jar Binks.
[40:54.04]True Jedi.
[40:54.82]Didn't get true Jedi.
[40:56.80]It's alright, whatever.
[40:59.76]Look at that stud total.
[41:02.17]That's $60,000 off the Jerma national debt.
[41:10.97]And I made an airplane.
[41:19.12]Not even close to two and a half billion.
[41:22.21]I'm not even done with the game.
[41:32.69]Fake Jedi, fine.
[41:40.20]You're not going to get 500 million either.
[41:41.92]You don't know that.
[41:42.84]Hold on.
[41:47.78]Only level 3 gold block Omega Lul.
[41:50.04]Chapter 3, The Phantom Menace.
[41:53.02]Escape from Naboo.
[41:56.16]Jump truck emote.
[41:58.06]Look, I have to contact my Twitch person and say, hey, is it okay if I put a doctored picture of my big, fat, thick fucking ass for an emote?
[42:06.81]I can't wait to get an immediate, within 24 hours, no reply.
[42:13.79]We're escaping from Naboo and there's people that are attacking us.
[42:22.47]Oh, this is the battle.
[42:23.15]This is going to be like Battlefront, right?
[42:33.93]It's going to end up as a global emote.
[42:35.83]That would be strange.
[42:44.49]Do they both have brown capes?
[42:48.41]Something looks off here with these two.
[42:51.67]Did we both order our Halloween costumes from, like, the party store?
[42:55.09]Like, we both got the Star Wars Jedi costume.
[43:10.69]Ooh, this level.
[43:12.68]Wait.
[43:15.02]Wait, can I be... Who can I be?
[43:18.04]Oh, I love when there's like a rocket launcher involved.
[43:22.02]How do you aim?
[43:23.42]I like this.
[43:24.20]I like this character.
[43:24.76]It's my favorite character so far.
[43:35.51]I thought those were enemies.
[43:36.55]Come on, shoot him.
[43:49.02]Come on!
[43:49.86]Stop hitting the lip.
[43:54.22]What the fuck?
[43:54.83]Is this Padme?
[43:57.19]It's Queen Amidala.
[44:00.37]Oh, she has a shooter too.
[44:04.31]I can't hit him.
[44:08.67]Blaster characters can grapple to other areas.
[44:10.59]Stand on the red circles and press B. Wait, I need as much money as I can get.
[44:18.80]Can't hit enemies directly.
[44:19.70]They'll make a lull.
[44:20.34]Just wait a minute.
[44:25.00]I'm a little busy trying to collect as much national debt as I can here.
[44:27.70]There's a bee right now.
[44:31.36]No, you have to be in a circle.
[44:32.90]Look.
[44:39.01]Wait, I can't... Wait, can I force push these?
[44:42.33]I can force shoot them.
[44:43.17]There we go.
[44:45.96]I need to get true Jedi on all these levels so I can put the national debt down a little.
[44:52.00]This is gonna be a real boring snooze fest of a stream.
[44:54.84]Guy tries to collect like a hundred million dollars in Lego coins.
[45:11.33]The blue ones are the most important.
[45:15.54]Blue ones are worth like a thousand.
[45:16.80]Alright.
[45:17.15]Only collect blue ones.
[45:18.23]From now on.
[45:19.13]And gold ones.
[45:21.05]And get the... Why wins if they're in the area?
[45:26.80]Wait.
[45:27.44]What's this?
[45:28.56]I can like mess with this.
[45:34.10]Purple's the most important one.
[45:35.18]I haven't seen any purples.
[45:38.80]You can buy multipliers and get billions easy.
[45:41.48]Oh, really?
[45:44.00]Well, looks like this national debt is only going to be available for a few hours.
[45:58.05]Ban that guy.
[45:59.01]No.
[46:00.83]VIP that guy.
[46:01.73]Do it.
[46:04.69]Right now.
[46:16.10]What else is in here?
[46:18.52]What about that painting?
[46:19.60]Ah, I need to be able to force grab it.
[46:22.46]I don't have any force users in my party right now.
[46:24.95]You can push objects that have black and yellow stripes.
[46:26.95]Do I just get killed?
[46:30.69]Wait, you can... You can slap people?
[46:35.63]Okay, that's more fun.
[46:38.11]Oh, puzzle!
[46:42.95]Puzzle!
[46:46.30]Oh, I did it wrong.
[47:03.06]You've never played a Lego game before?
[47:04.50]No, I haven't.
[47:05.98]Alright, what does that do?
[47:11.56]I don't know what that did.
[47:14.61]I can't push it.
[47:17.72]I can't push anything else, can I?
[47:20.60]Break shit.
[47:25.39]Oh, shit!
[47:26.07]Whoa!
[47:28.89]Wait, no, no, no, no!
[47:29.47]Get coins, coins, coins, coins, coins, coins.
[47:31.59]And I know people saying, they're not coins.
[47:33.01]Yes, they are.
[47:33.47]That's... Hold on, did I just ricochet a bullet off of the metal and shoot myself in the head?
[47:49.38]What a way to go.
[47:49.98]I put this back together, can I not?
[48:01.62]Okay.
[48:04.81]Cool.
[48:05.15]So, how do I, what do I do?
[48:11.55]Any more pieces?
[48:18.24]I have to come back in free play.
[48:20.90]You know, I'm getting real sick of that word being said.
[48:22.78]I have to come back in free play.
[48:24.72]The developers didn't design it in a way that it could be completed without doing a secondary playthrough to pad the length of the video game.
[48:31.34]And you guys think this is one of your favorite games?
[48:40.73]I'm not going to stand for that.
[48:42.45]I'm not going to stand for that.
[48:50.04]Alright, if I don't... No, don't play with fire anymore.
[48:54.70]You'll burn the house down.
[48:55.62]Don't do it.
[49:03.23]Oh, nice music!
[49:11.99]Double or nothing, make it 50 billion.
[49:20.37]Shit, I didn't even punch that person.
[49:26.67]He said a deal.
[49:27.69]Well, you don't even know what the deal is.
[49:29.43]How could you say deal if you don't know what the deal is?
[49:32.40]Gotta come back in free play to put the windows back together.
[49:39.52]Alright, shave 10 million dollars off it if I do a really good fake sneeze.
[49:44.30]How's that?
[49:44.70]Does that sound good?
[49:49.05]No?
[49:49.73]Oh, come on.
[49:53.67]No deal?
[49:57.77]Oh, yes!
[49:59.33]I met up with the party!
[50:00.17]I get a million, sure.
[50:09.97]One million?
[50:10.87]Alright.
[50:13.13]If I do a good, like, fake sneeze.
[50:19.51]No.
[50:22.19]I need like a real consensus on that.
[50:23.75]I can't just do it.
[50:25.73]No one said that.
[50:26.37]A few of you did.
[50:27.57]A handful of you did.
[50:31.94]I gotta shoot this.
[50:32.50]There's one, two.
[50:37.54]There's probably another one over here.
[50:38.58]Oh, wait.
[50:39.10]What does that do?
[50:43.24]Stand on that.
[50:47.09]Oh, shit.
[50:47.69]Alright.
[50:47.95]Wait, wait, wait.
[50:48.51]Guys, come back here.
[50:50.37]Why gone?
[51:00.62]Show auto?
[51:02.04]Oh, I know I could show auto for a clean, like, 50 million.
[51:06.00]Wait, where are they?
[51:08.29]They can't come up here?
[51:13.51]Why can they not come up here?
[51:21.24]I think we can come to a good compromise of what that actually costs.
[51:29.38]You don't negotiate with the criminals.
[51:32.20]Who do you negotiate with?
[51:40.43]25 million for auto?
[51:41.55]Really?
[51:43.61]What?
[51:46.15]Really?
[51:46.57]That's it?
[51:52.19]That's an easy 100 million.
[51:55.17]Yes.
[51:55.69]What?
[51:55.99]20?
[51:56.05]That's it?
[51:59.25]It's got to be more than that.
[52:03.53]No, no, I don't... No, no, I don't... No.
[52:06.37]That's got to be... Okay, 50 million.
[52:07.93]How's that sound?
[52:09.39]Hit me in the middle.
[52:14.07]20 million?
[52:14.41]What do you mean you're going down?
[52:22.54]30 million.
[52:25.18]Alright, 30 million.
[52:27.12]I want 30 million dollars shaved off the national Jerma debt.
[52:31.78]Deal?
[52:38.35]Got a deal.
[52:40.45]Alright, alright, we got a deal.
[52:44.97]Yes, there is a current debt tracker, by the way.
[52:54.83]I can't believe that was made that quickly.
[52:57.47]You guys are fucking fast.
[53:00.27]We have a deal.
[53:00.78]We have a deal.
[53:01.62]Showing Otto is to erase 30 million dollars off of the national debt.
[53:08.24]Just, Jerma, just print more bald coin.
[53:12.14]That would be great if bald coin wasn't worthless.
[53:22.49]And by the way, it always was worthless.
[53:26.75]I created Bald Coin during, like, the peak of the pumping shitcoin bubble of 2017.
[53:32.66]So you think that has any value right now?
[53:39.77]As of back in, like, the shitcoin bubble pop of, like, 2016, 2017, I could have had Cookie Monster as an advisor on my coin, and people would have still bought it.
[54:01.52]Show feet for 10 million.
[54:03.80]Nope.
[54:04.66]I would rather owe forever.
[54:05.88]10 million, dude.
[54:09.68]Really?
[54:09.98]Oh, wow.
[54:11.26]10 million.
[54:12.12]No.
[54:12.72]That erases the whole thing.
[54:13.97]And I'm never gonna do that.
[54:14.77]Ain't getting no compromises from me for that one.
[54:21.77]No.
[54:22.69]Get that fucking shit out of it.
[54:23.85]Nope.
[54:29.03]Alright, some of you guys in the chat right now are just playing along and you don't really care.
[54:33.11]When I said the word, like, oh, show feet.
[54:35.77]Yeah, and all of a sudden you care.
[54:37.01]Yeah, yeah.
[54:38.53]Yeah, dude, that would be cool.
[54:39.57]Just clear the whole deck, man.
[54:40.69]Just like, yeah.
[54:41.57]Just show them, though.
[54:43.61]That would clear the whole thing.
[54:44.65]Yeah, do it.
[54:45.15]Let's just get everybody involved and get a whole campaign about how we get just cleared.
[54:48.87]It's funny.
[54:49.39]Some of you guys heard the word feet and then just got super interested in this little game we're playing.
[55:02.38]Dude, just as a joke.
[55:04.74]Dude, just do it just as a joke.
[55:08.45]It's not a game.
[55:27.96]Why am I laughing?
[55:28.80]Because it's funny.
[55:31.25]You don't think that that's a little humorous?
[55:37.95]What did that do?
[55:38.59]Shortcut.
[55:40.37]Nope, I just blew it up.
[55:45.19]What does this do?
[55:45.99]Let's investigate.
[55:49.89]That was kind of worthless.
[55:51.39]Really wasn't worth doing.
[55:54.69]This is a serious situation, Jeremy.
[56:01.02]Yeah, well, hey, I got, look, I got plenty of time to erase this dead.
[56:06.63]Missed blue?
[56:10.73]Where?
[56:11.81]Missed a blue stud.
[56:13.45]Where?
[56:17.84]Where?
[56:20.84]It's despawned?
[56:28.75]Alright, what do you guys think a direct, like, fart into the microphone would be?
[56:32.73]Alright, I just, like... Like, somebody with, like, their algorithm that, like, listens for the word.
[56:39.48]Like, feet, farts, and, like, ass and shit.
[56:41.60]Just, like... Wait, I heard it.
[56:43.26]I gotta join the stream.
[56:53.23]That's extra dead.
[57:04.07]I got my- I got my fucking audio algorithm set up.
[57:13.81]Jeremy, you're irresponsible with money.
[57:18.89]This is- Wait, I get- I need to have a blue lightsaber hit that.
[57:27.51]What?
[57:45.36]Qui-Gon just gets cut in fucking half.
[57:51.80]That's not what this is?
[58:02.03]Stop!
[58:05.97]No!
[58:06.83]No, that's not what I meant.
[58:09.77]That's not what I meant.
[58:10.75]That's not what I meant.
[58:11.93]That's not what I meant.
[58:17.02]Ow.
[58:17.92]You guys.
[58:19.12]Shut up.
[58:20.04]Don't say that.
[58:21.62]What's this one?
[58:22.04]I have to be a Sith Lord.
[58:30.56]Add debt.
[58:31.08]No.
[58:32.66]You know, I'm sorry.
[58:33.62]This is nothing we have to talk about with this.
[58:36.34]You can't just add dead.
[58:38.10]That's not how the- I can- we can take it away, but you don't- we don't add it unless it's very clearly specified that it's been added.
[58:43.95]No, you cannot.
[58:51.69]I have to agree to that.
[58:52.37]Is there a fucking sprint button?
[59:01.79]Is interest?
[59:03.55]What's the interest rate?
[59:05.41]And what's the- is it annual?
[59:06.87]How are you calculating interest?
[59:19.28]What's the- wait, what's the APR?
[59:27.08]2.5% per day.
[59:28.38]No.
[59:30.70]2.5% per day of 2.5 billion is an unsurmountable amount of money that I will never be able to erase.
[59:41.34]Oh, interest-free.
[59:43.40]That's an interest-free debt.
[59:54.51]+2 and -2 should decrease or increase the debt.
[60:00.22]No.
[60:00.42]Dude, do you understand how manipulated that would be?
[60:03.37]I would never say anything funny ever again for the rest of my life.
[60:16.64]It would use you guys to just add it no matter what.
[60:18.66]No.
[60:18.80]Alright.
[60:21.04]I got $105,000.
[60:21.24]$100,500.
[60:21.26]It would be $62,000,000 per day.
[60:21.84]Go to the cantina.
[60:23.20]Alright.
[60:23.46]We'll after this.
[60:43.48]Mos Espa Podris, Queen Amidala, and her Jedi protectors have fled Naboo, heading for Ruskant.
[60:52.20]They plan to inform the Galactic Senate of the Trade Federation invasion.
[60:57.14]However, the Royal Starship's hyperdrive is damaged in the escape, and they have been forced to land the remote planet of Tatooine for repairs, where they will meet their new Wizard of Oz party member, Luke Skywalker, his father.
[61:13.69]Anakin Skywalker.
[61:14.65]Hey, Apollo 900 just gave $50.
[61:29.06]Thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[61:34.42]Add a deal and no deal emote for 100 million.
[61:39.64]No, that's not going to consume the stream.
[61:44.17]Oh, it's this guy!
[61:45.41]What's his name?
[61:48.20]Waldo!
[61:49.38]Yeah!
[61:50.72]Right?
[61:50.96]What's his name?
[62:00.28]Watto.
[62:07.11]Oh, what's that guy's name?
[62:09.73]Bulbas, right?
[62:11.25]So, Bulba.
[62:14.18]Jesus Christ!
[62:17.38]How do I drive?
[62:22.49]Does it just drive automatically?
[62:23.71]How do I jump?
[62:32.09]Can I jump?
[62:32.71]Oh my god, this is too fast.
[62:54.22]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[62:59.24]Now this is part of racing.
[63:20.56]What place am I in?
[63:21.32]I don't know what that means.
[63:22.44]I have like two stars?
[63:25.06]Two out of three stars.
[63:26.02]Are the cops coming?
[63:26.87]Bad joke.
[63:29.73]Hey, add it to the debt, motherfucker.
[63:42.62]How do I get over there?
[63:45.96]Oh, right.
[63:46.22]I have to go in front of Sebulba.
[63:57.48]Well, here's one thing.
[63:58.12]Can't die.
[63:58.66]Ooh, right on your ass, Sebulba.
[64:13.97]Where's my, like, laser shooters?
[64:24.80]Come here!
[64:26.56]No!
[64:31.16]What was the point of that?
[64:39.12]It's just Sebulba and Anakin Skywalker.
[64:43.96]When will he take the lead?
[64:53.29]Okay, you know when you're going really fast in a game or something and you realize just how fast the sides of the screen are going?
[64:57.99]And it makes you almost want to throw up like instantly?
[65:00.67]That's happening right now.
[65:04.25]Ooh, Sebulba!
[65:05.50]How are you?
[65:06.60]Passed.
[65:17.08]First try.
[65:20.64]First try and a good load of money.
[65:21.94]Come on.
[65:28.49]That's it.
[65:31.41]I don't know why I thought that was... He just looked like Dexter from Dexter's Lab for a second.
[65:39.24]That's $500 taken down from the debt.
[65:55.28]Why does R2 look like somebody put painter's tape all over him, spray painted him, took the tape off and didn't add the detail work?
[66:07.19]No true Jedi?
[66:07.97]Aww.
[66:13.12]I'll take another $130,000 though.
[66:13.70]Odd chance.
[66:25.64]What is the building?
[66:26.46]Ooh, that's Sebulba's car.
[66:36.38]Alright, somebody said go back to the cantina.

[66:44.99]I need to... This is money I have to save to deposit into the... Yeah, I'm not buying anything.
[66:52.55]If I buy something, then I lose it from the national debt.
[67:01.08]Oh, ice cream.
[67:04.48]Buy the multiplier.
[67:05.60]Not a bad idea.
[67:06.83]Smart guy.
[67:07.37]That sounded like condescending, but it really wasn't supposed to be.
[67:10.57]Alright, where do I buy stuff?
[67:15.75]Ooh, put this puzzle together and I get extra money.
[67:26.40]Thank you.

[78:44.27]Don't you think?
[78:53.91]No deal.
[78:58.65]By the way, I had to turn and yell that into the wall.
[79:02.50]Because if I had done that sitting straight in front of the microphone.
[79:07.68]A lot of you would have been injured.
[79:24.20]Honey!
[79:27.30]Why did you cast your ballot?
[79:28.94]What?
[79:31.14]I don't only have 3,000 gold coins.
[79:32.86]This is stupid.
[79:33.60]Get that picture of Superman out of here.
[79:43.06]If you peek the mic, how much?
[79:45.62]Wait, peek the mic does what?
[79:53.03]Please take a look at some of the links.
[79:54.73]Alright.
[79:55.37]I will take a moment to look at some of the links.
[79:57.15]Hopefully the game doesn't fucking crash.
[80:00.75]Okay.
[80:02.17]A hundred million to peak the mic?
[80:03.51]No, that's not worth it.
[80:04.81]I'll break something.
[80:06.64]Yeah, the debt counter.
[80:07.76]Right, yeah, I've seen it.
[80:16.36]What is this?
[80:19.32]New footage from Star Wars DMCA movie?
[80:25.69]This person just made this account.
[80:30.63]This person has one follower.
[80:32.20]They just made this account.
[80:33.32]What are you doing?
[80:34.14]It's wrong.
[80:36.96]Okay.
[80:41.14]This is the scariest fucking thing I've seen all day.
[80:45.91]Is this a real picture?
[80:48.03]Not a real picture, but... What is this?
[80:58.91]Not a real picture, but is this a picture of somebody, or is this a picture of me that somebody fucked with?
[81:10.11]I can't even tell.
[81:10.57]Alright, give me the next one.
[81:19.22]I mean, this one... I mean, that's just, that's Watto, but it's just my, it's the thing face.
[81:31.28]It sort of just looks like there's a brain-eating slug just pressed up into my nose, sucking my brain out of my nose.
[81:38.15]What else you got?
[81:43.15]What about the gif?
[81:47.03]No, fuck that gif.
[81:47.85]I'm going to put it on.
[81:51.21]That's what you want.
[81:52.25]That's not what you're getting.
[81:54.53]Show it.
[81:54.81]You're a coward.
[81:55.45]I can't.
[81:59.90]No, I don't want it.
[82:00.66]I can't.
[82:03.33]I can't.
[82:07.20]Dude, what the fuck?
[82:15.62]Emote, emote, emote, 100 million to show it.
[82:18.35]What?
[82:18.59]For real?
[82:51.09]Leave it on stream.
[82:52.99]No.
[82:54.09]Absolutely not.
[83:02.06]It was worth it.
[83:04.50]Deal is off.
[83:05.34]I showed it.
[83:12.21]This is good too.
[83:13.17]Hold on.
[83:14.29]This is good too.
[83:27.13]30 million.
[83:27.97]For only the dogs.
[83:29.73]Sorry, but without the emote on the table, I can't accept.
[83:34.01]I'm out.
[83:38.38]But wait, you forgot to say that you would do, like, in perpetuity a loan to me, which then I would have to pay back over the course of, like, four or five years, and then you get a 1% royalty on every single time I ever show a picture of the dog.
[83:51.99]His deals, nobody ever takes his deals, by the way.
[83:54.85]He's just there to kind of be in the middle and just say strange things.
[83:58.39]No one ever takes Kevin's deals.
[84:00.86]Why can't he just say, I'll give you $200,000?
[84:02.28]Why is it always like, I'll give you $75,000, but then I want in perpetuity royalties on top of 5% of every sale you make.
[84:08.46]It's just, dude, just give $75,000 and just fucking be done with it.
[84:11.58]I just don't think he ever wants to give any money.
[84:12.72]I think he just likes being on the show.
[84:21.62]That's business.
[84:24.24]Alright, last one, then we're going to go.
[84:30.56]That's Barbara.
[84:31.28]I love how you know these characters.
[84:39.50]This is unrelated to the things we're talking about right now, but it's kind of funny.
[84:50.01]Junk tank.
[84:51.67]Deal four damage.
[84:52.87]Corrupt.
[84:53.25]Then deal two damage to all enemy minions.
[84:58.24]What is corrupt?
[85:02.90]Is this a real card?
[85:06.52]Excuse me.
[85:07.76]Excuse me.
[85:08.56]I'll take a hundred million off.
[85:22.59]That's a real card?
[85:23.33]Alright, let's continue playing.
[85:25.19]Star Wars.
[85:26.47]Revenge of the Phantom Sith.
[85:30.39]Alright, we need R2.
[85:40.68]Oh!
[85:40.86]R2!
[85:42.44]Oh!
[85:42.62]R2!
[85:48.22]Wait, he can shoot?
[85:54.07]Auto D2.
[85:57.57]Wait, are we keeping track of how much the debt is actually being paid down?
[86:02.15]I just did, no, okay, I screamed really loud and it was what?
[86:05.29]20 million?
[86:06.31]What was it worth?
[86:06.75]I want to keep track of that.
[86:09.01]What was it?
[86:16.47]It was 20.
[86:16.91]It was 20.
[86:19.05]Do a monkey noise for another 10.
[86:22.99]That needs to be confirmed first.
[86:30.36]That's why I'm getting a lot of no deals.
[86:31.80]I'm not going to do that unless it's a deal.
[86:42.76]No, I'm not seeing very many deals here.
[86:47.96]Shit, I just got shot in the air.
[86:49.30]Hit me!
[86:51.75]Don't let them all go to waste.
[86:54.83]You know, if any other character would do anything, it'd be great.
[87:02.22]Irma is dummy thick.
[87:03.38]Thanks for the five community sub.
[87:11.94]You know, it's funny too.
[87:13.77]I've gained like 20 pounds.
[87:16.65]It's definitely gotten way bigger.
[87:19.05]Oh my god.
[87:19.73]Can I play the fucking game for a second?
[87:27.06]Just reflect.
[87:29.24]Reflect.
[87:35.72]What the fuck, dude?
[87:37.04]I'm out of money.
[87:38.12]Alright, just who cares about the fountains?
[87:39.86]It's like $20.
[87:42.05]Actually mad.
[87:46.09]Just stand in the middle of everybody and like it'll hit the other people.
[87:53.39]My favorite part of that song, by the way.
[88:20.61]And it goes... I always like fucking nod the fuck out when I see that.
[88:35.38]What if the active debt counter has a thermometer on the screen?
[88:44.63]Alright, we need someone to crawl through this.
[88:45.83]You.
[88:47.01]Come here.
[88:47.65]Crawl through that.
[88:51.12]I go open the door Oh shit the only thing I have to do the whole game Did I do it Obi-Wan?
[89:02.01]Did I make you proud?
[89:07.77]Surprise Ruby thanks for the five community subs thanks dude Oh this is Anakin Skywalker He's huge
[89:18.97]Don't you think he would be like 3 feet tall?
[89:21.03]Why is he like 6 feet tall?
[89:33.78]He's 7.
[89:34.80]Yeah, and Obi-Wan's like 45.
[89:36.04]Why is he as tall as Obi-Wan?
[89:44.29]Is it...
[89:54.60]The debt, the debt, the debt.
[89:57.44]What about it?
[89:59.06]What do you want about it?
[90:04.06]Crunchies.
[90:05.65]Stop growing at 15.
[90:09.99]What are you talking about?
[90:10.93]The debt, the debt.
[90:16.51]I was trying to double jump across the chasm.

[91:04.74]This is a bad deal.
[91:05.62]What's a bad deal?
[91:06.86]I didn't make any deals.
[91:08.16]Hey, I didn't make... What deal did I make?
[91:09.62]What are you talking about?
[91:10.30]What's going on?

[91:36.15]We are treasures of the great Derma95 sub-debt.
[91:39.18]Our terms are as follows.
[91:40.16]Show auto for minimum one clip worth of content.
[91:42.80]It's 20 million.
[91:43.60]Okay.
[91:44.80]Play TF2 on stream.
[91:46.64]350 million.
[91:48.22]I'm not doing that one.

[91:53.64]You had your chance this afternoon.
[91:55.47]Funny faces and sounds only stream for a minimum of 30 minutes.
[91:58.87]The debt is erased.
[92:00.51]Wait, what?
[92:05.54]Funny faces and sounds for 30 minutes means it's all erased.
[92:10.89]Make Jerma Dump Truck a four-part emote like Joop is one billion.
[92:16.51]And then the rest cut off.
[92:17.85]Okay, well.
[92:27.82]Let's keep track of what we know right now.
[92:30.46]I'm at 20 million.
[92:31.88]Resolved.
[92:43.14]Yes, that was for the R2-D2 scream.
[92:45.02]That was part of the deal.
[92:57.54]There was no deal.
[92:58.36]Yes, there was.
[93:01.09]Yes, there was.
[93:01.69]There was a deal there.
[93:02.95]I want you to go back and watch that.
[93:04.11]There was a deal.
[93:04.61]Alright, I need to get everybody across the bridge.
[93:13.42]Where's the little guy?
[93:20.11]Where the fuck is Anakin?
[93:31.35]He bailed.
[93:35.95]What?
[93:36.17]I mean, he bailed.
[93:42.64]Oh, they're all down here.
[93:43.58]Alright, let's go!
[93:44.12]Anakin!
[93:49.66]You!
[94:00.37]Who the fuck is this?
[94:01.37]Oh.
[94:03.27]Can't double jump.
[94:03.97]Is there a staircase that I'm missing?
[94:15.20]Stairs, stairs, stairs.
[94:16.32]Just hold on.
[94:16.70]Let me just take a sip of my coffee.
[94:17.92]Where are these magic stairs you're talking about?
[94:24.50]Oh.
[94:30.80]A pronovarox.
[94:32.68]Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[94:34.40]A lot of subs today.
[94:36.42]Thanks, guys.
[94:37.48]Thanks for the subs.
[94:40.34]I'm going to be enjoying a nice sub sandwich later.
[94:42.29]I don't know.
[94:45.40]What's your favorite sandwich?
[94:49.69]This is multi-level marketing.
[94:53.19]What did I do?
[94:54.71]I didn't do any multi-level marketing.
[95:02.13]Taco Bell is not a sub.
[95:04.17]Surprise, Ruby.
[95:04.79]Another five subs.
[95:05.37]Thanks.
[95:05.93]Surprise, Ruby.
[95:08.33]Jersey Mike's.
[95:08.87]I don't know.
[95:20.25]Jersey Mike's turkey sub with mayo.
[95:22.21]Damn.
[95:23.53]You got my attention.
[95:25.80]You actually do have my attention.
[95:27.10]You really do.
[95:32.06]You have it.
[95:35.50]How do I swap?
[95:37.56]I guess you could just kill Anakin and you get to swap.
[95:40.55]No, you don't.
[95:50.76]Let's go.
[95:53.58]Can I swap?
[96:02.39]Oh, that was a noise that's worth a few bucks.
[96:12.60]Alright, attack.
[96:16.65]Bones.
[96:18.82]Stones.
[96:20.54]Yes, sir.
[96:21.26]Get the stones.
[96:23.20]Stones.
[96:26.24]Yes, sir.
[96:26.58]How?
[96:27.12]Get those stones.
[96:30.28]Where's that from?
[96:32.12]What is that?
[96:34.35]Stones.
[96:34.75]What is that?
[96:40.05]From this stream?
[96:40.89]That's from the fifth element.
[96:43.31]Oh, right.
[96:43.79]Yeah, it is.
[96:51.59]It's Gary Oldman, right?
[96:52.55]Yeah, I got it.
[97:00.96]It's my favorite childhood game.
[97:13.63]Collect.
[97:15.63]Collect.
[97:17.29]Anybody else jump high?
[97:21.03]Wait a minute.
[97:24.37]Crafting.
[97:29.71]Anakin.
[97:30.01]That's not a vent.
[97:37.83]Sure.
[97:38.05]Okay.
[97:43.70]Hold on.
[97:45.88]I need to have somebody stand on that.
[97:47.50]And then this is a co-op thing.
[97:56.87]I'm not making an Among Us joke.
[97:58.31]No, you're not going to get that out of me today.
[97:59.51]I don't even care.
[98:01.31]Stand on it.
[98:06.55]Oh, I'm over it.
[98:07.26]I'm over that.
[98:08.40]Aren't you?
[98:12.44]Why is he doing that?
[98:21.57]The force.
[98:24.47]He made it and I didn't.
[98:25.25]Fuck.
[98:27.67]When they jumped together I thought they were the same.
[98:29.49]Like they blended together.
[98:30.27]They have the same fucking Halloween costume on.
[98:41.82]Vent.
[98:47.72]Free money.
[98:48.92]All of you.
[98:49.26]Remember they don't celebrate Halloween in space.
[98:55.16]Now you're gonna next see something they don't celebrate Christmas.
[98:57.20]Or Thanksgiving.
[98:58.84]Or like New Year's.
[99:00.32]There's a version of it.
[99:00.96]We have to get everybody up here.
[99:14.26]And everybody pulls like the Warcraft.
[99:16.03]There's like a feast of winter time!
[99:19.13]The winter's feast!
[99:21.83]It's Christmas, you know, whatever.
[99:27.71]Feast of Winter Veil, yeah.
[99:29.55]If there's no, like, Christmas or, like, Hanukkah or whatever in space, then they'll make their own one up.
[99:41.05]What is this?
[99:42.59]Mayonnaise.
[99:43.27]Why is there a mayonnaise emote?
[99:44.15]Who has a mayo emote?
[99:45.20]And why are there not enough people up here?
[99:50.26]Get up here!
[99:55.28]Who didn't come up with us?
[99:58.51]Whatever.
[99:58.77]I have to make the path for them.
[100:10.65]Ah fuck, somebody else will do it.
[100:15.56]Oh.
[100:16.30]I did it.
[100:17.78]I did it.
[100:22.08]What's an actual good deal?
[100:29.45]Make the path for everybody.
[100:30.72]Alright, I gotta... Neopets for 100 million.
[100:37.28]Alright, somebody... I was gonna do Neopets before we did the Insanity.
[100:40.58]Somebody said that, like, my credit card information is gonna get stolen.
[100:42.98]What does that mean?
[100:44.64]Somebody said, like, don't.
[100:45.42]Like, Neopets is, like, a not even secure, like, HTTPS website.
[100:48.86]Like, what does that mean?
[100:49.88]Help me.
[100:58.72]Is that fake?
[100:59.62]Is this false?
[101:07.45]A lot of money.
[101:08.37]What happened to me?
[101:12.47]Oh, it exploded!
[101:13.31]He's just a Neopet hater.
[101:22.93]I've never played it.
[101:23.53]Alright, so can I get everybody up here now?
[101:30.18]Play Toontown.
[101:30.88]Oh my god.
[101:31.62]How do I open that?
[101:36.34]How do I get everybody up here?
[101:40.99]Is this like a magic thing I have to do?
[101:48.45]Please play Toontown.
[101:50.17]Please play Toontown.
[101:59.54]Break the flowers.
[102:00.38]Well, that's a weed, but... I promised an MMO shitshow part 2 and never did it.
[102:10.48]Yeah, you're right, I did.
[102:13.17]Yeah, you're right, I did.
[102:14.77]Oh my god, that's what I had to do.
[102:17.55]Alright, Qui-Gon, let's get up there.
[102:18.71]Get on it.
[102:33.56]We've proposed a new offer.
[102:39.35]No, hold on.
[102:39.99]Let me just get to the end of this level.
[102:41.61]I'm almost done with the Phantom Menace.
[102:51.38]Link, hold on.
[102:51.74]I'm almost done with the Phantom Menace.
[102:52.62]Wait.
[102:53.26]You're distracting me.
[102:59.58]Switch sides.
[103:03.10]Eat a spoon of mayo.
[103:04.86]Wait, does that work?
[103:05.74]Is that for real?
[103:09.29]Is that an actual part of the deal?
[103:12.13]I tried to double jump and it didn't work.
[103:13.93]I literally pressed double jump and it didn't do anything.
[103:40.18]Sup?
[103:46.24]Yep, perception.
[103:47.00]I'm jumping in the perfect angle.
[103:52.10]Perfect angle.
[103:52.96]Alright, let's go.
[103:57.28]Everyone was waiting for me.
[103:59.94]I took the long way back.
[104:01.26]Sorry, guys.
[104:02.70]I know you wanted to pull the next mob, but I got lost in the instance.
[104:06.37]That's another wild joke.
[104:07.23]I'll take a fucking +2, please.
[104:17.07]For a good WoW joke, that's at least $50,000 off, right?
[104:19.63]Something like that.
[104:32.74]Begging.
[104:38.48]Oh, mutants!
[104:43.88]Mutants!
[104:52.75]How do I sprint?
[104:53.33]Somebody said there's a way to sprint, right?
[105:02.17]Oh, by the way, that Star Wars VR game that's coming out, is that an actual lightsaber fight?
[105:08.30]Somebody finally made that fucking game?
[105:12.08]I cannot believe out of everything we've ever seen in VR, they didn't make a VR game.
[105:19.22]A lightsaber view- what- what could you possibly be thinking?
[105:24.90]It's all space combat.
[105:26.46]I don't understand.
[105:29.83]You have the perfect opportunity to have a lightsaber one-to-one thing that everybody has wanted for a decade.
[105:38.85]A decade!
[105:40.45]And you're gonna make a space combat simulator?
[105:42.59]No.
[105:52.27]Blade and Sorcery.
[105:52.99]But Blade and Sorcery is just a fun little wave and I'm talking about like a Jedi lightsaber Lucasfilm co-sponsored video game where you play as a Jedi with the one-to-one lightsaber.
[106:15.13]We have that already.
[106:15.95]We do not have that already.
[106:17.01]I mean, we have that already.
[106:21.18]No, we don't.
[106:24.89]Star Wars Connect.
[106:26.39]That's not even close to what I'm talking about.
[106:32.11]Vader Immortal.
[106:35.31]I feel like you made that up.
[106:37.58]What is Vader Immortal?
[106:43.50]Vader Immortal.
[106:46.46]How do I get up here?
[106:55.10]It's an Oculus game.
[106:56.10]Can I do anything up here to open this?
[107:07.79]It's real.
[107:10.85]Break the chairs.
[107:18.96]It's good money.
[107:19.44]Did you even read the tutorial?
[107:21.70]There was no tutorial.
[107:28.06]Or Scrapple.
[107:29.34]Is there any more stuff?
[107:38.73]Table.
[107:41.47]I just choked.
[107:42.60]I just choked R2-D2 for no reason.
[107:47.38]Wait, that's a red brick!
[107:48.34]What's a red brick do?
[107:50.72]That's gotta be worth some money.
[108:01.09]So what the hell?
[108:07.78]I need a third table, but wait, that- Gray tracing floors?
[108:18.98]They actually look really good.
[108:23.58]Oh, wait!
[108:27.75]I just re- I just rearranged the furniture, it didn't do anything.
[108:37.88]That doesn't help me.
[108:38.52]That link.
[108:42.54]Hold on.
[108:44.66]That link, that link, that link, that link.
[108:50.22]That's a scary link.
[109:06.29]And you have new terms.
[109:07.29]Let me see them.
[109:11.77]Elman's extra heavy mayonnaise.
[109:14.13]Wait, there's an extra heavy mayonnaise?
[109:20.89]What is extra heavy?
[109:24.09]This doesn't, is this, that's not a real product?
[109:26.55]Extra heavy mayonnaise?
[109:31.27]helmet's extra heavy eat the whole thing on stream for 1 billion off I'm not I'm not gonna do that what is extra heavy that's kind of sounds gross here's better terms okay real deal let's see what this one says
[109:54.76]Real deal.
[109:55.90]Dump truck ass emote.
[109:57.38]TF2 stream.
[109:58.66]Four additional emotes.
[109:59.82]Debt erased when all is fulfilled.
[110:11.87]Hmm.
[110:17.15]I don't know.
[110:17.91]I don't know.
[110:18.25]Some of those.
[110:19.70]At least one or two of those things I'm not so sure about.
[110:25.46]You never stated it had to be a four-part ass emote.
[110:28.64]You guys are gonna get me fucking banned.
[110:32.36]I'm gonna get dropped from twitch.tv.
[110:36.85]It'll be worth it.
[110:49.68]Take the risk.
[110:53.40]Why would I take that risk?
[110:57.81]The four-part, like, mega-ass emote.
[111:01.58]My- You know why that- Here's why I- There's nothing about me getting banned.
[111:06.59]Here's why I don't think that's a good idea.
[111:08.73]Because you guys will go to whatever other streamers that you watch, whether it's, you know, this person, that person.
[111:16.30]You are going to four-part thick Jerma ass emote and fuck up their stream.
[111:21.68]And they're going to be really annoyed that there's just an ass, a huge thick ass that keeps showing up.
[111:27.06]And that they can't stop it and they can't turn it off.
[111:30.05]You're gonna start getting banned?
[111:31.11]You're gonna start getting, like, timed out in other streamers' chats?
[111:34.23]And then they're gonna come back to me, and they're gonna be like, Dude, did you make, like, a four-part huge, like, thick, booty-ass, huge-ass emote?
[111:41.14]And I'm gonna have to say yes.
[111:54.93]I'm going to have to explain myself to all the people that I annoy.
[111:58.60]Watch out, rollers!
[112:05.24]This really is just multi-boxing.
[112:06.56]I'm just trying to... I signed up for like refer a friend like 12 times.
[112:11.64]So we have like a 6 million percent increase in experience.
[112:14.32]You're just going to start seeing randomly gold particle effects.
[112:21.25]Just fly around each individual one of these people at random times.
[112:35.03]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[112:39.19]Dear Mr. Dump Truck.
[112:44.93]That's, hey, that's Dr. Dump Truck to you.
[112:57.49]Hellman's real extra thick mail is a...
[113:02.38]I can't even read it.
[113:03.74]You guys are going too fast.
[113:04.64]I don't know what you're doing.
[113:05.46]I can't even read it.
[113:09.88]Oh, R2 can't make it.
[113:14.43]Dr. Dump Truck could be in the rumble.
[113:19.27]Yeah, maybe if it was WWE 2K13 or 14.
[113:21.47]Because then I could just have the Aspie, the slider that's all the way to the end.
[113:28.57]And everything else is tiny.
[113:36.89]Alright, you know what's confusing me as well?
[113:39.01]They all have the mustache on.
[113:40.87]It's hard to... They're all the same person.
[113:46.01]I don't even know who that... These are all the same... Who are these people?
[113:53.78]It's all like different Mario's.
[114:06.26]Ooh, shake it!
[114:11.52]By the way, we're almost done with the Phantom Menace of the complete saga.
[114:18.11]Where the hell's Darth Maul?
[114:20.73]He hasn't shown up once.
[114:37.71]He's up your ass.
[114:39.23]Alright.
[114:49.37]That's such like an old, drunk, fucking fat guy thing to say.
[114:56.29]Anybody seen my glasses?
[114:59.43]Yeah, they're up your ass.
[115:04.67]Up your ass.
[115:05.29]Have you checked up your ass?
[115:07.89]No, I haven't.
[115:13.27]Up your ass.
[115:25.78]Up your ass, Andy.
[115:27.80]Be quiet.
[115:33.39]Mario!
[115:35.99]Mario!
[115:38.54]Mario!
[115:48.18]Shake it up and you get the goods inside.
[115:52.50]Stop Crack Mario.
[115:55.86]How's that Crack Mario?
[116:01.51]Can't hit these bricks?
[116:06.40]Alright.
[116:10.52]One.
[116:12.43]Two.
[116:14.13]Three.
[116:18.53]We're all about the links the last few days, aren't we?
[116:21.31]Tons of crack links coming in.
[116:23.39]More than usual.
[116:25.54]There's tons of just crack links.
[116:33.44]Damn it.
[116:35.57]Who can get up there?
[116:37.39]Can you guys get up here?
[116:43.79]Who can jump this?
[116:47.50]Nobody can.
[116:48.00]There's one guy making all these bad links.
[116:53.56]One man link spammer?
[116:55.02]Is that what you're saying?
[116:56.76]Didn't I save these guys?
[117:02.79]I saved these two.
[117:03.57]Alright, I gotta save the rest of them.
[117:09.48]One man spam.
[117:21.53]Got it.
[117:21.95]Okay.

[117:36.80]Okay, so chat.
[117:38.08]Here's what we're gonna do.
[117:39.30]Chat.
[117:42.14]I've- I've seen this before.
[117:42.96]You guys don't like being just called like a chat, right?
[117:54.53]What do you like to be called?
[117:56.83]Jeremiah?
[117:57.07]By the way, people get annoyed when they find out that that's what I call this community.
[118:04.61]Oh, what's the community?
[118:06.15]The germs.
[118:07.21]The Jermas.
[118:09.61]Like the clowns.
[118:10.47]No, the Jermamites.
[118:11.67]And they go, fuck that.
[118:14.89]Fuck that.
[118:15.21]Don't tell me how to run my community.
[118:17.07]First of all.
[118:17.69]Second of all.
[118:19.93]That's what it is.
[118:24.61]How dare you tell me how to run my community?
[118:28.87]Paul.
[118:34.31]Everyone right now is fucking searching for like the streamer or the YouTuber whose name is Paul.
[118:39.42]Who's he talking about?
[118:39.94]Who's he talking about?
[118:40.56]Who is that?
[118:41.22]Who's Paul?
[118:41.48]I wonder who that is.
[118:42.76]Who is he? Who is he? Who is he? Who is he? Who is he? Who is he?
[118:47.48]Hey Paul Jerma said you're an idiot.
[119:05.27]Place it.
[119:06.13]Pull it.
[119:06.95]Flop it.
[119:07.83]Twist it.
[119:10.45]R2-D2 sound.
[119:18.98]Gotta collect every coin.
[119:28.93]every single coin.
[119:32.00]I will not part with one single coin.
[119:37.64]Not one trinket.
[119:45.70]Oh, little thief.
[119:48.50]Oh, you're so magnificent.
[119:50.42]The stories they tell us surely are immountable and unsubmountable to you, most smog the powerful.
[119:57.31]Is that what they say?
[119:59.55]Beef.
[120:02.67]I almost want you to take it.
[120:05.77]If I can see it, eat him aside.
[120:09.47]Watch his very bright brain.
[120:13.49]I haven't seen the movie in a very long time.
[120:15.23]I tried.
[120:26.51]Come on!
[120:27.01]Break it!
[120:32.33]What is this?
[120:32.71]How can I not open this?
[120:39.52]I just walked off the edge.
[120:40.66]Alright, let's go!
[120:41.34]Come on!
[120:41.86]Go!
[120:42.92]Where's Darth Maul?
[120:45.38]Why didn't I play Lego Lord of the Rings?
[120:49.66]Wait.
[120:50.48]Wait, where's this last person?
[120:52.16]Where's this last, like, hostage?
[120:56.82]What's cool in Lord of the Rings?
[121:03.07]This is plus a full letter grade.
[121:04.35]I have to be- Yeah, this is plus a full letter grade.
[121:12.92]Where's this- Oh, what are you doing then?
[121:14.46]Be free!
[121:20.15]There's somebody just holding a gun out.
[121:22.89]Thought I was gonna die.
[121:23.39]There's somebody just holding a gun to one of the hostages somewhere.
[121:26.99]Just watching this.
[121:29.13]It's like, where is he?
[121:39.05]Where is he?
[121:39.55]Oh, down?
[121:41.72]No, he's up.
[121:46.56]Above the entrance.
[121:51.50]Wait.
[121:51.66]Can I get this person to jump over here?
[121:57.16]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[121:59.16]All the way back.
[122:00.34]I need to sprint.
[122:02.26]How much for ASCAM?
[122:03.74]Zero.
[122:06.25]But no, seriously, what's better?
[122:07.13]Lord of the Rings or Star Wars?
[122:08.35]That's a tough one.
[122:11.65]Lord of the Rings or Star Wars?
[122:13.05]What's better?
[122:15.05]Hmm.
[122:20.33]Well...
[122:22.78]Oh, Lord of the Rings is probably... This is actually kind of hard.
[122:30.51]Oh, there he is.
[122:33.75]Alright, somebody shoot that.
[122:34.57]Shoot him, shoot him, shoot him, shoot, shoot, shoot.
[122:45.63]Saw.
[122:46.77]Yeah, saw is better.
[122:52.84]I need to get up there!
[122:53.60]Come here!
[123:00.81]Get up there and shoot!
[123:01.39]Saved him!
[123:05.69]Okay, so, um... If I really had to do it, if I really had to make the decision... I would probably say... Hmm...
[123:18.87]Okay, I like the Lord of the Rings world more.
[123:22.39]But I like the Star Wars objects more.
[123:34.08]That makes sense for some of you, right?
[123:37.26]Like the weapons in Star Wars and the stuff and the ships and the lightsabers and the... I like that more.
[123:46.94]And the swords and the shields.
[123:49.32]Oh, wait.
[123:50.74]Wait.
[123:51.06]Okay, Game of Thrones.
[123:52.64]Alright, hold on.
[123:53.16]Game of Thrones before Season 7.
[123:54.66]Versus Star Wars.
[123:57.31]I don't know.
[123:57.59]I like that the swords have names and stuff.
[124:03.89]Finished level.
[124:04.63]Alright, hold on.
[124:05.15]Okay.
[124:13.97]So does Lord of the Rings.
[124:15.69]Yeah, they do.
[124:16.64]What?
[124:17.20]Yeah, that's true, but... Goblin Cleaver?
[124:20.24]Yeah, I don't know.
[124:24.72]Shit, this is... I don't know.
[124:25.78]I might be up in front of my own bullshit here because... The lightsabers don't have names.
[124:32.36]It's just light green lightsaber.
[124:36.13]It's not like... Sword of the Morning.
[124:40.11]It's just... Yellow lightsaber.
[124:48.81]Some do.
[124:49.29]Yeah, like two.
[124:51.13]Yeah, like the Darksaber, right?
[124:52.49]Okay, there's one.
[124:53.39]What, there's two others?
[124:58.10]Sorry.
[124:59.08]Out of like the 4,000 lightsabers that have been crafted from the fucking adamantite crystals, there's two that have names.
[125:14.36]Leia's Gonk Droid.
[125:15.32]Hold on, I don't know how to do that.
[125:21.65]The crystals have names.
[125:23.15]No, they don't.
[125:26.52]Yeah, it's called, like, the, what's it, the, what they called?
[125:31.00]Cyber Crystals?
[125:31.74]Cyber Crystals, Cyber Crystals, yeah.
[125:39.66]I didn't want to do that.
[125:41.02]Alright, here we go.
[125:41.96]Here comes the boss fight.
[125:43.06]The final boss of episode one.
[125:46.52]I had to do that, I'm sorry.
[125:49.18]Fake fan.
[125:49.78]Chaos Emeralds.
[125:50.70]Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[125:51.28]They're all the same thing.
[125:55.20]Don't be surprised, by the way, if in like three to five years, the Chaos Emeralds are turned into beam swords.
[126:02.60]Why the fuck not?
[126:03.62]It is a Sonic game.
[126:14.13]That would be actually pretty cool.
[126:15.25]Why have they not done that?
[126:18.63]Imagine a Sonic the Hedgehog game with lightsabers.
[126:22.71]It's Darth Vader.
[126:23.77]No, alright, he has the mustache on.
[126:25.04]It's Darth Maul.
[126:28.10]Here it comes.
[126:34.39]Look at us go.
[126:57.17]I want to be able to see their faces.
[126:58.55]Obi-Wan, no!
[127:13.30]That wasn't supposed to happen to you!
[127:14.90]That's supposed to happen to me!
[127:29.15]Oh shit.
[127:31.65]No!
[127:32.73]No!
[127:34.05]Obi-Wan!
[127:36.56]Well, I want to do that.
[127:37.28]Can I catch them in the air?
[127:46.14]Aha!
[127:47.28]I can do that too.
[127:49.91]Traitor.
[127:58.98]Oh, if I was a traitor, right?
[128:05.20]Traitor!
[128:06.78]I like this guy.
[128:07.32]Spin, spin, spin thing.
[128:08.28]Doing this wrong.
[128:22.51]What do I do about this?
[128:25.33]He blocks it.
[128:26.47]Oh, he's throwing.
[128:26.99]He has no hearts left.
[128:33.60]That's Count Dooku?
[128:34.94]Count Dooku.
[128:36.64]Join me.
[128:37.76]Join me, Link.
[128:38.92]And together we can destroy the Sith.
[128:42.62]I'll never join you.
[128:43.38]That's unfortunate.
[128:48.33]Now you will have to die.
[128:54.79]Fan fiction.
[129:01.23]I said Link.
[129:02.90]Yeah, I did say Link.
[129:07.93]And dude, in my fanfiction, Link talks?
[129:10.01]Are you fucking kidding me?
[129:21.66]Do you guys think they'll ever give Link dialog ever again?
[129:25.44]I don't think so.
[129:39.09]In that canister.
[129:41.15]Maybe.
[129:41.43]Why not?
[129:42.31]Maybe.
[129:43.29]It's probably going to.
[129:43.86]But it's going to have to be a celebrity.
[129:45.82]Let's be real.
[129:49.70]It's going to end up being Tom Holland.
[129:51.86]And you all know it.
[130:08.73]Wait, get in the car.
[130:14.68]Other side.
[130:15.10]Elijah Wood.
[130:17.44]Yeah, I can see that.
[130:23.14]I would... You know what?
[130:24.61]I'm... I wouldn't even be bad.
[130:26.29]That wouldn't even... I would be okay with that.
[130:28.59]That doesn't even... That would be alright, I think.
[130:32.51]I think that'd be fine.
[130:39.11]He's 40?
[130:39.51]Are we trying to say that... Are we questioning the talent of Elijah Wood?
[130:48.69]You're actually doing that right now.
[130:49.87]Are you sure you're doing that?
[130:53.27]We are right now questioning the talent of any age Elijah Wood.
[130:57.35]I need a stormtrooper to get up here.
[131:00.79]Alright, well, let's just walk over here.
[131:03.91]Yes, that's unbelievable to me.
[131:06.22]Alright, get him!
[131:18.72]I was trying to like murder him.
[131:26.84]You're an Elijah Wood simp.
[131:30.70]Oh, please.
[131:37.72]He's like a, he's like a wicked nice guy and he's really talented.
[131:41.69]Oh no, I can't believe you're simping for that guy.
[131:44.27]He's like a wicked good person.
[131:59.09]Oh, shit.
[131:59.85]This is bad.
[132:06.82]Face us.
[132:07.84]Wait, no, no, no.
[132:08.40]I want to change character.
[132:09.08]I don't want to be the one that gets... The one that goes shopping later.
[132:12.98]No, what the fuck?
[132:19.60]Why does the double jump doesn't work?
[132:23.22]Okay, I... Double jump doesn't work sometimes.
[132:27.49]Why would I work right there and not work here?
[132:31.61]Click, click.
[132:33.79]Alright, let's go, Obi-Wan.
[132:35.16]I mean, Qui-Gon.
[132:36.30]No, stop running away.
[132:42.08]That was... Wow.
[132:43.96]Did you guys like this game that much?
[132:45.94]That was very clearly a let's have a final boss fight here.
[132:48.94]And they took him away.
[132:49.90]They ran him away.
[132:59.71]That one song I'm gonna hear in my sleep.
[133:01.77]That din-din-di-di-din.
[133:18.16]Fuck.
[133:20.46]Qui-Gon!
[133:21.18]Help me!
[133:23.68]Qui-Gon!
[133:24.62]What the holy shit did we just got like the AI director that was like pissed we were taking too long.
[133:30.61]Hold him off.
[133:37.36]Spike.
[133:46.10]Wait, Qui-Gon fell off.
[134:03.67]Alright, you're toast, Darth Vader.
[134:05.69]Small.
[134:07.81]Oh, wait, this is the part where it goes.
[134:10.75]What are they actually saying?
[134:20.82]I've heard that song a thousand times.
[134:22.34]What are the lyrics to that song?
[134:30.18]It's gibberish.
[134:36.56]Wait, is it... It's actually just gibberish?
[134:39.33]They just go... They're not saying anything?
[134:50.20]No, that's not real.
[135:04.42]No, it's Latin?
[135:06.32]Wait, blue.
[135:10.48]What are they saying?
[135:11.28]Where's the other one?
[135:18.93]That's it?
[135:28.31]Wait, is this thing where it's like Lord of the Rings where they made up a whole language?
[135:31.05]Wait, can we fight him?
[135:34.80]No, wait.
[135:36.56]Wait, that doesn't... That's not how this happens in the movie.
[135:48.56]Yes, it is.
[135:49.04]Wait, no.
[135:49.52]How come we're both here?
[135:52.47]Let's change history then.
[136:05.06]Alright, but if you're playing with your little brother and he's playing Qui-Gon, because you don't want to play Qui-Gon for, you know, obvious reasons incoming, then what happens?
[136:12.66]Wouldn't the little brother be really sad?
[136:26.55]By the way, I feel bad for people that have never seen Star Wars and they're, like, just waiting for some reason and you're gonna see, like, the Lego version of, like, a major plot point of a movie.
[136:36.26]Okay, if you've held up for this long not watching Star Wars, you never were going to watch it, so who cares?
[136:46.92]Here we go.
[136:49.04]This is it.
[136:52.15]This is it.
[137:04.71]Good block.
[137:17.50]How do you swing?
[137:18.88]How do you swing?
[137:19.40]Click?
[137:19.76]Mouse?
[137:21.00]Enter.
[137:23.66]Spacebar.
[137:25.14]A. Z. Control.
[137:26.82]Shift.
[137:28.44]How do I swing with Qui- How do I swing with Qui-Gon?
[137:34.29]H. J. K. L.
[137:37.65]Semi.
[137:39.97]M. Period.
[137:41.79]Colon.
[137:42.43]Slash.
[137:44.14]Numpad.
[137:45.20]Numpad!
[137:51.20]Okay, this is hard to do this.
[137:52.84]They're fighting each other.
[138:07.37]Just like in the movie.
[138:09.89]We're getting an argument.
[138:10.88]Now, Obi-Wan, you... Leave me alone!
[138:19.48]Oh, shit.
[138:23.23]Spoilers.
[138:23.75]Yeah, you didn't remember this part.
[138:39.45]Get it Yeah, you guys don't remember the part where like Qui-Gon turns on Obi-Wan right here and he joins the Sith And then they have to battle it out And then dude Darth Maul breaks his double-sided lightsaber in half and hands the other side to Qui-Gon and they fucking both fight with a single saber dude
[139:12.17]I don't know how to do, um... Force pull with, uh... Oh, there we go.
[139:24.53]Thanks for saving me.
[139:30.43]He put his lightsaber away.
[139:38.76]Okay.
[139:42.27]Hold on a minute.
[139:43.05]I just lost something over here.
[139:53.01]Get him in the back.
[139:58.10]Oh.
[139:59.12]Oh.
[140:03.14]Oh.
[140:03.46]Oh.
[140:13.78]Am I alright?
[140:18.14]Wait, that doesn't happen.
[140:38.98]Ow!
[140:39.88]Ow, ow!
[140:40.78]That fucking hurts.
[140:49.33]Ah, I didn't expect it to be like that.
[140:52.37]His eyes go X and he just smashes his head on the star.
[140:56.85]I'm not a monster.
[140:57.73]It was unexpected and quick.
[141:02.29]It's fucking abrupt.
[141:03.47]That doesn't even happen in the movie.
[141:07.72]Why are you laughing?
[141:08.18]I'm not laughing at that!
[141:09.22]I'm laughing at... I'm laughing at the fact that it happened, not the fact that it was... I... Look, I'm laughing at the way that it happened, not the fact that it was sad that it happened.
[141:30.87]This is when we all get the medals, right?
[141:43.35]Oh, here it goes.
[141:45.93]That was very enjoyable.
[141:48.03]That was... Hold on a minute.
[141:50.81]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[141:57.74]That was like two hours long.
[142:02.66]Did this game come out on its own?
[142:10.70]No.
[142:11.88]1 to 3 did.
[142:12.72]Okay.
[142:15.81]Because I was going to say, if this was a standalone just video game, like the Phantom Menace that you bought at Walmart, I'm not sure you got your $60 worth.
[142:26.99]But it's three games.
[142:27.95]Okay.
[142:29.57]You guys know how the credits look.
[142:30.69]Who cares? 6.3%.
[142:42.02]Okay, so that was the Phantom Menace.
[142:49.24]Oh shit, how do I delete the second player?
[142:51.63]Drop out.
[142:52.01]Here we go.
[142:57.39]It was like 30 bucks.
[142:58.77]That's good.
[143:00.62]We need a link.
[143:01.46]Alright, hold on.
[143:01.94]I'm going to do a link and I'm going to go take this.
[143:13.54]Alright, what do you got?
[143:20.14]That's... I'm not going to click that.
[143:22.60]Well, I clicked it, but I'm not going to show that.
[143:24.46]And that's something I am not... There will be no comment.
[143:28.95]I'm going to have an emotionless comment on that image that I was just linked.
[143:35.87]Okay, so anything else you'd like me to see before I get out of here?
[143:43.20]Go to the bathroom.
[143:47.29]Okay, good.
[143:49.93]Like the fat face penis shirt thing, I've already linked it last night.
[144:01.79]This is a... Why do you have this picture?
[144:15.64]okay that's the pants that's the way the pants are that's like the pants like okay do you think I have like a hamburger dick please
[144:35.29]That's the pants, the way the zipper is pushed again.
[144:39.09]Larry David did an entire episode of his critically acclaimed, hilarious television show, Curb Your Enthusiasm, about this exact thing.
[144:49.88]I don't even need to describe this.
[144:53.12]It's a Larry David routine.
[144:54.72]So just go watch Curb Your Enthusiasm.
[144:59.77]I'll be right back.
[147:35.51]Does Jerma hate Adam Sandler?
[147:37.11]No.
[147:38.61]I actually think Uncut Gems is a really, really good movie, and I thought he was very good in it.
[147:42.89]I think Adam Sandler gets a lot of hate, doesn't get a lot of credit for some of the things that he's done.
[147:51.08]From the Saturday Night Live years through like the mid to late 90s, he made some really, really, actually really funny, talented, interesting things, and then he got a little complacent and made three or four real stinkers in a row.
[148:03.66]And then he got into some serious acting and I think he's pretty good.
[148:09.08]I think he gets too much hate for no reason.
[148:16.03]Well, no, hold on a minute.
[148:17.73]Yeah, he deserves quite a bit of criticism for like the five movies in a row that were like 10 on Rotten Tomatoes, right?
[148:32.19]It was a string of about six straight years, seven straight years, where almost everything he did was awful.
[148:40.11]Just awful, awful, awful.
[148:43.33]We talk about like the before times and then the after times of like the mid-2000s Adam Sandler disaster career.
[148:57.14]Duncacino.
[148:58.36]Dunca, dunca, dunca, dunca, duncacino.
[149:05.46]Don't give me that.
[149:06.78]Don't give me that.
[149:07.84]I saw it.
[149:08.38]People initially were very mad that I just did that.
[149:13.86]Let's get back to this.
[149:15.54]We're going to do episode two.
[149:18.26]Which is... Back of the Clones.
[149:23.08]Oh, wait.
[149:23.30]I have money to spend.
[149:26.12]Wait.
[149:26.56]This bot, right?
[149:31.97]He's so slow.
[149:32.65]I can't...
[149:54.30]Is Gonk an oven?
[149:59.72]What kind of droid is he?
[150:05.56]He's a trash can.
[150:06.58]Oh, okay.
[150:09.40]I knew he was something.
[150:13.30]When am I gonna get, like, some of the heavy hitters?
[150:14.80]Like, Palpatine.
[150:16.68]And, oh, wait, this is the prequel saga, right?
[150:19.20]Okay.
[150:20.52]Uh, I wanna buy some stuff.
[150:25.71]Phantom Menace.
[150:26.39]Wait, I can do whatever one I want?!
[150:27.85]I don't have to go in order?! !
[150:31.79]Oh, I gotta do- I'm gonna do my favorite Star Wars movie then.
[150:33.81]I don't have to- I didn't- I thought I had to go in order.
[150:35.33]Like, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[150:36.09]Did I watch the movies?
[150:37.15]Alright.
[150:37.41]Fuck the whole prequel trilogy.
[150:38.87]This thing- That stuff sucks.
[150:40.57]I wanna- Wait.
[150:41.91]I wanna do- Which one?
[150:52.89]Episode- Okay.
[150:54.63]Empire Strikes Back.
[150:56.95]Empire Strikes Back.
[151:01.64]By the way, I'm also not going to be one of those, like, haters that says that I actually enjoyed the prequel series for what it was.
[151:09.34]Sure, there was a lot of problems with it.
[151:11.26]But... I mean, it was... I thought it was okay.
[151:15.16]I thought it was... Look, they added some things.
[151:21.20]Broideca.
[151:22.06]Why did I just buy that for?
[151:25.24]Extra Toggle.
[151:26.20]What's that?
[151:27.40]Why am I buying these?
[151:28.24]What's an extra Toggle?
[151:39.91]Where's Droid Deca?
[151:43.41]I just bought it.
[151:52.62]Not Droid Deca.
[151:53.90]Where's Droid Deca?
[151:56.06]Start a bar fight.
[151:56.90]I did that in the very beginning and I caused a lot of problems.
[151:58.98]Alright, I'm going to do Empire Strikes Back.
[152:00.88]It's my favorite movie.
[152:02.30]This and Return of the Jedi are my favorites.
[152:05.06]Empire Strikes Back.
[152:05.68]I don't want to be Qui-Gon anymore.
[152:11.29]Make a custom character.
[152:12.45]How?
[152:16.27]Use the character creator.
[152:17.21]Wait, how?
[152:17.96]Where?
[152:20.00]How do I do that?
[152:21.56]Go back, go back, go back.
[152:22.36]Where?
[152:22.74]In here?
[152:23.02]Bonus.
[152:25.44]Bonus.
[152:32.47]What's bonus?
[152:33.13]Is this like deleted scenes?
[152:42.35]Back to the main place.
[152:45.23]It's in the cantina.
[152:47.83]Tube, guys, please.
[152:48.95]Tube, tube, tube.
[152:50.70]What's going on?
[152:51.22]Trailers?
[153:00.91]Is this a trailer for Indiana Jones?
[153:02.13]Indiana Jones, the game.
[153:04.10]Lego.
[153:04.40]I don't care about Indiana Jones at all.
[153:21.26]I really- Indiana Jones is now available to buy in the shop.
[153:24.80]You really gonna do that?
[153:26.44]I really- I have to be honest, I really don't care.
[153:28.52]Indiana Jones is like at the bottom of my interesting American cinematic trilogies.
[153:33.44]It- I just don't- I don't hate it, but I'm just not into it.
[153:39.54]Bathroom?
[153:41.40]Alright, get me out of here.
[153:46.23]Temple of Doom was awesome.
[153:51.33]Temple of Doom was crazy.
[153:54.39]But, I'm not a big fan of the other ones, really.
[154:04.66]It's the worst one.
[154:06.44]Is it?
[154:06.64]I think it's the only one I've watched.
[154:08.46]I just remember being like a little kid.
[154:18.71]How do I get out of here?
[154:20.63]I was like 12.
[154:22.52]And I remember there was a guy that pulled people's hearts out.
[154:24.94]And they ate animals' brains and stuff.
[154:27.52]And I remember being scared.
[154:29.00]Over here?
[154:42.49]Two-player arcade mode.
[154:44.43]Right, right, right, right, right, right.
[154:52.71]Question mark.
[154:58.75]Oh, look at this!
[155:07.23]I need... Okay, who do I want to be?
[155:09.88]Oh, definitely a slug guy.
[155:19.46]C-3PO...
[155:22.34]Now you're talking about fanfiction.
[155:24.82]That's... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[155:27.06]Definitely.
[155:28.52]I definitely want an R2-D2 Jedi.
[155:34.33]If I had my lightsaber, by the way, it would be white.
[155:39.59]It would be just white.
[155:41.25]Or... Yeah, it would be white.
[155:48.02]R2-D2 with a gun.
[155:52.19]Silver, yeah.
[155:52.95]Whatever it is.
[155:53.39]Well, it has to match him.
[155:56.29]Blue?
[155:56.39]This is just, like... This sucks.
[156:17.05]He's standing on two feet.
[156:21.62]Where's this droid body?
[156:22.62]Did I pass it?
[156:33.30]Okay.
[156:34.20]Stranger one.
[156:41.66]No hat.
[156:45.42]How do I take the hair off?
[156:51.96]What's going on?
[157:16.99]Gonk!
[157:17.43]Gonk!
[157:17.89]Gonk!
[157:18.37]Gonk!
[157:18.85]Gonk!
[157:19.35]Gonk!
[157:20.09]What?
[157:22.82]What is it?
[157:25.37]Okay, so how do I use them?
[157:29.25]Ow!
[157:37.09]Auto D2.
[157:37.75]Alright, this is a good link.
[157:38.83]You're right.
[157:46.41]You have to do it in free play?
[157:47.81]Oh.
[157:50.80]Auto D2.
[157:54.03]That's who is inside of the case.
[157:57.45]That's very cute.
[157:58.05]Alright, so I can't use them in the story.
[158:02.13]Fine.
[158:02.55]Alright, I want to do episode 5.
[158:04.88]Let's go.
[158:07.74]Empire Strikes Back.
[158:08.52]I didn't know everyone was going to call me a Reddit normie for saying that this is one of my favorite movies in the franchise.
[158:15.56]Sure.
[158:16.30]Go for it.
[158:24.97]Return of the Jedi is probably my actual favorite one.
[158:41.38]Is it dark?
[158:42.38]You guys know the story.
[158:47.24]For a second I forgot what game I was playing.
[158:48.96]I just knew it was Star Wars and I saw how weird polygon looking that ship was and I thought something was wrong with the computer.
[159:02.45]Use the Force, Luke.
[159:05.97]I'm also one of those weirdos that didn't hate The Force Awakens.
[159:09.19]I wouldn't say it was my favorite, but I didn't hate it.
[159:25.68]Why don't I get to do that part?
[159:29.52]I don't get to do that part?
[159:30.90]That part's awesome.
[159:38.82]They're all good.
[159:46.45]He's Darth Vader Simlish.
[159:50.65]I love it.
[160:00.04]Uh, nah, I think, I mean, here's the thing about Star Wars, it's such a beloved franchise and everybody loves it.
[160:04.73]And everybody is like, oh, it's the best thing ever.
[160:07.05]But, let's be really honest.
[160:09.11]Like, probably half of these movies are not very good.
[160:18.32]The other half, though, they're fantastic.
[160:21.16]Like, fan-fucking-tastic.
[160:24.94]Oh, shit.
[160:27.00]That's B to use your toe cable.
[160:31.33]This one is awesome so far.
[160:36.57]Okay, well, you can do it on the AT-ATs, right?
[160:45.87]Ow.
[160:47.37]Out of bounds?
[160:51.30]Luke!
[160:51.78]Luke, stop doing tricks!
[160:53.98]And focus on the enemies!
[161:04.33]This is where Luke gets way too over-competent and he just lets his force powers do it because he can just do anything he wants.
[161:10.97]He's like cheating in the lobby at this point.
[161:24.09]V.A.C.
[161:30.72]How do I get rid of this?
[161:32.52]I need a tie fighter to open this?
[161:35.18]Oh, Luke.
[161:40.06]Why are you doing Peter Griffin?
[161:43.64]Peter Griffin?
[161:44.20]What are you talking about?
[161:46.94]I did?
[161:47.38]When did I do my Peter Griffin?
[161:51.68]I have to do that to ten of these.
[162:00.62]Wait, we're fighting over the bomb.
[162:16.98]Who's gonna get it?
[162:21.66]What do I do with that?
[162:22.16]I gotta throw it in there.
[162:22.84]Alright, throw the bomb.
[162:36.90]Wrong way.
[162:43.73]Wrong place.
[162:48.89]There it is.
[162:49.71]Throw it in.
[162:55.44]This is literally a kid's game.
[162:56.94]Yeah, I know.
[162:57.78]I've never played it though.
[162:58.88]You've played this game like a thousand times when you were a little kid.
[163:01.26]I didn't play it.
[163:08.95]Dropped him.
[163:20.38]I was 20 when this came out.
[163:23.08]When did this come out?
[163:25.85]This is pretty old, doesn't it?
[163:29.03]Are you as old as me?
[163:29.77]How old are you?
[163:32.43]When did this come out?
[163:41.79]When did this actually come out?
[163:46.84]Okay, did I do it?
[163:51.46]2007, that's not that long ago.
[163:55.07]2009 that's not that long ago at all.
[163:56.46]I never mind.
[163:58.54]I don't know why I thought this game came out in like 2000 Um grab the bomb
[164:27.68]Uh, what?
[164:28.06]I don't understand.
[164:38.10]This is just like Tony Hawk.
[164:50.98]Ow!
[164:51.12]Alright, wrap him up.
[164:55.79]Let's go.
[164:57.61]Prove to everybody why you're my favorite movie.
[165:04.69]Boom.
[165:04.83]Come on.
[165:08.55]Slice.
[165:08.91]Blow it up.
[165:13.54]Blow him up.
[165:14.78]No, get out of the fucking way.
[165:20.74]There it is.
[165:24.25]Alright, that's another one dead.
[165:25.09]How many more of these do I have to kill?
[165:30.20]Somebody said this sucks.
[165:33.72]It doesn't suck.
[165:41.31]Alright, roll it in.
[165:48.94]This is vomiting.
[166:06.34]Hold on.
[166:07.56]This voice.
[166:10.99]Don't make me laugh.
[166:11.71]Actually, now that you said that, why did you say that?
[166:17.59]How am I going to get sick?
[166:18.61]Don't say that out loud.
[166:21.25]Actually, now I'm going to puke because you said that.
[166:22.99]I was fine until you said that.
[166:43.65]Okay, yeah.
[166:44.79]Get up there.
[166:52.90]Shit, why did you say that?
[166:57.56]I think we're good.
[166:59.35]Yup.
[166:59.59]Alright, we're fine.
[167:00.63]Wait, what?
[167:01.93]Oh!
[167:10.48]Go up the ramp, Whoppercock.
[167:25.10]Okay.
[167:29.78]Destroy all the little droids.
[167:39.88]One more.
[167:47.65]Kill it!
[167:49.10]Kill it!
[167:51.44]Alright, now what?
[167:54.58]Now I gotta blow something up.
[167:55.90]Please stop moving for a second.
[168:01.46]I'm gonna vomit.
[168:02.46]What should I have for food today?
[168:04.24]I know that's a weird transition, but what should I eat today?
[168:18.79]A Whopper?
[168:21.01]No, Bird King sucks.
[168:24.15]It just does.
[168:27.88]Bird King just, it's not, it used to be good.
[168:31.30]It really did.
[168:31.88]That, you know, maybe like 10 years ago, I would have agreed with you and said, yeah, I'm going to go get a Whopper.
[168:38.05]Or like a, like a Stacker, like a BK Stacker.
[168:40.15]That was my favorite.
[168:41.81]BK Stacker with a Stacker Sauce.
[168:45.27]Then everything you ordered from Burger King as of five years ago was cold.
[168:49.44]What happened?
[168:49.82]Did they just get rid of their microwaves?
[168:51.56]Did they get rid of their heaters?
[168:57.96]I have not had hot food from Burger King in five years.
[169:01.46]That's an accurate, actual statement.
[169:03.26]I have not.
[169:05.44]I haven't been there, granted, for very many times.
[169:08.46]But the times that I have been there, it has never been even warm.
[169:13.08]I don't know why that is.
[169:18.51]Now, that happens at McDonald's.
[169:20.79]Not frequently, but it does.
[169:22.07]But not to the extent that I saw at Ed Burger King.
[169:29.14]Define hot.
[169:30.50]Um, well, okay.
[169:31.38]Let me think about this.
[169:34.26]Okay, if you put your hand, like, on your ass right now.
[169:44.14]The heat, like, coming off your ass right now.
[169:47.27]I would consider that, like, McDonald's, like, warm.
[169:52.57]Like, that's, like, fast food warm to me.
[169:55.45]Like, put your hand on, like, your belly.
[169:57.27]Like, on your stomach.
[169:58.47]Just hold it there for a second.
[169:59.37]That's, like, okay, like, when you feel the burger in the wrapper.
[170:01.53]That's edible.
[170:02.57]That's edible.
[170:03.01]That's, like, kind of hot.
[170:17.52]Do I kill these things?
[170:18.56]What the fuck are you talking about?
[170:36.71]Like lukewarm.
[170:37.35]Slightly warmer than room temperature is how a lot of fast food comes.
[170:49.40]You just made thousands of people... You just made thousands of people touch their ass.
[170:54.95]Well, no.
[170:55.41]I just mean like your body heat.
[170:58.93]Body heat is like a respectable fast food heat.
[171:03.55]I'm okay with that.
[171:15.85]I'm not touching that.
[171:17.83]My ass is not wrapped up in a hamburger.
[171:21.03]It's a plastic fun thing.
[171:22.41]Like, my ass is not... Your ass is not... You're not going to eat your ass in a wrapper.
[171:43.95]Okay.
[171:50.15]Before he gets up, come on.
[171:53.53]This man can't beat a children's game.
[171:55.07]Do you see how much chaos is happening on the screen right now?
[172:13.68]Even more of these?
[172:14.54]Alright, let's get the big guy first.
[172:21.26]Wait, clear it out.
[172:27.62]Big guy first, go.
[172:28.30]Fucking read the screen.
[172:35.21]I'm getting rid of the big guy first.
[172:36.91]I can see the icons.
[172:38.57]What are you talking about?
[172:48.65]Shit, this is no longer my favorite movie.
[172:52.20]It's not my favorite movie anymore.
[172:57.38]Oh, give me a break.
[172:58.26]Come on.
[173:07.48]Okay, I got it.
[173:08.44]You can't die in this game.
[173:09.40]Who cares?
[173:25.71]Star Wars diaper check?
[173:28.21]It's not full.
[173:30.36]What?
[173:31.34]What's wrong with me today?
[173:35.70]What am I doing?
[173:36.40]Why am I saying these things?
[173:51.43]No!
[173:57.81]You're a piss baby.
[173:58.57]Okay, I thought that was a lightsaber.
[174:05.74]And I was going to say, that's a very strange lightsaber.
[174:16.93]Hey, you little piss babies.
[174:25.41]Alright, did it.
[174:26.21]2%.
[174:26.23]10 out of 160.
[174:52.91]There's a lot... This... You know what?
[174:54.63]This is a cool game.
[174:56.71]Now I understand why this won the 2.5 billion dollar erasure screen.
[175:02.87]I get it now.
[175:03.27]This is why you wanted me to play this so bad.
[175:07.43]Empire Strikes Back.
[175:17.11]Escape from Echo Base.
[175:20.12]Oh shit, we're on the ground now.
[175:31.45]Links are now accepted.
[175:32.67]Well, not yet.
[175:33.85]Let me get to an episode after this.
[175:41.72]By the way, what's up?
[175:43.26]They're like brother and sister, right?
[175:44.76]And like, well, we're like in love.
[175:49.22]It's fucking weird.
[175:57.25]Oh, it's Han Solo.
[175:58.67]Oh.
[176:01.27]This is not Luke.
[176:02.81]I thought it was Han Solo.
[176:04.27]No, I thought... Favorite movie.
[176:10.25]Yeah, but I like... I don't know.
[176:11.43]Whatever.
[176:14.12]It looks like Luke.
[176:15.04]It could be... Look, it could be... I haven't seen the movie.
[176:17.96]I haven't seen the... I've not seen this movie in probably 10 to 15 years at least.
[176:30.30]Who can open this?
[176:30.86]I don't know what to do.
[176:32.32]Can we play Battleship?
[176:34.38]I'm thinking of Battleship.
[176:38.82]What a fucking Pog game that is.
[176:40.22]Nobody plays it anymore.
[176:48.39]Have you guys noticed that Battleship is not cool anymore?
[176:53.43]Nobody plays it when it's like one of the most interesting games.
[176:55.85]You know what I really, really, really hope to God happens.
[176:58.27]And I'll be the one to start it if I have to.
[177:01.21]You know how like Chess took over Twitch?
[177:02.69]Or like Among Us took over Twitch?
[177:04.09]When is Battleship gonna take over Twitch and be a huge thing?
[177:08.43]I'll do it.
[177:17.62]And actually, I'm very happy that Chess got very popular.
[177:20.86]Because that's a game, that's a game for brains.
[177:26.25]And it's really interesting.
[177:44.26]Where do I go?
[177:49.65]I can't pick up the... I cannot pick up, like, the Sesame Street play telephone machine thing.
[177:55.93]What do I do?
[177:58.96]Build.
[177:59.36]Build Legos.
[178:00.06]What?
[178:00.24]What?
[178:00.46]I didn't know I could take... What?
[178:07.14]I thought it was just... Whatever.
[178:08.89]So...
[178:17.91]Let's go.
[178:27.92]Build, build, build.
[178:34.38]What do we go from here?
[178:35.08]Oh, one, two, three.
[178:39.39]It's a metal melter.
[178:43.78]How come there's been no Star Wars RTS game with Jedi and stuff?
[178:47.54]Has there been?
[178:54.05]There was?
[178:54.45]Well, what happened to it?
[178:55.03]It's been multiple.
[179:04.62]It exists.
[179:07.30]Yes.
[179:13.66]Did it age well?
[179:15.46]It's still good shit, is it really?
[179:16.76]People still play it.
[179:22.06]Yeah, I... Maybe I'll play it.
[179:26.17]Does it run on new hardware?
[179:39.25]It's on Steam.
[179:39.99]Is it really?
[179:44.02]I have to check this out.
[179:57.15]Ah, I missed a blue.
[180:07.46]Offscreen.
[180:08.58]Can't even get me.
[180:15.53]Rebuild it.
[180:16.67]Wait, get the blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.
[180:21.87]Esports.
[180:22.61]Cheater.
[180:22.91]Alright, I'll get the right side.
[180:28.18]You get the left side.
[180:28.76]Leia.
[180:31.14]Left side.
[180:34.76]I think we just move.
[180:39.77]Rebuild.
[180:44.96]Barrier.
[180:45.42]Barrier activated.
[180:46.52]Barrier online.
[180:50.94]Why did you say that?
[180:52.16]Barrier?
[180:52.56]That was an Overwatch joke?
[181:08.38]Well, it wasn't an Overwatch joke.
[181:09.62]It was just I said a thing from Overwatch.
[181:13.90]If I was an Overwatch dog, do you think I would have been like, hey, remember in Overwatch when, like, McCree goes like, I just said they were lying.
[181:20.06]It didn't do anything.
[181:27.17]What does this do?
[181:31.39]Oh, sick.
[181:31.75]I thought that was Worf.
[181:39.24]From Star Trek?
[181:55.84]Oh, C-3PO.
[181:58.24]Finally.
[181:58.64]You look dead.
[182:05.79]Skeletons in a kid's game?
[182:07.21]What the heck?
[182:09.67]Alright, we need another person.
[182:11.36]Where's another person?
[182:12.48]Where's the next person?
[182:13.72]I'm missing somebody.
[182:28.77]Wait, can C-3PO open this?
[182:32.01]C-3PO, come here!
[182:36.28]Okay, that's the button.
[182:37.12]What happened to him?
[182:43.12]Oh, shit.
[182:47.97]He can't control that?
[182:48.79]Move!
[182:57.73]Alright, get that door open.
[183:08.53]Wait, okay, I was gonna say, he doesn't have any hands.
[183:10.19]Can he open it?
[183:18.26]This is kind of... This is sad.
[183:20.12]Can we get him his body parts back?
[183:25.06]Uh-oh.
[183:32.43]It's an ambush!
[183:42.35]You did this.
[183:45.32]But I will deny that I did.
[183:46.38]Alright, rebuild.
[184:00.15]Somebody get on that gun.
[184:07.55]What do we do?
[184:08.35]Oh, I need the Jedi for this in free play.
[184:22.23]And his suffering, no.
[184:25.47]Oh wait, coins.
[184:36.73]Move.
[184:40.45]Coins.
[184:45.21]They did a good job with this game.
[184:47.28]That's good.
[184:47.84]I like it.
[184:59.21]Yeah, they're those little buttons.
[185:00.61]Doesn't this make you just want to buy a big Lego set?
[185:07.96]Dump it out on the counter.
[185:10.87]Look at it for a few minutes and look at the instructions.
[185:12.98]And then put it all back in the container and put it in the closet and never open it again.
[185:16.10]What happened to... Oh.
[185:28.85]I gotta break that.
[185:34.13]Wait, give me this.
[185:36.56]This makes me want to play Luigi's Mansion 3.
[185:49.63]Did you guys watch that?
[185:50.37]Alright, one in the chat if you would actually watch me play Luigi's Mansion 3.
[185:54.48]And I think that would be like a PogChamp stream.
[185:56.38]Alright, let's go.
[186:09.82]Play the first one instead.
[186:12.14]Yeah.
[186:17.01]It's not very pog.
[186:18.59]Really.
[186:30.09]Damn.
[186:30.43]Adaptive difficulty.
[186:32.12]What's going on here?
[186:32.80]Let's get out of here.
[186:37.62]Let's get together.
[186:45.20]I love the first one so much.
[186:48.12]Alright, forward Nintendo Switch week.
[186:51.30]That's something that I should do.
[186:53.22]How do I get him up?
[186:59.16]How do I get C-3PO up there?
[187:02.97]Is it like his own little car?
[187:14.15]Wait, he has his own little car!
[187:19.31]Wait, C-3PO, come here!
[187:29.85]Oh, wait, I'll just... Where'd he go?
[187:47.20]Is he up?
[187:47.66]Oh.
[188:04.51]Play Mario.
[188:04.93]Yeah, this is going to be a Mario week.
[188:07.00]I'm going to play Mario.
[188:08.94]Paper Mario.
[188:09.58]Super Paper Mario.
[188:10.16]I'm going to play Mario Galaxy 2.
[188:13.02]Never played that before.
[188:18.75]Mario Odyssey.
[188:19.25]I'm going to play Mario Odyssey as well.
[188:20.69]That's another one that you'll see probably pretty soon here.
[188:23.99]We'll go through all the good Switch catalog.
[188:26.65]Games that I never really got to.
[188:27.69]Hold on.
[188:32.42]That's a lot of blues over there.
[188:37.76]I played Mario Maker.
[188:38.56]I played Mario Maker 1 and 2.
[188:41.27]Oh, what?
[188:43.81]I also want to do Mario 64 slide levels.
[188:47.03]Heard that exists as well.
[188:50.39]Do I have to jump on these?
[189:02.62]I got one.
[189:03.12]I have the same anger in Mario RPG when you try to get the frog coins in the river.
[189:14.02]What about Zelda?
[189:16.10]I don't know about Zelda.
[189:21.91]I never was a big fan of Zelda.
[189:29.97]I liked Ocarina of Time.
[189:31.89]That's...
[189:33.61]That's kind of it.
[189:36.05]Is this a dive?
[189:40.37]I'm just losing them as I get them.
[190:04.62]I'm trying to touch the button.
[190:11.96]No, it's a lot harder than it looks.
[190:13.30]It's not very much handling power here.
[190:29.99]It's a children's game.
[190:31.77]It doesn't mean it's not designed to do more.
[190:35.51]Sit down.
[190:41.29]Who said sit down?
[190:48.46]Shit.
[191:00.87]RTX on.
[191:04.52]I love this company.
[191:07.46]Yes!
[191:23.79]Got it.
[191:26.23]Step on it, please.
[191:29.68]Developers, developers, developers, developers, developers, developers, developers, developers, developers.
[191:38.93]I miss like the meme ability of Steve Ballmer.
[191:47.63]Oh, it's Chewbacca!
[191:53.41]Chewie!
[191:56.95]Chewie!
[192:05.20]Is it weird that Han Solo's Chewie has the same energy as Walter White's Jesse?
[192:23.25]They're both sidekicks.
[192:24.55]Yeah, I guess that's true.
[192:30.77]Somebody step on the other one.
[192:33.04]Chewie, we have to cook.
[192:34.86]Yeah.
[192:38.77]Oh, over here.
[192:40.09]No, no, no.
[192:40.37]Don't block it off.
[192:41.65]Don't ruin it.
[192:42.27]Good.
[192:48.21]Now I see why co-op with this game makes a lot of sense considering that there's a lot of things that would go faster with two people.
[193:00.79]Wait, what?
[193:03.38]Points.
[193:11.99]Don't block it in the... I did it.
[193:13.97]I ruined it.
[193:14.34]No, I didn't.
[193:16.02]Do we get mounts?
[193:29.56]Is this a switch?
[193:35.66]All characters except droids can ride creatures.
[193:41.70]This is awesome.
[193:42.46]Do they have an attack?
[193:46.54]You can jump super high off of them.
[193:52.95]It's a 1% drop.
[193:57.45]Dude, I got it.
[193:59.33]It only took me 7,000 attempts.
[194:00.27]Turn it off.
[194:13.17]How do I turn this shit up?
[194:13.89]Something weird that I have to do here?
[194:22.48]Oh, just destroy.
[194:23.44]He didn't move.
[194:27.26]Your own fault.
[194:27.72]Alright, get on the mount.
[194:37.35]Can't fight on the mount.
[194:39.21]Wait, Chewbacca can rip their limbs off?
[194:43.76]That's a little morbid, don't you think?
[194:49.59]Did he do that in the movie?
[195:03.18]Alright, somebody came down.
[195:11.05]It's referenced in episode four.
[195:14.17]Oh, that's a neat little Easter egg.
[195:15.56]Can we get in this?
[195:39.19]This is the Millennium Falcon.
[195:41.77]How do I activate it?
[195:49.07]Ah!
[195:51.07]Protect me!
[195:53.83]Shit's ready to go!
[195:54.41]Uh-oh, there he is.
[196:03.36]This is where Obi-Wan and him... No, that's another one.
[196:09.39]I keep thinking that's Luke.
[196:17.19]I'm just like, what are they?
[196:18.55]Oh.
[196:30.88]Level complete.
[196:32.46]Yes.
[196:36.35]You unlocked Han Solo.
[196:38.73]Princess Leia.
[196:41.57]C-3PO.
[196:44.65]Chewbacca.
[196:50.04]Are you a true Jedi?
[196:51.86]No.
[196:53.64]Is Kit Vista in the game?
[196:54.64]Is he actually unlockable?
[197:05.21]Not that I care that much, but I do.
[197:10.45]Play episode 3.
[197:12.27]Episode 3, episode 3, episode 3.
[197:15.42]Go to episode 2 and 3.
[197:20.06]Hold on, I'm like halfway through Hoth.
[197:34.95]Stop being so Hawthorne.
[197:36.39]Am I flying this?
[197:47.87]Where am I?
[197:51.38]Alright, gotta get 16 lasers.
[197:53.24]I just read that in the chat.
[197:54.52]Somebody said that.
[198:03.44]That's what really would happen.
[198:06.12]Doesn't matter how good of a pilot you are, when there's like 6,000 ships shooting in random directions, you're going to explode.
[198:23.09]Wait, is that a true Mega Lull right there?
[198:24.91]A Darth Vader theme song.
[198:39.11]Only four more were there.
[198:44.80]Last ones over here.
[198:53.16]There's a 34 by the way.
[198:54.38]I know how old I am.
[198:55.22]Don't have to remind me.
[199:04.00]Where we off to?
[199:04.88]Alright.
[199:10.64]That doesn't really even look like Chewbacca.
[199:12.02]That looks like Cousin It from... ...Adam's Family.
[199:25.07]Alright, just dodge the asteroid.
[199:29.49]Watch out for that asteroid!
[199:46.85]Right now inside of this ship.
[199:49.68]Everybody is fucking throwing up.
[199:52.88]People's organs are out of their mouths.
[199:59.47]Even just doing that.
[200:00.17]How do I blow this up?
[200:09.42]Zero gravity?
[200:10.88]Doesn't matter.
[200:41.84]There are bombs to get.
[200:42.98]Apparently.
[200:53.11]How do I collect them?
[201:01.21]Any button?
[201:11.33]Oh.
[201:26.73]Give me it!
[201:33.57]Eat shit!
[201:35.43]What?!
[201:36.63]Oh, okay, it worked.
[201:50.98]It's hard to control.
[202:15.81]This is too intense for a kid's game.
[202:17.39]There's violence in this, you're right.
[202:20.30]There's violence in this.
[202:23.48]No violence in my kid's game.
[202:27.40]The only violence that I want is my kid's programming.
[202:32.07]This daffy duck getting his face blown off by a shotgun.
[202:47.07]I'm gonna have to do that again.
[202:49.88]Alright, I'm gonna try to collect like a few of them.
[202:55.56]That's two right there.
[202:56.36]Alright, let's go!
[202:59.04]Fuck.
[202:59.26]Can I get them back?
[203:03.01]I can't get them back.
[203:03.67]A lot of space missions in this one, not enough lightsaber fighting.
[203:14.12]That's why Return of the Jedi is better, because there's way more lightsaber fights.
[203:22.93]That's how I determine how good of a Star Wars movie it is.
[203:26.85]By how many actual lightsaber fights there are.
[203:37.16]And you love Episode 3.
[203:39.20]Yup.
[203:46.36]And again, let's be honest with the franchise.
[203:50.87]The lightsabers are the only thing holding this thing together.
[203:53.13]Without the lightsaber sound effects, no one cares.
[203:58.97]What about the Mandalorian?
[204:19.55]Yes, I stopped caring about the Mandalorian after the fourth episode.
[204:23.86]Case in point.
[204:34.92]And then I picked it back up again.
[204:36.36]Did I just die?
[204:37.14]Oh no.
[204:45.16]Episode 1, 2, 3.
[204:45.92]I was like, alright, I'm into this.
[204:47.84]This is pretty cool.
[204:50.18]Soundtrack is incredible from the Mandalorian to get one of the best theme songs of any new show in a very long time But I have to like episode 5 they were just doing the same thing over and over again There's no lightsaber fight This is double score zone
[205:22.47]Better leave?
[205:31.42]Oh shit, I got him!
[205:35.92]I liked the Mandalorian.
[205:39.33]I didn't love it.
[205:41.85]I really enjoyed the first half.
[205:51.49]If I can get more of those bombs.
[206:00.62]Episode 7 and 8 are the best.
[206:07.56]Episode 2 is the best.
[206:16.20]Season 2 is really good.
[206:18.68]Should I give him more of a chance?
[206:29.86]I'm seeing a lot of no's.
[206:35.77]Did I just shot- I got shot in the mid-air.
[206:38.89]Wait, there's one right- there's something to blow up right here.
[206:43.21]Secret!
[206:43.57]Let's see what my dog does when I give him a bone.
[207:10.78]Hey, remember when I said that I think that the Mandalorian is like the best new Star Wars content in a decade?
[207:18.46]Remember when I said that?
[207:21.12]I said that, like after the first two or three episodes.
[207:27.84]I just lost interest.
[207:28.84]I just did.
[207:30.00]I just lost interest.
[207:31.00]I wasn't like, oh, the socks, not enough lightsabers, not enough of this, not enough of that.
[207:36.14]No, I just lost interest.
[207:44.90]Man, the Millennium Falcon sure has a lot of lives.
[208:00.69]Lightsabers are dumb.
[208:01.96]They are not.
[208:02.88]You like them.
[208:06.00]You're up gaslighting yourself.
[208:23.16]I do love the... You guys are telling me that I don't watch the Mandalorian and I just don't... I did the... You don't know what that is?
[208:45.11]That I'm the one that lost interest?
[208:48.53]Unbelievable.
[209:00.66]That was sort of yes, I apologize that was kind of Peter Griffin And
[209:29.71]Stop talking over cutscenes.
[209:33.53]Oh, whatever.
[209:44.00]We saw Baby Yoda on your Reddit shelf.
[209:52.32]I like Baby Yoda.
[210:03.77]Reddit shelf, Reddit shelf.
[210:04.93]Oh, Normie.
[210:05.59]Now all of a sudden I'm a Normie.
[210:06.57]Oh, I like Mandalorian.
[210:08.95]I lost interest in the Mandalorian.
[210:11.56]What the fuck?
[210:12.70]Fuck you.
[210:13.86]What are you, stupid?
[210:16.18]I think Baby Yoda was really cute and fun.
[210:19.30]Normie, Reddit shelf user.
[210:22.66]We've got a Normie.
[210:35.32]normie alert So if I don't like the Mandalorian, I'm an asshole, but if I do if I love the Mandalorian, I'm a normie Is there a middle ground?
[210:55.66]This guy likes Home Alone 2.
[210:57.11]I love Home Alone 2.
[210:58.27]I love both Home Alones.
[210:59.29]I think they're fantastic.
[211:00.73]I would love to watch them on stream if I was allowed to.
[211:03.98]They're required reading for this stream.
[211:07.08]Home Alone 1 and Home Alone 2 are required reading for this stream.
[211:10.30]If you haven't seen them, you have to go watch them.
[211:22.71]Home Alone 2 is terrible?
[211:24.51]No, I mean, it's not as good as Home Alone 1.
[211:31.79]Just like Gremlins, and especially Gremlins 2 is required reading on this stream.
[211:37.90]If you do not like Gremlins 2 and you are watching this stream right now, and you're like here, I can't believe that.
[211:46.55]There's no way I can believe that.
[211:53.69]When, like, Hulk Hogan comes and, like, tells, like, the Gremlins when he's in the movie theater, like, cut the shit because they fuck him with a projector.
[212:01.47]How could you not like that?
[212:02.91]It's, like, it's hysterical.
[212:13.82]You ruined it.
[212:16.28]That's, like, one of 5,000 gags that are in that movie.
[212:25.35]I'm not a powerful force user yet.
[212:26.61]I can't lift this up.
[212:43.23]Was that a bat?
[212:50.11]I kind of like this level.
[212:50.83]I like the scenery.
[212:58.29]We're about to meet Yoda.
[213:01.59]That's not Yoda, by the way, if you're curious.
[213:04.98]That's Yoda's, like, goofy cousin.
[213:12.15]He was like a tax accountant or something.
[213:27.82]Wait, can I get that?
[213:31.31]Dove headfirst into the poison.
[213:33.63]Wait, R2!
[213:37.41]R2, can you get that?
[213:46.14]You can't.
[213:57.22]That sounded like it was starting.
[214:05.67]Where do I go?
[214:07.99]Wait, Yoda, go get that.
[214:13.79]Yoda, you have to be able to do something.
[214:23.98]Not Yoda.
[214:25.98]R2-D2.
[214:29.18]What am I supposed to do?
[214:40.83]R2-D2 can hover?
[214:43.39]You know, I don't know that because I didn't play for more than five seconds with R2-D2.
[214:46.77]Okay, good.
[214:49.11]Good to know.
[214:53.46]His favorite franchise.
[214:54.58]No, I didn't say that was my favorite franchise.
[214:56.54]Did I?
[215:14.55]What is my favorite franchise?
[215:16.37]Uh...
[215:26.71]Diners, drive-ins, and dives?
[215:30.47]Come here.
[215:36.41]Nice.
[215:42.25]Da-da-da.
[215:57.10]Classic song.
[215:57.76]This is the Luke theme.
[215:59.16]You know, I was in the theater and they played Luke's theme.
[216:10.78]Just started fucking screaming.
[216:29.09]He's just giggling.
[216:30.01]It's Mr. Bean.
[216:30.45]Mr. Bean.
[217:07.76]What the hell?
[217:08.58]Am I supposed to do that?
[217:12.09]Wait, fix this.
[217:20.39]If you want to know my secrets, kill that droid that you're with.
[217:26.08]I can't.
[217:26.52]He's R2.
[217:26.90]You won't be learning anything then.
[217:30.04]I'm sorry, dude.
[217:46.63]What is he teaching me?
[217:49.80]How to lift up things?
[217:50.60]I'm not strong enough.
[218:03.96]What is he doing?
[218:04.70]I don't know how to do math anymore.
[218:14.38]I think I stole that from somewhere.
[218:24.15]Where'd I steal that from?
[218:35.29]Me.
[218:38.77]This Family Guy when Chris sticks an army figurine up his nose.
[218:56.27]Okay, so those of you guys that didn't see this, I'm just gonna say it because I find it to be... ...honey, and I don't care if nobody else does.
[219:07.08]In pre-stream chat one time, we talked about doing Family Dinner 2.
[219:10.08]But the only difference was, it was just me and a bunch of actors dressed up as Family Guy characters, and I was Peter.
[219:19.26]And it wasn't even me, it was just the Family Dinner, but we were just doing Family Guy.
[219:25.39]And there would be, like, pre-recorded videos of, like, cutbacks, reference callbacks to, like, cutaways.
[219:32.46]It would just be the same thing, like, Family Dinner 2.
[219:35.40]It's still us, but we're also kind of like the Griffin family.
[219:40.22]And it would be unbearable for you for, like, fucking two or three hours.
[219:43.38]And we'd just be like, oh, that reminds me of the time!
[219:48.95]Like, it would be me as Peter Griffin.
[219:50.35]But it's me.
[219:51.11]I'm not actually being Peter Griffin.
[219:53.17]I'm Jeremy Elbertson.
[219:59.15]I got real close to pulling trigger on that one.
[220:05.91]Alright, Yoda, come here.
[220:13.18]Did Yoda just kill me?
[220:14.30]Oh.
[220:14.76]Alright, Yoda, come here.
[220:19.10]Get on me.
[220:19.36]Can we fly?
[220:24.83]Wait, I have Yoda's... Okay, when I wear Yoda on my head, I get extra power.
[220:28.47]He's like a... He's like wearing a piece of tinfoil.
[220:30.83]He's like an antenna.
[220:37.83]Yoda, can you move like a little to the left?
[220:44.14]How do I... How do I do anything?
[220:55.98]Not even my favorite movie anymore.
[221:03.79]Can we touch this?
[221:17.41]Why would they have bats in there?
[221:18.75]Why would you keep bats in here?
[221:26.74]R2 can fly.
[221:27.50]Yeah, I know R2 can fly, but... I mean... How... That seems like too far for him to go.
[221:37.47]Wait, he can... He doesn't die from the poison.
[221:43.94]God.
[221:54.32]I'm gonna get copystriked.
[222:08.65]Whatever, I'm not gonna get copystriked.
[222:11.90]For humming the Mandalorian theme song.
[222:29.96]He's humming a song.
[222:36.22]Don't ever listen to the radio ever again.
[222:42.61]Listening to the radio is illegal.
[222:43.99]Alright, I got it.
[223:02.98]Faced and poopy pilt.
[223:06.85]Thanks, I guess.
[223:12.71]Well, how do we get over there now?
[223:14.05]Wait, what?
[223:16.31]R2, you didn't even do anything.
[223:17.17]You just gave us...
[223:27.44]Get off me.
[223:29.40]Oh, shit.
[223:30.18]Just killed Yoda.
[223:32.68]Oh, Yoda, I'm sorry.
[223:34.00]Yoda!
[223:37.04]Never-ending, like, torture device for Yoda.
[223:44.78]I'll help you.
[223:45.92]I'll get you up.
[223:46.60]Just grab my hand.
[223:50.30]Um, I don't think... I don't think I can actually help him.
[223:55.70]Help him, R2!
[223:57.74]Get in the way so he bounces off of you.
[224:02.82]Shit.
[224:04.61]How did I get softlocked in this game?
[224:06.55]I don't understand.
[224:10.75]If I run too far away, he won't... He'll have to get spawned somewhere else, right?
[224:20.63]I'm just trying to go far enough away where he gets pulled.
[224:30.35]Why can I not have blocked?
[224:31.49]Alright, he'll get pulled eventually.
[224:34.94]Pull him!
[224:39.72]Pull back!
[224:49.37]I think I actually have to restart this.
[225:02.13]R2 is just over there like, oh, what a bunch of fucking idiots.
[225:15.16]That's over.
[225:15.54]I have to restart.
[225:16.66]Restart.
[225:27.29]I can't switch to Yoda.
[225:29.65]Episode 4.
[225:30.59]Look, we're only like a few episodes later.
[225:31.93]Come on.
[225:38.51]Hey, Cho.
[225:45.03]Star Wars.
[225:52.84]I can't skip the cutscene.
[225:54.54]Stop saying that.
[226:03.80]He literally did not need Yoda for that part.
[226:06.95]He didn't.
[226:15.01]Watch out!
[226:27.78]Can someone tell him?
[226:30.00]Tell him what?
[226:34.39]Alright, speedrun.
[226:35.44]Just get to Yoda.
[226:39.62]Get the coins too.
[226:41.24]No, just go.
[226:53.91]Yoda percent?
[227:06.64]no no don't have this happen to him now please jump out that was some pretty good move
[227:38.04]Watch out for episode 4.
[227:39.30]I couldn't get past the Death Star level.
[227:42.20]Well, you were 8.
[227:43.60]I'm 34.
[227:44.02]I don't think I'll have that much of a problem.
[227:48.88]And we cut to me like raging and I can't do it.
[228:00.13]Oh, you're not dead.
[228:09.25]I'm gonna let this play out for a second because, uh... This is... He's chasing around a fly in the house.
[228:19.42]Why is it still alive?
[228:22.50]Oh my god.
[228:31.14]God.
[228:40.22]plant right I just you're making me look really bad you look terrible
[229:11.68]Stupid dog.
[229:12.96]You made me look bad.
[229:14.64]Courage.
[229:14.86]You can do better than that.
[229:15.64]What is that accent?
[229:20.18]I'm getting shown off.
[229:52.32]Alright, New Year's resolution.
[229:53.38]No more screaming.
[229:58.60]You guys understand?
[229:59.66]No more of that.
[230:00.48]No more screaming.
[230:01.04]I'm not gonna scream anymore.
[230:03.41]I'm just gonna chill.
[230:04.33]I'll be just hanging out, playing a game.
[230:07.25]Just chilling.
[230:08.17]No more yelling and like... Like, no.
[230:12.19]I'm done with that.
[230:13.38]No more.
[230:27.41]Kids eat this shit up, don't they?
[230:38.00]No emotion for- No- Alright, no talking- Do you think I can do it?
[230:40.82]No talking for five minutes.
[230:43.68]I can't say anything.
[230:44.62]No speaking for five minutes.
[230:45.98]You don't think- You think it's possible?
[230:46.90]Okay.
[230:50.98]At three- At three hours and fifty-two minutes on the stream, I'm gonna not talk for five straight minutes.
[230:54.95]Okay?
[230:56.41]Okay?
[231:04.29]Here we go now.
[232:19.81]Ah!
[233:01.87]Come on.
[233:39.20]I have to talk.
[233:40.27]You know when you watch like a gameplay walkthrough of something that you stuck on and you find a channel like this that you're just like skipping through this person's like two hour long video which is like dude what do you fucking how do you do this?
[233:54.40]You're doing terrible.
[233:56.14]I just want to see what what the next puzzle part is and you can't you can't even do it.
[233:59.94]This is a walkthrough.
[234:01.15]Alright shh.
[234:06.95]Come on.
[235:34.58]Ah!
[237:02.34]Thank you.
[237:59.99]This video has four views.
[238:09.33]If you were a kid and you were looking at how to beat this part, you would just leave.
[238:14.43]You'd be like, alright, well I guess I'm going to figure it out on my own.
[238:19.76]I need Yoda back.
[238:20.70]Somebody said gaining viewers.
[238:28.84]You know what?
[238:29.14]That was actually kind of nice.
[238:30.08]That was like a talking break.
[238:34.32]How do I... That was pretty good.
[238:41.53]This was quiet for like 10, almost 10 minutes.
[238:44.83]That was like a nice break.
[238:46.41]I should do that more often.
[239:00.36]That was two minutes?
[239:01.26]No, it was not.
[239:03.62]I started doing that at 3.52 on stream.
[239:04.94]I gotta get him up here.
[239:13.78]I have to put Yoda... Hey, get on this.
[239:17.46]Get on that.
[239:22.92]No, what the fuck?
[239:24.50]That's not what I wanted to do.
[239:29.88]Why did he just... Why did Yoda jump all the way back there?
[239:41.46]I can't lower this.
[239:44.55]I need Yoda on my head to lower that, but R2-D2 didn't go on it.
[240:03.85]It's gonna be in the walkthrough?
[240:05.09]Yeah.
[240:09.81]I'm not recording my mic.
[240:12.18]I'm capturing the game only.
[240:14.46]I have it split.
[240:15.16]I have the audio split.
[240:17.24]So it's not capturing my fucking voice.
[240:36.24]Alright, let's go.
[240:38.38]Editors do the right thing.
[240:39.76]Alright, R2, get over here.
[240:42.24]Before I scrap ya.
[240:47.09]Get on it.
[240:48.37]Alright, R2-D2, go on that.
[240:52.67]Alright, R2-D2, go on that.
[241:05.80]How do I jump with R2-D2?
[241:10.20]Let's jump.
[241:12.75]Start.
[241:13.63]Okay, it's five on the d-pad.
[241:26.84]What?
[241:47.15]Alright, but how come he won't go on that with the computer controller?
[241:50.01]I don't understand.
[242:00.84]This walkthrough sucks.
[242:04.36]All that matters is you just skip to the part that you need to see.
[242:06.86]Alright, go on there, R2-D2.
[242:23.67]Who?
[242:24.21]R2-D2?
[242:24.37]What?
[242:24.55]R2...
[242:54.06]What the fuck?
[242:55.78]This sucks.
[242:57.56]This is so- Like, this- They didn't do it good enough.
[243:01.28]What do you want me to say?
[243:02.70]Okay, what do you want me to say?
[243:04.16]What the- Throw the controller into the ground.
[243:19.38]I have not had any trouble at all for four hours until the stupid swamp level.
[243:23.76]And of course, of course it's a swamp level.
[243:26.72]All game developers, I don't care if it matches the fucking scene for scene of the movie.
[243:31.56]Don't do swamp levels ever.
[243:33.67]They're all terrible.
[243:35.77]Make it concrete.
[243:39.27]I don't care if it matches the movie.
[243:41.17]Scene for scene.
[243:42.35]Make it like grass.
[243:58.31]This is the walkthrough?
[243:59.21]Oh shit, it is.
[244:02.39]That's right, I forgot.
[244:03.23]I'm quitting.
[244:09.02]Ah, alright.
[244:09.82]I was supposed to not laugh as hard today.
[244:12.40]Watch... Watch a walkthrough to make my walkthrough?
[244:21.10]No, don't kill me!
[244:28.44]R2, get on that.
[244:31.24]I can't switch to R2 because, you don't understand.
[244:33.85]I don't have two people here.
[244:35.23]Okay, R2, get the fuck on that.
[244:43.43]R2, get on.
[244:50.78]Don't spawn any fucking bats.
[245:02.62]Why won't he go on this one, R2?
[245:05.16]Stand on that one.
[245:05.98]What the fuck is he doing?
[245:24.76]What is he doing?
[245:26.70]Why won't he jump on this one first and then this one?
[245:28.92]That's what he's supposed to do.
[245:34.05]Switch to R2.
[245:41.55]But if I switch back from R2, okay, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[245:46.27]Fuck the goddamn swamp level.
[245:47.47]All swamp levels suck.
[245:48.69]If I ever make a video game, I'm gonna have the swamp level be first.
[245:52.35]The first level in the game.
[245:54.13]And then what happens is, the swamp level, before you even start, it's like, here we are, we're at the swamp, everybody loves these.
[245:59.98]Then you get to start, and then a fucking nuclear bomb drops in front of you.
[246:04.48]And it's just, and then you, that's, you skip that level.
[246:14.42]And then like a portal opens on the left and it's like, oh, looks like we can't go this way through the swamp.
[246:17.94]Let's try this portal.
[246:19.94]What the fuck?
[246:20.84]I get hit twice.
[246:24.42]Why?
[246:25.26]Seriously, I get hit, touched twice by bats and Yoda fucking yeets off of me.
[246:38.89]I'm so bad right now because like this is, I hate this thing.
[246:44.65]Why are they even bats here?
[246:46.55]What's the point?
[246:47.93]This is a children's game.
[246:49.77]Quiet.
[246:50.83]Shh, I'm fine.
[246:52.29]Everybody relax.
[246:54.19]I'm so tilted right now.
[246:55.69]I have to calm down.
[246:58.65]This is not hard.
[246:59.71]It's just stupid.
[247:01.49]It's very dumb.
[247:03.17]You know what?
[247:04.92]Episode 5 is not even my favorite fucking movie anymore.
[247:07.58]Episode 1 was way better.
[247:11.67]Okay, those of you telling me to change to Yoda, I want to... If I change to Yoda, if I... That little can guy.
[247:18.79]If I change to the can guy right now, Yoda jumps off my head.
[247:23.51]You understand?
[247:37.84]Yoda, get over... I mean... They're both little...
[247:41.36]Lower all the mushrooms and then short the mushroom.
[247:48.87]Lower both, switch to R2.
[247:50.01]Don't jump off me!
[247:55.83]Alright, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[247:57.08]I'm gonna do four.
[247:57.52]I'm gonna go for it.
[248:29.16]Okay, so tomorrow we're going to be trying to get Darth Vader.
[248:33.68]Darth Vader is a tough guy to unlock.
[248:42.83]It was easy.
[248:43.53]I know.
[248:44.01]I just hate this.
[248:44.95]I hate swamps.
[248:45.51]Swamps just fuck me up and they make me angry.
[248:48.64]Swamps just make me very angry.
[249:01.59]Light time.
[249:02.55]Oh, swamps are stupid.
[249:04.15]I never want to see a swamp ever again.
[249:07.83]God is dead.
[249:08.39]Whatever.
[249:19.98]He's too slow.
[249:20.64]Yo, come here.
[249:40.29]What the fuck is in here?
[249:41.49]What?
[249:41.63]Why is there a tractor in here?
[249:43.63]There's a tractor.
[249:46.61]Uh-
[249:48.05]I don't remember there being like a John Deere kid's toy tractor in this fucking stupid movie.
[249:54.12]I just called this a stupid movie.
[249:55.60]It's not.
[249:56.10]I mean, why is this here?
[250:17.06]Switch to Yoda.
[250:18.24]Switch again.
[250:22.83]I have to float.
[250:29.79]Farming minus twos.
[250:36.10]How have I gained viewers during this?
[250:37.76]What are you still doing here?
[250:39.44]Okay.
[250:40.08]Who do I... I gotta be... What do I do now?
[250:46.17]Oh, look!
[250:48.77]Yoda's just on the tractor.
[250:56.53]Why is he on it?
[250:59.35]Is he actually... How can he go this way?
[251:02.74]On the tractor.
[251:14.14]Come on, Yoda.
[251:14.98]You can do it.
[251:23.42]Can I, uh, grapple?
[251:27.27]Toy Yoda.
[251:28.05]Whoops.
[251:31.29]I can't grapple?
[251:40.36]What are you doing?
[251:41.02]Great music cue.
[251:56.17]Yoda!
[252:06.18]You crashed the fucking tractor, have I?
[252:10.02]That's pretty good.
[252:12.72]Oh, let me get this shit off of the screen.
[252:20.56]Go!
[252:22.47]Bats!
[252:23.31]Look!
[252:23.87]More bats!
[252:24.59]Oh, hey!
[252:39.18]Well, what the fuck are you- I was standing on the button!
[252:48.82]There's not enough room for three people here!
[252:55.21]We take up the whole bridge.
[252:56.57]I'm trying to grapple.
[253:13.12]I'm losing my mind, I think.
[253:17.66]I really think I'm like...
[253:22.95]Change games?
[253:23.75]No man, not right now.
[253:25.35]No, that's not gonna happen tonight.
[253:39.69]Oh shit, R2!
[253:40.29]Where's R2?
[253:42.75]R2?
[253:42.79]What are you doing?
[254:10.42]Thing is you know all of you know that that's not on purpose It's just like a hard to see what the depth is because it's like you know that I'm not doing that on purpose I know you do This pretending is exhausting oh
[254:37.31]The last three days in a row, I've just... Oh, shit!
[254:40.47]What happened?
[254:41.41]When did this happen?
[254:43.45]When did Darth Vader show up in this movie?
[254:51.01]Sacrifice the droid.
[254:52.07]Uh-oh, he's... What is wrong with him?
[255:02.82]Alright, Yoda, get in here.
[255:04.14]No.
[255:04.72]Yoda vs. Darth Vader.
[255:05.46]This is the fanfiction we all wanted.
[255:14.64]This shit never happens in those movies.
[255:36.05]Alright, Luke, lift me.
[255:48.15]Put this back together.
[255:51.59]Luke, come here, lift me up.
[255:59.81]Throw it over there.
[256:00.29]Alright, let's get up.
[256:10.52]I need another one.
[256:11.47]We'll move this one.
[256:25.54]Alright, let's go!
[256:35.55]Hey!
[256:45.45]Alright, let's just absolutely embarrass the fuck out of him.
[256:47.65]Last hit from R2-D2.
[257:06.90]He's dead.
[257:07.26]We killed him.
[257:08.52]He exploded.
[257:09.12]Nice work, everyone.
[257:21.98]This is a long level.
[257:24.20]I always feel like that because it took me like 30 minutes to do a children's puzzle.
[257:29.60]I'll be that.
[257:30.06]Something under here.
[257:34.38]Ooh, what's this?
[257:53.15]What is this?
[257:53.87]A weather vane?
[257:54.57]What is it?
[258:03.36]Bridge is up.
[258:03.78]Let's go.
[258:04.12]Let's go, boys.
[258:11.47]Get that bat.
[258:12.75]Come on, R2.
[258:14.47]Perfect opportunity for you to show up.
[258:21.99]Imagine being able to play as Yoda.
[258:25.27]I thought Luke was bald for a second.
[258:31.57]There's shit.
[258:36.45]Alright, now what is the point of that?
[258:40.75]Either side, let's go.
[258:46.54]Dude, imagine being Yoda.
[258:47.72]Yeah, I know, that's pretty cool.
[258:52.32]Stop using Yoda.
[258:53.00]He sucks.
[258:53.40]He's really slow.
[258:55.60]I mean... I get to play as a Yoda, though.
[258:59.82]Fine.
[259:11.81]Killed it.
[259:12.17]Whatever it is.
[259:12.69]Cannon.
[259:16.25]Bats are too OP in this game.
[259:18.97]Get stormtroopers.
[259:20.67]Just literally sitting on their ass.
[259:23.05]And all it takes is a bat to touch you once or twice and you just explode.
[259:31.62]R2.
[259:39.13]Excellent work.
[259:47.32]Now we got this.
[259:48.02]Take it out.
[259:49.42]This is it.
[259:49.84]This is where we take the thing out of the, um... We take the plane out.
[259:53.64]We need Yoda to help.
[259:54.94]Yoda, you do it.
[260:20.47]You know what I could go for right now?
[260:22.71]A huge, soft, hot pretzel.
[260:27.75]Big one.
[260:28.57]Who the fuck is that?
[260:31.89]That's Obi-Wan.
[260:48.81]Alright, we're almost at the end of episode 5.
[261:11.12]Unlock all?
[261:11.96]I'm not going to unlock all.
[261:19.48]Alright, we got one more after this, right?
[261:21.78]Or is this the last one?
[261:26.62]Oh, please God, I'm so high right now.
[261:29.17]Well, click the X in the corner.
[261:32.93]Sit down.
[261:33.33]Take a few deep breaths.
[261:35.45]Have a glass of water.
[261:39.10]And just relax.
[261:56.59]Here comes Darth Vader.
[261:57.29]Alright, what happens in this part of the movie?
[262:06.10]This is the part where he goes.
[262:11.94]This is Lando, right?
[262:13.88]Come here, R2.
[262:14.16]Come here.
[262:26.24]Wait, he can't put Legos together.
[262:42.31]Is this a red brick?
[262:44.61]Where?
[262:44.87]I don't see a red brick.
[262:51.47]Is there a red brick?
[263:03.40]I don't understand where's the... Oh, that red brick.
[263:08.03]That one.
[263:09.41]I thought somebody said it was behind the X-Wing.
[263:15.43]Can't even go over there.
[263:16.25]I don't think I can get that.
[263:23.97]How do I get that?
[263:24.55]You have to be in free play.
[263:28.97]Alright, okay.
[263:29.71]Well, here we are again.
[263:31.05]We get to do this again.
[263:53.00]What the fuck?
[263:56.38]I think I was already dead.
[263:57.24]This is what I'm talking about.
[264:01.10]I like the lightsaber fight.
[264:02.16]No swamp levels.
[264:11.03]Can we leave?
[264:11.39]Can you hover over there and get that?
[264:15.54]Whatever, I don't even care.
[264:18.00]I don't even care.
[264:21.74]Streamer confused by glass.
[264:45.79]Hold it out.
[264:48.20]Excuse me, R2.
[264:53.48]Ding.
[264:54.92]Where's the ding?
[265:02.08]I love when I get to play this game and be a hero.
[265:19.53]Hey shoot.
[265:21.11]Shoot the door.
[265:23.25]Shoot the door.
[265:27.01]Not done, oh.
[265:29.23]Shoot door.
[265:35.78]Let's go.
[265:39.70]Only bounty hunters can access these areas.
[265:41.66]Not fair.
[265:48.72]Roach Lucas raid?
[265:49.64]What?
[265:50.26]Seriously?
[266:02.77]Stormtrooper mask.
[266:06.43]Can you get one too, R2?
[266:08.45]Can you get a stormtrooper mask?
[266:11.51]Aww.
[266:17.05]Here he is again.
[266:17.75]Darth Vader.
[266:22.66]Alright.
[266:22.84]I don't know what that is, but activate it.
[266:29.09]B2 fight.
[266:29.79]R2 is going to do all the weird work here.
[266:55.85]It's scripted.
[266:57.45]It's just scripted.
[266:58.07]You gotta let... Hold on.
[267:07.42]Is it scripted?
[267:20.18]Try attacking the enemy.
[267:21.00]What does this even do?
[267:24.99]This puts the gas up.
[267:25.79]Can I jump off the gas?
[267:27.97]Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[267:28.93]He's dazed!
[267:29.69]What's wrong with him?
[267:35.72]Alright, so just play as R2 and just wait till he... Luke?
[267:51.21]Hunt!
[268:02.28]Get him on there!
[268:07.42]Stunning!
[268:11.84]Spawn camping your own son.
[268:16.87]Why is he not stunned?
[268:28.81]Oi, there-
[268:53.10]Arto!
[268:53.32]Put it together, quick, before he does anything!
[269:07.37]Am I naked?
[269:12.73]I thought I just looked as if I was naked with a loincloth on.
[269:19.89]All characters except droids can use this, and operate the crane.
[269:29.18]Now get over there.
[269:40.50]Now activate that for me.
[269:49.72]What is this?
[269:51.32]Can't like touch that.
[269:54.18]Can R2 touch that?
[269:58.11]I have no idea what that is.
[270:05.66]Where are your armpits?
[270:07.92]I would rather... Never mind.
[270:13.55]Wait, I don't have... I'm not a stormtrooper.
[270:15.25]I need my stormtrooper helmet.
[270:24.58]Oh, get it.
[270:24.96]Oh.
[270:39.04]Chat is fucked up today.
[270:40.76]Well... Look, I'm gonna... Listen.
[270:46.69]Yesterday, there was a two and a half billion dollar bet.
[270:50.35]They're a little rowdy, okay?
[271:00.16]Are they running away from me?
[271:11.97]R2, um, this is why you have two players!
[271:14.47]Alright, let's go R2, hurry!
[271:40.43]800% toxicity tonight.
[271:43.39]R2?
[271:52.13]R2?
[271:55.88]R2?
[272:00.28]Hurry the fuck up.
[272:01.04]What are you doing?
[272:14.38]Come on, let's go.
[272:17.24]Come on, R2.
[272:26.18]Scary.
[272:26.88]It's so scary.
[272:27.68]Here we go.
[272:28.32]Final boss.
[272:42.75]Horse push.
[272:49.78]Yeah, be a shield for me, please.
[272:54.86]Streamer, what do you want?
[272:58.92]Held.
[273:02.83]Held.
[273:17.10]Alright, I want everybody to act in the chat right now.
[273:20.82]Like, this is fucking crazy.
[273:23.69]Like, holy shit, I can't believe he's actually going to do it.
[273:25.69]Do it for like a few minutes here.
[273:39.32]I'm fucking nervous though.
[273:40.40]Like, this is the first I've ever been in a game.
[273:45.31]Fuck.
[273:45.73]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[273:46.43]Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[273:47.41]Come on, man.
[273:50.13]I gotta, like, shake my hands a little.
[273:54.41]This is, like, the hardest fucking fight in the game.
[273:56.23]Come on.
[273:56.55]I have one life left.
[274:01.77]No!
[274:02.29]Bad start.
[274:03.15]Really bad fucking start.
[274:07.37]Fuck.
[274:08.42]It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
[274:17.48]If I do it first try, that's got to be some kind of... I don't know.
[274:20.30]I don't think I've ever seen anybody do that before.
[274:28.05]I'm going to be quiet for a little bit, guys, because this is like... Yeah, I'm not going to really talk that much in the next few minutes.
[274:37.05]Fuck.
[275:00.69]Getting there.
[275:01.13]Getting there.
[275:04.93]Push this and then get him up there.
[275:06.03]Come on.
[275:08.10]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[275:09.26]He's at half health.
[275:10.24]Half health.
[275:11.08]Last time I got here, he was at like one heart further than this.
[275:14.34]Alright, stop.
[275:15.40]Shh.
[275:15.52]Quiet.
[275:23.15]Fuck.
[275:26.19]Perfect parries.
[275:27.17]Every parry has to be perfect.
[275:28.03]I'm not going to be able to do it if it's not perfect.
[275:36.84]No!
[275:37.48]Fuck!
[275:38.36]No!
[275:40.50]No!
[275:41.20]What the fuck?
[275:44.74]No!
[275:45.19]No!
[275:54.65]So stupid, man.
[275:56.48]So stupid.
[275:58.10]When you get a spawn behind you like that, it just... That's so stupid.
[276:03.50]I can't fucking believe it.
[276:08.97]Unbelievable.
[276:12.01]Look at his hearts, too.
[276:13.55]He was a full heart lower than he was last time.
[276:17.44]Was it four and a half hours?
[276:24.64]Ha ha ha ha!
[276:25.30]Ha ha ha!
[276:38.82]Alright, get over here, R2.
[276:45.22]Tuning into the screen during that must have been like... This is a fucking kids game, man.
[276:51.49]Like, what are you doing?
[276:52.61]You can't, like, beat Darth Vader?
[276:54.07]Are you over the age of eight?
[277:06.99]ton of people left during that, did they really?
[277:15.35]Did they?
[277:15.81]I don't see it.
[277:16.53]Alright, R2, get on that.
[277:32.27]Oh, hurry!
[277:44.51]It couldn't handle the heat.
[277:49.03]Done.
[277:54.99]200 people left.
[277:55.58]No, that's alright.
[277:57.44]Maybe we'll see them again.
[278:01.92]Pretty good E3 acting.
[278:17.80]Fly over there, what are you doing?
[278:18.76]Holy shit, I just decapitated that guy.
[278:29.67]Oh no, it's Vader!
[278:42.79]Let's go.
[278:43.15]You want to fuck with me?
[278:43.91]Fine.
[278:46.85]Wrong target.
[278:50.67]Whoa, he's here.
[279:01.40]Archer, get over there quick!
[279:31.30]R2 carries the franchise?
[279:32.49]Not really.
[279:44.33]That's it.
[279:46.51]That's not it.
[279:55.32]Wait, are we talking purely kids?
[279:56.76]Because that's different depending on the age group.
[280:02.71]R2-D2 carries the kid crowd.
[280:04.73]And so does Chewbacca.
[280:15.18]But I would probably say the adult crowd, like who carries the franchise for the adults.
[280:19.50]Probably Han Solo.
[280:20.10]Yeah, it's definitely Han Solo.
[280:32.00]I can't even see.
[280:33.12]Did I get him?
[280:40.17]Oh shit, get that.
[280:48.77]Can I double jump?
[280:54.06]I'm losing tons of money, I don't care.
[281:02.98]Do a ground pound?
[281:10.91]Feeding the enemy team.
[281:14.29]An R2 dude?
[281:18.61]I don't get it.
[281:19.39]What's going on?
[281:20.00]Am I stupid?
[281:43.81]Okay, let's go.
[281:45.61]Let's go!
[281:48.82]The ultimate in fall jokes have been today.
[281:54.20]That's not even fair.
[282:01.26]I'll be honest, I kind of clocked out too, like 20 minutes ago.
[282:05.37]I kind of clocked out in this game, but I still enjoy what I'm doing.
[282:08.29]Give me that.
[282:14.14]You get it!
[282:14.58]No, that's so stupid!
[282:26.21]I switched to him right when he fell down, so I lost the money.
[282:51.30]Zero stud Andy.
[282:53.00]Whatever.
[283:05.03]Activate that.
[283:05.83]While I go do work.
[283:07.25]Of course not.
[283:09.85]Oh, that's a big droid.
[283:16.28]This is the best strategy.
[283:17.14]This is doing the running boot in Battletoads.
[283:32.28]How are you?
[283:54.21]You know what's really weird about this?
[283:55.24]I forget what happens after
[283:59.90]Wait, did he just groin hit twice?
[284:02.19]Okay, um... Did that happen in the actual movie?
[284:07.39]He, like, fucking pro skater groin smashed?
[284:12.26]Like, ball bust?
[284:24.66]Alright, this is the final level of Episode 5.
[284:26.90]This is it.
[284:27.40]This is the big one.
[284:28.94]This is when I blow up the Death Star.
[284:40.12]Well, whatever happens at the end of Episode 5.
[284:55.87]Nothing happens.
[284:56.57]Oh yeah, the ending of episode 5 sucks, right?
[284:58.93]Isn't it just like... You'll never get out!
[285:01.69]You're here forever!
[285:03.31]And then it's over, right?
[285:19.68]When does he get turned into a piece of wall art?
[285:27.38]Oh, it's right now.
[285:27.92]That just looks like he full body scanned himself in the office printer scanner combo.
[285:48.31]That's just like bare ass.
[285:52.64]Alright, let's go Lando.
[286:02.44]With C-3PO.
[286:02.86]He's a quick builder.
[286:11.44]Quick building.
[286:12.88]I like it.
[286:28.97]Quick building.
[286:36.91]Uh-oh, it's Boba Fett.
[286:39.33]Everybody's favorite character.
[286:40.53]Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.
[287:03.25]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[287:03.95]Who's a force?
[287:04.45]Anybody a force user here?
[287:06.48]No, you're just like DPS.
[287:08.68]You're a DPS.
[287:10.44]You're a DPS.
[287:11.20]Where the fuck is the support?
[287:12.15]Where's the force user?
[287:15.71]Three DPS here.
[287:16.83]No tank, no fucking healer.
[287:18.71]Stupid.
[287:19.09]We can activate.
[287:30.81]Boba.
[287:53.68]I think you probably would just stand back if you saw a guy doing this.
[287:55.53]This guy, yeah, he's got it under control, I think.
[287:57.39]Alright, let's push Chewbacca.
[288:07.01]Go away.
[288:07.29]He did have a cool ship.
[288:19.32]I forgot about that.
[288:24.09]Shot.
[288:27.97]I'm not going to wait for the helicopter.
[288:38.80]Another one of these somewhere.
[289:04.02]We gotta activate all these.
[289:04.94]Do we have a droid?
[289:06.70]We got a droid!
[289:14.59]Good.
[289:19.42]That was almost a quadruple slap.
[289:33.29]Sorry.
[289:35.05]We got a droid?
[289:35.57]No, we need to C-3PO.
[289:36.61]Alright, stop.
[289:44.00]I think... I think... I think... Whatever.
[289:45.80]Go.
[289:45.96]Shit.
[290:00.57]Shit, I need to- what do I do about- I need to- okay, let's go.
[290:08.56]This way.
[290:15.65]I gotta turn that.
[290:17.03]What do I do about that?
[290:30.95]Wait, isn't this where we came?
[290:32.01]This is the very beginning of the level.
[290:33.69]Oh, I thought it was going to be R2.
[291:12.56]No?
[291:13.02]Which way?
[291:13.34]R2!
[291:18.32]Alright, we have to... Move this?
[291:39.52]Alright, plug this in.
[291:53.93]Let's fucking go.
[291:55.25]What's that do for us?
[292:03.09]Ooh.
[292:04.60]It's a droid.
[292:06.34]Ah, yes, yes, yes.
[292:07.22]Now we can open some other doors.
[292:08.38]Let's go.
[292:08.70]Follow me.
[292:10.22]Let's go.
[292:10.62]You.
[292:19.31]Not you.
[292:21.03]You.
[292:24.36]Put your eyes into that thing and turn it on.
[292:37.40]Oof.
[292:55.04]Stormtrooper helmet on.
[292:57.02]On Chewie.
[292:58.94]Alright, fine.
[292:59.38]Alright, watch out.
[293:08.79]Everybody move.
[293:12.55]That guy didn't even know he died.
[293:13.45]Okay.
[293:13.61]Let's go.
[293:15.99]No!
[293:16.39]My helmet!
[293:16.83]No!
[293:27.13]I can't move these.
[293:28.93]Oh no, he's a bear.
[293:32.27]He really is just wild.
[293:35.40]Why do we think having a wild animal around was a good idea?
[293:38.89]He snapped.
[294:00.08]Build, build, build, build, build.
[294:02.30]I got it.
[294:07.31]Car, let's go.
[294:08.79]Wait, Franken.
[294:36.49]Wait, who can do this?
[294:44.99]Oh, me!
[294:45.63]I can do this!
[294:49.20]Who the f- somebody just came up with me!
[294:52.78]It was me!
[295:05.69]Lando.
[295:21.72]That's a good tactic.
[295:22.42]There's the helipad.
[295:31.01]I got 20,000.
[295:37.84]I'm doing alright.
[295:38.66]I'll burn the crane.
[295:50.32]Pick up the droid.
[295:52.18]Oh, okay.
[295:52.64]Got one droid.
[295:54.24]Put you over here.
[295:57.24]The other droid.
[295:57.72]Come on, three of you.
[296:01.74]Let's go.
[296:01.95]Alright, how do I get them up here?
[296:10.63]Oh, there we go.
[296:16.73]Alright, let's move.
[296:17.43]Elevator down.
[296:22.42]Alright, wait for the droids.
[296:22.98]I feel like I'm just kind of fucking with them right now.
[296:28.91]3PO, come on.
[296:29.31]Oh.
[296:50.60]What's this?
[296:51.18]Oh!
[296:51.86]Droid, come here!
[296:58.50]This is the time for R2 to shine.
[297:03.48]Beautiful.
[297:08.06]What happened to his bump?
[297:12.27]What's wrong with this guy?
[297:15.13]Oh, I... Okay.
[297:30.44]I got it.
[297:30.74]Let's go 3PL.
[297:32.20]It's safe.
[297:38.26]Ow.
[297:38.34]Alright, what do we do here?
[297:40.31]We're going to move puzzles around.
[297:41.39]I need 3PL.
[297:44.51]Yep.
[298:05.57]shit I need to move this this way can you fit through there
[298:42.45]I love his recovery move.
[298:43.57]It's awesome.
[298:44.15]This is the last pylon.
[298:48.36]Hit it up.
[298:49.40]Wait.
[299:07.16]That's three out of three.
[299:09.60]Aim over.
[299:13.60]We'll kill.
[299:25.69]Up.
[299:29.01]Fuck.
[299:29.69]Wait.
[299:33.88]No.
[299:34.26]Who has a double jump?
[299:35.14]Do you have a double jump?
[299:37.28]No, do you have a double jump?
[299:39.08]Chewbacca?
[299:39.50]I don't care.
[299:48.34]Alright, let's get out.
[300:00.45]He hates the game.
[300:02.97]He fucking hates this.
[300:06.03]Alright, draw straws.
[300:07.05]Who's going to go first?
[300:09.41]Okay, once, twice, three, shoot.
[300:12.53]Oh, I beat you.
[300:17.25]Once, twice, three, shoot.
[300:19.67]Rucka wins again.
[300:22.66]Once, twice, three, shoot.
[300:24.64]Oh, sorry.
[300:25.52]3PO wins.
[300:26.04]He had Ruck.
[300:27.20]Lost a hand, though.
[300:29.36]The two droids.
[300:31.82]Once, twice, three, shoot.
[300:34.62]Oh, it looked like it was R2.
[300:36.12]R2 wins.
[300:56.62]R2, I need you to come over to the steam room.
[301:08.74]This is relaxing.
[301:12.96]Good.
[301:16.92]Okay.
[301:17.78]Let's move.
[301:19.90]We have to put that bridge up.
[301:31.04]There it is.
[301:33.20]Alright, two people stand here.
[301:37.39]And we need two people to stand over there.
[301:39.09]We need somebody to pull this.
[301:48.79]There's one.
[301:58.57]Remember, you're so fucking smart.
[302:02.27]Sometimes I can be.
[302:03.15]You know.
[302:06.25]Broken clock is right at least twice a day.
[302:07.83]Hey.
[302:10.65]Chewie.
[302:10.81]Let's get the heck out of here.
[302:14.45]Oh.
[302:15.25]Okay.
[302:40.39]Oh no!
[302:41.01]Enemies!
[302:58.65]He's got genius level IQ.
[303:11.39]I got 20,000 bits, I don't wanna lose them.
[303:14.97]Okay, somebody clip right now.
[303:17.60]I clip right now.
[303:18.38]That stormtrooper was in a bikini.
[303:22.52]What was that?
[303:25.56]Am I crazy?
[303:42.22]There's a beach trooper.
[303:46.44]That's actually what they're called?
[304:20.63]That was Luke.
[304:28.05]He just had a little shiner.
[304:29.18]You got a link?
[304:31.64]Hold on.
[304:34.80]There it is.
[304:35.44]Did I win?
[304:36.12]Is that how the fifth movie ends?
[304:40.49]Super Story.
[304:41.47]What the hell does that mean?
[304:59.48]Nice.
[304:59.80]Finished story.
[305:01.46]Are we hiding?
[305:22.67]Who's like the toothpaste dentist droid?
[305:35.57]Help!
[305:36.84]Help!
[305:41.30]Help!
[306:10.45]Thing from the Addams Family.
[306:15.64]Alright, that was cool.
[306:17.98]That was episode 5.
[306:19.94]12.5% completion rate.
[306:24.59]You have unlocked.
[306:35.36]I can't even, like, fight in here.
[306:36.52]I don't understand.
[306:37.10]What's this?
[306:40.06]A new toy?
[306:48.92]Unlocking Indiana Jones?
[306:50.30]I already did, didn't I?
[306:51.08]Alright, hold on.
[306:55.94]This is apparently a very important link I need to look at.
[306:57.78]I'm probably going to call it here.
[307:09.66]Okay, this is, uh... Gross.
[307:22.32]Gross.
[307:26.27]What the hell?
[307:31.55]I mean, I don't even look like this.
[307:32.65]This is not what I'm gonna look like.
[307:38.63]I don't think I'm going to look like this.
[307:42.67]That's just weird, right?
[307:43.39]That doesn't look anything like me.
[307:50.20]Those are all wrong.
[308:01.34]This one's correct.
[308:15.78]In only two weeks, that's all it takes to get a massive dumper.
[308:20.36]Alright, I'm out of here.
[308:26.11]No, wait, wait, this one's really good too.
[308:27.37]Okay, so let's go, how much have I shaved off the debt?
[308:39.83]30 or 40 million, right?
[308:42.51]20 million for the noise.
[308:45.41]10 million for... It was 20 million.
[308:47.87]I shaved off 20 million.
[308:48.75]Hey, The Egg, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[308:54.94]Thank you, Egg.
[308:57.92]That's 10 pog subs.
[309:04.32]Thank you, The Egg.
[309:06.76]Frogman also gave 5 community subs.
[309:10.31]Thank you.
[309:12.93]Also, the ZatZuck IRL also gave $50 earlier.
[309:15.75]5,000 bits to be exact.
[309:20.85]Thanks for the, uh, gigantic bit drop.
[309:26.54]ZatZuck.
[309:28.50]Jerma, not everyone in chat has necessarily agreed with these terms, but I made it, and I think it's funny.
[309:34.42]Oh, Jesus.
[309:35.22]Okay, this is long.
[309:36.04]Let's see.
[309:39.47]Hold on.
[309:40.41]What are all these?
[309:41.31]There's some of these.
[309:42.39]Alright, let's go over it.
[309:46.93]Okay, how to clear debt.
[309:48.25]All actions can only be monetarily redeemed once.
[309:54.43]35 million, show auto on cam for at least 10 seconds.
[309:56.77]Okay, I can do that.
[309:57.53]500 million, show your two whole feet on cam unadulterated for at least 10 seconds.
[310:04.38]Cross that one off.
[310:07.55]Uh, 800 million.
[310:08.53]Play streamer sim again, but with facecam on for at least four hours.
[310:13.91]Really?
[310:14.15]800 million shaved off?
[310:18.33]Streamer sim stream again?
[310:22.67]That's a lot.
[310:25.23]A whole billion is eat one entire gallon of mayonnaise on stream.
[310:28.51]Cam must be on and showing you eating said gallon of mayonnaise.
[310:33.41]This is really bizarre ransom demands.
[310:39.14]It's like, sir, can you let everybody out of the bank?
[310:43.99]Here are my demands.
[310:45.53]Show Otto for 10 seconds.
[310:47.41]Show your bare feet in front of me.
[310:50.01]Play streamer sim and eat a gallon of mayonnaise.
[310:53.67]And I'll let somebody out.
[310:56.96]This is for 1.5 billion.
[311:00.00]Stream yourself going to a real general physician and get your height accurately measured.
[311:09.52]You agree to that one?
[311:11.96]You agree to that one?
[311:12.90]That's... You want me to accurately measure my actual accurate height?
[311:20.02]Shave off 1.5 billion of the 2.5 billion?
[311:25.87]It can't be an actor.
[311:26.89]No, it won't be.
[311:27.55]I will make sure I will accurately... Okay.
[311:30.93]I think a lot of you guys are in agreeance with that one.
[311:35.61]Chug five Gatorades and do an actual fat fuck IRL stream with the voice and the cam on.
[311:40.72]What's the voice?
[311:41.50]To clear the debt completely is the dump truck emote.
[311:49.05]Debt clear and entire chat zerks off.
[311:51.59]Zorn stream.
[311:54.59]Oh, the fat fuck.
[311:55.65]No, I can't drink that many Gatorades.
[311:56.91]I'll throw up.
[311:59.62]If I can shave $1.5 billion off by doing a full-on, true, accurate, shoes and socks off, feet on the ground, I'll kill two birds with one stone there.
[312:11.49]I will do it to shave off that $1.5 billion.
[312:13.21]Okay.
[312:23.93]This picture, I swear, every time I look at it, it just makes me laugh.
[312:27.03]Alright.
[312:28.57]I will see you guys on, what's today, Monday?
[312:36.63]Thursday?
[312:38.05]Thursday or Friday?

[313:00.93]But in case something comes up.
[313:02.39]Friday, maybe.
[313:03.03]Two Bugsnax.
[313:06.99]I don't know what that is.
[313:08.15]Alright.
[313:09.21]I'm out of here.
[313:10.43]Let's take a look at subs tonight.
[313:11.97]That was... Did I... Hold on.
[313:14.05]Did I shave any money off at all by doing this stream?
[313:16.67]This was a like $2.5 billion.
[313:18.64]They chose this.
[313:20.12]How much got shaved off for this?
[313:23.95]Something, right?
[313:24.31]It had to be something.
[313:26.99]Nothing.
[313:27.33]Zero.
[313:28.56]Oh, this is part of the deal.
[313:29.68]Right.
[313:30.04]Okay, it was a chat choice and a bunch of other demands.
[313:32.90]Right.
[313:33.18]Okay.
[313:34.76]I see.
[313:35.20]No, you're right.
[313:40.22]I actually, you know, I'll be honest with you.
[313:41.76]I think that's... I mean, I think I want to play that again and do the rest of them.
[313:50.76]That could be a really, really good...
[313:53.84]Just when I have nothing else to do.
[313:56.78]Just play that.
[314:01.76]I'm not saying that's going to happen the rest of the week, but I'm just saying that it's a good backup to be like, you know what?
[314:05.90]I didn't do episode six.
[314:07.20]Let's go.
[314:16.67]Six day rule.

[314:54.82]And I want you to tell me if the game looks any good.
[314:59.76]I want to know.
