[00:01.71]Yeah, I'm addicted to Diablo II.
[00:03.21]I know.
[00:04.35]I said last night.
[00:05.23]I'm like, I don't think I'm going to be doing Diablo tomorrow.
[00:09.45]Maybe just 10 hours.
[00:10.80]Yeah, maybe we'll do something.
[00:13.04]Well, no.
[00:13.78]I'm addicted to Diablo II.
[00:14.90]This is hardcore still.
[00:17.32]I talked to Joel.
[00:18.72]We've decided that we're going to talk.
[00:21.46]Tomorrow is the day for bomb defusal.
[00:25.77]Just one more.
[00:26.45]I can stop.
[00:28.91]Yeah, when it turned out that tomorrow was going to be the day, I was like, alright, fine.
[00:32.43]We'll just do the Apple again.
[00:34.63]But it's been tomorrow for two weeks.
[00:37.35]Yes, it has.
[00:38.51]It's been tomorrow since January 3rd.
[00:43.80]It's all good.
[00:44.48]It's okay.
[00:45.52]It's probably going to happen tomorrow.
[00:47.50]Will it?
[00:47.94]I don't know.
[00:48.48]Something happens.
[00:49.12]Shit happens.
[00:49.64]It's okay.
[00:54.15]But since I stayed alive last night, I was thinking about it.
[00:57.40]I'm like, yeah, whatever.
[00:59.74]But those of you that are like, I'm not really into Diablo.
[01:02.29]That's alright.
[01:02.93]That's okay.
[01:03.25]You don't have to be into everything we do here.
[01:05.25]But every five levels, I'm going to do a tier list.
[01:10.07]I have 14 of them.
[01:14.45]Tier lists we have not done.
[01:17.86]So every probably like 30 minutes or so, there's going to be another tier list.
[01:25.07]Alright, well then looks like I'm going to have to watch if you're going to do tier lists.
[01:33.58]Okay, we're going full-on double variety stream today.
[01:38.22]Every stream is a variety stream here.
[01:43.40]Do one to start things off.
[01:46.86]Alright, I could.
[01:48.48]We could start one off with an easy one.
[01:51.42]We're targeting all audiences with this one here.
[01:56.49]I hate variety.
[02:01.91]But, yeah, the plan is tomorrow to do keep talking and nobody explodes.
[02:05.74]Wouldn't it be funny if we've been doing this for this long and saying, hey, we'll do it again, we'll do it again, and we just play a different game?
[02:13.58]We just do a different co-op game tomorrow?
[02:20.94]Am I gonna play Temtem?
[02:23.92]I don't think so.
[02:26.33]I don't think I'm going to play Temtem.
[02:35.27]Oh, Freddy.
[02:36.07]Freddy.
[02:38.09]Freddy Dredd.
[02:41.55]Yeah, it didn't even show up on the screen because I'm on my intro screen, but that was $200 from Freddy.
[02:47.85]20,000 bits from Freddy Dredd.
[02:50.50]Welcome back again, Freddy.
[02:52.80]Thanks for your insane contributions.
[02:57.08]And yes, this is Freddy Dredd.
[02:58.82]Yes.
[03:00.07]This is the real Freddy Dredd.
[03:04.74]Some of you guys are like, is this... No.
[03:06.92]Oh, yes, it is.
[03:07.46]The real one.
[03:13.19]They say, Jerma, I'm in Vegas for my first time in five days.
[03:16.53]Oh, four... Hey, Jerma, I've been in Vegas for the first time since last week.
[03:22.12]I'm in Vegas for the first time for five days.
[03:23.90]Please suggest something I should do or see.
[03:26.60]Well... Dude, I've got something for you to do.
[03:33.00]I have a very, very special place that you should go to.
[03:37.89]It is a restaurant.
[03:39.35]It is... Finish the sentence, guys.
[03:43.21]It's in the... Where is it?
[03:46.30]You guys all know.
[03:46.86]Where is it?
[03:48.50]It's in the... Do you guys not know?
[03:56.58]No, it's not in the link.
[03:57.88]Thank you.
[03:58.39]It's in the link.
[04:00.21]It's a restaurant.
[04:00.77]It's my favorite restaurant in Vegas.
[04:03.99]It is Hash House A Go-Go.
[04:05.98]Go to the one in the link.
[04:08.18]Oh, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[04:12.80]Not the link in the description, the link on the strip.
[04:16.52]And if you like blue cheese, get the blue cheese burger.
[04:19.93]It's right up there on their favorites on the menu.
[04:22.35]It's a huge burger, double patty, thin, delicious, juicy patties.
[04:27.05]You've got to go to Hash House A Go-Go.
[04:29.87]And tell them Jerma985 sent you.
[04:32.88]The four of you that have done that so far.
[04:35.56]And when you say that, they're not going to know who the fuck I am or what you're talking about.
[04:38.93]They're just going to think you're a strange person.
[04:47.11]And you're going to get charged extra.
[04:50.08]No, but for real, Freddy, thanks for the... What are you doing in Vegas?
[04:52.70]What are you doing in Vegas?
[05:00.06]The Jerm of fan tax.
[05:06.53]He's in Vegas doing his best.
[05:18.30]They will be that... They will be like that... They will be like... They will be like that guy who was fucked eating tuna from a can with his bare hands.
[05:28.51]Probably performing.
[05:30.39]That's pretty sick.
[05:33.09]You're here for five days?
[05:33.93]I'm gonna have to... I tried to read it.
[05:40.25]Any news on Keep Talking?
[05:41.47]Yep.
[05:42.35]Tomorrow.
[05:43.55]It's always tomorrow.
[05:44.75]It's always tomorrow until it doesn't happen, right?
[05:51.46]but that's a shitload of money to start the stream off.
[05:54.20]Thanks a lot, Freddy.
[05:54.80]Have fun in Vegas.
[05:55.58]Besides eating, oh my god, I did another... I knock the same battery over on my desk every time.
[06:02.73]I have this exact same pattern where I go like this with my hands.
[06:06.37]When I talk... Oh, can I... Yeah, okay.
[06:09.65]So when I talk... You guys can't even see this.
[06:12.07]Never mind.
[06:14.51]Actually, yeah, you can.
[06:17.98]So when I talk, I use my hands.
[06:22.15]If you're just standing in a vicinity around me, just watch out because I go fucking all over the place.
[06:28.83]I'm like, let me tell you this.
[06:30.97]The thing is, and people just think I'm nuts.
[06:34.23]But anyways, I do the same motion.
[06:36.41]I go out and I go to the left.
[06:38.45]So I go talk that way and then bang and to the left.
[06:42.85]I do that forward and left and I knock down stuff on my desk all the time.
[06:48.98]And your hair looks weird today.
[06:51.90]You know, I told myself that I was going to stop reading out one negative comment that I see in my chat rooms.
[06:59.27]I'm not supposed to be doing that anymore.
[07:02.81]Anyways, yeah, I talk with my hands a lot.
[07:07.09]Now I'm realizing why people stand so far away from me when I'm talking.
[07:12.03]I'm just figuring this out.
[07:13.59]When I talk to somebody, they're usually at least seven feet away from me, and they keep going like this.
[07:18.36]What does this mean?
[07:29.42]What's that mean?
[07:31.18]Why are they doing that?
[07:41.83]Because you're a spit-talker.
[07:43.77]Yeah, I... No, I'm not.
[07:47.33]Anyways.
[07:48.19]So, we're gonna start... You wanna do a tier list first?
[07:50.20]Is that what you guys wanna do?
[07:53.90]Is that the plan?
[07:55.90]We start off with a tier list?
[07:58.34]Alright, we'll get one out of the way.
[08:01.83]Alright, the first one I'm gonna do is... Let me move this over here.
[08:08.78]First tier list.
[08:09.60]There's a lot here.
[08:10.28]Alright, we're going to do... We'll do pet reptiles for the first one.
[08:15.70]That sounds pretty good.
[08:16.38]Pet reptiles.
[08:24.41]I'm going to make it be a little smaller.
[08:25.77]So you can see all the reptiles.
[08:34.15]Okay.
[08:35.39]Uh, pet reptiles.
[08:36.91]Tier lists.
[08:37.97]Well, can I even do, can I do this tier list if I've never had a pet reptile before?
[08:41.27]Something's in my eye.
[08:42.69]Can you see it?
[08:43.13]What is it?
[08:44.11]In this eye right here.
[08:45.39]It's wicked blurry.
[08:46.15]What's in it?
[08:46.47]That was weird.
[08:52.20]All my vision was just blocked by like a floating thing.
[08:54.96]Alright, a pimple in your eye.
[08:56.36]No.
[08:56.52]Alright, can I do a reptile tier list if I've never had a reptile before?
[09:01.94]Can I do this?
[09:04.64]Well, how about this is just, like, what I would want as a reptile owner?
[09:09.18]No, I can't.
[09:09.94]No, no.
[09:11.88]What?
[09:12.08]So, hold on.
[09:12.70]If I've never... That doesn't make any sense.
[09:14.40]No, I'm doing it.
[09:14.88]I don't care.
[09:16.04]Alright.
[09:16.56]Turtles.
[09:18.20]For pets?
[09:18.78]I'm going to use this as, like, what I think is coolest.
[09:21.75]What I'd want.
[09:25.67]Unfortunately, turtles are cool, but I don't know if I'd really want one.
[09:32.47]What is this thing?
[09:35.19]I don't know what that is.
[09:37.11]These are all snakes.
[09:46.16]Where's the huge dragon?
[09:53.70]There we go.
[09:55.24]Wait, that's a giant tortoise.
[09:56.50]That's kind of cool, actually.
[09:59.95]Um...
[10:01.56]I don't want a snake.
[10:03.08]They're cool, but I don't want one.
[10:05.34]Bearded dragon?
[10:06.30]That's what I want.
[10:06.90]I want a bearded dragon probably the most.
[10:08.82]Or a huge lizard that needs its own room.
[10:14.56]Yeah.
[10:17.94]I know the names.
[10:18.92]I've watched the reptile guy, and I know what these are.
[10:22.38]They're like the best geckos.
[10:24.48]Crested skull geckos.
[10:27.11]What are they called?
[10:28.80]Crested geckos?
[10:30.30]See, I knew it.
[10:31.18]I knew what I was talking about.
[10:33.86]These are supposed to be the best geckos.
[10:40.50]Is this a chameleon?
[10:42.73]Chameleons seem kind of fragile to me.
[10:44.09]I don't think I'd want one as a pet.
[10:45.55]They're really interesting animals, but they feel fragile.
[10:48.23]I feel like I would hurt it or something.
[10:49.97]You know what I mean?
[10:50.53]They just have these little arms.
[10:53.01]I wouldn't want to handle them.
[10:54.47]I would want to just have them to enjoy viewing.
[10:59.33]They're pretty fragile.
[11:00.07]Yeah, I just don't... I wouldn't want to... I wouldn't want to potentially do any harm.
[11:04.71]Um... We got a snake.
[11:09.91]What's with all the turtles?
[11:14.91]There's too many turtles and too many snakes on this list.
[11:21.27]What is that?
[11:22.17]This is a skateboard.
[11:24.43]That's not even... That's not... It shouldn't be on the list.
[11:27.50]Um...
[11:32.34]I don't know what this is either.
[11:33.16]This is a leopard gecko.
[11:37.26]Those are pretty cool.
[11:38.00]I like them.
[11:38.36]Alright, let me refine this.
[11:52.33]Big tortoise is cool, but I feel like they take big dumps.
[11:56.31]I don't know if I would want one.
[11:59.31]Oh, this thing takes big dumps too.
[12:08.86]Hmm.
[12:09.36]Okay, that's alright.
[12:17.08]Would I rather have a snake or a turtle?
[12:24.36]Where's a ball python?
[12:25.22]Right here, right?
[12:25.70]This is a ball python, isn't it?
[12:27.94]Or is it this?
[12:31.17]Which one's a ball python?
[12:32.03]This brown one here?
[12:40.01]I mean, I really don't, I don't know, is this an iguana or something?
[12:41.99]I don't know what these are.
[12:42.65]Turtles are a pain to take care of.
[12:48.79]I've never had one.
[12:49.39]I don't know what these are, though.
[12:52.29]I feel like if I don't know what it is, it shouldn't be this high up on a list.
[13:03.34]I'd probably, but no, but if you have a snake, you have to feed a snake mice, don't you?
[13:14.59]Remember, what's with the title and category?
[13:16.77]What?
[13:19.01]Oh.
[13:20.31]It's Diablo II.
[13:21.01]We're playing Diablo II.
[13:25.43]Diablo II looking... Yeah, we're just starting the stream.
[13:28.28]Diablo II.
[13:28.86]See?
[13:29.02]Look at the background.
[13:29.54]It's coming up.
[13:31.28]Alright.
[13:33.42]I think this is accurate.
[13:38.06]What's with the quality of the start of this stream?
[13:52.24]You mean high quality?
[13:53.40]That's what they meant.
[13:54.42]Cool.
[13:56.02]Big ass cup here.
[13:57.83]Look at this thing.
[14:04.15]Isn't this too big?
[14:07.21]There's like 16 ounces of liquid in here.
[14:10.08]Why do they make them like this?
[14:12.90]It's such a thick outside and they make it huge.
[14:16.76]Alright.
[14:19.03]That's a normal sized cup.
[14:20.33]I think this is accurate.
[14:24.49]Why did you buy it?
[14:29.14]Because it fucking looked neat to me.
[14:35.56]I didn't buy it.
[14:36.14]I'm drinking out of Kim's cup today.
[14:49.31]you're a thief yeah alright alright that's it uh bearded dragon I want I want a a big uh tegu they're called or I don't take those are the best big monitor style lizards right yeah crested gecko this is an accurate list these are awesome and I don't want to skateboard cool hey you know what time it is now Diablo II
[15:31.08]Let's go!
[15:31.70]Dude, how the fuck are you guys?
[15:35.33]Welcome to Act 3.
[15:39.33]Where are the bone friends?
[15:40.73]By the way, take a look at this.
[15:41.96]I did some work.
[15:45.58]I've been working.
[15:48.35]I made this much easier for you guys.
[15:51.09]If you take a look at what happens, take a look at this shit.
[15:53.11]Ready?
[15:53.93]Bingo.
[15:54.97]Now look at, not only do we have accurate stats and everything, you can see how many points are in it.
[16:01.11]And you don't have to pick the category, you can just click on the one you want.
[16:05.06]For instance, like, here we are.
[16:06.70]Bang, now there's two.
[16:07.72]I can take that away.
[16:08.78]Look at that.
[16:09.30]We don't have to spend so much time doing this anymore.
[16:16.81]And check it.
[16:17.39]We come right back here.
[16:18.83]Bingo.
[16:20.19]Done.
[16:23.77]What the hell does that even mean?
[16:28.18]I missed.
[16:29.26]Oh, you missed the last stream.
[16:30.28]Oh, yeah.
[16:33.64]Okay, so how this works.
[16:35.12]No, everyone knows.
[16:37.63]Let's get our spaghetti.
[16:40.65]Eat some monster here.
[16:42.69]What was the last thing I did?
[16:43.44]Oh yeah, didn't I want to kill on Daryl again?
[16:45.20]I'm so addicted to this.
[16:46.62]I wanted to play it so bad after streaming that I went to bed immediately because I wanted to wake up early to play it again.
[16:52.60]Where are the skeletons?
[16:54.65]Well, I have to kill something to get a skeleton.
[16:56.13]We need a mission first.
[16:59.35]They don't know.
[16:59.85]Alright, how does it work?
[17:00.61]Let me explain.
[17:00.99]Greetings.
[17:02.66]So, uh, you level up in this game with an experience bar.
[17:07.26]What do you fucking do?
[17:08.60]Okay?
[17:09.35]So you level up with an experience bar.
[17:10.85]When we level up, we're going to get five stat points to put into these.
[17:15.25]And I have 50 strength as a necromancer, which is a little odd this early.
[17:22.88]75 Vitality.
[17:23.62]The chat has been picking these.
[17:25.69]These are skill points, right?
[17:27.65]So the images that you're seeing here are all laid out across here.
[17:31.32]Before, yesterday, we were picking categories first.
[17:35.71]And that was sort of a pain in the ass, so I figured I'd just dump the whole thing out.
[17:38.52]Stop blaming chat.
[17:40.52]And this is what chat has selected so far.
[17:42.98]They really like skeleton friends.
[17:46.66]But they don't like giving me any offensive abilities.
[17:49.78]So I'm forced, unfortunately, to walk around with an axe and swing at it with a bunch of strength.
[17:57.55]So, and not only that, they've been incredibly indecisive as to what they want to do here.
[18:02.48]Because, look, we have points in Skeleton, we have points in Skeletal Mage, Skeleton Mastery.
[18:07.90]But also, we're going multiple points down here into Golems and Golem Mastery.
[18:12.72]They're not really sure what they want to do.
[18:18.10]He's mad about this.
[18:19.20]No, I think it's fun.
[18:21.63]What are the skeletons' names?
[18:23.67]Okay, so there's seven.
[18:25.67]So it's Laffy, Daffy, Sleepy, Snoozy, Grumpy, Hungry, and... Ed.
[18:42.24]Whatever they are.
[18:44.10]Got Donkey.
[18:45.26]That's Shrek.
[18:47.19]Alright, let's get some skeletons.
[19:01.84]Hungry?
[19:02.66]Really?
[19:03.16]What's wrong with Hungry?
[19:08.56]You missed the Dark Wanderer.
[19:10.75]No, I didn't.
[19:11.81]I knew he turns into the slugs.
[19:16.21]Alright, we gotta talk to... No, we don't.
[19:19.13]Act 3 sucks.
[19:20.23]Let's just be real.
[19:23.79]How long is the stream gonna be today?
[19:25.21]As long as... Until I'm satisfied.
[19:31.01]So it might be very long.
[19:34.67]Yesterday, I was not satisfied for a long time.
[19:37.21]Here we go.
[19:37.51]Here's our friends.
[19:40.51]Yeah, so actually it's ten people.
[19:50.20]Both fight in Dariil till you get a unique.
[19:52.64]But I got to make some progress first because Act 3 really is such a pain in the ass.
[19:56.90]And then we get to do Act 4, which is the best act in the game.
[20:06.17]You started catching your streams live playing Minecraft.
[20:08.71]It's the dream.
[20:09.59]Well, welcome.
[20:15.73]Oh, don't you have to find the weapon?
[20:16.83]Yeah, I gotta find a weapon out here.
[20:18.07]It's a random event.
[20:20.05]How many players?
[20:22.80]Uh, five.
[20:26.54]Setting the players to five, I'm in single player because those of you that weren't here yesterday, my account got banned.
[20:32.04]I don't know why.
[20:33.55]It did.
[20:34.95]So I have a banned fucking Battle.net account.
[20:38.15]And I have to play in single player.
[20:39.43]This is hardcore.
[20:40.19]If I die, it's over and I can't get this character back.
[20:47.47]But when I do players, I can set the game to be harder.
[20:50.57]So the game thinks there's five people in the game right now.
[20:53.27]So everything's harder.
[21:04.10]I think I already found it.
[21:04.72]Oh, how about I... Oh, yes, and by the way, every 30 or 40 minutes, we're going to do another tier list.
[21:17.43]We're doing a double here.
[21:28.80]What did I say?
[21:29.30]Every, like, five levels?
[21:32.04]There's so much poison in Acts 2 and 3.
[21:33.52]Yeah, there is.
[21:40.06]He's gonna forget?
[21:40.72]No, the stream's been live for 20 minutes.
[21:45.47]So, at minute number... Let's see, so when did I... What, 10 minutes ago did I start?
[21:51.99]When did I run out here?
[21:56.66]Alright, we need to find the spider.
[22:00.51]The thing about Act 3 is you have to find... Remember the cube and the staff and all that bullshit in Act 2?
[22:06.33]Well, they decided that they wanted to do that, but make it... Add, like, three more items to find.
[22:12.61]So we have to find the heart, the brain, the guts, the blood.
[22:16.75]We've got to find so much shit and make this giant flail, which then lets us go to Mephisto's lair.
[22:21.35]I've never played this before.
[22:26.27]And there's nothing over here.
[22:33.82]That's a spoiler.
[22:35.66]That's okay.
[22:39.38]Imagine explaining that all to a boomer.
[22:43.90]Well, if you're a boomer, you may have played this game already.
[22:49.14]Something that a boomer might know more than you guys right now is the necromancer skill tree.
[22:54.39]Alright, we're not going over there.
[23:07.55]Oh, fuck!
[23:08.05]I forgot about this.
[23:09.09]Damn it.
[23:09.73]It upgrades the gem that's in your inventory.
[23:14.01]God damn it.
[23:14.54]I've ruined it.
[23:16.58]That gem shrine, if you bring any gem, it upgrades it immediately.
[23:19.96]If it's in your inventory to the next higher quality, I could have just made, like, a flawless... I'm just gonna... I think I should probably restart the whole thing.
[23:29.42]Yeah, I'll restart from scratch.
[23:30.48]Alright, well, where do I... Where the hell am I going?
[23:36.93]Looking for the spider cavern.
[23:39.37]Ooh.
[23:40.49]Oh, that wasn't even a good one.
[23:45.97]You're save scumming.
[23:50.13]I'm not save scumming.
[23:51.43]Oh, it was a stunted room.
[23:57.17]Here we go.
[23:58.47]There's a well up here.
[23:59.23]Thank God.
[23:59.89]Ah, that's some good cider.
[24:10.75]Make the top corner of all different face cams a view.
[24:15.19]People wanted me to do that yesterday, but that's... I feel like that's going to get old real quick.
[24:21.67]You know what?
[24:22.37]That's going to get old very quickly.
[24:30.18]Do it.
[24:30.56]Alright.
[24:32.06]Um...
[24:55.58]It's gonna take a long time.
[25:12.68]I gotta go in a place that's safe.
[25:14.38]Okay, there we go.
[25:24.03]I'm safe here, right?
[25:49.64]This is gonna fucking break my computer.
[25:56.85]And I'm gonna delay them too so when I move around.
[26:01.14]This actually might fuck up the computer though.
[26:27.61]Why isn't that working?
[26:34.67]No, I can't.
[26:35.56]It can only be one source.
[26:38.06]It can only be one source.
[26:40.20]It can't happen.
[26:41.62]I'm going to have to invert the colors and move them around.
[26:45.24]I can't delay them.
[26:45.90]It has to be different cameras.
[26:50.19]These are technically a copy.
[26:51.53]No, it's going to do it all of them.
[26:55.79]Yeah, watch this.
[26:56.37]Ready?
[27:05.23]Yeah, I can't.
[27:06.59]It's still connected.
[27:09.84]Sorry, guys.
[27:10.66]We tried.
[27:11.66]I need, like, six cameras.
[27:16.84]Oh, well.
[27:17.79]Worth a shot.
[27:23.81]See?
[27:24.09]Yeah, I can't do them individually.
[27:26.63]Go get six cameras!
[27:37.88]What did I do?
[27:38.64]I just became the green goblin.
[27:58.19]Which one of these is real?
[27:59.11]Alright, get rid of this one.
[28:06.86]I'm still alive, right?
[28:19.83]No, no.
[28:20.43]I'm playing Diablo II now.
[28:22.27]That's weird.
[28:31.41]You look sick.
[28:32.91]I look like I'm about to puke.
[28:35.71]Wait, hold on, we need that music.
[28:55.59]Wait, wait, hold on.
[28:56.57]We need that music to play.
[29:12.74]Someone that's like, what's it called?
[29:14.74]No, no, no, it's longer than this, isn't it?
[29:25.26]Hold on, wait.
[29:31.08]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[29:32.12]How old is this?
[29:43.15]Two days, maybe?
[29:43.77]Can I play Diablo II now, please?
[30:19.77]I don't know what to tell you.
[30:24.66]I don't understand.
[30:25.42]Okay, I'm playing the game now.
[30:27.94]I'm gonna play the game.
[30:30.04]That was not even close.
[30:39.67]I want to see that.
[30:41.21]Show it to me.
[30:41.93]Show it to me.
[30:42.47]I need to see what I've done.
[30:44.79]I need to see that.
[30:46.13]Please show me.
[31:04.77]Don't show him.
[31:05.45]Show me!
[31:05.97]It wasn't that bad.
[31:08.49]It was kind of humorous.
[31:12.50]No one clipped it because no one thought it was funny.
[31:15.48]Oh, really?
[31:17.82]Nobody thought it was funny?
[31:19.30]Oh, rats!
[31:41.54]If I die right now in hardcore, if I can trap somewhere... Goddammit.
[31:57.98]Alright, here we go.
[31:59.46]A Necrovencher!
[32:02.70]What am I looking for?
[32:03.30]Stony field or something?
[32:07.73]I think my girlfriend's cheating on her husband.
[32:09.53]What do I do?
[32:14.15]I don't think it's going to work out.
[32:27.64]Why did I read that?
[32:28.70]Because it was the first thing that my brain looked at.
[32:37.38]Alright, come on.
[32:37.78]We need spider caverns.
[32:39.60]Watch it, watch it, watch it.
[32:48.15]Why are we all spread out?
[32:49.89]Everyone join together.
[32:59.43]Wait, I need the permanent stat points.
[33:02.81]Do another joke, E-clown.
[33:10.35]How about you?
[33:14.22]Sit down.
[33:14.84]You've been standing this whole time.
[33:16.30]You were waiting for an opportunity to point and scream during a lull in the performance here.
[33:21.30]Mm-hmm.
[33:42.64]You bring a potion to this guy.
[33:45.32]And he gives you stat increases.
[33:46.92]Stop reading chat messages.
[33:48.86]A red spy is in the face.
[33:50.83]What?
[34:15.64]I had to breathe halfway through that.
[34:16.86]Because I went right into it.
[34:18.38]So that's why it stopped when it went that fast.
[34:20.16]I had to breathe.
[34:23.72]Alright, get in here.
[34:24.32]Let's go.
[34:25.14]Big fight.
[34:25.63]Big fight.
[34:30.73]Can't just drop a track like that without warning.
[34:32.45]I was about to turn the fucking cam on.
[34:38.88]He puked green and played sound again.
[34:45.84]After every fucking bad thing that happens, I'm gonna do that.
[34:48.94]And I'm gonna see how long it takes for a thousand people to leave.
[34:53.73]Found it!
[35:01.95]If more people leave from Bugleberry than they do from that, then Bugleberry really might need to retire, it's terrible.
[35:10.36]Oh shit, need mages.
[35:17.73]I'm kidding.
[35:18.35]Why would I ever retire Bugleberry?
[35:19.61]He's the best character ever.
[35:25.43]Is there a unique here?
[35:26.45]Alright, we're looking for the eyes or the brain?
[35:31.28]What's in the cavern?
[35:36.90]Ooh!
[35:37.70]Oh, come on.
[35:39.54]I forgot to... Look at all these potions.
[35:41.50]This is a joke.
[35:46.05]Good to see you.
[35:48.75]Thirteenth of life.
[35:49.47]Getting rid of these.
[35:58.76]Still keep that.
[35:59.36]That's good.
[36:00.76]Add.
[36:01.56]Add.
[36:02.54]Sell.
[36:02.86]Sell.
[36:03.68]Sell.
[36:03.94]Sell.
[36:04.20]Sell.
[36:04.44]Sell.
[36:04.90]Sell.
[36:05.20]Sell.
[36:05.52]Only big potions.
[36:08.08]I wish I had a bigger belt.
[36:18.10]How many keys do I have?
[36:19.84]Get rid of that.
[36:21.00]Get rid of, uh, alright.
[36:22.55]Put these here.
[36:24.05]I'm sorry for backups.
[36:24.91]Get rid of that.
[36:25.99]Okay.
[36:26.83]Oh, I got six.
[36:27.69]One.
[36:30.41]He's still... Why is he playing a normie build?
[36:36.05]Is the title of my stream working?
[36:39.17]Is the title of the stream working?
[36:42.30]Hello?
[36:42.64]Hello?
[36:44.12]Is the title working?
[36:49.59]I didn't pick any of this.
[36:53.37]Why did he pick a normie build?
[36:56.23]Hello?
[37:02.03]Are you calling Bugleberry a bad character?
[37:04.82]No.
[37:07.78]Now he's mad.
[37:09.00]No, he's not.
[37:09.50]He's fucking glad.
[37:12.62]Bugleberry emote?
[37:14.02]Yeah, and it's gonna be 12 slots.
[37:15.34]I'm gonna ruin my chat.
[37:19.24]Alright, let's go get that side.
[37:20.06]And it's gonna be a screen cap-up when he goes... It's gonna be like Bugleberry 01 through 12.
[37:35.69]Ooh, Splint Mail.
[37:43.47]Can he worth... Oh, he's got something. 822.
[38:05.90]do it for April fools yeah alright how many slots do I have well there go there's your April fools joke guys it's gonna be like 35 slots or like 38 slots oh I don't know about that I'm gonna have to get rid of it immediately though
[38:39.09]Because that would be a disaster.
[38:40.91]Because people would be doing that in other streams and shit.
[38:43.77]And nobody wants like a 50 slot emote destroying their whole tavern.
[38:51.89]I'm not going to... I don't want to be responsible for that one.
[39:02.76]Unleash the blade.
[39:04.66]No.
[39:05.30]It's so bad.
[39:09.16]You want to know the quickest way to make a bunch of people hate your guts?
[39:12.70]Ruin their stream with a 50 slot emote that people spam.
[39:18.20]Is this, uh... What's this, uh... Is this the guy with the mask on?
[39:21.79]In the chat?
[39:22.53]What's this?
[39:24.83]Can we fucking take care of that?
[39:28.47]That's it.
[39:28.87]That's it.
[39:29.91]And now do that across 5,000 channels.
[39:36.87]The fuck is that?
[39:37.55]Jerma?
[39:40.01]Fucking stupid, man.
[39:42.49]That's it.
[39:42.85]That's it.
[39:43.66]It's not going to be like... That was funny.
[39:49.78]Fucking Jerma.
[39:50.74]Who the fuck's that?
[39:52.77]Fucking dick.
[39:57.99]Holy shit.
[39:59.03]That was a big chest.
[40:08.22]Flawed diamond.
[40:08.82]Always pick up the diamonds.
[40:09.64]Anything else?
[40:12.76]No.
[40:20.08]And then that person then goes into their Discord and gets in a group with a couple friends, other streamers or something.
[40:26.92]You guys see this, like, Jerma Bugleberry emote thing?
[40:30.42]Yeah.
[40:31.02]Yeah.
[40:32.18]Who's this fucking guy think he is?
[40:33.28]That's funny, dude.
[40:34.97]You could, like, take over a whole channel with that.
[40:36.61]That's funny.
[40:39.55]Imagine the f- imagine the f- what kind of person you gotta be to do that.
[40:42.46]That was so funny, dude.
[40:54.36]Yeah, and I gotta- and by the way, that happened, she- no, no, seriously, that's such f- fucking bullshit.
[40:59.73]I just got an ace in CS:GO when it happened, too.
[41:02.93]And that's in the- that people were like, just ruined everything.
[41:08.09]I had to turn away from the computer in the middle of it and ban a bunch of people and shit, man.
[41:12.35]Twitch should fucking do something about that.
[41:14.41]I can't believe I still haven't found this thing.
[41:31.60]Why do all the streamers sound like the E3 actual gameplay fake voice chat?
[41:47.72]I don't know.
[41:49.38]That was pretty good.
[41:59.54]Come on, give me some, give me some unique.
[42:06.51]F rune.
[42:14.79]Are we missing anybody?
[42:16.09]I don't even... I missed like six people.
[42:23.26]I wish I had a move instead of just... Guys, if you come to a Diablo II stream and you see the arrow pointing down here on the left mouse click... Hey, dude, somebody help this guy.
[42:42.19]Omega Lo, look.
[42:43.07]Omega Lo.
[42:43.77]Omega Lo.
[42:44.41]What is it?
[42:54.27]What?
[42:57.09]Halo and the Nancy Drew game were among the most popular Steam games in December.
[43:06.14]No way.
[43:09.00]There's no way.
[43:15.52]What?
[43:18.01]I can't believe it.
[43:20.19]How?
[43:21.75]Do we have a source on this?
[43:29.35]Hold on a second.
[43:37.87]Is this PC Gamer?
[43:42.81]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[43:52.41]Okay, hold on.
[43:58.33]I have to read this.
[44:03.14]I don't fucking believe this.
[44:04.50]I really don't.
[44:06.10]No, wrong thing.
[44:06.90]Where is it?
[44:15.25]Wait, what the fuck is this?
[44:16.29]Why can't I capture this?
[44:19.73]Horn tabs.
[44:21.03]Yeah.
[44:21.81]No.
[44:35.48]Okay, here we go.
[44:41.72]Halo?
[44:44.49]I can't fucking believe this.
[44:45.53]This is going to be fucked up for a second.
[45:05.52]We need to read this.
[45:08.45]Okay.
[45:15.57]This has to be a joke.
[45:16.45]No, it's not.
[45:19.24]Okay.
[45:20.52]Valve has posted a list of the most successful Steam releases in December, and as usual, it's a mix of the expected.
[45:26.86]Halo, Red Dead Redemption 2, and the surprising Nancy Drew Midnight in Salem.
[45:32.84]VR Paradise Gentlemen's Club.
[45:34.61]The list isn't ordered, so we don't know which among these sold best, but it's a testament to the wide range of games available on the platform.
[45:42.39]The list is determined by the amount of revenue generated during the first fortnight of each game's launch.
[45:55.52]No, no, this is not us.
[45:57.04]This is a popular franchise.
[46:02.03]This has nothing to do with us.
[46:12.59]Even the screenshot, though, is... No, there's no way.
[46:19.74]It's probably just really popular.
[46:21.24]I have no fucking idea, man.
[46:33.48]Don't ask me.
[46:40.50]Alright, anyways.
[46:41.60]Weird shit today, huh?
[46:44.07]Weird shit today.
[46:48.25]Got some real weird shit going on.
[46:53.28]Nobody else even streams that game.
[46:54.62]But don't people buy that game?
[47:00.92]Is the Dru crew really that large?
[47:03.10]It can't be.
[47:05.79]I talked a lot of shit, too.
[47:06.89]I said there wasn't enough people on the Dru crew to even make a full baseball team.
[47:11.93]And it was the second most revenue-generating game on Steam.
[47:17.91]Uh, reverse it.
[47:19.45]They're the ones in the stadium.
[47:25.38]They weren't ordered.
[47:28.79]So you're telling me that VR Gentleman's Club could be more popular.
[47:36.89]Is this even the right place to get the item?
[47:40.27]It's not.
[47:41.31]No, it's not.
[47:41.95]I'm in the wrong place.
[47:43.05]Yeah, I'm in the wrong place.
[47:54.06]It's the Spider Cavern.
[47:55.28]Not the Arachnid Lair.
[47:58.27]Jeremy.
[48:00.41]How many copies did I buy?
[48:01.57]I mean, I bought like 20 Nancy Drew games or something.
[48:07.13]It's guaranteed top 20.
[48:15.56]Spider Cavern.
[48:16.42]Spider Cavern.
[48:17.62]Well, here's the waypoint.
[48:23.16]Literally just you.
[48:26.09]You made it make millions of dollars.
[48:28.97]That would be something, wouldn't it?
[48:37.18]Not in the right place.
[48:38.02]Apologize.
[48:40.14]What's this link?
[48:50.06]Nancy Drew Midnight in Salem.
[48:52.06]All time peak 800.
[48:57.16]How much is midnight in Salem?
[49:06.98]How much is midnight in Salem?
[49:07.86]$20?
[49:09.64]What's 800 times 20?
[49:26.02]About $1,600.
[49:26.52]That's not $1,600.
[49:33.26]It's like $20,000.
[49:34.68]A lot of y'all getting that wrong.
[49:39.44]And people make fun of my math.
[49:45.36]A lot of y'all getting that wrong.
[49:52.21]That's my favorite comment in the chat.
[49:56.75]Alright, so let's just assume that 800 people bought it.
[50:00.82]There's no way 800 of you guys bought that game during those streams.
[50:04.52]No way!
[50:10.65]I would assume maybe like six of you.
[50:14.09]Not a thousand.
[50:30.56]We all bought it.
[50:34.87]Teenagers play video games too.
[50:36.33]That's what I'm saying.
[50:36.83]I think this is just a weird coincidence.
[50:38.29]I don't think this means anything.
[50:40.88]It's very odd, but I don't think it means anything.
[50:56.58]Alright, well, the next time I get approached by a brand, and they say, hey, uh, Mr. Elbertson, we just want to know, just so we can be confident that you could potentially help us out with talking about our product.
[51:08.09]Do you have any kind of experience?
[51:12.38]And I'll just link them this article.
[51:13.92]And go, fucking Nancy Drew was top 20 on Steam.
[51:17.04]Nancy Drew was.
[51:20.02]And they'll go, holy shit.
[51:22.73]If this guy can sell Nancy Drew, he can sell any...
[51:51.28]You're a Scientologist?
[51:54.24]What the hell are you talking about?
[52:04.12]Look at how big this forest is!
[52:10.83]Missing a mage, we need to have a full stack of friends.
[52:14.71]Otherwise it's not worth it.
[52:22.01]Ring sucks.
[52:24.62]Charm.
[52:25.62]It's over.
[52:26.22]Now it sucks.
[52:29.60]Somebody... No, I'm not going to influence chat.
[52:32.18]Somebody said we're doing this all wrong.
[52:34.23]And I'm not going to influence chat.
[52:35.45]But we're doing it all wrong.
[52:37.27]Just want to make sure everyone's aware of that.
[52:38.85]All wrong.
[52:40.23]All of it.
[52:40.95]Wrong.
[52:41.89]All wrong.
[52:46.18]Now what?
[53:01.16]Nancy Drew is now the most played game in history of Steam, and it's all thanks to this wacky streamer.
[53:09.05]Yeah, I can inspect and edit too.
[53:22.79]Oh, now this is all messed up.
[53:24.81]What happened to my skill tree?
[53:28.46]The Drew crew strikes again.
[53:31.16]Here we go.
[53:31.52]Now I can see what the hell I'm doing.
[53:32.46]Alright, let's go.
[53:34.72]He hates the joke.
[53:37.26]He can inspect?
[53:38.68]He can edit?
[53:41.82]Look at... Ah, go back to town.
[53:51.62]As that only works on your parents.
[53:55.38]You know, you could edit a page...
[53:59.01]that says that you were nominated for best actor in a supporting role and send it to your mom.
[54:05.94]And she'd be like, what's going on?
[54:07.72]What?
[54:08.60]I didn't know you were an actor.
[54:09.64]Wait, what?
[54:10.16]You're an actor?
[54:10.78]Who did this?
[54:14.60]I know because I did it one time.
[54:18.49]She was like, what?
[54:19.21]I'm just kidding.
[54:28.72]And then she got real sad.
[54:29.86]She was like, oh, you little rascal.
[54:35.16]Nope.
[54:47.93]Not doing it.
[54:50.57]Everyone expected it.
[54:51.77]Didn't do it.
[54:55.77]Didn't do it.
[54:57.99]Now everyone's pissed because I didn't do it.
[55:02.03]Alright, uh, what's this rune?
[55:03.47]Do I already have one?
[55:04.81]No, I have to collect every single rune.
[55:08.23]Even Zed.
[55:10.11]Or Zod.
[55:11.31]The hardest rune to find in the game.
[55:13.51]Zod.
[55:13.89]That shit used to go for like 30 SOJ.
[55:18.18]It was the most expensive thing in the whole game.
[55:22.88]It was insane.
[55:24.64]It was impossible to find.
[55:25.72]It was part of so many rune words.
[55:28.29]Some of the best rune words in the whole game were because of Zod.
[55:34.51]What was Enigma?
[55:37.25]What was the actual rune word?
[55:47.35]Listen to this nerd.
[55:53.73]Oh, that brings back memories.
[55:55.53]Yep.
[55:58.63]Almost a level up.
[56:01.49]How many people did you scam?
[56:03.50]With Zod?
[56:05.54]I didn't.
[56:05.88]I never had a Zod.
[56:06.60]Some runes you can't get outside of ladder.
[56:13.08]That's right.
[56:14.48]Not fair.
[56:15.88]I can't get them.
[56:18.20]How's that fair?
[56:22.26]You reserve some of the coolest stuff in the game for, like, the best players.
[56:25.90]And the ones that... Come on.
[56:26.96]It's not fair.
[56:36.23]Lizard doesn't care.
[56:39.73]Why isn't the Harajuku in the inventory?
[56:42.35]Because I don't like it.
[56:43.35]I don't like it being in my inventory.
[56:45.37]Because I like it to be a clean inventory.
[56:48.57]I like having structure.
[56:49.95]I know, yes, there's been 20 potions.
[56:53.57]That's because my belt sucks, and I need a better belt.
[56:57.77]Just stay tuned.
[56:58.35]It's about to get way cooler.
[57:00.52]But it's a cube, I know.
[57:03.32]Uh, what do I want to do?
[57:04.18]I want to gamble.
[57:05.14]Alright, what do I have?
[57:05.78]What's the worst thing I have?
[57:07.74]Boots.
[57:08.14]I need better boots.
[57:09.72]It's boots or rings.
[57:10.76]Should I buy a ring?
[57:12.24]I'm going for it.
[57:12.72]I'm going all in.
[57:13.22]I'm just going to buy a ring.
[57:15.18]Here we go.
[57:23.19]Level one telekinesis.
[57:24.51]Too bad that's not teleport.
[57:26.19]I thought it was teleport and I almost shit my pants.
[57:44.32]Get a belt?
[57:44.84]My belt's okay.
[57:46.72]I need boots.
[57:53.02]Well, I'm out of money.
[57:54.02]So, done.
[58:04.78]You just said your belt was shit.
[58:06.68]Well, I mean, for holding stuff, there's only two slots.
[58:09.96]You can have up to, I believe, five slots in some of the big belts.
[58:14.16]Big heavy belts.
[58:18.94]Don't drink piss, but we'll shit his pants on straight.
[58:24.15]I didn't do that, though.
[58:26.01]So that's false.
[58:32.97]Level up.
[58:38.28]You know what that means.
[58:38.98]It's time for some chat interaction.
[58:55.31]That.
[58:55.83]Fix.
[58:56.71]Everything.
[58:57.91]Alright.
[58:58.55]Light mail.
[58:59.59]I'm gonna stock up to one.
[59:00.93]Dunk.
[59:01.57]We're about to go into the marsh, I think.
[59:07.43]Still in the forest?
[59:11.64]Somehow?
[59:17.36]Somehow we're still in the forest.
[59:19.08]I don't know how.
[59:29.95]One of the great mo- player jungle.
[59:31.45]Yeah, I gotta go back.
[59:34.11]Unless it's- if the waypoint's right here, that's good.
[59:41.15]Do a pacifist run.
[59:42.70]This is probably as close to a pacifist run as you can get in this game.
[59:46.28]Oyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoyoy!
[59:55.58]Second unique of the game.
[59:58.28]And it's probably going to go right to Vik.
[60:02.37]Yeah, Unique, Unique, Unique.
[60:04.81]I used to do this thing where I would... I'm kind of a psycho about this.
[60:09.97]But I would hold on to Uniques as long as I could and then do just a mass unveiling of what it was.
[60:15.16]This is back when I didn't really know the game very well.
[60:18.80]It was so much fun.
[60:20.82]Especially with rings.
[60:21.62]If you got like four or five rings and you're like, alright, which ring is it?
[60:24.68]Because the ring could be... It's only the... You know, there's so much variety.
[60:28.19]Let's go.
[60:37.28]Oh, that's... That's... It's good, though.
[60:43.37]10 strength.
[60:46.05]35% chance to open wound.
[60:47.47]10% HP per hit.
[60:51.30]This is going to Vic.
[60:57.02]10% health stone per hit.
[60:58.06]He's never going to die.
[60:59.94]I'll put that to good use.
[61:11.49]This guy's never going to die.
[61:12.89]That's 10% HP.
[61:13.51]Kyle would have used it.
[61:16.30]Kyle can't even equip it.
[61:18.66]So, no.
[61:21.66]He wouldn't have.
[61:25.06]Oh, oh, oh.
[61:27.32]Got to fight the monster here.
[61:36.45]Oh.
[61:39.36]Champion rat man.
[61:40.88]Oh, I must just fucking sky.
[61:42.36]I thought it was another one.
[61:44.56]We got the, uh, the gibbon, though.
[61:48.48]This is a quest.
[61:53.95]Atalax.
[61:55.23]Alright, get the shit out of here.
[61:57.31]I have so much crap.
[62:02.19]My inventory's just loaded with free up.
[62:05.63]Um... I can get him later.
[62:07.92]Put him down.
[62:14.82]How big is this?
[62:21.82]Actually, kind of normal attack.
[62:23.28]That's kind of good.
[62:30.25]Come back for it.
[62:35.37]Alright.
[62:36.07]Return the Gidbon to Ormus.
[62:42.01]You have done well, noble hero.
[62:45.35]Ormus congratulates you.
[62:47.63]The old spirits of Scatseam will watch over you for returning.
[62:50.87]Bro, why do you, you have a big, what?
[62:53.19]Now, after all these years, Ormus will now once again use his powers to protect the innocent from the shadow.
[63:02.32]The spell that protects the dark side shall now be re- Yes?
[63:09.08]Tearless now?
[63:09.98]Nope.
[63:10.52]This magic ring does me no good.
[63:13.53]Here.
[63:15.25]Okay, what is it?
[63:19.91]Well, thank you, Ormus.
[63:20.59]That's not bad.
[63:23.11]Oh, and 100 to attack rating.
[63:27.13]Holy shit, that's really good, actually.
[63:29.36]Cold resist, poison resist, dexterity.
[63:30.96]Oh, we're going to get rid of... What are we getting rid of?
[63:33.28]Yeah, let's get rid of this.
[63:36.78]333.
[63:38.46]That's a good number.
[63:40.32]That's a weird 33% number.
[63:46.25]Alright, let's try out our new technique to get skills, huh?
[63:52.34]What do you say?
[63:59.74]16 to 37.
[64:00.04]Yeah, it's time to get rid of this.
[64:04.49]How much strength do I need?
[64:05.27]Don't I have that?
[64:08.91]Wait.
[64:10.53]Oh, it's 54 strength.
[64:12.55]Why do I care about strength?
[64:13.91]I don't.
[64:14.35]I don't want you to do 54 strength.
[64:16.87]Whatever.
[64:17.19]Alright.
[64:19.25]So, first of all, we need to do this.
[64:24.01]If you could, do me a favor.
[64:26.72]And... Click on a stat that you want.
[64:33.86]If you click on the screen, if you have extensions enabled, you can click on the screen if you're so inclined.
[64:40.49]Which stat do I want to do?
[64:42.47]Did Jerma stay up all night?
[64:43.65]Yeah, dude.
[64:45.76]Yep.
[64:48.50]How come I can't see it?
[64:53.36]Oh.
[64:54.30]That's why.
[65:00.45]Alright, looks like you guys want strength.
[65:11.27]Frank the gang.
[65:12.33]Mm-hmm.
[65:16.23]Mm-hmm.
[65:18.35]Alright.
[65:19.01]Now, equally as important... Let's... Oops.
[65:30.36]Where'd that go?
[65:34.16]Equally as important... I'm going to actually put this... Where am I going to put this fucking thing?
[65:41.21]Alright, so as you see, here are what we have for points right now.
[65:50.92]Skeletal Mage.
[65:52.16]You get left is Summoning, middle is Bone, right is Curse.
[65:55.20]Don't have to pick a category anymore.
[66:01.26]Just what do you want me to do?
[66:03.18]Where do you want the point to go?
[66:13.25]Mm-hmm.
[66:14.75]Interesting.
[66:16.39]Very interesting.
[66:24.14]Interesting.
[66:24.58]I'm going to give this about two seconds.
[66:39.77]Iron Golem it is.
[66:42.85]Thanks for voting.
[66:48.11]And we're going to go like this.
[66:49.93]And... Iron Golem.
[66:52.55]Now has one point in it.
[66:54.71]And just in case you needed to know, needed to see it over here.
[66:57.17]Here we go.
[67:01.63]Iron Golem.
[67:05.23]Iron Golem.
[67:06.25]You have to transform a metal object, so you need something, a weapon or armor.
[67:12.39]And takes on the properties of that item.
[67:16.45]And then, also, it has thorns.
[67:20.11]So 150% of all damage it takes, it returns it back to the attacker.
[67:22.99]So, um... Let's go.
[67:37.40]So the axe now... What do I lose?
[67:42.11]I'll make him from this.
[67:44.87]Just hope he doesn't die.
[67:50.64]Oh, no.
[67:52.12]This is not... No, no, no.
[67:53.26]I can't wear this.
[67:54.08]This is two-handed.
[67:54.86]I lose two to gray skeleton.
[67:56.82]Nope.
[67:56.98]I thought it was one-handed.
[68:07.37]This is not made out of metal?
[68:08.73]I mean, yes it is.
[68:10.15]It's a ring.
[68:10.73]Watch this.
[68:11.11]Ready?
[68:11.29]Check this out.
[68:27.22]Uh... Does that work on rings?
[68:33.62]I thought it worked on rings.
[68:41.05]There he is.
[68:42.95]And he's made out of a rare, so he's fucking awesome.
[68:50.80]He gets all the properties from what we just did.
[68:54.50]Good luck taking this down.
[68:55.88]Just don't exit the game.
[68:57.72]For a while.
[68:58.44]And don't get him killed.
[68:59.10]Alright, well there's that quest.
[69:07.91]Now we need to talk to Ashera.
[69:11.12]I think it's down here.
[69:13.76]And then... I believe... No, that's probably... Where is this?
[69:20.37]It will carry over when you leave the game.
[69:21.81]That's pretty sick.
[69:24.13]That's pretty sick.
[69:26.53]Power armor.
[69:26.85]Power armor.
[69:31.37]Alright, the act 3 mercenaries are awesome.
[69:33.21]But I don't want to lose Vic.
[69:34.37]How many golems can you have?
[69:35.29]Only one.
[69:53.04]But the more points you put into golems, the more powerful that single one becomes.
[69:57.90]To the point where it becomes its own character that is unstoppable.
[70:02.45]Alright, so now I can hire... I can hire... But I'm not going to get rid of Vic.
[70:04.97]Vic is good.
[70:05.39]I like the aura.
[70:06.01]Okay.
[70:23.68]Quest completed.
[70:25.98]Now we just have to find this stupid thing in the spider cavern.
[70:32.45]I'm going back to the waypoint.
[70:34.15]Spider forest, spider cavern.
[70:37.33]That's arachnid lair, not the correct one.
[70:39.29]What are you shooting at?
[70:53.09]The gold birdie thing?
[70:54.09]Yeah, but isn't that a random drop though?
[70:56.89]The gold birdie quest is a random drop outside, right?
[71:01.58]From a champion?
[71:06.54]Where the hell can I go?
[71:07.60]This way?
[71:08.06]To the left?
[71:11.25]Tier list waiting room?
[71:14.35]I wish I had a ding ding ding ready.
[71:16.11]Like... Ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding!
[71:19.55]You're the first person to say that.
[71:20.83]We were waiting for somebody, so you won.
[71:23.69]You won.
[71:24.21]What was the name?
[71:34.35]What do they win?
[71:39.51]Many people have said that.
[71:42.15]Well, that's the first one that I've noticed.
[71:44.63]I thought it was another one.
[71:47.91]I'm giving you your first rune word Remember that one?
[71:57.58]Kill, kill, kill
[72:17.27]Now we're in the Great Marsh.
[72:18.69]Where is the Spider Cavern?
[72:19.95]That's my lightning resist.
[72:22.87]Pretty bad.
[72:29.00]He kind of looks like a skeleton, too.
[72:36.40]There's the waypoint.
[72:39.00]No, I don't want to be here.
[72:42.03]I need to go into... I need to find the Spider Cavern.
[72:49.97]Can you get a McChicken?
[72:51.89]I don't know.
[72:52.33]That depends.
[72:53.24]How far away is the McDonald's from where you live?
[72:56.24]Do you have a car?
[72:58.28]Do you have Uber Eats available?
[73:00.12]Or one of those other apps?
[73:02.44]Can you walk?
[73:07.94]I mean, are you in an area where I can just take a walk the sidewalk so I can get there?
[73:12.16]Then you can figure it out.
[73:14.84]I can't help you there.
[73:15.90]I can't be the one.
[73:16.46]I can't help you.
[73:18.59]There's not much more that I can do.
[73:22.17]Google.com?
[73:22.57]Are you kidding me?
[73:29.78]You live at McDonald's.
[73:33.12]How do you guys say McDonald's?
[73:34.16]Do you guys say McDonald's or do you guys say like McDonald's?
[73:37.48]McDonald's?
[73:38.74]McDonald's?
[73:39.86]Which one?
[73:40.18]Do you guys say McDonald's?
[73:46.73]McDonald's?
[73:47.55]McDonald's?
[73:51.31]I think I'm going crazy.
[73:58.25]Where is the spider cavern?
[74:08.02]This way.
[74:17.18]This has to be this way.
[74:18.35]It has to be.
[74:21.04]Right?
[74:22.36]Down here?
[74:22.86]This is it, right?
[74:31.31]This is it.
[74:33.57]Right here.
[74:33.89]This is it.
[74:45.04]Oh.
[74:47.42]It's not it.
[74:55.20]Act 3, Pepe laugh.
[74:57.06]Yeah.
[75:03.79]He's missing chests.
[75:05.97]Not like this.
[75:07.07]I'm fine.
[75:08.39]I'm okay.
[75:09.75]I'm okay.
[75:15.96]Mage is dying so quickly.
[75:30.64]Spider Cavern.
[75:31.38]I'm running out of stamina.
[75:34.90]It was really entertaining for a second when you asked us how to pronounce McDonald's.
[75:38.86]Thanks.
[75:40.60]That was a cool conversation.
[75:41.68]You're right.
[75:47.39]Terraria stream 2.0.
[75:48.47]You're walking around letting your minions do everything.
[76:00.96]Is this what it feels like if somebody comes in to like the store you work at and complains about something that you don't have control over?
[76:10.21]Um, so I came in yesterday and there was, I was going to buy this book.
[76:15.39]Why do you not have more than two of those books in your inventory?
[76:19.85]I don't, I don't, I don't fucking know.
[76:23.23]I don't know.
[76:25.51]Well, why don't you?
[76:26.69]What, are you an idiot?
[76:28.35]No, I don't, I have nothing to do with what kind of inventory we get.
[76:31.23]I just work here.
[76:34.98]We just don't, somebody bought them.
[76:37.34]Somebody picked skeleton mages.
[76:42.94]Why did you do that?
[76:44.42]I didn't.
[76:53.53]But you did though.
[76:57.32]Get me the manager.
[77:05.20]Ooh!
[77:06.49]No, they've been so... It's been a buzzkill.
[77:09.11]The rumors are really... That was going to be a huge one, and then they went, no, no, no, no, no.
[77:15.39]I look forward to them now somehow.
[77:25.09]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[77:26.85]I didn't pick that.
[77:28.49]Chat did.
[77:29.91]Why do you associate with them?
[77:32.05]Because they're here.
[77:36.24]Well, why are you letting them in?
[77:37.10]Because that's part of what I do.
[77:41.92]That's what I'm doing.
[77:47.40]We're in the Flayer jungle again.
[77:48.62]Alright, have I lost my fucking mind?
[77:51.42]It's been a while since I've played... Oh my god.
[77:53.16]I forgot about those guys.
[77:56.58]Normie build.
[77:58.12]Oh my god!
[77:58.98]Okay, seriously.
[78:00.00]I can't die to this.
[78:01.74]I will die.
[78:02.23]Yeah, I just... I was in here yesterday and it looks like you're doing a Normie build.
[78:20.41]I'd like to make a return on the bits that I gave, because you're doing a normie build.
[78:28.63]And then this drops the... Oops, well, I actually just did break something.
[78:33.48]It drops like a big container.
[78:35.52]It's like shattered glass in it.
[78:36.98]Ma'am, did you drop this down the stairs?
[78:41.72]Why does it matter?
[78:42.32]I have my receipt.
[78:48.30]And no, it was an elevator shaft.
[79:03.52]Are you alright?
[79:04.10]How have I not found this?
[79:17.30]I'm gonna lose my mind.
[79:22.31]It's not... How have I not found the spider cavern?
[79:30.81]Dude, the golem's dead.
[79:42.82]He's dead.
[79:47.94]It always takes forever.
[79:49.18]I know.
[79:49.92]But how have I... Look at all the... I've covered so much ground.
[79:54.78]He's not dead.
[79:56.82]He's alive.
[79:57.42]Only he doesn't get to be as cool.
[80:01.12]Alright, I'm going to say maybe closer to town.
[80:13.03]Let's go downtown.
[80:16.88]He's a washed up Diablo pro.
[80:19.90]Yeah.
[80:22.12]I know.
[80:27.04]Down this way?
[80:27.60]This is not the one.
[80:35.25]It's not our favorite one.
[80:36.61]Alright, what about that way?
[80:38.95]Down here?
[80:39.31]Because this is the arachnid lair.
[80:43.81]It has to be close to this.
[80:45.25]Below it, maybe?
[80:49.21]Because that's the arachnid lair, not the spider cavern.
[80:53.73]There's no other way to go that way, so it has to be over here.
[81:03.99]Down this way.
[81:09.23]Maybe over there?
[81:09.83]You need to look up a walkthrough.
[81:13.41]No, a walkthrough, it's randomly generated.
[81:15.45]A walkthrough will help me.
[81:23.46]Over here.
[81:25.00]There's some... Yeah.
[81:26.39]Right here.
[81:38.72]I see a... Oh, this is the Great Marsh!
[81:51.77]Hold on, let me look at the full map.
[82:09.89]Is it down here?
[82:13.89]Wait, it might be down here.
[82:22.95]Did I just miss it or something down this way?
[82:32.21]Oh, don't tell me it's right here.
[82:33.37]I walked past it.
[82:36.59]No, that was the arachnid lair.
[82:37.59]It's not the same one.
[82:41.56]Hold on, let me stand still.
[82:45.42]Alright.
[82:46.36]It's probably right here.
[82:47.02]I probably just didn't see it.
[82:48.42]Like in the corner.
[82:58.17]No!
[82:58.69]Uhhh... No, it would be purple.
[83:12.37]Oh, what a pain in the fucking ass.
[83:16.78]Yes, I know.
[83:19.22]Search for his eye in the spider cavern.
[83:21.04]I wish you could tell me where it was.
[83:30.78]I have a... No, I don't.
[83:31.50]It's a... Alright, I'm going to walk out the front door again.
[83:46.81]No, give me stamina potions.
[83:50.37]Be connected to the Flayer jungle?
[83:51.71]Yeah, that's what I thought too.
[83:55.39]Act 3.
[83:59.98]Act 3.
[84:03.14]It's great.
[84:05.36]You don't even sell stamina potions.
[84:07.42]Do I really have to go through another act to get them?
[84:30.11]Jesus Christ.
[84:31.09]Alright, let's go.
[84:34.02]What the hell do you want?
[84:36.68]What are you doing here?
[84:37.48]Dario's dead.
[84:39.34]Fuck off already.
[84:46.39]What do we got?
[84:50.09]Not here.
[84:50.43]It would be over here.
[84:51.83]Nope.
[84:52.03]It would be right here.
[85:00.27]Nope.
[85:02.43]It would be to the left.
[85:08.91]That way.
[85:09.21]I think it might be somewhere.
[85:13.97]Me too.
[85:17.33]That's the Great... No, that's the Great Marsh over there.
[85:20.23]Jeremy, you were already there.
[85:21.81]No.
[85:22.29]That was the Arachnid Lair.
[85:23.79]That was not the Spider Cavern.
[85:24.93]I already went inside the Arachnid Lair.
[85:26.47]It's two different dungeons.
[85:36.09]Oh.
[85:37.21]Look.
[85:38.39]Look what I found.
[85:39.80]Just a sliver on the side.
[85:41.48]And it's guaranteed to be right here.
[85:44.70]Spider cavern?
[85:45.54]Oh.
[85:50.44]Wow.
[85:52.61]You don't have to be rude.
[85:53.25]What do you mean rude?
[86:01.15]Wait.
[86:01.71]How is me saying fucking what the fuck?
[86:04.11]You fucking dumb?
[86:04.82]How is that rude?
[86:07.42]I'm just making, like, a point.
[86:09.40]I'm saying, like, stupid fucking goddamn comment.
[86:11.50]Is that rude?
[86:12.20]I'm just trying to be, like, real, you know?
[86:26.63]You're being a bully.
[86:31.08]Ooh, nope.
[86:34.24]You should put on a mature content filter.
[86:38.14]Look at all this crap I have.
[86:40.52]There's so many stamina.
[86:41.36]I thought it was going to take so much longer, too.
[86:43.04]If we can get the eye.
[86:49.48]Is this the deal with airline food?
[86:54.70]Um, it's actually kind of good now.
[87:00.23]Snacks are pretty top tier.
[87:06.92]uh I've had like those like eat up boxes from jet blue they're pretty great actually they're really good it's like you can get like six bucks or something you can get a like this like sausage jerky cheese like crackers and they're like they're like a nice brand too it's actually kind of good now
[87:36.43]No, seriously.
[87:36.91]When was the last time you guys had... I mean, obviously, it depends on what airline you're on, but... Why'd you have blue?
[87:46.16]You got plenty of options.
[87:53.65]Oh, did I mention more non-stop flights than any airline in the country?
[87:57.59]Something like that.
[88:11.15]How's iron doing, dude?
[88:16.07]Rich streamer eats airline food for lunch every day.
[88:19.09]That would probably not... I wouldn't want that.
[88:21.36]I would eat airplane food every day?
[88:26.92]I feel like something bad might happen.
[88:41.58]Skeleton may just keep dying.
[88:44.94]They're almost getting to the point where they're unsummonable.
[88:50.25]Where my airplane food is for airplanes.
[89:02.53]Gasoline?
[89:10.44]I'm trying to lose health, too.
[89:11.52]I can't just be an idiot.
[89:26.12]No, wrong.
[89:27.92]Ooh, a scepter.
[89:35.70]I'm not playing as paladin, though.
[89:37.48]Unfortunately.
[89:38.37]Not a paladin.
[89:44.88]Balanced as all knives should be give that person give that person a raise Lightning no just drunk.
[90:04.85]Oh, don't get hit.
[90:05.53]Don't get hit.
[90:05.99]Don't get hit.
[90:06.61]I have amplified damage on me It means I could die in one hit This is Jade figurine
[90:13.96]That's a good one to have.
[90:15.06]There's the random quest.
[90:24.94]Man, that guy just won the internet.
[90:29.38]That guy just won the internet.
[90:34.81]Dude.
[90:34.95]Alright, we have the figurine now.
[90:42.71]Let's get out of here.
[90:47.68]Back in Lut Goleyn, Meshif told me he had a fondness for jade figurines.
[90:54.20]What a strange little figurine.
[90:55.72]From the ashes of Buile, I've mixed for you a potion.
[91:04.10]Is the game quiet?
[91:05.84]I don't know.
[91:07.25]It is.
[91:28.83]Alright, search for Kaleem's brain in the Flayer dungeon.
[91:31.99]I'm going to go to Meshif.
[91:34.01]Say hey, Meshif.
[91:34.55]What do you think about this?
[91:43.35]Huh?
[91:53.72]High low, sell high.
[91:54.78]Ask Cain about the bird.
[91:55.54]Oh, that's worth way more than what you came with.
[92:18.99]You should try to sell that to somebody for a profit, even though it might not be even worth a tenth of what you're getting for it.
[92:27.24]I've read legends about a sage named Kuile who studied the mysteries of life beyond death.
[92:34.72]If I remember correctly, his ashes were ensconced within a golden statuette.
[92:42.15]It was a very strange tale.
[92:46.31]Give the golden bird to Alcor.
[92:49.42]This is where you get something awesome.
[92:54.72]This is where you get a cool item.
[92:58.54]Ah, the golden bird of Quile.
[93:01.62]Thank you, my friend.
[93:02.87]Busy yourself while I experiment with the ashes within it.
[93:05.83]Then return and see what I've made for you.
[93:10.09]Turn to Alcor.
[93:12.00]And, okay.
[93:13.34]What do you got?
[93:14.18]Got it.
[93:14.40]That potion is permanently increased 20 to your health.
[93:41.74]what come on you think I'm that dumb 286. nice alright we're on the right track now that actually kind of annoying to do these two in a row you have to find the gidvan which kind of sucks and then this randomly drops from a champion or higher monster so got them both knocked out of the park right away now you've got to go to the failure dungeon get gleam's brain
[94:09.43]That does not pick the loot, no.
[94:11.54]Otherwise, I actually would probably not be able to even complete a single mission in the game.
[94:18.80]Alright, you can pick a couple of these.
[94:33.67]Alright, Queen's Eye.
[94:35.65]Rao?
[94:37.11]We have a nice little rune collection here.
[94:38.71]Oh, I already have a Rao.
[94:40.21]Alright, flood the market with Raos.
[94:46.64]And then dump it.
[94:59.95]Raar.
[95:00.45]Get out of here.
[95:02.97]Why?
[95:03.33]What's the point?
[95:08.20]You know, I look over and I envy some... I, like, want to be that person that just says, like, rawr, XD, and some stream.
[95:15.24]You know what I mean?
[95:16.54]That's, like, that's just so... You can say anything.
[95:20.21]It doesn't even matter.
[95:24.05]Like, I want to be, and yes, I've made plenty of alt accounts on Twitch.
[95:29.01]You've seen some of them already.
[95:30.17]Like, binaryman01001110, right?
[95:33.69]But... I just want to be the guy in the chat that just writes, like,
[95:39.44]Laughing my ass off.
[95:40.60]When do you get Kaleem's poo-poo, right?
[95:42.54]Somebody said that.
[95:43.12]I didn't react to it.
[95:44.20]But, like, imagine being that person.
[95:45.53]Sometimes I envy you being able to do that.
[95:58.18]That's the dream.
[95:59.14]That's the dream!
[96:00.80]Someone did say that.
[96:01.80]Yes, they did.
[96:02.88]And I looked over and I was like, motherfucker.
[96:05.60]But I was, you know, that could have been me.
[96:10.12]Alright, we're going to the flare.
[96:11.28]Uh, where is it?
[96:11.79]It's closer.
[96:13.21]Uh, probably this.
[96:17.19]What's stopping you?
[96:20.45]Um... I don't know.
[96:22.80]The respect of my peers?
[96:25.38]Or something?
[96:41.48]He thinks he has respect.
[96:53.49]Paramacraft lost all respect.
[96:57.35]So you're saying that you lost all your respect for me in 2012?
[97:00.09]What are you still doing here?
[97:11.91]I'm here being angry.
[97:13.81]Why, you hate-watching me right now?
[97:15.17]Am I being hate-watched?
[97:18.25]Is that what's going on?
[97:18.95]Alright, looking for the, uh, flare dungeon.
[97:25.44]There it is.
[97:26.82]Now look at how easy that was compared to the other one.
[97:36.39]Fuck.
[97:40.47]Alright, get in there!
[97:44.93]kill him side take a look 10 to 26 uh he has a unique on right now right and this thing's much better notice how he has not been in any trouble at all he's healing 10 of his health per hit this guy's good this is gonna be a perfect boss friend
[98:14.94]uh four mages now and five still one careful that the fire can melt you instantly as you've seen very very dangerous
[98:47.73]Sometimes I feel like we're all just the people who slow down to look at the car accident.
[99:09.12]Um...
[99:11.07]That's an interesting thought, but no, it's inaccurate.
[99:15.88]This would be like you seeing a car accident, pulling over, getting out of the car, sitting on the curb and watching the rest of the accident and everything play out and like the police report and stuff.
[99:39.46]and it takes like six hours or so and you fall asleep on the curb he's sleeping there eventually the cop comes over and he's like hey um you good oh yeah yeah yeah it was just like I had to see that I was oh yeah I'm going to bed I'm going I'm going to bed bye Jerma what are you talking about
[100:17.92]While mocking the accident.
[100:20.92]Wait, wait.
[100:40.26]It looks just a fender bender?
[100:43.52]How did you not see that car?
[100:47.42]Look at his... Look at his bumper!
[100:50.04]You... You broke that bumper!
[100:58.76]And then you overhear the cop.
[100:59.98]Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to step out of the car.
[101:02.12]Oh, no!
[101:02.52]MonkaS!
[101:02.80]Alright, I could die in here.
[101:17.97]I need friends.
[101:24.72]I can't just start talking random shit in hardcore.
[101:30.66]I know I have a bunch of people playing the game for me.
[101:33.50]Okay.
[101:35.86]Okay.
[101:43.85]Okay, okay.
[101:44.79]I have to stop fucking around.
[101:46.39]If I lose, I can't just respawn.
[102:05.66]Mom said it was my turn.
[102:08.52]Well, your mom is not my mom.
[102:11.79]So I don't have to listen to your mom.
[102:15.61]My mom said it was okay.
[102:18.57]Watch out for traps.
[102:27.18]Alright, it's down here.
[102:32.22]Now speak to Orm.
[102:35.70]Good day.
[102:37.74]Good day.
[102:38.32]Good day.
[102:53.68]Ow.
[102:53.86]Dude these guys are on dead.
[102:58.17]These guys are on dead.
[103:14.73]The soul, the killers, the flayers are coming.
[103:17.99]Come on, give me a unique ring.
[103:21.07]I think it's all worth it.
[103:23.27]Unique ring.
[103:25.03]Unique, unique.
[103:41.52]I might have put that on if that was plus three to Skelton.
[103:46.23]Lot of death in there.
[103:49.91]That's a scary room.
[103:53.91]Ooh, Ith.
[103:55.07]Cool.
[104:01.97]I don't know why, but for a long time when I was younger, I thought it was rejuvenation potion.
[104:14.99]What happened?
[104:21.15]Level two.
[104:21.73]Here we go.
[104:27.95]Oh, you were a stupid kid.
[104:35.14]Alan only.
[104:40.46]You know what I mean?
[104:41.12]I can't.
[104:41.50]I want to write that.
[104:54.36]I hate paladins.
[104:55.18]What about you?
[104:56.98]Paladins are fun to play because you feel like you're contributing a ton.
[105:03.22]When you used to walk into a lobby and people would say like, oh, paladin, yeah, what kind of pally?
[105:08.48]You'd be like, oh, all defense.
[105:11.22]Defensive pally.
[105:13.10]I don't even have any moves.
[105:15.10]I just had 20 points, 25 plus points in some of the best defensive wars.
[105:19.24]I just walked next to people and just chatted.
[105:23.51]you're just a walking buff wow
[105:44.68]Kind of like how you're doing this now.
[105:45.77]Kind of.
[105:46.87]Look at this battle.
[105:51.31]God, this is so invigorating.
[105:57.53]No, I'm participating.
[106:05.80]I'm making them take 100% more damage.
[106:08.96]That's participation.
[106:18.09]Are you guys the skeletons?
[106:22.59]Yeah.
[106:26.68]Watch out, guys.
[106:27.74]We got a raid.
[106:32.36]Watch out.
[106:33.60]Here comes a raid from a channel.
[106:36.18]We did it.
[106:41.81]We defended.
[106:58.82]I figured it out.
[107:00.90]I figured it out.
[107:03.38]That is me chatting in a random fucking stream.
[107:06.05]What I just did right there.
[107:09.15]I do that all the time.
[107:10.25]I do shit like that all the fucking time.
[107:15.19]So I do get to participate in that.
[107:20.17]Oh no, they all left.
[107:26.86]Stay away from the fire.
[107:35.07]Look it, he killed all the skeletons.
[107:47.73]What streamers do you watch?
[107:50.15]That's a pretty cool question.
[107:52.45]I open up my own VODs and watch them back every night.
[107:54.65]I really like that guy.
[108:19.14]Level 3.
[108:20.06]Here it is.
[108:20.76]Out here somewhere.
[108:28.76]That's an ego.
[108:34.36]Um.
[108:35.84]Is it?
[108:36.10]Stop stepping on shit!
[108:43.56]You're stepping on- Oh, these guys are running over all the traps.
[108:49.26]save my life, whatever it was.
[108:50.14]I don't know what it was, but it saved my life.
[108:53.16]Freeze thing, because they all stopped and... Oh my god, I have to leave.
[109:00.56]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[109:01.56]I have to leave, because these guys are going to come.
[109:04.42]No, I'm kidding.
[109:04.96]Alright, everyone get in here, please.
[109:06.48]Everybody get in.
[109:10.92]Alright.
[109:11.34]Jeez, they're also standing outside.
[109:15.17]If those two guys with fire came over, I may have died.
[109:20.60]That was kind of terrifying.
[109:25.44]I have no way to defend myself!
[109:28.24]I just have skeletons.
[109:29.38]I just have friends.
[109:44.80]And death is permanent.
[109:46.51]So I can't fuck around.
[109:59.78]Wait.
[110:02.46]What a mess.
[110:04.18]What a mess.
[110:04.72]What a mess.
[110:05.62]What a mess.
[110:19.57]Wait, doesn't it say hardcore in the top right when you're in hardcore mode?
[110:22.40]What are you talking about?
[110:27.93]Well, you watched me select it, right?
[110:32.85]No, you guys watched me check the blocks.
[110:42.15]That was it?
[110:45.25]Oh, got him.
[110:46.03]Okay.
[110:46.57]Don't scare me like that.
[110:48.69]Not like it matters.
[110:49.46]If this character dies, I could just delete him.
[110:51.62]It's not like that changes very much.
[111:03.15]I'm very paranoid in this room, though, with these things.
[111:05.31]These guys are a pain in the ass.
[111:12.59]We're gonna have to fire zero.
[111:17.87]Hey, you should do a killed by enemy joke.
[111:26.24]That'd be kind of funny, actually.
[111:28.46]That'd be really funny.
[111:40.85]Come on, where is it?
[111:43.20]Come on!
[111:46.30]Come on!
[111:48.78]Explored almost the whole thing.
[111:51.90]Where's the chest?
[111:54.56]Over here, bang on the left.
[111:59.94]And don't go too far, because wait for everyone to get here.
[112:05.22]This corner, there it is.
[112:06.14]Alright, it is a champion there.
[112:07.68]And does lightning sit in here?
[112:11.57]Yeah, I ain't going in.
[112:12.27]Fuck that.
[112:16.73]You guys do it for me.
[112:21.81]Oh, yep.
[112:23.59]Immune to fire.
[112:24.81]Just kill him.
[112:26.15]I don't want nothing to do with that.
[112:28.35]Good.
[112:29.03]Nice work.
[112:33.63]That's another unique.
[112:38.82]Alright, hold on.
[112:40.46]Yeah!
[112:41.38]Is this shield?
[112:49.83]Oh, no!
[112:51.23]It's... It's ethereal.
[112:54.09]It can't be repaired.
[112:55.23]I can only use this until it breaks.
[112:56.52]50% chance to block...
[113:07.85]50% chance of open wounds.
[113:15.20]Turn it into a golem.
[113:21.90]Yeah, probably.
[113:22.78]Alright, let me just put... Damn it.
[113:36.89]That would be a pretty cool... That would be 50% chance to bleed.
[113:42.87]That would be cool, actually.
[113:45.45]Let me make a ruby.
[113:51.32]Time to clean up this inventory.
[113:53.54]This is pissing me off.
[113:56.74]Okay, time to clean my room.
[113:59.26]Alright, I'm cleaning my room.

[114:43.81]Apparently, I did something so awful, so rotten and terrible, that I'm banned from Open Battle.net as well.
[114:56.20]Even Open Bnet.
[114:57.40]Yes.
[114:58.75]Where hacking is legal.

[115:53.17]There are people that like speed hack and teleport around in Open Bnet.
[115:56.85]There are people that have modded characters running around with 5 million of every stat in Open Bnet.
[116:03.98]What the hell did I do to not be allowed in that?
[116:19.73]hello wait let me sell I think it's time to yeah clean my room time to clean the room
[116:57.85]What are we doing on diamonds for good?

[117:06.07]Alright.
[117:07.51]Guys.
[117:07.81]Let's take a look at the skills.
[117:12.98]We got a skill point to use?
[117:15.52]Please.
[117:17.32]Use it.
[117:21.40]You need some reminders.
[117:24.60]Of course, this is the summoning tree again.
[117:26.22]This is Blood Golem.
[117:27.06]This is Iron Golem.
[117:29.16]This is Fire Golem, but we can't do that yet, I don't think.
[117:34.39]This is just to make sure you can see.
[117:39.53]Alright.
[117:40.47]You can see.
[117:41.27]Where's the skill point going?
[117:44.43]Vote.
[117:47.06]No.
[117:47.20]No.
[118:02.44]Dim Vision Gang.
[118:07.10]Curses are important, but we're neglecting them.
[118:11.01]When I say we, but I mean you.
[118:14.53]When I say you, I mean you.
[118:23.76]The 212 of you that clicked on teeth.
[118:31.99]I don't even know what you're clicking on over here.
[118:37.42]Make sure you try to differentiate it so that the blob doesn't go together.
[118:41.32]Which one do you want me to do?
[118:55.90]I can't even do... Guys.
[118:59.20]Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.
[119:00.98]Look.
[119:03.01]I can't do the fire one.
[119:05.03]That's level 30.
[119:07.33]I am currently level 26.
[119:08.68]I can't do that yet.
[119:15.08]Fire golem's not available.
[119:16.16]Fire golem receives... You gotta figure out... I think you guys have lost...
[119:25.88]What do you want?
[119:27.10]Figure it out.
[119:28.06]Skeletons.
[119:29.06]Powerful golems.
[119:30.42]Do you want me to... You know what I mean?
[119:32.41]By the way, revive is a thing in the game as well.
[119:34.85]It revives any monster in the whole game.
[119:38.23]They fight for you instead.
[119:39.25]Fire golem.
[119:43.05]Iron golem.
[119:43.89]They all get benefits from each other.
[119:51.73]Golem mastery.
[119:54.36]Okay.
[119:56.33]We've seen it.
[119:57.39]Also, this is what's available in Poison and Bone.
[119:59.11]This is what's available in Curses.
[120:03.85]Iron Maiden.
[120:04.89]Weaken.
[120:05.21]This is also Decrepify.
[120:07.05]Curses a group of enemies to make them slow, weak, and take amplified damage.
[120:13.00]Lower Resist.
[120:15.26]These seem kind of cool.
[120:17.88]These are cool too.
[120:19.06]Alright, what do you want?
[120:20.24]Pick it again.
[120:20.68]This time, know that I can't go doing things in the bottom.
[120:33.31]And make sure you're clicking in the correct spot to differentiate your vote.
[120:40.43]Manipulating us.
[120:52.02]Well.
[120:55.35]Still clicking on the fire golem.
[120:59.50]And revive.
[121:01.90]20% of the people that have clicked so far still don't get it.
[121:08.88]We are going to click on Iron Golem.
[121:15.49]Okay.
[121:21.05]Bone Wall.
[121:22.09]Another point in Iron.
[121:26.60]Let's see what it does.
[121:28.92]There we go.
[121:29.36]Just, you know, so you can see to make sure that I'm actually clicking these.
[121:33.32]Remembering them.
[121:38.86]So this is going to bring the thorns up to 165%.
[121:45.10]Almost double the defense.
[121:49.89]What's the attack turn into?
[121:50.85]7 and 9?
[121:51.39]Let's see.
[121:52.85]Yeah.
[121:53.47]Huge defense increase.
[122:00.56]And more thorns.
[122:01.14]Alright, stat points.
[122:04.81]You know what to do.
[122:06.05]You guys are smart.
[122:06.67]You know what to do.
[122:10.19]By the way, for those of you who don't know, strength is melee damage and wearing heavy equipment.
[122:14.49]Dexterity is how often you hit enemies in your defense.
[122:18.20]How often you obviously don't get hit.
[122:20.70]Vitality, health, and stamina.
[122:23.98]Energy is just mana pool.
[122:26.86]More mana.
[122:49.08]Getting close to a tier list What is the right choice
[123:03.69]Um... If you're talking about a super-duper min-max build... No.
[123:10.63]Why would I even tell you?
[123:23.76]Vitality!
[123:26.98]Good.
[123:32.75]At least you guys are doing that.
[123:35.28]If you guys actually did put every point into strength... Remember when I took that fire damage down to here?
[123:41.70]Without this extra 150, whatever, 100 plus health, I'm dead.
[123:49.77]Alright.
[123:50.65]Cleaned my room a little bit.
[123:54.39]Stored some gold, just in case I die.
[123:56.47]And then, you know, my heirs don't get it.
[124:01.28]Alright, we need to get the heart, not the heart, the brain, right?
[124:04.46]Kaleem's brain.
[124:11.66]How many slots are in here?
[124:14.72]Three, five to 15.
[124:15.84]Hold on.
[124:18.18]This is most fortunate.
[124:20.56]Kaleem's brain knows Mephisto's weakness.
[124:24.24]Place it in the Herodric Cube along with Kaleem's other relics, the eye, the heart, and the flail.
[124:37.05]The eye, the heart, the brain, and the flail.
[124:41.33]I don't wonder what Wizard of Oz character wanted that.
[124:47.56]Yes?
[125:06.85]This guy's still alive?
[125:07.89]Wow.
[125:08.38]Yes, I'm doing fine.
[125:10.10]Alright, if I do... We do fire and ice.
[125:19.50]Fire, ice, and poison.
[125:21.94]All in one.
[125:24.00]Alright, yeah.
[125:25.52]Let's go to the fountain drink thing and just get like Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite, Pepsi, Hi-C.
[125:33.33]Let's just do it all.
[125:42.92]This is 8 to 12 fire damage.
[125:45.78]The 5% life per hit is not going to do it for me.
[125:52.31]Let's go.
[125:53.45]Look, later on in the game, he's going to drop all the time anyways.
[126:04.48]Oh, shit!
[126:04.98]5 to 30 fire damage?! !
[126:10.99]Oh, that's pretty good.
[126:12.73]Oh, shit.
[126:13.23]I got two of these.
[126:14.57]I got two of these.
[126:15.77]No, we're just going Diet Coke.
[126:17.11]We're just going to go Diet Coke.
[126:21.95]Alright.
[126:23.70]18 to 72 fire damage.
[126:27.58]And I got a... Alright.
[126:28.80]Let's see.
[126:31.44]Oh, fuck yeah.
[126:32.42]Let's go.
[126:32.78]35 to 103 damage.
[126:34.90]It's just raw, raw.
[126:44.96]What class are we again?
[126:46.58]We are summoning Necromancer, but Chad is doing this laugh-out-loud scenario where they put most of my points into strength.
[126:57.05]So if I'm going to have more than 60 to 100 strength, then I might as well swing a weapon at somebody, because they've not given me any offensive move.
[127:06.62]I have a shield and a bunch of skeleton friends.
[127:09.28]That's it.
[127:14.05]This is just what's happening.
[127:16.69]Look at this thing.
[127:17.30]See, like, the red?
[127:17.96]See the red?
[127:22.80]Yep.
[127:29.58]Alright, Kaleem's heart is in the sewers under the Curest Bazaar.
[127:40.09]This guy's complaining, even though he's got one tooth.
[127:44.64]Yeah, no, I do have an offensive ability.
[127:47.62]Let's see how much damage it does.
[127:50.37]Teeth, yeah, okay.
[127:54.49]Right, okay, so that's... That's comparable.
[128:08.38]Alright, wait, no, no, no.
[128:09.16]I gotta go back to this place.
[128:10.54]We gotta go back up to the Flare Jungle.
[128:17.13]Not me.
[128:17.45]I want you to succeed.
[128:18.29]That's why I'm clicking on Constitution every time.
[128:21.07]Thanks.
[128:23.62]Dentist build?
[128:24.96]You can do a dentist build.
[128:27.86]You just put all your points into teeth.
[128:30.78]And then all your points into bone spear and shit.
[128:32.80]You can have like 50 teeth come up.
[128:39.80]Dude, I'm gonna destroy everybody with this build.
[128:49.95]I'm doing a lot of damage.
[128:51.23]This is without Amplify on.
[128:52.41]Am I really out of stamina?
[129:01.73]Tier list stream.
[129:03.77]Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[129:04.55]Alright, next level up I'm going to do the next tier list.
[129:24.19]We're going to keep going up to the Curest Bazaar.
[129:26.77]I believe it's this way.
[129:33.41]No, it's not.
[129:35.69]This way.
[129:48.70]That's pretty good.
[129:50.80]Dirt.
[129:52.60]Poison.
[129:54.87]Uh-huh.
[129:55.41]That was the Gitmin.
[129:59.49]Hang a right.
[130:05.87]Let's get to the bazaar.
[130:20.01]I thought they were on the other team for a second.
[130:26.64]Uh, no, keep going up.
[130:29.14]We can't.
[130:30.68]Where are the trees?
[130:32.34]The weird tree enemies are scary.
[130:33.68]Come on, I missed three times.
[130:35.40]Bone Master needs bone abilities.
[131:00.91]This is the next part, maybe?
[131:06.79]I don't know.
[131:07.67]I don't remember.
[131:11.45]See the fire when I hit people?
[131:13.43]So cool.
[131:14.39]See that little explosion?
[131:18.36]It goes.
[131:31.98]Why are you killing me?
[131:38.08]This is a war for good.
[131:39.46]This is a war for good and evil, man.
[131:45.77]This is hell.
[131:46.67]This is demons versus the rest of us.
[131:48.27]Easy.
[132:03.74]This is demons versus me and you.
[132:06.96]Alright, wrong way.
[132:17.89]Everyone's still alive.
[132:18.61]This is pretty great.
[132:23.77]You're with the demons?
[132:26.69]How could you?
[132:29.82]Traitor.
[132:32.67]Oh, Iron Golem's dead.
[132:38.50]I mean, there was too much... Overwhelming.
[132:40.70]Overwhelming.
[132:42.02]You're gonna close the game?
[132:58.35]What?
[132:59.01]Hardcore for my minions too?
[133:01.87]Oh, fuck!
[133:02.85]That was bad.
[133:05.15]That could have been... How long until Fire Golem, friend, people heaven?
[133:30.75]uh we need four more levels I'm assuming before we finish act three you'll see uh fire golem maybe ends and if your fellow chat members also would like to see that quite indecisive recently alright please spread out I don't like being spread out
[134:15.09]If I'm going to hold things in my inventory, I might as well just see what they are.
[134:18.70]On the way to the Bazaar.
[134:37.32]I'm going to use Cane to identify things.
[134:39.46]Because on the fly, I might want it.
[134:42.68]Plus, there's not that much money.
[134:45.84]I'm like, this might be better than what I have on right now.
[134:48.88]I don't want to go home for this.
[134:51.41]I mean, it's not, but it could have been.
[134:53.51]But yeah, it is.
[134:55.57]No, it's not.
[134:56.01]That's actually good, too.
[134:57.13]5% chance to cast Frost Nova.
[134:58.21]That's where that's coming from.
[135:05.61]You're impatient.
[135:07.39]That's what the point of the book is for.
[135:10.12]So I can trash shit that I know I don't want.
[135:11.78]I don't want to keep going back to town.
[135:14.46]That's too, it's too far.
[135:29.38]Alright, do I have enough for just even a shitty rune ward?
[135:36.03]I know there's dozens and dozens and dozens of them in the game, but do I have any of the crappy ones?
[135:47.22]Two or three slot armor?
[135:51.96]What about three?
[135:59.96]I'll F, huh?
[136:03.10]It's called stealth.
[136:05.14]I might want to look that up.
[136:08.90]It's here.
[136:15.68]Stealth would be pretty good.
[136:19.84]Try Fah?
[136:21.98]Is that Fah?
[136:22.84]That's not even a real thing.
[136:28.62]What are you trying to get me to say?
[136:29.90]Okay, I'm trying to figure out what you... What are you trying to get me to say?
[136:35.82]Here's my fart.
[136:42.56]Fart.
[136:43.06]Okay, but wouldn't it be just...
[136:53.92]Come on.
[136:54.30]I hope I don't miss anything.
[137:01.65]I still only have level one bone armor.
[137:11.83]Yeah, that's right.
[137:12.61]Mr. Peanut fucking died.
[137:13.87]We talked about it in the free stream chat.
[137:19.42]We went over this for like 40 minutes, but imagine nobody caring about Peanuts to the point where you have to kill one of the most iconic food brand mascots.
[137:35.03]And not just like, oh, we're discontinuing the use of Mr. Peanut.
[137:37.83]No, we're going to kill him.
[137:50.11]Super Bowl marketing shit.
[137:51.57]I have to go back around.
[137:59.77]Wait, really?
[138:00.35]Yes, really.
[138:01.43]Yes.
[138:03.61]We've gone full... Full kill somebody for memes.
[138:18.82]And I brought this up too.
[138:19.74]It's a really important point.
[138:21.96]I'm surprised none of, like, the other serial characters have died.
[138:27.55]Like, doesn't Sonny the Cocoa Puff Bird do crazy shit and, like, jump out of planes without parachutes and, like, crash his car into stuff?
[138:36.63]How is he still alive?
[138:52.85]Like the Trix rabbit stalks children and steals from them.
[138:58.83]Should we be in prison by now?
[139:01.85]Okay, that was fucking close.
[139:15.23]That fire move is so deadly.
[139:18.27]That's the run killer.
[139:27.29]I need fire resistance.
[139:29.40]I don't even care if I can put it on, even if I take something good off.
[139:32.06]Is this it?
[139:45.93]Alright, here we go.
[139:48.11]Player jungle, finally.
[139:51.13]And from here we're going to go to lower Curass and then Curass Bazaar.
[139:56.29]Mr. Peanut Wiki.
[139:59.74]Yes, some of the other mask food mascots live so much more dangerous lives than Mr. Peanut.
[140:17.33]How often did Captain Crunch get raided by other pirates?
[140:21.74]They had like swords and guns and stuff Tony the Tiger played soccer He could have taken a football a soccer ball right in the mouth and like broke his face and shit Mr. Peanut just dances
[140:50.95]He just dances.
[140:51.69]He just dances around.
[140:52.73]He's just, oh, Mr. Peanut, my PB crisps.
[140:55.60]It's not like he's doing anything dangerous.
[141:02.70]Speaking of PB crisps.
[141:09.35]Can they sacrifice Mr. Peanut to bring back PB crisps?
[141:14.57]Is that what this whole thing is for?
[141:15.94]Alright, here's my prediction.
[141:18.50]Super Bowl ad.
[141:19.28]PB Crisps is coming back.
[141:21.92]And this was just a big thing for him to reveal that PB Crisps are returning and not really dead.
[141:27.86]This is a big marketing ploy to bring back PB Crisps.
[141:30.24]The only product that anyone buys from Planters that ever did buy.
[141:39.25]And I have a theory that the reason why they discontinued him, and they're like, oh, no, maybe one day we'll bring him back.
[141:44.11]No, they were delicious.
[141:46.21]What were they made out of?
[141:47.98]You know, what's the big secret as to why everyone wants them?
[141:51.48]Everyone loves those things.
[141:52.36]Why'd they get rid of them?
[141:56.72]Yeah, oh, everyone loves PB Crisps.
[141:58.50]Mmm, yummy peanut cream in the middle.
[142:01.71]But what chemical was in there?
[142:06.73]I'm saying, like, why won't they bring him back?
[142:09.92]Ah, shit, we can't bring back the original recipe.
[142:11.84]They were good, though.
[142:26.61]These things are so awesome.
[142:27.33]I used to, in my mouth, I would separate the outer shell of the crisp and separate the inside peanut butter, eat the shell first, and then I would eat the peanut butter in the middle afterwards.
[142:37.69]You all did it, and it was the best thing you've ever done.
[142:46.02]Or I would peel the shell around it, eat it, and then take that solid, creamy peanut butter and put it and eat it.
[142:55.36]I actually have to go.
[143:02.08]Good day.
[143:02.93]You're fucked up.
[143:04.91]No.
[143:05.45]That... And these are coming from the people that told me that they eat Reese's.
[143:10.69]They like stick their tongue through the middle.
[143:13.35]And like push up, smear out the peanut butter.
[143:16.20]And then put it into their hand.
[143:17.78]And eat it.
[143:18.24]And then break the ring in half.
[143:20.04]I told you guys that I eat Reese's just normally.
[143:21.92]And it was like, what?
[143:24.41]You're a serial killer.
[143:29.43]Like, I... In Oreos, I talked about Oreos.
[143:31.86]I eat Oreos just normally.
[143:33.10]I dunk them in milk and I just eat them.
[143:35.84]You don't twist them and, like, rub your feet on them and then sit on them and then blow your nose on it and then eat it?
[143:43.34]No, I don't.
[143:58.47]I thought you said you dunked Reese's in milk.
[144:00.86]No, I dunked cookies in milk.
[144:03.60]Do I have another, uh... Just sell it, whatever.
[144:09.30]I'm gonna gamble.
[144:13.02]I know it's pronounced Reese's, but Reese's is how I say it.
[144:19.89]Reese's, you know, with different countries, different dialects, you know, like Reese's.
[144:25.01]That's how we say it here.
[144:31.10]Got a flawed skull in here.
[144:32.12]I need these Greater Health Potions.
[144:40.57]Alright, I'm just gonna sell it.
[144:43.35]I don't want it.
[144:46.45]I haven't repaired in a long time.
[144:47.63]I want sweets so bad right now.
[144:52.12]And I don't blame you, they're really delicious.
[145:03.14]I don't blame you.
[145:10.25]Bagged milk, yes or no?
[145:13.31]Um... I don't... I don't know.
[145:18.39]Alright, here we go.
[145:21.16]You know what I'm about to do with this.
[145:22.26]Die and be reborn.
[145:35.69]I can't.
[145:36.03]It's not made out of milk.
[145:43.55]I'll figure out what to do with it.
[145:49.38]How do I speed up a stream?
[145:52.92]You leave the stream.
[145:54.82]You go to sleep.
[145:55.83]Go take like a two hour nap and come back to your chair.
[145:58.91]That should do it.
[146:10.78]You need to go faster.
[146:11.82]There is no such thing as going faster in an ARPG.
[146:17.08]You gotta take it slow and steady.
[146:21.80]We're not trying to win any race.
[146:24.63]Just trying to continue.
[146:26.53]Wait, that was the right way.
[146:29.23]Wasn't it?
[146:34.03]We'll get a pizza instead.
[146:39.86]Isn't it up this way?
[146:40.60]God damn it, I need potions.
[146:45.95]Go back, go back, go back, go back, go back.
[146:47.97]I'm gonna buy stamina potions.
[146:50.37]Uh, cat, I'm not gonna answer that question.
[147:00.46]I'm gonna just, I'm gonna DM you.
[147:17.61]Alright, did I... I thought I was there.
[147:20.49]Apparently not.
[147:22.06]I need to know if I beat your record.
[147:36.15]Um... No, we... I... I used to bring the computer into the bathroom.
[147:45.79]I used to bring either a laptop... I would bring my whole computer into the bathroom.
[147:50.96]A lot of long-term viewers know this.
[147:53.02]When I was younger, I wanted to play so bad and just chill and relax.
[147:58.78]So I would bring my entire computer into the bathroom, plug it in and shit, and sit on the toilet and have a little desk, a little, like, card table.
[148:07.03]And I would sit there for, like, two hours.
[148:12.65]There we go, Laura Cura.
[148:23.12]And it would be so irritating.
[148:26.12]Because after I was done, I had to take it all apart and put it all back where it was supposed to be.
[148:35.04]And it was the biggest pain in the ass.
[148:43.67]Can you imagine being my parents?
[148:45.65]Because I didn't have headphones, I had like little speakers.
[148:50.78]Imagine being my parents and knowing that your son was in the bathroom.
[148:58.28]And you hear a battle scenario.
[149:02.42]This is what you listen to.
[149:05.06]What you're hearing right now.
[149:10.97]And you come back every 20 minutes and you still hear this.
[149:15.01]Like, what is he doing?
[149:26.17]I need the sewers under the Kuras Bazaar.
[149:30.25]There's also a skill book here, or a stat book.
[149:47.29]He must have eaten something funny.
[149:52.39]Well, I don't know.
[149:52.93]My, you cooked it.
[150:01.42]Now imagine if I had the opportunity to be playing online with a mic in my hand.
[150:10.92]You just hear that toilet flush sound.
[150:13.63]Dude, you couldn't mute microphones back then.
[150:21.81]And people still don't even mute their mics anymore.
[150:25.88]You think that's some kind of issue?
[150:27.38]How many times have you heard somebody's ceiling fan?
[150:39.26]Somebody comes into a lobby with their gain up to 100% and it's just like...
[150:59.09]And then they do this huge, just ear-piercing, blow out the microphone, 100% gain, cough into the microphone, and it's like, and you rip the headset off.
[151:11.24]It's like, Where is Bazar?
[151:36.68]Bags of Taco Bell crumbling at max gain.
[151:39.42]Yeah, the potato chip bag.
[151:47.34]It sounds like they're just walking over shattered glass in your ears.
[151:51.96]I think it's up here.
[152:03.28]No, no, no, no, no.
[152:13.04]Taco Bell has potato chips?
[152:15.64]Taco Bell has nachos.
[152:19.08]Ooh, where's the waypoint?
[152:21.16]I mean, they have corn chips, right?
[152:34.36]Somebody got mad at me for not opening chests.
[152:36.06]I'm doing it for that guy.
[152:39.35]Alright, here we go.
[152:39.79]The bazaar.
[152:41.23]We need to find the last piece of the puzzle.
[152:46.31]A tier... Alright, yeah.
[152:48.79]And after this level up, we're going to do a tier list.
[152:50.93]Chill for a sec.
[152:57.26]We're looking for the sewers.
[153:03.98]Sewers.
[153:04.56]Aren't there like six of these?
[153:06.92]Why am I saying it like this with all the S's?
[153:10.18]Sewers.
[153:12.58]It's in the sewers.
[153:15.34]It's inside the sewers.
[153:16.90]Fuck, now that sounds weird.
[153:25.51]This used to be a tier list stream.
[153:33.16]The S's are... I don't like the letter S anymore.
[153:38.86]Alright.
[153:45.74]What's it like being the number one Diablo II streamer on Twitch?
[153:49.04]Well... Real easy.
[153:52.26]When you play games that nobody plays.
[154:06.26]It's real easy to be number one when the closest number next to you is zero.
[154:22.37]Wacky wacky comedy stream!
[154:28.28]Is this sewers?
[154:36.41]You should stream more hearthstone.
[154:42.04]No, this is not the sewer.
[154:46.26]No, no, no, no.
[154:49.51]Not the sewer.
[154:50.27]Look at all this crap.
[154:55.91]Yeah, and whatever patch they last did, like two years, three years ago to this game, whatever it was, they upped the potion drops.
[155:05.43]Because holy shit, I've never seen this before.
[155:08.80]Even with the max players and shit.
[155:11.08]I used to do lobbies with eight people.
[155:17.06]There are other Diablo II streamers.
[155:18.40]I thought you said I was the only one.
[155:26.88]No, I've never played hardcore before.
[155:31.38]Sewers.
[155:34.79]I said you were number one.
[155:40.01]Oh, I thought you said that I was the only one.
[155:43.11]Like, I'm the only one.
[155:49.04]Hey, Sewers, I got it.
[155:56.11]Look at the ego on this guy.
[156:00.13]Level 2.
[156:00.97]Playing Barbarian here was really fun, because if you had Leap, you could just jump over, around, and everything.
[156:04.50]It was cool.
[156:05.00]One of the first experiences I ever had with this game was an old childhood friend of mine was in the sewers part here, and they were just doing Leap as Barbarian.
[156:13.81]I thought it was the coolest thing I've ever seen.
[156:25.09]Hey, new viewer here.
[156:25.77]Are you the shpee guy?
[156:34.75]It's weird to be a new viewer when Jerma is in your name.
[156:40.24]Hey, dude, new viewer.
[156:41.10]I've been on Twitch just browsing around and your name is in my name.
[156:48.30]Coincidence.
[156:48.82]It's weird.
[157:03.86]His name is also Jerma.
[157:08.16]Maybe.
[157:08.44]That would be weird.
[157:18.71]So are you the speed guy or no?
[157:22.69]No.
[157:24.79]I gave that up a long time ago.
[157:39.04]Maze.
[157:42.79]Stay healthy.
[157:44.03]Stay healthy.
[157:44.55]Stay healthy.
[157:47.29]Is this a hardcore thing?
[157:58.80]Is that what it is?
[158:17.71]I need level two.
[158:27.20]This is some kind of hardcore thing.
[158:28.94]I mean...
[158:46.35]Do you want to do a hot cool when I get off work?
[158:51.04]Okay, I'm fucking hot.
[158:53.22]Guess I had to jump.
[159:01.82]I'm killed.
[159:05.62]I think I got Vic here.
[159:12.71]Residents, sleeper, where's the commentary?
[159:16.92]People are fucking trying to sleep.
[159:21.77]Oh!
[159:22.51]Green, green, green, green.
[159:24.25]I think it's the same one I have.
[159:28.83]Berserkers.
[159:29.83]Ooh.
[159:31.77]Do I have any berserkers?
[159:33.88]I got a skeleton.
[159:38.30]Five people are trying to sleep.
[159:48.04]That's what I'm saying.
[159:48.78]People are trying to fucking sleep.
[159:50.98]Um, this isn't kind of better.
[159:52.18]That's fire resist, though.
[159:54.58]I know who would wear this.
[159:57.73]No berserker's, yeah.
[160:02.35]He's got 75 fire resistance.
[160:03.85]That guy's ready to go.
[160:08.54]Nancy Drew Napping Room.
[160:18.87]Key filter waiting room.
[160:25.30]Not that way.
[160:30.09]Do hogs want to get off work?
[160:34.63]I'm playing Necro, dude.
[160:40.19]It's really fucking odd.
[160:46.45]What are you going to do, a bathtub stream?
[160:50.51]Throw my camera on right now until I'm in the bathtub.
[160:53.07]Can we get some pogs in the chat to wake up these... I was going to say idiots, but if you're tired, you're not an idiot, you're just tired.
[161:24.39]Almost time for a level up, which means it's almost time for a tier list.
[161:28.08]A tier list?
[161:28.88]You said it?
[161:29.40]Alright, I'm getting up.
[161:34.30]I just shook the bag of dog treats.
[161:36.75]What?
[161:36.99]What's that?
[161:37.71]Oh, yeah.
[161:38.19]Okay, I'm ready.
[161:46.36]Shit.
[161:46.96]It's starting to get dangerous.
[162:00.91]I really do need to find... I might have to do some Vandariel runs after this.
[162:04.83]Before I go to Mephisto, I think I have to do a couple of Vandariel runs.
[162:10.23]I mean, I'm kind of getting beat up.
[162:12.96]If I get hit once, it's like, ow.
[162:20.12]Remember, you promised pictures of Otto in this bed.
[162:21.98]Lied about Otto.
[162:29.53]Hi, everybody.
[162:30.23]My name is Otto.
[162:31.05]This is my movie.
[162:32.45]I remember that video.
[162:34.09]A wink?
[162:37.31]A wink?
[162:42.97]You gotta wink.
[162:46.80]Oh yeah, I'm green!
[162:53.04]This actually looks weird because it looks kind of real.
[162:55.10]There you go.
[163:06.75]Red teeth?
[163:09.97]I'm not doing that.
[163:10.55]Okay.
[163:13.46]Did you wink?
[163:13.88]You got blood in his mouth.
[163:19.53]Yeah, every time I'm about to die, I just flinch down my teeth and squish hard!
[163:28.43]Level 2.
[163:29.49]No!
[163:30.11]Upper Curast, get out of here.
[163:36.72]Your teeth shouldn't be squishing.
[163:42.61]No, they shouldn't.
[163:44.01]You're right, they shouldn't.
[163:44.89]Maybe I should see a doctor.
[163:47.83]Squishy teeth.
[163:48.99]That's disgusting.
[164:25.24]Sewers are so huge.
[164:26.98]Don't run that far without... I don't have anything to do.
[164:29.50]I keep forgetting that I have... I'm 100% useless.
[164:35.12]I am nothing without a group of people with me.
[164:38.52]I can't run forward without everybody.
[164:40.69]I don't even have any moves.
[164:43.47]I don't have any spells or abilities.
[164:47.47]Why would I run forward?
[164:51.79]I run forward to run back.
[165:13.24]What's the next tier list?
[165:14.02]I wonder.
[165:14.48]Let's take a look.
[165:17.28]I think we got, uh, Jim Carrey movies is coming up soon.
[165:24.78]Dude, the Jerma985 face emotes.
[165:30.68]No, what?
[165:31.04]The Jerma 9- Jerma faces.
[165:34.32]I'm going to raid my own faces.
[165:37.16]Don't you guys call me an egomaniac all the time?
[165:39.30]Don't you think that that would be solidifying what you're saying?
[165:53.41]Did I miss that up there?
[165:55.01]No, that was to the upper bazaar.
[166:00.93]Fuck, this is huge.
[166:10.17]Do it, for the love of God!
[166:11.15]Ar- Mike, hold on!
[166:12.83]Are you guys, like, stamping your feet?
[166:18.73]Do it, do it, do it!
[166:21.85]Do it, do it!
[166:24.10]I'm not supposed to reward this kind of behavior.
[166:44.92]I need a heart Do or we're all gonna leave This is one of those scenarios where you say we're gonna leave right guys and everyone's like yeah And I don't do it and you're like fine.
[167:03.43]Let's get the fuck out of here right guys Everyone's like yeah, let's go
[167:07.78]Then you and two people leave.
[167:15.84]Then you look back and you realize that it's just you two.
[167:22.62]And then you can't come back because that would be... You can't... Oh, well, I thought everyone was going to go with us.
[167:28.52]Oh, I can't go back there because that means I'm going to sit back down and...
[167:37.31]Alright, need more.
[167:39.61]Is my... Oh, he's still alive.
[167:42.52]5,000 viewers gone.

[170:27.06]There's really nothing else down here.
[170:28.44]Where's... Do I have to go... I don't think I have to go to level 2.
[170:30.28]I don't think there is a level 2.
[170:31.53]Is there?
[170:31.79]Oh my goodness.
[170:45.71]Oh my goodness.

[171:24.29]Old Enchanted, I was teleporting.
[171:25.51]That's why we can't kill him.
[171:31.66]These guys are annoying.
[171:40.88]There it is.
[171:42.06]Zero Lever, finally.
[171:45.27]Wait, we gotta kill that guy.
[171:46.67]Where is he?
[171:48.21]Teleporter.
[171:51.39]Belt.
[171:55.71]Sucks.
[171:58.91]It sucks.
[172:02.35]Alright, level two.
[172:03.33]Let's get the thing we need and then get the hell out of here.
[172:05.25]And then we'll do a tier list after we level up.
[172:08.99]What do you think?
[172:09.39]You feeling maybe Jim Carrey movies?
[172:12.77]Jeremy's face up there too?
[172:15.73]Okay.
[172:38.71]Come on, give me a rare.
[172:47.17]Unique.
[172:51.66]Oh, I didn't even see what it was until I clicked on it.
[173:04.13]Gleam's heart.
[173:06.37]It's a gem shrine.
[173:07.45]A gem shrine just automatically upgrades any gem in your inventory to the next tier.
[173:12.25]So I could have brought a regular gem here and it would have been upgraded to a flawless gem.
[173:16.49]And that's when I cried.
[173:19.41]Alright, what do we got?
[173:23.22]Search for Kaleem's Flail in Trevinsial.
[173:25.60]Beware of the High Council.
[173:31.95]You have found Kaleem's heart, and it still bears the courage to face Mephisto.
[173:38.31]Place it in the Haradric Cube along with Kaleem's other relics.
[173:42.61]The eye, the brain, and the flail.
[173:45.65]Counsel.
[173:54.87]Now I need the flail, and we make the super flail.
[174:02.09]One, two, three.
[174:11.21]Skull.
[174:13.57]You put a perfect skull in a weapon.
[174:14.83]It's pretty great, especially if you have a bow if you're an Amazon.
[174:19.69]They're very, very good with Amazons, especially if you get wind force.
[174:23.43]Socketed wind force, perfect skull.
[174:27.25]I know a bunch of people just are going to say that I've ruined the item by doing that.
[174:30.69]I don't care.
[174:31.69]Fine.
[174:41.05]Yes.
[174:41.25]Alright.
[174:45.48]Bell, bell, bell.
[174:46.72]Okay.
[174:55.23]Let's go in there.
[175:00.41]Bell.
[175:02.19]And do I have enough of these?
[175:03.21]No.
[175:03.27]Alright.
[175:09.00]Look at the skills.
[175:10.36]We are level 27.
[175:10.90]For a reminder, there is what we have available.
[175:15.65]Iron Golem.

[175:24.09]Skeleton Mage.
[175:27.38]Poison and Bone Teeth.
[175:28.88]Bone Armor.
[175:31.74]What synergies help Fire Golem?
[175:34.92]all the golem ones so summon resist golem mastery clay blood and iron all give a bonus to fire just as fire gives a bonus to all the other ones as well every point that is put into blood golem gives plus five percent health per level to every other golem
[175:59.96]Same thing with clay.
[176:01.00]Every point that's in clay gives plus 20 attack rating to every other golem.
[176:10.41]Curses.
[176:10.83]I feel like you guys want to look at these for a second because just bear with me.
[176:16.31]Life tap.
[176:18.77]Think about this just for a moment.
[176:20.87]I'm not influencing you.
[176:23.05]Anybody that's cursed by this becomes a 50% life leech to anybody that swings anything at them.
[176:34.76]Ah.
[176:35.78]Confuse.
[176:37.20]Confuses monsters to force it to attack random targets.
[176:40.64]Mm-hmm.
[176:42.08]Attract.
[176:42.48]It's just a taunt on somebody that didn't taunt.
[176:44.58]Decrepify.
[176:46.87]Causes a group of enemies to make them slow, weak, take more damage.
[176:56.51]Iron Maiden is 200% Thorns at level 1.
[177:05.48]Man, we're getting residents sleep.
[177:06.58]Alright, what do you want?
[177:12.00]Which one?
[177:15.61]That is up to date.
[177:25.52]Pick something?
[177:26.32]Nice.
[177:42.28]Hmm.
[177:46.89]I can't click fire.
[177:48.83]Fire does not exist for three more levels.
[178:03.10]If it's not more friends, I don't care.
[178:05.08]People happy.
[178:14.00]We got 18.
[178:15.12]What's the one above?
[178:15.82]What's iron?
[178:28.11]What percentage is actually clicking on iron?
[178:33.81]And I know that some of you are doing this on purpose.
[178:36.21]When you click here, that doesn't help any of us.
[178:42.57]It's here.
[178:45.00]Or here?
[178:47.16]Not here.
[178:57.59]Alright, it's going into iron.
[179:05.29]What about the stats?
[179:15.19]I'm just teaching you guys what a button is.
[179:16.71]Like, y'all are three.
[179:17.83]What is that?
[179:20.33]You guys...
[179:46.01]more strength that's what this is big and strong I'm the strongest person here in my group that has trouble fighting things
[180:13.81]So, I don't know what this is.
[180:16.78]This is, I think it was strength.
[180:21.32]That's probably, that's strength.
[180:24.54]Do both.
[180:28.94]Two and two.
[180:30.36]And one streamer's choice.
[180:31.38]Alright, make it more clear, please.
[181:03.61]Look at this.
[181:04.45]Look at the face of somebody.
[181:05.31]There's people clicking right in the middle.
[181:09.19]Yeah.
[181:09.83]Make the giant slug.
[181:11.47]Make the caterpillar.
[181:25.18]Can you make the caterpillar?
[181:26.58]Oh, you did it.
[181:27.64]Thanks for voting.
[181:46.42]Iron Golem.
[181:56.63]Hey, I gotta... I gotta make a decision here.
[182:01.99]Cat picks everything.
[182:04.44]That is what happened.
[182:06.26]You were having fun.
[182:07.26]You were memeing around.
[182:09.88]But we've got a destination.
[182:17.55]So now our Iron Golem is at 180% damage returned.
[182:25.46]And a shitload more defense.
[182:28.54]Very good.
[182:31.16]Alright, let's do the Jerm of Face tier list.
[182:35.22]Uh, where is it?
[182:35.72]I wasn't trying to do that.
[182:41.61]I was trying to go back.
[182:47.27]I was hitting back on my browser to try to find the music I had.
[182:50.59]Oh well.
[182:54.02]What do you think I'm doing?
[182:55.00]Jerma's face is fixed.
[183:07.83]Do the fixed one.
[183:08.83]Okay.
[183:13.19]Why does it have to be fixed?
[183:14.09]Why is it fixed?
[183:20.77]Hey, this one's fixed.
[183:30.11]Alright, reptiles is done.
[183:31.24]Alright, let's do it.
[183:32.26]Let's see what we got.
[183:34.88]I don't even... I can't even... Alright, this is gonna be... This is gonna take a little while.
[183:42.15]No, it's not.
[183:42.91]It's just my face, like, fucking 40 times...
[183:51.56]I don't have time to change this, I don't care.
[183:54.50]Alright.
[184:04.41]So, uh, this is the Germaface tier list.
[184:15.48]Wait, maybe I can, no.
[184:17.48]Demonize?
[184:31.01]Okay, here we go.
[184:33.16]I'm normal now.
[184:33.98]I gotta make sure I'm perfectly framed!
[184:46.83]Alright, let's go.
[185:14.02]That's a fun memory that I had.
[185:31.44]I love that image just like one of my favorites that could be a different person You know that this is a different person It's not even the same human being This is not even me
[186:01.37]Oh, this Jerma Rumble.
[186:02.35]Come on.
[186:02.59]That's like some of the most fun I've ever had.
[186:08.40]And that was when they announced that they were working on Elder Scrolls 6.
[186:17.37]And I'm so excited for it.
[186:25.05]Is it 6 or is it 7?
[186:35.84]It's 8.
[186:36.28]Turn off the music.
[186:40.58]This music is kind of fucked up.
[186:43.53]This is like funeral music.
[186:55.42]I'm keeping it.
[186:59.49]Alright.
[187:03.58]I was a handsome, I was a handsome young man.
[187:07.04]This is going up to fucking B tier.
[187:22.59]These are like both from, this is doctored.
[187:25.95]Why, this is not even my faces, these are doctored images.
[187:37.73]This is just me playing a game on facecam.
[187:41.19]That's the worst one.
[187:56.55]This is the worst one.
[187:57.27]I hate this fucking image.
[188:01.38]When I go out to places and people ask, what do you do?
[188:04.94]People find out that I stream, right?
[188:07.43]Hey, oh, you stream.
[188:09.05]Oh, nice.
[188:09.47]Now, what's your channel name?
[188:11.13]I fucking hate telling them.
[188:13.35]Because that's the image that pops up if you type in Jerma into Google.
[188:17.01]That's just what pops up.
[188:18.97]So, it's just so ugly and gross and just, I look like unkempt and unwell.
[188:26.30]It's just such a bad picture that
[188:33.68]It's so bad.
[188:35.64]And it has to be everywhere.
[188:36.84]It has to be the number one image search.
[188:38.64]It has to be the number one thing that's on every wiki.
[188:42.45]Like, why can't it be... I'd rather it be this one.
[188:45.45]I mean, at least this one's a joke.
[188:46.83]This is me scary looking into a camera.
[188:49.91]Like, I'm coming.
[188:51.47]And I'm fucking mad.
[188:53.20]This one's a joke, you know what I mean?
[188:58.66]This is deranged.
[188:59.58]This is humor.
[189:08.37]Did I disqualify this one?
[189:09.33]It's not even a face.
[189:15.07]Does this mean... Oh, this is right, because I wasn't... This is me naked.
[189:18.88]This is going to take some refinement.
[189:26.26]This is up pretty high for me.
[189:28.06]That's up pretty high for me.
[189:30.16]How's this one?
[189:37.01]This one sucks.
[189:38.13]This one's just a worse version of this one.
[189:53.94]He can be the best or the worst because it's not even my face.
[189:55.76]There's a lot of D faces here.
[190:06.34]Mustache hair has to be up kind of high.
[190:08.10]This is just like a Twitter picture I took one time.
[190:14.78]This one's alright.
[190:15.92]I'll just do some refinement.
[190:17.00]This one sucks.
[190:18.12]This one's just like a stretched out image of my face.
[190:20.16]Alright.
[190:22.42]What's the best face?
[190:33.79]It's my favorite image.
[190:56.67]Could be.
[190:57.23]Could be accurate.
[190:59.07]It's accurate.
[191:01.57]Okay.
[191:01.71]There's a story behind this one.
[191:04.24]There's a story behind all of these.
[191:10.39]But this one, I think, has so much going on in this one.
[191:13.59]Because of the circumstance.
[191:17.93]Alright, let's get down here.
[191:25.72]I like it, but it's old.
[191:27.80]No, these are new.
[191:31.54]What's this even from?
[191:34.71]What is this?
[191:35.31]This looks like it's not taken from here.
[191:36.97]This is taken from some other place.
[191:40.99]From where?
[191:44.09]Was it the green screen?
[191:46.27]The awards.
[191:47.73]Oh, okay.
[191:48.11]The awards.
[191:48.53]Alright.
[191:54.78]That's pretty good.
[192:06.23]This one's so stupid.
[192:07.59]Is the clown better than all these, though?
[192:09.67]You know when you have a wicked itchy ear?
[192:14.02]Like, inside your ear?
[192:15.96]And I can't reach that far.
[192:18.12]I want to take, like, a little device and go in and just, like, scratch.
[192:21.20]But that's so bad for you.
[192:25.38]It's like... No, you're not supposed to put Q-tips in your ears.
[192:30.40]You're really not.
[192:32.56]Well, everybody does.
[192:33.44]It's funny that we all say that to each other.
[192:35.38]Now, don't put Q-tips in your ears.
[192:37.10]Yes, everyone, every single person does it.
[192:39.64]Everyone says don't do it, but all of us do it.
[192:41.96]Why?
[192:44.20]Why can't we just come clean about that?
[192:47.80]No, don't fucking do that.
[192:51.04]Not good for you.
[192:53.16]Did it this morning.
[193:27.77]I'm working on it.
[193:28.43]I'm working.
[193:37.29]What's the worst possible face?
[193:39.15]It's probably this one.
[193:40.15]It's just me.
[193:40.69]These two.
[193:46.49]No, it's this one.
[193:52.85]Yep.
[193:54.45]What's the best?
[193:55.19]Alright, this one's really bad too.
[193:56.57]So is this one.
[193:57.15]So is this one.
[193:59.75]So is this one.
[194:02.73]It's probably these are probably the best.
[194:05.34]So is this one.
[194:09.24]Yeah.
[194:09.46]Okay.
[194:16.06]Okay.
[194:19.18]No, these belong together because they're just like screen... They're just screen caps from a YouTube video.
[194:24.56]I wasn't making any faces here.
[194:26.75]I wasn't trying to be funny or do a joke.
[194:28.99]This is just you took a screen cap from two different videos from like 2012.
[194:37.08]Oy, this one's bad.
[194:41.82]Put these two together, you could say the same thing.
[195:11.80]It's funny when you can tell when they're from the same stream.
[195:21.07]Was it this bad one day?
[195:23.63]Was it this fucked up one day?
[195:29.83]What was going on on this stream?
[195:37.82]These could all be the same day.
[195:39.14]Alright, that's accurate.
[195:41.82]Yeah, this is accurate.
[195:46.56]It's because you have four shirts.
[195:55.63]I wear this green one all the time.
[195:57.59]Is the green one in any of these?
[196:04.09]No.
[196:06.19]Thank God.
[196:07.45]There you go.
[196:07.82]There's me raiding my own face.
[196:11.38]Not a narcissist, by the way.
[196:12.66]Not an egomaniac, by the way.
[196:23.07]The Joker face is too low.
[196:27.03]Are you sure the Joker face is better than mustache hair?
[196:34.30]Or scrunched McChicken face?
[196:40.18]Yeah, actually.
[196:40.88]Yeah, actually it is.
[196:42.88]Actually it is.
[196:43.88]This one's not even that good.
[196:45.96]Alright, you're right.
[196:48.73]This should be lower too.
[196:50.11]No, this is... This one should be way lower.
[196:54.79]Again, this is the same stream.
[197:04.19]you can tell look at the hair there's no coal miner here that's unfortunate you're right it's been so long since I've seen this original image what was going on why was the light blue
[197:35.69]You were doing the storytelling stream?
[197:39.16]Oh, right, right.
[197:43.96]Right.
[197:44.16]Okay.
[197:46.40]There you go.
[197:47.76]There's your second tier list.
[197:49.22]It only took three hours to do the second one.
[197:50.86]Can we do one more?
[197:54.18]We'll do one more.
[197:54.76]We'll do one more.
[197:57.05]Whatever this next one is.
[197:58.07]There's your list.
[198:01.01]What's this one?
[198:05.06]uh okay this is water this is drinking water it's different waters this is water to drink what is this what's that supposed to be it looks like car this is like car antifreeze fluid
[198:32.83]ice water but but who cares what's the water inside of it where'd it come from and that would oh this this is the sparkling water right water from the sink gross water from the toilet water from the bathtub
[199:00.42]If I don't drink it, I'm a bath hobbyist.
[199:04.96]We talked about my hobbies.
[199:06.04]Taking baths is a hobby.
[199:10.10]Can I put that up here?
[199:18.61]I take a bath like three times a week.
[199:21.61]I'm not making that up.
[199:22.39]I swear to God.
[199:24.46]I love it.
[199:28.02]And then I go under the water and I just go... It's not bad.
[199:44.72]He's a true gamer.
[199:50.08]This is from a river?
[199:51.50]No, you're gonna get a tapeworm.
[199:55.73]It's probably safer to drink toilet water than it is to drink water right out of a river.
[200:02.28]You're going to get like... I don't know.
[200:10.57]I know that's actually true.
[200:13.55]There's like all kinds of bacteria and contaminants.
[200:16.29]This is regulated.
[200:17.59]I mean, as long as nobody shipped it.
[200:21.41]I would probably... I don't know.
[200:22.51]That's tricky.
[200:24.35]Where's smart water?
[200:25.19]I don't know.
[200:25.55]It's not on here.
[200:30.79]What happened to Diablo?
[200:31.71]We're going back to it.
[200:32.85]We got caught up.
[200:34.65]What is domino?
[200:36.51]Diamond water?
[200:37.31]Not even close to being Fiji.
[200:38.61]I don't even know what it is.
[200:41.01]Alright, let's put the antifreeze over here.
[200:42.49]Alright, what's safer?
[200:44.43]Drinking antifreeze or drinking water out of a river?
[200:58.08]River of Water is safer than... Of course it is.
[201:03.80]I don't even know what these are.
[201:04.96]I'm just going to put them over on... D is like I don't... D is don't care.
[201:09.65]D is don't care because I've never had it.
[201:12.29]Drinking water from a pool.
[201:14.61]Alright, hold on.
[201:16.43]Drinking water tier list.
[201:21.27]You don't drink water from a pool.
[201:25.21]There's two things going on here.
[201:28.89]Alright, drinking water from a pool versus drinking water from a toilet.
[201:37.13]The toilet's probably safer.
[201:44.22]Is this a pool that just got shocked or chlorinated?
[201:47.40]Alright, yeah, so it's safer to drink out of a toilet than out of a pool.
[201:55.70]And we're not talking about, oh, you got a little bit up your nose, or you got a little bit in your mouth.
[201:58.56]No, we're talking about, like, we got, like, a full 16-ounce glass of water, right?
[202:02.53]Drinking, like, a full, like, 24-ounce glass.
[202:05.57]Like, downing it from the pool.
[202:08.63]Right, so that's, I don't know if I would do that.
[202:10.76]But I would, you know what, I'd probably do that before drinking water around the toilet.
[202:13.80]This is just too much to bear.
[202:18.01]I would do a full, like, 16 ounce glass of water from a pool, then 16 ounces from a toilet.
[202:23.03]But I would do toilet before I did, like, a random river that could have, like, E. coli in it.
[202:26.87]And I would do river after, before doing, drinking antifreeze.
[202:29.61]So, okay.
[202:31.49]Out of the ocean, you don't want to do that either.
[202:34.68]Out of a lake, you don't want to do that either.
[202:36.28]And then, I don't know what this is.
[202:41.44]Drink water from, this is much safer than, than this.
[202:48.79]Drinking water out of a lake is probably... Because the salt water... Salt water versus fresh water.
[202:53.67]They're both bad.
[202:58.22]River... Yeah, no, no, no.
[202:59.92]Standing water.
[203:00.82]That's even worse.
[203:05.90]I would drink a full glass out of a sea.
[203:10.45]Then a full glass out of a pool.
[203:13.27]Then a full glass out of a toilet.
[203:14.76]Then a full glass out of a river.
[203:17.26]Running water.
[203:17.84]It's moving.
[203:19.20]Standing water is mosquitoes, and I don't want to drink mosquito eggs.
[203:22.86]And then antifreeze.
[203:27.36]You would die.
[203:30.44]If I drank 16 ounces of salt water, I'm going to die.
[203:34.04]Sorry, guys.
[203:34.50]I used to drink Gatorade for no reason.
[203:37.02]It's the same thing.
[203:39.89]would die if I drank 16 ounces why is this the only water I get to have ever why is this the only water I get to drink why is if I drink 16 ounces of water you're not going to hydrate but it's going to kill you
[204:11.72]If I drink 16 ounce glass of water from the ocean, I die.
[204:15.56]I'm going to die.
[204:20.76]But what if I drank 16 ounces of ocean water and then a fucking full Dasani, right?
[204:29.57]What happens?
[204:39.49]They will negate each other.
[204:43.53]What are the circumstances?
[204:44.81]We didn't go over the circumstances.
[204:46.07]We didn't go over the rules.
[204:48.26]Am I trapped on an island?
[204:51.54]Am I the only person at the pool?
[204:54.74]Am I the only one using the toilet?
[204:57.34]There are no ground rules here.
[204:58.34]We haven't made them.
[205:05.05]I'm not drinking salt water to hydrate.
[205:06.83]I just... Is it safer to drink 16 ounces of salt water or 16 ounces of water from a chlorinated shocked fucking pool?
[205:15.65]They're both dangerous!
[205:17.99]But which one is worse?
[205:19.33]Pool is safer?
[205:32.48]You know how much pool water I've gotten in my eyes and in my nose and in my mouth?
[205:36.23]I've drank probably four or five glasses of this water before.
[205:39.33]And I'm alright.
[205:39.85]No, I don't believe it.
[205:54.69]This is the worst thing you can drink because there's mosquito eggs in like this standing water, standing lake water.
[206:01.70]You could actually, actually die.
[206:04.12]This, you're saying, it just dehydrates you.
[206:06.80]But if I'm not stranded on an island, I would be safer drinking this and then just drinking a glass of water and maybe like eating some bread or something.
[206:17.01]The salt water kills all the germs.
[206:38.40]Alright, alright.
[206:39.60]That's done.
[206:41.36]It's over.
[206:41.94]Arrowhead.
[206:42.68]Arrowhead's not better than Evian.
[206:45.40]And Evian's not better than Fiji.
[206:46.86]And I love taking baths.
[206:48.44]This is accurate.
[206:55.15]I'm not drinking this.
[207:01.34]You guys really gonna make me do this?
[207:03.80]Fine.
[207:04.40]It's safer to drink water out of your bathtub than any of these other things.
[207:09.95]Because who cares?
[207:10.71]It's just a bathtub.
[207:11.67]Because nobody shits in their bathtub.
[207:13.29]Nobody pisses in their bathtub.
[207:16.33]I like taking baths.
[207:17.37]It's not fair.
[207:27.65]Everyone pees in their bathtub.
[207:35.95]So let's get this straight.
[207:38.15]When I tell you that I've peed in the shower before, which to pee directly into a drain, and you don't have to sit in it, that's weird.
[207:47.05]But all of you guys are saying that you've pissed in your bathtub before, where you have to sit in your fucking bathtub and be surrounded by urine.
[207:57.23]But you're not weird.
[208:00.59]You're not weird.
[208:02.11]I'm weird.
[208:11.37]If you pee directly into the drain... If you pee directly into the drain, what's the difference?
[208:28.52]I want to know the difference.
[208:30.08]What's the difference?
[208:35.10]After you take the bath, you pee.
[208:37.28]You're just sitting in a bath.
[208:38.42]What are you talking about?
[208:39.30]This is done.
[208:51.05]It's accurate.
[208:56.17]You stand up and do it.
[209:00.41]I'm never going to your house.
[209:03.69]You put like the two or three towels out for me and you put it on the bathtub and you just hang them over there and you're like, yeah, I got a bathtub.
[209:08.75]I'm not going in that bathtub.
[209:16.45]Bathtub is kind of just a big urinal though.
[209:28.05]I guess I get it.
[209:29.11]I get it.
[209:31.07]What's the next one?
[209:35.25]I already did this one before.
[209:36.15]I'm just going to do it real quick.
[209:52.77]Fucking get some coffee from all these places.
[209:58.45]Alright, so this is, what's your favorite coffee?
[210:00.19]Just kidding.
[210:00.73]Where do you like, what's your favorite fast food restaurant?
[210:23.17]He's influencing.
[210:23.89]Alright, that was fun.
[210:25.31]What's this one?
[210:30.43]Alright, I want to do this one.
[210:32.11]I want to do this one.
[210:32.71]And then we're going back to Diablo.
[210:34.85]This is Jim Carrey movie.
[210:40.64]The Mask, number one.
[210:45.20]Alright, Jim Carrey movies.
[210:47.04]We've got Ace Ventura, get up there.
[210:50.30]Ace Ventura 2.
[210:52.43]Wait, no, no, no.
[210:53.05]Where's Ace Ventura 2?
[210:53.65]Ace Ventura 2 is way better than 1.
[210:59.25]Liar Liar is alright.
[211:00.51]Let's go.
[211:01.01]Dumb and Dumber is really good.
[211:03.55]I have not seen this.
[211:04.17]I'm going to put it down here.
[211:06.39]I didn't see this either.
[211:09.71]Oh, right.
[211:09.97]He was in this.
[211:10.69]It was alright.
[211:13.15]Oh, the number 23.
[211:14.53]Here it is.
[211:15.21]Whatever.
[211:18.43]Ace Ventura 2.
[211:19.95]When Nature Calls.
[211:20.67]There it is.
[211:22.50]Bruce Almighty was good.
[211:27.54]What's this?
[211:29.28]Oh, Dumber Dumber 2, no.
[211:32.71]Uh, Kick-Ass 2.
[211:33.59]Does it count if I've never watched Kick-Ass 2?
[211:37.29]I only watched Jim Carrey's scenes in the movie.
[211:40.13]Does it count?
[211:46.80]No?
[211:47.12]Yeah?
[211:49.74]Huh.
[211:52.72]Mr. Poppin's Penguins.
[211:53.86]Didn't see it.
[211:55.90]Me, myself, and Irene.
[211:56.92]I mean, it's a classic...
[211:59.50]Cable Guy.
[212:00.04]That's a classic.
[212:03.80]The Majestic.
[212:04.94]The movie theater one?
[212:11.29]Yes, man.
[212:16.03]The Dumb and Dumbers are backwards.
[212:19.27]Oh, yeah.
[212:19.59]You're right.
[212:22.16]Batman Forever.
[212:23.06]S. I didn't see this one.
[212:31.11]I didn't see this one.
[212:33.17]I didn't see this one.
[212:34.85]I didn't see this one.
[212:36.33]Christmas Carol.
[212:36.97]It's alright.
[212:38.23]Sonic the Hedgehog movie.
[212:39.65]Nobody's seen it yet.
[212:40.31]I haven't seen this one.
[212:44.65]I don't know.
[212:47.09]Birdman Show.
[212:47.84]Get up there.
[212:49.58]Man of the Moon.
[212:50.08]Get up there.
[212:51.34]Grinch.
[212:52.54]It's alright.
[212:52.94]I don't know.
[212:55.30]Oh, no.
[212:55.48]This is fun.
[212:56.14]I didn't see it.
[213:01.00]I didn't see this one.
[213:01.64]I don't even know what this one is.
[213:03.55]I don't know what this one is.
[213:04.91]Uh, I don't know what this one is.
[213:08.49]Uh, oh, this is... Okay.
[213:12.23]I don't know what this one is.
[213:13.17]I don't know what this one is.
[213:14.47]I don't know what this one is.
[213:16.41]Alright.
[213:16.65]Let's get this right.
[213:21.93]Oh, wait, that was Eternal Sunshine.
[213:23.05]Where is Eternal Sunshine?
[213:29.18]Which one is it?
[213:29.98]This one, okay.
[213:39.31]That's an accurate S-tier for Jim Carrey movies.
[213:45.78]Why would I put Eternal Sunshine next to The Mask?
[213:54.76]That's so far below it.
[213:56.64]But it's better.
[213:58.06]I mean, that's... That's inaccurate.
[214:00.75]The Mask is the best movie that he's ever done.
[214:03.21]It was incredible.
[214:03.81]He did everything.
[214:16.48]Okay, hold on.
[214:16.94]We're gonna have to bump something off, I think.
[214:20.98]Nope.
[214:24.42]Liar Liar was good, but I don't know if it was Cable Guy good.
[214:32.47]The Grinch goes up?
[214:33.23]No, The Grinch was like two hours too long.
[214:35.71]You shaved like three and a half hours off that movie, I would agree.
[214:40.46]uh I like Bruce almighty more than eternal sunshine
[215:08.34]What's the worst Jim Carrey movie that I've seen?
[215:10.46]I mean, they're both not very good.
[215:29.11]The Grinch feels like it was a day long.
[215:30.85]Yes, that's what happens when you take an old fun children's story that was 12 minutes long and you make it like a four and a half hour long movie.
[215:52.15]Remember, I just haven't seen these.
[215:54.27]So if you're like, oh, dark, dark crimes, that's great.
[215:56.77]I just haven't seen it.
[215:58.11]I don't know.
[216:00.57]Diablo II is in the background?
[216:01.73]Oh, it is?
[216:09.92]That movie's an hour and 32 minutes.
[216:13.34]Thanks for proving my point that we all thought it was like three and a half hours long.
[216:19.29]Again, it was like three hours too long.
[216:24.25]Great performance, though.
[216:25.03]It goes up.
[216:26.99]Fantastic performance by Jim Carrey.
[216:34.87]Preemptively rate Sonic S tier.
[216:36.73]That's a safe bet.
[216:37.77]I'm not sure that's a safe bet.
[216:40.93]I would probably assume that this is going to be up here somewhere, though.
[216:49.97]Is his Dr. Eggman performance going to be as good as his Yes Man performance?
[216:57.80]That's to be seen.
[217:02.12]Yes Man sucked.
[217:03.82]But why do you think it's right next to Burt Wonderstone?
[217:16.34]I don't know.
[217:16.62]Maybe we'll see.
[217:17.20]We'll see if it's a fun movie.
[217:19.60]It could be fun.
[217:24.34]It's one of the first Jim Carrey comedy kind of... He's going back to comedy.
[217:29.89]It's been a while.
[217:31.31]What, Dumb and Dumber 2 was the last time he was in a comedy movie, right?
[217:34.13]It's been like three or four years.
[217:39.01]And before that, it was a while, too.
[217:43.35]Six years.
[217:43.87]Remember, the bad taste in movies joke is getting old.
[217:51.06]If you think that this belongs somewhere else besides S, if you think these three belong somewhere else, I'm not sure what to tell you.
[218:00.52]I don't know how to explain to you these things.
[218:06.79]This is like the required reading for Jim Carrey movies.
[218:11.71]S and A tier is required Jim Carrey reading.
[218:19.21]He almost got an Academy Award for this.
[218:23.33]He got like a Golden Globe for Man on the Moon.
[218:25.33]It was great.
[218:30.87]Ace Ventura is overrated.
[218:34.73]I don't know.
[218:35.81]I mean, like, the second one's... The first one is... I like the second one better than the first one.
[218:47.42]And Eternal Sunshine was... I mean, whatever.
[218:49.14]It's alright.
[218:49.76]It's good.
[218:51.22]B doesn't mean a bad movie.
[218:52.28]B just means it's not... It's not the Truman Show.
[218:58.39]There's your list.
[218:59.03]Okay, now let's do Adam Sandler.
[219:12.53]You don't mess with the Zohan.
[219:19.10]Happy Gilmore Esther.
[219:23.28]I saw this movie in the theaters.
[219:26.14]Me and Burgah Boy saw this because we were like, oh, this has to be like the worst movie ever.
[219:30.52]It was hard for us to not get up and leave.
[219:31.82]We were just like, let's go fucking watch this shitty movie.
[219:36.20]And it was hard to stay and watch the whole thing.
[219:40.00]The only good part about that movie is the Al Pacino-Duncaccino song.
[219:48.10]That's it.
[219:49.56]That's the only thing that was worth watching in the whole movie.
[219:52.98]The ad.
[219:53.38]And it was just giant product placement.
[219:54.90]I don't even care.
[219:56.00]It was so stupid.
[220:01.50]Duncaccino is the only reason why that movie was even tolerable.
[220:05.60]Oh, the gobbler?
[220:06.80]No, the cobbler.
[220:07.38]I haven't seen it.
[220:09.80]D is haven't seen it.
[220:10.72]F is just, like, why?
[220:13.56]If the first dates didn't see it, I didn't have a reason to see it.
[220:18.37]Oh, this is a Boston movie.
[220:21.31]I'm always, like, fucking talking like fucking this all the fucking time.
[220:23.89]This is a Boston movie, so it has to be a C for me.
[220:29.71]Um...
[220:35.19]Wedding Singer was alright, but I'm not a huge Wedding Singer fan.
[220:40.45]Why is Hotel Transylvania on here, but not with Eight Crazy Nights?
[220:45.03]Where is it?
[220:45.31]Alright, I think this is good.
[221:07.30]Big Daddy better than, uh, yeah.
[221:17.83]There we go.
[221:18.29]That's accurate.
[221:21.13]No uncut gems.
[221:23.87]That movie just came out, like, three months ago.
[221:33.71]I didn't see this.
[221:34.27]It was supposed to be kind of good.
[221:35.52]I didn't see it.
[221:38.50]Nothing comes close to Happy Gilmore.
[221:39.92]No.
[221:40.56]Nothing does.
[221:43.40]I would say the difference between this S tier and this A tier is probably... It's probably like 60 feet.
[221:50.64]Probably like 70 feet.
[222:00.54]Actually, that's... No.
[222:01.56]That's better.
[222:02.02]That's better.
[222:12.90]Zohan is beyond S tier.
[222:14.82]Alright, let's go back to Diablo II.
[222:28.71]Clear your tier list.
[222:30.87]Tier lists...
[222:33.50]Hotel is not F-tier.
[222:36.56]No, Hotel... Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[222:38.06]I didn't see that.
[222:38.94]Okay, I didn't see Hotel Transylvania.
[222:41.47]I got upset that it was the only animated one on here.
[222:44.65]I didn't see this.
[222:48.17]You want me to put pixels anywhere besides F?
[222:54.98]Alright, let's go. ...
[223:04.08]That was fun.
[223:06.28]Now I gotta pee.
[223:07.94]But let's take the first break.
[223:09.56]Be right back.
[227:33.12]Okay.
[227:33.30]They have returned.
[227:38.60]I'm back.
[227:42.26]What was the last thing we were doing in Diablo?
[227:57.96]I need to change the volume back to where it was.
[228:04.85]You can hear the game.
[228:05.69]Diablo tier list.
[228:10.04]Uh, what?
[228:16.88]Alright.
[228:19.40]I have the... I gotta go to Trevinsial.
[228:23.85]It's a little bit further up.
[228:28.07]I gotta go to... I didn't get the waypoint.
[228:30.83]I have to go up from the sewers.
[228:35.93]Yep.
[228:38.14]Any more chests?
[228:44.40]What's my favorite soap?
[228:46.46]Can you have a favorite soap?
[228:53.85]Yes, you can.
[228:56.59]Why?
[228:57.11]Why?
[229:00.72]I mean, I guess there's so many that... A favorite soap, like, brand or flavor?
[229:23.36]Alright, I need the TP here.
[229:28.70]Oh, the waypoint, whatever.
[229:31.86]My favorite soap is probably... I like Lush's shampoo.
[229:48.25]It's hard to find.
[229:59.17]I think my favorite action group is soap.
[230:11.70]I don't know.
[230:15.24]Whatever's on the rack at Walmart.
[230:20.57]Whatever I can just slime on my body and then shower it off.
[230:34.31]Irish Spring?
[230:34.93]I actually love Irish Spring, but Kim hates it.
[230:40.37]So anytime that I would want to use it, Kim is like, no, no, do not.
[230:50.48]I don't use it anymore.
[230:55.80]My weapon is broken.
[231:01.07]It's alright, I don't need to go back.
[231:05.24]It smells like chemicals.
[231:10.76]I mean, it does have sort of a chemical smell.
[231:22.26]It has a green chemical smell.
[231:23.98]Alright, I need to get the flail and preventive.
[231:28.02]I gotta move, actually.
[231:31.51]If I have this, might as well use it.
[231:35.83]Don't go that fast.
[231:36.59]Don't go that fast.
[231:37.25]Seriously, I don't have a weapon and I'm in hardcore.
[231:39.37]I forget that sometimes.
[231:42.01]No, I gotta... Everything's made out of chemicals.
[231:49.94]Yeah.
[231:51.34]Who repairs in Act 3?
[231:55.77]It's still Act 3.
[231:56.45]Yes, we're getting to the end of Act 3.
[231:59.27]We'll be at the end of Act 3 after I get the flail.
[232:02.39]We'll then be going to the Durance of Hate.
[232:05.59]And then be doing the most farmable thing in the game.
[232:11.71]It used to be Pinwheel.
[232:14.31]What's his name?
[232:16.14]They nerfed him because it was so easy.
[232:19.00]What was his name?
[232:19.60]What was his name?
[232:26.82]There's Pindle or something, right?
[232:31.58]Pindle skin, yeah.
[232:33.04]You used to be able to... So there was this little mini boss in Diablo II.
[232:38.26]His name was Pindle skin.
[232:41.10]He was right next to the waypoint.
[232:44.30]And you could kill him in one hit.
[232:46.09]And he dropped an amazing drop table.
[232:48.07]He had the same drop table as bosses.
[232:51.01]So you would just remake a game, kill him in one second, loot.
[232:53.59]Remake the game, kill him in one second, loot.
[232:55.09]Over and over again.
[232:55.71]Hundreds and hundreds of times.
[232:58.39]And then they nerfed it because it was way too easy to get anything.
[233:09.18]And then I think that they also nerfed Mephisto too, didn't they?
[233:13.34]Long time ago.
[233:24.88]They nerfed an easy-to-kill character.
[233:26.98]Well, they nerfed his loot table.
[233:28.58]They made it so he didn't drop as many good things.
[233:33.24]I mean, at some point, people are just making, in your Battle.net lobbies, a new game every five seconds.
[233:40.26]Or every, like, ten seconds.
[233:42.78]To kill the same enemy, and that's what every single person is doing that's logged in.
[233:47.15]At some point, you look at that and go, uh, this is kind of, that's probably dumb.
[233:50.65]We should probably do something about that.
[233:57.60]Do I eat McDonald's?
[233:58.58]It's like one of my favorite places.
[234:00.40]Yes.
[234:02.69]In fact, I may even eat McDonald's later.
[234:04.21]Because you just said that.
[234:06.41]And you influenced me, Influencer.
[234:12.83]How would I know?
[234:13.33]Didn't you get banned?
[234:14.99]Oh, what the fuck?
[234:16.83]What happened?
[234:20.36]That was weird.
[234:21.92]What just happened?
[234:27.57]huh yeah I lost chat too for like a second it was like one tenth of a second almost hit trevinsil yeah it was dead for a second
[234:54.20]This part is always such a pain in the ass, but having Necromancer with Summon is pretty great, actually.
[235:06.57]Do I like bath bombs?
[235:07.65]Yes, I do, but one time, probably two or three months ago, I did a bath bomb, and I thought I had Jaundice, and I freaked out and almost canceled the stream.
[235:22.46]I was seconds away from canceling.
[235:23.78]I think I actually did cancel the stream.
[235:25.22]I was like, guys, this is... I gotta do something.
[235:26.88]I gotta go.
[235:27.40]I have to go to, like, the doctor.
[235:29.96]And I did a mustard-colored bath bomb.
[235:34.62]And it stained my skin. ...
[235:52.69]Oh, yeah.
[235:54.52]Almost went to, yeah, we talked about it on stream.
[235:58.22]Because we talked about if I had gone to the doctor, how horrible would that have been?
[236:02.21]He would have been like, what's wrong?
[236:03.83]Yeah, I've got jaundice.
[236:05.57]I'm not sure.
[236:06.13]Because we were talking about it.
[236:07.35]I had like a liver scan.
[236:08.47]Because remember when all these medical things were going on?
[236:11.88]I had a liver scan.
[236:12.92]So I'm sitting there going, uh-oh.
[236:15.28]This is it.
[236:16.12]This is my liver, right?
[236:18.68]Imagine going to the doctor.
[236:20.84]And he takes a napkin and just kind of wipes your skin.
[236:37.33]uh the council can auto kill like you can automatically kill you have to be ready they sprint really fast and one of them has an insanely deadly move you've got to be ready you're a hypochondriac
[237:01.18]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[237:02.28]It would have been really, really weird.
[237:04.15]It would have been so hard to describe, too.
[237:05.43]It would have been like, oh, well, I have a liver scan coming up, and I thought I had jaundice, and... I... I don't... I should go?
[237:14.71]I'll... Thanks.
[237:18.59]Alright, we need to do a Turbansuit Waypoint.
[237:23.11]Usually pretty close.
[237:24.67]Usually.
[237:26.47]I'm going to use that turn pretty loosely because I am bad at this game.
[237:31.23]You're going to see lots of fails.
[237:34.59]You're going to see lots of triumph.
[237:45.14]The council might get him.
[237:49.08]No, I don't think so.
[237:50.22]If we come this far, I think it's going to be something to act for.
[237:55.42]That truly kills me.
[237:57.12]We've come so far.
[237:59.29]I'm not sure it's going to be Act 3 that does it.
[238:02.01]Act of the Ancients will get him.
[238:11.23]Yeah, because I can't leave that area.
[238:14.15]I don't know.
[238:14.53]It's going to be tricky.
[238:17.97]I would be happy if I completed all of Normal on Hardcore.
[238:21.41]Just because I've never done it before.
[238:26.53]Not that waypoint.
[238:28.23]Did I get it?
[238:29.07]Wait, I did get it, didn't I?
[238:29.90]It's right there.
[238:33.24]Any FTK news?
[238:34.24]Yes.
[238:35.78]Actually just had a meeting with the people that are making it.
[238:40.34]We are going to... It's still being developed!
[238:45.14]And it's going to be a lot more.
[238:48.16]We took all the feedback from everybody.
[238:52.12]It's going to be a lot more... It's not just going to be kind of random, like, hey, let's go, and if you kill me, you kill me.
[238:58.29]We're going to be doing lots of interesting things.
[239:02.85]So it's not just going to be a mess.
[239:07.39]They just actually started working at it again, like as of tomorrow, or like as of today.
[239:16.32]And it's going to bleed into...
[239:19.16]That server, after the next stream, we're going to do a couple of fun things on stream.
[239:26.68]And then that's going to turn into a 24-7 Minecraft server.
[239:32.18]At least for a little while.
[239:35.80]Just for you guys to play on, whoever wants to participate in that community.
[239:41.64]And I'm scared of doing this.
[239:47.94]I cannot promise that that server will be available forever.
[239:51.94]But I can tell you that it will be available at least for... I would assume a majority of 2020.
[239:57.38]Alright, here we go.
[240:00.52]This is the bad... Ah!
[240:02.65]These kill.
[240:03.03]Alright, where are they?
[240:04.49]Where are they?
[240:04.89]The Hydra's the worst.
[240:06.27]I forgot about the Hydra's.
[240:08.35]Alright, we gotta bait out some of the council members.
[240:13.65]Alright, stay back, stay back, stay back.
[240:15.49]Where's my... Give me my... Give me this.
[240:21.38]I'm not going in yet.
[240:22.02]I need to get a mage.
[240:28.73]Did he explode?
[240:32.47]Where is it?
[240:33.35]Where's his body?
[240:33.89]Alright, come on.
[240:49.11]Alright.
[240:50.03]Here they come.
[240:51.35]Kill this stupid water thing.
[240:57.41]When they come out, they come out.
[240:58.47]They just... Okay, they're there.
[240:59.69]They're there.
[241:00.03]Okay, there's one.
[241:00.39]Who is that?
[241:01.41]Council member.
[241:01.91]Kill him.
[241:05.44]Good.
[241:07.12]One down.
[241:08.86]Another one.
[241:09.94]This is a good fall.
[241:11.64]Oh, fuck.
[241:23.07]Okay.
[241:24.15]Kill for a sec.
[241:25.31]Everybody alive still?
[241:28.05]Get the rest of them.
[241:31.15]Oh!
[241:33.60]Don't go in too hard.
[241:34.50]Don't go in too hard.
[241:35.04]Pull back if you have to.
[241:42.10]Oh, Gollum's dead.
[241:43.69]Gollum's dead.
[241:44.07]Is there anything on the ground?
[241:46.19]Oh, he's alive.
[241:46.55]He's alive.
[241:46.81]He's alive.
[241:54.22]Oh, Jesus.
[241:59.01]Alright, that's three down.
[242:02.13]I think that's seven?
[242:08.37]I'm going to get a new... Yeah, I'm going to get a new one.
[242:13.57]How's that not made out of metal?
[242:16.22]Alright, fresh.
[242:22.64]Back in.
[242:24.23]my favorite scent ah these things do so much damage you have no idea we got to pull another one out oh look at all that fire alright we got two we got two there he is flame ringer
[242:49.14]Come on, Vik.
[242:50.54]Look at Vik doing work.
[242:52.64]There's Kaleem's flail.
[242:54.86]He did it.
[242:56.56]Got it.
[242:58.92]Nothing from the council?
[242:59.70]I think there's one more in here.
[243:03.30]Holy fuck.
[243:03.84]Okay, there's another named one in there.
[243:10.91]Uh, my favorite smell?
[243:13.60]Some odd questions tonight.
[243:19.94]She was right in front of me.
[243:20.66]Alright, get in.
[243:23.56]We need to get in here.
[243:24.28]Somebody has to kill him.
[243:24.94]They're doing it.
[243:32.39]Is another one in here?
[243:38.57]How many more people are in here?
[243:41.04]an am rune it's not too rare but it's still pretty good who else is in here oh it's another one this on hell or night and nightmare temple's dark power is broken is horrendous alright I got the flail combine everything together
[244:12.55]Come back, break this, and then we're going to be almost at the third Act boss.
[244:15.05]Act 4 is actually very short.
[244:15.87]Favorite scent?
[244:16.47]Okay, this is going to sound weird.
[244:17.71]Uh, when you drive around the back of a Burger King.
[244:20.69]Okay.
[244:39.58]ridding kuros of the council of zakarum was essential that Burger King exhaust is what I'm gonna call it must be close to finding their brother mephisto by now you've no time to waste
[245:04.93]Counseling.
[245:06.71]Brains mute everything.
[245:07.67]Make Kaleem's will.
[245:09.11]Sorry, spoilers.
[245:10.73]That's what it's called.
[245:12.19]The eye, the brain, the heart, and the flail.
[245:15.70]Kaleem's will.
[245:19.36]You can only use the only thing that works to break the orb.
[245:27.74]We bring you to Mephisto.
[245:31.14]So, we are making our way to the Durance of Hate.
[245:37.92]Let's sell some shit.
[245:40.90]Diablo and Bael have surely found the temple city by now.
[245:45.56]They seek to free their brother, Mephisto, who was imprisoned by the Haradrim in the temple's guardian tower.
[245:51.43]My brothers will not die in vain.
[245:53.33]You must reach him before his brothers do and prevent them from releasing hatred upon the world.
[246:03.88]My brothers will not die in vain.
[246:12.77]one of my favorite lines bash the orb dude was that was that was that was that stuff speaking
[246:39.57]Can we get a Bugleberry emote?
[246:41.55]Uh, the idea is maybe to have like a 50 slot Bugleberry emote.
[246:50.81]Yeah, we're all out of here.
[246:51.81]Who's with me?
[246:53.43]Oh, me, me, me, me!
[246:55.29]Alright, let's go!
[246:59.89]Burrows of hate level 1.
[247:06.89]Search for Mephisto in the Burrows of hate.
[247:11.97]When we find two, I've got to find the, uh, uh, waypoint.
[247:21.60]And we can do Mephisto runs.
[247:23.88]Hopefully I don't get instantly killed accidentally somehow.
[247:27.48]Is he gonna kill Mephisto?
[247:46.89]Let's get lucky and have it just pop up right here.
[247:48.63]That'd be great.
[247:50.17]Burns of Fate, level 2.
[247:50.75]Come on.
[247:51.01]It's been a while since I've been in here.
[247:54.72]So, you know, these memories are coming back.
[247:59.32]Fisto runs for better gear.
[248:00.96]Yeah.
[248:01.32]Yeah.
[248:03.26]What was the orange thing?
[248:05.74]It was a rune.
[248:09.81]socket runes.
[248:12.21]Let's say you have a 3, 4, 5, or 6 socket piece of gear.
[248:15.97]There are words you can spell with the runes that make a unique item.
[248:20.76]Something that they did not have in Diablo 3.
[248:25.36]I don't really know why.
[248:27.68]Because people really liked it.
[248:29.52]People thought one of the best parts about this game was collecting runes and making rune words.
[248:33.86]I don't know why they got rid of it.
[248:36.65]And we got fucking lucky.
[248:42.99]Hey, Otto.
[248:44.29]What are you doing?
[248:49.92]Diablo Megalov 3.
[249:01.53]Yeah, I'm not a... I'm not a major, gigantic fan of Diablo 3.
[249:10.16]I did think Diablo 3 was fun to play.
[249:14.96]But I didn't think it was fun to continue to play.
[249:18.06]The original Diablo 3 was... Eh.
[249:32.69]It was good.
[249:33.41]It was okay.
[249:36.37]They had like the most uninspiring shitty item system.
[249:41.32]The abilities were fun to use.
[249:44.84]Combat was fun.
[249:46.78]Although it was sort of a little... It was a little... The word I'm going to use here is like nosebleeding.
[249:52.49]You know what I mean?
[249:53.79]I'm going to get that.
[249:57.19]It was just like, you just kind of sit back.
[249:59.17]And just, your nose is bleeding.
[250:03.21]While you just click the same button and just scan into a hallway.
[250:05.95]It's a thousandth time.
[250:08.99]Boring.
[250:15.20]You mean brained?
[250:16.96]Yeah, it's a little nosebleedy.
[250:21.80]Alright, be careful.
[250:30.01]I could die here.
[250:32.41]Fire.
[250:34.99]Just protect me at all costs.
[250:44.95]Losing people.
[250:45.63]The Iron Golem is still pretty good though.
[250:50.23]It's doing alright.
[250:50.83]There were like three enemies in all of Act 1.
[250:59.85]I'm an item person.
[251:02.47]I like collecting items.
[251:04.47]There was no reason to do that in Diablo 3.
[251:10.87]Every legendary was the same item.
[251:13.59]It just had hundreds of stats on it.
[251:20.49]That was it.
[251:21.27]And I know when Reaper of Souls came out, they improved that game a lot.
[251:26.27]But there's only so many band-aids you can put on something before you have to go to the hospital.
[251:32.36]One of the things I really didn't like about Diablo 3 was grinding for legendaries and then re-rolling stats.
[251:45.38]It added that RNG on top of RNG on top of RNG.
[251:50.26]It was just a madness.
[251:56.41]You had to roll, you had to get the item and see what it rolled.
[252:00.28]And then you had to re-roll something on that item to be better for what you wanted it for.
[252:04.92]And then after that roll, there was another roll to see what it rolled as.
[252:08.81]It was roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll.
[252:12.51]Did you get, what, did you get max?
[252:13.97]No, you didn't.
[252:14.53]It was a shitty roll on that roll.
[252:19.90]Oh, sorry.
[252:20.44]You were looking for a plus 15% to Fireball?
[252:23.92]You got 11%.
[252:24.64]I have to do it again?
[252:28.13]I just remember being like, what the fuck am I doing this for?
[252:55.51]Good thing you only have one point in summon resist.
[253:05.91]We're okay.
[253:06.41]This way.
[253:26.45]I also like putting points in too.
[253:28.81]I know that some of the argument against, okay, you have to, you could put 20 skill points in that, but it doesn't matter because if it just was based on your level anyways, you'd see it grow.
[253:39.03]You don't have to put it, but I like putting points in.
[253:41.83]It's fun for me.
[253:42.77]It's, it scratches an itch for me.
[253:47.83]Every single move you have in this game can have 20 skill points put into it by you.
[253:51.59]Something about it is, I like it.
[253:53.65]Well, here we go, but I need the waypoint.
[253:57.88]Am I gonna play Diablo 4?
[254:00.74]I don't know.
[254:01.42]Diablo 4 really does seem like they weren't really ready at all for it.
[254:07.24]They saw all the backlash that Diablo Immortal had, and they may have been developing it, but then they're just like, alright, dude, we gotta fucking do something.
[254:16.65]Because it's not even close.
[254:18.67]Like, hey, we're gonna announce Diablo 3.
[254:20.41]It's not even close.
[254:23.59]Maybe you'll see it eventually over the next three or four years.
[254:26.59]I don't even know.
[254:27.07]Who knows?
[254:27.39]It might not happen for five years.
[254:40.93]And it looked like Diablo 3 to me.
[254:43.39]It just looked like Diablo 3, but they put it on another engine, kind of.
[254:51.40]Let's put it this way, I don't have very much confidence that Diablo 4 will be a very good game.
[254:56.54]Now, would I like to be pleasantly surprised?
[254:58.76]Yes.
[255:05.63]But judging by the fact that in that first itemization preview, it was red light, green light.
[255:14.35]Attack, defense.
[255:17.26]And they're going back to why people didn't like Diablo 3 in the first place.
[255:24.20]And it was... I want to make dumb choices.
[255:28.78]I want to have... I want to be able to put 20 fucking points.
[255:31.36]I want to have like a bunch of crazy fixes.
[255:34.48]You know what I mean?
[255:39.65]I was thinking something I didn't like about Diablo 3 was everything was tied to weapon damage.
[255:44.63]Like, no, I don't want to just have it be like 800% weapon damage, 1200% weapon damage.
[255:52.84]375% weapon damage.
[255:55.54]It just made it too... It just... It's too samey.
[256:00.78]Not only that, when you make a character in Diablo 3, you don't have to make another one ever again.
[256:04.43]If you make a barbarian in Diablo 3, that's the only character... That's the only barbarian you're ever going to make.
[256:10.33]You can just be anything.
[256:10.95]You can just do anything.
[256:13.07]Am I ranting?
[256:13.59]Am I ranting right now?
[256:16.29]I feel like I am.
[256:16.90]I feel like I'm ranting.
[256:18.74]This is kind of ranty.
[256:32.49]But then you have to think back too, right?
[256:33.85]So this is also important.
[256:35.01]It's a very important part of this conversation.
[256:38.07]The people that made this game, none of them are even going to work on it.
[256:43.84]You know what I mean?
[256:44.88]This game was made by completely different fucking people.
[256:47.82]100% different dev team. 100%.
[256:56.91]So it's... Well, I really wish we'd get like a true sequel to Diablo II.
[257:01.19]The reason why we're never going to get a true Chrono Trigger sequel.
[257:05.42]They're never going to be together again.
[257:11.98]Where is this waypoint?
[257:17.44]it's like yeah but like dozens of three done did you know I was gonna say dozens of different companies and three employees but I corrected myself and then I freaked out I am overburdened that's kind of the nature of game development it's kind of a
[257:41.58]Kind of like a sad, annoying reality of the whole thing is a lot of times when a game comes out, there's a lot of just layoffs and changing and you go, alright, thanks for making that game.
[257:51.53]30 of you no longer work here and you're going to go to different companies and we'll never be on the same team again.
[257:58.42]Like all of Blizzard North was gone after Diablo II.
[258:02.44]Gone.
[258:04.30]I don't nobody knows really what happened or why like blizzard north did not exist anymore after this came out they were even working I think on a prototype for diablo 3 and then it was like no they're all gone there you go alright you're never gonna get that same it's like the series is not even the same series
[258:28.95]It'd be like if I made a YouTube video, right?
[258:31.75]Let's say like tomorrow I upload a YouTube video.
[258:34.45]And I'm like, okay, guys, here's my next video.
[258:38.38]It's been like four years since my latest YouTube video.
[258:42.66]Check it out.
[258:44.16]And it's another person.
[258:47.82]And they're going like, hey, man, what's up?
[258:49.48]It's Jerma985 here, and I'm playing Apex Legends.
[258:55.16]I'd be like, this is not even the same person.
[259:07.69]I didn't make that video.
[259:08.57]Is this even my video still?
[259:10.67]Is this even my channel still?
[259:11.87]That's where it gets weird.
[259:22.11]Because we're led to believe that all these things are sequels, but it's like it's not even the same people.
[259:36.06]And eventually, there it is.
[259:38.10]Because eventually I'll find this fucking waypoint.
[259:42.58]To Miss Piggy's shirt.
[259:44.06]So many potions.
[260:05.62]Alright, are you guys ready to take on Mephisto?
[260:08.82]And maybe die?
[260:09.54]Mm-hmm.
[260:11.04]86,000 gold.
[260:16.85]I should probably level up one more time before doing Mephisto.
[260:25.41]Anything that's not a greater healing potion is getting sold.
[260:33.92]And even some of the greater healing, just sell them.
[260:52.59]Once we get to Nightmare, you're going to realize that this was all not even worth doing.
[260:58.00]But it's okay.
[260:58.42]Alright, let's go.
[261:08.33]Did I redeem a wink?
[261:11.09]Nah, nah, save it.
[261:12.93]Trust me, save it.
[261:24.38]Nah, save it, save it, save it.
[261:25.92]Save it!
[261:26.69]You wanna save it.
[261:35.95]We have to fight another council, by the way.
[261:37.59]Which sucks.
[261:40.24]This one's arguably worse than the last one.
[261:43.88]Did you redeem it?
[261:44.34]No, you didn't.
[261:51.89]Don't be so right about Diablo, you make me mad.
[261:57.44]Kill Mephisto.
[262:02.60]What's my lightning resistance?
[262:04.06]Not very good.
[262:04.90]I have lots of cold, but no lightning.
[262:07.34]Lightning is so important here.
[262:12.86]Let's be careful.
[262:15.16]Here comes another council.
[262:16.11]They're going to start getting burnt.
[262:20.71]Kill at least one of them.
[262:21.43]Come on.
[262:27.83]Pull back, pull back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[262:32.43]I got no shame in this.
[262:38.03]Easy, easy, easy.
[262:40.63]Vic, don't do it, Vic.
[262:42.31]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[262:42.99]Okay.
[262:50.07]I gotta get the army back.
[262:55.08]Isn't lightning resist important?
[262:56.38]Yeah, it's important for everything.
[262:57.58]It's just hard to find sometimes.
[263:00.25]Oh, I need another item.
[263:01.43]Alright, Vic, let's go.
[263:06.67]He's gonna make an army.
[263:08.15]This is not even Mephisto either.
[263:09.81]This is gonna suck.
[263:11.39]Hopefully he drops it.
[263:13.65]The nerves are starting to come up because this might be the end.
[263:16.07]Could be the end.
[263:18.39]How does that know I'm coming?
[263:31.18]wink ray missed bits 5 000 from guess who guess who phylactery lich
[264:00.10]Fifty dollars.
[264:02.16]Fifty.
[264:02.76]Five zero.
[264:08.90]Back.
[264:09.46]Jeremiah, I appreciate how good you're doing, but understand that if you don't die like a failure, chat doesn't get to laugh at you.
[264:14.56]Wait, wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[264:21.93]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[264:24.75]There's more to this message I can't see.
[264:28.31]What does it say?
[264:30.50]It says, I appreciate how good you're doing, but understand that if you don't die like a failure, chat doesn't get to laugh at you.
[264:36.07]Consider our happiness.
[264:47.05]It's been considered.
[264:53.55]And I, of course, want you guys to be happy.
[264:58.15]Of course I do.
[265:01.25]I want to be happy too.
[265:03.31]Where are the bodies?
[265:07.75]Have I used every body?
[265:08.89]Where are the bodies?
[265:14.57]What the fuck?
[265:16.18]I can't do this alone.
[265:17.40]I need bodies.
[265:22.98]I reloaded the area.
[265:23.86]God damn it.
[265:33.97]Let the bodies... Let the bodies... You have to scream to do that.
[266:00.58]How is that possible?
[266:03.90]I talk normally for like two hours, my throat starts to hurt.
[266:07.90]Can you imagine screaming as loud as you possibly could for like two or three straight hours during a concert?
[266:23.61]One, nothing wrong with me.
[266:29.91]Two, nothing wrong with me.
[266:31.67]Four, nothing wrong with me.
[266:40.31]Oh, they're invisible.
[266:47.75]Something's got to give up.
[266:49.37]Something's got to give up.
[266:51.09]Something's got to give.
[266:52.15]That's an old song, too.
[267:01.93]Ow.

[267:46.35]Thanks for the fucking huge money, both of you.
[267:51.13]They say, Jerma, please stop making dial-up modem noises and watch the new Nancy Drew show.
[267:57.90]I'm going to be in the majority here that doesn't watch the Nancy Drew show.
[268:09.19]Wait, she got her own rock shell.
[268:21.88]No, it's... What network is it?
[268:23.78]I don't know.
[268:25.68]There's some network.
[268:28.04]Fuck.
[268:31.19]I need metal... I'm just gonna buy something in the store.
[268:34.49]Where'd it go?
[268:35.67]Grass plate.
[268:40.29]Lightning resist.
[268:41.05]Perfect.
[268:41.45]Let's move.
[268:45.07]Alright.
[268:45.61]Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out.
[268:47.89]I don't want to take a waypoint because the waypoint's already where I want it.
[268:50.07]You know, because something's got to give.
[268:53.21]Am I just going to walk in circles?
[269:02.24]Seriously.
[269:02.64]Might as well get another level while I'm just walking around aimlessly.
[269:10.54]Let's kill some stuff.
[269:13.96]If you could stream the show, would you watch it?
[269:16.32]Yes.
[269:17.90]I would.
[269:19.28]Just for the joke.
[269:21.20]For one day.
[269:23.70]Just for the joke.
[269:24.52]For one day.
[269:25.14]And then never again.
[269:32.86]Alright, come on.
[269:35.04]I gotta kill, like, three more things.
[269:40.91]We'll get it from the council.
[269:43.48]We got to gang up on somebody.
[269:56.84]Careful when we go in here.
[270:00.89]Kill it.
[270:01.15]Kill it.
[270:01.49]Kill it.
[270:01.79]Good.

[270:21.21]Just dropping bombs on us.
[270:30.78]Careful.
[270:39.09]Can you read the Nancy Drew novels?
[270:40.87]No.
[270:41.03]Are there any more council members?
[270:44.49]I know there's one.
[270:46.85]There's one over here.
[270:47.99]I gotta clear them both out because this is hardcore.
[270:49.53]I can't fuck around.

[272:25.39]This is a good place to do it.
[272:32.96]I've been saying aye aye aye a lot more.
[272:34.68]I never realized that.
[272:35.46]I'm not going to apologize for it though.
[272:38.47]It's a different fucking word.
[272:39.83]Alright, same thing on the other side.
[272:43.75]We have a good crew.
[272:44.51]Over here.
[272:50.19]Almost getting that fire.
[272:55.56]Alright, full team.
[273:06.72]No, it's not the same word.
[273:09.11]It's not the same word.
[273:10.41]And it's actually the premise of the video.
[273:14.59]It's the premise of the video.
[273:16.91]You're doing the premise of that video.
[273:18.53]Okay, I'm not going to get bored.
[273:19.83]Let's go.
[273:20.17]Come on, get in.
[273:39.41]I killed them both.
[273:40.87]Holy fuck, I thought I had my game blue.
[273:45.72]Nice.
[273:47.54]Okay.
[273:50.08]We are free to fight the Fisto without very much interference.
[273:55.86]He's still alive.
[273:59.70]What do you have for lightning resistance?
[274:02.64]Alright, you're gonna have to tank him.
[274:06.13]It's going to be up to you.
[274:07.73]You have better gear than I do.
[274:09.65]You have better stuff than me.
[274:13.89]Alright.
[274:21.12]Let's... Actually, I'll put a portal here.
[274:24.78]Let's get ready.
[274:26.72]Level up.
[274:28.82]Here's what you can choose from.
[274:35.85]Kill him for his stuff.
[274:45.12]I will not influence your vote.
[274:48.24]Here's what's available.
[274:52.18]You already know this.
[274:55.99]You already know what's available.
[275:01.03]Let's just get it off with.
[275:14.72]Like, no.
[275:15.98]Oh.
[275:16.08]Oh.
[275:44.25]It seems we're split here.
[275:47.07]I don't know what the new ones do.
[275:54.34]Well, the new ones on the bottom, you shouldn't be clicking because they can't be put in until level 30.
[276:10.66]Well, it's definitely not Summon Resist.
[276:13.64]So that means it has to be Iron Golem.
[276:15.12]Because I can't click the other one.
[276:19.12]Thank you for voting.
[276:32.50]Reset it?
[276:33.12]Wrong?
[276:34.00]What do you mean wrong?
[276:40.17]Clearly 16% of you clicked on the left side.
[276:56.39]Alright, I'm giving you one more chance here.
[277:05.77]Alright, you can't tell me that... I have to zoom into this.
[277:16.22]Ayayay, ayayay, there it is, ayayay.
[277:22.92]Hold on, hold on.
[277:39.28]Hold on.
[277:39.84]Hold on.
[278:06.55]there.
[278:07.77]Now it should be it should be real easy now.
[278:12.91]Do it again.
[278:38.66]Do I have to go in even further?
[278:43.04]This means most of you guys are clicking right here.
[278:46.55]Alright, if you're going to click on something, make sure you click like over here or over here.
[278:53.07]Don't click like in here.
[279:01.70]Zoom in more.
[279:08.22]there's no way to mess this up now there's no way to screw this up
[279:38.15]Now you've been doing it on purpose.
[279:39.11]Look at that.
[279:39.69]It's on purpose.
[279:40.88]Look at that circle.
[279:42.46]Look at that.
[279:48.34]There was no problem the whole time.
[279:50.00]I didn't have to zoom in the whole time.
[279:59.91]Ugh.
[280:02.51]It's iron, it's iron, that's iron golem.
[280:03.93]That's iron golem.
[280:04.97]He fucked around too much.
[280:05.97]That's 68% over, no, look at that, that's iron golem.
[280:15.36]Streamer's choice?
[280:18.80]No, that's iron golem.
[280:21.66]Unfortunately, that's really, that is iron golem.
[280:23.46]Look at this blob over here on the left side.
[280:26.83]Alright, let's go.
[280:36.43]Blame your fellow chatters.
[280:39.69]Or, you know, they're having a fun time messing around, kicking around.
[280:52.89]They're really just kicking around.
[280:54.85]Iron Golem.
[281:04.17]Take a look.
[281:07.61]So going from three to four will be another 15% damage returned and more plus 40% damage bonus.
[281:14.85]I mean defense.
[281:18.76]315 defense and a lot more thorns.
[281:28.54]See the stats now.

[282:21.22]That's Vitality.
[282:23.68]Vitality, thank you.
[282:24.94]Thanks for voting.
[282:25.44]Appreciate it.
[282:35.57]Yes, it was.
[282:37.56]Nice.
[282:38.32]Cool.
[282:39.14]Alright, let's go.
[282:40.72]Let's go attack Mephisto.
[282:47.63]Actually, let me sell.
[282:53.09]Holy shit.
[282:56.44]God damn, man.
[282:59.50]Freddy just gave $400 in bits.
[283:08.08]That's 40,000 bits from Freddie Dredd.
[283:12.54]That is oh mega bits.
[283:17.43]Yes, Freddie today has given $600 worth of bits.
[283:19.29]That's a lot of winks.
[283:28.24]Uh, they say, I went to Nobu tonight.
[283:31.02]It was amazing.
[283:32.02]Going to Hash House tomorrow night, though.
[283:34.52]Getting the blue cheeseburger, and I'm telling you, telling them you sent me.
[283:37.99]I hope I get kicked out.
[283:44.59]I hope you don't get kicked out.
[283:45.67]Because I don't want to tarnish my rock-solid reputation in Hash House at GoGo.
[283:51.17]Nobody knows.
[283:51.63]I've never told anybody.
[283:55.26]I didn't tell anybody.
[283:59.86]I just go and I eat the food and I like it and I leave.
[284:03.76]But holy shit, Freddy.
[284:05.10]Have fun in Vegas, man.
[284:08.12]Thank you so much for the 600 bucks tonight.
[284:17.58]Ash House Ogogo in the link.
[284:18.88]Make sure you go to the one in the link.
[284:27.39]Hold on.
[284:27.93]I need to read this.
[284:29.93]I'm sorry, Jeremy, but I can no longer watch the stream.
[284:32.83]It's not you.
[284:33.45]You were poggers.
[284:34.99]It's me.
[284:35.63]I'm an omega lul.
[284:37.47]I'm sorry if this is Pepe hands, but it has to be done.
[284:40.67]We've been weird champ for months and it's time to end it.
[284:46.60]Thanks.
[284:48.04]Good luck.
[284:48.58]Good luck to you.
[284:50.24]But Freddy, have fun in Vegas.
[284:54.17]If you want my favorite spots in Vegas, at least on the Strip, because I think that's going to kind of be where you are.
[285:00.69]The Aria and the Cosmo are the two best casinos on the Strip, without a doubt.
[285:04.82]They're just probably the nicest ones.
[285:07.82]The Aria, probably especially, is probably the nicest casino on the Strip.
[285:14.10]Circus Circus is, I mean, the place I do like, there's a Circus Circus for different reasons.
[285:28.12]Another 80 bucks from Freddie.
[285:31.26]Freddie dropping stacks tonight.
[285:36.90]At almost $700.
[285:37.40]Love you big time, Jerma.
[285:41.40]Thank you for the suggestion.
[285:42.38]I'm going to go on the link.
[285:47.26]I'm going to go to the link.
[285:50.06]High roller.
[285:50.94]High roller, Freddie Dredd.
[285:55.12]I'd play the Betty White machine.

[287:21.27]I don't have anything that can do it though and you can't unsocket.
[287:35.97]What about you?
[287:36.43]Do you have any armor I can buy?

[290:56.01]Quick!
[290:58.15]Alright, keep it up.
[291:02.03]I'm ready with the heal.

[291:25.54]Don't.
[291:27.19]Don't hit me.
[291:27.67]Don't hit me.
[291:29.77]Oh, no.

[291:36.01]Vic.
[291:36.23]Help.
[291:37.59]Vic.
[291:42.13]Get out of there.
[291:42.81]Get out of there.
[291:43.31]Get out of there.
[291:43.93]Alright.
[291:44.13]We're fine.
[291:44.41]We're fine.
[291:46.07]I need...
[291:50.42]Quick, quick, I gotta hurry up and get, before he starts regenerating health, I need, let's go, lower QR, let's go.
[291:57.90]I need to regroup.
[292:00.98]I'm not gonna fight him.
[292:01.74]I don't have, my gear sucks.
[292:04.41]I don't have any offensive abilities.
[292:07.29]My offensive abilities is other people's offensive abilities.
[292:16.47]Quick, before he recharges.
[292:20.92]Come on, somebody.
[292:21.96]I need to fight somebody.
[292:23.02]Anybody, please, before he regens.
[292:30.02]Vic, you were supposed to take that.
[292:34.91]You wiped the whole raid.
[292:35.87]Alright, get in.
[292:40.27]Vic, I don't like your attitude very much.
[292:48.42]Uh-oh, guild's breaking up.
[292:56.14]Oh, fuck.
[292:56.50]Okay, get in.
[292:57.10]Anything metal on the ground?
[293:03.14]Battleaxe.
[293:04.48]Let's go.
[293:05.00]I had to move.
[293:27.15]Bring the crew back in.
[293:32.03]Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[293:33.71]Docs.
[293:34.59]Alright.
[293:36.79]Go!
[293:39.54]Swarm him.
[293:43.96]I can replace.
[293:44.40]He's gonna die.
[293:52.55]Kill him!
[293:53.79]Kill him!
[293:57.59]Go live minions!
[294:00.81]Act 3 is done!
[294:03.15]Ooh!
[294:06.02]Oh, that's a lot of cool looking things that I don't know if are gonna be worth it.
[294:12.24]I think I already own this- this is- this is- I already have this breastplate.
[294:14.96]Eyes and hearts.
[294:17.08]107 to 105.
[294:17.56]It's the same fucking thing.
[294:26.50]But, we can turn him into a, uh... It's still so stolen.
[294:31.26]Make him into a golem.
[294:32.60]Alright, I got some more stuff to look at, though.
[294:35.15]Elm.
[294:36.79]41 to health.
[294:40.61]Filactory, thanks for the $50.
[294:41.89]Hey, it's me, Mephisto.
[294:45.09]Where the fuck did you go?
[294:45.95]I have an appointment after you.
[294:47.09]Come clean up these skeletons.
[294:48.68]I didn't read it in time.
[294:51.76]Watch the lore video?
[294:52.66]Alright, we will watch the cutscene on this one, I promise.
[294:54.56]Um, is that better than what you have?
[294:57.05]No, you have berserkers.
[294:59.53]33, 33.
[294:59.99]Fire resist.
[295:06.02]That's better.
[295:06.88]Alright, what else we got?
[295:16.23]Our faith in you was well deserved.
[295:19.07]But Diablo has made his way to hell, and it is likely that Bael followed him there.
[295:23.95]Diablo.
[295:25.09]Enter the infernal gate, and kill the Lord of Terror before all is lost.
[295:31.34]Come with me.
[295:33.10]Will our world be saved?
[295:42.81]Hello.
[295:46.69]I just said, in Spanish.
[295:51.11]Diablo, your day is... Your day has come.
[295:55.43]Diablo, your day has come.
[295:56.67]Alright, I can make these both into, uh... Iron Golems.
[296:12.52]Let's do the Breastplate.
[296:36.69]Now we're in Act 4.
[296:37.37]It's gonna be fucking Omega.
[296:41.93]I'm so excited for... How do we vote Vic off the island?
[296:49.34]Vic was an integral part of what just happened.
[296:57.52]Yeah, I'll check the other loot, too, and there's more stuff to drop.
[297:03.58]Battlestaff, Power Shield, Broadsword, Battlestaff.
[297:08.41]Bring it back to King.
[297:10.71]What do we got?
[297:15.19]Plus 3 to Glacial Spike.
[297:16.57]Can the Iron Golem cast Glacial Spike?
[297:18.75]Is that how you do this?
[297:19.61]A lot of lightning damage.
[297:28.23]All resistances plus 11.
[297:34.45]I wish I could store these.
[297:35.81]Alright, it's time to get rid of the gems.
[297:38.79]It was fun while it lasted, but these are all going to be worthless soon.
[297:42.91]Sell the chip gems.
[297:46.13]Yes.
[297:47.91]This shit's not metal.
[297:50.95]That's right.
[298:00.48]In Act 4, they're going to start dropping at least flawed and regular.
[298:22.19]Okay.
[298:26.65]Okay.
[298:27.09]Okay.
[298:28.49]Quest completed.
[298:29.99]Something else on the ground.
[298:32.99]Broadsword.
[298:33.47]Could this be better than what I have?
[298:38.21]Not even close.
[298:40.79]What are the gems for?
[298:46.67]Sockets.
[298:49.15]You can socket...
[298:51.12]Lots of gear has sockets.
[298:53.67]They're good just to, you know, fill up.
[299:00.31]What's a socket?
[299:01.35]This.
[299:02.67]See, sockets too.
[299:03.75]Some gear just has empty spots.
[299:06.27]And you can put whatever you want in them.
[299:14.51]We also didn't do quest four, but we don't have to do that.
[299:17.61]You get a book of skill, which you can use to upgrade your stats once.
[299:22.35]We're almost at level 30.
[299:24.09]Not necessary.
[299:24.75]Time to go to Act 4.
[299:29.89]There we go.
[299:34.69]There's also some shit back here.
[299:36.01]This chest to open.
[299:41.38]All the way in the back.
[299:44.40]Why you always carry keys because some of these chest backs here that you see locked is why you should have a key every time you do this.
[299:51.64]It could be something good in there.
[299:54.50]Could.
[299:55.74]Very possible.
[300:00.14]Greater.
[300:00.88]Greater.
[300:03.84]Alright, that's it.
[300:07.09]Pretty cool.
[300:09.07]Hey, I love these chill laid back streams lately.
[300:13.00]yeah it's good to take a little bit of a just hang out and play a game that you like happens sometimes I like it too alright so you're talking about sockets this has two sockets and it's not worth it unless you have a two rune word I need a key how do I not have a key it's locked how do I not have a key
[300:41.10]Portal.
[300:41.74]You wanna watch the cutscene?
[300:42.42]The cutscene's gonna be loud.
[300:43.56]Alright, here's the cutscene.
[300:46.85]Quiet.
[300:59.91]I did as you told me, Tyrael.
[301:03.06]I found the temple of the Zakarum.
[301:06.68]In the deepest recesses of the temple...
[301:10.03]I found a dark gathering.
[301:13.31]My companion, the Wanderer.
[301:16.75]Tal Rasha.
[301:18.87]And a great evil who can only be the lord of hatred himself.
[301:27.06]Mephisto.
[301:29.30]I heard a voice that, like a thousand needles in my heart,
[301:37.54]My brothers, at long last we stand reunited.
[301:41.35]The infernality has been prepared.
[301:42.79]The time of our final victory is at hand.
[301:44.71]Let the way to hell be open.
[301:49.82]And the evil that was once vanquished shall rise anew.
[302:01.34]Wrapped in the guise of man shall he walk amongst the innocent, and terror shall consume they that dwell upon the Earth.
[302:18.59]The skies shall rain fire, and the seas will become as blood.
[302:25.70]The righteous shall fall before the wicked, and all creation shall tremble before the burning standards of Hell.
[302:37.54]But I saw then who's not meant for mortal eyes.
[302:43.50]The gate stands ready.
[302:56.25]Brother, the time has come to assume your true form.
[303:07.66]Arise, Diablo.
[303:22.69]What choice did I have?
[303:25.55]I ran.
[303:27.49]You are the harbinger of our return, Diablo.
[303:45.34]Send forth your terror into Hell.
[304:11.18]Oh, he doesn't do that there well the next cutscene coming up is the best one Good to see you
[304:23.40]We've made it to Hell.
[304:26.54]You get a lot of good shit from this.
[304:29.20]Mysterial.
[304:52.33]It is good to see you again, hero.
[304:54.45]It is good to see you again, hero.
[304:56.09]I know every line.
[304:56.93]Mephisto's defeat is a great victory for the Light.
[305:00.38]I knew that you would eventually find your way here.
[305:04.00]The Pandemonium Fortress is the last bastion of Heaven's power before the gates of the Burning Hells.
[305:11.07]This place has been hallowed by the blood of thousands of champions of the light, many of whom were mortal like yourself.
[305:18.70]Now, the final battle against the prime evils draws near, and you must face it alone.
[305:26.38]I have been forbidden to aid you directly.
[305:28.56]Well, it's actually going to be my friends that do it.
[305:31.55]You and I both are in the same boat here.
[305:33.03]We just watch.
[305:33.65]Your triumph.
[305:37.23]You're really talking to skeleton number 240.
[305:39.20]Not me.
[305:39.48]You, skeleton 240.
[305:40.00]It is up to you.
[305:54.70]And Vic, you were there as well.
[306:01.13]And this skeleton's just like, just brainless.
[306:07.78]Skeleton 240.
[306:09.54]Lies to you, and he just like turns and goes like... ...and give up Heaven's most guarded secrets.
[306:16.98]He became a corrupt shadow of his former self.
[306:20.68]Iswal Chatville is literally never going to kill Diablo Gonna be tricky Yeah, it'll be hard It's gonna be really hard
[306:45.12]Diablo is going to do his AoE flame wave and kill every single companion.
[306:54.19]And then I'm going to run around going and then open up a portal and run away and do it again.
[307:00.19]That'll happen probably 20 times.
[307:14.23]You're Mella.
[307:15.05]Yeah, Mella.
[307:18.89]How come we don't... Where's the intro?
[307:21.19]Don't they have intros?
[307:22.05]Alright, I got money to gamble.
[307:34.38]Well, we don't need cold in hell.
[307:36.97]We need fire resistant hell.
[307:45.73]What do I have for fire right now?
[307:46.85]Zero.
[307:47.05]Alright.
[307:49.77]There are only three quests in Act 4.
[307:52.42]Pretty self-explanatory.
[307:54.10]Go kill Diablo.
[308:11.65]Alright, let's move.
[308:13.33]I just need to get out there.
[308:14.44]Remember, he's a set piece right now, so I don't want him to die.
[308:18.66]I am going to gamble, though.
[308:19.56]Let's do, like, a weapon or something.
[308:21.66]Anything.
[308:21.94]Because, right, I mean, this is not... I'm in hell.
[308:25.32]This is not going to do anything.
[308:26.99]To half the people.
[308:29.01]Make a rune word.
[308:30.19]Well, alright.
[308:30.77]What do we got?
[308:31.83]What's the wiki?
[308:32.29]I'm just going to look it up, right?
[308:34.35]Like, I don't know these by heart.
[308:41.94]Let me take a look.
[308:44.24]Diablo II Rune Words.
[308:48.84]That's cheating.
[308:50.58]How is it not?
[308:52.50]How does the Epic Games Store come up when you type in Diablo II Rune Words?
[308:58.41]That makes no sense.
[308:59.29]Alright, Rune Words.
[309:09.92]We need, okay, three socket shield, no.
[309:16.62]Scepter, weapon, three socket sword.
[309:20.18]We can make this.
[309:22.60]King's Grace, three socket sword or scepter.
[309:25.99]Is Amn, Ral, and Thul.
[309:27.91]I don't have Thul yet, though, but that's a lot.
[309:30.45]That's a lot of cool shit.
[309:39.41]There's also Leaf.
[309:40.83]Two Sockets.
[309:41.85]Dave.
[309:43.99]Two Socket Helm is Orton Soul.
[309:45.87]Those are kind of rare.
[309:51.41]Two Socket Helm.
[309:52.49]Neph and Tear.
[309:56.44]Rhyme is Shale and F. But Shale is actually not easy to find.
[310:00.96]I don't have Shale.
[310:02.80]It's pretty good.
[310:05.81]What about Stealth?
[310:07.33]Yeah, Talon F. Two socket body armor.
[310:12.53]That's good, but let's Poison Resist, though.
[310:18.06]Dexterity and Poison Resist, and then a bunch of running and fast.
[310:20.98]You run, like, really fast.
[310:23.64]That's not for me.
[310:29.80]Tier and L. Wouldn't be bad.
[310:34.61]Amn and tear.
[310:36.41]It's called strength.
[310:42.22]Alright, well, first of all, I need to get something that has a socket in it.
[310:46.64]Two socket wand, dull and low.
[310:49.48]I don't have those.
[310:54.17]Did you remember any advice?
[310:55.01]Yeah, I would probably...
[311:01.36]I would probably try to tell your teacher something else besides your username.
[311:09.39]That usually doesn't work.
[311:14.49]What about these new ones?
[311:24.16]No.
[311:24.72]No, it's going to have to be one of the original ones.
[311:26.16]At least for now.
[311:28.97]Alright, let's try to find a two socket.
[311:32.83]Two sockets!
[311:34.59]No.
[311:35.31]Holy shit.
[311:39.01]These are so bad.
[311:40.37]Sockets.
[311:57.44]Don't buy low-level garbage.
[312:03.62]Well, I need something.
[312:06.92]I could go kill... I could go kill Legandario again.
[312:11.18]Needs to be white for rune words?
[312:14.73]Well, it has to be gray.
[312:15.95]That sucks.
[312:28.83]Alright, let's just take a walk outside.
[312:30.07]I'm proud to just have anything drop.
[312:33.27]We're in Act 5.

[312:55.23]He's a green.
[312:56.35]He's a set item.
[313:03.43]Holy shit.
[313:04.13]Alright, get in there, Vic.
[313:06.11]Make it happen.
[313:12.52]I made a set item into a golem.
[313:16.92]Yeah, I did.
[313:20.40]Now we got skeletons now.
[313:21.50]Keep going.
[313:24.69]Then I would do it again, too.
[313:35.29]Press plate.
[313:35.85]Alright.
[313:36.61]Two sockets.
[313:38.65]Two sockets.

[313:41.43]Alright, come back.
[313:55.14]So, this is to make... What should I make?
[313:57.42]Should I make stealth?
[314:03.20]Let's see.
[314:03.64]Let me just check it one more time.
[314:07.31]So, two sockets.
[314:12.41]Two socket body armor.
[314:14.77]What does it make?
[314:17.49]I could do smoke, but I don't have a lum, which is rare.
[314:20.99]Alright, TAL and F. F?
[314:28.25]Do I have TAL?
[314:32.13]No, I don't have TAL.
[314:33.93]Shit, I don't have TAL!
[314:37.45]No!
[314:43.95]You have an Uno.
[314:45.19]I need Tal.
[314:48.72]Tal is not rare.
[314:52.20]And that will make this.
[314:56.22]Plus 6 to Dexterity.
[314:57.52]Plus 15 Max Stamina.
[314:58.18]30% Poison Resist.
[315:01.78]Regenerate 15% mana, 25% faster run, 25% faster hit recovery.
[315:09.85]Do a Countess run?
[315:10.67]Damn it.
[315:21.10]That was like opening a present.
[315:22.26]Holy shit.
[315:22.80]Okay, Tal F. Here we go.
[315:31.59]Ow.

[316:00.95]25% faster run.
[316:04.76]Very cool.
[316:05.92]Alright.
[316:06.90]Now, what about a weapon?
[316:10.10]We're looking for a two or three socket weapon?
[316:18.59]Three socket weapon is Venom, but I don't have it.
[316:20.99]I think that's the easiest thing I can make.
[316:29.64]If I find if, I'm going to do malice.
[316:34.38]I need if lf for amd ral fo.
[316:41.90]Do I have amd ral fo?
[316:45.97]I have amd.
[316:49.93]Amd?
[316:50.11]Let's check.
[316:53.97]Amd ral.
[316:54.91]Didn't I have a ral somewhere?
[316:57.51]I got another ral, didn't I?
[317:00.68]They're all in here.
[317:04.44]Oh, alright.
[317:05.91]I'll try to get that.
[317:06.65]I need to get a three.
[317:07.93]So I have a three socket sword right here and I've fucked it.
[317:14.01]Well, I didn't know.
[317:14.83]I didn't know.
[317:15.80]We're all full and if I find, alright, Raul.

[317:54.86]He knows all the voice lines, but doesn't know how socketing works.
[317:57.04]Well, I didn't... I know how socketing works.
[317:59.14]I don't... I didn't memorize every rune word in Diablo II.
[318:02.26]Holy shit, it's gonna take a while.
[318:06.17]Okay, we're good.
[318:10.73]Military pick?
[318:13.29]Three?
[318:14.09]Two.
[318:14.59]Get out of here.
[318:16.85]Let me... Oh.
[318:29.85]You get two skill points for killing his wall, by the way.
[318:33.51]Very useful.
[318:34.31]Keep an eye out for socketed weapons.
[319:08.48]I do move so fast.
[319:12.14]Alright, this is where I get the first test here.
[319:22.51]Colm's gonna die.
[319:26.35]Where is he?
[319:26.67]Is he fighting by himself?
[319:29.61]Where is he?
[319:32.17]He's over here.
[319:32.65]But he's alive.
[319:33.33]He's alive.
[319:43.18]Okay.
[319:45.18]Where am I?
[320:01.35]I still have no fire resistance, which is so just not good.
[320:06.44]The one place I really need it is where we are standing right now.
[320:15.14]I'm taking bone wall off my bar.
[320:17.68]I don't even use the damage.
[320:39.34]In their helmet?
[320:43.26]No, one socket.
[320:49.51]Make an album of song covers.
[320:55.01]What?
[320:56.99]I'm not a singer.
[321:00.38]Bone walls are just to troll people in PvP lobbies.
[321:02.78]Let's see.
[321:13.47]Sort of accurate.
[321:18.89]This really is a big game.
[321:27.75]His weapon... He's just doing... What's he doing?
[321:31.27]53 to 99.
[321:32.09]And look at his resistances.
[321:34.33]They're all maxed out.
[321:36.21]Wait, do you have fire resistance on any of this shit?
[321:40.85]No, you just have it, because you're better than me.
[321:46.62]Oh, I'm also not sure why I keep casting Bone Shield, considering there's one point in it.
[322:06.55]You begged us for bone shield.
[322:08.27]I did beg you for bone shield and you only gave me one skill point.
[322:14.46]I can't even get two.
[322:15.54]Oh, stop crying.
[322:49.88]People are just getting fucking framed!
[322:52.64]Oh, it's good there.
[322:56.60]Oops.
[322:58.56]I just frapped my golem and killed him.
[323:04.38]There's champions in here this way.
[323:22.59]Nothing.
[323:22.87]A whole lot of nothing.
[323:25.21]I'm staying in front of that.
[323:42.54]His wall is pretty close after you go right down.
[323:45.66]Yeah, you go to Plains of Despair, it's the next level down, and he's usually just right there.
[323:50.18]3-2 skill points.
[323:51.10]We're gonna need to use him wisely.
[323:54.25]Ooh, a regular skull, nice.
[324:15.11]Yeah, it's at this point I need to start to really pay attention.
[324:21.86]We're going focus mode for a little bit.
[324:24.22]Until we get close.
[324:25.12]Still have everybody, right?
[324:34.56]Yeah.
[324:46.53]Thankfully I can hurt these guys because they're not fire resistant.
[324:49.05]Most of the people are here though.
[325:05.74]I am definitely going to do this though a couple of times.
[325:12.28]try to farm out some uh to try to farm out some munix three socket three socket hold on I can't look at this oh my god they have more than us they have more people than us
[325:50.92]I drank seven gallons of water today.
[325:52.54]I think I'm drowning.
[325:53.74]Three socket sword.
[325:58.90]That's what I need.
[325:59.44]It's a war sword.
[326:01.50]I just need Thull.
[326:09.81]Get rid of this.
[326:19.21]My rings are so bad, too.
[326:20.35]This one's okay.
[326:25.00]I'm not going to use this.
[326:26.34]I don't have... Okay.
[326:27.73]I need a thull, and then I can make a pretty decent weapon.
[326:50.15]Make a golem out of the extra armor.
[326:53.03]He already is.
[326:53.98]I need strength.
[326:58.42]Let's hold on to this until I can find a skull.
[327:21.32]Why don't you carry a cube and inventory?
[327:22.62]I don't like it.
[327:23.49]What the fuck is this shit in here?
[327:37.56]I'm using it for extra storage space.
[327:52.35]too much clicking.
[327:53.51]That's for losers.
[327:56.31]That's for losers.
[328:00.85]What's that sword?
[328:01.97]I'm holding it because I want, in case I find a certain rune, I'm going to make another runeword and use that weapon.
[328:12.69]Yep.
[328:22.07]I gotta clean up my bar too.
[328:27.64]Less F buttons.
[328:51.92]Always carry a key.
[328:54.46]Might come in handy.
[329:11.14]Pillfold party?
[329:11.98]Yep, pill party.
[329:16.22]Yikes.
[329:19.57]Zero fire, as this looks like.
[329:28.18]Ah!
[329:28.34]Don't stand in front of that.
[329:31.60]Ugh.
[329:43.04]Damn it.
[329:44.36]Rawl.
[329:45.80]Just a rawl.
[330:15.59]Where are my tier lists, funny man?
[330:17.47]Uh, after I beat Iz, well, we'll do one.
[330:30.90]I've been watching this for four hours and I still have no idea what's going on.
[330:34.74]Uh, it could be a little confusing.
[330:37.56]Just based on the fact that I'm running around with ten random people.
[330:53.55]This amplified damage has such a low radius that I have to cast it five times.
[331:02.99]It's like two yards.
[331:04.29]Found it.
[331:07.84]Alright.
[331:09.70]Alright, his wall.
[331:11.78]Give me those two skill points.
[331:19.73]Dude, imagine if he sneezed.
[331:24.05]Too weird.
[331:35.78]The Doom Knights, these guys suck too.
[331:38.89]Playing to despair.
[331:47.23]Chainmail, what do you got?
[331:57.97]Two, eh.
[331:59.66]Holy shit.
[332:01.72]I'm gonna need you guys to stay alive.
[332:12.10]Actually, my light, well, I'm talking about the sun.
[332:21.72]Actual wink.
[332:32.13]This shook me out of bed and made me wink into a camera.
[332:35.93]That's what that looked like.
[332:41.59]It was fake?
[332:47.61]I'm sure it was.
[333:01.46]ball of skull incoming what's the max lightning uh what's max resisted small charm gonna have 10 it's not a great roll if that's the case 10 right is it seven
[333:28.54]Everyone's still left?
[333:29.14]Good.
[333:30.06]Where is his vault?
[333:32.49]Give me runes.
[333:38.51]Back up.
[333:38.97]Giant sword.
[333:40.15]We've got enough sockets.
[334:04.95]Longsword?
[334:05.53]3 to 19?
[334:08.13]The other one was better.
[334:13.69]Resist cold and health.
[334:18.18]I don't think that's going to be too much of a problem.
[334:34.57]The other one's 71 strength.
[334:38.31]I mean, I have 58.
[334:39.21]It's not too far of a way to go.
[334:54.40]You're ignoring our weird pleas for attention.
[335:00.98]I'm not paying that much attention right now to chat.
[335:02.86]Yes, you're right.
[335:03.46]Trying not to die in hell.
[335:08.62]Sapphire?
[335:09.44]Sorry about that.
[335:18.37]Sorry about that.
[335:31.34]Superman a potion!
[335:35.44]Cool.
[335:36.38]Flawed Amethyst.
[335:41.80]How has nobody died?
[335:42.70]Why are my guys so much better now?
[335:45.50]I'm just not getting overwhelmed at this point.
[335:49.16]Chainmail.
[335:57.22]looking for the quest marker puff up go get him super macho man
[336:23.29]Did I beat that on stream?
[336:26.73]I played Punch Out on stream, didn't I?
[336:28.41]Didn't I beat the whole thing on stream?
[336:40.70]No, I did.
[336:41.76]I definitely did.
[336:53.05]That never happened?
[336:53.67]Maybe I just did it on my own.
[337:00.25]Yeah, I did it on my own.
[337:02.35]Now I remember.
[337:09.17]But you said you were, but you never did.
[337:11.57]I did it off stream, I think.
[337:15.37]Sorry about that.
[337:28.32]We got a lot of doctor clips.
[337:31.30]Been looking for it as well.
[337:39.61]What?
[337:41.17]What is with this weird head?
[337:49.51]Oh!
[337:50.27]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[337:54.10]Yes!
[337:55.26]Yeah, yeah.
[337:56.34]There it is.
[338:00.85]Alright, so this is going to make... Okay, should I hold it?
[338:05.74]Because War Sword is a pretty good one-hander, right?
[338:08.80]For normal?
[338:13.67]That's not a bad one-handed weapon.
[338:20.46]Hold it until I'm certain.
[338:23.14]So what this is going to do... This is going to make something called... By the way, it has to be a sword.
[338:29.62]It has to be a sword or a scepter.
[338:33.64]This is going to enhance the damage by 100%.
[338:35.44]So this would be 16 to 40.
[338:40.22]Pretty great, considering.
[338:45.51]It will do an increased 100% damage to demons.
[338:47.79]50% more damage to undead.
[338:54.44]5 to 30 fire damage will be added.
[338:56.35]3 to 14 cold damage.
[338:59.71]152 attack rating.
[339:01.95]And then 100 more attack rating to undead and demons.
[339:06.31]And 7% life stolen per hit.
[339:09.51]It will not let me use it unless I have 71 strength.
[339:15.96]Dude, numbers.
[339:19.04]Alright, so this is, what is it?
[339:19.94]Let me make sure I get the right order.
[339:22.72]Amrothal.
[339:25.06]Am.
[339:25.94]Raul.
[339:29.22]Cool.
[339:29.86]King's Grace.
[339:31.20]Looking for another three socket one handed weapon.
[339:36.60]If it's better base damage, then I'm going to use it.
[339:43.28]I should just get rid of this fucking thing.
[339:51.19]I have another skull, don't I?
[339:52.03]Yeah.
[339:55.38]There we go.
[339:57.41]Lawless skull.
[340:04.21]I gotta organize a little bit because this is pissing me off.
[340:08.29]Oh, this is irritating me.
[340:17.44]This stuff is too big.
[340:31.48]I'm glad I found that.
[341:09.78]Move skull, please.
[341:11.23]What do you need?
[341:12.25]Do you sell?
[341:18.56]You do.
[341:19.32]Let's do that.
[341:20.28]I'm going to put this stuff back in here.
[341:24.02]Move skull, please.
[341:25.07]Move skull.
[341:25.65]Move skull.
[341:38.76]It does make a great sound.
[341:41.46]It does.
[341:41.76]Okay.
[341:48.64]Uh... Skull ASMR.
[341:52.34]Something like that.
[341:57.51]Nothing in here, right?
[342:00.19]Back to it.
[342:03.40]I'm going to pick up all the... Remember, it has to be a sword.
[342:06.72]It has to be a sword.
[342:15.29]Ooh!
[342:17.79]That's not bad.
[342:18.45]This one's terrible.
[342:19.43]Yeah, let's put this on.
[342:21.99]All resistances.
[342:24.11]Let's have some resistance.
[342:34.17]Eight resist all.
[342:36.23]Jesus.
[342:37.61]Where's he at?
[342:43.27]No, no, don't get too overwhelmed.
[342:49.56]Scale mail.
[342:51.20]Alright, actually don't get overwhelmed.
[342:53.12]I'm gonna get overwhelmed.
[342:53.96]I keep doing this shit.
[343:06.00]I can hit a sword, find a sapphire.
[343:08.59]If it was a giant sword maybe I would do it too.
[343:20.78]Alright, bought an invisible enemy.
[343:26.54]Found the next step, but I'm not doing that yet until I kill Ismael.
[343:39.84]More junk.
[343:41.62]More junk.
[343:43.82]Not even useful at all.
[343:45.88]Oh well.
[343:58.15]Golem's still alive.
[343:59.15]Yeah, it was a lot of defense.
[344:01.09]It was a pretty good item.
[344:05.23]For normal.
[344:12.03]I'm going to have to farm the pistol for a really amazing unique.
[344:17.84]And turn it into a golem so I can kill Diablo.
[344:23.27]You are looking into the future right now.
[344:25.73]There he is.
[344:48.68]Alright, let's go, gang.
[344:50.48]Get him.
[344:56.97]Taking 100% more damage.
[344:58.37]Alright, stop fighting this crap Zul, please.
[345:00.25]We need all eyes on him.
[345:06.72]We'll get him eventually.
[345:07.66]Don't worry.
[345:30.02]Let's do a tier list while they kill him.
[345:59.72]I was going to do it, but I can't.
[346:04.34]I just die in a second here.
[346:37.88]It was a fool to have trusted me.
[346:54.85]It was a fool to have trusted me.
[346:57.59]You see, it was I who told Diablo and his brothers about the soul stones and how to corrupt them.
[347:03.60]It was I who helped the prime evils mastermind their own exile to your world.
[347:09.09]The plan we set in motion so long ago cannot be stopped by any more agency.
[347:14.13]Hell itself is poised to spill forth into your world like a tight wave of blood and nightmares.
[347:20.98]You and all your kind are doomed.
[347:25.04]Why did you do it?
[347:27.94]Why did you do it?
[347:35.72]Izwaal was weak.
[347:37.46]He squandered his infernal power.
[347:44.55]Alright guys, this is important.
[347:49.93]Thank you, hero.
[347:50.65]It goes... Thank you, hero.
[347:53.73]Thank you, hero, for putting Izwaal's tortured spirit to rest.
[347:57.29]May the light protect you and the powers of heaven shine upon your path.
[348:02.52]Do I know why I know the first line of every single one of these?
[348:05.16]Because I've played this game hundreds of hundreds and hundreds of times.
[348:09.54]And most of the time the dialog goes like this.
[348:34.10]I don't know the rest of it.
[348:39.96]I just know the first line.
[348:44.33]And I've heard that first line from every character.
[348:49.09]Probably 2,000 times.
[348:49.79]Alright, this thing sucks.
[348:57.17]1 to 54.
[348:58.47]No.
[348:59.17]Junk.
[349:00.79]Two skill points, Bo.
[349:04.20]These skill points mean a lot to me.
[349:06.99]This is a big boy.
[349:14.62]26 to 54.
[349:17.48]Level 1 sacrifice.
[349:22.39]An actual melee move that I could use?
[349:29.06]Instead of just default shit left click.
[349:32.01]It's two handed.
[349:32.67]Never mind.
[349:34.29]I'll turn it into a golem.
[349:35.75]I don't have room to do that anymore.
[349:51.25]Alright, we have two points to spend.
[349:53.99]In fact, I'm going to hold off on this, because we're going to have three points to spend.
[349:58.43]So, we're going to do that first.
[350:00.49]I'm going to keep moving.
[350:05.25]Keep going.
[350:11.82]Where was that?
[350:12.64]It was down here, right?
[350:18.05]I found the other place to go, but I forget where it is.
[350:23.65]I don't know.
[350:24.93]Big map here in this picture?
[350:27.15]Well, actually, I know it's right down here, right?
[350:29.15]Down here?
[350:29.49]I think it's right here.
[350:32.56]I mean, I can run pretty damn fast, so... I'm not, like, in any real danger.
[350:42.24]Where the hell was it?
[350:46.23]Right there?
[350:46.53]Right there.
[350:53.71]Nope.
[350:54.65]Where the fuck was it?
[350:55.43]Big map.
[351:12.14]Where the fuck was it?
[351:20.09]Oh, these are champions.
[351:20.77]Alright.
[351:21.01]Don't fucking run.
[351:25.91]Oh, shit.
[351:26.77]Oh, shit.
[351:40.12]Oh, fuck.
[351:40.76]Fallen's dead.
[351:42.32]Fallen's dead.
[351:42.94]Run.
[351:44.42]Run, run, run, run.
[351:45.29]Not worth it.
[351:47.73]Wait.
[351:47.91]I got another one.
[351:55.02]Let's go.
[351:56.52]He's going to be strong.
[352:06.15]He's got a ton of damage.
[352:10.77]Let him work.
[352:11.29]Let them work.
[352:12.61]Jesus.
[352:34.73]Okay, we're good.
[352:35.35]I don't have to leave.
[352:37.43]Where did... The little staircase that I ran by and I saw it and I'm like, oh, there it is.
[352:43.16]I've got to remember where that is.
[352:44.18]I don't remember where that is.
[352:47.16]All the way to the left, I think.
[352:51.95]Yeah, there it is.
[352:52.41]Okay, I know where it is now.
[352:54.85]Break the mini-map again, please.
[353:07.83]Over there Also good I'm gonna be getting to the forge which we get some decent stuff there and
[353:38.71]Once we do the forge, we get to break the stone, which allows us to get a bunch of gems and then maybe even a couple of runes.
[353:50.75]Big bits again from Freddy.
[353:58.44]Freddy just gave another $250.
[353:59.18]25,000 bits and they say
[354:11.32]Hey, my girlfriend at least just won $200 at the Aria.
[354:16.08]Hey, there you go.
[354:17.20]So I'm donating it to you.
[354:21.89]It's like I played.
[354:23.11]I didn't even have to play.
[354:24.47]I went to the slot machines already.
[354:29.13]It was mine anyways.
[354:32.55]Hey, viva Las Vegas.
[354:36.53]I put 50 in, 200 came out.
[354:44.38]That brings Freddie tonight up to $930 in bids.
[354:54.11]Influence.
[354:57.13]Influence.
[355:00.41]Freddie Dredd, everybody.
[355:03.51]Hope you're having a good time.
[355:06.59]Don't lose it all, though.
[355:08.00]Don't go crazy.
[355:10.62]Vegas is fun, but don't let it consume you.
[355:15.85]But holy shit, that's a lot of money.
[355:18.23]Freddy, once again, thank you so much for dumping almost a thousand dollars in bits on this stream.
[355:30.37]I'm glad you're having a good time.
[355:33.79]Now, hey, now go play roulette.
[355:36.97]What?
[355:37.85]Hey.
[355:39.58]Run. 21.
[355:46.67]Put a $5 bill.
[355:48.44]Put a $5 chip on 21.
[355:49.78]And then put $10 on 00.
[355:55.28]Come back.
[355:58.27]We'll see the results.
[356:01.17]Gambling by proxy.
[356:02.99]And then just let me know how it went.
[356:04.21]Let me know how it went after you do that.
[356:12.15]And then if you could, if you could for me, there's a machine.
[356:15.33]There's a machine in there.
[356:16.37]It's called, it's called, it's called Lightning Link.
[356:20.27]It's great.
[356:21.49]What you're trying to do is you're trying to collect these hearts.
[356:23.83]Now just, now just videotape yourself doing that and how interested in it.
[356:38.41]Ah, there's a unique in here.
[356:39.87]I'm a unique enemy.
[356:42.41]Alright, we have three levels up to do.
[356:50.85]Let's do it.
[356:54.10]You have three skill points.
[356:56.74]Not level 30.
[356:58.14]We have one more level.
[356:59.04]You cannot do Fire Golem yet.
[357:00.58]I'm going to do this one at a time.
[357:12.37]These will be probably the last three skill points that you put in until Diablo.
[357:18.83]So... Fucking hell, whatever.
[357:29.69]Choose wisely.
[357:34.59]You okay?
[357:35.61]I'll be alright.
[357:38.47]Don't mind me.
[357:40.53]Where's the first skill point going?
[357:49.93]iron column again.
[357:50.83]Five points in iron column.
[358:04.52]I'm going to give us another five seconds.
[358:16.31]Okay.
[358:21.16]I'm doing it is that one?
[358:30.16]Where's point number two going?
[358:50.78]No, don't do fucking teeth this late.
[358:59.41]Am I actually going to put a second point into teeth?
[359:02.94]Am I actually going to do that?
[359:04.78]You can't be serious.
[359:09.90]These are so important and you're throwing it into the trash.
[359:34.47]There's still votes coming in.
[359:35.87]Hey, what do you mean no influence?
[359:43.77]Yes, two points in teeth would be fantastic right now.
[359:47.45]Late game into hell.
[359:51.10]Well, instead of two to four damage, we'll do three to five.
[360:01.56]Okay, another point in Iron Golem.
[360:11.56]You just guilt tripped everybody.
[360:12.99]Point number three.
[360:22.20]Where's point number three going to go?
[360:46.21]Stop clicking on fire golem.
[360:48.03]It's not going to do anything.
[360:49.35]I can't do it.
[361:12.75]Okay.
[361:14.91]Okay.
[361:17.29]It's actually fucking teeth.
[361:29.59]Two points in teeth.
[361:31.45]What a fucking... What a joke.
[361:34.11]What a joke.
[361:35.75]Two wasted points in teeth.
[361:40.78]Literally ruined the fucking run.
[361:46.06]How is it teeth?
[361:46.86]Because there's 28% here, like 31% here, and like 15% down here.
[362:27.11]That's 37%.
[362:27.33]63% split three times is 21% each.
[362:28.53]Blame the people that are still clicking Fire Golem.
[362:30.67]Where are the stats going?
[363:19.60]That's my fault?
[363:23.04]It had 41% versus 34%.
[363:25.33]Just rewind it, you'll see.
[363:32.85]You want to do a revote?
[363:35.31]You want to do a revote?
[363:36.05]I just want you to see.
[363:39.61]It's too late.
[363:40.60]It's too late.
[363:41.22]No, it's too late.
[363:42.74]I have to put it in teeth.
[363:45.16]But I want to show you.
[363:48.99]Alright, it's going in strength.
[363:52.21]We know for a fact.
[363:53.09]It's all going in strength.
[364:00.63]Alright, two points going to Iron Golem.
[364:05.28]Because that's what you voted for.
[364:12.62]One, two.
[364:15.09]And then the third point.
[364:17.73]Rewind.
[364:30.69]There you go.
[364:32.60]Streamer Rewind for the throne.
[364:34.43]Streamer Rewind.
[365:16.78]Teeth is absorbing us.
[365:28.49]There you go.
[365:30.32]31.
[365:30.34]30.
[365:30.50]Alright, we did it again.
[365:31.48]It's 31% on the left side.
[365:34.30]Done.
[365:38.52]I have to put it in fucking teeth.
[365:41.41]Blame everybody here for doing that.
[365:48.43]I can't believe I'm fucking with... Bone wall synergy, yeah.
[366:18.25]Yep.
[366:19.32]That extra percentage.
[366:21.48]That 15% of 3.
[366:24.06]I can't wait to do an extra .4 damage.
[366:29.98]Chew Crew reporting in.
[366:33.38]Hey, welcome everybody.
[366:34.69]Welcome everybody from the Chew Crew.
[366:37.83]Good to have you here.
[366:50.11]Oh, fuck off, chew crew.
[366:53.13]God.
[366:54.27]I didn't say that.
[366:59.73]Do I have any more floods?
[367:05.64]Come on!
[367:07.52]Come on!
[367:11.66]Nope.
[367:11.90]Alright, let's go.
[367:25.54]At least we have two more points in Iron Golem.
[367:30.37]That's pretty pog.
[367:31.83]Pretty PogChamp, you know?
[367:36.13]City of the Damned.
[367:37.23]We can make down one more flight of stairs.
[367:40.85]And that will bring us to the end of the game.
[367:45.67]Sort of.
[367:46.53]Kind of.
[367:49.81]Do I say pog in real life?
[367:56.64]I mean, I say, can't wait to get fucking McDonald's.
[368:01.03]In real life.
[368:02.99]Say that.
[368:03.39]Use teeth.
[368:40.99]It's so bad.
[368:46.87]It's so bad.
[368:56.28]Just wasting mana.
[368:57.66]That was fun.
[368:59.88]War sword.
[369:02.30]Ooh, pretty good war sword.
[369:04.98]He's a golem guy.
[369:15.35]You know what the funniest part about what just happened is?
[369:17.67]This is the most humorous part for me.
[369:21.66]It took you guys until Act 4 to start to ruin the game.
[369:35.91]That's... I'm actually sort of impressed.
[369:39.17]You waited for me to get truly invested in the game, and then you're gonna rip the rug underneath me.
[369:56.25]I know what some of you are thinking.
[369:57.15]You're thinking, oh, he's doing pretty well.
[369:59.87]I thought he was going to make a pass like that too.
[370:02.33]Oh, we're going to change that and make it so he can't win.
[370:11.55]I still will.
[370:16.61]That is what I think.
[370:18.09]Oh, I know.
[370:20.47]All of them goons will never do that to you.
[370:25.11]Golem goons.
[370:32.64]We're getting to a situation where there are... Are these Naruto houses?
[370:40.66]Golem goons.
[370:41.52]The Shu crew.
[370:42.60]The Drew crew.
[370:44.28]The Skelly crew.
[370:53.09]Not houses, like villages, right?
[370:55.29]There's like the leaf through, the fire through.
[370:58.57]What is it?
[371:11.04]The Golem Village.
[371:15.16]The Mega Milk Crew.
[371:24.05]You guys are fucked.
[371:26.62]What's my order for a McDonald's?
[371:28.54]First person that says it gets it.
[371:30.24]Well, they don't get it.
[371:30.82]I get to eat it, but you get to choose it.
[371:34.12]I want only numbers.
[371:35.44]Number one, number two, number three.
[371:36.80]Which one?
[371:37.43]Number what?
[371:39.33]Number three?
[371:39.87]What's a number three?
[371:41.17]What's a number three for McDonald's?
[371:42.43]I don't even know what it is.
[371:50.60]That better not be any, like, gross salad shaker or something.
[372:02.82]That's a double quarter pound?
[372:04.30]Three is a double double cheeseburger.
[372:06.34]Wouldn't that just be a quadruple cheeseburger?
[372:19.85]That's a number three.
[372:27.69]Siri, what's a number three from McDonald's?
[372:33.44]His password is...
[372:51.51]How am I going to find it?
[372:53.21]Not using tea.
[372:54.35]No, because it does 7,000% less damage than me hitting somebody with a stick.
[373:04.76]It's a noisemaker.
[373:08.47]Do Bugleberry eat a McChicken?
[373:10.45]Sure.
[373:11.33]Oh, oh.
[373:13.81]Oh, delicious.
[373:14.79]Done.
[373:27.66]And there's me doing an impression of Googleberry.
[373:31.22]I can't Googleberry.
[373:32.08]He's a real person.
[373:33.49]Not me.
[373:39.99]You guys have just moved one space to the right and given me even one more point in bone armor.
[373:45.67]No.
[373:46.61]Too cruel.
[373:52.48]Gonna be right here.
[373:53.04]Watch.
[374:12.73]It's just false.
[374:13.25]Did you give Yugobari a background check?
[374:16.49]Of course I did.
[374:41.25]I've been arrested seven times.
[374:42.45]Come on, I want to find the bottom here.
[375:15.50]No, I gotta run this way.
[375:17.04]Okay, I'm good.
[375:19.14]I'm good.
[375:20.28]That was almost really bad.
[375:21.52]River of Flame.
[375:22.16]Found it.
[375:22.56]And we got a waypoint.
[375:25.06]Just go in and... Alright, we're almost to the endgame.
[375:36.53]Another 5,000 bits.
[375:39.95]You are just... pile-driving money onto this ring.
[375:45.93]Yeah, normal is not the endgame.
[375:47.41]I'm just saying the endgame of Act 5, 4.
[375:49.68]Uh, phylactery.
[375:53.92]$50.
[375:57.27]Says, Vic walks like he has a load in his diapers.
[376:14.59]Thanks for the 5,000 bits, man.
[376:19.87]Appreciate it.
[376:20.55]Thank you.
[376:22.23]Thank you for the fucking hundreds of dollars.
[376:34.40]Pick for First Noble.
[376:36.78]Yep.
[376:39.32]When's the tier list?
[376:41.24]Right now.
[376:57.42]Okay, this is called, uh... 2000's Childhood Snacks Tier List.
[377:12.73]So, what we got is... Fruit Roll-Ups.
[377:16.99]Pretty good.
[377:17.47]Pop-Tarts.
[377:18.31]Depends on which ones.
[377:19.65]Let me get them out here.
[377:20.33]I don't know what this is.
[377:22.36]Oh, one of those.
[377:22.94]That's Trix yogurt.
[377:24.10]Mm-hmm.
[377:26.12]Bagel Bites.
[377:27.74]Might be S tier.
[377:28.46]It's possible.
[377:30.50]Yogurts.
[377:31.76]I'd rather have a Trix Yogurt.
[377:39.33]Are Dunkaroos on here?
[377:43.37]Dunkaroos are not on here.
[377:44.65]So this is an invalid test.
[377:48.23]There's no Dunkaroos on here.
[377:50.37]So I refuse to take this.
[377:59.02]Dunkaroos, fucker you.
[378:05.35]I'll take it though, just a snack pack pudding.
[378:09.31]Gross.
[378:11.21]Not gross, but like these things are pretty good.
[378:14.67]But is this a snack or is it a drink?
[378:17.70]Lunchables were awesome.
[378:21.14]That's a Lunchables pizza that belongs down in Neft here.
[378:26.52]These are the smushed up brownies where if you roll them up, they look like dog shits.
[378:29.96]They were okay.
[378:33.66]Goshers, S tier.
[378:35.98]No.
[378:36.88]No, they're not.
[378:44.84]What are these?
[378:45.74]Vitamins?
[378:48.72]Circus Animals.
[378:51.57]I don't even know what these are.
[378:53.49]Cereal straws?
[378:54.33]Those sound actually pretty good.
[378:55.27]They're going up here.
[378:56.67]Kid Cuisine.
[378:57.47]Disgusting.
[378:59.31]Although, I remember... No, I like the brownie.
[379:01.71]See?
[379:06.15]These are not the right ones, but these were amazing.
[379:14.18]Animals?
[379:15.58]Hold on.
[379:17.92]I don't know what these are.
[379:19.04]These are just Oreos.
[379:24.13]Smuckers un... Oh, these are the gross pies.
[379:27.80]Okay.
[379:31.06]Sandwich creams?
[379:32.14]Grandma's sandwich creams.
[379:35.14]These are fucked up.
[379:37.40]Group by the foot.
[379:38.04]Isn't there already on here?
[379:38.88]Alright, hold on.
[379:39.90]Let me get this right.
[379:40.53]These are the gas station pies, right?
[379:48.21]Those are the gas station pies?
[379:49.45]Yes.
[379:56.06]no well where are the gas station pies why they're not on here

[381:02.16]No, wait.
[381:08.80]This list, I don't like this list.
[381:19.43]Gushers kind of suck now.
[381:20.95]The brownies don't even, no.
[381:21.89]Get the Oreos up here.
[381:22.75]Go, put that up here.
[381:23.97]Gushers, go down here.
[381:24.77]Fruit by the Foot comes up here.
[381:30.03]I'd rather have a snack bag than a Lunchable.
[381:31.31]I'd rather have Danimals than a Lunchable.
[381:33.55]Well, those ones.
[381:34.23]Wait, I can't even see what these are.
[381:37.10]Oh, of course.
[381:37.78]This is wrong.
[381:38.32]This is the ones with... It's just like the weird mystery meat that you stack.
[381:46.56]Pizza's disgusting, though.
[381:56.99]Are these the little drinkable yogurts?
[382:04.52]Yes, okay.
[382:05.52]I belong up here.
[382:15.55]I'm not a pudding guy.
[382:17.01]I'm not a pudding person.
[382:27.68]I kind of want this.
[382:28.32]Do they have this at McDonald's?
[382:34.39]Hey, can I get a, uh, kid cuisine?
[382:38.63]Uh, I'm done.
[382:39.11]That's it.
[382:41.79]Now I am.
[382:43.49]Now I am.
[382:48.03]Top Diablo II stream.
[382:49.23]We're looking at kids' food.
[382:52.51]Whatever.
[382:52.81]Alright, let's do one more.
[382:54.53]How about, um... Chewing gum.
[383:01.95]Big League Chew S tier.
[383:09.93]Juicy Fruit, also S tier.
[383:17.31]Trident.
[383:20.87]Big Red.
[383:22.19]Dogshit.
[383:27.89]It just tastes like burning acid.
[383:30.25]It just does not... It tastes... It's awful.
[383:32.35]It's just... How is it?
[383:36.95]Wism... Bubble Tape.
[383:40.58]There it is.
[383:41.16]I thought for a second I was like, why is it not saying bubble tape on it?
[383:46.40]I'm only doing this because Juicy Fruit only lasts like 8 seconds.
[383:49.60]But it's the best tasting gum.
[384:00.00]Why is this on here?
[384:06.41]Oh, you know, I think Nicorette gum belongs in S tier.
[384:14.99]This is nicotine gum.
[384:19.71]Doublemint.
[384:22.33]Orbitz.
[384:23.29]Too basic.
[384:31.10]The double bubble jug.
[384:40.11]Plus, they try too hard with their commercials.
[384:44.78]Gum doesn't clean your mouth.
[384:47.58]People are like, oh, it's like brushing your fucking teeth.
[384:49.44]It's not.
[384:55.87]It's like xylitol, right?
[384:57.59]Whatever the sugar is.
[385:13.00]winter fresh I don't like the peppermint kind of gums I don't know what these are I don't know what this is error breath I don't know what these are and then this is just gumballs gumballs are pretty good actually can you do a how it feels to chew five gum impression yeah sure how it feels to chew five gum
[385:51.02]I think that's accurate.
[385:52.00]Wait, now it is.
[385:55.70]I'm not a big mint gum person.
[386:01.02]Very cool.
[386:01.68]Here it is.
[386:06.92]Big League Chew is the best.
[386:07.90]Double tape, juicy fruit, double bubble.
[386:11.12]Gumballs from the Gumball Machine.
[386:12.31]5G gum.
[386:15.49]And then the rest of this, we're pretending that we clean your teeth and please stop smoking cigarettes.
[386:24.62]I already got that one.
[386:25.42]This one here.
[386:27.98]This is who would win in a... Who would win in a fight?
[386:34.19]Who would mascot combat prowess?
[386:43.21]They're all cartoon characters.
[386:45.17]They can't... What do you mean wrong one?
[386:58.33]Well, he's already dead.
[387:01.33]So he doesn't make it.
[387:04.25]He's already dead.
[387:10.00]Sonny's cuckoo.
[387:12.94]You always gotta watch out the guy that's willing to do whatever.
[387:20.10]You just stomp on this.
[387:24.62]And it would just insta-die.
[387:26.00]Alright.
[387:32.95]It would just be a big tire mark footprint on this.
[387:36.13]Same thing with this fucking glove.
[387:38.35]Okay, let's get all the glove-based... They're done.
[387:45.38]You just rip them in half.
[387:52.22]Same with this.
[387:54.08]You're just a piece of cereal.
[387:56.47]You're gonna get stepped on in the fight.
[387:58.97]This is the sun.
[388:01.64]I don't know who else compares to that.
[388:07.30]This is a baby.
[388:09.94]I think the baby would actually be able to take on the gloves because the gloves can't do anything.
[388:19.95]Alright, now let's do humans.
[388:23.51]Just humans, okay?
[388:25.78]The king's supposed to be a human.
[388:28.44]Chef Boyardee's a human.
[388:31.65]Is that... Alright, this is a human?
[388:34.89]Oh, that's not a human.
[388:36.19]That's not a human.
[388:38.90]I thought it was... I don't know why I thought that... Okay.
[388:41.70]We... We didn't get... Is a dog could be classified as a human?
[388:46.02]We need real... Alright, this is a human?
[388:54.87]This is a human?
[388:55.69]This is a human in a costume?
[389:03.42]small human also small human green huge green human okay okay also human human except this this one has a gun right this is supposed to be like a revolutionary guy
[389:37.76]He doesn't have, like, a musket?
[389:39.76]He doesn't have, like... This guy has a musket, right?
[389:41.62]Alright.
[389:47.76]Ronald McDonald's a human.
[389:50.86]All humans have to be on the same tier, because there's no... Wendy's a human.
[389:58.42]This is also a human.
[389:59.18]This is a furry, right?
[390:00.12]That's a human.
[390:01.26]That's an anthropomorphic human.
[390:05.80]Uh...
[390:07.77]No, that's... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[390:08.97]I just saw the pants and shit.
[390:12.13]This is also a dog.
[390:13.09]Okay, dog.
[390:16.95]Cookie.
[390:19.51]Okay, baby eats cookie.
[390:22.97]Cookie stains gloves.
[390:26.03]Yep.
[390:38.14]That's Julius Caesar.
[390:39.22]I don't know who this is, but it looks like a person.
[390:50.87]Is it a person?
[390:52.47]I think that's a human.
[390:56.07]Count Dracula is a fucking creep, but he's a human.
[391:02.60]And he's like Dracula's cousin, so he goes over here.
[391:13.99]Alright, now it's animals.
[391:17.15]No, no, no.
[391:18.59]Humans.
[391:21.43]Dog.
[391:23.61]Bigger dog obviously goes in front.
[391:28.03]This is a cheetah.
[391:31.45]So, he's deadly.
[391:33.12]Alright, now we've got... Pillsbury Doughboy would just get rolled over.
[391:40.88]Someone would step on him.
[391:47.18]These guys are supposed to be little, right?
[391:53.16]This is a bee.
[391:55.36]But a bee would just be able to get hit and knocked out by any human.
[392:02.36]Polar bear.
[392:06.30]Kuna.
[392:07.40]Hold on.
[392:07.88]We're just going to get this right.
[392:08.98]Frog would be down here.
[392:10.88]This is like a wolf or something.
[392:14.54]Alright.
[392:15.38]Frog versus baby.
[392:17.66]Would a baby accidentally kill a frog?
[392:20.08]Right?
[392:20.32]If there was like a fight going on.
[392:21.44]The baby would just like... And like roll over and the frog would... Yeah.
[392:35.84]Alright, fragile but made out of glass.
[392:37.72]So it's got to go higher.
[392:38.56]This is... Yeah.
[392:42.22]This would take... This would take somebody with him.
[392:47.52]Yes, he's fragile.
[392:48.20]He's made out of glass.
[392:48.94]This is a big glass pitcher.
[392:52.20]All the Quaker Oats guy has to do is use the butt of his rifle and shatter him.
[393:00.23]It's fragile.
[393:00.87]He's made out of glass.
[393:07.57]He breaks through walls.
[393:10.24]He literally runs through walls.
[393:18.40]It's just an owl.
[393:20.91]Little dog eats owl.
[393:22.23]No, actually, owls are vicious.
[393:23.99]This is just a rabbit.
[393:31.63]This would be a tough fight.
[393:34.17]A chihuahua versus a bunny rabbit would be, that would, I don't know.
[393:48.21]No, I don't know.
[393:54.65]Chihuahuas, don't chihuahuas just kind of go like this?
[394:12.57]What is this?
[394:21.84]Captain Crunch is canonically microscopic.
[394:23.90]Well, let's let me just this is a big one.
[394:25.42]Let me get over this first.
[394:28.42]What is this?
[394:28.94]What is that an animal?
[394:29.74]It's a dinosaur.
[394:32.30]I don't recognize a dinosaur.
[394:33.58]Alright, it goes up here.
[394:36.08]The bear.
[394:36.56]Another rabbit.
[394:53.85]They're both even doing the same move.
[394:59.08]The Trix rabbit's a predator.
[395:08.56]Okay.
[395:09.48]Okay, hold on.
[395:12.00]I think the Nesquik bunny would beat the shit out of the Trix rabbit.
[395:20.44]They both do the same moves, though.
[395:22.06]It's hard.
[395:22.96]They both do, like, when the Nesquik rabbit sucks up the Nesquik, his ears go in a circle around.
[395:30.30]And then when he eats the Trix, it goes and they wrap it.
[395:33.96]They both do the same move.
[395:34.84]They both move set.
[395:35.56]It's a mirror match.
[395:38.72]That's too tricky.
[395:39.20]I don't know.
[395:47.37]This is a rooster?
[395:49.95]I don't know, probably down here somewhere.
[395:51.29]This is just a regular dog.
[395:53.49]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[395:54.75]Okay.
[395:56.61]Keebler elf would get stung by the bee and it would spear him through his chest.
[396:03.10]So he would die.
[396:03.74]It would spear him directly through his heart.
[396:07.10]Same with these three.
[396:14.44]And a baby.
[396:15.28]Okay, the baby's leveling up.
[396:23.61]The baby might accidentally eat the bee, though.
[396:26.65]Okay.
[396:31.20]Are these guys tiny, right?
[396:32.76]They're like this big.
[396:39.16]Yeah.
[396:40.58]Yeah, bee also kills these three.
[396:49.33]This is a stork.
[396:50.41]The birds...
[396:53.99]over here m m's alright uh Tony the Tiger tiger versus cheetah now that's tricky this is just okay this is an apple there's an apple and a cinnamon stick
[397:23.21]At least the glove can grab and squish and crush.
[397:27.97]Yeah, what am I thinking?
[397:35.16]Yeah, the hamburger helper could wrap around his neck and just start squeezing.
[397:40.06]Alright, same here.
[397:40.90]This would be tough, though, because he has teeth.
[397:50.59]I think they lose to the frog, though.
[398:03.01]Frog destroys him.
[398:04.43]But also, he's made out of polyester.
[398:09.99]The green giant is 55 feet tall.
[398:12.11]We'll get to it.
[398:13.27]We're going to get to it.
[398:20.00]I don't know.
[398:20.40]Eat more chicken.
[398:21.36]Is this supposed to be just a cow?
[398:22.48]It's a cow, right?
[398:30.68]And these are just M&M's.
[398:34.80]But they're kind of big, though.
[398:36.23]They're bigger than the rabbits and bigger than the chihuahuas.
[398:48.27]They're not human size.
[398:49.55]They're like this big.
[398:50.71]They're like two or three feet tall.
[398:56.09]Alright, let's think about this.
[398:57.67]Nothing can compete with the sun.
[399:00.05]This is a dinosaur.
[399:03.32]Alright.
[399:05.87]Green giant, you said he's 55 feet tall.
[399:10.77]That's just pure size.
[399:12.65]No one can compare.
[399:20.51]Oh shit, sorry.
[399:23.87]Yeah, nobody can compare.
[399:26.07]If you're 55 feet tall, the dinosaur would be tricky.
[399:34.87]This is like a friendly, happy dinosaur.
[399:36.81]This is not like a T-Rex, right?
[399:41.85]But this is also the jolly green giant.
[399:44.12]I don't know.
[399:44.96]They're the same.
[399:46.00]Remember, the dinosaur is the size of a macaroni noodle.
[399:57.52]Oh, it's the craft dinosaur.
[400:00.12]Alright.
[400:13.01]These two actually can't do anything.
[400:15.57]They just sit there.
[400:16.49]They can't even move.
[400:19.26]You guys are all the way down here with the shit that is inanimate.
[400:26.28]This would be a hard fight.
[400:32.80]Please, Caesar has a massive army at his disposal.
[400:36.46]Not in 2020!
[400:45.49]Well, if we're going by that, then these two are dead.
[400:48.71]Then these two are dead.
[400:52.46]This is... No, no, no, no, no.
[401:00.24]Oh, by the way, this is Little Caesar.
[401:06.39]He's like a foot tall.
[401:07.87]I forgot.
[401:12.29]He does have a weapon, though.
[401:15.41]Little Caesar is like a foot tall and he has a weapon.
[401:22.36]He might not... The stork might beat him.
[401:30.02]I'm not sure Little Caesar can go up against Doug.
[401:34.58]Or the bigger birds.
[401:47.96]Alright, hold on.
[401:51.44]Let's get this right.
[401:54.11]You don't belong up here.
[401:55.83]Although, you do crash through buildings.
[401:58.19]You, like, break through, like, building walls and shit.
[402:01.77]Nobody else does that.
[402:13.42]I think he actually might be stronger.
[402:25.80]Hmm.
[402:27.30]Tiger or cheetah?
[402:28.72]Probably tiger.
[402:31.24]Polar bear or cheetah?
[402:32.34]Polar bear.
[402:34.82]Sunny the cuckoo bird or cheetah?
[402:42.87]Tuna fish or cheetah?
[402:44.67]Bear?
[402:45.19]Bear.
[402:45.93]Wolf?
[402:46.27]Wolf.
[402:47.23]Owl?
[402:48.73]They're both fucked.
[402:50.57]I don't know.
[402:58.20]Tuna versus cheetah.
[402:59.54]Tuna.
[403:02.89]No, but okay, wait, but we, I don't, that's, I don't know.
[403:07.37]No.
[403:07.81]Tuna versus bear.
[403:10.25]Tuna's huge.
[403:11.53]They weigh like 2,000, they weigh like 3,000 pounds.
[403:17.99]If a tuna just swims really fast, it's like, it's like a Mack truck running into you.
[403:25.69]No, they're not.
[403:29.47]Well, it's a blue whale.
[403:30.35]Whatever.
[403:30.73]He's blue.
[403:31.67]Tuna's not fucking blue.
[403:32.55]I don't wear glasses either.
[403:39.71]Bear versus cheetah bear.
[403:41.79]Polar bear versus just regular bear.
[403:45.79]Is this a grizzly bear?
[403:46.49]What kind of bear is he?
[403:52.11]No, polar bear.
[403:54.24]Polar bear or tiger?
[403:55.44]Tiger.
[403:57.52]It's probably tiger.
[403:59.02]Tigers are huge and they're deadly.
[404:07.93]Tuna versus wolf.
[404:09.15]Alright, this is where it gets... I don't know if a wolf would kill a tuna.
[404:20.21]That had to be done.
[404:25.52]He's just too powerful.
[404:26.94]He has too many powers.
[404:35.63]Okay, this is... Let's get to the humans.
[404:39.27]Also two feet tall.
[404:42.98]And he's like two feet... No, no, he's not.
[404:44.54]He's just kind of a regular dude.
[404:48.66]Cow.
[404:50.74]I think most of these people could probably beat up a cow.
[404:53.98]In fact...
[404:58.27]He's super old.
[404:59.99]Yeah, he is old.
[405:01.63]I don't know what this guy is.
[405:03.26]What is this thing?
[405:03.86]It's not Wario.
[405:15.23]What is that?
[405:17.47]That's John Whataburger.
[405:23.45]Is he a superhero?
[405:24.59]Is he just a guy in a suit?
[405:25.55]I don't get it.
[405:25.95]What is he?
[405:37.05]He's a superhero.
[405:42.49]I'm not sure he, well... Superhero?
[405:48.12]But what are his powers?
[405:51.82]Eating a shitload of calories?
[405:52.94]Like, how are you a hamburger?
[405:55.52]How are you a hamburger superhero?
[405:57.82]Ronald McDonald is a hamburger character, but he's not a superhero.
[406:03.03]What does that even mean?
[406:16.94]He can fly and he has super strength.
[406:19.40]Do we know that, though?
[406:20.18]Or is this just a cosplay?
[406:29.75]Yes, it's canon.
[406:32.09]So then he has to be up here.
[406:36.06]If you're a superhero, then you're up here.
[406:39.08]If you can fly and super strength, obviously you're going to be next to the guy that can crash through walls.
[406:47.61]I still don't think he would win.
[406:50.05]Maybe he would, but I'm not going to give it to him.
[406:56.72]Alright, the king.
[406:57.38]It's just a guy.
[407:01.54]These are all just humans.
[407:04.86]Wendy.
[407:05.28]I think Ron- Okay, this guy's got a gun.
[407:13.16]So he's always up the top.
[407:14.58]In fact, he might be above the birds.
[407:25.00]Oh shit, he might actually be above Tony the Tiger.
[407:32.04]He's got his revolutionary musket.
[407:44.53]He would just shoot these people.
[407:48.13]What?
[407:54.05]Quaker.
[408:00.18]A member of the Religious Society of Friends.
[408:03.57]That's a real name?
[408:06.43]Religious Society of Friends.
[408:09.15]A Christian movement founded by George Fox devoted to peaceful principles.
[408:15.92]Central to the Quakers' belief is the doctrine of the inner light.
[408:25.58]They're pacifists.
[408:29.13]fucking pacifist well then you're gonna get you're gonna get bit to death by the apple good for you in this battle of all wits and skills
[408:56.34]The glove is gonna just like suffocate you.
[408:59.21]Whatever.
[409:00.69]The peanut would choke him.
[409:01.53]Peanut's dead.
[409:02.13]He died.
[409:03.61]He died today.
[409:04.59]He died this afternoon.
[409:24.90]The rest of this is just like, who got the first punt?
[409:27.58]I mean, this guy's all the way to the bottom.
[409:30.71]You know how hard it is to be in one of these suits?
[409:34.97]It's hard for Mickey Mouse to even lean down and give you a hug in this.
[409:43.22]He'd get mauled by the rooster.
[409:46.76]Maybe, uh... You'd lose to a dog.
[409:53.19]You would.
[410:02.57]He said Captain Crunch is like... No, he's not.
[410:05.01]There's like children in those commercials.
[410:09.68]This would be a fight.
[410:19.52]No, there's no way.
[410:20.97]He'll lose.
[410:21.35]He'll lose.
[410:22.19]No.
[410:36.06]can this is just another person in a costume why is Wendy so strong you if she pushed you just you push an old man down he's gonna die these are all old men and these people are two feet tall
[411:11.41]How big is a... What is a king to a god?
[411:15.33]A vampire can't die.
[411:20.96]I feel like this owl would just shred him up.
[411:28.20]He's just still a person.
[411:29.50]Wait, he can turn into a bat.
[411:39.53]Okay.
[411:40.97]That's fine.
[411:44.87]You're old.
[411:45.55]You're old.
[411:46.15]You're old.
[411:46.71]Ronald McDonald, though.
[411:47.73]How old is Wendy?
[411:57.92]Is Wendy supposed to be like 12 or like 15 or something?
[412:01.15]How old is Wendy?
[412:15.20]Just like 50.
[412:15.96]No, I mean like now.
[412:17.32]I don't know if he's going to throw haymakers.
[412:25.49]I don't know if he's fighting an owl though.
[412:37.36]I feel like you'd probably win, but you'd get fucked up.
[413:00.52]These are all the people that would lose to a vicious owl.
[413:04.56]I mean, if you were big enough.
[413:05.62]How big is Wendy?
[413:07.23]Is she like five, four feet tall?
[413:09.31]Alright.
[413:22.54]This is more accurate.
[413:24.34]The elderly would not.
[413:25.66]You think Chef Boyardee is going to get attacked by a fucking owl?
[413:30.78]These guys, they're toast.
[413:31.64]Okay.
[414:07.33]Colonel Sanders makes chicken for a living.
[414:08.93]He kills all birds.
[414:11.13]But if he were face to face with a giant bird, he's going to lose.
[414:18.70]He also walks around with a cane.
[414:27.80]If you think that a giant fucking bird is not going to beat Colonel Sanders,
[414:38.00]This is just going to can open his head.
[414:42.40]It's a hidden weapon cane.
[414:43.30]That's not part of any lore.
[414:44.79]That's not true.
[414:45.33]That's not part of any lore.
[415:03.28]I think this is legit.
[415:11.76]The dog might just... Okay, wait.
[415:13.57]The dog... We're leveling dog up.
[415:19.72]And cow.
[415:20.10]Cow.
[415:36.23]Little Caesar has a spear.
[415:37.41]Why is he so low?
[415:38.57]Because he's this big!
[415:42.59]He's this big!
[415:45.31]That spear is the equivalent of you getting stabbed from the end of a straw!
[416:00.42]And how much weight do you think he can put behind that spear?
[416:05.66]This guy weighs like 14 pounds.
[416:10.58]You think he's going to be able to skewer you with a spear this big?
[416:16.55]And he's 14 pounds.
[416:29.32]And he's eating.
[416:30.80]He's currently eating, always.
[416:33.68]And his eyes are closed.
[416:38.72]You're going to be scared of that guy?
[416:42.88]Everybody else here has their eyes open.
[416:46.71]He's the only one that's not prepared.
[416:50.39]Also the only one currently eating.
[417:10.49]Quaker has God to back him up.
[417:18.17]But he can open his eyes.
[417:19.44]He's eating a pizza.
[417:22.40]Every time you've ever seen Little Caesar, ever, he's been consuming a pizza.
[417:26.66]What, do you think he's going to lose that during a fight?
[417:29.56]No, that's his lore.
[417:30.90]That's what he does.
[417:32.88]He's going to be eating a pizza.
[417:38.63]Why is Quaker all the way... Quaker is a pacifist.
[417:42.78]I've got yelled at for this.
[417:49.98]Alright, he might be able to kill the rabbits.
[417:51.98]Alright, fine.
[418:00.17]Quaker has old man strength.
[418:01.75]Alright, he would accidentally fucking step on some of these things.
[418:07.11]Yeah.
[418:07.85]Okay, they can eat, right?
[418:09.21]Like, of course they can eat.
[418:11.01]He can eat cookies.
[418:12.09]He can eat bread.
[418:13.23]He can eat apples.
[418:14.50]Alright, he would eat.
[418:15.56]He can eat.
[418:16.80]He would eat these guys.
[418:19.56]Maybe he wouldn't know they were people and he ate them.
[418:22.54]I don't know.
[418:28.64]What about the glove?
[418:29.30]This glove can't do anything.
[418:30.06]It doesn't even have fingers.
[418:31.98]All this thing can do is scream.
[418:34.24]At least these other things have arms or legs.
[418:39.46]It's in a series of armless, legless faces that will just scream.
[418:46.13]They're all in a row.
[418:46.81]They're all on the same level.
[418:59.74]Oh, this thing might be punching and kicking and punching.
[419:05.20]But the glove kills him.
[419:08.28]A glove just wraps around his neck.
[419:16.62]Don't underestimate the Cinnamon Toast Crunch, guys.
[419:25.57]Yeah, that's true.
[419:27.41]Yeah, he can't do anything.
[419:30.67]They would just stick their fingers in his eyes over and over again.
[419:33.49]Until he passed out or something.
[419:35.13]I don't know.
[419:44.80]Still on Diablo II?
[419:45.68]Yeah, we're probably going to call it here in a little bit.
[419:56.51]Chuck E. Fried Chicken presents the kernel of Two Worlds Volume 1-1.
[420:00.53]Hey, Mr. Peanut's already dead.
[420:09.29]Please remember there's a literal baby above E tier.
[420:11.37]Okay.
[420:12.93]Now explain to me how a baby would not be able to defeat somebody that is an inch tall.
[420:25.44]Or a single bee.
[420:31.90]Or a frog.
[421:11.88]That's what the glove is going to be.
[421:14.30]Taco Bell dog.
[421:18.29]But yeah.
[421:22.99]But the Quaker guy... Here's the wall.
[421:26.17]This is the problem.
[421:27.43]The baby is the wall.
[421:29.41]Because anything below baby needs to be able to be killed or defeated by being rolled over accidentally.
[421:39.62]everything else on this list the quaker guy does not that doesn't fit that category alright quaker beats baby glove chokes quaker bunny rabbit eats glove done
[422:15.04]Glove would destroy it, wouldn't it?
[422:19.93]No, but it wouldn't, though.
[422:21.09]It wouldn't.
[422:21.65]No, it wouldn't.
[422:22.33]No, it wouldn't.
[422:22.81]No, it wouldn't.
[422:23.78]It wouldn't.
[422:24.56]This is a pacifist.
[422:52.03]No, I can't have that.
[422:54.65]Quakers used to hunt, so they have a gun.
[422:56.79]Thank you very much.
[423:00.34]So he goes back to where he was before.
[423:16.85]they don't shoot people but what's the alright so they hunt but they don't hunt there are pacifists but they they they shoot stuff they don't if chef boyardee's sprinting at the quaker in a full sprint with a hatchet in his hand is he going to shoot him is the answer no
[423:51.60]That would go against the ideology.
[424:04.14]The answer is no.
[424:12.87]And he's getting strangled by the glove.
[424:36.92]the quaker wouldn't kill the quaker wouldn't kill any the quaker oh he won't kill anything else he won't attack but he'll attack a baby like that's not accurate the baby uh
[425:13.03]Baby... Baby attacks Quaker.
[425:16.21]Yes, defeats Quaker.
[425:17.47]Glove... Defeats Baby.
[425:28.24]B... Yeah, a Quaker would like... Oops!
[425:36.30]How does Baby kill Quaker?
[425:37.68]Do you understand?
[425:41.58]This is a paradox.
[425:43.99]How does baby kill Quaker?
[425:45.35]How does Quaker kill baby?
[425:48.21]Paradox.
[425:56.25]He wouldn't fight so he would die.
[426:00.02]He wouldn't fight so he wouldn't kill.
[426:01.48]You understand the paradox here?
[426:18.41]He'd be outlived.
[426:20.67]Alright, that's fair.
[426:22.21]Alright, let's go.
[426:23.05]That's it.
[426:23.45]I'm done.
[426:30.91]Put Quaker in his own tier.
[426:33.36]No, he's just a guy.
[426:42.10]Baby starves to death.
[426:43.04]No, baby eats bee.
[426:44.36]Baby eats Keebler elf.
[426:47.71]No, no, this has nothing to do with eating people.
[426:49.54]This is fighting, right?
[426:50.74]This has nothing to do with eating anybody.
[426:53.00]Alright, that's it.
[426:54.80]Alright, no, no, we're done.
[426:59.13]There it is.
[427:00.49]There's your tier list for mascot combat prowess.
[427:19.34]Lower the tuna.
[427:23.34]No.
[427:26.68]You think a tuna, a huge ass tuna, is not going to be stronger than a person.
[427:33.52]If you are in the water with a fucking tuna, you're in trouble.
[427:39.38]What are you going to do?
[427:47.04]What do you mean Google?
[427:47.77]I know what a tuna is.
[427:48.95]I eat it all the time.
[428:25.67]Alright.
[428:31.91]Are they fishing or are they just fighting?
[428:41.52]And what's the arena?
[428:44.16]Is this Wendy home turf or is this Star Kissed Tuna Guy home turf?
[428:50.06]Because it's wildly different either way.
[428:54.02]Is this on land?
[428:55.96]He walks on land.
[428:57.02]How big is he?
[429:27.42]Average tuna length.
[429:35.32]15 feet fucking tall.
[429:37.75]Get out of here, guys.
[429:38.71]Give me a break.
[429:39.19]This guy's 15 feet tall.
[429:44.97]The average length of a tuna is 15 feet.
[429:49.74]He's huge.
[429:58.92]not an eel.
[429:59.84]That's the star-kissed tuna guy.
[430:04.06]He loses to a wolf.
[430:08.29]No, he doesn't.
[430:08.83]He's 15 feet tall.
[430:12.14]He doesn't lose a count.
[430:12.98]Count Dracula still kills him, though.
[430:14.30]No, he doesn't.
[430:27.93]Okay, that's good.
[430:28.75]I'm done.
[430:31.75]Let's go beat Diablo.
[430:42.64]He's small in the commercials.
[430:52.33]No, that's it.
[430:52.79]I'm good.
[430:53.27]That's the one.
[430:53.87]We're good.
[431:03.73]That was a good one.
[431:04.15]Alright, River of Flame.
[431:13.09]This is where the game is going to start to cross.
[431:19.31]Into the last part of Act 4.
[431:20.35]What the hell was that?
[431:27.10]We're going to have to break the Soul Stone.
[431:30.14]I have it with me, right?
[431:31.78]Yep.
[431:49.26]Hurry up and die.
[431:50.27]I want more tier lists.
[431:53.21]We're actually probably going to end it here pretty soon.
[431:59.97]I might not get to Diablo tonight.
[432:02.93]We'll probably can it for tonight soon.
[432:04.84]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[432:06.04]We're not going to do another 10 plus hour screen today.
[432:11.58]We'll can it after we do the soul stone.
[432:16.53]That'll bring us to about 8 hours.
[432:20.12]You just want to do a third D2 screen.
[432:22.70]Well, that's not what we're doing tomorrow.
[432:34.38]You're just going to die at Diablo.
[432:36.32]I'll look forward to it.
[432:42.99]Bastard sword.
[432:43.71]Let's take a look.
[432:44.69]Only one socket.
[432:45.53]Damn it.
[432:45.81]That's great.
[432:46.49]Minimum damage too.
[432:55.04]Finally, the Surge 2 tomorrow.
[432:56.48]No, it's co-op with Joel.
[432:59.33]Wait, let me just make sure that's actually... Let me just make sure that's happening.
[433:03.65]I think we're good to go.
[433:04.27]Let's just make sure we're gonna go for it.
[433:15.88]Should... Yeah, I think we're good to go.
[433:17.20]Tomorrow around 3 p.m.
[433:19.48]Pacific.
[433:21.10]We'll probably do some keep talking and nobody explodes.
[433:24.11]And I don't know, maybe we'll do something else too.
[433:27.67]We are officially, I believe, confirmed.
[433:55.22]One suck.
[433:56.12]Terrible.
[433:57.78]Terrible.
[433:59.28]And I don't get trapped here.
[434:02.51]Alright, would you guys get mad at me if I like did Mephisto like five times off screen?
[434:33.75]We would.
[434:34.63]Well... I don't know, I'm still alive!
[434:41.74]Here we go.
[434:42.28]Destroy the Soul Stone!
[434:43.52]We actually got it pretty quick.
[434:52.63]I couldn't think of anything funny to say for that one, sorry.
[435:04.10]What if I died off-screen?
[435:05.66]That would be so anti-climactic.
[435:12.05]I gotta get up.
[435:21.53]What do you need?
[435:38.20]What happened to my buddy?
[435:44.96]You sneezed in that guy's eyes.
[435:46.04]I did?
[435:47.56]Well, you'll be alright.
[435:48.50]Ain't nothing but a little sneeze.
[435:51.58]Do I do an angelic mantle?
[435:55.13]Yeah.
[435:55.47]Angelic's tough.
[436:10.21]Look at how many people are over there.
[436:12.18]Holy shit.
[436:12.58]I can't even see what's going to do.
[436:28.87]You lost 200 people when you went back to Diablo.
[436:43.76]We get some Taco Bell.
[436:44.68]Piece of Goody the Crunch.
[436:45.78]Get two of them.
[436:47.46]And a Water.
[436:49.78]Cut down on the Soap.
[437:04.18]Hey, tell him Jerm is dead.
[437:13.63]Alright, let's break this and see what we get for a rune.
[437:17.21]There is the guy.
[437:18.10]There is Hefasto the Armorer.
[437:43.17]Hellforge Hammer!
[437:45.49]Play this out, and let's crack the Soul Stone and get a bunch of cool gems.
[437:49.29]Now I want Taco Bell.
[438:02.37]Well, get it.
[438:03.93]You deserve it.
[438:05.51]You deserve Taco Bell.
[438:12.82]Alright, here we go.
[438:13.50]Protect me.
[438:18.33]Mash it.
[438:20.89]Use the hammer.
[438:21.57]Let's see what we get.
[438:28.88]Hit percentage.
[438:29.42]Flawless.
[438:36.18]Perfect emerald.
[438:37.04]Flawless emerald.
[438:38.16]Emerald fall.
[438:40.98]Oh, they're beautiful.
[438:44.48]Beautiful.
[438:46.82]Wait, weapon broken?
[438:53.03]Oh.
[438:53.95]So now what?
[438:55.43]Now... That's it.
[439:18.93]Now it's time to get Taco Bell.
[439:20.39]That sounds pretty good.
[439:25.24]I really like these Diablo screams.
[439:30.08]It gives us an avenue just to do whatever.
[439:32.24]I love it.
[439:37.20]It's only the second one.
[439:41.62]And I'm going to do it again.
[439:42.78]I'm going to do it until this character dies.
[439:47.98]Whatever that is.
[439:55.23]Alright, I've got... Too much shit.
[440:07.38]Too many gems.
[440:08.91]Too many runes.
[440:24.73]Alright, guys.
[440:28.37]We are probably about an hour and a half, depending, probably like an hour or so away from Diablo.
[440:36.87]And I have second thoughts on if it's going to be possible.
[440:41.53]So, we're going to try again.
[440:46.75]Move the skull before you leave.
[440:53.82]Pretty good.
[440:57.24]But I actually, I am kind of hungry.
[440:59.33]And I do want to get some sleep.
[441:04.37]Last night we did it for about 10 plus hours.
[441:06.63]But I don't really want to do a 10 hour stream right this moment.
[441:09.79]I want to eat.
[441:10.32]I haven't really eaten that much today.
[441:12.64]I want to get food.
[441:14.38]And then it's about 10, 11 o'clock.
[441:16.66]Coming on 10 o'clock Pacific.
[441:18.60]It's a good time to end it.
[441:21.66]Let's all go to Taco Bell.
[441:23.39]Well, I don't know.
[441:24.15]We'll see.
[441:25.45]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[441:30.32]Depending how long me and Joel play our co-op games, you may see the conclusion of the hardcore run tomorrow.
[441:46.37]Possible.
[441:46.75]Depending if I can beat Diablo tomorrow.
[441:48.57]And I'm saying tomorrow, but I don't know.
[441:50.43]We might play Keep Talking and maybe some other co-op stuff.
[441:52.71]Who knows?
[441:55.45]We made pretty good progress.
[441:58.51]Two more difficulties.
[442:00.13]That's true, but when you get to... I should have decent items.
[442:08.16]What about Bale?
[442:09.10]Oh, yeah.
[442:10.88]If this character stays alive, it stays alive.
[442:15.28]What if Joel doesn't do it again?
[442:18.58]Then it's Diablo week.
[442:24.39]No, no.
[442:24.83]That's not going to happen.
[442:30.43]Tommy Lebow.
[442:31.85]Looks pretty cool, don't it?
[442:33.31]Alright.
[442:35.85]Let's call it here.
[442:39.35]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[442:41.26]Starting probably around 3 to 4 p.m.
[442:45.74]Pacific.
[442:46.10]Tomorrow at 34.
[442:50.60]Typically, I think Joel streams pretty late, so we'll start around 3 to 4 p.m.
[442:56.35]Pacific.
[442:59.48]Good night, everybody.
[443:00.00]I missed... Freddie Dredd gave out another hundred fucking dollars.
[443:03.88]I was in the middle of fucking yelling about something.
[443:08.59]Freddie Dredd gave another... Freddie Dredd's over a thousand dollars in bits today.
[443:14.95]One thousand dollars and twenty-five dollars.
[443:18.83]Gosh, here's to S-tier.
[443:20.13]I was yelling about snacks.
[443:24.93]But holy fuck, Freddie.
[443:27.52]If you're still here,
[443:30.03]In one day, $1,000 worth of bits.
[443:39.92]That's crazy.
[443:43.12]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[443:44.10]We're going to do the bits.
[443:44.98]We'll chill for a little bit more.
[443:49.29]And we'll do the substitute.
[443:53.85]Have a great night.
[443:54.45]Have a great rest of your night.
[443:56.37]If you're calling a night, then have a good sleep.
[444:00.85]Take it easy.
[444:02.11]Those of you still here, we had some stuff come in.
[444:07.79]Five community subs from Z Marin.
[444:10.05]Thank you, Z Marin.
[444:13.71]Yagmendio, thanks for 300 bits.
[444:17.25]Hey, Jeremy, you've been my all-time favorite content creator, and I've grown up with your content.
[444:21.25]Thank you for everything you've done for me, in both defining my sense of humor and inspiring and making me laugh in life's darker moments.
[444:27.33]God bless.
[444:27.81]God bless.
[444:34.17]It's always interesting to think that somebody may have been watching this channel throughout their entire adolescent teenage years and now they're in college.
[444:45.78]They're all growing up.
[444:49.00]They're all getting so grown up.
[444:51.81]And so am I. Which is the scary part.
[445:00.57]But I really appreciate that.
[445:01.59]Thank you, Doug.
[445:04.61]Hey, minuaxis, thanks for the $3.30, 330 bits.
[445:08.03]Thanks for all the great streams, Jerma.
[445:12.25]I've been having a hard time with the people close to me for a while, and your streams always help cheer me up.
[445:16.69]Keep being yourself and having fun.
[445:21.51]Sorry to hear about that.
[445:24.75]But I plan on continuing just to do my thing.
[445:32.00]However that is, right?
[445:35.87]Thank you for the 330 bits.
[445:39.63]Hope it gets a little better.
[445:40.53]I know.
[445:44.63]It's just an aesthetic thing.
[445:46.54]I don't like the way it looks in the inventory.
[445:48.20]Clutter.
[445:48.48]I like having...
[446:00.89]Sixteen mana potions and twelve healing potions.
[446:04.77]Five different keys.
[446:05.65]I know, it's a hypocritical thing to say, I know.
[446:11.74]Thanks for the fifteen dollars.
[446:32.89]Drew, is it?
[446:35.31]Must purchase Nancy Drew.
[446:40.03]Well, I don't want to make you guys buy anything.
[446:46.53]Hey, the acidic vengeance thanks for the 500 bits.
[446:52.00]Jeremy wanted to apologize that I'm so rarely able to watch your streams.
[446:55.84]As a European, your stream times are late at night.
[446:57.72]I especially regret missing The Simpsons stream.
[447:00.62]Blah, blah, blah.
[447:01.56]I don't care about this message.
[447:09.59]That's so stupid.
[447:11.41]I know.
[447:12.09]And I see it, and I read it, and it's just... I know.
[447:16.10]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[447:20.28]I do.
[447:20.72]Don't ever apologize for not coming to a stream.
[447:24.43]They last a long time.
[447:27.46]But ever since moving to the West Coast, yes.
[447:30.46]The EU... That's why I brought the stream back to 2, 3, 4-ish p.m.
[447:36.96]in the afternoon.
[447:37.66]Because when I was in Boston, I started 7 p.m.
[447:44.26]my time.
[447:45.60]And I was late all the time, so it really turned out to be like 7.30, 7.45 my time.
[447:47.94]P.M.
[447:48.00]So I had to pull back...
[447:57.64]My time.
[447:58.96]To be able to make it so there was no change.
[448:01.46]Your time.
[448:01.94]You know what I mean?
[448:05.82]I pulled the stream back about four hours.
[448:09.72]Just to make it so it didn't start EU time like four o'clock in the morning or something.
[448:17.01]But I can't go much earlier than that.
[448:18.79]I really can't.
[448:20.43]I am not at my most energetic until at least somewhere in the middle of the afternoon.
[448:28.52]And streaming at like 10, 11, 12, I'm just not... I'm not gonna be able to do it.
[448:35.23]So unfortunately, most people in EU are between 8 and 10 plus hours ahead of me.
[448:44.33]There's nothing I can do about it.
[448:46.69]I'm sorry that you're missing streams.
[448:50.49]But... We live in this big world.
[448:53.63]It's 7am here now.
[449:03.69]it's a big world but if whenever you have time to catch it then welcome good to see you thank you for the 500 bits uh lucis thanks for the 500 bits
[449:25.52]Remember, your streams make working through my millions of scholarship applications a lot less tedious.
[449:31.73]Thanks for everything you do.
[449:32.59]By the way, it's pronounced Lucis.
[449:34.07]I got it right the first try.
[449:38.12]Well, hope you get one of those scholarships.
[449:43.42]Good luck.
[449:52.28]Noon to 3 p.m.
[449:53.42]Eastern will be perfect for EU and EST viewers.
[449:57.42]That's 9 o'clock in the morning for me.
[450:00.72]I'm not going to be able to get up at like 8.
[450:02.75]It's not going to happen.
[450:10.33]You don't want 8 a.m.
[450:12.33]jermaOn this stream.
[450:13.71]You don't.
[450:16.81]I am certain of that.
[450:31.82]E3 every day?
[450:39.27]Do it once?
[450:39.87]Can you see how groggy and irritable I am during those E3 streams?
[450:58.43]We had some community subs come in.
[450:59.57]Lord Repta, five community subs.
[451:02.23]Prilla D, five community subs.
[451:03.45]Thanks, both of you.
[451:10.29]Now, if you guys think that I can't reliably turn a stream on between, you know, 1 to 2 p.m.
[451:16.50]or, like, 2 to 3 p.m., you know how exponentially more unreliable I get every hour you go back?
[451:26.05]You are talking about scenarios where I will sleep through an entire stream.
[451:31.75]Oh, hey, I'm streaming it tomorrow at 8 a.m.
[451:34.05]between like 7 and 8 a.m.
[451:35.61]Pacific.
[451:37.21]I'm going to wake up at like 1130.
[451:38.09]And it's going to be like, oh, shit.
[451:42.31]No, no, no, I'm supposed to stream.
[451:45.47]And I'm going to fucking rip out of bed and throw water in my face.
[451:48.07]No, that's not happening.
[451:48.93]I'm going to sleep through every alarm.
[452:05.97]I think the sweet spot for me is somewhere between 1.30pm and like 3.30pm.
[452:13.94]Between like 1 and 4 is where almost every single stream is going to start.
[452:18.75]Depending on the day and who I'm playing with and what I'm doing.
[452:21.87]Do I have anything to do during the day or at night?
[452:24.03]That's the sweet spot for me.
[452:40.28]stream at 1 a.m I it's weird no my my I'm no I can't because then I'll that's just a up my sleep schedule forever if I turn a stream on at like 11 to 12 p.m like 11 to 12 a.m like 11 p.m to 12 or 1 a.m right
[453:04.27]I'm gonna be going to bed at like 7 o'clock in the morning.
[453:07.69]And then I'm just toast.
[453:09.73]You're just reversed forever.
[453:11.67]I've been on that schedule before and I hated it.
[453:16.07]I did not like it at all.
[453:20.84]It kind of fucks with you.
[453:23.58]You start to feel just strange.
[453:25.54]After three or four weeks of being on a schedule where you're going to sleep when the sun comes up, and waking up when the sun goes down, it's just... Ugh, after doing it for like... I did it for like four or five months, just total.
[453:40.21]Maybe like three months in a row, and it was just like, holy shit, I feel just odd.
[453:51.10]If you are able to do a true night shift...
[453:56.07]Then seriously more power to you because I could never do it.
[454:07.15]It's nice for a little while.
[454:08.13]It is nice for a little while.
[454:09.47]Because the world kind of turns off.
[454:12.11]And there's something inherently nice and relaxing and almost... It's like your own personal little world.
[454:18.77]Because there's nothing... There's no cars really going around.
[454:23.52]There's nobody calling you.
[454:26.46]You don't have an errand to do at 3.30 in the morning.
[454:29.12]4 in the morning.
[454:32.30]You get to live in your own personal little world.
[454:37.03]But once that overstays, you know, it just can get bad.
[454:47.04]For some people, they love it.
[454:48.40]And I hope you do.
[454:50.02]But anyway.
[454:58.98]Cream corn?
[455:00.92]Thanks for the 250.
[455:02.98]250 bits.
[455:04.22]I'm a long-time viewer here.
[455:05.18]Never knew that you'd love this game so dearly.
[455:06.86]Do you think you've played it more than TF2?
[455:19.09]I don't know.
[455:20.79]Probably not.
[455:23.41]Because...
[455:27.44]I had time constraints when I used to play this at its peak.
[455:32.10]About three to four hours a night.
[455:34.66]I played it every day for years.
[455:36.87]I played D2 every single day.
[455:38.89]Probably two or three years straight.
[455:42.03]But I was under time constraints because I was still in high school.
[455:47.17]So I couldn't stay up.
[455:49.37]I could only really play for a few hours a night.
[455:52.38]Team Fortress 2...
[455:54.84]was when I was in college and then after college.
[455:59.10]When I had every single day besides going to classes.
[456:05.46]So instead of three to four hours a day, I could play TF2 for like eight to ten.
[456:13.52]So... He didn't study.
[456:22.89]A six-hour session in TF2 was like, ah, that was awesome.
[456:28.43]So just based on that alone, that I didn't have as many time constraints as I did when I was a teenager, I would say yes, TF2 probably at least 30% more.
[456:43.28]Doug Mendio, thanks again for 500 bits.
[456:46.87]What would be your advice for motivation for a project?
[456:50.30]I have albums worth of music and my girlfriend really wants to see me finish the record, but sometimes I feel a bit scared to finish it.
[456:56.06]Just do it.
[457:00.22]Finish it.
[457:03.18]Because you don't know what the end product is until it's done.
[457:06.63]And I know we're getting the foreheads here.
[457:09.21]Right?
[457:09.53]Just do it, forehead.
[457:15.15]But you have to take shots.
[457:19.11]There's no such thing as a hypothetical shot.
[457:22.39]You have to take it.
[457:23.51]You have to.
[457:24.53]There's no hypothetical shot.
[457:26.55]That's the Wayne Gretzky quote.
[457:27.93]It's true.
[457:33.89]You miss 100% of the shots that you don't take.
[457:38.39]Wayne Gretzky, smarter than Albert Einstein is that quote.
[457:54.30]So, you don't know, you might finish whatever you're doing and go, holy shit, this is great, this is awesome, I'm going to do it again.
[458:02.81]Rather than hypothetically thinking what might happen if you do or do not do it.
[458:13.83]You can't miss if you don't shoot, though.
[458:15.39]It makes no logical sense.
[458:20.78]Well, then, revise it.
[458:23.43]If you don't take any shots, you don't have an opportunity to make any goals.
[458:36.62]There you go.
[458:39.24]If you don't take any shots, one day you are going to die.
[458:43.20]Yes, of all of us eventually, sure.
[458:53.92]But you could say that you could you could say If if you cut your lawn tomorrow eventually one day you'll die That could be done if you drink water today, you'll die eventually No, I won't I won't die
[459:23.43]Oh, MonkaS, I'm drinking water right now.
[459:31.15]But yeah, you just have to let yourself do it.
[459:32.97]You just have to try to do it.
[459:34.95]Try to finish it.
[459:36.03]See how you feel when you're done.
[459:39.59]You might have great things to say.
[459:41.55]You don't know?
[459:41.95]Give it a try.
[459:46.98]Hey Aerolus, thanks for the 250 bits.
[459:48.90]Didn't you say like five years ago that when co-op was available in Stardew Valley, you'd play it again?
[459:53.16]I did say that.
[459:54.22]But then I watched my girlfriend 100% the whole game.
[459:58.81]So... I kind of went out the window.
[460:04.01]Kim 100%ed the entire game.
[460:07.03]And I sat behind her or on the couch and watched almost the whole thing.
[460:14.90]I got to be the viewer this time.
[460:27.37]Stardew Valley.
[460:36.09]Why didn't she let you sit next to her on the couch?
[460:38.60]No, I'm saying, like, I was just there, sitting there.
[460:43.56]The word behind, I was like, I was behind you!
[460:45.06]Like, just, I mean, like, I was there.
[460:47.54]Not in the front, in center, doing the thing.
[460:49.85]I was, like, behind you.
[460:50.67]I was, like, not doing it.
[460:56.09]Look, you eat 100% of the Twinkies that you fucking open, okay?
[461:01.87]You eat 100% of the Twinkies of the Twinkie box.
[461:10.50]In one sitting.
[461:11.10]Just be careful.
[461:16.88]I know it seems like a good idea, but it never is.
[461:25.12]Hey, Freddy Dredd again.
[461:26.00]Uh, yes.
[461:28.74]Just want to reiterate one more time.
[461:30.74]Hope you have fun in Vegas.
[461:32.58]Ash House, a go-go blue cheeseburger.
[461:34.14]Hope you like it.
[461:35.12]One of my favorite spots in all of Las Vegas.
[461:38.16]The link.
[461:39.78]Thanks for your thousand dollars plus.
[461:42.54]In bits, too.
[461:44.34]So that's even more that you had to spend.
[461:46.30]Thank you.
[461:49.07]Have a great time.
[461:50.53]It's a great city.
[461:58.68]Hey, Chibi!
[461:59.58]Thanks for the 400 bits.
[462:01.22]Hi, Jerma.
[462:01.50]Hope you're enjoying Diablo II so far.
[462:03.04]I do.
[462:03.28]It's one of my favorite games.
[462:05.36]Love your streams a lot, and it's fun seeing you play my grandpa's favorite game.
[462:08.41]I haven't been able to grab him to come watch with me yet, but he hopes you have a good time as well.
[462:14.97]P.S.
[462:15.35]The Tristram Town theme slaps.
[462:24.83]It does.
[462:26.35]Very iconic.
[462:30.44]Let us put the sub... The sub... Credits on.
[462:43.47]Got a couple more bits to do, but let's get this to run.
[462:47.75]Thanks for sticking around the Diablo streams, guys.
[462:49.93]I know they might not be the most exciting streams that I've ever done, but they are fun.
[462:54.83]I do enjoy them.
[462:57.54]Not a lot of people have actually stuck around for them, so I hope you like it.
[463:01.74]You're having a good time.
[463:08.33]Here come the credits.
[463:08.97]Let's change the scene.
[463:09.83]Gonna bump you here.
[463:11.33]Sorry about that.
[463:16.72]Here are all the subs that subbed on this stream.
[463:20.84]Thanks again.
[463:22.60]All of you.
[463:40.92]With the old pistol.
[463:44.38]No, no, no.
[463:44.90]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[463:45.46]Alright.
[463:46.08]Is that a garden hose?
[463:57.81]Are we sure this is not a garden hose?
[464:04.34]He's holding a garden hose.
[464:05.72]Alright, I don't... Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[464:12.69]I don't want to show... Alright, that's like... I don't want to show, like, a garden hose.
[464:16.05]I don't want to show... No, no, no, no.
[464:26.86]I don't want to show, like, a brand, like, pointing a gun at me.
[464:30.00]Like, that's... That's fucking funny from the stream's perspective.
[464:37.08]Uh, what is it?
[464:37.92]Fun garden hose.
[464:44.83]Oh, okay.
[464:45.29]I can't laugh that hard.
[464:46.63]Alright, now.
[465:03.17]Holy shit, Jerma sounds like a bizarro psychic right now.
[465:06.29]Why?
[465:06.57]Is this an old clip?
[465:12.81]What is it?
[465:13.13]Wait till he lands, wait till he lands.
[465:18.45]Is that Mr. Peanut?
[465:34.99]I thought it was Mr. Peanut.
[465:38.91]Did they kill that character off or does he still exist?
[465:42.31]Is Mr. Peanut dead in canon?
[465:44.85]Holy shit.
[465:46.99]This is like two years.
[465:47.75]This is like three years ago.
[465:48.93]Shit.
[465:53.40]It's just this.
[466:00.14]It's a Twitter video, so it's impossible to play.
[466:05.61]The prophecy has been fulfilled.
[466:07.11]No, it's been at least a year and a half.
[466:16.75]I moved to Vegas in October of 2018.
[466:20.46]It's been at least like a year and a half almost.
[466:26.94]And this is back in the old office.
[466:35.97]The wasp is, yeah, the wasp was more than a year and a half ago.
[466:44.45]Yeah.
[466:45.95]Been a while.
[466:47.13]I've been in Vegas for almost a year and a half.
[466:51.73]Please don't predict any more deaths.
[466:59.11]Well, I'll try not to.
[467:06.63]Anywho, we had $8, 800 bits from an anonymous cheerer.
[467:11.48]Just anonymous.
[467:15.24]Thank you, whoever you are.
[467:17.78]Loud.
[467:20.20]Thank you for the $8 anonymous cheerer.
[467:21.76]Appreciate it.
[467:22.24]800 bits.
[467:24.01]ItTheCaz, thanks for 500 bits.
[467:25.61]Hey, Jerma.
[467:25.97]I have a question.
[467:27.15]Is Abu the narrator on How It's Made?
[467:29.33]That would be probably a better show if he was.
[467:44.99]Uh, we have a couple more to do.
[467:46.29]We've got... What do we got here?
[467:48.55]We have 250 from YesesOnline.
[467:51.57]I like giving you money, people happy.
[467:56.54]I will take... I will accept these bits.
[467:58.70]Thank you.
[467:59.18]I will take them.
[468:00.98]That makes me people happy.
[468:03.97]That makes you people happy.
[468:06.11]People.
[468:08.79]For sure.
[468:09.81]Happy birthday, Andrew.
[468:11.35]Hope you have a good one.
[468:12.41]You know, I went to college once.
[468:13.43]Sick.
[468:39.06]Hold on, Otto is... Otto wants... Hold on.
[468:41.24]What is the matter?
[468:43.74]What is it?
[468:44.70]You wanna get out of here?
[468:46.34]Just wait one second.
[468:47.21]I'm gonna come with you.
[468:49.17]Uh, what was... Oh yeah, happy birth.
[468:51.31]Otto, what's the matter?
[468:52.95]He's like, no, now.
[468:54.75]He's like, not later, now.
[468:58.47]Can you sit for a sec?
[468:59.73]Just wait, like, ten seconds.
[469:03.44]Otto says happy birthday.
[469:07.28]There you go.

[471:21.57]Ah!
[471:22.31]Why?
[471:22.59]A couple weeks ago, I saw a clip of you playing Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion and becoming so scared you did a perfect Amen Break.
[471:32.72]I had to see more.
[471:33.74]So the first dream I caught was Nancy Drew with all the lipstick shenanigans.
[471:40.52]And I knew I was here for life.
[471:43.00]Your voice is very soothing to me.
[471:44.36]I also wanted you to know, I saw you described as the king of jesters, but he'll never know it.
[471:51.65]All he knows is his miserable jingling and his miserable jests.
[471:57.45]Love you, Boston King.
[472:03.09]Miserable?
[472:04.09]Miserable jingling?

[472:28.83]Unfortunate.
[472:29.75]Unfortunate.
[472:32.78]Yeah.
[472:33.00]It happens.
[472:53.89]and then it takes you so long to fix because even if you stay up I'm gonna stay up all day and all night and then I'm gonna fix it and I'm gonna bet it don't doesn't work you end up sleeping the same amount of time in different random time you'll wake up after four hours stay up and then sleep for six hours sucks
[473:23.38]How do you fix it?
[473:25.06]You wanna know the real way to fix your sleep schedule?
[473:27.80]And I mean this, this is no bullshit, this is true, this is actually real.
[473:32.27]It's with food.
[473:34.47]You have to eat... at normal times.
[473:42.16]If you do not wait till you are hungry to eat at 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning,
[473:49.80]Your body will start to regulate itself around your clock of eating food So if you just try to keep your meals out of like the wild zone It actually can help Am I serious?
[474:12.83]No, I'm serious
[474:17.89]Look it up.
[474:18.29]It actually, like, eating at, like, normal times, like, keeps you regular.
[474:23.33]No, this ain't fake.
[474:23.97]No, it's not.
[474:25.09]I promise.
[474:35.79]Yeah.
[474:36.61]How to fix your sleep schedule.
[474:40.55]A late dinner can delay sleep, so eat your last meal two to three hours before you go to bed.
[474:46.63]This will give your body enough time to digest the meal.
[474:49.14]Eating dinner around the same time each day will also get your body used to into a routine.
[474:53.92]Yeah, you want to try to eat at the same time and eat... You want to eat early.
[475:00.49]No, it's real.
[475:01.77]You can help reset your body clock by doing it with food.
[475:04.57]Yeah, I know, it's real.
[475:10.63]It helped.
[475:11.05]I remember I did it.
[475:11.93]And it actually does help a little bit.
