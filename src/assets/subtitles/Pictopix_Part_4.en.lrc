[01:19.86]499,000.
[01:21.70]That's not 500,000, you just made me celebrate for something that's not even real.
[01:36.29]Is that a lot?
[01:37.81]That's a lot, right?
[01:39.97]That's a lot.
[01:43.66]500,000 followers?

[01:48.82]700,000?
[01:48.84]Wow.
[01:56.93]That's a lot.
[01:57.45]Yeah, that is a lot.
[01:59.27]Not even seven figures laughing my ass off.
[02:03.83]Hey, we're halfway to seven figures.
[02:06.39]That's what you meant to say.
[02:08.49]Hey, the glass is half full.
[02:11.53]Glass is not half empty.
[02:12.51]Glass is half full.
[02:14.74]Now give me some more orange juice or I'm going to complain to the fucking manager.
[02:18.44]Somebody just gave 10 subs.
[02:24.37]a tangy hey tang dynasties thanks for the 10 subs so um we have there's a lot of shit we have to talk about a lot of things to discuss I feel like this is like a company update stream this is like a business update company uh like newsletter stream that's what this is gonna be
[02:45.98]First of all, thank you for the insane support on the last stream.
[02:52.00]We broke over 50,000 concurrent viewers.
[02:55.86]Which, that's fucking insane.
[02:57.68]That's double what the highest view count I've ever had was.
[03:05.65]It's remarkable.
[03:06.53]I can't even believe it.
[03:09.47]And yes, I know we were not prepared for the enthusiasm, I guess, for the Grotto Beasts stuff.
[03:19.63]What?
[03:20.19]I know everybody has a ton of questions about Grotto Beasts.
[03:23.07]Like, from every angle.
[03:24.25]It's like, hey, hey, hey, tell us more about Grotto Beasts.
[03:27.03]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[03:28.74]Hit the brakes for a second.
[03:30.77]They're... Just hit the brakes.
[03:34.41]I know everyone's really excited about it.
[03:36.87]I can't... We... Just give me a few weeks.
[03:40.27]Please.
[03:41.67]I... Trust me when I say I want to be screaming about the stuff.
[03:45.45]But... I... We can't... We have to just wait a few weeks.
[03:49.36]Give me a few weeks.
[03:50.16]We're still... I need like a company policy fucking generic PR statement.
[03:56.42]Where do I get it from?
[03:59.79]I need a generic company PR statement.
[04:04.17]Let me Google one.
[04:06.18]Generic PR statement.
[04:12.44]Okay, let's see.
[04:13.16]Generic PR statement.
[04:16.04]I've got to get a good one here.
[04:17.10]Because just... I can't... How do I word this?
[04:21.56]What you... When you... How to make a statement to the media.
[04:24.50]Free press release template.
[04:30.29]This one says talk is cheap.
[04:33.97]Anyways.
[04:38.30]Just hold off for a little bit.
[04:40.70]There's tons of projects in the works.
[04:42.50]There's tons of announcements that I have.
[04:44.36]Lots of them.
[04:46.31]There are probably five projects that are in the works.
[04:49.25]And these are not things you're going to see a year from now.
[04:51.17]This stuff is hitting the ground running.
[04:53.52]And there's going to be major, major shit to talk about.
[04:55.68]Over the next three weeks.
[04:58.72]Which leads me to the next thing we're about to talk about.
[05:01.86]So because of the amount of projects that are being worked on.
[05:04.68]And the amount of stuff that's happening.
[05:06.26]Remember 2020 got all fucked up here.
[05:09.07]A ton of projects got moved to 2021.
[05:12.69]I have to get this medical stuff under control.
[05:15.03]I have to.
[05:18.28]It's getting to a point now where there's so many interesting things that are going to be happening over the next six months.
[05:25.35]I have to get a procedure done.
[05:27.39]I have to do it.
[05:28.89]So... I hate... I hate... I don't want to say it, but I have to.
[05:35.83]I have to go on another break.
[05:38.20]Because I'm going to be doing a bunch of doctor's appointments.
[05:41.28]And I'm actually going to try as hard as I can to get a procedure done.
[05:45.94]I'm probably going to get injections.
[05:47.72]Whether that's intercostal injections or trigger point injections into my back area, into my chest area.
[05:52.55]We have to try a real treatment plan here.
[05:56.87]Because there's too many things going on this year.
[05:59.61]I have to not be like... Hold on.
[06:03.14]Yeah, give me a minute.
[06:04.16]Ah!
[06:05.19]I can't, yeah, I gotta sit down for like an hour.
[06:08.19]There's too much shit going on.
[06:09.71]I have to take care of this.
[06:12.79]So, I'm not going to go on break for as long as I did last time.
[06:15.27]Last time was to make sure I didn't have anything really major or horrible going on.
[06:21.80]I spent like two or three months somewhere in the middle of 2020.
[06:24.98]That was to rule out everything that could have been really bad.
[06:29.60]And we did.
[06:30.98]So, I came back.
[06:33.70]I changed my kind of streaming policy.
[06:35.72]It helped a lot.
[06:38.06]That, like, four to six hours instead of, like, seven to eight hours, like, really was helpful.
[06:42.90]But now it's time to actually get a... I need to get something done.
[06:47.74]I have to get a procedure done.
[06:50.00]So the next, I would assume, probably three weeks.
[06:53.67]And this is not three weeks into two months.
[06:56.35]I promise.
[06:58.03]I am going to go get something done.
[07:00.65]And I will be back.
[07:02.45]And I'll be back on...
[07:06.11]this is not intentional but you know it I'm the please trust me what I say being me coming back on April 1st is not like a joke stream I'm coming back on April 1st so maybe maybe I will do something I don't know just keep an eye out but this whole break is not to have something weird happen on the first something weird probably just will happen on the first
[07:29.59]So I want to make sure that's out there.
[07:32.02]I have a lot of personal stuff.
[07:33.20]I have a lot of family stuff and medical stuff that I need.
[07:38.68]I got to close the book on this shit.
[07:41.06]That's TL;DR.
[07:43.18]Now, what this means for you is when I come back, I probably shouldn't do this on the first.
[07:51.29]I'm going to have like four announcements, like major announcements.
[07:55.87]I shouldn't do that.
[07:56.36]Should I do that on the first of April?
[07:57.86]I feel like people think that was a joke.
[08:00.95]Maybe I'll do it on the 2nd of April.
[08:03.85]Okay, so April 2nd, you can expect a bunch of major announcements.
[08:08.36]So I'm not going to do this on the 1st.
[08:12.42]Save the announcements for after.
[08:13.62]Do it on the 1st, that'll be funny.
[08:25.39]It'll be wicked funny.
[08:28.17]But let me tell you, I have to be very clear.
[08:30.65]I'm overwhelmed by the shit that you guys have been saying.
[08:37.11]Everyone's been so supportive.
[08:39.61]I've seen so much.
[08:40.91]I think at one point, this stream was trending on Twitter, like number two in the United States.
[08:48.16]When I was told that, I was like, you're a liar.
[08:50.08]That didn't happen.
[08:50.66]It was a joke.
[08:52.00]You made that up.
[08:53.86]I was like, no.
[08:54.42]I was getting sent screenshots and shit.
[08:56.16]It's like, what the fuck is going on?
[09:00.02]And I'm really, really also happy to see that Nevada Science Center, a lot of you guys are supporting those guys.
[09:07.30]And they were so, so nice to do that.
[09:09.66]They put up with a lot of my bullshit.
[09:11.45]So I'm really happy to see you guys are actually supporting them.
[09:15.79]It's really good to see.
[09:21.62]So, TL;DR, tons of major shit that you're going to hear about on April 2nd.
[09:27.69]I'll be back on April 1st.
[09:30.13]I'll see you later.
[09:30.61]Alright, goodbye.
[09:31.51]No, I'm just kidding.
[09:31.99]We're not going to stop there.
[09:33.55]We're going to chill today.
[09:34.17]I'm going to play Picross, and I'm going to not answer any questions at all about anything because I can't.
[09:40.61]So, let's just hang out for a while.
[09:42.20]Just leave already.
[09:44.06]Just leave.
[09:46.04]No, I can't leave right now.
[09:47.24]I'm here.
[09:47.68]I'm right here.
[09:52.27]Did somebody say that was a really shitty direct?
[09:57.09]Can you imagine if that was a direct?
[10:02.34]It's just, like, Doug Bowser comes on the screen.
[10:05.36]He's like, alright, so, I mean, I can't really talk about any of this stuff.
[10:08.22]But, like, I mean, like, Mario's cool.
[10:10.58]We got this Mario guy.
[10:11.80]And, like, you might see him, maybe.
[10:13.90]I don't know.
[10:14.60]I don't have any fucking idea.
[10:16.28]Thanks for all the support, guys, on, like, Mario 2.
[10:21.06]It's like a 10 minute thing of him just bumbling around, just not answering questions.
[10:29.26]He's actually, he's like, somebody Google me a generic PR statement.
[10:34.48]In front of like a gray, white background where he's just sitting there like green screened in.
[10:42.12]You're so handsome.
[10:43.26]I'm not even on screen.
[10:52.57]Do you think your surgeon will recognize you as the Among Us guy?
[10:57.29]I hope so.
[11:00.13]Although, maybe not.
[11:01.01]I kind of hope not.
[11:02.81]Don't you feel like he would, like, deliberately kill me?
[11:07.97]Oh, you're the Among Us guy!
[11:09.44]Yeah, that's me.
[11:10.64]Oh, wow!
[11:13.42]I like the gas and, like, the anesthesia's going in.
[11:17.38]I fucking hate that meme.
[11:20.58]You're never gonna wake up again.
[11:26.09]And I'm just like... I gotta get my last thing out right before I die.
[11:29.93]Just right before I go out.
[11:30.71]I'm like... That was pretty sus.
[11:34.63]Can we get a face cam?
[11:45.28]No.
[11:48.50]Why did you moan?
[11:49.26]No, that was like, I'm going under from the anesthesia.
[11:56.50]Like, nobody, you don't know what sound you make when you're under anesthesia, when you go, like, have surgery.
[12:01.64]They make you count back for some 10, and then you just wake up in a bed.
[12:05.90]You don't, who knows what sound you could be making.
[12:08.06]It's like, ugh, or ugh, or ugh.
[12:12.76]Those of you that have had anesthesia before, you're just like, you're sitting there.
[12:16.22]Okay, I'm lying here.
[12:17.24]I'm ready.
[12:18.51]I guess I get, I woke up in a bed.
[12:22.15]Oh, what happened?
[12:24.25]Oh, it's done.
[12:24.95]Oh, alright.
[12:27.13]Weird.
[12:29.69]So who knows what sound you make?
[12:36.21]What do you mean stop, stop?
[12:37.25]What?
[12:38.15]Like in a hospital.
[12:50.06]Don't get too excited that I'm not playing Heroes of Might and Magic 3.
[12:53.24]I'm just playing the soundtrack for you.
[12:56.99]A lot of people really just got really excited because that's the intro to Heroes of Might and Magic.
[13:00.25]It's like, no, we're playing Picross.
[13:04.61]That's one of the nice OST.
[13:09.61]Oh my God, he's going to minimize it.
[13:10.91]He's going to be in the next campaign.
[13:15.44]So we're going to play Picross and just chill.
[13:20.10]I can't wait to talk about some of these things.
[13:27.05]Play Heroes.
[13:27.75]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[13:29.75]We'll do that when I... I don't know.
[13:31.17]I don't know.
[13:31.45]We'll do it when I come back.
[13:33.03]Give us that now.
[13:37.63]Let me just get back to... Let me figure out how to play this game again.
[13:41.53]I think it's a cloud save file.
[13:43.99]Let's do this one.
[13:44.51]Open this one.
[13:46.75]Can I open this?
[13:47.15]There we go.
[13:49.27]So if you don't know how to play Picross, let me show you how it's done.
[13:51.35]I actually don't.
[13:52.33]I forget everything.
[13:54.00]We're going to take some learning here.
[13:57.32]It's been years since the last Picross stream.
[13:59.54]It's been, I don't know, like... Maybe like six, eight months?
[14:05.30]He's doing a tuber voice again.
[14:06.72]What are you talking about?
[14:08.08]What do you mean?
[14:09.58]I'm not doing a tuber voice right now.
[14:12.08]Stop getting in my head.
[14:14.83]So, if you don't know how to play Picross, we'll do a quick TL;DR, first of all.
[14:19.19]Uh, so these are squares that need to be filled in.
[14:22.27]So there needs to be 13 squares filled in on this... column, right?
[14:27.49]A row is this way.
[14:29.32]I don't know where they are, I just know there's 13 of them, but I can deduce, with logic, reasoning, and skill, that I know where these could be, and it makes a picture.
[14:39.36]Eventually, it makes a picture.
[14:42.68]Thanks for the tutorial.
[14:45.16]Everyone knows how to play Picross.
[14:46.70]Oh, really?
[14:47.18]Because when I played it a year ago, everyone was like, what is this garbage?
[14:50.29]Get it off the screen.
[14:51.37]And then half of you got addicted to it the next day.
[14:56.45]So let me deduce here.
[14:57.19]So how many was it?
[14:58.33]15 by 15?
[14:58.59]That means that there has to be.
[15:02.53]This has to be correct.
[15:03.32]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[15:04.58]Therefore, these middle ones have to be here.
[15:14.25]Now we can do some deduction.
[15:16.97]Or can we?
[15:17.57]I'm not sure.
[15:17.99]There's only four in this row.
[15:20.99]Can I do anything?
[15:21.45]And by the way, for those of you that have never played this before, if there is a space between numbers, it means there has to be at least one space in between.
[15:30.28]Has to be.
[15:31.34]So for instance, if one was right here, there would have to be a space for the next one.
[15:35.66]Have to be.
[15:37.68]That was incorrect.
[15:39.56]Deduction Andy.
[15:40.26]Yeah.
[15:42.57]Is your mother approved of this game?
[15:44.14]My mother plays this game.
[15:45.28]So, I'm sure she does.
[15:46.40]What about color?
[15:51.24]Color doesn't matter.
[15:54.82]Is it custom map?
[15:55.76]Oh, yeah.
[15:56.06]Oh, yeah.
[15:56.60]I'm just going to get back into the swing of things.
[15:57.94]We'll play the custom ones.
[15:58.74]We'll go in the workshop.
[16:00.84]So, it's 15.
[16:02.14]So, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[16:04.14]So, that means... Hold on.
[16:05.86]Let me see.
[16:07.67]I always hate when I don't get a bunch of free ones down here.
[16:09.77]I need the bingo free space down here.
[16:13.53]Four, one, three, three, one.
[16:15.35]This could be the one.
[16:19.49]Single eight means one square in the middle.
[16:22.47]Yeah, right.
[16:22.99]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[16:26.11]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[16:30.05]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[16:32.63]Right, okay.
[16:33.59]So that has to be where, one of them has to be here.
[16:37.48]Has to be.
[16:42.25]Your mom plays this?
[16:43.25]This is Jerma's mom playing.
[16:44.43]It's pre-recorded.
[16:47.07]Is this too hard?
[16:47.92]It's not too hard.
[16:48.78]Trust me when I say it isn't.
[16:51.12]I've only got 10 here.
[16:51.64]11.
[16:51.66]5 and... The second 8.
[16:54.48]Oh, where is it?
[16:57.36]Okay, here we go.
[16:57.94]Yeah, because that 8 has to be 1 here.
[17:04.64]Then we got these two.
[17:05.42]This is part of the five.
[17:06.52]Has to be right.
[17:08.14]So one, two, three, four, five.
[17:10.66]Or one, two, three, four, five.
[17:14.86]I wonder.
[17:16.18]Three and the eight.
[17:16.85]Oh, here we go.
[17:17.33]Yep, right, right, right.
[17:20.55]This is the two.
[17:20.97]Alright, bingo.
[17:22.17]So check this out.
[17:23.03]See what we have just deduced?
[17:24.41]Do you see what we just deduced?
[17:26.35]This has to be that two.
[17:27.97]Block it off.
[17:28.69]There's your two.
[17:29.91]Now one is somewhere over here.
[17:33.48]Are you guys excited about this yet?
[17:39.13]So that means 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[17:41.73]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[17:43.05]This has to be right here.
[17:44.45]So this is part of the 1.
[17:45.93]Check that out.
[17:46.53]This is one of the 1s.
[17:53.47]Because there can't be one here.
[17:55.65]So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[17:59.14]You got it.
[17:59.56]You're understanding it.
[18:01.24]I'm gonna drop a deuce.
[18:02.62]Hehehehehe.
[18:04.02]Alright.
[18:04.42]That's funny.
[18:05.98]That's freaking funny.
[18:12.40]Did you catch the game last night?
[18:15.34]Did you have any hot fudge sundaes?
[18:17.64]What grade are you in school?
[18:21.81]My brain hurts.
[18:25.94]Clap, clap, clap.
[18:26.72]Let's go, let's go.
[18:27.48]This is a boomer game.
[18:28.14]Yeah, well, I just told you I wanted to relax today.
[18:30.66]I wanted to tell you about some of the important projects going on and the fact that I'm literally taking a three-week break.
[18:35.19]Alright, what do I do?
[18:37.95]Okay.
[18:38.63]I know I gotta tell him I'm taking medical leave again.
[18:41.55]Should I play Picross for a few hours and tell him I'm leaving?
[18:47.87]Oh shit, hold on.
[18:48.45]Wait a minute, this is important.
[18:50.29]One, two, three, four, five.
[18:52.80]One, two, three, four, five.
[18:54.48]Bingo, check this out.
[18:55.46]One, two, three, four, five.
[18:57.18]One, two, three, four, five.
[18:59.66]It's gotta be like here.
[19:00.65]It has to be here.
[19:01.33]This is part of the four.
[19:05.15]It has to be somewhere in here, the five.
[19:09.77]Bingo.
[19:10.85]Tell mom to stream in your absence.
[19:14.53]My mother would take one second on this stream and look over and be like, son, why do you do this?
[19:23.38]Why?
[19:24.18]Did you see what they were saying?
[19:25.48]And I'd be like, ma, ma, ma, money.
[19:29.87]It's not, what do you mean money?
[19:31.95]I didn't raise you like that to care about money.
[19:36.20]You're like, Ma, Ma, just relax.
[19:38.43]I'm making money.
[19:40.43]No, no, you're supposed to do it because you love it and you love doing it.
[19:44.89]No, no.
[19:46.97]Remember when you first made your first YouTube video, how much you thought that was fun and how you were just doing it for fun.
[19:53.08]Yeah, it's time to change, Ma.
[19:56.86]No, it's not the son that I made.
[20:01.09]Yeah, Ma, Ma, get out of here, Ma!
[20:03.01]You don't get it!
[20:04.89]Oh, my son!
[20:06.47]He went down to the dark side!
[20:09.83]And then I have a really deep realization, like, 45 minutes later in the movie.
[20:14.93]And I, like, understand now, and I go back to, like, how I began, and I, like, do it because I love it.
[20:24.07]That's after I throw her in the volcano, by the way.
[20:26.75]I just want to make sure you guys understand where we are in the movie.
[20:38.45]Alright, let's keep going.
[20:39.35]We gotta deduce this.
[20:40.45]So this is part of the four.
[20:43.12]Okay, hold on.
[20:44.28]So if this is the part of the four, that means there has to be two ones after this.
[20:49.12]That means it'd have to be this, right?
[20:53.05]This has to be where it is because there's no way this, the four will fit.
[20:55.79]So this has to be the four.
[20:56.69]There you go.
[20:57.85]This is done.
[20:58.27]Very cool.
[20:59.88]Now, here we go.
[21:00.72]Perfect deduction.
[21:01.52]Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:03.34]Oh my God.
[21:03.82]I'm sorry.
[21:04.22]I don't know what the fuck's wrong with me.
[21:05.16]It's supposed to be a winding down hangout stream where I tell you that I'm whatever.
[21:08.72]Alright.
[21:09.90]So one, two, three, four.
[21:12.72]It cannot possibly be higher than that.
[21:14.28]And it also cannot possibly be lower than this.
[21:16.52]Two, three, four.
[21:17.40]So here you go.
[21:20.22]Ain't nothing over here.
[21:22.62]But it could be up here.
[21:24.70]This also has to be part of the four.
[21:26.68]Therefore... One, two, three, four.
[21:31.66]Nothing.
[21:32.00]It can't be over here.
[21:33.62]One, two, three, four.
[21:34.62]It could be there, right?
[21:36.44]Technically.
[21:41.77]This is where it gets interesting.
[21:43.79]So this is part of the three.
[21:45.57]The one, two, three, or one, two, three.
[21:49.72]This has to be the second three.
[21:51.82]Because one, two, three.
[21:54.88]Even if it was this way.
[21:56.74]Oh, no.
[21:57.36]No, no, no, no.
[21:58.04]It could be that.
[21:59.10]I don't know that for certain.
[22:01.28]I can't be certain of that.
[22:04.53]I'm too dumb to understand this.
[22:05.85]Do the eight column.
[22:07.93]Oh, right.
[22:08.27]We got some more info here and here.
[22:10.53]So this has to be part of the eight.
[22:13.91]I guess it doesn't have... What does it?
[22:15.03]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[22:17.31]It does.
[22:18.59]Okay.
[22:20.16]Did that give us any more info here?
[22:21.28]This is either two or the three.
[22:24.47]This is the two.
[22:25.03]I feel like I'm in a Zoom meeting.
[22:28.22]Like a Zoom class.
[22:44.86]You know what?
[22:46.28]That is the worst insult ever.
[22:48.84]It's such an insult, like it just is.
[22:52.43]That's a perfect insult.
[22:54.57]You didn't say this stream sucks.
[22:56.13]You didn't say like, oh, wow, this is kind of boring.
[22:58.25]You said this is like a Zoom meeting, dude.
[23:00.13]And it's like, that's the worst thing where you could have described this at all.
[23:06.71]It's the teacher.
[23:07.41]Alright, so let's see.
[23:10.23]One, two, three, four, five.
[23:12.11]One, two, three, four, five.
[23:14.07]Could also go down here.
[23:15.99]Yeah, we can do this one down here as well.
[23:18.25]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[23:20.87]Therefore, so these are good.
[23:24.29]One, two, three, four, five.
[23:27.15]Okay, so this is part of the two, which means this is probably done.
[23:32.93]Yeah, that's definitely the two, which therefore this is gone.
[23:36.49]This has to be the two, right?
[23:37.83]There's no way this is the three.
[23:40.44]Yeah, this has to be the two.
[23:42.68]Look at how much we're learning here.
[23:45.70]No, no, wrong, wrong, wrong.
[23:46.72]No, no, no.
[23:47.08]What do you mean?
[23:47.54]What, what, what?
[23:48.00]Wait, wait, wait.
[23:48.40]What are you talking about?
[23:51.50]What's wrong?
[23:53.78]One, two, three, four, five.
[23:56.26]One, two, three, four, five.
[23:58.81]Yeah, it could be.
[23:59.73]It has to be these three.
[24:01.37]I had it right.
[24:04.01]This could be the five?
[24:06.51]Oh, wait, you're right.
[24:07.97]Because this could be like that.
[24:10.13]I see what you mean.
[24:10.79]Okay.
[24:11.43]Yeah, actually, I don't know that info.
[24:12.67]You're right.
[24:14.77]This is... This is not... This is the three.
[24:19.10]Because there's no way this is the five.
[24:20.26]So this is definitely part of the three.
[24:23.30]So if it was one, two, three, there you go.
[24:24.96]Bingo.
[24:25.40]Okay.
[24:25.86]I don't know that for certain yet.
[24:29.76]This teacher sucks.
[24:33.86]There are 12,000 people here.
[24:36.94]Yeah, I know.
[24:38.98]And we're doing a... Yeah, welcome.
[24:42.10]Hi, everybody.
[24:44.96]Where else can I go here?
[24:46.59]Can't do anything in here.
[24:48.27]Or can I?
[24:51.23]Make a sentry noise so they don't leave.
[24:53.05]Well, if they're going to leave, they're going to leave.
[24:54.99]I can't tell them, but they have to stay here.
[24:59.31]You better not leave.
[25:00.89]Just make that really clear.
[25:02.07]Better not.
[25:03.94]What do you mean?
[25:04.56]What if I leave?
[25:05.60]Well, then you're going to miss something huge in the next 10 minutes.
[25:09.70]I'm going to play my own Picross game so I don't get the urge to yell at you.
[25:15.23]Yeah, pull it up, man.
[25:16.55]Let's go.
[25:16.91]Alright, let's go down over here.
[25:19.95]So this is part of the five.
[25:20.89]There's a one over here somewhere.
[25:29.35]Four of one.
[25:30.19]One, two, three, four.
[25:31.79]One, two, three, four.
[25:34.31]Eh.
[25:36.17]Two.
[25:36.57]It could be either this way or this way.
[25:38.28]And it could be these two as well.
[25:40.40]This is one of the threes.
[25:44.70]It could be either side because this is part of the three or the four.
[25:47.48]Damn it.
[25:50.44]What about this 8?
[25:51.74]Oh, yeah.
[25:52.58]Yep, yep, yep.
[25:53.04]Wait, wait, wait.
[25:54.28]We made some more room here.
[25:55.44]So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[25:58.08]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[26:01.50]Oh, shit!
[26:08.43]Alright, look at that.
[26:11.43]We shaved off some space here.
[26:14.23]This is the 5.
[26:16.91]And the other 8 as well.
[26:19.81]Can I do that, though?
[26:23.41]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[26:24.73]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[26:26.52]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[26:27.42]I don't have enough info for that, I don't think.
[26:31.72]Can you dismiss us already?
[26:32.88]No, you're stuck here.
[26:35.32]Well, I can do this, though.
[26:36.88]So this is the 3, which means 1, 2, 3 has to be here.
[26:41.44]That's 1, 2, 3.
[26:47.79]one one two three or one two three therefore this has to be one two three one two I don't know the info on that yet never mind I don't have the info the bell rang stay in your seats stay in your seats all of you have detention now every single person in the room in the class has detention all of you
[27:15.86]None of you are going anywhere.
[27:17.30]You all have detention.
[27:22.00]Teacher, I'm hungry.
[27:22.88]No snacks allowed in my classroom either.
[27:29.35]Belle doesn't dismiss us.
[27:30.39]Jerma does.
[27:36.65]I need to go to the bathroom.
[27:38.97]Well, sorry.
[27:39.93]The weird key attached to the giant wooden plank that has the bathroom key on it is out right now.
[27:48.70]You're going to have to wait until Jerry comes back.
[27:55.63]Alright, let me focus.
[27:56.45]This is part of the five.
[28:01.45]I need the top one here.
[28:07.59]I'm gonna beat Jerry up.
[28:09.25]Well, now you're suspended.
[28:10.41]Not only do you have detention, now I'm suspending you.
[28:19.25]Alright, fuck.
[28:19.97]Pay attention.
[28:20.37]It's been a while since I played Picross.
[28:21.55]I gotta get this right.
[28:29.88]3, 2, 3, 5.
[28:31.32]I feel like I can do something here.
[28:34.44]One, two, three.
[28:35.30]Okay.
[28:36.50]I can do that.
[28:37.22]Oh, wait.
[28:37.77]Hold on.
[28:41.15]Yep.
[28:41.59]We can do this, too.
[28:43.07]Yep.
[28:46.69]Alright.
[28:46.97]So, here we go.
[28:48.23]Look at that.
[28:48.87]There's no way it could be eight here.
[28:49.89]There's no way it could be... Yeah.
[28:52.35]Okay.
[28:52.81]So, let's go over here.
[28:53.49]So, we have one, two, three, four.
[28:56.09]One, two, three, four.
[28:57.50]Fuck!
[28:59.02]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[29:01.60]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[29:03.86]There it is.
[29:10.18]There it is.
[29:10.58]Oh.
[29:12.12]There it is.
[29:12.60]Genius.
[29:16.17]The picture sucks.
[29:17.01]Well, you don't even know what it is yet.
[29:18.19]You can't know that yet.
[29:20.73]What does that do here?
[29:21.97]This has to be the three.
[29:24.01]So it needs to be one, two, three, or one, two, three.
[29:28.78]That's the only thing I can deduce from there.
[29:31.46]Now this is part of the four, so one, two, three, four.
[29:35.52]Sorry, it ain't there.
[29:37.38]One, two, three, four.
[29:38.48]One, two, three, four.
[29:39.90]Okay.
[29:44.30]Teacher, I have to go to the bathroom.
[29:46.77]Look.
[29:51.87]You all have to go to the bathroom?
[29:57.37]Everybody has to go to the bathroom?
[30:00.89]Well, I don't know how many stalls and how many urinals are in the bathroom.
[30:03.93]I don't know.
[30:09.80]Jerry's vaping.
[30:10.84]I can see.
[30:11.32]Oh, Jerry's vaping.
[30:12.48]I can see him out the window.
[30:13.60]He's out there like behind one of the trees outside the school vaping.
[30:20.92]Oh, no.
[30:21.20]What's he doing?
[30:21.74]What's he doing?
[30:22.28]Oh, no.
[30:22.62]He's spinning around.
[30:23.48]He's spinning around.
[30:24.12]He's got the wooden key to the bathroom.
[30:26.75]Oh, he just threw it up on the roof.
[30:28.83]You little shit.
[30:30.97]God, he's running.
[30:32.35]He's gone.
[30:32.77]He's taken.
[30:33.15]Somebody's going to call his mom.
[30:34.99]Okay.
[30:38.23]Let me come over here and call the janitor.
[30:40.84]Pick up the phone.
[30:41.50]Pick up the office phone.
[30:44.58]Yeah, we're going to need the janitor to come down here.
[30:46.18]We need another key to the bathroom.
[30:50.40]Jerry.
[30:51.88]He always was making trouble.
[30:54.90]Okay, so where are we?
[30:56.00]Eight.
[30:57.47]Can I do any more here?
[30:58.13]I think, yeah, I can.
[31:03.50]The same exact thing.
[31:06.14]Ooh, I did it!
[31:07.32]That's a three!
[31:07.90]Four, this is part of the five.
[31:13.16]Wiggly, oh my, oh my god, I'm not even paying attention, I'm getting so many subs, what the f- Don't swear, stop swearing.
[31:25.83]Imagine, look, people stream themselves doing all kinds of wild shit.
[31:31.53]Imagine a teacher streaming.
[31:33.71]And like thanking subs in the middle of the class.
[31:38.77]Hey, Nuclear Waffle, thanks for the 25 community subs.
[31:41.32]It Cutesy, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[31:44.34]Lone K, 5 community subs.
[31:47.00]Tank Top Typhoon, 5 community subs.
[31:49.40]AWP, 5 community subs.
[31:51.76]25 community subs from Wiggly Joe, 25.
[31:55.28]Thank you!
[31:58.06]Anyways, Genghis Khan, when he claimed, when he took over China, he was... Sorry guys, I got some subs.
[32:07.61]Give me a minute.
[32:08.87]You would never learn anything in that classroom.
[32:11.73]Nothing.
[32:12.03]It would just be the teacher shouting out subs.
[32:18.34]That was a recycled doctor joke.
[32:20.86]There's a bunch of new people here!
[32:22.10]I can recycle old material like the doctor doing surgery.
[32:32.48]Okay, so the six, the row of six, take a look at this.
[32:34.64]This is really interesting.
[32:35.42]Those of you that don't know how to play this game.
[32:37.32]So I have blocked off places where there's no way it could be six.
[32:42.48]There's not enough space for it, so it has to be down here.
[32:44.38]Therefore, one, two, three, four, five, six.
[32:46.58]You love when that happens, don't you?
[32:48.66]Don't you just love when that happens?
[32:51.47]The row is done here.
[32:53.37]And now we have more info.
[32:54.67]So if you understand this, now this has to be one of the fours.
[32:57.31]Take a look at that.
[32:58.71]Absolutely clean.
[33:00.79]This is the three over here.
[33:01.83]So this has to be part of the five.
[33:03.67]Really cool.
[33:04.67]Really, really cool that we're able to deduce that.
[33:09.19]This is part of the four.
[33:09.95]Therefore, one, two, three, four.
[33:11.95]Can't be over here.
[33:13.47]One, two, three, four.
[33:14.79]Can't be over here.
[33:15.39]What does that do for us here, folks?
[33:17.09]What does that do for us here, class?
[33:21.50]What are you doing?
[33:21.96]What?
[33:24.36]How long does this bit last?
[33:26.06]This is not... There's no bit.
[33:28.84]I'm playing Picross for fun.
[33:32.48]You hate Tetris but love this.
[33:36.41]Yes, because I have more than three seconds to make a decision.
[33:40.37]I can turn away from the computer screen and talk over here about a 12-year-old shot putting a bathroom key onto the roof and I didn't lose the game.
[33:51.54]What are you talking about?
[33:52.13]Alright, so that's done.
[34:00.79]No new info here.
[34:01.77]There probably is.
[34:02.59]No, it's not.
[34:03.22]Oh, it can't be here.
[34:04.26]Look at this.
[34:06.16]Nice.
[34:06.48]Okay, cool, cool.
[34:07.42]Alright, now we got more info.
[34:08.70]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[34:10.82]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[34:12.36]Take a look at that.
[34:13.36]You've got your two.
[34:15.63]Now you've got your two.
[34:18.22]And this is done.
[34:19.64]It has to be here.
[34:20.92]That's not done.
[34:22.22]It doesn't know how to pause Tetris.
[34:27.32]You can pause Tetris?
[34:33.65]1, 2, 3, 4.
[34:34.93]1, 2, 3, 4.
[34:35.81]Okay.
[34:37.85]Can't do anything else here.
[34:38.63]1, 2, 3, 4.
[34:38.71]1, 2, 3, 4.
[34:43.87]That's the 5, right?
[34:45.32]There it is.
[34:45.70]Alright, so now... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[34:49.04]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[34:50.24]Has to be here.
[34:50.98]Or here.
[34:51.96]Does that give us anything?
[34:53.36]There's the 3 right there.
[34:54.34]Bingo.
[34:54.70]Got it.
[34:56.42]This is also part of the 3.
[34:57.68]Can't be here.
[34:59.40]There's your 3.
[35:01.14]Done.
[35:01.68]Got it.
[35:02.28]Oh, speeding up.
[35:03.59]He's speeding up.
[35:04.39]He's getting on the freeway.
[35:05.25]4.
[35:07.51]1, 2, 3, 4.
[35:07.85]Here we go.
[35:08.37]Take a look at that.
[35:12.95]I'm on a roll.
[35:14.61]X more things out.
[35:16.85]Let me see.
[35:17.09]What can I X out?
[35:20.45]Hmm.
[35:21.55]Empty this.
[35:25.61]3, 2, 1.
[35:26.21]This has to be the 2, right?
[35:28.56]Right?
[35:28.90]Yeah.
[35:29.26]Has to be.
[35:30.26]Get rid of that.
[35:30.72]5 and 2.
[35:32.86]This could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, space, 1, 2.
[35:33.96]Can't decide that one yet.
[35:41.58]13.
[35:41.98]1, 2, 3, 4.
[35:42.18]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[35:47.87]13, 13, okay.
[35:50.97]What the fuck is this?
[35:52.73]Is there not a stream game title?
[36:07.67]Why do you have to ask that?
[36:09.90]It's a stream title.
[36:11.96]It says it's Wind Down Andy.
[36:13.90]And then it says Blank PictoPix.
[36:19.58]He's very sassy today.
[36:20.66]No, I'm faux sassy.
[36:23.26]It doesn't mean anything.
[36:25.88]1, 2, 3, 4.
[36:27.70]1, 2, 3, 4.
[36:28.28]Oh, there's your one.
[36:30.64]I love when that happens.
[36:33.30]Joe Biden Raid.
[36:37.51]What the heck?
[36:39.65]Oh my- Oh my God!
[36:41.37]Okay.
[36:48.62]Why do you X?
[36:49.84]I couldn't even read it.
[36:50.54]I don't even know what he said.
[36:54.32]You know what's like funny about doing like the big stream from like four days ago?
[36:59.53]There are people that probably that's the first time they'd watch the stream and they're like, whoa, what the heck?
[37:02.75]That was really, that was really cool.
[37:04.49]I wonder what the next stream is probably going to be something.
[37:07.43]It's Picross.
[37:08.05]I'm just sitting here Picross, like yelling at my students.
[37:11.00]My fake classroom.
[37:15.14]And I'm going to leave for three weeks.
[37:19.52]I got the most follows, I think, in one day, four days ago, and I'll get the most unfollows a week from now when I haven't streamed.
[37:27.48]Whatever, you know, like...
[37:33.58]Oh.
[37:35.84]Have you tried the lasagna?
[37:37.34]It's my favorite.
[37:39.89]Here it is.
[37:40.17]Done.
[37:44.71]13 is done.
[37:45.39]That means I can't do that one.
[37:49.27]Oh.
[37:50.21]1, 2, 3, 4.
[37:50.49]1, 2.
[37:50.91]Block it off.
[37:51.47]Block it off.
[37:52.25]Block it off.
[37:55.12]4.
[37:55.14]1.
[37:55.64]That's done.
[37:56.46]Here's your 4 right here.
[37:57.46]1, 2, 3, 4.
[37:58.28]Can't be here.
[38:06.04]Yeah, like ice cream sundaes, what?
[38:11.52]One, two, three.
[38:12.16]Can I do this one?
[38:14.73]There's three.
[38:15.65]There's three.
[38:16.31]Okay, let's do some cleanup here.
[38:18.25]Oh, I love this game.
[38:20.05]It's the most relaxing and fucking fun thing ever.
[38:24.25]Take out these whole rows.
[38:26.83]I'm going to assume it's probably here, right?
[38:28.87]That would be clean.
[38:29.93]We don't know that yet.
[38:33.01]What even is this picture?
[38:36.10]It's like a swan or something?
[38:38.36]Don't guess.
[38:41.53]Four, four.
[38:42.21]Well, here's the four.
[38:44.83]What even is this thing?
[38:45.65]Three, six.
[38:47.46]Okay, we have our info here.
[38:48.82]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[38:51.88]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[38:58.22]Alright, does that do anything for us?
[39:03.33]That's three and a one.
[39:04.29]We're looking for a two and a one over here.
[39:06.39]What about this five?
[39:08.49]One, two, three, four, five.
[39:09.95]Got that one.
[39:10.49]This is part of the two.
[39:11.49]One, two.
[39:11.97]It has to be one, two here.
[39:13.01]It can't be up here.
[39:13.73]Did that help us do anything else?
[39:18.43]Maybe a little.
[39:20.31]Here's three.
[39:20.81]Could be here, could be here.
[39:23.56]Don't guess.
[39:26.00]Do something funny, sus streamer.
[39:30.92]There's another one done.
[39:33.26]Sus.
[39:37.31]Alright, what else we got?
[39:38.11]That's two.
[39:38.85]Oh, here we go.
[39:40.05]Block that off, because the two's already done.
[39:41.87]There's your six.
[39:42.51]There's your one.
[39:43.27]Done.
[39:44.85]There's your four.
[39:45.85]Done.
[39:46.13]There's your six.
[39:48.39]Okay.
[39:49.05]There's your three.
[39:50.65]One, two, three, four, five.
[39:53.95]One, two, three, four, five.
[39:55.48]It can't be these two.
[39:56.32]It's that one.
[40:00.32]There's your one.
[40:01.40]Now we need a two.
[40:02.40]Gotta be one there.
[40:03.16]Please pee your pants and piss yourself when you beat the level.
[40:19.05]That was a weird...
[40:21.72]Okay, we're almost done.
[40:22.84]I have no idea what this image is, but we're almost done with it.
[40:28.58]1, 2, 3.
[40:28.96]1, 2, 3.
[40:29.41]8.
[40:30.01]Alright, this row's done.
[40:33.19]I didn't even mean to do that, but we did it.
[40:34.31]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[40:37.05]1.
[40:37.33]Nice.
[40:38.43]Okay, that clears out this row.
[40:46.17]There's 4 here.
[40:49.30]Four down here.
[40:50.76]Eight.
[40:51.28]There's one somewhere here.
[40:52.72]One there.
[40:53.20]I don't know.
[40:55.86]Hold on.
[40:56.36]One, two, three, four, five.
[41:01.52]What did that do?
[41:03.90]It gave me something else.
[41:04.72]It's eight.
[41:05.46]Eight, two.
[41:06.18]Bingo.
[41:06.50]There's a two.
[41:07.36]And there's your eight.
[41:09.24]I keep saying there's your.
[41:11.16]Oh, and there's your two.
[41:13.07]There's your eight.
[41:13.63]There it is.
[41:14.19]There we got that.
[41:15.01]There's that one.
[41:15.57]There's your two.
[41:16.11]There's your six.
[41:16.71]There's your five.
[41:18.80]I need something more interesting to say.
[41:20.46]Right?
[41:24.71]Done.
[41:26.01]Or done.
[41:26.49]Done.
[41:28.63]This is done.
[41:29.85]Is that?
[41:30.55]What picture is this?
[41:33.85]What is it?
[41:35.31]It's a squirrel!
[41:36.43]It's a squirrel!
[41:37.49]It's a squirrel with a big tail!
[41:40.25]Oh wow, I thought it was a swan.
[41:45.12]That was cool.
[41:48.98]You know, I did see people say squirrel.
[41:53.10]Blue star.
[41:53.90]Better than one.
[41:57.22]There's your two.
[41:57.76]There's your three.
[41:58.34]There's your four.
[41:59.00]There's your two.
[41:59.64]Alright, what about this one?
[42:08.76]Ooh, alright.
[42:10.30]Ooh!
[42:12.05]That's interesting.
[42:13.35]This one's got some... This is 15. 15.
[42:17.30]Means we can go in here.
[42:18.18]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[42:21.98]3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[42:26.46]Cool.
[42:27.72]So the 9 then is like in here, right?
[42:31.72]That's accurate.
[42:32.28]7 is right in the middle.
[42:34.30]Or maybe not.
[42:34.92]I don't have that info.
[42:40.35]Night, Jerma.
[42:40.79]Enjoy the break.
[42:42.79]Thank you.
[42:43.23]I'm going to try to do as much as I can.
[42:46.60]A lot of stuff going on.
[42:47.69]And I want to make sure I make this clear again because a lot of new people like trickled in from the beginning of the stream about 40 minutes ago.
[42:55.15]Let's make this as short as we can.
[42:57.65]Tons of stuff in the works.
[42:59.25]Stuff I can't talk about.
[43:00.21]I have a lot of major announcements when I come back.
[43:04.04]Leaving to take care of some personal, family, and medical things.
[43:07.84]Once and for all trying to close the book on that medical shit.
[43:10.38]Going to try to get a procedure as fast as I can in this month.
[43:14.33]The reason for that is because there's so much stuff going on in the next six months that I have to get it under control.
[43:22.22]And if I don't, then it's going to be a real pain in the ass for me.
[43:26.70]Well, I'll be back on April 1st.
[43:29.02]And no, that's not a joke.
[43:30.54]I will be streaming on April 1st and April 2nd.
[43:33.68]I will give the announcements on April 2nd because I can't do it on the 1st because then people are going to think it was made up and it was a joke.
[43:40.38]I'll be back on April 1st.
[43:42.76]After today.
[43:44.85]And hopefully by then I would have had a procedure to deal with this costochondritis disk spinal problem.
[43:55.70]We have no idea.
[43:56.70]We're still trying to figure out exactly what that is.
[43:58.18]But at least I can get some injections to stop it from happening.
[44:00.46]Stop the pain from showing itself all the time.
[44:03.77]That's the idea.
[44:07.85]Early April Fool's Picross stream.
[44:09.67]Oh, I hope so.
[44:10.59]Okay, here we go.
[44:12.21]This is part of the four.
[44:13.35]This is part of the two.
[44:14.28]This is part of the four.
[44:15.00]This is part of the eleven.
[44:15.80]This is part of the nine.
[44:16.56]This is part of the... This is part of the... Okay, this is part of the... Let's do it one at a time.
[44:29.69]One, two, three, four.
[44:32.17]This is part of the four.
[44:33.03]Sorry.
[44:36.41]seven one two three four five okay one two three four five six seven that's some new deduction does that give us anything here we've got the one um I don't this might not be part I I don't know if that's part of the one this could be part of the three that could be part of the three the one column what do you mean
[45:10.19]No, the one.
[45:11.25]Middle column one.
[45:14.69]Oh.
[45:18.93]Right.
[45:21.93]Right, I see what you mean.
[45:23.62]I'm shabby.
[45:24.76]I'm so shabby.
[45:31.58]You gonna do health updates on Twitter?
[45:33.42]I will.
[45:34.82]If there is a procedure I'm going to do, I will tell you exactly what it is.
[45:37.84]Exactly what the recovery time will be on it.
[45:40.95]But make no mistake about it, I'm ready to close the fucking book on this.
[45:44.86]It's been like three years.
[45:49.96]And although I was fine after the geode archaeology stream, for like three days plus after that, it was tight.
[46:00.02]It was sore.
[46:01.12]And I'm just like, I have to get more.
[46:04.41]We gotta do something about this now.
[46:10.32]He has big balls.
[46:13.88]Um, I don't know.
[46:16.92]What?
[46:17.18]Just, just, just, just deny that.
[46:19.74]Just say, stop.
[46:20.86]No, why?
[46:21.55]I'm not talking about this.
[46:22.35]What the fuck am I doing?
[46:24.21]Listen, who doesn't, what the fuck's happening?
[46:27.03]Just say, that was weird.
[46:28.19]Don't say that.
[46:28.83]There, there you go.
[46:29.75]That was weird.
[46:30.45]Don't say that.
[46:31.11]Done.
[46:32.61]I'm done.
[46:33.37]Why do I have to reply to that?
[46:35.57]That was weird.
[46:36.21]Don't say that.
[46:36.87]Done.
[46:38.29]Where are we going?
[46:39.89]Here we go.
[46:40.37]This is what I was trying to do before.
[46:41.49]I love this.
[46:51.14]This song is really scary.
[46:53.76]It could be that way or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[46:54.92]Hmm.
[46:55.28]Okay.
[47:00.07]You guys taking guesses of what this is?
[47:01.07]I'm going to say it's a boat.
[47:01.85]I think this is a boat.
[47:05.13]Number the 8.
[47:05.83]Yep, hold on.
[47:06.23]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[47:07.61]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[47:07.87]Hold on a minute.
[47:08.49]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[47:08.89]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[47:10.03]Damn, okay.
[47:10.76]What do we got here?
[47:26.58]It's a toy boat.
[47:27.96]It could be.
[47:29.24]Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
[47:39.85]The music playing in my ear distracted me.
[47:41.97]It's a crab.
[47:42.51]I don't think it's a crab.
[47:43.17]I think it's a boat.
[47:47.56]Three or the eight.
[47:49.02]Probably the eight.
[47:51.48]Because then this would make sense, right?
[47:53.68]Then this would be the four.
[47:55.50]Well, this is a guess.
[47:56.42]I know you're not supposed to do that here, but I'm using enough reasoning to do this.
[48:05.22]I know you're not supposed to do that.
[48:12.48]I did it anyways.
[48:16.16]This song is pretty scary.
[48:20.18]mad it's wrong okay alright we're fine um so this is still eight anymore this is part of the three three well five one two three four five one two three four five I can't do anything else here three four five one two three four five can't do anything with these ones either um what about this row
[48:47.75]I'm going to listen to the Heroes of Might and Magic 3 soundtrack because it's one of the best.
[48:51.45]Oh my god.
[48:51.99]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[48:55.24]Oh, shit.
[48:56.00]This is done.
[48:57.30]Oh, man.
[48:57.80]Nice.
[48:58.10]Okay.
[48:58.74]Maybe it's not a boat.
[49:01.10]It's got a really nice soundtrack.
[49:03.16]And it's one of my favorite old PC games, so that's why it's on here, man.
[49:09.94]Working with uncertain information.
[49:11.40]Yeah, I know.
[49:15.21]What does that do?
[49:16.63]Oh.
[49:18.19]That helps a lot, actually, because now that brings this in.
[49:23.90]I can add to this, can't I?
[49:24.72]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[49:28.80]Okay, I added this, which is part of the 5.
[49:34.74]Very nice.
[49:35.22]Get rid of all this, because there's no 5 there.
[49:37.76]3 can't fit in there.
[49:39.03]A 7 can fit in there, but a 7 can go up this way for sure, and that one is now done.
[49:43.41]That takes care of the 7.
[49:48.65]It sounds like mouth sounds.
[49:53.44]It's really mouth sounds.
[50:00.51]Um, two can't go here.
[50:04.53]Oh, hold on.
[50:06.43]One, two, three, four.
[50:09.49]Alright, what do we got here?
[50:10.43]This is... These could be the... I think these are the two ones.
[50:14.11]Or this could be the two, could it?
[50:15.41]Two, one, one, three.
[50:18.13]This is possible to be the two.
[50:21.44]I don't know that yet.
[50:24.78]Five, one, two, three, four, five.
[50:27.40]One, two, three, four.
[50:37.74]One, two, three, four.
[50:40.69]Nice, okay, this is 1, 2, 3, 4.
[50:42.67]Everything else is done.
[50:48.15]Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[50:50.51]1, 2, 3.
[50:51.51]Uh-oh, this is wrong.
[50:56.00]What happened?
[50:57.10]Oh shit, what happened?
[50:57.82]This is wrong.
[50:59.74]This is wrong.
[51:07.66]Oh, this is all fucked up.
[51:09.80]Is it because I guessed?
[51:11.20]Shit, no.
[51:11.97]Is it?
[51:15.43]Wait, hold on.
[51:16.45]I need to backtrack a little bit.
[51:17.55]What happened here?
[51:25.03]Seven.
[51:26.65]Four.
[51:30.59]Eight.
[51:31.63]Let me get this one.
[51:32.29]Let me get this one.
[51:33.23]So this means... Oh, fuck.
[51:40.55]This row is the problem somehow.
[51:41.78]Or this one.
[51:44.94]This is why you don't guess.
[51:52.53]I can salvage it though.
[51:53.49]Hold on.
[51:56.57]I think this is still correct though.
[51:57.85]It kind of has to be.
[51:58.47]1, 2, 3.
[52:00.15]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[52:08.30]Start over?
[52:08.80]No, what do you mean start over?
[52:10.08]1, 2... 1, 2, 3... Hold on.
[52:14.32]Relax.
[52:14.62]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[52:14.78]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[52:15.06]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[52:15.36]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[52:15.66]Alright.
[52:15.92]5, 1, 3...
[52:35.44]11, 2, 1, 1, 3.
[52:38.58]2, 1, 1, 3.
[52:42.94]It's been 10 minutes.
[52:43.76]You should be done by now.
[52:47.58]You're, you're, whatever.
[52:48.64]You're in detention.
[52:49.78]Or something.
[52:52.56]I don't know.
[52:53.38]2, 3, 4, 5.
[52:53.78]1, 2, 3, 4.
[52:54.72]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[52:55.40]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[52:55.96]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[52:56.52]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[52:57.82]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[53:00.18]Fuck, that's guessing.
[53:04.30]No, no, no, no, no.
[53:04.80]What did I just do?
[53:05.76]One, two.
[53:06.18]Where was it?
[53:06.60]Over here.
[53:08.90]One, two, three, four, five.
[53:10.92]One, two, three, four, five.
[53:13.12]This is right, right?
[53:21.73]Five, one, three.
[53:25.59]That was a guess?
[53:26.21]Column three and four.
[53:27.45]Oh.
[53:34.98]You can eliminate a lot on the second row.
[53:36.50]Yeah, I can.
[53:45.32]That's 8.
[53:46.02]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[53:49.94]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[53:51.94]It has to be there.
[53:55.10]Right?
[53:55.44]And then this is 1, 2, 3.
[53:56.08]1, 2, 3, 4.
[54:02.63]Do we got this right?
[54:03.57]Hey, do we got this?
[54:06.71]There's nine.
[54:07.45]Hey, do we got this?
[54:11.11]Guys, I think we got this.
[54:13.98]None of you are clicking on the screen at all.
[54:15.48]It's me doing this.
[54:17.68]Oh, we're so close.
[54:19.70]It's just me doing this.
[54:27.65]I think I fixed it.
[54:30.89]Okay, this is very right to be wrong.
[54:33.85]I'll be honest with you.
[54:34.65]Fuck!
[54:55.12]Shit.
[54:56.46]One, two, three, four, five?
[55:01.30]Oh no, it's all wrong.
[55:03.30]It's a bunny rabbit though.
[55:04.28]One, two, three, four, five, one.
[55:13.23]Oh shit.
[55:28.92]It's not a bunny.
[55:29.94]Where did this go so wrong?
[55:35.03]It's this junk here in the middle.
[55:37.23]This is correct over here, I think.
[55:59.74]Shit.
[56:08.02]Five.
[56:09.44]One.
[56:09.74]Three.
[56:10.14]Something right here.
[56:11.08]Ah.
[56:14.76]No.
[56:15.99]It's because I guessed on the one educated guess and it fucked up the whole thing.
[56:21.05]Ah.
[56:25.96]I think it's... it's like one column is wrong.
[56:28.94]I can salvage it.
[56:29.70]I know I can.
[56:32.44]Everything needs to be shifted like one square to the right.
[56:38.21]I think this one's wrong.
[56:39.07]Does that be one?
[56:58.72]There's one, okay, one, four, four.
[57:01.04]Hold on.
[57:01.84]Hold on.
[57:02.20]Four.
[57:06.92]Five.
[57:10.22]Oh, I have to fucking restart the whole thing.
[57:12.08]I have to restart.
[57:15.36]I messed, I just fucked something up.
[57:16.94]And when you mess one thing up, the whole project is over.
[57:22.52]Shit.
[57:22.86]I hate it.
[57:25.02]I hate it.
[57:35.31]Alright.
[57:37.88]I still want to do another one.
[57:38.98]I just fucked the whole thing up.
[57:40.44]I fucked everything up.
[57:49.22]What's that?
[57:49.96]Nine.
[57:53.11]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[57:55.89]Alright.
[57:56.55]See, if I was lying in my bed doing this shit, I would just like... I would just go, oops, and restart it like five times.
[58:02.07]Okay.
[58:03.99]Okay.
[58:07.80]Four.
[58:09.78]Eight.
[58:14.28]Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[58:17.80]Okay.
[58:18.98]Relax.
[58:21.27]One, two, three, four, five.
[58:24.37]Two, three, four, five.
[58:26.39]That looks good.
[58:28.43]You cheated.
[58:29.69]Can you explain this more?
[58:31.03]Sure, I actually will.
[58:31.81]Because a lot of people were not here the last time I played this.
[58:35.48]So the whole goal here is to make a picture.
[58:38.40]I'm given some information.
[58:40.22]By the way, this game is way cooler than Sudoku.
[58:43.70]So I'm sorry, but Sudoku is shit in comparison to this.
[58:48.71]But if you've played Sudoku, it's about numbers on the edges that you have to fill squares in.
[58:54.61]This one, you have to make a picture.
[58:56.57]Each one of these rows and columns has this many squares filled in on this space here.
[59:04.25]So in this row, there is five in a row, one, and three in a row.
[59:10.31]In between these three numbers, there has to be one full unoccupied space.
[59:16.55]Has to be.
[59:18.89]And the idea is you have to logically deduce where those squares are filled in based on the knowledge they give you.
[59:26.34]At least one.
[59:27.36]Yes, yes, at least one.
[59:28.88]It could be one, it could be five spaces.
[59:31.16]Has to be at least one space.
[59:35.80]Sudoku is sick as fuck.
[59:37.16]Oh, we have some Sudoku people in here that think that Sudoku is better than Picross.
[59:44.38]Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[59:46.04]Back to the Sunday newspaper, right, Grandpa?
[59:49.06]Hey, how's that latest episode of Foxtrot, Grandpa and the Funnies?
[59:56.69]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...
[60:07.73]I can't do that.
[60:08.41]I can't deduce that.
[60:14.30]That was a really weird laugh, too.
[60:16.20]I'm sorry about that.
[60:18.30]Okay, so no more guessing.
[60:19.96]Get this right.
[60:20.58]Don't be an idiot.
[60:22.52]You're a boomer for even knowing what Foxtrot is.
[60:24.47]Why?
[60:32.85]Why?
[60:37.67]6th column, the 6th column.
[60:41.49]6th column, the 6th column.
[60:43.35]I thought this was, okay, hold on.
[60:50.07]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[60:50.55]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[60:50.83]Very cool.
[60:51.41]Alright, so this is where I got screwed up last time.
[60:55.40]This has to be part of the 5.
[60:56.92]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[60:57.22]Let's just say it's right here.
[60:58.94]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, space 1, space 1, 2, 3.
[61:09.82]This is not part of the three.
[61:10.62]It's part of the five.
[61:11.20]Tell me I'm wrong here.
[61:19.74]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[61:21.87]This has to be the five.
[61:25.53]That's good to know.
[61:27.87]That's not a guess.
[61:29.69]That's not a guess.
[61:34.35]Okay, let's keep going.
[61:36.52]Doing that allows me to go like this.
[61:43.62]1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[61:48.04]That's a correct move, yeah.
[61:49.76]You get 500000?
[61:50.30]I'm not at 500000. It might happen this stream - and if it does oh my god you're gonna hear me celebrate
[62:01.95]You're not doing this fast enough to satisfy my satisfaction.
[62:05.61]Wait, did I read that right?
[62:06.59]Okay.
[62:09.65]Stop.
[62:09.75]Stop.
[62:11.23]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[62:11.37]1, 2.
[62:11.41]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[62:12.09]Correct?
[62:12.39]Correct?
[62:15.58]Correct?
[62:36.31]Alright, I'm slowly deducing.
[62:40.86]Hmm.
[62:44.08]4, 5, 6, 7.
[62:45.34]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[62:47.76]Alright.
[62:49.08]Okay.
[62:50.16]This is where it got messed up last time.
[62:52.26]I'm not at 500,000 yet.
[62:54.26]I have a monitor right here that shows it.
[62:56.82]We're at 499,576.
[62:58.98]I have the live, real-time data.
[63:03.34]You're not.
[63:03.78]No, I'm not.
[63:04.36]Refresh the page.
[63:12.36]I don't have 500,000 followers.
[63:16.42]I have 499,576.
[63:17.84]Debated.
[63:24.56]That's actually really cool.
[63:26.23]Weren't we just talking about how I passed 200,000 like six months ago or something?
[63:30.71]What's happening?
[63:31.25]Alright.
[63:34.43]This is where I got messed up last time.
[63:35.85]I just made it an assumption.
[63:39.39]Two, three, four, five, space, one.
[63:42.69]It's probably right here, right?
[63:44.43]I mean, come on.
[63:51.96]Come on, right?
[63:52.54]It has to be.
[63:55.84]That's a guess, but that is a really good guess.
[63:58.40]That's assuming.
[64:00.31]It has to be there.
[64:02.09]It can't be anything else.
[64:03.93]That's not an assumption.
[64:04.73]That is a deduction from logical reasoning.
[64:10.34]No, that's good.
[64:11.18]It has to be there.
[64:12.48]There's nowhere else it can be True I'm no I can see a real-time Clicker a ticker of how much what I have from subs right now.
[64:31.06]No, I mean for 500,000 subs oh my god
[64:41.57]It rounds up.
[64:42.43]No, I'm at 499,600.
[64:43.09]That would be a billionaire.
[64:50.43]Okay, so that was solved.
[64:52.75]I got that fixed from last time.
[64:54.28]1, 2, 3.
[64:54.34]1, 2, 3.
[64:54.54]There you go.
[64:55.00]Therefore, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[64:56.14]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[64:56.26]I got that done.
[64:56.88]Okay.
[64:57.08]Hmm.
[65:10.39]Is it crack time yet?
[65:11.27]I think it's been crack time since the stream started, like an hour ago.
[65:13.53]Alright, I blew this one too.
[65:17.65]I blew it.
[65:18.07]So now we got four.
[65:20.05]That was the problem.
[65:20.95]I knew it was something right here in the middle that you have to start over so you can see what the hell's going on.
[65:25.12]Very cool.
[65:26.06]Now I got this.
[65:32.14]Okay.
[65:32.74]Now I did this.
[65:34.28]It can't be there.
[65:36.42]Four.
[65:36.70]These are ones.
[65:37.45]They can't be played.
[65:38.09]They can't be done.
[65:41.62]I just lost 100 followers.
[65:46.34]Something you guys don't know, I'll tell you right now.
[65:50.76]There's so many people are coming and going on this stream.
[65:55.44]It's really weird to look at.
[65:58.24]Would you guys like to know how many people unfollowed the stream three days ago?
[66:07.23]Where can I see that info?
[66:08.13]I know I can see it, can't I?
[66:10.98]It was unfollowed.
[66:16.37]I know I can see it.
[66:17.09]I'm unfollowing right now.
[66:25.03]Music is fitting.
[66:26.67]I don't have the data right in front of me.
[66:29.32]Just to let you know, hundreds of people potentially unfollow a day.
[66:33.54]I don't even know who they are.
[66:34.58]I don't know where they came from.
[66:36.20]I have no idea.
[66:39.14]I don't know.
[66:40.34]Hundreds of people follow and hundreds of people unfollow every day.
[66:47.34]It's something like that.
[66:49.72]What's the noise?
[66:51.54]My window's open.
[66:52.16]There's crickets and shit out there.
[66:55.98]And there's also a full band out there, too.
[66:57.84]Pretty nice, though.
[67:01.89]I'm going to keep the window open.
[67:03.39]Alright, let's keep going.
[67:12.01]This is much better.
[67:12.74]Okay.
[67:15.00]Now, no guessing.
[67:19.30]It's definitely not there.
[67:24.45]three can't be there would be here and it could be here four one two three four yeah they're ready you're having one two three four can't be there three four okay one two three four can't be here one two three four can't be there either interesting one two three four one two three four which gave us this which gave us the seven
[67:51.62]Which means we can do 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[67:55.30]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[68:01.91]Okay.
[68:03.11]No guessing.
[68:06.09]It's the audio.
[68:10.77]This is outside.
[68:11.47]Am I playing a math game?
[68:17.72]We can't hear you.
[68:21.87]Alright.
[68:22.15]It's time to OST change it up?
[68:23.91]Sure.
[68:24.13]How about... How about Super Mario World Full OST?
[68:33.25]Okay.
[68:40.92]This is...
[68:43.48]What was I just doing?
[68:44.16]I was right here.
[68:44.58]This is... Okay, three.
[68:45.28]Has to be one here.
[68:46.98]That's that.
[68:47.60]There can't be any more.
[68:49.04]We just got this.
[68:49.76]Nice.
[68:50.18]Good deduction, Jeremy.
[68:51.36]You did a fucking fantastic job.
[68:52.62]People should be so proud of you.
[68:55.26]So this is part of the six?
[68:58.34]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[69:00.46]Done.
[69:01.28]Now, wait.
[69:01.82]Slow down.
[69:04.80]I get DMCA'd from Super Mario music?
[69:07.54]I don't think that's gonna happen.
[69:09.46]Is it like...
[69:10.52]Video game music in a weird area where it's like you're safe from DMCA because it's video game music.
[69:20.92]As long as it's not like a licensed record label song, right?
[69:27.83]What if I was playing Super Mario?
[69:31.85]Yeah, this is fine.
[69:34.47]Look, if I get in trouble for playing Super Mario music on a twitch.tv video game website stream...
[69:41.44]What the hell am I doing?
[69:42.46]What the fuck are we doing here?
[69:44.77]Like, what are we... What's the point of live streaming?
[69:48.13]Like, what... What's the point of streaming video games?
[69:51.41]If we... What?
[69:51.85]If we... Am I gonna have to have a stenographer come in?
[69:56.37]And just, like, give you a live... I'll just, like, tell you what I'm doing?
[69:59.06]Like, I'll just have to... I'll just be, like, on a webcam and, like, I'll tell the stenographer what the fuck I'm doing?
[70:06.98]If I get DMCA'd for Nintendo music on stream...
[70:12.07]And the roller coaster's going down.
[70:13.27]That's all I gotta say.
[70:14.11]Okay, that's... Wait, hold on.
[70:15.21]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[70:15.31]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[70:15.41]Good.
[70:15.59]Alright.
[70:15.81]I think I can do this one now.
[70:18.13]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[70:18.45]Shit.
[70:18.69]What happened?
[70:19.13]What happened?
[70:20.37]What happened?
[70:20.79]What happened?
[70:21.71]What happened?
[70:22.11]Something happened here.
[70:22.89]What happened?
[70:42.94]Oh fuck, something happened.
[70:44.47]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[70:45.37]No, it's okay.
[70:46.87]I'm still good.
[70:50.41]I did not guess.
[70:51.25]That's not what happened.
[70:55.41]We're good.
[70:56.29]I don't know if this is a 1 or a 2.
[70:59.20]This is the 3.
[70:59.88]1, 2, 3.
[71:00.28]Shit.
[71:01.16]Okay, hold on.
[71:01.78]I need something here.
[71:08.64]I'm so nervous now.
[71:09.72]I don't know why.
[71:11.43]Why would I be nervous?
[71:21.51]okay well that's done this is it okay cool what did that do for me two this is maybe the one what did that do here
[71:48.98]Seven.
[71:49.72]Where is it?
[71:50.16]Oh, right.
[71:50.54]You're right.
[71:50.86]Thank you.
[71:56.44]Nice.
[71:58.42]Nine?
[71:59.19]Oh, now I... Okay, hold on.
[72:00.13]I can do this now.
[72:01.99]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[72:04.63]Can't be there.
[72:05.11]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[72:09.57]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[72:13.06]It's a guess.
[72:13.56]Can't do that.
[72:21.01]11.
[72:21.03]11.
[72:27.37]Good.
[72:29.98]I can't do that yet.
[72:30.50]I can't do it.
[72:32.66]I'm too nervous to do that.
[72:33.46]I'm too scared.
[72:34.08]This is a 5.
[72:36.80]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[72:37.22]Can't be here.
[72:37.94]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[72:38.28]Right.
[72:38.62]Right.
[72:46.57]No, that's not accurate.
[72:48.37]One, two, three.
[72:49.21]It has to be one here though, right?
[72:52.15]Three, four, five.
[72:53.15]Not accurate.
[72:55.03]No, it is.
[72:55.39]It's accurate.
[73:02.09]It's a crab?
[73:02.59]I don't think it's a crab.
[73:03.40]You know what?
[73:03.72]It's probably fire.
[73:04.36]Maybe a flame?
[73:09.32]Three and the eight.
[73:10.08]Three and the eight.
[73:13.12]Right.
[73:13.40]Okay.
[73:13.64]So then this is...
[73:19.28]I messed this up last time.
[73:21.94]One, two... This has got to be the eight.
[73:28.22]This has to be like this.
[73:38.81]One, two, three, four, five.
[73:44.05]Is it a bird?
[73:44.64]I think it might be a plane.
[73:49.14]No, of course not.
[73:50.16]It's to see Superman.
[73:54.42]Give me the fucking minus twos.
[73:55.82]Give them to me.
[73:56.94]Give me.
[73:57.91]Give me them.
[73:58.33]I want to see them.
[73:58.99]I want only the chat to be fucking minus twos.
[74:01.23]It's all I want to see.
[74:01.95]I better see it.
[74:02.73]Make me feel fucking horrible.
[74:03.97]Make me.
[74:04.73]I deserve it.
[74:05.25]Okay.
[74:07.61]Is this done?
[74:10.44]There's one.
[74:11.16]Is it the second one or the first one?
[74:16.24]As if this is the second one, then this is the three.
[74:18.02]Okay, I can't.
[74:18.74]Don't guess.
[74:47.03]Come on, I gotta put my, like, singer spin on it.
[74:51.56]Is that row done?
[74:53.06]Is that row done?
[74:57.78]Have we talked about this?
[74:58.96]Anytime somebody does a song that's very... The Mario theme song is very... There's no... It's just... It's like the national anthem.
[75:10.73]But when you get into the singer syndrome, you have to make it your own.
[75:17.59]You have to make it different.
[75:19.33]It can't just be like... No, it's gotta be like...
[75:30.22]You have to do your own, like, wow, I gotta make it different.
[75:36.80]Nobody just, like, sings a song that's a very old, like, song that everybody knows.
[75:40.39]You have to give it your spin.
[75:47.25]True, yeah.
[75:48.51]That's always annoying.
[75:55.14]Well, I mean, I'm just telling you how it is.
[75:58.31]You did the same joke from the Fear 2 stream.
[76:00.79]Alright, well, let's- Hey, how many words have I spoken in the English- Okay, do this for me.
[76:07.47]I want one of you to do this.
[76:08.77]Because we'll see if that's the case.
[76:10.53]I want to know how many words I've spoken on stream.
[76:15.10]I've said every word in the dictionary.
[76:18.88]Like, a hundred times each.
[76:21.68]I've said every fucking possible sentence.
[76:24.04]Like, I've talked-
[76:26.18]50 million words.
[76:28.04]I'm going to backtrack on to one of some of those words sometimes.
[76:31.68]I've said 500 million words on this stream.
[76:37.33]You said that same joke on the Fear 2 stream back in like 2017.
[76:44.67]You're a liar.
[76:45.53]Alright, well this is done.
[76:51.66]So proudly we met.
[76:56.37]Rain fog, Andy.
[77:26.36]Peppa Pig.
[77:27.00]What?
[77:28.42]This is a classic.
[77:31.90]I'm so sorry.
[77:34.53]Hey, remember that, like, how many unfollows am I gonna get in a day?
[77:52.66]Oh...
[77:54.98]My round's done.
[78:01.24]Oh, what is it?
[78:02.12]What's it gonna be?
[78:03.68]It's a bat.
[78:04.74]It's a bat.
[78:07.10]Yeah, this is a bat for sure.
[78:09.77]It's a bat.
[78:11.05]It's a bat!
[78:14.83]Yeah.
[78:18.61]Nero, you're embarrassing me.
[78:21.21]You're getting secondhand embarrassment because I'm annoying.
[78:27.01]Cool, very cool.
[78:27.51]Wait, wait, wait.
[78:32.65]No, I haven't done this one yet.
[78:34.65]I remember this one.
[78:35.33]I love that one.
[78:35.89]Can we listen to Quake 2?
[78:42.41]Um, eh.
[78:45.40]This one's gonna be hard.
[78:46.10]15 by 15.
[78:47.34]7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[78:47.46]So there'll be two spaces.
[78:48.34]Hmm.
[78:57.84]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[79:00.82]I just thought my connector thought was falling down on me.
[79:04.99]I just freaked out.
[79:05.83]This one is hard.
[79:08.93]Yeah, it is.
[79:09.45]6.
[79:09.47]That's 11, 12.
[79:12.07]Yeah, what we could do is... So let's say it was...
[79:23.30]So, two.
[79:23.84]Let's just do this.
[79:25.62]Like, let's just say it was this way.
[79:27.34]Space this way, right?
[79:29.48]That's not accurate, but that will give us some space here to work with.
[79:34.79]So, technically, this can be blocked off like that temporarily.
[79:38.85]I was guessing.
[79:41.23]Yes, I know.
[79:43.53]If I do 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and then 1 space 2...
[79:50.51]We have it.
[79:51.39]This whole quadrant is... Oh, that's guessing.
[79:53.51]I know.
[79:56.26]But technically speaking, I should have this much room.
[79:59.53]At least.
[80:01.20]deduce that.
[80:01.86]Yeah, that's accurate.
[80:03.09]Let me do what I'm doing.
[80:05.21]1, 2, space, 1, space.
[80:08.03]So, like, I have this much room to work with for the 7.
[80:11.05]I was right.
[80:12.13]Thank you.
[80:12.51]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[80:15.41]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[80:17.39]The 7, it has to be like that.
[80:21.53]It's impossible for it not to be.
[80:26.13]Just, just, just, just, just.
[80:30.30]I gotta hurry up.
[80:32.91]Timer's going up.
[80:33.47]Okay, same deal with the other ones.
[80:37.07]So there's another group that's like that, right?
[80:41.32]Six and the five.
[80:42.70]Let's just say it was one, two, three, four, five.
[80:44.76]Space.
[80:45.24]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[80:49.10]That means that I have to... Hmm.
[80:52.00]Song's getting intense.
[80:59.42]Anything from here I can do?
[81:03.56]I was going to do it.
[81:06.06]And now, ladies and gentlemen, here to do for the before the baseball game, the sped up time of hurry up, you've got to get to the end of the Mario level.
[81:16.33]We've got Jeremy Elbertson.
[81:19.96]Hell hey everybody!
[81:21.28]Fucking- BOO!
[81:21.77]BOO!
[81:21.93]BOO!
[81:22.03]BOO like- OW!
[81:22.67]Somebody hit me in the head with a coin!
[81:53.49]Okay, Toy Toy, let's go.
[81:55.91]4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[81:56.59]I don't know what to do.
[82:02.80]Encore.
[82:03.92]Turn on shuffle.
[82:06.36]Why?
[82:06.62]Alright, I need to deduce.
[82:08.52]Stop distracting me.
[82:12.54]I think that's my best bet, I really do.
[82:15.57]1, 2, 3, 4.
[82:16.52]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[82:18.02]Space.
[82:18.32]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[82:18.78]The 6 has got to have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[82:23.40]Right?
[82:26.06]It has to be here somewhere.
[82:30.45]There has to be 3 in a row here.
[82:37.37]I don't... That's tricky.
[82:39.57]That's a guess.
[82:41.50]But it allows me to do this.
[82:49.64]Why are there 12k people watching this?
[82:54.48]Because you got here too late.
[82:58.58]Look, I just... I just like... You should have been here five minutes ago.
[83:04.80]My views have been going crazy.
[83:08.86]If you could see what I did right before you got here.
[83:14.27]I did a handstand.
[83:16.60]I'm so fucking exhausted.
[83:18.52]I did a handstand for an hour And we had a timer that was a one hour handstand like and you fucking missed it I'm like exhausted and I had to sing the national anthem upside down and drink like milk upside down and shit It was a big like follower thing that we did I had 500,000 followers today It's not normally this many but this is usually like maybe like a thousand people here.
[83:39.38]I don't know.
[83:39.64]This is crazy It's a huge increase
[83:43.51]I had to drink milk upside down, and it was like, and it went up my nose and stuff, and everybody's laughing, and the views just kept going.
[83:51.52]I mean, and I was like, I gotta relax.
[83:52.84]That was ridiculous.
[83:54.46]I rode like a horse in here.
[83:56.08]It's like, you don't have no idea what's gonna happen in the next 500,000 follower stream.
[84:02.63]And like, I rode a horse around.
[84:04.17]Yeah, I'm tired.
[84:10.27]I just wanna play fucking Picross.
[84:11.57]I don't, I didn't think there's many people gonna be here.
[84:16.73]Where should I go now?
[84:20.06]It rated like 20 times.
[84:22.82]Yeah, I remember.
[84:23.70]I remember favorite streamer X said, holy shit, this guy's riding around on a horse.
[84:28.18]He just did a handstand and like drank a glass of milk upside down.
[84:31.97]Let's go in there.
[84:32.57]Alright, guys, we're going there.
[84:33.57]They all did it.
[84:38.93]It was weird.
[84:39.55]It's crazy.
[84:40.05]I saw the three row.
[84:45.70]Yep.
[84:50.53]Alright, that helps a lot.
[84:52.31]Even if this is a guess, but I think it's accurate.
[84:55.63]It gives us some more stuff to work with here.
[84:56.94]Okay.
[84:58.70]Anything more than three in a row.
[85:00.62]Damn it.
[85:02.14]Oh, that sucks.
[85:06.58]Called networking.
[85:10.67]Milk keg stand sounds awful.
[85:13.99]Yeah, it does.
[85:19.39]Why would we be doing milk out of a keg?
[85:23.95]It seems really weird.
[85:32.21]That's like a prank.
[85:34.87]Oh man, we got bush light in here.
[85:39.92]Oh, yeah, let's get him up there.
[85:41.12]Yeah.
[85:41.46]Oh, yeah, you want to do it?
[85:42.24]Yeah, I'll do it, Kekstein.
[85:43.12]Let's go.
[85:43.46]Alright, take it off.
[85:44.30]Go ahead.
[85:44.82]Come on in.
[85:45.12]Put it in your mouth.
[85:46.20]Alright, let's tip him upside down.
[85:48.62]So tell him.
[85:51.32]Chug, chug.
[85:54.14]This tastes something about this.
[85:56.75]Oh, yeah, it's milk.
[86:01.87]Freshman drank milk.
[86:03.01]Can I do one?
[86:17.09]Worst character.
[86:20.47]This song.
[86:21.39]And this song is playing.
[86:27.44]Oh, fuck it.
[86:28.30]Fuck this place.
[86:29.10]Drunking milk out of a keg.
[86:49.16]You lost viewers?
[86:50.14]Alright, what do you want me to say?
[86:53.73]What do you want me to do?
[86:54.55]Like, whatever.
[86:55.43]If people are going to leave, they're going to leave.
[86:57.39]Alright?
[86:59.69]You're losing viewers.
[87:00.79]Well, whatever.
[87:02.35]Who cares?
[87:02.95]There's 12... There's like 15 million people live right now.
[87:09.41]If you don't want to listen to the Mario Fast song where they talk about chugging milk out of a keg while I sit here and just don't play the game, then you're gone.
[87:16.27]There's somebody way more interesting you'll find.
[87:19.57]Was that accurate though?
[87:27.03]Alright, I'm done.
[87:29.67]Let me skip ahead.
[87:30.30]I don't want to hear this fucking shit anymore.
[87:36.10]There we go.
[87:36.46]That's better.
[87:38.26]Okay.
[87:40.02]So let's just say that's that.
[87:44.09]Ego.
[87:45.33]I don't have an ego.
[87:50.02]say that anymore.
[87:54.40]I love, um, whatever.
[88:01.51]What the f- Why are they all so fast?
[88:07.29]Go.
[88:07.39]Okay.
[88:20.96]There we go.
[88:23.54]This is scary music.
[88:32.94]Can I do this up here though?
[88:34.22]One, two, three.
[88:35.12]I can't do it up here.
[88:40.94]Where am I going to find the place to start from?
[88:44.17]It's not here.
[88:44.77]I don't know if this is the two or the three.
[88:48.03]I don't know what this could be.
[88:48.81]I don't know what this is either.
[88:53.70]You just did 10 minutes?
[88:54.56]What?
[88:54.66]What did you say?
[88:56.72]Do you remember when you... This isn't PictoPix music.
[88:59.96]This is disarming a bomb music.
[89:03.90]Five, six column.
[89:05.82]I can't do this, though.
[89:06.78]One, two, three, four, five.
[89:08.38]I don't have enough... This is just guessing.
[89:09.90]This is a straight-up guess.
[89:11.19]Irony K?
[89:11.67]Yeah?
[89:12.33]I didn't, did I?
[89:27.30]Oh, nope.
[89:29.00]$499, $789.
[89:29.56]I think I'd rage quit this one.
[89:34.55]I don't like this one.
[89:39.73]Five, six.
[89:42.53]I can't do the five, six.
[89:43.83]How?
[89:48.29]Six.
[89:50.45]could be down I maybe I could just maybe these two in here like it would have to be like one of these two right like it has to be that though it has to be but that doesn't help me at all what about the blue wire I'm going so slow so yeah this is a guess but that doesn't even give me that much info
[90:29.83]I mean technically speaking I could guess and this could be like six could be down here right it could be that and then this could be part of the four one two three four then this is done do not guess don't guess
[90:56.38]Look behind you Seven I can't do anything with the sevens that there's nothing more than a four five six seven eight nine ten Remember you suck at this I
[91:24.52]Okay, we're done with Mario.
[91:26.64]I'm done with this hurry-the-fuck-up music.
[91:30.88]And now, ladies and gentlemen, to sing the Mario Galaxy opening theme song for the entrance of our baseball game, Jerma985.
[91:41.10]He seems to be frozen.
[91:55.48]Clenching the mic very, very tightly in both of his hands with his eyes wide open.
[92:02.88]He's supposed to have been singing by now.
[92:05.04]Somebody get down there.
[92:06.04]Get down there.
[92:06.42]He's frozen.
[92:06.85]He's done.
[92:09.43]He's clenched completely.
[92:10.65]Now he can't do it.
[92:13.31]Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
[92:16.03]jermaOn 8-5.
[92:18.09]Catch him on Twitch.
[92:19.86]Somebody get him the fuck out of here.
[92:21.50]Get him.
[92:21.80]Go get him.
[92:22.14]Just can the music.
[92:26.51]Go to like the, go to the interlude shit.
[92:28.19]Interlude, interlude, interlude.
[92:29.25]Thank you, go, go, go, go, that's fine.
[92:31.86]Go get him.
[92:33.30]He's down there like this.
[92:41.34]Wait, I might be naked in this image.
[92:46.94]Okay, nevermind.
[92:48.90]It's like three guys, like just with one arm on my back, just like moving me and I'm just slowly walking, just clenching the fucking microphone.
[92:57.86]And then it- Oh, what an embarrassing fucking last-ditch effort.
[93:00.93]I start to sing.
[93:01.57]Like, oh, everyone's clapping.
[93:04.85]Oh, he's almost off.
[93:05.69]He's almost off the field.
[93:06.85]Get him off.
[93:10.04]Okay.
[93:15.88]And they cut the mic.
[93:16.58]They, like, pull the cord.
[93:31.60]I'm rage quitting this one.
[93:33.75]I can't do it.
[93:35.95]For me to do these, I need like the one guaranteed space that I know I can do.
[93:39.65]And there's none of them here.
[93:41.47]Fuck.
[93:41.71]2, space, 1, 2, 3, 4, space, space, space.
[93:47.96]There's not enough info here.
[93:51.66]Just guess.
[93:52.08]Try the 5x5 one.
[93:55.61]I have to guess.
[93:57.11]I have to guess.
[94:05.72]I'm guessing.
[94:06.56]Whatever.
[94:06.84]Therefore, this is 2, 2.
[94:11.88]They're all such little numbers.
[94:13.40]Like, what the fuck?
[94:14.28]This one sucks.
[94:17.96]That didn't even help me.
[94:18.76]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[94:25.74]I just have to take a wild guess.
[94:27.20]Whatever.
[94:27.46]So this is 4, maybe the 2...
[94:35.44]Three, vertical four, two, two.
[94:38.54]Four, two, two.
[94:47.32]You sing the DK rap.
[94:48.46]I think I've done that before.
[94:50.52]How many low numbers?
[94:54.66]I don't like, I hate that.
[94:55.40]I don't like having the little, little numbers.
[94:57.50]Four, two, two.
[95:01.42]I don't know if that's accurate up here.
[95:06.05]3 and 3, 1, 2, 3, or 1, 2, 3.
[95:08.17]That's all I can do from that.
[95:11.07]3, row, 3, 3, row, 3, column.
[95:17.87]What?
[95:18.13]What are you saying?
[95:21.09]You can do the horizontal 2, 4, 2.
[95:22.49]Can I?
[95:26.13]Okay, let's just say this is the last 2, which I might not even be.
[95:29.71]It could be that.
[95:32.90]I don't have it.
[95:33.28]I can't do it.
[95:33.78]I don't have enough info.
[95:35.16]Where even is the fucking info?
[95:36.36]There is no info for this.
[95:46.77]Stop guessing.
[95:47.43]I'm trying not to guess.
[95:48.31]Where's the sure thing?
[95:54.32]Where is the sure thing on this list?
[95:56.08]I don't see it.
[95:58.22]422 vertical is a sure thing.
[96:02.30]1, 2, 3, 4.
[96:03.32]1, 2, space 1, 2.
[96:07.53]Vertical 4, 2, 2 is a short thing.
[96:09.23]Where?
[96:09.61]How?
[96:11.45]The 2, 2s could be anywhere.
[96:13.85]They could be here.
[96:14.61]They could be here.
[96:16.59]Here.
[96:16.83]It could be 2, space 2.
[96:18.49]It could be 2, space 2.
[96:19.69]They could be anywhere.
[96:21.66]Fourth row down on that row.
[96:22.98]1, 2, 3, 4.
[96:24.16]1, 2, 3, 4.
[96:31.50]Make progress.
[96:32.00]You can do it.
[96:32.40]I believe in you.
[96:35.22]This is a guess, though.
[96:40.03]I think this one just sucks.
[96:44.57]Look at all these dumb 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2.
[96:45.89]It's like, no, get out of here.
[96:46.89]This one's stupid.
[96:47.69]4.
[96:47.71]Okay, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[97:00.53]Now, does it go this way or this way, the two?
[97:03.13]No idea.
[97:06.77]Vertical seven.
[97:08.89]One, two.
[97:10.07]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[97:13.07]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[97:20.27]Okay.
[97:21.31]This is two, four, two.
[97:22.55]There's the one, one.
[97:24.19]I guessed.
[97:24.91]I took a guess.
[97:25.66]I have no idea if that's accurate or not.
[97:28.68]How am I supposed to know that?
[97:35.34]It's not a guess.
[97:36.64]It is a guess, though.
[97:37.78]I had to deduce that, and I had to make an educated guess to get this even in the first place.
[97:40.98]Okay, hold on.
[97:42.80]How are we doing?
[97:44.04]Now, this is 2, 4.
[97:44.84]There's your 2.
[97:48.42]There's your 4.
[97:50.54]Who knows where the hell the other 2 could be?
[97:51.98]There's your 3.
[97:54.44]That's done.
[97:55.04]Alright.
[97:55.78]These are guesses.
[97:56.68]I don't know how to play the game.
[97:58.18]2, 2.
[97:59.66]Okay.
[98:07.84]It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[98:08.56]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[98:08.98]Should we be dancing?
[98:10.94]Getting there.
[98:11.80]Alright, I need a...
[98:38.19]That's going to help a lot.
[98:40.05]Three, three, one.
[98:41.97]This is probably the three right here.
[98:44.71]Right?
[98:44.91]Because then it'd be two this way.
[98:46.73]Right?
[98:49.19]Yes?
[98:51.34]I think that's correct.
[98:54.04]No.
[98:54.46]What?
[99:02.86]This could be the one.
[99:05.42]I don't know.
[99:08.00]Alright, hold on.
[99:15.23]I really feel like it's right here.
[99:16.39]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[99:17.03]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[99:17.59]This is a 1.
[99:18.13]This is probably the 1.
[99:20.37]Yeah, it has to be.
[99:21.23]3.
[99:21.27]This is a 3 here.
[99:22.35]1, 2, 3.
[99:22.79]Not there.
[99:23.55]1, 2, 3.
[99:39.37]Can't be there.
[99:39.81]Okay.
[99:45.97]I wrote this soundtrack?
[99:47.63]What the... What?
[99:49.05]Dude, did you seriously?
[99:51.45]Are you serious?
[99:53.37]Oh my god.
[99:55.53]Welcome.
[99:56.51]Welcome.
[99:57.11]We need to welcome that person.
[99:58.83]Oh my god.
[99:59.59]Okay, there's another one.
[100:11.81]Okay.
[100:13.27]That does two.
[100:20.91]I feel like these are nothing.
[100:21.97]They have to be over here.
[100:23.15]Otherwise, what the hell is this connected to?
[100:30.75]Four right here, I'm assuming.
[100:35.35]You know where to put the one, do I?
[100:37.03]Okay.
[100:41.21]Yes, I do, don't I?
[100:46.71]Right?
[100:47.04]Like that- that's pretty- that's pretty cl- that's pretty cl- Get close.
[101:02.34]I can't- it could be one, two.
[101:07.42]No evidence.
[101:14.46]The music's making this worse.
[101:20.12]I keep just seeing Mario running.
[101:21.72]Okay, so the ADHD is fucking striking its ugly head here.
[101:25.38]Like, I'm playing this game in front of my screen, but I am seeing in my head Mario running around on planets.
[101:33.46]Like, I'm playing two games at the same time.
[101:38.38]I'm just in that game in my head, just playing it, and while I'm just here now.
[101:45.01]Like, I just collected a coin.
[101:45.95]I just got, like, two coins.
[101:47.09]Oh, yeah.
[101:49.75]Oh, I did the thing where you spin around accidentally because the Wiimote, like, crossed the plane.
[101:54.20]You didn't even mean to do it, but you go, Woo!
[101:56.08]Woo!
[101:56.38]And you get really annoyed by it for a second because you're like, Oh, I didn't fucking want to do that.
[101:59.64]Alright, where are we?
[102:05.44]Here.
[102:06.10]This is 2, 4...
[102:15.45]Seven, one, now where's the one?
[102:17.19]Four, two, oh, okay, hold on.
[102:23.01]Good.
[102:24.07]That's one of the twos.
[102:26.35]This has to be the four.
[102:28.13]Okay, so therefore, one, two, three, four.
[102:30.56]One, two, three, four.
[102:34.08]That's a risky move right there.
[102:37.96]This has to be the only, that's the only one I can put there, right?
[102:39.80]Wait, one, two, shit, it could be here.
[102:43.06]Guess, I know, yeah, I know.
[102:51.48]Stop playing Mario Galaxy.
[102:53.60]Stop playing Mario Galaxy.
[102:54.92]I'm playing Mario Galaxy in my head.
[102:57.64]Shit.
[103:01.92]I just did like a super jump from one gravitational planet to the other gravitational planet.
[103:08.99]It just like pulled me in and I went all the way around the planet and went up and then landed.
[103:13.69]Okay, hold on.
[103:18.37]Let me focus.
[103:23.19]One, two, three.
[103:24.28]One, two, three.
[103:27.06]This is... If this is the other three right here, I know that's a guess, but one, two, three, that means there's the other two, and then I have the four over here.
[103:36.45]I'm just gonna... I'm going for it.
[103:37.59]That's a guess, but I'm going for it.
[103:39.53]I think that's correct.
[103:40.65]Isn't this baseball one down here somewhere?
[103:44.05]That lets me continue.
[103:48.70]So therefore, one, two, three, get rid of that.
[103:51.52]One, two, three.
[103:52.82]That gives me the second two.
[103:54.64]One, two, three, four.
[103:56.18]One, two, three, four.
[103:57.64]One, two, three, four.
[103:59.00]One, two, three, four.
[104:03.43]Now what?
[104:08.09]Oh, shit.
[104:09.07]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[104:16.16]There it is.
[104:16.52]I knew these are going to be closed off.
[104:20.56]1, 2, 3.
[104:21.42]1, 2, 3.
[104:21.84]1, 2, 3.
[104:22.38]1, 2.
[104:22.50]Here it is.
[104:24.42]1, 2, 3, 4.
[104:25.30]Okay.
[104:27.02]Could be either one of those.
[104:29.18]Relax.
[104:31.92]Who's this guy talking?
[104:33.06]Oh, of course.
[104:34.07]It's Drip.85. 3.
[104:49.84]This has to be the three.
[104:53.12]Therefore, that's the three.
[104:55.37]This is the three.
[104:56.81]One, two, three.
[105:01.93]Okay.
[105:03.83]Seven goes down all the way, right?
[105:06.92]Because that would be four to two.
[105:09.24]Wait.
[105:15.88]Hold on.
[105:20.44]Is this the guy that found an ancient treasure on stream?
[105:22.72]I did.
[105:23.10]Oh, this is part of the three.
[105:29.61]One, two, three.
[105:30.17]Shit.
[105:34.79]I can- I know I can deduce this right now, but my brain just can't do it.
[105:37.37]One, two, three, four, five.
[105:40.56]One, two, three, four, five.
[105:41.86]I can't- my brain is just so small.
[105:50.19]No, I have a huge brain.
[105:51.29]It's just... I don't know.
[105:53.09]I feel like I've, like, sucked, like, an intelligence vacuum in the back of my head over the last, like, ten years.
[106:08.28]Three, four, five, six, seven.
[106:15.20]Where could this actually be, though?
[106:20.81]I know I can do this.
[106:21.53]Let me... Alright, quiet.
[106:22.93]Quiet, everybody.
[106:23.43]Quiet.
[106:28.71]Two, two.
[106:31.99]If I do this one here... That would be... This is the second two.
[106:40.68]And that would be the three going this way.
[106:42.08]I think that's correct.
[106:44.88]And then now I've got three...
[106:51.36]Seven is now... Four, five, six, seven.
[106:56.06]Two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[106:59.14]What's this?
[106:59.52]That's a one.
[107:00.14]Two, three.
[107:02.82]Two, space, two.
[107:08.28]Three.
[107:09.08]Okay, hold on.
[107:10.06]That's three there.
[107:13.34]Three, five, seven.
[107:17.76]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[107:20.00]One, no.
[107:27.84]I hope this is correct.
[107:31.83]Now, could this be this way?
[107:34.29]I think that's done.
[107:38.92]Right?
[107:41.52]Oh, I'm just going.
[107:42.54]I'm just going.
[107:43.48]I hope this is correct.
[107:44.80]Three.
[107:47.64]Two.
[107:52.20]Two.
[107:53.70]One.
[107:55.32]Four.
[107:55.74]I need four here.
[107:57.32]One, two, three, four.
[108:02.21]You guys think it's a gun?
[108:03.07]Okay, hold on.
[108:11.21]Second row.
[108:14.68]Three.
[108:17.68]Two.
[108:17.94]One.
[108:21.17]One, two, three, four, five.
[108:27.98]Okay.
[108:29.72]Good.
[108:31.50]There's the three.
[108:32.62]Yes!
[108:35.66]It only took me 30 minutes to get here.
[108:39.61]Now... Here's your one.
[108:45.53]One, two, three.
[108:47.91]One, two, three.
[108:50.59]Okay.
[108:53.09]Now I got a mess over here to deal with.
[109:00.83]Is it a shark?
[109:03.14]Um.
[109:04.08]Yeah, this is a dolphin.
[109:07.66]It's some type of amphibious fish or something.
[109:11.06]One, two, three, four.
[109:12.28]One, two, three, four.
[109:13.90]Okay.
[109:25.29]And thank you Pat Stairsat for the raid.
[109:27.45]Pat Stairsat.
[109:30.17]Welcome, everybody.
[109:31.33]Hope you had a good stream, Pat.
[109:33.91]I'm Dermo.
[109:36.35]Currently doing... What are we doing?
[109:38.41]We're doing Picross with intense music behind it.
[109:42.02]Because that's what we do here.
[109:45.68]Super epic, intense streams.
[109:50.82]X, X, X, X, X. Go to the fucking X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X, X. All gone.
[109:54.30]All of them are gone.
[109:57.77]Alright, where?
[109:58.07]What are we doing?
[109:59.01]Done.
[109:59.21]This one's done.
[109:59.61]Ooh.
[109:59.89]This would be the two, and then here's the three.
[110:08.10]Oh, it's almost done.
[110:08.74]Our dolphin is almost done.
[110:10.00]Our dolphin.
[110:10.68]Mm.
[110:16.13]Mm.
[110:17.89]Mm-hmm.
[110:23.71]Mm-hmm.
[110:25.49]Mm-hmm.
[110:28.00]Uh-oh.
[110:28.22]Uh-oh.
[110:31.70]Something's wrong.
[110:34.26]What went wrong?
[110:36.32]What went wrong?
[110:36.80]What did I do wrong?
[110:37.28]I wasn't paying attention.
[110:39.16]2, 1, 2, 2.
[110:40.18]Oh, this is a... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[110:43.19]Wait, wait, wait.
[110:43.55]Stop.
[110:47.15]1, space 1, space... Why is this 3?
[110:51.43]What happened here?
[110:54.53]How did I... What did I do?
[110:55.66]What happened here?
[111:01.25]One, one, two.
[111:02.09]Two, three, one, two.
[111:03.62]What's wrong?
[111:25.31]What the fuck did I do wrong here?
[111:28.19]You're almost there.
[111:29.69]I just gotta fix this somehow.
[111:32.64]Move four.
[111:34.10]This looks out of place.
[111:37.86]Start over again.
[111:38.90]Oh my god.
[111:39.50]Get out of here.
[111:40.02]Move one.
[111:48.06]Move one.
[111:53.85]create this two one two and one one one two oh goodness this is so much done where is this remove one from one one
[112:21.84]1, 2, 1, 2, 3.
[112:22.54]Okay, hold on.
[112:31.79]It's like done.
[112:33.21]It's the eye?
[112:34.07]Yeah, that's the eye right there.
[112:35.25]But what is this thing?
[112:36.17]That shouldn't be there.
[112:40.81]Alright, turn off the fucking, like, we're about to, like, fly into outer space music.
[112:43.99]I need to concentrate.
[112:45.79]All I can see is me strapped to an astronaut chair.
[112:48.77]Just like...
[112:50.58]Going up into the moon and stuff.
[112:51.92]Get that off.
[112:52.46]I need to pay attention.
[112:53.18]I think it's down here.
[112:56.32]Two.
[113:24.93]Where's the mistake?
[113:27.29]Where's the fucking mistake?
[113:29.27]What is it?
[113:30.35]What is the stupid-ass mistake?
[113:42.82]1, 3.
[113:42.96]This is all fucked up.
[113:45.84]Move vertical 1, 3 down by 1.
[113:46.90]Move vertical 1, 3 down by 1.
[113:54.38]Wait, what?
[113:55.62]Vertical 1, 3.
[114:01.89]What happened?
[114:02.31]Still in the 4.
[114:04.95]This is wrong.
[114:05.61]Oh my god.
[114:06.81]What is the fucking wrong here?
[114:08.35]What is the problem?
[114:09.07]What did I do?
[114:11.19]7 and 1 needs to be over 1.
[114:14.15]Like over here?
[114:14.75]Oh no.
[114:17.70]No!
[114:18.00]No!
[114:32.76]Okay, hold on.
[114:40.78]Go back more?
[114:41.88]No, I don't think so.
[114:42.48]2, 1, 2 is bad.
[114:43.42]2, 1, 2, bad.
[114:43.62]2, 1, 2, bad.
[114:43.84]2 is back here.
[114:45.62]Here?
[114:45.89]And 3...
[115:03.67]Four.
[115:04.73]Done.
[115:05.49]Done.
[115:06.61]Seven.
[115:08.97]Two.
[115:15.03]Two.
[115:18.33]Three.
[115:27.57]One-two oatmeal.
[115:28.69]I don't know what that means.
[115:30.68]1, 1, 2?
[115:33.30]1, 1, 2.
[115:35.23]1, 1, 2.
[115:36.89]But where is the mistake?
[115:39.51]Oh, god damn it!
[115:45.73]1... Does this need to be moved over?
[115:48.13]There's so many X's and shit on the screen, I have no idea what's going on.
[115:56.84]Bottom of 1, 1, 2 is the mistake.
[115:58.74]You have 1...
[116:04.32]2, 1, 1, 1, like here?
[116:05.51]And then, so where the hell does this 2 go?
[116:12.17]1, 1, 2.
[116:22.07]And then one... Oh my god, my... I'm like literally like seeing colors right now.
[116:27.68]It's like everything's just mixing together.
[116:30.72]Three is two.
[116:32.82]One, one, two.
[116:33.38]He's throwing.
[116:37.51]Help me.
[116:37.87]Just help me, please.
[116:40.35]One, three, down one block.
[116:45.99]Um...
[116:51.14]Then where's the one go?
[116:59.45]One.
[116:59.59]This two is done.
[117:03.69]Two, one.
[117:04.37]Two.
[117:07.31]Two.
[117:08.77]Two.
[117:09.09]One.
[117:09.85]Two.
[117:09.95]Two, one.
[117:11.35]Two.
[117:18.66]Oh my God!
[117:20.42]Somebody help me, please!
[117:21.78]Oh!
[117:23.50]Oh, there's one.
[117:47.65]Fucking finally.
[117:48.37]Oh, get out of here.
[117:49.47]Come on.
[117:50.55]Okay, whatever you say, Gwyn.
[117:54.17]This is 15, so 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
[117:54.83]This is interesting.
[117:55.75]3, 2, 2, 3.
[117:55.83]4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
[118:20.11]eight.
[118:21.35]I can, I can do this one.
[118:23.09]Let's just say for instance, this is occupied.
[118:24.69]It's like one, one.
[118:26.49]So let's, I guess what I got to work with.
[118:27.53]So we got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[118:39.86]Cool.
[118:40.62]So what does that do for us here?
[118:42.26]What does that do?
[118:42.96]I'm so, what the hell was I doing?
[118:44.44]I don't know.
[118:44.78]I thought that was going to be funny or something.
[118:47.67]I don't know what that was.
[118:48.35]I thought that was gonna be funny.
[118:49.79]I was like, oh, I'll make like a noise.
[118:51.99]That wasn't even... Why would I do that?
[118:54.98]There's no reason to even do that.
[118:57.76]Oh, this is the song.
[118:58.48]It's the song.
[118:58.92]Oh, let me make like a loud slurp, snort thing.
[119:11.17]I don't know.
[119:11.71]That was not even funny at all.
[119:14.59]Okay, one.
[119:18.32]5, 6, 7, 8, 9 spaces.
[119:20.44]I think I can do this one here.
[119:24.15]5 and 5.
[119:24.81]That'd be... 5 spaces.
[119:27.31]No.
[119:30.73]5 spaces.
[119:31.29]5.
[119:31.79]I don't know if this is the 1 or the 2.
[119:41.85]Did not help me at all.
[119:42.65]Hmm.
[119:44.84]Hmm.
[119:50.27]One, two horizontals can make a lot of X on the right.
[119:58.23]Well, here's the problem, though.
[119:58.93]I don't know if this is the one or the two.
[120:00.23]Because if this is the one, the two could be anywhere over here.
[120:07.85]Hmm.
[120:11.82]I feel like I can get this one somehow.
[120:13.60]Let's see.
[120:14.04]One, two, three.
[120:15.68]One, two.
[120:16.74]Two.
[120:18.48]Three.
[120:25.82]I mean, it's got a... Five lets you place one on each side, does it?
[120:33.58]It's very loud.
[120:34.18]Let me turn that down a little.
[120:37.71]The fives can do one on each side.
[120:39.77]Two, four, five.
[120:49.33]I guess this could be one here and then one here.
[120:51.43]Is that possible?
[120:56.76]One here and one here, right?
[120:57.78]I think that makes sense.
[121:03.45]Oh, shit.
[121:03.87]Nice.
[121:04.17]Okay, hold on.
[121:04.61]1, 2, 1, 2.
[121:05.69]Take a look at this.
[121:07.61]If that's accurate, which it should be.
[121:12.22]Now this helps here.
[121:13.32]Not really, but kind of.
[121:16.54]This doesn't even help at all, actually.
[121:26.35]I don't know if this is the 3 or the 1.
[121:28.10]It's probably the 1.
[121:28.98]Hmm.
[121:33.38]Is it louder?
[121:35.58]Alright, it's a little louder.
[121:38.21]Relax.
[121:38.49]3, 2, 2 is easier now.
[121:41.79]It is.
[121:42.43]You're right.
[121:42.83]1, 2, 3.
[121:43.05]Space.
[121:43.59]1, 2.
[121:43.71]Space.
[121:44.17]1, 2.
[121:44.73]1, 2, 3.
[121:45.17]Oh, it doesn't... Hmm.
[121:55.48]That means it would be, hold on.
[121:57.88]Well, this is blocked off.
[121:58.96]It would be like this then.
[122:02.40]1, 2, 3, space.
[122:05.08]1, 2.
[122:05.74]2.
[122:05.76]1, 2, 3.
[122:05.86]Shit.
[122:07.28]Ah, it's not.
[122:08.04]I can't do it yet though.
[122:11.77]It could be, this whole thing could be moved over one spot.
[122:13.93]You can play some.
[122:21.89]I guess I could.
[122:23.97]Which ones are guaranteed?
[122:28.48]I would probably say that this one's guaranteed.
[122:30.84]That's the only one that I think is guaranteed, right?
[122:36.97]I got 500k?
[122:37.41]Did I?
[122:37.65]499.98.
[122:39.67]No, we're not there.
[122:41.15]Oh, no.
[122:41.59]That's 500,000.
[122:41.87]Holy shit.
[122:42.21]Cool.
[122:45.40]500,000 followers on Twitch.
[122:46.08]Wow.
[122:46.24]Thanks, guys.
[122:46.62]It's been a lot of fun.
[123:00.05]Cool.
[123:01.11]500k.
[123:03.19]Speech?
[123:05.15]Um... Rub-a-dub-dub!
[123:07.37]Thanks for the grub!
[123:08.95]Why, you little... Oh, so this one is accurate, right?
[123:23.82]Because if it's 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, these two can be placed?
[123:28.96]I can't do these ones, though.
[123:32.78]What the fuck?
[123:33.30]I'm unfollowing.
[123:33.96]What are you talking about?
[123:40.76]So that helps a lot.
[123:42.14]Wow, that helps a lot.
[123:48.84]Alright, so... This changes everything here.
[123:53.30]Because I might be able to actually do this now.
[123:54.70]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, space, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[124:00.85]Most of these can be filled in.
[124:06.37]At least a lot of them can.
[124:07.37]Which then, 1, 2, 3, divide this whole row.
[124:12.61]Wait.
[124:14.19]Can I fill this in?
[124:16.11]Wait, what happened?
[124:16.79]Hold on, why did I just do that?
[124:19.27]1, 2, 1, 2, 3, okay.
[124:19.81]Oh wait, I'm freaking out.
[124:21.69]I've heard a K song?
[124:23.91]Omega Lull under 500k.
[124:30.23]Well, it's not these ones.
[124:32.29]Not these ones.
[124:37.21]Is that incorrect?
[124:38.55]Wrong, wrong.
[124:39.35]This is wrong, right?
[124:44.29]This is 1, 2, 3.
[124:45.57]I can block that off.
[124:48.23]This is probably the 3.
[124:49.75]That's probably the 3.
[124:51.05]1, 2.
[124:51.51]Block this off.
[124:57.88]Alright.
[124:58.20]5-5 is wrong.
[124:58.58]1, 2... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[124:58.74]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[124:58.84]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[124:58.94]Would it be this?
[124:59.32]It was right.
[124:59.60]No, I think it... 1, 2... 1, 2... 4, 5.
[125:00.42]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[125:33.05]No, that's right.
[125:33.63]Oh my god, is this a Nancy Drew game?
[125:41.69]Yep.
[125:44.51]That's not right.
[125:45.25]Are you sure?
[125:45.73]I think that's correct.
[125:50.08]Because then that gets rid of that.
[125:56.08]It is right.
[125:56.48]Yeah, that's correct.
[125:57.44]So then I have to just worry about the 8 here.
[126:01.54]Three.
[126:02.20]Can't be that way.
[126:02.75]So one, two, three.
[126:04.07]It's close.
[126:04.63]I can't do it yet though.
[126:08.85]Oh, fuck.
[126:09.15]What do I do?
[126:09.67]Three, three.
[126:15.31]No two here yet.
[126:20.19]Four, four, three.
[126:20.99]You filthy animal.
[126:22.16]Oh my God.
[126:25.60]It could be one, two, three, four.
[126:26.72]One, two, three, four.
[126:29.86]One, two, three.
[126:39.78]I can't do it.
[126:40.46]Three, two row can have stuff blocked.
[126:46.60]You messing with me?
[126:47.42]Are you messing with me?
[126:53.15]Okay.
[126:57.35]Alright, so this would be the three.
[127:00.01]One, two, three.
[127:01.85]One, two, three.
[127:03.09]Can't beat any of these, so it has to be here.
[127:05.07]Are you messing with me?
[127:09.79]That's done.
[127:10.37]What about here now?
[127:13.12]So this is definitely the two and the twosome.
[127:15.18]Oh fuck, this is wrong.
[127:22.30]So it was wrong.
[127:38.34]The 5 was right.
[127:39.16]3-2 is the bad one.
[127:40.46]Well, what the?
[127:41.86]This one here?
[127:42.46]3-2 wrong, not 5.
[127:43.20]Oh, this one's wrong.
[127:43.88]What?
[127:44.04]What else does this logically go?
[127:46.06]The X's you put on 3-2 are wrong.
[127:47.60]Blue?
[127:47.96]Blue?
[128:07.59]If this is 2, then... This can't exist here.
[128:11.62]Remove the 2.
[128:13.70]Shit.
[128:21.28]So if this is... Nothing over here can be used.
[128:25.71]This is correct, right?
[128:26.59]If this is correct, then I can't do anything up there.
[128:32.19]Same with this one.
[128:39.80]And this one.
[128:42.24]And this one.
[128:43.74]Okay, so how... What the hell?
[128:46.45]It has to be... Is this the 2 then?
[128:49.45]This must be the 2.
[128:50.51]Maybe not.
[128:51.23]It could be 1, 2, 3.
[128:52.87]This could be 3, 2.
[128:54.27]Hold on.
[129:01.80]What does that do for me over here?
[129:06.32]It's mate.
[129:06.68]4, 4, 3.
[129:10.26]I can't do the 4, 4, 3 yet.
[129:11.22]Let's see.
[129:13.85]1, 2, 3, 4.
[129:14.15]1, 2, 3.
[129:14.65]Let's see what it looks like.
[129:19.29]I can't do that yet.
[129:20.23]Oh my god.
[129:22.74]Relax.
[129:25.74]Third row from the bottom.
[129:26.50]Fifth from the left.
[129:30.50]You just gave me directions.
[129:33.43]Wait, wait, wait.
[129:33.85]This is 3, 5.
[129:38.67]I mean, this 1, 2, 3 space... Alright, the 3 has to be here.
[129:41.93]There's your 2.
[129:42.21]There's that.
[129:42.79]There's 3.
[129:43.91]Cap that.
[129:45.77]There's the 1.
[129:46.35]1, 2, 3, 4.
[129:47.09]1, 2, 3, 4.
[129:47.17]There's 3.
[129:47.83]Close that off.
[129:49.21]That's the 1.
[129:49.67]This is the 2.
[129:52.05]So 1, 2, nothing over here.
[129:55.17]1, 2 could be over that way.
[130:09.64]There's the two.
[130:10.50]The first one, of course.
[130:11.88]There's the four.
[130:12.82]This row's done.
[130:14.42]This gives you the three, which completes the two.
[130:17.22]Complete that three.
[130:19.28]What do we have here?
[130:20.01]That's the one.
[130:25.39]What about here?
[130:28.09]One, five.
[130:28.89]There's a two over here, which has to be one of these.
[130:31.57]That's your three.
[130:32.35]Block that off.
[130:33.49]Okay.
[130:37.68]This has to be four.
[130:41.03]That's done.
[130:41.49]There's two.
[130:43.51]Two, two.
[130:45.10]Three.
[130:45.56]Ooh, this is getting exciting.
[130:48.66]Three.
[130:49.84]Walk it off.
[130:50.48]Killed this whole thing.
[130:54.54]Four, four, three.
[130:56.26]Oh, that was so satisfying.
[130:58.22]I love that.
[130:59.86]Three.
[131:00.16]We need two and then two somewhere over here.
[131:08.07]Here's the real question, though.
[131:09.59]This can't be three.
[131:11.86]This has to be the three.
[131:12.92]One, two, three.
[131:13.96]Oh, I don't know that yet.
[131:14.76]Hold on.
[131:18.38]Okay, good.
[131:20.52]Can any of these be brought from the bottom?
[131:26.01]This is the one.
[131:27.29]Yep, it is.
[131:30.05]Also a one.
[131:31.15]Here's the eight.
[131:32.35]Cool.
[131:33.61]Can't be a two here.
[131:42.87]I'm not doing that.
[131:43.43]People are gonna actually think that's fucking annoying.
[131:45.61]Like, I would.
[131:46.17]I would.
[131:47.75]If it were me in the chat room right now, I would be like, that's annoying, and like, just stop doing it.
[131:51.21]It's not funny.
[131:52.55]That would, like, annoy me.
[131:53.45]That would be actually annoying.
[131:58.83]There's one.
[132:04.53]There's also one.
[132:05.51]Alright, now it's all coming together.
[132:09.13]Can't be here.
[132:09.61]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[132:10.45]There's the 3.
[132:14.27]When it all starts coming together, I love it.
[132:17.83]It looks so wonderful.
[132:20.11]There's your... 2.
[132:21.34]Wait.
[132:21.64]Don't get too crazy about this.
[132:24.22]That's 1, 1, 2.
[132:24.60]There's your last 2.
[132:25.22]What even is this thing?
[132:39.51]I have no idea what this is.
[132:41.07]What is this?
[132:42.89]What is it?
[132:47.81]Flame?
[132:48.16]Oh, it's a campfire.
[132:50.00]Nice.
[132:53.78]It's peanut butter jelly time.
[132:55.16]That actually did kind of look like that.
[132:56.56]Nice.
[132:57.76]Okay, is there any more that I didn't do back here?
[133:00.32]I did them all back here, right?
[133:05.83]Nice.
[133:06.27]Look at how many I've done.
[133:08.84]Well, here we go.
[133:09.46]There's still more to do.
[133:12.74]I kind of want to do a huge one.
[133:15.94]Where's the first 20?
[133:16.54]Okay, this is 20 by 20.
[133:17.86]This is going to be a mess, by the way.
[133:20.37]Good luck.
[133:20.59]This actually is good.
[133:23.57]This is 16.
[133:23.75]1, 2, 3, 4.
[133:23.83]Technically, 1, 2, 3, 4, right?
[133:32.89]Does Nate have four on either side?
[133:34.07]Alright.
[133:35.05]Oh, it happened.
[133:37.20]It actually happened.
[133:38.22]This is the equivalent of getting, in breakout, the ball stuck on top in like the first or second shot of the game.
[133:47.14]You'll see what I mean in a second.
[134:00.83]Ugh.
[134:02.91]Nice.
[134:03.41]Okay.
[134:07.08]Ooh, 15, 16, 7.
[134:07.26]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[134:07.88]Okay.
[134:08.08]So this is connected here because it's 1 by 15.
[134:09.52]That's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[134:10.00]Space 1.
[134:11.06]Well, could this be the 1?
[134:11.66]And we go wham.
[134:12.00]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
[134:12.42]Nope.
[134:12.64]It has to be connected.
[134:15.38]This is done.
[134:16.10]Already.
[134:16.54]Holy shit, cool.
[134:37.47]Anything else already done?
[134:38.27]This is done.
[134:41.07]This looks like some kind of... Is it like a box?
[134:45.59]Four can't be in the middle there.
[134:48.77]It's a snail.
[134:49.69]Yeah, it's probably going to be a snail.
[134:51.35]Okay, seven.
[134:55.83]I think it's in the middle.
[134:57.74]Is it?
[134:58.00]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[135:05.60]Okay.
[135:07.74]Two or two, don't know yet.
[135:11.60]It is a snail.
[135:12.24]Yeah, this is going to be a snail.
[135:14.25]One.
[135:15.79]Two, two, one.
[135:17.11]A cat?
[135:21.05]Will it be like a cat head?
[135:22.01]No, it's not a cat.
[135:22.91]This is four.
[135:27.29]Two, don't have the info for that.
[135:29.98]Two could be in there.

[140:00.10]You're right.
[140:00.36]Okay.
[140:07.38]Oh my god, I have to do the top now.
[140:08.68]Alright, I'm getting overwhelmed if I don't stop.

[140:55.81]Alright, this is done.
[140:57.05]All the way up.
[140:59.37]This one is done there.
[141:00.47]1, 1, 1.
[141:00.63]1, 1, 1, 1, 1. 1.
[141:07.80]Oh, that's four.
[141:10.02]Four.
[141:10.60]Ball row.
[141:14.68]Nice.
[141:15.97]Oh god, this is the most boring game to watch, Jerma, please.
[141:24.54]Oh god, watch one of the other 700 million streams.
[141:40.00]Just change the look.
[141:41.61]An infomercial is on right now on this channel.
[141:45.03]Just like... You can flip around.
[141:47.29]Is this a QR code?
[141:54.97]I don't know.
[141:58.37]Yo, it's a QR code.
[141:59.81]Yo, this is fun.
[142:08.55]I'm having fun.
[142:15.22]Can I go this way?
[142:17.78]Picross is like one of my favorite video games ever made.
[142:19.58]It's right next to Diablo II.
[142:22.56]If this shit was on that 100 best games of all time list, it would have been number three.
[142:32.03]One.
[142:34.33]One.
[142:34.57]Maybe ten.
[142:35.03]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[142:36.19]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[142:39.71]One, two, three, four, five.
[142:42.12]It's all in here.
[142:48.22]He loves Picross, but he hates Tetris.
[142:50.10]Yeah, because Tetris is stupid.
[143:01.83]Fuck you.
[143:13.68]I don't like Tetris.
[143:18.19]Is that illegal to say?
[143:20.59]I don't like Tetris.
[143:22.25]I don't like Tetris.
[143:23.19]It's going to be the four.
[143:27.78]No.
[143:28.14]Yeah, it could be.
[143:31.08]That is illegal.
[143:32.20]Alright.
[143:32.54]Hold on.
[143:32.78]Almost done.
[143:34.76]One, two, three, four.
[143:35.92]So it can't be this one.
[143:36.99]Alright.
[143:40.55]There's so many ones and fours.
[143:42.23]I'm going to lose track here.
[143:45.63]One, one, next thing is two fours in a row.
[143:48.61]Is this a maze?
[143:51.25]I don't know.
[143:54.44]Well, there's another one here, another one here, and then a seven.
[143:59.78]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[144:03.08]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[144:08.71]Right?
[144:11.41]The seven has to be in the middle here.
[144:17.06]I do not like Tetris.
[144:24.08]Tetris is fun to watch somebody that knows what they're doing, but not for me to play it.
[144:28.02]You said you loved Tetris in an Overwatch stream like four years ago.
[144:37.57]I'm making it up.
[144:38.37]I don't know.
[144:39.59]Show me the clip.
[144:41.91]You show me the clip of me talking about how much I love Tetris.
[144:46.14]You tell me.
[144:48.41]to see it one four one one there's another one here find it find it any of the fours here this is one four four one seven one four
[145:13.92]Let's just say it's here.
[145:14.60]That means it would be 1, 2, 3, 4.
[145:18.34]So we can deduce that.
[145:26.51]Do I read chat?
[145:28.31]How would I come up with all the things you guys are saying?
[145:30.39]How would I come up with all the things you guys are saying?
[145:33.67]Okay, that hit a 7, right?
[145:37.13]Nope, that's a 1.
[145:37.55]1, 1, 7.
[145:37.71]1, shit, okay.
[145:50.58]False comments.
[146:01.13]Hmm.
[146:05.27]I Tetris.
[146:07.21]No, I get too frustrated when I play Tetris.
[146:10.33]I can't do it.
[146:11.62]I get oh mega frustrated.
[146:17.42]Okay, one, seven.
[146:20.56]This is going to get harder.
[146:28.88]Ten.
[146:30.30]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[146:34.76]There's another one here, so let's just say it's here.
[146:36.60]That means, let's just say one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[146:46.35]That do anything for me?
[146:48.95]It does.
[146:49.85]It actually does a lot.
[146:50.61]I hope it's right.
[146:51.89]Okay.
[146:56.95]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[146:59.15]How you guys doing?
[147:01.39]I didn't ask that, did I?
[147:06.35]Did I ask that?
[147:06.87]Did I ask how you guys are doing today?
[147:09.13]I should have.
[147:10.19]How are you?
[147:13.41]How are things?
[147:16.87]You got a test tomorrow?
[147:19.32]Shit.
[147:20.68]Shit.
[147:20.92]It's alright.
[147:22.18]You'll do fine.
[147:23.71]Remember, don't worry.
[147:24.91]As long as you get a C plus to a B minus, it's fine.
[147:28.77]Don't let anybody tell you differently.
[147:29.75]Alright, we got seven here.
[147:38.30]There's one here.
[147:40.30]Skip this one.
[147:40.94]We're going to have to start here.
[147:42.96]Let's see.
[147:45.26]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[147:47.13]No, it's still the same.
[147:52.29]Okay, Xbox, turn off.
[147:53.51]I'm going kind of sad because I don't like school.
[148:01.55]Neither did I. Neither did I. I actually really didn't like school.
[148:06.80]I thought it was boring and annoying and it pissed me off.
[148:11.78]But I did it.
[148:12.96]I got through it.
[148:13.50]As long as you do enough.
[148:21.45]I think we put too much pressure on kids to do really well in school.
[148:27.01]We teach them stuff that they have to memorize.
[148:29.13]And then we base how smart they are based on how much they remembered.
[148:33.46]Which I think that's not the correct way to do things.
[148:40.84]But, you know.
[148:44.74]I'm looking for the one that's over here.
[148:52.97]This is almost done.
[148:53.51]Here we go.
[148:57.19]1, 1, 4.
[148:57.60]This is the 4.
[148:59.68]1, 2, 3, 4.
[149:01.16]1, 2, 3, 4.
[149:05.74]I think that's correct.
[149:07.67]This just has to be the 7.
[149:09.97]Oh god, this is a guess, but I'm taking an educated guess here.
[149:14.93]This is a guess, but whatever.
[149:22.27]guessing Gary I think that's right but uh people learn so differently I honestly I think our like our entire education system has been
[149:47.24]still doing the same things that they did back in, like, the 40s.
[149:51.92]Like, there's so much shit that we need to know.
[149:53.36]That we need to learn.
[149:55.06]That are important.
[149:58.04]Like, why are we still treating school like it's 19, like, fucking 20?
[150:00.54]I don't understand.
[150:02.46]I don't know why.
[150:03.95]We literally have cars that are gonna fucking start driving on their own.
[150:07.55]But we're still using the same, like, educational system from, like, the fucking 30s.
[150:10.53]Why?
[150:15.21]I don't know.
[150:20.78]seven oh I was I thought you guys okay I thought you guys were saying 7-eleven like 7-eleven like go to 7-eleven I thought it was like a weird stream joke thing you guys are doing seven seven okay hold on oh right here like go to 7-eleven 7-eleven get like a slurpee I don't know I thought you guys were making a weird joke
[150:50.29]Oh wow, that changed everything.
[150:57.16]Oh shit, OK, this is almost done.
[151:05.32]Like hungry, hungry hippos.
[151:07.86]Actually not a bad idea.
[151:08.70]1, 1.
[151:15.03]It's done.
[151:16.91]What the hell are we looking at here?
[151:20.44]You know what I mean?
[151:20.86]Like, what is this?
[151:22.50]Four?
[151:25.86]Four?
[151:28.58]Some kind of maze?
[151:34.24]Hold on.
[151:35.28]Go back.
[151:35.56]I think I just didn't want to do that.
[151:37.20]Hold on.
[151:39.41]Four.
[151:43.71]What is this?
[151:50.43]labyrinth that's kind of dull a labyrinth oh this one looks cool this is 20 by 20 oh no it's an FTK maze this is the whole thing
[152:21.31]Any other big ones?
[152:21.89]7 would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[152:26.13]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[152:30.53]I mean, I know I can't deduce that, but I don't care.
[152:31.98]I'm keeping it there.
[152:32.76]N, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[152:34.08]Ah, new OST.
[152:34.42]What, um... What about Hearthstone?
[152:59.12]No, no, no.
[153:00.86]Hearthstone!
[153:01.58]Fine, how about The Sims 1?
[153:07.63]I think that's pretty good.
[153:11.61]I'll be playing this when I get back.
[153:13.41]I'm going to do a Sims 1 stream.
[153:17.23]Multiple streams, probably.
[153:23.00]Okay, well, very obviously this is connected together.
[153:26.04]There's no way it's not.
[153:31.68]8, 9, 10, 11.
[153:32.52]That would be, let's just say, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[153:36.47]Space 1, 2.
[153:37.03]Or we could do 1, 2, space.
[153:39.31]So that would be... Right there.
[153:41.69]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[153:42.97]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[153:43.39]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[153:45.59]8.
[153:45.61]Alright, that looks pretty good to me.
[154:02.29]14 would be... How much on each side would be like this, right?
[154:09.13]1, 2, 4, 5, 6.
[154:11.29]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[154:12.93]Yay.
[154:14.36]Yay.
[154:15.78]Gabby J. Yay.
[154:17.90]Yay.
[154:18.28]I have an actual curiosity for you guys.
[154:25.18]How many times...
[154:27.49]Over the last like five years on Twitch, have I done the super punch out Gabby J guy?
[154:34.51]It's probably like five to ten times.
[154:37.21]I've done it a lot.
[154:38.45]It's been at least three to five times.
[154:39.73]At least probably ten.
[154:40.43]I don't know why it just pops in and just does it.
[154:42.83]Okay, seven.
[154:45.32]There it is.
[154:49.66]I didn't do it yesterday.
[154:50.68]I didn't stream yesterday.
[154:52.22]What are you talking about?
[154:54.42]He did it yesterday.
[154:57.82]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[154:58.50]1, 2, 3, 4.
[155:03.16]He did it yesterday.
[155:07.64]6, 7.
[155:09.58]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[155:11.14]Alright, getting there.
[155:20.21]Revoice Andy.
[155:22.11]Ow.
[155:24.11]How did you just hurt me?
[155:30.17]Well, this is interesting.
[155:31.39]Is this the 2 or the 7?
[155:32.25]Probably the 2.
[155:35.59]Wait.
[155:36.15]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[155:36.89]Can't be down here.
[155:39.49]That's the 7.
[155:39.83]Well, then none of these can be correct.
[155:47.03]Cool.
[155:48.53]That shaves that down.
[155:52.64]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, space, 1, 2.
[155:55.94]Alright, so let's just say there's 1, 2.
[155:57.24]I'm just saying.
[156:00.46]That doesn't mean it's... I just scratched you in the eye.
[156:08.69]Very cool.
[156:15.55]Um... Might be there.
[156:19.97]Interesting.
[156:22.01]Interesting.
[156:22.65]One, two, three.
[156:23.49]This whole row is done.
[156:24.55]Except for this one.
[156:28.83]It's probably the chew.
[156:29.71]Hmm.
[156:33.60]And here.
[156:34.12]One, two, three.
[156:35.84]Ooh, this is wrong.
[156:37.02]This is ugly.
[156:38.48]What happened here?
[156:38.98]Okay.
[156:45.09]I think I just solved this.
[156:57.32]Which means this is three and this is three.
[157:00.48]One, two, three.
[157:01.52]Kill that.
[157:03.08]One, two, three.
[157:03.96]Kill that.
[157:09.15]I'd like to solve six.
[157:14.39]Six.
[157:15.15]Okay.
[157:15.79]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[157:17.76]Get out of here.
[157:18.88]Get out of here.
[157:20.66]This one's cool.
[157:21.14]I like this one.
[157:21.56]This one's nice.
[157:28.96]I like to spin, please.
[157:31.00]Oh, right.
[157:31.30]That's from the Wheel of Fortune game.
[157:32.56]Is it a goose?
[157:35.98]I don't know.
[157:41.54]Well, one... This is completely toast down here.
[157:44.44]Two, three, four.
[157:49.44]Nice.
[157:50.64]Very nice.
[157:54.73]Very nice.
[157:55.59]Wait, don't assume.
[157:58.89]And one.
[157:59.47]This all goes away.
[158:00.49]One, two, three, four.
[158:02.85]Block those.
[158:05.72]Can't be there.
[158:06.16]Can't be there.
[158:06.64]Hmm.
[158:10.38]How does he read messages the moment they come out?
[158:14.08]Hmm.
[158:17.09]It's the Five Nights at Freddy's guy.
[158:18.45]I don't know if this is the four or the three.
[158:29.71]It's probably the four.
[158:31.37]Okay.
[158:34.17]So that means this whole thing is done.
[158:36.20]Which means this is done too.
[158:37.80]And so is this.
[158:39.58]Is it a flamingo?
[158:40.50]It's probably a flamingo.
[158:47.17]I think it's a flamingo.
[158:55.35]Three.
[158:56.57]Okay, right there.
[159:00.42]And this is a three.
[159:01.36]One, two, three.
[159:04.02]Eight.
[159:05.06]Two and eight.
[159:07.01]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[159:10.17]This is going to be one.
[159:16.36]Hello, everyone.
[159:16.84]How's the stream been?
[159:17.64]It's been really comfy and just cozy and hanging out.
[159:21.36]By the way, reiteration Andy, because I don't know how many people have come and gone.
[159:27.94]We'll just give the quick TL;DR again.
[159:31.41]TL;DR, I just pressed F4.
[159:32.65]Hopefully, it didn't do anything weird.
[159:33.91]Okay.
[159:36.09]So, I am not going to be streaming for three weeks.
[159:39.42]I'll be back on April 1st.
[159:41.36]There's a ton of projects, huge announcements to make.
[159:44.20]Some very exciting stuff a lot of you guys are probably going to really, really be into.
[159:47.66]So, keep on the lookout there.
[159:50.16]TL;DR, I need to get my medical shit solved and treated.
[159:54.39]I need to get a treatment and a procedure for it because it's like six huge fucking projects.
[159:58.97]That if I don't get it solved, then it's going to be horrible to deal with.
[160:04.12]So I have to get on top of this before we do any of these major, major projects.
[160:09.33]Among some other personal things.
[160:11.19]So, there you are.
[160:14.95]Gotta get on top of this, because I can't let it just sit around.
[160:17.61]I can't keep just like, well, I don't... I did all this stuff six, seven months ago, eight, like a year ago, and I... There's nothing really... There's nothing really horribly wrong with me, but there's something wrong with me that needs to be treated.
[160:29.87]So, there you go.
[160:33.16]I have to get on it, because it's starting to cause problems again.
[160:39.94]Two, one, two...
[160:45.30]There we go.
[160:48.98]That's the one.
[160:49.58]Daisy three.
[160:50.54]One, two, three.
[160:51.20]Alright.
[160:52.74]That's done.
[160:58.93]What about over here?
[161:02.13]One, two.
[161:03.83]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[161:06.07]I can't do it yet.
[161:10.17]I remember this song.
[161:17.15]This is the four... I don't know.
[161:19.79]Alright, hold on.
[161:20.23]Close my one eye.
[161:22.31]Oh, what the hell am I doing?
[161:29.03]Yeah, all this is nothing.
[161:30.46]All this is nothing too.
[161:31.30]Okay, does that help me?
[161:39.18]Four... One... One, two, three.
[161:43.00]Okay, well that's done.
[161:50.39]1, 2, 3, somewhere over there.
[161:51.83]12.
[161:54.35]1, 2, oatmeal.
[161:54.91]I think that's right.
[162:05.18]1, 3, 4.
[162:13.04]There's got to be a 3 in here.
[162:18.75]way this way two one two oh shit that's it that's two one two one so now that therefore this has to be connected here it's a two oh no that didn't do anything it's a flamingo
[162:45.23]One, three, four.
[162:47.91]There's nothing here.
[162:50.19]One, three.
[162:50.94]Definitely not here.
[162:51.60]Okay.
[162:53.86]One, two, three.
[162:55.18]One, two, three.
[162:56.16]Third row here.
[162:59.50]Okay, good.
[163:02.78]That, and then here's number four.
[163:05.18]Two, two, two.
[163:07.21]Why does it have a weird, like, puzzler?
[163:13.03]What's it called?
[163:18.44]Four, three, four.
[163:19.34]Is that the three or the four?
[163:22.46]I don't know.
[163:29.35]Four, five.
[163:35.41]Three.
[163:37.43]Five.
[163:38.99]Three.
[163:40.33]Here.
[163:43.15]Is it a swan or a stand?
[163:44.49]It could be like a staff.
[163:45.43]I don't know.
[163:46.15]It could be something weird.
[163:51.27]1, 3, 4.
[163:55.67]Crane?
[163:56.35]Yeah.
[163:59.19]2, 2.

[164:23.38]That can be deduced.
[164:24.06]4, 3, 4.
[164:32.22]The leg's kind of bent.
[164:36.68]Did I do it right?
[164:40.68]I think that's good.
[164:41.80]That looks a little weird.
[164:46.82]I think that's correct.

[165:37.50]I'm very curious about something.
[165:39.09]See, this is what I did.
[165:39.89]So these are all from the workshop and they're hidden.
[165:45.89]What are these?
[165:46.27]Because they're hidden.
[165:51.82]Okay.
[165:54.95]I'm kind of afraid.
[165:55.71]Uh, so this says 78.
[165:57.13]This is 30 by 30.
[165:58.33]Like, I'm gonna play it, I guess.
[166:06.56]Oh my god.
[166:08.19]This is so much.
[166:09.69]30 by 30?
[166:20.18]Ah, so if it's 20, that means it can- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[166:22.35]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[166:22.81]These are guaranteed.
[166:24.27]23, 24- Oh, hold on.
[166:24.83]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[166:25.03]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

[167:00.05]This is the final boss.
[167:01.09]22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.
[167:01.61]I can get a lot of these right here.
[167:02.69]22.
[167:02.71]Hold on.
[167:02.97]Let's see.
[167:03.25]1, 2, space.
[167:03.41]1, 2, space.
[167:03.57]22 now.
[167:16.71]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.
[167:25.52]Okay, so we go like this.
[167:26.56]It has to be there.
[167:31.02]Somewhere in there.
[167:31.48]Now check this out.
[167:33.32]We get a lot of info here.
[167:43.73]Oh, come on.
[167:44.57]Give me more data.
[167:46.70]Give me some more data.
[167:47.80]20.
[167:47.82]Is that 20?
[167:48.98]I don't know.
[167:53.45]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
[167:54.51]Cool.
[167:54.65]15 now.
[167:54.79]So down to here.
[167:56.87]15, 14.
[168:18.77]13 11 Okay, and that's all the data that I have right now It's gonna be the J we'll find out alright 22 now and
[168:43.91]So we can go, let's count to 22 minus 8 on either side.
[168:47.83]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[168:50.25]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[168:53.69]Here we go.
[169:02.91]I'm very curious of what this actually is.
[169:04.31]21, holy shit.
[169:06.41]What are the arrows on the top left for?
[169:10.79]I think just zoom in.
[169:15.04]21.
[169:15.06]Okay, this is all the way across.
[169:17.32]21, though.
[169:19.20]Let's see.
[169:19.62]5, 10, 15.
[169:19.72]1, 5, 10, 15.
[169:19.82]20, 21.
[169:19.86]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[169:20.00]I mean, that's... I can do that.
[169:20.82]6.
[169:20.84]5.
[169:20.86]Again.
[169:21.16]5 again. 4.
[169:46.69]Cool.
[169:47.99]Seven.
[169:50.35]Seven.
[169:50.63]Eight.
[169:52.19]The hell is it?
[169:55.22]What is this?
[169:56.22]Is it just nothing?
[169:57.32]No, it has to be something.
[169:58.62]It's not just nothing.
[170:06.02]Well, here's the five.
[170:06.90]And then this is the six.
[170:09.82]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[170:14.12]Nine.
[170:21.05]Alright, what else can I do up top?
[170:24.63]Let's add these together.
[170:25.33]6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
[170:25.51]That would be 21.
[170:25.93]Cross.
[170:26.15]It's 16.
[170:26.27]So let's go like this.
[170:27.01]Do space.
[170:27.23]Now that's 27.
[170:27.94]So if it's 27, we need 16.
[170:29.56]So 27. 27.
[170:50.03]was, what am I doing?
[170:50.83]Right.
[170:51.05]Stop 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.
[170:57.03]So how many, it's 10, 11 spaces on either side.
[171:00.98]Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.
[171:22.25]17 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 1 2 3 4 5 6 This is a pain in the ass 5 10 15 16
[171:52.72]5, 10, 9, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[171:56.46]Okay.
[171:56.84]One that's 22, right? 22.
[172:08.96]That would be 20, so one space would be 28.
[172:12.30]So we need to count, um, we need to count 28 minus, we need to count six spaces on each side.
[172:21.88]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[172:22.98]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[172:23.14]Okay.
[172:23.32]Did that do anything for me?
[172:39.12]Well, this is definitely part of his 13.
[172:40.44]1, 2, 3, so that would be 4.
[172:43.81]That's... I have 6.
[172:47.29]13 here.
[172:47.99]Is that 13 the whole way across?
[172:49.01]7, 8, 9, 10.
[172:52.45]Okay.
[172:52.81]Done.
[172:52.95]21, 7.
[172:53.05]I can't do that here.
[173:04.34]uh this one could be done that's that's 21 22 23 not yet 3 21 22 yeah we can connect this which would be one that's five that's four god damn it little green lines I'm

[173:42.83]Okay.
[173:50.27]It's a Terraria screen.
[173:51.39]I don't know what it is.
[173:57.53]22 across.
[174:03.92]Why are these here?
[174:06.60]Why are these here?
[174:07.40]Why do they put these here?
[174:09.63]These don't belong here.
[174:11.17]Right?
[174:11.87]No, they don't.
[174:12.23]Across to your past self.
[174:18.57]Well, 19.
[174:18.99]Let's connect.
[174:19.85]18.
[174:19.87]Maybe not.
[174:24.85]This is 8.
[174:26.35]Now it's actually just 8 across.
[174:31.77]Which makes this 6. 6.
[174:41.31]going to be among us?
[174:42.19]I don't have any.
[174:43.21]I don't think that's what this is.
[174:45.97]Any of the huge numbers I didn't do yet?
[174:47.21]Twenty and three.
[174:58.26]They sell candles that smell like you.

[175:15.65]21.
[175:15.75]What was it?

[175:48.87]Good.
[175:50.15]This is 3.
[175:51.35]15.
[175:53.73]That's done.
[175:55.57]And that's done.
[175:55.97]The whole thing's done.

[176:09.42]I feel like I can do this one.
[176:10.32]26, 1.
[176:10.36]So it's 26, 27, and 28.
[176:10.76]So let's go down here.
[176:17.20]with the space so that would be I need to count backwards if we're at 28 so two so one two and then the rest of these can be filled in one two fill in the rest okay get rid of these I invested my life savings in bald coin currently filing for bankruptcy um
[176:49.29]Okay.
[176:50.49]Seven.
[176:51.15]And then this is nine?

[178:22.31]That means 30.
[178:22.63]29, 28, 27.
[178:23.61]So count 11 spaces.
[178:24.47]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

[180:49.45]9, 9, 4.
[180:49.77]5, 11, 5.
[180:49.91]2, 3, 4, 5.
[180:52.05]Definitely connected there.
[180:53.81]What the hell even is this?
[180:55.83]6, 14...
[181:25.85]I feel like I'm missing a bunch down here.
[181:27.15]18.
[181:27.17]Let's do this one.
[181:31.89]18 and 1.
[181:32.84]Let's see.
[181:33.16]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.
[181:33.76]Haha.
[181:33.86]It has to be there.
[181:34.74]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[181:35.30]So that has to be blocked.
[181:53.35]Also 7.
[181:54.39]That's already blocked.
[181:55.17]Also 6.
[181:57.33]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[181:57.99]Okay, that's fine.
[181:58.91]This is also 6.
[182:00.43]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[182:00.75]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[182:01.99]5, 5, and 10.
[182:02.49]Pot of coffee?
[182:03.39]Okay, hold on.
[182:05.13]This one here seems like it could be done.
[182:23.65]twelve seven in a row eight nine ten eleven twelve three four five six seven god damn it you need to start pretending
[182:53.42]I don't think so.
[182:57.88]I'm overwhelming myself.
[183:01.02]This is 17 right here.
[183:01.90]Look it.
[183:02.06]17.
[183:02.08]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
[183:02.98]Shit.
[183:03.08]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9...
[183:21.71]I think that's it.
[183:25.38]I think so.
[183:28.00]Then it's like 2.
[183:28.78]Yeah, that's right.
[183:34.76]8.
[183:34.78]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[183:36.75]1, 2, 3.
[183:39.51]Okay.
[183:41.75]Alright, getting there.
[183:45.01]You can't assume the bottom 2.
[183:46.67]I can assume.
[183:49.88]Yes, I can.
[183:56.34]6, 12, 11.
[183:58.54]This is broken up here.
[184:01.86]Let's just assume that this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, right?
[184:04.36]Right?
[184:04.52]Let's assume that.
[184:05.68]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[184:11.41]No, don't assume that.
[184:11.93]We have to assume it.
[184:26.38]4 and 2 is in here.
[184:27.06]Wait a minute.
[184:27.78]1, 2, 3, 4, space 2.
[184:35.23]I think this is going to be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 1, 2, 3, 4, space 1, 2.
[184:39.31]Fuck.
[184:43.27]This is so much better than Buy Mode 1.
[184:50.03]This is a great song.
[184:56.46]Did we do this?
[184:57.04]Is this done?
[184:58.28]Let's see.
[184:59.14]5, 10, 15, 20.
[185:01.26]22.
[185:01.32]No.
[185:01.68]It's 21.
[185:02.20]We can either go up or down.
[185:05.51]I don't know why this is freaking me out so much.
[185:14.75]I think this is connected.
[185:18.33]Yeah, this has to be connected.
[185:22.04]Yeah.
[185:24.20]This is part of the 14th.
[185:32.92]12, 6.
[185:33.18]This is part of the 12.
[185:34.40]Alright, what about up top here?
[185:37.17]12, 10, 2.
[185:37.33]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[185:39.05]Here we go.
[185:41.09]Is this 12 right here?
[185:41.73]4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[185:43.57]Nice.
[185:43.81]This is part of the 10.
[185:44.69]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[185:45.81]Alright, I can't deduce that yet.
[185:48.23]Is this your face?
[186:01.01]It could be.
[186:01.51]I don't know.
[186:11.35]Is it the chin?
[186:12.67]Is it the thing face?
[186:13.67]It could be either one of those.
[186:16.40]Alright.
[186:16.90]What about this one?
[186:17.44]13, 4, 2.
[186:17.50]13, 4.
[186:17.54]Uh-oh.
[186:17.78]No, wait.
[186:18.16]That's one.
[186:18.62]Okay.
[186:18.74]Okay.
[186:26.80]this could be the two or the four it's probably the four one two three five ten eleven twelve thirteen well let's deduce it and eleven twelve thirteen one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen
[186:58.75]I'm going to assume this is the four.
[187:00.85]I don't think that's the two.
[187:10.72]All we have left is fours and threes.
[187:13.46]So this has to be connected.
[187:14.58]This could be this way first.
[187:19.39]So this is good.
[187:21.33]It's not singles.
[187:22.39]It has to be connected.
[187:24.15]Not singles.
[187:24.97]Wait.
[187:25.81]Hold on.
[187:26.19]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[187:26.93]I don't know that.
[187:27.39]That's not for sure.
[187:33.25]2, 13.
[187:33.83]Can't be any of these.
[187:38.82]Oh shit, there we go.
[187:39.34]13.
[187:39.36]There's your 3.
[187:41.22]Okay.
[187:41.32]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[187:41.52]Definitely not that way.
[187:45.90]We got 16, 2.
[187:46.44]There's, I got one here.
[188:02.11]And then four.
[188:03.19]One, two, three, four.
[188:04.63]It has to be one of these two, right?
[188:06.95]Is it the goblin face?
[188:14.21]It could be anything.
[188:21.94]This is part of the three.
[188:22.78]19, 22, 26.
[188:22.84]One.
[188:23.18]No.
[188:33.57]I love this song.
[188:34.09]This one's awesome.
[188:40.50]Piss?
[188:41.66]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[188:42.14]I'm gonna go piss.
[188:44.84]Be right back.
[188:45.22]Go pee.
[188:46.55]See you in a minute.
[189:20.48]I don't know.
[189:22.34]I don't know.
[189:58.66]you
[190:55.99]I swear to God.
[190:57.73]I swear to God.
[190:58.57]Oh, it's an animation.
[190:59.27]That's cool.
[191:01.77]There's no escape from you guys.
[191:11.32]That was terrifying.
[191:16.26]Very, very cool.
[191:18.00]Let's head back to it.
[191:18.70]That's so cute.
[191:28.44]So, uh, what I was going to say is, I swear to God, when I drink water, you know when you fill up like a Brita filter, and it takes maybe 5 to 10 minutes, maybe 15 minutes, but when you pour it at the top, it filters the water down at the bottom?
[191:45.13]I swear to God, that's what my body does.
[191:47.79]I drink a water, and my inner Brita filter just does it, just takes out all the impurities, and I piss it out within 10 minutes.
[191:56.67]Why do I pee?
[191:57.21]I have to pee so much.
[191:58.61]Why do I pee all the time?
[191:59.63]Why am I constantly peeing?
[192:00.77]Like, I think I process urine faster than a Brita filter does.
[192:12.96]Anyways.
[192:13.28]You need to replace your filters.
[192:20.21]It's your kidneys.
[192:20.69]Kidneys.
[192:22.05]I've had my kidneys checked.
[192:24.33]I've had my kidneys ultrasound.
[192:26.17]I've had blood work for my kidneys.
[192:27.43]There's nothing wrong with them.
[192:28.23]They're like perfect.
[192:29.70]But how?
[192:30.40]They're not.
[192:30.92]They need to be more efficient.
[192:33.56]Are they too efficient?
[192:39.44]Alright.
[192:39.64]Anyways, where are we?
[192:44.84]Your kidneys are fucking jacked.
[192:49.61]Alright, here's the three.
[192:50.54]Close that up.
[192:56.28]Over-efficient kidneys.
[192:57.68]We have some info here.
[192:58.60]Three.
[193:03.04]Nine.
[193:03.48]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[193:07.71]I can't do it.
[193:09.57]You're pregnant.
[193:21.38]Oh shit, hold on.
[193:24.48]Is this the 8 or the 7?
[193:25.58]This is probably the 7.
[193:26.02]7.
[193:26.18]None.
[193:31.08]And then we have 8.
[193:32.90]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[193:33.50]We got... How many spaces do we have?
[193:35.12]5, 10, 11.
[193:35.18]9, 8.
[193:35.22]That.
[193:35.50]Perfect.
[193:35.76]So that's 1.
[193:37.17]We got a 1 and a 3.
[193:37.81]1 and a 2. 2.
[193:50.99]One and a two.
[193:51.55]One and a two.
[193:55.14]One and a two.
[193:56.04]Oh!
[193:57.90]Okay.
[193:58.20]This is a six.
[194:03.86]Oh!
[194:05.80]Two.
[194:07.50]And a two.
[194:08.76]One, two.
[194:13.05]Yeah, it's definitely the thing face.
[194:14.93]It for sure is.
[194:18.75]Alright, so what about this?
[194:20.25]This is 7.
[194:25.67]And the 2 is somewhere over here.
[194:26.77]Hmm.
[194:32.98]Is 12 fit here now?
[194:38.46]Cannot deduce it, so we have to go like this.
[194:42.08]3.
[194:44.16]Alright.
[194:44.84]And then 6, which is done already.
[194:48.34]What's left up here?
[194:49.00]Just a couple of wands?
[194:52.66]Yeah, this is custom made.
[194:53.97]This is not a workshop.
[194:54.63]10.
[195:03.31]1, 2.
[195:06.73]This is part of the 2.
[195:10.13]Therefore, this is part of the 10.
[195:11.09]That's 12.
[195:13.16]Yeah, okay.
[195:17.35]3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[195:18.71]Okay.
[195:22.21]Wait.
[195:27.13]I can't be there.
[195:27.65]3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[195:32.47]Can't be there either.
[195:35.27]Wrong?
[195:35.55]No, it's not.
[195:38.63]It's the dump truck.
[195:39.45]No, it's definitely the thing face.
[195:42.59]It's a baby elephant sitting on his hind legs.
[195:48.91]That's an amazing imagination you have.
[195:54.09]Okay, cool.
[195:55.57]It's like looking at a cloud.
[195:56.63]Everybody sees something different.
[196:03.07]19.
[196:03.11]Well, it's obviously not down there.
[196:11.14]It's a baby dragon.
[196:13.32]Oh, I could probably, I could see that.
[196:15.06]Wow.
[196:23.54]Well, this has to be the six because there's no way it has to be filled in.
[196:27.07]What is this one?
[196:28.29]Wait, one.
[196:29.29]What did I do?
[196:30.91]One, two, six.
[196:39.11]Two.
[196:43.06]Six.
[196:43.58]Wait, where am I?
[196:44.46]One, two, six.
[196:51.03]2, 11.
[196:53.51]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[196:54.95]Oh god, this is wrong.
[196:56.09]What happened?
[196:56.52]This is so many numbers.
[197:01.60]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[197:02.22]No, back up, back up, back up.
[197:03.06]What did I take away?
[197:09.68]Okay.
[197:14.23]Oh my god.
[197:14.99]I need to like zoom in.
[197:17.15]Jesus, this is painful.
[197:19.89]two six two no that's correct okay what and then two right here and then eleven three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven ten four two um okay there's a four in here
[197:56.29]Anything else I can do in here in the meantime?
[197:58.94]3, 9.
[197:59.12]Okay, that's done.
[198:02.74]This is 14, 3.
[198:04.72]And a bunch of other stuff.
[198:06.58]This is 15, 4.
[198:09.55]A bunch of other stuff.
[198:10.31]23.
[198:10.33]1.
[198:10.35]1, 17, 2.
[198:11.63]1, 16, 1.
[198:11.79]Oh yeah, this is together.
[198:14.03]Hold on.
[198:15.13]1, 2, 3, 4.
[198:28.21]13, 14, 15.
[198:28.31]So it can't be down here, right?
[198:35.19]15, 16.
[198:37.38]So it can't be either one of these.
[198:49.32]That would be 14 this way.
[198:50.83]Is that correct?
[198:51.63]11, 12, 13, 14.
[198:54.41]Hell yeah.
[198:55.17]Yeah.
[198:58.21]It was done.
[199:00.11]12.
[199:00.31]This is nine.
[199:06.79]56789.
[199:09.84]And this one is sorry, hold on, slow down.
[199:18.82]Who?
[199:19.04]812678 re
[199:30.51]Two.
[199:32.23]Three.
[199:33.71]Three.
[199:34.15]Alright.
[199:35.87]Eight.
[199:38.61]Twelve.
[199:41.91]Two.
[199:44.49]We're getting there.
[199:45.11]Almost.
[199:45.41]It is that face.
[199:56.64]This is two.
[199:58.44]Be that way and then it would be
[200:01.41]1, 2, 3, 4... Gemma, can you help me with my homework?
[200:06.37]Yeah, I said multiple choice.
[200:08.85]Question 1 through 10.
[200:10.73]A, C, B, A, C, A, A, A, B, D, A, D, B, A, B, D, C, A, C, D, B. Done.
[200:27.25]A, C, D, C...
[200:30.74]That was more than 10?
[200:31.38]Oops, that was like 12, whatever.
[200:44.49]Who has multiple choice for homework?
[200:50.47]That would be so awesome!
[200:52.38]Oh my god, that would be incredible, wouldn't it?
[200:55.72]You don't have to get it right, you just have to hand it in.
[200:58.71]Can you imagine being in homeroom and just writing like B-A-B-B-B-D-C-A-B-B-D-B-B.
[201:06.54]Done.
[201:06.90]Hand it in.
[201:07.26]Does everybody have their homework?
[201:10.90]Yeah, I do.
[201:11.64]Here it is.
[201:11.96]Oh, okay.
[201:14.50]Thank you.
[201:15.02]Check for the day of bringing your homework in.
[201:18.98]Do the bottom row.
[201:22.95]Two.
[201:24.25]Two.
[201:26.11]And one, two, three.
[201:34.18]No, I can't do the bottom row.
[201:35.44]Why did you lie to me?
[201:47.01]Bottom left.
[201:47.55]Oh.
[201:47.61]5, 10, 15, 20, 21, 22.
[201:48.59]Alright, give me your best...
[202:06.88]Mine was better.
[202:07.34]Alright, 15.
[202:10.34]5, 10, 15.
[202:10.46]12.
[202:10.52]10.
[202:10.56]Done.
[202:10.72]9, 3, 1.
[202:12.10]This is 11.
[202:12.48]2.
[202:12.50]That one's done.
[202:36.95]16 this way.
[202:37.49]Done.
[202:41.11]2, that's done.
[202:43.19]Okay.
[202:44.47]Nice.
[202:44.79]Uh-oh.
[202:58.86]Oh, shit.
[202:59.20]What happened here?
[203:09.83]What happened down here?
[203:20.81]22.
[203:20.83]16.2 is busted, is it?
[203:30.59]Bottom right should not have X's.
[203:39.61]Is this 22, though?
[203:40.27]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
[203:54.31]No, that was wrong, too, because it could know it was right.
[204:03.07]Then there's a 2 in here.
[204:08.99]Um.
[204:13.32]There's nothing here.
[204:16.34]Or here.
[204:16.60]It can't be.
[204:18.64]Fuck.
[204:31.61]16 to the right one?
[204:32.29]16 to the right one.
[204:33.59]When are you going to play The Sims 1?
[204:41.19]When I get back, that's the first thing we'll do.
[204:44.84]I'm really looking forward to playing it.
[204:49.44]This is a pretty lackluster 500k stream.
[204:52.02]I didn't even know I was at 500,000 followers.
[204:55.46]You told me that an hour ago.
[204:57.50]I didn't really have time to prepare a 500,000 follower stream.
[205:04.46]The archaeology stream was for 500,000 followers.
[205:05.82]There you go.
[205:10.00]This is wrong somehow down here.
[205:16.17]I don't know what the problem is.
[205:17.71]19.
[205:24.93]Can't be any of these.
[205:26.91]That's three.
[205:29.29]Hmm.

[206:52.11]7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14... Which... 14... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... 14, 15, 16... Shit!

[207:25.14]Bottom right, 2.
[207:29.56]But... This is fucked up, though.

[207:51.20]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.
[207:52.85]2.
[207:52.87]That's over.

[212:52.90]22, 1.

[213:06.89]Where else would that 1 go?
[213:07.69]Done.
[213:15.25]Here's the... With 3 and then 20.
[213:24.85]That's done.
[213:27.37]Nice.
[213:31.49]Why highlight your message when the word toilet will catch his eye?
[213:35.49]That's a really good point.
[213:45.45]18 none of these make any sense I really love Jerma streams toilet put community Jake on I want to talk to him well that's too bad what do you want to talk to him about huh what do you want to talk to him about
[214:15.06]Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet. Toy boat. Toilet. Toilet. Toy boat. Toilet.
[214:24.37]Would you let me just finish this and stop distracting me.
[214:25.75]5, 10, 2.

[215:12.23]That's not Trump.
[215:13.97]Why is that Trump?

[215:18.97]What are you talking about?
[215:44.07]eight six one two three four five six one two nine seven that's a four this is a uh two two six three six
[216:14.33]Show us the real Trump voice.
[216:16.13]Okay.
[216:24.03]Any other questions, please?
[216:28.17]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[216:39.63]Nine, nine.
[216:48.07]Four!
[216:52.47]This is politics.
[217:00.16]That's my favorite cupcake flavor, toilet.
[217:12.81]Uh, it's probably... I'm less of a cupcake guy and more of a muffin guy.
[217:19.03]I think muffins are better cupcakes.
[217:25.06]Especially when they're really dense.
[217:28.96]I like a nice dense blueberry muffin.
[217:33.11]I want more wet, less dry.
[217:35.11]I don't like a dry cake, like cupcake.
[217:37.97]It's got to be moist.
[217:39.57]So this is how I give you my determination for what that would mean by this.
[217:43.84]If you take a muffin and you squish a piece of it between your fingers, if it sticks together and acts like a snowball, like it squishes together and is wet, like slightly damp, that's how you know you've got a great muffin.
[217:56.83]Like slightly moist.
[218:01.43]Blueberry moist dense muffin or chocolate chip.
[218:05.83]Or coffee cake.
[218:07.31]A coffee cake muffin.
[218:09.29]Cupcakes are, I think, they're junk.
[218:11.18]I do.
[218:11.38]Because all you do is you just bite the top off and you don't even eat the rest of it.
[218:18.12]The actual cake part of a cupcake is a part that I don't like to eat.
[218:23.36]Might as well just take a spoonful of frosting out of the container.
[218:26.48]That's what I want.
[218:30.03]Alright, let's connect this.
[218:30.85]This is five here.
[218:32.28]One, two, three, four, five.
[218:34.14]I can't finish that one yet.
[218:46.38]I don't know where these go.
[218:47.32]Alright, there's my, I need four here.
[218:50.38]One, two, three, four.
[218:51.82]One, two, three, four.

[219:27.46]Yeah, it is actually.
[219:28.34]It's really good.
[219:28.98]It's almost done.
[219:34.36]Go over to this other side here.
[219:36.80]Anything be completed here?
[219:40.48]Five.

[219:47.05]Okay, these can be filled in.
[219:49.85]Oh, this is the best song in the whole album.
[219:52.55]I love this one.
[219:53.61]It's fantastic.
[220:01.42]I need to pick a place and just stay there.
[220:19.03]These are all done.
[220:19.61]This is done.
[220:20.31]This is done.
[220:22.11]Everything over here is done.

[223:15.89]I'm just not going to stop talking.
[223:18.23]So I'm just going to concentrate and stop speaking.
[223:21.99]But it's okay.
[223:22.47]You'll still hear things.
[223:24.07]Not like any of this commentary has changed at all.
[223:28.34]Shit.

[233:54.09]Alright.
[233:55.58]One.
[233:55.74]The fact that I have to look all the way down the screen.

[248:17.74]I really appreciate the help because I was stuck and I was locked.
[248:23.12]12, 13.
[248:23.48]So we can do if we deduce that this could happen.
[248:25.36]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[248:25.78]It's the whole damn thing.
[248:27.27]It's been deduced.
[248:36.04]Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen.
[248:39.06]We can deduce that.
[248:41.76]Uh, yeah, one.
[248:42.32]There's that.
[248:45.08]Okay.
[248:47.67]You're the one in yesterday.

[248:50.91]Alright, what else we got?
[248:54.95]Seven.
[248:56.37]Eight.
[248:57.19]You're fifteen down, so therefore that's fine.
[248:59.96]Five, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.
[249:06.78]Single four.
[249:12.60]Oh, nine.
[249:14.60]So we got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen.
[249:20.07]Twelve, eleven, ten, nine.
[249:21.43]One, two, three, four, filament.
[249:23.69]One, two, three, four, filament.
[249:28.41]Secret boop.
[249:30.57]Fifteen down?
[249:31.55]Uh, is there a fifteen down?
[249:32.27]Where do you see fifteen down?
[249:36.48]Hmm.
[249:40.02]10, 11, 12.
[249:40.18]So let's go like this.
[249:43.04]And we got 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, two on each side.
[249:45.66]Left two are done.
[249:46.24]Oh, shit.
[249:46.52]Okay.
[249:46.78]I think we can finish this one.
[249:48.10]5, 10, 11, 12, 13.
[249:48.20]We can, so that's 5.
[250:09.05]One, five.

[255:39.84]This is the League of Explorers.
[255:42.84]Who's ready for some adventure?
[255:47.16]It's me, Sir Finley Murgleton.
[255:54.93]Now you can't leave because it made sense as to why I did that.

[260:29.74]Uh, let's see.
[260:31.02]This is by Devin.
[260:32.20]I wonder if they're in the chat right now.
[260:33.50]It's possible.
[260:34.04]Is this 30x30?
[260:39.67]It's not even 30x30.
[260:40.05]10, 20, 22, 23, 24.
[260:40.15]What about... Jesus.
[260:40.65]Scared the hell out of me.

[285:51.80]I gotta talk about this one more time.
[285:55.00]So, I'm gonna be taking some absence here.
[286:00.05]I'm going to finalize and get to the absolute treatment plan of this chest and back problem that I've had.
[286:07.87]What's likely to happen is over the next few weeks, I'm going to try to get either intercostal injections to shut it up
[286:21.31]Probably do it a few places, somewhere along the spine trigger points and an intercostal potential intercostal nerve injection.
[286:30.61]I'm going to try it.
[286:31.61]I want to try it.
[286:32.35]I want to do it because there's a lot of stuff going on in 2021.
[286:36.42]The essentially we're, we're hitting ground running on a lot of projects.
[286:43.67]So there are at least four or five more streams, like the archaeology stream, that you will see within the next six months.
[286:53.03]This is not like, oh, wow, see you in like a year when we do something like that again.
[286:58.74]Because of the nature of doing as many of these as we kind of can in 2021, I have to get this under control.
[287:06.04]I also have some family stuff and some personal stuff to take care of too.
[287:09.90]So this is likely to be the final break
[287:14.52]Before I hopefully get over this bullshit with my back and chest and everything.
[287:20.06]And if it's not, then I'll keep doing it.
[287:22.12]But this, I'm at least gonna go get the injections.
[287:24.44]I'm gonna just, I talked to my doctor about it.
[287:27.05]We're setting up a plan.
[287:28.73]I'm just gonna be like, just stick me.
[287:32.23]Just stick him in me.
[287:34.01]Because I need to get a treatment plan.
[287:36.33]I have to.
[287:37.67]It's been too long with this shit.
[287:38.53]It's been three years.
[287:41.02]Now, obviously, I ruled out all the bad stuff, and that's what I was doing the two or three months I was gone.
[287:46.96]Ruling out everything that could be terrible.
[287:50.47]But it's time to take care of it.
[287:53.17]So I will see you on April 1st.
[287:57.80]And on April 2nd, I will have a shitload of announcements.
[288:00.46]Some stuff you're probably really going to look forward to.
[288:03.03]I know you have a lot of questions about the streams that you may have seen about Grotto Beasts.
[288:09.57]Just hold off.
[288:11.39]I will give you way more details.
[288:13.07]There'll be a lot of announcements in a few weeks.
[288:19.74]We'll see what I come back with on the 1st of April, okay?
[288:24.38]So, again, if people don't know what's going on, just use TLDRM.
[288:30.27]I really hate to take all this time off because I'm sure you guys all know we just, you know, we passed 500,000 followers.
[288:36.85]The channel is as big as it's ever been.
[288:39.93]And that's kind of like the, I guess I'll be real with you.
[288:41.75]That's kind of the sad part about this for me is the channel is like at peak popularity right now, like the last like eight to 10 months.
[288:51.80]And I'm just like fucking off every three months or so.
[288:55.22]You know what I mean?
[288:56.87]So that's kind of sad, but at the end of the day, I never cared about that shit anyways.
[289:03.75]This channel could have 5,000 viewers, 2,000 viewers, or 20,000 viewers.
[289:07.16]I'm still going to just keep doing the things that I do, and if you think it's fun, if you're here, then cool.
[289:14.14]I hope you enjoy it.
[289:14.96]I hope you like the stuff that we're doing here.
[289:17.12]20K or 2K, it doesn't matter.
[289:22.44]But not less than 2K.
[289:23.62]Absolutely not less than 2K.
[289:29.19]And again, before I go, there was just so much.
[289:35.23]It was like an overwhelming amount of things that we were seeing for the stream for the archaeology thing.
[289:39.56]And I'm just so happy that a lot of people involved in that project got like the attention and the recognition that they deserved.
[289:47.81]And I'm really, really happy about the Nevada Science Center stuff, too.
[289:50.63]So.
[289:52.82]I will be back on April 1st.
[289:54.14]I'll see you soon.
[289:54.84]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[289:56.76]This should be the final time that I disappear for more than a couple weeks at a time.
[290:01.91]And when I get back, maybe I'll fucking run a lap around my room and tell you that I got the intercostal injections.
[290:09.97]We'll see.
[290:12.54]Take care of yourselves.
[290:13.94]I'll be back on April 1st.
[290:17.70]Good luck to you all as well.
[290:21.38]Have fun.
[290:22.98]Don't miss me too much.
[290:24.11]I'm not going for like three months.
[290:25.71]We're only going for like three weeks.
[290:28.69]That's it.
[290:29.27]And then I'm back.
[290:30.85]And I'm going to be at least 80-90%.
[290:32.07]Time to go get the injections.
[290:37.74]I'll see you soon.
[290:38.92]Take care of yourselves.
[290:41.72]Good night.
[290:42.76]Goodbye.
[290:44.08]See you April 1st.
[290:44.76]80-90% Andy.
[290:46.34]That's me.
[290:54.56]Rerun the Simpson stream.
[290:56.20]Oh my god, that's so funny.
[291:03.37]I just do that again.
[291:04.45]I just rerun the Simpson stream.
[291:08.77]I actually might do that because it's so stupid.
[291:12.71]That sounds really dumb.
[291:15.26]Rerun the rerun.
[291:16.66]Oh my god.
[291:25.25]That might be funny.
[291:26.41]Alright, maybe I'll do that.
[291:28.06]Alright, goodnight everybody.
[291:35.06]I'll see you on April 1st.
[291:36.10]Take care of yourselves.
[291:36.74]Have a great few weeks.
[291:38.50]Sorry I have to do this again.
[291:39.84]But I really hope this is the last time I have to do this.
[291:43.39]Goodnight.
[291:44.51]Goodbye.
[291:45.87]See you very soon.
[291:46.51]There's a lot of fucking shit planned.
[291:48.19]A lot of stuff going to happen in the next few months.
[291:50.83]I hope you like it.
[291:51.37]Goodbye.
[292:06.46]Thank you.
