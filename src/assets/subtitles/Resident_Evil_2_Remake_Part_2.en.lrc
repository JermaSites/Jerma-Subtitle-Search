[ve:60.16.100]

[00:07.20]I feel alive!
[00:17.59]Oh hey, look, it's you again.
[00:19.73]How you doing?
[00:23.63]How's everybody?
[00:27.19]Has my brain healed?
[00:29.06]Um, yes, but no.
[00:32.77]Because I had an annoying headache yesterday.
[00:35.60]And if you get headaches, it sort of like turns you off for a little while.
[00:44.62]So I feel alright.
[00:45.86]I feel fine.
[00:47.48]And I rested up a little bit.
[00:49.58]But there's a notch up here that's like flicked off.
[00:54.79]It's hard to explain.
[00:57.89]But I'm good to go.
[01:02.59]If you got, like, seven notches in your brain that have to be turned on at all times... Uh... One of them is, like, reading.
[01:10.38]One of them is, like, arithmetic.
[01:12.44]One of them is, like, arguments and debates.
[01:15.38]And the other one is playing a video game.
[01:18.70]That one's probably turned off.
[01:20.73]I can read just fine.
[01:21.83]I'll prove it to you.
[01:28.01]Uh... Resident Evil 2.
[01:31.29]No, I made that up.
[01:32.88]I got that from memory.
[01:33.84]I need a piece of material I haven't seen yet.
[01:39.48]Get this back on.
[01:43.34]At the bottom there.
[01:45.08]Capcom.
[01:46.56]Coal Limited.
[01:48.48]1998.
[01:48.68]I'm fine.
[01:50.28]Oh, shit.
[01:52.30]I have to tweet that.
[01:53.26]Let me get a quick tweet.
[01:59.43]You know, I don't think I even tweeted last night, did I?
[02:07.16]No, I didn't.
[02:09.60]What kind of fucking streamer am I?
[02:15.28]And I know that I have... You can automatically have Twitter, when you go live, just send an automatic tweet.
[02:23.42]But I don't want to do that, I think.
[02:24.98]Right, you can do that?
[02:25.63]You can set that up?
[02:28.58]But when you do that, doesn't it just... No, I'd rather write... Like, on my own.
[02:42.41]Like, RE2... Coming at you.
[02:49.71]Right?
[02:50.37]And then... Give the website link.
[02:54.03]But I hope you guys are having a good day today.
[02:57.19]We're going to pick up exactly where we left off.
[03:02.78]No, I didn't do anything else after the stream.
[03:05.34]I kind of turned it off and just went right downstairs and hung out.
[03:11.02]Yeah, I can't do that with an automated system.
[03:14.48]And if I can, then... Oh, fuck, I didn't know I could.
[03:18.60]Let's adjust some audio here.
[03:21.76]And why don't... Hey!
[03:22.96]Hey!
[03:24.04]Why don't I bring the villain hair back?
[03:25.68]You know what I mean?
[03:26.94]That's too bright.
[03:27.62]This is too bright.
[03:30.20]I need to be in a different spot.
[03:42.00]Okay.
[03:45.00]There we go.
[03:47.41]Still light outside, but it won't be for long.
[03:54.08]Put on the sunglasses.
[03:57.04]No, I'm alright.
[03:58.04]I'm alright.
[03:58.96]If I need to, I have an old pair of shitty gunner optics that I threw in the trash.
[04:05.06]And then I went, ah, I probably shouldn't have thrown those in the trash.
[04:07.90]Because those were expensive.
[04:09.22]Those were expensive pieces of yellow glass.
[04:11.76]So I took them out of the trash, and I put them back on the table, and I wiped them clean with a little bit of Lysol.
[04:25.22]I got a beard!
[04:25.94]No, it's called lazy and annoyed, so I haven't shaved.
[04:29.82]Uh, he's using hair tonic.
[04:34.19]Hair tonic.
[04:36.67]Anywho, this should be good.
[04:38.05]I'm gonna drop the volume just a bit, though, because I don't... I feel like it's overpowering my little baby voice that's coming out of here.
[04:46.44]Um... Can I...?
[04:51.74]Oh, these are unlock... I thought this was chapter select.
[04:55.68]All right, eat this.
[04:57.50]That'll hold them.
[04:58.56]A new model for the Matilda.
[05:03.17]Okay, bonuses.
[05:04.39]What's this?
[05:04.73]I don't want to see the model.
[05:05.61]It actually looks... Yeah, these things are fucking scary.
[05:15.22]It's a pretty good game.
[05:26.57]Yep.
[05:29.81]Let's go.
[05:31.79]Exactly where we were.
[05:34.57]I'm gonna move this over here.
[05:37.87]Jeremy's face should not be there, right?
[05:39.52]Jeremy's face needs to be somewhere else.
[05:44.42]Alright, we're good?
[05:49.46]We're good, let's fucking go.
[05:52.18]Let me just check my fucking twitch ability.
[05:53.60]Because remember I told you, like, reading comprehension, off.
[05:59.04]Light detection, on.
[06:00.68]Smell, off.
[06:03.13]FPS twitch shooting detection.
[06:05.83]Uh-oh.
[06:07.53]Might have a problem.
[06:09.87]Might have a problem.
[06:13.11]Uh, so where are we?
[06:14.15]Let's see.
[06:14.96]I'm excited for Resident Evil 2.
[06:20.89]So, remind me the last thing we did, because I don't remember.
[06:23.19]Because memory, memory, memory has been turned off.
[06:27.07]That's a blue herb.
[06:27.89]I've got a save point.
[06:29.05]Let's do it again.
[06:30.81]Engage the bionic boomers, please, sir.
[06:38.90]FPS shooting detection functioning at 75%.
[06:40.88]Yeah, I'm going to have to go into the reserves for this one.
[06:44.66]I'm going to bring the red jewel, because I want to.
[06:51.16]And I think it'll do me some good.
[06:52.48]Let's store that.
[06:53.32]Do I have any heals at all?
[06:56.61]I have the one big one.
[07:03.05]I got one big heal and I'm afraid to use it because it's the only one I have.
[07:06.51]I have so many little toys now.
[07:12.32]The crank.
[07:13.28]I got the diamond key.
[07:14.84]I got the car key.
[07:16.60]I have the box.
[07:19.45]Let me go out back to the garage.
[07:23.79]Because... There were cars out here.
[07:28.05]Wasn't there?
[07:28.43]Like, should I go look at the cars?
[07:31.59]Let's take a look.
[07:38.80]Uh, car number is 7439.
[07:42.58]So... Oh, shit.
[07:48.14]Did I just unlock the door?
[07:52.91]Uh-oh.
[07:54.35]Oh, wait, no, no, no, hold on.
[07:57.15]What's going on in the bottom there?
[07:58.17]Why are there little prongs that are sticking in and sticking out?
[08:10.70]Do all the prongs need to be up?
[08:21.85]Prong 1 and 2.
[08:22.51]Look at prong 2 comes up.
[08:25.61]Probably some fucking puzzle.
[08:27.56]Alright, box electronic parts.
[08:30.84]This is... I need two of these.
[08:34.26]Or not.
[08:37.80]A small electronic part.
[08:41.60]It sure is right there, isn't it?
[08:45.34]Do I have to examine this cube too?
[08:48.77]So it's four prongs.
[08:51.78]Custom part for a power panel.
[08:54.58]Yeah, I'm gonna have to start to write down shit.
[09:01.18]You know what I mean?
[09:02.30]I need a notebook that I can just write information down in.
[09:10.67]Save.
[09:11.91]Always.
[09:13.83]Okay.
[09:15.15]Let's just take a look and see what's in these things.
[09:17.45]We've got some gunpowder.
[09:21.75]Uh, a lot of bullets.
[09:25.26]And... How many of those am I supposed to destroy before it becomes, uh, worthwhile?
[09:39.02]Magazine ammo.
[09:39.76]Well, that's magnum ammo, isn't it?
[09:43.40]Electrical part.
[09:44.17]Alright, let's combine some shit.
[09:46.85]Put some stuff in the storage.
[09:56.92]Shotgun shells.
[10:00.90]Uh, do I make more shotgun shells, or... Just fucking boarded windows.
[10:09.88]I have too many items that I don't know what to do with.
[10:14.30]Um, how about... We're gonna have to put some of these away.
[10:19.59]We just do.
[10:20.13]I'll have to come back and get them.
[10:22.75]How about... Let's make some more shotgun shells.
[10:27.86]because you can never have too many of these.
[10:30.68]Let's put the car key.
[10:35.32]No, keep the car key.
[10:38.30]Store the magnum bullets.
[10:44.61]Wooden boards, I'm still just gonna have the red jewel.
[10:48.03]Maybe just get rid of it for now.
[10:51.51]I got the fancy looking key.
[10:56.01]Oh.
[10:57.03]Combine the key now.
[10:59.15]Alright, let's go back to the garage.
[11:03.43]My favorite game.
[11:04.69]Resident Evil 2 Inventory Simulator.
[11:06.75]Yeah.
[11:09.01]It's kind of part of the fun, though.
[11:11.09]I'm not gonna lie.
[11:13.03]The last couple days, like yesterday and today, it's been kind of part of the fun.
[11:17.77]So, I need to go to... My generator room is right here.
[11:24.98]parking garage.
[11:25.80]So how the fuck do I get down here straight and then down?
[11:31.97]I'm just getting back to the parking garage.
[11:33.41]Are those shotgun shells?
[11:34.37]No.
[11:36.63]You know what?
[11:36.93]I'm gonna board these windows up.
[11:44.09]Right?
[11:44.39]I mean, like, why not?
[11:50.48]I want... Yeah, I want to be safe.
[11:54.04]Uh...
[11:56.10]All right, so this is going to take us out here, and then we're going to bring up right into the parking garage, and we're going to open up car 74272.
[12:10.55]Straight ahead.
[12:14.36]Oh, wait, there's a shotgun?
[12:25.46]What the fuck are the dogs doing over here?
[12:28.52]What the hell?
[12:40.01]Oh, shit.
[12:45.08]Assholes.
[13:01.76]This is a loud fucking game.
[13:04.80]You know what I mean?
[13:05.98]I gotta turn that down.
[13:11.44]Okay, we're looking for a car.
[13:12.84]We're looking for... Maybe I beep the thing here?
[13:15.82]What car was it?
[13:32.49]This... white one right here?
[13:42.68]Which one of these cars is open?
[13:50.16]Is he wearing a shower cap?
[13:52.94]Uh, no.
[13:53.40]No, he's not wearing a shower cap, I can assure you.
[13:55.80]Ooh.
[13:58.76]It's gun stock.
[14:00.73]Custom part for the Matilda shower cap.
[14:04.98]What am I like a fucking lunch lady?
[14:08.20]A custom part of the Matilda that allows the gun to fire three rounds per pull of the trigger.
[14:22.61]This is, that's interesting looking.
[14:24.91]All right.
[14:26.19]Did it just get bigger?
[14:29.46]No, it just now takes up two inventory spaces.
[14:36.64]Oh, goddammit.
[14:37.40]Whatever.
[14:38.08]Okay.
[14:39.34]Well, I don't need the car key anymore.
[14:43.46]I got my upgrade.
[14:46.11]It was foolish.
[14:49.17]That's a terrible looking gun.
[14:50.33]Yeah, it does look like it was made out of, like, Nerf guns and Legos.
[14:54.61]Now what the hell does it look like?
[14:55.61]This looks like...
[15:00.31]It looks like a nerf gun.
[15:01.53]Like a nerf attachment.
[15:04.81]So that's that.
[15:06.45]So that we... No, what else do I have?
[15:10.96]I got the... diamond key.
[15:13.46]Let me see.
[15:16.62]Back at the main hall.
[15:19.30]What was the shit that was over here?
[15:22.72]Some of these are diamond keys.
[15:23.72]That's heart.
[15:26.26]Club.
[15:29.03]Where's that diamond, diamond queen, you know?
[15:32.37]Follow that queen, follow that queen, follow that diamond queen!
[15:37.15]Not up here.
[15:38.33]Second floor?
[15:41.44]Electronically locked door.
[15:43.36]Diamond door!
[15:44.96]There's a diamond door over here.
[15:47.48]Uh, five community subs from Great Canadian Fuck Club.
[15:52.61]Thank you.
[15:54.29]Thank you so much, Great Canadian.
[15:57.03]Just consistently, constantly adding to your tally.
[16:00.37]Thank you.
[16:02.45]So, what the heck would crank handle slot?
[16:12.17]I could go all the way, I could go over here.
[16:13.73]Yeah, I'm gonna bring the crank back down to this area down here on the second floor.
[16:24.72]I think that would be prudent.
[16:26.74]Right?
[16:27.69]I think that would be prudent.
[16:31.01]Let's go get it.
[16:35.23]I really don't want to use this.
[16:37.11]But I might have to.
[16:39.21]So, I'm gonna keep the key just in case I get, uh, overzealous.
[16:44.99]So, you know.
[16:48.21]Let's do what we need to do.
[16:48.99]Ooh, there's a diamond door right here!
[16:53.17]Let's check it out.
[17:03.79]Oh, no, this is the shooting range.
[17:17.90]Where are you?
[17:18.60]Oh, where is this person?
[17:20.52]Where is the person?
[17:28.76]Alright, let's go.
[17:30.40]I'm just gonna blow your head off.
[17:35.31]Didn't blow your head off, though.
[17:36.49]Unbelievable.
[17:38.09]Unbo- Fuck me!
[17:43.25]What a waste of a shotgun bullet.
[17:46.94]Can I, like, stomp on the head?
[17:48.14]Does film... Damn it.
[17:57.75]I think that's it, that's it.
[18:00.99]I got film, though.
[18:05.12]This isn't Dead Space.
[18:07.10]Why not?
[18:16.60]Oh, fuck.
[18:17.36]Well, it's okay.
[18:19.83]What's that noise?
[18:24.71]I- Why?
[18:25.23]You should be able to run over and just step there on their head.
[18:28.87]Come on, man.
[18:29.51]Step your game up.
[18:31.85]How do I get by you?
[18:37.72]You stupid- I can't really- You just did that to me.
[18:51.57]I can't fucking believe it.
[18:53.11]I was gonna do that to you.
[18:54.37]You're not supposed to be able to do that to me.
[18:55.43]I was gonna do it to you.
[18:58.57]Why didn't I shoot- I- Cause I- I don't- I- I- She- The animation started when she grabbed me by the fucking chesticles.
[19:06.65]She like pulled me in by both chest areas.
[19:10.19]And started biting me.
[19:15.02]God damn it.
[19:15.68]I just took so much unnecessary damage.
[19:17.74]Alright.
[19:18.74]So I need to go.
[19:20.36]But I did get some film.
[19:22.40]So I need to go back to... Turn around up the stairs.
[19:27.16]Go up here.
[19:28.28]Break room.
[19:28.84]Okay.
[19:29.06]So I need to go... Back.
[19:33.48]This way.
[19:35.40]And then... This way.
[19:39.44]He's doing the end of the stream voice.
[19:41.74]What?
[19:49.49]End of the stream voice.
[19:50.71]No.
[19:52.79]Oh, feels bad.
[19:53.83]Stream over.
[19:56.03]The stream is not over.
[19:59.11]We'll just get started, okay?
[20:04.15]But...
[20:05.85]I need to bring this thing.
[20:10.45]I'm gonna store this thing, because I don't want to use it.
[20:14.92]That's my rare Lucario amiibo.
[20:17.50]I can't even take it out of the box, okay?
[20:26.60]So we're gonna go... store the film, too, for now.
[20:32.03]I need tool.
[20:33.75]Store the herb.
[20:36.40]I'll keep this one.
[20:37.86]This is a full health restore.
[20:42.83]So this, we're gonna get back to the crank, I'm gonna keep the key, and I'm gonna board up a couple of windows.
[20:49.95]That sounds good to me.
[20:54.03]Say, how many saves, it saves 24 different saves from compulsive panic saving.
[21:01.68]I can't imagine, how many saves do you get in hardcore?
[21:04.72]Do you get like eight?
[21:06.54]The whole game.
[21:08.48]Well, that would make me just absolutely livid.
[21:12.60]I can get the... No, let me get the electrical part, too.
[21:17.03]You get 20.
[21:19.13]Through the whole game.
[21:20.01]Ugh, that sucks.
[21:24.76]I'm gonna hold on to that electrical part.
[21:26.70]Now, I know I'm gonna be probably rage quitting.
[21:28.72]I'm gonna rage quit the game.
[21:30.50]Right?
[21:31.14]In like 20 minutes because I'm gonna need that.
[21:34.44]So... I'm gonna hold on to it.
[21:37.73]I got plenty of slots for all this shit.
[21:40.93]Alright, let's go.
[21:44.47]Heal?
[21:44.99]No, no, I'm not gonna heal yet.
[21:45.91]I got a full heal in my inventory.
[21:48.00]I can get one more bite taken out of me before I have to heal.
[21:52.90]So...
[21:56.61]Okay.
[21:58.37]Down, and then here.
[22:00.27]So we're going to go down, out of this way.
[22:05.98]Can I get in there?
[22:08.80]Can I get in?
[22:11.44]Is there a way for me to get over there?
[22:12.50]I'm going to board up some of these windows.
[22:30.07]How did you not get fucking staggered by that?
[22:32.23]What?
[22:42.03]Oh, my.
[22:42.71]This is just a fucking choose-your-own-adventure game where you turn the wrong corner and you die.
[22:47.23]I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
[23:03.93]That was, you could go down this, into the forest, or you could turn right and go down the, the, in between the rocks into the alleyway.
[23:11.87]And I picked the alleyway.
[23:13.43]Ah, well, see what happened was, there were three zombies there and you died.
[23:16.09]Oh.
[23:20.31]Looks like I'm gonna have to go into the forest.
[23:28.77]Why didn't I heal?
[23:29.38]Because it was, it was a waste.
[23:31.58]It was a waste of a heal.
[23:33.08]Because I'm not going to get hit by any of these guys now.
[23:34.72]Check this out.
[23:37.14]I have... no.
[23:39.06]I made sure I remember this one.
[23:45.79]Okay.
[23:49.73]Let's do it again.
[23:50.95]I'm going to go down the choose your own adventure hallway.
[23:55.80]Which would do it... this door, right?
[23:58.42]Hello.
[23:58.84]How are you?
[24:11.15]That's one down.
[24:13.45]And then there's you.
[24:20.11]What the?
[24:21.19]Put it in.
[24:23.48]I don't know.
[24:25.04]What's this?
[24:29.38]Why?
[24:36.86]What's on the wall?
[24:39.42]Oh, fuck off.
[24:44.37]The guy with the fucking internal organs coming out is still alive.
[24:55.80]The guy in like the fucking pile of bodies.
[24:57.80]Alright, we're good.
[25:05.01]That brings us to exactly where I wanted.
[25:08.93]Did I forget about him?
[25:11.56]He should have been dead.
[25:13.36]Nobody can survive what he went through.
[25:15.00]Alright, so we gotta go.
[25:21.13]Back into the main hall.
[25:23.17]And then, wait, where's the fire escape?
[25:26.71]I'm actually right next to it, so we gotta go up that way.
[25:31.33]Oh, god damn it.
[25:35.43]Just leave me alone.
[25:46.19]Why is everybody spamming P?
[25:47.53]Yeah, what's going on?
[25:48.05]Why are people writing P?
[25:53.09]You can't go that way.
[25:54.23]But it doesn't matter.
[25:54.73]I need to just go right there.
[25:55.44]There it is.
[25:58.42]Okay.
[26:03.32]Is there... Oh.
[26:05.74]That's exactly where I want to be.
[26:09.30]Let's crank it up.
[26:16.67]I don't know the secret meme.
[26:17.83]I don't know any memes.
[26:19.69]Half the time I don't know what the hell anybody's talking about.
[26:25.62]Let's take it slow.
[26:34.50]There's one of those... dolls.
[26:41.20]I do hear noises.
[26:44.12]Chiropractor?
[26:47.11]That is a heart door.
[26:48.03]I don't have the key for it.
[26:55.61]So this will take me down... or up.
[27:01.34]I guess I could go to the roof, maybe?
[27:03.00]From here?
[27:03.38]Where does this go?
[27:10.38]More boards.
[27:11.02]I'll just take them.
[27:21.21]Oh.
[27:21.93]Free stuff.
[27:24.21]Magnum ammo?
[27:25.29]No, that's just regular handgun ammo.
[27:31.17]Left eye.
[27:31.65]Middle eye.
[27:32.09]Right eye.
[27:34.60]Flashbang.
[27:36.60]Change equipped sub-weapon.
[27:46.70]Is there a way I can... There we go.
[27:48.30]I didn't know if I could put anything else there.
[27:55.09]East storage room or balcony?
[27:56.71]Let's go to the east storage room.
[27:59.45]I feel like there's going to be a safe point in here.
[28:02.36]Because it is a storage room.
[28:09.85]Absolutely not.
[28:22.76]Where the fuck are you?
[28:25.50]Where is it?
[28:25.94]Where?
[28:27.44]Okay, what's this?
[28:29.63]A large gear?
[28:32.07]It's huge!
[28:33.35]A rusty old gear.
[28:34.11]It looks like it belongs to some machine or another.
[28:36.27]It's- That's two slots?!
[28:39.40]That's unfair.
[28:41.98]Two slots.
[29:07.37]I can't get out of this door either?
[29:08.41]I don't even know why I shouldn't be shooting this guy.
[29:25.92]So, I gotta go out... I can go out here.
[29:28.52]No, I can't.
[29:33.64]Is every door locked up?
[29:37.64]I got the gear, whatever the hell that's for.
[29:41.08]There were two guys in here.
[29:42.13]Let's check the balcony.
[29:55.96]Running out of room, it's completely gone now.
[30:01.40]But I got the gear for... What is that for?
[30:11.20]Oh, this is done.
[30:15.49]Alright, so I have one more spot.
[30:17.29]I could go down from here.
[30:18.31]I've got plenty of ammo.
[30:25.36]Let's go down.
[30:27.86]There's not gonna be a monster just sitting right here, is there?
[30:44.43]Get rid of your handgun!
[30:46.69]No.
[30:50.41]And why does Leon have a little BB gun?
[31:01.96]He's shooting little rocks out of this gun, not even bullets.
[31:07.40]Water?
[31:07.66]Okay, well.
[31:12.17]Obviously missing a pipe.
[31:16.54]Is there a pipe lying around here or do I gotta come back later and get the pipe?
[31:23.33]Water valve lever.
[31:26.47]I'm gonna have to come back here and stick a pipe up there.
[31:40.50]Alright.
[31:41.22]So... This is a door I have not... Let me... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[31:43.96]Let me check.
[31:45.78]Because I haven't been out here, right?
[31:46.80]No, I'm, like, on the roof.
[31:52.14]Is that... I can go that way.
[31:53.16]Hold on.
[31:54.42]So many branching paths in this story.
[32:02.63]Well, this would not be here for no reason, so... I guess I could combine... I'm gonna combine...
[32:13.06]There's a poison monster here.
[32:14.60]There's going to be a poison enemy.
[32:17.42]It's going to happen.
[32:27.73]It's going to be like... Fucking acid is going to go on my face.
[32:31.61]And it's going to be the first tutorial.
[32:36.53]There's a thousand people over there.
[32:42.02]Oh, there's like five people.
[32:45.70]Is that just one very, very, very... Okay, quickly, quickly!
[33:07.53]What's in here?
[33:09.81]Gunpowder.
[33:11.33]What else is in here?
[33:11.91]Quickly.
[33:12.93]Before they get up.
[33:13.63]Anything else?
[33:15.83]Nothing else right here?
[33:20.20]Quickly!
[33:20.68]Hurry up!
[33:21.64]What's in here?
[33:22.10]What's in here?
[33:22.52]What's in here?
[33:22.94]What's in here?
[33:23.40]Ooh.
[33:25.88]A key.
[33:27.52]Club.
[33:29.72]Ugh.
[33:31.14]Thank you.
[33:31.52]That's okay.
[33:35.73]There's a... There's a box right here.
[33:42.47]Red herb.
[33:43.41]Combine.
[33:44.89]Please.
[33:45.29]I got two super duper ultra heals now.
[34:02.00]Okay.
[34:02.50]So I also now have too many amiibos.
[34:07.38]And I'm not going to use them.
[34:11.78]This is a full RGB heal.
[34:13.42]I have three of them now, and I'm not going to use them.
[34:20.05]What's going on with the happy face?
[34:25.63]Combine GRB with H with B. I can't.
[34:29.89]I'm sorry, guys.
[34:30.53]I have no idea what that person just asked me to do.
[34:32.57]Combine these two, and I get an ultra super mega herb.
[34:38.51]No, I don't.
[34:42.12]I get like a super- no, that's not true.
[34:47.36]Don't F-U-C-K with me, you know what I mean?
[34:48.92]Don't F-U-C-K with me.
[34:51.76]This knife sucks.
[34:52.50]I'm just gonna stab somebody with it.
[34:54.42]I'll keep one of these.
[34:58.34]Large gear.
[34:59.32]I'm gonna store it for now.
[35:00.56]I don't know.
[35:01.84]I don't know where any of this stuff is supposed to go.
[35:06.05]Hmm.
[35:09.30]I still have doors to open.
[35:10.38]I gotta open up all the doors that need a key so that I can just throw them in the trash.
[35:19.34]You're gonna get the boulder punching ability.
[35:21.39]I can't wait for that.
[35:33.53]Somebody said he missed X, he missed Y, he missed Z. No, I didn't.
[35:38.12]Not yet.
[35:38.44]I just wanted to get in here.
[35:39.88]I'm going back.
[35:40.32]I'm turning back around.
[35:40.82]I'm going back up the stairs.
[35:45.02]So, we've got... Do I have any... I do.
[35:51.10]Okay.
[35:51.70]Three flashbangs.
[35:54.31]The two keys.
[35:56.19]I've got a couple of slots now.
[35:57.71]Alright.
[35:58.39]Good.
[35:58.75]Thank God this is a little point that they could save for me.
[36:04.34]Yeah, I miss Z's all the time.
[36:08.30]Going to bed at 4 a.m.
[36:09.36]Come on, ready?
[36:20.45]These two are going to get up, so let me go out.
[36:23.09]Water valve that can go up around here.
[36:34.74]Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
[36:39.80]Left to right.
[36:40.56]What the fuck did that do?
[36:44.81]Why, I don't know what that did.
[36:49.61]Panic.
[36:56.58]You don't actually come all the way back up here.
[36:57.92]Alright, so wait, what if... Did that do anything with this?
[37:24.28]So what does that do for me?
[37:26.10]There's no item in here?
[37:27.69]Nothing in here?
[37:30.15]How could there not be something in here?
[37:45.07]How could there not be something in there?
[37:49.43]That's bullshit.
[38:00.74]Jesus Christ!
[38:03.00]Okay, um... Okay, so, like, Gerber Rumble Rorschach is now fighting- facing me.
[38:10.60]Fucking Dick Tracy is coming after me now.
[38:13.46]What am I supposed... Is this an en... What do I do about this guy?
[38:22.60]Does he just fucking chase you around?
[38:24.66]No, they... Of course they had to add, like, a nemesis.
[38:33.75]Oh my fucking god.
[38:34.99]Should I shoot him?
[38:52.96]Okay.
[38:53.48]Well, he's there.
[39:09.41]So that's why they put the autosave here.
[39:11.73]Okay.
[39:12.99]Because... fucking Slenderman and Dick Tracy had a baby.
[39:18.99]Alright.
[39:19.67]I'm gonna bait him out here.
[39:23.95]Come on, climb up the broken ladder!
[39:29.57]Okay, hold on, wait for him.
[39:35.13]I'm just gonna run by him and then run by the helicopter.
[39:47.31]Alright, does he have any, like, stretchy powers or anything?
[39:49.53]He doesn't have any stretchy powers, right?
[39:59.60]Where the fuck am I?
[40:06.43]Straight through the waiting room?
[40:15.77]Because this is open, right?
[40:18.24]Lose him in the main hall.
[40:24.34]He does not follow in here.
[40:30.74]Alright, I lost him.
[40:34.14]Yeah, this is like a sanctuary.
[40:35.40]He can't come in here.
[40:46.27]Okay.
[40:48.43]So I have the club key.
[40:50.95]I got some jewels.
[40:52.81]I have some healing.
[40:55.69]You're safe in a horror game.
[40:57.09]I don't think I'm fairly safe right now.
[41:05.73]I could flashbang him.
[41:14.50]Okay.
[41:16.56]That puts us here.
[41:17.96]There are some, there's a club key over here in the records room.
[41:24.76]What's with my hair?
[41:28.85]What's wrong with my hair?
[41:29.95]You can't even like see it.
[41:30.81]I mean, it might be, maybe it's a little messy today.
[41:37.10]So that's... this way.
[41:48.08]Up here, and then the first club key is down, and then around.
[41:52.80]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[41:53.40]No!
[41:53.50]What?
[41:53.62]What?
[42:06.99]What?
[42:19.53]I just, uh, opened the door.
[42:39.21]What the fuck is that guy?
[42:40.63]No, it's not.
[42:43.23]What a fucking idiot I am.
[42:45.78]Get away, please.
[42:46.72]I thought it was the fucking guy with the hat on.
[42:51.20]Oh my god, that would have been one of the scariest things ever in a video game.
[42:56.33]It still kind of was.
[42:57.27]And I'm going to die.
[42:57.91]I need to heal.
[42:59.71]No, but this is my Lucario.
[43:11.93]Goddammit!
[43:12.59]Alright, that's a jack.
[44:19.68]Okay.
[44:22.02]So.
[44:22.26]Uh, the records room is blocked off currently by a heart door.
[44:32.35]That was the worst thing, that was the worst thing ever.
[44:41.57]Like, I'll give you a point, I'll give Resident Evil 2 points.
[44:44.11]They did, the guy breaks through the fucking door and you think it's the guy.
[44:49.56]Okay, I think I need to go back in here, but... What am I supposed to do about this?
[44:57.19]What do I... He's made out of stone!
[45:03.81]I can't even hurt him!
[45:08.95]He's made out of, like, fucking cement!
[45:15.84]Alright, wait a minute.
[45:16.58]I need to... What do I have?
[45:17.82]I need to... I got the... What is this?
[45:22.56]It's a jack.
[45:24.00]I gotta jack this up.
[45:31.28]That's in the second floor.
[45:35.01]I need to look at the map to see where all the keys are.
[45:40.58]That's a locked door, heart door.
[45:44.04]Any more clubs that are in the vicinity?
[45:47.98]No.
[45:49.83]But I do have the jack, which the jack, I'm gonna throw up.
[45:55.11]The jack is for here.
[45:57.73]So that's second floor.
[45:59.55]I'm on the first floor right now.
[46:01.09]I gotta go into the operations room, through the safety deposit area, through operations room over the corner there,
[46:10.04]Up the stairs, and then into the library.
[46:17.97]Ready?
[46:19.25]One, two, three, go.
[46:20.03]Am I going the right way?
[46:24.92]Boy, he's so fucking fast, isn't he?
[46:30.76]Where's the secret exit?
[46:36.75]Go, go, go!
[46:37.61]Get away from him!
[46:43.57]What the hell are you doing over here?
[46:45.35]Okay, so stop.
[46:48.65]The fucking haunted house.
[46:53.08]I gotta run by him.
[46:54.58]Straight.
[46:55.76]Around.
[46:57.46]I'm going into the dark room.
[46:58.74]I got the film.
[46:59.60]I got the film.
[47:00.52]Around.
[47:01.06]Throw it!
[47:13.81]Holy shit.
[47:21.28]I'm like two lickers.
[47:28.28]I'm too wound up.
[47:29.10]I swear to God.
[47:31.86]Oh, fuck.
[47:39.45]Please don't kill me here.
[47:40.85]Please don't kill me.
[47:41.41]Please don't kill me.
[47:42.53]Please don't kill me.
[47:43.83]Please just get in the dark room.
[47:45.87]Get in the dark room.
[47:46.57]They can't get you in here.
[47:47.39]It's a safe zone.
[47:48.01]Oh my fucking god.
[48:18.00]He can't come in the darkroom, right?
[48:20.12]Like, he can't come in here and like crash my photo-creating party.
[48:25.30]Oh my god.
[48:26.14]Oh.
[48:26.91]Ooh.
[48:33.03]Third floor locker, DCM.
[48:36.20]DCM.
[48:38.58]Nice.
[48:42.28]I thought I had a fucking headache yesterday.
[48:43.86]I was like, you know, this is not going to be like calm.
[48:47.78]He's just out there.
[48:48.60]He's just waiting outside for me.
[48:50.68]I fucking can't even possibly comprehend.
[48:58.05]I'm going to have to, I don't know.
[49:00.17]I got to get like flame bullets.
[49:06.26]I don't know what to do.
[49:08.14]But we're going to have to deal with it.
[49:09.90]So I need to bring out another one of these because I'm very hurt.
[49:18.06]I need... I could do some more gunpowder.
[49:26.95]I don't need it right now.
[49:27.71]Let's reload the guns.
[49:32.46]I'm not, I don't think I'm gonna run into any of these keys.
[49:34.60]So let me see, let's reload the guns.
[49:42.44]Try giving him, you need directional audio.
[50:05.56]I almost cried.
[50:08.13]Okay.
[50:11.53]I need to go.
[50:13.13]I'm at caution.
[50:16.41]I can take another hit.
[50:18.71]So the jack goes... So now I'm in here.
[50:22.83]I'm going to get out here and go up the stairs.
[50:26.42]Get out, go up the stairs, and then figure it out from there.
[50:30.14]Are there any more things I need to take?
[50:35.68]I don't think so.
[50:39.93]Although, how the fuck am I supposed to know?
[50:44.83]Here we go.
[50:51.28]Up the door, up the stairs.
[50:53.94]Croacher, thanks for five community subs.
[50:56.76]Thank you so much.
[51:03.95]No, that was just you guys.
[51:15.92]Okay, then I gotta go... I need to get to the... I need to get here.

[51:27.48]I gotta go... Fuck.
[51:32.09]I can't go around, can I?
[51:33.15]I gotta go back to the main hall, I think.
[51:43.13]Through the shower room...
[51:45.66]Through the lounge.
[51:46.40]I just gotta go all- I gotta go all the way around.
[51:50.83]Shit.
[51:51.99]Wait, is this- was it the third floor?
[51:54.45]No, that's the- that's the third floor locker, which is right there.
[51:59.42]I'm gonna go up there and get that locker.
[52:13.27]Okay, there it is.
[52:13.79]What was it?
[52:14.15]D?
[52:15.37]It was like DCM or something, right?
[52:21.11]Is there somebody coming behind me?
[52:22.13]Is he like here?
[52:22.95]No, he's not.
[52:23.37]Stop.
[52:24.99]Uh, Guild Hero, thanks for the five community subs.
[52:28.38]Thank you so much.
[52:34.08]Five community subs.

[52:40.26]That's alright, I guess.
[52:56.06]Okay.
[52:57.66]Left, left?
[52:58.44]No!
[53:26.53]I got an achievement for that.
[53:27.85]I don't know what it was.
[53:29.04]I got an actual achievement for doing that.
[53:35.12]So I have the jack, right?
[53:36.16]Did I not bring the jack in my... No, it's there.
[53:38.23]So the jack needs to go there.
[53:39.59]I gotta take care of these monsters.
[53:46.25]How am I gonna...
[53:52.11]How the hell am I gonna do this?
[53:53.81]I have to, like, go- I'm- alright.
[53:56.47]There's, like, four zombies down here.
[53:58.06]I gotta make the shots count.
[54:07.00]That's not doing it.
[54:08.16]That's not doing it.
[54:18.46]Jack it up.
[54:21.98]Alright.
[54:24.06]What did that do?
[54:29.06]Watch out, watch out.
[54:29.64]Somebody's behind you.
[54:30.27]Somebody's behind you right now.
[54:45.11]What the fuck is in here?
[55:14.83]Where is he?
[55:16.31]What door is he in?
[55:18.39]Where is he?
[55:19.67]I seriously don't know where the fuck he is.
[55:24.50]Is he right next to me?
[56:45.02]Fucking Daffy Duck motherfucker!
[56:48.10]Get away from me!
[57:18.09]I need to try to get, he's his slow ass, needs to get up the ladder.
[57:32.06]Oh, get down!
[57:32.94]Why did he do that?
[58:06.34]Okay.
[58:07.92]It's just as simple as one, two, three.
[58:10.25]Just get down.
[58:43.69]And then, what am I supposed to do with this?
[58:59.29]Oh.
[59:00.65]My god, this is... So the one all the way to the left has to be pulled out.
[59:14.72]So this one pull, and then there's gonna be like a secret passage right here.
[59:20.93]Hurry up, Leon!
[59:21.89]You don't have any time!
[59:22.85]Out of time!
[59:24.47]Out of time!
[59:47.26]Okay, so now I should be able to get through this.
[59:54.55]Wait, he's looking at me!
[59:59.81]Oh, God!
[60:04.26]You dick!
[60:31.84]Is this going to work?
[60:35.30]Is that going to do anything?
[60:36.32]I don't know where... Is it going up the stairs?
[60:50.28]One, two, three, four, five.
[60:53.48]No, that... I can...
[61:07.80]Ow, my mouth!
[61:13.86]Okay, I can run across that?
[61:16.55]I just unhinged my mouth like a snake about to eat a goat.
[61:37.10]I got it.
[61:37.50]I did it!
[61:37.80]I can go in this door.
[61:56.01]Where the fuck am I going?
[61:56.99]Okay, east storage room.
[62:00.14]Clock tower?
[62:00.96]Oh, the clock!
[62:01.68]I gotta go to the clock tower!
[62:09.02]You don't know how to fuck with Jax!
[62:20.05]I don't care.
[62:20.45]I don't care.
[62:21.25]I'm so... He doesn't still follow you across the whole fucking game.
[62:37.42]How long does he do this for?
[62:40.17]It's a dead end here, ladies and gentlemen.
[62:55.80]Alright, I can't fully settle.
[63:04.98]Where am I supposed to go?
[63:11.66]Oh, I need the stupid... I need the hand crank.
[63:25.62]He's still fucking following me.
[63:52.16]What the hell is this?
[63:53.84]A large gunpowder... and a rocket raccoon.
[64:06.91]Okay, um... Through the... Okay.
[64:26.16]Clock tower.
[64:29.46]Locked door.
[64:30.22]I don't have any goddamn keys.
[64:36.57]What's the over-under that it's a 50-50 chance that it's a fucking diamond or a club?
[64:53.03]Oh, man, unbelievable.
[64:54.05]This game is fucking terrible.
[64:56.15]No, no, but no, no, no.
[64:58.42]This game is fucking great, but... Oh, the stress and anxiety.
[65:13.85]He heard that.
[65:14.63]No, this is great.
[65:16.95]This is...
[65:20.51]This is fucking terrible.
[65:22.83]In, like, the best possible way.
[65:24.85]He's not gonna be right behind here, right?
[65:26.52]Oh, I'm still... I'm getting residual shockwaves from when he first opened that door, and I...
[65:49.98]What is that thing?
[65:50.80]Alright, I need the double... I need the big wheel to turn that.
[65:58.92]What's this?
[65:59.94]Repair plan.
[66:01.32]Okay, police station west side clock tower.
[66:03.17]Due to the high cultural value of the bell, I'm calling a specialist in to make the repairs.
[66:09.87]We'll go over the details once they're on the scene, but in the meantime, I'll take steps to secure the bell since the yoke is threatening to break.
[66:18.33]Okay.
[66:19.89]Well, this is also another thing that I have, right?
[66:23.47]What the fuck was that noise that I just heard?
[66:29.17]I can't get up there.
[66:33.31]That's another electrical part.
[66:34.67]I think that's how I get it, right?
[66:35.80]I have to turn the clock tower and everything.
[66:43.44]All right.
[66:44.82]Straight, left, right.
[66:56.75]E-storage room.
[66:57.77]I better be able to open that.
[66:59.45]Or I'll be livid.
[67:03.84]Go!
[67:07.16]No, no, no, no!
[67:08.00]Not right now!
[67:08.66]Not right now!
[67:09.20]Not right now!
[67:09.64]I need to heal right now!
[67:10.60]Where's my heal?
[67:14.00]Unnecessary!
[67:20.96]I can just... No!
[67:22.10]Just do it.
[67:23.18]Go.
[67:41.42]Oh, fuck.
[67:44.42]Okay.
[67:50.94]This is gonna bring me down... I need... a box room.
[67:56.72]We gotta go back down to the first floor.
[68:09.67]This'll...
[68:18.90]All the way down.
[68:29.63]All the way.
[68:37.12]Bathroom break room.
[68:44.50]I don't even... Just board it up, you know?
[68:46.68]Just board it up.
[68:47.50]I have a bunch of them.
[68:53.33]Wait, interrogation room opposite... I haven't been in here.
[68:55.63]I need a save point right now.
[69:09.74]It's a heart room.
[69:13.35]And this is a... this is a club.
[69:20.33]There's also a locker.
[69:24.89]I am O.O.M.
[69:33.47]What the hell is that?
[69:35.39]Box.
[69:35.73]Oh, I need a jewel.
[69:40.59]Don't touch anything.
[69:47.67]He's coming.
[69:48.10]He's coming.
[69:48.50]He's coming.
[69:48.78]He's coming.
[69:49.04]He's coming.
[69:49.34]He's coming.
[69:49.70]He's coming.
[69:52.42]Okay, I gotta get out of here.
[70:03.35]I gotta... I gotta get to a save point.
[70:20.83]Okay.
[70:25.49]I wish he wasn't here!
[70:26.61]Ugh!
[70:35.33]Okay.
[70:36.64]When confronted by an officer, he tried to escape by acting confused, but was arrested.
[70:40.44]A note he had on him was confiscated.
[70:45.10]It's not like everyone doesn't know who it is, but it's Justin Hansen, age 39, city resident.
[70:52.19]I'm frozen right now, right?
[70:53.87]6-2-11.
[70:58.60]This is a safe key.
[70:59.06]For second floor waiting room.
[71:02.68]6-2-11.
[71:02.74]There's a safe...
[71:16.47]Gunpowder.
[71:18.75]Just... That would do it all, right?
[71:22.87]All three of them.
[71:24.21]And that would give me some magnum ammo.
[71:31.55]I don't need the club anymore.
[71:43.77]Get rid of the key.
[71:48.77]find these okay I can pick up the box and then I gotta get the fuck out of here so I need a I need a plan out
[72:10.39]Up the stairs again.
[72:11.89]Which will bring me to here.
[72:14.13]And then... Out here through fire escape.
[72:18.21]Fire escape.
[72:20.43]Into... Watchman's room into break room.
[72:24.82]No.
[72:25.16]What's right there?
[72:27.76]Roof?
[72:29.18]Where am I right now?
[72:33.48]Where the fuck am I?
[72:34.32]Second floor, right?
[72:38.43]How do I... No.
[72:39.21]How do I get over there?
[72:47.88]I think I have to- I have to go that way.
[72:49.19]I have to go from the fire escape, right?
[72:50.47]Because there's no way I can get over here from here.
[72:53.87]Unless I- This doesn't lead me there, I don't think.
[72:57.35]Because that goes down to the... The garage, and then this would go up to the roof.
[73:04.58]But then I could go down... Okay.
[73:07.72]So I'm gonna go up to roof.
[73:09.76]No.
[73:09.98]Shit!
[73:10.72]Shit!
[73:14.76]I have to go up the stairs anyways, so we're gonna go out, we're gonna go up the stairs.
[73:18.10]So left, right, up stairs.
[73:26.87]OOOH!
[74:00.22]How did this turn into the best horror game I've ever played?
[74:03.79]I don't... But I need to fucking plan.
[74:06.65]Observation room.
[74:09.75]I need to... I can't open this door.
[74:11.41]I don't have the part.
[74:12.47]This is fucking unbelievable.
[74:20.88]I have to, like, go...
[74:52.21]That's just a reflection.
[75:08.92]He did make a hole.
[75:11.60]So... Press room... and then to the main hall.
[75:23.37]This game's gonna give me a heart attack.
[75:24.53]It actually is.
[75:25.09]I have to go for it.
[75:29.03]Through the hole he made in the wall there, down, and then into the main hall.
[75:37.46]Get the box?
[75:38.44]The box.
[75:43.46]I got the box, right?
[75:44.16]This thing?
[75:44.58]With the jewel in the middle?
[75:46.36]I didn't miss anything, right?
[75:47.22]I gotta just go for it.
[75:49.69]Okay.
[75:52.61]Okay.
[75:54.50]Bang on left.
[75:55.40]Press room.
[75:56.96]Sometimes you gotta just fucking sprint and if you take a hit, you take a hit.
[76:00.62]Left.
[76:01.30]Straight right.
[76:02.93]Go!
[76:12.69]Leads us to out right.
[76:14.23]Left.
[76:20.60]Left.
[76:24.28]And then right into the main hall.
[76:33.13]What is that noise?
[76:34.09]And why is he in the main hall?
[76:35.67]It's a sanctuary.
[76:36.59]You're not allowed here.
[76:47.35]No, what?
[76:52.42]I just need to save the game.
[77:01.26]I'll stop this, Lieutenant.
[77:05.96]I promise.
[77:31.30]I just want to go over there and save and I gotta take the jewel out.
[77:37.18]This must be stopped.
[77:41.83]Just in case I fuck myself over somehow.
[77:45.97]It's saved right here.
[77:46.83]I gotta get in that box!
[77:51.45]His weakness is his hat!
[77:52.59]Shoot it off!
[78:25.28]That was funny.
[78:25.78]That was very funny.
[78:27.58]But I can't... I don't have any comedy in me.
[78:29.78]That was very funny.
[78:42.11]Okay, I'm gonna go in the box now.
[78:45.51]Does it freeze when I go in the box?
[78:50.03]Time is frozen, right?
[78:59.90]Red jewel, large gear.
[79:05.45]He's not allowed to move in this stop time.
[79:06.83]We're going to make another herb.
[79:09.97]Combine this with a red.
[79:12.15]I got to do another big one.
[79:20.82]Red and then blue.
[79:24.08]Maybe not, though.
[79:24.84]That's a full heal.
[79:25.74]I don't know if it's... It's not necessary.
[79:28.98]I need to save these for, like, poison.
[79:30.92]That's a waste, because this is already a full heal.
[79:33.44]No.
[79:33.96]I'm holding on to the blue ones.
[79:35.82]That would be a mistake.
[79:36.44]It just would.
[79:36.81]Okay.
[79:38.71]Combine this with this.
[79:42.03]What's in it?
[79:45.73]Star's Badge.
[79:51.74]A special badge for RPD's Special Force Division stars, right?
[79:55.11]Okay.
[79:55.61]Oops, ammo.
[79:59.27]I'm not going to use it.
[80:00.07]I'm going to hold onto that key.
[80:02.13]I need the large gear.
[80:05.63]Let's make... I'm going to make some... I'm going to make some of this gunpowder, I think.
[80:12.10]Just because I can, right?
[80:15.56]Might as well just do it.
[80:20.74]Get a shitload of it.
[80:23.90]okay so I have to like look at that let me bring this back out so I think that's good power plant power panel part no no I don't think I need this yet
[80:53.35]Let's make sure our inventory is not stupid looking.
[80:58.33]Let's move this over here.
[80:59.75]Move this over here.
[81:01.65]A knife can be up there.
[81:02.47]That's fine.
[81:03.15]Let's get the heal this way.
[81:05.29]Move that down there.
[81:08.23]Miscellaneous items will go down here, like quest items.
[81:13.18]Ugh, I'm throwing up.
[81:14.26]Okay.
[81:19.46]Back to where I was before.
[81:29.04]One, two, three.
[81:36.44]Okay, now what the hell is this?
[81:41.82]Clip?
[81:44.95]USB dongle key, that's for the armory.
[81:56.89]Which is on the second floor.
[81:59.64]There it is.
[82:00.02]There's the PC.
[82:01.48]I can get the Lightning Hawk.
[82:04.26]If I open this door with the dongle.
[82:10.70]But... I need to... I'll go get it in a minute.
[82:18.59]I need to go to the clock tower.
[82:21.83]Gearbox...
[82:24.71]Am I gonna... What else do I need to bring up here?
[82:35.96]Is that gonna do it all?
[82:37.08]There's also this room too.
[82:47.09]Yeah.
[82:51.50]I gotta get rid of this guy.
[82:53.40]Is that like the joke of this whole game here?
[82:56.11]Is like you're gonna do the he doesn't know thing and he's just gonna follow me for the rest of the fucking game?
[83:13.25]Can I shoot him?
[83:15.42]I shot his hat off.
[83:16.32]Hold on.
[83:20.02]Jeremy.
[83:27.30]I can hurt him.
[83:28.02]I can... Go and punch him!
[83:32.43]Better get moving.
[83:34.45]Does this do anything?
[83:37.33]Okay, alright, alright, alright, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[83:40.65]He goes down on the knee.
[83:48.83]Um... I'm gonna go to the linen room.
[83:53.99]I'm gonna get the gun.
[83:54.73]We're gonna do this first.
[83:56.69]I need this shit.
[83:59.30]So we're gonna go second floor, library, lounge, linen room, out of linen room, star's office, armory, gun, out, shower room, no, out, down, right, in, here we go.
[84:14.93]Up.
[84:28.53]Wait!
[84:29.11]I have the diamond key still.
[84:31.21]Yes, I do.
[84:33.45]And I have the dongle.
[84:36.15]Yes.
[84:36.73]Let's go.
[84:44.32]So that brings us into there.
[84:45.28]And then we go down to the lounge, into the linen room.
[84:47.26]Let's cross this way.
[84:55.68]He's back.
[84:56.62]He's back already.
[84:58.10]This motherfucker is back already.
[85:03.38]Took this guy 15 goddamn seconds to come back to life.
[85:09.95]What's in here?
[85:13.39]There is gunpowder.
[85:20.73]And a portable safe.
[85:59.09]Okay, what's in here?
[86:07.08]Shit.
[86:09.90]There's too many things to do.
[86:12.18]There's too many things to do.
[86:13.74]Because that goes back up.
[86:17.98]That's the security deposit room.
[86:20.55]And then I think there's a pouch down in there.
[86:28.50]Okay, so I gotta make my way down there.
[86:38.45]So fucking cool.
[86:39.23]Okay, so what's the plan right now?
[86:43.49]The plan right now is to go out of the linen room into Star's office, PC dongle.
[86:58.09]Oh, motherfucker, no way!
[87:11.04]Are there any more?
[87:25.11]Out, and then right.
[87:30.96]He's right right now.
[88:03.42]I gotta go on that...
[88:39.11]Just put it in the fucking computer already.
[88:50.67]That's a loud noise!
[88:53.29]Oh fuck, he probably heard it.
[88:56.62]I can hear him running!
[88:58.34]I can hear him running.
[89:00.48]He's fucking sprinting.
[89:16.95]How you doing in that drab old station, hanging in there against old irons?
[89:19.93]Me?
[89:20.07]I just got back from a date with a hot chick.
[89:24.03]But you can guess what we have.
[89:26.13]Europe is amazing.
[89:26.91]One month is in no way enough to even scratch the surface.
[89:30.02]Maybe I'll extend my vacation for another six months.
[89:33.16]Barry, don't even think of joining me.
[89:36.02]I wouldn't want to make all the cute girls cry.
[89:38.20]Yeah, so you just leave the babes to me.
[89:40.04]Jill, if Claire tries to contact you, please let her know I'm okay.
[89:50.42]Just so I don't lose it.
[89:51.61]Give me the gun.
[89:55.69]So this is the Magnum.
[90:00.25]Nothing else in here, right?
[90:04.03]Okay.
[90:04.85]Got it.
[90:05.51]Do I need the key?
[90:06.69]Do I need to take the key out?
[90:09.40]Is there another computer?
[90:10.22]I don't have any room.
[90:17.40]That's it?
[90:17.76]Okay, no I do because this key's done.
[90:25.21]So grab dongle key, leave the office, take a right through the shower, down and then back to the main hall.
[90:37.74]No, wait.
[90:40.98]No, back to the clock tower.
[90:42.64]I can get up to the, okay.
[90:44.44]Perfect, perfect plan.
[90:48.67]Out of the armory, right through the showers, up the stairs,
[90:54.26]around the west storage, into the clock tower.
[90:58.78]I think.
[91:02.34]I think.
[91:20.59]One shotgun blast to his face.
[91:27.29]Anything else in this room, because I'm gonna have a... Come, that was the... Is he just opening doors?
[91:49.33]He's gonna find the right one eventually, and I'm gonna be in it.
[91:58.60]He's right outside.
[91:59.44]Is there a crouch?
[92:07.92]Is there another door that he's coming in from here?
[92:21.88]Why the fuck did this turn into, like, amnesia?
[92:29.76]He's gonna check in here Straight and then right through the shower There's a licker up top I can't run
[93:05.67]Anything else?
[93:20.49]Right to the shower.
[93:32.48]I don't know where he is.
[93:33.32]I'm gonna open the door and he's gonna be right in front of me.
[93:38.64]All right, I'm ready.
[93:56.25]He's right fucking here.
[94:02.21]He's holding the liquor on his shoulder.
[94:05.53]He may as well be.
[94:10.29]For the love of God.
[94:11.63]Out.
[94:23.45]Right.
[94:24.17]Straight.
[94:26.01]Game time.
[94:41.30]straight for the shower but okay
[95:17.35]Straight through.
[95:17.99]I don't have a lock.
[95:18.89]I don't have the dial lock for this.
[95:23.91]So I have to go out and then up.
[95:30.24]What was that?
[95:30.80]I don't know what that laugh was.
[95:36.16]Straight and then out.
[95:37.84]I don't have the dial lock.
[95:44.07]I missed it.
[95:44.61]I made a joke instead.
[95:49.13]Well, somebody's cheating, so I'm cheating.
[95:51.91]I'm going to open it.
[95:53.58]Cap?
[95:54.62]I'm just going to cheat.
[95:55.26]Who cares?
[95:58.52]Are there any liquors in here?
[96:00.04]Tell me yes or no.
[96:10.59]Straight ahead.
[96:16.95]Okay, I hear one.
[96:17.75]It's all just video game sound effects.
[96:19.97]It's not real.
[96:33.09]Okay.
[96:34.40]Out that door.
[96:38.44]It's not real.
[96:39.88]It's just video game sound effects.
[96:41.64]It's not going to hurt you.
[96:42.66]It's just designed to sound like this.
[96:46.34]and then bang a left and then go up the stairs I think now I'm gonna go down the stairs because there's a save point right there up down the stairs into the darkroom and okay sounds good to me
[97:13.65]So, out left, downstairs.
[97:15.85]Okay, time to go!
[97:34.01]You idiot!
[97:34.79]You're in my way!
[97:54.18]Oh my God, this game is incredible.
[97:56.96]Oh, 10 out of 10 acting.
[98:14.28]Okay.
[98:17.32]I'm gonna store the Magnum for now.
[98:23.63]What do I have in here?
[98:24.33]There's ammo.
[98:28.95]I'm gonna make some more bullets, maybe?
[98:30.95]No, I'm gonna save them.
[98:35.91]This game's making my back hurt.
[98:40.43]So I have this tool, I'm not gonna, I don't think I'm gonna do this.
[98:47.93]Dongle key, I'll store it.
[98:49.11]I have a heal, I have my knife that I'm not even fucking using.
[99:04.96]Thank God I have a save.
[99:13.27]Did I have any more film?
[99:15.17]I thought I did.
[99:16.41]Apparently not.
[99:17.07]Imagine if this game had VR.
[99:21.07]It would be un-fucking-bearable.
[99:26.44]So, now, because I ran downstairs, I can go into the locker terminals and put the next key on...
[99:34.57]I have a save point right here so I can just save Scumbit if I get hit in the face by like a wrench or something.
[99:39.60]And then take the stuff out.
[99:41.24]2-0, whatever they are.
[99:42.32]I have to look at them.
[99:44.90]I'm ready.
[99:46.00]Let's go put the other key on.
[99:49.15]And go get the other items that are in this room.
[99:55.15]Left.
[99:56.33]Left.
[99:57.05]Okay.
[99:57.35]Okay.
[100:08.79]You same idiot!
[100:09.75]The same idiot!
[100:15.03]Holy shit!
[100:15.93]What a mistake!
[100:20.98]What a mistake!
[100:28.14]It's all lickers!
[100:29.96]Just... Alright.
[100:35.68]So don't run down that hall.
[100:39.35]I'm gonna throw like a flashbang and get in.
[100:41.15]Yeah, save scum.
[100:46.29]You can call me a scumbag if you want.
[100:48.67]I'm going for it.
[100:51.37]That was this one right here, right?
[100:52.67]Yeah.
[100:57.57]Sorry, you can call me a scumbag.
[101:07.62]We're gonna go out there, get out there, flashbang.
[101:15.63]Hey!
[101:15.83]Hey, ugly!
[101:44.06]He's like peeking in the room.
[101:45.06]Hey, you can call me a scumbag all you want.
[102:02.76]Get.
[102:19.29]All right, eat shit.
[102:29.38]And I'm sick of dealing with you.
[102:30.48]I'm gonna make you dead forever.
[102:38.01]How am I gonna get out of here?
[102:45.36]I don't have any more flashbangs left.
[102:46.46]I'm stuck here.
[102:47.36]How am I gonna get out?
[103:01.04]He's too big to fit in this room.
[103:02.32]I'm safe in here.
[103:02.90]Okay, so what do we need to do?
[103:05.06]We need 203.
[103:05.52]That's a pouch.
[103:07.76]Get it.
[103:10.34]Fucking velociraptors, shut up.
[103:15.96]Good.
[103:19.09]Playing this on Hardcore... Can you imagine running into this guy for the first time on Hardcore, and maybe you didn't save for, like... Oh, stream's still... we good?
[103:35.29]Imagine not saving for, like, two hours and then fighting and seeing that guy for the first time.
[103:40.07]That'd be living hell.
[103:43.08]All right, we got 208.
[103:43.62]There's 103, right?
[103:47.15]108, 103 is a knife.
[103:47.87]Just open it.
[104:04.87]That looked like a little flash of internet issues.
[104:08.60]I think we're good.
[104:11.94]So just, like, replace this one.
[104:17.40]I'm gonna slash somebody with that one.
[104:21.69]Is it equipped?
[104:22.53]Yeah, this one's currently equipped.
[104:25.19]I need to heal in a minute here.
[104:26.65]I got the pouch.
[104:27.57]I'm good to go.
[104:28.69]Everything's loaded.
[104:31.14]Now what on earth am I going to do now?
[104:35.69]I'm gonna have to try to get back to the dark room.
[104:39.34]I think.
[104:46.22]Uh, audio isn't synced.
[104:49.76]Where's my, where'd my mouse go?
[104:53.02]What do you mean audio is not synced?
[104:59.44]Should be.
[105:02.82]Um...
[105:05.17]But I'm gonna I'll piss my pants if I if I don't do this right now So I'm gonna pee for the first time.
[105:09.40]I'll be right back pee break
[106:45.06]Eh?
[107:14.09]Oh, I needed that.
[107:17.17]I need that just glass of water and just... Hello, welcome back.
[107:31.58]I need a box of wine.
[107:33.48]No, I'm glad I don't have any wine tonight.
[107:37.52]You know, are you kidding me?
[107:38.18]That would just slow me down.
[107:39.34]I would probably die like five times to this guy.
[107:44.07]So... I have... I gotta get back up.
[107:53.05]Let me see.
[107:59.74]Back to the darkroom.
[108:00.56]Because I want to save it because I just got those items.
[108:04.18]And then... That part of the mission is completed.
[108:07.82]For me.
[108:08.96]So out.
[108:09.82]Around the corner left.
[108:11.35]I don't have any flashbangs.
[108:23.95]I could run straight... Just try to run straight through and through the hall, through the rest office.
[108:34.78]It might be worth it, because look at this.
[108:38.84]I ain't gonna get out here.
[108:40.08]They're both just sitting here waiting for me to open the door.
[108:46.83]Like, what the fuck?
[108:54.34]I miss variety Jerma, not normie Jerma.
[108:59.59]What?
[109:01.79]What does that mean?
[109:08.43]We just played the Dreamcast like two, three days ago.
[109:11.38]What the heck?
[109:14.96]All right.
[109:16.26]Here we go.
[109:18.82]Normie Jerma.
[109:22.83]Here we go.
[109:31.72]Yeah, I gotta kill them.
[109:33.19]I have to shoot them.
[109:34.61]This is not gonna happen.
[109:35.83]They have to die.
[109:43.23]They're blocking my path.
[109:53.57]He's gonna hit me through the door.
[109:57.56]Just shoot him!
[110:00.60]Did I hit him?
[110:15.37]Dead?
[110:16.39]Are they both dead?
[110:23.28]Okay, I think I'm gonna get through that door.
[110:26.28]Here we go.
[110:27.30]One, two, three!
[110:33.69]Back and left.
[110:42.41]Back in the main hall.
[110:47.59]Let's get a save.
[110:49.91]Perfect.
[110:52.27]Pretty good driving directions, I think.
[110:53.81]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[110:55.41]Okay.
[110:59.81]We are back in the main hall with fully loaded weapons.
[111:06.39]Saved game.
[111:07.01]Now.
[111:14.15]We need to go up.
[111:21.05]What was that safe?
[111:21.79]The safe is right here, isn't it?
[111:22.87]What was that combination?
[111:27.95]I got it.
[111:28.63]Yeah, I'm going to get this safe.
[111:29.71]So we're going to go up main hall into this room up here.
[111:32.81]Open the safe.
[111:35.23]It was 6, 12, 9 or something, right?
[111:44.48]And then from there, fire escape.
[111:49.94]Up.
[111:51.11]No, I can't go up from the fire escape, can I?
[111:53.83]From there, up from roof, through to Clock Tower.
[112:03.07]I'm ready.
[112:04.43]It's time.
[112:12.50]Oh, I can't wait till this motherfucker leaves me alone.
[112:19.49]Just flies around.
[112:22.89]Is time frozen when I use a safe?
[112:25.49]If it's not, this is going to be bad.
[112:40.08]Like, is he... Can he get in here?
[112:44.47]Okay.
[112:45.27]So it was left... What was it?
[112:48.63]I have it right here somewhere.
[112:49.49]Left 6, right 2, left 11.
[112:53.46]So 6, 2, 11.
[112:53.74]6, 2, 11.
[112:54.04]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[112:54.34]1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[112:54.84]Open up.
[112:55.42]Film canister.
[112:56.14]No.
[112:56.34]No.
[113:16.50]Custom part for the Matilda that reduces recoil and muzzle rise by redirecting propellant gas up and away from the barrel.
[113:26.73]Alright.
[113:29.71]Matilda's pretty decked out right now.
[113:33.71]Equipment can't believe that worked.
[113:36.53]When you use a safe, you... They're not telling me the numbers to go to, they're telling me how many notches in a direction.
[113:45.82]Alright, so out through here.
[113:50.00]Just all the way down through the whole hall.
[113:53.88]Up the stairs.
[113:56.57]Through the storage room.
[113:57.91]Let's just get up the stairs first.
[113:59.25]Here we go.
[114:08.83]Here, bang a left, go through.
[114:14.86]I thought he couldn't get in these rooms!
[114:19.05]What?!
[114:26.35]Oh, you asshole.
[114:31.19]Uh, somebody just gave five community subs.
[114:39.58]Oh, stop panicking.
[114:42.14]Just shoot him.
[114:50.03]Down to one knee, here we go, let's go.
[114:51.41]Did somebody just write N-V-A-M like Nevada?
[114:59.79]What are you, what?
[115:02.31]N-A, like what?
[115:04.36]Now we're picking states out now?
[115:07.68]First it was like, oh, N-A, oh, E-U.
[115:10.22]Now we're picking actual states out.
[115:17.56]Oh, like, oh, he's got real, like, fucking, like, M.A.
[115:21.92]We're going to pick the state now.
[115:24.02]What are the top players in Nevada?
[115:27.37]What's their aim like?
[115:28.29]Okay.
[115:42.39]Let's go.
[115:49.89]He's down on one knee, just get out.
[115:58.14]That takes us up to where I want to be.
[116:00.96]I have all the items I need, right?
[116:05.44]Alright, here we are.
[116:09.98]We should go, okay, east storage room now.
[116:13.34]And then there's the hall, into the clock tower.
[116:17.80]You better not fucking, you'll fade out.
[116:26.25]I knew it was him!
[116:27.03]No, it's not him.
[116:28.52]It looked just like him.
[116:41.44]I don't care.
[116:41.90]I don't care.
[116:43.26]I just need to get to where I need to go.
[116:44.89]I don't care.
[116:47.41]I don't care, okay?
[116:48.51]There's nowhere for him to break through a wall, right?
[117:00.49]There's no walls he can break through.
[117:01.79]Alright, fuck off.
[117:15.43]Get it in there.
[117:17.49]Turn it.
[117:17.77]Do whatever you need to do.
[117:18.43]Turn.
[117:28.16]And then I need to do it here too, right?
[117:37.71]Right here?
[117:38.03]That doesn't fit.
[117:48.29]Fuck.
[117:57.80]I guess I can just go up then.
[118:02.52]Where did that drop down?
[118:03.64]There's like a ladder thing that came down.
[118:07.17]We're here?
[118:12.35]Where the hell did that drop down?
[118:13.95]Am I just dumb?
[118:16.15]There it is.
[118:16.47]How do I get that open?
[118:37.96]That's a bell.
[118:38.68]Alright, so here's this thing.
[118:41.52]Small gear.
[118:43.46]Well, now that... I guess that makes sense.
[118:45.18]It wouldn't put the large gear in here.
[118:48.34]Turn that one.
[118:53.41]What does that do?
[118:57.15]I'm not entirely sure.
[118:59.17]It looks like it's running... I turned it on.
[119:11.71]So now this goes in the other one.
[119:13.49]And I should open and drop it down, maybe?
[119:15.33]Alright, so now that works.
[119:35.11]Well, if I was going to attract somebody over here, that's how you do it.
[119:42.23]There's the electrical part.
[119:44.17]I now have both of these.
[119:45.31]I was told to get them both.
[119:52.71]You break through that door, I swear to God.
[119:54.69]This should be two.
[120:07.73]There's an electronic part.
[120:10.85]Two of them.
[120:13.94]Okay, obtain electronic part, obtain power plant part.
[120:17.64]And now I can go back to the parking garage.
[120:20.82]And... Give me a second.
[120:28.65]I need the other one.
[120:29.63]So, what's the fastest way?
[120:31.21]I could go through here.
[120:34.73]Through and then down.
[120:38.59]Which would bring me here.
[120:40.34]Put me in the library.
[120:41.48]Okay.
[120:49.33]And then plus two for Leon.
[120:53.79]He made a funny joke.
[120:54.61]Yeah, I guess he did.
[120:57.33]So that would put me down here.
[121:00.74]I need to go from there to this library down.
[121:06.46]That brings to the west office.
[121:09.88]And I need to go down from... There's only one way to go and that's... Isn't that through the main hall?
[121:18.40]Can I go down from the main hall?
[121:21.10]Or is it easier for me to go through, for instance, from down here?
[121:26.84]So like from over here.
[121:32.56]I'm pretty sure I can get down there.
[121:34.08]Yeah, I can get down from here, right?
[121:39.30]Or maybe I can't.
[121:43.54]I'm doing some tuber commentary.
[121:52.93]Yeah, that's what I thought.
[121:54.53]So down here.
[121:57.35]So I'm going to get back to the main hall.
[121:59.39]I've done what needs to be done.
[122:04.29]So down the stairs, into the library, and then out to the main hall.
[122:12.44]Let's go for it.
[122:19.27]I'm so nervous right now.
[122:20.63]Because... Just... No.
[122:31.83]No.
[122:36.14]I gotta go this way.
[122:38.98]I need to go east storage room.
[122:41.42]Down.
[122:42.76]Down.
[122:43.96]Down.
[122:44.40]Okay.
[122:44.86]East storage room it is.
[122:47.62]And then is there...
[122:51.68]Okay, there is.
[122:53.42]The break room is right there.
[122:56.11]All right, straight left.
[123:00.09]Straight left.
[123:04.69]I'm just going to go out through there.
[123:09.29]Here we go.
[123:10.45]He's probably going to be right here.
[123:11.61]Just load up the guns just in case something happens.
[123:16.19]Straight all the way down, left, right.
[123:24.09]I wish I could peek.
[123:28.97]Let's go.
[123:38.69]Don't break through a door.
[123:39.53]Don't break through a door.
[123:40.27]Don't break through a door.
[123:41.77]Don't break out through, like, a door.
[123:50.52]Straight through.
[123:52.61]Don't break out through this door.
[123:58.14]And then down.
[124:02.64]Down brings me here.
[124:05.44]Down again.
[124:06.08]No.
[124:16.98]Fire escape.
[124:20.73]Down here, it brings me here.
[124:23.53]And then, I'm going out to the main hall.
[124:33.92]So from here I can... Yeah, no, I can't.
[124:37.86]I can't, I need... Because this is gonna bring me here and this is gonna... Press room?
[124:45.45]Bathroom?
[124:46.07]Break room?
[124:47.94]I can, I guess I could do it.
[124:48.94]I could do press room through, but there's so many aliens over there.
[124:57.80]We'll do that.
[124:58.45]Fuck it.
[125:07.11]So press room.
[125:14.36]So left, straight, left.
[125:25.47]Straight, left.
[125:57.51]Okay, I'm so compulsive right now.
[125:59.21]Around the corner.
[126:04.51]Hello!
[126:04.95]Alright, I made it, I made it, I made it, I made it, I'm good.
[126:10.71]Okay, we're safe.
[126:19.26]I got my storage unit in here, I got the save point right there, and now it's time to finish this.
[126:26.36]Give me the power panel parts.
[126:29.04]I have a heal.
[126:31.97]I'm alright.
[126:32.59]Just reload.
[126:33.27]I need some more handgun ammo.
[126:34.35]I might just make it.
[126:36.69]Yeah, I'm gonna make it.
[126:38.53]Why not?
[126:40.01]The hatch is sitting in here.
[126:40.97]Okay.
[126:48.64]Okay.
[126:54.45]Any more items?
[126:56.16]I don't think so.
[126:56.66]Maybe the dongle?
[126:57.52]Don't think so.
[127:01.82]So I got the two pieces.
[127:03.60]I got the two power pieces.
[127:06.66]Game is saved.
[127:07.42]Now let's do another part of the map stream.
[127:10.18]Let's go.
[127:10.56]I need to go down, so I have to go from here.
[127:17.51]This is not going to do anything for me, is it?
[127:20.41]Can I go down from there?
[127:35.14]Would you look at that?
[127:38.28]I made it here.
[127:41.90]Now where did these go?
[127:43.04]There's two of them.
[127:48.42]There's the parking garage, there's the card reader, there's the electronic door panel.
[127:54.51]So I have to go all the way down back into the jail, get that guy's key card, and then leave through the parking garage.
[128:10.88]Seems like a lot.
[128:17.85]Is that guy... That guy can't go underground, right?
[128:21.65]He can't.
[128:22.13]He'll get stuck.
[128:26.60]Second floor basement.
[128:28.00]Yeah, it's through here.
[128:28.78]Because remember, isn't the panel over here...
[128:36.77]The panel's all the way down here, and then he has, like, that reader.
[128:39.65]Fucking assholes.
[128:52.60]No.
[128:53.02]Okay, it's down here.
[128:56.60]There it is.
[128:57.00]Alright.
[128:59.74]Get key.
[129:00.66]I gotta get out of here, okay?
[129:02.84]Put in the power devices.
[129:06.14]Put them both in.
[129:08.32]And then we have to play one of these games.
[129:17.12]So it's gotta light up here, here.
[129:19.62]Hold on.
[129:31.79]So it's gotta come from here.
[129:37.19]No.
[129:37.51]Aren't these already lit up?
[129:51.94]No.
[129:56.78]No, it's gotta go across.
[129:59.69]Down, up.
[130:03.94]Gotta go from here.
[130:04.94]It can only come from that side.
[130:08.18]So it has to come from this side.
[130:13.42]So the question is how to get this.
[130:18.48]Like that.
[130:18.86]Okay, there's one.
[130:19.78]I gotta get the other one to do the same thing.
[130:26.76]There it is.
[130:27.26]Okay.
[130:30.02]Time to run!
[130:35.61]Toilet.
[130:37.23]Ben's memo!
[130:37.93]That would be our friend.
[131:04.35]First aid spray, good.
[131:07.25]And this is gonna activate some kind of event, so I gotta be ready to run the hell out of here and read the card and get the fuck out of the parking garage.
[131:25.40]Tape recorder?
[131:26.64]Yeah, but that doesn't explain the rumors about the orphanage.
[131:30.94]Cut off the interview.
[132:03.09]Interview transcript.
[132:05.15]Uh, we just heard it, so... Parking garage keycard.
[132:09.21]Take it.
[132:11.24]And escape the parking garage.
[132:13.28]This is where it gets fucking hairy, probably, because... These are all gonna open.
[132:24.76]Right?
[132:24.94]They're gonna open.
[132:30.56]Turn it off!
[132:31.34]Turn it off!
[132:38.66]What the fuck am I- do I have a grenade?
[132:40.76]No!
[132:49.65]Just get out of my way.
[133:11.39]Get the fuck down, lady!
[133:20.43]Which way is it?
[133:21.28]This way.
[133:21.72]How's my health?
[133:25.46]I'm okay.
[133:31.92]Go.
[133:45.46]Come on, Ada, kill him!
[133:47.20]Get rid of this guy!
[133:50.46]He's not gone.
[133:58.26]He's gonna come back and the same shit's gonna go over again.
[134:01.72]See?
[134:01.93]He's alive.
[134:13.81]He's unkillable.
[134:15.09]He's not dead.
[134:23.27]We didn't see him die on screen.
[134:24.61]It means he's still alive.
[134:25.63]Ridiculous.
[134:49.22]Oh, okay.
[134:53.12]I need to see him dead.
[134:54.78]No, guys.
[134:55.30]That's not how this works.
[135:03.30]What else we got?
[135:04.12]I need... I'm okay with healing.
[135:06.64]I need shotgun bullets.
[135:09.55]I need an upgrade to the shotgun.
[135:11.07]It's just a standard shotgun.
[135:20.69]That was crazy.
[135:27.38]At least I can have, like, a sigh of relief.
[135:29.32]That I don't have to worry about that guy following me everywhere I go for the last hour.
[135:35.69]Talk with Ada.
[135:40.79]How do I talk to Ada?
[135:43.91]Ada?
[135:46.25]Ada, can we talk?
[135:46.95]Ada?
[135:55.10]Being outside just feels so good.
[135:56.06]Consultation.
[135:57.12]There's the gun store.
[135:57.94]Is he gonna be in here?
[135:59.56]Alright, at this stage he's probably gone.
[136:30.62]Where the hell are we going?
[136:33.84]Yes, yes, come on.
[136:34.72]Who are you?
[136:36.04]And what are you doing here?
[136:37.11]Shotgun.
[137:01.17]No, I don't think he's in here.
[137:03.02]He stops you at the door.
[137:14.37]Are we supposed to be looking around?
[137:15.97]Investigating?
[137:17.47]Sure, I will.
[137:18.69]That's a grenade.
[137:20.89]I'll take a grenade.
[137:23.09]That is a long barrel.
[137:25.32]I did just mention shotgun upgrade and how I haven't found one and now here's a shotgun upgrade.
[137:30.46]Custom part for the W870 that ups its max capacity to eight.
[137:34.92]Less spread makes each shot more powerful.
[137:37.48]Well, that sounds pretty good to me.
[137:42.38]And it gives you eight shots, good.
[137:45.13]Nice, okay.
[137:49.21]Fancy.
[137:53.54]Can I take out my flashlight?
[137:57.06]Only five rounds in the gun store.
[138:01.24]No, come on.
[138:05.78]I'm not gonna hurt you.
[138:06.58]I said don't move.
[138:08.42]Who are you?
[138:08.84]I'm just passing through.
[138:10.26]I'm gonna ask you to lower that weapon.
[138:11.72]Like hell you are.
[138:13.12]You're gonna turn around and go right back out the way you came in.
[138:20.15]I think your daughter needs help, sir.
[138:22.41]Don't tell me how to deal with my daughter.
[138:26.19]What are you doing here?
[138:29.13]No!
[138:29.81]Wait!
[138:30.91]Step aside.
[138:32.29]We need to terminate her before she turns.
[138:35.16]Terminate?
[138:38.28]She's gonna bite him in the back.
[138:39.44]No original voice actor either, what the fuck?
[139:05.91]And by the way, what are you doing here?
[139:11.26]Mom?
[139:32.55]by his fucking ear is going to rip off.
[139:34.51]He's sleeping, buddy.
[139:36.47]Okay?
[139:39.60]And I'm going to put you to bed too, okay?
[139:42.60]See, I'll get away for the touching moment here.
[139:49.20]Aww.
[140:02.63]No, it didn't happen.
[140:06.39]Oh, wait.
[140:06.83]Oh, fuck.
[140:10.67]Okay.
[140:11.41]Oops.
[140:32.35]Helping people like them?
[140:34.17]That's why I joined the force.
[140:35.47]I thought he was going to get bit and eaten behind the door.
[140:43.10]My mission is to take down Umbrella's entire operation.
[140:48.16]We may not make it out.
[140:51.16]Whatever it takes to save this city, count me in.
[140:56.55]That was poorly timed with me doing... I thought it was going to be him screaming because we muffled screams from behind the door like he... Like she ate him.
[141:10.65]All right, listen.
[141:11.15]What are you doing here?
[141:21.57]I wasn't trying to make that like a joke I'm going look I'm going off the original game in the original game that happened to that guy except there was no daughter it was just the guy I thought that was going to happen again this is supposed to be a remake of the second game
[142:02.27]That game's older than most of chat.
[142:03.81]Yeah, it is.
[142:04.31]Now it is.
[142:10.19]This is interesting.
[142:10.99]Okay, I thought there was a...
[142:35.77]I thought you just walked off the edge.
[142:39.19]I was looking over at Chad and I glanced over here.
[142:42.53]Now let's go.
[142:43.49]We have just gone all the way down.
[143:07.30]Can't imagine a real scientist being down here.
[143:09.30]According to HQ, this leads right into Umbrella's secret facility.
[143:13.79]Come on.
[143:14.91]Sewers are run by the city.
[143:16.69]How could they have a facility without the authorities knowing?
[143:20.05]Welcome to corporate America.
[143:21.73]Umbrella's controlled Raccoon City for years.
[143:29.00]Why do I have to take the lead the whole time?
[143:36.44]First impressions of the game, I think it's fucking great.
[143:40.70]No, sorry about the f-word.
[143:42.76]I meant to say flip.
[143:47.46]It's gonna be that guy, the tyrant's gonna be back.
[143:51.87]That's why you check every corner.
[143:56.99]I told you, if you don't die on screen, you don't actually die.
[144:08.88]Okay, well that was a... I think that was a trash moving.
[144:16.19]Somebody dumped some trash down here.
[144:23.75]I told you I played the first second game.
[144:26.47]You know, you have to say it like that now.
[144:27.75]I played the first second one.
[144:31.35]Okay, I got heals.
[144:32.05]I got two full heals.
[144:34.23]I wonder if it's worth taking out the lightning hawk for this, because I only have...
[144:39.05]Eleven bullets for it.
[144:44.63]Hmm.
[144:45.75]Maybe.
[144:46.10]Although, I kind of feel like I'll need these at some point later.
[144:57.56]Ancient Greek Germa?
[144:58.78]What are you talking about?
[145:00.70]No, no, don't even take it.
[145:02.02]Let's go.
[145:02.38]I can kill this thing and not take one point of damage.
[145:09.15]So is Ada still with me?
[145:12.29]Or did she end up leaving?
[145:16.75]It's gonna, like, snowball down the whole hallway, isn't it?
[145:20.33]Well, there's nothing else here.
[145:27.59]Ada?
[145:28.80]Coming?
[145:40.37]Alright, you're filling me with ammo.
[145:53.94]She's still coming, right?
[145:56.08]Again?
[145:57.30]It's not too late to turn back, Leon.
[146:00.49]No chance.
[146:01.67]You're stuck with me to the end.
[146:03.72]Alright, here it comes.
[146:05.94]That was a safe checkpoint, so this is definitely something going on right now.
[146:10.75]I guess it is.
[146:11.31]I got two full heals.
[146:14.99]Nine shotgun shots.
[146:15.67]She's gonna wave by and I'm gonna have to fight this thing.
[146:36.08]Alright.
[146:39.25]And I... What?
[146:50.35]Oh.
[146:51.27]I'm controlling it now.
[146:52.39]Does it dodge?
[147:03.56]Apparently.
[147:04.40]Can I shoot behind me or something?
[147:11.74]Oh my god.
[147:13.11]Shoot it?
[147:14.37]Yep.
[147:14.57]Blow it up.
[147:14.89]Does it hurt you?
[147:16.19]Alright.
[147:17.99]Hell yeah.
[147:18.41]Got two grenades.
[147:19.29]Looking good.
[147:38.75]So I've made... I'm kind of stuck down here.
[147:44.11]Unless there's something... Oh.
[147:50.20]Hey, thanks for the ladder!
[147:53.86]Was that the... I was kind of expecting a fight there.
[147:59.79]I guess it was just a fun, interesting thing to see on the video camera.
[148:07.18]Who flushed a grenade in the toilet?
[148:14.38]Somebody trying to pull, like, a prank.
[148:15.62]Alright, where to?
[148:25.53]Down in the underground lab.
[148:29.89]So let me get this straight.
[148:31.61]Umbrella sells monsters like that to who?
[148:35.07]Our military?
[148:36.76]Somebody else's?
[148:38.30]Oh, it's not looking.
[148:39.16]No, it's fine.
[148:39.82]It's good.
[148:40.12]That's just a stain.
[148:40.90]They sell the viruses that make them.
[148:42.74]And Annette is who makes the viruses.
[148:45.56]Scary as that alligator was, Annette is far more dangerous.
[148:48.67]To me.
[148:48.95]All right, so we've made it underground.
[149:00.52]So... What do you want me to do now, Ada?
[149:07.52]Is this where- when- is this where part waves- when are we gonna part waves?
[149:16.15]The save point.
[149:18.83]Two in succession.
[149:22.13]No boxed up.
[149:27.26]Interestingly enough.
[149:31.15]New character.
[149:31.71]Migraine doing?
[149:32.31]Yeah, migraine's good.
[149:34.07]Just a little tired, froggy from it.
[149:37.41]I'm good.
[149:38.81]Hey!
[150:07.17]She should cause like a little fire.
[150:09.41]Oh yeah?
[150:09.59]I'm gonna burn this!
[150:10.27]It didn't do anything.
[150:10.99]You could've- Do I play as Ada?
[150:11.71]We character switching here?
[150:12.97]We are character switching now.
[150:35.44]What happened to my guns?
[150:36.02]Time to play as Ada.
[150:37.52]What do you have?
[151:09.01]Can I just steal all the stuff on my character?
[151:13.77]Because, I mean, for real, nine bullets in a nine millimeter.
[151:17.59]You're essentially, this is the worst weapon I could possibly have right now.
[151:22.76]So this is broken, messed up.
[151:25.82]Let me just check around, because down here is a ladder.
[151:28.80]But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[151:33.38]Go up.
[151:35.08]I don't want to miss bullets.
[151:36.54]Especially at this stage in the game here.
[151:42.73]Nothing, right?
[151:43.83]Nothing?
[151:44.35]Okay.
[151:44.95]We're just gonna go up the stairs.
[151:46.17]Yeah, just throw a blanket on him.
[151:52.64]He'll be fine.
[151:53.16]Oh, a price scanner!
[152:10.08]Pair prices.
[152:11.32]Use the EMF visualizer to track wiring and hack electronic equipment.
[152:15.56]Hack electronic equipment.
[152:18.70]Okay.
[152:18.84]Oh, it says on my app this is $15 less than Target.
[152:26.55]Turn it off?
[152:26.99]Turn it off.
[152:46.07]Am I not supposed to climb that?
[152:48.45]Wait, I was supposed to turn it on.
[152:53.53]Uh... Why would I want to turn it on?
[152:57.20]Wouldn't I want to climb up there?
[153:04.36]Oh, I get it.
[153:05.26]I can do both.
[153:05.84]I get it.
[153:06.16]I thought I could just climb up with it off.
[153:14.04]Candy from a baby.
[153:16.91]Watch out, don't burn yourself.
[153:24.53]Wait.
[153:25.39]Hackable object.
[153:27.62]Oh no, those are just bugs.
[153:29.10]No, but there's a wire there.
[153:30.16]Alright, we're gonna get... Hackable?
[153:40.67]Not hackable.
[153:42.79]Hackable.
[153:57.05]Okay.
[153:59.41]Now what?
[154:01.88]Go on.
[154:05.27]We are in... There's only one way to go.
[154:08.23]Straight, but there's probably stuff.
[154:10.64]There is something.
[154:11.48]September inspection.
[154:13.78]I already put in a request last week, but we absolutely must have a replacement ID wristband.
[154:19.30]We need one to gain access to certain areas of the main facility.
[154:23.48]In other words, me and my crew can't get to the places we need to in order to do our job, so I don't want to hear anyone accusing us of slacking off.
[154:30.50]So we got to get an ID wristband to get in certain rooms, I think.
[154:33.72]Certain doors.
[154:37.35]Nothing else here.
[154:38.07]I'm not even gonna fight this guy.
[154:39.50]Why would I?
[154:40.06]Just checking for items.
[154:45.20]Nothing.
[154:47.66]Okay.
[154:48.08]Well, let's get the fuck out of here.
[154:51.79]I can't.
[154:55.93]Hackable door.
[155:00.75]It is.
[155:07.41]Sir, you're annoying.
[155:08.41]Get away.
[155:11.33]Alright.
[155:16.64]Okay, looks like I can go through here.
[155:19.14]Let's explore a little bit.
[155:24.00]Handgun ammo?
[155:27.72]Good.
[155:29.22]Who are you?
[155:31.86]And I must say, what are you doing here?
[155:44.35]Whoa!
[155:46.79]Everything's fine.
[155:47.31]The lift?
[155:50.84]Where's the box?
[155:51.68]I don't want to play Find the String!
[155:56.76]Give me?
[156:14.57]Got it.
[156:15.67]Now... That's good.
[156:19.21]I can use it now.
[156:20.53]Okay.
[156:27.02]Definitely picked that shit up.
[156:29.62]What else is over here?
[156:33.20]Some flashbang.
[156:35.84]Alright, I have activated the lift.
[156:42.02]What's that move you just did?
[156:43.66]My god.
[156:44.24]This freaks me out.
[156:45.84]Shit!
[156:51.39]I thought I had an opportunity to get through you.
[157:01.21]Two of you on me at the same time?
[157:02.76]Really?
[157:08.72]God damn it.
[157:18.73]Okay, back out here.
[157:21.01]Where the fuck is... Alright, we're good.
[157:31.14]Let's go.
[157:34.97]You know, wiggling does nothing.
[157:36.55]It doesn't matter.
[157:37.79]I have to just try.
[157:38.91]There she is.
[157:47.08]This lady's been... What did she... What?
[157:51.46]This lady just disappeared!
[157:53.08]She walked through the wall!
[157:54.14]Bullets or anything?
[157:58.53]No... Where did she go?
[158:19.03]What the hell?
[158:20.09]That's a new- That's music.
[158:21.55]That's music.
[158:22.59]That's- He's back!
[158:23.27]I told you he was back!
[158:25.93]I told you he was back.
[158:27.21]I told you he was back.

[161:55.05]So this is connected to here.
[161:58.91]With the new wristband that's just arrived, we can finally begin our survey of the demolition area.
[162:05.43]As to the report from the other day about the incinerator, it's nothing really, probably just a large piece of leftover trash.
[162:10.63]I'll go take a look myself after I wrap up the report.
[162:15.63]Wristband.
[162:17.01]We can finally do our survey.
[162:19.71]The incinerator.

[162:32.01]That's activating this.
[162:35.57]That's the incinerator.
[162:37.99]Alright.
[162:38.77]I know what I have to do.

[162:52.44]So let me take a look.
[163:00.39]I gotta lock him in there.

[168:30.65]So, I have to do the incinerator unlock the door puzzle.
[168:36.30]Which I was wondering, I knew what the hell these were here for.
[168:39.02]This is Chuck E. Cheese.

[169:14.93]I was standing right in front of it, wasn't I?
[169:16.19]Yeah, I was.
[169:20.48]It was a lever, right.

[170:09.33]What's wrong with my brain?
[170:10.69]What?
[170:14.57]Why can I not do this?
[170:15.73]I just had- What?

[170:23.06]Where is it going?
[170:24.40]What the fuck am I doing?
[170:27.38]I did every puzzle in like 12 seconds and now I'm stuck on the fucking find the strings one.
[170:32.47]I'm gonna lose again.
[170:44.06]Yeah, I lost again Wait leon oh what
[171:18.42]Because I'm looking for orange, and it's not orange.
[171:23.61]You know what I mean?
[171:24.25]Like, my brain is like, oh, the one, it's orange.
[171:26.47]But yellow, whatever, and it's not.
[171:28.21]It's the one, it's the blue still, but it has the yellow in it.
[171:30.73]I don't know about the inspection.
[171:33.75]Let's go.
[171:44.80]Don't listen to your brain.
[171:46.38]I know, I shouldn't.
[171:55.27]Alright.
[171:56.07]Come and lock the door again.
[171:57.07]Then I'm gonna play chutes and ladders with myself.
[172:05.74]It's not there.
[172:06.32]I'm going to shoot this lady.
[172:28.00]Let's get the hard one first.
[172:36.76]Alright, let me out.
[173:01.09]Now, I got the ID card.
[173:08.61]But, although, uh... Scary guy is still around.

[173:19.90]Say what?
[173:21.26]Oh, shit.
[173:22.06]Okay, so this is where I need to go.
[173:24.76]Your ID is authorized until October 1st.
[173:29.14]Please return before this date.
[173:31.64]Not gonna happen.
[173:33.86]Alright.

[173:40.83]Tyrant.
[173:44.83]Oh wait, I need this though, don't I?
[173:52.53]It took me longer to put that in than to do some of the puzzles in the game.
[174:12.90]All right, come on, Ada.
[174:13.88]Let's go.
[174:14.26]I just got, like, shot in the face.
[174:21.26]Enough.
[174:22.56]He shot me right in my mouth.
[174:24.70]The game is over.
[174:26.59]You lost.
[174:30.39]Tell me.
[174:32.37]Is your husband still alive?
[174:35.23]Or did you kill him so you could take credit for G?
[174:38.61]Interesting theory.
[174:42.87]You gonna try to stamp me out?
[174:44.59]Oh.
[174:44.65]I felt that one.
[174:45.37]That hurts.
[175:14.51]How are you supposed to leave it in?
[175:16.30]Until you get to a doctor.
[175:19.24]Now I get to stand up as Leon.
[175:34.40]Alright.
[175:39.50]I've got my HP recovery jacket on.
[175:57.19]Now I have to fight Tyrant again.
[176:12.22]Hack complete.
[176:12.96]Find Ada.
[176:14.56]So I just gotta go through up there into the incinerator.
[176:19.58]Sounds like fun.
[176:21.56]What do I have for health?
[176:24.62]Caution.
[176:25.42]I'm okay.
[176:25.84]I got plenty of heals.
[176:28.40]Although I need the wristband, don't I?
[176:29.67]Do I just have to go through the exact same thing that she just did?
[176:38.35]No, this is broken.
[176:43.04]I don't have a hackable weapon.
[176:51.30]Oh right, she activated this again, okay.
[177:01.54]I do not just show I need that save.
[177:04.38]Okay, good.
[177:07.22]Perfect.
[177:16.57]So I just realized something.
[177:21.29]I'm getting to like the end of the game, right?
[177:23.34]Like I've got probably maybe like an hour or so, hour or two left in the game, right?
[177:31.78]No.
[177:35.26]About two hours, probably, maybe?
[177:42.10]Poison, right?
[177:45.10]Toxins?
[177:46.72]Where's the toxic enemy?
[177:55.23]Interesting.
[177:59.14]Alright, let's get it saved.
[178:00.57]We're good.
[178:00.99]I don't think I have to take anything.
[178:06.69]Not... No, I know I'm not at the end of the game right now, but I'm just saying, as of how far I've progressed, I'm surprised it's been... It's either about to happen, or it just might not happen.
[178:17.78]No talks are getting me so far.
[178:21.66]Nothing in the sandbag.
[178:22.64]It seems to drop down.
[178:33.96]This dickhead's gonna be down here.
[178:35.56]Alright, more bullets.
[178:36.64]Good.
[178:42.16]Just progress through.
[178:43.26]Watch out for the... Monsters are gonna come from the ocean.
[178:46.11]You can already tell.
[178:49.91]Tyrant's gonna show up.
[179:01.79]Two paths.
[179:02.39]We got left or right.
[179:06.33]I guess I'm going to just look left first.
[179:08.86]And I'm going to sneeze.
[179:09.74]And I'm sorry.
[179:10.28]I can't.
[179:10.96]I've got to.
[179:13.48]There's something here.
[179:19.63]Ow.
[179:21.85]Shit.
[179:23.23]I thought there was a monster right here.
[179:33.56]Okay.
[179:33.82]Anybody in the laundry?
[179:43.75]Don't think so.
[179:44.51]I knew I'd see you eventually.
[179:52.57]Son of a bitch.
[180:08.50]It's HUNK!
[180:09.76]I found HUNK!
[180:14.50]USS Digital Video Cassette.
[180:16.96]Sure, I'll take it.
[180:19.76]Is that actually HUNK?
[180:31.71]Alright, we- up here, I can bang a right, I can bang a- let's go right.
[180:38.75]Treatment facility is locked.
[180:41.79]Let's try this door over here.
[180:46.49]Electronic part.
[180:49.21]Well, okay.
[180:50.07]Uh... Well, I guess... I'm gonna have to kill this guy.
[181:09.45]Shit.
[181:12.82]Shit.
[181:15.14]I kinda need to go over there, don't I?
[181:16.56]Unless there's no... ...plug socket.
[181:20.26]I mean, I could go down there, but that's where I came from.
[181:25.55]Put it back in.
[181:26.01]I need to go across this.
[181:50.68]Oh, fuck.
[181:52.44]Fuck.
[181:54.66]Uh, it's a locked door?
[181:58.59]Just have to go this way.
[182:01.67]Eventually I'll probably find another one of those plugs.
[182:10.84]That's... a knife?
[182:14.68]No, I wanna... no grenade.
[182:16.22]Knife.
[182:16.86]Take the knife out.
[182:25.71]New items.
[182:27.37]New.
[182:27.73]Is he coming down here?
[182:34.60]Lower water way?
[182:35.60]Oh, sure.
[182:44.56]This guy just exploded when he went in the water.
[182:49.17]Is this death?
[182:58.42]One of those valves.
[183:05.42]Wasn't that one?
[183:05.90]I needed one of these earlier, didn't I?
[183:07.14]Yeah, I need it.
[183:11.05]Okay.
[183:11.43]One of those T-valves.
[183:16.13]Maybe I'll get one and be able to keep it and bring it back.
[183:25.56]What the hell was that?
[183:35.16]Did you see that?
[183:35.64]There's something right here.
[183:36.36]What is that?
[183:43.26]That's a new enemy type.
[183:44.30]I don't know what it is.
[183:44.90]It's a blob.
[183:48.58]What is that?
[184:04.69]Oh, shit.
[184:18.31]Bye.
[184:21.23]See you later.
[184:22.53]I want nothing to do with you.
[184:25.73]Toxic?
[184:26.93]No.
[184:31.08]This is where Ada was, right?
[184:34.56]No.
[184:40.38]There's an Umbrella Corporation logo.
[184:52.23]Sheeto?
[184:55.65]Search not completed.
[184:56.75]Yeah, well... There's a giant monster over there.
[185:03.69]I can't search over there yet.
[185:08.05]Okay, I desperately needed those.
[185:12.56]This is where Ada fell, and that was water down there.
[185:15.64]So, I'm gonna drain the water.
[185:17.22]Where'd she go?
[185:25.60]No, I don't know what this is.
[185:27.67]Another door combination.
[185:30.81]Copy of emails.
[185:33.57]There are alarms going off all over Nest.
[185:35.28]I don't know what's going on, but I can hear gunfire and I can't reach my section chief.
[185:40.42]We're trapped.
[185:41.38]Please send help as soon as possible.
[185:43.60]The situation here is dire.
[185:44.76]Nest has been contaminated with the virus.
[185:47.16]It's unbelievable.
[185:49.10]Failsafe system didn't activate at all.
[185:50.74]Is this the work of outsiders?
[185:52.04]I can't imagine who else could it be, but why?
[185:55.56]Mayor and Kim are dead.
[185:57.24]I can't stop coughing.
[185:58.70]Why won't you answer me?
[186:00.90]You, it was all... You, it was you all along.
[186:07.76]Yep.
[186:08.54]Okay, let's take a look.
[186:13.41]Anything else in here that's worth taking?
[186:25.95]Okay.
[186:28.81]It was me.
[186:31.81]No, me.
[186:45.15]There she is.
[186:45.57]Save Ada.
[186:45.81]There's bullets in here.
[187:14.25]Alright, is there a safe point anywhere?
[187:17.09]Yes, there is.
[187:17.99]Thank... God.
[187:22.08]Do you like when I look at you?
[187:23.94]You know what I mean?
[187:25.68]What's the word?
[187:26.18]Do you like when I look over here and look at you right in the eye?
[187:31.88]Yeah?
[187:32.50]No?
[187:37.70]Sewer's pamphlet.

[189:12.99]Store that.
[189:16.49]Keep this on me.
[189:17.37]Keep the grenades on me.
[189:19.62]Get rid of the tape.
[189:26.46]Alright, save it again.
[189:33.75]Put away that VHS tape.
[189:35.17]You're not going to use it anymore.
[189:40.00]So, I can go out here.
[189:44.02]But what's this?
[189:45.64]Nice map, thank goodness.
[189:49.13]Treatment monitor room.
[189:51.19]Garbage room.
[189:54.69]Treatment pool room.
[189:57.33]Let's just keep going.
[190:10.47]I don't know if I can go down here yet.
[190:12.71]This needs to be drained.
[190:14.85]So no access to this area.
[190:20.35]Unless... Let's do it.
[190:37.47]This takes me to... across.
[190:41.52]This way, treatment floor room.
[190:42.64]Let's go.

[193:57.44]Not cheating at all.
[193:59.87]Well, sometimes you have to chat.
[194:01.59]Chat?
[194:01.87]I don't know.
[194:02.43]Chat cheating is not the same as regular cheating.
[194:05.95]It's not.
[194:10.68]I'm gonna save it.
[194:12.70]I don't wanna do that shit again.
[194:24.28]If this was regular cheating, I would say, yeah, you're probably right.
[194:28.47]But we're not talking about regular cheating.
[194:29.91]I'm gonna call it helpful guidance.
[194:34.55]Helpful chat guidance.
[194:36.07]You like when I look at you, don't you?
[194:48.98]Alright.
[194:49.98]Got the improved shotgun piece.
[194:55.81]I think these guys should still be on the ground.
[194:59.06]Where do I go if I get down?
[195:00.28]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[195:00.84]To the water.
[195:05.56]Here.
[195:05.98]Yep, they're still on the ground.
[195:07.68]Good.
[195:08.12]Water has... I already looked down there.
[195:12.55]There's nothing.
[195:13.15]This just brings me back out.
[195:17.31]Here.
[195:20.52]So I gotta go.
[195:21.50]I don't have that item yet.
[195:22.96]So I have to go this way.
[195:24.79]Oh, damn it.
[195:27.73]Do I have to go that way, or can I just... Stay there.
[195:33.93]Hold on.
[196:06.78]Are you actually still alive?
[196:19.97]No, it's dead.
[196:27.31]Alright.
[196:29.23]So now, this is taking me back around.
[196:31.55]I don't...
[196:33.72]This is the lift.
[196:39.01]Does the dot... No, I gotta... Where do I have to go here?
[196:53.90]I have no idea.
[197:02.90]I haven't gotten any new items that I can bring me where.
[197:11.47]Where have I not been?
[197:12.67]Let me just go up here and see.
[197:16.51]No, no, no, no.
[197:17.33]I want to zoom in.
[197:18.05]I don't want to change... Oh my god.
[197:19.83]Okay.
[197:27.96]Where is break room that's locked?
[197:30.22]Lock door...
[197:32.51]Is there an electronic part or something I can do over here?
[197:36.85]Treatment pool room.
[197:38.27]Ada has to be saved.
[197:57.64]I really just kind of don't know.
[198:01.18]I walked around in a circle and I didn't get any other useful items.
[198:10.87]What if I lower?
[198:12.97]There's the T-bar slot, I didn't get it.
[198:17.31]Can I go in here?
[198:22.10]Maybe I gotta go through this way, maybe.
[198:23.76]Let me just see if that's possible.
[198:33.65]Is that possible?
[198:41.05]This dermis sounds like he's getting a little rowdy.
[198:44.11]What do you mean, rowdy?
[198:53.12]So this brings me down to here.
[199:01.67]Which means, let's see, if I can go through this, then I might be able to just walk this way?
[199:09.75]This motherfucker's back, too.
[199:11.30]Shit.
[199:12.20]Yeah, I agree.
[199:23.38]Just going this way... This is open.
[199:28.52]And then...
[199:35.02]Yeah, down here.
[199:36.62]Alright, I got it.
[199:43.60]Damn it.
[199:49.07]I need a... Where is that thing?
[199:55.25]Fuck.
[200:00.04]Alright, I'm gonna go back up.
[200:08.20]Because this is where I was before.
[200:09.30]This is where I ended up last time.
[200:18.29]So... There we go.
[200:25.05]Bingo.
[200:25.35]Right there.
[200:25.69]Alright.
[200:28.59]Straight down there.
[200:29.13]Alright.
[200:29.35]I got it.
[200:30.77]But... Let me save it.
[200:34.03]Maybe... No.
[200:34.47]I shouldn't even... Why save it?
[200:37.63]I just walked in a circle.
[200:40.01]Why would I need to save it?
[200:46.75]Well, there's another full heal if I... a full poison heal, if I'm so inclined to do it.
[200:56.56]There's the plunger!
[201:00.04]Well, now I know where that goes.
[201:06.24]ID wristband required for cable call.
[201:08.84]ID wristband required.
[201:09.84]Some more documents.
[201:18.04]Delivery receipt.
[201:20.38]The item below has been delivered to the location specified in your order.
[201:23.68]Heat-resistant safe times one.
[201:25.16]The combination is written on the side of the safe in chalk.
[201:28.80]Please remember to erase it before you use it.
[201:30.96]It's okay because chat guidance mode helped.
[201:34.61]And now I got it.
[201:39.24]Tell you what, I got it anyways.
[201:41.76]Now I can go plug that thing in and use it in the two places I know where it needs to be used.
[201:46.47]We're going to go to the first one.
[201:50.43]Which is out here and then around and down, down, down, down, down, down.
[201:56.67]I'm going to save it.
[202:00.27]Chad is spoiling the game.
[202:01.79]I wouldn't call that a spoiler.
[202:05.43]Got it.
[202:09.84]I guess it's kind of hard to spoil a game that technically released, like, 18 years ago.
[202:16.19]And that I've seen.
[202:17.99]Like, I knew what that was.
[202:24.03]I'm going to store these.
[202:24.77]I guess I could do another...
[202:40.15]Maybe just another red and green?
[202:45.94]No, I don't need it.
[202:54.57]I'll just hoard them for a little while.
[202:57.41]That leaves me with time to go out.
[203:00.61]And now I need to go... I want to go to that first one.
[203:05.91]The original one.
[203:10.67]Where is this?
[203:11.21]What the hell is all this shit?
[203:15.03]Alright, electronic part.
[203:16.21]I need three of these.
[203:29.58]Well, that one has to go over here.
[203:30.80]Is it going to do anything when I do this?
[203:33.53]Like, will it activate?
[203:35.57]No.
[203:36.41]I'm going to take it because I can use that in the bridge.
[203:41.41]Pretty sure the rook and knight are on the same wall and the bishop and queen aren't next to each other.
[203:46.23]The queen and rook were opposite each other, too.
[203:51.76]That's how I feel.
[203:52.28]The rook and knight are on the same wall.
[204:03.52]So, when I get all these pieces, they all have to be... Okay, I see what you're doing.
[204:08.85]I see what you're doing here.
[204:12.96]Yeah, yeah.
[204:14.00]I need to get the other one though.
[204:20.18]So I'm just going to put... How am I going to get the other one?
[204:35.10]I'm going to take this one with me.
[204:38.43]Because I can use it.
[204:40.35]Unlocking the U area door.
[204:42.13]I lost the thing that tells you how to unlock the door in that last mad dash.
[204:48.77]But if anyone remembers which plug goes where, please be a pal and share by posting info on the board.
[204:54.25]Find the plugs.
[204:59.29]So, three of them are here.
[205:01.07]I need the... I gotta go back to that.
[205:03.07]How the hell am I gonna get that?
[205:04.07]I gotta unlock a shortcut or something.
[205:12.33]Whatever.
[205:14.47]Let me go back to where the valve was.
[205:22.06]T-bar handle slot is down.
[205:23.86]There's so much going on in this game.
[205:32.86]Is there anything else I can... No.
[205:33.96]I'm just going to go.
[205:37.82]From here, I want to go... Wait.
[205:43.46]No, that's the door that's locked.
[205:45.33]Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[205:53.91]I'm gonna find my way to that T-pose.
[206:05.85]Which is down here.
[206:09.27]Someone's probably gonna get the fuck up.
[206:10.81]I hope not.
[206:15.32]Alien Slug is still going to be here, which is not good for me.
[206:18.26]But I need to get to right here.
[206:23.81]I think... Do I have any, like, flashbangs on me?
[206:30.25]I don't know if I... I can't make it across here without distracting him.
[206:42.62]That's what I wanted.
[206:43.66]That's what I wanted.
[206:44.30]This is what I wanted.
[207:02.41]Turn it!
[207:09.37]Yeah, I wanted to stuff the grenade as well.
[207:11.07]So I could get in here.
[207:13.81]I didn't get rid of it, right?
[207:14.57]I still have it?
[207:15.23]Yeah.
[207:19.09]So what is in here?
[207:21.19]Shotgun!
[207:22.19]Sick.
[207:22.47]There's a lift I can turn on.
[207:41.01]Workroom.
[207:52.59]You can't.
[207:53.20]Come on.
[207:53.56]You have... Ooh!
[207:56.58]Awesome.
[208:03.29]Roll of film.
[208:04.09]Gonna need it later.
[208:05.45]He's gonna get up.
[208:06.67]And he's not.
[208:09.47]Alright.
[208:09.83]New roll of film.
[208:13.54]I gotta eventually get back to the main building.
[208:24.60]Now what is this bleeding?
[208:30.21]Plug socket.
[208:31.47]Ooh!
[208:34.01]Wait, wait, wait, don't take it yet.
[208:43.72]I got them all.
[208:44.80]Right?
[208:47.48]This one's locked.
[208:48.20]Now I got all- now I can turn around and go back down.
[208:53.08]Because this is... Yeah, I got them all.
[209:01.34]This can't be opened.
[209:02.20]I'm going to go back up the elevator there.
[209:08.55]Out of the way.
[209:23.13]Puzzle time.
[209:24.66]Let's figure it out.
[209:35.72]Let's.
[209:36.55]Up, up, up.
[209:46.93]Fuck.
[209:52.08]We're dead?
[209:56.77]Oh shit, you got a knife.
[209:57.73]Did I stab him like an hour ago?
[210:00.61]Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[210:20.81]Take me across... into the monitor room.
[210:27.96]I would... I needed... five pieces?
[210:30.28]Or three?
[210:36.76]Let's bring it over here.
[210:42.13]One, two, three, four, five.
[210:43.31]I need six.
[210:44.55]But how many do I have now?
[210:48.45]I'm missing one more?
[210:53.66]Shit, I am missing... I'm missing two more.
[211:00.78]One, two, three, four... I need two more.
[211:03.88]The Rook and the Knight are on the same wall, and the Bishop and Queen aren't next to each other.
[211:14.91]Dammit.
[211:18.28]There's more!
[211:23.35]I can go ahead and store the film.
[211:25.94]I don't need it.
[211:28.32]I got the tool for the other twisty, and then it's probably going to be done.
[211:32.28]No, I have enough.
[211:32.86]I have enough.
[211:33.26]I have enough.
[211:33.58]What do you mean, I have enough?
[211:41.08]Enough what?
[211:41.96]What the hell am I talking about?
[211:46.29]Do I have any regular gunpowder?
[211:48.69]No.
[211:53.96]Okay.
[211:57.78]Looking good.
[211:59.84]Thankfully, I've not been hit, so I haven't had to use any of the heals.
[212:02.36]That's good.
[212:03.36]That's a good thing.
[212:07.77]So where is that other valve?
[212:14.35]I know.
[212:14.61]There it is.
[212:14.97]Right here, right?
[212:16.67]So this is back down again.
[212:21.15]into this area, and then down there.
[212:24.01]Okay, so let's just fucking go.
[212:36.09]This is boring.
[212:36.94]Give us Mr. X. Well, I mean, you kind of need... That was like a full hour straight of just intense blood-pounding pressure.
[212:50.03]You kind of need like a... You gotta come down a little.
[212:52.99]You gotta have a... Put the chest pieces in the slot minigame for like 40 minutes after that.
[213:01.18]I don't mind the slower kind of portion here.
[213:04.80]Kind of needs it.
[213:08.80]I was gonna die for an hour straight.
[213:16.63]I need to go... Where the hell do I need to go?
[213:22.13]This used to be a Mr. X stream.
[213:28.47]So, I gotta go that way.
[213:31.43]Wait, where?
[213:40.04]So this is the, yep.
[213:43.30]Stick it in.
[213:45.02]I need like a soda.
[213:46.96]I wanna get like a Coke.
[213:59.30]Oh, like a sprite.
[214:01.58]When was the last time anybody here purchased, like, a 12-pack of sprite?
[214:05.16]I don't know if it's ever happened.
[214:07.71]But I want a sprite right now.
[214:09.11]Oh, ice.
[214:13.07]Key.
[214:15.11]This is the key.
[214:15.85]Okay, there's a locked door I know that I can use this on.
[214:18.07]What about a... piece?
[214:22.32]Some kind of... piece?
[214:28.52]I guess I gotta... Let's look down here first.
[214:30.68]Right where it's kind of dying.
[214:46.59]What are those?
[214:47.01]What the hell is that thing?
[214:49.53]No, no, no.
[214:50.27]What?
[214:50.87]No, no more enemy types.
[214:58.36]There's, like, facehuggers now.
[215:13.91]Hi.
[215:14.53]Where's Ada?
[215:22.17]Oh, Ada, come on.
[215:23.03]I gotta get you out of here.
[215:23.91]Ada!
[215:24.96]Ada!
[215:26.74]No, not one of you.
[215:32.77]Oh, come on.
[215:33.53]Stab him with the knife.
[215:35.13]Knife.
[215:36.67]Oh, no.
[215:37.15]It's fine.
[215:37.77]Here.
[215:38.17]Grenade.
[215:39.01]I'm wasting the grenade.
[215:40.29]No, I'm not.
[215:40.85]I need them.
[215:41.87]These exact types of... Didn't waste a grenade.
[215:54.07]I need them.
[216:20.02]Show me the eye.
[216:30.67]What the fu- Okay, now I gotta heal.
[216:32.52]Now I gotta heal.
[216:46.62]You're gonna show your eye?
[216:47.56]Where's his eye?
[216:48.44]Alright, why are you not showing me your eye?
[216:54.31]Fucking hell.
[217:10.75]I'm just gonna fucking run by him.
[217:14.25]No.
[217:14.71]Stab him.
[217:15.27]I have a knife.
[217:16.21]In the mouth.
[217:23.48]Move!
[217:29.32]Fuck off.
[217:44.26]There's items and shit, man.
[217:45.64]I can't miss them.
[217:46.50]Yes, I can.
[217:47.04]Just... What's happening?
[217:51.61]Son of a bitch.
[218:05.50]Where?
[218:17.97]What the hell?
[218:18.81]Oh my god, get away from me!
[218:26.06]Is there anything even over here?
[218:33.10]What's that fucking noise?
[218:56.75]Nothing.
[219:01.61]Where am I in regard- Supply storage room is where I am right now.
[219:09.96]Combine them.
[219:11.18]I need it.
[219:11.48]I need more shotgun shells.
[219:24.02]Where the hell is that guy?
[219:26.44]Mr. X. He showed up to Ada.
[219:36.83]Uh... Okay, it is in like... Okay, there's another... Uh... Ooh.
[219:44.90]Did it blow up there?
[219:49.36]Oh.
[219:52.62]Shit.
[219:57.12]Okay, so I need to get them both out of here, right?
[219:59.34]There's three plug sockets in here.
[220:08.17]So I gotta do this in the right order, apparently.
[220:10.19]Which, I'm sure we'll figure that out.
[220:16.94]Grab from here.
[220:17.74]Ooh, I can get that.
[220:21.68]Hold on.
[220:26.16]Hmm.
[220:27.30]Asshole.
[220:30.38]Alright, so let's pull this out of here.
[220:36.74]This is... Then drop down.
[220:45.40]Then I can... Okay, blow his head off.
[220:52.49]He ain't getting up.
[220:53.27]Good.
[220:54.88]So now I'm gonna grab the item.
[220:59.52]Whatever this is, what is this, like a grenade launcher?
[221:07.40]Chemical flamethrower.
[221:11.36]Hold right trigger to fire the flamethrower.
[221:12.86]The longer you torch a target, the bigger the flames you'll create.
[221:22.17]Can I open this?
[221:23.25]Yeah, I can.
[221:26.50]That's now open.
[221:27.50]Give me these pieces so I can pick up this one.
[221:31.44]Three, and then... No, I gotta get back up.
[221:40.17]This one... Blue herb.
[221:51.05]Shit, I need to...
[222:02.24]Wasn't there three in here?
[222:03.48]I just kind of locked myself in here.
[222:08.77]Wasn't there one more up there?
[222:09.73]Am I still missing one no matter what?
[222:16.59]Oops, sorry.
[222:25.56]That's closed.
[222:27.86]This is closed now too.
[222:29.52]Did I just fuck myself?
[222:35.03]There's not one in there, right?
[222:45.06]I don't think there is one in there.
[222:49.38]I'm just making sure.
[222:59.07]How the fuck do I get out of this?
[223:03.80]I just, like, had it, and I'm, like, looking around for... God damn it.
[223:15.56]I, like, was on the way out, too.
[223:22.14]So, speaking of on the way out, this is the way to get out of this.
[223:26.79]So, I need...
[223:32.69]I just like screwed myself so bad.
[223:34.71]Because now I can't leave.
[223:40.55]This door is open, but this one's not.
[223:44.85]I hate shit like this.
[223:47.37]This shit drives me fucking crazy.
[223:51.33]Because I have to get out of the door over here.
[223:55.79]Oh, and I did it in reverse and now I have no fucking idea.
[224:06.12]I pretty much had it done, and now... Oh, I hate shit like this with a passion.
[224:13.50]Like, where's the actual fucking exit?
[224:36.87]Do I actually have to do this again and drop down?
[224:40.14]No.
[224:41.08]Yeah, I literally have no idea what's going on.
[224:43.52]I'm not gonna lie.
[224:44.58]Like, I have absolutely not a single clue what's going on.
[224:51.91]Because now I can go this way, but I can't leave.
[224:57.73]I have to- ow.
[225:09.25]And it's so dark, too.
[225:10.59]It's just causing my brain so many problems.
[225:15.47]Where's the plug that I just plugged it in?
[225:17.37]I wish I could turn a light on.
[225:18.31]Is there a light in this room I can turn on?
[225:19.71]Oh, the darkness is killing me.
[225:26.84]The room is spinning around in circles.
[225:30.98]Okay.
[225:45.24]I have to go through... God damn it!
[226:17.83]I have to unlock this door.
[226:23.44]Okay.
[226:25.02]So to unlock this door... I need... This one?
[226:38.40]Because then that will let me give the opportunity... To...
[226:53.98]I don't think this is... Can this even open it?
[226:56.36]Okay, so now... This door needs to be unlocked.
[226:59.94]Which... Where can I get that fucking plug from?
[227:05.84]No, no, no.
[227:14.88]So I can take this from here now, and then open the...
[227:20.40]This is the hard, this is the struggle.
[227:21.59]It's just spatial awareness in darkness.
[227:23.93]It just, it kills me.
[227:27.63]So, I have to take this one out.
[227:32.85]And put this one.
[227:37.30]But this one, that will close this door.
[227:41.48]Oh, I can't, I can't do it.
[228:09.60]I literally can't do it.
[228:11.60]My brain is too small.
[228:13.06]Just click on the fucking screen and show me where to go.
[228:17.72]My brain literally cannot do this puzzle.
[228:22.46]Okay.
[228:22.80]You guys are going to guide me.
[228:25.66]Because seriously, the darkness and the plugs and the spatial awareness is actually impossible for me to do.
[228:32.50]I am brain dead.
[228:35.25]So here's what we're going to do.
[228:39.49]Am I going- direct me.
[228:40.99]Straight?
[228:47.20]Straight.
[228:50.88]Left.
[228:52.40]Okay, left.
[228:55.50]Okay.
[228:56.88]Take king.
[229:03.83]Grab.
[229:07.63]No.
[229:11.96]Take other piece.
[229:14.28]Okay.
[229:18.00]Take king.
[229:25.00]Taking.
[229:30.52]Put king in this slot.
[229:42.88]fucking with me now yes please yes yes no does anybody else know what's going on now take this one
[230:11.49]Yes, this is the one I'm taking.
[230:17.63]Now, straight through this door.
[230:26.27]Take this one.
[230:30.09]Take Queen.
[230:42.88]Yes!
[230:44.58]Okay.
[230:45.78]I got both Queen and King.
[230:49.31]Now... Put... Put Queen in here.
[231:03.78]Okay.
[231:05.78]Now put King in here.
[231:14.98]Yep.
[231:17.85]Okay.
[231:18.89]Now... Take... Take... Now, um... Now take queen.
[231:40.54]Take queen.
[231:46.91]Queen, take.
[231:48.94]Go through, take king.
[231:52.16]And then leave room.
[232:36.61]I got them all.
[232:39.08]That was not a funny joke.
[232:41.66]I thought it was a pretty funny, absolutely not a joke.
[232:43.94]I'm really that stupid.
[232:45.00]I can't do it.
[232:45.66]I can't do puzzles like that.
[232:46.82]They're impossible for my brain.
[232:48.88]See how fast it did like that?
[232:51.54]Did that in like eight seconds.
[232:53.28]No, gates closing, dark.
[232:55.12]I can't.
[232:55.48]No, no way.
[232:56.00]I was pretending.
[232:56.62]It was a joke.
[233:01.33]So, now I gotta get the hell out of here.
[233:03.79]And I have to go... God, I gotta go back through the... I thought that just said... Bottom Weasley.
[233:10.69]I was like, why does it say Weasley?
[233:34.16]I just don't want to get hit by this stupid thing.
[233:35.76]All the blobs are dead besides this one, right?
[233:38.46]Not this one, the one in the middle.
[233:40.46]Wait, where the fuck did it go?
[233:41.70]There was one that was just right here.
[233:54.29]Did I make it out of there?
[233:55.11]Are you serious?
[233:57.47]Nothing else, right?
[233:59.27]Just get the hell out of this.
[234:04.42]Wait, did I dro- I dropped down.
[234:06.10]Can I climb over this?
[234:08.94]Fuck.
[234:18.32]How the fuck did I make it over here?
[234:19.74]Alright, alright.
[234:20.28]No, no, no, no.
[234:31.85]That's where it was.
[234:32.61]Okay.
[234:32.71]Get me the fuck out of this.
[234:38.86]Get me the fuck out of, like, another Dark Souls swamp.
[235:07.71]Screw you.
[235:08.31]God.
[235:10.75]Let's go do another puzzle.
[235:12.39]Because I got all the pieces.
[235:18.86]What difficulty is he playing on?
[235:20.86]Uh, normal.
[235:21.52]This is just normal.
[235:24.78]I gotta go back up, right?
[235:37.51]Normal with a laugh.
[235:40.35]Don't laugh at me.
[235:41.25]You played it on normal too, didn't you?
[235:46.23]On your first playthrough ever?
[235:57.40]Finally.
[236:03.68]How are we doing on box space?
[236:05.15]I got this chemical flamethrower.
[236:09.88]No regular.
[236:10.94]Uh, I guess I could make a super heal.
[236:17.68]Not really necessary at the moment.
[236:18.88]So I'm going to store this because I don't think I need it right now.
[236:25.65]So now I have one, two, so let's just, let's take a look.
[236:29.41]Let's take them all out.
[236:40.78]What does it say?
[236:42.34]Pretty sure the rook and knight are on the same wall.
[236:46.85]Okay, so there's the pawn.
[236:48.29]I know where the pawn goes.
[236:52.83]Pawn goes in here.
[236:53.51]And the knight goes in here.
[237:01.95]So it says the... Pretty sure the rook and knight are on the same wall.
[237:06.69]The bishop and the queen aren't next to each other.
[237:09.19]The queen and rook were opposite each other.
[237:11.69]So let's do it.
[237:12.39]Pretty sure the rook and knight are on the same wall.
[237:14.03]Let's put the rook on here just to have it on there.
[237:20.50]This is a rook.
[237:21.86]Just put it in.
[237:22.44]That- That leaves one space here.
[237:28.57]Bishop and queen are not next to each other.
[237:29.77]The queen and rook are opposite each other.
[237:31.65]So queen and rook opposite.
[237:33.05]So the queen has to go on this side.
[237:39.03]That's the queen, right?
[237:40.45]Yeah, queen.
[237:45.54]The bishop and the queen are not next to each other.
[237:47.42]Okay.
[237:50.82]So that means this is not the bishop.
[237:53.26]This is the king.
[237:54.48]So the king is over here andberger and the bishop is over here.
[238:01.48]And then maybe... yeah, that's it.
[238:06.02]But let me walk around in a fucking circle doing the open the gate puzzle for like 18 minutes.
[238:11.06]Alright, let me save it.
[238:25.66]How am I doing on everything?
[238:36.08]So, shotgun, no, not a whole lot of bullets.
[238:38.40]I'm gonna keep the chemical flamethrower.
[238:41.11]I'm gonna store the key for now.
[238:42.73]No, wait, isn't there a... There's a lock somewhere over here.
[238:49.75]It's right here.
[238:54.77]Is that key for... Key to a section of the sewers.
[239:06.90]Sewer no entry zone.
[239:15.21]I don't know if that's a waste of my time to go all the way back here.
[239:21.61]Water injection chamber or workers break room.
[239:24.21]Because right now I'm down here and that means I have to go up.
[239:33.80]Um, I don't know if that's worth going to get.
[239:35.74]If there's like five shotgun shells there, I'm going to be pretty pissed off.
[239:43.81]Because that means I have to go out all the way through here again.
[239:46.87]And then up there.
[239:49.89]Oh, not up there.
[239:50.73]Up here.
[239:51.11]Plug socket, I guess...
[240:08.37]I don't care.
[240:12.11]Nah, I don't think I care.
[240:13.10]To be honest.
[240:17.98]No, I want that.
[240:21.96]Alright, heal... I'm not that great on the ammo department at the moment.
[240:31.06]I got two good full heals.
[240:36.98]It is important, it is, it is, it is.
[240:38.56]Alright, well fine, I'll do it.
[240:40.66]Let's just go open it.
[240:42.96]There's five shotgun shells in here, you're all in big trouble.
[240:45.90]So that means I have to go out here and then down... Or maybe can I go up from here?
[241:03.43]You need a plug.
[241:07.54]Does it matter which plug or is it just a plug?
[241:16.46]Do I need two?
[241:20.71]This door stays open.
[241:24.21]I need the rook.
[241:27.43]Where the hell is the rook?
[241:29.23]Uh, that's not the rook.
[241:31.17]Uh, that's the pawn.
[241:33.88]That's a king.
[241:35.66]That's a rook.
[241:42.05]Okay.
[241:44.15]So I have the rook.
[241:46.89]I'm gonna go open the door.
[241:49.55]Now the question is, what's the fastest way to get to that door?
[241:54.40]Here's the upper waterway.
[241:55.86]I have to get here.
[242:00.14]So I have to cross this, right?
[242:06.80]Let's see if I can get there from here.
[242:09.74]Maybe I should go up.
[242:15.55]Maybe up from here?
[242:16.93]And then I have to walk all the way around?
[242:18.27]Oh, that sucks!
[242:22.38]That's so far!
[242:28.78]Hold on, let me see.
[242:58.02]See if I can reliably get there fast from this way.
[243:00.59]If I go left, can I go from there, I wonder?
[243:04.71]Let's see.
[243:10.81]I don't want to use a bunch of bullets.
[243:13.03]I don't want to waste a bunch of bullets.
[243:16.11]Can I get there from here?
[243:19.83]No, I can't get there from here.
[243:21.05]Shit.
[243:42.53]So, confirm this with my brain here because I want to make sure I'm not going to do something stupid.
[243:48.17]If I go down here and then to the lift, that takes me up to here and then from here to here, right?
[243:59.96]Okay, I just want to make sure that that's what's happening.
[244:11.99]It is called the Worker's Rift.
[244:24.13]Don't get up.
[244:31.17]Alright.
[244:32.09]Open that door.
[244:33.06]I hope this is worth it.
[244:37.88]Or you're gonna see me go like this.
[244:43.13]I'm gonna make a fist and I'm gonna squeeze it.
[244:48.20]So then that opens the door up here.
[244:49.66]Alright, I hope it's worth it!
[244:59.98]Shit!
[245:00.86]Where the hell did you come from?
[245:05.54]Dick.
[245:05.74]Alright, let me in.
[245:13.60]Alright, we got gunpowder.
[245:15.48]Not impressed so far.
[245:18.32]Empty.
[245:22.16]Nine handgun bullets.
[245:26.00]A jazz festival flyer.
[245:34.74]SZF.
[245:37.14]That's the password to somebody's locker.
[245:48.26]Okay, interesting.
[245:56.09]So what's this?
[246:09.73]Where the hell is... where am I going?
[246:20.09]Special weapons case.
[246:35.80]Underground stairs.
[246:37.62]What the fuck?
[246:46.15]No, I can't open that.
[246:47.35]This is the bottom.
[246:49.05]Oh, alright.
[246:50.38]This leads all the way back up to the police station?
[246:53.14]Yeah.
[246:55.02]Weird, so now the whole thing is connected.
[247:00.08]I guess that... Wait, this is... The badge will fit in there?
[247:17.59]I gotta get that badge then!
[247:26.92]Alright, so now I'm gonna go into here.
[247:28.56]Oh, still gotta go upstairs.
[247:36.04]What is that an upgrade for?
[247:48.10]Don't forget the film.
[247:53.40]I mean, there's a... I'm... Okay, so hold on.
[247:55.88]I'm good.
[247:56.52]Alright.
[248:02.84]Film.
[248:06.05]USB dongle.
[248:11.69]Oh, shit.
[248:14.77]What is that for?
[248:21.89]Wait, hold on.
[248:30.02]Nice, okay.
[248:32.66]This thing's probably already... This goes back out to the main hall.
[248:40.47]It still can be used somewhere.
[248:46.19]Is there a save point in here?
[248:54.70]Excellent.
[248:55.50]So then now... Here's the main hall.
[249:02.20]That's pretty cool.
[249:04.34]Alright.
[249:06.40]Ada is probably dead.
[249:08.96]Well, we didn't need her anyways.
[249:10.84]We're on our own mission.
[249:12.72]Let me go open this shit up.
[249:16.51]Actually, wait.
[249:16.89]What about the film?
[249:17.47]Might as well go develop it.
[249:26.70]Okay, that's saved.
[249:27.66]Alright.
[249:28.54]Darkroom!
[249:30.38]So we need to go through here, and then bang a right.
[249:43.77]Which will bring us to right there, and then bang a right.
[249:48.19]Oh, shit!
[249:48.63]The lickers!
[249:49.01]I forgot!
[249:50.43]For good.
[249:57.07]No, no, no, don't die here.
[249:58.23]Don't you die here.
[249:59.17]Don't you die in here.
[249:59.95]Okay.
[250:09.65]Film.
[250:15.21]Hiding place.
[250:23.80]Couple of desks?
[250:25.10]Where are those desks?
[250:31.43]Like the... I have no idea.
[250:46.98]The offices, yeah, but I mean, which one?
[250:50.60]Up here.
[250:53.96]Hidden.
[250:54.74]Well, what's even hidden up there?
[250:57.95]Cause he's talking about that.
[250:58.75]That's quite, that's a journey for me to go on right now.
[251:00.95]Hold on.
[251:02.57]If I go up from here, I'm gonna get myself fucking killed.
[251:22.01]So I'm just gonna try, I'm gonna go up the stairs from here and we'll go to the star's office.
[251:37.04]Star's office.
[251:39.76]Straight through.
[251:40.42]Bang left.
[251:41.90]Wait, lickers?
[251:54.06]How did I miss this?
[252:00.56]Hold on a second.
[252:01.64]No, I can't go this way.
[252:02.34]I gotta go through the showers.
[252:03.22]There are lickers all over the place here.
[252:12.24]I've got to walk through here and then through the door.
[252:30.30]I know there's at least one up here.
[252:31.86]I have shot this thing ten times.
[252:40.86]Straight and it's on the left.
[252:48.10]There he is.
[253:06.62]All right, so where was that?
[253:09.38]It was somebody's desk with coffee on it?
[253:12.24]Let me take a look.
[253:16.14]There's a stereo player and then a phone with some pens.
[253:21.52]Looking for the phone with some pens on it.
[253:28.70]Not there.
[253:37.05]Okay, right here.
[253:41.85]Wooden box.
[253:44.33]A slightly heavy wooden box.
[253:47.90]Alright.
[253:49.72]That's all I got.
[253:50.44]A piece of wood.
[253:52.36]Come on, I can open this.
[253:56.00]Red dot sight for the lightning hawk.
[253:58.06]A custom part for the lightning hawk that allows for lightning fast aiming.
[254:03.09]Alright.
[254:03.81]Pretty cool.
[254:06.69]Uh... So then from... That's sick, but... The other one is with the boom box.
[254:21.91]I gotta get back out to the main hall.
[254:26.09]And then the first floor, it was like down here, right?
[254:30.55]East office or press room?
[254:40.43]What did I do?
[254:40.87]I just got more film?
[254:41.79]Oh, what kind of wild goose chase is this putting me on?
[254:45.81]This is like a treasure hunt.
[254:51.89]I get the USB to go in the computer.
[254:53.85]I've got to go check the press room.
[254:55.49]I got to watch out for the liquor.
[254:57.47]All right.
[255:04.67]So I got to back through.
[255:09.19]Back into the dark room.
[255:16.94]Or maybe not.
[255:18.08]Yeah.
[255:19.84]So I gotta go back to get to the main hall again.
[255:23.36]Let's go to main.
[255:25.02]Keep searching the desk.
[255:28.38]What, there's like hidden prompts everywhere or something?
[255:30.36]I don't get it.
[255:32.04]Search desk.
[255:32.60]Search the desk again.
[255:33.38]There's nothing here.
[255:36.64]Missed desk.
[255:37.32]What?
[255:40.54]Oh, you're just jebaiting me.
[255:41.50]All right.
[255:46.91]I'm gonna do the same thing that's gonna go down from here.
[255:48.87]And we're gonna develop this film.
[255:51.67]So we just have to slowly make our way away from the liquor.
[256:01.60]Through the shower.
[256:02.82]What do you mean wrong way?
[256:08.54]I'm just going back down to the... USB, USB, USB.
[256:12.92]I already got the lightning.
[256:16.91]Forgot that.
[256:17.27]What do you mean?
[256:17.85]What are you talking about?
[256:18.55]You talking about going down?
[256:19.41]What are you guys talking about?
[256:20.57]I already did it.
[256:24.69]Yeah, I know.
[256:25.15]I have it.
[256:25.75]And then I'm gonna put that in the secret room downstairs.
[256:29.40]No, I know.
[256:29.72]I know what's going on.
[256:35.80]I got it.
[256:39.40]So then, let's just go.
[256:41.48]Just start running.
[256:42.38]Fuck it.
[256:43.82]Running out of time here.
[256:44.70]Down the stairs.
[256:50.81]That'll bring me to first floor.
[256:52.40]Dark room.
[256:53.16]Develop this film.
[256:54.52]How did that not hit?
[257:00.98]Didn't even need to do it either.
[257:04.77]Alright, more film to develop.
[257:07.13]I'm gonna get more, like, treasure pictures.
[257:08.61]Uh...
[257:20.36]Okay, that, it's just a, that's it.
[257:28.83]Check desk.
[257:30.77]So that's good, I got that, now I gotta go out here.
[257:35.54]I'm gonna go through the west office, back into the main hall, I'm gonna go to the press room.
[257:44.40]Yeah, yeah, I think that's, I think so, yeah.
[257:48.55]So left, left, straight.
[257:56.15]Wee!
[258:34.77]Alright.
[258:37.71]Check the press room... under the boom box.
[258:47.06]And then from there... I can just go... right through there... and we'll see if I can find where the hell this thing is.
[258:56.78]These stupid enemies are just gonna be right here, aren't they?
[259:04.86]Are they lickers here?
[259:05.63]I just don't know what I've killed.
[259:11.07]Everything comes back to life in this game.
[259:12.67]Okay.
[259:28.38]Boombox.
[259:31.42]Boombox, boombox, boombox.
[259:43.31]Where is it?
[259:45.33]Boombox?
[259:49.65]Boombox, got it.
[259:52.03]Ooh, fuel times 400.
[259:58.29]That's pretty great, actually.
[259:59.59]Anything else in here?
[260:06.62]That's it, right?
[260:07.89]I got... That's a lot of ammo.
[260:14.09]That should take us... Now, go back up to the main hall.
[260:16.88]Down.
[260:17.42]Put the USB in.
[260:18.34]There's nothing else here.
[260:23.62]There's no other... I can't, like... I can't do it.
[260:26.63]Nothing there.
[260:28.79]All right.
[260:32.34]Ada Wong is fucking dead.
[260:35.45]She'll be fine.
[260:37.01]I'm just gonna go bang, bang, bang, out back to the main hall, down the stairs, dongle.
[260:42.75]Alright, let's go get this secret item.
[260:57.01]There's so much to do.
[260:59.09]I'm surprised they were able to fit this much.
[261:01.91]Even little secrets.
[261:04.78]It's really, really cool.
[261:05.98]So I have it in my inventory, right?
[261:09.80]I do.
[261:12.76]I'm gonna come... Actually, I'll do it right now.
[261:17.10]Put the lightning hawk in here.
[261:21.53]So this is a laser scope with the lightning hawk.
[261:25.17]Nice.
[261:27.17]Okay.
[261:29.75]Okay.
[261:32.83]Let's go get another piece of whatever it is.
[261:39.47]Stop.
[261:39.83]Stop.
[261:40.17]Stop.
[261:40.77]What?
[261:40.99]Stop what?
[261:41.31]What?
[261:41.61]What happened?
[261:44.71]What's wrong?
[261:46.91]What happened?
[261:52.43]Show us the gun.
[261:53.21]I will once I put the dongle in here.
[261:56.77]Because they're not going to save.
[262:01.39]And then we'll continue.
[262:04.88]OK.
[262:07.88]Nice.
[262:09.06]What is it?
[262:12.07]What?
[262:25.99]Okay, I was gonna say, did I get baited here?
[262:28.19]Okay, it's a pedal and brake.
[262:33.41]Long barrel.
[262:36.87]And... Is that it?
[262:38.95]Those two clips?
[262:43.13]No.
[262:43.59]Alright, so I- this is great.
[262:45.98]Custom part for the Lightning Hog.
[262:47.06]This ball barrel reduces recoil and imparts extra speed to bullets, increasing damage.
[262:53.97]So this thing is decked out now.
[262:56.37]It's two slots.
[262:58.05]Let's see it.
[263:01.53]This is the kind of gun that you have to actually be very careful.
[263:07.38]I only have... ...11 bullets?
[263:14.04]That's a last boss weapon, if it is.
[263:16.90]You know, if I've ever seen one.
[263:18.86]This thing is now done.
[263:19.92]Goodbye.
[263:23.63]Alright.
[263:24.35]Let me go save it.
[263:26.01]Combine this shit.
[263:27.03]Get things in a box.
[263:29.23]Uh, where... No.
[263:30.08]I'm... I'm... Is there anything else?
[263:36.44]I just know where this is, so... I wonder.
[263:44.06]German, no.
[263:44.56]What?
[263:44.74]What's the matter?
[263:51.56]You look extra cute tonight.
[263:52.96]Hey, thanks.
[263:55.05]Thank you.
[263:55.71]That's very nice of you.
[263:56.71]Come on.
[264:05.01]Yeah, the flyer too, right?
[264:06.29]It was like Z, Z, S, F or something.
[264:13.02]All right.
[264:13.88]It's time to make something happen here.
[264:15.62]I'm going to load this gun.
[264:18.70]Because I want it to be... Okay, seven out of four.
[264:25.48]Store it.
[264:26.28]Store it.
[264:27.79]Store it.
[264:28.59]Store it.
[264:30.97]Maybe I should store the shotgun for now.
[264:40.61]Look at all these blue herbs.
[265:03.06]I gotta bring these back anyways.
[265:04.54]Um... What do I do with these herbs?
[265:10.63]This is anti-poison.
[265:12.19]I could combine three of them again, but I'm not sure it's even worth doing that.
[265:19.39]It can't be used as it has to be combined.
[265:20.95]Can you do red and blue?
[265:21.92]Red and blue does, like, constitution, right?
[265:27.22]What does red and blue actually do for you?
[265:48.33]So I've got two complete super heals.
[265:52.21]Red and blue.
[265:53.29]I'm gonna do red and blue.
[265:55.67]I'm just, I wanna know what it does.
[266:02.90]Okay, so this is like a guard.
[266:05.52]So it's a defense boost.
[266:06.76]So I'm just gonna do it again.
[266:14.85]No, no, no, I'm gonna wait for a green.
[266:17.42]I'll wait for a green to do this.
[266:26.15]Okay.
[266:28.95]I am slightly ready to go.
[266:31.97]Let me save, and we'll go back to what we were doing, which I honestly, it was so long ago, I don't even remember what the hell we were doing.
[266:41.33]You can always add the green after.
[266:43.05]Idiot!
[266:44.41]But I like the way it looks in my inventory.
[266:47.99]I like the way it looks in my inventory.
[266:56.57]There's also that other door that I need to open.
[266:58.46]It's on the other side of the... where I put the plug in.
[267:08.71]So let's go all the way down.
[267:13.11]Alright, so.
[267:16.07]Was it this way?
[267:17.69]Yes it was.
[267:18.57]Was it?
[267:18.83]No it wasn't.
[267:34.70]It's an interesting shortcut though.
[267:39.47]Ada is fucking dead.
[267:41.39]No, she's not.
[267:42.13]She's gonna be just fine.
[267:44.67]She texted me.
[267:46.89]She said, LOL, spike sticking out of leg.
[267:51.71]Help?
[267:53.35]I said, be there soon.
[267:55.83]She said, how soon?
[267:58.35]With like a kind of a slant like, mmm.
[268:01.01]Said, 30 minutes.
[268:03.71]Texted back, can you stop at McDonald's?
[268:06.51]I'm like,
[268:08.82]Fucking hell.
[268:10.36]Yeah, what do you want?
[268:11.90]Oh, you're gonna stop.
[268:12.50]Cool.
[268:12.80]I'll take a number one and a large coke and two large fries.
[268:17.30]Alright, man.
[268:18.80]Whatever.
[268:20.72]So, where's the heal?
[268:21.84]Not heal.
[268:24.32]Alright, I gotta go out here.
[268:28.51]This way.
[268:29.87]I gotta put the plug in.
[268:30.95]I'm gonna shoot this guy in the head.
[268:38.42]So it's the rook, right?
[268:51.36]What's in this room?
[268:52.87]Hopefully something worth spending about the last 35 minutes doing.
[269:01.39]And it looks to be... bullets, super bullets, gunpowder, gunpowder.
[269:09.58]And that's the only thing in this room.
[269:14.60]So, not terrible.
[269:17.12]I could make some more bullets with the, uh... Missed something.
[269:23.44]What'd I miss?
[269:26.36]In this room?
[269:26.88]I don't see anything.
[269:31.72]Too bad there's not a first aid spray.
[269:33.60]I like those.
[269:37.92]Back up.
[269:46.09]Back through.
[269:48.15]Let's go.
[269:50.97]Take me back to where I was so I can go save Ada.
[270:03.82]Do not attack me.
[270:04.96]The slug monster is going to be right here.
[270:07.17]Is it alive?
[270:08.01]I keep thinking these things are alive.
[270:16.16]That one is, but I don't need to even go near it.
[270:18.07]You get out of the way.
[270:32.63]Time for progress.
[270:33.89]Save the game.
[270:34.55]Through the door.
[270:35.33]I'm ready.
[270:44.64]That guy wasn't a zombie.
[270:47.38]Imagine that poor guy.
[270:57.01]Excellent.
[270:57.31]Let's just triple check.
[270:59.53]Okay, so should I make more magnum ammo?
[271:10.10]Because, what is high grade and large gunpowder?
[271:14.72]No, that's... How do I make the mag, the ammo?
[271:20.33]You can't.
[271:20.77]So this is just going to be a bunch of shotgun shells then.
[271:24.35]Which is actually probably better.
[271:30.14]Two yellows, or should I just make six?
[271:33.38]Or what, six shotgun shells?
[271:37.61]I feel like I need some shotgun ammo, and this is done, so.
[271:43.17]It'll be three shotgun shells.
[271:48.59]Wouldn't it be six?
[271:56.19]So just wait for another one to make another yellow.
[271:57.85]Okay.
[271:58.91]These, uh, need to get rid of these.
[272:05.81]I am kind of running low on ammo, though.
[272:10.94]So the... Do I need to bring one of these with me?
[272:12.90]Does it even matter?
[272:13.98]I'm done with this.
[272:16.74]This is just done.
[272:18.26]I'm not going to regret not taking one of these.
[272:21.74]Whatever.
[272:25.27]All right.
[272:26.81]Destroy that key is done.
[272:28.53]Let me take a couple.
[272:29.73]I feel like there's something coming up here.
[272:33.29]You know, something's coming up.
[272:38.61]I might as well just forward everything.
[272:50.89]I'll take it, I'll take it.
[272:54.15]I'm not gonna take the fuel though, I'll take it.
[272:59.11]Mr. X would like to know your location.
[273:12.52]What about grenades?
[273:18.08]Mr. X would like to know, I don't have any.
[273:30.98]Another blue herb.
[273:31.92]I should just go deposit it.
[273:33.66]Yeah, just go deposit it into your bank.
[273:37.00]You're gonna need it.
[273:48.36]Good.
[273:54.13]So, uh, left is the flamethrower.
[273:58.21]So is this the anti-Mr. X gun?
[274:00.60]Is that what people are saying here?
[274:03.27]Oh, goddammit.
[274:37.94]Mr. X is in chat.
[274:40.20]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[274:41.20]I need to save it again.
[274:43.56]Oh, god damn it.
[274:44.10]I found more healing items.
[274:47.04]Fucking stupid game.
[274:56.33]Forward.
[275:01.57]Alright, Edo.
[275:02.17]I'm here.
[275:02.99]Do you have any blood left?
[275:07.10]Are you out of blood?
[275:10.02]Main power room.
[275:11.02]Wait, what about the, what about the garage room?
[275:18.03]Okay.
[275:19.63]Alright, Ada.
[275:29.05]God damn it, more healing items.
[275:31.78]Shit!
[275:34.30]Uh, let me check to make sure I don't miss anything.
[275:39.89]Doesn't look like I'm missing anything.
[275:43.71]It's gonna be one of those switch flipping mini games.
[275:47.93]I'm pretty good at these.
[276:04.08]Power's back on.
[276:06.46]If I'm able to make it back, I'm gonna save.
[276:09.78]Ho ho ho!
[276:10.98]Jesus Christ!
[276:12.34]Oh, my bomb hit me!
[276:13.54]Mario!
[276:19.96]What the fuck am I supposed to do?
[276:21.34]Um... Power!
[276:31.48]What do I do?
[276:32.04]Shoot?
[276:35.68]I have to make his hand hit something.
[276:37.56]My chest hurts.
[276:38.36]Ow.
[277:00.82]Where the fuck is he?
[277:02.44]Hey!
[277:31.16]Where is the wall?
[277:32.73]I'm against a wall!
[278:02.96]Ooh, I thought he was gonna go down!
[278:04.15]Get out of the fire!
[278:06.07]I thought he was gonna go down.
[278:06.91]How am I doing on health?
[278:10.93]I'm okay.
[278:18.72]Holy shit, goodbye.
[278:49.62]Uh, turn it on.
[278:54.64]Hit him!
[278:55.10]Knock him off the table!
[278:56.46]What the fuck?
[278:57.32]It didn't go the correct way!
[279:10.82]What did I just take?
[279:26.32]Take them!
[279:27.20]Take them!
[279:34.35]Come on, hit him!
[279:52.34]So I'm not even gonna use... Okay, that's good.
[279:53.98]It's a good thing that that happened.
[279:55.46]Because I'm not gonna use any bullets.
[279:56.88]I'm just gonna... I'm gonna just smash him.
[280:04.80]I'm gonna save.
[280:08.71]Oh, I can't save any bullets.
[280:15.59]Video game.
[280:16.71]What are you even made out of?
[280:23.08]Alright.
[280:29.09]Alright, hit him.
[280:38.59]Do it!
[280:39.71]Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it!
[280:42.82]Where is it?
[280:43.92]Hit him!
[280:53.26]Fuck.
[281:37.98]You know what I mean?
[281:54.26]Yikes!
[281:56.83]Jesus Christ!
[282:16.39]Crap.
[282:18.15]Oh, I missed.
[282:21.25]Crap.
[282:24.85]Ah, crap.
[282:35.91]Do I have to shoot his eye?
[282:41.01]No.
[282:41.21]Okay, watch out, creep.
[282:43.97]Get out of the fucking fire!
[282:46.89]Oh, creep!
[282:47.65]I get to keep all my ammo, guys.
[283:08.35]I heard somebody call me a scumbag.
[283:46.64]Goodbye!
[283:48.52]Farewell!
[283:50.48]It's been nice knowing you, but you're dead.
[284:03.21]You're not dead.
[284:11.85]Why are you still alive here?
[284:20.89]Back of the eye, back of the eye.
[284:22.63]What did I hit?
[284:23.07]I don't understand.
[284:25.31]What's going on?
[284:26.17]Why is he still alive?
[284:26.89]Do I have to do it again?
[284:28.13]I actually have to do it again.
[285:01.66]Go down.
[285:03.67]He's not down.
[285:04.61]Fuck.
[285:12.63]No, don't fall over here.
[285:13.93]Can I push him?
[285:20.45]Bye-bye!
[285:45.15]I used a lot of ammo there.
[285:50.96]Maybe I should redo it.
[285:58.98]Let's hope that's the last of them.
[286:07.12]No, I'm good.
[286:07.62]I'm good.
[286:07.94]I'm good.
[286:08.24]I just had... It's fine.
[286:10.27]I got plenty of other ammo.
[286:14.52]Plus, speaking of ammo, there's some right here.
[286:15.92]Where the hell is it?
[286:23.39]Where's this magical handgun ammo?
[286:24.73]Oh.
[286:24.81]Okay, let me take a look.
[286:30.30]Out of shotgun shells, I got some magnum ammo.
[286:37.14]My health is fine.
[286:39.84]I made a little bridge for myself.
[286:42.57]And alright.
[286:48.14]Ada, you still alive?
[286:49.08]Did I grab the knife?
[286:58.67]The knife.
[287:03.05]What?
[287:03.33]There was no knife.
[287:04.40]But there's a save.
[287:16.40]Now, I'm in a little bit of trouble, because no shotgun ammo.
[287:27.61]I have plenty of heals.
[287:31.59]I'm gonna have to conserve ammo here.
[287:41.02]Uh, somebody just gave 50- Stormy2 just gave 50 dollars.
[287:45.68]Stormychoo, thank you so much for 50 bucks.
[287:47.74]5,000 bits.
[287:49.38]From Stormychoo.
[287:51.38]Stream's been great so far.
[287:52.54]Lots of laughs tonight.
[287:53.36]Question for you.
[287:54.57]What would you do in a Resident Evil scenario?
[287:58.65]You gotta try.
[288:00.25]You know, I wouldn't use a gun.
[288:02.67]Because guns are unreliable.
[288:04.31]You need to have ammunition for a gun.
[288:06.95]So instead of having, like, ammo for a gun, I would just get a metal baseball bat.
[288:14.80]I wouldn't be dead.
[288:15.28]We talk about a metal baseball bat and you just swing as hard as you can for their heads.
[288:23.48]It never runs out of ammo.
[288:24.70]It will never break.
[288:26.64]And zombies are slow and stupid.
[288:28.88]You just have to hit them as hard as you can possibly swing.
[288:32.73]Double crow hop into the face.
[288:34.05]They're not going to get up.
[288:38.23]It's just not going to happen.
[288:40.47]Not a knife.
[288:41.13]No, no, no.
[288:41.59]That's too small.
[288:44.92]Or, probably even a better weapon of choice would be an oar.
[288:49.74]Like a rowboat oar.
[288:51.90]It's made out of solid wood, it's got length, and you can just oar somebody in the back of the fucking head.
[288:58.72]That's probably the best melee weapon you could probably have in a zombie apocalypse.
[289:07.00]What about a spear?
[289:07.74]No, not a spear.
[289:08.36]It's a point.
[289:11.22]A rowing oar is a big flat spatula, like this big.
[289:16.52]You don't have to aim very much.
[289:17.66]You could really just double crow hop, huge reach, and crush skulls.
[289:23.54]I would last.
[289:24.16]And then I would go to a grocery store.
[289:25.72]I would just sit at the grocery store and I would just take all the Campbell's tomato soup and that's what I would eat every day.
[289:31.06]I would live forever.
[289:39.55]Let's go.
[289:50.89]What about a 2x4?
[289:51.89]Ah, a 2x4, that's not big enough.
[289:56.13]And it's not that strong either.
[289:57.71]How would I reach it on the shelves?
[290:05.33]I have an oar.
[290:05.87]Nice try, though.
[290:06.63]I don't know if I should...
[290:19.97]Just do it.
[290:20.55]I can't walk like this.
[290:21.61]Okay.
[290:25.37]It's gonna hurt.
[290:28.58]Hold on.
[290:31.20]That's definitely infected.
[290:32.02]It's been in there for like an hour and a half.
[290:35.36]I can do it myself.
[290:36.40]Just relax, okay?
[290:40.99]What is that magical oil he's putting on?
[290:44.07]So, what do we do now?
[290:48.68]Get yourself out of here while you still can.
[290:53.04]I'm not just gonna leave you.
[290:54.17]Not like this.
[290:57.13]You don't understand.
[290:57.91]The situation's worse than I thought.
[291:03.29]You're not getting rid of me that easy.
[291:04.59]You protected me.
[291:07.01]It was antiseptic.
[291:08.23]Now it's my turn.
[291:11.03]Just get yourself into work.
[291:17.85]Grab my shoulder.
[291:18.91]Don't push it, rookie.
[291:20.15]Okay, I'm just trying to help.
[291:23.96]Watch your step.
[291:26.66]But long story short, anything that requires resources is bad in a zombie apocalypse.
[291:35.16]Net let it slip.
[291:36.52]That's where the virus samples are.
[291:39.78]You up for this?
[291:40.38]I think I could fit it in my schedule.
[291:45.25]Come on.
[291:46.69]We got work to do.
[291:48.65]But food is necessary to survive.
[291:52.07]A shotgun shell is not necessary to survive.
[291:54.63]You don't, like, eat shotgun shells.
[292:01.70]And, by the way, Campbell's tomato soup is a great weapon.
[292:06.60]You have a backpack with, like, 40 of them.
[292:09.54]And you can just take them out and club people with them.
[292:12.73]You can throw them.
[292:17.93]They're heavy as shit.
[292:19.57]They weigh like six and a half pounds.
[292:21.85]One can of Campbell's tomato soup has got six and a half pounds of tomato in there.
[292:25.65]There's six and a half tomatoes inside of one can.
[292:33.69]I need to save the game.
[292:35.37]I don't wanna see that cutscene again.
[292:40.23]Let me carry you.
[292:41.33]No, that'd only make me feel worse.
[292:46.25]I feel pretty bad, too.
[292:47.95]Come on, Ada, we're both in dire straits right now.
[292:50.29]It's not just you.
[292:51.09]Getting blinky here.
[293:15.03]Oh, right, her little keycard wrist watch will open this door, right?
[293:37.28]Item?
[293:39.30]You would think there would be something up there.
[293:41.60]This may be a one-way ride, so be prepared, Leon.
[293:45.53]Are you prepared, huh?
[293:48.21]I just saved it, so.
[293:49.05]How are we doing on time?
[293:59.55]This tram is bound for Ness.
[294:01.95]Getting kind of late, but we're good.
[294:02.97]Do not exit until the final destination.
[294:12.25]You know what I was thinking?
[294:13.77]I can't wait for the FBI to raid Umbrella headquarters and take those bastards to justice.
[294:18.25]I agree, but to be clear, you're not working in official capacity.
[294:22.90]This is a federal case.
[294:24.76]Once we get the G-virus, I'm back on my own.
[294:28.66]Hey, Leon.
[294:31.20]Trust me?
[294:31.62]Okay.
[294:33.70]You trust me?
[294:38.45]Honestly, if I didn't, you'd probably be dead.
[294:41.83]Right.
[294:43.25]I thought I might need your help, and I was right.
[294:46.45]If you can secure the G-Virus, I can make sure what happened in Raccoon City never happens again.
[294:51.15]Can I make myself look fucking huge in the webcam?
[294:54.37]It's a federal case.
[294:55.15]I don't have the authority.
[294:56.09]Leon, look at me.
[294:58.99]I'm a liability now.
[295:00.95]If I'm gonna finish this case, you're the last hope I've got.
[295:03.15]I'm not just gonna leave you here.
[295:05.97]What if you're attacked?
[295:06.85]What if you need help?
[295:09.12]What happened?
[295:10.06]Did that just happen?
[295:15.05]I'll be fine.
[295:17.47]Don't worry about me.
[295:20.13]I got to see this through.
[295:22.56]And I want to see you again.
[295:25.76]I got plenty to live for.
[295:27.00]Trust me.
[295:29.26]Now arriving at nest.
[295:31.54]Go.
[295:37.82]Please, we don't have much time.
[295:40.18]You're gonna need this.
[295:45.46]Okay.
[295:49.94]Leon.
[295:50.24]I'm counting on you.
[295:54.69]I know.
[295:57.57]I can't do that for very long.
[295:59.97]What happened?
[296:00.35]Give me a TLDR.
[296:03.27]Leon sucks, Ada sucks, T-virus sucks, G-virus sucks.
[296:07.72]FBI now involved, CIA.
[296:08.84]Okay.
[296:27.15]We have... We're at the final save point.
[296:32.95]I'm just kidding.
[296:36.49]Why do I still have these?
[296:38.17]I don't know.
[296:41.00]No, I wonder what... You got an item box with no save point.
[296:51.12]Why?
[296:51.32]It's kind of weird.
[297:00.09]Leave the... No, I'm not taking the magnum.
[297:01.29]I was just kidding.
[297:09.47]Map is the shape of a gun.
[297:11.76]Yeah, it is.
[297:22.00]What are the items?
[297:23.88]I'm just doing an item check.
[297:27.55]Do we drop some frames?
[297:30.49]No, it's alright.
[297:32.83]It's not even close to what it was like yesterday.
[297:34.71]It was horrible yesterday.
[297:38.37]Sweat check?
[297:39.33]Nah, I'm just kidding.
[297:42.05]For your safety, stand clear until the doors are fully open.
[297:48.91]For your safety, stand clear until the doors are fully open.
[297:53.15]Is this Dexter's lab, or is this... For your safety, stand clear until the doors are fully open.
[298:06.50]Welcome to Nest.
[298:08.56]Enjoy your visit.
[298:10.86]Thank you.
[298:12.52]You know, I think I will.
[298:14.81]Receptionist.
[298:15.51]Let's see.
[298:16.27]No, that's not an herb.
[298:19.15]Okay.
[298:20.45]I wonder where the G-Virus is.
[298:23.09]Uh, nap room.
[298:25.63]Toby... Entered 1203 and...
[298:33.36]Wayne.
[298:34.44]Desmond.
[298:35.68]I have to remember this shit.
[298:37.82]I have to remember this.
[298:40.10]So I'm gonna write that down.
[298:45.01]Uh, the truth is... In order to ensure employee safety, in order to enter and exit the file, you must use an ID wristband.
[298:53.03]Visitor, general staff, and senior staff.
[298:55.67]Authentication is granted based on an electronic chip inside the wristband.
[298:59.01]The wristband access level can be changed by simply inserting a different electronic chip.
[299:03.05]Visitor wristbands can be given to family members or employees.
[299:05.71]Please inquire at reception for further details.
[299:07.79]Nah, I'm just kidding.
[299:10.45]Well, what was the point of that item box that I just saw?
[299:13.49]Alright.
[299:20.21]More stuff.
[299:22.01]More stuff.
[299:34.13]that's good when's the local t-virus gonna come get me research lab north area map so we have cafeteria kitchen nap room which is we have to do a puzzle in here seems pretty good
[299:59.79]I'm not doing so hot on the ammo department.
[300:01.53]I'm gonna have to use some of these items I've been hoarding.
[300:04.87]And speaking of hoarding, there's a yellow liquid substance that has been building up inside of my body.
[300:11.84]And I gotta get it out.
[300:15.90]I'm telling you, scary games make me pee every, like, hour.
[300:18.18]And so does my terrible old person body.
[300:26.59]I've peed three times in five hours.
[300:31.18]I mean, I've been drinking, I've been drinking like a water of an hour, but, and every hour and a half, maybe?
[300:35.70]I pee three times in five hours.
[300:41.12]It's just, it's the, it's the, I'm getting, it's all the hydration is sapping out of my body because I'm screaming.
[300:51.12]That's two-third as much as you need.
[300:52.92]Well, why am I peeing so much?
[300:55.84]Anybody in here a doctor?
[300:58.62]I'll be right back.
[301:00.44]If anybody in here is a doctor, I've had my kidneys checked.
[301:07.22]I've had blood work.
[301:08.26]I've had my kidneys checked.
[301:09.12]Why am I peeing every fucking hour and a half?
[301:12.01]What the hell?
[301:15.96]So all the doctors, I mean, there's 3,050 people watching right now.
[301:20.74]My viewers are incredibly intelligent.
[301:22.90]I think there's at least 1,500 doctors here.
[301:25.37]So among the medical community, maybe you can come to consensus yourselves as to why, because I know that, you know, it is there.
[301:31.57]So I'll be right back.
[304:21.36]Hello.
[304:28.18]I got myself a Coke.
[304:29.33]I need something to sip on.
[304:36.35]Way better than Pepsi.
[304:38.27]Way better.
[304:50.72]Alright, what do we got?
[304:51.64]We got the wristband.
[304:59.95]Now, if you blindfold taste tested me, I'd probably say... I would probably say Coke was a little bit less acidic.
[305:10.48]Pepsi's like acidic.
[305:13.50]You can taste it in your nose.
[305:14.81]It's like a nasally acidic flavor where Coke is like a back of the tongue sugary deep flavor back here.
[305:20.93]Pepsi is up here.
[305:23.43]Coke is like back here.
[305:25.29]Like back here.
[305:25.89]Alright, I was already in here.
[305:37.32]Does it even say he seems fatter?
[305:40.14]Authorized staff only.
[305:41.64]Beyond this point.
[305:43.69]What are you talking about?
[305:44.58]He seems fatter.
[305:49.60]I think one of my eyes just crossed.
[305:55.60]One of my eyes just crossed over the other.
[305:58.52]It actually happened.
[306:12.91]Someone's gonna jump out of the boxes now.
[306:25.46]Liquor.
[306:31.57]Not quite.
[306:40.23]Oh, shit.
[306:41.64]Oh, shit.
[306:42.44]Oh, shit.
[306:43.30]Okay, hold on.
[306:44.62]There's a lot of people here now.
[306:47.28]I gotta get in there.
[306:48.22]There's, like, super gunpowder right there.
[306:50.40]Ah!
[307:11.48]Oh, shit!
[307:12.76]No, don't throw a grenade!
[307:25.71]Die!
[307:45.35]Oh damn, I wanted a knife.
[307:46.97]I just got an achievement.
[307:56.15]More fuel.
[307:57.06]Okay.
[307:58.30]How do I get across there?
[308:02.34]There's like bullets in the middle.
[308:05.94]Where the fuck are they?
[308:07.74]There.
[308:17.25]Access denied.
[308:18.13]There's a ladder in there.
[308:30.04]Just keep it.
[308:30.54]You can have it.
[308:31.14]Keep the knife.
[308:32.06]For all I care.
[308:32.72]You can have it.
[308:33.16]Keep it.
[308:34.98]What did I just get?
[308:35.86]I just got somebody else's watch.
[308:40.90]Oh, just eat a grenade and everybody explode.
[308:42.98]I'm so sick of this room.
[308:58.56]Turn around, turn the, why won't you do the quick turn?
[309:05.97]What the fuck was that?
[309:06.71]It wouldn't quick turn.
[309:07.43]All right, let's go.
[309:25.41]Other side of the kitchen.
[309:26.23]There's the large gunpowder.
[309:29.37]What does two large gunpowders get you?
[309:34.32]Anything good?
[309:37.32]Another knife.
[309:39.20]Good.
[309:39.36]I'll take it.
[309:39.82]Give me my knife back.
[309:59.57]Gives you two large bullets.
[310:04.52]Speaking of bullets, I'm going to need some pretty soon.
[310:11.42]Thank you.
[310:15.99]I don't want to use the shotgun yet.
[310:17.13]There's a new wristwatch, and...
[310:24.63]regular regular flame regulator for the flamethrower a custom part for the flamethrower restricts liquid fuel making it possible to fire for much longer chemical flamethrower I didn't even use it once so I get to use it for much longer good nothing in there um muff
[310:54.15]I don't think I... I don't have the necessary item for this.
[310:59.78]I don't.
[311:02.78]Although, you do have a new watch here.
[311:06.84]Electronic chip.
[311:07.78]You're going to combine that.
[311:09.12]So, where does it... Let's see what I can do with it.
[311:17.60]General Staff.
[311:21.43]So my security clearance is General Staff, which I think can go through this door and then probably this door.
[311:29.14]Okay, let's go.
[311:49.27]Someone's gonna... They wouldn't just let you get out straight away here.
[311:52.27]No way.
[311:54.59]Something's gonna be here.
[312:05.34]Okay, no?
[312:06.04]Good.
[312:07.72]Save it!
[312:08.44]Dr. Lee, your presence is urgently requested by Chief Cartwright in the East Area.
[312:15.62]Is the people here?
[312:16.36]Who the hell is still here?
[312:20.51]Fuel, 400 is max.
[312:27.77]So I have two large gunpowders now.
[312:32.31]So I asked a question and then didn't look at chat.
[312:35.29]Does combining two gunpowders, big ones, do anything interesting?
[312:39.71]Or no?
[312:44.47]It's lots of ammo.
[312:49.40]It's 50 pistol rounds.
[312:56.09]Wow, okay.
[312:57.87]Is that worth doing at this stage of the game?
[312:59.47]Do you think it's worth having like a really good supply of pistols?
[313:11.19]It literally says it on the screen.
[313:17.49]We'll see.
[313:18.94]If I get desperate, I can do it.
[313:21.38]But I still have plenty of ammo in this that I haven't even used, so... Anyway, I'm going to store it.
[313:33.97]I have plenty of... I've got a heal here.
[313:37.19]Don't need it just yet.
[313:38.17]I still have that tool.
[313:49.50]Why didn't I get this for PC?
[313:50.70]This is on PC.
[313:52.06]This is PC.
[313:55.82]Fill up the fuel.
[313:59.01]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[314:06.05]I'm playing with... Yeah, I'm playing with the controller.
[314:08.93]It's not so good for aim, but it's alright for... I like moving around in third person with the controller.
[314:16.85]Feels more organic to me.
[314:20.91]Well, this is different.
[314:22.47]Uh... Main shaft.
[314:29.47]Special forces recording.
[314:31.69]Target moving to west area.
[314:33.18]Must be going to retrieve the dream virus and antiviral agent.
[314:36.82]This is Ghost.
[314:37.92]Rendezvous at point W3.
[314:39.02]This is Alpha.
[314:43.50]I've got eyes on the target.
[314:44.32]He's gonna open the safe.
[314:46.12]Awaiting signal.
[314:47.97]Got eyes on the G-Virus.
[314:48.81]We're going in.
[314:49.71]Dr. Birkin, you'll come along with us quietly.
[314:52.47]G-Virus is in the west area.
[314:54.87]Got it.
[314:55.21]Alright.
[314:56.67]I need to go to the west area.
[315:03.20]Call up the elevator thing.
[315:10.54]That was neat.
[315:23.15]East?
[315:26.41]East?
[315:27.67]West?
[315:36.62]That ain't correct.
[315:43.53]Senior staff clearance required for bridge access.
[315:47.17]Can I go this way?
[315:52.80]I'm facing self.
[315:57.51]Why would you build the facility like this?
[315:59.11]You come in that door.
[316:01.41]That just seems strange.
[316:09.20]You're looking from the self.
[316:12.18]Yeah, but this is how you come in.
[316:16.48]some idiot made this place not as smart as me I would have made it a little bit cooler than this I would have had like streamers in every room streaming to their twitch channels nobody thought that was funny it's okay an nv design
[316:51.85]And you're talking about a place that has like the Las Vegas strip Design is pretty damn cool Ferris wheel you seen the light up Ferris wheel.
[317:00.48]I'll take a Nevada design Well now I can make another one of these
[317:16.15]I still have one of these already made, but I'm just for some reason not doing it.
[317:20.57]Look at how many of these I have.
[317:22.73]One, two, three, four, five full heals.
[317:36.40]More gunpowder.
[317:38.10]Good.
[317:42.26]That's four?
[317:57.66]Never make fun of me again.
[317:59.88]That goes for all of you.
[318:02.00]That goes for all of you.
[318:06.50]There's two there.
[318:08.76]This is a full heal.
[318:11.74]So that's one full heal.
[318:14.21]In here I have one, two, three, four full heals.
[318:18.37]So that would mean I have five full heals.
[318:22.43]Isn't that interesting?
[318:34.40]It's not interesting.
[318:35.68]Well, it is.
[318:36.13]Okay.
[318:37.03]I touched the mouse, and now all of a sudden I can't use my controller.
[318:43.37]Alright.
[318:43.69]Let's take a look at the map.
[318:46.65]We are here.
[318:47.85]They can go lobby.
[318:49.07]Let's go straight through.
[318:54.15]Straight through.
[318:58.05]Never mind.
[318:59.29]How about over here?
[319:05.63]Oh, no.
[319:06.23]Okay.
[319:06.55]That thing's gonna break out of the glass.
[319:13.48]Flower astronaut thing.
[319:23.29]Ah, that's so creepy.
[319:24.27]Don't.
[319:24.73]Just go.
[319:28.19]Activated?
[319:28.59]I need to upgrade my wristband.
[319:43.33]Shit.
[319:45.37]Shit.
[319:47.18]Ah.
[319:53.14]Okay, I got shotgun shells here.
[319:57.38]Uh-oh.
[320:00.16]Here they come.
[320:02.60]You gotta shoot them in their pustules.
[320:16.40]That's kinda hard to do.
[320:18.32]With a controller in my damn hand.
[320:30.43]Alright, poison him.
[320:38.73]Shoot left postule.
[320:40.26]Shoot right postule.
[320:43.44]A cartridge for dispersing various solutions in the greenhouse.
[320:48.40]Okay.
[320:50.66]Anything else in here?
[320:51.54]There's a map of the whole area.
[320:58.97]Input code.
[320:59.69]Uh, what Tetris... I have no idea.
[321:09.62]I will not know for at least probably a little while.
[321:15.24]So I got the greenhouse thing.
[321:19.46]Solution sprinkler.
[321:21.68]Control room.
[321:24.64]I can keep moving this way.
[321:28.68]I'm gonna have to... I'm gonna have to start burning stuff.
[321:41.94]Let's explore.
[321:46.03]Nothing this way.
[321:50.80]What about over here?
[321:59.78]I got four bullets.
[322:08.60]Watch out.
[322:09.24]Somebody in the vent?
[322:15.36]Alright, so I got two Minecraft shoes.
[322:20.51]Best piece in Tetris.
[322:23.29]Minecraft shoes, best Tetris piece.
[322:25.97]That's the first two.
[322:33.19]Herbicide synthesis.
[322:35.31]Plant 43 herbicide synthesis.
[322:36.97]Place an empty cartridge into the solution dispenser.
[322:39.17]Add the required amount of UM bead number 21.
[322:43.35]Cool it immediately.
[322:44.58]I almost just fucking drank out of this the wrong way and dumped it on myself.
[322:49.50]Thank god I stopped.
[322:55.11]Okay.
[322:59.01]So I need to... Place an empty cartridge.
[323:02.26]Add required amount of UMB number 21.
[323:04.38]I'm assuming I'll probably get that.
[323:09.44]So I need... Destroy plant 43.
[323:15.81]Looking for a chemical.
[323:21.69]More large gunpowder.
[323:24.63]Alright, I gotta start making bullets.
[323:26.93]Next box that I get to.
[323:28.95]Because I just have so many good gunpowders, I have to use them.
[323:43.46]Okay.
[323:52.10]Alright, let's see the map.
[323:53.56]Out here...
[323:57.19]Back into the greenhouse control room?
[323:58.89]I can't go out of here yet.
[324:02.79]What's going on?
[324:05.23]Why is everybody copy-posting?
[324:08.69]What happened?
[324:10.79]Nothing I can do over there.
[324:11.75]So I got to go back out.
[324:30.47]Take a look, I- I- I- there's probably some- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on!
[324:45.58]F. H. Minecraft Shoes.
[324:50.64]Okay, LEGO.
[324:52.72]Pause.
[324:53.82]Minecraft Shoes.
[324:54.60]LEGO.
[324:55.32]LEGO.
[324:55.68]Pause.
[324:56.00]Minecraft Shoes.
[324:56.72]LEGO.
[325:07.73]Uh-oh.
[325:10.31]All right, make him count.
[325:12.03]Make him count.
[325:19.65]Really?
[325:20.03]Burn!
[325:33.12]Oh, burn!
[325:37.19]Alright, I'm good.
[325:40.42]I think that was pretty good use of that.
[325:45.56]Didn't use very much.
[325:46.28]Alright, computer.
[325:53.19]No, where's the LEGO machine thing?
[325:54.97]Okay, so it was LEGO.
[325:59.41]Pause.
[325:59.87]Minecraft Shoes LEGO.
[326:03.67]Okay.
[326:06.14]That was unlocked.
[326:08.51]So I gotta go back over there.
[326:09.47]There's the save point.
[326:13.37]I'm gonna save it.
[326:25.14]No, I'm not.
[326:30.90]No, I'm not.
[326:31.44]Yes, I am.
[326:32.90]I can't leave.
[326:45.28]Oh, fuck.
[326:49.16]That's the wristband.
[326:53.72]So can I not take it?
[326:55.36]I think I have to destroy it to get it.
[326:57.57]Yep, makes sense.
[327:05.89]Good.
[327:09.21]Back through there.
[327:11.83]I unlocked that thing.
[327:14.34]Very good.
[327:16.52]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[327:21.04]Gotta watch out.
[327:21.73]I don't want to take an unnecessary hit here.
[327:23.57]You're kind of just blocking the whole way, aren't you?
[327:36.15]Unnecessary!
[327:37.29]Unnecessary!
[327:38.25]Do it!
[327:40.37]Unnecessary!
[327:57.85]Back up to where I was, and then there should be a ladder here now.
[328:02.84]Right?
[328:04.90]Mm-hmm.
[328:07.90]Here we go.
[328:09.91]You have 700 flame, but yeah, I'm gonna need it when I fight like a huge Mr. X.
[328:24.08]Research Lab East.
[328:25.94]Good.
[328:27.74]And then, what's this?
[328:29.28]More gunpowder.
[328:30.03]Fuck.
[328:31.69]Oh, fuck.
[328:32.33]I have to take care of this.
[328:33.79]I have to make ammo.
[328:36.13]I need to have my hoarding mentality just be destroyed.
[328:40.82]It's not good.
[328:53.47]Back in the lounge.
[329:07.96]You're alright Leon, calm down.
[329:12.22]Server room won't open.
[329:15.02]Probably need to open it with some unlockable thing.
[329:22.93]I don't- the music is doing this thing.
[329:24.59]It's stopping.
[329:25.61]I got so many items.
[329:39.08]What the hell is this?
[329:50.91]Trophy.
[329:56.15]When you find yourself in a scenario like this, I think I have to make the... Oh, herb.
[330:06.22]Good.
[330:06.96]Okay.
[330:07.40]Give me the trophy.
[330:11.68]So what the hell is this?
[330:13.04]Trophy in the shape of a DNA helix.
[330:18.18]And there's another code.
[330:22.72]I can look at it again, so I have another code for that.
[330:26.73]I'm going to walk over here and these fucking assholes are going to get up.
[330:35.47]Murph.
[330:37.91]Murph.
[330:42.09]It was Muff, then Murph.
[330:46.23]I'm just not sure what the hell that all means.
[330:57.56]An herb right behind me.
[330:58.54]God damn it.
[331:05.77]Alright, I need a box.
[331:10.29]Pronto.
[331:18.75]What is it?
[331:20.04]What is it?
[331:22.79]What is it?
[331:23.71]Why are you... That's what it is!
[331:30.98]Where the fuck did you come from?
[331:32.50]It's a grenade!
[331:33.42]You dead?
[331:56.31]Why did you not die from that?
[331:57.89]Explain it to me, somebody.
[332:27.91]There's like 30 people in this room.
[332:32.41]What do I have to do?
[332:33.31]Where the fuck did you even come from?
[332:40.86]You gotta be kidding me, man.
[332:42.24]Just get me the fuck out of here.
[332:47.80]Jesus Christ.
[332:51.00]Are you coming out of a fucking portal?
[332:52.76]What the, what, did...
[332:59.68]Unbelievable.
[333:07.41]Where the fuck even am I?
[333:11.01]Just gonna dump like five enemies on me at the same time.
[333:13.89]With two lickers?
[333:22.32]Oh, you can fuck right off.
[333:23.94]For real.
[333:26.16]Anything even over there?
[333:47.10]Stop dropping people out of portals, Capcom.
[333:49.62]What the hell is this?
[333:52.66]You can't tell me that that guy didn't reliably come out of a fucking portal.
[334:12.73]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[334:25.99]Somebody's note.
[334:27.93]Everybody's turned.
[334:29.23]Vegefied.
[334:29.79]They keep going back again and again.
[334:31.01]Burn them all.
[334:31.71]Burn them all until their body is black as ash.
[334:34.16]There's no other way.
[334:41.40]Oh god.
[334:42.28]This is the Murph thing.
[334:43.26]Can I get through this locked door?
[335:07.45]That's not effective.
[335:09.05]That was like almost 50 flamethrower ammo.
[335:13.45]Burn them all.
[335:14.35]Burn them!
[335:17.36]I'm dead.
[335:31.72]I'm so mad right now.
[335:33.14]Oh, I'm fucking furious.
[335:36.14]Somebody return sticks.
[335:44.61]Let me console aim for a second here.
[335:59.79]Oh, I had so many heals.
[336:08.69]This was my decision.
[336:09.79]Yes, and I'm gonna sleep in my fucking terrible bed that I've made.
[336:13.03]I'm gonna shit in my bed.
[336:24.70]I have to clean it up eventually.
[336:32.52]Do I have another heal in here that's not?
[336:38.90]Okay.
[336:40.14]So.
[336:41.35]Unfortunately, I have to use one of the superheals.
[336:45.63]So I'm gonna do high grade, high grade, yellow and yellow is a bunch of shotgun shells, right?
[336:58.19]No.
[336:59.12]No, it's Magnum.
[336:59.74]Okay, right.
[337:00.18]But that's important.
[337:02.58]Magnum is like what I want.
[337:05.40]I'm going to equip the Magnum and I'm going to make sure I use console aiming to hit precise fucking shots with the Magnum.
[337:17.71]Let's do it.
[337:21.85]Now I'm going to do... So gunpowder and large gunpowder doesn't matter.
[337:26.15]I think I want like some pistol ammo.
[337:28.61]Look at how much I have in here.
[337:29.57]I have too much.
[337:35.55]I could do... Console aiming and precise.
[337:43.08]It's just... It's alright.
[337:45.54]It's fine.
[337:50.38]I think I want some more shotgun.
[337:54.63]So I'm going to do shotgun.
[337:58.89]And then I'm going to do six shotgun.
[338:03.33]I think I want pistol as well.
[338:12.75]So too large gives me a bunch of handgun ammo, which I'm just going to do it.
[338:16.39]I don't think there's a reason to hoard this.
[338:21.68]I really don't think there is.
[338:22.50]What, are we dropping frames?
[338:31.56]Oh, we did.
[338:31.86]Oh well.
[338:32.32]Alright, let's, uh, let's do, we're gonna double.
[338:36.72]I'm gonna combine these two and make a shitload.
[338:40.54]That's actually very, very good.
[338:44.27]So what do I have now?
[338:45.01]Let's take some inventory.
[338:53.73]I need to get a better look at this, so hold on.
[339:00.23]Don't get cocky.
[339:04.05]At least now I have ammo to use.
[339:07.34]Let's get some fuel.
[339:10.82]400, that's good.
[339:11.42]Got 12 magnum ammo and 7 in the chamber.
[339:18.49]I need to take a couple of these, actually, because I'm almost dead.
[339:27.15]Bring the signal modifier.
[339:34.76]wooden boards.
[339:39.24]So that leaves me with this.
[339:41.06]I think I'm going to store these for now.
[339:45.45]Let's move some shit around so we got that.
[339:47.21]I don't have any more ammo for the shotgun.
[339:49.41]I have eight bullets in there.
[339:50.73]Got the modifying signal.
[339:53.97]Okay.
[339:55.39]Pretty good.
[339:57.27]I need to heal, but not yet.
[340:02.49]Not yet.
[340:07.54]Bring the wooden boards to fix the indoor windows.
[340:14.42]So I have another thing to punch in here.
[340:19.58]So there's the sprinkler, there's the control terminal.
[340:23.40]I have to go to the... Where did that thing say muff?
[340:30.86]Murph?
[340:31.40]Where was it?
[340:32.22]Murph?
[340:32.62]Muff?
[340:34.04]I don't think it was down here.
[340:35.04]I think it was somewhere else.
[340:42.88]There's not one in here.
[340:46.78]This requires senior staff.
[340:48.68]I gotta go to the nap room.
[341:23.86]He's not moving so much?
[341:28.95]He's dead.
[341:50.00]Alright, let's go.
[341:50.58]I don't need to heal yet.
[342:00.24]So that brings us to here.
[342:01.91]What was the... what was on the trophy?
[342:03.37]What was it?
[342:04.17]It was... What the heck was it?
[342:06.59]I don't remember.
[342:13.65]It was...
[342:20.03]I don't have the trophy with me.
[342:23.93]Burn plants.
[342:26.52]Good call.
[342:28.38]What the fuck?
[342:40.95]You done?
[342:41.91]What the fuck?
[342:44.21]Are you burnt?
[342:52.10]Are they burnt?
[342:59.68]That one is.
[343:05.78]Come on!
[343:07.00]Burn!
[343:09.08]Got it, okay.
[343:13.47]Gotta get them nice and crispy.
[343:16.19]Yeah, they're pretty crispy.
[343:22.76]So what was the Minecraft password here?
[343:25.29]Somebody remembers.
[343:26.27]It's okay.
[343:27.75]Go by number.
[343:29.41]So imagine 1, 2, 3 is up top, 4, 5, 6 in the middle, 7, 8, 9 in the bottom.
[343:33.47]I was wrong.
[343:46.37]I don't want to go get the trophy.
[343:50.82]Lego Paws Boots Lego.
[343:52.34]Lego?
[343:53.76]No, I did that one already.
[344:01.00]Is that it?
[344:02.08]No, I did this one.
[344:02.93]I already did that one.
[344:06.77]What was on the bottom of the trophy?
[344:17.41]I'm gonna have to go get the trophy.
[344:46.85]Okay, so people were writing random numbers.
[344:51.45]Let's see what it actually is.
[344:56.48]So it's boots.
[344:58.60]Which way?
[344:59.50]Spin it around.
[345:01.30]Just take the damn thing with me.
[345:02.40]I'll throw it in the trash when I'm done.
[345:15.87]He hates us.
[345:22.41]That one?
[345:40.05]That's the correct one.
[345:42.05]Drug testing lab is now open.
[345:45.98]Excellent.
[345:48.76]Now, can I get rid of the trophy?
[345:51.16]Yeah.
[345:57.71]Now I gotta go to the lab, which I need, um... I need, like, a solution or something, right?
[346:07.38]So through here... I didn't burn these guys, so unfortunately I'm probably gonna have to fight them again.
[346:13.08]I burned some of them, didn't I?
[346:15.94]I distinctly remember burning at least a couple of these guys.
[346:23.21]Alright, here's the drug lab.
[346:28.21]Alright, time to make a potion.
[346:29.19]So we're going to put this in.
[346:34.61]And... Manual mode engaged.
[346:38.26]Adjust amount of solution to match cartridge capacity.
[346:45.86]All right, I got to do the double dare family challenge thing where you got to get the milk over the line.
[347:40.26]Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[347:44.12]You gotta get a little bit, and then I gotta get a little bit.
[347:47.44]Mm-mm.
[348:03.21]Which one has a little bit only?
[348:05.57]I think I had it right, actually, the first time.
[348:13.39]Because one of them pissed out.
[348:14.53]Okay, I've got to fill this up.
[348:18.67]All the way.
[348:19.87]And then what happens if I do this?
[348:21.51]Okay.
[348:29.18]There's a little bit left in here.
[348:35.21]So I need... Hold on.
[348:36.29]So I need a full one of that and this little one.
[348:51.49]That's not enough.
[348:52.26]It needs to be those two.
[348:57.26]So the middle one and the right one are... are ready to go, but this one has to be drained.
[349:05.24]Is that going to do it?
[349:12.53]No, that's too much.
[349:13.11]Okay.
[349:18.69]Okay.
[349:24.18]That should be it.
[349:24.64]It is.
[349:33.34]Stop messing with the big gulp machine.
[349:42.15]The freezy machine.
[349:44.43]Dude, I'm doing- I'm doing the cra- I'm doing like fucking Coke, Pepsi, Sprite, 7up, I'm doing all of them.
[349:50.31]Fuck it.
[349:53.65]Hey.
[349:55.18]It's awesome.
[349:56.28]How's it taste?
[349:57.04]Pretty good, man.
[349:57.62]All right, so now I have that.
[350:05.71]So put that thing I just made into the machine, which will spit out the poison and I'll get the wristband and then we can get on with it, right?
[350:22.73]Caution for dispersing various solutions into the greenhouse.
[350:24.83]It's full of solution.
[350:31.20]Taking precautions here.
[350:33.94]I still have the signal modifier.
[350:39.88]Oh, it's one of these.
[350:40.57]I'm listening to Cheeto.
[351:07.42]Thank you!
[351:14.04]Oh, it's Muff.
[351:15.02]Okay, I get it.
[351:19.25]Muff.
[351:23.65]I gotta stand in front of them and do them.
[351:32.83]I get it.
[351:39.45]Alright.
[351:42.01]I have the solution.
[351:43.95]I'm going to go back out here into the greenhouse room.
[351:48.63]Sprinkle that shit where it needs to be sprinkled.
[351:53.40]And call it a day from there.
[351:54.82]Well, not call it a stream, but call it a day in the lab.
[352:03.06]Because this is going to destroy everything, right?
[352:07.33]This is the solution.
[352:09.01]Is this correct?
[352:10.07]I hope so.
[352:13.72]I'm gonna save it first, just in case I didn't do it right.
[352:15.68]Alright.
[352:36.86]I gotta chill it.
[352:37.52]Oh yeah, that's right.
[352:38.02]I gotta cool it down first.
[352:42.66]So now the question is, where was all that shit?
[352:50.57]How do I cool it down?
[352:51.55]Alright, here's a circuit breaker down here.
[353:06.16]So from here, I'm going to go this way.
[353:07.94]I want to find one of those muff circuit breakers.
[353:14.42]There's one in this area.
[353:16.88]Right here.
[353:17.16]Is that guy alive?
[353:19.80]I don't think so.
[353:25.94]This one doesn't work.
[353:26.66]It's not turned on.
[353:34.43]Now there was a couple enemies still down here.
[353:36.80]I think both the lickers are probably still alive, because they come back to life.
[353:41.64]So I gotta be careful, but I wanna find Murph.
[353:55.90]The hell?
[353:56.49]No.
[353:58.93]So straight through here, there's a circuit breaker at the very end of the hall here.
[354:11.87]Alright, no alive lickers, please.
[354:13.87]They're both dead.
[354:23.87]Alright, I think I'm safe.
[354:26.31]Alright, Murph.
[354:32.68]Son of a bitch.
[354:34.38]Okay.
[354:38.20]So, Murph.
[354:40.98]Examine.
[354:43.25]Let's do it on Murph.
[354:50.26]Murph.
[354:51.70]Stick it in.
[354:58.58]What did that do?
[354:59.36]Turn on the lights?
[355:04.66]Is that really all that did?
[355:09.66]Was there no reason for that?
[355:12.24]Besides just to turn on the lights?
[355:13.90]Oh, okay, server room.
[355:24.78]Uh, combat knife, good.
[355:26.50]I'll be sticking that in somebody's face very shortly.
[355:31.18]Anything else in the server room?
[355:34.24]Ooh, some paste.
[355:42.37]And some gamer fuel.
[355:48.53]Save point.
[355:52.52]You can almost host a Minecraft server.
[355:54.28]Almost.
[355:58.32]What can I make?
[355:58.96]I can do more magnum.
[356:01.10]No, I can do more shotgun.
[356:03.70]Which I think that's what I'm going to do.
[356:06.11]Yes, it is.
[356:07.59]More shotgun ammo.
[356:16.14]store this fuel so I got some gunpowder fuel I have do I have another gunpowder or just that's it 12 with 7 in the chamber that's a lot blue herb
[356:40.87]Some boards I'm going to keep.
[356:42.35]I'm going to hold on to that because I'll probably need it very soon.
[356:45.30]Okay.
[356:47.70]Looks good.
[356:49.16]Everybody loaded up.
[356:54.82]What playthrough is this?
[356:55.54]This is just my first playthrough at Leon.
[356:59.14]That's it.
[357:01.74]So I've done everything I can do in here.
[357:03.12]What about this way though?
[357:04.50]Is that door locked as well?
[357:12.34]Or did that open now because the lights are on?
[357:14.43]Let's find out.
[357:25.88]It is open, though.
[357:26.84]Good.
[357:31.72]Don't open that for this person.
[357:33.02]Come on.
[357:34.54]What are you, dumb?
[357:43.33]Low tan- ooooh!
[357:45.59]Cool it down, there is where I can cool it.
[357:51.88]Something's gonna appear in here, I know it.
[357:56.50]Lady's gonna get up.
[357:57.86]Welcome back, Dr. Lee.
[357:59.94]You have five new messages.
[358:06.51]Okay.
[358:09.43]So, what's in here?
[358:12.36]I thought that was a pack upgrade.
[358:14.90]Oh well.
[358:17.21]Can I not go in here?
[358:18.03]I feel like I'm going to get hurt if I go in there.
[358:23.53]Wayne Lee's Inbox.
[358:25.79]Can you believe that bastard Cartwright?
[358:27.83]Cool your jets, asshole.
[358:28.89]Well, I guess he's the boss.
[358:30.85]For now.
[358:31.97]Anyway, have you seen my Helix anywhere?
[358:33.60]I put the secret on the bottom.
[358:34.48]Let me know if you find it.
[358:39.99]Put together the budget estimate for the year after the next and get it done tonight.
[358:45.04]We're under attack.
[358:45.74]People are dead.
[358:46.32]The east area is cut off.
[358:47.38]We can't operate the bridge with the wristbands we have here.
[358:49.76]Where is that bastard Cartwright hiding?
[358:52.93]Plant 43 is going wild.
[358:54.09]The greenhouse is hell.
[358:54.89]We need to send someone in there before it's too late.
[358:57.93]Wayne, how do we stop this thing?
[358:59.33]You have to help us.
[359:00.17]Please reply.
[359:02.06]Remember Susie the Cheerleader?
[359:03.64]What a great gal.
[359:04.86]We were both into her.
[359:06.62]Of course, she wasn't into nerds.
[359:08.77]I still have to give you back those comics and games I borrowed, but you might have to wait a while.
[359:15.83]Alright, so I'm gonna go into the chill room.
[359:18.17]Hopefully I don't get chilled out.
[359:19.37]Alright, it is very cold in here, so let's just do it.
[359:26.36]Let's get it over with.
[359:29.92]Cooled it off.
[359:36.95]It's probably gonna take 30 or 40 seconds to do this and then I'm gonna get it intact.
[359:41.02]It's gonna take a couple minutes.
[359:50.80]Surprised.
[359:56.76]I don't drink it immediately.
[359:59.92]Just unscrew the cap and just pour it down your throat.
[360:03.79]Herbicide.
[360:04.83]Good.
[360:06.77]Cooling complete.
[360:11.75]Anything else in here?
[360:15.85]Really selling the whole chilly act.
[360:17.29]I like it.
[360:20.81]Yeah, there is gunpowder in here.
[360:25.51]Nothing else, though, besides just a random little gunpowder.
[360:31.36]There's a little side room, too, isn't there?
[360:34.30]No.
[360:34.84]That's it.
[360:37.08]Completely searched.
[360:48.64]You never fucking know.
[360:54.93]I'm waiting for somebody to explode through a wall or crash their computer.
[361:02.65]It's gonna happen.
[361:16.50]Nice.
[361:19.36]Make our way back up.
[361:20.99]I now have the herbicide.
[361:21.97]I can get the wristband to be able to go into the west.
[361:26.49]I knew you were there.
[361:27.27]I knew you weren't gonna let me come up here without a fight or an issue.
[361:53.19]Burn the body.
[362:02.13]Burn.
[362:11.88]Fucking hell.
[362:13.92]He really, he has great commentary.
[362:16.60]Not scared at all.
[362:17.60]Just irritated.
[362:19.62]Just slightly annoyed at everything that he's doing.
[362:27.92]Save it!
[362:31.44]Not like- WOAH!
[362:33.10]Well, holy shit, what the fuck is that thing?
[362:35.20]No.
[362:36.42]What the fuck?
[362:38.36]Fuckin' hell.
[362:41.06]He's... slightly annoyed at every enemy.
[362:45.07]Yeah, where are his YouTuber reactions?
[362:46.53]C'mon.
[362:49.87]Ohhhh... Should I just make- make some hangout ammo?
[362:57.51]Maybe.
[363:10.15]That's a decent stack.
[363:18.40]Cool.
[363:19.76]Ready to rock and roll.
[363:28.01]I think it's time to bring out Bad Boy.
[363:40.33]I am fully stacked.
[363:42.62]Don't use this, unless I need it.
[363:48.30]Something's coming up here, for sure.
[363:51.26]I'm in the lab.
[363:52.14]This is a secret.
[363:52.72]I'm in the lab.
[363:55.04]I'm about to... I'm about to turn this thing into jelly, and I'm gonna get the wristband.
[363:59.97]So, this thing's gonna attack.
[364:01.67]The giant tree monster's gonna fight me, and I'm gonna need to do one pinpoint headshot.
[364:11.21]Where's that thing?
[364:11.97]It's in here, right?
[364:12.69]Yeah.
[364:13.73]Sprinkler system.
[364:22.35]Through here.
[364:23.49]All right.
[364:27.08]It's time for you to die.
[364:31.66]Put it in.
[364:32.74]Let's see what happens.
[364:36.96]Dispensing solution now.
[364:40.79]Jeremy doesn't read chat.
[364:41.68]Where'd he go?
[364:43.96]I try to peek over there every 30 seconds.
[364:47.62]Every minute or so, I try to see what's going on in there.
[364:50.62]Just gotta... Gotta pay attention to the game, you know?
[364:54.47]Alright, let's go upgrade the wristband.
[364:56.25]Disciplinary measures.
[364:57.61]Oh no.
[364:58.15]I'm gonna get written up.
[365:12.51]So where did he go?
[365:14.27]He fell out there.
[365:15.55]Okay.
[365:17.08]You're gonna do this to me?
[365:17.94]You're not just gonna fall flat through?
[365:19.70]Of course not.
[365:28.64]I thought he was gonna go for the glass.
[365:32.21]Alright, let's clean it up.
[365:41.51]There's only one, I think, that's alive here.
[365:43.91]What the hell?
[365:51.63]There he is again.
[365:52.37]What the hell?
[365:56.55]Asshole.
[365:59.60]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[366:00.42]There's one coming up quick!
[366:20.52]Goodbye.
[366:28.17]Jesus.
[366:29.39]Oh, did it really... Just creep.
[366:35.75]You know what, just... Just fuck off.
[366:38.93]Shit!
[367:00.42]That guy alive?
[367:00.94]Electronic chip.
[367:03.39]That guy looks normal.
[367:05.83]What's with normal guy?
[367:06.85]Oh, no you don't.
[367:25.49]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[367:28.43]Out, out, out, out, out.
[367:29.87]Alright, hold on.
[367:30.73]I need to go to the senior staff PC.
[367:37.86]Get the fuck... Don't know if he's gonna break through a wall.
[367:48.66]I know he is.
[367:53.15]Fuck, I gotta upgrade the dumb watch.
[367:57.41]Okay, seeing your staff.
[367:58.33]I don't want to read you guys' emails right now, but I'm apparently reading emails.
[368:04.88]When did Ness become a nest for spies?
[368:06.80]Three last month.
[368:09.00]There are four this month.
[368:10.72]And those that are just the ones we caught.
[368:12.04]Step up security cart, right?
[368:13.06]Or do you want to end up like your predecessor?
[368:16.46]I'll be restricting access to the west area from today.
[368:18.85]Ignore all requests from headquarters for information on G. Those suits contribute nothing to this project.
[368:25.68]Auto-generate.
[368:26.22]Warning.
[368:26.48]Unauthorized access.
[368:28.09]Herbicide dispersal by unauthorized employee detected in the east area.
[368:31.01]Clear access.
[368:33.15]That's great.
[368:34.41]That's really great.
[368:35.39]Good to know.
[368:36.27]So I need to go out.
[368:37.11]We're going to save the game and I have to go... I can't believe this guy's still here.
[368:52.12]He's still following me around.
[368:54.28]Still trying to kill me.
[369:00.29]West area.
[369:03.83]I got a full heal in my... I'm going to take two.
[369:06.53]I feel like we could be getting somewhere here.
[369:13.52]Out to the west area.
[369:15.96]So let's just bang a right and make it across, and I have the access now.
[369:24.36]He's going to show up right here.
[369:32.50]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what?
[369:34.54]What's wrong?
[369:34.82]What's wrong?
[369:35.62]Modulator, modulator, modulator, modulator, modulator, modulator.
[369:38.98]I still need that thing?
[369:51.19]I mean, I guess, maybe.
[369:52.43]I'm kind of out of room.
[370:14.53]Why did I even look at him?
[370:16.44]Why did I open the door?
[370:18.12]What was the point of me doing that?
[370:19.42]I wanted to just make sure he was still alive and he was doing okay.
[370:27.05]Hey, he's still in there?
[370:27.73]Yeah, he is.
[370:37.36]West area.
[370:41.44]Yeah.
[370:42.50]Good luck.
[370:44.68]I can't pull this back.
[370:48.59]Oh, well, alright.
[370:50.47]Go to get the G-sample.
[370:54.75]What do I got for weapons?
[370:55.49]Everything loaded?
[370:58.00]Pretty good.
[371:10.46]Wait, what's everyone freaking out about?
[371:13.58]Use a modulator in the north room.
[371:18.12]Oh, God.
[371:19.58]This guy's coming to get me, and we're going to get secret items?
[371:38.83]No, I'm definitely not getting jebaited, because it's... It is listed right there.
[371:42.85]It is pretty close.
[371:48.90]It's right here.
[371:51.30]I'll just save it right here anyway, just in case... Mr. Man comes to get me.
[372:05.91]So it's just left, and then... Did I leave?
[372:09.23]There was enemies in here, wasn't there?
[372:10.55]No, not all the way down here.
[372:27.02]That was a funny zombie.
[372:29.22]That was kind of a funny zombie.
[372:30.54]Muff!
[372:48.49]What do I get?
[372:48.95]Nice, hip pouch.
[373:01.64]I think that's the final upgrade.
[373:08.26]Son of a bitch.
[373:19.53]What is this?
[373:21.29]Wayne Lee's Notes.
[373:24.51]Uh, dear God, blood everywhere.
[373:25.57]What the hell's happening?
[373:26.23]They're dead.
[373:26.71]All dead.
[373:27.15]It was those men in black.
[373:29.11]USS Headquarters Special Forces.
[373:31.49]But why?
[373:32.05]Isn't their job to protect us?
[373:33.27]White brains in a sea of red.
[373:34.80]This can't be happening.
[373:38.04]Dear God, why?
[373:38.70]Didn't everybody say I was a genius?
[373:40.20]A genius like me can't die in a place like this.
[373:42.36]I always got results.
[373:44.24]They're screwing me.
[373:44.96]Well, maybe...
[373:48.63]Well, maybe I'll screw them.
[373:49.61]I'll win the Nobel Prize.
[373:50.57]I'm a hero.
[373:52.09]A genius.
[373:52.51]A god.
[373:52.87]I will not die.
[373:53.62]Well, unfortunately, you did.
[374:00.60]And that's what I came back all the way back here for.
[374:03.82]Was an upgrade to my pouch.
[374:05.96]Got the pouch upgrade.
[374:09.68]Okay.
[374:18.96]It's time to go.
[374:23.72]Why do people always write in their diary when they're about to die?
[374:34.37]Because you want to leave the last thing.
[374:39.12]Right?
[374:39.34]You wanna leave, at least I gotta tell somebody my story right before, right?
[374:43.82]The apocalypse!
[374:45.38]You can hear like the zombies closing in and you're like, I got fucking something to tell you.
[374:48.91]I got something to say, whoever finds this.
[374:52.51]You know?
[374:56.79]So, I'm gonna hold on to this just because people will probably get angry if I throw it in the trash.
[375:01.92]Let's go.
[375:04.46]West.
[375:05.76]Hall.
[375:15.13]What would I write in my diary?
[375:17.41]Something ridiculous.
[375:18.77]Something really, really cryptic and weird.
[375:23.25]Okay, you guys know Mr. Satan from Dragon Ball Z?
[375:28.32]I would just pretend I was like a superhero or something.
[375:30.92]Like I fucking saved the day and shit.
[375:33.68]I'd write like a whole story about it.
[375:40.68]Here we go.
[375:46.82]There's a video cassette.
[375:49.50]And a grenade.
[375:50.14]Another videotape to go play.
[375:54.10]Oh, good.
[375:54.44]There's a player right here.
[375:59.15]What perfect timing for a videotape player.
[376:06.98]Good thing I brought it.
[376:07.58]Aus.
[376:09.20]Aus.
[376:24.38]us and there's the light good uh no save point but there is a box for some reason let's put that tape in and see that's it modulator is done I can't really get rid of it but we'll watch the tape quiet movie
[376:56.94]Got eyes on the G-virus.
[376:57.76]We're going in.
[377:07.09]Dr. Birkin, you'll come along with us quietly.
[377:09.91]You think I didn't know you were coming?
[377:13.87]This is my life's work.
[377:16.44]I'm not handing over anything.
[377:18.26]We have our orders, Dr. Birkin.
[377:27.47]What the fuck are you trying to do there?
[377:35.09]What the fuck were you thinking?
[377:37.34]Our orders were to bring him in alive.
[377:39.76]Yeah, come on, hunk.
[377:40.44]Get with the program.
[377:45.18]We're in, sir.
[377:46.32]But we had a snafu.
[377:48.18]Target resisted.
[377:49.24]We had to take him out.
[377:54.24]That's correct, sir.
[377:57.56]So they're gonna do a Hunk campaign.
[377:59.72]I hope they do.
[378:01.98]They've done it with every other game they've ever made.
[378:04.19]Besides, like, Resident Evil 7, right?
[378:06.45]Resident Evil 6?
[378:09.09]It's already in!
[378:10.57]Ooh.
[378:12.79]That's fucking cool.
[378:14.82]Everybody loves Hunk.
[378:23.70]So that leaves me with the lab here.
[378:28.35]The inbox of William Birkin decided to cease all research on G, which was ongoing at the Nest Underground Laboratory.
[378:35.91]All funding has been cut and Birkin has been removed from his post.
[378:41.97]Thank you for your mail, Dr. Birkin.
[378:43.17]Top brass has expressed an interest in this evolving bioweapon.
[378:49.33]Do not worry about costs.
[378:50.31]Our company is the most well-funded in the whole of the United States.
[378:54.16]Good news, G is almost ready.
[378:55.72]Strange you never thought to report to the research lab here at Umbrella, but I suppose I can't let that slide.
[379:00.58]Anyway, send over the data, would you?
[379:03.44]And don't worry, you've done good work on G, but we can take care of the rest.
[379:08.74]You're under suspicion of breaching your contract with Umbrella.
[379:12.01]It has become clear that you have claimed ownership of the G project and have been in unauthorized contact with the U.S.
[379:16.87]military.
[379:17.93]Please respond to the investigation committee's summons within 24 hours.
[379:28.42]Anything else in this room that I can do?
[379:36.76]Buy a reactor room.
[379:37.90]Okay.
[379:44.73]That scared me.
[379:47.01]Speaking of storing stuff.
[379:51.01]I have too much stuff in my inventory.
[379:53.05]But yeah, both of these can be destroyed.
[380:00.42]Don't need you anymore.
[380:02.21]Don't need you anymore.
[380:03.09]Let's put the blue herb away.
[380:14.11]Still have a full heal.
[380:15.55]I have two full heals in my... I've got full health.
[380:17.61]Three full heals.
[380:22.01]Not bad.
[380:27.45]F. Why is everybody saying F?
[380:29.99]F.
[380:31.87]Come on.
[380:49.43]I don't think I have anything else to... No, this is an important room.
[380:53.59]I'm going to go back and just put this in the box.
[381:02.71]I can't combine it with anything, so... I still have this plunger tool thing.
[381:08.62]I still have the... I don't know what that's for.
[381:11.34]I must have missed something in the office, or in the police station.
[381:14.14]Alright, here we go.
[381:17.34]Straight through.
[381:33.63]What the hell is that noise?
[381:49.84]Bioreactor room.
[381:53.66]Long way down, okay.
[381:56.72]Didn't do anything.
[382:08.96]Alright, here's the big reveal.
[382:13.27]This is the before you get on the ride.
[382:16.75]Weird, scary room where they start to blast music and start to talk to you.
[382:19.83]This is the before you get on the ride at Disney World.
[382:26.88]I'm ready.
[382:39.08]Creepy.
[382:41.44]Limbs, brains, eyes.
[382:47.51]More emails.
[382:49.61]After the G embryo was implanted in the subject, we made a 50 centimeter incision from the chest to the abdomen and began our observations.
[382:57.50]Subject's consciousness level was kept between 15, lucid,
[383:02.24]In GCS 10, however, the subject consciousness level deteriorated and further observation was deemed unnecessary.
[383:08.45]The subject was then disposed of.
[383:11.35]The G virus was administered to subject 501.
[383:14.97]They mutated into G form and was introduced to a group of 30 test subjects.
[383:20.44]After 2 hours 36 minutes, it was observed that all but one of the test subjects had been implanted with the embryo.
[383:28.37]All subjects were disposed of.
[383:30.13]One subject broke down during experimentation and took their own life.
[383:35.27]G-virus to 628, who had shown slight resistance to the T-virus.
[383:40.79]The virus was then introduced to subject 639, with whom 628 had a close relationship.
[383:45.62]628 showed some signs of resistance, but had been implanted with an embryo up to 24 minutes.
[383:51.24]T-virus resistance does nothing to stop the mental deterioration caused by the G-virus.
[384:01.47]A lot of numbers.
[384:02.29]I'm tired.
[384:10.18]It was.
[384:11.02]Okay, that was easy.
[384:19.11]I didn't look in here.
[384:22.63]There's like a... Okay, there's shit in here.
[384:25.41]Save it right now!
[384:26.41]Hurry up!
[384:30.21]Okay, uh, I need... Shotgun ammo?
[384:34.37]Shotgun ammo.
[384:43.65]Grenade.
[384:45.38]Okay, save it.
[384:46.16]Here we go, self-destruct sequence initiated.

[386:04.15]Oh, it's a deterioration gun.
[386:11.61]I get it.
[386:11.93]You called this thing William.
[386:17.86]Why?
[386:21.59]It shouldn't have been like this.
[386:25.27]It's Umbrella's fault, this whole mess.
[386:28.69]You're Umbrella, too.
[386:30.54]You're telling me you weren't involved in this.
[386:32.38]Yes.
[386:32.72]Weren't you just fucking locking Ada away and being evil?
[386:34.74]But we never meant for this to happen.
[386:37.38]You just tried to incinerate somebody.
[386:39.14]Tell me everything.
[386:39.82]Like an hour and a half ago.
[386:40.82]Right from the start.
[386:41.94]You're at fault here?
[386:49.43]You don't get away that easily.
[386:56.67]He injected himself.
[387:07.31]Good God, William.
[387:09.61]What have you done?
[387:14.05]Sometimes the hardest decisions take the strongest ones.
[387:17.63]We made the G-Virus, but we never intended... You can spin it any way you want.
[387:22.21]You're still responsible.
[387:26.41]Why did you make him stronger?
[387:36.42]Oh, God.
[387:37.52]Now he's super strong.
[387:39.26]The hell?

[394:53.64]Absolute godly gamer you are.
[394:59.02]Oh, by the way, spoilers for Resident Evil 2 if you've never played it before because this is the end of the game.
[395:04.31]Sorry for those that... Well, there's two stories, though.

[395:24.45]He's fucking awesome.
[395:25.49]Alright, so, uh... How do I... I gotta get out of here.
[395:30.47]What if there's still... There's still a loose end here.
[395:32.53]Where's, um... Where's the other guy?
[395:36.39]Where's Mr. X?
[395:39.13]I have to... There's another fight coming up here with Mr. X. Give me my heals.
[395:52.01]I got full everything, right?
[395:53.57]Two full heals.
[395:57.30]I still got six bullets.
[396:00.88]Did I save it?
[396:02.56]When did it save?
[396:03.10]Alright, Mr. X is going to be in the elevator and I'm going to shoot him right in the head.
[396:23.56]Where is it?
[396:24.04]This is the ultimate bait, right?
[396:43.87]Let me verify the G-sample.
[396:45.07]We get the hell out of here.
[396:46.17]Before we do that, I ran into Annette.
[396:49.41]She's bad.
[396:50.57]She claims you're not FBI.
[396:52.18]Wesker, the guy with the glasses.
[396:55.34]Oh, Leon.
[396:59.40]Why couldn't you just hand over the sample?
[397:01.22]Yeah, damn.
[397:01.74]You should have gotten it sooner.
[397:02.76]I realized as much as I wanted to trust you, I didn't.
[397:08.41]I really hoped it wouldn't end up like this.
[397:11.29]Can we have this conversation on the other platform?
[397:13.85]This one's kind of collapsing.
[397:15.15]Can you, like, email me the details here?
[397:16.41]But I don't think you can.
[397:49.89]It was Mr. Rex.
[397:54.23]Ada.
[397:58.65]Let her fall.
[398:00.54]Let her fall.
[398:02.64]Let her fall.
[398:04.14]No one gets that sample now.
[398:13.73]You're about to get shot.
[398:14.63]Oh, Leon, help me.
[398:17.37]Yeah.
[398:17.53]Hold on.
[398:22.73]Here we go.

[398:23.41]See you around, kid.
[398:25.65]No!
[399:03.06]I lived, though.
[399:04.08]See, I grabbed onto the chair.
[399:05.06]Alright, final battle with Mr. X. Let's do it.
[399:24.13]Escape the lab!
[399:29.71]Let's go!
[399:30.25]49 seconds!
[399:34.47]No, I got nine minutes to get out?
[399:38.55]Wait, what do you mean get out?
[399:40.17]Like I have nine and a half minutes to get out of everything.
[399:42.56]Out of like the, what do you mean everything?
[399:44.22]What do you mean everything?
[399:45.00]What do you mean get out?
[399:47.04]Get out of where?
[399:47.92]Where am I getting out from?
[399:48.78]Attention, self-destruct sequence initiated.
[399:56.22]Can the elevator go any faster?
[399:56.88]To evacuate immediately to the bottom of the train platform.
[400:05.85]You should have jumped.
[400:06.95]Okay, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[400:17.12]Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out.

[400:35.12]I've been doing the same shit you have from a different angle.
[400:37.94]Leon?
[400:40.03]You're down here too?
[400:41.55]Yeah.
[400:42.57]But the whole place is coming down.
[400:43.81]Do you have ten minutes?
[400:46.17]Yeah.
[400:46.73]You need to get out.
[400:48.07]Fast.
[400:48.85]Yeah.
[400:50.11]There's a way out.
[400:53.83]We can make it.
[400:56.79]Where are you now?
[400:58.79]Claire, are you still there?
[401:00.31]Leon?
[401:04.00]Hey Leon, you're breaking up.
[401:06.56]Forget about me.
[401:08.16]Just get out of here.
[401:11.90]Damn it.
[401:15.83]Wait, okay.
[401:16.97]First aid.

[404:09.00]What?!
[404:09.34]Okay, thanks for the shield cover.

[405:56.54]Is there a save point right there somewhere?
[405:58.22]Nope.
[406:07.85]No, don't pull it!
[406:13.01]I gotta fight him on here.
[406:23.58]Final battle.
[406:24.16]Oh, great.
[406:43.69]Shoot him in the ball sack?
[406:50.29]He has like a large ball sack.
[407:19.07]In the chest.
[407:20.23]Right in the chest.

[408:40.75]I don't even know what the fucking buttons are.
[408:52.22]Minutes until detonation.
[409:06.19]How do I skip this?
[409:19.18]Use the tool.
[409:19.80]It's not the tool.
[409:43.95]What is it with this thing?
[410:15.88]This is not good, not good, not good, not good.
[410:20.70]What?
[410:27.13]How many times does he do it?
[410:36.31]I ran into his path?
[410:37.29]How?
[410:41.28]Alright, so you shoot him in the heart.
[410:45.50]I'm supposed to be shooting him in the heart, right?
[410:47.12]Like, I'm doing that right.
[410:48.34]It's just the instant kill move.
[410:49.88]Just watch out.
[410:55.28]His arm.
[410:55.88]7.
[411:00.49]Move.
[411:04.21]MTA.
[411:05.65]Detonation.
[411:35.83]Alright, stop looking at chat!
[411:37.95]It's definitely the heart.
[411:38.91]It's not his flame arm.
[411:45.64]Six.
[412:04.71]Alright.
[412:12.18]Oh, not good.
[412:13.24]Not good.
[412:18.59]Dead again, aren't I?
[412:21.31]I'm gonna die again.
[412:38.18]How do I get to the inventory?
[412:39.04]I'm okay.
[412:44.55]How do I throw a flashbang on the computer?
[412:49.60]What is flashbang?
[412:50.34]I don't know what flashbang is.
[412:55.21]Space?
[413:13.68]I'm gonna heal.
[413:19.30]Where am I?
[413:21.16]Alright.
[413:21.66]Get it!
[413:42.83]I'm just going to shoot him one time in the mouth.
[413:47.12]Where did this come from?
[413:49.04]Oh, he's... I got room.
[413:57.41]What's he doing?
[414:14.69]It was very anti-climactic.
[414:17.13]He's gonna get back up, right?
[414:19.91]Do I have any... Okay, hold on.
[414:25.01]I have ammo.
[414:26.89]I got four minutes to get the fuck out of here.
[414:29.79]Exit.
[414:32.98]No, no, I ain't dealing with this one.
[414:36.02]Don't make me use a fucking rocket on you.
[414:39.02]Don't make me take out the rocket launcher.
[414:47.86]I'll do it!
[414:48.32]I'm just waiting for Mr. Rex to come back.
[415:06.07]I've got three more rockets with Mr. Rex's name on it.
[415:26.64]So... Don't need that anymore.
[415:32.69]Apparently.
[415:39.27]I'm not sure who I'm referring to.
[415:44.91]Is it supposed to be Ada?
[415:47.35]Man, that party was crazy last night.
[415:55.20]Get that wristband off.
[415:57.26]I can't get it off.
[415:58.12]You can never get those fucking things off.
[415:59.76]Comedy, right?
[416:01.99]Who the hell are these people?
[416:09.53]Who's the girl?
[416:15.85]That's abrupt.
[416:16.37]That's a very abrupt ending.
[416:25.89]That was... alright.
[416:38.29]Not even like a... ride a motorcycle into the mist?
[416:46.03]Alright, no, that's... alright, here you go, here's my thoughts.
[416:49.25]It was great.
[416:51.65]That was... that was great.
[416:55.17]That, like, two hour, hour and a half period where Mr. X, the tyrant, is just... won't leave you alone is some of the most intense, terrifying experiences I've ever played in a video game.
[417:11.28]It was fucking unbelievable.
[417:18.10]So this is the Claire campaign 2, which takes you through the events of the story from a completely different
[417:25.33]TV screen and You can see all the other stuff.
[417:29.49]There's a lot of other things that you places you go with Claire But for the purposes of tonight's stream And obviously yesterday's stream Leon that was what seven?
[417:42.37]Eight nine ten about like nine hours for the campaign ten hours for the campaign total somewhere between like eight to twelve hours for general playthrough, I guess and
[417:55.40]But I don't know if I would stream Claire.
[417:58.07]I don't know.
[417:59.95]Is there enough content to justify doing it all over again from another side?
[418:06.94]There is.
[418:10.24]There actually is, okay.
[418:14.13]It's the same levels, but it's different.
[418:26.88]I mean, yeah, I would assume that if they did the campaigns this way... I mean, in the first, the original game, it was kind of like that too, right?
[418:39.20]You played from two different perspectives.
[418:45.45]But that was great.
[418:47.97]Streaming-wise, we'll see if this is something that...
[418:51.96]We'll always kind of have it in the back pocket.
[418:54.60]Because I don't think I would... We've done Resident Evil 2 for the last two days in a row.
[418:59.48]I don't think I would want to do this like the next stream we do, right?
[419:05.94]Maybe.
[419:07.32]I don't know.
[419:08.00]It depends on how I feel.
[419:09.52]Not tomorrow.
[419:11.55]We'll be streaming next on... What's today's date?
[419:16.99]Let me see, let me see, let me see.
[419:18.77]Today is the 29th, so the next stream will be on Thursday.
[419:25.35]So nothing tomorrow.
[419:27.59]Except we'll get back on Thursday.
[419:29.37]Maybe I'll just do Claire.
[419:31.29]Or maybe I'll try to do some of the bonus stuff.
[419:35.46]If not, then there's a couple other things that are on the table.
[419:39.02]Still.
[419:40.52]But that was a fantastic game.
[419:41.56]That was great.
[419:42.50]Even just seeing, you know, maybe not even 50% of it.
[419:45.04]That was very, very good.
[419:49.80]It was worth the purchase for sure.
[419:52.36]Are we going to get a post-credits secret scene?
[419:56.52]Is that possible?
[420:01.30]Kingdom Hearts 3.
[420:02.60]I don't think I would ever stream that game.
[420:07.62]You can skip.
[420:08.46]So if I skip this, it's not going to skip the cutscene?
[420:13.38]You sure?
[420:15.44]Is that for real?
[420:17.70]It won't.
[420:18.38]It won't.
[420:47.58]Always a C.
[420:56.80]Assist mode?
[420:57.48]I didn't have assist mode on.
[420:58.48]I didn't have aim assist or anything.
[421:01.86]I told you, I'm a C or a B minus streamer.
[421:04.00]So, you kind of get what you're here for.
[421:11.94]Less than 10 hours.
[421:12.70]Yeah.
[421:13.00]Just out of curiosity.
[421:16.73]I want to see something.

[424:17.40]Oh yeah, yeah, for sure.
[424:18.27]Let's get out of Resident Evil 2.
[424:25.91]And let's scroll down to a little bit earlier today.
[424:30.08]We had... From Alec.
[424:35.94]Thank you, Alec, for the $1.
[424:36.60]Hello, hello.
[424:38.92]Yeah, Pacific time is really weird.
[424:39.94]Because when it's the daytime for me, sometimes it's like 11 to 12 o'clock at night for everybody else.
[425:03.06]So, that is just the nature of time zones, unfortunately.
[425:06.20]And I live across the world from a large amount of you.
[425:10.46]But I appreciate it nonetheless.
[425:11.62]Thank you.
[425:13.00]Thank you, Divas, for the $2.
[425:14.26]Thank you, Divas.
[425:15.96]Someguy, thank you for the $10, Someguy.
[425:18.92]So, I was going to post another meme video yesterday, but unfortunately, I had a retake today.
[425:23.11]So, I had to sleep.
[425:23.81]To make up for it, I'm going to make this a double whammy.
[425:26.29]A double whammy?
[425:26.81]What do you mean, meme?
[425:33.99]Phantom of the Opera.
[425:38.41]Why is that?
[425:38.83]How is that a meme?
[425:39.67]That's just the theme song to a play.
[425:46.90]It's just the Phantom of the Opera again.
[425:48.66]You just gave me... You just did it both.
[425:51.90]This is both the same video.
[425:55.28]Well, thank you.
[425:56.08]I... Thank you for the $10, some guy.
[425:58.78]Appreciate it.
[425:59.40]And Phantom of the Opera...
[426:01.70]Thank you.
[426:03.00]Anonymous, thanks for the $1, Anonymous.
[426:04.57]Hey, Jeremiah, I think the name you came up with last night for my duckling is amazing.
[426:08.01]Also, I wanted to say, I wanted to say stay still when shooting in this game for the, uh, the recticle to tighten for a chance of getting a crit headshot.
[426:18.33]Yeah, I figured, I did figure out somewhere about 78% of the way through the game that there's like a counter-strike aiming system where you just gotta stand still.
[426:29.27]I did pretty good.
[426:30.93]I only missed a little bit.
[426:33.31]Hey, Beef Wando, thanks for the $1.
[426:35.13]Thank you.
[426:36.51]YDNA, thank you for the $10, YDNA.
[426:38.59]Hey, Jerma, addressing the Pizza Hut versus Domino's chat a few streams ago, I just want to say that I've worked at Pizza Hut for three years, and that all the dough comes in frozen, and nothing is made fresh.
[426:50.59]If you have the $5 menu where you're at, it's a big fucking steal.
[426:58.99]Yeah, but that doesn't mean I don't like the pizza.
[427:02.61]Just because it's frozen doesn't mean I don't, I can't, you know what I mean?
[427:05.93]It still tastes good.
[427:07.47]Stuffed crust pizza.
[427:10.34]Look, nobody goes to Pizza Hut and thinking a stuffed crust pizza is some organically made product.
[427:17.94]I know what comes off of a truck frozen.
[427:20.10]You can't put cheese in a crust like that.
[427:23.90]It has to be manufactured.
[427:27.86]It's gross, don't eat it.
[427:30.42]I can't, I have to.
[427:32.42]I know it's probably bad.
[427:36.04]He's so upset!
[427:37.78]I'm not upset, it's just I love stuffed crust pizza and I've only got to eat it like once every couple of years.
[427:47.39]But I love it.
[427:49.79]I wouldn't say, I don't think Pizza Hut's the best pizza ever.
[427:52.38]I would put it pretty far down on the chain.
[427:56.73]of restaurants, right?
[427:57.63]But it doesn't mean I don't like it.
[428:00.25]Hey WePhone, thank you for the $1.
[428:02.07]Sorry for some things I say in chat.
[428:03.51]I feel like I can make comments that I think are appropriate, but looking back, they could possibly sound mean-spirited or even just completely off-topic and I just vent.
[428:11.51]Sometimes I forget people, especially you, can read and it's not the place for that kind of stuff.
[428:17.17]I just get a little wild and don't always think before I say things.
[428:20.90]Do you remember Pluto?
[428:23.38]That's okay.
[428:24.02]See, here's the thing.
[428:26.11]If you do something that maybe you shouldn't have done or you think back, you have the wherewithal to think back and understand that what you're doing might not be right or might not be appropriate, right?
[428:40.90]So give yourself the credit that at least you're looking back and are trying to improve on maybe some things that you might say.
[428:48.01]I'm not saying that I don't... 99% of everything that's in this chat I know is just for fun and a joke.
[428:54.29]Trust me, I know it.
[428:58.63]Jeremy, you keep bumping the mic.
[429:00.41]Oh, fuck.
[429:00.89]I'm sorry.
[429:02.45]But no, I know that people are just fucking around, so don't worry about that.
[429:07.39]Just know that it's good that you have, like I said, the wherewithal to step back and take a look at what you're saying.
[429:14.10]Thank you for the $1.
[429:16.44]Thank you.
[429:16.96]Howdy.
[429:17.96]I'm Chad for the $10.
[429:20.08]Thank you for the $10, Chad.
[429:22.18]Hey Jerma, I'm so thankful for your streams and the community around it.
[429:24.80]If it wasn't for the Jerma Discord, I would not have met my amazing girlfriend.
[429:28.30]Really.
[429:29.36]We're both big fans and I'm happy we can share these streams together.
[429:32.51]You can add World's Most Compact Matchmaker to your list of records.
[429:36.93]Alright, that's awesome.
[429:42.21]That's really, really cool.
[429:43.81]I'm glad that worked out.
[429:46.01]That's awesome.
[429:48.47]And I didn't even do anything.
[429:52.23]Matchmaker?
[429:52.83]No, you guys just, you guys found each other.
[429:57.35]I wish you the best of luck.
[429:58.29]Thank you to the both of you.
[429:59.85]And thanks for the $10.
[430:02.23]RumbleLegs, thanks for the $30.
[430:03.25]Hey, Jerma, I love you and keep it up.
[430:05.19]By the way, you have a hairnet on.
[430:08.21]Not rumble, a numb... I said rumbles.
[430:12.15]That is not your name.
[430:13.31]It is NumbLegs9.
[430:19.50]But thank you for the $30, Jerma.
[430:23.68]A hair nut?
[430:24.16]I didn't have a hair nut on, but I really appreciate it.
[430:28.95]I watched your stream with my ex and she didn't laugh once.
[430:32.55]That's alright.
[430:34.69]Can't make everybody happy.
[430:35.93]Can't please everybody, right?
[430:40.84]Thank you, Dingo, for the $1.
[430:42.50]Somebody put a coffee cup in your hoodie.
[430:46.02]Oh, there are... Don't do that to me.
[430:48.66]I get angry.
[430:52.22]Yeah, I did hear about that.
[431:02.61]That's insane.
[431:05.23]That's the kind of weather where if you open up the door and walk outside, you movie, like, nitrogen freeze, right?
[431:11.38]Just be fucking careful, guys.
[431:12.98]Be safe.
[431:15.02]Don't stay out there for too long.
[431:16.32]At all, even.
[431:19.16]That's absolutely bonkers.
[431:21.96]Hey, Lentils!
[431:22.70]Thanks for the $1 lentils.
[431:23.78]Hey, Jeremy.
[431:24.40]Really glad you're playing this because I'm too much of a wimp to play Resident Evil.
[431:28.06]Hope your migraines go away soon.
[431:31.28]Yeah, thank you.
[431:31.92]I appreciate it.
[431:32.97]I felt pretty good today.
[431:35.23]Just been kind of headachy and slow the last week and a half.
[431:38.05]Some strange reason.
[431:38.85]I don't know why.
[431:40.95]Maybe it has to do with something to do with my sleep.
[431:44.59]But I'm good.
[431:46.52]Kind of back to normal at this point.
[431:48.88]But I appreciate the $1 and the concerns.
[431:52.22]Thank you T. Dog Red for the... Oops.
[431:59.18]Croacher, thanks for the five community subs earlier.
[432:01.51]Guild Hero, five community subs also.
[432:04.83]Community subs, community subs, lots of them.
[432:08.95]Keith Ward, thank you for the $1.
[432:13.59]Scariest, funniest shit that I've seen in a while.
[432:15.67]Nobody fucks with Jax.
[432:18.17]Wait, did I say that?
[432:21.60]When did I do that?
[432:22.34]What the fuck is wrong with me?
[432:29.80]Dork Cube, thanks for the $1.
[432:30.74]Oh boy, you made some fun sounds tonight.
[432:36.95]That Mr. X shit, I'm not kidding.
[432:40.57]That was not, I wasn't like playing it up.
[432:44.17]I was actually in fear.
[432:46.75]Total, complete fear.
[432:50.44]They knocked it out of the park.
[432:51.88]This is a great game.
[432:54.88]They did a great fucking job.
[432:56.39]I hope they do the same thing to Resident Evil 3.
[432:59.57]And hell, man, go back and do it to Resident Evil 1.
[433:02.29]Do it to all of them.
[433:03.51]This was very good.
[433:12.82]Did I play the original?
[433:13.70]A long time ago, yeah.
[433:16.29]But I was also kind of young and didn't get it.
[433:20.15]I was bad at the game.
[433:22.23]Well, you still are.
[433:23.17]Yeah, I know.
[433:24.98]But I mean, bad enough where I couldn't... I just didn't want to play it.
[433:27.78]I was too young to really care.
[433:29.32]I think I was like 15 or 16 when it came out.
[433:32.42]And I wasn't like that young, but... When did Resident Evil 2 come out?
[433:37.28]How old was I?
[433:39.04]14?
[433:39.06]I don't remember.
[433:44.27]Resident Evil 1 and 0 were remade already.
[433:47.85]Yeah, but they were remade in that same style of tank controls, right?
[433:53.20]I would love for them just to go through the list and do them all like this.
[434:00.44]At least three.
[434:01.06]At least do it at three.
[434:01.76]Because isn't three considered by most fans of the game franchise to be one of the worst ones in the whole series?
[434:12.71]From my understanding.
[434:13.65]Okay.
[434:19.76]I always thought the 3 was... 3 and 6 I thought were just... Nobody really liked them.
[434:28.46]It's 6.
[434:30.16]It's just 6.
[434:35.03]Yeah, I didn't like 6 either.
[434:35.97]6 was just... It didn't even feel like a Resident Evil game.
[434:41.69]It felt like a... It was kind of just shoot at other military guys, right?
[434:48.45]At least for a large portion of that game.
[434:56.80]But we'll move on.
[434:58.36]Thank you, Smelly Boy, for the two bucks.
[435:00.62]Germa IQ is such an underrated emote.
[435:04.43]Oh, I think it gets used fairly frequently.
[435:08.63]I see it all the time when I look over.
[435:11.68]But thank you, Smellyboy.
[435:12.46]Thank you, Jules, for the $1.
[435:13.71]Chat says, uh, save Marvin.
[435:16.99]Jermis shoots Marvin in face and then says, save the game.
[435:26.73]What?
[435:28.69]Uh, thank you, Ruckuspur, for the $1.
[435:31.67]I'm having too good of a time with this stream.
[435:34.32]I usually don't pay full attention to any stream, but I can't look away from this.
[435:37.86]I'm really happy you like Prison Evil 2.
[435:42.44]No, this is a blast.
[435:45.61]This is great.
[435:46.65]I had a great time.
[435:49.19]Thank you, David West, for the 10 bucks.
[435:52.73]They just say UWU.
[435:55.85]Thank you, Dave Vad, for the $10.
[435:59.44]Appreciate it.
[436:04.74]10 bucks.
[436:06.20]Smellyboy, thanks for the $1.
[436:07.30]Jeremy, please wake up.
[436:08.12]Jeremy, please just once for your daughter's birthday.
[436:11.12]What?
[436:12.46]FreudianWeapon, thanks for the $13, Freudian.
[436:15.14]You may have single-handedly got me interested in survival horror again.
[436:18.36]Resident Evil 2 looks great.
[436:19.58]Watching you get scared by Dick Tracy there was the highlight of my evening.
[436:23.88]Much love, JermaHeart.
[436:25.04]Have a great night.
[436:26.86]You as well, Freudian.
[436:29.43]I hope you do give it a try.
[436:32.51]Especially considering that
[436:34.64]This is a great game to stream, I think, and to watch.
[436:38.38]Because even if you watched me play the entire Leon campaign, you can just do Claire and you hadn't even seen any of it before.
[436:48.55]That's really cool.
[436:53.17]It's very, very cool.
[436:58.88]But thank you, Freudian, for the 13 bucks.
[437:01.73]It's a great game.
[437:03.27]And Frodeon came- Again, you had five community subs right after that.
[437:06.47]Thank you.
[437:09.66]Also, another dollar from Frodeon.
[437:11.78]Who are you and what are you doing here?
[437:14.24]Wait, hold on.
[437:14.72]Everybody got really upset at me.
[437:17.58]Because, like, my favorite NPC in Resident Evil 2 shows up and I, like, start talking about it and all of a sudden... All of a sudden, like, I'm the bad guy.
[437:34.48]Thank you, though.
[437:35.42]Thank you, T-Dog, again, for the $1.
[437:37.58]Can we get some pogs in the chat for this intense gameplay?
[437:44.94]I bet that there was.
[437:45.64]There are probably so many pog champs.
[437:49.91]Dorkcube, thanks for the $1, Dorkcube.
[437:51.79]I know a weapon you could use against Mr. X. It's called, you know, that fire weapon.
[437:56.97]Oh, streamer, I can't remember what it's called.
[437:58.77]Can you think of any weapons that use fire?
[438:00.65]Ha ha ha ha.
[438:05.11]Oh yeah, what happened with the tool?
[438:08.36]I didn't even get to use it.
[438:15.68]There was nothing I could do with it.
[438:19.26]This is a debate, oh.
[438:20.02]Oh well.
[438:24.20]It didn't have a red check mark on it though.
[438:25.78]I could have used it somewhere else.
[438:28.64]You are a tool, get him out of here.
[438:32.86]Bam.
[438:36.11]Thank you, Dorkube.
[438:37.25]Uh, thank you, Kinky, for the $5.
[438:38.37]I've spent like $30 on you now, but it's all worth it.
[438:41.85]I love you, Father.
[438:43.47]Also, it's Puppo, not Poo-poo.
[438:46.59]Anyways, check out this website.
[438:48.15]You'll have to reload it, like, once, but it'll give some insight on your chat.
[438:53.82]I'm not gonna click on that.
[438:55.24]That is just... That's the Gnome headquarters.
[439:02.44]Why would you want me to click on Gnome HQ?
[439:08.49]thank you chicken parmesan for the ten dollars thank you chicken uh I want you to take a deep breath right now Jeremy you're doing fine thank you chicken I got over it I got over my fear hey robot mentality thanks for the one dollar the cap David thanks for one dollar you look extra cute I caught that one before but thank you
[439:34.21]Uh, Creation the Cyborg, thanks for the two dollars.
[439:37.29]Hey Jerma, guess what's happening tomorrow?
[439:38.69]Wii Shop and anything online related for the Wii will get shut down forever.
[439:42.91]Will you pay your respects to the Wii?
[439:45.19]P.S.
[439:45.45]The Wii Shop music will still be playable, but you can't go to the store itself.
[439:49.90]And anything the Wii U features online for the Wii is shut down too.
[439:53.62]So basically, it's the original Xbox Live shutdown for the Wii.
[440:00.68]I mean, whatever.
[440:10.43]It's like... What was on the Wii Shop?
[440:18.22]It's like... Wow!
[440:32.31]Mario Tennis?
[440:33.09]You can just get Mario Tennis.
[440:40.24]Un-something.
[440:40.90]Fuck you, Jeremiah.
[440:41.84]I'm just... Listen, let me tell you something.
[440:46.68]I think it's... I don't know why companies decide to open up these stores in the first place if they know that they're just going to close them.
[440:57.76]I think that's dumb.
[441:01.22]You know?
[441:02.23]Eventually, every digital store is probably going to turn off.
[441:08.89]But...
[441:10.07]But, for me personally, there's nothing on the Wii Shop that I am like, oh fuck, I can't do that anymore.
[441:23.81]I kind of got my fun out of the Wii.
[441:26.91]Now wait, this is important though, hold on.
[441:30.73]If you bought a game on the Wii Shop, is it still downloadable?
[441:36.25]Just not purchasable anymore?
[441:45.56]Like, let's say I bought, like, 10 games on the Wii Shop.
[441:49.86]Is it just- is it actually, like, they're not- they're closing it down, or all the servers are turning up and you can't even download it?
[442:01.09]You can only play the things you downloaded.
[442:04.19]You can't.
[442:04.75]You can't even- nope, servers are all shutting down.
[442:06.37]Alright, that- that's- that's- that fucking sucks.
[442:10.23]I didn't know- I- I was unaware of the details.
[442:14.68]I thought they were just closing the store, not turning off all the servers.
[442:21.46]I thought what people have been saying is like the store was closing.
[442:26.34]I apologize for that.
[442:27.18]I'm sorry about that.
[442:35.54]Yeah, that's like a terrible, scary reality of everything being digital.
[442:42.06]you know, 10, 20, 30 years from now, if it's not profitable for a company to keep what you've purchased online and they have the terms of service just to pull the plug on it, then, you know, all the things you ever purchased are impossible to ever receive ever again.
[442:57.43]That's kind of the digital world.
[442:58.85]That's the scary, weird reality we live in.
[443:05.86]If Steam were to turn its servers off tomorrow, I would lose out on
[443:13.85]hundreds of games if I couldn't play them.
[443:19.09]But the thing with Steam is you just... It's not... Those games would still function, but you just wouldn't be able to download them anymore.
[443:26.72]But still, you would lose out on your entire library.
[443:29.60]Thousands of dollars.
[443:31.72]Gone.
[443:31.94]Potentially.
[443:32.32]Potentially.
[443:38.06]You'd think that services like this would have some emergency sort of backup of everything and just have it available even if there's not very many servers.
[443:48.61]Because, like, let's put it this way.
[443:49.85]If you were going to go download, like, Mario Tennis for the Wii Shop, and it was going to take you a little while because, oh, shit.
[443:57.33]Oh, that's right.
[443:57.83]There's, like, 10 servers that are online.
[444:01.83]Not, like, 500.
[444:02.53]It's going to take me a few days.
[444:05.25]You probably still wouldn't, I mean, it would be annoying, but at least you could still do it.
[444:17.42]That's why you back them up, keep copies on archives, and that's not a concern.
[444:22.85]Yeah, unless you're using a service that stores everything.
[444:30.89]But that's unfortunate.
[444:32.25]I wasn't aware that it was not just a store, that it was literally anything.
[444:36.21]Everything related to Wii Online.
[444:38.30]The whole shop, the whole... everything.
[444:41.96]That sucks, but there's nothing I would really want to play.
[444:43.94]I played pretty much everything I wanted to.
[444:51.02]There'll be an emulator.
[444:51.82]There's an emulator for the games anyways.
[444:54.16]Yeah, that's where... That's why emulation is important.
[444:59.12]It is.
[445:00.22]Because there's... Backups of these pieces of media... That would just get kind of lost forever, wouldn't it?
[445:10.27]Decades, decades.
[445:11.21]I'm talking like a hundred years from now.
[445:16.23]We need that Library of Video Game Congress.
[445:26.06]Is the music muted?
[445:27.16]Uh, no, I just turned it down a little.
[445:30.60]But thank you, Peaceful Haley, for the $1.
[445:32.31]Hi, Jeremy in chat.
[445:33.71]Just want to say thank you for taking the time to read what I send about my career problems.
[445:37.85]Sorry if I keep repeating myself, but thank you for the advice and giving me hope.
[445:40.87]You're truly one of a kind person.
[445:42.25]Love you, Jerma.
[445:43.33]And chat.
[445:45.15]And really, it's great that you're saying that to chat, too.
[445:47.98]Chat is pretty fucking great.
[445:52.66]But thank you, Peaceful Haley.
[445:56.01]I'm happy to give anybody any kind of unprofessional advice.
[446:04.56]But I'm not.
[446:06.72]You're getting it from just some guy.
[446:08.62]You know?
[446:10.02]I don't want to pretend to be an expert on anything that I'm not.
[446:13.75]I can just tell you my opinions.
[446:15.67]That's pretty much it.
[446:17.15]But I really appreciate it.
[446:18.21]Thank you for the $1.00.
[446:21.89]And Stormichu gave $50.
[446:23.35]Let's touch upon it one more time.
[446:24.71]Stormichu, thank you for $50.
[446:25.93]Lots of laughs tonight.
[446:28.65]The stream's been great so far.
[446:31.30]And the Resident Evil scenario, or a baseball bat, definitely.
[446:35.76]Thank you.
[446:37.24]Thank you, Keith Ward, for the $1.
[446:38.82]As a doctor, my prognosis is that you're urinating more than usual due to the hang-on.
[446:43.72]My patients have all died because I've been watching Twitch for five hours.
[446:49.14]Thank you, Keith.
[446:51.41]Thank you, Ecliptic, for the $1.
[446:53.05]At one time, I was drinking so much coke, I could clean the toilet with my pee.
[446:56.25]That's disgusting.
[446:58.43]That is absolutely revolting.
[447:00.79]And I'm embarrassed and ashamed that I just read that out loud.
[447:05.58]Thank you, Tar Alucrin, for the $2.
[447:07.88]Dermot, you forgot to mute during one of your pee breaks.
[447:09.74]This is the new low for Even For You.
[447:58.28]Ah, my fucking stomach.
[448:05.98]I'm just sitting there going, ah, ah, yeah.
[448:11.44]Oh, that's fucking funny.
[448:12.54]Thank you for that.
[448:14.30]Thank you for the two bucks, Tara Alikrin and the great clip.
[448:18.86]Palasonic, thanks for the $1.
[448:19.82]Remember the entire chat was just convinced you were...
[448:24.64]I'm not going to read that.
[448:26.00]Thank you, Tara Olacrin, for the $1.25.
[448:27.18]Why does chat keep calling you a boomer?
[448:29.44]I don't think you're that loud.
[448:31.01]Thank you for the $3.25.
[448:40.53]Binaryman, thanks for the $5.
[448:43.49]Well, I forgot to set my alarm and slept through the entire stream until now.
[448:47.89]Derm of Pluto.
[448:48.65]And there's a YouTube, probably a gnome.
[448:56.20]What was that?
[449:01.05]Thank you Binary Man for the $5.
[449:05.49]Ethereal Seth, thanks for the $1.
[449:07.07]German, my friend said you ate poop on stream, but you seem... No, that didn't happen.
[449:13.83]Thank you... Yes is online.
[449:16.61]For the $3.
[449:17.11]Damn, I've missed a lot of streams because of work, but I'm glad you're playing Resident Evil 2.
[449:22.18]I had so much fun with it that I had to 100% it in two days.
[449:26.55]Thank God for vacation days.
[449:28.33]I've been in a massive creative slump for a long amount of time, and it inspires me to see you entertain on a pretty consistent basis.
[449:37.55]Thanks, and I hope that the green screen film my team's working on can repay all the entertainment you've given us.
[449:45.30]Whatever it is, I'm... I have no idea what I'm potentially in for.
[449:52.27]It's probably going to be crazy.
[449:54.21]So, looking forward to it.
[449:56.11]And yes, Resident Evil 2 is a great game.
[449:57.87]Thank you for the $3.
[450:00.76]YDNA, thank you for the $10.
[450:02.48]Leon looks like the main character from that Quiet Man game.
[450:06.28]Yes.
[450:09.24]Yes, he does.
[450:11.58]Thank you, YDNA, for the $10.
[450:14.22]And for the Quiet Man reference.
[450:17.39]Thank you, The Thrill, for $5.
[450:18.43]The Thrill.
[450:21.20]Longtime listener, first-time caller, 31 years ago, my older brother passed away.
[450:26.25]The smallest things like watching you streaming makes trying days like these easier to deal with.
[450:32.31]Much love.
[450:35.52]Thank you, The Thrill, for the $5.
[450:36.74]And I'm terribly sorry to hear that.
[450:48.04]If you can get anything from watching this stream, that makes me incredibly happy.
[450:51.36]Thank you.
[450:58.83]We got a great, we got a great thing going on here.
[451:00.81]And I'm really, really just absolutely, I'm just ecstatic that there's such a great community here.
[451:10.62]Thank you so much for the $5.
[451:11.40]Take care.
[451:15.71]And then we had the Demonic Cucumber for a dollar.
[451:17.91]I think it's really nice of you to continue his streams with a voice changer in video clips, Italics.
[451:22.64]It's nice that you're continuing it after his set in Stone Death.
[451:27.36]That would be something, wouldn't it?
[451:28.32]Can you imagine?
[451:31.00]If Italics was just doing this with a voice changer?
[451:34.82]It would be impossible.
[451:37.38]He has streams, too.
[451:38.04]Hey, Tingy, thanks for two bucks.
[451:40.91]I don't know what to say, so German Pluto is all.
[451:42.85]Why?
[451:43.15]What?
[451:45.05]Be sad?
[451:45.47]Why?
[451:46.49]Thank you for the two dollars, though, Tingy.
[451:49.71]A pin!
[451:50.29]Thanks for the one dollar pin.
[451:51.29]Jerma, I adopted two bunnies, and I was wondering if you could help me think of some names.
[451:56.49]They are both twins.
[451:58.61]Brown with black spots.
[451:59.99]The brother rabbit has...
[452:03.30]White paws, and the sister rabbit has a half-black face, if that helps.
[452:07.66]Thanks.
[452:08.86]Scrawny... Okay, so you have two rabbits.
[452:13.30]One of them is brown with black spots.
[452:15.22]The other one has a half... Okay, so... How about... How about cookie and... Cookie and crumb.
[452:27.61]Which one's bigger?
[452:29.31]The bigger one could be the cookie.
[452:30.95]The smaller one could be crumb.
[452:37.15]Easy.
[452:37.79]Done.
[452:38.91]You're gonna love him.
[452:41.56]But thank you, Pin, for the $1.
[452:44.22]Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $1.
[452:45.56]I can't believe Jerma stole his English joke from Inspector Gadget.
[452:48.66]His English joke from Inspector Gadget.
[452:50.96]Glad to have someone with more integrity in charge.
[452:53.47]What?
[452:55.25]Stole his learned English joke from Inspector Gadget?
[453:01.95]You sure did.
[453:02.79]There.
[453:06.51]I'm gonna get a fucking ad.
[453:07.39]Hold on.
[453:11.46]I have a full four and a half minute ad.
[453:14.98]No, I have like a... Hold on.
[453:18.51]I'm getting called out for it.
[453:19.41]I don't even know... How am I supposed to know what this is?
[453:24.22]This whole tour was fabulous.
[453:27.39]Never a dull moment.
[453:30.57]Even a last minute rescue.
[453:33.29]You guys sure put on a good show.
[453:36.63]Penny, you missed all the fun.
[453:38.64]Penny, you missed all the fun.
[453:41.00]I could have been Inspector Gadget.
[453:42.54]I do consulting work.
[453:43.36]Hire me.
[453:44.98]Uh, thank you, Demonic Cucumber, for the $1.
[453:48.14]Hey, 64 Fanatic, thanks for the $10.
[453:50.94]You wee screamed when X burst through the wall.
[453:54.40]Derma old.
[453:55.38]I'm sorry, there was dust in my throat.
[453:58.00]I was too scared and it was too much.
[454:00.80]But thank you, 64 Fanatic, for the $10.
[454:02.22]Uh, Dr. Epic Frag, thank you for the $1.
[454:05.78]Uh... If...
[454:12.46]Uh, Papa Murphy's is miles above every place near me.
[454:16.62]If you got one nearby, use that money I donated the other day for a $13 family size.
[454:20.92]They're well worth it compared to other places.
[454:25.02]Uh, I've never heard of it.
[454:28.48]German deflates, is this it?
[454:35.31]I have to go up the stairs anyways, so we're gonna go out, we're gonna go upstairs.
[454:38.35]So left, right, upstairs.
[454:56.73]Yeah, that error just kind of came up.
[455:03.24]Yeah.
[455:06.00]What a YouTuber.
[455:06.46]Thank you, Dr. Epic Frank.
[455:11.85]Something or other thanks to the $1.
[455:13.19]Who's your favorite Resident Evil character and why is it Tofu?
[455:15.69]It's actually... Uh... It's actually... Leon.
[455:22.37]No, it's not.
[455:23.48]Thank you Anonymous for the $1.
[455:25.04]So I literally just found this out.
[455:26.30]Apparently because of the people you sent over to my rescue stream, I'm about to be viable to become an affiliate.
[455:31.78]So thanks to you, I might be able to take in even more animals.
[455:34.22]As I'm betting you know there's always more rescues.
[455:37.09]Thanks again, truly.
[455:37.87]No, that's... Absolutely it's...
[455:44.21]You're doing a good thing.
[455:44.83]You're saving animals.
[455:47.31]Should be commended.
[455:49.60]But thank you so much and congratulations and good luck with the rest of the stream.
[455:55.75]Hey, Creation the Cyborg, thanks for the $1 of the store, and Netflix and YouTube on the Wii is shutting down actually later today at 12.01, and whatever you downloaded from the Wii Shop will be on your Wii forever.
[456:05.99]You can't get rid of them.
[456:07.25]Anything online Wii-related, like I mentioned, uh, but don't worry, X-Link may get their hands on the shop soon.
[456:17.16]Interesting, maybe they'll back it up.
[456:18.34]It'd be good.
[456:21.54]Uh, not very many more to go through.
[456:22.84]Thank you, Burnt Muffins for the two bucks.
[456:24.54]Hey, Jerma, I'm back from BMT.
[456:27.40]It was nice.
[456:30.20]Welcome back, Burnt Muffins.
[456:32.69]Thank you so much for the two dollars.
[456:33.89]Welcome back.
[456:39.19]Uh, I volunteered at a bunny shelter, man.
[456:40.73]They really need all the help they can get.
[456:42.13]I have a bunny shelter.
[456:48.05]When I worked at an animal shelter, it was kind of everything.
[456:51.86]I didn't know there was a very specific... just bunnies.
[456:55.62]That was Pin, by the way, that said that.
[456:58.78]I was unaware.
[457:00.12]But thank you so much, Burnt Muffins.
[457:01.22]Yeah, Dead Space is weird to me because I've seen half of it played.
[457:16.53]And then I've played, like, two hours, and I've watched somebody play the other, like, four hours.
[457:20.78]It's just, it's kind of all over the place to a point where I'm not sure I'd want to do it.
[457:24.84]I don't, I can't go in blind and... Oh, wow, I don't know what's gonna happen, because I know a bunch of the scares already.
[457:31.60]I know a bunch of the stuff already.
[457:33.82]So I don't know if it would be a great stream.
[457:36.52]But they are great games.
[457:37.64]They're very good.
[457:40.29]Thank you, CreationCyborg, again for the $1.
[457:41.99]Uh, you said you're an Ed, Edd, and Eddy fan.
[457:47.49]There's a game on PC.
[457:49.51]You should get it.
[457:50.09]I mean, Ed, Edd n Eddy is cool.
[457:56.23]It's a good show.
[458:03.04]I can't say I watched every episode of Ed, Edd n Eddy, but... It was good.
[458:08.94]It was good.
[458:11.99]The video game is awesome.
[458:14.97]And there's also one for Dreamcast.
[458:21.47]You know me, Jerma.
[458:22.61]Jeremy985.
[458:23.81]That's me, the guy that plays old, like, cartoon video games.
[458:27.74]We just play cartoon games.
[458:32.20]I don't think I've ever played any cartoon games.
[458:35.07]Why am I making that reference to myself?
[458:37.90]Uh, Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $1.
[458:39.44]Hey, Jerma.
[458:40.90]Uh, and then in brackets, Talix.
[458:42.16]I know we joke around here a lot, but I just want to say that your content genuinely gets me through the days sometimes.
[458:46.94]You bring so much to my day with your hilarious and heartwarming streams.
[458:51.26]And I know this is sentiment echoes with others in the community.
[458:55.09]From the bottom of my Jerma heart, thank you.
[458:57.39]Mind how you go.
[459:00.41]Thank you, Demonic Cucumber.
[459:02.85]And yeah, I get showered with such incredible comments and such praise.
[459:10.64]I wish there was more I could say.
[459:13.44]You've heard me say this a bunch of times.
[459:14.72]I wish there was something more I could say or do.
[459:17.46]But all I'm going to do is just continue to be here and hang out and stream and try to do my best.
[459:23.85]And that's not going to change.
[459:26.17]I don't know why it ever will or ever would.
[459:29.73]So thank you for being here.
[459:30.49]Thank you so much.
[459:32.82]You guys are amazing.
[459:34.98]Only a couple more.
[459:36.11]We have Nick.
[459:36.91]Thank you, Nick, for the $1.
[459:37.93]You're probably the person I look up to the most.
[459:42.37]That's... I don't even know how to respond to that.
[459:48.22]I'm so happy that you can take anything from this stream.
[459:53.90]It's such a nice thing to say to somebody.
[459:56.73]It's such an interesting thing to hear.
[460:00.38]I don't know what I can do.
[460:02.98]I don't know how I act or how I... You know, that's kind of... I essentially am at that place for you where I'm sort of on like a pedestal.
[460:14.96]And I'm not sure I want to be.
[460:16.56]I'd rather... I don't know.
[460:18.46]It's a weird feeling.
[460:21.31]Maybe the pedestal is not the right word.
[460:23.47]But...
[460:25.82]I just want us all collectively as a community and as a group to go as fast as we can on the highway.
[460:33.12]You know what I mean?
[460:33.96]Just like to go very fast.
[460:36.30]And then we slow down a little and... I want us all collectively to have a great time.
[460:43.97]And I just hope that you can get something out of the stream and I hope that... I guess it's just that maybe I'm like self-deprecating a little here.
[460:54.45]But I think I have to.
[460:56.23]Because it keeps me honest.
[461:00.47]It keeps my head on straight.
[461:03.44]And, you know, the nature of the business here, the nature of the online entertainment kind of world, I want to stay, I want to keep my head on.
[461:16.93]But that's an incredibly fucking nice thing to say.
[461:19.07]Thank you.
[461:23.24]Just say thanks.
[461:24.08]Yeah, I know, but... You gotta look at it from my perspective, though, right?
[461:32.39]There's a very specific thing that I want to do here.
[461:35.49]And... When people tell me that, you know, they look up to me so much, it's almost like I want to do more.
[461:51.53]But I do appreciate it.
[461:53.03]That somebody would say something like that about me.
[461:55.43]It's... It's incredible.
[461:57.27]Thank you.
[462:02.61]We all look up to you since you are the almighty tallest.
[462:07.69]Yeah, I fucking am.
[462:16.46]But thank you Shimmy Shim Sam for the... Shim... Shimmy... Shim...
[462:20.59]Thank you Shimmy Sham for the one dollar.
[462:22.69]Jeremy, did you see this tweet?
[462:23.59]It's very good.
[462:24.13]Let's take a look.
[462:28.23]Jeremy found dead in Raccoon City.
[462:30.28]Alright, that's a jack.
[462:35.56]Alright, that's a jack.
[462:46.48]That's fucking funny.
[462:50.15]Tag.
[462:51.48]Link that.
[462:53.60]Peak mic.
[462:54.22]Did I peak the mic at all today?
[462:57.32]Probably like 30 times.
[462:58.90]But thank you, Shibu Shaman.
[462:59.90]Thank you, tag, for the clip.
[463:03.71]I'm not a Raiders fan.
[463:04.49]Not yet, because they haven't really played.
[463:05.65]The stadium's going up.
[463:06.27]But we'll see.
[463:06.79]I'm more interested in baseball than I am in football.
[463:30.40]But once I play a couple of games, maybe try to get to one or two, see how they are.
[463:37.45]It's really interesting stuff going on in Vegas right now.
[463:40.39]Lots of development, lots of stuff is coming here.
[463:43.77]It's pretty great.
[463:45.84]Hey, Creation the Cyborg, thanks for the $1.
[463:48.92]You looked on Etsy with Ed, Edd, and Eddie.
[463:52.96]There's a Half-Life exclusive Half-Life grunt on Etsy
[464:02.11]There's an exclusive game for Ed, Edd, and Eddy that I forgot.
[464:08.63]I don't have any Half-Life stuff.
[464:15.48]Half-Life Exclusive, Half-Life Grunt, and Half-Life Paranoia.
[464:23.54]I'm not entirely certain of what you mean by this.
[464:28.64]But...
[464:31.89]Thank you for the $1 and... Gotta get some Half-Life... Figures.
[464:43.34]Or Half-Life... Not figures.
[464:44.82]Uh... Exclusive games.
[464:49.29]But thank you.
[464:50.03]Thank you, uh... Nick for the $1.
[464:51.75]I know it must be so weird to have people saying these things.
[464:53.79]I've been thinking about that.
[464:55.25]But anyway, literally just keep doing you because we love you for you.
[464:59.77]Yeah, sometimes I try to...
[465:02.27]give you guys an idea of what I mean by these things.
[465:05.41]I don't want to come off as ungrateful or rude or anything.
[465:09.85]I really don't.
[465:12.11]I like to keep myself as grounded and at least somewhat as, you know, transparent as I can with everybody here.
[465:21.60]But, you know, it helps when we all talk about it.
[465:27.02]Talk about any of your feelings, right?
[465:28.80]Let's talk about our feelings!
[465:32.39]I just hope you guys can understand.
[465:34.13]I don't mean it in a way of trying to be rude or trying to be disrespectful at all.
[465:39.77]But thank you.
[465:40.79]And then finally, Cola Man.
[465:43.02]Thank you, Cola Man.
[465:43.98]Appreciate it.
[465:51.06]And how does that make you feel?
[465:54.48]You're always grounded because of your height.
[465:57.06]Get that guy out of here.
[466:01.23]Let's do the credits.
[466:05.26]Resident Evil 2 was awesome.
[466:06.90]Really great.
[466:07.98]Wow, that was loud.
[466:09.04]I don't know why that was so loud.
[466:10.30]$2 from Creation Cyborg.
[466:16.89]Oh, it's two Half-Life games for the Dreamcast.
[466:22.93]I did not know they existed.
[466:27.94]You know who's got a lot of feelings?
[466:30.68]Blokes who bludgeon their wives to death with a goth trophy.
[466:34.46]Oh, that's the sniper, yeah.
[466:38.00]What a bunch of great characters.
[466:39.27]Are they ever going to do anything else?
[466:41.59]Are they going to make a Team Fortress telltale game?
[466:45.77]Where is that?
[466:54.81]Please don't.
[467:03.45]Yeah, we could get a TF2 Telltale game.
[467:08.78]Where there's only two choices that do anything, and each of the characters looks like they're on strings and being danced around like marionettes.
[467:18.94]It'd be great.
[467:25.33]That was mean.
[467:27.27]Wolf Among Us was good.
[467:29.58]The first Walking Dead game was good.
[467:31.96]I've heard tales from the... Borderlands was good.
[467:35.94]Eh.
[467:36.54]That was kind of mean.
[467:38.97]They made a lot of real bonehead moves.
[467:41.67]But they made a couple of pretty decent games.
[467:44.75]They did.
[468:01.58]Tails was fantastic.
[468:04.25]Yeah, I never played it.
[468:05.99]I was not, like, really a huge Borderlands fan, so... Thank you, Creation of the Cyborg, $2!
[468:12.63]TF2 was originally gonna be a DLC for Team Fortress Classic.
[468:16.58]So I can see that happening.
[468:22.54]Yeah, I'm glad TF2 took as long as it did.
[468:25.30]Because it was gonna be a completely different game.
[468:30.01]Good thing it took nine years to make.
[468:31.51]I clocked them at... 85!
[468:42.63]85 is how fast you were going.
[468:50.42]But thank you everybody, all the new subs and old subs.
[468:53.54]There are still... a shitload of people that are subbed to this channel.
[469:01.16]What an awful title this stream was.
[469:03.58]God, this is terrible.
[469:05.18]This is awful.
[469:06.90]Why didn't anybody tell me to change this?
[469:10.21]RE2P2.
[469:13.75]It's been like this for eight hours?
[469:16.59]Why didn't somebody tell me to change this?
[469:20.37]This was a placeholder title from when I was setting up the stream.
[469:29.26]That's the worst title I've probably ever had.
[469:35.90]Damn.
[469:37.04]All right.
[469:37.40]Well, I'll see you guys in a couple of days.
[469:40.44]Nothing tomorrow.
[469:41.75]Take care of yourselves.
[469:42.61]Resident Evil 2 is fantastic.
[469:44.65]And we'll see what we're going to do on Wednesday.
[469:48.23]Much love to you.
[469:49.50]See you real soon.
[469:51.42]Take care, guys.
[469:52.44]Have a wonderful day.
[469:54.04]Have a wonderful night.
[470:06.33]Oh my god, t-shirts.
[470:07.93]Right.
[470:08.39]Fuck.
[470:08.81]Okay.
[470:09.47]Um, hold on.
[470:11.56]The t- oh, man.
[470:12.84]We didn't- hold on a minute.
[470:14.60]T-shirts.
[470:16.83]I have two shirts.
[470:18.67]Glue Man is returning.
[470:20.41]Permanently.
[470:22.01]And the Jerma Solar System is the new t-shirt that's coming out.
[470:26.13]It was going to be either today or tomorrow, but since I'm not streaming tomorrow, I'm just going to hold off on it.
[470:31.89]And I'm going to launch, it's going to be a storefront on Teespring.
[470:35.95]And they will both be permanently available.
[470:39.49]At least for... I mean, we'll see how long the store can last.
[470:44.45]But they're not going to be taken down for a long time.
[470:48.04]Thursday, at the beginning of the stream, I will link to the storefront and there they will be.
[470:56.47]The shirts are planning, I'm planning on the shirts being 20 bucks.
[471:01.09]I actually was on the Teespring website and they changed some of their materials.
[471:05.07]They changed the way that they made, that you can design shirts now.
[471:08.11]They got rid of some of those shirts from before, but I still think that I can do $20 with like the premium t-shirt.
[471:15.85]Because last time I did the premium t-shirt and $20 was still fine for all the overhead.
[471:24.50]So they changed some things.
[471:26.22]I still think it's going to be possible.
[471:28.80]So it should be one of those nice premium shirts for $20.
[471:36.70]Thursday.
[471:37.16]And yes, I will tweet it.
[471:38.80]I'm going to tweet it out.
[471:39.63]There'll be a command in the chat for it.
[471:42.01]For it.
[471:43.51]Forever, I guess.
[471:45.09]Or at least for the first couple months.
[471:53.43]What's it?
[471:54.13]Gildan?
[471:54.71]What's it?
[471:55.85]Gildan.
[471:58.73]No, they have... Did Teespring change this shit?
[472:02.23]Should I be laughing at that?
[472:11.30]What is the Teespring Premium shirt?
[472:13.46]Is that what everyone's laughing about?
[472:14.51]I don't know, everybody.
[472:19.99]I mean like the one, the two one guys.
[472:25.39]I have no idea.
[472:27.29]Yeah, I'm trying to figure that out, but it should be 20 bucks.
[472:31.71]See you on Thursday.
[472:32.35]We'll talk about some more.
[472:35.29]Take care.
[472:35.63]Okay, bye now for real.
