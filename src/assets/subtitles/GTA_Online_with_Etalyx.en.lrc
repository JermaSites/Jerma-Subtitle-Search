[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.05]Uh, what do you think?
[00:00.63]How sweaty am I today?
[00:01.55]What do you guys think?
[00:02.01]Huh?
[00:04.65]Not bad.
[00:06.29]I'm starting to feel kind of sweaty right now.
[00:08.32]Are you?
[00:11.16]Um, we're alright looking.
[00:12.88]Okay.
[00:14.10]I don't have the light on over there, but, you know.
[00:18.14]Oh, let's get out of this.
[00:19.84]I've got two lights on my shiny, sweaty forehead.
[00:23.72]Are you face camming tonight?
[00:25.64]Yeah.
[00:26.40]I facecam every night so everybody can look at my ugly mug.
[00:32.53]Say hello to my widow's beak.
[00:35.69]Yeah, I don't ever do facecam because I'm treacherous looking.
[00:40.09]Only when you do Mad Libs.
[00:44.28]Oh, that too, yeah.
[00:47.50]Alright.
[00:48.42]Hold on one second.
[00:49.54]Oh, there it is.
[00:52.98]GTA Online.
[00:54.92]Yeah.
[00:59.67]That that is a candle to the person that just asked that disgusting question.
[01:05.53]It's a candle.
[01:06.75]It's a candle.
[01:14.12]Double facecam with Etalyx.
[01:16.03]Just a double facecam.
[01:17.93]Nothing else.
[01:18.83]We don't even play a game.
[01:19.69]We just do double facecam.
[01:24.09]Okay.
[01:26.33]I'm at 71% validated.
[01:27.99]I look like a henchman in this black shirt.
[01:34.61]I can see that.
[01:37.95]My GTA is currently...
[01:42.52]There it is.
[01:43.88]Oh.
[01:44.34]Loud.
[01:44.82]Loud.
[01:45.08]Sorry.
[01:45.44]Loud.
[01:45.70]Loud.
[01:51.01]Very loud.
[01:59.68]Okay.
[02:03.36]Let's move this.
[02:07.20]Phase game ain't staying on.
[02:08.50]It's just here for now.
[02:13.14]I don't have my controller plugged in.
[02:14.38]I'm not even going to go get it.
[02:15.87]So we're just doing keyboard and mouse.
[02:17.55]We're just playing for like an hour, so who cares, right?
[02:21.61]Keyboard and mouse.
[02:23.79]This is something I don't know if I can do.
[02:26.97]Do you have a... I do.
[02:30.17]To be fair, though, I don't even know if I can play the game, so... I got to change my stream title.
[02:40.08]Well, if you can't, it was worth a shot, right?
[02:45.33]Yeah.
[02:48.67]I'm at 90% complete.
[02:53.13]Playing GTA with a keyboard is like playing a different game.
[02:56.47]It really is.
[02:59.23]It's a completely different game.
[03:04.23]But thanks to all you guys that are sticking around.
[03:05.62]I mean, those of you guys that were here just for the shenanigans on the Bigfoot stream.
[03:13.06]It was fun.
[03:13.76]It was funny.
[03:14.80]There was some funny things that happened.
[03:16.30]It was a fun time.
[03:18.70]So I think there'll be like an interesting video from that at least.
[03:24.14]At least.
[03:25.14]There'll be like something that can be used.
[03:28.52]But whatever.
[03:30.06]So that was the plan.
[03:32.44]And we're just going to wind down with some GTA.
[03:35.68]How do you wind down with GTA, Etalyx?
[03:43.17]You don't really wind down with GTA.
[03:45.01]You wind up.
[03:46.51]That's true.
[03:47.61]I have not played GTA V in over a year.
[03:50.54]Well, you are now.
[03:52.50]Maybe two.
[03:53.16]When did this game even come out?
[03:56.30]2013.
[03:56.36]I know.
[03:57.46]It seems like it just came out though still, doesn't it?
[03:59.68]Or is that weird?
[04:02.38]I feel like GTA is still a recent release, you know, but it's actually like four years old almost.
[04:07.95]That's true.
[04:09.97]Also, I'm getting a server error anytime I try to start.
[04:13.93]Server error?
[04:15.41]Yeah, from Social Club.
[04:17.61]Oh, Talc is getting Social Club.
[04:20.25]What does that mean?
[04:22.83]That's a scary thought.
[04:27.44]Go play Devil's Third.
[04:28.74]Uh, you know what I think it is?
[04:32.40]What is it?
[04:33.12]I think that it is something port-related with, um, antivirus.
[04:39.02]Is it really?
[04:40.26]Yeah.
[04:41.08]Well, I just got in.
[04:42.94]I wonder.
[04:44.62]Do you have the same antivirus that I do?
[04:46.04]You have Kaspersky, right?
[04:48.42]No.
[04:49.04]Oh, I thought you did.
[04:50.22]I have your old recommended one.
[04:52.14]Oh, the Bitdefender?
[04:53.40]Yep.
[04:54.36]I don't know what they did.
[04:55.04]They used to be really, really good.
[04:59.64]I don't know what they did.
[05:02.54]The return of the barefoot bandit?
[05:05.00]Possible.
[05:05.36]Actually, I need to turn this back up.
[05:07.66]It needs to be a little louder.
[05:19.10]Come out right out the door punch it.
[05:21.54]I guess we are keeping the face game on why not who cares?
[05:23.95]Sweat cam dude.
[05:28.07]I don't even know how to play this game with a keyboard mouse.
[05:32.17]I really don't It's like F to get in a car right?
[05:42.77]Alright.
[05:48.03]Oh, this is different.
[05:48.91]This is different with a keyboard.
[05:52.91]And you are right, by the way.
[05:53.81]I really want to get into this game, and I can't.
[05:56.15]Dude, you're right.
[05:56.69]Like, streaming this game at 60 FPS with, like, not the right preset.
[06:01.01]Is it breaking your computer right now?
[06:03.89]No, it's just barely not.
[06:06.71]But if it really wanted to, it could if it really wanted to.
[06:11.36]You wanna do one like the, once you get in, you wanna do one like the goofy Mario Kart races?
[06:15.38]Uh, you say, once you get in, with a lot of confidence.
[06:18.84]Well, if you get in.
[06:19.56]That's, that's, if you get in.
[06:22.49]I remember this, I remember this.
[06:24.33]This is why I never switch games midstream.
[06:26.97]Well, we were... They never work.
[06:28.05]Well, we, we were done with that one.
[06:29.21]I know, I know.
[06:30.19]I'm just messing around.
[06:31.51]This was the backup plan.
[06:34.32]This was the plan.
[06:35.16]This was the backup plan.
[06:36.40]This was what we both agreed to.
[06:38.82]I did not start it to see if it worked before.
[06:41.42]I should have done that.
[06:42.84]This was the backup plan.
[06:44.04]This was the plan.
[06:50.99]I'm going to go to one of those.
[06:52.25]Where are they?
[06:54.25]How do I get to the map?
[06:59.65]Stunt series.
[07:00.32]This is a stunt around the dog.
[07:01.62]I want to do this one again.
[07:02.48]This one was fun.
[07:05.06]Well, this sucks.
[07:08.54]This is an error from all the way back in 2016.
[07:13.53]Really?
[07:18.03]Somebody said... Can people let me walk on the street for once?
[07:22.11]Can I seriously just get to where I want to go right here?
[07:28.65]Oh, okay.
[07:29.22]I gotta find my files and I think I can fix it.
[07:34.17]Gotta find your files.
[07:35.85]Yeah, somebody said if your Social Club folder is in the wrong hard drive, then it won't work.
[07:42.45]Like, if you have multiple hard drives, where Steam, compared to where you're installing your games.
[07:47.29]Oh, okay.
[07:48.91]That would make sense.
[07:51.45]That would make sense.
[07:55.15]I'm gonna mute for you for a minute.
[07:56.87]I wanna say thanks to some peeps.
[08:00.83]Hunter again came in with $5 after giving that astronomical amount earlier.
[08:08.65]After giving $100, they give $5.
[08:10.15]Hunter says, Did you realize that Bigfoot was bleeding Nickelodeon green goo?
[08:15.15]He slimed you guys.
[08:18.03]Yeah, you shoot Bigfoot and he drops this, like, gack.
[08:24.01]That's fine.
[08:25.61]But thanks a lot, man.
[08:26.25]Thanks for the $5.
[08:26.57]Magpie says,
[08:29.67]Jerma, lean away from the mic during your tea break so we can hear you breathing.
[08:33.49]That was during the breathing joke.
[08:36.67]We got a lot of jokes.
[08:37.69]We had a lot of jokes tonight.
[08:40.90]Moo Moo.
[08:41.54]Oh, Moo means Moo.
[08:42.36]Thank you for the $15.
[08:43.50]Jerma, please remod this particular person so he doesn't develop trust issues from this experience.
[08:50.84]Well, thank you for the $15, but... No remods.
[08:52.14]No rewinds.
[09:01.62]And then again, thank you for the $3 magpie again.
[09:04.14]Much appreciated.
[09:06.19]Dedo says, sexy Bigfoot.
[09:08.57]Thank you for the $5, Dedo.
[09:09.23]$99. $99.
[09:12.84]And Vidiot.
[09:14.88]Vidiot gave 800 bits, $8 earlier, like this evening.
[09:19.48]Says, hey bud, glad to see you're doing well.
[09:21.34]Sorry I haven't subbed in a while.
[09:23.20]Got some extra cash to throw around and thought I'd send it your way.
[09:25.80]PS, shout out to the cat.
[09:27.86]Stay awesome.
[09:28.36]Well, thanks a lot, man.
[09:29.76]Thank you, Vidiot, for your generous $8.
[09:34.76]Much appreciated.
[09:37.16]And somebody just subbed.
[09:38.80]Thanks for all the subs.
[09:40.77]You guys rock.
[09:48.94]Well, if anything, people like you.
[09:53.96]People like you.
[09:57.39]He's still here.
[09:59.23]Well, I hope you had fun, dude.
[10:02.23]I do.
[10:03.27]That's all I care about here.
[10:05.93]Everybody can get silly sometimes.
[10:07.31]We can fuck around sometimes, but we all mean well.
[10:11.37]We all mean very well.
[10:18.19]And then Anal Medic with $6.
[10:21.98]Just gave me $6.
[10:23.28]And that's it.
[10:25.75]Well, thanks a lot, Anal Medic.
[10:28.87]Uh, Poker Burps is fine.
[10:29.79]Alright, I gotta pay attention to this now.
[10:45.58]Two days in a row, I've given 100 bits, and I skip over them.
[10:50.10]Well... I'm not skipping over them on purpose, it's just... The ones that I can see that stand out to me the most, that I can read... Are the ones that are more than, like, you know, 3 or 4.
[11:02.86]And I've talked about this before, and I'll address it again.
[11:07.66]Like... The whole sub thing, and the whole bit reading thing...
[11:13.32]I don't want to have to turn the stream into like... Just like a name stream where like I'm trying to pay attention to something that's going on on the screen and... It's getting harder and harder and harder lately.
[11:25.71]For me to keep up with every single sub and every single bit donation and stuff.
[11:30.60]And I'm trying to figure out a fair solution for everybody.
[11:34.26]But... I don't really ever want the stream to lose quality because...
[11:40.32]I'm either missing people's names and they're upset by it, or... I'm... Something's going on on the screen and I have to stop and look over and be like, oh shit, somebody just gave some money, like, who subscribed?
[11:50.58]It's something that I'm trying to figure out how to deal with.
[11:53.83]So... You know.
[11:58.03]And I don't know how I haven't crashed.
[11:59.19]I haven't paid any attention to this.
[12:02.81]I've paid zero attention to this game right now.
[12:07.71]And that's exactly what happens when you look off the screen.
[12:11.73]It's just a casual race on a moped, apparently.
[12:17.38]To Lucian is text-to-speech?
[12:18.98]No fucking way.
[12:20.70]I will never have text-to-speech.
[12:23.44]Text-to-speech just talks over the stream.
[12:27.19]Like, can you imagine, like, if... Can you imagine if, like, when Bigfoot, like, reached his hand in at the very beginning of the stream, there was just, like, some lady talking?
[12:34.49]Like, it would just be... It would just ruin the moment.
[12:38.33]And the fact that these streams are being cut into videos as well, I'm trying to figure out a solution where it doesn't take away from the quality of the stream, but people don't feel like I don't give a shit that they're giving money or they're subscribing, because I do.
[12:55.68]I really fucking do.
[12:58.00]I just never want to get it to a point where half the stream is not me playing a game or trying to do something fun or engaging.
[13:06.65]It's me saying names.
[13:09.19]I don't really want to get to that point.
[13:12.05]But I do appreciate every single fucking one of you guys.
[13:14.53]So, I just hope you understand that.
[13:17.47]I hope you realize that.
[13:18.27]I'm trying to figure out a solution.
[13:23.73]Nice air.
[13:28.19]Text-to-speech is awful.
[13:29.99]Text-to-speech just kind of just talks over the whole stream.
[13:34.27]And plus, something else you have to be careful with text-to-speech is people just, like, drop and spam on your stream.
[13:43.86]I can't... And I know there's filters for it.
[13:45.62]And how come that guy was so much faster than me?
[13:50.32]Why are these people all so much faster than me?
[13:56.03]Why am I on a pizza delivery moped?
[14:04.29]What?
[14:04.59]Did I not pick a motorcycle?
[14:09.27]What the fuck?
[14:19.22]Light candles?
[14:23.71]Etalyx Etalyx was in that lobby hey I did better than Etalyx Etalyx Etalyx didn't even get to play thank you gerfield that makes sense either way love you how's your day going so far it's been going great thank you thank you for the money 10 balls you gave you gave money over the last like fucking forever dude it's just it's really hard to not
[14:52.70]like, on one hand, you have, it's really important that people know that I give a shit, and I want to make people very aware of that, and I don't want you to ever think that I'm, like, using this stream for, like, fucking cash, and, like, a fucking cash flow, like, no, I, but on the other hand, I want the streams to be, like, at a high quality, you know, I don't want to
[15:18.03]have to spend all this time worrying about, like, okay, like, if I'm trying to do a, let's say me and Etalyx are trying to do, like, a bit and it's something I think is going to be funny or interesting or, let's say, during my, like, magician stream, right?
[15:30.44]Like, when I was doing the magic tricks.
[15:32.94]Like, that's what's important.
[15:34.20]Like, I want to make sure, like, something is fun for you guys to watch.
[15:36.94]I want you guys to watch something and think it's fun.
[15:39.54]I think about that every fucking day.
[15:42.03]So, that's not something I ever want to do is, like, is lock that up.
[15:45.93]So, you know,
[15:49.21]And I'm just ranting.
[15:50.01]I'm just like fucking ranting now.
[15:51.88]So.
[15:56.72]Show us your tax returns.
[15:58.38]You guys ever see my tax returns?
[16:01.59]Then you guys will see that I spent like 30 grand on fucking Belgian waffles.
[16:05.43]It was a Belgian waffle company.
[16:07.87]Belgian waffle company.
[16:09.59]And it failed miserably.
[16:11.28]I lost it all.
[16:18.48]This is a stream, not an update video.
[16:20.82]Um... Well, I mean, we're kind of like just hanging out, seeing if Etalyx can play the game, so... We are just kind of hanging out.
[16:32.82]Senator hair.
[16:36.12]Dude, this is going to be some real senator hair eventually.
[16:38.82]Just you wait.
[16:47.11]That's tax deductible.
[16:52.38]Wait, Etalyx is, what do you mean?
[16:56.32]Are you good?
[16:58.35]uh well yeah I am I got the game to work oh you were I'm in the game uh I am currently waiting on your game to start I will be spectating your game okay and then as your game goes on I might have to restart my stream again for cpu problems I need to build a new computer this year yeah or just get a stream pc just I gotta do something man because it's just with like this with every game now
[17:25.41]I thought that the 980 Ti was pretty dang good when it came out, and now we're about to hit the 1080 Ti.
[17:30.73]I wonder if... I wonder if...
[17:39.77]You need to like... I think I need to reseat my CPU.
[17:43.77]I would get some thermal paste and just reseat it.
[17:45.89]The problem is I hate detaching the HDI, Corsair cooler, water cooler.
[17:52.42]Yeah.
[17:53.48]Because the first one that I ever tried to put on, I broke.
[17:57.14]Oh, you broke it.
[17:58.34]Yeah, it broke.
[17:59.06]And I had to return it and get a new one.
[18:00.90]So trying to remove it and put it back on, I'm afraid I'm going to break another one.
[18:05.81]Ha ha.
[18:06.67]You just don't want to smash it up and ruin everything.
[18:09.91]For whatever reason, the combo with my CPU required washers.
[18:16.16]There was too much space in between where you were supposed to screw in, so there was a gap.
[18:21.64]You know you cannot have a gap
[18:24.24]between the cooler and the CPU.
[18:26.10]Right.
[18:27.36]So I had to get third-party washers to close the gap.
[18:31.20]That's what scares me.
[18:32.60]Washers?
[18:33.78]Yeah, you know washers that you put in between like a screw and the thing that you're screwing in?
[18:37.81]Yeah.
[18:38.17]I had to get washers.
[18:39.47]What kind of material were they made out of?
[18:42.57]They're not conducive.
[18:44.17]Like, they don't conduct electricity.
[18:47.35]Alright, so you're like spectating my game right now?
[18:50.50]Yeah, why does it take so long?
[18:52.00]We've been on this menu for like 10 minutes now.
[18:54.12]Because this is Grand Theft Auto Online.
[18:56.96]This is going to be longer than the race.
[19:00.54]It probably will be.
[19:03.24]The race is 6 miles.
[19:04.92]If you're going 60 miles an hour, that's at most, what, like 6 minutes?
[19:10.46]Yeah, I wonder how long the race will be.
[19:13.19]Wait, six?
[19:14.09]How long is that?
[19:14.85]I don't know how to do math.
[19:16.77]Yeah.
[19:18.93]It's obvious that I'm uncomfortable talking about computers.
[19:21.43]What are you talking about?
[19:22.37]I know about computers.
[19:24.85]I've built computers.
[19:25.72]We both know a lot of them.
[19:27.08]I built computers.
[19:28.06]I built computers.
[19:29.66]I built computers.
[19:32.44]No, I don't.
[19:33.00]Yeah, but actually the 980 Ti is still fine.
[19:35.08]That's not what my problem is.
[19:36.28]It's the, uh, CPU.
[19:37.96]Alright, well, can 77 GTA Forever Weed, uh, please get in the game?
[19:44.55]He needs a new CPU.
[19:45.77]And he's self-smoking so much weed, and maybe, like, he'll... Oh, wait.
[19:49.43]Am I in the game?
[19:50.47]Are you?
[19:51.65]No.
[19:52.61]Can you pick your motorcycle?
[19:54.29]I'm just, like, waiting.
[19:55.41]Maybe I am in the game.
[19:57.85]I can't.
[19:58.13]All I can do is just sit here.
[19:59.81]I don't... It says you're in the game.
[20:02.74]No, I don't want to quit.
[20:03.60]Hold on.
[20:04.02]Yeah, stay in here.
[20:04.56]It says you're in here.
[20:05.06]Yeah, I know, but I think it's going to be like a slideshow if I actually do play.
[20:11.29]Well, we'll see.
[20:12.31]I was going to use this opportunity to conveniently configure my settings while you raced, and then the race never started.
[20:18.12]Yeah, I think this host is, for some reason, waiting for a full lobby in GTA Online.
[20:25.16]Once you get, like, 8, you go.
[20:27.62]Once you get 8 to 10, go.
[20:28.76]Because we'll be sitting here all night.
[20:38.01]No, don't quit this job.
[20:39.73]I want to see this.
[20:42.36]Kick him.
[20:43.60]Race time.
[20:45.28]People are getting antsy in the chat right now.
[20:47.62]People are getting edgy.
[20:48.64]People are getting antsy.
[20:54.15]How do you type?
[20:55.35]I don't know.
[20:57.09]W-Y-T-Y-U.
[21:00.21]Something like that.
[21:06.96]He's probably AFK and doesn't know he's host.
[21:13.41]It's SubwayZoom.
[21:15.97]Okay, no, team.
[21:17.49]What is it, T?
[21:21.97]Ah, yeah.
[21:29.46]R up.
[21:29.66]Come on, like, ready up.
[21:33.97]My name in this game is Booger Burps.
[21:36.29]I know, and I called it too.
[21:38.05]Like, when I got into the lobby, I was like, okay, if I was Jerma, I would be Booger Burps.
[21:42.81]Isn't that my name in, like, another game too?
[21:44.43]That would just be my name.
[21:45.67]77 GTA Forever Weed.
[22:07.43]Let's do this.
[22:08.13]My mother is screaming at me to do H-dub.
[22:14.17]Oh, God.
[22:14.65]77 GTA forever weed.
[22:18.68]You take your GTA forever.
[22:20.40]That means it's loading.
[22:21.32]Is it the loading screen forever?
[22:22.80]I could be watching anime right now.
[22:27.40]Your mama gonna get annoying fast.
[22:31.24]I think that was directed at you.
[22:32.44]Yeah, but, like, what is it?
[22:33.04]You're talking about, like, my mother's going to get annoying to me real quickly?
[22:37.36]Or is, like, he gonna get annoyed with my mother real fast?
[23:00.13]It's not even his fault.
[23:02.67]It's not even this guy's fault.
[23:09.43]I'm putting that guy on blast, and it's not even his fault.
[23:14.92]Everyone, we should just leave.
[23:16.30]Let's just get the fuck out of here.
[23:17.70]Give me a break.
[23:24.66]Okay.
[23:25.66]We're going, apparently.
[23:26.70]I guess we ran out of time.
[23:27.50]What?
[23:30.70]that I had already pushed the quit button did it rip me back into the race I don't know but apparently we're going alright this time I'm not gonna do a shitty like motorcycle we're doing a gray I'm doing a nice gray it's a good like this is a good loading simulator game
[23:53.35]It is GTA.
[23:54.61]After this, we might as well just drive, like, up on the top of the mountain and drive off.
[23:57.29]Remember when you said, like, 45 minutes?
[23:59.77]Yeah, it's been, like, 30.
[24:01.30]It's been, like, 30.
[24:02.06]So, like, after this, we're just going to go.
[24:04.26]Okay, no, I actually did quit, I think.
[24:05.86]We're going to the top of Mount Chiliad, and we're just driving off, and then the stream's turning off.
[24:10.28]I think I am not in your game.
[24:13.48]I don't think you are.
[24:16.86]Apparently I quit right as he decided to do it.
[24:20.11]Maybe try walking around.
[24:22.31]See if you can get a feel for if you're able to do it.
[24:31.42]I'm going to mute.
[24:35.34]I will too.
[24:40.19]What's the guy in the suit doing?
[24:41.30]I don't know.
[24:41.74]This one looks kind of, kind of fun.
[24:46.86]Although, I gotta like, my eyes have to stop like watering up.
[24:50.70]That would be great.
[24:53.10]Why is, why are they ghosts?
[24:56.67]Is there a reason?
[24:57.67]So there's no collision?
[24:58.47]Did somebody, did he turn off collision?
[25:01.15]Wow.
[25:01.37]I don't even want to play this.
[25:06.09]What kind of absolute madman turns off collision in a Grand Theft Auto game?
[25:13.73]You're out of your mind.
[25:15.37]You've lost your damn mind.
[25:17.07]If you want to turn collision off.
[25:23.42]That's like half the fun.
[25:25.96]Half the fun is smashing into people.
[25:36.74]How do I fucking... I just wanna go play with Etalyx.
[25:53.08]This host... This host took like 10 minutes to get this started and it's doing ghost racing?
[26:07.70]How do I get- I just want to get out of here.
[26:10.98]I'm just going to like a new lobby.
[26:15.61]I landed that.
[26:21.27]How the fuck did I land that?
[26:23.65]Hey, somebody just said I was thirsty.
[26:30.62]You were right, I was thirsty.
[26:32.24]You were correct.
[26:35.58]I don't know how I landed that.
[26:37.38]But we're still just waiting for Etalyx.
[26:40.12]Wherever he may be.
[26:41.26]He's getting this ready.
[26:44.56]No collision.
[26:45.32]Well, I mean, no collision is not bad, but... Like, what's the... I mean, come on.
[26:50.99]Oh, wait.
[26:51.37]Etalyx has gone offline.
[26:52.45]Uh-oh.
[26:54.87]Uh-oh.
[26:57.49]Hydrate time?
[26:58.70]That's not vodka.
[26:59.46]That's just water.
[27:01.56]Uh...
[27:04.08]At least I can get, like, a good look at all this shit.
[27:08.80]Find a new session.
[27:09.64]Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.
[27:10.82]Alright, I'm gonna... What am I gonna do?
[27:13.36]I'm gonna disappear for a minute.
[27:15.78]I'm gonna disappear for a minute while we wait for Etalyx.
[27:20.50]Press A and then X to quit.
[27:21.96]I don't have... I'm using a fucking keyboard.
[27:24.22]Wait a minute, here we go.
[27:31.85]Job list?
[27:37.03]God.
[27:38.65]God, God, God, God.
[27:39.95]I'm just going to play a quick job.
[27:41.15]Not available.
[27:42.63]What the hell do I even do here?
[27:53.63]The camera cut.
[27:54.38]I might be dead.
[27:55.54]What?
[27:58.12]No, I did that so I could pick my nose and you guys couldn't even see.
[28:04.34]I'm doing that because, like, I'm literally picking my nose right now.
[28:06.54]And, like, no, I'm not.
[28:07.46]Didn't happen on stream.
[28:09.84]You know?
[28:10.18]You're gonna try to, like, call me out for that?
[28:13.16]Oh, we saw you do that!
[28:14.02]No, it's not happening on screen right now.
[28:35.32]Alright, well, I'm just gonna, like, just escape.
[28:41.24]Just get me out of here.
[28:48.59]Please don't turn around.
[28:49.75]Why?
[28:52.21]Oh, because Kim came in with the dog.
[28:55.69]Showing Otto.
[29:00.69]We can see you still.
[29:01.89]No, you can't.
[29:03.23]No, you can't.
[29:04.27]You can't see me.
[29:10.46]It took way longer than it should have.
[29:11.74]Well, I'm also just sitting here.
[29:13.46]Look, I'm in no rush to play this game right now.
[29:17.14]You know?
[29:18.10]I'm kind of just chilling.
[29:22.94]I'm kind of... We're in limbo right now.
[29:24.66]There's an arrow.
[29:36.24]Oh, no.
[29:36.66]Now I'm getting the thing that was happening to Etalyx.
[29:42.05]And who is blowing up my phone?
[29:48.05]Somebody's texting the... F-U-C-K out of me.
[29:53.21]How's my day been?
[29:53.85]My day has been wearing, like, single player right now.
[30:01.42]He's eating them.
[30:05.52]Anyone who fully pronounces the ing and chilling isn't actually chillin'.
[30:10.17]Well, yeah, they are.
[30:11.49]I just told you I was.
[30:13.05]I'm chilling.
[30:15.03]I'm chilling.
[30:15.71]Well, that was fun!
[30:21.75]Is Etalyx back online yet?
[30:24.11]Or is he just chilling?
[30:24.73]Let's see.
[30:25.19]Is he just chilling?
[30:27.21]How you doing?
[30:28.15]How's life treating you?
[30:29.73]How are the kids?
[30:32.09]Kicking me while I'm down.
[30:33.63]Really?
[30:34.31]What is the third person button for PC controls?
[30:38.16]V?
[30:39.18]Third person or first person?
[30:41.10]The one that alternates between the two.
[30:42.76]It's V. Yeah, V.
[30:46.83]Yeah, I still have 99%.
[30:47.99]Dude, Steam was doing that to me before.
[30:53.73]Not like a Steam thing, but I've been stuck at 99% a couple times this week for some reason.
[30:59.70]No, this is 99% CPU load.
[31:04.04]As in, my computer is melting currently.
[31:07.24]Sorry, lady.
[31:11.32]99% CPU.
[31:14.37]Can't stream things at 60 frames per second.
[31:21.00]I forgot how fun this was.
[31:29.16]Everyone's asking about your new thermal paste.
[31:32.00]Oh, my new thermal paste?
[31:34.73]I've got some in a little tube here.
[31:36.87]Arctic.
[31:37.79]What is it called?
[31:38.37]Arctic thermal compound?
[31:40.87]Hang on.
[31:41.69]Hold on.
[31:41.85]Let me go get it.
[31:51.74]No, I didn't... What?
[31:52.80]I didn't want to do that.
[31:57.30]I wanted to, like, hold it.
[31:58.66]No, stop shooting.
[31:59.80]I want to, like, punch.
[32:01.78]Oh, great.
[32:04.70]I'm running.
[32:06.18]Okay.
[32:06.88]So, what we have here is a genuine tube of Arctic Silver V. That is some high-density polysynthetic silver thermal compound.
[32:16.45]Ooh, and it's still got the cap right on top.
[32:19.29]How do I switch weapons?
[32:20.63]Haven't even used it before.
[32:21.79]Getting ready to freshly squeeze it for the first time.
[32:24.51]Really?
[32:24.77]Oh, look at that, baby.
[32:27.37]So how is your stream?
[32:28.39]Are you streamed out?
[32:30.66]Are you going to have to end the stream?
[32:35.40]How are things?
[32:36.24]If we're still playing, I can restart the stream and just turn my frames down.
[32:42.38]I'm just like running on the sidewalk, just like run, run, run, run, run.
[32:46.33]Behind people.
[32:50.09]Everyone's just doing like cray-gasms.
[32:52.79]Oh, arctic.
[32:59.32]Is it cray-gasm?
[33:00.68]How do you pronounce it?
[33:02.52]No way!
[33:13.91]Scroll on the weapon.
[33:20.47]Breath of the Wild really looks like a new turn for the Zelda franchise.
[33:22.99]Are they with this many police officers here?
[33:28.36]Damn.
[33:31.42]Alright, well, what's the verdict here, Etalyx?
[33:34.60]People say it looks fine, but it bumps and it'll hiccup.
[33:39.14]That's pretty much it.
[33:40.71]I've turned down most of my settings as far as I can.
[33:44.55]Apparently I've just got a little peasant computer.
[33:47.07]Let's just go rob a store.
[33:48.97]You and I. You and I?
[33:52.39]You and I are going to go rob a store.
[33:58.10]I don't have to go online or something.
[34:01.06]Maybe if I limited my frames.
[34:04.51]Good idea.
[34:08.32]Just go.
[34:09.78]Go.
[34:10.28]Hey, welcome to another loading screen.
[34:11.58]Yeah, I didn't pre-order a Switch or anything.
[34:16.30]I was going to potentially go get one if any stores had one.
[34:22.46]Actually getting arrested in GTA.
[34:23.84]No, really.
[34:29.00]That means I just didn't feel like pressing any buttons at the moment.
[34:32.15]Okay, how do we get in a group or whatever?
[34:33.55]I don't know how to play this game anymore.
[34:36.62]So if you just go to join, like you can join friends and you should be able to join my session once I get in.
[34:42.32]But I'm also using a keyboard, so I don't know.
[34:46.24]Escape, go to online, go to join friends and then find booger burps.
[34:54.92]Do you have a session?
[34:56.34]I'm currently in a session right now.
[34:59.98]There we go.
[35:02.06]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[35:03.72]You'll be in my apartment, probably.
[35:05.48]If you join off me.
[35:07.00]We can have some wine.
[35:09.37]Thank you, KX, for the thousand bits.
[35:11.09]They say swift rage.
[35:12.41]Thank you.
[35:13.49]For the ten bucks and your beautiful animated emote.
[35:15.87]It looks wonderful.
[35:17.99]That guy tagged!
[35:19.31]That guy tagged two!
[35:21.11]That guy tagged two!
[35:23.49]Have I ever played Darkest Dungeon?
[35:25.79]I have not played Darkest Dungeon.
[35:28.72]I feel like that game would make me turn my hair out of my head.
[35:33.17]It's a very difficult game, right?
[35:36.09]But no, I have not played it.
[35:37.01]But thank you for the $5.
[35:37.99]Appreciate it.
[35:38.49]That guy tagged too.
[35:41.23]Solid Pat, thanks for the $5.
[35:42.49]You're about to get sneak killed by Kim.
[35:44.77]I saw her in the Viewfinder.
[35:46.94]I didn't want to turn around and startle her or something and have Otto be like, yeah, and bite me.
[35:51.90]Otto would never bite me, but you know.
[35:55.20]But thank you, Solid Pat, for the $5.
[35:56.48]Appreciate it.
[36:00.71]Also, MooMeansMoo said, for $5, thanks.
[36:03.53]Don't fret about keeping up with donations.
[36:04.89]Your streams are some of the best out there.
[36:06.25]Playing Catch-Up with the Bits when you get a chance is fine.
[36:08.73]Would I ever play Spider-Man 2 on stream?
[36:12.00]Um, yeah.
[36:14.22]Maybe.
[36:15.22]Spider-Man's like a joke, you know?
[36:18.52]Spider-Man to me is just like a little bit of a joke.
[36:20.63]It's not necessarily something I actually want to play, but maybe.
[36:23.87]We'll see.
[36:24.81]But thank you.
[36:31.83]Alright.
[36:32.43]Are you, uh, why are you not in my apartment?
[36:34.03]I don't see you.
[36:34.45]Do I have to, like, buzz you in?
[36:40.59]I'm breaking everything.
[36:42.33]Wait, what did you do?
[36:43.11]Uh, I tried limiting my frames to 10, just to see if that would improve my CPU, and it does.
[36:48.95]Turns out it does.
[36:50.39]A joke, how dare you.
[36:51.77]When you were watching visual slides.
[36:53.45]No, have you seen my, like, Spider-Man, like, update video jokes where I just keep playing them for no reason?
[36:58.14]Okay, I think I got it.
[36:59.10]I'm ready.
[36:59.62]I love those games, don't worry.
[37:01.53]Alright.
[37:02.35]How do I find you?
[37:03.23]You're in my session, right?
[37:07.34]Yeah, I'm in an apartment.
[37:08.68]It could be yours.
[37:09.24]It could be mine.
[37:09.76]Well, that's you over there.
[37:10.62]I'm going to see you in a second.
[37:12.60]Okay, I'm going to the street.
[37:13.94]Yep, go to the street.
[37:15.40]It's alright.
[37:15.80]You'll see me soon.
[37:21.56]If you head down that street, you should be able to find me.
[37:27.62]Yeah, if you bang a right, you'll see me.
[37:33.35]Is that my truck?
[37:34.83]I guess this is my truck.
[37:36.65]Did I buy this?
[37:39.05]It's not you.
[37:39.64]Where the fuck are you?
[37:43.72]I don't even know how to get in.
[37:44.78]There we go.
[37:49.32]I guess this is my car.
[37:50.46]I just don't know any of the controls.
[37:51.74]Is this the Swansea flag on the back of my car?
[37:56.36]This guy's driving around the whole time.
[37:58.76]He's like Ford Model T.
[38:04.08]You say, I'm gonna come get you with this Model T!
[38:05.66]Alright, I don't know how to do anything in this game.
[38:11.92]Alright, we need to find each other first.
[38:14.34]I can't even open up the map.
[38:16.82]This is not him.
[38:17.82]It's, uh, escape.
[38:20.22]Why is everything escape in this game?
[38:21.72]I don't know, I just wish I had a controller plugged in.
[38:24.26]It's like relearning how to play the game.
[38:27.00]Uh, you're in my session though, right?
[38:29.10]Yeah.
[38:29.68]I think I see somebody on the map.
[38:31.60]Alex, there you are.
[38:40.35]Aiming is way better.
[38:42.21]True.
[38:46.13]Have I seen Hollow Knight?
[38:49.36]What do you know about Hollow Knight?
[38:50.14]Oh, that's the, uh... I know it's like a side-scrolling, really, like, tough-as-nails Dark Souls Metroidvania.
[38:58.48]Really?
[38:59.52]Yep.
[39:02.62]That's what I heard about it.
[39:03.68]I haven't played it myself.
[39:05.14]Um...
[39:06.97]That's all I know.
[39:08.62]It's, like, really difficult, and it's got a cool art style.
[39:13.92]It's a lot of timing stuff.
[39:16.42]I beat Dark Souls 3 on stream, though, so, like, would I be able to handle it?
[39:19.10]I mean, I knew that.
[39:21.26]And, of course, anyone who beats Dark Souls 3 on stream is more than qualified for something as, you know, easy as Hollow Knight.
[39:29.95]It doesn't even stand up in comparison, really.
[39:33.34]I mean, I know.
[39:34.48]I mean, I know this.
[39:35.36]Just making sure you know this.
[39:36.26]Alright, you're very far away from me.
[39:39.46]You're, like, all the way up there.
[39:40.33]I need to put, like, a marker on you or something.
[39:45.43]A waypoint.
[39:46.11]A waypoint is enter?
[39:48.29]Oh, you're not that far away.
[39:49.15]Okay.
[39:49.35]Alright, come grab me.
[39:52.11]You turn on, like, that straight down there.
[39:55.02]You'll see me.
[39:58.56]Is that you in the shitbox or what?
[40:01.14]This is me.
[40:03.58]Oh, okay.
[40:04.64]That's you.
[40:05.52]Yeah, that is you.
[40:07.38]That's you.
[40:08.98]Yeah.
[40:09.64]There's somebody coming to kill you, I think.
[40:11.00]Or they're coming to kill me.
[40:12.10]Yeah, there's somebody coming to kill me.
[40:15.86]That makes perfect sense to me.
[40:17.00]Do they kill you?
[40:19.50]No.
[40:20.10]Oh, well, they're going to, so get in.
[40:22.18]You are a bad Star Trek hologram.
[40:26.59]What?
[40:27.33]Just stay there.
[40:28.71]Get in, you said?
[40:29.45]There's like three people here.
[40:30.97]Okay, three people.
[40:32.75]Yep.
[40:34.92]This guy in the old tiny car.
[40:36.26]You know, there are three people there.
[40:37.94]There are three people.
[40:38.68]I mean, if I really wanted to count, I could see one, two, three.
[40:42.47]If I actually wanted to count.
[40:43.55]He's gonna maybe headshot me?
[40:45.75]I don't know.
[40:46.65]I'm very confused right now by the... Do you have like a fan base or something?
[40:52.13]Are these like your fans?
[40:53.55]Etalyx, I think you are confusing everybody.
[40:55.45]I'm pretty sure that's the case.
[40:57.37]Really?
[40:57.85]Wait, what?
[40:58.91]Just turn on my stream for a second.
[41:00.85]Okay, hold on.
[41:02.89]Are they gonna blow me up?
[41:04.43]I don't think they can.
[41:06.11]You don't exist.
[41:06.87]Nobody can hurt you.
[41:07.65]I'm watching your stream now.
[41:09.29]You're a bad 1920s animation.
[41:10.75]Oh.
[41:10.83]Hang on.
[41:13.25]Alright, well, let's go.
[41:14.83]Hang on, I'm gonna start.
[41:17.06]Can you get in my car?
[41:18.58]Just walk up to one of the sides of me and hold F.
[41:21.73]Um... This... No.
[41:24.87]Other side.
[41:25.39]You're almost there.
[41:25.97]Okay, I'm gonna direct you.
[41:26.75]I'm gonna guide you.
[41:27.29]I can't just, like, punch you in the face.
[41:31.87]That dude just... Hold on.
[41:37.97]Are you alive?
[41:38.45]Dude, I'm dead.
[41:39.11]This guy just fucking destroyed me.
[41:42.18]He's trying to... I have no idea what... Okay, I see what's happening, but I don't understand what's happening.
[41:51.32]Right.
[41:52.66]Well, it makes you feel better.
[41:53.80]People are lagging all over my screen, too.
[41:55.53]It makes you feel better, I don't understand.
[41:57.69]Really, cop?
[41:58.61]Honest to God?
[42:00.43]I'm walking here.
[42:02.73]Alright, so, uh, hold on.
[42:06.76]People are just gonna think you're hacking.
[42:08.78]Fuck, I didn't even mean to do that.
[42:12.44]That lady was just jogging.
[42:17.11]I just fucked up for shit.
[42:18.93]Alright, come to me.
[42:20.53]We need to figure this out.
[42:22.35]Maybe this guy will help me.
[42:24.90]Okay, why are the police chasing me now?
[42:28.78]I didn't do anything bad.
[42:29.74]Alright, take us to Etalyx.
[42:30.54]I don't know where to find you.
[42:32.34]I think this guy's going to be my little chauffeur for a minute here.
[42:37.16]There you are.
[42:39.96]Are you in the same spot you were before?
[42:41.88]No, I'm kind of driving up towards the home.
[42:45.14]I'm going towards my home icon.
[42:48.51]Yeah, we're going to follow you.
[42:49.85]I want you to go into your apartment.
[42:51.67]Stop moving for a second.
[42:54.79]Okay.
[42:55.53]But the cops are chasing me.
[42:56.73]Turn around.
[42:57.03]I want you to come get me.
[42:59.39]Come get you.
[43:00.05]I want you to come just fight and try to attack people.
[43:03.71]Are you over there by the blob of people?
[43:06.19]Yeah, I'm currently getting lit the fuck up.
[43:09.17]By this guy.
[43:10.16]Are you dead?
[43:11.38]I forgot.
[43:11.68]We're playing GTA Online, which means everybody dies no matter what.
[43:15.68]I forgot.
[43:16.97]Except for me, because I'm hacking.
[43:18.70]So, can't get me.
[43:20.02]This is Grand Theft Auto Online, a.k.a.
[43:22.64]if I see an online player, I'm going to unload the clip into them no matter what.
[43:27.44]Is there an easier way to track friends?
[43:31.14]I'm not sure.
[43:34.52]Okay, I'm coming to you.
[43:35.34]So you just stay where you are, and I'll be there in a second.
[43:38.58]How about that?
[43:39.32]Is that you?
[43:40.80]I'm coming.
[43:41.46]Oh, that's you.
[43:41.90]Okay.
[43:44.78]There you are.
[43:45.36]Okay.
[43:48.45]From where you are, walk forward and hold F now.
[43:51.27]I am.
[43:54.05]What happens if you get out of that car?
[43:59.48]Okay, that could... Get back in the car.
[44:06.70]Oh, dear.
[44:10.36]Hang on.
[44:10.56]I'm going to go back over here where it's safe.
[44:13.73]What if... Hold on.
[44:15.61]What if you...
[44:19.93]Okay, I need to get in the car.
[44:21.45]You need to move because I'm going to run over you if you don't move.
[44:24.19]You're not going to run me over.
[44:26.75]You are not going to run me over.
[44:28.95]Try to.
[44:29.27]Okay.
[44:30.63]Just crush me.
[44:34.15]We're good.
[44:35.97]I'm running over you in a monster truck, by the way.
[44:39.45]In a monster truck.
[44:41.63]So let's stop a random car and see what happens if I can see it and we can get in.
[44:49.00]I have no idea what's going on.
[44:50.26]I don't... I'm between dimensions right now.
[44:51.86]How do I hang this guy up?
[44:52.82]Alright.
[44:54.78]The guy in the candy cane costume is kind of freaking me out a little.
[44:57.89]Yeah.
[44:58.95]So, you see this car right here, right?
[45:00.75]I have to stop the way we're at.
[45:02.19]I'm pulling him out.
[45:02.97]Okay.
[45:05.07]Yeah.
[45:05.47]Get in this car.
[45:06.21]You want me to get in?
[45:07.35]Mm-hmm.
[45:09.47]You get in this car and get in the driver's seat.
[45:14.44]Alright.
[45:15.82]I don't know what magic your monster car... Can you see the monster car on your screen?
[45:20.72]Yeah, somebody's pushing it right now.
[45:24.06]Somebody, like, ran into it.
[45:26.65]So, can you see me normally?
[45:28.07]Yeah.
[45:29.05]Okay, so we fixed the problem.
[45:30.71]It's just my monster truck is completely bugged.
[45:36.11]Okay, so just stay in the monster truck.
[45:40.88]Yeah, get back in the monster truck.
[45:42.72]Okay.
[45:43.30]I want to just drive with you.
[45:44.75]So get in the monster truck, and I want you to drive, like, right, like, on top of me.
[45:52.09]Okay.
[45:54.29]Let me get a running start real quick.
[45:56.19]Okay.
[45:59.07]Nothing about that is correct.
[46:00.80]What was that?
[46:02.00]Someone's dropping bombs on us.
[46:03.16]Alright, so just, like, stay with me.
[46:07.71]Yeah, I don't think I can affect anything in the game world with this truck, actually.
[46:11.11]And my CPU's locked out at 100%, apparently, so... Maybe that's... Now you're just hovering.
[46:21.54]What if I get, like, banned for hacking?
[46:23.70]No, it's not gonna happen.
[46:25.06]You're pushing me around.
[46:26.60]I'm pushing you.
[46:27.54]You just went underneath me.
[46:32.78]Alright, follow me.
[46:34.74]So I can't push you.
[46:35.60]I cannot affect you.
[46:36.44]You lead the way.
[46:37.26]I'm just gonna follow you.
[46:38.22]I'm gonna follow the raindrop person.
[46:43.36]So you lead the way.
[46:44.35]Lead the way, guy that is currently raining.
[46:47.57]That's the only way.
[46:52.37]I'm stuck.
[46:53.81]You're stuck?
[46:54.75]Okay, there.
[46:55.43]I'm free.
[46:56.13]Alright, go.
[46:57.11]I don't know where to go.
[46:59.28]Okay.
[47:00.61]Whoa, that's a little too fast.
[47:03.43]That's too fast.
[47:04.27]Slowing down?
[47:04.89]Okay, now go really fast on the strip.
[47:08.25]Fast.
[47:10.68]Just keep going straight.
[47:14.46]My poor computer.
[47:16.74]I'm playing like an 8-bit Nintendo game.
[47:19.68]Yeah, that's what this is.
[47:23.12]This is an 8-bit Nintendo game.
[47:24.62]This is lagging my whole computer.
[47:30.42]It's so choppy.
[47:33.55]I'm only still streaming at this point, so everyone has documented proof that I'm not like... A hacker.
[47:39.65]A hacker.
[47:40.51]Like glitching the game.
[47:43.15]Oh, well, I can't even see you now.
[47:46.99]Alright, let's do our go to mount chili.
[47:48.70]I didn't jump off, but you have to be in that car Oh, yeah, that is the classic isn't it okay?
[47:53.50]How do you get there so follow me?
[47:56.48]I?
[47:56.58]believe I'm out mount chili odd I Remember vaguely where it is me too.
[48:02.22]I think it's like it's either this one or like this one Which one is it somewhere up in this area is it all the way up there?
[48:12.21]I thought it was like closer to here oh
[48:16.86]I'll know it when I see it.
[48:17.98]I'm just going to drive up here.
[48:21.32]You are a hacker, though.
[48:23.19]No, I'm not.
[48:26.47]This is why you don't delete.
[48:27.75]I did have to do something weird to make the game work, by the way.
[48:31.01]Yeah, you did.
[48:32.31]I had to delete the social club file and let it regenerate.
[48:36.14]What just happened?
[48:37.14]What?
[48:39.46]What did you do?
[48:39.88]There's a UFO here.
[48:41.16]There's an actual hacker here now.
[48:43.76]Oh, no.
[48:45.36]We found an actual hacker.
[48:46.76]Oh, no.
[48:48.56]Yeah, a UFO just hit me.
[48:52.89]Are you in the car with three people?
[48:55.25]I don't know.
[48:55.89]This guy's the Joker.
[48:56.97]I'm in the car with the Joker.
[49:00.45]What?
[49:02.03]Wait, hold on a second.
[49:03.27]Oh, there's another UFO.
[49:04.52]This is not supposed to be happening.
[49:07.10]No.
[49:07.70]Okay.
[49:08.02]This is not the normal GTA experience.
[49:11.78]Okay.
[49:12.92]Okay.
[49:14.42]Hang on, I need to get in the car with you.
[49:15.66]Well, well, yeah, I mean... No, I don't.
[49:19.78]The cars are, like, vibrating now.
[49:22.27]This just got real strange.
[49:25.47]Abort.
[49:26.27]I can't tell if this is, like, an in-game thing.
[49:29.21]They probably think it's meat.
[49:30.56]Aliens are invading.
[49:32.00]They definitely think it's meat.
[49:33.80]That's the hacker.
[49:36.08]They all are so convinced, I'm sure.
[49:38.62]They're convinced.
[49:40.18]Okay, let me tell you something.
[49:41.50]If I... If I saw what you're seeing... Dude, somebody's just braking.
[49:46.95]I have no control of the car.
[49:49.87]I have no control of the car or the camera.
[49:52.97]I'm not doing this.
[49:55.03]I'm not driving this fucking car.
[49:57.06]There's three people in the car with you.
[49:59.26]Yeah.
[50:02.77]I don't know what to even do now.
[50:04.23]I don't know what to do.
[50:06.17]This is definitely you doing this.
[50:08.51]Yeah.
[50:09.29]There's a helicopter coming down here now.
[50:12.69]I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[50:15.05]Player... Wait, that's me!
[50:17.31]I just got out of the car.
[50:18.27]I just witnessed myself get out of the car.
[50:21.81]I just had an auto body experience.
[50:25.77]Why is everybody shaking?
[50:29.32]Oh no, God, what?
[50:31.04]I don't know.
[50:31.80]That is the Joker.
[50:33.86]It actually is the Joker.
[50:37.90]Where are you?
[50:38.42]Are you dead now?
[50:39.57]No, I've been hacked into oblivion.
[50:42.75]Okay, so you're gone.
[50:44.37]I've been hacked up.
[50:45.35]They haven't chosen me yet.
[50:46.73]Yeah.
[50:48.89]But the Joker's casually walking down the street now.
[50:51.59]Oh, is he?
[50:52.15]You know, here's the funny thing.
[50:53.39]I can't even aim.
[50:54.01]I can't aim the gun.
[50:54.90]And I can't fire.
[50:57.54]Now I can.
[51:02.36]Everybody just turned into jelly beans.
[51:06.20]The Joker is no longer a player.
[51:09.04]The Joker is an NPC now.
[51:12.48]He's an NPC now.
[51:14.30]Where am I supposed to go?
[51:15.94]I got my computer hacked into oblivion.
[51:21.47]Can I actually get... Okay, I'm getting into a car, apparently.
[51:27.81]The Joker is scared in the car.
[51:39.12]He's gone.
[51:40.20]He's gone.
[51:49.24]What did I do?
[51:50.16]I didn't do anything.
[51:53.30]The camera controls are so fucked up.
[51:57.12]Look at this camera, dude.
[51:58.78]Hold on.
[51:59.22]Hold on.
[51:59.62]Find me.
[52:00.74]Can you find me?
[52:01.56]I'm not even in the right game.
[52:06.20]It's this fucking UFO that this dude put in here.
[52:11.92]Now my guy's just like throwing up into the passenger seat.
[52:15.06]I just keep puking into the passenger seat.
[52:24.35]And he's like, I've been hacked!
[52:26.35]I've been fucking hacked!
[52:30.24]I have no idea what's going on anymore.
[52:34.80]Oh my god.
[52:38.03]Okay.
[52:40.11]Do I have a stinger?
[52:41.07]I guess I have a stinger.
[52:41.99]Okay.
[52:44.25]No, uh, by the way, no, I am not controlling this.
[52:51.54]Turn off the cheat engine.
[52:53.24]Is somebody still in this game?
[52:58.52]I'm gonna find you.
[52:59.78]I'm back in the game.
[53:01.78]Oh, so can I get to you?
[53:04.22]Or you get to a bull?
[53:05.15]The Joker's back.
[53:12.53]I don't see you.
[53:13.03]Are you in my game?
[53:14.11]Did they throw you in a different lobby?
[53:16.74]They put you in a different lobby.
[53:20.24]You're not in my lobby anymore.
[53:29.42]I'm in a horror movie right now, Etalyx.
[53:32.17]I'm in a legit horror movie.
[53:33.39]This guy, the Joker, is coming after me.
[53:38.90]I think I must be in a new lobby.
[53:42.74]So he forcefully pushed you into a different game.
[53:45.50]I don't know.
[53:47.98]Okay.
[53:48.22]I mean, can you join this one?
[53:50.90]Uh, I'm attempting to right now.

[53:58.38]You're gonna leave a helicopter here.
[53:59.88]Bad move.
[54:00.62]Because it's mine now.
[54:03.66]Oh, God, he's back.
[54:15.28]This is gonna be funny.
[54:18.28]Let me tell you something, ladies and gentlemen.
[54:22.77]I can't even do Joker right now.

[56:22.85]Somebody just got in.
[56:23.75]A fucking pedestrian just got in their car.

[57:29.57]I've been kidnapped from the job will be not That's car you're being loaded around by a group of hackers though There's three people near you dude.
[57:40.05]Maybe the Joker is the one that's like actually trying to save me oh
[57:44.43]He's the ringleader.
[57:45.41]No, no, I don't think so.
[57:47.85]I don't know.
[57:49.45]From what I just watched on the screen, I'm not sure if that's possible.
[57:53.54]Okay, this is weird.
[57:57.04]I was driving around behind you, and my monster truck was here.
[58:00.26]Really?
[58:01.28]Yeah, it's just like here.
[58:03.97]It was meant for me.
[58:08.11]Freaking me out right now.
[58:10.99]They're like driving you away.
[58:12.65]I can't catch up to you.
[58:13.73]Am I being taken away by the hacker, or are the hackers coming after me?
[58:18.13]I just don't know.
[58:18.75]I've not read this issue of Batman yet.
[58:21.31]I don't know.
[58:22.52]I don't know how this one plays out.
[58:26.80]I'm pretty sure this is my monster truck.
[58:29.80]Did you ever, like, buy it?
[58:31.40]I think I did, because I remember I put the Swansea flag on there back when we were playing with Boo.
[58:35.81]Oh.
[58:36.57]Yeah, probably.
[58:39.40]But it was still just in the middle of the road for some reason.
[58:44.82]Oh, wow.
[58:45.44]Alright.
[58:47.80]Nice work.
[58:49.67]Nice work, Joker.
[58:51.23]Can I not jump out?
[58:53.53]I've been able to get out this whole time.
[58:54.67]And I'm dead.
[58:57.61]Well.
[59:01.19]About that.
[59:01.61]I thought I was held hostage.
[59:05.48]I was just sucked into the car.
[59:09.01]Could you not just hold F to get out?
[59:11.39]Well, I guess I didn't even think to do that.
[59:15.61]Seriously?
[59:16.51]I just, like, I got sucked into the car, and I'm just like, alright, I'm not going to, I'm just going to see what happens.
[59:20.40]Embellishment for the narrative.
[59:23.44]I just, I honestly just didn't even press it.
[59:30.65]Joker was the good guy all along, I guess.
[59:33.73]I think I'm right behind you.
[59:36.07]Yeah, you are.
[59:37.94]Am I still hacker boy?
[59:39.34]Or... Okay.
[59:40.30]Yeah, you definitely are.
[59:42.58]So this guy's not really sure what's going on.
[59:44.54]I think he just shot at me.
[59:46.56]Oh, that was me.
[59:47.93]Oh.
[59:48.91]Okay, you know that game, that VR game, like, Who's the Werewolf?
[59:54.19]I don't, actually.
[59:55.13]Or like Mafia.
[59:55.69]You know like Mafia, how you have to figure out who the guy that's killing people is, or who the werewolf is that's killing the townspeople?
[60:00.85]Yeah.
[60:01.05]That's what we're doing right now.
[60:03.24]Because right now, you're one of those people that's the bluffer.
[60:05.90]That everyone thinks it's you.
[60:06.80]I'm the bluffer, yeah.
[60:07.54]Right?
[60:08.28]Like, I'm just the townsperson.
[60:10.22]Who knows who the real werewolf is?
[60:11.74]Who knows who the hacker is?
[60:13.38]It could be you.
[60:13.92]Who's the real werewolf?
[60:15.18]It might be you.
[60:16.14]Who knows?
[60:16.76]Who's the werewolf?
[60:20.63]That was amazing.
[60:21.59]I cannot keep up with you.
[60:22.57]Their cars are faster than mine.
[60:24.99]My hacker car is not good enough.
[60:27.69]Also, I don't know where the... It's gotta be Cat Lover.
[60:30.51]You're always in the car with Cat Lover.
[60:33.38]I was with the barf man.
[60:35.06]Jarf buff.
[60:36.66]So now you're with Catluffer?
[60:41.46]Should have finished the Arkham VR.
[60:42.94]Alright, I'm here with like two other players and we're all driving behind you for some reason.
[60:49.79]I don't even know what's happening.
[60:52.35]I've kind of just accepted the fact that this is happening and we're just doing it.
[61:05.66]Monster truck kind of sucks over bridges actually.
[61:08.22]Does it?
[61:09.24]Take a shortcut.
[61:10.16]The Joker's trying to save you.
[61:12.93]I don't know who's a good guy or who's a bad guy.
[61:14.93]I don't know who the werewolf is.
[61:16.17]It could be anyone.
[61:22.99]Did this tunnel exist?
[61:25.47]What are these people doing in here?
[61:30.87]Guys, that's not a good place for you to hang out with your gang.
[61:34.67]It's inside of a highway tunnel.
[61:38.88]There's no reason to be in there.
[61:46.97]What a terrible place to bring your gang.
[61:53.56]Hey guys, let's have our weekly gang meeting.
[61:57.36]Let's have our weekly gang meeting in front of Ted Williams' tunnel.
[62:01.14]Like, what are you, fucking crazy?
[62:11.37]We are just going all the way up, huh?
[62:14.07]How far away are you now?
[62:16.99]Um... Funny you should ask.
[62:19.77]Oh, what happened to you?
[62:24.20]Might have fallen into the river.
[62:29.22]Maybe.
[62:29.70]I don't know what these guys are going to do to me when I'm on the top of the mountain.
[62:34.28]I feel like someone's going to drop a UFO on me.
[62:35.66]Is that what they're doing?
[62:36.42]They're taking you up there?
[62:37.79]I'm up here.
[62:38.25]I'm going up here.
[62:45.75]Is it Pegasus that brings you the car?
[62:47.29]Yes.
[62:52.21]I can only select a rental shuttle bus to be delivered.
[62:55.35]What?
[62:56.61]Get the rental shuttle bus.
[62:57.85]You have to.
[62:59.19]Okay.
[63:02.09]I guess I got to run to it.
[63:07.70]I don't know who to trust.
[63:13.00]We get up here and Bigfoot's up here.
[63:18.60]It's so funny, I'm looking at chat and half of chat is telling me who the bad guy is and the other half of chat is saying who the bad guy is.
[63:26.90]You guys are being very conflicting of who the bad guy is here.
[63:29.16]I don't know who it is.
[63:34.77]Yeah, so it turns out it's not being delivered.
[63:37.47]I have to run to it.
[63:38.87]Really?
[63:40.21]Can you tell one of your hacker friends to spawn a helicopter for me?
[63:42.73]That'd be nice.
[63:44.97]No, but then that makes us accomplices and we don't want to be connected.
[63:50.42]This whole stream is a Buffy Madlib.
[63:55.68]Dude, holy back, that was fucking hilarious.
[64:11.09]Because it really is.
[64:13.33]It's like, noun, the Joker.
[64:15.05]No, don't!
[64:19.73]Thing!
[64:19.99]UFO!
[64:20.53]Alright, now I would've... Alright.
[64:30.22]You guys ready?
[64:31.02]You guys ready for, like, who's the werewolf?
[64:33.90]I'm gonna make that decision right now.
[64:35.52]So, I'm the talents person.
[64:36.42]I have to make that decision.
[64:38.00]So, from what I've seen so far, you're very suspicious.
[64:41.34]You're extremely suspicious.
[64:44.51]You, not so much.
[64:45.65]But, I don't even know if he was here before.
[64:47.75]You know what I mean?
[65:01.44]It was the girl!
[65:06.69]It was the girl, apparently.
[65:07.93]Yeah, well, we'll fucking find out.
[65:16.15]Hey, Joker.
[65:17.81]Hey, how do I, how do I fucking... When I'm on a weapon, how do I scroll to get a different fucking weapon?
[65:25.06]Etalyx, how do I do this?
[65:27.92]Uh, hold tab?
[65:28.88]Yep.
[65:29.64]And then you can click the arrows, I think, or mouse wheel or something?
[65:32.90]Yep, yep, that's it.
[65:37.38]I'm listening to, uh, some sick songs here, because I don't know how to turn off the radio.
[65:45.42]I want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world, Jerma.
[65:49.25]Yeah, well, hey, this one's for Robin!
[65:54.63]This is what you did to Robin!
[65:56.99]You sick fuck!
[66:02.28]We're just sitting on the top of the mountain.
[66:03.70]Will you get up here if you can?
[66:05.84]Okay.
[66:06.66]I'm working on it.
[66:07.98]Get up here.
[66:08.44]Come on, come on, come on.
[66:10.40]Whoa, somebody gave a hundred bucks.
[66:14.42]Ten thousand bits.
[66:16.42]This car is dead.
[66:17.35]By KXZ501.
[66:18.37]And they don't say, they just say Swift Rage.
[66:23.19]Swift Rage.
[66:25.20]Well, thank you, KX, for the $100 for your ultra-swift rage.
[66:31.80]Uh, that's very much appreciated.
[66:33.22]Hope you're, um... Hope you're having a good day.
[66:36.64]Thank you.
[66:38.04]That's so much fucking money.
[66:40.43]And, like, my phone's blowing up.
[66:44.63]Spoilers?
[66:45.37]Who doesn't?
[66:46.25]What?
[66:47.65]I was saying, like, over the years, he's very, very annoying to Robin and the Bat and Batman.
[66:55.05]In the same time, thank you, Dedo, again, for your... Oh, look at all those swift rages.
[66:58.33]Holy shit.
[66:59.88]Thank you for these six bucks from Dedo.
[67:02.28]He's getting back at you for playing Arkham VR.
[67:07.52]Thank you, ThatGuyTag, for the five bucks.
[67:09.08]Much appreciated.
[67:09.76]And CreamSoda, thank you for the five bucks as well.
[67:14.37]You guys rock.
[67:16.47]That's...
[67:18.09]That's so, so humbling to know that somebody wants to give me money.
[67:21.23]I guess you're dead now.
[67:21.81]Like I said a thousand times.
[67:22.93]Wait, no.
[67:23.63]There's a guy named Biat in here who's dead.
[67:25.41]Love y'all.
[67:28.00]We're all just kind of hanging out up here.
[67:29.06]How did they even find you?
[67:30.26]This person doesn't have a nameplate anymore, which means they're a free kill.
[67:35.52]Killed a president?
[67:37.82]You killed a president?
[67:39.58]What does that mean?
[67:52.38]Okay.
[67:54.10]You killed everyone.
[67:57.09]Now the hacker's really gonna get you.
[67:59.81]Why are they all one-handed?
[68:01.21]I feel like I'm missing out.
[68:08.34]You gotta get up, man.
[68:09.28]I'm working on it, man.
[68:10.58]It's stupid.
[68:11.38]I don't have hacking skills.
[68:12.66]I gotta go the old-fashioned way up here.
[68:22.52]I guess I was the bad guy all along.
[68:25.63]That's the twist.
[68:26.65]You were the werewolf.
[68:28.75]Yeah.
[68:30.41]I was the bad guy.
[68:31.23]I'm not locked in here with you.
[68:33.39]My stomach is starting to hurt.
[68:35.47]You're locked in here with me.
[68:39.47]Where is this person?
[68:47.90]It was a very peaceful Sunday drive up the mountain.
[68:51.40]I'm not sure, you know... I'm gonna say this.
[68:54.44]I don't think any of these people are the hacker.
[68:58.12]I really don't think so.
[68:59.90]I think mass hysteria set in, and we started blaming people.
[69:03.94]Everyone thinks everyone's the hacker.
[69:05.66]Yeah.
[69:05.82]Because would you be able to kill the hacker?
[69:09.92]Probably not.
[69:11.40]No.
[69:11.64]I'm almost there!
[69:16.60]Finally!
[69:18.00]Did I get my PAX East tickets?
[69:19.18]Yes, I did.
[69:19.83]I will be at PAX East all three days.
[69:22.51]Hallelujah, I see the top.
[69:31.11]I'm such a... I shot that guy with a shotgun.
[69:33.19]That's not fair.
[69:33.87]Alright, ready?
[69:39.05]I'm going to get insta-killed when I get up here.
[69:41.49]It's alright.
[69:42.01]You respond right on the mountain.
[69:43.39]Okay, I'm here.
[69:47.20]Ugh.
[69:54.02]Alright, I'm at the very top.
[69:57.98]The real hacker was the friends we made along the way.
[70:00.88]Yeah, I'm right there too.
[70:01.78]Alright, so... I'm gonna do the funny thing where we all get in a car and drive off the mountain.
[70:11.88]Found you.
[70:12.56]Alright, I'm gonna... Oh, he's pointing at you.
[70:22.55]Oh, he just stabbed me!
[70:23.75]Fuck.
[70:30.09]I don't want any of that action.
[70:34.15]No thank you.
[70:38.12]The baseball bat is the best melee weapon.
[70:40.44]It just is.
[70:40.96]It's so long and comical.
[70:45.32]This is a comedy weapon.
[70:46.38]I don't care what anybody says.
[70:50.34]The baseball bat is THE comedy weapon.
[70:55.12]There's something about hitting somebody, like, in this game with the baseball bat, like, right in the crown of the fucking head.
[71:00.40]It's just so... Hey, what button is to set off explosives?
[71:04.70]Oh, please go off.
[71:05.80]Oh my god, I would've fucking shit my pants if you fell off.
[71:12.41]How do you set... How do you set explosives?
[71:15.11]Uh, I think it's down?
[71:15.69]I already set them, I just don't know how to... It's, like, down on the deep on your, uh, keyboard, I think.
[71:20.55]Like, the down arrow or the left arrow or something.
[71:26.93]It's so long.
[71:33.51]Am I doing a meet-up at PAX East?
[71:34.65]Yes, I am.
[71:35.23]Yes, I'm doing a meet-up.
[71:36.17]Did you just kill everybody?
[71:37.92]Yeah, he came and started punching me, so I threw some grenades up in the air.
[71:41.68]Oh, he dropped a lot of money.
[71:44.88]But yeah, I am doing a meet-up at PAX East.
[71:46.72]Alright, let's test this out.
[71:48.02]Probably on Saturday?
[71:51.15]Like Saturday afternoon at some point?
[71:54.63]Here comes a helicopter.
[71:58.59]You just put that on yourself.
[72:00.45]I saw you do it that time.
[72:03.61]Not down.
[72:04.25]I don't know what it is.
[72:05.93]Let's find out.
[72:06.51]Alright, we're all gonna get inside of a car and drive off.
[72:11.42]E?
[72:17.88]That guy just died.
[72:19.14]Oh, no, he didn't.
[72:19.64]I was gonna say, no way.
[72:25.77]Could be E.
[72:27.80]Well, here comes a guy with a helicopter.
[72:31.01]Oh, it is G. I'm going to fuck this up for everybody right now.
[72:35.25]Guys, just... Oh, boy.
[72:37.39]Come on.
[72:39.47]Come on.
[72:42.49]Come on.
[72:45.14]Are you for real?
[72:46.56]What?
[72:47.52]What, Jerma?
[72:48.54]Tell us, please.
[72:49.16]That guy blew up the helicopter that was up here.
[72:52.42]Somebody brought a helicopter and then somebody detonated it with C4!
[72:55.56]Switching weapons with a mouse kinda sucks.
[72:57.60]No, it's awful.
[72:58.14]I'm also respawning at the bottom of the hill kinda sucks.
[73:28.69]You'll burn.
[73:29.53]Oh, yeah, okay.
[73:31.97]Oh, come on.
[73:32.85]I just wish we had that access to the helicopter.
[73:35.69]Oh, yeah.
[73:36.23]More flares are going to break my computer.
[73:37.79]Okay, seriously?
[73:38.41]You spawned close?
[73:39.13]That's a lie.
[73:40.27]Me too.
[73:43.57]Did you not spawn on the mountain?
[73:59.17]What happened?
[74:00.08]This is pretty fun.
[74:04.74]We're waiting for you.
[74:05.34]Can I hit Cal over from here?
[74:08.20]Can you?
[74:11.98]I sure can.
[74:12.78]No!
[74:13.96]He killed Booger Bumps.
[74:22.38]Nice aim.
[74:24.99]Sorry, I had to let go like this.
[74:26.07]Switch tab, switch, switch, switch.
[74:32.83]Did you get him?
[74:40.29]Come rescue me, I don't know where I am!
[74:42.99]Save me!
[74:48.76]Alright, we're driving off in glory and then I guess maybe we can do something else.
[74:53.76]We can move on.
[74:58.00]Wow, nice.
[75:00.16]Getting close.
[75:02.00]Oh, that was real close.
[75:04.68]Oh, that went right by me.
[75:07.56]I love that you guys are in a flare fight and I'm just standing in the middle and I'm not touched yet.
[75:12.36]She's going to miss and hit me right in the face.
[75:18.00]Nice dodge.
[75:18.66]Nice Dark Souls dodge.
[75:21.46]Hey, can I play too?
[75:24.98]Lester.
[75:26.18]Fuck off.
[75:36.08]I was trying to push her.
[75:37.32]Didn't work.
[75:39.06]Alright, let's just get in.
[75:40.12]I'm bringing the car down here.
[75:41.30]We're just driving.
[75:41.94]We're going for like a drive.
[75:42.94]There's no cars.
[75:46.58]We don't have any access to a car.
[75:48.10]But I think somebody... I heard a helicopter.
[75:51.26]Oh, thank God.
[75:53.74]Wait, who the fuck is this?
[75:56.97]This person doesn't have a nameplate.
[76:00.85]Is this an actual...
[76:03.42]Why would you do that?
[76:05.16]That was our only way out.
[76:07.22]That was our only way to get out of this.
[76:10.82]Why would you do that?
[76:13.70]Alright.
[76:15.70]It's time to end this.
[76:18.92]King of the... King of the castle.
[76:23.66]I love how all the opportunities we have to escape just get removed.
[76:31.68]Don't fall backwards, please.
[76:32.94]Hello.
[76:33.94]Are you here?
[76:35.58]Hello?
[76:36.52]Yep.
[76:37.72]Did you see that our only way of escaping was taken from us very drastically?
[76:42.98]Oh, you mean the helicopter was blown up, one of me right underneath it?
[76:49.40]That?
[76:49.78]Yeah.
[76:50.18]No, I saw it.
[76:50.76]Oh, shit.
[76:51.06]Who's throwing those?
[76:52.96]No, no.
[76:53.48]Drop, drop and roll, drop and roll.
[76:57.14]I gotta get out of this.
[76:59.27]I want to get off Mr. Bones' wild ride.
[77:01.09]I do.
[77:03.01]Don't you?
[77:03.99]Don't you want to get off the ride?
[77:05.49]Yeah.
[77:06.41]We've been on this ride for like 25 minutes.
[77:07.79]We should do at least one stunt thing.
[77:09.79]Yeah, the stunt thing I want to do is I want to drive off this with all of us in a car.
[77:15.24]Okay.
[77:16.84]But, okay, here... Oh, my God.
[77:19.22]Watch out.
[77:20.70]Here comes helicopter number three.
[77:24.78]I wonder if this one's going to instantly explode.
[77:26.72]Oh.
[77:29.78]I do like how this guy's name is Commander.
[77:32.08]Good.
[77:32.30]He's in passive mode.
[77:33.42]He's here to rescue us.
[77:34.65]Thank God.
[77:36.67]Get us out of here.
[77:39.75]Move us out of here.
[77:40.89]Forever.
[77:43.33]I'm in.
[77:45.76]Alright, good.
[77:46.96]Now, take us somewhere safe.
[77:49.22]We're away.
[77:50.88]We're free.
[77:51.72]Finally.
[77:53.44]We left one person behind, I think.
[77:55.14]No, like four people.
[77:58.89]Alright, just get us out of this.
[78:01.01]We got to do one big stunt.
[78:04.05]Once the big stunt happens.
[78:07.13]Who changed the radio?
[78:10.41]Wait, you've changed the radio?
[78:11.15]What are you doing?
[78:12.07]Somebody changed the radio.
[78:13.61]I killed someone.
[78:15.16]How did I kill someone?
[78:16.52]Wait, you killed somebody?
[78:17.72]Yeah, look at the bottom left.
[78:18.78]I'm in the helicopter.
[78:19.52]I guess it was the tear gas.
[78:20.52]I didn't know tear gas could kill people.
[78:22.40]For a second, I thought there's nobody driving this.
[78:27.42]I don't know where this guy's taking us, and that's what scares me.
[78:29.56]Uh-huh.
[78:31.11]Could be anywhere.
[78:31.97]And by anywhere, he could just be driving into the ground.
[78:36.01]And in that case, like... I kind of doubt that.
[78:37.69]No, no, he's turning.
[78:40.81]He's turning.
[78:41.13]It's a surprise.
[78:42.17]We've got to see what the surprise is.
[78:44.39]Yeah, I feel like this is kind of a magical mystery ride now.
[78:47.11]We need to know what it is.
[78:48.83]What's at the end of the tunnel?
[78:51.38]Let's watch it just be like the Joker again.
[78:52.86]He just blows us up.
[78:54.98]I've been waiting here the whole time.
[78:59.39]All the copyright music in GTA will potentially fuck up the VOD.
[79:05.32]Maybe he's leading you to... Oh, AC-130.
[79:07.28]Oh, that's what he wants.
[79:09.40]And we all get our own helicopters.
[79:10.72]Perfect.
[79:11.90]Alright, be careful when you jump out, though.
[79:18.16]You're the only one that got off that helicopter safely.
[79:20.40]Alright, I want this.
[79:23.10]Well, you better get it before they do.
[79:24.54]Oh, I'm gonna get it, don't you worry.
[79:26.44]I swear to God I'm the fucking Joker.
[79:28.29]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[79:31.25]I was gonna say, if the Joker comes over here and blows up... Did I get it?
[79:35.41]Are we in?
[79:38.15]I can't tell.
[79:39.91]It's gonna blow up in like 10 seconds.
[79:43.02]Why is it not driving?
[79:43.48]Oh, we're in.
[79:45.24]You gotta figure out the flying command.
[79:46.74]It's probably like shift and control.
[79:48.42]Holy fuck, dude.
[79:49.06]Doing this with a keyboard and mouse?
[79:50.96]No way.
[79:52.16]We're not taking off.
[79:53.84]Alright, hold like S and W. I'm holding W right now.
[79:56.61]How do you pitch?
[79:57.45]It's probably S. Is it S?
[79:58.75]S?
[79:58.81]No, it's not.
[80:00.25]You gotta try S. You better figure it out real quick.
[80:03.79]E-R-F-T.
[80:04.87]Shift.
[80:05.83]It's shift.
[80:06.21]It's shift.
[80:06.53]No, it's not.
[80:10.62]Oh, no.
[80:12.46]What?
[80:13.00]Oh, my God.
[80:26.47]Oh my god, what did I do?
[80:29.04]I hit R and F and I... Oh fuck, I killed everybody.
[80:38.06]I'm so sorry.
[80:39.76]Oh my god.
[80:40.06]I don't know how I escaped.
[80:42.22]You got out of that?
[80:43.30]I got out before it crashed.
[80:44.82]I don't know how.
[80:45.62]I appeared on the ground.
[80:47.05]Wait, I wasn't... Wait, I wasn't piloting.
[80:54.43]No, I was.
[80:54.99]It wasn't you?
[80:55.76]It definitely was, right?
[80:57.54]Oh my god, I'm already crying.
[80:59.58]I don't know.
[81:00.30]I wasn't piloting, so I just freaked out and jumped out of the plane?
[81:03.94]I think so, yeah.
[81:06.72]No, there's no way, dude.
[81:08.08]I had to have been piloting that.
[81:11.75]No way.
[81:14.25]Oops, I accidentally commandeered this guy's helicopter.
[81:17.01]It's alright.
[81:19.03]What is that giant plane?
[81:20.09]Can we use that?
[81:23.03]What did he do?
[81:23.52]What's this guy doing?
[81:26.45]I think he's typing.
[81:28.01]Oh, he's typing?
[81:29.61]He says, hacker is pushing out of planes.
[81:31.93]I think he's talking about me.
[81:38.10]It's this guy, Commander.
[81:39.26]He said, hacker is pushing out of planes.
[81:42.54]Oh, look at the giant plane behind you.
[81:46.38]Oh, there's three planes all around you.
[81:49.40]Whoa!
[81:49.90]Whoa!
[81:50.20]Okay, this is not okay.
[81:52.56]This is not okay.
[81:54.39]I don't think this is okay.
[81:56.91]I'm going to go try to get in one.
[81:58.10]Me too.
[82:00.04]Dude, this shit is not okay.
[82:01.06]They're like pure chrome planes.
[82:03.52]I'm telling you right now, this shit... We're going to get in some trouble for this.
[82:07.58]These aren't drivable, are they?
[82:08.81]These are like the commercial jets from the airport.
[82:11.97]Etalyx, I think these are drivable.
[82:14.05]Really?
[82:17.73]I'm trying to get in.
[82:18.51]Somebody's already next to one.
[82:19.79]I'm in one.
[82:22.00]This is not okay.
[82:22.82]Don't go yet.
[82:23.48]I'm not going yet.
[82:25.46]Me and Rodian are here.
[82:27.08]This is not good.
[82:28.58]I don't want to be doing this.
[82:30.20]I don't want to condone this type of behavior in GTA Online.
[82:34.89]You're going to get banned by Twitch.
[82:37.81]That was a good burp.
[82:38.87]It was.
[82:40.03]How do I get this out of here?
[82:43.82]I don't know how you got in.
[82:44.98]Everyone is scrambling around trying to get in.
[82:51.16]This is stuck in a mountain.
[82:54.01]Dude, this shit is stuck in a mountain, guys.
[82:56.61]I can't go anywhere.
[82:58.07]Okay.
[83:00.03]In that case... Wait, I might be able to wedge out.
[83:05.03]I'm so tempted.
[83:08.30]It's trying.
[83:09.40]It's trying desperately to get out.
[83:15.24]I think you're stuck.
[83:16.50]Oh, come on.
[83:17.26]Can somebody push me?
[83:19.02]Somebody get in your monster truck and push me.
[83:23.40]Yeah, good luck.
[83:25.20]I don't think that's gonna work.
[83:26.60]Can this blow up?
[83:29.02]I don't think it can.
[83:29.62]I think it's, like, invulnerable.
[83:32.16]What about the other one?
[83:33.72]Oh, you're definitely wedged.
[83:34.74]That's not going anywhere.
[83:35.98]Look at your left wing.
[83:36.86]Now I can't even... Now I'm in the plane.
[83:39.49]No, I'm good.
[83:42.31]Alright, well, that was a bust.
[83:44.21]Although, like, I... Easy.
[83:47.13]I killed someone on accident.
[83:48.39]My bad.
[83:49.77]Okay, what about the one that's down here?
[83:51.97]What's the other one?
[83:52.61]Oh, it's right there.
[83:54.71]How do you fly?
[83:55.93]Uh, I don't know, but somebody's moving this.
[84:03.03]How does this shit even exist?
[84:04.33]It's gotta be shift, right?
[84:05.75]No, it's W. Did anybody... Oh, by the way, yeah, guys, found the werewolf.
[84:10.78]There he is.
[84:12.16]There's the werewolf.
[84:17.10]How do you go forward?
[84:19.64]Hold mouse 1?
[84:21.04]Oh, my... What the fuck?
[84:22.08]Oh, it's awful!
[84:24.34]Okay, this is really sincerely freaking me out.
[84:28.41]I'm gonna try the other one.
[84:36.08]He's barely getting that to move.
[84:42.54]Wait, he's not the werewolf.
[84:45.96]Wait a minute.
[84:48.27]What did you just do?
[84:54.06]I'm not sure I can even get in this.
[84:56.18]Oh, alright.
[84:56.80]Yeah, that's getting in it, I guess.
[85:02.78]Okay, maybe we can get some leverage here.
[85:07.27]I am in the plane with you, so... Okay.
[85:10.09]Don't... I don't know how.
[85:11.03]I mean, I'm moving.
[85:13.79]We get cinematic cam right now.
[85:15.93]This just... This just ain't... I mean, I'm using the mouse, but there's not enough room.
[85:21.04]This thing's too big.
[85:24.27]This thing is just annoying.
[85:25.81]Can you get rid of the telephone poles for me?
[85:29.45]Can you knock those down?
[85:31.85]I'm in the plane.
[85:33.95]This thing ain't going anywhere.
[85:36.42]Good luck with this.
[85:37.32]Wait, wait.
[85:37.78]I might be able to squeeze it out of here.
[85:40.80]You can go back and to the right a little ways.
[85:43.60]I'm trying to back up right now.
[85:46.04]Hold on.
[85:50.13]It's getting caught on the trees.
[85:54.93]No, this ain't leaving.
[85:57.19]Oh, hold on.
[86:00.17]Oh, hold on.
[86:00.77]He's got to wiggle it a little bit.
[86:04.15]There's a train.
[86:05.17]There's a fish.
[86:06.02]Like, this is a fish.
[86:08.08]I'm trying to drive a whale.
[86:10.72]This is a beached whale.
[86:11.44]Not going to work.
[86:13.34]Where'd the train go?
[86:13.96]I don't know.
[86:14.98]It's not going to work.
[86:15.48]The train's gone.
[86:20.62]That hurt.
[86:22.56]Hold left click and use the mouse to steer.
[86:24.12]Yeah, it can't even take off.
[86:25.96]It's like hitting these.
[86:29.56]Now I hear the train again.
[86:30.76]It's being just wedged in.
[86:35.39]It can't back up and it can't go forward.
[86:38.37]Wait, what do you mean?
[86:39.09]Where's the train?
[86:40.55]I don't know.
[86:41.43]I saw it coming this way.
[86:42.83]Maybe it was going the other way, but I could have sworn it was going this way.
[86:46.23]Really?
[86:48.87]Did somebody hack the train too?
[86:52.88]See, somebody's in there right now trying to get it to work.
[86:58.43]See, I told you.
[87:01.01]It just don't fit.
[87:01.95]Alright.
[87:11.31]These guys are useless.
[87:13.01]Alright, I think we're going to have to call this one a... Oh, there's grenades on the ground.
[87:18.18]Wait, what is on the ground?
[87:21.56]Um...
[87:23.02]What the hell is that?
[87:23.56]It was a beer bottle.
[87:25.98]Okay.
[87:26.40]Alright.
[87:30.48]Alright.
[87:31.52]I think that's the extent of the insanity.
[87:34.95]Yeah.
[87:35.93]Although, unfortunately, it may have been nice to see this in the air.
[87:39.59]Yeah, I was going to say.
[87:41.03]That would be the end.
[87:43.64]That would have been a good the end, I would think.
[87:46.70]But... Ow.
[87:47.84]Ow.
[87:56.16]I love how this thing is... How is this thing... This thing doesn't make any sense.
[87:59.82]It's just floating around.
[88:00.66]Three punchers to the face versus two hatchets.
[88:02.68]Okay.
[88:04.52]The physics of this... There's a shootout over your body.
[88:06.61]This shit just don't even work.
[88:12.17]I mean, I kind of want to try to... Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[88:16.89]Oh.
[88:18.35]I just got hit.
[88:22.12]The end.
[88:23.86]Yeah.
[88:24.30]Why can I shoot from this far away?
[88:29.14]Who the fuck is this naked guy?
[88:30.34]I don't know.
[88:33.82]Is this a player?
[88:34.38]No, this is... I'm not gonna do it.
[88:41.17]Oh, okay.
[88:41.89]That was just a scared naked guy.
[88:43.49]Alright, never mind.
[88:47.47]I'm gonna snipe this guy out of his fucking helicopter.
[88:49.61]Stingers seem really overpowered.
[88:54.82]Shit.
[88:55.74]I almost had him.
[88:59.21]Story of my life on the walk to work.
[89:02.48]Alright, well I'm gonna get in this.
[89:04.80]I'm gonna just drive.
[89:05.42]Alright, we're gonna do a 30 second drive and that's it.
[89:11.58]I'm gonna try for... I'm gonna try to knock this thing out.
[89:16.83]I'm gonna move this thing.
[89:18.43]You guys don't think I'm gonna get this thing to move?
[89:22.49]It's gonna be me.
[89:23.11]I'm gonna be the one that saves the day.
[89:28.73]I don't think I'm tall enough.
[89:30.19]I'm not tall enough to... Oh, God.
[89:32.13]Why did I have to just say that?
[89:34.01]I don't think I'm tall enough to touch this.
[89:38.92]No.
[89:40.82]You need 30 minutes.
[89:43.30]I want to do that, too.
[89:45.48]I want to be on that side.
[89:46.30]Let me do that.
[89:48.09]Okay, that guy.
[89:50.69]Let me do that, too.
[89:51.41]I want to hang off the side.
[89:54.98]I want to hang off the side of that thing.
[89:57.36]Come here.
[89:59.21]We're all trying to do the same thing.
[90:03.63]I want to do that fun thing that that guy was just doing.
[90:10.11]The blades aren't going to help.
[90:13.17]What are you doing?
[90:17.71]How is this helicopter still standing?
[90:19.85]How is the helicopter still alive?
[90:21.38]I don't know.
[90:23.45]It just blew up.
[90:24.57]Apparently it just did.
[90:25.45]Dave wedged it up.
[90:28.64]How do you hang up the side?
[90:31.80]I think it's for special cars.
[90:33.34]I don't know.
[90:33.84]Yeah, this one.
[90:34.40]You should be able to hang off the back.
[90:38.80]I just pulled Joker out and sat in.
[90:42.26]Yeah.
[90:44.08]I just pulled this guy out and sat in.
[90:48.65]Whoops.
[90:50.79]So how is he doing that?
[90:51.87]How do you do that?
[90:52.31]I don't know.
[90:54.17]You're not going to find out that way.
[90:55.25]Oh shit, he's not going to be able to answer my question.
[91:00.56]Oh no.
[91:01.20]This guy's got the right idea.
[91:06.14]This guy's got the right idea.
[91:08.36]Oh no, we turned into all out fucking... I saw a baseball bat and I just saw red.
[91:17.01]Look at that car.
[91:18.69]Look at the car under the plane that I just put down there.
[91:22.84]Twitch police are here.
[91:24.26]Your ass is grass.
[91:27.20]Speaking of police here, the police finally showed up.
[91:31.48]Hey, you know, there's a giant fucking chrome plane over here.
[91:35.60]There's a giant chrome plane.
[91:37.76]And people are murdering each other, but you know.
[91:41.45]We'll get to that in 40 minutes.
[91:46.82]Yeah, did you notice the giant alien plane that landed?
[91:49.72]Yeah, now let's shoot at it.
[91:53.05]What are we going to do about this?
[91:55.83]Oh, fuck.
[91:57.47]Oh, no, we're just scared.
[92:00.03]I don't know what to do.
[92:01.33]I've turned into a normal pedestrian.
[92:03.09]Look at that hero.
[92:05.67]This guy.
[92:05.85]This dude.
[92:13.12]This guy right here.
[92:14.50]Dude, come on, man.
[92:15.42]What do you think your training was for?
[92:17.94]You've been trained for this.
[92:20.02]Get out there and you investigate what happened to that chrome plane.
[92:23.65]You know what I'm saying?
[92:34.93]What is happening?
[92:37.56]Why was this cop just driving the old time?
[92:40.78]He's not even holding a gun.
[92:41.92]He didn't even have a gun.
[92:46.06]What is fucking happening?
[92:49.43]That guy was holding a pretend gun.
[92:54.47]Does this guy have a pretend gun too?
[92:55.99]Why are they all the same guy?
[93:05.66]I think they're shooting at each other.
[93:08.14]I think those cops are just shooting at each other.
[93:13.55]This is fucking crazy.
[93:15.19]That cop said swears.
[93:19.01]He's just driving away.
[93:21.59]Okay, so... Fucking god, I love this.
[93:25.10]This game is so... Etalyx, don't you think this is like one of the greatest games?
[93:31.66]It's just fun just to have dumb idiot shit happen.
[93:35.44]Oh, no.
[93:39.30]This is... I think I... No, this is the werewolf.
[93:43.10]Yep.
[93:44.92]Get a good look.
[93:45.82]Actually, I think Steam is why my computer was having so much trouble.
[93:49.20]Yeah.
[93:52.50]Get a good look.
[93:52.98]I think it is this person.
[93:53.96]That was the werewolf.
[93:56.18]I think so.
[94:02.69]Yeah.
[94:03.76]So, you know, in regular aerodynamics, when you're on the ground, you're in the air in less than a second.
[94:12.23]That's usually how aerodynamics work.
[94:13.53]That's how helicopters work.
[94:17.81]And, yeah.
[94:19.40]And as you see, sometimes you go back in time or forward in time.
[94:23.96]Seems to happen, you know, whenever you get in a car with someone.
[94:30.62]It makes perfect sense.
[94:32.80]And I think... We're just... We cannot seem to crash.
[94:40.82]You know, let's do that again.
[94:42.96]Let's see that again.
[94:44.72]Why not?
[94:47.92]Okay, my stream's done.
[94:48.94]My computer's on fire.
[94:50.12]Wait, your computer's, like, on fire?
[94:53.00]No, it's not.
[94:54.15]Actually, Steam was taking up 19% of my CPU for some reason.
[94:58.69]Oh, wow.
[94:59.61]That's weird.
[95:00.01]Yep.
[95:00.65]So, that's why I was having so much problems.
[95:03.25]Blame Steam.
[95:04.15]PC Master Ray.
[95:05.51]Well, hey, we found the werewolf, by the way.
[95:09.29]Oh, really?
[95:10.07]Who is it?
[95:10.81]It was Cat Lover.
[95:11.74]That was the werewolf the whole time.
[95:13.46]I called it.
[95:14.02]That was the first one I said.
[95:15.06]Yep.
[95:16.50]How did you find out?
[95:20.85]How was it revealed?
[95:21.81]Because we're in the water right now in a helicopter.
[95:27.12]Oh.
[95:27.30]And we're still okay.
[95:30.52]And now we're not.
[95:31.24]Now we're on a boat.
[95:32.58]He took me to his boat party.
[95:36.01]Okay, I'm going to get out now.
[95:37.49]I'd like to get out.
[95:38.27]I can't get out.
[95:39.41]I guess I can.
[95:44.64]Is he drowning you?
[95:46.18]Kind of.
[95:47.26]Kind of.
[95:48.92]Well, anyways, let me say this before you leave.
[95:52.42]Thanks for playing the games.
[95:53.23]It was fun.
[95:54.35]Yeah, it was fun.
[95:56.45]I can't swim.
[95:56.93]It looks like you're in a lot of pain just watching, seeing what you're going through right now.
[96:02.35]And...
[96:03.69]I'm punching the air.
[96:04.69]I can't go anywhere.
[96:06.17]My god.
[96:06.71]I cannot swim.
[96:07.66]I can't go up or down.
[96:09.12]I'm dead.
[96:09.50]That's it.
[96:12.87]I'm fucking just dead.
[96:15.89]But yeah.
[96:18.12]That was fucking funny.
[96:19.70]This was a funny stream.
[96:21.08]There was a lot of fun things.
[96:23.42]We've encouraged hackers.
[96:26.22]I really don't want to do that.
[96:27.34]They're pretty funny.
[96:29.04]Sometimes when shit like this happens, what do you do?
[96:33.25]You blame Rockstar.
[96:35.47]If you're going to get potentially followed around in lobbies, what am I supposed to do?
[96:41.42]Like, what are we, what are you and I supposed to do, right?
[96:43.34]Like, just run away?
[96:44.74]No, you take it head on.
[96:47.34]Like this.
[96:48.40]There's the werewolf.
[96:49.46]What do you do to the werewolf in the werewolf game?
[96:53.80]She's unkillable.
[96:56.17]She's unkillable.
[96:57.55]I still think there's more than one hacker.
[97:00.15]Yeah.
[97:00.97]So, uh... She's dead.
[97:12.24]Well, there's a good place to end the video.
[97:15.72]There's a good place to end the stream.
[97:21.58]Is she just like, TF2 kill?
[97:23.70]Like, kill command?
[97:25.06]Pretty much.
[97:29.81]Well, it was fun, everybody.
[97:30.73]Thanks for having me.
[97:31.31]Everybody, if you're not following Etalyx, you very much well should.
[97:35.45]When my computer works, sometimes streams are fun.
[97:38.25]He's a very swell man.
[97:39.41]He's a very fun, very funny dude.
[97:40.91]Follow him, twitch.tv/Etalyx, right?
[97:44.76]Yes.
[97:45.97]That is correct.
[97:46.59]And thank you.
[97:48.19]I love you all so much when you're not douchebags, which is most of you.
[97:52.79]And sometimes you're not, but you know what I'm saying?
[97:55.67]Etalyx is being real mean tonight.
[97:57.27]What is this mean streak?
[97:58.35]Hey, you don't see them when you're not looking.
[98:02.62]Well, you could say that about, like, cereal.
[98:04.80]Integrity is who you are when no one else is looking.
[98:07.70]I don't know where cereal is when it's not in the cabinet, right?
[98:11.08]Hey, if a tree... Hey, when you're on your tea break, guess who's still here?
[98:14.49]It's me.
[98:15.03]Hey, if a tree falls in the forest, does it still fucking get soggy in milk?
[98:20.49]You know what I mean?
[98:27.44]Yeah?
[98:27.66]It does.
[98:28.76]Yeah.
[98:31.36]So that was a good point.
[98:32.95]Yeah, well, regardless, you're a fucking swell guy.
[98:36.45]Thanks for playing.
[98:37.13]Thanks for having fun.
[98:39.26]My pleasure.
[98:40.06]See you guys next time.
[98:41.10]Yeah, take it easy, dude.
[98:42.90]Are you getting off?
[98:44.22]Or are you going to be around later?
[98:45.46]I'm going to go grab some food and watch this guy fall and then immediately kill him.
[98:51.43]Because that was... What a mistake, both of you.
[98:53.61]What a mistake.
[98:55.05]Well, I'll be around.
[98:56.49]Catch you guys later.
[98:57.79]Yeah, I'll see you soon, dude.
[99:01.15]Alright.
[99:02.91]So that means, ladies and gentlemen, that is the end.
[99:08.96]Well, not starting soon.
[99:10.38]We're not starting soon.
[99:11.75]We're ending.
[99:13.73]That was a fun night.
[99:15.41]Thank you, everybody, for showing up.
[99:18.15]First game was a little slow, but it was fun.
[99:21.46]But I would say maybe in like a year of development it might be worth playing.
[99:26.48]And GTA is obviously always just a blast every time.
[99:30.88]If you happen to jump in the lobby and you got to have fun, then thanks.
[99:35.76]Much love.
[99:36.73]Take care, everybody.
[99:38.13]I'm not going to be around for the next few days.
[99:40.29]I'm going to be in Washington, D.C.
[99:43.29]Love you too.
[99:46.31]Yeah.
[99:47.33]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[99:48.43]I'll see you guys on Tuesday when I'm back.
[99:51.53]And with that... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[99:55.92]Wait, hold on.
[99:56.46]I was about to hit the stream off button.
[100:00.30]I was gonna hit the stream off button and then do KX with 100 bucks.
[100:05.53]Thank you, KX501.
[100:07.23]Shine on, you lovable son of a gun.
[100:08.83]Well, thank you, dude.
[100:11.83]You've been, like, dropping money tonight.
[100:15.13]So, thanks so much, man.
[100:17.47]It's never expected, but obviously, like, that's all I can say is thanks.
[100:21.54]Thanks for being around.
[100:22.38]Thanks for enjoying the streams.
[100:23.56]Thanks for having fun.
[100:24.68]That's all I care about.
[100:26.62]And with that, ladies and germs, have a good night.
[100:30.16]Take care.
[101:02.88]you
