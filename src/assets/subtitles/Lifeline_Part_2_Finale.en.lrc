[00:01.27]this shirt is like wet with sweat alright let me set this up see everything we're just fine everything's fine move that over here
[00:25.20]Uh... Ah, there's seven fucking thousand people here.
[00:28.98]I'm gonna change off from IRL, we're gonna go back to Lifeline.
[00:31.12]I'm gonna try to finish Lifeline!
[00:37.73]Or I'm gonna try, at least a handful of times.
[00:43.79]Let's see, trying to finish... Talk at Game.
[00:49.99]Game.
[00:53.53]You look kinda pale.
[00:58.47]I feel... I kind of feel... I feel pretty good.
[01:08.82]Trying to finish to finish.
[01:11.08]That's a good title.
[01:13.24]Trying to finish to finish.
[01:16.08]Right?
[01:16.44]That's literally what's going on.
[01:22.01]Lifeline.
[01:26.91]This is a joke on a joke.
[01:30.13]Okay.
[01:31.01]Move that out of the way.
[01:32.73]If you were participating only for the festivities of... Well, it wasn't really festivities.
[01:38.36]It was more along the lines of... Just me sitting here with a bunch of goofy, dumb shit on.
[01:48.40]Panicking and nothing happening, so... If you enjoyed that, I'm glad you did.
[01:53.26]But we're going to transition to a stupid PlayStation 2 game where you have to yell at the microphone.
[01:58.34]If you want to see what it looks like...
[02:00.39]Here it is.
[02:08.91]That's unfortunate.
[02:19.24]This is the microphone I have to use.
[02:20.52]It goes like this.
[02:23.78]And you have to talk to the lady on the screen
[02:29.79]Ah, was somebody saying big bits came in?
[02:44.09]Debunk.
[02:44.81]I might not have the right hairstyle for that.
[02:47.33]Alright, let me turn on the PlayStation 2.
[02:49.79]Let's boot it up.
[02:57.87]Reset transformation on that.
[03:03.86]We're gonna try to just go right where we left off.
[03:07.02]Why is this so small?
[03:11.14]Shouldn't be like that.
[03:15.15]The PlayStation 1 sound is better.
[03:19.69]Broluck.
[03:21.19]Broluck, you are at the 24-hour cool-off period, man.
[03:25.95]That's $100 from Brolog.
[03:28.73]You are actually at the cool-off period.
[03:31.07]It hadn't even been 24 hours.
[03:34.37]We got $900 now?
[03:34.71]$950.
[03:34.79]Or $905.
[03:35.01]Oh my god.
[03:36.45]Ugh.
[03:54.88]Holy shit, man.
[03:58.70]Nearly a fucking thousand dollars.
[04:00.78]Alright, let's go here.
[04:08.55]Make sure I get my tabs open, because I just started here.
[04:12.05]Let's bring the volume down a little.
[04:13.83]That belongs over here.
[04:23.93]But, Rollick, honestly, I really hope that you're taking care of yourself first.
[04:31.46]That's an extreme amount of money to give anyone.
[04:35.54]I really hope that you are within your means to be able to do so.
[04:38.42]Thank you so much for the ridiculous amount of money.
[04:44.77]Trying to finish to finish.
[04:49.35]Here we are, updated with the correct information.
[04:56.10]Hold on, I gotta get to the screen first.
[04:57.60]Should have all my tabs, I do.
[05:18.46]Lifeline!
[05:22.01]Sweat check.
[05:22.77]It's the whole shirt.
[05:24.13]We can't do a check on it.
[05:25.09]It's the entire article of clothing.
[05:30.31]So I have to go here.
[05:32.67]Alright.
[05:33.35]We're ready to start.
[05:34.27]If you don't know what's going on... Lifeline is a game where you have to... speak instructions to a girl on the screen.
[05:47.24]And you can't control it any other way.
[05:49.68]It's only through that.
[05:51.99]This is spoilers for this game because literally we're at the last hour or two of the game.
[05:57.03]I might not even complete it because the game is a fucking mess and sometimes does not listen to a goddamn thing you say.
[06:04.60]But I'm gonna try.
[06:10.08]Wrong.
[06:12.58]Well, it is not wrong.
[06:14.58]It's my opinion of- I'm fine.
[06:20.88]I think it's a great game.
[06:22.00]I think it's a great idea.
[06:28.52]I'm not- I'm fine.
[06:29.62]Make sure they can hear me.
[06:34.77]So we're at the last portion of the game.
[06:36.77]Just- Broluck- Broluck.
[06:39.25]Bro.
[06:39.77]Hey.
[06:40.45]Bro.
[06:41.35]Bro.
[06:44.50]Bro.
[06:48.76]Bro, you just... Broluck, that's a thousand dollars.
[06:53.14]A thousand.
[06:53.66]One thousand in one day.
[06:54.64]A thousand dollars in a day.
[06:57.05]One thousand dollars in a day.
[07:07.25]Broluck just donated a thousand dollars.
[07:10.43]Get up.
[07:10.93]Okay, I got it already.
[07:14.29]Uh, they say, alright man, that's it, that's it from me for a while.
[07:17.25]Just letting you know that this amount is okay for me to donate.
[07:20.01]Been watching you since I was in high school, and you helped me along the way.
[07:23.03]The tragic part is, in Australian dollars, 100 bits is $2.
[07:26.14]Enjoy.
[07:26.56]Aren't there any instructions?
[07:31.62]Oh my god.
[07:32.90]Did you just, that's thousands.
[07:37.10]I hope, I hope you got some, like, Monopoly man money.
[07:40.33]Because holy shit.
[07:42.17]Case three.
[07:42.79]Case three.
[07:43.55]Run.
[07:43.89]Yes.
[07:48.77]What was it?
[07:49.19]Fifteen?
[07:49.71]Fifty?
[07:50.33]Fifteen?
[07:50.75]It's not here!
[07:57.96]Someone's taken it already!
[08:00.28]Put a facecam on.
[08:02.42]We'll have to return to their safe haven.
[08:05.76]We need to find Al and Honda.
[08:06.99]You don't even get to see this shit anyways.
[08:09.17]Huh?
[08:14.60]So many people already have no idea what's going on.
[08:19.10]But it's alright.
[08:20.20]There's no time limit on here anyways.
[08:37.07]Is that a good place for me to be?
[08:38.07]Okay.
[08:38.37]Yes, I know what it is.
[08:39.43]I've seen it like ten times now.
[08:41.34]I know it's a bomb.
[08:42.70]The sum of the last digits of today's date.
[08:45.26]Out of sync?
[08:45.88]Oh, there, the webcam is...
[09:11.26]Now we're good.
[09:13.36]Alright.
[09:13.66]Enter the sum of the last digits of today's date.
[09:16.86]Maybe she said January 29th.
[09:17.94]I gotta fix this, because I look like a fucking psycho.
[09:21.34]I need to, like, comb my hair.
[09:22.54]Fifteen, fifty, fifteen, right?
[09:41.93]The game is too loud?
[09:43.81]I got it, I got it.
[09:44.99]The music blasting.
[09:45.87]Alright, let's get to the part where I need to get to.
[09:49.03]Enter the number of guests checked into the hotel.
[10:14.72]It's not 13.
[10:15.04]She's going to stop me.
[10:16.14]She goes, wait!
[10:17.88]Alright, let's go.
[10:19.38]I know what it is.
[10:36.16]Somebody's saying, emulate this and get it to this part, just so I'm able to just go through this part.
[10:42.00]Because it's not the save point until, you'll see what happens here.
[10:44.91]50. 50.
[10:56.94]Okay, what's the next step for defusing this?
[10:58.62]I'm gonna move some of these windows around.
[11:00.46]Yeah, that's back.
[11:05.37]That's a better spot for all my windows.
[11:08.87]Alright, I enter the sum of the last digits of PM Takeyama's birthdate.
[11:12.44]This is the last... What's that?
[11:15.16]How are we supposed to know the Prime Minister's birthday?
[11:21.04]How old is she in the game?
[11:22.08]I actually don't know.
[11:23.22]What do we do?
[11:23.74]What do we do?
[11:24.26]That's a good question.
[11:26.90]It's hopeless.
[11:30.87]You need to keep moving.
[11:35.05]You're right.
[11:37.55]You need to keep moving.
[11:39.37]Did he?
[11:39.73]I don't remember.
[11:45.59]I only saw it last night.
[11:46.85]I have no idea how old this girl is.
[11:51.53]I don't know.
[12:02.75]This part takes 20 minutes and the part where you die takes 5.
[12:08.03]I know, it's hell.
[12:10.59]It's hell doing this.
[12:15.50]Yes, I know, it's 15.
[12:17.82]So it's left soldier, right soldier.
[12:20.12]I gotta be very clear.
[12:21.06]Alright, and the fact that I only have one little health bar, it sucks.
[12:32.07]No, it's not seven.
[12:33.74]Fifteen.
[12:36.24]Okay.
[12:37.16]I'm gonna move this because this is old and I don't want to drink out of this.
[12:42.10]This is the part that I died off like seven or eight times last night.
[12:46.68]Remember, this takes twenty minutes or so to do this part.
[12:50.26]Ugh.
[12:51.32]I gotta get it ready.
[12:59.18]Would you like to take a break?
[13:01.43]There we go, she's gonna do the whole thing with, can we be friends when I get out of here?
[13:05.39]Can we be relatives or something?
[13:08.48]Whatever the fuck she says.
[13:14.76]Yeah, unskippable.
[13:17.48]It's crazy because select skips cutscenes.
[13:22.00]But not this one.
[13:22.92]And not any of the ones leading up to where I need to be.
[13:28.03]For some reason, they decided that that was a good idea.
[13:32.73]I want you to know I really am grateful.
[13:36.09]If it weren't for you, I'd be dead.
[13:37.65]What am I going to say this time?
[13:38.41]What do you think?
[13:47.84]Ready?
[13:49.16]Here we are.
[13:51.18]Complete strangers.
[13:52.68]And trusting one another with our lives.
[13:55.00]I feel like I never went to bed.
[13:55.86]And everyone on Earth oblivious to what's going on.
[13:58.16]Is that weird?
[13:58.92]I feel like I'm still here from yesterday.
[14:00.76]And you know what's funny?
[14:01.92]It was today.
[14:02.68]It was this morning.
[14:12.07]If we get back to Earth safely, you think we could actually meet somewhere?
[14:17.97]Like, normal friends?
[14:21.41]Yeah, on Facebook.
[14:22.39]Add me on Facebook.
[14:24.38]Facebook.
[14:24.78]That is very insulting, actually.
[14:26.78]That's extraordinarily insulting.
[14:48.04]Facebook.
[14:48.64]Yeah, I'll add you on Facebook, I guess.
[14:51.90]Alright, left soldier, right soldier.
[14:57.19]Red lever, yellow lever.
[15:00.05]Red lever, yellow lever.
[15:01.11]Yellow lever, red lever.
[15:02.27]Red lever.
[15:02.69]Red.
[15:03.49]Shoot red.
[15:04.61]Shoot red lever.
[15:07.48]Left soldier.
[15:08.70]Right soldier.
[15:09.96]Red lever.
[15:10.72]Shoot yellow.
[15:11.50]Shoot yellow lever.
[15:12.42]I got it.
[15:19.97]Red lever.
[15:21.47]Shoot red.
[15:23.83]Shoot yellow.
[15:26.59]That's as clear as I could possibly make it.
[15:30.81]Shoot yellow.
[15:33.29]Left soldier.
[15:36.95]Here we go.
[15:38.21]Alright, here we go.
[15:38.71]Come on, come on.
[15:39.11]We're gonna get that first try.
[15:43.18]It's not Lever.
[15:44.94]That's a soap company.
[15:47.00]Lever 2000.
[15:54.07]Shoot yellow left soldier.
[15:56.13]What?
[15:57.63]Soldier.
[15:58.93]It's soldier.
[16:03.64]Red lever.
[16:04.94]Red lever.
[16:07.20]Left soldier.
[16:08.14]I'm not faxing you my feet, okay?
[16:15.93]Pay attention.
[16:22.25]Oh, my God.
[16:22.97]They're about to use a rocket.
[16:26.32]Operator, the shutter.
[16:30.12]I'll buy us some time.
[16:32.00]Hurry.
[16:36.22]Here we go.
[16:37.28]Left soldier.
[16:40.24]Shoot red.
[16:41.14]Shoot.
[16:41.42]Shoot.
[16:42.76]Shoot red.
[16:45.54]Shoot yellow.
[16:49.11]Left soldier.
[16:51.38]Right soldier.
[16:55.15]Shoot.
[16:56.13]I'm not saying shoot.
[17:00.17]Shoot red.
[17:00.85]Left soldier.
[17:04.05]Right soldier.
[17:21.14]Hide.
[17:24.40]Shoot red.
[17:24.98]Hide!
[17:25.38]Hide!
[17:25.63]Shoot red.
[17:27.07]Hide.
[17:27.55]Shoot left.
[17:59.36]shoot red shoot red the right soldier red lever but it's I said shoot red oh my god it's and when you shoot the soldier it doesn't even do anything
[18:30.22]You shoot them, they go, and then they keep fighting you.
[18:35.00]It doesn't do anything.
[18:37.14]It doesn't do anything when you shoot them.
[18:43.21]I can't fucking believe this, that you have to do this whole thing again.
[18:47.15]Somebody just fell asleep at the fucking computer to have this be a reality.
[18:50.95]This is the only save point.
[18:52.57]You have to do the whole entire cutscene again.
[18:54.67]Somebody fell asleep making this game.
[18:56.55]Get up.
[18:57.09]Okay, I got it already.
[19:02.66]Case 3.
[19:03.60]Case 3.
[19:04.74]Okay.
[19:05.12]How do I fast forward the stream?
[19:08.59]Run.
[19:08.99]Yes.
[19:10.11]What are you doing?
[19:10.57]What's going on with this fucking audio and video?
[19:14.79]And I don't have any health.
[19:17.33]They made the health packs like Resident Evil 1 in this game.
[19:20.09]It's not here.
[19:21.47]Someone's taken it already.
[19:22.95]Like, if you run out of them, you lose.
[19:26.33]We have to return to their secret home.
[19:28.69]We need to find Alan Honda.
[19:30.83]Somebody look up for those cheats for the PlayStation 2 version.
[19:32.68]I'll click through the fucking wall.
[19:33.94]I don't care.
[19:44.29]I need to get a game shark.
[19:47.57]The fact that you have to do this again.
[19:55.31]What were you doing when you made this portion?
[19:58.07]How did you think that this was a good- how?
[20:00.14]How is it- why would you make- not have a save point?
[20:03.74]Why would you make this the part?
[20:05.28]And I can't skip it.
[20:06.90]What are we doing?
[20:09.28]Why would you sit in the office?
[20:11.40]And what?
[20:14.82]Did you run out of time?
[20:17.23]Enter the sum of the last digits of today's date.
[20:23.19]Nobody but me got to this point.
[20:26.13]This is a speedrun of this game.
[20:34.88]Skip cutscenes with L2 and select.
[20:40.27]Did I do that already?
[20:41.65]Select worked before.
[20:53.95]I used L2.
[20:54.59]No, they don't work.
[20:57.93]That seems to have worked.
[20:59.51]How about you read the instructions for the next step?
[21:06.08]Enter the number of guests checked into the hotel.
[21:08.50]Thanks for the save point.
[21:09.92]This is easy too.
[21:11.52]The answer was in Tanaka's note.
[21:15.23]It's 13.
[21:16.03]Okay, enter it.
[21:24.26]Save point.
[21:24.76]Use the speedrun as a walkthrough?
[21:50.78]I'm gonna mimic exactly what this person says.
[21:53.42]Dude, I don't think there even is... does it even exist?
[22:13.76]Enter the sum of the last digits of PM Takayama's birthdate.
[22:17.46]What's going on with this fucking thing?
[22:22.24]What the fuck is happening?
[22:23.40]It just got dark.
[22:25.94]Oh my god.
[22:26.80]Yeah, this is how it ends.
[22:33.33]It ends with me fucking snapping.
[22:34.93]I'm going to put the disc in my shredder.
[22:36.51]This is what's going to happen here.
[22:37.79]What?
[22:50.73]Holy shit.
[22:51.51]This cable's broken, I think.
[22:53.31]No, it's not.
[22:53.67]I think we're good.
[22:57.43]Uh, shred the disc.
[23:00.03]Shred this fucking disc.
[23:01.07]I know, I am right.
[23:01.87]That's a big coffee cup, it is!
[23:20.53]I'm a streamer.
[23:21.27]We drink coffee, you know?
[23:22.37]We drink coffee and sip on it for two, four hours straight, man.
[23:26.06]That was a huge vein.
[23:28.92]Did you see that?
[23:47.00]Your blood pressure is rising.
[23:49.86]Alright, should I... Stop talking, lady.
[23:53.96]Alright, here's what I'm gonna try.
[23:57.96]I think I'm just gonna not even worry about the fucking soldiers.
[24:00.81]I'm just gonna shoot.
[24:01.77]I'm gonna... Red lever.
[24:03.07]Yellow lever.
[24:03.55]Red lever.
[24:04.07]Red lever.
[24:04.51]I'm just gonna hide and shoot.
[24:07.28]Every time I try to deal with the soldiers, I say, like, left soldier, right soldier, right soldier, left soldier, and she just doesn't shoot in the right direction.
[24:14.16]We've seen it, like, five times now.
[24:25.61]You have to say, shoot red.
[24:26.73]I just, I tried that.
[24:29.33]Shoot red.
[24:30.83]Shoot red.
[24:32.27]And then everyone got mad because they sang Red Lever.
[24:35.41]And then when I do that, people get mad because they sang Shoot Red.
[24:37.81]This whole time, I've been trying to remember your face, but I can't.
[24:43.41]I don't want to see this again.
[24:45.62]You can't just, while you're talking, walk over to the kiosk and punch in the code to do the save point?
[24:52.54]I want you to know, I really am grateful.
[24:56.76]It's because I have a Boston accent.
[25:00.86]It's, but it's, it's not... Red lever is... It's not like I'm going, ah, red lever.
[25:08.24]Open up the red lever, dude.
[25:11.08]Red lever, red lever, shoot red.
[25:12.76]Red lever.
[25:13.22]That's not what I'm saying.
[25:14.08]Oh yeah, by the way, pick me up some clam chow now while you got a chance.
[25:31.86]If we get back to Earth safely, you think we could actually meet somewhere?
[25:37.76]Like, normal friends?
[25:39.06]Sorry my fucking bastard accent is really screwing this game up.
[25:43.03]I fucking can't help it.
[25:44.45]I say like, ahs and ahs and ahs.
[25:47.79]Look, you don't need to be a jerk.
[25:50.05]I was being serious.
[25:51.07]I have not said like, ah, the whole playthrough.
[25:54.17]Listen to the sound of my voice.
[25:56.29]This is the way I've been talking the whole time.
[25:59.05]We really have to find her.
[26:01.72]Some of you guys are making it sound like I'm like, hey, can you, like, go over there and pick up some of the thing on the ground?
[26:08.11]Don't make me make my fucking chin bigger.
[26:13.09]You can skip it with sweat.
[26:37.67]Sometimes you gotta prove it on the webcam.
[26:52.16]Is it bootleg controller?
[26:53.60]No, it's not.
[26:54.46]This is an officially licensed controller.
[27:00.35]Alright.
[27:00.75]Red lever.
[27:01.81]Red lever.
[27:06.64]I'm stuck in a time loop right now, and I have to get out of it.
[27:09.52]I'm stuck in a time loop.
[27:11.20]I'm stuck in a time loop right now.
[27:14.66]Licensed by Mad Catz.
[27:20.39]Leva!
[27:21.69]I'm just gonna do it with a Boston accent.
[27:26.43]Speedrun strat is to just say red.
[27:29.09]But wouldn't that, she's fucked that up sometimes and think I'm saying right?
[27:48.47]Take a med kit.
[27:49.39]I don't have any med kits.
[27:52.96]There are no med kits.
[27:55.02]There are zero.
[28:18.57]Red.
[28:18.85]Red.
[28:18.99]Red.
[28:19.13]Shoot.
[28:19.33]Red.
[28:19.45]Red lever.
[28:51.10]Hide.
[28:53.52]Right soldier.
[28:56.06]Hide.
[28:59.24]Yellow lever.
[29:03.71]Hide.
[29:08.47]Yellow lever.
[29:13.07]Yellow lever.
[29:15.99]Hide.
[29:17.87]You fucking assholes!
[29:19.97]Red lever.
[29:23.72]Yellow lever.
[29:31.23]Yes!
[29:43.35]What does it say in the walkthrough?
[29:45.68]What does it say in the walkthrough?
[29:46.96]Somebody, please.
[29:48.48]I can't do this again.
[29:49.44]Please give me a save point.
[29:58.58]What happens now?
[30:01.24]What happens now?
[30:11.77]You have to say run.
[30:14.95]Say run.
[30:16.83]Right?
[30:17.15]It was say run when I got the opportunity.
[30:18.81]Say run.
[30:21.59]Run.
[30:22.57]Is that enough to have an accent for you?
[30:26.34]Run.
[30:26.62]Run.
[30:28.49]Run.
[30:28.75]Where do you think you're going, thief?
[30:38.99]Come on, hand over whatever you just took.
[30:41.77]No, it's not it.
[30:43.58]Rio, I'm disappointed with you.
[30:45.70]Gino, forget it.
[30:46.52]We have to run.
[30:47.42]Look, Rio, I will shoot you if I have to.
[30:56.76]Run.
[30:57.04]Is that... Is that...
[31:34.03]Worst ending, I don't care.
[31:37.23]That took like four and a half hours to do that.
[31:41.52]More than that.
[31:45.78]Give me a safe point, please.
[31:48.80]I don't... Do you have... Why would you do this to me?
[31:51.93]There's got to be a safe point in this room.
[31:54.81]What do I do now?
[32:12.40]Run again?
[32:40.84]Should I run again?
[32:42.72]Somebody look it up for me.
[32:44.25]I don't have a computer in front of me.
[32:45.57]I have a PlayStation 2 computer monitor screen.
[32:48.47]I don't have an actual computer.
[32:52.65]Run.
[32:54.39]Run.
[32:55.05]Calm down.
[32:55.95]Corridor open.
[32:56.67]Wait, hold on.
[32:58.66]Okay, run.
[32:59.36]R.I.P.
[33:00.50]Geno.
[33:01.00]I understand.
[33:02.40]I feel the same way.
[33:03.42]He should have been in Smash.
[33:04.68]But you got to give me the actual thing I need to do.
[33:13.40]So it's calmed down.
[33:15.04]I don't care about cheating right now, guys.
[33:16.98]I don't care about a thing about this.
[33:19.96]We're not doing another fucking 42-minute cutscene scenario.
[33:26.51]It's literally sexy pose.
[33:28.33]No, it's not.
[33:28.95]I'm not getting baited that hard.
[33:37.00]It's... No, no, no.
[33:37.66]Somebody just had it.
[33:38.46]You just put it in there.
[33:46.06]Jerm- I can't look it up.
[33:47.52]I have no- Fucking god dammit.
[33:57.76]Spam to keep the advice away!
[34:00.90]I'm trying to cheat here and you're making it very difficult for me.
[34:08.26]Okay, here we go.
[34:09.00]This is- I gotta- I gotta walk through here.
[34:12.38]Let's go all the way to the bottom.
[34:19.85]If it's not sexy pose, I just wanna make sure you guys are aware of this.
[34:24.83]If it's not sexy pose, I'm turning off the stream.
[34:40.36]All you gotta do is make a threat.
[34:44.94]Bring back the music.
[34:49.28]Trying to find a walkthrough of this game is like, it's not easy to find a real one.
[34:57.64]Lifeline PS2.
[34:58.50]Well, I got my computer here.
[34:59.70]I was lying.
[35:01.22]Okay, here we go.
[35:01.78]Here's a walkthrough.
[35:02.50]I don't care.
[35:03.20]I'm going to read this.
[35:05.92]Here's a full walkthrough.
[35:07.72]All the way to the bottom here.
[35:08.62]Because this is the end of the game.
[35:26.32]There's so much more to the game.
[35:30.69]There's like another two and a half hours to this game.
[35:35.03]Okay.
[35:37.73]Use the door.
[35:38.53]Press... Case 3.
[35:42.57]Alright.
[35:42.95]There's the shootout.
[35:45.54]When the Marines show up, it's stuck.
[35:48.86]Later, run when Geno fights the alien.
[35:51.74]If you decide to stay behind and help, you'll be killed.
[35:54.86]Thank God.
[35:56.37]Trust me when I say you don't want to do this part.
[35:59.63]They actually wrote that in the walkthrough of the game.
[36:02.45]Trust me when I say you don't want to do this part again.
[36:06.19]UGH!
[36:07.25]Even in the walkthrough, they hate it.
[36:12.10]After it's all over, tell Rio to cheer up, and on you go to the testing ward.
[36:22.79]There's been an unfortunate incident.
[36:25.95]We said an explosive, but it seems that one of your people has defused it.
[36:30.63]Oh, dear.
[36:30.97]What is that supposed to mean?
[36:32.13]Bomb?
[36:33.69]I never gave you orders to blow up the station.
[36:37.21]Prime Minister.
[36:38.64]We don't take orders from you.
[36:41.10]What?
[36:42.14]Aren't you here to rescue us?
[36:45.76]Rescue you?
[36:47.28]How presumptuous.
[36:48.74]Who on Earth told you that?
[36:50.71]We are soldiers for a new world order.
[36:53.67]Our sole purpose here is to obtain a relic with incredible power.
[36:57.89]Having accomplished our objective, we are now leaving.
[37:02.12]Alan?
[37:03.27]I'm not saying anything.
[37:04.43]I need to be ready to do exactly what this thing tells me to do.
[37:08.97]Imagine having to do this whole thing again.
[37:11.01]Like they said, UGH exclamation point.
[37:33.60]What?
[37:33.80]Are you sure that I just have to cheer up while I'm running into the fire?
[37:46.57]Trust me when I say to then witness the... I have to stall over and tell her to cheer up.
[38:05.91]You monsters.
[38:07.95]You herded them here to kill them, not for rescue.
[38:12.08]Hey.
[38:16.96]Exactly.
[38:18.24]And you've conveniently returned to die as well.
[38:21.30]Cheer up.
[38:24.63]Tell her to cheer up.
[38:28.09]I cursed you.
[38:30.91]Killed a great man.
[38:33.65]Cursed you.
[38:36.07]Gosh, she's the alien.
[38:53.84]She's the alien.
[38:56.40]That's the climax of the story.
[39:00.42]I curse you!
[39:08.00]Sexy pose, yeah.
[39:12.02]I'm sure it is.
[39:21.79]I'm gonna drink Starbucks.
[39:28.69]I brew my own coffee.
[39:30.09]I brew my own coffee with my own percolator.
[39:58.35]Only real, only real coffee enthusiasts do that.
[40:01.86]I used to drink Dunkin' Donuts every fucking day.
[40:04.84]What are you talking about?
[40:06.72]In fact, I think this might even be, this is, okay, I'm gonna return this.
[40:11.12]I'm gonna return wherever I got this coffee.
[40:14.68]That's a hair.
[40:16.30]There's a hair in my coffee.
[40:24.48]That's a big hair.
[40:25.98]Any more hairs?
[40:27.66]It's alright.
[40:29.70]I knew it.
[40:34.90]I'm ignoring the plot.
[40:37.02]Who am I?
[40:37.98]Um, okay.
[40:39.86]I'm a descendant of Paracelsus, the scientist from Alan's disk.
[40:44.02]The story of Paracelsus and the Philosopher's Stone is more than just a legend.
[40:47.85]It's real.
[40:50.03]It's the stone that I've been trying to find.
[40:54.03]It's an heirloom that my family has guarded since Paracelsus' time.
[40:59.08]It began to influence my life when I was only a child.
[41:01.90]Dad began studying the philosopher's stone with a geologist he'd hired.
[41:09.01]The geologist's name was Joseph Craft.
[41:15.03]Those two spent years researching the stone.
[41:19.03]And they eventually uncovered the secret nature of it.
[41:25.09]Physically the philosopher stone is pretty much your basic rock, but what's uncanny about it is the composition completely uniform throughout Whether stone or metal it's impossible to manufacture solids of entirely uniform my hair on Earth Why you ask he's a dog hair of gravity Same night they concluded their analysis of the stone craft shot my dad It's what do you know his hairs?
[41:57.66]This is fucking huge.
[42:02.46]He also shot me.
[42:09.17]I survived.
[42:11.19]But my mom and dad weren't so lucky.
[42:14.11]No save point yet, by the way.
[42:15.53]Kraft was trying to steal the Philosopher's Stone, but Dad had it protected.
[42:21.79]Fearing for my safety, I fled to Japan.
[42:24.39]I just wanted to forget everything.
[42:36.87]Kraft mac and cheese.
[42:43.04]But then I saw it on the news.
[42:44.18]Oh, I gotta... Does my tweet say I'm doing IRL hangout?
[42:50.60]The channel's negative or positive emotion from spoken words.
[42:56.24]With the stone, you can heal or corrupt.
[42:59.74]If I die, I gotta sit through this... I know.
[43:01.60]I don't wanna sit through this again.
[43:03.42]At least according to research data taken by Joseph Kraft.
[43:07.71]From what I can tell, he used the stolen research to build a replica of the stone in the lab on this space station.
[43:16.75]I guess with all the chaos going on, he was planning to steal the real stone and blame it on the aliens.
[43:23.54]Right?
[43:25.54]I mean, this is what we're seeing.
[43:27.68]Even if that means killing everyone in the hotel to ensure their silence.
[43:33.65]But why does he want the stone so much?
[43:36.71]I don't get it.
[43:38.37]What was he going to do with it?
[43:40.01]He does stop that.
[43:42.01]Turn people into hideous monsters?
[43:45.61]He would use the stone for that?
[43:46.93]The Infinity Stone.
[43:50.04]Use the stone for that.
[43:56.16]Cheer up.
[43:56.64]God, I'm just babbling now.
[44:01.00]Well, whatever happens, the craft is finished.
[44:12.61]All we need to do is find Alan's stone and dispose of it.
[44:15.16]No, actually that can wait.
[44:19.32]I'm sorry I've been so caught up in the stone.
[44:22.08]I still have to get you out of there.
[44:23.28]And Naomi too.
[44:25.28]Yes, of course we have to get Naomi.
[44:32.93]But... Listen.
[44:42.24]In spite of all our searching, we haven't found your girlfriend.
[44:45.64]Yeah, that's right.
[44:48.30]You know what's happening.
[44:49.52]I mean, I know Philosopher's Stone and all that, but my girlfriend is missing.
[44:53.52]That alien.
[44:55.05]Or is it some kind of mutated person that's chasing us?
[45:02.67]Could it be?
[45:08.71]Sorry.
[45:10.70]I'm sorry.
[45:11.22]What am I saying?
[45:12.44]Good, you should be.
[45:13.12]There's still the testing ward left.
[45:16.62]That's it.
[45:17.04]She must be in the testing ward.
[45:20.55]The monitor room you're in, it's in the testing ward.
[45:23.67]She's in the... Oh, she's in the room I'm in?
[45:26.13]She's been here the whole time?
[45:28.73]What?
[45:29.55]Oh, yeah, she is.
[45:30.97]She's in a fucking cryogenic lab behind me.
[45:33.19]The three of us can leave this place together.
[45:36.47]I'll go get her now.
[45:38.61]I can get to the testing board on that elevator.
[45:41.45]Wait for me.
[45:46.72]Save point, please.
[45:49.60]Please, God.
[45:53.88]If an enemy spawns right here... We get another cutscene too.
[45:59.86]Another one.
[46:03.44]Is there no save point?
[46:05.20]Is this the end of the game, and if we fuck up, we go all the way back?
[46:13.98]This is it, I think.
[46:14.40]1 HP.
[46:14.48]No save points.
[46:14.84]27 full minutes of cutscenes.
[46:15.98]If we lose.
[46:38.66]Shredding disk on stream is pretty much what... Get... Grab it!
[46:53.35]That just gave me so much anxiety.
[46:56.28]Wait.
[46:56.60]Stop.
[47:13.32]Where's the save point?
[47:14.18]Is there no save point?
[47:25.73]Hatch 3 has HP.
[47:32.14]The guide says there is one.
[47:37.65]If I'm getting baited into opening up a hatch, I'm looking at my own goddamn walkthrough.
[47:42.09]I don't trust a soul here.
[47:45.32]Not in a million years right now.
[47:49.06]A million.
[47:49.72]We're talking about in a million years.
[47:51.10]I don't trust what you guys are saying right now.
[47:56.43]There is a heal.
[48:18.55]Hatch five.
[48:23.79]Hatch five.
[48:24.75]Run.
[48:24.89]Oh, you can't run.
[48:31.60]You can just do, you can just do the, the, uh, alright.
[48:36.16]I have to make this reference and I have to make this joke.
[48:38.62]If you haven't seen The Last Jedi, just delete your computer, okay?
[48:42.97]Because here comes a Last Jedi reference.
[48:44.83]Here it comes.
[48:45.33]Are you ready?
[48:45.73]If you haven't seen The Last Jedi, then mute.
[48:48.03]Mute for the next 30 seconds.
[48:53.47]Good.
[48:53.81]You good?
[48:55.63]What does this remind you of?
[48:56.55]It's the Princess Leia, like, thing, right?
[49:01.03]With she flying back?
[49:03.52]That's the same exact everything.
[49:11.56]Alright, you can... You're good.
[49:13.72]Unmute now.
[49:15.16]Read my lips.
[49:15.96]You can unmute.
[49:19.32]How is that a spoiler?
[49:21.38]Because if... That's a major plot device there.
[49:37.71]On me?
[49:38.09]Yeah, you're good.
[49:48.31]I already gave the ultimate Star Wars reference.
[49:50.49]Well, I didn't.
[49:50.97]Hatch 5.
[49:52.25]Hatch 5.
[50:10.05]I don't think I can go any further.
[50:12.17]I'm turning back.
[50:14.70]Oh, a heal capsule.
[50:18.68]Gerber go to hatch three.
[50:19.72]Gerber go to hatch three.
[50:20.72]Gerber go to hatch three.
[50:21.72]Gerber go to hatch three.
[50:22.72]Gerber go to hatch three.
[50:23.68]Gerber go to hatch three.
[50:24.62]Gerber go to hatch three.
[50:25.62]Gerber go to.
[50:26.24]Recover.
[50:40.22]Where's the save point?
[50:44.90]Did I X out of my fucking walkthrough?
[50:52.18]Hatch two.
[50:54.14]Hatch two, okay.
[51:03.66]The hatch is closed.
[51:05.22]You have to analyze and open it.
[51:10.86]I, I, hold on.
[51:18.86]UGH!
[51:19.14]Okay, hold on.
[51:56.92]There's a save point in here.
[52:02.17]Dremel got a hatch 3.
[52:02.77]Dremel got a hatch 3!
[52:05.27]Dremel got a hatch 3!
[52:05.91]Bright.
[52:06.79]Save point.
[52:07.05]It's right in front of us.
[52:27.25]Oh, I can finally take a sigh of God relief.
[52:45.95]Great Canadian fuck club.
[52:48.65]50 fucking community subs.
[52:52.65]How many community subs do you have now?
[52:57.72]Are you over, like, five or six fucking hundred?
[53:05.79]Fifty.
[53:08.59]Oh my god.
[53:09.65]Did that... That's...
[53:24.37]What is with the money the last few days?
[53:27.27]It's been... I don't have any words, that's... That's a lot of money.
[53:38.73]My god.
[53:40.84]Alright, so we're gonna go to... Thank you so much.
[53:45.06]Thank you so much for the 50 community subs.
[53:49.18]Sample cases.
[53:50.32]Run.
[53:59.45]How much money was 50?
[54:00.65]50 community subs is... Is 5 times 50.
[54:04.15]Uh... Check glass.
[54:10.71]That is.
[54:11.01]Check sample case.
[54:12.55]Check top right sample case.
[54:14.67]Don't open that!
[54:15.85]Don't open that.
[54:28.99]Alright, don't open that.
[54:30.35]Experiment Rack 1.
[54:33.87]Run.
[54:34.03]Smash the glass.
[54:34.55]And eat the monster.
[54:37.81]Run.
[54:38.05]Fly.
[54:59.20]Check control panel.
[55:00.56]It's the panel for controlling the robotic arm.
[55:03.32]At least that's what I think.
[55:04.16]Wiggle it around and try to win the teddy bear.
[55:07.92]Wiggle.
[55:09.90]Ah, control panel.
[55:11.18]It's a panel for controlling an experiment rack.
[55:13.22]Stop.
[55:14.67]Grab control panel.
[55:16.19]It's a panel for controlling an experiment rack.
[55:19.67]Probably.
[55:21.05]Operate control panel.
[55:23.05]The control panel?
[55:24.59]Racking it is pointless.
[55:26.57]What else should I do?
[55:28.07]use control panel using a huge machine like this is way out of my league okay it's all you it's all oh it's inoperable set to emergency mode storage booths the storage booths okay
[55:56.40]I can't even see any of this shit.

[61:35.39]Hey, can you analyze this for me?
[61:41.46]Was Naomi here?
[61:42.14]There's something like a tunnel in the back.
[62:05.10]Could she be beyond there?
[62:11.39]I can't get in there unless the gap is widened.
[62:23.44]What are you doing?
[62:23.86]She's gonna smash your face!
[62:26.80]It's in auto-emergency mode.
[62:28.86]It can't be directly operated.

[64:08.15]Operate to jettison experiment rack into space.
[64:11.23]The operator must enter the disengagement code number within a set time frame.
[64:15.07]Low level emergency mode.
[64:17.93]The experiment rack cannot be moved, but may be ejected into space.
[64:23.17]Okay.
[64:24.18]Please speak to the operator to request input of the release code that appears on the screen.
[64:31.34]If the release code is not entered before it disappears from the screen,

[71:41.91]Isn't this enough?
[71:44.99]Fuck.
[71:52.92]Of all the times to do it, I tried to queue it up.
[71:57.36]God, I tried to skip the cutscene.
[71:58.98]It didn't work.
[71:59.44]I'm sorry.
[72:08.18]Now this is what I have begun.
[72:10.22]It was happening.
[72:10.86]I couldn't find a way to get out.
[72:12.72]Turn off the machine.
[72:15.15]I beg you.
[72:19.33]You.
[72:21.77]What do you want?

[72:38.83]I sensed some sort of crisis in the hotel.
[72:44.64]Do you know of the stone on this station?
[72:50.46]Yes.
[72:52.66]I see.
[72:54.36]I was a fool.
[72:56.12]I thought that the stone would bring happiness to the world, the way it had done for our family.
[73:03.96]Too much corruption in the world.
[73:06.79]Television politicians, the people on the streets, everywhere.
[73:11.73]The evils of jealousy and greed have corrupted our planet.
[73:18.79]This is the world that they would produce more of the stones for.
[73:24.91]I beg you, turn off this machine.
[73:29.20]Alright.
[73:29.96]Who is this supposed to be?
[73:31.62]Thank you.
[73:32.58]This is me?

[75:04.49]Wait, does that destroy the whole complex?
[75:06.47]Alright.
[75:07.73]I don't have so many urges to sneeze lately.
[75:12.51]I don't know why.
[75:13.69]Couldn't sneeze before.

[78:53.32]Am I cursed?
[78:55.36]They all died.
[78:58.65]And man, they couldn't save anyone.
[79:02.17]Itchy nose.
[79:04.05]Could everything...
[79:07.80]I'm gonna sneeze again.
[79:09.46]This time I'm gonna mute and get off the fucking camera.
[79:14.01]What did you just say?
[79:14.59]Everything's all my fault.
[79:18.79]We're gonna get out of here.
[79:20.31]You and me.
[79:20.77]We're gonna get out of this.
[79:21.71]Yes.

[79:36.52]Yes.
[79:36.62]I believe that.
[79:37.00]Yes.
[79:37.10]Yes, I do.
[79:37.91]Yes.
[79:38.05]Yes.
[79:38.21]Yes, I think we can get out.
[79:39.43]Yes.
[79:39.55]Yes, we can get out of here.
[79:40.79]Yes.
[79:40.93]Yes.
[79:41.01]I believe that.
[79:41.37]That is the truth.
[79:41.93]I believe that.
[79:42.93]I'm telling you the truth.
[79:44.31]I'm... We're gonna get out of here.
[79:45.47]We will get out of here.
[80:06.33]We're going to get out of here.
[80:08.35]Tell me the truth.
[80:09.87]Everything, it's all my fault, isn't it?
[80:11.93]No, it's not your fault.
[80:14.84]I'm so sorry.
[80:16.70]I'm so sorry to have gotten you and everyone else involved in this horrible mess.
[80:21.68]There's no way for me to repair the damage I've caused.
[80:24.00]They wouldn't let me say, yes, we're going to get out of here.
[80:28.92]They only asked me to save you.
[80:32.79]Whatever happens, I will save you.
[80:37.24]You can save me.
[80:40.30]Will you wait for me?
[80:42.50]Nope.
[80:45.60]Nope.
[80:46.28]I'm out of here.
[80:47.62]Will you believe me?
[80:48.85]I am out of here.
[80:51.35]Thank you, operator.
[80:55.75]I don't know if you realize this.
[80:57.51]Maybe you already know.
[81:00.54]These monsters.
[81:03.30]Some are actually people who've mutated.
[81:06.52]But not Naomi.
[81:10.40]She lived and died a beautiful woman.
[81:15.45]Okay.
[81:24.88]Welcome to the, we did it.
[81:27.12]Joe Powell.
[81:28.28]Hold it.
[81:29.36]Don't try anything you'll regret later.
[81:31.78]You didn't hear me coming down the hall cuz I floated.
[81:36.79]You like to know what you've done?
[81:42.09]You and the operator.
[81:43.55]You killed the girl that your operator was searching for.
[81:47.18]How ironic that you doomed the one person we were trying to save.
[81:55.30]You turned her into a monster.
[81:57.69]Didn't you?
[81:59.97]I've been in the lab watching everything you've been doing.
[82:03.61]Just as you guessed.
[82:05.39]The story about the UFO is a lie.
[82:08.74]The so-called aliens are nothing more than mutated animals created by the stone and accursed words.
[82:21.79]He's gonna crush it, and he's gonna turn into the final boss.
[82:23.92]I hope he eats it.
[82:25.70]Play it.
[82:26.28]Play it.
[82:26.68]Please play the other audio clip.
[82:47.18]Absolutely.
[82:49.14]Monstrous as she appeared, she never meant to harm anyone, yet you killed her.
[82:55.05]All she was doing was asking for her boyfriend.
[82:59.09]You psycho.
[83:00.03]She didn't mean to kill anyone.
[83:02.45]By the way, everyone's saying, what's wrong with the cameraman?
[83:04.09]This is me.
[83:05.53]I'm the cameraman.
[83:06.17]She was totally unaware of the threat she posed to those around her.
[83:08.87]I don't know where this camera is supposed to be in this space.
[83:13.60]He's been your operator, correct?
[83:16.40]He's been poisoned by the toxin from a mutated caterpillar.
[83:20.68]He'll surely die.
[83:22.16]I'm the one who locked him in the monitor room.
[83:27.11]You're a heartless bastard.
[83:28.99]Well, it's too late to save me.
[83:31.97]Of course, being on this station, it won't make a difference.
[83:35.27]So it was you who altered the station's orbit?
[83:44.40]That's correct, Rio Hohenheim.
[83:49.32]I... still find it puzzling.
[83:52.70]I'm an accomplished marksman, and I was certain I'd shot you in the heart that time.
[83:58.38]But I won't fail twice.
[84:04.31]What did... what just happened?
[84:08.51]Did he not... the... the blowback from the shotgun?
[84:16.16]Oh, did the disc protect me?
[84:22.62]That's got shot point blank with a shotgun.
[84:24.08]Kraft?
[84:50.57]I think you got him.
[84:52.99]When did you get the gun?
[84:55.00]Wait, hold on.
[84:55.86]How, what?
[84:57.78]You didn't see her pulling the gun up?
[84:59.94]You were too busy talking about how your English translated craft name is already translated into English.
[85:06.64]And, by the way, you didn't miss.
[85:11.91]Many years ago, you shot me through the heart.
[85:15.65]And I really did die.
[85:17.75]My father took the stone
[85:20.95]Didn't fucking revive your brain.
[85:22.11]That's why.
[85:22.39]So she IS a Philosopher's Stone.
[85:24.89]At this point I'm gonna be like, Lady.
[85:48.36]I'm not- I don't want- I don't want any- Cease communication, please.
[85:50.80]That guy's dead.
[85:51.42]My English name, Kraft.
[85:54.36]Translated it to Powers.
[86:22.23]Like, what the fuck was that?
[86:23.23]I have control again.
[86:35.47]Hatch 3.
[86:36.59]Is this a save?
[86:44.10]Save for the love of fuck, I know.
[86:46.00]Hopefully, is there a... Save point.
[86:49.84]Run.
[86:51.89]We did it.
[87:00.06]No save run?
[87:01.08]You gotta be kidding me.
[87:02.82]I would never in a million years do something like that.
[87:10.20]Is this the streamer that was supposed to die today?
[87:12.32]I protected myself.
[87:15.87]I got duct tape.
[87:17.55]Got some padding.
[87:19.75]I was good to go.
[87:23.17]Alright.
[87:25.45]Where do I go now?
[87:27.15]Hatch 3.
[87:28.25]No.
[87:28.69]How do I exit?
[87:34.21]Speedrun is no safe.
[87:50.45]So we got hatch 6.
[88:04.76]Can I talk yet?
[88:05.44]This is another scenario where I'm gonna get hit one time and die.
[88:13.46]Is there anything else to do?
[88:16.06]Hatch 6.
[88:18.40]Run.
[88:20.72]How's Las Vegas?
[88:21.45]It's great.
[88:22.95]Vegas is a great place.
[88:29.53]Did you finish the Star Wars spoiler yet?
[88:33.48]Yeah, you can unmute.
[88:35.52]You're good.
[88:41.18]I'm not gonna pee.
[88:45.57]I'm just gonna pee now.
[88:46.29]I'll be right back.
[88:49.09]Just gonna go pee.
[91:21.29]Alright, let's finish this thing.
[91:23.93]Alright.
[91:36.96]That was a long pee.
[91:38.84]Yeah, I've been holding it.
[91:42.90]I had to pee since we first got to that spot.
[91:47.07]So.
[91:48.87]You know.
[91:54.11]Since we first got to the spot from last night, I've had to go to the bathroom.
[91:57.01]Run.
[91:57.09]Did I save it?
[91:57.51]I did, right?
[91:59.94]Yeah.
[92:29.06]It's full of stones, isn't it?
[92:35.67]Yeah, I did.
[92:36.75]I saved.
[92:37.83]I did, right?
[92:38.31]It's all phony philosopher's stones.
[93:14.29]What can we do?
[93:23.40]Don't breathe.
[93:24.00]Philosopher's Stone dust.
[93:25.04]Don't breathe this.
[93:30.14]I got bored.
[93:30.86]What am I doing?
[93:31.30]The station should have a self-destruct system.
[93:37.06]We'll blow up the station and these stones before they can be used on Earth.
[93:42.77]Okay.
[93:43.05]Wait for me.
[93:43.49]I'll be right there.
[93:51.63]Credits.
[93:54.83]There's more to do.
[94:02.92]This is it.
[94:05.36]The monitor room.
[94:08.19]There's no mistake.
[94:10.05]I finally made it.
[94:12.39]Am I in there?
[94:12.97]Oh, this is me.
[94:15.61]This is a big reveal.
[94:20.09]Am I the final boss?
[94:21.23]Sure can.
[94:22.11]Yep.
[94:22.31]I don't like the way that she's talking here.
[94:49.62]This is like when the vampire comes to your front door and pretends to be like a door-to-door vacuum salesman.
[94:59.21]Who's this?
[95:14.51]Why so surprised, Rio?
[95:16.63]Was it not you who taught me that if we die near the stone, it'll bring us back to life?
[95:29.96]Joe Craft is back.
[95:33.82]Haven't you realized it yet?
[95:36.38]Don't you get it?
[95:37.34]You became a monster long ago.
[95:45.40]You liar!
[95:46.86]Believe me, I will save you.
[95:48.92]You too!
[95:52.51]You'll become dust here!
[95:59.41]Become dust?
[96:01.19]The only thing that's becoming dust is you!
[96:14.46]Uh-oh.
[96:15.52]They're all gonna get attached to him and he's gonna turn into a giant alien.
[96:18.10]How dare you, you bloody whore!
[96:21.46]Bitch, you're dead!
[96:23.00]Gonna crush the life out of you!
[96:26.37]Not getting away!
[96:27.45]Not getting away with this!
[96:30.21]Whoa!
[96:42.65]No, that's a whole monster.
[96:45.43]That's nuts.
[96:47.81]I really don't think it's as easy as just shooting a rocket in the mouth or something stupid.
[97:12.00]Okay, you've got an idea.
[97:23.79]Jens, let's get out of it.
[97:24.53]Let's go in an escape pod, press the button and blow the place up.
[97:32.28]Thank God I saved it.
[97:33.26]Because this is another one of those unbearable full cutscenes I can't skip.
[97:38.26]This is not even going to be...
[97:41.33]This is the very end of the game.
[97:43.43]There's gonna be one little gimmick that I gotta do to take out the monster and then we leave.
[97:49.27]That's it.
[97:54.47]There he is.
[97:57.26]Super crab.
[97:59.26]Engine's power on full.
[98:11.28]This is it.
[98:13.08]Our last stand.
[98:15.32]Head wink.
[98:15.92]Time to settle things.
[98:18.82]Alright.
[98:19.24]Thrusters full.
[98:25.22]Wasn't I supposed to get up too?
[98:26.28]Like you've always done.
[98:27.92]I want you to give me instructions.
[98:31.15]It's okay.
[98:32.19]Don't worry.
[98:32.71]So I don't get to get out.
[98:33.71]I'll destroy that thing soon then go get you.
[98:39.17]Alright.
[98:42.34]Okay.
[98:44.88]This is gonna get bigger.
[98:57.91]This motherfucker just leveled up.
[99:02.17]Again.
[99:02.52]Twice.
[99:03.08]Again?
[99:09.28]Alright, I think we have to...
[99:12.78]Where are the health bars?
[99:16.24]Operator, let's go!
[99:19.04]Full power!
[99:22.62]Use the left thruster to attack.
[99:26.83]Where should I aim?
[99:28.25]Tell me up, down, left, right, OK?
[99:30.07]The enemy has been spotted.
[99:37.79]Right.
[99:38.27]Right.
[99:40.17]Left.
[99:41.45]Left.
[99:41.67]Left.

[99:54.73]Left.
[99:56.75]Up.
[99:58.05]Right.
[99:58.37]It's no good, Operator.
[100:00.49]It's not working at all.
[100:01.63]I need the... I can't control the other one.
[100:07.31]Look, Operator.
[100:08.43]It's materialized.
[100:09.87]There's our chance.
[100:24.03]Right Down Up Left Left Left thruster
[100:38.81]Right.

[101:41.27]Left.
[101:42.57]Left.
[101:43.63]Left.
[101:45.49]Dude, okay, the reason why this is horrendous is because I have to use left stick to move mine.
[101:52.44]I have to hold circle, tell her a command, and then let go of circle.
[101:59.58]Every time.
[102:05.84]Left.
[102:06.90]Down.

[104:01.62]How do you get that wrong?
[104:07.00]Right.
[104:08.52]Down.
[104:16.02]Left.
[104:17.16]Left.
[104:19.22]Where's the damage?
[104:20.04]What?
[104:23.06]Right.
[104:24.20]Down.
[104:25.82]Up.
[104:26.82]Left.

[105:48.02]Down.
[105:48.93]Right.
[106:00.57]What a fucking mess.
[106:04.03]What a fucking mess of an encounter.
[106:17.20]So you got these two thrusters, which, by the way, block the whole screen.
[106:23.54]So when he spawns the stupid fucking undersea mines, half of them you can't even see where they are.
[106:32.25]Oh, by the way, I'm gonna complain about that.
[106:40.33]What a piece of fucking crap.
[106:44.18]Can't wait to watch the four and a half full minutes of cutscenes.
[106:50.72]Exit.
[107:27.09]Hatch six.
[107:28.26]Hatch six.
[107:29.44]OK.
[107:34.49]Left.
[107:35.25]Left.
[107:35.95]Left.
[107:36.53]Left.
[107:37.21]Up.

[107:39.21]Left.
[107:39.80]Right.
[108:06.12]Go.
[108:06.42]Can we hurry the fuck up here?
[108:09.94]Fast.
[108:10.70]Quickly.
[108:11.56]Okay.
[108:11.74]It doesn't do anything.
[108:12.28]You just have to float.
[108:14.32]I just have to float to the fucking cutscenes.
[108:16.61]These better be skippable.
[108:18.75]You're gonna watch me fucking have a real meltdown.
[108:22.13]Thank fucking god.
[108:23.29]This is it.
[108:33.99]The monitor room.
[108:36.84]There's no mistake.
[108:38.68]I finally made it.
[108:41.51]You're inside of here.
[108:49.01]Hi.
[108:50.63]Can you see me?
[108:52.31]Yes.
[108:54.79]We can finally meet.
[108:56.09]Yes, yeah, just keep talking.
[108:58.43]Is it alright if I come in?
[109:00.15]Just play the cutscene.
[109:01.63]Huh?
[109:02.91]What?
[109:04.47]I couldn't quite catch that.
[109:07.52]I'm gonna get it the second this pops up.
[109:11.46]Watch this.
[109:11.80]Here we go.
[109:13.35]I'm so fucking glad you can skip that shit.
[109:35.57]Put them to the end of the game to figure it out.
[109:42.43]Alright, I'm gonna get it this time.
[109:44.11]Because now I didn't even know I could control it.
[109:46.87]The whole game you can't control- I'm not gonna talk.
[109:48.57]Left.
[110:07.03]Right.
[110:14.13]Bottom right, top left.
[110:28.74]Alright, let's go.
[110:34.24]Get rid of the barrier!
[110:37.73]Bottom right.
[110:46.69]Top left.
[110:48.73]Left, up.
[110:51.35]Right, up.
[111:07.24]Down.
[111:09.24]Up.
[111:11.10]Up.
[111:12.40]Oh my fucking god, I hate this game.
[111:21.60]Left.
[111:21.90]Up.
[111:40.76]Left.
[111:43.52]Up.
[111:45.42]Up.
[111:46.66]Up.
[111:48.04]Up.
[111:49.46]Up.
[111:51.22]What the fuck is going on?
[111:54.90]Up.
[111:56.12]Up left.
[111:57.90]What the fuck are you doing?
[111:59.40]Top right.
[112:00.98]Up right.
[112:04.05]Left.
[112:05.75]I can't even fucking believe it.
[112:12.21]Left.
[112:13.39]Down.
[112:15.15]Right.
[112:17.39]Right.
[112:18.97]She doesn't understand the word right now!
[112:23.44]I'm watching a fucking YouTube video at the end of this game.
[112:25.98]This is dumb.
[112:27.14]This is D-U-M-B.
[112:31.04]Dumb.
[112:45.38]Lower right.
[112:47.22]Right.
[112:48.66]Right.
[112:50.22]Right.
[112:51.79]Down.
[112:56.45]Adjust the mic.
[112:57.07]There is no adjusting the mic.
[112:58.69]It doesn't exist.
[112:59.39]It's not a feature.
[113:01.84]There's no feature to adjust the mic.
[113:13.09]You can check the mic and she goes, I can hear you.
[113:16.17]I can hear you just fine.
[113:18.53]We did it last night.
[113:23.22]I have to start it over.
[113:24.28]Piece of fucking crap.
[113:40.33]This is the last encounter of the game.
[113:47.00]Why did I reset it?
[113:47.84]Because... Last time I reset it... Remember when she was just sitting on the ground last night and wouldn't listen to anything?
[114:11.67]Your mic's not on my... It hasn't moved!
[114:18.82]No!
[114:19.30]Don't do a new game!
[114:21.26]I tried to... That made some noise.
[115:18.80]I'm not going to have a corrupted save file.
[115:20.60]I mean, I did the thing you're never supposed to do.
[115:23.99]We'll just turn off the... We're fine.
[115:31.29]Move the mic away from your... This is where it's been the whole time.
[115:36.24]The game says keep it very close.
[115:40.36]It's obviously not a problem because when I was saying left, it would go left.
[115:45.16]Microphone check.
[115:47.63]Your voice that's coming over the microphone.
[115:51.77]Your voice is easy to distinguish.
[115:53.85]I like your voice.
[116:01.88]Those of you that are wondering, that's the microphone calibration in the game.
[116:06.40]It's just, can I hear you?
[116:08.40]Yes or no.
[116:11.00]That's it.
[116:12.30]Mic works.
[116:15.78]Leave.
[116:17.77]Leave.
[116:18.03]Hallway.
[116:18.83]Okay, I'll leave.
[116:40.69]And I gotta watch her float around.
[116:46.06]Jerva's hair looks like candy floss.
[116:50.72]Banned.
[116:55.71]Fast.
[116:56.69]It's because I had a helmet on.
[117:18.40]If I can't get her to move in the directions that I say at least a 50 percentile, 60 percentile, I'm putting a video of the end of the game on the screen.
[117:46.33]You wouldn't.
[117:48.94]I wouldn't, but I would today.
[117:54.79]The foam on the wall is doing something.
[117:59.61]You keep trying to fast forward the stream.

[122:39.51]She's coming in for a hug.
[122:42.85]What do I do?
[122:43.27]What do I do?

[127:17.43]Why did I say life?

[134:19.24]Stop saying life.
[134:20.89]Good luck.
[134:21.39]Oh no!
[134:48.32]Is that me?
[135:04.69]This ending is just a white screen.
[135:07.81]Is that me?
[135:10.39]Are we gonna get a face reveal?
[135:19.29]I got a hand reveal.
[135:20.91]Does she live inside me now?
[136:09.69]We made it.
[136:11.45]Back to Earth we go.
[136:12.39]And I'll pronounce you man and wife, right?
[136:23.86]Listen, operator.
[136:28.82]Can I say one last thing?
[136:34.48]Thank you.
[136:37.91]You know, I was thinking we don't show the face.
[136:40.88]Because it could be anyone.
[136:43.74]Leave it up to the viewer and the moviegoer to dissect and figure out who that could actually be.
[136:49.92]Is it them?
[136:52.78]Or was it somebody else entirely different?
[136:59.37]Because obviously it's not you.
[137:01.73]Because it's not from a first-person perspective.
[137:05.64]But who is that mysterious figure?
[137:11.02]It wasn't us.
[137:11.84]We're in space right now floating around.
[137:14.45]That was not even the operator.
[137:16.99]That was some random fucking guy that just happened to still be alive as a guest in the hotel.
[137:23.27]I'm still the perspective.
[137:24.89]We're floating around in space.
[137:25.87]We die.
[137:35.55]There it is.
[137:42.23]Alright, final thoughts on Lifeline.
[137:48.19]Bad.
[137:48.84]Awful.
[137:49.40]Not good.
[137:50.48]Why did I stream that for fucking like 16 straight hours almost?
[137:54.78]Worst thing I've ever done in my life.
[137:56.10]Worst thing I've ever done in my adult life.
[137:58.64]And... It was a very fun experience.
[138:02.02]It was a very good game.
[138:04.71]Now, all jokes aside, it was really cool, really fun.
[138:07.09]Except for the portions where she didn't really listen to you.
[138:10.05]And how broken sometimes it was.
[138:11.59]And the unskippable cutscenes.
[138:14.71]I'm not going to give it a letter grade, but I'm going to tell you right now, if you have a PlayStation 2, make sure you have the one or two specific headsets that will even work with the game.
[138:24.08]Because you can't just plug in anything.
[138:26.88]It has to be a very specific headset.
[138:30.86]Who's going to buy this?
[138:35.41]I'm acting like this is a game that's on Steam right now.
[138:42.23]You can't just go get this.
[138:48.83]That was a fun experience.
[138:49.87]That was a good... That was a fun... No, no, no.
[138:51.30]Hold on.
[138:51.54]Let's rephrase that.
[138:52.10]That was a good stream.
[138:53.32]That was a fun... Super stream.
[138:57.82]Was it... 12, 13, 14... About... Like 15 hours or so?
[138:59.48]In the last 24 hours?
[139:07.67]Look, sometimes we play these fucked up weird games.
[139:11.51]This stream doesn't happen unless this game exists.
[139:14.91]It was great.
[139:23.43]So... The purpose of today's stream... Last night, because we went so late into the morning... If you weren't around yesterday... I...
[139:37.48]Streamed until like 3 or 4 a.m.
[139:39.26]Pacific.
[139:41.87]So I didn't get a whole lot of sleep.
[139:45.57]And obviously I wanted to get up and do the IRL stream.
[139:50.17]So what we're going to do... And I want to finish this game, obviously, too.
[139:53.19]Because we just kept it going from yesterday.
[139:54.98]Or this morning.
[140:02.16]End of the stream.
[140:03.70]Yeah.
[140:05.58]So, last night, there was a ton of bits, and there was a lot of messages, and I didn't do any of them, because the stream was so late into the morning, that what we're gonna do right now, we're gonna just kind of relax, we're gonna just hang out, gonna go over the bits from yesterday, and do the, obviously, the bits from today, and just chill for a little while.
[140:36.66]And then the stream will end.
[140:42.08]And on top of that, the next time you'll see me, which was today.
[140:44.42]Today is... Today is the 23rd, Wednesday.
[140:55.25]You will see me again on Friday and Saturday.
[140:59.19]And Friday and Saturday, we have a lot of random things we can do.
[141:02.07]There's tons of shit to do.
[141:05.51]That could be finally the day of Dreamcast.
[141:14.10]Because I have all the games, I have all the stuff.
[141:17.14]Or maybe, I don't know.
[141:19.16]It really depends on what I feel like doing.
[141:22.32]So you'll see me again on Friday if you take it off.
[141:25.15]Thank you for, if you were here yesterday too, thank you for joining me on this weird schedule here.
[141:36.65]stream part one yesterday into today stream part two today also so have a good rest of your night I'll see you guys on Friday and let's do the bits and I'm gonna just kind of I'm gonna just like hang out here I gotta save the game
[142:06.94]Dragon's Dogma?
[142:07.90]That's also definitely something to do.
[142:09.57]I'm probably going to go Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[142:12.31]This weekend.
[142:13.65]Just because I've been kind of all over the place with streams.
[142:16.13]I missed... I pushed a stream back because I wasn't feeling that great last week, so... I don't see why I wouldn't be able to do it.
[142:23.59]Unless something else comes up, which I don't think it will.
[142:31.00]Open save.
[142:31.84]There's an Easter egg.
[142:35.00]Okay.
[142:35.12]Okay.
[142:38.07]So let's go through the bits from today.
[142:39.33]Actually, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[142:43.04]That's probably not a good idea.
[142:47.32]Because some might trickle in over the next little while.
[142:53.02]Complete data.
[143:03.97]I need to open that bits website.
[143:08.46]It's the Jerm of mustard one.
[143:09.58]I have that in my favorites, don't I?
[143:11.30]What the hell is it?
[143:18.23]Why do I not have it?
[143:20.91]In 16th century Europe, there lived a physician by the name of... Let's go.
[143:32.67]So what's the Easter egg?
[143:33.31]This is the security room.
[143:34.47]Come in, please.
[143:38.36]For a start.
[143:40.40]What's the Easter egg?
[143:41.04]Oh, she's in a different costume.
[143:42.88]New costume.
[143:45.16]One glove.
[143:48.40]Ah!
[143:48.54]Ah!
[144:06.11]Huh.
[144:07.13]What's with the casual attitude?
[144:08.77]Sexy pose.
[144:10.21]You don't sound like the regular guy.
[144:14.37]You don't sound like the regular guy.
[144:17.68]Listen, will you please undo the lock?
[144:21.90]Uh, so we saw that.
[144:23.20]Looks good.
[144:26.88]Let me just, um, go on queuing this up.
[144:28.82]Please disengage the lock on this door.
[144:31.48]So this is...
[144:37.18]Where are we at here?
[144:41.52]If you operate the door panel, it will open the door.
[144:44.75]Operate.
[144:45.07]Alright, here.
[144:46.33]Let her out.
[144:46.97]Let her out.
[144:51.31]The lock is open.
[144:53.57]OK.
[144:54.89]So we got to do maximum time.
[144:57.47]A redhead cage security guard locked me up in there for over an hour.
[145:00.83]Jeez.
[145:02.74]I didn't know what was going to happen.
[145:08.98]So, what's your story?
[145:09.84]Oh, this is the wrong timeline.
[145:11.12]Are you trapped inside that monitor room?
[145:13.60]So, we share the same dilemma.
[145:17.00]And now... Sexy pose.
[145:19.76]Don't worry, I'll try it.
[145:23.38]I will try.
[145:24.14]Okay.
[145:30.79]So, I have the bits from yesterday.
[145:33.55]It's not in here.
[145:46.49]It's not, I'm not saying that, show that.
[145:49.69]We already know what that, it's just bullshit.
[145:58.12]Alright, we're not even gonna, it doesn't even matter.
[146:05.38]We're just gonna do the bits while we hang out here.
[146:07.60]This is from yesterday, by the way.
[146:09.00]So we're gonna go through them in a fairly timely manner, but I want to make sure I cover most of them.
[146:18.12]Thank you, Peter, P327R, for the $25 yesterday.
[146:22.15]Fat Busiant, thanks for the $1.
[146:25.81]Sad Vega, thanks for the $1.
[146:28.79]It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
[146:30.39]It was the age of wisdom, the age of foolishness.
[146:32.68]It was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incurability.
[146:35.60]It was the season of light, the season of darkness.
[146:38.22]It was the spring of hope.
[146:39.62]This is just a whole paragraph.
[146:41.04]Look, I'm in a bit of a hurry.
[146:41.92]Just wait there to be rescued.
[146:44.25]Okay, thank you Bake Me Home for the $1.
[146:46.41]Tingy for the $1, no message.
[146:48.69]Uh, thank you Itrasgara for the $1.
[146:50.39]End of the screamer voice.
[146:53.17]Did this happen in the other game?
[146:54.45]I don't remember this happening.
[147:03.22]Oh, it did happen, right.
[147:05.70]Uh, Meme Machines, thanks for the $1.
[147:07.60]Mr. Kasadin, thanks for the $1.
[147:09.30]Can I have your Gamer V Portable when you die?
[147:15.34]No.
[147:16.62]That's coming with bears.
[147:18.48]I'm gonna get buried.
[147:19.22]Right eye, middle eye, left eye.
[147:21.86]Right eye, middle eye, left eye.
[147:28.10]Left eye.
[147:29.52]Left eye.
[147:31.64]Dodge left.
[147:32.92]I can't play this right now.
[147:38.01]I can't play this and I can't talk, game, and read bits.
[147:41.73]It's just not gonna happen.
[147:45.50]So here's what we're gonna do.
[147:46.22]I'm just gonna go on the camera.
[147:51.62]Like this.
[147:53.50]Get this thing off.
[147:58.06]Go over there.
[148:02.76]Okay.
[148:05.81]God, that helmet.
[148:06.91]Look what that helmet did to me.
[148:09.15]It just fucked me up so bad.
[148:10.35]Okay.
[148:13.65]Okay.
[148:17.07]I'm just, like, weird guy in the middle of the screen, but that's okay.
[148:22.11]So, let's go back to what we were doing.
[148:29.62]Shave.
[148:32.28]I shaved, like, two days ago.
[148:34.60]I shaved, like, every three or four days.
[148:37.10]Mr. Kassadin, thanks for the one dollar.
[148:39.47]Divas, thank you Divas for the $2.
[148:41.39]AM Clockwork, thanks for $5.
[148:45.05]Agent Pigeon, thanks for $1.
[148:47.47]Sorry I'm not richer, but I just want to say thank you for being there for me without knowing it.
[148:51.94]Also, sorry about your death tomorrow.
[148:57.12]Today is tomorrow.
[148:59.26]Today's tomorrow and I'm just fine.
[149:00.69]I'm still here.
[149:02.82]Uh, the only guy ever thanks to the $1 Jerma friend.
[149:05.77]I would greatly appreciate if you could treat chat to your humorous reading of this post from your subreddit.
[149:19.96]I was working at a McDonald's drive-thru in Las Vegas.
[149:38.17]I just like stretched my, whatever.
[149:41.10]Uh, I was working the night shift at McDonald's when the first customer in hours pulled up to the window as my headphones sputtered to life.
[149:48.56]Hey, idiot.
[149:50.54]See, I've been dealing with anxiety issues for a while, mainly because I'm fresh out of college and I'm stuck working the graveyard at a fast food joint.
[149:56.84]So this actually hit me pretty hard.
[149:58.22]This didn't happen.
[149:59.90]But alas, the customer is always right, so I had to power through it.
[150:02.83]Welcome to McDonald's.
[150:03.65]What can I get you?
[150:04.31]I said with corporate forced joy.
[150:07.15]Yeah, can I get a whopper, dummy?
[150:10.07]I was taken aback, not just by his rudeness, but by the slurring of words.
[150:13.44]I can tell that he was either intoxicated or had a New Eastern, New England accent.
[150:19.86]Excuse me, sir, but we don't have those here, but can I interest you in a Big Mac?
[150:23.63]Shut up, doofus.
[150:24.35]Say something funny already, clown.
[150:27.75]At this point, there were tears streaming down my cheeks from the barrage of insults.
[150:31.81]And it felt worse when I heard the laughing of another man in the car, as well as a synthesized noise coming from some sort of instrument.
[150:39.56]I couldn't handle it anymore in my current state, being I just got out of... Yeah, this is like a whopper fucking chat.
[150:48.73]This is a chat thing.
[150:50.25]Why are you turning this on me?
[151:00.89]So I had just missed my mother's funeral.
[151:07.91]So I snapped.
[151:09.49]Hey, I've had enough of this.
[151:10.48]Can you just go asshole?
[151:13.04]As a response to this, I heard boisterous laughter coming from the two men and the sounds of my manager coming down the hall to talk to me.
[151:20.52]He shoved me and took my headset and told me to go to the second window and get ready to give them their order.
[151:25.57]I apologized for him.
[151:26.55]May I take your order?
[151:28.33]After a minute or two, an order appeared on the screen.
[151:32.07]Two small coffees, two 10-piece chicken wings, four limited edition Cheeto sauces.
[151:39.10]I prepared their order and waited in the window and looked down to the drive to take a look at their car.
[151:45.08]What I saw was a car smaller than a Volkswagen Beetle painted white with red, blue, green, and yellow spots all over it, and the words Jerma985 emblazoned in fluorescent purple across the hood.
[151:57.01]Swerving down the road, hitting the wall multiple times in a 10-foot journey to the window.
[152:08.38]How long is this?
[152:09.44]This is like a whole story.
[152:14.60]The one driving appeared to be an older man and was flushed red.
[152:19.18]Hold...
[152:44.01]I didn't do this!
[152:44.87]This is a copypasta!
[152:47.99]This is a copyposto!
[152:51.58]Hey loser, the short man slurred as the passenger giggled and played the instrument.
[152:55.90]The driver elbowed him and said, Hey, was that a good one, Sheeto?
[152:59.74]A real LOL moment, huh?
[153:01.27]And the automaton played some high notes, seemingly meant to signify a chortle.
[153:05.99]He finally actually looked at me and saw my distraught state and shrieked with laughter.
[153:10.35]At this point I couldn't look at them and I turned away sobbing, holding out the drink tray with their coffee and the brown paper sack containing their Cheetos and chicken.
[153:18.56]The older looking man had to jump out of his seat to grab and snatch the goods from my tear-stained hands.
[153:24.49]I was still for a while until I heard their car finally drive off, and when I finally looked forward once more, I could make out a small card left on the counter in front of me.
[153:34.60]Through my tear-clouded vision, I took the slip of paper and locked myself in the bathroom to cry.
[153:40.76]In about an hour, the emotion had passed, and my sight was clear again, so I looked at the card.
[153:45.18]Subscribe to Jerma985 on Twitch.
[153:57.26]I didn't do this.
[153:57.92]I didn't make this.
[154:00.87]But if you want to read it, I did not make this.
[154:02.97]I did not do that.
[154:06.05]That was a... Somebody made a reference to the stream from a couple days ago where I was talking about how chat was ordering me to do things and calling me names.
[154:15.82]So... That's where that came from.
[154:19.84]I didn't do any of that.
[154:20.82]I would never do something like that.
[154:24.88]Dummy.
[154:35.08]But thank you, TheOnlyGuy.
[154:35.86]Thank you, PlasticGlue, for the $1.
[154:37.29]Thank you, AceJealous, for the $1.
[154:38.85]The $10 is actually from last night.
[154:41.25]I've been watching your videos for over eight years.
[154:43.37]Thanks for all the great times.
[154:44.71]I know you don't usually watch videos on stream, but find time to watch this one.
[154:51.56]Find time to watch this one.
[154:55.24]Let's see.
[155:01.05]Did we watch this one?
[155:07.03]I think we watched the, this is like the reunion, Jerma star reunion, right?
[155:10.91]I think we already, I think we watched this already.
[155:15.94]No, it's not, there's no gnome here.
[155:22.26]There you go.
[155:24.44]Yeah, it's very touching.
[155:28.52]I'm pretty sure we watched that a while ago.
[155:33.24]But thank you for it, nonetheless.
[155:36.18]Check it out.
[155:38.90]15 minutes until death.
[155:40.23]No, no, that was Eastern time.
[155:41.73]We already did it.
[155:45.95]If it's a gnome, I unset.
[155:47.29]It's not a gnome.
[155:54.37]I don't want to be mean, and maybe it's just some weird lighting, but you look like a corpse right now.
[156:02.04]I think it's... It's the... It's...
[156:19.17]I don't understand why that would be.
[156:20.31]I feel fucking fine.
[156:29.12]I'm gonna change this.
[156:33.07]You look like a corpse.
[156:36.11]I don't... I don't understand.
[156:40.23]Somebody's linked a clip.
[156:43.89]I don't know what it is.
[156:45.30]Should I click this?
[156:45.84]Am I gonna get in trouble if I click this?
[156:50.18]Yeah, it's the white balance.
[156:52.20]Here.
[156:56.83]What the fuck is going on?
[157:05.63]Um... Okay.
[157:25.88]The webcam is broken.
[157:29.26]Why did that happen?
[157:32.46]What?
[157:34.86]I clicked on white balance and the thing cracked.
[157:37.55]Fucking Logitech, man.
[157:44.99]Here comes a joke.
[157:45.83]There's no joke.
[157:50.83]I don't have a joke.
[157:53.22]I actually have to unplug the webcam and plug it back in.
[158:02.23]Let's see if that fixes it.
[158:10.42]I'm going to change this to just hanging out for a little bit.
[158:21.08]And put it on just chatting, right?
[158:24.12]Because that's what we're doing.
[158:25.24]Alright.
[158:31.68]Can this work, please?
[158:37.47]Add camera.
[158:42.31]There it is.
[158:43.45]What the fuck is wrong with this thing?
[158:54.66]Dude, I have no idea what's going on.
[159:00.50]This thing sucks.
[159:18.37]It made the resolution even worse.
[159:22.85]Some insane way.
[159:29.12]I couldn't tell you why this is happening.
[159:36.87]Zoom in on your ear.
[159:39.47]Why?
[159:41.53]Now I'm desynced.
[159:42.61]Yeah.
[159:49.25]Fucking computers, man.
[159:50.21]That should be... We should be good.
[159:54.43]At least we should be.
[159:55.66]I've been wrong before.
[160:00.77]Fixed.
[160:01.67]Good.
[160:03.15]And why is the resolution like an 800x600?
[160:06.49]Where's the 16x9?
[160:10.62]Don't ever buy a computer.
[160:12.58]Just like fucking read a book.
[160:14.34]Seriously, just read a book.
[160:18.28]Just read a book.
[160:22.66]But anyways, thank you to Novi333 for the $3.33.
[160:28.78]Since you blatantly ignored my bits last stream, I'll say it again.
[160:31.72]You must play Seaman for the Dreamcast.
[160:33.64]Already bought it.
[160:34.22]It's already here.
[160:35.68]So don't worry.
[160:36.14]You will see it very soon.
[160:39.74]I did purchase Seaman and the mic.
[160:43.37]Talked about how expensive it was.
[160:44.61]It was an incredibly stupidly expensive piece of product.
[160:49.45]And it's here.
[160:53.85]Dreamcast is back there, all the games, actually the games are downstairs.
[160:56.64]Look at this fucking hair, worst hair of fucking 2020.
[161:01.00]But, thank you nonetheless, really appreciate it.
[161:06.40]It's fake.
[161:08.46]It's not fake.
[161:11.88]It's not fake.
[161:13.60]But, thank you Novi, thank you DemFay for the $1.
[161:15.88]Hey Jerma, my boyfriend is a big fan, but I wanted to let you know that every time I watch your streams or videos, I have the strong urge to vomit.
[161:28.24]Thanks for the $1.
[161:31.88]Thank you.
[161:34.79]Thank you, SexyCowleg, for the $4.
[161:38.11]DemFay for the $4.
[161:40.53]Again.
[161:41.65]I actually puked to your green screen stream.
[161:43.90]I got pretty bad motion sickness and I was drunk.
[161:45.64]I just thought you'd know.
[161:59.49]You didn't puke on the green screen stream.
[162:01.82]You did not.
[162:04.82]Why would you... How would you get motion sickness on a... There was no first person stuff.
[162:13.34]I did.
[162:13.68]I did.
[162:13.90]You didn't puke.
[162:15.56]Nobody puked.
[162:17.06]None of you puked.
[162:18.10]I can guarantee that.
[162:19.56]But thank you for the $4.
[162:21.17]Thank you to Demonic Cucumber for the $1.
[162:24.27]It's a clip.
[162:24.71]Let's go ahead and click it and see what it is.
[162:26.05]If it's a snort, I'm turning the stream off.
[162:33.10]I'm not gonna grab it.
[162:34.34]I'm reaching for the fucking coconut that's up there.
[162:36.10]I'm not reaching for the banana.
[162:46.27]What?
[162:46.47]I don't get it.
[162:50.85]What happened?
[162:52.71]They said Jerma furry.
[162:58.41]Gabe DeGrossi, thanks for the $4.
[163:01.53]Not a lot, but I hope to join streams as often as I used to, man.
[163:04.39]Good to see you still.
[163:05.25]Good to see you still are community-based.
[163:09.80]I love it.
[163:11.64]Man, why not?
[163:13.38]Why not?
[163:17.09]Of course I'll be community-based.
[163:18.25]It's the whole reason why the stream exists.
[163:22.92]So, thank you.
[163:24.64]Thanks for being in the community.
[163:25.68]Thank you, Gabe DeGrossi, for turning into Glue Man all those years ago.
[163:30.86]And thanks for the $4.
[163:33.56]Certainly not Tom.
[163:36.02]Thank you for the $10.
[163:36.94]Certainly not Tom.
[163:37.62]Jeremiah, I had a dream that you were a teacher and tried to give me detention, but then the rest of the class bullied you and made fun of the things you said until you stopped.
[163:45.58]And I think that was a metaphor for chat in my dream.
[163:50.54]Okay, good.
[163:51.24]Speed buy.
[163:53.44]Other than that, you're an incredible streamer and I wanted to show my support.
[163:58.67]Well... Chat can be a little wild sometimes.
[164:08.27]But 99.9% of the time, they're great.
[164:09.67]But there's a 0.01% of the time that they're very, very mean to me.
[164:24.28]And it makes me say, what the heck?
[164:30.37]It's definitely more than 0.01%.
[164:33.07]It's like 40.
[164:33.97]No, I'm kidding.
[164:36.19]Somebody in chat wrote that and I was just making it.
[164:38.49]You guys are amazing.
[164:39.21]Don't worry.
[164:40.72]Thank you for the funny dream.
[164:43.36]That seems like a fucked up dream.
[164:47.80]We suck.
[164:48.88]No, you don't.
[164:49.96]Don't say that.
[164:51.04]You don't.
[164:52.27]Hey, Pin, thanks for the $1.
[164:53.63]Fucking go to the wicked room, dude.
[164:56.61]You're making fun of my Boston accent that I don't even have.
[164:58.75]Listen, this is not a Boston accent.
[165:01.86]This is a... I just got a regular accent.
[165:05.34]There's no Boston here.
[165:08.90]Hey, YDNA, thanks for the... $10.
[165:10.18]$10 from YDNA.
[165:13.58]Hey, Jeremy, we've been watching you for two plus years.
[165:17.38]Just want to say that you're literally my favorite content creator ever.
[165:19.76]Thank you for all that you do.
[165:21.91]Thank you, that means a lot.
[165:24.39]Thank you so much.
[165:26.19]Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[165:34.05]Floored by the amount of money and the amount of support people give this channel.
[165:38.21]There's not much else I can say besides thank you so fucking much.
[165:41.82]That's fucking incredible.
[165:46.04]I have trouble with this because I can't believe it sometimes.
[165:52.18]Thank you, all of you.
[165:55.22]Thank you, Effectator.
[165:56.62]Thank you, Effectator, for the $5.
[165:59.40]According to your bio ink redemption stream, you're set to die tomorrow, which is today, which also is me and my partner's anniversary.
[166:07.11]Can our present be that you don't die?
[166:09.43]I need editing jobs to pay for food.
[166:16.01]Here I am.
[166:20.32]Still here.
[166:24.21]Nothing even happened.
[166:24.91]That's fine.
[166:27.02]Thank you, Chess Master, for the one dollar.
[166:29.58]Friendly reminder that you're due to die tomorrow.
[166:31.36]A lot of people harping on that fact.
[166:35.47]I don't even know where that came from.
[166:36.53]Some video game or something.
[166:39.33]Thank you, Drummage Door, for the $1.
[166:41.39]Thanks for introducing me to Viscera Cleanup Detail.
[166:43.93]I've almost done all the levels with over 95% completion.
[166:47.29]What a simple but fun game.
[166:48.53]Are you going to stream it more?
[166:49.93]Greetings from Finland.
[166:51.83]P.S.
[166:52.17]Try to pronounce... I don't know how to pronounce the Asians.
[166:56.61]I don't know why I could be saying anything.
[166:58.79]But thank you so much.
[167:00.80]And yeah, Viscera is awesome.
[167:04.53]Viscera is a really, really, really, really fun game.
[167:07.11]Really, really interesting.
[167:08.45]Really, really chill.
[167:10.25]And of course, I would love to play it again.
[167:11.59]Next time, I think I want to bring a troop in there.
[167:15.65]I want to bring some friends in there.
[167:18.35]And try to cause some fun.
[167:22.06]You know?
[167:23.86]It's a great game.
[167:26.72]Smellyboy, thanks for the $1.
[167:27.96]Creepypasta contest when?
[167:29.22]Um...
[167:35.22]That's not a bad idea.
[167:39.10]Creepypasta contest is like... Some of you guys are really, really creative.
[167:46.19]Judging by half the shit that was even on this stream at any given moment.
[167:50.83]Anything you guys say, half the shit you guys say, half the shit you do, it's like... There's a lot of fucking talented, fun, interesting people here that could probably come up with some really great stuff.
[168:02.40]Then Bugleberry reads them.
[168:11.48]That's true.
[168:13.04]742 Pacific?
[168:14.32]743 is... It's coming up.
[168:17.10]It's not going to matter, though, because it was Eastern.
[168:18.63]So, don't worry.
[168:22.85]But we'll see.
[168:23.39]Maybe.
[168:24.45]It's an interesting idea.
[168:26.91]Alec4x4, thanks for the $1.
[168:28.49]Hey, Jerma.
[168:29.59]I'm 15.
[168:30.53]Have $1,500.
[168:32.47]So far, from working at my job, is a gaming desktop a good investment?
[168:37.09]Well, that depends on what you mean by that.
[168:41.78]You don't have to spend $1500 to get a gaming PC.
[168:46.70]A gaming PC does not have to cost that much money.
[168:51.58]You could get something that's very capable.
[168:54.64]$743.
[168:56.31]Oh no!
[169:04.01]Happy New Year.
[169:06.51]You don't need a gamer PC.
[169:10.13]You just need a decent video card, a good amount of RAM, and a good, like, a decent CPU.
[169:15.08]You don't have to have top-of-the-line stuff to play games.
[169:19.76]You could probably get a decent gaming computer for, like, somewhere in between, like, $500 to $700.
[169:26.94]You could do it.
[169:28.78]Somewhere under $1,000, I think, is you could absolutely make it happen.
[169:34.10]And don't buy expensive shit just because it's expensive.
[169:37.44]Some of the stuff that you can buy is...
[169:40.25]Oh, yeah, but it's 10% faster than the latest and greatest, and it's two grand.
[169:45.81]That doesn't matter.
[169:46.35]700 to 900 is really all you need, somebody said.
[169:51.78]Yeah, that's really all you need.
[169:53.38]Unless you really are planning on doing something that requires a ton of power.
[170:00.73]Like if you're doing a lot of computations, heavy editing, heavy photo manipulation, heavy video manipulation, then of course you need a computer that can do it.
[170:10.32]But if you're just playing PC games and you don't care about playing at the ultra, ultra, ultra settings and you don't care about being on like just high and medium, then you're fine.
[170:24.57]don't need to like witcher 3 modded 4k textures with two c gpus and sli it's it's it's not necessary to just kind of play a game there are a lot of people that are in the Discord that are around that would probably love to talk to you about it so good luck and good and good luck on your uh on job too thanks a lot alec freudian weapon thanks for the one dollar you need to use your car salesman voice
[170:55.13]Sometimes I do.
[170:56.30]Breambin, thanks for the $10.
[170:57.46]Don't be mean to her.
[170:58.46]She's trying her best to pick up the half-eaten meal.
[171:02.84]No, she's... She was just... I could not even tolerate half the stuff that happened when she was doing things.
[171:15.43]No.
[171:17.55]I'm sorry.
[171:17.97]When it got to the point where she was reading numbers in the worst possible way to read a sequence of numbers, it's just like, come on.
[171:27.20]Come on.
[171:28.22]What am I supposed to do there?
[171:30.60]But thank you so much, Breenbin, for the $10.
[171:32.26]C4G, thanks for the $1.
[171:34.50]Shito... Shito be like... Like what?
[171:45.67]Birds be like... I just feel... I think I just... I think I'm... I feel like I just got gnomed.
[171:59.14]Thank you, TimmyTimTam, for the $1.
[172:00.82]The girl in this game talks like one of these videos.
[172:15.30]Sarah, you can't park here.
[172:16.90]It's a bus stop.
[172:18.04]Oh, we'll be back in a few minutes.
[172:19.42]It's okay.
[172:20.66]Oh, no, it isn't.
[172:21.56]You'll get a parking ticket if you leave it here.
[172:23.54]No, I won't.
[172:24.18]It's half past five.
[172:25.24]All the traffic wardens have gone home.
[172:27.46]Sarah.
[172:27.98]Yes?
[172:28.98]Is this your car, ma'am?
[172:31.50]Traffic rules.
[172:34.31]Left, right, left, right, left, right, right!
[172:35.89]Getting... What the fuck?
[173:08.48]hungry are you hungry panda say I love you autoplay uh played uh ancient for uh animal vines
[173:34.45]But thank you for that, TimmyTimTam.
[173:35.89]Thank you HackItFast for the $1.
[173:37.73]Thank you TheWombatFromHell for the $1.
[173:40.84]The 700,000 game stream gave me an idea.
[173:43.54]You should have chat play I Spy Spooky Mansion with the clicking extension.
[173:48.28]That game is actually good unlike those crappy stolen asset ones from the stream.
[173:54.12]We talked about that doing a hidden object chat plays hidden object game.
[174:02.35]That'd be pretty fun.
[174:03.99]I definitely want to do it.
[174:05.21]I'll look into it.
[174:07.29]You know, in quotes.
[174:09.05]That hair just got in my eye.
[174:21.62]Oh, yeah.
[174:22.02]I'm reading bits.
[174:22.70]Hey, thank you, Whole of One Zombie, for the $1.
[174:25.86]Donate dollar.
[174:26.70]Thank you.
[174:28.04]TechnoToast, thanks for the $1 Jerma.
[174:29.58]I love this meta stream you've got here where you get mad and shout commands at someone on screen.
[174:34.04]Great cosplay of chat.
[174:37.78]RC Martinez, thanks for the $1.
[174:39.30]Can I get a hi, hey, yeah in chat?
[174:45.37]Can you?
[174:50.27]And then this is where Broluck gave like the $700 trillion fucking dollars.
[174:56.50]Just seeing all these red symbols here.
[174:58.76]Red, red, red, red, red, red.
[175:02.58]And then rounded it off to a thousand.
[175:08.06]Jesus.
[175:10.06]Carlos the Clam also last night gave $24.
[175:13.02]I think we grabbed it, but they said the game could be beaten in under three hours.
[175:19.07]Which... There's no wasp in the room.
[175:25.67]That's ridiculous to me, that somebody could even let this... You must phonetically figure out exact mumbles to get the game to do what you want it to do.
[175:36.71]HackItFast, thanks for three bucks.
[175:39.23]No message, thank you.
[175:40.01]Mostly lost for the one dollar.
[175:41.05]Today we learned bribing Jerma to say something works, but it's because he's afraid of getting more money from you and feels bad.
[175:47.94]Yeah, we talked about it last night.
[175:49.44]Robbie Revolver, thanks for the one dollar.
[175:53.31]Thank you HackItFastAgain for the two bucks.
[175:55.49]Eat the whole ass or whatever.
[175:59.09]Thank you for the two bucks.
[176:01.53]Mostly Lost, thank you for $30.
[176:03.77]Don't make me do it.
[176:05.02]30 bucks for Mostly Lost.
[176:12.18]Thank you.
[176:13.80]Hey Pin, thanks for the $1.
[176:15.00]Just pretend there is a few more zeros on these bits.
[176:19.74]Pin, thanks for the fucking 10,000 bits, dude.
[176:24.15]Are you fucking kidding me?
[176:25.39]It's a lot of money.
[176:28.42]Was that good?
[176:30.16]Did I get the job?
[176:32.22]Hey, Grillmaster X barbecue.
[176:33.61]That's not right.
[176:34.25]That's Grillmaster BBX BB.
[176:36.47]It's Grillmax.
[176:38.33]Grillmaster BBQX.
[176:41.76]Pro tip of the day, next time you're looking for a tasty spin on the classic cheeseburger, try grilling your beef with the skin still on.
[176:48.16]It adds a unique furry texture that can spice up.
[176:50.93]Don't do that.
[176:52.05]Don't eat like that.
[176:53.05]Don't do that.
[176:54.13]It's a very bad idea.
[176:55.49]Don't ever do that.
[176:58.65]Eat officially licensed Nintendo brand.
[177:02.09]It doesn't have the Nintendo seal on it.
[177:05.32]Don't eat it.
[177:08.84]Pizza Bot, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[177:11.12]Bitstream, thank you, Pizza Bot.
[177:14.80]Thank you so much for the $10.
[177:18.16]CK, luck, thanks for the $5.
[177:20.42]Five bucks towards the clown card joke.
[177:22.68]Eventually, at some point before I stop streaming and doing anything to do with online stuff, I'm going to have a clown card.
[177:30.74]It's going to happen.
[177:31.44]It will happen eventually.
[177:34.32]I promise.
[177:36.51]Thank you, TheUnraveling, for the two bucks.
[177:38.45]Mouth, mouth.
[177:42.14]Thank you, DavePetaSquared.
[177:45.76]Peter, Peter.
[177:48.16]And they said, VR Iska made me do this.
[177:51.92]Give a dollar.
[177:53.77]Thank you.
[177:56.67]Thank you to...
[177:59.53]Senho, Senho for the $1.
[178:02.20]Superintendent Chalmers, thanks for the $1.
[178:03.82]Hello, Mr. Jeremy.
[178:05.00]Can you please do a Microsoft Sam impression?
[178:08.24]And then say panther in the same voice.
[178:15.18]You can't do a Microsoft Sam impression.
[178:21.45]That's... You just...
[178:27.40]No, you can't.
[178:28.02]It's a computer.
[178:29.28]I can't do a computer voice.
[178:31.70]There's no computer voices that can be done.
[178:35.59]Thank you, Dr. Epic Frag for the $5.
[178:38.47]Here's some for the Earthworm Jim's suit fund.
[178:41.81]Hawkeye of Mine, thanks for $10.
[178:43.19]Let's give Jerm a Scrooge McDuck swimming pool.
[178:49.38]Dr. Epic Frag again for the $1.
[178:51.24]Where's the Pokémon sock reveal?
[178:56.10]Uh, I-T space, G-O-T space, L-O-S-T space, I-N space, T-H-E space, M-A-I-L space.
[179:15.29]Period.
[179:17.90]There's your Microsoft Sam voice right there.
[179:21.18]Thank you.
[179:22.23]Future Gamer, thanks for the $1.
[179:23.51]If you do get a Vive, I recommend playing Payday 2 VR, Jet Island, or Fallout 4 if it still comes with Vive, Google Earth VR, and Waltz of the Wizard.
[179:35.42]I actually am... Once they put out the new one is when I'm going to do it.
[179:42.13]Once I put out the new one.
[179:44.33]I have nothing to do with Vive's development.
[179:45.83]Once they put out the new one, I'll buy it.
[179:47.79]Because then the other ones would probably be a little cheaper because the new one will come out and you don't know what happens with the fucking iPhone.
[179:54.67]So I'm sure it'll happen.
[179:57.81]Uh, thank you to Broluck for the $1, not a thousand.
[180:02.00]No, this is on top of the thousand.
[180:04.84]Let me explain myself.
[180:07.34]I only was actually planning on donating like $200.
[180:12.05]Your stubbornness led me down that expensive road.
[180:14.97]I recently picked up a lot of hours at work and I'll be fine without the money.
[180:19.73]Enjoy.
[180:23.61]My stubbornness.
[180:29.76]You wanted me to say that I was bad at the game.
[180:31.74]Only 200.
[180:33.50]Only 200.
[180:45.10]That's so much fucking money.
[180:50.04]Thank you.
[180:50.80]Thank you for the fucking... Only 200 bucks.
[180:56.99]First of all, yeah, that's what... What are you talking about?
[180:59.85]That's a huge amount of money.
[181:01.17]That's 200 fucking dollars that you gave me.
[181:09.26]And then he turned it into a thousand.
[181:10.90]God damn it.
[181:12.02]I'm gonna fucking cut it.
[181:17.34]Uh, Brolock, fucking thank you.
[181:20.44]Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[181:25.86]Uh, we have BroccoliBert, Adala, hey Jerma, you're one of my favorite people.
[181:28.86]I know $5 isn't a lot, but it's all I got.
[181:31.58]Thank you.
[181:34.14]Uh, Vivian, thank you Vivian for the $10.
[181:36.07]Jerma, say trans rights.
[181:37.71]Thanks Jerem, we love you and Shito, and love catching the streams when we can.
[181:41.45]Sorry to hear you're dying so soon, but it happens to the best of us.
[181:47.76]Yeah, well I'm still here I'm still here I'm still good End of the life voice It's star wait star is here
[182:23.19]I can't believe Jerm is dead.
[182:31.81]Is it something I'm not picking up on here?
[182:36.86]What am I missing here?
[182:52.10]I just heard a door close.
[182:53.24]There's people that live here.
[183:02.12]Dr. Phil Jerma is in the closet there.
[183:05.60]Dr. Phil's not here.
[183:06.64]Alright, well, regardless, whatever.
[183:15.68]Thank you for the $10.
[183:18.20]I really appreciate the $10.
[183:20.66]And I'm still here.
[183:21.72]I did not die.
[183:23.04]I'm good to go.
[183:26.00]I am good to go for the rest of my life and I'll be able to drink.
[183:31.74]This is actually really comically huge.
[183:35.34]This is almost embarrassing to have this near me.
[183:38.64]But thank you.
[183:39.24]Thank you, BroccoliBurt, for the $1.
[183:40.42]Jeremy, you're one of my favorite people.
[183:41.74]Got you a bar, but you got another dollar here.
[183:44.22]Always wanted to donate, but haven't had the money.
[183:45.52]You're the best.
[183:46.10]You've honestly gotten me through some tough shit.
[183:50.35]Thank you.
[183:52.11]Happy to do so.
[183:53.60]Thank you so much, Broccoli Bird.
[183:56.46]Much love to you.
[183:57.40]For real.
[184:00.92]Large mug, or it's not a... Look.
[184:07.79]Now this one is oversized too.
[184:09.07]They're both oversized, okay?
[184:11.30]That one's like a three.
[184:12.44]This is a four.
[184:14.12]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[184:14.72]That's like a triple.
[184:16.36]If this hair goes in my eye again, I'm going to eat it on stream.
[184:19.38]I'm going to fucking pull it out and I'm going to consume it.
[184:27.03]Okay.
[184:27.67]It almost happened again.
[184:32.99]Hey, hack it fast.
[184:34.08]Thanks for the $2.
[184:34.46]Bum...
[184:37.44]Stickabumbum.
[184:40.28]Thank you Colonel Crackers for the dollar.
[184:41.69]Hey Jerma, are you gonna make the green screen stream a yearly stream?
[184:44.79]It was an amazing stream.
[184:46.43]Probably not.
[184:48.07]I probably would want to do it once or twice.
[184:51.59]Not that much.
[184:53.69]Because I feel like it loses its magic if you do it too many times.
[184:57.91]That's why a lot of people say, oh, why don't you do a Jerma Rumble event?
[185:00.71]Like every, once a month or something.
[185:02.79]Eh.
[185:04.27]Loses its flavor.
[185:06.26]And it gives enough time to have, obviously, more characters and more stuff and more references.
[185:11.74]It's better to space it out much further.
[185:15.36]But once a year, I would really have to get in front of the camera more than once.
[185:20.73]Because I'm not going to just put out the same footage where, hey, yeah, remember that footage I recorded?
[185:26.85]I'd want to get in front of the screen and do a lot more to give you more to use.
[185:32.68]Not with that footage, no.
[185:34.34]But there will be another night that we watch.
[185:37.63]I really have to get on top of that because I want it to happen soon.
[185:42.17]But, where are we?
[185:45.27]Okay.
[185:47.17]We are almost at the end of yesterday.
[185:52.41]And then we'll just power right in to today.
[185:57.72]Do a Jerma Rumble every stream.
[186:01.84]Thank you to Bet3.
[186:02.70]Bet3.
[186:04.35]For the $5, thank you so much for the videos and streams, Jerma.
[186:07.51]You've helped so many people along the way with your humor and optimism.
[186:10.83]Also, thank you for the constant support of your LGBT fans.
[186:17.92]Yeah, you guys know how I stand on these things.
[186:23.06]You know what I mean?
[186:27.45]You know, do whatever you want to do.
[186:30.29]I can't tell you to do anything, you know?
[186:35.69]My philosophy has always been, you know, you be the best person that you want to be.
[186:42.17]That's it.
[186:45.01]That's it.
[186:48.36]It's as simple as that.
[186:50.06]And I am not going to tell somebody how to run their life, you know, because I wouldn't want somebody to tell me to run mine.
[186:58.84]And political shit aside,
[187:03.86]I have a lot of beliefs that are from all over the political spectrum.
[187:08.08]We don't talk about them because I don't want this to be a politics stream.
[187:12.83]I don't think there's a reason to do it.
[187:14.53]Because I'd like to keep this stream and this community kind of away from all that.
[187:32.76]Not good enough.
[187:36.49]Oh, he's such a neutral!
[187:39.62]No, you can read between the lines here over the last few years.
[187:46.34]I think a lot of people are dynamic.
[187:53.36]Radical centrist.
[187:56.26]No.
[188:01.35]You're not allowed to like everyone.
[188:02.97]It has nothing to do with liking everyone.
[188:07.59]Everybody has their own opinions and I don't need to share them.
[188:09.91]I don't have to talk about them.
[188:12.74]I don't feel like I have very many extreme positions on very much.
[188:31.82]Three minutes slow mode, please.
[188:36.96]Politics are polarizing.
[188:38.98]And that's why I don't talk about them.
[188:41.92]Because that's not what this community is for.
[188:47.05]It's not what this community is about.
[188:49.71]It's about us hanging out, getting together, and not worrying about that shit for a little while.
[188:56.09]The world's a crazy fucking place.
[188:57.29]The world is a crazy fucking place.
[189:01.56]But
[189:04.76]I'd rather us just be able to hang out and have a good time.
[189:16.50]So people that say, what's your opinion on this?
[189:18.72]What's your opinion on that?
[189:19.56]How do you feel about that?
[189:20.32]Say this, say that.
[189:20.84]How do you feel about that?
[189:21.42]It's like, it's tough because I don't want
[189:25.84]I don't want a bunch of people to, you know, using certain things that I say as examples to not want to listen to what I have to say, not want to like me, not want to talk to me, not want to listen to my streams.
[189:37.52]Oh, no, fuck that guy.
[189:38.50]He said that?
[189:39.66]Fuck him.
[189:52.93]I'd rather just remove it entirely.
[189:59.66]At least in this space.
[190:01.88]If you wanted to have a private conversation with me about something like that, you know, so be it, right?
[190:07.23]Like, I've had private conversations before with some people in this community about, you know, political stuff before, but not in a forum like this.
[190:20.49]Which is why that jokey, but also very serious, we don't talk about politics on the stream is still there.
[190:32.23]I feel like people are trying to bait Jerma into talking politics so they can meme about it at his expense.
[190:37.49]No, I don't, I don't think so.
[190:40.40]I think everything's just fine.
[190:49.60]And even if they are, then that's okay.
[190:53.04]It doesn't, because I'm not, I'm not going to give
[190:59.11]I'm not going to give any... There's not going to be a stream where I sit up here and I talk about, let me tell you this, and let me tell you that, because that's not how I am anyways.
[191:13.48]What is the camera resolution?
[191:14.78]Very bad.
[191:22.51]I've never gotten the vibe that the chat is malicious and it's trolling.
[191:24.97]No, I don't think so either.
[191:31.60]But to close the book on that... We don't even need to open it.
[191:41.13]At least here.
[191:46.91]Resident Evil 2 on Friday?
[191:48.14]Resident Evil 2 comes out on fucking Friday.
[191:51.50]Holy shit.
[192:01.74]Politics ruins streams.
[192:03.40]Please never do it.
[192:04.74]I'm not gonna.
[192:06.32]I'm not gonna.
[192:09.44]I'll say a few things, but not anything to... I'm not gonna have any political arguments.
[192:16.86]Why would I want to do that here?
[192:19.72]There's no reason for me to do that here.
[192:26.74]I want you to have fun.
[192:29.42]I don't want you to feel like you're being targeted or, you know, yelled at or told that you're, like, stupid or something.
[192:35.68]Like, why would I want to do that?
[192:36.80]I want you to fucking come here and have fun.
[192:45.19]But... Move on, Jay.
[192:47.77]See you in three minutes.
[192:57.92]I think the reason why there's such a long slow-mo right now is because we're on a topic that's, you know, really, people kind of, you know what I'm saying?
[193:12.68]Careful.
[193:15.42]Because you said it.
[193:17.04]Yeah, but that's, you know, I don't want it to derail everything, which it kind of already has.
[193:22.84]So we're going to just, here we go.
[193:24.49]Thank you to...
[193:27.11]Plus W plus for the $10.
[193:28.95]Hello, I'm drunk and sad.
[193:30.15]Have you ever been drunk and sad?
[193:31.55]Yeah.
[193:33.84]Yeah.
[193:39.26]That sucks.
[193:39.64]I'm sorry to hear that.
[193:41.10]That's not cool.
[193:49.75]I'm really, really fucking sorry that whatever you're going through is making you feel like that and you're drinking and you're sad.
[193:54.75]That sucks.
[193:56.51]Hopefully you get through it.
[194:01.00]That was plus W plus for the 10 bucks.
[194:03.88]That was last night.
[194:05.76]Hey, Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $1.
[194:07.30]Hey, Jerma guest, this is the last chance to donate before the big day tomorrow.
[194:10.34]Can't give as much as these oil tycoons in chat, but I hope this is enough to get Shito a treat.
[194:16.16]I'll get Shito a treat.
[194:19.96]Thank you, Clueless Sniper.
[194:21.84]Almost at the end of last night.
[194:23.68]I told you if it went in my eye again, I was going to rip it out.
[194:35.35]Thank you, Shogo.
[194:36.35]Thank you, Shogo for the, or Shugo for the $1.
[194:40.00]Hey, Jerma, been a fan for a long time, ever since I stumbled on your TF2 videos way back when.
[194:45.32]Every stream and every video are always an incredible joy for me.
[194:47.82]Lately, I've been involved a lot in the community and it really is something special.
[194:52.24]You and your community are a massive part of my childhood and now my adulthood.
[194:56.41]Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you to Broluck and Gil, my man, both of whom offered to gift me subscriptions personally, nothing but love.
[195:11.33]Hell yeah.
[195:11.77]Thank you.
[195:12.43]Thank you, Sugo.
[195:17.06]I'm so thrilled that people can come together here and have fun.
[195:21.36]And can make friends.
[195:23.14]And can play games together.
[195:25.36]That's what it's for.
[195:26.98]That's what it's for.
[195:30.00]Having a Discord, having a community, it's great to know that people are meeting each other and hanging out.
[195:35.95]It's awesome.
[195:37.90]Thank you for the $1, and thanks for being part of the community.
[195:40.98]Thank you.
[195:43.12]Stop having fun.
[195:44.53]Stop having fun this instant.
[195:52.27]When's the stream going to end?
[195:53.91]Probably 30 or 40 minutes.
[195:54.91]We're almost done with the bits here.
[195:58.75]Kill Gannon, thanks for the $1.
[195:59.89]Hey, Gemma, please reconsider checking out PsyOps, the Mindgate conspiracy.
[196:03.99]Cool physics-based combat superpower game on the PS2.
[196:07.33]I know you'll love it.
[196:09.23]Yeah, that is true.
[196:10.23]You did mention that.
[196:10.89]Somebody did mention that before, too.
[196:14.31]Yeah.
[196:16.21]Hey, Yellow Kuru, thanks for the $5.
[196:18.78]Good job, man, running from it.
[196:23.96]Talking about last night, running from the monster, I believe.
[196:27.66]Never trust a purple.
[196:28.32]Thanks for the $10.
[196:29.06]You cleared the platforming puzzle incredibly fast.
[196:31.16]By contrast, Lobos Jr., the guy who does Dark Souls Challenge runs for fun, took hours to get through it.
[196:38.18]Genuinely impressed.
[196:43.23]Damn.
[196:48.75]That's fucking... Wow.
[196:54.77]I'm sure he had a lot of triumphs over my times in other places in the game, so.
[197:07.81]That's pretty cool.
[197:09.25]Thank you for the $10 purple.
[197:17.56]Pinwheel.
[197:18.78]The pinwheel shit.
[197:23.13]It's alright.
[197:23.91]You can die at a pinwheel at least four times and you still have a good playthrough.
[197:27.69]Hey, thank you, Yellow Kuru, for the $4.
[197:29.48]Never for free.
[197:31.82]Never for free.
[197:32.86]If you're good at something.
[197:34.50]Never do it for free.
[197:36.46]And finally... No, no, no, no, no.
[197:38.02]Not finally.
[197:39.84]Errorless thanks for the $1.
[197:40.56]Jokes aside, you're one of the most favorite people alive.
[197:43.92]I always love catching your streams, whether silly or chill.
[197:47.05]Keep up the good stuff, Jerm.
[197:51.69]Thank you.
[197:53.34]Thanks a lot.
[197:56.68]Glad you have fun.
[197:57.38]Glad you think it's a good time.
[197:59.21]Thank you Dr. EpicFrag for the $1.
[198:01.45]This alien looks like something out of the movies game.
[198:05.39]Every cutscene in this game felt like something out of the movies game.
[198:09.99]They were... not very good.
[198:15.41]Hey, Freudian Weapon, thanks for the $1.
[198:16.99]I was watching the stream before I went to bed seven hours ago.
[198:19.70]Now I'm up getting ready for work and you're still kicking ass.
[198:23.71]That's one way to put it.
[198:25.33]Kudos for seeing this game through.
[198:28.11]We did.
[198:29.07]Cheated a little bit, but still did.
[198:32.32]So Sretto, thanks for the $1.
[198:33.78]Good night.
[198:34.14]I tried to stay awake for the whole stream, but my left eye, right eye, middle eyes are closing.
[198:43.68]That was really good.
[198:45.48]That was very good.
[198:47.84]Dr. Epic Frag, thanks for the $1.
[198:49.62]Last stream.
[198:50.36]Oh wait, that's not a good thing.
[198:53.63]He's still here.
[198:55.01]In the shirt.
[198:55.55]He's still here.
[198:56.25]He didn't go anywhere.
[198:57.83]Holeof1zombie, thanks for the $1.
[199:00.99]Go to bed.
[199:01.43]Go to bed.
[199:01.81]I said go to bed.
[199:02.59]Thank you, Holeof1zombie.
[199:04.51]And then IamMonk.
[199:06.13]I said I would, and I did.
[199:07.49]Thanks for the $1.
[199:08.65]I am Monk.
[199:12.36]Those are the bits from last night.
[199:14.96]Which takes us... to... today.
[199:22.79]Which I should be able to go like this.
[199:28.97]I should.
[199:32.04]And I can.
[199:35.74]Let's go down to a couple hours ago.
[199:43.04]To FatboySunt for the $1.
[199:45.57]I don't know if you'll see this message, but unless you actually had the memory to remember the death joke, I hope reminding you was worth it.
[199:54.01]Death joke.
[199:55.51]I'm not entirely certain.
[199:57.39]Superintendent Chalmers, thanks for the $1.
[200:00.33]It's a clip.
[200:00.95]Let's see what the clip is.
[200:03.35]On his fax machine.
[200:06.67]Say, my sweet, sweet Jerma.
[200:11.74]You were neat.
[200:13.38]You had nice feet.
[200:15.14]Good night, sweet prince.
[200:17.74]Bye-bye.
[200:24.63]He would have done the same to me, I'm sure.
[200:28.23]Yeah, probably.
[200:30.93]Yeah.
[200:36.05]Fucking feet, man.
[200:41.82]Thank you, Joel, for the kind words.
[200:44.46]Appreciate it.
[200:48.66]And thank you to Superintendent Chalmers for showing the clip.
[200:52.25]Hey, Nipple, thanks for the $1.
[200:53.63]I love you, Papa.
[200:54.69]Hey.
[200:57.17]Thanks, kiddo.
[200:59.97]Retrowave, thanks for the bits.
[201:02.62]Marvash Magali, thanks for the $1.
[201:04.26]Chat can get pretty wild sometimes, but you always manage to keep it cool.
[201:07.58]But has there ever been a time when you wish you were allowed to say, fuck you chat out loud?
[201:17.96]Not really.
[201:22.36]maybe a maybe a little bit maybe I can't really give you an exact memory but there's been maybe like out of the hundreds and hundreds of times I've streamed I've probably probably yeah there's probably been one time when I was just like at least I'm just looking over here like
[201:45.37]You don't fucking know anything.
[201:48.39]You want to talk to me about knowing shit, but you don't fucking know a thing.
[201:52.86]You don't know what it's like to say, like, yeah, there's probably been maybe three or four times total.
[202:04.32]Maybe like twice.
[202:06.48]Two point hospital.
[202:12.09]Two point hospital.
[202:14.15]I'm looking the wrong way?
[202:15.01]Oh, yeah, like, chat's that way.
[202:19.11]Let me tell you something.
[202:21.17]You bunch of fucking idiots.
[202:23.51]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[202:26.53]I ruined your footage.
[202:27.35]I ruined your footage.
[202:28.07]You can't use it.
[202:45.19]Chat confirmed.
[202:46.17]No, no.
[202:46.75]That was a joke.
[202:47.93]That was a routine I was doing.
[202:50.23]But the answer is maybe sometimes.
[202:53.20]Not very often.
[202:55.90]Joel Raid 2?
[202:59.12]Oh, Joel came in right at the end of the stream here.
[203:03.18]Right when I'm talking about the routine that I was doing.
[203:07.92]But thanks, Joel.
[203:09.60]We just listened to your clip of you talking about giving me those nice send-off words about the things that are lower than your ankles.
[203:22.75]So welcome, everybody, from Joel.
[203:23.87]We're just kind of hanging out, going over the bits from the day and a little bit from last night, too.
[203:31.02]Hope you had a great stream there, Joel.
[203:33.36]And you probably did because you always do.
[203:34.64]You got a great fucking stream there.
[203:37.00]And welcome, everybody.
[203:37.96]Follow Joel if you haven't.
[203:41.51]He said a word started with an F and ended with a T. And there was two E's in the middle.
[203:45.79]It was a four-letter word.
[203:47.21]So, you need to do the math.
[203:52.21]But, yeah, and then I'm going to end the stream.
[203:54.43]So, not much going on after this.
[204:03.97]Thank you to Solid Milk for the $1.
[204:06.49]Jerma, have you not seen Final Destination?
[204:08.33]You avoided death, but it will come back another day.
[204:11.63]Yeah, but that's when the next movie comes out, which they come out like once every few years.
[204:20.06]Great Canadian Fuck Club added to his hundreds, hundreds of gift subscriptions.
[204:24.84]Hundreds of them.
[204:26.42]Thank you.
[204:27.60]Great Canadian Fuck Club.
[204:31.30]Just adding to the
[204:34.69]ridiculous amount of people that you have subbed to this channel now.
[204:40.17]507 gift subs.
[204:42.07]You are a significant portion of every single sub on this stream.
[204:48.72]That's... 507 gifted subs.
[205:03.38]That's a very significant portion of the amount of people that are totally subbed.
[205:06.66]It is.
[205:09.68]Holy shit.
[205:11.16]And you seem to just keep going.
[205:14.28]You, okay, you like cross that threshold of holy shit that you never expected any more than that.
[205:22.05]And you cross that threshold and you still go.
[205:25.67]My god.
[205:30.41]My god.
[205:33.94]Yeah, an actual oil tycoon.
[205:38.78]Wow.
[205:39.42]Thank you.
[205:40.56]Thank you so much, Great Canadian Fuck Club.
[205:47.06]That's a lot.
[205:48.66]That's an insane amount.
[205:51.57]But moving on to the bits here.
[205:53.35]We had... What does this say?
[205:56.55]I'll look at these all coming in.
[206:02.01]And last night, too.
[206:02.82]Last night, like... I forget this morning how many subs came in this morning and last night.
[206:10.54]Do you see what's going on right now?
[206:12.40]Do you see what's happening?
[206:15.06]Do you see what's going on right now?
[206:18.29]You thought I was making it up.
[206:19.91]I want to prove that I'm not making up shit.
[206:23.35]It's in my eye.
[206:27.09]I'm not making it up.
[206:29.57]Do you see?
[206:30.07]See?
[206:50.14]Okay.
[206:51.96]But did it like transport dirt into my eye?
[206:54.12]I don't understand.
[206:54.88]Why is that dirt on my hair?
[206:56.78]I have dirty hair?
[206:58.28]Do I have dirty hair?
[206:59.94]Okay.
[207:08.29]Thank you to... Solid Milk.
[207:14.33]Codeman, thanks for the two bucks.
[207:15.79]If any streamer could come back from the dead, I knew it would be you.
[207:20.45]I don't know what you're talking about, but I was fine today.
[207:23.33]Everything was good.
[207:25.13]Thank you for the $2.
[207:25.83]Thank you to Errorless for the $10.
[207:28.49]Thank you, Errorless.
[207:29.13]Your death ghost scene may have been one of the most well-executed gags you've ever done.
[207:34.17]And thank you for duct taping the pillows on your body.
[207:36.18]That couldn't have been more perfect.
[207:42.58]The ghost scene.
[207:49.91]You might have had a TV on in the background.
[207:52.79]There might have been a scary movie on the TV behind you or something, but thanks for the 10 bucks.
[207:58.71]I appreciate it.
[207:59.59]Thank you.
[208:01.38]It means a lot.
[208:01.88]Thank you.
[208:02.32]And somebody just gave fucking a ton of money.
[208:04.98]Literally a huge, a massive amount just came in again.
[208:08.56]Keep the like $3,000 or $4,000 in 24-hour stream thing going.
[208:12.82]Apparently, that's fucking insane.
[208:15.34]So Tempest just gave $105.
[208:17.21]Holy shit.
[208:22.86]And Tempest says, Hey Jerma, just wanted to tell you about a year ago today I had a major depressive meltdown in the lowest point in my life.
[208:30.04]And your videos were one of the only things to help get me through it.
[208:32.52]Thank you.
[208:36.23]That is a powerful fucking thing to say.
[208:44.01]I'm really, really, really happy that you're getting through it.
[208:49.17]and it's that's that is like a I can't even fucking believe it like that's such a powerful fucking thing to say to somebody really really happy that you're doing better hell yeah stay strong keep fucking going thank you for the hundred dollars thank you the one hundred dollars
[209:14.84]And a message that I will never forget.
[209:16.18]I won't, so.
[209:18.56]It's just, that's... Thank you.
[209:27.38]Back a couple hours ago here.
[209:38.23]Thank you so much.
[209:38.97]Like, I still, I'm fucking floored.
[209:42.11]Every time this happens, somebody says something like that.
[209:47.34]Sometimes I'm like lying down in bed.
[209:49.26]I told you, like, I'm just like, you're talking about me?
[209:53.36]Like, you're talking about me.
[209:54.41]That's fucking, and I can't even explain the feeling.
[210:00.05]I'm so fucking happy that you're doing better.
[210:01.97]I really am.
[210:09.46]Thank you for everything.
[210:15.36]We had Demonic Cucumber for $1.
[210:20.42]It said, who made this?
[210:23.40]Who made this?
[210:36.75]That's fucking great.
[210:49.07]Who did that?
[210:50.67]Who made this?
[210:53.71]Anybody want a fucking boxing helmet?
[210:57.61]Anybody need, like, hockey pads for a 14-year-old?
[211:06.92]The pillow makes it.
[211:07.78]It just, it does.
[211:10.32]You'd get fucking fined if you had that on in a football game.
[211:14.84]Thank you for that.
[211:21.40]Hey Flames, thanks for the five dollars.
[211:22.98]Happy birthday.
[211:24.22]Happy birthday, Flames.
[211:26.46]Uh, six dollars actually from Flames.
[211:27.98]Hey Jerma, could you say the name Ethan for me?
[211:30.74]My friend's birthday is coming up and I want to edit his name into the Rats mixtape.
[211:35.13]Sure.
[211:35.97]I'll make it easy for you.
[211:38.99]And Ethan, it's your birthday today.
[211:43.73]And Ethan's been such a good boy, so you can like really feed that in.
[211:46.95]You know, you can really feed that into the song.
[211:50.66]See?
[211:51.56]Happy birthday, Ethan.
[212:00.37]And thank you to Flames for the $6 and the special birthday surprise for Ethan.
[212:10.40]Heard he's a great, great Ethan.
[212:15.54]Happy birthday.
[212:17.63]Hey! Pilot guy - thanks for the $15 pilot guy.
[212:23.63]Cheer, cheer, cheer, cheer. 25! and 66- no 61 65. That was so dumb. It really was.
[212:33.63]Thank you for the 15. That was the worst part of the game probably. No it wasn't - there were like 3 or 4 sections where I could've attributed that to.
[212:43.63]But thank you for the $15 pilot guy.
[212:47.78]FreudianWeapon, thanks for the $1.
[212:49.18]jermaHeart, right back at you, thank you.
[212:52.30]WildFox, thanks for the $1.
[212:53.82]Hey, Jerma, the old games are always the best to watch you play.
[212:57.45]Hope you do more of the odd ones.
[213:01.71]There's still a shitload of PS2 games back there.
[213:03.55]The one with the last shitload, I mean, like, probably eight.
[213:06.17]But they're all going to be worth playing.
[213:07.80]Eventually.
[213:09.64]On days like today.
[213:11.36]And yesterday.
[213:16.18]I always have a lot of fun.
[213:17.24]The streams are always some of my favorites.
[213:19.62]When we tap into an odd, old game.
[213:22.03]They really are.
[213:26.31]A shitload.
[213:26.89]Eight.
[213:29.21]Also, thank you to Scar for the $1.
[213:31.01]Jeremiah, I think the reason this game's plot is so asinine is because they never expected anyone to get this far.
[213:38.80]Maybe.
[213:40.86]Possible.
[213:42.86]But thank you for the $1.
[213:43.68]Thank you, Dorkcube, for the $1.
[213:46.50]Tell me the truth.
[213:47.08]Do you believe that?
[213:48.00]Tell me the truth.
[213:48.64]Do you believe that?
[213:49.54]Tell me the truth.
[213:51.10]Do you believe that?
[213:54.45]Uh, George, thank you, George Maka for the $1.
[213:57.31]With the Philosopher's Stone and Hohenheim, Lifeline turned out to be just like Fullmetal Alchemist.
[214:02.33]In space.
[214:03.75]At least Edward was never as... I don't want... This is spoilers.
[214:10.61]I'm not gonna get... I don't wanna give animated cartoon television show spoilers.
[214:16.06]So, thank you for the $1, George.
[214:19.22]I do see what you're saying.
[214:21.16]I do see what you mean.
[214:24.18]Also, I'm going to move some windows here because it's better to be facing this way.
[214:29.87]In my opinion.
[214:31.43]Oh, I'm so tired.
[214:31.93]I just crashed.
[214:40.60]I took the headset off.
[214:41.70]I fucking jumped in the shower just to rinse my body.
[214:45.32]And I fell asleep.
[214:46.50]I was too tired.
[214:49.34]Too tired to dream.
[214:51.50]Yeah.
[214:52.60]It really was like that.
[214:54.84]Excalibur, thanks for the $1.
[214:56.20]Once this game is done, Jerma shall return to the heavens and make his final judgment on humanity.
[215:07.22]I'm not a god.
[215:09.23]Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $1.
[215:10.59]Turn your Jerma off and on again to activate Jex mode.
[215:15.59]I tried to turn the camera off and on, but it didn't work, so I can't activate it.
[215:18.23]Thank you for the $1.
[215:21.95]You guys, does this ever happen to you guys?
[215:24.35]I'm sure it does.
[215:26.13]When I, like, sit on a computer screen, and more than, like, two or three hours go by, I feel like my eyes start to water.
[215:37.39]And even when I take a break and I, you know, throw some water on my face and just hang out, it's like, it's annoying.
[215:42.57]I need to get like gamer goggles.
[215:51.13]You might need to turn down your brightness.
[215:53.65]I think it's actually pretty low.
[215:56.29]It's like on the 30 to 40% side.
[215:57.89]It's not that high, I don't think.
[216:00.33]Maybe I'll try that.
[216:00.96]I'll get gamer goggles and I'll turn the brightness down like another 10% and see if that helps.
[216:04.82]Because sometimes it's just like, ugh.
[216:07.86]I have really sensitive eyes though anyways.
[216:09.43]If I go outside in the wind for even five seconds, but there's a little breeze of wind and it hits my face, tears just stream down my cheeks.
[216:19.97]It looks bad.
[216:20.57]It looks like I'm just crying.
[216:23.21]Streaming down my face.
[216:26.98]I walk into like a coffee shop or something out of the wind and it's like, can I get a latte?
[216:32.36]And they're just like, holy shit, okay.
[216:38.69]NVIDIA swag bag?
[216:41.33]What?
[216:42.31]Hey, that shepherd, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[216:45.43]Is this that streamer that beat death and lifeline in the same stream?
[216:59.99]Yeah.
[217:00.15]I don't know about the death part, but the life part, sure.
[217:05.66]Thank you, The Shepherd, for the $10.
[217:06.74]Thank you, Canadian Dynamite, for the $1.
[217:08.32]Haven't had this much fun watching your stream since The Sims 4.
[217:12.05]Nice to see you stream a day before my birthday.
[217:14.11]Thanks for the good memories.
[217:15.77]Canadian Dynamite, happy birthday.
[217:17.87]Thank you for watching.
[217:20.11]I'm glad that you enjoyed this stream as much as you enjoyed that stream, which is arguably one of my favorite times sitting in this chair.
[217:27.98]The Sims 4 mod streams...
[217:30.99]Especially the first one.
[217:32.09]Was probably the most fun I've ever had sitting in a chair with a game.
[217:36.60]Probably.
[217:39.34]Talking about tears streaming down my face, that happened.
[217:42.46]That actually happened during that stream.
[217:47.85]I will never be able to replicate or replace how fun that stream was.
[217:51.47]But we can do other things.
[217:52.99]We got a lot of other plans, so don't worry.
[217:55.32]Don't worry.
[217:57.51]But, thanks for the $1.
[217:58.97]Thank you, Dorkcube, for the $1.
[218:00.25]My frigid heart, the only thing that melted is your labo.
[218:05.12]Dr. EpicFrag, thanks for the $1.
[218:06.32]Next game is Kenshi, right?
[218:09.22]No, not anymore.
[218:11.24]It's a great game, but I think I got my stream time out of it, so thank you, though.
[218:15.72]Double D, thanks for the $1.
[218:16.46]Hey, Jeremiah, any update on the t-shirts?
[218:18.16]Do you have an exact date, or is it up in the air?
[218:21.08]It is done.
[218:22.22]The shirt design is complete.
[218:23.66]It's final.
[218:25.22]I'm just going to get the raw PDF files from Ashley probably either tonight or tomorrow.
[218:32.36]And then over the next few days, I would assume, some point probably... I would probably say after this weekend.
[218:39.18]So...
[218:41.29]Expect somewhere on Monday or Tuesday, maybe, for me to have a link and you to be able to buy a shirt.
[218:51.25]Two shirts.
[218:51.87]Glue Man's coming back.
[218:52.79]The original Glue Man shirt will be back.
[218:54.36]And the Solar System shirt will also be available to purchase on that day for the next... If I can do it forever, I will.
[219:02.40]Because there's no reason for me to do a limited run, I don't think.
[219:05.96]We'll see.
[219:06.76]Don't hold me to that.
[219:07.71]Let me find that out first.
[219:09.99]But...
[219:11.71]Uh, yes.
[219:12.33]Next week.
[219:14.93]Thank you to Dorkube.
[219:17.41]Talking about me looking like a corpse.
[219:21.26]I don't know why that would be, but thank you.
[219:23.64]Rocco Forto, thanks for the $1.
[219:25.18]Hey, Jerm, just wanted to say congrats on not dying today.
[219:27.78]The new semester started this week, and I would not last till finals without your wacky, epic gameplay commentary.
[219:34.46]Keep wearing that goalie gear, and stay safe.
[219:39.20]I will.
[219:40.58]And good luck.
[219:42.44]on the new semester.
[219:43.94]Thank you.
[219:46.81]Good luck.
[219:47.61]Much love to you.
[219:50.63]Wow, Epic Gamer.
[219:52.81]What, that's, what's wrong with Epic Gamer?
[219:55.75]I'll take the title of Epic Gamer.
[219:57.67]That's fine.
[220:01.08]I can't wear Jerma shirts.
[220:02.70]What if I'm associated, what?
[220:05.00]What if you do crimes?
[220:08.08]If you commit a crime with my t-shirt on, they're not gonna think that I committed the crime too.
[220:13.25]It's like, there he is.
[220:15.05]He robbed a bank.
[220:16.25]And he's wearing a Metallica shirt.
[220:18.15]Go arrest Metallica too.
[220:20.53]They must have had something to do with this.
[220:32.76]Don't stop that.
[220:35.08]Stop it.
[220:37.15]Thank you, SoysAWC, for the three bucks.
[220:40.87]Hey, Jeremy, you're a genius when it comes to entertaining me.
[220:43.24]I want you to be part of a major decision in my life.
[220:47.34]Okay, and I want to quit this job because I'm not respected for my hard work, input, and input, because I refuse to twiddle my thumbs just to clock in hours.
[220:56.61]I'm carrying this project, but we're probably getting none of the credit.
[221:04.75]want me to be a part of a major decision.
[221:07.05]What's the decision?
[221:10.11]To stop working on the project or quitting or leaving or should you stay or should you leave?
[221:26.40]There's a couple of scenarios.
[221:29.74]I'm not a professional when it comes to stuff like this, but
[221:34.79]I would say if you're not happy with what you're doing and you're putting in a lot of work and you're not getting what you think out, what you should be getting out of it, then you need to start kind of looking for something else, something, maybe try looking for another job, try looking for another place in the same field.
[221:51.58]And if you're able to, you know, get a job and leave the one that you're currently at.
[221:58.95]Now that's way easier said than done.
[222:01.01]I know that.
[222:01.47]And I understand that.
[222:04.72]But you don't want to put yourself into a position where you are going to essentially regret what you did.
[222:11.71]If you quit your job today and you're like, fuck this place, I'm out of here, and then I'm going to go look for something.
[222:17.73]If you can't find something, then you've got to be careful.
[222:20.62]Are you financially able to do that?
[222:21.98]Maybe you are.
[222:22.98]If you are financially able to do that, maybe that is something that you want to do.
[222:26.40]It really depends on your specific scenario.
[222:31.21]But unless you have a lot of money, I don't think that's a great idea personally.
[222:36.53]I would say the route of looking to interview other places and looking to find other stuff to do while you're still working.
[222:43.88]And then once you know that you've got a solid lead and you're going to be able to work somewhere else, maybe go through on that route instead.
[222:53.85]It's rough.
[222:55.29]There's no real correct answer here, I don't think.
[222:58.69]Because everybody's so different and everybody has such wildly different lives and jobs.
[223:03.33]And I don't know how essential you are as an employee to this project.
[223:07.78]And if you leave, are you negatively affecting other people?
[223:10.90]I don't know.
[223:11.56]I don't know.
[223:12.28]That's for you to decide.
[223:18.96]But the safest route is definitely to try to find something else.
[223:27.16]That's a great... Don't jump from the plane without a parachute.
[223:29.20]That is a great point.
[223:30.21]Yes, that is pretty much exactly what we're talking about.
[223:40.11]That's just my opinion, and that's just the way that I see things.
[223:43.86]Other people might see it differently, but...
[223:47.17]Gotta think about the future.
[223:48.95]You do.
[223:50.97]But I wish you the best of luck.
[223:52.79]Sorry to hear about the hardships at work.
[223:54.69]Hopefully you get it figured out real soon.
[223:56.66]Thank you, SoysAWC.
[224:00.46]Did my eyes just change color?
[224:05.68]No, I don't think so.
[224:06.54]I think they're only one color.
[224:09.39]Hey Sam, thanks for the $1, Sam K. Hey Jerma, I've been watching since the early TF2 days.
[224:14.01]You've always been my favorite and your hilarious shit has helped me through some tough times.
[224:17.79]Best wishes.
[224:19.42]Seems good.
[224:21.94]Seems good.
[224:22.94]Thank you.
[224:24.96]Thank you so much for sticking around this long.
[224:27.54]Solid Milk, thanks for the $10.
[224:28.94]Hey Jerma, you and Star are the reason that I like what I do.
[224:31.99]I was saving for a PC, but I wanted to give to my favorite streamer.
[224:36.81]Love you, jermaHeart.
[224:39.83]I really appreciate the $10.
[224:41.53]Thank you.
[224:43.29]Take care of yourself.
[224:43.95]Save for that PC.
[224:45.65]You don't have to give me a bunch of money.
[224:48.22]If you want to save for something, you want to buy something, do it.
[224:51.70]Take care of yourself.
[224:53.00]Treat yourself.
[224:54.30]Thank you so much for the $10 solid milk.
[224:59.77]Keep saving.
[225:01.29]You'll get something good.
[225:03.47]Uh, Coco Ronis, thanks for the $1.
[225:05.59]Hey, Jerma, I did this Rat Movie fan art back in 2006, but I don't know if you ever saw it.
[225:11.55]Uh, anyway, thought I'd link it just in case you never did see it.
[225:15.64]Let's see.
[225:18.66]Well, it's beautiful.
[225:19.20]Uh, I'll give you a link.
[225:21.74]I think I did see this a long time ago.
[225:23.42]2016, not 2006.
[225:25.22]Back in 2006, remember that one?
[225:26.22]Now here's a link to the art.
[225:34.86]That's that's fucking really cool.
[225:36.54]I know I have seen this I have The rat movie what does it say in the bottom Willem Dafoe Hugh Jackman Morgan Freeman, there's a lot of a listers in this one Modest narcissist.

[234:00.32]This is the most subs I've ever had.
[234:04.04]You guys blew right through the old record.
[234:05.68]This is the oldest- and I don't like to talk about subs and how many subs I have or give- I don't want to have a huge amount of like incentive for people to give subs.
[234:16.93]I just- I- I- This is... fucking ridiculous.
[234:30.37]You wanna know how many people have subscribed to this channel?
[234:33.80]I don't put it on like the screen, I don't... At least two, yeah?
[234:45.28]Well, the highest sub count I think I ever had, it was like a month ago.
[234:53.40]Would you like to know the number?
[234:55.96]And why I'm able to go into the studio all the time.
[234:59.38]And why I can potentially try to put up elaborate streams and elaborate things.
[235:03.64]Is because there are 6200 fucking subscribers on this channel right now.
[235:06.86]Do you understand?
[235:07.26]Do you understand how fucking an uncountable amount of money that is?
[235:22.32]I'm gonna use it.
[235:23.93]You bet your ass I'm gonna use it.
[235:34.38]And this all happened in the last... In the last, like, ten months.
[235:41.22]Drawn Flats, another five.
[235:42.22]Remember when I talked about the channel, like, growing in numbers and money and shit?
[235:49.44]This all happened in the last year.
[235:54.22]Like, six months ago or so, my subscriber count fucking, like, doubled.
[236:02.48]More than that.
[236:03.00]More than doubled.
[236:03.62]It like, almost, it like, one and a half'd almost.
[236:06.03]If you bet your ass I'm gonna fucking use every goddamn cent of this.
[236:15.75]As best as I can.
[236:23.22]Thank you all so much.
[236:24.04]Like, I, I can, I, I really, I'm speechless.
[236:26.52]I got nothing else to fuck, I got nothing else to say.
[236:30.38]I hope you think it's fun.
[236:31.06]I hope you enjoy your time here.
[236:32.44]I hope you... Another five from Peachy.
[236:41.35]Thank you so much, PeachyChu, for the five community subs on top of everybody else.
[236:58.99]I never thought that this was ever going to happen.
[237:01.55]I really didn't.
[237:04.98]Maybe two years ago.
[237:06.82]No, no, like a year and a half ago.
[237:10.28]Hitting something like even 2,000 or 3,000 subscribers was like a huge fucking deal.
[237:18.05]Dabs for dinner thanks for five community subs.
[237:20.89]Another five.
[237:23.83]That was a huge deal, what had happened.
[237:28.08]And there's been a huge influx of new people and a bunch of people that have been around for a long time.
[237:37.93]Silk, uh, thank you Silk for the five subs.
[237:45.32]There's been a lot of support from a lot of other people, too.
[237:47.26]I mean, think of all those other streamers that you know.
[237:51.04]Other YouTubers and shit that have, like, sent people over here.
[237:54.84]I...
[237:57.85]It's unbelievable.
[237:58.71]I can't fucking believe it.
[238:20.40]And that's another huge amount of money came in.
[238:27.52]But I don't want this stream to be about that, you know?
[238:33.16]I don't want the stream to be like, oh, I'm making money.
[238:36.49]Can't wait to make more money.
[238:38.05]Want to make some more on top of that too.
[238:41.39]That's not my intention.
[238:43.85]And having that many subscribers, I want to keep the channel the way that I intended it to be even before making a huge amount of fucking money.
[238:59.97]Lars Bloodaxe, thanks for the $111.
[239:04.20]$111.

[239:16.31]I'm in community college now, and the last semester was the worst.
[239:19.39]But your streams never fail to help me out and keep me smiling.
[239:22.69]I hope to contribute more when I get a steady income, because I genuinely love what you do.
[239:27.41]Thank you, and I'm glad you survived today.

[239:50.64]Hope you just know everybody.
[239:51.90]I'm repeating it a hundred times.
[239:55.69]But how do you think that some of the stuff that I want to do will happen?
[239:59.69]You know?
[240:03.57]Fucking Jerma Rumble live to streamed, you know, I mean that type of shit.
[240:06.74]I've talked about it a couple times Other stuff, there's a couple there's one thing that I was talking to my my buddy that does a lot of producing work with me about I could choose your own adventure stream where you guys get to like Go places and look at stuff.
[240:20.65]It is like the other stuff that I've talked about it It's all that's all fucking that's all possible.

[241:52.55]I don't want it to be a record because I don't want to see it like that.
[241:56.76]I don't want to have that be a, hey, well, you know, we broke our sub record, but that's not for me to tell you.
[242:03.12]That's not for me to tell you to do.
[242:10.94]Thank you AdventureMFDan for the five subs.
[242:13.66]Five community subs.

[243:29.87]Don't worry about it.

[246:45.67]I'm broken.
[246:46.39]I think I might be broken.
[246:48.50]Do you think you broke me?
[246:51.66]Divas, thank you for the 50 fucking dollars.
[246:57.39]Thank you.
[246:58.39]Hey, Jerma, wanted to ask you something that has been bothering me lately.
[247:01.12]Lately, I feel like I don't really have a purpose.
[247:04.63]in life other than just to live and be there for other people either that or I'm just living for dreams and opportunities that I know are never gonna happen but I keep giving it a chance as an excuse to live longer it's just so many expectations and pressure from other people and I don't know what to do with my own life and that's on top of depression and so much other shit and that's just one out of two
[247:26.11]I will tell you very, very, very much.
[247:28.37]I mentioned Labster 5 community subs.
[247:31.68]Thank you.
[247:32.74]I mentioned something not even five, ten minutes ago about if 18-year-old me could look into the future, they would think it was a lie.
[247:41.96]The thing about opportunity is you never know when it's going to happen.
[247:47.25]The reason why it is called opportunity is because it could just fucking happen and you'll never know.
[247:53.19]You just try to be ready for it.
[247:56.28]It doesn't matter if you're talking about something in work or relationship or school.
[248:02.40]There's no real way to prepare for it.
[248:06.77]I was not prepared for it.
[248:08.09]I was not ready for it.
[248:09.57]I was... Just like a lot of you fucking guys.
[248:14.91]All of you guys.
[248:16.49]When I was like 18, 19, 20, you know, you just kind of...
[248:19.76]You're just doing you.
[248:20.50]You're trying to figure out what you want to do into your 20s, into your 30s.
[248:23.80]You're just trying to figure out what the fuck you want to do.
[248:26.62]And sometimes an opportunity will knock and you just happen to do it and you can't really foresee that it's going to happen.
[248:37.11]But on top of that, though, there is no secret formula.
[248:41.56]I think people will ask, well, how did you do this?
[248:44.08]How do you do that?
[248:44.64]What's the secret?
[248:45.28]There really is no secret.
[248:47.66]It's just kind of passion.
[248:52.27]little a little bit of uh talent in the right areas a lot of luck you know that's what opportunity really kind of is is those uh handful of things and I really wish there was a way for me to tell you all the secrets and give you all these things and hey let me tell you this this is the exact thing you have to do with your life but I can't do that you know
[249:20.33]I can't give you the answers because I don't have them.
[249:26.05]As much as... Yeah, life is very complex.
[249:33.58]But to put a cap on something like that,
[249:40.52]try to find a few things that you like to do, a few things that you're good at, and just make your life however you can from those handful of things.
[249:51.68]Everybody's good at something.
[249:53.72]Everybody's good at fucking something.
[249:55.68]You just might not know what it is yet.
[249:57.94]And even if you do, work on it.
[250:07.68]All the time.
[250:12.65]A lot of people say, I'm not good at anything.
[250:15.89]Yes, you are.
[250:17.05]There's at least a handful of things that you could reliably do that you know that you can.
[250:22.85]And if you don't, if you really don't think you do, you might try to take up some more hobbies.
[250:30.49]Try to take up some more things that you might want to try to get better at.
[250:33.03]I wish I had the secrets.
[250:40.85]Everybody's good at something.
[250:45.37]You don't, here's another thing.
[250:47.55]You don't have to be an astronaut.
[250:49.58]You know what I mean?
[250:50.14]You don't have to be like a fucking personal chef.
[250:55.16]Like you don't, you can be whatever you're good at.
[251:00.04]Find it.
[251:01.24]You will.
[251:02.00]Soon enough.
[251:09.27]Keep gifting until he cries on stream.
[251:22.24]I'm good at not being noticed in chat.
[251:24.80]But again, I'm not an expert.
[251:27.12]I'm not qualified to have to tell you these things.
[251:30.58]This is just kind of stuff that I believe.
[251:41.49]But I want to be an astronaut.
[251:44.07]Go for it.
[251:44.81]Try it.
[251:46.26]Learn about space.
[251:47.64]Learn about all these things.
[251:49.28]Get into it.
[251:49.80]Get involved in community projects.
[251:51.54]Get involved with whatever NASA's got some shit, right?
[251:56.20]Get involved with it.
[251:57.52]Make it something that you care about every day.
[252:01.30]And if you are still doing well and you still like it and you're doing good, go for it.
[252:07.30]Just go to NASA.
[252:16.80]This is still going.
[252:23.58]TLDW.
[252:24.80]Too long.
[252:25.36]Didn't watch.
[252:31.15]You shape the person that you are in your late teens into your 20s.
[252:37.21]You think I knew what the fuck I was doing with my life even like six or seven years ago?
[252:41.01]Not even like 10 years ago.
[252:41.95]Not even.
[252:42.15]I'm 33.
[252:42.69]I'm 33.
[252:44.64]I don't think I had any goddamn idea what the hell I was doing when I was like 25.
[252:48.28]I was like... I wanted to do some... I was making wedding videos.
[252:59.64]And I kind of didn't really like it.
[253:01.80]I wasn't that great at it.
[253:03.78]I thought I was okay at it, but I just didn't... You know what I mean?
[253:05.90]Like, I didn't have any idea.
[253:09.71]A growing boomer.
[253:15.07]You shape the person that you are and the things that you know that you like and the things that you're good at from those teen years into your mid, early to mid into late 20s.
[253:26.69]That's what I believe.
[253:27.90]That's how I feel.
[253:30.76]You'll find it.
[253:33.22]Thank you.
[253:34.98]Thank you so much.
[253:36.68]And a ton more fucking money came in.
[253:44.71]Joe Dirt gave $50.
[253:46.01]Oh, my God.

[254:08.77]Thank you.
[254:13.16]I hope you feel that way.
[254:15.02]I'm just going to continue to try to do the things that I want to do.
[254:20.08]Thank you.
[254:31.59]Anyways, let's go and go back before this huge amount of money.
[254:39.66]And let's go talk about some of the other messages that we've received.
[254:42.50]And then Colonel Zero comes up with another $50.
[254:44.12]$50 from Colonel Zero.
[254:47.20]Thanks for making me happy and for giving me the pep talk to pick a new hobby.

[255:37.05]Uh, hot take alert.
[255:38.40]Thanks for the five community subs.

[256:05.43]Thank you, everybody.
[256:06.83]Thank you so fucking much.
[256:09.27]Let's continue after that.
[256:11.31]Oh my god.
[256:16.84]Thank you.
[256:18.68]Thank you, Solid Milk, for the $1.
[256:19.78]Hey again, Jerma.
[256:21.66]I spent $1.60 this week and I set myself back so far from a PC, so I'm just going to give my last of my bits.
[256:28.55]Make sure you take care of yourself first.
[256:30.61]It's very important.
[256:33.25]Very, very, very important.
[256:36.66]If you have some disposable, expendable income, and it's something that you'd like or that you want to do for yourself, do it for you first.
[256:44.50]I should be way, way down on that list of things that you want to give money to.
[256:50.27]If you still have some left over, sure, absolutely.
[256:54.61]But make sure you take care of your fucking self first.
[256:56.95]Take care of you first.
[257:00.44]Thank you.
[257:02.78]Dr. EpicFrag, thanks for the $1.
[257:06.23]When's the stream where we finish that one good item-finding game?
[257:12.97]Didn't somebody mention a better one?
[257:14.87]One that was more interesting?
[257:17.76]That we were going to take a look at in quotes?
[257:26.90]I spy.
[257:27.54]Okay.
[257:28.60]Yeah, we'll do it.
[257:29.86]Drawn Flats, thank you.
[257:31.54]$10 earlier.
[257:33.22]You're a great streamer.
[257:33.88]Thanks for all your content.
[257:34.78]Still brings a smile to my face.
[257:37.18]I'm fucking really happy that you think that.
[257:39.32]Thank you so much, Drawn Flats, for your huge amount of money.
[257:42.01]Thank you.
[257:44.83]Tim Allen is still here.
[257:46.79]There's so many.
[257:47.87]Vince, Ryan, thanks for the two bucks.
[257:49.71]Hey, Jim, I want to let you know that working on animation homework while listening to you yell stomach, head, stomach last night was like being in purgatory, but like in a fun way.
[258:04.40]Did somebody give even more?
[258:08.52]Tempered cucumber, $100.
[258:09.38]A hundred from tempered cucumber.
[258:12.84]Again, I am in $22,000 in debt now.
[258:19.98]I hope that's not true.
[258:22.66]I hope that's not true.
[258:24.26]Thank you though.
[258:29.66]Jerma debt.
[258:32.64]Thank you tempered cucumber so fucking much.
[258:38.78]Make sure you pay your bills and you pay your debts.
[258:41.32]Don't worry about giving me a fucking huge amount of money.
[258:48.06]I appreciate you fucking hanging out.
[258:49.70]Thank you.
[258:52.18]Oh my goodness gracious.
[258:55.32]I'm gonna do something with this money.
[258:57.98]When this payment comes in, you're gonna see some fucking... You're gonna see a fucking stream with this.
[259:08.13]Blow it all in Vegas!
[259:09.73]Why would I do such a thing?
[259:16.10]Take all the money from the last two days and put it all on black.
[259:21.64]No fucking way.
[259:23.96]No way.
[259:30.03]My god.
[259:32.97]Thank you to...
[259:42.83]I got lost here.
[259:43.77]There's been so much money.
[259:54.01]Thank you for $5 from Graveyard Ghoul.
[259:57.49]I found this on cropped boomer images and I feel like it perfectly sums up how you feel after beating Yell at Lady game.
[260:05.08]Cropped boomer images?
[260:08.78]I'm fucking tired.
[260:12.34]Hey, Zilly Writer, thanks for the $10.

[261:15.55]No.
[261:17.13]No, I can't.
[261:17.93]I can't do Smash Ultimate.
[261:20.45]It's too much for my fucking jermaOld brain.
[261:26.30]It's a great game, but I can't do it.
[261:28.94]I tried.
[261:30.88]Thank you, though.
[261:33.66]Thank you, Nick, for the $10.
[261:38.18]Hey, Jerma, a girl I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with ended our relationship tonight.
[261:42.57]But going on to Twitch and realizing you were streaming brought a smile to my face.
[261:46.29]You mean so much to me and the rest of your fans.
[261:48.25]Just want to let you know that we love you.
[261:53.52]I'm terribly sorry to hear that.
[261:57.74]That's always incredibly fucking difficult.
[262:00.42]Breakups are fucking hard.
[262:01.54]Oh, my God.
[262:05.21]Breakups are really fucking hard to do.
[262:07.85]And especially if you thought it was going to be something much more long-term.
[262:13.17]Take care of yourself.
[262:13.97]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[262:16.05]Glad you can hang out here and have some fun.
[262:23.24]Thank you.
[262:25.14]I wish you the best.
[262:28.75]Another $100.
[262:30.11]Did another $100 just come in?
[262:35.15]Or was that from... Is this thing... Is this thing just counting from like fucking an hour ago?
[262:48.37]Ben, another 50 from Ben.
[262:49.87]This stream is not serendipity.
[262:51.52]You deserve every penny, my man.
[262:53.34]Thanks for getting me through law school.
[262:58.10]Lawyer.
[262:59.86]Law school.
[263:01.52]I told you that there's a ton of smart fucking cookies here.
[263:09.75]Don't you guys know all of my viewers are either doctors, lawyers, astronauts?
[263:15.57]So that's great to hear.
[263:18.59]Thank you so much for the $50.
[263:19.39]You guys are fucking great.
[263:25.20]Thank you.
[263:25.90]Thank you fucking Ben so much for the hundreds of fucking dollars.
[263:29.78]Thank you.
[263:32.22]We also had some come in from... Look at all these.
[263:36.97]I'm scrolling through hundreds of fucking community subs.
[263:41.15]Hundreds of them.
[263:43.73]I can't even tell where they begin or where they end.
[263:57.84]Is this too much?
[264:01.62]Holy shit.
[264:04.34]This is too much.
[264:09.00]New account, thank you for the five dollars.
[264:11.77]Hey, Jerma, just wanted to tell you about a year ago today.
[264:13.67]No, no, sorry.
[264:16.63]That's a different message.
[264:18.39]It scrolled up right when I read it.
[264:19.73]But that new account, thanks for the $5.
[264:22.19]What's the ETA of Jerma Rumble Live Action 2?
[264:24.05]That's going to get me.
[264:31.23]Hey, thanks.
[264:31.99]Thanks a lot.
[264:34.64]That was from an hour ago.
[264:36.24]An hour ago.
[264:37.34]That means it has an hour to catch up.
[264:42.40]Oh my fucking god.
[264:49.40]I don't have an ETA on it.
[264:50.72]There's no ETA ever on anything that I ever try to plan.
[264:52.93]So you'll see it eventually.
[264:54.91]John Horns, thanks for the two bucks.
[264:56.69]Hey Jerm, any probability of a Crash Insane Trilogy stream?
[265:04.16]Probably not.
[265:05.54]Probably not.
[265:13.53]There's an overwhelming amount of money here.
[265:22.03]I don't even know what to say.
[265:22.81]There's like thousands of dollars in bits and messages and...
[265:54.96]Hold on, I need to open this back up.
[266:01.04]Where is that fucking... Okay, hold on.
[266:13.11]The messages and the bits were coming in so fast that I actually have to load up the other page.
[266:20.66]So let me see where we were.
[266:29.05]I think we were right here.
[266:31.76]Holy shit.
[266:35.00]Hydrate.
[266:35.80]I need to hydrate.
[266:36.66]You're right.
[266:40.12]I'm still alive.
[266:40.82]I'm still here.
[266:41.38]Don't worry.
[266:41.78]Let me see how much is left.
[266:53.57]There are probably hundreds of messages here.
[267:10.46]Holy fucking god.
[267:17.26]Yeah, there's so many more messages and so many more bits.
[267:27.92]You guys are fucking... You guys are unbelievable.
[267:31.20]I don't even know what to do.
[267:31.98]I don't even know what to say.
[267:49.79]This was gonna be just a little end of the... end of the stream thing.
[267:53.71]50 bucks.
[268:02.02]Just came in right now.
[268:07.94]From... No, it didn't.
[268:11.48]I have to like turn off Streamlabs, I think.
[268:23.70]Good thing you announced it as a hangout.
[268:25.34]That's true.
[268:30.02]I'm gonna go get some water.
[268:31.46]So give... Give me just a moment.
[268:37.31]I will return very shortly.
[268:38.73]Just gonna get some water.
[268:41.41]Be right back.
[269:07.62]Thank you.
[269:40.68]Thank you.
[271:32.02]He's crying off stream.
[271:33.54]No, I'm right here.
[271:36.16]For the purposes of trying to get through this extreme amount of money and messages and donations and everything.
[271:42.05]It's an overwhelming amount of money.
[271:45.25]I'm just going to try to go through them and thank everybody.
[271:53.06]Let me move this.
[272:02.66]Where even is this?
[272:04.78]Oh.
[272:08.01]Okay.
[272:10.51]So for the purposes of getting through this, thank you everybody.
[272:15.79]We're going to go through them.
[272:20.86]I'm not going to skip any bits, but this is probably gonna take another two to three plus hours to go through these.
[272:33.76]It's a lot.
[272:35.34]It's an un-fucking-believable amount.
[272:44.49]Did he put in eyedrops?
[272:45.69]No.
[272:49.09]So let's see if we can get through these in one stream.
[272:57.01]Thank you to... Thank you to Lando Bando for the dollar.
[273:00.96]Hey, I'm the guy who wrote the drive-through story.
[273:03.00]This is important.
[273:04.02]What's your review of the story?
[273:05.10]This is a... It was a solid... It was a solid, I didn't do it.
[273:12.51]But no, it was very well written.
[273:15.73]Storyline.
[273:17.39]Thank you Lando Bando for the one dollar.
[273:18.79]Thank you so much.
[273:20.21]Cosmic Moses.

[273:26.49]Alright, how about this?
[273:28.71]You ready?
[273:30.31]I 100% guarantee, clip this so you know, that this time, by this time next week, on the day of Jeremy's death, I don't like to even say that.
[273:45.48]I don't.
[273:45.76]I'm just going to say the 23rd.
[273:48.14]Okay.
[273:48.34]Okay, the goalie stream, where I'm dressed up as a goalie.
[273:51.01]Uh-huh.

[274:05.30]My audio cut out.
[274:09.95]Song?
[274:10.77]I'll be singing a song.
[274:12.99]Song.
[274:14.09]It keeps cutting out on me.
[274:16.67]Wearing song?
[274:19.89]The audio keeps cutting out.
[274:20.93]Sorry, thanks for that, though.
[274:21.93]Sorry, I don't know what's going on there.
[274:24.03]Thanks for the $1.
[274:25.93]Thank you, holo1zombie, for the $1.

[274:33.01]Acting.
[274:35.20]I'm an actor.
[274:36.14]You've seen me in such things as made-up stuff on my IMDb page that people have a lot of fun with.
[274:43.29]Don't do that, by the way.
[274:44.09]It's not alright.
[274:44.67]You can't do that.
[274:45.41]That's against the rules.
[274:48.21]Thank you, Whole of One Zombie.
[274:50.62]Thank you, probably, at least, again, for the $1.
[274:53.80]Thanks for being wholesome.

[276:57.99]Once upon a time and another time, he was right here, you know?
[277:03.65]Willem Dafoe studies a portrait of Jerma.
[277:08.22]And I see the marks, you know?
[277:11.06]I laugh when people say, you look like him.
[277:13.96]He looks very different.
[277:15.89]It's a remarkable close encounter.
[277:18.11]That's fucking great.
[277:38.79]That was really good.
[277:39.63]It was very good.

[278:13.03]Also, thank you to Lanead for the $10.
[278:15.85]I've been watching you for a long time, Jerma.
[278:17.51]Just want to tell you that you seem like someone that gives super good high fives.
[278:21.41]Nope, I missed and I just hurt my hand.
[278:23.92]So you were wrong.
[278:26.10]I'll miss every time.
[278:28.76]Thank you for the $10.
[278:30.24]Timmy Tim Tam, thanks for the $1.
[278:31.46]Okay, so you said a little bit about politics earlier and I don't really want to bring that back up, but what's your favorite Pringles flavor?
[278:39.10]It's not pizza.
[278:39.72]It's not sour cream.
[278:40.45]It's not cheddar.
[278:41.33]It's not original.
[278:42.01]Original is the worst.
[278:42.67]Original is disgusting.
[278:44.01]My favorite Pringles flavor is... Can I get a drum roll, please?
[279:25.79]I can't remember the last time I actually ate Pringles.
[279:28.23]I don't think I know.
[279:32.69]I actually don't know.
[279:33.73]I haven't eaten Pringles in like fucking four years.
[279:41.03]I don't know.
[279:43.05]I'm sure I liked one.
[279:45.82]You still, I'm still here, yeah.
[279:46.92]I'm good.
[279:47.52]I was just searching.
[279:48.44]I was going, look, my brain is in hard drive from like 2001.
[279:51.01]Something, you know, like that.
[279:52.81]I have to search through the records.
[279:57.24]Thank you, Dinky Duper.
[279:59.48]for the $1.
[280:00.28]Hey, Jerma, you seem like pretty good with advice, so I was wondering if you could help me.
[280:03.50]You could say I'm one of those, I guess, melodramatic fools.
[280:07.01]You could even say neurotic to the bone, so doubt about it.
[280:09.79]Sometimes I get myself the creeps, and sometimes my mind plays tricks on me.
[280:12.39]It just keeps adding up.
[280:13.37]I feel like I'm cracking up.
[280:14.09]I'm just paranoid.
[280:14.61]Am I just... It's Green Day.

[283:17.06]Uh, burgers, by the way, thanks for the $3.
[283:18.70]I'm still waiting for my Nvidia swag bag.
[283:20.92]I used the code FATFUCK and I still haven't gotten it.
[283:23.74]That's not my, that's not on me.
[283:25.22]That's, uh, that's not on me.
[283:28.10]That's on the company, you know.
[283:29.90]Thanks for the $1, Superintendent Chalmers.
[283:31.54]Raid Vinny, haha.
[283:34.40]Uh, we'll take a look and see who's going here still.
[283:37.66]When we get to the end of these bits here.
[283:40.26]Hey, Gray, thank you, Grave, for the $9.47.
[283:42.08]Hey, Jerm.
[283:44.51]Will that shirt you put on during the New Year's stream, the Fireman shirt, will that ever be some kind of merch?
[283:49.12]I'd absolutely wear that in public.
[283:51.38]The shirt is currently purchasable from the Jackbox app thing.
[283:56.54]It's like a website.
[283:57.96]As for Fireman merch, everything is a possibility.
[284:02.36]But I really don't want to load up a shitload of shirts.
[284:06.57]Like, for instance, there was like three or four shirts.
[284:09.56]Oh yeah, hey, by the way, tomorrow it's 20 bucks a shirt and it's like five of them.
[284:15.09]I'd rather trickle out stuff like that and not just dump out like three or four pieces of merchandise at once.
[284:21.48]So everything is open.
[284:23.62]Everything's up for the future.
[284:25.66]I can't tell you exactly, but it's been talked about.
[284:32.22]Mostly lost, thanks for the $1.
[284:33.40]That poster art reminded me, since I have no idea what Boo actually looks like, I just imagine he looks like the guy he voiced in Rat Movie.
[284:44.25]He might.
[284:44.99]You never know.
[284:45.83]He might look just like that guy from Rat Movie.
[284:50.87]Demonicucumber, thanks for the $1.
[284:52.19]I don't think any of my bits came up today, which is a shame, because I made a really good joke about today actually being the death of the main channel.
[285:07.44]It's a pretty good joke.
[285:10.02]Pretty good joke.
[285:12.66]Hey, Superman, thanks for the $1.
[285:14.28]It is a YouTube link.
[285:20.55]It's Celeryman.
[285:21.27]We've already talked about Celeryman.
[285:23.23]We've seen Celeryman with Paul Rudd.
[285:26.39]Thank you, Superman, for the $1 and the Celeryman.
[285:30.13]Dork Cube, thanks for the $1.
[285:31.55]LinkedIn, here's Ron.
[285:35.40]Here's the Ron Troutman's, the cheers to you guys, LinkedIn.
[285:41.66]I don't want to.
[285:51.69]No, that's okay.
[285:55.99]Thank you for the $1.
[285:59.10]Thank you mostly lost for the one doll.
[286:01.02]This is the stream where people actively dislike being gifted nice things streamer included I Don't think it's it's not that it's about dislike it's about It's just kind of one of those overwhelming things That you never really prepared for as much as I can try to look like and pretend like I am otherwise If that makes any sense
[286:27.10]Thank you for the $1, though, Most of the Lost.
[286:28.46]I really appreciate it.
[286:30.04]Thank you, Jules, for the $1.
[286:32.10]Thank you, HackItFast, for the $1.
[286:33.40]Am I going to PAX East this year?
[286:35.04]I am not going to PAX East.
[286:37.53]I don't think it's in the cards.
[286:39.65]Something on this side of the United States, probably.
[286:43.45]But not PAX East.
[286:44.69]I don't think I'll be able to make it.
[286:50.15]Thank you, Most of the Lost, for the $1.
[286:51.54]I love how you were saying, I don't want there to be any incentives for subbing while chat was in sub-only mode.
[286:57.76]Well, chat goes into sub-only mode sometimes when there's a problem or there's a reason for it to go on.
[287:02.82]It's not on.
[287:04.58]It's on maybe for a couple minutes, maybe.
[287:08.99]Sub-only mode is like a way to potentially help or corral when there's an issue.
[287:16.25]It's not paying to... The chat is open almost 100% of the time.
[287:21.87]So...
[287:24.98]That's not going to happen.
[287:25.90]I'm not going to turn on sub only mode forever.
[287:28.56]It's just only there for very specific reasons, right?
[287:33.51]When it gets too gassy.
[287:34.81]It's a good way to put it.
[287:39.41]Thanks for the $1, and that's why the face came.
[287:41.21]I don't like having it on because you see me do, like, fucking quelled burps.
[287:44.78]It's great.
[287:46.58]TechnoToast, thanks for the $1.
[287:47.84]Jerma, I can honestly genuinely say that you're one of my favorite streamers and YouTubers ever.
[287:51.44]You deserve all the subs and more because I know you'll put it towards amazing uses and make even more ambitious, entertaining streams.
[287:58.27]Love you, my dude.
[287:58.83]I'm gonna try.
[288:02.31]I'm gonna try.
[288:02.93]That's all I can do, is try.
[288:07.98]But thank you so much.
[288:09.02]Thank you WeeThan for the four dollars.
[288:11.36]Jerma, glad to see that switching to Twitch has worked out so well for you.
[288:14.02]Keep up the good work.
[288:17.53]It's been great.
[288:19.33]Twitch has been incredibly kind to me, so it's great.
[288:24.71]I couldn't be happier, so thank you.
[288:28.91]Goopsnatch, thanks for the ten dollars.
[288:31.83]Already subbed, so I thought I'd give you more money.
[288:33.91]Thanks for being a funny dummy.
[288:37.94]Funny dummy.
[288:41.22]Thank you, Goop.
[288:42.60]Really appreciate it.
[288:44.08]Thanks for the $10.
[288:46.18]No soup for you.
[288:46.85]Thanks for the $1.
[288:47.57]So when do we get to play Twitch Plays the Stock Market with all this money?
[288:52.01]I would not do something like that.
[288:56.07]We would lose that account.
[288:57.65]That account would go to zero in probably fucking three days.
[289:02.82]Thank you, Tagora, for the five community subs.
[289:07.49]Tagore, five community subs on top of the fucking hundreds that have happened today.
[289:12.15]The last 24 hours.
[289:14.87]IvkazTV, thanks for the five dollars.
[289:16.81]Dear my friend, it's been some time.
[289:18.56]Remember me.
[289:19.26]Hope you have a wonderful day and thank you for all you do for everyone.
[289:22.48]And they have the party, the party popper thing going pop, pop, pop.
[289:27.40]Thank you, Ivkaz.
[289:29.12]Thank you for the five dollars.
[289:32.10]And welcome back to the stream.
[289:34.80]Where were you?
[289:39.61]At this point, not being a sub is an anomaly here.
[289:43.76]Yeah.
[289:45.24]Yeah.
[289:49.12]It's wild to think about that.
[289:51.31]Robbie Revolver, thanks for the $1.
[289:52.81]Congrats, Jerma.
[289:55.25]Congrats, thank you.
[289:57.23]Killaganon, $1 from Killaganon.
[289:58.79]We wanna thank you for all your hard work.
[290:00.67]You're the one who steps things up and gets things done around here.
[290:04.17]You keep your word, you deliver what you promise, and then you go the extra mile.
[290:09.82]You're doing a great job.
[290:11.56]A great job.
[290:15.94]10 more fucking community subs.
[290:19.72]What the hell is happening?
[290:24.78]Fly4Shy, thanks for 10 community subs.
[290:29.86]Thank you.
[290:30.85]For 10 fucking more subs.
[290:36.51]DrEpicFrag, thanks for a dollar.
[290:38.19]Our big boy is gonna cry.
[290:40.11]I think we're breaking him.
[290:42.29]No.
[290:45.49]I'm alright.
[290:46.82]NoobKing, thanks for $3.
[290:48.08]It's my birthday.
[290:48.72]Thanks for the great stream.
[290:49.48]Happy birthday, NoobKing.
[290:51.34]Happy birthday to you.
[290:52.96]To you.
[290:54.81]Spuds, thanks for the $1.25 spuds.
[290:56.69]I can't sub, but you can have these ad bits.
[290:59.65]Smiley face, love you.
[291:02.47]The fact that anybody would have ad bits and watch ads and give the money to me is... Thank you.
[291:11.11]Thanks for fucking suffering through ads to give me money.
[291:16.24]And then Health Packs, five community subs from Health Packs.
[291:21.84]These gifted subs.
[291:25.37]I don't even know what to say anymore.
[291:26.81]It's fucking... It's remarkable.
[291:28.39]It's great.
[291:29.22]It's... You guys are paying for literally everything.
[291:33.86]You're taking fucking such good goddamn care of me.
[291:36.12]I don't even know what to say.
[291:45.46]Ads.
[291:47.44]jermaPluto.
[291:48.56]Ads.
[291:50.53]Uh...
[291:52.34]I'd ever agree thanks for the five dollars I'd hey Jerm I've been watching your streams for a long time you never fail to make me laugh till my stomach hurts also have you checked out a game called oxen free I have not heard of oxen free oxen free what's it about a thriller about a group of friends
[292:22.26]It's a thriller about a group of friends who unwittingly open a ghostly rift.
[292:31.20]Just bookmark it.
[292:34.72]Bookmarked.
[292:36.04]We'll look at that.
[292:37.86]See if it's worth something that's fun to do.
[292:40.30]I have now looked at it.
[292:42.68]So I'll give it a closer look.
[292:45.95]Yeah, I mean, no one's expected to fucking just give that much money in that short amount of time.
[292:49.39]Tons of you guys have
[293:13.93]given like $10, $5, $1, $2 every single stream.
[293:19.93]It adds up a lot.
[293:20.83]It adds up over time to a point where you have given potentially hundreds of dollars over the years.
[293:35.43]Bottom left.
[293:37.91]What's in the bottom left?
[293:40.35]It's a pillow with duct tape on it.
[293:45.46]Yeah, if you're just joining us, I finished Lifeline.
[293:50.24]And there were a lot of messages and a lot of bits and stuff that I didn't read from yesterday.
[293:54.94]And I'm just kind of going through the massive amount of bits and subs and donations that were given over the last 48 hours.
[294:02.55]So we're just kind of channing it up for a while, just chilling out.
[294:07.59]What chat am I reading from?
[294:08.77]What?
[294:11.01]What are you talking about?
[294:18.21]Hangout stream.
[294:19.01]I too like to hang out with my friends by watching us shower money on one lucky friend for five hours straight.
[294:28.29]Well, two.
[294:28.97]Because we... I beat the lifeline.
[294:35.59]I beat lifeline at about three and a half to four hours in.
[294:39.92]Sounds like my kind of party.
[294:45.88]My 3,000 friends.
[294:48.77]Watching us give one person money.
[294:54.17]But this doesn't happen that often.
[294:57.78]This is an anomaly for sure.
[294:59.84]This is a lot of fucking money and a lot of messages over the last couple of days.
[295:03.80]This does not happen all the time.
[295:06.06]So I obviously want to give the attention that I think it deserves.
[295:11.42]But we are getting there.
[295:12.50]Not very much left.
[295:16.95]Not like a... It's probably not going to take more than an hour or so.
[295:22.05]But this is also another conversation to have.
[295:24.71]Because... A part of me does not want to have this conversation.
[295:31.63]But... Kind of have to at some point.
[295:36.00]If...
[295:37.63]Remember how when we used to be, it was 25 cents and I would read everything, right?
[295:44.75]And then we moved that to a dollar and I'm still trying to read as much as I can.
[295:50.03]What happens is when there's so many people giving money and so many people donating and it becomes hard to do this with a channel that is growing at the size that we are.
[296:08.70]So with a $1 minimum, it actually... As much as I don't want to say this, and I'm not sure I'm ready to do it yet.
[296:19.87]The threshold may have to increase.
[296:23.59]It might have to.
[296:25.07]For the end of the streams.
[296:28.95]$50 minimum?
[296:29.69]What the hell are you talking about?
[296:30.87]No way!
[296:34.36]I wanted to wait as long as I could.
[296:36.70]I wanted to see how, how far it could go.
[296:40.16]But when there's, when there's this many people, it just, it becomes nearly impossible.
[296:50.69]You know, sometimes the end of the streams will be two, three plus potentially hours long, and that's why we moved it in the first place.
[297:02.23]$10 to $15?
[297:02.71]No, no, it wouldn't be that high.
[297:10.14]It would not be more than that.
[297:11.82]Not in a million years.
[297:18.48]But that's just kind of what happens when there's this much to read.
[297:25.25]And I want to give everybody the attention that they deserve, but the stream needs to function too.
[297:31.55]That's been one of my biggest philosophies with doing streaming and Twitch and everything is having a stream that is a stream.
[297:40.66]And that's why I stopped reading stuff in the middle of the stream.
[297:45.00]That's why I moved it to the end so we could kind of have a little session where we hang out.
[297:51.17]I'm going to think about what it would possibly be.
[297:56.62]I need to buy the season pass.
[297:58.20]No, it's just for end of the stream messages.
[298:01.30]To make it easier for us to read them so it doesn't potentially go on for hours at a time.
[298:05.23]I don't like that fucking sound.
[298:13.29]But, for the purposes of this stream... The One Guy VIP DLC.
[298:24.28]No.
[298:29.71]But let's keep going.
[298:31.65]Just figured I would bring it up.
[298:33.59]Been sort of keeping that in here for a while because I didn't want to really talk about it because I didn't want to bring it up because I didn't want to do it.
[298:42.08]But sometimes it's necessary.
[298:45.00]As much as it pains me to say.
[298:47.56]But thank you, Kilgenin, for the $1.
[298:50.54]We want to thank you for all your hard work.
[298:52.34]Oh, that's just the fucking cheers to you, guy.
[298:57.01]We got that already.
[298:59.03]Uh, Dr. EpicFrag, thanks for the $1.
[299:00.91]Our big boy is crying.
[299:01.95]We're breaking him.
[299:02.61]Why are these popping up twice?
[299:03.69]Didn't we get... We got them, right?
[299:09.56]Uh, happy birthday to NoobKing.
[299:10.76]We got NoobKing, right?
[299:15.66]Uh, some of these are coming back.
[299:18.39]Hey, HeyHeatMizer, thanks for the $5.
[299:20.83]Kind of broke because I'm in high school, but I can't fucking wait to see what you do with all this.
[299:25.05]So cool to see you doing this.
[299:26.07]Well, Jerma, love you.
[299:33.44]We'll see.
[299:35.02]I have a few projects in mind that I think this money would do very well in, so I will use it.
[299:39.91]I'll put it to good use.
[299:41.95]SpaceButterfly, thanks for the $10.
[299:43.57]Thank you for your fantastic streams, Jermo.
[299:44.99]You're one of the funniest, most genuine guys on the internet, and you deserve all the money you earn.
[299:50.48]Really appreciate that, SpaceButterfly.
[299:52.04]Thank you for the $10.
[299:52.94]TheAcesChase, thanks for $10.
[299:55.20]I got a community sub right now letting me be subscribed for the first time to any streamer.
[300:00.93]Wow.
[300:02.49]And I don't have money to gift subs in return, but I got a few free bits that I want to give you.
[300:10.59]Thank you.
[300:13.69]First time to any streamer, a sub.
[300:16.16]Aces Chase, thank you for the $10.
[300:17.12]And thanks for... Thanks for being here.
[300:22.64]Solid gold bathroom.
[300:25.58]I got the solid gold.
[300:27.68]On either side.
[300:28.80]The toilet is going to be the cheapest one at Home Depot.
[300:35.80]But thank you, Ace.
[300:37.92]Dr. Epic Frag, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[300:39.40]Here, Jeremy, buy yourself a pizza pie on me.
[300:43.47]$18, actually, from Dr. Epic Frag.
[300:45.47]Thank you.
[300:47.21]I will buy a pizza very soon, within the next few days.
[300:51.62]And I'll be thinking about Dr. Epic Frag when I eat it.
[300:56.04]Salt gold toilet water.
[300:58.07]Thank you, Berga, by the way, for the $2.
[301:00.09]Keep it rolling.
[301:01.83]We are.
[301:02.79]Thank you.
[301:04.09]Otto Heinz, thanks for the $1.
[301:05.23]I've been watching you since 2015.
[301:06.93]You've been one of the content creators who I've enjoyed.
[301:09.43]Always.
[301:10.37]Consistently make me laugh.
[301:12.09]I'd like to give more, but I need to save some cash since I'm in school.
[301:15.09]Keep it up.
[301:16.24]Keep up the school.
[301:18.22]Save your money.
[301:20.24]Save it up to buy a gold bathroom.
[301:22.04]Because that's what I'm doing.
[301:25.32]Hey, Glyphbin, thanks for the $4.
[301:26.82]Jerma Rumble live action turned out to be a brilliant investment.
[301:29.12]Good call.
[301:30.82]And as you're aware of the amount of money that we're making here now, the amount of money that I have now going to be in my bank account this year, that was like almost $10,000 to do Jerma Rumble Live 1.
[301:45.25]Imagine what the fuck is possible with like $30,000.
[301:57.42]I got some fucking ideas.
[302:00.53]Your accountant is gonna go through hell.
[302:08.09]Don't waste it all on one video?
[302:09.41]Nah, I'm just obviously pulling out random numbers, but...
[302:16.67]I'm going to use it.
[302:18.19]I'm going to use it.
[302:19.17]Thank you, Glyphbin.
[302:20.77]Again, for $4.
[302:22.36]Hey, Divis, thanks for the $2 on top of that huge amount of money from earlier.
[302:27.38]I don't want to make this feel like a therapy session, but do you have any advice?
[302:31.55]We talked about it for a little while.
[302:34.37]Hopefully you can get it sorted out.
[302:39.01]We extensively went over it.
[302:41.33]If you're still here, Divas, hopefully you were there when we talked about it.
[302:45.25]Thank you so much for the two bucks and the huge amount of money before that.
[302:49.55]And also thanks to Starwolf.
[302:51.46]Starwolf Ken for $1.
[302:52.76]Give until he gets mad.
[302:56.70]Why would I ever get mad from someone giving me money?
[303:01.46]Mad?
[303:02.60]No.
[303:04.68]No, I wouldn't get mad at that.
[303:08.40]banned bro like but that was I was just trying to it was a joke though that was not for real I was just trying to say that he gave a lot of money very quickly and I and I mean I'm I'm looking at the shit that you guys are writing right now everybody everybody everybody's doing the fucking rage mutant thing the sun the sun yeah fuming because booming
[303:37.35]Thank you, Lelimo, for the $5.
[303:38.75]Hey, Jerma, been watching for around two years and have never donated, so now seems like a good time.
[303:44.19]Seems trite to say at this point, but your streams and videos have helped me at my lowest.
[303:47.49]Love you, bud.
[303:50.38]Thank you.
[303:52.92]It's a lot of positivity here.
[303:55.30]A lot of positive shit, which is great.
[303:59.32]You know, there's not very much negativity.
[304:04.70]At least I don't believe so.
[304:07.11]And it's really, really great to see all this positive stuff.
[304:11.50]Thank you, Lelimo, for the $5 and your incredibly nice message.
[304:16.32]Thank you, Brandingy.
[304:18.36]Brandingy for $10.
[304:19.82]Hey, Jerm, I've watched since 2013 and you've brought a lot of joy into my life.
[304:22.88]You really do put a lot into your stream and I think we appreciate what you do.
[304:28.40]I'm glad.
[304:30.74]Thank you.
[304:32.69]Thank you, Future Gamer, for the $1.
[304:34.66]You deserve every goddamn cent.
[304:35.80]You're the best streamer on Twitch.
[304:37.64]And it has been amazing watching you grow from some sort of shitty TF2 videos to having the first live... Truly amazing.
[304:50.61]The first live... I didn't... I'm fine.
[304:52.93]I didn't... I'm still here.
[304:58.16]Thank you, Future Gamer.
[305:01.11]Leather Jacket!
[305:01.71]10 bucks from Leather Jacket!
[305:02.75]Are we having a Give Jerma Money party?
[305:05.75]Seriously though, all this generosity, you deserve it all.
[305:08.73]Honored to wield a sword for the chat for all these years.
[305:11.14]Thank you.
[305:17.94]Fucking honored to have you here.
[305:23.06]That was Leather Jacket for $10.
[305:26.74]One of the first mods!
[305:28.63]One of the first mods on the channel that was Leather Jacket for 10 bucks.
[305:32.95]And then that was Future Gamer before that.
[305:36.47]Thank you.
[305:38.57]You guys are fucking awesome.
[305:40.29]And just so everybody realizes that we are getting close to the end, I'm gonna put on the outro.
[305:44.58]Because I don't really... I'd rather not have people stumble into the stream and just be like, what's going on in here?
[305:49.88]This guy's just like, accepting payments and... You know what I mean?
[305:56.08]I don't want people to think that, uh... End of the stream music.
[306:02.00]Uh, where is it?
[306:04.44]There we go.
[306:07.80]I literally just got here, see?
[306:09.38]So... There you go.
[306:13.40]Payment stream.
[306:14.48]Yeah, but I don't... That's not... You know what I mean?
[306:17.54]That's not... That's not... You know what I'm saying?
[306:23.89]Cheeseburger, thanks for the $7.
[306:25.33]Here's all my biddies.
[306:26.89]I'll take them, thank you.
[306:29.54]Uh, Five Tiger, thanks for the $5.
[306:33.18]Jerma Face Tat, thanks for the $5.
[306:34.78]Uh, Shrapnel, thanks for the $10, Shrapnel.
[306:41.64]Hey, Jerma.
[306:42.07]Uh...
[306:45.04]Love you.
[306:45.44]Thanks for these real talks at the end of the stream sometimes.
[306:48.60]Hearing you say some motivational things in your way means so much to me.
[306:52.21]Hope you have a good night.
[306:53.01]Also, love all of chat.
[306:57.47]Yeah.
[306:57.75]How can you not love chat?
[306:58.61]I mean, when they say fucking Boomer, you know, you kind of want to like, Hey!
[307:05.93]But, you know.
[307:07.03]Thank you, Shrapnel.
[307:09.11]Clink, thanks for the $15.
[307:10.39]Jerma isn't going to be the one crying.
[307:12.31]I am.
[307:17.86]Don't cry.
[307:18.26]You don't have to.
[307:19.43]You don't have to cry.
[307:22.81]But thanks for the $15 anyways, Clink.
[307:25.13]It's a lot of money.
[307:27.87]Thank you, Shinjo.
[307:30.55]Thank you, Shinji-no, for the $4.60.
[307:34.61]Been watching since 2012.
[307:37.17]Your stuff has always been a highlight when I see it.
[307:39.41]I hope you can keep doing this for the rest of your life, because I'll be right there with you.
[307:43.80]I'm going to do it as long as I can and as long as I'm still having a good time and as long as I'm still interested.
[307:49.25]If I'm still interested, you will see me forever.
[307:53.63]But I have to keep myself interested.
[307:56.52]Thank you.
[307:57.86]I appreciate that long-term dedicated support there.
[308:01.68]Thank you.
[308:01.98]That means a lot.
[308:03.50]MrShadowMan, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[308:04.94]Hey Jerma, according to Twitch stats, you have more subs than top streamers like Toofoo and Ninja.
[308:11.26]I do not have more subs than- I don't think either one of those.
[308:15.62]I don't- I don't think that that's real.
[308:17.60]Whatever website you're looking at, it's- it is definitely not correct.
[308:23.12]But, uh, just search for sub counts.
[308:27.60]Nah, that's not- that's not- no, no, no.
[308:29.50]No way.
[308:35.05]I don't have that many subs.
[308:39.09]Number one streamer.
[308:44.35]No.
[308:46.24]But.
[308:47.58]Also, this first time I've cheered.
[308:48.66]Hope it works.
[308:49.26]It worked, Mr. Shadow Man.
[308:52.54]Thank you for the $10.
[308:55.08]And thanks for thinking that I've got some of the most subs on the site.
[308:59.33]But I don't think I do.
[309:00.99]I have a fucking lot, though.
[309:03.64]Uh, Natty, thanks for the $15, Natty.
[309:06.86]Just a heart.
[309:08.18]No message.
[309:09.50]Fifteen bucks, thank you.
[309:11.10]Stuart Sinnott, thanks for the five bucks.
[309:13.14]Thanks for making me laugh.
[309:15.18]Keep up the good shit.
[309:19.47]Thank you, Stuart.
[309:21.19]Clueless Sniper, thanks for the one dollar.
[309:23.09]Jerma died and went to heaven, where he receives a never-ending supply of bits.
[309:29.20]Dr. Steen, $1.
[309:30.24]Hire an actor to be you on stream for five hours.
[309:32.34]No jokes.
[309:32.86]That's the whole stream.
[309:33.62]Even have him end it the same way.
[309:36.22]We thought about... We were in the chat, in the pre-stream chat, like a few weeks ago, and we were coming up with stupid ideas like that.
[309:42.94]And I think somebody said, hire an actor to be you.
[309:46.20]And then it was like just a British person, like a British actor.
[309:49.78]That looks like me.
[309:51.68]And it's just a full-on, like, just English accent.
[309:54.60]It looks like me.
[309:55.18]It's just a British actor.
[309:57.61]Like, not even close.
[309:58.27]Like, why would I even... Why would I do that?
[310:00.77]But, that would be funny.
[310:03.07]Maybe one day.
[310:04.25]I just come in, and I, like, fucking, like, point to a couple things, and I leave with, like, a plate of food.
[310:08.95]I'm, like, I'm watching downstairs.
[310:10.92]I'm watching the stream, just, like, hanging out, eating.
[310:12.64]That'd be kind of funny.
[310:17.34]Uh, Ryant Deloration, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[310:21.96]This is for people who want to donate, but can't.
[310:25.88]And then there's a cheeseburger.
[310:29.16]Thank you for the 10 bucks and thank you for paying for people that can't do it.
[310:35.38]When no one's ever expected to pay.
[310:37.46]Which is why stuff like this sometimes is fucking wild.
[310:43.61]We don't do this very often.
[310:44.67]I don't just sit here for like four hours and talk about money and... But... When shit like this does happen... I just...
[310:58.17]I'm glad you all fucking find it fun to be here.
[311:01.18]Ow, my whole hand.
[311:02.50]I went like, I put my hand down like this onto like the spike that's on the desk.
[311:09.40]I mean, you kind of do.
[311:11.60]Yeah, but at the end of a stream... If I stream for six, seven hours, and then we do this, then yeah.
[311:20.44]But this stream really has been a majority of this.
[311:24.86]So...
[311:26.69]You know, if I stream for six or seven hours straight and then there's like an hour or two of this, then that's a little different.
[311:35.09]He slapped him.
[311:35.81]Why is there a spike on the desk?
[311:37.74]It's part of my monitor.
[311:39.64]It's something broke right here and there's like a spike there.
[311:42.70]But... I got like a chest bubble.
[311:48.39]Okay.
[311:49.67]Okay.
[311:50.88]Uh, Never Trust a Purple, thanks for $20, Never Trust a Purple.
[311:54.18]Haven't been around much in the last few months.
[311:56.40]I've been going through a lot of upheaval in my personal life and a lot.
[311:59.01]Kind of lost a sense of direction.
[312:00.95]Uh, sometimes there are so many choices as to what you can do, it's impossible.
[312:04.19]You just have to pick one and just go and see what happens.
[312:09.05]That's a great way to put it.
[312:12.25]Sometimes you just pick one and just go.
[312:13.71]Yeah.
[312:16.27]Yeah.
[312:18.47]We're just humans.
[312:20.61]We're just a couple of humans.
[312:22.11]You don't get that much time, right?
[312:24.39]You've got this time.
[312:26.64]This never-stopping, always-moving thing.
[312:30.58]Try something.
[312:32.64]We're just a couple of humans.
[312:33.70]That's all that is.
[312:36.60]Pop the chest bubble.
[312:39.08]Rudolph, thanks for the $1.
[312:40.18]Don't you hate it when a sentence doesn't end how you... They wrote testicles at the end here.
[312:45.64]Thank you.
[312:46.04]Thank you Lando Bando for the $1.
[312:47.64]Hey, I'm back.
[312:48.28]Thought you would be sick of stories of anxiety and stuff.
[312:52.01]No.
[312:53.41]No.
[312:55.03]Sick of those stories.
[312:57.03]No.
[312:57.75]But about a year ago, I was hospitalized for depression and anxiety, and the somewhat routine of your streams has actually really helped me over the past year.
[313:03.73]Currently attending a therapeutic school now, but your streams help me forget I'm in a literal loony bin for my schooling.
[313:11.34]Don't think of it like that.
[313:14.86]No, don't look at it like that.
[313:19.04]I, uh... I wish you well.
[313:22.22]Hopefully that you can kind of power through it.
[313:26.52]Sounds like you're doing just that.
[313:30.10]But, you know, give yourself a little credit.
[313:32.42]You don't have to... I wouldn't classify that.
[313:36.15]Classify yourself like that.
[313:39.17]But...
[313:41.40]Anytime that you want to hang out here, and if this stream helps you, that's more than I could ever ask.
[313:49.33]I'm very, very happy that somebody, somewhere in the world, gets something out of these streams.
[313:59.99]Thank you.
[314:01.99]Take care of yourself, and I wish you the best.
[314:05.54]Good luck on getting through what you're going through.
[314:10.38]It's not a fucking easy fight.
[314:12.67]But fight it.
[314:15.11]Sir Enigma, thanks for the $5.
[314:18.94]Awesome stream, awesome streamer.
[314:20.14]Always watch your content on here on YouTube and I laugh my ass off.
[314:22.50]Thanks again.
[314:24.64]Thanks for $5, Sir Enigma.
[314:27.47]Thank you.
[314:33.19]Uh, let's talk about a $50 that I missed in the, in the, in the chaos of money.
[314:39.40]Uh, Toshi, Toshiro, Toshiro.TV gave 50 bucks not that long ago.
[314:46.94]They say, let's take a minute to talk about how well Jerma has aged as a comedian.
[314:50.92]Back in your TF2 days, you demonstrated that you had what it took to be an internet personality.
[314:55.39]And those who recognized it stuck with you.
[314:57.33]And now in a platform that has so many possibilities for an entertainer, you've delivered every single bit back to us tenfold in the form of the finest red blend comedy I've ever seen.
[315:07.27]You deserve every dollar coming your way.
[315:08.71]Here's to you, kid.
[315:21.45]I'm glad you think it's funny, because if you didn't... I don't know.
[315:27.45]I'm not sure I would be doing it for as long as I have.
[315:30.80]You know?
[315:34.50]I'm... I'm glad that people fucking think this is fun.
[315:41.71]I had this like certain idea when I was younger and you know years- a couple years ago- three years ago of like what I want to do.
[315:47.71]How do I want to make this happen? How do I want to continue to move-
[315:49.00]Because it wasn't kind of a different thing, right?
[315:53.00]Like I went from doing Team Fortress gameplay commentaries about like the spy knife to: I want to do other stuff like this.
[315:59.00]Is it worth doing? Will I alienate some people if I say something fucking like this?
[316:05.00]I don't know... but I'm uh I'm glad that people think it's fun.
[316:13.87]I think a lot of people go through that, though.
[316:15.37]If you do any type of... It doesn't matter what you do.
[316:18.88]If you're doing something that uses some type of mental energy and you start to change the way that you do things or pivot to something else, you almost kind of worry about if it was the right call.
[316:31.92]But... I'm glad that people think it's funny.
[316:38.50]Thank you for the $50, Toshiro.
[316:41.40]And the incredible amount of support.
[316:42.68]Thank you.
[316:44.51]Spicy Cues, thanks for the $1.00.
[316:47.76]Dubska Dude, thanks for the $1.00.
[316:49.08]I'm currently $1.00 in debt and may have to file for bankruptcy because of it.
[316:53.46]I'm giving you this dollar to you instead.
[316:55.48]Hope you feel awful because you did this.
[317:01.40]Hey, Novi333, thanks for the $3.33.
[317:03.38]Hey, Jerma, given how generous this community is, do you think we could have a charity night?
[317:08.48]I think we could raise some serious money to help people in need.
[317:13.10]Yeah, I've thought about charity nights before and how to run them and how to make them work.
[317:20.52]I think of years ago, the once a year, you know, the tip of the hats was always something that I wanted to be a part of.
[317:28.43]But probably... That is a nice idea, yeah.
[317:35.17]I would want to have that logistically make sense, right?
[317:38.85]Because pretty much, like I said, once a year or so I would be part of somebody else's stream or somebody else's event or charity event and I would kind of go or do or show up and promote and... But nothing just like personally for me in this stream in this community.
[317:58.36]It's always been something else or somebody else's event.
[318:03.65]But I'll do some research on that and figure out what I'd want to do.
[318:06.28]Yeah, I take a lot of time to research charities, though.
[318:13.18]A lot are actually kind of shady.
[318:15.00]Yeah, that's another thing, too, is it's hard.
[318:17.99]I'm not the greatest on trying to pick stuff out like that.
[318:20.59]That's why I've always felt more comfortable supporting ones that people have already done the research on.
[318:25.92]So...
[318:30.50]And maybe it would be another thing where I would just support another one and be on another event stream or do something like that rather than my own.
[318:37.62]But I do agree how... just how generous this community is.
[318:46.41]It's very, very, very generous.
[318:51.12]But something to think about for sure.
[318:54.64]Let's move on to Thin Rue for $1.
[318:56.34]Hey, Jeremiah, I used to think I was useless, but then I found out I can draw porn kind of well.
[319:05.05]You're going to find something you're good at.
[319:19.03]I don't know what you want me to tell you.
[319:20.39]You're good at something.
[319:25.61]And eerie, you know what I mean?
[319:32.36]But that's good that you found something that you think that you can do, you know?
[319:36.18]Thank you, Thin Rue, for the $1.
[319:37.06]And good luck.
[319:39.78]Thank you, Great Canadian Fuck Club, for the $5.
[319:41.54]If you wear the same pair of socks for long enough, do they become hard enough to be shoes?
[319:48.46]What is this Twitch thing?
[319:51.24]With, like, socks and... Thank you.
[319:58.17]Uh, moo-oo-oon.
[320:00.59]Thanks for the five dollars.
[320:01.51]Hey, Jerma, you know my biggest New Year's resolution was to catch more of your streams.
[320:05.73]And while I have failed mostly so far, I am thankful to catch whatever I can.
[320:09.71]You are great in every way that matters.
[320:12.80]Love you.
[320:13.26]Glad you can catch some streams.
[320:16.25]If you can't catch streams, there's a couple avenues to catch up with if you feel the need to.
[320:22.08]There is the second channel, which has obviously edited highlights.
[320:26.00]There's the archive channel that is independently run that I don't have really anything to do with, but is independently uploading archives.
[320:34.84]Nobody can make it to every stream.
[320:37.28]It's a lot of time.
[320:39.56]Even like a five, six hour stream like this one is gonna be.
[320:42.77]It's a very significant portion of somebody's day.
[320:45.65]so glad to have you while you're here thank you uh crazy dude josh thanks for the 15 just want to say thank you for helping me through hard times I recently started working in a sushi restaurant here in Vegas and just thank you for helping me with your comedy really might have to pay you a visit
[321:15.61]I fucking love sushi.
[321:21.90]Go to place.
[321:22.76]Go to place.
[321:23.98]No, that's awesome.
[321:27.84]That's awesome.
[321:28.66]That's fucking cool.
[321:29.70]I'll probably show up.
[321:31.91]You think I'm fucking around?
[321:34.72]And I'm gonna order a bunch of fucking weird shit.
[321:37.01]I'm gonna be like, I want you to take that.
[321:38.21]I want you to dip it in oil.
[321:40.05]I'm gonna be really, like, I'm gonna be like, you're gonna have one of those fucking Las Vegas McDonald's copypasta stories about me.
[321:54.35]He's testing you.
[321:56.41]But that's awesome.
[321:57.52]Crazy dude Josh, thanks for the 15 bucks.
[321:59.90]And...
[322:02.13]Eventually, maybe I'll take a trip down to that restaurant.
[322:05.87]Thank you so much.
[322:07.92]Keith!
[322:08.28]Thank you, Keith Ward, for the $1.
[322:09.96]Can I borrow $500?
[322:10.80]I... I don't... I... I don't... I... I don't do loans?
[322:23.53]And only a little bit more.
[322:24.79]We're almost at the end.
[322:27.68]$10 from Damon X. Thank you for everything, Jeremy.
[322:30.14]You're wonderful, funny, and inspiring.
[322:32.04]You've helped me laugh in the darkest moments of my life, and I can't thank you enough for that.
[322:35.44]You absolutely deserve the world.
[322:36.62]Sending you love now and always.
[322:42.41]A lot of fucking nice things.
[322:43.41]People say a lot of nice things to me.
[322:48.35]Almost to a point where I...
[322:55.46]I just don't want anyone to ever think that I'm just kind of trying to power through your messages talking about how fucking nice you're being to me.
[323:07.05]A ton of people give a lot of money and say a lot of fucking really nice things.
[323:12.55]I just hope collectively you understand that I'm forever grateful.
[323:22.20]Forever grateful.
[323:26.12]And there were some new ones that came in.
[323:28.15]We had Shimmy Sham for $5.
[323:29.27]While we're getting sentimental, you're one of the most positive influences in my life.
[323:34.61]I'd like to revisit old TF2 videos.
[323:37.81]Thank you for being such a good boy.
[323:40.22]Thank you, Shimmy Sham, for the $5.
[323:41.82]And that channel is never going away.
[323:45.46]I I love that channel I love every video I've made on that channel except for the bottom warfare 3 kill confirmed 17 and 4 gameplay commentary and some of the Minecraft videos and some of the uh grandpa videos that I didn't think were very funny and probably um at least four or five of the let's play videos that I made like one or two episodes of and I've deleted them uh all the auto videos um
[324:13.84]Maybe like 60 videos on that channel that I don't really think of, I don't like.
[324:18.56]Five Nights at Freddy's, uh, Demon Lord video, yeah, that's another one.
[324:24.06]But for real, thank you.
[324:25.94]Uh, for being around for that long and for enjoying the videos.
[324:29.10]Thank you, Following Snail, for the $20.
[324:30.86]Have missed so many of your streams, still try to catch the VODs.
[324:34.11]Here are some bits for support.
[324:37.01]It's been a lot of that recently.
[324:38.49]Thank you for the $20, and thank you for hanging out, and thank you for catching a stream when you can.
[324:45.39]Really appreciate it.
[324:47.65]That just kind of scared me.
[324:50.83]That like, you didn't even hear it, but I heard it.
[324:55.45]Thank you.
[324:57.21]Thank you, Hunter D for the 10 bucks.
[324:59.55]Hey, Jerma, you deserve every penny of what you've gotten tonight and have changed the lives of many.
[325:03.43]And I hope you keep this up for many more years.
[325:05.12]Thanks for all these memories.
[325:07.32]Moo means moo.
[325:08.27]Thanks for the $15.
[325:08.73]I haven't been able to catch much of the stream tonight, but I wanted to thank you for all you do and that you deserve every penny you're given.
[325:16.29]You're a hard worker and a great guy.
[325:18.35]I can't even imagine what my life would be like if I haven't found this community of great people to get me through tougher times and to habitually pop in and say hi to when things are good.
[325:28.28]Love you all, and all this wouldn't be possible without you.
[325:31.34]Jerma, take care.
[325:33.81]No, it wouldn't be.
[325:34.47]It wouldn't be possible.
[325:36.59]There's a ton of people here that... A community doesn't exist without the community.
[325:43.34]The stream doesn't exist without the community, without people here to watch.
[325:46.00]It's not going to happen.
[325:50.48]Thank you.
[325:52.67]Thank you so goddamn much for everything.
[325:58.13]Also, thank you to... Thank you to Dork Cube for the three bucks.
[326:03.75]Since we're getting sincere, I should mention that just two weeks ago this semester, I can already tell it's gonna be tough.
[326:10.11]I was late to my second class and my computer science professor spoke condescendingly to the whole class because none of us were taught a specific part of coding in the previous course.
[326:19.04]Then when I got home, I had to do 20 sketches for my art class.
[326:22.20]So when I saw you streaming, I literally jumped out of my chair and yelled, yes.
[326:28.88]I can't imagine I have that kind of effect on you.
[326:30.56]And I'm happy I do.
[326:38.14]Stick with it.
[326:39.06]It can be fucking tough.
[326:44.18]Thank you so much for being around.
[326:45.92]You've been around a long time.
[326:47.32]You've been around for 700,000 years.
[326:48.08]So, thank you, DoorCube.
[326:52.35]Uh, BECPNG, thanks for the one dollar.
[326:55.19]Hey Jerma, I know tonight's got a lot of feels, and it feels like the right time to say that even as a new viewer, I can see you've got something really special going on here.
[327:02.45]You're a real genuine clown.
[327:04.89]Uh, you also just gave that pep talk of the century.
[327:08.30]I really needed that.
[327:09.48]Much love to you.
[327:10.12]Also, I don't know if you like sloppy fan art, but I made some the other week.
[327:15.06]Sloppy fan art?
[327:15.90]This is fucking beautiful.
[327:16.84]What are you talking about?
[327:23.31]That's very, that's, look.
[327:24.45]That's pretty fucking good.
[327:31.64]That's not sloppy at all.
[327:32.74]That's like the reverse of sloppy.
[327:36.60]Good work.
[327:38.92]And new viewer, thank you.
[327:40.60]Thanks for somehow stumbling upon the channel.
[327:43.39]And I'm glad you stayed.
[327:45.87]Thank you, Beck.
[327:49.25]And great art.
[327:50.94]I'm a very old fan.
[327:51.90]So we got back to back here.
[327:52.60]New fan and old fan.
[327:53.74]Let us view the art.
[327:54.38]Wait, I didn't post it?
[327:55.06]I posted it.
[327:56.40]Did it not go through?
[327:57.06]It should have.
[328:21.21]Oh, one guy said that.
[328:22.53]Oh, okay.
[328:25.15]Thank you, K-Link, for the $15 to follow up my original bits.
[328:28.95]I'm moving to Atlanta to look for a new job in a few weeks and leaving behind all my stuff at my parents' house.
[328:35.02]I'm incredibly nervous and I'm not really looking forward to it.
[328:42.36]New chapters have a blank page.
[328:46.34]You already wrote the old one.
[328:48.68]Felt the same way when I moved to Vegas.
[328:50.04]I had my whole life back in Massachusetts.
[328:51.46]Everything.
[328:51.74]My entire life was Massachusetts.
[328:52.86]The whole thing.
[328:55.28]You got a new page.
[328:58.02]What's that, uh... When I see two people flowin' When I see two joints that knowin' This is when, where your bit begins.
[329:28.00]The fucking stream is dying.
[329:30.62]That was so awful that Cox just decided to close my internet off.
[329:49.87]They took emergency measures.
[329:51.23]They're like, turn that fucking stream off.
[329:52.93]That is so bad.
[329:53.77]He's embarrassing himself again.
[329:56.51]Turn it off.
[329:56.97]Turn his stream off.
[330:00.70]That was genuine shame.
[330:01.98]It was.
[330:03.78]Because I didn't know the lyrics and I just knew that one part.
[330:07.18]But you get the idea.
[330:13.98]Cox has got your back.
[330:16.12]But, uh, for real, when moving anywhere, you really just kind of start a new life for yourself.
[330:24.25]You leave everything behind, you start something new, you keep going.
[330:28.03]You gotta write the book.
[330:29.60]Like I didn't, but, you know, the life book.
[330:33.54]You gotta write the life book.
[330:36.45]Thank you, K-Link, for the $15.
[330:37.81]Thank you, Daffyrix, for the $2.63.
[330:40.85]Hey, Jerma, this is all the money I got while begging outside on the subway.
[330:44.83]Hope this helps, but for real, you're one of the only streamers that I've been able to make writhing, that I've been made to writhe in pain from laughter.
[330:52.52]Much love.
[330:52.90]Uh-oh.
[330:59.45]Are we gonna be good here?
[331:00.95]Are they turning me off?
[331:03.62]Hey, Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the dollar.
[331:05.14]Read your own eulogy.
[331:06.62]I'm not doing that, it's too scary.
[331:08.82]I can't do that.
[331:11.54]That's like, that's like, that's like something I'm not gonna do.
[331:13.92]I don't like that.
[331:16.49]Uh, Dark... Thank you, Dark Angel Aven, thanks for the one dollar.
[331:20.55]Jerm, a very old subscriber of yours from YouTube.
[331:23.03]I used to watch your countless videos of TF2 spy tutorials.
[331:26.79]I'm heartwarming to see you're still surviving off of using... Why is this...
[331:33.36]This popped up like twice with a different name?
[331:35.84]No, it's the same name.
[331:41.70]Yeah, what the fuck, Cox?
[331:42.62]Come on.
[331:47.70]Are we good?
[331:48.26]Are we good here?
[331:49.60]Uh-oh.
[331:56.55]Uh-oh.
[331:59.78]But thank you, Dark Angel, for the $1 there.
[332:10.12]Thank you, Vance, for the $1.
[332:11.66]Jerma, please play the song Fig Leaf by Carbonite from MF DOOM.
[332:17.79]The guy in the beginning sounds exactly like you.
[332:19.79]Well, I might not be able to.
[332:32.86]MF DOOM's a great rapper.
[332:34.99]Thank you, Vance.
[332:54.19]Thank you, Mr. Shadow Man, for the one doll.
[332:57.11]Not sure if my earlier bits went through, but there's possibly a large backlog.
[333:01.82]Anyways, I don't... And I don't remember if you said 62,000 or 6,200 subs.
[333:04.02]It's not 62,000.
[333:04.36]That's not... I don't have 62,000 subs.
[333:05.26]I would be... I would be literal, like, billionaire.
[333:07.68]That's like 100 millionaire.
[333:09.34]62,000 subs is not that high.
[333:28.07]Uh, come on, Cox, what the fuck is this?
[333:32.86]Uh, if not, forget I said anything.
[333:35.62]Well, uh, thank you, Mr. Shadow Man, for the one dollar, and that would be crazy if there were that many people.
[333:41.68]It already is crazy now, but that would be beyond ludicrous.
[333:51.33]Uh, good luck.
[333:52.71]I found out of you because of Star.
[333:55.23]She's a good buddy of mine.
[333:57.97]Uh, good luck.
[333:58.51]And Taylor from Lifeline better be in the next Jerma Rumble with the lowest stats.
[334:02.23]Accurate representation of her character.
[334:07.12]End of the stream for two hours.
[334:10.88]IvyCastTV, thanks for the three bucks.
[334:13.80]Doing my job, saving lives, giving the chance.
[334:16.48]Thanks for being you and calling me out.
[334:18.36]Ha ha ha.
[334:19.16]They said ha ha.
[334:22.22]Calling you out.
[334:22.86]No, what?
[334:24.28]I'm just kidding with you.
[334:25.76]Just messing around.
[334:26.82]Thank you, Ivy Kaz.
[334:34.71]Let's see.
[334:36.95]Thank you to GigaMemeSupreme.
[334:40.76]For the $10.
[334:40.96]Hey Germany, no, it's not Broluck money.
[334:43.87]Don't worry.
[334:44.73]You can't compare yourself.
[334:46.21]That's a huge amount of money to be comparing yourself to.
[334:49.99]But I'm watching your stuff for a long time and I want to say thank you for all the happiness you brought us over the years.
[334:53.27]We love you, you fucking dunce.
[334:56.80]Thank you, GigaMemeSupreme.
[334:59.68]For $10.
[334:59.84]Broluck money.
[335:05.55]TV Table, thanks for the dollar.
[335:07.71]Watching your streams for a long time, you never fail to make me laugh.
[335:10.93]Thank you, TV Table.
[335:12.35]Hope to be as entertaining as you one day.
[335:16.77]That's a fucking really nice thing to say.
[335:18.71]Thank you so much.
[335:20.67]Vance, thank you again for the one dollar.
[335:22.25]This is hilarious.
[335:23.05]It's literally you in the song.
[335:25.39]Well, anyway... Oh, we just heard it.
[335:29.41]Thank you, Vance.
[335:32.05]Thank you also to...
[335:35.19]We had Fly4Shy had the $50.
[335:38.13]Unfortunately going through a rough breakup.
[335:40.93]Really sorry.
[335:41.51]Really terrible to fucking hear that, Fly4Shy.
[335:43.21]But thank you again for the $50.
[335:46.83]What else we have?
[335:48.75]We're at the end.
[335:50.05]We have made it to the end of the hyper money stream.
[335:55.41]So, well, not quite.
[335:58.06]Uh, thank you to Chi Hue for the $3.50.
[336:03.62]Uh, love ya.
[336:06.14]How much care you put into your work?
[336:07.90]Pursue those crazy stream ideas and get creative.
[336:10.66]Oh, yeah.
[336:11.72]I also remember that you being you and having fun is all we could ask for.
[336:15.71]If you're still reading these, I hope your eyes are alright.
[336:17.63]Man Geezer.
[336:23.67]Oh, I think he said Man Geeze.
[336:27.68]Yeah, and we're still going through the little rough internet patch here for some reason.
[336:32.14]Somehow.
[336:34.86]Street Fighter 6 Hyper Money Stream.
[336:39.54]Thank you, Chi.
[336:41.22]Thank you also to Jess Homeboy for the $1.
[336:43.66]Just came in here and you say you need to put up the bit limit, but really don't want to.
[336:47.71]Shows how much you care about interacting with your fans.
[336:50.11]And it's so touching to hear.
[336:51.89]Also, the painting's coming along nicely.
[336:53.79]I'll buy as many bits as I need so that I can show you when it's done.
[336:58.96]It's always a tough decision to make because I don't want to alienate people from thinking, oh, well, no, I'm not going to give any money.
[337:08.05]I can't give any money.
[337:09.09]I want to, but he's not going to read the thing that I want to tell him.
[337:12.25]You know what I mean?
[337:13.67]It's a rough place, like rock and a hard place, because at one point, I don't want to alienate people from...
[337:21.80]Well, I can't tell him anything now because now he's he like sold out and he's like a three or four dollar minimum to say anything now.
[337:29.12]And it's like, I hate that fucking feeling.
[337:31.11]I don't like that feeling.
[337:34.21]And but on the other hand, you know, sometimes the ends of the stream with this many people can can go on for hours and hours.
[337:42.70]I want everyone to feel like that a dollar to a thousand dollars, that I think that you all fucking matter here, you know what I mean?
[337:52.64]It's not just like, well, those of you that don't have five dollars tonight, I'm sorry, but you can't say shit.
[337:59.53]I've never liked that.
[338:03.55]But you gotta do what you gotta do.
[338:10.62]Still struggling with the internet here.
[338:13.82]For some strange reason.
[338:15.36]It doesn't want to work right now.
[338:18.18]But, thank you.
[338:19.58]We will do what I think needs to be done.
[338:23.04]iKaneKLing, thanks for the $1.
[338:26.28]Congrats on surviving your genital warts.
[338:32.45]Oh, that... Oh, okay.
[338:33.67]From the... That's how... That was from the year ago stream?
[338:42.16]That was the thing from Bio Inc, whatever it was.
[338:47.70]But thank you for the 10 bucks.
[338:49.78]Brolock, thanks for the $1.
[338:50.90]Hey mate, check the top 10 cheers on the Bits of Leaderboard.
[338:53.88]Yep.
[338:55.24]Can you believe that's what people are willing to give you?
[338:57.32]I bet never thought clicking that upload button and start stream button would mean so much to people.
[339:09.89]No, never.
[339:12.97]But I'm happy it does.
[339:14.73]Thank you.
[339:19.31]EvoipTV, thanks for the five bucks.
[339:20.95]Been watching you for a long time.
[339:21.91]You're one of the people who inspired me to start becoming a content creator.
[339:25.15]And seeing you be so humble like this is exactly the type of person I want to be if I ever blew up.
[339:29.20]So keep making the great content.
[339:33.30]Good luck to you, Evoip.
[339:37.50]It's a tough world in the content creation landscape.
[339:42.75]I wish you the best.
[339:43.37]Stream, do what you want, have fun.
[339:46.81]And we're still dropping frames.
[339:53.25]This just kind of came on like that, huh?
[339:55.93]We've been pretty solid for like a couple months.
[339:58.05]I don't know.
[340:02.06]Uh, Superman, thanks for the $1 since you've already seen Celeryman.
[340:04.80]Here's another Tim and Eric.
[340:05.56]I've seen pretty much all of them.
[340:07.68]Oh, I've seen them all.
[340:08.32]Yeah, this is the internet.
[340:09.12]Yeah, I've watched almost every Tim and Eric skit that's ever been done.
[340:13.19]They're very, very good.
[340:14.43]They're very funny and they're very... If you've never seen it before... Definitely, you definitely need to watch this.
[340:22.02]The internet caught up with the YouTube channel.
[340:23.78]Here it comes.
[340:27.90]Uh, thank you, though, Superman.
[340:31.67]Thank you, Grapplemace.
[340:45.55]I'm currently reading the current bits.
[340:47.27]We did the old ones.
[340:48.17]Another reason why this end of the stream has been more than two, three hours is because I pushed the bits from this morning to now.
[340:55.26]So, that's another reason why it's been a little longer than usual.
[341:02.00]But thank you, Grapple Mace.
[341:05.34]Sick Vic, thanks for the two bucks.
[341:08.02]Hope this worked.
[341:08.82]My boyfriend introduced me to your streams and your YouTube a while back, and I've loved your stuff ever since.
[341:13.13]Keep on trucking.
[341:16.21]Thank you.
[341:17.13]I'm going to keep going.
[341:17.73]I'm going to keep trying.
[341:21.12]Only a few more left.
[341:22.34]Thank you, Christ Vilgen for the $10.
[341:25.05]Love you, man.
[341:26.15]Now that you have millions of dollars, I want to see Jerma RoboLife 2 on Dafoe's IMDB page.
[341:37.05]I don't know if I'm gonna have that much money.
[341:39.79]But I really appreciate the $10, and it's a good idea.
[341:46.43]Thank you, Dark Angel Aven.
[341:48.72]For a dollar?
[341:49.18]I'm an old subscriber who used to die laughing watching Chiefs of Spy tutorials.
[341:53.02]I'm... Am I... Was this what this is hap- This was earlier?
[342:00.95]Or... I have no- I have no idea what's going on.
[342:05.33]My brain is like... This is- There was two other ones.
[342:12.78]Those four bits are the same.
[342:14.14]I was confused.
[342:15.08]I'm sorry.
[342:15.58]Skip.
[342:16.02]Oh, okay.
[342:16.84]I thought I was like, am I like, did I read these?
[342:21.70]But thank you for the $4, Dark Angel.
[342:25.34]And then you also see people that say YouTube and Twitch and video games and comedy isn't worth people's money.
[342:33.27]But it's more for a personality and attitude like yours.
[342:35.43]I aspire to be you and look up to you as a role model.
[342:39.31]You've been a huge influence on my life.
[342:42.24]That's... I can't believe people see me as a role model.
[342:47.40]I don't know, I mean, I... Thank you for looking up to me.
[342:54.12]I don't know... I'm not sure what pedestal I would put myself on.
[342:58.69]I wouldn't... But, thank you nonetheless.
[343:06.53]Happy to be there.
[343:08.63]And then a couple more, just a couple more.
[343:11.91]Just a few more.
[343:12.97]Here we are, we got, we got Palasonic, $1.
[343:16.37]Missed the stream today, looking forward to watching this one on YouTube.
[343:19.16]I just jumped in and a lot of people are saying how much you've helped them mentally.
[343:21.62]It's a great, it's great man, really warms my heart.
[343:24.34]You're doing a great fucking thing.
[343:25.36]A lot of entertainers don't do that.
[343:29.12]I can just, I just, I just try.
[343:30.94]I can just try.
[343:33.08]I'm glad that you fucking like being here.
[343:34.92]I'm happy that you think it's a lot of fun.
[343:38.43]all that matters thank you Dr. steen one dollar are you still interested in voice acting not so much anymore I think like stuff like Twitch has just taken up all of my time so focusing on it completely is I think more important to me at this point but I still think it's a great craft I still love it but not anymore I don't think not currently not now
[344:05.24]Hey, Mostly Lost, thanks for the $1 for real, though.
[344:07.18]I harass you all the time through bits, but you're really such a huge inspiration for everything I do.
[344:12.56]You're an incredible model of positivity in a world that desperately needs more of it.
[344:16.69]Thanks for everything you do for us.
[344:17.69]You really do deserve every bit and sub you've ever gotten.
[344:20.15]Tonight and forever.
[344:24.05]Thank you, Mostly Lost.
[344:26.40]Thank you, Leroy, for the $5.
[344:28.00]Thank you for being such a positive influence in my life through a crappy high school, an abusive relationship, and trying and failing out of college three times over in the last seven to eight years.
[344:38.52]You inspire me to never give up, and this community is just a wonderful wellspring of creative joy.
[344:42.72]Much love.
[344:47.55]I mean, the one thing... Here's one thing, though, right?
[344:51.41]Tried and failed college three times.
[344:54.07]Three times...
[344:55.41]You're still trying.
[344:56.75]You know?
[345:00.69]Keep trying.
[345:01.19]Keep going.
[345:04.22]Don't... Don't give up.
[345:09.30]Thank you so much for the $5.
[345:11.14]And thank you for being part of this community.
[345:14.48]Good luck.
[345:20.43]50 more dollars from the McRib is back!
[345:23.46]Yo, Jerma man, keep up the hustle.
[345:25.18]Peace.
[345:27.68]$50 at the end here.
[345:30.88]Thank you, McRib is back for the 50 fucking bucks.
[345:36.76]McRib is not even back.
[345:40.54]The McRib is not even back.
[345:42.10]You're not going to be able to get your, like, piece of mystery meat that got ran over by a car.
[345:46.36]It's not there.
[345:48.18]But boy, is it fucking, is it delicious.
[345:50.49]It's not.
[345:59.25]But for real.
[346:01.49]The McRib is not back?
[346:02.77]Oh, what the hell?
[346:03.71]I wanted the McRib.
[346:05.03]It's my favorite sandwich.
[346:07.34]It's not there.
[346:11.12]Thank you for the $50, though, for real.
[346:12.96]Discord B, thanks for the $1.
[346:15.59]Jerma, I missed you reading my other bit donation, and I felt awful about it, so I will spend more money.
[346:19.81]But...
[346:21.07]I'm an old TF2 fan and was a fan ever since.
[346:24.05]Is there a way to private message you?
[346:26.33]If not, I understand.
[346:27.26]I just really wanted to know how much you really helped me through the years.
[346:29.96]I just don't have any money for bit donations.
[346:32.00]I'm sorry about that.
[346:32.76]Don't apologize for giving me money.
[346:35.89]But I don't do private message.
[346:38.61]I don't have DMs open or anything like that.
[346:40.47]I don't.
[346:41.57]Because it can get overwhelming.
[346:44.19]It can get very overwhelming.
[346:45.33]And instead of focusing on this stream and this collective gathering of stuff to do, I don't read.
[346:56.40]I can't.
[346:57.06]It's too much.
[347:01.06]And then if, you know, let's say a bunch of people want to talk to me or ask me things and then I give them a response and then I, you know, a couple days go by, maybe I don't respond and I'm doing something else.
[347:10.94]It's just, it's too much.
[347:13.06]I can't spread myself that thin.
[347:20.13]So, because I know the kind of person that I am.
[347:24.39]And that Bilbo Baggins quote spreading yourself too thin Like butter on toast Toast ends up being fucking disgusting and you don't want to eat it anymore Gandalf But thank you, I really appreciate the fact that you didn't want to talk to me in the first place Demonic cucumber $1.
[347:43.66]It's a meme read the comments Yeah, but here okay here's thing about
[347:50.74]I don't want to like brigade a post that just maybe doesn't belong.
[347:54.28]You know what I mean?
[347:55.06]I can't like officially condone something that maybe somebody's doing on like a website.
[348:02.65]You know what I mean?
[348:04.53]That's... Maybe doesn't necessarily...
[348:17.54]It's just the JermaCraft.
[348:19.87]It's just the JermaCraft intro.
[348:30.80]These comments.
[348:34.44]Yeah, I don't... Because here's the thing.
[348:36.50]I don't want... That's funny.
[348:39.50]It is.
[348:40.60]But I also don't want to...
[348:43.88]I'm not sure if that website is a, um... I'm not sure what that website is.
[348:48.99]I've never really gone to it, but... I don't want to make, like, a funny joke about... You know, a place where people maybe put stuff where they lose loved ones.
[348:57.49]And, you know, that's... That doesn't really sit... You know what I mean?
[349:02.64]So, I don't want that to necessarily be something that I say, Oh, yeah!
[349:06.80]Look it out!
[349:07.30]You know what I'm saying?
[349:14.45]It's funny in our... It's funny in our context here.
[349:18.80]Because we know... We have the joke here.
[349:23.28]But... I don't want to cause a problem for somebody else.
[349:26.50]I don't want to cause an issue or... I like to stay away from that kind of stuff.
[349:31.99]So... It's funny.
[349:35.69]It is funny.
[349:36.27]Because, like I said, we know what it is.
[349:41.17]But... You understand.
[349:41.88]You understand.
[349:43.84]Interesting stuff.
[349:45.98]And then finally, at the end here, we've got... Here we go.
[349:49.86]Ready?
[349:50.96]Last few.
[349:53.74]Uh... We've got... Dark Angel for $1.
[349:57.17]Getting late.
[349:58.11]P.S.
[349:58.41]I would love to become an active streamer like you.
[350:00.35]Starting out reading every donation since I won't have many.
[350:04.33]Uh... Fans to begin with as you did transferring from YouTube.
[350:07.09]Do you think being a Twitch streamer is a stable job with enough... Stop you right there.
[350:11.84]I'm gonna stop you right there.
[350:15.25]Very important.
[350:18.25]You cannot go into a new venture like this with the idea of money being there.
[350:26.23]I think that is the absolute wrong way to do this.
[350:30.51]It's not a stable job.
[350:33.89]It's not something to go into.
[350:36.99]Hey, that's what I'm going to do for work and that's what I'm going to do for money.
[350:39.86]That's not the best attitude to have here.
[350:43.85]You have to do it.
[350:46.24]And do it because you want to do it, because you want to, not because you want something from it.
[350:51.30]You know what I mean?
[350:51.78]You don't... Money, I'm talking, monetarily.
[350:54.42]You can't go into it thinking it's a job.
[350:57.31]Because it requires other people to watch.
[350:59.85]For it to become a job.
[351:02.27]So, as long as you have an attitude that's not... There is money, but just Jerma took it all.
[351:12.57]But if you said I was good at something, never do it for free.
[351:14.55]Yeah, but you can't have that mentality when you start out.
[351:21.80]If you have a goal, a monetary goal, that is, let's say, a stable income from Twitch, you are setting yourself up for disappointment.
[351:36.71]Because if you don't get to that point that you want to get to,
[351:40.61]That's a problem because I wanted to do this for work.
[351:44.39]But that's not how it works.
[351:45.53]You can't go into it like that.
[351:52.20]Whoever wants to stream, if you want to be a streamer and you want to be a YouTuber, good fucking luck to you.
[351:57.60]I hope you make great content.
[351:58.94]I hope you put out stuff that you're proud of, that you think is interesting.
[352:02.30]But you can't go into it with the mindset of this is my job and I'm going to do this for money.
[352:09.41]It's... I think it's an attitude you have to leave at the door.
[352:18.66]Broluck money.
[352:21.58]But good luck.
[352:24.13]Uh... Ooglagoob, thanks for the three bucks.
[352:25.99]Not so fast, Jeremy.
[352:26.83]One more.
[352:27.13]You deserve all the love.

[352:56.08]I think it's a great shirt.
[352:57.10]It's one of my favorite shirts.

[357:25.42]Very end.
[357:26.62]Fatfinger, the last one.
[357:28.10]Watched your videos for years and years.
[357:29.46]It's brought me and my brother closer together.
[357:34.00]And eventually my wife came around as a big fan.
[357:36.36]You're awesome.
[357:37.10]Rats, rats, motherfucker.
[357:41.32]Bringing family together.
[357:42.38]That's fucking amazing.
[357:48.25]Thank you.

[358:02.27]Thank you so much.
[358:03.47]Bingo, Sunshine.
[358:06.69]And then finally here, let's... What?
[358:09.44]No, that's old, right?
[358:10.64]It's almost been three and a half hours of fucking, like, ridiculous hyper money support, like... Do you understand?
[358:30.05]Let me put the credits on because there's a baton of subscribers.
[358:33.65]Too many to count.
[358:36.66]More than I will ever be able to count.
[358:42.20]Take a look at this.
[358:52.61]Do it again.
[358:57.73]The software counts for you, but that's what I'm saying.
[359:00.15]I would never be able to count.
[359:02.29]I wouldn't be able to.
[359:11.75]Jesus.
[359:15.73]Thank you, uh... G-Y-H-D Gid.
[359:20.78]Hefei.
[359:21.14]That's what I'm gonna call you. $50.
[359:26.40]Hey Jerem, I think you missed my $100 of bits during those Brolek 100,000 donations.
[359:31.10]But don't worry, I'll repeat the question.
[359:32.88]What's your fetishes?
[359:42.51]Is this a... I'm not sure this is the place to discuss that.
[359:54.49]Hey, twitch.tv, Jerma985, let's talk about sex.
[359:57.93]No, that's, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[360:08.90]Thank you for the fucking huge amount of money.
[360:11.44]And BroLuck, thanks for the dollar.
[360:12.54]How does it feel that your most profitable stream was a fucking talking game?
[360:17.06]It could be any stream, and it would be like, I can't fucking believe it.
[360:22.47]Huge man thanks for the one dollar.
[360:24.47]Jerma, just donated before.
[360:26.59]Don't know if you missed out or not, but thanks for the laughs over the years.
[360:29.29]You better keep the hustle up.
[360:31.81]I'm gonna.
[360:37.54]Thank you all so much.
[360:40.12]That's the end of the stream.
[360:41.30]That's the end of the long, long list of money and subs.
[360:47.12]It's been the...
[360:55.46]I know some people may have trickled in here and just probably had no idea what was going on, and they were like, what the fuck is going on here?
[360:59.88]What is this guy doing?
[361:03.46]Long story short, I mean, it's just an insanely supportive community of tons of generous fucking people that all collectively build up the tower, like somebody said.
[361:22.73]I wish you all the best.
[361:25.07]Thank you for continuing to put support beams down for this channel.
[361:30.11]Couldn't do it without you.
[361:30.99]I could not do this without everybody fucking here.
[361:41.63]Thanks for watching the end of Lifeline a little while ago.
[361:47.40]We had more community subs come in.
[361:48.98]Five from Mrs. Space.
[361:51.62]I think we had others too.
[361:54.16]Yeah, Mr. Space gave... Mr. Space gave 10 humanity subs.
[362:01.47]Holy shit.
[362:05.49]I'll see you guys on Friday.
[362:13.32]Take care of yourselves.
[362:16.26]And thanks for continuing to be a part of this fucking stream.
[362:21.76]Have a great night.
[362:24.16]I'm gonna get Friday prepared and we'll have fun on Friday too, don't worry.
[362:29.60]Until then!
[362:32.62]Good night.
[362:36.54]That was the wrong button.
[362:39.30]That's the right button.
[362:44.29]See you all very soon.
