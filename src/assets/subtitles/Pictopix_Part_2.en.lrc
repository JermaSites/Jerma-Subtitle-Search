[00:01.76]Okay.
[00:03.62]Let's open up... I'm going to change my tweet as well.
[00:10.20]Because it is not correct.
[00:21.35]Let's get rid of that.
[00:24.78]Let's put a new one up that just says, pick Ross...
[00:34.93]Picross.
[00:37.47]Alright.
[00:38.27]No.
[00:44.51]Picross.
[00:45.81]Picross.
[00:47.14]I don't know what's right.
[00:47.86]How about just Picross now?
[00:54.76]That's fine.
[00:56.56]I'm okay with that.
[01:03.15]Hey, look at that.
[01:09.55]Alright, so those of you that are going to stick around, we're just going to play Picross.
[01:14.36]Picross, ask me anything.
[01:15.60]How does that sound?
[01:16.68]Ask me anything Picross stream.
[01:26.02]Ask me almost anything.
[01:33.80]Oh god, that was a... Kind of just opened that one up.
[01:39.16]PictoPix, there it is.
[01:40.46]My favorite little thing to play.
[01:42.24]Let's get it on screen.
[01:49.95]Have you ever played 3D Picross?
[01:51.29]I have.
[01:53.21]Ever gonna play Bayonetta 2?
[01:55.33]Uh, probably not.
[01:57.18]I'm gonna... Am I gonna do Scrabble?
[02:01.28]I'm probably not gonna play Scrabble.
[02:05.30]What are all of your political opinions?
[02:12.54]Alright.
[02:13.26]Uh, hold on.
[02:16.28]Do I still have the Twitch integration?
[02:19.08]I think so.
[02:22.18]I think it worked.
[02:26.27]Another $50 from... Not Ekins.
[02:30.55]I said it wrong.
[02:34.09]Thank you for the $50.
[02:36.09]Correcting my mispronunciation.
[02:39.30]My goodness.
[02:45.06]This is like $400.
[02:47.12]I made like four or five hundred fucking dollars.
[02:56.36]By having a bootleg Dreamcast broken disc and a top-down hard game that I gave up after like 45 minutes.
[03:14.14]Thank you guys.
[03:14.88]That's fucking insane.
[03:18.33]I think the Twitch integration still works.
[03:23.43]Let's find out if it does.
[03:28.79]PictoPix.
[03:29.63]There it is.
[03:33.23]So where did we leave off last time?
[03:36.27]So we made the mushroom, the boots.
[03:40.09]And...
[03:42.96]I'm bragging?
[03:44.12]No, no.
[03:44.74]I'm fucking surprised is what I'm saying.
[03:47.16]Alright, is Twitch integration working?
[03:54.98]It is, alright.
[03:56.10]So, there is Twitch integration in this game.
[03:57.92]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:58.68]I don't want you to play.
[03:59.65]I don't want you to play.
[04:02.39]I need to relax.
[04:07.73]Wait, why is...
[04:14.38]Oh.
[04:15.74]Alright, so, okay, let's fucking reboot the stream and play this chill puzzle game.
[04:21.06]Everybody, here's how you play.
[04:23.11]So as you can see, 10 by 10.
[04:29.79]It's a baby mode 10.
[04:30.75]We're just doing this to get everybody prepared.
[04:38.47]But no, let me be fair here, though.
[04:41.04]that there are probably a lot of people that are here that were not here last time a week ago so I how do you this this is how you play I'm gonna do it time me I'll put a 30 second timer on the screen no 10 second timer on the screen ready
[05:03.82]10.
[05:04.26]So every one of these numbers is a corresponding square.
[05:08.80]So for three, for instance, there's three squares in a row down this column here, right?
[05:15.21]So I don't know where it is.
[05:16.19]I have to use deduction.
[05:17.43]See, nine.
[05:18.39]That means there are nine here.
[05:20.73]Every time there's a space, there has to be at least one cube in between this number.
[05:26.55]Got it.
[05:26.93]Time's up.
[05:27.45]That's how you play.
[05:33.17]So we got, that's it right there.
[05:37.68]Actually, no, that can't be certain.
[05:39.08]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[05:41.28]Yeah, that can't be certain.
[05:42.94]You weren't listening?
[05:43.94]Just enjoy the pictures and enjoy the hangout session.
[05:49.42]See, I know this is two here.
[05:50.56]Where's my X?
[05:53.00]There it is.
[05:54.78]So remember, I know for a fact there's no way, because this one has to be space.
[05:59.80]I'm gonna- we're just gonna relax.
[06:01.46]Are you gonna shit-talk Joel again?
[06:04.96]No, this is my relax session.
[06:09.10]I'm not shit-talking anybody right now.
[06:11.14]So for instance, we've got three, six, seven, eight, nine.
[06:15.87]Not enough.
[06:19.65]And you can... I'm not using it right now, but there is Twitch integration.
[06:27.94]See, you're probably going, how did you?
[06:29.34]Because this is 9 out of 10.
[06:33.04]These have to be filled in for this to make any sense.
[06:35.94]Same thing with 7, right?
[06:37.34]7, as you see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 has to be there.
[06:39.94]Which, hey, look at that.
[06:41.10]We now know that the 3 is either here or here.
[06:42.70]Right?
[06:43.00]You understand?
[06:56.77]Oh, right, the spam.
[07:00.25]I probably should just turn it off.
[07:03.45]Should I just turn off the integration until I let you guys play around?
[07:09.94]I don't mean to spam.
[07:10.88]It's not me spamming.
[07:12.52]Alright, so we got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[07:16.08]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[07:16.20]Can't do that.
[07:17.28]Let's see.
[07:17.72]5, 2.
[07:17.78]This is 1.
[07:18.06]There's a 1 here.
[07:18.58]8.
[07:18.60]So, yeah, I told you like I told you before.
[07:28.42]I know that it has to be there.
[07:35.60]Okay, then we got two.
[07:37.60]There's only one more here.
[07:38.94]Am I going to play Stuntman?
[07:41.92]Yeah, I will.
[07:45.42]You can complete it.
[07:46.06]Yeah, you guys, every like two or three, I usually let chat do one.
[07:51.01]So interestingly enough, see how we have this block here.
[07:53.23]This has to be seven in a row.
[07:54.37]Therefore, see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[07:57.97]These have to be filled in.
[07:59.05]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[08:00.93]Paying attention.
[08:01.55]I'm happy that you are.
[08:02.91]Take a look at what happened here.
[08:04.95]This is five.
[08:05.77]So one, two, three, four, five.
[08:07.35]Already done.
[08:09.89]This is also already done.
[08:11.06]So we can fill the hole rolling.
[08:12.62]This is also now done completely.
[08:14.04]See how there's nothing else here.
[08:15.20]It's grayed out, which leaves.
[08:18.08]Hey, look at that.
[08:19.02]Two.
[08:20.60]And what happened here?
[08:21.38]Three, space, two.
[08:25.09]It's that simple.
[08:31.43]Whenever we do it together, we just try to screw you.
[08:33.72]Where's space Michael?
[08:37.04]Wait, there actually is music.
[08:39.36]It was turned off because it just, it's the same song.
[08:43.21]It's the same like jazz piano.
[08:52.81]Boring.
[08:56.93]Whatever.
[08:57.33]Alright, so let's see.
[08:59.51]What do we get to work with here?
[09:01.27]This is done completely.
[09:02.59]There's still a couple here.
[09:06.29]Seven.
[09:06.91]This is five.
[09:07.81]So one, two, three, four, five.
[09:10.52]One, two, three, four, five.
[09:11.84]I think we can do more than a few of these.
[09:14.58]Two, three, four, five.
[09:15.74]One, two, three, four, five.
[09:17.02]Yep.
[09:17.22]Alright, so three, three.
[09:19.02]Mark them.
[09:21.29]So there's a one here somewhere.
[09:25.37]This song makes me wanna shit.
[09:26.71]No, we're not doing the brown nose joke again.
[09:28.53]Where's the one here though?
[09:36.08]Play Chowder Man instead.
[09:39.04]No Chowder Man.
[09:41.88]It probably is just 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[09:43.62]No, it's definitely not here.
[09:47.46]Because if this is the 2, right, then there's nothing there.
[09:51.97]So you have to assume 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[09:54.65]And there's 3.
[09:58.35]Which leaves that.
[09:59.33]That's done.
[10:03.16]Put on Chowder Man.
[10:04.40]Do you guys really want me to put on Chowder Man?
[10:05.96]Do you really want that?
[10:14.80]Why is there a command that says I have a YouTube channel where I upload my videos in 4K?
[10:19.08]That's a lie.
[10:19.50]That's not real.
[10:19.92]Alright, I'll play Chowder Man for like 30 seconds.
[10:38.21]Okay.
[10:40.79]So take a look here.
[10:41.55]Three.
[10:41.97]One, two, there's a block.
[10:43.23]One, no, it has to be somewhere in here.
[10:44.83]Therefore, one, two, three.
[10:45.87]One, two, three.
[10:46.77]One, two, three.
[10:47.67]That has to be it.
[10:49.01]This row is done.
[10:49.63]This row is done.
[11:11.96]This song is killing me.
[11:16.00]Make it louder.
[11:20.49]You don't actually want this to be louder.
[11:23.57]Hey look, it has to be there.
[11:27.07]It has to be here.
[11:31.75]And then you got two, let's see, we cleared out this, this.
[11:35.13]Alright, you want me to stop talking?
[11:38.51]Fine.
[11:47.32]It's probably here.
[11:49.06]Is this Dig Dug?
[11:49.98]No, it's not Dig Dug.
[12:12.88]so oh you can by the way if you hashtag guess you can guess what it is I wonder if it's down here it might be like here uh what the hell am I doing chowder man sir I I I don't know what the I just did that for I just the whole thing up
[12:42.94]I just tried to complete it by guessing.
[12:44.24]I don't even remember which way it was.
[12:46.92]Uh, this is not real either.
[12:56.54]There's definitely some type of C person.
[13:05.49]Fixed A7.
[13:06.25]No, that's not right though.
[13:13.21]Alright, this is literally causing my brain to cease functioning.
[13:18.17]It's actually making my brain cease to function, playing that song.
[13:26.79]Is it Garfield?
[13:27.61]It's not Garfield.
[13:35.15]Then that is here.
[13:36.77]It's probably here.
[13:37.69]Let me just fill that in.
[13:41.45]Uh-huh.
[13:44.40]Yep.
[13:46.66]The question is... Yeah.
[13:49.38]Yeah, it really, it just beef brained me.
[13:54.11]What is it?
[13:54.47]Is it... Sonic?
[13:57.39]Sonic the Diver?
[14:05.34]Alright, what's next?
[14:09.04]This is called... This is called Hot Dad?
[14:19.42]Oh, that's the artist.
[14:24.90]Oh, okay.
[14:31.19]We'll just keep it on.
[14:32.15]Alright, here we go.
[14:33.61]See how it works, good.
[14:34.53]Let's see, yeah, that one's gonna be...
[14:50.99]1, 1, 1.
[14:52.67]Done.
[14:56.01]5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[14:56.95]Bingo.
[15:00.09]These I can't tell.
[15:01.13]That's all the ones there.
[15:02.01]Hey, look at that.
[15:03.45]You gotta be here, you gotta be here, you gotta be here.
[15:05.51]No, you don't.
[15:06.01]That's not even true.
[15:06.84]Why am I even pretending that that's the real answer?
[15:09.96]Could be either side.
[15:10.62]1, 1.
[15:11.98]1, 1.
[15:13.42]Somewhere in here.
[15:23.52]That works.
[15:26.64]And then, let's see.
[15:27.88]Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.
[15:29.22]This is four.
[15:31.30]One, two, three, four.
[15:34.58]One, two, three, four.
[15:35.56]One, two, three, four.
[15:37.02]Yep.
[15:37.81]There's your two.
[15:38.41]It was there, actually.
[15:39.55]It's definitely here, too.
[15:45.15]It kind of has to be.
[15:48.77]But I don't know that yet.
[15:50.33]Yes, I do.
[15:54.20]leading to four so we got one two three four one two three four look at that three one two where's the one here let's see so that's four down here this is done so that's here okay here's your four
[16:23.73]It looks like a question mark so far.
[16:27.83]I have to have my tools.
[16:48.50]One.
[16:48.76]It has to be here.
[16:50.02]There's two.
[16:52.44]Two.
[16:52.56]There it is.
[16:53.26]What is it?
[16:59.58]Hey, it's a paint roller.
[17:00.38]Who got it?
[17:02.70]Nice work, guys.
[17:03.52]You want to play Splatoon music?
[17:09.07]Oh, no.
[17:09.33]Splatoon as in that's what that looks like.
[17:10.77]Yeah, I got you.
[17:14.55]But, uh...
[17:16.82]Let me play.
[17:17.38]I'll only do one more and you guys can do it.
[17:24.17]Pizza song?
[17:26.73]This guy- Seaman doesn't have an OST.
[17:29.21]I don't think so.
[17:39.92]Play the theme from Margo's Wetnurse.
[17:45.83]Wait, isn't that the song that goes like... Yeah, this song's fucked up.
[17:53.73]Alright, I'll do one more and you guys can do one.
[17:59.59]3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, nope.
[18:07.08]Oh, wait, hold on.

[18:08.12]Actually, hold on here.

[18:24.16]What a creepy fucking stream this is.
[18:29.97]Hey guys, I'm just playing Picross and listening to weird, like, fucking lullaby music.
[18:36.44]Are you guys enjoying the stream?
[18:46.91]God, this went off the rails, huh?
[18:56.25]Uh, let's see, two, uh, could be, no, it has to be here.
[19:07.50]One, two, three, four, no.
[19:12.37]How many teeth do I have?

[19:13.55]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[19:16.77]I have 14 teeth.
[19:17.59]That's pretty good.
[19:19.51]What the hell is this?
[19:20.29]It's a cartoon.
[19:47.19]What kind of fucked up cartoon is this?
[19:56.01]Uh, one, two, one.
[20:00.57]What is this?
[20:04.62]Cartoon?
[20:09.22]Speech bubble.
[20:10.14]How would you get that?
[20:11.04]Did anybody get that?
[20:20.11]Alright, I'm gonna do one more and you guys do one.
[20:22.55]My last one.
[20:34.79]He's addicted.
[20:35.39]It is very addicting.
[20:36.25]This game is so addicting.
[20:40.39]I would put it in my top... Probably my top 250.
[20:43.35]7 to 8 out of 10 games I think I've played over my life.
[20:47.73]That I sometimes like to play sometimes.
[20:52.68]Wait, that's not true.
[20:53.84]This might be part of the... No, it has to be.
[20:59.41]One more.
[20:59.63]It's just like Crazy Taxi.
[21:00.83]We get to guess the picture together.
[21:02.65]See?
[21:02.81]This is probably a field goal.
[21:04.95]Alright, let's see.
[21:08.87]1, 1.
[21:08.97]Okay.
[21:09.15]There's 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[21:13.65]So, here we go.
[21:17.39]This one's for free.
[21:25.60]I love getting them for free.
[21:30.66]How long is this song?
[21:35.20]Might as well play the Winter Lantern singing.
[21:37.92]Oh, I remember how terrifying that was.
[21:41.44]The one that goes... Is that what's coming up?
[21:49.34]Now this is a real good one.
[21:50.60]This is the... This is Gehrman.
[21:53.67]Alright, spoiler alert if you haven't played Bloodborne.
[21:55.33]Fucking, it's one of the best games ever made.
[21:57.33]Go play it, and then come back and watch the stream.
[21:59.09]Try to beat it in, like, less than two or three hours.
[22:05.20]So that's one, one... it's probably four, yeah.
[22:14.88]No, no, like this.
[22:17.99]This is a drink.
[22:20.87]It's Glitch, the Twitch emote!
[22:29.86]Same deal.
[22:35.42]One, two, three, four, five.
[22:39.76]There's the three.
[22:43.02]What an unbelievable... Okay, can I just say, if Sekiro is even 10% of how fun and amazing I think Bloodborne was, it's going to be game of the century for me.
[23:02.85]It has to be here.
[23:03.77]I can see it coming together.
[23:14.17]2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, possibly.
[23:18.18]8, 1, 1.
[23:18.24]1, 1.
[23:18.48]It's got to be there.
[23:32.85]We've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[23:41.57]Here it comes.
[23:43.89]Yeah.
[23:44.93]The best part!
[23:45.81]The best part of the whole song!
[23:50.10]At the end of the games that I'm excited for.
[23:51.50]I mean, Sekiro is number one.
[23:57.22]I've been waiting for... I've been waiting for a FromSoftware game that's not Dark Souls.
[24:02.07]since Bloodborne released.
[24:04.50]And that's not to say there's anything wrong with Dark Souls.
[24:10.74]I just like when they do something a little different.
[24:16.71]Alright, what is it?
[24:18.13]We got it.
[24:18.55]Looks like a beer.
[24:23.13]Beer glass.
[24:24.53]Oh, some of you guys got fucking destroyed.
[24:28.07]One, two, three, four, five, six, so only seven or eight of you got it right.
[24:31.41]Alright, I'm gonna do one more and you guys can take it.
[24:38.93]Last one.
[24:42.18]That's one.
[24:44.72]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[24:49.74]It's our turn.
[24:50.48]I'll give you one more and you guys can get a goal.
[24:54.98]two three four five six seven eight not quite one three one one five I mean it kind of has to be here that doesn't help me very much though one two three four one two three four also part of a four and one
[25:23.21]He's never gonna let us have our turn.
[25:25.69]Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[25:27.43]No.
[25:27.73]Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[25:29.23]That has to be the three.
[25:36.62]And look at that.
[25:41.10]When you really solve it, it gets- it itches a part of your brain.
[25:45.95]So this is one, two, three, four.
[25:47.35]One, two Nev, can't be any of these.
[25:53.40]Let's go ahead and do this.
[25:55.96]Could be two and then six.
[25:57.36]Not sure.
[25:57.54]This is the most intense pictocross stream with this music.
[26:02.16]Yeah.
[26:03.64]I like it.
[26:06.87]It's think music.
[26:10.95]One, two, three, four, five.
[26:21.09]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[26:22.51]Yeah, that two and the six is free, right?
[26:23.91]Look at the one, three, one.
[26:29.47]One, two, three.
[26:30.55]This has to be part of the three, right?
[26:32.19]Because if it was one, two, three... No, this is the three here.
[26:38.31]Got the ones.
[26:39.73]This is also a one.
[26:40.59]There's a twoberger.
[26:41.09]There's a two.
[26:42.69]I think the same thing's going to happen here.
[26:44.05]It is three.
[26:46.91]Get that space down.
[26:48.19]And then there's a two.
[26:50.73]There's your six.
[26:54.21]Now let's see.
[26:54.69]There's three.
[26:56.07]This is part of the four.
[26:58.09]Has to be.
[26:58.59]There's your two.
[27:00.21]There's your one.
[27:03.69]What is this an image of?
[27:04.53]How do you go from that to Gwen?
[27:10.47]Come on, Gwen!
[27:12.59]Come on.
[27:16.55]Watch it, watch it.
[27:17.65]One, two, three.
[27:18.23]One, two, three, four.
[27:21.72]Come on, good.
[27:23.30]Come on.
[27:31.65]Got it.
[27:31.95]Okay.
[27:34.67]I'm gonna laugh if this is, like, Gingerbread House.
[27:38.89]Oh, we got it.
[27:39.69]A lot of you got it this time.
[27:42.29]Alright, alright, alright.
[27:43.27]It's time for you guys to play.
[27:46.11]This is Fruits.
[27:47.46]I'll make it.
[27:47.90]I'll give it to you right here.
[27:55.20]Have fun.
[27:58.26]Get it done.
[28:04.59]Every five, every like eight seconds it fills up whatever the most typed into chat.
[28:12.97]Write for it again.
[28:16.28]Did I get teleported like a week and a half ago?
[28:24.49]Did- I think I went through a wormhole, and I'm in the sea.
[28:27.95]Yeah, do the same thing.
[28:28.69]Alright, I'm telling you right now... If you guys fill this cube... You did it.
[28:41.85]You accomplished it, congratulations.
[28:44.27]But I'm taking control back for the rest of the stream.
[28:50.66]You beat the game at that point, you get the game over.
[28:59.04]You see the end credits.
[29:00.82]That's it.
[29:08.50]All of a sudden, everyone's like, oh, no, shit, wait, wait, remove that, remove it, remove it.
[29:12.18]He might be serious.
[29:13.92]Don't fuck with him today.
[29:15.28]He played a bootleg Dreamcast game.
[29:18.90]He's already on edge.
[29:34.42]I'm gonna get chat on screen.
[29:38.46]How do I do this?
[29:39.68]Can I pin this?
[29:43.85]How do I pin the chat window on top of this game?
[29:46.47]I can do that, right?
[29:52.58]Pin.
[29:54.10]Pin this window?
[30:09.64]Customize... Wait, how do I pin this?
[30:15.86]How do I- how do you just pin a Firefox tab?
[30:18.88]How- are you guys doing it?
[30:19.99]You know, you're clearing everything.
[30:20.91]Good.
[30:26.93]I actually don't know how fucking I can do this.
[30:33.09]The large vocal in wrong stream chat.
[30:39.25]I'm not judging anybody, what are you talking about?
[30:47.03]Right-click the top of the window?
[30:48.29]Alright, why don't you guys, uh, fill in the same thing over and over again?
[30:53.36]Uh, it's an- I think an add-on?
[31:14.90]Oh, that is a good one.
[31:20.52]Daughter of the Cosmos?
[31:21.36]That is... That's probably one of the better songs in the whole soundtrack.
[31:36.03]Alright, I'm about to... I'm about to grab the wheel.
[31:42.41]You guys have fallen asleep here.
[31:47.51]Like, come on.
[31:49.29]What is this?
[31:57.49]Take control back, please.
[32:08.04]I'm drawing Ebrutas.
[32:16.78]Stop, what do you mean stop?
[32:18.04]You guys, you guys just keep going like this!
[32:20.00]I, I, you just did it for me!
[32:29.72]You just did it while I was showing you!
[32:34.04]Alright, okay.
[32:39.31]Why would you clear this?
[32:42.07]We almost had it.
[32:43.03]Clean slate.
[32:45.68]Look, I'll leave what you guys did.
[32:47.75]Here.
[32:49.09]There you go.
[32:50.35]Oh, good.
[32:53.25]End the stream.
[32:54.53]No!
[33:02.28]Thoughts on the Halo Master Chief Collection coming to Steam?
[33:06.22]That's actually kind of cool, because I've never really played them.
[33:15.39]When is that expected to be there?
[33:28.12]This year, there's no date.
[33:29.52]Oh, that's cool, though.
[33:34.14]Yeah, back when Halo was a big deal.
[33:37.06]I mean, it's not like it's not anymore, but when it was a really big deal.
[33:41.91]I didn't have a regular Xbox.
[33:43.49]I didn't have...
[33:46.61]I had like a 64, PlayStation 2.
[33:50.71]What is in the Master Chief Collection?
[33:55.27]You guys are going into the second phase.
[33:57.23]Yeah.
[34:01.21]Alright.
[34:03.37]It's every single one but up to five.
[34:06.74]Wow.
[34:09.94]I thought it was just the first three.
[34:11.24]That's kind of cool.
[34:12.80]Are you guys... Are you doing it?
[34:15.48]Am I about to assume control?
[34:19.42]That's it?
[34:20.22]This is gonna be it?
[34:23.11]You win.
[34:24.25]Congratulations, you filled the cube.
[34:34.05]Look it, you did it.
[34:36.95]You see the credits, here they are.
[34:42.19]This song.
[34:54.14]Alright, alright, I'm gonna fix this.
[34:56.72]This is a fruit.
[35:04.32]Alright, here the question is, how much is left in the song?
[35:08.07]No, I can't beat this in 10 seconds, never mind.
[35:09.79]What's next coming up here?
[35:14.63]Uh, what's the next Bloodborne song?
[35:17.65]Oh, this is, uh, Mikolaj.
[35:19.28]Mikolaj.
[35:23.89]No, this one's too scary.
[35:24.67]I don't want this one.
[35:30.71]Koss, or some say Kossum.
[35:34.97]Grant us eyes, grant us eyes, grant us eyes.
[35:39.09]Gas coin's a good song.
[35:47.87]Alright, let me fix this.
[35:55.67]Boom, boom, boom.
[35:56.96]We've got five, one, two, three, four, five.
[36:03.58]This is going to be part of the four.
[36:04.68]You've got one, two, three, four.
[36:06.20]It can't be here.
[36:06.92]That's really the only thing I can do.
[36:11.40]I want you in my room.
[36:12.98]Why?
[36:13.16]What are you talking about?
[36:15.08]Oh, that's the boom, boom, boom, boom.
[36:17.93]I want you in my room.
[36:21.83]That song?
[36:27.61]One space.
[36:28.79]One, two, three.
[36:35.08]Play that.
[36:35.48]I'll play that after this.
[36:36.94]We're going full-on copyright stream.
[36:40.00]I mean, the title of this is now Throw in the Towel, right?
[36:50.40]Is that part of the one of the seven?
[36:52.60]I don't know.
[36:55.37]Destroy the VOD.
[36:56.77]No, I don't want to destroy it.
[37:01.69]Two, two, maybe.
[37:05.88]Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[37:08.04]Not quite.
[37:12.86]Hi, VOD, can you hear me?
[37:14.36]I have this one, two, three, four, one, so it can't be any of these.
[37:27.78]Give us back control.
[37:33.04]No.
[37:35.88]Hmm.
[37:36.30]I wonder which one this is.
[37:41.41]This is probably part of the four.
[37:43.99]No, this is... I'm gonna... Yeah, this is four.
[37:46.55]That's three.
[37:48.83]This is probably the seven.
[37:50.81]Yes, it is.
[37:55.42]Riot until he gives it back.
[37:58.88]I don't think you're gonna get it.
[38:01.34]Sorry.
[38:02.70]You beat the game.
[38:03.50]You did what you were trying to do.
[38:04.74]That's four.
[38:11.61]What does that do?
[38:13.17]Five.
[38:13.65]One, two, three, four, five.
[38:20.13]Let them play.
[38:21.83]They did.
[38:23.01]And they won.
[38:24.39]They did a great job.
[38:27.06]I was very proud...
[38:31.89]I was so happy.
[38:41.22]It was wondrous what they've done.
[38:46.64]What was I going to put on?
[38:47.32]Does anybody know what the name of that song is?
[38:51.41]Is it just called Boom Boom Boom?
[38:54.19]Or is it called I Want You In My Room?
[39:03.98]There it is.
[39:09.72]This is when it goes... We like to party.
[39:12.18]We like, we like to party.
[39:13.06]Right?
[39:13.36]No, that's different.
[39:40.48]Look, I already threw in the towel.
[39:41.54]I don't even have to explain myself.
[39:52.17]Louder.
[39:52.63]I don't know the lyrics at all.
[40:19.25]Here it comes!
[40:20.53]Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[40:22.57]I want you in my room.
[40:27.75]And then here's the Minecraft part.
[40:38.13]Yep.
[40:41.17]Sorry, what is it?
[40:42.79]A grenade?
[40:43.27]Doesn't happen.
[41:01.28]So, um, last night when I was going to bed.
[41:05.61]Oh, I forgot to tell you about my dream!
[41:07.19]Oh my god, is that this dream is fucking worth sticking around for.
[41:10.47]I hope you stayed here from the beginning of the stream.
[41:13.37]If you left and you were like, oh fuck, this is kind of all fucked up, we'll try again tomorrow.
[41:16.78]No, you've stuck around for this long, you're gonna get one of the most ridiculous dreams I've ever had.
[41:21.40]So, listen to this.
[41:24.78]I'm in my bedroom, and there's a knock at my door.
[41:30.15]I go to look through the peephole, and there's a bunch of company.
[41:33.81]Oh, there's people coming over.
[41:35.81]Oh, my house is not ready.
[41:37.65]Oh, just a minute!
[41:38.67]Right?
[41:38.89]Hold on a second.
[41:39.70]And I'm like picking up underwear on the floor and grabbing shit and throwing stuff in the laundry.
[41:44.88]What's over here?
[41:46.52]Sweep, sweep, right?
[41:47.80]There is dog shit all over the floor and all outside, right?
[41:53.11]So I'm picking up shit with my bare hands.
[41:57.25]Just picking up, like, a pile of, like, auto shit.
[42:00.11]Pile of auto shit.
[42:01.25]Pile of auto shit.
[42:02.89]And I go to answer the door.
[42:06.19]And I'm cupping, like, five or six shits in my hand.
[42:10.87]Like, to try to magician hide them.
[42:12.61]Like, as if they're not there.
[42:14.43]It stinks wicked fucking bad.
[42:16.82]It's unbearable.
[42:17.90]And I'm holding them, like, down below behind me.
[42:21.59]And I open the door and everyone kind of starts to come in like, oh, hey, how are you?
[42:26.37]Oh, good to see you again.
[42:28.38]Yeah, well, you put that, you put your jacket over there.
[42:30.22]And I have like a wad of shit in my hand and nobody really knows yet.
[42:35.40]I spend the next what seemed to be 20 to 30 straight minutes.
[42:40.29]I couldn't get out.
[42:41.17]I couldn't like sneak out to the bathroom.
[42:43.01]I couldn't go upstairs.
[42:44.13]I couldn't, no, no, no, no.
[42:45.11]I'm greeting people coming in and like hiding this fucking baseball of shit.
[42:50.69]And everybody, I am doing so good.
[42:52.99]I'm getting the hang of this.
[42:55.47]No one is stopping to like look at my hand.
[42:59.96]This is brain power.
[43:00.66]We already heard this.
[43:02.32]So finally, I get an opportunity to like, yeah, oh, hey, hi, Mary, how are you?
[43:07.13]I have to hug this lady.
[43:09.55]Like, oh, she comes in for a hug.
[43:10.81]I got to, what am I going to do?
[43:12.57]I've got two hands here.
[43:13.67]One of them has a wad of dog shit.
[43:15.63]So I put my hand around and I do like the hover hand on one side and like pat with the right hand.
[43:22.56]Now, somebody else looks over here and sees me.
[43:27.32]What's happening?
[43:28.26]What's in my hand?
[43:29.86]And I have this little like, yeah, but they didn't, I don't know.
[43:31.98]I don't think they really grasped what it was.
[43:34.08]They just, I kind of had like eye beams going towards my left hand.
[43:38.71]It was holding like a martini glass.
[43:39.81]Like what the fuck is he doing?
[43:41.41]And I'm like, I'll be right back.
[43:43.41]And I run into the bathroom.
[43:44.65]Then I finally get in there and I think I'm like safe.
[43:46.39]And I just like this, I go like this, right?
[43:51.26]I go like, into the toilet.
[43:54.10]I don't know why, I could have just placed it, but I like, I like yo-yo it down.
[43:58.18]Like, into the fucking toilet.
[44:01.79]And my hand is just, it's just caked with shit.
[44:06.65]And that's when I woke up.
[44:09.65]Glad he stuck around for that one.
[44:14.17]It was the most panic-induced, and I thought it was real, right?
[44:16.48]Everybody, you always think a dream is real while it's happening.
[44:22.44]But somewhere in that halfway to end of that dream, I could feel that people knew what was going on.
[44:30.26]And that's the panic there.
[44:34.52]I forgot it was a dream.
[44:45.91]I was there for that.
[44:47.45]No, it was fucking ridiculous.
[44:52.53]And first of all, the number one thing you have to remember, why is there a party going on at my house?
[44:56.89]Why are there like a dozen fucking people coming in, one after the other, shaking hands?
[45:01.27]And why is there shit all over my whole house?
[45:04.65]Like dog poo everywhere.
[45:05.90]What kind of fucked up slob am I?
[45:10.42]And then I thought about it.
[45:12.14]And after, I'm streaming tomorrow.
[45:15.26]But after tomorrow, I'm going to be taking like probably three or four days off because I have like friends coming up.
[45:20.64]Maybe that's why I had that drink.
[45:25.78]That's probably why.
[45:26.40]Anyways, back to the game.
[45:34.22]Yeah, it's a prophecy.
[45:36.14]Just make sure there's no fucking dog shit all over the place.
[45:42.33]Take Otto out.
[45:46.87]I have such weird dreams.
[45:47.93]My dreams always just don't make any sense.
[45:52.71]I told you guys about the Gordon Ramsay one, where I didn't know if we were going to split the bill or not, right?
[45:56.82]That happened, like, last week, two weeks ago.
[45:59.30]What the fuck am I... What's wrong with my brain?
[46:01.32]Alright, this one kind of got me here.
[46:09.40]6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[46:10.20]Alright, get that on this one.
[46:15.90]This one's 5.
[46:17.35]So, 1, 2, this can be blocked.
[46:25.96]Is this the legendary PictoPic streamer?
[46:27.74]Yeah?
[46:29.40]I wouldn't say legendary.
[46:30.38]Can't be this one.
[46:39.72]Oh, what am I doing?
[46:50.35]You're legendary to me.
[46:51.49]Thank you.
[46:55.12]Thanks.
[46:55.42]No, seriously.
[46:55.96]Thank you.
[47:00.89]So tomorrow, on tomorrow's stream, we're probably going to have a little bit better luck.
[47:11.74]I have a couple of plans for tomorrow.
[47:13.84]We'll see if they happen or not.
[47:16.12]I'm not done streaming tonight.
[47:16.98]Don't worry.
[47:17.46]We're still going.
[47:24.32]Is that gonna... No, is that impossible for me to do that?
[47:27.90]1, 2, 3... No, I can't figure that out from here.
[47:30.24]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[47:30.42]No.
[47:33.06]Alright, I got... 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, can't... Let's just mark X's.
[47:41.87]It's not really gonna help that much, but it's okay.
[47:43.83]2, 1...
[47:51.93]5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[47:53.83]Same deal on this one.
[47:54.87]Now, the question is, is this 1, 2, 3, 4, 5?
[47:56.33]No, this is part of the 5.
[47:57.63]There's your 2.
[47:59.28]Hmm.
[47:59.48]3, 4.
[47:59.58]There's your 5.
[48:01.16]Close it.
[48:19.34]Wow, you blocked the spam.
[48:20.86]Thanks, idiot.
[48:22.68]Huh?
[48:26.15]Oh, people are spamming the song.
[48:28.27]I get it.
[48:30.55]I get it.
[48:33.32]I forgot there was music playing.
[48:37.30]This is wrong.
[48:37.86]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[48:39.82]What happened here?
[48:40.36]This is wrong.
[48:42.26]How did I do this?
[48:48.44]Oh fuck, this is completely wrong.
[48:49.82]Shit, what was the last thing I did?
[48:55.84]Uh-oh.
[49:02.81]Oh no, what did I do wrong here?
[49:04.43]That's two, right?
[49:07.25]Two.
[49:08.75]Let me just do, I think I can fix it a little bit later.
[49:10.75]Let me just see what happens here.
[49:14.92]One of these bros is wrong, but it's okay.
[49:18.31]Two, two, oh no, this is the row that's wrong.
[49:25.79]That's why, okay.
[49:26.73]Because this has to be two down like that.
[49:34.70]Alright, I got it, I think I fixed it.
[49:38.38]Two, two, one, fuck, this is so wrong.
[49:47.03]How the f- how do I fuck this up this badly?
[49:56.60]Oh, nice B. This is so- look at how incorrect this is!
[50:02.23]1, 2, 3, 4, 5!
[50:04.25]Spe- WHAT?! !
[50:17.50]Something went so horribly wrong.
[50:21.12]Oh, I gotta restart it.
[50:28.92]Sometimes you just have to detonate it and come and do it again.
[50:36.53]What's next?
[50:38.99]I don't know what that is.
[50:44.18]I'm so unreasonably sad about Space Channel.
[50:46.34]Me too.
[50:49.46]It's okay, though.
[50:51.56]Can't happen every time.
[50:53.14]Even if you're playing something, it doesn't matter.
[50:54.92]It's okay.
[50:56.25]There's always next time.
[50:58.83]You know?
[50:59.15]There's always another day.
[51:00.31]It's... Don't worry.
[51:01.17]Everything's fine.
[51:01.85]I'm good.
[51:02.27]I feel great.
[51:03.03]I feel great right now.
[51:04.07]I really do.
[51:09.83]What's another good... What's another little soundtrack?
[51:16.94]Put on the Six Flags song.
[51:18.10]It's called We Like to Party, right?
[51:26.62]Put on the Venga bus.
[51:33.63]You know, people ask career advice sometimes, and what I should do.
[51:39.77]If you had advice, Jerma, what would it be?
[51:42.15]Honest to fucking God?
[51:45.51]Write a song.
[51:47.41]That is catchy as fuck.
[51:50.51]And collect royalties for the next 2,000 years.
[51:54.25]Your entire family will be... Just make a song like this.
[51:58.34]Just make one song that plays on Six Flags commercials.
[52:02.14]You only need one.
[52:03.72]You don't need an album full of great music.
[52:05.80]Just make one good song.
[52:09.15]And then Seinfeld it until you die.
[52:19.14]Just spend every waking moment of your life trying to come up with one catchy song.
[52:28.39]That's pretty bad advice.
[52:29.39]Don't take that advice.
[52:42.67]Collected fucking royalties forever, FOREVER!
[52:47.97]We get a check for like $100,000 every year for this one fucking song.
[52:53.19]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[53:15.26]That's wrong.
[53:18.13]paid now happiness is just around the corner hey now hey now hear what I say now we'll be there three thousand people are doing it right what alright let me I got I I'm this song is getting me it's just catchy alright so we got five two I screwed it up here last time
[53:52.92]That's how I fucked it up before.
[53:55.44]Now I understand.
[53:56.12]Because I did 5-5-1 instead of 5-1-down.
[54:01.63]That's where it all went so wrong.
[54:08.43]There we go.
[54:09.23]Fixed.
[54:17.60]Okay.
[54:29.45]When was the last time you guys went to Six Flags?
[54:33.26]Now do it at 50% speed.
[54:34.52]Is this still fun?
[54:48.99]It sounds like a different song!
[55:13.34]Don't you just want to fucking make this go faster?
[55:17.12]In my brain, it's trying to be as fast as it should be and it's not letting it.
[55:22.69]I hate this.
[55:27.97]This has to be here.
[55:28.97]1, 2, 3, because there's no way.
[55:31.51]Even if it's 5, or even, wait, this might be 5 here, then I'm... No, okay, even if this is the end, 2 has to be here.
[55:53.92]4, 4.
[55:54.24]Here's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[55:56.71]Alright, I got it now.
[56:06.49]People are going to leave.
[56:09.00]I've gained viewers since this song has been on.
[56:11.50]Huh.
[56:11.92]Let's see if that holds true.
[56:18.48]I'm going 0.5, boys and girls.
[56:53.13]Alright, that hurt.
[56:53.67]That's giving me, like, anxiety.
[56:55.53]I need to stop doing that.
[56:56.71]Oh, goddammit.
[57:20.42]I'm so sorry.
[57:23.18]I'm so sorry.
[57:24.04]It's not what I wanted today.
[57:39.40]This is not what I wanted!
[57:40.84]Did anybody get it right?
[57:50.14]Okay, I'm stopping this.
[57:52.14]Ah, some of you guys got it right.
[57:56.50]Alright, let's do like a 15x15.
[57:57.32]Let's do like a 20x20.
[57:58.32]Let's get a real one.
[57:59.08]Why is this so slow?
[58:20.41]Oh, right, cause it's still... What's going on?!
[58:47.24]Dude, times two speed?
[58:48.28]No, I want people to keep their brain cells.
[58:56.87]Pump it up.
[58:57.61]No, I don't want to be that loud.
[58:58.69]I'm gonna wake up my neighbors.
[59:01.32]I want you in my room.
[59:09.76]Wait.
[59:11.12]Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[59:13.21]I want you in my room.
[59:14.87]We'll spend the night together.
[59:16.69]Together in my room.
[59:19.57]Boom.
[59:19.87]Boom.
[59:24.49]What this is the same song That's where I guess I'm gonna call it there right there What else what's this one the coconut song what does it say 69 million views what is this The coconut song
[59:55.11]70 fucking million views?
[59:57.57]Nah, I don't see the appeal.
[60:00.46]Uh, alright, what's this one?
[60:28.22]It just says coconut, coca, coconut, coconut.
[60:38.31]What the fuck is this stream?
[60:40.11]This is called throwing in the towel.
[60:44.31]Let's, alright, fine.
[60:45.03]I'll give it another chance.
[60:53.08]Alright, this is actually, I like it.
[60:55.62]I've never heard this.
[60:56.80]Oh.
[61:22.51]This is probably one.
[61:25.79]Yeah, this is one.
[61:28.25]No, I don't know.
[61:29.61]It might not be.
[61:32.99]Three, space one.
[61:36.23]Don't have a lot of info to go on in this one.
[61:39.51]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[61:43.80]Oh, coconut.
[61:45.02]Oh, oh, oh, coconut.
[61:50.40]I don't have any info.
[61:52.72]I have info for this.
[61:54.10]One, two, three.
[61:55.42]One, two, three.
[61:56.52]I just don't know.
[61:57.66]This is 70 million views.
[61:58.80]I need more info.
[62:00.36]Okay.
[62:18.70]Where's my nut button?
[62:20.10]That's a good question.
[62:21.54]I'm stuck here on this one.
[62:23.78]Because pretty much anywhere I go would be technically incorrect without just guessing.
[62:46.15]let's just assume that this is one does that help us at all it kind of does assuming that this is one and not one two that's a great song but I can't uh I need to think what else we got here
[63:16.71]It was just getting good.
[63:18.09]No Crazy Frog.
[63:19.21]I did Beat Saber Crazy Frog.
[63:20.73]I'm not going back to that hill.
[63:31.82]No, not the duck song.
[63:33.86]I always, I always never liked that song.
[63:43.10]Um...
[63:46.34]You can always put the left crosser regardless of 1 and 2.
[63:48.58]Yeah, that's true.
[63:54.73]I got one for you.
[63:59.03]You're going to just... I'm going to play this.
[64:01.53]Everybody here right now, maybe you have some questions on whether or not... I don't know if I like this guy.
[64:07.16]I've been here for a little while.
[64:08.36]Maybe I've been around for a long time, but I'm having doubts that maybe this guy knows how to run a stream or not.
[64:13.06]Like, what a fucking idiot.
[64:14.52]I'm about to change everyone's opinion because you're going to hear me play this song and you're going to go, I automatically enjoy everything he's ever said or ever will do or ever will say.
[64:22.63]Okay?
[64:23.31]Just making sure you guys are aware of that.
[64:26.11]Right now.
[64:39.48]Let's see.
[64:41.24]So that goes, let's see, that's four now.
[64:45.24]Alright, we're good?
[64:51.35]Oops, oops, oops!
[65:57.38]Alright, it's 60%.
[65:58.16]That's fine.
[66:02.22]That's fine.
[66:03.54]I got a better idea.
[66:11.65]How about now?
[66:15.29]How about now?
[66:25.54]What is it?
[66:27.96]How many people said... 27% said highly negative.
[66:38.21]I mean, you did that for the joke.
[66:39.13]I appreciate it nonetheless.
[66:48.17]Play another remix of this song.
[67:03.41]Play the right version.
[67:05.39]What do I mean the right version?
[67:06.63]All versions are good.
[67:10.17]Every version of this song is fantastic.
[67:19.66]This is incorrect.
[67:39.83]What song is it?
[67:40.41]This is the Moon theme from DuckTales Remastered.
[67:48.53]Who knows what's coming up next?
[67:52.60]Did I blow this?
[67:54.82]I may have.
[68:02.95]Has to be here.
[68:05.71]I may have blown this.
[68:06.49]I'm not going to say I didn't.
[68:15.09]I blew it.
[68:17.15]Maybe not.
[68:22.75]I blew it.
[68:25.67]Shit, what have I done?
[68:26.77]I was too busy, pants into the mood, just restarted.
[68:44.99]Alright, I fucked it up.
[68:45.99]Oh, that's good.
[68:46.84]It's okay, it's okay.
[68:55.46]Where was the first one?
[68:57.08]I don't remember.
[68:58.82]1, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[69:00.86]Block it.
[69:02.52]1, 2, 3, 4.
[69:03.64]Block this.
[69:05.68]This is just JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
[69:08.66]No, no, no.
[69:11.78]I was about to mute it.
[69:18.97]She better be Smash Bros.
[69:21.71]DLC.
[69:22.01]Seriously.
[69:23.03]I don't want another Fire Emblem character.
[69:25.99]This song is very bad.
[69:49.73]I didn't say it, you did.
[69:51.49]Alright, I gotta pay attention to my fucking newspaper game from the 80s!
[69:58.64]Distraction, distracting, distracting, distracting!
[70:10.63]What did I do the last time?
[70:12.07]I did, um... It was five... I don't remember, this is assuming this is one, right?
[70:39.20]Cause then... No!
[70:42.55]No, this is not right.
[70:44.37]It's not correct!
[70:47.97]You have all the info to solve row B. I know, but I keep hearing jump into the air.
[70:54.75]And my fucking split personality brain is dancing right now.
[71:00.72]There's a part of my brain that is doing like the swing, like, oh, spin around, grab that person by the arm, go around, like the tap dancing and shit.
[71:08.59]And then there's another part that's sitting here trying to do math.
[71:14.69]There's two people sitting here right now.
[71:16.83]One of them is having a great time dancing at some fucking wedding.
[71:20.11]And the other one's playing a game on stream.
[71:29.31]I'm just ripped in half.
[71:33.09]Alright, so that means we have one, two, three, four.
[71:36.28]I had it last time.
[71:42.38]So B7... It can't be there.
[71:48.61]I mean, it could, because that's one and then it's basically two.
[71:53.91]Stop.
[71:54.15]I have to stop.
[71:54.67]I have to get out.
[71:55.11]I have to leave the wedding.
[71:55.83]Alright, come back to me.
[71:59.07]Come on, like, back in.
[72:01.55]Sit in here.
[72:02.21]I need both of you here.
[72:03.93]Not just one.
[72:06.51]Together.
[72:10.48]I'm like Majin Buu.
[72:13.24]Just all of you get back in here for like a couple minutes and then I promise you can just go back to what you were doing.
[72:19.86]Okay.
[72:21.66]So.
[72:25.63]This is one, two, three.
[72:27.51]One, two, three.
[72:28.41]Let's get rid of, no, I don't know.
[72:29.85]Okay, this, no.
[72:33.27]We're here.
[72:34.95]One, let's see.
[72:37.57]One, two, three, four.
[72:41.76]I just don't know which side this is on.
[72:43.30]It can't be this.
[72:44.10]Okay.
[72:44.22]Alright.
[72:44.72]Okay.
[72:45.06]Alright.
[72:45.38]Alright.
[72:45.60]Everything's fine.
[72:49.44]See, he sat back down.
[72:55.65]So then that's three, one.
[72:56.81]Now the question is, where's this other three?
[73:05.90]So this is the one.
[73:06.98]Yeah.
[73:08.60]Yeah.
[73:10.54]This could, okay.
[73:11.54]There's your four, right?
[73:12.90]1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[73:13.64]Hold on 1, 2, 3, 4, 1.
[73:14.05]I don't know that info.
[73:17.93]Pull that back for a second.
[73:19.55]1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[73:21.69]I don't know that info.
[73:23.03]Okay.
[73:23.17]That leaves us with.
[73:41.31]one I have it now okay alright get that go ahead go you can go you can go you can go you can go are you sure yeah you're fine just if I need you again I'll call you back really yeah go thanks man right right alright come here you're breaking it thanks a lot man go have fun
[74:16.01]There's two, there's three... No, I fucked it up again!
[74:22.53]I need you... Stop!
[74:23.77]Get back here!
[74:24.41]No, get back in, get back in!
[74:25.90]No, stop, stop, stop, back, back, back, back, back, get back in here!
[74:28.00]This has gotta be three!
[74:30.56]This is wrong!
[74:32.40]This has to be three!
[74:34.44]This is incorrect!
[74:37.63]You see what I'm talking about?
[74:41.41]What did I do again that was wrong?
[74:42.73]Because see, this is what it was.
[74:46.09]This is impossible.
[74:47.43]That's not possible.
[74:48.15]That can't be right.
[74:49.41]So... This is just wrong.
[75:03.04]And the question is, where did it go wrong?
[75:16.87]Where did it go so... This is wrong.
[75:20.84]Let me just pull this back.
[75:23.74]God damn it.
[75:27.60]Am I pretending?
[75:28.46]No, I'm just tired.
[75:31.67]It went wrong with D7, did it?
[75:33.39]I gotta fucking restart it again.
[75:47.29]Every time I see it because blah.
[75:55.57]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, right?
[75:57.65]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[75:58.78]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[75:59.86]We have this because of this information.
[76:01.22]That's all I have right now.
[76:11.04]That's what it was before.
[76:14.06]So now, this is where it goes off the rails for me every time.
[76:17.30]And I don't know why.
[76:18.23]Sometimes, okay, I blow through some of these and then some of them I just get stuck.
[76:24.55]So there's no, four has to be here.
[76:27.17]It has to be one, two, three, four.
[76:29.71]This is what it has to be.
[76:34.68]This is as far as I got before it was just,
[76:43.69]Now, this is a one.
[76:47.85]That's the middle one.
[76:48.71]There's one down here, and then three is up here somewhere.
[76:55.52]Alright.
[76:56.00]Now, three... Wait, are you shitting me?
[77:05.01]I think I just got it.
[77:06.35]Right there.
[77:08.15]I think I just got it.
[77:15.45]Wrong?
[77:16.15]Is it wrong?
[77:25.00]Why am I crossing out D5?
[77:28.44]Because look, see?
[77:30.86]It's 3, because I think this is the 1, right?
[77:36.99]Otherwise, this can't be the 3.
[77:39.31]This can't be the last one.
[77:40.25]This is the middle one.
[77:41.27]D5 is getting crossed out because it's the 1.
[77:44.80]It could be the 3, but if no, if it's a 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1.
[77:48.50]No, it can't be the 3.
[77:50.46]3 is above here.
[77:55.80]1, 2, 3, because then there's a space, 1.
[77:57.62]I mean, I guess it could, I guess it could, it could.
[77:59.66]Because then this would be this.
[78:09.19]No, but that doesn't work either, see?
[78:11.81]Because now it has to be here.
[78:15.15]which would then be one, which is impossible.
[78:21.35]See what I'm saying?
[78:29.64]Because it's three, then one, then one.
[78:32.50]So if it was like that, then that would mean it would have to be either here or here.
[78:37.48]And if it's here, no.
[78:38.68]If it's here, you only got one.
[78:41.12]You can't do two here.
[78:55.65]It's probably this.
[78:58.87]That's realistically.
[78:59.81]Because then let's take a look.
[79:06.26]That covers that.
[79:07.78]Here's this row.
[79:08.66]Let me just see what that looks like now.
[79:17.45]Okay.
[79:18.69]That looks right.
[79:23.01]Yeah, that's right.
[79:23.57]Okay.
[79:24.37]We're good.
[79:28.21]Fucking puzzles, man.
[79:43.44]One, two, three, four.
[79:45.10]One, two.
[79:46.22]One, two, three, four.
[79:47.86]Alright.
[79:52.31]Now, the question is, is this way or that way?
[79:54.95]I don't know yet.
[79:58.13]But this is five, so one, two, three, four, five.
[80:01.63]One, two, three, four, five.
[80:09.54]I believe is correct, which would be one and then three.
[80:17.13]Right?
[80:18.05]Okay.
[80:18.67]And that ends this.
[80:21.37]And that ends that.
[80:26.26]What's coming up next?
[80:27.70]A Cowboy Bebop, apparently.
[80:36.16]Alright, now we can do this.
[80:38.92]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7!
[80:39.28]Here's the... 4 has to be right here.
[80:40.92]There's the 2.
[80:55.42]Alright, that's done.
[81:03.66]This is done.
[81:04.18]And here's the two.
[81:09.54]And then here's the two.
[81:12.21]Beautiful.
[81:12.63]There's the one.
[81:14.43]Alright, what the hell?
[81:16.15]What animal is this?
[81:17.23]That took a long time.
[81:18.55]Oh, is it a rooster?
[81:34.25]That was not a chicken.
[81:36.01]It could have been.
[81:36.55]Alright, what we got?
[81:41.29]Seven, eight, nine.
[81:42.87]We can go, let's see, one.
[81:44.57]So just by deducing it with our logical brains.
[81:47.24]Let's just say one is here.
[81:50.38]That's space one.
[81:51.68]So let's mark this just for a second.
[81:53.16]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[81:57.17]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[81:57.59]1, 2, 3, 4.
[81:57.67]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[81:57.95]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[81:58.11]Got big bits coming?
[81:59.01]I missed it?
[82:00.71]Oh, Jesus.
[82:00.95]Freudian Weapon.
[82:01.69]Freudian Weapon has just earned the 50,000 bits badge.
[82:28.90]50,000.
[82:29.60]Thank you for the 50 bucks.
[82:34.52]5,000 bits per audience.
[82:36.06]Really appreciate it.
[82:38.48]And thank you for the 50 fucking thousand.
[82:42.68]This song is terrible.
[82:43.62]Skip it.
[82:43.98]Alright, one guy.
[82:44.80]You get to be the one guy sometimes.
[82:45.96]I don't... What is... The Whiplash soundtrack?
[82:53.67]What is this?
[83:00.44]I don't know what this is.
[83:02.66]This is more whiplash.
[83:08.18]Um... I'm just gonna... Whatever.
[83:13.14]This is just jazz.
[83:17.76]But thank you, Frodeon, for your massive contributions to the stream.
[83:24.07]It's... That's a shitload of money.
[83:25.69]I can never expect somebody to fucking pay me that much money.
[83:27.95]Thank you.
[83:38.48]Is this their influence?
[83:39.40]Let's go get two somewhere in here.
[83:46.89]Two, one.
[83:49.49]One, no.
[83:50.99]One, one, three, three.
[83:52.13]So we got this blocked off.
[83:53.23]This helps us a little.
[83:54.09]One, two, three.
[83:54.91]And then down here.
[83:58.76]One, two, three.
[83:59.72]Alright, that's all I have for now.
[84:07.15]No.
[84:08.43]Two, two?
[84:11.27]Two, one.
[84:12.77]What else do I got here?
[84:17.01]This is probably the one, it is, right?
[84:19.92]Well, that takes away that two.
[84:23.60]Which then brings us to three, and then two, there it is.
[84:29.37]So we got three and three again.
[84:30.57]One, two, three, space.
[84:35.01]Yep.
[84:35.41]1, 2, 3.
[84:35.69]Space 1, 2, 3.
[84:38.85]This is an animal again.
[84:49.31]We got two.
[84:50.73]He fucked it up again.
[84:52.61]He fucked it up again.
[84:59.33]Where is it?
[85:08.60]Fucked it up again.
[85:22.15]Fuck!
[85:22.83]What did I do?
[85:25.03]It's right here somewhere.
[85:26.35]Let me think.
[85:28.99]I went too fast.
[85:29.84]So this is... 1, 3, 2.
[85:39.12]So hold on a minute here.
[85:40.02]This can't... No, this is fucked up.
[86:09.64]No!
[86:10.78]What am I missing?
[86:11.58]I've gotta go backwards again.
[86:13.32]Let me see.
[86:27.92]Ay!
[86:28.54]Okay, hold on.
[86:29.18]What happened there?
[86:33.44]One?
[86:36.95]Or is this wrong?
[86:46.56]One is this this is still I don't think this is this is not right.
[86:50.20]This is wrong here No, it's all fucked up I did something fucking stupid somewhere I
[87:19.31]I have to do it again.
[87:20.45]I gotta reset it.
[87:21.01]I just fucking... peed my pants.
[87:31.76]Let me start again.
[87:32.38]Alright, I can't handle this.
[87:37.86]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[87:43.87]One space.
[87:46.81]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[87:49.58]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[87:52.64]1.
[87:52.78]There it is.
[87:53.46]Alright, where did I go again?
[87:54.74]Shit.
[88:05.87]Boomer needs a diaper.
[88:08.87]I probably will after this.
[88:13.10]Just hand it over to the 70-year-old lady who comes into my Olive Garden at 11 a.m.
[88:16.31]every single day.
[88:16.87]She solves these like they're nothing.
[88:20.31]Well, I'm going to make that joke funnier because she probably does it for seven hours a day every single day.
[88:27.59]She's probably done every single Picross puzzle that has ever existed.
[88:30.40]She's probably done 50,000 of them.
[88:33.16]She's been doing that since she was like 52.
[88:36.26]She's got two decades of fucking experience.
[88:38.58]She may as well get signed to a fucking esports team.
[88:45.45]Anyways, where were we?
[88:46.45]One.
[88:46.71]There it is.
[88:54.13]Big brained grandma.
[88:55.64]Okay, this is done.
[89:01.90]I went off the rails here somewhere.
[89:03.22]Let's find out how.
[89:06.34]This is probably not... This might be the one.
[89:08.67]Oh, that might be part of the three.
[89:09.79]No, it's not.
[89:11.85]Gotta fill it all in.
[89:12.63]Okay.
[89:14.09]one this has to be the one because this is one that has to be that
[89:43.45]Okay.
[89:48.50]So now... Do I miss Boston?
[89:52.22]Sometimes, yeah.
[89:53.46]Depending.
[89:58.64]How is C7 filled in?
[90:03.76]Because, well, this is what I did.
[90:06.78]So if it's 7 space 1, then you have to assume that there's a 1 and there's a space.
[90:11.38]So let's just say it's here, right?
[90:15.40]There has to be a space here, therefore the 7 has to be somewhere in here.
[90:19.02]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[90:20.46]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[90:20.82]So that's why this is filled right now.
[90:36.43]Good, Jeremy, very good.
[90:38.61]Yes, I use my brain.
[90:43.21]So now, alright, let me focus for a second.
[90:47.44]Two, one, and that looks pretty perfect, but... Because I had the, last time it was two, I had the two filled in here.
[90:55.28]And it's probably here.
[91:02.08]What a smart lad.
[91:12.75]I think that, okay, I'm getting, I'm on the right track here.
[91:14.73]So that's, here's the two.
[91:16.75]Yep.
[91:17.11]So this is where I went wrong before.
[91:27.36]Can't be here.
[91:30.78]So this has to be over here.
[91:36.96]So then this two is down here somewhere.
[91:48.48]There it is.
[91:48.98]And there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[91:54.02]I finally got my brain around this one.
[92:04.45]Don't know any of these yet.
[92:05.41]So one, hold on, one.
[92:11.53]One, two, three.
[92:12.83]So one, two, three, one, two, three.
[92:18.16]The two is done.
[92:18.92]There goes this row.
[92:19.52]Alright.
[92:20.32]Let's get it.
[92:20.76]Let's speed it up.
[92:24.03]You guys have had lots of time to guess this one.
[92:29.43]Here's the two.
[92:30.05]Here's the three.
[92:37.40]But you haven't had any idea what the hell it is.
[92:44.92]2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3.
[92:45.50]2 is there somewhere.
[92:48.32]1, 2.
[92:48.36]Alright.
[92:48.76]2, 2, 1, 2, 2.
[92:52.44]1, 2, 1, 2.
[92:52.74]1, 2.
[92:52.80]2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1.
[92:52.98]1, 2.
[92:53.02]2, 2, 1.
[93:15.38]It's gonna be Surprise Pikachu.
[93:17.20]1, 2, 3, 4.
[93:19.28]1, 2, 3, 4.
[93:20.54]That does that.
[93:24.36]See you later.
[93:25.16]See you later.
[93:26.68]See you later.
[93:27.84]Okay, see you later.
[93:31.81]And see you later.
[93:33.47]Finally.
[93:36.39]Finally, this dope did it.
[93:39.99]You ever play Keep Talking and nobody explodes?
[93:41.54]I actually own it for VR.
[93:43.26]I'm gonna wait till... somebody wants to play.
[93:48.24]Anybody get it?
[93:49.64]It was a wolf.
[93:50.42]I don't think anybody got it.
[93:55.98]Yeah, but I do own it for VR.
[93:58.06]You'll see it at some point.
[94:06.15]Got some free filled-in ones.
[94:07.65]That's good.
[94:14.42]Which leads us, that's 2, okay.
[94:17.68]That's 5, 1.
[94:18.50]5, 2.
[94:18.54]2, 1, 1, 2.
[94:21.24]Alright, what can we work with now?
[94:29.04]Well, it has to be here.
[94:33.08]And then that has to be there.
[94:35.81]Good to know.
[94:37.11]That's also part of a 1.
[94:37.89]This is 3.
[94:40.59]That's a 1, 4, 1.
[94:48.49]3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[94:49.09]Not quite.
[94:50.29]Not quite.
[94:55.01]2, 2, 1.
[94:55.09]I don't know.
[94:56.71]I don't know any of these yet.
[94:58.69]That one's empty.
[95:05.04]Um...
[95:08.58]5, this is part of 5.
[95:09.58]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[95:10.16]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[95:10.63]Okay.
[95:12.15]3, that's part of the 4.
[95:15.09]That's part of the 2.
[95:16.27]That's part of the 3, I'm going to assume.
[95:23.19]No, no, music.
[95:23.99]Right, right, right.
[95:24.41]Sorry, sorry.
[95:24.88]My bad.
[95:33.00]I apologize already.
[95:41.03]Hey, you say you're getting tired of lettuce and tomato hamburgers in this town that don't quite make it?
[95:45.67]Yeah!
[95:46.53]You say that just once you'd like your hamburger hot and your lettuce and tomato cool and crisp all at the same time?
[95:52.61]Yeah!
[95:53.37]Well, I say you got it.
[95:55.23]I'm talking McDonald's new lettuce and tomato hamburger.
[95:57.49]The McDLT.
[95:59.87]I'm talking quarter pound of beef on the hot, hot side.
[96:02.37]And the hot stays hot.
[96:04.43]The new McDLT.
[96:06.11]Hot, hot.
[96:06.75]Less lettuce and tomato on the cool, cool side.
[96:09.15]And the cool.
[96:10.25]Stay cool, the new McDLT.
[96:12.29]The cool stays hot, the cool stays crisp.
[96:16.04]Put it together, you can't resist.
[96:17.92]The hottest taste, the coolest crunch.
[96:20.92]Hot, hot, keep it cool, cool.
[96:23.08]McDLT, McDLT, hot beefy McD, cool crisp LT.
[96:27.74]McDLT, it's a good time, hot beefy McD, with a great taste.
[96:33.67]At McDonald's!
[97:02.36]So I gotta mark the ones which there are a couple that I didn't do right This is the three because it's not one two three I
[97:22.17]So that's probably one, two, three, or one, two, three.
[97:24.67]Hmm!
[97:27.51]Can we go back to McDonald's?
[97:29.67]No.
[97:35.28]One, two, three, two, there it is.
[97:49.76]Hope you have a nice relaxing Friday afternoon.
[97:53.86]What's today's date?
[97:55.84]Friday night.
[97:58.74]I'm your master of ceremonies, jermaOn 8-5.
[98:06.81]Dylan Jacobs.
[98:09.29]Grew up in the southernmost port of Mississippi.

[98:25.92]Or it is, mom makes a really mean apple pie.
[98:30.94]Be in the studio shortly with us tonight.
[98:40.53]But first I gotta get done with this P-Cross level.
[98:54.19]Alright, where am I going?
[98:54.87]Here, here, here.
[98:57.61]P cross?
[98:58.11]It is P cross.
[99:00.47]It's P cross.
[99:03.71]Two, two, four, one, four.
[99:05.89]One, one, two, one, two.
[99:22.83]Three, two, one... What the hell is this?
[99:27.19]A flora?
[99:27.59]Alright, I'm gonna slow down, because I'm feeling him at a kind of insane pace.
[99:38.52]Let me do... There we go.
[99:41.08]Look at what an insane pace he's going at.
[99:44.07]Slowly, hover his head over and press that one.
[99:48.39]I'm going at an insane pace.
[99:53.83]What did you say before?
[99:54.55]Like Arby's grandma?
[99:55.51]Oh.
[100:04.50]I soft- I soft all the tenon- Is that eggs?
[100:11.19]How did you get daisies?
[100:12.51]Five, six of you got daisies right.
[100:14.19]Alright.
[100:18.47]Fifteen by fifteen.
[100:19.41]These are gonna take a while.
[100:25.90]13, 14, 15, therefore 2!
[100:26.56]No, I don't know that yet.
[100:34.48]Alright, 1.
[100:46.75]Let's just cover these up.
[100:51.21]That felt pretty good.
[100:52.21]This is empty now.
[100:54.89]What song am I playing?
[100:55.69]This is... Background chill-out music.
[100:59.28]Music for relaxed study, work, relaxing jazz music.
[101:03.08]There's a coffee cup on the counter.
[101:10.39]ResidentSleeper.
[101:11.21]Well, just relax.
[101:14.65]What have you got going on today?
[101:15.73]Do you have something to do?
[101:20.03]Somewhere to go?
[101:20.85]Or maybe if you've got nowhere to be at all.
[101:24.35]But if you are going out, skip it.
[101:26.87]Stay here.
[101:28.95]Watch a 33-year-old moron try to complete 80-year-old Arby's grandmother's puzzles.
[101:55.53]Olive Garden, not Arby's.
[101:56.71]Why do I keep saying Arby's?
[102:00.27]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[102:05.09]Reminds me of a story.
[102:14.18]I'm not going to tell a story.
[102:15.16]No.
[102:15.84]Don't.
[102:16.50]Who cares?
[102:28.82]there's lots of ones here there's your three there's your second three and there's no no no no no no no no no start off top six these are all six all of them nice
[102:55.82]Alright, what about the bottom here?
[102:56.74]We've got 5... 1... Where's this one?
[103:01.52]That row's done, okay.
[103:02.82]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9... That's full.
[103:05.36]That's full.
[103:05.66]Full!
[103:05.80]3... 1s... That's a 7.
[103:06.78]3, and then a 1.
[103:10.00]This is all full already.
[103:11.15]7.
[103:12.71]This is a computer!
[103:24.75]Some form of computer, guys.
[103:29.97]Okay.
[103:31.53]Number seven in here.
[103:34.35]That looks pretty done to me.
[103:37.35]And it does.
[103:41.63]Oh, it's a floppy!
[103:42.67]Floppy!
[103:47.63]Nice.
[103:52.97]This one's already done for me, I didn't even load a baby level!
[103:56.75]15x15, you sure it's not, like, 8x6?
[104:02.78]Why even have this as a 15x15 level?
[104:04.82]Alright, so, uh, we have six here.
[104:11.72]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[104:14.74]I mean, it can just be this whole fucking thing.
[104:19.59]Right in the middle there.
[104:27.19]Any more sixes?
[104:27.69]There are.
[104:31.63]Any more sixes?
[104:33.33]Or high numbers?
[104:35.03]What about one, two, three, four?
[104:38.33]Damn it!
[104:43.84]This stream is boring.
[104:44.78]Uh... Well...
[104:55.73]I'm sorry that you think that.
[104:57.16]But it is.
[105:01.14]This is not what I wanted to do tonight.
[105:03.18]I kind of got fucking screwed.
[105:06.10]My Dreamcast overheated and exploded.
[105:11.85]And I wasn't able to play the Dreamcast thing that I wanted to do.
[105:14.03]We're just relaxing.
[105:23.45]I'll probably call it here in like an hour.
[105:28.72]What am I doing tomorrow?
[105:30.20]Tomorrow, I think I'm healthy enough to do VR again.
[105:39.38]I'm pretty sure I'm good to go.
[105:43.29]The last couple of days, I really wanted to just not do it.
[105:47.47]I have like another four or five VR experiences I want to do.
[105:51.69]So expect Minecraft VR.
[105:55.11]Yes, it's going to happen.
[105:56.99]Minecraft VR is going to be tomorrow.
[105:59.49]And probably a handful of other things.
[106:03.07]And I can't fucking believe... And here's the worst part about that.
[106:05.68]That stream will probably have the highest view count of any stream I've done in the last year.
[106:11.88]Last time I played Minecraft for like an hour, my view count went up by like 1,000 to 2,000 people.
[106:20.00]I don't know why.
[106:21.52]But it's okay.
[106:22.98]It's all good.
[106:24.68]Over 10,000?
[106:25.18]No, I don't think so.
[106:28.78]I would be surprised if that stream had that many.
[106:30.94]No way.
[106:36.41]But that's what we're going to do tomorrow.
[106:38.31]I'm definitely healthy enough again to do it.
[106:41.23]But for now, we're just chilling out.
[106:45.25]Just playing this little Picross game.
[106:49.03]We're dialing it back a little.
[106:53.61]And we'll get back to it tomorrow.
[106:56.15]If you've got somewhere to be, if you've got somewhere to go, or if you think it's boring, then we'll see you tomorrow.
[107:01.13]You know, it's okay.
[107:03.17]Not every stream has to be fucking crazy, you know?
[107:06.17]Sometimes you just paint a picture and do it very slowly because you're bad.
[107:15.21]But with that being said, let's go.
[107:17.24]Let's just keep playing.
[107:23.70]What happened to the music?
[107:29.52]He's picking out all the one negative comments.
[107:31.96]Yeah, but I want to be... Let's be real about it.
[107:35.79]I'm playing Picross.
[107:39.11]When I told everybody, like, Space Channel 5 tonight, guys.
[107:42.47]Space Channel 5.
[107:43.13]You ready?
[107:43.49]Oh, yeah.
[107:43.95]Choo-choo.
[107:44.55]Can't wait.
[107:49.41]Well, it makes sense.
[107:50.63]So this is one.
[107:52.46]One in space.
[107:53.12]One.
[107:53.26]Yeah.
[108:02.45]Is it the two?
[108:04.75]Also one, also one.
[108:06.21]Hmm.
[108:16.79]But yeah.
[108:18.05]VR will be tomorrow.
[108:22.83]Hmm.
[108:30.86]3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[108:32.86]It's not enough.
[108:35.18]Is there a Jerma Discord?
[108:36.18]There is.
[108:37.90]It's open to the public.
[108:40.00]There are a couple of sub-only... Well, there's only one sub-only room, actually.
[108:43.06]Yeah, I can't make it tomorrow.
[108:53.18]Will you cancel it?
[108:54.49]No.
[108:57.03]It's not gonna be a long stream.
[108:58.26]All my VR streams are less than four or five hours.
[109:04.44]So it's okay, you can catch it.
[109:07.78]It's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[109:10.32]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[109:18.07]Now we got some info.
[109:26.15]No.
[109:26.92]Okay, this is part of the three, then.
[109:32.66]Three.
[109:34.70]Which way?
[109:37.94]Well, it's definitely not here.
[109:41.11]One, two, three, four, five.
[109:43.17]One, two, three, four, five.
[109:44.63]No.
[109:47.21]Take the stream again tomorrow, another day.
[109:51.09]Just put aside five hours.
[109:53.15]Yeah, I can't expect anybody to make every stream.
[110:01.36]What kind of psycho would I have to be to assume that everybody is going to be at the stream?
[110:07.85]For five, four, five, six, seven plus hours.
[110:13.93]You know, people have shit to do.
[110:16.11]You know, some people got places to be, things to do.
[110:21.33]That's a lot of, that's a commitment to sit here for, you know, eight hours.
[110:25.77]Some of you, like a lot of you guys stick around for a long time.
[110:35.97]So this is the one, then.
[110:39.89]However long you stay, that's... I'm fucking happy you came.
[110:52.34]Okay, two.
[110:53.70]There's three.

[111:20.12]One, two.
[111:22.62]No, I just, I don't know that info yet.
[111:28.66]We're bots, we're not actually here.
[111:30.38]Oh, yeah?

[112:05.00]We're special bots.
[112:05.96]We get our own IPS.
[112:11.96]Are you pulling my leg here?
[112:13.08]I think you might be.
[112:16.08]God.
[112:16.50]Some of you guys just tell tall tales.
[112:24.62]One, two, there's four.
[112:25.66]So one, two, three, four.

[115:28.56]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[115:32.74]No, this is the one that was given.
[115:33.84]So this has to be here.
[115:36.78]Let me just keep troubleshooting this.
[115:50.43]Because that's done.
[115:52.65]This is done.
[116:05.92]Alright, let me see here.
[116:06.80]Fuck.

[117:42.57]Here?
[117:44.59]It's done.
[117:45.21]It's so close, which is incorrect.
[117:47.11]Here?
[117:47.39]Fuck.
[117:52.18]One, two, one.
[118:04.45]No, this is not right.
[118:05.61]Oh, what is that?
[118:27.46]One thing.
[118:28.33]I'm not seeing one thing.
[119:05.30]I screwed it up.
[119:06.24]I can't.
[119:07.24]You do it.
[119:07.76]You guys do it.
[119:08.74]You guys do it.
[119:09.60]You do it.
[119:10.88]You do it.

[119:16.63]Just do it.
[119:17.13]Somebody do it.
[119:18.41]Somebody do it.
[119:18.97]I'm going to close all these out.
[119:20.07]Somebody do it.
[119:24.29]You're not going to fill A. No, no.
[119:25.77]Somebody do it.
[119:26.75]Somebody get it.
[119:27.97]Somebody do it.
[119:30.34]Ugh.

[119:50.86]Fill in G4.
[119:51.64]Okay.
[119:51.78]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[119:52.84]I'm not picking that one.
[119:55.64]G5?
[120:04.29]L4.
[120:05.61]Okay, looking good so far.
[120:09.00]You guys are fucking bailing me out here.
[120:10.82]Thank you.
[120:14.92]Remove L4.
[120:15.90]It's gone.
[120:21.40]It's working.
[120:22.25]It's working.
[120:24.89]And then fill in L6.
[120:26.65]Oh, thank goodness, you guys.
[120:27.97]Thank you.
[120:28.97]I'm so... Uh...
[120:35.90]Well, congratulations, whoever guessed snail.
[120:38.22]I'm telling you, it's music.
[120:47.61]You guys wonder, why does he not have a playlist on?
[120:49.51]I can't, I can't focus with anything going on.
[120:56.85]Why does he not listen to music?
[120:58.43]I can't.
[121:00.15]Unless I'm, like, locked in a room.
[121:05.74]This is 1, 2, 3, any zeros?
[121:06.56]Let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[121:07.38]No, that's not quite correct.
[121:15.03]Alright, this is music!
[121:16.17]Okay, so...
[121:36.76]1, 2, 3.
[121:37.04]1, 2, 3.
[121:37.14]The rest of this is garbage.
[121:41.50]Get rid of it.
[121:47.99]Can you put on my mixtape?
[121:50.81]Maybe.
[121:51.61]Depends on what it is.
[121:53.61]This is 1, 1, 2.
[121:54.49]Let's see.
[121:55.03]So we got 2, 1, 1, 1.
[121:55.47]2, 1, 1, 1.
[121:56.33]1, 2.
[122:05.95]Put on the rats mixtape.
[122:10.37]Well, there's five.
[122:11.69]Let's see.
[122:12.58]One, two, three, four, five, one.
[122:15.06]Okay, so bye-bye to all this.
[122:19.82]What the hell else do we have here?
[122:21.52]Three.
[122:24.02]Gotta be here.
[122:24.66]There's your seven.
[122:27.61]Ladies and gentlemen.
[122:30.27]One.
[122:30.89]Lots of ones.
[122:33.48]Let's refill this rest of it in.
[122:36.10]This is gone now, too.
[122:38.04]So is this, and so is this.
[122:41.00]Finish that one up.
[122:42.04]Cover that here.
[122:45.87]What happened to Jerma's audio software stream?
[122:48.79]Yeah.
[122:49.79]I know.
[122:51.75]Too many ideas.
[122:52.37]They're all gonna happen.
[122:57.81]Did you see the Jerma is a liar video?
[123:01.34]I did.
[123:09.80]Play it again.
[123:10.68]One.
[123:18.71]One.
[123:18.85]This is another one.
[123:23.31]Two, one.
[123:23.77]This is filled in.
[123:27.09]What is this music?
[123:27.99]Is this a boomerang?
[123:35.22]One, two, three, four, five.
[123:43.81]Two, cool.
[123:46.15]That's the rest of the 11.
[123:52.77]One, one, one, three.
[124:00.43]That is a three here too.
[124:02.23]One, two, three, one, two, three.
[124:10.46]We got four, and then a one.
[124:12.50]We got three.
[124:16.26]Where's that four at?
[124:17.48]Right there.
[124:19.34]And then right here.
[124:20.52]What is it?
[124:20.98]Comb?
[124:21.30]Oh, music, right.
[124:27.08]It's a pan flute.
[124:29.64]Hey, nice job, guys.
[124:37.33]Hey, Jerma, thanks for these streams.
[124:38.47]I can get through horror games more easily.
[124:42.08]Yeah.
[124:42.60]Hell yeah.
[124:44.97]Don't get too scared.
[124:46.19]Remember, it's not real.
[125:07.98]Okay, got seven... This is four... Seven.
[125:16.44]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[125:18.90]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[125:22.16]Can't do anything else.
[125:26.85]This is gonna be hard.
[125:27.39]I really appreciate these quiet streams since I can be the one guy more often.
[125:32.39]Yeah.
[125:37.73]Don't worry.
[125:38.07]Tomorrow is very, very... It's reared up to be really loud.
[125:43.21]Intense.
[125:45.55]There'll be a loud one tomorrow.
[125:47.53]You'll see.
[125:54.28]So, one.
[125:55.32]Let's go with... One, two, three, four, five.
[125:59.98]One, two, three, four, five.
[126:01.68]So...
[126:05.41]Now we can figure this out.
[126:08.12]Right?
[126:09.74]Because it can't be up there.
[126:10.72]So it's going to be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[126:11.48]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[126:11.64]1, 2, 3, 4, space, 2.
[126:11.98]I got it.
[126:12.18]No, I don't.
[126:12.56]I don't know.
[126:14.08]That's wrong.
[126:34.15]Uh, what can I do with this?
[126:36.41]Seven.
[126:37.31]Two.
[126:41.83]Well, there's a four here somewhere, but I don't know where because I don't have any more blocks.
[126:48.56]None of these can be figured out.
[126:49.82]There's too little of them.
[126:53.52]Dermabait.
[126:57.03]I'm making you mental by not using the middle mouse button.
[127:00.89]Yeah, I know.
[127:03.58]It's just different play styles, you know?
[127:24.67]Two, three, four, one, two, so that has to be there.
[127:27.13]Here's the five.
[127:34.19]Five can only be done, yeah?
[127:36.15]Yep.
[127:38.83]Now that unlocks this.
[127:42.51]Which in turn lets us determine that you got one, two, three, four.
[127:47.88]You also can do one, two, three, four.
[127:50.02]Therefore... What about this one?
[127:55.90]Three.
[127:56.56]You can do one, two, three.
[127:58.22]One, two, three, therefore.
[128:01.26]Closing in on this one, let's see.
[128:11.25]still trying to this is four two it's just which way does this because if this is here right say that's one two three four then it has to be either here no no but if it's here then it has to be here so I don't have enough info
[128:43.11]Dermot wants to play RuneScape?
[128:49.03]I mean, I... I've never played it.
[128:52.53]I can do something with this, knowing that the 6 is down here, though.
[129:00.34]Let's see.
[129:02.78]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...
[129:09.33]So knowing that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[129:10.75]Alright.
[129:11.17]What does that lead us?
[129:12.43]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[129:13.41]OK.
[129:13.53]So then that gives a few.
[129:15.05]1, 2, 3.
[129:17.51]1, 2, 3.
[129:17.57]Bingo.
[129:39.72]And all you gotta do is unlock one.
[129:44.54]And the whole thing starts to complete itself.
[129:54.23]Now this can go down.
[129:56.35]Alright, let's go.
[129:56.83]1, 2, 3, 4.
[129:57.15]Or 1, 2, 3, 4.
[129:57.59]So.
[129:57.81]Not enough info.
[129:59.35]Yes, there is.
[130:10.28]Because of that new line I just made.
[130:11.40]Oh, that's some good cider, yeah?
[130:15.97]I wish I had a cider right now.
[130:17.75]I'd just be hanging out.
[130:19.23]Sipping it.
[130:23.07]So, let's see.
[130:23.51]That's done.
[130:24.23]One, two, three.
[130:27.68]No way to know that.
[130:30.74]Well, there's no way it's there.
[130:33.32]So, one, two, three.
[130:34.82]One, two, three.
[130:35.28]Not enough info.
[130:35.80]Oh.
[130:41.47]I mean, it really wants to be right here, doesn't it?
[130:44.23]Hmm.
[130:53.19]1, 2, 3, 5.
[130:53.39]2.
[130:53.45]And this is 1, 1, 2, 3.
[130:53.93]Cross that.
[131:12.89]Okay.
[131:16.47]It's too much info on the screen for me.
[131:17.99]Even though it's more desirable, I know.
[131:19.91]What is this?
[131:34.98]Accessory?
[131:38.96]What kind of accessory is this?
[131:43.37]So it's not here.
[131:45.25]It's none of these.
[131:45.89]It's not this one either.
[131:48.85]Good to know.
[131:54.78]It's Shito!
[131:59.92]It is Shito.
[132:00.66]I wonder if it's gonna be yellow.
[132:17.84]Shito.
[132:18.32]No, it is a pipe.
[132:22.03]Did we already do this one?
[132:22.91]I feel like we did that one already last time.
[132:28.05]Maybe not.
[132:30.79]Hold on, let me take a look.
[132:34.58]Yeah, we did do that one last time.
[132:36.38]I was wondering.
[132:37.16]See, look, we did it.
[132:37.86]Remember, mustache, watermelon.
[132:41.62]This is where we left off.
[132:45.10]This is tools.
[132:46.54]Also 15x15.
[132:50.93]This one looks interesting.
[132:51.69]13, 14.
[132:54.55]5, 8, 15.
[132:54.69]So we can do this row.
[133:10.33]So it's a tool.
[133:14.51]And there are no zeros this time.
[133:15.75]No.
[133:16.71]No help this time.
[133:22.48]13.
[133:22.52]Can do that.
[133:24.41]Alright.
[133:28.61]Any more that I guarantee?
[133:29.69]Let's see.
[133:29.89]That's 3, 6, 12, 13, 14.
[133:30.27]No.
[133:30.35]7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[133:30.47]8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[133:30.71]5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[133:52.97]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[133:56.63]Not quite.
[133:57.24]I need to get something else here.
[133:58.24]Some more data.
[134:01.48]But let's cancel this stuff out over here.
[134:08.20]So all these down here.
[134:09.28]Uh-huh.
[134:17.09]Okay.
[134:18.45]Again, same thing with this one.
[134:25.05]Any more.
[134:25.49]That's a 1.
[134:25.77]That's a 1.
[134:26.23]That's a 7.
[134:26.47]That's a... I can do this one now, can't I?
[134:29.49]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[134:29.95]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[134:30.45]1, 2, 3, 4.
[134:30.53]Nah, I can't.
[134:31.01]Guys got some pretty good guesses so far.
[134:55.10]Who knows?
[134:59.84]Alright.
[135:01.83]7, 1, 1.
[135:05.69]Well, it has to be this way.
[135:07.05]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[135:07.95]There it is.
[135:12.39]Maybe give us some more info.
[135:17.32]There's two.
[135:17.86]Cross this whole thing out.
[135:24.49]4, 3, it's gotta be here, right?
[135:29.39]Yeah, because 1, 2, 3, and then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[135:32.63]Yeah, that's it.
[135:35.01]Is that done?
[135:36.57]Whole row gone?
[135:43.57]3, 13, close it.
[135:44.66]14, close it.
[135:45.62]Close it.
[135:47.76]Nice.
[135:48.56]There's the 5.
[135:54.04]This is a really weird looking tool.
[136:00.30]Somebody said umbrella.
[136:02.52]This actually could be an umbrella, maybe.
[136:04.42]A fairly busted umbrella.
[136:35.56]Let's not do that yet.
[136:45.26]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[136:49.74]There we go.
[136:58.77]Four somewhere.
[136:59.71]One, two, three, four.
[137:05.11]one yep alright what are that any more info what the hell is this tool it looks like a wine opener well this is seven
[137:38.01]1, 4, right?
[137:40.49]I mean, it has to be.
[137:41.59]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[137:44.00]Don't know.
[137:44.26]Could be anything.
[137:44.72]5, 4, 1, 1.
[137:44.86]There's your 1.
[137:45.38]3, 1.
[137:45.44]That's done.
[137:45.84]Do I have this incorrect?
[137:47.34]This looks completely wrong.
[138:10.71]Doesn't this look completely incorrect?
[138:19.49]Two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[138:30.32]Two, one is the two.
[138:31.86]Alright, almost done.
[138:49.41]Four somewhere in here.
[138:52.37]Three.
[138:53.09]The one is there.
[138:54.15]This is a two.
[138:56.21]This is the end of that.
[139:09.37]Eight.
[139:10.58]Done.
[139:12.30]Three.
[139:14.64]So now I have to consider...
[139:18.81]Where the 6 is, because that's 3... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[139:22.71]Space 1, 2, 3.
[139:25.11]No, not quite.
[139:36.52]That's done.
[139:37.88]That makes things a little easier.
[139:40.52]Because then... Yeah.
[139:43.40]Cool.
[139:43.50]Cool.
[139:49.35]Is this... Is it a hammer?
[139:53.15]That's clearly a hammer.
[139:58.72]Wait, hold on.
[140:07.28]Yeah.
[140:07.88]It's somebody holding a hammer.
[140:14.50]Well.
[140:17.06]Nice job.
[140:19.81]Got another easy one here.
[140:21.61]What time is it?
[140:22.09]It's been about five hours.
[140:23.47]I'll keep going.
[140:25.97]I'm good to go.
[140:27.33]For like a little while.
[140:36.28]I think this is done already.
[140:37.36]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, it is.
[140:39.04]Play some music?
[140:48.46]I got her on right now.
[140:51.72]I like this.
[140:52.08]This is very, very... It sits in the background.
[140:55.64]It's not causing any problems.
[140:59.70]My two halves can sit together.
[141:04.85]I like this for now.
[141:08.95]Yeah, it's pretty good coffee shop music.
[141:10.35]This is really good weather channel music.
[141:14.05]You know, while you sit there and watch to see if your school got cancelled.
[141:21.05]Alright, where are we?
[141:24.31]One.
[141:25.01]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, nope.
[141:29.11]But I can do this.
[141:30.10]Because, I mean, if it's here, let's just do that.
[141:36.04]Because then it has to be space.
[141:38.02]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[141:41.10]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[141:45.31]Okay.
[141:49.23]Dude, school got canceled?
[141:50.29]Are you serious?
[141:50.85]I used to love that.
[141:53.79]It was the best thing ever.
[141:56.64]Nothing could compare to when you got up on a snow-filled day, looked out the window, saw that there was a shitload of snow outside, and you're like, there's no way I'm going to school.
[142:09.56]Somebody tells you, no school, and you go, I cannot wait.
[142:13.11]That's perfect.
[142:14.31]Go outside for like 40 minutes.
[142:17.42]Come back in and play Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Turtles in Time.
[142:21.55]All day.
[142:25.81]What a day.
[142:26.15]Alright, that's 0, 0.
[142:28.77]This is also part of 7.
[142:35.74]Wait a minute, hold on.
[142:37.02]Can I just do this now?
[142:38.86]No, not yet.
[142:47.31]This is the end of the four.
[142:49.71]So let's just say one, two, three, four, right?
[142:55.44]One, two, three, four.
[143:03.10]Okay.
[143:06.64]Those days were awesome, but I'll never forget that day.
[143:08.14]We were, uh, the only school in the Valley that didn't have their school closed for weather.
[143:16.71]Yeah, that sucked.
[143:22.89]When you were certain that school was going to get cancelled and then no, it did not and you had to go to school.
[143:26.25]Or like a two hour delay.
[143:28.13]A one hour delay.
[143:29.70]That was worse than just going to school.
[143:33.44]Because then that sinking feeling in your gut.
[143:36.92]Oh, there's a foot of snow on the ground!
[143:39.50]One hour delay.
[143:41.88]Oh... Oh...
[143:51.28]I would rather them add an hour to the top of school than let me come in an hour late on a school day.
[143:57.23]On a snow day.
[144:01.49]That sucks.
[144:04.33]Alright, let's focus here.
[144:05.06]So this is the two.
[144:12.42]I don't know if this is the one or the three.
[144:14.08]This is part of the seven.
[144:15.42]So let's see.
[144:15.88]I closed that down a little.
[144:17.12]This could be the one.
[144:18.84]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[144:21.02]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[144:22.90]Not much more info I can go on there, though.
[144:28.16]This is the one.
[144:30.50]Unless, let's see.
[144:30.98]Hold on.
[144:32.94]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[144:34.96]No.
[144:37.25]There's no way to tell.
[144:38.19]Not yet.
[144:45.42]two, one, one, seven, two, one.
[144:51.51]So let's say one, one, seven, then one could be down here, which means one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[145:09.24]Awesome.
[145:13.79]Does that do anything for me?
[145:15.85]I don't think it does.
[145:18.61]Unless this is a 1.
[145:19.69]No, it is.
[145:20.49]So this is going to help here.
[145:27.60]Whenever we had a delay, my mom just called in to say it was too icy where we lived.
[145:32.80]That's a 300 IQ mom play right there.
[145:39.90]Alright, so let's just say that this is the 4 here.
[145:42.31]So let's say...
[145:44.74]That's just a 1.
[145:45.52]1, 2, 3, 4.
[145:47.04]1, 2, 3, 4.
[145:47.68]Alright, nice.
[145:54.94]It's clearly the 4.
[146:00.72]What, a 75 IQ kid?
[146:02.43]How do you know that?
[146:05.91]You don't have that information.
[146:07.07]What do you mean?
[146:08.65]Was that you?
[146:09.71]Wait, who did you run- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[146:14.81]Did I just read?
[146:15.59]Maybe they're best friends.
[146:27.91]No, no, how would you know that if it wasn't?
[146:31.81]Somebody find that.
[146:35.23]They're friends, oh.
[146:39.37]You're right, you're right, that could be possible.
[146:58.71]How did you not figure that out?
[147:02.03]I don't know, because who knows?
[147:05.35]This is the three here.
[147:07.07]I figured that out, so I was the three.
[147:17.28]Alright, this is an animal.
[147:20.30]We're all friends.
[147:20.84]We all have the same IQ.
[147:34.03]I'm gonna assume these two are both filled in.
[147:37.45]In that case, then it would be... Hold on.
[147:48.30]This is five.
[147:51.04]So one, two, three, five.
[147:53.19]So close up this shit.
[147:57.91]So then same thing with this.
[148:00.85]Get rid of this nonsense.
[148:06.31]Which, in turn... Can move those out of the way now.
[148:18.24]Fuck.
[148:27.16]There's another one over here.
[148:28.62]Let's just say it's right there.
[148:34.32]Combine our IQs together.
[148:37.38]Me dumber since I started watching.
[148:43.26]You're probably smarter.
[148:44.72]You just feel dumber.
[148:45.72]Alright, I think that helps here.
[148:58.13]There it is.
[149:04.02]Yes.
[149:05.04]Progress has been made.
[149:10.55]I did it.
[149:11.19]I clicked one.
[149:21.74]Actually might be a rat.
[149:24.78]So then the three is over here somewhere.
[149:54.16]Wait, if that's down there... Yeah, that's the only place that can be.
[149:58.38]I mean, it could be here.
[150:01.26]But then that would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[150:03.02]No, I don't know.
[150:05.90]I can't tell if that's down there or not.
[150:24.54]Fuck.
[150:30.02]Well, this is obviously a two has to be back here, so it's not this.
[150:33.51]Oh, okay.
[150:34.09]I just helped myself there.
[150:37.87]That helps.
[150:39.27]How much does that give me?
[150:45.93]Enough.
[150:50.74]Oh, perfect.
[150:51.22]Okay, cool.
[150:52.98]So this is seven now.
[150:54.06]Fill that in.
[150:55.35]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[150:58.43]One is somewhere over there.
[151:00.81]Ten is filled in.
[151:02.01]There you go.
[151:06.74]Five could be anywhere right now.
[151:22.91]Seven start one two three Well, I just threw that one completely under the bus for everybody that thought this was a rat It is absolutely not a rat it's very it's a rat with a tall head Looks incorrect
[152:01.45]No, I can stay.
[152:07.95]So.
[152:10.82]Hey, look.
[152:11.88]Perfect opportunity for a 1.
[152:15.52]What the hell is this?
[152:19.30]Is this a bird?
[152:38.48]I have no idea.
[152:48.84]Well, let's just say... What the hell is that?
[152:53.74]4 is somewhere here.
[152:56.38]I need to figure this out.
[153:04.63]Could be here, though.
[153:05.71]It could...
[153:19.31]What?
[153:26.91]Why is this down here?
[153:29.95]It shouldn't have a detached leg.
[153:43.60]Is this poo?
[153:44.56]It's not poo.
[153:49.21]four three this can be filled in no it can't I think it has this one of these has to be here because if let's just say it's if you got one two three four get a space which leads to one two three or one two yeah it has to be there I think
[154:19.72]I'm not certain, though.
[154:20.53]I'm gonna keep that there.
[154:26.83]Fuck.
[154:28.73]That's not right.
[154:42.62]What animal is this?
[154:46.93]Yeah, I had it right.
[155:00.66]I am stumped.
[155:01.40]I don't know what this remotely could be.
[155:05.42]Is this the head over here?
[155:06.28]Or is this the head here?
[155:07.68]Or is the head down here?
[155:08.48]Is it like curled up?
[155:13.37]No.
[155:14.07]There's the two.
[155:18.43]Okay.
[155:20.67]Still haven't figured that part out though.
[155:31.03]It's done.
[155:31.87]Alright.
[155:33.35]Um... Is it a rooster, probably?
[155:46.33]Kangaroo?
[155:47.13]Maybe.
[155:47.43]This one's tricky, though, because I can't... I just kind of need to...
[156:07.97]What is it?
[156:11.51]It's a seagull!
[156:15.63]Wow!
[156:20.29]Four people got that.
[156:21.66]Nice job.
[156:33.02]Stream has been saved.
[156:40.93]12, 13, 14, 15.
[156:41.01]12, 13, 14, 15.
[156:41.17]Let's see.
[156:41.43]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[156:41.79]Okay.
[156:41.89]Same thing here.
[156:42.45]11.
[156:42.47]11!
[156:42.49]12, 13, 14, 15.
[157:16.42]Nobody saw that.
[157:20.72]Zero IQ.
[157:23.00]Nobody saw that.
[157:23.73]That's 11.
[157:31.59]So this is 12 down.
[157:32.81]That's 8, 9, 10, 11.
[157:34.07]He's got a fucking beef brain.
[157:43.88]Well, that's the one.
[157:44.50]Sure.
[157:44.94]Sure.
[157:46.29]Let's continue down.
[157:48.75]6, 3, 7.
[157:49.49]Any more that I can do?
[157:50.93]5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[157:52.26]It's not 12.
[157:52.56]So close.
[157:52.82]This is a toy.
[157:53.44]1, 2, 3.
[157:53.50]Go like this.
[158:14.55]Let's see how much we can get here.
[158:15.89]That's one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, five.
[158:19.69]Okay.
[158:24.34]Anything else?
[158:24.92]That's the one.
[158:25.66]Nope.
[158:26.46]No more info there.
[158:27.84]Six.
[158:28.44]We can do some of this.
[158:34.02]Three.
[158:35.00]Again, we can go like this.
[158:38.55]Two is even better.
[158:44.83]uh seven one two three four five six seven okay let's get to work that could be two one
[159:16.55]Uh, refor is wrong?
[159:18.75]What do you mean?
[159:23.44]I have thought of... I, for some reason, thought it was the only... Yeah, I'm stupid.
[159:28.89]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[159:30.19]That's true, that's true, that's true.
[159:31.01]Because, look, there has to be a 2 in here.
[159:34.97]Yeah, no, that's correct.
[159:36.11]I had it right.
[159:37.27]Just not this one.
[159:46.88]The 8 and the 2?
[159:47.48]What do you mean?
[159:50.68]Other Xs.
[159:51.86]This is row 4.
[159:55.20]This is the 1 here.
[159:59.97]I mean, I guess technically you're right.
[160:03.39]This could be the 3, right?
[160:05.75]Technically, you could be right.
[160:11.00]I'll leave it.
[160:19.05]Alright, let's get started.
[160:23.42]No 2 there.
[160:23.98]5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 3, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[160:26.90]No.
[160:26.96]1, 2, 3, 4.
[160:27.08]We have 4s to work with.
[160:28.32]There's the 2.
[160:51.48]There's a 2 in here somewhere.
[160:53.12]There's the 11.
[160:53.68]Okay.
[161:03.69]2 and then 2.
[161:05.49]I'll take a look at that.
[161:07.07]Found that 2.
[161:10.33]And then 7.
[161:11.53]Nice.
[161:13.86]Which then leads us to 2.
[161:14.88]Cover, cover, cover, cover.
[161:19.61]Now, this is great, because look at this.
[161:22.41]Say goodbye to everything up here, everything up here, everything up here.
[161:25.63]Not quite up here.
[161:26.49]Look at this row.
[161:36.34]This game does not... I don't think this game has an OST.
[161:38.36]I'm pretty sure it doesn't.
[161:41.10]It just has one song that plays over and over again.
[161:43.83]Alright.
[161:49.46]So, this is definitely one, two.
[161:52.89]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[161:56.49]This is part of the three.
[162:01.37]Five, one.
[162:04.03]One, two, no, I can do this now.
[162:06.13]Five, two, two.
[162:12.11]That's three, sick, nice.
[162:18.20]three four gone this could go either way for a little while those are two so then one two three gotta be right in the middle there and it has to be right there thank you eight you gotta connect these fill in the three
[162:53.84]Where does that lead?
[162:56.90]That's two.
[162:59.26]One, two, three.
[163:00.17]One, two, three.
[163:04.51]I wish I had this one earlier.
[163:10.03]Six.
[163:10.97]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[163:16.38]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[163:20.80]That leads to one, two, three, four, five.
[163:25.71]Is this a toy?
[163:26.43]I know what this is.
[163:34.96]Alright, this should be fairly self-explanatory now.
[163:44.68]And then the four.
[163:47.41]And then the eight.
[163:49.99]Rubber Ducky!
[163:52.41]Congratulations to those of you that guessed it correct.
[163:57.50]One, two, three, four, five.
[163:58.74]A lot of you guys said boat.
[164:02.46]Meh.
[164:03.34]Looked a lot like a boat when we first started it.
[164:06.28]Bath duck.
[164:09.51]Nobody says bath duck.
[164:16.63]Bath duck sounds like a Russian translation.
[164:21.05]It's bath duck.
[164:26.13]Let's see.
[164:29.98]This is 15 by 15, but it's actually not.
[164:40.09]14 across, not quite what we're looking for.
[164:46.93]Got to find a good one here.
[164:50.49]I can still do it though.
[164:51.43]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[164:55.37]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[164:58.17]So let's just assume that this is in the middle.
[165:03.27]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[165:05.17]I can do these.
[165:10.66]And then over here, one, two, three, four, five, six.
[165:16.06]So that's one, two, three, four, five, six.
[165:19.22]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[165:21.54]I can get that done at least.
[165:34.56]Is that far enough?
[165:36.22]It is.
[165:40.24]There's our six.
[165:45.93]This is a food.
[165:47.91]Food.
[165:49.85]Knowing that...
[165:56.37]That's all I know at the moment.
[165:58.73]Except this could be the... This might be the 2 or the 4.
[166:01.89]Could it be the 4?
[166:03.89]1, 2, 3, 4.
[166:04.87]Space.
[166:06.33]No.
[166:10.87]No, the 4.
[166:11.27]This has to be the 4.
[166:21.79]Which leads... That's 7... 5, 2, 2...
[166:29.19]Let's see... Three, two... Well, let's do this.
[166:44.12]Let's narrow it down, because I can do some of this.
[166:46.40]One, two, three, four...
[166:55.08]Wish I had something over here.
[166:55.94]7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[166:56.38]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[167:01.36]Can at least get it kind of narrowed.
[167:09.41]This is the janitor game from yesterday.
[167:11.21]I think this is a little more involved than the janitor game, I will say.
[167:19.21]Shit.
[167:30.80]I got this one, yeah.
[167:40.50]Yeah, no 5.
[167:42.38]This is 5, 4, so 5 has to be here.
[167:46.38]So do I have enough?
[167:47.26]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[167:48.10]1, 2, 3, 4.
[167:50.26]Nope.
[167:50.64]That's enough info to get the middle, though.
[167:57.21]Because let's, again, let's assume that it looks like this.
[168:04.54]You just go like that and then go like this, right?
[168:07.56]One, two, three, four.
[168:08.56]One, two, three, four.
[168:09.78]One, two, three, four, five.
[168:12.42]One, two, three.
[168:13.08]I mean, I'm just going to assume this.
[168:20.53]Now this is interesting because this makes this the one.
[168:22.99]Same thing over here, right?
[168:26.11]No.
[168:27.15]This makes this the three.
[168:35.72]If that's the case... That would make this the six.
[168:42.32]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[168:44.18]Yeah, it would make this the six.
[168:45.34]So this is a two.
[168:59.64]Let's see... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... Which... There's an outside source of music.
[169:20.33]It's not from the game itself.
[169:27.34]Why is everybody doing the oh my god face?
[169:33.23]I'm seeing a lot of oh-my-oh-no face.
[169:36.17]Why?
[169:36.37]What's happening?
[169:37.11]What's wrong?
[169:44.21]Whoa, that like blinked.
[169:50.91]This has to be five in a row.
[169:52.23]I'm narrowing this down.
[169:57.07]Can I even get one here?
[170:02.30]Nice.
[170:02.52]Okay.
[170:02.74]At least I can get that.
[170:04.91]So these are all 2, 2, 2.
[170:08.09]Again, we got, it could be here, here, here, here.
[170:10.33]That means that this is empty.
[170:14.73]Right?
[170:15.05]Has to be.
[170:16.57]At least.
[170:16.89]So then this is 2, 4.
[170:25.79]2, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[170:28.15]Still possible.
[170:34.24]Can we leave the border's bookstore, Dad?
[170:37.40]No, I can do this shit for free.
[170:40.66]I just have to pretend I'm reading books and pretend I'm browsing.
[171:03.99]One, two, three, four, five.
[171:06.58]One, two, three, four, five.
[171:12.94]Ooh, I think we got it.
[171:13.94]That's how you narrow it down.
[171:17.76]Yes.
[171:28.05]Okay.
[171:32.67]So then now we got two.
[171:35.41]Still got nothing over here.
[171:48.55]Let me just get this out of the way because this is two now.
[171:52.68]So it has to be here or here.
[171:54.72]That one is not correct there.
[171:56.32]One, two, one.
[172:02.56]Again, that can be closed.
[172:07.08]There's your two right there.
[172:09.56]But is it... I know that's correct.
[172:16.13]But is this also a two here?
[172:18.15]Yeah.
[172:20.17]Uh... Yeah.
[172:35.61]Alright, slow it down here.
[172:36.55]That's one, two... Fuck.
[172:40.41]One, two, three, four.
[172:41.75]Fuck!
[172:50.42]No!
[172:53.04]What did I do wrong here?
[172:53.80]What did I assume there?
[172:58.56]Because that's one, two, three... This was here the whole time.
[173:02.04]This is new here.
[173:05.32]The one and the three, but that... Where did this go wrong?
[173:16.73]I don't want to reset this.
[173:17.53]I feel like just one block is wrong.
[173:20.23]Three, two.
[173:32.38]Move this.
[173:32.86]Hold on.
[173:33.74]One...
[173:41.01]No, this row is wrong.
[173:44.37]Something's fucked up here.
[173:48.03]Because two and then five.
[173:49.59]How did this come up?
[173:51.69]This is the correct part.
[174:08.80]Yeah, this is fucked up.
[174:13.35]I'm going to have to restart it.
[174:14.86]Oh, that's the worst part when you play Picross and you jumble up one thing and then you can't, your brain has already done it so you try to go back and you're like, fuck, what did I do wrong?
[174:54.69]3, 2... 2, 4... No!
[175:03.09]But that's not right!
[175:04.81]What's so wrong here?
[175:09.53]You know what I mean?
[175:10.11]Like, this is so wrong.
[175:11.79]Something fucked up in here.
[175:14.67]Either this is wrong, or this is wrong.
[175:18.11]E and F7.
[175:18.49]E7, F7.
[175:27.12]Something like right here is just bogus.
[175:37.16]I could just work around it.
[175:38.42]Yeah, that's true.
[175:39.00]I could just work around it.
[175:42.40]So now... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[175:49.04]This is... The only possibility is this.
[175:53.69]It can't be anything else.
[175:58.55]Then if that's the case... Let me remove this.
[176:04.71]So there's two here.
[176:06.11]There's two again.
[176:07.53]Two.
[176:10.99]There's the two.
[176:13.17]Cover that.
[176:14.73]There's your three.
[176:15.43]There's your two.
[176:16.97]There's your four.
[176:19.27]I think I fixed it.
[176:22.13]Yeah, I think I got it.
[176:23.23]Yep.
[176:25.45]And there's the five.
[176:26.13]Perfect.
[176:26.49]Okay, thank god.
[176:32.17]There it is.
[176:32.59]Okay, nice.
[176:41.62]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[176:43.52]It's wrong again.
[176:49.82]What happened here?
[176:55.51]Because two and then four.
[177:05.82]Alright.
[177:06.74]Is everything else intact still?
[177:14.47]I think so.
[177:15.13]Everything's intact.
[177:29.08]Guess ResidentSleeper.
[177:30.48]That's not what it is.
[177:32.49]I'm going to try again.
[177:43.68]Well, that takes care of that.
[177:46.22]Alright, saved.
[177:56.73]1, 2, 3, 4, 7.
[178:00.79]I've got a lot to erase here.
[178:10.98]Alright.
[178:16.67]That's two again.
[178:18.87]Four.
[178:24.85]I think it's ResidentSleeper.
[178:28.84]Close!
[178:29.56]Close.
[178:29.88]Very close.
[178:33.62]So this is a food.
[178:34.56]What type of food is this?
[178:43.93]Um... Uh oh.
[179:02.74]Oh no.
[179:07.19]Oh no.
[179:30.33]And then... And then... Oh, it's so close!
[179:39.17]It's right here!
[179:45.74]Got it.
[179:46.38]What is it?
[179:47.74]Cookie?
[179:49.28]It looks like a croissant.
[179:51.98]Look at that croissant.
[179:54.03]A lot of you did, actually.
[179:54.97]Nice work.
[180:02.12]Meme food?
[180:04.78]I love croissants.
[180:05.54]The problem with croissants is I never order them because it doesn't matter how you try to eat a croissant.
[180:12.66]You get sawdust all over you like you're in shop class.
[180:17.18]Bite into a croissant and there's just shavings of wood.
[180:21.38]Everywhere.
[180:24.36]Don't eat that shit in your car.
[180:31.47]Like, you made a birdhouse.
[180:33.81]In, like, the... In your passenger side.
[180:35.63]10, 11, 12.
[180:38.51]Alright, it's 15.
[180:39.61]This is construction.
[180:41.81]Speaking of construction.
[180:48.30]And don't eat in your car.
[180:49.02]Pay attention to the damn road.
[180:50.06]Alright, so we got 11, 12, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, so...
[181:00.18]11 12 13 14 12 13 14 15. uh-huh okay what about over here 10 take a look at this 11 12 13 14 15.
[181:05.49]10 11 12 13 14 15. cool sick nice yeah
[181:29.93]This is definitely not the three.
[181:35.23]God, I love Picross.
[181:36.17]I have an unhealthy obsession with these games for some reason.
[181:38.65]Me too.
[181:41.09]I come back to it.
[181:43.78]They have a couple of great ones for iPad.
[181:48.92]I just open my mouth and lie in bed on iPad and play these maybe like once or twice a week.
[181:55.48]Picross, yeah.
[181:56.14]I say Picross because it's... It's like saying Reese's.
[182:01.01]Reese's Pieces.
[182:02.43]I don't say Reese's Pieces.
[182:05.59]We've had a conversation about this, I know, but, you know, it's nice to come back and see how we're doing in that conversation.
[182:19.92]Alright, so now what?
[182:24.72]Well, that's not a three.
[182:27.76]Neither is that.
[182:29.58]Narrow down our 11 here.
[182:40.81]Doesn't help.
[182:42.25]Very much.
[182:46.41]It's Reese's.
[182:48.87]There's no wrong way to eat a Reese's.
[182:59.26]There's no wrong way to say Reese's, either.
[183:04.25]Alright, let's put this to bed once and for all.
[183:08.72]Everyone's saying I'm wrong.
[183:09.92]You're wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.
[183:18.11]Let's see.
[183:18.77]I'm curious.
[183:47.84]What is it?
[183:50.28]I just want to get a chat's opinion of the whole thing.
[183:58.63]Every stream is the same argument over pronunciation.
[184:01.47]Yeah, some people have accents, some people say things differently.
[184:05.21]Come on.
[184:11.21]That's one, so two, space one, so it could be there, and then here we go.
[184:19.85]So here we go.
[184:20.43]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[184:20.81]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[184:21.41]Thank you.
[184:22.05]Another one.
[184:23.41]I hate when there's too many ones.
[184:47.56]Well, so, uh, 30% of you guys from the sampling here say it that way.
[184:59.53]As a re-season.
[185:04.71]The bookstore is closing.
[185:07.28]No, I'm like, I'm not leaving.
[185:11.64]I'm not leaving the bookstore.
[185:20.54]What else can I do here?
[185:24.79]They're shitposting.
[185:27.89]So?
[185:34.33]Well, it's definitely not down here.
[185:35.65]Because this is the three.
[185:39.05]One, two, three.
[185:39.83]So look at that.
[185:45.17]We got our nine.
[185:48.89]And our two.
[185:58.68]Is it the whole thing?
[185:59.24]Oh, I'm stupid!
[186:00.98]Just fucking Reesey posting.
[186:07.19]Reesey's PCs.
[186:09.07]That's how I've been saying it since I was a kid.
[186:10.91]I can't change it now.
[186:20.97]I have to... No, Reesey's PCs.
[186:24.11]Then you were wrong as a kid.
[186:28.65]That's fine.
[186:31.25]I like how it sounds better.
[186:32.33]Fair enough.
[186:50.16]There's one in here somewhere.
[186:57.59]No.
[186:58.79]That's 10.
[186:59.19]Might be here.
[187:02.05]2.
[187:02.07]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[187:03.01]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[187:04.42]Something's wrong here.
[187:07.46]What's wrong here?
[187:27.45]Now this is alright.
[187:28.11]This is fine, right?
[187:46.68]Um... It's okay.
[187:49.77]The future is now, old man.
[187:51.21]What do you mean?
[187:54.45]I don't know what that means.
[188:03.59]Maybe the future is now.
[188:13.46]Is that too many tens?
[188:21.65]Your time is up.
[188:22.41]My time is now.
[188:29.42]I got plenty of time.
[188:40.90]We got it.
[188:41.38]Well, one's one.
[188:42.70]One.
[188:43.04]Three.
[188:45.90]One.
[188:46.04]This is some kind of construction.
[188:49.97]Was it building material?
[188:52.59]Wood?
[188:52.87]I would say wood.
[189:10.43]This could be 1, 1, 3.
[189:11.89]I don't want to blow it.
[189:15.59]But this, on the other hand, this is 3 here.
[189:17.52]How does that change this?
[189:21.80]Alright.
[189:25.10]Okay, where's this last 3?
[189:36.59]Right here?
[189:37.57]No, don't guess.
[189:41.40]One, three.
[189:44.91]One, one.
[189:45.57]There's the three.
[189:47.35]Make sure I don't miss any places I can fill in.
[189:55.54]Right there, there's the three.
[189:58.72]And there's the... Right there and right there.
[190:04.10]Alright, what is it?
[190:10.95]Stairs?
[190:14.68]Oh, damn.
[190:15.20]Okay.
[190:17.96]I think that makes sense.
[190:18.94]A lot of twos.
[190:22.66]2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[190:23.65]Damn it.
[190:23.91]Not enough twos.
[190:40.77]We can start off down here, though.
[190:42.27]That's good.
[190:49.03]This whole bottom area is just free.
[190:53.88]Cool.
[190:55.78]So that helps a lot.
[190:59.76]And there's our three right here.
[191:01.18]Perfect.
[191:01.52]There's another two.
[191:02.55]Another two.
[191:03.01]And that's a one.
[191:07.56]Another two, yeah.
[191:08.70]Shitload of twos.
[191:09.62]Keep that in mind while we're progressing.
[191:15.96]Two, three.
[191:16.98]There's another two here.
[191:23.75]More twos.
[191:24.49]Two, two, two, two, two, two, two, two.
[191:27.29]It's probably mirrored, right?
[191:29.15]I would assume.
[191:31.29]Is it mirrored?
[191:32.05]No, it's not.
[191:35.67]It's my turn.
[191:41.96]Oh, it's my turn.
[191:50.05]This is three.
[191:50.91]There's another one.
[191:51.73]Alright.
[191:53.91]So, weirdly enough, this is not mirrored.
[191:55.85]Why?
[191:56.11]2, 2, 1, 1, 2.
[191:58.78]2, 1, 1, 1, 2.
[191:59.16]I'd like a turn, please.
[192:00.54]No.
[192:00.84]No.
[192:11.55]So this is from Fantasy.
[192:14.99]Whatever that means.
[192:17.83]Concerned that this is wrong already.
[192:19.63]But I don't think it is.
[192:20.29]Alright, there's too many spaces here.
[192:28.31]What about here?
[192:30.29]This is another one, another one, and another one.
[192:34.08]Okay.
[192:35.80]Is he enough?
[192:36.34]Same thing over here.
[192:40.18]That's all I can go off of at the moment.
[192:43.01]No, this, like, fucks with my head.
[192:52.45]Alright, slow down.
[192:54.20]One, two, three, four.
[192:59.58]One, two, three, four.
[193:01.10]So none of these in the middle are going to be filled in.
[193:07.99]Any others like that?
[193:08.69]Yeah, three.
[193:09.43]One, two, three.
[193:14.09]Alright.
[193:16.50]Any more like that?
[193:21.10]Huh.
[193:22.62]Maybe.
[193:26.04]What is telling you to fill in what squares?
[193:29.29]We're, like, really relaxed.
[193:31.31]We're just chill now.
[193:33.23]I can explain it.
[193:33.79]Because there are actually people that are asking questions.
[193:42.33]You know, people are asking questions.
[193:47.49]So let's start with this.
[193:51.52]The cubes that you're filling in correspond to the numbers.
[193:55.38]So for instance, three.
[193:57.02]That means that there has to be three squares filled in in a row for this number here.
[194:02.02]This way.
[194:02.36]Right, because it's on this row.
[194:05.48]Now, the one here means that after the three, there has to be at least one space before that one comes into play.
[194:15.79]Right?
[194:17.93]So, again, let's just say for the sake of just doing it, that it was three, space, one, space, right?
[194:26.52]Because there's a space before this one.
[194:29.30]One, space, two, right?
[194:31.58]That would be... This is not correct, but...
[194:34.78]That space can be 1 or it can be 8.
[194:37.44]Doesn't matter.
[194:39.98]And you're supposed to logically deduce... I just fucked up this whole line.
[194:46.13]What was it?
[194:48.43]No, okay, I'm fine.
[194:54.63]That is only 1, yeah.
[194:56.41]So... If it's 15 by 15, you start, for instance, see how I started down here?
[195:01.68]Filled in all 15.
[195:04.17]all 15 again and that completed these rows now what happens is then take a look up here right because this is the top of the grid this is the bottom of the grid so you work from the bottom up here so see how that's two both are filled in here that's done so then you put a marker here because you know that there has to be at least one space
[195:29.68]See how down here, once I filled in this row, again, there's three.
[195:33.54]One, two, three has to get filled in.
[195:34.74]Marker has to go here.
[195:40.06]It's very interesting, very relaxing, and it makes a picture.
[195:42.51]That's the best part.
[195:45.61]Okay, but how do you play it?
[195:51.83]Okay, but how do you play it?
[196:00.76]You know how to play.
[196:08.68]I don't get it.
[196:11.21]I'll make it really easy after this level.
[196:14.43]For the... Handful of people.
[196:16.29]Yeah, there's 2,500 people here.
[196:18.53]Maybe 2,400 of you get it.
[196:21.07]But what about the new people that came in that just want to... You know, that are curious?
[196:26.18]We're just hanging out.
[196:26.82]It's not like... It's not a big deal.
[196:30.10]Not a big deal at all.
[196:31.64]It's fine.
[196:36.62]Alright, so let's get back to it.
[196:38.38]Uh, three.
[196:44.24]I said sarcasm.
[196:45.14]No, that's an old reference.
[196:50.01]This could be the one.
[196:50.73]Because then that's two.
[196:55.63]But I did get myself this, which is good.
[196:57.51]So this could be 1, 2, 3, 4.
[196:59.31]1, 2, 3, 4.
[197:01.80]So... Okay.
[197:14.08]No, I don't have that info.
[197:18.99]Because that would mean it could be here, but it's not.
[197:22.23]So I got another 2, right?
[197:24.11]Because it's 2, 2...
[197:26.96]Two.
[197:29.68]Same thing on this one right now.
[197:30.60]That's two, one.
[197:31.30]So that's three, one.
[197:35.02]That's a one, which makes this the three.
[197:38.06]Perfect, done.
[197:42.77]No info required.
[197:44.25]Did somebody just guess ham?
[197:49.83]Why would this be ham?
[197:50.65]Two, one.
[197:52.91]Two, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[197:54.03]Two, one.
[197:56.62]That's one.
[197:58.18]Wait a minute.
[197:58.54]Two, one, one.
[197:59.50]This could be two.
[198:03.98]What about this one?
[198:04.60]Two, two, two.
[198:11.19]Need more info down here.
[198:21.31]Yes.
[198:22.13]Space Invader.
[198:23.13]Now that's a pretty good one.
[198:24.42]That's actually a really good guess.
[198:27.56]It very well could be.
[198:31.78]Let's fill this shit in, because this has to be here or here.
[198:38.73]And then one, two, three.
[198:40.05]This is all... No?
[198:44.45]And this is filled in.
[198:47.33]Two, two.
[198:49.57]Two, two.
[198:50.49]This is done.
[198:51.09]Okay, nice.
[198:54.81]Is it?
[198:55.36]I'm confused.
[199:01.00]And then lead us up here.
[199:01.98]This is 4, 1.
[199:02.58]4, 1, 2.
[199:02.88]4, 2.
[199:02.92]4, 1, 2.
[199:04.58]4, 1.
[199:04.68]Could be up there.
[199:06.32]4, 1, 1.
[199:08.42]But that could be 1, 1.
[199:11.66]So let's leave that here for a second.
[199:27.69]Let's see what we did up here.
[199:28.43]This is one.
[199:29.35]This is three.
[199:31.95]There's the two.
[199:32.93]Nice.
[199:40.56]Still not sure about down here.
[199:41.66]That's two, one, one, three.
[199:48.06]So could this be two, one, one, three?
[199:51.53]No, this is it.
[199:58.91]So this could be anywhere here.
[200:00.11]Alright, got that though.
[200:10.02]Two, three, two, one.
[200:13.36]Alright, this is interesting.
[200:15.18]It's either here or here.
[200:20.02]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[200:22.98]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[200:25.36]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[200:29.70]I can't denominate this.
[200:30.70]Oh, let me see here.
[200:39.48]Alright, now I got... No, no, no.
[200:40.20]I got this now.
[200:40.92]So that's... 2, 1.
[200:41.30]1, 2?
[200:42.48]Right?
[200:43.10]Because then now...
[201:00.43]is that this would be three.
[201:02.11]Okay.
[201:10.44]Don't want to get sloppy.
[201:11.42]I'm missing a lot over here.
[201:16.10]Let's see.
[201:16.40]Two.
[201:16.86]One.
[201:20.76]One.
[201:21.86]One.
[201:22.68]Two.
[201:23.84]That's four.
[201:24.72]Close it up.
[201:25.74]That's three.
[201:26.20]Close it.
[201:26.88]This is done now.
[201:27.74]Alright.
[201:28.20]I'm almost done.
[201:30.55]Maybe this actually might be a Space Invader.
[201:38.47]I have nothing in this row.
[201:40.19]How?
[201:43.29]1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2.
[201:46.39]No.
[201:46.83]For some reason I thought it was going to count higher than that.
[201:54.43]There's the 2 and there's the 1.
[201:57.51]Yes!
[202:01.18]So, well, didn't fill that one in.
[202:10.82]Alright.
[202:12.04]Where are you?
[202:21.40]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[202:23.38]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[202:27.24]Over here.
[202:27.80]I'm over here.
[202:42.90]Well, it could be here.
[202:46.39]Two.
[202:47.99]Two.
[202:50.01]Three.
[202:50.75]Well, the one is obviously right there.
[202:59.95]In there somewhere, that's done.
[203:04.44]There's three.
[203:06.66]Alright.
[203:08.50]Closing in.
[203:13.74]Six.
[203:14.16]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[203:16.83]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[203:20.13]Seal it.
[203:21.01]Two.
[203:21.71]Two.
[203:22.11]What is it?
[203:25.27]Spider?
[203:27.21]Space Invader?
[203:28.91]It's a cave.
[203:31.13]A dungeon.
[203:37.19]Nobody got it.
[203:37.73]I don't know how you would have.
[203:44.97]This is a very long music track.
[203:47.13]We've been listening to this for an hour and 44 minutes.
[203:51.05]That's kind of surprising.
[203:51.77]Alright, electronic.
[203:54.37]What time is it?
[203:54.77]How are we doing?
[203:57.67]Six hours.
[204:01.35]I'm still alright.
[204:02.23]I'm still just hanging out.
[204:03.78]We're not done.
[204:05.34]I'm going to go for like another little while.
[204:10.46]Put on the Tetris OST.
[204:22.23]But we're so relaxed.
[204:23.29]Alright, this is Tetris 99, full official soundtrack.
[204:45.19]Regular Tet, like you mean like the dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.
[205:04.08]You can fill this whole thing in.
[205:37.47]Any more ones?
[205:44.77]Any more?
[205:45.03]Wait, it's filling the zeros first.
[205:46.22]What the hell am I doing?
[205:46.88]Alright, any more?
[205:54.98]Well, I found the first one.
[205:58.72]And then it could be... 1, 2, 3, 4.
[206:00.45]1, 2, 3, 4.
[206:06.50]Nice.
[206:06.86]Fill that out.
[206:09.75]How are we now?
[206:10.69]One still.
[206:16.44]By this point, you should have consumed at least 24 ounces of water.
[206:19.28]I'm probably pretty close.
[206:23.89]I've had a glass of water here the whole time.
[206:38.14]Well, this is the six.
[206:41.75]Therefore, if this is the six, then this has to be 1-1.
[206:45.99]That's info I don't have, but I can do at least those two.
[207:03.78]What's this song called?
[207:04.56]This is called Tetris 99 Main Theme.
[207:09.06]You can download it off of the internet somewhere and enjoy it with your friends.
[207:15.18]You can throw a party if you wanted to.
[207:18.74]And put it on a six and a half hour repeat.
[207:22.59]You could.
[207:23.55]I'm not saying you should, but I'm just saying it's possible.
[207:31.32]Torrenting Tetris music.
[207:33.48]No, that's not what I mean.
[207:39.30]This has to be the six.
[207:43.42]Right?
[207:43.93]Yeah.
[207:44.31]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[207:46.11]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[207:48.75]Yeah.
[208:02.42]One of these is the two.
[208:04.18]This one's probably the two.
[208:08.99]If not, then it's down here.
[208:10.73]Well, here's the 8.
[208:21.74]Fuck!
[208:23.74]What?
[208:23.98]How much did I fill in?
[208:24.74]I forget.
[208:27.26]Oh, shit.
[208:27.98]I don't know.
[208:28.94]I'm just gonna go like this.
[208:34.63]That's more info than I had before.
[208:36.03]I'm okay.
[208:45.17]Is it all filled in?
[208:51.42]Get a one and then a two up here somewhere.
[208:56.36]This is something electronic.
[209:04.25]Six.
[209:08.29]So many ones.
[209:11.07]Three, one.
[209:14.74]three more ones alright what is this two you want the pirate marching band uh why
[209:46.01]Do you really want me to put on the pirate marching band right now?
[209:54.97]Okay.
[209:56.73]I, okay.
[209:57.57]Hold on a minute.
[210:00.09]This video has almost a million views.
[210:04.14]There's a 737, 34,000 view video and then a 173,000 reupload for 10 hours.
[210:07.32]This video has been seen a million times?
[210:09.48]Really?
[210:09.62]I didn't even know that, holy shit.
[210:11.26]Here it comes.
[210:41.88]Little did I know that this year this many years later the stupid thing that I did Played at half speed Also not even true
[211:04.89]This is how I found out about you.
[211:08.03]I imagine that conversation.
[211:09.41]Hey, here's this guy that I have watch.
[211:16.31]Check him out!
[211:19.11]There's two.
[211:34.53]Don't you wish this was broadcasted nationally 4am?
[211:38.90]At... On everyone's alarm clocks.
[211:42.44]I'm not entirely certain that I would like to do that.
[211:46.90]Because that would probably get really bad.
[211:48.57]Something that's autoplayed.
[211:52.89]Uh, this is YMCA.
[211:55.99]But it's a twi- it's got a twist.
[212:04.31]How long is this?
[212:20.77]There are so many rat remixes.
[212:23.35]I've heard a bunch of them.
[212:25.75]Where am I going here?
[212:26.55]Probably down here.
[212:40.35]I can't focus on anything else.
[212:46.93]Two.
[212:50.07]Three, aye.
[212:51.17]Uh, six.
[212:53.64]One, six.
[212:56.88]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[212:58.90]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[213:01.34]Ah.
[213:01.74]Three.
[213:02.10]One.
[213:02.26]One.
[213:14.23]I'm getting speech jammed.
[213:17.49]It's still going.
[213:30.76]I can't do it with this music playing.
[213:36.58]Alright, that's it.
[213:38.98]Why did I take this long to play these songs?
[213:41.28]I don't know.
[213:42.72]They just kind of never came up.
[213:48.94]I need more info!
[213:52.60]A poor craftsman blames his tools.
[213:55.26]Or... Okay, if you were making a birdhouse and I came in and started going, Wretch!
[213:59.33]Wretch!
[213:59.77]We had a wretch!
[214:01.81]In your ear, you'd probably be like, What are you doing?
[214:14.26]No, no, no.
[214:14.94]What's the next one?
[214:16.44]This is the mixtape.
[214:35.57]I can't.
[214:41.52]Yeah, I know that that's on osu.
[214:44.80]Where am I?
[214:45.12]I'm like going forward, forward, forward.
[214:48.30]I skipped the best part?
[214:49.56]What do you mean the best part?
[214:53.25]What happened to my smooth jazz?
[214:55.39]I was working on my brain function.
[215:02.15]How long does it take you to make those lyrics?
[215:05.81]Uh... 6 or 7 minutes, probably.
[215:09.03]Maybe 10 minutes.
[215:10.67]There's a new one that I have.
[215:13.54]And it was supposed to be for the third one.
[215:15.56]I might as well just do it.
[215:16.40]Might as well just tell you what it was.
[215:20.18]Yeah.
[215:21.40]Well, this is a secret chill-out stream.
[215:24.88]Would you like to upload the lyrics for the third Rat song?
[215:30.79]Because I can't imagine a time where I'm going to be able to work on it for real.
[215:35.10]And if you hear it, it's fine.
[215:37.26]So it was a little play on words.
[215:42.22]It's the same sentence, but three times means different things.
[215:47.65]You ready?
[215:49.19]So it starts off like a rap beat almost.
[215:53.53]And it goes...
[215:56.85]Where the rats, where the rats, yes, where the rats.
[215:59.92]Where they at, where they at, yeah, where the rats.
[216:02.42]Where the rats, where the rats, yes, where the rats.
[216:04.48]Where they at, where they at, where they at, where they at.
[216:08.84]Where the rats, where the rats, yes, where the rats.
[216:10.80]Where they at, where they at, yeah, where the rats.
[216:12.82]Where the rats, where the rats, yes, where the rats.
[216:14.81]Where they at, where they at, where they at, where they at.
[216:23.03]There you go.
[216:23.57]That actually was the whole song.
[216:35.34]That's how it's gonna be like bunch of fucking trumpets Someone's gonna make a real one.
[216:45.13]That's fine Yeah, it was where the rats where the rats just where the rats where they at where they at.
[216:51.20]Yeah, where the rats Like this, you know now you already you know
[217:04.64]Yeah, like, where are the rats?
[217:05.86]Then where are the rats?
[217:08.98]Where they at?
[217:10.92]They're gonna come out of the sewers and shit while it was playing.
[217:14.16]They're all gonna get more crowded, more people, more rats singing at the same time.
[217:20.85]I swear to God, that's the song.
[217:22.67]That is the song.
[217:30.93]Am I just gonna make it?
[217:31.79]I'll make it right now.
[217:32.87]Yeah, fuck it.
[217:33.25]I'll be right back.
[222:10.12]Hold on, I'm still going.
[222:16.83]Remember I said 7 to 8 minutes?
[222:18.23]That was probably a lie.
[222:19.13]Probably took like 30.
[222:19.61]Probably like an hour.
[222:24.33]Hold on, let me make sure this is going here.
[222:27.25]I wasn't just gonna pull a song from Royalty Free, I was gonna have it made.
[222:30.42]So there's no song to go along with it.
[222:34.36]Hold on, I gotta zoom in here.
[222:39.69]Want me to do a take for you guys?
[222:48.69]Oh yeah, here comes a take, a live take.
[222:53.51]I'm gonna do one part of it.
[222:55.03]It's easier doing two breaths.
[222:59.09]Let's just go like this.
[223:04.00]Hold on.
[223:11.58]That sounds a little bit cleaner.
[223:15.76]I'll just make the fucking thing right now.
[223:21.13]Hold on.
[223:22.11]It's got to be louder, though.
[223:23.45]It's kind of soft.
[223:30.60]I'll just do a little beatbox behind it.
[223:37.54]Let's make sure, let's see.
[223:40.20]Alright, we'll need to do that a little higher than that.
[223:57.15]Not that much.
[224:03.48]Rat lore incoming.
[224:07.04]I wouldn't say rat lore.
[224:08.44]Let's see, how does this sound?
[224:11.76]No.
[224:12.64]A little off here.
[224:17.37]I moved it too much.
[224:23.51]I need to really... Unfortunately, I have to crank my microphone for this.
[224:28.80]I really don't think I can actually do it on stream.
[224:30.84]That's way off key as well.
[224:34.22]Way off key!
[224:35.28]It's gotta change.
[224:40.52]I was here.
[224:40.86]That's not bad.
[224:41.36]Let me turn this up.
[224:42.26]Wait a minute.
[225:09.47]Let me mute this one.
[225:11.23]I don't like it.
[225:19.58]I am here.
[225:21.80]Six years later, he did it on stream in 20 minutes.
[225:34.21]Way to retch, way to retch, yes, way to retch.
[225:36.45]Perfect.
[225:37.03]Okay.
[225:37.15]How about the next part?
[225:38.76]Way to get, way to get.
[225:40.28]Next part is going to be a little bit more.
[225:41.44]A little bit more synced up here.
[225:50.31]Oh, I can't grab this.
[225:56.55]What the hell are you doing, man?
[226:03.66]Audacity, why do you suck?
[226:09.63]What's going on here?
[226:10.19]How can I not move this?
[226:11.55]Oh.
[226:12.81]That's why.
[226:23.10]Something is wrong here.
[226:23.92]What's going on?
[226:30.62]Audacity, what are you doing?
[226:35.03]audacity what are you doing to me why can I not drag this what the hell what the is going on here for some reason I cannot move the track anymore it's like broken
[227:00.25]You know, Audacity really is terrible for recording tracks.
[227:03.33]But, I kind of just threw this open.
[227:05.25]So.
[227:09.83]I don't understand why I can't do this.
[227:11.73]I've done this probably a thousand times.
[227:14.96]And I cannot select this and move it.
[227:17.08]And now magically, I didn't even... Magic!
[227:19.86]I can do it now.
[227:21.36]Somebody has magic fucking potions.
[227:26.30]Okay.
[227:31.35]Let's see how this sounds.
[227:37.00]Not bad.
[227:38.96]Not bad.
[227:39.50]Maybe it needs a little bit more on the end here.
[227:43.64]And then I'm going to copy it once.
[227:47.22]And I'll give you a real take.
[227:56.52]How's this?
[227:57.94]Good.
[227:58.14]Pull that forward a little.
[227:59.60]Just a hair.
[228:00.16]Alright.
[228:00.42]Here comes a new take.
[228:25.74]I gotta go a little deeper than that.
[228:27.38]Let's see how that one sounds.
[228:54.20]Yeah, the problem with Audacity is when you record, it puts everything else off sync for some reason.
[228:59.00]You kinda have to go back in.
[229:05.18]This is just for fun.
[229:05.95]I'm not really trying to get it perfect or anything.
[229:07.29]I just wanted to get you an idea.
[229:08.21]I need two headphones in for this.
[229:09.85]I don't like that one.
[229:24.83]I like the end of that, though.
[229:29.37]Wait a yet, wait a yet, yeah, wait a rat.
[229:32.31]Wait a yet, wait a yet, yeah, wait a rat.
[229:38.98]Wait a rat, wait a rat, yes, wait a rat.
[229:41.14]Wait a yet, wait a yet, yeah, wait a rat.
[229:43.78]No.
[229:45.10]Do it again.
[229:46.72]It's gonna be like, wait a yet.
[229:49.10]Wait a yet.
[229:51.96]Wait a rat, wait a rat, yes, wait a rat.
[229:56.79]Wait a rat, wait a rat, yes, wait a rat.
[229:58.79]Fucking Audacity.
[230:00.75]Wait a rat, wait a rat, yes, wait a rat.
[230:02.91]Wait a rat, wait a rat, yes, wait a rat.
[230:11.73]No, why?
[230:13.77]Wait a rat, wait a rat, yes, wait a rat.
[230:27.54]Wait a wretch, wait a wretch, yes, wait a wretch.
[230:31.42]Okay.
[230:33.00]Let's change that a little bit.
[230:37.90]Wait a wretch, wait a wretch, yes, wait a wretch.
[230:40.05]No.
[230:44.99]This is how you do it, man.
[230:46.09]This is what I used to do.
[230:46.93]I used to sit here and fucking do this all day.
[230:52.91]Wait a wretch, wait a wretch, yes, wait a wretch.
[230:55.77]That's not so fucking wrong.
[230:59.54]That's too low.
[230:59.96]That's the tone I'm looking for.
[231:26.12]I think we can get this copied a couple times.
[231:28.45]This one's a little too low.
[231:32.61]I'm gonna give another take here.
[231:47.63]No, but it could be like, where the rats?
[231:49.95]Where the rats?
[231:52.69]Where the rats?
[231:54.27]Nope, that's wrong.
[231:56.71]Where the rats?
[231:57.25]Where the rats?
[231:58.05]Where the rats?
[232:04.55]Where the rats?
[232:05.29]Where the rats?
[232:12.90]Nope.
[232:25.41]Move this to creative I'd have to show it It comes up like that I'm like I'm naked right now in front of you guys, you know, you understand that right?
[232:41.35]You're seeing me completely like undress in front of you
[232:50.10]We're the rats, we're the rats, yes, we're the rats, we're the yats, we're the yats, yeah, we're the rats.
[232:56.44]He's fucking naked.
[232:58.95]Let me just get the next part, because this is fine.
[233:01.15]The rats, we're the yats, we're the yats, yeah, we're the rats.
[233:05.21]This part needs to be moved, but... Yeah, we're the rats.
[233:10.44]Okay, then it's... We're the rats, we're the rats, yes, we're the rats, we're the yats, we're the yats, we're the yats, we're the yats.
[233:19.26]The BRB screen is still on, you clown.
[233:49.79]I like that end here.
[233:50.67]Let me just open this.
[233:51.71]Let's just get the window.
[233:53.11]Okay.
[233:53.33]I should be able to see it now.
[234:20.81]At least I think you can.
[234:21.45]Can you see it?
[234:21.91]No.
[234:22.07]I have to move this.
[234:29.42]Hey, look at that.
[234:37.77]Okay, so as you see here.
[234:38.91]I like the end here.
[234:43.23]I don't like the beginning.
[234:49.26]I like that part.
[234:50.10]Let me see.
[235:22.93]That's almost unhuman how much that is the same.
[235:33.42]That's way too close.
[235:38.64]Let's go to change the pitch a little bit.
[235:45.29]Let's drop it a lot, see what happens.
[235:51.86]Winner yet, winner yet, winner yet, winner yet.
[235:55.98]What the fuck did you do, Audacity?
[235:59.48]I gotta get a really, really mean one too.
[236:02.68]This one a little bit louder Winner yet, winner yet, winner yet, winner yet
[236:27.46]Every other with-a-hat should be lower.
[236:30.04]With-a-hat, with-a-hat, with-a-hat, with-a-hat Well, this is just- I don't have to make it all- With-a-hat, with-a-hat, with-a-hat, with-a-hat.
[236:41.79]Just so you can see what I was talking about.
[236:48.63]With-a-hat, with-a-rat, with-a-rat, with-a-rat.
[236:51.54]With-a-rat, with-a-rat, with-a-rat.
[236:58.55]I wonder how that, that probably was really badly synced.
[237:02.94]Oh, I just want this one.
[237:37.98]This is gonna sound off, though.
[237:43.01]Yeah, that's gonna be pulled in.
[237:44.47]Or I could just, yeah.
[238:15.54]Yeah, I would go through and make these sound a lot better, and I would change pitches, and I would drop levels, but we're kind of just dicking around.
[238:27.45]Because the stream's probably over after I finish this puzzle.
[238:44.25]The ending is close.
[238:45.75]We just need to have some changes in level and toning.
[239:02.15]It's a little off, but it's okay.
[239:04.53]You see the rough, rough, rough, rough idea.
[239:16.39]There you go.
[239:21.53]This whole thing has to come in.
[239:22.85]Get rid of this.
[239:50.63]It could even be different rats coming up.
[239:54.93]It's the beginning.
[239:56.80]I don't like the beginning of this.
[240:00.58]If I were to spend a bunch of time on this, I would redo this whole part here.
[240:17.62]I'm gonna play it once, once through.
[240:21.02]That's not it.
[240:22.16]That was a mistake.
[240:23.93]Yeah, it changes tonally here, which I would have tried to do one take.
[240:43.61]I would probably start over and do the whole thing again.
[240:47.83]If I'm honest with you.
[240:50.49]But yeah, that's what the third rat song is going to be.
[240:59.69]This would go over a couple times.
[241:01.95]Where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where they at, where they at, yeah.
[241:04.33]Where the rats, where the rats, where the rats, where they at, where they at, where they at, where they at, where the rats, where the rats, yes, where the rats.
[241:10.15]It would do it like probably two or three times.
[241:21.55]Do I usually record to a beat?
[241:22.91]Well, the thing, the first one and the second one were recorded to already available songs.
[241:29.87]I was going to have somebody make this song.
[241:39.47]Don't give it up, Luffy.
[241:41.97]Give it up, give it up, give it up.
[241:43.57]Whatever.
[241:46.74]Creative difference.
[241:50.88]Wait a second.
[241:52.36]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[241:58.33]I don't... No, hold on.
[242:07.01]There once was a man named Gold Roger, who was king of the pirates.
[242:11.23]He had fame, power, and wealth beyond your wildest dreams.
[242:14.81]Before they hung him from the gallows, these were the final words he said.
[242:19.41]My fortune is yours for the take.
[242:22.37]Since pirates, the grand line, searching for one piece, the treasure that would make their dreams come true.
[242:29.38]Yo!
[242:29.96]Got your, got your, got your dreamin'.
[242:34.64]No, that's not even funny.
[242:36.38]Not even funny.
[242:38.00]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[242:44.19]No, that's not even fucking, come on.
[242:46.71]If that went to court, I wouldn't fucking lose, okay?
[242:49.74]I would win that case.
[242:52.06]Throw it out throw that out of court doesn't belong here
[243:24.64]Goldeneye faculty music?
[243:35.26]What the fuck are you talking about?
[244:05.98]That's perfect to go blind.
[244:07.32]How would you even fucking think about that?
[244:08.70]I have no idea.
[244:09.08]Alright, let's go back to the puzzle.
[244:37.73]Let's finish what we were doing here.
[244:41.43]And then I'm probably gonna call it.
[244:43.13]And we'll do VR tomorrow.
[244:45.99]Back into the headset.
[244:47.31]I feel pretty good.
[244:48.27]I'll be good to go.
[244:57.60]Holy shit, this was a puzzle stream.
[244:59.36]Yeah, it was.
[245:01.90]Gonna finish.
[245:02.30]This is electronics.
[245:04.62]What's on the plate for VR?
[245:05.60]I'm going to do Minecraft VR just to get it out of the way.
[245:18.37]And then after that, or maybe before that, depending on how hard it is to set that up, I do have at least three or four more VR games to play.
[245:30.62]And then we had a stream yesterday, stream today, stream tomorrow.
[245:35.10]And then after tomorrow, you're not going to see me for a few days.
[245:39.27]I'm taking a few days off in a row.
[245:43.19]I've got some company that's coming up.
[245:46.11]So I want to spend some time with them.
[245:48.25]So after tomorrow, you will not see me until three days later.
[245:54.82]Just want to make sure you tell you now.
[245:58.08]Alright.
[245:59.18]Finish this puzzle.
[246:01.34]And then I'm gonna call it for the night.
[246:07.66]I gotta clean this shit up.
[246:08.60]Yeah, I know.
[246:13.58]Fucking PictoPix again.
[246:15.12]No, look.
[246:17.96]You know, alright.
[246:18.78]I'm just gonna call it now.
[246:21.10]I'm just gonna call it now.
[246:22.81]That's the end of the stream.
[246:23.97]Thanks for coming.
[246:28.95]You know what?
[246:29.55]You guys do it.
[246:30.39]You guys finish it up.
[246:33.21]Alright.
[246:33.75]Let me finish this.
[246:37.29]Self-conscious streamer.
[246:38.79]It can't get over it.
[246:39.97]3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[246:48.51]Alright.
[246:49.01]6 has to go up this way.
[247:00.85]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[247:03.33]Let's just say it's probably up here.
[247:04.71]Has to be at least one of those.
[247:07.81]There's three!
[247:08.59]Am I gonna play Devil May Cry for Sekiro?
[247:13.54]I'm gonna play Sekiro day one.
[247:17.12]So the day that Sekiro launches, I will be streaming it.
[247:21.10]I'm going to enjoy that game.
[247:23.35]I'm gonna play very, very patiently.
[247:25.33]I'm gonna just love the fuck out of it.
[247:27.17]So...
[247:28.70]When is the gamer duel with Joel?
[247:30.70]That's a good question.
[247:32.42]Joel and I just recently became Discord friends.
[247:35.92]So probably not.
[247:37.31]Probably that's probably not going to happen until after I get back from seeing friends.
[247:44.57]We'll see.
[247:45.85]Anywho.
[247:47.15]How are we doing here?
[247:48.19]1, 2, 3.
[247:49.07]1, 2, 3.
[247:49.17]Don't have enough info for this, but we do have enough info to go here.
[247:55.92]Because that's that.
[248:01.78]After all this time, you know?
[248:10.32]Hmm.
[248:10.50]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[248:11.62]I just don't know which way.
[248:14.58]1, 1, 1.
[248:22.15]Is Discord friends marriage?
[248:24.67]I don't think so.
[248:26.21]I would say no.
[248:30.98]What about down here?
[248:40.33]I don't have enough info to fill that in.
[248:45.87]It's three and three, but I just don't have enough info.
[248:48.14]I need more up here, but how the fuck am I going to get that?
[248:51.88]I need to cancel some shit out up here.
[248:56.64]I could do this.
[248:59.52]which then lets me do that.
[249:00.82]Alright, keep going.
[249:03.62]So it's pretty much mirrored until down here.
[249:05.47]Six.
[249:25.82]one one I would save right here but it could be here too no no it couldn't no it couldn't no it could not let's go with this is done now alright that's enough info let's go
[249:53.60]That's three.
[249:54.78]Perfect.
[249:55.50]Three again.
[249:58.87]Alright.
[249:59.99]Getting there.
[250:01.03]Another three.
[250:04.49]This is the six.
[250:08.53]Perfect.
[250:09.29]Five is going to be right in the middle here.
[250:14.06]Feels good.
[250:22.03]Two, one, one, one, one.
[250:26.03]There's eight.
[250:28.67]Almost done.
[250:32.96]Cool.
[250:39.20]Two.
[250:41.84]Yes.
[250:43.60]Gotta be here, gotta be here.
[250:44.72]Close it, close it.
[250:48.06]There are four.
[250:49.92]Mm.
[250:53.72]It has to be right here.
[251:02.31]This is kind of freaking me out, though.
[251:03.71]It's going to be back this way.
[251:04.51]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[251:04.63]Maybe not.
[251:04.93]Okay, so... 2.
[251:05.13]2.
[251:05.15]Nice.
[251:05.39]Almost done.
[251:24.52]This is all filled in except the top rows here.
[251:26.94]Hmm.
[251:34.46]Interesting.
[251:40.59]What is it?
[251:43.69]CPU?
[251:45.85]Chip?
[251:46.43]Microchip.
[251:49.17]Good work, everybody.
[251:52.31]And that's it.
[251:52.79]I'm going to call it here.
[251:54.86]Thanks for watching this absolute mess of a fucking livestream.
[252:01.58]This is the third game.
[252:05.62]Had some technical issues with the first one.
[252:08.52]Second one was alright.
[252:10.96]It was good.
[252:11.78]I have nothing really bad to say about the second one.
[252:14.53]Except for the fact that I'd rather just chill and play Picross.
[252:22.12]Tomorrow, VR.
[252:24.34]We'll do a good four or five hours in VR tomorrow.
[252:27.14]And then I'm going to take the next few days off.
[252:30.46]See you real soon.
[252:31.06]Let's get to the bits and the subs.
[252:32.96]Thank you guys for sticking around.
[252:35.30]And again, sorry for a stream that was all over the place.
[252:40.66]Hope you still had fun.
[252:43.58]Let's move on to the end.
[252:48.46]Let's go.
[252:49.57]What do you say?
[252:57.67]Alright.
[252:59.77]See you tomorrow if you're taking off.
[253:04.05]If you're not taking off, we have a little bit of bits to get through.
[253:07.64]Not a whole lot, not a million.
[253:10.12]Let me open... Let me just get some shit open.
[253:19.09]Came to the last hour, but I had fun.
[253:20.49]I'm glad to hear that.
[253:21.39]Good.
[253:23.39]I think I'm not supposed to close my Twitch window when I had Audacity open somehow.
[253:35.60]Let's open it back up, please.
[253:47.53]Okay.
[253:51.55]Cool, cool, cool.
[253:55.09]So, let's go back.
[253:56.91]Earlier, about seven-ish hours ago, we had a 250 from Lazy Luke.
[254:08.77]No, this is yesterday.
[254:12.11]Sorry.
[254:13.63]I'm stupid.
[254:14.95]Here we go.
[254:15.33]Sad Vega.
[254:16.03]Thanks for the free bucks.
[254:18.04]Appreciate it.
[254:21.71]Space Channel 5 Part 1, baby.
[254:23.53]Woo, what a blast.
[254:25.55]I'm making cheesy gordita crunch tacos.
[254:27.67]Homemade, and boy, they're good.
[254:29.61]Also, did you up the cost of three to be read out loud?
[254:32.78]Are we still doing the ones?
[254:34.48]Very curious to know.
[254:35.54]Uh, $2.50.
[254:37.08]I'm sorry that you were so excited for Space Channel 5.
[254:39.08]I was too.
[254:40.96]Maybe I was doing something wrong.
[254:41.98]I don't think I was, though.
[254:43.17]Something was going... Something was wacky.
[254:47.11]250 is the minimum for me to read, and again, I want to make sure I reiterate this too.
[254:55.37]Just because you give 250 doesn't mean I'm going to read.
[254:59.55]Obviously something that I still have to be comfortable reading.
[255:01.65]If it's something that I don't really want to address or talk about, I may not address it.
[255:08.07]And a lot of times, sometimes people even put in their messages to not, you know, say these things.
[255:13.35]So...
[255:16.23]Fair enough?
[255:16.75]Fair enough.
[255:17.35]Right.
[255:17.97]But, it's 250.
[255:18.41]Uh... But again, it is also at my discretion.
[255:24.69]He didn't answer if he ate ass.
[255:25.89]I already did.
[255:26.45]I did.
[255:31.05]But anyways, uh, sad Vega.
[255:33.85]Glad you're feeling better.
[255:34.59]Also, whatever happened to Dr. A... Dr. Agon's... Uh, Dragon's Dogma?
[255:40.27]I was gonna try and play alongside you.
[255:42.15]So, you could have some pawns not named poopy pants or awful things.
[255:47.48]Hope we get back to that sometime soon.
[255:49.30]Isn't the creator interested in making a new one?
[255:54.42]I should have just played that today.
[255:55.86]I mean, Picross is just on the mind.
[256:01.74]I probably should have just opened that today.
[256:05.53]That would have been a perfect opportunity.
[256:08.37]Oops, oh well.
[256:11.01]It's coming out on Switch, that's amazing.
[256:14.32]But after Devil May Cry 5, you're gonna make another one, right?
[256:20.30]But thank you, SadVega.
[256:21.20]Thank you, ProceptProStar, for the five bucks.
[256:22.86]With the John Halo Master Chief Collection coming to PC, do you think you'll play those games on Steam?
[256:29.98]I'm gonna say no.
[256:32.71]I don't think so.
[256:34.57]Unless, like, people really want to see that.
[256:36.45]Would you guys really want to see me play Halo 1 on stream?
[256:41.19]The story mode?
[256:42.77]Is that something that people would want to watch?
[256:51.84]I feel like the Halo games are, you know, just kind of shooters with a story.
[257:01.74]I don't know if it's something I'd want to stream.
[257:05.85]They're great games, but just kind of a story shooter.
[257:12.23]The multiplayer?
[257:12.91]Are they turning on the multiplayer?
[257:16.66]Like, will Halo 2 be online on Steam?
[257:22.23]Well, that's a big deal.
[257:23.33]Okay, that's a big... I didn't know that they... I thought maybe they were just going to turn the servers off or something.
[257:30.40]It's just the... Okay, that's... I might even just play the multiplayer for fun.
[257:35.42]Community maps, too?
[257:36.28]Holy shit, that's amazing.
[257:39.48]That's a lot of money.
[257:44.14]Die335 just gave $200. $200.
[257:50.15]Holy shit.
[257:51.87]You just gave 20,000 bits.
[257:55.01]You just dropped a gigantic bit bomb.
[257:58.58]200 bucks.
[258:00.86]Uh, thank you, first of all, Dai.
[258:03.82]Been watching your videos since before Twitch back in 2011.
[258:07.08]Honest to god, best streamer I've ever watched.
[258:09.02]That's... Thank you.
[258:17.35]Anytime anybody says something like that, I always want to try to do better.
[258:25.53]That means an absolute fuckton.
[258:27.01]Thank you so much for the $200, guy.
[258:31.27]So much more money as well tonight.
[258:33.52]There was so much money from other people.
[258:35.76]50, 50, 50, 20, 20, 20, 30, 15, 15, 30, 30.
[258:38.24]Thank you guys all so much.
[258:39.16]For real.
[258:54.69]That's a shitload of money.
[259:00.21]I am spoiled rotten.
[259:04.86]I'm glad you think this stream is worth paying for.
[259:07.04]I'm gonna keep trying to do better.
[259:14.56]Very important point.
[259:17.42]You can always strive to do better, to try more, to do more things.
[259:24.68]So I appreciate it.
[259:28.72]Jess, you got it.
[259:29.58]Thanks for the 250.
[259:30.24]I think this was summarized history, but it sounds like slam poetry.
[259:35.39]What is it?
[259:36.43]Something that I said?
[259:37.89]War bad.
[259:42.55]Spice trading.
[259:44.47]Sugar, tobacco trading.
[259:47.87]economies collapses uh entrepreneurship industry steam am I playing the 100 000 pyramid natural gas what are we what's going on England England England America poetry America America
[260:15.70]Oh, that's the Seaman.
[260:17.00]The Seaman stream, right?
[260:18.28]Okay, I remember.
[260:18.86]That sounds like something my English teacher would do.
[260:26.57]You sure we're not the same person?
[260:29.49]Thank you, Jess, you got it for the $2.50 and the clip.
[260:33.65]Hey, Kristen, thanks for the five bucks.
[260:35.43]Left, right, choo-choo, hey, hey, hey.
[260:37.35]Left, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.
[260:41.63]That's a pretty good summary of Space Channel 5 Part 1.
[260:51.81]Thank you.
[260:58.08]I'm sad that I couldn't really get that to go.
[261:01.60]It was kind of futile.
[261:06.36]I didn't want to give that game a bad name because I love that series.
[261:10.56]I just love that game.
[261:15.95]It probably is the fact that I just didn't have a CRT.
[261:21.08]On the bright side, the VR game you think is a remake of Part 1.
[261:24.50]Well, that actually, the cards all fall in a perfect spot if that's true.
[261:28.86]So that's, we'll just play that.
[261:35.37]Uh, where are we?
[261:36.07]I got lost here.
[261:36.61]There we are.
[261:38.51]Hey, Grapple Mace, thanks for the $2.50.
[261:40.21]Any chance of another stream like Picross?
[261:42.95]I honestly loved it.
[261:44.59]P.S.
[261:45.19]Where are the Pikachu socks we bought you for Christmas?
[261:47.69]BibleThump.
[261:49.19]What a grapple mace.
[261:50.87]That was six hours ago.
[261:52.27]Any chance of another Picross stream?
[261:55.71]Well, if you are still here, there you go.
[261:59.43]If you're not here anymore and you might catch the VOD, I'm going to be happy about that.
[262:06.87]Thank you, though.
[262:07.82]Thank you, Freudian Weapon.
[262:09.68]I am here.
[262:10.36]Thank you for Picross.
[262:11.66]Thank you, grapple mace, for sticking around for that long.
[262:17.24]I hope you liked the Picross.
[262:19.50]And then Freudian Weapon of 250 from Freudian.
[262:22.26]This game makes me want to dance.
[262:23.84]I think the aliens are taking over my brain.
[262:26.44]Jerma nose wipe.
[262:27.66]Yes.
[262:28.68]They tend to do that.
[262:30.68]They tend to do that.
[262:37.47]We had... I'm getting... We had a bunch of community subs tonight.
[262:43.03]I think I missed some of them too.
[262:49.45]Let me see.
[262:50.98]The Lake Drinker had five community subs.
[262:57.56]Epic gave five community subs.
[262:58.82]Kazzy, five community subs.
[263:01.36]Thank you, guys.
[263:05.00]Also, Castillion, or Castaline gave 10 bucks.
[263:09.00]Hey Jerma, sending my love from New Zealand. It's been rough here given what's happened, but I just want to tell everyone that they're good people and a great community. Regards, a kiwi fan.
[263:10.93]That's absolutely fucking terrible what happened.
[263:12.01]Uh, actually, but last night I was just kind of reading up on it.
[263:14.34]And it's just, just fucking terrible.
[263:40.60]Yeah this shit is absolutely heartbreaking.
[263:44.00]It's one of those scenarios where you just- you just- you just wish that shit wasn't real.
[263:49.00]Just sitting there in bed last night just going over reading on my iPad different things and different- just seeing like what happened cause I- last night it was um somebody mentioned it.
[263:59.00]And I didn't even know what happened and then just- you put the- you know, you're lying down, you're just sitting there staring at the ceiling just going like: Why the fuck is this shit real?
[264:14.86]Absolutely fucking horrible tragedy.
[264:22.15]But thank you so much, Castlian.
[264:27.58]Thank you for your $10.
[264:29.46]And stay safe.
[264:42.86]And you read more about it today.
[264:43.98]That's why it's just, it's so... It's just such an awful fucking feeling.
[264:53.34]I just wish people were fucking better to each other.
[264:56.16]Really.
[265:00.37]It's awful, awful shit.
[265:10.21]But regardless...
[265:14.12]We're going to move on from that.
[265:20.10]Thank you again, Castalian, and again, stay safe, all of you.
[265:24.04]That goes for everybody.
[265:31.84]And right after that, there was $150 thrown in here from something, a rudder, Juno, Septo, something, they gave $100.
[265:42.18]Just dropping just huge stacks of money on this stream.
[265:47.95]Thank you, guys.
[265:49.97]Thank you, thank you, thank you from the bottom of my fucking heart.
[265:56.35]That's a lot of money.
[265:59.22]And Lakronda, 100 bucks.
[266:01.02]I just forgot how much money was back here.
[266:03.26]Lakronda, 100 bucks.
[266:04.26]Smashly, 50 bucks.
[266:05.10]Jesus.
[266:07.40]Jesus.
[266:19.01]You guys are too much.
[266:21.27]Really.
[266:27.15]Hydrate.
[266:29.39]I'm good.
[266:29.79]I got one here.
[266:30.62]When the stream's over, I'll go get something to drink.
[266:37.08]A hundred's not a hundred bucks, but any amount of money that somebody gives the stream is appreciated.
[266:41.92]I want to make that really clear.
[266:42.94]I know that some people say, no, $250...
[266:47.44]He's increasing the bits.
[266:48.20]What if he does it again?
[266:48.86]What if he does it again?
[266:50.26]If you give a cent, it's wildly appreciated.
[266:56.40]I don't want it to be one of those goal posts that I keep moving like, yeah, come on in here.
[266:59.99]You want to say something?
[267:00.93]That'll be fucking 10 bucks.
[267:03.75]That's not the intention.
[267:04.53]That's not why I'm doing it.
[267:05.45]That's not why I did it.
[267:08.33]You can't give a cent.
[267:09.77]Right, oh yeah, that is because if you, if one cent, you, ah, hold on.
[267:14.53]If you have one cent on bits, somebody can put a quarter down and just spam the chat with one cent donations.
[267:23.21]So that's why it's 25 cent minimum.
[267:29.90]If, if like 50 people bought a dollar and then all of them just spammed one cent, cheers.
[267:37.34]It would just be like, it would just be a mess.
[267:44.36]But he appreciates every one of those 25 cents.
[267:47.12]That's right.
[267:47.58]If you give one cent, he doesn't even know his own rules.
[267:56.17]But thank you.
[267:57.89]I've seen it happen.
[267:58.61]It's not pretty.
[268:02.08]Yes, it's true.
[268:05.07]We got Alf the Librarian.
[268:06.43]Thanks for 250.
[268:07.17]So I couldn't find a book because one of the richest men in the world already bought 50 copies.
[268:12.61]Do you want a history of the Dreamcast book?
[268:14.58]I already got one.
[268:16.94]Right here.
[268:19.30]It's the manual.
[268:19.96]It's everything I need to know.
[268:23.98]If you give him one cent, he tells you to fuck off.
[268:25.81]No, I don't.
[268:26.37]Hey, thank you, Bebraham.
[268:29.87]You gave 10 community subs earlier.
[268:32.31]Thank you.
[268:36.59]Another $50.
[268:37.55]I forgot how much fucking... Oh, my... Jesus.
[268:45.90]Natty Kins gave $50 a hundred.
[268:50.22]Right?
[268:51.02]How many?
[268:51.68]A hundred bucks?
[268:52.24]How many?
[268:53.08]My God.
[268:53.84]A hundred bucks.
[269:04.41]Jesus.
[269:04.85]Jesus.
[269:06.83]I've said it before, just you being here is enough.
[269:08.52]Now this cha- I don't have this without you watching.
[269:10.22]So...
[269:37.08]You guys are way more important.
[269:39.76]Money is not as important as you hanging out and having a good time.
[269:43.91]And enjoying this shit.
[269:51.99]Thank you.
[269:54.33]Somebody said about the socks.
[269:56.29]Yeah, they got lost in the mill.
[270:00.44]I can't say that anymore.
[270:07.87]I'll tell you the truth.
[270:09.09]Do you remember the liar?
[270:13.63]Somebody stole them.
[270:16.09]I bought them.
[270:17.50]They got sent to the door and somebody swiped them.
[270:23.06]Yeah.
[270:23.28]It's fucked up.
[270:25.74]I know.
[270:26.04]Somebody stole them from me.
[270:36.99]Oh, that's, that's fucked up.
[270:40.11]You want me to make another video?
[270:44.31]I just, like, every time I go to, like, buy them, something comes up, like, I hear, like, a fire alarm goes off, right?
[270:49.48]When I get, I'm hovering over purchase, and it's just, I gotta get out of here.
[270:54.32]The fire alarm's going off.
[270:55.74]It happens every time.
[271:01.67]You want me to buy you a new pair?
[271:02.91]No.
[271:03.75]This way.
[271:04.07]I got a plan for that, by the way.
[271:08.50]That says, I'm doing a bit voice.
[271:11.00]That's the problem when you broadcast yourself and record yourself hundreds of trillions of times.
[271:17.26]I can't sneak anything.
[271:19.51]Oh, I wonder if what he's saying is true.
[271:21.01]You've heard every cadence.
[271:22.67]You've heard every one of my mannerisms.
[271:24.83]I can't lie to anybody here.
[271:28.01]Even if I wanted to.
[271:28.81]It'd be impossible.
[271:35.02]What are you linking here?
[271:37.42]What is this?
[271:41.77]Terminal 985, Revelation.
[271:43.29]Oh, no.
[271:43.97]Oh, yeah.
[271:45.23]We watched that.
[271:49.99]Of course, you've got to span it.
[271:52.84]But it's all good.
[271:54.36]I've got a plan for those socks and the whale.
[271:59.24]But thank you, Tissue Boy.
[272:01.20]Thank you, Dork Cube, for the 250.
[272:02.20]Thank you.
[272:09.45]You say... I can't give you $50 like these other guys.
[272:16.00]I should feel bad about that, right?
[272:17.80]That I can't give you more money?
[272:23.16]You're... I know you're baiting me here.
[272:30.20]I'm not going to take the bait, but I'm going to tell you thanks for the $250, and you don't have to give $50.
[272:41.47]Speaking of $50, thank you, Communist Taco, for the $50.
[272:47.52]Maybe I will try the PlayStation 2 version, or I'll just wait for the VR.
[272:50.04]The VR one's coming out soon, right?
[272:58.02]I feel like the VR one will just be better anyways.
[273:02.11]Something or other, thanks for the $2.50.
[273:03.35]You like pickles.
[273:07.55]Yeah, I do.
[273:09.73]I like pickles.
[273:10.43]They taste good.
[273:12.83]I don't like sweet pickles.
[273:13.69]I like dill pickles.
[273:15.19]And they gotta be crunchy.
[273:16.93]None of these slippery, been inside of an old lady's mouth for 30 seconds, smeared out of their mouth and put into your sandwich.
[273:25.63]No.
[273:26.40]I want, like, the crunch, the snap pickles.
[273:30.72]The ones that have, like, not the ones that have water all over them.
[273:36.40]Sweet pickles I don't like at all.
[273:39.72]Was that, uh, was that meme with, um, Drake?
[273:43.51]Now, Sweet Pickle's like, no, no, no, no, uh, Dill Pickles, that's the one, pointin'.
[273:50.45]Right?
[273:54.97]That'll get, like, a thousand upvotes on Reddit somewhere.
[274:00.31]Even, it doesn't matter if it's, like, a bad reference.
[274:02.13]The ref, that's a terrible shit, like, dog shitpost meme.
[274:06.51]But it probably will get clicks.
[274:14.30]Pickles need to be soaked to become pickles.
[274:15.96]Yeah, but then take them out of the jar and you wrap them in paper towels and you squeeze, squish, crush, squish, crush, unwrap, and they're dry.
[274:22.07]Sure, they might have a couple of hairs on them, but you know you eat three inches of ass every year anyways for meals.
[274:31.54]Thank you, Rise Fall of Ziggy Stardust for the 10 bucks.
[274:35.70]Here's 10 great British pence in return.
[274:38.28]I ask, do you eat ass?
[274:39.96]Oh.
[274:44.35]um pretty good timing on me reading this but thank you for the 10 bucks I've answered it already thank you tish your boy for the five dollars can you check the subs you missed those people deserve acknowledgments for their uh their bravery yeah well if you if you're new I run a sub credits at the end of the stream
[275:09.95]Shows everybody's name on stream, on screen, that subbed during the stream.
[275:14.52]I've found it's a very, um, it's a good system, it seems.
[275:22.10]But thank you for the five dollars, Tisty Boy.
[275:25.61]Appreciate it.
[275:27.25]Pigeon, thanks for the $2.50.
[275:28.21]I'm happy to report that my profile on this community has received an A. You got a 94% on that paper.
[275:33.67]The professor marked me off for no quotes from you.
[275:38.77]I told you I'd use a quote.
[275:40.75]What did I say?
[275:41.23]Eat vegetables and shit?
[275:42.41]You could have just put it in there.
[275:45.53]You could have just put it at the very end.
[275:47.09]By the way, and leave a hyperlink to a clip of me saying, eat your vegetables, good luck on your paper.
[275:53.40]And he would have been like, what the fuck?
[275:59.76]Well, congrats on the paper.
[276:05.36]94%, you should be proud of that.
[276:06.84]It's a very good job.
[276:15.52]Appreciate the $250.
[276:17.44]And then we had TheCremator.
[276:18.84]Thanks for $3.
[276:19.50]You asked about games to play.
[276:20.47]What about Grand Theft Auto 2?
[276:22.57]It's free on Steam.
[276:25.93]GTA 2 is free on Steam?
[276:27.45]Is that true?
[276:35.04]Am I getting baited?
[276:39.12]Or is that actually real?
[276:46.25]Free?
[276:46.53]I don't know.
[276:52.65]It was free for some time now, really.
[276:55.91]You can't buy it.
[276:56.91]I don't know.
[277:00.64]I'm really drunk.
[277:04.60]Well, drink some water.
[277:07.94]Thank you for the three bucks.
[277:14.43]Appreciate it.
[277:16.25]Rise and fall of Stardust.
[277:18.27]Thanks for the $5.
[277:18.73]I don't know what this is.
[277:21.81]This looks like Morse code.
[277:26.74]I don't know what this is, but thank you for the $5 and thanks for the Morse code.
[277:34.84]It's not Morse code, though.
[277:36.16]It's something else.
[277:38.21]This actually might be the top portion of an ASCII art.
[277:44.26]that they maybe tried to put the whole thing in and it just auto-deleted everything because there's only a certain amount of characters you can put through to Streamlabs.
[277:52.30]Maybe.
[277:55.03]I don't know.
[277:55.79]It's hard to tell.
[277:57.49]But thank you for the $5.
[278:02.23]Thank you to 3BucksCremator again.
[278:04.19]I don't... I don't know if I... I'm not going to click on that link.
[278:11.39]I don't want to see what happened to your hand.
[278:12.99]Hopefully you're okay.
[278:20.03]Hopefully you're alright.
[278:21.75]Whatever happened to you.
[278:26.25]Hey, thank you Deus Morte for the $2.50.
[278:28.21]If you like Picross, there's a cool one on the DS called Picross 3D where you start with a cube and uncover an object within using the Picross number system.
[278:37.02]You might be interested.
[278:38.40]I think I owned that.
[278:40.52]I owned two Picross games for 3D.
[278:41.96]Yes.
[278:48.20]One of them was normal.
[278:49.08]The other one was a 3D one, if I remember.
[278:54.00]That's cool, though.
[278:54.54]Maybe I'll check that out.
[278:56.38]Might be cool to have for a stream.
[279:01.53]Hey, thank you, Dorkube, for the $2.50.
[279:03.13]Oh my god, we have a story to one-up the Oreos in Mom's bed.
[279:06.71]I don't even care that it was a dream.
[279:09.85]Yeah, but that's not...
[279:12.56]It wasn't a real story.
[279:13.98]It was me telling you a dream I had.
[279:15.98]That didn't happen.
[279:17.30]I actually threw up in my mother's bed.
[279:19.18]That is a real story, not a dream.
[279:26.67]Thank you, Alpha Librarian for the $2.50.
[279:28.29]Turns out you need to sign an ultimate gaming question sheet for the book.
[279:31.75]You can get the book for 20% off.
[279:36.55]No, it's all good, man.
[279:42.49]I don't need any books.
[279:43.63]I got plenty of them.
[279:44.45]I read a lot.
[279:46.41]12 books a month at the end of the year.
[279:49.88]Ferodium Weapon, again, $50.
[279:51.16]A lot of fucking money.
[279:56.20]A lot.
[279:59.16]DoorCube...
[280:03.22]Thanks for the $2.50.
[280:03.84]This may be an odd question, but I just listened to a podcast earlier that reminded me of the topic.
[280:09.45]Did you listen to Ska when you were younger?
[280:12.15]Ska.
[280:14.79]Um... Does the Mighty Mighty Boss Stones count?
[280:20.91]That's close.
[280:21.97]Kind of, but not really, right?
[280:27.63]Yes.
[280:28.27]I loved the Mighty Mighty Boss Stones.
[280:31.06]The Mighty Mighty Boston's were my favorite band when I was 14, 15.
[280:35.14]Maybe even a little younger, like 13.
[280:39.22]You look like a ska listener.
[280:41.10]What does that mean?
[280:47.00]I remember being on the bus to a field trip and listening to the whole CD twice because it was a long drive.
[280:54.18]I had Walkman with one of those discs.
[280:58.35]Disc players.
[280:59.11]It was great.
[281:08.93]And back then, the biggest technology was making sure that if you grabbed or moved the Walkman, that it didn't... That was a huge technology.
[281:19.55]Non-skippable discs would mean you could pick it up, you could put it in your pocket.
[281:24.11]If you went on a bump in the car, it didn't skip.
[281:28.47]It buffered.
[281:29.89]First, by the way, first ever form of buffering was CDs having the no skip feature.
[281:39.76]It would almost download and prepare, buffer you could even say, two or three seconds ahead.
[281:48.64]Somebody made a million dollars with that because then that turned into buffering.
[281:53.78]Fucking Bob Buffer.
[281:54.94]Nice job.
[282:00.37]But yeah, Muddy Muddy Boston.
[282:02.52]Hey, C4G, thanks for the $2.50.
[282:03.46]Hey, Jerma, do you have any VR games you'd most recommend from the ones you've played?
[282:07.66]Absolutely.
[282:08.78]I have Beat Saber and SUPERHOT, and they slap.
[282:12.26]Also, please say something really funny here so people clip it, so I can find this easily when I wake up tomorrow.
[282:17.07]Thank you.
[282:20.13]Want me to do the horn?
[282:25.21]Somebody will clip that.
[282:25.85]It's going to be like horn, and then you'll be... There it is.
[282:32.16]But, SUPERHOT VR is probably, I would say, in the top five for sure.
[282:38.08]Blade & Sorcery was really, really great.
[282:44.18]Pavlov is probably the best game that you can play for multiplayer, I think, at least what I've played so far.
[282:55.84]If you haven't played Blade & Sorcery, it's fantastic.
[282:59.34]Pavlov, again.
[283:04.56]Even like Climby.
[283:06.90]Climby was really fun too.
[283:08.02]It's very simple, but there's workshop support.
[283:16.60]But we'll see.
[283:17.04]Maybe my opinion changes tomorrow because there's another three or four games in VR I'm going to play tomorrow.
[283:23.82]We should have a great time.
[283:24.72]Looking forward to it.
[283:27.92]Oh, Dreadhalls.
[283:28.90]That's right.
[283:31.37]If you like horror games, Dreadhalls is probably the best one.
[283:35.61]For VR.
[283:37.09]Does not... Do you think there would be a shitload of them?
[283:43.12]Dreadhalls, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[283:44.56]Definitely.
[283:48.56]The bar fight game was funny, but it's really only like 30 to 40 minutes.
[283:55.97]You don't get like an entire experience.
[283:57.31]It's like a 25 minute experience to punch people in the face and throw chairs at people.
[284:02.49]Hot dogs.
[284:04.87]Hot dogs, horseshoes, and hand grenades.
[284:06.39]That's another good one.
[284:08.98]If you like simulated weaponry and a million different axes and there's like sniper rifles and like the range.
[284:18.04]There's all kinds of stuff in that game.
[284:22.99]Did I see the tweet by Twitch about Dreadhalls?
[284:25.03]I did, yeah.
[284:26.03]It's funny.
[284:28.99]It's funny.
[284:29.59]They bleeped out the swears and they cut me out.
[284:33.13]They're like, yeah, get this.
[284:34.10]We don't want his, like, big, ugly, gross body in here.
[284:37.20]We just want, like, the joke.
[284:45.22]Yeah, the official Twitch Twitter did a little nice little shout-out on their Twitter.
[284:52.89]It was really cool.
[284:57.09]It's pretty cool.
[285:01.11]But let's keep going.
[285:01.79]Almost done.
[285:03.19]We got just a little bit to go through.
[285:06.83]It's time for slime.
[285:07.65]Thanks for the three bucks.
[285:09.43]Hello, Jerma.
[285:09.93]Please activate that cool gamer loot in Stream Legends.
[285:14.56]We got it.
[285:21.08]What level is the guild?
[285:27.01]Have we taken over anything yet?
[285:35.83]Alright, you ready?
[285:36.29]I don't know if you have to have it open or not.
[285:39.16]Level 38.
[285:41.24]Alright.
[285:41.90]If you want it, get it open.
[285:43.52]I'm not sure if you... Maybe you have to have it open or not.
[285:46.00]3, 2, 1.
[285:48.22]There you go.
[285:52.93]Remind me to do that again tomorrow.
[285:56.79]Because if people are having fun with that and it's just some interesting little idle thing that they do for fun, then yeah, just always remind me to do that.
[286:09.47]But thank you to Sniper's Line.
[286:10.79]Hope you enjoy your free stuff.
[286:14.03]Hey, C4G, thanks for the $5 here.
[286:17.15]Also, Minecraft VR is honestly pretty good, as long as you liked Minecraft to begin with.
[286:22.50]The cows are too big, so they're kind of scary, and you get nauseous, like, really easy, so you know what I changed my mind.
[286:30.10]It sucks.
[286:34.88]Also, Hatsune Miku VR sucks, which is the same because I love Miku, but it's not worth $25.
[286:41.00]Okay, I'm out of bits.
[286:43.08]Bye.
[286:46.75]What is Hatsune Miku VR?
[286:53.09]Wait, isn't Hatsune Miku the pop star, the animated pop star thing?
[287:04.36]Oh, okay.
[287:05.26]Well, I'm sorry that you didn't think it was worth it.
[287:12.64]He doesn't know.
[287:13.50]I mean, I do.
[287:14.00]I just told you what it was.
[287:16.80]I just said what it is.
[287:20.42]Miko and Jerma collab when?
[287:22.34]I don't know.
[287:24.74]I don't do collabs.
[287:26.42]Organically, we'll hang out with somebody and maybe we'll do something together.
[287:33.31]He doesn't know.
[287:36.91]Get the Miku game.
[287:38.91]I don't think so.
[287:48.38]Thank you, uh... Genny Benny for the free bucks.
[287:51.86]Jeremy, you're telling me your SEGA is dead.
[287:53.76]He overheated.
[287:55.64]It's dead.
[287:56.12]No, it's... It's fine.
[288:00.34]That's the first Dreamcast game that I had a problem with.
[288:05.04]So I don't know.
[288:10.26]It was weird that the background wasn't there.
[288:12.82]Scenes were disappearing.
[288:14.44]Remember the game just locked up?
[288:17.21]That was really weird.
[288:19.23]They were just standing there and she was blinking?
[288:22.81]That was odd, but... Maybe it was a problem with the Dreamcast.
[288:27.46]I don't think so.
[288:29.04]Fucking bootleg.
[288:30.06]I can't believe it if that's true.
[288:34.69]I made such a big deal about opening that wrapper and shit.
[288:37.73]People are probably talking so much shit and laughing their ass off at the fact that I'm like, oh, look, in the wrapper, cool.
[288:44.84]It's like a bootleg fucking disc.
[288:52.14]What?
[288:52.70]An 80-year-old.
[288:58.45]We all get scammed once in a while.
[289:01.89]Thank you, PikaBanana, for the $10.31.
[289:03.09]That wasn't a boring stream.
[289:05.51]We're here for you, not the games.
[289:07.29]All the crazy games you play wouldn't be as fun to watch without you, jermaHeart.
[289:11.81]I really appreciate that.
[289:16.13]I do.
[289:19.25]But still, I want each stream to be fun.
[289:23.64]I want people to not go, oh, here we go again, or, whoa, this sucked.
[289:27.14]Oh, yeah, that was bad.
[289:29.34]Even if that's the case, I know I never want that to happen.
[289:33.62]I want each broadcast to be as good as the last one.
[289:36.72]As good as the one that was a week ago.
[289:37.98]As good as the one that was a month ago.
[289:39.18]And it's not... I'm not really... I'm fine.
[289:45.38]I had a blast.
[289:47.02]Things were fun.
[289:52.61]I wasn't upset or anything.
[289:53.59]It's not like I'm mad.
[289:55.97]It's just... You know what I want?
[289:59.17]I want it to go the way that I want it.
[290:01.13]And when it doesn't,
[290:03.28]It can be like... Like shit.
[290:08.95]Was the whole stream PictoCross?
[290:10.83]No.
[290:12.71]We only went to PictoCross.
[290:13.83]That's not even a Picross.
[290:16.81]Because of the technical problems I had with the Dreamcast.
[290:22.97]Kind of threw everything out of whack.
[290:26.92]But it's alright.
[290:28.32]We move on.
[290:29.00]We play it.
[290:29.46]We do it again tomorrow.
[290:31.30]I still had a lot of fun on this stream.
[290:33.85]I had fun on pretty much every stream.
[290:39.78]I had a lot of fun on the last stream.
[290:41.16]From yesterday, you know?
[290:42.20]It's... I don't... I'm not, like, giving points and taking points away per stream.
[290:47.84]Like, oh, that one was an 8.
[290:49.08]That one was an 8.
[290:50.00]That was a 7.
[290:50.78]That was a 2.
[290:51.22]No.
[290:53.56]I just... Want them to go well.
[290:57.18]Right?
[291:00.10]Modest Narcissus.
[291:01.78]Thanks for the $10...
[291:05.70]No, 10 community subs, not $10.
[291:07.26]What am I talking about?
[291:13.39]Thank you.
[291:14.65]For the community subs.
[291:23.49]Thank you, Genny Benny, for the $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10, $11 here.
[291:24.89]Hey, don't you think chat's annoying?
[291:31.96]Like that pianist.
[291:33.62]You're right.
[291:34.20]Let's get some rock music in here.
[291:44.49]How could you say something like that?
[291:47.89]Jeremiah, it's illegal to download music and movies off the internet.
[291:51.61]I'm going to go to internet jail.
[291:54.49]It's not illegal to listen to music on official VEVO YouTube account.
[292:06.88]You wouldn't download a car.
[292:11.53]Thank you, Ciroc, for the 250.
[292:12.81]When you die, science will preserve your brain and will harvest all your unused video and stream ideas.
[292:18.89]Also, Joel streamed 3D Movie Maker five days ago and he got Sans to be in it.
[292:29.14]That's a wonderful program.
[292:31.30]I hope he had a lot of fun.
[292:38.21]That program can be hell to get to run stably at like 800 by 600.
[292:43.43]Hopefully he got it to work pretty well.
[292:49.84]But it's a blast if you can get it to work.
[292:56.28]Sans confirmed for Rat Movie 3.
[293:00.46]Something around the thanks for the free bucks.
[293:01.62]Hey Germs, Grandma found out I had her credit card.
[293:03.89]I gotta get out of here.
[293:04.57]I gotta go.
[293:05.79]Don't use, don't do that.
[293:08.55]I know you're fucking around.
[293:10.89]But don't, like, don't... What are you thinking?
[293:14.92]Are you fucking... Are you serious?
[293:16.88]Don't do that shit.
[293:21.80]Sorry.
[293:23.20]Say sorry!
[293:31.03]Sorry.
[293:32.37]Freudian weapon.
[293:32.99]Thanks for the $5, Freudian.
[293:34.09]Random thought, but your old 500 subscriber video really helps me power through my workouts.
[293:38.81]It's the same kind of energy I try to have at the gym.
[293:41.83]Yeah.
[293:44.45]I used to love working out.
[293:51.31]I miss those days sometimes, but I'm kind of a mess if I'm honest.
[293:59.75]I get, like, sore really easily now.
[294:01.99]It just sucks.
[294:04.25]But it's alright.
[294:09.37]Same energy.
[294:15.05]I forget that... It was almost eight years ago.
[294:19.36]No, that was eight years ago.
[294:22.36]I made my first YouTube videos just, like, fucking stacked.
[294:29.04]Almost ten years has gone by.
[294:37.66]It's a long time.
[294:39.92]And I'm just happy to still be here.
[294:41.69]I'm happy that eight years later... There's... I still... You know, people still think this is interesting.
[294:50.57]I still think this is interesting.
[294:53.60]Holy shit, it took me forever to focus on anything.
[294:57.12]Eight years?
[295:01.06]I could barely keep my shoes tied for eight years.
[295:10.24]But... Thank you.
[295:15.10]I do miss those old workouts, though.
[295:16.88]They were a lot of fun.
[295:19.18]Tingy, thanks for the $2.50.
[295:19.96]Hey, Jermbo, I don't know if you're away, but Twitch allows custom cheer modes.
[295:25.67]I think we can see some custom chair modes related to the channel.
[295:29.06]Maybe animated jermaChomp or OG Jerm doing the same.
[295:32.96]Hope you consider this.
[295:34.14]I'd love to see it.
[295:34.72]I'm sure Chat would too.
[295:37.49]Yeah, actually, I gotta get in touch with Floridal.
[295:40.67]Because there are a bunch of random things that I'm gonna add to the channel.
[295:45.20]We talked about it a little bit last week.
[295:48.72]There will be animated cheerboats, there will be new screens, there will be some new music, there will be some new animations.
[295:57.26]It's been long enough, I think it's time to do some more.
[296:00.90]Maybe some more emotes too, to fill up some slots.
[296:07.26]I'll be getting in contact with him very soon.
[296:21.84]There's another Vroom.
[296:29.71]Another Vroom.
[296:32.65]There they go.
[296:37.97]There they go!
[296:39.17]A Vroom emote?
[296:44.59]That's not a bad idea.
[296:47.57]I feel... I don't know, though.
[296:48.45]I feel like...
[296:50.56]Do you think that would get tiring after a while?
[296:54.90]It might.
[296:55.68]It might be a next situation where it just... cars.
[296:59.44]I don't know.
[297:02.06]That's a tough one.
[297:14.99]Uh, thank you PaulinShirt for the five dollars.
[297:19.04]Jeremy, I made a gamer test for you.
[297:21.60]Do it on stream.
[297:24.43]Uh, this is a random link here.
[297:28.13]This is something that I want to make sure everyone's aware.
[297:30.35]I don't click random links in BitDonations.
[297:37.04]If it's an Imgur link, if it's a YouTube link, that's fine.
[297:41.14]But I don't just click random links.
[297:43.50]Unless, uh... You gotta be careful.
[297:46.97]And... Dermot lied about Minecraft VR.
[297:53.55]Is... You're gonna have to change that username tomorrow.
[298:00.66]But thank you for the five community subs.
[298:07.95]Discord image links too.
[298:09.17]Yeah, those are fine.
[298:12.79]But if you have a link that's not one of those places, here's what's probably going to have to happen.
[298:24.40]I'm probably going to have to get them screened by a mod or something to make sure that it's whatever it is and that they can tell me about it later as I'm in the end here.
[298:36.51]Because I really just can't click on random stuff.
[298:42.28]Somebody- A person- No.
[298:44.30]A person to taste the food before the king eats it?
[298:49.18]But really, though.
[298:53.55]Oh, he dropped dead.
[298:54.77]I'm not eating that meat pie.
[298:58.78]What if a mod betrays you?
[299:00.42]Long story short, if it's not Imgur, YouTube, Discord, or something that I know exactly what it is from the link hyperlink itself, I'm not going to click it.
[299:14.77]I'm probably going to put that in the rules, too.
[299:21.73]I've got to be careful.
[299:22.39]I've got to take care of myself.
[299:25.66]But thank you for the $5.
[299:30.89]And while some links might not look malicious, I'm not saying this one is.
[299:36.25]You never know.
[299:36.67]You just gotta be careful.
[299:41.68]Notavirus.gov.
[299:47.30]I do appreciate anything that anybody makes.
[299:50.46]But we're probably gonna have to do a system where links get sort of pre-screened.
[299:57.96]Because I feel like I have missed things people have sent me because I didn't want to click it.
[300:01.26]Because I was like, I don't know what this is.
[300:03.04]I'm going to get a system in place.
[300:08.98]But thank you for the $5.
[300:10.13]Thank you.
[300:13.11]Don't click.
[300:13.61]It's a gnome.
[300:22.05]Don't click.
[300:22.71]It's a gnome.
[300:31.57]But that was right, Dai gave 200 bucks right there too, like 40 minutes ago.
[300:47.98]Pasta's almost ready!
[300:49.72]That's from... Kim!
[300:53.26]Oh shit.
[300:54.12]Boys and girls, pasta!
[300:58.45]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[300:59.31]I gotta go.
[300:59.69]I gotta get out of here.
[301:00.23]I gotta get out.
[301:03.50]It has been like eight hours, huh?
[301:04.70]I haven't eaten.
[301:06.20]Shit.
[301:06.68]Alright.
[301:06.98]Well, thank you to Dai for the 200 bucks.
[301:11.37]I'll be spending that on pasta.
[301:12.85]Guaranteed.
[301:13.99]Freudian Weapon, thanks for the 250.
[301:15.11]Wow, it's not often I can stick around for live bits.
[301:17.61]I usually just listen to the VOD with my morning coffee.
[301:20.87]Have a good night.
[301:21.37]I'll see you tomorrow.
[301:23.46]See you tomorrow.
[301:25.66]Thanks for hanging out.
[301:29.05]It's interesting that you watch the VODs with coffee in the morning.
[301:31.61]That's cool.
[301:33.27]It's an interesting way to do it.
[301:38.41]A Jewish bro.
[301:39.29]Thanks for three bucks.
[301:40.69]I ordered a door cube and all I got was a bunch of rusty razor blades and a lit cigarette.
[301:45.67]And is streaming your only job or does Kim work too?
[301:48.79]Also, Rat Movie 3 or Riot?
[301:52.85]Kim also works.
[301:57.34]Kim has a job.
[302:02.75]Tomorrow is my birthday?
[302:04.55]No, your tomorrow is my today.
[302:05.93]I don't know why I thought that.
[302:07.15]You said that.
[302:12.45]But on top of streaming, I also do construction.
[302:17.64]So a lot of the bridges and buildings and department buildings and stuff, I design them.
[302:31.86]And then I build them.
[302:34.32]By myself.
[302:37.68]In less than two weeks.
[302:47.89]Yo, this guy is a professional liar.
[302:52.91]I should play a fucking game.
[302:55.57]Where I just don't say anything true the whole stream and then people have to figure out what is a lie and what's not.
[303:02.93]Let's do that.
[303:03.57]That sounds like fun.
[303:05.25]Have a way for chat to get involved.
[303:08.76]And I'll just say a bunch of dog shit all stream.
[303:12.80]It's just the reverse lie detector.
[303:14.88]That's every stream.
[303:20.34]Almu, thanks for the 10 bucks, Almu.
[303:22.96]Oh god, oh god, Jerma, I'm sorry, but I can't pay the protection this month.
[303:26.56]Oh shit, please.
[303:27.60]This is all I have.
[303:29.72]Don't, I can't afford to lose.
[303:32.32]You almost got me to say that.
[303:34.61]Thanks for the 10 bucks, though, Almu.
[303:37.69]Thank you.
[303:38.23]Hey, Bobo!
[303:39.57]Bobobo!
[303:40.57]Thank you, Bobobobe!
[303:42.59]For the 10 bucks.
[303:43.67]No message, 10 dollars from Bobobobe.
[303:49.76]Thank you, Wreckersd.
[303:52.28]Wreckersd for the 10 bucks.
[303:53.52]Jerma, I tried to send this three times, but it was very silly.
[303:57.45]Chat, help me make sure I got it sent this right this time.
[304:01.13]So shout out to the wonderful boys here.
[304:03.97]Love you and enjoy the holidays, Dad.
[304:06.71]Thank you so much for the 10 bucks, Wreckersd.
[304:11.97]Incredibly generous amount of money to give me.
[304:13.70]Thank you.
[304:14.48]Glad you figured it out.
[304:15.66]Thank you.
[304:19.48]and thank you the cremator for the eight bucks Jerma uh it's from a flamethrower with the spray and lighter oh well don't don't do that you gotta be careful don't do that
[304:50.29]don't play with that kind of stuff go open up Gary's mod what are you thinking be careful that's very very much something you should not be doing
[305:21.67]But thank you.
[305:23.37]For the eight bucks.
[305:24.85]Take care of yourself.
[305:25.41]Be fucking careful.
[305:31.98]Hey, Bobobob!
[305:32.98]Thanks for the ten bucks.
[305:33.82]Hey, Jerm, I've been a fan of your content since the Grandpa Face reveal.
[305:36.78]That's a long time ago.
[305:38.92]Can't tell you how many times you've made my day by watching one of your videos.
[305:42.57]You've helped me through so much over the years.
[305:44.17]I want to give you a personal thank you for all that you've done.
[305:48.43]Well, Bobobob,
[305:51.91]I actually think it might be Bobo Bob.
[305:54.95]99.
[305:56.51]That's $20 here from me.
[305:58.15]That's more than I could ever, ever expect somebody to pay me for any reason.
[306:03.53]And that grandpa face reveal, I do remember making that.
[306:08.37]That was a fun one to make.
[306:10.27]Thank you so much for sticking around for like fucking seven years.
[306:13.01]That's a long ass time.
[306:15.70]Thank you.
[306:33.99]Grandpa is dead.
[306:35.37]No, grandpa is in hell.
[306:40.27]So, um, you know, whatever.
[306:46.56]Okay.
[306:48.14]So what does that mean exactly?
[306:54.30]Right.
[306:56.57]You know the lore.
[306:57.35]I don't need to explain it.
[306:59.59]Jess, you got it!
[307:00.47]Thanks for the 250.
[307:01.38]Making a full song on stream would be really cool.
[307:04.24]You could use your beatboxing ability.
[307:05.66]Joel did one before with Beefzone called Pigeon Techno.
[307:10.14]I still want to do... I still want to do that Fruity Loops stream.
[307:18.36]I want to get people to actually play instruments, though.
[307:20.48]There's too many.
[307:23.42]I gotta focus on one of these ideas.
[307:24.70]There's too many of them.
[307:30.08]There is something in particular that is gonna... It's summertime.
[307:33.97]It has to be nicer out.
[307:36.95]One of the main things that I've been wanting to do for a long time cannot be done until it is a higher temperature.
[307:43.07]It's getting there real soon.
[307:46.03]You're just gonna see it one day.
[307:48.43]I'm not gonna talk about it.
[307:49.47]It's just gonna happen.
[307:55.27]Garfield the Monday Killer, thank you for the 250.
[307:57.35]Jerma, it's Garf.
[307:58.89]I just got out of Captain Marvel.
[308:00.93]What a movie that was.
[308:02.66]It had a funny orange cat in it.
[308:04.74]Fun fact, Goose the Cat was played by four different cats, two of which are named after Muppets, Gonzo and Rizzo.
[308:10.98]Ain't that sweet?
[308:12.34]Nice to see some cat representation in mainstream media, other than The Secret Life of Pets and yours truly.
[308:18.53]Um...
[308:20.19]Okay.
[308:20.87]Captain Marvel, more like Cat-tan Marvel.
[308:23.71]Thank you, thank you.
[308:24.41]Chat is just loving that one.
[308:26.05]Chat, more like Cat-zing.
[308:28.77]That's thanks.
[308:29.40]I will be here all week.
[308:37.96]Is Shazam any good?
[308:39.80]Is that out yet?
[308:40.28]Because that's the other Captain Marvel.
[308:44.01]I'm going to go see Captain Marvel.
[308:45.01]I'm going to go see the other Captain Marvel, Shazam.
[308:48.87]I'm going to see them both, and then we'll see what... It's out.
[308:51.59]No, it's not.
[308:52.87]You just did the smiley face, like the I'm lying face.
[308:59.45]Early April looks pretty good.
[309:05.27]Yeah, it looks wholesome.
[309:07.39]Let's put it that way.
[309:11.81]Thank you, Garfield Book.
[309:15.73]Thank you to Matt's friend for $30.
[309:17.43]Hey, Jerma, it's my birthday this Sunday.
[309:19.71]Can you sing me happy birthday?
[309:20.73]How about I just say happy birthday?
[309:24.46]March 17th.
[309:25.80]Have a good birthday.
[309:30.50]Have a fantastic birthday, bash.
[309:35.00]Thank you for the $30.
[309:35.72]It's a lot of money.
[309:39.52]Heal's birthday, man.
[309:43.36]Cake and ice cream is on its way.
[309:49.35]thank you alf the librarian for three dollars but Jerma my books are 20 off you can have a 90 off buy one of my fantastic books my library has retro and new books even fan made books rats books where do you live that you have all these books

[310:17.11]I get it.
[310:18.25]It's another character.
[310:25.54]Why do we have like, five different role-playing characters here?
[310:33.02]Now I'm starting to get it.
[310:36.36]Every stream there's like a new character.
[310:46.37]It's part of the universe of God.
[310:57.75]Uh, but thank you.
[311:02.51]Uh, thank you to Hike0 for the 250.
[311:04.95]Here is my Rat Movie 3 song.
[311:07.11]I can't wait to watch the full-length feature film.
[311:13.74]Did you already put this together?
[311:24.55]Did somebody already do this?
[311:26.11]You already did this.
[311:28.91]Let me get it in here.
[311:49.47]Why can't I get this to play?
[312:06.61]Uh, hold on.
[312:16.30]It worked for me.
[312:17.00]Hold on, let me see if I can... Oh, now that's why.
[312:22.37]Okay, I got it.
[312:22.73]Alright, here we go.
[312:26.53]Let's hear it.
[313:27.15]Something like that.
[313:29.06]Something like that.
[313:33.38]Thank you for that.
[313:33.84]That was fucking awesome.
[313:39.81]That was what was in mind.
[313:42.77]There may have been some lyrics in the middle to add some flavor.
[313:50.39]But thank you, Hike Zero.
[313:51.22]That was fucking, that was great.
[313:52.58]Thank you so much.
[313:57.13]Uh, thank you nickname Jack for the three bucks.
[313:59.24]Decided to join a random TF2 game while you're talking to virtual fish.
[314:02.68]Someone recognizes my name as a reference and just asks, did you see the fish called Jerma a virgin?
[314:09.20]And you know what?
[314:09.94]I did.
[314:10.30]Absolute gold.
[314:14.65]Link, link, link, link, link.
[314:17.31]Here is the link to the rat song.
[314:21.93]That was carefully crafted.
[314:23.88]Uh...
[314:26.81]That's fucking hilarious.
[314:28.15]Thank you, NicknameJack.
[314:33.53]And then finally, let's run the credits.
[314:36.43]While we do, there's one or two more here.
[314:39.29]Credits, there they are.
[314:41.98]Here come all the subs.
[314:43.10]All the resubs on the new subs.
[314:49.58]You guys continue to keep the wheels spinning on this stream.
[314:52.82]And then some.
[314:56.69]Thank you, everybody.
[314:57.33]We had the librarian came back in for $5.
[315:06.11]We can give you our books for free.
[315:11.08]I don't need free.
[315:11.66]I don't need a free book.
[315:13.06]I want to come in there and I want to rent it like a blockbuster.
[315:15.46]I want to go in there and I want to bring that book back in three days or I have to forget about it and then my parents get a bill in the mail for $268 four and a half months later.
[315:31.14]That's what I want.
[315:38.70]Thank you, Cremator, for the $5.
[315:39.74]Video game flamethrower isn't as fun.
[315:45.17]But it's safe.
[315:46.57]And it's not going to hurt you.
[315:53.01]Then wait for the library to go out of business and never pay the fee.
[315:58.10]I don't remember.
[315:59.08]Did you?
[316:00.58]They used to probably go to collections.
[316:03.46]Right?
[316:05.52]Did they do that back then?
[316:06.66]I don't remember.
[316:12.83]If you didn't pay for months and months and months or a year, did Blockbuster ever send your bill to collections?
[316:24.43]I don't know.
[316:28.57]If you don't turn up for a year, they would erase it.
[316:32.73]Wow.
[316:37.38]That's kind of ridiculous.
[316:38.24]I mean, I guess how would they be able to keep track of that?
[316:41.86]They would have to be sending so many people to collections.
[316:44.96]That's why they went out of business.
[316:50.31]Oh, hey!
[316:51.55]Genny, Benny, thanks for the five bucks.
[316:52.83]Stream is over.
[316:53.49]That sucks.
[316:54.71]Am I gonna read the TF2 comics?
[316:57.77]I've read them all when they originally came out.
[317:00.81]This hasn't been a new TF2 comic in like a couple of years, right?
[317:04.36]At least a year.
[317:19.42]Will you be covering Pokémon Spear and Bow when it comes out?
[317:24.19]Probably not.
[317:28.17]I don't really play Pokémon.
[317:37.79]Finally, Cremator.
[317:38.65]Last bits.
[317:39.13]I'll take your word for it.
[317:40.14]You should try it and feel your eyes melt.
[317:43.02]It's... No.
[317:45.38]No, I'm not going to do that.
[317:46.92]I'm not going to do that.
[317:49.10]They say, but don't worry.
[317:49.94]My hand's been through worse.
[317:56.72]Take care of yourself.
[317:58.56]It's not worth it.
[318:03.53]Well, you won't be covering them because they're not real.
[318:06.79]Oh.
[318:10.57]It's not real.
[318:16.65]I can't stop hearing the new rat song.
[318:26.65]Alright, guys.
[318:27.21]I'm, uh, I'm beat.
[318:29.35]I will see you tomorrow for VR.
[318:34.05]Get some sleep.
[318:34.86]Thanks for sticking around, everybody.
[318:38.92]I'm gonna go eat some pasta.
[318:43.26]Photos!
[318:43.74]Thanks for $2.50.
[318:44.66]Ah, messing this up.
[318:45.54]Sorry.
[318:45.84]Have a good night.
[318:48.50]Uh, looks like you got it.
[318:50.60]Thank you so much, Photos.
[318:51.92]Uh, Photo S. Photos for the $2.50.
[318:56.11]I will see you tomorrow for Minecraft VR.
[319:00.13]And some other stuff.
[319:01.31]Have a great night, guys.
[319:05.83]Goodbye.
