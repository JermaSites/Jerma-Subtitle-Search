[00:06.33]Jeremy?
[00:07.93]How are you?
[00:10.11]Welcome back to Virtual Reality with Jeremy985.
[00:12.67]We're going to begin today with Space Channel 5.
[00:21.54]Sorry I wasn't here yesterday.
[00:24.20]I think I severely underestimated how much pain I was going to be in yesterday.
[00:29.69]I woke up and I turned till I get out of bed.
[00:34.03]It was like...
[00:36.38]the best way to describe pain especially turning pain those of you guys that have like rotational pain that's a perfect that's a perfect noise for it it sucks but I'm good I'm here I'm not oh my god it's just I fell over these cords I swear to god I I'm not even on camera and I almost just fell down I'm not I didn't even do anything
[01:02.70]I'm not taking the brace off today.
[01:04.74]Don't let me do that.
[01:05.62]It doesn't matter how much of a sweaty bastard I am.
[01:07.70]Don't let me take this thing off.
[01:10.26]It is doing something very important.
[01:12.40]It's over.
[01:13.94]I'm doing a Doug Funny right now.
[01:16.26]I'm wearing it over my clothes.
[01:18.34]Doug Funny used to wear his underwear over his clothes as that superhero.
[01:22.60]Quail Man.
[01:24.30]Just think of it like that.
[01:27.96]Health Healing Curse.
[01:31.28]If it works, then do it.
[01:33.74]You know what, can we collectively, I'm serious, let's do this.
[01:38.28]I'm gonna get on camera and we're gonna collectively fucking have like a healing session.
[01:43.20]Can we do that?
[01:44.78]You have to imagine, if like five to 10,000 people all collectively think the same thing at the same time, will that work?
[01:54.66]Like, the neurons and the weird simulation that we're probably living in.
[01:57.46]Will the data get processed?
[01:59.60]Will my pain go away tomorrow?
[02:03.56]Let's try it.
[02:05.60]Give me the healing.
[02:07.44]What's the curse part, though?
[02:09.66]Hold on a second.
[02:10.32]Let me just get my never-ending supply of fucking White Claw.
[02:18.01]Yeah, I'm doing it today.
[02:21.17]Just a little.
[02:23.70]This is how you summon... What?
[02:27.62]No, don't call it a healing curse.
[02:29.28]Call it like a healing potion.
[02:31.50]And we have to go over some things too.
[02:32.84]Because there are people that think I'm like four feet tall.
[02:35.92]This is really important.
[02:37.18]We have to... Okay, let me just put the cam on.
[02:44.83]See?
[02:46.17]Okay.
[02:47.07]I moved the camera a little bit because... Can you hear me?
[02:49.23]I hope you can.
[02:51.19]Alright.
[02:53.64]First of all, I got the fucking championship belt on.
[02:57.63]I didn't texture it yet.
[03:00.41]I feel like a fucking videographer.
[03:02.05]This is just giving me flashbacks.
[03:04.55]Okay, get the groom, get the groom.
[03:07.73]All right, so listen to me.
[03:08.53]This is important.
[03:10.05]This, this is not a window, okay?
[03:16.00]It's a blanket.
[03:16.78]I hung on the wall because it's so echoey in here.
[03:20.54]I had to put up something to absorb the sound.
[03:23.39]Understand?
[03:24.71]That's not a window.
[03:28.15]Second of all, this base station is 6'3".
[03:34.64]This is, I measured it.
[03:35.60]It's 6'3".
[03:37.72]Do you see that?
[03:39.26]It's like 6'4".
[03:42.46]I don't know why everything looks so tiny on this camera in this room.
[03:46.28]Like, look, ready?
[03:51.76]I look, like, fucking minuscule.
[03:54.87]I don't know why.
[03:55.63]You know what it looks like?
[03:58.43]Have you ever seen those, um... Okay.
[04:01.67]You know those optical illusions where it's, like, the huge guy is standing here and there's, like, a tiny little person in the corner?
[04:07.87]And it's just like, whoa, oh my god, this is... And they're in a room and the furniture looks all weird.
[04:13.80]Like, it's because the room is, like, 50 feet long and it's, like, slanted.
[04:18.33]That's what's going on here.
[04:19.57]Because look it.
[04:21.29]I'm a normal person.
[04:22.97]But when I go back here, I don't know why.
[04:24.97]I don't understand.
[04:28.94]It looks so bizarre.
[04:29.86]Whatever.
[04:32.32]That's not a window.
[04:33.24]I'm 5'8".
[04:33.86]Get over it!
[04:49.11]I wanted that to be so loud.
[04:53.91]You got a short neck?
[05:00.23]I don't have a short neck.
[05:02.67]That's such a fucking insult.
[05:04.41]I don't know why.
[05:05.03]You know, oh, hey, you're a fat guy.
[05:09.95]Oh, you're stupid.
[05:11.89]Your neck is too short.
[05:14.31]That, fuck, that like hurts.
[05:17.35]Hold on a second.
[05:22.13]You got anything to say?
[05:23.07]You got anything to say to the camera?
[05:24.63]Go on, say it.
[05:25.23]All right.
[05:34.07]We're going to play.
[05:39.07]We are going to play Face Channel 5, Virtual Reality Edition.
[05:45.33]I've been waiting for this.
[05:45.99]It's not a monster zero.
[05:52.29]That's got to look like a monster.
[05:55.03]All right.
[05:55.31]All right, fuck it.
[05:56.33]We're going.
[05:57.81]I'm going in the headset now.
[05:59.73]I can't hear you.
[06:01.29]I'll be able to in a second.
[06:03.75]Are we ready?
[06:04.69]We good?
[06:08.17]What about the camera?
[06:11.26]He's too small.
[06:11.96]No, no, stop.
[06:18.90]We love your corset.
[06:25.63]Are you underage drinking?
[06:29.23]Yeah, yeah, I'm 17, guys.
[06:32.79]Oh, no, you caught me.
[06:35.53]I turned 17 last month.
[06:40.64]All right, let's fucking go.
[06:41.76]I'm going.
[06:42.20]Wait, let me get one more sip.
[06:48.18]Are you underage drinking?
[06:51.68]I like that one, actually.
[06:57.72]All right.
[06:58.94]Hey.
[07:00.88]Uh, Morty.
[07:02.48]By the way, I can use that reference because we're going to be playing that game probably today.
[07:08.56]Where's the audio?
[07:11.76]All right, make sure I'm comfortable.
[07:18.07]All right, let me get in.
[07:20.07]Audio is in a good spot.
[07:21.81]Let's clunk myself in here.
[07:23.17]Space Channel 5.
[07:28.32]Hey.
[07:32.14]Oh, I just burped and my nose burned.
[07:33.64]All right, that looks good.
[07:36.56]Where are the controllers?
[07:41.01]What a substance that you don't want to put in your body.
[07:45.61]Can you imagine like burping?
[07:49.61]No controllers are connected.
[07:50.71]What?
[07:50.81]What are you talking about?
[07:54.88]Did I take too long?
[07:57.30]Might be too loud.
[07:58.33]We'll find out.
[08:00.43]Oh, there you are.
[08:03.93]Acid sneeze.
[08:06.79]Say happy birthday to Catboy.
[08:08.19]Happy birthday, Catboy!
[08:09.33]Alright, I don't think this really matters too much, but I want to do the story.
[08:15.13]How's the audio?
[08:15.71]Are we clean?
[08:16.43]Do we sound clean?
[08:21.42]20 subs and he's going to miss?
[08:22.46]Who's going to give the subs?
[08:24.38]Thanks for the 20 subs.
[08:27.18]Thanks for the subs.
[08:29.46]Oh, I got some subs.
[08:30.20]Got some subs.
[08:30.80]Oh, I got some subs.
[08:31.38]All right, it's good.
[08:33.38]Let's do it.
[08:33.78]Story mode.
[08:34.30]I'm ready.
[08:38.84]Story.
[08:39.80]Tutorial.
[08:41.81]Oh, we're going to do another tutorial.
[08:43.75]By the way, I found out why I didn't like Boneworks.
[08:45.67]I'll explain later.
[08:46.79]If we don't put a stop to this, all the groove moxie across the entire...
[08:54.45]What just happened?
[08:56.45]I almost just puked.
[08:59.97]What happened?
[09:05.37]What?
[09:05.67]I thought I passed out.
[09:06.94]Why is it doing this?
[09:08.68]Why am I going dark?
[09:09.48]Okay, does it start the next chapter?
[09:13.36]Why is it doing that?
[09:28.08]Since you're new here, let's start you off with some orientation.
[09:31.82]If you want to become an ace dancing reporter, you're going to need to master the basics first.
[09:37.37]Fortunately, we've got veteran reporter Ulala here to guide you.
[09:40.97]Oh, Ulala!
[09:42.05]First off, we'll need to get you scanned so you can come inside.
[09:45.87]Place your hands out in front.
[09:47.27]Why is this... Hand placement confirmed.
[09:55.58]Okay.
[09:56.84]All right, energy stream.
[09:58.54]You got it!
[10:00.82]Initializing costume fitting.
[10:09.72]Costume fitting complete.
[10:11.86]Identification verified.
[10:13.84]Let's head to the studio.
[10:15.04]Wait, am I Ulala?
[10:22.10]I feel like I do have a short neck.
[10:23.67]Do they know?
[10:31.29]Where are we?
[10:36.54]Oh.
[10:39.02]Yeah!
[10:40.54]What happened?
[10:41.22]Change log?
[10:42.10]No, get that off.
[10:43.66]What did I do?
[10:44.00]I don't want to see the change log.
[10:45.68]What happened?
[10:48.65]We're good.
[10:54.38]Oh my god, I'm a huge fan!
[10:55.74]Memorize your partner's moves and then dance them right back.
[10:59.12]She goes like this.
[11:00.58]Ow.
[11:00.68]Okay.
[11:28.59]Don't put your hand in there!
[11:30.13]Don't put your hand in there!
[11:41.82]The legs not moving look weird.
[11:43.48]Okay.
[12:00.10]I feel like this is the person in the back row in the workout video that's not doing it very well.
[12:05.40]You know, they're like... It's like, that's why they get put back there.
[12:14.41]Alright, now let's meet the person in the front of the video.
[12:16.81]Uh-oh.
[12:25.72]scoffs I can't wait oh hi energy stream
[12:55.64]I didn't really pay that much attention to any of that.

[13:09.51]Here we go!

[31:47.86]This thing!
[31:49.66]Minus two.
[31:59.52]However, I am not yet sated.
[32:05.08]Uh, okay.
[32:07.64]Let's see.
[32:09.32]You can call me Glitter.
[32:11.34]Throw up a barrier.
[32:14.12]Glitter.
[32:15.86]Gonna consume all your Groove Moxie.
[32:19.12]Yabba-dabba-doo, yabba-dabba-doo-dee.
[32:20.44]Barrier.
[32:20.88]I'll help myself to all the Groove Moxie the galaxy has to offer.
[32:26.00]We've seen you solve this dilemma.
[32:40.68]Period.
[32:42.83]I would get sick from that.
[33:11.19]I'm gonna put it in my mouth and scream.
[33:16.68]What was it?
[33:37.46]And he's insane.
[33:38.44]I'm not.
[33:38.82]I'm normal.
[33:39.70]Who's that?
[34:06.09]Hey, I'm... What about me?
[34:10.45]Got him!
[34:39.62]We gotta save Ulala!
[34:47.71]Are we ready?
[34:52.77]Alright, RUSH HIM!
[35:04.68]Hundred!
[35:06.10]Wait!
[35:06.28]This is the villain redemption arc!
[35:09.38]Here!
[35:09.56]Have it back!
[35:09.94]You can have it back.
[35:33.02]Take it back.
[35:33.52]That's my redemption arc.
[35:35.52]Take it back.
[35:36.76]Here.
[35:37.74]I don't want to go to hell.
[35:38.70]Just take it.
[35:39.46]This gets me into heaven.
[35:40.86]My god redeems, right?
[35:41.36]Come on.
[35:41.62]Take it.
[35:42.14]I want to go.
[35:42.72]I want to get to heaven.
[35:43.72]Oops.
[35:44.91]I can't be coming back for seconds.
[35:45.63]Get ready.
[35:47.11]Things are about to get heavy.
[35:55.44]Let's dance.
[35:56.10]Time to dig in.
[35:56.96]Yeah.
[35:57.08]Dance.
[35:57.64]No.
[36:02.05]Why are we shooting there?
[36:06.09]This is kind of weird.
[36:11.79]In my stomach.
[36:32.63]What the fuck?
[36:34.76]Alright.
[36:43.64]Watch out!
[36:47.11]What's that called?
[36:48.65]Fuck.
[36:49.65]Oh, shit!
[36:50.73]What?
[37:01.17]Why was I not paying attention?
[37:05.49]What?
[37:09.08]My arms are too fucked up.
[37:25.29]Let's channel the Groove Moxie of all 500 million something in attendance to us and funnel it into one FUNCTASTIC FORM!
[37:35.52]I'm sorry.
[37:37.00]I'm sorry.
[37:38.24]I'm sorry.
[37:40.60]I'm sorry.
[37:41.32]I'm sorry.
[37:41.74]I'm sorry.
[37:42.80]I'm sorry.
[37:45.44]I'm sorry.
[37:50.44]I'm sorry.
[37:52.28]Oh, what's the big deal?
[37:53.82]I just won the meal.
[37:55.34]Did I get it?
[37:56.98]Two, two, two.
[37:59.54]Now!
[38:00.90]Two, two, two.
[38:04.34]Literally drop.
[38:05.17]Oh, no.
[38:05.63]Oh, my God.
[38:06.87]Jesus.
[38:07.39]Oh, this was truly the final piece.
[38:22.12]Wait.
[38:27.02]Can I stand here?
[38:28.62]I think I did a lot of work.
[38:31.70]I almost missed that one.
[38:54.01]What the fuck?
[38:54.73]Don't touch me.
[38:55.31]Hey.
[38:58.11]What was that?
[39:06.40]Well, I don't want to turn... I want to... I don't know what they're doing.
[39:19.69]You didn't let me choreograph this with me.
[39:21.43]I wasn't here at the rehearsal.
[39:23.39]Oh, fucking whatever.
[39:54.44]Alright, I'm tired.
[39:55.22]I'm done.
[39:57.98]I'm done.
[40:00.10]I'm gonna walk off the stage.
[40:01.51]That was fun.
[40:26.82]It's your moment.
[40:31.98]That's it?
[40:34.40]I guess so.
[40:41.69]That was pretty cool.
[40:47.05]How long did that take?
[40:52.34]40 minutes?
[40:53.78]Wait, wait, wait.
[40:57.88]Dance.
[40:58.92]Pudding.
[41:00.48]Eh.
[41:26.82]Was that a drug handoff?
[41:30.43]Thanks for the coke!
[41:33.71]Put that in here, and then we continue to move like we were supposed to be here.
[41:47.53]You're an enemy!
[41:48.48]Oh.
[41:49.48]Sorry, we just got shocked.
[41:52.61]It's like, oh, ow, sorry.
[41:54.63]Are you okay?
[41:55.17]Yeah, I got me too.
[41:55.97]Did you see the blue line?
[41:57.17]Did you see the blue line?
[41:58.11]Oh my God, it was fucking crazy.
[41:59.83]Hello?
[42:00.07]Fuse here.
[42:00.85]Anybody home?
[42:02.61]I'm out in another galaxy at the moment, but I caught the broadcast.
[42:06.26]That new team looked fabulous.
[42:10.52]What's going on, Mr. Fuse?
[42:12.12]Everybody's waiting for you.
[42:13.12]It's like a Marvel post-credits scene.
[42:14.72]Fuse, you coming?
[42:17.50]I'll be there in two shakes.
[42:20.65]And here we are with Celebrity Deathmatch.
[42:23.39]I'm here.
[42:24.19]It's Tom Green versus Jim Carrey.
[42:27.09]That's the same guy.
[42:31.98]Same guy.
[42:32.32]All right, so coming up next, we are going to play.
[42:44.04]Wait, shh.
[42:47.32]I want to give her a high five.
[42:54.46]That was cute.
[42:59.54]We're going to play Sniper Elite VR next.
[43:07.71]Well, we will hope for peace in the universe.
[43:09.07]Thank you for playing the game.
[43:11.73]Sega Grounding Incorporated.
[43:13.99]Oh, shit.
[43:14.39]Hold on.
[43:19.25]What?
[43:20.23]That was my big... That was my big moment and I failed it.
[43:24.77]How did I fit?
[43:25.23]It said pose.
[43:27.20]What?
[43:31.02]I got 175%.
[43:31.22]All right, let's move on to Sniper Elite VR.
[43:36.96]I'm going to get some water.
[43:40.95]I was looking forward to that.
[43:42.27]I played all the other ones.
[43:43.07]But hold on a second here.
[43:45.15]Hold on.
[43:45.49]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[43:47.43]Arcade.
[43:49.53]Dressing room.
[43:51.07]Hold on a minute.
[43:58.99]Do I get any clothes?
[43:59.93]I kind of want to be the alien.
[44:11.83]Alright, I want to be this guy.
[44:24.32]Arcade, I'm curious.
[44:27.18]I think this is just the game, right?
[44:31.52]Miku's Far Out Report Show.
[44:33.68]Excuse me?
[44:36.10]Excuse me?
[44:36.78]Wait a minute.
[44:42.80]Hold on a minute.
[44:43.50]We're not skipping.
[44:47.02]Do you guys know that I thought that Miku was a real person?
[44:49.31]I didn't know that it was a Voka, whatever, robot.
[44:52.65]I thought it was like an actual singer.
[44:54.83]I didn't think it was a Voka, whatever they are.
[44:58.79]Until like six months ago, I thought Mika was just a singer.
[45:01.63]This is going to be hard to do.
[45:08.07]I'm going to try.
[45:08.68]Hopefully this is not too loud for you.
[45:11.32]Did I spill it?
[45:16.84]I don't think so.
[45:17.32]No, I don't think so.
[45:38.54]But I've heard some of Miku's songs.
[45:43.09]Who's Miku?
[45:45.99]How old are we?
[45:46.51]I don't know.
[45:47.25]She's real to me.
[45:50.05]Space drink, alcohol.
[45:52.25]There are no laws where you're drinking.
[45:54.47]It's not, I can't, I'm drinking a fucking White Claw.
[45:59.02]In a VR environment in my own space.
[46:08.00]I'm telling you guys, this helps.
[46:11.85]So two days ago, where I almost puked from the dinosaur game, that's not going to happen today.
[46:16.81]All right, should I be Ki or Roo?
[46:21.25]Hmm, Roo.
[46:25.83]I'm excited for this.
[46:37.98]Miku's Far Out Report.
[46:41.18]I thought she was like 8 feet tall.
[46:44.13]What?
[46:44.33]I thought she was like 7'7 or something.
[46:47.61]I thought she was huge.
[46:49.96]Who the fuck is that?
[47:10.55]Did I say that?
[47:12.13]Okay, are we ready?
[47:19.09]Here come the aliens.
[47:24.01]Time to dance.
[47:32.51]Who's this little weird guy?
[48:07.47]Let's go
[48:32.09]That's a cat!
[48:32.85]I don't wanna be a cat!
[48:35.30]Rescue successful!
[48:57.21]This is where I got to... Excuse me, Miku.
[48:58.59]Miku, before I get... Can I get a selfie real quick, Miku?
[49:02.05]I'm sorry.
[49:02.41]I'm just a huge fan.
[49:17.56]Oops.
[49:23.16]Oops.
[49:26.50]Hey, did the viewers go up because Miku's here now?
[49:40.76]Did they?
[49:41.10]Literally, yes.
[49:46.87]Oops.
[49:49.03]Shit.
[49:53.99]I was only halfway through.
[49:55.15]Holy shit.
[50:23.19]That's another successful rescue!
[50:40.21]Uh-oh, hard mode.
[50:40.99]GrooveBot Prime.
[50:45.70]Where are the guns, Jerma?
[50:56.22]Where are the guns?
[50:56.76]Where's the shooting?
[50:57.86]I know, just give me a minute.
[51:10.99]I can fucking move still, even with a pain condition.
[51:17.68]You'll never take that from me.
[51:18.86]You'll never get it from me.
[51:35.21]Stop making sounds for no reason.
[51:45.09]Oh, I don't wanna do that.
[52:12.94]Whatever.
[52:13.34]89?
[52:13.36]That's all right.
[52:25.92]This game makes... What?
[52:27.02]This game makes light of war?
[52:29.10]What are you talking about?
[52:33.52]Oh, this game makes light of war.
[52:39.17]Let's finish this together.
[52:47.05]What'd you think, Miku?
[52:50.71]Did you like what I did?
[52:51.85]Did you like me?
[52:52.69]Did you like what I did?
[52:56.47]Okay, I'll just be you.
[52:57.37]Do it normally.
[52:58.67]Oh, yeah, bye.
[53:02.79]See you later.
[53:03.26]Good wave.
[53:14.98]I think that's all to see.
[53:21.80]We gotta do this.
[53:23.38]Do it all.
[53:24.31]Not gonna open this game ever again.
[53:30.19]I mean, like, that's actually, like, not a... I'm never gonna open this game ever again.
[53:34.69]So, might as well do the stuff that's here.
[53:43.94]A hundred stage dance battle?
[53:45.44]Holy shit.
[53:46.76]Am I ready for this?
[53:56.87]You're gonna be dead after this game?
[53:58.17]I'm alive.
[54:00.07]I'm alive.
[54:01.29]I'm a human.
[54:03.26]My blood is red and it pumps.
[54:06.24]I like to fuck too.
[54:07.70]What does he say?
[54:08.20]Begin the hundred stage battle.
[54:34.64]Is that me?
[54:34.96]Oh no.

[62:44.59]I'm coming.
[62:49.28]That's too many.
[62:56.34]It's the gorilla driving the car.
[62:58.92]That's just the movies.
[63:00.14]Gorilla book.
[63:07.89]Gorilla reading book.

[63:52.05]Chew!
[63:52.55]Oh!
[64:01.60]Pose!
[64:02.76]Just do it all.
[64:04.22]Shit.
[64:04.96]Pose!
[64:05.80]Pose!
[64:06.64]Pose!
[64:07.46]Pose!
[64:08.32]Pose!
[64:09.14]Pose!
[64:09.92]Jaguar!
[64:22.09]Did I do it?
[64:22.45]Holy shit, I did it.
[64:28.24]I just sit out of the bed.
[64:32.23]It was a gorilla reading a book.
[64:33.73]He was driving a Jaguar.
[64:36.25]It's like, Mr. Albertson, you had hernia surgery.
[64:41.80]Are you okay?
[64:42.66]You've been in here for like a few days.
[64:44.00]All right, I think that's good.
[64:55.11]That was fun.
[64:56.17]Wait, let's see how many calories are burnt.
[64:57.39]180 calories.
[65:01.93]Wow.
[65:06.95]Alright, that was cool.
[65:08.74]I'm going to drink some water.
[65:09.46]We're going to do Sniper Elite VR.
[65:12.16]Talking to you.
[65:18.30]Only 180 calories?
[65:19.38]Yeah, that's not that much.
[65:21.77]Do the roar.
[65:23.81]Oh, what was wrong with Boneworks?
[65:24.89]Alright, hold on.
[65:26.99]I figured it out.
[65:28.75]So...
[65:29.99]Boneworks was a game that came out way before Alyx.
[65:34.74]And I remember it was like, wow, a game that's actually utilizing the knuckle controllers.
[65:40.76]And it's like, oh, look at the physics and shit.
[65:44.01]I played Alyx before I played Boneworks.
[65:47.11]Isn't that kind of an issue, right?
[65:50.80]Like, Alex is one of my favorite games, like, ever.
[65:53.62]It was my game of the year last year.
[65:54.96]It's the best VR game I've ever played.
[65:57.66]So I didn't play Boneworks before Alex, therefore, like, it was kind of a stepping stone to get to Alex in a way, right?
[66:04.43]I think that's why I found it a little underwhelming.
[66:06.77]At least me personally, right?
[66:13.03]Fuck you.
[66:14.35]I... Hey, listen.
[66:16.71]I didn't say that I thought... I don't think Boneworks is a bad game.
[66:20.92]It just didn't grab me.
[66:22.36]That's it.
[66:24.62]It's probably fucking really good.
[66:25.64]The physics are fucking awesome.
[66:26.74]It was really fun.
[66:27.40]The gun shooting seemed fun.
[66:28.70]The stuff having weight, that was cool.
[66:30.73]It just didn't grab me.
[66:32.15]And that's okay.
[66:34.73]That's okay.
[66:38.33]I don't think it's a bad game.
[66:40.53]I never said that.
[66:46.85]I think me playing Alex first...
[66:49.97]set expectations in a weird way.
[66:51.67]I don't know why.
[66:55.50]It was made to be innovative, not to be a good game.
[66:57.68]Well, I mean, it was, right?
[67:02.40]I remember watching the dev videos.
[67:04.18]I don't think it's a bad game.
[67:07.25]Stop putting words in my mouth.
[67:08.41]All right, Sniper Elite VR, if one of the mods could change it to Sniper Elite VR, that would be fantastic.
[67:16.93]Go ahead and move on.
[67:22.54]Can I not select it from here?
[67:25.18]Come on, dude.
[67:25.96]What the hell?
[67:30.32]Oh, really?
[67:30.82]I don't have to.
[67:33.55]Oh, shit.
[67:34.87]I can't select it.
[67:35.53]Wait.
[67:35.83]Oh, my God.
[67:36.37]I'm using this.
[67:36.99]All right.
[67:39.67]Sniper Elite VR.
[67:42.35]Where are you?
[67:43.61]There it is.
[67:43.93]All right.
[67:45.31]Let's do it.
[67:51.99]Pick up that can.
[68:04.67]You look like a gnome, your opinion doesn't matter.
[68:07.80]Oh, that's interesting.
[68:08.96]You know the gnomes are like part of the reason why the Alliance was able to get to the fucking place that they were?
[68:12.80]You understand the amount of cookies that you eat from those Keebler elves?
[68:15.94]Those little gnomes?
[68:17.80]Oh, but no, uh, fine.
[68:18.76]Fuck the gnomes, right?
[68:21.31]Understand how important they were?
[68:25.46]They protect your fucking garden, bro.
[68:27.94]Don't ever speak of that again.
[68:29.34]Alliance.
[68:36.36]All right, so this is Sniperly VR.
[68:38.96]I think this is probably fine.
[68:40.87]Subtitle's probably on, I would assume, right?
[68:44.23]Calibrate height.
[68:45.59]Cool.
[68:46.57]Comfort.
[68:47.81]Sprint vignette off.
[68:49.41]Smooth turn dot off.
[68:52.32]Belt size, ammo pouch position right.
[68:54.80]Kill cam normal.
[68:55.84]Kill cam follows bullet.
[68:57.28]I guess it's just default off.
[68:59.10]Graphics quality.
[68:59.70]Get that shit on fucking high, please.
[69:01.36]I got a 3090.
[69:01.72]Excuse me.
[69:07.86]What a flex.
[69:10.58]It's not a flex, though.
[69:11.43]I paid like three times the price for it.
[69:13.73]Like, it was a stupid thing to do.
[69:15.21]I had to get a graphics card.
[69:16.27]This is back when they didn't fucking exist.
[69:18.29]All right, let's go.
[69:19.81]This seems good.
[69:23.27]Okay, new game.
[69:26.12]Right-handed.
[69:32.38]Teleport movement, snap turning.
[69:36.40]Intense.
[69:37.06]Free movement.
[69:37.78]Why is he sick?
[69:39.26]Free movement, smooth turning.
[69:40.64]All comfort assists are off.
[69:43.86]Free movement, snap turning.
[69:46.24]What should I put on?
[69:52.97]Put it on intense?
[69:55.43]You will puke if I don't put it on something else.
[69:57.17]Okay.
[69:58.93]So should I do... I don't think I want to do intense.
[70:03.77]You look like an action figure.
[70:05.25]Thanks.
[70:07.49]Intense, intense, moderate.
[70:08.79]I'm going to do moderate.
[70:09.68]Okay.
[70:11.96]I don't want to puke.
[70:15.58]Difficulty select.
[70:17.34]That's fine.
[70:21.24]We're gonna get a giant, like, VR video playing.
[70:23.98]Take this opportunity.
[70:26.10]You know what I'm doing.
[70:28.18]Oh, you guys can't even see the movie.
[70:35.57]Uh, I am... This is not... I'm... The height's... The height's wrong.
[70:41.47]I need to recalibrate the height, please.
[70:44.07]Hold on.
[70:47.09]40 years ago, the world, this place.
[70:51.09]Oh my God.
[70:52.09]Very different.
[70:53.23]That's not, that didn't help.
[70:54.81]That didn't help.
[70:55.77]Oh my God.
[70:57.21]Revert, revert, revert, revert, revert.
[70:59.40]Why is it doing this?
[71:03.88]Why?
[71:04.06]I need to fix the floor.
[71:05.96]I'm way too fucking small.
[71:09.80]I am as tall as that child.
[71:13.23]Hold on.
[71:16.10]Not a day passes when I do not think of that time.
[71:20.85]When I'm not thankful that I am still here.
[71:24.79]This is wrong.
[71:29.37]I can't pick anything up.
[71:33.14]Why did we fight?
[71:35.70]That's a shitload of bread.
[71:37.32]We're gonna eat all this bread?
[71:49.72]This is de-dust.
[71:50.28]This is actually de-dust.
[71:52.32]I'm sitting?
[71:52.80]I don't remember sitting.
[71:53.88]Okay.
[72:12.81]Okay.
[72:13.09]Movement.
[72:13.51]Okay, walk here.
[72:15.07]Rotate.
[72:15.85]Alright, let's go.
[72:16.75]Hold down the grab button.
[72:18.71]Out of bounds?
[72:22.29]What the fuck are you talking about, dude?
[72:27.56]Hold down the grab button.
[72:39.63]Oh, get the rifle?
[72:40.75]How am I supposed to get the rifle?
[72:42.03]It's like blocked.
[72:44.27]What?
[72:45.75]Oh.
[72:47.77]Shit.
[72:53.01]It's the index.
[72:53.73]I have to hold it.
[72:55.13]Stow the rifle by putting it over your shoulder.
[72:56.89]Great.
[72:57.18]Another fucking put it over your shoulder bullshit.
[73:00.62]I'm full.
[73:01.80]Okay.
[73:04.04]Move to the window.
[73:12.39]Okay.
[73:12.77]Draw your rifle.
[73:14.65]You got it.
[73:15.15]Pull the bolt back.
[73:20.33]Retrieve ammo from your belt.
[73:22.97]Insert clip into rifle.
[73:28.44]Where does that go?
[73:34.58]Did that work?
[73:35.42]Push forward to reload.
[73:38.01]Okay.
[73:38.63]Hold on the rifle with your second hand.
[73:42.81]Raise and look through the scope.
[73:45.79]Oh my god.
[73:46.49]I don't know if you guys can see this.
[73:49.29]Can you guys see this?
[73:53.24]Can you guys see me aiming?
[73:57.74]You do?
[73:58.18]Okay.
[73:59.24]You can see through everything?
[74:00.54]Good.
[74:02.30]Look through the scope.
[74:03.08]Who am I shooting?
[74:05.23]Squeeze the trigger to fire.
[74:09.51]Okay.
[74:09.99]Steady yourself.
[74:10.65]Hold your breath.
[74:12.27]Like in real life.
[74:18.95]Hold focus to steady aim.
[74:20.77]Focus slowly slows time and shows the hit indicator.
[74:24.05]Okay.
[74:28.12]Hold focus to steady aim.
[74:29.52]How do I do that?
[74:31.32]Oh shit.
[74:32.40]That's a fucking headshot.
[74:42.44]Oh, this is fucking crazy.
[74:44.28]Radio!
[74:45.20]Where's the radio?
[74:49.90]Oh, there it is.
[74:55.90]Re-chamber.
[74:58.87]Use.
[75:00.63]Did I do it?
[75:03.83]Did I use the radio?
[75:06.95]Use.
[75:07.39]What do I do?
[75:12.18]Did I get it?
[75:15.84]Use.
[75:17.58]What do you want me to do?
[75:18.46]What does it want me to do?
[75:20.96]You already did it.
[75:24.44]Okay.
[75:28.69]Now what?
[75:33.85]It's a save point.
[75:35.97]Why did I throw the gun?
[75:36.93]I'll just get it.
[75:39.61]That guy took the gun.
[75:42.97]Get to the gate.
[75:43.93]Okay.
[75:44.49]Oh, I have a gun!
[75:45.27]Alright, pulse!
[76:24.84]That's Dante.
[76:25.66]Oh.
[76:26.97]Can I run faster?
[76:27.89]Sorry.
[76:30.07]Sorry, I'm the drunk guy again.
[76:31.43]Oh, shit.
[76:38.21]Dante!
[76:38.83]Dante!
[76:39.73]Let's go.
[76:40.15]Think you can fuck with me, buddy?
[76:56.07]Goodbye.
[76:56.57]That guy's dead.
[77:05.50]Oh, over there.
[77:10.18]What?
[77:10.56]I thought that was explosive.
[77:12.14]It was explosive.
[77:12.98]Why did it take so long to get there?
[77:22.81]Did I get him?
[77:23.87]I got him!
[77:25.47]Oh, sick!
[77:31.12]Shit!
[77:36.38]Got him!
[77:40.82]Headshot!
[77:42.30]Oh, right, his brain.
[77:44.30]Does bullet travel?
[77:45.20]Oops.
[78:10.14]Right in the knee.
[78:11.08]Alright, let's go.
[78:18.13]Here!
[78:18.81]Take the weapons!
[78:19.89]Take them all!
[78:20.43]Ammo.
[78:21.25]What's this?
[78:36.79]Let's go!
[78:46.03]Jump!
[78:47.81]Is that a bad guy or is that a good guy?
[78:58.04]You can imagine how much of a... I feel like this is like a modded Call of Duty.
[79:01.77]Alright, I got full ammo.
[79:05.27]Let's go.
[79:14.48]Oh, you motherfucker!
[79:15.92]Oh, shit.
[79:22.42]God damn it!
[79:31.27]Got it.
[79:38.76]Who's left?
[79:39.32]What?
[79:39.68]Who's left?
[79:46.53]Fuck.
[79:47.49]I can get him.
[79:48.53]I can get him.
[79:51.83]I'm not out of bounds, you stupid game.
[79:53.81]Stop shaking!
[79:55.19]Oh, it hit right in the mouth.
[79:57.81]Who's left?
[80:18.04]I'm not even out of bounds.
[80:19.18]This is stupid.
[80:26.94]Where is he?
[80:27.24]No!
[80:28.04]I did it.
[80:30.10]You're stupid.
[80:30.91]It was all scripted.
[80:33.17]Who cares?
[80:47.25]The Nazi attack had been a reprisal for the death of a senior German officer.
[80:52.71]You're so sweaty.
[80:54.23]I know.
[80:54.81]The fatal bullet fired by me.
[80:58.31]The Germans knew I was responsible, and they struck back without mercy, killing partisans and villagers alike.
[81:06.14]It was a slaughter.
[81:08.72]Better?
[81:10.88]Oh, hello, kids.
[81:11.80]Without his death, we'd lost our leader.
[81:16.39]It would have been easy for us to give up, to lose hope.
[81:20.40]You look like a dancer.
[81:22.66]We strengthened our resolve.
[81:25.90]We would need it for what was still to come.
[81:29.10]This game sucks.
[81:30.80]That's not fair.
[81:31.70]That's not fair.
[81:32.32]Don't say that.
[81:33.28]It actually was kind of fun.
[81:38.80]This place has so many memories.
[81:43.88]I'm actually just kidding.
[81:45.20]It's actually kind of fun.
[81:50.69]Boneworks 2?
[81:51.67]No, I'm just kidding.
[81:52.64]This is actually fun.
[81:56.64]New mission.
[81:57.22]Let's do it.
[82:01.22]What am I doing out here?
[82:03.72]Wait, did he have bread in his hand?
[82:09.40]Wait, I think she has bread in her hands.
[82:15.50]God damn it, it's my day off.
[82:16.78]Just leave me alone out here.
[82:19.66]Can I just get... Why can't I just read Calvin and Hobbes in peace?
[82:22.60]I don't have a gun.
[82:35.55]Alright, let's do it.
[82:40.44]Rifle range?
[82:44.10]Okay, let's go.
[82:44.42]No scopes.
[82:44.82]Rick and Morty now.
[82:46.23]No.
[82:46.89]You look like an Oompa Loompa.
[82:48.29]Just rewind an hour and figure out why.
[82:50.71]I just have these always, like... Oh, wait, no.
[83:14.08]It's just Mjolnir.
[83:17.78]He would stay here for hours making me practice with his Carcano M91.
[83:22.91]A relic from the Great War.
[83:25.09]What?
[83:25.85]Critiquing every shot.
[83:35.87]This is way better than that.
[83:44.44]Ooh!
[83:45.52]What do you got?
[83:51.45]Ten targets?
[83:52.03]Where are they?
[83:57.01]Let's go!
[84:01.96]Why do I have to do this?
[84:02.84]I just... You just taught me how to use the rifle.
[84:07.26]I drew on the hours I had spent with Father's Rifle.
[84:14.28]This is so loud.
[84:15.24]Alright.
[84:23.70]I'm gonna talk shit about VR again.
[84:26.82]I'm just gonna talk shit.
[84:27.76]Let's do it.
[84:29.24]This doesn't have to be here.
[84:32.88]You just showed me how to play the game.
[84:34.86]I don't have to learn how to play.
[84:37.18]You just showed it to me.
[84:39.54]Do I need a tutorial shooting range?
[84:42.44]You just showed me how to play the game!
[84:44.96]Why are you so terrified that I'm gonna, like, not know how to shoot the gun?
[84:54.64]Just do it.
[84:55.38]I- but I'm s- you know what I mean?

[85:08.21]It's like, let me tell you about this immersive story!
[85:11.98]Are you sure you know how to use the weapon?
[85:14.12]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[85:15.02]Get him out to a range and make sure he can hit a target.
[85:27.69]It is so loud.
[85:28.61]I know.
[85:29.29]Well, I'm going to turn it down.
[85:36.28]Oh, come on.
[85:43.82]I knew where each shot would land before I even pulled the trigger.
[85:48.28]Deadly.
[85:50.38]Your voice was loud?
[85:51.66]Oh.
[85:53.68]You're talking mad smack for reloading with the wrong hand.

[86:28.05]So where is it?
[86:29.19]Do I have to... Is it another range?
[86:38.55]It's another shooting range, isn't it?
[86:42.37]God.
[86:43.51]Just let us play.
[86:44.95]You're just terrified.
[86:49.99]You're terrified that we don't know what we're doing.
[86:53.87]Okay, so pick up the grenade.
[86:56.36]They won't even let me do that.
[87:03.96]Okay.
[87:05.08]Hold to aim.
[87:08.64]Okay, hold to aim.

[87:14.97]Hold to aim.
[87:15.57]Okay.

[87:20.63]Oh, I pulled it out.
[87:30.10]Alright.
[87:33.88]I'm literally sitting right in the center of my play area.
[87:37.34]What are you talking about?
[87:38.87]Okay, pistol area.

[93:04.90]I can't have all three?
[93:05.84]Hey.
[93:11.01]What the fuck are you talking about?
[93:13.79]Place your favorite weapons into these loadout crates and they'll be shipped off to the various partisan safe houses for use within the missions.
[93:21.91]Each consignment must have a rifle...
[93:37.63]I don't know.
[93:37.99]Whatever.
[93:40.59]Can't read.

[94:23.90]I know.
[94:24.14]Alright, I'm ready to play a mission.
[94:29.28]I don't like how high I am.
[94:38.31]Okay, let's do it.
[94:45.35]I gotta pee.
[94:48.67]I'm with this book again.
[94:50.23]Did I have another kid in the meantime?
[95:03.40]I'm drinking water.
[95:04.14]Everybody relax.
[95:13.74]Oh, that's, I hate that.
[95:17.54]Okay.
[95:20.23]Let's go.
[95:20.61]Here we go.
[95:22.65]In the moments before his death, Dante had made a contact with the allies and begged them for help.
[95:27.47]We could only keep fighting.
[95:28.69]Hope they had heard.
[95:29.81]Let's go.
[95:31.30]In the moments before his death, Dante had made contact with the allies and begged them for help.
[95:38.98]We could only keep fighting, hoping that they heard and prayed they would be here in time.
[95:44.66]Actually, let me untangle this.
[95:46.66]Protect the partisans, stop the attack.
[95:51.24]Alright, stop the attack.
[95:52.75]From the tower, I could slow the enemy, but we would need help from above to stop them.
[96:11.16]You got it!
[96:16.44]Where they at?
[96:25.17]Shit!
[96:31.41]Fuck!
[96:31.83]I got it.
[96:32.74]Right in his liver.
[96:40.39]I'm fine.
[96:40.99]Quiet.
[96:41.31]Oh shit.
[96:52.30]Can I get it?
[96:52.70]Damn it.
[96:52.94]I missed.
[96:53.36]Wait.
[96:53.50]He's moving so fast.
[96:54.72]I didn't get it?
[97:22.64]This is- Where we at?
[97:23.22]Oh shit, how am I supposed to- What?!
[97:24.38]That was right in his head!
[98:04.82]Oh my god, how did I miss him?
[98:11.89]Fuck!

[98:16.57]Oh my god.

[99:46.19]Closing in.
[99:52.41]Who needs a thriver?
[99:59.35]Give me the gun.
[100:10.21]What are you talking about?
[100:11.37]I'm in the fucking play area.
[100:13.47]Play area.
[100:15.21]Oh my...
[100:26.18]Oh my God, what am I hitting?
[100:39.61]What?
[100:48.48]Kill him already!
[100:49.34]Oh my God!
[100:50.42]It wasn't much, but if it could destroy the bridges, it might be enough.
[100:55.16]Attempt to radio reinforcements.
[100:56.78]Prepare for the next wave.
[100:58.84]Oh, fuck.
[101:01.64]Um, okay.
[101:14.87]Okay.
[101:15.73]Now... What?
[101:18.13]Oh, shit.
[101:18.83]Do I... I have bullets in this.
[101:28.70]I saw the guy in the head.
[101:29.94]I saw the guy in the head.
[101:31.36]I saw the guy in the head with a shotgun from like 600 meters away.
[101:34.64]Holy shit.
[101:41.56]Give me the... Alright, sniper rifle.
[101:42.90]Let's go.
[101:43.34]Got him.
[102:05.91]Ah!
[102:12.82]Damn it!
[102:13.42]I hit him!
[102:16.68]I can't!
[102:19.92]Wait, what the fuck?!
[102:27.16]No!
[102:27.85]What?! !
[102:31.99]Oh my god!
[102:32.93]I'm not fucking around anymore.
[102:33.77]Just no fucking ammo in this gun!
[102:34.65]I'm trying as hard as I can, let's go.
[103:04.81]What the fuck are you talking about?
[103:06.33]Dang.
[103:19.87]Not this time.
[103:20.53]Not fucking around this time.
[103:22.07]I'm not fucking around this time.
[103:29.11]That's it, right?
[103:29.75]Nope.
[103:34.09]Right in the head.
[103:35.55]You gotta be kidding me.
[103:36.29]You saw that.
[103:36.77]You can see through my eye.
[103:40.31]Where is he?
[103:42.59]Where is he?
[103:42.91]Alright, where's the car?
[103:51.68]Blow it up!
[103:52.04]Oh my god, why?
[104:11.66]What?!
[104:12.38]I'm trying to blow the car up!
[104:16.48]How is that not- Oh, fuck.
[104:30.19]Oh shit, they're over here.
[104:34.47]Dante's pleas had worked.
[104:37.29]The Allies had sent a bomber to try to cut off the enemy.
[104:54.29]I- I don't understand.
[104:57.56]Oh my g- I hit the- Give me a grenade.
[105:25.77]Why am I so bad at that?
[105:27.37]Give me this.
[105:40.49]There's no... What is happening?
[106:09.14]Where you at?
[106:09.50]I have to pee so bad, you have no idea.
[106:15.68]Okay, next wave.
[106:24.73]I gotta pee.
[106:25.81]You have no idea how bad I have to pee right now.
[106:27.41]It's awful.
[106:33.26]Piss your pants.
[106:36.20]No.
[106:37.28]Is this health?
[106:40.80]That's not health.
[106:41.48]Why?
[106:54.08]Oh, he's right there.
[106:54.62]Okay, I see him.
[107:00.56]Oh, that's how I feel right now.
[107:07.81]Oh, that felt good.
[107:09.24]That actually felt really good to play.
[107:10.60]Give me that.
[107:12.08]Give me, give me, give me.
[107:17.92]All right.
[107:26.06]Over this way, right?
[107:26.74]Yep.
[107:27.08]Over here.
[107:30.24]Fucking no scope.
[107:31.38]Get the fuck out of here.
[107:39.85]Got it.
[107:49.52]How did he shoot me?
[107:50.74]I'm literally standing all the way back here.
[107:52.82]What the fuck?
[107:59.92]I'm giving this one more try.
[108:02.48]One more try and I'm out of here.
[108:04.66]What the fuck?
[108:05.17]Yes, I'm sure.
[108:05.79]What do you think goes in here?
[108:07.17]I think I'm just going to use this.
[108:29.01]What a worthless fucking weapon, seriously.
[108:30.77]Like, why would I even use that fucking stupid thing?
[108:38.55]I'm angry now, let's go.
[108:55.34]Father had taken charge of the unit.
[108:58.29]Shit!
[108:58.43]Run it, run it, run it, gimme, gimme, gimme!
[109:02.07]It doesn't even do anything!
[109:25.95]Bomb!
[109:26.41]Oh my god.
[109:27.20]Where are you shooting this guy?
[109:58.83]Right in the head.
[109:59.51]Go on.
[109:59.91]Come on.
[110:02.71]This way.
[110:03.27]Right here.
[110:03.65]This motherfucker right in this hallway.
[110:05.37]Get the fuck out of here.
[110:07.45]Shatter it.
[110:08.33]Come on.
[110:09.99]Here we go.
[110:19.78]Come on, Gwen.
[110:26.46]Come on, you fucker.
[110:40.10]God, I can't see!
[110:41.04]Oh, fuck!
[110:47.33]Hey!
[110:48.55]Okay, I... You've no idea I got a piece so fucking bad, it's hurting.
[111:14.01]God, I can't aim that way.
[111:15.25]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[111:25.23]I'm ready, let's go.
[111:26.47]No more fucking around.
[111:28.05]Take him out.
[111:29.53]God damn it.
[111:34.28]Where's the center?
[111:34.94]Alright, I'm good.
[111:41.40]I might actually piss my pants on stream.
[111:44.34]In VR.
[111:50.09]Shit.
[111:56.09]He's dead.
[111:56.67]Alright, we're out.
[111:58.27]This way, this way, this way, this way, this way, this way, this way.
[112:10.21]Get down, get down, get down, get down, get down.
[112:19.68]Get... Got it.
[112:25.34]Got it.
[112:25.64]Yes!
[112:25.96]That's not it.
[112:27.36]That was a YouTube poop video.
[112:39.02]They use that same loud fucking noise in every YouTube poop.
[112:51.51]You fucker!
[112:52.53]What the fuck?
[112:53.81]Help me!
[112:54.79]Help!
[112:55.92]Help!
[112:57.78]Why?
[112:58.42]Where is he?
[113:20.87]Hey!
[113:21.27]Hey!
[113:22.03]I see him.
[113:22.41]Okay.
[113:32.84]Oh, my God.
[113:33.54]That didn't hit him in the head.
[113:34.66]Come on.
[113:46.73]I'm done with that one.
[113:49.83]I'm going to the bathroom.
[113:50.69]I'm playing something else.
[113:51.33]I'm going to pee.
[113:58.42]What the fuck?
[114:03.04]The hair.
[114:03.44]I'll be right back.
[118:47.05]I'm back.
[118:49.19]That game was really fun.
[118:49.95]It was just kind of hard.
[118:51.23]I like the scope.
[118:53.51]Give that one a stamp of approval.
[118:58.57]It was fun.
[118:59.91]Let me untangle this thing.
[119:01.23]Hold on.
[119:11.45]We had a party while you were gone.
[119:21.26]All right, let me take a look at what I have left.
[119:22.56]There's so many VR games.
[119:24.44]Let me see what's... I need to wipe this down a little.
[119:27.52]Give me one second.
[119:36.79]Oh, the volume's gonna have to come down, too.
[119:41.37]He forgot to wipe.
[119:44.11]I can't believe I did the fart in the microphone joke, by the way.
[119:53.48]The whole time I was peeing, I'm just thinking about the fart in the microphone thing.
[119:58.18]Fuck, I did do that, didn't I?
[119:59.42]All right, I'm going back in.
[120:02.10]I'm going to turn the cam back on in 30 seconds or so.
[120:05.05]Hold on, let me just get in here.
[120:11.29]What should we play?
[120:13.19]Let's take a look.
[120:18.27]That was Sniper Elite VR, and it was pretty good.
[120:24.05]We've got... L.A.
[120:28.31]Noire Case Files.
[120:31.07]Arbar.
[120:33.81]Compound.
[120:38.39]We've got Hellsplit Arena.
[120:43.05]We've got Rick and Morty.
[120:44.21]Virtual Rickality.
[120:45.11]Of course we do.
[120:48.89]I wonder.
[120:49.19]What should we do?
[120:56.49]Compound?
[120:59.05]L.A.
[120:59.23]Noire.
[120:59.53]L.A.
[120:59.87]Noire.
[121:01.77]I'll do L.A.
[121:02.27]Noire.
[121:03.99]Is L.A.
[121:04.27]Noire long?
[121:06.05]How long is L.A.
[121:06.61]Noire?
[121:13.13]It's 20 hours in VR.
[121:14.93]Oh my god.
[121:16.51]It's the whole game in VR?
[121:18.75]No, it's not?
[121:22.71]I thought it was the VR case files.
[121:25.17]It's like 30 minutes.
[121:26.25]Okay.
[121:26.53]All right.
[121:27.79]I'm going to load it up and we'll give it 30, 40 minutes.
[121:29.89]We'll see.
[121:30.17]We'll give it an hour.
[121:34.21]LA Noire, the VR case files.
[121:35.81]Let's go.
[121:36.11]All right.
[121:37.68]I'm coming back on.
[121:42.94]Hello there.
[121:43.40]Hi.
[121:44.62]How are you doing?
[121:46.66]I might have to lower the volume here.
[121:54.87]So there's a lot of people that wanted me to go back to L.A.
[121:56.89]Noire after I played it two or three times and got halfway through the game and gave up forever.
[122:03.04]Here is your stream.
[122:05.40]This is probably the last time I'm ever going to play this.
[122:06.76]I have piss stains.

[143:49.99]Anything?

[144:43.74]Shooter put him up against the wall and blew his brains out.
[144:46.96]Hell of a way to go.
[144:49.70]Doesn't really matter how you go.
[144:51.08]I should be taller.
[144:52.60]Don't get all deep on me, Phelps.
[144:54.58]Okay, take that into evidence.
[145:04.31]Where am I?
[145:09.65]Looks like there was a break over here of some kind.

[146:20.60]Grip settings.
[146:21.12]That'll be all right.
[146:22.74]What have we got in here?
[146:35.97]Two rounds fired.
[146:37.61]And instead of dropping it down a drain, our shooter hoists it up here.
[146:41.32]Interesting guy.
[146:42.64]Interesting.
[146:43.72]We should follow up on this now, before the perp tries to leave town.

[157:22.43]Schroeder's apartment, 11.06 PM.
[157:28.21]How come I can't use the right A to run?
[157:39.85]That's kind of annoying.
[157:40.89]See, I can only use left A. What's happening?
[157:45.52]Where does he live?
[157:50.58]Right here somewhere?

[158:00.28]Have you ever heard Schroder?
[158:01.36]Have you ever heard the name Schroder?
[158:03.27]Do you know what Schroder is?
[158:04.29]I am an officer of the law.
[158:12.51]I'm an officer of the court.
[158:15.47]Okay, whatever.
[158:18.40]Get me the fuck out of here.
[158:20.42]Where's the apartment?
[158:21.22]Here?
[158:27.39]In here?
[158:30.31]Doors with knobs can be turned.
[158:34.93]Alright.
[158:35.63]We're looking for Schroeder.
[158:38.31]Sherwood.
[158:38.87]Schroeder.
[158:39.47]Schroeder.
[158:39.97]Apartment 2.
[158:41.31]Looks good.
[158:41.89]Apartment 2.
[158:43.03]Apartment 2.
[158:45.05]Let's go.
[158:46.35]Cole.
[158:47.46]Follow my lead.
[158:53.17]That was horrible.
[158:54.15]That made me actually want to throw up.
[158:55.55]I don't know what happened, but whatever.
[158:56.63]We're going to keep going.
[158:58.13]Alright, apartment two is the apartment we need to go into.
[159:06.02]Let's go ahead.
[159:08.10]Let's go ahead and knock.
[159:13.55]What do you guys want?
[159:14.85]I'm Officer Cole Phelps.
[159:15.89]This is Officer Dunn, Wilshire Division.
[159:18.45]You're the owner of a Smith & Wesson Model 27 nickel-plated with pearl grips?
[159:22.73]I might be.
[159:24.18]What of it?
[159:24.94]Then you'll be surprised to know that Scooter Payton was murdered tonight with your gun.
[159:29.58]You're out of your mind.
[159:31.04]Scooter, he works for me.
[159:32.78]I have that gun here in my drawer.
[159:35.82]You mind if we come in?
[159:38.40]What the fuck is going on here?
[159:39.79]You're under arrest, Schroeder.
[159:41.25]Cuff him, Ralph.
[159:41.83]No way.
[159:42.43]You're not taking me down for this.
[159:45.57]You ready, tough guy?
[159:51.49]What the fuck?
[159:52.67]Help.
[159:53.11]Help.
[159:54.13]Help.
[159:54.83]Help.
[159:57.17]Where am I?
[159:58.71]Why is the VR fucking out?
[160:02.02]Help.
[160:02.80]What happened?
[160:05.14]I don't understand.
[160:07.14]Hello?
[160:14.41]Am I still alive?
[160:15.81]Oh my God.
[160:17.00]Where does it think I am?
[160:18.88]Where does it think I am?
[160:19.90]I don't understand.
[160:21.36]Where does it think I am?
[160:25.14]What's happening to my character?
[160:33.40]What's, why is it doing this?
[160:37.26]Oh my God.
[160:37.92]Come to me.
[160:38.54]Come to me.
[160:39.02]Okay.
[160:39.44]It's like shaking around.
[160:40.50]This is horrible.
[160:50.59]Am I punching someone?
[160:51.83]Alright, what on earth is going on?
[161:04.65]Ralph, you alright?
[161:05.98]I'm fine, I hardly felt anything.
[161:08.18]Hold on, I... He's lucky he caught me off guard.
[161:10.22]What the fuck?
[161:11.30]I have a shadow.
[161:12.28]That freaked me out so much.
[161:13.36]I'm gonna take a look around.
[161:15.88]Oh my god, what is this doing?
[161:20.01]Are you guys seeing the same thing?
[161:20.99]I'm horrible.
[161:23.37]I'm in the center of my play area.
[161:24.67]What the fuck does it think I'm doing?
[161:28.56]Okay, I gotta take this off.
[161:29.70]Like this is fucking horrible.
[161:31.68]What is this doing?
[161:35.54]I didn't like unplug it or anything, did I?
[161:38.02]No.
[161:40.16]Where does it think I am?
[161:45.41]Jesus.
[161:51.79]Wake up, Cole.
[161:52.63]I'm right in the middle of my play area.
[161:58.57]Okay.
[161:59.13]What do you want me to do?
[162:00.27]Look for clues?
[162:09.85]Oh my God!
[162:10.85]I thought he was gonna shoot himself!
[162:13.51]What the fuck is happening?
[162:15.86]Oh my God!
[162:18.64]What's the fuck?
[162:22.17]What?
[162:22.93]Why would you hold it there?
[162:24.73]Ow.
[162:28.08]Oh my God, what were you doing?
[162:30.14]He's like fucking... This whole thing is fucked up right now.
[162:37.94]My VR is like shaking.
[162:40.24]All right, I gotta get out of this game.
[162:42.06]There's something fucking horribly wrong right now.
[162:45.82]I gotta change games.
[162:46.68]Like this is fun, but like, holy shit.
[162:48.88]Where does it think I am?
[162:53.27]Is it shaky like you guys?
[162:55.19]Cole, we got things to do.
[163:00.00]It's so frame ratey.
[163:01.42]Yeah.
[163:02.04]No, I got to go.
[163:03.04]Okay.
[163:03.62]Fucking goodbye.
[163:04.64]Goodbye.
[163:04.92]I'm sorry.
[163:05.44]Rockstar, what the fuck is this bullshit?
[163:07.97]Base stations are both on.
[163:08.93]Everything's normal.
[163:22.76]What the fuck?
[163:24.60]Oh my god.
[163:27.48]This whole thing is fucked up.
[163:31.03]Okay.
[163:32.15]Give me a moment while I figure out what the hell is going on.
[163:34.89]Um...
[163:51.16]I've been playing for like the last three hours.
[163:54.26]Hold on a second.
[163:59.77]Can I reactivate the camera?
[164:03.91]Okay, the camera's back.
[164:05.89]Weird.
[164:06.07]What about SteamVR?
[164:09.99]No, SteamVR is fucked up.
[164:12.83]I think I have to leave the game, guys.
[164:14.08]I'm sorry.
[164:16.34]This was like really fun, but I'm gonna try to restart it maybe.
[164:19.73]Hold on, I'm gonna go BRB for a second.
[164:21.30]Give me one sec.
[165:53.69]Ralph, you all right?
[165:55.70]I'm fine.
[165:56.30]I hardly felt it.
[165:58.24]He's lucky.
[166:30.03]Okay.
[166:31.52]Uh, I've reset the game.
[166:32.40]Let's see if that fixes it.
[166:34.30]But first, let me get some water and a little bit more, uh, you know.
[166:38.68]You know.
[166:44.92]Ugh.
[166:47.84]Don't even.
[166:48.22]Is this doing it again?
[166:48.84]I think it is.
[166:52.12]No, don't do it again.
[166:52.98]Come on.
[167:04.12]Keep an eye on him, Ralph.
[167:05.68]It really doesn't like when I move out of the play area, like at all.
[167:08.00]I'm gonna take a look around.
[167:10.40]I think we're good.
[167:13.10]Alright, let's do it.
[167:14.22]If it fucks up again, if it freaks out again, then I'm gonna, uh... We'll play something else.
[167:21.26]Going in.
[167:25.44]Hmm.
[167:31.30]This is all bullshit.
[167:32.20]You hear me?
[167:33.24]I told you everything I know.
[167:40.96]Alright.
[167:41.94]Just checking my hair real quick.
[167:46.74]Stay down.
[167:50.52]Oh, no.
[167:51.06]Nope.
[167:51.82]No, this is fucked.
[167:55.42]This is really fucked.
[167:57.12]Yeah, this is fucked up.
[167:59.01]Yeah, I don't know if...
[168:03.48]I don't know if L.A.
[168:04.34]Noire is going to work out.
[168:07.38]Somebody said that this came out when the Vive was a thing.
[168:10.40]And they probably haven't updated it in a very long time.
[168:14.78]Damn it.
[168:16.34]Oh, well.
[168:18.04]Give me one sec.
[168:22.68]It crashes a lot.
[168:24.55]The cord's fine.
[168:25.31]Yeah, I checked the cords.
[168:26.47]Everything seems plugged in.
[168:28.92]This is an old ass game.
[168:30.28]It doesn't support index.
[168:31.66]Fuck.
[168:32.34]Well, that was fun for what I got to see.
[168:37.72]It's time for Rick and Morty.
[168:39.48]All right.
[168:39.78]I will play Rick and Morty VR for 30 minutes if you promise that none of you will leave.
[168:51.26]Promise me you won't leave and I'll do it.
[168:52.68]All right.
[168:57.40]Library.
[168:57.90]What do we got?
[168:59.51]Um, let me see if there's something else I want to play.
[169:04.50]There's... Hmm.
[169:09.38]I want to play Compound.
[169:10.88]That looked really fun.
[169:11.61]Alright, we're playing Compound.
[169:16.55]Let me go pee one more time, because I know I'm going to have to in like five minutes.
[169:19.05]I'll be right back.
[171:02.39]Okay, I'm back.
[171:04.37]Let's go ahead and open up Compound.
[171:10.22]And we'll continue.
[171:11.76]Mods, change it to Compound, please, if you could.
[171:20.33]That's so sad.
[171:22.51]That seemed like that was really picking up, too.
[171:24.41]Oh, well.
[171:27.83]Oh, well.
[171:37.61]I want to see more thriving.
[171:42.05]That was kind of terrible, to be honest.
[171:44.73]I really felt like I was going to be sick.
[171:46.69]Because when you're moving, but you're not moving forward, it really does a toll on your brain.
[171:55.92]It just hammers you right in the frontal lobe.
[171:58.42]All right, let's do it.
[172:02.56]Compound time.
[172:06.90]Damn, dude, you shit out of that fat ass?
[172:09.31]Listen to me.
[172:10.67]You have to understand something.
[172:13.41]I, look, I'm wearing a thing that's like compressing my back.
[172:19.25]So it might look like I have, whatever.
[172:24.84]What do you want me to say?
[172:29.46]Why did I read that?
[172:30.30]Because it was there and it was for me.
[172:32.30]I could see it.
[172:38.60]I could see it.
[172:39.18]All right, let's go.
[172:56.73]Wait, you can't even see.
[172:57.43]Hey, I can.
[173:01.23]Compound VR.
[173:02.45]Let's do it.
[173:08.76]I gotta bring you guys back.
[173:09.98]Shit.
[173:15.00]Oh, no.
[173:17.94]Aha.
[173:18.06]All right, let's move.
[173:23.57]All right, currently selected no snap turning.
[173:25.49]Looks like Minecraft.
[173:29.95]Select your controllers.
[173:31.27]I am using the... How do I select?
[173:35.06]Oh.
[173:37.50]The index.
[173:40.12]This is the valve index.
[173:42.20]Turning option.
[173:42.94]It looks like it's snap.
[173:44.44]No snap turning.
[173:46.36]Locomotion.
[173:47.32]That sounds good to me.
[173:50.76]I think this is probably pretty good.
[173:52.04]Pick up the gun, pistol, and shoot the icons.
[173:55.81]Select the desired options.
[173:59.53]All right, let's move.
[174:01.61]This feels pretty good.
[174:03.93]How loud is that?
[174:05.09]Why can't I see you guys?
[174:08.24]What the fuck is that?
[174:08.70]Did it crash?
[174:11.86]What the fuck?
[174:14.26]Come on!
[174:19.06]Report this to the developers.
[174:22.70]Give me another second.
[174:23.66]Hold on.
[174:24.08]Is it loud?
[174:33.44]I'll turn it down a little bit.
[174:49.36]Okay.
[174:50.24]Report.
[174:50.66]I was playing L.A.
[174:51.58]Noire.
[174:52.00]Yeah, so L.A.
[174:52.68]Noire really fucked everything up.
[174:55.65]Make sure that fixed... No, there's another, like, crash tab.
[175:01.69]What the fuck?
[175:04.87]What?
[175:11.55]Let me... I'm gonna restart SteamVR.
[175:13.47]Hold on.
[175:14.29]This whole thing is messed up now.
[177:07.25]Okay, we're good.
[177:09.73]Sorry about that.
[177:10.23]I have come back from the crash.
[177:17.80]Go back in, sorry.
[177:19.42]VR is a very finicky, finicky beast, okay?
[177:23.52]Compound.
[177:29.62]Thank you for your patience, appreciate it.
[177:33.26]And we should be able to go back into this now.
[177:38.42]Can you see it?
[177:39.70]No.
[177:40.54]There I am.
[177:42.08]And you should be here.
[177:43.72]There you are.
[177:44.80]Fantastic.
[177:46.77]All right, let's try this again.
[177:49.41]Fucking VR.
[177:49.99]All right, get me in.
[178:01.37]Apologize for the loud noises when I touch this thing.
[178:04.45]I'm capturing.
[178:06.05]There you guys are.
[178:06.99]Thank you.
[178:09.83]All right, back to it, come on.
[178:16.07]Bingo.
[178:17.87]Index.
[178:18.65]This is fucking loud though, it really is.
[178:21.56]Loud for me.
[178:25.74]Which means it's probably really loud for you.
[178:32.14]Rebel HQ.
[178:33.40]Fuck, it's itchy.
[178:38.42]I hear it back.
[178:41.86]This is really kind of nice looking though.
[178:44.26]Tutorial and shooting range.
[178:47.47]Very cool.
[178:48.37]Ooh, it actually is like completely index compatible.
[178:51.93]Nice, nice.
[178:53.03]It is like, this is cool.
[178:54.55]I like it.
[178:56.27]I really actually really like it a lot so far.
[179:07.48]Alright, cool.
[179:07.88]You make hamburgers and shit.
[179:09.02]That's awesome.
[179:10.44]Uh, currently selected.
[179:11.60]Easy as pie.
[179:12.52]Medium.
[179:15.58]Uh, I don't want hard boost.
[179:16.80]That's, I would probably throw up.
[179:20.14]Okay, let's do the, uh, shooting range.
[179:24.70]Ooh.
[179:26.66]Hot dogs, horseshoes, and hand grenades.
[179:28.37]Is this by the same people?
[179:34.10]Dude, this is fucking really, actually really fun.
[179:37.15]That was cool.
[179:37.79]Do I have to reload it?
[179:41.83]How do I reload?
[179:47.15]Okay.
[179:49.91]Fire a few bursts at the target until you completely run out of ammo in the horizontal clip.
[179:54.49]Notice the bullet spread is too high to hit anything distant.
[179:57.41]Sure.
[179:57.63]Okay.
[180:00.89]Reloading is a skill and you'll need to practice
[180:06.56]How do I get it?
[180:11.54]To reload the SMG, press the spawn ammo button on your offhand controller, pull a clip out, and attach it to the top.
[180:21.58]Oh shit.
[180:24.61]Okay.
[180:27.39]Hang off the clip, you'll be ready to fire.
[180:33.27]How do I do it?
[180:35.73]Weapon action button.
[180:37.40]Oh shit.
[180:48.44]That's cool.
[180:49.20]All right.
[180:49.72]What about the other ones?
[180:51.52]What is this?
[180:53.04]Oh, this feels really good.
[180:55.81]Okay.
[180:56.23]Now I can, how do I open this?
[180:59.27]All right.
[180:59.65]Like you need to go like this.
[181:06.07]That's fun.
[181:07.11]What about this one?
[181:10.08]Do I have to hold it with two hands?
[181:11.06]I do.
[181:12.50]Oh, shit.
[181:12.96]It's like a sniper rifle.
[181:15.42]All right.
[181:15.72]How do I load this one?
[181:22.10]Good noise.
[181:22.54]It's got really good noises.
[181:23.92]It does.
[181:25.49]How do I load?
[181:25.93]Railgun is perfect for dealing with high damage, long range, right?
[181:29.25]Four shots.
[181:30.35]Take your time.
[181:33.79]Okay.
[181:34.77]Put a stripper clip on the bolt opening on top of the rail gun.
[181:39.43]Doesn't it go in here?
[181:42.96]It doesn't do that?
[181:43.50]It doesn't do that?
[181:48.66]How do I do that?
[181:49.12]Am I doing this wrong?
[181:52.32]How do I do that?
[181:53.94]Line it up?
[182:01.72]What?
[182:04.12]Face forward.
[182:04.82]What are you talking about?
[182:09.59]What?
[182:10.65]Orange goes forward.
[182:15.49]Oh!
[182:22.24]This thing is... Okay, that's cool.
[182:23.28]What about this one?
[182:35.95]Nice, what else?
[182:40.25]How do I... Oh shit!
[182:50.72]So far, the gunplay is fucking phenomenal, I will say.
[183:01.94]Oh!
[183:04.82]Alright, how do I reload this?
[183:05.80]Is this like this?
[183:10.12]Oh shit.
[183:14.93]Okay, what about this one?
[183:15.99]This is fun!
[183:22.39]Okay, now this goes... Where does this go?
[183:26.19]In here?
[183:34.36]Cool.
[183:35.92]I didn't use this one.
[183:36.70]What does this one do?
[183:37.26]Okay.
[183:45.07]How does this one reload?
[183:45.81]Just like that?
[183:55.37]I love it.
[183:56.31]I actually... Oh, there's a bow and arrow?
[183:58.51]Are you kidding me?
[183:59.51]Oops.
[184:00.68]Where am I?
[184:05.89]Give me that.
[184:06.97]No way.
[184:09.45]Grab... Grab bows with your offhand.
[184:19.67]This is sick!
[184:25.34]Wait, hold on.
[184:38.29]That's fun.
[184:38.69]Emergency handgun.
[184:51.76]Does it have infinite ammo?
[184:54.02]It does.
[184:58.30]Oh wait, store weapon, move weapon, action, fire, spawn ammo, grab drop.
[185:03.08]All right, let's do it.
[185:04.12]I'm ready.
[185:04.46]This is fucking awesome.
[185:08.08]Switching to your pistol is always faster than reloading.
[185:11.86]Now let me do a stretch.
[185:14.22]Music by Speedblack.
[185:15.80]Enter the compound.
[185:18.16]I'm ready.
[185:18.46]Make sure I'm in the right spot.
[185:25.15]Practice area?
[185:25.87]Alright.
[185:26.11]Give me that emergency handgun.
[185:28.87]How do you store?
[185:30.17]Like that.
[185:30.75]Okay, so how do I pull it back out?
[185:33.03]Good to know.
[185:34.57]So I don't have to hold the grip.
[185:37.32]Actually, maybe I do.
[185:40.94]Maybe I do.
[185:41.34]Yeah, that's actually better, though.
[185:43.92]Okay, cool.
[185:45.42]Oh, there's the options.
[185:46.74]Mutation dispenser.
[185:48.19]I don't know what that is.
[185:50.75]Repair shower?
[185:57.25]Removes mutations.
[186:00.41]Let's just go.
[186:05.04]Underground sewers.
[186:11.73]Alright, can I get two handguns?
[186:25.06]This is awesome!
[186:26.50]This is awesome!
[186:40.01]Alright, good, good, good.
[186:40.69]Where we going?
[186:55.60]I need a gun!
[186:58.60]This is actually, like, the funnest VR game I've ever played.
[187:04.50]Okay, how do I- do I get ammo for it?
[187:11.38]Ammo.
[187:12.28]Map clear.
[187:14.32]Danger.
[187:14.70]Poisonous chemicals.
[187:15.47]Electric hazard.
[187:16.11]Join the core.
[187:16.87]Be a corpse.
[187:19.05]Oh, that's how you cycle.
[187:20.01]Okay.
[187:26.25]So I did it.
[187:27.49]Oh, shit.
[187:28.03]Alright.
[187:32.07]Sewer's level two.
[187:34.21]Hold on.
[187:38.07]We gotta spin around a few times.
[187:42.28]Alright, I'm ready.
[187:42.78]Holy shit, this is fun!
[187:55.65]This is fun.
[187:56.47]This is really fun.
[188:00.29]This is like what the guy that made Doom, like, wanted to make Doom.
[188:08.19]Profit before safety, okay?
[188:15.62]Nice.
[188:38.33]Nice.
[188:43.05]It feels so fluid too.
[188:44.25]This game is like super fluid.
[188:45.69]I love it.
[189:03.11]This is fantastic.
[189:12.81]Drink the game.
[189:14.65]This game actually looks pretty solid.
[189:16.09]Demented.
[189:18.37]Just got her.
[189:18.89]Is it wearing a corset?
[189:19.94]Yes.
[189:31.30]Map clear.
[189:31.82]Nice.
[189:32.10]Alright.
[189:38.64]Anything else I can do?
[189:39.42]Can I get like money or something?
[189:40.52]What should I do?
[189:44.08]He's waist training.
[189:46.94]Jerma, your voice is fucked.
[189:48.28]It's because I'm coming through a VR headset.
[189:55.85]Continue.
[189:56.27]Yeah, let's go.
[190:01.75]Reception and sales.
[190:05.13]They just double the price to remove the following side effects.
[190:08.87]Ichina's nausea balding brain damage.
[190:16.97]What do I do in here?
[190:22.96]M as staff only?
[190:26.58]Sell a family member.
[190:30.97]Uh, is this a store?
[190:36.01]Sales, huh.
[190:43.50]Is this like bullet movement?
[190:51.91]Where is he?
[191:05.79]What the fuck?
[191:12.47]Oh my god, he hit me in the head!
[191:13.67]Ooh, new weapon.
[191:21.19]Oh shit.
[191:24.70]Oh, shit.
[191:26.50]I can't take both?
[191:28.84]I can't.
[191:29.18]Alright, well, whatever.
[191:29.82]I don't need it.
[191:30.22]Let's go.
[191:36.40]Oh, fuck!
[191:37.78]It's the rail gun.
[191:38.74]Right.
[191:38.98]Oh, shit.
[191:44.12]Oh, shit.
[191:57.95]This is... Alright.
[191:59.11]Are there bosses in this game?
[192:00.37]Because if it is... Are there bosses?
[192:06.40]Railgun has a scope?
[192:08.36]Oh, shit.
[192:13.36]Use the scope.
[192:14.14]Alright.
[192:14.34]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[192:14.76]I see.
[192:19.51]Perception and sails 2.
[192:31.19]Maniac what?
[193:13.21]Oh my god!
[193:13.69]Did I get him?
[193:20.21]Brokers!
[193:20.75]Brokers!
[193:29.58]Holy shit!
[193:40.16]Alright, give me this ammo.
[193:45.91]Where's my actual health?
[193:46.85]Oh, shit.
[193:47.85]I have a thing here?
[193:48.90]Oh, that's cool.
[193:54.32]All right.
[194:05.26]Shit.
[194:09.59]Got him.
[194:19.76]I'm really into this.
[194:20.48]This is actually really fun.
[194:21.14]What happened?
[194:21.44]Did that guy die?
[194:21.78]Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[194:51.35]That was a collat?
[194:51.99]Yeah, that was fun.
[194:52.71]Alright, let's keep going.
[195:01.17]What does it say my ammo?
[195:03.43]Does it say my ammo somewhere?
[195:05.83]32-1-3.
[195:06.21]Okay.
[195:13.84]You accidentally put the game on easy.
[195:15.40]I did?
[195:16.78]When?
[195:19.84]I put it on the regular difficulty.
[195:20.90]What's our one?
[195:25.13]Vaccine.
[195:25.71]All right.
[195:26.85]This game's in early access still.
[195:28.27]That's really surprising, actually.
[195:55.27]Nothing over there.
[195:55.81]We're good.
[195:58.39]It's easy.
[195:59.65]It's early access, and yet it's still better than a lot of AAA games.
[196:02.15]I mean, this is fun.
[196:02.83]This is one of the sickest alpha games I've ever seen.
[196:07.12]This is alpha?
[196:09.18]I mean, this is really fun.
[196:12.26]If they're bosses, then this is like, I'm going to give it a pretty...
[196:28.90]That it?
[196:31.68]Holy fuck!
[196:33.92]Oh fuck!
[196:34.54]Oh fuck!
[196:35.20]Oh fuck!
[196:53.95]I kinda want a different gun.
[196:56.83]You know what?
[197:00.19]I want this.
[197:01.11]That thing's fun, but this one's better.
[197:15.22]Where we at?
[197:15.66]Okay, I gotta go this way.
[197:31.10]Hell yeah.
[197:31.92]Yes.
[197:39.93]Continue.
[197:40.43]Whoops.
[197:40.93]Don't leave that.
[197:42.81]That would have been really bad.
[197:43.69]It's drop time to stream.
[197:51.93]What?
[197:54.49]Up only.
[197:55.01]Where am I going?
[197:56.54]This place is pretty big.
[198:00.85]right through here holy shit okay oh my god it's the fucking thing from the terminator not the terminator the fucking the um robocop robocop robocop robocop robocop robocop robocop
[198:34.07]Give me this.
[198:34.65]Eat the hot dogs.
[198:47.68]We good?
[198:59.09]Suspicious, including women, children, elderly.
[199:01.87]All right, we're good.
[199:06.65]Cat puke.
[199:14.30]I want that.
[199:24.91]Oh, shit.
[199:25.39]It hurt.
[199:28.21]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[199:34.39]Oh, fuck.
[199:43.58]This is a gamer game, I'm telling you.
[199:52.20]This bullet lead too?
[199:55.98]Oh, that hurt.
[199:59.11]Where we going?
[200:09.97]I missed something over here.
[200:14.04]What did I miss over here?
[200:14.82]There's like a hidden thing right here?
[200:22.09]What is this?
[200:23.17]Oh, nothing.
[200:30.65]Gamer game.
[200:31.49]There's no bosses on easy.
[200:33.01]Can you do a weld?
[200:34.64]I think it would be hard to move and do a weld.
[200:36.52]Actually, maybe not.
[200:37.48]Because I can move with the right stick too.
[200:43.20]I'll try it.
[200:55.48]Oh, shit.
[201:04.35]Oh, God.
[201:04.71]This is going to be hard.
[201:13.58]I'll give it a try.
[201:14.12]I can only shoot him a couple times, though.
[201:24.09]Not worth it.
[201:41.21]Give me that burger I haven't gone this way.
[201:59.89]Let's go straight.
[202:00.43]Oh
[202:13.97]Sick.
[202:14.49]Alright.
[202:15.29]Good.
[202:19.25]The contrast between now and Sniper Elite.
[202:23.84]I mean, Sniper Elite is... That game is more precise.
[202:28.76]This is more about moving around fast.
[202:36.45]That's it, right?
[202:38.45]It is.
[202:38.71]Let's go.
[202:43.34]Try a harder difficulty?
[202:45.12]Weapon unlocked, laser pistol.
[202:47.94]I'll up the difficulty if I can after this.
[202:53.83]I feel like this is going to be probably a boss.
[202:55.23]Number one priority.
[203:01.91]Oh my god!
[203:03.13]Wrong way, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!
[203:04.83]Wrong, wrong, wrong!
[203:26.50]Who's calling?
[203:27.00]God damn.
[203:57.09]Sorry, I'm being like a silent gamer right now.
[203:58.93]This is, sorry.
[204:01.21]There's no commentary, just weird guy in VR with like a big ass plays compound.
[204:05.54]All right, this is a huge level.
[204:28.36]Should I go down?
[204:29.02]I'm thinking I'll probably go up.
[204:40.69]We clear?
[204:44.35]I guess I should investigate.
[204:45.43]There's nothing else in here, really.

[240:45.98]Because that's the announcement of the thing.
[240:47.54]That's not the thing.
[240:48.56]That's the announcement of the thing.
[240:51.89]But August is going to be huge.
[240:53.83]Got a lot of interesting stuff going on in August.
[240:57.19]And I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[240:59.35]Not Catboy Stream 2.
[241:04.45]And it's also not Grotto Beasts.
[241:06.05]Let me make that very clear.
[241:08.71]That's also a thing.
[241:14.45]This is different.
[241:18.33]Oh, that was a lot of fun, though.
[241:22.21]Thanks for watching.
[241:24.94]Compound was awesome.
[241:25.98]I just wish I could move around and play it.
[241:29.84]No, nobody's pregnant.
[241:42.77]Let me rate the games I played.
[241:46.03]Space Channel 5 VR was an 8.7 out of 10.
[241:50.89]It would have been like a 9.
[241:52.59]It would have been like an 8.
[241:53.89]No, it would have been like a 7.7.
[241:56.77]But, I mean, like Miko.
[241:58.15]You know what I mean?
[242:02.52]Sniper Elite VR was probably like an A, but I just couldn't handle it, so I'm going to give it like a C+.
[242:11.84]Then, Compound was an A+.
[242:17.93]What was between that?
[242:19.49]What else did I do?
[242:23.63]What was the third game?
[242:28.02]L.A.
[242:28.16]Noire.
[242:28.54]Oh, right.
[242:28.98]That would have been so much fun.
[242:31.66]I would have stayed in that.
[242:37.12]Then, obviously, Tilt Brush is like 5 out of 5.
[242:43.93]So, on Sunday, we'll probably open with...
