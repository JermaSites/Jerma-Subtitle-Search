[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.51]Wait, some of you guys got an ad for Spider-Man?
[00:06.56]Well, that's relevant.
[00:09.88]Wait, I'm not supposed to be here yet.
[00:11.02]Hold on.
[00:12.42]I'm not supposed to be here yet.
[00:49.37]Okay, now you can pull back the curtain.
[00:51.65]And I'm standing there.
[00:54.23]And I freeze.
[00:55.63]I have an entire act planned for you guys.
[00:58.15]I've been rehearsing it for months.
[01:02.99]In my mirror.
[01:04.79]At dress rehearsals.
[01:07.30]The curtain comes back on opening night.
[01:09.28]I puked in the trash can already.
[01:13.26]And then here it comes.
[01:14.12]It's my juggling and my fucking comedy act.
[01:18.23]I can't even start juggling.
[01:19.23]I don't know how to do it.
[01:20.09]I forget how.
[01:25.79]And I walk off the stage while everyone's booing.
[01:30.00]It's a rehearsed stream.
[01:31.36]No, not today.
[01:34.42]Anyways, yes, we're going to play some more Spider-Man.
[01:38.88]I must admit to you, today is kind of a...
[01:44.82]Kind of a stressful day today.
[01:47.32]For no reason other than I wake up migraine sometimes.
[01:51.83]And then really fuck with my head.
[01:54.57]And it's one of those migraines today where if I make loud noises, if I cough, the whole right side of my head hurts.
[02:03.40]If I go like this, talk this loud, that's fine.
[02:06.52]Talk this loud, that's getting a little close.
[02:08.38]But if I go, there it is again.
[02:11.50]So I can't make any loud noises.
[02:13.48]I can't scream today.
[02:15.04]This is actually probably a good thing.
[02:18.54]I won't be one of those screamers.
[02:23.10]But also on top of that, this is not necessarily a stressful thing, but it's a thing that I just got like 45 minutes ago.
[02:32.80]The agreement, the actual set in stone agreement for the move to Vegas was emailed to me.
[02:41.06]So I just have to sign... I didn't get really... I read a portion of it.
[02:44.62]I didn't sign it yet.
[02:46.62]But it was real before, but now it's legal.
[02:50.78]Right?
[02:52.91]Well, not yet.
[02:53.57]I have to sign it first.
[02:55.73]So there's that.
[02:58.65]It's legal now.
[03:01.55]Could have been an illegal move.
[03:05.91]Sign it on stream.
[03:08.54]I don't think I'm going to do that.
[03:11.22]But, let's move over here.
[03:13.04]Welcome again to Spider-Man.
[03:16.22]We are only 47% through the game.
[03:18.90]Which, if you judge by the last two streams, it seems to be with all the side content, all the dicking around, and the story missions, we seem to be doing about 25% a day.
[03:30.16]So, if you were to say loud... 20% is the side content.
[03:39.65]That's true.
[03:41.33]but full story is like 70%.
[03:45.73]We might get there.
[03:46.81]Oh, this is loud.
[03:49.49]I don't know why the music's so loud.
[03:52.48]We may get there tonight.
[03:53.44]We'll see how we go.
[03:59.06]If we don't finish Spider-Man tonight, then we will have, obviously, something to talk about there.
[04:06.85]If you'd like to see it again, if you want me to finish it.
[04:09.29]Do you guys want me to finish this game on stream?
[04:12.50]Like story-wise, like actually get to the end of the game?
[04:19.75]Yeah, I might as well, right?
[04:22.79]I'm not going to do all the side content, but we'll try to get to the end of the game tonight.
[04:27.89]And if we don't, then I'll do it again tomorrow.
[04:32.23]This is like the week of Spider-Man.
[04:36.93]What the hell is this?
[04:39.73]Oh, I thought I had an old-timey airline pilot outfit on.
[04:43.71]I thought I had airline goggles on.
[04:44.97]I was like, what the fuck is this?
[04:45.93]The year of Spider-Man.
[04:47.29]Talk about Gwen.
[04:48.15]I'm only halfway through the story.
[05:00.25]Well, yeah, so whatever.
[05:02.83]If we don't finish it tonight, then we're just going to do it again tomorrow.
[05:07.58]So we're going to just go straight through here in a row, day to day, until we finish the game.
[05:13.40]That might be tonight, that might be an hour or two tomorrow, and then we'll just chill for like an hour or something.
[05:20.38]Anywho, welcome back to Spider-Man.
[05:24.04]My name is too loud.
[05:25.04]That hurt.
[05:25.66]My name is too... That's a little... I gotta get the right... My name is Jerma985.
[05:29.34]Welcome.
[05:30.62]Audio level here.
[05:34.06]My name is Jerma985.
[05:36.28]Welcome.
[05:36.86]Welcome.
[05:37.52]My name is Jerma985.
[05:39.00]Welcome back to Spider-Man.
[05:41.20]That was fine.
[05:41.68]That didn't hurt.
[05:42.08]You have a very loud name.
[05:52.96]That's some good cider.
[05:57.06]Oh, man, that's a shattered spine.
[06:00.08]Let's go this way.
[06:00.60]Let's go right to the story mission, because I just feel like... Wait, no, I did it already.
[06:09.22]Not to slow down.
[06:09.86]I already got it.
[06:13.22]I have beautiful teeth.
[06:16.32]No, no, not anymore.
[06:18.52]I gotta go to the dentist, man.
[06:19.84]That's another thing I have to write off the list here.
[06:24.44]I have a giant list of all the things I have to do before October 1st.
[06:28.75]It's like three months worth of stuff to do.
[06:31.71]I haven't done it.
[06:33.01]I've done a lot of it, but not all of it.
[06:37.71]There's a lot of things to do to get out of here.
[06:39.36]I have to change the bank account information.
[06:49.04]I have to turn off the electricity.
[06:50.24]I have to turn off the gas.
[06:53.30]I got to call my lawyer and tell him he's fucking fired.
[06:57.85]You can't be my lawyer across the country.
[06:59.65]I'm not comfortable with that.
[07:01.33]You're fired.
[07:03.51]And then he's going to try to come with me.
[07:05.71]He's going to be like, but hold on a second.
[07:06.99]No, Jeremy, I could come with you.
[07:08.85]I'm going to be like, ah, like I don't have I don't have an answer.
[07:12.33]I don't have an excuse.
[07:14.36]Um told him you want to come you coming with yeah.
[07:17.24]Yeah, I'm going to buy a place in Nevada as well.
[07:20.44]Oh Fuck I don't have a reason to say no to you, but I have to I can be part of your streamer house.
[07:26.34]Oh And I'll pay all the bills Oh
[07:42.24]Yeah, well, god damn it.
[07:45.74]No, man.
[07:48.38]Direct neural interface.
[07:51.42]Current response time, 5.7 milliseconds.
[07:53.71]Target response time.
[07:54.65]So, is this a leaderboard thing?
[07:57.23]Is that who currently is in first place?
[07:59.51]At 5.7?
[07:59.91]Okay, looks like I could optimize this power relay.
[08:05.65]Say it's only a two-bedroom.
[08:07.07]It's me and Etalyx.
[08:08.69]Oh, I can sleep in your bed.
[08:13.35]At the end of the bed like a dog.
[08:15.77]Ugh.
[08:15.89]Oh, not one of these.
[08:22.64]My head hurts too much to do this one.
[08:24.24]No, it doesn't.
[08:24.94]I can do it.
[08:26.78]Let's see.
[08:27.20]We need to do... What's target voltage one?
[08:30.50]So... It has to be this one.
[08:35.94]Right?
[08:36.18]Because...
[08:38.21]There's really no option there.
[08:40.09]I'm not going to do +2.
[08:41.21]There's no negatives here.
[08:43.05]Alright, let's go... I'm going to say let's go straight down.
[08:46.89]No, I'm not going to say that.
[08:47.89]We're going to go this way.
[08:48.99]No, we're not going to do that either.
[08:50.43]I need those.
[08:52.17]I need the special ones.
[08:52.97]There we go.
[08:53.57]Now this one.
[08:55.53]So there's the plus one.
[08:57.85]Which then should be able to... We should be able to grade us this way.
[09:03.54]Then we go... Well...
[09:10.88]And then we go up.
[09:11.78]Can we go up this way?
[09:13.40]I already ruined it.
[09:17.61]Maybe not.
[09:18.59]Let's see.
[09:21.87]I think I got it.
[09:26.29]Yeah, I got it.
[09:29.73]Peter, you're a genius, Peter.
[09:31.62]Oh, wait a minute.
[09:31.98]4.9.
[09:32.00]Alright, I got it.
[09:41.96]I increased my... my PB.
[09:43.97]Alright, more calibration.
[09:49.01]Oh fuck, I gotta do this like three times.
[09:51.77]Uh, this is locked.
[09:53.41]So it does not go that way.
[09:55.77]Target voltage is four, which then is... I can't... this is locked.
[09:59.94]And so is this.
[10:03.14]So that means we have to have this go through.
[10:05.04]This is gonna be six, five... I need minus one.
[10:11.11]But don't ask me how the hell this is supposed to go through here.
[10:13.01]So this has to go down.
[10:13.99]Nope.
[10:16.57]Like this.
[10:19.67]And then across.
[10:22.35]And then this has to go up through both of these.
[10:27.13]Hold on a second here.
[10:31.66]I can't move.
[10:32.32]I can move this one, but it has to go up through this.
[10:37.24]I can't change that.
[10:40.11]No, it doesn't.
[10:40.57]It doesn't have to do that at all.
[10:43.71]Just bypass it.
[10:54.62]Okay, whatever.
[10:58.00]Yeah, I thought you had to go through the locked ones or something.
[11:01.71]I don't know, my brain was trying to say, it's locked, we have to go through it, it's there for a reason.
[11:07.51]Signal to noise is out of whack.
[11:08.93]A new signal processor should reduce lag.
[11:12.73]How did Otto fuck this up so badly?
[11:14.86]I don't know.
[11:19.18]Who's the real scientist here?
[11:20.48]Okay, so we got target is five.
[11:25.35]Locked, locked, locked.
[11:28.43]So these have to be not necessarily used, but... Alright, so target is five.
[11:33.39]Um...
[11:35.59]I don't know here.
[11:36.11]So let's do... Let's put two... No, no, no.
[11:39.13]Let's put... If I do -2, that's negative two.
[11:45.25]And then come through here, which would be plus... That'd be zero.
[11:50.84]So zero going through here.
[11:54.08]And then... +2.
[11:59.58]+2.
[12:00.22]Shit, no.
[12:00.96]Is there a minus four?
[12:01.98]Oh, goddammit.
[12:07.94]Let me just get it to work first, and then... Let me connect all the dots, and then we can play with math later.
[12:14.86]Let's go this way, Beater.
[12:17.22]That's not right.
[12:20.92]You know what I'm saying?
[12:21.48]We can fuck with the math problem later.
[12:22.98]Because that's negative one, and that's... We'll do it... Whatever, we'll figure it out later.
[12:34.14]I also have to go up there.
[12:35.32]Are there even enough pieces to do that?
[12:40.97]I have no idea.
[12:45.37]Okay, let's do this one.
[12:47.23]That's not correct.
[12:49.62]That's not going to happen.
[12:51.12]So this has to go up.
[12:53.62]Hold on.
[12:54.18]Up and then down?
[12:55.34]Aye, aye, aye.
[13:05.60]So that's minus 2.
[13:07.92]So this is now negative 1.
[13:11.08]Let me just piece this together first.
[13:13.10]I don't think it's going to make it.
[13:19.34]It kind of is.
[13:21.07]No, it is.
[13:21.45]Ah, damn it.
[13:26.99]Okay.
[13:32.79]So now we can mess with the math here.
[13:37.90]Got it.
[13:42.68]Response time, 2.8.
[13:43.94]Peter, you've done it.
[13:47.71]Today is National Video Game Day?
[13:51.59]Really?
[13:57.29]Happy birthday.
[13:58.41]We have huge bits here.
[14:04.24]Let's cover him after the cutscene here.
[14:05.68]Thank you so much to Squirds, first of all.
[14:09.66]$50.
[14:09.68]50 bucks.
[14:16.75]Uh-oh.
[14:24.16]Hovering over the stop.
[14:27.02]Just, oh god, this could go real ugly.
[14:41.23]That's so scary.
[14:47.05]Hmm.
[14:47.43]Now, if only I had six more of these.
[14:49.70]Yes!
[15:00.56]See, he's just making fun of me now.
[15:10.31]I told the story, but I couldn't juggle in front of the audience.
[15:18.34]I would press the stop button right now.
[15:19.56]Because it's my turn.
[15:29.19]I'd call that a mild success.
[15:30.99]I'd call that unbelievable.
[15:32.35]Uh-oh.
[15:34.95]I can't take it off.
[15:38.21]Do you need some help?
[15:40.22]Yes.
[15:51.77]I don't want to get out of the virtual reality world.
[15:55.39]It's become that obvious.
[15:59.23]My doctors call it a degenerative neurological disorder.
[16:03.95]Probably caused by overexposure to toxic chemicals in my reckless youth.
[16:08.26]Jesus.
[16:09.36]Sorry, is there anything I can do?
[16:11.24]You already are.
[16:13.36]The worst part is, it only affects the muscles.
[16:17.88]The mind continues to work, but it can no longer do.
[16:26.08]You're the only one who knows, Peter.
[16:27.54]I'd like to keep it that way.
[16:30.69]Of course.
[16:32.19]If you'd like to seek a position with more of a future... I came here to work for you because of what you've got up here.
[16:43.78]And that's not going anywhere.
[16:47.39]So neither am I.
[16:58.40]Well, it's gonna be real sad when he turns.
[17:00.70]I'll take a look.
[17:01.66]Thanks, Doc.
[17:16.89]Spoilers.
[17:17.63]Yeah, spoilers, guys.
[17:18.69]Dr. Otto.
[17:18.95]I don't- I hate to say this, but... I talked too loud.
[17:21.21]Otto Octavius.
[17:23.17]Ooh, subtle.
[17:23.69]Stop.
[17:23.85]Spoiled.
[17:45.51]That's like saying Green Goblin is Norman Osborn.
[17:50.22]Did you just time travel from the Stone Age?
[17:52.12]Were you in the sofa with a bunch of coins?
[17:55.06]Did somebody pull you out and buy a coffee with you?
[17:58.50]Me and you, Spider-Man.
[18:16.76]Alright, well that's interesting.
[18:21.28]Are you coming by today?
[18:22.56]Strong connections.
[18:24.48]Talk main.
[18:25.04]That worked, Dr. Peter.
[18:26.93]That's like saying Peter Parker is Spider-Man.
[18:29.55]Well, that's the funny thing.
[18:30.49]If you saw my title, that's his cover.
[18:46.64]Peter Parker is Spider-Man, but Peter Parker is his made-up stage name.
[18:51.74]Scott Spindleman is the actual... Anyway, Squirds.
[18:59.88]Squirds, thank you for the $50, dude.
[19:03.42]And they say, Red Star Badge thingy, yay.
[19:06.28]Love you, Jerma.
[19:07.00]I left a bits message earlier, so this one will be shorter.
[19:10.86]You're a great inspiration for me.
[19:12.12]Maybe one day I'll set my mind to do what I really want to do in life.
[19:15.52]Thanks again.
[19:18.28]Well, whatever it is that you are trying to achieve, man.
[19:22.29]I wish you the best.
[19:23.81]And thank you so much for that incredibly nice fucking best.
[19:27.85]Squirts, thank you again for the $50.
[19:30.15]I wish you the best in any of your... in all of your endeavors.
[19:45.08]Bye, Spider-Man.
[19:47.15]I mean Peter Parker.
[19:49.23]Why does everybody say Peter Parker?
[19:50.71]It's just Pete, right?
[19:55.14]Hey, Pete.
[19:56.28]Peter.
[19:56.94]You've no doubt heard about the riot at Empire Stadium.
[20:00.74]This is not your usual toxic mix.
[20:03.64]Underage drinking, entitled millennials, and hormones run rampant.
[20:09.05]Authorities are keeping a tight lid on the situation, but my sources tell me the demons
[20:16.44]I'll tell you, I don't like wearing this suit right now.
[20:23.17]It's nothing to do with aesthetic.
[20:24.37]It's nothing to do with what it looks like.
[20:25.83]No.
[20:26.93]It's just hot out right now.
[20:28.07]Just look at how it's so sunny.
[20:29.23]This would be unbearable.
[20:35.07]This is not good.
[20:36.05]I have to change this.
[20:37.35]You can see the steam coming off me.
[20:40.67]This is bad.
[20:41.43]I'm fucking steaming right now.
[20:42.95]I'm gonna die in this suit.
[20:51.36]Oh, there's a new one.
[20:53.82]Cool.
[20:57.46]Create a distortion field that can obscure you from non-alerted enemies' vision.
[21:02.99]So you can kind of just walk by people.
[21:04.39]That's cool.
[21:07.21]What's the one that has the air conditioning inside?
[21:11.67]These are all so hot.
[21:15.88]This one looks like it could have AC in it.
[21:19.34]That one looks like
[21:21.52]It could have air conditioning.
[21:25.85]Classic suit repaired.
[21:29.89]We actually have not even used this.
[21:31.19]Web blossom.
[21:31.77]Leap into the air and web everything in sight.
[21:33.47]Alright, let's put on the classic air conditioned Spider-Man suit.
[21:40.41]What's the suit power?
[21:44.62]Okay, that's... What's the range on that bad boy, huh?
[21:51.36]Any new gadgets?
[21:53.10]What about... Can I upgrade any of these?
[21:56.11]Not that one.
[21:56.77]Nope.
[21:59.97]Nope.
[22:00.87]I got new skills, though.
[22:03.51]Activewear.
[22:04.95]Yeah, I just said breathable.
[22:05.95]I don't like watching him jump around in a black leather suit.
[22:13.47]Only one of these is worth one, and it's this one.
[22:15.31]Hold R2 plus X while running or standing to build up a charge, then release it for a huge leap.
[22:24.77]What?
[22:30.67]Charge jump.
[22:31.43]Can I queue this up in the air?
[22:32.77]Let's see.
[22:36.01]I guess maybe not.
[22:45.75]I guess I can start that off and then go from here to there.
[22:48.37]Okay, I see.
[22:48.97]I guess it's only to start when you run.
[22:57.48]Can't really do much.
[22:59.40]Actually, I kind of don't like that move now.
[23:01.72]If I could charge that up while in the air, like while I'm falling or something, and then just be able to launch back up, that'd be cool.
[23:11.53]Alright, let's go.
[23:12.45]That's a jumping spider.
[23:18.08]play Spider-Man 2.
[23:21.08]I already have played Spider-Man 2.
[23:22.46]It's a good game.
[23:32.35]You could change and charge it in Spider-Man 2.
[23:34.31]Game confirmed sucks.
[23:35.63]That guy has white blood.
[23:42.51]Oh, shit.
[23:44.24]Look at all the blood.
[23:49.16]No, it's not.
[23:53.10]It's water.
[23:54.12]I know it wasn't blood.
[24:02.23]No, guys, we're playing the Jerma version of the game.
[24:04.25]Don't you understand?
[24:05.59]You know how they do that?
[24:15.25]Jerma versions of the game, they have like white powder pop out of people.
[24:42.64]Didn't that happen in Left 4 Dead as well?
[24:44.28]Like, powder would pop out of people when you shot them, right?
[24:49.62]You're Spider-Man.
[24:51.30]You're the amazing Spider-Man.
[24:53.27]You're the spectacular Spider-Man.
[24:54.73]And a few other choice adjectives Jameson uses.
[24:57.09]Look, that was really brave.
[24:59.19]But next time, leave the fighting to the pros.
[25:01.97]Okay?
[25:03.11]Okay, but what if there aren't any around?
[25:06.96]well you can't just go swinging at someone twice your size I mean don't get me wrong I fight guys stronger than me all the time but when I do it I have oh like that time you fought right on the Brooklyn bridge no it's a fan perfect example if the other guy is bigger you got to be quicker okay okay but that's it's easy for you to say I sorry I just can't do what you do
[25:32.25]Alright, put him up.
[25:34.27]Seriously?
[25:34.57]Yeah, come on.
[25:36.53]This is great.
[25:37.23]I'm gonna fight Spider-Man.
[25:41.09]Don't let the adrenaline get to you.
[25:42.83]Breathe slow.
[25:44.27]Breathe deep.
[25:44.73]Alright, let's fucking go.
[25:46.35]Hip square to your opponent.
[25:48.74]Let them make the first move.
[25:50.48]Now use your feet, and when they go off balance, look for an opening.
[25:53.98]Boom.
[25:54.88]Like that?
[25:55.22]Yeah.
[25:55.76]Yeah, that's it.
[25:56.52]Okay.
[25:56.70]Not only this time, just let me have it.
[25:59.24]Right on the jock.
[26:00.20]Okay?
[26:00.78]I can do it.
[26:03.85]Sorry.
[26:04.85]No, no.
[26:06.91]It's all good.
[26:08.49]Cut to, like, him going in the back of an ambulance.
[26:12.71]Spider-Man's got, like, a fucking broken jaw.
[26:14.41]Hey!
[26:17.00]Thanks.
[26:18.18]You know... Anytime.
[26:19.12]I just punched Spider-Man.
[26:34.36]Oh, now we're playing as Miles.
[26:35.46]Okay.
[26:36.86]Shelter should be just ahead.
[26:43.95]Yo Miles, what's up?
[26:44.88]Bro, you're not gonna believe this.
[26:46.68]I just met Spider-Man.
[26:48.16]What?
[26:49.34]That's crazy.
[26:49.72]I punched him in the face.
[26:51.60]Oh, man.
[26:53.20]I totally forgot.
[26:54.10]You suck.
[26:55.54]He totally would have bought it off you, and then you'd be, like, famous.
[26:58.41]Yeah, I'll show him next time.
[27:00.39]I gotta go.
[27:00.97]I promised my mom I wouldn't be late.
[27:02.91]Cool.
[27:03.37]Later.
[27:04.01]Keep moving.
[27:05.45]Keep moving.
[27:07.79]What's this?
[27:08.13]Hacking app unlocked.
[27:09.67]Tourism adapt.
[27:14.79]They don't mind me.
[27:15.61]I'm just gonna stand here and hack your radio.
[27:25.56]They're happy!
[27:27.46]They're really happy that I just hacked their radio.
[27:34.23]By the way, that's the only song that will ever play.
[27:37.91]Good luck with your $445 beach stereo.
[27:45.97]It only plays Selena Gomez now.
[27:47.67]Good luck.
[27:49.29]This is kind of fun.
[27:50.11]Ooh, okay.
[27:50.91]Sneak past the drone.
[27:52.99]Okay.
[28:08.14]Alright, now what?
[28:09.58]Am I gonna go this way?
[28:11.50]Uh... I made it, right?
[28:13.08]Is that it?
[28:13.70]Why am I still in sneak mode?
[28:14.98]Oh.
[28:15.12]Oh, fuck.
[28:15.76]Okay, I get it.
[28:16.12]I thought I was just gonna get by.
[28:38.82]How am I gonna get by this guy?
[28:41.68]Oh, like that.
[28:42.82]Oh, God damn it!
[28:44.22]I thought it was... I thought it was... He stopped in the middle!
[28:46.46]Fuck!
[28:46.74]He stopped right in the middle.
[28:47.60]I thought he was walking by.
[28:49.12]Sorry, I'll be right there in front of that screen.
[28:57.04]Yeah, that's awkward.
[28:57.50]Okay.
[28:59.45]That's probably a good idea.
[29:19.13]Where do you stop?
[29:23.79]Where does he go?
[29:24.55]I need to, like, watch where he goes.
[29:26.23]See?
[29:26.45]That's what happened.
[29:27.01]He stopped right... I thought he was going to keep going all the way to the right.
[29:32.42]I don't think I can go around here.
[29:37.19]I mean, I just, are there more things for me to hack?
[29:39.93]Is there something to hack over here?
[29:44.37]Oh God, okay.
[29:45.31]I can hack, what is that?
[29:46.35]Is that like trash?
[29:47.33]I can like hack the trash.
[29:53.62]Okay, let's see.
[29:54.34]I can go under the gate on the left or over the scaffolding to the right.
[30:05.31]We're going up.
[30:08.29]Your choices matter.
[30:14.49]I was about to say be careful of the painting stuff.
[30:16.91]Because there's a lot of stuff to knock over up here.
[30:18.45]There's a drone.
[30:25.61]Come on, hack it.
[30:27.97]Hack it.
[30:30.47]What's the opportunity when it goes up and around?
[30:33.76]Comes straight through.
[30:34.48]And it goes up and around.
[30:36.34]I have to hack it.
[30:43.10]What?
[30:43.54]Oh my god!
[30:44.82]Hack it, hack it, hack it, hack it!
[30:46.42]Those things have mounted guns?
[30:48.90]Can't let them spot me.
[30:54.02]Alright, box is over here.
[30:55.02]Can I... Oh my fucking god!
[30:59.47]What?
[30:59.77]No!
[31:02.05]Ow, my head!
[31:11.16]Throw the pager?
[31:11.98]I don't have a pager.
[31:14.72]I didn't even notice the other one came around this way.
[31:16.38]I get it.
[31:17.80]Those things have mounted guns?
[31:19.14]I can't let them spot me.
[31:23.16]Why would you look over here?
[31:28.30]Why would you look this way?
[31:30.98]Why?
[31:31.36]What?
[31:39.51]There was Sparks and explosions, so he turns over to me.
[31:41.91]And now I'm stuck.
[31:45.83]Now we have to go this way.
[31:47.79]Stay over there.
[32:12.43]Oh, that's fucking broken goddamn glass.
[32:16.85]Oh, god damn it!
[32:20.51]Oh, wait, he doesn't even know I'm here.
[32:21.91]Then he can't even see me.
[32:24.65]He can't see me.
[32:25.17]I have to jump between... Hack it!
[32:33.01]Fuck these stupid stealth missions, man.
[32:39.23]You're flying around New York City and all of a sudden it's like, don't be careful, don't step on the glass.
[32:46.30]Running a sweep.
[32:47.36]We'll report status.
[33:15.23]Oh my god
[33:42.44]That was tense.
[33:46.33]Oh, hey, Mom.
[33:48.19]Hi, honey.
[33:48.93]Did you make it to the feast shelter okay?
[33:51.37]Uh, yeah, almost there.
[33:52.97]Miles, you don't have to work in that shelter, you know.
[33:56.94]You said I did.
[33:59.25]I would rather just wait as in line.
[34:00.53]What was the point of that?
[34:01.35]I'll tell you.
[34:01.73]To add 15 minutes to the game.
[34:02.53]That's it.
[34:03.83]That's it.
[34:04.09]That's it.
[34:27.79]Almost there.
[34:28.91]Can't take a detour now.
[34:29.89]I'm going the wrong way.
[34:34.49]Does Miles have a camera too?
[34:35.69]No.
[34:41.28]Use the crosswalk.
[34:42.32]Hack his guitar.
[34:55.80]There are no crosswalks in New York?
[34:57.80]That was so funny.
[34:58.66]I wish they did it, but they didn't.
[35:25.77]I wish he had a big welt on his mouth where he punched him.
[35:30.27]He's holding a bag of ice up to his face.
[35:33.50]Oh, yeah.
[35:34.32]Make yourself at home, man.
[35:35.48]Coffee.
[35:36.26]Thanks.
[35:39.44]What happened to your face?
[35:40.89]Ah.
[35:41.87]You know.
[35:42.17]Unless you know what the hell a cork is.
[35:43.67]Somebody punched me in the face.
[35:44.99]It's a subatomic particle.
[35:47.63]You know, the building block of protons, neutrons, hadrons.
[35:52.85]Subatomic.
[35:54.61]It fits.
[35:56.21]Good one, kid.
[35:58.07]Piece of junk.
[36:00.12]The hell?
[36:02.78]Damn hunk of junk.
[36:05.48]You mind if I take a look?
[36:06.86]Huh?
[36:08.20]Oh, we have a couple of CRTs at school.
[36:10.00]I know how to fix these when they're... CR what?
[36:11.70]No, no.
[36:12.15]You just gotta smack it.
[36:14.09]Time.
[36:15.09]Get it.
[36:17.40]Boomer.
[36:17.78]It said boomer.
[36:18.58]Oh, my God.
[36:33.76]Tributes continue to pour in for Officer Jefferson Davis, the hero killed in the City Hall bombing, as reports emerged that he used his own body to shield others in his last moments of life.
[36:44.85]Hey, new kid.
[36:45.95]I'm empty here.
[36:47.41]Hero.
[36:48.87]Man didn't do nothing heroic except get himself blown up.
[36:54.89]Hey, Ernie.
[36:56.91]I see you've met Miles.
[36:58.26]Jesus Christ.
[36:58.72]He's gonna be helping out around here.
[37:00.52]You may have heard of his father, Jefferson Davis?
[37:05.20]Pretty great that even though he's got a lot of stuff going on right now, he decided to come and volunteer.
[37:10.00]Don't you think?
[37:11.40]Yeah, yeah.
[37:14.22]Thanks.
[37:17.16]Listen, Kat, I'm sorry about your dad.
[37:21.11]Come on, Miles.
[37:23.97]See if Aunt May needs a hand in the kitchen.
[37:27.08]Am I changing characters to him?
[37:28.84]Oh, that would have been so weird.
[37:32.02]Now I'm playing as that guy.
[37:36.60]They did the two characters walk off, slow zoom in, third person thing.
[37:40.02]Of course.
[37:54.35]Those look good.
[37:54.75]Those bananas, though, I mean, mmm, those might be a couple days overripe.
[37:58.15]Aunt May's been trying to cut the same carrot for four or five straight days.
[38:00.53]At some point, someone's gonna have to tell her that that's a ceramic display carrot, May.
[38:26.00]To put it down.
[38:27.24]Alright, let's go.
[38:29.98]It's a hologram carrot.
[38:43.56]I could go for a big juicy apple right now.
[38:49.25]One that you bite into it and it just explodes in your mouth.
[38:53.57]Damn.
[38:54.33]Too bad.
[39:01.25]Or a pear.
[39:03.51]You know, I want a pear that's just about to be rotten.
[39:06.77]You guys know what I'm talking about?
[39:07.61]An overripe pear is... You can't compare to that.
[39:18.22]Some people know what I'm saying here, and they get it.
[39:21.54]I'm seeing a lot of disgusted faces, but an overripe pear...
[39:26.73]Oh, it's so delicious and sugary and it's so easy to bite into.
[39:34.60]The flesh just tears off the bone.
[39:35.70]I guess I'm saying the core in the middle.
[39:36.62]That's the bone.
[39:44.00]Are you ready for a real legitimate complaint of the game?
[39:55.12]I have not had any so far.
[39:57.46]Zero.
[39:58.66]I think this is one of the best games of the year, right?
[40:02.55]And I know you can turn them off, right?
[40:06.79]You can just delete all the stealth missions.
[40:10.19]Right?
[40:12.47]Is that true?
[40:13.17]So you have a complaint.
[40:14.43]We'll talk about it in a minute.
[40:16.03]Alright, we have a second to talk about it.
[40:36.72]When you're moving around so quickly in a game like this, stopping and needing to walk and sneak around, mandatory, I think is a major mistake.
[40:54.75]But I don't think it is mandatory.
[40:55.73]I'm pretty sure you can turn it off.
[41:09.78]Now, that does not drop this game like a full letter grade or anything.
[41:13.37]It's just an observation that when you're hyperactively moving around, flying through New York, it's hard to go from that to... Whoa!
[41:26.44]Hit the brakes!
[41:27.62]I mean, really hit the brakes and go as slow as possible.
[41:39.86]Oh, there he is, Mr. Negative.
[41:44.22]So if this is Mr. Negative, is there a Mr. Positive?
[41:52.90]And is he really happy and really nice?
[41:55.14]And completely overblown with colors?
[42:16.53]And... Here we go.
[42:17.75]Catch the truck.
[42:18.33]Oh, no, hey, wait, Spider-Man, you're supposed to be able to... Come on!
[42:21.19]Jumping two times.
[42:22.07]Wait, it went this way.
[42:22.83]They're going an illegal way.
[42:43.36]Oh my head Jesus Christ There will be no further warning
[43:07.41]Well, that kind of helped a little.
[43:10.69]Whoa, jump!
[43:11.19]No, I think they broke through.
[43:13.91]Throw them over.
[43:15.97]D'oh!
[43:34.49]I missed it hey stop shooting get over there what are you doing there we go alright stop the truck how many bad guys are in that truck too many you need to clear the guys in the trucks before I go after lee open fire
[44:02.24]And back to the other one?
[44:04.08]Can I go in?
[44:04.86]Oh, wow.
[44:09.30]Wait, what?
[44:13.05]I just decorated that guy's car for Halloween.
[44:15.65]That's it.
[44:15.89]That guy's going to like a fucking theme party.
[44:35.95]See you later He is coming and he will destroy all sinners Got the hot dog I can't believe he didn't drop the hot dog
[45:08.62]No, hold on, Spider-Man.
[45:11.37]I'm going to skate on this.
[45:17.67]That's not hot, buddy.
[45:19.53]Dude, you could cook a fried egg on the other side of that thing.
[45:21.89]I mean, that's how hot it is over there.
[45:23.25]Uh-oh.
[45:23.52]He's going to convert me.
[45:26.78]What are you doing to me?
[45:39.35]Giving you a new perspective.
[45:46.30]He just converted me.
[45:47.08]What the hell?
[45:49.42]I'm now one of those bad guys.
[45:50.56]I must be honest.
[45:51.92]I was hoping to bring you here.
[45:53.72]My abilities lend me a certain persuasiveness.
[46:01.39]I've been watching you.
[46:03.57]I was waiting for you at City Hall.
[46:05.75]You never came.
[46:16.26]story story story it was a shame so many had to die with no heroes to save them it was all where'd he go oh there he is
[46:47.78]That officer saved your life, didn't he?
[46:50.87]He was here because of you.
[46:57.55]I'm just gonna keep walking.
[46:58.51]I go to the corner.
[46:59.13]There's a light switch.
[47:00.89]It just says Mr. Negative on it.
[47:03.58]Just flick it.
[47:04.38]No, wait, don't do that!
[47:07.14]I come back to life and he's dead.
[47:23.41]Found the switch.
[47:24.37]And Norma wanted to use it.
[47:26.69]A futile gesture.
[47:28.99]And where was Norman during all this?
[47:32.05]Slinking.
[47:33.41]No, don't do that!
[47:34.59]He knew what was going to happen, and he fled.
[47:38.46]Norman is a hidden cancer on this city.
[47:41.52]He must be excised with no trace of his corruption to return.
[47:48.52]He's the green goblin.
[47:50.06]He's the green goblin.
[47:51.62]Is this a boss fight?
[48:19.10]I think this is the in-your-mind boss fight.
[48:20.96]Electric web.
[48:24.04]I'm gonna try to pay attention to the story.
[48:27.22]Alright.
[48:49.74]Alright, time to fight.
[48:50.52]Time to pay attention.
[48:54.70]What's one life?
[48:56.40]A simple trade.
[48:58.04]One life for a city of souls.
[49:00.86]You know what?
[49:07.96]Fuck it.
[49:08.58]Let's do it.
[49:10.84]You defend Osborn while he sits in his ivory tower?
[49:15.53]This isn't real.
[49:17.41]Show me your true strength.
[49:20.58]I'll show it to you.
[49:22.44]You're gonna show me yours, though.
[49:25.60]Oh, there he is.
[49:26.80]Oh, he showed it to me, alright.
[49:28.10]I don't think he will.
[49:32.05]Whoa, uh...
[49:47.24]Okay Destroy the mass Did I just like save the guy?
[50:20.00]No, I didn't.
[50:25.44]The guy.
[50:26.02]I just saved the guy.
[50:28.98]Oh, I'm sorry.
[50:32.70]You re-reconverted me.
[50:36.51]Yeah, I turned the switch on and turned it off.
[50:54.29]There's a note in there.
[50:57.77]We're just holding our hands together for ten minutes, probably.
[51:04.52]You're a popular guy.
[51:19.49]Just a few pop figurines.
[51:21.59]Pretty rare, though.
[51:22.27]They go for like $75 each.
[51:24.99]It was Roger Rabbit and Carnage.
[51:28.20]So, I mean, like $212 total.
[51:33.48]So-called superhero.
[51:35.84]You think you save people, but you just make it worse.
[51:39.42]This is your fault.
[51:41.18]My fault?
[51:42.02]He was under your protection.
[51:44.00]You really need two of those?
[51:47.64]Hey, I can do that too.
[51:48.78]Stop!
[51:49.96]We need to brief Mr. Osborn now.
[51:54.02]I'll go with her.
[51:55.38]Thank you.
[51:56.64]I'll remember this.
[51:57.26]Dude, I would just like go right in her face and be just right in her face and say, you don't have a pop figurine made of your character.
[52:14.15]Yuri, tell me you've got a lead on Martin Lee's location.
[52:17.52]That is something that Peter would say.
[52:18.62]That's what I'm saying.
[52:42.95]Dr. Michaels?
[52:44.23]How are you calling?
[52:44.87]This is working.
[52:45.63]Far out on one of Sable's radios.
[52:47.35]Listen.
[52:48.33]Transit hubs are the most likely release points for Devil's Breath.
[52:51.31]Airports, bus terminals, train stations.
[52:54.06]It'll spread like wildfire from there.
[52:56.06]Why the hell is Oscorp developing a bioweapon in the city?
[52:59.40]I can't laugh.
[53:00.10]My fucking head can't.
[53:02.00]Devil's Breath is personal for Norman.
[53:03.94]That is such a Spider-Man insult.
[53:06.18]The project breaks every state and federal regulation on the books.
[53:10.61]If the city finds out, we can just re-election goodbye.
[53:13.53]Never mind re-election.
[53:15.53]Backpack.
[53:18.25]Why are you telling me all this?
[53:19.39]Backpack and a keychain.
[53:20.25]Aren't you just as culpable as Norman?
[53:22.53]Yes.
[53:23.85]Completely.
[53:24.31]Alright, where is it?
[53:25.31]But Lee's actions have been a wake-up call.
[53:27.81]We've ignored the project's risk for too long.
[53:30.41]I trust you, Spider-Man.
[53:31.95]You're the only one trying to do the right thing.
[53:33.81]Please, protect the city from our mistakes.
[53:36.55]Hmm.
[53:40.72]What does the yellow flower signify?
[53:51.76]Yellow rose... Red roses are romantic.
[53:56.81]White roses are congratulations.
[54:00.53]Pink roses are grats on the baby.
[54:02.43]I don't know.
[54:04.19]How does it work?
[54:07.77]Something like that, right?
[54:10.97]Doc left word.
[54:11.53]Right here.
[54:12.63]Friendship, okay.
[54:13.93]Oh, thank you.
[54:14.47]My mentor was telling me about how we together did a massive, massive progression in scientific discovery.
[54:22.04]Thanking me for all my help.
[54:40.77]And we're going to change the universe with our pyrotechnics or whatever, right?
[54:45.19]I'd fucking hang up on him and look through a telescope into people's windows.
[54:49.87]Okay.
[55:01.20]That's not it.
[55:01.63]There it is.
[55:07.20]Right there, right there.
[55:20.13]Can I call him back?
[55:21.67]I wish there was a cell phone, like in GTA.
[55:24.49]So I could just call him back and they would just pick up the conversation where it left.
[55:27.39]There it is.
[55:27.71]Okay, we're fine.
[55:28.39]Okay.
[55:50.95]Ah shit, that was to do it later.
[55:57.21]I'll call him back.
[55:58.89]While I'm here, I should examine the transmitter MJ found.
[56:10.31]This is the reason why he turns into Octavius.
[56:15.35]That little shit.
[56:18.35]I'll show him.
[56:20.05]I'll show everyone.
[56:23.49]I don't want to do this.
[56:27.00]I don't want to do this thing.
[56:27.92]No, let's go back and listen to the voicemail.
[56:31.72]I can't get out of here.
[56:32.38]How do I get out?
[56:35.02]Oh, God.
[56:35.54]Abandoned.
[56:36.56]Ah, I can't.
[56:46.71]I just want to hear the mission.
[56:48.15]Let's go back and call them again.
[56:49.27]I don't want to do that right now.
[56:56.60]Most people will never know anything beyond what they see with their own two eyes.
[57:03.04]Okay, let's listen to that voicemail.
[57:12.69]Let's get that voicemail back on.
[57:14.05]What do you say?
[57:14.53]You should finish listening to Doc's voicemail.
[57:17.43]Parker, I wanted to thank you.
[57:20.65]Your work on the neural interface has been invaluable.
[57:24.11]I wish you could see what that means right now.
[57:26.88]But it's beginning to dawn on me just how powerful and insidious the forces arrayed against true visionaries are.
[57:32.52]Nah, I'm gonna listen.
[57:35.10]I'm gonna listen to it.
[57:37.00]Success will come, whatever it takes.
[57:40.70]Powerful and insidious forces.
[57:42.36]I don't like the sound of that.
[57:44.26]Need to check on Doc when I get a chance.
[57:47.04]Is he here?
[57:47.44]What's he doing in the car?
[57:48.62]Is he in this car?
[57:52.92]Damn.
[57:53.72]Devil's breath is gone.
[57:55.64]I should call MJ and warn her.
[57:58.56]This is Mary Jane Watson.
[57:59.71]Please leave a detailed message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
[58:02.29]Beep.
[58:04.45]Hey, Mary Jane.
[58:05.77]Don't go start a mission or anything like I did to Doc five times.
[58:14.77]This is an important message for you.
[58:21.92]Yeah.
[58:23.32]Stander said the demons are looking for something at GCT.
[58:27.12]But what could they possibly need here?
[58:29.42]Should probably call Peter and let him know what I'm doing.
[58:32.71]Actually, scratch that.
[58:34.57]He'd probably just tell me to go home and chain myself to my laptop.
[58:38.27]I'll just check things out quick and let him know what I find.
[58:43.76]Ozcorp Industries.
[58:44.42]Hmm.
[58:44.50]Okay.
[59:10.36]Examine Oscorp displays.
[59:11.94]So I just have to read them and watch them.
[59:13.52]I was looking at the ceiling.
[59:16.97]Somebody said look at the ceiling.
[59:18.13]I thought there was like a big display of Norman Osborn's face or something.
[59:21.69]There's actually missiles on the display.
[59:23.51]That's not encouraging at all.
[59:46.87]What about this one?
[59:47.51]Cool.
[60:11.51]At what point does security come up and go, ma'am, ma'am, excuse me.
[60:38.47]What?
[60:38.63]Oh, I did it.
[60:39.25]Oh!
[61:01.91]This will be easier for everyone if you remain calm and do as I say.
[61:06.77]Police!
[61:13.66]Over here!
[61:18.88]No!
[61:19.02]Where's the rest of them?
[61:20.84]Wait, there's only one police?
[61:27.89]This is one guy?
[61:32.48]There's just one police.
[61:36.41]There we go.
[61:37.73]Oh.
[61:40.95]There's two.
[61:59.04]Only two police.
[62:00.16]I would like to speak to Mayor Osborne.
[62:02.36]Can the goblin come too?
[62:04.00]He thinks he looked tough doing that, but you just have to buy a new iPhone now.
[62:09.87]That's all that happened there.
[62:11.17]And you may have got cuts all over your hand.
[62:41.31]Okay, so I have to escape the situation here.
[62:43.91]It's on speakerphone.
[63:06.87]I don't know.
[63:07.21]Maybe.
[63:07.59]Anything to look out for.
[63:09.87]Hey, I'm here.
[63:10.51]Spider-Man's here.
[63:11.65]I'm in the vent system.
[63:15.23]One of these guys could get a fucking promotion real quick.
[63:39.37]What, I have to find an entrance for him?
[63:42.35]Yeah.
[63:44.85]On my way.
[63:52.94]I kind of just want to watch this.
[63:54.44]I hope I don't have to be Spider-Man.
[63:56.02]See that tablet I'm holding?
[64:00.02]There he is!
[64:00.68]There's Spider-Man!
[64:02.66]Think you can snag it?
[64:03.94]Yes.
[64:04.86]If you can distract them.
[64:06.76]And not get shot.
[64:18.41]Uh-oh, he's here.
[64:18.99]Alright, it's 4.05 right now.
[64:22.16]Tell me if that clock moves.
[64:24.50]Stand up, Mary.
[64:26.76]Mary.
[64:32.24]There's people in the way.
[64:38.30]They're not going to take me without a fight.
[64:39.94]What?
[64:40.32]No.
[64:40.56]What are you doing?
[64:42.48]What the fuck are you doing?
[64:45.61]Wait.
[64:46.01]What are you doing?
[64:47.11]Let's all just relax.
[64:49.61]Did you not see Spider-Man up there?
[64:51.83]I have a direct line to Mayor Osborne.
[64:54.11]I can help make sure he arrives on time.
[64:57.63]I'm going for it.
[64:59.57]Let him go.
[65:00.76]Excuse me.
[65:07.34]Hold on.
[65:07.82]Wait.
[65:09.56]Hold on.
[65:16.57]Come on.
[65:16.89]Hold on.
[65:18.01]I just want to turn on the Oscorp thing again.
[65:25.17]I can't.
[65:25.61]I can't do it.
[65:29.05]This is where you go like this, right?
[65:30.50]You go, hold on.
[65:32.02]You dart right.
[65:32.78]Dart left.
[65:33.18]Dart right.
[65:33.58]And then sprint left.
[65:39.36]I can't do it.
[65:40.26]The game keeps turning me around.
[65:41.36]It's forcing me to go through here.
[65:50.22]And then you get shot.
[65:51.19]No, not if you're faster than bullets.
[65:53.15]See, look at how fast that is.
[65:53.85]You know what I mean?
[65:56.61]We're talking about, like, you see me here, and then... They would all hit behind me and shit.
[66:01.85]Can't let him see me.
[66:12.67]Every time.
[66:15.01]Every time.
[66:18.12]This has not been one time I haven't knocked over trash.
[66:22.26]Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[66:23.92]Drones, get to cover.
[66:26.79]You still got that tablet?
[66:27.91]Yeah.
[66:29.05]Better work fast.
[66:30.11]Okay, I got this.
[66:32.37]Come on, come on.
[66:33.87]It's almost there.
[66:38.25]That's an upside down face.
[66:40.45]Good job.
[66:41.09]That's just his face.
[66:41.97]What about the devil's breath?
[66:43.33]I'll come back for it.
[66:44.11]No.
[66:45.07]We're partners, remember?
[66:47.17]Can we argue later?
[66:48.95]If we don't help those people, they could die.
[66:51.27]So could you.
[66:52.13]I can't let that happen.
[66:53.41]No.
[66:54.36]No, I got myself into this.
[66:55.48]I'm getting myself out.
[66:56.22]What do you mean you got yourself into this?
[67:00.28]Listen to Spider-Man.
[67:01.82]I don't like this.
[67:02.72]There's too many of them.
[67:03.68]Then let's start taking them out.
[67:11.35]Where is Spider-Man?
[67:11.97]Where is Spider-Man?
[67:13.69]I don't understand.
[67:15.49]Where is Spider-Man?
[67:16.19]Why did you not go over there?
[67:20.80]I suffocated that guy.
[67:22.04]Good.
[67:22.16]I guess.
[67:46.36]Alright, so I took the guy's gun and his brain was connected to his gun.
[67:50.48]That turned off his brain when I pulled the gun from his hand.
[67:53.14]Do I have to go down here?
[68:00.89]That's very loud.
[68:01.37]Nobody heard that.
[68:16.21]Come on, man.
[68:19.70]There we go.
[68:23.12]I think I'm knocking them out with the guns.
[68:25.94]I'm sucking the guns up so fast that it's like smashing them in the head.
[68:31.55]Who?
[68:40.59]Oh.
[68:44.97]I'm trying to get this guy.
[68:48.27]Okay.
[68:55.73]MJ, did you know Lee would be here?
[68:58.15]Not exactly.
[68:59.33]What do you mean?
[69:00.35]I thought something might happen, but not like this.
[69:03.59]Why didn't you tell me?
[69:04.57]I thought we were partners.
[69:06.51]Partners trust each other, Peter.
[69:08.89]I trust you.
[69:09.73]Yeah, when I'm sitting at home behind a laptop.
[69:18.53]Alright, take up spider-man It worked Mass confusion
[69:46.72]Now he's gonna turn him on.
[69:47.60]Turn it on!
[69:48.42]No, don't break!
[69:49.04]Turn it on!
[69:49.94]Two minutes.
[69:50.60]Can't be turned on.
[70:17.47]What are we doing?
[70:18.57]Rotate the device.
[70:19.97]Up.
[70:20.17]Keep talking and nobody explodes.
[70:23.17]Blue is the battery.
[70:25.24]Okay, blue, go.
[70:25.80]We really are playing keep talking and don't explode.
[70:27.62]Okay, the manual says... There's a symbol.
[70:29.68]Do you see a symbol there?
[70:47.47]This should be a symbol.
[70:48.11]It looks like a triangle with a dog in the middle.
[70:51.13]I don't know.
[70:51.63]I don't know.
[70:52.09]Disconnect the battery wires.
[70:54.85]Okay, the battery wires are these two.
[70:56.71]This goes... Hold on a second.
[71:00.61]It goes underneath.
[71:02.89]That's that one, and this is this here.
[71:05.36]This is a battery.
[71:07.06]How do I cut it?
[71:07.62]Okay.
[71:12.28]That's a battery.
[71:12.84]Okay.
[71:17.22]Okay, this one goes around this way.
[71:20.48]Up and in.
[71:21.62]It's this one here.
[71:22.40]I did it!
[71:24.18]Okay, I could have just ripped out every wire, couldn't I?
[71:27.65]I could have just pulled all four out at the same time.
[71:46.85]Will do.
[71:54.40]Oh, shit.
[71:59.52]Oh, God.
[71:59.90]He's too far.
[72:01.44]Hold on.
[72:01.86]Wait, wait, wait.
[72:02.60]He needs to move an inch to his right.
[72:06.89]An inch.
[72:08.07]An inch.
[72:08.71]Hold on.
[72:09.01]Gotta be careful or the hostages will get hurt.
[72:17.49]Oh, wait!
[72:17.75]No!
[72:17.81]If I did, everything's fine, guys.
[72:22.02]I'm just gonna lose points.
[72:25.64]Not very much.
[72:26.70]I'm just gonna lose a bonus point.
[72:47.97]Hold on, hold on a minute.
[72:49.33]Let's do the fucking carousel.
[72:55.28]Bad ending.
[72:56.02]Alright, let's go.
[73:02.18]Do it up.
[73:10.61]You, come here.
[73:11.37]Oh, I didn't get that upgrade yet.
[73:16.33]Never mind.
[73:20.05]The web move is amazing.
[73:21.35]It really is.
[73:33.83]Don't think so.
[73:48.66]I just broke that guy's back.
[73:51.84]Alright, we're good.
[73:53.74]That's pretty cool, Spider-Man.
[73:58.44]Oh, there's people in here.
[74:00.04]There's still people that are... I don't know what... I'm trying to figure out what the hell that was.
[74:06.33]Oh, it's a guy with a grenade.
[74:08.89]I want to throw that back.
[74:12.95]Anyway, I could talk trivia all day, but I gotta stop your wingnut of a boss from destroying the city.
[74:18.59]Time to wrap this up.
[74:19.33]There's a guy with a gun.
[74:25.10]Up here.
[74:28.50]Is this two of them?
[74:30.68]No, you're over there.
[74:31.94]Hi.
[74:32.16]Okay, well, he's gone.
[74:37.70]Uh... Uh... Doi!
[74:52.22]Rock away.
[74:53.88]Nope.
[74:54.60]I thought he was right there.
[74:57.78]There you are.
[75:02.04]Focus bar full.
[75:02.76]Good.
[75:04.60]Go board the train.
[75:05.86]Okay.
[75:08.84]Do I have to kill all these guys first?
[75:13.46]Or do I just go?
[75:17.91]I guess we can just go.
[75:21.33]Ooh.
[75:21.97]Boss fight on the train.
[75:23.25]We've seen this one before.
[75:25.85]Go.
[75:26.35]Just go.
[75:28.53]Are we gonna get a side-scrolling train fight?
[75:32.04]Nice.
[75:32.56]Okay.
[75:52.91]I was going to say, dude, this guy kind of sucks.
[76:01.07]Besides your grab-people-convert powers... Oh, he's taking extra power.
[76:07.78]I get it.
[76:13.20]Sure.
[76:13.38]Fine.
[76:13.50]Part 2.
[76:26.62]Oh, I've dodged the scythe.
[76:28.18]Okay.
[76:42.37]It's just the shocker fight again.
[76:48.03]Oops.
[76:49.81]Jump to the ceiling.
[76:51.37]They're giving me new things to do.
[77:07.54]Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[77:08.94]Alright, so is it going to tell me when to do it, or do I just dive out of the way?
[77:13.53]I guess it's...
[77:16.31]When he goes down, I think, is when you go up.
[77:26.06]Gotta move fast before he recovers.
[77:43.59]Did somebody spray him?
[77:44.29]I think he just got sprayed in the face.
[77:50.61]Alright, when he puts both hands in the air, he'll go off.
[77:53.57]Yeah, there we go.
[77:54.75]I get it.
[78:00.29]Don't think so.
[78:03.65]I don't want to hurt you!
[78:06.55]Nothing can hurt me!
[78:07.89]Not anymore!
[78:16.51]I gotta do Two Fingers in the eyes, man.
[78:18.81]Sometimes you gotta curl with somebody.
[78:31.49]Oh god.
[78:37.53]Got it.
[78:42.52]Is there some reason why Kingpin is the hardest boss in the game and he's the tutorial?
[78:46.42]Is this the Spider-Man 2 adventure?
[79:11.41]Next stop, prison.
[79:18.77]That really isn't a Spider-Man 2 meme.
[79:22.73]Huh.
[79:25.13]That's cool.
[79:25.65]What do you think the taxes are in New York for this?
[79:34.90]You know what I'm saying?
[79:36.98]In the superhero universe, who pays for all this?
[79:41.01]It has to be, like, 80 to 85% taxable income.
[79:47.13]For every single citizen.
[79:48.45]Get that cargo back to the lab.
[79:51.17]There's no way.
[79:52.17]Let's move!
[79:53.79]Spider-Man, Batman, Superman, Green Goblin.
[79:57.31]The city gets destroyed, like, four times a week.
[80:01.10]By superhero fights.
[80:02.18]Please leave a detailed message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

[80:53.88]Uh-oh.
[80:54.92]Eh, not okay.
[80:58.76]Ah, shit, this is like, this is too real.
[81:11.44]Oh, you think?
[81:18.72]I'm calling tomorrow, baby.
[81:19.78]Oh, God.
[81:22.96]Great.
[81:25.71]That's pretty good.
[81:26.81]That's like some realistic, real texting there.
[81:33.90]I swear I've had that conversation before.
[81:35.20]Yeah.
[81:35.30]That was so real I had to look at my phone.
[81:56.72]You know, I just look at my phone for a second and be like, hold on, what's going on here?
[81:59.14]All this time with Lee, I've been ignoring this city.
[82:02.07]Time to get back to being a friendly neighborhood Spidey.
[82:04.93]Alright, let's do some upgrades.
[82:11.89]New suit.
[82:13.96]Ooh, is this the... Oh, that's a little too... I don't know, that's a little too fan fiction for me.
[82:29.76]Does that make any sense?
[82:42.12]It's cool.
[82:44.44]I don't really like the helmet that much, though.
[82:47.49]This one definitely has AC.
[82:48.55]You can see the AC unit on the back.
[82:51.49]I think this might be the only one with a real air conditioning unit.
[82:55.37]Is it?
[83:00.44]I mean, this is like cooled plates.
[83:01.95]Liquid gel plates, but... Yeah.
[83:12.65]Yeah, I mean, that's the one.
[83:14.41]I think that's the one.
[83:18.81]Dr. Scholl's Spider-Man suit.
[83:27.06]Wrestling suit.
[83:27.76]I think it's time to go back to one of the ones I liked before.
[83:35.55]This looks like the muscle suit you buy at the party store.
[83:40.07]Out of all of them, I think I like... I think I like pajamas.
[83:47.82]I like the Scarlet Spider suit.
[83:50.78]Either that or the wrestler suit.
[83:55.10]I like this one the best.
[84:00.92]I'm going to put it on.
[84:02.54]Suit power, though, I... This one's just... This one's kind of overpowered.
[84:11.29]To a point where when I was fighting against Mr. Negative, you notice how I cleared the entire room and then the game had to wait three or four seconds before I could do anything about it?
[84:20.05]I think it might be too much.
[84:25.50]King of the Ring is good.
[84:26.50]I mean, of course.
[84:27.60]Why would I not put it back on?
[84:30.97]New mods.
[84:33.69]Chance to generate gadget refills when taking damage.
[84:39.00]That's kind of cool.
[84:41.34]Plasma discharging mesh electrifies suit surface.
[84:44.42]Stunning enemies who touch it.
[84:46.50]So this is Thorns.
[84:48.18]But it's on a cooldown.
[84:50.86]Okay.
[84:52.78]I feel like I've been so boring with these mods.
[84:56.60]Let's change the...
[85:00.67]Okay, that's not a... I was making sure that wasn't like a realtor thing.
[85:07.95]No, I can call them later.
[85:10.49]Okay, so kinetic power cells.
[85:15.75]I need more tokens.
[85:21.07]Slow time.
[85:25.19]This is cool, but I don't know if it's worth replacing these.
[85:34.66]Maybe I will.
[85:37.40]Hmm.
[85:37.94]No.
[85:38.06]Can I do this one?
[85:41.85]Impact web cascade.
[85:43.13]Enemies knocked back by the impact web will spread their webbing to enemies they collide with.
[85:47.33]I want it right now.
[85:50.01]You can make a bowling scenario here.
[85:52.80]Base token and challenge tokens.
[85:54.02]We need to go clear base and get a challenge token.
[85:58.20]This is new.
[86:00.60]Lifts enemies into the air and holds them there for a short duration.
[86:04.39]Little vortex.
[86:08.89]That's cool.
[86:09.45]I don't know if it's as cool as... No, it's cool.
[86:17.03]I have three skill points now.
[86:19.08]Alright.
[86:20.82]Bianc, heavy arms.
[86:23.44]Now I'll actually do it.
[86:27.38]You can throw the weapon.
[86:28.36]You pull it out, and you can throw the weapon back at people.
[86:32.56]And I don't think I can't do anything else.
[86:35.33]Now I will actually do this.
[86:41.77]Alright.
[86:43.51]New side missions unlocked.
[86:44.71]I need a base token, right?
[86:46.87]Let's get the map open.
[86:47.77]I need a base token.
[86:48.92]What's this?
[86:51.08]Challenge token.
[86:51.76]I need these two.
[86:52.64]So let's go do this.
[86:54.58]Drone challenge.
[86:56.46]Bomb challenge.
[86:59.26]This one's probably closer.
[87:01.62]Let's go do this one.
[87:10.21]I want that last level up.
[87:11.85]Alright.
[87:12.29]Bomb token.
[87:17.63]It's this guy again, right?
[87:21.39]The guy with the mask?
[87:41.09]Oh, where's the guy with the mask?
[87:52.56]This one's closer.
[88:00.17]What?
[88:01.63]Oh, she had to break the damn thing.
[88:09.21]Why would you put it inside of a box like that?
[88:22.90]This one's just inside of a crate.
[88:31.07]And it's right in the street.
[88:39.72]Don't worry.
[88:40.27]Don't worry.
[88:40.61]Don't throw it into the... Wow.
[88:42.05]Okay.
[88:44.45]I only got... I got one.
[88:46.71]I got one.
[88:48.57]The box fucked me up there.
[88:49.64]Try this one more time.
[88:54.24]Blame the box.
[88:54.90]It wasn't my fault.
[89:07.09]Let's go... I'm going to wrap around.
[89:08.71]I feel like this one's furthest away.
[89:18.64]Let's do this one first.
[89:22.14]And then the other ones will be closer.
[89:23.60]And that's probably completely incorrect.
[89:26.34]Got the blast contained.
[89:39.12]This one here.
[89:39.76]Dammit, come on.
[89:43.34]Gotta find the last bomb.
[89:57.11]Now it turns out that was probably not the best idea.
[90:01.05]Yep.
[90:01.43]What are you doing?
[90:02.57]Ah!
[90:03.03]Stop!
[90:03.69]Why?
[90:04.37]Oh my fucking god.
[90:05.95]What is happening?
[90:08.41]What the fuck was that?
[90:09.65]No, I did it completely.
[90:13.04]I'm not gonna make the challenge.
[90:18.20]I went like the complete wrong way.
[90:27.28]That just doubled the length of the journey.
[90:29.20]Yeah.
[90:30.20]Because I went, I wrapped all the way around.
[90:31.52]We're gonna go left first.
[90:33.76]Gotta hurry and defuse those bombs.
[90:46.20]Okay, took care of that one.
[90:51.92]There's this one.
[91:04.63]Okay, one more.
[91:17.34]I'm not gonna lie, I'm feeling pretty good about myself right now.
[91:27.15]There it is.
[91:31.15]That's enough challenge tokens.
[91:32.43]You know, just this one right here.
[91:35.59]I think things are sort of under control.
[91:37.40]I want to do it.
[91:38.48]Maybe I should put in some Peter Parker time at the lab.
[91:40.44]Because I need, there are other upgrades that need these challenge tokens.
[91:43.34]Let's just get some of them out of the way.
[91:50.93]The question is, is it on the roof?
[91:55.03]Or not?
[91:57.55]Sometimes the momentum is too much.
[92:08.86]Drone challenge.
[92:10.98]Oh no, don't tell me I gotta take this down.
[92:24.87]okay so follow the drone as it drops spy cams along its route for bonus points traverse through their blue connection field you have to follow the drone gotta follow that drone now it goes through its blue connection field okay
[92:58.08]I got it.
[92:58.46]Alright, so it's pretty forgiving going through them.
[93:19.82]Too late.
[93:21.04]I jumped.
[93:23.05]Too late.
[93:24.67]I gotta get lower to the ground here.
[93:35.31]just don't even do any of the uh quick moves just glide through there's no reason to use x here now I can catch the drone so close to perfection oh well I'll take it I feel like that could be hard time bonus too how do you get a time bonus
[93:59.66]Isn't the whole thing just a finite amount of time because you have to follow it?
[94:05.22]Okay.
[94:06.30]Oh, we got research token over here.
[94:08.81]Let me see.
[94:10.95]I wanted to do that for a specific reason, so hold on.
[94:14.15]I need a base token.
[94:14.73]Ugh.
[94:29.40]Those are the worst.
[94:32.70]Backpack token to get this completely full with his increased time enemy stay webbed.
[94:36.64]There's probably a backpack sitting around here somewhere, right?
[94:38.82]Keep your eyes peeled.
[94:46.27]You know what I like about you, kid?
[94:48.15]You're always getting better.
[94:50.13]Gee, thanks, creepy stalker guy.
[94:54.79]The Taskmaster.
[94:55.51]He said it.
[94:56.23]He said Taskmaster.
[94:56.92]Alright.
[94:57.20]He's just a big fan.
[95:30.34]Hell's Kitchen.
[95:37.33]Backpack?
[95:39.67]Backpack.
[95:42.35]Don't mind if I do.
[95:51.06]Backpack and a landmark.
[95:54.81]And right here.
[95:55.45]And there's crime right here.
[95:57.37]I'll get the crime token after we look at this.
[96:00.21]Spider-Man the killer.
[96:01.21]Okay.
[96:06.08]Crime right here.
[96:06.68]Let's get it.
[96:27.76]Oh, big guy.
[96:57.11]Gun?
[96:57.83]I'll take it.
[97:10.22]Prime token.
[97:11.52]Thank you!
[97:16.41]And there was a landmark right here too, wasn't there?
[97:19.63]Where is it?
[97:21.55]Landmark, landmark, landmark.
[97:24.25]I gotta get fire.
[97:28.46]Where's that landmark?
[97:31.19]There it is.
[97:31.61]Okay.
[97:38.57]There's actually a few things over here.
[97:44.64]There's a prime, and it's this corner of this building.
[97:48.46]Whatever is up here.
[98:06.83]My pictures are so bad.
[98:08.41]Let me get a good one.
[98:10.69]There we go.
[98:17.42]Redemption.
[98:18.00]I got it.
[98:18.30]Now let's unlock the last part of the web shooter.
[98:26.70]I think it's fully upgraded.
[98:31.74]For this one, we need a base token, which I don't really want to do right now.
[98:34.98]A couple crime tokens.
[98:38.96]Crime.
[98:39.74]Backpack.
[98:42.22]Crime.
[98:44.24]Backpack.
[98:47.36]Crime.
[98:48.82]Base.
[98:49.40]Okay, I need a lot of crime tokens.
[98:50.78]But we'll do that later.
[98:55.23]Let's go talk to Otto.
[98:57.14]Oh, it's right here.
[99:00.62]It's just right here.
[99:02.34]Right?
[99:02.60]So they... Alright, let's look.
[99:03.72]Okay.
[99:03.94]I'm just trying to... Okay, just fight them.
[99:11.59]I'm like, oh, pull me a gun.
[99:13.13]That's how good I do it.
[99:37.03]Give me that gun.
[99:38.75]Give me that gun.
[99:42.25]Should have probably taken that gun.
[99:45.43]Give me it.
[99:52.94]Now you come here.
[100:04.69]Like, they go pick the guns back up.
[100:08.77]Of course they do.
[100:19.96]Don't shoot it.
[100:20.72]Don't shoot it!
[100:24.68]Okay, last guy.
[100:30.36]He's over here.
[100:33.16]What is he doing?
[100:36.10]What's going on?
[100:36.58]Oh.
[100:36.64]Okay, I'll take care of it.
[100:39.75]Two crime pilgrims.
[100:40.83]Another one?
[100:42.51]Another one, let's get it.
[100:43.37]I'll be able to do at least two or three upgrades from this.
[101:19.93]Whoops-a-daisy.
[101:22.85]What was the challenges for this one?
[101:26.79]I didn't even see it.
[101:35.60]Really?
[101:35.90]Give me that.
[101:37.19]Give me that stuff.
[101:39.85]Don't shoot that at me.
[101:55.60]Do you really want that?
[102:09.03]The demons are getting full.
[102:10.53]Crime token.
[102:13.33]So all of Hell's Kitchen has been cleared of crimes.
[102:15.21]Just backing you up, sport.
[102:16.39]There's a challenge token over there, too.
[102:18.71]No, let's go.
[102:19.13]Let's go, go, go, go, go.
[102:19.81]Hold on.
[102:20.26]Let me upgrade the things that I wanted to upgrade.
[102:24.11]This is the thing I wanted the most.
[102:25.47]And it's a base token.
[102:26.41]I keep forgetting that it's a base token.
[102:31.02]I don't... I can't do anything here.
[102:32.64]I guess I could.
[102:33.18]Stealth takedown's more focused, sure.
[102:35.64]Why not?
[102:36.00]And then upgraded web strike takedown.
[102:39.94]So all enemies are knocked back.
[102:42.37]Alright.
[102:44.67]Back to the gadget.
[102:46.47]I can do this.
[102:47.99]Drones can fire more shots.
[102:52.74]Chris's maximum shots for the web bomb.
[102:57.49]Okay.
[102:58.81]Actually, maybe I should make one of these.
[103:00.03]No, I can't.
[103:01.79]Trip mines.
[103:03.39]Oh, let's do the drones.
[103:04.23]I don't think I can do this too.
[103:09.12]Nope.
[103:10.78]Alright, I'm ready.
[103:12.52]I'm not ready.
[103:19.09]That's so funny.
[103:19.63]That guy could have just... What if he wasn't turning?
[103:22.13]What if he was just getting sick?
[103:24.53]You know?
[103:25.95]What if he just got out of some, like, street meat vendor and was getting sick?
[103:30.35]Alright.
[103:33.52]What do we need the picture of, please?
[103:38.00]Here's another call of a type I've been getting a lot lately.
[103:41.46]Speak!
[103:42.44]Mr. Jameson, I want to apologize.
[103:44.30]I used to think you were an alarmist.
[103:46.14]But look what's happened to the city.
[103:47.62]I'm afraid to walk the streets.
[103:49.76]As well you should.
[103:51.10]And I accept your apology.
[103:52.78]It's understandable you were bamboozled by the mainstream voices telling you everything was taken deep.
[103:58.58]Nothing to worry about.
[103:59.76]Go out and consume.
[104:01.46]Don't ask questions.
[104:03.34]I was a lone voice.
[104:07.30]A base.
[104:07.84]Alright, do I do it or do I not do it?
[104:11.42]It's right here.
[104:11.86]It's on the way.
[104:12.26]Should I do it?
[104:13.13]Should I just get it out of the way?
[104:14.53]Should I just do it and get it out of the way?
[104:15.95]Should I just do it?
[104:19.73]No, don't do it.
[104:20.69]Do it.
[104:21.43]Do it.
[104:21.79]I'm going to do it.
[104:29.62]Hi.
[104:30.36]We can fight or hear me out.
[104:32.08]We can barbecue.
[104:41.39]Where's... Other guy?
[104:54.98]Other guy?
[105:00.04]Other guy.
[105:00.64]Nice.
[105:00.92]I'm invisible again.
[105:13.53]Is he inside of here?
[105:22.14]I'm confused.
[105:25.64]He cannot hide forever.
[105:29.26]Are you talking about yourself or are you talking about me?
[105:32.10]Because... Oh, he is inside of there.
[105:40.59]He didn't come out of the house.
[105:52.36]Can I, like, bait him to come over here?
[105:59.95]Did I... I kicked him.
[106:04.83]What if I rock out next to him?
[106:11.46]I did it.
[106:26.07]He wants me to go in.
[106:37.28]Hold on, so have I lost my mind completely, or it was... Oh, okay.
[106:49.52]This is the first time this has happened, though.
[106:53.35]They'd have to actually go inside.
[106:57.94]All these base tokens so far have just been out in the open.
[106:59.90]You just clear waves of people.
[107:04.18]Stealth.
[107:04.92]Take down.
[107:05.26]Web.
[107:05.52]Throw 10 enemies.
[107:05.96]Let's try to get it all.
[107:06.92]Definitely take out the guys with the rocket launchers.
[107:09.86]I mean, like, seriously.
[107:29.15]Okay, where is anybody else over here?
[107:31.55]That guy see that?
[107:32.45]It's far too quiet.
[107:34.85]Summon the others!
[107:57.35]Right when I pull up, a guy breaks through the door.
[108:07.06]I heard something!
[108:07.72]Quick!
[108:10.28]Okay.
[108:12.84]Well, that... You know what I'm gonna do here.
[108:16.62]Here we go!
[108:38.60]Pull up the menu, let's do some electricity.
[108:46.88]And a one, and a two, and a three.
[108:52.20]And yep.
[108:55.04]What else we got?
[109:01.82]I need, let's go, let's... Let's get the drones.
[109:10.13]At the next wave.
[109:10.67]So I gotta web throw people, don't I?
[109:16.76]I'm just forgetting about that.
[109:21.20]I gotta get you.
[109:22.86]Let's web throw these dudes.
[109:37.32]No, they're getting stuck to walls
[110:10.13]No, no, no, no, no.
[110:12.17]I really need to get this because I want more of a bonus.
[110:15.57]I want a bonus.
[110:26.03]No, don't do it.
[110:26.77]There's only two.
[110:29.83]He's going to be webbed.
[110:31.29]I don't want him to get webbed to the wall.
[110:38.62]That didn't do it.
[110:42.98]Three out of ten.
[110:44.26]I could do that a lot more times.
[110:45.36]That's all for down here, right?
[110:54.62]Oh, I'm throwing.
[111:15.22]Seven.
[111:15.54]Three more times.
[111:27.09]One more.
[111:27.73]How about you, right here?
[111:29.41]Yes, you are.
[111:30.01]No, you're not.
[111:30.61]Now you are.
[111:31.21]Did I just kill them both?
[111:35.89]Thank God.
[111:36.37]Okay, now let's just get everybody.
[111:43.33]Here we go.
[111:50.21]The math is hurting your... What do you mean, the math?
[111:59.98]Where are you going?
[112:02.66]Can I pull weapons?
[112:12.82]That does... Okay, that counts as a gun.
[112:17.14]Interesting.
[112:23.47]I got it.
[112:23.77]How many do I get?
[112:24.33]Just one?
[112:28.11]Math.
[112:29.11]He's doing math problems.
[112:31.19]Three base tokens.
[112:32.09]Good.
[112:32.31]At the end of the game, the math problems get really hard.
[112:36.33]Well, we're going to have to do it together because I don't want to do math problems.
[112:58.13]Can I turn on an extension for you guys to take the controller from me?
[113:03.08]Alright.
[113:04.56]Let me go upgrade that gadget.
[113:08.86]Here's the final upgrade here.
[113:12.44]Spreads to other people they collide with.
[113:13.90]Which is a big deal.
[113:16.34]Could also probably do... I need backpack tokens for that.
[113:18.92]What's one of the needed base tokens?
[113:21.80]One of these needed base tokens.
[113:24.44]This one.
[113:25.70]Alright.
[113:25.94]Suspension Matrix.
[113:33.29]That's all I can do.
[113:35.83]Yep.
[113:37.27]Yep.
[113:38.61]Yep.
[113:39.15]Yep.
[113:39.47]Okay.
[113:41.20]Time to continue the story.
[113:44.94]What do you say?
[113:54.71]Shoot away.
[113:55.55]Love that shot.
[113:57.33]I gotta run.
[113:59.84]I'm sorry.
[114:00.46]I could be taking so much more time lining those up and seeing what they were and looking up what they are.
[114:16.57]It is right here.
[114:24.01]Vulture jammer.
[114:24.85]The jammer I whipped up to jam Vulture's wings.
[114:28.05]Too bad he improved them after that.
[114:31.75]Very cool.
[114:35.19]23 out of 55 backpacks.
[114:39.76]Okay.
[114:40.92]Even the mole people living in the sewers know about the high-speed chase between police, Spider-Man, and the team.
[114:47.24]Once again, Spider-Man makes the bad situation infinitely worse.
[114:52.16]And we have a highly intelligent caller who agrees with me.
[114:56.04]You're on with J. Jonah Jameson.
[114:58.52]The math maniac
[115:35.62]Hello?
[115:36.50]Parker!
[115:37.50]Is it time to celebrate?
[115:39.19]Just in time to celebrate.
[115:43.07]Celebrate?
[115:47.09]Wait.
[115:48.55]Where are the arms?
[115:52.47]Oh, wow.
[115:54.57]So cool.
[115:56.65]Oh, God.
[115:57.83]Intracranial neural network.
[116:01.08]Neurotransmission speeds under one nanosecond.
[116:04.38]Faster than signals travel inside the brain.
[116:07.08]Never mind to an external prosthesis.
[116:10.18]We did it, Peter.
[116:13.34]Why did you have to make him so scary?
[116:15.52]You know what I mean?
[116:16.69]Amazing.
[116:18.75]They were arms.
[116:19.43]And your work on the neural web was the key.
[116:23.43]But we haven't even tested it yet.
[116:24.99]There's so much we don't know.
[116:26.31]It works beautifully.
[116:27.31]Come on, take a look.
[116:30.18]You had to make them giant, scary snakes?
[116:40.07]Diagnostics.
[116:41.01]Oh, man.
[116:41.37]Am I going to screw this up?
[116:43.17]Why is that Alfred Hitchcock?
[116:44.37]Damn it.
[116:57.84]Alright, so actual vultures eight I need two I Need minus six here So let's see we got -2.
[117:07.62]Oh my god.
[117:08.56]Okay.
[117:08.90]Well, it's got to go this way Let's need two
[117:15.68]Which ones can't be removed?
[117:17.84]Here comes the math.
[117:20.69]So can it just go through here?
[117:23.55]Can I do minus one?
[117:24.53]I can.
[117:24.87]So I don't need to replace that.
[117:29.03]Just go like this.
[117:42.06]Additional components require attention.
[117:43.68]Critical failure.
[117:45.65]No!
[117:49.19]I agree with you.
[117:50.03]No.
[117:50.47]Okay, we need minus three here so we can go... This is four, five, six.
[117:57.04]I can't remove that.
[117:58.10]Yes, I can.
[117:59.64]But, okay, hold on a second.
[118:01.00]So, look at if I go up here.
[118:06.24]Carry the two.
[118:07.08]Alright, so this is... I have to go through one of these, right?
[118:12.08]So, it's probably going to be this.
[118:15.58]I need five.
[118:17.59]So what if I did five?
[118:20.33]I don't know, five.
[118:22.97]And then we go up here.
[118:24.91]No, that's not going to work.
[118:31.26]Uh, we have to go, eventually have to go down here.
[118:33.28]Hold on.
[118:35.10]Just delete these.
[118:36.20]What if I go at five?
[118:39.68]Instead of doing that, what if I go through these and then around here?
[118:42.75]Fuck.
[118:50.46]Hold on.
[118:50.72]Let me see what happens if I do this.
[118:51.89]I just want to see if I can connect it correctly.
[118:58.09]No.
[119:00.05]This is six.
[119:04.36]I can't move that, though.
[119:05.20]It has to go through here.
[119:07.72]So this is not going to work.
[119:09.22]So it has to go up this way.
[119:10.44]It has to.
[119:19.57]Uh, let's just start with three.
[119:20.73]I just need to see how it works.
[119:29.72]Alright, so I need five, um, and then, what did, minus one?
[119:34.08]Minus one, that would make it... I need plus four?
[119:40.30]There's no plus four.
[119:42.50]So I would need to do, this is plus, I don't have a plus three.
[119:48.80]Let me just connect it to make sure I have enough pieces to do this.
[119:57.60]That's sick.
[119:58.12]So I need to do... I need to bring minus one here.
[120:01.28]So I can do +2, right?
[120:02.77]Yeah.
[120:07.33]Okay.
[120:13.93]Spike is cascading.
[120:19.04]Eight we need minus three is somewhere This already works make it like stupid for me so I can just what do I have?
[120:38.21]I Need this is gonna do more here -2 is the only other one this is gonna have to go up and around here, isn't it?
[120:48.11]Like this
[120:52.12]And then... -2 this way.
[120:55.06]And then all the way around.
[120:58.92]Wait, use the ones that are... Can only go one way.
[121:02.40]That's not one of them.
[121:06.56]Hmm.
[121:09.04]Nope.
[121:12.75]That's two and five.
[121:15.51]I have to go, like, through the other one, too.
[121:17.31]Interestingly enough.
[121:18.29]Okay, here's this.
[121:20.58]Six?
[121:21.28]No.
[121:21.94]Can I put minus?
[121:22.50]Is there any?
[121:23.32]There's only -2.
[121:24.64]There's another minus one.
[121:27.09]But can I replace this with a plus four?
[121:30.05]Okay.
[121:31.49]No, that's locked.
[121:32.79]Shit.
[121:33.05]Okay.
[121:33.69]Well, I can do that.
[121:34.37]There we go.
[121:37.52]More of this?
[121:45.46]Well, this is pretty much saying that he's losing his mind.
[121:53.26]This is bad.
[121:53.98]No, we're good.
[121:57.96]Doctor?
[122:03.75]Doctor, I've found a potential problem.
[122:06.01]Everything has problems, if you look hard enough.
[122:08.35]But fortune favors the bold.
[122:10.67]Denial.
[122:15.29]While you were looking through that iPad, I added two more.
[122:18.51]The neural web isn't isolating your motor neurons.
[122:22.29]It could be affecting other parts of your brain, your inhibitions, your mood.
[122:26.05]I just think we need some more testing.
[122:27.49]We've done enough testing!
[122:29.47]For the first time in my life, I don't feel like a failure.
[122:34.76]I feel like maybe... Uh-oh.
[122:37.42]Otto, you're not a failure.
[122:38.86]He's going all over the place.
[122:39.84]But this could permanently damage your mind.
[122:42.02]Please.
[122:46.42]Right.
[122:52.63]Right.
[122:52.89]Don't worry.
[123:01.42]He actually listened.
[123:03.26]We're close.
[123:03.72]I'll keep at it.
[123:09.07]Work out some bugs.
[123:12.41]Go.
[123:13.97]Go.
[123:15.61]You sure you're okay?
[123:18.25]Yes.
[123:24.81]Thank you, Peter.
[123:26.95]For... For everything.
[123:31.96]That sounds kind of like a... That kind of sounds like a buy.
[123:37.24]I'm going to put it back in and dial it up to 100.
[123:41.75]When I make a promise to this city, I keep it.
[123:45.83]You have no idea what you're in for
[124:15.56]Well, I just found the next boss fight.
[124:20.59]It's definitely going to be against you.
[124:27.82]He activated the bad guy mode.
[124:29.38]Yep, he did.
[124:33.28]Me?
[124:33.88]Me?
[124:37.66]And me, I'm the next boss fighter.
[124:41.66]Hey, V. Hi, Miles.
[124:43.77]I just wanted to see how you're doing with the news about Lee.
[124:46.73]Look, if you didn't want to work there anymore, May and I would understand.
[124:51.33]I can't get over the separate, complete separate script that was recorded.
[124:57.33]Exerting.
[124:59.80]That's true.
[125:00.88]Assuming he's doing the right thing.
[125:03.08]I got you that job.
[125:04.56]I'd hate for you to keep doing it if you think it's wrong.
[125:07.76]That's so fucking cool.
[125:08.48]He just changes in tone completely.
[125:41.55]What's the outfit?
[125:42.17]This is the Scarlet Spider outfit.
[125:45.11]My favorite outfit so far.
[125:53.11]I know you guys are gonna be mad I didn't try to go for the blue filter.
[125:56.11]Remember the 90s?
[125:56.53]This is a cool suit.
[126:11.44]I feel the most comfortable with this one.
[126:15.18]No frills, no bullshit, no suffocating heavy leather.
[126:20.46]This is just a nice thin suit with the logo on it.
[126:26.85]Tells you exactly who this is.
[126:29.23]Utility belt.
[126:31.41]Breathable eyes, by the way.
[126:46.33]It's got a sick hood.
[126:47.51]Yeah, it's a sick hoodie.
[126:48.37]She starts drinking it.
[126:56.05]She drags it on the same carrot that she's been cutting.
[127:12.70]No.
[127:14.30]But the Martin I know couldn't have done that.
[127:16.92]Whatever's become of him, that's not the one I want to remember.
[127:22.91]What's she making?
[127:23.87]So, how are things with MJ?
[127:27.83]It's, uh... She's, uh... It's complicated.
[127:35.73]Honesty.
[127:36.65]Why is she putting mustard on bread?
[127:39.98]There's no sandwich there.
[127:40.94]This is a stack of bread.
[127:42.18]Oh, sure.
[127:43.12]Especially when we were your age.
[127:45.72]So, are you honest with her?
[127:48.86]What's going on here?
[127:49.38]Does she know the real you?
[127:50.56]Hey, turn it up.
[127:53.62]I want to hear this.
[127:55.04]A spokesperson for the police has confirmed that this was the truck carrying the device used in the Grand Central Terminal attack.
[128:02.58]Oh, it never ends.
[128:08.27]Peter?
[128:15.24]Alright, that's my new desktop background by the way guys You think I'm fucking kidding Captain watanabe leave a message
[128:43.16]Thanks for sharing.
[128:44.58]I'm gonna get a good tip on my- No, I'm gonna crop it and scale it.
[128:47.46]It's gonna be a 3D background.
[128:50.82]Is this ever gonna go to PC?
[128:51.70]I'm gonna- I'm gonna say no.
[128:53.17]Unfortunately.
[129:14.46]Just because this is a PS4 exclusive.
[129:21.28]Did Ratchet and Clank ever go to PS4?
[129:23.12]No.
[129:23.64]This is like a purely PlayStation-only experience, I think.
[129:29.41]They did, right?
[129:30.47]Did it?
[129:31.45]Kind of?
[129:33.53]No.
[129:34.51]No Xbox.
[129:35.81]No PC.
[129:36.79]Only PlayStation 4.
[129:40.15]Okay.
[129:48.21]considering getting a PlayStation 4 just for this.
[129:51.97]There are so many experiences on PS4 that are worth a PlayStation 4.
[129:55.92]Right here.
[129:59.09]This is worth to buy, for this to be a Bloodborne machine.
[130:04.19]Every other game is just kind of, oh yeah, that's also PlayStation 4 exclusive.
[130:07.51]It doesn't matter, it's a Bloodborne machine that plays all these other great games.
[130:12.08]But that alone, it added at least two or three of their experiences that are worth buying the whole console for.
[130:25.51]Hey, take a closer look!
[130:27.98]You were supposed to kill him!
[130:51.14]10 aerial combat hits.
[130:53.16]Alright, can I do it in time?
[130:55.16]Yeah, I'll be able to do it.
[131:01.63]15, 16, 17.
[131:01.97]One more.
[131:03.61]Can I do it?
[131:04.81]18.
[131:04.83]Come on.
[131:04.99]19, 20.
[131:05.03]Got it.
[131:17.82]I can't believe Martin Lee is inspiring men to attack the police like this.
[131:21.27]I'm gonna put you on this bridge.
[131:29.59]Queensborough Bridge!
[131:30.91]I'll take a landmark token.
[131:31.97]And there's a backpack under there, too.
[131:35.55]Can't reach that from here.
[131:36.61]Come on, man.
[131:37.01]Your hand is on it, man.
[131:37.73]Come on.
[131:49.80]Yeah.
[131:50.00]God of War was amazing.
[132:15.57]Bloodborne, God of War, and Spider-Man.
[132:18.31]There are others, but those three alone, I think are actually probably worth buying this console for.
[132:26.40]The base PS4 is cheap now, isn't it?
[132:30.20]How much is a base just for PlayStation 4?
[132:31.64]I didn't play God of War?
[132:33.74]Well, that doesn't mean... It's true.
[132:34.90]But it is, arguably, everyone says it's one of the best experiences of this generation.
[132:43.70]Just going by what other people have told me, who I trust, I think.
[132:45.70]Could get a good used one.
[132:46.34]Yeah.
[132:46.46]It's at $299.
[132:46.66]Wait, a base PlayStation 4 is $400?
[132:47.72]How much is a PS4 Pro?
[132:48.26]Am I listening to music?
[132:49.68]What's with the...
[133:13.52]Wavelength, I'm right here.
[133:17.32]I still have like an intercom in my ear.
[133:20.53]Untouchable.
[133:22.11]Oh no, they're breaking out of Arkham.
[133:24.41]I think you guys need a little more plan in your escape plan.
[133:49.62]More, more, more.
[133:53.95]It's pretty bad.
[133:55.59]Who else?
[133:56.63]There's a lot of people over here.
[134:04.59]Whoa!
[134:05.59]That's one reason.
[134:07.49]Where'd they get the guns?
[134:41.87]Don't do it.
[134:46.67]Oh!
[134:46.91]I have to throw up in the head.
[134:58.65]We got two more guys this way you and got behind right up top Shadows over here by the port-a-potty Rockets into a prison
[135:23.72]Let's throw a Molotov.
[135:26.10]Oh, we got... Let's go with... Oh, the suppression.
[135:28.15]I'm going to try this.
[135:59.55]Alright.
[136:00.49]Up on the roof!
[136:04.15]Hey!
[136:08.11]All the way down.
[136:16.07]Someone's trapped behind the door.
[136:17.53]Drop this right here.
[136:28.68]Oh, that's awesome!
[136:30.22]Because you can do aerial combos too.
[136:31.88]Mother in the air.
[136:34.22]That's so cool.
[136:43.20]Door!
[136:44.40]Hold on.
[136:45.00]Who's left?
[136:46.04]What the fuck?
[136:46.74]What is this guy doing here?
[136:50.54]Get up there, man.
[137:06.08]I can't laugh this hard.
[137:14.51]It's almost like he's... I can't... I can't laugh.
[137:18.17]So many people in the air.
[137:20.47]Get over there!
[137:21.25]Come on!
[137:21.49]Yes!
[137:39.56]Web bomb, let's go!
[137:42.98]Should've done it to the bat guy.
[137:48.42]Whoa, excuse me!
[137:49.04]Let's go electricity.
[138:08.79]No execution on that guy?
[138:11.71]That seemed a little odd.
[138:12.89]Oh, because he was electrocuted to death.
[138:20.37]I get it.
[138:20.91]Through the middle!
[138:28.30]We got a sniper?
[138:29.22]I think there's a sniper over there.
[138:34.94]No, it's just this guy.
[138:46.78]I've got you, motherfucker.
[138:52.03]Bow!
[138:52.37]Through his legs, please.
[138:59.65]Through the barbed wire.
[139:00.81]Trying to get the shield.
[139:06.90]Oh, we got another stupid weapon.
[139:29.26]Last guy is right there.
[139:32.23]Oops-a-daisy.
[139:43.41]Chopper?
[139:44.47]At least I won't have to worry about them breaking out ever again.
[139:49.80]That's true.
[139:52.94]I'm wiping out like the whole prison.
[140:00.91]Why do they know how to fly a helicopter?
[140:05.90]These are some of the most highly skilled criminals I've ever seen.
[140:09.40]License and registration please!
[140:19.86]That was a perfect landing.
[140:22.30]So many things could have gone wrong right there.
[140:24.22]And it landed right in the perfect place.
[140:25.74]Didn't touch any of the other cars.
[140:26.94]No buildings.
[140:27.39]Trailer.
[140:28.15]E3.
[140:28.25]E3 Electro 2016.
[140:28.61]Whatever it was.
[140:49.49]It's weird they have the E3 moment so late in the game.
[141:05.84]I kind of like that, though.
[141:07.16]Because that means that usually with E3 presentations, it's the company saying, Hey, this is the only cool thing in the whole game.
[141:15.59]Welcome to the party!
[141:16.49]Just in time for the fight!
[141:23.23]I'm glad it happened more than half the time.
[141:28.09]Well, here we go.
[141:28.51]Let's build up some EX meter, huh?
[142:01.99]What do I have selected?
[142:06.23]Spin around.
[142:14.97]Nope.
[142:17.84]Ah, that felt good.
[142:19.52]That felt good.
[142:38.61]Woohoo!
[142:39.49]Let's go!
[142:40.67]Don't lose my combo!
[142:41.48]Don't lose my combo!
[142:42.46]Don't lose my combo!
[142:49.46]There's the real Rhino.
[142:50.36]Find and stop Electro, but not Rhino.
[143:09.53]Okay, I was like wait, why couldn't I go through it?
[143:19.62]Hey, what's your status?
[143:21.26]Me?
[143:22.16]Just trapped in prison with every criminal I put away last night.
[143:26.16]This is too good to be true.
[143:28.86]Scorpion, can you hold on a minute?
[143:30.75]I was in the middle of a phone call and it was business.
[143:41.39]So is this the climax where now I have to fight like three bosses in a row or something?
[143:48.64]I wonder if there are cannons in this game.
[143:50.80]Probably not.
[143:51.46]It would be really late to introduce somebody like that.
[143:54.28]Damn it.
[143:54.54]Whatever, just die.
[143:55.32]Give him a weapon.
[143:55.98]I don't like weapons.
[143:56.74]Oh my god, I'm getting massed up here.
[143:58.04]Oh my god, what the fuck am I doing?
[143:59.10]He's going so well.
[144:35.44]Let's keep moving.
[144:39.90]That was lucky.
[144:40.90]Where's Condiment Man?
[144:42.42]There's no Condiment Man.
[144:45.82]E3!
[144:46.20]Okay, I'll tell you one thing, though.
[145:05.29]I remember watching this during that presentation.
[145:10.75]This is what actually happens in the game, too.
[145:14.10]That's kind of rare.
[145:14.78]Vulture.
[145:20.38]Why are they all here?
[145:21.60]This kind of just came out of nowhere, didn't it?
[145:36.86]Not a good time for a call Everyone is here
[146:10.63]I'm losing the trailer poison.
[146:12.55]Oh, lots going on.
[146:14.07]No, not this shit.
[146:23.11]Where you going?
[146:31.39]Whoa!
[146:31.75]Okay, I'm good.
[146:33.57]I didn't know he was gonna do it twice in a row.
[146:39.66]Done?
[146:43.92]Oh wait, they all beat you up on the roof, and it's like, oh, what's this last reveal?
[146:47.40]I'm waiting for it.
[146:49.98]Yeah, I remember this part.
[147:07.17]They all beat you up, and then it zooms in on your face, and you go, and the trailer cut off.
[147:14.51]We're gonna get to see what happens.
[147:16.90]Who saves Spider-Man?
[147:21.42]Doc Octopus.
[147:21.80]That's my prediction.
[147:22.96]Doc Octopus is gonna come out here and be like, Spider-Man, let's be friends!
[147:30.20]And then he's a good guy.
[147:31.08]And then I'll be happy.
[147:31.99]It's gonna be cool.
[147:48.44]Yeah, they all just stomp, stomp, stomp, and then it's... It's going to be Norman Osborn.
[147:53.72]It's going to be Norman Osborn as the Green Goblin.
[147:55.06]He's going to fly in.
[147:55.98]And it's going to be the Dark Reign Norman.
[148:02.15]It's going to... It has to be, right?
[148:05.89]Yes, yes!
[148:08.47]Oh.
[148:08.99]Dr. Octavius.
[148:13.63]First and final reward.
[148:22.93]Stay out of our way.
[148:34.20]Each of you has a job to do.
[148:36.64]Your debts will be repaid when we're done.
[148:39.62]Go!
[148:40.94]Where's- where's- I want-
[148:48.11]Norman Osborn to get in the goddamn suit and to do the thing that he does without spoilers and I wanted to be here!
[148:58.82]Where is he?
[149:21.28]They need villains for the sequel.
[149:40.61]Well, Tony Stark's not in this universe, right?
[149:43.61]Technically, here, right now.
[149:46.71]No, never mind.
[149:49.41]I guess that would be... I'm confused where the storyline goes here.
[149:54.17]Holy shit, are you really doing this?
[149:59.11]Did he actually just do that?
[150:22.32]He just, he, why would you do that?
[150:30.06]Like go break into Norman Osborn's office and like punch him in the face.
[150:39.71]Yeah.
[150:39.87]Why'd you put the mask on after?
[150:44.79]I think it's too late at that point.
[150:59.61]special report on the bioterror attack.
[151:02.87]As of this hour... Jesus Christ.
[151:06.41]This is horrible.
[151:07.27]This is really horrible.
[151:08.93]Can you pass those out for me?
[151:10.57]Sure.
[151:11.31]They are working around the clock on a cure for this deadly disease.
[151:15.03]The city-wide quarantine is being heavily enforced by Sable International, who maintain tight security over all transit points.
[151:22.44]Throughout the city, police and Sable agents continue to battle with Rikers and raft escapees.
[151:28.37]Meanwhile, Mayor Osborne has gone on record blaming Spider-Man for the prison break and city-wide sickness, and branding him a fugitive.
[151:37.01]But he has yet to provide evidence.
[151:39.23]And many believe the mayor is just deflecting blame, since an exclusive report by the Bugle revealed that this disease originated in a secret, unregulated Oscorp laboratory here in Manhattan.
[151:51.04]Mayor Osborne insists that Oscorp... Turn it off!
[151:54.26]...on an anti-serum, but has not provided any further evidence to support this.
[152:07.78]Jesus God This got halfway through this game this got really really dark and uncomfortable and horrible damn
[152:30.54]Dr. Octavius, why?
[152:34.11]How did I let this happen?
[152:37.97]Just got a call from the hospital.
[152:39.83]They said you went AWOL.
[152:41.11]I need to get back to work.
[152:42.57]The doctor said you still have 14 broken bones.
[152:46.56]Which means I have 192 non-broken ones.
[152:48.78]Me and Venom get to be friends, right?
[152:50.04]Thanks for taking care of me, by the way.
[152:51.56]That's what happens in Spider-Man.
[152:53.81]When it gets too hard, Venom says, I'll help you, and they become best friends for like two episodes.
[152:58.89]I've seen the show.
[153:00.31]I've read the comics.
[153:02.91]I don't know.
[153:03.35]Feels like the end of the world.
[153:06.57]Maybe it is.
[153:11.70]People said, what?
[153:12.74]Yeah.
[153:15.15]Don't you guys don't know about that arc?
[153:18.73]Venom doesn't... Venom... It's like yin and yang.
[153:22.89]Venom has to always exist, and Spider-Man always has to exist.
[153:26.69]So when Spider-Man is in too much trouble, Venom gets angry and helps, because that's his prey.
[153:37.04]And there always has to be a Spider-Man, there always has to be a Venom.
[153:43.87]sorry I cut it off he's right no that that that's never happened maximum carnage separation anxiety there was what are you talking about that happened spider-man and venom have teamed up more than two or three times
[154:08.64]comic book nerd what that's real uh let's see increased shot by what how many tokens do I have there was a dork
[154:37.59]That's just what happens.
[154:40.78]I like these.
[154:45.54]And... And... No, I don't think anybody even knows about that shit.
[154:52.76]But the amount of people that do know, how many people don't know about the thing that I was excited for that never happened?
[154:59.06]That might happen in a future movie or something.
[155:01.63]I'm not even going to talk about it because who fucking even really pays that much attention?
[155:06.03]I'm going to write it in Master of Comedy.
[155:14.83]What's the other channel's name?
[155:21.10]Is it Master of Comedy 209?
[155:31.85]okay I'm just gonna write it here don't write it in here don't be don't be don't be an idiot okay keep all discussion of what we're about to say in this over here I'm like having two chats uh alright so I'm about to like say something very specific about like the Marvel Universe if you don't and about a very specific character that's potentially in this franchise here
[156:07.46]Like that's that's I'm looking forward to that.
[156:25.64]I don't know what that means.
[156:29.62]Yeah, like that's, that's it.
[156:31.76]Okay, I closed out when I'm no longer there.
[156:36.60]Don't you dare.
[156:37.24]Don't bring that over here.
[156:38.84]You'll be actually timed the fuck out.
[156:40.72]For real.
[156:41.98]Don't do it over in the Jerma985.
[156:43.56]You're allowed to talk about that in Master of Comedy 209.
[156:45.74]Not here.
[156:59.22]You didn't say it.
[156:59.76]Yes, I did.
[157:07.09]Air yank.
[157:08.73]Let's get this.
[157:09.95]That sounds fun.
[157:14.72]You did not post it.
[157:17.32]I did.
[157:17.74]I typed it in to enter.
[157:18.88]You actually didn't post anything.
[157:22.18]I pressed enter!
[157:24.11]Great.
[157:24.75]My men are tracking the supervillains.
[157:26.71]I'll update you when we make progress.
[157:28.67]For now, do your best to stabilize the city.
[157:45.92]Alright.
[157:50.77]You had to have seen it that time.
[157:56.93]There we go.
[157:57.63]Alright.
[157:58.79]It was seen.
[157:59.33]I didn't put it in wrong chat.
[158:07.95]I did not put it.
[158:08.71]I can see what chat I put it in.
[158:10.65]Alright.
[158:10.91]Let's go back to this.
[158:13.22]Complete Sable Outpost and Prisoner Camps to earn base tokens.
[158:21.73]Alright, but now look at the world is now... I have everyone's... it's just chaos now.
[158:28.01]We're definitely getting to the end of the game.
[158:30.11]Because the whole... all the streets are in total carnage.
[158:33.38]How am I going to collect all the backpacks and stuff?
[158:35.14]I want to be able to relax.
[158:39.18]Oh, shit.
[158:39.76]Whoops.
[158:42.91]Oh, God damn it.
[158:43.79]Let's air-yank that guy.
[158:45.07]I want to air-yank someone.
[158:46.35]You're just in such a weird place.
[159:12.66]Such a bad drill.
[159:15.28]Alright, I can't even get that backpack.
[159:17.44]I'm more worried about you.
[159:19.18]Oh, no, don't even do that.
[159:21.08]Beast is the safest place in the city right now.
[159:24.00]Our sister locations uptown aren't so much.
[159:27.89]Spider plushie!
[159:30.35]A toy designer made this prototype to get me to license my likeness.
[159:34.31]Too bad there's no way to get paid without revealing my identity.
[159:39.61]Imagine that.
[159:40.62]What a terrible fucking life this is, huh?
[159:43.74]Spider-Man is a superhero.
[159:46.30]Peter Parker is broke and gets evicted.
[159:50.03]You can't tell people you're Spider-Man, and you can't take the potentially hundreds of millions of dollars in licensing fees.
[159:58.05]Peter Parker's not getting any money for this game.
[160:00.63]Somebody made a video game about him.
[160:02.87]It's just, there's no copyright here.
[160:07.15]These companies could just print money.
[160:08.41]The plushie company could print money.
[160:09.90]You don't have to pay any licensing fees.
[160:12.94]Alright, so now... I don't really have a task here.
[160:26.54]All units, report some active snipers in the area.
[160:30.98]He chooses.
[160:32.23]He could.
[160:32.55]He chooses not to.
[160:33.39]Tony Stark does it.
[160:35.89]Tony Stark is a billionaire already.
[160:40.23]So he doesn't have to take the paycheck.
[160:42.89]The guy owns a billion dollar company.
[160:49.95]Peter Parker is like a college kid.
[160:56.76]I guess I'm just gonna attack some people.
[161:00.14]Like
[161:04.26]And we've still got somebody walking down the street with an umbrella.
[161:09.26]Ah, this is a good day to go for a walk.
[161:14.11]The whole world is, like, on fire.
[161:22.95]Is there something specific I need to be doing right now, or just kind of explore the destroyed, like, area?
[161:30.88]Tombstone on the move.
[161:34.03]I need to find out what Tombstone is doing.
[161:37.39]I'll just do it.
[161:37.87]Might as well.
[161:41.09]I got nothing else I can do.
[161:48.63]Yep.
[161:50.07]Spider-Man, the Raft MVPs are back on the grid, laying siege to our police precincts.
[161:55.42]My men need your help.
[161:56.84]Now, get to a vantage point in Midtown and I'll explain.
[162:00.36]On my way.
[162:01.00]Is it Arcadius?
[162:01.70]No.
[162:07.22]I have to be honest.
[162:08.92]That one scares me.
[162:10.71]Might be the smartest supervillain I've ever encountered.
[162:13.27]Yeah, that's what I'm worried about.
[162:15.51]Hold tight, Captain.
[162:20.93]Let's do this.
[162:23.33]Tombstone on the move.
[162:26.07]What's a flunky?
[162:45.22]Wait, what happened?
[162:46.04]While I'm here, I should examine the transmitter MJ found.
[162:50.88]You put... Somebody said I put my spoiler in the wrong channel.
[162:57.68]It doesn't matter what Master of Comedy 2-0-something channel.
[163:02.10]They're all...
[163:04.01]Like, when I said that and I made Master of Comedy 2-0-whatever, everybody else made a Master of Comedy, so it doesn't even matter.
[163:14.78]It's as long as it was Master of Comedy 2 and then random numbers.
[163:20.32]It's somebody here.
[163:20.96]Oh, damn it.
[163:40.31]I don't think I'll ever do this one.
[163:47.85]I already... I have been... Did I get it?
[163:56.37]Fuck.
[163:57.73]I think I got it.
[164:12.82]Now we have a mission.
[164:14.10]Let's go do it.
[164:20.96]Okay, somebody's shooting rockets at me.
[164:30.43]And land.
[164:31.57]Launch!
[164:33.11]Speed.
[164:34.91]That's like anti-Spider-Man guns now, pointed in the air.
[164:50.10]Okay captain guys on fill me in rhinos assaulting the Upper West Precinct Electro is at the Upper East.
[165:12.97]We need you to turn the tide.
[165:14.57]This is an either They're both equally screwed
[165:17.59]Both equally screwed.
[165:18.74]Alright, well, this one's closer by 100 meters, so we're gonna go over here.
[165:33.73]Too many things to do.
[165:35.01]Oh, Jesus.
[165:35.37]Oh, my God.
[165:35.67]I'm not even paid.
[165:36.37]I'm not even paid to do this.
[166:04.96]This is so exhausting for a person.
[166:06.94]This is too much.
[166:09.02]I can't do everything.
[166:10.57]Where's Venom?
[166:11.57]Call Venom.
[166:12.35]Hey, Venom, look.
[166:15.93]I know we've had some problems.
[166:17.25]But we've helped each other before.
[166:19.51]You were friends for two episodes for me before.
[166:23.20]Can you just go kill Rhino for me?
[166:28.79]Just, I don't care.
[166:29.79]Like, no, no, no.
[166:30.61]Oh, no.
[166:31.01]Arrest him.
[166:31.41]No, just go kill him.
[166:32.65]Like, I know that's what you like.
[166:34.21]Just go do it.
[166:35.52]Just give me, help me out here.
[166:37.66]Let's see what we gotta do here.
[166:53.04]How does Shocker fly?
[166:54.05]Static electricity.
[166:56.29]You know how your hair stands on your head with static electricity?
[167:01.09]It's trying to fly away.
[167:01.95]It's trying to go in the air.
[167:02.97]Okay, well.
[167:03.49]Let's do something about this.
[167:04.83]L2 and aim are when destroy transformers.
[167:24.65]Alright, that's not what I would assume you'd have to do to destroy a transplant.
[167:41.20]Let's go get this next one.
[167:43.72]Don't touch the electrified buildings.
[167:45.36]That should be obvious.
[168:06.50]See you later.
[168:08.74]Alright.
[168:09.66]Whoa, watch out for that.
[168:12.88]And just like that, Spider-Man died.
[168:15.19]A lot of close calls over the years, Spider-Man.
[168:17.51]You jumped at the wrong time.
[168:44.15]Just brought him back over here.
[168:52.60]What?
[168:52.88]You didn't get affected by that?
[168:55.28]Whoops-a-daisy.
[168:58.32]Really?
[169:00.98]I gotta wait till he attacks.
[169:10.01]Get rid of him.
[169:12.04]And get rid of the Transformer!
[169:20.36]This last one is in the air over here.
[169:24.23]Wait, hold on a second.
[169:28.89]I can get rid of the helicopter then, can't I?
[169:34.49]I'll get it last.
[170:01.65]Holy shit.
[170:03.65]Oh my god.
[170:28.79]Okay, so far so good.
[170:30.83]I just want to cross the whole map there.
[170:34.29]Alright, gotta just get the one on the helicopter.
[170:48.50]Up there.
[170:52.30]Too far.
[170:55.24]Police are free, but demons aren't backing down.
[170:57.24]Need to lend a hand.
[171:20.50]In any real scenario, that guy smashes his head on the dashboard.
[171:25.36]And he ain't getting it this far.
[171:37.89]Back to it!
[171:42.37]Let's get some spiders out here.
[172:00.97]One more spider!
[172:03.65]Can you not use that move with the guitar feedback sound, please?
[172:15.64]You don't like the guitar sound?
[172:19.94]Wait, you don't know how to use the guitar?
[172:36.99]Yuri, your men are safe.
[172:38.43]What's next?
[172:39.59]Get to the upper west side.
[172:41.13]We're trying to shoot civilians, but Rhino isn't making it easy.
[172:44.37]We're trying to help civilians.
[172:46.19]We've noticed that it looks like there's a dark blue figure flying through the city shooting laser beams at Rhino.
[172:53.59]We can't tell who he is.
[172:54.49]Things in the veteran center are not good.
[172:57.92]Convicts are trying to break down the doors.
[172:59.94]Mary Jane's here, but we're getting people out of the basement.
[173:02.70]We need more help.
[173:03.42]I hope you can get here soon.
[173:05.52]I need to finish with the precincts fast and get to Harlem.
[173:13.01]Don't use webs.
[173:14.09]I don't like it.
[173:15.85]I don't like the sound of webs.
[173:28.22]Any available units?
[173:29.40]Officer vehicle is under fire.
[173:31.14]I am not an available unit.
[173:31.98]Any officers near firehouse, please copy.
[173:41.21]Come on, it's Rhino.
[173:42.43]You can't do anything about it.
[173:43.57]Gotta get him in the exposed bits.
[174:03.12]That was... That was so bad.
[174:05.08]That was as... That was fucking medieval reenactment bad.
[174:07.48]I can't.
[174:07.88]That was awful.
[174:08.54]I have to use the guitar.
[174:11.22]I have to.
[174:33.47]I'm sorry.
[174:33.89]That guy doesn't like it.
[174:42.86]Where am I?
[174:51.64]That slow roll.
[174:53.86]I can't.
[174:59.04]Where are you?
[175:11.41]Really
[175:36.61]I gotta get underneath.
[175:41.60]Where'd you get that shield, man?
[175:50.35]You shouldn't have this.
[175:58.71]Don't take those guys in the air, that's what I remember!
[176:02.57]Last guy.
[176:03.29]I mean, you're gonna block it anyways.
[176:05.35]Come on, go for it.
[176:07.74]No, I was waiting for it, but I missed it.
[176:12.06]Go!
[176:12.80]Nope, it's in streak.
[176:41.86]That flashbang sucks.
[176:53.13]What the fuck is happening?
[177:02.90]Alright, who's left?
[177:06.56]You?
[177:15.35]There's more to do!
[177:18.81]How much more is there?
[177:19.81]Spider-Man, I'm stuck!
[177:22.65]Don't think they're locking RPGs!
[177:24.05]They'll break down the building!
[177:25.17]I'm not gonna let that happen.
[177:26.57]I'm on it.
[177:31.64]Back this way, again.
[177:32.48]Alright, we're good.
[177:33.28]One roof clear.
[177:34.09]Just gotta do this, like, 30 more times.
[177:41.79]Should I hit ban this guy?
[178:04.12]I missed.
[178:05.80]It's okay, we're going this way anyway.
[178:07.60]There's too many, too many people.
[178:11.16]There's too many people that need help.
[178:17.64]Okay, is this roof not clear?
[178:19.58]Not quite.
[178:21.10]What the fuck?
[178:26.90]Priority target acquired.
[178:28.33]Proceeding to pacify.
[178:29.75]There are easier ways to ask for an autograph.
[178:33.09]Jetpacks.
[178:34.54]Jesus!
[178:34.70]Jesus!
[178:34.88]Jesus!
[178:35.16]They're still shooting rockets!
[178:36.15]Ohohoho!
[179:07.44]Oh, my lord.
[179:08.76]You guys gotta go now.
[179:29.41]Goddamn.
[179:32.61]Not in the air.
[179:33.93]Lord.
[180:32.10]That's it for Sable's airborne commandos.
[180:35.22]Now to mop up the rest of the Riker's escapees.
[180:41.66]Over here on this side.
[180:42.64]Where is it?
[180:43.42]Who's left?
[180:43.80]I don't see anybody here.
[180:49.64]Oh.
[180:54.40]Okay.
[180:54.78]I did it.
[180:56.69]That was wild.
[180:57.97]How?
[180:58.57]How is it possible?
[181:08.50]Yeah, sorry.
[181:11.12]I need to sign off for a bit.
[181:17.50]I single-handedly just have to take care of hundreds of people with machine guns and rockets and superpowers and people with jetpacks.
[181:25.69]I went... Like, my Fitbit says I traveled around 68 miles today.
[181:28.79]I think I can take a break.
[181:30.04]Oh, my God.
[181:30.46]No, I can't.
[181:38.50]Stay where you are, MJ.
[181:39.71]I'll handle this.
[181:40.89]Damn it.
[181:41.59]Move it, Pete.
[181:42.51]Move!
[181:51.37]One more mile, please.
[181:52.67]Let me get this on, yeah.
[182:18.00]of all the places to hook on to.
[182:22.08]Right into the fire.
[182:25.57]That's what kills him, of all the stuff.
[182:28.47]Peter, fire and rescue's on the way.
[182:30.29]I found a fire escape that'll get me.
[182:32.35]MJ, stay back.
[182:33.47]I don't want to have to rescue you, too.
[182:35.05]Peter, don't be crazy.
[182:36.29]Wait for help.
[182:36.81]Alright.
[182:41.33]May!
[182:42.15]May!
[182:51.69]Miles and Mae.
[182:56.54]It's going on, Spock!
[183:17.73]I saw the green and I was like, is he actually going to help us?
[183:21.13]Come on, you stupid piece of... Oh, shit.
[183:27.83]Come on, Mei.
[183:30.32]I've got you.
[183:35.30]Oh, my God.
[183:38.34]Go!
[183:39.36]Go!
[183:44.79]Miles, come on!
[183:49.73]You did it.
[183:56.42]No!
[184:01.18]Should've taken a screenshot there.
[184:15.09]So Miles is the reason why Spider-Man's alive, huh?
[184:23.24]Just take me back to the house.
[184:25.74]I just want to watch Netflix for a couple hours.
[184:28.80]Fuck!
[184:29.46]I just want to watch another episode of Doctor Who.
[184:36.35]I've only seen episode one and I've wanted to watch it for like the last six years.
[184:56.21]doctor who's not on Netflix anymore see look at how long it's been right that he doesn't know that mj if it weren't for you and miles I would have been as dead as I would have been the last eight and a half thousand times you saved me pretty sure I still owe you a few that's smart hey
[185:20.50]I'm sorry I screwed things up.
[185:24.40]It's just... ...hard being the one who always gets saved, you know?
[185:29.24]Sometimes I wanna do the saving.
[185:31.51]I'm sorry I made you feel like you couldn't.
[185:34.71]Still partners?
[185:36.83]Always.
[185:40.15]So I didn't know if you wanted sparkling or flat or spring or mountain spring.
[185:48.94]So I got one of each.
[185:50.86]Mountain spring, Miles.
[185:51.92]Come on.
[185:53.96]Am I interrupting?
[185:55.12]No.
[185:55.94]MJ, Ms.
[185:57.42]Watson, and I were just talking strategy.
[186:01.75]Strategy?
[186:02.53]That's right.
[186:03.91]The city is in danger.
[186:05.49]It needs our help.
[186:06.57]All of our help.
[186:09.16]Alright, we'll call the play, Coach.
[186:12.18]Okay... ...divide and conquer.
[186:16.75]Ms.
[186:16.95]Watson... ...we need an anti-serum for Devil's Breath.
[186:20.89]Oscorp's developing something, but... ...there's no way they can keep it safe from Octavius and Lee.
[186:26.65]We need to find the cure... ...and protect it.
[186:29.17]I'll chase down some leads.
[186:30.13]Miles... ...you need to be my eyes and ears at feast.
[186:36.10]Anything goes wrong, call me.
[186:37.44]Pajama suit, it's the best one.
[186:38.68]We need to keep that place and the people there safe.
[186:41.24]Alright, you got it.
[186:42.68]What are you gonna do?
[186:44.74]Gang of costumed nutjobs is taking the city apart piece by piece.
[186:48.98]Time I return the favor.
[186:51.34]Alright.
[186:52.80]Hey, wait, um... How do I call you?
[186:56.70]I mean, do you have like a cell phone in your... in your pockets or something?
[187:01.71]Ms.
[187:01.91]Watson can give you my number.
[187:04.50]Good luck, team.
[187:05.58]That is true, though.
[187:07.10]That's a very great question.
[187:10.38]How do I get in touch with you?
[187:11.38]You have his number.
[187:11.84]Are you Spider-Man's girlfriend?
[187:12.96]That'd be so cool.
[187:16.34]Come on, Sherlock.
[187:17.92]Show me what you got in this Waters mortgage board.
[187:20.40]Are you Spider-Man's girlfriend?
[187:33.27]Alright, it's going to be a level up.
[187:35.44]It is.
[187:35.64]29, 30.
[187:36.28]New suit.
[187:38.12]This looks classic to me.
[187:38.96]No, it doesn't.
[187:39.50]Never mind.
[188:02.25]Spider-Man 2099.
[188:03.95]That's the future.
[188:04.77]That's not classic at all.
[188:06.19]That's the opposite of classic.
[188:10.34]Decrease gravity while in the air.
[188:12.20]That's kind of cool.
[188:19.00]This is not... That's not black.
[188:21.50]Black suit.
[188:24.28]No, I'm staying with the... I'm staying with the casual Friday suit.
[188:33.34]I do have new mods, though.
[188:35.50]Absorb some incoming damage without resetting the combo counter.
[188:38.61]I like that.
[188:39.97]Reduce incoming blast and rocket damage.
[188:41.97]I like this one.
[188:44.05]We're going to put this one on instead of this one.
[188:49.50]What do we need for that?
[188:53.42]Hold on.
[188:55.00]Alright, we got surprise deck.
[188:56.42]Upgrades web strike takedown moves so that nearby enemies are knocked back.
[189:00.90]You can throw now the weapon back at the person that you pulled it from.
[189:05.62]Slows time right before you take a fatal hit.
[189:09.79]After leaping off an enemy or from air combat, press square and X to smash the ground with force.
[189:17.43]So after you can either transition to somebody else or you can just come down and stun everybody.
[189:22.67]Okay, what about this one?
[189:23.85]Bunker Buster.
[189:25.37]Swing Kick will now knock over shield enemies.
[189:27.69]That's really good.
[189:28.75]What's the final upgrade here?
[189:31.13]Air launch attacks knockback nearby enemies has a short recharge time.
[189:42.90]I feel like this is probably more useful at the moment.
[189:46.85]Or this.
[189:50.45]Yeah, I think this is more useful.
[189:52.41]Because there's a lot of people around being in the air and then just crashing down.
[189:56.85]I think I like that a little better with someone after it.
[189:59.97]Ground strike has a larger blast.
[190:02.95]And it's now better when you use it from higher distances.
[190:06.27]So can I just do that now?
[190:07.47]Or does it have to be after leaping off an enemy?
[190:12.35]Or from air combat.
[190:13.29]Okay.
[190:13.87]So I can't just do it.
[190:14.83]I guess I can do it after this.
[190:17.09]I can just turn it on from here.
[190:19.30]That's pretty cool.
[190:22.07]Let's see.
[190:22.37]Payback.
[190:22.79]Press triangle after perfect dodging.
[190:24.82]Rifle and pistol enemies for an instant takedown.
[190:28.40]And then immediately perform a second finisher on basic enemies.
[190:34.74]Ugh.
[190:37.41]Ugh.
[190:39.89]Two.
[190:41.17]Five.
[190:42.73]Eight.
[190:43.27]Oh.
[190:45.37]Well, I kind of want this really bad now.
[190:48.58]Okay.
[190:48.86]Well, that's fine.
[190:50.03]Let's go.
[190:50.45]The intern.
[190:51.53]Well.
[190:51.67]Now you can earn that promotion.
[190:53.99]Earn that job.
[190:54.37]He will earn it.
[190:54.85]For sure.
[191:12.89]He's still doing his podcast.
[191:14.23]Stolen vehicle.
[191:14.93]What?
[191:15.07]I mean, it is right here.
[191:15.99]No, I didn't...
[191:47.09]Get off the car, what are you doing?
[191:53.84]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[192:00.34]Crime token.
[192:01.63]Thank you.
[192:04.85]No crime token.
[192:06.25]I guess this is what they call organized crime.
[192:10.03]Let's try it out.
[192:15.39]Through the bus station.
[192:20.65]How are you?
[192:22.85]Come back down.
[192:40.97]Why don't we do that again?
[192:43.07]Prime token.
[192:45.39]Only one?
[192:45.83]That didn't take any damage.
[192:48.61]Come on.
[192:50.87]That didn't take any damage.
[192:54.41]Nope.
[192:57.72]We're going to do the mission.
[193:05.60]It's got me locked on.
[193:07.71]Is this thing following me?
[193:08.85]I don't see a trail.
[193:11.79]It is following me.
[193:13.55]It's right there.
[193:18.00]Okay, I have to go in the air a little bit.
[193:19.56]I lost it.
[193:32.54]I got shot once swinging towards the car.
[193:35.27]Did I?
[193:37.55]Yes.
[193:37.69]How come I don't need a mask?
[193:42.81]Is that because of the spider blood?
[194:04.45]Norman Osborn, a better mayor for a better New York.
[194:10.53]Residue.
[194:12.59]Oh, no.
[194:14.15]Okay, well, this is going to be easier.
[194:24.70]Wait, I just... Hold on.
[194:26.20]If two absorption lines overlap, they combine into a thicker absorption line.
[194:33.30]Alright, so we got... I need two thick ones here and here, and then a thin one in the middle.
[194:39.94]So... I'm thinking... I'm thinking this... Nope.
[194:46.61]Is this one lined up?
[194:48.49]And then this one.
[194:49.63]This would be two... That would be... That would be correct.
[194:52.93]And then, like, this.
[194:54.81]And then this one.
[194:57.01]No.
[194:57.47]Well, you fucked it up.
[195:00.50]That was correct.
[195:07.52]Let's go this way.
[195:08.30]Find the right one.
[195:09.30]Um... This is...
[195:29.98]Another follow-the-string to find the electricity box.
[195:33.57]Into the trash?
[195:34.97]No.
[195:35.85]Maybe the other one went this way.
[195:37.11]Better not be a dead end.
[195:39.67]This is a far way to go for a dead end.
[196:01.02]Found it.
[196:26.12]I hope this mask protects against it.
[196:29.72]Me too.
[196:33.56]Investigate Otto's lair.
[196:35.34]It is dark down here.
[196:45.94]He went from following the cloud to following to find the fuse box.
[196:56.45]Probably.
[196:56.89]Which is why we need to stop him.
[197:26.65]Looks like Otto's been studying Sable's tech for weaknesses.
[197:32.87]What plans?
[197:33.39]I thought that was a chainsaw.
[197:34.91]It's just a floodlight.
[197:35.75]Alright, here we go.
[197:37.53]Norman.
[197:39.06]I feel like I can't turn around without seeing his face.
[197:41.90]He smiles for the cameras, collects his accolades, and keeps his boot heel pressed against my neck.
[197:48.62]Why can't anyone else see how selfish he is?
[197:50.82]How reckless?
[197:52.24]How evil?
[197:54.64]If only they could be made to see the Norman I know.
[197:57.58]The man behind the mask.
[198:01.80]Okay.
[198:09.49]Well, there's more stuff.
[198:11.03]Good old Rhino.
[198:12.23]My second favorite Russian.
[198:15.49]More audio tapes.
[198:16.38]Looks like Otto recorded messages for his crew.
[198:22.02]What's with this whole jigsaw bullshit?
[198:24.62]Alexi, I've followed your career with great interest.
[198:27.91]See?
[198:28.59]The world sees you as a witless dullard.
[198:31.67]I see a warrior with a poet's heart.
[198:35.21]I know you desire freedom from the battle suit you're sealed inside.
[198:39.42]Help me achieve my goals, and freedom shall be yours.
[198:49.68]Everybody's gonna have a tape Mac Gargan aka scorpion aka crazy pants McCrazy What's his tape say
[199:02.65]It's rare for me to admit this, Mr. Gargan.
[199:05.92]Clearing your debts was more difficult than I anticipated.
[199:09.90]You're in a ruse to some demanding individuals.
[199:14.18]But... Doesn't he have no money?
[199:15.70]Once the reservoir job is finished, your financial obligations will be finished as well.
[199:21.92]I thought he was out of money.
[199:22.86]This is nothing if not persuasive.
[199:25.14]Oh, persuasive.
[199:25.86]Okay, I get it.
[199:31.00]Wait, I'm about to find my tape.
[199:34.55]Spider-Man.
[199:35.32]Old man Vulture.
[199:37.18]I've tangled with him more than anyone else here.
[199:41.76]He has a confessional love tape to me.
[199:44.30]You'll find this one day.
[199:46.35]This is your tape.
[199:46.93]Adrian, what bitter irony that your miraculous wings should have brought such horrors on your body.
[199:54.43]Thankfully, you are now working for me.
[199:57.77]When our work is settled, the treatment I've developed will cure you.
[200:02.74]You won't shuffle off this mortal coil just yet, my friend.
[200:14.39]How much of five tape recorders?
[200:16.10]Power source for Vulture's wings gave him spinal cancer.
[200:19.72]And Otto's developing an experimental treatment to save him.
[200:23.48]Because each one of those tapes has two or three sentences on them.
[200:29.19]Couldn't you just got everybody in a room and done a Wizard of Oz end of the movie scenario?
[200:33.63]Will you?
[200:35.73]Vulture!
[200:36.47]Vulture, yes, come here.
[200:37.41]You thought that you needed this, but this is what you have.
[200:39.57]I'll take care of you here.
[200:41.60]You spent a bunch of money for no reason.
[200:47.02]Electro.
[200:48.24]Total live wire, that one.
[200:56.09]Max.
[200:57.23]When you first conveyed your dream to me, I thought you insane.
[201:00.69]Pure energy.
[201:03.73]But as I dove deeper into the problem, I discovered a way to give us both what we desire.
[201:09.50]I promise you, when we are done, you will be pure energy.
[201:14.66]Or so close to it as to make the difference irrelevant.
[201:20.84]Cool.
[201:23.11]Cool.
[201:23.39]Electro's big pipe dream is to become pure energy.
[201:27.09]Doc actually managed to modify his harness to get a little closer to that goal.
[201:32.56]Pure energy.
[201:33.60]I mean, who wants the heart in this scenario?
[201:43.01]Everybody has the thing that they want.
[201:44.23]Where's the guy that wants the brain?
[201:49.80]Electro, you've had courage all along.
[201:51.88]He was inside of you forever.
[201:55.08]What am I doing?
[201:55.42]That's me.
[201:55.74]I'm not part of the Synergy Six.
[202:07.40]But what does Doc Otto want?
[202:09.96]He's the wizard.
[202:11.14]He already got what he wanted.
[202:16.77]There's more.
[202:19.25]There's a backpack over here.
[202:20.35]Wait, no there's not.
[202:22.69]Do I have to examine... Do I have to actually examine everything?
[202:40.57]Scorpions helping Otto in exchange for a clean slate criminal record expunged gambling debts erased Gambling debts Something else over here UV bulb
[203:09.80]I'm going to turn the lights off, probably.
[203:13.84]I'm going to get the lamp turned on.
[203:22.51]Okay.
[203:26.21]Easy enough.
[203:28.05]There we go.
[203:34.64]Hidden markings.
[203:36.58]Otto's tasked the villains to destroy Oscorp holdings throughout the city.
[203:41.16]He's trying to take apart Norman's empire piece by piece.
[203:45.96]Seems like the last stage of the plan is a direct assault on Oscorp, and most likely Norman.
[203:55.68]What's Vulture doing in Times Square?
[203:58.30]Electro's disabling Oscorp power plants.
[204:00.76]Rhino's targeting Oscorp shoreline properties.
[204:03.30]Scorpion must be trying to poison the city's reservoir.
[204:06.74]Lee's going after the Devil's Breath Antiserum.
[204:09.68]Using something called Icarus?
[204:13.40]Alright.
[204:17.87]That's all we need to know.
[204:22.41]That was a good investigation.
[204:23.71]Now let's go look at the...
[204:26.69]Something over here.
[204:28.47]Briefcase.
[204:29.57]Here's your tape.
[204:30.63]Wait, this is a live feed?
[204:34.27]He was just being quiet with a webcam on.
[204:36.11]Waiting.
[204:57.53]Man, that wasn't pre-recorded.
[205:00.39]Meet a legend!
[205:04.69]So refreshing to work for a man like Octavius!
[205:08.00]Backup plans for his backup plans!
[205:13.96]Are you okay?
[205:14.68]What's happening?
[205:18.95]Traffic's rough.
[205:20.13]Listen, Lee's gunning for the anti-serum.
[205:22.71]We need to find Oscorp's Devil's Breath lab before he does.
[205:26.09]On it right now.
[205:26.75]I'm calling every building permit in the city.
[205:29.69]If there's a record of the lab, I'll find it.
[205:31.52]That's great.
[205:33.04]Okay.
[205:33.74]Talk soon, MJ.

[206:14.62]What do here?
[206:15.24]Could I just grab him?
[206:16.48]Oops-a-daisy.
[206:16.92]What do we got?
[206:18.18]Throw shit at him?
[206:18.84]Okay.
[206:20.98]Uh, looking for stuff to throw.
[206:39.86]Well, that's how it works.
[206:44.22]Use my web shooters.
[206:51.00]I need to get him close and do some real damage.
[206:58.04]I can damage him if I web the Transformer.
[207:00.88]Transformer!
[207:07.85]Beast!
[207:08.43]Yara!
[207:10.55]Let's go around.
[207:11.17]I'm not leaving the mission.
[207:13.30]I'm just getting in a better position.
[207:16.14]Whoa!
[207:16.50]I gotta grab him when he goes by.
[207:45.64]No!
[207:46.10]I'm not closing up!
[207:48.20]Oh, too bad.
[207:52.94]I gotta get up a lot higher.
[207:54.00]I'm so... There we go.
[207:58.12]Well, oh, there's more.
[208:00.40]There we go.
[208:05.51]Spider-Man!
[208:06.97]I must break you!
[208:10.25]You got it!
[208:11.67]You got my joke!
[208:13.11]I'm so happy I can almost stop fighting!
[208:15.54]Almost!
[208:17.74]Jesus.
[208:18.54]Gotta be honest.
[208:19.52]Liked it better when you two were loners.
[208:23.00]Execution!
[208:24.20]Amazing what a little teamwork can achieve, ain't it?
[208:29.29]It really is two for the price of one.
[208:30.83]The wisdom of experience, a fine pairing.
[208:34.33]Just like oil and water.
[208:37.95]Got it.
[208:42.51]Watch out for Electro!
[208:48.63]Take out the guy that flies first.
[208:56.44]That's what I would do.
[208:59.86]Did I get it?
[209:02.04]Ooh, I did not.
[209:02.86]Right here.
[209:07.96]Line it up for it.
[209:09.82]No, he didn't throw it.
[209:10.66]Damn it, come on.
[209:14.24]Shit!
[209:14.83]Well, I guess he is just standing still.
[209:18.61]Why take out the guy?
[209:19.41]Take out the guy that is not moving.
[209:20.67]Can I throw it at him?
[209:24.61]I did get it.
[209:33.60]Watch it!
[209:44.16]What?
[209:44.34]I'm not in range?
[209:46.10]Watch out for that stun.
[209:48.02]Got it.
[209:52.74]I love how they're communicating with each other.
[210:10.27]They're encouraging each other.
[210:11.45]What a good team.
[210:13.15]Oh, shit.
[210:27.12]Makes it feel like real people.
[210:28.40]Like, nice job, man.
[210:29.82]You got it, man.
[210:40.40]That hurts.
[210:41.08]Crush him into a wall.
[210:42.08]Oh.
[210:42.22]Alright, he's done.
[210:46.41]That's gotta be it for him.
[211:09.39]One down and one to go.
[211:13.12]How many times have we done this dance, Adrian?
[211:15.44]A dozen?
[211:16.20]Two dozen?
[211:17.80]One, two, three, execute.
[211:20.24]You going to throw something?
[211:22.18]Or is he out of time?
[211:25.99]No, I went right through.
[211:59.55]Now Rhino and Mr. Negative Electro's been grounded
[212:06.92]He said it.
[212:07.26]Everybody in chat said that, too.
[212:07.98]We did it, chat.
[212:08.34]Oh, Rhino and Scorpion, right.
[212:09.02]That was really fun.
[212:34.25]I thought I was going to be disappointed with the whole, hey, we're at the end of the game and here's two bosses.
[212:40.15]It was pretty cool.
[213:01.18]This is not the end of the game.
[213:03.29]So after you stop Dr. Octavius?
[213:05.91]I mean, they haven't introduced any other enemies so far.
[213:08.74]I have to assume this is probably at the last third of the game, right?
[213:16.16]Need to update Yuri.
[213:19.61]Yuri, Vulture and Electro are down.
[213:22.51]Four to go.
[213:23.78]I saw.
[213:24.60]Also noticed a rooftop in Times Square exploded.
[213:27.71]Wouldn't happen to be related, would it?
[213:29.85]Nothing gets by you.
[213:30.77]It was Octavius' staging ground.
[213:33.49]He's using the villains to pull apart Oscorp.
[213:36.17]Vulture and Electro were targeting power plants.
[213:38.71]Scorpion's going after water treatment.
[213:41.13]Still in New York.
[213:42.51]Something along the shoreline.
[213:46.46]Yeah City's already on the brink.
[213:50.78]We lose clean water.
[213:51.62]We might never come back.
[213:53.17]I'll update you when I make progress Sounds like a plan Boink I got a new suit
[214:13.61]What's this one?
[214:14.67]Iron Spider Suit.
[214:17.15]Here's the Iron Man suit.
[214:21.55]Also known as the Marvel card holographic card.
[214:27.20]You get the hologram Spider-Man card.
[214:28.78]I loved it.
[214:29.92]Wreck havoc with four articulated arms made from rapidly grown mono-atomic iron alloy crystals.
[214:40.91]I need three base tokens for this.
[214:46.12]Okay.
[214:47.96]Do I have enough to do these things that I want to know?
[214:49.80]I need challenge.
[214:50.36]I need more tokens.
[214:53.46]I have only one skill point, which I can't do anything with.
[214:56.70]One base.
[214:59.43]That's not good.
[215:11.96]So you can activate that one if you want.
[215:14.36]Okay.
[215:14.66]So what do I need for... Let's get that suit.
[215:16.20]That suit looks really cool.
[215:18.39]What does it require?
[215:19.71]Three base tokens.
[215:20.31]I have everything else.
[215:21.15]Let's go to a base.
[215:21.89]Okay, so we have one down here.
[215:43.04]mission is this way so let's do this space there's also a tower here that I haven't unlocked somehow uh let's okay I'm gonna find all that goes double for me nobody can make that woman take a break when she doesn't want definitely a base but I'll do my best thanks miles give me my love and be safe
[216:07.10]Where's the tower?
[216:18.07]This is not a base.
[216:19.31]This is not a base, but I get... Takedown tent.
[216:23.63]I need to do stealth takedowns.
[216:34.20]Why's the guy upstairs want to investigate that, but not the guy over here?
[217:04.64]Really?
[217:11.54]Really?
[217:13.36]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[217:17.51]I want to pull the stealth.
[217:18.73]Get him up here.
[217:21.72]Not... He's too far away to do that?
[217:24.54]Really?
[217:27.62]How are you that... Should be able to pull him up.
[217:35.51]I want to, like, pull... Web Strike is a stealth takedown.
[217:37.57]Yeah, but I don't want to dive down in the middle.
[217:39.51]I was trying to pull him up and wrap him around.
[217:41.23]Wasn't an option, though.
[217:42.93]I got a guy up there.
[217:43.59]Uh...
[218:00.49]Couldn't walk.
[218:16.68]That was equally cool.
[218:17.92]I'm okay with that.
[218:21.74]That was fucking fun.
[218:22.76]Alright, let's keep going.
[218:33.71]One more.
[218:35.39]Yank down ten enemies.
[218:37.93]That's just in combat.
[218:40.52]So I can do one more from here, I think, and then just start yanking people.
[218:43.62]I don't want to get the whole base.
[218:48.76]I might as well try to clear out as much as I can, right?
[218:51.04]Without being seen or heard.
[218:53.51]So yeah, we're going to go this way.
[218:58.61]Yeah, this is what I wanted to do.
[219:17.11]And here we go.
[219:25.09]Whoa.
[219:28.37]I want that gun from you, sir.
[219:30.20]Mm-hmm.
[219:49.31]Five more of those Yanks.
[219:55.60]Don't throw the grenade.
[219:56.36]Be an idiot.
[220:10.26]Last one.
[220:11.09]I'll do a view.
[220:15.61]And let's go!
[220:31.97]Let's look at a guy in the corners.
[220:43.82]I just took a lot of damage.
[220:48.26]Holy shit, that guy is a good sniper.
[220:56.80]That's all of them.
[220:58.22]Let's find out what they were up to.
[221:02.95]That guy hit me in the ear twice.
[221:03.85]500 widow.
[221:04.01]Break him up.
[221:27.09]wave two when you were little did you say I'm gonna grow up and be a fascist oppressor yeah you probably did alright we need to do some electric rock in here oh god alright that guy you got the machine gun here man and I don't like it

[222:47.18]Hey, I didn't make it.
[222:48.56]Didn't quite make it.
[222:51.06]Let's get drones out here.
[223:03.30]Uh, switch to this.
[223:05.34]Didn't get him?
[223:06.54]Oh, come on.
[223:06.90]It's because he has a weapon?
[223:17.54]Who's shooting at me?
[223:23.81]That is what's happening.
[223:25.05]Okay.
[223:27.35]Alright, do it.
[223:29.29]Do it!
[223:37.80]That's what the problem was.
[223:39.54]And in fact, it's still a problem.
[223:54.60]I feel like that takes too long.
[223:56.14]Oh, oh!
[224:31.56]Uh, you're still alive.
[224:32.38]You guys are persistent!
[224:36.39]What kind of pay you get?
[224:37.65]Asking for a friend!
[224:39.73]Fuck, guy's in the air.
[224:40.43]Alright, what do we got?
[224:42.11]Uh, let's get some drones.
[224:44.73]And let's weapon.
[224:47.82]And Jess, stop calling me!
[224:49.18]I did some research.
[224:50.52]All the people who are holding this is Protess and Sable's heavy-handed tactics.
[224:54.30]Gotcha.
[224:55.30]I'm launching the Protess myself right now.
[224:57.86]I'll let you know how it goes.
[225:01.83]It does need to go right now.
[225:13.97]Don't get me over there.
[225:33.29]Wave five.
[225:43.44]Got it.
[225:44.30]Get over there quick.
[225:49.33]He's still alive.
[225:50.39]Do it again.
[225:52.91]Into the wall.
[225:54.23]Got it.
[226:03.04]Explosion.
[226:10.87]At least Sable Base is definitely more going on here than the other ones.
[226:21.62]Ow.
[226:37.52]Furry mode?
[226:37.90]What the hell are you talking about?
[226:41.61]What is furry mode?
[226:45.89]I gotta fly up there.
[226:50.79]I'm not getting sniped by this guy.
[227:05.22]And you!
[227:07.46]Nope.
[227:07.92]He went behind a wall.
[227:10.96]He destroyed.
[227:15.80]Final wave.
[227:16.70]Alright.
[227:17.06]I didn't get it.
[227:18.12]Ah, I thought I got him.
[227:19.15]Stunned.
[227:19.67]Holy shit, look at all these people.
[227:40.97]Still alive.
[227:46.60]Good.
[227:47.56]Take care of that.
[227:55.22]Can't take the shield?
[227:56.30]Yes, I can.
[227:58.25]Oh, yes, I can.
[228:03.57]Wow!
[228:05.41]Not at the end like this, man.
[228:07.17]Guy up there with a fucking grenade launcher.
[228:34.84]Straight down... right over here.
[228:36.04]Where's he?
[228:38.16]I only have like two guys left.
[228:45.68]We're good.
[228:46.75]I had a lot of health.
[228:50.07]Alright!
[228:51.99]Where... are you?
[228:55.89]He's inside.
[228:56.93]Alright.
[228:59.97]I think both these guys are stuck inside.
[229:10.87]I did it.
[229:11.77]Did I do it?
[229:16.97]Where are you?
[229:22.56]He's dead.
[229:23.54]No, he's not.
[229:31.93]I will say, this is like the second or third time this has happened, and it is kind of annoying.
[229:36.65]Hold on.
[229:37.05]Is he outside?
[229:38.07]Oh, there we go.
[229:38.85]I knocked him out.
[229:49.51]Is it just like a... Is he out there?
[229:51.65]Can I make him come the other direction or something?
[229:55.21]No, he's just locked here.
[230:04.15]I'm gonna rock out on top of her.
[230:11.38]We are in such a bad place.
[230:12.92]Is he right there?
[230:13.50]What about if I do a drone or something?
[230:24.20]Let's rock out.
[230:26.79]I heard him.
[230:27.17]I have to walk.
[230:32.35]Got it.
[230:36.22]Did it.
[230:37.64]Release the prisoners.
[230:46.79]That was a long time.
[230:47.69]That was the longest base that I've had to do so far.
[230:52.44]Oh, one bug.
[230:52.82]Unplayable.
[230:53.16]One bug.
[231:09.41]Can I get that suit now?
[231:13.83]I can.
[231:14.31]Alright.
[231:15.19]Iron Man, Spider-Man suit.
[231:17.77]Whatever.
[231:18.15]You know what I'm saying.
[231:21.37]Wreck Havoc with four articulated arms.
[231:23.33]Let's see what it looks like.
[231:24.07]Let's see.
[231:30.22]Oh, that's awesome.
[231:35.28]Just turns you into the doppelganger.
[231:39.52]Yep.
[231:40.70]Okay.
[231:41.44]So what about these?
[231:42.67]No, I don't have enough to do any of these.
[231:44.07]I can do this one.
[231:50.71]Looks cool too.
[231:51.45]It's very shiny.
[232:06.34]There's the reservoir.
[232:07.16]See what's going on in the reservoir.
[232:09.18]Better take a closer look.
[232:10.24]Good transition.
[232:14.60]Now, if I was a mercenary dressed like a scorpion, where would I be?
[232:18.65]Behind you!
[232:24.17]Me?
[232:24.93]I'd end it now.
[232:26.39]But Octavius is paying, and he wants to torture you, which I respect.
[232:34.00]Damn it!
[232:34.76]What did he inject me with?
[232:38.86]Am I going to be in the dream world again?
[232:46.34]Oh, God.
[232:47.03]So it is poison.
[233:06.48]Remember how we said we couldn't die in lava?
[233:08.48]In water?
[233:11.30]This is gonna be a trip.
[233:13.44]Alright, get to higher ground.
[233:14.68]This is cool.
[233:16.50]Oh, this is awesome.
[233:17.56]No, no, no, no!
[233:18.92]Jump, jump, jump!
[233:20.39]I've tried.
[233:21.25]There's only a few places I can grab.
[233:45.97]This is so cool.
[233:51.34]Everything's underwater.
[233:55.12]Oh, I have to... Hardest boss fight so far.
[234:03.97]Some fragments contain subtractive lines.
[234:06.79]When a subtractive line overlaps an absorption line, they cancel out.
[234:12.24]Sure, okay, so we have this, and then we're gonna need this to cancel.
[234:18.59]No, you fucking idiot.
[234:21.53]This, and then cancel this, and then cancel this.
[234:34.28]Baby game puzzle.
[234:35.68]Hallucinogenic neurotoxin.
[234:38.08]My brain will create nightmares that my body thinks are real.
[234:43.45]I have to create the antidote fast.
[234:45.53]First, I need a natural steroid.
[234:47.95]Extract from an eclipta alba plant should do the trick.
[234:51.11]ASU's greenhouse is nearby.
[234:53.11]Hope it's in season.
[234:58.70]This is wild.
[235:01.82]Unfortunately, I really don't want to do the puzzle again.
[235:05.52]But, you know, that's just the way it is.
[235:10.19]jump out of the sand kind of should have known that oh that was like a universal ride they clipped alba it should be inside the greenhouse there it is water's getting higher
[235:40.78]Where'd it go?
[235:42.06]I stole it from me.
[235:46.92]Is this real or in my mind?
[235:49.28]It can be both.
[235:50.93]Doc?
[235:53.53]Now I'm getting spoken to by Doc Octopus.
[235:59.23]It's just the hallucinations intensifying.
[236:01.89]You can get through this.
[236:04.57]Doc?
[236:06.17]You sound...
[236:08.26]This is like Max Payne.
[236:12.12]My obsessions were always there.
[236:14.35]But the interface allowed me to fully embrace them.
[236:18.59]Or Half-Life.
[236:19.79]I have to fix this.
[236:21.83]Fix you.
[236:23.39]Somehow.
[236:25.93]Ah, Peter.
[236:27.79]Always trying to shoulder the responsibility.
[236:30.15]Yeah, you thought I was jumping off, didn't you?
[236:31.59]When there's no hope.
[236:34.07]I can't tell you how many times your unfettered optimism has kept me going when things look bleak.
[236:40.74]I'll miss being with you.
[236:42.88]I really will.
[236:43.70]I'm sorry.
[236:45.78]I'm so sorry.
[237:04.20]Fix you.
[237:05.78]Somehow.
[237:08.48]Ah, Peter.
[237:09.24]See, it was like it never happened.
[237:13.68]Even when there's no hope.
[237:16.65]I can't tell you how many times your unfettered optimism has kept me going when things look bleak.
[237:23.33]I'll miss being with you.
[237:25.45]I really will.
[237:27.07]I think I can make it.
[237:30.11]I'm sorry, Doc.
[237:31.51]I'm so sorry.
[237:34.44]Yes, yes, you're sorry.
[237:37.10]And yet, yes, you're so sorry, Peter.
[237:40.98]Makes one wonder where your priorities lie.
[237:43.61]I mean, if I was really that important to you, why would you let me destroy myself?
[237:50.97]What's with the hands?
[237:52.34]I can help you.
[237:53.98]It's the neural web.
[237:54.94]It's affecting your mind.
[237:56.86]There's the Ecliptolb.
[238:02.23]Alright, now I can make the serotoxin, whatever it's called.
[238:10.68]The neurotoxin.
[238:16.76]I can do something?
[238:18.42]Yeah.
[238:18.60]I need an antitoxin.
[238:20.68]Harry!
[238:30.56]Whoa.
[238:32.40]Deadly scorpion.
[238:33.97]Thanks, brain.
[238:39.92]Whoa!
[238:40.98]Alright, so I have to be aware of that.
[238:42.68]I'm stunned.
[238:43.38]How'd you get this number?
[238:45.10]Always asking these interesting questions.
[238:48.48]It's not, how am I calling you?
[238:50.98]It's, am I calling you?
[238:55.80]It's not, how am I calling you?
[238:58.82]It's, am I calling you?
[239:01.14]When I cure this poison, I'm coming for you, Mac.
[239:06.14]They need talk from the little bug.
[239:09.39]Have fun chasing Pink Elephant.
[239:16.29]He's cool.
[239:16.81]I like him.
[239:17.23]I was wondering if the poison was mine.
[239:24.78]Don't do it!
[239:25.64]Don't!
[239:26.46]Poison's bad.
[239:27.96]Kinda should've known that.
[239:29.86]There's the research station.
[239:32.20]Whoa!
[239:33.82]My toes!
[239:34.16]We need that atropine.
[239:39.08]Atropine's right there.
[239:43.70]Poison's bad.
[239:44.58]Poison is bad.
[239:47.10]Atropine's gone.
[239:49.72]Turn around, open the door.
[239:50.64]Another funhouse.
[239:52.82]Oh, not again.
[240:00.07]More of this.
[240:00.63]Oh, it's my fault now?
[240:26.10]I'm sorry I'll find a way to help you I swear it this is really interesting looking architecture you never help anyone the poison isn't it you are the poison everyone you touch suffers
[240:44.23]Stop running from me.
[240:45.55]Let me try.
[240:46.27]I just don't get to relax, man.
[240:48.63]I'm just a problem.
[240:50.03]Everybody hates me.
[240:52.45]You're a failure at life, love, career.
[240:56.81]This is kind of freaking me out.
[240:57.69]You bring nothing but pain.
[241:00.66]Wah.
[241:01.66]No, stop.
[241:03.12]I'm not giving up on you.
[241:06.28]That's crazy.
[241:08.70]Is that gonna come down and try to kill me?
[241:12.08]I'm just crawling.
[241:12.63]I wanna just look at this.
[241:14.71]That's so odd.
[241:31.85]I don't wanna pick that up yet, hold on.
[241:36.19]That's wild.
[241:37.61]That'll come from over there, that's cool.
[242:11.29]Take a selfie.
[242:13.33]I can't take a selfie.
[242:14.11]It's not real.
[242:17.37]It'll end up being with red eyes in my bathroom.
[242:21.01]Now I just need to mix up the antidote.
[242:24.56]Just wait and I can prove it!
[242:25.78]I can prove that this happened!
[242:27.44]Take a look at my digital camera!
[242:28.86]Look at all these fucking photos!
[242:31.02]There's a green shit face in front of my fridge.
[242:33.22]In front of my bathroom.
[242:34.90]Me lying in my bed smiling.
[242:45.41]Two of them now.
[242:46.01]Three of them.
[242:46.65]Whoa!
[242:48.07]Whoa!
[242:48.89]That's a lot of poison.
[242:49.79]That's poison.
[242:51.19]That's a lot of poison.
[242:52.75]Get up higher.
[243:00.73]Oh man.
[243:12.10]No poison, no poison, no poison.
[243:16.84]Jesus Christ.
[243:19.91]Oh!
[243:25.67]Where where is it somehow go in the door I need to mix the antidote The power of the ps4 I'm a slip down one of those tendrils to I
[243:54.67]Use webs and gadgets to stun Scorpion.
[244:22.91]This is the scarecrow level in Arkham.
[244:31.02]Electricity seems to work real well.
[244:35.20]I went a little too far, but I got it.
[244:38.01]Skipped.
[244:41.08]I don't know what this is.
[244:41.76]It's going to be a bunch of hallucinations.
[244:43.74]It's going to be like five of them.
[244:44.76]I knew it.
[244:45.13]Whoa!
[244:45.33]I don't have any more of those.
[245:21.67]Move away, impact way ahead.
[245:23.57]How many more are left here?
[245:34.44]End it, end it, end it!
[245:52.12]Where are you?
[245:52.72]There he is.
[245:53.30]Interesting.
[245:54.32]And then it's the real fight against Scorpion.
[245:57.86]And not time.
[246:22.23]Okay, I thought that was gonna turn into a monster and I had to fight the guest.
[246:24.59]I told you.
[246:25.95]See?
[246:26.03]Look, pizza box.
[246:27.59]Yeah, exactly.
[246:30.71]You got takeout box, pizza box.
[246:51.80]Whatever that is, he's like huffing helium in here.
[246:55.24]He's playing with his little fake water gun.
[246:59.97]Yeah, that's what happened.
[247:00.91]That's actually what happened.
[247:03.45]Fisk, Crusader, or Criminal?
[247:06.37]Criminal.
[247:12.27]Will Scorpion sting or sing?
[247:13.99]Electro unplugged.
[247:14.97]Rhino's rampage.
[247:16.71]Vulture squawks.
[247:18.95]Yep.
[247:21.68]Okay, let's get out of here.
[247:25.53]I wish this was another hallucination.
[247:29.89]Open the door and it happens again.
[247:36.58]Do I get the underwear outfit?
[247:42.13]Ah.
[247:43.32]Do I get the underwear outfit now?
[247:44.96]Hold on.
[247:45.90]Yep.
[247:45.98]Nope.
[247:46.12]I will.
[247:46.36]Alright, I've got this maxed out, this maxed out.
[248:10.61]Draw and shot, steal more damage.
[248:11.63]I need a backpack token and a challenge token.
[248:15.06]Backpack, challenge.
[248:18.32]Crime.
[248:18.80]Okay, I don't even have that made.
[248:24.46]Backpack and landmark, I could do.
[248:25.82]Increase maximum shots of this gadget.
[248:27.99]Suspension, make... Yeah, just get him.
[248:29.49]Okay, I need backpack and challenge token.
[248:37.01]But first of all, I'm gonna... I'm gonna pee.
[248:40.57]I'm going to take a little break.
[248:41.36]I'll be right back, and we'll continue.
[248:44.21]I'll be right back.
[252:47.47]Alright.
[252:49.35]So, question for those of you that have finished this game, just out of curiosity.
[252:52.49]Hold on, let me close this window.
[252:56.23]What, uh, how much, how many, let's say I did a little bit, a couple more side missions, and then did the rest of the story missions, right?
[253:06.22]How many hours do you think are left in the game?
[253:10.11]What would you say?
[253:19.77]Two, three.
[253:22.21]Two or three.
[253:27.10]Four.
[253:30.56]I don't know.
[253:31.30]But at least that person's really honest.
[253:36.37]Four hours.
[253:38.19]Two, alright.
[253:39.25]So we'll just do it tonight.
[253:44.41]Still early enough.
[253:45.09]This is why I started early these last couple of days, obviously.
[253:48.03]So we're just going to complete Spider-Man tonight.
[253:51.86]Might be a seven or eight hour stream.
[253:53.38]It's only 9.30.
[253:57.74]We'll reassess.
[253:59.44]If it really is only going to be like another two or three hours, then why would I... Hey, let's stop it in like half an hour and then I'll stream for an hour and a half tomorrow.
[254:08.01]No, let's just do it all tonight.
[254:12.95]Good thing I started early.
[254:14.81]by a couple hours alright let's uh let's go bring it back over here let's just keep going so uh we have some new skills surprise attack yank and throw that's really no I wanted to do this one because I want to go down here that's really really effective slowest time before you take a fatal hit take it
[254:43.29]Can only be used once per combat encounter.
[254:45.93]Still good, though.
[254:46.75]Especially during a hard boss fight, potentially.
[254:48.87]Okay, after a perfect dodge... If you dodge a rifle or a gun... That's great, too.
[254:58.85]I'm just going to go down here.
[255:00.11]This is what we're doing.
[255:01.73]Until I get it all.
[255:05.37]Okay.
[255:07.69]We just have to do Spider-Man tasks.
[255:11.01]I found one.
[255:13.62]Okay, hold on.
[255:16.85]Okay.
[255:17.17]Took a second.
[255:20.55]Get that guy out of there.
[255:42.24]I'll drive her out of the car and... Out of the car over there.
[255:46.36]Or did I get it?
[255:46.90]Did I...?
[256:15.18]Who's left?
[256:16.90]You?
[256:17.00]Complete crime within two minutes.
[256:18.16]Stop crime without taking damage.
[256:21.18]Use the spider arms.
[256:25.96]Enough of those just random chumps.
[256:30.04]Best to be... I'm going to be surrounded by enemies.
[256:35.41]There's a base over here.
[256:36.53]There is what I'm looking for.
[256:38.17]No, what is this?
[256:42.33]What is this one?
[256:44.36]There's so many different things, I don't even know what the hell they are anymore.
[256:46.83]It's a prisoner camp.
[256:48.49]Perform 15 perfect dodges.
[256:50.15]Perform 15 finishers.
[256:53.81]Uh, okay.
[256:54.59]I think I need... No, I can't change the power.
[256:56.85]Quietly might be pushing it, but I can do it without a massive shootout.
[257:00.62]There might be a bunch of webs around, though.
[257:14.27]Alright, I'll be quiet.
[257:19.43]We got this guy over there.
[257:24.49]So, it really is so much more effective just to do the stealth.
[257:27.83]Kill them in one hit.
[257:28.69]Guy down there.
[257:33.36]I was gonna throw a motorcycle, but that's not stealthy.
[257:43.06]That's loud.
[257:55.89]Okay.
[258:01.89]Two guys.
[258:06.86]One is this way.
[258:07.64]I think I can get the guy.
[258:12.25]Oh, let's go.
[258:25.40]I didn't see it.
[258:26.19]I'm not spotted yet.
[258:26.87]I have no idea what's going on.
[258:34.47]So what was the mission here?
[258:35.99]15 perfect dodges.
[258:47.68]Well, that... Okay, that's fine.
[258:56.02]Okay, well that's wave two.
[259:00.73]I guess we just have to fight that.
[259:02.63]And yes, guys, here it comes.
[259:04.29]I'll do it.
[259:04.75]Three, two, one.
[259:10.25]Wow, that's actually pretty awesome.
[259:16.76]The spread is so large.
[259:26.02]Lasts a long time too.
[259:52.93]Can I get a... Never mind.
[259:55.39]I just started speaking and I lost my combo.
[259:59.16]Well, that's what I get.
[260:00.18]Let's do some perfect dodge.
[260:03.90]Who else?
[260:07.70]I can't breathe.
[260:17.57]Damn it, really?
[260:27.61]Like, when I'm focusing on it, it's, like, harder to do.
[260:31.65]It's much easier just to be fighting, flying around, and... Whoa!
[260:34.39]Button!
[261:02.03]I'm trying to just build so I can do the finishes.
[261:07.02]I gotta take out the idiot who's doing this.
[261:18.42]Who else?
[261:22.87]No!
[261:30.10]No, that's an explosion.
[261:31.14]Alright, I'll get it.
[261:32.20]Not that much.
[261:32.74]As long as I can do more.
[262:01.67]Really could use that end of the tree here.
[262:03.21]I don't even think about it.
[262:04.71]Oh no, big guy.
[262:30.93]Holy fuck.
[262:36.03]No, you don't.
[262:43.74]Finally.
[262:46.08]Fuck.
[263:10.56]Oh, let's get some people in here.
[263:14.34]Who's so... Oh my god!
[263:19.54]Do it!
[263:46.83]I think there's not enough people to do finishes.
[263:50.50]Yeah, there's not enough people.
[263:59.76]Oh well.
[264:06.28]God damn it.
[264:09.40]Awww.
[264:11.93]That's so sad.
[264:20.17]Why can't I do it to this guy?
[264:32.18]I'm sad.
[264:32.72]I'm actually upset.
[264:44.57]The dudes are two bars.
[264:46.17]Yeah, it would have been, what, 13 or 14?
[264:47.55]Damn it.
[264:48.03]Oh well.
[264:48.31]It's okay.
[264:48.53]Alright.
[264:48.85]Let me get the tower.
[264:49.43]I think that should be... Is that enough?
[265:16.16]New suit.
[265:19.21]Velocity suit.
[265:21.69]Micro... Micro gyros allow for faster sprinting and real-time momentum transfer knocks down enemies.
[265:34.32]That's pretty cool.
[265:38.84]Challenge tokens and backpack tokens.
[265:46.00]Get that right now.
[265:48.45]And now I can run.
[265:49.61]I don't have to fly.
[265:53.43]I don't have it yet.
[265:54.51]Wait, wait, wait.
[265:55.15]Gadgets, gadgets.
[265:57.87]I did that for a specific reason.
[265:59.07]What needed this?
[266:01.21]No.
[266:02.67]No.
[266:04.08]No.
[266:05.32]No.
[266:07.46]No.
[266:08.80]No.
[266:09.14]It didn't need anything.
[266:11.50]Great work, Jeremy.
[266:15.80]Is he allergic to the 2099 suit?
[266:17.92]No, I thought I was... That's just the easy one to pick.
[266:24.36]I want to do the other ones.
[266:29.69]Blitz is a really cool perk.
[266:32.53]Well, I still haven't... I want to play with this suit for a little while.
[266:36.21]Just a little while.
[266:39.79]MJ, hey, you mind if I toss a kind of thorny ethical question at you?
[266:43.71]You always fall at the worst times.
[266:44.93]When is it okay to give up on a friend?
[266:47.69]Oh, wow, Pete.
[266:49.37]Thinking of Otto?
[266:50.05]What was that noise?
[266:50.79]Not obvious, huh?
[266:54.12]Is the t-rex attacking New York?
[266:59.38]Being a true friend means being there, even when people lose their way.
[267:03.07]But with what Otto's done?
[267:05.59]I just don't know, Pete.
[267:07.03]I guess you have to decide if the Otto Octavius you knew is still in there or not.
[267:12.11]Maybe if he was ever even in there at all.
[267:14.79]Yeah.
[267:18.25]Yeah.
[267:18.63]I gotta process some stuff, I think.
[267:22.30]This is driving in a circle.
[267:23.86]Oh my god.
[267:28.50]Alright, this is not even the right thing.
[267:31.10]Where's the antenna?
[267:38.65]This is the antenna.
[267:42.19]Hello?
[267:43.99]Is this... Not the antenna.
[267:49.31]It's been this every time, hasn't it?
[267:57.29]Oh.
[268:07.51]Okay.
[268:08.27]I guess I will come back.
[268:44.07]Stop the truck.
[268:45.75]Very nice.
[268:56.71]Alright.
[268:57.00]Stop.
[268:57.26]Make it so it doesn't.
[268:58.60]Stop it so it stops.
[268:59.38]I'm psyched.
[269:00.26]I'm getting closer.
[269:02.28]What?
[269:02.54]What?
[269:09.27]The bomb in mid-air.
[269:09.99]Oh, the bomb!
[269:10.33]This bomb!
[269:10.63]That was a lot of time.
[269:11.36]Okay, now can I do it?
[269:39.47]It was the car.
[269:40.53]It was the car chase going around in a circle that fucked this whole thing up.
[269:47.08]Ah, it's right there.
[269:52.62]I'll do it.
[269:53.00]And I'll get the backpack too.
[269:58.30]We'll go to the cat and the backpack.
[270:01.69]What's closer?
[270:02.31]It doesn't matter.
[270:14.50]What's that?
[270:15.68]Yuri's contact info.
[270:16.22]Whatever.
[270:16.40]Someone's going to be really mad about that.
[270:31.03]Where is it?
[271:10.24]I was just standing over there.
[271:11.40]I'm standing next to her.
[271:12.26]I'm blind.
[271:13.20]I didn't even... I turned over here.
[271:15.49]It wasn't this way.
[271:16.07]What are you jokers... jokers... jokers on about here?
[271:41.25]Bunch of fucking jokers.
[271:42.51]Through here.
[272:11.42]Such a good shot.
[272:13.46]I'm going 500 miles per hour right now.
[272:16.26]Huh?
[272:16.56]Where did you shoot that from?
[272:20.02]Talk about... Bullshit.
[272:39.39]Right over here.
[272:40.03]Until Miles gets back, the best thing we can do is keep everyone fed.
[272:45.21]Oh, Peter.
[272:46.39]It is so good to see you.
[272:47.51]Oh, Peter.
[272:48.35]How are you?
[272:49.01]Healthy?
[272:49.93]I'm good.
[272:50.37]How are you holding up, May?
[272:52.29]Good, but busy.
[272:54.35]Oh, let me help.
[272:57.79]Oh, there.
[273:01.53]She's very clearly infected.
[273:02.97]I'm okay.
[273:06.03]Didn't you tell me something once about accepting that I'm human just like everyone else?
[273:11.17]You and Beth.
[273:13.84]Masters at turning my own words against me.
[273:17.50]I am fine, Peter.
[273:19.72]Just a little rundown.
[273:22.18]Where's Miles?
[273:23.08]Could he help out?
[273:23.92]Oh, he is.
[273:24.66]He's off picking up medical supplies from the relief center.
[273:29.22]It's amazing how quickly we go through antibiotics.
[273:32.89]Okay, you stay off your feet for a bit.
[273:35.56]I'll organize the unloading and check in with Miles.
[273:38.08]Deal?
[273:38.90]Deal.
[273:40.60]Give me a chance to nurse my wounded Parker pride.
[273:48.92]Come on, Miles, answer.
[273:51.42]Don't make me worry about you and May.
[273:53.39]Miles, stealth mission incoming in five, four, three, two, one.
[274:05.79]Quiet?
[274:07.98]So much for a no-go.
[274:09.12]I need a bunch of convicts to do this.
[274:12.38]Looks like an exploding bulldozer went through here.
[274:16.24]I can't turn back.
[274:17.04]Beast needs those antibiotics.
[274:19.94]Way too many bad dudes that way.
[274:21.24]Hey, who's there?
[274:37.60]Whoa!
[274:38.22]God damn it!
[274:45.31]I had it.
[274:45.91]It was so close.
[274:54.23]Better hurry.
[274:56.39]I like it way better on this side of the forest.
[275:03.06]I should be able to hop that wall.
[275:06.53]I don't want to do it.
[275:08.69]I don't want to do it.
[275:10.91]Stepping on every piece of broken fucking glass.
[275:17.37]I don't want to do it.
[275:35.32]How many people get infected by that?
[275:36.62]Just you?
[275:37.16]Listen to your funny radio.
[275:46.21]There's glass everywhere.
[275:47.23]God damn it.
[275:48.11]Again with the fucking glass.
[275:51.49]Hold on.
[275:51.83]Slow down.
[275:52.55]I think I can make it through this.
[275:53.63]Oh, shit.
[276:00.22]I don't think I should go this way.
[276:06.74]No, I gotta go this way.
[276:07.68]I gotta go around.
[276:08.26]It's very clear.
[276:08.82]I probably need to go up and around that guy.
[276:10.58]Yeah.
[276:10.90]Go over there.
[276:23.88]Sable guys give up the depot locations?
[276:26.56]Eventually, yeah.
[276:27.87]Now the big guy's taking the stations out all by himself.
[276:30.37]Dude's been walking eight miles.
[276:32.23]What's that?
[276:32.71]That Russian mug, man.
[276:33.99]Makes you crazy.
[276:36.04]That's offensive.
[276:37.02]My grandma's Russian.
[276:38.46]Your grandma?
[276:40.76]What the fuck is that conversation?
[276:45.40]What is that conversation?
[276:51.85]I just did the wrong thing.
[276:55.59]Oh, where do I go from here?
[276:58.47]Okay, they're all distracted.
[277:00.91]That was such a fake.
[277:03.03]Let me just tell you something, my grandma's Russian.
[277:31.68]Gotta avoid that sniper.
[277:46.10]That guy could have probably, like, breathed.
[277:48.39]No, I mean, like, smelled.
[277:52.33]That guy probably could have smelt, like, the... my... What was his jacket made out of?
[277:57.07]Fleece?
[277:57.91]He could have probably smelt the fleece.
[278:00.15]That's how close he was.
[278:04.77]All that for nothing.
[278:18.35]Do I have to kill Rhino as Miles?
[278:25.50]No!
[278:27.16]I won't tell.
[278:31.14]I apologize.
[278:33.97]My associate is inelegant.
[278:40.75]He doesn't understand the fine art of persuasion.
[278:45.72]Who's the green guy?
[278:49.63]The green guy?
[278:51.61]Oh, the bad guy green guy.
[279:08.45]I don't know.
[279:09.45]I actually don't know.
[279:10.18]The Sting or something, I think his name is.
[279:14.02]More boxes to run into, by the way, everybody!
[279:39.49]I'm gonna hide from... I'm just playing Outlast.
[279:44.45]Yeah, the Stinger and... Charge Man.
[280:08.38]The stinger and the horn.
[280:09.26]Alright, I get it.
[280:10.68]Alright, let's go.
[280:12.14]He's making a lot of box noise here.
[280:51.12]Wait, wait, wait.
[280:52.00]What if he's right here?
[280:52.87]What if he's right here?
[280:54.29]What if he's... Use cover objects to sneak by Rhino.
[281:05.87]Am I hacking something first?
[281:11.79]Oh, he's gonna come break this one now.
[281:19.12]He's gonna break this one.
[281:23.87]Fucking box!
[281:25.69]Fucking box!
[281:26.73]God, no!
[281:32.91]Oh, God!
[281:36.71]At least it's right here.
[281:38.13]Play no games with me.
[281:40.98]The only way forward is right past the ground.
[281:44.78]He didn't see her.
[281:45.34]Be patient.
[281:50.20]We got together, Doctor.
[282:06.81]I didn't hit the box, right?
[282:16.31]Good.
[282:21.07]Wait, wait.
[282:25.58]Jump over this?
[282:27.18]No.
[282:28.92]I don't know.
[282:29.32]I'm gonna have to watch this for a second, okay?
[282:31.84]This is okay.
[282:41.79]What the fuck?
[282:46.13]Where's the exit, though?
[282:54.82]Where's the exit?
[282:55.38]Gotta get up there.
[282:57.86]Yeah, there, that container.
[283:00.46]Does this look like I can hack?
[283:25.04]Watch out for the fucking trash.
[283:31.21]Good work.
[283:40.25]Oh my god, he can see through here.
[283:42.57]Oh my god, how did I not get spotted?
[283:48.49]I have no idea.
[284:00.99]You made it.
[284:05.06]You should let me know I have these.
[284:08.26]Get off me!
[284:30.23]Just give us the wallet!
[284:31.63]Give it to us, man!
[284:33.87]Help!
[284:37.83]Hey, leave him alone!
[284:45.21]Big mistake, kid.
[284:51.24]You can't just push people around like that.
[284:55.21]Spider-man taught you how to do really good things you want to taste Now I'm good kid
[285:27.26]I love the guy that just gets...
[285:55.34]The hardened, scary criminal that's probably been in hundreds of fights just gets punched in the face one time and he's instantly dead.
[286:08.95]Incredible work, Miles.
[286:10.23]Stick close to Feast.
[286:10.91]I think he's never been punched before.
[286:11.87]If the convicts get desperate, they may try to raid the shelter.
[286:13.91]It's not happening.
[286:14.77]It's never happened to him.
[286:15.93]Anything else happens here, I'll let you know.
[286:18.43]Great.
[286:19.21]Thanks, Miles.
[286:22.35]Yeah, that guy, you're right.
[286:24.05]That guy probably has a couple of murders on his rap sheet.
[286:27.16]Feed free.
[286:27.66]Up the wall.
[286:57.03]This is far away.
[287:01.13]So, I have not used fast travel one time.
[287:05.77]I'm just picking up on that right now.
[287:07.84]The only time I used it was when the game made me do it.
[287:10.50]Hey MJ, what's up?
[287:12.58]You okay?
[287:14.32]I'm actually surprised a game like this, whose pretty much number one selling point is flying around, swinging around New York, added fast travel.
[287:24.16]You know what I'm saying?
[287:25.28]This is some of the most fun you can have in the whole game, is what I'm doing right now.
[287:39.02]How much simpler things were back then?
[287:41.40]No jobs, no supervillains.
[287:44.37]We could throw away a whole day looking for bad pizza just cause.
[287:47.93]You know, it feels like we're taking a nap.
[287:50.55]The world is all hard.
[287:52.11]Yeah, this adult thing is rough.
[287:55.11]But I guess the work we do means today's kids can have their own Staten Island adventures.
[287:59.95]And safety.
[288:01.42]Kind of a circle of life thing.
[288:03.68]Circle of bad pizza.
[288:06.37]Yeah, you're right.
[288:07.71]That's a good way to look at it.
[288:09.19]Had to do the front flip there.
[288:10.13]Speaking of front flips.
[288:15.73]Had to do that too.
[288:16.75]No!
[288:19.73]It feels so bad doing that.
[288:25.05]Stable.
[288:26.53]Stable lookout.
[288:27.13]I need some backpacks.
[288:28.43]And I can take this boat right here.
[288:31.17]Get a good spot.
[288:36.01]Got it.
[288:36.67]That's your history museum.
[288:41.10]Let's get the backpack, too.
[288:41.82]Backpack.
[288:43.14]I'm gonna re-pick that.
[288:51.74]Right in the bottom there.
[288:54.92]Cool.
[289:07.06]Skills.
[289:08.14]Two points.
[289:09.24]I told myself I was going to go right down the middle.
[289:10.94]I need three.
[289:11.60]That's incredibly useful.
[289:18.35]I'm right here, right?
[289:21.83]Standing on top of it.
[289:23.17]Let's do it.
[289:26.33]Stealth challenge.
[289:27.55]Here's one of them.
[289:28.49]See you in two hours.
[289:29.67]Forgot Taskmaster was a person.
[289:56.62]Yeah.
[289:58.48]So this is in place of the Brither mission, right?
[290:01.62]Oh, Jesus.
[290:05.28]Take out everybody.
[290:06.02]Guy up top there.
[290:08.52]Can I distract you first?
[290:17.16]Ha, put up your hands!
[290:19.41]Ah, no!
[290:21.29]Spider-Man's here!
[290:30.91]You're under arrest, Spider-Man.
[290:32.39]Mmm, well.
[290:39.79]I wonder if I can get these done.
[290:42.33]Quickly, one, two.
[290:46.72]No, I'm behind the goddamn box.
[290:54.56]Rock out.
[290:57.40]Maybe I'll just go around.
[291:03.53]Gotta move quick and quiet.
[291:04.59]At least I have to get both these guys.
[291:08.41]One and then two.
[291:09.51]I mean, I guess I could do... Let me try this.
[291:22.42]Good night, goo.
[291:32.48]Okay.
[291:33.94]I'm trying to hit them both at the same time.
[291:41.83]Will this work?
[291:42.37]I wonder.
[291:42.73]Yep, okay.
[291:58.75]Impact web hits other people.
[291:59.95]Alright, so now we need... I've got nine enemies left.
[292:03.92]Although they are scant... There's two over there.
[292:05.66]Let me just get back this way.
[292:14.80]Somebody else on this roof.
[292:16.85]Where the hell is he, though?
[292:17.65]Is he here alone?
[292:22.93]Where the hell are they?
[292:23.73]There he is.
[292:29.50]That dude over there.
[292:30.35]Watch out for that.
[292:31.83]Nobody else up here but this guy.
[292:34.75]That scan right there.
[292:36.63]I'm not okay with that.
[292:38.95]I'm not okay with that.
[292:39.99]Wait until it passes.
[292:42.46]What do I have?
[292:42.82]Two minutes?
[292:46.30]When it goes across again.
[292:47.20]I got plenty of time.
[292:50.14]They're so cute when they're sleeping.
[293:00.93]across the way.
[293:02.05]Down there?
[293:02.47]I gotta get the other side.
[293:05.13]I'm kind of running out of time now.
[293:16.04]Is that looking for me?
[293:20.38]Guy up there.
[293:21.10]Guy up there.
[293:21.84]Let's go this way.
[293:23.92]Okay, here we go.
[293:28.88]Nighty night.
[293:31.50]What?
[293:32.78]Wow!
[293:36.88]Come on, really?
[293:37.90]Apparently it wasn't, I gotta do that, I gotta speed this up, man.
[293:48.61]Gotta move quick and quiet.
[294:03.81]Didn't have a chance to talk.
[294:04.73]Fuck off.
[294:05.29]No, I'm gonna run into an impact web, though.
[294:11.51]I don't want that to happen.
[294:18.15]This guy over there.
[294:25.64]That's it.
[294:26.24]Wait for the... It's already passing.
[294:28.80]Let's go back up.
[294:33.66]Okay, now... Same thing.
[294:37.66]Do it again.
[294:47.34]This time... How many... I got two impact webs.
[294:49.80]I'm gonna get that guy right there.
[294:51.84]Does anybody see that shit?
[294:54.32]If I go to this building right here, that guy's scanning.
[294:57.05]We'll wait till he goes the other side.
[294:58.11]I'm gonna impact web, impact web.
[295:01.72]How many turns?
[295:02.26]Okay, here we go.
[295:04.18]Okay, that's good.
[295:11.89]Alright.
[295:13.05]Let's get the guys on the ground.
[295:16.95]One, two, three.
[295:24.62]Okay.
[295:28.24]Who's down here?
[295:30.43]That guy right there.
[295:33.51]Safe.
[295:40.19]That guy's safe as well.
[295:41.47]I'm out of web.
[295:41.99]What do we got?
[295:45.73]Three enemies left?
[295:46.43]Where are the other guys?
[295:48.63]Okay, down there.
[295:51.89]Can I pull this guy?
[295:52.61]What do I got?
[295:53.09]A minute?
[295:57.14]Creep it off.
[296:01.20]Alright, I'm alright with two.
[296:08.28]I'm okay with two.
[296:10.74]I'm impressed.
[296:12.58]Not yet.
[296:12.84]I have so much more to learn.
[296:13.62]I'm okay with two tokens.
[296:31.09]Don't need more than that.
[296:35.51]The Taskmaster.
[296:36.63]Alright, backpack.
[296:41.85]Then let me see if I can upgrade.
[296:43.80]Down there, straight down.
[296:47.46]Keychain.
[296:48.16]Every day in every way, I'm getting better and better.
[297:01.73]Two stars and three stars both give three tokens.
[297:06.27]That's good to know.
[297:11.76]Got a crime right here.
[297:15.54]These are actually pretty easy.
[297:16.66]Sleep crime within two minutes.
[297:17.62]I would say that's within two minutes.
[297:32.50]In fact, that was, you know, 10 seconds.
[297:36.89]Oh, there's another course of shooting.
[298:03.07]Oh, it's over.
[298:03.83]No, it's not.
[298:04.37]Not quite.
[298:09.70]Alright, I got this.
[298:17.24]Free token.
[298:21.75]Now, on to the real mission.
[298:23.43]I'm just going to leapfrog there.
[298:41.33]All units advised, prisoners are stealing vehicles and driving around the city.
[298:44.90]Do not, it's not fast enough, I gotta go fast enough.
[298:47.76]Alarmus, apparently, this is... Leapfrog only.
[298:51.72]No, I can't.
[298:53.10]All nasty words people have used to insult and demean me.
[298:57.41]But now, after years of me trying to warn you all,
[299:02.89]Spider-man on a plague.
[299:05.01]I think we're gonna get a number, a number, or a double.
[299:08.29]A double boss fight.
[299:30.34]Juggernaut is, Juggernaut is, Juggernaut is, Juggernaut is.
[299:32.93]Defeat Rhino.
[299:33.55]Oh, I have to throw shit at him.
[299:59.01]Ah, wait a minute.
[300:01.09]Hold on a second.
[300:02.03]Come over here.
[300:04.61]Come stand this way.
[300:05.87]I bet you you won't have this drop on you.
[300:08.48]And rinse and repeat.
[300:18.56]Come over here.
[300:24.86]Charge!
[300:28.97]Oh, it didn't get him.
[300:31.82]It didn't get him.
[300:32.76]It didn't get him.
[300:36.06]Come here.
[300:43.72]Stand right here.
[300:44.55]Look how healthy.
[300:49.63]Wait, he actually is just standing right there.
[300:52.79]He was just standing there.
[300:54.61]He was kind of standing there, wasn't he?
[300:57.72]He needs to be facing this way.
[301:04.96]I just gotta let that happen.
[301:14.08]Just fucking drop it on his head already.
[301:18.46]Well, we're gonna go to a different one.
[301:19.76]Because, like, he's for some reason...
[301:38.05]I believe it was my current dog.
[301:39.09]Let's go.
[301:41.01]Let's try this again.
[301:42.31]Drag it down.
[302:10.71]Okay, Rhino, let's wrap this up
[302:41.12]Here we go again.
[302:42.74]I gotta get with some high ground or something, man.
[302:45.76]Because, like, jeez.
[302:47.54]Alright.
[302:47.80]Oof.
[303:13.86]I think maybe I could get them to run into each other?
[303:19.10]How did you beat Bebop and Rocksteady in Turtles in Time?
[303:21.36]You had to get Bebop and Rocksteady to run into each other.
[303:25.77]Into the poison?
[303:28.07]Not quite.
[303:43.17]Maybe I should web.
[303:46.27]He'll run into me or something.
[303:48.03]I'm assuming.
[303:51.35]I feel like he should run into me.
[303:53.63]Yeah, like that.
[303:56.09]See?
[303:56.39]I gotta make him ram into his buddy.
[304:12.89]Where is he?
[304:14.65]He's perched up somewhere.
[304:18.40]On the ground.
[304:19.80]Here I come.
[304:25.01]Ready?
[304:31.94]Oh, that didn't do anything.
[304:33.48]Never mind.
[304:33.88]I'd rip Fireman's face off for free.
[304:56.91]Charge into him.
[304:58.31]Bang.
[304:58.75]Double team.
[304:59.63]Ugh.
[305:00.85]That's just... I don't think I'm... That's not happening.
[305:03.11]Alright.
[305:07.89]Let's try to get another hit on Vino here.
[305:12.26]Ow.
[305:12.42]Ow, much?
[305:24.23]Carge over here.
[305:24.69]I think they can hit each other.
[305:26.81]Let's do it.
[305:27.41]I don't think this is a good idea.
[305:28.75]Carge over here.
[305:31.33]Come on, I need you to go right here.
[305:53.67]He's on the ground.
[305:55.61]I don't even know what happened there.
[306:00.36]Oh, shit.
[306:01.68]He's down.
[306:02.26]He's not gonna count.
[306:21.73]Alright, just need to bring him to another thing to drag down.
[306:24.27]This thing right here.
[306:26.24]We could just stop now, you know.
[306:28.00]I won't tell anybody.
[306:29.22]Oh, I didn't get it.
[306:33.54]Maybe another one like right here.
[306:39.97]Let's go.
[306:43.99]Come here, pouch.
[306:45.05]I will keep you.
[306:47.59]Throw a real punch.
[306:49.80]I think that's end of phase one.
[306:51.48]I kind of feel bad for Rhino.
[306:55.74]In fight!
[306:57.28]In fight!
[307:26.22]A little sports together time might help you boys learn to play nice.
[307:35.40]Dude, you gotta wrap some duct tape around that thing, man.
[307:37.62]It's not secure.
[307:39.34]Something tells me they won't be as easy.
[307:41.28]They're only half our problem, though.
[307:43.32]Devil's Breath cases are getting worse, and Oscorp is being coy about an anti-serum.
[307:47.61]I'm worried they're seeing dollar signs in a seller's market.
[307:50.59]I'd expect nothing less from our beloved mayor.
[307:53.35]Leave Devil's Breath to me.
[307:54.65]One of my best people is on it.
[307:59.07]Hey, I've been through the city state and federal databases if this devil's breath lab does exist It's off the books.
[308:05.87]The only other place I can think to look is in Norman's personal files I've already been through his office computer.
[308:12.64]Are you thinking his penthouse?
[308:14.68]That buildings full of sables men if they spot me other residents could get hurt in a firefight.
[308:19.12]I
[308:19.86]I know, but I might be able to get in undetected.
[308:23.36]I can sneak in, find the lab's location, and get out.
[308:26.72]If anything goes wrong, I'll call you for backup.
[308:29.60]Okay.
[308:30.62]It's risky, but we need that location.
[308:33.06]Wait for me to get nearby, then make your move.
[308:35.80]I'll be ready.
[308:36.30]Alright.
[308:42.00]Let's go to Norman Osborn.
[308:46.44]How much longer am I going to be streaming for?
[308:47.95]Until the game is complete.
[308:51.71]We're at that point where... Turning on a stream in the next day or two to finish Spider-Man.
[308:59.47]It would be, okay, I'm alive for two hours.
[309:02.06]That's it.
[309:03.80]What do we do now?
[309:05.30]God damn it, every time.
[309:10.70]They won't let me in my building.
[309:14.20]Said it's quarantine.
[309:15.47]I said, fine, let me in and I'll stay there.
[309:17.31]They pointed their guns at me.
[309:18.83]Ran me off like a criminal.
[309:20.31]I got no place to go.
[309:21.89]What's the version of the game?
[309:23.97]I promise you, I'll bring it to the attention of the proper audience.
[309:30.65]I would say this is a solid... If it was out of a 100-point scale, I would say this is a very, very solid 68th.
[309:43.50]I'm kidding.
[309:44.92]I gotta correct that immediately because people are gonna be like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[309:51.88]Out of 100 points, I'd give this like 94.
[309:52.94]Maybe 92.
[309:54.86]Let's be real. 92.
[309:58.38]Okay, MJ.
[309:59.00]I'm a couple blocks away.
[310:00.74]Let me know if you get into trouble.
[310:06.51]And if this is a MJ sneak around mission, it's a 90.
[310:14.39]Thanks, Beat.
[310:15.25]Wish me luck.
[310:17.27]Okay.
[310:18.41]Norman's penthouse is on the top floor, but the elevator's on lockdown.
[310:23.21]Need to get into the security room to unlock it.
[310:26.26]By the way, from here on out, every future stealth mission in the rest of the game drops the score by two points.
[310:35.68]Great.
[310:36.40]Harsh, but fair.
[310:37.72]Okay.
[310:56.86]He'll never survive this.
[310:58.66]Next election, he'll get destroyed.
[311:04.50]There's the security room.
[311:06.10]I mean, the only good stealth mission was the Rhino mission.
[311:08.31]I would agree.
[311:08.89]Residents are pretty upset.
[311:10.61]It was actually really interesting stuff going on.
[311:12.33]Maybe I can rile them up to create a distraction.
[311:16.13]Alright.
[311:17.01]Create a diversion.
[311:20.52]Left my stupid inhaler upstairs.
[311:22.59]This is the rest of the game.
[311:23.95]The rest of the game.
[311:25.75]You go up to Osborn and you find out the secrets.
[311:28.27]Should I make more than one diversion?
[311:49.26]Just make a mob.
[311:50.22]Definitely stay away from the receptionist.
[311:52.11]I've been coughing up a storm.
[311:56.03]Off limits, ma'am.
[311:58.75]Yeah, we have to cause a mob.
[312:02.75]Why isn't Osborne down here?
[312:04.11]This sort of thing never happens to him.
[312:05.93]Here we go.
[312:06.27]The mayor and his friends are exempt.
[312:08.83]Security let one of his biggest donors back upstairs right away.
[312:12.41]I knew it.
[312:13.35]It's all one big boy's fault.
[312:14.51]For every rock out, the score goes up by 0.5.
[312:17.32]That should do it.
[312:19.55]Jerry!
[312:19.81]Okay, I was definitely seen.
[312:20.65]But, whatever.
[312:22.93]Pick up the stun gun.
[312:24.61]Do I actually get a weapon now?
[312:25.73]Just run and who cares?
[312:55.13]Control.
[312:55.73]Grids clear.
[312:56.71]Repeat.
[312:57.47]Wait!
[312:59.35]I thought it was the stun gun.
[313:01.07]I thought it was like aim the stun.
[313:03.31]Whatever.
[313:03.73]Now take his gun and take his armor.
[313:19.88]Gotta turn him around.
[313:25.13]Oh shit, I was trying to hit it on the ceiling.
[313:26.65]Yep.
[313:27.77]Go.
[313:27.87]Unlock it.
[313:30.39]There's Norman.
[313:51.66]Okay.
[313:51.94]Did I do it?
[313:52.92]I did it.
[313:53.32]Get in there, hurry, before it closes.
[313:55.00]Wait!
[314:22.87]Okay, well, I guess I'm not allowed in there, so I don't... I can't, like, fucking stun them?
[314:40.03]They always do the little look.
[314:41.59]Hmm, I may have seen you, but I didn't.
[314:49.52]Stick your head out right was about to close and you give the finger.
[314:51.78]What are you gonna do about this bitch?
[315:03.65]And then they're all just waiting for me up here and it's like Norman's guards have all cleared out if he's hiding something up here.
[315:13.97]I'm gonna find it
[315:19.94]Lower the penthouse.
[315:21.62]What are you talking about?
[315:26.27]The elevator door opens.
[315:27.99]And there's 15 people.
[315:29.37]They're holding the rifles.
[315:31.23]And then she puts her hand down and does the fire sign.
[315:34.25]And it just... How is that?
[315:41.60]Is that that hard to understand?
[315:50.81]What do you guys not understand about that?
[315:53.47]...print for the apartment.
[315:55.13]Tons of empty space right behind the wall with a family portrait.
[315:58.97]Who leaves space unused in a Manhattan apartment?
[316:03.07]MJ, Sable presence downstairs just ballooned.
[316:06.17]I think Norman's being moved.
[316:07.71]Worried they might spot me.
[316:09.23]I might have had something to do with that.
[316:11.03]What is that?
[316:11.85]Keep your distance.
[316:13.09]I should be okay for now.
[316:15.71]What is this thing?
[316:19.97]Did I just put it on?
[316:20.79]Whoa.
[316:25.17]This mask is incredible.
[316:27.11]Why would you put on a random weird mask?
[316:28.45]Is it showing a door hidden in that wall?
[316:30.88]Hey, I did it.
[316:31.52]I don't have to do anything else.
[316:36.38]The fabulous Osborn.
[316:38.08]Norman bids his son farewell.
[316:41.58]This secret keypad behind the family portrait.
[316:45.17]Norman must like spy movies.
[316:47.17]I need to find the code for that keypad.
[316:54.56]Can't just guess?
[316:56.16]That's not fair.
[316:58.20]Alright, uh... Yeah, I need to find the code.
[317:00.84]1, 2, 3, 4.
[317:10.47]Mountain Spring?
[317:11.55]Better be.
[317:13.07]Well, uh...
[317:30.89]In the flower pot.
[317:31.93]In the bathroom.
[317:33.57]If it were me, I would put it right underneath the toilet.
[317:38.27]You know the part of the toilet nobody ever looks at, nobody ever cleans?
[317:41.85]The base of the toilet, where your legs are?
[317:43.95]I would write it right there with a magic marker.
[317:45.81]Is this got anything to do with the piano?
[317:59.23]No?
[318:04.99]Let's probably have to put the mask on again and look at a painting probably.
[318:07.77]Is this having something on it?
[318:10.25]Looks like a boatload of electrical is routed right behind that painting of Norman.
[318:14.54]Yeah, I know.
[318:15.98]I'm blind?
[318:17.18]Well, I'm looking over at chat too.
[318:19.74]I'm too.
[318:21.10]Too.
[318:22.30]I'm looking over at the chat room.
[318:29.40]Work order for a keypad lock.
[318:31.70]Looks like he used Harry's last day as the code.
[318:35.72]That must be the day Harry left for Europe.
[318:41.23]Client to set key button.
[318:42.53]This ain't even the right code, guys.
[318:43.71]Why did this just open?
[318:56.27]Okay.
[318:56.41]Alright, when did he go to Europe?
[318:57.27]What did it say?
[318:57.71]What day he went to Europe?
[319:19.61]Bottom of the tea kettle.
[319:21.37]It's gonna be in Harry's room.
[319:23.65]Hmm.
[319:24.01]So rich people smell like wine.
[319:27.65]Where's Harry's room?
[319:28.47]It just says, it's my trip to Europe.
[319:29.81]By Harry Osborn.
[319:48.90]City's in a state of emergency, but Norman still manages to get his laundry and cleaning done for him.
[319:54.88]What a hero.
[319:57.16]Order 50 pizzas to the penthouse.
[319:59.83]Hey, Dad.
[320:00.17]Here we go.
[320:00.83]Here it is.
[320:01.55]On my way to Dr. Michael's for one last shot before the big trip.
[320:06.81]Mm-hmm.
[320:09.27]Hey, if you're going to meet me there, could you grab my journal from my room?
[320:13.76]I just wanted to record some thoughts on the big bon voyage day.
[320:20.98]We better find a doctor's note or something.
[320:22.44]That was something we would cut it off.
[320:25.95]I don't even know where Harry's room is.
[320:30.83]It's just a maze in here.
[320:50.31]I've counted three living rooms.
[320:51.73]Probably... I don't know.
[320:54.51]Where do people keep keys?
[320:55.27]Okay.
[321:24.63]Got it.
[321:29.77]What?
[321:31.11]I'm so glad I just went to that first.
[321:35.21]This is Harry's room?
[321:39.97]What's wrong with Harry?
[321:40.61]Why didn't you tell us you were sick?
[321:46.97]Law books.
[321:48.33]Harry wants to be an environmental attorney.
[321:51.37]Like his mom.
[321:54.74]Harry's journal.
[321:56.00]His last entry is marked July 18.
[321:58.73]July 18.
[321:59.35]That must be the code to that room.
[322:04.11]July 18.
[322:04.65]0618.
[322:04.83]I am saying we should not rush off without a plan.
[322:12.35]We?
[322:13.49]You are staying here.
[322:14.77]The antiserum is ready, and I'm going to supervise production.
[322:18.49]You will be completely vulnerable without me.
[322:21.29]I seem to be completely vulnerable with you.
[322:24.41]I'm going alone.
[322:26.11]End of discussion.
[322:29.74]Keep team two on standby.
[322:31.90]I'm getting some air.
[322:34.88]Nice audio sync.
[322:35.82]Is there an audio?
[322:39.75]Is there an audio sync problem?
[322:51.46]is there hold on so is this this should be making a like a click sound it should be going right when it changes click click click is it no
[323:28.38]Has it been like this the whole time I've streamed this game?
[323:33.60]Or what?
[323:38.40]No.
[323:43.44]Let me see what happens if I do this.
[323:48.75]Only today.
[323:50.33]What have I done?
[323:59.26]Okay, what happens if I do this?
[324:12.03]Better?
[324:17.27]Fixed.
[324:21.13]That's so strange.
[324:21.91]I wonder why the hell it was doing that.
[324:25.94]Take the picture.
[324:30.32]I really hope that wasn't a problem the whole time.
[324:32.16]What I do, I just added 100 milliseconds to the capture for the PlayStation.
[324:34.86]I had to essentially tell the PlayStation 4 to wait 100 milliseconds before it showed audio.
[325:11.67]What the fuck am I doing?
[325:13.01]What am I doing?
[325:13.67]What the hell have I done?
[325:30.16]Where am I going?
[325:32.18]I just went in a fucking circle!
[325:44.44]Oh, seven.
[325:45.06]Okay.
[325:46.64]July 18.
[325:48.70]Bingo.
[325:53.77]Where the hell is the lab?
[325:55.31]Oh, you idiot, Jeremy.
[325:58.67]Super creepy.
[326:01.07]Gotta find the location of the devil's breath.
[326:03.31]Norman Osborn.
[326:04.23]GR27 research log.
[326:07.55]The whole project has gone to hell.
[326:09.29]GR27 is...
[326:13.25]I'm actually kind of annoyed that the audio has been off by 100 milliseconds.
[326:17.03]The whole time.
[326:17.59]It's not enough to really notice or care, but it's enough to be irritating.
[326:21.01]My immersion.
[326:42.82]devil's breath isn't a disease it's an attempt at a cure I almost can't believe it okay investigate the bed Norman wins the fancy map contest looks like the upper west side
[327:03.58]Huh.
[327:04.56]This shows all of Oscorp's properties.
[327:06.52]I had no idea they owned so much of New York.
[327:10.80]Looks like Norman's tracking Dr. Michaels' movements.
[327:14.08]Creep vest.
[327:15.43]Sable troop deployments.
[327:18.05]They're stationed all over the city.
[327:19.59]I bet I can find the Devil's Breath Lab with this.
[327:23.81]It must be an Oscorp property with a ton of Sable protection, frequented by Dr. Michaels.
[327:33.16]Nope, that's just Disable Patrol.
[327:36.12]None of these patrols cross Dr. Michael's path.

[331:54.62]Can we actually watch this on track?
[331:59.32]Oh, my God.
[332:02.02]Norman and Otto, they started all of this.
[332:05.00]They created Lee.
[332:08.23]I have to get this.
[332:12.45]God damn it, I'm out of space.
[332:13.79]Why do I have my fucking wedding on here?

[332:22.28]Why do I keep 5,000 wedding photos?
[332:26.38]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[332:30.22]I'm going to stun gun her, right?
[332:36.56]Oh, shit.
[332:37.00]No, this is the thumb drive I used to back up Windows 7.
[332:40.05]Damn it.
[332:41.47]No.
[332:41.85]Oh, no.
[332:44.05]Spider woman.
[332:46.01]Spider woman incoming.
[332:49.01]We have a breach.
[332:50.01]High alert.
[333:03.14]Pete, I've got the lab location and a lot more.
[333:07.08]How far away are you?
[333:08.54]I didn't even need to do that, I just... I have an insatiable bloodlust that cannot be quenched.
[333:13.81]I have to 100% the mission.
[333:48.36]Fucking bridge.
[333:56.75]How good's your arm, Mary?
[333:57.57]Standby, Control.
[333:59.87]I heard something.
[334:08.47]We need to clear that balcony.
[334:20.65]We got her.
[334:21.17]There's only one person left.
[334:22.53]He shot himself.
[334:23.17]Oops.
[334:23.41]She knows too much.
[334:25.97]Woohoo!
[334:26.23]Alright.
[334:50.98]I wish there was a cutscene cutie either.
[334:53.88]Switch it to Spider-Man and she falls right by you.
[335:02.02]I love that suit.
[335:14.39]I do, I love that suit.
[335:24.07]That would be really hard to hang on to.
[335:25.29]You really would be like... It's all so much to take in.
[335:29.14]Harry's sick.
[335:30.80]Norman and Lee and Dr. Octavius?
[335:33.74]Oh, you grabbed me.
[335:34.62]Oh, thanks.
[335:36.60]Spider-Man!
[335:39.26]It's not my fault.
[335:42.00]No, not this song again.
[335:43.14]It wouldn't even be that long.
[335:43.92]It would just be like, oh, I got you.
[335:44.87]I'm not alone anymore.
[335:50.35]Audio comedian.
[335:50.75]That would be like shooting a basketball through a hoop with a swish.
[335:53.33]So you go right through his arms.
[336:25.61]I'm hydrating.
[336:27.01]I've got some water right in front of me.
[336:31.13]How do you think I made those wet, slippery noises?
[336:32.23]Let's go take a look.
[336:32.89]New suit.
[336:33.17]Ooh, okay, hold on here.
[336:57.71]This one's kind of just like a blurry version of this one.
[337:02.73]Experimental Magnetic Weave generates an energy shield that temporarily absorbs all damage.
[337:07.04]The Frost one.
[337:08.94]Oh!
[337:11.82]Frost Spider-Man.
[337:13.00]What is this?
[337:13.78]Why is this Ghost Rider?
[337:23.90]I need two challenge tokens and four base tokens.
[337:30.65]Alright, I need to have this.
[337:34.85]We need to do two bases and complete one challenge.
[337:41.45]I think we're doing that.
[337:42.39]Let me see what else we got for skills here.
[337:46.27]Five, here we go, right in the middle.
[337:48.92]Perfect dodge, now I can do immediately
[337:53.50]Instant takedown.
[337:56.06]Need one more for the second finisher.
[337:59.62]That's very, very important.
[338:01.44]I'm going to hold on to it and get it.
[338:04.60]Okay, Norman's on his way to get the anti serum.
[338:06.82]Alright, let's find a spot where there is a challenge, right?
[338:16.28]There's a challenge over here.
[338:22.70]I think there's a base down here somewhere.
[338:25.53]There's two bases right here.
[338:29.35]Okay.
[338:31.29]Yuri.
[338:34.11]I hope this is good news.
[338:36.00]It is.
[338:36.94]Oscorp just created an anti-serum.
[338:39.24]There's a cure?
[338:40.52]Oh, thank God.
[338:41.84]How quickly can we get it to people?
[338:43.84]I'm on my way to find out.
[338:45.34]The lab is at 10th and Cathedral.
[338:49.73]not long has he looked at spider-man's Twitter yeah I don't know that could be Norman's how I got yesterday I'd send officers your way but I don't have any don't worry I'm on it with every celebrity and then a bomb challenge uh this is all I need I'm going to the right can't let any of those bombs explode
[339:25.45]Right there... Stomp!
[339:31.49]Last one!
[339:42.43]Go!
[340:08.02]close to perfection.
[340:09.92]Oh well.
[340:10.36]Three tokens.
[340:10.86]Don't even need it.
[340:12.52]Now let's clear the two bases.
[340:15.94]There's one down here and one down here.
[340:18.04]Times three and then times three.
[340:22.35]Damn.
[340:22.83]I used the tokens.
[340:23.91]That's unfortunate.
[340:24.95]Where am I?
[340:25.33]Is it close?
[340:27.05]No.
[340:27.25]Just get these two.
[340:28.43]And I can take the picture over there.
[340:31.27]Retry or riot.
[340:33.84]You're gonna have to riot.
[340:37.56]Can I wait?
[340:37.98]You need to pee.
[340:38.48]What's going on?
[340:39.12]What the fuck?
[340:41.00]Wait, what?
[340:41.26]Why is he here?
[340:41.60]Am I about to fight this dude?
[340:45.00]Holy shit.
[341:03.52]He said that as he grabbed your face.
[341:05.30]I'm gonna dodge.
[341:35.79]What are you doing?
[341:37.87]Don't take... I flashed him with the camera and it worked.
[341:43.58]Go fight him.
[341:44.60]Stop this.
[341:49.10]Alright, I'm going to use the arms.
[342:04.71]Great for me conclusion you lose
[342:21.43]Not yet.
[342:22.71]You'll find other challenges around the city.
[342:25.49]Once I've seen what you can do, we'll talk about round two.
[342:30.07]That's weird.
[342:30.75]He's kicking this guy's ass.
[342:33.53]I'm doing so great right now, don't you know?
[342:36.55]You got nothing on me.
[342:37.61]I know everything you're gonna do.
[342:39.06]I can see your mind.
[342:40.32]I can read your thoughts.
[342:43.64]Ow, please God, stop hurting me.
[342:48.59]Uh, that threw me off track here.
[342:50.27]Where am I?
[342:50.69]Alright, we gotta go down.
[343:10.95]I never hurt you, Jeremy.
[343:12.41]Thank you.
[343:13.25]That's very nice of you.
[343:22.32]Hey guys, bird watching?
[343:23.34]I saw some pigeons over there.
[343:48.24]What was the task for this one?
[343:49.91]Can't have the ones inside feeling left out.
[343:51.65]I see.
[343:51.97]So I can just remember it and have it here.
[343:53.89]Perform a 35-hit combo and do three stealth takedowns.
[344:00.06]Think I could make that happen.
[344:01.17]Going down.
[344:12.13]If you're gonna throw him off the building, why do you need to hit him eight times to injure him and anger him and make him feel bad?
[344:16.89]Three stealth kills.
[344:17.31]One.
[344:17.41]This could be two.
[344:18.81]Nobody else in here?
[344:42.29]But verticality.
[344:50.99]Two.
[344:54.29]Looking for three up here.
[345:00.35]I made too much noise.
[345:02.31]Everything just crashed.
[345:05.82]It's okay.
[345:06.32]I should be able to get this guy that's in the building now.
[345:10.57]There he is.
[345:11.45]I have my opportunity.
[345:12.69]I'll get it right now.
[345:13.79]As he comes down the stairs.
[345:16.08]There's three.
[345:16.94]Now I just need 35 hit combo.
[345:20.34]So what?
[345:20.82]I could kick everybody's ass.
[345:26.28]Can I do this 35 times?
[345:26.78]Alright, 35 hit combo.
[345:28.30]What do you say?
[346:11.16]I hope you new guys can up your game, because those last guys, gone.
[346:26.82]town shops what they're importing is not something I want as a memento come on somebody somebody demons looks like they bring in their buddies and shipping containers explains how foreign nationals with criminal records are getting into the country you guys look mad I admit I used all my good quips on the others but I don't mind repeating myself
[347:12.46]100!
[347:12.92]Who's left?
[347:13.78]Down.
[347:14.00]No, my combo!
[347:14.46]My combo!
[347:15.06]No!
[347:15.66]It's alright.
[347:16.32]I earned it.
[347:19.65]Oh well.
[347:21.03]I'm unfortunate.
[347:45.78]I forgot about the perfect combo thing.
[347:47.44]Let me see.
[347:49.66]Yep.
[347:50.10]Okay.
[347:51.34]I forgot about that.
[347:53.18]I know now.
[347:54.00]Ooh, you came out of nowhere.
[347:55.06]Let's just... Come on.
[347:57.41]This one went pretty quickly.
[347:59.79]Shoot.
[348:00.81]Shoot me.
[348:01.93]Shoot me.
[348:14.45]Shoot me.
[348:15.84]Shoot me.
[348:17.06]Do it.
[348:17.54]It'll be the last thing you ever do.
[348:19.02]We did it.
[348:49.71]Up, up, up, up.
[348:55.79]Still guys here?
[348:58.43]What's going on?
[348:59.15]Get up there!
[349:00.15]What?
[349:00.29]This guy's just walking around in a circle with this thing.
[349:24.44]No achievement for a 100-hit combo?
[349:27.47]I figured there would be something like that.
[349:36.51]I need to do that one more time.
[349:43.63]Throw them into the air and then web them, and then throw them back down.
[349:48.05]That's a good idea.
[349:51.71]That's a very good idea.
[349:55.94]Alright, last one.
[349:56.94]Which one's closer?
[350:01.25]What's closer to the actual mission?
[350:04.95]Where is the actual mission?
[350:05.97]I have no idea.
[350:06.67]Is it even on the map?
[350:15.96]Whatever.
[350:17.04]We're facing this way, so we're going to go this way.
[350:34.88]And then we get to be the ice ghost rider.
[350:43.87]We're from five area of, uh, trip mines.
[350:46.33]You got it.
[350:47.11]Trip mines.
[350:48.53]Hey guys, follow me!
[351:06.39]You know what?
[351:06.69]Just fucking put him everywhere.
[351:10.28]That was the worst place I could have put that.
[351:13.04]This guy has to... somebody has to jump.
[351:15.18]Alright, dude.
[351:16.12]Like... Is he tall enough?
[351:19.89]Oh, he climbed over it!
[351:21.69]Oh, what?!
[351:23.77]He climbed over the damn thing.
[351:25.51]Alright, I've had enough.
[351:49.14]Come on, I didn't get it.
[351:50.08]I'm just not in the right spot.
[351:55.39]Here we go.
[352:15.33]I need aerial attacks too.
[352:33.58]Alright, tripmines.
[352:39.48]That's not a tripmine.
[352:45.32]Is that too tall again?
[352:49.46]No.
[352:53.34]I don't think I generated any more, no.
[352:57.82]There's one.
[353:17.39]Need to grab another one.
[353:24.99]Still, nope, didn't get one.
[353:29.26]Alright, this guy, you, you, you asshole, seriously.
[353:33.86]Can I get him from here?
[353:35.32]No.
[353:51.47]Trip mines.
[353:52.17]Let's finish that up.
[353:59.55]This way.
[354:01.17]He's over here.
[354:01.77]Reinforcements.
[354:08.18]Okay, sure.
[354:08.82]I don't need sleep.
[354:18.56]Let's go over there.
[354:19.74]Can I throw it at you?
[354:20.46]Kind of.
[354:21.40]What the fuck did I just do?
[354:28.98]Oh, wrong one.
[354:55.29]How did you not get hurt by that?
[354:57.47]I find that to be stupid.
[354:59.78]Hang tight.
[355:00.80]Bad times, Paul.
[355:22.37]Talk to you soon.
[355:23.55]Give me the drugs.
[355:52.30]Okay, who's left?
[355:55.25]Guy across the way?
[355:56.75]Yeah.
[355:58.51]Let's say hello.
[356:02.75]Oops.
[356:14.55]Give me this.
[356:14.87]There's so many areas where they can be.
[356:25.50]Pretty clear.
[356:29.85]See ya.
[356:30.77]Who's left?
[356:57.62]Two guys on top of this roof here.
[357:01.66]Final wave.
[357:10.11]There's more.
[357:11.41]There's more.
[357:12.53]Let's get some fucking... these.
[357:27.39]Let me just do some gadget shit here.
[357:37.04]Uh, web bomb.
[358:00.95]Big guy.
[358:01.35]There's so many of them, they never stop!
[358:06.31]This guy's in an awkward place.
[358:15.19]Okay.
[358:49.13]One last guy.
[358:50.13]Hold on.
[358:52.45]Good shot!
[358:54.69]Just gotta get a quick pick!
[359:03.44]Just stay down here, please.
[359:11.50]Alright.
[359:12.42]Now we can get the suit.
[359:19.20]Let's see how cool it is.
[359:20.82]The siege of Manhattan Fortress is over, m'lady.
[359:24.53]Thanks.
[359:25.31]I'll send some buses to take those guys back to their cells.
[359:28.45]And please don't call me m'lady ever again.
[359:34.17]Good.
[359:36.30]It's time.
[359:38.14]Then there might be a new suit as well.
[359:39.92]Nope.
[359:41.00]Alright, do we spend all the money and get the weird frost one?
[359:43.28]That's six base tokens.
[359:45.72]That's a lot.
[359:49.16]This is very expensive.
[359:51.24]Okay, let's do it.
[359:54.96]Channels unstable waves of damaging ethereal energy from somewhere.
[360:01.18]Spirit fire.
[360:05.02]So it just makes a gigantic immolation aura around you?
[360:11.76]That's kind of cool.
[360:14.58]It's an unusual...
[360:18.19]Oh my god.
[360:20.19]Automatically consumes focus bar to heal you when you're low on health.
[360:24.51]No.
[360:26.14]Reduce the duration of the electrocuted status effect inflicted by stun batons and electric weapons.
[360:31.92]No.
[360:34.76]I'm going to take a little look at this in a second, but I should.
[360:38.15]No, I still have two.
[360:41.85]Let's see.
[360:44.98]Is there any more effects or is it... Yeah, that's cool.
[360:50.42]Now I kind of feel like Venom.
[360:51.90]This is cool.
[361:04.24]This looks great.
[361:08.35]Would you even recognize it's me?
[361:09.53]This is a different superhero entirely.
[361:13.34]I would be scared of this guy.
[361:14.16]Alright, let me pee one more time, and then we will keep going.
[361:19.70]One final pee.
[361:20.78]I'll be right back.
[364:31.21]Okay.
[364:37.37]I wish he'd mute himself.
[364:39.73]Huh?
[364:41.13]I also got a pretzel, too.
[364:43.35]Mm-hmm.
[364:52.32]Will you beat the game as Sans Undertale?
[364:54.60]Um, I don't know.
[365:04.21]Probably.
[365:05.29]Maybe.
[365:08.15]It depends on how annoying the head gets after another 30 minutes.
[365:12.50]We'll see.
[365:14.26]Does anyone else find it suspicious that this rhino person always knocks down buildings and tears up roads, which someone ends up making money rebuilding?
[365:24.67]Am I suggesting a conspiracy?
[365:27.23]You're damn right!
[365:29.11]Now, if you've seen the man testify in court, you know the rhino is too stupid to plan anything himself!
[365:38.24]Know your audience
[366:11.26]We're failing to finish Fallout 4 at set scale .5.
[366:28.60]Across the whole damn city.
[366:30.50]What?
[366:30.92]Wait, what is that?
[366:36.73]What is that?
[366:37.21]What is that?
[366:40.44]What is this, a bird?
[366:43.68]What is it?
[366:49.02]It's a phoenix.
[366:55.93]Get over here.
[366:58.61]What is this?
[367:04.39]Got it.
[367:05.09]OK.
[367:08.65]Got it.
[367:17.08]We unlocked more dialogue.
[367:18.04]Does Howard do something interesting?
[367:20.74]Get him off.
[367:58.99]I'm trying to just skim the ocean here.
[368:05.59]Oh, really?
[368:11.86]Not in the water again.
[368:13.12]Every time, guys.
[368:14.40]Every time.
[368:16.18]I traverse around with such grace.
[368:18.10]I fly around without any problems.
[368:21.66]And a lake shows up and I can't do anything.
[368:33.79]Just don't go over the water.
[368:34.95]Oh, fuck.
[368:40.65]I wanna go that way, so... It's cause the trees are spread out too far to grab onto.
[368:52.30]Fire's gonna go out.
[368:53.32]Whoops.
[368:59.84]Don't worry, everything's fine.
[369:01.89]Just go around it.
[369:06.47]Why would I do that?
[369:07.37]It's so much faster to fly over it.
[369:12.27]Which I've never been able to accomplish the entire time I played the game.
[369:16.39]But I imagine it would.
[369:24.70]Dude, the hand thing.
[369:29.81]There's the final fight with Mr. Lee.
[369:41.31]Open it.
[369:44.13]This is ridiculous.
[369:56.55]You know,
[370:02.84]It's a pretty cool Halloween costume.
[370:06.43]If you showed up at the party as just Mr. Lee, and then you went into the bathroom after an hour and just had a white suit and that white hairspray stuff, and it came out, you're like, it's me, Mr. Negative!
[370:30.40]A funny idea, I would do that.
[370:32.64]Although nobody cares, and nobody would even know.
[370:36.22]I mean, like, no one would know, anywhere that I went.
[370:40.07]I have a buddy that's huge, right?
[370:42.69]Absolutely massive dude.
[370:43.79]Like, this lad is an absolute unit, you know what I mean?
[370:46.55]Like, as the joke goes.
[370:49.09]So, I was thinking it would be funny, those of you that have seen My Hero Academia...
[370:54.98]I do an All Might scenario where I'm the little shitty All Might and I go in the bathroom and he comes out.
[371:00.56]And he comes in the bathroom and then I come out.
[371:07.80]And we just always can't be in the same room at the same time.
[371:25.59]jackass already did that?
[371:26.91]Yeah, but it would be... But nobody would even know what the hell it was.
[371:33.83]I don't even... I barely know what it is.
[371:46.52]Okay, the guy's shooting the missile.
[371:50.62]You... You've got to go.
[371:54.35]Right now.
[372:04.01]Where's this other guy?
[372:07.25]He went down somewhere.
[372:09.06]Who knows?
[372:09.56]There's so many buildings in the way.
[372:10.98]There you are.
[372:11.70]He's dead.
[372:12.10]Probably not.
[372:12.86]Who cares?
[372:27.49]If you're new to the channel, you might be.
[372:31.81]I've allowed one anime a year.
[372:35.31]That's it.
[372:36.83]People have suggested things.
[372:37.87]No, I'm sorry.
[372:38.53]You have to go to 2019 to be careful.
[372:40.59]I'm not paying attention because I really have to.
[372:52.12]I'm kind of just walking around and searching.
[373:01.44]Spider-man, leave now.
[373:07.16]My men will handle it.
[373:08.12]Leave?
[373:08.74]Sable?
[373:09.76]Lee wiped out the agents stationed here.
[373:11.80]They're not handling anything.
[373:13.79]You have been warned, superhero.
[373:16.37]Who the fuck is this guy?
[373:22.63]What?
[373:24.33]Okay, back to Sneaky Spider.
[373:26.61]What?
[373:29.00]Okay.
[373:36.92]Same deal on the other side?
[373:37.90]There's just a guy somewhere around here.
[373:47.65]No, I'm not leaving the mission.
[373:50.45]Sable made good on her threat, but these guys aren't looking to team up.
[373:54.33]Tired of you harassing our agents, Spider-Man.
[373:56.47]This ends tonight.
[373:57.28]You guys think I took out your men?
[373:59.78]You've got to be kidding me.
[374:01.96]Okay, well.
[374:03.06]That was interesting.
[374:11.80]Get up there.
[374:16.37]Okay.
[374:19.86]Oh my god, I'm losing it.
[374:22.22]I'm actually losing it.
[374:27.88]I think I'm getting tired.
[374:31.16]Is that what happens when you get tired, right?
[374:34.30]No, I haven't died in like seven hours of gameplay, right?
[374:37.66]Like by an enemy.
[374:38.38]Hold on.
[374:50.63]Yes I am.
[374:55.23]I'm dead.
[374:59.09]Ugh.
[375:06.98]I'm about to hit the point of exhaustion.
[375:08.32]It's gonna happen here soon.
[375:10.02]I hope I'm close to the end of the game.
[375:34.67]Halfway through!
[375:37.19]Oh, God.
[375:38.91]I really wish Saber would cut me some slack.
[375:42.38]We should be on the same team.
[375:43.48]What the fuck are you?
[375:46.46]Jeez, come on.
[376:21.73]What the hell am I doing?
[376:22.91]There we go.
[376:34.65]Oh my god!
[376:35.99]This guy's getting lit up right now.
[376:45.00]Did he just counter me?
[376:48.40]That just happened, didn't it?
[376:59.88]Every single one of you motherfuckers have a projectile weapon?
[377:25.31]Why did that happen?
[377:44.70]Where is he?
[377:44.98]Get the fuck out of here.
[377:49.21]There's the blue.
[377:49.67]Screwing with me being able to see the blue above my head.
[378:10.69]You harass my men, destroy my equipment, and cost my client millions.
[378:15.42]Give me one good reason I should not kill you right now.
[378:17.82]Listen, I don't like you, and you don't like me, but Lee has your client inside this building right now, and he's gonna kill him if we don't do something.
[378:24.52]The mouth doesn't move.
[378:25.54]We could fight each other.
[378:26.42]Wait, the mouth doesn't move anyways.
[378:29.30]It's Spider-Man.
[378:30.94]Of course the mouth doesn't move.
[378:32.94]What am I talking about?
[378:36.91]It's just that the whole big smiling with mouth with the teeth, I expected to talk.
[378:40.77]Does this mean we're good?
[378:47.07]You will help me secure Norman.
[378:48.89]After that, I make no promises.
[378:50.67]Works for me.
[378:52.79]Lee's out of control.
[378:53.75]That's the teeth.
[378:59.43]You secure Osborn.
[379:00.99]I will take care of him.
[379:04.96]Why do they have friends?
[379:08.39]Okay.
[379:09.13]Okay, Lee.
[379:10.11]No more running.
[379:10.81]Find Norman.
[379:11.53]This ends tonight.
[379:14.85]This is insanity.
[379:16.03]Norman.
[379:17.65]I have to find a way to reach them.
[379:19.11]Only I know.
[379:19.77]The man who built Feast.
[379:26.51]Going out here?
[379:28.29]No way to go but down.
[379:29.13]Alright.
[379:35.07]Found him.
[379:36.15]Oh, here we go.
[379:36.87]Another nightmare level.
[379:38.03]Just traverse.
[379:39.23]Where the hell did you go?
[380:01.71]Oh no, it's Big Gap.
[380:03.15]My parents died because of me.
[380:05.54]Because of what Osborn did to me.
[380:07.30]So that happened when he was a little kid?
[380:10.66]Is that what I'm understanding here?
[380:12.10]You're more than your past.
[380:13.64]Don't let it control you.
[380:15.58]I tried so hard to make my parents proud.
[380:19.20]To honor their legacy.
[380:23.65]But to truly honor them, Osborn must see justice.
[380:28.51]I won't let you do this, Martin.
[380:32.89]Walking?
[380:33.21]No.
[380:34.61]Just slowly through the door.
[380:35.91]It'd be funny if that's all you needed to walk.
[380:42.48]Then you could go back to flying around.
[380:48.90]I hate him.
[381:07.25]Hahaha Whatever the new suit is I'm putting it on No, no, it's an 88 Isn't it This is the only sample
[381:39.34]No!
[381:40.54]No, Martin!
[381:41.38]Look... ...I told you, I'm sorry.
[381:46.32]It was an accident!
[381:48.06]I was... ...trying to help!
[381:51.14]You don't help people... ...you use them.
[382:07.45]You won't bring your parents back!
[382:11.44]That would have the same reaction.
[382:12.52]Why do you insist on trying to save this piece of scum?
[382:17.69]I'm trying to save you, Martin.
[382:19.98]Don't let revenge win.
[382:21.58]Fight it.
[382:40.64]Time for us to have a final battle.
[382:43.78]It looks like it.
[382:44.42]Wow.
[383:11.02]This isn't you!
[383:39.91]Rip him out.
[383:40.49]Rip him out.
[383:40.89]Oh, now that was fucking cool.
[383:48.78]Did you see that move there?
[383:51.18]That was poetic.
[383:59.64]Ultron's crimes will be on your end!
[384:13.24]Boing!
[384:18.92]Aw, I'm trying to do something cool.
[384:33.95]Dammit.
[384:34.67]Phase 3.
[384:35.67]Fight it, Martin!
[384:36.97]You can walk away!
[384:38.93]No!
[384:40.11]Osborn must suffer!
[384:43.47]oh that really is kind of ruining this box I think it's time to do this I know you can beat the demon mark beat the demon I am the demon
[385:14.47]Oh, shit, that hurt.
[385:25.09]What's he doing?
[385:26.61]What are you doing?
[385:30.41]What's he doing?
[385:32.03]Oh, shit.
[385:36.49]Oh, shit!
[385:42.13]You and Oswalt will share a grave!
[385:49.86]I keep going at the wrong time here.
[385:53.84]Ow.
[386:00.60]Oh, fuck, not again!
[386:06.72]Jump!
[386:08.53]Oh, wowie!
[386:10.23]That's enough!
[386:19.76]This will all be over soon.
[386:22.36]I sure hope so.
[386:23.66]I'm just going to stay in the air for a little bit here.
[386:31.80]Oh, never mind.
[386:32.46]My will is strong.
[386:50.24]There's too many.
[386:55.85]Too many!
[387:38.64]That's not it.
[387:43.86]Really?
[387:44.18]Stupid.
[387:44.88]That's it.
[388:14.84]I'm going to rip it out of him.
[388:18.60]I'm going to strip.
[388:38.32]Osborn... ...needs to pay.
[388:41.90]I know.
[388:46.17]But this is the wrong way, Martin.
[388:52.53]Here comes Octavius.
[388:53.91]It's all about peace.
[389:06.15]Useless.
[389:07.04]No!
[389:08.00]You're not great.
[389:36.18]He's a scary guy.
[389:42.82]It does... It ruins every cutscene.
[390:02.41]It has to go.
[390:08.64]Otto?
[390:16.67]That look on your face.
[390:29.27]You can't imagine how satisfying it is.
[390:35.82]Ready for your final act?
[390:52.40]Yeah, I gotta get this thing off.
[391:19.97]It's too much.
[391:21.21]It was too expensive, and now I have to take it off.
[391:35.06]Leave it on.
[391:40.45]We'll see.
[391:40.93]Whatever the next one is, if it's not good enough, I'll keep it on.
[391:48.12]What's going through his face?
[391:49.04]Oh my God.
[392:19.23]This is not even funny either.
[392:20.59]This is sad and bad and not cool.
[392:23.01]I thought that was Spider-Man's mask.
[392:46.92]He'll live, but he needs rest.
[393:01.75]I'm sorry ma'am but he's turned into a skeleton well wouldn't you take his clothes off wouldn't you take his helmet his face thing off too they say she could go at any moment
[393:23.57]You wouldn't keep this person in full costume.
[393:25.83]Where are you going?
[393:26.63]You unzip the mask.
[393:27.13]I need to find Otto.
[393:28.19]He has the anti-serum.
[393:29.29]I don't know if I can beat him.
[393:36.06]Maybe you can't.
[393:38.60]Maybe Spider-Man needs help from his friend Peter.
[393:40.96]What?
[393:43.86]Sneak into the building and stealth through and then talk to Otto and remove two points from the game's final score.
[393:57.59]Go get him, Tiger.
[394:14.08]It's gonna go bite him.
[394:17.86]We're gonna get Spider-Man, too.
[394:21.88]Alright.
[394:22.30]No.
[394:27.45]No, that's not it.
[394:30.01]Maybe it's this one.
[394:32.48]No.
[394:33.72]There it is.
[394:37.10]And he killed it.
[395:03.78]This thing has to go.
[395:05.42]I have to get rid of this.
[395:08.72]It's ruining everything.
[395:11.38]It's making every single thing a comedy.
[395:13.64]Hold on.
[395:13.88]Hold on.
[395:14.08]Alright, hold on here.
[395:14.70]This sucks.
[395:49.95]Man, I gotta change this number.
[396:16.85]So close to being good news
[396:45.15]This is your last chance to upgrade gear and abilities before the end of the story.
[396:48.83]Oh, well, this is the final mission.
[396:51.17]Did I get it?
[396:53.73]I got it.
[397:43.43]I made my bed, I have to sleep in it.
[397:56.12]Hey!
[397:58.62]Hey!
[398:00.42]Oh.
[398:03.75]At least we got the guitar.
[398:05.77]We did the impossible, Doc.
[398:11.55]But now I have to destroy it.
[398:17.09]Am I gonna make my own Spider-Man suit?
[398:19.35]Ah, I get it.
[398:23.57]They do this whole montage and it ends up you're in the pajama suit.
[398:28.78]Or it's you're in the underwear.
[398:31.62]I couldn't figure it out.
[398:32.48]I had no idea.
[398:33.48]This is nice.
[398:48.11]That's really nice.
[398:49.33]That's the Venom suit!
[398:56.31]That's the symbiote Spider-Man, isn't it?
[398:58.32]That's the same kind of symbol on the front, too?
[399:08.82]Well, I know it's not the Venom suit, but it's got the same, uh, spread on the front, doesn't it?
[399:16.79]Oh no!
[399:17.55]No!
[399:24.77]here's what's going to be real funny it's going to go back to the white ghost ride immediately after that whole content you want me to beg not gonna happen the world will know the truth before they mop you off the pavement
[399:55.10]No, don't tell Harry You stole my company my ideas now the truth
[400:24.88]The truth, okay.
[400:29.98]The truth is, you were only ever worth a damn when you worked for me.
[400:37.03]The truth is, you could never accept that I'm better than you.
[400:42.07]You're a failure, Otto, and you always will be.
[401:05.65]Here we go.
[401:07.39]The final fight.
[401:09.39]This is Dr. Octopus.
[401:16.56]Give me the anti-serum!
[401:18.98]Otto, you've worked your whole life to help people.
[401:27.78]You're fighting the wrong man.
[401:29.88]I have to be like, it's me, Peter Parker, and then make him have the brain scramble like, I can't, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[401:56.57]Resupply.
[401:57.07]What the hell is this thing doing?
[401:58.49]Resupply.
[402:00.76]Just give me the anti-serum.
[402:02.44]You've already done enough to ruin our board.
[402:05.26]No!
[402:06.46]He always bounces back.
[402:09.13]He had to lose everything.
[402:11.09]Throw some shit at him, I think.
[402:20.46]Can I grab something?
[402:22.18]Can I go up the top, up the tower?
[402:24.00]Okay.
[402:24.46]Okay, okay.
[402:26.72]I can grab these.
[402:28.22]Can I have these if I go up here?
[402:31.44]Oh, here we go.
[402:33.00]Okay.
[402:52.88]I got a dog better here.
[402:55.08]You're wasting my time!
[402:56.90]I don't know, I guess there is something to keep my electrocute working really well.
[403:15.07]Osborn's the criminal, not me!
[403:23.07]Oh, this is like gadget refills.
[403:30.89]That is probably pretty effective.
[403:34.35]Gotta get all real for him.
[403:52.50]I got, uh, I got Web Bomb, let's use it.
[404:23.95]Is that gonna be enough?
[404:24.97]It's not enough.
[404:31.39]That is.
[404:31.81]Get to the ground!
[404:52.86]I probably should do the resupply thing, right?
[404:56.92]Yeah, I'll give you a kill here.
[405:01.00]Stuck.
[405:02.08]What else do I got?
[405:04.27]Uh, I should probably refill.
[405:05.95]I'll do it one more time.
[405:07.97]I am getting some health with the...
[405:22.28]Gotta move.
[405:25.60]Gotta move.
[405:53.52]Into his head.
[405:56.30]Rip it off!
[406:10.81]We still go to the top of the tower.
[406:12.77]Is this gonna go in the air?
[406:13.69]Oh, shit.
[406:22.62]You knew the whole time
[406:48.43]This means too much to me!
[406:50.07]Back when he said, oh, you're Spider-Man's engineer.
[406:52.03]More than it means to me!
[406:56.19]Killed one leg.
[407:03.02]We're gonna have a cling to the side of the building fight.
[407:18.66]Did you see all the people you're hurting you'll never understand you haven't suffered like I have this is awesome I
[407:47.18]This is a great final scene here.
[407:48.72]Right into the camera, looks great.
[407:53.37]Oh my lord.
[408:08.90]Stop trying to grab my face.
[408:11.06]Think of the man you were.
[408:13.54]That man is gone.
[408:15.82]You can't save me, Peter.
[408:18.85]Then I guess you'll have to save yourself.
[408:21.57]You were my hero.
[408:29.05]Damn.
[408:31.07]Oh, he got me.
[408:32.41]You meant so much to me.
[408:42.31]I hate that you're making me do this!
[408:46.31]We were going to change the world!
[408:51.75]Oh, I think it's scripted, actually.
[408:53.22]Grab you.
[409:01.32]Oh, I just don't know which way he's going to go!
[409:13.63]I knocked his glasses off.
[409:14.49]He got himself up.
[409:16.19]Ooh!
[409:44.09]If you want to change the world, you have to be the kind of man who can make the hardest decisions.
[409:56.03]I couldn't agree more.
[409:59.41]Got it.
[410:02.55]Good thing, Otto, you didn't go for the heart.
[410:07.77]You know, the heart's on the other side.
[410:19.79]Now everybody's going to know.
[410:38.06]Peter, I saw you as a son.
[410:43.95]I should have known you'd turn on me just like all the others.
[410:52.26]I've worshiped you, your mind, your conscience, wanting to help others, the way you never gave up.
[411:00.39]That's because men like us have a duty, a responsibility.
[411:08.50]to use our talents in the service of others.
[411:11.86]Even if they don't appreciate us, we have to do what's best.
[411:17.03]Those beneath us, whether they understand it or not.
[411:21.61]No, you're wrong!
[411:25.11]You were everything I wanted to be!
[411:26.79]You just threw it away!
[411:33.10]Yes, of course.
[411:34.86]You're right, Peter.
[411:38.38]I see that now.
[411:41.02]The neural interface affected my mind.
[411:43.54]Here's the bait.
[411:46.12]I can fix it.
[411:47.28]Here's the bait.
[411:48.30]The last, I'm going to kill you.
[411:49.79]We can fix it together.
[411:53.91]Just come closer.
[411:54.45]If you'll help me.
[411:56.95]The ultimate end of the game.
[412:00.01]I'll make sure you get the best of me.
[412:02.05]No!
[412:03.80]If they put me away...
[412:06.45]THEY'LL TAKE MY ARMS!
[412:11.23]I'LL BE TRAPPED IN THIS... ...USELESS BODY!
[412:20.79]Please, Peter... ...that... ...wasn't me!
[412:28.65]You said... ...you'd never abandon me!
[412:32.93]You promised... ...remember?
[412:37.98]Don't do it.
[412:40.06]Don't fall for it.
[412:40.72]And of course, you rest easy.
[412:44.92]Knowing your secret is safe with me.
[412:51.55]You do what you think is best, Doc.
[412:53.99]It's all any of us can.
[412:57.57]Peter?
[412:58.73]Even when it hurts like hell.
[413:01.15]Peter, where are you going?
[413:04.05]Peter!
[413:04.55]Peter!
[413:16.21]Well.
[413:24.29]There's Spider-Man.
[413:27.85]Here come the credits.
[413:28.45]See, they're going to go... Oh, never mind.
[413:31.22]We have to find out that Miles is now Spider-Man 2.
[413:44.41]It's still viable.
[413:45.77]We'll need the entire sample as a base to produce more doses.
[413:49.53]How long will that take?
[413:50.37]A few hours.
[413:52.79]Maybe a day.
[413:58.30]What if we use it to cure someone right now?
[414:10.23]I'll give you a few minutes.
[414:12.81]Oh, man.
[414:32.98]Are you going to be okay, ma'am?
[414:35.08]I've got the cure right here.
[414:38.28]Take off your mask.
[414:41.44]I want to see my nephew.
[414:49.77]Aunt May knows?
[414:50.95]You knew?
[414:53.53]I've known for a while.
[414:54.91]Everybody seems to know.
[414:56.19]I did.
[414:59.10]You know, Peter, we all fucking know.
[415:03.20]What gives it away?
[415:04.80]Your voice.
[415:06.77]And how tall you are.
[415:13.45]I don't know what to do.
[415:16.87]Yes, you do.
[415:41.38]What if you just did a little bit?
[415:45.24]Like, what if you just did a little bit?
[415:46.48]Is she dead?
[416:03.03]No.
[416:04.17]It's still beeping.
[416:05.81]No.
[416:09.17]Never mind.
[416:09.79]Oh, man, that's...
[416:15.50]Jesus, a lot of awful things happen in this game.
[416:24.72]I jinxed it?
[416:25.50]No, everybody has the same game.
[416:43.02]So when does he become Spider-Man?
[417:07.09]That's sad.
[417:28.85]Here he goes.
[417:53.73]That's pretty terrifying.
[418:02.31]so hi Mary jane watson associate editor congrats I knew you could do it you turn around Stanley it's the same restaurant oh no but uh I'll be right with you honey thank you I was actually considering maybe a career change yeah I think I might want to become a chef I'm sorry no it's you're a scientist a good one
[418:32.61]The last project I worked on, I created a monster octopus that almost destroyed the city.
[418:38.29]Yeah.
[418:41.37]I mean, you do make a hell of a chicken curry.
[418:45.69]Here's the great thing, though.
[418:46.91]Still working on my dumplings, though.
[418:48.72]Didn't have to bring this below a 90.
[418:52.06]Going camping?
[418:52.64]That would have been real sad if this was an 88.
[418:54.16]My new place isn't going to be ready for that.
[418:55.44]I would have been really sad about that.
[418:56.50]So I'm going to be crashing with Miles for the next few nights.
[418:58.92]Oh.
[419:01.54]You know... ...you can always... ...stay at my place.
[419:07.28]Only if you want to.
[419:08.95]No, I... I mean... I mean, yes, I mean... ...no, no, I don't... I not want to, meaning I... I do want to, but... ...only if you do.
[419:18.84]I never stopped wanting to.
[419:20.16]Me neither.
[419:32.00]Okay, well, there it is.
[419:36.47]That's it.
[419:36.81]There's Spider-Man.
[419:43.29]I think that gets a solid 90.
[419:49.87]Stealth missions were a little unnecessary, in my opinion.
[419:53.83]And... That's pretty much it.
[419:56.71]That's, like, the only complaint that I have.
[420:01.04]I want this suit!
[420:02.54]Don't skip the credits, I won't.
[420:29.07]Uh, yeah.
[420:31.73]Was it 17 hours?
[420:34.29]Or just the... I mean, obviously I didn't do everything.
[420:39.22]It was a lot that I didn't do.
[420:41.02]That's probably another... That's probably 15 hours on top of it.
[420:47.58]Maybe like 10 to 20 hours, depending on how quickly you do them.
[420:50.80]Of that side content.
[420:51.78]Getting all the tokens.
[420:52.95]This is probably like a 40 to 50 hour.
[420:55.31]If you do everything.
[420:57.43]Maybe.
[420:57.57]Maybe.
[420:59.61]That's good length.
[421:00.37]That's 15 to 20 hours for the story.
[421:02.75]And if there's a ton of side content, you can still do.
[421:06.51]And there will be... No, there is DLC.
[421:07.87]There already is.
[421:09.35]Isn't it already coming?
[421:10.07]Isn't it coming out at the end of the month or something?
[421:16.40]Credits are safe to skip.
[421:18.40]Are we sure?
[421:18.78]Comes out next month.
[421:23.42]Still, that's really close.
[421:25.92]So I can hit circle right now.
[421:28.08]I'm seeing some no's here.
[421:31.69]I'm seeing a lot of no's.
[421:35.29]Oh, Jesus.
[421:37.61]I'm seeing more no's than I'm seeing yes.
[421:42.17]We're already waiting.
[421:53.12]We're just hanging on.
[421:56.18]Uh... I doubt that we... I would say this is probably the best... This is probably the best game I've played this year.
[422:02.19]Now, there is a lot of stuff that I haven't played, and there are a lot of games that are yet to come out this year.
[422:08.17]But out of the ones that I've played, this is definitely going to be on the top five list for a lot of people, I would say.
[422:27.42]I'm making another one, too.
[422:31.99]I don't know why they wouldn't.
[422:36.25]I mean, I'm not even sure they need to make another one.
[422:41.17]The foundation is here.
[422:43.66]Just make a few really great DLCs.
[422:45.98]You can charge a lot of money for them if they're full of content.
[422:50.40]Add another two dozen story missions or a dozen story missions and a few more bosses.
[423:01.29]If there's three DLCs planned.
[423:02.77]Yeah, so I mean, they got plenty of... Alright, here we go.
[423:06.77]I'm not an expert or anything, but I think it's in the way that you asked her.
[423:11.07]I've been getting too nervous.
[423:14.20]Hey, alright, so where do you want this?
[423:15.70]Right over here is fine.
[423:17.04]Alright.
[423:23.50]Hey, so Pete?
[423:24.38]Yeah.
[423:24.58]It's the new apartment.
[423:26.30]I kind of got to talk to you about something I can't tell my mom about.
[423:30.15]What's up?
[423:32.05]Well, um, weird things have been going on like physically.
[423:39.16]Oh, Oh, uh, well, you know, you're at that age where, where your, your body starts to change and you may be noticing some areas, for example, not that, uh,
[423:58.27]I think it's... I think it's better that I just, um... I show you.
[424:03.54]I show you.
[424:04.46]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[424:08.62]It's pretty weird, right?
[424:12.96]I can do it, too.
[424:16.41]Not that weird.
[424:21.43]Skip.
[424:24.02]Well, additional cast.
[424:25.34]Short order cook, Stan Lee, and then everybody else.
[424:32.58]Now I can skip this.
[424:41.75]Yes, yes.
[424:43.85]You can.
[424:44.59]You can.
[424:45.07]People are saying I can skip this.
[424:47.29]You can skip.
[424:48.17]Okay, here we go.
[424:50.10]This better be right.
[424:50.84]This better be right.
[425:11.37]He's going to look in the mirror and it's going to be the goblin talking to him.
[425:40.28]We were so close.
[425:48.48]But I'll keep trying.
[425:52.72]I will find a cure.
[425:57.27]I will.
[426:02.69]I love you, son.
[426:16.09]What the hell?
[426:22.48]Is Harry his venom?
[426:35.27]I didn't expect it.
[426:36.47]We haven't seen it in a while.
[426:39.57]That's not confirmed that he's venom.
[426:42.54]Congratulations, you've reached the main story, but the adventure continues.
[426:44.68]You can now change the time of day.
[426:47.02]Good luck.
[426:49.44]Well, there we go.
[426:51.50]There's Spider-Man.
[426:58.49]He's dead!
[427:00.61]He snapped his neck right there.
[427:01.95]It's over.
[427:06.55]Alright.
[427:09.23]That's going to be it for tonight.
[427:12.31]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[427:12.95]New suits.
[427:13.35]Let's take a look at them.
[427:18.27]Well, there it is.
[427:23.98]This one is affordable.
[427:27.18]Everyone goes down in one hit, including you.
[427:29.10]There's nothing there.
[427:31.10]I can't do it.
[427:31.74]Complete all main mission side quests and reach 100% district completion.
[427:36.23]This is the naked guy.
[427:37.41]Undo it.
[427:40.12]And then I can obviously, this is the anti-arc suit.
[427:44.48]Complete all black cat stakeouts.
[427:46.17]It's just, okay.
[427:47.41]So what about these ones?
[427:48.05]I wonder what these are.
[427:49.41]Locked at level 41 and 45.
[427:50.43]Do it.
[427:55.01]Do it.
[427:55.61]Oh yeah, let's do it.
[427:56.71]Let's do it.
[427:57.27]Alright.
[428:02.94]That is gonna be it.
[428:03.84]Is that Twitch?
[428:07.00]No.
[428:11.57]I will see you guys.
[428:12.61]I'm not going to stream tomorrow.
[428:13.51]I'm going to take a day off here tomorrow.
[428:18.24]And then from there... From there, we'll figure out what's going to happen on Friday.
[428:25.00]I didn't do this yet.
[428:25.80]Let me just do this before we leave.
[428:38.80]Let me, like, read bits while I do this.
[428:41.76]We'll do the credits after as well.
[428:42.95]I want to get to the top of the tower there.
[428:43.95]Thank you, Pocket Farm, for the $1.
[428:44.75]Hyped for Vegas.
[428:45.31]Me too.
[428:46.19]I'm very hyped for Vegas.
[428:48.47]I can't wait.
[428:48.91]Thanks a lot, man.
[429:05.32]Thank you, Ann Doxson, for the $2.
[429:06.72]Hey, Dermot, don't know if you've remembered me since it's been about a month, but I finally more recovered from my surgery in August.
[429:13.19]You told me to keep that upstairs mentality in check, baby.
[429:17.63]I'm recovering way faster than the doctors thought I would.
[429:21.11]Thank you for the amazing streams, and keep doing what you're doing.
[429:23.57]Love it.
[429:25.01]That's awesome to hear.
[429:26.21]Ann Doxson, that's absolutely awesome to hear.
[429:37.57]All of us here are very glad about your quicker than normal recovery.
[429:46.17]Thank you so much for the $2, dude.
[429:48.81]Wish you the best.
[429:55.64]We can't hear you?
[429:56.58]Wait, what do you mean?
[429:58.04]Is this too loud?
[430:03.40]Congrats on the recovery.
[430:07.35]You guys can hear me.
[430:08.17]Well, the game is just too loud.
[430:14.75]Well, I'm sorry about that.
[430:20.74]I've never even been up here.
[430:21.96]There's even more to this.
[430:25.96]That was Andoxin.
[430:27.56]Let's just perch up here and look.
[430:29.28]Now that is cool.
[430:30.99]That's very cool.
[430:35.67]That deserves a selfie at some point.
[430:39.66]And Doxin, thank you again.
[430:43.06]Thank you, Miguel, for the $1.
[430:45.64]Squirts for the $1.80.
[430:49.33]Love you and everything you do.
[430:50.27]Hope the move goes smoothly.
[430:51.59]I've gotten a few more responsibilities now, and I don't know if you remember, but a while ago I told you one of my problems with alcohol.
[430:57.83]Hopefully this will get my mind onto more important things.
[431:01.24]Anyway, again, you're awesome.
[431:02.26]I cannot put into words how much your streams and your channel are worth to me.
[431:05.64]Thank you.
[431:06.38]Hope your days are as awesome as you.
[431:11.14]Thank you, squirts.
[431:16.08]Hopefully, you start to go on the right path there.
[431:19.93]We all wish you the best, man.
[431:25.21]Much love to you.
[431:26.07]Thank you, squirts.
[431:28.87]Statue of... We didn't see the Statue of Liberty either, but hold on.
[431:32.02]This is really important.
[431:35.42]No, it's the wrong thing!
[431:36.44]It's the wrong thing!
[431:37.56]It's the wrong thing!
[431:46.52]Hold on.
[431:49.50]It's the wrong thing.
[431:50.40]I have the wrong suit power on.
[431:54.38]It took it off.
[431:54.94]I didn't do that.
[431:55.70]It did it on its own.
[431:59.64]Suits.
[432:01.64]Suit power.
[432:02.28]Here it is.
[432:05.43]Here we go.
[432:09.59]I don't have enough power.
[432:10.73]Fuck.
[432:13.07]I have to wait a little longer.
[432:23.55]Get up there.
[432:24.03]What are you doing?
[432:27.96]Okay, it's going to take like a couple minutes.
[432:31.08]Just don't.
[432:32.14]I just can't move.
[432:36.08]Squirts, again, also gave $50 before.
[432:39.06]We touched upon it, but thank you so much, dude.
[432:44.95]Oh, no, Jerma, don't do it.
[432:46.11]Thanks for the $1.
[432:46.89]Hey, Jerma, I changed my Twitch name for a dumb joke, and now I'm stuck with it for six months.
[432:51.65]Anyways, here's a dollar.
[432:52.53]Love your streams.
[432:53.17]You won't imagine how fun they are.
[432:55.83]Also, it makes me sad when I see that you have to stop playing a game you enjoy because Twitch Chat is having a hissy fit.
[433:04.14]Keep doing the things that you love.
[433:07.12]I think he's referring to... He's referring to Two Point Hospital.
[433:13.94]How can I tell what my juice is at?
[433:19.02]Thank you so much.
[433:19.66]Oh, no, Jerma, don't do it.
[433:23.10]I can't really see it on the screen.
[433:27.22]There it is.
[433:27.94]Okay, here we go.
[433:28.44]You ready?
[433:34.39]Yeah!
[433:35.87]It fucking turned off.
[433:46.15]Ugh.
[433:56.33]Take off two letter grades.
[434:00.45]Wait.
[434:02.45]Summer salt the water?
[434:04.41]I will.
[434:07.28]Thank you, The Viking Howard, for the $15.
[434:08.88]Thanks, Viking Howard.
[434:12.08]And you say, Hey, Germo, you're seriously the funniest guy I've ever had the pleasure of watching.
[434:17.68]Thank you so much for just being you.
[434:21.24]Thank you, Viking Howard, for the $15 and the incredibly nice message.
[434:27.86]Here we go.
[434:45.06]Cannonball is cannon ending.
[434:47.42]I keep going up here and doing this, man.
[434:50.92]Counted 12.
[434:53.18]Cannonball into the water.
[434:59.60]Okay.
[435:08.26]Cannonball into the water.
[435:09.32]Where's the Statue of Liberty?
[435:10.74]Over there.
[435:13.17]So let's perch here.
[435:14.09]I'm going to jump off and I'm going to do one of the quick dives.
[435:16.89]And then we'll cannonball into the water.
[435:21.59]Thank you, Viking Howard.
[435:22.47]Thank you, Lemon Pudding for the $1.
[435:23.63]Do my best impression of me, Jerma985.
[435:25.45]Okay, sure.
[435:31.05]So what we're going to do is we're going to go to the Statue of Liberty, and I'm going to jump off and do a couple of cannonballs, and hopefully land in the water.
[435:38.48]I think that was alright.
[435:41.22]Thank you, Dong Tiu, for the $10.
[435:42.82]Hey, Germo.
[435:43.32]Been watching you for years.
[435:45.18]Been subbed for a few months.
[435:46.62]I'm a little strapped for cash, but just wanted to show support.
[435:55.42]I love you and this community.
[435:57.23]Keep doing what you're doing, buddy.
[435:59.29]Much love.
[436:00.99]Thank you, dude.
[436:01.59]Thank you so much, dong.
[436:02.67]Here we go.
[436:03.03]Do the... No, flip into the water.
[436:05.05]I can't flip into... I couldn't do it.
[436:30.79]Can Spider-Man not swim?
[436:47.05]Return.
[436:47.65]Cannonball arm.
[436:48.77]Not a true ending.
[436:53.19]It's not possible.
[436:55.13]I'll try it again.
[436:57.03]Thank you, Snooze and Copter, for the $1.
[436:58.17]I just thought I'd share this.
[437:00.47]During the Miles sneak segment, my playthrough went a little differently.
[437:06.63]And then it's a link here.
[437:07.53]Let's see.
[437:13.67]How do I link this?
[437:25.82]Right here.
[437:27.22]I don't think I can put this on the stream.
[437:30.08]But here.
[437:31.64]Take a look.
[437:33.26]Let's see how you snuck around.
[437:36.96]Did you just walk straight through?
[437:38.47]Wait, what?
[437:48.73]I'm so confused.
[437:51.64]Hurry up so I can sleep.
[437:52.76]Alright, hold on.
[437:53.54]I'll get this.
[437:53.90]I'll get this.
[437:57.80]Cannonball into the water, here we go.
[438:00.48]Alright, it has to be like this, you ready?
[438:06.66]Come on, that's gotta be it, right?
[438:07.75]That's gotta be far enough.
[438:10.05]Into the water, do it!
[438:20.14]It won't let you, yes it will!
[438:27.11]I can't do it, guys.
[438:28.16]I can't.
[438:31.84]No, it won't let you do it.
[438:35.50]Can you not go to the Statue of Liberty?
[438:36.80]Hold on.
[438:43.95]I went too far.
[438:46.69]But also, Snoozencopter says, also, did you know that in the Jerma version of Spider-Man, the enemies turn into chickens when you beat them?
[438:53.22]Since chicken brutality is accepted in Germany, but not beating up people.
[439:02.12]Really?
[439:02.42]That just seems so out of place.
[439:06.21]Just don't go too far.
[439:07.63]I can bounce off from here.
[439:09.03]So if we launch towards the Statue of Liberty, this should do it, right?
[439:11.21]Let me see what's in the way.
[439:13.74]That... mmm... I'm gonna have to go that way.
[439:16.56]Here we go.
[439:24.26]Cannonball into the water.
[439:27.02]Here it comes.
[439:28.81]Don't go too far!
[439:30.07]I did it.
[439:36.31]I even added a spin in there.
[439:37.49]No, let's go to the Statue of Liberty.
[439:45.49]Can I go to the boat?
[439:46.71]No.
[439:47.51]You did it wrong.
[439:49.55]I was going too far.
[439:50.67]I wonder if I can even go over there.
[439:55.59]Hold on.
[439:59.57]Didn't roll into the water.
[440:00.65]Yes, I did.
[440:00.91]Let me see it from up here.
[440:05.55]Let's take a look.
[440:09.30]As we continue to scroll through the Brits.
[440:10.98]Thank you.
[440:11.40]As we continue to scroll through the Brits.
[440:12.96]I'm slurring my words here.
[440:14.56]Drinking of water.
[440:16.52]Zazz Assault, thanks for the $1.
[440:17.66]Please stop talking about pears.
[440:19.36]I'm vegetarian.
[440:23.95]What do you mean?
[440:31.89]Got it.
[440:36.10]Thank you, though.
[440:36.46]Thank you, Snowleo.
[440:39.62]Thank you, Snowleo, for the $10, Snowleo.
[440:42.42]Jeremy, you've been a huge influence in my life and sense of comedy.
[440:44.98]Thanks for everything.
[440:47.00]Thank you, Snowleo.
[440:51.64]I am happy to be an inspiration.
[440:55.14]That's an incredibly humbling thing to hear.
[441:00.37]I'm glad that you enjoy the content, and I'm glad you enjoy the stream to a point where it is influencing your own way that you think about things.
[441:11.02]Thank you so much, dude.
[441:13.04]Really appreciate it.
[441:15.74]Future Gamer, thanks for the $2.
[441:16.94]Another video.
[441:17.54]Love these Spider-Man streams.
[441:20.48]Let's see.
[441:30.18]Oh, yeah.
[441:32.42]I know what this is already, don't I?
[441:38.39]We need audio for this one.
[441:46.40]He did the thing that we talked about already it's gonna be great Yeah, that's it.
[441:52.53]Okay.

[442:20.23]Thank you so much, Future Gamer.
[442:23.40]I don't think you can go.
[442:26.36]I don't think you can go to the Statue of Liberty.
[442:29.10]I don't think you can.
[442:29.64]I'm going to try to just jump over there very slowly.
[442:43.55]Thank you, smelly boy, for the $1.
[442:44.95]Would you let the... Wait, what?

[443:38.35]Thank you, Glowdrug for the $1.
[443:39.81]Hey, Jerma, have you played God of War yet?
[443:41.53]I have not.
[443:44.45]I've heard it is amazing, though.
[443:48.72]I was told I have to experience it.
[443:50.92]I was told by more than one person that it is the best game on PS4.
[443:57.72]But I have not played it yet.
[444:01.32]I was kind of waiting for the hype to die down a little bit because everybody was so into it and everybody was streaming it.
[444:07.60]Combat challenge.
[444:08.40]Might as well just do this.
[444:09.16]I can't really read bits when I do this, though, so never mind.
[444:13.68]Am I going to play it on stream?
[444:15.46]Probably.
[444:16.82]I would assume that would happen fairly soon.
[444:19.10]Probably fairly soon.
[444:19.86]Because there's a lot of shit coming out in the end of October, end of November.
[444:27.87]Also, thanks to the streams, doing the world a service.
[444:29.93]Thank you so much, Glowdrug.
[444:34.58]Thank you, Dr. Clay, for the $1.
[444:36.16]Peter Parker picked a marker.
[444:38.12]How many marks did Peter Parker mark with his marker?
[444:40.56]Two.
[444:41.46]Two.
[444:41.60]Fujiogi, thanks for the $1.10.
[444:42.40]Have some bits, you dirty, stinky man.
[444:43.50]Dirty, stinky man.
[444:43.98]I don't know who's an enemy here.
[445:04.51]I'm not dirty and stinky.
[445:13.27]Rude.
[445:14.81]Can I read bits and do this?
[445:15.99]Definitely not.
[445:16.71]Let's see if I die here.
[445:18.63]Uh, thank you Div USP for the four dollars.
[445:23.30]No message, thank you.
[445:24.08]Appreciate it, dude.
[445:29.38]Oh, hold on, let me do this.
[445:30.82]Let's just have somebody else play the game for me.
[445:32.54]Like these guys.
[445:35.10]Thank you, Nopski, for the $4.
[445:36.94]No message.
[445:37.40]Thank you, Nopski.
[445:43.64]Hold on.
[445:44.22]Let me give it to this guy.
[445:49.52]Thank you, Stardust Crusader, for the $4.
[445:52.90]I forgot that Jack Ryan personally gave me these bits.
[445:58.19]More Jack Ryan bits.
[445:59.41]Thank you so much, dude.
[446:01.55]Put on the negative suit.
[446:02.39]Do I have enough to do it?
[446:04.96]I don't think I have enough to put it on.
[446:16.69]There it is.
[446:17.41]Well, guys, we're going to be bad news.
[446:18.83]Thank you, Stardust, though, for the Jack Ryan bits.
[446:20.81]Thank you, DJack.
[446:22.19]You're OK, my boy.
[446:27.10]Wait, what?
[446:29.14]You made the Marvel joke in Master of Comedy 209 instead of the channel you made, which was The Master of Comedy 209.
[446:39.18]No, that's not true.
[446:41.30]I did Master of Comedy.
[446:47.40]There is no, it doesn't matter.
[446:49.10]Like I told you before, they're all from, we're all from the same place.
[446:57.49]Thank you, though.
[446:57.93]Thank you, Superintendent Chalmers, for the $1.
[446:59.87]It was .
[447:00.41]Let's do this.
[447:03.31]What if I do this?
[447:08.43]Because the stream is technically over.
[447:11.43]So let me go like this.
[447:12.91]Can I paste?
[447:13.59]Yeah, I can paste that.
[447:16.21]Let's put the outro here.
[447:19.05]We're going to mute the outro, though.
[447:25.22]Because I'm just kind of dicking around.
[447:32.13]There.
[447:33.05]Just so people know.
[447:38.02]Just so people know.
[447:39.64]Right?
[447:43.76]Thank you, Superintendent Chalmers.
[447:49.57]Where, where, where, where, where?
[447:52.31]Thank you, Superintendent Chalmers for the $1.
[447:54.15]It was said somebody bought the Avengers Tower in Spider-Man Homecoming.
[448:00.05]It might be our board, our boy Norman.
[448:03.89]It's hard to look back and forth and play.
[448:07.81]Reduced expectations, thanks for the $4.
[448:14.51]Take these free bits.
[448:17.49]I absolutely will.
[448:18.47]Thank you so much, man.
[448:21.08]Hey, Brogers, Brogers, Brogers, thanks for the $1 here.
[448:29.29]On stealth takedowns?
[448:33.11]That wasn't a stealth takedown.
[448:43.15]Whatever.
[448:46.23]Broguer says, long time fan here.
[448:47.57]I've looked up to you for a long time now.
[448:48.91]You're truly an inspiration to me.
[448:51.11]You and your content has done so much for me over the years and it would mean so much to me if I could have a Fortnite burger, please.
[448:58.73]Uh, what's a Fortnite burger?
[449:02.97]A Fortnite burger?
[449:07.83]Is that... What does that mean?
[449:15.84]He doesn't know.
[449:19.88]Fortnite burger.
[449:22.68]Well, I'm sorry I can't give that to you.
[449:24.18]Hopefully you find out a place to get that.
[449:25.96]I don't know where to get it.
[449:29.07]Hopefully, maybe like fucking Burger King will do it one day.
[449:31.17]Who knows?
[449:34.51]What am I getting attacked?
[449:36.11]These guys with the guns in the background, man.
[449:50.87]There we go.
[449:51.67]Get up in here.
[449:55.97]That's it.
[449:57.41]Uh, thank you, though.
[450:00.47]Thank you to Canon Inspector for the one dollar.
[450:03.29]We've got to find Otto.
[450:05.31]We found him.
[450:06.19]We got him.
[450:07.75]Ricearoni, thanks for the one dollar.
[450:08.91]Hey, Jerma, not sure if you remember me.
[450:10.11]Gave some bits yesterday.
[450:11.03]Was having issues with messages.
[450:12.44]I think it's because I pretty much wrote a wall of text.
[450:17.00]Anyway, gonna keep this to the point.
[450:19.76]I said you helped inspire me to hit the gym and I lost 80 pounds over the course of a year and a half.
[450:26.30]Holy shit, man, that's awesome.
[450:32.06]Wow.
[450:35.10]Actually, that's incredibly impressive.
[450:39.75]Uh-oh.
[450:43.09]My web slinger's getting low.
[450:47.03]Thank you so much, Riceroni.
[450:51.56]And I'm glad you're living a healthier lifestyle.
[450:56.61]Again, Rice-a-roni here for a dollar.
[450:59.69]But then gained it back after losing all motivation thanks to depression.
[451:03.40]Anyway, with this new semester starting, I decided to start going to the gym again.
[451:09.90]But I overheard some guys laughing at me the other day.
[451:12.22]About my size, to put it lightly, also a pun.
[451:15.37]Hold on.
[451:17.75]I'm going to get stuck in a wall here.
[451:22.97]I've been feeling like trash since then and have kind of lost all motivation again.
[451:26.45]Just wondering if you could give any advice that could help.
[451:30.81]Well, first of all, here's what I'd say.
[451:35.63]You did it before.
[451:37.65]You can do it again.
[451:38.15]You know what I'm saying?
[451:43.85]If you've already done it once, that means you have the strength and the ability to do it again.
[451:52.42]So that's number one.
[451:53.70]Number two, I don't know, are people laughing at you in the gym?
[452:02.03]That's fucking ridiculous.
[452:03.11]That's bullshit.
[452:03.75]Everyone's there for the same reason.
[452:07.97]If you go to the gym, you're there to make yourself a better person and get in shape.
[452:18.27]That's what everyone's doing there.
[452:19.41]That's kind of...
[452:20.87]Annoying that somebody at a gym would laugh at somebody for being in the gym trying to do the thing that they... are... should... that they're there for.
[452:33.14]But... I think you can definitely do it again.
[452:38.52]It's fucking awesome that you did it before.
[452:43.64]We all wish you the best of luck, man.
[452:47.11]And then Rice Roni again for $3.
[452:48.83]Nothing else to say, just giving the last of my bits.
[452:53.44]Well, thank you so much for that, man.
[452:58.42]Hopefully you get back on that healthier lifestyle.
[453:05.39]And fuck what people say at the gym, man.
[453:09.09]You get, like, healthier, you walk in there, those same dudes that are doing the same fucking three exercises, they'll be quiet real quick.
[453:20.81]The type of person that laughs at somebody in the gym is the type of person that does bench and the leg press and then goes home.
[453:29.14]So, I wouldn't worry too much about that.
[453:35.26]Bench only.
[453:36.10]Yeah, that too.
[453:42.49]Only leg day.
[453:46.87]They do curls in the squat run.
[453:48.55]Yeah, I don't really...
[453:51.47]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer.
[453:54.47]Let's give Bloodborne a high five, and then I'm going to close the game out.
[453:57.27]We'll just get to bits exclusively.
[454:01.23]Maybe not.
[454:01.61]I like this.
[454:01.93]It's kind of fun just walking around throwing stuff at people.
[454:05.48]Bad people.
[454:08.04]It's a Discord link from Garfield.
[454:11.88]What the hell is this?
[454:15.90]Why?
[454:16.48]What is this?
[454:22.54]Okay, um... You're champion in the middle of battle, you'll be happy to know he wound up winning the fight.
[454:29.90]I love how Japan has an annual mascot fight.
[454:32.54]Good thing I don't live in Japan.
[454:33.88]Odie and I would be bottom tier on the wrestling slate.
[454:36.95]The fight suggests Jerma rumbles, but with a thousand entries, and all of them are funny guys in mascot suits.
[454:42.47]And then there's a YouTube link here.
[454:52.59]I guess they show them?
[454:53.84]What the fuck?
[455:01.50]Why?
[455:02.98]Why?
[455:06.77]Is that what that lady's trying to fight me for a second?
[455:10.51]Thank you for that card for the Monday Killer, and I'm glad I won.
[455:13.63]And I'm glad that that exists.
[455:17.03]Captain Worgen, thanks for the one dollar.
[455:19.14]Why do we fuck up and not fuck down?
[455:24.79]I don't know.
[455:29.15]Why do we fuck up when we don't fuck down?
[455:31.05]That's true.
[455:33.97]That's a great question, Warden.
[455:36.24]I'm not sure.
[455:36.56]I can't answer it.
[455:37.16]Thank you, Vertical, for the two bucks.
[455:38.42]Hey, Jerma, as always, love you, and I wanted to show a good clip with sub-sound potential.
[455:43.46]It was from the Overcooked 2 stream of the Talics, which I feel is an underrated stream.
[455:49.66]And here's a dollar again.
[455:51.16]It's me.
[455:51.54]Forgot to link the clip.
[455:53.11]It's another excuse to give you money.
[455:54.28]Let's see what it is.
[455:57.02]Yeah, we also... We do fuck off, too.
[455:58.58]We fuck up, we fuck off.
[456:01.30]We don't fuck down.
[456:03.20]Odd.
[456:04.16]Alright, let's see.
[456:06.20]Mushrooms.
[456:12.78]Jesus Christ.
[456:14.52]Mushrooms.
[456:17.93]That's... That's like the...
[456:23.29]That's fucking embarrassing, man.
[456:26.49]That's like an... That's actually... That is... That is the ha-ha.
[456:35.87]That's like the original... Jesus Christ.
[456:46.12]I hate to bring that up, but... Mushrooms.
[456:51.99]It really is.
[456:53.65]God, that's embarrassing.
[456:55.09]Whatever.
[456:58.79]It's a plate, plate, plate, plate, plate, plate.
[456:59.97]Mushrooms.
[457:05.96]That would distract me every time I heard it.
[457:09.02]Thank you, Vertical, for that.
[457:10.10]Also, thank you to Tankles Crown.
[457:13.70]Tankles Crown gave five gifted subs earlier.

[457:25.73]Thank you so much, dude.
[457:28.15]You guys can't hear this anymore, can you?
[457:30.47]I should probably switch it over.
[457:31.37]Yep.
[457:34.87]I should do that, shouldn't I?
[457:36.85]Okay.

[458:08.64]Pick it up.

[458:29.42]Epic!
[458:30.40]Oh shit, hold on.

[459:38.04]Is it a video?
[459:41.82]I can't hear it.
[459:51.67]Wait, I'm confused.
[459:52.61]Am I still playing?
[459:53.21]I'm just doing bits and running around town.
[459:58.17]I have to change the audio over to play this.

[460:03.27]Tiger Lotus, thank you for the bits.
[460:04.87]Thank you, Just That Guy, for the $1.

[460:09.73]Let's look.
[460:12.49]No, they're not there.
[460:14.09]I don't think the Ninja Turtles are in New York.
[460:15.44]No, yes they are.
[460:17.74]Are they in New York?
[460:21.38]They might be.

[460:51.20]How you doing?
[460:52.06]Well, thank you.
[460:54.22]TheJack473, thanks for the two bucks.
[460:56.92]Fun fact of the day, air is 78% nitrogen and only 21% oxygen.
[461:01.42]So when you think of oxygen being a air, you're at least three quarters wrong.
[461:11.29]Well, that's good to know.
[461:14.09]Let's switch this over and actually start to end the stream.
[461:19.14]Like this.
[461:19.85]Hey, now you can probably hear this.
[461:21.95]Let's make this a little bigger.
[461:23.29]Why don't we?
[461:29.39]That's good to know.
[461:30.95]I did not know that beforehand.
[461:33.94]But thank you, TheJack.
[461:34.62]Thank you, Cookie.
[461:37.44]Cookie, thanks for the $1.
[461:38.48]You got the worst ending.
[461:40.10]Or the best ending, depending who you ask.
[461:42.86]MinuteMage, thanks for the $5, MinuteMage.
[461:44.66]Thanks for the stream, my guy.
[461:45.88]Thanks for the $5, MinuteMage.

[461:50.64]Appreciate it.
[461:52.14]Hey, Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1.
[461:53.10]Do you plan on going back to this when the DLC comes out?
[461:56.70]Depends on how good the DLC is.
[462:00.69]I would make that a strong maybe.
[462:05.21]Gas Station.

[462:28.65]Thanks for the $2.60.
[462:31.65]Can you and Critical do a collab for the next Jerma Rumble or his Sodden Super Slam?
[462:39.46]I've talked about collaborations before.
[462:42.38]They happen organically or they just don't happen.
[462:44.02]It depends.
[462:46.52]I cannot give you a yes or no answer to that.
[462:49.39]Every collaboration I've ever done has just happened organically.
[462:53.66]We'll see.
[462:53.92]I don't know.
[463:00.88]I don't know.
[463:02.90]I have no answer for you.
[463:04.71]But thank you so much, Galaxy Mouse, for the $2.60.
[463:06.55]Hey, thanks for the $4 hint of hat.
[463:10.79]No message, just a heart.
[463:13.57]Thank you.
[463:17.13]Clueless sniper, thanks for the $1.
[463:18.55]This is why chat wanted you to do a cannonball.
[463:24.89]Wait, wait, wait.
[463:28.04]Let's watch it.
[463:36.46]Ow.
[463:38.92]Alright, why did chat want me to do a cannonball?
[463:48.52]Why is it so loud?
[464:13.60]I see.
[464:14.38]Okay.
[464:15.38]Well, that would have been really funny if that happened.
[464:18.24]Too bad it did not, though.
[464:20.80]Thank you, Clue the Sniper, for the $1 and for your clarification on why.
[464:24.91]Mr. Picklesworth, thanks for the $4, Picklesworth.
[464:28.45]Hey, Jeremy, I know you get this a lot, but you definitely aren't an inspiration to me.
[464:31.65]Just your mentality towards making actual good content instead of just pumping out shit.
[464:36.17]Yada, yada, yada.
[464:37.09]Heartfelt message.
[464:38.95]Out of the way now.
[464:39.91]Watch my masterpiece.
[464:41.01]K, thanks.
[464:41.67]Bye.

[465:59.41]Let me get it here.
[466:12.09]There, there, there.
[466:18.38]This is called The Essential Crisis.
[466:25.86]My birthday's, like, next week.
[466:29.67]What is it now?
[466:30.29]Yeah, I'm turning the... Oh, man, I don't like this.

[466:47.37]I'm not gonna live to be 100.

[466:55.69]I'm not going online and typing in that, that like, what are you gonna, what date are you gonna die?
[467:00.59]I'm not doing that.
[467:01.47]What's that Twitch shirt?
[467:07.00]I did that once and I never, I'll never do it again.
[467:08.48]Back when I was in high school.
[467:10.10]Dude didn't want it.
[467:13.81]I'm not doing it.
[467:17.95]Fine, I'll do it.
[467:23.81]That was a cut there.
[467:24.59]That could have been like two hours.
[467:26.54]I was born... Okay.
[467:30.16]Male mode.
[467:32.20]Normal, pessimistic, sadistic, or optimistic.
[467:34.42]What would you guys say?
[467:35.16]I think I'm fairly normal.
[467:40.26]Right?
[467:42.24]Come on, one of those isn't even me.
[467:44.06]One of those ain't even me.
[467:45.10]I'm not sadistic.
[467:46.88]Fuck out.
[467:48.42]I am not sadistic.
[467:49.53]I am very normal or pessimistic at worst.
[467:56.51]I'm not sadistic.
[467:58.01]How am I sadistic?
[467:59.45]Fuck out of here.
[468:01.30]Fucking Jesus.
[468:02.62]What have I ever done that's been sadistic?
[468:06.76]Why?
[468:07.84]Don't, come on.
[468:09.20]What's my BMI?
[468:11.26]I am a non-smoker.
[468:12.20]Let's put that very clear.
[468:14.80]And my BMI is very good from what I remember.
[468:20.29]Okay, 5.8.
[468:20.61]That was a good one.
[468:23.65]That's pretty good, right?
[468:25.79]Is that good?
[468:26.09]20.59.
[468:26.11]Hold on.
[468:41.32]That's a long way, right?
[468:42.28]That's 2018 right now.
[468:42.90]28, 38, 48, 58.
[468:43.28]68.
[468:43.34]Okay, so I got about 40, 30.
[468:44.92]Wait, 70?
[468:45.14]78?
[468:45.16]73?
[468:45.18]No, that's not correct.
[468:45.88]73?
[468:46.00]I'm not clicking that link.
[468:48.70]I'm not clicking the link.
[468:49.50]You can stop spamming it.
[468:50.48]I'm not going to click it.
[469:11.03]I don't click links.
[469:11.79]I don't want to click.
[469:12.33]I'm not clicking that link.
[469:13.35]I'm not going to do it.
[469:15.09]Good.
[469:15.35]I'm glad he's not going to do it.
[469:16.27]I appreciate this thing right here that's at the bottom of the page.
[469:19.61]I appreciate that talking to you.
[469:23.57]I'm not going to click it.
[469:26.49]I agree.
[469:26.79]I don't click links.
[469:27.81]I already know what it is.
[469:32.28]I agree with Jerma from two days ago.
[469:40.61]Pointing is rude.
[469:41.57]Not when you're trying to make a point.
[469:50.88]I didn't click it.
[469:51.46]I was browsing Reddit.
[469:52.40]I heard something was funny on it.
[469:53.94]Jeremy, you are going to die at 73.
[469:55.88]Have fun while it lasts, old man.
[470:11.81]I agree.
[470:16.19]Stop showing that.
[470:24.35]Stop showing that.
[470:25.97]God.
[470:26.87]God fucking damn it, man.
[470:45.00]God damn it.
[470:45.86]Right at the fucking end, too.
[470:54.72]Come on.
[470:55.74]I can't believe he died at 73.
[471:09.47]Thank you for that video about how old I am.
[471:20.40]I can't steal Jupiter.
[471:21.44]It's good enough.
[471:21.98]It takes practice.
[471:26.22]Thank you, Mr. Picklesworth, for that video.
[471:30.45]Thank you.
[471:31.41]Mad47, thanks for the two bucks.
[471:32.87]You're the best.
[471:33.37]I hope you have a great night.
[471:34.79]I actually got to head out for the night.
[471:36.31]I got an exam tomorrow and I need to rest.
[471:37.91]Have a great night.
[471:38.85]Good luck with Vegas.
[471:40.78]Thank you.
[471:41.58]Mad47, have a great night.
[471:44.50]Hopefully you have a good time.
[471:47.20]Hey, DigitGuy, thanks for the $1.
[471:49.26]I love you more than beans.
[471:52.23]I don't think that's very hard because beans are gross.
[471:54.73]Well, hold on.
[471:55.81]I'll rephrase that.
[471:56.85]Baked beans are delicious.
[471:58.19]Kidney beans are delicious.
[472:00.35]Fava beans are really, really good for you.
[472:01.83]They're really delicious as well.
[472:03.85]Black beans are fantastic.
[472:05.08]They really go great in tacos.
[472:08.28]Pinto beans also go great on a lot of different Mexican foods.
[472:14.64]I think they're all actually pretty good.
[472:18.51]Actually, they're not good.
[472:23.01]That's... Actually, beans are fantastic.
[472:30.38]Thank you, man.
[472:30.82]That's hard to do.
[472:32.00]To be loved more than beans.
[472:34.66]Thank you, cool54864 for the $1.
[472:39.38]This is a video of the best skin in the game.
[472:42.49]That's not it.
[472:48.87]It's the comic book suit, apparently.
[472:55.51]Oh, that's like the cell shaded.
[472:56.89]That looks pretty great.
[472:59.91]That looks real... Actually, that looks kind of like he's in front of a green screen.
[473:05.37]Doesn't it?
[473:06.96]Here, look at this.
[473:07.68]Guys, look.
[473:08.02]You can click anywhere.
[473:09.06]It looks like somebody put this in front of a green screen.
[473:13.70]He's like, that doesn't belong in the game.
[473:17.33]He's just kind of flying around in his studio.
[473:21.58]Looks cool, though.
[473:27.66]It's really cool, actually.
[473:29.62]Too bad we didn't see it.
[473:31.30]That is LinkedIn.
[473:35.32]Thank you, Chubby Funster, for the $1.
[473:36.66]Hey, Jerma, what lies at the bottom of the ocean and twitches?
[473:41.91]A nervous wreck.

[475:21.48]I think I know the lyrics to the song.
[475:25.49]You know?
[475:26.55]I'm only the guy that wrote it.
[475:31.33]You don't go up to the pearly gates and knock on the door and God opens and is like, God, I know you wrote these Ten Commandments, but you didn't, right?
[475:40.90]Like, that's not what that... Don't misinterpret me.
[475:48.70]God, these are wrong.
[475:51.02]These Ten Commandments are incorrect.
[475:52.96]They're not right.
[475:54.90]What the fuck did you say?
[476:03.58]Maniac streamer compares himself to God.
[476:06.12]Arrogant streamer compares himself to God.
[476:08.86]Streamer claims to be God.
[476:10.33]Oh, man.
[476:23.53]Stop trying to be God.
[476:25.03]I'm not comparing myself to God.
[476:28.76]I'm just saying I know what it's like to be God.
[476:33.04]Oh, my fucking head.
[476:44.15]I can't laugh at this.
[476:45.07]I have to move on.
[476:55.49]Streamer says he's God and challenges his spot.
[477:00.47]That's going to be taken out of context.
[477:01.65]I know it is, but look, I can pretend like it's not going to bother me.
[477:11.56]Arrogant streamer shoves foot further into his mouth.
[477:14.78]No, this is all just jokes.
[477:16.76]I don't really believe that.
[477:21.10]This is all just like a, like a gotcha.
[477:25.83]I'm God.
[477:27.21]Really?
[477:35.41]He made all the planets in the solar system.
[477:37.30]No, he didn't.
[477:38.32]I did.
[477:38.70]I'm sick of hearing people talk about the planets.
[477:43.36]Oh, the planets, the planets.
[477:44.54]I made them.
[477:47.54]I made them out of clay and dirt and a little bit of water.
[478:01.91]Um, actually, I did.
[478:03.13]Alright, let's move on from this before I give people more clips to embarrass me with.
[478:18.47]Thank you, though, to... Where, where, where, where are we?
[478:22.73]Thank you, Chubby Funster, for the $1.

[478:29.01]Thank you, ParFollowMule, for the $1.
[478:30.73]You left my bit for dead, but maybe that was a good idea since this Jerma joke is questionable but highly applicable.
[478:37.47]What is it?
[478:38.17]I'm going to be playing Team Fortress 2 as... as... Oh my fucking God.
[478:51.74]What the hell was this?

[479:31.55]I mean, that's technically correct, but it's not going to be physically accurate.
[479:36.42]Shelby Funster, thanks for the one dollar.
[479:37.74]What do you call an alligator in a vest?
[479:39.74]An investigator.
[479:41.32]That was actually a pretty good one.
[479:43.42]Shelby Funster again.
[479:44.38]What happens if a frog parks illegally?
[479:46.28]They get towed.
[479:48.68]That one was even better.
[479:50.90]Hey, Vertical, thanks for the $1.
[479:52.08]Geez, I don't know why I'm so bad at writing bit messages.
[479:54.10]Anyways, quick Jeremy appreciation moment.
[479:57.61]If I could be friends with literally anyone that existed, I'd choose you.
[480:03.79]I'd give bits or anything to play with you in that new FromSoftware game.
[480:08.65]Well, I'm on the devil lettuce, which is optional.
[480:12.27]Anyways, I hope you find 20 bucks on the ground tomorrow.
[480:18.03]Wait, why on the ground?
[480:23.63]Thank you, Vertical.
[480:25.71]FromSoftware Game looks fucking incredible.
[480:28.05]I hope I do find $20 in the ground tomorrow.
[480:29.87]That would be awesome.
[480:32.13]Sekiro does not have multiplayer, I guess.
[480:34.54]The Devil's Lettuce, which is that marijuana cigarette I think you're describing.
[480:43.72]Friends with a God is what somebody said.
[480:53.89]You know, like Thor.
[481:01.12]Everyone thinks Thor.
[481:02.16]He's a god.
[481:02.86]He's a god of lightning and thunder.
[481:04.66]Yeah.
[481:06.76]Why don't you come knock on my door?
[481:12.48]See what happens to you.
[481:20.58]Thor, you want to go?
[481:26.25]Hello?
[481:29.79]Can you imagine me fighting Thor in real life?
[481:35.59]You know what?
[481:36.27]I would just... At some point, here's what I would do.
[481:42.79]I would have a grenade in my hand.
[481:45.47]I would have just like a meat cleaver in the other one.
[481:49.09]He gets close, just start carving him up.
[481:51.03]Just carve his fucking face up.
[481:53.67]And he's far away, I got a grenade ready to throw at him.
[482:00.20]That's all I would need.
[482:09.51]I got it all planned out.
[482:10.77]If I ever was a god and needed to challenge another god, grenade, cleaver.
[482:18.28]That's distance.
[482:20.62]That's close quarters.
[482:29.92]think that works for everything yeah have you ever heard of hubris I mean I'm I'm describing fighting a god with a meat cleaver and a grenade do you think that I really think this is gonna work
[483:00.46]Yes.
[483:03.76]But anyways, thank you, Vertical, for the $1 again.
[483:08.00]Also, I know how you feel about people giving money for the fuck of it, but I'm going to get that cool emerald green 75,000-bit badge because I really like green.
[483:17.59]And you.
[483:19.53]I really like you.
[483:22.93]Well, thank you, dude.
[483:25.11]And good luck on the green badge.
[483:28.39]Do you have it?
[483:30.41]Are you working towards it?
[483:33.47]Let's see.
[483:34.03]Do you have it yet?
[483:39.09]Thank you so much, though, Vertical.
[483:47.18]Can God go to the next term of Rumble?
[483:51.50]No, not quite.
[483:52.12]Not quite.
[483:53.46]Not quite there yet.
[483:55.87]But thank you, dude.
[483:56.41]Thank you, Minute Mage, for the $1.00.
[484:01.30]Uh, here.
[484:05.55]It's one of these.
[484:07.11]Okay.

[484:34.24]73.
[484:34.26]God damn it.
[484:34.94]A purse.
[484:56.88]Seven, no.

[485:12.17]Thank you.
[485:13.39]Thank you, Chubby Fuster, for the $1.
[485:14.69]A nurse once told me, sorry for the wait.
[485:16.31]I replied, it's alright, I'm patient.

[485:40.19]If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord.
[485:41.81]What is this?
[485:45.07]Why are you saying this?
[485:46.91]Vertical, thanks for the $1.
[485:48.07]Did you know the phrase okay originated in Boston?
[485:53.23]I saw that in a video on the front page of Reddit today.
[485:55.27]Maybe someday another phrase will become universal, which originates in somewhere like Las Vegas.
[486:01.09]Like I-L-A-V-I, a labby.
[486:04.28]I'm laughing about it.
[486:08.26]Chubby Funston, thanks for the $1.
[486:09.68]The inventor of the throat lozenge died.
[486:12.46]There'll be no coffin at his funeral.
[486:14.18]God damn it.
[486:22.15]And hey, what do you say we do the credits?
