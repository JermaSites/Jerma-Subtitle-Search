[00:01.58]I am the rocket man they talk about.
[00:04.81]I jump from star to star, I walk it out.
[00:10.81]This is gonna be my last one, guys.
[00:15.79]Okay, I guess I'll quit the game.
[00:18.21]It's my... What?
[00:20.79]Look at the teams.
[00:21.67]Oh, Optimus Prime?
[00:23.33]Is that... Sick.
[00:25.05]I'm appearing online.
[00:26.23]We all are.
[00:27.77]Sick.
[00:28.36]Let's do it.
[00:32.25]I can't believe I just killed that guy.
[00:33.45]I can't believe Optimus Prime joined.
[00:36.31]I think he just sent me a message.
[00:37.25]He's like, oh, you guys playing CS:GO?
[00:39.23]I think he just hopped in.
[00:42.58]CS, go, go, go.
[00:43.78]Oh, God.
[00:44.58]Recoil is so fucked up.
[00:48.88]I just thought I was on the terrorist right there.
[00:52.54]I am on terrorist.
[00:53.12]What the hell am I doing?
[00:56.01]I love the kill squish sound.
[00:58.97]Yeah, like the headshot kind of noise.
[01:01.65]Yeah.
[01:02.71]It's beauty.
[01:04.25]Wow, a nice goomba.
[01:05.23]Get out of my spawn, you faggot.
[01:13.14]I'm gonna knife your ass.
[01:15.84]Oh, what?
[01:18.52]Faggot.
[01:22.84]There's one bot.
[01:24.12]I'm gonna get that bot bastard in a second.
[01:26.02]I can join your guys' team if I want, but no, I don't want.
[01:29.00]Join.
[01:29.90]Join us.
[01:31.43]Oh, this team killed you.
[01:34.35]I saw a guy in counter-terrorist territory, so I shot him.
[01:38.97]My bad.
[01:39.53]I mean, what was I supposed to do in that situation?
[01:47.20]Yeah, just unload a clip on me.
[01:49.71]It wasn't even a clip, it was like two bullets.
[01:52.08]Why is it so that like my teammate has like the money bags?
[01:55.72]I don't know.
[01:57.36]Is it like a cashback?
[01:58.62]Oh my gosh, I saw 50 bullets bounce off that guy.
[02:03.56]Shibby, why you have to camp?
[02:05.04]Yeah, I was using a shotgun.
[02:08.71]Fuck my ass.
[02:11.25]Yes.
[02:11.87]There you go.
[02:12.69]Oh, to the left, to the left.
[02:14.73]Xander the bot.
[02:16.77]Just shot my teammate with a nice shotgun.
[02:20.25]That guy's still alive over here.
[02:21.65]Yeah.
[02:22.66]Nice.
[02:28.40]Oh, MLC_St3alth, you bastard.
[02:31.22]So where does MLC come from?
[02:35.06]Back when I was in sixth grade, some of my friends at school told me to change my gamertag so I could join their wicked cool clan.
[02:41.68]It just stuck.
[02:44.31]And it was short for malice, apparently, and we did some game battles for about a week, and then after that they were like, sorry you changed your gamertag, but we don't want to do this anymore.
[02:53.55]Oh, okay.
[02:54.29]So pretty much you run clan MLC now.
[02:56.86]Thanks for forcing me to change my gamertag for no reason.
[03:00.46]You're the clan.
[03:01.30]And then I just stayed.
[03:02.40]I forgot to change it, and then I made YouTube, and then I dwelt too late.
[03:06.77]Wow.
[03:07.61]You made YouTube?
[03:08.79]You must be pretty rich.
[03:11.55]Rich as fuck.
[03:13.49]I came back to this conversation at a really weird time.
[03:16.26]If you didn't know, Brett made YouTube.
[03:23.48]We're talking about how Mark Fontaine stole my idea.
[03:26.32]Mark Zuckerberg stole my idea.
[03:27.50]Mark Fontaine?
[03:28.76]Who the fuck is that?
[03:33.00]Fontaine.
[03:34.84]Mr. Fontaine.
[03:37.40]Someone's been playing too much BioShock.
[03:39.66]Hey, Frank Fontaine, don't spoil it, man.
[03:42.06]Spoilers.
[03:44.52]Seriously, every single time I die, it shows the other guy's health, and he has none.
[03:50.50]Oh, no Scrope!
[03:52.10]No Scrope!
[03:52.72]I think that was the last thing you said before I left.
[03:56.30]What?
[03:59.18]Every time you die.
[04:00.42]I'm reiterating it, alright?
[04:02.40]I'm getting deja vu over here.
[04:05.48]Cue Scrope.
[04:09.48]Where is this bastard?
[04:12.00]Fuck that.
[04:13.99]Hacker.
[04:15.89]Ow.
[04:17.53]Has gotten revenge on you.
[04:20.47]Oh my gosh, where the heck did you come from?
[04:23.03]Jump down from the depths of hell.
[04:24.95]Junkyard?
[04:25.37]Uh, a junkyard.
[04:27.93]I put some junk in your yard.
[04:33.78]God, who keeps telling me, texting me things?
[04:37.62]Trying to play Counter- Global Offensive, right?
[04:49.73]What?!
[04:51.21]Sneaky triangle.
[04:55.00]Good bitch.
[05:01.30]Bruh, let me kill you.
[05:02.86]Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[05:12.20]Ow!
[05:13.16]Not nice.
[05:18.48]Ugh.
[05:20.66]Only like a couple more kills and I'm gonna be there.
[05:22.88]Ah, you would have sniper rifle.
[05:25.56]You said that like over voice chat.
[05:35.21]Oh, get too late.
[05:36.01]I'm on knife.
[05:37.09]Let's get knifed.
[05:38.43]This will be our first gun game win.
[05:40.05]Beta.

[05:42.17]Beta, bruh.
[05:43.05]Beta blocker.

[05:48.84]Knife him.
[05:51.89]No!

[05:57.47]Just listening to you guys clicking like that so desperately.
[06:00.93]Oh, I got one knife!
[06:01.65]I got one knife!
[06:02.57]Did I win?
[06:02.99]Did I get him?
[06:03.73]Yes!
[06:04.03]Yeah, you did it!
[06:06.69]Yay!
[06:07.31]I win, Shibai!
[06:11.93]Yay, Shibai!
[06:12.49]26 to 22.
[06:12.81]Good score, good score, good score.
[06:17.62]And I have to drink all the alcohol in the house.
[06:19.66]Postable, postable, postable.
[06:21.57]I'm going to take like two shots.
[06:25.44]I'll do one more.
[06:26.26]This is...
