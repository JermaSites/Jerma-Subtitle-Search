[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.72]Why hello?
[00:04.13]Good afternoon, good evening.
[00:06.19]Everybody, good morning for some of you probably.
[00:12.75]I am Jeremy.
[00:15.72]Jeremy D. Elbertson.
[00:19.46]The D is for Daniel.
[00:27.29]We are going to play Kenshi again.
[00:30.81]But a few things have come up that need to be addressed.
[00:37.31]That are very important.
[00:39.10]And just came up with the idea two or three hours ago.
[00:45.56]So it's going to take a little bit of planning.
[00:47.24]It's going to take some time on my part and on your... You guys aren't in... Nobody's in trouble.
[00:53.18]What?
[00:56.12]Why does everybody think they're in trouble?
[00:57.94]No.
[00:59.12]It's about New Year's Eve.
[01:01.92]So... Before... Well, well, you know, hold on.
[01:05.66]Just give me a second.
[01:06.26]Let me just open my soda off camera.
[01:09.30]Because I don't want to blow out everybody's ears.
[01:12.28]So let's just open that up right... Alright, got it open.
[01:20.03]Put it in your sippy cup.
[01:21.47]No, this is... I can drink out of a soda.
[01:22.89]A soda is a giant sippy cup.
[01:26.04]Well, I mean, it's a regular size sippy cup, but it's just a... it's a sippy cup already.
[01:30.34]It has one small hole to enter and exit.
[01:34.14]It's not a giant empty void at the top of a cup.
[01:40.62]Anywho.
[01:42.40]I'm gonna wait till people get here.
[01:44.54]Because this is the last second thing that I want to do for New Year's Eve.
[01:49.12]Long story short before we really get into the meat there.
[01:54.01]I have the studio for New Year's Eve.
[01:55.29]I'm going to do a New Year's Eve award show.
[01:59.13]Based on the worst moments of the last 12 months.
[02:03.77]So, you guys are going to be nominating, and I'm talking very quickly.
[02:09.49]Not yet, though.
[02:10.05]Not yet.
[02:10.79]We'll go over it.
[02:12.05]I'm going over this in real time.
[02:14.41]Because this shit just came up, like I said, a couple hours ago.
[02:19.13]So, there will be categories to nominate some of the worst moments of the year.
[02:24.75]We're talking worst joke, worst overall stream, worst hair on stream, worst noise, best use of cardboard.
[02:34.44]You know, there's got to be a couple best of categories.
[02:42.92]Worst gaming stream?
[02:44.82]Like, I want to get all of them.
[02:47.80]There'll be probably 10 or so, maybe 15 categories.
[02:51.22]And we're going to do an awards ceremony on New Year's Eve to count down the New Year.
[02:59.60]Why not make all best?
[03:01.16]Because that's... We already talked about this last night.
[03:11.02]I have best streamer and I'm not even on the list.
[03:14.86]No, but how this is gonna work is the channel is currently locked.
[03:25.21]I'm eight hours behind you for midnight.
[03:26.93]It's 8 a.m.
[03:28.05]Well, there's nothing I can do about that.
[03:30.89]I'm not, I'm not Atlas.
[03:32.21]I can't like spin, and I'm not talking about the video game.
[03:34.83]I'm talking about like the guy that holds the Earth.
[03:40.40]So, let's just wait for people to get here.
[03:43.62]I got the game set up already.
[03:44.94]We're going to play Kenshi again.
[03:45.88]We got the frog friends.
[03:49.10]But we're really only going to have... You're going to have one day to nominate stuff.
[03:53.76]Because I'm going to give you all the categories here.
[03:56.01]We're going to write them out on stream a little bit later.
[03:59.43]Then you're going to have a day or so to nominate in a Discord channel that's separate.
[04:04.75]Same thing that's going to happen with the Christmas stream.
[04:09.19]Oh!
[04:09.39]Oh!
[04:10.41]And then I'm kind of torn on how the voting is going to work.
[04:14.41]Because I'm not going to stream for the next two days to get this all ready.
[04:18.64]So the voting is probably going to be for one day only.
[04:23.78]You got to make sure you get your vote in.
[04:28.54]But regardless, we will, once we get about halfway through here.
[04:36.01]It's a Coca-Cola classic is what it is.
[04:39.47]Hey, look, it's Kenshi.
[04:40.55]This is exactly where we left off last night.
[04:49.41]Can you wait four hours so I can watch the VOD?
[04:51.95]No, just... Just put it on x10 speed.
[04:56.87]And then add subtitles.
[05:01.98]I haven't regret... No, I mean, I just stopped it last night.
[05:06.04]So let's get in here.
[05:08.00]I haven't paused.
[05:08.82]If you missed the last stream, we ended up with these three.
[05:16.83]Thick up top, thick on the bottom.
[05:20.07]And the dog that is no longer starving to death.
[05:24.37]Just a little malnourished.
[05:28.94]So not bad.
[05:29.66]I still have $1,600.
[05:30.86]What do I have for food?
[05:33.76]I have some decent food here.
[05:37.69]Name the squad.
[05:39.33]Oh yeah, the frog, uh... How do I name them?
[05:44.69]Can you name the squad?
[05:49.65]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[05:50.79]They look like they could survive in a crash.
[05:53.42]What was that guy?
[05:54.16]That weird guy, the crash test dummy thing?
[06:06.34]But anywho, here they are.
[06:08.58]So the last thing that we were doing... Click on SQD.
[06:15.37]Oh, here we go.
[06:18.19]So let's go with, um... Does everybody have to be, like, a little frog?
[06:28.83]Right now they're just frog and dog.
[06:34.93]Well, frogs and dogs.
[06:37.65]I'll get another dog.
[06:40.77]3 out of 20.
[06:46.54]Great Canadian just came in with 10 community subs right off the bat, right now.
[06:52.98]Thank you so much.
[06:54.84]10 community subscriptions.
[07:00.28]Nice.
[07:02.09]I haven't even pressed unpause yet.
[07:04.73]But anyway, so we're together.
[07:06.19]I did a little bit of research.
[07:08.35]I read some things about athleticism.
[07:14.09]Athletics is just run speed.
[07:16.15]So that doesn't mean anything else, I don't think.
[07:18.85]I looked up some stuff about attack, defense, strength, how to strength train and all that stuff.
[07:23.06]So I know a little bit more.
[07:25.48]So I need to go.
[07:27.58]into a building that has a training dummies.
[07:33.01]And I'm not sure where they are here.
[07:38.42]Now, I gotta get out of here.
[07:40.92]No, but hey, hold on a second.
[07:44.32]My mind's running a mile a minute right now because this whole New Year's Eve thing has to happen real quick.
[07:50.96]And I've got to put a lot of time into it over the next couple of days.
[07:53.66]So, I will explain the title in full detail.
[07:57.37]We're going to go over that soon.
[07:59.19]This stream, I'm sorry this stream is not going to be like eight plus hours like I thought it was going to be.
[08:04.93]It's going to be cut short to like...
[08:07.75]I don't know, maybe four or five.
[08:09.91]Because I have to do a bunch of work.
[08:12.33]And we got to get the nominations in.
[08:13.73]Because I got the studio.
[08:14.79]It's confirmed.
[08:15.43]I'm in studio on New Year's Eve.
[08:17.13]I got the confirmation already.
[08:20.87]So.
[08:24.53]Right now my brain is like, what about those categories?
[08:28.92]And no, we're not into the stream.
[08:30.08]I'm going to go for like a good four hours.
[08:31.66]And then we'll talk, okay?
[08:35.68]So, let's go train.
[08:40.01]Jerma, you forgot about something.
[08:41.16]Oh, are you sure about that?
[08:42.40]I don't think I did!
[08:58.15]You think I forgot about this?
[08:59.25]Alright, let's go train.
[09:02.45]We need to find... What do we need to find here?
[09:07.59]I gotta find training dummies in this town, and... It said look for a dome.
[09:12.48]Look for the dome building.
[09:14.68]Every major town has one and has training facilities upstairs.
[09:18.44]I mean, this is a dome building, right?
[09:20.88]Let's just go in here.
[09:26.05]Facecam has a bonus character?
[09:30.99]What city am I in right now?
[09:33.31]I am currently in... This is World's End, I believe.
[09:38.71]No, this is Blister Hill.
[09:42.08]Pump up the base?
[09:44.96]You sure you want me to do that?
[09:47.20]Put on face cam.
[09:49.44]But what if I don't want to?
[09:51.90]Where is this camera anyways?
[09:52.94]I don't even know.
[09:58.37]Here, I'll turn it up.
[10:00.05]Here, I'll give you a little boost of audio.
[10:02.49]Where do you want the cam?
[10:03.69]I don't want to put the cam on.
[10:06.93]Where should I put it?
[10:08.09]Where even is it?
[10:08.61]I got clothes on, right?
[10:10.95]Yeah.
[10:13.86]It's in, like, a weird... It's too, like, far that way.
[10:16.30]You know what I mean?
[10:16.94]You're getting, like, the side profile.
[10:20.12]What kind of, like... What kind of face cam is this?
[10:24.39]I'm, like, clearly looking just straight ahead.
[10:27.73]Don't I need to be, like, in the gamer zone where, like, you can tell I'm looking at the game?
[10:37.44]I feel like I should be on the front of a Gorillaz album.
[10:41.16]No, it's going off.
[10:44.82]Let's go train.
[10:53.15]Uh, up one floor.
[10:54.96]Are there training dummies in here?
[10:56.62]No, they're not training dummies in there.
[11:01.02]Training dummies.
[11:01.92]Looking for training dummies.
[11:02.90]I saw them before, didn't I?
[11:05.08]Fuck.
[11:07.54]What do they look like?
[11:10.92]I thought they were training dummies.
[11:13.35]Fuck.
[11:15.51]Training dummy?
[11:16.19]No.
[11:25.21]I need to do this before I leave.
[11:30.07]Just buy a house and put a dummy in it.
[11:33.32]Does this town not have a training dummy?
[11:36.40]I thought we saw it before.
[11:38.14]Just hit people instead.
[11:39.48]No, I can't.
[11:42.42]Fuck.
[11:47.38]They look like stick people.
[11:48.62]Yeah, I... From like base or barracks or something, maybe?
[11:57.91]You're not gonna let me look in here?
[11:58.85]I don't know.
[12:08.30]Outside the walls?
[12:11.72]Are there some outside the walls?
[12:14.14]Are you sure about that?
[12:17.90]Outside walls.
[12:24.93]You see any?
[12:27.66]I gotta find him.
[12:28.32]I can't really leave.
[12:29.95]Outside walls.
[12:31.25]Outside walls.
[12:35.79]Fuck.
[12:38.45]Check the garage.
[12:41.69]I would think that maybe down here?
[12:46.24]Right there, dude?
[12:49.18]It's right there, dude?
[12:50.20]Where?
[12:51.30]I'm getting a lot of, right there, dude!
[12:52.86]And I'm like, where is that?
[12:57.64]Did I build this?
[12:58.34]Yes.
[12:58.72]This is my first city.
[13:00.12]Spent about two days making it.
[13:02.66]That building.
[13:03.40]That building.
[13:04.09]That building.
[13:04.67]This building.
[13:05.63]Like, this building?
[13:07.65]Right there, dude?
[13:12.61]This is public.
[13:16.18]No, the other one.
[13:19.72]Not there.
[13:22.02]Bars aren't for- Yeah, this is a bar.
[13:28.68]From my understanding, they look like they're on top.
[13:32.04]Maybe there's just not training dummies in this town or something.
[13:37.86]Click on the map.
[13:40.42]I mean, it should be here, right?
[13:47.24]In the second gate, the building to the right is the barracks.
[13:52.30]Oh, yeah!
[13:53.56]Alright, so...
[13:58.87]Am I allowed in here?
[13:59.75]This is open to the public.
[14:01.03]Let's go.
[14:05.47]I'm allowed to come up here.
[14:10.61]We are allowed up there.
[14:15.70]Where are they?
[14:19.90]How far away is this place?
[14:20.96]Oh, there we go.
[14:21.42]Alright, so we got... We have these training dummies.
[14:25.76]I'm allowed to use these, right?
[14:28.66]So let's go with, uh, Canroth.
[14:32.13]We're gonna train.
[14:33.05]Let's take a look.
[14:34.01]Start training.
[14:34.61]Here we go.
[14:37.21]And you, you are, how are you?
[14:38.89]Are you already trained high enough?
[14:40.13]I think you can only train a certain level on these.
[14:41.59]Maybe not.
[14:44.73]Maybe I should give him the weapon.
[14:51.15]Can I not train the dog?
[14:52.14]No, the dog's just constantly hungry.
[14:55.68]Back away from there.
[14:56.52]What?
[14:56.64]What?
[14:58.69]Are they talking to us?
[15:00.27]That's private equipment.
[15:04.07]What?
[15:04.77]Why?
[15:07.87]Can I get one point before I leave?
[15:14.81]God damn it.
[15:15.71]Come on.
[15:16.07]One point.
[15:17.13]One point and I'll leave.
[15:19.43]Stay away from there.
[15:20.11]That's private equipment.
[15:20.84]One point.
[15:22.24]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[15:23.64]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[15:28.96]You just need one last little bit.
[15:31.64]Come on.
[15:32.96]Okay.
[15:34.74]Okay.
[15:37.06]How did I go down?
[15:39.34]I went down and then in attack.
[15:41.00]Somehow.
[15:46.50]Doesn't that make no sense?
[15:48.96]Wait a minute.
[15:49.42]Hold on.
[15:53.09]Combat.
[15:53.53]Melee attack two.
[15:54.85]See?
[15:55.15]Okay.
[15:55.67]I got... I did it.
[16:00.75]So what is he at now?
[16:02.22]Six?
[16:02.52]Okay, so this is the guy that needs that good weapon.
[16:06.14]Yeah, well that's not a bad weapon, but still.
[16:11.38]So, I need to open up both of their inventories here, so you need to put this away.
[16:15.55]Can I just go like this?
[16:19.07]How do I have both open at the same time?
[16:21.55]Trade?
[16:23.29]Okay, so you need this weapon because you are way better.
[16:27.82]Let's trade.
[16:28.46]Because you're the one that's actually going to be doing damage.
[16:30.68]Let's see.
[16:32.30]Five plus nine... What was it before?
[16:35.20]Six?
[16:35.64]Was it more on the other one?
[16:37.32]Because he had... Hold on a minute.
[16:40.40]So that's nine defense now.
[16:48.32]So what's the problem?
[16:49.12]You can't use this?
[16:49.74]Too heavy for you?
[16:51.59]Ten.
[16:54.45]Attack point is -2, because I can't even use the damn thing.
[16:57.07]Alright, well, whatever.
[16:57.79]He's got ten attack.
[17:03.23]Well, I illegally leveled up my two characters once.
[17:10.08]Alright, so... Let's all go meet up.
[17:13.48]And let's go try to make some money.
[17:19.52]I forgot how good the Spyro soundtrack was.
[17:22.80]Are you coming, dog?
[17:23.46]Let's go.
[17:25.88]Alright, where are we gonna go?
[17:27.76]Let's buy some food.
[17:29.24]Let's get a good supply of actual food.
[17:31.27]I'm gonna save it and we're gonna go on an adventure.
[17:34.75]Set up a bar.
[17:35.33]Where's the closest bar?
[17:41.62]Over here, probably.
[17:43.06]Right here, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17:58.59]A little band of weirdos.
[18:00.19]I love it.
[18:02.11]Alright, let's get in.
[18:06.85]This way.
[18:10.75]Holding alt-highlight?
[18:11.57]Yeah.
[18:13.15]Wait.
[18:13.79]Right on the ground.
[18:14.33]Alright.
[18:15.09]We need to trade.
[18:15.69]Let me see what you got.
[18:18.91]You've got... This is expensive.
[18:21.71]You don't have any more little meat sticks, do you?
[18:24.83]It might be worth buying a few of these because they're very nutritious.
[18:36.17]Carry them both at the same time.
[18:42.58]Carry them both at the same time.
[18:46.54]So I can afford... Three... Three, six, nine, twelve.
[18:51.89]I can afford to buy all three of these.
[18:58.53]Or, no, actually I can afford two.
[19:05.13]But they're very nutritious.
[19:08.60]And that's it, I got 200 bucks.
[19:09.92]I got a backpack already full of food.
[19:13.88]Now as long as one person has, uh, has stuff, they can... Like for instance, I have a bunch of stuff in my backpack.
[19:21.04]This will feed everybody, right?
[19:26.35]I got a backpack full of food.
[19:28.01]So we're good.
[19:29.23]Time for, let's go.
[19:30.89]I'm ready to move.
[19:39.11]No, the dog's good.
[19:40.21]We're good.
[19:41.95]The three of us are ready to go.
[19:43.59]We have weapons.
[19:44.55]We have a giant sack.
[19:49.00]And it's time to go.
[19:50.00]So we're gonna go from here.
[19:53.32]This time, I'm gonna go, we're gonna go downriver.
[19:57.06]And we're going to end up at some point over here.
[20:00.62]I don't know where this is going to bring us, but we're going to go.
[20:04.56]Increase the music.
[20:08.93]No, we're good.
[20:09.25]The music's fine where it is.
[20:11.25]I don't want it to overpower.
[20:12.29]Here we go.
[20:19.07]See you later, suckers.
[20:24.29]Humble beginnings, guys.
[20:27.70]Eventually, they'll all have 30 people in a city.
[20:29.54]Are these bandits, or...?
[20:33.64]No, Holy Nation, that's fine.
[20:34.74]Alright.
[20:39.64]What a perfect RPG party.
[20:42.59]Following right behind each other.
[20:44.01]This is just my voice.
[20:48.11]Are we gonna get a mining stream out of this?
[20:52.51]Uh, it's possible.
[20:57.44]That all depends on, uh, on a few factors.
[20:59.80]Everybody's doing good with food.
[21:03.26]Except, why is it, uh, no, no one's eating.
[21:08.96]Okay.
[21:10.34]Alright, slow it down, slow it down.
[21:11.97]Food, now's our chance.
[21:13.07]Run them through.
[21:13.93]Wait a second.
[21:18.29]Hungry bandit leader.
[21:20.03]Hungry bandit.
[21:22.43]Starving bandits.
[21:23.47]What do they have for, their attack is not that good.
[21:26.43]Four, five, turn around.
[21:35.18]Turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around.
[21:36.72]Go, go, go.
[21:37.34]This way.
[21:37.64]Same way we came.
[21:47.64]Come on, bring them to the gate.
[21:49.24]They're cutting us off.
[21:51.14]I didn't save it.
[21:51.81]I didn't save it.
[21:52.35]I didn't save it.
[21:52.85]I didn't save it.
[21:53.35]I didn't save it.
[21:53.85]We're not fast enough.
[21:55.05]I didn't save it.
[21:57.32]Where's the gate?
[22:00.06]Where?
[22:00.38]Come on, I need... Right here.
[22:04.56]Make it to right here.
[22:06.48]Just run into the fucking town.
[22:12.88]We can make it.
[22:13.73]It's gonna be fine.
[22:15.77]Go!
[22:21.73]Come on!
[22:22.25]26 fucking damage, really?
[22:29.65]Come on, dog!
[22:37.42]Why am I so much faster?
[22:40.08]The dog's gonna get left behind.
[22:41.36]I just fed him.
[22:46.08]Come on, hurry, get to the gate!
[22:49.92]Alright, bring it in!
[22:56.74]No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[22:57.96]Fight the, fight the bandits!
[23:01.63]Just bring him into town, bring him to the Stormwind Guards, quickly!
[23:13.32]What the fuck is happening?
[23:19.30]Alright, let him fight.
[23:20.04]Alright, we're good.
[23:23.72]Let's loot everybody's body.
[23:29.83]Perfect.
[23:31.79]Oh, you got a little bit of armor?
[23:33.11]I'll take it.
[23:35.35]Pants better?
[23:36.36]Not really.
[23:38.90]Thanks for the free stuff, guards.
[23:42.48]Armor... Who doesn't have armor right now?
[23:45.12]We don't.
[23:45.52]These pants... What happened to my pants?
[23:49.00]A little weapon stick.
[23:59.98]What happened to the portrait?
[24:02.94]Alright, that's good.
[24:03.46]We got a little bit of armor out of that.
[24:08.69]They're under arrest.
[24:10.09]How are we doing?
[24:10.59]Okay, um... Head.
[24:13.79]Dog is fine.
[24:15.35]Stomach, right arm.
[24:16.49]I don't need to bandage anything.
[24:17.61]We're fine.
[24:17.93]I don't think it's necessary.
[24:20.37]Actually, right arm.
[24:22.67]Right arm going down.
[24:26.33]I'm gonna need to heal that.
[24:27.11]I don't have a med kit.
[24:30.68]Well, I do.
[24:33.29]First aid.
[24:36.85]There we go.
[24:42.33]Take their weapons.
[24:43.06]They're not dead.
[24:44.68]They're just KO'd.
[24:45.84]Really?
[24:46.14]Okay.
[24:50.86]Well, they're doing a good job.
[24:52.06]Alright, back to what we were doing.
[24:53.00]What were we doing?
[24:53.44]We were going this way.
[24:55.16]Anybody else losing blood?
[24:57.00]No.
[24:58.35]We're all safe.
[24:59.71]Let me F5 it here.
[25:04.12]Wait, hold on, can I?
[25:13.41]Uh, that just crashed the game.
[25:14.50]Thank God I pressed F5.
[25:20.66]Thank God I pressed that button.
[25:28.78]Lorag just gave $50 right now.
[25:30.56]Thank you, Lorag.
[25:31.34]Hope yourself and everyone in chat enjoyed the holiday season.
[25:33.72]Wish you guys nothing but the best in 2019.
[25:35.78]Thank you.
[25:36.82]Thank you so much for $50, Lorag.
[25:38.50]$50.
[25:45.03]Hope you had a great holiday season as well.
[25:51.21]Again, if you come in and you don't know what the title means, New Year's Eve,
[25:58.73]In a little bit, we are going to go over the whole thing again.
[26:02.23]I just want to make sure people weren't confused.
[26:06.45]Thank God I did that.
[26:07.47]Also, the music is the Spyro 2 official soundtrack.
[26:22.72]But yeah, Lorag, you've given a shitload of money.
[26:27.38]So, thank you so much.
[26:30.38]But, yes.
[26:33.60]I'm going to have to talk about it a handful of times on stream.
[26:37.80]No, no, no.
[26:38.26]I was going to do that.
[26:39.05]Hey.
[26:40.69]Whatever.
[26:41.05]Let's go.
[26:41.41]It's okay.
[26:45.07]Continue what we were doing before this way.
[26:47.19]Oh, there's going to be an award ceremony on New Year's Eve.
[26:52.54]Yeah, I'm going to be in the studio again.
[26:55.94]So, should be a lot of fun.
[26:58.70]I'm gonna, we'll talk about categories in a few hours.
[27:04.12]And the nomination process.
[27:05.76]And then there'll be a, essentially like a 12 hour voting period.
[27:10.13]Tomorrow.
[27:17.70]Awards for worst moments of 2018 on stream.
[27:22.08]So we're talking worst stream in 2018, worst joke, worst hair, uh, worst brand of soda, worst, uh, worst joke, worst joke that took more than five minutes to make.
[27:34.72]It's gonna be about 10 categories.
[27:39.60]There might even be more than that.
[27:46.62]There'll be maybe a couple of best dubs, but I really want to highlight the worst of the year.
[28:03.28]And then I'm going to present them.
[28:05.36]And each one of the categories is going to get its own nominee video clips.
[28:10.02]And I've got... I already did the Amazon order.
[28:12.46]I'm going to have a podium.
[28:13.08]I'm going to be in a suit.
[28:13.84]There's going to be one in front of the green screen.
[28:16.56]There's going to be a presentation for each one.
[28:24.70]So, we're going to go... Because this was sold last second... Let me just make sure I'm safe to talk about this for a minute.
[28:31.81]Yeah, I am.
[28:32.55]Save it right here.
[28:34.72]Is there ore right here?
[28:36.44]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[28:37.52]Hold on!
[28:37.94]That's a... What is this?
[28:38.82]That's huge!
[28:41.14]No, wait.
[28:41.48]Frogmoss.
[28:41.90]Get over here.
[28:42.46]Look at how big this is!
[28:43.99]What is this?
[28:45.55]Iron?
[28:47.83]No faction.
[28:48.55]No workers.
[28:51.05]That's huge.
[28:51.57]That is a massive iron vein.
[28:53.77]That's 100% quality.
[29:00.32]They can both do it at the same time.
[29:04.03]How many people can you have?
[29:05.03]Three people at a time can work on this.
[29:06.85]Let's do it.
[29:13.03]Just get a few of them, right?
[29:13.89]Just so I can make sure I have enough money?
[29:20.83]Give me one minute.
[29:21.33]Give me a minute.
[29:22.25]I'm going to put it into... No, I'm going to put it in my backpack.
[29:26.99]Because I'm the strong one.
[29:39.91]I don't think I should fill the backpack though.
[29:47.07]Have frog carry Massimo in so he gets... This dog is not gonna be able to ever walk.
[30:02.21]May as well fill all of them to try and spring.
[30:07.15]Yeah, how we doing on food?
[30:08.07]We're good.
[30:08.45]Everybody's fed.
[30:09.23]We're good.
[30:09.89]Just gotta get to another town.
[30:10.81]It's all about consistently staying healthy.
[30:16.59]Wow, the whole keg gives up five community subs.
[30:20.48]Thank you, whole keg.
[30:23.84]Five more community subs.
[30:27.90]Sweet.
[30:29.14]Very, very, very kind of you.
[30:30.24]Thank you.
[30:38.60]But I'm so scared to walk around over encumbered.
[30:42.36]Because when you do that, if somebody gets the jump on you, we're just gonna die out there.
[30:49.92]He's building, uh, worker strength, right?
[30:52.08]Yep.
[30:53.70]Should be.
[31:00.46]You're gonna die either way.
[31:01.98]Not with that attitude.
[31:05.28]Can you buy a horse or something?
[31:06.76]I don't know, I'm not sure.
[31:09.08]I really don't know what this game has to offer.
[31:17.37]You can sneak while mining without a downside.
[31:20.65]To get sneak points?
[31:24.98]How do you sneakily mine?
[31:42.09]Tap the whole vein?
[31:43.37]Uh, that'll take all day.
[31:44.31]Alright, that's- okay, I'm gonna fill up his inventory with, uh, rocks.
[31:48.31]So he can walk slower.
[31:49.55]Holy shit.
[31:52.09]Squirds just gave out 10 community subs.
[32:00.44]That's, like, at least 30.
[32:01.88]20, 30, 40 or something community subs.
[32:04.62]In the first 25 minutes, 30 minutes of the stream.
[32:07.19]Thank you guys so much.
[32:12.11]What, he ate cookies?
[32:12.93]I don't even- when did I get cookies?
[32:14.29]Assign people jobs to stay together?
[32:21.68]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[32:28.14]So, a significant portion of this stream will be getting all the categories set and giving all the rules for nominating and voting and everything.
[32:35.90]Holy shit, thank you, uh, Lake Drinker for five community subs.
[32:40.94]Thank you, AnonymousGifter, for five community subs.
[32:46.22]This is the high quality content!
[32:48.16]This is why everyone's giving so many subs!
[32:50.30]Watching me mine a iron vein.
[32:54.07]Thank you for that.
[32:59.91]Really though, guys, thank you.
[33:02.94]He's way over in comfort.
[33:04.22]This is it.
[33:04.72]We're out of here after this.
[33:11.45]That's good for now.
[33:12.83]Let's give you guys some jobs.
[33:14.89]Everyone's over-encumbered, right?
[33:17.11]They should be struggling to move.
[33:18.47]No, they're sneaking.
[33:20.49]Well, actually, if I sneak, doesn't that just build?
[33:23.66]Sneaking?
[33:24.90]It does, right?
[33:25.44]Hold on.
[33:27.10]If we just all sneak together.
[33:30.94]Stealth.
[33:35.55]Alright, so hold on.
[33:36.75]So, we have a shitload of weight down, so we're building strength.
[33:42.25]We have sneaking, so we're building stealth.
[33:47.00]Right?
[33:47.96]Yeah.
[33:50.86]Now that's a fucking 900 IQ play right there.
[33:56.43]It's probably like what you're supposed to do.
[33:57.89]So I'm just going to sneak all the way to the next town.
[34:04.16]Let's get a quick save here.
[34:07.04]Alright, let me get a good look at the map.
[34:08.66]Because I want to make sure nothing crazy is going to happen.
[34:10.86]So, I'm going to stay on the road.
[34:11.94]There's no reason to go off-road.
[34:15.43]Although, there might be for whatever is over here.
[34:18.87]What is this?
[34:22.51]It's a vein.
[34:23.35]What is it?
[34:23.71]A copper vein?
[34:24.35]I don't know.
[34:26.92]Now, stay on course.
[34:27.84]Build up stats.
[34:29.84]Sneak all the way to the next town on x10 speed.
[34:34.36]Bet three with five community subs.
[34:37.95]Thank you so much for the fucking subs.
[34:42.49]Well, let's stay the course.
[34:46.20]Ahem, hack.
[34:48.32]What?
[34:50.08]What's wrong?
[34:52.78]Is he alright?
[34:58.26]Harm on throw, harm on throw, she lived a life of anguish.
[35:03.39]Oh, he's about to sing!
[35:04.85]For chained in rebirth, she was condemned to languish.
[35:12.13]Till one day she'd been ravaged by the high paladin, most vile.
[35:17.87]The fuck?
[35:21.35]And she swore her dark vengeance with a murderous smile.
[35:28.20]Where the fuck did you get this song?
[35:32.06]She stashed a long nail forged to blade, great- oh my lord.
[35:37.75]GreatCanadianFuckClub, 20 community subs, 5 community- 5 community subs from Maxie Kaspersky.
[35:44.83]She killed all the guards, uh, Gra- That- What the fuck?!
[35:47.69]Who just gave 50- Somebody just gave 50 community subs!
[35:50.54]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[35:51.90]This is happening too fast!
[35:53.96]What happened?
[35:54.42]Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[35:56.42]Who's looking at us?
[36:02.86]Who's looking at us?
[36:04.92]Uh... I don't understand who's staring at us.
[36:11.99]I'm panicking right now.
[36:13.09]Okay.
[36:14.05]Alright.
[36:14.43]Alright.
[36:14.73]Wait, wait, wait.
[36:15.35]This is, uh, I gotta say, I gotta look at this for a second because what on Earth is going on?
[36:22.19]Did, did somebody just give Maxi Kaspersky five, great Canadian fuck club, 20, Tora T 50.
[36:34.18]And then what is it?
[36:35.56]A hundred or 50, 50.
[36:45.37]Wow.
[36:47.61]Uh, Tora.
[36:50.30]You guys are... You guys are out of control right now.
[36:52.88]Thank you.
[36:53.26]Rampaging Scruff of 5.
[36:54.44]Tora, 50 community subs.
[36:57.30]That's... That's, what, 250 bucks?
[36:59.12]You just spent $250 right now.
[37:08.27]Holy shit, guys.
[37:09.03]So remember I said the F word?
[37:12.25]I'm sorry.
[37:16.66]My goodness.
[37:17.86]I did not expect that today at all.
[37:20.58]I never expect it.
[37:22.91]But... I appreciate it, guys.
[37:26.23]Thank you.
[37:26.97]And if you got a community sub, awesome.
[37:32.47]Thanks a lot, guys.
[37:34.69]But the real question is... What is looking at me right now?
[37:40.06]Is there something here?
[37:41.06]I don't know what I'm looking at.
[37:44.62]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[37:48.06]It's a dog.
[37:50.50]Bone dog.
[37:51.28]Can I... Goal is attacking others.
[37:58.44]14 attack and 12 strength.
[38:01.38]Why are you so good?
[38:03.66]What?
[38:05.18]He's gonna kill us all.
[38:07.20]This thing's gonna kill us alright now.
[38:11.22]Is there like something I can do?
[38:12.61]Oh my god, this is bad.
[38:18.07]We're all over encumbered.
[38:20.63]Wait, hold on.
[38:21.17]6 plus 4 minus 11 and 5.
[38:27.73]Versus, what's the defense on you?
[38:29.07]What do you got for defense?
[38:33.70]Dexterity, toughness, 14.
[38:36.54]Strength, 12.
[38:39.14]Should we try to kill it?
[38:41.60]I think we have to run.
[38:42.70]But nobody can run.
[38:43.66]Alright, stop sneaking everybody.
[38:49.80]Um... Do I have to drop everything and run?
[38:55.48]I think I do.
[38:58.35]Drop all the ore on the ground?
[39:04.89]Drop everything and fight.
[39:07.21]Fine.
[39:19.71]Okay.
[39:25.67]Okay.
[39:26.01]You ready?
[39:31.55]Drop the backpack!
[39:33.61]The backpack has so many vital things and I can't drop the backpack.
[39:40.03]Drop the backpack!
[39:41.23]This is too much important stuff!
[39:48.48]Oh my god, but what if, what, I don't know.
[39:52.78]Okay.
[39:54.58]I'm at -2.
[39:56.86]Five.
[39:57.89]Let's go.
[39:58.25]I think I'm ready.
[39:59.21]Get everybody selected here.
[40:02.29]Let's take on the dog.
[40:03.23]I'm ready.
[40:07.07]So make sure everyone, we got everybody here.
[40:08.63]Everyone's selected.
[40:16.45]Alright.
[40:17.75]Attack target.
[40:21.05]Are we ready?
[40:21.53]Okay, here we go.
[40:25.93]Frog not selected.
[40:27.09]Oh, shit.
[40:29.31]Why is the frog not selected?
[40:32.38]Oh, because you're all the way back here.
[40:33.38]What the hell are you doing back there?
[40:36.04]Alright, nobody's sneaking.
[40:37.26]Here we go.
[40:37.76]Attack target.
[40:42.48]Three, two, one, action.
[40:50.05]Get him!
[40:55.45]Hit him!
[40:55.87]Somebody hit him!
[40:58.71]He's so much bigger than my dog!
[41:00.53]Somebody hit the fucking dog!
[41:04.31]Get him!
[41:05.97]Nice.
[41:06.33]Okay.
[41:06.77]What's his health at?
[41:08.28]He's almost dead.
[41:09.22]Left leg.
[41:09.86]Cut his leg off.
[41:10.40]Cut his leg off.
[41:11.20]Cut his leg off!
[41:12.52]Well, he's distracted!
[41:18.88]Get it!
[41:21.16]Do it!
[41:22.10]Kill him!
[41:22.66]Is he dead?
[41:30.44]There's no winner in this battle.
[41:47.43]What do you mean I don't have a med kit?
[41:50.36]How do you not have a med kit?
[41:51.54]What?
[42:05.06]Oh, for the love of fucking God, everything's in the backpack.
[42:11.76]Is anybody still alive?
[42:21.88]Dying.
[42:22.54]Dying.
[42:23.36]Dying.
[42:26.84]The character's unconscious.
[42:27.94]The character's unconscious.
[42:38.00]How far away is that?
[42:40.30]That was ten minutes ago?
[42:45.27]What do you mean no scumming?
[42:55.65]I have to scum this.
[42:59.49]That was right when I was about to get on the road.
[43:07.53]Welcome to Kenshi.
[43:08.77]Welcome to the stream.
[43:10.91]Yeah.
[43:13.42]We're fine.
[43:14.12]We're fine.
[43:14.52]Look at this.
[43:14.98]We're back here.
[43:17.02]Same deal.
[43:17.66]Everything's good to go.
[43:18.96]I'm sneaking.
[43:19.94]Building power.
[43:21.88]This time, that dog's not gonna be here.
[43:34.19]Because it happened right here.
[43:36.63]So I didn't lose any time at all.
[43:38.15]Because that was... There was a shitload of community subs and I stopped.
[43:42.23]Yeah, we're good.
[43:42.93]We're fine.
[43:44.11]We're good to go.
[43:47.18]Dog is fine.
[43:47.86]Everyone's nice and fed.
[43:48.94]Everyone's happy.
[43:53.74]Discovered Holy Farm.
[43:54.98]Alright, let's take a look.
[43:57.24]There's one here.
[43:57.98]Holy Mines and Holy Farm.
[44:01.04]Let's pay a visit to the Holy Farm.
[44:07.95]I'm gonna save it right... Hold on.
[44:10.49]Make sure there's nothing here, right?
[44:11.55]Because if I save it here... We're good.
[44:15.51]Save it.
[44:19.52]Aren't you wanted at the Holy Farm?
[44:21.72]I'm sure we'll find out.
[44:29.78]I don't see any enemies or anything.
[44:31.54]Alright, what's the next OST?
[44:41.33]To be fair, I'm on day 100-something.
[44:43.75]I have about 20 people.
[44:49.31]Tony Hawk.
[44:52.13]You want to put on the Tony Hawk OST?
[44:54.15]I'm going to get the whole channel... This is going to get shut off.
[45:06.82]Too late.
[45:14.55]Yeah, rip, uh, rip Vaude.
[45:26.69]No, I'm not gonna put on the Tony Hawk soundtrack.
[45:29.57]Alright, how about, um... Just play it at, like, x2 speed and pitch it down.
[45:35.41]Just dodge the filter.
[45:47.16]I thought somebody said Starbucks.
[45:48.86]I thought you said Starbucks.
[45:50.46]I was like, Starbucks does not have an OST.
[45:53.66]The Starbucks OST is... Like... Now that's what I call music volume 8.
[46:08.62]Put on Sneak King OST.
[46:11.04]Oh, that's the Burger King game.
[46:14.77]Who the hell would upload the Sneak King OST?
[46:19.34]Do you sit in your chair and you're like, you know what?
[46:22.78]I think I'm going to upload the Sneak King album today.
[46:24.96]No.
[46:26.16]It doesn't exist.
[46:38.78]It doesn't exist.
[46:39.66]Yeah, I did Animal Crossing before.
[46:49.49]Simpsons Hit and Run.
[46:50.79]Alright, I'm just gonna pick one.
[46:52.49]Let's go Starbound.
[46:53.63]Starbound OST.
[46:54.69]This is six and a half hours?
[47:04.64]This is six hours and forty minutes of music in Starbound?
[47:07.58]What the fuck?
[47:08.98]Holy God.
[47:09.90]Alright, here we go.
[47:17.94]We've saved it.
[47:23.86]Holy military base.
[47:25.32]Alright.
[47:31.47]I need to train.
[47:32.43]I need to get my characters leveled up.
[47:34.27]They're so shitty.
[47:41.17]Holy military base is here.
[47:42.43]Holy farm.
[47:45.33]Was I here before?
[47:46.37]No, I wasn't here before, was I?
[47:48.49]I was over at that one, wasn't it?
[47:50.61]Wait, what's wrong?
[47:51.39]What's going on here?
[48:01.31]I don't get it.
[48:05.44]Heal yourself?
[48:07.96]I'm okay.
[48:14.59]Should I... I mean, if I'm at 93, 91, that's... My left egg is banishing.
[48:18.47]It's not urgent.
[48:24.59]Okay.
[48:30.56]This is so dumb.
[48:33.32]Sneaking everywhere.
[48:34.55]Why do I have a pelican mouth?
[48:39.31]It's red.
[48:39.73]You're bleeding.
[48:40.27]Alright, well.
[48:44.23]First aid.
[48:48.57]Wolf den 657 has been wiped out.
[48:56.01]Wolf den.
[48:56.71]What does that mean?
[48:57.27]That keeps popping up.
[49:01.96]We can stop sneaking now.
[49:02.84]Let's just walk.
[49:04.62]I still have all the ore, right?
[49:05.88]Yep.
[49:07.06]Somebody here want to buy it off me?
[49:11.92]Can we all go to the bathroom at the same time?
[49:23.17]I mean, did I just hear shit noises?
[49:25.17]I think I actually did hear that.
[49:30.67]Did I?
[49:30.95]Did I?
[49:32.88]Am I making that up in my head?
[49:40.66]Hold on a minute.
[50:14.19]Did I make it up?
[50:19.88]Is he going to the... I thought he was doing it too.
[50:21.62]That's just the way he stands.
[50:23.82]I might be just... My brain might have just been making it up for some reason.
[50:29.50]Alright, I need to get these guys' jobs to follow... Follow me.
[50:37.23]Follow the job.
[50:39.21]Alright, let's just shift-click.
[50:43.13]You stay close to me.
[50:44.59]You also stay close to me.
[50:50.40]And also, bodyguard.
[50:53.42]Staying... Okay, I'll get rid of that.
[50:54.66]Staying close, bodyguard.
[50:55.88]Staying close, bodyguard.
[50:59.14]That works.
[51:02.55]Let the dog go to the bathroom.
[51:03.65]The dog doesn't need to use an outhouse.
[51:06.43]Let's go back to...
[51:09.20]No reason for the music, because obviously there is none right now.
[51:20.77]What is this music?
[51:21.99]Uh, Starbound OST.
[51:23.25]That was a good one.
[51:46.08]Alright, let's go in here.
[51:52.64]Uh, public building.
[51:53.64]For sale?
[51:54.56]Whoa, whoa.
[51:55.38]This building's for sale.
[51:56.41]Some buildings are available for purchase.
[51:58.47]This pin will tell you how much the building costs.
[52:01.11]I could buy this for 12,800 C's?
[52:02.77]You can also often buy destroyed buildings for a cheaper rate.
[52:07.63]You must repair the building before it can be used.
[52:11.40]Really?
[52:11.68]Really?
[52:15.09]That's kinda cool.
[52:19.31]Play at .5 speed.
[52:22.11]Can I steal this?
[52:28.98]Alright, well this is- I can buy this building.
[52:32.92]What about in here?
[52:33.58]This is a public building as well.
[52:36.30]Holding Alt.
[52:38.48]Who is running this place?
[52:40.20]Oh, this person up here.
[53:22.37]I can't do that, man.
[53:23.65]I'm sorry.
[53:24.15]I can't handle that.
[53:26.05]That was funny for five seconds.
[53:31.27]I need some good ambient... Like, Lord of the Rings music is going to get this channel turned off.
[53:38.36]What about, like... Okay, Lord of the Rings royalty-free music.
[53:45.42]Did somebody make a version that's royalty free?
[53:56.93]Just do Skyrim.
[53:57.83]Hold on.
[53:58.21]Lord of the Rings mix.
[54:01.30]Let's put this one on.
[54:09.22]Alright, that sounds okay.
[54:14.17]Look at a trade.
[54:16.81]Let's see.
[54:19.49]No, this is not Lord of the Rings.
[54:20.59]This is a fake Lord of the Rings soundtrack.
[54:22.37]Okay, sell price.
[54:26.88]Sell it all.
[54:28.42]Get some money.
[54:32.92]And... Change over to you.
[54:34.89]You got lots of stuff in your backpack.
[54:44.42]Speaking of backpacks, I wonder if I should buy another one.
[54:50.09]This is designed to fit a bowl.
[54:52.37]You got raw meat?
[54:53.51]Oh, I will take that raw meat.
[54:58.25]Cotton.
[55:00.47]What am I going to do with that?
[55:05.65]Arrange that again.
[55:06.31]I got some more food.
[55:07.57]I need to kind of get in a major town here.
[55:18.96]He's... Is he still mining iron and not... Oh, it's... Yeah, hold on.
[55:24.32]Let me fix it.
[55:26.94]No, that's... Hold on, that's times two.
[55:39.53]Normal.
[55:42.90]There we go.
[55:43.50]This is not Lord of the Rings.
[55:52.36]Alright.
[55:54.56]So that's all I can really do here.
[55:55.72]I do have some money.
[55:58.80]I don't, what about, I can buy animals from this guy?
[56:02.64]Talk to.
[56:04.58]Uh, got any animals for sale?
[56:06.86]Oh, would you look at that?
[56:10.04]What is this thing?
[56:11.71]Look at this, this attack on the, I got, what, 9,000?
[56:20.21]That was so good.
[56:24.43]13 strength 9 melee attack I only have 1600 bucks.
[56:30.50]Can I buy like a baby cow?
[56:35.44]Damn it Anybody else want to join me on my journey?
[56:46.96]I can't talk to you
[56:58.11]No, you just, like... You just get out of the way and stay out of sight.
[57:07.67]Holy shit, what's in here?
[57:12.16]Oh, not worth it.
[57:19.86]Oh, there's a backpack.
[57:21.83]Bread.
[57:23.23]Oh, I didn't pay attention to the... I just figured it was...
[57:29.89]I keep forgetting that when you open up a... When you open up a box, there's a chance to steal.
[57:36.79]When it's on a table, there is no chance.
[57:38.79]You just take it.
[57:42.27]Whatever.
[57:43.55]I really do want this, though.
[57:44.79]Oh, fuck.
[57:48.38]God damn it.
[57:49.24]I keep forgetting that.
[57:51.94]Simpsons Hit and Run OST.
[58:04.10]I think that's all I can do.
[58:10.70]I sold everything.
[58:11.38]What is this doing in here?
[58:35.43]Wait, stay together, stay together.
[58:37.01]What's wrong with you?
[58:40.87]Why can't you run this?
[58:41.85]Alright, no more Simpsons songs, okay?
[58:51.83]I need something ambient, not like TV show theme songs blasting in my fucking ear.
[59:00.47]That's just a McDonald's theme song, guys.
[59:02.27]Where do you think they got it from?
[59:07.25]Slow it down.
[59:28.05]Halo OST.
[59:32.55]McDonald's OST.
[59:36.70]Alright, let's go.
[59:45.49]I sold all my shit.
[59:47.45]We need to move down here.
[59:50.56]Almost to this river.
[59:51.76]Go through the purple zone, maybe.
[59:53.04]Let's go, boys.
[60:03.17]I'm loving it.
[60:04.07]The Simpsons.
[60:05.35]Alrighty then.
[60:06.19]This is just Ace Ventura.
[60:43.92]Did you say Boomer Show?
[60:45.84]Ace Ventura is a movie starring Jim Carrey.
[60:49.86]And it is a classic.
[60:55.34]Oh, there's an outpost here.
[60:56.48]I feel like I should build a little town, or at least a shack.
[61:04.07]What is that, though?
[61:04.89]Hold on.
[61:07.79]What is this?
[61:13.06]Is there a campfire over there?
[61:14.16]No.
[61:17.07]I saw a fly flew up by now, so I'll just get a grip.
[61:24.17]Alright, there is... ...a small copper resource.
[61:27.73]That's worth a lot of money.
[61:34.07]There's a sandstorm.
[61:42.02]Let's get some copper.
[61:45.83]Because this one's 80, so don't mind the one back there.
[61:52.39]Same thing.
[61:53.79]Line it up.
[61:54.37]Sell it in town.
[61:57.11]Train.
[62:01.15]Both work together on this, please.
[62:04.29]Excuse me.
[62:05.11]Work together on this, please.
[62:09.68]Excuse me.
[62:12.42]Is there a reason why you're not working on this, please?
[62:18.77]Only one work is allowed on here.
[62:20.37]Oh, god damn it.
[62:23.21]Really?
[62:28.46]Laboring 37.
[62:28.98]What do you have for laboring stat?
[62:36.90]9.
[62:37.93]Versus 37.
[62:38.51]Yeah, you're going to be the one doing it.
[62:41.01]Send the other guy back and forth to sell stuff.
[62:52.90]Alright, that's a good soundtrack, but I don't want to hear it anymore.
[63:22.15]Is this gonna do anything?
[63:29.75]This is a silent video.
[63:32.04]This is a screamer.
[63:32.74]Okay, that video was 15 seconds long.
[63:43.04]And after 9 to 10 seconds, that played.
[63:50.71]Is this better?
[63:58.80]This is from like the 80s!
[64:01.20]I don't- what- that- was that a- You can't apparently find it
[64:26.78]How does nobody upload a high quality version of that?
[64:30.56]I have no idea.
[64:36.44]Put Halo back on.
[64:49.34]Zootopia.
[64:53.48]How about Super Mario RPG?
[64:55.84]That's a good one.
[65:05.89]That's what I'm talking about, let's go!
[65:08.11]Oops.
[65:13.13]Oh, let's go!
[65:13.77]Can I get some hype in the chat, please?
[65:15.59]Can I get some hype in the chat, guys?
[65:16.63]You know what I'm saying?
[65:18.49]Type in, like, pipe, space, yeah, baby!
[65:21.87]You know what I'm saying?
[65:32.71]Fucking worst word in the English dictionary.
[65:41.62]That's it.
[65:42.18]What?
[65:44.56]What happened to my YouTube player?
[65:45.78]What?
[65:46.00]It broke.
[65:46.50]What?
[65:47.94]How?
[65:51.20]Am I still on the internet?
[65:52.45]Am I still, like, alive?
[65:56.27]Okay.
[65:57.59]Can I have the chat, please?
[66:45.15]Holy shit!
[66:46.18]Make the other dude do something!
[66:48.86]But I don't have anything for him to do!
[66:51.10]Is there another va- Oh wait, there's a vein right here.
[66:54.02]That one's like a low quality vein.
[66:58.50]Well, he can get the low quality one.
[67:02.29]What the hell was that?
[67:04.15]Was that me?
[67:05.43]Was that me?!
[67:07.35]I'm serious, what was that?
[67:08.41]Was that me talking?
[67:56.57]Here we go.
[67:59.20]Hey, what a great stream.
[68:04.70]I got a nomination for worst stream of 2018.
[68:07.08]I wonder what you guys think it's gonna be.
[68:49.86]I have to do this, I'm sorry guys, I do.
[68:56.69]Sneak em sneak, you're right, good idea.
[69:19.28]Hey, can I get a quick hype in the chat if you think this is cool?
[69:25.15]Okay, no, no, no, for real, don't do that, but I have a real question.
[69:28.03]How often do people ask you to do hype in the chat?
[69:31.01]Like on other YouTubers' streams and stuff.
[69:36.12]Is that actually a thing that people do?
[69:38.12]Nobody does that, right?
[69:40.50]I'm making that whole thing up.
[69:47.94]Like, nobody actually says that.
[69:49.52]People always make it like the joke.
[69:51.34]Right?
[69:52.58]I only got one.
[69:53.34]It's a menu theme.
[70:15.65]I'm just gonna fill one bag and then we can go But this is how you get everyone stronger except for the dog who's just eating food I have a food consumer that's all the dog has done so far
[70:53.72]You don't like OSTs?
[70:59.52]How about just something easy in the background?
[71:08.66]Let's do ambient relaxing music.
[71:16.99]Calm, space, ambient, or deep sleep help.
[71:20.06]It's supposed to help with you, to get you into deep sleep.
[71:28.02]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, pause it.
[71:33.73]Oh, thank god, we're sneaking.
[71:36.37]Everybody stop what you're doing.
[71:38.85]Where'd he go?
[71:41.07]Don't start singing here.
[71:42.15]Where is he?
[71:45.96]Oh, you're right there.
[71:46.52]You're like blending in with the ground.
[71:47.66]Stop what you're doing.
[71:50.38]Don't hit that.
[71:51.20]Don't mind that.
[71:53.20]Both of you, stop.
[71:57.14]Wait for these bandits to pass.
[71:58.28]This is not good.
[72:12.67]I'm warning you.
[72:13.23]Stop talking to each other.
[72:25.03]Alright, I think we're safe.
[72:28.21]Well, I don't know.
[72:28.75]What does this wolf den thing mean?
[72:31.10]I gotta move.
[72:34.50]No, don't go that way.
[72:35.80]Are you crazy?
[72:39.62]Are they just gonna stay on the road?
[72:40.62]Alright, they're gone.
[72:44.43]Alright, good.
[72:45.79]Back to what you were doing, both of you.
[72:52.92]Alright, that's one full bag of copper.
[72:56.48]I feel like we should get maybe a couple more.
[73:04.27]And then after this, we're going to turn off the OST.
[73:08.77]Both of them.
[73:09.19]And then we're going to play in-game sound effects.
[73:22.05]So who can hold this?
[73:24.47]I can.
[73:24.85]We mined all day, but it was worth it, because now I'm going to have a lot.
[73:34.60]Remember, I need money.
[73:37.16]Selling two full backpacks of ore is going to be... You're talking about... Two, four, six, eight... I'm going to make like five grand.
[73:46.30]Four or five thousand...
[73:48.98]Cats for this.
[73:50.44]And then guess what?
[73:51.02]I get to hire another person or I get to train.
[74:00.24]And these guys are leveling up their skills.
[74:03.36]What song is this?
[74:04.02]This is called... The name of the song is... Calm Space Ambient Relaxing Music Deep Sleep Delta Waves Background for Meditation Yoga is the name of the song.
[74:15.51]For those of you wondering.
[74:19.89]Or, let me, in more easier to understand terms, put every single tag possible, every search possible, in the title of my video.
[74:42.51]It's brainwashing me?
[74:44.87]Why?
[74:52.69]You're pretty much watching that right now.
[74:55.56]I got news for you.
[75:00.62]How's everybody doing?
[75:02.84]Well, not bad.
[75:04.64]Two full bags, and then we're... No!
[75:07.54]Just do it.
[75:08.18]Just get it done.
[75:09.06]Save it.
[75:10.06]Three full bags of copper ore.
[75:17.85]Just get it done so I don't have to do it later.
[75:20.82]Somebody just said no.
[75:21.70]Yes.
[75:25.84]Yes, I have to.
[75:28.14]Save it now.
[75:28.94]Sure thing.
[75:34.73]That's not much more.
[75:35.69]That's only like... That's another one bag and then I got seven or eight thousand.
[75:39.21]Then I can buy a cow.
[75:40.65]You guys will not be complaining once I get a cow as part of the frogs and dogs team.
[75:46.89]Why am I sneaking?
[75:47.55]Because it doesn't matter as long as you're sneaking and doing something, you get points towards stealth.
[75:57.26]Alright, now just fill the backpack and we're done.
[76:02.64]That's one, two, three, four, a lot, but just bear with me.
[76:08.93]Bear with me here.
[76:14.93]Put them both in the same one?
[76:16.11]I can't.
[76:18.22]Only one worker is allowed on these veins.
[76:21.24]Alright, it's got an all capitals message.
[76:31.41]Please play this.
[76:32.19]Please play this.
[76:32.89]Please play this.
[76:33.61]Please play this.
[76:34.33]It's the best song.
[76:35.05]Please.
[76:49.15]It's working!
[76:58.52]Wait, are those bandits?
[77:02.52]No, they're mercenaries.
[77:03.60]Wait, they're mercenaries!
[77:09.41]No, none of them are friendly.
[77:15.39]So much stuff.
[77:19.81]Don't encourage people to do that.
[77:21.16]Well, that's me discouraging, right?
[77:26.87]What's happening?
[77:49.92]Barth.
[77:55.20]Hey, look out for Barth.
[78:00.44]Is he a hostile?
[78:02.96]Normal.
[78:04.17]He's a drifter.
[78:04.95]He's patrolling.
[78:10.31]Okay.
[78:11.99]Strength 10.
[78:12.59]Martial arts 2.
[78:15.03]That's not that good.
[78:16.59]Dodge bad.
[78:21.47]I think we can take this guy.
[78:24.07]I got attack, 10.
[78:26.21]Toughness, 1.
[78:27.69]Toughness, 1.
[78:28.49]No attack at all.
[78:29.73]Okay, dog is going to taunt.
[78:32.89]Okay?
[78:33.67]I want taunt on dog.
[78:40.02]And then you, frog boss, is going to be main attack.
[78:45.06]As his dodge is terrible.
[78:46.14]And I'm just going to be the healer.
[78:52.35]Make sure I don't have any more pieces here.
[78:53.77]I need to make sure I don't fuck this whole thing up.
[78:56.46]Alright, everybody stop what you're doing.
[78:59.16]Stop sneaking.
[79:02.14]Nobody is sneaking.
[79:03.08]Okay.
[79:05.38]Let's just play this out for a second.
[79:10.36]I'm going to save this.
[79:16.07]Encounter.
[79:19.23]Now, let's move over here.
[79:21.03]Wait, that's too fast!
[79:26.04]Can I talk?
[79:28.72]I don't think there is a talk button here.
[79:35.93]I got no bubble.
[79:37.52]Follow bodyguard.
[80:10.41]Get him.
[80:14.35]He missed.
[80:16.47]Well this guy, this guy has got nothing.
[80:18.23]We're gonna finally get our first kill and I'm leveling up top-distance shit.
[80:21.51]Just don't let him have anything.
[80:23.78]Just continuously get him.
[80:25.66]He might have like coins in his pocket or something.
[80:30.32]Good, he hasn't hit anyone.
[80:32.30]Perfect!
[80:35.26]What a perfect training dummy this guy really is.
[80:39.41]Barf.
[80:43.55]Got him.
[80:44.69]Okay, now what do we do with him?
[80:45.73]What do I do with him?
[80:48.77]Uh... I thought that was his inventory and I was gonna scream.
[80:54.19]He's got armor.
[80:55.11]Uh, what kind of armor do you have?
[81:00.25]That's pretty nice armor.
[81:01.25]That's cut resistance, efficiency.
[81:03.65]That's harpoon resistance.
[81:04.97]Okay, that's coverage on the arms.
[81:08.36]Uh, cut resistance 80.
[81:09.88]Somebody else needs this.
[81:14.04]80.
[81:14.50]Pause it for a second.
[81:17.65]Valley.
[81:17.99]What about the pants?
[81:20.49]50%.
[81:20.55]Blunt resistance 2, 2.
[81:21.77]And then 50%.
[81:24.17]I'll be taking those on... I need to put them on Frogmust because he's the one that's actually going to be fighting anything.
[81:30.17]Out of trading range.
[81:32.72]I need to be closer.
[81:38.12]So we're going to go with pants.
[81:44.53]What do you have for armor?
[81:48.23]0080, 3470.
[81:48.51]This is better.
[81:49.11]Shoes.
[81:54.22]Okay, what is this?
[81:57.40]Chewsticks!
[81:58.70]Yeah, take it.
[81:59.22]Might as well steal his food.
[82:04.12]Okay, head.
[82:09.30]These are 1.1 times... 1.1 times what you need those.
[82:15.80]Take them.
[82:18.04]Make you faster and get the helmet.
[82:21.29]Didn't even have a weapon, but you have a shirt though.
[82:22.95]Might as well take that and wear it.
[82:26.69]Yeah, he had a chew stick in his boot.
[82:29.83]Give the hat to the dog?
[82:31.99]The dog can't wear anything.
[82:35.69]Okay, now let's... What did I get for strength and toughness?
[82:38.07]Okay, he is good to go now.
[82:39.25]Look at this.
[82:39.57]Six.
[82:40.29]That's ten.
[82:41.45]Three defense, finally.
[82:43.41]Three strength.
[82:46.16]I mean, this... I still suck so much.
[82:48.90]But you get dexterity from swinging.
[82:50.78]Alright, back to what we were doing.
[82:52.10]He's gonna wake up, isn't he?
[82:54.04]How do I make sure he doesn't wake up?
[83:01.18]What should I do with him?
[83:10.74]Save him?
[83:11.30]What do you mean, enslave?
[83:15.50]I can't enslave somebody.
[83:16.92]How do I put him down?
[83:17.62]Well, there goes the hope of doing that.
[83:24.94]What am I supposed to do?
[83:27.18]Pick him up and sell him.
[83:30.05]Well, he's dying.
[83:31.29]Whatever.
[83:32.93]Welcome to Kenshi.
[83:35.15]I've been there before.
[83:35.93]It sucks.
[83:36.39]Don't worry.
[83:37.55]You'll just get mad and make a new character anyways, like I did.
[83:44.18]Alright, back to it.
[83:44.84]Alright, that's good.
[83:55.88]Speed it up again.
[83:56.52]He's not going to get up, right?
[83:57.84]What is his... He's dying.
[84:00.06]He's going to die, right?
[84:00.74]Alright, got... Okay, copper coming in.
[84:10.79]Let's go.
[84:16.01]Sell him, sell him, sell him.
[84:18.50]Well, let me just fill up my bags first, and then I'll take a look at what I got.
[84:27.35]Use him to train up your first aid.
[84:30.51]Wait, hold on.
[84:31.25]I can heal him, kill... I figured out what we're gonna do with this guy.
[84:35.97]Okay, yep.
[84:37.68]Where is his body?
[84:42.69]He's dying.
[84:43.52]Let's heal him.
[84:45.12]And then kill him again.
[84:46.16]And then heal him.
[84:46.84]And then kill him again.
[84:47.58]And then heal him and kill him again.
[84:48.72]And I'll level up my... Welcome to Kenshi, dude.
[84:54.08]Sorry.
[84:56.89]You got all the heals.
[84:59.19]First aid.
[85:01.65]You come over here.
[85:02.67]You get behind him.
[85:15.73]So how we doing?
[85:16.47]He's currently being healed.
[85:25.44]Am I healing him?
[85:29.02]Yeah, I am.
[85:30.50]Let's take a look at my first aid stats.
[85:33.42]First aid, field medic.
[85:40.18]That's so funny.
[85:41.32]Level up the... Come on!
[85:42.52]First aid skills, 4.1.
[85:46.33]Level up!
[85:49.23]Alright, he's going to get up after this.
[85:52.23]Is he?
[85:52.45]I'm just waiting for him to stand up.
[86:05.84]He's in a recovery combo.
[86:09.94]Well then I'm just going to... This is going to be my training dummy.
[86:17.71]I'm just gonna carry him around until he wakes up.
[86:30.00]How many of these am I using?
[86:31.95]Not very many, okay.
[86:33.17]He's almost at full health.
[86:35.17]Alright, so now he just has to come out.
[86:37.35]Your head is in the process of healing.
[86:39.97]Just pick him up, and let's bring him over here.
[86:48.25]This poor guy.
[86:49.60]Look, I'm sorry you were the one person wandering around.
[86:52.42]Alright, let's get... How are we doing on, uh... Alright, I can get, like, another few... Alright, that's fine.
[87:10.23]This is gonna recover on my shoulder.
[87:18.71]Almost there.
[87:25.99]Look, desperate times call for desperate measures, you know what I'm saying?
[87:35.46]Use him as a spare or backpack.
[87:44.47]Alright, one more and that's it.
[87:46.09]Nah, look at that, I could get a whole entire inventory and then have tons of money.
[87:49.37]What do you mean, I can?
[88:03.30]You know what, I can.
[88:04.56]You're right.
[88:05.86]But what if he gets up and runs away somehow?
[88:21.83]He can't run away with all the ore on him because he'll be way down.
[88:25.00]You know, that's true.
[88:27.16]He'll be too heavy.
[88:37.85]Why am I getting tired?
[88:40.03]Why am I slowing down here?
[88:41.37]Excuse me.
[88:41.89]Alright, let's put him down.
[88:53.78]Uh, put his body down.
[88:57.38]Okay, let's see.
[88:59.64]He's on, he's on, okay, he's on, he's gonna wake up, he's gonna wake up.
[89:03.69]Everybody get ready.
[89:10.15]He's gonna get up.
[89:11.87]He's gonna wake up in... Quick, weigh him down, weigh him down quick.
[89:18.63]In case he runs.
[89:41.82]Okay, you ain't going anywhere.
[89:46.04]Now let's get everybody selected.
[89:51.58]Just gonna get up in a second here.
[89:53.02]Uh...
[90:08.14]Alright, well, I did what I wanted to do.
[90:14.54]You get over there and mine this one again.
[90:25.21]That freed up the backpack.
[90:32.20]Keep an eye on him, because if he gets up and runs away, I'll be very, very sad.
[90:41.87]Save it now?
[90:42.83]You're right, yes you're right.
[90:51.92]So I got so many backpacks full of money.
[90:54.20]I'm gonna be able to buy a house for us to live.
[90:57.74]Finally.
[91:01.04]Second backpack guy is perfect.
[91:03.43]And when he gets up I can take the stuff off him and then we can hurt him again.
[91:07.17]Level up our sword skills.
[91:16.03]Recovery coma.
[91:16.85]Minus 34.
[91:17.61]I gotta be ready for when that happens.
[91:19.93]Should be pretty close.
[91:31.74]You're so bad at mining, dude.
[91:32.86]Come on.
[91:37.38]The dog... Yeah, we need some more food.
[91:39.14]We gotta get to a town.
[91:41.39]We should be fine until we get there, though.
[91:42.93]How you doing?
[91:44.65]Minus 31.
[91:44.89]He's got a while.
[91:47.40]Whoa, whoa!
[91:52.63]Hungry bandits.
[91:53.95]I don't think they can see us, though.
[91:54.91]They're too far away.
[92:03.32]Yeah, they stay on the road, it looks like.
[92:04.98]Don't come down here.
[92:05.82]No, they're not coming down here.
[92:09.79]Good.
[92:17.34]We're safe.
[92:21.00]Should be sneaking, you're right.
[92:22.00]This is day two in a row of mining.
[92:34.22]Almost done and we're not going to have to do this again for a long time.
[92:38.16]Trust me.
[92:41.08]Saved the game, I did.
[92:47.56]How's our friend doing?
[92:49.16]27.
[92:49.30]Uh, Frillity!
[92:55.17]Thank you, Frillity, for the five community subs.
[93:00.39]Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[93:02.57]There's a lot of those tonight.
[93:05.29]It's time to go in about 25 seconds.
[93:08.75]Maybe a little less.
[93:10.71]We have enough room for one, two, three, four, five, six...
[93:15.63]When do they stand up?
[93:16.93]When they get to zero, right?
[93:29.12]End of the mining voice?
[93:29.97]Yeah, it's getting close.
[93:30.65]What am I going to do about the guy's weight?
[93:36.23]I'm going to carry him.
[93:37.45]Someone's going to carry him.
[93:45.47]Pack, Bold, Holy Nation.
[93:46.87]Okay, that's fine.
[93:48.89]This guy's not affiliated with the Holy Nation, so... My labor has to be so high on this character at this point, really.
[94:05.18]One, two, three.
[94:05.80]Three more.
[94:14.54]Nice, 20.
[94:14.86]Okay, I got time.
[94:16.52]See, then we're gonna put him over there and just kill him again.
[94:21.20]Callie Brady, thanks for the five community subs, Callie Brady.
[94:26.04]Thank you.
[94:29.74]Community subs.
[94:32.78]One more.
[94:33.26]Wait, oh!
[94:36.88]I just, I'm sorry, I actually got scared.
[94:38.14]No, it was me talking.
[94:40.86]I saw the text and I freaked out.
[94:42.10]I'm sorry, I just screamed.
[94:43.03]One more and that's it.
[94:50.82]Okay.
[94:52.24]Done.
[94:53.20]I have so many.
[94:55.30]We're good.
[94:56.58]Everybody regroup.
[95:03.61]So let's take a look at what we got.
[95:06.45]Everybody's sneaking still, right?
[95:08.07]So... We have one...
[95:13.04]One, two, three, four bags.
[95:18.30]This guy's gonna get up very soon, and when he does, we kill him again.
[95:21.71]So who has the strength to pick him up?
[95:23.07]Probably you.
[95:27.27]Stealth KO him.
[95:28.59]No.
[95:29.49]Pick him up.
[95:35.47]I got my four backpacks.
[95:37.82]Let's all stay together.
[95:41.17]So I'm going to give you the job to follow.
[95:44.41]You.
[95:45.85]Follow.
[95:48.53]Alright.
[95:50.03]Let's move.
[95:50.71]Save.
[95:50.95]Now here's the real question.
[95:56.66]Where the hell am I going to go?
[95:59.52]I could go back here.
[96:02.04]To Blister Hill.
[96:05.64]Could I build a base?
[96:07.72]Should I build a base here?
[96:09.96]I could just keep going, but I'm out of food, though.
[96:18.57]I mean, this is the easiest one.
[96:22.21]Although, I'm not sure where a town is.
[96:26.34]I could go down this... Let's just take a look and see what's on this road.
[96:34.30]Wait till this... This guy's gonna get up in a minute.
[96:35.70]I need to be prepared when he does.
[96:41.39]Explain the rules for New Year's?
[96:44.75]Uh, in a minute.
[96:50.72]Minus 15, still out.
[96:53.96]Are we all sneaking?
[96:55.74]Now we are.
[96:58.85]Save before the trip?
[96:59.89]Yeah, I will.
[97:01.01]Just make sure everyone's ready to go.
[97:10.07]Make sure I don't... I gotta be careful on the road, though, because of bandits.
[97:12.83]And this dude's gonna wake up soon, so I kinda need to go off the road.
[97:16.04]Yep.
[97:16.82]There's gonna be a New Year's thing.
[97:18.08]We're gonna go over it.
[97:19.36]It's gonna be a significant portion of this stream.
[97:26.06]Discovered stack.
[97:28.08]Well... There's stack.
[97:34.27]Looks like we're going there.
[97:38.54]Alright, I don't see anybody on the road, but I'm going to keep my eye on him.
[97:46.80]Because once that gets to be about minus 10... When is he actually going to get up?
[97:52.72]Minus 10?
[97:53.76]Or 0?
[97:53.98]Just a second to load.
[98:08.89]Because this was such... Alright, let me just break it down.
[98:11.70]Because there are quite a few people here now.
[98:14.13]So I might as well just go over it.
[98:16.41]So this was a very, very last minute thing.
[98:20.71]I don't know if whoever was here yesterday, we talked about what was the worst stream that I did this year.
[98:25.61]And people were saying, oh, this one, this one!
[98:27.71]It was just a joke, right?
[98:29.50]But then earlier today, I was sitting in the chat, and it was, hey, like, wouldn't that be kind of funny if we just did an award ceremony where I go to the studio, and I set up a podium and shit, and I get in a suit, and we do a full 10 to 15 category, worst stuff I did this year.
[98:52.04]And maybe like a couple of best of what happened this year, maybe.
[98:57.32]And we're talking... That's the thing about categories, is because this came up so... It wasn't very long ago, right?
[99:03.69]It was so recent.
[99:05.23]That... A significant portion of this stream is going to be coming up with categories.
[99:14.20]So...
[99:16.72]We're gonna do that.
[99:17.62]I have like probably seven or eight that I want to do.
[99:20.15]But we need to come up with some before the stream is over.
[99:23.27]So then you guys can nominate.
[99:25.33]There's a channel in the Discord that's currently locked.
[99:27.23]It's not, you know, we're obviously not ready to do it yet.
[99:30.09]So after we do the categories, then you guys are gonna give nominations.
[99:37.21]And then a day from now, I'm gonna close the nominations.
[99:42.17]You're gonna vote in the Discord, because I'm gonna put a poll up in the Discord, because I'm not gonna be streaming over the next two days.
[99:47.83]Because this is gonna take a lot of time to get ready.
[99:52.51]So, after today's stream, the next stream will be on New Year's Eve.
[99:58.16]Because I'm gonna cut up videos.
[100:01.04]with all the nominees.
[100:03.12]So let's say it's like worst overall stream of 2018 is the final, obviously, final, uh, award.
[100:10.23]I'm gonna just, whatever the nominees are, I'm gonna, it's gonna be, uh, here are the nominees!
[100:13.91]And here is a presentation of the worst streams.
[100:16.95]The worst jokes.
[100:18.99]You know, I'm gonna do 10, 15 different categorical videos.
[100:28.18]That's what's gonna happen.
[100:33.96]And I'm gonna obviously give a speech for every category to talk about what I feel about it.
[100:47.57]Worst frame was your WoW one?
[100:49.13]That wasn't 2018 though.
[100:53.05]I'm pretty sure that was 2017.
[101:03.51]Stop the yoga music.
[101:04.89]Alright.
[101:05.27]Yeah.
[101:05.41]Yeah.
[101:05.73]Yeah.
[101:05.91]Yeah.
[101:06.09]Yeah, you're right.
[101:06.55]You're right Worst new character is gonna be one
[101:26.29]Yeah, the worst joke?
[101:27.90]There's gonna be worst overall joke of 2018 and then there's gonna be other categories as well.
[101:32.92]As if.
[101:34.10]As if?
[101:36.66]What was I trying to say there?
[101:37.94]Like.
[101:39.15]I.E.
[101:39.61]is what I was trying to say.
[101:41.39]Worst joke that took at least five minutes to set up?
[101:49.41]Worst noise?
[101:50.88]Like the fucking worst noise I've made all year?
[101:58.55]Worst voice impression?
[101:59.69]There's plenty of categories we can come up with here.
[102:06.74]The worst haircut?
[102:07.68]Absolutely.
[102:08.98]And then you'll see clips of all the different worst hairs that have happened over the years, and you're gonna pick what the worst fucking one was.
[102:14.48]No, I was supposed to turn that off, not turn it back on.
[102:21.12]Worst category.

[103:19.15]Like the worst stream, where the chat was the worst in that stream.
[103:27.29]Nominee, all of them.
[103:31.12]Then you guys have to accept the award.
[103:32.80]I don't wanna play that.
[103:48.39]Okay, no OST for a little while.
[103:49.99]Let me just play.
[103:54.11]Alright, so let's go.
[103:55.31]I gotta watch his health.
[103:59.13]Minus 10, let's go.
[104:04.67]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[104:05.73]Excuse me.
[104:09.09]I'm gonna go to stack.
[104:09.97]I should be able to kill him again outside of stack.
[104:13.58]At least I think so.
[104:21.22]Getting there.
[104:56.99]This guy's gonna get up and get all the fucking ore.
[105:00.09]This guy gets free stuff.
[105:02.45]Really?
[105:06.42]And there you come.
[105:07.26]Hey, hey, holy nation.
[105:08.54]Welcome.
[105:08.98]Thanks.
[105:09.26]Welcome to the party, guys.
[105:20.05]What's he gonna do when he gets up?
[105:21.35]I loaded this guy full of stuff.
[105:23.71]Dying, dying, unconscious, dying.
[105:27.10]I'm going to reload it, but I just want to see what the hell he does.
[105:32.52]You know, what happens when you wake up like this?
[105:34.12]Your bag is full of gold.
[105:35.94]You have money in your bag, and there's three people dead, and they all have the same material on them.
[105:49.88]Wait a minute.
[105:53.24]Oh.
[106:03.74]We're okay.
[106:04.58]I can level up my first aid.
[106:05.44]I don't have a med kit.
[106:22.77]We're okay.
[106:24.31]He's coming up.
[106:24.69]First aid.
[106:41.05]He's going to stand up.
[106:41.75]He is at full everything.
[106:45.51]Don't kill in front of the holy guys.
[106:47.00]I have to follow him.
[106:52.26]He's okay.
[106:53.08]This is leveling up.
[106:53.96]The toughness to... Remember, I got to level those up.
[106:56.44]I can't just reload every time.
[106:59.08]The dog okay?
[107:06.93]Holy shit.
[107:07.61]Come on.
[107:08.79]No, he's waking up.
[107:13.60]No, no, no, no.
[107:15.06]Come on.
[107:17.04]What's he gonna do?
[107:18.92]Just keep an eye on him.
[107:22.48]The dog is dying.
[107:27.37]Heal the dog.
[107:34.73]I need to...
[108:28.00]You don't have a weapon.
[108:29.76]Take out your weapon.
[108:32.64]Take out your weapon.
[108:33.50]Why am I not using my weapon?
[108:42.58]Wait, it's because my arms are both broken.
[108:46.22]And I'm flailing them around like spaghetti.
[108:54.49]I got him.
[109:00.39]Do I have a splint?
[109:01.23]I said, are you alive?
[109:06.69]They're dying and shit.
[109:08.41]This is not... I have to let him go.
[109:09.77]I have to let this guy go.
[109:14.37]With all the ore.
[109:17.47]I have to.
[109:19.36]What do you mean, no?
[109:23.54]Reload?
[109:24.30]Hold on, I gotta run.
[109:38.84]Like, there's nothing I can do about this.
[109:40.66]I have to let him go.
[109:53.81]I got attacked by wild wolves, and then... That was it.
[109:59.09]Congratulations.
[109:59.77]I hope you enjoy... I hope you enjoy all the fucking free ore, because I can't... I have... I gotta go back and heal everybody.
[110:11.49]I'm too weak?
[110:12.11]Yes, I am too weak.
[110:13.17]Alright, who needs it the most?
[110:14.99]You're alright.
[110:15.91]You are not alright.
[110:19.35]Give me another medkit.
[110:26.83]I need to drop some splints.
[110:29.45]Medkit.
[110:30.86]Medkit.
[110:32.62]Alright, pick him up.
[110:37.06]First aid.
[110:37.50]On dog.
[110:39.36]On dog.
[110:57.46]Reload and pick up ore before he wakes up.
[111:00.72]No, that's too... no.
[111:02.34]I gotta... Alright, dog is in recovery coma.
[111:06.82]You need to be healed as well.
[111:17.18]At some point I can't just redo every one of my mistakes.
[111:25.52]Plus I need this to happen.
[111:27.85]Because I have to take the damage.
[111:29.93]You have to get better.
[111:31.45]Toughness is important.
[111:32.45]Okay.
[111:34.75]Do I have a... I got a splint.
[111:36.91]I need to splint my arm.
[111:42.96]How do I splint my own arm?
[111:46.92]So, I'm alright.
[111:47.80]Canned Roth is fine.
[111:49.84]Needs to recover.
[111:50.46]I'm going to have to pick up both of the animals.
[111:55.04]I mean, both people.
[111:56.96]I'm all fucked up.
[111:57.74]Give me some... Well, getting the use out of these, that's for sure.
[112:09.89]Can I carry both people?
[112:11.61]I think I can carry them both.
[112:13.75]But I have one fucked up arm.
[112:23.17]Okay.
[112:24.91]Splint my injuries...
[112:29.72]Is it not splinted?
[112:30.98]How many splints do I need?
[112:40.63]No, it's splinted, right?
[112:44.09]Okay.
[112:45.53]Everybody's good.
[112:46.99]Just hungry, hungry.
[112:48.05]Okay.
[112:52.38]Why did I splint the wrong arm?
[113:09.64]I can't pick him up with this arm.
[113:17.84]Well, hold on.
[113:21.34]What's wrong with me?
[113:26.84]Oh boy, there's food.
[113:28.14]I need to... That's worth money.
[113:41.96]You need to get up.
[113:43.70]This is so dangerous being on this road with... I can't just stay here.
[113:47.34]I have to... Alright.
[113:51.41]You're gonna get up.
[113:51.85]We gotta hide over here.
[113:56.51]Away from any bandits.
[114:05.97]I'll make a campfire.
[114:06.82]We'll eat.
[114:17.17]Right here.
[114:20.77]And then I need... Okay, I got some food.
[114:22.31]I need to go a little further out.
[114:26.95]Right here.
[114:32.82]Pick up.
[114:36.34]Okay, I just splintered the dog.
[114:43.55]Campfire.
[114:48.53]Alright, campfire.
[114:50.47]Camping.
[114:51.53]Camp bed doesn't cost anything but a campfire here.
[114:58.71]Anywhere in the wild.
[114:59.48]Uh... Oh, that was weird.
[115:03.76]Okay.
[115:04.02]Right here.
[115:05.58]And then we're gonna make a camp bed right here.
[115:08.90]Make three of them.
[115:09.56]Building.
[115:15.49]Building.
[115:17.17]Why are you standing in the fire?
[115:19.61]Alright, building... Wait, I didn't... I can't make those?
[115:23.03]Three of them for three people to be in the bed.
[115:27.33]Select a construction to check its status.
[115:29.35]This shows how many building materials I need to complete the construction.
[115:31.95]Once the conditions bar is filled, the construction is complete.
[115:36.17]Build.
[115:38.16]I need...
[115:42.03]What do I need?
[115:43.17]Sleeping bag?
[115:44.13]One more building material would be needed.
[115:45.51]Why do I need one sleeping bag?
[115:46.83]Well, alright, whatever.
[115:48.21]Cook the food.
[115:54.62]Don't eat them both.
[115:55.44]Alright.
[115:59.66]How are we doing?
[116:02.34]Recovery coma.
[116:03.06]With the dog.
[116:05.06]Recovery coma.
[116:09.69]Alright.
[116:12.42]Uh, I guess now I'm just gonna sit here.
[116:18.12]I'm off the road.
[116:18.98]I should be away from anybody.
[116:23.83]I don't have any sleeping bags, so I can't do that.
[116:26.17]Take off taunt.
[116:29.01]They're gonna be in a coma for a long time.
[116:32.77]Save the game.
[116:38.04]So this is like post-attack.
[116:39.30]We got attacked.
[116:44.16]Alright.
[116:45.72]Now, we times three idle.
[116:49.53]Wait, hold on.
[116:50.11]Is there anything I can get?
[116:51.81]I need to go maybe look for supplies or something.
[116:56.73]What's over here?
[116:57.25]Is there anything I can do here?
[117:09.07]Right arm's getting better.
[117:11.45]Very slowly.
[117:12.09]I don't think this is anything.
[117:15.21]Can I fit any more stuff?
[117:18.99]I know that there is a few things over here.
[117:21.40]Animal teeth.
[117:22.00]I think I can pick them up.
[117:27.82]Um... I can't... I still have this meat.
[117:33.16]I need to get rid of, uh... I need to put this back on him.
[117:35.77]I need to go back.
[117:48.97]Okay.
[117:50.99]Trade.
[117:53.79]So, I need to put away some of this stuff.
[117:58.29]These stack, right?
[118:00.58]Why not?
[118:03.30]Oh, fuck.
[118:03.76]Who ate it?
[118:04.84]Did I eat that?
[118:05.86]He's the only person that's eaten.
[118:07.00]Alright, I need to be able to take the skin, and there's another thing of meat over there.
[118:22.15]Can't pick that up.
[118:22.85]Why?
[118:30.72]Is it longer than that?
[118:32.22]What was that all about?
[118:33.96]Alright, that's good.
[118:34.50]Okay, cook the meat.
[118:45.07]Should just do it automatically, right?
[118:46.99]Yep.
[118:50.51]What was that noise?
[118:58.42]Seriously though, what was that?
[119:04.12]Whoa!
[119:04.80]No!
[119:05.30]Get away from me!
[119:07.50]What are you doing over here?
[119:08.66]Why are you over here?
[119:10.16]Ugh!
[119:12.80]What are you doing here?
[119:14.24]Is he gonna know?
[119:16.58]I have to sneak away.
[119:18.03]But is he gonna see these two?
[119:20.57]He smells the meat.
[119:21.77]You asshole!
[120:01.30]I have a crippled arm.
[120:07.00]Can I play dead?
[120:07.90]Hold on, how do I play dead?
[120:25.61]Where's play dead?
[120:38.85]He's going the other way.
[120:39.53]Oh, come on.
[120:47.87]RNG, please be in my favor.
[120:49.35]Go the other way.
[120:49.87]Gotta get that meat out of there.
[120:54.48]Okay, that's fine.
[121:04.36]Good.
[121:06.54]Play dead.
[121:07.80]Play dead.
[121:08.50]What do you guys got on recovery time?
[121:12.54]So long.
[121:14.08]You not so much, but I can carry the dog.
[121:15.64]Okay, I think it's time.
[121:20.83]I'm just gonna sneak back and forth like this while I do x3 speed.
[121:58.33]Fight with honor.
[121:59.27]You can't fight with honor with a broken arm against 15 people.
[122:06.78]We gotta move, camp.
[122:10.72]I gotta pick some- I gotta pick you up and we gotta go.
[122:12.80]Maybe not.
[122:20.27]RNG, come on.
[122:23.41]He just needs to wake up and then we can get the hell out of here.
[122:29.87]Minus 35.
[122:30.19]There's no way I can speed that up at all.
[122:43.92]Food.
[122:54.07]Oh, free food.
[122:54.91]Come on.
[122:58.99]Somebody's dead, too.
[123:00.77]Come on.
[123:01.31]Kill them and move on.
[123:09.54]Put out the fire.
[123:27.97]Where are they?
[123:28.67]They're coming this way, aren't they?
[123:32.27]They're right there.
[123:36.65]I could kill these three easy.
[123:39.37]No, I don't have... I can't even use my weapon.
[123:41.19]They're all killing each other.
[123:42.23]This is perfect.
[123:43.57]Let me sneak over there.
[123:51.67]Because they get on the road and I get free supplies right here.
[123:55.92]Hold on.
[123:56.50]I gotta dump this stuff over here.
[123:58.80]Temporarily.
[124:03.22]I got a bunch of shit.
[124:04.16]I'm gonna just put it down right here.
[124:05.76]Make sure nobody comes over here.
[124:06.86]Because there's probably supplies and food.
[124:09.50]Okay, I'm gonna go for it.
[124:14.49]I'm gonna save it right here.
[124:25.87]There they are.
[124:34.71]Alright.
[124:35.81]Come on.
[124:36.13]Get up there.
[124:40.95]We have a couple of bodies.
[124:45.09]Yep.
[124:46.00]Come on.
[124:46.82]Get over there.
[124:51.60]Body number one.
[124:57.87]You got nothing important.
[125:00.11]Where's the wolves?
[125:01.03]Body two, right here.
[125:04.34]Nothing worth taking.
[125:08.38]Nothing.
[125:08.72]Where are those wolves?
[125:11.52]Right here.
[125:11.92]Come on, really?
[125:20.62]Yes!
[125:31.27]Alright, go!
[125:37.51]Bandits?
[125:37.97]Are these bandits or are these holy men?
[125:40.63]Holy men, okay.
[125:41.29]We're good.
[125:43.53]I brought some more supplies back.
[125:44.72]We should be fine after this.
[125:53.58]Get another camp built.
[125:57.28]Campfire.
[126:04.23]Alright, get the food up there.
[126:05.77]Should be already doing it, right?
[126:06.73]Alright.
[126:17.24]Are we good?
[126:17.86]I don't see anybody.
[126:20.34]Should be fine.
[126:21.84]What is all this?
[126:22.58]Oh, that's my... Okay.
[126:24.34]I need to... It's fine.
[126:27.37]Food's more important right now.
[126:37.75]They can still eat, right?
[126:39.71]If they're unconscious.
[126:42.11]Or they have to wait till they get up.
[126:50.96]These pelts are worth... Okay, what's worth more money?
[126:54.36]The pelts or the... Let's see.
[127:00.87]We're good.
[127:01.79]Save it again.
[127:05.10]How do you fix your arm?
[127:06.18]I need a splint, and I already used it.
[127:08.08]I don't think I have any more.
[127:12.70]I do.
[127:13.20]Put it on the ground here.
[127:22.79]Didn't I already do this?
[127:26.05]Alright, so that leaves me with 240...
[127:33.16]Yeah, these are 175, so that's okay.
[127:34.96]I'm alright with that.
[127:36.50]These sell for... not very much each.
[127:39.58]I need to free up some space.
[127:40.66]I'd rather have two more coppers.
[127:46.70]And let's open up your bag.
[127:48.30]I need to trade with you.
[127:52.12]Let's put these in here.
[128:03.59]Alright.
[128:04.05]Get these on you.
[128:10.94]Rearrange this.
[128:11.66]I can take some more.
[128:20.06]And that's good.
[128:21.66]Alright, now you just have to recover and we have to get the hell out of here.
[128:31.24]You've been healed.
[128:32.73]Alright, minus 28.
[128:34.86]Save it.
[128:39.24]Where are you going?
[128:39.84]Make a plan now.
[128:40.70]That's true.
[128:41.32]Okay.
[128:42.78]I mean, I already had a plan.
[128:44.26]I was gonna go to stack.
[128:46.24]It's right there.
[128:47.06]It's right here.
[128:50.58]Maybe I should just run him to stack.
[128:53.06]Or run the dog to stack, and then he can get up later.
[128:57.48]That might be worth doing.
[129:03.12]Dog is not going to get up for a long time.
[129:05.32]Neither will you.
[129:08.37]Splint the dog?
[129:09.05]Uh, did I?
[129:12.03]I did, I thought.
[129:12.71]I'm going to have a splint right here.
[129:15.09]I have first aid here.
[129:18.07]Splint.
[129:19.17]No, I can't.
[129:20.67]Can't splint myself either.
[129:21.67]I don't know how far away that is, though.
[129:32.30]I wonder if that's a good idea.
[129:33.40]Just, you know what?
[129:34.32]I think that's what I'm going to do.
[129:36.10]Pick up the dog.
[129:38.42]Get to stack.
[129:39.62]Put dog somewhere safe.
[129:42.98]And then when he gets up eventually here, walk to stack.
[129:50.70]That's the plan.
[129:51.90]Let's hope nothing goes wrong.
[129:55.76]Stack.
[129:57.76]Good luck, canned Roth.
[130:01.58]Let's go.
[130:02.43]I gotta move.
[130:03.09]I can't just sit out here.
[130:06.11]The sacrifice needs to be made.
[130:09.63]I've got the material.
[130:10.67]Ah, I need the backpack.
[130:13.95]Fuck.
[130:15.85]Give me the backpack.
[130:17.93]Just in case something terrible happens to you.
[130:27.60]Backpack.
[130:29.86]Alright.
[130:31.88]No.
[130:32.18]Get on there.
[130:34.52]Let's see.
[130:35.06]We got... We got all these materials.
[130:37.60]Alright.
[130:38.04]Good luck.
[130:38.84]See you later.
[130:39.22]Let's head... to... Stack.
[130:47.01]It's right here.
[130:47.53]Hopefully this is, like, not a hostile town or something.
[130:51.39]That would be a horrible pain in the ass.
[130:54.15]Good luck.
[130:54.85]See you soon.
[130:55.37]Take care of yourself.
[130:56.85]I hope you're okay in, like, 15 minutes.
[131:04.82]Nobody on the road?
[131:05.62]I think we're safe.
[131:12.49]The dog... I think the dog... No, the dog is not dead.
[131:14.53]The dog is recovering.
[131:16.87]Everybody's fine.
[131:20.13]Sneaking?
[131:20.53]Yes, I'm sneaking because it gives you points.
[131:22.99]Take a look.
[131:24.79]Stealth.
[131:25.77]Stealth is increasing because I'm sneaking.
[131:31.61]Or it was.
[131:33.44]Is it not anymore?
[131:39.38]It was doing it before.
[131:44.40]It only increases when you're near people.
[131:52.33]Well.
[131:55.67]Never mind.
[132:05.38]Okay, I'm almost there.
[132:06.36]Alright, how you doing over here?
[132:13.08]Who is this?
[132:16.08]What did you... He still has everything.
[132:21.56]He's fine.
[132:22.38]What did he take?
[132:22.94]He didn't take anything.
[132:29.50]I still have all the material.
[132:30.82]What did he even take?
[132:38.85]Food?
[132:39.45]Did I even have any food?
[132:42.98]He took the food!
[132:48.79]Where am I?
[132:49.29]Alright, hold on.
[132:50.37]I should have put out the fire.
[132:55.22]Just get up there.
[132:56.00]Oh, Mickey's still at your good?
[133:04.44]I'm gonna get up soon.
[133:14.56]Alright, I made it.
[133:18.54]Drop dog off.
[133:20.94]Holy sentinel.
[133:28.03]Are you kidding me?
[133:36.47]Free food.
[133:40.09]Why can't I stack it in my inventory?
[133:43.93]Damn it.
[133:46.17]They'll stay here, right?
[133:52.53]They'll stay.
[133:53.52]I'm going to go right to a shop.
[133:57.14]You're still okay.
[133:58.08]9-17.
[133:58.56]No bandits or anything.
[134:04.04]What?
[134:06.91]Love and devotion, brother.
[134:07.71]Your time for a moment.
[134:08.85]I don't have time for this.
[134:18.77]Divine blessings, brother.
[134:19.97]Darkness tries to make its way to our hollow lands.
[134:21.87]Only through vigilance can we defeat it.
[134:23.51]I need to check your belongings.
[134:25.81]Holy brother, may I?
[134:38.30]You fucking assholes.
[134:44.29]Take the book, huh?
[134:45.71]Take the book.
[134:46.45]Take the book.
[134:47.05]Bring the book.
[134:48.03]Take the book.
[134:48.93]Get the book.
[134:50.33]You need the book.
[134:55.93]I stole this book and now they're gonna know.
[135:02.53]You need it not to get kicked out.
[135:04.07]It's stolen.
[135:09.16]I stole all this stuff.
[135:43.90]I understand.
[135:46.30]Good, let's see.
[135:47.26]Ah, the Holy Flame.
[135:48.42]Well, just a quick check, brother.
[135:51.40]Looks clean.
[135:53.67]I was supposed to have the book.
[136:27.41]Uh... Get me into a... I need a saloon.
[136:30.80]STAT!
[136:33.18]Right over here, come on.
[136:34.02]Go to the bathroom.
[136:35.46]Quickly get over here and sell this stuff.
[136:38.62]We demand an apology.
[136:43.02]Alright, look.
[136:44.42]Do I have to say I'm sorry when there's been, like, eight out of ten times you guys made me do something that I wasn't supposed to do?
[136:54.97]It's like the boy who cried wolf.
[137:01.31]Let's see your wares.
[137:03.45]Sell.
[137:03.71]Look at that money.
[137:19.18]Not even half of it.
[137:20.84]$6,500.
[137:25.84]We accept apologies in the form of Doom OSTs.
[137:30.66]Well, wouldn't you?
[137:32.79]Yes, you would.
[137:33.41]I don't want this weapon.
[137:41.65]Okay.
[137:47.08]So, that is 6,700.
[137:49.74]How are we doing over here?
[137:53.16]Minus 15.
[137:54.10]I might have to come out and get him.
[137:55.73]Let's put the dog down somewhere to hang out.
[138:00.20]The stream that cried book.
[138:03.91]Yeah, I gotta come out and get him.
[138:07.37]I have to.
[138:11.27]Now I'm gonna put the dog down.
[138:15.43]Thanks for the money.
[138:16.54]See you later.
[138:19.78]Dog will just hang out over here somewhere.
[138:25.22]Put down dog.
[138:26.68]Dog is just recovering.
[138:27.76]Dog doesn't have any items or anything, so.
[138:31.14]And I'm bringing it all the way back here to go.
[138:34.07]I can run now.
[138:34.75]I actually can sprint.
[138:36.07]So let's save it.
[138:40.31]And get here.
[138:41.49]Turn it on.
[138:41.99]I need to go pick you up.
[138:43.26]Because I don't think you're going to get up in time.
[138:46.82]It's riskier.
[138:49.32]Who's on this road?
[138:54.99]Holy servants, that's fine.
[139:04.20]What a disaster.
[139:05.46]I haven't even done anything.
[139:06.54]We put on OSTs.
[139:09.94]And then I got killed three times.
[139:11.29]Alright, make sure there's nothing on the ground here.
[139:16.83]There is some animal teeth.
[139:17.99]Might as well just get it.
[139:25.39]Alright, back it up.
[139:28.01]Nothing else on the ground.
[139:30.49]Let's go.
[139:39.38]Alright, the front door.
[139:41.20]Let's go.
[139:41.66]Out.
[139:43.04]And is that... are these raiders?
[139:54.56]Pack Beast.
[139:57.42]Um... I'm... Am I gonna cross the... There's something... Wait, wait.
[140:00.80]We got a potential... We got a loot situation coming up here, I think.
[140:03.96]Because we got a fight brewing between some holy servants.
[140:09.99]Are they raiding this town or something?
[140:19.05]Nomad.
[140:21.56]Should I not be running over to them?
[140:38.45]Something's gonna break out here.
[140:40.27]Are these competing factions?
[140:50.23]No, they're going right to the front door.
[140:54.02]The dogs are just a lot like the weird animal pigs that just can go in?
[140:57.46]Okay.
[141:05.82]Wait, what is going on over here?
[141:11.36]Well, that was quite the distraction.
[141:12.72]Free meat.
[141:13.32]I thought they were coming to me.
[141:20.31]They were not coming to me.
[141:22.77]What, am I going to get this meat?
[141:30.37]Gimme, gimme, gimme.
[141:33.83]Did they already take it?
[141:34.96]No, they didn't.
[141:38.44]Let's go.
[141:40.38]And meat on these guys, too, probably.
[141:42.08]This would be good.
[141:44.22]Oh, yeah.
[141:47.27]Can't believe they're not taking this.
[141:48.19]This stuff is so valuable.
[141:52.53]That's even more money.
[141:54.34]Cool.
[141:54.48]Let's meet up with the dog and go from here.
[142:10.10]Okay, I gotta put you down.
[142:16.20]Easy.
[142:18.16]Alright, minus seven.
[142:19.40]Let's go ahead and swap out.
[142:20.66]Oh, you got a lot of stuff.
[142:26.43]Nobody will steal these if I leave it on them, right?
[142:28.21]They might.
[142:35.87]For the first time, I'm gonna have more than ten grand, I think.
[142:45.30]Save Put the guys in bed.
[142:50.40]Yeah after I get up after I get liquid cash is when I'm gonna I'll take care of the two And we'll go from there Buy a second dog and breed dogs.
[143:11.59]Oh
[143:16.55]Can you do that?
[143:24.29]98, 72, that's too bad.
[143:26.17]Oh well.
[143:29.63]An idea, two dogs.
[143:32.75]That is an idea.
[143:33.48]Uh... I don't think it's necessary, actually, because you're almost up.
[143:42.04]Yeah, they're gonna be fine.
[143:44.70]Another minute or two.
[143:47.08]Let me just go pee.
[143:49.62]I'll be right back.
[143:55.74]And we will.
[143:59.31]Actually, let's take a look.
[144:00.31]Is it time?
[144:00.81]No, not yet.
[144:04.67]Another hour or two and we'll do the New Year's Eve stuff.
[144:08.65]We'll get it prepared.
[144:11.25]But we're not done with the game quite yet.
[144:14.93]But I'll be right back.
[144:15.49]I'm going to take a piss.
[144:16.00]See you in a minute.
[146:23.68]Okay.
[146:27.59]So, yeah, let's go back to here.
[146:32.41]Very cool.
[146:36.63]Now we're guessing Jerma's height in inches.
[146:38.37]It's 69.
[146:38.86]I don't mean that as a funny, look at how funny that was joke.
[146:43.42]That's just how many inches tall I am.
[146:48.26]Okay.
[146:52.02]Back to it.
[147:01.85]How much more time do you need?
[147:02.93]Not very much for both of you.
[147:04.09]I'm going to take this opportunity to go buy... First aid and food again.
[147:09.90]Because... I have... These don't do very much.
[147:16.82]The nutrition is really not good.
[147:18.83]So... Let's go... Either... I need to go to... Should I... Alright.
[147:25.23]Here's the thing.
[147:27.91]Should I...
[147:33.26]Should I get gear?
[147:35.32]Should I actually have them put on real equipment?
[147:40.82]Should I get more first aid?
[147:48.58]Buy better backpacks?
[147:52.08]Get another companion?
[147:53.37]Get another person?
[147:57.89]Buy a house?
[148:01.37]I think I need a house.
[148:03.29]Because I need to reliably train somewhere.
[148:09.78]Because I can't keep walking up there.
[148:11.08]Hey, you're not supposed to be here.
[148:12.42]Get out of here.
[148:13.12]Alright, kill him now.
[148:18.40]Just get a house.
[148:20.53]What do you got in here?
[148:21.27]Alright, let's trade.
[148:31.95]What do you have?
[148:35.59]I'm not going to buy this shit.
[148:42.51]Mind Stone.
[148:43.23]Is my arm still screwed up?
[148:51.38]It is.
[148:51.62]I could buy the run-down building near me and then repair it.
[149:06.72]Let me go in here one more time.
[149:07.70]I want to see.
[149:08.20]I need the traveling store.
[149:10.28]No.
[149:10.74]Traveling store.
[149:13.42]Traveling man.
[149:15.54]Where is it?
[149:15.94]Traveling.
[149:19.26]Not this one.
[149:20.46]Where is it?
[149:23.55]There's an inn.
[149:24.65]A bar.
[149:25.11]What the hell?
[149:27.15]Is this a bank?
[149:31.21]Bank?
[149:31.47]Bank?
[149:39.64]General store.
[149:42.31]Rob a bank.
[149:43.71]I'm like, I can't rob a bank.
[149:46.55]I'm looking for that traveler.
[149:52.35]So I can buy the backpacks.
[149:56.47]Where's the backpack store?
[149:58.19]I'm going to take a look in here and see what's in it.
[150:09.92]Almost up.
[150:10.90]They're both almost up.
[150:15.84]Invest.
[150:16.42]Do I need people to talk to?
[150:17.66]Welcome, customer.
[150:19.64]Trade goods.
[150:20.08]Let's see what you got.
[150:21.36]Why am I running all the way around?
[150:26.24]Simple rug.
[150:28.58]Fabric.
[150:30.96]Straw flower.
[150:31.94]Water.
[150:34.40]Research.
[150:39.51]Well, here's some basic first aid kits.
[150:43.65]Look at that price markup, though.
[150:50.32]Get a... Get it?
[150:53.86]No.
[150:57.01]That's too much, right? 112%?
[151:08.79]Travel stores on the other side of town.
[151:10.33]Quality?
[151:10.79]5 out of 100.
[151:13.87]Why are you... These... Those are so bad.
[151:16.35]Let me just see if there's any others.
[151:30.66]Other side of town.
[151:33.37]So, like, over here?
[151:40.52]And that's the food store, right?
[151:47.50]There is the traveler.
[151:48.46]Alright.
[151:50.44]Get in there.
[151:58.30]I want to be banned.
[151:59.28]Ban me.
[152:00.36]Ban me.
[152:00.80]You won't.
[152:02.78]What are you guys doing?
[152:06.00]Why would I ban you?
[152:06.80]What are you talking about?
[152:09.64]Alright, this is important.
[152:10.78]I need to make sure I get this right.
[152:12.14]Because these are expensive.
[152:14.30]So... Large backpack.
[152:19.23]This backpack is huge.
[152:20.65]Don't even think about fighting with this on your back.
[152:23.05]The thing weighs a ton just when it's empty.
[152:25.27]Do you seriously think you can fill it full of iron or something and be able to lift it?
[152:28.93]Let alone carry it across the desert.
[152:31.21]Go get a smaller one.
[152:37.10]Trader's wooden backpack.
[152:39.94]A wooden backpack with a built-in sunshade.
[152:41.66]It's the height of luxury for the traveling trader.
[152:53.97]Traders' backpacks stack items.
[152:57.85]Okay.
[152:59.68]So I should get three of these.
[153:01.44]How much are they?
[153:01.98]400?
[153:02.12]Can the dog have a backpack?
[153:04.24]Can the dog have a small backpack?
[153:05.26]Okay.
[153:13.30]But look at this reduction.
[153:17.45]Only one person should have a backpack.
[153:24.79]Get rid of the dog already.
[153:34.56]Alright, this one's 400.
[153:35.10]I'm going to buy it.
[153:39.44]So I got this one.
[153:41.60]Let's see.
[153:42.24]I'm going to go like this.
[153:54.07]You can just drop a backpack before every fight.
[153:56.11]That kind of scares the shit out of me, though.
[154:01.74]Okay, so that's... Now...
[154:08.00]That's a smaller backpack.
[154:11.61]How much, what's a full stack?
[154:17.99]What is it, 10, 20 for a full stack?
[154:29.17]64.
[154:31.45]What if I do backpack inside the backpack?
[154:33.71]Now, that, I'm not doing Diablo II for Roger Q bullshit.
[154:40.63]I could sell this.
[154:45.91]No, that's alright for now.
[154:46.77]No... What about these boots?
[154:50.78]Drifter's boots.
[154:52.64]Blunt resistance, cut resistance.
[154:54.22]These are pretty good.
[154:57.78]Only 149.
[155:00.69]Athletics effect, let's see.
[155:03.49]Coverage, right leg, left leg, stealth effect is worse.
[155:14.99]Athletic effect.
[155:16.83]So the sandals give you combat speed and run speed.
[155:21.94]Whereas these are actual protection.
[155:29.76]I can keep both of them.
[155:32.06]How many pairs do I want?
[155:34.17]So these are plated long boots.
[155:36.93]These are less.
[155:37.57]These are worth less.
[155:38.35]Okay.
[155:39.81]So harpoon resistance.
[155:41.45]They're a little worse, but...
[155:45.07]Oh, it's just a high grade.
[155:47.17]Standard grade, high grade, I get it.
[155:52.71]Save money?
[155:54.44]Save money for a house?
[155:55.34]Yeah.
[155:56.90]That's probably... I need food and shit too, and I don't want to go broke, so... What is this thing?
[156:10.00]I really am wearing the Nintendo Labo.
[156:15.96]Almost up!
[156:19.40]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[156:20.24]Hold on.
[156:20.80]I wanted to go in the other building here, because this is the... I wanted to go in one of the bars of the food store or something.
[156:26.64]Right, let's just go in the bar.
[156:33.71]There's some people in here, too.
[156:34.61]I could get another companion.
[156:35.87]I could have four.
[156:41.42]Human mercenary.
[156:43.06]Wanna hire a bodyguard.
[156:44.04]2,000 per day.
[156:46.48]Get outta here.
[156:49.16]Where's the chump that can do it for... Plastic surgeon.
[156:55.31]You can redo how you look, no thanks.
[156:59.29]Gecko!
[157:01.47]I'm not too forward speaking to you, brother, but you're from the outside, right?
[157:05.11]I'm looking for work outside the city.
[157:06.53]How much are you charging?
[157:08.45]Just the standard 3,000 cats.
[157:12.63]Should I get Gekko?
[157:14.95]3-4?
[157:20.29]New friend?
[157:20.83]Done.
[157:26.96]Alright.
[157:30.44]A new band of Outlaws.
[157:44.94]Do you come with a weapon?
[157:56.03]Oh lord.
[157:56.65]No, I'm making like an old hookah.
[158:14.90]Very tall?
[158:31.88]Oh, God.
[158:32.74]No, no, no.
[158:33.40]I like that, by the way, better.
[158:41.62]No, that's not okay.
[158:43.50]That's too much.
[158:53.45]Just tiny legs.
[158:54.69]No, huge legs.
[159:02.57]I'm making a Chadette.
[159:14.01]Chadette.
[159:15.11]That's not a bad name.
[159:17.53]Hold on.
[159:31.23]I have, like, a drip tray underneath my chin.
[159:37.85]Okay.
[159:38.87]Now we're making, like, Jabba the Hutt.
[159:48.06]Big head?
[159:49.46]Big Chad head?
[159:52.40]Big Chadette head.
[159:58.34]No, small head.
[159:59.30]Tiny head.
[160:03.29]Cheeks.
[160:05.88]Mouth size.
[160:08.78]Mouth width.
[160:10.40]That's fine.
[160:11.14]That looks alright.
[160:21.98]Nose position.
[160:25.13]That is weird.
[160:26.89]No.
[160:28.15]This one.
[160:30.81]Uh...
[160:54.69]Making schnoz well.
[161:10.80]What about the other way?
[161:12.00]What does it look like?
[161:12.66]No, I think I like it right here.
[161:18.03]Right here.
[161:19.49]Brow position.
[161:21.45]Up.
[161:22.01]Brow tilt.
[161:22.59]Like that.
[161:26.34]Eyes depth all the way in.
[161:30.94]Eye narrow.
[161:35.09]Eye closeness.
[161:39.49]Get a good eye tilt.
[161:43.09]Eye height.
[161:48.22]Eye size.
[161:59.61]Jaw.
[162:01.27]Chin depth all the way out.
[162:05.80]Big chin.
[162:10.50]Wide chin.
[162:11.34]It's Adam Sandler.
[162:40.13]Uh... Madame!
[162:47.04]Madame Sandler!
[162:49.70]Ugh!
[163:17.59]Give anime hair?
[163:23.64]Well, if you're part of the frog team, you gotta have green hair.
[163:26.86]That's very important.
[163:44.23]Can I get a full view here?
[163:45.27]Oh, man.
[163:53.79]How tall is this though?
[163:55.47]Is this going to be obnoxious?
[164:07.20]Max leg length.
[164:09.06]I don't think I can do that.
[164:11.45]Where's leg length?
[164:21.94]No, this is fine.
[164:25.68]Leg... Click confirm.
[164:34.42]I need a name.
[164:44.69]Madam Sandler.
[164:46.39]Chadette is really good too, though.
[164:53.12]But now it doesn't even look anything like Adam Sandler.
[165:10.88]That doesn't even look like Adam Sandler.
[165:30.46]How's that?
[165:31.30]I got a middle name.
[165:38.09]Chatham Madam Sandler.
[165:48.30]This is, oh my god.
[165:49.50]Alright, what about...
[166:07.70]I don't know if I want to confirm this.
[166:09.26]We have to live with this for a long time.
[166:10.96]This is not just like today or tomorrow.
[166:15.83]All the way back?
[166:18.91]Yeah.

[170:20.99]I'm just gonna take them.
[170:21.71]I'm gonna take them.

[171:17.33]I can't.
[171:17.81]Okay.
[171:17.91]Alright, how much are building materials?
[171:29.16]Building materials, they are... I need three.
[171:36.64]One, two, three.
[171:39.77]How much money do I got?
[171:40.93]Those are fucking 85.

[171:42.85]Alright, got building materials.

[172:47.79]New house.
[172:49.25]Everybody get in.
[172:51.09]We're going to put beds in here.
[172:52.11]I finally have an actual location.
[172:57.55]So now what?
[172:59.71]I guess I can build...
[173:03.17]Uh, lights.
[173:04.15]Torch post.
[173:05.75]Okay.
[173:06.05]Let's put two in here.
[173:08.44]Oh, I need more building materials.
[173:17.62]Buy some sleeping bags.
[173:19.06]Okay, what else can I... Private.
[173:24.12]Small shack.
[173:27.80]Alright, so I can do... What else can I do?
[173:30.40]Buildings.
[173:31.86]Camping.
[173:33.16]Farming.
[173:33.74]Vegetable farm.
[173:34.62]Lights.
[173:35.04]Mining.
[173:35.84]Tech.
[173:36.68]Small research bench.
[173:38.78]A research bench is vital to enabling new weapons and technologies.
[173:41.84]This little one will fit in a small shack and is good for getting started.
[173:45.53]I need three building materials.
[173:49.25]That's going to go right here.
[173:54.13]So, I need some building materials.
[173:55.97]I need three more.
[173:57.78]Go get it.
[174:01.50]How much is a bed?
[174:03.14]What do I need for beds?
[174:05.50]Tech, mining, lights, farming, camping.
[174:08.39]Camp bed.
[174:10.55]Need... Three or four sleeping bags?
[174:15.41]How do I turn or tilt an item?
[174:18.45]How do I rotate?
[174:22.66]He doesn't even... I don't know how to rotate.
[174:34.91]So this is going to go, hold on, I need to redo this.
[174:41.09]Dismantle, because I didn't even do anything yet.
[174:42.67]Dismantle.
[174:44.94]Let's block this out.
[174:48.22]You guys get out of the way.
[174:54.71]Tech.
[174:55.51]Research bench.
[174:57.07]Get it right against this wall.
[174:59.05]No, I think I want it over here.
[175:00.67]This thing is so huge.
[175:05.27]Because you can't even open the door.
[175:06.53]That is the entryway.
[175:09.21]Sleeping beds will be back there.
[175:10.35]So I'll spin this around this way up against this wall.
[175:16.45]Can I get it here?
[175:18.54]No, you've got to get out of the way, man.
[175:21.64]Everybody get out.
[175:23.48]Everybody out.
[175:36.81]Alright, that looks good.
[175:40.51]It's kind of in the way, but it's alright.
[175:43.19]Flush against the wall.
[175:47.73]Stop the bees.
[175:50.02]I can't stop the bees.
[175:51.86]They're just in the game.
[175:52.62]Alright, so I need camping camp bed.
[176:09.29]You got an issue with this placement game?
[176:11.55]What's wrong?
[176:16.07]One.
[176:17.63]Two.
[176:19.39]Three.
[176:22.29]Three's fine.
[176:26.09]Alright, three sleeping bags.
[176:28.15]Three building material.
[176:30.54]Go to town and get it.
[176:36.02]General store.
[176:39.56]Oh shit, it's closed.
[176:43.99]When do they open?
[177:16.68]She's building up her lockpicking.
[177:18.44]It's fine.
[177:21.42]I thought the dog could see me do this, but... Holy shit, this person doesn't see me doing this.
[177:31.98]Well, that's good.
[177:39.70]I want to make sure people have skills.
[177:48.69]Save?
[177:49.03]I already did.
[177:49.95]I saved right when I got to the front door.
[177:52.84]I hit F5 right when I got to the front door.
[178:05.18]That's okay.
[178:05.80]You can see me, but that's fine.
[178:06.88]Doesn't matter.
[178:12.01]I'll do it again.
[178:37.31]What is this thing?
[178:38.07]Whoa, what are you... Alright, alright.
[178:41.93]You could see me, but you're doing something else.
[178:48.01]Did the great Canadian FK Club just come in with another 10 community subs?
[178:54.30]Oh my goodness.
[178:57.30]Thank you so much, Canadian FK Club.
[179:05.44]Add it to your... How many do you have at this point?
[179:13.16]I didn't catch it.
[179:14.12]How many committee subs do you have now?
[179:21.82]It's gotta be at least... Like 40 or 50 or more.
[179:26.60]I think I got it.
[179:27.18]Okay, I got it.
[179:29.89]That's fine.
[179:30.33]You can see me.
[179:31.15]I'm not doing anything.
[179:33.91]I'm not doing anything.
[179:38.33]Thank you, dude.
[179:39.51]Really.
[179:42.37]I'm gonna save it up here.
[179:48.27]Make the main character a master thief.
[179:51.10]Yeah, but just in case something happens... You know, let's just say... This is not a person.
[180:01.26]They're not gonna care.
[180:01.92]Alright, here we go.
[180:05.61]Let's take a look.
[180:07.11]Building material...
[180:10.38]So there's one for free.
[180:16.46]Building material.
[180:19.99]Stone.
[180:23.73]Fabric, steel bars.
[180:24.95]Let's get the steel bars.
[180:26.61]Who are you?
[180:30.84]I thought the guy was upstairs.
[180:35.10]I thought he was upstairs.
[180:35.98]I thought the guy was sleeping upstairs.
[180:38.28]Whatever.
[180:51.19]Go in there and kill him?
[180:51.96]Why would I do that?
[181:37.14]No, 30%.
[181:38.38]Nothing just sitting around here?
[181:43.00]I gotta leave.
[181:46.96]I got one.
[181:47.42]And then he's gonna get up and I'm gonna walk in the door.
[181:51.66]Shit!
[181:52.08]What time is it?
[181:52.98]5?
[181:53.50]Oh shit!
[182:01.43]Alright, I can't go upstairs.
[182:09.32]Keep playing.
[182:10.12]Re.
[182:17.80]I'm going to get this one for free because I know I can get it.
[182:20.20]And I'm going to leave and then just do it.
[182:31.04]Still night time.
[182:31.84]I got it.
[182:32.64]Get out.
[182:43.74]Okay.
[182:44.78]The whole purpose was to come over here and get this stuff, so... I don't need to sneak anymore.
[182:51.50]Hey, look at that.
[182:52.10]Save.
[182:54.38]Steel bars?
[182:55.16]I can't.
[182:58.91]When does this door open?
[183:04.25]Five minutes.
[183:07.21]Six AM, right?
[183:16.37]Steal the door.
[183:19.38]You can't steal the door.
[183:20.64]6 a.m.
[183:20.96]Hey!
[183:21.32]I have some things I'd like to buy.
[183:24.34]My favorite customer.
[183:25.50]That's me.
[183:27.16]How are you?
[183:29.54]Building materials.
[183:31.26]One, two, and I also need... Oh, sleeping bags.
[183:37.94]You don't have them.
[183:45.10]I think I have to go to the other part of town.
[183:47.41]But that's fine.
[183:48.17]Thank you for that.
[183:49.79]At least I can build the research bench.
[183:54.71]What's everybody doing over here?
[184:02.78]So let's get some of you guys to work.
[184:10.06]No, get up there.
[184:14.30]And then you go get the sleeping bags.
[184:16.92]How long is that going to take?
[184:18.16]Not very long.
[184:18.96]Where's the dog?
[184:22.69]Oh, in my arms still.
[184:23.59]Okay.
[184:24.33]Alright, Frog must go to the Adventurer's Store.
[184:29.95]Which is down here.
[184:43.70]Welcome back.
[184:45.28]Building small research bench is complete.
[184:47.08]Let's get... Why do they always do this?
[184:51.66]Sleeping bags.
[184:56.76]Uh... Sleeping bags?
[185:10.66]I don't see any sleeping bags.
[185:13.53]You're too short to talk over the counter.
[185:17.22]I mean, that makes sense.
[185:24.33]Well, you don't have any.
[185:29.54]Alright, how to research tech.
[185:30.90]To learn new tech, you can buy blueprints from merchants, or you can research the tech yourself.
[185:35.67]To research, you must have a scientist assigned to your research bench.
[185:39.91]Select a squad member, hold right-click on your research bench, and select Use Machine.
[185:45.01]Research speed will depend on your assigned scientist's science skill stat.
[185:50.80]That is a tongue twister.
[185:53.06]Assigned scientist's science skill stat.
[185:55.44]Assigned scientist's science skill stat.
[185:59.49]Next, you need to select tech to research.
[186:01.13]Select tech from the panel.
[186:02.93]Select any tech you want to research.
[186:03.97]By left-clicking it, you can queue up as many as you want.
[186:08.09]So somebody kind of has to stay back here and do that.
[186:11.18]The question is, who?
[186:14.34]I'm going to say Kant Roth.
[186:17.84]My original character is terrible.
[186:21.02]The dog can't do it.
[186:26.10]The dog cannot be a scientist.
[186:28.46]I'm sorry, guys.
[186:35.94]Can the dog be a scientist?
[186:40.70]No.
[186:41.78]Dog cannot be scientist.
[186:44.24]I can be a scientist.
[186:48.39]Hold on.
[186:48.77]Let me look at the stats here.
[186:52.29]So we got... Chatham Madam... Is... Default for everything.
[187:01.92]Brand new character.
[187:02.88]Frog Musk is...
[187:06.62]The labor medic... Labor medic, ah... Kanroth is... Huge labor athletics.
[187:17.14]Huge in... I think he just... I think Kanroth is just going to have to be the... The one that does all the stuff that has nothing to do with fighting.
[187:31.31]Strength 28.
[187:31.61]10, 1...
[187:37.94]Or, I don't know.
[187:41.98]You should mine.
[187:42.86]I need another character.
[187:49.53]I need another character.
[187:50.61]I need to go buy another character to be a scientist.
[187:56.75]Alright, I'm going to go buy a scientist.
[188:03.91]I'll be back.
[188:09.85]Everybody hang out.
[188:10.53]I gotta find another person to be in the squad.
[188:22.15]Let's go with the bar.
[188:23.57]Let's go with this one.
[188:24.27]Start at the end.
[188:28.67]If you're searching, I'm a bit of a scientist myself.
[188:33.01]That's alright, though.
[188:33.69]I mean...
[188:39.67]Plastic surgeon.
[188:40.55]No, nobody in this one.
[188:45.66]Check the other ones.
[188:52.12]A lot of people in here.
[188:53.00]Ends of fence?
[188:55.00]No.
[188:55.20]A lot of people.
[188:57.49]Thief.
[189:01.21]Thief, fence.
[189:02.35]Do I have any stolen stuff to sell?
[189:05.19]No.
[189:07.37]Alright, which one of you...
[189:10.42]Human mercenary.
[189:13.62]No, none of you are.
[189:16.92]What upstairs?
[189:20.00]No.
[189:22.88]None of you want to come with me.
[189:30.92]So that's these two bars.
[189:32.48]Checked.
[189:34.52]Are there any more bars?
[189:38.50]What about in here?
[189:48.58]Who are you?
[189:49.52]Holy servant.
[189:51.74]Let's do business.
[189:53.62]Oh, food.
[189:55.67]Yeah, I need food.
[189:56.57]Just already ate it.
[189:59.63]Bread?
[190:00.05]No, it's too much money.
[190:02.31]Why do that when I can just take it?
[190:03.69]Honest to God.
[190:07.44]Raw meat.
[190:08.34]Cooked vegetables.
[190:11.22]Dried fish.
[190:12.60]Dried fish.
[190:13.32]It's so expensive.
[190:17.99]Make Willem Dafoe.
[190:25.41]Anybody up here?
[190:28.55]Nobody up here.
[190:29.69]God damn it.
[190:35.01]Well, I need to find somebody to purchase first.
[190:40.10]Those are... both empty of people.
[190:45.24]What about down here?
[190:56.03]You.
[190:57.25]No.
[191:01.17]Barman.
[191:03.71]No.
[191:06.50]I can't afford to make another character?
[191:07.92]I for- No, maybe I don't.
[191:11.50]I did spend a lot of money.
[191:12.40]I don't want to go broke.
[191:14.74]Somebody's gonna have to stay back and be a scientist.
[191:18.08]And it can't be the dog.
[191:30.72]More.
[191:31.10]I just got a new character.
[191:35.74]You know what?
[191:36.24]I'm going to stay back.
[191:37.32]Frog Musky is going to stay back.
[191:39.76]For now.
[191:41.50]Look at his arm.
[191:42.12]His arm is still all screwed up.
[191:43.30]He can't do much right now.
[191:44.92]I'm going to have a splint.
[191:49.29]He just needs rest.
[191:50.07]Use.
[191:54.61]Use.
[191:58.73]Show research.
[192:00.67]Gear storage, item storage, public sales.
[192:05.25]Crafting.
[192:07.23]Two hours.
[192:07.73]I need a book.
[192:09.53]Farming industry training.
[192:11.65]Simple training dummies.
[192:12.85]I need two books.
[192:15.79]What do you mean books?
[192:25.85]Storage box or storage box.
[192:35.75]Things will go a lot smoother if we organize an efficient method to store and distribute our raw material.
[192:39.79]Otherwise, things are going to get jammed up.
[192:43.04]Storage or storage steel bars, steel iron plates, copper.
[192:49.94]Books are next door.
[192:54.05]There's so much going on here.
[193:01.69]You sell books?
[193:07.67]What do you got?
[193:09.23]Okay, book.
[193:11.39]A book from the University of Machinists.
[193:14.41]Everything they need, they learn, is compiled in the books, like this one.
[193:18.84]So, I just have to buy book.
[193:21.98]That's it.
[193:24.00]Nothing else.
[193:24.64]Just book.
[193:28.76]Steal it.
[193:35.56]There's nothing here to take.
[193:48.89]Stealing is bad.
[193:49.91]I'm just going to buy the books.
[193:51.21]How many do I need?
[193:51.77]Three?
[193:52.27]Two?
[193:53.09]I need the training dummy.
[193:54.13]Three books?
[193:55.62]Was it two or three?
[194:02.90]Because that's three, six, nine.
[194:08.65]Three, six, nine.
[194:12.85]Because I'm going to need these other stuff too, right?
[194:22.44]Three for lockpicking training.
[194:24.24]Two for... Okay.
[194:32.36]So that's... I need five.
[194:37.16]Alright.
[194:38.85]That's all I'm going to do right now.
[194:40.07]So I can at least... I can do lockpicking practice.
[194:47.25]Let's get done.
[194:48.49]Frog's going to stay back.
[194:49.35]His arm is all messed up.
[194:53.98]So, use.
[194:56.32]So, research.
[194:58.45]Training.
[194:58.89]What...
[195:30.35]Okay.
[195:30.89]Simple training dummies.
[195:35.09]Damn, rookies are useless.
[195:36.47]Keep getting beat up because they can't hit anything.
[195:38.51]A basic training dummy would let them train their attack skills up to about level five.
[195:45.12]And then... Learning to pick locks is hard.
[195:48.04]To get started, it's too late to learn once you're locked in a cage.
[195:50.81]Training is needed to get your foot in the ladder.
[195:52.19]Okay.
[195:54.11]Get it.
[195:56.29]Three hours.
[196:03.30]Lock picking three hours?
[196:05.18]Like, real time or in game time?
[196:10.50]Who's working on this?
[196:15.41]Am I working on this?
[196:17.57]Engineering, right?
[196:21.99]Science?
[196:22.96]Okay.
[196:24.18]He's got it.
[196:35.94]So where can I put the training dummy?
[196:37.26]I want privacy.
[196:43.59]So we've got, show the research.
[196:45.27]Alright, let's speed it up.
[196:49.29]Wait, we can all do it at the same time, right?
[196:56.13]Use.
[196:59.20]Use.
[197:01.18]No?
[197:03.46]No, only one person can be here, okay.
[197:06.90]Only one at each bench.
[197:09.31]So we do just kind of have to sit here.
[197:11.61]Sit here!
[197:14.97]There's a huge fight going on and I'm not seeing it?
[197:18.51]Where?
[197:25.60]Huge fight?
[197:37.48]There's nobody out here.
[197:38.18]I didn't get baited, did I?
[197:51.69]Almost done.
[197:55.15]There's no dog bed?
[197:56.61]Well, that's alright.
[198:04.47]Who's training science?
[198:06.51]It is Frog Musk is the one that's doing it.
[198:11.05]Specifically because Frog Musk is currently very injured.
[198:14.51]And it's going to take a while for them to heal.
[198:16.60]Alright, we got a training dummy.
[198:21.98]Whoa, whoa, hey, why are you doing that?
[198:23.16]Oh, because I moved him.
[198:26.86]So now build.
[198:28.08]Let's just see what happens here.
[198:29.25]Build.
[198:31.65]Training dummy.
[198:33.63]I need four iron plates.
[198:35.65]Shit.
[198:36.07]What if I put them outside?
[198:37.15]Oh man, this is such a small shack.
[198:40.43]I can't put them anywhere.
[198:44.15]Where am I gonna put this?
[198:48.27]It's gonna have to go right next to the beds.
[198:56.28]Make a second floor.
[198:57.46]I can't afford that.
[199:02.22]So I need four iron plates.
[199:08.27]Now, all of you leave it alone.
[199:09.67]Frog Musk is the one that's going to be using it.
[199:18.97]The rest of you are going to have to go on a mission here.
[199:28.66]There's the autosave.
[199:31.94]These buildings are unexpandable.
[199:33.28]Okay.
[199:36.47]So I have this group here.
[199:42.97]I need... I need to think of where the hell I want to go from here.
[199:47.29]Because I have... I need food.
[199:50.93]So I'm going to stock up on some food.
[199:55.63]Buy another shack.
[199:59.43]Take the backpack from Musk.
[200:02.80]I'll leave the dog here.
[200:03.96]No, but the dog is fine now.
[200:05.19]The dog has actual damage.
[200:10.73]I'm going to say from here, we're going to just explore down here.
[200:13.39]I want to see what's over here.
[200:15.13]We'll go with the three of them.
[200:19.20]So that would... Yeah, let's get some food.
[200:21.00]Let's make a... Frogmust does not have any jobs, right?
[200:28.36]Go mine some rocks.
[200:30.09]Go look for stuff.
[200:30.97]Maybe another town.
[200:33.89]Lock your door before you go.
[200:35.01]Well, Frogmust is going to be in here.
[200:39.26]So, you.
[200:40.82]Follow.
[200:42.48]Bodyguard.
[200:43.54]You.
[200:44.96]Bodyguard.
[200:46.16]You.
[200:47.22]Everybody walk together.
[200:48.92]You got it.
[200:51.79]Time to... Let's close the door.
[201:02.51]Uh, don't I have it set to they move together?
[201:05.69]Why is it going so much faster?
[201:11.05]Alright, food.
[201:13.10]Close the door on your way out.
[201:14.28]He'll be fine.
[201:17.52]Backpack!
[201:18.24]Shit!
[201:25.15]Trade!
[201:25.69]Give me your backpack.
[201:28.29]There is a little bit of food and some... Ugh, goddammit.
[201:35.07]Okay, so I need to... This is Frog Musk.
[201:43.09]Give that to Canned Roth.
[201:45.82]And Frog Musk, you just put that on.
[201:48.38]It doesn't matter.
[201:52.36]Maybe I should give the other backpack to Madam.
[201:59.84]Yeah, okay.
[202:00.58]Alright, we're ready.
[202:23.34]47, 1.2.
[202:23.62]Uh, this is actually... This katana's better.
[202:28.91]Attack bonus.
[202:33.29]Yeah, this thing's terrible.
[202:42.66]Alright.
[202:44.00]Let's do it.
[202:48.70]Close the door.
[202:51.98]It's time to go buy supplies.
[203:02.53]So I'm going to say, let's go to the bar.
[203:04.59]I need to buy a couple of things of food.
[203:06.23]We're not going to go very far.
[203:07.17]I just need to go far enough to get some money.
[203:12.05]I need iron.
[203:13.08]What if I need iron bars or something?
[203:28.66]Let's trade.
[203:29.24]Here we go.
[203:34.32]And I'm going to get two of these.
[203:39.95]We need it.
[203:40.33]We're going to go out.
[203:42.45]I know I just spent all my money, but it's necessary.
[203:44.27]I'm going to get it all back.
[203:45.05]Don't worry.
[203:45.49]I need four steel plates.
[203:52.58]Out into the wilderness we go, which is down here.
[203:55.40]Good luck!
[203:59.64]Are there no quest givers in this game?
[204:01.10]There are not.
[204:03.58]This is a... Where am I going?
[204:08.23]This is a sandbox RPG.
[204:12.05]There are quest givers?
[204:12.91]Where?
[204:13.21]What?
[204:23.68]Why does this guy have three and a half thousand viewers?
[204:28.00]Hey, stop pretending like you just got here.
[204:29.96]I see the sub.
[204:31.46]I see that you're a sub.
[204:35.41]You can't like pretend like you just got here.
[204:37.51]Gifted sub.
[204:58.10]Come on, that's like going to the movies.
[205:00.68]And you're about to go see... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[205:04.34]A better example.
[205:05.03]That's like going to a restaurant.
[205:07.35]It's a restaurant that you like.
[205:08.99]You've eaten at this restaurant before.
[205:11.67]You sit down.
[205:12.23]You order the food.
[205:14.05]The food starts to come out.
[205:14.95]And the whole time you're going like, Why does this restaurant suck?
[205:18.87]Why does this restaurant have four stars on Yelp?
[205:20.80]This place is awful.
[205:22.28]They bring out the food.
[205:23.02]You cut into it.
[205:23.56]You eat the first piece of steak.
[205:25.50]Oh, boy.
[205:28.84]Who comes here?
[205:31.26]Why would you ever sit here and eat this?
[205:33.56]You know, can I talk to the manager?
[205:35.10]The manager comes out, it's me.
[205:36.68]Yeah, hey, how are you?
[205:38.02]Hey, did you make this steak?
[205:40.24]I did, did you like it?
[205:41.44]Yes.
[205:42.32]But fuck this place, it sucks.
[205:45.17]Okay.
[205:54.23]The manager, why am I running so much faster?
[206:00.45]I have the, like, don't I have the thing where we all work together?
[206:02.93]Is somebody sneaking?
[206:18.99]Um, excuse me, somebody said, why did you say a five-star steak?
[206:22.90]I said four.
[206:24.72]I said a four-star steak.
[206:26.24]I didn't say five.
[206:27.76]Hold on, we got a problem.
[206:31.76]This thing sucks.
[206:33.90]I should be able to handle this.
[206:39.84]Is there like a mother around?
[206:40.84]These are pups.
[206:44.46]There's only a few of them.
[206:45.82]Pups?
[206:46.24]Pups only have three attack.
[206:50.29]That's an adult.
[207:03.66]They're not faster than us, though, are they?
[207:07.55]Can I outrun them?
[207:16.15]Uh, I'm matching their speed.
[207:20.23]Oh, fuck.
[207:20.99]Is this acid rain?
[207:26.38]They left.
[207:26.80]Okay.
[207:27.26]I'm in acid rain right now, I think.
[207:28.70]Is this blood?
[207:30.92]What is this?
[207:34.02]Discovered Hive Village.
[207:36.51]Where?
[207:46.00]Uh, everybody's fine.
[208:04.00]Hive Village.
[208:04.96]That's where we're going.
[208:06.88]Hope they're friendly.
[208:12.16]Buy that shack?
[208:13.18]No, I'm not going to buy the shack.
[208:32.97]Save it here.
[208:38.43]I'm looking for a vane.
[208:39.33]I just need a vane.
[208:42.37]A vane, preferably, that can have two people on it.
[208:47.32]What was that?
[208:48.66]So, you know, we gotta get one of them lanterns while we're in vane.
[208:54.27]Lanterns?
[208:57.91]Lanterns?
[208:58.27]What lanterns?
[209:01.36]You know, the lanterns... Them lanterns of radiance.
[209:04.14]It would be like going to the swamps and not buying drugs or fish.
[209:07.61]Why do you want drugs?
[209:12.11]What am I stuck on?
[209:17.75]You gotta buy a lantern.
[209:20.77]You mean lantern of radiance.
[209:23.92]Alright, stick with it.
[209:24.64]Stick together, please.
[209:29.02]Yeah, yeah.
[209:29.78]Lantern of rodents.
[209:34.20]Somebody ate raw meat.
[209:35.62]That's not good.
[209:38.86]Why would you eat the raw meat?
[209:41.64]There's food in there already.
[209:50.82]It was the dog.
[209:52.66]I bet the dog likes raw meat better.
[210:03.53]Uh...
[210:05.75]Does this hit?
[210:13.79]Are there bug people here?
[210:20.26]I feel like there are bugs here.
[210:27.12]Is this a store?
[210:28.30]This is a store.
[210:31.04]Hold on.
[210:33.62]Open to the public.
[210:34.71]Hive.
[210:42.47]How do we get in?
[210:54.11]Hello?
[211:02.48]Okay.
[211:03.40]Well, let's go to... What are you going to sell?
[211:10.25]There are a few stores.
[211:12.61]Store.
[211:13.19]There's a store over there.
[211:16.49]What's that?
[211:17.73]Copper.
[211:18.59]And there are two workers available for that.
[211:21.90]Hey, see you in two hours when I get this thing clean.
[211:25.30]Who owns this?
[211:26.52]No faction?
[211:27.26]Get it.
[211:42.35]It's 100 quality as well.
[211:59.19]Price markup.
[212:01.35]Can I stack these?
[212:02.63]Yes, I can.
[212:03.11]That's going to be this.
[212:09.31]This is what we're doing here.
[212:12.51]You know what?
[212:12.83]I got an idea.
[212:13.59]So now that... Now that we have a minute here.
[212:18.65]A lot of minutes.
[212:23.12]Check on Musk.
[212:27.58]Well, they will stack in here, right?
[212:31.18]What's wrong with them?
[212:48.29]Why did you stop doing this?
[212:53.85]He has no food.
[212:59.46]I locked him in the house and said, work on it.
[213:02.66]I took his clothes and his food.
[213:06.44]He's standing in the dark.
[213:18.03]Ayayay.
[213:19.19]He'll be alright.
[213:21.49]I'll just go buy him a snack right now.
[213:28.07]Hungry.
[213:34.01]Standing naked in an empty room.
[213:36.57]Work on it.
[213:38.49]Put... Work on what, sir?
[213:43.79]I'm gonna...
[213:46.25]Yeah, they're possessed by robots.
[213:50.89]Weird.
[213:51.11]Okay, I'm gonna go buy... I don't have any money.
[213:54.64]So, I can buy, like, one piece of beef jerky and that's it.
[213:59.76]Need to go to a bar that sells it.
[214:05.37]Um... I'm gonna say we'll try this one.
[214:18.40]I wonder what Barth is doing right now.
[214:21.96]That's a great question.
[214:22.78]Steal it.
[214:23.14]Alright, there's a can of cooked vegetables over here.
[214:35.28]It's very possible that I can sneak and get the can of cooked vegetables and just eat it.
[214:45.88]If I just wrap around here.
[215:06.89]Got it.
[215:19.33]Spread over here.
[215:25.56]A literal rat.
[215:41.45]I'm going to be just fine.
[215:42.49]I got plenty of food now.
[215:48.67]Getting that raw meat's pushing it.
[215:49.79]Alright, back to work over here.
[215:52.21]Lockpicking trainer.
[216:01.10]Which is in my house.
[216:04.18]Close the door behind you, lock it.
[216:13.54]What's wrong with me?
[216:17.57]Oh, my arm seems to have healed itself.
[216:20.53]That's good.
[216:20.91]Alright, so you got food.
[216:25.19]You got some bread.
[216:25.83]You got some grog.
[216:27.15]And cooked vegetables.
[216:28.23]You should be fine for a while.
[216:30.22]Back to work.
[216:33.24]Block picking training.
[216:34.08]Good.
[216:34.52]Let's check on this.
[216:38.02]Look at that.
[216:38.42]What does it say?
[216:40.28]Your machine is full.
[216:43.11]Your machine is full.
[216:43.79]Machines are buildings.
[216:44.70]I only have a maximum amount of materials I can hold after they've produced them.
[216:49.08]You won't be able to produce... Oh, this is technically a machine.
[216:52.94]Okay.
[217:03.54]Back to it.
[217:07.72]So five can be in there before I have to take it out.
[217:15.70]Close the door.
[217:18.20]He's fine in here.
[217:32.43]Lockpick training is done.
[217:41.88]I have so much room.
[217:43.85]This is going to be a lot.
[217:45.01]I'm going to have probably $20,000 or $30,000.
[217:46.61]That's very possible.
[218:02.62]They're just going to have to sit here all day.
[218:04.10]Forever.
[218:04.54]Forever.
[218:07.94]I'm sorry, they're going to be here forever.
[218:09.36]Because I'm going to get, like, 400 stacks.
[218:14.22]Alright, what else can we do?
[218:17.30]Use.
[218:18.94]Show research.
[218:19.94]Pause it.
[218:20.38]Don't just idle here.
[218:21.28]Don't be an idiot.
[218:23.91]Okay.
[218:24.63]Core.
[218:25.73]Gear storage.
[218:27.87]Doesn't require anything.
[218:29.99]Do it.
[218:31.19]Item storage.
[218:33.75]Public sales.
[218:34.73]It would save us a lot of running around to sell goods if we could just get the customers to come to us.
[218:41.74]Crafting.
[218:42.28]Defense.
[218:42.68]Electric.
[218:43.68]Storage boxes.
[218:44.74]This is no requirement.
[218:48.06]Just queue it up.
[218:49.24]Farming boxes.
[218:50.22]More storage.
[218:52.72]Smithing.
[218:53.20]Training.
[218:53.74]Alright.
[218:54.40]I got a huge queue here.
[218:56.14]You got enough food?
[218:59.82]You got enough food.
[219:01.65]Good luck.

[226:42.95]Why not?
[226:43.35]We're all just sitting here.
[226:46.11]So categories for the New Year's Eve stream will be... Obviously, we'll do... Let's just get them written down.
[226:53.11]Worst overall stream.
[226:58.15]Actually, I need to make this bigger.

[228:10.86]He's all the way over here.
[228:14.64]What's wrong with the dog?
[228:17.35]Did the dog get hurt?
[228:26.73]Who got hurt?
[228:29.49]He's alright.
[228:32.11]Okay, back to what you were doing.
[228:33.63]Pick up this stuff.
[228:37.85]No, what are you doing?
[228:38.81]Don't fight another, like, fucking slime monster!
[228:42.45]Run away!
[228:43.19]Let them do it!
[228:47.11]What are these things doing here?
[228:48.37]Now they're bleeding.
[228:49.33]Good thing there's a store right there.
[228:56.20]Maybe I can level up a little bit here.
[228:58.36]No?
[228:58.58]Okay, take it.
[228:59.10]Free.
[229:10.97]Okay, go back to what you're doing.
[229:16.25]Okay, we're good.
[229:17.53]You're still working on stuff, right?
[229:18.96]Yep, public sales.
[229:20.64]Okay, back to what we were doing again.
[229:23.26]I'm gonna stay here just in case that happens again.
[229:26.62]Two like abominable snowman's attack at the same time.
[229:28.86]Alright, zoom it out so I can see better.
[229:30.18]Okay, so worst chat experience.
[229:37.98]What stream it was, worst chat experience.
[229:42.05]I know I'm spelling these terribly, but that's fine.
[229:44.39]Worst overall stream, worst overall joke, worst hair, worst joke, taking more than five minutes, worst new character, worst chat experience.
[229:51.73]Worst noise.
[229:54.63]And I'll give you some examples, like... Like, whatever, you can nominate whatever you want from last year.
[230:08.18]Worst new meme...
[230:13.56]From 2018.
[230:17.60]Worst streamer.
[230:22.69]No, no, because I'm not gonna put other, I'm gonna just, that's gonna be my name on it.
[230:32.53]Alright, we gotta add some bests.
[230:34.40]Bests, okay, bests.
[230:36.44]Best overall use of cardboard, I would say.
[230:45.13]That sounds pretty good.
[230:52.86]Best flavor of ice cream.
[230:55.30]Okay.
[230:59.26]Make this a little smaller.
[231:11.49]Worst category.
[231:13.79]I like that.
[231:15.81]I don't know why.
[231:16.41]It's such a stupid thing.
[231:26.09]Spelled cat doesn't matter.
[231:27.27]So that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11.
[231:29.27]I want about 15.
[231:33.91]Worst stream, worst joke, worst hair, worst joke that took more than five minutes, worst character, worst chat experience.
[231:40.31]And that means what experience you had, right?
[231:44.03]We're talking like octagon, like, oh, how unbearable was that chat, right?
[231:51.50]You can nominate the worst chat experience.
[232:05.28]Best noise, best noise.
[232:07.47]Okay, so we got best, worst noise, best noise.
[232:25.54]Stop, no best characters.
[232:29.92]No, we gotta have worst new character.
[232:39.32]I think these are alright.
[232:40.60]Because remember, each one of these, I get to cut together a presentation for them.
[232:48.71]So for instance, so the nomination process, we've only got about a day to do this.
[232:58.00]So I'm, whatever, it's probably going to be about six to ten nominees.
[233:01.55]I'd say somewhere around six is probably good.
[233:04.23]And me and the mods are going to pick the nominees based on suggestions.
[233:08.67]Whatever ones, you know, if people are writing a bunch of the same one, people have different suggestions, the nominees are going to be put into the categories and we're going to be, I'm not going to be streaming over the next two days.
[233:18.12]This is very important.
[233:19.42]Very, very, very, very important.
[233:22.65]I am not going to be able to announce to you guys, hey, so you can vote now, go and vote, right?
[233:28.95]I'm not going to be able to do that.
[233:30.45]So just know, you got to know this.
[233:33.74]After today, you won't see me till New Year's Eve because I'm going to be working on this for the next two straight days.
[233:40.82]So the voting is going to happen today.
[233:44.15]off stream when I'm not there.
[233:45.99]You're just going to have to check in on the Discord over the next day or so.
[233:48.87]Because the categories are going to be up there.
[233:51.39]Nominations will stop tomorrow night.
[233:53.49]And the voting will stop not even probably 12 hours after that.
[233:59.32]Because then the whole next day I'm going to be working all day to cut up these presentations.
[234:07.16]So let's think about this.
[234:09.22]Worst stream, worst joke, worst hair.
[234:12.10]Best noise, best overall use of cardboard, best flavor of ice cream.
[234:20.86]Worst use of music and best use of music?
[234:26.46]Oh, hold on.
[234:28.54]I gotta get back over here and collect these.
[234:33.14]Oh, that doesn't stack.
[234:33.96]That's not a stacking backpack.
[234:35.24]Shit.
[234:37.28]Okay, that's good.
[234:38.00]How you doing, Frogmusk?
[234:43.87]I mean, okay, this worst... We could do... Who the hell is this?
[234:50.04]Is this the mechanical shop owner?
[234:54.52]Quick, get out there.
[234:55.20]Go, go, go.
[234:55.66]Get that stuff.
[235:01.63]Fuck!
[235:02.01]You did it right when I got there.
[235:03.71]Stick back in here.
[235:10.13]I mean, there's also, you can also do worst, okay, worst overall stream, worst overall joke.
[235:13.72]What about worst overall moment?
[235:16.16]Right?
[235:21.40]Close the door, I got it.
[235:31.83]Don't do too many categories.
[235:33.11]Yeah, I mean, because each category is going to take about five to ten minutes to get through them.
[235:40.60]Coming up with these on the fly?
[235:41.62]Oh yeah, because this came up less than four hours ago, five hours ago.
[235:46.22]And I got the studio time, so it's happening.
[235:51.10]Worst internet problem.
[235:53.42]That's a good one.
[235:56.08]That is a really good one, actually.
[236:03.38]Worst internet issue.
[236:12.72]Best internet?
[236:21.07]Worst overall stream.
[236:22.85]I don't think I want to do best overall stream because that's like, oh, what was the best stream?
[236:27.03]I want to know what the worst fucking stream was.
[236:35.56]Best clip?
[236:36.20]Alright, that's alright.
[236:41.54]Best clip?
[236:51.79]I think that's pretty good.
[236:53.99]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[237:05.76]That's just the most used clip, yeah.
[237:11.12]Uh, I got a better idea.
[237:12.16]Yeah, best clip is not gonna work out.
[237:16.84]Find that one for me, guys.
[237:27.47]Okay, here's the two categories that are coming up.
[237:38.16]I hate this category so much, but it's going out there.
[237:41.94]I've done it so many times that you could, like, very, I don't know.
[237:51.30]I'm gonna be up in a suit at the podium, like, going over these.
[237:54.44]We're gonna have to sit through and watch those.
[238:03.48]Alright, we can't get too crazy because I only have like I got a I'm gonna put in like triple time to make this a reality So I don't we got literally today into tomorrow afternoon To nominate and then from there forward Less than a day for voting So we really can't go this was just a last second idea that I thought was gonna be fun.
[238:30.24]So I
[238:35.74]Let me make sure that we got 15, right?
[238:37.30]Is it 15?
[238:38.10]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15!
[238:45.39]Biggest furry moment.
[238:46.59]What?
[238:46.73]That doesn't make any sense.
[238:55.26]How the mo- Oh, shit.
[238:56.16]I- You're right.
[238:56.90]Hold on.
[238:58.30]Alright, you're working back on this.
[238:59.74]You are.
[239:02.36]You guys are still mining.
[239:03.34]They got two.
[239:04.19]I'll stay back here again.
[239:05.17]Okay.
[239:09.79]Worst sweat?
[239:15.70]Has there been enough times where I've had sweat all over me on stream?
[239:30.55]Worst sweat?
[239:32.29]Okay.
[239:33.03]Yeah, I'll put it on there.
[239:38.86]So let's go with worst... Worst sweat... Or greasy moment.
[239:50.17]No, just worst... You get the idea.
[239:51.97]Worst sweat... Worst game?
[239:55.73]No, I don't... Worst game that's... Loudest scream.
[240:05.33]Well, the loudest scream doesn't work because all you have to do is just...
[240:08.83]Listen to which one was the loudest.
[240:15.36]Worst breakdown.
[240:18.44]On stream.
[240:19.06]That's a good one.
[240:21.66]Alright.
[240:22.00]I think we're good.
[240:22.60]I think we're good.
[240:23.06]This is a lot.
[240:23.90]This is a lot of categories.
[240:36.13]Best... Best gnome...
[240:42.17]No, what do you mean best gnome?
[240:43.61]No, I'm not going to do a best gnome.
[240:49.65]I got to put these back in a better place here.
[240:51.91]So we got best.
[240:54.44]Let's cut this.
[240:55.72]Because the best is going to be on a different section.
[240:57.94]You know what I'm saying?
[240:58.72]This is going to be like this.
[241:01.62]Anything that's worst has to be... I don't want that many best.
[241:09.07]Okay, so it's all worst, worst, worst, worst, worst.
[241:16.31]Get that here.
[241:21.85]I can't wait to do this one.
[241:24.11]I can't wait to do the worst Peter and best Peter on New Year's Eve.
[241:30.16]That's going to be hard not to just crack and laugh my ass off during that.
[241:34.10]Because what a stupid fucking category.
[241:46.87]Best green screen?
[241:47.84]No, no, no.
[241:48.56]Because that wasn't a contest and I don't want to say that it was, you know what I mean?
[241:58.52]Back to work.
[241:59.06]How are you guys doing on food?
[242:02.08]Worst analogy?
[242:04.52]Well, we don't want to get super crazy specific because there's only really... You guys remember like the worst analogy?
[242:11.61]You remember what stream it was?
[242:14.16]Because think about it, this is the archive channel that has every stream of the last year, right?
[242:19.16]But like, you're gonna go back and figure it all out?
[242:24.00]You only got like one day to figure that out.
[242:30.66]Do not underestimate... Best gamer moment?
[242:33.63]Oh, I like it.
[242:35.07]Best gamer... Okay, we're done here.
[242:37.11]Best gamer moment, worst gamer moment.
[242:46.01]And that's good.
[242:48.06]Because I can tell you there's been at least two best gamer moments.
[242:52.30]Oh, wait, there might even be like one or two.
[242:55.20]But that's even funnier to me that there's only one nominee.
[242:58.06]Or two.
[242:58.74]And there's like 20 nominees for worst.
[243:05.53]Yeah, best Jex moment and worst Jerma gaming moment.
[243:08.97]Yeah.
[243:09.57]And that's it.
[243:12.42]I gotta call it there, because this is gonna take a lot of time, so.
[243:15.63]And some of these categories, I might have to just straight up delete, like.
[243:19.95]The ice cream one's fine, I wanna know what you guys think.
[243:21.91]There you go.
[243:31.27]Let me move this.
[243:40.84]Alright, let's go over these one more time.
[243:44.48]So we've got... Oops, wrong thing.
[243:54.25]So here are your categories.
[243:55.15]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 17 categories.
[244:08.19]Worst, so here you go.
[244:09.57]Worst overall stream.
[244:11.39]Remember, what is the worst fucking stream that I've done in the whole year?
[244:20.62]Think about it.
[244:22.44]There's a lot of streams this year.
[244:23.84]What is the worst one I've done?
[244:25.58]That you were just like, that stream was fucking terrible, right?
[244:29.88]What is the worst joke that I've done this year?
[244:31.80]That you were just like, that wasn't funny.
[244:33.06]That was just not funny.
[244:35.16]I didn't think it was funny.
[244:36.26]That was awful.
[244:37.76]There's been a couple of those, probably at least one.
[244:41.48]Worst hair.
[244:44.56]You turned on the stream and you saw the face cam and you were like, whoa, holy fuck.
[244:48.82]That looks really bad.
[244:54.55]Worst joke, taking more than five minutes to set up.
[244:57.35]Sometimes I will pause the stream and I will go do something.
[245:00.77]And in five, ten minutes we'll go by and I'll come back and like press play on it.
[245:04.61]And it's awful.
[245:05.71]This happens sometimes.
[245:08.09]And to even it out, we'll do... Okay, fine.
[245:09.55]We'll do best joke taking more than five minutes to set up as well to, you know, even it out.
[245:27.34]Because that's 18.
[245:27.72]Alright, so you got...
[245:38.36]Worst joke taking more than five minutes.
[245:39.78]Best joke taking more than five minutes to set up.
[245:42.10]Worst new character.
[245:43.10]There's been a handful of characters.
[245:44.35]There's been about five to ten new characters that you've seen on stream.
[245:50.01]Which is the one that is the worst?
[245:57.39]What was your worst chat experience?
[246:03.42]where you were looking at the chat room and you just, holy shit, man, you guys need to chill the fuck out.
[246:08.80]Like, what are you guys doing?
[246:09.74]This chat sucks.
[246:10.80]Like one of those moments.
[246:18.34]So think about that.
[246:22.32]I don't know how I'm going to do that, by the way, because I don't have access.
[246:28.04]It doesn't matter.
[246:29.74]Oh, worst noise that I've made.
[246:33.34]That you hated.
[246:33.88]That you wish I'd never make again.
[246:38.69]Worst new meme that you guys say.
[246:46.37]Worst new meme.
[246:53.13]Something that came from just something on the channel or something that we said, that you say, that I say.
[246:59.50]Not a joke, but like a reference meme thing, you know what I mean?
[247:04.18]The worst category of the year here.
[247:08.40]Why is that up here?
[247:14.44]It's kind of, I'm not even.
[247:25.11]Worst internet issue from last year.
[247:30.01]Where it was unwatchable to a point or you just hated it and it was awful and you left the stream.
[247:38.24]The best noise that I made all year.
[247:40.74]In, you know, contrast to the worst one.
[247:44.32]Best overall use of cardboard.
[247:47.26]There's been a couple, a few times where that's happened, you know.
[247:52.20]What's your best flavor of ice cream?
[247:54.37]No, just delete this one.
[247:55.71]This one sucks.
[247:57.25]That's gonna win worst category.
[248:06.89]Keep it.
[248:07.35]That's the best one.
[248:09.78]No, but, like, that's... Ugh.
[248:14.00]Alright, fine.
[248:14.68]Best flavor of ice cream.
[248:16.10]Nominate your favorite ones.
[248:17.84]We need the worst Peter.
[248:20.06]And we need the best Peter.
[248:28.40]And then we need the worst... Worst... Oh, there's more.
[248:31.56]Fuck.
[248:32.98]Uh, worst sweat moment...
[248:35.51]Where you... I just was disgusting to look at and you couldn't take it.
[248:38.63]And the worst breakdown I had on stream.
[248:41.57]In 2018.
[248:41.90]Remember, these all have to be 2018.
[248:44.40]You can't go back.
[248:45.88]Like... Oh, remember when, like, he told Star to... Remember when he made that video?
[248:50.69]No, no, no, no.
[248:51.13]2018.
[248:51.15]This last year.
[249:04.68]No, we can't.
[249:05.28]It's gonna take so much work for me to put this together already.
[249:09.66]A good 18 categories is gonna be fine.
[249:18.68]I can't even say that out loud because I don't want to give you bias, but somebody just said something really funny.
[249:31.86]Oh, alright.
[249:33.04]No, no, best jebait, worst jebait.
[249:35.46]I can't, this is your categories.
[249:37.76]I can't do much more.
[249:38.66]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.
[249:50.13]No gamer moments?
[249:52.89]Where are they?
[249:55.37]Did they not get in?
[249:58.25]It was best and worst gamer moment.
[249:59.61]Did I type it in?
[250:10.92]Apparently not.
[250:21.25]Alright, now that's 20 categories.
[250:29.43]Let me separate them again so you can get a good look at it.
[250:33.64]Because best needs to be done... I'm actually going to do this.
[250:41.60]Uh, yeah, let's go like this instead.
[250:47.22]We'll start with the best, just because that, you know, obviously.
[250:55.33]Worst internet issue, worst noise, okay.
[251:04.32]Worst hair.
[251:08.58]Okay.
[251:09.76]Because the culmination of this whole thing, guys, is the worst stream of the year is the big award.
[251:15.42]That's the big one.
[251:18.48]So everything's there, right?
[251:19.52]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
[251:20.46]What happened to one?
[251:21.51]Did one get removed?
[251:22.09]Which one got removed?
[251:44.83]Best flavor of ice cream, Peter.
[251:53.82]Alright.
[251:55.88]There you are.
[251:57.34]There are your 20 categories.
[251:59.82]So... In... We're going to have rules here.
[252:08.32]There's a channel on the Discord right now.
[252:14.59]channel is called nominees what you're going to do is you don't just like spam in that channel you have to do just like in previous setups you need to post your nominations in that thread in the format of what the category is category
[252:42.25]and your nominee, right?
[252:44.23]So you have to type it in.
[252:46.19]What's the category?
[252:47.95]Dash.
[252:48.93]Here's the moment I'm talking about.
[252:50.75]Dash.
[252:52.64]Where it is.
[252:54.67]Because you can't just write, oh, go to, remember the stream you did when you, like, fucking bit your finger and you, like, farted?
[253:02.79]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[253:04.11]You're going to have to give me a link to either a clip or to a timestamp to a video.
[253:10.12]And again, there is the VOD channel has a shitload of these.
[253:15.48]Almost all of these streams that I've ever done in 2018 are on that channel.
[253:24.44]So we need to know what stream it was and a timestamp if you have it, or clip.
[253:32.08]Because it's gonna be hard to figure that out if you just write a random sentence.
[253:37.77]So either if it was something that happened in the last 60 days, Twitch is fine.
[253:42.69]You can clip it if you want, if it's happened recently and, you know, put it in there.
[253:47.43]But if it's something that happened a long time ago, back in like January or February or something, then we're gonna need timestamps.
[253:56.19]which is on the, there's a channel that is the archive channel.
[254:01.98]Although it's not an official channel, I've talked to the owner of the channel a few times.
[254:09.68]And that is, it's a huge resource.
[254:14.30]So, again, that channel is not for talking.
[254:20.09]It's currently locked right now, but that channel is only for nominations.
[254:24.67]Remember, you gotta, I'm gonna, let's paste it here.
[254:30.67]Thank you Grump Klump with this great format here.
[254:34.61]Alright, here you go.
[254:36.72]Bingo.
[254:37.74]That's what you need to do.
[254:47.50]And if the hour, minute, seconds,
[254:56.11]I did that.
[255:00.19]Can someone put me back in the Discord?
[255:04.89]What about worst category?
[255:06.23]Is worst category... It's there.
[255:09.21]Worst category, you gotta pick whatever category that you hear that you think sucks.
[255:12.06]I wanna make sure everyone gets it.
[255:21.36]Do we get it?
[255:23.18]Because I'm not gonna be able to talk about this again until New Year's Eve.
[255:27.12]So once me and the mods, whoever wants to help work on it, we're going to pull out nominations.
[255:34.22]There is no, it's just like the Christmas stream.
[255:37.28]We're going to find, you know, ones that maybe, oh, this one, this particular one, like 10 people have nominated this.
[255:43.79]20 people have said this same thing.
[255:45.13]Oh, you know, like this guy said, you know, we're going to pull them out just like the suggestions for Christmas.
[255:49.89]Then tomorrow night, voting is going to be open for about 24 hours, not even, maybe 12 hours.
[255:58.35]Because I got to start working on this.
[256:00.76]So I will not be able to tell you this again.
[256:03.32]Discord.
[256:04.32]Discord, that channel is going to be there.
[256:06.50]There will be another major, there'll be another channel probably put up that is voting.
[256:13.73]And there'll be a link to a voting website.
[256:19.03]It'll be there within the next 24 hours.
[256:30.29]Yeah, and this channel is going to open in about probably like an hour or so.
[256:36.15]Probably like an hour or two.
[256:39.14]Post an example for the channel.
[256:40.44]Okay, here is an example.
[256:42.08]For instance, category.
[256:44.72]Worst stream of the year, right?
[256:49.04]Or worst overall stream.
[256:51.14]Make sure we keep them.
[256:53.12]You got to use the text that you see in the screen here.
[256:56.08]So worst overall stream.
[256:57.47]Make sure the text is correct.
[256:58.51]Take a screenshot right now if you have to.
[257:01.13]Worst overall stream.
[257:03.43]Uh, link to the moment.
[257:04.61]Let's say that's, uh, you know, Hey, I, I'm just, I picked this stream because, and then maybe, maybe like, uh, for instance, like link to moment, I'm going to fake website link, like a hyperlink.
[257:18.07]Right.
[257:19.31]And then if you can do a timestamp in there as well, that's good.
[257:23.40]And maybe you could give like a dash, maybe like a sentence, you know,
[257:27.41]He was shit-faced and couldn't figure out how to open the door.
[257:37.64]You know, you give like a small, maybe like one sentence reason.
[257:42.74]You know what I mean?
[257:46.30]timestamp, hour, let's see, like, for instance, like, 1, 34, here's a perfect example of why I think this.
[257:53.72]You know?
[257:54.56]Like, here, let it go.
[257:56.46]Category, like, worst overall stream, link to moment, fake website link, oh, he was shit-faced and he couldn't figure out whatever, timestamp, if you can do it, hour, 34, right?
[258:05.45]For a reason.
[258:11.29]And that is also the reason why this stream is going to be cut short tonight.
[258:14.21]I'm not stopping now, but
[258:18.10]Please don't post, no, no, no, I mean like I'm, don't post any fake links.
[258:28.14]Thanks for making a coffee pasta.
[258:31.54]Yeah, it'll be, the rules will be there.
[258:36.73]I'm in studio on New Year's Eve, again, 7 p.m.
[258:39.41]Eastern, sorry, 7 p.m.
[258:41.25]Pacific.
[258:43.41]I already have a bunch of the stuff ordered that's ready to go.
[258:45.84]This is the only thing we gotta do.
[258:47.42]And we have about three days to get it ready.
[258:54.76]Somebody just wrote, already got the worst noise, boys.
[259:03.49]Are you allowed to use clips from other streamers' points of view?
[259:07.81]Um...
[259:10.23]As long as it happened in the last year, and it's somebody that I know personally.
[259:15.15]You know what I mean?
[259:19.93]I can't spell cat.
[259:20.71]It doesn't matter.
[259:21.25]I just wrote it.
[259:21.81]I did fast.
[259:22.66]I don't have Grammarly installed.
[259:26.52]So, before the stream is over, I'm going to put this back up.
[259:29.96]But here are your categories.
[259:33.54]That channel will open in an hour or two.
[259:36.56]It's getting set up.
[259:38.97]So think about it now, you know?
[259:40.53]Think about it while you're here.
[259:41.38]You know, while you have a moment.
[259:48.88]You know like one person.
[259:51.08]What?
[259:53.12]Kim.
[259:56.49]Etalyx.
[259:57.65]Star.
[259:59.93]I don't really know very many people.
[260:11.58]Vinny.
[260:17.21]Oh, Burger Boy.
[260:22.91]Are we both hitting this?
[260:29.34]Drake.
[260:38.73]But yeah, what we talked about earlier, but cutting the stream short, it is to get that ready.
[260:45.32]Because once I know the timestamps, once I know the clips, once I know I have to put them together, add effects to it, make little presentations for all the categories, and that's going to take me at least a couple of days to do.
[261:11.86]Will Drake be at JermaCon?
[261:13.72]There is no such thing as JermaCon.
[261:22.03]Dabs for dinner, thanks for the $5.
[261:23.23]And we're almost done doing this.
[261:26.97]I'm not going to fill the whole inventory.
[261:30.44]There's only so much hit rock with stick you guys can handle.
[261:39.88]So again, I'm sorry for like, it's going to end up being like a five hour stream tonight.
[261:46.70]But this will be fun.
[261:47.80]It will be a fun night.
[261:55.16]Five community subs, not five dollars.
[261:58.24]Thank you for the five community subs.
[262:01.74]Oh, the sound isn't even on.
[262:14.94]Alright, who has... I can still load this.
[262:17.90]I have a lot of stuff.
[262:18.90]It's time to sell.
[262:21.61]It just is.
[262:27.35]That's it.
[262:28.09]Yeah, let's go, let's go.
[262:28.85]I got plenty of shit.
[262:30.82]People are getting hungry.
[262:31.62]I gotta feed myself.
[262:36.98]This is the store, right?
[262:38.18]Yeah.
[262:46.12]Masamune's still alive, yeah.
[262:48.13]And fairly healthy.

[263:01.85]Human welcome, human!
[263:02.85]Alright, show me what you got.
[263:07.02]You have a lot of odd stuff.
[263:10.66]Alright, sell value, okay.
[263:15.64]That's not bad.
[263:17.34]These prices aren't that great, but it's okay.
[263:20.94]$17.51.
[263:20.98]We got a lot of these.
[263:27.03]All the money I spent is back.
[263:28.33]That's good.
[263:29.77]Feels pretty good.
[263:35.79]Almost at $10,000 again.
[263:38.87]Now, what do you have?
[263:41.74]Building material, spring steel, steel bars.
[263:44.46]Don't I need some of this stuff?
[263:48.38]Leather Hive vest.
[263:57.29]Nobody has anything else, no?
[264:00.53]Svaluate.
[264:03.69]Just sell it, who cares?
[264:06.25]Building materials.
[264:09.32]Price markup, 77%.
[264:09.92]I need iron plates.
[264:18.12]How many do I need?
[264:19.74]I know I need at least probably five to ten of these.
[264:30.58]It's four for the dummies and then... I should just buy the whole store.
[264:38.18]Because these are... No, okay.
[264:40.60]Whatever.
[264:40.90]There's a lot of other weird oddities in here.
[264:44.91]Look at all this fish.
[264:48.63]books.
[264:49.07]Do you have any just regular food?
[264:50.81]Whoa, that's a lot of food.

[265:05.70]Let's trade.
[265:11.36]Hello?
[265:17.20]Jesus.
[265:21.35]I don't even know where they came from.
[265:22.43]Okay.
[265:24.75]Well, I sold everything.
[265:27.67]I got the plates I need.
[265:28.69]I can go back home with $8,900.

[266:38.12]It's hard to see through this rain.
[266:52.90]Show me what you got.
[266:54.92]Where's this lantern?
[266:57.79]Lantern of Radiance.
[267:01.13]An old lantern.
[267:01.71]It looks pretty beaten up and barely functions.
[267:03.41]There are some worn out scratchings on it which look like the crude drawings of a child.
[267:12.44]Um... It's 40... It's only 45 cents.
[267:16.96]Should I get them both?
[267:28.50]Okay.
[267:31.26]Well.
[267:32.74]This is a standard first aid kit.
[267:34.38]Yeah, I'll get this.
[267:41.93]I don't really need any of the other things.
[267:47.09]Alright.
[267:48.13]Back to town with plates to make the training dummies and then bank the money.
[267:57.52]I need the lantern for the lore.
[267:58.88]That's the most important part.
[268:02.47]Save it.
[268:05.83]Not again.
[268:06.21]What?
[268:08.03]What do you mean not again?
[268:12.77]What did I do?
[268:20.48]Is this porn and chat again?
[268:29.59]Am I gonna have to, like, revoke links in chat?
[268:33.43]Am I gonna have to stop that?
[268:44.14]Have we gone over the edge here?
[269:01.04]Alright, uh, I... I really don't know what to say about that, but... Do I have to do, like, whitelisted links now?
[269:13.08]I might have to.
[269:28.15]Alright, it's saved.
[269:29.91]Let's go.
[269:30.57]Don't click on any links.
[269:31.71]Never click a link.
[269:34.15]Unless I explicitly tell you to in chat.
[269:36.55]Don't you understand?
[269:40.31]If you don't... If you don't hear from a mod or from me to click on this link, don't do it.
[269:50.20]And I might have to edit permissions for links.
[270:03.60]Oh, that's just Frog Musk is down there.
[270:05.58]Okay.
[270:06.64]Let's build the training dummies.
[270:14.07]Don't ever click on anything.
[270:16.89]Just for no reason.
[270:17.75]Don't ever.
[270:18.13]Alright, we've made it.
[270:22.43]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[270:23.43]Why are you stopping?
[270:27.79]That's weird.
[270:30.03]All the research should be done.
[270:35.34]I would assume.
[270:38.51]Too many links.
[270:39.15]Oh my god.
[270:43.21]Well.
[270:45.09]Links are probably going to go bye-bye forever.
[270:51.06]Hey, can I nominate something?
[270:52.24]What do we got?
[271:01.75]Show research.
[271:06.53]okay so training the training dummies are here I need iron plates I got them let's make them I don't have the building materials uh yes you do oh you do okay best porn link in chat no you're not we're not doing that everybody work on it how long is it gonna take

[271:49.94]You can forget it.
[271:50.70]This stream is going off the rails.
[272:00.17]Ugh.
[272:06.92]Ugh.
[272:13.51]Throw it on, yeah, throw it on emote only, it's gotta be done.
[272:16.13]It's gotta be done, temporarily, for a few minutes.
[272:34.62]Best porn link, 2018.
[272:43.66]No, you already got your categories.
[272:45.02]You already know what they are.
[272:45.84]Alright, training dummies are done.
[273:03.47]We can actually... actually fight enemies now, probably.
[273:08.29]So who wants to use it?

[274:10.04]Hold on, somebody got- people are getting timed out by putting too many emotes in emote only mode.
[274:17.43]How do you get timed out in emote only mode?
[274:20.09]That's like impossible!
[274:24.06]How?

[275:54.64]I'm not gonna pick your favorite one, but you're gonna... We already talked about it, you get it.
[275:57.70]It's actually kind of hard to talk when I hear this noise.
[276:05.03]Alright, can... These guys have to be... Alright, alright, so here's what's gonna happen.
[276:12.83]E-mode only mode can now be taken off.
[276:16.49]I think... I think they've calmed down a little bit.
[276:20.49]Figured out that they can't just spam...
[276:24.06]They're gonna be fun.
[276:28.76]Ya boi just gave out 10 community subs.
[276:36.44]Thank you so much.
[276:37.36]Okay, there was seriously like... There were like 200 or 300... Is it 200 community subs today?
[276:58.63]Alright, while you train, somebody has to go buy food.
[277:02.01]You can do it.
[277:08.40]Did anybody see my spam of smiles?
[277:11.38]I... I don't... Maybe.
[277:21.43]I don't know.
[277:27.43]Food.
[277:27.83]I got some food.
[277:28.43]I want some more food.
[277:29.43]Then we're going to go from here.
[277:31.77]I need some more supplies.
[277:33.43]You guys got me all twisted up.
[277:49.76]I can't afford that.
[277:50.52]We might be able to afford another person.
[277:54.16]That's very possible.
[277:58.27]Get down to business.
[277:59.30]I will buy both of these.
[278:04.02]And... No... I really should just steal the fish.
[278:09.49]Steal the fish, steal the bread.

[278:17.03]10 community subs from Chunky Baloney.
[278:20.64]Thank you.
[278:24.88]Even more subs.
[278:27.66]Even more community subs.
[278:36.74]You guys are awesome.
[278:39.63]Except for when you put pornography links in the chatroom.
[278:44.99]And I know that only one guy did it.
[278:48.45]And one guy apparently has done it twice.
[278:51.89]So I don't... I mean, it is one guy, but...
[278:55.51]Double D, thanks for the five community subs.
[279:04.23]Thank you so much, Double D. I kind of want to get a right click.
[279:23.61]Click, click, click, click, click, click, click.

[279:26.53]No, no, no, no.
[279:36.48]Wait, can I... This is a well.
[279:39.02]No, no, I don't want that.
[279:40.92]I feel like I want some more... How are you doing on training?
[279:43.44]You want to sit level five?
[279:48.02]Give Frog Musk a shirt.
[279:49.26]He'll be alright.
[279:50.88]He'll be alright until next time.
[279:55.62]We got three, almost at four.
[280:04.86]Two people can use the dummy?
[280:06.00]Uh, it says one out of one.
[280:09.10]This machine is fully staffed.
[280:17.96]Yeah, I can't, right?
[280:18.80]I don't think so, no.
[280:22.20]Buy a new house?
[280:22.84]Can I buy this one?
[280:26.81]No, I gotta make sure that... I gotta get all the essentials.
[280:29.41]Because now I have a lockpicking kit, right?
[280:33.09]So, let me see.
[280:35.67]Training.
[280:36.63]Locksmith training box.
[280:37.99]I need two iron plates.
[280:38.97]Let's stick this in the corner here.
[280:48.06]Where can I put this?
[280:50.00]Is that gonna be a problem?
[280:54.25]Do I have the materials for that?
[280:55.65]I don't have the building materials.
[280:56.77]Who does?
[280:57.27]I think she does.
[281:03.74]Come on, hurry up!
[281:06.64]Come on, you have the materials in your back pocket!
[281:10.88]Good.
[281:12.40]You don't have them either.
[281:13.85]Didn't I buy?
[281:14.35]Maybe I didn't.
[281:24.90]Looks like we're going over here.
[281:25.78]I need... How many do I need?
[281:28.38]I need two iron plates.
[281:32.36]I wonder, can I buy them in here?
[281:38.59]Well, can I steal them in here?
[281:44.93]No.
[281:45.21]Alright.
[281:45.67]Show me.
[281:46.01]Where is iron plates?
[281:48.83]One, two.
[281:49.46]I don't need two, right?
[281:50.36]Thank you.
[281:52.42]Yep.
[282:02.92]Alright, why do I feel like it?
[282:04.18]Let me just say, okay, wait, wait, wait.
[282:05.68]We brought up a category of worst chat experience, right?
[282:12.55]I feel like subconsciously, a lot of you guys are trying to make it this one.
[282:19.87]It's subconsciously up here.
[282:21.41]It's not even intentional.
[282:33.50]Alright.
[282:33.74]Two people are working.
[282:34.94]What are you doing?
[282:42.02]I need way more than that.
[282:46.76]I guess I could do storage or... let's see.
[282:49.10]Storage.
[282:50.24]Animal feeder?
[282:53.10]Wait.
[282:55.46]Does this mean I can feed... the dog will feed itself?
[283:00.32]Bolt box armor storage, there's so much.
[283:02.34]General storage, oh there's so many things!
[283:12.50]Well it's alright, don't worry.
[283:13.57]The stream is turning off in like 20 minutes anyways.
[283:16.51]Because I have to get started.
[283:23.07]No, no!
[283:24.61]What the fuck!
[283:26.13]What the fuck!
[283:29.02]I told you guys earlier, I have to- I need to get working on the New Year's Eve thing.
[283:41.49]At the beginning of the stream, I said, this is only gonna be like a few hours, because I really need to get working on- we need to get started on this shit, I gotta start buying things, making presentations, I gotta get a suit, like, I gotta get the podium, and it's still early enough where I can get some of the stuff done now.
[283:58.61]It's going to be worth it.
[283:59.39]Trust me.
[283:59.69]Alright.
[284:04.10]You.
[284:05.22]Train on that lockbox.
[284:06.66]You.
[284:08.68]What are you going?
[284:09.06]Mustard 5?
[284:13.67]Am I going to stream on the 30th?
[284:14.85]I'm not.
[284:15.29]You will not see me again until the stream turns on on New Year's Eve.
[284:28.28]after New Year's Eve because there's been a couple of these streams that have been that took more time to do at the end of the year kind of holiday stuff we're gonna who the hell is this there's a okay a hungry bandits are just here what are they doing in here
[284:58.47]Is the guy just leaving?
[285:04.40]He's gonna get shot with a crossbow.
[285:11.30]I don't understand.
[285:16.48]Why did they take so long to attack him?
[285:21.85]I love when they do this shit.
[285:23.57]They all freak out when somebody dies.
[285:35.10]Work on your training.
[285:36.08]God damn it.
[285:36.60]Can more than one person use this?
[285:37.76]No.
[285:45.63]But, yes.
[285:48.25]What were we just saying?
[285:49.09]The game looks awesome.
[285:49.79]The game is very fun.
[285:50.67]Okay, here's what I was going to say.
[285:52.75]Hold up your calendar.
[285:54.51]You guys have a calendar handy right now?
[286:02.56]So, again, New Year's Eve is the next time you're going to see me.
[286:07.30]After New Year's Eve, there's not going to be a stream on New Year's Day.
[286:16.46]But there will be a fuck.
[286:19.22]Hold on.
[286:19.88]I got, like, other shit to do.
[286:20.92]Uh-oh.
[286:33.69]Uh, what am I gonna- hold on, I gotta think about this.
[286:37.09]I actually have to think about what I'm gonna do about this.
[286:39.79]Cause I have to- I got something I have to do on the 3rd of January.
[286:46.76]I was planning on, so, 31st, 1, 2... Shit.
[286:53.06]Ah!
[286:55.62]So New Year's Eve is gonna be a stream.
[286:58.83]New Year's Day, there's not going to be a stream.
[287:02.03]Oh, fuck.
[287:03.92]January 2nd, there's going to be a stream.
[287:07.00]January 3rd, there is not going to be a stream, because I have something I have to do on the 3rd.
[287:11.18]4... Alright, listen to me.
[287:15.04]This is important.
[287:18.91]December 31st, stream.
[287:20.75]January 2nd, stream.
[287:23.93]January 4th.
[287:26.65]5th, 6th, 7th.
[287:31.37]And you know what?
[287:32.47]And the 8th in a row.
[287:40.63]Right?
[287:40.83]Because this is going to be really erratic over the next week.
[287:46.22]We'll do four days in a row.
[287:47.32]Because it's been really all over the place with these other streams that have been worked on, right?
[287:53.84]We'll do four in a row.
[287:55.58]There's a lot of shit that I want to do.
[287:56.80]There's Vesper cleanup detail.
[287:58.12]There's the frog crew.
[288:01.44]There's... I'm trying to think of the other things that I want to do.
[288:08.48]There's Metal Gear Rising.
[288:10.38]There's... I don't know.
[288:15.14]There's a lot of things to do.
[288:16.84]I need to look at like a list.
[288:21.21]On the 23rd, I'm going to be in a full goalie outfit.
[288:24.70]So that's obviously happening.
[288:27.42]It's going to be an IRL stream where I sit there and just... In a full goalie costume.
[288:31.80]Just scared.
[288:33.14]For like four hours.
[288:42.97]This... I haven't played Metal Gear Riot.
[288:45.27]No, I haven't.
[288:45.93]That's why it's going to be fun to do.
[288:49.49]I feel like Roth is being really, really useless right now.
[288:51.91]And you know who else is being useless?
[288:53.17]This dog.
[288:57.11]The dog has not done anything.
[288:59.66]The whole time.
[289:00.18]Just exists.
[289:02.72]But that's okay.
[289:03.64]It's a companion.
[289:04.30]Alright, what's your, uh... You are... Okay.
[289:10.72]You need to go do something while everybody trains.
[289:17.00]What can I do with you?
[289:22.15]I have some money.
[289:22.85]I'm going to look for another companion.
[289:28.03]I could go on a stealing shopping spree.
[289:30.55]Get another companion somewhere.
[289:32.47]Lock myself in a cage and see if I can get out.
[289:34.61]I could go treasure hunting.
[289:46.02]Nobody in here.
[289:49.24]No, it's a plastic surgeon.
[290:00.20]Let's head this way.
[290:03.18]Check this one.
[290:06.52]You'd better play Metal Gear Rising with the controller on easy.
[290:09.44]The parry system will be too jarring for PC.
[290:11.86]Only... Oh.
[290:16.22]Play it on easy?
[290:16.96]Play it on easy?
[290:19.52]Why play it on easy?
[290:27.30]Is that a true statement?
[290:28.34]Should I be careful with that?
[290:31.20]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[290:34.48]Because I'm bad.
[290:36.12]We'll just wait to the best gaming moment.
[290:38.62]Shit.
[290:39.22]I can't wait to see that collage of moments.
[290:48.60]Anybody around for me to... I'm going to have to go to another town, I think.
[290:52.32]Although this is public, right?
[290:53.42]Yeah.
[290:53.76]Let me check in here.
[291:01.82]I'm not gonna play it on easy.
[291:02.84]Why would I play it on easy?
[291:03.78]Any recruits?
[291:10.47]That would want to join me?
[291:14.13]High Inquisitor, let's see.
[291:19.63]Olkern's light shines brightly today, a good omen.
[291:21.44]Do you have any work?
[291:23.90]I'm here to bail out a friend.
[291:27.30]Ah, to pay for your friend's heathen sins in the eyes of Ocrin, their time in incarceration has redeemed them of their evil ways, but to shorten their penance, the price will be steep.
[291:37.15]Pay bounty for... Oh, no one.
[291:42.20]This guy got work?
[291:51.88]Do you have any confiscated goods to sell?
[291:55.78]the holy lord phoenix himself blessed be his name has marked us for the heretics has marked for us the heretics of okran look up for them and bring them to me for holy judgment has marked for us the heretics of okran thanks for the info what no do you have any goods to sell
[292:26.20]Oh, damn, you do.
[292:31.37]But I don't think any of this stuff is worth taking.
[292:36.01]Bring him bounties.
[292:36.97]Okay.
[292:40.25]Heart protector.
[292:47.72]Can't wait for Jerma dying to Pinwheel in Worst Gamer Moment.
[292:50.46]Well, here's the thing about that, guys.
[292:53.17]Uh, you can't just write that.
[292:55.85]You need to have a document that needs to be proof.
[292:59.34]You need to have a timestamp or a clip.
[293:03.48]How's that gonna happen?
[293:06.98]Worst gamer moment when he died to Pinwheel.
[293:09.03]Okay, you just said that.
[293:10.63]I have to show it on screen.
[293:16.67]It's not as simple as just, that's what I'm saying.
[293:18.43]You can't just be like, remember that time when he shit his pants?
[293:21.64]That, that, where, when?
[293:25.06]To be nominated.
[293:29.78]All this stuff is way too expensive.
[293:31.18]Although, not, this is not that bad.
[293:34.30]Yes, it is.
[293:34.68]It's too much.
[293:36.09]No.
[293:37.23]I don't want to spend that kind of money here.
[293:39.17]I'm just looking for a new companion.
[293:49.45]Somebody in here?
[294:06.51]You have shit your pants.
[294:07.53]It was right after you lost to Pinwheel.
[294:09.09]For a second I thought you were going to say, just shit your pants right now and then load up Dark Souls and lose to Pinwheel right now.
[294:15.75]So it's on video.
[294:18.66]That's right, I thought you were going with that.
[294:19.86]Let's see if I can open this.
[294:21.02]Let's do all these things now.
[294:35.80]Alright, it's open.
[294:37.52]Success, we're gonna save it.
[294:43.18]Oh, and that's a 55% chance to steal.
[294:44.86]That's it?! !
[294:47.49]Really?
[294:47.99]On this character?
[294:48.75]There's another one right here, isn't there?
[294:51.61]This is Weapon Cabinet.
[294:57.93]Those cubes are so good, but only 55%.
[294:59.29]That's bad.
[294:59.71]Moon Jupiter.
[295:15.26]Moon Jupiter.
[295:21.02]Just unlock everything?
[295:23.46]Yeah, that's kind of what I'm trying to do.
[295:25.40]I would have figured it would happen with a 33% chance to open, but apparently... There we are.
[295:41.01]Okay, save it.
[295:42.12]55%.
[295:42.14]These are all so expensive.
[295:43.86]Ugh.
[295:49.86]Damn it.
[295:52.15]I'm gonna be here.
[295:52.79]Look at all these locked- more locked stuff.
[295:55.52]Metal chest.
[295:57.18]This is a safe.
[296:01.06]Got a first try, alright.
[296:02.36]What should I- I gotta find the important things first.
[296:11.19]That's pretty important.
[296:15.55]Holy chestplate.
[296:26.00]A plastic spork just gave out five community subs.
[296:32.60]Redemption?
[296:34.47]Redemption.
[296:35.37]Making amends.
[296:38.99]Alright, but once, alright, but twice, two times, how am I supposed to react to this?
[296:49.67]You know what I mean?
[296:50.21]Okay, so if you're in front of the judge right now, you know, you're walking down the street and you like rip a bag of chips out of somebody's hands, okay?
[297:03.32]No, no, no.
[297:03.88]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[297:04.66]Hold on, hold on.
[297:06.94]Somebody, you're walking down the street, somebody drops a bag of chips and then they kind of walk away for a minute.
[297:12.58]You grab the bag of chips as they're continuing to walk and you take them and you eat them.
[297:19.97]Then the lady turns around and says, hey, what the hell are you doing with those chips?
[297:22.11]Those are mine.
[297:22.73]I just dropped them like a minute ago.
[297:24.59]I came back to get them.
[297:25.42]What are you doing?
[297:25.82]You eating them?
[297:26.80]And then you come in front of me.
[297:28.28]I'm the judge.
[297:29.58]You get arrested for that.
[297:31.18]And you say, it was a mistake.
[297:32.34]I'm sorry.
[297:33.42]I didn't mean to do that.
[297:34.66]It was a mistake.
[297:35.34]And I go, alright, you know, it was a mistake.
[297:37.60]That's okay.
[297:38.54]By the way, I have a bag of chips in my hand.
[297:41.95]You can just be more careful while I'm talking.
[297:46.11]You walk up to the podium and you take the chips out of my hands and you eat them in front of me.
[297:53.33]And then you tell me that that was a mistake again.
[297:58.26]How am I supposed to believe you at that point?
[298:01.84]Worst analogy category?
[298:03.32]No, I'm just saying, how do you make the same mistake twice?
[298:08.49]And when they're supposed to be accidents.
[298:19.23]There's no worst analogy nominee.
[298:21.33]It's not up there.
[298:22.63]So, good luck.
[298:29.02]There is no worst analogy.
[298:31.24]And I fucking forgot.
[298:32.22]Did I save it?
[298:39.04]That wasn't a joke.
[298:40.10]How is that a joke?
[298:40.74]That was me explaining how absurd it is.
[298:43.92]for you to get caught doing something and then do it again and say there was a mistake again.
[298:48.57]How am I supposed to judge that?
[298:53.01]Is the judge gonna, you know, let's say there was a judge here.
[298:55.17]He'd be like, I don't know about this one.
[298:56.91]That was kind of fucked up, Jeremy.
[299:16.36]Somebody said, you know Jerma?
[299:17.36]It makes sense.
[299:18.64]Thank you.
[299:31.11]Oh, come on.
[299:32.11]Flip a coin.
[299:32.89]If I had these odds at the fucking blackjack table, I would be a trillionaire.
[299:43.97]No, I would lose all my money.
[299:46.11]Oh, that's the worst analogy in 2018.
[299:59.13]Oh my fucking god, I need this shit.
[300:06.05]I'm gonna crash the game.
[300:09.50]Come up to me with a bag of chips, and I'm sitting there, and the lady drops the chips!
[300:18.38]Somebody got it.
[300:19.68]Whatever.
[300:20.72]There's no worse analogy category.
[300:22.98]Oh my fucking god.
[300:24.40]Go to Vegas.
[300:36.33]He come to me with chips in his hand.
[300:44.68]Yes!
[300:45.88]Finally!
[300:48.08]That only took five, six coin flips.
[300:54.95]You're in Vegas right now.
[300:56.17]What the... What?
[300:59.31]Where the fuck am I?
[301:00.27]Where am I?
[301:00.91]I'm serious.
[301:02.46]Am I alright?
[301:06.48]This is a... I like this heart protector.
[301:09.90]Oops.
[301:10.84]Got it.
[301:18.82]Somebody wrote, haha.
[301:21.64]What is going on?
[301:23.08]Why are you over here?
[301:24.92]Why are you over here?
[301:28.45]Why did you sneak in here?
[301:32.01]I did not tell you to do that.
[301:36.25]Now we both have to hide.
[301:41.99]More room, I guess.
[301:49.20]It's not worth taking.
[301:50.08]I mean, it kind of is.
[301:52.74]This stuff, all effort can have better armor.
[301:55.42]Got caught.
[302:04.97]Can I get a list of the categories again?
[302:06.49]Absolutely, you can.
[302:19.87]Category We're not gonna get caught there were more categories no there weren't
[302:42.09]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
[302:46.99]There's 20 categories.
[302:52.81]Where's worst analogy?
[302:53.87]It was never on the list, is what you're referring to.
[302:58.05]Best shpee moment.
[302:59.29]Oh my god, I would never put that on here.
[303:02.59]I'm not going to put on best shpee moment, okay?
[303:10.67]Best shpee moment.
[303:12.87]Oh my god.
[303:18.77]I'm still hidden.
[303:21.31]This thing is worth so much.
[303:24.27]Why is a rusty chain shirt worth 2,000?
[303:26.17]Save it.
[303:37.77]I said it 30 times this year, I did no such thing.
[303:49.42]You'll put on best and worst Peter, but not best shpee moment.
[303:53.02]You know why?
[303:53.56]Because Peter is a relevant thing from this year.
[303:59.60]Shpee is a video series I made in 2012.
[304:05.16]That has nothing to do with 2018 New Year's Eve for 19.
[304:09.10]Okay, let's try this again.
[304:22.29]This thing's expensive.
[304:23.13]Get it this time.
[304:41.61]Are you blocking me?
[304:42.25]Alright, got it.
[304:45.07]Good.
[304:46.01]Alright, we're almost done.
[304:49.02]Saved it, got all the good stuff.
[304:50.18]I'm just going to put all this equipment on.
[304:53.48]And then take the food.
[304:57.33]Got it.
[304:57.59]Okay, nice.
[304:58.65]This is going to go in here.
[305:10.95]Ooh, two in a row.
[305:16.51]Take the categories off.
[305:20.86]Did somebody see it?
[305:21.98]No.
[305:24.92]Let me get the categories off the screen.
[305:28.02]So again, when the stream is over in just a few minutes here, I'm...
[305:45.07]Best loud shmee moment.
[305:47.09]I can't even, man.
[305:50.63]I need more categories.
[305:51.77]No, this is the categories that I can do in two- I gotta set this whole thing up.
[305:56.70]I got two days to do this.
[306:10.15]Alright, get him off.
[306:11.83]Before the stream turns off, I'll make sure to show him again.
[306:13.55]But first, let me steal one more thing.
[306:17.73]Make sure it's saved.
[306:19.86]Who has a higher chance to do this?
[306:25.10]You do not.
[306:26.66]What about Frogmusk?
[306:27.64]No, he's too far away.
[306:32.28]I got another one.
[306:32.76]Okay, nice.
[306:33.31]I got another one.
[306:40.37]I think Jeremy's addicted.
[306:41.53]I think you're right.
[306:44.15]Did I find some weird work around here or am I getting lucky where if you put it in your backpack it doesn't trigger an event here?
[306:57.46]Well, there's the answer to that question.
[307:03.28]I'm gonna leave.
[307:03.80]This is supposed to be a three hour stream.
[307:05.38]I know.
[307:05.94]I'm out.
[307:06.58]I'm getting out of here really, really soon.
[307:16.16]Okay, got everything I wanted.
[307:17.55]Save it.
[307:17.93]Let's get out of here.
[307:24.23]Best green screen edit.
[307:25.39]This is not going to be a best green screen edit because that was never supposed to be a contest in the first place.
[307:32.06]So I'm not going to do that.
[307:37.84]So I'm good.
[307:38.42]I'm good.
[307:40.64]I do have to stop streaming, though.
[307:42.94]If I have any chance to get most of this done.
[307:45.56]It's only 8.30 here.
[307:46.73]I got some time.
[307:47.41]I got the next couple of days.
[307:51.33]We got some food.
[307:52.13]We're good to go.
[307:55.73]Been live for about just over five hours.
[308:02.52]Yeah, give me some time.
[308:06.96]I'm going to keep the categories on stream.
[308:09.68]Let me just make sure that this is ready to be done.
[308:14.56]Are we good to open the channel?
[308:29.59]Are we good?
[308:30.55]Am I good to have people be able to put down text in here?
[308:39.95]Holy shit, look at all these emotes underneath the one sentence I wrote.
[308:52.90]This is a weird stock market ticker.
[308:55.50]Go look at this.
[308:59.54]Look at these increasing prices on these emotes in the nominees channel.
[309:09.50]Some of them are decreasing somehow.
[309:17.25]So let me get this back on screen.
[309:20.55]And again, we're going to talk about it a couple more times because you're not going to see me again.
[309:26.57]But I do have to turn the stream off to get this ready.
[309:30.55]It'll be a lot of fun.
[309:31.29]I'm going to put a lot of work into it.
[309:34.23]You'll see me in a couple days.
[309:35.15]If you're leaving, I'll see you New Year's Eve, 7 p.m.
[309:38.25]Pacific time.
[309:38.91]We're going to start.
[309:39.95]We'll count down the ball.
[309:40.97]We'll do the awards.
[309:43.34]I'll see you there.
[309:45.28]In studio, by the way.
[309:51.42]Let's get this, like, in a good spot.
[309:53.04]There we go.
[309:58.80]Nah, I'm gonna do the bits.
[310:00.66]Bits and subs, absolutely.
[310:03.30]I'm not gonna skip out on those.
[310:05.52]Only live for just over five hours.
[310:07.36]We should be good to go.
[310:08.52]Shouldn't take too long.
[310:15.98]Why is the mouth breathing?
[310:17.30]Because he's sleeping and he breathes?
[310:21.60]Why is he breathing?
[310:23.64]I'm not sure if that was a comment about why is he breathing or... I don't understand.
[310:30.65]Great Canadian FK Club.
[310:33.87]Thanks for the five community subs.
[310:35.77]Thank you to all the people that gave the nearly, I think, over one to two hundred community subs tonight.
[310:40.79]Holy shit.
[310:41.25]I have to give, uh, rump permissions.
[310:44.11]So let me do that.
[310:47.88]Come on!
[310:49.76]Juggling all kinds of things!
[310:58.34]Let's see...
[311:02.78]Give Grunt permission.
[311:03.62]I'm going, I'm going, I'm doing it!
[311:06.56]Did it work?
[311:07.00]I don't think it worked.
[311:16.38]I think it did it.
[311:18.64]No.
[311:18.88]Okay, um... How do I do that?
[311:24.14]Thank you, uh... Thank you, you boy, again, for five community subs.
[311:43.05]So the cog, yeah, the cog next to nominees, I'm in there.
[311:45.27]Let's see, manage permissions.
[311:54.64]Oh, okay, hold on, here we go, roles.
[311:56.52]Edit channel, let's see here, roles members.
[312:07.37]Twitch moderator, okay, there we go.
[312:14.14]Twitch moderator can do that.
[312:21.35]That should be good.
[312:22.53]Are you good?
[312:25.21]You good?
[312:33.71]We good?
[312:35.05]Oh, I just probably peaked the mic.
[312:36.47]I'm sorry about that.
[312:38.33]Alright, we good.
[312:41.56]So, again...
[312:45.92]Before we go over the bits again, the subs, just be aware.
[312:50.90]Take a look at this.
[312:52.70]There's going to be a good set of rules in that channel.
[312:55.96]That channel's not for discussion.
[312:58.42]That channel's not to talk about what you think.
[313:01.56]If you want to talk about that, what you think nominees should be, then maybe we should... I think I'm going to have... I'll make a new damn channel right now.
[313:13.43]right that channel will be called maybe nominee discussion you know what I'm saying nominees channel is only for your exact what you want to nominate no what do you guys think about this classic spork thank you for five community pornography subs I'm sorry you know that whatever
[313:47.68]Thank you.
[313:49.60]How many submissions per user?
[313:52.78]How many submissions per user?
[313:54.85]I don't know how many submissions per user.
[313:59.83]How many submissions per person?
[314:01.19]I don't know.
[314:03.15]Because there's a lot of categories.
[314:04.49]And what if you had the thing that you want to nominate?
[314:06.92]Oh, man.
[314:07.72]One per category.
[314:08.60]That's a lot.
[314:18.76]Is one per category, can that be handled?
[314:23.96]Do you think that's handleable over the next two days?
[314:42.70]Well, alright, one per category.
[314:47.90]You have to nominate one per category.
[314:53.18]We can do it.
[314:55.38]Well, I'm telling you, I'm putting in like triple time until this stream on New Year's Eve, so... Have fun.
[315:10.59]Good luck.
[315:12.43]And I think I'm gonna make another channel here.
[315:17.85]uh I'm gonna say nye discussion oh like uh nominee discussion I'd spell everything is so wrong how I just felt that nominee discussion you can talk in here about it so let me go into here
[315:50.22]There we go.
[315:53.60]So, can you guys use it?
[315:55.30]Are we good?
[315:59.47]Okay.
[316:07.79]Good.
[316:08.07]If you want to talk about stuff, talk about it there.
[316:09.97]Do not talk about it in the nominees channel.
[316:12.30]Only the nominees discussion channel.
[316:21.01]And is there anything else I need to do for... I think that's good.
[316:33.16]GrumpClump has put rules in that channel.
[316:38.65]Go take a look.
[316:43.81]And make sure whatever you're doing is from 2018, not like 2016.
[316:48.35]It has to have happened this year.
[316:50.77]There's only gonna be one winner per category.
[316:56.55]There's gonna be like six plus nominees per category, but only one of them is going to win.
[317:05.45]What flavors of ice cream were invented this year?
[317:09.74]Oh boy, whatever.
[317:10.98]It don't matter.
[317:17.41]Vote on Discord entries with emotes or repost.
[317:21.33]I would say, if one's already there, like, thumbs it up.
[317:25.17]You know what I mean?
[317:26.65]Because if it's the exact same moment, the exact same thing you're talking about, just make sure that it's seen.
[317:32.11]Make sure that me and the mods know that a bunch of people wanted that one.
[317:34.75]You know what I mean?
[317:37.42]If you have to put it again, then, I mean, we're going to have to deal with that.
[317:40.64]But if you see it already, because there's going to be a lot of submissions.
[317:42.92]So, if you see it already, try it.
[317:47.24]And with that, have a great rest of your night.
[317:48.58]I'll see you on New Year's Eve.
[317:50.60]Let's do the bits.
[317:54.78]Shoo shroom!
[317:55.83]And thanks for watching Kenshi, by the way.
[317:58.21]I'm still into it.
[318:01.51]It's a great, fun game.
[318:03.88]I would give it the stamp of a recommendation at this point.
[318:07.56]I would.
[318:08.24]I think it's fun.
[318:10.36]Maybe we'll come back right to it after New Year's.
[318:12.36]I don't know.
[318:13.51]Maybe we'll take a break from it for a day, come back.
[318:15.75]I want to play it some more, so... I'd like to make my whole community of frogs and dogs.
[318:24.51]But, thank you ShoeShroom for the $3.
[318:25.68]Hey Jerma, remember how I said my bird was dying?
[318:28.80]I went to the vet and his liver is somehow all better!
[318:32.61]The vet said it's nothing short of a miracle.
[318:35.21]Just comes to show that things always get better.
[318:37.33]Thanks for getting me through the bad moments in between.
[318:40.71]Awesome.
[318:42.03]That is fantastic news.
[318:51.22]Really happy to hear that.
[318:58.04]No issues.
[318:59.00]Good.
[319:02.63]Thank you for the $3, and I'm really happy to hear about the bird doing okay.
[319:10.91]Thank you Divis for the $3.
[319:12.39]Again, no message from Divis, just always giving $3 consistently, constantly, almost every, I think every single stream.
[319:19.49]Thank you.
[319:21.37]Timmy Timton, thanks for the $1.
[319:22.69]During the Christmas Eve stream, I saw a guy come in and say, oh, this guy again, and then I assume he left.
[319:34.06]Thank you to Lorag again for $50.
[319:38.78]Hope yourself and everyone in chat enjoyed the holiday season.
[319:42.47]Read the message before, but... Thank you so much, Lorag, if you're still here.
[319:48.65]You are incredibly generous.
[319:49.89]Thank you.
[319:52.07]I really appreciate it.
[319:56.22]Thank you, Jules, for the $5.
[319:58.51]Hey, Jerma, I don't know if you talked about this yet, but have you seen a doctor for your gluten intolerance or digestive issues?
[320:03.85]Did you receive any good advices?
[320:05.55]I have the same issues, so I hope you're doing well.
[320:07.65]Jerma Hart.
[320:08.85]I had a ton of tests done last week, and because of the holidays, I'm waiting back for results on a couple of them, but for the most part, my blood work is very normal.
[320:18.48]I had a food allergy test that's not back yet.
[320:22.10]I have a couple of things.
[320:24.64]There was a breath test that I did to check for bacteria in my stomach or intestines or something that's not back yet.
[320:32.03]But the general blood work was fine.
[320:35.45]And I'm just kind of waiting for a few things, but I'm not going to know until after New Year's.
[320:40.84]Uh, so I don't have very much good advice for gluten intolerance, because I'm not sure if that's what I actually have.
[320:47.51]I mean, it would make sense if it was true, but I just don't know.
[320:52.01]Uh, but digestive issues I've had for a long time.
[320:57.23]I've had IBD for seven years now, eight years.
[321:00.91]Almost a decade.
[321:03.27]And the best advice I could find is because it's so different for everybody.
[321:06.73]Just you gotta find the things that you shouldn't be eating and just try not to eat them.
[321:12.63]There's a lot of foods that just randomly trigger IBD symptoms.
[321:17.53]And they're different for everybody.
[321:20.57]Try to substitute those things.
[321:23.03]I got breathalyzed at the doctor's.
[321:24.75]No, it was a...
[321:27.45]It was a Helobacter pylori test.
[321:29.93]And then I did another one, which was a, like, sucrose breath thing.
[321:35.37]Whatever it was.
[321:36.73]I didn't get breathalyzed at the doctor's!
[321:47.30]Vinny's playing Mother 3.
[321:48.64]See ya.
[321:50.41]Well, thanks for coming.
[321:51.43]I'm sure that'll be a fun time.
[321:55.98]I'm sure that's going to be pretty interesting.
[321:57.10]Does it happen when I drink too much wine?
[322:03.09]No.
[322:04.35]But take care of yourself, Jules.
[322:06.09]Hopefully you can figure it out.
[322:08.97]Trying to figure out medical problems is...
[322:12.11]It's the worst thing ever because it could just be anything.
[322:15.07]I've had this weird back and stomach pain for seven months.
[322:18.27]I have no idea what it is.
[322:20.10]I have absolutely no idea.
[322:21.42]I might just be getting old.
[322:22.70]Is this a symptom?
[322:23.38]Is this something?
[322:23.94]Is it nothing actually wrong with me?
[322:25.56]Am I just fucking old?
[322:26.48]I don't know.
[322:29.54]I don't know.
[322:33.21]We'll find out soon enough, but thank you.
[322:35.55]Thank you the whole keg for the five dollars.
[322:36.87]We're just spreading belated Christmas cheer.
[322:39.79]P.S.
[322:40.05]This game is great for your kind of streams.
[322:45.41]Yeah, I like just kind of hanging out and playing.
[322:47.39]Sometimes it don't have to be crazy, you know what I mean?
[322:50.61]There are some moments in this game that can be, but... It's fun sometimes to sit there for five to eight hours and mind stones and just chat and hang out and... You know what I mean?
[323:02.96]It's a great game for that.
[323:09.43]But thank you, the whole keg, for the $5.
[323:15.07]Another huge thank you to all the gifted community subs.
[323:20.32]Tora T comes to mind here with $50.
[323:26.18]Right here.
[323:27.68]That's so much.
[323:29.32]That's a lot of subs to give in one second.
[323:36.24]And I think there was even more after that, too.
[323:40.12]My god.
[323:43.52]So many community subs.
[323:44.94]And then, 420Squid, thanks for the $1.
[323:46.92]Spyro music is the key to subs.
[323:51.81]I did play the Spyro 2 OST, at least a portion of it.
[323:56.25]But, thank you.
[323:58.19]Thank you, TheYellowist, for the $1.
[323:59.47]Can't stay around, but I'll see you in the VOD, boy.
[324:02.56]Always remember, your time and effort are appreciated here.
[324:08.41]Thank you.
[324:10.21]Hopefully, if you catch this, or if you see the New Year's Eve stream, hopefully we catch you there.
[324:14.52]That should be a really, really fun night.
[324:17.44]That stream is probably only going to be a few hours.
[324:20.40]I'll probably do like a pre-stream thing maybe before.
[324:24.12]But it'll be like a little three-hour event.
[324:27.57]And it should be a lot of fun.
[324:36.41]Thank you to Smellyboy for the $1 save before risky decisions.
[324:39.62]I did.
[324:39.96]I did a... I've saved... quick saved like a thousand times.
[324:44.96]420 Squid, thanks for the $4.
[324:46.48]Call of Duty Round Start Compilation.
[324:50.86]What?
[324:54.88]What is a Call of Duty Round Start Compilation?
[325:01.18]I don't know what that means.
[325:03.72]Is that... am I missing something?
[325:15.15]he doesn't get it Call of Duty round start compilation mission failed I don't know oh thank you uh for the four dollars 420 squid
[325:32.09]E-Dragon, thanks for the two bucks.
[325:33.31]Thanks for the Spyro OST.
[325:34.55]Wish I could give you more, but this is all I have for now.
[325:36.50]Don't worry about giving me money.
[325:37.64]Thank you for even attempting.
[325:38.74]Thanks for even a dollar.
[325:39.86]Thanks for even a cent.
[325:41.34]Thank you for two dollars.
[325:43.56]Thank you.
[325:43.86]Appreciate it.
[325:47.08]It's time for slime.
[325:48.04]Thanks for the one dollar.
[325:48.98]Welcome back.
[325:49.37]Time for slime.
[325:50.03]Spyro OST appreciation bits.
[326:02.81]Maybe he wanted me to look it up.
[326:03.97]Oh.
[326:05.64]Garfield the Monday Killer.
[326:07.06]Thanks for the $1.
[326:08.06]You, right there in the back, come on down.
[326:10.68]What's your name, sir?
[326:11.44]jermaOn 8-5?
[326:12.88]Well, congratulations, Jerma, because you're on America's favorite game show, Spider.
[326:16.20]No, that was a lie.
[326:18.16]Say it with me, folks.
[326:19.19]Garf or no Garf?
[326:22.34]Now the rules of the game are simple.
[326:23.68]Just look at the screen up there and tell me if it's Garfield or not Garfield.
[326:26.56]Are you ready?
[326:27.52]Look closely.
[326:28.20]Is it Garfield or no?
[326:29.72]Focus now.
[326:31.82]There's no Garfield on the screen.
[326:35.74]Did I win?
[326:36.96]Correct.
[326:37.90]Now tell Arlene, tell him what he won.
[326:41.33]That's right.
[326:41.93]One whole Garfbuck.
[326:43.31]I can't believe it, folks.
[326:44.29]See you next stream.
[326:50.63]Thank you, Garfield.
[326:54.24]Magical Rodent, thanks for the $1.
[326:55.68]It's good to see you streaming.
[326:56.56]I've had a really rough day today with my grandfather dying on my birthday.
[327:00.40]As always, these streams get me through the day.
[327:01.92]I'm really, really sorry to hear that.
[327:10.04]Happy birthday.
[327:13.85]I'm sorry for your loss.
[327:14.97]It's terrible.
[327:24.72]Thanks for hanging out.
[327:26.35]Hopefully you feel better.
[327:27.17]It's tough.
[327:29.31]Much love to you.
[327:29.95]Thank you.
[327:34.01]Happy birthday, Magical Road.
[327:39.69]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[327:41.21]Why wasn't the rat song even considered during the music part?
[327:45.74]This is an outrage.
[327:51.88]What do you mean?
[327:59.88]For the OSTs, it's like one song.
[328:03.96]It'd be on repeat.
[328:06.30]Well, that's the point.
[328:14.43]Oh, I see.
[328:16.97]Uh, hey G Floata, thanks for the five dollars.
[328:20.16]Hey, could you put on the Kenshi OST?
[328:21.90]I got a feeling you'd like it.
[328:22.94]The game's ambience is similar to this one's.
[328:25.06]Thanks.
[328:28.94]That would be fun if I did that.
[328:32.40]Uh, thank you Garon Ninja for the one dollar.
[328:34.77]jermaHeart, thank you.
[328:39.91]Thank you Nipple for the one dollar.
[328:41.61]Yo yo, it's my guy.
[328:44.67]Thank you, Nipple.
[328:47.55]You have the second part of your name, but... Thank you for the dollar.
[328:53.29]C4G, thanks for the one dollar.
[328:55.85]Uh, they just say bisexual pride.
[329:00.07]Thanks for the $1.
[329:00.65]Let me see it in the chat right now.
[329:14.96]Thank you so much.
[329:20.90]Captain Worgen, thanks for the $1.
[329:22.46]Follow your dreams, Jerma.
[329:23.56]Don't cave into peer pressure like all the other kids on the playground.
[329:27.88]Well, it's hard when you're one kid on the playground and there are 5,000 other kids on the playground all throwing rocks at you.
[329:39.25]You know what I mean?
[329:46.13]When there are 5,000 kids on the playground all screaming at the same time.
[329:57.67]Comment on the right side of your screen equals rock.
[330:10.98]Yeah, that was way overkill, huh?
[330:13.51]That was way overblown.
[330:14.71]That's not even close.
[330:25.93]That was great.
[330:27.41]What was that person's name?
[330:28.73]Well, that was good.
[330:30.70]Remember that person.
[330:33.86]But, yeah.
[330:35.73]Thank you.
[330:41.88]Thank you, Captain Morgan.
[330:42.74]Thank you, Darkstar.
[330:44.16]700,000 games for the $1.
[330:45.12]Hey, man.
[330:45.46]I want to say sorry about my bits message yesterday.
[330:48.42]At the time, I thought this was... This game was just some poorly made piece of junk that Vinny would play on a Sunday trash stream.
[330:55.41]But I am actually quite enjoying this game now.
[330:59.69]Sometimes you gotta give them a chance.
[331:03.88]You'll know if I think a game is just not worth playing.
[331:06.24]You'll know it.
[331:09.39]We've started and stopped just shit, terrible games in three hours before.
[331:14.99]I think there's something here.
[331:19.07]I think there's something fun here.
[331:24.08]And I think we're close to seeing it.
[331:29.06]It's already been very interesting and very fun so far, just weird and elaborate things happening.
[331:36.91]But you can build whole towns.
[331:39.61]There's whole areas of map that have not been seen.
[331:49.40]It seems really interesting.
[331:50.60]And for the price that it is, I can't really complain, you know?
[331:58.48]This is not a $60 game.
[332:03.70]This is currently, it is, I believe, was it $20, $30?
[332:08.62]It is $29.99 for this game.
[332:15.33]So, it's kind of like, it's a little rough around the edges, right?
[332:22.49]It is.
[332:23.65]But I think that adds something to it.
[332:31.48]Jerma is like 10% of the game at the moment in the newbie town.
[332:35.56]Yeah.
[332:38.18]I'd buy it if it was 30.
[332:39.12]It is 30.
[332:41.06]It's $29.99.
[332:42.14]One cent off.
[332:52.31]It has to be exactly 30 or I don't want it.
[332:58.61]Oh well.
[332:59.43]Sorry.
[333:06.02]But it's like whatever you want to make it.
[333:09.02]If you want it to roleplay as certain characters, if you want it to make... There's a bunch of starting characters you can just pick from and screw around with.
[333:17.11]If you talk like pound for pound, just how much time... Just look at the time I've spent in the game so far.
[333:23.56]I have, what?
[333:25.76]15 hours in the game?
[333:26.42]14 hours in the game?
[333:27.38]Something like that?
[333:30.04]And some games, guys, that are $60, I spend four hours in and I go, this was terrible.
[333:36.43]Or, uh, this was alright.
[333:48.29]So.
[333:50.11]I mean, but games like this are not really for everybody.
[333:54.41]Because they kind of just don't... You don't get to do anything, really, at the start.
[333:58.77]The whole point of this entire game is... You have to start from nothing.
[334:03.05]You're going to lose every fight.
[334:05.59]And it's a little rough.
[334:07.61]Around the edges, it's a little... Wonky, but... You just have to play it and see how far you get.
[334:16.20]Oh, you're very forced into mining.
[334:20.28]Maybe you are, but...
[334:23.85]You know, I'll look into it.
[334:24.68]You're right.
[334:28.34]The Evil Within 2.
[334:29.50]If I could put a worst game of 2018 up there.
[334:33.18]When did Evil Within 2 come out?
[334:37.43]That came out this year, didn't it?
[334:40.53]Damn it.
[334:42.09]I would have just given it to Evil Within 2 if it was 2018.
[334:49.72]I think it was last year.
[334:51.68]I wouldn't even have, like, a category or nomination.
[334:53.40]I would just give Worst Game of the Year to it.
[334:54.80]Are you gonna tell me that you thought that game was worse than The Quiet Man?
[335:01.94]Yes.
[335:03.72]Because The Quiet Man was made on probably, like, a four million dollar budget.
[335:09.73]And even within two, it was probably, like, sixty to a hundred and fifty million dollars.
[335:24.38]That's so much.
[335:28.63]You're making up numbers out of bias.
[335:30.97]I'm just kidding.
[335:34.21]The Evil Within 2 was an awful game.
[335:38.05]It was the worst game to come out in the last 50 years.
[335:40.73]And I'm talking when the Tron video game came out for regular Nintendo.
[335:46.19]That's how far back you have to go.
[335:58.93]I respect- I'm fucking around, guys.
[336:04.03]I'm actually just kidding around.
[336:05.57]Don't worry, nobody go- But wow, I really like D.Va Within 2.
[336:07.99]Why is he doing this?
[336:11.52]I'm just kidding.
[336:12.16]It's a joke.
[336:17.78]He did truly hate the game, though.
[336:19.24]No, it was 2017.
[336:19.54]It wasn't even the same year.
[336:21.36]It doesn't even count anymore.
[336:29.75]Anyways, uh, yes, Kenshi is, I would give it, yes, I don't give, like, letter grades.
[336:34.97]I don't say, well, that's like a, no, just, there's a stamp.
[336:38.25]It's worth playing.
[336:39.27]It is worth purchasing.
[336:42.31]You could probably have some fun in it.
[336:44.66]That's kind of how I judge any game I play.
[336:46.98]Hey, Flimflam, thanks for the $10.
[336:48.74]Worth every cat.
[336:49.82]Thanks for the $10.
[336:58.30]Worth every cat.
[337:01.23]Thank you so much for the $10, Flim Flam.
[337:03.07]Thank you to Neon5812 for the $1.
[337:06.51]Category Worst, Jerma985 Creations.
[337:11.09]I mean, I think that's worst new character, I think.
[337:13.69]If it's in that category.
[337:17.79]You give letter grades all the time.
[337:21.01]Back in, like, 2017 I did that.
[337:21.59]We're talking about 2018.
[337:22.07]Which is a different year.
[337:28.84]Neon, again, thanks to the three dolls have the wasps returned.
[337:32.12]What's that buzzing?
[337:37.71]Is the birdhouse a character?
[337:40.01]No.
[337:41.63]The birdhouse would be... that would be classified as a stream.
[337:45.53]Right?
[337:45.69]That's an overall stream.
[337:52.65]Why are they more worse than bests?
[337:55.53]That's, I guess, kind of the point of the whole stream.
[338:07.23]Thank you, Neon.
[338:08.68]Hey, Darkstar, thanks again for the dollar.
[338:10.30]Amen.
[338:10.58]He's doing the end of P voice, jermaPluto.
[338:14.44]Yeah, he did.
[338:16.64]All Mew, thanks for the one dollar.
[338:18.40]Hey, Jerma, I've been a long time viewer and I love the content you make and will always be here to keep supporting you.
[338:24.34]But the last joke you made was -2.
[338:27.66]This was two hours ago.
[338:28.79]I don't know what I did.
[338:31.38]But even the best baseball players in the world that have ever lived still failed 7 out of 10 times.
[338:40.13]So, I mean, come on.
[338:48.59]Hey, Binaryman011010.
[338:49.55]Hey, thanks, Binaryman, for the $1.
[338:58.52]A category for the New Year's Eve stream should be loudest oh god it's so loud moment of 2018.
[339:03.29]I don't think there are very many of those this year.
[339:20.73]It happens often, but I don't know if that happened if there's any been really crazy ones.
[339:24.27]A couple years ago, back when I didn't understand how to properly configure OBS and stream decks and stuff, maybe.
[339:31.66]Happened a lot more frequently.
[339:32.72]Sometimes I still can't catch it.
[339:35.46]But, no, this is the list.
[339:37.18]That's 20 categories.
[339:39.26]That'll take us a few hours to get through.
[339:40.62]Hey, SuperSeal, thanks for the $1.
[339:45.33]No message, just thank you.
[339:47.73]WalnutCast, thanks for the $10, WalnutCast.
[339:50.79]Best and worst green screen, Jesus.
[339:55.30]Now, thank you so much, Walnut, for the $10, but I'm not going to do a green screen category because that was not supposed to be a contest.
[340:04.10]And making a best and worst green screen makes it a contest.
[340:09.82]There were so many great submissions, I would not want to just be like, yours was the best!
[340:13.13]No.
[340:13.51]That wasn't the intent of that whole entire project.
[340:16.19]And I'm not going to make that the intent.
[340:23.35]Thank you for the $5 here.
[340:24.75]Best green screen, you son of a bitch.
[340:28.19]Again, see my previous comment.
[340:31.88]Thank you for the $15.
[340:45.08]Hey, Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $1.
[340:51.64]Best mental breakdown on stream.
[340:53.14]Best chat in multiplayer game.
[340:58.49]Um, we really haven't done that many of those.
[341:02.01]There was the Holdfast streams.
[341:04.99]There was the MMO stream, where we played like three or four of them.
[341:11.78]There hasn't been very many.
[341:12.60]There would only be about three nominees anyways.
[341:17.35]and Bloons Tower Defense 5 would win.
[341:19.95]They just would.
[341:21.47]So, congratulations to Bloons Tower Defense 5 for winning in that category that's not on the screen.
[341:28.09]It's not there.
[341:29.44]But, congratulations.
[341:33.64]Fentel Breakdown, yes.
[341:35.32]Just those happen quite frequently.
[341:39.18]Pranklin Jr.
[341:39.86]Thanks for the $5.
[341:40.84]Best McDonald's hamburger.
[341:42.78]That would be the Big Mac.
[341:43.68]Don't even need a category for it.
[341:45.11]Thank you for the $5.
[341:45.57]I really appreciate it.
[341:48.80]Five dollars is a lot of money.
[341:50.30]And people give it all the time.
[341:51.74]So, thank you.
[341:53.88]Darkstar, thanks for the one dollar.
[341:55.22]Please don't ban Spork.
[341:56.93]He's just a silly Billy who sometimes misses the C and controls C. Well, I would ask Spork, why are you copying and pasting all these pornographic pieces of material?
[342:14.16]Why do you need to do that?
[342:15.30]It's unnecessary.
[342:26.41]Did he do it again?
[342:27.13]Did it, yeah?
[342:28.00]He did it again?
[342:28.96]This... I might have to just, like, put a cooldown on Lynx for now.
[342:48.15]Maybe that'll be a 2019 improvement.
[342:51.91]Although I'm not sure it's an improvement because I don't want to do that.
[342:54.58]You know what I mean?
[342:55.06]I don't want to have to do that.
[342:57.42]Don't make me have to do that.
[343:10.77]Thank you, Smelly Boy, for the $1.
[343:13.09]Orc no understand why two orcs wrestle no cloth.
[343:19.09]Smork.
[343:21.18]Oh, okay.
[343:22.66]Thank you, Captain Worgen, for the $1.
[343:25.94]Leave corn, not porn.
[343:29.16]This is a picture of corn that Captain Worgen put in.
[343:37.82]Thank you, Honeychain, for the $5.
[343:39.19]I won't be around for the New Year's Eve stream, so I want to wish you a happy New Year's now.
[343:43.91]Hope the new year brings you new joys, and I want to thank you again for all the laughs you've given me, JermaHart.
[343:49.18]Thank you, HoneyChain.
[343:50.60]If you have plans for New Year's, hope you have a lot of fun.
[343:54.60]Be responsible if you do.
[343:56.66]That goes for all of you.
[344:00.77]Thank you for the $5, and we'll see you in the New Year.
[344:04.07]Thank you, HoneyChain.
[344:08.91]Getting close to the end here.
[344:09.67]Well, you as well.
[344:10.21]Hope you have a great 2019.
[344:11.05]All the best to you.
[344:11.51]Thanks for sticking around for 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
[344:13.49]Remember, I can count 19 now soon.
[344:14.29]That's seven years.
[344:40.02]It's a significant portion of somebody's life.
[344:41.48]Thank you so much for sticking around as long as you have.
[344:45.50]And thank you for the $3.

[344:52.38]Thank you, PPVortex, for the $1.
[344:53.98]Hey, Jerma, realistically speaking, how long do you think you would last in a fight with a gorilla?
[344:58.87]The gorilla knows wrestling.
[345:00.81]I would be dead in about one second.
[345:02.89]If the gorilla would just double-hand it, just grab me and smash me into the ground, I would die instantly.
[345:07.35]So not even two seconds, I don't think.
[345:14.36]Thank you, Itris.
[345:15.96]Thank you, Itris Gara, for the one dollar.

[346:02.36]You know.
[346:04.34]I don't want to click it.

[351:17.90]A very large amount of subscriptions.
[351:22.80]Thank you so much, everybody.
[351:24.46]While these go up the screen in a weird fashion... I want to break down one more time.
[351:34.71]It was not a gnome, it was this!
[351:42.17]Let me break down one more time.
[351:44.33]See you on New Year's Eve at around 7 o'clock Pacific.
[351:55.15]I will not be live until then.
[351:58.03]So, take the opportunity to figure out from the categories on here.
[352:02.35]You get to pick one nomination per category per person.
[352:06.41]So that means you can put up to 20, but it has to be on one category.
[352:11.11]You can't just put, you know, 20 different worst gamer moments.
[352:16.49]You can pick one, but you can do it for all of them.
[352:23.68]These nominations will be picked by me and a handful of the mods.
[352:31.49]A day from now, pretty much one day from now, maybe even tomorrow afternoon, there's going to be another link there that will be a poll to vote for the winners of those categories.
[352:48.60]Which will then be put into an envelope and opened on stream.
[352:57.32]The poll is not there yet.
[352:58.56]We need to have the nominations first.
[353:02.94]You'll see it'll be in the Discord.
[353:05.24]Just jump in the Discord over the next 24 hours or so.
[353:08.51]You'll see it.
[353:09.61]You're just going to have to click a link.
[353:11.59]The link will be in the Discord.
[353:15.03]It will take you to a survey, which you will take.
[353:17.43]It'll be every nominee.
[353:19.17]You just got to vote for them.
[353:28.53]Get someone else to make the envelope so you're surprised.
[353:31.93]Um, that's probably what I'll do.
[353:38.08]Look at all these subs.
[353:39.00]Look at all these subs coming in right now.
[353:41.02]It's insane.
[353:46.10]So, I'll see you on New Year's Eve.
[353:48.40]I'm gonna be in the Discord for the next couple of days.
[353:53.64]Lurking checking some stuff out talking to the mods getting stuff prepared because I'm not I'm not going anywhere I'm gonna be sitting here doing working on this so Much love to everybody How many subs were tonight Let me see I think it was like 300 At least two to three hundred
