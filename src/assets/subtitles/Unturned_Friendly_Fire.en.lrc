[00:05.22]Hello Descenters, my name is Etalyx and I am here today with a game called Unturned on the PC on Steam Early Access as of July 7th, 2014.
[00:13.93]I wanted to preface this video, which is myself, Jerma, and MLC_St3alth goofing off, being weirdos, and having some funny moments by telling you that this game is made by a single 16-year-old developer and it's available for free.
[00:25.28]Completely free so I want you to keep that in mind because it makes what you're about to see all the more Impressive and with that said I'm probably also going to make another video or two on the game That's a bit more serious in tone.
[00:35.20]Let's kill some zombies and each other of course Alright, well I'm coming to where I think you guys are if you there's a I'm looking at them I have like a map in game
[00:45.00]Oh, you do?
[00:45.52]How do you get that?
[00:46.26]Oh, you found it.
[00:47.08]Yeah, I found a map.
[00:48.48]I've only got 12% gas in this vehicle, and it depletes extremely quickly.
[00:53.24]So I think I'm heading in the correct direction.
[00:57.37]There's a big area over here.
[00:59.69]Stealth, is this where you were?
[01:01.37]Was there a road?
[01:02.37]I'm coming up, guys.
[01:03.99]I hope that I'm coming the right way.
[01:07.51]I see the bridge.
[01:08.71]There's a car.
[01:10.41]Not your car, I don't think.
[01:11.75]I see a bridge.
[01:13.15]Etalyx is coming to save the day.

[04:17.32]Now it's smoking.
[04:18.48]Put us down.
[04:18.98]Go down.
[04:19.52]Go down there.
[04:21.30]There's some smoking cars down here.
[04:23.08]There's more vehicles down here.
[04:24.30]Oh, they're smoking too?
[04:25.54]What?! !
[04:28.14]Alright, we got some friends.
[04:30.91]Go, Jeremiah, go.
[04:32.03]Oh, there's a beach down here.
[04:34.73]There is a beach.
[04:36.71]What else is down here besides... Maybe there's some... Oh, there's sandcastles.
[04:41.74]Look at the sandcastle.
[04:43.52]Do you guys want to make a sandcastle?
[04:46.70]You better start swinging.
[04:48.62]Do you guys want to make... Wait, zombies can't go in water.
[04:53.17]Those zombies can.
[04:54.67]Yeah, they can.
[04:55.63]Okay, I'm going to move them all over the place.
[04:58.25]Yep.
[04:58.91]You get in that smoking car.
[05:00.93]Okay.
[05:01.59]Just ram them.
[05:03.31]Alright, where are you?
[05:05.43]Alright, see you.
[05:06.65]That's his butt.
[05:08.71]Bro, dodge out of the way, Jerma.
[05:10.15]Dodge out of the way.
[05:10.97]I will.
[05:11.57]Dodge out of the way.
[05:14.49]There goes the car into the water.
[05:16.45]Oh, the car's in the water?
[05:17.91]I barely dodged you.
[05:19.12]Car.
[05:20.38]Look at that, dude.
[05:21.20]You just... That was perfect.
[05:24.08]I barely dodged you.
[05:26.00]Oh, jeez.
[05:26.46]On to pizza.
[05:28.14]Hey, there are your friends.
[05:29.71]Oh, zombie crawler ink in the grass.
[05:32.55]Snake in the grass.
[05:34.95]Get him, Jerma.
[05:36.91]Oh, sledgehammer.
[05:39.56]Alright, guys.
[05:40.70]We finally met up.
[05:42.34]Three friends.
[05:44.06]What do you guys want to do?
[05:45.14]What the hell?
[05:46.78]Is that a door?
[05:47.88]A shield.
[05:50.05]Stay on your side.
[05:51.05]Look at his face.
[05:53.23]Your arms are just coming through.
[05:54.97]Hey!
[05:55.39]Dude, it took us seriously like an hour and 15 minutes to find each other.
[06:00.25]Just check this last house.
[06:01.37]Alright, ready to go.
[06:08.46]Are there no headlights on this car?
[06:11.14]Oh, there we go.
[06:12.54]Got it.
[06:12.96]Alright.
[06:13.70]Let's do it.
[06:14.82]If you turn around, you can see Jarvis sitting in the back.
[06:16.98]That's funny.
[06:17.82]I'm going to sit in the back with him.
[06:19.31]Okay.
[06:19.53]He looks lonely.
[06:20.33]Alright.
[06:21.31]I have no idea where I'm going, by the way.
[06:24.19]Sit back here with me.
[06:25.43]Hey, is there a military base?
[06:27.71]No.
[06:28.37]I did not mean to do that.
[06:29.39]I didn't mean to do that.
[06:30.33]Did you hit him?
[06:30.93]I'm not going to tell you what happened because I don't want this to turn bad.
[06:34.93]I'm trying to do it.
[06:35.95]How do I hit you?
[06:37.61]You can't.
[06:39.02]Only I can, apparently.
[06:39.98]Alright, let's go.
[06:42.04]You can, like, shoot out of the windows.
[06:43.26]How?
[06:43.94]If you have guns.
[06:44.90]I don't know.
[06:46.22]Can I shoot him in the backseat?
[06:48.14]Don't even tell me.
[06:49.28]Seriously, don't.
[06:50.91]Don't even seriously.
[06:52.63]Hey!
[06:55.09]Oh, you killed me!
[06:56.41]What just happened?
[07:15.61]I put that axe in the back of your head.
[07:17.61]Why?
[07:19.91]I didn't mean to.
[07:20.89]But why?
[07:24.01]I seriously didn't mean to.
[07:25.41]And now I'm just looking at stealth going back and forth like hitting our bodies.
[07:29.56]I was so scared that stealth was gonna like attack me.
[07:33.38]That you killed me?
[07:35.84]No, I didn't even mean to right click.
[07:41.08]Yeah, I just saw a gunfight erupted the back of the car.
[07:58.44]That was his fault.
[08:00.16]It's always his fault.
[08:01.78]I had to punish him for his evil acts upon you.
[08:04.46]Don't shoot me.
[08:10.40]And then Daleks just got dragged into it.
[08:13.17]I don't know why.
[08:14.19]That was funny.
[08:18.65]You're just, like, driving the car.
[08:22.45]And I just turned and just, like, took your head off.
[08:26.04]I don't think that was going to instantly kill you.
[08:29.94]I really did.
[08:30.54]I'm crying right now.
[08:32.97]I really didn't think that was going to instantly kill you.
