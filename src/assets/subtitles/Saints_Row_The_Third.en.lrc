[ve:60.16.100]

[00:06.27]What's happening?
[00:07.37]Hey.
[00:11.87]What's up?
[00:15.02]I'm back.
[00:17.92]On my part two of three of times where I'm going to disappear for like two and a half weeks.
[00:23.52]Or one week or whatever.
[00:24.64]Ten days.
[00:25.02]That was the second time in the last two months.
[00:28.28]There's going to be one more.
[00:29.66]Not right now though, don't worry.
[00:33.76]Got a couple weeks here of just chillin'.
[00:43.66]Saints Row, yeah.
[00:44.60]Saints Row.
[00:47.64]You got a pre-stream chat, guys.
[00:54.28]Pre-stream chat.
[00:56.38]I would start participating.
[00:58.56]They hold a lot of power.
[01:05.11]Let me break it down.
[01:06.87]I go... Okay.
[01:08.87]Every time there's a stream... Let's say a stream is scheduled for 2 o'clock.
[01:15.28]Okay.
[01:15.44]Well, 4 o'clock, whatever.
[01:17.20]Somewhere around like 1 to 3 p.m.
[01:19.48]I will come in here.
[01:20.12]And I'll say, hey, what's up, guys?
[01:22.94]How are you?
[01:23.30]What's going on, everybody?
[01:25.69]And people go, Jerma!
[01:27.07]Oh, Jerma, what's up, man?
[01:28.97]Oh my god, he's here!
[01:29.83]Oh my god, I'm such a huge fan.
[01:32.23]Nobody says anything else negative or anything like that.
[01:35.13]They're always very supportive.
[01:37.41]They never tell me to leave every time.
[01:39.09]I don't see, in all capitals, leave anytime I write a message, which I don't get that, by the way.
[01:47.72]Every time I've talked in the pre-stream chat, everybody just says leave at the same time.
[01:52.52]Hey, this is my chat here, okay?
[01:58.40]If I want to poke in, look, this is my house.
[02:07.05]We literally did that today.
[02:08.39]Yeah, you do it every day.
[02:11.58]Regardless of the mean nature of some of the pre-stream chat.
[02:18.48]We talk.
[02:19.86]I kind of chill in the pre-stream for like 10 to 20 minutes, usually.
[02:24.33]Well, I say that I write like three messages, but I'm there watching.
[02:31.78]I put a poll up.
[02:33.04]Here's three or four games that I would, I want to play, which, what do you guys want to see?
[02:37.10]So let me tell you what the non-pre-stream chat viewers have missed out on.
[02:40.32]They, they voted today for Saints Wrath 3.
[02:46.66]There was, Chivalry 2 was on that list.
[02:48.56]It got three votes.
[02:50.92]I'm not making that up.
[02:52.64]Out of, I think, one, maybe I think like two or three hundred people in pre-stream, I think three people clicked Chivalry 2.
[02:58.40]I was very surprised.
[03:05.26]I mean, I'm probably going to play it at some point.
[03:12.30]What's this emote?
[03:13.04]Germacheased.
[03:14.00]I don't know.
[03:14.36]I don't know.
[03:16.55]I don't know what it is.
[03:17.15]I can't even see it.
[03:18.81]What is it?
[03:19.13]I just see the text.
[03:24.97]I don't know why I can't see it.
[03:28.67]What does it look like?
[03:33.22]You uploaded it.
[03:34.22]I did not.
[03:36.53]I have given my mods complete and total creative control for every single emote on BTTV.
[03:45.25]I don't even know what they are.
[03:51.16]You personally uploaded it.
[03:54.88]But no, I've been away for a while, working on stuff, doing some personal life things.
[04:00.57]I'm sure some of you guys have seen the picture.
[04:05.04]of me what it looks like officiating a wedding.
[04:09.10]I don't know where that photo's from.
[04:10.68]I'm going to... I didn't do that.
[04:12.78]Very strange.
[04:14.74]Somebody... I mean, I got photoshopped into that somehow.
[04:21.57]People called me... People calling me Priest Andy.
[04:28.57]No, Community Jake got married, and that's kind of where I was.
[04:32.55]I officiated Community Jake's wedding, which is crazy, right?
[04:36.84]I've never done that before, but it was a beautiful ceremony, two really great people, so I was more than happy to.
[04:43.40]No, I'm not ordained.
[04:56.64]Hey, I just want to ask, dude, what's wrong with you?
[04:58.26]Love the streams, by the way.
[04:59.26]That's a loaded question.
[05:00.70]How do I answer that in five seconds?
[05:04.04]Actually, no, I could answer that.
[05:06.45]What's wrong?
[05:07.05]I ate Captain Crunch every day for like breakfast, lunch, and dinner for about four straight years when I was a kid.
[05:13.85]There you go.
[05:14.17]This is your answer.
[05:22.34]I'm embellishing.
[05:23.46]It did not happen.
[05:24.28]I'm kidding.
[05:27.04]Okay, I would say probably for like a year or two years, I ate Captain Crunch every single day.
[05:33.76]It's got vitamins in it.
[05:34.58]That's not the only thing I ate.
[05:40.05]People take the things I say here when I'm fucking around and they act like, holy shit, of course he's a weird guy.
[05:45.31]He ate Captain Crunch for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[05:47.25]Nobody, who would do that?
[05:48.15]Nobody, I'm kidding.
[05:55.52]Who would do that?
[06:01.16]This dude has a lack of neurons now.
[06:05.14]I do not have a lack of neurons.
[06:06.90]Yeah, okay.
[06:10.26]Okay.
[06:11.24]Lack of... Oh, he's got a lack of neurons.
[06:13.26]He's killing... Oh, he killed all his brain cells, but he didn't kill all the Captain Crunch.
[06:18.09]How many times a week do you smoke weed?
[06:21.93]Yeah.
[06:22.89]Okay.
[06:26.45]Don't come at me on the high road here.
[06:32.85]None.
[06:33.43]I don't do that.
[06:35.45]Some of you do.
[06:37.07]This is PR.
[06:38.14]He's projecting.
[06:39.14]Projecting on Megalo.
[06:45.34]You're a bad influence.
[06:46.74]I really hope not.
[06:48.62]Look, I... What the fuck is this emote?
[06:54.39]I'm looking at the mod chat right now.
[06:55.87]This is what that is?
[06:58.53]Who allowed that?
[07:00.78]Who allowed that?
[07:01.64]That shouldn't be allowed.
[07:02.50]That's horrible looking.
[07:10.39]Eat human food.
[07:11.73]Guys, I eat plenty of greens.
[07:13.63]Plenty of vegetables.
[07:15.19]I have a pretty balanced diet.
[07:20.26]I try to eat not too much meat, but enough meat because I like meat.
[07:24.52]Try to balance it out a little bit.
[07:31.07]But yeah, it's good to see you again.
[07:33.27]I'll be back the next couple of weeks.
[07:34.49]I'll be here pretty normally.
[07:36.15]Two, three times a week.
[07:37.41]Like you're used to.
[07:39.55]Then... Oh.
[07:42.25]We got the Jerma Baseball Association.
[07:46.13]Which is gonna... I'm very excited about that.
[07:48.97]And then we've got... We've got the green screen stream.
[07:51.91]Ladies and gentlemen, the green screen stream.
[07:54.82]Thank you for all of your submissions.
[07:58.13]There were thousands of submissions.
[08:00.85]There's no way I'm going to be able to do them all.
[08:04.33]They've been narrowed down to a doable amount.
[08:10.14]Had to narrow down thousands of these submissions.
[08:14.46]So, on June 30th, mark that on your calendar.
[08:21.14]I will be in front of the green screen doing all of your favorite, all of your favorite actions.
[08:31.15]Also, something else really cool.
[08:34.39]On the 27th, so in two days from now, Mizkif is running a Smite tournament.
[08:40.21]A $100,000 tournament.
[08:41.31]I am a team captain.
[08:51.26]I am a team captain for this tournament.
[09:01.35]Who's on the team?
[09:02.73]The team is... Okay, here we go.
[09:05.67]Me.
[09:07.91]PokeLulz.
[09:09.71]Russell.
[09:12.59]Surefour.
[09:16.01]And then the final contestant.
[09:22.09]is NoCo.
[09:24.65]With our coach being Weaken.
[09:28.89]This is gonna be a good fucking team.
[09:32.65]These are called cringe Andy, I didn't even do anything.
[09:38.43]Just watch us just roll over the competition, okay?
[09:44.58]Have you guys practiced?
[09:45.58]Not once.
[09:46.08]I, as team captain, have called for a practice.
[09:50.68]I wrote a, I literally wrote a paragraph.
[09:55.67]And nobody responded.
[09:56.59]I think we're going to hopefully get together at least.
[10:08.02]Can we type practice, right?
[10:10.28]I wonder if that would work.
[10:18.66]Is typing practice?
[10:20.16]Okay, in a Discord group, right?
[10:25.39]Just kind of be like, alright, so you go down that way, you go down... Do we have to actually do it?
[10:34.79]I think most people in the competition... I don't think... I don't know if there's very many people that are really amazing at the game.
[10:43.31]I don't know.
[10:44.01]I know what some of the teams by now.
[10:46.78]There's a lot of people involved.
[10:47.88]I mean, I think we got a pretty good shot.
[10:50.04]Have you guys seen?
[10:50.80]Have you guys seen my Anubis?
[10:52.96]You guys have watched me not miss a single Mummify.
[10:59.02]I'm telling you right, this picks and bans?
[11:01.78]They let me get Anubis, it's fucking over.
[11:04.42]It's over.
[11:09.52]I don't know what their plan is to broadcast.
[11:11.16]I think... I'm sure there'll be people probably commenting it.
[11:13.32]I don't know.
[11:16.12]Should be really fun.
[11:16.72]Sounds like a fun team.
[11:23.31]Who else was I good at?
[11:24.07]I remember those... You don't know that Anubis got nerfed.
[11:26.65]That doesn't matter.
[11:29.33]That could be the worst god in the game, and I'd still do alright with it.
[11:33.37]You're Anubis?
[11:35.85]Guys, this is all psychological, okay?
[11:38.85]If everybody thinks that I'm really fucking good with this character, then they're gonna freak out.
[11:45.38]Just shut up.
[11:45.82]I have a plan.
[11:47.14]You don't understand the psychology here?
[11:51.02]The more I talk about Anubis, they're gonna fucking ban Anubis.
[11:53.64]And who gives a shit?
[11:54.54]That character sucks.
[11:56.30]Do you get it?
[11:57.02]Are you understanding this now?
[11:58.19]Can you please just relax and let me do what I'm doing as a team captain, for God's sakes?
[12:05.06]Would you let me do what I'm doing as a team captain?
[12:06.74]Quiet.
[12:07.93]Enough.
[12:09.73]I don't want you to screw this up for me.
[12:14.65]And then, look, all you guys are going to go to the other teams and be like, he's actually, the Anubis thing is a joke.
[12:20.31]And then they won't ban Anubis.
[12:22.28]And then I get like 20 kills in one game with Anubis.
[12:24.94]It's all psychology.
[12:28.66]I'm glad you guys get it.
[12:42.10]I just want to play.
[12:42.86]I thought it was a fun idea.
[12:44.31]Alright, you guys ready?
[12:47.97]Let's get going.
[12:48.49]It's good to see everybody.
[12:51.15]Hope you're all doing well.
[12:51.99]Did I tweet?
[12:52.57]I did.
[12:56.45]He wants the money.
[12:59.35]So this is Saints Row 3.
[13:00.45]I have never played Saints Row 3.
[13:02.34]Just like when it was Saints Row 2.
[13:04.46]I think... Maybe I was in the menu.
[13:06.82]Maybe I went to the first area.
[13:08.30]I don't know.
[13:08.72]I don't have any memory of playing it.
[13:12.83]But there's your plan for the week.
[13:15.31]We got, bang, Saints Row 3 tonight.
[13:19.23]27th, SMITE $100,000 tournament, which we are guaranteed to win.
[13:25.00]And then the 30th, green screen.
[13:27.86]Let's go.
[13:28.78]Stacked fucking week.
[13:30.10]Stacked week.
[13:35.35]Okay, let's go.
[13:36.27]Saints Row.
[13:43.10]Can you hear it?
[13:48.15]We can now.
[13:50.51]Can you see me?
[13:52.35]You know, you guys notice I've been doing face cam every single day now.
[13:55.59]That's completely, that's unheard of.
[14:00.66]Can you guys remember a time when I ever did this?
[14:03.34]And I don't even know why I'm doing it.
[14:06.38]You know what I mean?
[14:07.00]I don't even know why I started doing this.
[14:14.63]I just sort of started doing this.
[14:18.71]Right?
[14:22.23]I was a no face cam guy forever.
[14:24.65]For almost 10 straight years.
[14:26.47]And then I played Elden Ring and kept the face cam on and now it's just on permanently.
[14:33.90]I don't know.
[14:34.66]I don't even want this on.
[14:36.14]I don't want this on.
[14:37.22]And I'm going to turn it off immediately if I feel like it.
[14:41.00]The second that I don't care anymore, it's going off.
[14:43.43]Like, I'm a weirdo, whatever.
[14:44.67]Alright, let's go.
[14:45.95]New campaign.
[14:46.49]Normal.
[14:46.79]We're not playing hardcore.
[14:49.71]How is it?
[14:50.01]Is it loud?
[14:50.47]How loud is it?
[14:58.04]That looks fine.
[14:58.60]60.
[14:58.96]Alright, quiet.
[15:01.87]Here comes the opening cutscene.
[15:02.69]Quiet.
[15:08.57]This game has DMCA songs?
[15:09.95]I don't even care.
[15:12.07]I'm sorry, I just don't anymore.
[15:17.57]Conquest.
[15:17.97]That's what we're playing, by the way, in the Smite $100,000 tournament.
[15:21.99]It's Conquest 5v5.
[15:29.41]We're not doing Arena.
[15:30.27]I haven't played Conquest in five years, at least.
[15:33.15]We're gonna lose.
[15:35.91]If I play Mage and I do Mid, I'm gonna miss every rotation.
[15:39.49]I'm probably gonna go 0 and 15 or something.
[15:46.30]No, I don't think so.
[15:47.12]I think I'll be alright.
[15:49.82]Dude, you suck at Smite.
[15:50.96]No, I don't.
[15:55.25]I don't suck at Smite.
[15:57.61]Okay, loading into a game that you haven't loaded for two or three straight years, and you jump into Conquest when the meta has changed completely is... You can't... It's not just like getting back in there and just, oh yeah, I'm gonna go 10-0 no matter what.
[16:14.12]That's not gonna happen.
[16:14.76]You're gonna lose.
[16:15.26]I streamed the game one fucking time and get my ass kicked by a bunch of other people that were playing every day.
[16:26.76]I'll be just fine.
[16:33.18]What about the lore?
[16:34.00]Energy drink.
[16:58.73]Can I do that?
[17:02.05]What?
[17:04.17]Oh, it's an ad.
[17:07.86]Okay.
[17:09.90]Japanese commercials.
[17:11.48]Easiest money you'll ever make.
[17:13.54]Grant Lawson is right up there.
[17:15.34]You ready for this?
[17:16.26]Is this 30 FPS?
[17:18.46]I do my own stunts.
[17:20.78]Hey, you're just a ride along man.
[17:23.14]Hong Kong style in there.
[17:25.32]I am a method actor.
[17:27.73]If I'm gonna play a scene with any degree of emotional truth, I gotta make it real.
[17:36.66]Is this 30 FPS?
[17:38.06]It'll be real.
[17:40.14]You're robbing a bank dressed like yourselves.
[17:42.82]Hell yeah.
[17:43.98]Who doesn't want to be Johnny yet?
[17:46.24]Ultra post-modernism.
[17:52.32]Who cares if it's 30 FPS?
[17:54.48]But do we really gotta drag this asshole actor around?
[17:56.78]Can't jar some slack.
[17:58.34]He's just researching his part.
[17:59.84]Yeah, I hope he signed a waiver.
[18:01.12]Alright, people.
[18:05.30]Nobody moves!
[18:06.68]Nobody dies!
[18:08.66]Sorry, jumped his line.
[18:09.86]Can we, uh, can we go again?
[18:11.58]You all know the drill.
[18:12.84]This game came out in the 60s.
[18:14.24]No, it didn't.
[18:14.94]It came out... What are you talking about?
[18:16.18]Can I get a picture with the boss?
[18:18.00]Say sleaze.
[18:19.66]Get mine, bitch!
[18:22.10]Hey, don't be a dick.
[18:23.96]Do you call yourself gangbangers?
[18:26.36]You're a bunch of pussies.
[18:28.44]We should be all up in their shit like fuck.
[18:36.91]Oh, that's different.
[18:39.63]This game is older than you.
[18:40.71]It is not.
[18:43.47]You got a plan and we just shooting all these motherfuckers.
[18:46.25]That is my plan.
[18:47.59]Works for me.
[18:52.73]Wait, it's time to play?
[18:53.29]Is it time to play?
[18:57.91]Now, okay, now it's 60 FPS.
[18:59.59]What am I going?
[19:00.01]What's happening?
[19:00.87]Where's the ball?
[19:01.81]Go to hell!
[19:02.35]You wanna play, motherfucker?
[19:04.83]I thought that was a fucking person.
[19:11.40]The one thing that I shoot at.
[19:14.22]I have it on ultra graphics, by the way.
[19:16.10]Alright, people.
[19:17.78]Let's find that ball.
[19:21.06]Wait, can I switch between people?
[19:26.06]Alright, where do I go?
[19:31.88]Is there a melee?
[19:32.50]What's melee?
[19:33.56]We can't go in?
[19:34.87]Alright, let's go.
[19:35.81]What's melee?
[19:37.77]Okay!
[19:52.56]Is there screen shake?
[19:54.40]It's not really... It's barely screen shake.
[20:05.67]What?
[20:05.85]The audio sounds weird to me.
[20:07.09]I gotta change the audio.
[20:13.26]Wait.
[20:15.14]The audio sounds weird, right?
[20:29.74]Oh, come on.
[20:31.96]You know what I was trying to do.
[20:34.83]Audio shake.
[20:37.17]How do you sprint?
[20:39.87]What sprint?
[20:40.41]How do I sprint?
[20:40.85]Alright, go upstairs.
[20:48.76]Shift?
[20:49.10]No, I got a controller.
[20:49.84]How do I do it?
[20:50.14]Left bumper?
[20:51.48]Left bumper?
[20:57.46]Make your facecam bigger.
[20:58.56]No.
[20:59.44]It's already way too big.
[21:00.22]I can't breathe.
[21:02.59]Why are you not playing the remaster?
[21:04.55]I didn't even know the remaster existed.
[21:06.19]No way we're cracking this thing.
[21:07.41]There's a remaster for Saints Row 3?
[21:10.03]Josh, get over here.
[21:11.49]Got the tools right here, Holmes.
[21:15.21]Is there really?
[21:16.07]So, uh, what's plan B?
[21:18.02]Drilling?
[21:18.92]I didn't know.
[21:19.54]Why the fuck would I know this?
[21:21.46]What?
[21:23.62]Not cool, man.
[21:26.95]Time to get to work.
[21:31.54]We'll need to set those above the vault.
[21:34.52]Alright, let's go.
[21:35.90]Hey, I think we've got company.
[21:38.16]Looks like they're coming in from the lobby.
[21:39.92]What the fuck just happened?
[21:43.38]I was my weapon wheel.
[21:44.49]Give me the weapon wheel.
[21:45.59]It's just, if I die here, I don't want things to go unsaid.
[21:50.99]I should be solo.
[21:51.77]Let's get him!
[21:56.87]Alright, let's go.
[21:58.38]Let's move, move, move.
[22:04.36]What?
[22:07.08]Am I sending an autograph?
[22:09.02]Why the hell am I sending an autograph?
[22:18.21]Make the head part of your face cam bigger.
[22:19.95]No.
[22:20.27]We're going to take these masks off in like 10 seconds.
[22:38.24]Zoom your face in.
[22:39.22]Alright, chopper.
[22:40.02]Now what an idiot.
[22:40.75]He pressed the alarm button.
[22:41.99]Now what?
[22:42.55]Alright, BLS.
[23:07.19]Oh, okay, yeah.
[23:08.73]We'll do this.
[23:09.31]Alright, let's defend.
[23:10.81]How do I crouch?
[23:11.95]Left stick, I think, right?
[23:16.69]Why would you do that?
[23:18.91]Why would you do that?
[23:20.04]This is a huge open area.
[23:21.14]Why would you do that?
[23:21.72]That was completely and absolutely unnecessary.
[23:26.36]No reason to do that.
[23:27.02]But wait, come here.
[23:33.89]Come on.
[23:39.25]I forgot how ugly this game is.
[23:41.01]Does this game really actually have a remake?
[23:46.41]What was it called?
[23:53.34]Yes, it does.
[23:54.28]What was it called?
[24:00.44]Saints Row the Third Remaster.
[24:04.25]What's going...
[24:09.26]It's trash.
[24:17.28]Oh my god.
[24:17.96]Do I even fit in health?
[24:32.82]The remaster is actually bad.
[24:34.34]Is it really?
[24:49.41]I'm out.
[24:50.35]I'm out of bullets.
[24:53.55]I don't think I can die in this.
[24:55.12]Yeah, I literally can't die.
[24:56.00]I'm being lit up by a Gatling gun on a helicopter.
[24:58.86]I can't.
[24:59.68]-2 what?
[25:07.60]I can't die.
[25:08.42]I can't die.
[25:09.92]It's just minor graphic improvements.
[25:15.48]Oh, okay.
[25:21.08]Jermania?
[25:21.47]What are you talking about?
[25:22.79]I haven't announced any wrestling stuff.
[25:27.59]What the fuck are you talking about?
[25:33.81]Is the game volume too high or too low?
[25:41.71]Too low.
[25:42.67]Okay.
[25:47.29]How's that?
[25:48.35]Crank it.
[25:50.65]Crank it.
[25:58.02]You would not want to be firing.
[26:01.28]What's happening?
[26:09.91]Better?
[26:10.35]Alright.
[26:17.68]Fucking crank it.
[26:33.37]What?
[26:33.73]What the fuck is happening?
[26:46.70]This feels like a mobile game ad.
[26:47.60]I've... Crank it.
[26:48.04]How much armor's on that damn thing?
[27:08.34]Not bad.
[27:08.88]Jesus!
[27:14.10]I can't afford for your pie!
[27:19.37]Which, by the way, I gotta do the mobile game stream.
[27:22.80]I was talking about that for a long time and I never did it.
[27:27.26]We gotta do it.
[27:27.76]We have to do it.
[27:30.74]Is it weird that I want to buy a completely new iPad?
[27:34.81]Because I feel like it's not going to ever work ever again.
[27:40.11]Where we just play all the games that you get ads for.
[27:42.87]All the mobile games you get ads for.
[27:47.04]Play them all.
[27:47.66]And spend at least an hour in each one.
[27:49.34]Or at least 20 minutes at least in each one.
[27:50.84]I need to get a burner iPad for that.
[28:00.85]Get a burner iPad.
[28:07.65]Just emulate it?
[28:11.76]What?
[28:13.58]You can actually emulate it?
[28:15.20]Well, shit.
[28:19.51]Alright, there we go.
[28:25.67]You can get an Android OS emulator.
[28:28.91]Really?
[28:29.21]Oh, shit.
[28:33.21]Okay.
[28:33.75]I didn't know that.
[28:34.29]That's cool.
[28:38.49]Alright, yeah.
[28:39.00]Let's customize the character now.
[28:42.66]Here we go.
[28:43.08]Let's make the... We're making the McRiddler.
[28:48.32]If I can.
[28:53.22]That doesn't look old.
[28:54.13]That just looks kind of dehydrated.
[28:59.01]This is before the glass of water, and this is after the glass of water.
[29:05.51]Sex appeal?
[29:07.75]Okay, that's a dick.
[29:08.69]That's a huge dick.
[29:13.58]I thought it was going to make me handsome.
[29:15.92]I didn't know that's what that was.
[29:19.84]Okay.
[29:20.70]That's fine.
[29:21.92]Okay.
[29:23.54]Okay.
[29:25.10]Build.
[29:28.80]Is there a, uh... I'm gonna try to make the McGriddler if I can.
[29:34.97]Is it, can I not?
[29:36.57]Is there an advanced mode?
[29:48.90]No?
[29:53.69]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[29:54.33]I used hacks last time.
[29:55.47]Shit.
[29:56.35]Oh, no, I actually used hacks.
[29:59.67]Fuck.
[30:00.25]I did use hacks last time.
[30:02.38]Damn it.
[30:02.90]Okay.
[30:04.34]Oh, no.
[30:05.46]I can't do it.
[30:06.10]I don't have the hacks.
[30:09.24]It's alright.
[30:16.83]How hard is it to get the hacks?
[30:26.75]Do they exist?
[30:29.11]Scroll down on the skins.
[30:37.42]Why did you make a guy made out of emerald?
[30:39.20]I kind of want to do that.
[30:58.21]Make... Okay, that's whatever.
[31:00.72]I'm gonna get so sick of this, though.
[31:04.94]He's a Minecraft diamond.
[31:09.78]He's a Minecraft diamond.
[31:13.35]That's fucking hilarious.
[31:27.45]Minecraft Diamond.
[31:30.49]Does it even- without the sliders, I didn't think they were going to exist for this game.
[31:40.38]Make him Mr. Emeril.
[31:41.52]No, he's Minecraft Diamond.
[31:59.08]Mr. Green?
[32:04.62]No, he's not Mr. Green.
[32:08.14]I know what Mr. Green's looks like.
[32:09.30]I wonder how he's doing.
[32:14.97]I wonder if we'll ever see him again.
[32:20.53]In person.
[32:23.80]I wonder if we'll ever see him in person doing something.
[32:28.97]I don't know.
[32:32.93]Maybe not.
[32:33.35]It depends on what Mr. Brains is up to.
[32:36.53]Alright, let's do the ears.
[33:04.12]He's just... This is just the Silver Surfer.
[33:08.84]What did the Silver Surfer do?
[33:10.28]What was his thing?
[33:12.20]He came in and he, like, marked the planets, right?
[33:14.72]For the big guy to eat.
[33:16.24]Isn't that what it was? ...
[33:31.54]Not wrong.
[33:32.38]That's what it was, right?
[33:33.30]Whoa, what the fuck?
[33:34.78]I didn't hit it.
[33:35.18]I thought I hit accept.
[33:50.03]My friend Joe is playing Saints Row 3 right now.
[33:52.17]Can you say hi to him?
[33:53.63]What's up, Joe?
[33:56.80]Goal.
[34:03.63]This is gonna get so irritating, you know it is.
[34:05.11]I don't know, why do I feel like this is, if a genie popped up and asked me a wish and I said, I want to be the most strong, super-powered man in history!
[34:22.52]You'd go like this and I would turn into that.
[34:25.76]Like, this would be what I turned into.
[34:37.92]This dude's made out of resin.
[34:41.24]Yeah, this guy's just gonna lie down on a wooden table.
[34:45.74]He'll be like, oh, nice!
[34:47.52]Nice, dude!
[35:09.89]Whoa, you can put their whole face up or down?
[35:17.68]Resin.
[35:21.22]Don't act like you have not fallen asleep to resin pour videos.
[35:25.10]Come on, dude.
[35:26.08]Really?
[35:27.55]Don't act like you're better than the rest of us.
[35:40.72]I want to have a really big mouth.
[35:56.76]Okay, I like that better.
[36:02.83]What's going on with his mouth?
[36:12.93]Alright, I'm happy with it.
[36:23.81]Let's suck the chin up though.
[36:36.32]Let's get like a really fucking big turkey neck.
[36:49.27]Alright, I'm happy with it.
[36:51.19]I'm not happy with the eyes though.
[36:55.31]Getting there.
[37:00.21]Getting there.
[37:02.73]Definitely getting there now.
[37:15.76]Just don't care.
[37:25.46]Oh my goodness.
[37:27.58]Okay.
[37:37.92]Whoa!
[37:39.82]Alright, maybe.
[37:41.52]Maybe.
[37:41.90]Yeah, it's Dr. Manhattan's fucking stepbrother.
[37:55.13]Resin pour No not resin porn resin pour But that I don't know if the hair is not doing it for me
[38:31.07]That's too easy though.
[38:32.13]Should I just be bald?
[38:51.58]I kind of like this.
[39:00.20]Should he have, like, contrasting hair?
[39:01.80]Or should it just be... No, not the Jerma colors.
[39:19.59]I don't know.
[39:19.89]What do you think?
[39:22.84]Make it your hair color.
[39:26.02]I guess that is kind of weird.
[39:28.64]Yeah, it is weird.
[39:30.86]These kind of characters never have facial hair.
[39:33.34]They never have beards, right?
[39:40.80]Ever.
[39:42.84]Can I make... You can't even see it.
[39:53.12]I want a big beard.
[40:00.54]Yeah, imagine Dr. Manhattan with a goatee.
[40:05.04]It just doesn't fucking work.
[40:06.72]It does not work.
[40:21.62]Porn stash.
[40:22.44]You can't even see it.
[40:23.55]Alright, what about if I do this?
[40:29.73]I can't even see it.
[40:30.47]Hold on.
[40:32.51]This one's the most full, but I need to do... Okay, wait.
[40:34.35]Can we see it if we change the color?
[40:42.13]It just kind of... Doesn't it kind of look like he painted the sun with marker?
[40:51.70]It just looks slightly more oiled.
[40:58.68]It's just spray paint.
[40:59.56]Yeah, it's just spray paint.
[41:01.91]Wait.
[41:03.49]Oh, that one shows up.
[41:10.20]That looks like shit, though.
[41:11.74]That looks awful.
[41:15.96]I don't like this at all.
[41:17.10]I really don't like it.
[41:31.43]I can't even see it.
[41:32.65]Doesn't matter.
[41:33.07]You can't see this either.
[42:14.54]I don't hate it.
[42:18.08]He looks like a fucking pro wrestler.
[42:21.64]Turn the reflection off on the skin.
[42:23.18]Dude, do you guys really care that much?
[42:31.85]I'm gonna play this for like five hours and never install it ever again.
[42:35.51]It doesn't really matter.
[42:43.38]Yeah, without, without.
[42:44.34]I kind of like the, the glistening kind of like car oil.
[43:03.38]Yeah.
[43:15.38]It's on.
[43:18.00]Personality.
[43:18.66]There's a McGriddler.
[43:19.82]Yeah.
[43:31.90]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[43:37.48]There's money involved.
[43:38.74]No, no, no.
[43:40.10]Fuck that.
[43:40.62]No, it's so easy.
[43:41.78]This is the funny thing that everybody does.
[43:44.58]This is a funny.
[43:45.08]This is the funny one.
[43:46.88]No.
[43:48.58]With a turbo powered boat.
[43:49.84]How come you can't buy stock in murder?
[43:52.04]Everywhere I go, people always want money.
[43:54.06]God damn it.
[44:03.89]I don't... So just do it.
[44:09.21]Can I change it later?
[44:11.09]Can I go back and change this if I want to?
[44:18.02]I can?
[44:18.34]Fine.
[44:19.52]Fucking hate it already.
[44:31.10]I do this shit all the time.
[44:35.13]I will just be walking around my house and I'll just start doing this.
[44:39.49]I swear to ask Holly.
[44:40.27]I swear to God.
[44:41.45]Like, I do that.
[44:46.66]No, not that.
[44:48.36]No.
[44:50.04]Nope.
[44:52.94]No.
[44:53.26]No.
[44:54.72]No.
[45:05.01]I do that too?
[45:05.65]I do that too?
[45:07.37]Okay.
[45:23.24]We're just gonna do that.
[45:29.43]I hate this character.
[45:30.83]What's this character's name?
[45:31.63]I forget.
[45:32.61]Resin?
[45:36.26]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[45:37.14]I'm ex- Okay, yeah.
[45:38.01]This is it, right?
[45:43.43]Resin table?
[45:51.68]Resin pour.
[45:52.20]That's in there.
[45:55.34]I'm gonna turn it off now.
[45:56.81]It's stupid.
[45:57.59]It's not even funny.
[45:59.55]What happened?
[46:00.42]This was funny like 10 years ago.
[46:01.84]No, to us.
[46:03.68]Burke's right.
[46:04.70]We traded our dicks in for pussies.
[46:06.68]Seriously.
[46:07.42]Movie deals, commercials.
[46:09.08]This is going to be the air of every single cutscene.
[46:11.02]Body spray and some ass tasting energy drink.
[46:16.23]No, it's... Oh my god.
[46:18.09]It's always about the money, Mr. Gat.
[46:20.81]Which is precisely why our employer wishes to speak with you.
[46:24.89]If you'll indulge us.
[46:29.88]Sounds like you.
[46:32.32]No, it actually doesn't.
[46:37.92]That's a tuber joke.
[46:42.04]Of course.
[46:46.30]A remarkable likeness.
[46:48.55]These visions are Viola and Kiki, and I am Philippe Laurent, chairman of a multinational organization called the Syndicate.
[46:55.43]Taz impression.
[46:58.47]Evidently not, or you would not have a problem.
[47:02.19]Perhaps you wonder why you are still breathing at this point.
[47:05.72]Actually, I wonder why my foot's not up your ass at this point.
[47:11.00]like it or not Mr. gatt our organization is expanding into still water I am offering you the chance to leverage your assets against your lives ladies we're streamed 2022 because you don't like the zombie voice come on relax in exchange for 66 of your monthly gross revenue that is before taxes of course no it sucks so make yourself a waffle we're done here
[47:42.32]And I had so hoped to come to a rational business arrangement.
[47:49.88]What?
[47:59.02]No, you're gonna get us all sucked out of the plane.
[48:02.95]What the hell's going on?
[48:08.49]Boss, you gotta bail.
[48:14.28]I definitely can't even change it.
[48:18.22]What a mistake.
[48:19.46]Yes, that's right, resin pour.
[48:21.20]Dr. Manhattan's stepbrother.
[48:41.24]with the power of costing $15,000.
[48:42.58]That's it.
[48:43.36]Screen shake.
[48:44.24]Ah, fuck.
[48:44.68]This fucking screen shake.
[49:08.49]Wait, oh, let's go.
[49:09.55]Dude, there's all this fucking screen shake.
[49:11.29]Find a parachute.
[49:12.39]Alright, let's go.
[49:38.60]There's so many people.
[49:39.54]What are these people doing?
[49:41.74]This fucking sensitivity is so low, goddamn.
[49:49.32]What the fuck is going on?
[49:50.20]I don't have any guns.
[50:09.58]What?
[50:14.22]Nice Minecraft aim.
[50:16.42]Dude, I'm holding... Look.
[50:19.67]I am holding down right now.
[50:21.57]Holding up.
[50:22.71]It's like pitching an airplane.
[50:34.87]Let's go.
[50:37.49]Johnny, we're about to jump.
[50:38.85]Resin hands.
[50:42.69]Right on.
[50:43.95]I'll see you in still.
[50:58.62]Johnny?
[51:04.47]I love how he goes off-camera for cutscenes like any of us care.
[51:09.53]Yeah, well, I don't know, I'm just used to doing it.
[51:14.13]What the fuck?
[51:31.11]This is so stupid.
[51:39.11]Flip!
[51:40.33]Flip!
[51:45.69]Flip!
[51:59.35]Reload, reload, reload, reload!
[52:05.99]Can I go faster?
[52:12.56]Can I get hurt?
[52:13.02]Alright, that hurts.
[52:19.06]What is going on?
[52:19.94]Got you.
[52:43.91]I can't change it.
[52:45.15]It's over.
[52:45.49]Oh man, why the fuck did I listen to the ten people telling me to do that?
[53:02.06]What's going on?
[53:02.50]Do I have to do something?
[53:05.56]Am I supposed to press a button?
[53:31.43]Dude, what the fuck?
[53:32.29]What?
[53:32.67]These guys look like they're gonna die.
[53:41.11]Oh, no they're not.
[53:50.06]What is this guy doing?
[53:56.28]Skip the cutscenes.
[53:59.25]This whole thing is a cutscene.
[54:00.33]It's the tutorial at the beginning of the game, man.
[54:12.42]This is the original, I think.
[54:13.48]I actually have no idea.
[54:15.04]I just bought Saints Row the Third.
[54:16.58]That's it.
[54:17.22]I didn't know anything else.
[54:20.04]I wasn't looking for a remaster.
[54:21.43]I didn't think they were going to remaster this game.
[54:33.74]We're falling for a really long time.
[54:35.26]Don't you only really fall when you, like, skydive?
[54:39.58]For 30 seconds or something?
[54:45.99]Don't you only fall for, like, 20 seconds?
[54:50.09]No.
[54:54.29]Three minutes?
[54:57.63]Why do I feel like you just get sucked to the ground wicked fast?
[55:01.38]Are you on drugs?
[55:01.84]How high do you jump out of a plane?
[55:04.70]When you skydive?
[55:05.44]I don't know.
[55:05.78]How high do you go?
[55:06.36]14,000 feet?
[55:33.70]Not as high as you are right now.
[55:35.86]I am sober.
[55:38.17]Sober.
[55:38.57]Oh, there's a phone.
[55:42.43]Okay.
[55:46.79]Stop leaving.
[55:47.73]We don't care about the cutscenes.
[55:49.31]Try to skip the cutscenes.
[55:51.89]But I'm not gonna know what's going on.
[55:53.05]Alright, let's go.
[55:58.86]Steal a car.
[56:02.10]How do I put the gun away?
[56:03.18]Don't skip cutscenes.
[56:03.84]Okay, access cell phone map.
[56:04.88]Oh my fucking god, get rid of it now.
[56:27.92]Okay.
[56:29.18]So this wants me to go see the GPS.
[56:30.56]Set the GPS to the, what, over here?
[56:32.38]Okay.
[56:33.06]Set GPS.
[56:36.35]Sounds good.
[56:36.73]Let's go.
[56:37.83]The car sucks.
[56:39.07]Why don't you just...
[56:56.04]I feel like that should not have- look, where the fuck are we going?
[56:59.30]What the fuck?
[57:00.38]That was a ro- that wasn't even a road.
[57:02.02]The ga- I can- you can get Luigi'd?
[57:07.09]Okay, you can actually get Luigi'd.
[57:08.59]Jump or dive.
[57:09.25]What the fuck was that?
[57:10.13]Oh my god, shut it off!
[57:12.89]Where's the- where- how do I get rid of it?
[57:31.62]I thought this lady farted.
[57:35.40]Like I scared the shit out of her.
[57:37.84]I was like, what?
[57:43.50]I thought she farted.
[57:48.79]I really, I honestly thought she farted.
[57:50.51]I was like, okay, it's like a comedy thing when you pull people out of their car and they like shit their pants.
[57:55.67]I don't know.
[57:56.81]I've never played this one.
[58:00.63]Can you get in trouble in this game?
[58:08.45]I don't think I can even get in trouble.
[58:09.99]Alright, I made it.
[58:25.07]Go to the plastic surgeon?
[58:25.97]Alright, we have to get through this tutorial first.
[58:29.39]Purchase weapon upgrade.
[58:33.31]Car crash is funny.
[58:39.96]Bat?
[58:41.80]I guess I'll have to buy the upgrade, right?
[58:46.43]Okay, level one.
[58:47.73]Purchase a weapon upgrade.
[58:48.67]Is there a way to do that?
[58:51.77]Buy upgrade weapons.
[58:54.05]This one.
[58:55.33]Level two.
[58:57.11]I have a hundred dollars.
[58:58.72]What?
[58:58.92]Oh, okay.
[59:09.32]Alright, go to the guard armory.
[59:12.01]Not far.
[59:12.47]It's on the GPS.
[59:17.04]Where's the car?
[59:19.16]Holy shit.
[59:22.60]What sprint?
[59:23.04]There's money all over the ground.
[59:30.33]R3 for melee?
[59:34.49]Watch out.
[59:35.53]There's a store called Image As Designed.
[59:37.42]Okay.
[59:44.28]Family Guy?
[59:44.88]Family Guy.
[59:45.20]Wait, is that it?
[59:45.70]I don't have any money.
[60:14.82]What's on fire?
[60:16.53]That's our car?
[60:23.09]Is she dead?
[60:24.71]No, you're fine.
[60:25.57]I can't lose on the tutorial.
[60:26.71]We're good.
[60:28.45]Alright, follow me.
[60:32.27]I didn't want to... I didn't want to do that.
[60:34.07]I thought... Whatever.
[60:35.81]I'm trying to... How do you sprint?
[60:40.20]Oh my fucking god.
[60:41.20]Now what?
[60:46.79]Left bumper?
[60:47.33]Alright.
[60:49.51]Do I have enough to change the voice?
[60:53.19]Alright.
[60:53.49]Change voice.
[60:54.99]Oh, come on, dude.
[60:56.11]Really?
[60:56.39]Alright.
[60:58.86]I know what it looks like now, though.
[61:11.72]Get off.
[61:16.40]Alright, get on.
[61:25.27]Let's move.
[61:26.71]How come I can't hear any acceleration sounds?
[61:28.69]That's what's weird to me.
[61:31.85]There's no... We're just floating.
[61:40.04]It's an electric motor?
[61:43.82]You're so slow.
[61:44.82]What?
[61:46.32]I'm not looking over here anymore because I keep, I just drive into shit.
[61:49.48]Stop.
[61:50.28]Let me do what I'm going to do.
[61:51.20]Okay.
[62:02.09]Let's go.
[62:02.43]Okay.
[62:15.97]Kill the guards, go!
[62:16.49]Get better aim!
[62:19.61]Can I fi- I need to- alright, you're- you're- Just get off, I got it.
[62:24.92]Red barrel, got it.
[62:45.01]I shot him a hundred times.
[62:49.48]Oh my god, this gun sucks.
[62:52.60]This gun sucks.
[62:57.39]Excuse me?
[63:14.45]Alright, good weapons.
[63:18.15]This gun is awful.
[63:19.83]This one's not.
[63:25.96]I'm sorry, I'm keyboard turning right now.
[63:27.72]I'm sorry.
[63:39.48]Holy shit.
[63:46.21]That was cool.
[63:54.11]The McShitter.
[63:54.63]It's making me... Is anybody else getting, like, angry?
[63:58.50]It's kind of angering, isn't it?
[64:16.37]Oh my god, there's so many people.
[64:18.89]What?
[64:19.13]Do I have a grenade or anything?
[64:20.14]This is too many people here.
[64:30.56]Oh my god, there's way too many people.
[64:32.38]Oh my god.
[64:46.52]Help, help, help!
[64:47.06]I need to get up!
[64:51.54]Help, help, help, help, help, help, help!
[64:53.06]I'm down!
[64:58.22]Use the what?
[65:02.41]Use the... Dude, I can't even... Half the sound effects are missing!
[65:05.45]Okay, is this really the time?
[65:06.95]Yeah.
[65:07.23]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[65:16.55]Alright, where's this thing you're talking about?
[65:21.24]Did you pirate the game?
[65:22.64]No!
[65:23.02]I didn't pirate the goddamn game!
[65:28.77]Hold?
[65:29.03]Do I just have to hold position?
[65:42.08]Something's missing.
[65:43.18]It's weird.
[65:44.04]Something is missing from the fucking game.
[65:50.50]I'm getting pissed.
[66:01.57]Oh my fucking god.
[66:02.67]Why are there a million people in here?
[66:05.95]There's no music and I feel like half the sound effects don't work.
[66:17.51]You think?
[66:18.69]Pierce, where are you?
[66:19.91]You know me.
[66:28.98]I love to make an entrance.
[66:33.14]Buy the remaster.
[66:33.92]Somebody said the people say the remaster sucks.
[66:42.55]If we're staying, maybe it's time
[66:45.99]See, yeah, this wasn't here before.
[66:47.29]Oh shit, don't pull it up!
[67:00.74]Oh fuck!
[67:03.94]It's alright, it's alright, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
[67:14.69]Oh my fucking god!
[67:30.72]Holy shit man, what the fuck is this game?
[67:56.09]How many people are here?
[67:58.35]There's too many people here to have seen that.
[68:01.67]Way too many people here to have witnessed that.
[68:05.78]I'm trying to kill the helicopters.
[68:07.14]Nice.
[68:20.33]Nice.
[68:32.01]Got him.
[68:48.67]Not dead.
[68:49.60]He'll be in a minute.
[68:52.72]This dude's doing CBD injections.
[69:07.11]Anymore?
[69:07.47]Alright, let's go, let's go, go, go, go, go, go.
[69:14.08]This dude's fuckin' scrunked.
[69:48.12]There's way too many helicopters flying too close.
[69:49.77]I just moaned.
[69:58.98]I could feel it.
[70:01.90]Actually, I know I just moaned.
[70:04.30]I know I did.
[70:34.57]How many helicopters do we have to shoot at?
[70:39.39]There's been more helicopters than people.
[70:41.15]Don't think these dollars are supposed to be spendin' like this.
[70:52.12]I see my exit plate.
[70:52.58]Take it down on the left.
[70:54.54]There's gonna be enough room for this shit, right?
[71:01.13]What you guys waitin' for?
[71:07.54]Alright, let's go.
[71:10.90]Just go play iPad games instead.
[71:12.30]Dude, you're having the nightmare stream where you expose yourself.
[71:19.27]Where I stand up and I'm just naked.
[71:23.43]It's just shit.
[71:24.95]This is how it started.
[71:32.53]Alright, I got money.
[71:33.31]Who is he talking to?
[71:34.57]I'm streaming.
[71:59.98]I need to quit the game and then disable and enable VSync in the NVIDIA control panel.
[72:05.71]Oh, goddammit.
[72:08.33]Stand up?
[72:09.05]No, I can't.
[72:10.35]I can't.
[72:10.85]I can't.
[72:11.19]I can't.
[72:11.51]I can't.
[72:11.87]I can't do it.
[72:12.27]I can't.
[72:15.23]I can't.
[72:15.45]I can't.
[72:15.67]I can't do it.
[72:18.82]Because I'm... Everyone knows me from here up.
[72:21.72]And I look professional.
[72:22.62]I look like I'm well done.
[72:24.92]I look well made, right?
[72:27.06]When I stand up, that illusion goes away.
[72:38.64]Because I'm wearing... Because I'm wearing the fucking god damn... I'm wearing the fucking Super Mario pajama pants again, alright?
[72:49.49]Is that what you wanted to see?
[73:08.42]Oh no, it happened.
[73:15.48]I have a new chair though.
[73:16.60]This thing's fucking really good.
[73:23.73]This is a Herman Miller chair.
[73:26.17]They actually, they sent it to me.
[73:29.27]Oh my god, my whole fucking life is changing.
[73:35.03]How many unlockables did I get?
[73:39.23]What?
[73:39.57]There's TF2 stuff in this game?
[73:46.63]Yeah.
[73:49.14]There's like 10 different adjustable knobs on this thing.
[73:54.90]Okay.
[73:55.74]Alright!
[73:56.28]Alright!
[73:56.74]Alright!
[73:57.08]Alright!
[73:57.40]Alright!
[73:58.04]Alright!
[73:58.72]Alright!
[73:59.22]Okay!
[74:00.51]Okay!
[74:06.13]Okay.
[74:13.50]Enough slices?
[74:18.05]Don't yell, I'm sorry.
[74:21.55]Alright, let's go.
[74:21.99]Hmm.
[74:27.19]Alright, weird science.
[74:36.88]He's got a pirated copy.
[74:50.06]That's all DLC?
[74:51.46]Oh, did I buy the DLC pack?
[74:55.40]Alright, let's go.
[74:55.98]Game is now open.
[75:00.70]Really?
[75:06.47]Is there a casino in this game?
[75:12.48]Where do I want to go?
[75:13.92]Where was that?
[75:14.86]There it is.
[75:15.76]It's so far away.
[75:18.84]Do these exist in all the little sections of the city?
[75:25.61]There's probably another one over here, right?
[75:27.69]Yeah.
[75:29.85]Unknown.
[75:30.43]Which one is it?
[75:32.49]Those of you that have played this game a lot.
[75:41.92]Because these are all unknown.
[75:46.34]Bottom one?
[75:48.26]Like right here?
[75:51.07]I'll check this one.
[75:51.75]That one?
[76:00.53]Go to the strip club.
[76:02.21]Why would you do that?
[76:02.95]Alright, that's a gun place.
[76:16.44]Is it this one?
[76:21.64]Check this one too.
[76:22.16]Top center.
[76:22.88]I thought you guys said it was the bottom one.
[76:26.20]Nope.
[76:26.38]Car place.
[76:27.07]Ah, whatever.
[76:47.22]I'm sure I'll get up there eventually.
[76:48.32]Go to the strip club and turn on face cam.
[76:49.92]What do you mean turn on the face cam?
[76:51.88]Alright, so what's this one?
[77:23.71]Do the iPad stream?
[77:24.47]The iPad stream is going to take a while to set up.
[77:25.95]I've got to get like 50 games.
[77:28.87]This is DLC.
[77:30.53]I'll only do face cam, I see.
[77:32.71]I never will.
[77:46.00]Trying to make a clone?
[78:29.24]That just took me by surprise.
[78:31.04]I forgot that was a person in the game.
[78:32.26]I was like, who the fuck is that guy?
[78:44.05]This is so fucking awesome!
[78:58.35]Robot chicken?
[79:02.03]Do I have enough firepower to do this?
[79:27.12]Hey, hey, hey.
[79:28.06]Hey, slow down.
[79:28.94]So wait, I gotta... Is it like a giant version of... Okay.
[79:33.54]Change the voice?
[79:34.36]I mean, I'm so far away from it.
[79:54.73]Okay.
[79:54.97]The next time I come across one, I will change it.
[79:57.43]I promise.
[79:57.85]You look crusty today.
[80:24.22]I'd rather be fucking crusty than soggy.
[80:31.44]Like wilted.
[80:32.12]Alright, so where is he?
[80:50.46]I was narrating this whole thing.
[80:52.42]Interrogate?
[80:52.86]Oh, get in.
[80:53.90]Alright, come here.
[80:55.78]How do I interrogate?
[81:23.16]Is your favorite food chicken?
[81:29.84]Oh, it's one of them.
[81:30.68]I was like, why did my voice change?
[81:32.49]I thought that was me talking.
[81:33.47]Okay.
[81:58.10]Why am I still holding this person?
[82:17.38]Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.
[82:18.70]Alright, let's go.
[82:44.03]I feel like I'm watching someone else watch someone play this game.
[82:49.29]Why?
[82:49.55]This is like a weird feeling I'm having.
[82:50.97]Like, I feel like I'm not playing.
[82:52.61]I'm like watching someone else play.
[82:57.83]Does that make any sense?
[82:58.82]Like, I don't know what it is with this game.
[83:00.26]Why Saints Row 3?
[83:01.62]I didn't feel that way in Saints Row 2.
[83:02.54]I feel like I'm watching someone play the game.
[83:10.47]No, I'm just saying it's like I feel like I haven't played the game yet.
[83:13.51]Does that make any sense?
[83:15.77]It's probably the camera shake.
[83:18.19]It's not the camera shake.
[83:36.75]Look at what you saints did to my club.
[83:38.79]Hold up, man.
[83:39.81]We didn't have nothing to do with it.
[83:49.40]I can't lose.
[83:49.84]Alright, where is he?
[83:54.48]Jesus!
[83:55.69]That big guy came in screaming his name and something about stripper poles and then started trashing the place.
[84:01.91]People panicked and he ran off.
[84:08.34]Okay.
[84:10.64]Why don't... What are you... What?
[84:12.20]We were not supposed to kill him.
[84:14.12]Alright, what is going on here?
[84:18.12]Get the fuck away from me.
[84:19.32]I thought we were not supposed to kill this guy.
[84:21.44]I didn't do that.
[84:35.22]Okay.
[84:40.26]Okay, grenade.
[84:45.50]Grenade out.
[84:46.56]Get out.
[84:54.41]Oh, be careful.
[84:57.63]I love the crow hop.
[85:05.46]This is DLC.
[85:06.54]Okay.
[85:06.96]Somebody said, dude, I wish somebody in chat would let me know if this was DLC or not.
[85:34.78]Okay.
[85:34.98]Where's Jimmy?
[85:35.55]Alright, let's go.
[85:37.19]Let's go.
[85:37.47]Let's get out.
[85:46.33]Out, out, out.
[86:05.16]Turn around, turn around.
[86:07.40]Get behind me.
[86:16.13]Shoot!
[86:16.65]Shoot!
[86:23.97]Alright, let's go.
[86:31.49]What the fuck are you doing?
[86:33.90]Hey!
[86:34.08]Dude, come on, man!
[86:56.50]When the fucking Uber pulls up, you don't, come on, don't, don't, now don't text me and say, Hey, where are you, man?
[87:02.66]I'm looking for you.
[87:03.88]You drove right by me.
[87:04.86]I have the GPS thing right there.
[87:06.42]I'm not, I don't want to walk a half mile to go find you now.
[87:09.81]Oh, this is a rocket launcher.
[87:18.89]Alright.
[87:21.46]What is this person doing?
[87:24.96]I don't have to even shoot at them, they're just gonna... What is it?
[87:29.50]Is it a monster?
[87:30.28]What the fuck was that?
[87:57.84]I thought he was going to be way bigger.
[87:59.98]Is it weird that I'm not intimidated at all?
[88:01.52]I thought he was going to be five times bigger.
[88:14.71]Protect the car.
[88:15.51]Alright.
[88:25.60]Discovering shortcuts update your GPS.
[88:27.68]Okay.
[88:27.80]What the fuck?
[88:34.58]Okay.
[89:21.15]Stop stop what what?
[89:21.95]There's too many rockets
[89:43.48]This game feels like a fever dream I'll tell you I feel like I haven't played the game Am I out of ammo no
[90:07.05]I feel like somebody is describing Saints Row 3 to me right now.
[90:11.17]And I'm, like, imagining what you're describing.
[90:14.46]Like, I'm sitting there listening to you be like, yeah, man, so we're in the car.
[90:16.74]One of the missions, you drive around, you shoot the rocket launcher and stuff.
[90:19.46]Dude, it's fucking Saints Row.
[90:20.36]And I'm just sitting there going, okay, I'm picturing that, what that is.
[90:50.59]Don't play the D- Well, this was in the beginning of the game too.
[90:53.01]I feel like I've been hanging out of a window.

[90:59.18]Oh, this car is gonna explode.
[91:09.96]There's so many things.
[91:10.96]What the fuck is happening, man?
[91:23.52]No, no, this is the real long play that the world is doing to me right now.
[91:26.70]See, I'm gonna wake up.

[91:41.15]This can't be real.
[91:43.45]And I'm gonna look over at chat and everyone's gonna be screaming that I did it.
[91:49.64]This was the long dream.
[91:50.94]This was the long con that my dream was pulling.
[92:07.45]Do you have to imagine just sitting here sleeping?
[92:09.83]I'm just sitting here like... But that means I would have had to have turned the stream on, right?

[97:58.27]That's what that was.
[98:07.32]That was a blast from the past.

[98:25.46]The top is the mission.
[98:26.27]Okay, let's do this one.
[98:30.35]Your character's looking thick.
[98:37.07]Why is that helmet coming off?
[98:40.48]Why was that so brutal for that one guy?
[98:46.88]That was unnecessary.
[98:47.72]I know about the... I know I gotta change the voice.
[98:49.68]Okay, look.
[98:50.04]It's taking me over here.
[99:06.26]Is there one on the way?
[99:10.61]Is this one?
[99:11.67]Is this it right here?
[99:12.27]Or is there one closer?
[99:14.41]I don't think there's one closer.
[99:17.93]Let's go to this one.
[99:18.45]I feel like it's probably this one.
[99:22.25]Yeah.
[99:24.40]Let's move.
[99:31.54]I was just not going to stop.
[99:33.78]I didn't care.
[99:34.40]I was not stopping.
[99:39.00]Holding the brake was going to be too hard.
[99:41.20]I was too lazy to.
[99:42.56]Alright, so what's up?
[100:04.39]This is not one either.
[100:07.83]Really?
[100:08.13]Come on.
[100:15.89]This one?
[100:21.63]Just go west.

[100:29.13]I'll try this one.
[100:29.61]This one's close.
[100:31.15]I need a new car, though.
[100:31.99]This thing's annoying.
[100:49.98]Okay.
[100:52.12]Watch out.
[100:53.36]What's the horn?
[101:03.07]Sprint and steal to get in faster.
[101:04.41]Oh, that's true.
[101:06.59]You're right.
[101:11.29]Alright.
[101:12.77]I'm just getting lied to over and over again.
[101:14.94]I'm just going to go to the mission.
[101:26.16]Everyone said that one, that one, that one, that one, that one, that one, that one, that one, that one.
[101:29.48]There's probably like two in the whole map.
[101:42.71]What a smooth ride.
[102:07.96]I found one!
[102:10.97]I didn't want to shoot the gun, I wanted to punch him.
[102:19.11]Okay.
[102:20.55]Voice.

[103:05.03]I'm resin poor.
[103:09.66]Somebody give me a car.
[103:14.04]Okay.
[103:14.70]Thank you.
[103:19.45]That'd be so fucked up.
[103:21.99]Can you imagine seeing that?
[103:28.25]If you watch that happen, it's like, hey, whoa, they're just gone already.
[103:42.84]Alright, let's do it.
[103:44.04]Mission time.
[103:48.85]Oh, right, the title says McGriddler.
[103:50.21]It's not even accurate.
[103:51.31]This car can use a little tuning.

[124:18.19]Every sound effect in this game.
[124:19.64]And I'm gonna put on, like, gameplay, no commentary, an hour on Dust Bowl.
[124:25.24]Put that on in the background.
[124:26.34]Put the music in the background.
[124:27.32]And then put a bunch of medic voice lines that are just going to play.
[124:30.10]I think that's what I want to do.
[124:35.82]How come you're not eating pirate's booty on stream?
[124:40.01]I don't know.
[124:41.53]Why would I be doing that?
[124:47.83]The mods are just on top of it.
[124:49.99]This is great.
[124:56.13]Alright, I'm gonna tell you, this is my first day sitting in this new chair.
[125:07.78]This is way better than the thing I had before.
[125:12.12]Alright, so this chair...
[125:15.43]You can turn a knob.
[125:17.50]And it like... It pushes the kind of spine support thing into your back.
[125:25.42]It just like kind of wedges you in.
[125:26.62]Yeah, it's Herman Miller.
[125:31.55]I'm not sponsoring anything.
[125:32.93]I just was in the market for a new chair.
[125:37.13]And I mean, I guess you could say this is... I mean, if you want to call it a sponsorship.
[125:42.31]I wasn't paid to say anything about it, but...
[125:46.35]I got a chair.
[125:49.41]So, that's fucking cool.
[125:55.87]So yeah, this chair was provided to me.
[125:58.25]By Herman Miller.
[125:59.37]If you want me to say that, right?
[126:01.17]That's kind of what I should be saying.
[126:11.31]But it's fucking awesome.
[126:13.16]They are expensive, but... I mean... You should review cigarettes.
[126:23.84]They are very, very expensive.
[126:31.75]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[126:33.43]We're not doing that song.
[126:35.33]I don't know.
[126:35.73]We're doing the T.F.
[126:36.51]Tooth joke.
[126:39.65]Will that work here?
[126:48.35]This is gonna fall so flat, I think.
[126:50.71]But, whatever.
[126:55.11]How flat do you think this is gonna be?
[126:57.05]Let's find out.
[127:02.16]Okay.
[127:03.26]Red medic dust ball gameplay, no commentary.
[127:05.98]Medic voice lines.
[127:07.06]It's just everything here.
[127:07.98]Alright, let's get it ready.
[127:13.39]Uh-uh.
[127:18.98]How's that?
[127:21.42]This is fucking stupid.
[127:26.65]Charge me, Herr Doktor!
[127:28.07]Ready for the charge, Herr Doktor!
[127:29.79]Now is the time, Herr Doktor!
[127:31.98]Another successful procedure!
[127:34.58]They are weakened!
[127:35.94]I am prepared to do whatever it takes!
[127:38.56]How embarrassing!
[127:39.94]They let the man of science escape with the papers!
[127:42.22]Papers, please!
[127:43.60]Where are your precious papers now, dumb cops?
[127:46.74]Ready to charge!
[127:48.30]I am fully charged!
[127:49.80]I am charged!
[127:50.84]This is unacceptable!
[127:52.86]Anyone still alive?
[127:54.50]Let me down!
[127:56.51]Fire!
[127:58.71]Fire!
[127:59.47]Fire!
[128:00.25]Fire!
[128:01.05]I am on fire, everyone!
[128:05.41]I am on fire!
[128:07.88]I am melting!
[128:23.28]You must be stopped!
[128:28.40]Stay close to the cart!
[128:29.48]PUSH! PUSH!
[128:29.82]EVERYONE!
[128:30.24]PUSH!
[128:33.24]PUSH!
[128:34.92]EVERYONE!
[128:37.02]PUSH THE CART!
[128:49.74]He keeps talking!
[128:50.84]What?
[129:05.26]It's a spy!
[129:06.18]It's a spy!
[129:06.84]The soldier is a spy!
[129:09.20]The heavy is a spy!
[129:10.88]The iron is a spy!
[129:12.93]The Demoman is a spy!
[129:15.57]The spy is a double agent!
[129:16.75]The enemy is a spy!
[129:17.95]The engineer is a spy!
[129:20.41]The sniper is a spy!
[129:22.29]Stay!
[129:23.03]Stay!
[129:23.73]Bounce!
[129:24.31]Bounce!
[129:25.17]Move!
[129:25.65]Stay!
[129:26.39]You're a fighter!
[129:27.49]Bounce!
[129:27.87]Bounce!
[129:29.75]Everyone's a spy!
[129:31.29]Shit!
[130:07.04]Must I defend this point myself?
[130:09.28]Defend the point!
[130:11.38]Incoming!
[130:12.30]Incoming!
[130:13.46]Incoming!
[130:14.26]Bird head domination!
[130:16.70]I have a bird head!
[130:18.12]You're dominated!
[130:19.80]We're both having a bad day.
[130:22.03]I am Achmedes!
[130:23.93]I experimented on my own head!
[130:28.32]My head!
[130:31.06]The bird head is pure agony!
[130:33.66]It's a bird!
[130:36.77]It's a head!
[130:37.89]It's a bird head!
[130:39.77]Help me!
[130:44.79]Bird head was a bad choice.
[130:48.29]I toiled in God's domain.
[130:51.44]I am the angry bird god of the Badlands!
[130:55.06]Fear me!
[130:59.00]Okay, I can't fucking do it anymore.
[131:00.98]It's too much.
[131:01.74]Why don't you push?
[131:03.26]Who stopped pushing the cart?
[131:05.80]Your fault.
[131:07.63]I have two minds about this.
[131:09.97]Both are pretty good with it.
[131:12.57]Do you ever worry you might be going mad?
[131:17.19]Okay, that's enough.
[131:19.13]Do you ever think that you might be going mad?
[131:23.63]That's enough.
[131:25.37]I think my chest hurts.
[131:28.16]When he's talking about his head... Help me push the point.
[131:31.60]Oh my god, that's so fucking funny.
[131:36.78]Okay, well, let's get back to this.
[131:41.91]Yeah, no cam for that one.
[131:44.39]I think the bit needs to play out.
[131:50.91]My head!
[131:51.59]My head!
[131:52.19]My head!
[131:57.88]Okay.
[132:03.64]This is, okay, now this is like, this is like strange to me now.
[132:10.49]This is, isn't this a little weird now?
[132:12.05]I feel like I did, I did, I put on another song.
[132:29.42]Whatever.
[132:30.62]Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[132:41.49]Quick, I.E.U.
[132:42.11]I.E.U.
[132:57.26]What am I doing?
[132:58.72]What the fuck did I do that for?
[133:00.14]I don't know why I did that.
[133:05.86]I started coughing and just did it.
[133:07.10]My head!
[133:07.40]My head!
[133:07.72]Okay, we're good.
[133:08.60]Back to it.
[133:26.73]We need to start Dust Bowl again.
[133:28.33]What a fucking amazing game.
[133:31.85]It's so good.
[133:35.15]It's so good.
[133:36.87]Right, you know what I mean?
[133:37.63]There'll never be another Team Fortress.
[133:39.73]Ever.
[133:40.07]It's impossible.
[133:41.35]You know what I think?
[133:41.95]I can give you a take here.
[133:44.43]Everybody that thinks that, oh my god, Half-Life, Half-Life, Half-Life, Half-Life, Half-Life.
[133:48.67]It's gonna be so hard to make another Half-Life.
[133:50.17]No, no, absolutely.
[133:51.15]Team Fortress 2, there'll never be another TF2.
[133:56.84]It'll be impossible to make TF3.
[133:58.96]I feel strongly about that versus Half-Life 3.
[134:01.75]I think they could do a Half-Life 3 and be fine.
[134:03.91]I don't think they could do a TF3.
[134:06.81]That game was perfect.
[134:09.49]It was perfect.
[134:11.97]It was a perfect video game.
[134:18.34]So now I'm more afraid about them trying to do TF3.
[134:20.98]If they ever decide to, right?
[134:25.27]I mean, what is going on right now?
[134:30.14]That's a based high take.
[134:33.92]Just the characters, the voice work, the... It was like this whole world that they created, and they didn't have to do anything.
[134:41.11]You know what the craziest part about TF2 really was?
[134:45.39]There was this overarching kind of storyline, right?
[134:48.61]But it really lived in the background.
[134:51.32]And the characters made everything.
[134:54.00]The characterization of the classes made the... You kind of got to... Hold on, sorry.
[135:00.20]I'm like... I hear like music.
[135:01.78]It's like the characters were the whole thing.
[135:04.64]You didn't even need a story.
[135:07.74]And there was just enough overarching stuff in the background that made it perfect.
[135:14.90]If I could... Okay, okay.
[135:16.21]I got three wishes.
[135:16.83]If a genie came in front of me and was like... Hello, Cherma.
[135:20.31]Good to see you.
[135:21.41]I'm the genie, and you have three wishes.
[135:23.65]I would... Okay, here's what I'd wish for.
[135:24.83]I'd wish for, like, literally world peace and world hunger.
[135:30.00]And make Team Fortress 3 as good as TF2.
[135:32.46]There you go.
[135:33.36]Those are my three wishes.
[135:34.44]And by the way, release it in, like, six months.
[135:35.88]Are you... Where's this... Where is this person?
[135:47.31]Are you upstairs?
[135:47.95]What the fuck?
[135:49.99]Where are they?
[135:50.67]I didn't... Look, I'm sorry.
[136:16.10]You should wish for more stuff.
[136:18.19]Well, I mean... You can't wish for more wishes.
[136:21.39]Let's go.
[136:50.71]Follow what?
[136:51.29]Did I fail?
[136:52.91]No, okay, we're good.
[136:54.40]I failed?
[136:54.94]What happened?
[136:55.44]What the fuck just happened?
[136:58.52]What?
[136:58.78]Oh my god, I can't do a cool action jump.
[137:00.98]We hurt so bad.
[137:01.78]Alright, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[137:23.16]Am I calling somebody?
[137:36.71]Crash your helicopter into him.
[137:52.25]I thought about it, but I don't think I can reach him.
[137:59.74]Oh, shit.
[138:01.56]I'm fine, everything's fine.
[138:18.81]I don't... I don't care.
[138:20.39]I don't care.
[138:25.11]I don't care.
[138:25.97]Whatever.
[138:26.37]Everyone's yelling at me.
[138:27.35]God, yell at me.
[138:28.01]I don't care.
[138:29.73]I don't care.
[138:30.45]It's fine.
[138:31.33]I don't care.
[138:31.97]I don't care.
[138:35.07]I don't care.
[138:38.67]People are like, oh my god, he must care.
[138:39.97]I don't care at all.
[138:41.15]I don't care.
[138:41.73]Go.
[138:42.71]Go.
[138:57.58]Alright, don't be an idiot.
[138:59.54]I'm just at full throttle.
[139:03.43]Okay, now I feel like I'm playing the game, right?
[139:05.65]Like the last 45 minutes.
[139:06.27]Someone needs a nap.
[139:32.46]What are you talking about?
[139:34.11]I don't care.
[140:04.92]Whoa, shooting shit at me.
[140:25.07]Okay, so let's go.
[140:30.92]He crashed!
[140:31.62]What?
[140:31.76]Do I have to land?
[140:36.23]Looks like these things are on a coded timer and the clock's ticking.
[140:38.87]You got him yet?
[140:39.81]Just finish cleaning up.
[140:40.79]I'll get the codes.
[140:41.57]Nope.
[140:42.07]No codes.
[140:42.89]Just four wires.
[140:43.89]Red, green, blue, and black.
[140:46.08]Yeah, I'll get back to you then.
[140:50.56]Goddammit, I don't have time for these assholes.
[140:53.12]Come here.
[140:56.56]How do I defuse the bomb?
[141:09.92]No one beats a straight.
[141:12.16]Whoa, somebody's phone's ringing.
[141:14.72]Let's fire the gun.
[141:16.74]Damn, I lost the bet.
[141:18.58]Come on, Danny.
[141:19.34]Did I lose?
[141:21.09]Oh, now I got it.
[141:28.33]The Saints aren't going to back down.
[141:31.13]Matty, there's nothing to worry about.
[141:33.97]My thoughts exactly, Mr. Kilbane.
[141:36.21]The Saints are no more than a white noise of empty sights.
[141:43.48]With respect, sir... I'd say empty is no longer applicable.
[142:02.22]I forgot that it's in the cutscenes.
[142:03.52]I completely glazed over that.
[142:06.78]Meg's a fucking psycho.
[142:17.18]Cool.
[142:23.91]The sound of progress, my friend.
[142:33.31]Oh, I own this place now.
[142:35.56]Okay.
[142:41.20]Stun gun?
[142:45.47]Can we... Wait a minute.
[142:46.75]What the Saints wear, what vehicles they drive, and their taunts.
[142:51.84]Are you telling me that I can make a full Team Fortress 2 gang?
[142:59.83]Please don't tell me that.
[143:00.83]Because that's all I care about for the rest of the whole day.
[143:06.93]How do I do that?
[143:08.13]Where do I do that?
[143:16.91]It's only pre-made costumes?
[143:18.20]Aww, okay.
[143:19.30]Alright, access the crib.
[143:32.26]Let's find out.
[143:34.61]Wardrobe.
[143:44.41]Okay.
[143:46.07]Gang.
[143:47.98]style okay oh no you can't no it's alright you can't oh well oh well oh well okay it's alright I mean everyone's gonna get the dumper though that's very important
[144:17.18]What about that car?
[144:23.12]Yep.
[144:24.60]Yep.
[144:25.82]Yeah.
[144:34.27]Maybe I should upgrade some guns.
[144:43.40]Alright, damage.
[144:44.74]Bullet damage?
[144:45.40]I mean, why not?
[144:46.56]5% reduction in damage taken from bullets.
[144:50.46]10% reduction in damage when hit by a vehicle.
[144:52.37]Eh.
[144:53.93]I got 14 grand.
[144:57.09]Ooh, explosive ammo.
[145:00.57]Grenade.
[145:00.93]Carry 25% more grenades.
[145:02.33]Yeah.
[145:06.23]More pistol ammo.
[145:06.96]More shotgun.
[145:07.58]More SMG.
[145:09.08]Meleeing enemies throws them slightly further.
[145:11.06]Yeah.
[145:13.80]Yes.
[145:17.10]Okay.
[145:17.92]Don't spend all my money.
[145:20.16]Bonuses.
[145:21.46]Hourly city income.
[145:22.67]500 bucks?
[145:24.79]Yeah, I'll take it.
[145:28.57]Pay cash for 4,000 respect.
[145:33.43]What about... Okay, gang abilities.
[145:36.35]Vehicle delivery.
[145:38.61]Yep, I like that.
[145:41.33]You should do mods.
[145:44.32]Maybe I'll do like an insane mod day.
[145:47.92]You know, yeah, let's write that down.
[145:50.08]I'm gonna do just a wacky mod day where I pick up a few games that have just never-ending mods and just ruin them and play like three or four games.
[146:00.98]Because, okay, here's the problem.
[146:02.73]Once you start turning on mods that are crazy, the game's over.
[146:07.11]You're not playing the game anymore.
[146:08.47]There's no going back to like, oh, I'm going to use the pistol and do the mission.
[146:11.63]It's not going to happen anymore.
[146:13.45]So, you got to give yourself like an hour or two to play in the mod playground and then move on.
[146:19.96]So, we'll do it.
[146:23.84]We'll do a cookie mod night.
[146:27.63]We'll do it soon.
[146:30.79]Can I parachute off this?
[146:31.51]Alright, that's pretty cool.
[146:46.31]Ooh, answer cell phone.
[146:48.35]They're attacking our crib.
[146:49.86]Alright, you got it.
[146:50.66]I'm on my way.
[147:07.28]I didn't even see that.
[147:09.74]Wait, they're up here?
[147:10.78]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[147:30.59]Oh my god, give me the car.
[147:31.33]Did you actually get in the car?
[147:33.31]What's up?
[148:17.16]Put her down, put her down, put her down, put her down, put her down.
[148:21.88]Get out, get out.
[148:27.15]What are you doing?
[148:27.89]What are you doing?
[148:29.83]Why?
[148:29.93]Where?
[148:55.11]Oh shit!
[149:02.43]Go!
[149:04.93]Alright, I did the mission, right?
[149:07.92]We're good.
[149:16.28]Alright, cool.
[149:17.49]New mission.
[149:18.49]What do I want to do next?
[149:20.43]Guardian Angel.
[149:21.15]Let's do this one.
[149:24.84]Let's go to the HQ.
[149:25.68]They said, this is boring, I wanna watch you gamble.
[149:28.76]Oh.
[149:28.88]Um... I mean, I know a guy that does a lot of gambling.
[149:53.88]I've got to know him a little bit over the last few years.
[150:02.53]Yeah.
[150:04.39]Okay, let's do it.
[150:23.80]Check it out, boss.
[150:25.14]What's up?
[150:26.12]Since this used to be a syndicate crib, I thought I'd poke around and see what they left behind.
[150:30.40]No one's getting any more hints.
[150:33.06]Now, shut up.
[150:35.32]The syndicate will know we have the keys.
[150:37.56]They'll be waiting for us to make a move.
[150:39.70]I guess then you better watch my back.
[150:42.23]Alright, let's go.
[150:46.68]Oh, hanging out of the fucking chopper, shooting grenades at people, hanging out of the side of the fucking window.
[150:52.80]Why do I have control for that?
[151:08.39]Just keeping you on your toes.
[151:10.39]Stop driving into my missiles!
[151:44.89]I can't even aim that far.
[151:52.98]I can't aim that far.
[152:11.64]Air shot!
[152:12.10]I got it.
[152:12.58]I actually got it.
[152:13.42]How do I heal your car?
[152:33.69]Well, drive by them!
[152:35.23]Your car is fucked up, man.
[152:38.45]They're blocking the road up here.
[152:39.85]Help me out.
[152:49.55]Where?
[152:49.79]I stopped flying the helicopter so far.
[152:52.50]You idiot.
[152:54.20]We're going, mouse, for this.
[152:55.52]The sensitivity is so high.
[153:20.93]You haven't been touched once.
[153:29.61]Relax.
[153:51.73]Come on, move!
[154:26.89]Stop hiding behind the car.
[154:57.43]I'll find a place to set up.
[155:05.56]Oh, right in the middle.
[155:19.61]What?
[155:29.89]Best around.
[155:59.33]Why would you pull up that close?
[156:06.99]Oh shit, they got him.
[156:21.89]Oh shit.
[156:30.42]I love this.
[156:54.32]I think his mate saw me.
[156:56.84]Yes, yes he did.
[157:00.10]God, we're in a Team Fortress 2 movie today, huh?
[157:11.07]Only two grand for that?
[157:12.03]What the hell?
[157:14.07]That's kind of bullshit if you ask me.
[157:15.41]$82 per hour.
[157:19.53]What?
[157:29.50]Oh, this is... I don't want to do this again.
[157:40.52]Jerm, are you good at sniping?
[157:43.41]Yeah, just wait till you see my raw snipes in the fucking... Mizgiv $100,000 Smite Tournament on the 27th.
[158:00.30]What happened over here?
[158:08.55]What are these people doing?
[158:09.49]What's wrong with you?
[158:14.89]Oops.
[158:26.83]Alright, mission, let's go.
[158:31.16]Uh, this one.
[158:32.92]That was fucking funny.
[158:35.41]I thought you weren't gonna play Smite anymore?
[158:37.81]I didn't say that.
[159:05.75]I didn't say that.
[159:06.29]When did I say that?
[159:13.27]You literally did.
[159:13.93]Smite Thursdays.
[159:31.17]What sort of things we have to sell off?
[159:32.87]I'm driving?
[159:33.63]No, he's driving.
[159:34.77]Oh, he threw a grenade.
[159:35.43]I must have just drove into a tree as fast as they could.
[159:38.60]Why?
[159:38.86]Let's do some business.
[159:40.10]Get the fuck out of here!
[160:00.23]Alright, let's get a deal done.
[160:14.30]Protect the dealer and the buyer.
[160:15.50]You got it.
[160:18.36]This saint's biography is signed by the whole crew.
[160:26.76]Give me some pickles and I'll wear anything.
[160:31.56]Protected.
[160:39.46]Let's go.
[160:40.54]Will you shoot this fucking guy, please?
[160:45.84]Alright, let's go.
[160:48.18]New deal.
[160:48.48]Give me advice on closing the deal?
[160:49.88]Yeah.
[160:50.64]Hold a gun to their head.
[160:51.98]I don't think that'll work.
[160:55.61]I'm not driving the car.
[160:58.49]No, you're pretty good at driving.
[160:59.92]This car has beat the fuck up bad.
[161:06.60]Will you just stop already?
[161:11.80]Finally.
[161:12.08]Nah, it's no big of a deal.
[161:24.56]Something wrong with your eyes?
[161:30.30]You get out of the car.
[161:31.08]Haha, stupid.
[161:34.12]Don't fuck with the saints.
[161:39.61]It just turned right into the... In these universes, I would never want to walk anywhere.
[161:47.83]Everyone's just driving into people.
[161:52.25]I'm literally not going anywhere.
[161:59.61]I gotta go over there.
[162:01.71]Oh, he left without paying.
[162:12.12]Did we get him?
[162:18.63]These people are fucking pissing me off.
[162:20.93]Did I just make them so angry?
[162:22.33]Wait, did he...
[162:32.77]You and me now.
[162:36.75]Don't worry, I'll get you.
[162:39.13]Can I drown him?
[162:39.71]Don't let him leave.
[162:43.11]Um.
[162:45.62]You fucking saints.
[162:51.48]Let's get this shit started.
[162:56.47]Alright, let's go.
[163:05.44]Alright, take their co- Drive!
[163:13.02]Get us out of here!
[163:14.67]What are you doing?
[163:18.53]Where is he going?
[163:21.39]You're going to get into melee range.
[163:26.20]Where is he going?
[163:42.12]Oh my goodness, I snapped his neck.
[163:48.38]This is fucking brutal.
[163:56.65]Can we leave?
[163:58.75]Can we leave?
[164:00.39]Just get in the car and let's leave.
[164:02.31]Okay.
[164:05.11]I pissed these people off so bad.
[164:08.22]They're never going to leave me alone.
[164:13.70]They're never gonna leave me alone.
[164:14.74]Is there a reason why you're going 20?
[164:27.08]You good?
[164:44.39]I'm just like, I don't even want to be here.
[165:00.92]Two grand, let's go.
[165:05.40]Six respect.
[165:07.24]Pretty good.
[165:12.73]Ban the spammers, ban the spammers, ban the spammers, ban the spammers.
[165:19.90]Cool.
[165:21.44]What's next?
[165:21.86]Alright, now let's take over the city.
[165:30.42]If we're gonna get a cash flow going, we'll need a business to funnel us money.
[165:33.79]You wanna rob some store?
[165:34.95]That'll cause more problems than it's worth.
[165:37.01]I'm saying we buy one from the Morningstar.
[165:38.99]Yeah, because they'll jump at the chance to sell to us.
[165:42.53]Spam the banners?
[165:55.13]Call the banners.
[165:55.81]Alright, if I called the banners, would you guys come to my aid?
[166:01.36]Like, if I made a World of Warcraft account, and I was like, call the banners!
[166:05.60]I want gold from everybody.
[166:07.64]Would it work?
[166:07.94]Would it work?
[166:14.70]No.
[166:15.56]Yeah, it would.
[166:16.54]Why wouldn't it?
[166:22.58]I mean, I'm never going to play World of Warcraft.
[166:24.62]Don't worry.
[166:28.66]Oh my god.
[166:29.61]This is a nice car.
[166:54.50]You still did Shadowlands.
[166:57.01]I literally installed it.
[167:00.45]Played it for like a week.
[167:02.33]And didn't do anything.
[167:11.51]If it was an FPS game, maybe I would.
[167:24.10]A whole week?
[167:26.87]I mean, what the hell?
[167:31.33]Why did they have to do that cutscene?
[167:32.43]It's a hundred bucks?
[167:43.28]$500 per hour?
[167:44.58]That's a huge deal.
[167:45.24]Remember, you fucked the whole thing up.
[167:46.88]Alright, I want some new stuff.
[167:48.80]Grenades, level 2.
[167:49.40]No, that's way too much money.
[167:51.25]What about... Is there any melee weapons I can buy?
[167:53.97]$27,000.
[167:53.99]No way.
[168:13.90]Mollusk launcher?
[168:18.68]Where do I get that?
[168:23.08]I like the shotgun.
[168:25.65]What is this thing?
[168:26.85]The Shark-O-Matic?
[168:30.01]What are these weird cartoon guns?
[168:31.67]These are TF2 guns.
[168:34.75]I need them.
[168:44.78]Ooh, give me this thing.
[168:45.92]Yeah.
[168:48.72]I'll take that.
[168:54.16]Five grenades.
[169:00.37]Let's go.
[169:01.09]What have we got in here?
[169:05.93]Cool.
[169:08.47]You already own the shark one.
[169:10.87]I do?
[169:14.78]What the fuck?
[169:17.47]What are these?
[169:20.13]All DLC weapons or something?
[169:26.45]I already own them.
[169:28.76]Well, I'm gonna equip them, why not?
[169:32.10]Buy ammo.
[169:37.34]There's only one shot?
[169:39.46]Okay, well I'm kind of concerned.
[169:41.83]Let's go.
[169:52.75]find the sex doll who's talking oh
[170:08.80]Somebody died.
[170:09.62]Somebody died.
[170:10.28]Did I just kill that person?
[170:13.08]No, that's not fair.
[170:13.67]That's not fair.
[170:15.55]They were already dead in the road.
[170:17.07]I didn't kill that person.
[170:19.63]They already were dead in the road.
[170:20.97]That shouldn't be attributed to me.
[170:36.72]I don't... I hate that thing.
[170:37.92]I don't want that.
[170:38.36]Alright, find the sex doll.
[170:41.57]Okay.
[170:47.60]Collectibles.
[170:47.92]Don't you dare.
[170:48.28]I didn't do anything.
[170:48.82]This guy's pissed behind us.
[170:49.72]Alright, estates.
[171:18.31]I'm so sorry.
[171:19.97]Rick and Morty?
[171:24.00]Rick and Morty.
[171:33.42]I have a question for all you guys.
[171:35.10]For all you negative Andes.
[171:38.80]Negative Andes.
[171:39.38]I have a question.
[171:44.24]Did he say, go fuck yourself?
[171:46.46]Um... Okay, listen.
[171:49.65]Do you... Be honest.
[171:50.57]I want you to be completely honest with me.
[171:52.09]Don't lie to me.
[171:52.83]Don't act like a dick.
[171:54.23]Just be honest.
[171:55.41]Please.
[171:57.43]Do you... Did you think... I don't know.
[172:00.05]They're like, oh, your friends are watching, so you have to type carefully because they're going to hear.
[172:05.19]Did you think that season 1 and 2 of Rick and Morty was good?
[172:15.78]Come on.
[172:16.28]I want you to be honest with me.
[172:23.09]Yeah.
[172:23.75]Yeah.
[172:25.09]Okay.
[172:25.49]Alright.
[172:29.85]Okay.
[172:30.91]Alright.
[172:31.29]So then... So then we can agree, right?
[172:34.83]Okay.
[172:37.74]Right.
[172:40.45]Up until the Pickle Rick episode is when I liked it.
[172:45.91]You know what?
[172:48.59]I really think it was when that copypasta was first created, everybody didn't want to watch the show anymore.
[172:56.29]I think that's when it was.
[172:57.01]I think everybody collectively all went, fuck.
[173:09.04]I think that's what it was.
[173:17.46]That one guy ruined everything.
[173:26.56]You know what it was for me?
[173:29.25]I think what it was for me was the sauce thing.
[173:31.89]Right?
[173:33.47]It was like, where's my sauce?
[173:36.03]I think that's what it was for me.
[173:39.54]I remember seeing the sauce thing and I was like, fuck.
[173:43.18]Fuck.
[173:44.32]Can I like this show anymore?
[173:45.96]I feel like I can't anymore.
[173:51.09]What the fuck?
[173:53.95]I am the greatest!
[173:57.61]What the hell does this weapon do?
[174:02.01]Good times.
[174:03.31]Everywhere else they do business?
[174:04.69]Yeah, up to the north.
[174:13.62]What the fuck just happened, man?
[174:19.84]What happened?
[174:22.10]I'm so confused.
[174:23.30]I don't even know how to play the game anymore.
[174:25.28]That was never supposed to happen in my life.
[174:28.50]That was never a thing that was ever going to happen on screen.
[174:32.36]I was about to say this weapon sucks.
[174:34.74]Okay.
[174:40.41]The Venture Brothers are good.
[174:43.33]All the old Adult Swim shows were awesome.
[174:48.21]I actually don't really like new Adult Swim.
[174:50.62]I'm older, right?
[174:53.08]Am I just older and I don't care?
[174:57.92]Or is this my Boomer Andy here?
[174:59.56]Alright.
[175:05.91]Shark.
[175:07.81]How do I get the shark to come up?
[175:13.36]Where's the shark?
[175:24.12]Where's the shark?
[175:26.52]Oh my goodness.
[175:37.01]What about these little things?
[175:39.73]What does it do?
[175:46.15]What is happening?
[175:49.29]Ethical?
[175:50.99]I'm so confused.
[175:51.65]It makes them your friend?
[175:52.70]Oh, I get it.
[175:55.02]Alright, who's my friend now?

[176:45.56]Okay, so let's go.
[176:47.35]What was I saying?
[176:47.87]Right, so don't swim.
[176:49.03]I remember Aqua Teen.
[176:49.85]I wasn't a big fan of Robot Chicken.
[176:51.19]Not really.
[177:03.95]Robot Chicken, to me, was just only Family Guy cutaways.
[177:07.13]There was nothing else.
[177:08.35]It was just the Family Guy cutaways.
[177:11.49]And I liked Family Guy.
[177:12.83]I liked Family Guy's actual stuff they did in the first six or seven seasons.
[177:17.80]But that whole show was just cutaway jokes.
[177:21.90]I mean, I just was like, eh, it's okay.
[177:22.90]You have to stop sometime!
[177:36.14]Yeah, the first five to ten seasons of Family Guy were... They had, yeah, they had character.
[177:41.38]I think they were fun.
[177:42.22]They were funny.
[177:42.70]Do you see Smiling Friends?
[177:47.67]It was fucking hilarious.
[177:50.71]Oh, yeah.
[177:51.73]So that's Adult Swim.
[177:54.25]But I feel like that's one of the only shows I've seen that actually light.
[178:02.41]Um, come on.
[178:04.99]It's bugged out.
[178:07.70]This needed another fucking two years in development.
[178:11.04]Yeah, but this should have been in development for two more years.
[178:15.16]Unbelievable.
[178:15.66]You know what I mean?
[178:16.62]Like... Good times.
[178:30.03]You know anywhere else they do business?
[178:32.03]Yeah, up to the north.
[178:39.06]Are the cops in the gang cars?
[178:41.58]Where do they come from?
[178:42.32]Alright, let's go.
[178:47.05]You don't look like you're having fun.
[178:48.03]Yeah, I am.
[178:50.87]I'm having fun.
[178:51.41]What are you talking about?
[178:53.49]This game's hilarious.
[178:55.89]The first hour of this game I did not like, I'll be honest.
[178:59.72]I felt like I wasn't even playing the game.
[179:01.94]Now I'm having... This is a great game.
[179:03.50]I'm having fun.
[179:06.54]I mean, I would have appreciated another year in development, though.
[179:18.56]He came up I killed that guy so bad he came up the driver's side Yeah, the first hour I was like yeah, but I gave it time and now I'm having a good time I think the game is really fun
[179:42.58]Oh god, is he dead?
[179:45.04]Oh shit.
[179:45.61]Is it gonna kill him?
[179:46.75]Whatever.
[179:47.03]I'll revive him.
[180:06.93]Come on, don't kill me with this shit.
[180:09.39]Dude, don't even do that.
[180:11.65]Get in the car.
[180:13.05]Get in the car.
[180:13.41]Get in the car.
[180:13.81]Get in the car.
[180:14.19]Get in the car.
[180:14.53]Don't kill me, please.
[180:15.41]I don't want to restart.
[180:16.51]Okay.
[180:16.61]What is he shooting at?
[180:17.41]Oh my god.
[180:45.73]I would love to lower my notoriety if my passenger wasn't firing out the window.
[180:50.56]And there's a jump right here, and it would be cool.
[181:14.36]Oh my, just get out.
[181:15.78]Just kill these fucking people following us.
[181:17.98]They won't leave us alone, so just get rid of them.
[181:20.72]Okay, let's go.
[181:28.76]Let's go, bike.
[181:32.10]They spawned in.
[181:33.09]They actually spawned in.
[181:39.33]What are you doing?
[181:39.71]Let's go!
[181:41.63]Get on the bike!
[181:42.43]Don't get in your own car!
[181:43.59]What are you, out of your mind?
[181:44.67]You idiot!
[181:46.75]Stop!
[181:47.39]Get on my- Whatever, I'm leaving you.
[182:05.62]I need to hide.
[182:06.36]You fucking asshole.
[182:17.10]Oh, so I was back in Massachusetts, right?
[182:23.40]Because obviously I did the wedding stuff.
[182:26.54]And I could tell I was back in Massachusetts.
[182:28.76]It had been a while.
[182:31.36]I was driving, and I just hear... I'm just sitting there, I'm at a red light, and I just hear out the window... You fucking douchebag!
[182:41.73]And somebody was just screaming at somebody.
[182:44.07]Like, out the window.
[182:46.13]I was like, oh, yep.
[182:48.97]Oh, I'm in Boston again.
[182:55.24]You passed it?
[182:55.94]Oh, shit.
[183:02.87]Where is he going?
[183:03.81]It's called not paying any attention to being on complete and total autopilot while I talk.
[183:13.77]What are you...
[183:18.77]Stop!
[183:20.41]Why don't you stop it?
[183:21.97]What is he doing?
[183:22.89]What are you doing?
[183:25.39]Um, why are you doing that?
[183:27.23]There's nobody here to shoot at.
[183:28.37]He's just shooting at random.
[183:29.39]Alright, I'm gonna dump this guy.
[183:43.26]Are we hiding?
[183:45.26]Does this count as hiding?
[184:02.40]Ah, two more.
[184:02.92]I guess it should have been two more years in development.
[184:09.80]Buy grenades.
[184:12.41]What?
[184:12.57]Can I buy a melee weapon?
[184:15.15]Doesn't look like it.
[184:28.70]You can?
[184:29.14]Oh, it's the taser slot.
[184:30.89]Oh, okay.
[184:31.21]It's not the actual punching slot.
[184:33.63]Cool.
[184:37.71]Oh.
[184:38.43]Sure.
[184:38.77]Okay.
[184:39.03]What would level... Okay.
[185:05.18]How do you switch weapons?
[185:06.94]How do I switch weapons?
[185:07.70]How does it work?
[185:12.60]Um... Okay.
[185:13.06]Okay.
[185:40.59]Let's get this one.
[185:41.91]Alright, so what now?
[185:44.37]Tank Mayhem.
[185:49.25]Holy shit, are you okay?
[186:06.96]You need to go get the scout outfit now?
[186:08.86]Yeah, I do.
[186:13.33]We needed a break from the Team Fortress 2 joke, right?
[186:17.11]We can bring it back.
[186:31.10]Can you, like, kick?
[186:34.10]No.
[186:41.98]TF2 is not a joke.
[186:43.08]I said the TF2 joke, not that the game is a joke.
[186:46.10]Were you listening?
[186:48.20]Come on.
[186:50.46]Do $125,000 in property damage.
[186:52.29]Sure.
[186:54.05]High value targets.
[187:03.35]Oh, this was in Saints Row 2.
[187:05.41]Yep.
[187:06.47]This is loud, by the way.
[187:07.69]I realize how loud this just was.
[187:28.68]Wasn't the trick from Saints Row 2 to shoot fences?
[187:33.96]The fences were worth an insane amount, right?
[187:35.62]No, 31, 30, okay, 40 combo.
[187:56.91]Alright, I get it.
[188:06.03]Defenses are still the meta.
[188:07.25]OK, good to know.
[188:09.19]Good to know.
[188:19.38]OK, cool.
[188:25.10]I didn't want to do that.
[188:31.33]Professor Genki You ready to be a star?
[188:36.79]Thought we already were.
[188:37.61]Oh, not like this.
[188:39.01]What's the running melee?
[188:39.87]You've been personally selected for a spot on a game show here in town.
[188:43.01]Game show?
[188:44.59]You're not trying to auction me off on some dating thing, are you?
[188:47.53]Trust me, you'll love this shit.
[188:49.45]Meet me and I'll show you.
[188:50.85]You better be right.
[188:51.97]Ooh, nice car.
[188:54.55]Nice car.
[189:11.96]He has no emotion when he's killing people I'm Nice car immediately crashes it this is Saints Row Okay, this is Saints Row
[189:35.90]Don't shoot panda.
[190:01.00]Shoot first aid?
[190:01.58]It's murder time!
[190:02.62]Spun time!
[190:29.37]Earn money by destroying targets, killing enemies, and exiting the arena before time runs out.
[190:32.41]If you destroy things in quick succession, you'll earn a bonus.
[190:34.67]Let's go.
[190:36.87]I'm already on fire.
[190:44.06]You got it, Zack.
[190:45.12]If our contestants can survive the deadly traps, armed mascots, and those freakishly huge hunters, they can win a hefty pile of cash.
[190:53.65]This game looks deadly, because it is.
[190:56.78]But it's still probably safer than driving in Steelport.
[191:00.76]Our competitor isn't from steelport this time.
[191:03.36]Get the fucking electricity watching the leader of the saints the world famous Stillwater street gang as many times as this former gangbanger has been shot at blown up run over and generally put through hell This competition probably seems pretty routine.
[191:19.75]Uh routine maybe but lucrative You are going to make professor yankee sized driving hose around that's for sure touching
[191:32.44]Destruction.
[191:32.84]I didn't... What?
[191:33.30]Destruction.
[191:33.76]Destruction.
[192:01.43]This is really amazing shooting.
[192:04.31]Carnage.
[192:13.15]Quite a performance so far.
[192:20.22]Like sticking a fork in a socket.
[192:23.26]How can anyone recover from that?
[192:30.32]I hope the money is worth this.
[192:32.36]So Bobby, how do you clean sewage out of a convertible?
[192:35.28]With a toothbrush.
[192:36.34]Really?
[192:36.78]No, I let the rental company take care of it.
[192:39.88]Are you kidding me?
[192:40.60]What's that kind of shitty of you?
[192:42.45]Not as shitty as what this contestant is doing to those mascots.
[192:46.63]Mayhem.
[192:47.19]How do you shake that one off?
[192:49.57]I'm trying to jump over it.
[192:52.79]I can't jump over this?
[192:53.91]Valuable seconds.
[192:57.08]That'll cinch the hair.
[193:01.40]He's not dead!
[193:14.03]I didn't get points for that.
[193:16.63]I didn't get points yet.
[193:17.37]I'm still getting a hit marker.
[193:19.75]What's going on?
[193:22.85]Chaos.
[193:23.09]Carnage.
[193:47.07]I'm making a lot of money now.
[194:00.58]Cool.
[194:03.30]We've only just begun.
[194:04.34]How many times did you get electrocuted?
[194:09.66]I don't know.
[194:17.08]Is that a cement mixer?
[194:23.21]What the fuck?
[194:27.33]Oh my god, what is this?
[194:33.95]He has the face, he's wearing the head.
[194:37.19]He's driving a car with it.
[194:42.83]What?
[194:50.30]Holy shit.
[194:52.62]Okay.
[194:59.45]Fucking douchebag.
[195:31.30]What is this?
[195:32.75]Oh my goodness.
[195:34.89]Okay.
[195:42.43]Give me a fucking goddamn controller.
[195:47.42]That's the fucking mouse.
[195:50.74]Whatever.
[195:53.25]Controller aim is just like okay.
[195:55.95]I'm putting my head underwater and then playing You really don't want to ride with me Let's go I'm surprised the syndicate is still standing after all this shit.
[196:15.50]We've thrown at him Not saying we should are you a cousin from Boston I?
[196:22.98]It's a fucking Lager.
[196:23.78]You don't know what a Lager is, dude?
[196:25.86]I'm your cousin.
[196:28.36]I wasn't looking.
[196:39.17]It's always so funny that Boston people in commercials, TV shows, and whatever, they're always a cartoon character.
[196:48.80]Like, don't you just imagine that all the people that are, like, all the Boston people that are in all these commercials and TV shows are gonna bring out a big cartoon mallet?
[196:56.03]What's to hate?
[196:57.25]Beer is cheap, and I'm the best looking motherfucker in here.
[197:01.08]Look, you may think it's time to kick back, but I'm done toying with these bastards.
[197:04.48]I want Loren, and I want him now.
[197:06.06]So where is he?
[197:08.53]I'm a cartoon character?
[197:10.37]No, I'm not.
[197:10.85]Wait, I can do that?
[197:11.65]What?
[197:11.81]I don't know that.
[197:13.19]What?
[197:13.51]Hey.
[197:38.14]I don't know if I could go all the way back like this.
[197:40.94]How far can I go?
[197:41.66]Let's see.
[197:47.10]Holy shit.
[197:47.40]Can I just be like this for the rest of the day?
[197:52.77]My ult chair didn't do that.
[197:57.07]That ult chair sucked, by the way.
[197:58.51]Can I be honest?
[197:58.99]Nice.
[198:00.99]Okay.
[198:10.98]That chair sucked.
[198:17.90]That chair made you.
[198:21.12]Is it better?
[198:23.33]Yeah, I don't want to say too much about like, oh yeah, wow, everything's amazing.
[198:28.01]But I definitely feel... It definitely feels a little more comfortable.
[198:32.33]I told you, there's a crank on the back of the chair that I can like crank, crank, crank, crank, crank and get it... Oh my god!
[198:43.02]What the... Get on the bike!
[198:44.36]Okay, let's go.
[198:54.79]Yeah, so... Something I didn't know... When you get... Yeah, it's the... It's the gaming chair with the... It starts with an E.
[199:14.92]It's whatever the Herman Miller gaming one is.
[199:16.56]I forget what it's... E?
[199:20.16]No, not the EZ Gamer.
[199:23.95]The Embody?
[199:25.45]Yeah.
[199:26.89]It's the blue one.
[199:27.85]The blue and the black one.
[199:28.55]Because all the other gaming chairs, I don't... I don't like the fucking... I hate those things.
[199:42.54]What about the inside, motherfucker?
[199:49.04]The chair that I had before... Yeah, this is way, way more expensive.
[200:03.91]I had... The chair that I had before, I think, was... 500 or 600?
[200:07.99]And it was like, oh, back support, lumbar, and cushion, and...
[200:15.83]This to me feels more like a like a chair.
[200:19.77]Like a chair, like a real chair.
[200:23.13]I think the problem that I had a lot of times sitting in a chair for like in a whatever office chair, whatever.
[200:28.73]Is it was so cushioning?
[200:31.17]That if I felt like I wasn't sitting in a chair, this to me is this to me is a chair.
[200:36.92]A real chair.
[200:39.46]Did I just drive in a circle?
[200:40.42]I'm sorry.
[200:42.00]What are we going?
[200:43.70]I forget what happened.
[200:50.56]Alright, we're good.
[200:55.20]But, I mean, I think... I'm trying to think of how much these retail for.
[200:58.20]A lot.
[200:58.58]Let's head to the office and see if they're hiding under their desk.
[201:11.00]Let me put it this way.
[201:11.74]My back feels like it's propped up.
[201:15.82]Because before I kind of could just sink in and slouch a little.
[201:18.44]But this is like I'm in the chair.
[201:20.26]I'm sitting in a chair.
[201:25.72]Seriously.
[201:26.84]You both are shooting me with sniper rifles from like 15 feet away.
[201:29.26]You fucking assholes.
[201:30.28]I couldn't even reload.
[201:39.49]You know what else I like about this thing?
[201:42.39]Maybe I'll show you.
[201:44.05]You can pull the seat forward.
[201:47.41]Alright, so here's your ass, right?
[201:50.04]Well, this is like your ass sitting in the chair.
[201:52.06]I'll just show you.
[201:53.80]No, I mean, I have like pajamas on.
[201:55.10]I'll show you like tomorrow, the next day.
[202:00.24]the bottom of the chair if you've got a big fat ass you could this the ass part of the chair can be extended which is a huge deal to me an absolutely massive deal so this has a setting that you can adjust for a huge ass whoever's in charge here probably knows where to find loren let's head to the office and see if they're hiding the butt of this seat is like collapsible it comes in and out you like can pull the bottom out so it's wide like longer and wider almost
[202:32.00]And I feel like my big fat ass is sitting in this comfortably.
[202:36.10]Okay, I gotta go upstairs.
[202:49.44]Find a way upstairs.
[202:50.16]Let's go.
[202:51.66]What the fuck?
[202:53.10]Nice one, boss.
[203:05.63]I can't get up there?
[203:06.11]Here we go.
[203:11.79]You're never going to get a job after you stream.
[203:13.95]Because I have a huge ass?
[203:18.73]Oh, Mr. Elbertson, we're really happy.
[203:20.65]We really think you're very qualified for this job here at Stevenson and Stevenson Associates.
[203:25.79]But I'm sorry, your ass is too big.
[203:27.17]We're not going to be able to fit you any chairs.
[203:29.41]No chairs in this office will be able to do it.
[203:31.09]I'm sorry, but your ass is too big.
[203:34.48]What?
[203:40.65]Why are you standing in front of a Gatling gun?
[203:48.81]I got this.
[203:52.84]Why, why, why, why, why, why, why?
[203:53.84]Am I gonna put a grenade in his mouth?
[203:59.40]That's gonna hurt us.
[204:00.66]Oh boy, yup.
[204:21.61]Alright, come on, let's go, go, go, go, go.
[204:26.56]The armrest can move.
[204:28.66]Like, wider or... I like it.
[204:32.08]Let's see after, like, a week, though.
[204:33.52]Because that's a real test here.
[204:36.16]I know a lot of you guys know that I have pretty bad, like, back and spine, like, chest pain shit.
[204:44.05]I'll give you my real assessment in, like, a week.
[204:50.62]Because I feel like it's going to take a while for me to figure that out.
[204:55.01]And I'm not going to bullshit you.
[204:56.39]I am not going to give you horse shit.
[204:58.97]Trust me, you know.
[205:00.37]You know, yeah, come on.
[205:01.71]You think I'm going to feed you horse shit?
[205:02.77]No, I'm going to tell you what I think.
[205:05.59]Give it a week or two.
[205:07.27]What's wrong with your nose?
[205:09.15]Um, I don't know.
[205:11.47]It's crooked.
[205:12.53]Deal with it.
[205:18.29]It's the, uh, it's the, it's the gaming hermit militia.
[205:22.85]The M-body.
[205:25.67]I'm playing randomizer in TF2.
[205:42.36]Fuck, that game is so fun.
[205:45.62]God damn it.
[205:46.34]I miss that game.
[205:56.09]God damn it.
[205:56.71]You know what I mean?
[206:08.36]Damn.
[206:08.74]Yeah, I was going to say, is it playable?
[206:12.19]Or if you open TF2, would you like 50 bots snipe you in the head?
[206:16.97]Like in the menu?
[206:31.67]Okay, we're going way too slow.
[206:33.31]Put this down.
[206:39.11]Alright, let's go.
[206:43.78]Put it down.
[206:44.10]I don't need this anymore.
[206:46.66]Looks like they don't want us getting into that office.
[206:48.82]We're not giving them a choice.
[206:55.22]Guess the manager cleared out.
[206:56.84]I'll get what I can off the computer.
[207:05.02]I made it!
[207:07.73]Smash the computers!
[207:19.21]Oh shit!
[207:20.09]I need the minigun!
[207:21.22]Can I get the minigun back?
[207:29.84]Why do I have such a big head?
[207:30.74]I actually have a small head.
[207:32.52]My head's not big.
[207:33.18]It's pretty small.
[207:34.84]Check this out.
[207:35.28]Look at my hands.
[207:35.90]My hands are, like, way bigger than my head.
[207:37.26]I don't think... My head's not small.
[207:47.12]It's just... peculiar.
[208:01.93]Pierce, we've waited long enough.
[208:03.45]Now we go for Loren.
[208:04.73]It won't be easy.
[208:05.95]That whole tower's gotta be crawling with Morningstar.
[208:08.19]Since when have we done things the easy way?
[208:09.59]It's peculiar.
[208:09.99]True.
[208:10.95]So what's the plan?
[208:12.11]Kill everyone we see and find Loren?
[208:13.75]Makes sense.
[208:14.51]Meet me at the penthouse.
[208:15.33]I'll call Shondy.
[208:17.78]Shondy, it's time.
[208:18.84]Just tell me where to be.
[208:19.82]We're meeting at the penthouse.
[208:21.06]I am gonna kill that son of a bitch.
[208:22.74]Don't worry.
[208:23.78]You won't get away this time.
[208:35.86]In the game.
[208:36.48]Whatever.
[208:37.80]But it's still in real life too.
[208:44.36]That person came out of the windshield.
[208:46.28]I want that car.
[208:52.15]That is a nice car.
[209:00.19]Do you guys remember all the GTA 4 videos where I... One of the funny things that I thought was the funniest thing in those videos, what I really tried to capture...
[209:10.92]Alright, bye.
[209:12.58]Uh, I always wanted to drive really fast, and I would always be- whether it was, uh, like, Ster or, like, Boo MLC Stealth, it was always like, oh, you know, you drive the opposite way as fast as you can, and I drive the other way as fast as I can.
[209:25.33]And we're gonna line it up perfectly, so when I dive out of the car, it's the perfect angle and the perfect amount of force where I'm gonna fly out, and I'm going to hit my fucking head directly into the front of your car.
[209:54.14]But yeah, but that was me though.
[209:56.81]I did that, apparently.
[209:57.73]That was me.
[210:00.01]Get fucking DDT'd.
[210:04.10]What did I do?
[210:22.49]But yeah, I would always try to jump out so I could hit my fucking head directly into their car.
[210:27.26]And I finally got it once.
[210:30.58]It's actually really hard to get it.
[210:33.88]You'd be surprised at how difficult that actually is to do.
[210:44.19]There's a lot of new viewers here.
[210:47.31]What's up?
[210:47.67]How are you?
[210:48.01]Let's give that motherfucker what's coming to him.
[210:58.28]This is so dumb.
[211:04.91]The MVM trailer.
[211:12.22]Oh one guy.
[211:12.72]Oh one guy?
[211:34.27]How hard do you think finding Philippe will be?
[211:36.11]Come on, he's a criminal mastermind.
[211:37.93]He's got to be on the top floor.
[211:39.83]It's like... Top floor, sin tower.
[211:42.87]Doesn't matter.
[211:43.87]We're killing everyone in there.
[211:49.00]I just looked over here as if I was looking at the passenger side.
[211:52.26]I was going to be, what the fuck?
[211:54.06]They'll drive it in.
[212:00.12]How many times you gonna check that gun?
[212:01.76]How long is it gonna take us to get there?
[212:03.30]I was just asking.
[212:04.36]Save it for Lorenz Goons.
[212:06.62]Get the fuck out of here!
[212:15.09]That was like I did that on purpose.
[212:16.67]Get the fuck out of here.
[212:20.73]That guy was my target.
[212:27.99]So fucking stupid.
[212:30.46]They ain't fucking around here.
[212:31.66]Oh, fucking douchebag.
[212:33.92]Shit, they have snipers in here.
[212:36.58]You think all packages are this hard to drop off in?
[212:39.19]Ha ha.
[212:39.85]Can you just shoot them?
[213:01.91]Good.
[213:03.21]Good shot.
[213:04.17]Nice work.
[213:06.33]Except not really.
[213:18.62]Bad guy.
[213:22.66]Oh, shit.
[213:23.20]It's a heavy.
[213:25.66]Oh, look out.
[213:26.24]Look out.
[213:26.56]Look out.
[213:26.84]Here comes the heavy.
[213:33.46]What if I put him on my team?
[213:43.64]No?
[213:44.74]What about a shark?
[213:47.68]Get him.
[213:48.72]Shark.
[213:50.62]Grab him.
[213:52.93]Shark.
[213:53.75]Get him.
[213:54.61]Nice Dark Souls dodge.
[213:57.03]I played those games.
[213:57.67]I've been trained for this moment.
[214:18.36]Get over here I need the needle gun
[214:41.02]The needle gun was always so satisfying.
[214:43.46]Guys, I was terrible with the needle gun.
[214:46.22]Truly awful.
[214:47.84]But sometimes, every once in a while, you would go like this.
[214:52.49]You'd be running down a hallway.
[214:53.89]Stop.
[214:54.63]What is going on?
[214:55.21]Who's shooting that?
[214:56.33]Stop firing your gun.
[214:59.89]Shut up.
[215:01.93]Shut the fuck up.
[215:07.61]So every so often, you would fire the... You'd be going down a hallway, somebody would be coming this way, and you would get it completely perfectly.
[215:13.86]Where you'd go... You'd go like... And you'd watch it take two or three seconds to... And you'd kill... Dad, you'd kill him.
[215:24.84]What a fucking fun game.
[215:26.43]I have 15 minutes to do... Alright, we gotta go.
[215:40.05]I'm not angry.
[215:42.03]Every time I have a facial hair, people think I'm mad every day.
[215:44.89]What did you do?
[215:46.72]It wasn't me.
[215:47.82]It just stopped.
[215:48.68]Did you really expect to slide down to my office when I controlled it?
[215:54.48]Shit.
[215:55.54]Nothing slows me down.
[216:05.09]Okay, that was impressive.
[216:27.10]I remember Rage quitting a server because there was one spy on the other team that was unkillable and killed every single fucking person.
[216:35.64]And no one could play the game.
[216:37.50]Remember that?
[216:42.20]And you'd see the top frag list, and it would be, this person is spy.
[216:46.82]80 points.
[216:47.70]And then the next person under there was an engineer with like 6.
[216:49.74]Alright, up, up, up, up, up.
[217:02.44]Dude, just hop on TF2.
[217:03.66]I'm already waiting.
[217:04.98]Maybe one day.
[217:05.70]Oh my god, he's running over here.
[217:07.32]We're just letting this guy run over here?
[217:08.94]We're just letting this guy run down here.
[217:32.93]pyro shoot that tank that is like the medic
[218:17.82]Oh my god!
[218:23.28]Fucking help me, you idiot!
[218:26.26]Oh my god, how long does it take to reload?
[218:30.45]Fire, fire, fire!
[218:38.77]Alright, he's fucking dead.
[218:42.82]Where's my- where's my revive?
[218:47.10]Fuck, come here, come here, come here, come here.
[218:55.13]Everyone, I am on fire.
[218:57.51]Oh my god, let's play, let's go, let's play it.
[219:01.44]At some point, in the next, like, six months.
[219:16.31]Alright, let's go.
[219:17.21]Okay.
[219:44.57]Torch him.
[219:45.25]What the hell is all this?
[220:07.45]The Kriskrig.
[220:08.41]Fuck, the Kriskrig is fucking cool.
[220:14.12]Philip likes his things custom-made.
[220:17.22]And for his brutes, I am the master pattern, you see.
[220:21.28]Why are you still strung up if they already cloned your ass?
[220:24.16]The copies are flawed.
[220:25.82]They have my brawn, but not my brain.
[220:29.46]I can help you.
[220:31.53]The last time a big naked dude said he could help me, it did not end well.
[220:35.21]What could he do anyway?
[220:36.19]Those wires and shit are probably keeping him alive.
[220:38.59]Trust me.
[220:39.85]I'm still strong enough to kill Philip.
[220:57.91]You want some clothes, man?
[220:59.91]No time.
[221:00.80]I gotta pee.
[221:04.16]Man, like I said, last time a big naked dude.
[221:10.18]This elevator will take us to the offices.
[221:16.99]Alright, elevator.
[221:22.63]Jeremy, you didn't laugh at the penis.
[221:25.41]Follow me to Philip's office.
[221:26.95]Seriously, man, you know, if you want, I can find you like a curtain or something for you.
[221:30.68]We left him in the elevator.
[221:31.72]He is nothing to be ashamed of unless you have insecurities.
[221:36.90]Did he leave us?
[221:37.70]How do we get out of here?
[221:38.86]My name is Oli Kirloff.
[221:40.60]So what did you do before you were a glorified pincushion?
[221:45.64]I think it's best for our friendship I never elaborate.
[221:49.04]Just know that the enemy of your enemy is your friend.
[221:52.33]He can't fit down the stairs.
[221:53.75]You have nothing to fear from me.
[221:55.33]Works for me.
[221:56.81]Welcome to the Saints.
[222:04.56]We're supposed to be following this guy.
[222:08.94]Where do we go?
[222:09.84]We're following you, man.
[222:23.00]Hey!
[222:29.34]What the fuck?
[222:30.88]Dude!
[222:33.63]Fuck off!
[222:42.92]Alright, let's go.
[222:44.32]So, follow Oleg.
[222:51.98]Dude hurry up You got spy check There's no way to catch fuck that oh
[223:23.95]Oh, that scared the shit out of me.
[223:26.69]I don't know why.
[223:54.99]Wait, why am I fighting him?
[224:05.33]Oh, it's a clone, right?
[224:17.44]This guy's been smoking the same cigarette for four hours.
[224:25.54]Did I get him?
[224:28.18]Blow up the building.
[224:33.18]Oh no.
[224:33.38]Is he dead?
[224:34.02]Disarm the bomb.
[224:35.17]Disarm the bomb.
[224:36.69]I want to keep this.
[224:55.97]I get to keep it, right?
[224:57.75]Cool.
[225:11.71]We're going to have to do something about the pink.
[225:14.98]You'd prefer a more manly shade like purple?
[225:18.42]It's not purple.
[225:32.84]This makes me want to just get up and fucking dance.
[225:54.88]When I left Stillwater for the Senate, I vowed never to forget my hometown roots.
[226:01.01]My husband gave his life defending Stillwater from gang violence.
[226:05.31]It is my greatest privilege to honor him with this bridge.
[226:08.91]I thought that was a chainsaw.
[226:13.25]What the...
[226:36.35]They're just people we're going to have to lean out of the car window and shoot fucking grenades at them.
[226:42.43]About maybe 50 to 60 cars are going to show up.
[226:44.44]We're going to be leaning out the window, firing at them.
[226:48.20]You new to the Saints?
[226:49.54]Time for the high spot, boys.
[227:33.98]You know, why don't we all just split the money?
[227:37.26]The amount of money that we all have to spend as different gangs on new cars and new ammo and new personnel.
[227:45.99]We would have been in profit if we just split all the money equally exactly.
[227:52.91]I want to see the balance sheet.
[227:59.61]The, like, six to seven million dollars in cars that you have to spend because people keep blowing them up versus what it would take if we just split all the assets together.
[228:09.84]Like, we'd probably be in the green by a lot.
[228:12.22]I mean, let's just go to the fucking movies.
[228:15.06]Let's just go to the movies and hang out.
[228:17.94]What's going on here?
[228:31.21]Let's just go to the movies.
[228:35.39]I wonder what would happen if I would just walk up to one of the leaders or something and be like, hey, dude.
[228:39.21]You want to go to the movies?
[228:40.81]You know, why not?
[228:41.75]You want to go?
[228:42.41]And pick something fucking stupid, you know what I mean?
[228:43.99]Pick, like, Space Jam.
[228:54.70]Who's gonna say no to Space Jam, right?
[228:56.57]Just pick something like Space Jam.
[229:01.67]All of you would leave that movie and you wouldn't even care anymore.
[229:07.85]You'd be laughing about Space Jam.
[229:10.85]You'd be like, yeah, that movie was fucking terrible.
[229:14.09]Space Jam 2, fucking awful movie.
[229:17.19]Yeah, what a bad movie, right?
[229:19.91]And we can agree.
[229:26.99]I don't even know if Space Jam is a good movie.
[229:28.52]I didn't see it.
[229:32.68]Let's just all go see Morbius.
[229:35.16]And guess what?
[229:35.76]The other leader of the other gang is going to be sitting there going like... Like looking at you like... Let's fucking look at me.
[229:43.31]They're going to go back to look at the screen and eventually... They're going to crack.
[229:48.71]Because the Morbin time scene is going to happen.
[229:51.01]And you're going to look over and he's going to be like...
[229:59.11]Okay.
[229:59.77]Alright is funny.
[230:01.11]Alright is funny.
[230:03.37]And then we can just be like, alright.
[230:04.83]See?
[230:07.11]And let's just go to fucking McDonald's on the way back.
[230:09.69]All of us.
[230:10.17]Just get like six or seven of all the leaders in the car.
[230:12.67]Let's just go to McDonald's, man.
[230:13.97]Let's split a hundred nuggets.
[230:17.06]No.
[230:17.92]I don't know.
[230:18.36]Let's just all split a hundred nuggets.
[230:19.54]Whatever.
[230:34.11]I guarantee I'd get a text.
[230:37.16]A day later.
[230:46.28]Oh my god, I wasn't watching!
[230:49.64]Alright, we made it.
[230:56.22]Got him.
[230:56.59]Eye on tie.
[231:17.62]So what do you want with me?
[231:19.29]You don't look like feds.
[231:20.21]We heard that you know some people who hate syndicate as much as we do.
[231:23.69]You like nuggets?
[231:25.46]Do you like nuggets?
[231:27.67]And by the way... If one of the ten gang leaders or whatever of the various... You don't want to go to McDonald's?
[231:31.78]Um, no, McDonald's sucks.
[231:32.46]Oh, their nuggets are the worst.
[231:34.08]Can we go to Burger King?
[232:00.74]The war restarts.
[232:15.08]You ever been to one of these clubs?
[232:16.56]I look like I go to one of those clubs.
[232:18.56]I'm just saying, you know, powerful guy, stressful job.
[232:21.54]Stop.
[232:22.34]That's what I thought.
[232:22.92]I'm very sorry.
[232:23.70]I don't like McDonald's nuggets.
[232:28.86]It tastes like wheat that a man pulled out of his ass and then put in fryer.
[232:36.84]I'd tear the fucking contract in half.
[232:44.25]That wasn't much of a challenge.
[232:51.16]That's how I like them.
[232:52.68]What are you putting in your ass?
[232:53.96]I said it just tastes like weed.
[232:55.08]I don't know.
[232:55.86]It's somebody's ass.
[232:56.72]I don't know.
[232:58.82]Have I told you about the Herman Miller chair?
[233:00.12]It's very company.
[233:01.30]What's... Oh.
[233:20.82]Is this actually TOS?
[233:21.50]I'll find out.
[233:29.03]I really do like that I can kind of... There's a wedge that I cranked into my back.
[233:35.34]It's very nice.
[233:48.24]Tell me what Zemo says or I'm going to beat you stupid.
[233:52.23]Oh, yes!
[233:53.91]Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
[233:55.51]The manager's upstairs.
[233:59.21]I've been bad.
[233:59.99]Don't mess with the saints.
[234:15.17]Grab the pa- Get out of the fucking way, you annoying door!
[234:27.78]Grab the pa- He says I can't grab him.
[234:34.82]I didn't- I'm trying to grab this guy!
[234:38.30]Grab the fu- He's on the- Oh, it's upstairs.
[234:40.78]Oops-a-daisy.
[234:43.62]I'm trying to grab the guy.
[234:46.06]Grab the patrons.
[234:47.06]I thought it was upstairs.
[234:48.78]That's my bad.
[234:50.06]That's my bad.
[234:50.66]I was trying to grab... You get it.
[235:00.51]I didn't grab the guy.
[235:01.13]Oh, maybe I did.
[235:01.45]Yeah, this didn't happen to the last guy.
[235:14.71]How do I let go of people without killing them?
[235:16.88]Alright, he's alive.
[235:19.44]Find the owner.
[235:20.04]Do you remember to look at the bed?
[235:25.74]Hey, hey!
[235:33.17]What?
[235:35.35]I'm... I don't want...
[235:42.58]I didn't kill her.
[235:44.10]No, no, no, no, no!
[235:44.92]Stop firing, stop firing, stop firing.
[235:46.54]Seriously, dude, don't.
[235:53.06]Drop it.
[235:53.36]Get out of the fucking way.
[236:05.10]Get out of the...
[236:10.26]We cool?
[236:11.42]Are we cool?
[236:12.76]Alright, we're cool.
[236:15.35]Come here.
[236:18.45]Who wins?
[236:32.16]We need to see who... I gotta see how this plays out.
[236:34.84]Come on, man.
[236:37.01]Excuse me?
[236:38.71]I've been watching something.
[236:43.95]Oh, hello.
[236:52.04]Sorry.
[236:52.46]Didn't see you all there.
[236:56.36]TOS?
[236:56.98]Where?
[237:01.82]Where's TOS?
[237:02.40]Where?
[237:04.90]I think we're okay.
[237:11.22]I think we're okay.
[237:13.79]On the screen in that room.
[237:15.17]Well, I'm not looking at it.
[237:16.71]Why would you let me really... Remind me?
[237:28.33]Have you ever been banned?
[237:29.11]No?
[237:29.23]I have not.
[237:30.31]What the hell was that?
[237:57.44]What are you doing?
[238:06.72]Why do they explode?
[238:08.34]Why are they exploding?
[238:25.36]Sorry about making you, you know, pull us around.
[238:29.28]This is a rescue, right?
[238:31.88]This ain't some elaborate setup for a gang bang.
[238:34.94]Why you got to put that image in my head, bro?
[238:37.48]Oh, I'll go and rescue them.
[238:40.23]I want to shake your hands, but them floors are a little sticky, if you know what I'm saying.
[238:47.17]I'm good.
[238:47.83]What in the name of God am I playing?
[238:48.91]This is Saints Row 3rd.
[238:50.71]What's up?
[238:51.03]I found the guy I was talking about.
[238:57.21]Okay.
[238:57.51]I got 20 grand.
[238:58.13]Are these all bad?
[238:58.79]What were they all doing out here?
[239:00.65]Oh shit.
[239:00.97]Find Angel.
[239:03.65]I can't read.
[239:27.61]8,000 feet.
[239:28.01]You should auto-tune everybody.
[239:29.49]What can I buy with 20 grand?
[239:32.09]Is it bugs in my hair?
[239:59.93]He looks funny today, why?
[240:01.03]I look funny today?
[240:12.73]Maybe, is the camera in a weird position?
[240:14.02]Because I'm forward today.
[240:15.60]I'm like kind of pushed forward.
[240:17.66]Do I look like I'm pushed forward?
[240:27.02]Maybe a little.
[240:40.37]You look normal.
[240:41.03]Okay.
[240:41.89]Because I know I'm pushed up a little from the new chair.
[240:49.60]I might want to crank the thing up a little higher.
[240:51.10]Because it's supposed to sit in the kind of curve of your back.
[241:01.76]You can hear the crickets instead of the car.
[241:17.57]It's an electric vehicle.
[241:19.04]It kind of sounds like that.
[241:23.94]I can't believe we heard John from Delocated earlier.
[241:26.80]That was so weird.
[241:27.58]This is John from Delocated.
[241:31.09]It's called Rage Cage.
[241:33.49]You know what's funny?
[241:34.23]Okay, Delocated did this bit where John had this thing called the Rage Cage.
[241:40.54]And it was a joke that you could come in and just smash a bunch of shit.
[241:44.54]And it was really funny.
[241:45.24]Like, oh yeah, there's like business where you go in and smash a bunch of shit.
[241:48.12]You pay and break a bunch of computers and stuff.
[241:50.71]And that turned into a bunch of real popular businesses.
[241:53.99]15 plus years later, 10 plus years later.
[241:57.23]On all these roads.
[242:05.56]Alright, let's get it.
[242:07.10]What if I crash into somebody that's big like that?
[242:13.34]Delocated.
[242:13.84]Yeah, Delocated was a really funny show.
[242:15.98]Oh, this is John.
[242:16.60]He does it.
[242:20.48]No, hey, hey.
[242:21.71]John, he does it.
[242:25.69]No, come on.
[242:26.67]Like, if you know what I'm talking about, that's based.
[242:30.45]You know what I mean?
[242:31.71]That's what I would say.
[242:49.07]Alright, give me something bigger than this.
[242:50.85]Like the f***ing shark gun.
[242:55.90]Fight him.
[242:57.08]Fight him.
[242:59.30]Why are you going after the cop?
[243:01.72]Oh, that's why.
[243:02.42]Why is that so loud?
[243:16.47]You know what?
[243:16.85]Let's f***ing just... Here we go.
[243:18.25]Watch this s***.
[243:22.33]Why am I spitting?
[243:30.33]What are you doing?
[243:31.65]What?
[243:34.61]I'm so confused.
[243:35.59]Why was I doing that?
[243:45.60]Goodbye.
[243:48.08]I've been slaying on your good side.
[243:51.97]This guy was walking away normally like nothing was wrong
[244:07.55]I'm not too late to the party, am I?
[244:09.67]Wait, we have a new friend?
[244:11.01]There's plenty of people left to kill.
[244:13.01]Let's head inside and find Angel.
[244:14.33]Okay.
[244:15.07]Can we all get in the car, or... Are we just gonna... Can he get in the car?
[244:20.41]I don't think he can get in the car.
[244:22.33]He's a little too big.
[244:44.75]There you are.
[244:45.95]Can you just pick me up and throw me into the window?
[244:50.65]You know that would be in the movie.
[244:52.07]How we supposed to get in there?
[244:53.47]It's the top floor.
[244:54.11]Well, I think I know a way to get to the building.
[245:12.49]Huh?
[245:13.57]What do you mean?
[245:14.23]And then it cuts to inside the top floor and glass break of me getting into the building, flying through.
[245:21.00]And then it cuts outside and he goes like, he's going like this.
[245:27.22]I'm a writer.
[245:42.93]That would be pretty funny.
[245:43.55]Yeah, I know.
[245:45.41]Just give me a pen and a paper.
[245:47.73]Just give me a pen and a paper.
[245:48.78]I got you.
[245:50.64]I can do that, by the way.
[245:54.18]If you don't believe me, watch Jerma Rumble live action.
[245:58.36]Pac-Man, I was Pac-Man, and I did that to somebody.
[246:00.71]So, fuck off if you think I'm a liar.
[246:02.93]That's right.
[246:11.82]Leave this imposter to me.
[246:13.92]Well, go get him then.
[246:28.13]Father, you are no child of mine.
[246:32.58]Just an abomination.
[246:37.28]Here, let me help.
[246:40.34]Let me help, I help.
[246:42.16]Nice piledriver, good.
[246:49.81]Alright, we got him.
[246:56.53]Minigun up top!
[247:04.36]I'll take care of this.
[247:09.12]Uh, okay.
[247:10.41]Hide?
[247:20.47]Stop shooting one bullet and reloading the gun, man.
[247:24.43]Oh my fucking god, I'm so dead.
[247:39.66]Oh my god.
[247:40.66]I'm dead.
[247:46.88]Nice toupee.
[247:49.08]Didn't I say that I banned that shit?
[247:50.83]Like when people talk about the toupee.
[247:53.25]It's a banned term.
[247:54.33]Read the fucking rules.
[247:55.27]Read the rules before you chat in the stream.
[248:13.29]You are no child of mine, just an abomination.
[248:17.84]Did he say happy birthday to my brother Ben?
[248:19.42]Happy birthday, Ben!
[248:21.26]It's me, Jerma985.
[248:22.22]I hope you get what you're looking for for your birthday, surrounded by friends and family.
[248:30.95]You fight with the strength of Achilles!
[248:35.99]What the fuck is that guy carrying?
[248:38.47]Let me go up top!
[248:43.39]Wow, you're fucking bad at shooting that gun.
[248:46.16]I'll take care of this.
[248:47.56]Dork.
[248:59.67]Your skill's improving.
[249:05.61]This guy... I need to kill this guy.
[249:13.75]Where is he, up top?
[249:16.57]Where is this guy?
[249:17.25]Oops, sorry.
[249:22.99]Where is this other guy?
[249:25.47]I don't... Where is he?
[249:27.67]Oh, please.
[249:30.96]Of course.
[249:42.22]Where is he?
[249:46.73]Alright, let's kill this guy, please.
[249:48.17]Together.
[249:49.61]One and a two and a three.
[250:03.04]A little busy here.
[250:04.82]I'm getting to it.
[250:11.80]Be careful.
[250:12.26]They have flamethrowers.
[250:25.27]Fuck.
[250:27.11]I thought someone was gonna be up here.
[250:28.51]Somebody is up here.
[250:30.42]Oh, hold on.
[250:37.30]See, somebody's upstairs.
[250:38.50]Who is it?
[250:48.58]He's gonna explode.
[250:53.84]That's what I'm talking about.
[250:58.12]Termite, you're bad.
[250:59.22]I'm fine.
[251:01.02]I'm fine.
[251:04.22]Well, ladies and gentlemen, Philippe is dead, and we are at a crossroads.
[251:14.28]And the question is, who will lead the Syndicate to a new era?
[251:21.69]Viola and Kiki were Mr. Loren's right hands.
[251:26.54]I had someone else in mind.
[251:30.18]Excuse me?
[251:30.92]The Syndicate has to answer for what they did.
[251:34.44]And this time, we're taking the fight to them.
[251:36.95]Since we don't know Steel Ford, I brought in some people who do.
[251:39.39]This is Kinzie, Zemos, and Angel.
[251:43.89]The barbarians are at the gates!
[251:45.51]We need a general, not an ambassador!
[251:47.78]Calm down, Eddie.
[251:51.10]I'm sorry, Venom.
[251:51.66]I knew you were gonna say Venom.
[251:53.88]It was so bad.
[251:54.22]I know.
[251:54.36]That's why I did it.
[251:54.98]I purposely did that so you would hate me.
[251:58.90]Level 10?
[252:35.82]We do hate you.
[252:46.28]What would I get new here?
[252:47.10]New car?
[252:48.92]Let me try this thing.
[253:07.15]And I'll try this thing.
[253:08.89]And I'll put the sniper rifle on too.
[253:10.47]Oh no, what's this?
[253:11.56]Yeah.
[253:14.04]Upgrades?
[253:17.26]Let me check it out.
[253:17.94]Ooh, this is nice.
[253:22.19]Alright, I need to go to a gun place.
[253:24.73]Bling shotgun?
[253:49.50]You knew I had to do it.
[253:50.56]I had to do it once.
[253:53.08]Purchase the hospital?
[253:54.00]Yeah, let's go!
[253:56.29]Mine now.
[253:57.59]That was fast travel, man.
[253:59.77]I did that on purpose.
[254:06.07]Alright, what else you got?
[254:06.71]Missions.
[254:11.52]Snatch?
[254:12.66]Snatch?
[254:18.02]Oh my god, I'm not even touching people.
[254:19.94]I need a gun, please.
[254:47.49]There we go.
[254:58.02]Huh?
[254:59.22]I just shot that guy in the shoulder and he didn't even care.
[255:02.86]What are you... Excuse me.
[255:06.28]Excuse me?
[255:18.05]Are these bullets?
[255:20.27]What am I shooting at?
[255:22.28]He's dead.
[255:23.24]Okay, I got him.
[255:30.02]Okay, what the hell is happening?
[255:38.19]Alright.
[255:39.39]What is shooting at me?
[255:51.69]It's Herobrine.
[255:58.90]Herobrine.
[256:09.48]You know, I've never seen Herobrine before.
[256:11.77]And that's crazy scary, right?
[256:13.17]Should I buy the casino?
[256:17.03]How much is it?
[256:17.41]10 grand, let's go!
[256:20.65]Mine now.
[256:29.46]Herobrine's not real?
[256:30.68]Is it?
[256:31.16]Like, okay, wait.
[256:32.58]I'm gonna tell you what I think Herobrine is.
[256:35.92]I don't have a lot of experience with a lot of the Minecraft stuff.
[256:38.88]So Herobrine, if I'm wrong here, tell me.
[256:42.57]It's just Minecraft Steve.
[256:45.53]And he just drops explosive TNTs in every direction and blows up everything.
[256:50.94]That's it, right?
[256:52.98]And he's got like a 0.0002% chance to spawn.
[256:59.79]No?
[257:03.57]What do you guys have?
[257:04.05]What's your problem?
[257:08.87]Don't talk about him.
[257:18.86]Why are you coming down?
[257:20.22]Oh, you're in a... Okay, I thought that... That's so beat up.
[257:22.22]I didn't think it was a squad car.
[257:30.96]Are they smart?
[257:46.19]Damn, I'm good.
[257:48.73]Alright, we're safe.
[257:54.98]Dude!
[257:55.66]You didn't load the gun?!
[257:58.26]You had me!
[257:59.56]You had me!
[258:00.40]I was right there!
[258:02.04]You had me!
[258:12.83]Alright, it's enabled.
[258:25.30]Okay, we're good on ammo.
[258:27.66]Grenades.
[258:28.78]Okay.
[258:29.86]I'm gonna upgrade something.
[258:36.97]I like this gun.
[258:37.77]Let's get it upgraded.
[258:38.49]I have no money left.
[258:40.19]Okay, well, that's not good.
[258:44.21]Cool.
[258:44.39]Okay, I'm good.
[258:48.85]I'm gonna be making a lot of money an hour, though.
[258:53.76]Oh, here's the thing.
[258:54.30]This is the thing everybody wanted me to, like, do.
[258:55.54]There you go.
[259:02.24]I hope everybody laughed hysterically.
[259:04.65]Alright, so what is this?
[259:05.55]This is a major shotgun?
[259:11.89]Okay.
[259:12.49]What about this?
[259:13.65]Grenade launcher?
[259:15.41]Yeah, cool.
[259:17.07]Alright.
[259:18.32]I'm into it.
[259:22.22]And I just upgraded this.
[259:23.32]Okay, cool.
[259:25.42]Very cool.
[259:26.96]I got a long way to go.
[259:28.58]I need a car.
[259:54.61]Cross the highway.
[259:55.25]Alright, I need a car.

[260:32.11]Where's the phone?
[260:32.65]I don't want to take a shit in the middle of the street.
[260:40.86]How do I open the phone?

[261:37.73]You're going to punch me in the face?
[261:38.97]Why are you aiming?
[261:39.71]You're going to punch me in the face.

[263:00.01]Okay, why would I not just use this?
[263:09.55]Because it's slow?
[263:19.64]But it's a tank.
[263:22.22]We will always get to our destination safely, no matter what.
[263:28.63]Oh, I gotta go 5, 8,000 feet.
[263:30.49]You're right, never mind.
[263:33.77]That's a long way to go.
[263:51.77]This thing breaks like shit.

[264:04.15]It did not hit me in the head though.
[264:06.13]Okay, where's the garage?

[265:24.00]Shut up.
[265:46.33]Oh, no, I thought I was supposed to get off.
[265:59.43]You should have bought the remaster.
[266:00.55]I didn't know the remaster existed.
[266:04.03]I just typed into Steam Saints Row 3 the 3rd and I just bought this one.
[266:09.13]There it is Saints Row the 3rd.
[266:24.02]Alright, so now what?
[266:29.40]The remaster is worse.
[266:32.33]That's what people kept saying.
[266:33.23]I don't know who to believe.
[266:35.31]Hey, Zemos.
[266:42.11]Shh.
[266:42.31]Don't wake the bitches.
[266:44.37]You don't waste time.
[266:45.73]Well, if you went on a ball gag with a horse tail up your ass for a few years, I think you'd want to unwind too.
[266:52.46]Fair enough.
[266:54.38]I'm guessing you ain't come here for the pussy.
[266:59.53]If the Saints are going to stay in Steelport, we need the Morningstar out of here.
[267:03.05]I already worked downtown and these motherfuckers are everywhere.
[267:06.39]Oh, I'm here to help, baby.
[267:07.99]I know every track the Morningstar are working.
[267:10.67]We can build up our stable and have the Dementor Sisters at the same time.
[267:15.88]Sounds good.
[267:18.52]I got my people out watching the corners letting me know where the bitches are.
[267:24.92]You got someplace I can stash them?
[267:26.40]Sure do.
[267:27.90]You just bring them on
[267:31.23]Can I upgrade?
[267:31.57]I want to upgrade the car.
[267:32.31]Do I have time to upgrade the car?
[267:37.31]Can I make it go faster?
[267:44.14]I got, I'll be alright.
[267:45.24]Alright, you can't, oh, come on, fine, whatever.
[267:49.22]This thing has a gun?
[267:52.28]Okay, this thing is insane.
[267:55.71]Wait, that person wants to take a picture with me.
[268:00.91]Always gotta stop for a fan.
[268:09.65]What's up?
[268:10.39]Alright, let's take a photo.
[268:14.54]Always.
[268:14.84]Ever.
[268:15.64]Anything for a fan.
[268:43.83]This is why I don't like face cam.
[268:45.01]I can't be on camera laughing.
[268:47.53]I can't be on camera laughing at that.
[268:50.13]See, when the face cam was off, you would just hear a couple of breaths, and that was it.
[268:57.62]What?
[268:57.96]Oh, wait.
[268:58.24]There's a mission going on.
[268:58.96]You're right.
[269:07.22]We're good.
[269:16.95]I'm so ready for a change.
[269:18.35]Thank you for rescuing me.
[269:19.46]Wait, that guy's alive!
[269:21.92]Hey!
[269:24.24]You're gonna take the car?
[269:26.20]Ooh, he just got super kicked.
[269:29.06]Alright, get in.
[269:30.20]Oh shit, there's only two seats.
[269:33.18]What do I do?
[269:37.98]I need a different car.
[269:38.58]I wish we were safe already.
[269:46.01]God damn it.
[269:46.45]I need to... I need to... Just get out.
[269:51.01]Get out.
[269:51.35]Get out.
[269:51.65]Get out.
[269:51.95]Get out.
[269:52.17]We're gonna... There's people just swarming me.
[270:09.86]No, get off.
[270:10.80]Where'd my head go?
[270:13.07]Okay.
[270:14.75]The...
[270:16.30]I feel like I'm playing Far Cry 5.
[270:17.72]Okay, we're good.
[270:22.54]I didn't have enough room in the car.
[270:24.78]I needed more room in the car and now I can fit people in this car.
[270:51.08]We're gonna burp.
[270:58.94]We're good.
[271:06.63]Everything's fine.
[271:08.95]Oh, god damn it.
[271:09.67]They were standing there.
[271:10.51]Fuck.
[271:14.05]I don't know why I thought they were... I thought they were off to the side for some reason.
[271:20.82]How did the burp taste?
[271:21.86]You're disgusting.
[271:23.96]Ban that person for five minutes.
[271:53.21]Stop pulling me out of the car.
[271:54.52]It's so annoying.
[272:04.04]What's happening?
[272:07.06]Fucking DD2.
[272:07.95]That's what I want to see.
[272:08.63]Alright, we're good.
[272:14.19]Get in the car.
[272:18.07]Stop having the Far Cry 5 truck with 10 people in it show up.
[272:30.06]Alright, get in!
[272:32.32]Come on, we can go go go go go!
[272:36.12]Oh my god, stop Far Cry 5-ing me!
[272:41.33]Get in!
[272:44.81]Get in!
[273:02.71]Oops.
[273:05.09]That guy.
[273:06.19]Okay.
[273:08.69]What do you want me to even say?
[273:10.01]What do you want me to say?
[273:12.19]I don't have anything to say.
[273:13.81]There's nothing I can say right now that you are not already observing as well.
[273:19.77]I have nothing else to say.
[273:22.25]We're watching the same thing.
[273:37.71]Describe the burp?
[273:39.06]It tastes like grapefruit juice.
[273:41.44]Relax and stop asking about it.
[273:51.13]Is this one more I need to get?
[273:57.67]Shit.
[273:58.03]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[274:23.71]Alright, alright, alright.
[274:28.57]Come on, come on.
[274:29.67]Get in!
[274:30.95]Get in!
[274:31.33]Get in!
[274:31.69]Did I just throw a grenade at somebody?
[274:34.19]What happened?
[274:35.42]Do not kill her!
[274:36.16]Is she alive?
[274:46.14]Alright, get in.
[274:46.85]Get in, get in, get in, get in, get in.
[274:49.41]Who's that?
[274:49.97]Who's this lady?
[274:51.77]Get in the fucking car.
[274:53.93]Oh my god, get in a car.
[274:55.42]Get in a car.
[275:19.20]Okay, no more jokes.
[275:19.90]I don't want to die.
[275:26.73]No!
[275:27.75]Get out!
[275:28.39]Get out!
[275:30.89]Are they okay?
[275:32.27]Are they okay?
[275:33.17]They're okay.
[275:33.61]They're okay.
[275:33.99]They're okay.
[275:34.39]They're okay.
[275:34.85]They're just both on fire.
[275:36.43]It's okay.
[275:37.25]It's going to be fine.
[275:37.77]Get in a different car.
[275:38.84]Get in a different car.
[275:40.20]Get in a different car.
[275:42.20]This is not even the same person that was with me before.
[275:44.30]Alright, we lost one.
[275:46.04]It's okay.
[275:46.34]It's alright.
[275:46.62]It's alright.
[275:46.88]It's alright.
[275:49.20]Everything is fine.
[275:51.04]Everything is going to be fine.
[275:53.72]Alright.
[275:56.32]I can't... What's happening?
[276:00.05]Thank goodness.
[276:02.79]We lost one.
[276:03.49]I didn't... I really did not... I was trying.
[276:17.22]Hey, this happened to my buddy Eric.
[276:22.46]I really don't... I really hate to be the person to tell you this, but your buddy Eric is a liar.
[276:28.67]I don't know if I would believe everything that he says.
[276:32.15]I feel like he embellishes a lot of stories.
[276:33.81]Maybe you can help me out.
[276:46.52]He would never.
[276:47.88]What am I doing?
[276:48.68]Don't act like you don't know Eric.
[277:18.64]Piss break?
[277:19.64]Yeah, after this I will.
[277:22.66]I will in a minute.
[277:25.36]Everybody knows Eric.
[277:26.14]Thought I was going to have way more forward motion there.
[277:40.54]Come on Jeremy, you need to eat potato soup?
[277:41.94]That sounds actually really good.
[277:44.75]What are you doing?
[278:01.75]What the fuck is going on?
[278:06.51]What was that?
[278:09.75]Far Cry 5, get this Far Cry 5 shit out of my game.
[278:20.48]I'm just waiting for an eagle to attack me.
[278:23.16]Or a huge bear just runs over and grabs me.
[278:26.40]You are pissing me off because you're being weird.
[278:35.07]What?
[278:39.75]What hap- what happened, man?
[278:41.82]What did you do?
[278:43.54]What did you do?
[278:44.24]I didn't get one person.
[278:52.16]Not one single person.
[278:53.30]There were probably 40 people standing right there and I didn't get one.
[278:56.51]Not one single person.
[279:00.07]That's annoying.
[279:17.58]I don't know.
[279:17.92]I don't know.
[279:18.54]I thought that guy was asleep.
[279:20.32]I was like, oh, why is that guy on the passenger side sleeping?
[279:23.30]Get out of here for a second.
[279:25.14]I thought he was actually sleeping.
[279:47.81]Turn the motion blur off?
[279:48.91]I don't know how.
[279:50.79]Oh my fucking god, dude.
[279:53.27]What the hell?
[279:54.67]What did I What did I do to make these people at every mission?
[279:57.95]They're at every single mission.
[280:00.03]A hundred of them.
[280:03.63]Nice juke.
[280:08.85]What?
[280:11.27]He left without paying.
[280:12.29]Kill him.
[280:13.29]Well, go get him.
[280:16.77]Go get him.
[280:18.61]Go drive to him!
[280:20.77]Go drive to him!
[280:21.74]Oh my god, you dumbass.
[280:23.18]You're lazy.
[280:44.53]You murdered their leader.
[280:45.97]Did you hear that?
[280:47.75]That was like... That's okay.
[280:50.63]He's just sleeping.
[281:17.70]Stop driving around like a fucking maniac.
[281:31.29]Do the deal.
[281:31.81]Oh, come on.
[281:38.03]Don't go back!
[281:51.01]Look at this fucking car, dude.
[281:53.31]What the fuck?
[281:56.31]Dude.
[281:57.71]What have you been doing?
[281:59.39]What have you been doing?
[282:00.13]Your car looks like a tiger.
[282:01.89]What?
[282:02.17]Where have you been?
[282:02.81]Where have you been?
[282:04.27]Your car looks like it's made out of aluminum foil.
[282:07.23]What the fuck happened?
[282:09.36]Where have you been?
[282:10.22]What have you been doing?
[282:15.80]You can't even do... Your car can't even get that fucked up if you try.
[282:29.75]Didn't I throw a grenade?
[282:33.50]There's way too many of these people that come in here, dude.
[282:36.00]I'm sorry.
[282:36.68]I'm gonna be honest.
[282:37.34]I've got a criticism of the game.
[282:39.02]There are 50 of these cars.
[282:40.32]Like, there are too many.
[282:41.34]There are way too many of these cars are showing up at every mission.
[282:44.16]Do you understand?
[282:44.94]They're everywhere.
[282:47.29]They're fucking everywhere.
[282:54.96]Did you take up smoking weed?
[282:57.00]Yeah.
[282:58.59]It actually tells a lot.
[283:04.43]For instance... Oh, that's just a cop.
[283:07.07]I've been pursued by the other gang more than the police.
[283:10.85]For every one police car, there's been ten of those other cars with the gang in it.
[283:20.42]I mean, I should actually fire back.
[283:28.02]Okay, we're good.
[283:33.23]Even smoking weed?
[283:34.15]No, I've been eating weed.
[283:35.66]There's a difference.
[283:42.13]This game just, yeah, this game got way more fun.
[283:44.85]The last, like, four hours have been so much more fun.
[283:47.81]That first, I don't know, you know, I think it was the audio being screwed up.
[283:51.96]And I didn't really have an opportunity to do anything.
[283:56.06]So, yeah, that first hour was, like, kind of a snooze.
[284:01.97]What about, okay, there's a lot of stuff.
[284:04.49]How about faster, more intense stuff?
[284:11.76]And I had the zombie voice, yeah.
[284:12.98]Andy.
[284:13.20]Okay.
[284:13.30]Go read the script.
[284:14.60]Yeah, I'll go pee in a minute.
[284:40.60]After this.
[284:40.96]Is this DLC?
[284:42.74]That's okay.
[284:43.20]That's fine.
[284:52.39]Oh, cool.
[284:52.93]Wait.
[284:56.23]I'm not going up.
[284:59.06]Well, what the hell?
[285:00.26]What are you... I'm trying to get a... Well, it looks like I'm just going over it now.
[285:05.64]I'm not going to wait for anything.
[285:12.41]I don't even want that fucking car.
[285:13.89]I'm doing that.
[285:14.53]I decided I gave up halfway through to make the cops think that I died down there.
[285:18.25]So they'll leave me alone.
[285:19.03]They'll think I'm dead.
[285:20.61]And then I'm going to call the kitty car and I'm going to go off it.
[285:22.62]That was all calculated.
[285:24.22]You don't think I did that on purpose?
[285:29.26]Holy shit, that's funny.
[285:34.65]Okay, vehicle delivery.
[285:35.65]Sexy kitten.
[285:37.57]Bring it to me.
[285:44.38]Where is it?
[285:47.09]Where's my car?
[285:48.93]Oh my god, what are you doing?
[285:56.05]What happened?
[286:01.08]Did you crash?
[286:05.44]Oh my god, your neck is your body.
[286:08.04]Your neck is your whole body.
[286:09.22]You're just a neck and legs.
[286:13.33]There's nothing wrong about that at all.
[286:17.61]Hold on, any picture.
[286:26.00]That's too weird to not document.
[286:33.69]No, I don't care.
[286:40.84]Help me, bro.
[286:41.50]I'm stuck.
[286:42.40]I don't... Where does this GPS want me to go?
[286:49.14]Does it snow in this game?
[287:12.71]It does?
[287:13.19]Punch it.
[287:49.25]Sick sick Sick
[288:14.99]Why does he look like that?
[288:16.08]I don't know.
[288:16.40]I just do.
[288:16.60]I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.
[288:27.46]Favorite kind of soup?
[288:31.30]Cheddar broccoli.
[288:32.33]Easy.
[288:33.37]A nice, thick, and creamy tomato soup.
[288:36.81]None of this runny bullshit.
[288:38.35]It's going to be really good, like thick tomato soup with a grilled cheese.
[288:42.43]Or don't fucking give it to me.
[288:45.48]Do you understand me?
[288:46.74]I'm asking you nicely.
[288:47.74]Is the script a problem?
[288:48.56]Just say the word, baby.
[288:49.92]We'll toss it.
[288:55.05]Oh, it's cool.
[288:55.99]I'm just... I'm gonna need cue cards like a motherfucker.

[298:56.65]You know what would be really funny?
[298:57.45]If we got to actually see a cut from all this.
[298:59.53]It would be amazing.
[299:01.49]This game gets a full letter grade higher if we get to watch the movie.
[299:04.60]And it's actually these scenes.
[299:07.06]We can only hope, right?
[299:09.22]We can't lose them in this primitive vehicle.
[299:14.64]Sorry, I forgot the line.
[299:15.34]How's that look?
[299:16.10]Thanks!
[299:16.28]We love to stay in character.

[300:38.21]Watch those explosions!
[300:57.31]Oh no, the set got crashed by actually, actual aliens?
[301:04.25]Wait, what's going on?
[301:05.37]I'm lost.
[301:15.76]That's part of the movie?
[301:17.68]Oh, I thought that we were getting, oh no, here comes another gang and they're aliens this time or something, I don't know.
[301:31.99]Well, okay, give me the benefit of the doubt here.
[301:34.30]There was an enemy in the very beginning of the game that had this purple kind of laser shit and was teleporting around.
[301:40.46]So, I don't know, I figured it was a different gang.
[301:42.70]I thought it was a different gang.
[301:43.66]The game from the first, like, ten minutes of the movie.
[301:50.44]The purple, neon, they teleport around with a... It was blue.
[301:54.17]Whatever.
[301:56.33]Same technology.
[301:57.15]It's pretty much the same technology.
[302:07.72]That's Saints Row 4.
[302:08.32]Oh, whatever.
[302:08.78]You know what I could go for right now?
[302:20.80]Just a big-ass chicken sandwich.
[302:25.54]A big chicken sandwich.
[302:26.55]A big-ass chicken sandwich.
[302:27.69]Are you fucking kidding me?
[302:30.17]Yeah.
[302:36.45]I'm talking the chicken patty or whatever is too big and is coming out the edges of the bun.
[302:48.58]It's a big circle and the bun is a little circle.
[303:05.75]That's really messy.
[303:06.77]Yeah, whatever.
[303:07.49]Who cares?
[303:12.05]And I want to grab it, and I want there to be mayo coming out the fucking sides.
[303:17.92]Like, right around the edges, you can tell they put way too much on.
[303:21.12]Way too much.
[303:22.20]But I want it.
[303:24.82]And a bunch of shredded lettuce.
[303:27.50]Shredded-ass lettuce, Swiss cheese, or anything.
[303:29.78]I would take a provolone.
[303:34.25]Sounds good.
[303:40.11]I want it wrapped in paper.
[303:44.11]I want it wrapped up in paper.
[303:45.13]Shredded lettuce.
[303:46.01]Oh my god.
[303:46.39]I want it wrapped in paper.
[304:08.03]The paper jump?
[304:08.79]Bad idea, bad idea, bad idea.
[304:15.42]What the hell was that, Jemima?
[304:17.86]A child could have made that jump.
[304:21.72]They're not even filming the right way.
[304:22.96]No thanks.
[304:23.28]I don't think I want to do that again.
[304:49.38]We're actually doing it again.
[304:51.27]Wait!
[304:51.63]Somebody wants to take a photo with me.
[304:54.99]No, no, no, no, no.
[304:55.95]Someone wants to take a photo with me.
[304:57.25]I want to take a picture with a fan!
[304:59.59]You guys think I can beat Smash TV in one sitting?
[305:17.77]Think I can beat Smash TV in one sitting?
[305:19.51]I have my doubts.
[305:20.43]Dude, when I bite into that chicken sandwich, I want to hear it from across the room.
[305:47.36]I want people to think I broke a tooth because it was a crunch.
[305:50.93]Like a crunch.
[305:52.83]I think we lost them.
[305:54.31]Here they come.
[305:58.45]I want to be like.
[306:01.67]And I want like juice to go down here.
[306:04.59]And I have to go.
[306:05.07]You should be safe.
[306:15.99]Now.
[306:18.43]You burnt it.
[306:18.95]Cut!
[306:19.73]That's a wrap for today!
[306:21.23]Amazing work from most of you.
[306:23.35]Not naming names, because I've already forgotten your names because you are worthless.
[306:27.43]Now get off my set!
[306:28.73]Oh my god.
[306:32.60]Where are all my Oh My God fans?
[306:34.94]Did the channel grow too much?
[306:36.68]How many of you guys weren't here for that?
[306:38.50]What are you talking about?
[306:51.88]That was a fun mission.
[307:05.38]You're jumping from joke to joke like you snorted 10 pixie sticks.
[307:12.01]Am I?
[307:12.47]I feel like I was pretty quiet for the last, like, 30 minutes.
[307:18.07]What is that, uh, just right that way?
[307:19.19]What is that?
[307:25.54]I feel like I'm pretty just muted today.
[307:28.58]I feel like I'm pretty collected today.
[307:29.94]What are you talking about?
[307:30.62]I talked about how I want a chicken sandwich and people think I'm making a joke about it.
[307:35.56]I'm telling you how I want my chicken sandwich.
[307:41.35]I'm describing my ideal chicken sandwich right now.
[307:44.85]This is not a comedy routine.
[307:49.25]That's very suspicious.
[307:54.92]Yeah, I'm being serious.
[308:00.42]That was a cool mission.
[308:02.32]Let's do... This one?
[308:08.45]What do I look like to you?
[308:22.30]What's your ideal breakfast?
[308:23.54]I got a pretty ideal breakfast.
[308:28.99]God damn it, I want this now so bad.
[308:30.39]More than the chicken... Way more than the chicken sandwich.
[308:36.43]I want what I'm about to describe to you, more than a chicken sandwich, by a hundred leagues.
[308:40.57]Okay.
[308:42.89]Okay.
[308:45.44]Corned beef hash.
[308:46.98]Two over medium eggs.
[308:49.46]Crispy bacon on the side.
[308:51.37]Maybe a couple of sausages and some toast.
[308:53.27]Oh.
[308:53.69]My.
[308:54.33]God.
[308:58.07]Corned beef hash and eggs.
[308:59.29]Oh.
[309:00.29]My.
[309:00.85]Goodness.
[309:04.14]Ugh.
[309:15.45]That sounds good.
[309:15.95]It is good.
[309:18.47]Yeah, and a carrot juice smoothie.
[309:20.27]Because I want to make sure I get, you know, I'm not just eating a bunch of greasy shit.
[309:35.58]Yeah, like a carrot and apple.
[309:36.92]A little bit of ginger in it.
[309:39.62]Just sip on it for like, oh my god, we could talk about anything.
[309:47.84]If I had a carrot, orange, and ginger smoothie or juice, I could sit there and just pretend to be interested in anything you were saying for at least an hour or two.
[309:58.31]Just leaning back like, yeah.
[310:01.03]Yeah, yeah.
[310:09.78]Wait, what am I doing?
[310:11.88]Keep the paparazzi away from the car?
[310:19.28]I'm so confused.
[310:20.08]What's going on?
[310:24.04]What?
[310:24.18]Don't get close to the news van.
[310:25.80]Evade the significant other.
[310:28.48]So why don't I just bait them and have them go over the edge?
[310:52.37]The client wants me to do damage?
[310:55.49]Is that good enough for you?
[310:58.23]One at a time, both, whatever.
[310:59.81]Just don't stop.
[311:01.09]They're not too rough.
[311:06.27]Do a power slide?
[311:07.57]Don't you think it's a little unsafe?
[311:13.23]Okay, there you go.
[311:15.45]This would make a hell of a sex tape.
[311:18.37]I love it when they're pinched.
[311:24.81]Get two vehicle near misses in a row.
[311:29.69]We are not okay.
[311:36.87]You'll be ready for more soon.
[311:38.91]Your tongue is crazy good.
[311:40.93]Do you have to talk this whole... I don't want to even know what's... I don't want to hear this.
[311:48.69]I don't know.
[311:49.15]What are you doing back here?
[311:50.33]What's happening?
[311:53.29]Why are you saying this?
[311:54.00]I don't want to hear this.
[311:56.92]What's going on back here?
[311:59.52]I have more in mind for you.
[312:01.54]Next time I'll be ready for your magic.
[312:03.10]I don't want to hear people having sex in my car.
[312:25.46]It was just a magic show.
[312:29.34]It was just a private magic show.
[312:37.04]That's funny.
[312:37.90]Now that you're back in business, we can focus on the Morningstar.
[312:40.76]You need to slow down, baby.
[312:43.86]No time.
[312:44.76]Wrong car.
[312:46.32]I got something here to show you.
[312:49.65]What for?
[312:50.27]I've been helping you out, right?
[312:53.39]Human me.
[312:54.87]Fine.
[313:06.47]Watch out.
[313:06.91]There's a fight going to break out.
[313:09.91]Look out.
[313:10.19]This is the best mission coming up.
[313:12.41]Okay.
[313:27.38]Who crashed?
[313:27.99]I didn't.
[314:08.98]Move out of the way, I'm doing something.
[314:17.43]I knocked the phone over, but not him.
[314:21.19]He's Fortnite dancing.
[314:22.69]He deserves to die!
[314:36.92]Why did he start doing that?
[314:41.75]Why did he do that?
[314:42.81]What was that sound?
[315:06.53]Fight or flight response.
[315:08.61]What the fuck are people doing?
[315:11.01]Fight or flight response when you see a Fortnite dance.
[315:17.79]That was so bizarre.
[315:19.29]I didn't know what to do.
[315:20.01]He was trying to defuse the situation.
[315:29.53]Fortnite dances are so cool.
[315:31.23]They're so cute.
[315:31.99]I love it.
[315:35.39]Fucking Philistine.
[315:36.93]What you know about art?
[315:37.97]That's at the Winter Sisters Original.
[315:40.64]Bought that back in the day when me and the twins were all live and let live.
[315:45.13]Well, seeing as how we just let them know we're taking over their business, I doubt that deal's gonna hold.
[315:50.45]Shit.
[315:51.25]Remember the pony show?
[315:52.84]I've been off that Christmas list a long time.
[315:55.78]Anyway, I didn't call you over to talk about me.
[315:59.06]You killed Philippe Laurent and showed the Morningstar that you are here to stay.
[316:04.26]Time to relax and cut loose, baby.
[316:06.16]Why was he... I'm so confused.
[316:07.84]We'll party once the work's done.
[316:10.09]I'll call you when I make another move against the Morningstar.
[316:14.52]I just woke up.
[316:15.00]Is he still a medic?
[316:15.76]Yep.
[316:18.77]Should I change the... Wait, I have a boat?
[316:33.88]Oh, that's a... I thought that was a boat.
[316:35.88]I thought that was a big yacht.
[316:38.62]It's a hat.
[316:43.59]Okay.
[316:45.80]Disappointing, in a way.
[316:47.02]Okay, I need a scout costume.
[317:02.07]What do we got?
[317:02.69]Just like a red t-shirt, right?
[317:15.53]I wonder if they just have a red t-shirt.
[317:16.87]I'd probably buy it.
[317:17.85]Yeah, I'd have to buy it.
[317:26.37]I'll go buy it.
[317:31.46]How do I get the hell out of here?
[317:40.68]I'm trying to leave.
[317:41.74]I'm sorry.
[317:42.26]I'm not trying to hurt anybody.
[317:43.79]I'm just trying to leave the house.
[317:46.71]It's hard to see out of this fucking mask, okay?
[317:50.13]Are we good?
[317:50.83]We're good.
[317:56.03]Okay.
[318:08.18]How do I get out of here?
[318:11.58]How come I can't Fortnite dance?
[318:17.76]Woo!
[318:17.98]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun
[318:43.41]What's going on?
[318:49.76]Hostage?
[318:50.26]I have a hostage.
[318:57.88]Are we alright?
[318:58.39]I thought he had ice cream the whole fucking time.
[319:03.49]Are you kidding me?
[319:05.31]How do you still have the ice cream in your hand?
[319:07.47]The airbag didn't even deploy.
[319:10.49]No way.
[319:13.86]No way.
[319:14.26]You wanna join a gang?
[319:21.11]I can't move.
[319:29.70]I'm stuck on her.
[319:33.74]I don't like that.
[319:34.38]I'm out.
[319:51.07]Person's lost.
[319:57.71]I killed that person.
[320:00.71]Someone's watching you on their fridge.
[320:05.01]I'm not responsible.
[320:05.87]I am not responsible for you overheating the screen on your fridge.
[320:09.43]By the way.
[320:12.19]I'm just telling you, I'm not responsible if you overheat the screen on your fridge.
[320:20.49]How much money do I have?
[320:24.09]Ooh, I have a lot.
[320:24.77]I've got a lot of money.
[320:26.32]I actually have a lot of money.
[320:33.40]I don't want one of the mods to get pinged about like, oh, hey, so I did this thing.
[320:38.02]I can't get Jerma's stream off my fridge.
[320:39.74]I hacked my fridge screen.
[320:42.46]Can you help?
[320:43.60]No.
[320:44.14]No help.
[320:45.77]No help.
[320:47.11]Uh-uh.
[320:51.64]I wanted that car.
[320:58.42]Alright, I need to go to a closed place.
[321:03.81]Should I go to Tat- no, I can't even see it.
[321:09.31]This is probably the closest.
[321:11.21]Oh no, this one is over here.
[321:16.05]We're gonna get a scout outfit.
[321:29.90]Oh, dude, that's so- I wish I could- If I had an umbrella, I'd give it to you.
[321:33.80]I would literally- If I had an umbrella, I would give it to you, and I would just get rained on.
[321:39.39]I would give it to you, and you could keep it.
[321:41.27]I wouldn't even care.
[321:45.79]I really would.
[321:47.19]That sucks.
[321:48.05]Obviously, you got somewhere to go.
[321:51.12]You got somewhere to go.
[321:54.22]The paper's gonna get soggy.
[321:55.32]The ink is gonna get all over your hands and shit.
[322:01.20]What's wrong?
[322:03.62]Why is he running screaming?
[322:06.73]I fell.
[322:07.81]You didn't need to... You call me an asshole?
[322:16.33]He's scared.
[322:20.52]Alright, I'm taking... I'm taking that.
[322:23.86]I'm taking that.
[322:24.42]That's mine now.
[322:36.02]This guy's driving so erratically.
[322:38.00]I'll take good care of it.
[322:39.94]Okay, wait, I have another hostage.
[322:44.44]Do I?
[322:44.70]Alright, what do I do?
[322:47.46]Alright, 45 seconds and I'm good.
[322:49.02]Can I get paid or something?
[322:51.06]Why is there a sniper shooting at me?
[322:54.10]What the fuck are you doing?
[322:57.18]What could you possibly be doing?
[323:02.80]What could you possibly be doing?
[323:06.13]Why is your Mack truck perpendicular on the road?
[323:11.13]There's no reason why anyone would do that.
[323:15.06]That was insane.
[323:19.52]The person blue screened the screen on their fridge, by the way.
[323:24.72]Nice job.
[323:25.78]I'm not responsible for it.
[323:30.04]Damn, maniac.
[323:34.35]Good.
[323:36.35]Oh, no, maybe not.
[323:37.41]Oh, it's burnt in.
[323:40.97]Right.
[323:46.40]You know what?
[323:46.82]I want your car.
[323:47.58]Can I have that, please?
[323:51.00]Oh, I can be.
[324:11.14]Get this off of me.

[331:35.20]I don't know how to do math.

[331:43.82]That was crazy.
[331:47.60]Okay, can I get a car?

[332:03.60]It's time to go.
[332:05.26]I'm gonna go to the party that I was supposed to... I was been invited to.
[332:07.82]I got invited to a party.
[332:08.70]None of these people did.
[332:10.24]I got invited to a cool party.
[332:11.42]Okay.
[332:22.81]Somebody is unloading.
[332:25.33]From where?
[332:29.07]Is it you?
[332:32.32]That person... I thought that person was shooting at me.
[332:34.32]Who's shooting at me?
[332:35.30]From what direction?
[332:41.30]This person in the truck has been a menace.
[332:44.94]They've been just driving around.
[332:46.10]This motherfucker's... This motherfucker's caused the whole thing.
[332:49.50]That person caused the whole thing.
[332:51.69]Yeah, watch this.
[332:52.35]Yeah, oh yeah.
[332:54.76]Yeah, oh, oh, sure, you're safe!
[332:56.28]You're a safe driver.
[332:57.56]Safe driver.
[332:58.30]You caused the whole thing, man!
[333:04.72]Can I go to the options?
[333:05.52]Do I have a mod on?
[333:07.12]Like a cheat where people are just fucking crazy?
[333:10.97]I feel like I have a mod on that's like, oh, pedestrians and cars are fucking insane, right?
[333:15.63]I feel like this shouldn't be happening.
[333:20.89]I don't.
[333:21.79]There's no cheats on or anything.
[333:22.89]I feel like there are.
[333:25.07]They're all scared of you.
[333:28.99]Should I take the pizza delivery car?
[333:31.05]I'll take the Domino's car.
[333:44.44]Get out of the road.
[333:45.16]I mean...
[333:48.76]If I see a situation that looks a little dire or looks a little scary, I'm not going to step on the pedal as hard as I can and drive as fast as I can into all the other cars or directly into a wall so I fly out the fucking windshield.
[334:08.18]Why?
[334:10.70]That's not a way to get away from danger.
[334:14.11]You don't push the gas all the way to the ground and just scream while you drive into everybody.
[334:20.32]You turn around.
[334:22.10]That was fucking hilarious.
[334:28.44]Oh my god.
[334:33.98]Johnny's dead and you're throwing a fucking party.
[334:36.30]I forgot I was a skeleton.
[334:37.14]You say it like that, sure sound bad.
[334:39.64]I was saddled up in a human pony show.
[334:43.12]But you see me crying about a little girl?
[334:45.18]I swear to God, I will shove that thing down your throat.
[334:48.63]Whoa, Shondy.
[334:50.39]We can't mourn Gat forever.
[334:51.99]Eventually, you gotta get back on the horse.
[334:54.93]No offense, brother.
[334:56.31]He's right.
[334:58.37]Whatever.
[335:00.80]Actually, I do look like that right now.
[335:03.31]You know what I'm saying?
[335:04.95]I put on a t-shirt.
[335:07.73]And I think I look alright, but then you look in a mirror and you turn to the side and it's like, Jesus.
[335:12.89]I have like a stomach.
[335:15.52]And I have big ass and hips and shit.
[335:18.50]I actually kind of look like that.
[335:19.44]What's up, girl?
[335:21.36]What's up?
[335:30.60]Watch it.
[335:33.40]Watch it!
[335:34.04]Watch it!
[335:34.56]Oh shit!
[335:35.28]These holes ain't holes!
[335:46.39]I always... Your party sucks!
[335:56.12]Can't we worry about the crazy bitches with guns?
[336:01.35]Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[336:03.11]Got it.
[336:03.31]Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.
[336:09.19]Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.
[336:13.54]Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.
[336:24.73]No, I don't want, I want the bat.
[336:26.49]I want the bat.
[336:27.13]This is not, this is not on brand.
[336:30.46]That's not on brand.
[336:31.08]I need the bat.
[336:32.85]I need the bat.
[336:33.29]That's not on brand.
[336:40.91]There's a scattergun.
[336:41.57]Alright, cool.
[336:53.61]I don't know if that was a good... I don't know if that was a good... I don't know.
[336:58.78]Who's good and who's bad?
[336:59.90]I don't know.
[337:00.56]Are you good?
[337:02.28]I guess not.
[337:08.43]Revive?
[337:08.91]Where?
[337:10.23]Where are you?
[337:10.65]Where are they?
[337:11.67]Are they upstairs?
[337:13.17]Oh shit, they're upstairs.
[337:23.65]You picked the worst fucking place to die.
[337:30.97]Whoa, what happened?
[337:31.77]Machine guns.
[337:32.41]No they're not.
[337:33.68]I thought there was machine guns on the wall.
[337:35.54]They must have cut it.
[337:36.82]This just gets better and better.
[337:59.98]Looks like there's a light show outside.
[338:02.51]Snipers.
[338:03.23]Better grab a rifle and get up top.
[338:04.91]On it.
[338:05.49]Sniper.
[338:08.81]Are you good?
[338:11.71]No.
[338:18.92]Sniper.
[338:20.06]Oh.
[338:22.86]Do I get it?
[338:25.32]Get up to the roof.
[338:37.34]I got you, I see you.
[338:38.22]Do the rest!
[339:11.62]There are so many snipers everywhere.
[339:12.96]Oh my God, they're every direction, man.
[339:24.76]Where is this person shooting from?
[339:27.62]From where?
[339:29.27]Oh, from down there.
[339:32.09]Sniper's are down.
[339:32.85]Let's get some power up in here.
[339:35.01]I'm tired of tripping over bodies.
[339:37.69]That shit's downstairs, after you.
[339:44.12]What?
[339:46.90]Are you on my team?
[339:50.77]Alright, take the other gun out.
[340:04.92]Power.
[340:10.52]Somebody's watching on a 2003 Dell Axon Pocket PC.
[340:13.28]How?
[340:13.54]How?
[340:13.72]Isn't that impossible?
[340:14.64]Giga Chad.
[340:33.14]It's a screenshot from my phone cropped to 320 by 240 and uploaded to an SD card on the pocket PC.
[340:44.59]While you guys all say nothing is impossible.
[340:48.53]That's so funny.
[340:51.09]I love that.
[340:53.05]Alright, we gotta go up.
[340:57.99]Where are my friends?
[341:03.46]Friends?
[341:03.72]Where are they?
[341:05.66]Go take an edible break?
[341:09.10]What if on the Smite Tournament I just got fucking really high?
[341:12.24]Do you think I would do better?
[341:17.85]Just don't tell anybody.
[341:21.81]Can I not?
[341:22.71]Where's his weapon?
[341:27.11]Can I not use the elevator?
[341:33.35]You should do it.
[341:34.03]I don't know.
[341:34.51]I feel like it's really embarrassing on a national stage.
[341:37.01]You know what I mean?
[341:38.01]I mean, there's going to be a ton... There's like a hundred streamers or something doing this.
[341:43.88]I think Mizkip's going to probably... I don't know about maybe... I think he's probably going to cast it or something.
[341:49.20]I don't know.
[341:49.73]That would be embarrassment on a national stage.
[342:11.53]Because I might forget what my moves are, and then I've been talking all this shit about how I know what I'm doing.
[342:32.32]See you later.
[342:35.02]Goodbye.
[342:45.23]Stop moving around so much.
[343:00.62]Bingo.
[343:03.44]Bingo!
[343:09.71]Big money!
[343:11.31]Big prizes!
[343:12.57]I love it!
[343:19.54]I failed hooker assassins they came highly recommended ladies it was a pretty plan go pee tell me something I think I think I'm alright I think we'll just go to six hours and then I'll um I'll call it there's a reason philippe left the thinking to us we're done here
[343:52.56]But it's not too late.
[343:54.41]There's still time to grab Apollo's chariot and drive that fucker back across the sky.
[344:00.83]You feel me?
[344:03.61]Yes, Kilby.
[344:07.40]Apology accepted.
[344:08.66]So again, let's go over the schedule.
[344:09.88]I'll come to a VIP faster murder brawl.
[344:13.00]It's my tournament.
[344:14.84]27th, so exactly two days from right now.
[344:18.26]Then after the Smite Tournament, green screen night.
[344:20.12]It's going to be wild.
[344:21.68]I wouldn't miss the green screen night.
[344:23.65]It's going to be crazy.
[344:30.15]Is it hot in Vegas?
[344:30.93]Yes, it is.
[344:32.75]But I like it out here like that, though.
[344:35.03]The 100 degree... Hold on.
[344:38.88]Let me take these out.
[344:40.22]Let's take in two, three deep breaths.
[344:46.46]Okay.
[344:46.94]What I was trying to say is... I like hot.
[344:51.50]I like the 100 plus days.
[344:59.71]Something about it.
[345:00.25]It's just so searing.
[345:02.64]But you don't sweat.
[345:04.06]And that's people getting trouble out here because they come out here and it's a dry heat so they're not sweating.
[345:08.19]They go, wow, this is great.
[345:09.89]I feel awesome.
[345:11.39]And they drink like fucking 10 beers.
[345:14.61]It's like, dude, you've got to drink water.
[345:16.43]Even if you're not sweating, you're still getting dehydrated.
[345:21.24]So make sure you drink a lot of water out here.
[345:29.62]Only a maniac likes hot weather.
[345:31.62]Why?
[345:34.34]Really?
[345:34.60]I got a broom?
[345:44.20]I don't know how to turn this off.
[345:46.32]I don't know.
[345:46.90]I can't control this.
[345:49.31]I'm alive.
[345:50.47]How do I control this?
[345:54.41]Switch mode?
[345:55.21]I don't get it.
[346:07.49]I don't know how... I just evaporated.
[346:21.25]Get me back up there.
[346:21.93]There was like a bunch of stuff.
[346:25.45]Where was that?
[346:26.01]Where was that safe house?
[346:28.36]Where was that?
[346:28.88]Is it right here?
[346:31.30]Where was that?
[346:31.98]I want to do the other stuff.
[346:34.69]Where was that?
[346:37.53]Why is it always raining?
[346:38.79]It's always raining.
[346:41.89]Is this snow in this game?
[346:59.87]Yes?
[347:00.89]Aww.
[347:07.37]Is it this one here?
[347:17.77]Boat dog?
[347:18.27]No.
[347:18.63]Where is it?
[347:28.98]Is it the Saints HQ?
[347:31.24]That's so far away.
[347:33.70]Fuck.
[347:35.36]Okay, let's go.
[347:43.41]I didn't know this game had a map.
[347:52.18]What is going on?
[348:05.84]Have you not peed?
[348:07.60]I think my body has just utilized every piece of hydration that I gave it.
[348:11.98]I drank like a 24-ounce special green tea drink.
[348:17.19]And then I had like 16 ounces of water right before that, before the stream.
[348:21.41]I think I've utilized every penny.
[348:23.63]I wonder if she's free later.
[348:29.94]Ooh.
[348:37.44]Okay, let me try this again.
[348:48.31]Alright, up to the roof.
[348:50.45]Where's the roof?
[348:52.73]How do I get to the roof?
[348:56.82]Teleport, there we go.
[348:57.82]I need to get to the roof.
[349:00.70]Alright, look at this thing.
[349:04.85]What is this?
[349:06.09]What is that?
[349:06.61]It's like a Star Wars vehicle.
[349:07.81]I want to try this.
[349:10.29]Oh God.
[349:12.99]How do you fly?
[349:18.78]How do you fly?
[349:21.54]A is up.
[349:23.58]X is down.
[349:25.14]This is a blazer.
[349:31.30]How do I fly faster?
[349:37.05]How do you fly?
[349:39.49]Okay, that's hover mode.
[349:42.28]Okay.
[349:43.62]How high can I go?
[350:04.35]Where's the skybox?
[350:19.82]Let's take out the fucking sun.
[350:42.15]Oh my goodness, I'm high up.
[350:44.09]Can I go far even further?
[351:13.57]I didn't go anywhere.
[351:14.77]Just taking too long to fly.
[352:04.39]I thought I was gonna be able to do it!
[352:11.05]I was so close, I was lined up perfectly, I just went a little too flaaaast!
[352:15.74]Oh, that would've been amazing.
[352:18.00]If I parachuted and I landed on top of it and just got back in it.
[352:20.64]Oh my god, it would've been unbelievable.
[352:22.72]Fuck, that sucks.
[352:25.87]Oh, that would've been amazing.
[352:27.05]Oh, man.
[352:32.67]You're looking really white.
[352:34.07]That's because the... I didn't mean to press that button, but whatever.
[352:45.06]That was almost a best gamer moment.
[352:46.32]It could have been.
[352:48.22]It could have been.
[352:48.90]But so close, but so far.
[352:50.56]All the... Getting that lined up perfectly.
[352:52.34]I landed right on the cockpit window.
[352:55.50]And I was slowing down.
[352:56.54]I was really controlling the speed to the very end.
[352:58.60]And it was a little too fast.
[353:00.26]God, that's...
[353:02.31]It stinks.
[353:03.91]It's okay.
[353:12.55]That would have been a 10 million viewed YouTube short.
[353:15.41]I know.
[353:15.93]Damn it.
[353:29.61]Okay.
[353:30.99]Why do you look so ugly?
[353:32.79]Huh?
[353:33.09]I need to see.
[353:41.19]It's because the exposure is blown out.
[353:43.27]I'll fix it.
[353:53.12]There.
[353:54.14]I'm not all blown out now.
[353:56.43]There.
[353:56.91]Better.
[353:57.43]Say it was all of a sudden blown out.
[353:59.13]People don't look like that.
[354:06.70]Time that person out for... One day.
[354:27.54]What was that?
[354:28.06]Alright, that's it.
[354:38.29]I'll see you guys later.
[354:40.21]I will see you guys on the 27th, so not tomorrow, but the day after, for a Smite tournament.
[354:47.43]This is for $100,000, so there's a lot on the line here.
[354:51.85]There are major stakes in this tournament.
[354:55.69]That was really fun.
[354:56.41]The first 45 minutes, that was, eh, it was kind of, I don't know, it wasn't having a good time.
[355:01.76]I didn't like the tutorial.
[355:03.80]But that's why you stick with it.
[355:05.50]Because six hours later, that was really fun.
[355:07.98]I'm glad I played it.
[355:08.96]That was a great time.
[355:12.99]I'm going to save it just in case there's any reason why I'm back in it again.
[355:18.69]But yeah, $100,000 tournament.
[355:21.86]I think we have a pretty good team.
[355:23.20]I know there are other teams that are very good, so... I'm gonna brush up on the Smite maybe a little bit.
[355:29.68]And then on the 30th, I'll see you for the green screen stream.
[355:39.75]Is it 1v1?
[355:40.49]No, it is Conquest 5v5, so that's gonna be very interesting, isn't it?
[355:45.25]It's gonna be very interesting.
[355:50.99]Yeah, green screen's the 30th.
[355:52.83]Smite, big Smite tournament in a couple of days.
[355:56.35]That's kind of the plan for the week.
[355:59.31]Well, week as in, I mean, the next three streams, right?
[356:06.12]And then we'll see what happens next weekend.
[356:08.44]But I'll see you guys in a couple of days.
[356:11.80]Wish us luck.
[356:13.38]It's going to be a pretty intense competition, so hopefully we do well.
[356:20.95]All in all, I don't really care.
[356:22.91]I think it's just going to be a fun time.
[356:24.47]So that's all I care about.
[356:27.97]Cuphead DLC comes out next week as well.
[356:29.89]Well, I can tell you what we're doing.
[356:33.73]I am without a even tiny bit of a doubt going to play that at launch.
[356:38.93]Guaranteed.
[356:45.97]What about DreadX?
[356:47.77]There's opportunity to do that.
[356:48.99]Tons of opportunity to do... There's a lot of games to play.
[356:58.01]He won't play it at launch?
[356:58.87]Yes, I will.
[356:59.83]I'm going to play it at launch.
[357:00.53]I'll try to.
[357:07.66]But thanks for all the subs, everybody.
[357:09.76]I know I was gone for a while.
[357:13.72]Trying to stream and do a bunch of personal stuff, life stuff, project stuff.
[357:23.61]But I'm very excited.
[357:24.33]I think we have at least two or three really, really fun things coming up.
[357:29.99]I'm really looking forward to the actual green screen night after all the footage is out there for a couple of weeks.
[357:37.16]July is going to have some cool stuff in it.
[357:51.62]Green screen hype.
[357:53.30]Yeah, that will probably be the last time I go in front of the green screen.
[357:55.94]I think it's a good trilogy.
[358:01.78]But yeah.
[358:02.64]Thanks, guys.
[358:03.06]Thanks for watching.
[358:04.50]Good to see you again.
[358:06.23]See you in a couple days.
[358:10.39]Have a great rest of your night, as always.
[358:13.83]Take care of yourselves.
[358:16.71]Call your mother.
[358:20.95]And have a great night.
[358:24.05]Goodbye.
[358:25.66]For now.
[358:53.43]you
[359:28.31]you
