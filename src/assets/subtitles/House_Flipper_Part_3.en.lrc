[00:03.09]Hi there.
[00:05.65]G'day.
[00:07.23]How are things?
[00:09.73]Hope you guys are doing well.
[00:10.81]I'm doing okay.
[00:13.59]I've been better.
[00:14.83]For one reason.
[00:17.21]I had a fun time in the car today.
[00:19.73]I got bit in the corner of my nose where my eye meets my nose by a fly.
[00:24.71]That was fucking fun.
[00:29.83]That was a blast.
[00:33.91]flew right in the window and it just bit me right inside where my eye meets my nose it's all it's like full of liquid it's huge it's bulbous I feel if I touch it it's gonna it's horrible no I'm just kidding yeah I'm talking to you guys right now I put a minor inconvenience I had or a small fly bit me on the nose I'm perfectly fine there's not even a mark there I'm over exaggerating for the stream
[01:02.66]But hi, how are you?
[01:04.76]Good to see you.
[01:06.20]Hope you're having a good day.
[01:07.58]We're going to play House Flipper again tonight.
[01:10.75]Had a relaxing weekend.
[01:13.83]Or tried to.
[01:14.39]A lot of stress the last few months.
[01:21.01]Trying to pull it back a little.
[01:22.54]Get stuff done.
[01:25.22]And move.
[01:27.82]How does a fly bite?
[01:28.76]I don't know.
[01:34.16]That was a water park?
[01:35.08]A water park was okay.
[01:37.90]I mean, it was about... Took us a while to get there.
[01:41.81]And the whole time, the entire time, we were singing different songs.
[01:48.70]We were doing duets and shit like that all the way there.
[01:52.47]And we did a thing where we once, twice, three-shooted about who got to go down first.
[01:57.68]And I don't want to be an asshole about this, but if you once, twice, three-shoot with somebody... And you lose... Then you can't just say it didn't count and that we have to do it again.
[02:09.27]We were in line on the... The name of the ride is the Denominator.
[02:16.83]It's hard to say.
[02:17.47]They made it that way on purpose.
[02:19.39]So the Denominator is a long slide...
[02:22.90]Tons of water on it.
[02:23.74]It's really fun.
[02:24.36]It's like an 88 degree angle and We once twice three shoot it in the car, and then he didn't like the outcome so we once twice three shoot it again in the line and Before he had a chance to determine that he lost It's all right dude.
[02:38.50]I know you're just I'm gonna go first He's like pushed me out of the way and went down slide And then the guy put the bar in front of me, and I couldn't go down By the way I drove there I've seen any gas money for that by the way
[02:55.60]No, how are you doing?
[02:56.44]Let's go.
[02:57.02]House Flipper.
[03:00.70]Year-long joke.
[03:04.36]But look, hold on, hold on.
[03:06.32]I'm going to turn this off.
[03:08.30]It wasn't a year-long joke as much as it was like a year-long complacency between the two of us, right?
[03:18.64]It wasn't like a, oh hey, I got an idea, star.
[03:21.32]Here's a funny idea.
[03:22.30]Why don't we just pretend to hate each other for a year?
[03:25.29]No.
[03:27.31]It was just, we just both would do another shit.
[03:33.67]Year-long joke sounds better.
[03:36.49]But I don't want to imply to people that we were in cahoots.
[03:41.17]Like, oh, hey, by the way, these fucking people have no idea.
[03:44.89]Hey, you and me?
[03:45.63]Hey, you and me are best friends, but hey, let's pretend.
[03:48.17]Like, fuck these people.
[03:49.79]I don't want you to think that that's what happened.
[03:53.05]It was a social experiment gone wrong.
[03:58.67]Anyways, how are you?
[04:03.77]I know he cleared this up a little bit on the stream, but also I can add to that too.
[04:09.97]Yeah, I mean, we pushed off that, you know, us talking again and hanging out on stream for a while.
[04:17.33]And it did get to a point where he was saying all kinds of crazy shit on stream.
[04:21.46]And I would contact him and be like, hey, I don't know if you should do that.
[04:25.68]I don't know if you should do that.
[04:27.46]That's kind of like a bad idea, don't you think?
[04:31.04]No, that's all right.
[04:31.78]It's all right.
[04:32.14]It's fine.
[04:36.01]talk all this shit on stream but it's all good everything's good everything's gravy let's continue with what we were doing everything you do is a bad idea wait no no no don't spin it like that you better not be spinning it like that
[05:05.10]This is my shit.
[05:05.70]Did my sensitivity reset?
[05:08.16]You can't even hear the goddamn audio.
[05:15.43]There we go.
[05:18.45]But again, yes.
[05:20.81]There was never any, like, hatred between the two of us.
[05:26.57]There was a couple of small disagreements.
[05:29.65]But we still talked.
[05:31.69]We were still friends.
[05:34.93]We just both decided we were going to do completely different things.
[05:38.40]Right?
[05:38.60]I want to make some money first.
[05:42.82]Before we do the bunker, I want to make some money.
[05:52.07]Necessary extra bathroom.
[05:53.21]Let's do this.
[05:54.63]Good morning.
[05:55.01]I bought a big house in which the second bathroom is desperately needed.
[05:58.79]I realize this only after a week of living here and I cannot stand it anymore.
[06:02.91]There's a room next to the kitchen that is perfect for a bathroom and probably even has an appropriate connection.
[06:07.51]Oh.
[06:08.57]You'll also need to paint the walls in the bedrooms.
[06:11.67]Okay.
[06:12.67]Move the bathroom.
[06:13.43]Yeah, we're doing House Flipper again.
[06:16.03]We have a bunker to build.
[06:17.40]And I'm gonna get so into it, you and I have no idea.
[06:26.58]Actually, while we were going over... Actually, here's some insight to funny streams, right?
[06:31.84]While I aimlessly walk around this house, I'll tell you some of the ideas we had.
[06:37.66]We didn't want to get, like, my channel banned from Twitch.
[06:41.86]But one of the funny things we were thinking about doing was when he came in through the window and sat down to play.
[06:49.51]That had a different story originally.
[06:52.70]Originally, we were thinking about how funny would it be if like, oh, a burglar's in my house.
[06:56.14]And I like took like the end of a vase or like the end of a lamp and like behind it, like knocked him out, like knocked him unconscious while he was playing.
[07:04.18]And like, I got the burglar.
[07:05.40]I got him.
[07:06.26]And like, I take his mask off and it's him.
[07:08.04]And it's like, oh, wait, what?
[07:11.30]And he just doesn't wake up.
[07:13.11]And the rest of the stream is me like getting him out of the house and like dragging him out of the room and stuff.
[07:21.63]But we figured we couldn't do that, so that was one of the alternative endings.
[07:28.08]And then he just doesn't stream for like a month.
[07:35.68]uh one of the other scenarios was we were gonna he was I hate to like break up all these interesting stream ideas but he was gonna come over here and we were gonna rekindle our friendship in quotes and the whole point of the stream was hey you're coming over we're gonna rekindle our friendship but we both didn't realize we were both trying to kill each other the whole stream
[07:59.10]So, like, I was going to bring out a vial of poison and put it in his drink.
[08:02.32]He was going to bring out a vial of poison and put it in my drink when we weren't looking.
[08:05.72]And we were going to do, like, the cup switch.
[08:08.70]And we were both going to forget, like, which one was poisoned.
[08:10.68]But the joke was they're both poisoned.
[08:12.42]We were going to do it for, like, the whole stream.
[08:14.18]We were going to have two glasses in front of us switching between them as we did different tasks.
[08:18.23]He was going to, like, spit in my mouth.
[08:20.45]Like, there was a lot of things that we didn't do.
[08:25.59]But let me, like, play this game now.
[08:30.00]All the things we wanted to do, we turned out we probably couldn't do them on Twitch.
[08:34.45]Hmm.
[08:35.83]Oh, pretending to try to murder your friend is probably not a good thing to do on camera.
[08:42.75]Alright, let's modify the walls.
[08:44.49]So we need to do... What did he want?
[08:47.63]He wanted to... He wanted to change the bathroom, right?
[08:51.88]So where's this bathroom?
[08:56.60]Probably should have, like, paid way more attention than give you director's cuts.
[09:02.46]Alright, paint this.
[09:03.02]I gotta paint this room.
[09:04.02]Lay wall tiles, modify the walls.
[09:05.68]Alright, so this thing has to come... This has to come down then, right?
[09:12.33]If he didn't mean mouth... No, I didn't... He was gonna... He was gonna eat, like, a bag of Skittles before he came over the house.
[09:19.45]And I was going to get up to go do something and he was going to drop this disgusting Skittles spit in view of the camera into my drink.
[09:27.96]And for the sake of the comedy, I was going to sit back down and I was going to drink it.
[09:35.50]And be like, oh wow, something weird about that one.
[09:40.81]But we decided against all these things.
[09:52.60]You're one sick individual.
[09:55.04]Am I, though?
[09:56.92]Do you really think that?
[09:57.70]Alright, should I just delete this now?
[10:10.65]We're trying to make money to be able to go.
[10:12.94]Actually, I have $50,000.
[10:13.54]I don't even need to do this.
[10:20.24]Fuck this guy's entire renovation.
[10:21.82]I'm out of here.
[10:26.36]Let's just go to the bunker.
[10:27.16]I don't even have to do that.
[10:27.96]I didn't realize I had $50,000 still.
[10:31.12]Let's go to the bunker.
[10:37.57]Right here.
[10:37.89]Garage with bunker.
[10:38.75]This is where we left off.
[10:40.31]At Uncle's bunker.
[10:45.21]I just smashed his wall and left.
[10:46.25]Well, he can deal with it.
[10:48.33]Look, he didn't even have to pay me.
[10:50.29]Think about that.
[10:50.81]Think of the scenario you just witnessed.
[10:52.59]That guy doesn't have to pay me any money.
[10:54.31]He wanted me to come in and do demo on his house and take away the door, build some new walls, and change the bathroom.
[11:00.41]But I went in there, did like 5% of the demo, and left.
[11:04.11]He didn't even have to pay me any money.
[11:06.38]I just did that for free.
[11:10.02]Yeah, I disposed of his door, and I disposed of his wall, and then I fucking left.
[11:20.98]So, here's the thing.
[11:23.54]This is all underground.
[11:26.08]And because this is all cement, can I do anything with this shit?
[11:33.46]Can I break these walls down?
[11:37.69]I'm so glad that this poster is here.
[11:42.05]Pizza.
[11:43.05]Get rid of the pizza.
[11:43.91]Get rid of that.
[11:44.41]Get rid of this.
[11:44.97]Pick up the cans.
[11:45.57]What is it?
[11:46.13]Can of dry?
[11:48.07]It's really important to know what brand this is.
[11:55.78]Pizza party?
[11:56.32]Yep.
[11:57.92]Welcome to the pizza party.
[12:01.64]Please play Minecraft with Star.
[12:06.03]Why would we do that?
[12:09.47]There's no reason to play Minecraft.
[12:12.67]Uh, let's get the bike out of here.
[12:15.91]Oh, this is kind of a set- Wait a minute.
[12:17.23]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[12:18.31]I get the car, too.
[12:21.81]Why do I get the car?
[12:22.81]Can I sell the car?
[12:27.45]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[12:31.01]When did I buy a car?
[12:34.88]This is free 2300 bucks.
[12:35.66]Should I just keep the car here?
[12:37.46]Alright, I'm gonna bring the car downstairs.
[12:46.90]This is gonna be the centerpiece of the downstairs.
[12:49.64]Okay, we're gonna turn this into a mall.
[12:51.80]You think I'm fucking around?
[12:56.59]I'm going to have a giant room down here that's going to be a couple of stores.
[13:01.01]And it's going to be the car in the center like every mall.
[13:08.60]Yeah, this can't happen yet.
[13:10.66]Hopefully that just... Wait, wait, wait.
[13:12.06]I'm thinking way too far ahead.
[13:13.22]Have you guys ever heard of an underground mall before?
[13:16.25]I haven't.
[13:17.55]I think this is pretty revolutionary stuff I'm working with here.
[13:23.39]Alright, all this stuff has to go.
[13:24.63]This is all junk.
[13:29.81]There's quite a lot of underground malls.
[13:32.25]When have you ever been to a mall that was in an underground bunker?
[13:41.38]Nobody goes to a mall that's in an underground bunker.
[13:44.82]Right now.
[13:45.30]Well, we haven't made it yet.
[13:46.26]We have to make it first.
[13:47.04]Alright.
[13:50.00]My compulsion is driving me crazy.
[13:51.88]Corner to corner here.
[13:52.72]We have to clean the place up.
[13:53.66]Corner to corner.
[13:55.48]So let's start over here.
[13:57.57]This is not a corner.
[13:58.25]It's out of the bike.
[13:59.09]Nobody cares about a bike.
[14:01.83]I care about the bike.
[14:02.41]We're keeping the bike.
[14:05.01]We're going to move this stuff out of the way for a minute.
[14:10.37]Fuck, this car is in the way.
[14:11.87]There's too many cars in the way.
[14:15.72]No, there's only one car in the way, but I can't get rid of it.
[14:21.12]No, this is important to keep this here.
[14:23.94]We have to bring that downstairs.
[14:25.04]Clean around the car.
[14:25.80]I'll be fine.
[14:30.40]Okay, corner to corner.
[14:34.18]Dispose, dispose, dispose, dispose, dispose, dispose, dispose.
[14:37.11]Alright.
[14:41.21]What's over here?
[14:42.27]Any more trash?
[14:46.97]Alright.
[14:47.89]Where's the next... Nope.
[14:55.03]There it is.
[14:55.47]Okay.
[14:56.69]Now this is dirt.
[14:59.84]Because these are actual tires.
[15:04.48]Do I sell these... 7 bucks each?
[15:07.34]That's not... That's bullshit.
[15:08.72]Tires are like $300 each.
[15:09.88]Okay.
[15:14.42]Let's see.
[15:14.87]I think that's it.
[15:17.35]Clean up the... Clean up the base here.
[15:20.93]Spit shine the bike.
[15:25.49]There's a bathroom up here.
[15:27.83]There's plumbing for a bath... What is in the corner?
[15:30.80]Well, just junk.
[15:33.98]Forget it.
[15:34.34]Alright, corner to corner.
[15:38.36]I'll turn it down.
[15:38.85]My sensitivity is far too high.
[15:42.19]Turn it down.
[15:43.61]Turn it down to .26.
[15:43.99].25.
[15:44.01].25.
[15:44.03]Aimbot?
[15:44.19]Remember the mini-map?
[15:44.79]Oh yeah, I know.
[15:45.19]I feel you.
[15:58.62]So what do I want to do?
[15:59.38]This is going to be a mall, which it's not going to be.
[16:01.44]I'm going to change my mind in about 35 seconds.
[16:04.76]Don't you guys know?
[16:07.20]We come up with an idea here, and then I start it, and then something else happens.
[16:11.26]Something will completely throw this off, and it'll turn into something else, and then it'll be like, we'll talk about that for the rest of the stream.
[16:18.93]So what did I say?
[16:19.51]I wanted this to be an underground mall.
[16:21.31]Okay.
[16:22.33]See you in 30 minutes when it's a daycare for dogs.
[16:28.42]Get rid of this.
[16:35.22]I don't want any of this stuff.
[16:38.32]We're clearing this whole thing out.
[16:39.32]Actually, maybe... No, I don't want it.
[16:45.74]I don't want any shovels either.
[16:54.69]Talk about precision.
[16:56.01]Imagine those were all headshots right there.
[17:00.24]It was 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3.
[17:00.72]Alright, what do we got?
[17:03.62]Old couch.
[17:04.24]Let's see if I- Okay, I'm gonna try it.
[17:06.68]I'm gonna go for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 without missing a beat.
[17:11.00]7, 8.
[17:11.84]Ready?
[17:14.28]Oh, that wasn't close enough.
[17:15.16]Hold on.
[17:18.12]Okay, then he's not on a pro team yet.
[17:19.85]He's not on a pro FPS team yet.
[17:22.71]Don't ask me how that's possible.
[17:27.51]Look at all this shit.
[17:28.09]Wanna see precision fucking tool deletion here?
[17:38.36]He just doesn't stop.
[17:41.34]One, two, three.
[17:42.58]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[17:48.90]Why is this impressive?
[17:50.72]This is not impressive.
[17:55.75]Clean the goddamn window.
[18:01.57]Someone stop this guy.
[18:04.29]No, don't fuck around.
[18:05.31]I don't want to sell the car.
[18:06.39]Car is important.
[18:07.88]Get out of here, get out of here, get out of here.
[18:16.82]This guy's balls to the walls.
[18:19.60]Can I delete the door?
[18:20.78]No.
[18:22.53]All right, now there's enough room.
[18:23.45]I don't want to get the TV.
[18:24.49]There's already a TV and a TV stand here.
[18:26.77]I don't have to buy it.
[18:29.89]Oh, what a disaster it is in here.
[18:31.63]Oh, oh.
[18:34.62]Hey, you guys want to know one of my tics that I have as like a person?
[18:38.36]Have you noticed that right when I'm about to say something, or right when I'm about to start talking about something that I think is interesting, I go, you'll pick up on it.
[18:51.51]Oh, let me tell you this.
[18:53.21]Oh!
[18:53.31]There's already a toilet in here too.
[19:01.49]How long have I been streaming for?
[19:04.14]You are very early.
[19:05.28]19 minutes and 42 seconds.
[19:10.32]Why would this be in the bathroom?
[19:16.20]God damn it, I tried to do it fast.
[19:17.44]All right, let's get rid of this ugly sink.
[19:20.06]Keep the shelf, though.
[19:22.22]Quick, stick a fork in it!
[19:23.04]I don't know why I said that.
[19:26.97]I'm sorry.
[19:27.43]Can I clean the toilet?
[19:36.08]This is fine.
[19:40.07]Unclean?
[19:40.87]The toilet's fine.
[19:43.43]Is the toilet not clean?
[19:46.53]It's kind of dirty.
[19:48.49]There are some old piss stains in there, aren't there?
[19:57.87]Let's see.
[20:05.21]I can't like take it, I don't want an outlet here.
[20:13.88]I can't delete it, can I?
[20:14.76]What, am I gonna charge my iPhone over here?
[20:21.31]No, not a literal fork.
[20:24.13]This thing was making too much noise, so like put a sock in it, you know what I mean?
[20:27.03]Put a sock in it, man.
[20:27.95]You're making too much noise, too much electrical interference.
[20:38.41]All right, let me put one of these on.
[20:39.94]Radiator.
[20:42.72]That's good.
[20:51.38]Yeah, what did happen to the music?
[20:52.44]It kind of just turned off.
[21:00.05]All right.
[21:00.91]Oh, that's good there.
[21:01.99]Window's clean.
[21:02.69]I kind of want to get rid of these, but I don't want to.
[21:08.80]This floor's gotta go, and this car has to go, too.
[21:11.10]Can I break... Wait a minute.
[21:13.74]Okay, hold on.
[21:16.20]We need... Do I really want this to be a bathroom, though?
[21:19.53]I feel like this is a terrible... Is there a bathroom downstairs?
[21:21.85]Let me see.
[21:26.09]I mean, this is a spot right here for a bed.
[21:29.13]That's a bedroom right there.
[21:36.80]Okay, here's a bathroom here.
[21:41.46]this goes up to the backyard can I build walls here no that's the one thing that I don't like about this game is you can't just build walls and freely make rooms what do I I have what what is that what word are you guys saying what does that mean
[22:08.98]I'm not going to say that out loud because I think it's a joke here.
[22:11.42]What is it?
[22:14.58]I'm not going to say it.
[22:16.29]Why would I say that?
[22:21.01]This is why I don't just say things out loud.
[22:23.41]I need to know I'm not going to do that.
[22:32.82]Why can I not put the car in the driveway?
[22:36.06]Why does it have to be inside the house?
[22:41.27]Nah, I'm not gonna say it.
[22:45.75]Alright, so there is a bathroom downstairs, therefore... I guess it's okay to have two bathrooms.
[22:51.34]But do I really want that, though?
[22:57.03]Maybe not.
[23:01.61]Hmm... Should this be a two-bath?
[23:07.19]Should I turn this into a... No, let's... I want to start down before I go up.
[23:12.05]Because I'll get inspiration down here.
[23:15.61]You know what I'm saying?
[23:17.93]I don't know what, like, Uncle kept down here, but apparently he used to, like, boil snakes.
[23:21.61]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[23:23.19]Those are pickles.
[23:26.31]I don't know.
[23:26.67]It's, like, down in a bunker.
[23:27.99]I don't know what the hell could be down here.
[23:29.59]This could be, like, pickled people.
[23:33.86]Is it corn?
[23:42.71]This is the bathroom.
[23:43.86]This is gonna be the bedroom.
[23:48.44]Can I put a door here?
[23:51.90]This is not enough for a bed.
[23:52.90]Can a bed go right here?
[23:55.34]I wonder.
[23:59.48]Can I put a bed there?
[24:07.45]Yes, I can.
[24:12.07]What?
[24:14.09]No, this whole place can't be.
[24:15.71]It's all cement.
[24:16.47]I can't do anything about this.
[24:17.45]I can't even bring a wall down.
[24:18.63]Oh, this place sucks.
[24:21.74]What am I supposed to do about this?
[24:27.14]Can I even break the stairs?
[24:30.00]How am I supposed to sell this place?
[24:32.80]It's all cement.
[24:40.21]Okay, should I just clean it up and list it?
[24:47.04]All right, let's clean this place up and list it.
[24:51.63]Because apparently I can't do anything with the walls down here.
[24:55.61]I bought a bunker.
[24:56.29]What did I expect?
[24:57.01]I expected to be able to upgrade the bunker and do various things to said bunker.
[25:01.37]All right, forget it.
[25:03.12]We're just going to clean it up.
[25:07.06]But I do want something here, though.
[25:14.97]I can't even put a curtain here.
[25:16.09]I want to just put a curtain there.
[25:19.33]I can go like pee over here.
[25:21.25]It's cement.
[25:21.73]It's not going to be a problem.
[25:22.73]Okay.
[25:26.80]I can't even give myself a privacy curtain.
[25:28.60]That's bullshit.
[25:36.74]No, forget it.
[25:37.36]Let's just clean.
[25:37.80]Let's clean it up.
[25:39.70]Let's do that first.
[25:47.76]Watch out for the bugs.
[25:48.40]Yeah, I know I can disable bugs in the vacuum cleaner, don't I?
[25:58.93]This is really like such a dumb way to get rid of bugs.
[26:03.25]You never want to do that.
[26:08.58]That doesn't solve anything.
[26:09.76]You know what that does?
[26:10.46]That breaks your vacuum cleaner.
[26:18.99]Well, it looks like we got a bug problem.
[26:21.83]Oh, now I have a vacuum cleaner problem, too.
[26:24.61]Because this shit don't work no more.
[26:28.04]It's clogged with dead insect bodies.
[26:34.80]Alright, I can sell all these random things.
[26:38.64]Can't I?
[26:39.36]Yeah.
[26:41.65]I just sold the trash, apparently.
[26:46.42]I know this is supposed to be a bunker and we're supposed to roleplay and play along here and... No, I don't care.
[26:52.46]I don't care about the canned ham and the peanut butter.
[26:58.04]Somebody would leave all this shit and make an actual bunker here.
[27:12.83]That was pretty good.
[27:17.52]Do an RP bit for this.
[27:19.86]What do you want me to RP?
[27:23.55]Well, somebody gave a lot of money.
[27:26.17]Thank you, Based Grandpa, for the $50.
[27:28.27]And they say, say it.
[27:32.09]Say it.
[27:32.81]Thank you, $50, dude.
[27:34.33]Based Grandpa.
[27:36.85]What do you want me to say?
[27:40.33]Now, this is some new thing that everybody all of a sudden now thinks is funny, right?
[27:47.12]What is it, though?
[27:52.08]You ain't gonna get shit from me.
[27:53.60]I ain't gonna say bad words on stream.
[28:00.15]Say, up, dog.
[28:03.13]Okay, I can say that because that's a joke that your great-grandfather fell for and then beat the guy up that told it to him because he thought he was a witch.
[28:12.03]So, I'm alright with that one.
[28:26.66]It kind of smells like UpGamer in here.
[28:30.87]What's UpGamer?
[28:31.85]That's so... That is so... Come on.
[28:39.81]Okay.
[28:42.99]Let's flip this place.
[28:44.37]I'm going to buy the most expensive house in the game and we're going to turn it into a goddamn arcade.
[28:51.53]Buy a shower.
[28:52.09]I got lots of money anyways, so...
[29:02.92]Why is everybody giving me the HA treatment?
[29:05.94]Oh, by the way, if you haven't voted, make sure you vote for the emotes.
[29:09.52]Community emote contest is currently going on.
[29:12.29]I highly suggest you go here and give yourself, give your opinion.
[29:19.67]Emote contest.
[29:22.01]Community emotes.
[29:23.67]Pick five, please.
[29:27.85]What am I missing here?
[29:28.75]Oh, this thing.
[29:30.74]Screw it in.
[29:32.16]Tight, tight, tight, tight, tight.
[29:37.85]You're confused, so am I. But don't worry.
[29:42.07]This ain't my first rodeo, as they say.
[29:44.57]Chad periodically tries to get the streamer to say something.
[29:48.85]And then they all clip it.
[29:52.29]And then they all share it in their group.
[29:57.45]I've seen it before.
[30:07.01]That's that's what it is.
[30:08.23]It's that that's what it is Really oh Come on Why today though why is that a thing people are doing today what happened yesterday?
[30:25.06]Oh?
[30:36.71]Uh, these up here.
[30:40.65]Shower's the worst, because shower takes the most time.
[30:48.57]Because I want you to do it.
[30:50.25]You know, I'd rather just say the thing that I'm supposed to be saying as the joke, just say it out loud.
[31:00.23]But I'm not going to do that, because that's rude.
[31:01.83]That's crude.
[31:02.92]That's rude.
[31:06.07]And I'm not that guy.
[31:07.11]I'm not going to be profane.
[31:10.23]Why would I do that?
[31:10.83]I always do that opposite every time.
[31:23.29]I can't be helped, seriously.
[31:31.32]Screw that in.
[31:33.82]Bingo.
[31:35.79]Screw this in.
[31:44.56]Is this by the people that made my summer car?
[31:48.92]I don't think so.
[31:50.60]I'm pretty sure this is somebody else entirely here.
[31:55.52]All right, so we got a bathroom.
[31:57.63]This has the tiling on here.
[31:59.23]This all has to change.
[32:00.05]This looks terrible.
[32:03.19]But no, I said I was just going to flip it, right?
[32:05.97]Should I try to flip it empty?
[32:13.33]I wonder if I should flip this empty.
[32:17.29]Another $50.
[32:18.57]Thank you, Multitrip, for the 50 bucks.
[32:21.43]Germans want to let you know how happy I am that you and Star are talking again.
[32:24.09]I watched your guys' videos so much in high school.
[32:25.77]I've been following you for... I missed what the last part was.
[32:32.12]I'm following you, building your Twitch channels, and it's been such a fun ride.
[32:35.10]It would be great if you guys would play... Is somebody trying to get me to say something here?
[32:45.28]This is... S-U-G-O-N.
[32:49.09]I'm not saying it.
[32:49.91]Nope.
[32:50.39]You almost got it.
[32:51.37]But thank you for the 50 bucks.
[32:52.89]Together with viewers someday.
[32:56.21]Nope.
[32:57.93]Almost.
[32:58.49]It was close.
[33:05.74]No, of course.
[33:07.26]Thank you, Multitrip, so much for your 50 bucks here, dude.
[33:14.97]Of course, it's always good to rekindle with people that you've lost potential, you know.
[33:20.95]Lost potential kindling.
[33:23.87]Why is this doing this?
[33:25.87]What's happening here?
[33:26.97]Why is it alt-tabbing me?
[33:31.10]Oh, this is bad.
[33:31.72]I gotta, like, restart the game.
[33:35.00]Back to office.
[33:37.61]I have to restart the game.
[33:40.03]Apparently, when I pressed the Windows key, the game decided it hated me and didn't want me.
[33:43.53]Okay, there we go.
[33:44.25]Is that alright now?
[33:44.97]Alright, we're good.
[33:54.02]And again, to reiterate, there was no actual real bad blood between the two of us.
[34:00.42]We just both...
[34:02.34]Let's just be real.
[34:03.22]Let's just be real about the whole situation.
[34:04.66]We both just didn't give a shit about what the other person was currently doing.
[34:08.15]Right?
[34:10.21]That's just the way it is.
[34:13.53]Like... We just... Our interests were not even remotely connected anymore.
[34:25.54]But... That's fine.
[34:34.36]Alright, so everything's clean, right?
[34:35.62]Except for those cobwebs in the corner.
[34:39.49]Are you implying that you give a shit now?
[34:42.37]Well... No, but... Alright, remember.
[34:47.37]Just because... Just because you don't necessarily care about what's the interests of the other friend or the other person doesn't mean that you just will never talk to him ever again.
[35:00.12]And we did want to make it very clear that just because we just don't really do much anymore, that we're not like mortal fucking enemies.
[35:13.75]Uh, sink.
[35:18.16]Another shower?
[35:18.70]Should I have two showers?
[35:28.21]But no, I mean, I would expect... Before he left, we talked about... Before we left the water park in a blow-up argument, we talked about playing games and doing streams and just the right time, right moment.
[35:45.01]Obviously, we're both very busy.
[35:46.81]We both have a lot of shit to do over the next few months, so... Alright, I need to... I hate this bunker.
[35:57.35]Put a toilet.
[35:57.97]Let's put an expensive toilet down here.
[36:00.09]The music is magically back as well.
[36:01.63]Alright, this is a... What am I just... Okay, here.
[36:07.80]Here you go.
[36:10.20]Just, like, squat down and shit down that hole.
[36:14.24]And then wipe your ass and stuff it in.
[36:20.73]Put a sink.
[36:39.72]Just put more toilet paper down.
[36:41.10]Should I just cover the ground in toilet paper?
[36:44.14]Well, hold on.
[36:44.72]It is a bunker.
[36:47.32]Wouldn't a bunker be one of those situations where... There's no plumbing down here.
[36:54.03]When does they ever have plumbing in a bunker?
[36:57.91]This is an expensive bunker.
[37:07.20]Connect that.
[37:08.92]Close it up.
[37:10.85]Ding dong.
[37:14.67]Play with death grips instead on the background.
[37:18.66]I want to play relaxing music.
[37:27.72]Can I buy a bunch of these?
[37:28.74]Is there a way I can buy volume here?
[37:43.05]Yeah, that's better.
[37:48.63]No shout.
[37:49.33]I mean, it's just gonna increase the property value.
[37:51.79]Might as well just do the damn thing.
[37:55.76]125 bucks.
[37:56.18]I'm increasing the value of the property by like 5 to 10 grand.
[38:02.40]Death Crips is relaxing.
[38:05.36]Is it though?
[38:08.68]Okay, I've never heard Death Grips before, but just the name itself makes me think of... You know what I mean?
[38:18.62]Is it that kind of music?
[38:23.97]I'm not going to end up hearing that, right?
[38:29.99]Everyone's confused.
[38:32.10]When you can't understand a word they're saying, it just sounds like they're saying vowels.
[38:46.98]Is it one of those bands?
[38:55.91]Every time I hear one of those bands, I just think of Cookie Monster telling me how to spell words and shit.
[39:05.96]Is it one of those death metal bands?
[39:18.43]No, it's not.
[39:25.75]So it's not like that like... When I hear like death grip, that's what I think of.
[39:47.66]So it's like a rap group.
[39:49.46]Alright, whatever.
[39:49.96]That's cool.
[39:53.26]I'm clicking on the wrong thing over and over again.
[40:01.03]It's an experimental rap band.
[40:02.59]Oh, okay.
[40:05.11]Well, think of the name, right?
[40:05.99]Like Death Grips.
[40:06.91]Like Cannibal Corpse.
[40:11.59]When you put death in the name of your band, usually it means that you...
[40:16.89]You're doing vowels, potentially.
[40:35.96]Deaf leopard, what?
[40:41.04]Who eats cor- no, that's the name of the band!
[40:55.26]Put on throat singing.
[40:56.26]Alright, this place is all cleaned up.
[40:58.10]It's got everything connected.
[40:58.84]I think we gotta put the car... I wish I could build out.
[41:02.40]I just can't though.
[41:05.42]How much did I spend on this place when I'm just wasting my money?
[41:13.96]I wonder what happens if I let... No, I gotta put like a bedroom down here.
[41:16.53]I have to do something.
[41:21.37]Oh, this place sucks.
[41:22.89]This place is terrible.
[41:25.55]I have to at least... No, I gotta try.
[41:27.25]I have to try to make my money back.
[41:29.97]We have to put a toilet here.
[41:30.97]What do these people want?
[41:34.44]How can I, like, see what they want?
[41:38.76]Is there a way for me to see that?
[41:39.96]Buyers.
[41:42.26]Uh, there's no family room.
[41:43.66]Alright, we're gonna cater to one person here.
[41:50.11]We need a place for books.
[41:52.75]I like that there's only one bedroom.
[41:55.21]I like that I have a place to sleep.
[41:57.43]I like that my books will be on the shelves.
[42:01.45]Okay, so he likes the fact that he has a place to go to bed in here.
[42:05.61]So bedroom.
[42:07.53]I want a bedroom in my house, but only one.
[42:10.75]I need books.
[42:12.38]The place to study should be near where I sleep.
[42:14.52]Easy.
[42:15.50]This guy wants one fucking bedroom and a ton of bookshelves.
[42:19.04]You got it.
[42:22.73]So down here, here it is.
[42:24.94]This is where it's going to be.
[42:28.14]Bedroom.
[42:34.14]Bookshelf.
[42:38.86]Office, bookshelf.
[42:39.56]Just buy like three of them.
[42:40.76]It doesn't matter.
[42:41.34]That's going to make him happy.
[42:50.58]Wait, no, no, hold on.
[42:52.20]It's this... You know, I'm not going to live here.
[42:54.14]Hold on, wait.
[42:54.74]It's the guy with the gas mask.
[43:04.50]Look at this shit.
[43:07.88]What about this lady?
[43:12.65]Hold on, wait, what?
[43:16.45]She wants a house with a bunker, allowing her to survive a nuclear explosion by at least half a year.
[43:24.62]Okay.
[43:27.26]And you currently live in Florida.
[43:29.52]I live in Florida, but you know, I'm really concerned about a nuke going off, so... This guy lives in Massachusetts.
[43:44.04]Who else is left here?
[43:45.68]It's that guy with the hat.
[43:48.27]At zero hour, those who are unprepared will be like zombies.
[43:51.41]They will kill to survive.
[43:52.95]I want to be ready for it.
[43:56.53]Alright, so we just need a bed.
[43:57.87]I'm just going to put... I don't know.
[44:01.58]Whatever.
[44:02.06]Put a bed in here.
[44:02.90]I don't like any of these clients, to be honest with you.
[44:10.10]Put a double bed in here.
[44:16.43]Can't even be on the vent.
[44:17.35]Whatever.
[44:18.38]That guy doesn't like it, but he does.
[44:19.82]One bed?
[44:20.28]Where's the second one?
[44:21.00]He wants two beds.
[44:22.88]One bed, okay.
[44:23.54]Alright, we're going to cater to the guy with the hat.
[44:27.54]How am I supposed to put more than one bed here?
[44:31.12]I want to bring the car with me, too.
[44:32.26]Alright, hold on.
[44:32.64]Let's get a bed in here.
[44:34.10]Let's go up here.
[44:35.14]Put a bed in here.
[44:39.30]See, I don't even care about how this place looks.
[44:41.20]I'm just manipulating these people.
[44:42.43]Alright, let's see.
[44:46.14]Give me some... Give me some feedback here.
[44:49.56]Come on, guys.
[44:55.35]No feedback?
[44:57.87]People care about books and that's pretty much it.
[45:01.19]What about a desk?
[45:09.26]Come on.
[45:09.80]There's two beds here now.
[45:10.82]Sofa.
[45:17.75]Give me some feedback.
[45:22.89]Oh, wait a minute.
[45:23.37]Hold on.
[45:25.19]They want this place for... He wants it for the zombie apocalypse.
[45:28.29]What about a bunch of guns?
[45:30.10]And, like, weapons and shit.
[45:31.94]Survival.
[45:32.40]Here we go.
[45:35.14]Alright.
[45:46.93]Do you think the zombie apocalypse is why you want this, right?
[45:50.21]Gas mask.
[45:51.61]Just, like, put it on the table.
[45:56.41]Why can I not put this down?
[45:59.01]First aid kit.
[46:05.21]A knife.
[46:12.08]Your hat that you currently have on.
[46:18.10]They want it in the bunker.
[46:21.11]No, this is the bunker, though.
[46:27.91]By the way, I think there's something illegal about selling a place with just weapons in it.
[46:32.35]What about a bunk bed right here?
[46:35.03]Shit.
[46:38.82]Aim and fire.
[46:39.46]That guy likes it.
[46:42.06]He does?
[46:42.40]Okay, good.
[46:50.95]They like the guns.
[46:55.26]I guess the more weapons down here, the better.
[46:56.78]So let's do a generator.
[46:58.52]That's a lot of money, though.
[47:03.53]Where am I going to put this?
[47:07.81]This place sucks.
[47:09.69]But I don't care.
[47:22.71]Just do gun wallpaper.
[47:26.51]These things are expensive.
[47:27.49]I can't do this anymore.
[47:28.55]Only like another three of these.
[47:34.05]Survival.
[47:36.76]Canned food.
[47:39.96]There we go.
[47:41.08]Where is the food?
[47:42.50]We need food supplies.
[47:43.58]Got it.
[47:47.64]Cans of tuna.
[47:52.15]There's not one can.
[47:53.89]What will I eat?
[47:54.61]There's not enough food to survive a week.
[47:56.43]How much fucking food do you want?
[48:05.52]We will survive.
[48:06.36]It's a pity that only for a week.
[48:10.62]Why is this my responsibility, though?
[48:12.55]You understand?
[48:13.15]Like, I'm not supposed to stalk your bunker.
[48:15.39]I'm selling you property.
[48:21.26]Put a fridge down here?
[48:22.32]Yeah, but I have to stock the fridge.
[48:24.08]What about pickled jar of soup?
[48:29.46]Yeah, take your McDonald's pink slime and make your own nuggets.
[48:31.90]I have water.
[48:43.55]Gas.
[48:46.77]What do you think about the gas?
[48:51.25]I don't think they're too keen on the gas here.
[48:54.65]Eat gas.
[48:56.35]Food container.
[48:57.13]There you go.
[49:01.77]Now there will be enough energy.
[49:03.00]There's enough food for just a short time.
[49:10.88]This is a joke.
[49:12.50]This is actually just a joke.
[49:16.50]How many cans of schlop do you need?
[49:26.74]Is anything in that container?
[49:30.06]It's not much, but maybe I'll survive.
[49:31.70]Alright, what other survival things do you want?
[49:33.66]Large food container.
[49:36.12]How is a large food container smaller than the actual food container?
[49:48.12]Look.
[49:49.82]This one's bigger.
[49:53.00]It's not much, but maybe we'll survive.
[49:54.90]Getting closer.
[49:58.43]I need to put a generator down here, though.
[49:59.83]I really do.
[50:03.89]Where's the other generator?
[50:05.13]Turbine power generator.
[50:08.88]They're gonna like that, right?
[50:09.72]That's a lot of money.
[50:18.52]What's in those containers?
[50:21.28]Probably soybeans and water.
[50:24.74]If I had to take a guess.
[50:27.83]I need more fucking food than this shit.
[50:32.49]Plastic barrel, rice, first aid.
[50:35.78]There we go.
[50:40.48]They like the first aid.
[50:45.44]I actually have to just make a shitload of this, don't I?
[50:50.40]Where can I put the gas mask?
[50:59.06]Do I need to hang this somewhere?
[51:00.30]I don't understand.
[51:04.72]On your face.
[51:07.66]Where's the shelf upstairs?
[51:09.08]There's so much food in the way.
[51:12.89]Alright, guns.
[51:17.23]Here we go.
[51:17.71]Where's that shelf in here?
[51:20.23]Okay, I can't... There we go.
[51:28.50]They're not happy about that.
[51:33.96]Gotta get the rad reset.
[51:35.92]Rad resist.
[51:38.47]Okay.
[51:40.19]I'm just about done with this.
[51:43.65]More large food containers.
[51:45.47]I'm selling it.
[51:49.84]It's not much.
[51:51.16]They want more than this.
[51:53.84]How am I supposed to put this?
[52:01.32]It's not much.
[52:03.48]Maybe we'll survive a week.
[52:04.96]Are you kidding me?
[52:06.69]There's enough food here to last at least six months.
[52:15.63]Now what else do we need?
[52:17.04]There's no water down here, but I'll fix that.
[52:20.76]Water container.
[52:24.94]Without water, I can only survive three days.
[52:30.94]I'll die here without water.
[52:38.16]Alright, I'll die.
[52:39.68]Wait, these are empty.
[52:44.59]More water!
[52:46.07]Water, I need more water!
[52:49.75]It's not so much!
[53:00.02]I better get a lot of money for this.
[53:02.32]Because I'm wasting a lot for no reason.
[53:11.19]More water.
[53:12.33]More water.
[53:17.53]Okay.
[53:18.63]I don't see any more complaints.
[53:21.67]I think that means that they like it.
[53:26.50]Yeah, they like it.
[53:27.30]What about boots?
[53:29.12]You know, you need some galoshes, don't you?
[53:33.08]Oh, I could use boots!
[53:33.86]Thanks for picking me up those boots!
[53:38.09]I think the toilet paper actually was a good idea, because the way they're going to get it.
[53:40.83]You're going to wipe your ass with the same toilet paper or the same roll for six months?
[53:47.05]You're going to have to make it last, man.
[53:54.46]This is the most paranoid room I've ever seen in my life.
[53:57.98]I just imagine the person lying on their back here staring at the ceiling.
[54:01.79]Just holding in all their breath.
[54:09.49]Oh, you know what this reminds me of?
[54:13.71]You ever seen... You ever seen My 600-lb Life on TLC?
[54:22.46]Well, there's just a bed here and this bunch of shit everywhere and they just like eat out of a container.
[54:30.22]That's kind of what this is.
[54:33.26]And they pee in jars and... Cloverfield.
[54:40.35]Okay, I'm about ready to sell.
[54:48.17]Do we need any more food?
[54:49.45]Let's put down some more tuna.
[54:51.31]It's not much.
[54:53.92]Can I please buy denominations of this?
[54:56.02]So I don't have to do this one by one.
[54:59.37]Let's have more volume.
[55:11.03]Tuna fish or canned meat?
[55:18.97]Okay, yep, they're happy.
[55:20.91]What else do they need here?
[55:22.77]Probably like tools, a shovel.
[55:27.90]Pickle jars, pickle jars.
[55:31.22]No, they don't need any pickle jars.
[55:33.34]I don't know what's even in there.
[55:34.38]There you go.
[55:34.96]More water.
[55:35.66]What do you mean more water?
[55:36.91]Is this water in here?
[55:46.89]There's nowhere else to put anything.
[55:50.39]I should have made a bunch of shelves.
[55:51.90]I blew this so bad.
[55:57.76]Look, all I need to do is sell it.
[55:58.80]I don't need to care about space-wise.
[56:04.22]First aid.
[56:04.68]Do another first aid.
[56:05.52]How am I going to get out?
[56:07.77]By pressing enter.
[56:13.63]Gas.
[56:14.23]Let's do another thing of gas.
[56:17.56]Dude, all it's gonna take is for you to be... Don't smoke down here, dude.
[56:21.62]Hopefully you don't have cigarettes in your body.
[56:24.55]Let me just finish off with a nice fresh cigarette.
[56:34.65]Box?
[56:35.00]How about just a box?
[56:37.56]I wish you could store things in box.
[56:39.28]No, there's no more room.
[56:40.70]I gotta get out of here.
[56:45.56]So much for underground mall, right?
[56:51.22]How you gonna cook all this?
[56:52.24]You need this.
[56:54.86]Microwave.
[56:56.16]Yeah, just plug in the microwave, lie down, and place the microwave on your stomach.
[57:00.86]And turn it on.
[57:02.46]And just cook all your food just sitting there on you.
[57:11.47]No, there's already a TV upstairs.
[57:12.87]Why am I doing this?
[57:19.39]Gotta have a fan down here.
[57:22.38]Circulate some of the air.
[57:28.92]Body pillow.
[57:35.51]Alright, I'm gonna really piss these people off.
[57:37.19]You ready?
[57:38.51]This is gonna be unbearable.
[57:41.37]Why?
[57:41.63]Oh, there we go.
[58:00.78]Just in case you run out of these.
[58:01.78]Are there any brighter lights?
[58:07.04]Just the wave, right?
[58:11.49]No, we need a huge bright one.
[58:17.19]There we go.
[58:21.47]My framerate's gonna start to die here in a second.
[58:27.13]Alright, I'm ready to sell.
[58:31.21]This is just somebody's garage.
[58:33.21]This is not even a... Okay, I'm selling.
[58:34.89]Who cares?
[58:41.27]Installations, floor tiles.
[58:43.09]We don't... That guy got mad when I started to put stuff in.
[58:47.61]He was actually upset.
[58:48.55]What about oxygen?
[58:49.37]There's no oxygen down here.
[58:50.47]You need some oxygen.
[58:54.40]You better keep that thing alive or else you ain't gonna be breathing anymore down here.
[59:00.62]Need more oxygen?
[59:01.52]Alright.
[59:01.78]Are there any bigger ones?
[59:14.66]Like, how can you expect to be alive down here?
[59:20.92]Okay.
[59:23.18]Plants can steal the water, but the plants, you need the plants to live.
[59:26.15]Other.
[59:26.81]Other.
[59:30.78]Here, you can plan your escape.
[59:35.62]No, I don't want the hook.
[59:41.01]Store whatever you want in here.
[59:42.11]Alright, this is the worst bunker I've... This is so bad, and this goes against everything I wanted to do.
[59:56.47]But at some point, you just have to kind of just forget it.
[60:01.00]I am going to go sell the car, though.
[60:03.04]Because that's a free... That's actually free money.
[60:06.70]Why would I not get rid of that?
[60:07.68]They're not going to need the car.
[60:13.94]I think they're good.
[60:18.24]Unfortunately, this has got to go.
[60:19.86]I'll take my money back, though.
[60:24.32]Wait, that just pissed him off.
[60:29.09]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[60:30.19]This guy wanted to be able to drive around?
[60:37.52]How was I supposed to know?
[60:38.64]What?
[60:40.54]Alright, it's time.
[60:42.88]I need to take it, just see, sell it.
[60:45.06]$48,000.
[60:45.08]I bought it for $115,000.
[60:47.56]God damn it.
[60:48.68]There's no kitchen.
[60:49.18]Okay, this is fine.
[61:01.54]Two beds are perfect.
[61:02.30]Now we all have to play.
[61:03.14]Rice and pasta should be in here.
[61:04.46]Imagine if you decided where you were going to buy a property and if there was a bunch of rice and pasta in the house.
[61:18.69]Thanks for the $180,000.
[61:19.13]No, no, no, no, no.
[61:25.75]Cancel.
[61:27.17]Just give it to me.
[61:33.38]$229,000.
[61:33.44]Now we can start to build a real house.
[61:35.70]That's a lot of money.
[61:43.11]Let's browse for a house.
[61:44.85]$279,000 is this one.
[61:47.83]This is the family house. $188,000.
[61:56.31]What is this one?
[61:57.77]Un... What is this?
[61:59.57]I can't even read this.
[62:00.45]The house was bought for refurbishment.
[62:03.33]The current owner did not have time to do it, so he is asking for a buyer.
[62:08.73]The price is final and is not negotiable.
[62:14.15]What about my own tiny home?
[62:19.02]I don't... What am I supposed to do about my tiny home?
[62:21.38]I can't build anything here.
[62:23.70]See?
[62:24.08]I can't build it out.
[62:26.18]All I could do is just make this place smaller.
[62:28.44]I could just close it in.
[62:32.73]That place did look like a dad house.
[62:34.15]That's true.
[62:39.70]I'm almost at the most expensive house in the game.
[62:41.40]What do you think?
[62:43.22]What's this one?
[62:44.30]A beautiful house for sale, three bathrooms, and a pool.
[62:52.06]So why do I need to flip this one?
[62:53.94]This one's already in great shape.
[62:55.88]What if I just buy this and immediately sell it?
[62:59.97]What happens?
[63:03.01]What if I just buy it for $180 and then sell it for $200?
[63:05.31]Just clean it.
[63:23.38]I'm gonna mop the floors and then sell this for $40,000 more dollars.
[63:29.38]This place is big, though.
[63:34.12]What the fuck?
[63:38.07]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[63:39.63]Hold on a minute.
[63:40.27]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[63:41.93]Oh my god.
[63:49.59]Whoa, did they catch him?
[63:53.59]I don't think they caught him.
[64:03.04]Do I have to solve the murder?
[64:07.86]This place is huge.
[64:09.28]I think we do have to make this place better.
[64:13.21]This bathroom's already nice.
[64:14.21]We don't have to do anything to this.
[64:15.21]They already did it for me.
[64:19.63]Alright, the struggle started in the back.
[64:20.97]You know, I'm going to clean up the blood and sell it.
[64:22.58]Look at how beautiful this is.
[64:23.76]Everything's so nice already.
[64:29.18]You got it.
[64:31.16]Just bring out the mop, man.
[64:32.40]That's all it's going to take.
[64:34.40]Make sure it's in working order.
[64:35.69]I don't have to screw anything in.
[64:37.03]Just sell it in this condition.
[64:43.73]No, I can make an easy 30 grand right now.
[64:47.24]It's blood on the carpets.
[64:48.48]Is there blood on the ceiling?
[64:49.57]I think it's underneath this.
[64:54.87]Am I getting it?
[65:09.85]Or is it in the room downstairs in that same spot?
[65:13.25]No, okay.
[65:13.81]So where the hell is it?
[65:15.78]That's not the room below.
[65:16.78]The room below changes here.
[65:22.14]What on earth is this room?
[65:27.35]Is this where he brings people to interrogate them?
[65:36.01]Okay, I guess it is down here.
[65:39.41]Maybe not.
[65:47.37]This is like a fucked up house.
[65:51.55]Is there a basement, too?
[65:56.71]This place is too big.
[65:58.17]I hate houses that are this big.
[66:02.79]No, there's no... Is this a secret wall or something?
[66:04.61]No, I don't see a basement.
[66:11.50]I see upstairs.
[66:16.98]It's a nice house, though, regardless.
[66:20.84]Oh, there's a light fixture.
[66:25.87]Oh, that's not blood.
[66:27.41]That's actually a light fixture.
[66:28.89]Alright, let's clean this up.
[66:35.41]That's it.
[66:35.65]That's all I have to do.
[66:36.41]Alright, here we go.
[66:41.14]Start outside.
[66:43.40]Just use the brush and then we're going to flip this thing instantly.
[66:50.72]Uh, light switch.
[66:54.16]There it is.
[66:58.04]Watch your hand here.
[67:05.42]There's a bunch of light fixtures on the couch.
[67:09.72]Why?
[67:12.96]There's not enough blood.
[67:18.69]He's never going to get caught.
[67:21.73]Does this make you an accomplice to crime, by the way?
[67:24.82]Let's just say that somebody called and said, Hey, I know you do a cleaning service and you flip houses and you sell houses.
[67:33.18]You need to come and I need you to do this in my house.
[67:36.87]And I walked in and it was like this.
[67:38.95]And I called them.
[67:39.61]And I was like, hey man, what's going on in the living room here?
[67:45.32]Oh, I cut my finger.
[67:46.28]I was making a salad and I cut my finger.
[67:54.68]And then I called the police.
[67:56.81]And the police come down.
[67:57.83]And they look around and they're like, hmm, okay, yeah, there's a lot of blood over here.
[68:02.87]And then there's a salad over here with a bowl.
[68:05.87]And there's a knife and there's a carrot with blood on it.
[68:10.09]What do we do?
[68:13.09]And they're like, oh, okay, I guess that's what it is.
[68:17.81]And then, okay, so then, like, 30 years later, they find out that the guy murdered somebody in this house.
[68:22.13]Am I still an accomplice to that crime?
[68:30.47]Yes.
[68:31.19]Are you sure?
[68:31.65]I don't think I am.
[68:38.46]You dispose of evidence.
[68:40.00]But I didn't know I was disposing of evidence.
[68:44.21]I thought I was disposing of a... A finger cut.
[68:48.67]And even, like, the police came and they had nothing to go on.
[68:51.39]But I still... I had to clean the house.
[68:53.71]That's what I was paid to do.
[68:57.48]It gets you one month in the chair.
[69:02.30]I don't think you would survive 30 seconds in the chair.
[69:04.78]I don't know if you could do that.
[69:08.56]A month in the chair.
[69:09.72]That doesn't make any sense.
[69:13.32]Alright, we got that cleaned up.
[69:22.34]Okay, everything else looks fine.
[69:24.36]Besides the fixtures.
[69:28.97]They don't turn on the chair.
[69:30.45]You just have to sit in it.
[69:37.63]But what if they have to execute somebody?
[69:40.43]Do you just get out?
[69:41.33]Are you just the seat warmer for executions?
[69:49.73]Yes.
[69:53.91]This music, you can't handle the music?
[69:57.49]What is wrong with this guy?
[69:58.55]The guy that killed the person, why did he undo all the lights?
[70:04.64]This will cover my tracks.
[70:06.28]I'm going to remove all the light bulbs.
[70:08.86]No, you just, that's annoying.
[70:10.02]You didn't do anything.
[70:10.92]You're just irritating.
[70:14.23]Oh, I have an idea.
[70:15.07]I'm going to remove all the light bulbs, but forget about the fucking person I murdered, the blood that's all over the living room.
[70:21.67]Good work, man.
[70:22.35]You did a great job.
[70:29.16]They'll never catch me when I remove the electrical device in the ceiling.
[70:34.52]Oh, that's right.
[70:35.50]Oh, that's right.
[70:36.14]I slashed the person in the stomach.
[70:39.04]Probably should have thrown away that carpet.
[70:42.36]How the devil does it just mean to remove the light bulbs?
[70:49.08]The body and the dresser.
[70:50.28]Don't say that.
[70:55.88]The bed is dirty?
[70:56.72]No, it's not.
[71:01.37]This whole room is clean now, except for this little spot here.
[71:08.00]It looks like that's dirty down there.
[71:11.76]It's very dirty.
[71:12.48]I'm working on it.
[71:14.96]See the minimap there?
[71:16.54]Am I crazy or is that still there?
[71:24.98]That's a tree.
[71:27.13]No, that's not a tree.
[71:27.93]Look at the minimap.
[71:28.55]That's not a tree.
[71:35.35]I'll come back to that.
[71:39.81]tree.
[71:43.01]Alright, upstairs is looking pretty good.
[71:44.45]Maybe one more room.
[71:51.81]More unscrewed light bulbs.
[71:56.40]Okay, I can understand this.
[71:57.44]Maybe he... Maybe they killed the person with the light bulbs.
[72:01.48]Maybe they smashed him up.
[72:04.02]I understand now.
[72:04.68]Okay, so the person took all the light bulbs out of the fixtures, crushed them all up in a bag, and dumped them on the ground, and then power bombed the person, ECW style, onto the light bulbs.
[72:18.11]That would make sense.
[72:25.04]What a way to die.
[72:30.44]And the whole time he had like a bunch of friends over and they were going E-C-D-U-P!
[72:33.80]E-C-D-U-P!
[72:34.90]E-C-D-U-P!
[72:37.78]And then they realized that the person was dead.
[72:40.91]And their little backyard wrestling bullshit.
[72:43.09]Turned out to be pretty fatal, didn't it?
[72:54.33]What are you doing?
[72:58.61]This is not done.
[73:03.97]Oh, right.
[73:10.99]Mm-hmm.
[73:11.81]What kind of... You did it upside down.
[73:14.11]That's upside down.
[73:14.93]That's not correct.
[73:15.61]That's upside down.
[73:19.99]Where are we?
[73:20.89]Are we in America?
[73:21.95]Put the sofa back where it belongs.
[73:28.47]And there's one more behind the cupboard.
[73:36.42]It's Europe.
[73:38.14]Well, that doesn't make any sense because we just sold Walter White's house.
[73:42.25]That's Albuquerque.
[73:58.76]The grounding is actually supposed to go on top.
[74:02.66]Is it though?
[74:05.08]Have I been wrong my entire life?
[74:12.37]Yes?
[74:12.93]Well, how come every house I've ever been in has been like that?
[74:15.51]From accredited, licensed electricians.
[74:21.07]Upstairs is done.
[74:28.11]Furniture-wise, this house doesn't need to be flipped.
[74:31.41]I don't need to do anything else.
[74:32.39]Maybe I'll get some creative liberty in a minute here.
[74:36.83]Now, this is the selling point of the house.
[74:37.92]I don't want to clean that yet.
[74:39.38]Anything else in here?
[74:40.06]Out to the pool.
[74:42.82]A buried body back here?
[74:47.78]That would be fucking crazy.
[74:56.87]Nothing else, right?
[75:04.30]It's out there.
[75:06.08]Clean, clean, clean.
[75:11.50]You thought the murder was a joke?
[75:12.66]Oh, no.
[75:13.18]Somebody died in here.
[75:17.56]No, the selling point.
[75:18.66]It's still there.
[75:19.26]Look, it's fine.
[75:23.96]I didn't clean up the couch in the surrounding area.
[75:35.86]He must have stabbed the fuck out of that guy.
[75:40.42]Turned it into a haunted house.
[75:47.24]Alright.
[75:49.36]I wonder what exactly happens here when you sell a place that doesn't really need to be changed.
[75:55.80]It's been designed.
[75:58.43]It's got a good design team that worked on it.
[76:09.08]That's the extent of what I had to do here.
[76:10.60]I just have to pick up tables.
[76:14.89]Anything else down here that I'm missing?
[76:17.63]What about the garage?
[76:18.33]Fix the counter?
[76:26.41]Don't worry, I'll fix everything.
[76:27.56]Wasn't there a window that needed to be cleaned?
[76:31.80]The counter is uneven.
[76:33.60]It's fine.
[76:36.58]It's fine.
[76:37.10]What do you mean it's uneven?
[76:42.93]Damn it.
[76:43.29]Okay, hold on.
[76:49.54]This isn't even a problem!
[76:51.40]I can't- I can't fix it.
[76:52.86]It's not possible.
[76:53.58]Look.
[76:55.04]This is never going in here ever again the way it was.
[76:56.72]Ah, god damn it.
[76:59.86]Once you get it out, you can never get it back in, can you?
[77:03.85]You know what?
[77:05.07]Just to say, fuck this game.
[77:08.29]I'm gonna give you a fuck the world moment right here, guys.
[77:17.22]Is that uneven?
[77:18.00]Alright, seriously.
[77:24.89]I need to put this back.
[77:26.97]It's not going to ever go in that way again.
[77:29.17]Do you understand this?
[77:30.51]I can't fix this.
[77:34.71]See?
[77:35.67]There's nothing I can do.
[77:36.53]I...
[77:45.29]I'm never gonna hear the end of this, so I have to do it.
[77:59.20]I'm just pulling it out like two inches.
[78:06.27]It's not flush with the wall anymore.
[78:10.01]I don't care.
[78:11.80]And it's over.
[78:12.48]It doesn't matter.
[78:13.12]This is not our problem.
[78:15.28]If they don't like the way that... If they don't like the way that it is, they can just... Look, somebody... They just bring your, like, fat husband into here to go like this.
[78:27.79]He'll just stuff his leg and waist into the wall and smush him back.
[78:31.85]They can do it one by one.
[78:32.89]I'm not big enough to do that.
[78:46.86]Fuck.
[78:58.02]Okay, we're good.
[79:00.12]See, it's like you can't even notice.
[79:01.82]This one's out.
[79:03.32]No, they're all out.
[79:05.12]You can't even tell.
[79:08.87]Stalled by an amateur.
[79:13.55]This is worse than the murder.
[79:15.67]Look, somebody died in here.
[79:19.37]Your number one concern should not be... Oh, no.
[79:23.53]It's uneven.
[79:24.37]It was an old person.
[79:25.19]Look, Grandpa got fucking... They pulled the... Alright, I know what happened.
[79:31.05]This is what happened.
[79:31.85]Okay?
[79:32.43]You don't even need a detective here.
[79:33.69]So, let's see how this just was.
[79:35.03]This was lying down on the ground.
[79:37.43]Somebody slingshot Grandpa into the table.
[79:39.53]Because they wanted the insurance money.
[79:41.50]I understand.
[79:41.92]So...
[79:43.31]This was knocked over here, blood all over this.
[79:46.47]Grandpa was asleep in the chair, facing this way, rocking back and forth.
[79:50.15]The old bastard grandson came over, pulled him back tight, tight, tight, tight, let him go, and he flew, smashed his mouth on the table, rolled over on his back, head hit the light bulb, shattered it, and his brain bled out all over here and everywhere, all over the whole table, and that's how he died.
[80:08.08]In fact, it looked like he tried to get up and fight.
[80:10.39]He didn't make it very far.
[80:16.35]That shit's dangerous, man.
[80:17.29]Don't fuck around.
[80:19.63]I broke my collarbone when I was two years old on one of these.
[80:24.01]Not specifically a rocking chair, but on one of those lazy boys that can go rock, rock, rock.
[80:28.59]Those big rocking lazy boys.
[80:29.89]I was standing on top of it, facing this part of the chair.
[80:33.15]So I was standing like this, and I was just going, ROCK!
[80:37.52]ROCK!
[80:39.45]and it went too far, and I forward-necked myself.
[80:43.61]Like, my legs came over and kicked me in the back of the head because I fell forward like this, and I broke my collarbone when I was two.
[80:54.54]Let's clean this up.
[80:55.22]Joke's over.
[81:03.65]Now we can just sell it.
[81:07.22]Yeah, I broke my column hook because I was standing here rocking and the whole thing went backwards and I went down the roller coaster and I was like at a 90 degree angle down.
[81:17.99]And I hit my chin on the ground and the legs, heels came back over like a spider.
[81:24.97]Like, you know the lady from The Ring, how she put her legs come up and she, like that, like a crab.
[81:40.03]How do I know that I didn't die?
[81:41.37]Um... I don't know.
[81:46.01]What is this?
[81:46.69]Is this one of those Tom Cruise simulations?
[81:49.81]What was the name of that?
[81:51.97]Vanilla Bean?
[81:52.56]What was the name of that fucking dumb movie?
[82:00.28]Oh, by the way, I'd ruin that whole movie for anybody, I think.
[82:02.16]Is this dirt on the rug?
[82:06.36]Got it.
[82:06.60]Alright, this thing's ready to sell.
[82:09.98]I don't even need to do anything here, but I could.
[82:11.66]Let's take a look at any creative freedoms I could have here.
[82:18.66]It's super safe for our baby.
[82:20.24]Alright, should I just... Clean the water out of the pool?
[82:28.57]This is dirty.
[82:29.13]This has got to go.
[82:31.45]I'll get a new one.
[82:36.67]Don't put a slide in the house.
[82:38.11]I wish.
[82:40.52]Uh, it was this one, right?
[82:48.87]Why does this one never fit?
[82:51.99]It never fits.
[82:52.55]How's this?
[82:58.33]This is fine.
[82:59.56]I gotta clean the water out of the pool.
[83:03.26]That's not gonna do anything.
[83:09.28]I'm missing a door here.
[83:14.09]Any other doors missing?
[83:19.05]Why is there no door?
[83:20.49]Who took the door off?
[83:26.37]What color are all the doors here?
[83:27.52]Are they brown?
[83:30.14]Yeah.
[83:30.38]Alright.
[83:35.62]It's time to sell.
[83:47.91]I don't know what I'm doing here.
[83:49.31]What am I thinking?
[83:50.15]Alright, sell it.
[83:52.55]The timeout closet?
[83:53.51]Yeah, it's something creepy.
[83:54.31]I don't know what it is.
[83:59.26]Did I find the corpse?
[84:00.66]I did not find a corpse.
[84:02.18]There's no dead body here.
[84:03.26]Unless it's outside and I didn't see it.
[84:12.35]He didn't find it.
[84:15.23]Is there an Easter egg in this house?
[84:16.51]Do I actually have to find a dead body?
[84:19.89]No, that would increase the rating of this game.
[84:21.93]This game is rated E for everyone, guys.
[84:27.09]Putting a dead body inside of a closet in this game would be the equivalent of... Putting one random... One random, like, F word... In a children's counting game.
[84:42.88]Like, oh yeah, the whole game is just a kid's counting game where you pick numbers, and oh, one, two, three!
[84:49.38]And then randomly, after like an hour of playing, you just hear in the background, fuck.
[84:54.27]And the game's rated M, and you're like, why is this rated M?
[84:56.23]I don't understand.
[84:57.11]It's rated E for G, whatever it is, for everyone.
[85:03.91]No, um, why am I looking, just sell the damn house.
[85:05.93]Why am I looking for a dead body?
[85:07.18]Start the auction.
[85:15.69]Okay, we did it.
[85:18.78]That's $190,000?
[85:22.18]I like that I have a- I want a bedroom in my house, but only one.
[85:27.52]So I actually did make- I made $3,000?
[85:33.80]I want to rent this house to two people, so it'd be great.
[85:36.34]For some reason, people love to watch TV, so it'd be nice to have one in the house.
[85:39.32]There's no TV in this entire house?! !
[85:53.22]Wait, babies love to put their hands in their mouth when they're playing on the floor, so everything needs to be in top order.
[85:58.10]Did they find blood on the ground?
[86:04.66]Okay.
[86:08.64]Well, that's a $30,000 profit.
[86:10.47]I'll take it.
[86:12.95]Give it to me.
[86:15.79]There are too many rooms.
[86:17.81]There's no TV.
[86:19.05]There's no big family room.
[86:25.75]Marry three kids and a grandma.
[86:27.41]What happened to grandpa, I wonder?
[86:29.95]Let's negotiate this one.
[86:34.24]I want an extra $5,000.
[86:34.80]$4,700.
[86:34.82]Thanks.
[86:35.32]There's no reason.
[86:37.60]I just wanted to buy a 265.
[86:46.55]What can we do with this?
[86:59.66]Alright, there's this one here.
[87:03.02]Pink Kingdom.
[87:04.02]I don't have enough money to buy this one.
[87:07.06]Here's Uncle's Bunker.
[87:09.48]A large safe house with a doomsday bunker for sale.
[87:12.69]The condition is for renovation.
[87:18.81]So this actually has a house.
[87:22.17]But the bunkers suck, though.
[87:23.75]What about this one?
[87:24.17]It's Pink Kingdom.
[87:27.11]unique opportunity the sledge star bony bee selling her phenomenal home at a big bargain price so this is some kind of actress or something now I have to paint the house for three hours what if I bought this house just to make everything blue and sold it as the blue house
[87:55.73]I feel like that's very boring, though.
[87:57.29]Okay, but this one.
[87:58.53]This is a huge house.
[88:01.42]I feel like we can do a lot of work with this one.
[88:03.50]How much money is this?
[88:05.28]161.
[88:06.12]Buy it.
[88:07.52]Go.
[88:14.15]We're going to do a ton of work to this house.
[88:25.53]This war it needs work.
[88:28.83]Oh My god, this place is big This is a very large house Back door what else is over here garage?
[88:43.71]Hmm
[88:46.37]all right what's the entrance where I look like tear it down I want to make my own damn house okay so regardless what everybody says about this it's all coming down I want to make my own house with my own rules and my own walls and my own stuff
[89:18.56]I need to sell things first, excuse me.
[89:21.97]Don't need to clean them if you just get rid of them.
[89:38.02]Making money here.
[89:41.28]Throw dynamite in the house?
[89:46.73]I feel like that's a bad idea.
[89:48.31]Okay.
[89:49.89]Clean it up.
[90:01.50]There's like needles there.
[90:02.88]What the hell was that?
[90:03.62]Alright, how much money are you going to give me if I open this up?
[90:09.99]Reach in, whatever's in there, put it in my mouth and eat it.
[90:12.31]Doesn't matter what it is.
[90:16.19]How much money would you do that for?
[90:17.07]20 bucks?
[90:18.41]A lot of shoe boxes for no reason.
[90:23.01]Okay, get rid of all this stuff.
[90:26.15]We're spending the next 16 hours on the stream in this house.
[90:40.60]If you think that's a lie, you are absolutely correct.
[90:48.73]Let's add walls here.
[90:50.01]What happened?
[90:50.85]What's this?
[90:51.80]Oh, right.
[90:53.32]So I can't get rid of the stairs.
[91:03.51]Okay, hold on.
[91:04.23]One piece at a time here.
[91:05.01]I need to spend as long here as I did in Anor Londo.
[91:18.69]Which would put out, what is that?
[91:19.71]Like four, four hours.
[91:26.32]No trash in the front door.
[91:27.68]It doesn't look like it.
[91:29.92]What happened to this?
[91:31.00]Oh, it's double.
[91:36.49]This junk.
[91:40.85]All right.
[91:41.09]What's on the ground here?
[91:43.30]Nothing.
[91:45.37]Alright.
[91:48.56]Excuse me.
[91:49.30]Don't think so.
[91:50.04]Get rid of this shit.
[91:56.26]Put my skill points in.
[91:57.32]Alright.
[91:58.32]Faster cleaning.
[91:59.24]Ultra mop.
[92:01.76]Dispose of all trash in range.
[92:03.18]See the dirt on the mini-map.
[92:04.04]See all dirt or faster cleaning.
[92:10.47]Dispose of trash in range.
[92:11.65]So I just have to walk by it and it gets rid of it.
[92:18.20]That's not real.
[92:22.24]It has to be actually just trash on the ground.
[92:27.64]Break down all the walls.
[92:37.51]I do like this, though.
[92:38.25]This is fun.
[92:38.59]It's fun just to smash walls out.
[92:46.17]Sell the door.
[92:46.69]Alright, that opens it up a lot.
[92:49.73]Taking this whole wall over, too.
[92:52.53]No, I can't.
[92:53.01]This is structural.
[92:54.49]Structural?
[92:55.86]This is structural.
[93:01.62]How many points do I get about a hammer?
[93:05.28]38 destroyed elements means I get faster demolition or a bigger hammer.
[93:09.89]Alright, I need to do this 38 more times.
[93:13.67]Just walk around and hit everything.
[93:22.78]Get Smog's Hammer.
[93:26.60]It's going to be pretty similar, I think.
[93:31.97]Although, what would it be?
[93:33.11]Two different walls?
[93:33.89]Three walls at that point?
[93:36.21]That was very satisfying to do.
[93:38.65]That one felt great.
[93:47.04]It's gone.
[93:48.00]That's it.
[93:48.96]So that opens that way.
[93:50.84]Take this out as well, please.
[93:55.22]This is also apparently structural.
[93:56.96]This cannot go away.
[94:00.50]That's what we call a lot of bullshit.
[94:08.34]Stop counting these.
[94:09.16]It's almost done.
[94:15.16]Structural, structural.
[94:17.70]We're now into structural, but not anymore.
[94:27.36]I'm just gonna have a big open house.
[94:28.78]I have a lot of money.
[94:35.83]Yeah, I sold... I made a lot of good deals, man.
[94:39.23]I made some pretty decent deals.
[94:42.60]Just a big studio.
[94:45.02]One bathroom?
[94:46.38]Yeah, just one bathroom.
[94:47.60]This is going to be the biggest studio apartment you've ever seen.
[94:50.73]I think that's a selling point, actually, to be honest.
[94:57.77]There we go.
[94:58.19]New demolition skill.
[95:00.97]Big professional hammer.
[95:07.37]The ultimate just made it silver.
[95:12.17]How many do I need again?
[95:14.51]117 more destroyers?
[95:15.23]That sucks.
[95:25.94]Somebody made the joke to throw dynamite in here.
[95:29.24]And it's funny you said that because that would actually be more efficient.
[95:33.90]You're right.
[95:37.92]Okay, let's see.
[95:43.77]This ain't even my family.
[95:44.81]Get rid of this shit.
[95:49.75]Thankfully, all the structural stuff is already there.
[95:56.42]If you sold a house, why would you leave pictures of your family there?
[96:02.24]Seems very odd.
[96:02.94]I don't have dynamite.
[96:08.79]How am I supposed to use dynamite if I don't have dynamite?
[96:17.51]There's no explosions in this game.
[96:24.85]Mods?
[96:25.19]There are no mods.
[96:27.15]No mods exist for this game.
[96:31.17]I have to mod it.
[96:35.12]What's going on here?
[96:37.44]Oh, this is... You can't get rid of walls that have this stuff on it.
[96:42.71]Oh, great.
[96:46.07]Well, I think breaking this is not a good idea anymore.
[96:51.61]Open bathroom.
[96:52.71]Everything has to be open.
[96:53.82]The whole thing.
[96:54.38]Open this up.
[97:02.82]No, it's because there's plumbing in there.
[97:04.96]I can't get rid of this.
[97:06.42]Don't worry.
[97:06.82]We're going to make the greatest house you've ever been in in your life.
[97:11.11]It's going to have all the amenities.
[97:14.42]Tons of video games.
[97:16.76]That's right.
[97:21.70]Maybe I can actually make my mall now.
[97:25.44]Did I finally get my mall?
[97:27.90]I wish I could build signs in the game.
[97:30.24]That'd be so much more fun to clean up in here.
[97:38.79]Gross blinds.
[97:42.79]That's not dirty, it's just ugly.
[97:44.51]There we go.
[97:55.39]There's still some dirt left.
[97:59.26]Why are these people even telling me this shit?
[98:01.38]Are these people just watching me do this?
[98:12.07]Go home.
[98:13.02]Why are you still here?
[98:17.52]Actually, I'm going to take this down.
[98:19.48]I want to get the whole thing open.
[98:21.34]Because I want to see what I want to see, you know?
[98:30.28]There's 3,000 people watching me do this?
[98:32.86]Yeah, and they're going to see... They're going to see actually how you should build a house.
[98:38.87]People waste way too much time on absolute dog shit.
[98:42.51]I'll show you what you need to do.
[98:46.89]I've built no houses before, so you should listen to everything I say.
[98:49.55]Alright.
[98:58.61]Get out of this.
[99:01.24]Any more walls I can break before we do the actual building?
[99:05.18]Yep.
[99:06.80]Can't break this one.
[99:07.38]What about that one?
[99:09.38]These are all... We need to keep these.
[99:11.38]What about this has to stay as well?
[99:14.02]And then... Oh, I get rid of that.
[99:20.50]I'm going to run into a serious problem where I... I'm going to leave it open.
[99:27.72]I think I'm going to leave it open.
[99:28.67]We're going to put a carton where the bathroom is.
[99:42.97]Why?
[99:43.27]I'm not sure yet.
[99:48.17]I'm sure I'll figure that out as we go.
[99:54.34]Did Picasso know what painting he was going to paint?
[99:58.56]When he made Starry Night?
[100:00.68]No, he just started painting.
[100:03.90]Was Van Gogh supposed to know exactly what he was painting?
[100:06.63]No, he saw it and just painted it as he saw it.
[100:16.84]I'm gonna clean up in here first.
[100:21.46]He closed his eyes, with a blank canvas, and then decided, hey, this is what I'm gonna do now.
[100:28.65]Nobody gave Picasso a painting already, and then he just painted over it.
[100:32.39]No.
[100:33.69]Empty fucking house, blank canvas.
[100:43.59]This is fine.
[100:44.65]I gotta get it all clean first.
[100:46.95]First of all, step one.
[100:49.75]Delete Venetian blinds.
[100:56.35]Do not ever have Venetian blinds in your house.
[101:01.87]They are actually the worst, and I can't even get rid of them.
[101:06.04]Please let me remove these, please.
[101:12.20]I can't.
[101:15.43]I don't want this place anymore.
[101:16.23]This place sucks.
[101:23.89]That's good.
[101:27.61]Clean up.
[101:31.71]No, just wait.
[101:32.27]Just watch.
[101:32.79]Just wait.
[101:34.07]You'll see.
[101:34.47]This house is going to be pretty sweet, actually.
[101:46.24]Just, I got the plan already.
[101:48.02]Just wait till you see what I do here.
[101:50.36]You're gonna wish you had this house.
[101:51.72]Let me clean it first.
[102:10.93]Cleaning takes precedence over anything else.
[102:18.29]Everything is so dirty, though, it's hard to even tell what needs to be cleaned and what is just ugly.
[102:25.58]That's good.
[102:26.40]All right.
[102:28.02]Anyone with dirt?
[102:30.28]Yeah, this place is a disaster.
[102:31.42]Use.
[102:31.72]Oh, okay.
[102:34.87]So you activate the slingshot.
[102:37.47]Clean the window.
[102:37.93]Is this music making you fall asleep?
[102:46.39]Pretty relaxing stuff.
[102:48.47]I could see that.
[102:56.12]107,000.
[102:56.16]So what happens when you get to the end of the game?
[103:00.70]Once we flip this and buy the last house, is that it?
[103:05.48]Fuck, I didn't mean to do that.
[103:08.66]I'll come back.
[103:08.98]I'll fix it later.
[103:18.39]I only need one bedroom.
[103:20.59]Do you understand?
[103:21.81]And the house of a real man is no place for children's toys.
[103:27.97]That's the guy we're selling to, by the way.
[103:29.33]He's gonna love it.
[103:29.87]And the house of a strong, independent woman is no room for stuff for little snots.
[103:35.27]What the fuck are they talking about?
[103:40.03]Great pictures!
[103:48.43]Yeah?
[103:50.23]No, we didn't like that.
[103:51.53]We didn't like that.
[103:52.71]No pictures!
[104:02.10]I don't like it anymore.
[104:03.22]Bye.
[104:06.68]Not a bad picture.
[104:12.30]He's freaking me out.
[104:17.81]Where's this picture that she's referring to?
[104:27.85]I'm gonna fuck with this lady's head.
[104:29.55]Big time.
[104:30.34]Watch this.
[104:30.74]Yeah?
[104:45.84]What do you think?
[104:52.44]Do you like this?
[104:53.64]Is it something that you would consider moving into?
[104:56.68]Yeah.
[104:56.96]How about now?
[105:02.26]I'll think about it.
[105:05.84]She's not saying it.
[105:07.54]Oh.
[105:12.50]I wonder if I can like break her program.
[105:16.20]Yeah, I fucked up her program.
[105:19.38]She saw the pictures and by the time she said the sentence, no.
[105:24.88]Oh, she figured it out.
[105:29.02]No pictures.
[105:29.70]Ah, I'm back down to the bottom.
[105:34.95]The old people want the pictures too, though.
[105:37.27]Don't worry.
[105:38.63]We're going to fill one room with pictures.
[105:40.69]That's it.
[105:41.17]There's nothing else going to be in that room.
[105:44.35]Alright, let's get down to it here.
[105:59.01]There's only one room.
[106:02.73]There's gonna be a method here.
[106:03.81]You'll see.
[106:08.77]Is this structural?
[106:11.13]How is that structural?
[106:17.23]Yeah, personal taste has nothing to do with the house.
[106:23.46]Just like you don't enjoy the way it's being shown?
[106:26.10]I don't understand.
[106:29.19]The bathroom kind of has to stay there, though.
[106:32.97]This can't be broken, and neither can this.
[106:36.09]For a second, I thought that said I cannot destroy the wall with pictures.
[106:38.91]He's taking it seriously.
[106:42.31]Alright.
[106:52.84]I'm getting close.
[106:58.87]It's all the clean slate here.
[107:02.41]It's all that matters.
[107:05.55]I have to be getting close to another point here, right?
[107:07.29]96 more walls to destroy.
[107:10.73]Jesus.
[107:14.77]Okay, get the door out of there.
[107:16.45]Alright, I'm starting to see what I want here.
[107:21.27]This is... Looks like closet space that came down here and a bathroom.
[107:25.71]We can make a huge bathroom.
[107:29.71]Can I destroy the ceiling?
[107:31.29]No, of course not.
[107:37.89]No streamer, no buy?
[107:39.45]What do you mean no streamer?
[107:46.26]Don't leave the toilet running.
[107:47.56]No, I'm well aware of the issues with that.
[107:50.06]Except that didn't do anything.
[107:52.66]It just did it on its own.
[107:56.21]That was the floor.
[107:57.01]That was the
[108:00.24]This is the ceiling for down... I meant to say... Can I remove the ceiling?
[108:05.36]As in, can I get rid of the second floor?
[108:09.42]You can't, though.
[108:10.09]Okay, that's fine.
[108:13.61]This cannot be destroyed.
[108:15.13]Clean.
[108:16.61]Clean.
[108:17.35]Clean.
[108:20.05]Oh, this mold... This really needs to be... What about back here?
[108:24.64]No, plumbing.
[108:26.30]Plumbing.
[108:30.69]Okay, almost done.
[108:39.62]Can you build your own stairs too?
[108:47.40]It's just turning into.
[108:49.94]I'm getting lost.
[108:50.88]I have an idea.
[108:52.24]I have this idea for a Pee Wee Herman fireman house where there's a room that builds over here and I can just jump down to breakfast.
[109:01.21]I'm starting to see how that might not even be real because I can't get rid of the stairs.
[109:12.98]Did Pee Wee Herman have a fire pole in his house that he slid down?
[109:18.11]He did, right?
[109:18.71]Or is this completely... I'm making this up.
[109:26.33]Yeah, he did.
[109:27.62]Okay.
[109:31.56]Get rid of that.
[109:44.24]I don't know what to do now.
[109:45.64]Oh, it's alright.
[109:49.17]I'll figure it out.
[109:53.91]What clutter.
[109:58.01]I just wish this hammer wasn't so bad.
[109:59.58]I need a bigger hammer.
[110:05.32]Sell it right now?
[110:06.16]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[110:08.20]Everything's gonna be fine.
[110:12.22]What am I doing?
[110:12.80]I'm trying to open up the whole house so then I can piece by piece make the rooms I want.
[110:16.26]But then I'm starting to realize that this game is not for you to build houses.
[110:20.22]It's for you to paint the walls and then resell it.
[110:25.14]I'm shaving against the grain right now.
[110:29.10]I'm going to end up with all kinds of blisters.
[110:35.09]Okay, that's the whole house has been taken.
[110:37.19]Not this one.
[110:37.69]Hold on.
[110:47.65]Done.
[110:48.97]Now we can finally start to build the house.
[110:50.41]Let's see.
[110:56.51]Corner to corner.
[110:57.13]How are we doing?
[111:02.53]Now I can have a kitchen wherever I want.
[111:04.49]I'm okay with this.
[111:07.39]The hole upstairs is now open.
[111:09.17]All of downstairs is open too.
[111:18.18]As much as it can be, right?
[111:25.69]I hate how this is right here.
[111:27.09]I don't understand this whole bathroom next to the kitchen thing.
[111:30.61]Can somebody fill me in on this?
[111:35.94]Why would there be a bathroom right next to the stove?
[111:40.79]If somebody drops a fucking dump in the toilet here, all the stink air is going to flow out when the door opens and go into the oven and cook with the food.
[111:51.19]How does any... I don't understand this.
[111:52.85]Why would you have a bathroom right here and right next to the stove?
[111:59.18]Imagine sitting here and, oh, I got to go to the bathroom.
[112:01.68]And there's a... If you're eating over here or over here... No, the bathroom's going to be over here.
[112:07.16]Down here.
[112:11.29]Why would you want the toilet right next to the sink in the bathroom?
[112:15.20]Not the bathroom, the kitchen.
[112:16.42]You know what I'm saying?
[112:18.02]I'm just telling, I'm being real.
[112:20.80]22 times.
[112:21.24]All right.
[112:24.10]Kitchen's down here, but I don't want the kitchen down here.
[112:26.28]In fact, yeah.
[112:27.52]Fuck that.
[112:30.00]You think I'm making that up?
[112:31.78]Kitchen's going upstairs.
[112:35.11]Away from the toilet.
[112:47.13]Clean the windows.
[112:51.93]I'm so adamant about the... I would do this if I bought the house in real life.
[113:02.54]Every window has to be cleaned.
[113:09.19]We're going to do what typically would be downstairs is going upstairs.
[113:17.94]What's the big problem with the upstairs kitchen?
[113:22.19]Why is that such a problem?
[113:25.35]Why is that such a big deal?
[113:26.33]Why does nobody do that?
[113:31.33]No, no, no, no.
[113:32.25]You see, there's a difference between me going here to cook my dinner versus here.
[113:38.87]Who cares?
[113:45.05]Come up here and then you can just have a vent?
[113:48.08]Right here.
[113:49.43]The kitchen's going right here.
[113:51.45]You could have a vent right here that blows it right out the door.
[113:58.45]You could blow it right out the roof.
[114:02.11]Because then all the stink of the cooking wouldn't get all over the whole house.
[114:07.21]Oh, you cooked with garlic down here?
[114:08.77]Good luck.
[114:09.18]It's going to fill the whole house now.
[114:10.60]You cook upstairs with a vent that leads out this way?
[114:14.86]No one's going to smell anything.
[114:19.66]Yeah, let me just move my fridge, oven, dishwasher up the stairs.
[114:25.68]Why haven't you?
[114:26.76]You keep talking about it.
[114:29.08]Okay, let's go.
[114:30.58]Kitchen.
[114:34.72]And then all the bedrooms can be downstairs and nobody even needs to know you're cooking.
[114:41.10]Heat rises.
[114:42.34]Smell rises.
[114:46.56]More people are going to start doing this.
[114:47.64]I just started a trend.
[114:48.86]Like me or not.
[114:49.52]Hey, like me or not.
[114:50.52]Yeah, I just started a trend.
[114:53.12]I'm looking it up.
[114:58.49]Why are kitchens never upstairs?
[115:03.77]Why are kitchens never on the second floor of a house?
[115:10.44]Blah, blah, blah.
[115:16.49]Do you want to have to carry a refrigerator up the stairs?
[115:21.47]That's it.
[115:26.43]Unless you were rich, most houses had a fireplace downstairs.
[115:32.52]The upstairs, if it existed, was unheated.
[115:35.24]The main fireplace would exist in the kitchen, and it was typically kept going, so it was a place for families to stay warm efficiently.
[115:43.38]It would make no sense to cart fuel, food, water, and ale upstairs.
[115:47.38]In Europe, servants had enough trouble drawing baths upstairs in the past.
[115:51.77]It would take money, trip... You're talking about fucking ancient history.
[115:56.57]This is ancient history.
[115:59.17]I can send you a text right now in five seconds.
[116:01.07]Get your goddamn kitchen upstairs.
[116:10.24]It's cheaper to run under the house?
[116:12.87]Why?
[116:13.19]I don't understand.
[116:15.03]No, we're doing an upstairs kitchen.
[116:19.59]And it's going right over here.
[116:20.41]I'm going to start that room right now.
[116:22.78]So, this kitchen is going to be a huge open kitchen.
[116:25.40]This is everything I ever dreamed of.
[116:26.58]Having my own, like, chef apartment up here.
[116:29.54]Yeah, fuck this.
[116:30.44]Watch this one, guys.
[116:38.46]The higher the water, the worse it tastes.
[116:42.48]Wait, hold on.
[116:43.92]Are you telling me that because the water is up a floor, it tastes worse?
[116:57.57]What?
[116:59.89]What?
[117:00.15]I knocked the wall down just to put it back up.
[117:02.97]Fuck!
[117:04.09]You're correct.
[117:04.91]No, you're not.
[117:05.63]Because I took the wall down here and...
[117:15.89]I need to paint the walls first.
[117:17.14]I gotta get the flow.
[117:25.90]I'm seeing it as a bedroom, and that's not what I should be seeing it as.
[117:30.38]What about apartments?
[117:31.06]Yeah, apartments have kitchens upstairs, technically, in their house.
[117:34.34]Alright, let's get this going.
[117:38.18]So, from here to here, this is all gonna be the kitchen.
[117:43.06]This is going to be like Gordon Ramsay's house.
[117:45.62]Far enough away from the bathroom, that's fine.
[117:51.09]So let's change this.
[117:52.63]Let's get store.
[117:58.85]Floors.
[117:59.47]Floor panels and coverings.
[118:02.53]No carpet.
[118:03.62]All hardwood.
[118:05.30]Except this is a kitchen.
[118:08.30]So we're going to go with...
[118:11.27]Um... This is not bad.
[118:15.43]Let's check this one out.
[118:24.18]Is that a... That's fine.
[118:32.36]Nice tile in the kitchen.
[118:34.28]It's ugly.
[118:35.77]Well, it ain't your kitchen.
[118:38.23]You can handle it.
[118:40.21]So that leads to right here.
[118:45.10]You'll see.
[118:45.62]It's going to be nice.
[118:46.38]It's going to be a nice light gray on the light white.
[118:53.90]Just hold on.
[118:54.44]You'll see.
[118:54.86]It's an 80s diner.
[119:01.52]Good.
[119:02.52]Good.
[119:05.03]No, don't do that.
[119:05.71]It's not worth it.
[119:07.73]He's diner fine fuck it You want to make this is you want to make the joke fine?
[119:15.91]I'm running a business upstairs the whole thing's a diner You think this is a joke You come upstairs and now I run a business I
[119:38.10]You just have to walk through my foyer to get here.
[119:41.98]This is the company.
[119:42.91]This is the bathroom.
[119:43.69]It's fine because all the... I like this.
[119:45.89]I love this idea.
[119:46.79]I love this idea of having my own upstairs business bathroom.
[119:49.57]Upstairs business bathroom associated with an upstairs business that is a diner.
[119:54.23]That means we gotta have one of those open kitchens where people can look in and see me going, like, get the fucking steak on there!
[120:01.61]You fucking... Oh, this is perfect.
[120:09.08]You missed a tileware.
[120:15.74]I can't see it.
[120:25.01]Yeah, everybody loves to watch the chef just get pissed off and scream at people.
[120:29.97]Open kitchen design where you can see them cooking.
[120:33.57]And you can watch me just be a fucking tyrant in the kitchen.
[120:38.74]Where's this tile?
[120:42.60]I... Hold on.
[120:43.60]Get rid of this rug.
[120:48.50]Oh, you fucking donkey.
[120:55.31]Hey, you guys are freaking me out.
[120:56.63]I don't see a tile missing.
[121:05.03]It's by the bathroom?
[121:16.57]I don't see it.
[121:18.93]Next to the stairs?
[121:19.87]Huh?
[121:43.89]Fuck, this is not the right one.
[122:01.34]It's nothing here.
[122:02.12]You guys are freaking me out enough with this.
[122:04.28]There's no tile here that hasn't been placed.
[122:07.80]Alright, I gotta go.
[122:12.56]Let's paint the walls.
[122:13.38]We're gonna have a nice diner look.
[122:17.32]Wall painting.
[122:18.04]I'm gonna say... Could just do white.
[122:26.01]Fiery orange.
[122:27.73]Should this be a Denny's?
[122:30.51]Lavender?
[122:31.16]No.
[122:31.68]Royal blue?
[122:32.26]Sky blue?
[122:37.58]No, I gotta fix the plaster here.
[122:45.37]Plaster bucket, put it down there.
[122:46.71]Alright.
[122:50.20]Load it up.
[122:57.22]That's good.
[122:57.78]I'm physically dying because of this tile.
[123:07.25]Don't worry, you're gonna be fine.
[123:14.82]Trust me, you're gonna be just fine.
[123:16.20]Alright, that's enough plaster.
[123:18.80]Alright, let's paint now.
[123:24.78]Paint.
[123:25.04]And then we're gonna make little booths for people to sit.
[123:30.84]This color is very important, though.
[123:35.86]Pistachio green?
[123:39.68]Icy blue?
[123:42.45]Let's try pistachio green.
[124:01.14]No, that's a dentist office.
[124:03.84]Should I switch it to a dentist office?
[124:07.20]I could put the chairs and have a couple waiting rooms.
[124:10.14]Should I make this a dentist office?
[124:12.03]I think I'm gonna.
[124:17.99]You know what the funny thing is?
[124:18.95]You know how many people have their dentist office upstairs in their house?
[124:23.67]That would make sense.
[124:25.94]No, what about gray fog?
[124:33.56]This might be too dark.
[124:43.59]This is bad.
[124:46.76]No.
[124:47.84]This is not going to work either.
[124:49.54]It needs to be a little bit brighter.
[124:55.56]They're all so dark.
[124:56.57]Icy blue?
[125:08.44]That's not bad.
[125:10.50]Icy blue's not bad.
[125:16.47]We could even do a thing.
[125:17.57]We could do a thing where this is... Let's do two.
[125:21.65]Okay, hold on a minute.
[125:22.33]I'm getting some inspiration here.
[125:25.05]We're gonna do three.
[125:30.61]Quiet, quiet, quiet.
[125:32.17]Quiet, hold on.
[125:33.62]Okay, I got it.
[125:34.58]Let's see how this looks.
[125:36.46]One, two, three.
[125:42.26]One, two, three.
[125:49.93]Two.
[125:51.43]One, two, three.
[125:52.17]Fucking dumb thing.
[126:02.21]Stop it!
[126:06.67]One, two.
[126:07.93]One, two, three.
[126:14.12]One, two.
[126:19.90]Just wait.
[126:20.68]Hold on.
[126:25.69]It's so dark in here.
[126:31.27]One, two.
[126:31.95]One, two, three.
[126:37.20]Now you got 1, 2, 1, 2, 3.
[126:40.88]What?
[126:41.06]This is like delayed.
[126:43.10]My keyboard is delayed.
[126:44.20]I'm pressing A or D and it's moving like a half second later.
[126:48.08]Why is this happening?
[126:50.95]Okay.
[127:02.65]1, 2.
[127:02.85]1, 2.
[127:07.98]Fucking paint.
[127:09.46]Fuck the paint, seriously.
[127:17.00]Just, you'll understand when you see it.
[127:20.43]In fact, let me just show you now.
[127:25.71]Where was that gray?
[127:28.57]This is gonna look very nice.
[127:40.00]See?
[127:48.79]Just wait.
[127:49.19]Hold on.
[127:49.79]Wait till the whole room is done.
[127:51.17]And then you can hold your judgment till then.
[128:02.26]There's not enough light for you to see it.
[128:05.62]You're judging it based off of this terrible lighting and how the rest of the... You know, you gotta wait till it's all done.
[128:12.96]In fact, put a light in here now just so I can see what I'm doing.
[128:21.23]No, no, no.
[128:21.57]I gotta just pick ceiling lamps.
[128:24.35]Let's put a couple of halogens in here just so I can see what I'm doing.
[128:42.98]It hurts to me to do this.
[128:44.32]Alright.
[128:46.60]Switch.
[128:50.38]Switch, please.
[128:56.05]I need a... Just give me a switch.
[129:03.67]I haven't even begun.
[129:04.41]1, 2, 3.
[129:04.47]1, 2.
[129:09.07]1, 2.
[129:19.24]Yeah, alright, alright, alright.
[129:21.74]Everyone that wants to try to tell me that this... This is actually starting to look... Like... An E3 booth.
[129:33.84]For... Alright, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[129:36.28]I'm gonna commit.
[129:37.62]You have to commit.
[129:40.10]Sorry, I'm committing.
[129:44.92]Alright, we'll have an E3 upstairs.
[129:46.82]I'm having my own video game conference in my house.
[129:49.48]Fuck the diner.
[129:50.68]Fuck the dentist office.
[129:51.60]We're doing our own video game conference upstairs.
[129:53.65]And this is the booth of the Legend of Zelda Breath of the Windmaker.
[130:07.20]I actually don't like... I don't hate this.
[130:09.58]You guys do.
[130:10.16]I don't.
[130:10.50]I think it's cool.
[130:12.88]I like my dumb E3 booth.
[130:16.84]That's not correct.
[130:18.08]Actually, I like it better that it's not correct.
[130:20.26]No, I don't.
[130:20.68]I hate that.
[130:21.48]Fix that, please.
[130:28.50]I'm gonna fix it.
[130:29.86]You can't get it right on the first try every time.
[130:41.43]So what is the middle?
[130:42.23]The middle has to be...
[130:44.22]It's never gonna work, because there's two, but it's not gonna work.
[130:49.00]There always has to be a problem here.
[130:52.32]Because it's not symmetrical.
[130:59.40]Why wouldn't you do red for, like, the Nintendo Switch?
[131:09.31]No, I... I can't.
[131:13.17]I'm not having a fucking Nintendo Switch house.
[131:22.10]I wish I could throw that paint can into the wall.
[131:25.92]It only works if you do double stripes.
[131:37.92]When can I get upgrades for this?
[131:41.48]Ten more destroyed elements.
[131:44.88]Sell one more thing.
[131:47.82]Six more painted walls allows me 25% faster painting.
[131:51.24]I need to buy insurance and burn this place down.
[132:10.71]Eventually, when this is done, we're going to be scrolling back and people are going to say, that was actually really great, Jeremy.
[132:16.07]You did an excellent job here.
[132:24.98]One, two.
[132:31.17]Red and green.
[132:32.87]I've already made my mind.
[132:52.18]The tile.
[132:53.14]There's no tile to replace.
[132:59.81]Why should I watch this?
[133:01.65]I don't know.
[133:02.11]That's on you.
[133:02.95]Let me fill in the blanks.
[133:12.52]Watch the clip.
[133:15.30]Alright, wait.
[133:16.40]Calm down.
[133:16.96]I'm watching the clip right now.
[133:26.22]You think this is a joke?
[133:32.72]It blends in perfectly with the ground.
[133:46.11]Where is it?
[133:46.99]I'm looking at it right now and I don't even know where it is.
[133:49.03]I don't know where it is and I'm staring at it.
[133:54.53]Hold on.
[133:55.23]Where is it though?
[133:57.68]It's perfectly hidden.
[134:02.00]It's a goddamn chameleon.
[134:05.95]Down and to the left?
[134:08.85]It's right here.
[134:09.73]No way.
[134:20.05]No way you guys can see that.
[134:23.72]Do you understand how that is the same as this?
[134:29.06]Like, how would you... I mean, I guess you saw me do it, but from the naked eye, you tell me that there's a tile missing there.
[134:38.14]Holy shit, man.
[134:39.16]That's fucking hilarious.
[134:40.62]Okay, let's go.
[134:42.90]Floor tiles.
[134:59.79]I'm having a good time right now.
[135:02.71]This is fun.
[135:04.68]Everybody else is having fun right now.
[135:07.30]Something about this game is I just have fun playing it.
[135:09.54]I don't know why.
[135:17.67]It's just something about it.
[135:18.53]We're just having a little bit of fun right now.
[135:31.80]Alright, we're almost at the bathroom.
[135:35.76]Shit.
[135:38.00]The whole thing's off.
[135:40.66]No, it's not.
[135:48.50]Okay.
[135:48.64]I'm just gonna put the wall here.
[135:54.16]Fill in the blanks.
[135:55.03]We're not missing anything else.
[135:56.27]One, two.
[135:56.73]There it is.
[135:57.41]One, two.
[135:58.25]Uh-oh.
[136:08.99]No, it's not gonna be an open bathroom.
[136:10.18]I'm gonna close it off.
[136:18.78]Don't do that.
[136:19.94]One, two, leave it.
[136:21.18]One, two, three.
[136:23.36]What the fuck happened there?
[136:24.80]Okay.
[136:25.86]Seriously.
[136:33.76]The whole thing has to be a bathroom.
[136:35.04]No, it's a diner.
[136:36.31]It's a diner.
[136:40.02]Something's off about this.
[136:41.02]I don't know.
[136:41.64]Something's off.
[136:48.91]Something's off about the E3 booth.
[136:56.69]I really just need to put a bunch of computers up here.
[136:58.93]I wish I could put a guy, a really overly enthusiastic guy to stand here and tell me about the games that are on display.
[137:14.73]It doesn't look right on the windows.
[137:16.96]1, 2.
[137:17.42]1, 2, 3.
[137:18.22]1, 2, 3.
[137:19.64]This is not right.
[137:20.88]This is incorrect.
[137:27.10]That's better.
[137:27.58]Alright, that's better.
[137:30.65]Now this needs to go up here.
[137:34.65]Alright.
[137:35.75]Now it's... I'm fine now.
[137:37.09]That was the problem.
[137:40.97]Now this is a problem.
[137:42.80]I can't fix it.
[137:54.35]Who gives a shit?
[137:58.81]Get bored of the windows of the different color.
[138:00.58]That's true.
[138:03.18]What if I did something else inside?
[138:05.14]That would fix everything.
[138:06.10]You're right.
[138:08.96]What if I just did this?
[138:10.41]I got a new idea.
[138:11.57]Just bear with me here.
[138:44.52]It was blue.
[138:49.13]Just wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[138:50.25]You'll see.
[139:23.77]Now it just looks like there's shadows everywhere.
[139:29.70]It was too harsh.
[139:30.38]I'm trying to lighten it up, but no.
[139:31.54]Now it just looks like there's random shadows.
[139:39.30]Do the whole fucking thing, Blue.
[139:40.53]The whole thing.
[139:41.61]I'm done with it.
[139:49.25]Do it all, Blue.
[139:49.87]The whole thing.
[139:51.31]If I need to do lines, I'll do lines.
[139:53.15]I'm trying to do this piece by piece.
[139:54.53]This is stupid.
[139:54.97]This is not how professional painters do it.
[139:56.55]They paint the whole fucking room blue, and then they go piece by piece and add little detail work.
[140:10.12]Paint how you feel.
[140:11.12]Angry.
[140:23.77]That looks good.
[140:24.37]Better.
[140:24.99]Much better.
[140:26.53]I feel like I can breathe now.
[140:32.37]He's more alive than he's ever been?
[140:34.07]Wait, what?
[140:42.57]That's better so far.
[140:44.19]It'll be fixed.
[140:49.36]I'm too indecisive with this shit.
[140:50.78]Feels like in real life
[140:58.46]This is a happy game.
[140:59.28]Oh, yeah, it is.
[141:08.30]Okay.
[141:09.78]Almost done.
[141:14.94]What was I thinking?
[141:15.92]I was going to do this along the whole thing.
[141:17.84]It would have just looked like a giant curtain was encompassing the house.
[141:23.93]That was what the plan was.
[141:25.25]What a bad plan.
[141:33.24]Looks fine.
[141:34.20]Don't let that happen.
[141:37.08]We'll do red.
[141:37.78]No, what are the E3 colors?
[141:40.22]No, we're going back to the diner idea.
[141:56.13]There's too many thoughts up here.
[141:58.61]I have to squelch them.
[142:02.42]You know what I'm talking about?
[142:03.18]Now the room is brighter.
[142:15.45]Missed a line.
[142:16.05]I'll go back and fix it.
[142:17.47]Don't worry.
[142:21.09]I'm going to put blue paint cans around the whole house, by the way.
[142:26.09]So I don't have to walk around.
[142:28.82]I got $110,000.
[142:29.00]I don't need to penny pinch.
[142:35.01]Is a bug in here?
[142:35.57]Yeah, a bug flew in here.
[142:37.25]I don't care.
[142:37.65]As long as you don't drink the bug, you're going to be fine.
[142:43.13]Just avoid drinking them.
[142:44.01]Just spin the cup around while you're drinking.
[143:00.94]Are we in emote only mode?
[143:02.42]What happened?
[143:06.44]Did they misbehave?
[143:08.34]What did they do?
[143:10.68]What did they say?
[143:11.31]What did they do?
[143:13.51]Who started it?
[143:14.17]Who did it?
[143:18.15]You're in deep shit.
[143:24.00]I did?
[143:24.34]What did I say?
[143:25.48]Did I say something weird?
[143:28.70]Always paint with windows open, because if not, you're gonna breathe in paint fumes.
[143:31.75]You don't want to do that.
[143:36.43]Okay.
[143:37.87]We did it.
[143:38.93]Everything's fine, except for in the- no, the corner?
[143:40.67]Are we good?
[143:41.05]Alright, finally.
[143:45.25]No, not- not good, actually.
[143:54.14]You know how long it takes to paint a whole house?
[143:58.01]It takes six months.
[144:01.37]You know why?
[144:02.19]Because I can't handle it.
[144:04.87]Just paint it yourself.
[144:06.03]No, it's fun.
[144:08.53]I do one five foot quadrant and instantly have to leave.
[144:15.99]Okay, I got that done.
[144:17.92]That was the worst thing I've ever done in my life.
[144:19.80]And I leave for a whole day.
[144:24.26]And then I come back and I don't like the color and I change it.
[144:29.06]You wouldn't believe how many times I've swatched on the wall in my house.
[144:33.86]At least like 17 different colors.
[144:36.02]I hated all of them.
[144:46.61]It was only because my brother came over here and said, that one looks alright.
[144:52.05]And internally, I was just struggling and screaming.
[144:55.21]And I was so glad that somebody came over here and just said, hey, do this one.
[144:59.39]Okay.
[145:00.21]Yeah, that one looks pretty good.
[145:01.85]Yeah, I like that one.
[145:02.63]I was thinking about that one.
[145:10.02]This is dirty over here.
[145:16.16]How are we looking?
[145:16.80]Better?
[145:19.38]Artistic disorder?
[145:23.95]What did you just say?
[145:34.36]I didn't miss a spot.
[145:35.52]I got it.
[145:36.08]Everything's clean.
[145:37.88]I didn't miss a... Got it.
[145:47.05]Okay, we're good.
[145:49.33]Now can I finally... Yes, we're fine.
[145:55.01]Nope.
[145:57.69]Do you see just how... This never ends.
[146:07.90]You hate it.
[146:10.18]Well, you can hate it, but you're sure gonna give rave reviews on Yelp about the food.
[146:17.77]You're gonna dock points based off of the fact that you didn't like the color of the wall?
[146:28.41]And you guys, I've been playing you guys this whole time.
[146:32.49]Didn't think I was turning this into an ice cream shop.
[146:35.21]But, you know, that's just next level that I'm thinking here.
[146:44.61]Here's the counter.
[146:46.95]Right here.
[146:48.53]All the flavors right here.
[146:50.21]Couple of chairs, couple of tables.
[146:52.31]And a bathroom.
[146:53.43]Can't go wrong with, you know, you can't.
[146:54.69]That's right.
[146:55.63]Ice cream store.
[147:04.58]Alright, that's good.
[147:05.40]Get rid of this.
[147:06.72]Oh my god, what a clutter.
[147:08.12]There's some trash in the room.
[147:11.58]Shut up.
[147:11.98]Alright.
[147:13.60]I need to make a wall section here.
[147:18.33]I wish I could put it on the ground.
[147:21.73]Because I can't technically do this and then break it, right?
[147:24.65]I need enough room.
[147:30.69]Let me see if I can do this.
[147:32.79]Can I just break the top?
[147:41.55]You have to be real tall to order ice cream here.
[147:44.36]No, this is not going to work at all because I need a place to put the... Because there needs to be an ice cream display.
[148:02.17]Hold on, let me see if this is like the glass installations.
[148:04.05]Let me see.
[148:05.45]No, kitchen...
[148:09.93]You know what I could turn this into?
[148:11.05]You know those stupid serve yourself frozen yogurt stores?
[148:13.95]You know what I'm saying?
[148:16.38]Like this shit where they're just everywhere.
[148:21.18]There's just frozen yogurt spigots everywhere.
[148:27.94]You like those places?
[148:28.80]I don't like those places.
[148:32.29]Because it allows you to have no self-control.
[148:33.93]They do it by weight.
[148:37.15]Any place that sells you ice cream by weight is not... That's a dangerous place.
[148:45.12]I need somebody to scoop me out one scoop and put it in there.
[148:49.28]I don't want to go to the spigot and hold the thing down and just slime a pound and a half of ice cream into a container and bring it up there.
[148:58.95]It's your fault that you got a 10 pound frozen yogurt.
[149:01.63]No, but if somebody's able to control me, give me one scoop with like a little bit of two small little sprinkles of Reese's, right?
[149:11.89]They have a container there where you reach in and just dump Reese's into the container.
[149:14.97]You could just go up there and just fill a large cup with gummy bears and weigh it and then leave.
[149:23.44]I don't like that.
[149:31.13]Reese's.
[149:31.69]Yes.
[149:32.19]Reese's PCs.
[149:36.25]I got to put a radiator here.
[149:45.59]Home appliances.
[149:46.21]What else do they have?
[149:47.73]Heater.
[149:48.13]Refrigerator.
[149:51.01]Stove.
[149:52.60]Which one of these looks more ice creamy, do you think?
[149:56.52]This looks kind of ice cream, but it doesn't match.
[150:00.18]This kind of looks like an ice cream station.
[150:02.90]Here's the weighing station.
[150:04.45]No, we're not doing that idea.
[150:05.57]Let's do this.
[150:16.41]Okay.
[150:23.96]Now we need to build...
[150:27.62]Some kind of device where I can have a counter.
[150:34.65]I sit on a sofa back here.
[150:37.81]It's just a guy sitting on a sofa.
[150:39.67]And he gets up.
[150:40.31]What do you want?
[150:41.89]You want vanilla?
[150:43.01]Okay, I got that.
[150:43.67]And he just stands up and opens the freezer.
[150:45.51]And hands it to you.
[150:47.16]Sits back down.
[150:47.86]Doesn't even have a cash register.
[150:48.84]So you have to pay in cash.
[150:53.66]Survival.
[150:54.30]Okay, hold on.
[151:04.81]Should I have a sewer?
[151:06.27]But this leads right... This is great.
[151:08.91]Okay, so how do you... Drips.
[151:13.24]It'll just drip down to me when I'm down there.
[151:15.84]Wall panels.
[151:16.70]No, we need other... Alright, hold on.
[151:22.52]Yep, this can have the flavors of the ice cream on it.
[151:27.75]Right here.
[151:29.81]No, it's gonna be... We'll make a line, too.
[151:34.11]I don't know how we're going to make the fucking line because it's going to be right there leading out to here.
[151:38.63]So here's the flavors.
[151:41.31]Right here.
[151:42.05]So when you're looking over there, it's got them all listed.
[151:47.23]Anything else I can put in here that makes sense?
[151:50.65]Is it where the money is?
[151:54.69]Why would I have the money back?
[151:55.59]No, this is like the register.
[151:57.11]Yeah, because that's where the cash comes in, the change comes in and out of here.
[152:01.35]Flavors the ice cream.
[152:05.62]Hold on.
[152:08.53]Alright, alright.
[152:09.07]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[152:09.83]I got it, I got it.
[152:10.71]I got it.
[152:13.43]Now I need to rotate.
[152:15.69]Shit.
[152:16.33]This needs to come like this.
[152:19.54]Across.
[152:19.90]You know what I'm saying?
[152:23.34]Like that.
[152:24.76]It needs to go all the way down.
[152:28.50]It's not gonna happen.
[152:34.03]Neither is that.
[152:38.13]I could do a series of these cubes.
[152:42.71]That might work.
[152:46.01]Can I stack these?
[152:55.06]These can be stacked?
[152:56.82]Oh, they can be stacked.
[152:58.52]Done.
[152:59.04]Complete.
[153:10.41]But how do we sell the ice cream, though?
[153:13.29]How do we sell the ice cream, though?
[153:20.20]Make sure it's lined up right.
[153:21.16]It is.
[153:22.00]I'm trying to do that as we go.
[153:29.25]It was the funny joke voice.
[153:30.65]Yep.
[153:31.93]That's how you can tell.
[153:39.98]I need room to go around the counter.
[153:41.88]So now from here.
[153:42.78]Let's see.
[153:47.56]Cutting board.
[153:49.18]Laundry basket.
[153:50.92]Small green box.
[153:51.80]Okay, here are the ice creams, right?
[153:53.04]Candles?
[153:55.94]What if I just sell Bibles?
[153:57.17]No, it's going to have to be these.
[153:58.31]The candles.
[154:03.28]You know how they have the sizes up there?
[154:05.98]This is the size.
[154:07.84]No, these are the ice creams.
[154:10.53]This is to show you how they look.
[154:12.97]Got raspberry.
[154:14.85]Blue raspberry.
[154:16.17]Banana.
[154:18.07]Strawberry.
[154:20.99]And... This is strawberry.
[154:24.18]This is strawberry, you idiot.
[154:26.08]Stupid Jeremy.
[154:26.82]That's strawberry.
[154:32.79]I know.
[154:32.97]It's going to be moved.
[154:33.57]Don't worry.
[154:34.71]It's going to be fine.
[154:39.13]Need a... God damn it.
[154:44.86]This is way better.
[154:50.96]God damn it!
[155:06.64]And can I make it... Can I make it blue?
[155:08.62]If I can make it blue, that's even better.
[155:09.90]I can make it gray.
[155:10.90]It matches the ground.
[155:13.26]Yeah, let's make it gray.
[155:20.47]It's perfect.
[155:23.07]Look at that.
[155:24.55]So much better.
[155:31.97]Should I give people an opportunity to wash their hands?
[155:35.89]There's the ice cream.
[155:37.11]That's where the ice cream comes out of.
[155:38.83]That's what you don't understand.
[155:40.95]See, right here is where the ice cream, you pull the lever.
[155:43.65]This is not a sink.
[155:44.65]Forget that.
[155:45.13]Get that out of your mind.
[155:47.71]This is the thing.
[155:49.73]They're all stored in here, and then you have the display right here.
[155:54.32]Check it.
[155:54.64]Watch.
[155:56.04]Is this better?
[155:56.42]No.
[156:01.84]I have to make it look like there's some kind of chilling device, right?
[156:05.30]This looks like it could be an AC chill.
[156:08.58]Right?
[156:08.76]It's like the chiller.
[156:10.90]Right?
[156:11.08]Okay, good.
[156:13.74]The candles.
[156:18.43]Candles.
[156:20.67]Candle big, candle small.
[156:22.89]Look at this.
[156:23.33]Look at how perfect this is going to be.
[156:27.35]Show the flavors.
[156:28.17]We can do this one big or this one small.
[156:35.91]Big these are the sizes and the flavors I Got it that paint cans.
[156:52.32]Yeah, but the paint cans take up too much space Paint cans take up so much space.
[156:59.34]Where am I supposed to put them?
[157:00.48]Oh?
[157:08.74]Paint cans, but where are they going to go?
[157:21.02]God damn it.
[157:22.40]Am I actually going to do this?
[157:29.01]No, it is ice cream, but it has to be behind the counter.
[157:34.75]And it's... God damn it, this is perfect.
[157:36.43]You're right.
[157:38.22]They have the giant cans that sit in the thing.
[157:40.24]I still want this, though.
[157:42.28]I still want to show the sizes.
[157:47.18]You can get a small or you can get a medium.
[157:59.79]Okay, hold on.
[158:00.37]Let me just get them back here.
[158:11.24]Let's pick this up.
[158:19.52]That's better.
[158:20.32]They come upstairs leading to here and I'm going to make a little corner device and then all the flavors.
[158:29.33]How are people going to see the flavors?
[158:34.69]I don't know.
[158:35.25]There's no way.
[158:37.83]I have to put them up.
[158:40.24]I wish I could spin these.
[158:47.10]Let me take a look at some other things here.
[158:49.06]Other.
[158:52.55]I wish this was bigger.
[158:56.49]Put them on top of the blue blocks?
[159:01.80]Hold on.
[159:02.22]What about tables?
[159:03.56]Is there any table that's small enough?
[159:10.94]You know, I could just take a picture.
[159:13.80]Yeah.
[159:16.46]Oh, fuck me, man.
[159:17.84]Like, this is going to take, like, two hours.
[159:21.36]This is going to take such a long time.
[159:24.24]I can't take a picture of this and, like, put it over here.
[159:27.56]I have to do that, like, 70 times.
[159:30.98]No, I'm going to put them all... Here's what will happen.
[159:32.94]This is exactly what's happening.
[159:33.92]I'm going to put all of them down, take a picture, and post it on the front.
[159:38.38]It's going to go right here.
[159:39.72]Across this.
[159:42.26]Or on the whiteboard.
[159:42.94]Alright, I got it, got it, got it.
[159:46.84]We gotta have a clean background, though.
[159:49.62]Let's get all the paints.
[159:50.62]Fuck me, why am I doing this?
[159:53.38]This is gonna just piss everybody off, you know that, right?
[159:57.08]Nobody wants this.
[159:57.72]They're gonna be angry that there's paint on the ground still.
[160:01.82]But I need to think of what the flavors are in my brain.
[160:04.78]This is... That's not vanilla, by the way.
[160:07.10]Excuse me, guys.
[160:07.76]That is lemon-lime.
[160:10.27]That is a lemon-lime ice cream.
[160:12.03]Here's your vanilla, right?
[160:15.07]This is vanilla deep.
[160:17.43]Lemon-lime, vanilla deep.
[160:18.71]No, lemon-lime, vanilla, vanilla deep.
[160:22.27]Peach-flavored ice cream.
[160:29.56]I'm not sure what this one would be.
[160:30.56]This would be a tangerine.
[160:34.93]This one sounds like it would be... I would call this one velvety peach.
[160:37.83]It's a little more deeper, has some more vanilla put in it.
[160:41.59]Um... Pink, this is... This is strawberry.
[160:53.36]This is your typical orange sherbet.
[160:55.04]That's fine.
[160:59.28]I would not call this strawberry.
[161:00.48]I would call this raspberry.
[161:05.02]Uh, blood orange.
[161:06.74]No, that's not blood orange.
[161:09.26]This is blood orange.
[161:11.26]So what is this one then?
[161:12.70]I don't like how these are set up.
[161:13.66]Yeah, that could be mango.
[161:28.21]Mango and then blood and then orange.
[161:30.75]Or sherbet.
[161:31.23]Sherbet and mango.
[161:33.25]And then you have strawberry.
[161:38.32]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[161:39.16]Excuse me.
[161:39.58]Cheesecake.
[161:41.26]Cheesecake.
[161:42.86]Strawberry.
[161:43.94]Blood orange.
[161:53.40]Hold on.
[161:53.70]It's coming.
[161:59.84]Hold on.
[162:00.12]It's coming.
[162:00.42]No, I'm not looking at chat.
[162:01.98]Um...
[162:04.35]What is that?
[162:08.36]Oh, fuck me.
[162:09.20]Come on.
[162:09.62]I've seen it before and I've eaten it before.
[162:12.06]Birthday cake.
[162:13.66]Birthday cake ice cream is right there.
[162:19.02]Pistachio?
[162:21.32]No, wait.
[162:21.60]This is pistachio.
[162:24.42]Yep.
[162:24.77]Okay, hold on.
[162:25.27]Pistachios goes down here.
[162:26.33]This is gonna go up.
[162:30.53]This is vanilla deep.
[162:31.61]So this is vanilla, this is vanilla, vanilla bean.
[162:34.31]Here's pistachio.
[162:35.01]Pistachio can come down here.
[162:43.16]Coffee.
[162:44.00]Flavored ice cream.
[162:46.94]Now, god damn, this is pistachio.
[162:48.71]Here's pistachio.
[162:51.25]Here's coffee.
[163:01.02]All right, so then this would be... If this is pistachio, that means this is mint.
[163:05.96]That's mint.
[163:09.10]That's not... Excuse me, that's not mint chocolate chip.
[163:10.86]There's no chocolate chips in there.
[163:11.88]That's mint.
[163:17.07]This is what we're going at.
[163:18.15]This is... I would call this cotton candy, but cotton candy is blue.
[163:21.61]So, excuse me, that's not correct.
[163:23.45]This would be Rocky Road.
[163:27.81]There's your Rocky Road, and here is...
[163:31.49]Whew.
[163:33.25]That is pretty close.
[163:39.99]Cotton Candy's blue.
[163:44.62]Black Raspberry.
[163:46.12]Black Raspberry, that's fine.
[163:47.32]But are you sure about that, guys?
[163:48.64]Because you're about to get a very, very hard decision for Black Raspberry.
[163:52.06]What about down here?
[163:54.38]Are you sure this... You didn't think I had Black Raspberry in mind?
[163:58.87]So this is not black raspberry, but this is.
[164:01.05]Excu- Okay.
[164:04.20]That's not grape.
[164:04.94]There's no grape-flavored ice cream.
[164:08.00]What grape-flavored ice cream is there?
[164:09.88]There's no grape?
[164:14.84]No, this is... This is... Hold on a minute.
[164:22.79]What is it?
[164:24.23]Purple ice creams.
[164:25.53]What is it called?
[164:34.88]It has a specific name.
[164:40.30]Purple, purple yams?
[164:42.18]No, it's not a yam.
[164:43.08]What are you talking about, video?
[164:43.98]Alright, I don't want to screw up my flavors here.
[164:49.46]And I gotta get them in the right color order too.
[164:52.44]So we got black raspberry.
[164:56.96]No, you... God damn it.
[165:01.10]Move out of the way.
[165:04.11]Blue... Okay.
[165:05.19]Blueberry.
[165:07.25]Blueberry.
[165:08.37]Black raspberry.
[165:13.34]Alright.
[165:13.84]That's good so far.
[165:16.58]What was this one?
[165:17.24]I forgot.
[165:20.20]Caramel would not... Caramel would be more of a brown color, I would say.
[165:28.45]There we go.
[165:30.56]So this one was, so that's blueberry, black raspberry, eggplant.
[165:38.53]No, this was... I don't remember what that was.
[165:45.43]We have so, there's so many flavors here.
[165:46.95]We gotta, we gotta get rid of some of these flavors.
[165:49.35]There's too many.
[165:52.99]Why does it matter what they're called?
[165:54.01]You can't label them.
[165:54.95]You know, you're right, but you have to give them names.
[165:59.99]Alright, well this is fine.
[166:00.90]It's already named for us.
[166:08.04]There's like three different pistachios.
[166:10.46]There's your cotton candy.
[166:16.05]Eggplant flavored ice cream.
[166:19.87]That's like s'mores.
[166:22.42]That's the color of the s'mores ice cream.
[166:30.84]Now we're getting into chocolate territory.
[166:40.88]We have to eliminate some of these.
[166:43.54]We have to pick the best ones.
[166:48.77]There's too many of these.
[166:50.91]This is never going to work.
[166:53.49]No, no, no.
[166:55.65]That's it.
[166:56.43]Now we have to process elimination.
[167:00.01]No, no, no, we're taking a picture.
[167:01.25]We're taking a picture.
[167:01.78]What am I doing?
[167:02.26]Taking a picture.
[167:02.80]I got it.
[167:05.28]What was the last one?
[167:05.98]This blue?
[167:13.84]That's good enough.
[167:14.94]It doesn't matter.
[167:16.24]Charcoal.
[167:19.58]I know I have to move him around.
[167:22.78]Hold on.
[167:24.26]This is all for the photo, guys.
[167:25.90]Remember.
[167:33.46]Needs to be in the right spot.
[167:37.90]That's fine right there.
[167:43.58]Yeah, those of you that have no idea what the hell's going on, we're making an ice cream store and need to have flavors.
[167:50.05]So I have to take a picture of all the flavors on the ground and then post it on a poster on the wall and on the front.
[168:05.38]Selling paint as ice cream.
[168:08.32]Oh, you get what you pay for.
[168:09.28]Okay.
[168:30.05]Because I want the... I don't want the... There we go.
[168:35.90]Can I get a medium paint?
[168:40.94]This will all be worth it in the end.
[168:42.70]Trust me.
[168:49.83]And then we're going to delete some of these.
[168:50.83]We're going to have a couple back here, though, for the aesthetic.
[168:56.15]And by the way, none of this matters.
[168:58.51]Nothing I'm doing right now matters at all.
[169:02.89]This is actually decreasing the value of the house.
[169:06.33]but it's what we're doing.
[169:12.29]Almost done.
[169:13.61]And we can be out of this nightmare, I promise.
[169:27.53]Yeah, we serve it in three sizes.
[169:31.91]Brush, roller,
[169:35.01]And spray can.
[169:37.49]What would you like yours in?
[169:43.49]It's not... I fixed it.
[169:44.43]It's not uneven.
[169:46.55]This one is, but it's alright.
[169:47.79]I'll fix it.
[169:52.23]It's not misaligned.
[169:53.15]That's perfect.
[169:54.51]There's nothing wrong with it at all.
[170:01.49]The chocolate's misaligned.
[170:03.83]I got it.
[170:04.39]Everything's good.
[170:05.91]There's no charcoal flavor.
[170:07.35]Get it out of here.
[170:08.01]Take the picture.
[170:08.59]Let's go.
[170:09.23]Be done with this.
[170:09.85]That's pretty good right there.
[170:37.29]All right, let's do it.
[170:43.72]Picture, right?
[170:46.06]Pictures and paintings.
[170:49.90]Gallery.
[170:54.06]What is this?
[170:57.68]Okay.
[171:00.84]So it needs to be very long.
[171:04.81]How high does this need to be?
[171:17.17]I can't put it on the front?
[171:18.05]I don't think I can put it on the front here.
[171:28.52]I can't put it on the front of this.
[171:34.30]Put it on the floor.
[171:35.25]I can't put it on the floor.
[171:36.25]I can't put it on the ceiling.
[171:37.19]It has to go over here.
[171:56.43]higher and less wide that's too big though isn't it you need the whiteboard for the prices you know that's correct so that's true this needs to shrink and shrink
[172:26.00]So right here, and then the whiteboard.
[172:31.33]Not a bad picture.
[172:32.09]Hey, thanks.
[172:32.51]All right, now the whiteboard comes out.
[172:44.20]Come on, get it.
[172:44.68]Where's the whiteboard?
[172:49.48]Whiteboard.
[172:49.84]I think that's a little too high.
[172:56.62]Should it be the other way around?
[172:57.46]I think it should be the other way around.
[173:09.68]And there are all your flavors.
[173:10.70]Alright, look at that.
[173:12.66]That's much better.
[173:14.66]You look up here.
[173:16.50]And look, it doesn't have to be perfect.
[173:18.44]We don't even have to have names on here.
[173:19.60]It could just be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, all the way through.
[173:22.16]Like, can I have 9, please?
[173:26.10]You know when you go to a lot of Chinese food restaurants and you pick up the menu and it's very, very efficient.
[173:32.81]I wish more places would do this.
[173:34.45]It's just, I'll take a 16, please.
[173:37.03]And they're like, okay, yeah.
[173:37.99]They know exactly what you're talking about.
[173:43.14]Now, can I get a small 41 spicy?
[173:46.72]Okay.
[173:50.44]Now we have to keep the colorful ones here.
[173:57.21]I say let's keep the vanilla.
[174:03.37]Keep vanilla.
[174:06.65]This one.
[174:11.39]Keep an orange, maybe.
[174:12.28]No, let's keep the blood orange, the deep orange there.
[174:16.28]Keep the pistachio.
[174:20.08]Pistachio and mint, maybe.
[174:21.36]No.
[174:22.84]Get rid of this one.
[174:23.40]Let's keep the coffee, the chocolate.
[174:27.52]There we go.
[174:28.48]Cotton candy.
[174:29.84]The rest of you get... I fucked up.
[174:31.44]It's okay.
[174:31.74]That could be chocolate.
[174:34.82]Alright.
[174:35.02]Give it a gray.
[174:38.14]Alright.
[174:38.42]That's... This is... Okay.
[174:40.40]That's good.
[174:40.68]That's enough flavors.
[174:43.04]Now I'm going to put them up somewhere.
[174:46.48]This is just for display purposes.
[174:47.84]This is only just... Just for us.
[174:53.99]R.I.P.
[174:54.25]the banana ice cream.
[174:58.09]You know, I like this a lot.
[174:59.35]I like this a lot.
[175:02.29]Just take a look at that.
[175:02.93]Just this portion here, right here.
[175:05.35]Where are those blue blocks?
[175:14.85]How big are these?
[175:16.91]That's an other, right?
[175:22.29]This is how it should be done.
[175:23.31]Can I put them on a shelf?
[175:24.57]No.
[175:28.58]Ball.
[175:29.52]Green.
[175:29.96]No, there's nothing else I can stick it on, right?
[175:36.43]Yeah, we can do this.
[175:38.17]This can be the thing that they come look at and they go, okay, cool, whoa.
[175:45.66]How much is that one?
[175:46.44]Oh, I like that one.
[175:47.20]Can I taste that one?
[175:48.00]These are the most popular flavors.
[175:53.44]I hate this game.
[175:55.10]I fucking hate this game.
[175:56.01]You can't do it.
[176:04.77]It's just gonna... I can't... Honestly, I don't think I can set them anywhere but the ground.
[176:07.95]So we're just gonna have to put them on the ground.
[176:13.01]This is just for us, because the employee has to get the ice cream from somewhere.
[176:17.38]And these are the popular flavors that are just out.
[176:23.24]You know, sometimes if you order one of the fucked up ones that nobody likes, they have to go in the back to get it.
[176:27.90]Same deal.
[176:36.90]Okay, that's fine.
[176:37.80]I don't like this, though.
[176:41.76]This has to change right now.
[176:43.81]And I mean right.
[176:44.91]Right now.
[176:46.61]I like it back here.
[176:49.51]But it's not big enough.
[176:53.39]I really do like it there, though.
[176:54.53]I feel like it's just too big.
[176:59.15]Flush with the wall from over here.
[177:05.01]Because then you can look at the flavors.
[177:06.75]Yeah, because then you can take a look over here and you get to order.
[177:08.89]It's right there.
[177:09.67]That's better.
[177:12.93]Can I take your order, please?
[177:14.43]Yep, you sure can.
[177:19.73]And this can come up here.
[177:21.83]Because not only do we have hard ice cream here, we've got the soft serve as well.
[177:26.86]So this is the perfect spot.
[177:30.70]They're going to melt?
[177:31.62]No, that's what this is for.
[177:33.02]That's why we suck out all the humidity and put in the cool air.
[177:41.91]Put the cans on top of the shelf.
[177:43.09]They can only go on the ground.
[177:46.13]Paint cans can only be on the ground.
[177:49.49]Here are your sizes.
[177:58.58]I can fix this later if need be.
[178:01.94]Just want to get it in the right spot.
[178:03.68]That's a little, that's better.
[178:06.24]I will get it cleaner.
[178:07.62]Don't worry.
[178:08.08]And then over here, a little, a little gate or something has to go here.
[178:18.35]Oh, are you kidding me?
[178:20.89]Are you being serious right now?
[178:22.75]Really?
[178:23.73]This is the employee area.
[178:24.87]Let's just put a wall here.
[178:27.45]That's so much easier.
[178:35.13]With a door.
[178:44.16]Employees only.
[178:51.47]What the hell was I thinking?
[178:56.57]And you all hated this.
[178:57.97]Everybody hated this.
[178:59.23]Until now you get to see it.
[179:01.15]In real life.
[179:07.61]How the employee's gonna get in?
[179:08.80]Right here.
[179:09.10]I'm gonna put a door right here.
[179:11.00]Should I just put a slider?
[179:14.06]I never hated it.
[179:16.22]Somebody, like, this is somebody's... This is not even my idea.
[179:20.14]Somebody just... Like, I... No, actually, you know what it was.
[179:22.97]I said ice cream store.
[179:26.25]And then somebody said use the paint cans.
[179:28.03]So, like, thanks for... Thanks for saving this house.
[179:31.37]It was a collaborative effort.
[179:36.38]Alright, uh...
[179:41.38]door can't fit there it needs to be a little bigger okay let's uh white door yeah oh come on get out of the way hydra I've got a I gotta get one I'm good hey there's still a bug in it but it still works
[180:08.00]Okay, that's fine.
[180:08.74]Is that done?
[180:09.44]Get out of the way, please.
[180:10.94]Don't do this to me right now.
[180:15.54]Clear.
[180:25.15]Good.
[180:28.49]Make it blue like the walls?
[180:29.86]It's going to match the ground.
[180:37.57]Let's fill this in and then we're going to fill in with paint.
[180:42.27]This is considered a bathroom.
[180:51.96]Welcome to the bathroom.
[180:53.84]Yep.
[180:56.99]Why open the door when you can slide over the counter?
[180:58.59]Yeah, but you can't do that.
[180:59.47]That's illegal.
[181:01.75]Are you going to jump the counter at your local ice cream shop?
[181:05.25]Are you going to go to Ben and Jerry's and jump over the counter?
[181:08.48]No, that's illegal.
[181:09.80]You can even do this too.
[181:15.92]I wonder if this will look better as well.
[181:23.21]What do you think?
[181:23.63]Is that worse?
[181:25.51]That goes all the way across?
[181:27.67]So it should be open.
[181:39.09]Oh, fuck!
[181:52.32]Where do you think that whiteboard's going now?
[181:54.02]Where do you think the painting's going now?
[181:56.20]Right up there.
[182:11.36]Now this has got to come out further, doesn't it?
[182:14.78]Yeah, this has got to jut out like a foot.
[182:18.09]So people can stand back here and see.
[182:27.71]What do you mean, no?
[182:30.28]Demolition skill.
[182:31.88]Faster demolition.
[182:32.66]More muscle strength.
[182:33.90]Faster demolition.
[182:36.78]What do you mean, no?
[182:37.20]No?
[182:37.26]What do you mean, no?
[182:38.08]What are you talking about?
[182:39.76]It needs to extend.
[182:43.22]There are no people in this game.
[182:44.24]I'm making them up.
[182:47.76]I'm creating a fantasy that doesn't exist.
[182:51.72]It's going to come over the counter.
[182:52.82]It's going to come maybe one or two leagues over the counter.
[183:00.78]Like out here.
[183:03.96]One, two, right, I'd say right here, right here.
[183:11.50]And then across from here.
[183:14.28]That looks perfect, actually.
[183:25.95]Too much?
[183:26.43]Too much?
[183:26.83]I don't think it's too much.
[183:30.17]I need to see it in full view, though.
[183:38.05]One too much?
[183:40.57]Is it, though?
[183:43.30]Let's pull back one.
[183:57.75]By the way, this is all upstairs.
[184:04.49]That is one too far.
[184:15.25]You just ate paint?
[184:16.95]I'm sorry to hear that.
[184:20.40]Get to a doctor.
[184:21.04]I don't know why I'm not doing the right... Change the building method.
[184:30.76]It's cute.
[184:31.44]Here we go.
[184:31.94]Like, honest to goodness, man.
[184:35.70]Could build three of these at a time.
[184:45.86]So I've got a very, very big question.
[184:51.17]How much can I sell this for?
[184:52.71]Sorry, I get a little bit of the money back.
[184:57.75]How much did I buy that for?
[184:59.29]Like $2,000?
[184:59.49]$3,000?
[185:00.49]She hates that I deleted that.
[185:07.94]Let me get that.
[185:09.92]That's better.
[185:18.34]That looks alright.
[185:19.22]That looks okay.
[185:22.30]Now, paint it blue.
[185:25.98]Do I have any blue paint left over?
[185:27.16]You know what?
[185:27.96]I got blue paint back there.
[185:29.98]Is it the right?
[185:30.44]I don't think it's the right one, though.
[185:33.12]No, it's not.
[185:36.06]So this has got to be blue as well.
[185:38.74]Maybe there should be a different color blue in here.
[185:42.55]What do you think?
[185:43.45]Should that be a teal or something?
[185:45.27]Or should I stay the uniform you're in probably Ben & Jerry's right now?
[185:57.62]White works through this.
[185:58.56]White just works too, doesn't it?
[186:03.84]Let me put the picture up there first.
[186:06.46]I need to see it.
[186:22.88]It's a little bit just barely too big.
[186:25.42]There we go.
[186:43.23]So then this needs to be here or here and then the whiteboard to the right.
[186:51.07]Maybe I should just have it just like this.
[186:52.71]Let's just put it there and look.
[186:57.57]Because I think the whiteboard might take over this.
[187:01.31]Whiteboard might just have to stay here.
[187:07.18]Stretch it all the way across.
[187:08.26]But then you can't even see it.
[187:10.20]I'll center it.
[187:10.94]Hold on.
[187:18.58]The whiteboard vertical?
[187:19.48]Let's give that a try.
[187:29.01]Nah, it's too long.
[187:32.49]I think I actually do, I like the whiteboard here.
[187:36.69]Because then you can come up with, oh, look at all the flavors!
[187:38.93]There they are!
[187:39.39]And then, oh, here's their prices.
[187:51.78]Put a whiteboard on either side.
[187:53.06]I think that clutters it up a little too much.
[188:04.88]I like it.
[188:07.66]I like it.
[188:12.69]Here's the ice cream server.
[188:13.71]This is your sizes.
[188:14.57]Something else has to go up here.
[188:16.95]Can't just be barren like that.
[188:25.72]Of course.
[188:27.64]Of course they sell water here.
[188:29.61]Why wouldn't they?
[188:30.29]This is a store.
[188:31.65]They sell bottles of water.
[188:35.75]They sell...
[188:42.08]Uh, you're gonna get a peanut butter, if you want peanut butter on, the con, yeah, peanut butter, sprinkles, here, okay, here we go, got it.
[188:50.14]Peanut butter, no, this doesn't work, I was gonna say sprinkles.
[188:52.79]Rice is not technically, can't, doesn't look that, anything like that.
[188:56.01]But this is, oh my god, this looks like fucking ice cream stuff, doesn't it?
[189:00.99]There's nuts, there's your grenadine.
[189:06.12]There's, whatever the hell you want to make, have this be.
[189:11.08]Look at that.
[189:12.72]Make it cleaner.
[189:13.58]Hold on.
[189:14.38]Get the peanut butter out of here.
[189:15.34]Fuck this thing.
[189:16.64]It looks terrible.
[189:17.68]That looks better.
[189:20.18]So you've got sprinkles, nuts.
[189:23.56]But this has to be over here, though.
[189:24.72]No, this is the line.
[189:27.04]If you want condiments, if you want ice cream condiments, you've got to come over here.
[189:32.67]This is a little condiment station.
[189:35.79]Little crystallized sugar, peanuts...
[189:40.28]Limes or... It doesn't have to be pickles.
[189:44.10]It can just be whatever you want.
[189:53.83]Pineapple?
[189:54.37]That could be pineapple.
[189:54.97]You can just pretend it's pineapple.
[189:58.81]I think that's good for that.
[190:00.15]That's cute.
[190:06.99]Come on.
[190:08.61]It's the safe.
[190:10.79]Alright, now we just need to do tables.
[190:12.59]Because this is where the line will be.
[190:15.13]Gotta have a table here.
[190:19.85]And then, let's get rid of this.
[190:23.46]I need to wall this up, because this has to actually be a bathroom.
[190:27.48]Or, I mean, can I just get rid of the bathroom?
[190:29.48]Why does it have to be a bathroom?
[190:30.70]I can just get rid of all this stuff and put a table over here.
[190:41.31]I gotta paint this or do I just paint it up to here yeah gotta be consistent what the hell is this thing called ice blue
[191:09.46]I'm still playing this fucked up game.
[191:13.32]Yeah, I... Did I go too far?
[191:15.66]No, that's fine.
[191:20.25]Something else has to be back here, though.
[191:23.63]Look, just add it to the ice cream flavors.
[191:28.17]Perfect.
[191:31.74]My little ice cream store.
[191:39.45]Looking good.
[191:39.89]Some shelves.
[191:43.11]Yeah.
[191:44.37]Let me close this off, though, because there does have to be a bathroom up here.
[191:47.93]Otherwise, this whole room is a bathroom and it's just the whole thing's ruined.
[191:51.41]So let me get that situated.
[191:58.27]Make this a little bit bigger.
[192:02.37]What are you doing here, dude?
[192:05.82]There you go.
[192:07.80]What am I going to do about parking?
[192:10.72]You walk to this place.
[192:13.08]Or you ride your bike.
[192:23.45]Out of the way.
[192:29.99]Make it a bathroom.
[192:30.58]I'm making a bathroom right now.
[192:41.10]I have to connect to this wall.
[192:43.47]No ifs, ands, or buts.
[192:45.11]I have no building skill, apparently.
[192:52.07]Whatever it is.
[192:54.29]Five walls at once, or I can build a distance more.
[192:57.37]Whatever.
[192:57.73]Five walls.
[192:58.37]I'm going to have to put the tile down and paint this wall.
[193:07.86]God.
[193:08.74]Oh, shit.
[193:09.22]How do I get in here?
[193:14.33]Well, I guess it could be right here.
[193:17.99]The door could be right here.
[193:18.71]Yeah, the door will be on this side.
[193:27.24]Should it though?
[193:27.82]I feel like, no, I don't like the fact that it's door, door.
[193:29.88]No, the door's going to be on this side.
[193:33.40]Right here.
[193:41.56]You need to parkour to get to the door.
[193:42.94]No, you're just going to come up the stairs.
[193:47.41]I really should put a wall here, too.
[193:48.93]No, but there needs to be a table here.
[193:51.73]Table.
[193:53.23]Table.
[193:56.21]A little... Yeah, that's it.
[193:57.57]And then it'll be done up here.
[194:05.96]You're going to get a lawsuit if you don't have a wall?
[194:09.50]We're fine.
[194:10.85]Just watch.
[194:13.41]It's so funny that I actually don't give a shit about anything that's going on downstairs.
[194:18.64]Can I just take a giant house knife and just slash, slice through the house and then pull the bottom out and bang!
[194:28.90]Have this land on the ground?
[194:30.94]Why can't I do that?
[194:38.03]Door.
[194:40.77]Also keep these consistent.
[194:46.81]Fuck, I need another hammer here.
[194:53.02]That's not good.
[194:54.62]Neither is that.
[194:55.34]This is bad.
[194:56.14]The door has to be over here.
[194:58.90]Damn it.
[194:59.22]No, I don't want the door over there, though.
[195:00.66]I don't want that.
[195:03.00]I don't want the door over there.

[196:55.92]There'd be a clothing store electronic store And an ice cream store well there you go.
[197:02.80]I just made them all We're gonna have an electronic store downstairs at like a clothing store or bookstore or something furniture store Yeah, bathroom store
[197:21.98]We can actually do a lot of that stuff.
[197:23.50]I took out all the supports and everything downstairs.
[197:25.53]Alright, close this up.
[197:28.49]Paint this stupid wall.
[197:30.53]Blah.
[197:30.83]I'm not done with up here yet, though.
[197:38.42]Why can't I put anything there?
[197:45.32]Here we go.
[197:47.94]So is this still... Okay, this is not a bathroom anymore.
[197:50.42]This is room 50M2.
[197:51.18]Alright.
[197:55.58]Finish this later.
[197:57.56]You thought I was kidding when I was going to make this house?
[197:59.68]It was going to take me like seven and a half hours to make it?
[198:03.13]That was not a joke.
[198:04.65]This is still happening.
[198:07.81]Sell the tub?
[198:09.69]No, that's worth money.
[198:11.41]Alright, paint.
[198:11.69]Paint.
[198:17.56]Oh no, I already have it back there.
[198:20.08]Let's get a dip into the ice cream.
[198:22.32]There it is.
[198:22.72]Okay.
[198:31.24]It's an ice cream shop.
[198:33.80]Dude, the ice cream shop has to have a bathroom.
[198:37.68]And hey, look, if somebody wants to, that's like a changing table.
[198:40.78]If somebody, no, that's a wrong flavor.
[198:43.24]Give me this.
[198:48.06]If somebody wants to take a bath in there, whatever.
[198:49.78]Anybody want ice cream?
[198:57.69]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[198:59.51]Just order me a small rocky road.
[199:02.83]I'm going to take a bath.
[199:04.79]I'll be back in 10 minutes.
[199:19.12]You serve... You serve ice cream to the customers with a roller by painting their faces.
[199:28.32]You want blue raspberry?
[199:30.24]Alright, here you go.
[199:31.76]Here you go, ma'am.
[199:33.54]Oh, fuck.
[199:34.02]I screwed that up.
[199:39.31]Shit.
[199:40.35]No!
[199:40.85]What do I do about that?
[199:45.69]Ah, I need white.
[199:46.47]I need lemon-lime.
[199:52.32]Who takes a 10 minute bath?
[199:53.80]What do you mean who takes a 10 minute?
[199:56.52]How long do you take a... How long do you sit in the bath for?
[199:58.74]And you sit in the bathtub for an hour.
[200:10.05]I do not believe that.
[200:11.23]Are you kidding me?
[200:11.89]You're going to turn into a raisin.
[200:16.28]That's so bad.
[200:18.45]No, you're gonna, like, retain water.
[200:20.01]Go in the bathtub for, like, 15 minutes.
[200:26.30]Alright, we'll figure this out later.
[200:28.98]This needs to be painted right here.
[200:32.10]Or does it?
[200:32.56]No, this... I don't know.
[200:35.66]Should I paint this blue, or should I leave this white?
[200:44.83]No, that's good.
[200:47.64]Let's get some tables in here.
[200:48.56]What do you say?
[200:51.78]The white table.
[200:53.64]No, that's a goofy table.
[200:54.64]I don't like it.
[200:56.74]Round table with round auto.
[200:58.93]No.
[201:02.87]Actually, ice cream shops do have... They have these circle tables.
[201:08.47]They do.
[201:12.20]This is pine, though.
[201:15.87]No, this doesn't fit.
[201:17.59]Does this fit with what I'm working with here?
[201:19.31]I don't like that.
[201:20.91]That doesn't fit.
[201:23.57]It's the right idea, but I don't like it.
[201:35.44]No, I don't like this either.
[201:37.29]It has to be white.
[201:41.27]Any more circle tables?
[201:43.49]Does this have to be blue?
[201:45.48]There we go.
[201:52.86]This is not... Kids aren't allowed in my house.
[201:55.18]Get out of here.
[202:00.47]One of these.
[202:02.47]This is a little bit better.
[202:04.43]No, it's not.
[202:05.05]We're going to have to deal with the other one.
[202:10.30]What about this?
[202:10.72]That's a stool.
[202:16.53]The auto, this is the, that's the closest thing I can get here.
[202:38.51]I hate this.
[202:39.51]No, I don't like this.
[202:51.31]No, I don't, it ruined it.
[202:52.58]This is ruined.
[202:53.78]Is it ruined?
[202:54.36]No, it's not.
[202:54.84]It's okay.
[202:56.90]Put this in the corner.
[203:05.20]We need better lights.
[203:10.82]These lights are, burn the whole house.
[203:14.96]I don't like, I don't like these lights.
[203:16.37]Burn it down.
[203:22.89]We have to have this lit up.
[203:27.73]I want a new one.
[203:28.67]I don't want to do it anymore.
[203:31.37]These windows are all clean, right?
[203:34.02]How is there light coming out of here?
[203:35.38]This is a whack job in there, it seems.
[203:39.36]Even the door is closed.
[203:40.40]How is light coming out of here?
[203:47.49]Okay.
[203:51.17]No, no.
[203:51.93]Whack.
[203:53.04]whack job.
[203:56.68]I'm going to go with lights.
[204:02.39]We need lights.
[204:05.13]No lamps.
[204:05.67]It's all going to be up in the ceiling.
[204:08.47]So I would say I mean, we need probably fluorescent up here.
[204:22.24]I can't put it up here?
[204:23.12]Why?
[204:23.34]Oh, come on.
[204:24.98]Really?
[204:32.93]That has to be a scary ice cream shop.
[204:36.27]No.
[204:42.41]Why can't I put this here?
[204:45.65]No, that looks shitty.
[204:49.47]That looks bad, too.
[204:55.44]Light it up by candlelight.
[204:58.05]It's got to be fluorescence.
[204:59.07]It has to be, right?
[205:03.21]They need to be in decent places, though.
[205:06.17]Why can't I just put them on the ceiling?
[205:09.63]Do I not have a light switch in this whole entire house?
[205:21.05]Yeah, the employee light's right there.
[205:23.76]Oh, fuck.
[205:24.16]That's technically a different room.
[205:25.94]Okay, well... Right here.
[205:34.36]There we go.
[205:34.78]Okay.
[205:39.27]Let's get a few of these.
[205:50.89]He spent four hours in...
[205:54.53]Lamps, maybe?
[205:55.21]Do I want... No, no lamps.
[205:56.37]Lamps are terrible.
[206:00.70]Flower.
[206:04.00]The customer isn't going to turn the light on enough?
[206:06.82]It's alright.
[206:09.22]What about hanging shelf?
[206:11.88]No, I hate it.
[206:15.63]One there.
[206:17.25]One like every... Hmm...
[206:24.98]Who turned it off?
[206:26.62]I didn't turn it off.
[206:37.76]There are customers fucking with me here.
[207:14.98]Shit!
[207:21.82]You gotta have to go with the recessed lighting.
[207:23.34]Just have to put more of them.
[207:27.60]This looks like a dance club.
[207:28.98]Looks like a bar.
[207:31.99]Where's my recessed lights?
[207:34.07]Ceiling lights.
[207:37.31]Halogen, halogen.
[207:40.79]I mean, I could do...
[207:44.31]Let's see how these look.
[207:45.99]This is pretty ice cream shop looking, don't you think?
[207:52.23]Turn it on.
[207:55.75]No, no chandelier.
[208:02.12]Stop.
[208:03.14]Get your kids to stop turning the light off.
[208:24.22]chandelier no it's gonna have to just be the halogens I think cubes might be all right let's see how these drop down pretty low no that's ugly stay with the halogens just need to put a couple more of them and space them out better let's do one let's do one two three right here I'll fix them don't worry is the ceiling gonna stay white I don't think you can paint the ceiling
[208:55.31]I'm pretty sure you can't paint the ceiling.
[209:00.56]By the way, it is dark, right?
[209:02.50]It's not... This is not a... I'm not going to be open at 1 o'clock in the morning.
[209:28.15]That ain't perfect.
[209:28.90]I'll fix it.
[209:29.30]Don't worry.
[209:34.70]That's better.
[209:35.86]It's causing me a ton of anxiety, but I can't fix it right now.
[209:38.02]Hold on.
[209:44.57]I don't know why this is causing me so much anguish.
[209:50.25]Okay.
[209:50.85]That's fine.
[209:52.98]Close enough.
[209:56.17]just need a couple over here let's do it down this way down like the stairs actually you need like two here and then a few here heading down the stairs
[210:27.75]How am I too far away?
[210:49.72]Now it's not perfect.
[210:54.23]And it never will be.
[210:58.14]I just can't look at it right now.
[211:01.99]I can't look at it right now.
[211:02.81]I need a light switch.
[211:24.88]Here we go.
[211:25.38]Alright, that's okay.
[211:26.10]Just don't look at the ceiling and don't have a panic attack like I am.
[211:30.50]I like it.
[211:31.28]Just need lights in here.
[211:32.04]Remember, this is the employee room.
[211:35.80]This is different.
[211:39.12]So you could probably do something a little different in here.
[211:42.07]What about the little mini ones?
[211:44.27]How do those look in here?
[211:57.67]Okay.
[211:59.72]Oh!
[211:59.94]Now we're all lit up.
[212:03.02]That's fine.
[212:04.10]Fridge.
[212:04.72]Fridge.
[212:05.90]Safe.
[212:07.72]It's a standing icicle for the employee.
[212:09.38]The employee has to stand over here.
[212:12.80]And you can come over here and just put your fucking elbows down.
[212:16.03]We need stools.
[212:25.51]Black stools?
[212:26.37]Black stools?
[212:30.99]I think so.
[212:31.99]What do you think?
[212:43.65]Everyone's saying no.
[212:44.47]No, what do you mean no?
[212:45.23]What do you mean no?
[213:01.43]Alright.
[213:03.56]Wait.
[213:04.06]No, but they're... No, it's ruined.
[213:06.80]It's all ruined.
[213:08.12]It has to be.
[213:08.72]Look at that.
[213:09.52]What's with the brown on top?
[213:17.52]What the hell, man?
[213:24.54]God damn it.
[213:25.34]I can't... Don't mean they're too high.
[213:30.22]Now they're too low.
[213:35.78]I think we might have to deal with it here.
[213:38.16]I gotta put some brown on the wall or on the ground.
[213:41.29]How can I make it so this matches?
[213:42.63]I need brown on the wall.
[213:48.49]I'm gonna have to stay with black.
[214:00.16]Let's see how this looks.
[214:03.34]Actually, that's okay.
[214:04.14]I'm just looking at it.
[214:05.27]That's fine.
[214:09.87]Yeah, that's alright.
[214:10.85]I'm okay with this.
[214:20.26]Alright, nice.
[214:24.02]Yes, and I'll put a tiny stool for when you have a kid.
[214:29.65]over here there now everybody can be happy okay good hey kids aren't allowed in my house I told you I don't have kids okay oh there's so much work to be done look at this this is so much work left to be done oh my god we haven't even started any of this
[215:01.06]Alright, calm down.
[215:02.52]I need to turn some lights on.
[215:06.70]What happened to the switches?
[215:19.85]Give me a switch.
[215:27.51]So, this is the...
[215:32.60]I could do, like, somebody said put a bowling alley in the garage here.
[215:36.62]I could do that.
[215:38.02]That's easy.
[215:40.34]Yeah, that's simple.
[215:42.52]So this is, I need to map this out.
[215:44.00]Bowling alley here.
[215:44.84]Hmm.
[215:51.99]This could be two stores, though.
[215:56.39]Bowling alley...
[215:59.53]Over here is, this is going to be the electronics store.
[216:04.64]This will be the furniture store.
[216:10.80]Someone just said sell the house for fuck's sake.
[216:15.40]I can't do that right now.
[216:18.00]Do you understand?
[216:18.53]I can't do that.
[216:26.85]What the hell is this?
[216:31.93]Fix the bathroom?
[216:33.29]Don't worry, I will.
[216:34.59]We're not done.
[216:38.61]This is supposed to be a bathroom.
[216:41.91]But we already have a bathroom upstairs.
[216:45.02]Sell it?
[216:45.50]What do you mean sell it?
[216:50.12]No, I want to do this.
[216:51.10]I'm not done.
[216:51.66]Alright, we're going to do this much faster than the ice cream store.
[216:54.30]You ready?
[216:54.58]Watch.
[216:56.55]Here's the bowling alley.
[217:07.03]I'll show you.
[217:07.85]Check it.
[217:09.11]Check it out, check it out, check it out.
[217:13.03]Floor.
[217:18.84]Floor panels and coverings.
[217:21.02]Here we go.
[217:32.87]Marks up to there.
[217:34.45]This needs to be removed.
[217:36.80]Need to make this something else.
[217:44.45]No, not carpet.
[217:47.79]Actually, it probably should be carpet.
[218:03.49]This needs to be black, I think.
[218:11.03]Start from here.
[218:13.94]It's always carpet and bowling alleys.
[218:15.48]Yeah, it is.
[218:21.24]And I'm going to build a little thing because the ball can't go, you know, on the wrong side.
[218:25.52]I'm going to put a fireplace here and then build pins.
[218:35.38]Okay, so this needs to be a little bit further out.
[218:40.86]I'm going to do this quick.
[218:42.02]What do you think I'm trying to do?
[218:57.48]Yes, this is too dark.
[218:58.36]It needs to be lighter.
[219:06.86]Put a speed run timer on.
[219:08.12]No, I don't need to time myself.
[219:09.76]I'm just going to try to do it faster because I have in my brain what I need to do.
[219:13.04]No, don't do it one by one.
[219:25.73]All right, so this has to be a little bit lighter, probably a little wider too, right?
[219:30.85]Let's see.
[219:35.03]This one's lighter.
[219:40.13]Not by very much, though.
[219:41.07]What about this one?
[219:45.07]It's too light.
[219:54.04]That's a little too... No, maybe not.
[219:55.60]Let me see what it looks like.
[219:56.88]No, that's right.
[219:57.46]Okay.
[220:07.98]This goes all the way down.
[220:11.98]This is not regulation size.
[220:13.52]Alright, so now give me the carpet again.
[220:24.69]Aren't you glad I took down every wall now?
[220:37.75]Because you don't understand.
[220:38.81]You have no idea.
[220:40.71]You have no idea.
[220:44.62]Check this.
[220:46.30]Watch this one.
[220:51.53]Hmm.
[220:52.89]These look pretty perfect to me.
[220:54.09]They need to be green.
[221:03.87]Is there any white?
[221:06.35]I don't think so.
[221:11.69]These candles, maybe the candles.
[221:14.35]These look like pins, though.
[221:18.98]The candles look like cups.
[221:20.70]These look like bowling pins.
[221:21.84]I mean, that's too perfect.
[221:24.84]Whatever.
[221:35.14]Was there a white one up top?
[221:42.34]Base.
[221:42.74]I mean, there's this one, but it has weird stuff on it.
[221:48.44]The ball just crashes into the wall.
[221:50.13]It just smashes into the... No.
[221:54.55]It's got to use the green ones.
[222:00.11]It's all good.
[222:01.15]We can use these.
[222:01.91]I need to remember how bowling works.
[222:07.03]It's one.
[222:07.49]How many in a row is it?
[222:10.75]I need to try to recreate this without fucking this up.
[222:18.61]Okay, hold on.
[222:28.42]Five rows, ten pins.
[222:31.03]There's one, and then one, two, three, right?
[222:57.24]This is going to be awkward to try to get this correct.
[223:02.87]Doesn't want to be next to each other.
[223:04.05]It's not going to work.
[223:09.41]Yes, it is.
[223:16.99]Maybe they can be.
[223:18.17]Hold on.
[223:47.45]Oh, come on.
[223:48.75]Get in there.
[223:54.76]Come on, do it.
[223:57.12]Come on, do it for me.
[224:00.00]Do it.
[224:04.39]No!
[224:06.48]Do it, please!
[224:07.58]Come on!
[224:08.38]Do it!
[224:09.35]I know you can do it.
[224:10.29]The other ones just did it.
[224:35.09]Look, alright, somebody did it when they were shit-faced, so... Alright, from far away that looks fine.
[225:18.12]It's so bad, I can't fix it.
[225:20.76]It doesn't work.
[225:22.12]When they get too close, you can't do it anymore.
[225:24.88]Actually, that's alright.
[225:26.17]I just need to pull these in.
[225:33.55]That's a little better.
[225:34.23]Come on.
[225:37.28]You really don't want me to put anything over it.
[225:38.86]You know what?
[225:39.89]It's the shadows.
[225:40.55]They're having trouble getting where the shadows are.
[225:50.37]I think that's close enough.
[226:00.87]I have too many pins.
[226:03.67]Turn off the light?
[226:05.79]No, we're gonna do a bowling light.
[226:08.01]Hold on, I've got 15 pins here?
[226:10.25]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[226:20.86]Clean the carpet.
[226:21.62]No!
[226:21.96]You want me to clean the carpet?
[226:23.26]You want an authentic bowling alley?
[226:25.30]You want clean carpets?
[226:27.68]That's not gonna happen.
[226:35.94]Yeah, we're gonna make this legit.
[226:41.70]So I need to take... I need to take some away here.
[227:03.17]Okay, let's go.
[227:07.91]Oh shit, why am I... I'm not stuck like this, am I?
[227:10.70]No.
[227:14.48]So I need 1, 2, 3, 4.
[227:15.52]And they need to be spaced out.
[227:20.66]So let's sell some of these.
[227:31.73]Okay, so now 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[227:32.69]That's better.
[227:33.33]Space them out.
[227:43.12]A little bit more.
[227:51.67]Fifteen fucking pins.
[227:55.13]Ultimate bowling.
[227:56.73]That's so funny.
[228:04.32]Come on.
[228:04.60]Even still, you're not going to let me do this shit.
[228:22.24]Stop being so wonky, please.
[228:26.60]There we go.
[228:27.18]Alright.
[228:27.60]Bowling alley is almost done.
[228:36.38]I can't make this one straight.
[228:37.66]It's not gonna happen.
[228:40.64]Doesn't matter.
[228:41.04]I can't do it.
[228:41.70]Look it.
[228:42.06]See?
[228:42.62]It doesn't matter.
[228:43.54]Like, it's either here or here.
[228:45.20]Whatever one doesn't look worse.
[228:55.53]Got it.
[228:59.09]Form a tr- I can't!
[229:00.31]Do you understand?
[229:00.99]Like, I can't move these around.
[229:02.63]The game won't let you put them anywhere.
[229:05.91]You understand?
[229:06.51]I can't do it.
[229:09.75]I can get close.
[229:14.01]It's very wonky.
[229:18.61]See?
[229:18.87]You know, I'll never get it perfect.
[229:27.78]That's as good... That's as good as it's gonna get.
[229:33.58]I don't even care.
[229:34.16]Alright, give me the ball.
[229:44.35]Good.
[229:46.31]Now let's light this up.
[229:47.65]Let's put... Actually, we need the line here.
[229:52.69]So I need... Where is it?
[229:55.83]I need those blocks.
[229:57.95]The blue blocks.
[230:06.65]You just can't fuck it up.
[230:07.84]You can't miss.
[230:10.10]You need bumper boards.
[230:11.08]Yes.
[230:13.58]Some of us aren't very good.
[230:18.64]That was an other, right?
[230:27.70]Actually, the smaller ones will work too, won't they?
[230:30.24]Okay, good.
[230:36.73]This is going to take like 30 minutes to do that.
[230:39.31]I'm sorry.
[230:40.99]I don't have that in my brain.
[230:43.51]What about the cutting board?
[230:47.11]I'm not going to go piece by piece and do that.
[230:50.48]I'm sorry.
[230:53.98]If you're dreaming, if you think I'm going to do that.
[231:30.37]That looks like a bowling alley.
[231:33.61]It does, doesn't it?
[231:34.29]With the lines on the top.
[231:35.51]It just looks like it could be.
[231:39.36]I need these, though.
[231:41.78]I have to have them.
[231:45.56]Hurry up.
[231:48.48]I'm already halfway there.
[231:52.07]So many recipes.
[231:59.66]At least I'll have a place to store my files.
[232:02.58]Hey, how come you don't have any places to store my files?
[232:06.86]Now you do.
[232:07.72]Thank you.
[232:08.44]Store them in the bowling alley.
[232:19.83]Almost done.
[232:21.55]Almost there.
[232:24.29]So close.
[232:31.06]Oh, by the way, um... Fuck selling this place.
[232:34.18]This is my house.
[232:40.91]So that's good.
[232:45.69]This house is too cool to give this to somebody.
[232:49.09]No way.
[232:52.53]Incorrect.
[232:53.04]Move it over.
[233:01.06]I can't tell.
[233:01.70]I need a level.
[233:02.48]Does anybody have a ruler in this room?
[233:10.67]I can't tell.
[233:11.29]Is that level?
[233:11.87]I can't tell.
[233:12.61]I need it.
[233:15.32]Is that in the right spot?
[233:17.20]No, is it?
[233:32.84]in the right place, but it's not in the right... Got it.
[233:49.82]Okay, we're fine.
[234:04.95]I wonder how much I would get for selling this place.
[234:08.66]I need a fireplace behind there, so it looks like it's an actual... You know, the grate that comes down and pulls the pins in.
[234:17.06]And then we're gonna light this up.
[234:22.53]I need to stop this, is what has to happen, actually.
[234:25.27]Like, I need to be done.
[234:33.68]It's one back?
[234:40.58]Shut up.
[234:41.54]What?
[234:56.45]Almost there, finally.
[235:00.55]But are we, though?
[235:06.88]Oh my god, they were right.
[235:08.84]They were right.
[235:10.16]You were right!
[235:19.42]I can see it all the way down now, too, and it hurts.
[235:22.41]I don't care.
[235:34.49]No, don't do it.
[235:37.27]You don't have to do this.
[235:39.07]You actually don't have to do this.
[236:00.33]I just need enough space to do it to one.
[236:02.75]No.
[236:03.59]It's over.
[236:04.33]Fireplace.
[236:10.19]Fireplace.
[236:13.91]Where's the fireplace?
[236:19.05]Installations?
[236:20.07]No.
[236:24.14]Excuse me.
[236:26.34]There's a bug in my face.
[236:27.26]Get out of here, dude.
[236:30.16]You get back over there and fix it.
[236:31.42]No.
[236:33.18]I refuse.
[236:33.60]I'm not going to fix it.
[236:42.15]Carpets.
[236:46.59]I don't think I can... Home appliances?
[236:55.66]Kitchen?
[236:56.48]Other?
[236:59.30]I don't think it exists.
[237:03.05]Fix it or... You guys gotta... I'm not gonna fix it.
[237:07.37]No.
[237:09.33]Don't do this to me.
[237:10.55]Oh my god.
[237:15.25]But what happened?
[237:15.79]Where?
[237:59.57]Why are you able to manipulate me so easily?
[238:03.75]You're playing to my vices.
[238:05.33]You're playing to my problems.
[238:12.59]Are those folders?
[238:16.37]Yeah.
[238:18.21]They're file folders.
[238:25.21]Thank God this can be done with note.
[238:26.97]And I don't have to look at it ever again.
[238:36.18]Perfect.
[238:38.66]Now we need black paint here.
[238:44.14]Or some kind of saved.
[238:50.85]Tables.
[238:52.77]I guess I could do this, right?
[238:55.65]Could I just put a table over it?
[239:05.05]The table needs to be black, though.
[239:08.79]It's fucking... I'm gonna fuck up my house.
[239:12.51]This is just... Hey, fuck up your house.
[239:14.43]Just destroy... Guys, you're a millionaire.
[239:18.21]How much money do you have?
[239:33.71]Black paint goes here.
[239:36.61]And then it's a bowling alley, so of course we have to absolutely decimate these walls.
[239:42.55]This place has to be the ugliest place you've ever been to.
[239:46.74]It has to be ugly, disgusting, a bunch of fucked up colors.
[240:04.27]Make a fireplace?
[240:05.25]I can't.
[240:05.63]I guess that you can't make a fireplace, apparently.
[240:10.99]Okay, what are we looking at here?
[240:14.51]We're going to do purple, orange, blue.
[240:16.97]This is going to be the ugliest thing ever, but it's a bowling alley, so it has to be like this.
[240:20.88]Orange, purple, bright green.
[240:33.26]Let's see.
[240:35.24]Yeah, it's gotta be all kinds of fucked up.
[240:43.24]Fireplace and survival?
[240:50.90]No, it's bunk bed.
[240:52.00]That's it.
[240:54.60]No fireplace, unfortunately.
[240:58.77]Yeah, orange, green shit all over the place.
[241:00.49]If I could draw, I would just scribble all over the walls.
[241:04.64]Okay, back to paint.
[241:12.30]Let's give it a go.
[241:12.98]This doesn't even matter, by the way.
[241:24.41]Like, you guys... Next time you go to a bowling alley, look at the walls.
[241:29.77]And you tell me this is incorrect.
[241:43.17]Oh, that's not paint, it's ice cream.
[241:44.69]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[241:53.54]Okay, whatever, that's fine.
[242:04.07]Stop wasting ice cream.
[242:20.38]Now the wall is going to be ugly and sticky.
[242:24.76]Explain to me a couple of things here.
[242:26.65]One, I need to know this.
[242:28.81]Did the guy that invented the bowling alley also invent the movie theater?
[242:33.21]Because they both made the same way.
[242:36.17]Some guy was just a genius back in like the 40s and decided, you know, this is how it's all going to look.
[242:42.26]Every movie theater looks like this too.
[242:44.69]The ground is just a ton of fucking ugly ass colors and the walls are like green, purple, yellow, orange.
[242:51.28]Why is it like this?
[242:52.38]Who did this?
[242:55.78]Why does this look like every movie theater you've ever been to?
[243:00.04]It just does.
[243:09.61]Movies didn't exist in the 40s.
[243:10.89]Yes, they did.
[243:11.44]What do you mean movies didn't exist in the 40s?
[243:14.56]Oh, this guy's fucked up.
[243:41.65]This is turning into anti-chamber.
[243:52.32]And then we're gonna go over all this.
[243:53.66]By the way, you're missing the biggest thing of all.
[243:57.32]When this is all done, we're going over this in black.
[244:01.23]And we're gonna darken the whole thing.
[244:19.66]Yeah, this is the bowling alley, birthday party, movie theater.
[244:23.04]They're all like this.
[244:46.49]The fruit loop house.
[244:50.43]It's not too much orange.
[244:51.45]I'm going to fix it.
[244:56.35]Fruit loop.
[244:57.23]I can't get over that.
[244:58.33]Fruit loop house.
[244:59.14]Are we just missing the green?
[245:00.94]That's it.
[245:06.72]Okay, honestly, how demented would you have to actually be to do this in your house?
[245:14.86]If you know somebody that has a room like this in their house, they are demented.
[245:23.17]I refuse to believe that they aren't.
[245:36.34]This is the type of person that, like, practices their evil laugh in the mirror for like four hours a day.
[245:47.83]And they still haven't gotten it right.
[245:50.27]Too much orange.
[245:50.91]It's okay.
[245:51.39]I'll fix it.
[245:58.34]Oh, I love this room.
[246:00.40]I'm just imagining a huge, heavy-ass bowling ball that you fucking gun down this arcway.
[246:06.35]And it just smashes into the wall every time.
[246:08.99]You don't fix it.
[246:10.53]You pay somebody else to come fix it, like, once a month.
[246:13.05]What the fuck do you care?
[246:14.76]You're a sicko.
[246:27.70]No, the green's too much.
[246:28.62]The green fucks the whole thing up.
[246:35.20]We gotta get some purple.
[246:36.78]Red?
[246:46.65]Isn't that the point?
[246:47.23]No, it has to be specific shades.
[246:53.71]Oh, now the whole thing is ruined.
[247:02.08]So this is what I was talking about doing.
[247:03.64]Ready?
[247:13.90]See?
[247:22.95]That wasn't the plan.
[247:23.73]It's like it's dirt.
[247:26.13]These places are not kept up that well.
[247:47.43]Let's get the whole thing here.
[247:48.35]Good.
[247:52.69]Looking good so far.
[247:53.44]I need a little more red and purple on the wall here.
[247:55.36]Less purple over here, please.
[247:56.58]A little more red.
[248:12.04]Yeah, nice and dingy.
[248:18.25]Let's get the purple over here too.
[248:19.49]Alright, looking pretty good.
[248:41.77]Look at that.
[248:42.71]Very close.
[248:43.61]Can I spill more stuff on the ground?
[248:45.91]Or can I not do that?
[248:51.31]Is there a way for me to spawn cockroaches?
[249:07.58]Dermot, you're a psychopath.
[249:10.40]I'm recreating a bowling alley.
[249:20.17]Get a mob spawner.
[249:24.81]No!
[249:25.03]What am I?
[249:25.41]Don't clean the window?
[249:26.91]Are you out of your mind?
[249:33.57]Will the guy that sprays the shoes for a living clean this window?
[249:38.53]No.
[249:39.57]The guy that owns the place?
[249:41.95]The guy that for some reason always looks like he's perspirating across his whole body?
[249:48.80]He's not gonna do that.
[249:54.57]A guy that you and your friends have told yourselves, had joked about, would you ever pay to smell him?
[249:59.28]No.
[249:59.78]It's going to be 50 bucks for me to smell that guy.
[250:10.26]That's going to be me.
[250:12.46]And I can choose how I want to live my life.
[250:17.45]That's rude.
[250:18.17]I know it's rude.
[250:23.78]I'm not condoning the behavior.
[250:25.30]I need... No, what do I need here?
[250:48.05]Down here.
[250:51.34]You got to put a shitty soda... No, no, yeah.
[250:57.64]Look, let me like retract a few statements here.
[250:59.58]Let me clarify a few things.
[251:01.37]Bowling alleys, every single one I've ever been to, have been disgusting places.
[251:08.17]I want to clarify this.
[251:10.07]For some reason, none of them have updated since 1981.
[251:12.53]All of them.
[251:13.17]All of them.
[251:17.96]They still have those machines that you go in and you put six quarters in.
[251:23.47]And it pisses out a hot chocolate or a coffee.
[251:27.05]You put the cup down and it... A coffee.
[251:32.73]They still have those.
[251:39.08]This is authentic.
[251:44.08]The stains on the ground, the dirt, the walls, it's authentic.
[252:02.26]That doesn't mean I don't love those places.
[252:04.58]You understand?
[252:06.18]Just because something is a little off the beaten path, a little grimy, a little under the weather, that's part of its charm.
[252:17.01]The guy that comes over, that I was talking about, that guy that sprays the shoes, that if the arcade machine is broken, he comes over and he walks over and he's like, yeah, what are you kids doing over here?
[252:27.02]Uh, sir, the arcade machine doesn't work anymore.
[252:29.36]Oh, yeah?
[252:33.88]Yeah, have fun, kids.
[252:36.52]And he goes back to what he was doing.
[252:37.73]It's like, oh, thanks, man.
[252:39.07]That was cool.
[252:44.19]And he walks away and...
[252:46.74]And you're happy.
[252:47.76]And it's a fun place.
[252:53.48]Let's finish painting it.
[252:59.65]I already deleted the paint.
[253:02.55]Just do the next room already.
[253:09.72]Just hold on a minute.
[253:17.68]I need to relive this.
[253:21.96]I need a table.
[253:32.47]That's fine.
[253:37.17]No, I don't have to leave it on the floor.
[253:40.70]There we go, except this is much nicer than the ones that I've seen.
[253:50.28]Somebody came in and said I'm doing everything the complete opposite of what I'm supposed to do Yeah, all right.
[253:56.10]Hold on a minute.
[253:58.87]I I have this is like our number 35 in this game We're just having some fun.
[254:05.03]That's all You need to put a pool I don't think there is a pool table
[254:20.86]No, that's fine.
[254:22.32]We got our bowling alley.
[254:23.32]Let's move in here.
[254:29.62]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[254:32.01]Okay, this is the electronics store, right?
[254:41.85]Yeah, you do need the thing here, don't you?
[254:45.18]This thing.
[254:46.38]Everyone wants me to skip this room, but look, you need the thing that is here with the TV on it.
[255:10.33]More.
[255:10.61]I need a little bit more.
[255:15.48]Make sure it doesn't encroach.
[255:21.44]So then you bowl and you look up.
[255:22.80]Oh, nice.
[255:24.16]What'd I get?
[255:24.62]Needs to be a little bit further back.
[255:36.85]Needs to be centered?
[255:39.61]Is it usually that kind of... I gotta delete the garage.
[255:42.52]I can't.
[255:44.41]So if you bowl from right here, that means it's got to be, like, right there.
[255:51.38]Should it be centered?
[255:53.42]Or should it be a little bit off to the side?
[255:55.86]I think it's off to the side a little bit here.
[256:04.21]One more here, and then one more to the left.
[256:12.51]Yeah, that's good.
[256:13.47]Will the TV fit on this?
[256:14.43]I'm thinking maybe one more.
[256:29.66]I need a counter right here.
[256:30.74]A little countertop thing.
[256:40.78]Oh, what can it be?
[256:41.58]It's got to be... Almost like a... It's like a counter thing to punch the numbers in.
[256:50.94]It's upside down.
[256:52.42]Shoe rental station.
[256:53.67]I can't spend that much more time in here.
[256:56.43]I'm going to give somebody an aneurysm.
[256:58.69]There's a cupboard.
[257:02.37]There we go.
[257:02.87]This is like punching the names in.
[257:16.84]No, that's not going to work.
[257:20.62]Shoe rental.
[257:22.54]I own this house.
[257:23.40]There's no shoe rental.
[257:24.40]No, I don't.
[257:26.20]Just hold on.
[257:29.58]I need a little device.
[257:30.42]I just need a little table.
[257:40.21]Like a desk.
[257:40.83]Here we go.
[257:43.91]There.
[257:44.37]This will be fine.
[257:46.23]That's actually perfect.
[257:47.63]This is identical to what they look like.
[257:51.97]I mean actually identical.
[257:53.27]That's what it looks like.
[257:53.87]Alright.
[258:01.80]Need a little chair.
[258:06.00]They're always like a dumpy little chair.
[258:08.26]This one, just make it
[258:12.88]They are usually silver for some reason, aren't they?
[258:15.12]Or black.
[258:16.50]We'll go with... Let's go with black.
[258:18.49]It's easier.
[258:18.87]Alright, that's good.
[258:27.49]This is upside down.
[258:28.27]Yeah, it is.
[258:29.15]Good.
[258:37.72]What is back here?
[258:38.56]This is the backyard?
[258:41.30]Fuck the backyard.
[258:46.00]So now, oh my boy, oh boy.
[258:47.95]I gotta use the bathroom.
[258:55.28]I'll be back.
[258:55.70]I gotta pee.
[258:58.71]I'll be right back.
[259:00.29]Hang tight.
[260:01.55]Ehhhhh?
[262:19.33]Sorry, I just had to have some bologna.
[262:25.80]It was important.
[262:32.48]All right, here we go.
[262:39.51]Loud bologna.
[262:45.05]Continue.
[262:48.92]Bowling alley looks pretty much done to me.
[262:53.37]Didn't paint this.
[262:55.53]We can do cleanup later.
[262:56.67]We can touch up later.
[262:57.77]I'm not concerned about that.
[262:58.93]What I am concerned about is the goddamn door not being on here.
[263:01.67]You know what I'm saying?
[263:10.32]If this isn't going to be a mall, then wouldn't it just be open?
[263:16.00]No, it wouldn't, right?
[263:16.80]No, it wouldn't.
[263:17.28]It would be open.
[263:20.18]They might be like a little... Bowling only has doors.
[263:26.71]Yeah, that would be weird.
[263:29.27]Oh, fuck.
[263:29.95]I need to make two more of these.
[263:32.51]No, I do not, actually.
[263:34.65]I don't have to do that.
[263:35.93]I don't have to make two more lanes.
[263:39.26]I'd make a lane here and have it be out the door.
[263:42.10]Have it be just bowl out the door.
[263:43.98]And the bowling ball goes back here.
[263:50.57]just in case I think that that's a funny idea because I do I need to do this just to see if this is worth doing it's very important now I can't put them outside I was going to say just put like a hundred out here so they've all you know I didn't even care to come ever clean them up
[264:17.86]Alright, let's do this.
[264:18.86]This is an electronic store.
[264:21.28]What does an electronic store look like?
[264:24.10]First, let's get some... Let me think here.
[264:28.12]The walls in an electronic store are usually blue.
[264:31.59]Bright blue.
[264:32.33]And yellow.
[264:36.11]Guns.
[264:36.75]Gun store.
[264:40.93]Guys, my house mall makes no sense.
[264:45.54]you you think that this should be an ice cream store a gun store a bowling alley and a furniture store guns ice cream and bowling I don't know what it has to be I have to be like a picture like a painting store
[265:14.35]Gun store, gun store.
[265:22.04]A gun store would be too easy.
[265:23.36]Right, we need to make a computer store.
[265:26.58]I'm making a computer store.
[265:29.70]I'm not doing a gun store.
[265:31.62]That's too easy.
[265:32.48]Let's just make a desk and then make guns and put guns all over desks.
[265:42.75]I'm making a computer electronics store.
[265:45.77]And that's final.
[265:50.47]I can't, this has to be closed.
[265:54.39]I've never been in a gun store?
[265:58.69]Yes, I have.
[266:05.90]Assuming I've never been into a place where weapons are sold.
[266:13.60]What are you talking about?
[266:16.26]I don't own any firearms.
[266:18.64]Doesn't mean I haven't ever seen a weapon being in a place of business before.
[266:24.15]Guys, Walmart used to sell shotguns.
[266:26.23]I'm not even sure if they still do.
[266:27.83]Are those real?
[266:28.85]Are those real guns at Walmart?
[266:31.25]Everybody has.
[266:31.75]Yeah, so...
[266:39.01]Hold on, wait a minute.
[266:39.53]You've been inside of a store that sells weapons?
[266:41.29]Yeah, you did too when you bought your shampoo last week at Walmart.
[266:50.98]Why are you getting so defensive about this?
[266:52.44]How dare you?
[266:53.10]How dare you accuse me?
[266:56.87]He's defenseless.
[266:58.41]Get him.
[267:03.23]Is it BB guns?
[267:05.17]You can still put somebody's eye out.
[267:07.71]Didn't you guys see the Christmas story?
[267:09.95]Those things are dangerous.
[267:10.79]Don't fuck around with those.
[267:12.93]Only use Call of Duty.
[267:15.89]Play Call of Duty.
[267:25.61]Alright, this is done.
[267:28.63]Nerf guns only.
[267:44.28]This is fine.
[267:45.82]Open floor plan.
[267:46.84]Remember, this has to be a different store.
[267:52.56]But, yeah, no, yes.
[267:53.58]I have fired a gun before.
[267:55.30]Yes.
[267:55.96]At a range.
[267:57.30]I have.
[268:00.26]I have used a firearm at a range before.
[268:03.66]It was very interesting.
[268:19.21]Out of range!
[268:20.09]With safety precautions, it was a pla- it was a business, it was- it was very safe.
[268:36.30]Oh my fucking god.
[268:40.42]I can't even look over at- I can't even look over.
[268:43.16]Out of range!
[268:52.01]all right all right all right all right all right all right all right okay simba down that looks fine uh all right we need yellow this is gonna be a
[269:18.95]It's going to look like a Best Buy, but it's not going to be a Best Buy.
[269:22.23]Because I don't want them to think that I'm putting their trademark on my stream.
[269:27.32]But it's absolutely going to be a Best Buy.
[269:32.74]Just not going to say it.
[269:34.32]And you're not going to think that either, so don't think that.
[269:37.66]Let's go paint.
[269:46.51]There it is.
[269:48.57]There's the absolutely, definitely Best Buy paint.
[270:13.04]Call of Duty.
[270:13.74]I don't know, when was the last time I even played Call of Duty?
[270:20.49]Are they still making them?
[270:21.37]I know they made Black Ops 4 or something, right?
[270:31.76]Hey, remember that game you played last year?
[270:35.78]Yeah.
[270:37.06]Good.
[270:40.60]Is that it?
[270:43.02]Uh, yep.
[270:47.04]Okay.
[270:50.99]Low-hanging fruit.
[270:52.71]Is it really, though?
[271:00.05]That's low-hanging fruit.
[271:07.46]I'm not trying to make a joke.
[271:08.36]I'm trying to make a reference to the fact that... What the heck?
[271:11.22]That's all I'm trying to say is, what the heck, man?
[271:14.48]Wait, this needs to be yellow.
[271:15.30]Okay, that's how we're going to do it.
[271:26.25]Why does the roller get bigger?
[271:27.37]Because it's essentially a giant sponge.
[271:39.94]When did I make fun of Call of Duty?
[271:43.04]I didn't make fun of Call of Duty.
[271:47.07]I can if you want me to.
[271:47.91]And I will.
[271:50.29]Would you like to hear that?
[271:51.95]I could.
[271:52.17]I could.
[272:13.98]Where's the actual lightning yellow?
[272:16.66]Do they even have one?
[272:17.82]Sunny yellow?
[272:18.56]I swear to God, where is it?
[272:24.30]That's not the yellow I'm talking about.
[272:25.58]I'm talking about the electric yellow.
[272:30.95]Maybe I should try more.
[272:31.79]Yeah, there it is.
[272:32.31]That's fine.
[272:46.53]Just make it a blockbuster video instead.
[272:49.65]I could put the books up and it would look like videotapes.
[272:53.84]And then this would really be a 90s strip mall.
[272:56.38]It really actually would.
[272:57.28]I need mustard.
[273:14.45]Yeah, that actually is true.
[273:17.45]This is not even the Best Buy colors.
[273:19.05]This is just lazy business color.
[273:22.71]There's so many businesses that have bright blue and bright yellow as their colors.
[273:28.43]Major, major businesses.
[273:40.18]Okay, that's... I think I want a strip here.
[273:44.42]In fact, I do.
[273:46.84]And I'm gonna do it.
[273:59.63]I hate it.
[273:59.97]I don't like it.
[274:07.02]God, I want some more bologna.
[274:16.83]Anybody in the chat ever get a pure bologna craving that you can only solve with eating bologna?
[274:24.83]Nothing else will do it for you.
[274:34.67]Doesn't matter.
[274:35.92]It's not that I'm hungry.
[274:37.54]I'm kind of hungry.
[274:38.08]I could use some food.
[274:38.80]No, no, no.
[274:39.64]I need to have bologna put in my mouth.
[274:41.78]That's it.
[274:43.80]And it doesn't matter what it is.
[274:45.22]I can't solve it any other way.
[274:48.52]Let's get lighter floors, too.
[274:52.64]What's a Best Buy floor look like?
[274:55.24]Dark carpet?
[274:59.74]Is it carpet in a Best Buy?
[275:02.38]It is, isn't it?
[275:02.94]There we go.
[275:13.49]Oh, well, shit.
[275:14.35]Um.
[275:23.03]That's not going to work.
[275:24.01]I thought I could... I gave it an attempt.
[275:30.87]It has to be floor panels and floor coverings.
[275:35.95]Man, they really are skimping on the floors, huh?
[275:48.58]Oh, well.
[275:51.50]Gonna have to go with the blue.
[276:00.82]Yeah, close enough.
[276:04.29]This is the same thing that's inside of the bowling alley, though.
[276:10.77]It's so dark in this room.
[276:12.43]We need to brighten this place up a little.
[276:14.53]I might need more yellow on the walls.
[276:32.36]Okay.
[276:34.20]Nah, I got you.
[276:35.04]I got you.
[276:35.48]You thought I was fucking being dumb.
[276:37.97]Alright, so now... I need to connect these.
[276:46.97]Better lights.
[276:47.80]Just get recessed lights in the whole damn place.
[276:49.50]There's no reason for anything else.
[276:55.34]These halogens are just so much better for every single reason.
[277:14.19]That sucks, actually.
[277:17.73]The other thing was better.
[277:19.99]He's lagging the computer.
[277:24.07]What kind of person owns this house?
[277:25.74]Well, there's my theory, right?
[277:29.48]So you've got a neighborhood, a bunch of people around, and nobody decides to do this, what I'm doing.
[277:35.14]Oh, I want to buy a house and go move into it.
[277:37.44]No, no, no, no, no.
[277:37.98]Just buy a house.
[277:39.64]Why not try to turn it into a place of business?
[277:41.44]Make it a mall.
[277:44.50]there are people this is a whole neighborhood people walk their dogs people walk around they have barbecues they have block parties this is a this is a mall just buy a house and turn it into a fucking mall and sleep in the attic or something because it's illegal not if you get a license zoning violation not if you know the not if you know the mayor
[278:16.29]Is it illegal?
[278:18.56]Zoning violation.
[278:19.92]Land of the free, huh?
[278:22.92]Zoning violation.
[278:24.02]Let's see what it means.
[278:28.22]So you got a zoning violation notice.
[278:30.16]Now what?
[278:31.52]Let's see.
[278:31.82]I'm going to read this.
[278:40.85]You arrive home that evening from work and sort through the mail, like you normally do, bills, ads, and even a birthday card from your great-aunt Doris.
[278:50.07]The usual.
[278:51.17]At the bottom of the pile, though, is a letter from your local zoning office that seems odd.
[278:54.63]You open it to find the words, Notice of Zoning Violation, scrolled across the top of the letter.
[278:59.82]You read on to find that the zoning administrator has determined your property is in violation of the local zoning ordinance and that you have ten days to correct the problem or you will start to incur fines until you do.
[279:17.33]let's see here hold on so you just get you what if you just what if you did okay what if you hold on though so you just get fined after 10 days if you don't get if you don't comply you just get fined what if your business is booming just pay the fucking fine every week that doesn't matter
[279:39.30]Yeah, you got 10 days to be profitable.
[279:41.52]You just have to make like $15,000 a week.
[279:45.04]Pay the $500 a week fine.
[279:47.60]And who cares?
[279:51.03]They continue to find you more each time.
[279:52.97]Well, keep... That should be a... That should be very, very, very, very good for you.
[280:00.27]Because that lights the fire under your ass.
[280:03.47]You need to have more money.
[280:04.39]Make more profit.
[280:05.53]You know what?
[280:05.87]Build an extension to your house.
[280:07.60]Add another store.
[280:08.20]Mmm.
[280:10.75]At some point, you'll have a gigantic fucking mall in your neighborhood and you're gonna just pay more fines?
[280:15.60]Who cares?
[280:17.32]Just make 10% more than what you're being fined for and you're fine.
[280:29.87]Do not listen to this man.
[280:35.27]Yeah, buy your neighbor's house.
[280:37.29]Eventually just buy the whole neighborhood and you make yourself a goddamn Walt Disney World.
[280:42.45]People will be coming all over the world to come see your house-connected giant Mall of America.
[280:50.38]Oh, that's terrible.
[280:51.56]You owe $485,000 a week in fines.
[280:55.12]Who cares?
[280:56.64]People are taking pictures in front of your house for $40 a pop because it's interesting.
[281:12.10]Just buy the zoning office too.
[281:14.36]Eventually you'll connect to the point where you're in midtown and you can buy the office.
[281:19.20]Alright, what was I doing?
[281:27.88]I need to make some flights.
[281:33.79]These big ones are fine.
[281:36.89]Two of them.
[281:40.99]That's good.
[281:46.72]Own the office, pay the fines, and get your own fines back.
[282:04.32]I wonder how long you could keep that going before they came after you and bulldozed your house.
[282:16.09]But then that's just another movie, right?
[282:19.93]There's a guy who has to ra- They did make a movie of this!
[282:22.97]I'm describing that Will Ferrell movie.
[282:26.56]Didn't they already do this?
[282:29.40]They made a casino in their house.
[282:31.60]It's called The House.
[282:32.76]They already did this.
[282:38.08]And they were fine.
[282:46.05]Yeah, take that whole thing off the table.
[282:47.69]That was a Will Ferrell movie.
[282:48.83]Never mind.
[282:50.79]Old material, apparently.
[282:51.99]Okay.
[282:55.82]I need tables.
[282:57.88]Tables.
[283:00.36]Here we go.
[283:02.24]These ones can be fine.
[283:03.24]Let's get a few of these.
[283:06.68]Different electronics.
[283:08.86]Computers, monitors.
[283:11.65]Anything that you need.
[283:12.51]Come on in, right?
[283:13.23]Okay.
[283:17.78]One more in the corner here.
[283:22.46]Right here.
[283:24.54]That's alright.
[283:26.16]Now we need computers.
[283:32.14]Computer, let's do Phoenix.
[283:44.37]The other one too.
[283:55.12]Okay.
[283:56.58]Intel Pentium inside.
[283:59.68]Let's do another set of these.
[284:04.24]We need monitors, too.
[284:05.64]I'll do another desk for monitors.
[284:12.49]Ooh, wait.
[284:13.05]Whoa, hold on.
[284:13.53]These are a lot of money.
[284:15.51]Oh, fuck.
[284:20.23]What did I drop?
[284:20.75]Like $15,000? $15,000?
[284:24.26]That's alright, I don't have to do anymore.
[284:34.67]The gaming mice.
[284:40.40]These aren't expensive, right?
[284:44.22]It's only $16, this is fine.
[284:50.17]Watch out for the zoning person.
[284:52.93]They're gonna come get you.
[284:57.18]Actually, I want these up here.
[285:00.08]Uneven.
[285:01.46]That don't matter.
[285:04.19]I'm gonna put, like, a bunch of monitors over here, too.
[285:11.39]Let me just get these out of the way.
[285:12.19]Hold on.
[285:12.57]Okay, monitor.
[285:18.73]We're not gonna spend any money.
[285:19.77]I'm just gonna put, like, a bunch on the table.
[285:42.77]Okay.
[285:44.53]Alright, that's cool.
[285:47.87]Move the mice.
[285:52.78]I'm fixing it right now.
[286:09.08]And speakers too, right?
[286:11.33]They sell speakers at Best Buy... Where is it?
[286:18.07]Home Electronics.
[286:19.91]They sell microwaves at Best Buy?
[286:21.31]No.
[286:28.88]There's no rhyme or reason to this shit.
[286:30.12]Who cares?
[286:42.39]Alright, you get the idea, right?
[286:43.67]Imagine if you could use a computer like this.
[286:59.98]People have two monitors.
[287:01.02]Imagine having two monitors and six mice on both sides.
[287:06.81]What would you use those for?
[287:08.27]Imagine, what would they be connected with?
[287:13.05]Somebody could probably make this work in EVE Online.
[287:17.59]I'm sure of it.
[287:25.84]The mice are backwards?
[287:27.38]No, they're displaying this way.
[287:32.02]You need to have eight arms.
[287:34.28]Octopus.
[287:34.78]Alright, there's Best Buy.
[287:36.66]Pretty check.
[287:39.12]Although I want to put at least a little bit of a
[287:42.95]I don't know.
[287:44.03]There's honestly no reason to care about any of this.
[287:47.03]But with this deep, we've drank the Kool-Aid.
[287:51.17]We have to finish it.
[287:58.80]I wish I could have a sign.
[287:59.72]Wait.
[288:01.30]Hold on just a minute here.
[288:04.42]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[288:06.04]My brain is moving around here.
[288:13.44]Hold on a minute.
[288:18.63]If I can take a picture of letters.
[288:21.85]Close up.
[288:24.85]Take a picture of B. Take a picture of an E. Just do like a ransom note sign.
[288:38.47]Oh, hold on.
[288:40.65]Where's the gallery folder?
[288:42.19]I'm just gonna put the logo in there.
[288:54.61]Hold on.
[289:07.03]Save that to the desktop.
[289:10.44]This should work, right?
[289:16.20]My computer's freaking out because I downloaded this.
[289:17.90]No, that's not going to work.
[289:23.40]Oh, fuck you.
[289:23.94]What the hell?
[289:26.60]There we go.
[289:28.18]Okay, so now if I save this to the folder, I should be able to put this in here, right?
[289:37.40]So what folder...
[289:39.38]I'm going to have to restart the game, though.
[289:40.52]That's okay.
[289:40.80]This is important.
[289:46.47]Alright.
[289:49.33]What do you mean?
[289:49.69]It's just the Steam folder?
[289:51.25]For this folder to be there?
[289:53.13]Probably, right?
[290:00.62]Let's see.
[290:05.38]Hmm.
[290:05.78]I don't know where the folder is.
[290:10.10]Data, resources.
[290:15.93]Save it?
[290:16.25]No, don't worry.
[290:16.83]I'll save it.
[290:17.27]I don't know where the folder is, though.
[290:21.59]Asset bundles?
[290:22.41]It's not in the Steam folder.
[290:29.62]Open gallery folder.
[290:30.84]Well, there it is.
[290:31.50]Okay.
[290:32.78]Where the hell is this?
[290:34.60]Oh, this is in my roaming app data.
[290:37.12]Okay.
[290:37.48]Well, that's fine.
[290:40.70]I never would have found this.
[290:45.84]Alright, I'm going to put it in there.
[290:55.67]Hopefully I don't have to turn the game off.
[290:59.43]You know, just in case something crazy happens here, I'm going to save.
[291:02.11]Uh...
[291:06.24]How do I get it to save?
[291:07.02]I need to, like... I'm gonna, like, build, like, a stupid wall.
[291:09.84]Alright, save the game.
[291:19.81]That should be fine, right?
[291:21.59]Your progress will be automatically saved.
[291:23.13]Yes.
[291:26.01]Turn your camera off.
[291:26.73]You're naked.
[291:27.21]Well, that's impossible.
[291:29.80]Alright, let's turn this off.
[291:34.46]Exit game.
[291:37.63]Put in the logo.
[291:38.57]Why don't we just do this too for fun?
[291:44.11]What of the fucking dumb pictures do I have on my computer?
[291:51.81]Do I have a picture just of my face like stretched out or something I can put on the front door?
[292:00.58]I spelled that wrong.
[292:08.47]Yeah, everybody loves this picture.
[292:13.49]Let's go ahead and put that in there.
[292:19.65]Why not this one too?
[292:20.64]Okay, that sounds good.
[292:27.48]This one's also scary.
[292:28.88]Again, this is going to turn very, very ugly here in a minute.
[292:33.04]That's good.
[292:33.76]Don't need any more.
[292:40.27]Where the fuck did that go?
[292:43.69]I swear to God, I save things to my desktop and then they just hide.
[292:46.49]They're actually not on the desktop.
[292:49.61]Where are you hiding?
[292:50.97]Why are you not here?
[292:51.69]What the fuck are you doing?
[292:59.42]Where is it?
[293:01.38]Finally.
[293:01.86]Jesus Christ.
[293:02.92]Okay.
[293:04.92]Alright, let's go.
[293:06.10]Coming back.
[293:11.86]Computer so complicated I Should be able to think and it just goes in I Should really look at the screen.
[293:19.45]It is move my eyes in place in folder Come back See if that worked
[293:41.47]Chad is in focus only mode or is allowed to let me focus.
[293:46.23]What?
[293:47.11]What are you talking about?
[293:55.02]What is this?
[293:55.68]All right.
[293:58.02]Back to the house.
[294:00.40]Oh, where are we?
[294:01.74]This one, right?
[294:03.80]Unwaste house.
[294:05.52]That's the one.
[294:06.20]Go to the house.
[294:16.05]Come on in.
[294:16.49]Let's go ahead and get the logo here.
[294:19.09]I'm going to paint this blue.
[294:20.55]Don't worry.
[294:20.93]Oh, come on.
[294:35.90]It's too wide.
[294:42.24]Really?
[295:04.54]Where am I gonna sleep?
[295:08.34]Should I just turn this into a copyright dog shit stream?
[295:11.72]Should I get like an ice cream store name and put it right there?
[295:13.88]I'm gonna paint this blue.
[295:19.40]This place is gonna be called... I gotta do this in paint then.
[295:22.51]No, that...
[295:35.40]Please have this be the whole house.
[295:40.30]Come on.
[295:44.46]No.
[295:45.00]God damn it.
[295:51.29]Can't do it anyways.
[295:57.09]How is this not allowed here?
[296:01.05]Put it in the garage?
[296:06.21]You're turning this into a shitty second life server.
[296:10.63]Well, not yet, because I didn't put it there yet.
[296:13.50]Can I go right here?
[296:23.31]What?
[296:25.53]What?
[296:42.09]No, it can't.
[296:44.01]I can't just put this all over the... Oh, that was so much money.
[297:10.32]That's not worth it.
[297:26.33]That was $10,000 for this.
[297:27.88]No, it's gotta be here.
[297:47.60]Whatever.
[297:47.92]Into the Best Buy.
[297:49.96]Let's paint this wall.
[298:17.25]Only artwork they have.
[298:19.79]Alright, I have to stop.
[298:21.16]No, this is dumb.
[298:22.20]I'm done with this.
[298:33.52]I wish there could be the entire wallpaper.
[298:38.78]No, I'm ruining this.
[298:40.00]Stop ruining this.
[298:40.98]That's fine.
[298:41.78]Because this is my mall.
[298:44.32]This one's allowed to be here.
[298:45.60]The other ones don't have any reason to be there.
[298:48.12]It has to be.
[299:29.14]Now we're getting into some weird performance artist bullshit.
[299:38.96]Welcome to the ice cream store.
[299:43.39]Hey, do you like to waste $30,000?
[299:44.41]Because that's what I just did.
[299:52.51]Okay, stop it.
[299:54.29]Stop it.
[299:55.77]Paint.
[299:56.37]Bye.
[300:10.05]No, no more!
[300:10.99]I got- No, I was gonna get more pic- No, we're done.
[300:13.45]Paint.
[300:19.21]Scroll up.
[300:20.05]What are you doing?
[300:23.52]I need the blue.
[300:24.18]Blue, blue, blue.
[300:26.14]There it is.
[300:31.02]More pictures.
[300:32.84]You're ruining my vision.
[300:35.38]My vision is a mall, not- Look at how stupid I look on every wall.
[300:41.89]You're impeding all my vision.
[300:53.78]There we go.
[300:54.18]That's fine.
[300:55.16]That looks good.
[300:55.82]Everything in here to get this one too.
[301:17.66]No cash registers.
[301:19.28]It's because it's all free.
[301:20.24]All right.
[301:37.46]There's the Best Buy.
[301:40.68]And here is... What is this going to be?
[301:45.34]No, not a furniture store.
[301:46.28]Electronics.
[301:47.84]Bowling alley.
[301:51.05]Ice cream.
[301:55.55]I don't want to see that anymore up here.
[301:56.77]This is too... I like this too much.
[302:03.03]Make a hot topic.
[302:03.87]Do you have like an information center?
[302:15.55]Make a hot topic?
[302:17.72]Okay, fine.
[302:18.62]We'll make a hot topic.
[302:29.55]Easy enough.
[302:29.95]I need to make a Burger King.
[302:37.37]There is no food, you're right.
[302:40.76]I'm gonna have to section off a wall and make Burger King.
[302:47.89]Well, there are no windows in a Hot Topic.
[302:49.47]Okay.
[303:03.84]Just wall over the windows.
[303:06.03]You know, I could do that.
[303:06.85]You're right.
[303:13.19]Does it turn it into a target?
[303:17.23]I need this to be red to be a target.
[303:20.36]We already have a target next to a Best Buy.
[303:23.90]Why would that happen?
[303:26.72]No, this is going to be the goddamn hot topic.
[303:29.05]Here's the Best Buy.
[303:32.43]We're going to wall off.
[303:35.61]A portion of this has to be walled off because this can't just be a bowling alley.
[303:38.48]This is just too much.
[303:41.60]So I'm going to cave this in out here, line to here, and there's going to be another store here.
[303:53.27]You know what else we're doing?
[303:56.57]Yeah, zoning office.
[303:58.93]To the left here is going to be a store, and to the right, this is going to be your ice cream station.
[304:04.21]So I'm going to wall this off, get this out of here.
[304:12.09]This is a new store here.
[304:21.12]It's going to be just a little store right here, so let's go like this.
[304:31.22]I can't make a PetSmart.
[304:32.60]There's no animals.
[304:33.92]Actually, I could put bunnies in here.
[304:35.48]Yeah, we can do a PetSmart.
[304:38.42]PetSmart can't fit here, though.
[304:39.97]Can it?
[304:40.25]No.
[304:45.64]A pet store.
[304:46.46]Okay, this is going to be a little pet store.
[304:48.26]Do they have goldfish in this game?
[304:54.10]Okay, there's your red and white, by the way.
[305:00.77]That's PetSmart.
[305:03.79]PetSmart.
[305:06.67]By the way, fuck the bathroom.
[305:09.77]It's now a PetSmart.
[305:22.01]That would make sense too, because they have to wash the dogs, okay?
[305:24.57]Do you guys see what I'm doing here?
[305:30.09]They have to clean the dogs.
[305:31.17]This is like the grooming section of PetSmart.
[305:39.38]This needs to be sold and closed off.
[305:45.82]So this is all fine.
[305:49.22]This can stay, but there might be a couple of shelves in here where goldfish are sold.
[305:52.78]I'm okay with that.
[305:55.94]Alright, can we build this?
[305:56.86]No, I have to knock this whole thing down.
[306:05.42]Public toilet.
[306:07.92]No, that's where the cat goes to the bathroom.
[306:09.49]All the cats have been trained.
[306:11.21]They use the toilet paper, too.
[306:23.63]Okay, that's that.
[306:25.77]Forget about the sink.
[306:26.51]It's not necessary.
[306:33.58]I can't remove it.
[306:34.32]It doesn't matter.
[306:35.60]I don't need a radiator in here.
[306:36.58]Do I need a toilet in here?
[306:43.33]I can take this wall down.
[306:47.61]Okay, that's better.
[306:51.50]So here is your other entrance to this store.
[306:54.84]This has to be painted red.
[307:02.33]Ice cream store might be a little too big, but it's alright.
[307:06.33]That's the dog drinking fountain.
[307:09.53]PetSmart.
[307:10.43]Is red and blue?
[307:11.73]If I'm to be not mistaken here.
[307:30.60]No, I didn't abandon anything.
[307:32.92]We're expanding.
[307:33.66]Alright, there's a PetSmart.
[307:42.46]Let's go... I need to take a look at this.
[307:48.14]Best Buy.
[307:50.02]Hot Topic.
[307:51.98]PetSmart.
[307:54.00]Cold Stone.
[307:55.58]I'm gonna get fucking sued.
[308:09.17]Alright, now I need white.
[308:14.50]Right in here.
[308:22.87]Just bring the goddamn paint canister over here, please.
[308:42.74]Okay.
[308:43.92]White can stay there.
[308:44.84]Actually, the white can be on that side.
[308:49.62]This has to be red all the way down.
[308:55.60]It's going to be too much dog hair in the ice cream.
[309:00.35]Well, no.
[309:00.71]You can get your ice cream and you can come sit over here and you can go look at the dogs.
[309:05.99]And all the other animals.
[309:08.27]Ferrets and chinchillas.
[309:17.64]I'm going to get a cease and desist for making a fictional mall.
[309:29.16]All right, I need white.
[309:38.17]Is this PetSmart?
[309:38.73]This is Petco though, isn't it?
[309:41.41]Isn't Petco white and red?
[309:57.65]Alright, looking good.
[310:00.35]I gotta have a bunch of pictures.
[310:01.27]I gotta get dog and cat pictures.
[310:02.79]I gotta... This is gonna take a minute.
[310:06.22]I'm gonna get a bunch of dog photos.
[310:07.60]A bunch of cat photos.
[310:17.16]I have to get one of those flea and tick prevention pointers that you put all over the walls.
[310:25.89]Yeah, this is gonna take a minute.
[310:32.87]I need the visions to play out, so hold on.
[310:34.85]Let me get these.
[310:45.54]Flea and tick prevention poster.
[310:49.78]There it is.
[310:50.70]This is the thing that is in every single... There it is.
[310:54.03]I knew I was going to find it.
[310:56.07]Perfect.
[311:06.02]Okay, let's get that on the desktop.
[311:16.40]Yeah, PetSmart's blue.
[311:19.12]What about Petco?
[311:23.38]Yeah, Petco is the one that's, we can add some blue, it don't matter.
[311:34.05]Let's make sure we get the correct one.
[311:35.81]And now we need like this dog photo.
[311:43.13]Dog, like cute dog and cute cat.
[311:49.56]This one's fine.
[311:58.20]And then cute cat.
[312:04.81]First one, there it is, perfect.
[312:11.86]All right, let's upload these.
[312:12.80]I also need the Hot Topic logo, right?
[312:21.17]Did they change it?
[312:23.13]That's so stupid looking.
[312:24.95]That's just Times New Roman.
[312:26.97]No, where's the old one that was red?
[312:28.47]That's the one I wanna use.
[312:29.75]That's what I'm gonna use.
[312:40.74]OK.
[312:42.22]And then we need like a Fight Club poster, right?
[312:45.69]Because that's all they sell there.
[312:55.82]There it is.
[313:09.22]Yeah, that's a good one.
[313:10.42]Good, good, good.
[313:10.96]Kingdom Hearts.
[313:13.48]A good Kingdom Hearts poster.
[313:16.12]We're talking original Kingdom Hearts, not like any of the new ones.
[313:27.39]That's alright for now.
[313:29.27]Let's get these all in here.
[313:33.82]So let me just save it.
[313:38.36]Back to the office, save the game.
[313:49.75]Just in case we decide to do it.
[313:52.33]I might need it.
[313:56.67]I just got the Japanese Burger King logo.
[314:00.99]Oh yeah, the Burger King logo, the Japanese one.
[314:08.53]Alright.
[314:10.03]Let's get these all in here.
[314:11.12]Thank you for your patience.
[314:16.40]Alright, there it is.
[314:30.35]Oh, fuck me.
[314:32.29]Big money.
[314:32.79]Oh, shit.
[314:33.23]Really?
[314:35.93]Hold on.
[314:36.69]Let me just load this back up.

[314:41.20]Let me see who it is Thank you wherever you are, but give me one sec Don't open the windows store, but don't open the windows store don't open the windows store, please.
[314:53.65]Oh it opened the windows store Thank you so much to kill code Kill code.

[315:23.67]Really appreciate the 50 fucking dollars.
[315:25.19]Thank you, man.
[315:29.64]Okay, so let's open this up.
[315:33.96]Ah, fuck.
[315:34.62]I'm an idiot.
[315:40.60]Gallery, because I have to open it from here.
[315:45.86]All right, let's dump this all in here.
[315:47.70]We got the flea and tick, PetSmart.
[315:49.84]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[315:51.62]All right, put them all in here.
[315:54.22]Very good.
[315:55.97]Are they actually there?
[315:59.57]There they are, good.
[316:03.35]Although, where's PetSmart?
[316:07.81]I need another PetSmart logo, apparently.
[316:16.72]I'm not gonna get sued.
[316:17.64]This is all, this is for comedic purposes.
[316:21.84]The purpose is for comedic purposes.
[316:23.46]All right.
[316:32.48]Did that work?
[316:39.11]I need another one.
[316:47.63]Come on, give it to me.
[316:55.09]Why does it not want PetSmart?
[317:01.10]It apparently hates the fact that I want a PetSmart logo here.
[317:03.54]Maybe it's blocking it.
[317:06.60]No, it's not that smart, is it?
[317:13.66]Let's see.

[322:18.87]These are whatever you want.
[322:20.21]Whatever you want to say.
[322:24.05]These could be a litter of puppies.

[328:28.91]Wish I could paint the ceiling black.
[328:32.35]I can't though.
[328:38.76]I can do black on the floor, though, I think.
[328:40.44]Okay, that's fine.
[328:42.75]A little bit more.
[328:55.98]No, I don't want to buy another thing of black paint.
[329:00.16]Bullshit.
[329:03.94]Black paint.
[329:05.72]You gotta do what you gotta do.
[329:09.61]Take the light out?
[329:10.27]No, we'll get a better light here.
[329:12.87]We'll get a more appropriate light in a few minutes.
[329:23.84]Okay.
[329:25.86]Good.
[329:28.22]Take it to the wall here, right?
[329:29.72]Yep, right here.
[329:34.01]This is the entrance.
[329:36.39]This whole thing has to be black.
[329:45.63]Yep.
[329:47.43]Build it out.
[329:53.44]Actually scroll down to the bottom of the picture folder.
[329:58.66]Oh.
[330:00.50]What?
[330:02.19]Okay.
[330:14.65]I want Fight Club to be a little bit bigger.
[330:16.57]And shorter.
[330:16.99]So it looks more like a poster.
[330:44.18]I need the Nightmare Before Christmas.
[330:45.65]No, too many posters.
[330:47.85]I gotta end this mall.
[330:53.13]Still waiting for Burger King.
[330:55.85]There might be a place for it under the stairs.
[331:02.78]Shit!
[331:03.12]Damn it!
[331:14.11]Fuck me.
[331:28.02]What is causing all this?
[331:29.28]Stop!
[331:36.14]Alright, so it needs to come out one more.
[331:40.65]So from here, out.
[331:46.37]That's better.
[331:51.64]Okay, good.
[331:53.68]Paint it black.
[331:59.88]Now you can paint a wall.
[332:01.28]Oh, I thought I said I can't.
[332:02.38]What are you talking about?
[332:12.27]Okay, underneath.
[332:25.01]There's that.
[332:28.65]Oh God, now I gotta do the back here too.
[332:30.53]Why don't they just make them like this?
[332:34.79]Why do they have to make... Just give me like black paneling.
[332:39.09]Why can't drywall be black?
[332:41.63]Can I buy black drywall?
[332:45.88]Alright.
[332:46.36]Let's get that logo up there.
[332:48.60]Ooh.
[332:51.84]Okay.
[333:03.63]Where was I just able to put that?
[333:04.75]No.
[333:04.81]There we go.
[333:13.53]Almost.
[333:24.34]Let's go.
[333:31.80]Alright, this is what we're doing.
[333:34.56]Bowling alley is pretty cool, but... We need black floors here.
[333:44.02]This is where the Burger King is going.
[333:46.34]Sorry, this has got to go.
[333:47.06]It's alright, guys.
[333:52.89]It's just the way it is.
[334:05.96]I know.
[334:06.46]It's sad, I know.
[334:07.60]But, trust me.
[334:10.54]If we get to have another store, isn't that better?
[334:14.92]Okay, so then here is this wall here.
[334:22.58]Alright, so then the wall can come out from here to here to here.
[334:38.69]Fuck.
[334:39.03]Okay, yeah, right?
[334:39.99]So then right here
[334:45.02]And plus, this will make sense if there's a... No, it won't.
[334:49.06]Whatever.
[334:51.02]I'll make it work.
[335:14.46]I wonder if Burger King should be... Should Burger King be here or Burger King... No, Burger King should be back here then.
[335:19.30]Behind the stairs.
[335:21.77]That'll work.
[335:24.55]Because this opens up to the... This is the bowling alley.
[335:27.63]That's actually better.
[335:29.63]And now this is... Burger King is right here behind the stairs.
[335:34.86]Yep, I get it.
[335:50.13]Okay, so then here's the entrance to the bowling alley.
[335:52.49]I'll put something in paint.
[335:53.79]Doesn't even matter.
[335:55.95]Ugly face alley.
[335:57.11]Whatever.
[335:57.51]It doesn't matter.
[335:58.15]Okay.
[335:58.81]Burger King.
[336:01.30]Have you been to a mall Burger King before?
[336:03.36]Sometimes they are little kiosks like this.
[336:06.98]How far?
[336:07.28]No, it's going to be right there.
[336:20.24]Where is it?
[336:20.86]Up here?
[336:28.86]Okay.
[336:34.79]Yellow and yellow.
[336:36.03]We need yellow and red.
[336:38.33]Yellow and blue.
[336:39.11]Yellow, red, blue.
[336:41.15]I can do that.
[336:41.59]I need the right yellow, though.
[336:50.60]Where is it?
[336:51.16]I mean, it kind of is orange, though.
[336:58.04]It's like this.
[337:11.17]Mike is muted?
[337:12.49]What?
[337:14.40]Why would you... Why would you do... What would you even do that for?
[337:18.78]Why would you... That doesn't make any sense.
[337:20.12]Why would that even happen?
[337:23.61]Of course my microphone's not muted.
[337:26.67]That's so... You guys are so above that.
[337:32.43]Mic... Now I can't even... The game's fucked up in alt tab.
[337:37.92]I actually have to fucking close out of the game now, I think.
[337:40.62]Now I'm good.
[337:45.55]I can't paint this.
[337:51.45]Let's just have light here.
[337:53.44]I got a new painting skill.
[338:02.88]How can I not paint this?
[338:05.39]Shit.
[338:22.05]I need like a hamburger station.
[338:23.32]How am I going to fucking do this?
[338:32.00]Why?
[338:32.22]What do you mean?
[338:32.62]Why is Burger King orange?
[338:34.66]Isn't Burger King orange?
[338:38.27]Isn't Burger King orange inside?
[338:40.55]Oh, hold on.
[338:48.32]Faster painting.
[338:51.52]No, it's not but orange and red?
[338:58.41]I'll deal with that later.
[338:59.67]We gotta finish Hot Topic.
[339:03.37]Okay, so now I need all this to be black too.
[339:09.17]So we need floor tiles.
[339:13.18]Floor surfaces here.
[339:14.30]I don't think they have a black floor unless I go into the
[339:21.54]No, there's not.
[339:22.06]It's going to be tiled floor here.
[339:24.56]Do I have a black tile floor?
[339:27.30]No.
[339:29.46]Well, that's not good.
[339:30.30]This is the darkest it can go, I think.
[339:41.58]Red carpet.
[339:42.58]I can't even do a red carpet.
[339:48.35]Yeah, the purple works, doesn't it?
[339:50.15]Yeah.
[339:54.93]Lord.
[339:57.09]How's this work?
[339:57.81]Yeah, no, this is just... Yeah, that's perfect.
[340:00.68]That's fine.
[340:08.91]Looks good.
[340:19.52]Right to the edge.
[340:20.94]Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[340:23.34]Oh, okay.
[340:24.00]I was about to say, what happened?
[340:27.94]That just freaked me out.
[340:29.90]Alright, so the edge of the store is here.
[340:34.95]There's a red floor.
[340:35.99]Orange.
[340:39.73]Orange.
[340:53.85]There's no real darker floor than this.
[341:00.76]This is going to come right to the wall here and stop right there.
[341:09.79]Right?
[341:12.55]No.
[341:13.45]No, you're wrong.
[341:14.45]You're just so wrong, but it's okay.
[341:15.99]Okay.
[341:24.00]I need the other floor.
[341:30.22]Wish I could put a car in here.

[348:57.58]Well that's D-U-M-G.
[349:15.10]Can't build outside.
[349:16.16]What the fuck are you talking about?
[349:21.19]Yeah, this game hates me right now.
[349:22.57]It does not want me to do what I'm doing.
[349:38.83]Just connect it here.
[349:45.48]The zoning laws?
[349:46.73]The literal zoning laws.
[349:47.81]Alright, that's fine.
[349:57.77]Okay.
[349:58.89]So, this is gonna be the bedroom.
[350:01.55]This is gonna say, do not enter here.
[350:04.13]This is my house.
[350:08.92]Unless you're an employee of this place.
[350:18.27]Hotel.
[350:19.13]Ah, no.
[350:19.49]This doesn't work.
[350:20.93]This doesn't work.
[350:24.07]This is too messy.
[350:25.27]This has to go away.
[350:29.49]A hotel?
[350:30.47]I mean, I guess I could make it a hotel.
[350:32.11]Like a Days Inn?
[350:34.79]When do I make this?
[350:39.41]Alright, let's make it a Days Inn.
[350:45.22]Or a Holiday Inn.
[350:51.70]Just bed.
[350:52.20]We're finishing this up right here.
[350:58.38]By the way, this is the type of shit you'd get at a Holiday Inn Express, by the way.
[351:03.21]Bed with a drawer.
[351:09.09]People just walking up the stairs.
[351:12.47]This bed is fucking ugly.
[351:21.19]Bedding, it's fine.
[351:22.41]Okay, there we go.
[351:27.35]And the bathroom is... Well, the bathroom, you see, you walk out of the Holiday Inn store and you go past the dogs and cats and you dig a shit in the PetSmart.
[351:42.01]Those are your options.
[351:42.81]Alright, what are the colors of a Holiday Inn?
[351:55.68]Holiday Inn Express.
[352:00.62]Green and white.
[352:03.29]Green and white.
[352:03.85]OK, let's save this one.
[352:25.56]And then I need to make something in MS Paint real quick.
[352:30.96]And save it, because it has to go in the front of the house.
[352:50.35]Hold on.
[352:53.95]There we go.
[353:10.46]There it is.
[353:11.76]Save as.
[353:13.10]Just PNG is fine.
[353:14.24]All right.

[354:48.42]That's irritating.
[355:04.84]Dick's Sporting Goods.
[355:05.62]Yeah, that's, uh, yep.
[355:07.56]Good idea.
[355:22.84]Fuck you.
[355:24.64]Stop it.
[355:25.22]Get out of here.
[355:27.06]And I'm only supposed to go to the stairs.
[356:01.88]That's perfect Okay Yeah, it's the neighborhood mall Put it on the right Now because it blocks the hot topic and plus you're like, oh, where are we neighborhood ball?
[356:17.67]By the way, you can't really walk up here if you're to give the crotch Actually, you can't walk.
[356:22.77]No one can walk over here Yes, you can
[356:28.26]PetSmart is a holiday inn.
[356:29.50]Let's get the colors right here and change the floor.
[356:31.54]That has to be carpet.
[356:32.42]This is not correct.
[356:34.96]None of this is fucking correct.
[356:38.36]Store.
[356:41.96]Paints.
[356:43.38]We need that nice green here.
[356:46.10]There it is.
[356:59.25]You went over somebody's house and there was this shit in their living room.
[357:14.04]Yeah, this whole thing has to be green.
[357:17.60]Oh, fuck right.
[357:18.36]This is their property.
[357:19.66]I can't touch that.
[357:21.50]Nah, yeah, I can.
[357:22.22]It's shared.
[357:22.76]That's his Holiday Inn property.
[357:25.66]We just, we have an agreement.
[357:34.86]violating the rules here.
[357:37.53]It's fine.
[357:45.93]Please stop before you get hurt?
[357:47.47]What?
[357:53.96]I'm gonna fall down the stairs?
[358:03.58]Let's paint these walls.
[358:06.42]Good, good, good.
[358:09.11]Looking sleek.
[358:13.35]You know, I could make this a Holiday Inn H&R Block combo platter.
[358:16.61]What do you think?
[358:20.17]Put the H&R Block over here and the Holiday Inn over here.
[358:34.99]It's too full.
[358:36.97]It's too full.
[358:37.91]You have to stop.
[358:39.96]Ow, I'm sorry.
[358:40.50]I just bumped the mic.
[358:52.05]Looks good there.
[358:52.91]Okay, Holiday Inn.
[359:02.55]I missed a spot.
[359:03.24]Where?
[359:05.66]I don't see a damn thing.
[359:08.92]Got it.
[359:09.18]All right.
[359:11.56]So... I didn't get over here.
[359:14.28]Hold on.
[359:18.28]There's that.
[359:18.86]This needs, like, a desk or something in here.
[359:20.86]Otherwise, it is just a bed.
[359:23.24]I need a nice, like... We'll do white for the carpet.
[359:28.34]Floor panels and coverings.
[359:30.78]This, like, beige carpet is fine.
[359:40.58]We need a little desk lamp in here.
[359:42.52]Otherwise it's not homey.
[359:51.07]Got it all right.
[359:51.89]Okay, then this has to change in here.
[359:56.77]PetSmart.
[359:57.17]What is a PetSmart?
[359:57.75]Ground carpet, right?
[360:01.75]Go with the blue carpet.
[360:03.93]It always works out when you do blue in PetSmart.
[360:08.84]What am I talking about?
[360:09.76]It always works out when you do blue in PetSmart.
[360:14.34]I've lost all motor functions.
[360:17.78]Yeah, PetSmart's blue.
[360:33.01]Or Spider-Man, however you want to look at it.
[360:36.64]Alright.
[360:38.18]So... How we doing?
[360:41.51]That's better.
[360:45.35]Bathroom, carpet, pet store?
[360:46.79]Yes.
[360:48.31]I mean, this technically is not... This needs to be wood, because this is part of the walkway here.
[360:52.37]This is part of the walking around section.
[361:01.16]Once you get up, you can't get out.
[361:02.90]You're stuck here forever.
[361:03.90]Have fun at the mall.
[361:19.94]There.
[361:20.52]Separate.
[361:21.36]There it is.
[361:24.19]Ice cream.
[361:25.25]PetSmart.
[361:26.01]Holiday Inn.
[361:29.17]This has to be destroyed.
[361:34.59]Wait a minute.
[361:34.99]Hold on.
[361:35.81]Hold on a second here.
[361:37.94]Can I... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[361:40.82]Can this be put up like this?
[361:47.54]Damn it.
[361:47.88]No.
[361:49.94]I have to move it over.
[361:57.83]You spent three hours on this house?
[361:59.69]Oh, I know.
[362:01.05]I'm aware.
[362:04.43]Do I have to be proud of what I'm doing?
[362:08.61]Where'd it go?
[362:09.21]Right there.
[362:14.73]I need one more little slab.
[362:21.89]Still missed a spot after three hours.
[362:23.87]I probably missed a lot of spots.
[362:29.54]No, that's not right.
[362:35.04]Okay, that's better.
[362:35.72]Can I actually walk up and down now?
[362:40.66]Yes.
[362:42.96]I need lights.
[362:43.90]Better lights.
[362:45.01]Come on, man.
[362:49.17]Even Burger King has more lights.
[362:52.60]I got to turn on the heat lamps.
[362:53.74]What am I thinking?
[362:57.97]Okay.
[362:59.71]Let's get those recessed lights.
[363:06.34]Hot topic won't be empty for long.
[363:07.62]Don't worry.
[363:10.66]Let's go with here.
[363:27.49]Let me tell you guys.
[363:29.21]I'm loving it.
[363:31.37]McDonald's.
[363:32.65]McDonald's right here.
[363:35.65]Back here.
[363:36.29]In the corner.
[363:41.03]Okay, hot topic.
[363:41.83]What's in hot topic?
[363:42.59]A bunch of shit.
[363:43.85]A bunch of weird stuff.
[363:45.29]Here's the lights.
[363:46.19]Colorful lights.
[363:46.83]I'm just going to fucking put these everywhere.
[363:52.33]And we're never going to turn them on.
[364:01.65]Okay, now we need... We need some other weird shit here.
[364:07.28]Hold on.
[364:10.86]We need, like, one light that actually works on the corners.
[364:17.40]Put the toilet in here.
[364:20.70]Oh, shit, no.
[364:21.44]I can't even turn these on.
[364:24.46]If I flick the switch here, they're all gonna turn on, aren't they?
[364:36.66]What happens if I do this now?
[364:39.30]It's going to look real odd.
[364:48.43]Nope.
[364:51.27]Wait a minute.
[364:51.61]Hold on.
[364:53.17]Can I put the switch here?
[364:54.17]Like connected to this?
[365:02.57]We're just going to have to do one of these.
[365:09.06]How about now?
[365:14.38]That's a little better.
[365:15.00]Let's put them in the corners.
[365:21.07]That thing's got to go, though.
[365:33.21]One more light in the corner.
[365:37.78]These mini ones are probably best for the ambient look.
[365:41.82]Yeah.
[365:47.95]Perfect.
[365:48.29]All right.
[365:48.75]Now we just need a bunch of cupboards in here because that's how they sell clothes.
[365:53.53]Everything else doesn't matter.
[365:55.61]Just a bunch of black cabinets.
[366:05.93]You can't see them though.
[366:07.35]That defeats the whole purpose.
[366:10.35]Did he put boots everywhere?
[366:11.81]Yeah, there has to be a bunch of boots.
[366:31.47]Can I put shirts on?
[366:32.37]I don't think I can put shirts on the wall.
[366:37.20]Oh, you better believe that there's gonna be a wall of gas masks.
[366:43.87]Shelf.
[366:52.57]Can't be this color though.
[367:01.14]Right here.
[367:05.27]Place where you can actually see it.
[367:06.39]We'll light it up too.
[367:07.11]Right here.
[367:25.13]Put a nice light on it.
[367:41.42]Okay.
[367:46.87]Looks alright.
[367:48.35]Now we just need a couple of wardrobes.
[367:55.06]No, it is not.
[367:56.16]I can't even say it out loud.
[368:11.87]A BDSM store.
[368:21.39]Why can't I move?
[368:23.39]Why is my keyboard fucking up?
[368:29.94]They sell speakers at Hot Topic.
[368:31.98]Buy one.
[368:32.44]Alright, now I just need some cupboards.
[368:37.74]Just some brass...
[368:42.30]I mean, we can't even see them, though.
[368:43.60]Alright, here's like your pool table.
[368:47.61]Table.
[368:50.65]Right?
[368:51.67]Pool table?
[368:54.06]No, this is like a weird swanky little seat, though.
[368:56.64]I can see that being there.
[369:11.14]Definitely.
[369:11.66]Okay.
[369:11.95]Now we just need a stick.
[369:13.81]We need cupboards.
[369:14.67]These are going to have to do.
[369:21.53]Steel.
[369:22.53]No.
[369:24.60]Gray.
[369:24.94]Gray will pick up.
[369:25.68]At least you'll be able to see them.
[369:35.18]Otherwise, they'll end up popping up on screen.
[369:47.62]I can barely move.
[369:48.62]Is it my keyboard that's doing this shit?
[369:52.86]Okay, that looks good.
[369:53.60]You can buy your t-shirts in here.
[369:59.74]All your posters, Kingdom Hearts.
[370:01.27]I need to light those up a little more though.
[370:08.67]Let's get like a tube up there.
[370:22.46]Should I put them up or down or below?
[370:24.26]I mean, seriously, it seems like... No.
[370:27.40]Definitely above.
[370:34.78]Alright.
[370:35.00]I don't like those.
[370:42.06]Miss you, Hot Topic.
[370:43.58]Best Buy.
[370:46.60]Burger King.
[370:48.10]I think we're done.
[370:49.90]I'm pretty sure the neighborhood mall is done.
[370:53.94]This is the bowling alley, but you don't need a logo for this.
[370:57.00]Alright, let's do a final tour.
[371:03.12]Let's go outside.
[371:10.43]So as you can see, my house is simply a normal house on the outside.
[371:16.45]In a nice neighborhood.
[371:17.27]But once you go in, I've turned my house into a mall.
[371:22.52]Okay, so you come on in.
[371:23.46]This is the neighborhood mall.
[371:25.03]Make sure you close the door behind you.
[371:27.43]Hot Topic on the right.
[371:29.33]Followed by Best Buy.
[371:32.11]All kinds of weird shit is in here.
[371:33.41]You can get your favorite video game t-shirts.
[371:36.98]You can get Mario smoking a joint in here on a shirt.
[371:41.70]Or Fight Club.
[371:42.42]Remember that movie Tyler Durden punched himself in the fucking face, dude?
[371:47.83]That was probably really loud.
[371:48.65]I'm sorry.
[371:50.41]And here's your, like, fetish shit, if you want it.
[371:53.03]In case you want that.
[371:57.04]Best Buy sells computers, TVs, mice, gaming rigs.
[372:05.18]That's a pretty good store.
[372:06.04]Burger King here, in case you get hungry, want a little snack.
[372:10.04]Make sure these are on.
[372:11.11]Yes, they are.
[372:11.89]Pickles.
[372:13.51]Fork and knife, for those of you that want it.
[372:16.39]Dirty over here, though.
[372:19.03]People can't eat over here like this.
[372:26.26]Get the mop out.
[372:26.94]No, that's not a mop.
[372:33.30]Okay.
[372:34.58]Burger King.
[372:35.78]To the left here, you've got the bowling alley.
[372:39.47]Punching you and your friend.
[372:40.99]Up to four people can play.
[372:42.11]Here's your seat.

[372:44.63]There's your...
[372:56.09]Okay.

[373:02.19]So again, here's the ball.
[373:03.19]Ball down the lane.
[373:03.95]Here are your pins.
[373:07.72]Looks good.
[373:08.62]I don't... What are these doing here?
[373:11.96]I didn't want that.
[373:13.76]Here's the coffee maker in case you get thirsty.
[373:15.42]You want a burnt coffee, there's plenty for you there.
[373:18.32]And then if you take a right over here...
[373:23.50]On the second level of our mall.
[373:24.54]That's right, it's a two-layer mall.

[376:15.26]Something's not right.
[376:17.91]Sorry, but I'm single, so I don't need two bedrooms.
[376:22.37]A big bedroom, how sweet.

[377:02.29]Furniture sold.
[377:03.87]House price.
[377:05.45]Renovation cost.
[377:06.15]It was like $20,000. $20,000?
[377:09.32]I made money.
[377:09.84]That's $63,000.
[377:10.92]All right, make me an offer I can't refuse.
[377:16.07]An extra $57,000.
[377:19.75]Ha ha, no, get lost.
[377:29.59]The mall made a profit.
[377:36.68]All right, we'll keep it.
[377:39.37]In fact, let's move in.
[377:44.49]I'm moving in.
[377:47.57]How do I make this my new house?
[377:48.77]You have to add a toilet to the fetish section of Hot Topic.
[378:05.90]Gotta go back to the laptop.
[378:08.16]Alright, back to the office.
[378:10.60]Making this the office, no?
[378:12.22]And then we're selling the shack.
[378:22.16]So this is the office here.
[378:26.49]Oh, it was there.
[378:27.01]What about the bunker house?
[378:31.45]That thing sucked.
[378:32.11]That thing was a piece of shit.
[378:38.63]Oh, move office here.
[378:42.16]You just selected a new office.
[378:43.22]From now on, it's your new office.
[378:44.42]Only you have to select a place for your laptop.
[378:48.10]Where's your laptop going to go?
[378:50.62]I know where it's going to go because it's the perfect place for it.
[378:54.30]Right there.
[378:56.39]Where you punch the names in.
[379:03.37]Oh, I love it.
[379:08.74]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[379:10.24]Hold on a second there.
[379:11.74]What is this?
[379:12.52]I didn't do that.
[379:18.76]And that's gonna be it.
[379:24.30]Ruined.
[379:25.38]He finally noticed.
[379:27.46]It only took him four hours.
[379:30.55]I think we did good here.
[379:31.99]I like this place.
[379:34.41]I'd be glad to sell all kinds of products here.
[379:45.95]Alright.
[380:04.55]Alright, well, I think that's gonna be it.
[380:10.61]That's the end.
[380:13.79]And this is probably gonna be the...
[380:16.64]Last time you see House Flipper.
[380:23.70]I think we got all we could out of it.
[380:24.91]Because this is the second most expensive house in the game.
[380:33.27]And unless I want to make a second mall, we probably are going to wrap up this game.
[380:43.11]But it's a lot of fun.
[380:47.64]Like we talked about before, I really hope in an update.
[380:51.22]Okay, here's how I'll come back to this game.
[380:54.32]If they update the game to allow you to kind of just start from scratch and actually build a house, then I will absolutely come back and play it.
[381:08.21]You give me the tools necessary to build a real fake 3D Sims house?
[381:12.39]Yes.
[381:12.57]Yes.
[381:15.63]Then this game becomes... That's a whole other level.
[381:23.82]But that's going to be it.
[381:25.44]I will see you guys not tomorrow.
[381:27.58]I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[381:31.56]There are a few options.
[381:33.06]I'm not exactly sure what we're going to do on Thursday.
[381:35.93]But there are at least three or four things that are possible.
[381:41.08]It's just Minecraft.
[381:42.00]Well, it's not literally Minecraft.
[381:43.82]It's a different version of those types of games.
[381:49.67]But before you go, if you have not voted on the emotes, the emote contest is closing on Friday.
[381:59.49]So you will no longer be able to vote on that poll on Friday.
[382:04.10]So if you could, go ahead and check it out.
[382:07.22]Vote for your five favorites.
[382:09.44]Please and thank you.
[382:12.01]You said you play Holdfast.
[382:13.05]Yeah, that's definitely an option.
[382:18.73]So, thank you so much, everybody.
[382:21.51]We're going to do the credits now.
[382:25.01]I'm going to exit this game.
[382:30.65]And move this out of the way.
[382:33.53]But good night.
[382:34.09]It is getting a little late here, so try to go through this as fast as we can.
[382:40.50]And I do mean that for real.
[382:43.38]I do mean that for real, because it is like 12.15.
[382:44.64]And we've been going for about six and a half hours, so let's do it, huh?
[382:49.06]Credits.
[382:50.80]Roll them.
[382:51.84]Thank you, everybody, for all the new subs and the resubs.

[385:22.07]Thanks a lot, guys.
[385:33.42]What did I miss?
[385:35.04]That was too fast.
[385:35.76]And I'm sorry, you guys probably realize by now, the more people that subscribe during a stream, the faster that goes.
[385:43.03]Because apparently somehow in the settings, and I've tried to fix this, maybe my brain is too small.
[385:49.89]But if there are less subs, it goes slower.
[385:53.75]So the more subs there are, sometimes it just blasts by the screen.
[386:02.72]thank you though everybody sorry that I fucked up your names and I may have missed a person I hope I didn't but if I did tell me you need to stop reading so close to the top it's not good for your anxiety it's impossible it's impossible there's too many words too many letters and numbers can I make the credits slower I've tried and it just I I'm gonna try again would I recommend house flipper
[386:32.90]Yeah, I think so.
[386:36.52]You need to know exactly what you're getting, though.
[386:41.50]It's just a game of sort of mundane tasks.
[386:45.74]Cleaning up, dusting things, cleaning windows, painting walls.
[386:53.68]If you like that kind of background game, just to relax and chill and paint a few walls, yeah, I think so.
[387:07.54]But let's do the bits now.
[387:12.20]Before it gets too late for everybody.
[387:17.11]Let's get down here.
[387:17.97]We're actually going to try to do these very quickly.
[387:20.67]Because I don't want to keep people up for much longer.
[387:23.29]Spreo, thanks for the one dollar.
[387:25.53]The face you make when you find out you turned into a seagull.
[387:30.35]Oh.
[387:31.39]It's me.
[387:34.64]Thank you.
[387:35.54]Thank you, uh, Suprio, for the... Is that a seagull?
[387:38.36]That is a seagull.
[387:38.98]Okay, make sure that wasn't a pigeon.
[387:40.92]CluelessSniper, thanks for the $1.
[387:42.14]Hey, Jerma, love the new Landscaper.
[387:44.36]He seems like a nice guy.
[387:45.24]I hope we see more of him.
[387:46.22]P.S.
[387:46.50]Please show us your Fireman shirt.
[387:48.30]What?
[387:50.36]Love the new Landscaper?
[387:52.65]Who's that?
[387:54.05]Show us your Fireman shirt.
[387:55.81]I don't have access to it right now.
[387:56.89]It's in the car.
[387:58.50]I haven't taken it out of the car.
[388:00.58]It's in the backseat of my car.
[388:03.10]And I haven't taken it out.
[388:08.63]Still, yeah, I have not taken it out.
[388:10.33]I'm not even kidding.
[388:14.19]It's in the backseat.
[388:18.80]Show it.
[388:19.42]That's so sad.
[388:20.88]Go get it.
[388:22.90]Go get it right now.
[388:24.42]All right, hold on.
[388:25.28]Just hold on a minute.
[388:27.06]We're supposed to do this quick.
[388:27.90]I'm going to do this quick.
[388:28.48]I'm going to get the shirt right now.
[388:29.76]I'll be right back.
[388:31.02]It's going to be 60 seconds starting now.
[389:08.99]you
[389:43.90]you
[390:18.81]you
[390:58.74]7, 58, 59, 60.
[391:00.30]All right, made it.
[391:05.70]So, here it is.
[391:10.50]Take a look.
[391:13.52]Fireman.
[391:16.37]I'm really sweaty.
[391:17.67]Forget it.
[391:23.55]I'm sweating in this room.
[391:26.63]Look at that, dude.
[391:28.69]Don't put it on, you'll die.
[391:30.70]What?
[391:30.90]Is it cursed?
[391:32.62]Oh yeah, that's right.
[391:33.20]He told me not to wear it.
[391:33.94]I think that's why I left it in the car.
[391:35.50]Fuck, get this out of my house.
[391:36.94]Get it out of my house.
[391:37.58]I don't want this in my house.
[391:38.96]He told me that it was like a cursed shirt.
[391:40.16]Why did I just get that?
[391:41.38]I left it in there for a reason.
[391:42.46]Now I'm remembering why I left it in there.
[391:45.45]Ah, fuck.
[391:46.09]Whatever.
[391:46.37]Alright, let's go.
[391:54.34]Thank you SFC for the five dollars Hello, Jeremy someone on the subreddit made this piece of art and I'm going to hear your thoughts about it That's great, I mean is it a piece of art or did you put my face on somebody else's face That's it All right, it's died Star Trek Star Trek school show I
[392:22.05]Alright, thanks a lot, man.
[392:23.07]Appreciate it.
[392:23.57]Thanks for the $5, SFC.
[392:25.27]Snoozycopter, thanks for the $1.
[392:26.51]We had a dog for 10 years until he died earlier this year.
[392:30.59]We got him when I was maybe 5 years old.
[392:34.47]Currently, I sit at home most of my time and now I want to get a puppy.
[392:37.99]Can you encourage or discourage my choice?
[392:43.33]I'm a huge advocate of get a dog and always have a dog in your life.
[392:49.65]Dogs just seriously...
[392:52.46]just your best friend and they always want to hang out with you I I will always have a dog in my life no matter what so I would tell you to have a dog for sure they can help with a lot of problems but yeah that's what I would say a dog has never made a situation worse that's true joe that is absolutely a perfect statement
[393:19.21]But thank you, Snoozen.
[393:20.03]Good luck, and I'm sorry to hear about your dog earlier this year.
[393:22.96]That sucks.
[393:27.19]But thank you.
[393:27.83]Thank you again for the $1, Snoozen.
[393:28.79]Copter.
[393:30.86]Also, can I get a pat on my back for not telling anyone, even though talking to both of you had heard plans about that at PAX.
[393:37.62]You heard all the plans.
[393:38.26]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[393:38.90]That's right.
[393:40.48]Me and Star were at PAX, and there was only like three people, or two people, I think, and you were one of them, that we really told we were going to do that.
[393:50.41]So you did.
[393:51.11]You did a great job.
[393:52.81]You kept your mouth closed for four months.
[393:57.93]Three and a half months.
[394:01.13]So thank you for that.
[394:04.37]Thank you.
[394:07.39]Thank you, Flank Tank, for the $1.
[394:08.70]When you get to Vegas, you should house flip.
[394:10.76]Build another room so Stir and Ashley can come move in with you and Italics and Kim.
[394:14.22]Does this have a giant house?
[394:20.18]You think about that.
[394:22.23]You're talking about needing eight bedrooms.
[394:26.91]Let's break that down, right?
[394:28.96]so I a bedroom from for italics a bedroom for me bedroom for star and ashley uh by the way forget about the bedrooms each one of us streams we all need a separate room to stream in we're not going to stream this that's another that's three more rooms that's six at least six bedrooms that's that's a potential six or seven bedroom house
[394:57.46]No, I'm talking about just shared space.
[395:00.79]Star and Ashley have a room.
[395:03.89]We're talking about shared space here.
[395:06.89]Me and Kim wouldn't be in separate bedrooms.
[395:12.09]You aren't a millionaire with streaming.
[395:13.96]No.
[395:15.36]No.
[395:18.22]Is the madman still streaming?
[395:19.58]Yes.
[395:19.92]We're talking about seven, eight bedroom houses.
[395:26.02]Just buy an old mall and flip it into a house.
[395:32.97]But, yeah.
[395:34.75]Be interesting.
[395:36.87]Would be interesting.
[395:38.59]Thank you, flank tank, though.
[395:39.40]Thank you, eefs, for the dollar.
[395:40.58]Not the dollar.
[395:41.28]The dollar times ten.
[395:42.12]Thanks for the ten dollars, eefs.
[395:43.92]Ten fifty.
[395:45.56]The Jerma Star Stream made my entire month, just so you know.
[395:48.72]Love you, Jerma.
[395:49.26]But I also think I found a place that is a nuclear bomb-sized bird explosion.
[395:54.24]10 million times the bird explosion room in Detroit Become Human.
[395:58.39]It's an island in Scotland called Bass Rock.
[396:02.03]Take a look.
[396:03.45]Bass Rock?
[396:03.97]No, not Bass Rock.
[396:05.55]Bass Rock.
[396:10.89]What the fuck?
[396:13.59]Oh, those are all birds?
[396:15.87]what all of these are birds those aren't flowers see what you're telling me that this this is not a bed of a bunch of those are all birds is the lighthouse made of the birds too huh well that's insane I'd want to just go there and just watch that's probably crazy
[396:44.76]But thank you, eefs.
[396:46.52]And, yeah.
[396:48.44]I'm glad that we could do that stream.
[396:49.80]It was a lot of fun.
[396:51.84]Snoozercopter, thanks for the $1.
[396:53.02]Also, also, you're finally going to do the Clown of the Town now.
[396:56.22]Since Star has all that money.
[396:58.68]Was that the plan the whole time?
[397:01.50]No, we're not going to do Clown of the Town.
[397:03.41]Clown of the Town is... Clown of the Town is illegal and would require, like, five dozen city permits.
[397:12.98]We would have to... Ben Affleck would have to be standing with us to have that be a thing.
[397:19.04]We would have to get the mayor, the governor, two senators to say that that would be okay, and Ben Affleck would have to be there too, and be like, yeah, it's me, it's fine.
[397:28.43]It'll never happen.
[397:33.07]Bird poop mountain.
[397:35.61]Vegas might agree to clown the town.
[397:39.53]You know, if there's one place that would probably be alright, that would be the one place, I would say.
[397:47.27]But thank you, smelly boy, for the $1.
[397:48.77]Can we expect more stir content now?
[397:52.86]Um... Yeah, I mean, there never was a reason to think that it would never happen again.
[398:01.78]It's just... He got really into...
[398:06.77]D&D and Overwatch.
[398:08.49]And I didn't.
[398:09.83]In fact, I don't enjoy either one of those things.
[398:14.59]So, I went this way and he went that way.
[398:18.01]There was no reason why we couldn't have done content together, but we both just did completely separate things.
[398:26.00]I just stopped playing Overwatch and I don't play D&D and I don't care about it.
[398:34.88]I think it's great, I think it's an awesome concept, and it's paved the way for every video game you've ever fucking played, especially RPGs, but I just don't like to play D&D.
[398:47.95]And it's a lot easier, something that I think a lot of people need to realize, is it's so much easier to hang out and talk to people that are doing the same fucking thing that you are.
[399:00.34]They're into the same things, they're doing the same things.
[399:03.52]Look at, like, YouTube, right?
[399:05.12]The reason why me and Star, me and Italics, me and Boo, me and MLC Stealth, any of these people, is because we were all making the same kinds of YouTube videos.
[399:15.14]We were YouTubers.
[399:16.92]Me and Star even played the same damn game.
[399:19.18]We made videos on the same game.
[399:22.87]So, that's... We shared a bunch of common interests.
[399:28.69]And unfortunately, sometimes, you find other things that you like to do, and the other person and the other people just don't want to be a part of it, because they don't really, they're not into it.
[399:45.42]But, I feel like enough time has passed, where it's, we can just, whatever, we'll just do some, like, random stream sometime.
[399:54.00]We've already talked about a couple of things that we would do for fun.
[400:01.25]Sometimes the tubes fork out.
[400:09.93]And also, we've touched upon this before too.
[400:15.37]Besides Star and Italic sometimes, I don't do a whole lot of multiplayer stuff to begin with.
[400:23.24]Unless sometimes it's with a lot of people in chat like you guys.
[400:27.78]Me and Star played all the time.
[400:30.39]It was just very convenient because we both enjoyed the same shit.
[400:32.89]We both cared about the same things.
[400:37.34]And it's... It's not like... I'm always going around looking for multiplayer experiences with other streamers and YouTubers.
[400:49.53]But... You know.
[400:53.23]There will absolutely be more streams with Star.
[400:56.53]There will.
[400:59.17]We wouldn't have planned to do the thing that we did two days ago.
[401:05.01]Or three, whatever it was, three days ago now.
[401:07.04]If we weren't going to follow it up and do more stuff.
[401:10.24]We just wanted to both make sure that we were in a position to want to do it and be ready to do it and think it was fun to do it again.
[401:19.00]That's all it is.
[401:19.56]That's all it takes.
[401:23.27]But, what do you say we move on?
[401:26.01]That's all I'll say about that.
[401:29.15]everything's everything's golden everything's good we'll go moving on is good yes all right so uh thank you to xx it's rudy thank you for the five dollars he says stermacon 2020
[401:49.90]I ain't paying for it, but thank you.
[401:51.18]Thank you, Stormychoo, for the $45.
[401:52.66]I missed this.
[401:53.70]Apparently.
[401:55.76]Stormychoo, thank you for the $45 earlier.
[401:57.73]This was, like, a long time ago now.
[402:00.83]Thank you so much, man.
[402:02.05]Uh, they say, I hope you're having a good day.
[402:04.23]There's something I've always wanted to ask you.
[402:05.57]What's your favorite RPG class?
[402:07.46]Arch-type.
[402:09.90]Um...
[402:14.74]I really like the spellcasters.
[402:18.88]I'm into mages.
[402:20.44]I think they're really interesting, really fun to play.
[402:25.96]So I'd pick a mage.
[402:33.35]Or... Yeah, no, no, no.
[402:37.71]I'm not going to change the answer.
[402:38.85]Mage.
[402:39.05]Mage.
[402:41.53]But thank you, Stormichu, for the $45.
[402:43.29]Dude, that's a lot of money.
[402:44.43]Thank you.
[402:45.47]Sorry I missed that earlier.
[402:47.77]Flank Tank, thanks for the $1.
[402:48.69]Also, I'm glad you haven't died of... He said something about my ligaments being... Something about I had, like, bad ligaments.
[402:57.84]It's very dangerous and contagious.
[402:59.78]Be sure to wash your hands.
[403:01.78]I will.
[403:03.38]Thank you.
[403:05.00]I will take care of my joints.
[403:07.17]Toaster, thank you.
[403:08.47]And Jazz Jelly, thank you for the $1.
[403:11.31]Hi.
[403:11.93]Hi.
[403:14.07]Thank you, Toaster.
[403:14.69]Thank you, Jazz Jelly.
[403:15.41]Thank you, Sticks.
[403:16.07]Renegade for the $1.
[403:18.53]Couple things.
[403:19.25]One, you still don't remember.
[403:20.39]No.
[403:22.39]Explain the Monster Rancher 2 Way Past Cool thumbnail.
[403:27.52]And then three, you were diagnosed also with bad ligaments.
[403:32.24]I'm sorry to hear that.
[403:34.94]Let me explain the thumbnail.
[403:37.51]Way past cool.
[403:38.29]Let me just see what... Let me refresh my memory.
[403:42.32]Let's see.
[403:42.58]What's the thumbnail?
[403:43.84]Okay.
[403:45.86]Uh, it's Tim Allen.
[403:48.87]It's Tim Allen.
[403:49.43]That's the Tim Allen sub-song.
[403:50.71]That's where it came from.
[404:07.24]I'm looking at the thumbnail.
[404:08.28]Yes, it's Tim Allen with his feet in the air and a hammer in his hand.
[404:11.72]I don't know.
[404:14.36]I don't know what this is.
[404:15.89]I didn't make this.
[404:18.21]I have no idea what this is.
[404:34.53]I didn't sign off on that.
[404:35.94]A likely story.
[404:42.56]ToasterOven said, I made two planets for you.
[404:45.88]They're on Twitter.
[404:48.45]Oh, cool.
[404:50.19]I'll give them a look.
[404:50.73]Thanks, man.
[404:53.83]It was outsourced.
[404:56.41]Thank you, Sticks.
[404:57.61]I don't know what I'm supposed to remember.
[404:59.80]Sorry about your ligaments.

[405:25.91]No, no, no, we're not talking about Tim Allen.
[405:27.95]Not Tim Allen.
[405:29.17]We're talking about this ligament and sun-dried tomato thing that people keep saying.
[405:34.41]Who made that up?
[405:36.30]I need to speak with them.
[405:48.04]What do you mean?
[405:50.54]It was a prank.
[405:54.88]Somebody pranked somebody.
[405:56.72]Of course they did.
[406:04.88]I'll be speaking with them.
[406:10.39]I'm just going to say, hey man.
[406:13.27]What's going on there?
[406:15.57]And that's it.
[406:16.75]I will expect a 9 to 15, 20 to 30 paragraph statement as to why.
[406:28.64]But thank you.
[406:29.90]Thank you, Malcolm in the middle.
[406:30.74]Thanks for the $1.
[406:31.53]Thank you, Based Grandpa, again, for the $50.
[406:33.15]I'm not going to say it.
[406:35.29]Thank you for the $50 up, Based Grandpa.
[406:36.99]Appreciate it.
[406:37.93]A lot of money.
[406:38.39]We touched on it earlier.
[406:39.15]We'll touch upon it again.
[406:40.05]Thank you so much.
[406:42.85]Joe Bo, thanks for the $5, Joe Bo.
[406:44.49]Jeremy, we love your vids.
[406:45.55]Here in England, we've actually dedicated a day to you.
[406:48.53]So sad to hear about that word that I will never say.
[406:52.38]Thank you.
[406:53.04]Sorry.
[406:53.60]Thank you.
[406:54.18]Thank you.
[406:54.72]Sorry.
[406:55.34]Thank you, Joe.
[406:57.03]Thank you, Bourbon Burger, for the $1.
[406:58.85]Again, just says that word that I'm not gonna say.
[407:01.55]Bourbon Burger, again, thanks for the $1.
[407:03.21]Appreciate it.
[407:05.87]Kill Ganon, thanks for the $1.
[407:08.33]Derma, that thing is a made-up disease, people said.
[407:11.17]And it was a hoax.
[407:18.12]What?
[407:22.82]Wait, hold on a second.
[407:29.25]Wait, this is a made-up illness.
[407:36.33]What?
[407:38.51]This doesn't even make any sense.
[407:45.93]This is by far... Oh my god.
[407:50.81]It's about a ninja.
[407:52.51]Somebody made up a fake illness.
[407:55.51]Okay.
[407:56.29]I'm just gonna push that one into the fucking...
[408:00.48]Push that one away here.
[408:04.12]Oh, God.
[408:05.46]What the fuck?
[408:11.06]Somebody was trolling my teacher about it.
[408:14.44]No, no, stop it.
[408:16.68]Stop it.
[408:18.60]I want you to take a deep breath right now, and I want you to just breathe out, and I want you to stop it, okay?
[408:32.06]Don't troll your teacher.
[408:33.98]Don't go to the McDonald's drive-suit and say, oh, hey, hey, that word.
[408:37.88]Hey, look at me.
[408:38.72]And they're going to be like, huh?
[408:40.93]What do you want?
[408:41.41]What do you want for food?
[408:42.39]You're going to be like, hey, I got you, motherfucker.
[408:45.05]And then you're going to drive away.
[408:46.13]Don't do that.
[408:46.67]Don't stop it.
[408:47.31]Don't do it.
[408:47.73]Don't do it anymore.
[408:48.93]You're going to call the local restaurant, your local favorite restaurant.
[408:56.31]Hey, what do you think about...
[408:59.22]That word.
[409:00.10]And they're not going to know what the fuck you're talking about.
[409:04.59]Go garden.
[409:05.27]You know, go take care of some bees.
[409:10.89]Go water some plants.
[409:14.01]Go put on a sun hat and just go out there and like plant a couple of trees.
[409:25.87]Go make a mall in a house.
[409:28.60]Alright, we gotta go.
[409:29.24]We gotta move on.
[409:31.49]But thank you, Kilganon, for clearing that up.
[409:32.93]I appreciate that.
[409:33.69]Multitrip, thanks for the $50.
[409:36.31]Thank you.
[409:37.91]Huge money.
[409:40.63]Thank you so much, dude.
[409:41.69]Touched upon it earlier, but again, thank you so much for that fucking huge amount of money.
[409:46.81]Kill Ganon, thanks for the $1.
[409:48.03]What's my favorite flavor of... They're using a... There's a bad word here.
[409:54.77]My favorite... I'll tell you what my favorite ice cream flavor is.
[409:56.57]It's probably strawberry.
[409:59.16]I love it.
[410:01.18]A Styx Renegade, thanks for the $1.
[410:03.52]I spilled my entire cup of hot green tea on my carpet, and now I'm sad.
[410:07.96]Let's turn it into a bowling alley, and nobody will even care.
[410:10.98]Thank you, Styx.
[410:12.54]Thank you, Hawkeye of Mine, thanks for the $4.
[410:15.73]Interesting you say that, Hawkeye, first of all.
[410:48.19]I'm sorry to hear about that condition.
[410:50.09]That sucks.
[410:52.18]And yeah.
[410:55.04]Going out to Las Vegas, there are a lot of places where you can kind of just get in a car, get on a bike, and just go and just get lost out in the desert.
[411:07.71]There's tons of beautiful places, tons of canyons to explore, places to drive.
[411:16.69]As long as you don't go too far and don't get too lost.
[411:20.57]Then yeah, it can actually be a great thing to clear your head.
[411:26.02]Why would you go outside in Las Vegas?
[411:31.26]Streamer encourages viewers to get lost in the desert and die.
[411:34.16]What?
[411:35.08]I'm just... You're putting things in my mouth that I don't want in there.
[411:40.17]You're putting these words that I don't want in there.
[411:42.59]And I'm trying to spit them out.
[411:47.19]I love the weather in Vegas.
[411:49.69]The weather in Vegas is awesome.
[411:51.31]It's 110 degrees and it's like 4% humidity.
[411:54.86]It's perfect.
[411:56.68]I would, I love it.
[411:57.96]I hope I turn to dust out there, honestly.
[412:06.67]It's dry.
[412:07.29]Good.
[412:07.77]All you need to just drink some water and put moisturizer on your face.
[412:12.39]Just take, like, some Cetaphil and just smear it all over your body, head to toe, and then go outside and drink a bunch of water and ride your bike in the desert.
[412:21.05]Just be careful.
[412:22.58]And don't do anything crazy.
[412:25.20]Watch out for snakes and watch out for scorpions.
[412:26.70]Watch out for, uh, septifuges.
[412:28.94]What are they called?
[412:29.74]A septifuge.
[412:33.74]What are they called?
[412:35.05]Sulpugids.
[412:37.21]Watch out for the sulpugids.
[412:39.21]They're apparently very... What did I say?
[412:40.33]Scepterfuge?
[412:41.29]Scepterfuge.
[412:43.63]A Sulpugid.
[412:45.75]Sulpugid.
[412:50.70]The Camel Spider.
[412:52.10]Camel Spider.
[412:52.66]I got it.
[412:53.02]It was close.
[412:54.80]Thank you, though.
[412:56.24]I'm glad you can experience some wanderlust and get lost and have fun.
[413:03.67]I would probably do the same thing a few times.
[413:08.51]It's a sun spider.
[413:09.65]Sulpugid.
[413:11.32]Sun scorpion.
[413:13.10]Camel spider.
[413:17.88]You're not googling that?
[413:19.02]They're cute.
[413:19.92]They just look like birds.
[413:21.66]They're like crab bird spiders.
[413:24.53]They're terrifying.
[413:25.13]I'm just trying to make myself feel better that I'm going to see them all the time.
[413:28.11]So, don't mind me.
[413:32.46]But thank you, Hawkeye, of mine, for the $4.
[413:34.11]Thank you, Garfield, the Monday Killer, for the $1.
[413:36.55]He's a fat cat, a cool cat.
[413:38.85]It's your main cat, Garfield.
[413:39.95]Happy Saturday, Jerma.
[413:41.62]Saturday.
[413:42.68]Today's Wednesday.
[413:44.28]Garfield usually has a joke or a comic, but it's time for Garfield to get real, as much as I pull your leg.
[413:49.95]Hey, thank you.
[413:50.33]Thank you, Garfield.
[413:51.01]We all love you.
[413:51.37]I mean, we like this Garfield.
[414:18.86]Not the Garfield that actually is on TV and in video clips.
[414:24.44]I'm not a fan of that video clip Garfield.
[414:28.48]But I'm a fan of this Garfield.
[414:29.40]He's a good guy.
[414:31.91]Corbett.
[414:32.29]Thanks, Corbett, for the $1.
[414:33.49]Ah, yes, real music.
[414:35.67]Thank you.
[414:36.13]Erdemius.
[414:36.77]Thanks for the $1, Erdemius.
[414:37.95]Wicked Media says... Death Crypt is an American experimental hip-hop band from Sacramento.
[414:45.53]The group consists of vocalist M.C.
[414:47.57]Rye, drummer and producer Zach Hill, and recording engineer Andy Morin.
[414:50.41]Their sound, paired with the aggressive performances, draws on punk rock, electronic noise, and industrial styles.
[414:58.61]You'd personally recommend the albums Money Store, Ex-Military, and Year of the Snitch.
[415:03.49]Okay.
[415:06.03]Yeah.
[415:06.93]When I heard that name, I thought it was a death metal band.
[415:09.91]So.
[415:12.87]I'll give them a listen.
[415:13.65]It sounds interesting.
[415:18.21]But, thank you.
[415:18.81]Thank you, Snoozencopter, for the $30, Snoozen.
[415:22.11]Thank you.
[415:26.42]Much appreciated, man.
[415:29.68]And you say one last thing.
[415:30.88]I wanted to tell you this in an earlier stream already, but now that we can finally talk openly about Star, this makes the question easier.
[415:40.43]Do you...
[415:43.00]Do you think about you and Star writing bits together?
[415:45.66]I remember how you two often helped each other with ideas back in the YouTube days.
[415:52.73]Yeah, I think he's got a second part of the message.
[415:54.17]And now that you want to focus more on bits, I feel like you can come up with great jokes, especially Star's humor really shines writing scripted jokes and some improvised funny ideas.
[416:04.09]Long story short, you two come up with genius jokes.
[416:06.88]I want to see more of it.
[416:09.20]Also, my mom wanted to give you money to show her gratitude for the birthday message, so the two messages are sponsored by mom.
[416:14.96]Call her someday.
[416:18.76]Well, I'm not going to call your mom.
[416:21.68]But, thank you, Snoozycopter.
[416:24.62]And, yeah.
[416:26.02]I think... There's a lot of funny shit, right?
[416:31.73]And wherever that inspiration comes from, I'll take it a thousand times, right?
[416:39.23]I get random inspiration to think about a joke or a stream idea from a lot of places.
[416:45.80]Whether it's from a friend or an experience or something that I just want to do just because I feel like it.
[416:53.32]And I think with Star, we would essentially... That's what we did.
[416:58.84]Our YouTube channels were trying to come up with interesting ideas.
[417:04.10]That's all we wanted to do.
[417:06.76]So we were on the same page.
[417:08.84]Always.
[417:11.66]And... Not to really bring this up again, and really put a damper on everybody's day here... But... Streaming versus YouTube... Is a lot different.
[417:27.12]It's not really coming up with... Scripted jokes and bits and... I wanna edit a bunch of shit and it's a livestream of you playing a game.
[417:37.49]and I've said this a million times so far, I'd like to bridge that gap, right?
[417:43.47]And you've already seen the streams where I've been trying to do that already.
[417:47.71]I would like to bridge the gap between live content that doesn't necessarily just have to be hanging out in a game or walking around a city.
[417:59.12]I want to bring in that other aspect because that's where I have the most fun.
[418:04.09]But again, I don't want to put a damper on anybody.
[418:06.10]Like, oh, you and Star are going to make all kinds of edited YouTube funny jokes.
[418:10.70]We're in a different beast right now.
[418:12.30]It's a lot harder to do stuff like that on Twitch.
[418:15.88]It's way easier to be able to edit a video on YouTube.
[418:22.87]But... We've talked... I've brought it up to him.
[418:26.87]And he's been on board with some of the things that I've already talked about.
[418:31.66]And...
[418:34.24]I might just say fuck it and just kind of talk about this now.
[418:36.54]I mean, it's like one o'clock in the morning.
[418:38.40]How many people are even here?
[418:39.20]Because this, yeah, let's just do it.
[418:43.94]Fuck it.
[418:45.02]So this, what I'm going to talk about is a video, is a stream that I want to do.
[418:50.59]If you watch the podcast, you've already heard about it.
[418:53.83]It's something that I've been working on with one of my close producer buddies.
[418:58.97]He's been in the stream before.
[419:01.13]He did like that AMA after the Rumble.
[419:04.67]We've been desperately trying to put together... I'm going to tell you right now, if you don't want to know what I'm telling you right now, you're probably going to want to leave this ring.
[419:14.56]Have a good night.
[419:15.44]Take care.
[419:16.06]See you soon.
[419:18.66]But you're probably not going to want to hear all this.
[419:21.70]Because this is something that might... It's going to be hard to do now.
[419:29.05]Okay, I leave now.
[419:29.91]Alright, well, if you're going to leave, take care.
[419:33.75]Much love to you.
[419:37.59]okay so um back in december january february march around march of this year I wanted to get tried for killing santa in a real courthouse with actors and it's written we wrote the whole thing the whole thing is ready to go the only problem it was going to have an attorney we're going to be multiple attorneys they're going to be a judge witnesses and all that shit right
[420:06.60]You guys were going to be the jury.
[420:07.64]You were going to sit in the jury box.
[420:09.68]And you were going to, obviously, I would hope you would have a good enough brain to try me fairly.
[420:15.92]You were the jury.
[420:17.84]So how this was going to work out, and the reason why I bring this up after we talk about Star, is because I thought it was going to be a funny idea, potentially, if he was a surprise witness, right?
[420:29.09]A character witness that I didn't know existed.
[420:32.92]That was gonna be a potential way for us to come back and do things together, right?
[420:37.44]Like, oh, wait, hold on a minute.
[420:38.84]He's a witness?
[420:40.24]This guy?
[420:40.60]No, no, no, no, no.
[420:41.22]He can't be.
[420:42.02]I'm talking about this is before we even did the stream two days ago, right?
[420:47.46]So... But the problem is... It's not easy to put that shit together.
[420:56.95]It's very difficult.
[420:59.18]And it's gotten to a point where it's taken so long to get in touch with all these people.
[421:02.65]We've been moved around to different courts.
[421:05.09]We were going to be at this courthouse.
[421:06.69]This person sent us to this courthouse.
[421:08.65]And now we're like in touch with a college that has like a courtroom.
[421:11.93]It just falls apart over and over again because people don't give a fuck out here.
[421:18.78]We tried.
[421:19.58]Desperately.
[421:21.24]And it's still possible.
[421:22.64]It's still very possible that this could actually happen.
[421:27.04]And if it doesn't happen here, then we're going to try in Vegas.
[421:31.90]Because it's... Those of you that have been here before, it was a lot... There's a lot of reason to go to Vegas is for that.
[421:39.28]I hope we can get another courthouse to do it for us.
[421:45.48]Grain screen it?
[421:46.06]No, it has to be real.
[421:47.86]I will not grain screen it.
[421:48.98]It has to be real.
[421:50.48]We have to be in a real place.
[421:51.65]There has to be real people.
[421:56.42]I don't want to cut corners on any of these things.
[421:59.80]I have to be real.
[422:00.26]There has to be a wedding joke at some point.
[422:06.56]There already is.
[422:07.08]Don't worry.
[422:08.32]You want another?
[422:08.92]You want a Jerma Rumble Live 2 spoiler?
[422:11.29]I'll give it to you right now.
[422:12.11]It's the only thing I'll ever tell you.
[422:15.01]Would you like one?
[422:20.65]No.
[422:21.11]Do it.
[422:21.87]No.
[422:22.47]Okay.
[422:22.97]That's... I won't.
[422:25.82]This is, this is my favorite, this is my favorite bit.
[422:31.00]Hopefully you see it at some point.
[422:34.56]Nothing to do with Gloomhead.
[422:38.98]Three out of a thousand people.
[422:43.84]But that pulls us back to what we would, just pulls us full circle the whole thing.
[422:50.28]wanting more jokes and wanting more quote and I'm gonna use quotes because I mean I hate to use the word quotes but like funny streams or planned streams or not you know just like an IRL stream or a video game stream it's a lot harder to do that shit on Twitch than it is on YouTube which is why a lot of people kind of just gravitate away from it when they do Twitch but we shall see if I can bridge that gap
[423:24.91]Pre-recorded streams.
[423:25.89]No, not pre-recorded.
[423:27.91]Maybe some pre-recorded aspects, but... Everything that you've seen me do on this stream, with the exception of a couple of clips, small clips, that had to be there, have all been live.
[423:40.54]They have been pre-recorded.
[423:41.64]A lot of people thought that the stream two or three days ago was pre-recorded.
[423:44.36]It's not.
[423:44.66]A lot of people, me having dinner with the family was pre-recorded.
[423:49.16]That was live.
[423:50.44]That was not pre-recorded.
[423:59.80]For recording this meme.
[424:02.20]Yes, it was live.
[424:03.00]Of course it was.
[424:03.56]I mean, Santa is magic, so of course he is.
[424:12.36]How'd you do the money draw?
[424:13.58]Just had another camera.
[424:15.42]And had a hotkey to switch between them.
[424:20.84]You could get huge if you consistently do skit streams.
[424:25.87]Popularity doesn't concern me as much as actually being happy with what I'm doing.
[424:33.82]The audience that I have now is very, very fucking large.
[424:37.60]It is.
[424:39.84]And sure, could it be a lot larger?
[424:42.52]Oh, absolutely it could be, but this stream is a lot of people here.
[424:46.75]There were three, four thousand people concurrently here today.
[424:55.84]So I always want to try.
[424:59.24]I'm going to keep trying.
[425:00.58]We'll just put it that way.
[425:05.07]But that is kind of what I have to say about the whole doing more kind of comedy streams and edited stream or edited videos.
[425:13.65]A lot of people don't want to translate that kind of content to Twitch.
[425:20.54]And that's pretty much it.
[425:27.34]And I also- I want the stuff that you're watching to feel like it's really happening.
[425:33.44]You know what I mean?
[425:35.22]Even if you know it's bullshit, even if you know it's been made up or it's a joke, I want you to- I don't want you to feel like it's a- I would like you to think it's actually you watching it, you know what I mean?
[425:44.54]Not to get, like, existential about content here, but it's more fun when it's supposed to be real, right?
[425:53.31]It's more fun when it's... Oh, this is a live stream.
[425:56.70]This is really fucking happening right now.
[426:03.88]I don't ever want to do any overproduced fakey shit.
[426:07.88]I'd rather it be something that I think is funny or interesting that is kind of... that's really just happening.
[426:21.35]Fakey shit.
[426:27.83]Well, in the years that I have left of my young adult life, I'm going to try.
[426:35.14]We'll see how successful it is.
[426:36.96]But that's a very long-winded answer to what you said, Snoozen.
[426:43.56]But it's actually a very complicated answer.
[426:45.98]Because it's not as simple as I think a lot of people might think.
[426:51.85]But, young adult.
[426:53.63]I am a young adult.
[426:55.80]do you not I would say 35 is when you're not a young adult anymore I'm okay don't kid yourself up 35 is when you're a young not a young adult anymore I'm still a kid young boomer no don't I'm not a young boomer I'm a kid
[427:25.79]I'm basically 50.
[427:26.83]I'm closer to 50 than I am... Am I closer to 50 than I am 20?
[427:31.01]No.
[427:33.31]We're good.
[427:34.55]I'm still just a baby boy.
[427:37.86]But anyways, thank you, Snoozum.
[427:39.66]Thank you, Eves, for the $2.45.
[427:41.26]I'll be updating my Scotland trip to Streak regularly.
[427:44.00]Wait, what?
[427:44.86]What are your thoughts on... Wario?
[427:48.84]What is this?
[427:50.57]What is this?
[428:00.24]What is Zawarudo?
[428:08.40]What?
[428:08.58]I don't understand.
[428:15.84]Oh, it's from Georgia's Bizarre Adventure.
[428:17.57]Oh, okay.
[428:23.09]Oh, well, I don't know what to think about it because I've never seen that television series.
[428:29.61]I don't know what Zawarudo is.
[428:34.91]Zawaluigi.
[428:36.49]Thank you, Eaps, though.
[428:38.07]Thank you, BingleSprut, for the one dollar.
[428:39.89]BingleMySprut.
[428:43.27]No.
[428:44.55]Thank you, SixHellUnderHorse, for the ten bucks.
[428:51.06]I, for one, think it's a good thing.
[428:53.66]The... What is this?
[428:56.80]Why are you guys giving... What are these, like, random quotes?
[429:09.71]I have to, like, type this whole thing out to see what this is.
[429:19.19]I don't know.
[429:19.51]I don't know.
[429:19.91]I don't... Thank you for the $10, Six Hell Underhorse.
[429:25.31]I don't... I don't know.
[429:26.00]I don't like to say words.
[429:27.36]This is... I gotta be careful.
[429:29.84]I don't know what this is.
[429:38.72]Boomer Streamer doesn't understand youth culture.
[429:44.96]He's true.
[429:45.82]He's right.
[429:46.30]That's true.
[429:47.11]I don't.
[429:49.29]I don't know.
[429:49.77]I don't understand this youth culture.
[429:53.67]That's correct.
[429:56.43]But I'm still young, goddammit.
[429:59.56]Yeah, I can still... My lungs can be filled with so much air.
[430:07.28]I can sit here and I can lift this chair up like it's no problem at all.
[430:16.43]Stop.
[430:18.81]Is that what you want me to do?
[430:24.60]You want me to stop doing that?
[430:28.72]Okay, take it easy.
[430:29.94]I'm 50 years old.
[430:30.74]50 years old.
[430:35.21]Is this a bunch of shit memes?
[430:36.67]I'm not missing anything?
[430:40.47]You can't even lift the TV?
[430:41.55]I can lift the TV!
[430:43.85]Watch this!
[430:45.55]Ah!
[430:46.41]Got it.
[430:48.37]Hey!
[430:48.93]Oof!
[430:49.85]Mc... Oof!
[430:51.49]Thanks for the one dollar.
[430:53.59]Sometimes I like to suck on my... To... What?
[431:01.31]Alright, you like to put your feet in your mouth.
[431:05.22]Alright, that's fine.
[431:06.56]Thank you.
[431:06.88]Thank you, Dirty Margaret, for the $1.
[431:08.46]Great camera cut to that draw full of money in your lap.
[431:10.64]Jeremiah Big.
[431:15.92]Can I ban that guy?
[431:17.50]Am I allowed to ban that person?
[431:24.79]No.
[431:25.81]No, they didn't do anything wrong.
[431:31.34]Did they?
[431:34.70]Did they do anything wrong?
[431:40.68]You tell him.
[431:41.92]You tell me.
[431:51.65]No, Ben.
[431:54.27]He didn't do anything.
[431:56.07]Look, he didn't hurt anybody.
[432:00.22]He's just doing his thing.
[432:01.24]That's like saying, picking your nose.
[432:02.80]Like, should we ban people that put their finger in their nose and wipe their boogers on their desk?
[432:07.81]I mean, is that doing something wrong?
[432:10.39]No, but I can't be the judge, jury, and executioner there.
[432:25.85]He's projecting.
[432:28.49]Thank you, Oof, by the way.
[432:30.23]Thank you, Dirty Margaret, by the way, as well.
[432:31.93]Eefs, thanks for the $2.45.
[432:32.55]Eefs, gonna leave the stream on while I sleep.

[433:20.36]Oh, what a funny streamer.
[433:23.34]Oh, yeah.

[434:48.75]Can I?
[434:49.83]A semi-actual Monday.
[434:52.37]Thanks for the $5.
[434:53.07]Yo, Germa used paint cans as ice cream buckets.
[434:59.65]Thank you.
[435:04.01]Thank you.
[435:04.37]I was so nervous reading that one.
[435:07.05]I didn't know what you were going to say.
[435:09.78]Thank you.
[435:10.14]Mostly lost for the $1.
[435:11.18]How are you pronouncing orange?
[435:14.54]Orange?
[435:16.66]Orange.
[435:19.34]Earl of Illusion, thanks for the $1.
[435:20.66]Hey there, German.
[435:21.16]First time ever managing to catch you live after watching channel vids and archive streams since 2014.
[435:28.18]Here's my inaugural make-the-boy-talk text to let you know that you've brought me, my brother, and friends a combined decade of laughs at this point.
[435:37.12]And I can't thank you enough for it.
[435:39.21]I'll be working on a certain Jim Carrey movie soon, so I won't be able to catch live streams for a bit, but I'll be back soon.
[435:45.33]Enjoy the jail time for selling frozen paint to children.
[435:50.52]Thank you, Earl.
[435:52.64]Uh, Jim Carrey movie.
[435:56.08]That sounds pretty fucking cool.
[435:59.92]You'll have to let us know what it was.
[436:01.14]That's very intriguing.
[436:05.44]But thanks a lot, Earl.
[436:06.70]Much love.
[436:07.10]Seriously.
[436:09.47]Thanks a lot.
[436:13.03]ThatFalloutGuy, thanks for the $1.
[436:14.93]Hey, Jerma, first time giving bits to a streamer.
[436:16.61]Honestly, I love what you do.
[436:18.85]And keep at it, man.
[436:20.30]By the way, I know your pain with internet troubles.
[436:23.60]Oh, it sucks.
[436:25.34]FalloutGuy, it sucks.
[436:28.40]Thankfully, we've been able to dodge them for a long time.
[436:33.06]For a long time.
[436:35.31]And by long time, I'm talking like three weeks.
[436:37.77]Four weeks.
[436:38.93]That's an eternity.
[436:40.17]Wowd.
[436:41.79]My ears.
[436:42.19]What's going on?
[436:46.85]What happened?
[436:47.27]What are you doing?
[436:51.10]Oh, oh, oh.
[436:52.00]I hit the mic.
[436:52.72]I'm sorry.
[436:53.68]Whoops.
[436:55.86]Yeah, internet problems suck.
[436:57.54]Hopefully I never have to see them ever again.
[437:00.44]Chubby Kitten, thanks for the $1.
[437:01.68]Can I get three scoops of that hard purple?
[437:05.91]I want Burger King so bad.
[437:10.43]Thank you.
[437:11.51]He's dialing on the phone.
[437:12.27]It's time for the Garfengers initiative.
[437:13.25]And here is the comic book.
[437:37.63]He turns into a bird.
[437:41.39]Five bucks for a Garfagraph.
[437:42.63]What is this world coming to?
[437:44.01]If it does go into effect, hopefully it won't compromise the look of the comics.
[437:47.52]Right, Germo?
[437:49.96]That's alright.
[437:53.02]Thanks, though.
[437:56.38]Thank you.
[437:58.04]Thank you.
[437:58.38]Kill Ganon for the one dollar.
[437:59.44]Why don't you just play The Sims?
[438:00.69]At least you can kill people in that game.
[438:08.29]Because the Sims... I don't want to play The Sims.
[438:10.75]Everyone's done the same thing in The Sims.
[438:13.73]If I played The Sims... You're watching a guy do the same thing you've already seen a million times.
[438:19.57]Why am I doing this voice?
[438:21.33]Pull on.
[438:21.73]Pull it back.
[438:25.22]If I played The Sims, you would see me do the thing you've seen a thousand times.
[438:31.55]I'm going to piss my pants on the floor.
[438:34.27]That's really funny.
[438:35.57]It is.
[438:36.61]Lock somebody in a bathroom and they pee their pants and die.
[438:39.61]Okay, funny.
[438:40.37]And the gravestone pops up.
[438:41.82]Drop somebody in a pool.
[438:43.10]Take the ladder out.
[438:43.92]Okay, that's it.
[438:45.20]All right.
[438:48.94]Build a house and put like nine toilets in one room.
[438:52.02]That's funny, I guess.
[438:52.90]But you've seen it.
[438:54.80]He's done it before.
[438:56.55]He already did it.
[439:00.87]don't even need to know who I'm referring to.
[439:02.35]They already did it.
[439:09.62]But thank you, Kilgannon.
[439:13.74]Thank you to also Chubby Kitten for the $1.
[439:17.02]The radiator is going to melt the ice cream.
[439:19.52]It's okay.
[439:22.26]No, that's what the exhaust is for, to suck out all the hot air.
[439:26.27]Thank you, Silverflame, for the $1.
[439:27.64]I think you've forgotten that a family is going to move into this house.
[439:30.52]Instead of a kitchen, they will have an ice cream shop and be forced to eat paint.
[439:34.72]That's before we turned it into a mall and I refused to sell.
[439:41.42]Kaltari, thank you, Kaltari, for the $30.
[439:43.18]Thank you, Kaltari, for the large amount of money here.
[439:48.79]To be quite honest, I just wanted to upgrade my bit badge.
[439:52.01]Kappa JK.
[439:53.61]Though, seriously...
[439:55.53]Love you, Jeremy.
[439:56.37]Enjoy these farmed ad bits.
[439:58.25]That's a lot of farmed ad bits.
[440:01.95]Holy shit.
[440:02.53]How long did that take you to get $30 there?
[440:07.39]Farming ads and you got $30?
[440:08.87]Wow.
[440:13.09]That's... Thank you for giving them to me.
[440:15.39]That's... Sounds like a lot of pain.
[440:20.99]Have a great night, though.
[440:21.64]Thank you, Kaltari, for the $30.
[440:26.38]Uh, Lord Aravic, thanks for the $1.
[440:28.48]You've probably been asked this before, but would you ever consider adding better twitch.tv or frankerfacez emotes to your channel, like clap or monkaS?
[440:38.76]Also, I'm sorry you didn't get to go on the water slide.
[440:42.44]Um... That's like a B-T-T-V, right?
[440:51.95]Yeah...
[440:54.76]I don't know.
[440:55.30]I'm a fucking god damn.
[440:56.32]Like you guys have already made fun of me.
[440:57.54]I don't know about youth culture.
[440:58.63]I don't know how to set that up.
[441:05.27]Thanks.
[441:07.03]Maybe.
[441:07.37]I'll look into that actually.
[441:08.80]We'll see.
[441:10.62]God damn it.
[441:11.16]I did the thing.
[441:12.02]I said the thing.
[441:13.68]No.
[441:14.26]I said it.
[441:14.96]I'm sorry.
[441:16.26]Oh well.
[441:25.93]Everyone that's confused, I'll look into it.
[441:28.83]We talked about this like five streams ago.
[441:31.19]It's my bullshit index.
[441:34.11]That means I'm not going to look into it.
[441:35.61]That's what I say when I'm not going to look into something.
[441:47.24]You can add more custom emotes with BET TV.
[441:51.18]You literally just have to click add emote to channel.
[441:57.30]I'll look into it.
[442:00.36]He's not looking into it and make fun of his hair.

[444:39.67]It pisses me off.
[444:42.09]Just let me buy the whole game.
[444:43.01]Let me play the damn game.
[444:45.69]I don't want to wait.

[444:53.27]Baskin-Robbins in the front.

[445:00.84]Hey, thanks, Kilgan.
[445:02.44]Thank you, Fallout Guy, for the $1.
[445:04.50]It's a clip.
[445:05.20]What is it?
[445:13.59]I don't understand what this is.
[445:14.65]Yeah, I told you I wanted to eat bologna.
[445:16.59]Yeah, I like bologna.
[445:17.63]It's good.
[445:18.57]Sandwich bologna with some mustard, mayo, and some Swiss cheese.
[445:23.26]It's a great sandwich.
[445:25.10]I'm gonna be attacked for this?
[445:29.88]Thank you.
[445:30.19]Mostly lost for the $1.
[445:31.07]I had to step away from the computer so I didn't suffocate during the poster bit.
[445:34.51]Holy shit.
[445:39.21]Uh, CAD?
[445:40.39]Oh, you didn't even hear it.
[445:41.37]Sorry.
[445:42.69]My mic was muted.
[445:44.69]Sorry.
[445:45.89]This is what it was.
[445:47.11]I need to have bologna put in my mouth.
[445:49.23]That's it.
[445:51.27]And it doesn't matter what it is.
[445:53.73]That's why I'm being yelled at.
[445:56.17]Bologna is the worst lunch meat.
[445:59.45]No, it isn't.
[446:00.89]Ham is.
[446:01.45]Ham's terrible.
[446:04.51]I will debate you on ham being the worst deli meat for one particular reason.
[446:10.73]Okay, fine.
[446:11.39]No, no, no.
[446:11.76]Let's do this.
[446:12.18]Let's do it right now.
[446:12.98]I'll do it right now and we can talk about it right now.
[446:15.54]Please give me a deli ham.
[446:17.54]I would love to take it.
[446:18.62]I'll take it out.
[446:19.42]What's that?
[446:19.86]Okay, what's that?
[446:21.22]Peel off the sludge sound.
[446:25.62]Oh, yeah.
[446:26.08]I love having when I have deli meat and it's dripping with water.
[446:29.17]Let me put that on my sandwich.
[446:31.05]The water from the watery gross deli meat ham gets into the bread and when you bite it, it's disgusting.
[446:37.45]It's covered in this film of watery slime.
[446:42.57]Get it out of here.
[446:46.04]And plus, ham's gross anyways, especially the deli ham.
[446:48.96]If you want a watery, slimy deli meat, at least have one that tastes good and have it be turkey.
[446:56.37]Bologna is dry.
[446:59.45]It's flabascious.
[447:03.09]Is that a word?
[447:14.78]It's rubbery.
[447:15.68]It bounces around.
[447:16.36]That's what I meant.
[447:19.65]You like all deli meats equally.
[447:23.63]Well, it's not as flabascus as flabascus.
[447:33.52]Meat bounces?
[447:35.10]Turkey is gross?
[447:37.88]Don't make me angry.
[447:39.46]Turkey is not gross.
[447:41.84]Look, all turkey deli turkey.
[447:46.27]Lobasco sauce.
[447:50.06]Turkey pad.
[447:50.72]Turkey pad.
[447:52.14]I will ban that guy.
[447:53.68]I don't remember his name.
[447:56.52]Thank God he was able to run into the crowd and I didn't get to see his full name.
[448:01.46]That guy just screamed something really mean to me in the middle of a convention and sprinted into the crowd.
[448:08.01]Where the fuck did he go?
[448:12.91]Chicken is better.
[448:13.93]I like all poultry.
[448:17.39]What's with the bologna hate?
[448:18.95]I don't understand.
[448:19.65]You think you're above bologna?
[448:21.65]It tastes great.
[448:22.53]It's cheap.
[448:24.23]It's easy to put in anything.
[448:25.66]Any sandwich.
[448:26.56]What's wrong with it?
[448:30.20]Poultry is for cowards.
[448:32.74]Huh?
[448:39.27]He's gone already.
[448:40.01]I don't know where he went.
[448:45.12]Chicken is stringy.
[448:46.14]Well, maybe if you cook it in a way that makes it... You can make anything stringy.
[448:51.58]What are my thoughts on hot dogs?
[448:55.08]Hot dogs are just bologna tubes.
[448:56.84]I love them.
[448:58.58]You ever bit into a cold hot dog?
[449:00.44]It is bologna.
[449:03.77]You could put a hot dog in between two pieces of bread, put mayonnaise and mustard and cheese on it, and you'd be eating a bologna sandwich.
[449:19.97]It's just sliced up hot dog, thin.
[449:22.35]Doesn't that sound great?
[449:24.55]Think of a hot dog that's been squished and pressed and rolled out with a rolling pin.
[449:28.64]Flat.
[449:34.38]Don't eat raw hot dogs.
[449:38.06]I don't do it anymore.
[449:40.28]Sometimes I just didn't give a shit when I was younger and I was so bored and lazy.
[449:44.44]I couldn't be bothered.
[449:45.30]So we had a package of hot dogs.
[449:47.50]And I would just open up the package, take out a hot dog, and just eat it like it was a piece of string cheese.
[449:52.40]This isn't a bit.
[449:58.73]No, this is not a bit.
[449:59.39]Bologna is great.
[450:00.03]Hot dogs are great.
[450:00.71]What do those youth kids say?
[450:07.18]Don't even think about putting the at symbol in front of me.
[450:10.72]Idiot.
[450:11.78]Right?
[450:12.34]Did I do it right?
[450:13.04]Did I get it?
[450:13.62]Good.
[450:22.82]You probably have bad parasites.
[450:25.90]No, I... No, no, no.
[450:26.80]I don't have any parasites.
[450:27.75]I eat garlic.
[450:29.93]I eat a shitload of garlic.
[450:32.81]Garlic kills parasites, guys.
[450:35.05]Eat more garlic.
[450:43.22]What does that even mean?
[450:44.42]Look up your... That's nutritional data.
[450:48.79]Garlic kills all those bastards.
[450:55.73]Bologna is just spam and plastic packaging that you can fold and eat a little thing.
[451:00.19]That's fine.
[451:02.37]Have some raw bologna, eat some garlic, and then shit out the dead bugs.
[451:06.45]What's the problem?
[451:07.09]I don't understand.
[451:12.42]Hey, CadTV, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[451:14.90]I've never seen them all with so much art of Willem Dafoe.
[451:20.18]He's a great actor.
[451:22.05]Probably my favorite actor.
[451:28.53]Thank you, Cad.
[451:30.01]Falloutguy, thanks again for the $1.
[451:31.25]Please get a real giant poster and put it in your room.
[451:36.97]I hate posters.
[451:40.66]Mediocre Pawnage, thanks for the $1.
[451:45.02]Paul Blart or Build-A-Bear?
[451:49.56]Build-A-Bear Workshop.
[451:53.24]If I could build my own mall in that game, I would have done it.
[451:56.04]And yes, you just heard me go, because I put my finger down and hit my lip when I was talking.
[452:00.20]That wasn't your audio equipment.
[452:01.96]Your sound is working normally as intended.
[452:03.74]That was me.
[452:04.72]I did that.
[452:08.24]Hey, Asian Turtle, thanks for the $1.
[452:11.79]Hey Jerma, I bought House Flipper after you first streamed it, and I recently bought and sold the house that you're currently working on.
[452:17.15]I didn't turn mine into a mall, instead I made it an art thief's house with millions in artwork.
[452:22.12]Thought you might want to see it.
[452:24.20]Also, any plans for more horror games?
[452:26.54]Yeah, if any good ones come out.
[452:30.97]Uh, well, this shit is way cooler than my house.
[452:34.35]Well, I'm not going to say that, because that would show bias.
[452:37.57]But, hey, good work.
[452:41.16]This actually looks really good.
[452:46.18]No bullshit.
[452:46.92]This looks great.
[452:54.53]I don't see a Best Buy in here, so I'm sorry.
[452:58.41]Where do I get my stereo?
[452:59.81]Where do I get my computer?
[453:03.89]Thank you, Asian Turtle.
[453:04.59]I'm glad you're enjoying the game.
[453:05.73]It's fun.
[453:08.63]Killcode, again, thanks for the $50 earlier.
[453:10.37]About the cat, we put the cat on the wall.
[453:12.91]Thank you so much.
[453:15.85]Thanks for the huge amount of money, dude.
[453:16.99]Seriously.
[453:18.99]Joe Jester, thanks for the $5.02.
[453:21.43]No message, but thank you, Joe.
[453:24.32]Pin, thanks for the $1.
[453:25.38]So I spent the last couple weeks back home in Alabama.
[453:28.64]And as it turns out, you are... This is crazy bills.
[453:36.80]Fireworks.
[453:40.99]Of course there is.
[453:48.08]Crazy Bills.
[453:49.56]Bill Crazy's Firestand.
[453:56.98]Thank you, Pin.
[453:58.56]Thank you for the Bill Crazy lore.
[454:03.56]Jazz Jelly, thanks for the $1.
[454:04.93]Notice me, Jeremy.
[454:06.97]Sure.
[454:08.31]How you doing?
[454:09.21]Hi, Jazz.
[454:10.85]Fallout guy thanks for the one dollar.
[454:12.16]Well, that's D-U-M-G.
[454:14.14]Dumb.
[454:15.90]From me.
[454:16.64]I said that.
[454:17.72]That's dumb.
[454:20.38]Say it.
[454:21.38]Say dumb I love.
[454:22.78]Dumb.
[454:23.94]Dumb.
[454:26.04]Sounds pretty similar to the other one, doesn't it?
[454:28.89]Dumb.
[454:38.48]I'm getting too tired for this shit.
[454:41.13]I can't.
[454:41.69]Thank you Danger Dad for the one dollar.
[454:44.59]Hey man, I've been watching you since 2011.
[454:46.65]Stay great.
[454:48.29]I thought he called me a schmuck.
[454:51.15]He's a shamrock.
[454:53.01]Hey man, it's been great.
[454:53.93]Thanks.
[454:54.25]See you later, you schmuck.
[454:58.95]My old grandfather.
[455:02.84]Not my grandfather, my uncle.
[455:06.46]If you don't know, here's your lore.
[455:09.44]Half of my family is Jewish.
[455:12.24]And the other half is Irish.
[455:14.06]Catholic.
[455:15.26]So, I've heard that word a bunch of times.
[455:19.04]This is your lore.
[455:19.58]This is your, like, my lore.
[455:26.71]I see S-H and I go, oh, he's a dog.
[455:32.07]And ironically, me too.
[455:39.53]Add it to the wiki.
[455:44.15]I don't touch the wiki.
[455:45.03]I don't update the wiki.
[455:46.01]Why do you guys think I go to the wiki and update it?
[455:49.35]Why would I update my own wiki?
[455:52.11]There's so much megalomania behind that.
[455:55.13]Oh, I just said that half my family is Jewish and half my family is Irish.
[455:59.98]Let me go update that on the wiki.
[456:01.54]Let me just go update my page on the wiki.
[456:06.80]I don't update my wiki.
[456:13.77]The Irish are known for being Catholic.
[456:16.33]I mean, they are.
[456:17.93]I'm not going to read the wiki on stream.
[456:21.43]I've been streaming for like eight hours.
[456:22.65]We've got to go to bed.
[456:29.96]But thank you to Danger Dad for that.
[456:34.58]One dollar.
[456:35.04]Ratuna, thanks for the one dollar.
[456:36.32]This all started because you wanted to put the kitchen upstairs.
[456:41.30]Yeah, it did.
[456:41.70]You're right.
[456:42.30]It's true.
[456:45.44]That is true.
[456:45.98]Yeah, that's probably accurate.
[456:48.82]But thank you, Rudy, for the $5.
[456:49.66]Appreciate it.
[456:50.22]No, but I can't smash walls down with a hammer in Maul Tycoon.
[456:57.59]It's just buildings from afar.
[457:13.06]But thank you, Mostly Lost.
[457:13.86]Thank you, Jazz Jelly, for the $1.
[457:14.78]When are you going to play... Bofa?
[457:19.40]Bank of America?
[457:21.04]B-O-F... What is this?
[457:25.88]When I type in Bofa, I see it's Bank of America.
[457:28.83]Bank of America.
[457:30.97]Bank of America.
[457:41.99]What did I do?
[457:48.69]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[457:54.14]Well, you did it.
[457:55.16]Get that.
[458:15.60]A lot of penile memes floating around now.
[458:17.82]A lot of, like, crotchal and penile memes.
[458:19.48]I'm not sure I agree.
[458:20.22]I don't think I like it.
[458:28.03]It only took seven and a half hours.
[458:29.37]But I was resilient.
[458:37.43]ThatFalloutGuy, thank you for the $1.
[458:39.19]You fucked up saying my username.
[458:41.29]Refund right now.
[458:43.67]I'm sorry.
[458:44.57]Let me just do the refund button.
[458:46.25]By the way, the refund is five times refund.
[458:48.91]So the $1 here, you get $5 back.
[458:53.09]Got it?
[458:53.55]Okay.
[458:54.25]And resend.

[461:50.53]Yes, I can.
[461:54.56]Go to bed, Edward.
[462:01.07]He tried to get me to say that L word!
[462:03.05]I'm not gonna say it!
[462:06.47]I get to retaliate!
[462:07.49]Uh, thank you The Reaper of Memes for the $1.
[462:14.82]Play the 2004 SpongeBob SquarePants movie video game.
[462:20.02]Oddly specific, but... I still have a lot of PlayStation 2 stuff to do.
[462:25.06]Goddamn.
[462:25.68]Gonna have to wait till after Vegas for that stuff probably, seriously.
[462:32.77]I'll buy it.
[462:33.41]Why not?
[462:36.47]Maybe I'll play it.
[462:36.95]Maybe I'll do a Spongebob game night where we play every single chronologically in order Spongebob video game.
[462:45.25]That's too meme-y for me.
[462:46.29]I don't think I want to do that.
[462:47.01]Never mind.
[462:48.13]Pretend I never said that.
[462:54.71]Also, I mean every single one.
[462:57.25]It doesn't matter what platform they came out on.
[463:02.49]Uh, thank you, Reaper.
[463:03.17]Thank you, Southern M, for so- smu- no, smotherm, smother, smotherum.

[463:15.12]Thanks for the ten dollars.
[463:17.76]All dogs go to heaven, Jerma, and don't you forget, then they come back to life as angels that talk to kids.
[463:25.26]Seems good.
[463:30.21]I love dogs.
[463:33.16]I am the memiest person ever.
[463:35.34]No, I'm not.
[463:38.68]When have I ever said an internet meme on this channel?
[463:42.88]I don't spout out memes.
[463:48.91]I don't just, I don't, this is not like a meme channel.
[463:53.15]I am the meme.
[463:55.81]Does that mean that I'm hold on a minute?
[463:57.83]Does that mean that I do memes or does that mean that I do me?
[464:03.35]Take away one of the me's there get rid of the second me 32 year old boomer get rid of the me
[464:25.78]You've dabbed on stream.
[464:26.82]No, I haven't.
[464:27.18]I've wiped my nose on stream.
[464:29.26]And then somebody captured it and doctored it to make it look terrible.
[464:42.93]Fake.
[464:44.31]Thank you, Smotherum, for the ten bucks.
[464:45.91]Thank you, Rudy, for the one dollar.
[464:46.87]Are you ever going to stream TF2 again?
[464:48.09]Any possibilities that Star will ever either?
[464:50.49]I can't speak for him, but no.
[464:52.43]Actually, you know, I am going to speak for him.
[464:53.67]No.
[464:56.38]No.
[464:58.82]I don't know.
[464:59.16]For me?
[465:00.18]I do know for him.
[465:00.92]No.
[465:04.56]Oof.
[465:12.70]I streamed TF2 a couple months ago.
[465:18.72]But don't ever expect me to play any video game, but don't ever think I will never play one.
[465:24.41]Hopefully I've proved that as we've gone through here over the last few years.
[465:29.96]You just said a meme.
[465:32.12]How?
[465:35.06]What did I say?
[465:40.72]I said oof.
[465:43.30]No, but I'm reading that as if it's... That's a word.
[465:46.12]Alright, hold on a minute here.
[465:49.47]What is that?
[465:50.09]What word is that?
[465:50.69]Is that a meme?
[465:51.47]Did I just write a meme in the chat or did I make a sound of something that was happening?
[465:56.99]Is that a meme?
[466:01.01]Did I just write a meme in chat right there?
[466:02.73]Tell me.
[466:08.19]That's the sound that comes out of somebody's mouth when they get punched in the stomach.
[466:23.41]Minecraft sound.
[466:27.00]You're not allowed.
[466:27.56]There's no words anymore.
[466:29.28]Only memes.
[466:31.34]Okay, let's play a game.
[466:32.56]I'm going to write a random word in this chat.
[466:36.74]And you tell me if there is an associated meme with the word that I write.
[466:40.98]I'm going to write a random word.
[466:42.22]Turtle.
[466:50.03]Turtle.
[466:51.96]There is?
[466:52.92]Yeah.
[466:53.28]Oh, I like turtles.
[466:54.18]Yeah, okay.
[466:54.78]Fine.
[466:55.22]Let's do another one.
[466:56.38]So, but if you say the word turtle, you're maiming somebody here.
[466:59.75]How about, um... How about, um... I got one.
[467:14.94]Was that... Am I allowed to ever say that word?
[467:17.14]Oh, yeah.
[467:18.93]Cake is a lie.
[467:19.57]I can't remember if I should write the word cake ever again.
[467:21.43]There's no words anymore.
[467:22.37]Our language is broken down into micro-jokes.
[467:26.05]Uh, how about this one?
[467:27.57]Try to find me one.
[467:28.27]Try to find one with this.
[467:32.99]Utility.
[467:34.91]Yes.
[467:35.57]And what is that?
[467:36.23]What is it?
[467:52.25]Batman's utility belt is a meme.
[467:56.05]That's true.
[467:56.77]People make about utility belt jokes all the time.
[468:00.45]That's correct.
[468:01.03]Let's try one more.
[468:14.74]Trifecta.
[468:27.53]That's a meme.
[468:29.16]That's a joke.
[468:29.64]Somebody already made it.
[468:33.56]How about one more?
[468:40.10]No, never mind.
[468:40.85]I was going to write something fucking terrible.
[468:45.57]I can't do that.
[468:46.85]I was going to write something awful.
[468:51.84]Not a meme, but an actual awful thing.
[469:02.01]Someone tell me how to give bits.
[469:03.15]I'll tell you.
[469:03.63]It's so easy, man.
[469:05.33]Look down below your screen.
[469:06.49]You're going to see a give bits thing.
[469:08.83]It's going to be purple with white text on it.
[469:10.97]Click on that.
[469:11.83]Another pop-up's going to open for you.
[469:13.83]It's going to have you to be able to link your PayPal.
[469:16.29]You link your credit card.
[469:17.81]And I would recommend to start off, you save a little bit of money.
[469:20.21]I would buy the $500 package.
[469:22.51]I mean, there's other streamers on this platform that maybe, like, there's other streamers out there.
[469:26.16]But, like, you know, thank you.
[469:27.68]I mean, there's other streamers you can give that to.
[469:29.40]But, you know, there's me as well.
[469:37.20]Hey, thanks.
[469:39.10]Thank you to Valken for the one dollar.
[469:42.81]Hey Germ, I've been watching you since middle school and this is the same one... No, it's not.
[469:46.59]There's two middle school.
[469:48.31]Two middle schools.
[469:50.89]Back to back here.
[469:55.08]Wait, what?
[469:58.20]Hold on.
[469:58.74]Why is my brain locked out right now?
[470:01.00]Was there a second one of these?
[470:03.60]Did we stop in the middle of this?
[470:05.93]Of Valken's bits?
[470:13.10]Yeah, no, no, no, there's another one.
[470:16.12]Milkshake, right.
[470:18.75]Okay.
[470:20.69]We skipped a couple here too, so hold on a second there.
[470:23.43]Hold on, Falcon, sorry, I skipped a person here.
[470:28.37]Thank you, Foxin, Foxin, for the four dollars.
[470:32.19]Say this, say that word, I just bought you a fucking burger.
[470:37.83]I can't, I can't, that's me giving in.
[470:42.98]Thank you.
[470:45.37]But I appreciate the $4, dude.
[470:46.51]Thanks so much.
[470:47.87]But Valkin here.
[470:48.55]Valkin, thanks for the $1.
[470:49.49]Hey, Jim, I've been watching you since middle school.
[470:51.75]Your streams and videos have really helped to get me through some difficult bouts of anxiety these past couple of years.
[470:57.00]And you always manage to make me laugh.
[470:58.50]Thanks for being such a great streamer and entertainer.
[471:02.35]Thank you so much, Valkin.
[471:05.68]I'm shaking my hand because I just bumped my finger on my desk.
[471:07.64]But thank you.
[471:11.90]Thanks for being part of the channel for the last few years.
[471:14.44]Thanks for watching the videos.
[471:16.05]I'm happy that you can get some enjoyment from them.
[471:18.71]For real.
[471:20.53]Take care and thank you so much.
[471:23.13]Getting to the end here.
[471:23.77]Thank you most of the loss for the $1.
[471:25.21]Completely agree with you about that stupid prank meme.
[471:28.99]But what's this I hear about...
[471:32.37]dosing yourself with vinegar to keep the bugs away.
[471:38.65]I don't know, man.
[471:39.13]I've never heard of that technique.
[471:40.15]I don't think that works on mosquitoes.
[471:43.00]Thank you, Abortion Shark, for the $1.
[471:46.82]That is supposed to stand for lick my.
[471:51.66]Just like spelling eye cup.
[472:00.87]I said two words.
[472:01.63]No, I didn't say the actual one.
[472:04.27]I... We just did this.
[472:06.11]I said words.
[472:07.85]I didn't say a meme or a joke.
[472:09.57]I said two words.
[472:15.31]Thank you, AbortionShark, for the clarification.
[472:18.60]Hey, Ape808, thanks for the $1.
[472:20.72]I found these bits and I thought you should have them.
[472:22.20]Thank you.
[472:22.92]I will definitely take them.
[472:25.80]Appreciate it, Ape.
[472:26.40]Thanks for the $1.
[472:28.58]Johnny Nathaniel.
[472:30.24]Thank you for the $1.
[472:31.20]You're the reason I started streaming.
[472:33.22]I had subbed to you on YouTube in 2015, but never thought about watching you live.
[472:37.29]You are literally the funniest streamer.
[472:39.33]I love you very much.
[472:44.29]It's very, very... It's very humbling to know that you started streaming because of me.
[472:50.84]Good luck to you.
[472:51.48]Thank you.
[472:54.90]I really appreciate that.
[472:55.76]Thanks so much, man.
[472:56.74]And good luck.
[472:59.12]It's a dog-eat-dog world out here, but take care.
[473:04.24]Thank you so much.
[473:06.28]Asian Turtle, thanks for the dollar four.
[473:07.85]Hey, have you ever thought about doing an IRL planet stream where you wear a green balaclava in front of a green screen while spinning around your room?
[473:15.27]Maybe you could invite some friends to orbit around as well.
[473:19.29]No, never thought of it, but now I have.
[473:23.29]Thank you.
[473:25.41]Thank you, Yukateri.
[473:28.18]Thank you, Yakutare.
[473:28.84]That's so wrong.
[473:30.04]That's not even... That was insulting how wrong I said your name.
[473:33.18]Yakutare, right?
[473:35.98]Thank you for the $5.
[473:38.35]Don't get to watch many streams.
[473:41.09]But thanks for all the great content you create.
[473:42.87]And Mackerel, plus the other editors, help out putting on the second channel.
[473:47.90]Thank you so much.
[473:51.67]Appreciate the $5, and they appreciate the kind words, too.
[473:54.41]Very talented individuals.
[473:57.39]Thank you for trying again.
[473:58.27]You did better.
[474:00.57]That's all I... All I can do is try.
[474:04.23]And probably still do it terribly, but thank you.
[474:08.89]Appreciate the $5.
[474:10.99]Honey Chain, thanks for the $1.
[474:12.05]Have a good night, Jeremiah.
[474:12.79]You, too.
[474:13.25]Thank you, Honey.
[474:14.79]Honey Chain.
[474:16.99]Right.
[474:18.45]Thank you, Raph Mouse.
[474:20.22]For the $1, I fucking love all your scripted stuff.
[474:23.86]I think it's absolutely grade A content.
[474:26.90]But you're not going to abandon just hanging out sometimes, are you?
[474:30.02]Because I love just chilling out watching you play games.
[474:32.13]No.
[474:33.55]Because that would be impossible.
[474:36.43]It takes too much time to put something like that together.
[474:40.99]Right?
[474:41.17]I'm not just going to stream once a month.
[474:44.80]Right?
[474:47.06]That's... I don't want to do that.
[474:52.22]If there's a piece of scripted, kind of more live content-y content once every month or two, of course I'm going to still hang out and talk and do little podcasts and play games and do whatever, anything.
[475:08.93]It doesn't matter what it is.
[475:11.99]But this kind of stream will not go away.
[475:16.90]Other streams will be just replaced by the ones that I want to do.
[475:23.21]Have I ever tasted Captain Crunch?
[475:25.37]Yes.
[475:25.91]And it sure is delicious.
[475:27.79]Epic.
[475:28.11]Big.
[475:29.23]It's wonderful.
[475:30.13]I love Captain Crunch.
[475:32.73]Bro, luck.
[475:33.13]Thanks for the $1.
[475:33.87]Jeremy, you make me scared to turn 30.
[475:35.22]I don't want to grow old.
[475:36.92]Thank you.
[475:37.30]You're not old.
[475:39.56]By the time you and I are going to be in our hundreds, our brain matter is going to be on the blockchain, so it's going to be fine.
[475:47.60]We'll be decentralized old people.
[475:49.31]Don't worry.
[475:51.83]Hey, Lord Arabic, thanks for the $1.
[475:53.93]Also, forgot to mention before that the emotes that don't win the contest can be uploaded to FFZ to be used as channel-exclusive emotes if you want it.
[476:01.15]Just a suggestion, though.
[476:07.84]Just because there are a lot of great emotes, right?
[476:13.50]We'll see what happens with the other potential top 10, top 15.
[476:21.53]I don't know there's a new development here that might this could be something interesting I don't know you'll have to we'll figure it out on friday how does that sound oh not friday the poll closes on friday well you'll just yeah you'll see thank you though uh thank you lemonade for the one dollar when you started out on youtube or streaming did you get stage fright
[476:51.94]want to start but I've always have doubts people won't enjoy my content and also that my the bubble has popped or is about to pop with youtube's ad apocalypse and the plethora of gaming youtubers it seems really tough to start out there right now uh well I'll answer all these things um stage fright no I think that is sometimes turning them a microphone on and trying to figure out what the hell you're going to say next can be very difficult
[477:23.11]Because remember, streaming or YouTube, the mic is just hot.
[477:28.18]It's live.
[477:28.90]It's a hot mic.
[477:30.40]And, I mean, you've got to have something that you want to say, right?
[477:34.36]Especially if you're doing a YouTube video, because streaming is a little more lax on that.
[477:39.98]If you're doing an 8, 6, 7, 8-hour stream, people don't necessarily expect you to just be blurting out every... I mean, do I do that?
[477:51.43]I mean, I got a hot mic here.
[477:53.15]How often do I talk?
[478:00.65]I never stop.
[478:02.41]All the time.
[478:02.87]95%, 97% of the time.
[478:03.49]You don't stop.
[478:03.85]You never shut up.
[478:19.39]Well, alright, so anyways, let's take this as a... I guess the advice that I can give... Is... Stage fright wise... Just say whatever you want.
[478:34.76]Do whatever you want.
[478:35.32]Pretend like you're talking to people that you know.
[478:39.66]And the whole thing about the bubble popping, I would agree with you.
[478:41.94]Absolutely.
[478:43.65]I think the bubble, I think the YouTuber online influencer bubble, I think, exploded and burst probably two or three years ago.
[478:55.79]But that doesn't mean that you can't find something to do and find someone to watch.
[479:03.91]As long as you go into it with you knowing that you want to try and that you want to do it, that's all you can do.
[479:20.04]bitcoin isn't the bubble it's the needle eight hours oh this is a long stream we're almost done don't worry but yeah don't pretend to be somebody that you aren't because there's somebody that's tried that a handful of times it don't work you'll get sick of doing it uh
[479:41.88]Especially in the early stages.
[479:43.38]You feel like you have to be somebody that you know.
[479:44.94]Don't do it.
[479:46.51]Only be the person that you know.
[479:47.45]The easiest person to be.
[479:48.25]Because as... Honesty is the best policy.
[479:53.85]Treat others the way you want to be treated.
[479:55.15]This is like a third grade class right now.
[479:57.15]But you understand.
[479:58.35]What the fuck was that?
[479:59.27]There's like an animal in my desk.
[480:06.91]No, we're good.
[480:09.35]How authentic were my old videos?
[480:11.01]No, no, no.
[480:11.45]Those videos were authentic.
[480:14.19]It's just, it's almost like you wanted to put out a persona that was what you think people are expecting that you should be talking like and sounding like and acting like.
[480:24.30]Guys, I didn't swear in my first hundred videos.
[480:29.48]At least my first 50 to 60 videos, I did not say swear words.
[480:37.01]I didn't, I was so concerned about that, I didn't know, I thought it was... People were gonna hate that, people were gonna like that, people were gonna think I was... An asshole or something.
[480:51.08]Now you can go back and watch, during my Super Meat Boy playthrough, when I played through the whole game... I do these things, I'm like, oh shh, mmm, almost, oh, dang it!
[481:05.56]eventually it gets tiring it does trying to pretend that you're not going to do something gets tiring so that doesn't mean that my old videos my first 30 40 videos out of a thousand were not authentic no I just was trying to do something I was trying to act a way that I thought I had to act don't do that be you that's it I wish you the best of luck limited for real
[481:33.16]Just have fun.
[481:34.22]And don't go into it for any of the under... Don't go into it for any other reason.
[481:37.82]Besides, you want to enjoy what you're doing.
[481:39.08]That's it.
[481:40.82]Hey, Sir Feline.
[481:41.72]Thanks for the one dollar.
[481:43.18]Derm a long time fan here.
[481:45.38]It's been like four or five years since I got involved in your craziness.
[481:49.32]That's almost as long as you've been stuck in Anor Londo.
[481:56.37]Thanks, dude.
[481:57.25]Thank you.
[481:57.65]Appreciate that.
[481:59.27]$1, dude.
[481:59.95]Appreciate that.
[482:00.59]Thank you.
[482:01.13]Eternally Gaming.
[482:01.91]Thanks for the $1.
[482:03.25]I'm the guy who offered tech help a while back.
[482:05.17]Feel free to ask me for help, old man.
[482:10.81]Sometimes I... Not just one individual person, but sometimes I'll just jump in the Discord, into the general chat, and be like, does anybody know what I do, how to do RAM timing?
[482:21.79]What's a good place I got a patch for?
[482:23.33]I do that all the time.
[482:25.33]So...
[482:27.32]Thank you.
[482:27.58]I appreciate the help, though.
[482:28.64]Anybody that gives it to me.
[482:32.28]Thank you to Limited for your $1.25.
[482:35.84]I don't care too much about the money slash ad revenue aspect.
[482:41.65]Also, this is the first stream I've caught of yours live.
[482:44.19]Generally don't like house flipper gameplay videos because they're typically all pretty similar, but the way you play games is always fun and fresh.
[482:52.65]Then, Limited, you're already on the right track.
[482:57.48]don't go into youtube or twitch thinking you're going to try to make money don't go looking for sponsors don't go looking for paychecks don't do that start off that way and do what you want to do and try to at least inject something that you may not have seen before or a way that other people might not be doing things especially now it's there's a lot of people doing it
[483:23.58]Don't treat it as a get-rich-quick stream.
[483:25.73]Treat it as a thing that's fun for you to do in your spare time that you can develop some skills.
[483:32.35]Either creatively or even just talking.
[483:35.79]You'd be surprised at just developing speaking skills.
[483:41.51]Talking on a live stream for six, seven, five, whatever plus hours a day, two, three, four times a week, it improves how you talk to people in real life.
[483:51.50]You'll notice that it's easier for you to carry a conversation.
[483:58.84]Someone put Grandpa to bed.
[484:00.74]No, I refuse.
[484:01.76]I'm not going to bed until I'm tired.
[484:09.28]Thank you, bro.
[484:09.74]Look for the $4.
[484:10.46]Hey, Jeremy, I missed a lot of your streams, mate.
[484:12.82]Sorry for this.
[484:13.38]They recently got me driving a courtesy bus at work.
[484:16.92]I can't believe they're paying me to just drive around.
[484:18.84]PogChamp.
[484:20.36]Here's your pre-arranged cut.
[484:22.41]Thanks.
[484:24.53]Thank you for your luck.
[484:27.09]Driving a courtesy bus.
[484:28.31]What's a courtesy bus?
[484:31.49]Is it like you drive just a bunch of people around?
[484:35.25]Courtesy bus.
[484:42.24]Grandpa's throat really cleared.
[484:43.58]What do you mean, my throat?
[484:48.24]A really kind bus.
[484:49.64]It's a really nice bus.
[484:51.42]It's like a shuttle.
[484:52.28]Oh, okay.
[484:52.80]I see.
[484:52.94]Well, that's cool, bro.
[484:54.37]Look, thank you for the $4.
[484:55.93]Don't worry about missing streams.
[484:58.23]If you can make it, you can.
[484:59.09]And if you can't, that's fine.
[485:01.03]Glad you're here.
[485:04.51]Thank you, Sir Feline, for the $1.
[485:05.91]Does this mean that all Jerma content is technically non-canon?
[485:08.72]No.
[485:10.74]Everything is canon.
[485:13.82]All of it.
[485:14.84]Hey, Cheeky.
[485:15.50]Thanks, CheekyKY, for the five bucks.
[485:18.26]What is the... He's asking about that meme word.
[485:22.30]It's the one that starts with an S. I don't know.
[485:25.58]I know what it is, but we all know what it is.
[485:27.16]I think you know what it is, too.
[485:28.12]But thank you for the five dollars, Cheeky.
[485:29.40]Appreciate it.
[485:33.26]Hey, thanks.
[485:35.18]Thank you, E-Word, TwertyWordTwert, for the ten bucks.
[485:37.93]Sorry for giving you money.
[485:42.09]Thanks for the ten dollars, E-Word...
[485:45.42]Don't be sorry.
[485:48.15]I'll gladly take it.
[485:50.67]Ten bucks, though.
[485:51.27]That's a lot.
[485:51.61]Thanks a lot, man.
[485:53.55]Apple Cooler, thanks for the four dollars.
[485:54.99]Hey, Derm, just wanted to give you some money.
[485:56.39]P.S.
[485:56.67]My friend saw you at Shaw's two years ago.
[486:04.04]Somebody said that to me recently, too, by the way.
[486:06.38]Somebody said stop and shop.
[486:08.10]What's with the grocery stores?
[486:10.46]I swear to God, I've had conversations with people at every major grocery store.
[486:17.28]Whole Foods, Stop and Shop, Shaw's.
[486:21.95]People don't even pull me aside at TwitchCon.
[486:25.21]You understand?
[486:25.77]I went to TwitchCon last year, and I think I only got pulled aside like, hey, Jeremiah, how you doing?
[486:34.62]Maybe like three times.
[486:36.76]More people have pulled me aside in a grocery store
[486:39.88]Then TwitchCon.
[486:42.84]Why is it always a grocery store?
[486:48.70]Host an event in a supermarket.
[486:53.67]You always thought it was cool that somebody lived that close.
[486:58.55]Well, thank you, Apple Cooler.
[487:02.47]Bottom 1,000 streamer.
[487:07.39]What am I going to do?
[487:08.03]A Publix meetup.
[487:18.35]Yeah, but thank you, Epicooler.
[487:20.13]It's always a pleasure to see people.
[487:21.79]And it's always a shock, too.
[487:24.55]Sometimes, you know, I'm just sitting in line somewhere.
[487:28.45]Or actually, I went to a... I went to, like, a sub shop.
[487:35.13]And somebody at the sub shop knew who I was.
[487:38.33]And they were like, Hey, can I get a picture?
[487:41.05]And by the way, let me just reiterate something here.
[487:44.99]Like...
[487:47.24]Anytime like I'll get like food or something.
[487:49.79]I look like shit I may have not have even brushed my teeth for a whole day And I like I went to go pick up like food or went to the grocery store people like hey, man I'm just like oh shit.
[488:00.67]Oh shit.
[488:01.19]No no no no no you don't want to talk to me right now I Got my hairs all fucked up.
[488:07.22]I haven't taken a shower.
[488:09.06]I may have shit my pants like weeks ago
[488:13.79]And obviously the underwear had been washed and dried and it's clean.
[488:17.43]But the point still stands.
[488:18.49]It still happened and I'm still nervous about it.
[488:20.03]I'm still self-conscious about me doing that.
[488:23.53]But it's always very, very shocking and interesting to know.
[488:34.10]That's a random encounter.
[488:35.12]Yeah, I've seen it before.
[488:36.36]It's the copy pasty.
[488:46.29]But yeah, thank you, Apple Cooler, again.
[488:48.18]He worked for it, he worked for it, thanks for the $5.
[488:49.52]Hey, German, I got a German tongue twister for you.
[488:53.02]I'm not gonna say this until I Google Translate this.
[488:57.06]Because I'm not going to... I've got a feeling that somebody here has those words that I don't want to say in a different language.
[489:04.99]And they're about to... You know what I'm talking about?
[489:13.64]By the way, Streamlabs...
[489:15.65]why can't I just copy it why can't I just copy and paste something in my dashboard why is it so painful to do this I just want to copy and paste this that's all I want to do do you have to make it this impossible what if what have you done what are you thinking I mean why would I want to click on when I click on something on the dashboard
[489:44.83]Why are you like graying it out?
[489:46.37]No, just I don't know.
[489:47.77]Why is it like selecting this?
[489:50.93]No, just get rid of this feature.
[489:52.51]Delete it.
[489:53.43]I don't think anybody uses it.
[489:58.42]All right.
[489:58.96]Let's go to Google Translate.
[490:00.66]Here we go.
[490:01.58]This is German to English.
[490:03.44]I have to type this out because I'm not allowed to do this.
[490:15.63]Okay, this is apparently on the teeth teeth.
[490:20.69]Hold on, let me get the whole thing written out.
[490:25.79]Did I get this wrong?
[490:27.29]On the... Wait, hold on.
[490:32.90]Haunted... I can do this.
[490:41.48]And what do you know?
[490:42.96]What do you know?
[490:44.58]I see it already.
[490:46.30]I see the L word inside here.
[490:51.88]Really?
[490:52.96]Oh, you almost got it.
[490:57.28]I knew it.
[490:57.89]I fucking told you guys that was what was happening.
[490:59.85]I knew it.
[491:00.23]I was saying it out loud.
[491:01.07]That was what I was doing.
[491:01.79]I knew it.
[491:04.51]Thank you E-Words for the $5.
[491:05.39]Not tonight.
[491:05.65]Thank you.
[491:09.97]Hey, Reaper, thanks for the $1.
[491:11.05]What about the 20 Pickle Ricky emotes that were promised?
[491:13.77]The Pickle German will be available for three days in a Fortnite.
[491:23.23]Thank you, Lemon, again for the $1.
[491:24.99]The stream has been pre-recorded.
[491:26.41]Well, it is now once I hit stop.
[491:29.93]It'll happen.
[491:31.45]Asian Turtle, thanks for the $1.
[491:32.57]Hey, here's a few good horror games that I think would be fun to play on stream.
[491:38.95]You put the games over on the Discord.
[491:40.89]Home Sweet Home, Anatomy, Spooky House of Jumpscares.
[491:45.80]Anatomy is a fairly short game.
[491:47.08]Home Sweet Home and Spooky aren't too long.
[491:49.38]I'll link to where you can get them in the recommendation channel.
[491:52.54]That is exactly where they belong.
[491:55.56]And I will definitely go to Steam or wherever their respective places are and take a look.
[492:01.73]Notice that I didn't say I was going to look into that.
[492:03.95]I worded it differently.
[492:04.85]So that's how you know it's true.
[492:08.82]Maybe we'll do like a horror game night soon.
[492:11.68]I feel like I played a lot of the horror games on VR.
[492:14.80]Still fake.
[492:15.42]No, it's not.
[492:16.04]I'm saying it out loud.
[492:19.32]But thank you, Asian Turtle.
[492:22.93]Also, thank you to Jen Thura for the $1.
[492:24.83]Love you, man.
[492:25.57]Thank you.
[492:27.07]Thanks for the $1.
[492:30.09]Thank you so much to Greethan Sornos for the $1.
[492:34.47]Can you tell your Discord not to ban anyone?
[492:37.59]Who says that they're jerks.
[492:40.66]Don't ban anyone who says that they're jerks.
[492:44.56]But you said that the Discord was a jerk.
[492:46.08]I don't know the context.
[492:56.07]And I don't want to get involved in Discord drama.
[492:59.38]Let's not do Discord drama.
[493:05.44]Look, if there's a problem in that Discord, I will make that Discord only available to me in italics.
[493:13.57]And I will make sure I will have a live feed of our conversations that you cannot join in on.
[493:20.01]Just give me me and him talking about whatever the fuck.
[493:22.95]That's it.
[493:30.22]What a tyrant.
[493:31.88]Now, I'm sorry, I don't know if you got banned, but
[493:35.60]There are specific roles in there.
[493:37.68]I'm fairly sure they exist.
[493:39.36]There's a whole list of them.
[493:43.88]Thank you, Soranos, for the $1.
[493:44.66]Hopefully it gets resolved.
[493:48.70]Asian Turtle, thank you for the $1.
[493:50.18]Oh, that's from the earlier bits.
[493:52.48]Thank you, though.
[493:52.90]Thank you, Broluck, for the $1.
[493:54.19]Only three more to go.
[493:55.13]Here is a clip.
[493:56.83]Let's click it, because that's all we do is click clips.
[494:00.21]We click clips that I don't pre-screen.
[494:03.11]It's going to get me in a lot of trouble.
[494:05.50]One day.
[494:05.74]I'm going to click a clip and it's going to be a jump scare.
[494:08.23]It's going to be a screamer and I'm going to scream.
[494:11.07]Now I just said that out loud so now I have to pre-screen everything now.
[494:13.85]Great.
[494:14.13]Okay, let's see what this is.
[494:15.47]Oh, it's a new sub sound.
[494:22.89]Oh.
[494:26.39]No.
[494:26.59]No new sub sound.
[494:28.23]Not for another four years.
[494:31.05]Hey Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[494:32.29]The Rat Movie Biebs are the only good memes.
[494:33.79]Don't
[494:35.13]At me.
[494:38.59]I love rat movies.
[494:39.81]I love the rats.
[494:40.19]That's actually pretty interesting.
[494:42.55]That's really cool, actually.
[495:04.83]So people are just kind of... Wasn't there like a... I feel like a lot of tow truck companies did that for a while too.
[495:16.11]What do you mean that's the joke?
[495:17.05]Did I miss a joke?
[495:31.54]Jeremiah is not allowed to be watched in any establishment.
[495:36.02]He's always watching while driving.
[495:37.34]Don't, hey, no.
[495:38.40]Here's what you can do, right?
[495:40.34]You know how you have those, uh, when your son is watching Dora the Explorer in the backseat?
[495:46.58]Because you have one of those cars that has the viewing screen on the back of the, your chair?
[495:52.36]Well, just turn on the stream, and just put the phone in the backseat, and turn up the volume.
[496:01.23]You had one of those.
[496:01.87]I wish I had one of those when I was a kid.
[496:03.21]It'd be amazing.
[496:05.25]It's like going on an airplane every day.
[496:07.89]You get to have the cool airplane seat.
[496:11.48]But anyways, thank you for all the luck, and that sounds like a pretty interesting job.
[496:15.52]Driving around.
[496:16.24]I'm not sure if the people are inebriated, but still, thank you.
