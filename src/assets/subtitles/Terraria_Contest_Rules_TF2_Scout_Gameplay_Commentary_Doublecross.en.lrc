[00:00.76]What's going on, guys?
[00:01.72]It is Jerma, and we've got a lot to talk about today.
[00:05.16]Very, very important stuff I want to go over.
[00:07.56]The number one thing I want to talk about in this video is the fact that I'm doing a huge contest for three copies of Terraria.
[00:15.57]And I'll get into that in a minute here.
[00:17.25]I just want to give you a quick little background as to this gameplay and what's going on here.
[00:21.19]This is a scout.
[00:22.09]It's on Five Gorge.
[00:23.13]The map is going to change to CTF.
[00:26.65]Double Cross is what it is.
[00:28.47]And I'm using the Soda Popper...
[00:30.90]and the Crit-a-Cola in the Atomizer.
[00:33.50]Now, it's kind of an odd setup, because I'm losing the pistol.
[00:35.54]It's not that recommended, but it's a fun little change of pace.
[00:39.55]You're pretty much going to have crits, like, 75% of the time you're playing the game as the Scout.
[00:44.67]So, I recommend, if you want to have a little bit of fun, and you want to change it up a little bit, to go with this setup, because it is a lot of fun, and you're going to see me get kills with this thing, little streaks of, like, three or four kills in a row, that I definitely would not have been able to do if I did not have the Crit-a-Cola.
[01:00.28]So this gameplay is going to kind of sit in the background a little bit.
[01:02.76]I want to really talk about this contest I want to try and do.
[01:06.02]And it should be a whole lot of fun.
[01:07.52]It should involve pretty much all of you that are currently subscribed.
[01:10.32]Or maybe if you're new to the channel, how you doing?
[01:12.58]I'm Jerma.
[01:13.34]And maybe you'll be able to win Terraria.
[01:15.44]So here's how it's going to work.
[01:17.28]Terraria, if you buy four copies of the game, it is cheaper.
[01:21.21]I think it's like $10 cheaper.
[01:22.37]Rather than $40, it's $30 if you buy four copies.
[01:25.61]I'm going to buy four copies of Terraria and
[01:29.58]Three of them are going to be up for grabs in a contest.
[01:32.80]Now, what are the contests?
[01:34.36]What are they?
[01:34.94]What are you going to do?
[01:35.60]What games?
[01:36.08]Is it going to be Team Fortress?
[01:38.17]There will be three separate contests.
[01:41.99]One of them is going to be for Team Fortress 2.
[01:44.57]One of them will be for Minecraft.
[01:46.63]And the other one is not going to involve any games at all, because I know some people don't play Team Fortress, or they don't own Minecraft, or their computer's not good enough to run.
[01:55.76]You know, TF2, they just like watching the gameplays.
[01:58.67]There's going to be one of the contests for the third copy that's going to involve comments.
[02:04.16]I'm going to upload a picture at the end of this video.
[02:07.56]It's going to be right at the end of the video.
[02:09.44]It's going to be a picture of something.
[02:11.92]And what you're going to have to do is you're going to have to comment on that picture.
[02:15.60]And we'll talk about what you have to comment, what the criteria is.
[02:18.48]But that's how to involve you, whoever you are, that do not own any of these games.
[02:24.59]And maybe your computer's not good enough or whatever the case may be.
[02:28.34]That's how you can be involved.
[02:30.86]The first contest is going to be for Team Fortress 2.
[02:34.46]You have to send me a replay on here.
[02:37.04]Make it a video response to this video.
[02:39.70]You have to send me, as a video response, you and Team Fortress 2, less than 30 seconds, by the way.
[02:46.19]I don't want, like, 25 minute, like, frag videos.
[02:50.21]Something that's really funny, or really crazy, or really stupid.
[02:55.36]Something that you did that you thought was just like, oh my god, that was so stupid, or that was so funny, like something like that.
[03:02.35]And it has to be less than 30 seconds long.
[03:04.77]Use the replay feature, it's awesome.
[03:06.86]Just make a YouTube account if you don't have one.
[03:09.18]It's a lot of fun.
[03:10.30]And maybe you'll get addicted to it, and maybe you'll keep making videos, and I really encourage that.
[03:14.96]But that's the first contest.
[03:17.17]You can't be longer than 30 seconds, and it has to be something funny, crazy, or stupid.
[03:21.67]I don't want frag videos.
[03:23.23]I just want something fun and interesting, and whoever, in my opinion, has the funniest, funnest, like, most stupid, funny thing is going to win one copy of Terraria.
[03:33.91]And that's going to be one week from now, so you only have one week to do this.
[03:37.86]The reason why I'm making it one week is because I know that people will spend so much time trying to
[03:43.90]find a way to win and they'll spend up they'll not they won't work they won't like go to school so one week that's it make it a video response to this video and make sure you name it Jerma contest or Terraria Jerma contest make sure like I know what the video it is so I'm not looking around like trying to find people's videos that are stuffed in their hundreds of uploads or something
[04:07.14]Contest number two is going to be from Minecraft.
[04:11.83]What you have to do is again make a video response to this video.
[04:16.87]Name it Jerma Minecraft Terraria Contest or something like that in Minecraft.
[04:23.56]You have to make something.
[04:25.26]This is also a one-week deadline, by the way.
[04:27.64]I don't want people to go insane and build, like, a friggin' castle and spend, like, a thousand hours on it.
[04:34.37]I just want you to do something fun, something quick, something funny.
[04:38.01]Something that has to do with this channel, with my name.
[04:41.91]Make fun of me.
[04:42.85]You can troll me with it.
[04:44.01]I don't care.
[04:44.67]Just have fun with it.
[04:46.55]But whoever has, like, the funniest, you know, building or the funniest creation in Minecraft...
[04:52.13]is going to win a copy of Terraria.
[04:54.07]Remember, this is all in my opinion, so if you think that Joe Schmoe's video sucked and Dave Stevenson's video was like way better, I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.
[05:06.24]It's just my opinion, so I'm the only judge, so you can't like... I mean, there's not like 12 judges, it's just me.
[05:14.42]So that's that contest.
[05:16.16]Make it a video response.
[05:17.70]Less than 30 seconds.
[05:18.98]Just show me what you built.
[05:20.69]show me making fun of me or making a joke or something like that or something interesting.
[05:24.93]Whoever has the coolest thing is going to win.
[05:26.83]That's that contest.
[05:28.71]And the final contest is going to be for comments.
[05:32.52]I brought this up before.
[05:34.52]How this is going to work is in this video, this video right here, this is the only video that counts, at the end of this video there is going to be a picture.
[05:46.17]And what you have to do is you have to make a comment about that picture that's uploaded
[05:50.82]at the very end of the video and make sure you name it like when you're doing your comment don't just write it make sure you type in you know we'll go make sure you write Jerma contest dash then your comment because there are people that are going to even be involved they're just going to be commenting on the gameplay or the video or me or something like that so make sure if you're entering in the comment contest you write Jerma contest dash and then your comment and your response to whatever the picture happens to be
[06:19.13]Whoever has the best comment, in my opinion, it's not whoever gets the most rates, you know, bump it up.
[06:25.60]Oh, whoever gets the most thumbs up.
[06:26.86]No, no, no.
[06:27.22]It's my opinion.
[06:28.20]I'm going to read every single one of these comments five times and make the decision who gets Terraria.
[06:34.06]And only comment once.
[06:36.28]I'm going to be able to tell if you're making 50 different accounts and coming on here and doing it.
[06:41.13]So don't even try that.
[06:43.59]Only do it once.
[06:44.61]Make it fair.
[06:45.21]Make it fun.
[06:45.79]And...
[06:47.27]That's pretty much all there is to this whole contest.
[06:50.63]I'm going to write all these rules down.
[06:52.63]They will all be in the description if you are lost or if you're like, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[06:56.95]Every question you have will be answered in the description.
[06:59.97]And at the end of the video, I'll do another big little list of things that you need to know.
[07:05.31]So good luck, everybody.
[07:07.69]I know that a lot of you guys are going to come up with some crazy, funny stuff.
[07:11.33]Also, by the way, I forgot to mention, in the Minecraft competition...
[07:15.78]If you don't have Fraps or you don't have some kind of screen capture software, make a few screenshots and send them to me.
[07:22.66]I will put them in my inbox.
[07:24.22]I will look at them.
[07:24.92]Don't worry.
[07:25.36]You will not be forgotten.
[07:27.08]And good luck, everybody.
