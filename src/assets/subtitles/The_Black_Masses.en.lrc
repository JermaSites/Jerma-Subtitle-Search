[00:46.30]I know I'm late.
[00:46.90]I'm sorry.
[00:47.38]I got snagged.
[00:49.42]You know when like you have something to do and like you're like, oh, it's fine.
[00:52.18]And then all of a sudden like it pops up at 2.59 PM.
[00:55.98]You're like, no, you just can't.
[00:57.12]Don't pop this up right now.
[01:02.65]Snagged by the toilet.
[01:05.23]No, that can happen.
[01:07.25]What you're describing is very real, right?
[01:10.25]That didn't happen to me.
[01:12.15]But at 2.59, if like you, I don't know, feeling a little woozy down there, you're going to have to go.
[01:19.16]That didn't happen to me.
[01:25.16]John Cena, thanks for the 10 subs.
[01:28.50]Did you do it twice?
[01:31.18]Wait, John Cena is killed.
[01:33.02]Did you do two different 10 community subs in a row?
[01:37.85]Holy shit.
[01:38.43]Well, thank you, John Cena.
[01:40.53]You're late, mister.
[01:42.97]I know.

[02:23.32]When that comes out, I'm going to play it.
[02:24.32]I thought that wasn't coming up for a while.

[02:36.75]The backup game is going to be so good because the backup game, are you ready for this?

[02:42.84]I can't tell you what the backup game is because everyone's going to freak out and be like, dude, play the backup game right now.
[02:49.66]Fuck this game.
[02:51.20]No, hold on.
[02:52.54]It's a backup game for a reason.

[04:51.99]In fact, this game has been on the poll for the last like seven polls.
[04:59.97]And nobody ever picks it.
[05:01.91]So it's time for me to pick it.
[05:03.31]It's time for me to say we're playing it.

[06:10.91]This is like an RPG, guys.
[06:11.75]This is not just like a game where you run around and hit stuff.
[06:14.33]There's like a quest giver and stuff.
[06:16.64]I've been trying to play this for like three months.
[06:18.24]I'm going to do it.

[08:05.68]It's actually Skyrim.
[08:07.74]When I open up my chest, press action button to open.
[08:13.68]15 FPS?
[08:14.24]No it's not.
[08:17.80]What am I supposed to do?
[08:21.50]Wait, options.
[08:23.91]Alright, wait, wait, wait, hold on, wait.
[08:25.75]Yeah, I put it on medium, alright?
[08:27.55]You got a problem with that?
[08:29.11]I put it on medium, because I knew there was going to be like 5,000 people on the screen.
[08:31.93]I put the terrain at high.
[08:33.99]Alright, terrain is at high.
[08:42.06]New quest.
[08:43.16]Something isn't right.
[08:44.62]Scavenge for supplies.
[08:45.74]Alright, sick.

[08:53.29]Find a health potion.
[08:54.67]Find a light source.
[08:55.55]Find a weapon.
[08:56.25]Make your way down the road.
[08:57.63]Alright, let's go.
[09:00.05]Whoa.

[09:16.05]Alright, I promise I'll put it all on potato eventually.
[09:18.89]Alright, I will tell ya.
[09:22.47]This looks like I'm watching a stream at like 3,000 up.
[09:28.23]I feel like the bitrate, I feel like I'm playing this through a stadia.
[09:31.75]You're seeing right now the reason why not to buy one of those.
[09:35.37]Oh, look!
[09:35.85]Oh, quest!
[09:37.25]Hold jump to initiate a climb.
[09:38.91]Press W. What the fuck?
[09:43.20]Are you serious?
[09:47.84]Alright, this game just got way cooler.
[09:49.44]That was pretty cool.
[09:50.44]Alright, that was pretty cool.
[09:51.50]Alright, what's in here?
[09:54.30]A sword?
[09:57.54]Nothing even in here.
[10:07.59]Oh, health potion.
[10:09.67]And a key.
[10:11.71]Find a health potion.
[10:12.57]Health potion found.

[10:17.23]Oh, shit.
[10:17.87]Nice.
[10:19.53]Oh, this is a key to Kane's house.
[10:20.81]Can you apologize?
[10:28.26]Uh, I'm sorry.
[10:33.22]Alright, I got the key to Kane's house.
[10:34.30]I'm good.
[10:34.56]Do you have to eat in this game?
[10:40.64]Is it fall damage?
[10:42.97]Nope.
[10:46.53]Alright, here's the key to Kane's house.
[10:49.18]Alright, does Kane live here?
[10:50.90]Should we be worried about Kane being upset that I was coming in his house?
[11:01.39]Does anybody live in this town?
[11:11.43]What do I need?
[11:11.91]I need a weapon.
[11:14.03]Oh, hold, wait a minute.
[11:15.83]What the?
[11:19.13]Uh, can you hit somebody with a feather?
[11:23.65]Is that a cane?
[11:24.27]It's gonna be a screamer.
[11:26.12]Here it comes.
[11:27.76]Is there a punch?
[11:30.46]Cane?
[11:31.66]Hello?
[11:37.24]Oh, this guy's actually kind of scary.
[11:39.56]I don't like this guy.
[11:43.02]Shovel.
[11:43.70]Oh, no.
[11:48.60]Are you serious?
[11:51.06]I thought it was going to be a sword.
[11:52.52]Are you kidding me?
[11:57.81]Find a weapon.
[11:58.65]Okay.
[12:00.99]Well, hold on.
[12:01.83]That means I have to kill the guy down there.
[12:08.19]He's alive down there.
[12:08.99]Yeah, I can hear him.
[12:11.04]You picked up a weapon.
[12:11.76]Press attack to equip or open your inventory for more options.
[12:15.36]Well, hold on.
[12:18.25]Where is he now?
[12:19.83]Oh, footbridge.
[12:26.53]This is actually... Okay, I'm into this.
[12:28.29]Let's go.
[12:31.92]Oh, shit.
[12:32.30]There he is.
[12:32.68]Okay.
[12:35.48]Press the attack...
[12:38.60]Holy shit, I peeled his face off.
[12:41.04]Hold on, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[12:42.02]I ripped his entire mouth off.
[12:47.14]I'm just, like, skinning his head.
[12:48.69]Is he dead?
[12:54.95]Okay, I think he's dead.
[13:04.78]I hit him so hard, I ripped his face off.
[13:06.60]Alright.
[13:07.48]How do you take a health potion?
[13:15.37]Oh, that's- I gotta go there, okay.
[13:18.59]Frames?
[13:19.93]Yeah, we might have to make the graphics way worse.
[13:24.69]We're probably gonna have to have the graphics be terrible because that was one guy on screen and it's like stuttering in 40 FPS.
[13:31.63]The Steam page of this game touts potentially hundreds of people on screen.
[13:42.40]OK, let's go.
[13:44.71]Check your map for quest markers.
[13:46.75]Holy shit, it's like DayZ.
[13:49.07]What the fuck?
[13:51.74]Wait a minute.
[13:52.40]Wait a minute.
[13:53.02]Wait a minute.
[13:53.90]Everybody slow down for a second.
[13:55.46]Are you serious?
[13:56.84]This is huge.
[14:01.28]This is monstrous.
[14:05.93]This is the early access map.
[14:13.73]Okay.
[14:14.51]We're going this way apparently.
[14:16.81]Find a safe space.
[14:17.89]That's very surprising.
[14:23.56]Find a safe space?
[14:24.84]Alright, I'm just going to go... That's my stamina in the middle.
[14:34.81]Alright.
[14:39.87]Our most ambitious title to date.
[14:48.58]Oh, shit.
[14:49.38]A human.
[14:51.44]No, wait.
[14:51.72]That's a zombie.

[15:33.09]I'm getting there.
[15:33.63]Alright, we're gonna go to Strathsphere.
[15:35.13]Nice.
[15:43.25]Dodge?
[15:43.87]Okay.
[15:50.63]Oh shit, that hurt.
[15:51.56]The person has a t-shirt on?
[15:54.46]Do they have t-shirts in medieval times?
[15:57.44]Oh, there's blood all over this shirt.
[15:58.64]I thought it was like a graphic tee.
[16:01.68]Alright, level up.
[16:05.64]How do I- How do I- Quick pointer.
[16:08.84]Open blessings menu.
[16:09.76]What the hell is the blessings menu?
[16:13.51]Blessings.
[16:14.89]What the hell?
[16:17.31]Strength.
[16:19.11]Perform a 360 degree spin to clear enemies around you with a flaming sword.
[16:24.97]Uh...
[16:27.88]Fire three normal projectiles in a horizontal spread.
[16:30.62]I need a bow.
[16:31.12]There's guns?
[16:33.06]There are guns in this game.
[16:36.40]Dark Arts.
[16:38.12]Allows instantaneous travel to previously visited safe zones or stamina regenerates while in combat.
[16:43.33]I don't know what to do.
[16:46.35]It's Skyrim with guns.
[16:48.81]Yeah.
[16:52.11]I think I'm just going to do strength.
[16:53.17]That's the easiest, right?
[16:53.97]I'm going to do strength.
[16:59.31]Oh, look at that.
[17:02.53]How do I do that?
[17:04.83]How do I do that move?
[17:16.42]Oh, that was nice.
[17:18.04]I'm intrigued at this game.
[17:18.92]I'm not done.
[17:21.44]I wish it would run maybe 5% better, but I'm kind of into it.
[17:26.22]I'm into it right now.
[17:27.08]I want to know what it is in store for me here.
[17:33.32]You have to put it on potato.
[17:38.24]Okay, reflections, potato.
[17:39.60]I get you.
[17:40.50]Post-processing, low.
[17:43.34]Trees.
[17:44.46]Get that off.
[17:46.14]Shadows and rendering.
[17:47.13]You can put that on high.
[17:49.55]Okay, let's see how that looks.
[17:59.37]Who likes reflections in games anyways?
[18:03.76]This looks better now.
[18:05.04]I actually think this looks better.
[18:08.38]I hate reflections.
[18:09.46]It's too much.
[18:09.92]Okay, I'm almost there.
[18:14.98]I gotta bang a left.
[18:23.49]How do I do the 360 spin?
[18:24.23]Is somebody behind me?
[18:25.63]Oh, shit.
[18:26.11]Okay, hold on.
[18:27.03]360 spin.
[18:27.47]How do I do it?
[18:31.45]That was stupid.
[18:33.09]Okay, that was stupid.
[18:33.95]With an oar, that's not intimidating.
[18:35.73]That's pretty stupid.
[18:38.86]How much does it take?
[18:47.02]I like this game.
[18:47.72]You want me to lie to you?
[18:50.12]Sure.
[18:51.12]I hate this game.
[18:51.84]This is your lie.
[18:52.66]Here's the truth.
[18:53.30]I like this.
[19:02.73]All potato.
[19:03.72]No, I don't want to do all potato.
[19:06.52]Take that!
[19:12.46]I can't wait to get more items.
[19:15.40]Maybe it's just this area that is choppy.
[19:17.70]Maybe it'll even out.
[19:19.52]This is the town, right?
[19:20.34]Yeah, okay.
[19:25.33]Uh, wait.
[19:26.65]Parkour.
[19:28.93]Yeah, don't fight.
[19:29.43]Why would I fight?
[19:29.87]I'm just gonna get killed.
[19:31.82]This is bread?
[19:33.38]Okay.
[19:33.76]I don't... They probably can't climb, right?
[19:35.96]Can they climb?
[19:39.40]Oh, Jesus.
[19:40.14]Okay.
[19:40.40]Hold on.
[19:40.66]All right.
[19:43.03]I'm not going to go that.
[19:43.65]We're going to go in the house.
[19:47.01]Done.
[19:48.37]Room.
[19:48.51]All right.
[19:52.13]What's better?
[19:52.53]The bro... Wait.
[19:55.95]Wait, wait, wait.
[19:56.49]Can they come in the house?
[19:57.18]Wait.
[20:01.64]I want to use the broom.
[20:02.54]How do I put... How do I put... There it is.
[20:04.02]This is light.
[20:21.61]This thing sucks.
[20:23.21]This guy has no arms.
[20:24.29]This is terrible.
[20:27.46]The broom is not good.
[20:31.69]You're hitting him with the hay end.
[20:33.17]Yeah, it's like a bug.
[20:35.03]It's like a spider on the wall.
[20:38.75]Okay, hold on.
[20:39.65]How much health do I heal with a health potion?
[20:42.04]Ooh, what's this?
[20:42.64]Repair kit.
[20:48.96]Okay, no more fucking around.
[20:49.70]Give me the ore.
[20:57.59]I need- where's- is there any townspeople?
[21:00.20]I'm just running.
[21:01.56]Yeah, fuck it.
[21:02.02]I'm just gonna run.
[21:07.28]Wait, church, church, church, church.
[21:08.70]Alright, I found a safe zone.
[21:13.79]Open!
[21:15.53]Are you human?
[21:17.57]A human!
[21:19.03]Okay, what- hello?
[21:20.05]Thank God!
[21:25.91]Oh, another human.
[21:27.51]What happened here?
[21:29.47]They're all possessed.
[21:30.91]Where have you been?
[21:33.01]Something happened to my ship and it sank in the night.
[21:34.99]I woke up on the shore.
[21:36.15]What do you mean possessed?
[21:37.31]Something happened to my ship and it sank in the night.
[21:39.35]I woke up on the shore.
[21:40.47]What do you mean possessed?
[21:43.55]I don't fully understand it myself.
[21:44.90]It has something to do with the black liquid they found by Servadia.
[21:49.32]After people started to drink it, they started to change.
[21:52.08]I see.
[21:53.63]They're all possessed.
[21:54.77]Where have you been?
[21:56.01]Something happened to my ship.
[21:57.05]It sank in the night.
[21:57.95]I woke up on the shore.
[22:00.25]Well, glad to see someone normal.
[22:02.25]Maybe we can help each other.
[22:04.17]Any chance you can help me get off this island?
[22:08.24]You're asking for a miracle.
[22:10.04]But it's possible there might be others left who can help.
[22:13.44]Any idea where I can find any other survivors?
[22:16.26]Many fled to Fort Wyver.
[22:18.30]It's a short walk down the road, but I fear the worst.
[22:21.48]It's too quiet now.
[22:23.23]I'll check that out.
[22:24.17]I can't kill him.
[22:29.05]What if I need him later?
[22:31.79]I don't want to do the flaming ore spin.
[22:34.05]No, I can't.
[22:46.07]How do I save the game?
[22:46.83]Do you sleep in beds like Skyrim?
[22:57.20]Wait, I can steal from him.
[22:59.48]Does he care?
[23:04.82]We might need this guy later.
[23:06.23]I can't.
[23:08.49]Finish him.
[23:09.11]He's not even... What do you mean finish him?
[23:10.33]He's fine.
[23:11.09]He's like alive.
[23:17.61]Wait, let me back in.
[23:18.13]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[23:18.97]Where are we going?
[23:21.89]Hey, we're going to go this way.
[23:22.63]I need to have the weapon.
[23:32.86]Oh, shit.
[23:42.31]All right, let's go.
[23:48.47]Alright, I gotta go up and then right.
[23:52.42]Is there a boat?
[23:57.14]Boat, boat, boat, boat, boat, boat, boat, boat, boat.
[23:59.07]Does it work?
[24:00.83]No, it doesn't.
[24:01.37]They can't swim, right?
[24:02.11]Can I swim?
[24:02.57]Holy shit!
[24:05.59]What the fuck is happening?
[24:11.07]What the fuck was that?
[24:12.53]What the fuck is that thing?
[24:13.99]What the fuck is that thing?
[24:15.33]What is that thing?
[24:16.75]What is that thing?
[24:18.97]I have no idea.
[24:21.13]Okay, I gotta get out of here.
[24:22.13]I gotta get out.
[24:22.73]This is too much for my brain.
[24:24.14]This is too much for my brain.
[24:28.76]Why is that person still alive?
[24:30.14]I have to loot the houses?
[24:32.56]Yeah, well, hold on a second.
[24:36.20]What the fuck?
[24:37.12]Why is there...
[24:45.37]What did that guy even say in the water?
[24:47.43]He just went like... That was way scarier than if he said any actual words.
[24:54.59]That's all I heard.
[24:59.21]That was terrifying.
[25:05.98]This is more finished than Cyberpunk.
[25:10.86]Okay, I need to find weapons.
[25:14.14]I'm not an arrow guy, though.
[25:15.26]Ooh, wait a minute.
[25:18.94]Tomato.
[25:20.40]Blessing.
[25:22.77]Simple potion to refill your powers.
[25:25.53]Oh, shit.
[25:25.97]Okay.
[25:27.01]Health potion.
[25:27.95]Blessing potion.
[25:34.11]Cyberpunk joke.
[25:38.26]Now the funniest thing I've seen of Cyberpunk is when the guy is on the roof and he spins in 360 degrees and there's nothing around him and he like shoots somebody down like a thousand feet below him and like police spawn behind him on the roof.
[26:00.94]Okay, I gotta loot more houses.
[26:09.03]This game is so crunchy, but I mean, I kind of like it.
[26:12.35]I kind of like this.
[26:14.95]I just wish it ran.
[26:15.91]I just need to... Oh my... Okay, we're in trouble.
[26:23.39]I gotta... I'm cutting off all their arms.
[26:32.04]Get...
[26:38.54]Health potion.
[26:42.10]That lady is so bloody.
[26:46.61]I'm going to level up.
[26:51.65]Is there a block?
[26:54.73]I don't think so.
[27:00.81]My son is watching.
[27:01.57]Can you please limit the violence?
[27:09.91]I was trying to hit this person in the head as much as I could.
[27:13.25]Level up.
[27:13.53]Is that a bomb?
[27:15.80]Holy shit, there's bombs.
[27:20.96]There are bombs.
[27:22.92]Knife.
[27:25.06]Where's the knife?
[27:28.48]Inventory.
[27:30.60]Table knife.
[27:33.46]Okay, get rid of the broom.
[27:35.27]Table knife in.
[27:36.79]How do I use that?
[27:39.35]It's a thrown item?
[27:41.43]Holy shit.
[27:42.23]Oh, shit.
[27:42.83]What?
[27:43.43]Hold on.
[27:44.25]Can I eat a tomato?
[27:47.39]How do I throw an item?
[27:53.45]Uh, V?
[27:54.91]V. G?
[27:56.77]Vow scroll?
[27:59.81]Grenade?
[28:00.21]Yeah, there's grenades in medieval times.
[28:02.43]There were.
[28:05.08]Q. Wait.
[28:06.40]Q. Oh, that's how you drink a potion.
[28:08.46]Okay.
[28:08.72]Well, that's good to know.
[28:11.39]D. F. H. J. Go to Fort Wyver.
[28:17.79]Okay.
[28:19.61]Um.
[28:20.21]Wait.
[28:20.35]Let me look at the.
[28:20.91]Can I look at controls?
[28:22.03]Inputs.
[28:22.31]Okay.
[28:23.91]Toggle sprint.
[28:24.45]Enable item and consumable scrolling.
[28:27.77]Match camera sensitivity.
[28:29.11]Wait.
[28:30.31]No.
[28:31.89]Okay.
[28:32.15]Jump.
[28:32.49]Attack.
[28:32.93]Block is mouse two.
[28:34.54]Okay.
[28:36.47]Mouse 2 is my super move.
[28:37.61]Bash is F. Usability is Mouser.
[28:42.56]Like from Mario 2.
[28:45.84]Okay.
[28:47.62]Scroll.
[28:48.62]Sprint.
[28:49.30]Sneak.
[28:51.16]Use.
[28:51.42]Okay.
[28:52.00]It's G and B. G and B. Do I not have it equipped?
[29:03.55]Could be G and B, right?
[29:04.99]G. B. Huh.
[29:11.18]I'll figure it out.
[29:13.80]Is that corn?
[29:17.54]Repair kit.
[29:21.56]B on the controller.
[29:22.55]I love the music.
[29:27.73]It's just like a violin.
[29:28.91]Oh, come here, you.
[29:35.35]Is there a sword on the ground?
[29:36.11]I didn't even see it.
[29:37.93]Or is there a sword?
[29:42.44]Oh shit!
[29:48.38]Oh my god, I have a sword.
[30:00.01]Horn.
[30:03.26]Oh, nice.
[30:04.58]Sword's pretty good.
[30:05.22]Nice.
[30:10.71]Okay, cool.
[30:11.27]I don't even know what I picked up.
[30:13.07]I'm just touching everything.
[30:14.53]More rusty broken sword?
[30:15.89]No, what?
[30:18.59]Can I throw this?
[30:24.10]Can I sell something to somebody eventually?
[30:25.52]Dual weld.
[30:27.58]Can you?
[30:29.50]No, you can't.
[30:35.16]You can dual weld.
[30:35.76]No, you can't.
[30:37.22]Maybe you can get a shield eventually, though.
[30:44.29]Stay on a potion.
[30:45.67]Dual weld.
[30:46.59]Dual... Dual wield.
[30:49.29]Sorry.
[30:49.61]What do you want me to say?
[30:51.71]Sorry.
[30:52.09]Dual wield.
[30:53.55]Dual wielding.
[30:57.49]Can you cleave?
[31:00.00]If you can cleave, this skill goes up a lot of grade.
[31:01.46]I don't think you can.
[31:05.96]Holy shit, you can do that though.
[31:12.36]What are you in here?
[31:13.62]No.
[31:14.92]Second breath potion that decreases your stamina, but only for a little while and some arrows and was it brass knuckles?
[31:21.01]Must get ammo.
[31:23.59]Dude, I can't.
[31:24.81]Alright, I can't wait.
[31:26.11]I'm having fun.
[31:27.87]And there's tomatoes in the game.
[31:32.23]Alright.
[31:33.55]Is it a kitchen knife?
[31:38.82]How do I get rid of all this stuff?
[31:45.68]There's a tomato, so there's plus one letter grade.
[31:50.24]Yeah.
[31:51.62]I'll take that.
[31:53.26]That's not a bad indicator.
[31:55.58]But hold on.
[31:56.06]Excuse me, sir.
[31:58.00]A equippable tomato.
[32:01.81]A pick-up-able tomato.
[32:04.25]Not just one for decoration.
[32:05.67]That's really important to distinction.
[32:06.97]Alright, let's go.
[32:08.89]I have to go this way.
[32:11.65]Alright.
[32:12.70]I'm going to run for it.
[32:17.37]Made up.
[32:19.03]You can throw these.
[32:20.01]I gotta figure that out.
[32:20.85]You can throw tomatoes at people?
[32:23.09]Alright, I need to go... Okay, we're just gonna... We're just gonna parkour.
[32:30.14]And not parkour?
[32:30.80]Okay, hold on.
[32:34.14]He's way too high.
[32:35.04]I feel like this is water.
[32:37.57]This looks like water.
[32:42.51]Going the right way?
[32:43.35]Yeah, alright.
[32:44.07]Let's keep it going.
[32:52.62]Very crunchy water.
[32:54.88]Sorry, it's OK.
[32:55.83]That guy is so far away.
[32:57.31]His LOD is like 1 FPS.
[32:59.83]He's not a threat at all.
[33:00.85]His AI doesn't even know I'm over here.
[33:02.09]That's just an animation.
[33:02.87]Don't worry, we're fine.
[33:12.56]Anybody in here?
[33:13.00]I kind of want a handgun.
[33:21.37]Or use the rusty sword for the tetanus bonus.
[33:26.29]Thank you Kai's Kitchen for the five community subs.
[33:28.75]Appreciate it.
[33:31.77]Can I throw corn at people?
[33:32.91]I hope so.
[33:36.88]What the hell is this?
[33:37.98]A bone?
[33:41.86]Like a dog bone?
[33:54.52]Oh, let me get a nice sip of my tea.
[33:56.30]Hey, by the way, if you don't have like a tea or water or, you know, coffee or something, take the time.
[34:01.64]It's an opportunity to go gamble.
[34:06.78]Alright, what?
[34:07.12]There's a door?
[34:14.36]What happened?
[34:17.30]Oh, there's a day-night cycle in this game.
[34:19.80]I thought there was something wrong with my game.
[34:26.43]I thought the render distance went to zero.
[34:28.52]Alright, I'm going up.
[34:32.96]Can I sleep here?
[34:40.36]Is it worse at night?
[34:41.48]Is it scarier at night?
[34:42.50]Need another point in strength.
[34:53.90]Three blessing points.
[34:55.22]Three.
[34:56.34]What?
[34:57.88]Do I have to wait until I get to level... Oh, I get to get to level five.
[35:00.54]Okay, I see.
[35:02.06]This is going pure strength.
[35:05.28]Are you telling me you don't want me to get the huge two-hander?
[35:07.53]And be able to chop up like a hundred people in one swing?
[35:15.21]Guns are cool.
[35:15.81]Bows are cool.
[35:16.49]But huge two-hander is what I want.
[35:20.51]Holy shit, this is awful.
[35:22.29]I'm just going to stay on the path this way.
[35:24.83]How do I get over this?
[35:28.10]I got to go on the road.
[35:28.74]There's a road from here.
[35:31.00]All right.
[35:42.67]Alright, it sucks, but you know what?
[35:43.85]We're just gonna run.
[35:45.39]Okay, um, we're going this way.
[35:47.85]Yep, okay, then bang a left at the end of the road.
[35:50.83]Right?
[35:51.11]Oh my god, just jump.
[35:53.75]Right?
[35:53.93]Am I going the right way?
[35:54.61]Then bang a left.
[36:05.46]Ooh, right in the chest.
[36:15.39]Oh, fuck.
[36:15.79]Hold on.
[36:19.70]Cool.
[36:20.00]Okay.
[36:20.20]I'm good.
[36:20.46]I'm good.
[36:20.66]I'm good.
[36:20.86]I'm good.
[36:21.04]We're going to the town.
[36:21.64]All right.
[36:23.22]Just fuck everybody.
[36:24.08]I'm running.
[36:24.42]All right.
[36:27.92]Do you let this guy in?
[36:28.66]The guy running towards the gate with the sword going, help me.
[36:34.16]Help.
[36:34.66]They're after me.
[36:35.78]Open the gate.
[36:37.38]Open the gate.
[36:39.76]You open the gate, right?
[36:41.34]Or am I the guy that does that and then just gets absolutely slaughtered by like 50 people and they tear me apart?
[36:46.44]Oh my God!
[36:51.20]What?
[36:54.47]What the fuck is happening over here?
[36:56.67]Run away?
[36:57.35]Oh my Jesus Christ!
[37:06.13]Oh my god, they're like a pack of ants.
[37:08.19]I found an ant hill.
[37:09.57]Holy shit, they're still running after me.
[37:14.03]Where am I supposed to go?
[37:16.93]Where am I supposed to go?
[37:18.37]They're all after me.
[37:21.90]It's chat.
[37:22.88]Get in here and close the door.
[37:28.64]Holy fucking shit, dude.
[37:31.42]Oh my god, that was actually terrifying.
[37:45.58]that was insane so what that town got overrun by the ants that was ridiculous I can't believe that I'm just gonna farm exp how do you sleep
[38:25.86]They're not still out here, right?
[38:27.12]They're not just waiting for me like a Disney bride?
[38:34.76]Can I not sleep?
[38:47.85]Uh, journal.
[38:49.21]Go to Fort Wyver and look for survivors.
[38:51.37]Um, how am I supposed to do that?
[38:55.89]Oh, I have to go back.
[39:02.20]I gotta go back and talk to the priest.
[39:04.54]Okay, I'm going for it.
[39:07.64]Run?
[39:10.22]What?
[39:21.17]Oh, but they're on every single road.
[39:25.93]Oh, man.
[39:26.63]All right.
[39:35.41]Can the priest help me?
[39:38.29]Oh, Jesus.

[39:39.39]All right.
[39:47.07]In here.
[39:47.65]In here.
[39:47.99]Get off that map.
[40:04.54]I swear to God, if this place is full of people, I'm gonna be so mad.
[40:09.62]Hold on.
[40:11.49]What the fuck just happened?
[40:13.61]Oh, okay.
[40:16.93]Ow!
[40:19.79]Alright, hey, dude, let me in.
[40:21.17]You don't have any idea what happened out there.
[40:22.96]Listen.
[40:26.24]How much food do you have?
[40:28.61]They're all possessed.
[40:29.41]There are thousands outside the fort walls.
[40:32.61]Sir, everyone has turned.
[40:34.67]I was afraid of this.
[40:36.13]But while you were gone, I saw a few survivors enter the town, but it looked like they were in trouble.
[40:41.07]Well, they're dead.
[40:42.81]They were being chased by the possessed.
[40:44.69]They appear to be held up in the tower.
[40:46.56]I'm sure they could use some help.
[40:48.72]Right.
[40:49.00]Well, I just want to let you know that was me.
[40:51.76]You were looking out the window.
[40:52.58]You saw me running away.
[40:53.82]I bumped up in the tower.
[40:59.54]You were looking at me, man.
[41:02.46]Okay, we have to go to the tower.
[41:08.27]What?
[41:10.79]What is he saying?
[41:14.87]Okay, so there are survivors up in there.
[41:16.85]Gotta go in the tower and help them.
[41:27.18]Alright, are they in here?
[41:32.59]What the fuck, man?
[41:34.05]Why?
[41:36.03]Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up on the boat.
[41:37.43]Get up.
[41:42.22]I need to throw a grenade over there.

[42:49.09]G. X. Oh, there we go.
[42:53.03]Okay.
[42:54.61]So I'm going to throw a grenade in that crowd.
[43:00.87]Where are they?
[43:01.29]Where are they?
[43:01.67]Where are they?
[43:02.05]Where are they?
[43:07.75]I didn't hit a single person?
[43:10.68]Eat it!
[43:13.38]Get him!
[43:14.06]Get him!
[43:18.74]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[43:19.38]What do I do?
[43:20.54]What do I do?
[43:20.96]What do I do?
[43:22.34]What do I do?
[43:23.07]What do I do?
[43:23.45]What do I do?
[43:23.81]What do I do?
[43:24.47]What do I do?
[43:24.85]What do I do?
[43:25.63]What do I do?
[43:26.07]They can't get me.
[43:27.11]They can't get me.
[43:31.99]Get him off!
[43:32.37]Get him off!
[43:32.76]Get him off!
[43:34.10]Get off me!
[43:37.38]This guy's hitting the ground.
[43:40.82]Oh my god.
[43:41.30]I have to leave now.
[43:42.58]I have to leave now.
[43:43.52]Wait!
[43:43.79]Wait!
[43:47.31]I'm going to farm so much experience.
[43:48.81]You have no idea.
[43:56.40]This is just what it feels like in Warcraft.
[43:59.25]When everyone's on their flying mount.
[44:01.37]And they're just going, they're freaking the fuck out all around you.
[44:04.21]They're just waiting for the portal to be open.
[44:14.10]This probably looks so stupid from an outside perspective.
[44:17.74]Warcraft reference?
[44:18.56]Yeah.
[44:19.10]Don't care.
[44:21.82]Got it.
[44:23.10]I'm gonna kill, I'm gonna get to level four.
[44:24.34]Wait, it's daylight.
[44:26.62]Does that mean anything?
[44:37.11]I don't think so.
[44:47.38]They're just extra hungry.
[44:49.46]Alright, can I crouch?
[45:08.82]I can't take it.
[45:09.45]I have to leave.
[45:10.11]I have to get up.
[45:10.67]I... Just hit him in the fucking head.
[45:18.37]Just hit their head.
[45:20.99]Quick, eat a tomato.
[45:23.93]I got it.
[45:24.21]I ate one.
[45:24.69]Did I?
[45:26.67]Yeah, I got it.
[45:27.17]I...
[45:34.57]This guy dead?
[45:35.55]Whoa.
[45:49.43]Don't crash.
[45:50.15]Don't crash.
[45:50.71]Come on.
[45:51.75]Don't crash.
[45:53.25]There's too many body parts.
[46:03.24]Do you want any body parts?
[46:04.01]I leveled up.
[46:06.49]Alright, let's go.
[46:07.05]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[46:07.81]I'm here.
[46:09.97]Open.
[46:10.37]What do you mean locked?
[46:12.39]Oh, shit.
[46:12.75]How do I get in?
[46:13.43]Climb this.
[46:13.83]I can't climb that?
[46:24.06]Look, I'm trying to get into...
[46:32.09]Get away from me.
[46:33.03]Okay.
[46:37.82]Can I climb the side?
[46:43.50]Wait, what?
[46:49.73]Oh my god, I can climb it.
[47:00.52]5k Andy, what happened?
[47:10.00]How do I open this?
[47:12.54]Oh, was it like a bots got banned?
[47:16.68]So who's in here?
[47:21.82]I'm supposed to rescue people?
[47:34.31]Oh no, he forgot to pay his view bot service.
[47:44.27]It said 10k.
[47:44.73]Yeah, it's probably a bug.
[47:48.99]Alright, there's supposed to be survivors in here.
[47:53.60]I'm just... I can't leave.
[47:59.15]Okay, I was going to say.
[48:03.23]Oh, survivors!
[48:05.05]I found you!
[48:05.67]Is he pissing off the edge?
[48:08.82]That sounds like a good idea.
[48:35.42]but we barricaded the way through Sonnen Pass to stop the horde.
[48:40.61]Is there any other way to Grimsby?
[48:43.23]Yes, but the only other way would be through the mine and far too dangerous.
[48:48.03]Okay, I'll deal with the possessed at the bottom of the tower first.
[48:51.11]Thank you.
[48:51.63]We'll make our way to the chapel when it's safe.
[48:53.80]It's safe.
[48:54.26]We almost died back there.
[49:02.20]They chased us down the road.
[49:03.10]We barely made it.
[49:03.84]Stay safe.
[49:04.44]Okay, it's safe though.
[49:17.92]Don't fall off the edge.
[49:21.34]Oh, they're talking about these dickheads over here.
[49:29.86]You Twitch viewbot.
[49:32.31]I do look like a fighter.
[49:33.63]Don't ever do an accent.
[49:36.13]People are going to scream at you.
[49:37.79]They're going to be very mad that you just did that.
[49:43.51]Didn't I kill everything that was down here?
[49:48.69]Thanks.
[49:48.99]Good tip.
[50:03.65]If you see a possessed run.
[50:11.53]Remember you give good tips.
[50:15.04]I don't think I do.
[50:16.90]My tips are usually pretty bad.
[50:22.66]So wait, I didn't kill everything already?
[50:32.20]We still left out here.
[50:36.37]Oh, you.
[50:37.44]Okay, fine.
[50:38.06]Really?
[50:42.86]Okay.
[50:49.76]Are the nominations still up?
[50:50.92]They are.
[50:52.39]The nominations, the ability to nominate for the end of the year is going to be closing over the next couple of days.
[51:00.44]Voting will happen probably midweek up until obviously the 30th.
[51:04.01]If you have a nomination, please get it in.
[51:07.73]On the Discord, there is a New Year's Eve discussion and nominations channel.
[51:14.58]I would implore you to do so.
[51:17.32]Where do you vote?
[51:18.14]You will find a place to vote later.
[51:21.82]After the nominations have been compiled and the poll has been made.
[51:28.99]OK, so did they?
[51:31.11]Are they back at the church already?
[51:32.99]It'd be interesting if they were.
[51:35.87]Hey, I found some survivors.
[51:41.54]That's Jigsaw.
[51:45.62]I just want to put a filter on it.
[51:46.98]That's Jigsaw.
[51:48.56]Yes, they told me there are more survivors in Grimsby.
[51:51.49]But they did mention that the pass is now barricaded.
[51:53.97]And the only way to Grimsby now is through the mines.
[51:56.82]I see the Lord had locked the mines to stop the possessed from coming out.
[51:59.44]What do you suggest?
[52:01.20]I believe he fled with everyone else.
[52:03.90]But I'm sure a key to the mine would be at his home.
[52:06.90]Mesra Castle.
[52:08.86]Southeast from town on the coastal rock isle.
[52:11.22]I'm sure you'll find many useful items he left behind.
[52:14.48]Okay, I will go to the castle.
[52:19.86]Many, many have died.
[52:21.58]Make your choice.
[52:23.42]Yes.
[52:23.84]OK, where are we going from here?
[52:29.62]So we have to go.
[52:33.16]Oh shit, that's pretty.
[52:33.74]That's all the way down here.
[52:34.60]Alright, we're going to go down.
[52:39.64]If I just go straight from, I'm just going to go straight over.
[52:42.25]We can climb over some shit.
[52:43.57]He said there's useful stuff in the castle, so that'd be cool.
[52:49.75]This game is ridiculous.
[52:55.77]I can actually climb the mountain?
[53:01.19]Look, you can go anywhere you want.
[53:04.69]It's a completely open playing field.
[53:11.04]Ow.
[53:14.86]Okay, Todd.
[53:18.27]Anywhere.
[53:19.82]You can go anywhere.
[53:21.46]I can't wait to see Mesra Castle.
[53:30.50]It just works.
[53:31.48]It kind of does just work.
[53:34.82]I got Blessing, didn't I?
[53:36.62]Alright, Blessing.
[53:38.34]Level 4.
[53:39.22]Almost.
[53:40.04]One more.
[53:41.76]One more point with Strength.
[53:47.92]Okay, this looks... That's a level eight.
[53:52.66]I'm level four.
[53:54.93]And... Do I fight this guy?
[54:01.11]Oh, okay.
[54:08.20]Ugh!
[54:11.14]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[54:12.45]Run, run, run, run, run away.
[54:13.65]This guy's going to kill me.
[54:15.69]I haven't saved the game.
[54:17.21]Okay, is that level one?
[54:18.69]Why is there level eight?
[54:20.39]Please get out of my way.
[54:21.11]Please get out of my way.
[54:21.75]Please get out of my way.
[54:22.89]Please get out of my way.
[54:25.31]Oh, my God.
[54:25.80]Get out of my way.
[54:28.56]Please get out of my way.
[54:29.52]Get out.
[54:29.76]Get out.
[54:30.00]Get out.
[54:30.20]Get out.
[54:30.40]Get out.
[54:30.88]I'm dead.
[54:31.14]I'm dead.
[54:31.40]I'm dead.
[54:31.66]I'm dead.
[54:31.86]I'm dead.
[54:32.08]I want help.
[54:35.62]What's a healing potion?
[54:36.50]What's a Q?
[54:37.26]B?
[54:37.86]How do I?
[54:38.68]Wrong button.
[54:39.36]Wrong button.
[54:39.70]What do I do?
[54:41.32]What's the button?
[54:42.50]What is the button?
[54:44.46]To switch to healing potion.
[54:45.84]I don't have no idea.
[54:47.64]X?
[54:47.96]Z?
[54:50.93]Is it X?
[54:55.39]Fucking god damn it.
[55:20.31]I feel like this guy's sleep talking.
[55:22.20]That's how just odd the things he's saying are.
[55:24.70]All right.
[55:25.72]We're going to go down.
[55:26.40]I'm going to do it again.
[55:39.08]You have to 100% this game.
[55:44.71]From the trailer, there looks to be some very, very insane things that I would like to see.
[55:52.54]So, yeah, we're still here.
[55:54.22]I'm still interested.
[56:07.65]Okay.
[56:08.39]No level 8.
[56:09.39]That's good.
[56:13.63]Wait.
[56:15.38]Nice.
[56:15.76]Okay.
[56:16.66]Bread.
[56:18.00]Anything else in here?
[56:18.66]There's bread.
[56:20.48]I want to... $10 off the debt if I play something else.
[56:29.58]No thanks.
[56:30.83]You can keep that $10.
[56:31.51]You can keep it on the debt.
[56:35.03]For life.
[56:36.19]I thought that was a mace.
[56:38.91]I was like, holy shit, give me it.
[56:41.85]Can't open that?
[56:46.70]No, you're going to have to add probably like 20 zeros.
[56:54.55]Duck?
[57:01.23]Oh, god damn it.
[57:02.45]Don't run after me.
[57:03.21]Hold on.
[57:03.59]Let me just clear this.
[57:12.16]That move is really good.
[57:19.07]Take the heads off.
[57:20.05]That's the easiest way to do this.
[57:20.95]I got level 8?
[57:23.93]No.
[57:25.17]Okay.
[57:26.90]Alright.
[57:29.22]Whoops.
[57:33.54]It's Z. Okay.
[57:34.26]It's Z. Alright.
[57:36.92]This dude... This dude has some secret shit in here I gotta find.
[57:53.34]This dude... He's stuck in the chair.
[58:06.30]Bring us the Ratatouille and wipe away the dead.
[58:08.72]I'm never loading that game again.
[58:11.69]Okay, there's a shitload of people in this room.
[58:14.51]Right?
[58:14.95]I mean, come on.
[58:31.78]Okay.
[58:33.44]There's only level 1s and level 8s.
[58:35.45]I think that's kind of odd, don't you think?
[58:36.63]I thought those were bugs all over the screen.
[58:42.85]Okay, no, go up.
[58:53.66]These are peaceful villagers.
[58:56.43]Villager.
[58:59.97]Villager.
[59:00.45]There we go.
[59:01.31]That's better.
[59:07.66]Show your feet.
[59:08.48]Alright.
[59:08.84]Okay.
[59:09.20]Here we go.
[59:10.62]There they are.
[59:11.92]They're right in front of the camera.
[59:13.34]I'm holding them up.
[59:13.96]Can you... I'm rubbing them.
[59:14.96]Can you hear that?
[59:15.44]Did you see?
[59:24.25]I'm going to... Hold on.
[59:25.25]Let me put them up.
[59:25.91]I'm just going to put them on the desk, like flat on the desk.
[59:28.55]It's kind of hard to do.
[59:29.25]Okay.
[59:33.08]I can do... This is kind of hard to do, but I can do this with my feet.
[59:35.38]This is cool.
[59:35.82]Do you guys think this is cool?
[59:42.95]It's kind of hard to do that.
[59:53.68]Juggles.
[60:04.25]Lead pipe?
[60:05.07]Aww.
[60:05.15]Alright, where are these so-called secrets that this guy has?
[60:13.76]Juggles got unbanned?
[60:14.92]No, he's permanently banned from Twitch.
[60:20.84]The last I heard he was like doing a thing where he was shaking his stomach and kept on saying like kind of really really like strange shit to people.
[60:30.47]He was shaking his stomach and like talking about like just filling his body with Gatorade and like I wish that were me or something.
[60:39.25]Where's the secret item?
[60:50.70]Where is this thing?
[60:52.38]What?
[60:52.52]This is not even a castle.
[60:53.54]What the fuck is wrong with me?
[60:54.52]I'm in the wrong house.
[60:58.13]Right?
[61:06.49]Song?
[61:08.49]Oh, we got garbage links.
[61:11.17]Oh, dude.
[61:11.91]Garbage links in chat right now.
[61:14.19]I hear this fucking garbage links in chat.
[61:16.19]I ain't clicking them.
[61:22.98]Alright, there it is.
[61:23.78]Can I avoid this?
[61:25.71]Alright, I'm going to go around.
[61:28.71]I don't want to fight that guy.
[61:29.49]I can't.
[61:29.89]I'm level 4.
[61:30.25]Alright, where's that boogeyman?
[61:36.97]Watch out for the boogeyman.
[61:38.17]This is bad.
[61:39.11]This is not smart.
[61:41.09]This is not smart.
[61:42.27]Alright.
[61:45.91]This is not smart.
[62:08.51]Oh!
[62:09.01]I hear him!
[62:13.65]Get up!
[62:13.89]Get up!
[62:14.11]Get up!
[62:14.37]Get up!
[62:15.09]Get up!
[62:15.35]Get up!
[62:15.57]Get up!
[62:15.79]Get up!
[62:15.99]Get up!
[62:16.31]Holy shit!
[62:16.63]This guy scares the shit out of me!
[62:17.67]I don't know why!
[62:18.15]This guy's terrifying!
[62:20.93]Why does that scare me so much?
[62:22.28]That actually puts me in like a panic!
[62:23.92]What is that?
[62:26.70]Why is that guy here?
[62:45.40]A dude looks like a flying Dutchman.
[62:46.92]Can I get up?
[62:53.67]I don't think I can even climb up this.
[62:58.83]Oh, here we go.
[63:00.65]This'll work.
[63:02.96]What was that sound?
[63:09.87]Ow, my chest!
[63:11.61]My whole body hurts.
[63:12.73]My whole body hurts.
[63:14.75]Oh, my God.
[63:15.45]What the?
[63:17.60]Oh, my God, dude.
[63:19.56]Why?
[63:20.62]Why?
[63:20.94]There was no reason why that would ever happen.
[63:31.01]God damn it.
[63:32.03]That hurt my entire body.
[63:38.21]I climb?
[63:41.13]Dude, please.
[63:44.81]Oh, it's the stairs.
[63:48.05]Don't go through the walls.
[63:49.47]I hate this.
[63:59.49]Grenade.
[63:59.91]Nice.
[64:06.68]Horn.
[64:13.27]We're almost there.
[64:21.71]You should have the cam, Mr. Streamer.
[64:25.42]Hey, I decide when the cam goes on.
[64:29.00]I decide.
[64:29.76]It's my stream.
[64:33.08]I tell you when I put the camera on.
[64:39.29]Batman 3 is PSVR only.
[64:41.47]I still haven't gotten over it.
[64:44.53]I'm still very mad.
[64:46.92]And the last time you heard me talk about this, I have been seething for the last six weeks.
[64:53.88]It's not, it's in my brain every day.
[64:55.92]Okay.
[65:05.97]This is the manor right here.
[65:06.83]Alright, let's go.
[65:07.67]Can I climb this?
[65:09.24]No.
[65:09.36]That guy's level 8.
[65:12.46]Level 2?
[65:13.36]No.
[65:13.62]Okay, hold on.
[65:15.14]I want a different weapon.
[65:20.20]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[65:28.33]Oh, shit.
[65:28.89]Okay, hold on.
[65:32.05]Why did I... What's the point of this?
[65:38.61]Where am I?
[65:39.01]Can't get up there.
[65:52.04]I need to parkour.
[65:55.72]Alright, I'm on the roof.
[66:02.60]Now I need to get in the house.
[66:05.87]Oh, that house.
[66:08.98]Alright, I'm gonna go for it.
[66:09.62]Let's see if I can make it.
[66:18.38]The game lagged and I fell off.
[66:24.00]The game is... Alright.
[66:26.44]Every 15 feet you move, the game has to load 15 feet down the road.
[66:34.49]One, two, three.
[66:43.29]We're fine.
[66:44.23]We're fine.
[66:44.61]We're fine.
[66:44.93]We're fine.
[66:45.23]We're fine.
[66:45.45]Where's my potions?
[66:49.88]There we go.
[66:50.20]Alright, it said he had goodies in here.
[67:01.98]I hear a lot of people.
[67:04.34]But what kind of goodies does this guy have?
[67:17.98]Oh, the three crones.
[67:22.22]The three all-seeing crones, the Morai, who had been with him for a previous eternity, guarding the river of Styx in the underworld and passed through the worlds of the living and the dead, would often come to visit his spirit.
[67:35.88]Gwyn had no soul, so it could not go anywhere.
[67:41.28]And there was no one to ferry it.
[67:44.79]But he had a sort of spirit they could talk to that conveyed his disembodied state.
[67:48.95]I feel like I'm reading, I'm doing a play, and the people in the audience just fucking hate my guts and think it sucks.
[67:58.11]Tons of moaning, just groaning, booing.
[68:02.56]It's hard to read.
[68:03.30]The more I took pity on him and visited him regularly...
[68:06.41]It is important to know that the Morai are neither good nor evil.
[68:09.79]They are impartial.
[68:10.99]Typical of all the Crones.
[68:12.99]They enjoy stirring the cauldron.
[68:14.45]Yeah, intermission ended 30 minutes ago.
[68:18.14]I know that some of you are trickling it in.
[68:19.74]Some of you are shuffling in.
[68:21.82]Half of you, though, that's really annoying.
[68:24.56]Sorry the line was so long, but when the show starts, get the fuck back in here.

[69:24.03]Leave me alone!
[69:24.53]Alright, what's these?

[69:29.58]Or one-handed mastery.
[69:32.44]I mean, it's two-handed.
[69:35.16]It's two-handed.
[69:41.26]Five points in two-handed.
[69:42.54]Just fill it up.
[69:43.44]Wait, should I have done that?
[69:49.95]I don't even have a two-hander.
[69:51.05]Uh, can I hold this with two hands?

[70:07.51]Alright, I gotta go to the tower.
[70:12.10]I don't have a two-hander.
[70:12.88]I'll find one.
[70:14.14]And when I do, I'll be ready.
[70:21.98]L?
[70:22.08]Oh.
[70:22.54]Alright, I gotta go to the tower.

[70:34.95]Okay, hold on.
[70:36.41]You don't have a two-handed sword in here?
[70:38.64]Like a broadsword or something?
[70:42.35]Why?
[70:42.85]Come on.
[70:45.47]You have bullets.
[70:50.72]Who's getting in?
[70:53.14]Press T. Doesn't- Doesn't- T doesn't do anything.
[71:02.86]Alright.

[71:21.44]Alright, so I have a table knife.
[71:22.68]Two of them?
[71:26.01]Sounds like there's so many people out here.
[71:27.41]Alright, I just... I'm gonna run.
[71:29.93]I'm running.
[71:32.03]I'm gonna get out and I'm gonna run.
[71:32.93]I don't even know how to get out of here.
[71:41.14]Two-hander.
[71:41.66]Fuck.
[71:42.16]Grenade.
[71:44.21]Two-hander.
[71:44.57]Is that a two-hander?
[71:47.59]This is a two-hander.
[71:48.73]It's a two-hander.
[71:50.97]It's a two-handed rake.
[71:53.39]Where is it?
[71:58.75]Two-handed rake.
[72:00.77]Yes.
[72:08.51]Miriam, a horde is making their way down the road.
[72:10.73]We have to... Whatever.
[72:11.96]This is a note.
[72:13.42]Wait.
[72:16.36]Grab my rifle as well.
[72:18.10]I'm going to my laboratory to get ammo.
[72:19.56]Keep the door locked.
[72:20.34]Take the other woman, including that sick girl, into the study room.
[72:28.53]Where's the study room?
[72:38.77]It's under me?
[72:41.15]Door is locked.
[72:41.93]Laboratory hatch.
[72:44.63]Shit, it's upstairs?
[72:45.43]Alright, I'll go get it.
[72:46.37]It's a rifle, I want it.
[73:00.84]Study room?
[73:03.14]This is a study?
[73:08.06]Wait, why is it pointing down?
[73:11.76]Rifles are two-handed.
[73:15.66]He has the tower key.
[73:16.58]Yeah, no.
[73:17.06]That's the key to the tower.
[73:18.00]If it's... Did I go all the way up?
[73:20.11]Maybe I didn't go all the way up.
[73:21.61]I have the key.
[73:22.03]I have the key to the tower.
[73:23.09]I don't have the key to the study.
[73:28.37]There, kid.
[73:31.81]It's probably up here.
[73:32.41]Another two-handed rake?
[73:34.75]No, thanks.
[73:39.03]Key.
[73:40.94]Constance Mine Key.
[73:45.49]What's this?
[73:45.73]The last month has taken a very dark turn, okay?
[73:55.38]We'll need to drink the medicine or they will succumb to this dire consequence of eating this or being infected or something.
[74:02.60]Oh, okay.
[74:03.54]The guard turned into a brute force.
[74:05.34]I wish I didn't have travel here.
[74:06.94]This constant outbreak of violence and fighting.
[74:09.60]I heard word of another town that they hung three people for theft a fortnight ago.
[74:15.03]I've been making it at night.
[74:16.09]I've been having a lot of... I've been making potions.
[74:17.89]All right.
[74:23.39]So where's this rifle?
[74:27.84]I want the rifle, but is it?
[74:29.18]No.
[74:43.39]No.
[74:45.33]I don't know.
[74:47.01]Would it be in?
[74:47.50]Is it in the lab?
[74:48.60]I don't have a key to the lab, though.
[74:51.04]Well, hold on.
[74:51.50]Let me see.
[74:54.72]To the castle, yeah.
[74:56.86]Get the study room key from the laboratory.
[75:14.59]Alright, let's go.
[75:18.73]Out the door to the laboratory.
[75:22.33]Time to face the music.
[75:32.00]I can farm here all day.
[75:33.00]Can I throw a grenade?
[75:35.12]No grenade.
[75:38.34]I don't need it.
[75:38.74]Drink.
[75:55.10]Get out of there.
[75:55.64]Get out of there.
[75:56.04]I'm alright.
[75:56.42]I'm gonna be fine.
[75:58.56]This is a good farm.
[76:00.34]That person is so... Why are they doing so much damage?
[76:04.64]What level was that person?
[76:07.71]They're level 2.
[76:08.47]Okay, that's why.
[76:08.99]This is tomato juice hours?
[76:13.39]Okay, I'm good.
[76:15.43]Alright, I can...
[76:26.08]All right, out, out, out.
[76:27.81]Uh, where's the... I don't know.
[76:33.49]I don't know.
[76:33.79]I don't know what to do.
[76:34.63]I don't know where to go.
[76:36.33]Is it, like, underneath?
[76:37.01]I have... What's the lab key?
[76:38.27]I have a lab key.
[76:39.03]I don't know what to do with the lab.
[76:42.00]How do I get down there?
[76:50.46]Dude, back up to 10k?
[76:52.42]Oh, shit!
[76:59.53]Do I have a Molotov cocktail?
[77:07.04]Yeah, I gotta follow the marker, but the marker's like down there.
[77:10.65]Wait, what?
[77:14.97]Where is this?
[77:15.53]This doesn't feel correct.
[77:31.17]This is the mine?
[77:32.51]Oh, shit.
[77:33.41]Okay, hold on.
[77:36.41]Is this gonna hurt?
[77:41.30]Oh, fuck.
[77:46.74]The rake is gonna break.
[77:47.90]It will soon, but I'll be okay.
[77:51.63]Oh, funny scream.
[77:53.11]Thank you for that funny scream.
[77:56.45]No!
[78:04.53]There it is.
[78:04.95]Okay, cool.
[78:11.71]Lab door is locked.
[78:12.95]Laboratory.
[78:14.43]What?
[78:16.56]The door switch is being repaired.
[78:17.92]You in the top floor workshop.
[78:19.98]Use the floor hatch entrance for now.
[78:26.36]Oh shit.
[78:29.62]But what?
[78:30.94]No.
[78:31.86]Are you serious?
[78:41.38]I have so much bullshit.
[78:45.49]Where are my keys?
[78:49.49]Use a repair kit?
[78:51.23]Um... Okay.
[78:53.03]I don't know how.
[79:03.54]Oh.
[79:06.12]Did it work?
[79:08.14]Oh, I guess it worked.
[79:09.84]Okay.
[79:09.96]Okay.
[79:13.14]Where are my keys?
[79:18.36]Okay, so now what the hell am I supposed to do?
[79:19.84]I have the lab door key, right?
[79:24.79]Oh, come on, dude.
[79:26.03]I'm in the water.
[79:36.77]I'm in the water.
[79:37.15]Get out of the water, please.
[79:38.69]Get out of the water, please.
[79:39.33]Get out.
[79:39.49]I hate that guy.
[79:51.48]I can't see.
[79:52.20]Is that water?
[79:58.36]Fuck.
[79:58.82]Why did I have to come all the way down here?
[80:01.28]No.
[80:08.05]Water?
[80:13.97]Get to the beach quick.
[80:14.95]Get to the beach quick.
[80:15.89]I...
[80:21.07]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[80:26.53]I'm not in the water anymore.
[80:27.59]Get away from me.
[80:30.23]I'm not in the water anymore.
[80:31.43]Get away from me, please.
[80:46.15]Yeah.
[80:53.99]He speaks backwards.
[80:54.93]Okay, now I gotta go.
[80:59.59]Where the hell am I?
[81:00.59]It's too dark.
[81:01.27]I can't see anything.
[81:01.99]Alright, bang a left.
[81:03.89]I'm just running around with a rake.
[81:14.80]Do I have pants on?
[81:16.00]I don't even know if I have pants on.
[81:17.97]Alright, straight.
[81:27.75]Oh no.
[81:32.64]Level 8.
[81:33.70]Level 8.
[81:34.40]Level 8.
[81:34.82]Level 8.
[81:35.24]Please get away from me.
[81:36.26]Get off the bridge.
[81:38.95]I have to go up here.
[81:40.23]Please get me in.
[81:41.81]Oh fuck.
[81:47.55]Get away from me.
[81:48.25]Okay.
[81:48.53]Okay.
[82:00.67]Alright, open this dumb door.
[82:09.37]It's just Morty, but not high-pitched.
[82:16.46]Fucking Morty.
[82:20.96]This dude does a real Morty when he's scared.
[82:23.52]Alright, hold on.
[82:24.26]I leveled up.
[82:27.48]What can I do?
[82:34.79]Can I put it into this?
[82:35.91]One-handed or... This is as far as it can go.
[82:40.13]Endurance?
[82:43.41]Dark Arts.
[82:44.05]I don't think I can... Allows instantaneous travel to previously visited zones.
[82:47.12]I can't even click it.
[82:50.80]I need a certain consumable.
[82:52.86]Agility?
[82:59.64]And it has the ability to vault over short objects.
[83:01.61]Yeah, I mean, we kind of have to spread out a little.
[83:04.90]Or I could do this one too.
[83:07.78]Nope.
[83:07.94]Maybe I'll do Endurance.
[83:15.44]Let's do Endurance.
[83:18.45]I have one point.
[83:19.13]Let's see.
[83:21.41]Blessings can regenerate in combat or decrease movement-based stamina costs.
[83:28.29]Blessings can regenerate in combat, I think.
[83:31.67]Yeah.
[83:35.14]Alright, cool.
[83:36.18]We're looking alright.
[83:36.74]Alright, now I gotta just go in this guy's stupid secret lab bullshit thing.
[83:48.59]What?
[83:48.79]I thought that was a repair kit.
[83:52.71]Are you serious?
[83:58.09]Do I actually have to go?
[83:59.17]Alright, now where the hell is this study?
[84:12.48]Isn't there like a door somewhere?
[84:13.64]For the marker?
[84:15.83]Yeah, I don't see a marker.
[84:16.73]You guys see a marker?
[84:20.03]I don't see one.
[84:38.32]Thank God it's almost light out.
[84:40.99]Is it down?
[84:43.62]Uh, it might be done.
[84:46.12]Thank you for the funny stream.
[84:47.67]It's absolutely my pleasure.
[84:49.85]I'm still getting sick.
[84:51.81]Let me, I'll fix that.
[84:54.81]That was better.
[85:01.29]Still getting over that, uh, cold I had, so.
[85:06.56]Where's this marker?
[85:14.12]How do you make that noise?
[85:15.10]Well, it's from lying in the bathtub for like an hour and just sitting and practicing it over and over again.
[85:23.27]Can I already get this?
[85:23.97]Anything's one of his hobbies?
[85:38.20]Yes, it is.
[85:38.66]I love taking baths.
[85:39.62]It's like one of my favorite things in the world.
[85:46.91]Where's this goddamn marker?
[85:50.21]That's a tower room up there, isn't it?
[85:58.77]I would classify this as a tower.
[86:01.51]Get the fuck out of my camera.
[86:07.66]There it is.
[86:08.10]Okay.
[86:09.74]What's in here?
[86:20.34]Oh shit, alright, what is it?
[86:23.08]Power room.
[86:29.53]There's nothing in here.
[86:44.40]Power!
[86:45.38]Why'd you just say that?
[86:47.70]Power!
[86:48.36]Unlimited power!
[86:50.69]Total corruption!
[86:51.93]Total power!
[86:52.91]Why are you saying that?
[86:53.67]Why'd you do that?
[86:54.99]Tell me, explain to me why you did that.
[86:56.76]I wanna know.
[86:57.42]Now why would you do something like that?
[86:59.28]Now why would you do something like that?
[87:14.87]There's nothing here.
[87:20.04]That was stupid.
[87:21.41]Can I track the quest somehow?
[87:25.47]Journal.
[87:26.63]Investigate the laboratory.
[87:27.77]Complete.
[87:28.39]Get the study room key from the laboratory.
[87:32.05]What?
[87:33.79]Investigate the laboratory.
[87:35.39]Get the study room key from the laboratory.
[87:41.51]Where's the laboratory?
[87:46.52]Go back to the room?
[87:49.52]Look up.
[87:55.73]What do you mean look up?
[87:56.63]What is it?
[87:57.21]Look up.
[87:58.97]You missed a legendary chest.
[88:01.39]It's in here.
[88:02.35]I got to go back in this house.
[88:03.37]Hold on.
[88:16.58]Bottom floor of the house.
[88:17.52]There's a hatch.
[88:18.28]Okay.
[88:20.15]Yeah, but I couldn't open it, but it is there.
[88:24.46]Just let me in the damn house, please.
[88:27.26]Look, all of you.
[88:36.62]Get away!
[88:38.84]This is a level fucking seven.
[88:40.72]Level seven, don't like it.
[88:47.03]Level seven, get away from me.
[88:56.83]So, door is locked.
[88:58.11]What do you mean door is locked?
[89:00.59]This is the study!
[89:02.23]Don't I have the key to the study?
[89:05.45]What?
[89:05.69]I have to go in the laboratory first.
[89:18.65]Laboratory!
[89:20.27]Door is locked!
[89:21.07]Laboratory hatch is locked!
[89:25.45]What the- What the fuck?

[89:30.83]Wait a second, hold on.
[89:33.40]This is the door to the study that is locked, but I- I'm in it now.
[89:41.18]I can't do it- I can't interact with this.
[89:43.04]Do I have to go back all the way down?
[89:49.91]Grab my rifle.
[89:50.71]The horde is making their way down the road.
[89:53.01]We haven't much time.
[89:53.63]Take the other woman, including that sick girl, into the study room.
[90:07.90]Isn't that the same door?
[90:15.61]Okay.
[90:15.93]I'm going to my laboratory to get ammo.
[90:18.75]Keep the door locked.
[90:21.21]So I have to switch now.
[90:22.25]Now I go down where the thing was.
[90:28.59]Well, I don't have a marker anymore.
[90:34.53]Oh my god.
[90:35.25]What the fuck?
[90:37.27]I have to switch.
[90:37.81]Okay, so I use it outside where the mine was, right?
[90:46.24]I think this is bugged.
[90:57.09]I have the switch for the... I don't understand.
[91:00.23]How come it's not tracking anything?
[91:05.88]You're actually pretending.
[91:07.16]I have no idea what's happening.
[91:10.16]He's not pretending.
[91:10.80]The game sucks.
[91:11.82]Oh.
[91:13.54]I don't know what's going on.
[91:16.55]I'm gonna go try to go to the mine I don't have a marker on my map anymore oh my fucking god please holy shit I killed everybody
[91:49.90]Alright, so I have to go back to the ledge and go where the mine was to open the door with- I guess I have to switch now?
[92:02.98]Yeah, well how come it's not on the map?
[92:04.14]He's like, I remember where the fuck that is?
[92:23.78]Select the quest.
[92:26.18]Active quests.
[92:28.46]The study room and the mine key.
[92:30.28]I mean, but it's not showing anything.
[92:40.46]Oh, I'm just going to go down here.
[92:41.40]Am I going the right way though?
[92:43.69]I don't remember being down here.
[92:58.72]The door is locked.
[93:04.60]Where's my marker?
[93:06.92]Where's my marker?
[93:08.94]Where's my... There was no marker there.
[93:10.82]I don't want to hear it.
[93:12.04]There was no marker here.
[93:14.32]I don't want to hear it.
[93:15.55]I don't want to hear it.
[93:16.11]There's no marker.
[93:27.04]What?
[93:27.28]Who is this guy?
[93:28.20]Level 3 Knight?
[93:35.07]Get away from me.
[93:35.95]I'm going to throw grenades at him.
[93:39.49]God damn it.
[93:47.29]No.
[93:57.42]I can't knock him over.
[94:29.69]Can I take his weapon?
[94:31.39]That's a huge two-headed sword.
[94:32.33]Can I take it?
[94:35.91]I can't take the weapon.
[94:36.77]I was trying to blow him up, but that explosion radius is so small.
[94:47.42]That's like a firecracker.
[94:50.74]My God.
[94:51.18]Let me out of the room.
[95:14.18]at you.
[95:15.66]Bastard.
[95:17.64]Okay, don't lock the door behind me because there might be another one.
[95:30.32]You're just slapping a guy with a rake.
[95:31.86]Yeah, well, it's two handed, so okay.
[95:34.60]Study room key.
[95:36.62]Oh my God.
[95:37.62]Do I have to actually go back to the fucking study?
[95:43.60]Oh shit.
[95:50.73]How do I get up there?
[95:55.65]Nothing up there.
[95:59.99]Get the gun.
[96:08.39]Hold on.
[96:08.79]Hold on.
[96:12.08]Hold on a second.
[96:14.78]I'm going to get the gun.
[96:15.48]Just wait.
[96:19.00]Looking around for lore.
[96:19.86]I'm just hold on looking for lore.
[96:21.02]I want to build a raid shit.
[96:25.86]No, I'm looking to raid if there's anything around.
[96:45.03]Where's the gun?
[96:58.25]My, wait, everyone, you guys are freaking me out.
[97:00.41]Is there a garden?
[97:03.59]Everybody's freaking me out.
[97:08.51]It's on the bed.
[97:09.21]It's in the study.
[97:09.97]Yeah, you guys are wrong.
[97:13.00]Okay, you guys are freaking me out.
[97:14.48]Why is everybody freaking me out?
[97:15.48]All right, study room.
[97:16.80]Finally, look.

[97:54.64]Come on, man.
[98:04.23]Hey, can I climb?
[98:05.49]No.
[98:05.95]Just go the right way.
[98:18.84]Wait, the boogeyman is going to get this guy, right?
[98:21.64]Where did you... The body parts kind of fall off really easily, I've noticed.
[98:38.55]Okay, going in the study.
[98:39.45]We're going to get the gun in the study.
[98:44.77]And I'm going to use the gun to shoot someone in the head.
[98:52.23]Here we go.
[98:52.55]Tell us the backup game.
[98:56.23]No.
[98:56.39]No, because I'm going to play the backup game.
[98:58.97]I'm into this.
[98:59.61]I'm playing this for a while.
[99:02.01]You'll know what the backup game is soon enough this week.
[99:04.86]I'll tell you what the plan is though.

[99:07.60]I have some stuff I got to take care of over the next couple of days.
[99:09.78]So there'll be no streams over the next couple of days.

[102:05.37]Watch out.
[102:05.83]Don't be an idiot.
[102:08.47]Okay, straight up this road and then left.
[102:09.65]I'm gonna try my absolute hardest to do a Peter Griffin.
[102:17.18]I'll try.
[102:21.32]Hey.
[102:21.86]Hold on.
[102:22.26]I'll get it.
[102:23.28]Hey.
[102:26.10]I can probably do it pretty well.
[102:27.30]I mean, it's like Boston accent.
[102:28.66]You know what I mean?
[102:29.16]Like, they're in Rhode Island.
[102:35.23]What are you talking about, Lois?
[102:39.37]Hey, Lois.
[102:40.60]You remember the time that me and Stewie went to the... Wait, who are these people?
[102:45.92]Oh, wait.
[102:46.26]These are survivors.
[102:46.94]I'm bringing them back to the church.
[102:48.26]This is just Bloodborne.
[102:52.13]Okay, Peter.
[102:53.73]I have the key.
[102:56.31]Good.
[102:56.57]Head to the mine's main entrance and make your way through.
[102:58.63]Didn't I do that?
[103:01.84]I've noticed lights coming from the mine storage on the ridge.
[103:04.84]Can you check for survivors?
[103:13.70]Into the depths.
[103:15.72]Can I sell?
[103:24.16]Thanks for clearing the way.
[103:26.38]Thank you for helping us.
[103:29.07]We decided we're going to stay here.
[103:30.41]Yep.
[103:32.18]Oh.
[104:03.36]Um, okay.
[104:04.20]I wanna... I don't give a shit about your supplies.
[104:05.92]I wanna do this.
[104:14.38]Now we go out of here.
[104:15.56]Okay.
[104:18.11]Talk in the Peter voice.
[104:19.57]For how long?
[104:23.37]How long do I have to do that for?
[104:29.79]You want me just to do like a pretend like Peter Griffin let's play?
[104:33.75]Like, is this like 2009 on YouTube?
[104:38.26]Do you want me to do that?
[104:42.12]Am I going to do it like a Peter Griffin plays Skyrim?
[104:54.03]Alright, I'm going to try.
[104:55.03]Let's see what I can do.
[104:59.33]I'm going to try so hard.
[105:00.17]I'm going to try not to laugh and fuck it up.
[105:01.65]All right.
[105:06.35]Okay.
[105:08.30]So we got some bad guys here.
[105:10.00]Oh, I got to go this way around the bad guys.
[105:16.36]Hopefully there's something in the shed I can use.
[105:22.72]No, no, no.
[105:25.32]Kind of reminds me of when I fought the chicken.
[105:37.22]Ah, you look like Lois.
[105:42.08]I am Peter.
[105:43.30]My name is Peter.
[105:44.66]I'm killing zombies.
[105:46.01]My name is Peter.
[105:55.01]Fucking game crashed.
[105:56.85]Whatever, it's over.
[106:02.85]Oh, by the way, I'm going to make that I'm going to make like 60 of those videos.
[106:09.70]OK, where we going?
[106:16.36]Whoa.
[106:22.05]You should bring that back.
[106:26.87]I remember that was so... That's so old.
[106:28.71]That's so long ago.
[106:29.97]That's like 2010 or something.
[106:32.77]2009, 2011.
[106:32.87]Hold on.
[106:41.72]Hold on.
[106:43.20]What's this?
[106:45.26]A rusty sword.
[106:46.30]No, thank you.
[106:48.36]Beta.
[106:51.76]Do Stewie Griffin playing Black Ops 2.
[106:53.54]Hahaha.
[106:57.75]Alright.
[106:58.95]It exists already.
[106:59.91]I don't have to do that.
[107:01.67]If you just type into YouTube like Stewie Griffin plays X, you're gonna get like a thousand videos.
[107:09.32]I don't even have to do this.
[107:10.30]They already exist.
[107:12.80]I say, Brian.
[107:14.40]This fool thinks he can fire at me?
[107:17.42]It's definitely there.
[107:18.40]Like, I don't have to even do it.
[107:24.57]Wait, I didn't go up.
[107:25.21]Yes, I did.
[107:31.32]Okay, I need to go to... I'm going the wrong way.
[107:37.30]Stewie was awful.
[107:38.90]I say, Brian.
[107:40.96]Any idea?
[107:42.14]Look, I've been sick.
[107:43.32]You can't blame somebody else.
[107:44.50]I'm going the wrong way.
[107:48.98]Look, everybody can do Stewie Griffin for the first word.
[107:53.18]I say, Brian.
[107:56.45]That's it.
[107:58.55]Nobody else... You can do that much, right?
[108:11.08]Stewie is playing Black Ops.
[108:20.39]I gotta go this way.
[108:21.87]I climb this.
[108:33.90]I don't... Why are you not allowed in the water?
[108:38.12]Anybody else find that strange?
[108:39.98]There has to be a reason why.
[108:42.78]When the player character goes into the water, there's probably like a memory leak that happens in like a minute that they have to try to avoid somehow.
[109:01.97]I have to fight.
[109:02.79]I can't swing in the water.
[109:03.79]I can't fight the zombie.
[109:04.67]Alright, we're going the right way across the river.
[109:09.54]I can't even swing my sword.
[109:11.36]I'm sorry, rake.
[109:25.29]Persistent bodies.
[109:26.15]It's kind of pog.
[109:28.67]That's kind of a pog moment.
[109:37.46]Unfair.
[109:41.07]Okay, cool.
[109:41.95]Let's keep going.
[109:42.75]Over here, the mine.
[109:43.79]God damn it.
[109:59.02]All right, get over here.
[110:02.39]I'm going to fucking hit.
[110:03.35]Do I have any grenades?
[110:05.19]I have a Molotov cocktail.
[110:06.23]I'm going to throw it into the water.
[110:09.95]Where is he?
[110:17.04]There he is.
[110:17.30]There he is.
[110:17.56]There he is.
[110:17.88]Alright, come here.
[110:18.26]Come here.
[110:18.72]Come here.
[110:19.00]Come here.
[110:19.87]Come here.
[110:21.19]Come here.
[110:33.64]I shoot him.
[110:34.90]If I could shoot him in the head, I'm going to laugh so hard.
[110:43.90]Come here, dude.
[110:46.08]I'm gonna kill this motherfucker.
[111:05.51]All right.
[111:05.85]All right.
[111:06.07]Come on.
[111:06.35]Come on over.
[111:08.51]Whoa!
[111:09.25]That's... Relax.
[111:15.31]I can't shoot him.
[111:17.21]That was so overreact.
[111:18.55]That was an overreaction.
[111:20.03]That was the most extreme overreaction.
[111:22.59]Holy Jesus Christ.
[111:27.56]Come here.
[111:27.88]Don't move.
[111:28.20]Don't move.
[111:28.58]Don't move.
[111:28.92]Don't move.
[111:29.26]Don't move.
[111:30.24]This is so hard.
[111:31.02]Okay, if I miss this shot, I add 50 billion dollars to the debt.
[111:34.56]Okay.
[111:48.53]Now?
[111:49.39]Thank God I don't have to do it.
[111:51.05]Thank God.
[111:51.63]What is the armor on?
[111:58.99]Um.
[112:02.90]I didn't miss.
[112:03.50]It hit him right in the head.
[112:16.03]Oh my god damn it man.
[112:17.99]What the fuck is happening right now?
[112:25.49]You hit the door?
[112:26.29]I did not hit the fucking door.
[112:40.43]Whoa, okay.
[112:41.11]He figured it out.
[112:41.77]He figured it out.
[112:42.31]He figured it out.
[112:43.47]He figured it out.
[112:44.27]He figured it out.
[112:44.87]It's okay.
[112:45.91]Just... I'm just like a monkey.
[112:56.49]I'm like a monkey that's gotten out of a cage.
[113:05.96]Get away from me, you little shit.
[113:21.36]No, don't eat those tomatoes.
[113:24.82]Like in every single movie where the monkey is the main character, he's eating the food.

[114:18.44]Okay.
[114:18.62]That was weird.
[114:21.56]Wait, that doesn't happen in those movies?
[114:29.92]You can't add 50 billion.
[114:31.40]I hit him in the head.
[114:32.16]It's just the bullets are made out of like fucking cardboard.
[114:39.67]I did not hit the door.
[114:40.89]I did not hit the door.
[114:43.16]I did not hit the door.
[114:44.28]No, I didn't.
[114:45.52]I hit him right in the head.
[114:48.38]It hit him directly in his head.
[114:51.66]I even shot twice and it hit him in the head.
[114:53.84]He's wearing armor.
[114:54.76]I can't pierce the armor with the bullets.
[115:00.63]No, this doesn't count.
[115:01.75]It doesn't count.
[115:07.07]No.
[115:08.23]It doesn't count.
[115:13.22]How does it hit the door?
[115:15.94]Explain how I hit him, how I miss him.

[117:11.70]It's not.
[117:12.30]It is impossible.
[117:13.34]That's impossible.
[117:14.94]You understand?
[117:31.36]God damn it.
[117:34.23]No experience gain.
[117:35.39]Yeah, I have to kill something to get experience gain.
[117:37.13]You don't just get it for shooting things.
[117:46.01]Double or nothing.
[117:46.91]What do you mean double or nothing?
[117:49.49]You want me to bet a hundred billion dollars to the debt that I can make the next shot with the rifle?
[117:54.41]Sure.
[117:55.56]It's this guy.
[117:56.34]Oh, holy shit.

[118:02.38]All right, it's this guy right here.
[118:03.54]I just have to hit him.
[118:04.56]I just have to hit him.
[118:05.46]It doesn't matter where.
[118:06.84]I have to damage this guy with the gun.
[118:12.91]Okay, like I said, I just have to damage this guy with the gun.
[118:16.53]It's not my next shot, not my next move.
[118:18.77]I just have to hit him with the gun.
[118:20.71]So I'm going to get rid of this person.
[118:21.93]I'm going to get rid of this lady.
[118:26.13]Okay, I just have to shoot him with the gun.
[118:28.80]That's it.
[118:33.38]I win.
[118:33.60]Okay.
[118:34.90]My heart was just racing right there.
[118:43.52]Oh, my chat.
[118:43.94]I gotta pop my chat out.
[118:44.79]This is like broken.
[118:45.73]No deal.
[118:54.27]No deal.
[118:55.57]Whatever.
[118:56.92]That was a deal.
[118:57.44]I made it.
[118:57.76]How do you turn night mode on?
[119:00.70]On Twitch?
[119:04.48]Where's knight mode?
[119:05.52]How do you turn it on?
[119:09.07]Dark mode.
[119:09.43]Okay, there it is.
[119:09.93]Okay, I got it.
[119:16.13]Okay, I just gotta go into the entrance here.
[119:17.63]The mine.
[119:19.25]With my two-hander.
[119:30.06]Shoot another knight.
[119:32.79]Maybe eventually I will, but not right now.
[119:38.77]And why did I not just pick the knife with a one-hander?
[119:45.08]This is so much better than using a two-hander.
[119:49.90]Why would I have ever done that?
[119:56.22]Alright, survivors in here.
[120:00.50]Is it... Cutscene?
[120:03.34]Is there a cutscene?
[120:04.70]No way.
[120:14.33]I'm going to be able to... Wait, is that the... That's the water guy.
[120:20.89]Wait.
[120:31.62]He's just reading like the back of a Denny's menu and they reversed it.
[120:38.05]You must put me together so I may be whole again.
[121:01.37]There are towers.
[121:02.23]Each contain a piece of me.
[121:07.64]You must enter these towers and collect my pieces.
[121:12.40]beautiful like diamonds in the sky right stop what
[121:40.69]I didn't pay attention to the last part.
[121:43.03]Go forth and be wary of temptations.
[121:44.73]Was the snake gonna show up and feed me an apple?
[121:56.44]No, I... Okay.
[121:59.76]Welcome to the mine.
[122:00.68]That was pretty abrupt.
[122:10.01]Yeah, cut.
[122:10.63]Alright, now the actors are going to eat lunch.
[122:15.33]Nice job, Bob.
[122:16.35]You really gave it.
[122:16.93]You gave it.
[122:17.23]When you talked about the two pieces and shit, that was ad-libbed.
[122:19.48]I can't even fucking believe that, man.
[122:22.88]It's my fucking turn at the food truck, Bob.
[122:29.73]Man, he's such a good actor.
[122:32.34]To pieces of me.
[122:33.48]Two pieces of me.
[122:34.44]They didn't even write that.
[122:36.04]Un-fucking-believable.
[122:37.85]God, I wish I was as good as he was.
[122:40.23]Just read my lines.
[122:41.27]I can't come up with new shit on the spot.
[122:43.23]I gotta read them better than he can read his scripted lines, though.
[122:56.88]How much damage does this do?
[122:59.02]That was just one word.
[123:00.22]I said a whole sentence, but it was a single word.
[123:03.58]How much does that change the resistance?
[123:15.24]Game runs so much better indoors.
[123:27.91]Okay, into the mine again.
[123:34.59]I hear a lot of noise.
[123:42.06]Make me whole again.
[123:51.05]Look out!
[123:56.84]This is just how everybody plays Dark Souls when they play a dagger build.
[124:07.45]It takes forever to kill anything.
[124:08.81]You just spam.
[124:10.05]You just R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1, R1.
[124:14.94]Or try to dodge around and stab in the back.
[124:18.44]It always seems like a fun thing to do at first.
[124:21.47]Oh, no, I'm going to do a dagger build in Dark Souls.
[124:24.21]And then you see what I just did on screen.
[124:26.34]And you're like, no, no, I'm going back to strength.
[124:29.66]This is stupid.
[124:32.48]When you do eight damage to the first boss in Dark Souls per swing with the dagger, you're like, no, thanks.
[124:36.70]I don't want to do this anymore.
[124:37.94]This is fucking stupid.
[124:45.43]Pretty damn good in this game.
[125:00.00]I actually like the knife.
[125:01.02]I wish I could do two.
[125:03.52]Why can't I do dual welding knives and just slash them side by side like crazy?
[125:08.51]Must be a long road.
[125:11.57]That's loud, though.
[125:12.45]It hurts.
[125:12.81]Okay, this way.
[125:14.33]I'm going to level up.
[125:18.67]I will.
[125:21.74]I'm in the hay?
[125:28.81]Oh.
[125:30.91]No.
[125:37.51]Next frame, please.
[125:38.79]All right, warm us out.
[125:39.43]Hold on.
[125:39.87]Level up.
[125:42.99]All right.
[125:43.87]I got two points.
[125:48.68]One-handed mastery.
[125:49.52]Yeah, probably.
[125:50.28]And then rage charge.
[125:54.96]Oh, shit.
[125:56.76]I gotta... What's this?
[125:57.38]What's coming up next?
[125:58.68]Two-handed impact.
[126:00.58]Yeah, I gotta get rage charge, man.
[126:04.54]This is just one point?
[126:05.33]Okay.
[126:05.77]Well, should I put... Should I just do... Uh... Man, I'm gonna do one-handed as well.
[126:10.89]Whatever.
[126:11.33]Who cares?
[126:11.69]Dark arts?
[126:14.60]I can't do dark arts.
[126:15.28]I don't have enough of the... I don't have any of that currency.
[126:17.26]Whatever it is.
[126:26.76]Dark farts.
[126:30.34]I hope I hope you get in trouble in this chat.
[126:32.22]I hope you got like I hope you actually got in trouble.
[126:35.59]No.
[126:36.91]One of the mods is just like OK dude.
[126:40.27]On.
[126:56.24]This is too good.
[126:56.94]It's too good of a weapon.
[126:58.28]We need more cooldown on this thing.
[127:02.14]What are you in here?
[127:03.82]Oh shit.
[127:06.54]What am I going to do?
[127:12.69]What the fuck?
[127:15.53]Durability?
[127:16.09]I have a repair.
[127:17.53]I can repair it.
[127:24.93]What's next?
[127:25.47]Okay, keep going.
[127:30.83]I got banned from your channel for saying streamer smells like dog shitty.
[127:40.08]Oh.
[127:40.60]Well, uh... Okay.
[127:46.87]Dog shitty.
[127:54.46]I kind of just feel like I have one of those chunk destroyers in Minecraft.
[127:59.46]Like I can just walk forward and just... Door is locked.
[128:11.36]Open it.
[128:16.84]Minecraft gamer minus two.
[128:20.46]Hey.
[128:21.12]What's...
[128:22.59]You almost had a chance to do it.
[128:24.06]You had a really good chance to have that via death.
[128:27.12]Very close.
[128:28.40]Sorry.
[128:30.08]Then here's the best part.
[128:31.20]Tons of you, just the second you saw my pixel go over the railing, were like, FALL JOKE!
[128:36.20]OH MY GOD!
[128:36.74]FUCKING IDIOT!
[128:37.62]And it didn't happen.
[128:38.34]And now you can't delete that comment.
[128:40.32]It's there forever.
[128:40.90]Okay.
[128:51.37]I need to get in here.
[128:55.53]Okay, that's fine.
[128:56.39]I'll do it.
[128:56.79]Find the mine entrance and make your way through.
[129:09.38]Investigate the sounds?
[129:14.10]Is this you making that sound?
[129:22.37]Thank God you came along when you did.
[129:24.85]I've been trapped here for months.
[129:27.23]How did you survive?
[129:28.07]There is the storage house of the mine.
[129:32.11]It has food and supplies, but there is almost none left now.
[129:35.57]I haven't slept much because, well, you know, you can hear.
[129:37.99]Is it safe for them to all be down there?
[129:42.06]I locked the door.
[129:42.96]Many of them were my friends.
[129:45.14]I'm sorry, Peter.
[129:46.78]The chaplain in Strathshire sent me to help you.
[129:51.81]I wasn't sure if anyone was left down there.
[129:53.69]Is it safe to get there?
[129:55.69]Mine isn't safe and the nearest exits are caved in.
[129:59.07]Well, I have explosives in a crate.
[130:01.27]It's downstairs.
[130:03.31]You got the key?
[130:04.63]Here it is.
[130:05.63]Before you clear the north entrance, could you open up the side for me first?
[130:09.51]I'll make my way to Peter when it's safe.
[130:12.59]I will.
[130:13.45]When you hear the second explosion, you'll know I've cleared both ways.
[130:16.75]It should be safe enough to get back.
[130:18.37]Be careful.
[130:19.96]I would have been done for if you hadn't come along.
[130:21.66]Thanks again.
[130:22.12]I hope you find more people in Grimsby.
[130:25.31]I can't wait to get out of here.
[130:39.54]Imagine you see someone coming around the corner going like this.
[130:41.48]It's like, oh shit, I'm dead.
[130:50.93]Yeah, hey!
[130:54.30]I'm coming to help you, man.
[130:54.94]Where were those explosives again?
[130:58.00]Downstairs, you said, right?
[131:07.88]That guy looks like Glue Man.
[131:14.39]Come on, get me in there.
[131:15.11]What the fuck?
[131:19.19]Get me in there.
[131:25.01]Never mind.
[131:25.51]Hold on.
[131:26.02]I have to have a... Hold on.
[131:27.50]Mm.
[131:58.53]Okay.
[132:00.19]That's blood.
[132:04.21]Got the explosives.
[132:08.19]Microwaving popcorn.
[132:15.34]That's explosives?
[132:16.38]That's like a bag of Halloween candy.
[132:18.84]What are you talking about?
[132:19.66]There's a bomb in there?
[132:21.84]I'm going up.
[132:22.28]I'm going to blow up the
[132:29.13]Okay.
[132:30.11]Blow up the mine.
[132:49.70]And you heard the second explosion.
[132:50.94]Okay.
[132:59.71]What does it want me to put the bomb?
[133:11.60]Knife is almost broken.
[133:12.70]Oh shit.
[133:13.08]It is.
[133:13.44]Well, I'll repair it.
[133:17.38]Repair kit.
[133:22.49]Uh, kitchen knife.
[133:25.85]We're good.
[133:41.09]How much further do I have to go?
[133:42.15]Oh shit, alright.
[133:54.18]Explosion 1.
[133:54.60]How do I blow it up?
[133:57.96]Wow!
[133:58.42]Okay, now I need... Explosion 2 is up this way.
[134:20.14]Get over here.
[134:24.42]Explosion 2 coming up.
[134:28.48]And then he's gonna go back to that church.
[134:40.67]Sick.
[134:42.89]Alright, I did it.
[134:43.83]He gets to leave.
[134:46.25]Journey to Grimsby.
[134:49.07]Going to... Ooh, going to Grimsby.
[134:51.00]This is pretty sick.
[134:52.68]This is pretty sick.
[134:55.72]Human?
[134:57.62]No.
[134:57.96]Is that a human?
[135:00.94]No.
[135:01.68]No, it's not a human.
[135:02.38]Is it a human?
[135:03.36]I think it's level 10.
[135:04.86]Well, I'm completely safe.
[135:06.77]Don't worry.
[135:07.11]Okay.
[135:20.63]I wasn't- I mean, it was not that safe, but it was still okay.
[135:28.02]Okay, we gotta go to Grimsby.
[135:29.40]It's like a major town.
[135:30.34]Wait, there's a- hold on, there's a house over here.
[135:46.56]Remember, you're underleveled.
[135:47.42]You got to farm some more souls.
[135:49.86]I'll be okay in a minute.
[135:57.41]I forgot I even had that move.
[136:01.95]Why do I even do that when I can just do this?
[136:15.89]We got it.
[136:18.91]Any weapons?
[136:20.47]Any armor?
[136:21.55]What do you got for me in here?
[136:22.59]Something good, right?
[136:23.57]In the chest.
[136:26.19]Shitty spawn.
[136:27.49]Shitty spawn rate.
[136:28.31]Really?
[136:28.57]There's nothing in here?
[136:31.01]Stupid.
[136:32.25]What's the point of even having this?
[136:33.87]Why is this even here?
[136:35.97]They added the 50 billion.
[136:37.33]No, they didn't.
[136:38.67]Take it off.
[136:40.33]Take that off.
[136:40.76]That's not real.
[136:42.88]I had the crosshair on his head and it was directly shooting him in the head.
[136:47.46]No, you can take that off.
[136:48.26]That's not real.
[136:49.44]I hit him in the head.
[136:50.08]You saw the sparks.
[136:51.76]You saw the sparks come up.
[136:55.74]Oh, I ain't going that way.
[136:56.68]I went up high into the mountain here.
[137:09.41]I'm going to get a pretty good view.
[137:10.54]This might be actually pretty cool.
[137:24.27]A full HP.
[137:25.11]Yeah, I'm good.
[137:25.55]Okay.
[137:28.77]Well, he's a hide knight.
[137:40.08]Shoot him.
[137:43.04]I can't hurt him.
[137:48.41]Shoot him.
[137:48.91]Shoot.
[137:49.29]Shoot him.
[138:01.38]It's doing damage.
[138:02.14]Yeah, but it was... The other guy had a weird force field around him.
[138:05.95]I... I don't think any damage went down when I just hit him in the head.
[138:21.10]It did.
[138:30.11]No fucking way, dude.
[138:33.59]No way.
[138:34.23]I shot him right in the head.
[138:37.11]He should be right in the face.
[138:52.10]All right, just keep raking him.
[138:54.70]All right, fuck you, dude.
[138:56.46]Stop.
[139:06.89]Alright dive That was that was like an Andy toys are here thing or whatever toys Andy's here That was really really good.

[141:35.15]No, this is Alderman Gibbons, another survivor.
[141:38.35]I was marooned here, but I made my way up from Strathsire.
[141:42.11]That's unfortunate.
[141:43.45]I heard something plagued the waters before this all went down.
[141:46.89]I ran into Ira and Derek.
[141:49.49]They're staying with Chaplain Peter after they were chased by a horde.
[141:53.88]Glad to hear they're okay.
[141:54.82]We got worried after not hearing from them, but we're still in need of supplies.
[141:58.74]There are many supplies for miles except for the storage house, of course.
[142:02.54]Okay, I'll clear them out.
[142:03.92]I can handle it.

[144:50.73]Okay, get up.
[144:52.75]Get up, get up.

[145:06.22]Okay.
[145:11.22]I thought it was like, wait a minute.

[145:22.87]Hold on a second.
[145:24.79]So that means that'll work on all... Okay, that's going to work on like the thousands of them that are down there.
[145:36.48]Can I just farm an insane amount of experience?
[145:40.82]If I kill like 5,000 people with that windmill, I'm going to level up like eight times.
[145:56.61]Okay.
[145:56.89]Let's slow- Okay, slow this down.
[146:02.39]Pole cancelled?
[146:03.19]Pole is botted.
[146:04.43]There's no pole.
[146:05.05]Alright, let's see if I can do this.
[146:15.67]Do I have to tag them first?
[146:19.09]Holy shit, it actually does work.
[146:20.61]Okay, hold on.
[146:21.05]Wait, wait, wait.

[146:25.19]Watch out.
[146:25.55]Don't get hit by it.
[146:31.38]There's too many people.
[146:33.17]There's too many people.
[146:34.07]Alright, I'm gonna hide up here.
[146:43.28]Where are they going?
[146:45.36]Why are they going this way?
[146:59.82]Did I crowd?
[147:02.68]I'm not getting any EXP.
[147:04.52]Oh shit, I have to tag them.
[147:13.98]What was I doing?
[147:14.76]What was I doing that for again?

[162:01.01]There's a lot of barrels in this game.
[162:04.87]Which one should I go for?
[162:09.25]Right.
[162:09.69]One that's against the house.
[162:40.74]Where you killed them.
[163:02.37]Where the fucking swords?
[163:15.21]Let's go.
[163:15.97]Let's go.
[163:16.33]You see that one?
[163:17.69]Let's go.
[163:18.29]Look at that.
[163:19.25]Let's go.
[163:21.23]Yeah.
[163:30.76]I'm not going that way.
[163:37.02]Can you please play Lego Star Wars?
[163:38.40]This game is too violent.
[163:41.82]Maybe one day.
[163:43.46]I'll play it for your birthday.

[164:03.15]Fucking jumping.
[164:07.91]Stop.
[164:15.91]Jumping.
[164:17.45]Oh, fucking jumping.
[164:21.84]Am I going to actually dive right now?
[164:26.48]You went Swedish.
[164:27.92]Jumping.
[164:28.50]Ooh, a potato.
[164:42.66]Okay, hello.
[164:46.48]I killed them all.
[164:48.43]We wouldn't dare try to kill that many.
[164:49.73]There must have been hundreds.
[164:51.03]It took some creativity.
[164:52.83]He's starting to look up.
[164:53.59]Thank you.
[164:54.99]Can you help me?
[164:55.53]I have to get to Perth.
[164:57.47]Why do you want to go to Perth?
[164:58.23]It's completely overrun.
[165:00.91]Peter told me if I might find someone there who could help me get off this island.
[165:04.07]I've made it this far.
[165:04.77]I don't think you understand.
[165:06.71]There are thousands of them and they have an overlord.
[165:09.70]Haven't you seen the tower?
[165:11.06]Here we go.
[165:13.04]Some say there are demons from the underworld.
[165:15.50]They have power beyond our comprehension.
[165:20.20]Grouping up with more survivors is our best chance.
[165:23.59]Kirkwall is the nearest city and it had a significant military presence.
[165:28.11]How do I get there?
[165:29.61]It's down the mountain from the north side of the lake.
[165:31.67]There are several rows that lead there.
[165:33.25]Just take any.
[165:34.56]Got it.
[165:35.86]Okay.
[165:38.48]Let's go.
[165:40.65]We're going to Kirkwall.
[165:44.57]That's far away.
[165:45.23]Skill points.
[165:46.13]All right.
[166:07.24]Rage charge.
[166:09.30]Charge forward while performing two horizontal swings.
[166:11.28]All right.
[166:13.84]Rage charge.
[166:17.54]And then... Should I hold on to more points?
[166:21.76]This is one-handed attack.
[166:25.60]Dark arts.
[166:26.16]Oh, shit.
[166:26.50]Hold on.
[166:27.75]Instantaneous travel to previous zones you visited.
[166:32.51]Ooh, all right.
[166:40.56]And then... Move in space some... What?
[166:45.73]Okay.
[166:47.33]Increases damage resistance by... Can I talk?
[166:50.71]Damage resistance... I just eat it like peanut butter.
[166:55.47]What the fuck is wrong with me?
[166:58.27]This dude is baked.
[167:04.13]That guy in there sounds like a public toilet that can talk.
[167:08.13]A public toilet can talk.
[167:16.70]How do I use the charge?
[167:18.74]Even abilities as well.
[167:19.72]There it is.
[167:20.08]Okay, ready?
[167:20.46]Pretty cool.
[167:24.41]Alright.
[167:26.73]It's time to start the journey.
[167:30.59]To Kirkwall.
[167:31.53]Let's go this way.
[167:33.29]So this apparently has a military presence.
[167:35.37]This is about to get very interesting, I think.
[167:36.87]I believe this is going to get interesting.
[167:51.09]Go to early access.
[167:52.19]What is there?
[167:56.21]I think this is the name of the zone.
[167:57.51]Are you mispronouncing it?
[167:59.97]It's like early access or something.
[168:01.50]It's the country or something.
[168:03.16]Oh, fuck.
[168:16.29]Don't jump off of this, you fucking dope.
[168:19.51]I need to get a good look.
[168:25.29]Look in the wrong way.
[168:26.15]We gotta go this way.
[168:27.53]And we have to go over Vienna Lake.
[168:29.37]Into... Okay.
[168:29.57]So we gotta go that way.
[168:30.05]Ow.
[168:30.11]Ow.
[168:30.17]Ow.
[168:30.23]Ow.
[168:30.31]Ow.

[169:01.36]Get out of here.
[169:07.27]Okay.
[169:16.38]Okay, we're good.
[169:18.22]Just got to get over there before the weird guy comes and gets me.
[169:22.66]Oh.
[169:31.48]He missed.
[169:32.22]He even made... He even made a... Oops.
[169:42.65]Oh, no, I missed.
[169:43.57]Oh, man.
[169:44.11]Okay, let's go... We're going the right way.
[170:05.23]I'll just climb.
[170:06.83]Yeah, fuck.
[170:07.23]Wait, hold on.
[170:07.49]There might be food in here.
[170:14.05]Raid charge sucks.
[170:17.32]How do I get in here?
[170:19.20]What the fuck are you doing?
[170:20.46]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[170:27.03]It's time to run.
[170:29.23]Please don't.
[170:30.39]Okay.
[170:38.80]Did I get away?
[170:39.24]I got away.
[170:45.45]I think I got away.
[170:46.03]Oh, OK, I did.
[171:02.71]Oh, this is actually pretty beautiful.
[171:04.93]Wow, look at this.
[171:06.19]You can see this.
[171:10.35]Pretty cool.
[171:13.95]That must be Kirkwall.
[171:15.75]Kirkwall.
[171:16.39]Okay.
[171:28.96]Oh, it hurt.
[171:30.42]It hurt.
[171:32.70]I didn't even go that far.
[171:33.92]I have to regen.
[171:41.57]Don't do anything stupid.
[171:42.63]Just fly there.
[171:48.63]I have to be there first before I can fly there.
[171:51.64]Alright, there's a house right here.
[171:52.50]Holy shit, don't die.
[171:56.18]Okay, I'm good.
[171:59.12]Level 9.
[171:59.86]What am I, level 8?
[172:15.37]How do I regen?
[172:23.82]I have to move.
[172:34.43]I can't.
[172:35.87]I don't have any healing potions or anything.
[172:44.01]I'm good.
[172:44.53]This works.
[172:54.27]Okay, now I have to be really extra careful here.
[172:56.62]I need to get on the road.
[172:58.86]Is there like an apple of food in this house?
[173:03.16]These guys are tough.
[173:04.12]Just run.
[173:06.32]Run.
[173:06.58]Run away.
[173:07.02]Just run.
[173:09.36]Don't stop for anything.
[173:10.18]I have to go.
[173:10.72]I said don't stop for anything.
[173:12.38]Up to here.
[173:21.73]You say run.
[173:36.83]Is he gonna know what that is?
[173:40.11]I have watched television before.
[173:41.37]Alright, I gotta go left here.
[173:48.48]I saw season one.
[173:49.29]I was like, all right, okay.
[173:57.95]Got to season two when they just did the thing where every character like it's just a tournament arc.
[174:03.63]I was like, I don't like this.
[174:05.54]I'm just bored.
[174:08.28]Do the good stuff, please.
[174:14.01]We're in 45 episodes.
[174:15.47]There's like one, maybe 12 minute segment where anything really progresses in any of the story.
[174:20.81]I mean, I'm not a big fan of that kind of style.
[174:22.85]I know it's cool.
[174:23.67]You know, I get it.
[174:24.25]I have to go, uh, through here.
[174:29.51]This is too dangerous.
[174:30.32]I gotta take the road.
[174:31.24]Not doing that.
[174:31.94]I'm not stupid.
[175:02.26]Chests.
[175:04.57]Nothing.
[175:07.07]Nothing.
[175:13.21]Is that Kirkwall?
[175:17.01]It is.
[175:17.33]That's Kirkwall.
[175:18.76]I made it.
[175:19.66]I made it to Kirkwall.
[175:21.22]It's right there.
[175:21.90]Okay, I'm going to watch out for that lag.
[175:31.58]Missed stuff.
[175:32.88]I did?
[175:36.10]Why do I think I can do that?
[175:37.12]Did I?
[175:38.97]Okay, I don't care.
[175:42.87]Oh my fucking god, don't do this to me.
[175:44.33]I'll be okay, just slide down gently.
[175:50.33]Slide easy, carefully, and we are safe.
[175:53.96]Okay.
[175:54.92]This is gonna be bastard swords at Kirkwall.
[175:58.22]I guarantee it.
[176:01.07]They said there was a huge military presence here.
[176:03.07]I'll be good.
[176:09.77]Alright, Kirkwall.
[176:11.07]I'm ready.
[176:11.93]I'm a soldier at Kirkwall now.
[176:16.02]Kirkwall East.
[176:21.30]They have military grade wraiths.
[176:31.79]Yo, when does he get to the ass-eating part?
[176:35.67]I don't know if this... There's none in this game.
[176:43.95]Alright, I'm just running.
[176:44.67]Okay, Kirkwall.
[176:47.39]Open the gate.
[176:48.11]I'm here.
[176:51.69]Close that.
[177:00.74]Okay.
[177:02.06]Kirkwall.
[177:11.59]Open.
[177:13.33]Ah, yes, traveler.
[177:14.31]We can use a man like you.
[177:18.29]Oops, never mind.
[177:19.43]Oops, all berries.
[177:20.71]All zombies again.
[177:22.77]Oops, all zombies.
[177:23.92]Never mind.
[177:24.94]It's been overrun, right?
[177:30.01]Come on.
[177:31.47]What the fuck?
[177:33.62]This is stupid No, I didn't want to go that way.
[177:41.64]Oh, I am in so much trouble now Climb this climb that my safe What
[178:04.55]not this again let me in what wrong move wrong move wrong move wrong move wrong move wrong move excuse me excuse me excuse me excuse me excuse me excuse me
[178:42.49]Wait, it's empty.
[178:45.05]OK, can I get into Kirkwall?
[178:47.95]Can I actually get in there?
[178:48.85]Can I just run in there?
[178:49.79]I think I was trying to go in this house.
[178:51.07]They're all going to go in the house and get stuck.
[178:53.73]They're all going to get stuck in here.
[179:03.02]This sounds like a school cafeteria.
[179:10.94]Heel?
[179:17.25]Corn.
[179:19.78]Potato.
[179:20.36]Pain reduction.
[179:23.16]Okay, I got potatoes.
[179:43.53]Where are they?
[179:44.54]There was a thousand of them.
[179:46.36]Are they in the house?
[179:50.93]Aren't you kind of curious?
[180:27.90]Oh shit, bad idea.
[180:40.87]Just stay on the roofs.
[180:43.45]Nobody can hurt me if I'm on the roof.
[180:45.63]Give me my gun.
[180:47.11]I feel more comfortable with the gun.
[180:56.18]Oh no.
[181:05.79]I just... I don't... It doesn't make any sense.
[181:12.13]Roof to roof.
[181:13.85]Okay, now from here I can... Nice.
[181:18.62]Alright, I made it.
[181:19.20]I think this is safe.
[181:24.24]This dude's a fucking squirrel.
[181:27.83]It's kind of... I gotta go in there.
[181:38.24]That's a bomb.
[181:41.14]You know what I'm going to do with this thing.
[181:43.56]Right?
[181:44.48]You know what I'm going to do with this.
[181:46.56]I'm going to kill like 200 of them.
[182:05.57]Why is there so much...
[182:07.88]Corn.
[182:10.21]I'm seeing far less weapons and items and way more corn than I should be seeing.
[182:14.45]Okay, let's get the grenade ready.
[182:22.61]I got it.
[182:22.93]I got some potatoes, so I gotta go back up here.
[182:30.63]Alright, I'm throwing this thing in there.
[182:37.83]I go, uh, can I go up and out?
[182:41.17]Yes, I can.
[182:41.61]Okay.
[182:42.79]What do you mean doors locked?
[182:43.67]Give me a break.
[182:45.49]Never mind.
[182:45.83]I don't care.
[182:46.57]Give me up.
[182:49.90]Alright, I'm going for it.
[182:54.32]Just be slow.
[182:56.60]No horde anywhere.
[182:57.66]This is good.
[182:58.18]Where the hell is everybody?
[183:15.39]I mean, I didn't kill any of these things.
[183:19.75]There's blood everywhere.
[183:20.59]I didn't do this.
[183:35.09]Oh, my God.
[183:36.55]I don't want to rump.
[183:44.60]Why did everybody despawn?
[183:57.73]Oh, they did not despawn.
[183:58.93]They're all just over here.
[183:59.77]All right, hold on.
[184:00.37]I want to try to pull everybody over here and just throw a grenade right in the middle and just watch the fucking fireworks.
[184:07.63]Here they come.
[184:17.08]Come on over here.
[184:18.76]I want the entire group.
[184:20.62]Shoot the knight.
[184:21.78]Shoot the knight.
[184:22.34]Alright.
[184:28.66]I shot the guy behind him.
[184:29.82]Hold on.
[184:33.44]He's moving around erratically.
[184:34.48]Come on.
[184:47.84]Whatever.
[184:54.56]You found it!
[184:55.90]Alright, here we go.
[184:56.64]It's just another priest in here.
[185:00.45]Good to see another face.
[185:04.71]We can always use the extra hands.
[185:05.93]I just came from Grimsby.
[185:06.79]There are a few survivors back that way.
[185:09.99]Perhaps we shall send a search part to go help them out when we have the time.
[185:16.62]Sprouted from the ground.
[185:17.32]I must be a source of power.
[185:18.87]I need to get into that tower.
[185:20.61]Either you're insane or you're up to something questionable.
[185:24.15]Neither.
[185:24.39]I believe there is something useful.
[185:25.47]We could put an end to all of this.
[185:27.27]I hope you're right.
[185:28.45]But between you and me... Between you and the tower are 10,000 possessed.
[185:34.39]Huh.
[185:34.75]How many soldiers are here?
[185:36.87]A couple thousand.
[185:38.27]But you'll need to talk to the general.
[185:40.88]Where can I find the general?
[185:42.34]He's down at the garrison, northeast outskirts.
[185:45.25]I will go talk to the general.
[185:48.37]And maybe I can save some time.
[186:04.26]For a great low rate you can save online, go to the general and save some time.
[186:09.86]Generally even actually a good insurance company.
[186:11.40]You know what I mean?
[186:20.83]Are they?
[186:24.73]They're horrible.
[186:26.41]Are they really?
[186:34.72]I... Shaq uses them.
[186:40.19]um no guys I'm not I'm not sure that shaq actually uses the general I could be corrected and that's fine if I need to be corrected I will it's like okay if I was paid to tell you guys about like gamer goo or something
[187:10.32]It doesn't mean I eat gamer goo all the time.
[187:14.26]Try this new snack.
[187:15.98]Gamer snack.
[187:19.61]I show it on camera.
[187:21.03]I wave my hands a little bit.
[187:21.99]I go, look at me.
[187:23.31]Add content.
[187:23.95]And then I just never eat it ever again.
[187:25.31]Can I jump down here?
[187:36.72]This is going to be a huge battle soon, and I cannot wait.
[187:40.15]It's all been leading up to this moment.
[187:43.55]I'm dead if I jump down there.
[188:15.88]I'm fine.
[188:16.40]Calm down.
[188:24.94]I love how you do like the cod run.
[188:26.32]You know what I mean?
[188:27.08]The gun moving back and forth.
[188:28.28]Alright.
[188:28.56]There he is.
[188:31.91]Give me all of your finest soldiers.
[188:34.99]I'm ready to do battle with the demons.
[188:37.51]I need help to get into that tower.
[188:42.91]Would you like a crown as well?
[188:44.49]I'm serious.
[188:45.05]First off, I don't know who you are.
[188:47.63]Or why... Do you know there's something... Do you look behind you?
[188:51.11]First of all, I don't know who you are, so why should I help you?
[188:53.88]I believe there's something in that tower that could put an end to all of this.
[188:57.32]And what would that be?
[188:58.32]A body part from a god.
[189:01.20]Oh, really?
[189:01.76]You're going to have to prove your trustworth first.
[189:05.78]What must I do?
[189:07.95]Well, behind me there are maybe six to seven hundred of them.
[189:13.16]I'm sure you hear them.
[189:14.48]There's a wagon that's turned over.
[189:16.36]I need to see your prowess.
[189:18.20]Stand on top of the wagon and spin around four hundred times, cutting off as many heads as possible.
[189:26.37]I'm a fucking, I'm good at that.
[189:29.30]There's an ancient relic, a weapon at Arbor Hollow.
[189:33.68]What sort of weapon?
[189:35.26]Let's just say it'll help.
[189:36.62]I'll do whatever it takes.
[189:38.22]Oh, and by the way, there are hundreds of those zombies in the hollow.
[189:41.44]Okay.
[189:42.94]Just avoid the front entrance and I'm sure you'll define.
[189:44.94]Hee hee.
[189:50.32]Is this like a cute text from a girlfriend or is he telling me to be careful I could get killed by hundreds of monsters?
[189:57.81]I'm sure you divine.
[189:58.55]Oh, hee hee.
[190:01.47]We're the ones fighting.
[190:03.33]I died.
[190:04.89]Oh my god, that's so many people.
[190:07.71]Uh, so we have to go... Down here?
[190:10.68]Arbor Hollow.
[190:13.74]Be quick about it.
[190:18.18]Alright, I thought I just said... I thought I just failed the mission.
[190:21.18]We're gonna kill them all.
[190:31.52]Where are the soldiers, by the way?
[190:34.10]It's just you.
[190:34.76]Are there supposed to be like 3,000 people?
[190:41.35]No, we're not.
[190:43.75]It's me and you, man.
[190:45.87]It's just the two of us.
[190:47.35]This is not going to work out.
[191:09.09]I gotta get a spot.
[191:10.79]I have to get a spot.
[191:12.39]Right there on top of that tiny little rock.
[191:13.96]I think it's gonna be good.
[191:18.78]I think I can get on top of that little rock.
[191:20.20]And I think I'll be fine, right?
[191:22.92]Oh my god.
[191:32.96]Oh my god.
[191:33.50]Throw the grenade.
[191:35.38]Oh shit.
[191:36.36]Oh my god.
[191:42.73]There's too many spawning Oh my god they're aggroing I did not kill anything
[192:07.72]It's the Cal level from Diablo 2.
[192:10.47]That's perfect.
[192:12.01]That's a perfect description.
[192:14.71]Get on the rock quick.
[192:21.41]Okay, let me do the mission.
[192:29.04]I gotta finish this.
[192:45.92]I can't wait to do the battle.
[192:47.20]You know it's going to be such a shit show.
[192:49.26]It's going to be so stupid.
[192:50.38]It's going to be worth the three to four hours to get there.
[192:53.60]It's going to be the most unbearable stupid thing I've ever seen and I can't wait.
[193:00.68]Okay, how do I get at it?
[193:08.94]Okay, anyone remember when they were really trying to show off Days Gone?
[193:14.02]This is what the... Fucking potato.
[193:21.44]This was the cool feature in Days Gone, remember?
[193:23.74]Goddammit, I lost my chat again.
[193:28.00]The tower.
[193:37.59]It mocks me.
[193:39.44]No, I don't have the weapon.
[193:42.06]I need the weapon.
[193:45.05]The relic.
[193:47.55]Arbor Hollow.
[193:48.65]Where am I now?
[193:49.23]Okay, I gotta go down.
[193:57.60]Down.
[193:57.90]Alright, down here.
[194:01.72]The tower.
[194:03.78]The tower!
[194:06.90]Okay, we just wrap around and go to Arbor Hollow.
[194:09.02]I can't wait to do this.
[194:09.90]This is going to be so much fun.
[194:13.80]This is the part of the stream where my computer crashes.
[194:16.64]And then when it crashes, I'm just turning the stream off.
[194:28.18]No human could do that.
[194:30.12]Nobody could do that.
[194:30.82]That doesn't make any sense, but I'm glad I was able to do it.
[194:41.26]Teleport.
[194:48.18]I can't.
[194:48.70]I'm already like almost there.
[194:49.68]You can only go to safe places.
[195:02.26]Oh, okay.
[195:05.22]And Arbor Hollow is right here.
[195:07.00]Let's go straight.
[195:11.09]I need to heal, though.
[195:12.21]I have tomatoes and stuff.
[195:14.81]I'm good.
[195:16.61]Rumor was raising a barn.
[195:22.46]Oh, he closed the door.
[195:23.42]What are you raising a barn?
[195:25.04]There it is.
[195:32.84]Okay.
[195:37.76]That's not good.
[195:38.58]This weapon is terrible.
[195:40.10]Let's just be honest.
[195:48.29]What a great selection.
[195:52.81]The door is locked.
[195:57.07]Okay.
[196:09.36]Climb!
[196:10.96]Climb the ladder!
[196:12.73]What?
[196:13.11]Is this a fake ladder?
[196:29.62]How?
[196:30.48]What?
[196:30.74]No, it's not.
[196:33.68]I just grabbed it.
[196:52.51]What?
[196:52.77]What just happened?
[197:08.81]Oh shit, I'm dead!
[197:10.21]Or not.
[197:27.77]Is it door?
[197:56.07]Oh, hi.
[197:56.57]Yeah, I know.
[197:57.39]Going to... Arbor Hollow.
[198:01.91]Yeah.
[198:03.11]Thanks for the rake.
[198:05.59]Thanks for the rake.
[198:06.43]Thanks for... No weapons.
[198:10.27]I just have a broken, dusty-ass sword.
[198:12.81]A one-handed sword, a knife, and a rake.
[198:15.70]And a ore.
[198:21.00]I... Where do I get... Where do you get a weapon?
[198:26.74]Let's go.
[198:27.84]Whatever.
[198:34.96]It's not that far.
[198:35.72]It's fine.
[198:38.32]Sing the fucking rake song.
[198:44.47]Swish swish.
[198:46.09]Swish swish.
[198:48.07]Rake up those leaves and have a...
[198:55.60]some fun when you break up the leaves swish swish swish swish break up the leaves and make a wish go in the weapon store
[199:35.15]Break me up break me up inside.
[199:37.69]No that doesn't work.
[199:39.61]That's stupid I can't break up Call my name and save me from the dark Leave my blood to rot
[199:56.85]I've been raking a lie.
[200:10.38]There's no leaves outside.
[200:12.13]That's a tuber joke.
[200:15.45]It's fine though.
[200:20.77]How do I get up here?
[200:21.37]I don't even know.
[200:25.02]Oh, turn around.
[200:30.64]Now it's dark.
[200:32.38]This is not the way you're supposed to do this mission.
[200:35.00]But I have to do it as fast as possible because I can't help it.
[200:38.48]I have to get to the 10,000 person fight.
[200:47.57]Am I running up a mountain?
[200:52.15]I think I am.
[200:54.13]Alright, I was.
[201:13.54]I think I can get out.
[201:35.40]It's quicksand.
[201:36.84]It's quicksand.
[201:38.96]It's quicksand.
[201:39.90]I can't die.
[201:57.46]I think it might be possible to get out.
[202:08.30]I can do fast travel?
[202:11.25]But I'm right here!
[202:14.17]Oh, come on!
[202:15.05]Ow, my legs!
[202:18.15]Did you hear that?
[202:24.75]Did I lose the legs when I teleported back?
[202:28.75]It's me.
[202:29.19]Uh-huh.
[202:30.36]Goodbye.
[202:31.58]I'm just taking the goddamn road.
[202:33.26]No more jumping over mountains.
[202:36.56]So I have to go out here and then on the road.
[202:38.50]Whatever.
[202:39.24]I'm going up the mountains.
[202:39.98]I don't care.
[202:40.34]Just get the fuck out.
[202:45.76]Weapons store.
[202:47.98]Right.
[202:48.22]Okay.
[202:48.36]Where's the weapons store?
[202:58.00]King's Arms.
[203:01.04]It's a fake... It's a fake building.
[203:03.12]I can't go in here.
[203:27.30]That's not how that works, but okay.
[203:28.92]I'll take it.
[203:42.92]Am I just standing on the ground?
[203:57.59]What the fuck am I doing?
[203:59.09]Hello?
[204:11.47]Hello?
[204:12.69]Anyone there?
[204:13.87]Hello?
[204:14.51]Hello?
[204:15.39]Yeah.
[204:16.59]Yeah.
[204:18.21]Get off of me, you fiend!
[204:27.92]Climb it!
[204:30.82]We gotta take care of that!
[204:46.19]Eat, eat!
[204:46.69]Can I eat the potato?
[204:47.55]Go.
[204:48.59]I think I made it out of the town.
[204:49.89]I did, I'm good.
[204:57.92]Too much.
[205:02.79]Okay.
[205:13.35]What are you living about?
[205:15.54]He got through.
[205:16.20]Never mind.
[205:22.44]Okay.
[205:22.92]Almost there.
[205:23.64]Bang him right.
[205:31.28]Right.
[205:31.80]There could be some supplies in here.
[205:35.68]I'm going to wait.
[205:36.54]I'm just going to wait it out.
[205:38.02]I'm going to wait till it's daytime.
[205:38.98]I ain't going anywhere.
[205:40.10]I'm just going to hang out here for a little bit.
[205:42.12]Okay.
[205:43.18]If you have a problem with that, then, you know, there's millions of other streamers right now that you could go watch.
[205:48.95]You have a problem with me standing here waiting for sunlight to go up?
[205:51.97]I can name you a thousand streamers right now that are streaming right now.
[205:54.71]You could go stream to them.
[205:57.27]Okay.
[205:57.41]Okay.
[205:59.61]Oh, people have a problem with that apparently.
[206:01.49]Okay, fine.
[206:15.91]9k Andy raging on stream.
[206:18.79]I need some supplies.
[206:30.39]Betty's.
[206:31.99]I forgot about that, yeah.
[206:33.61]Betty's.
[206:38.70]That's a long time ago.
[206:39.58]I should- Let me do some repairing.
[206:54.69]Drop all this crap.
[206:56.23]Drop a femur bone.
[206:57.42]Drop the rusty broken sword.
[206:59.74]There's no reason to have any of this stuff.
[207:08.26]Rake is going to be one.
[207:09.04]Kitchen's knife is going to be two.
[207:11.38]Common peasant sword will be three.
[207:13.74]Rifle will be four.
[207:15.03]And just get rid of the bone.
[207:19.41]Okay.
[207:19.93]Blessing potion.
[207:20.63]Vial of pain reduction.
[207:27.09]Okay.
[207:31.86]Second breath.
[207:34.14]Stamina.
[207:34.68]Pain reduction.
[207:37.82]Paraket.
[207:38.66]Broom.
[207:41.20]Herb milk.
[207:42.32]Herb milk.
[207:43.42]Yeah, that's kind of gross.
[207:44.66]What is herb milk?
[207:45.54]Alright, is it almost light?
[208:01.29]Prepare the knife, prepare the rake, prepare the gun.
[208:08.60]How's the sword?
[208:09.88]The sword's fine.
[208:10.36]What are you linking here?
[208:18.25]All potato for a hundred thousand off the debt.
[208:21.13]That's not, that's worthless.
[208:35.57]Anything else in here?
[208:36.25]Oh, bullets.
[208:36.63]Okay, bullets.
[208:40.34]I wonder when this is going to come to PS5.
[208:43.20]Okay.
[208:55.66]Daylight is about to be upon us.
[208:58.67]Kind of wish I could pick up the 2x4 and use that instead.
[209:00.83]Alright, so we're going this way.
[209:02.21]We're right here.
[209:08.43]There's a ton of people here.
[209:10.13]Or did they spawn in yet?
[209:10.87]Can I get in before they spawn?
[209:12.99]No, they're here.
[209:13.53]Alright, so what's the strategy here?
[209:16.29]I can't just run in the front door.
[209:17.35]I have to go up there and go in that way.
[209:20.79]How do I get up there?
[209:23.40]Around?
[209:24.68]Maybe around the mountain?
[209:38.47]Can I keep going up from here?
[209:39.59]That'd be pretty cool.
[209:42.46]Don't you think so?
[210:01.03]Wait, that's the trap that I got in before.
[210:02.95]This is the same place.
[210:05.15]Do not go over there.
[210:06.38]That's the quicksand.
[210:16.21]Get it?
[210:16.85]Fuck.
[210:22.33]Shit.
[210:31.41]Grab onto that.
[210:32.77]Why do you pick and choose what ledges you're gonna jump onto?
[210:38.52]It wants me to go up there.
[210:42.99]All joke waiting room.
[210:44.23]Somebody said that probably.
[210:46.19]Stop pretending to fall down the mountain.
[210:53.80]I was about to just jump off and die.
[210:54.92]This left person got very angry with me.
[210:59.56]Uh.
[211:10.73]There we go.
[211:11.63]Finally.
[211:12.11]Okay.
[211:13.51]Now I'm in a good position.
[211:14.37]What's that light?
[211:32.45]Are you exhausted from pretending?
[211:34.19]No, not yet.
[211:34.63]I still got at least like another... I got like another hour at least of pretending.
[211:50.80]I know I can get up there, but that I gotta get right there.
[211:53.98]How do I do that?
[212:00.24]That looks like kind of good, but I guess not.
[212:02.23]Go in the front door.
[212:12.05]I can't.
[212:12.57]There's like 5,000 people in the front door.
[212:14.59]I have to go all the way around, don't I?
[212:17.81]All the way around back.
[212:30.57]Don't kill me Whopper watch?
[212:47.63]That sounds kind of good right now actually I would take a whopper right now.
[212:54.24]I don't even like Burger King
[212:58.93]I would say Burger King is my least favorite out of the three.
[213:01.44]But you bring a Whopper in here right now, you present one to me, I would eat it on stream.
[213:06.82]After every bite, I'd go, mmm.
[213:09.88]Mmm.
[213:11.14]Oh, my God.
[213:11.88]Oh, my God.
[213:13.76]Take a huge bite.
[213:14.87]Oh, my God.
[213:15.45]Oh, my God.
[213:16.01]Mm-hmm.
[213:34.61]Found it.
[213:34.91]I can't wait for the 10,000 person fight.
[213:40.85]It's coming up soon.
[213:47.30]Eat it on stream for the debt reduced.
[213:48.74]So if I take a bite of a Whopper and I do the... Oh my God.
[213:52.80]Oh my God.
[213:53.00]It's so good.
[213:54.80]Try it.
[213:55.02]Try it.
[213:55.28]Try it.
[213:56.24]Oh my God.
[213:57.26]How much is that?
[213:57.74]How much do I have reduced?
[214:10.60]I would look like such a dickhead.
[214:12.06]It would be so embarrassing.
[214:15.30]But I might do it.
[214:16.22]Because that's kind of funny to me.
[214:17.72]I think that's kind of funny.
[214:20.60]Just be in IRL.
[214:21.66]Just chatting.
[214:23.86]Without context.
[214:24.64]You're just eating a Burger King burger.
[214:26.56]And you just can't stop talking about how much you love it.
[214:28.42]And you're doing the oh my god thing.
[214:30.27]Putting your hand up.
[214:31.83]Take a bite.
[214:32.63]Oh my god.
[214:32.93]Put your hand up.
[214:35.11]Not covering your mouth.
[214:36.71]But covering in front of your mouth.
[214:39.79]And do that after every bite.
[214:48.44]Until it's gone.
[214:56.90]I'll think about it.
[214:57.74]I'll think about it.
[214:58.36]Okay.
[214:59.68]Gotta get up there.
[215:14.80]It's hilariously bad.
[215:16.38]I don't know.
[215:18.40]It kind of, it's making me laugh right now.
[215:20.70]And like a lot of times that's all it takes.
[215:22.51]So, you know, we'll see.
[215:27.63]We'll see.
[215:29.67]Can I go up from here?
[215:51.55]We'll double the offer if you do it tonight.

[224:34.98]I'll do it later this week.
[224:38.16]I don't want a Whopper right now.
[224:40.56]I want something else.
[224:51.81]I said if you presented me with a whopper, I'd eat it.
[224:53.87]I didn't say I would love to go order a fucking whopper.
[224:56.99]They're gross.
[224:58.59]Shit.
[224:59.11]They're, no, they're, um, they're, they're okay.
[225:04.21]Uh, how many, look at all these cat boys.
[225:08.75]That's like cat boy number five.
[225:21.20]A revised deal.
[225:22.16]I'm not doing it tonight.
[225:24.18]I will get Burger King.
[225:26.34]And I will open with that.
[225:28.12]At some point this week.
[225:30.04]I'm going to do it.
[225:30.68]Because I think it's funny.
[225:32.62]And I'm going to do it.
[225:35.38]I can't wait to do that.
[225:36.62]Because it's going to make a lot of people.
[225:40.40]Hate me.
[225:41.50]Alright let's keep going.
[225:42.51]I'm almost at the end.
[225:44.03]Of this game.
[225:47.53]Some pretty sick art though.
[225:48.49]What do you think?
[225:49.25]I think so too.
[225:52.22]Hold on a second.
[225:52.84]We got an animation.
[225:58.65]You're going to feel like shit for the rest of the stream.
[226:00.35]Yeah, I don't want to eat like Burger King right now.
[226:13.98]Not right now.
[226:15.42]I thought about it.
[226:16.20]I was really thinking about, but like, no.
[226:18.82]I almost just walked right off the edge.
[226:19.98]Okay, that was, that was stupid.
[226:21.14]All right, I got the, um, I got the item.
[226:23.52]Let's just teleport.
[226:32.82]500 million per McChicken eaten tonight.
[226:36.67]I don't think you want to do that deal, man.
[226:39.17]I can eat dozens of chicken nuggets.
[226:44.37]If I really was hungry and I really sat down.
[226:46.25]I'm not kidding.
[226:47.43]I could probably eat 50.
[226:48.17]In one sitting.
[226:50.91]Over the course of about maybe like an hour.
[226:53.06]I could probably eat 50 McChickens.
[226:54.88]No.
[226:56.60]Nuggets.
[226:58.58]It's a lot.
[226:58.98]That's too much.
[227:02.10]Alright.
[227:08.05]So now it's time.
[227:08.97]I have the relic.
[227:10.05]I have the item.
[227:12.44]Why are you still playing this?
[227:13.56]I don't know, because I want to see the huge battle that happens in about 10 minutes.
[227:19.60]No, I could definitely eat, without a problem, 20 to 30 chicken nuggets.
[227:26.02]And I would be able to stand up and stretch my back and go... I feel okay.
[227:31.78]And I would lie down for a little while.
[227:33.67]I'd be able to do it.
[227:35.99]After about 30, I'd have to clock out.
[227:37.31]I would.
[227:37.61]Maybe like 35, 40.
[227:42.44]Hey, I can, listen, I can definitely eat as many chicken nuggets as years I've been alive.
[227:48.02]Guaranteed.
[227:59.27]That's easy.
[228:00.67]Yeah, for some of you, for some of you 15 year olds, some of you, yeah, what are you?
[228:04.39]16?
[228:04.41]20?
[228:04.43]18?
[228:04.73]30?
[228:04.79]I'm 35.
[228:04.97]That's a lot of nuggets.
[228:12.50]Some of you guys are like in your early 20s.
[228:14.42]I'm in my mid 30s.
[228:15.68]That's a lot different.
[228:18.72]I know a lot of you guys are like, oh yeah, it was my 19th birthday.
[228:21.24]Yeah, I can eat 19 nuggets.
[228:22.64]Try 35.
[228:22.84]35 is not impressive.
[228:23.46]Yes, it is.
[228:37.67]I gauge how impressive eating food is by the burger boy index here.
[228:42.65]Like the burger boy like tier list.
[228:45.93]Burger boy I think could... I think burger boy one time ate like 44 or like 45 nuggets.
[228:50.07]They come in six pieces, right?
[228:52.04]6, 12, 18, 24, 32, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.
[228:52.24]Yeah.
[228:52.36]No.
[228:52.42]46. 46.
[229:05.04]Yeah, I think Burger Boy's eaten 46 nuggets before in one sitting.
[229:15.06]That's a lie.
[229:21.70]Somebody just wrote, who the fuck is Burger Boy?
[229:25.49]Right.
[229:25.79]A lot of you guys are new.
[229:26.65]I forgot.
[229:27.53]I forget that sometimes.
[229:29.79]Who the fuck is Burger Boy?
[229:34.55]All right, here we go.
[229:35.61]How would we get in the tower?
[229:36.73]How do you feel about a full-scale war?
[229:38.98]Do we have enough men?
[229:41.42]Isn't there 10,000 possessed?
[229:44.06]With my tactics and this weapon, we could do it with 500 men.
[229:49.77]You're the general, so you would know.
[229:51.57]When does the battle start?
[229:53.35]Prepare yourself and come back when you're ready.
[229:55.25]Then we will start.
[229:56.31]Okay.
[230:02.96]I'm ready.
[230:04.29]All you have are brooms, rakes, and kitchen knives.
[230:10.07]Take 15 of my men and flank through the right side of the tunnels.
[230:14.51]The rest of the army will charge through the front gate.
[230:19.06]Ring the bell on this platform to start.
[230:23.52]Alright, let's go.
[230:24.88]It's time to do it.
[230:25.68]Here we go.
[230:26.04]It's time for the final battle.
[230:29.05]Start the battle by ringing the bell.
[230:32.92]Oh shit, here they come.
[230:35.95]I gotta get in there.
[230:36.49]I gotta get in line.
[230:39.29]Wait, 15.
[230:39.67]This is like a hundred.
[230:56.93]What do you want to do guys?
[230:58.67]Why are we going through one single door?
[231:02.85]This is not the easiest way for us to fucking loot.
[231:09.51]We're going through a single bathroom doorway.
[231:15.43]Get in!
[231:15.67]Fight!
[231:15.89]Fight them!
[231:26.36]Get out of the way.
[231:27.26]I'm a traitor.
[231:27.86]Come on, man.
[231:28.30]Wait, what is going on?
[231:49.32]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[231:56.34]Shit.
[231:56.72]Oh.
[232:18.70]We gotta get in the front door, man.
[232:20.24]Hold on.
[232:21.88]Where's my brake?
[232:23.96]Where's the brake?
[232:26.56]How do I change weapons?
[232:28.74]No, I want to change... Come on, man!
[232:40.16]Charge forward!
[232:50.51]They still can't get in.
[232:53.87]They're all stuck in here.
[232:55.11]Why are they all going over here?
[232:56.39]They're trying to climb the wall.
[233:01.06]Get out of the way!
[233:06.04]Move!
[233:12.97]It's so stupid.
[233:14.77]They're so stuck.
[233:22.91]I wish I had a grenade or something.
[233:25.21]I don't have any grenades.
[233:26.75]I have nothing.
[233:31.50]Use the relic?
[233:36.14]What relic?
[233:38.12]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[233:40.14]Don't hit me.
[233:41.68]I'm your captain, you dummy.
[233:44.78]Use the relic.
[233:46.88]I don't know where the... Where's the relic?
[233:52.57]Broom.
[233:54.71]Repair kit.
[233:55.35]Crossbow.
[233:56.90]Stamina.
[233:57.94]Pitcher knife.
[233:58.58]Rake.
[234:00.46]Musket.
[234:01.54]Merchant.
[234:01.96]Crossbow.
[234:13.86]Okay, for a second I thought that was one of ours, but he was naked.
[234:17.90]Like, he took his armor off before he died.
[234:20.30]I have no idea why though.
[234:31.86]Wait, am I pissing him off?
[234:42.24]I don't think these guys have health.
[234:44.41]Wait, I can see that guy's bones!
[234:51.67]Turn on potato mode?
[235:14.04]This is going to take a minute.
[235:16.44]Lowest resolution.
[235:19.90]Oh my God.
[235:22.76]What just happened?
[235:33.07]They turned into just shields except for
[235:44.72]Alright, charge in!
[235:56.91]This is like Lord of the Rings.
[235:58.09]It is like Lord of the Rings.
[236:01.66]And still only counts as one.
[236:05.92]Especially if you kill 15 of your own men.
[236:16.02]I can't.
[236:17.44]Let's do the highest.
[236:19.10]Let's do ultra.

[236:35.90]No, it's not.
[236:36.40]I got a 1080.
[236:37.22]1080 is still good enough.
[236:42.08]Still good.
[236:46.02]Okay, it's raining right now.
[236:47.45]It's kind of hard to tell if this is red rain or not.
[237:00.31]I think we're going to get in.
[237:03.55]Use the new weapon?
[237:04.37]I don't know where... I don't have it.
[237:09.64]Where's my new weapon?
[237:11.22]It's not even in my inventory.
[237:15.65]On the right.
[237:16.75]Vial of Pain.
[237:17.47]Blessing.

[238:12.25]Why are they going backwards?
[238:13.51]Get over here.
[238:15.41]Into the castle.
[238:16.21]Let's go.
[238:28.35]Uh-oh.

[239:25.54]Why are we all going through this way?
[239:28.50]Again, we're all gonna get stuck.
[239:35.28]Excuse me.
[239:36.58]Excuse me!
[239:42.18]I'm gonna get the bad guy.

[240:20.68]That'd be so fun!
[240:28.69]That's my son up there.
[240:38.91]I don't wanna die.
[241:06.13]I don't think they're even attacking.
[241:08.05]They're just walking forward and just overwhelming them and just assimilating them into the crowd.
[241:16.63]They're not even attacking.
[241:18.94]It's just overwhelming numbers walking forward and stepping on them.
[241:23.12]I've seen maybe one of them swing a sword.
[241:24.94]Two of them.
[241:27.86]They're like an amoeba.
[241:28.92]They're like a white blood cell getting a virus.
[241:49.23]Okay, it seems like we've taken the longest way possible to get to this castle Right?
[242:15.76]Why couldn't we have just walked forward?
[242:17.22]Why are we down in this ravine?
[242:18.56]What are we down here for?
[242:29.13]I kind of want to go forward and see what's up here.
[242:30.83]Okay, we're making our way all the way to the hand tower.
[242:33.37]I kind of want to see what's up here.
[242:50.64]No!
[243:04.51]You're gonna break the sequence?
[243:06.47]Am I?
[243:06.71]No!
[243:16.20]No fall damage on Pika's head.
[243:17.72]Holy fuck, I'm almost dead.
[243:39.25]Why are they going left?
[244:02.42]Visual representation of chat.
[244:05.20]I kind of just want to get to the destination already.
[244:08.89]We have to go up in the tower.
[244:13.51]How is it possible that I could be bored by this?
[244:15.64]Isn't that kind of bizarre?
[244:29.57]I was supposed to sneak in.
[244:31.91]Oh my God, I can't even talk.
[244:32.93]I was supposed to sneak in with 15 people.
[244:41.52]I understand that, but why are they going away from the power?
[244:47.42]I went the wrong way.
[244:48.56]People spawning behind us.
[244:56.52]I went the wrong way.
[244:57.60]Come on.
[244:58.96]Can I fix it?

[259:31.95]I can store stuff?
[259:34.81]Oh, give me that back.
[259:41.93]I still have to get to the top of the tower.
[259:44.03]How am I supposed to rely?
[259:45.55]How do you do that?
[259:50.11]Why did they add this weird Far Cry segment where you just jump and parkour up a tower?
[259:57.03]Seems like it shouldn't... Sorry.
[260:08.22]I couldn't mute.
[261:03.82]It didn't work.
[261:04.40]It didn't work.
[261:05.00]You can't grab the cage.
[261:06.02]It didn't work.

[261:22.66]I just confirmed it.
[261:41.21]You can't- You can't- You- Hello?
[262:09.83]Can I move?
[262:24.55]Look up the ending on YouTube.
[262:25.76]I don't think this game has an end yet.
[262:29.50]Yeah, I'm just a ghost.
[262:30.62]I don't think I'm dead.
[262:38.60]I think that's it.
[262:39.90]I think this is when I die.
[262:40.94]It's over.
[262:59.32]You.
[263:00.88]Help me.
[263:01.56]I can't move.
[263:04.44]I'm stuck in spectator mode.

[263:21.38]Did that work?
[263:29.76]finish the climb.
[263:30.52]I don't know if I can even do it.
[263:31.54]Hold on.
[263:40.74]When I laughed really hard at all the people stuffed into the hallway, I gave myself the cough again.
[263:58.99]I started laughing and it was just, that's it.
[264:08.14]He's going to take two weeks off.
[264:10.42]No, I'm not.
[264:12.22]Get some water.
[264:12.76]I have a drink right here.
[264:19.16]Nobody click.
[264:28.20]This has been fun though.
[264:29.76]I'm glad I played it.
[264:31.91]It was just like, it was just crunchy enough.
[264:39.67]I really want to get to the top of the tower though.
[264:46.48]What was the backup game?
[264:47.60]Oh, I guess I can tell you now.
[264:51.96]Backup game was the leaf blowing simulator.
[264:57.40]Idle game.
[264:58.85]Looks awesome.
[265:01.05]I can't wait to play it.
[265:01.79]Alright.

[265:46.63]You'll see it, I will.
[265:48.97]In the house.
[265:54.86]Hey, I'm back.
[265:59.88]What's the status?
[266:02.00]I haven't made it up the tower yet.
[266:04.08]I found the body part.
[266:07.99]What do you need it for?
[266:08.83]I cannot use this weapon relics to its full power without the body part of a god.
[266:13.47]What are you going to do with this weapon?
[266:15.35]It's none of your concern.
[266:16.31]I'm the bad guy.
[266:17.75]I'm bad.
[266:18.99]You won't be leaving this place.
[266:20.43]Oh, it was really.
[266:22.69]He is...
[266:31.04]What?
[266:31.83]Ow?
[266:31.99]Oh, fuck you.
[266:37.93]You can't open doors.
[266:38.79]Yes, I can.
[266:41.28]He's a person.
[266:43.26]Let's go.
[266:43.70]Come on.
[266:44.34]Oh, I know what to do.
[266:45.38]I'm going to lead him into the fucking... I'm going to lead him into all the zombies.
[266:51.03]Where is he?
[267:01.36]Come on, dude.
[267:01.78]Let's go.
[267:04.00]Level 20.
[267:04.68]All right.
[267:06.30]Yeah.
[267:06.72]I'm going to kite this guy all the way from the Badlands to Stormwind.
[267:13.62]And this motherfucker is going to get destroyed.
[267:15.56]Am I going the right way?
[267:29.21]Okay.
[267:29.73]I think...
[267:30.71]Get out of this menu!
[267:31.39]Get out of the menu!
[267:31.99]Did he just run into something?
[267:37.48]He's like- Ow.
[267:49.07]No, he's stuck in the rocks.
[267:50.61]Come on, get up.
[267:52.87]He's pissed.
[267:54.49]Come here.
[267:59.83]I need some enemies.
[268:04.15]Where are the enemies?
[268:07.45]Where are the enemies on the map?
[268:08.45]Up here, right?
[268:08.97]Okay, come this way.
[268:34.73]Is this not supposed to happen yet?
[268:36.29]I think it wasn't.
[268:39.29]He's level 20.
[268:44.32]Look, if I have to walk him into the ocean and get killed by the boogeyman guy, that's what I'm going to do.
[268:49.62]Zombies are all dead.
[268:53.92]Are they?
[268:54.24]Alright, keep going.
[269:00.29]We'll get him.
[269:01.63]There are zombies near the tower.
[269:03.07]Yep, okay.
[269:07.16]Oh, there's some up there too, but I think there's more over this way.
[269:13.38]Take him to the windmill.
[269:14.82]I can't.
[269:15.36]I can't.
[269:16.76]I don't remember where the windmill is, guys.
[269:19.56]I don't remember where the windmill is.
[269:24.66]Where's the windmill?
[269:26.08]Get out before he gets me.
[269:32.40]Where's the windmill?
[269:33.19]I forget where the windmill is.
[269:38.22]It's like all the way down here, isn't it?
[269:53.18]I forget.
[269:53.58]I'll find it.
[269:54.32]Let's see if I can get him there.
[269:55.08]I just have to go this direction.
[269:57.08]Come on.
[270:15.14]Worst joke.
[270:16.94]This is not a joke.
[270:18.10]This is just a destiny.
[270:19.58]This has to happen.
[270:20.56]This is not a joke.
[270:21.80]This is this dude's destiny.
[270:33.51]Windmill.
[270:34.17]It's coming up here somewhere, isn't it?
[270:38.39]It's down here.
[270:52.09]Hey!
[270:56.67]No deal?
[270:57.27]I'm not making a deal.
[270:58.17]I just want to do this to this guy.
[270:59.27]Okay, a little bit more down this way.
[271:20.87]Lead him off a cliff.
[271:22.37]I guess I could.
[271:23.11]I could just... I don't think he'll come up the mountain.
[271:29.31]Is that the windmill?
[271:31.09]Is that it right there?
[271:31.73]This is actually the final boss.
[271:39.88]This is it up here, isn't it?
[271:49.52]No?
[271:54.93]Holy shit, this is so far.
[271:56.17]Well, there's people here.
[271:57.47]Never mind.
[271:59.51]Will they attack him?
[272:14.72]They do attack him.
[272:15.56]I'm going to get a cheap shot in right in the head.
[272:24.66]Where did he go?
[272:30.41]Where is he?
[272:31.29]Where did he go?
[272:33.93]Where did he go?
[273:01.35]It's just oh, I can't even anymore man.
[273:04.03]This is so stupid I was gonna lead him into the water fucking I don't care No, I can't do it again Stop oh my god I
[273:38.76]Still out here?
[273:39.82]I think he might be still out here.
[273:50.39]What the fuck?
[273:53.35]He's dead?
[273:55.81]Who killed him?
[273:56.61]What?
[274:04.08]No, what you guys don't understand is I hit this guy in the head like ten times with a hammer Eventually the adrenaline is gonna wear off and you're gonna fall down.
[274:13.23]You're gonna go to one knee and you're gonna die man.
[274:15.61]I hit him right in the back of the head like six times
[274:31.97]Oh, that was so dumb, whatever.
[274:33.81]Hey, I hope all hey, the general tried to kill me, by the way.
[274:38.81]Yes, after the invasion of the tower, I obtained a body part of a God.
[274:42.24]The general tried to kill me in attempt to take it for himself.
[274:45.68]I'm sorry to hear this, but somehow I'm not surprised.
[274:48.80]The general's behavior recently changed after he started studying the relic.
[274:52.50]I'm not sure what he's planning to do with it.
[274:55.26]I see.
[274:55.62]Is there something I should tell you?
[274:57.69]I've been having visions.
[274:58.75]I wasn't sure if they were real until now.
[275:01.37]Visions of what?
[275:02.87]Ever since I was marooned here, a mysterious white figure has been appearing and talking to me.
[275:08.03]Who do you think the white figure is?
[275:09.27]I think he might be some sort of God.
[275:10.77]He gave me the mark on my hand.
[275:13.12]Well, that confirms the visions are true.
[275:14.90]Okay.
[275:16.96]Like, I wasn't just smoking in the bathroom?
[275:19.54]Do you just believe me?
[275:21.22]What is the relevance of these body parts?
[275:23.94]He said that he could only take physical form once all the body parts are taken.
[275:33.19]Sounds like we may have yet a chance.
[275:34.43]I strongly advise you continue on this journey.
[275:36.55]Do you know of any other towers?
[275:38.85]There are three, possibly four.
[275:40.68]I don't know.
[275:42.20]Sorry, I'm not much of a navigator.
[275:45.12]Okay.
[275:46.66]Good luck.
[275:46.98]I will spread the word about what you are doing, as well as the general's betrayal.
[275:50.39]Thank you.
[275:50.69]I hope we cross paths again.
[275:59.91]Four more towers.
[276:01.05]I can tell you right now, I hate doing the other four towers.
[276:11.98]The McRib tower?
[276:13.14]I just want to look at it.
[276:15.82]I just want to see it.
[276:23.40]You didn't even do this tower.
[276:25.58]That's true.
[276:26.26]I know.
[276:28.16]I just want to look at this tower.
[276:29.08]It's in the snow area.
[276:30.62]It's right here.
[276:31.12]Alright, I just want to see.
[276:32.94]Climb the bar.
[276:49.87]No, I'm not climbing anymore.
[276:51.31]I'm not climbing the tower anymore.
[276:54.71]Alright, we need to go this way.
[276:57.22]Tower's that way.
[276:58.12]That's the direction I'm going.
[276:59.26]Let's go.
[276:59.64]There's the windmill too.
[277:13.15]Damn it.
[277:14.41]I don't even know what killed that guy either.
[277:15.87]Wait, is there a better way to go?
[277:16.91]Mmm, I gotta get up here.
[277:22.01]Uh, yeah, just go around.
[277:22.85]I'm not gonna fuck around and die.
[277:24.12]That'd be stupid.
[277:34.00]My whole body hurts right now.
[277:35.39]My like face hurts.
[277:36.39]My like eyes hurt.
[277:42.63]Oh, we had a shitload of subs come in too.
[277:47.26]Ash 686868 gave 25 community sub.
[277:53.82]Thank you, Ash, for the insane sub drop.
[278:01.19]Thank you.
[278:01.79]It's a lot of money.
[278:02.49]Thank you.
[278:02.81]Okay, I'm going to go this way.
[278:13.07]I just hit myself in the face.
[278:16.04]With the hammer.
[278:17.12]I hit it off the rock and it bounced back and the spike hit me in the forehead.
[278:21.82]Alright, here we are.
[278:35.61]Almost there.
[278:36.07]Ugh.
[278:49.03]I can't believe he played this all night.
[278:50.51]Are we sure he isn't being paid?
[278:52.01]I don't know.
[278:56.20]I don't think you understand.
[278:57.22]I wasn't going to give up after the first hour.
[279:05.42]Oh shit, look at this.
[279:12.89]Very cool.
[279:14.91]Let's go.
[279:44.44]Cool.

[280:00.85]Why can I stand on this?
[280:03.69]Don't die.
[280:04.01]Don't die.
[280:04.33]Don't die.
[280:07.28]See you guys later.
[280:20.10]I got some stuff going on over the next couple of days.
[280:21.62]I got to really hunker down and do some work.

[280:30.63]This is a lot of new characters.
[280:32.31]Really got to get some time into that.
[280:35.17]And the New Year's Eve stuff too.
[280:36.19]By the way, you only have another couple of days to nominate something.
[280:40.09]So go take a look at the categories in the Discord channel.
[280:42.81]I would do that if I were you, if you want to participate.
[280:51.83]And I will be back on Thursday late afternoon.

[282:51.28]We're going to start Fear 2 on Thursday evening.
[282:58.58]You like that game?
[283:00.86]I've never played it.
[283:01.58]I'm going in.
[283:02.30]I have no idea.
[283:06.15]No clue.
[283:13.09]More community subs?
[283:15.37]They just come in right now?
[283:16.39]They did.

[283:34.42]When are you going to play the leaf blowing game?
[283:40.57]Probably at some point when fear is done.
[283:42.89]What?
[283:43.09]How long is fear 2?
[283:43.81]12 hours or something?
[283:47.65]8 to 12?

[283:54.15]It's 40 hours.
[283:57.13]What?
[284:00.81]No, it's like 10.
[284:01.37]This music works pretty well here.
[284:09.05]Tier 2 is barely 8.
[284:12.74]Yeah, we'll do it in at least one or two streams.
[284:18.08]That was a great outro there.
[284:21.06]Are you done with the Yakuza?
[284:27.11]We'll see.
[284:28.67]We'll see.
[284:30.63]That will be decided somehow.
[284:34.83]I wonder how.
