[00:01.62]Hello, everybody.
[00:02.22]How are you?
[00:03.35]Speak, speak, speak.
[00:04.51]I'm here, I'm here.
[00:09.37]So, today, it's been a night.
[00:15.23]Saw you last night, but seeing you again right now.
[00:19.94]We've got another co-op stream today.
[00:25.74]This one is going to be with some familiar faces.
[00:30.17]Ster.
[00:31.65]And Etalyx.
[00:34.29]The three of us are going to play a game called Tools Up.
[00:38.80]It's like a mix of Overcooked and House Flipper.
[00:43.98]Who knows?
[00:44.44]The game might be good.
[00:45.46]It might not be.
[00:46.44]But it seems like it could be pretty fun.
[00:50.48]We are currently streaming this through Steam Remote Play.
[00:57.88]So this is going to be a journey.
[00:59.04]We took a little extra time to get it ready.
[01:03.30]So, we have tested it.
[01:04.82]It does work.
[01:05.79]But we're ready.
[01:11.71]They're both currently doing their intros.
[01:14.91]Because they're streamers.
[01:19.84]And I'm just sitting here in outer space.
[01:22.92]Show us the hammer.
[01:24.30]What a hammer.
[01:28.71]When is Halo?
[01:32.19]God damn it.
[01:41.17]You know what's really, really awful?
[01:44.37]I feel like I need to wait like a week to play Halo.
[01:48.24]Again.
[01:48.48]I have such a... It's like...
[01:53.30]eating ice cream for the first time, you take a bite of ice cream while somebody stabs a knife into your back.
[02:00.50]You are always going to have synonymous the memory of eating ice cream for the first time with when you got stabbed.
[02:08.66]So I want to play Halo.
[02:10.70]Very, very badly.
[02:17.27]But I got stabbed while we played.
[02:20.05]I got the bad memory.
[02:31.19]Joel scarred him for life.
[02:35.80]Joel hates Jeremiah.
[02:40.18]This is a different co-op stream today.
[02:44.48]This is Tools Up.
[02:47.60]And I wonder...
[02:50.72]Here's the funny thing.
[02:52.65]They know this, and now you're gonna know this, and it's actually kind of funny.
[02:56.31]The way that Steam Remote Play works is I am in total control of both of their streams.
[03:03.38]I am broadcasting this to their computers.
[03:07.86]So, I'm in control.
[03:10.63]They can't press any buttons.
[03:13.01]They can't change any sliders or anything.
[03:15.35]So I'm in the driver's seat.
[03:17.27]So if I just start playing the game right now, if they have their desktop audio enabled, this is going to start playing.
[03:22.04]Let's find out.
[03:27.66]Let's see if anybody said it.
[03:28.98]Did it work?
[03:33.48]It should be playing some music through there.
[03:36.52]I'll mute it.
[03:40.77]Right now, it... Yeah, it is.
[03:43.53]Alright, watch this.
[03:45.53]Yeah, come over here.
[03:46.19]Take a look at this.
[03:53.68]I'm in fucking control!
[03:55.02]Alright, did I fuck up this frame?
[04:14.89]Oh, he was muted.
[04:15.81]Yeah, no, they're both muted right now.
[04:18.09]They're both doing their intros.
[04:19.39]Well, this is Tools Up.
[04:30.22]Or are they both muted desktop audio, and did I just do that to you guys?
[04:36.02]I wonder.
[04:42.26]Yeah, that's probably what it was.
[04:44.61]But, hey, they're muted on stream, but they heard it.
[04:49.03]There's no way they didn't.
[04:51.19]It's impossible.
[04:52.43]They heard that.
[04:52.85]Alright, I'm ready.
[04:57.38]I'm just going to be in the Discord call waiting for them.
[05:00.30]I'm just going to be talking.
[05:01.06]Who are we waiting for?
[05:02.22]Are you here?
[05:02.66]Are you here?
[05:07.43]How's it going, everybody?
[05:08.83]What's going on?
[05:09.75]How's everybody doing?
[05:11.01]Yeah, what's up, man?
[05:12.07]Hey, dude.
[05:12.87]Hey.
[05:13.39]Long time no see.
[05:14.59]How's everybody doing?
[05:15.45]You guys all at the menu?
[05:17.45]How was your Thanksgiving?
[05:19.47]Oh, man.
[05:19.91]What'd you guys get for Black Friday?
[05:21.81]Uh... I got a table.
[05:27.83]You guys can't both talk at once.
[05:29.27]Someone learn how to, like... Oh, my God!
[05:34.05]That's so fucking loud!
[05:36.15]Could you not...
[05:38.67]He's doing it on purpose!
[05:40.85]I'm in fucking control!
[05:42.21]Yeah, Jerma's streaming a game so that we can restream his game.
[05:52.60]No report.
[05:54.96]How do you report a player in Steam?
[05:56.94]Well, you guys will be the ones getting reported because you're streaming my stream.
[06:00.61]Alright, I had to turn you down to like 40% because you just...
[06:04.38]you personally your voice blasted my audio and now you're like quiet as a whisper oh dude we've already played the game for 10 seconds go back to our 10 seconds I don't want to start over alright let's do a new save slot that one's corrupted did you guys explain how this works to everybody I I don't know how this works
[06:28.85]Alright, Jerma is streaming this game to the cloud.
[06:31.75]The magic of the cloud is enabling me and Ster to connect and use our controllers as if we were sitting next to him in the same house.
[06:41.72]Can you imagine being in the same house?
[06:44.04]It's called the internet.
[06:46.33]They just rolled out the internet this week, and they're letting us try it as a beta.
[06:51.73]Yeah.
[06:52.89]But this game is what I'm in.
[06:54.07]I don't know how... I have no idea how this game works.
[06:57.27]Alright, you guys, here comes the cutscene.
[07:00.01]This game requires friends.
[07:02.93]You could be anywhere on Earth.
[07:08.67]That's us.
[07:11.82]How do you know?
[07:12.68]Hey, I'm driving.
[07:13.96]You haven't seen us yet.
[07:15.10]Ooh, nice.
[07:16.40]You almost hit that.
[07:17.40]Okay.
[07:25.99]Oh, yeah.
[07:26.83]Why can't they see the cutscene?
[07:28.79]Wait, they can't see the cutscene?
[07:30.19]Hold on.
[07:30.45]My thing's bugged.
[07:32.91]I'm in control of the cutscene.
[07:34.55]Oh, they can't see it.
[07:35.61]Wait, what?
[07:37.09]Yeah, my stream is also showing the main menu.
[07:40.12]This internet beta is not going well.
[07:42.14]Wait, what?
[07:43.15]Hold on.
[07:43.76]Should I just skip the cutscene?
[07:47.42]Presumably.
[07:48.14]Hold on.
[07:49.66]But it's so cute!
[07:51.90]It's really not.
[07:53.98]Okay, I'm going to skip the cutscene.
[07:56.99]So you guys just have to... I can see it now.
[07:58.23]You guys have to overcooked?
[08:00.37]I untoggled the cap feed and then re-toggled it.
[08:06.13]And that seemed to work.
[08:08.75]Okay, how does it look?
[08:10.92]You guys good?
[08:11.66]We good?
[08:13.85]Who's player two?
[08:14.57]Who just did that?
[08:15.51]I am.
[08:15.85]That's me.
[08:16.81]I am.
[08:17.53]Okay.
[08:18.37]Okay.
[08:19.02]Hold on.
[08:19.46]Because now I can't.
[08:21.90]Okay.
[08:25.00]Okay.
[08:25.80]I'm player three.
[08:27.78]Okay.
[08:29.10]Everyone remember that.
[08:30.90]No one for the rest of any of our streams ask who is who or I'm going to be mad.
[08:38.80]Okay, first one ready.
[08:40.22]Wait, what the heck?
[08:41.58]You just dropped out of the game.
[08:43.08]Um, you hear me pressing?
[08:48.65]Okay, I'm ready.
[08:49.43]Alright, are we ready?
[08:51.37]Yeah, first one ready.
[08:52.25]Let's go.
[08:52.67]Player one's me.
[08:53.35]Player two, Etalyx.
[08:54.21]Player three, star.
[08:55.48]No, I'm player three now.
[08:57.32]What?
[08:59.00]Are you?
[09:00.04]Yeah.
[09:00.98]Oh, you are.
[09:02.46]So no one asked.
[09:04.30]I'm player two.
[09:05.72]I just don't... I'm just... I'm just like the Super Mario guy.
[09:10.08]Alright, I'm going.
[09:13.68]I don't even know... I don't know who you guys are... I don't know.
[09:17.17]I'm Lady.
[09:19.49]Who is player two.
[09:20.95]I've got the hard hat.
[09:22.21]Left stick is Elevator.
[09:24.79]What?
[09:26.31]That's not...
[09:28.72]We have to fix this house.
[09:29.74]Oh, I just walked under a ladder, that's... Oh shit, I did too.
[09:34.65]Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm the one in control.
[09:36.43]Don't, somebody just did something and I'm supposed to be in control.
[09:39.21]It's alright, I'll be alright.
[09:40.15]No, I'm player one.
[09:41.75]Okay.
[09:41.93]So we have to fix the house.
[09:45.85]Overall progress is 0%.
[09:46.71]We're being timed.
[09:47.65]How are we being timed?
[09:49.08]What constitutes as a fixed house?
[09:52.16]Living room.
[09:52.84]The living room needs to be... You're building?
[09:55.79]You didn't tell me there was building.
[09:57.21]No, living room has to... What's that?
[09:58.73]The floor has to be... We're renovating.
[10:00.17]We're trying to make this a nice place to live in.
[10:03.53]Okay.
[10:04.59]Left trigger, right trigger.
[10:06.23]Oh, my God.
[10:06.73]And Jerma controls the camera like a fucking loon.
[10:08.82]No, no, no, no, no.
[10:09.46]Whoever controls the blueprint controls the camera.
[10:11.48]Whoever controls the blueprint has control of the camera.
[10:14.08]But what the hell do we have to do?
[10:15.30]Paint the walls red?
[10:17.28]Okay.
[10:17.72]How do we do that?
[10:18.24]Alright.
[10:19.20]I've got paint.
[10:20.40]Okay.
[10:20.64]I took a door off.
[10:23.11]So it's X to do that, and how do you paint?
[10:24.83]Um, you have to have paints to paint.
[10:29.68]I figured out how to take off doors.
[10:31.24]So how do you pick stuff up?
[10:33.18]We don't even have paint.
[10:35.16]This is paint right here.
[10:36.58]Oh, okay.
[10:37.42]So you... Oh, you guys are already dead.
[10:41.73]I spilled it.
[10:42.51]How do you clean up?
[10:43.77]What do you mean we're dead?
[10:46.13]Alright, well you... How do you recycle?
[10:50.48]What are you doing?
[10:52.50]Why are you riot shielding?
[10:54.88]I'm beating the door.
[10:56.52]Alright.
[10:58.14]Will you go take the blueprint and find... If we don't do this in two minutes... How do we hook the doors up?
[11:03.58]We have 2.7 minutes.
[11:05.06]You press the bottom button?
[11:06.48]I don't know what controller you're using.
[11:08.10]The A on the Xbox.
[11:09.88]You guys have Xbox?
[11:11.40]Yeah.
[11:11.62]I got an Xbox.
[11:13.01]I asked for one for Christmas.
[11:14.85]And I got one.
[11:16.15]Okay.
[11:17.31]This is dumb.
[11:18.76]Oh my god.
[11:19.94]Okay, that's you doing that.
[11:21.00]Oh my god, that's you doing it.
[11:22.86]I'm learning.
[11:23.80]We all had to do it once.
[11:26.08]Okay, so how do I get new paint?
[11:27.32]Where's the tutorial?
[11:28.72]This is the campaign.
[11:29.54]This is the tutorial.
[11:30.74]Listen, this is the kind of game that doesn't hold your hand.
[11:32.66]Are we out of... You need to turn so we can see the other side.
[11:36.85]Why am I holding a milk carton?
[11:38.69]Alright, go.
[11:40.29]Don't let me have these.
[11:41.51]Put that down.
[11:42.91]I'm done.
[11:43.93]We have to paint.
[11:44.97]Okay, okay.
[11:46.05]I have a new idea.
[11:46.95]I'll be the foreman.
[11:48.14]No, what the fuck are we- there's three of us!
[11:50.46]Pick a room!
[11:51.18]Uh, hey, wait, how do you- how do you pick s- Thank you.
[11:55.72]No.
[11:55.96]Okay.
[11:56.78]It's putting me over there.
[11:58.58]This room needs to- no, it's- do we just have to paint the living room?
[12:02.71]When I go up to either of you- But how?
[12:05.29]Stop flipping!
[12:07.11]Yeah, I think we have to flip so we can see the wall.
[12:09.43]Go up to- Star, come here.
[12:10.99]Paint can, hope.
[12:12.84]Hold X on the paint can.
[12:14.62]Which one's the star?
[12:16.96]You don't know who you are?
[12:18.54]What are you talking about?
[12:21.04]Cat, which one's the star?
[12:23.22]You've got a red hat.
[12:24.18]I've got an orange hat.
[12:25.80]And Jerm's got a green Jerm hat.
[12:28.87]Yes.
[12:32.31]We did this.
[12:34.81]X. Hold it.
[12:36.37]This is just a guessing game.
[12:38.23]No, it's not.
[12:39.31]You have red paint.
[12:40.29]Okay, we win.
[12:43.02]Tidy up, get rid of all the trash.
[12:45.92]What about, okay, it says recycle, but what are we recycling?
[12:50.36]How do you throw stuff and pick stuff up?
[12:52.27]My guy refuses.
[12:56.17]Oh, shit.
[12:57.17]Okay, hold on.
[12:57.89]Wait, wait, clean up.
[12:58.39]Clean up, clean up, clean up.
[12:59.57]When I press X on things, he just shakes his head.
[13:01.61]Uh, A throws.
[13:02.81]Pick that paint can up.
[13:04.53]How?
[13:05.39]A, and then use, that's how you throw.
[13:07.97]Why did you kick me out of the house?
[13:10.77]Because no one knows what's happening.
[13:15.12]We still did it.
[13:17.48]Which one of these is you?
[13:19.82]I'm the little guy with the GERMA985 branded helmet on.
[13:23.60]Well, then who's me?
[13:25.04]I don't know.
[13:25.62]I don't remember.
[13:26.06]You gotta switch like five times.
[13:32.80]Look, there are your controls right there.
[13:35.78]They're gone.
[13:37.02]I got a solid state drive.
[13:38.72]There's not enough time to read those controls.
[13:40.52]Alright, let me be the one to help you here.
[13:42.14]A picks up.
[13:43.82]Xbox controls.
[13:45.00]A picks up.
[13:46.38]B throws.
[13:48.62]X holding X. Wait, did you say B?
[13:50.68]Does every option.
[13:52.18]B. Which one's D?
[13:53.18]B as in Barry.
[13:55.20]Do I have D?
[13:55.70]It's right there.
[13:56.48]There's only two buttons in the game.
[13:58.56]Press to pick up.
[13:59.14]Put down.
[13:59.82]Hold to collect.
[14:01.14]Throw with B.
[14:03.26]There are only three buttons.
[14:04.69]There's three buttons.
[14:06.21]Well, now we know what they do.
[14:07.05]What are we supposed to do now?
[14:08.35]Now you... Okay, get the blueprint.
[14:11.97]I can't get out of this, by the way.
[14:13.27]You just can hold me forever.
[14:16.53]He says you're a bully.
[14:23.24]Okay.
[14:24.60]Living room.
[14:25.12]Living room?
[14:26.54]Needs floors.
[14:28.42]Which one's the living room?
[14:31.65]The living room needs walls painted.
[14:33.99]Alright, we gotta clean up the paint.
[14:35.37]We gotta recycle the rubbish.
[14:36.79]We gotta use the buckets to put the rubbish away.
[14:39.17]No, it does need floors.
[14:40.65]Yeah, clean shit up.
[14:42.77]Okay, again, I volunteer.
[14:44.72]What is this one?
[14:46.16]I'll just be the foreman and I'll stand over here and make sure you're all doing it right.
[14:51.06]Alright, pick stuff up and put it in the bucket.
[14:52.92]Just clean.
[14:53.74]Just help us clean.
[14:56.96]No, don't throw it over it out of bounds.
[14:59.02]Listen, I've been playing with Nintendo controllers lately.
[15:02.64]Who the fuck is this guy?
[15:04.32]This carpet guy.
[15:06.49]Oh, he's got the carpet.
[15:08.91]Alright, it goes in this room, right?
[15:10.59]Look, look, look.
[15:11.93]We can really speed this up efficiently.
[15:15.03]I think we have to roll this.
[15:16.96]Are you awake?
[15:18.08]I think he's just not playing.
[15:20.42]I'm playing.
[15:22.48]He's not moving.
[15:23.48]Have you ever been at a construction site before?
[15:26.00]Alright, look, look, look.
[15:28.46]We're going to speed this up.
[15:29.40]Pick that up.
[15:30.72]It's desperately telling you.
[15:31.98]What?
[15:34.00]What?
[15:36.93]I can't.
[15:38.12]No, I can't.
[15:39.32]I can't.
[15:40.06]Yep, they're still doing it.
[15:44.12]You totally can't.
[15:45.80]That's what this is here for.
[15:46.88]Put that down.
[15:50.65]Which one's the living room and which one's the kitchen?
[15:53.19]Put the bucket down.
[15:54.03]Yep, they're still doing it.
[16:02.20]Okay.
[16:03.10]You're stepping in your own dog poop.
[16:07.48]We have two minutes to figure this out.
[16:11.56]That's not a lot of time.
[16:13.16]I'm going to be the foreman now.
[16:14.76]Yes, the carpet needs to be rolled in this room.
[16:17.82]Just look at small Luigi Wario.
[16:20.36]Okay, Etalyx is a shitty foreman.
[16:22.74]Okay, I'm sorry.
[16:23.70]I just had to get that out of my system.
[16:25.00]Alright.
[16:27.88]Okay, we have a carpet now.
[16:30.18]How do we roll this?
[16:34.22]I think, do we need help?
[16:35.42]So you can order stuff.
[16:36.84]Oh, here we go.
[16:37.32]Alright, uh... You can see progress.
[16:41.50]We're 5% done in the living room.
[16:43.26]Take... Take... Oh my god.
[16:45.76]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[16:46.54]Put it down.
[16:47.14]You can't tell what's happening when you're blueprinting us, you stupid, shitty foreman.
[16:51.38]Bathroom... That's what we were dealing with.
[16:53.14]Put carpets in the bathroom.
[16:55.55]Cowards.
[16:56.15]Why is...
[16:57.81]Why is my character just shaking her head no?
[16:59.71]Because you're standing on the square, you're supposed to be silent.
[17:02.66]Because someone has to tell you no.
[17:05.00]Well, don't you have to stand on it to put it down?
[17:06.98]I can't not stand on it.
[17:10.54]What button?
[17:11.00]Alright, what color do the rooms need to be?
[17:15.96]Does one need to be orange?
[17:18.34]Okay, I'll be the foreman.
[17:23.66]Okay, the kitchen.
[17:25.68]It just tells you what needs to happen.
[17:27.30]Okay, so this should be orange.
[17:28.45]Kitchen needs to be painted.
[17:30.69]Orange.
[17:31.69]The living room needs to be yellow.
[17:34.71]How do you tell what room is what?
[17:37.77]So the living room is done, right?
[17:39.45]Yeah.
[17:40.17]No, it needs to be orange.
[17:40.99]Walls in the living room, too?
[17:42.16]Ugly.
[17:42.56]Oh, shit.
[17:44.14]Yellow walls?
[17:45.44]Yellow walls on the right, orange on the top.
[17:47.74]I'm doing the orange on the top.
[17:49.52]I spilled it.
[17:50.26]What kind of fucking McDonald's playpen house is this?
[17:54.71]I haven't learned the buttons yet.
[17:59.91]Can someone clean this up?
[18:02.61]Play Prowse.
[18:07.08]You're doing a great job, Star, walking back and forth from room to room.
[18:10.96]You're doing great.
[18:11.90]It's good.
[18:13.02]Now hold X and then hold X. I'm doing it, Daddy.
[18:19.03]How come you can only paint once per...
[18:23.08]Because it's part of the video game.
[18:24.56]Alright, now can a foreman turn?
[18:27.32]Oh, we got seven seconds.
[18:29.34]What?
[18:29.78]What?
[18:30.14]We're 89%.
[18:31.68]Clean it up.
[18:32.12]Just clean it up.
[18:32.64]There's no carpet there.
[18:34.06]How is there no carpet in that corner?
[18:35.96]We did it.
[18:37.36]One star.
[18:37.68]It was placed in blocks.
[18:40.64]That doesn't make any sense.
[18:43.06]That does actually not make any sense.
[18:46.65]But, you ever heard of malicious compliance?
[18:51.24]no just put it down who cares somebody else's problem though oh yeah yeah that's my life let them put it together we'll just leave the paint cans there the carpet he's a redditor shut up found out you've got 10 stars on that last one yeah if you multiply by 10. I think I learned the buttons
[19:22.13]I scared everybody.
[19:23.07]I'm sorry.
[19:25.99]Let me go.
[19:27.11]I'm trying to shortcut you.
[19:29.19]Oh, that's actually pretty good.
[19:31.23]Listen to me, everybody.
[19:32.71]In the living room, we got to put down the floor.
[19:34.81]But first, you have to use the gardening tool on it.
[19:40.65]The floor has to come in first through the mail.
[19:42.93]And then you have to paint the wall orange.
[19:45.88]What do we have to do?
[19:47.08]Okay, so we need Binding of Isaac damage plus what?
[19:51.46]No, that's like the gardener.
[19:54.04]You have to dig up something to plant.
[20:02.88]Okay, the bucket is definitely supposed to hold like excess.
[20:05.56]Yeah, it's trash.
[20:06.16]Yeah, it does.
[20:06.92]It holds trash.
[20:08.68]But how do you put it in there?
[20:12.75]Here, put it down.
[20:13.31]It's A to put it down.
[20:15.83]Alright, alright, alright.
[20:19.43]Alright, here's the carpet.
[20:20.77]We haven't finished moving this.
[20:24.05]Here, here, here, here.
[20:24.71]Yeah, there, see?
[20:26.05]Let's get it going.
[20:27.27]Let's get it going, boys.
[20:28.04]It's A to put trash in here.
[20:30.96]Look how fast this is.
[20:32.08]Oh, that is pretty fast.
[20:33.14]Alright, so this wall needs to be orange, right?
[20:36.10]Uh, no.
[20:36.56]No.
[20:37.24]No.
[20:38.28]Not orange.
[20:38.88]That's... Okay, hold on.
[20:40.38]This one's orange.
[20:42.12]I think so, yeah.
[20:43.12]Where'd the carpet guy go?
[20:44.54]Well, it depends.
[20:45.40]Which one is the kitchen and which one's the living room?
[20:47.14]Hang on.
[20:47.34]There he is.
[20:48.71]Get the carpet.
[20:49.11]Does he have to answer the door?
[20:51.33]He's ringing the doorbell.
[20:55.73]Is he gonna help?
[20:56.37]Okay.
[20:57.43]I'll be painter.
[20:58.05]Is he gonna do it?
[20:58.95]He was about to leave again.
[21:02.55]Thank you.
[21:02.83]That actually helped.
[21:04.83]I'm... I'm the foreman.
[21:06.80]Alright, there's yellow paint coming in.
[21:08.64]Yellow paint just arrived.
[21:09.84]Alright, this room's done.
[21:13.05]I'm bringing you the yellow paint.
[21:15.03]Okay, good.
[21:15.81]Alright, I'm getting the carpet.
[21:18.59]Thank you.
[21:20.23]We have to designate jobs.
[21:21.43]That's how this works.
[21:22.87]Well, I mean, we're doing that kind of already.
[21:25.37]I can't paint this room.
[21:27.07]I'm willing to bet we get paid by the hour.
[21:31.43]Which room has to be yellow?
[21:33.48]The top left one.
[21:34.30]Okay.
[21:36.04]Hey, but furniture delivery gets paid ahead of time.
[21:39.52]Oh, you gotta peel the wallpaper off.
[21:41.32]Shit.
[21:41.68]Alright, I need that bucket.
[21:42.40]Throw that bucket in here.
[21:43.95]I'm getting it.
[21:47.85]Alright, I got the carpet done in the main room.
[21:50.55]I need that trash bucket.
[21:52.01]I painted all the walls.
[21:53.76]Alright, put it down.
[21:55.68]We have to peel the walls off.
[21:59.06]Metallica, get on it!
[22:03.01]I am already on it.
[22:04.35]He's already here.
[22:06.25]Get on it.
[22:06.81]Alright, get on that.
[22:08.19]You're already going.
[22:09.05]You're in the room doing the job.
[22:12.87]When you do that, it changes our controls.
[22:14.91]Just to let you... Please don't do that.
[22:16.93]I'm doing it so that you can get the walls you haven't gotten.
[22:20.33]I'm doing it intelligently.
[22:22.87]What about this one?
[22:23.59]You know nothing about.
[22:24.57]Go this way.
[22:26.25]Hey.
[22:27.51]Hey.
[22:29.76]wow you spilled it everywhere it's alright it'll take two seconds to clean it up dude I really I didn't learn the buttons yet I think I figured it out I got it I I need to be very real here how how is it possible that you don't understand x and a dude what this every time I go to do something I press the wrong one
[22:55.49]Well, it's just, it's A to pick up, X to interact.
[22:58.91]It's A, pick up, X, interact.
[23:01.93]I mean, even I can figure that out.
[23:05.46]You're really downplaying yourself there.
[23:07.32]You went to college.
[23:08.20]Alright, we need to, we got 91%.
[23:09.56]What are we missing?
[23:11.46]Of course you would know how to do that.
[23:14.94]The right wall, the right wall.
[23:16.02]Get the paint bucket.
[23:17.13]Right wall.
[23:17.63]No, the right, something wrong with the right wall.
[23:19.01]No, get out of, get my, I want to fucking get the glory.
[23:23.33]Ow.
[23:24.49]Oops, wrong way.
[23:25.55]Right wall?
[23:27.43]No, we're good.
[23:28.79]So what's wrong?
[23:29.55]We're missing the kitchen.
[23:30.59]The kitchen's all messed up.
[23:32.86]It's the walls.
[23:33.58]We need to peel the paper or something.
[23:36.10]What?
[23:37.06]Is it... See how it's not yellow?
[23:40.12]Are we missing something?
[23:41.16]Spin it around.
[23:41.54]And the floor's not yellow.
[23:43.63]Spin the walls?
[23:44.67]Wait!
[23:44.99]Oh, shit!
[23:45.57]What the hell's... What?
[23:47.55]What?
[23:49.40]Oh, shit!
[23:50.06]Oh, they looked yellow!
[23:51.71]They looked yellow!
[23:52.77]They looked yellow!
[23:54.37]I'm with you.
[23:55.29]The people who... They're just gonna have to pass.
[24:00.15]Look.
[24:00.73]They're the ones that wanted to die under 120 seconds.
[24:03.66]I think that's a little extreme.
[24:09.04]Damn.
[24:12.21]One star Redditor.
[24:13.75]Hey, when are we gonna get our first three star review on Yelp?
[24:16.99]Not until Star figures out how to press X and A. Separately.
[24:20.27]I'm learning.
[24:24.00]You feel like this should be on a 3D plane, but it's not.
[24:26.18]It's just left and right.
[24:28.86]We gotta go in the elevator.
[24:29.48]I mean, you technically can go forward and back, it's just... Alright, I'm going in.
[24:34.16]You need six stars to reach this floor.
[24:37.52]What?
[24:38.42]Are we getting Mario 64'd right now?
[24:40.78]Yeah.
[24:41.26]We didn't do good enough.
[24:42.72]Get good.
[24:43.32]You one-starred all three of the first levels.
[24:45.71]No, we didn't.
[24:46.51]We go.
[24:46.95]Yeah, we did.
[24:47.77]No, we only got one star on every level.
[24:49.37]We only got a single star.
[24:51.49]Oh, no.
[24:52.53]But you know what?
[24:53.23]In this day and age, that means we're willing to work for the least amount of money.
[24:56.95]Alright.
[24:57.33]I'm on trash.
[24:58.19]I'm on trash.
[24:58.67]I'm on trash.
[24:59.09]Do something else.
[24:59.51]I'm on trash.
[24:59.87]Get out of the way.
[25:01.35]Oh, my God.
[25:02.17]What?
[25:04.74]Okay, I'll be the foreman.
[25:06.35]Get that in there.
[25:07.11]I'm on trash.
[25:09.47]Which butt is it?
[25:11.25]How do you not know the butt?
[25:12.95]Okay, are you alright?
[25:15.85]Have you eaten today?
[25:16.73]Yes.
[25:18.33]Alright, I'm the foreman.
[25:20.43]We need yellow walls right, orange walls top.
[25:25.04]Is there any more trash?
[25:30.94]No more trash.
[25:31.58]Okay, I'm emptying this.
[25:35.32]Are you high?
[25:36.78]Did you, like, smoke weed like an hour ago?
[25:40.84]No, no, I wouldn't do that.
[25:42.34]Oh, weed jokes.
[25:44.46]Okay, you guys, are you guys seeing what's going on here?
[25:48.80]Alright, good.
[25:49.16]I'm getting the carpet.
[25:51.45]Carpet.
[25:52.21]Ding dong.
[25:55.77]Are we ready for carpet to go in the room?
[25:57.73]Which button's the carpet?
[25:59.81]Pay no attention here.
[26:00.45]I need two more walls.
[26:02.17]I'll just start doing carpet.
[26:04.80]Alright, walls should be done.
[26:10.06]We also need to make sure that it actually goes all the way.
[26:12.08]I know what happened.
[26:14.18]Somebody went like this last time.
[26:16.55]That's what happened.
[26:18.59]Oh, that was 100% me.
[26:19.61]I can't select the carpet.
[26:22.57]Somebody went like what?
[26:24.50]If you don't hold it all the way, if you don't have enough carpet to do the whole place, it doesn't... You'll miss a spot.
[26:30.16]Everyone loves holding the button.
[26:31.52]You know like in No Man's Sky, you have to hold the button for every menu.
[26:34.92]Like, oh, I want to change my brightness.
[26:36.56]Hold the... Yeah.
[26:38.54]Actually, I agree with you.
[26:39.31]I disagree.
[26:39.91]I do agree with you.
[26:40.87]It should just be one input.
[26:41.75]Alright.
[26:42.07]Tidy up.
[26:42.57]That's three stars.
[26:43.63]Let's go.
[26:44.81]Who is who?
[26:45.65]I said no one asked.
[26:47.03]It builds finger strength passively.
[26:51.28]Might be throwing away all this carpet.
[26:53.38]Tidy up, four left.
[26:57.23]303, oop, that's it.
[26:58.95]Oh shit, clean that up.
[27:00.63]How come there's like a Cheeto puff coming out of this can?
[27:04.59]That's it, right?
[27:05.05]You have to tidy up, close the door.
[27:06.17]Oh, that's the carpet.
[27:08.55]One left.
[27:10.25]Yeah, it's... I'm fucking stun locked over here, please.
[27:15.42]Got it.
[27:19.02]We unlocked a new character.
[27:21.03]I want to be Otter Boy!
[27:22.13]Alright.
[27:27.42]When I asked my chat what kind of gay animal I was, they said I was an otter.
[27:31.94]How do I change?
[27:33.98]What's wrong with you?
[27:41.71]Okay, now everyone won't mistake that I am the otter.
[27:45.93]What are you talking about?
[27:47.53]Okay, okay, are we ready?
[27:56.93]Do we have enough stars to go upstairs?
[27:59.33]No, we have three and one and one.
[28:01.33]So what is that?
[28:03.23]How many does that add up to?
[28:08.01]I can't... Where am I?
[28:10.53]Three and one and one.
[28:12.07]Three, four, five, six.
[28:13.39]Oh, we do have six.
[28:15.13]Let's go.
[28:16.93]What are you guys doing?
[28:18.97]Ooh, that was solid.
[28:20.11]We're going up.
[28:25.54]Why did it go back down?
[28:26.94]Going up.
[28:28.39]Because apparently we all have control of it.
[28:30.11]Alright.
[28:31.71]Press down.
[28:32.17]Alright.
[28:33.41]We got to get a three star on this one.
[28:36.11]Okay.
[28:36.29]So it's A to press up or put down.
[28:39.47]Yeah.
[28:40.17]Hold on.
[28:40.55]Hold on.
[28:42.50]We have to dump cement or shellac, whatever it is, into a bucket, and then we shellac the walls.
[28:50.66]Yeah.
[28:50.92]Stick the circuit boards in there.
[28:53.32]Put your fork directly into the socket.
[28:55.36]Open the door!
[28:56.06]Oh, do you know what button it was?
[28:58.59]Yeah, talk shit, get hit.
[29:01.23]Uh, I just didn't push the button at all.
[29:02.95]Okay, here's the... So we go... So shellac into the bucket, and then... Hang on, do you want to look at the plans first?
[29:10.41]Whatever, we know what we're doing.
[29:13.16]Yeah, shellac.
[29:14.16]Okay.
[29:14.42]Okay.
[29:14.84]Uh, because it's orange, left, yellow top.
[29:19.80]Yeah, but we gotta shellac first to get rid of this brick.
[29:24.96]Okay, I refilled the shellac.
[29:30.03]Delivery.
[29:30.97]I got it.
[29:32.87]Uh, do you?
[29:34.85]Yo, what's this house?
[29:35.99]Why is he sprinting away?
[29:37.17]Is this the neighbor?
[29:39.35]Do we steal our neighbor's fucking sherbert?
[29:42.55]What is the... I don't understand.
[29:45.33]Yo.
[29:47.11]What's in the ice cooler?
[29:51.63]What walls have to be orange?
[29:54.61]These ones?
[29:55.08]Top right is yellow.
[29:58.10]And then left is orange.
[30:01.44]Is it?
[30:02.58]Yeah.
[30:03.66]Look at the walls.
[30:04.57]Hang on.
[30:05.11]We missed a spot.
[30:07.01]I have to steal more ice cream from my neighbor.
[30:09.95]Alright, you get it.
[30:13.16]Fixed it.
[30:14.88]I need that trash bag.
[30:17.05]Just grab it out of his hand.
[30:17.83]I missed two spots up here.
[30:18.99]Embarrassing.
[30:20.17]There might even be more.
[30:20.93]I can't see because the person left the blueprints all the way outside the house.
[30:26.45]They're saying we fucked it.
[30:27.41]You fucked it.
[30:27.93]You fucked it.
[30:28.43]What?
[30:29.01]What happened?
[30:34.02]Alright, I'm doing some rotations.
[30:35.84]Hold your pants.
[30:45.03]I'm going.
[30:46.51]Why did they deliver to the wrong address?
[30:48.37]I don't know.
[30:51.30]Maybe that is the... Why would... This is... I have no idea.
[30:54.14]I think this is the second house.
[30:56.02]We're making over the wrong house.
[31:00.50]These people are just like on vacation.
[31:04.26]It's yellow carpet in here, right?
[31:05.42]I hope so.
[31:08.16]Alright, where's... I need this to be... I don't know.
[31:10.31]Where's the trash?
[31:11.81]We also need to kind of have to rotate.
[31:14.99]Paint orange in here.
[31:16.53]Orange?
[31:16.87]Yeah.
[31:17.85]Just make sure I shellacked okay.
[31:23.79]We'll just paint over it.
[31:24.47]They won't even know.
[31:31.33]The people that are going to know, the people that own this house 30 years from now, they're going to peel back three layers of wallpaper.
[31:37.28]Yes, and underneath it, I will have signed my name.
[31:40.62]And then...
[31:42.59]Then they'll find the bones in the basement.
[31:46.81]I somehow knew that's where that was going.
[31:49.54]I knew that's where that was going.
[31:50.52]Alright, how we doing?
[31:52.04]I'm flipping you.
[31:53.32]That's a better view.
[31:55.32]Alright, we need the, uh, we need carpet over here.
[31:58.66]Yep.
[31:59.96]No.
[32:00.28]We need carpet in here.
[32:02.86]Yeah, no, no, no, no.
[32:03.40]Carpet's already here.
[32:04.64]What's missing from the, what's missing from the living room?
[32:09.08]Uh, there probably is one wall.
[32:11.26]There's one wall that's fucked up.
[32:12.50]It's one you're, it's right in front of you.
[32:14.13]This one here.
[32:16.75]I got it.
[32:17.23]Oh, I got it.
[32:18.03]I got it.
[32:18.57]Don't worry, don't even worry about it.
[32:20.53]I got that.
[32:23.29]Man, I wish it would individually score us so you could see how good I'm doing.
[32:26.40]Wrong color.
[32:27.26]Wrong.
[32:27.94]Wrong.
[32:29.32]Well, paint over it.
[32:30.84]Paint over it.
[32:31.44]Can I say I've got that three times and then you just let me fucking get it?
[32:35.96]I was... I know.
[32:37.32]I did just... We were just playing baseball and I was the center fielder.
[32:39.08]How do you treat the color off?
[32:39.70]Because I can't just repaint it.
[32:41.36]You called the ball and I just fucking ran in front of you and tried to get it and we smashed into each other and it's a highlight reel on ESPN.
[32:46.63]I know.
[32:46.89]I understand.
[32:47.31]Just fix it.
[32:50.51]That's it.
[32:51.39]You're welcome.
[32:51.85]The clones are going to be you.
[32:54.76]So what is this, like, uh, what's the ice cream bucket for?
[32:59.14]Ah, that was the shellac.
[33:00.98]Oh.
[33:02.06]Those fucking bones.
[33:05.50]Steal the bathtub.
[33:06.60]I didn't say we had to do anything about the bathtub.
[33:11.49]Alright, there's only one thing left.
[33:13.11]What is it?
[33:14.09]Spin us.
[33:15.19]Two left.
[33:16.35]Gotta shut all the doors.
[33:17.39]Three stars.
[33:19.65]God, I'm working with amateurs.
[33:22.67]Really?
[33:22.95]Because you just figured out how to use the buttons this level.
[33:25.27]This otter needs a bear.
[33:34.67]How do you delete somebody else's entire Twitch account?
[33:40.33]I'm working on it.
[33:41.84]Wait, did I just pick the wrong... Same one.
[33:44.70]It's the same one.
[33:46.74]Quit to desktop.
[33:48.48]No, that would be bad.
[33:49.32]That would kill three games at once.
[33:51.53]That would kill three different streams.
[33:55.07]I'm shocked that Cox is holding this load on its back.
[33:59.83]I know, seriously.
[34:01.23]I can't believe it.
[34:04.30]Now, who wants to do what?

[37:29.31]No, we have to shellac the floor.
[37:30.63]Here, take the bucket.
[37:32.15]See, Etalyx, you can't get this out of your hand.
[37:35.15]How do you get it out of your hand?
[37:37.09]Okay, put A into the bucket.
[37:41.58]Is the recycling full?
[37:45.22]No, there's shellac in that bucket.
[37:46.84]I can't walk over there.
[37:48.22]Alright.
[37:51.24]No, stop.
[37:51.92]Somebody get the door.
[37:52.82]I got it.
[37:55.35]We all run over to get the fucking door.
[38:00.53]I'm gonna shellac you in a second.
[38:02.17]Okay, so keep in mind, when you shellac, you can't walk on it for like 10 seconds.
[38:10.21]Why'd you throw everything in here?
[38:11.95]God!
[38:13.61]Okay, why is, why are the tiles up in the top row?
[38:16.01]Because he's been, he's throwing them!
[38:17.45]Alright, here's what we gotta do.
[38:19.61]We gotta, you gotta tile... Corner out.
[38:21.41]I didn't throw the top... Corner out, you can't walk on that.
[38:27.98]Are you picking this up from me?
[38:30.63]No, no, no.
[38:31.37]You have to shellac the ground and you can't walk on the floor until it's done.
[38:33.83]I know.
[38:35.50]I'm being very patient.
[38:36.72]I'm just going to watch you guys.
[38:37.68]40 seconds.
[38:40.70]I can't put this down.
[38:42.78]Oh, fuck.
[38:43.22]Don't do that.
[38:44.86]It was the only place.
[38:46.80]Okay.
[38:47.56]Thanks.
[38:48.00]Why is it in here?
[38:49.16]Why does everything get blamed on me, but it's all Etalyx?
[38:52.37]Alright, I can't move.
[38:53.03]Somebody has to do this.
[38:55.45]Because you did it first.
[39:00.76]I just like fell down in real life.
[39:05.08]I control it.
[39:05.79]You fell in real life.
[39:07.09]I like flipped and I tripped.
[39:10.55]My control unplugged.
[39:12.35]Alright.
[39:12.85]No, God damn it.
[39:17.01]We got eight seconds.
[39:18.69]This is bad news.
[39:20.93]We can do this one.
[39:21.71]There was a new game mechanic.
[39:23.04]How are we supposed to know?
[39:26.78]Wow.
[39:27.94]That's a zero star.
[39:30.38]I mean, you're only as strong as your weakest link.
[39:32.20]I was last to fall.
[39:34.10]I wish they individually scored us.
[39:35.82]Go.
[39:37.46]That way I could prove.
[39:38.52]Listen, you ever heard he who smelted dealt it?
[39:42.52]You are protesting quite a lot right now.
[39:44.59]Unprovoked.
[39:46.07]Pick a room.
[39:46.51]Pick a room.
[39:46.91]Everybody pick a room.
[39:47.47]Pick a room.
[39:52.83]I'm just trying to do my job and Alex is talking about fart.
[39:56.01]I'm in this room already.
[39:57.25]Did you not hear what I just said out loud in front of like 60,000 people?
[40:03.28]Hey, who's player one?
[40:03.94]What button is it?
[40:08.16]Okay, I need that back.
[40:09.95]Toss that over here.
[40:12.21]Thank you.
[40:19.10]Uh, is that couch actually supposed to come out?
[40:22.75]Probably, because it makes it easier.
[40:24.87]No, it's not.
[40:31.03]I mean, it would make it easier.
[40:32.15]Yeah, I think we just have to move it out of the way.
[40:37.36]Alright, somebody help me move the couch out of the way.
[40:41.44]There you go.
[40:42.58]There you go.
[40:44.10]Alright.
[40:45.80]Now we shellac.
[40:46.43]There you go.
[40:49.36]I will dump this bucket.
[40:53.44]He walked right in front when I was picking it up.
[40:56.20]Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[40:57.86]I don't know what to do.
[40:58.56]Wait, this isn't realistic.
[40:59.56]It's not going... When you drag it.
[41:03.68]That's because as good movers, we already put the little cushions underneath each leg.
[41:11.15]I don't know what to do.
[41:12.21]Someone give me a task.
[41:13.97]You're only as strong as your weakest link here in this house.
[41:21.56]You have to shellac these walls.
[41:24.24]With the bucket of shellac.
[41:25.96]No, you don't.
[41:26.30]That's a lie.
[41:27.56]I lied.
[41:27.76]You have to do that in the other room.
[41:29.30]Down here.
[41:29.90]No, no, no.
[41:30.24]That's also a lie.
[41:31.00]Yeah, do this.
[41:31.58]In here.
[41:32.76]Shellac the floor.
[41:34.20]Shellac the floor.
[41:35.38]Use this bucket.
[41:36.72]Okay, well do it in an order that we don't have to walk.
[41:42.08]I need that paint.
[41:44.00]Door.
[41:45.23]Metallics, door.
[41:46.15]Metallics.
[41:51.71]I can't move.
[41:52.65]Thank you.
[41:52.93]That was a fucking... That was a good play.
[41:57.23]I locked you.
[41:58.19]I locked you out.
[41:58.63]You did.
[41:58.79]You locked me out.
[42:00.05]I'm being, um... I'm being hampered.
[42:03.23]Sometimes it has to happen.
[42:05.67]Okay, we're totally shellacked in here.
[42:07.71]There's a traitor amongst us.
[42:09.09]Pick up the shellack.
[42:09.55]It's time to shellack.
[42:10.35]He probably works for a rival moving company.
[42:13.70]Oh my god, I do.
[42:16.94]I took you.
[42:17.56]Hey, what are you doing here?
[42:19.56]Five missions to figure it out!
[42:24.01]Did the delivery guy just throw that, or did you throw that?
[42:26.71]He walked into it and then moved it.
[42:29.11]Okay, we've got this paint that needs to come in here.
[42:31.53]Alright, this couch can stay.
[42:33.78]Alright, carpet is done.
[42:34.86]Pink paint needs to go up on the walls.
[42:36.58]Carpet done?
[42:38.06]Yep.
[42:40.60]I'll get this out of here.
[42:45.10]Pink paint, and then we gotta tile this floor.
[42:47.33]Alright, tiling is gonna come last.
[42:53.87]What about the orange paint?
[42:55.01]Did you guys already do that?
[42:56.73]I got orange in the left room.
[42:58.65]Let me check the blueprint.
[42:59.85]And I got pink in the top room.
[43:03.53]Just the living room.
[43:04.63]That's it.
[43:05.79]Living room.
[43:07.15]We got to tile this room.
[43:09.27]I didn't know that I couldn't walk over the tile.
[43:11.17]I completed it.
[43:12.67]We're good.
[43:13.27]Tidy up.
[43:14.19]Start taking things outdoors.
[43:15.71]I got the tile.
[43:22.00]We got to move the couch back, don't we?
[43:24.34]Oh, I think it should be fine.
[43:28.08]It's in.
[43:28.40]Move, move, move, move, move, move, move.
[43:29.94]Where's the... Get him in the same room.
[43:35.77]You're walking pretty far to do that.
[43:39.29]Now you can't get out.
[43:39.97]It's a 200 IQ play because we did two at the same time.
[43:42.87]Yeah, but now he can't leave.
[43:43.79]Shut that door, Alex.
[43:45.29]Yeah, see, I got to shut the door anyway.
[43:46.41]That's what I'm saying.
[43:47.90]Now he can't leave.
[43:48.40]Now I can leave.
[43:49.84]He can't leave.
[43:50.50]He did it from the wrong side.
[43:53.13]I didn't do that.
[43:54.93]Who did that?
[43:57.09]What?
[43:59.25]Wait, you left the tiles.
[44:01.55]No, it's not worth it.
[44:03.69]Throw it out.
[44:13.29]Almost.
[44:13.69]That was close.
[44:15.75]Look at my whiskers.
[44:17.01]Can we go up the next floor?
[44:18.01]Are we allowed to go up yet?
[44:25.00]I knew that was the first thing I knew was going to happen.
[44:29.11]I'm supposed to be in control right now.
[44:30.45]It's not fair.
[44:32.15]Oh, wow.
[44:32.43]We all got an achievement unlocked, except only Jerma gets it.
[44:36.23]The greedy guy that he is.
[44:37.79]I think we just broke the game.
[44:38.73]I don't think we're supposed to be up here.
[44:40.03]It says you need 15 stars to be allowed up here.
[44:41.85]Maybe we have exactly 15 stars to be up here.
[44:44.82]We're doing great.
[44:47.62]Oh, boy.
[44:48.20]Alright.
[44:48.54]Why are they delivering to us in a moat?
[44:53.34]This...
[44:54.49]yeah there's uh all that stuff is ruined stuff coming down the river oh man this is getting to the point where you have to like try isn't it all these sweaty try hard we have to try now wait what did I just I just wanted a relaxing game where I could chat with my friends and they have to turn it into like an exercise you know games are supposed to be like enjoyable it's funny coming from the esports player who's that
[45:26.17]Oh, I accidentally pressed the wrong button and now I have this handful of paint that I can't do anything about until the paint comes around again.
[45:33.47]Alright, what room do we start in?
[45:38.44]Imagine your house is made out of grass.
[45:40.38]Alright, we should probably just restart right now.
[45:43.08]This room sucks.
[45:44.70]This is the ugliest fucking room I've ever seen.
[45:46.14]We don't have a single tool.
[45:51.28]Alright, restart it.
[45:52.26]Restart it.
[45:52.92]Restart it.
[45:53.98]No!
[45:54.08]You try hard!
[45:56.66]We've been sitting around for a full minute.
[46:00.18]I was doing shit.
[46:01.28]Alright, I have saved.
[46:10.09]I just made a second pile.
[46:15.33]Okay, trash, trash, trash, trash, trash, trash, trash.
[46:21.74]We gotta shellac this room.
[46:23.20]You gotta...
[46:25.01]You gotta put a carpet in that room.
[46:26.83]Which room, um... Hang on, we got more stuff coming down the pipe.
[46:30.35]Bring some deliveries out here.
[46:32.35]Alright, house is clean.
[46:34.85]We gotta shellac this patio.
[46:36.87]Shellac the patio, you got it, let's go.
[46:38.69]Tear it up.
[46:39.63]Which room needs to be yellow?
[46:42.24]Or orange?
[46:44.14]This one?
[46:44.72]This one, which also needs to be shellac.
[46:46.80]I can't get through the carpet.
[46:48.65]I don't like this shellacking mechanic right now, I gotta say.
[46:51.93]Well, it's only going to get harder from here, so I... You can see this is... What did you do?
[46:56.85]Okay, well... Hey, could you open the door for me, please?
[47:00.28]This is mine.
[47:00.64]And this one?
[47:03.38]Thank you.
[47:05.80]So what goes on the patio?
[47:07.14]The tiles?
[47:08.36]Have they been delivered by the moat yet, or no?
[47:13.92]Do tiles last.
[47:15.10]Go up there.
[47:15.82]Hopes.
[47:18.17]Delete the ladder!
[47:26.82]Make him suffer!
[47:28.58]Okay, what button is it?
[47:30.04]Alright, we need to turn this.
[47:36.59]Well, there's secret carpet in here.
[47:40.21]There's still a couple things I need to throw in that bucket.
[47:45.01]Okay, well, do it.
[47:47.23]Where does the carpet go?
[47:49.21]I think the carpet goes on the patio, where the pool is.
[47:54.56]Living room, kitchen, bedroom.
[47:55.68]Patio carpet.
[47:57.18]I think it's actually patio carpet.
[48:00.36]How do I shellac these?
[48:01.84]What?
[48:02.93]No, you just have to pull them up.
[48:05.27]Now, okay.
[48:06.35]The shellac is for another room.
[48:08.75]Okay.
[48:11.15]I'm losing it, dude.
[48:13.94]The kitchen needs to have orange paint.
[48:17.48]It needs to be shellacked in orange paint.
[48:19.01]I will go start that process.
[48:24.69]I believe this is the kitchen.
[48:25.69]This is not the kitchen.
[48:29.39]There's one more.
[48:32.55]You got it.
[48:32.94]Alright, I'm going to take a look at the plans.
[48:38.54]The kitchen needs to be shellacked.
[48:40.06]We need to hit these walls...
[48:43.86]with paste paste does that mean this room's walls are not supposed to be painted or that one more alright we got a bunch of empty blue walls in that uh bottom right wait what room am I standing in right now what is it was this is this the bedroom what is this what is this
[49:05.12]It's a blue room.
[49:06.58]What if I told you that any room could be any room, depending on what furniture you put in?
[49:10.76]Oh, I accidentally brought all the stuff into this room.
[49:15.32]Sorry.
[49:15.54]Metallics is the kind of guy to put carpet on a patio.
[49:23.18]We gotta shellac this wall.
[49:24.60]Shellac.
[49:25.94]Here.
[49:27.40]You have to fill the shellac bucket.
[49:30.36]So we're done with the orange paint, right?
[49:31.49]I'm gonna start cleaning up.
[49:34.97]Okay, we got a minute 50.
[49:37.35]That's fine.
[49:39.09]How do I... Okay, you filled it up.
[49:42.15]Good job.
[49:43.63]Now we paste.
[49:44.01]I'm going to check the blueprint, make sure we didn't miss anything in any of these other rooms.
[49:49.66]The kitchen is at 0%, by the way.
[49:52.72]How is that possible?
[49:53.72]Hey, can you improve your upload speed a little?
[49:56.60]Why, is my upload speed bad?
[49:58.74]No, it's just like... I think it's just that screen.
[50:02.86]It's just being mean.
[50:04.85]I was getting, like, 480p for a second.
[50:08.52]Can you make your, like... Can you make our internet better?
[50:17.56]Alright, what do we need to do?
[50:18.52]That's not... Yellow wall.
[50:21.24]Is it yellow?
[50:21.68]No, it's orange.
[50:22.49]Just paint.
[50:24.57]Yeah.
[50:26.63]Yeah, every time you do the blueprint screen, to me, it's like taking on or putting off glasses.
[50:31.71]Putting on, taking off glasses.
[50:33.98]Yeah, putting on, taking off.
[50:35.76]This wall needs it.
[50:37.16]Where the otter's spinning.
[50:40.11]Are we done?
[50:40.51]That's it.
[50:42.91]Tidy up.
[50:44.05]And you thought this one was going to be hard.
[50:45.17]We had plenty of time.
[50:45.85]This one was an easier one.
[50:46.71]They were all in the river.
[50:47.71]Would they know?
[50:48.15]I think they know.
[50:51.19]Do they know?
[50:53.09]Four left.
[50:54.55]It comes around to the side.
[50:55.71]Go up top left.
[50:57.09]Top right.
[50:57.63]Go top right.
[50:58.73]Bottom right.
[50:59.65]What?
[51:00.41]What?
[51:01.42]It's in the river.
[51:02.06]I think it counts.
[51:03.02]Does it count?
[51:04.07]I got it.
[51:04.37]I got it.
[51:05.65]I'll grab it.
[51:06.99]Well, it's on this side, the bottom right.
[51:08.97]It's not going to come around?
[51:10.47]It kept getting flipped.
[51:13.69]Is it just you?
[51:14.95]Wait, am I the trash?
[51:16.17]Who put that in there?
[51:17.01]Are you?
[51:17.37]Can you come out of here?
[51:18.25]Am I the trash?
[51:19.74]Just shut the door.
[51:21.18]Oh, it's me.
[51:22.06]I'm the trash.
[51:22.88]You're the trash.
[51:25.66]Alright, we got three stars for that one.
[51:30.99]When did we get our ultimates?
[51:34.59]I'm sure there'll be another game mechanic that's interesting.
[51:38.87]Hold on.
[51:47.18]See, unlike games with ultimates, this one's balanced.
[51:50.10]Ooh, what the fuck?
[51:52.12]Okay.
[51:53.32]Paints.
[51:54.56]What?
[51:55.00]That didn't mean anything.
[51:55.94]This game doesn't have ultimates.
[51:59.01]Okay, we- we- is somebody gonna- I- I- I- Okay, seriously.
[52:03.91]I'm gonna take like a two minute break.
[52:06.31]I don't wanna do that.
[52:07.25]Man down, man down, man down.
[52:08.73]I need a cigarette, I'll be right back.
[52:19.21]Where's the uh... Where's the junk bucket?
[52:21.43]Where's the uh... I have the junk at the top left.
[52:24.91]Hey, where's the trash?
[52:27.28]I have to crash at the top once.
[52:29.40]Oh, wait.
[52:30.64]This is true.
[52:31.26]Oh, you gotta... Well, that's not funny.
[52:34.66]Oops.
[52:37.76]Stop removing doors.
[52:39.86]I need it to be done.
[52:42.65]It was in the way.
[52:45.13]Well, I'm just manually... Manually going back and forth.
[52:53.97]How do you put doors back?
[52:55.36]Oh, there you go.
[52:56.08]You just hit A.
[52:58.11]But there's three buttons.
[52:59.50]Alright, so the top left needs to be painted.
[53:05.84]Hey, just click their head, okay?
[53:08.14]Okay, where is it?
[53:10.38]Oh, I got a lot of trash in here.
[53:12.10]You guys... You guys have hogged the trash bucket the whole... God damn it!
[53:17.42]I'm bringing the trash to you now.
[53:19.63]Well, you could just, like, not do trash right now.
[53:22.11]Or I could just mute and go, like, cough for five straight minutes to get this out of me.
[53:28.02]There's like something in my body.
[53:29.82]You brought the trash to me.
[53:30.90]You still walked outside.
[53:32.38]Can you take commands from anyone?
[53:38.00]Listen, don't tell me what to do.
[53:40.36]You're a stoa.
[53:43.96]Carpet.
[53:44.52]Carpet.
[53:45.92]Top left.
[53:48.52]So what goes in bottom right?
[53:50.74]Green paint?
[53:51.68]Hold on.
[53:54.08]Green paint, green tile.
[53:55.68]Green paint, green tile.
[53:56.58]Got it.
[54:08.14]What do you think of this rich asshole who has a tree in his house?
[54:12.54]Who has a tree in their house and a moat around the tree.
[54:18.53]I think it just is the tree's house.
[54:21.35]He's watching us.
[54:25.31]It's just where they live.
[54:30.55]Do we have to do anything with the floor first?
[54:34.11]No, it's already been slacked.
[54:39.59]It's actually... Oh.
[54:41.70]I'm barred from entry here.
[54:42.82]Sorry.
[54:45.40]What's left?
[54:45.76]Uh, I gotta... That's a trash bin right now.
[54:48.06]Alright, let me see.
[54:49.28]How we doing?
[54:50.98]I like how you're not supposed to walk on this, but as long as you just walk on it first, you're fine.
[54:55.63]Just that bedroom.
[54:56.69]It just needs that carpet, and then that's it.
[54:59.11]Then tidy up.
[55:00.03]Start tidying up.
[55:00.67]Wait, what needs carpet?
[55:01.97]The room he's in right now.
[55:03.97]We're done after that.
[55:05.17]That's not carpet.
[55:05.83]That's tiles.
[55:10.39]That's it.
[55:10.63]Tidy up.
[55:11.67]Fix that door.
[55:18.14]Bedroom?
[55:18.68]Is it a wall that's not painted in the bedroom?
[55:22.24]Are you gonna throw that real good?
[55:23.56]Stop!
[55:24.66]Stop!
[55:27.35]That's the worst.
[55:29.53]So what are we missing?
[55:34.27]Which room is missing?
[55:35.75]It's the green room.
[55:36.53]There must be one wall.
[55:37.57]Yeah, that's what I was looking for and he told me to stop.
[55:40.75]One of them.
[55:41.15]Oh, it's that one.
[55:42.30]I mean, it looks great.
[55:43.70]It looks great.
[55:47.84]Sorry.
[55:48.30]Sorry, the guy's in the way who's housework.
[55:50.02]Hey, I can't see past the tree.
[55:53.26]Okay.
[55:53.94]Here we go.
[56:01.97]Alright.
[56:02.25]It's five stars.
[56:02.89]We're still fine.
[56:06.01]I don't think you need to close the door.
[56:07.51]Ooh.
[56:13.48]dog anyone want to be dog we got the dog looks overpowered I've overpowered you mean huge and probably in the way so how come um I feel disproportioned I'm the only one who can paint tall walls and reach
[56:40.28]I'm going down.
[56:43.65]Nobody's doing that on purpose.
[56:45.95]Yes, he is.
[56:47.11]What do you mean?
[56:48.27]I'm not doing it.
[56:49.19]See, I'm going to get blamed if it's him.
[56:51.95]It's not me.
[56:53.55]There's no way that's not being done on purpose.
[56:57.08]You have to press down.
[56:57.88]Alright, what do we have to do?
[57:02.78]It's done.
[57:04.58]Let's move to Shay's Lounge.
[57:05.46]Shay's?
[57:10.31]That room needs blue carpet.
[57:13.09]This room needs tile.
[57:14.85]And that's it?
[57:17.67]That's it?
[57:17.97]Is it?
[57:20.41]Yeah, that's it.
[57:22.45]I mean, it's a huge room, though.
[57:24.45]I think it's because it's so separated.
[57:26.63]Wait for delivery?
[57:27.01]There's a big wall right there.
[57:28.03]Alright, we'll start pulling up.
[57:30.03]We got to, like, throw stuff.
[57:34.48]I got the chalakum.
[57:35.80]Get out of here.
[57:38.49]Alright, so we have to just start pulling up tile.
[57:41.31]Oh, there's a secret slipper there.
[57:44.50]We need that trash bucket in here.
[57:46.12]We need to work together ripping it up.
[57:49.04]Somebody said only one room in this house is actually inside.
[57:52.96]What?
[57:53.78]The bathroom?
[57:54.62]Gotta be the case.
[58:02.23]You gotta set it down.
[58:04.49]Not whip it.
[58:06.43]Everyone get prepared.
[58:16.33]Get that excellent Juraba985 branded carpet.
[58:24.57]Alright, we basically just have to throw stuff over the wall a lot.
[58:27.64]I think... I think it's raining and it's making random things on the ground.
[58:33.88]Yeah, this person's house is outside.
[58:37.04]Yeah.
[58:38.12]What a shitty house.
[58:41.40]Nothing we can do to save it.
[58:42.30]Alright, trash has been empty.
[58:43.30]Do we need trash in any other room?
[58:45.70]I don't think so.
[58:46.82]We need the... We don't have the green tile yet.
[58:49.95]We're gonna do the other room.
[58:50.61]We don't have the green tile yet.
[58:52.49]Can you flip it, by the way?
[58:53.37]This is a dogshit view.
[58:55.63]Thank you.
[58:55.97]Alright, green tile's here.
[59:02.52]Wait, we gotta do... Ah, shit, we have to shellack it.
[59:06.24]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[59:10.70]Toss it onto...
[59:12.84]Alright, put it in.
[59:13.74]Who said that I didn't do anything this whole stream?
[59:15.80]I did that right there.
[59:17.37]I'm done.
[59:17.71]I don't think anybody said that.
[59:19.05]I think you're just, like, projecting a little.
[59:20.81]Why are you throwing it back at me?
[59:24.05]Because, like, I don't need it.
[59:26.55]Well, maybe I will, actually.
[59:28.39]I didn't realize that that's such a limited quantity.
[59:30.36]Uh-oh.
[59:35.06]Alright, don't get boxed in here.
[59:42.29]Nice.
[59:42.67]Uh-oh.
[59:45.19]Okay, wait.
[59:46.15]Whoops.
[59:47.97]Um, I can go down here.
[59:49.51]In a minute.
[59:49.83]Alright, then we do that carpet.
[59:52.79]You're doing the tile up there.
[59:54.69]Good shit.
[59:56.49]I think I'm all tiled up.
[59:59.85]Alright, I'm gonna put this, we're gonna go, what, corner out?
[60:03.08]Right.
[60:04.24]I'm turning.
[60:07.86]Yeah, I wasn't sure if I missed those or not.
[60:15.04]But look at the power of teamwork, everybody.
[60:16.98]You can just put aside your differences.
[60:19.77]Can you imagine that this would take 100% longer if it was just me in this room and not you here, too?
[60:28.43]You ever think about that?
[60:29.11]Like, how fucked up that is?
[60:30.15]No, I'm thinking about, like, um... Why does it take two hours to put one table together when you pay people to do it?
[60:38.74]Do they not know the instructions ahead of time?
[60:42.01]Why does it cost, like, $150 for that?
[60:50.94]This is my favorite comment of the night so far.
[60:54.36]Oh, this is going too well now.
[60:56.38]ResidentSleeper.
[60:59.00]Oh, no.
[60:59.54]Now they, like, they get it.
[61:01.20]No.
[61:02.15]Wait, there's something missing here.
[61:03.63]One blue carpet and a little green wall is missing.
[61:07.37]One blue carpet.
[61:08.84]yeah where in between the trees oh that's it any uh wet spots there's only us two in my pants it's going way too swell dude we got to install wacky mods basically beat the game
[61:38.77]Where's my new mechanics?
[61:40.35]Three stars.
[61:41.21]Oh, mega low clap.
[61:42.93]No, that was ResidentSleeper clap.
[61:45.23]I just pretended it.
[61:46.27]Look at how hard this one looks.
[61:47.85]Does this guy have clown outfit rooms?
[61:52.50]Okay, we've got new type of tile, I think.
[61:56.40]We have to shellac, shellac.
[61:58.28]So shellac this whole thing.
[62:00.02]Honestly, you asked me to play this game with you and it feels like I agreed to chores.
[62:07.56]And I didn't realize it.
[62:08.86]Yeah, but didn't you also play Viscera Cleanup Detail?
[62:12.30]Oh, and he hated it and he left, he left, he abandoned the game and left the stream.
[62:17.78]Yes.
[62:17.96]So, that did happen.
[62:20.06]Well, we played for a bit, but I mean, I mostly just dragged all the dead bodies into one room.
[62:24.35]Yes, he did.
[62:27.03]Refuses to do chores.
[62:28.23]Yep.
[62:28.69]Sounds like a professional streamer.
[62:32.69]Definitely a professional.
[62:35.05]What are these Mario blocks?
[62:37.65]These are locked?
[62:38.47]I don't understand.
[62:39.54]Why is this locked?
[62:43.50]It's a locked information block.
[62:48.08]I don't get it.
[62:50.36]Why do we have so many flower packs?
[62:56.46]What?
[62:58.79]What's the new thing?
[63:00.17]Why are you carrying around gasoline?
[63:04.27]I don't know what these are.
[63:05.03]We might have to mix this stuff.
[63:06.59]That might be glue, because it looks like there's wallpaper.
[63:09.67]Alright, well, let's keep... What's this thing for?
[63:15.11]Is it trash?
[63:16.25]Dude, I think we might have to, like, sift the flour in there.
[63:18.59]Uh, let's find out.
[63:23.20]Alright, it's supposed to... It tells you the instructions.
[63:27.23]It's shellac plus paint, shellac plus carpet.
[63:29.93]Carpet.
[63:30.75]That's it.
[63:31.27]Yeah.
[63:31.87]I think we're over-complicating.
[63:32.77]There has to be, like, a second step, though, because we have, like, these big flower bags.
[63:37.99]No, I think there's just... I think this is there.
[63:39.64]This place is full of garbage.
[63:40.96]I think it's just trash, yeah.
[63:42.26]It's just trash.
[63:43.38]Alright, we do only have one bucket, though, I think.
[63:46.86]So... Pick a spot up here and just... You're gonna throw, like, a 30% full bucket away?
[63:56.39]Inefficient.
[63:57.30]Dude, I'm trying to use the bucket for the, like, paste.
[64:01.16]We got... We're on one job in here.
[64:03.29]Finish this one first.
[64:04.93]But the trash can's, like, right there.
[64:18.34]Okay.
[64:18.72]Okay, let's just put it in.
[64:19.62]What is this?
[64:21.32]Hey!
[64:21.56]This is, um...
[64:26.44]Star sees how long it takes for us to notice that he's stopped working.
[64:30.49]No, sorry, I took a drink like one time in an hour.
[64:34.17]Listen, you're only as good as you're weak as Link.
[64:36.71]Or so I've been told.
[64:38.47]I took a drink.
[64:40.73]I took a sip of soda.
[64:43.83]Get back to work, you fucker.
[64:46.64]I just want this to be as realistic as possible.
[64:48.90]That's not efficient use of your time.
[64:51.22]You only get one break a day.
[64:52.36]Get back in there and go to work.
[64:56.11]Yeah, you're lucky I'm not taking all the fucking doors off right now.
[65:01.39]I'll do it.
[65:02.66]Took one sip.
[65:05.88]Okay, so what do we actually need here?
[65:07.60]What are we doing?
[65:08.16]What's going on?
[65:08.98]We're both trying the same thing.
[65:10.36]Alright.
[65:13.82]We got a minute 55 to do everything.
[65:17.00]And what do we have to do?
[65:18.37]We just have to... We have to paste all the floors.
[65:21.57]All of them?
[65:23.13]All of them to the left.
[65:25.93]We gotta paste them all?
[65:27.22]Start in the back.
[65:28.86]What the fuck?
[65:31.08]No we don't.
[65:32.70]What?
[65:33.28]No, we just have to roll the carpet down.
[65:34.52]This is the only room we- This is the only room we had to do.
[65:38.31]Which room do we have to paste?
[65:40.03]We have to do the hallway.
[65:42.25]We're at 0% and you're saying we're done.
[65:44.35]Look, look, look.
[65:45.39]We have the hallway and then the storage room.
[65:47.21]Oh, yeah, we're fucked.
[65:48.95]The hallway, every single one of these walls needs to be done in a minute.
[65:52.44]You're gonna do that?
[65:53.32]Yeah, you got a minute.
[65:54.00]You're gonna take another sip of your drink, you piece of shit.
[65:57.34]Uh-oh.
[66:00.52]We're failing.
[66:01.94]Yeah, there's no way we're gonna be able to do this.
[66:05.28]Well, we're at 20% now.
[66:07.98]We'll get one star on this one.
[66:10.72]So what is the shellac?
[66:11.68]That's okay.
[66:12.10]That's all we had to begin with.
[66:14.54]Why do we have shellac here?
[66:16.64]I think we're done with it.
[66:17.54]The wall in here needs to just be pink.
[66:21.26]Alright, let's go.
[66:23.78]But we have to tear down the wallpaper.
[66:28.02]What do we have for percentage?
[66:30.56]Uh, 45, 50.
[66:31.32]Where's the garbage?
[66:35.34]Down the bottom.
[66:36.56]It's 30 seconds.
[66:39.03]It's just a shellac bucket right now.
[66:41.17]I'll take care of that.
[66:41.75]Here, here, here.
[66:42.53]We don't need the shellac for anything anymore, right?
[66:45.54]Right.
[66:46.34]20 seconds.
[66:48.22]Paint as many walls as you can.
[66:51.78]Why did they spawn this back in the same room that I was in with?
[66:58.34]Please just put this down.
[67:01.17]10 seconds.
[67:02.03]We're almost done.
[67:04.47]Bottom left, bottom left, bottom left.
[67:06.09]I'm going to throw all the garbage in the neighbor's house.
[67:10.41]One, zero.
[67:11.43]Wait, what?
[67:12.17]How did we get one star?
[67:13.99]The hallway was at zero.
[67:15.06]How?
[67:15.60]Did we paint it wrong?
[67:16.40]I don't know.
[67:21.50]Maybe it's because we didn't finish.
[67:23.04]Do it again.
[67:25.66]I'm just going to start removing things.
[67:27.35]Yes, just start.
[67:29.15]That's first.
[67:30.05]Start getting rid of trash.
[67:32.39]Alright, trash in the left room.
[67:34.49]I'm gonna tear down these walls, Gorbachev, Gorbachev, Gorbeth.
[67:40.57]This carpet is here.
[67:42.86]Trash upper left room.
[67:43.78]This carpet is here.
[67:47.24]Ain't that the truth.
[67:47.98]Why can't I just throw this into the street?
[67:50.98]Yeah, what button is it?
[67:55.81]Alright, the peel has been peeled.
[68:04.78]Have you guys ever seen this otter?
[68:07.14]Do you want another drink, Brick?
[68:10.78]They gave us too many paints to confuse us.
[68:12.64]That's the problem.
[68:14.68]Yeah, they wanted to test your foreman skills.
[68:21.03]What if you're colorblind?
[68:23.93]Um... I don't know.
[68:26.23]Do they have a setting?
[68:28.81]Maybe they don't.
[68:29.27]I don't know.
[68:33.85]Do we have all these?
[68:35.27]Okay, we're going in here now.
[68:37.01]Are you having fun in here?
[68:38.35]In this bottom left room?
[68:39.05]How am I falling down?
[68:41.65]Stupid fucking Minecraft mystery block.
[68:44.12]Get the fuck out of here.
[68:47.74]Does Minecraft have mystery blocks now?
[68:49.50]It's been a while since I played.
[68:50.78]I have to clean this up.
[69:02.57]Alright, all the trash has been removed from the house.
[69:05.65]Incorrect.
[69:06.15]We have the... We have the trash in this room on the floor.
[69:09.91]There's fucking wrapping paper up here.
[69:11.33]Hold on, I'll get it.
[69:14.25]Oh my... Oh my word.
[69:16.66]This whole hallway is full of trash.
[69:19.26]I'm going for it.
[69:19.96]I'm getting everything.
[69:25.90]Wow.
[69:26.58]It was 200 IQ to put all the trash in front of the recycling bin.
[69:30.08]Now I can't get to it.
[69:34.21]Oh, I can't get to the recycling.
[69:40.06]All I hear right now is, milk me.
[69:42.86]Listen, you're not getting any of this paycheck.
[69:48.08]Alright, so what do we need?
[69:49.08]Do we need pink carpet?
[69:52.14]I think we just did it wrong.
[69:53.18]Where's the blueprint?
[69:54.28]Give me that.
[69:55.91]With three minutes.
[70:00.25]Hallway needs to have pink walls, which is almost done.
[70:02.93]There's one thing missing somewhere.
[70:04.71]The storage room needs to be, ground has to be orange, not pink.
[70:09.48]Orange.
[70:10.56]And these walls on the bottom left need to be like purple.
[70:12.80]Do we even have a, what color was it?
[70:16.64]Purple?
[70:17.52]No, just the ground.
[70:19.46]Yeah, that's it.
[70:20.04]Now we just, we have to just do the carpet on the,
[70:29.53]Don't do that.
[70:30.69]Which character are you?
[70:33.38]Um... He's the one that just fell and broke his jaw on one of the counters.

[71:39.89]And particularly, could it not be me?
[71:42.59]We just have to do orange carpet.
[71:47.91]Oops.
[71:49.53]Just fight over the carpet.
[72:02.51]Hey, we did it.
[72:08.95]This is a dirty ass house.
[72:11.78]Not anymore.
[72:12.20]At least it's not outside.
[72:13.26]Is there something else?
[72:17.56]We're missing one thing.
[72:20.06]Now we're missing a couple things.
[72:22.20]Is it the outfit on the wall?
[72:24.70]I'm going to rotate.
[72:28.09]Bucket.
[72:28.95]You're two of them.
[72:30.27]Yeah, I count as one.
[72:33.77]What's the other one?
[72:36.09]Is that wall supposed to look like that?
[72:37.67]I think so.
[72:38.59]Two left.
[72:38.99]What is it?
[72:39.31]The stuff on the wall?
[72:41.37]Shut the doors?
[72:42.39]I don't know.
[72:43.31]Uh-oh.
[72:45.01]I don't know.
[72:45.39]Uh-oh.
[72:45.69]I don't know.
[72:46.73]Something too close to the front?
[72:53.43]Mop it up?
[72:54.70]I didn't see anything.
[72:56.44]Yeah, I didn't see anything either.
[72:57.72]It flushed the toilet.
[73:02.80]I think you had to plunge the toilet.
[73:04.28]I mean, we all took a shit in there, right?
[73:09.08]Wait, all of us?
[73:10.72]Yeah, in that five minute.
[73:13.46]Without... Oh my god.
[73:17.18]We powered through.
[73:18.08]Is it an outhouse?
[73:22.52]Okay, okay, pay attention.
[73:23.79]You have to paint a wall with glue and then wallpaper.
[73:32.96]Alright, so, shellac, wallpaper, done.
[73:37.05]Ooh, now it's a different season.
[73:41.27]Uh, this, yep, that's a ice mechanic.
[73:43.49]I was trying to throw you in, but it didn't work.
[73:47.47]You now slip.
[73:51.02]Do we have a bucket?
[73:51.56]Alright, clean up.
[73:54.02]Clean up, clean up first.
[73:57.68]I have a question.
[73:59.44]Yes.
[74:00.66]Why would you want your house to be ice?
[74:02.58]I don't know.
[74:05.59]Like a cartoon land.
[74:08.23]Say that word again.
[74:10.09]Cartoon land.
[74:12.57]I'm done.
[74:15.03]What?
[74:16.35]I don't want to hear it.
[74:22.07]Okay, so living room, I don't, there's too many things.
[74:26.21]I'm not the foreman.
[74:27.15]I can't think.
[74:28.15]My brain is dead.
[74:29.27]There's too many things.
[74:33.61]Just give me a task and I'll do it.
[74:35.23]Alright, give us both a task.
[74:37.41]We got... Carpet.
[74:39.13]Carpet?
[74:39.65]Where's purple carpet go?
[74:40.95]Purple carpet goes top right.
[74:42.51]Top right.
[74:43.19]And the walls need to be done up with the currently existing in the same room purple tubes.
[74:50.36]So top right is purple.
[74:52.86]Top right is purple.
[74:54.50]Top left also needs to be purple walls, but they need to be painted.
[74:59.97]So top right is not paint.
[75:02.61]You knocked it over.
[75:05.77]I'll wait until you're ready.
[75:10.40]We also need green carpet at the bottom.
[75:13.28]I got it.
[75:13.84]Left.
[75:16.04]Purple paint on the wall is top right.
[75:17.26]My head hurts.
[75:25.07]I didn't know how long it was going to take.
[75:26.47]I knew it was going to... I didn't know how long it was going to take.
[75:29.09]Is he... Talking shit.
[75:36.51]You messed it up.
[75:38.41]The floor is ice.
[75:39.35]I'm sorry.
[75:43.74]Green carpet.
[75:45.32]Phone's ringing.
[75:47.02]Alright, now we do this on the walls.
[75:51.62]So we need that bucket back up here.
[75:56.04]Okay, but can I like empty it first?
[75:57.43]You already did.
[76:00.97]Alright, now we do the walls.
[76:09.38]Ooh, I like that.
[76:11.54]Oh god, it goes away.
[76:14.13]No, maybe that means it just dries.
[76:16.47]Yeah, so you have to, like, paste it and then put the... Oh, shit.
[76:20.73]I got you, I got you, I got you.
[76:22.25]You paint.
[76:22.55]Purple's down here.
[76:23.21]Purple's down here.
[76:23.89]I got it!
[76:24.85]Alright, bring the purple up here.
[76:25.73]I'm going to paint and then you... Go.
[76:31.55]Hold on, I'm going to bring it closer.
[76:34.24]Oh, no, that's... Okay, I don't know why I thought you were going to paint over what I'm doing.
[76:38.64]Alright, I got the top left room.
[76:42.75]I didn't know how long it was going to take.
[76:43.89]I didn't know how long it was going to take, but you're fucking dumb.
[76:48.19]Got him.
[76:48.53]I'm going to see a couple of ee-hees.
[76:49.99]It'll be fun.
[76:54.08]Wouldn't that be so funny if you did, like, a kek?
[76:56.16]Alright, this room is done.
[76:59.40]Get out of here.
[77:01.80]You took too long.
[77:03.04]It was targeting the thing next to it, even though I was very clearly not looking at that thing.
[77:08.60]What a dope.
[77:11.55]Okay.
[77:11.65]Here you go.
[77:12.53]You ready?
[77:12.81]No, no, no.
[77:14.13]I gotta get rid of this trash because you spilled something.
[77:25.10]Don't mind me.
[77:25.68]Just sneaking in.
[77:27.56]Here we go.
[77:32.84]One more on this side.

[77:36.19]Get it.
[77:37.07]Get her done.
[77:37.85]You guys remember the 90s?
[77:41.64]I'm pretty sure he still does that.
[77:43.93]Pretty sure he does too.
[77:45.85]He's still currently touring.
[77:46.99]That's it.
[77:51.77]We have a minute.
[77:53.41]The ice didn't even matter.
[77:54.65]Be careful what you wish for.
[78:02.72]Five left.
[78:03.48]What else?
[78:03.92]I can't wait until we get to the lava mansion.

[78:43.87]Wait, which one am I?
[78:45.29]You're the otter.
[78:46.77]Oh.
[78:47.23]Now this is a cartoon.
[78:48.81]You've been extolling the virtues of being the otter.
[78:51.21]Alright, we did this.
[78:52.93]We can go up another level.
[78:56.46]Isn't it cool how, like, the otter gets bonus stats in the water levels?
[79:03.26]Wow, she got an achievement for Game of Thrones.
[79:05.08]Yeah, I got that too.
[79:06.70]A Song of Ice and Fire or something, right?
[79:10.93]Song of Fire and Snow.
[79:13.96]What's this one?
[79:16.96]I told you to be careful what you wish for.
[79:18.44]Alright, I'm getting the couch.
[79:20.92]Quote, the ice didn't even matter.
[79:23.00]I would spin this.
[79:24.42]Because, like, this is a terrible angle.
[79:28.32]What was that noise?
[79:30.50]I can't, we can't get in there.
[79:31.88]It's messed up.
[79:32.58]We have to go all the way around, I think.
[79:33.90]No, we don't.
[79:36.52]Wait, where am I?
[79:39.70]Which one am I?
[79:41.34]I actually got lost up there.
[79:46.36]Okay.
[79:47.24]Okay.
[79:48.01]Ready?
[79:48.87]I can't pick it up.
[79:49.67]There it is.
[79:51.45]Where does this even go?
[79:53.69]Outside?
[79:54.77]How do we?
[79:57.11]Hold on.
[79:57.35]Let me open the door.
[79:59.46]Alright.
[79:59.80]Turn.
[80:01.64]It's ice.
[80:02.82]Oh, yeah.
[80:03.32]It is ice.
[80:04.48]Why?
[80:04.66]Why?
[80:04.94]There's three people.
[80:07.84]Just leave it in here.
[80:14.77]Just throw me, throw me.
[80:16.67]I'll get it.
[80:17.03]Throw me, throw me.
[80:18.50]I am pushing the throw button.
[80:19.82]Throw me.
[80:22.94]Oh.
[80:24.08]Oh, my God.
[80:25.04]Reset.
[80:25.56]We haven't done anything.
[80:27.12]Reset.
[80:28.66]Okay.
[80:29.10]Purple carpet.
[80:30.16]Oh, my God.
[80:33.87]You just told me to do that.
[80:35.57]You told him.
[80:38.21]I thought you could, like, read.
[80:40.87]You just said, restart, restart, just do it.
[80:44.55]And I'm like, okay, why wouldn't we?
[80:46.75]Restart.
[80:48.37]Restart it slow.
[80:49.43]Restart it slow.
[80:50.13]Well, now I know you're being fucking dope.
[80:52.47]Facetious.
[80:56.48]Alright, what's the first room we're doing?
[80:59.84]Okay, fuck the couch.
[81:00.62]Seriously, it's wasting time.
[81:06.24]Restart.
[81:07.27]Didn't get a good enough jump.
[81:08.33]Why can't you read sarcasm?
[81:11.95]Okay, I'm gonna start in... What do we even need to do?
[81:17.05]We have to... The couch is the only thing to do right now, unless there's trash.
[81:21.29]Is there, like, a trash room?
[81:22.85]No, there's a trash bucket at the bottom, right?
[81:24.83]We need to take the wallpaper off in this room.
[81:27.03]How do... Like, I'm not even mentally present.
[81:30.12]Alright, trash it up.
[81:40.98]Oh, we have to move that couch because it's locked in the door when deliveries come.
[81:43.60]Alright, what are we doing with this?
[81:45.30]I'm going to dump this.
[81:51.44]They won't let me.
[81:54.18]I'm going to get any more trash I need to pull up.
[81:56.79]I don't think so.
[81:59.21]So bring that.
[81:59.71]We need to paste the walls.
[82:00.59]Leave it on the front porch.
[82:02.57]I'll get it later.
[82:04.01]Don't make me sign for concrete.
[82:05.85]Throw that glue over here.
[82:09.26]Which one of these rooms needs to be purple?
[82:10.72]Where's the blueprint?
[82:17.85]Okay, uh, purple is probably... Check blueprint.
[82:22.81]I got it.
[82:26.15]Purple's left.
[82:27.31]So this room has to be... This room here.
[82:29.07]The bottom left is striped.
[82:31.05]Bottom left is striped, and this is just paint.
[82:34.97]Dude, can you guys deliver it all at once next time?
[82:39.61]Or I'm gonna, I don't, what am I doing?
[82:42.11]You're accepting deliveries.
[82:43.01]You're doing a great job.
[82:44.49]What do I do now that I've accepted the deliveries?
[82:46.75]Now what you're gonna do is you're gonna go to the, you're gonna get the glue, you're gonna fill this bucket next to me.
[82:51.80]Alright, get that paint bucket up at the top, and then go to the bottom right room.
[82:56.96]Take that and fill that with glue, and then you're going to slack the bottom left.
[83:02.14]And then shrink it.
[83:03.72]And then don't come to work tomorrow.
[83:08.03]Are we done with the paint?
[83:09.77]I think we're done with the paint.
[83:25.95]Is this room supposed to be purple carpet?
[83:28.53]That's supposed to be green paint on the walls in the lower right.
[83:33.11]Lower left is shellac and, uh, where's the carpet go?
[83:38.86]Yes, you're correct with what you're describing.
[83:42.75]I'm gonna- You didn't mix- You didn't even do it.
[83:45.58]I didn't- I didn't do it.
[83:46.58]I- There's a lot of cleaning up.
[83:47.58]There's ice.
[83:48.58]I had to get two deliveries.
[83:49.86]Uh, you're just gonna throw me under the bus after all that- I had to walk uphill in the ice both ways to get to the front door today.
[83:55.74]I actually did.
[83:56.84]I actually did, though.
[83:58.30]Fucking god damn fucking idiot fucking stupid fucking god damn.
[84:07.31]Alright, you ready?
[84:11.02]I didn't do this job before, so I don't... This purse is too big!
[84:20.56]No, I just trashed!
[84:24.87]I'm wearing one of those tacky tourist outfits for Halloween.
[84:32.79]Okay, shellac.
[84:34.17]I'll clean this up.
[84:38.92]Alright, um, okay.
[84:40.44]Can you help me paste the walls, and I will put the wallpaper over the paste?
[84:46.42]I don't have anything I can do, so I'm just gonna clean.
[84:50.45]Star, you've made a real mess about something.
[84:53.23]Pick up the paste?
[84:54.59]No, I need that.
[84:55.33]Okay, sure.
[84:57.75]This room is so tiny and shitty.
[85:02.08]Alright, how about... You can't target the things you want to do!
[85:05.90]Can somebody come paste these walls?
[85:08.44]Star, where are you going with that?
[85:10.06]Shut up!
[85:10.70]You're supposed to be pasting!
[85:11.78]I'm cleaning!
[85:12.46]I'm cleaning this fucking room!
[85:15.96]Hey!
[85:17.10]You don't just put it in another spot!
[85:21.14]Okay, I'm ready!
[85:23.86]You need me to paint.
[85:25.62]Yeah, I need you to do the pasting.
[85:26.94]What do you think you were doing down there?
[85:35.42]We're gonna have to get like a saline IV going in you.
[85:44.22]My brain doesn't work this late in the day.
[85:45.98]I should have been in bed an hour.
[85:48.22]What?
[85:49.24]There's two more?
[85:50.36]This is not trash?
[85:53.20]I need that spit in your mouth like you want me to do to you.
[85:57.46]Hey, can you come back and face these two walls?
[86:00.92]Why are you running in a circle with a blueprint?
[86:04.82]I was getting it out and I was avoiding looking in front of you.
[86:08.76]Okay, top two only.
[86:10.22]Alright, ready?
[86:10.62]Top two only.
[86:13.12]23 seconds.
[86:14.42]Get out of the way.
[86:17.24]Get out of the room.
[86:19.26]Just get out of the room.
[86:21.48]You're just messing it up.
[86:23.12]Oh my god.
[86:24.90]Go.
[86:27.76]Clean it.
[86:28.18]I got it.
[86:28.84]I got it.
[86:29.22]I got it.
[86:29.46]I got it.
[86:40.57]I swear, you were an obstacle for that level.
[86:46.29]There was a moving block that was just getting in the way.
[86:49.67]2.9 star, that's fine.
[87:00.34]I tried my best.
[87:05.84]We haven't done this one?
[87:07.02]No.
[87:11.18]That was a big one.
[87:12.10]That was a big one.
[87:13.18]That was a big one.
[87:13.66]This game needs a scoreboard.
[87:16.28]You know... I don't like the snow levels.
[87:24.75]If that's supposed to be me, you're doing a very good job.
[87:26.67]Oh, wait.
[87:29.05]This is a three-parter.
[87:29.91]Okay, we got purple carpets, striped purple walls, and then special blue walls?
[87:39.14]Yeah, wallpaper.
[87:41.24]I'll take that, thank you.
[87:44.30]What do we even have to do?
[87:47.58]I'll take care of this.
[87:48.18]You guys wait for another delivery.
[87:49.26]Just hang out and talk.
[87:50.71]I need that puke bucket.
[88:00.11]What do I have to talk to Etalyx about?
[88:02.53]I don't know.
[88:06.71]Yeah, right.
[88:07.37]I don't know, like Star Wars or something?
[88:11.07]Don't knock that over.
[88:11.77]Don't knock that over.
[88:13.21]He probably likes The Last Jedi, so it's okay.
[88:16.22]I do not.
[88:17.60]Oh, boy.
[88:18.22]Oh, there you go.
[88:20.02]Name a game that I like that came out in the last five years.
[88:23.56]Name a game?
[88:25.62]Dwarf game.
[88:28.10]Dwarf game?
[88:29.24]Yeah, dwarf miner shooting game.
[88:32.45]That game was okay.
[88:34.07]He did it.
[88:34.47]Yeah, you like that.
[88:36.33]I'm going to get that delivery, please.
[88:42.19]Minecraft.
[88:45.47]Did Minecraft come out in the last five years?
[88:47.79]Yeah, I think so.
[88:49.17]Like 1.0?
[88:52.65]We got to get glue going in the top left.
[88:56.15]Not before we have all the trash removed up here.
[88:58.85]That's not trash.
[89:01.71]Don't you dare come in here and start doing things.
[89:04.51]Is this not the purple carpet room?
[89:06.62]No, it is.
[89:07.28]Sorry.
[89:07.62]Sorry.
[89:09.50]I really flew off the handle there.
[89:10.78]Sorry about that.
[89:11.64]I just threw it in the garbage.
[89:13.24]Alright, now we can put paste in here.
[89:18.02]Okay, we need to paste the top left room.
[89:23.02]And we need to paste the bottom left room.
[89:25.64]Different colors.
[89:26.23]That's all we have, I think.
[89:28.09]Is there anything else to do?
[89:30.47]Let's check.
[89:31.71]Carpet.
[89:34.23]There's only going to be one paste, so we can only do one room at a time.
[89:37.09]Yep.
[89:37.93]Yep.
[89:39.24]So one person is non-essential.
[89:41.19]So I'm just gonna, you know, I'll not be the obstacle this time.
[89:44.11]I just don't want to get yelled at.
[89:45.29]Alright, we'll do this room first.
[89:50.17]I mean, you could just like put the paste in your mouth and just spit it into the wall.
[89:53.43]And then do it.
[89:53.91]That wouldn't be too hard.
[89:55.71]Alright, let's start in the big corner.
[89:57.99]Hey, you know what?
[89:58.35]If you guys need to rotate, call in, call in the AC-130.
[90:02.39]Listen, this paste holds the wallpaper in place.
[90:04.39]If you put it in your mouth, maybe it'll hold your lips in place.
[90:06.57]Alex, Alex!
[90:14.43]Etalyx, what are you doing?
[90:15.77]I got... I'm... Are you happy with anyone?
[90:29.52]I'm waiting.
[90:31.00]You sit up there like the newspaper rolled up.
[90:33.84]How do you live with him?
[90:35.40]You try to... You try to like...
[90:38.64]Wait, uh-oh, there's a little oopsie over here.
[90:47.09]Where are you going?
[90:48.05]I have to throw this away because we have to use that bucket of paste.
[90:52.33]And AFK player is just outside.
[90:56.97]I explained this.
[90:57.53]There is nothing for me to do.
[90:59.42]You know what?
[90:59.88]I did read that this game doesn't scale based on how many people you're playing with, so it's not any easier or harder.
[91:06.56]There, I gave you something to do.
[91:08.50]Okay, thank you.
[91:12.90]Which wall are we on?
[91:15.37]Thank you, Master.
[91:21.81]What just happened?
[91:25.55]Why is this trash now?
[91:27.01]What?
[91:30.81]I think you put the... I don't know.
[91:33.83]It must have gotten empty.
[91:35.15]We got two minutes.
[91:36.19]Yeah, we got plenty of time.
[91:38.10]oh my god you haven't even done this one room yet okay so paste let's go there you go now put it on the wall don't look at me nice work we just kind of stuffed in the corner
[92:05.67]And that's it for this one, right?
[92:07.19]You need to glue this entire room down here with that.
[92:11.43]Okay.
[92:13.03]And then that's it.
[92:13.83]Well, how about you do that?
[92:14.67]Alright, there's the glue.
[92:17.59]And I'll tidy up.
[92:18.73]I mean, I just want you to participate.
[92:20.97]So I'll fill it up for you.
[92:22.09]Ready?
[92:22.82]See?
[92:23.00]There we go.
[92:29.82]Now I'm going to move over here.
[92:31.52]And I'm going to be ready with... Hold on.
[92:36.76]I'm working overtime here.
[92:41.32]Sorry, I took your job there.
[92:46.40]Can we get a rotate, champ?
[92:49.70]What is that?
[92:51.31]Hey, champ, can you give us a rotate?
[92:53.13]He wants you to go pick up the thing and move the thing.
[92:56.07]Pick up the thing and move the thing.
[92:58.19]Turn the camera.
[93:01.11]Thanks, champ.
[93:02.11]You guys need it again, let me know.
[93:11.55]I think we're going to need it again here in a second, champ.
[93:14.59]Wait, what are you doing?
[93:16.95]Alright, let's tidy up.
[93:17.79]Alright, everybody, back it up.
[93:21.36]That's a day's work.
[93:23.14]All in a day's work.
[93:26.00]You fucking guys are so bad at this game.
[93:27.70]Like, I'm missing dinner now.
[93:29.94]How do you still have that from so long ago?
[93:34.61]That's so...
[93:39.23]You know what?
[93:39.55]I hope in 100 years somebody digs up your XLR or whatever it is and plays that.
[93:45.95]It'll be on there.
[93:46.87]Uh-oh.
[93:50.41]We're not good enough.
[93:51.17]We need three more stars.
[93:53.07]We can go back to floor one because we were terrible on that one.
[93:56.16]That's true.
[93:57.24]We did miss at least two plus stars.
[94:06.64]Oh, these are going to be the real baby hours.
[94:08.60]10,000 years from now, that's the only evidence of humanity that's left.
[94:12.64]Don't alt-tab is what I've learned.
[94:14.60]Why?
[94:15.68]Because if you're doing this broadcast thing, it freezes your feed.
[94:19.58]Oh, yeah.
[94:20.22]Look at how dogshit this is.
[94:21.68]Yeah, it's a one star.
[94:23.94]This is my bedtime.
[94:24.89]Did you know that?
[94:27.33]5.30?
[94:27.35]It's 5.30.
[94:30.04]On the west coast.
[94:31.54]But over here, it's 6.30.
[94:32.44]No, it's 5.30 there.
[94:33.26]Alright.
[94:34.32]What do we have to do?
[94:36.18]Guys, we're supposed to get three stars.
[94:39.13]I'm looking at the clock.
[94:40.45]It's actually 6.30 here.
[94:42.91]Oh.
[94:43.83]It's weird.
[94:45.55]It's still very early.
[94:48.29]What time do you wake up?
[94:51.74]Like noon.
[94:53.72]You go to bed at 6.30 and you wake up at noon.
[94:58.23]He's got six good hours a day.
[95:01.45]I was going to say, that's like... Top left yellow, not orange.
[95:05.73]Orange bottom.
[95:08.21]Oops, I kicked it.
[95:08.93]Alright.
[95:09.81]Let's start pulling stuff up.
[95:11.82]I'll get the trash.
[95:13.56]I'll get this door.
[95:16.62]Going back to this, begs the question, how did we manage to 1-star this?
[95:21.48]Because this is still 1-star, didn't know how to press X. What's going on here?
[95:30.37]Someone get the door, please!
[95:38.43]Alright, we got this here.
[95:41.29]Any more trash?
[95:43.33]All the stuff on the floor.
[95:46.61]Can I have that?
[95:48.45]Okay, put it right in the door.
[95:49.63]Nice.
[95:50.30]How did we manage to one-star this, Mr. Disruption?
[95:53.16]Yeah, you heard what I called you.
[96:05.92]Alright, yeah, you just do it.
[96:09.66]It'll be easier.
[96:10.84]I think close the door.
[96:11.62]It'll probably help.
[96:13.41]No, no, close the door.
[96:15.39]Yeah, I'll just...
[96:17.34]Apparently.
[96:17.86]We got paint.
[96:18.49]We got paint.
[96:19.15]Get the paint.
[96:19.69]We got paint.
[96:20.61]Get the paint.
[96:21.27]Go get the paint.
[96:21.91]Let me go.
[96:28.13]Oh, this is not.
[96:28.87]Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[96:35.70]Trade you.
[96:37.40]Okay.
[96:37.62]Where's the orange go?
[96:41.74]We got orange paint here.
[96:42.88]We need that trash bucket again.
[96:44.72]We need the trash bucket.
[96:47.01]I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
[96:48.86]Oh, you get it.
[96:49.74]You're going down there already.
[96:52.68]You're taking the... You're closest.
[96:55.42]Just toss it over here.
[96:59.40]I wonder how we didn't do this for the last time.
[97:02.00]There's two minutes.
[97:03.12]Would you calm down?
[97:07.61]I didn't say anything, I just replayed that part of the stream.
[97:10.52]You fucking guys are so bad at this game.
[97:11.98]He didn't get a GoXLR sponsor, so he just has to do it by his memory.
[97:21.60]Have you even used that for its intended purpose?
[97:25.14]What is its intended purpose?
[97:26.82]I thought it was for you to... That wasn't... What?
[97:29.34]The joke was that you played that while you were mad at Overwatch.
[97:34.10]Oh, well, no, back in the day, I was using it to record other people who were mad at Overwatch.
[97:38.74]Right, so I gave you a I'm mad at Overwatch clip, and you haven't used it.
[97:41.92]I did use it during... That was like a long time ago.
[97:47.76]We don't get three stars.
[97:48.97]Okay.
[97:51.67]Can you peel this?
[97:53.67]Thank you.
[97:59.57]Now on your way out, just scoop that up.
[98:03.11]On your way out, Scoop.
[98:06.51]Did you not shut the door?
[98:07.61]What are we missing?
[98:12.97]What are we missing?
[98:14.47]Why?
[98:15.17]We only have 42 seconds.
[98:16.99]We have 40 seconds.
[98:18.59]Is something in the kitchen?
[98:22.79]What?
[98:23.07]Are we stupid?
[98:28.25]The kitchen wall?
[98:29.25]I don't see anywhere.
[98:31.71]Did we paint the wrong room?
[98:34.75]No.
[98:39.13]Tiny wall.
[98:41.23]Where?
[98:42.07]Can we get that painted?
[98:43.18]We're not going to get three stars.
[98:44.12]Where's a tiny wall?
[98:49.16]Oh, I see it.
[98:51.66]Oh, I see it, too.
[98:53.30]Oh, no.
[98:53.84]Oh, wow.
[98:58.70]Okay.
[98:58.97]Good.
[99:05.41]Is there any in between?
[99:08.52]There's two minutes.
[99:10.28]We got plenty of time.
[99:11.50]Yeah.
[99:12.52]We missed one fourth of a wall.
[99:29.35]Quickly now.
[99:31.69]We got this.
[99:33.17]We learned nothing.
[99:34.13]Yeah, I know.
[99:34.71]Third try.
[99:35.03]I hope so.
[99:35.59]Well, at least no one can say this is going well anymore.
[99:49.42]You know, that doesn't help very much because I have to set it down.
[99:54.91]Shut up.
[99:59.32]I just now I'm looking at you with a shocked whoa what the heck I just threw a bucket it's like into like threw a roof for you that doesn't help very much like where's the awe what do you mean oh like as in like oh oh why would there be an awe
[100:23.54]No, like, shock and awe.
[100:24.92]Not like, aww.
[100:26.67]Oh, I thought you meant like, hey, I threw that bucket in for you.
[100:29.45]Aww, you did that for me?
[100:30.27]No.
[100:35.33]Well, thanks anyways, though.
[100:38.13]Shock and awe.
[100:41.81]Well, you spelled something over here.
[100:44.15]I did that.
[100:45.85]No, I... What button is it?
[100:52.35]Oh, I got it.
[100:55.02]Whoa, she's a real Jack.
[100:57.70]Alright, so we got plenty of time now.
[100:59.40]Seriously, like, you didn't even paint this one wall.
[101:02.35]Come on.
[101:04.95]This is where we start making mistakes.
[101:06.93]Nope.
[101:07.97]You got the paint.
[101:08.57]I'm going to get this trash.
[101:10.31]I'm bringing the mango ice cream.
[101:16.57]You may want to get the bucket that's outside because I'm just too... Well, it's alright.
[101:21.02]It's alright.
[101:21.56]You guys just can handle that.
[101:22.68]I can handle this.
[101:29.19]Alright, we got this small wall right off the bat.
[101:31.85]Good.
[101:34.65]Good, good, good.
[101:38.05]I hope I never see this level again.
[101:40.95]I hope I do.
[101:41.51]In fact, we might, because there's still another wall.
[101:47.18]Let me help you.
[101:47.72]95.
[101:47.96]I got it, I got it, I got it, stop.
[101:54.72]Ugh!
[101:56.18]You ever just try and go and do something, and then the whole world...
[101:59.42]rotates what's left where'd you guys leave up here when did you leave there's three left hold on wait hang on it's well there's only one thing left let me rotate the whole world rotate the world rotate the world please don't do this to me how does this keep happening where is it
[102:26.99]trash outside does that count this cut does it it does it does count the trash on the porch alright do we have enough with 32 we need one more star do we need a single yes just one let's do level one level one level one this game's got a lot of replayability
[102:56.76]Alright, I bet you could do this by yourself.
[103:02.39]That's it.
[103:02.75]How did we not need this?
[103:03.99]It just needs a pink wall.
[103:06.85]I think, you know when you see how much you've grown?
[103:11.71]In just a short amount of time.
[103:13.73]We couldn't figure this out in more than three foldments.
[103:17.56]It doesn't tell you the buttons!
[103:20.36]How many furries does it take to paint a wall?
[103:24.14]As many as you want.
[103:28.18]One could do it probably in like a week if you skidded it kind of casually.
[103:37.08]What I want to know is how we finished it but didn't get three stars.
[103:43.87]I see.
[103:44.37]That's how.
[103:47.73]I think that might answer your question.
[103:51.91]How much spill is there?
[103:53.55]It's a never-ending spill.
[104:01.43]How did that... I pressed A to drop it, and it spilled.
[104:04.71]Alright, we can continue and do the progression.
[104:09.85]Into the elevator.
[104:15.36]We're about to unlock a new character, guys.
[104:17.76]Oh, what is it?
[104:19.82]I want to be an F-16 jet.
[104:27.38]Oh.
[104:28.42]We went one too high.
[104:34.47]How could we all be facing the wrong direction?
[104:36.57]Alright, we go this way.
[104:37.98]Wait.
[104:39.82]To the left.
[104:41.32]And then up.
[104:47.60]Uh-oh.
[104:47.94]Unlucky number 13.
[104:51.01]Uh-oh.
[104:52.41]Uh-oh.
[104:54.35]If this was a real hotel, there wouldn't even be a number 13.
[104:56.53]What the hell are we supposed to do here?
[105:02.92]I'm finding that info out.
[105:05.26]We are supposed to be... Oh, it's a mixy match.
[105:09.14]Yeah, it's a... And there's slits.
[105:13.12]And there's couches.
[105:14.83]Good thing we have plenty of time.
[105:16.07]Is there even a bucket?
[105:16.81]Where's the bucket?
[105:19.37]We have nothing.
[105:20.25]There's no bucket.
[105:23.67]Oh, there's that bucket.
[105:25.99]Pretty brushes to the door.
[105:27.29]Is it for me?
[105:27.91]Does that have my name on it?
[105:31.83]okay you joke but that's that's real life which package is that I have experienced that here in this house yeah we just have to just peel off the stuff one by one what a what a great treat you know for holidays
[105:57.96]just do repetitive tasks with your friends that's what Christmas is all about some of my favorite games are games where I just have to like paint a house unironically House Flipper is one of my favorite video games that's you just you like suck up bugs and vacuum cleaners and stuff
[106:26.50]just clean up a house and Viscera Cleanup Detail that's one of my favorite games you just clean a house seeing pattern so would you say like the big game companies are trying too hard they just need to make like house cleaners and that's the next genre like it it was like Minecraft like survival battle royale cleaner yes
[106:49.32]is next yes I don't know are they trying too hard or are they not trying hard enough dude if there was like a 100 million dollar budget House Flipper type game I would I would that's all I would do and it's like an MMO and you get to flip your houses to other gamers and then they get to live in the house alright you've painted the right walls here
[107:13.45]I painted one wall and it was the right wall.
[107:15.29]I'm just going to keep this up.
[107:18.55]No, because then we can't... No, it just alternates.
[107:23.42]How hard is it to alternate, Jeremy?
[107:25.42]I don't know.
[107:25.86]What about the walls we can't see?
[107:38.21]Listen, if our eyes are real...
[107:54.74]Okay, got it.
[107:55.64]How can mirrors be real?
[107:58.22]I'm going to do a rotate.
[107:59.22]Is everyone ready for a rotate?
[108:00.57]I feel like there was a full 25 seconds.
[108:02.97]Alright, go.
[108:07.41]Somebody didn't peel this paint off.
[108:10.71]How are we ever going to get?
[108:12.85]You say someone didn't kill this paint off, which is like just an accusatory way.
[108:17.74]Like none of us did it.
[108:19.18]What do you mean someone didn't?
[108:21.40]It could have been me.
[108:23.46]Someone didn't take this off.
[108:25.13]No one.
[108:25.63]Do we do blue here or purple?
[108:29.53]Purple.
[108:30.57]Yeah, I'm trying to put the blame on one person.
[108:31.79]It could have been me.
[108:32.97]I'm that one person.
[108:33.71]It could have been me.
[108:37.03]That sounds like backtracking from your PR department.
[108:39.81]No, no.
[108:40.79]Somebody didn't do this.
[108:41.79]We need to rotate.
[108:42.56]I'm going to start cleaning up.
[108:48.04]Is there anything to clean up?
[108:52.68]We see one more purple wall, right?
[108:56.42]Does that account for like... Well, we're not even done.
[109:01.04]Our progress is not good.
[109:03.77]Are you sure?
[109:04.43]I knew it was reversed.
[109:05.91]You were so sure, though.
[109:07.43]I was.
[109:07.99]What do you mean, reversed?
[109:10.80]Yeah, these are wrong.
[109:13.50]I was so sure.
[109:15.80]What?
[109:19.10]Fuck, yeah.
[109:21.80]Yeah, I fucked us.
[109:24.61]Oh.
[109:24.77]I fucked us all.
[109:26.31]It's almost as if having the blueprint... One of us made a mistake here.
[109:31.12]one of us somebody did something wrong not sure who it was but one of us somebody makes a mistake I think then this wall is also wrong 94 I'll spin it gotta be purple purple on the empty spot on the left if anybody wants to uh move you could do it no I'll get it it's fine oh you got it
[110:03.02]Get those paint cans.
[110:09.42]One, two, yeah, three stars.
[110:15.33]Listen, if we got personal scores, mine would be highest.
[110:19.21]That's, uh, I don't mean me.
[110:23.61]That's a koala?
[110:25.25]Hey, that last one on the end, is that extra skeleton bug Millennium Boy?
[110:30.47]Uh, what?
[110:31.85]I want to be the koala.
[110:32.57]The outline.
[110:33.78]You can't just have the new one every single time.
[110:35.96]Yes, I can.
[110:36.40]Alright, let's just make it confusing.
[110:41.90]We'll all be koalas.
[110:42.96]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[110:44.06]All koalas the same color.
[110:47.64]Star?
[110:48.74]I'm, no, as I said, my body type is an otter.
[110:51.78]I can't be the one you are.
[110:53.08]Oh, you can't be the same one.
[110:55.11]Oh.
[110:55.53]Yeah, I can be, um, any other one, though.
[111:00.30]You're just confusing people.
[111:01.56]Alright, I'll be the dog again.
[111:09.09]Fine.
[111:12.91]Uh, I'll be this one.
[111:20.45]Look at the vanity here.
[111:22.53]We need 37 to go up that floor, by the way.
[111:25.71]Of course.
[111:26.11]Oh, there's a door open.
[111:29.72]Oh, there is?
[111:31.12]Oh, yeah, there is.
[111:31.98]Number 14?
[111:32.24]You need 37 stars to reach this floor.
[111:36.35]Oh, that's to go up to the next one.
[111:40.41]Correct, yes.
[111:42.01]Alright, cool.
[111:45.15]What do we got?
[111:48.53]Oh, there's a kitchen.
[111:49.82]Nice island.
[111:52.78]Did you know that koalas are really close to extinction?
[111:56.04]We don't have blueprint?
[111:57.66]Yeah, I was actually told this...
[112:00.06]Maybe if they all just got jobs helping people move into their new homes like this koala.
[112:08.65]Just start taking off the wallpaper, because it's gonna ask us to.
[112:12.39]Yeah.
[112:14.25]Oh, no, actually, from what I was told, and I did a little research myself, koalas have smooth brains.
[112:19.16]And they will not eat food if it's on a table.
[112:22.04]They don't get it.
[112:23.08]It's not, like, on the tree, so they will literally starve to death if you feed them their koala food on a table.
[112:31.72]And apparently they just have sex with each other so much that they just... No, this is not even a joke.
[112:38.24]Like, there's so many, like, koala STDs.
[112:43.76]Did you learn any of those meerkat facts?
[112:47.17]Why is this going outside?
[112:48.73]I don't know.
[112:49.53]I just felt like the appropriate place to put it.
[112:52.17]I was just following your lead.
[112:54.05]Alright, so what's, uh... Where's the plan?
[112:58.79]The plan's in the dumpster?
[113:00.41]It looks like the plan's in the dumpster, yeah.
[113:01.87]I don't think we have a plan.
[113:03.67]I think we might be waiting for a delivery, either that, or we just need to, like, trial and error, and that would be really fun.
[113:10.83]Oh, boy.
[113:11.49]Okay.
[113:11.87]Well... Do we have a... Oh.
[113:12.93]Hey, I'm going to imagine that we glue these to this wall.
[113:16.43]I'm just going to... I'm going to... Well, it looks like... Yeah.
[113:18.85]I bet that's what the game wants you to do.
[113:20.39]We actually probably need to glue them to the top left wall.
[113:22.97]I think that's the only thing we have, but what about the purple paint?
[113:26.47]Alright.
[113:29.11]Try top left.
[113:30.79]I'm gonna try purple paint here.
[113:34.39]Oh, is it carpet?
[113:35.31]Alright, purple top left.
[113:37.65]Okay, let's give it a try.
[113:48.43]Progress is zero.
[113:51.05]I got progress for this.
[113:52.31]You got progress for that?
[113:53.15]This is probably bottom left.
[113:55.07]Yeah, this is definitely bottom left.
[113:56.11]Alright.
[113:56.39]So what would be top left?
[113:58.95]The green?
[114:00.49]The carpet?
[114:01.05]No, where's the carpet go?
[114:02.25]We probably don't have the ingredient yet.
[114:03.62]There it is.
[114:06.26]Yeah, that's top left.
[114:08.46]Yeah, let's try that.
[114:17.77]Hey, it worked.
[114:18.97]Look at us solving this difficult puzzle.
[114:23.27]It is a puzzle.
[114:26.43]if only they put like another couple million into the budget of this game I I'm not kidding if it was a game where you did this but it was not just like a fun little co-op game no no no like you have to build a whole house how much was this game uh twenty dollars okay only one of us had to buy it that's true
[114:54.11]Okay, considering that this is like $7 per person.
[115:00.37]Honestly, this game has... Oh no, I can't say that.
[115:04.05]Never mind.
[115:06.97]Are you getting progress by doing that?
[115:08.01]Have you checked?
[115:08.43]Yeah.
[115:09.79]Okay, good.
[115:10.41]Okay, just checking.
[115:11.30]Good, good, good, good.
[115:12.12]Very good.
[115:13.90]I'm gonna start trashing the walls over here.
[115:17.58]I'm gonna start throwing up.
[115:20.80]Why?
[115:29.35]Missing a wall in the top left room.
[115:32.01]We probably should spin it, to be honest.
[115:37.44]Honestly, you want to be really honest?
[115:39.58]Let's just one-spin it.
[115:40.46]We can't spin it.
[115:42.36]Oh, no, we can't spin it because there's no blueprint.
[115:44.76]There is no blueprint.
[115:45.74]Oh, shit.
[115:46.32]Okay, so we have to... Get some paste.
[115:50.26]Do we have all the trash from this bottom left room?
[115:53.33]No.
[115:54.09]These bottom walls...
[115:59.10]Also, don't koalas eat eucalyptus leaves, which is, like, poisonous?
[116:03.58]Are we still on the koalas?
[116:04.92]No, no.
[116:05.68]Yeah.
[116:08.37]That's their main source of food, is eucalyptus, and it's poison.
[116:11.91]But over years and decades, their stomachs have been able to digest it.
[116:18.53]So we're doing what?
[116:20.96]What?
[116:21.88]We need to do this bottom left room with the teal paper.
[116:25.34]Glue.
[116:25.72]Glue.
[116:27.68]Hey, thank you, Utopia Fox.
[116:29.34]Utopia Fox.
[116:31.44]Utopia Fox.
[116:33.90]For the five community subs, thank you.
[116:35.76]Utopia Fox.
[116:37.84]Thank you.
[116:41.40]You guys, are we getting progress on that?
[116:43.55]Yeah.
[116:44.09]Alright, I'm going to start cleaning.
[116:45.43]Are we getting progress on that?
[116:46.39]We have a room in the top left.
[116:47.63]We need the purple wallpaper to be up there.
[116:52.17]Oops.
[116:53.93]I skipped one.
[116:59.24]Uh, this music sounds like Civilization V music.
[117:04.10]Koalas can't eat eucalyptus at birth because they lack the proper enzymes.
[117:08.88]They have to obtain the enzymes by eating their mother's poo.
[117:13.81]Oh!
[117:17.19]What if they're, like... What if they don't have a mother?
[117:24.53]They were immaculately conceived, and we might have missed Jesus Koala at some point.
[117:29.50]No, no, there was a lab involved.
[117:32.40]What are you doing?
[117:33.88]Thank you, Utopia Fox.
[117:35.24]Go get the fucking paper!
[117:37.28]I'm talking.
[117:38.61]Okay, I'm sorry.
[117:40.43]I'm a koala.
[117:41.31]Standing in the middle of the floor, not helping anyone.
[117:44.74]What do koalas make for a noise?
[117:46.52]With 27 seconds left, might I add, looking up koala facts in his chat.
[117:52.02]I think all you've done is move the thing further away.
[117:55.56]Start cleaning up.
[117:56.85]Oh, sorry.
[117:57.21]There's a wall missing.
[117:59.39]Jerem must just stand in the middle of the floor and I'm getting called out for helping you.
[118:02.93]Oh, I don't know who's who.
[118:04.11]You all changed.
[118:05.15]Can I eat this?
[118:08.91]Oh, shit.
[118:09.19]We do have four seconds left.
[118:10.29]I'm sorry.
[118:10.67]Oh, yeah.
[118:11.25]Oh, four seconds left.
[118:12.21]Oh, my God.
[118:12.73]Now I care.
[118:15.05]This guy, he went to college.
[118:18.55]You keep bringing that up.
[118:21.57]Hey, not all of us are in the top 1% of the educated elite that go to college for this shit.
[118:31.32]Hey, you, hey.
[118:32.96]Oh, you're going to talk down to me now, fucking college boy.
[118:35.74]Quiet, quiet, quiet.
[118:41.27]college boy yeah college boy hey college boy are you my father on our weekly Sunday phone call when I was in college being considered a college boy hey college boy boomer like usual these walls need to come on that door needs to be answered
[119:04.07]Do we have a blueprint this time?
[119:06.27]Which one are you now, Jerma?
[119:07.61]Are you the other?
[119:08.19]You're the koala.
[119:08.95]I'm the koala.
[119:09.85]I've been the dog for like four missions.
[119:13.75]Okay.
[119:15.50]That's supposed to mean something to me.
[119:16.84]What do we do with the bag of flour?
[119:18.94]What do we do with the locked bag of flour?
[119:20.66]There's a lot of locked ingredients.
[119:22.72]I've heard you're supposed to drink it and don't come into work tomorrow.
[119:26.30]Oh, I have heard that too.
[119:29.72]Someone very wise said that.
[119:37.78]Okay, this is our ingredient room.
[119:40.96]Top left is that carpet that you just put down.
[119:43.78]Top left is that carpet.
[119:45.06]Top left.
[119:46.74]Which one?
[119:47.56]Fuchsia?
[119:48.58]That one.
[119:48.98]That one.
[119:49.42]You got it.
[119:49.82]You got it, bud.
[119:50.32]I got it.
[119:50.64]I'm doing it.
[119:51.18]You guys take care of the other shit.
[119:52.74]Do we have any more trash that needs to be peeled off walls?
[119:56.21]I don't think so.
[119:59.99]Do we have a mix yet?
[120:02.97]There's a bag of that mix stuff in that right room.
[120:10.08]Now, whatever that's for, I don't know.
[120:17.56]Oh.
[120:20.12]What's the box?
[120:20.66]Did I do this wrong?
[120:22.09]What's this box?
[120:23.39]I just have an indicator over here.
[120:26.49]Pull... Take this box to the rightmost room.
[120:32.25]Hold on.
[120:32.89]You want this box over there?
[120:34.63]Yeah, that little...
[120:37.86]Just, you get it.
[120:39.29]It's right there.
[120:40.77]Can you knock it out now?
[120:42.65]Hold on.
[120:43.07]Are you stuck?
[120:43.59]I just gotta put... I just gotta put that... Oh, these are like... They're wall tiles.
[120:47.85]Okay, I get it.
[120:49.19]Here you go.
[120:49.49]Alright, we have to do the same thing, though.
[120:50.97]It dries, so you need a second person to... I'm almost done here, then I'll be in there with you, Chief.
[120:56.61]I'm gonna paint this top left room.
[120:58.29]You guys take care of that.
[121:00.67]Sounds good to me.
[121:02.82]I'm with you, Chief.
[121:05.24]What do you need me to do?
[121:06.64]Just pick up the box stuff and then put it on the... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[121:15.63]Okay, chief.
[121:22.57]It's one-word catchphrase stuff.
[121:28.84]Whoops, that was not, uh... Top left room is done.
[121:35.09]I don't think we need this fuchsia paint anymore, do we?
[121:39.19]Don't think so.
[121:39.75]I'm gonna give you a... You guys need to turn?
[121:42.01]Uh, yeah.
[121:48.67]Yeah, that's it after that.
[121:49.59]You guys are done after that.
[121:50.29]Then I'm just gonna start cleaning up.
[121:53.25]That's a three star.
[121:54.85]What do I have?
[121:56.63]I think I have tiles.
[121:57.91]You do have tiles.
[122:08.65]There we go.
[122:09.19]Yeah, we mixed it up at the end.
[122:10.55]There's just some construction puke over here.
[122:17.17]And there's that one bundle.
[122:18.49]You want to put it on that final wall.
[122:22.58]Oh.
[122:23.22]Oh.
[122:23.96]Oh, shit, dude.
[122:26.76]Oh, shit.
[122:29.40]Oh, shit.
[122:31.02]Oh.
[122:32.02]Oh, what the fuck?
[122:34.82]Oh, shit, dude.
[122:37.57]Oh, oh!
[122:38.79]Someone get the door!
[122:40.93]Oh, shit, dude!
[122:44.72]Koala!
[122:46.08]Koala, help!
[122:47.62]Oh, shit!
[122:50.16]Jesus.
[122:50.90]Am I watching like a college drinking compilation where somebody chugs real fast?
[122:55.77]What are you doing?
[122:56.93]Get out here.
[122:57.69]Get outside!
[122:58.37]There's a minute.
[122:59.77]Put me down.
[123:00.19]It was just recording for royalty-free party ambiance sound effects.
[123:08.74]you good what if you say college boy you guys have to finish that wall I'm getting to it dad there's still one more thing so can we get some rotations it's this door no you need rotations oh there's another wall here another wall right here right here right here on me there it is
[123:43.26]Just you two?
[123:46.42]Yeah.
[123:47.00]Damn.
[123:53.27]Pretty good.
[123:54.01]Nice work, guys.
[123:55.45]We need 37.
[123:55.75]We have to.
[123:56.41]Hey, good job.
[123:57.63]We don't even get paid for this.
[124:03.03]How many floors are there?
[124:05.62]Well, the achievement was halfway there.
[124:07.36]199.
[124:07.38]No, 999. 999.
[124:14.69]This game is a testament that a couple of, you know, a couple of farm boys can work with one city slicker.
[124:21.15]You know what I'm talking about?
[124:23.43]We had trouble saying that for some reason.
[124:24.91]Why?
[124:25.11]That we can work together with the social elite.
[124:29.31]I think it's actually the opposite because I went to college.
[124:32.62]So it's two college boys trying to teach one farm boy how to actually do things.
[124:37.52]We can't get this out of this room.
[124:39.66]Free education.
[124:40.18]Then don't.
[124:44.04]Does the queen live here?
[124:44.98]Where are you trying to move this?
[124:48.86]Just out of the way so we can start to do this.
[124:51.06]It's in the way now.
[124:53.52]It is in the way now.
[124:54.88]Oh, just restart.
[124:55.81]Yeah, this is going to be a pain in the ass.
[125:04.31]Just rotate it so we can walk by and just...
[125:07.65]There.
[125:08.89]Diagonally.
[125:09.99]Diagonal.
[125:11.11]Diagonal.

[125:13.65]You're pushing.
[125:16.13]Alright.

[125:17.69]Wow.
[125:17.85]Look at those two college boys work together on that one.
[125:21.97]That's this floor up here.
[125:26.70]So that's... It's already been shellacked.
[125:28.40]There's no shellack.
[125:31.52]So just do it.
[125:34.36]Just flick their heads.
[125:42.74]We need some couch movement, I think, here in a minute.
[125:48.77]If anyone touches this couch, I'm screaming.
[125:51.43]There's one behind the top right and the top left.
[125:53.97]If you touch this couch... Oh, my God.
[125:56.77]Someone get the fucking door.

[128:10.90]I'm currently being yelled at, so.
[128:13.70]Sorry, what?
[128:17.25]This thing's not supposed to be up here.
[128:18.39]Okay, I'm just holding this up in the air while you guys do the tiles underneath it.
[128:27.62]All the lactic acid is built up.
[128:29.26]I'm going to have to scream here in a second.
[128:36.08]Okay.
[128:37.60]Now we got to move the table again after we get this... We got to get this tile down.
[128:42.76]I'm going for it.
[128:47.30]I always want the tile on this guy.
[128:48.76]Did you intentionally lock us back here?
[128:50.72]Somebody might be mad.
[128:57.73]We're missing tile for this bottom room.
[128:59.21]There's a bottom left room that needs to be done.
[129:01.87]We don't have the tile for it.
[129:03.33]There's tile in the top right room or something.
[129:05.49]Oh, there is?
[129:06.53]Yeah, we need that tile in there.
[129:08.96]Alright, Chief.
[129:10.70]You need this tile in there?
[129:12.22]Or that tile over here?
[129:13.04]Alright.
[129:14.32]I'm going to start clearing out.
[129:15.14]I'm going to start clearing shit out.
[129:17.52]So we don't need anymore.
[129:19.66]Alright, chief.
[129:23.56]I can't wait till you progress.
[129:24.40]There's a large bed in here.
[129:25.56]To like buddy.
[129:27.04]Or like guy or something.
[129:28.61]Alright, buddy.
[129:29.71]What?
[129:32.01]Did you not hear?
[129:32.93]You keep just changing words.
[129:35.61]You didn't hear the news?
[129:36.47]Alright, pull the bed.
[129:39.01]There's no genders anymore.
[129:40.21]There's only sports.
[129:41.03]Okay, but pull the bed in such a way that I can get in there.
[129:49.57]Just place it on this front one, even though it's going to block you.
[129:57.28]I'm trying.
[129:57.84]I'm going to crush him.
[130:01.33]We're actually about to throw it over the edge.
[130:04.95]Alright, there we go.
[130:05.49]Good.
[130:09.73]I feel like I am playing Minecraft again.
[130:12.39]I went AFK and when I came back, somebody boxed me in with no tools.
[130:16.01]We have to put tiles down in the room.
[130:17.77]Just lean the bed up into the ceiling.
[130:24.97]This is ultra lazy.
[130:27.10]You don't want to take the bed apart to clear the room.
[130:30.00]We got 50 seconds and we're missing something.
[130:34.28]What are we missing?
[130:35.56]Kitchen.
[130:36.22]It might be that.
[130:36.78]It hasn't dried?
[130:38.02]Okay.
[130:38.48]It didn't dry.
[130:40.77]Okay, we gotta start cleaning up.
[130:41.95]Oh my, he's getting it.
[130:43.55]Make room for the bed.
[130:48.05]Can you just come out?
[130:49.05]Free bed, free bed, free bed.
[130:50.77]Are you seriously not, don't want a free bed?
[130:52.32]Open that door right now.
[130:57.44]Are we stealing from them?
[131:03.53]That's just perpetuating, you know.
[131:05.97]That's right.
[131:06.43]A long-standing myth.
[131:09.41]That is stealing.
[131:10.03]Yeah, you said we weren't getting paid.
[131:12.45]That's a fee.
[131:14.05]That moving people are just animal people.
[131:16.75]Like otters.
[131:18.95]What do we need?
[131:20.20]This one is large, but I think it's fake large.
[131:25.52]I think two people could do this one.
[131:26.98]You know what I mean?
[131:27.46]Fake large.
[131:28.02]Kind of like when I puff out my stomach to look fatter.
[131:31.12]Yeah.
[131:38.75]Or just sit normally.
[131:40.27]Alright, what's the goal?
[131:49.86]Hold on, I don't think he processed it.
[131:51.90]It's alright.
[131:53.86]I'm muted right now.
[131:54.64]I don't think he processed that.
[131:56.08]And tear down these walls.
[131:57.33]Okay, I gotta compose myself because I can't laugh at that.
[132:08.14]Anyone want to do something?
[132:10.90]I don't know what the, what are we supposed to do?
[132:12.52]Tear down these walls!
[132:13.24]That was really mean.
[132:15.24]Okay.
[132:16.04]That's not what I was trying to say.
[132:17.34]Answer the door?
[132:18.52]Answer the door.
[132:19.12]Alright, I got pizza.
[132:20.84]What is this?
[132:23.56]I think we, I think, okay, next game.
[132:25.20]I think we're done.
[132:29.57]You do, hey, you do know what the next game is, right?
[132:32.73]The next game is like this game, but different.
[132:34.75]The next game is like this, except it's a train instead of a house.
[132:43.84]Look, you guys are doing nothing.
[132:46.16]I know, I know.
[132:47.08]Wait, wait.
[132:47.82]No, I'm not done.
[132:48.78]I'm not done.
[132:49.54]Who's done here?
[132:50.65]Hold on.
[132:50.97]Who's done here?
[132:52.63]I was done an hour ago.

[133:05.21]You have to stay.
[133:09.30]Okay.
[133:12.84]Alright, this is my swing vote, though.
[133:16.17]If there's not a new mechanic by the next floor, I'm done.
[133:19.79]Okay.
[133:21.81]Well, the mechanic this floor is moving furniture.
[133:29.45]Oh, no, we have... But we've got a backup thing.
[133:31.94]Okay, start tearing down these walls.
[133:34.00]Okay, tear down the walls.
[133:35.74]Get the garbage can that you already put shit in.
[133:43.25]Oh, it's empty.
[133:45.29]There.
[133:49.22]Okay.
[133:52.10]The train one actually looks really fun too, though.
[133:54.56]Yeah, the train game does look pretty fun.
[133:56.84]You guys don't even know what the train game is, do you?
[134:02.49]I do.
[134:05.21]We want it now.
[134:05.69]Because I linked it to you.
[134:07.65]When do we want justice?

[134:43.30]Which one's the kitchen?
[134:43.88]Why is it floorboard?
[134:44.80]It's got like a floorboard.
[134:46.02]Look.
[134:47.04]Is it here?
[134:48.00]Is this a kitchen?
[134:48.54]It just keeps bringing things.
[134:51.30]Which is... What's the kitchen?
[134:53.14]So many things.
[134:53.98]Alright.
[134:57.02]I don't... I think this is a kitchen.

[135:00.94]Wait, that's floorboard.
[135:02.04]What's this?
[135:06.31]Yeah, that's not... That carpet doesn't go there.
[135:08.89]That thing you're carrying goes in the room Jermazin.
[135:13.29]It goes in the... Are you sure that's not it?
[135:15.08]Oh, no, that... Wait, wait, wait.
[135:16.08]This is it.
[135:16.92]It goes in here.
[135:18.02]No, it's not.
[135:18.50]It's wrong.
[135:18.98]We haven't made any progress.
[135:20.26]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[135:21.80]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[135:22.50]This is right, but the percentage didn't go up.
[135:26.20]Is this right?
[135:28.59]That's definitely right, though.
[135:34.69]The percentage isn't going up at all.
[135:37.85]Maybe it's because we smell?
[135:38.93]Did we not tear something off?
[135:43.57]I mean, that's exactly the way it's supposed to look.
[135:48.61]We didn't shellac... Maybe there's so many things to do that my feeble wall painting is not good enough to do.
[135:55.65]Yeah, but the individual thing on here would show progress, but it doesn't.
[136:02.90]This room's done.
[136:03.40]The second blueprint...
[136:05.44]Are they different?
[136:06.98]This one's dumb.
[136:08.15]How will we... Oh, no.
[136:09.23]Okay, wait.
[136:09.63]No.
[136:09.75]We're going, I guess.
[136:10.89]Oh, they're high.
[136:11.75]There's one high, one low.
[136:13.17]There's two different blueprints.
[136:15.85]There's two different blueprints, and one of them's false?
[136:19.63]We have fake blueprints now.
[136:22.55]We got fucking tricked.
[136:26.19]So there is a rival company actively trying to sabotage us.
[136:29.89]What the fuck?
[136:31.11]Well, that's a new mechanic, but I don't know if I like it.
[136:34.73]I don't know if I like it.
[136:35.85]It's just a time waster.
[136:37.21]You just restart at that point.
[136:40.33]And then you play the train game where you're like, go to bed.
[136:42.37]Alright, it's train game time.
[136:44.01]Where's the latte wallpaper?
[136:48.57]Where's, like, the latte wallpaper?
[136:55.12]Do we have latte wallpaper?
[136:59.14]Holy shit, dude.
[137:00.04]That was violent.
[137:08.48]It's just sad.
[137:14.51]Watching him just keep slipping in the back corner.
[137:21.48]He's just making a mess to try to get us to do the train game.
[137:24.90]Yeah.
[137:25.10]He wants to leave.
[137:25.76]Alright.
[137:27.02]Train game.
[137:27.66]He wants to... Alright.
[137:28.42]Fine.
[137:30.42]Fine.
[137:32.11]This was called Tools Up.
[137:34.87]So...
[137:37.65]We're gonna do train game.
[137:39.46]And I'm gonna go to VRB screen and I'm gonna go pee.
[137:42.18]And then we'll open it up.
[137:45.06]Oh my god, he pees once every two hours?
[137:47.10]It's not true, I didn't pee for eight hours last night.
[137:50.00]Literally, last night I didn't go to the bathroom once.
[137:52.42]Is that the first night you haven't wet the bed?
[137:54.82]In the last month?
[137:55.56]Mute them both.
[137:57.80]Alright, I'm gonna go pee.
[137:58.76]What do you mean you don't have train game in you?
[138:01.62]Dude, it's dinner time.
[138:05.10]Why do you guys gotta start so late?
[138:10.46]It's not even late.
[138:11.26]It's 3 o'clock.
[138:11.76]It was 3... It was like 4 or 5 o'clock.
[138:15.48]That's late.
[138:17.02]Then you have to do time zones, and then consider what time it is in Europe.
[138:20.76]Do you have sleep apnea?
[138:22.98]No.
[138:24.14]I've just been waking up really early.
[138:25.54]No, he just wants to go to bed at 6.30, 7 o'clock at night.
[138:29.22]That's what it is.
[138:34.44]Do you go to get the early bird special at your local diner too with all the other old people?

[138:52.91]Early bird scrambled eggs.
[138:54.93]It's just gonna be a full plate of scrambled eggs.
[138:56.65]You're not gonna order anything else, and then you're just gonna be like, this is what I like.
