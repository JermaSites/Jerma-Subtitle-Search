[00:02.46]Hey, is the beard a bit?
[00:04.61]Ah, kind of.
[00:05.29]It's a bit for me.
[00:08.57]It's a bit to see what even happens, because I've never gone past the point of no return.
[00:17.49]So we'll see.
[00:40.23]There we go.
[00:45.59]Okay, this game is... I have no idea.
[00:50.82]Time until... Wait, what?
[00:52.64]There's a countdown for the next update?
[00:57.04]That's kind of cool.
[00:58.29]Are you serious?
[01:04.57]I wonder how long this has been up here for.
[01:08.82]Look.
[01:10.99]time until alpha 0.9 I'm playing it too early should I play it tomorrow what if I miss out on a huge update well we'll see we'll check the pre-update
[01:33.18]Alright, this game is a survival game.
[01:37.49]I'm just going to do new game.
[01:38.55]I think you build stuff and you have to use P. We'll find out.
[01:50.19]This is a P game.
[01:51.09]This is a P-based video game.
[01:52.59]Yes.
[02:06.54]Okay, my computer hard crashed and then turned back on.
[02:14.70]What happened to the stream?
[02:16.06]Did you guys see that?
[02:19.76]I swear I heard like a... Are we good?
[02:29.38]Oh my god, it is lagging wicked bad.
[02:43.80]What should I put it on?
[02:54.88]Is that better?
[03:00.45]VSync expensive?
[03:03.69]Wouldn't you want VSync on?
[03:07.09]Is that better?
[03:07.48]I feel like I'm in like a wind tunnel.
[03:16.52]What's the FOV?
[03:29.74]Uh... Bog quality.
[03:31.93]We'll take the bloom off.
[03:37.20]Brass distance.
[03:39.08]Brass density.
[03:41.24]Okay.
[03:41.96]Shadows.
[03:42.54]Put them high.
[03:45.57]3D terrain?
[03:46.67]That's fine, right?
[03:49.39]Is it better?
[03:56.72]Vsync was the problem?
[03:59.22]We're good, right?
[03:59.86]Is it better?
[04:00.24]60 FPS?
[04:03.69]Okay.
[04:06.57]Play cassette.
[04:08.35]I'm not holding a cassette.
[04:09.57]Alright.
[04:11.86]Duct tape.
[04:16.06]Why am I... I'm dressed like the guy from... What the hell is the... The Little Monkey?
[04:23.64]Wait, don't tell me.
[04:26.11]I gotta think of the song and then I'll... Curious George, the curious little monkey.
[04:31.08]Okay, it's Curious George.
[04:37.90]I thought that was... I just spit everything that scared the shit out of me.
[04:41.78]I thought that was either a guy looking at me in a mirror.
[04:44.66]I thought that was a guy looking in the window.
[04:46.37]Ugh.
[04:49.63]I thought that was somebody peering into the window.
[04:51.65]Or, like, a mirror.
[04:54.01]That was very weird.
[04:58.06]What is this?
[05:01.48]Wasted 24-7?
[05:02.74]I'm going with or without you.
[05:09.32]Why we just get scary music?
[05:20.83]What's that up there?
[05:22.57]Plastic bottle.
[05:27.48]Okay, there is a punch.
[05:28.36]Does it hurt my hand?
[05:37.23]I hope not.
[05:39.74]Phone, sink.
[05:41.16]Do I have, wait, take cloth.
[05:43.89]Do I have a, uh, inventory or something?
[05:45.59]Okay, I can build.
[05:47.67]Stats.
[05:48.80]Addiction?
[05:52.46]Guns?
[05:53.22]Okay, this game's elaborate.
[05:54.52]I'm interested.
[05:56.85]Okay.
[06:03.22]Cloth.
[06:08.95]What's my objective right now?
[06:10.41]Do I have like an objective list?
[06:15.86]Candy bar?
[06:18.77]Nice fucking stream title.
[06:20.05]Honk.
[06:26.50]Yeah, you like it?
[06:27.92]What does it say?
[06:30.03]Pretty Derpy Racing Time.
[06:31.49]Why is that the title?
[06:32.25]Oh, that's not the title.
[06:35.01]BRB, gotta go pee.
[06:38.45]That's a good one.
[06:39.05]I like that one.
[06:46.83]Alright, I got a lot of materials.
[06:56.17]There's a sprint, which is good.
[06:58.15]Whoa, whoa!
[07:03.63]dude I had a fight with a mosquito did you remember I talked about there was a mosquito in the house remember I told you this I said there was a mosquito in the house I spent all day hunting this mosquito yesterday I'm not kidding there was one mosquito
[07:23.51]He bit me on my foot and I was, I had to get rid of this guy.
[07:27.63]I had to get rid of this mosquito.
[07:30.82]He showed up, he would float around and I'd catch him and I'd go, you motherfucker.
[07:34.68]And then he'd be gone and I freaked because the one thing about a mosquito is when you know that they're around, it is a harrowing experience because you know they're going to try to bite you at some point and you can hear them.
[07:51.48]You hear the
[07:54.89]And it's like, I'm freaking, I get away from me.
[07:57.88]Because it's not just an innocent little gnat or a fly, which is, I'm just a dumb fly.
[08:02.46]And I run into stuff and I run into the window.
[08:05.24]They are coming to bite you.
[08:06.46]They want to hurt you.
[08:08.39]So, oh, you have no idea.
[08:11.87]I spent at least an hour or two sitting in the corner of this room, standing in the corner of the room with a coffee, with my glasses on, waiting to see movement.
[08:24.16]And I caught him three or four times.
[08:26.60]And I lost him.
[08:28.50]And then... I got him.
[08:31.36]And the reason why I got him is because my coffee... I did put a little bit of creamer in this coffee.
[08:35.83]And the heat and the sugar attracted him to the cup.
[08:38.63]And I saw that he landed right next to the cup.
[08:41.20]He was hovering around it.
[08:42.12]And I was like, I got you, motherfucker.
[08:43.44]It's over.
[08:45.18]And I got him.
[08:51.37]Did I just leave?
[08:57.67]Well, it's plus one full letter grade.
[08:59.35]We have to be fair.
[09:01.83]Where am I?
[09:02.39]Where do I go?
[09:04.50]Where am I supposed to go?
[09:05.60]Do I leave this house?
[09:11.71]Who's that?
[09:12.99]Hey!
[09:20.86]What is going on?
[09:22.14]Why is there a tour bus?
[09:25.77]Ah!
[09:26.05]Ah!
[09:26.74]I can't look at chat.
[09:27.59]I can't look at chat.
[09:33.49]Do I chase that person down?
[09:36.80]Why would they be a boost on like a Camry?
[09:47.47]Where am I supposed to go?
[09:51.76]Pissing on the ground is not advised.
[09:53.56]Did I just pee in my seat?
[10:06.87]Why would you do that?
[10:28.12]You lost him.
[10:28.92]Wait, did I fuck up the whole game?
[10:33.06]I softlocked- I hardlocked the game!
[10:38.99]I hardlocked it.
[10:40.61]I can't even leave.
[10:42.41]I never saved it.
[10:45.54]I pissed my pants.
[10:46.62]It crashed.
[10:52.63]There's no auto-save?
[10:55.23]Oh, shit.
[11:02.22]That gave me chest pains.
[11:06.49]Okay, there is no autosave.
[11:08.17]Or if there is, I didn't even hit... Oh shit, my computer's freaking out again.
[11:17.74]There's something about this game loading shades at the beginning.
[11:20.99]It's fried up.
[11:29.60]Did it reset the graphics settings?
[11:33.52]It reset... I didn't even save graphics.
[11:38.08]Something about that is so funny.
[11:39.84]Okay, I gotta turn it off.
[11:41.99]Resync.
[11:43.47]Make the f- Shadow quality high.
[11:49.92]This is fine, right?
[11:51.08]Turn the bloom off.
[11:58.51]We're better, right?
[12:01.17]Okay, well shit, I gotta- I actually took physical damage from what just happened.
[12:08.44]How did I... How did I do that?
[12:15.61]Oh my god.
[12:16.27]Okay, so here it is.
[12:17.92]I'm going with or without you.
[12:20.28]Okay.
[12:27.32]Interact with switch.
[12:37.30]God, it's still in me.
[12:42.95]I can't.
[12:43.65]It's still affecting me.
[12:45.29]The residual pee car crash is still in me.
[12:48.25]It's still fucking with me.
[12:53.08]Is that pee fumes?
[13:04.80]Oh.
[13:07.66]I, like, swallowed my coffee spit the wrong way.
[13:11.98]And it's doing poison damage to me.
[13:18.43]I sound like the Tarkov people.
[13:20.20]When you're in Tarkov, and you guys really hurt.
[13:31.74]Okay, yes.
[13:40.93]You watch poke play.
[13:43.39]My only experience with Tarkov is watching poke play the game.
[13:48.58]I have, by the way, let me just say this.
[13:51.64]I have absolutely no fucking idea what is going on in that game.
[13:58.99]What anyone is doing.
[14:00.97]I don't understand it at all.
[14:02.91]0.0.
[14:03.85]And I've watched probably like 50 hours of people play it.
[14:07.86]I have no idea what happens.
[14:10.75]It's a extraction loot game.
[14:13.67]I don't even understand how that works either.
[14:15.84]Oh, we're going on a raid.
[14:18.66]Okay, what's that mean?
[14:21.14]Well, you just went somewhere.
[14:23.49]Oh, I got to get out before this.
[14:24.63]Oh, that's a scrapper.
[14:26.65]That's a scavenger.
[14:29.30]Oh, okay.
[14:30.82]Are you a scavenger?
[14:33.34]I don't understand it at all.
[14:34.60]They change maps.
[14:35.83]Sometimes they die.
[14:40.33]I don't get it.
[14:41.51]I like when people like things.
[14:58.78]Why?
[14:59.16]That's the whole video?
[15:09.97]How do I stop playing it?
[15:12.55]Oh, like that.
[15:13.75]Alright, I'm going.
[15:18.28]I know what I gotta do this time.
[15:19.36]Save the game.
[15:21.01]I can't save it.
[15:27.22]Okay, don't fuck this up.
[15:52.84]Alright, stay on him.
[15:57.05]Don't boost.
[15:57.81]I just have to stay relatively behind him.
[16:11.35]What if he crashes?
[16:29.41]What the fuck?
[16:43.97]He was rubber banding in a single-player game!
[16:46.76]Did I lose?
[16:57.83]Where the fuck am I?
[16:59.19]Ah!
[17:01.18]Come on!
[17:02.00]Come at me all you fucking creatures!
[17:12.90]I don't have any friends.
[17:14.52]I just killed all my friends there.
[17:16.48]What if I could have fr- I should have left one!
[17:30.89]Save it.
[17:54.08]Okay.
[17:54.20]This guy's got a strong stream, holy shit!
[17:59.59]He can move furniture with his piss!
[18:05.48]That's a hydrated individual.
[18:11.63]What's that?
[18:12.43]Just drugs?
[18:15.13]What is this?
[18:15.83]Is this cocaine?
[18:16.78]What is this?
[18:18.24]What did I just do?
[18:20.40]It's not dark enough.
[18:26.19]Okay, there's a guard.
[18:30.04]Oh, hold on.
[18:30.92]How do I guard?
[18:33.72]Hit, guard, hard hit.
[18:36.80]Forward.
[18:37.22]What is forward?
[18:40.71]Take herbal liquid.
[18:49.68]What am I making here?
[18:56.13]Yeah, it is the urge to piss.
[18:58.61]That is the game.
[19:02.74]I get- Maybe it's just open-ended now.
[19:04.06]I just gotta, like, kind of live?
[19:05.10]I don't know.
[19:08.69]Take a log.
[19:10.01]They all want the yellow stuff.
[19:11.99]Don't let the fog rise.
[19:13.71]Oh, I got meat now.
[19:27.57]Okay.
[19:30.60]Just the morning mist.
[19:38.50]Okay, I'm pissing up into the wind into my own face.
[19:41.32]That's pretty damn crazy.
[19:48.11]Hey, hey, hey.
[19:49.01]Don't piss into the wind and tell me it's raining.
[19:51.49]Right?
[20:04.24]Did I just scavenge?
[20:10.29]plywood stack of strong plates made out of thin wood plies key part of bases herbal liquid this is a healing potion build okay look at all this coal I need a bed roll an anti-fog tent should I just start chopping down trees or something
[20:52.65]I was like, what am I, a beaver?
[20:54.35]No, not on the house.
[20:55.11]Don't land on the house.
[20:55.87]Is that bad?
[21:06.05]Okay, I got wood.
[21:09.12]I'm going up there.
[21:26.01]I was hoping I could knock it down with the pee.
[21:29.97]More fog causes more enemies.
[21:32.34]Hazardous fog has reached 25%.
[21:34.24]Beware of the yellow dust.
[21:37.60]Did I only get one piece of wood out of that?
[21:42.51]Oh, wait a minute.
[21:43.15]Is me peeing a bad thing?
[21:48.82]There are enemies.
[21:51.00]Wait, I'm going in there.
[21:51.96]There's like a hut over here.
[22:04.96]I kind of like this as a little base.
[22:11.76]What should I craft?
[22:12.26]Should I craft something?
[22:12.94]I did craft something.
[22:22.07]Oh, this is a barbed wire.
[22:23.83]Okay, I need wire.
[22:25.90]This is a bedroll.
[22:28.88]Okay, I can make a campfire.
[22:31.42]It can be used for cooking.
[22:33.71]A trap?
[22:35.19]A cabin.
[22:35.91]Simple wooden shelter with no furniture.
[22:40.32]Okay, I need wire.
[22:41.24]What do I get?
[22:41.64]Wire?
[22:42.08]Okay, I need more duct tape.
[22:46.31]What was that?
[22:50.97]Wait, I can pee in this?
[22:52.98]I need more duct tape.
[22:53.82]Okay, I gotta go collect more supplies.
[22:58.72]Is this clean water?
[23:11.32]You can pee in anything.
[23:12.63]Yeah.
[23:17.83]It won't be clean for long.
[23:22.24]I think I have to make one of those tents.
[23:30.47]Where am I gonna get wire from?
[23:31.71]Is that a bird or a monster?
[23:43.96]Do I have a compass?
[23:44.64]I'm going to get lost.
[23:46.78]Maybe I just say fuck it and just build out in the open here somewhere.
[24:00.80]What is there?
[24:01.14]I wonder what the time is like.
[24:04.58]I'm fine.
[24:05.14]I'm fine.
[24:05.60]I can get guns too.
[24:07.74]Oh shit.
[24:08.16]Okay, there's more tabs.
[24:11.35]Handle.
[24:13.01]Arp it.
[24:15.21]Custom door.
[24:18.00]A crusher trap.
[24:25.68]A ladder.
[24:26.88]A log wall.
[24:28.15]Okay.
[24:30.09]I gotta get more materials though.
[24:39.30]That's boarded up.
[24:39.88]What about up here?
[24:41.92]I'll get some more wood.
[24:42.46]Let me get more wood.
[24:43.04]I feel like wood's gonna be very important to have a lot of it.
[24:52.66]Somebody said, I had a feeling this was a shitpost game, not a survival sim.
[24:57.15]How much inventory space do I have?
[25:10.31]It might be finite.
[25:12.77]Um, it's pretty good, I think.
[25:19.06]I got 14 logs.
[25:21.46]I gotta go into more... Okay, I went the complete wrong way.
[25:23.91]I gotta go into houses, I think.
[25:25.31]I thought you said you don't like survival games.
[25:34.12]That's true.
[25:35.76]But... When you add a piss mechanic... That adds some interest to the survival game.
[25:52.43]Let me go back to the house.
[25:53.15]There's probably stuff in the upstairs.
[25:59.78]I could deck this out and put board up windows and stuff.
[26:02.66]What's probably going to happen is you probably get Minecraft style attacked at night.
[26:09.07]It's probably something like that.
[26:11.85]Let me go back in the house.
[26:13.04]I didn't explore this fully.
[26:23.40]Okay, no.
[26:24.72]Can I do anything with these?
[26:30.01]Maybe I should break some of this stuff to get wire?
[26:32.11]If I break the computer... Okay, you can't break the computer.
[26:55.24]They knew what they were doing.
[27:01.89]Why would I sleep here instead of the bed?
[27:14.77]What time is it?
[27:19.39]Whoa.
[27:27.07]Can I pick any of this up?
[27:28.07]This looks like good shit.
[27:31.17]It was duct tape?
[27:32.11]Cloth?
[27:35.46]Don't breathe that in.
[27:36.60]That's the piss fumes.
[27:49.92]Okay, so you have to break things fully.
[27:54.04]Let me save it.
[28:04.16]Okay.
[28:11.81]Why he's gonna see the notification?
[28:15.43]What notification?
[28:17.34]I need to see a notification?
[28:18.80]Why is it telling me I'm peeing still?
[28:20.02]I haven't peed in like five seconds.
[28:27.27]Oh, wait.
[28:30.05]Spikes.
[28:31.66]Okay, maybe I should put some of these down.
[28:36.29]Alright, I'm gonna put some spikes down.
[28:38.81]At the front door?
[28:39.49]Do I treat this like Left 4 Dead?
[28:54.55]Can I go over that?
[28:58.04]Okay.
[28:58.16]Okay.
[29:04.13]Sometimes chatters are talking amongst themselves.
[29:07.31]That's true.
[29:07.86]Oh, there's stuff here.
[29:12.06]Plastic.
[29:12.72]I need wire.
[29:13.44]Anything in the trash?
[29:18.93]Glue?
[29:20.27]Somebody said something.
[29:21.03]Wait, it says something's wrong.
[29:24.40]Hazardous fog has reached 50%.
[29:25.98]Beware of the yellow dust.
[29:30.35]Okay, I gotta get ready.
[29:31.68]Mailbox.
[29:33.18]Anything, come on.
[29:34.16]I need another house.
[29:50.62]Give me some wire.
[29:53.26]There's gotta be wire in the car, right?
[30:02.82]I have this little goofy level 1 Diablo II axe.
[30:10.90]What the fuck is that?
[30:17.96]What is that?
[30:37.11]Oh big house right here.
[30:56.76]Pumpkins.
[31:02.90]Herbs?
[31:03.80]Ooh, coffee weed!
[31:05.48]Is that real?
[31:06.30]Can you make coffee with coffee weed?
[31:15.84]Hazardous fog meter.
[31:19.26]Does somebody live here?
[31:33.32]I need metal material.
[31:38.07]It's a church.
[31:39.33]Extractor?
[31:42.38]Extractor?
[31:43.72]What does that do?
[31:46.28]It can be used to extract resources from some items by combining them with this.
[31:54.22]Oh, I have coffee now.
[31:55.26]Wait, I filled the coffee with the bottle.
[32:03.28]Powder made from its roasted roots has been used as a coffee substitute.
[32:09.30]Okay, so I gotta make some shit then.
[32:10.72]I gotta build some things.
[32:19.85]Is it getting dark?
[32:23.01]House starter.
[32:30.40]Is it gonna make you piss more?
[32:34.41]Alright, I'm gonna- I'm at 75% right now.
[32:38.83]I am gonna- ooh.
[32:47.88]Do these count as enemies?
[32:49.97]My bladder's full.
[32:57.29]Does this count- are these the enemies in the game?
[32:59.14]It's a bunch of like spiders?
[33:01.58]Do they hurt you?
[33:04.87]Oh!
[33:08.50]Oh my god, this... Wait, the pee... I made those pee fumes.
[33:11.12]That was my bad.
[33:14.47]What'd I just get?
[33:15.01]Drains urine from your body frequently consuming will decrease your con... Wait.
[33:24.32]I can eat that.
[33:25.35]This makes me not have to pee as much?
[33:36.98]I'm gonna stay here for the night.
[33:49.06]Plastic bag, protein bar.
[33:50.84]What do you got in the fridge?
[33:53.94]Oh, that's a nightmare scenario.
[33:56.30]I just went over... The actual scenario of this just went over in my head like a hundred times.
[34:05.10]I'm not eating this protein bar.
[34:07.02]No chance.
[34:10.94]Ugh.
[34:15.13]I probably should put a board, like, board up the windows.
[34:27.35]This is what you get for chugging two gallons of kefir.
[34:29.55]Why are you not banned?
[34:33.14]What's that?
[34:33.52]What's happening?
[34:37.19]Is the house moving?
[34:38.87]Is this like Wizard of Oz?
[34:39.92]Why is the house moving?
[34:50.47]Sliding door.
[34:52.43]Save basin.
[35:02.12]I can't.
[35:02.48]I have no more room.
[35:04.14]I gotta build some shit.
[35:07.09]Ladder.
[35:08.54]Pillar.
[35:10.54]I can make another wall.
[35:13.81]I should make a campfire.
[35:19.18]How do I place wood in it?
[35:23.64]I can't take the alcohol?
[35:28.77]What can I make with this?
[35:30.12]Get the fuck away from me!
[35:35.73]Wait, I'm learning recipes.
[35:37.49]Okay.
[35:39.09]Duct tape and this makes what I make.
[35:51.79]Duct tape?
[35:53.79]Okay, hold on.
[35:54.89]I made a battery?
[35:55.77]Okay, what about plywood?
[36:03.84]And extractor is probably wood.
[36:08.17]flowers I can't combine anything cloth and duct tape I could do cloth and I just made a crossbow let's go how do I make bolts for it this looks like a toy okay how do I make bolts
[36:36.06]Wood and feathers.
[36:37.52]Okay, I gotta go.
[36:38.36]I have to go kill one of those gooses, unfortunately.
[36:40.80]I gotta go kill a goose.
[36:45.77]Is it safe?
[36:46.17]Should I leave?
[37:02.91]Ugh.
[37:05.68]I'm not even going to waste attacking them.
[37:10.90]I need to find... I think I have to find like a bird to kill.
[37:13.45]How am I going to catch a bird?
[37:25.04]How am I... I'm not going to be able to sneak up on a bird.
[37:26.99]With a toy axe.
[37:35.22]Oh, there's one.
[37:39.01]Are those birds?
[37:50.61]Okay, is that a bird or is that a... like a dog or a wolf or a... I thought that was a landmine.
[37:58.62]No, shit!
[37:59.46]Shit!
[38:15.79]I gotta pee.
[38:34.76]Are you friendly?
[38:35.48]Is he friendly?
[38:38.98]I don't want to hurt him.
[38:39.88]He's just a friendly little possum friend.
[38:42.45]What if he helps me?
[38:44.40]Alright, this is my new friend.
[38:46.31]We're going to fight the fucking zombies together.
[39:09.71]I can't go that way.
[39:12.55]No, don't leave me.
[39:13.77]Oh, this is opening.
[39:14.56]I can open it.
[39:23.41]Oh shit, I can take this.
[39:25.04]This game's cool.
[39:26.36]Uh, I'm gonna make... What should I make?
[39:30.51]What should I, uh, let's craft.
[39:32.68]I don't know.
[39:33.06]Let's see what it does.
[39:34.74]Okay, it makes wood.
[39:37.16]Fuck.
[39:38.34]Battery?
[39:39.46]Don't need it.
[39:41.47]Uh, what about the bag?
[39:43.79]You're off.
[39:44.55]Should I just take it?
[39:45.67]I'm gonna eat this.
[39:50.19]Okay, I ate it, and my P meter went down.
[39:52.20]Oh, you can't even see the P meter.
[39:56.02]There you go.
[40:03.28]I need organic waste.
[40:08.25]I guess you can cut down a lot of stuff.
[40:09.55]It's not just the wood.
[40:20.14]I wish I had a P-meter IRL.
[40:28.43]Who the fuck is that?
[40:29.01]Is that a guy?
[40:29.41]Don't come any closer!
[40:31.76]I have a weapon!
[40:36.92]Somebody's shooting a machine gun?
[40:39.46]What the fuck are these people?

[41:38.34]I'm going to die.
[41:39.66]I'm going to die.
[41:40.02]He's hurting.
[41:40.42]They're fighting each other.
[41:41.00]They're fighting each other.
[41:46.69]Die.
[41:51.43]Okay.
[41:52.16]Alright.
[41:53.54]We learned a lot in that first little run.
[41:56.24]We learned a shitload.
[41:59.64]You have to combine stuff to learn new recipes.
[42:03.30]When you've peed too many times and the pee meter fills up the world, it turns into a haunted house.
[42:13.09]So now we know.
[42:16.62]Now we know.
[42:22.96]You have to pee in toilets, bottles, or tents.
[42:25.51]When you pee outdoors, you cause the fog to go up.
[42:28.70]And that's what causes the enemies to spawn.
[42:36.01]Okay.
[42:37.53]So... Uh-oh.
[42:43.69]I think it crashed.
[42:48.40]What the hell is going on with me?
[42:50.22]Is it... Are you okay, dog?
[42:56.84]Okay, every time I reload the save, it resets all of my graphics settings.
[43:06.88]Where is... 1080... Okay, save.
[43:24.22]My goodness, are you alright?
[43:26.32]He's got something like a hair in his throat or something.
[43:31.85]Okay.
[43:36.32]Now save it after saving that, maybe?
[43:41.32]Alright, so here we go.
[43:43.33]Let's just start.
[43:44.23]I gotta kill all these bugs, and then I'm gonna make some shit.
[43:46.77]I... Aren't there a thousand bugs after me?
[43:49.81]Oh, they're all in my bed.
[43:51.24]Great.
[44:07.65]Can I just crush the... No, I can't.
[44:15.76]Why do I even care about this?
[44:17.01]This is not going to be my house.
[44:17.89]I don't care.
[44:21.03]Stat sickness was increased.
[44:23.78]Am I getting sick because of the bugs?
[44:26.44]Causes faster dehydration, reduces strength and perception.
[44:29.79]Can be slowly cured with herbal liquid.
[44:32.85]Oh, great.
[44:36.71]Okay, let's make some stuff here.
[44:39.43]I'm going to eat one of these protein bars.
[44:43.38]How did I make the... It was duct tape and something else, right?
[44:51.79]Where's all my duct tape?
[44:56.62]Didn't I have a bunch of duct tape before?
[45:02.89]Now I got to piss because of this game?
[45:05.20]Floth and wood was the crossbow.
[45:18.53]Okay.
[45:18.65]Alright, there's the crossbow.
[45:25.06]Now I need feathers.
[45:30.34]Okay.
[45:31.76]I can't break down the phones or anything for wire.
[45:35.46]Maybe you could have.
[45:37.34]I have to get feathers.
[45:39.33]I just hurt myself.
[45:40.07]This is fall damage.
[45:43.15]I have to kill one of these animals.
[45:53.26]Hey, you got a Costco membership?
[45:56.74]I actually don't.
[46:01.22]Anytime I drive by a Costco, I get stressed out.
[46:05.02]Because I look over and I just see there's like 5,000 cars in a 4,000 car lot.
[46:11.81]And I go, oh my god, that's a lot of cars in there.
[46:23.94]I've been there before.
[46:24.74]The place is pretty magical.
[46:28.99]But I don't have a membership to it.
[46:32.30]What's the story so far?
[46:35.29]Hold on.
[46:44.78]Is this goo alive?
[46:50.43]Did I just feed him?
[46:57.94]What is this thing?
[47:02.38]Okay, stay on the mission.
[47:03.96]I need feathers.
[47:05.68]I need a bird.
[47:06.36]I need to run up on a bird.
[47:17.53]See any birds?
[47:18.36]Let me know.
[47:28.29]Ow!
[47:32.87]Feather?
[47:33.21]I didn't even drop a feather!
[47:43.52]I got bird meat.
[47:49.67]Oh no, okay.
[47:51.14]Can I extract it from the meat?
[47:53.60]Check the nest?
[47:57.77]Where do you see a bird nest?
[48:05.66]Oh, right here?
[48:13.42]Somebody's shooting at me?
[48:15.65]Ah!
[48:27.84]Oh my God.
[48:28.28]Oh, you're... Are you dead?
[48:38.12]Okay, I gotta make... I gotta... Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[48:41.07]Where are the feathers?
[48:43.79]Did I just eat them?
[48:45.11]No, I didn't want to eat them.
[48:46.28]I wanted to... Oh, that's bad.
[48:48.76]Where's... Give me the gun.
[48:53.25]Where's her gun?
[48:59.87]Where's the gun?
[49:03.88]I don't see it on the ground anywhere.
[49:05.16]Do you see it?
[49:06.40]I see bug meat...
[49:12.48]Where's the gun?
[49:15.49]Is it not here?
[49:17.35]I actually don't see it.
[49:31.08]Fight!
[49:31.42]Fight!
[49:32.04]Fight!
[49:43.14]He's giving me the finger.
[49:44.85]He's giving me the middle finger?
[49:46.33]This thing's terrifying.
[50:13.03]Get the fuck away from me.
[50:15.59]I need to eat.
[50:16.00]I need to eat something right now.
[50:23.23]I just chopped his head off.
[50:51.07]I didn't want two crossbows!
[50:54.77]Okay, wait.
[50:55.23]I have 20 bullets.
[50:56.13]I need a gun.
[51:01.16]Battery.
[51:01.92]Nothing?
[51:08.91]Maybe I can cook the bug meat?
[51:12.43]I- I gotta get- I gotta get the shelter.
[51:15.28]I hate how those things sound.
[51:16.60]Whatever.
[51:16.96]I gotta- I have to go.
[51:18.10]I gotta go.
[51:26.71]I gotta find shelter.
[51:38.63]I got a shitload of bug meat.
[51:39.51]I need a house.
[51:43.92]What the fuck is that thing?
[51:54.09]What the hell are these monsters, dude?
[52:00.28]What the fuck?
[52:02.52]Oh, I hate this.
[52:07.63]I hate this.
[52:17.28]Oh, I hate everything about this.
[52:18.56]Where's the... Is there a house this way?
[52:23.91]Somebody just exploded.
[52:26.57]Something just exploded.
[52:28.70]Something exploded.
[52:35.50]What way should I go to get out of this?
[52:37.75]Follow the road?
[52:38.49]He's right behind me.
[53:08.65]This is, okay, this is... This is fucked up.
[53:23.79]This game is crazy.
[53:25.17]I don't know if I can play this one.
[53:27.01]This one's too scary.
[53:28.55]Can I go in the house and close the door?
[53:32.58]Get in the house, get in the house, get in, get in, get in, get in.
[53:34.60]And please, please, please, please, please, please.
[53:37.27]Oh, fuck.
[53:39.43]Are they stupid?
[53:42.43]Cover the door.
[53:43.13]Cover the door with the bench.
[54:00.77]What is this?
[54:01.09]What does this do?
[54:09.33]I'm sorry.
[54:09.85]I scared the shit out of me.
[54:14.48]I think I'm safe.
[54:24.66]I'm dead.
[54:25.02]I'm dead.
[54:25.40]I'm dead.
[54:25.92]I'm dead.
[54:30.53]This game is terrifying.
[54:31.77]My noise gets fucked up.
[54:33.45]It is what it is.
[54:43.60]Alright.
[54:44.71]So you've really got it.
[54:45.61]You cannot be outside at all.
[54:52.70]Don't ever smoke gas station weed.
[54:56.21]It's true.
[54:58.62]Don't piss out.
[54:59.22]Alright, I will not pee outside again.
[55:00.96]I promise.
[55:12.29]Did the graphic settings save?
[55:15.13]I'm going to stick around near the house.
[55:17.38]I can't believe I ate the feathers.
[55:18.88]That was so dumb.
[55:21.44]Let me see.
[55:22.00]Board up the windows, right?
[55:26.15]A toilet.
[55:29.33]I need a toilet.
[55:31.88]I need... I need something to cover the windows with.
[55:40.91]Custom door.
[55:41.59]Door.
[55:46.77]Custom wall?
[55:48.69]Can I build it here?
[55:54.48]Can I cover this up?
[55:58.14]Maybe I should do ladder.
[56:01.63]Rug.
[56:03.33]Rain collector.
[56:04.77]Resin collector.
[56:10.98]I gotta pick a home base, right?
[56:12.08]Okay.
[56:16.65]Urine purifier?
[56:18.03]Can I drink my own pee?
[56:23.42]I like this game so far.
[56:24.50]It's definitely a game.
[56:27.60]I will say the giant grasshopper was a nice touch.
[56:32.69]That was an awful... Oh, man.
[56:39.24]I think the monster design is great.
[56:44.48]I just have to figure out the kind of tech priority.
[56:49.56]What's the best avenue to get what I need to survive a night?
[57:05.00]You can play something else too.
[57:08.08]I probably will.
[57:08.86]In the next like half hour.
[57:09.70]So I want to give this one more or two more nights.
[57:12.03]Because I do think the game is really funny.
[57:13.21]And I think it was really fun.
[57:14.35]It's just like a crazy game.
[57:15.51]So I want to stick with it for like another night or two.
[57:22.70]Let me try.
[57:25.76]Let me go scavenge.
[57:26.52]I'm not going to pee outside.
[57:27.62]But I need more materials.
[57:31.89]No peeing.
[57:39.29]What if another worm comes?
[57:41.77]Then I'll be scared.
[57:47.04]You should become an urge streamer.
[57:52.98]I feel like I already am an urge streamer.
[57:54.67]Wait.
[57:58.89]I pee like every hour.
[58:00.63]Every hour or two.
[58:01.35]Isn't this the person I was following?
[58:14.54]This was their- the bus thing, right?
[58:17.60]Oh, shit.
[58:20.63]Dude, I am- I live here now.
[58:28.09]That's a map!
[58:31.94]High springs.
[58:32.92]Get to high springs.
[58:36.00]GPS.
[58:36.74]Did I just actually find the- the map?
[58:49.15]How do I access the map?
[58:50.63]Oh my god.
[58:57.94]That's crazy.
[59:01.59]Eat the GPS?
[59:03.91]Well, I am... I know that this is my home base now.
[59:09.18]So with that being said, I'm going to put some spike traps here.
[59:12.06]So I need...
[59:18.65]I need duct tape and wood, so I gotta go- okay, I have to remember where this is.
[59:21.85]Can I- how do I open the GPS?
[59:24.00]Let me look at the controls for a second, key bindings.
[59:28.62]Grouch, hotbar, switch, log, right, okay.
[59:33.19]L is logs.
[59:37.88]Sprint, fire mode, open map is M. Flashlight is X.
[59:46.95]I have a fucking flashlight.
[59:49.93]Does it show where I am on the map?
[60:00.27]Am I that red pin on the top?
[60:03.58]Don't say Q for GPS.
[60:05.06]You just fucking spawned like 10 giant grasshoppers, dude.
[60:07.72]Thanks a lot.
[60:11.49]Alright, I want to go...
[60:16.36]This map is kind of huge.
[60:18.92]I'm going to go this way.
[60:19.65]The top of the map is where all my shit is.
[60:23.47]I'm going to try to survive tonight.
[60:29.96]I need duct tape.
[60:38.31]Try to even make a crossbow.
[60:42.84]I feel like I don't have any room for it.
[60:49.01]I can piss into this bottle.
[60:52.76]I'm gonna piss into the bottle and then throw the bottle away.
[60:54.98]I just drank the piss.
[61:00.69]How do I pee?
[61:01.39]How do I pee?
[61:02.47]How do I pee in it?
[61:07.44]I just pissed in it.
[61:10.14]And I just dumped it on the fucking ground!
[61:22.71]Bone marrow.
[61:32.45]I guess I can just eat these.
[61:33.39]Oh, mealworm.
[61:54.66]Why?
[61:55.84]I just have to pee on the ground!
[61:57.38]Get off me!
[62:16.74]This game is fucked up.
[62:19.10]Okay, if you don't like bugs...
[62:23.19]Oh, I don't know if you're gonna like Urge.
[62:30.92]Okay, there's coffee in that one.
[62:32.10]There's milk in this one.
[62:34.44]How did I put milk in that?
[62:37.07]I'm gonna drop this.
[62:37.91]I'm gonna drop this.
[62:38.87]I don't- I'm dropping this.
[62:41.47]I don't- Fuck it.
[62:42.55]I don't want it.
[62:45.36]You can cook this if I put it on a fire.
[62:47.10]I need inventory space.
[62:51.20]Give me the bone marrow.
[62:56.89]Okay, I need more shit.
[63:01.02]Wait, this can be collected with a plastic bag.
[63:05.08]I hear a bunch of f***ing monsters.
[63:11.47]Oh god.
[63:29.12]I have to get back to the RV.
[63:43.22]I got wire, finally.
[63:50.69]My plan is to go out the fucking back window and I gotta go up.
[64:01.20]Oh, my head hurts.
[64:03.13]My head hurts.
[64:03.65]I got a headache now.
[64:11.99]I think I can kill it.
[64:30.16]That is a giant mosquito.
[64:31.58]How awful.
[64:32.25]Okay, get through that.
[64:33.51]I can't climb through this.
[65:08.53]Okay.
[65:12.66]What can I do?
[65:13.36]What can I even make?
[65:28.74]I'm pissing my pants.
[65:36.59]I am pissing my pants.
[65:46.22]How do I make one of those urine collectors?
[66:13.11]Where do you find the materials for this?
[66:15.98]I haven't found a pipe yet or a metal sheet.
[66:26.64]How do I light the fire?
[66:44.99]Do I have to drop wood on it?
[66:55.56]This is scarier than Silent Hill.
[66:58.48]I feel like it has the potential to be.
[67:00.03]This game is pretty good.
[67:01.03]I'm kind of not very good at it, but I think the concept is really fun.
[67:09.79]Do I need a lighter or something?
[67:12.02]I feel like you need a log to put on there.
[67:16.84]Safe to go out here?
[67:28.69]I'm scared.
[67:35.96]Is the piss a core mechanic?
[67:37.60]It is.
[67:38.87]Uh, the more that you pee, uh, not, I think pee is like a weird zombie toxic thing in this world.
[67:47.85]Okay, I have reached 100% P. So, I hopefully am safe in my little... My little RV.
[68:05.59]It feels like a pretty unforgiving, crazy experience.
[68:09.20]Now, I don't usually play survival games like this.
[68:12.78]So, I'm not really into crafting survival stuff.
[68:16.72]But I would say if you are, this feels pretty fun.
[68:20.27]If you kind of get the gist of it.
[68:24.17]Let's see what happens after tonight.
[68:25.69]You can put the difficulty down.
[68:27.21]That's true.
[68:31.66]What if I, should I open the door?
[68:33.64]Something's clipping through this.
[68:44.61]Is it a pig?
[68:51.08]Oh my god, what is it?
[68:52.41]A pig person?
[68:53.01]It's a pig man.
[69:01.99]Oh, it's the chainsaw guy.
[69:27.08]Come on, get in here!
[69:36.13]Oh, fuck.
[69:48.00]Oh, people are shooting guns.
[69:53.77]What the fuck?
[69:54.55]Was that a Mars Attack Martian?
[70:00.42]Who's shooting me?
[70:01.34]There was an alien outside.
[70:08.83]This game is crazy.
[70:10.15]Oh, he had the gun.
[70:19.76]Oh, okay.
[70:23.53]This game is wild.
[70:24.87]Alright.
[70:26.33]One more attempt.
[70:27.91]I know I'm not playing it correctly, but...
[70:30.61]Let me run around one more night.
[70:33.13]I just want to see all the monster designs.
[70:34.72]They're crazy.
[70:41.05]Apparently, there's a major update coming in one day.
[70:43.31]I don't know what it is, but... Cool.
[70:51.87]Alright, I'm not going to waste any time.
[70:52.97]Let me just... But where do you find...
[70:55.40]The one thing that I haven't really been able to come across is scrap metal.
[71:00.67]Wires and sheet metal.
[71:02.49]I haven't seen it.
[71:03.35]I just have to kind of keep trying to run around.
[71:06.86]I guess the map is gigantic.
[71:08.56]Oh god, I don't have the map.
[71:13.45]I didn't save it.
[71:14.43]Shit.
[71:16.41]Where was the RV?
[71:17.10]It was up here, right?
[71:24.66]Look at how big the map is though.
[71:39.73]It seems like a lot of content in the game.
[71:43.25]But that's where it wants me to go.
[71:47.76]So that's not far.
[71:48.91]That's right here.
[71:49.75]Let me just see what's... Is that where I just was?
[71:51.53]That little house?
[71:53.33]Because that's around this little bend here.
[71:56.64]Let me go see what's there.
[71:58.26]Let me get out of here and just like take... Let me just run for it.
[72:05.95]Because that's like... Is that the house I was just at?
[72:13.26]Because that looks like the bend right there on the top.
[72:26.19]At least I have the safety of the house, which there's a bunch of rooms.
[72:34.24]Yeah, this is the spot, right?
[72:35.60]Or maybe it's a little bit further down.
[72:47.08]Oh, shit.
[72:47.46]This is all the way.
[72:48.46]You know what?
[72:48.84]I think I have to restart the whole game.
[72:51.52]Because I was like laughing and peeing on walls and stuff and I think it actually hard locked my game.
[72:56.15]It made the game like 10 times harder.
[72:57.49]Ooh, duct tape.
[73:05.23]Okay, I at least can build a trap.
[73:20.37]That weird giant worm.
[73:21.80]Okay, I gotta go back.
[73:27.24]I'm gonna hide upstairs.
[73:32.25]You're completely P-locked?
[73:33.71]Yeah.
[73:36.39]So if you get this game, be careful, because you can P-lock yourself.
[73:42.18]I'm going upstairs.
[73:55.90]Do I put it in front of the- This is not going to do anything.
[73:58.34]In fact, it's like a staple.
[74:01.47]Okay, I have one entrance secured.
[74:04.17]Ooh, hold on a second.
[74:09.99]What if I go up top?
[74:29.56]Oh, I'm still crouching.
[74:33.43]Shit, is it not tall enough?
[74:40.54]Fuck.
[74:46.02]I might be safe up here though.
[75:11.02]I was hoping I could get on top of it.
[75:15.87]Alright, this game was fun.
[75:17.23]Let's do something else.
[75:19.07]This is a very good one.
[75:20.05]I think that if you like survival games, you'll probably like this.
[75:23.57]It was crazy, it was scary, and it was fun.
[75:26.32]But let's try another one.
[75:29.24]I got a lot of games that were in the backlog that I really wanted to play.
[75:35.79]Should I play more Mage Arena?
[75:38.47]Um...
[75:40.47]I feel like, yeah, I'd only want to play that with, like, friends.
[75:44.08]Alright.
[75:44.54]Next, I'm going to close it.
[75:46.90]I'm going to go pee.
[75:47.76]I'll be right back.
[75:49.09]And we'll do another game.
[75:51.77]Loud.
[75:53.30]See you in a few minutes.
