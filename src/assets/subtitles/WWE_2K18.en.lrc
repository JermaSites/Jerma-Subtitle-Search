[01:12.93]hey how are you happy no it's not not not yet it's not yet we're getting close we're getting very close I hope everybody's doing good uh I am uh I I'm a little tired right now I'm gonna lie
[01:35.51]I've been kind of like up since yesterday doing this fucking character creation shit.
[01:41.79]I think it was worth it though.
[01:44.83]Bear with me for like another minute or two.
[01:46.35]I'm trying to get like one more thing done.
[01:49.99]And then we'll kill the fucking memes.
[01:52.88]Bear with me for two seconds.
[03:01.28]So if you're wondering what I'm doing, I'm currently... I'm making their entrances.
[03:07.56]And by entrance, I'm picking random entrances.
[03:10.78]Because I ran out of time.
[03:12.17]We have no more time left, so we're gonna have to just... I don't even know who these... Somebody has triple H's.
[03:16.83]I don't even know if that's gonna fit.
[03:19.91]It probably won't, but it'll be funny to watch.
[03:26.69]That's the way I like it.
[03:27.75]Random.
[03:29.03]Totally.
[03:29.67]Some people might even have the same one.
[03:31.25]And I think that's actually funny too.
[03:34.79]Some people might even have, like, completely backwards ones.
[03:38.95]I wish I had a little more time, but, you know.
[03:42.45]You can't cry over spilled shit.
[03:43.95]You know what I'm saying?
[03:46.83]Hold on.
[03:47.65]Only a couple more people need it.
[03:49.79]We can be done, I promise.
[03:51.21]I made so many characters.
[03:53.63]I made 31 characters.
[03:58.93]I drank the poison and made 31 people.
[04:06.09]For some fucked up reason.
[04:12.82]Yeah, I wasn't messing around today.
[04:15.22]Almost done.
[04:16.56]And then we can start it.
[04:17.96]I want to make sure everyone gets... Wait, wait, wait.
[04:19.28]People are going to trickle in here.
[04:20.84]This is an important holiday event.
[04:22.34]You know what I'm saying?
[04:28.29]This isn't just a regular stream.
[04:30.87]We're starting at 11 o'clock, first of all.
[04:35.54]Copy this to... Who else needs it?
[04:37.38]I'm not going to say their names, because that would give it away.
[04:43.76]And I don't want to give some of these away, because some of these are my favorite characters I've ever made.
[04:49.49]At least in the 2K17+.
[04:53.82]I don't want to tell you who this is.
[04:56.34]We'll talk about it afterwards, but you'll see what I'm talking about.
[05:00.18]Okay, are we good there?
[05:04.13]Who else needs one?
[05:04.93]You do.
[05:06.81]And you do!
[05:12.47]Wait, one more.
[05:14.22]Incoming made-up memes.
[05:15.90]I didn't have time to do that.
[05:19.01]You understand?
[05:19.65]I didn't even- I didn't have an ounce of time to spare.
[05:23.15]I wish I did.
[05:25.83]All I could put in was like a bunch of these dumb stupid fucking jokes and memes and... You'll see.
[05:33.12]Nobody said that.
[05:34.02]Is that gonna be like a 2018 thing now?
[05:37.97]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[05:43.10]Every time.
[05:44.28]Every fucking time I see it, man, I laugh.
[05:47.12]It's like, it's so fucked up.
[05:48.80]Like, I can't wait for you guys to see this shit.
[05:52.94]Alright, we're ready to go.
[05:54.82]If somebody doesn't have one, then that's just too fucking bad.
[05:57.26]I'm ready to go.
[06:00.66]Welcome, everybody.
[06:03.40]I am now officially ready to start the stream.
[06:07.02]So.
[06:09.30]We're gonna go over some ground rules.
[06:10.90]I need, like, a graphic.
[06:14.95]Hold on.
[06:15.17]Let me just get, like, a graphic for you.
[06:18.30]I'm gonna milk the shit out of this, because this stream's only gonna be, like, an hour and 40 minutes long.
[06:21.62]Not even.
[06:21.92]Uh, rules.
[06:26.72]Let me go over some rules.
[06:27.92]I can just do a black screen.
[06:29.92]Who cares?
[06:30.40]Uh, that's fine.
[06:37.95]I have so many windows open.
[06:41.13]Alright, so.
[06:42.75]How this is gonna work...
[06:45.08]If you're the first, this is like one of the first streams I've ever been to.
[06:47.58]I don't know why it would be if you're like here at 11 o'clock.
[06:50.31]But so, this is the kill the memes stream.
[06:54.43]And what that is, is over the last year or two, since I've been streaming full time, a lot of people have come up with some really hilarious things.
[07:05.40]In the chat, me in particular too, like these, I've made up some of these things too.
[07:09.34]You know, I've made up some jokes.
[07:11.99]And we're going to let them fight each other.
[07:14.10]There is in total, I believe, 30 or 31 jokes that are all different characters.
[07:19.80]And I don't want this shit to trickle into 2018.
[07:22.32]You understand?
[07:24.66]This is old school.
[07:25.86]This is old memes, old jokes.
[07:27.99]I hate saying that word, memes.
[07:29.21]I hate the word meme.
[07:31.85]Does anybody else hate saying that word?
[07:35.11]I think I might be the only one.
[07:36.65]But anyways.
[07:36.97]Anyways.
[07:38.37]There are a lot of random jokes.
[07:44.97]Almost all of the things you're seeing tonight are going to go away.
[07:49.33]All of your favorite jokes, all your favorite little quips and side phrases, all your little phrases, they're all going to be deleted.
[07:57.08]And if you use any of the jokes that don't make it tonight, you're going to get timed out.
[08:03.90]2018, new year, new jokes.
[08:05.70]Can't latch on to the old stuff, you know what I'm saying?
[08:10.72]So with that being said, crack open your favorite drink because we got about 50 minutes.
[08:19.98]We have 50 minutes until the big show.
[08:23.99]Obviously, of course, there's going to be some preliminary stuff.
[08:28.15]So let's go ahead and get right to it.
[08:29.91]Take that off the screen and let's start the fucking show.
[08:35.87]Watch it like not even work.
[08:39.72]Oh, no.
[08:41.54]It's like not loading.
[08:43.56]I'm kidding.
[08:44.18]It's fine.
[08:47.02]Some of these I'm going to be sad when they're gone.
[08:48.40]I'm going to be really sad.
[08:53.08]Alright.
[08:58.18]We're doing two rumbles, by the way.
[09:00.00]There are two chances for a meme to survive.
[09:05.27]You heard it right.
[09:05.73]There are two.
[09:07.87]One is kind of an encore, but the main one's the first one.
[09:11.93]So, shall we get started?
[09:17.01]I think we shall.
[09:19.77]And here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:25.43]Welcome to the Kill the Meme stream.
[09:29.07]2017 was quite a year.
[09:31.48]Dean Ambrose punched a guy.
[09:34.48]Somebody wore sunglasses.
[09:36.36]There was an explosion.
[09:38.58]Remember when Jerma fell through that table?
[09:40.16]Well, that was like two years ago.
[09:41.40]Forget about what I just said.
[09:42.62]That guy like did a butt bomb on somebody.
[09:49.15]I have to get out of this.
[09:50.13]I have to get out of this.
[09:51.81]Nope, here it is.
[09:54.81]This usually does this and it shows you like a spoiler.
[09:57.13]I'm going to be ready for it.
[10:00.05]The first match is going to be a good one.
[10:04.66]I'm so scared of this first match because I don't know if it's going to go to the spoiler screen.
[10:08.60]It doesn't every time.
[10:09.36]What am I talking about?
[10:10.02]Oh shit!
[10:13.77]Wait, wait, wait!
[10:15.67]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10:16.43]I forgot to turn off the commentary.
[10:20.33]Oh shit.
[10:24.19]God damn it.
[10:27.91]Wait, where are the options?
[10:32.81]Oh, god damn it.
[10:33.97]I can get to the options, right?
[10:37.13]Fucking forgot to turn off the stupid commentary.
[10:40.67]I think I can do it in the options.
[10:41.73]Can I?
[10:42.19]I can do it.
[10:44.48]Alright, here we go.
[10:48.40]Fuck.
[10:50.22]Should I go?
[10:51.70]Damn it!
[10:53.24]The one thing!
[10:54.32]The one thing I didn't do!
[10:58.32]Alright, somebody look it up.
[11:00.09]Look it up right now.
[11:02.49]Can you turn off the commentary in mid-match?
[11:07.17]Somebody look it up quick.
[11:10.81]Or do I have to go back?
[11:17.77]Fucking hell.
[11:22.49]You can't.
[11:26.81]Wait, I think we're okay.
[11:27.67]I think we're going to be okay.
[11:32.24]Hey, happy fucking new year, everybody.
[11:34.28]Alright, we're good.
[11:39.60]I think I soiled it.
[11:40.86]No, I think I saved it.
[11:42.42]Audio volume, here we go.
[11:45.95]Thank you.
[11:47.69]Thank you, voice.
[11:49.15]Thank you.
[11:49.69]I think we're good, right?
[11:53.45]Does voice count as commentary?
[11:59.72]It has to, right?
[12:01.38]It has to.
[12:04.32]Okay.
[12:04.50]Let me double check that shit.
[12:09.97]I don't want like Bobby the Brain Heenan talking during my universe.
[12:13.37]Alright, continue.
[12:15.05]Here we go.
[12:16.07]Please God, don't tell me that I have to do that.
[12:18.51]Don't tell me.
[12:19.13]Don't even tell me.
[12:20.97]Don't even tell me that because like Bobby the Brain Heenan, thank God it's still here.
[12:28.33]Okay, hey.
[12:31.89]Ladies and gentlemen, pardon that interruption.
[12:34.08]Let's go ahead and start the show.
[12:42.06]Oh, I turned off the music.
[12:45.42]Alright, just like pretend you saw the first part, and then we're going to go to this part now.
[12:55.73]This one is after.
[12:57.11]Just cut this one together.
[12:59.27]Alright, yeah, just forget it.
[13:00.01]It's going to be fine.
[13:03.35]Okay.
[13:03.47]Alright.
[13:06.59]So, let's go ahead and get to the first match.
[13:09.05]Oh, there's an explosion.
[13:10.59]You guys can't hear it.
[13:11.27]I know you can't because... Now you can.
[13:15.38]See, now the audio's back.
[13:18.30]Should we start over?
[13:19.32]3, 2, 1.
[13:20.78]Ladies and gentlemen, you hear that electric crowd.
[13:22.63]Here to kill the memes.
[13:25.51]2017 was quite a year, of course.
[13:26.91]We're repeating ourselves.
[13:28.35]But look at all these.
[13:29.01]We're in Reno, Nevada right now.
[13:31.15]In the heart of Las Vegas.
[13:33.05]That's right.
[13:33.41]We're going to have some gambling shoes on tonight.
[13:36.03]Let's not show the spoiler.
[13:41.92]Okay.
[13:42.44]Here we go.
[13:45.50]The first match is going to be
[13:49.81]Heading back to Reno, yeah.
[13:50.75]Alright, here we go.
[13:52.57]One, two, three, start it.
[13:59.51]And is it going to load?
[14:00.61]Yeah, I don't want to show you the screen because this is a spoiler.
[14:05.44]We don't do spoilers here.
[14:11.09]Come on, give me a little bit of slack.
[14:13.81]I started this two days ago.
[14:15.65]I made 31 characters in two days.
[14:18.99]I had to get this whole, it's New Year's Eve.
[14:20.86]I didn't even call my mother yet.
[14:25.04]In fact, my mother doesn't even know if I'm alive.
[14:28.66]I haven't talked to her in like six weeks.
[14:36.74]Alright, let's fucking go.
[14:37.96]Come on, load it.
[14:39.70]We always have to sit here and wait for it to load.
[14:47.52]So the first match, by the way, if you're curious, is going to be a tag team table match.
[14:52.16]Gotta start it off right.
[14:55.16]Two teams.
[14:56.27]Two very important.
[14:58.01]Two very important teams.
[15:01.67]This copyrighted music is just blasting in my ears.
[15:05.95]Here we go.
[15:08.72]It's time to begin.
[15:10.06]Ladies and gentlemen, the first match of the evening is going to be between one of the most overused jokes on the entire stream on the last year.
[15:27.38]But we're not going to talk about that team first.
[15:29.52]We're going to talk about the first team.
[15:30.42]The first team is going to be the most overused things I've been requested to play.
[15:35.68]On that team is going to be, of course, JermaCraft.
[15:38.58]He was coming in here at, I think, 185 pounds.
[15:40.18]Jerma Craft is... Nobody ever stops talking about this.
[15:44.76]This is one of those memes that just will never die.
[15:48.73]But tonight it will, potentially.
[15:51.07]His teammate, of course, if you're wondering, is none other than... Any second now he'll come out.
[16:04.69]Listen to that crowd screaming.
[16:06.59]What's the second most requested thing I'm told to play?
[16:11.39]By the way, they just snap into a Snickers, baby.
[16:13.39]I don't know whose titantron this is, but this is not the right guy.
[16:19.94]Hey, the character is... Spore!
[16:25.43]That's right, the second most asked, requested...
[16:32.15]I didn't... Yeah, get your JervaCraft memes out here now.
[16:37.32]And this is as shitty as a Spore character as I can make.
[16:39.98]WWE 2K18 is awful.
[16:42.06]Like, let me first, like, just make that... Do not recommend.
[16:45.40]Somebody... Why did that person just scream?
[16:48.06]So Team 1 is the most over... This guy keeps cutting me off.
[16:52.63]Team 1 most overused video game request.
[16:56.77]So... The most overused game request versus the most overused joke.
[17:02.50]If you could guess what that would be.
[17:05.40]I'll give you a hint.
[17:07.62]It's a couple of numbers.
[17:11.84]They're going to make their way... By the way, this is a tornado tag table match.
[17:17.63]Whoever wins this... It don't fucking matter.
[17:20.55]They're all going to die anyways.
[17:22.45]This is just to get us... Get our blood pumping a little bit.
[17:29.19]Really, really taking their time to come out this evening.
[17:35.16]What's it going to be?
[17:36.28]JermaCraft and Spore taking on... That's right!
[17:43.21]It's +2 and -2!
[17:46.35]Comedy and tragedy, they both share an equal place in my heart.
[17:51.59]Well, not the tragedy part, but... You get the first half of this is +2 here.
[17:58.42]Make sure you buy this because it makes it go to KFC as well.
[18:04.13]I love just having the crowd music on.
[18:07.79]It's so perfect, because all you can hear is just this one guy, just like standing back there going, Yeah!
[18:17.06]So the partner coming out, you know, like, should I press X?
[18:20.34]No, it took fucking so long making all these dumb people.
[18:26.60]His partner is -2.
[18:28.96]You can't have one without the other.
[18:32.49]No, it's not 2018 without making a new meme.
[18:34.39]There's no new memes yet, guys.
[18:35.57]It's not 2018 yet.
[18:39.84]Waiting for him.
[18:40.34]He's a little slow.
[18:42.46]He's got that melancholy.
[18:43.52]There he is.
[18:43.98]Tragedy.
[18:44.42]-2.
[18:47.28]By the way, if you want to follow this guy on Twitter, at -2, apparently.
[18:52.02]What is that?
[18:54.64]Never give up.
[18:56.34]Well, that's certainly not a thing that a -2 would ever say.
[19:05.00]Well, maybe he's talking about jokes.
[19:06.50]Never give up on trying to make friendly jokes.
[19:13.66]Again, let me reiterate something really quickly.
[19:16.46]I ran out of time, so all these people have random entrances.
[19:19.99]I don't know what any of them are.
[19:22.81]That's John, the most positive guy in the WWE on the most negative character I think I may have made.
[19:29.13]So let's go.
[19:32.30]Happy almost new year TornadoTag Most requested video games for me to play Versus most overused jokes Let's get started Tables, I don't know what it means If you break through the tables, I think you lose Oh yeah, his name is Cena, alright Gerbacraft getting loose Trying to undo some of those blocks
[20:01.14]Sold out audience here of 3,000 people.
[20:04.72]And in any real sport, that would be a total travesty.
[20:07.80]Here we go!
[20:08.26]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Kill the Meme Stream!
[20:11.29]As we get started for the first time, a snap suplex by Spore onto +2.
[20:15.37]Remember, they're both in the ring at the same time.
[20:18.15]There are no tagging in this one.
[20:20.51]And we have kicks and punches here.
[20:23.11]-2.
[20:23.51]It's gonna be hard to keep track.
[20:25.27]And -2 going to the top ropes already.
[20:27.91]That going to the standing knee splash onto Dermacraft.
[20:31.09]Well, Spore is the tallest person you can make.
[20:33.53]This is why WWE 2K18 sucks, we'll talk about this really quickly.
[20:40.81]That's like the weirdest person you can make.
[20:43.93]Everybody has to be like a human in this game, and it's really annoying.
[20:47.15]Look at Spore trying to rile the crowd up, trying to get them to tell me to play Spore!
[20:50.28]I'm gonna have to change games here in a second!
[20:51.92]Oh, and he just barely got away from that one.
[20:55.52]What's with the middle rope?
[20:57.56]Nice reversal there by -2.
[20:59.72]Didn't like that.
[21:00.36]Didn't think that was very funny by Jermicraft.
[21:02.44]Scoop Slam!
[21:03.08]And they're just trying to do both at the same time.
[21:04.70]No, it's reverse Snapmare!
[21:06.64]Unbelievably beautiful work there by +2.
[21:09.81]Now going to the... Yeah, that's a +2 right there.
[21:13.11]Take that to the bank and fucking smoke that joke.
[21:15.41]That's what he says to the audience.
[21:17.03]Now they have an opportunity here to double team on... Wait a minute.
[21:21.05]No, there's no pins.
[21:21.81]You have to go through a table.
[21:23.89]Jermacraft is currently... Spore is very slow to get up right now.
[21:29.77]Which makes sense.
[21:30.35]I mean, the game did come out in like 2005.
[21:32.81]So... Ooh!
[21:33.81]Just missed that elbow drop there.
[21:35.09]And -2 is getting the table now.
[21:38.42]Table is now inside the ring.
[21:39.94]This could end very, very quickly.
[21:41.32]This could end faster than if we even started.
[21:44.86]Spore now.
[21:45.48]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[21:46.46]-2.
[21:47.12]Trying to roll away.
[21:48.98]This... -2 brings it in, but... Oh, he's got the table smashing right on +2.
[21:54.88]He knows how to use wood.
[21:56.06]He's used it before.
[21:56.78]He's played Minecraft once or twice for a total of like eight hours total.
[22:03.16]Setting that table up into the corner is Spore, and he's trying to get everybody to tell him to play JermaCraft.
[22:07.74]No, right when he's not looking!
[22:15.53]And he just, Spore just walked into a door there for a second.
[22:19.51]Accidentally.
[22:21.01]Just kind of bumped his head.
[22:23.23]Didn't break the table.
[22:24.44]I don't think he weighs enough.
[22:25.50]He is a weird monster for all.
[22:27.38]For all we know.
[22:28.70]He could be a person.
[22:29.78]He could be an alien.
[22:31.34]Big backdrop there by +2.
[22:38.11]I see +2 is clearly doing the I'm the Undertaker.
[22:41.79]Hey, I'm the Undertaker.
[22:46.33]Wait, no, he's got him into the table.
[22:47.97]This could be bad.
[22:50.42]No, no, you got to use the table.
[22:52.08]Why is nobody using the table?
[22:54.19]Set it up and Powerbomb somebody through it.
[22:57.41]Looks like we're going to see, maybe we're going to see it used here as a weapon.
[23:06.50]No, he accidentally just hit his friend.
[23:09.62]-2 hitting, +2 accidently, then throws the table.
[23:13.12]Overboard.
[23:14.78]And does not want to use the table anymore.
[23:18.10]He was not happy with the joke.
[23:19.98]I believe +2 said something funny about JermaCraft and -2 did not think it was funny and was trying to punish him for that.
[23:26.12]And they're staying even, both at zero now.
[23:30.59]Friendly fire.
[23:31.83]We're going backstage!
[23:33.89]JermaCraft and +2 are going backstage.
[23:35.43]No!
[23:36.23]Opportunity, bring it in the ring!
[23:38.11]This is an opportunity to get it in the ring!
[23:41.28]-2 could be in a lot of trouble.
[23:44.32]No, Jermocraft is going to leave the ring.
[23:47.24]This is what I like to see here.
[23:48.38]Set that table up.
[23:49.32]Put him through it and end this match.
[23:51.82]Big left hand out backstage by Jermocraft.
[23:57.73]That's -2 now.
[23:58.73]Got him in the air.
[23:59.25]This could be the end.
[23:59.77]No, it's a reversal.
[24:02.39]That was a nice reversal.
[24:05.89]I love how they keep setting the table up.
[24:07.85]And then, now he's gonna throw it over the ring.
[24:10.11]No, he's setting it up, trying to do a corner move.
[24:15.19]Oh!
[24:15.73]Nope, not heavy enough.
[24:18.65]Oh boy, this could be the end right here!
[24:20.28]Powerbomb!
[24:21.48]Directly into the table!
[24:23.12]That's it!
[24:25.76]Absolutely devastates him!
[24:28.20]Powerbomb into the corner!
[24:30.72]Nearly kills him!
[24:33.20]Nearly fucking kills him!
[24:35.45]As you see, a couple of chops here.
[24:39.82]Great highlights by this game's AI engine.
[24:44.38]And how did it end?
[24:45.60]Let's take a look here.
[24:46.68]Look at our instant kill the meme replay.
[24:49.60]-2 takes a huge pajama slam right into the... It explodes the table.
[24:55.90]And as you can see, JermaCraft was really busy taking on +2 there.
[25:01.75]And there's your winners there.
[25:02.55]The -2 and +2 have been...
[25:05.60]eliminated from the match here.
[25:08.04]Not the game, because they are still in the Rumble.
[25:11.56]So don't worry about that.
[25:13.68]Don't you worry about that.
[25:14.56]Everyone's going to get a chance.
[25:17.41]As long as we don't spoil this.
[25:19.33]Alright, here we go.
[25:23.89]On to the next match.
[25:27.85]You guys are going to like this one.
[25:31.81]I think you guys are gonna like this one.
[25:33.81]Because, like every single time I do one of these, there has to be, there just has to be, six huge fucking people fighting each other, right?
[25:46.78]Except this one has actual stakes.
[25:49.76]You see, once it's loading here, we'll talk about the stakes.
[25:55.30]I have a certain amount of emotes, right?
[26:01.18]And you guys know what those emotes are.
[26:02.34]Those emotes are the solar system.
[26:06.50]Now, some of them don't get used.
[26:10.88]Some get used more than others, and they've been working overtime for at least the last year.
[26:16.40]I've had some of these emotes for a long time, and what we told them, we got all the planets into a room, and we said, hey, listen, if you guys want to do a gigantic six-planet rumble,
[26:31.54]I really hope whoever wins is going to get so much money and so much praise.
[26:38.20]And that's exactly what we're doing.
[26:39.30]Except when they left the room, we actually talked about the real plan.
[26:43.45]And that is whoever wins this match is deleted as an emote.
[26:49.17]Because there's too many planets and some of them are dumb.
[26:53.01]So they're all going to be fighting for their lives.
[26:54.31]We said they were going to get $50,000 for about 15 minutes of time.
[26:58.98]So whoever wins this match is getting deleted.
[27:05.96]So good luck.
[27:11.20]Kill the memes, guys.
[27:12.86]That's the way it works.
[27:15.45]We kill the memes.
[27:19.11]Welcome back.
[27:20.67]Let's introduce our six emotes.
[27:27.31]There is Jerma's son there.
[27:30.17]And don't worry, they're not all going to be serpents.
[27:32.93]Jerma's son is the first to come down.
[27:35.05]This is a ladder match, by the way.
[27:37.51]They're all fighting for their lives.
[27:38.73]They're going to climb up that ladder, grab the briefcase.
[27:42.23]We told them there was $50,000 in the briefcase.
[27:44.21]You know how much that is to a planet?
[27:47.87]That's like a seven-year salary.
[27:50.27]But what's actually in there is you're fired.
[27:53.60]See you later.
[27:56.56]Don't worry, but they're not all going to be serpents.
[28:09.16]So you got to get your stakes.
[28:11.70]Where do you want to stay?
[28:13.75]No one is safe in the Kill the Meme stream, guys.
[28:18.45]Why does he have a tail?
[28:19.39]Because that's the... I don't know.
[28:22.61]That's the supernova that's going to happen.
[28:27.32]Coming in next.
[28:27.76]We got all the planets.
[28:28.86]All of them.
[28:30.94]Lights are off.
[28:32.26]Who could this one be?
[28:33.28]The sun is getting a little nervous.
[28:36.42]There's Saturn.
[28:38.06]Saturn making his first ever debut.
[28:40.62]All of them are, actually.
[28:42.24]As you can see, the rings of Saturn are very, very clearly defined.
[28:49.46]Tiny supernova, yeah.
[28:53.00]Looking as majestic and elegant as you could possibly look.
[29:01.41]You need to say... One of them's gone!
[29:04.77]Saturn, best planet.
[29:06.03]Look, just because they're getting deleted doesn't mean they can't come back like a long time from now.
[29:11.75]We're gonna do a pool cue.
[29:12.80]We're gonna knock them with a pool cue out of the orbit.
[29:15.68]They always come back.
[29:17.56]Eventually.
[29:20.60]But there is Saturn.
[29:21.60]Saturn just kind of looks like a baby.
[29:22.86]He looks like a Gerber baby.
[29:27.54]You guys already know who the other competitors are.
[29:32.13]Two to three years they'll be back.
[29:34.67]He took off his rings.
[29:36.23]You know, when you fight, you gotta take your rings off.
[29:38.41]I agree.
[29:39.92]I got at least three or four of them.
[29:41.18]When I'm fighting, I always take them off.
[29:44.56]Next up coming in is... There's the moon, of course.
[29:48.84]Turn of the moon.
[29:51.82]And yes, this is like another serpent.
[29:53.81]It's alright.
[29:54.43]Look, this is not the main event.
[29:57.21]This is the shit emote battle.
[29:59.73]To delete one of these fucking stupid planets.
[30:06.22]Please don't kill him off.
[30:07.76]Please don't win.
[30:09.14]They're all fighting for their lives.
[30:11.44]They think there's money in there.
[30:16.74]Go for it.
[30:23.69]See, what I want to know is... Obviously the moon's been around the longest.
[30:28.51]The newest planet is Saturn, right?
[30:31.57]Oh no, the newest planet is actually... The newest planet is Mars.
[30:36.49]so could the newcomer be deleted that's a sad thought or one of the old the the Earth the moon the moon is the first emote I ever had how sad would that be if he were to be deleted he would be sent to another solar system looking he's just going to go visit another solar system and here you can see the green for the green planet that's right it's got all kinds of green gas
[31:07.34]and staying really hydrated look at those vapors this planet is you can't stand on this planet for more than five seconds that's Mars the green planet he's spraying out his the Mars is so hot you can't even stand on the surface he just sprayed out that steam newest planet
[31:43.29]Green, the Mars, the green planet.
[31:49.89]Oh, look, no, I thought he was gonna go punch somebody in the audience.
[31:54.42]What he's gonna do, he's gonna show us one of his tricks, his little steam tricks.
[32:00.18]You don't stand on that planet for a second.
[32:08.08]Mars is 645 degrees, as you'll be able to see here in four or five seconds.
[32:13.53]One, two, three, four.
[32:18.29]That was an animal that was in his mouth.
[32:19.61]Just disintegrated into two.
[32:22.58]Disintegrated.
[32:24.48]See, my throat even is bothering me.
[32:26.92]He blew that right in my face and it was like 400 degrees.
[32:35.87]God, Jesus.
[32:48.43]this boss from Naxxramas.
[32:54.71]Why are these intros so long?
[32:56.59]Because this game is terrible.
[32:58.20]That's why.
[33:01.28]God, get your -2 out there.
[33:02.78]I hope he wins.
[33:03.76]I hope -2 wins the rumble because we'll talk about that in a minute.
[33:08.46]Alright, let's go.
[33:09.30]Let's go.
[33:09.72]Come on.
[33:11.55]Let's go, you like blood-borne enemy.
[33:15.85]I don't want to... I'm scared to press X.
[33:24.57]Oh my God, will you fucking hurry up?
[33:27.20]Jeez.
[33:29.88]We know, we've seen Mars.
[33:32.72]They all have tails.
[33:33.64]Well, they all have moons.
[33:34.58]And there he is.
[33:35.18]Everyone's favorite is on the way out right now.
[33:38.73]Judging by the jacket, you can see that sometimes it's a little bit of trouble to make a complete Jupiter.
[33:44.57]Sometimes it's broken.
[33:45.45]Sometimes it's torn up.
[33:47.85]But he is ready to be on Space Mountain right now.
[33:54.01]Jerma Jupiter.
[33:55.81]The fan favorite, I would say.
[33:58.97]Hopefully you don't win.
[34:02.87]See?
[34:03.31]Even that guy.
[34:03.71]That guy screamed too.
[34:04.31]Yeah, and that guy also is in the chat because he's also saying, like, skip the intros.
[34:09.77]Let's do this.
[34:15.48]What was that?
[34:17.08]I don't know who's in.
[34:17.78]I don't know whose entrance he has, but that was elegant.
[34:25.44]Don't worry.
[34:25.74]There's only two more.
[34:29.08]That was me.
[34:32.42]Don't worry.
[34:32.76]There's only two more, like, 65-second intros.
[34:34.95]Don't worry, guys.
[34:42.13]Earth is one of them.
[34:42.79]Earth is probably coming up next.
[34:44.75]And yes, it is.
[34:45.52]There it is.
[34:45.98]The planet Earth.
[34:48.02]jermaEarth.
[34:49.50]This is actually the last person I made because I was rushing as fast as I could to make him.
[34:55.61]So, I tried.
[34:56.81]It came out a little gaudy, but it's alright.
[35:09.45]Flat Earth.
[35:11.29]No, that's not true.
[35:13.09]The Earth is not flat.
[35:14.73]The globe is round.
[35:16.01]The Earth is flat.
[35:18.13]Didn't you guys learn that in middle school?
[35:24.76]Alright, last one.
[35:30.40]Human-shaped Earth.
[35:33.74]Go, go, go, go, go!
[35:35.04]Here we go, here we go, here we go!
[35:36.20]Here it is!
[35:36.72]Spill stream.
[35:37.30]That wasn't a spill.
[35:42.38]Alright, here comes the last one.
[35:45.99]OH SHIT!
[35:47.55]What happened?
[35:49.80]Wait, no, that was the last one.
[35:51.77]Oh, that was, okay.
[35:52.79]I don't even know my own emotes.
[35:58.89]I don't even know my own emotes.
[36:01.35]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the six-man ladder match.
[36:05.29]All the emotes, remember, Earth is currently kicking and nobody... Durvimar is lying on the ground, getting missed.
[36:12.49]No, he finally connects with that right kick!
[36:14.96]And a right-handed punch, well...
[36:19.11]Saturn just accidentally frog-splashed Earth.
[36:22.95]I can't even pay attention to what's going on.
[36:24.53]Jerma Jupiter is sitting in the middle of the ring stunned and dazed for some reason.
[36:31.36]Now, jermaEarth, remember, whoever climbs to the top of the ladder and grabs the briefcase full of pretend money is the emote that is getting deleted.
[36:43.90]Rumble's gonna be int- there are no intros in the Rumble.
[36:48.20]There are no pins here.
[36:49.96]There are no executions.
[36:53.03]It's just who can grab the money.
[36:56.11]Nice spinning neckbreaker onto Jerma-Earth by Saturn.
[36:59.89]Well, the sun is stomping now.
[37:01.67]Jerma-Jupiter has done nothing.
[37:03.33]No!
[37:03.93]That's where he wakes up!
[37:05.71]Slamming the moon directly into that steel bar.
[37:10.31]Lot more real estate it seems this year.
[37:13.34]You never used to be able to go all the way out here.
[37:14.82]There was an electric fence that used to keep all these animals in place.
[37:21.38]And Jerma Jupiter is the smartest planet.
[37:24.11]Remember, the larger you are, the bigger your brain is.
[37:27.69]So Jerma Jupiter has a huge brain.
[37:30.51]It might be broken up into four quadrants, but it's still the biggest.
[37:35.01]But jermaMars now is...
[37:37.13]Going for it.
[37:37.83]Ooh, what a reversal there by Saturn.
[37:39.65]Saturn has the moves.
[37:40.77]I think Saturn... Saturn has a ton of agility right now.
[37:44.43]He wants it so bad.
[37:45.85]Because, according to a poll that I did a few weeks ago, Saturn is by far my worst emote.
[37:52.06]So, I would love it if it was possible we could get rid of the arguably the worst emote.
[37:59.36]And the second worst emote was Jerma... Mars.
[38:03.64]So, that's really interesting.
[38:04.82]We got Mars.
[38:05.42]The two newest ones are the worst ones.
[38:13.37]All backstage brawl here.
[38:14.77]All in the apron.
[38:15.49]Nobody going back in the ring.
[38:16.69]Now Saturn... Saturn wants that money.
[38:20.12]He can taste it.
[38:21.66]He can taste it with his actual physical mouth, not his metaphorical one.
[38:25.98]Nice punches.
[38:27.82]Got him by the neck.
[38:28.52]He's gonna do a backwards suplex?
[38:30.39]No, it's a backwards back driver.
[38:34.07]Wrestling vocabulary, folks.
[38:37.35]He's taunting.
[38:38.49]He wants it bad.
[38:40.72]In fact, he might just go get it right now.
[38:42.28]No, the ladder's not even in the ring.
[38:43.58]Now, he is going for it, but jermaMars is going to stop him.
[38:45.42]jermaMars is going to throw him into the ropes.
[38:48.64]And walk into him and kick and punch him a few times.
[38:51.68]And now he's in the corner, going up to the top turnbuckle.
[38:55.58]Ooh, it got reversed, and it could be for his downfall.
[38:59.14]Hurricane Rana onto a different person.
[39:03.14]He must have smelled him from, you know, those rings.
[39:05.45]He has those rings.
[39:06.55]Remember, even though he doesn't have them on anymore.
[39:10.08]He still has the sense, he has the spider sense in about a 200-foot radius around him.
[39:15.72]And while jermaSun now going for maybe a huge hurricanrana off the top turnbuckle to jermaMoon.
[39:23.15]And for the first time since the match started, it seems like jermaMars is grabbing the ladder.
[39:32.60]Then grabs it and hits him in the face.
[39:35.28]He says, thank you very much.
[39:36.98]And Jirba Moon might clear the ring and get the money.
[39:40.85]Not going to put it down.
[39:41.67]Gets dropkicked for his trouble.
[39:44.15]And he's going to get a fireman's carry.
[39:46.07]No, he's going to get thrown into the... That was very lazy.
[39:51.57]But also effective at the same time.
[39:54.41]As Saturn... Saturn seems to be the only one that's trying to get people out of the ring.
[40:00.90]And this could be it.
[40:03.18]This actually... No, no, he wants to break up the... JermaJupiter and Sun fight there.
[40:11.02]JermaJupiter has been so useless.
[40:14.19]Are you guys as surprised about this as I am?
[40:17.19]JermaJupiter is... I would say... No, no, he's being held.
[40:21.63]What the fuck was that?
[40:24.39]He just shoved his knees into his mouth.
[40:27.95]Maybe it's just about being... Oh, there we go!
[40:30.78]He was just conserving his energy.
[40:33.20]Yeah, I think he might have popped out his shoulder.
[40:35.44]His shoulder is bothering him.
[40:37.58]And that's going to be enough, I think, to get him out of the ring.
[40:40.20]No, almost fell through the ropes there as jermaMars sets up.
[40:42.61]And now we've got our first potential.
[40:44.85]jermaMars is making his way up to the money.
[40:48.11]Is jermaMars going to get deleted?
[40:50.49]Oh, big elbow drop.
[40:51.97]JermaJupiter, oh, he's going to grab it.
[40:53.65]JermaJupiter might be able to grab this.
[40:55.25]Unless jermaMoon starts something here.
[40:58.14]No, he throws him off.
[40:59.90]Jerma Jupiter.
[41:02.28]Jerma Jupiter is going to get the money.
[41:04.54]No.
[41:07.55]Jerma Jupiter has got it.
[41:09.69]jermaMoon is just watching.
[41:13.49]No, he didn't get it.
[41:15.17]jermaMoon stops it.
[41:16.95]jermaMoon stops it and does a suplex off the table.
[41:25.47]Jeremy Moon does a gigantic suplex, and now Jeremy Moon is going for that briefcase.
[41:31.48]Well, Jeremy Saturn's the only one that seems to be alert and awake to be able to stop him.
[41:34.78]No, stops him, grabs one.
[41:36.56]He's got one hand on that briefcase.
[41:38.46]He thinks there's $50,000 in it, but dude, you're going to get deleted.
[41:41.78]Three punches now.
[41:42.72]It's not enough to stop the moon.
[41:44.10]Saturn's not as big as the moon.
[41:45.64]He can, oh, and it's, he did stop it.
[41:48.44]He's just, he's slowly coming back down.
[41:50.22]No, he's off.
[41:51.53]No, Jerma Jupiter again is in the ring.
[41:53.65]Saturn, Jerma Jupiter, jermaMoon.
[41:56.23]Oh, and the ladder gets knocked over.
[41:59.47]Oh, jermaEarth and jermaSun are outside doing their own shit.
[42:04.63]I don't think they really care.
[42:05.57]You know, it makes sense.
[42:07.33]You know, jermaEarth cares more about, like, the people.
[42:09.79]You know, he's like planet Earth.
[42:12.15]He cares more about sustaining the humans.
[42:14.52]He doesn't care about money.
[42:15.42]He doesn't care... He wants to make sure he gives the resources.
[42:18.72]Not the other way around.
[42:20.34]While the Moon is being very greedy, Saturn now and the Moon both up at the same time.
[42:23.95]Saturn now is going to do... It looks like a suplex.
[42:27.55]Do we...
[42:32.73]jermaMoon has an opportunity here.
[42:36.07]jermaMoon is going to get the money.
[42:37.69]No, the sun.
[42:39.72]The sun is here.
[42:40.86]Can somebody stop jermaMoon from getting that money?
[42:43.18]It doesn't look like it.
[42:44.08]No, just...
[42:50.39]He has a diamond cutter off the top of the ladder.
[42:53.81]jermaSun to save the day, it seems, from Jermaboon.
[42:57.51]jermaEarth now is up top, and we've got jermaEarth and Jerma Jupiter.
[43:00.85]Is this ever going to end?
[43:05.18]No, no, Jerma Jupiter wants to get up there.
[43:07.00]No, and jermaMars is behind him.
[43:09.48]jermaSaturn.
[43:10.94]Saturn has an opportunity to grab it right now.
[43:14.14]Can he get it?
[43:15.12]No, it looks like jermaMars is trying to throw the whole... They're gonna both throw the ladder over and then for 8 minutes... No he... I don't even know what to say.
[43:27.15]There's too much going on.
[43:28.85]A big right hand... A big right hand onto Jerma Jupiter who has... The ladder is now non-existent.
[43:39.35]You've got jermaMoon, jermaEarth,
[43:42.05]jermaSun it's just Jerma oh boy jermaMars and Jerma Jupiter who just jermaMars just took a huge ladder swing to the face well there's no one to contest this now Jerma Jupiter at the top to get the pretend money everybody's scrambling to get it at the same time now you got the Earth up there and you got Mars trying to push it by himself it looks like Saturn was going to push it the other way no I'm not sure what's going to happen here jermaEarth is now up top
[44:08.63]Well, this could end right now.
[44:11.11]I don't think Saturn is strong enough to push this over by himself.
[44:14.09]He can't do it by himself.
[44:14.97]He's frustrated.
[44:16.69]jermaEarth is going to get that money.
[44:19.55]jermaEarth gets the money.
[44:25.50]Ladies and gentlemen, jermaEarth is going to be deleted from the channel.
[44:34.98]Big suplex to Jerma Jupiter.
[44:37.97]That was unbelievable.
[44:43.77]Take a look at this move right here.
[44:44.91]That's the... I fell down accidentally.
[44:51.62]We got a happy new year coming up here very soon, folks.
[44:55.64]And look, he's gonna open that up.
[44:56.64]He's so happy about it.
[44:58.52]We have it perfectly sealed.
[45:00.58]Nobody can open that.
[45:02.38]I'm the only one that can open that.
[45:03.61]I have the key.
[45:05.57]So very shortly here, he's gonna realize that he's
[45:08.60]He's going to take a little vacation.
[45:11.50]So the Earth has been destroyed.
[45:13.64]Yeah.
[45:18.36]That was amazing.
[45:19.57]That was an awesome match.
[45:23.23]On to the next one.
[45:25.97]We might have a happy New Year situation during this match.
[45:29.81]I can see it happening.
[45:30.79]Oh boy, it's this one.
[45:33.45]Alright.
[45:37.36]There is no... Oh, man, that face.
[45:41.70]Oh, my God.
[45:43.84]Oh, boy.
[45:48.38]There is no stipulation on this one.
[45:51.85]This is just a steel cage match.
[45:53.69]Triple threat.
[45:54.59]Freeway.
[45:58.79]That was intense.
[46:01.77]I was shocked by the outcome of that one.
[46:03.63]I really thought the Saturn was going to get it.
[46:10.87]So no stipulation here.
[46:12.05]This is just a match between... Well, you'll see.
[46:17.54]I guess it can explain itself.
[46:20.24]I don't really need to explain it.
[46:21.28]And you'll see why in about 10 seconds.
[46:28.90]And here we go.
[46:35.18]Again, this is a triple threat cage match between...
[46:39.45]Three versions of Jerma.
[46:42.97]Three versions of the same person.
[46:46.86]And three jokes that people love to say in this chat.
[46:51.66]The first one, let's see if we can find him.
[46:53.18]I can't see him.
[46:53.62]The spotlight hasn't found him yet.
[46:56.36]I'm not sure where he is.
[46:57.30]He probably thinks he was hiding in the crowd.
[47:01.59]He wanted to be very suspicious.
[47:03.21]There's late Jerma.
[47:04.15]There's late Jerma.
[47:09.08]Jerma the late streamer, there he is.
[47:10.52]We thought he was going to come out of the crowd, but... I mean, he was late, apparently.
[47:14.04]He didn't make his cue.
[47:17.31]He didn't do his theatrical cue on time.
[47:20.05]I guess he's going to come down and walk down like a regular person, I guess.
[47:27.34]So there, as you know, Jerma has...
[47:30.53]Has a little bit of potential to... A version of Jerma has a potential to be late to stream sometimes.
[47:36.47]You know, sometimes 7 is the scheduled time.
[47:39.85]Is that 7.15?
[47:43.53]7.30?
[47:43.55]7.25?
[47:45.45]That's soft.
[47:46.81]It's all the same thing.
[47:49.20]And there he is, late Jerma.
[47:52.86]Late streamer comes out first.
[47:54.40]Just to make sure he... Well, he came out first, but he missed his cue.
[48:03.82]15 minutes late.
[48:04.80]That's it.
[48:05.90]What?
[48:08.66]Yeah, he's in a towel too.
[48:11.01]Because sometimes when it's like 7.15 and I'm like, oh.
[48:15.81]Sometimes when it's like 7.15, I just got out of the shower.
[48:19.87]And I'm looking at the clock.
[48:20.65]I'm just like, Jesus Christ.
[48:22.19]And I have to run downstairs with a t-shirt and a towel on.
[48:28.21]Let's see what the next version of Jerma is.
[48:32.65]Grab a Snickers.
[48:34.49]The next Jerma is on its way up now.
[48:40.37]Well, late Jerma is preparing.
[48:42.67]Here comes... Oh, boy.
[48:49.16]Cage is just... And there he is.
[48:50.54]There's the Life is Pain I Hate Jerma from his TV Superstars debut.
[48:55.14]There's Life is Pain.
[49:03.37]This version of Jerma is a multi-millionaire.
[49:08.37]Beautiful wife.
[49:09.41]Three wonderful kids.
[49:11.61]He's landed many commercials.
[49:12.74]He has a lot of TV deals.
[49:18.16]And there he is.
[49:20.08]I would say he's probably the favorite to win this Steel Cage match.
[49:24.54]If not him, then the next one.
[49:28.62]And our third competitor.
[49:29.40]And our last competitor here.
[49:31.32]Until the Rumbles.
[49:32.80]Because this is the last match before the Rumbles.
[49:35.38]We might even have to take a pause and say Happy New Year here.
[49:45.03]The last one, I can't wait for it to be deleted.
[49:49.47]I cannot wait for this next joke, this next stupid fucking meme to go away forever.
[49:54.75]Because like I said, guys, this has killed the meme stream.
[49:58.04]Whoever loses the rumble portion of this, you don't get to say it anymore.
[50:03.94]Now, what's the number one thing that everybody always says?
[50:06.12]To, like, the joke, the meme, oh, how funny it is.
[50:09.80]Let's say it.
[50:11.20]Let's say it.
[50:11.60]Get it out now, because I don't think Short Jerm is going to win.
[50:16.22]Wearing his baby clothes.
[50:19.68]With his nice, like, bald hair.
[50:21.16]You know, he's 5'5".
[50:28.93]Can't wait for this to be done.
[50:32.45]There's the short joke.
[50:36.38]With his little sneakers, his fun sneakers that he got in the first grade.
[50:39.72]That he still fits into.
[50:40.54]You know, face looking like Adam Driver.
[50:47.00]You know, it's no big deal.
[50:56.35]JermaLate is currently eyeing him up and down.
[51:00.27]Trying to see what he's got to... What he's got to work with here.
[51:04.89]He might even be late to get into the ring.
[51:08.21]So here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[51:09.11]Welcome to the Triple Threat.
[51:11.13]Jerma... Oh, jokes.
[51:13.75]God.
[51:15.67]Steel Cage match, as you know.
[51:16.83]Because you just have to escape.
[51:18.95]And whoever escapes wins.
[51:19.83]Nice Snapmare.
[51:22.37]I call everything a Snapmare.
[51:23.55]Because everything is a Snapmare.
[51:26.22]Spends him around.
[51:26.78]Gets on top of him.
[51:29.04]Late.
[51:29.36]Nasty.
[51:29.78]The Jerma late is not even going to contest right now.
[51:32.68]He's going to be late to the fight as well.
[51:34.06]No, no.
[51:34.44]Jerma.
[51:34.98]The short Jerma is not tall enough to grab him.
[51:38.08]His arms are not long enough.
[51:40.44]As you just saw.
[51:41.12]That's the terrible thing about being as short as short Jerma is.
[51:46.40]As late Jerma now finally getting to the party.
[51:48.72]No.
[51:48.98]Gets reversed by short Jerma.
[51:51.19]Into the ropes while TV superstar Life is Pain is queuing up.
[51:55.71]What seems to be maybe... Nothing.
[51:58.30]Nothing at all.
[51:58.70]He just kind of slid down.
[52:00.66]I think he tripped maybe.
[52:01.70]That he was on a slip and slide.
[52:03.24]Big knee by Short Jerma.
[52:04.76]And this is where you're going to see.
[52:06.44]He's got a chip on his shoulder.
[52:08.54]These are the personalities.
[52:09.64]These are my three or five.
[52:10.82]I have like four personalities.
[52:12.20]Three of them are in the ring right now.
[52:15.08]Anger.
[52:15.88]Hatred.
[52:18.28]Discontent.
[52:20.08]Just disruption.
[52:21.32]You are seeing somebody that is angry.
[52:24.89]The personality has been split.
[52:26.33]Late Jerma is lazy.
[52:27.83]TV superstar Jerma is charismatic and fun.
[52:30.70]Short Jerma is fucking angry and is willing to hurt people.
[52:36.86]The dark side.
[52:39.78]Nobody can even attempt to stop Short Jerma.
[52:44.35]Knee right to the face.
[52:50.94]I'm not even... If I were a TV superstar, if I was Life is Pain Jerma, I would probably leave.
[52:56.62]I would just get out of this... I would just walk out.
[53:00.32]No one else has done a move besides Short... Ah, there we go.
[53:03.76]There's a reversal.
[53:04.54]Finally.
[53:06.13]Short Jerma finally gets what's deserved.
[53:09.25]Quell that little man anger.
[53:12.31]Well, Jerma laid his... No, no, no.
[53:14.49]Trying to go... Ooh, he breaks it up.
[53:16.57]Short Jerma, you don't want to give him an opportunity.
[53:21.12]That is pure unadulterated, unadulterated BabyRage.
[53:25.32]See, he can't even make it to the top rope.
[53:26.52]He's a little too small.
[53:28.04]That's as high as he can go.
[53:30.10]Going for a double axel and missed it completely.
[53:33.09]It's okay, though, because life is pain and late Jerma.
[53:36.99]Currently in the corner.
[53:37.63]Now he sees an opportunity to get both in each corner.
[53:40.01]No.
[53:42.19]Right into... No, he reverses it again.
[53:43.83]I thought he was going to throw his back directly into the cage there.
[53:49.85]Short Jerma is gonna try a little bit of his own medicine.
[53:52.79]Throw him into the corner.
[53:55.31]Get him on top, maybe?
[53:56.87]I'm not sure what he's, what the goal here is.
[53:58.81]Doh, wow!
[53:59.60]Smashes his mouth on that really, really nice cushion.
[54:02.84]That doesn't hurt at all.
[54:04.06]But then follows it up with a luthess press!
[54:07.40]Gets a belly-to-back suplex for his trouble and a kick right in his spine.
[54:12.16]Directly in his spine.
[54:14.93]Well, Life is Pain is now going for the same thing.
[54:16.77]We're gonna go for another, like, oh, watch out for the cushiony rubbery thing that you just, like, pretended to touch.
[54:21.93]Wrestling is cool.
[54:24.80]And now just taunting Jerma.
[54:26.06]Taunting short Jerma.
[54:27.76]Look at how, look at how, I can get up on the second rope too, tiny man.
[54:31.10]Wow, that's so funny.
[54:34.80]And for his jokes, he gets a couple of punches right into the back.
[54:38.90]Well, late Jerma is not going to be late to leaving.
[54:42.96]Because that is absolutely true.
[54:44.50]Jerma sometimes will turn his stream on and will just end the stream after two and a half hours.
[54:49.68]So he's late to arrive, but definitely not late to leave.
[54:52.63]Big, gigantic belly-to-back suplex off the cage.
[55:00.01]Absolutely devastating.
[55:02.77]Oh, and just like being thrown around like a little baby.
[55:06.77]Oh no, gets reversed!
[55:08.61]Reversed a... look, almost like a stunner, a chin breaker.
[55:14.90]Of course he can do that.
[55:16.06]Of course he can be lifted that high.
[55:18.90]He's a little bit small, and that's alright.
[55:21.73]It's okay to not be the biggest person in the room.
[55:25.33]You can make up for it in other places.
[55:27.33]Directly into the cage.
[55:28.39]I think Jerma Short is bleeding from his mouth.
[55:33.86]Oh, looks... He's going to kind of throw him around while his short Jerma now might take his opportunity.
[55:39.19]No, late Jerma.
[55:41.79]Into the ropes.
[55:42.61]Big clothesline.
[55:44.29]That almost took his head off.
[55:47.51]Speaking of taking his head off, he's trying... You need to pay attention, late Jerma, because Life is Pain is just taunting the audience.
[55:56.64]No, he's not taunting the audience.
[55:58.48]He's extremely charismatic.
[56:02.02]And late Jerma, of course, is about to end the stream early.
[56:05.37]He's the only person that's tried to leave.
[56:08.19]And I think he's going to be the one to win.
[56:10.67]No one else is even right behind him at all.
[56:12.55]Ladies and gentlemen, late Jerma has won the cage match.
[56:18.29]He's done.
[56:19.17]He streamed for like an hour and 45 minutes.
[56:22.15]Showed up like 45 minutes late and streamed for like an hour.
[56:28.15]Let's take a look at those replays.
[56:29.45]Big DDT there on to Jerma Short.
[56:32.47]And here's late Jerma.
[56:33.95]See, he's like, penis.
[56:35.75]You can't.
[56:36.27]You can't.
[56:37.29]You can't.
[56:37.73]Alright.
[56:44.35]Well, ladies and gentlemen, we're about to move on to our main event of the evening.
[56:52.74]The main event of the evening is the Kill the Meme Rumble.
[56:59.96]There will be two.
[57:02.68]One is going to be a 20-man rumble and one is going to be a 30-man rumble.
[57:08.57]The 20-man rumble is going to be the first one.
[57:10.51]The 30-man rumble is going to incorporate everybody because in the next match, the planets are not in the rumble and neither is +2 and -2.
[57:19.83]They are not in it because they're kind of clones.
[57:22.27]It's all original characters.
[57:24.53]Well, are they?
[57:25.53]Are they really?
[57:27.23]But we're going to wait here for a second.
[57:29.16]Because in about four minutes, not even, in less than four minutes, three minutes, we have a Happy New Year situation.
[57:37.16]And that's when we start the Kill the Meme stream.
[57:40.34]Yeah, we got no clones here.
[57:41.80]No serpents.
[57:43.17]You already saw the serpent match.
[57:47.49]Let's get a good countdown from the timer here.
[57:53.99]Let's get a good Regis Philbin video.
[57:56.24]Hold on.
[57:59.80]Regis Philbin New Year's Countdown.
[58:08.60]I can't hear this.
[58:09.20]Maybe you guys can.
[58:10.04]I gotta be able to hear this.
[58:14.19]I gotta plug this in so I can hear what the hell they're even saying.
[58:22.32]Because I didn't have it queued up.
[58:24.08]Oh, god damn it.
[58:24.72]Hold on.
[58:24.98]Wait, wait, wait.
[58:25.56]Oh, shit.
[58:25.80]I fucking skipped it.
[58:26.54]Hold on.
[58:26.97]I skipped it.
[58:27.83]Wait.
[58:28.01]Hold on.
[58:28.39]Wait, wait, wait.
[58:28.81]Alright.
[58:29.43]I got to count down here.
[58:53.76]We're going to get it on six.
[58:56.32]We're going to get it on six.
[59:00.67]Can I queue this up?
[59:01.33]Alright, we got... We got exactly two minutes until 2005.
[59:07.53]Happy New Year 2005, everybody.
[59:12.45]It's about to be Eastern time.
[59:15.49]I'm going to go say Happy New Year to a couple people.
[59:19.41]I'm going to go say Happy New Year to my girlfriend, first of all.
[59:23.97]Happy New Year to all of you guys.
[59:26.13]Not yet, not yet, wait.
[59:28.63]Shit, now I only have four seconds.
[59:34.12]1158, hold on, we got a minute and a half.
[59:39.54]Look, we got a clock on the screen too.
[59:42.02]We're not gonna be late for this one.
[59:47.62]Alright, take it away.
[59:48.36]Wait, no, what time is it?
[59:51.12]One minute.
[59:52.66]Exactly one minute.
[59:56.84]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[59:58.02]Wait.
[59:59.68]Shit.
[60:03.42]This countdown is not... Alright, we've got 60 seconds.
[60:12.64]60 seconds.
[60:13.56]Starting from right now.
[60:19.81]Oh, god damn it.
[60:20.67]Okay.
[60:21.91]We got 50 seconds.
[60:23.49]Happy New Year, everybody.
[60:24.65]Don't say that yet.
[60:25.61]Just hold on.
[60:26.17]Have like a drink.
[60:27.53]Just like sip a drink for a second.
[60:32.45]Alright.
[60:35.19]Here it comes.
[60:39.45]Oh, shit.
[60:39.67]I lost the clock.
[60:40.17]Where is it?
[60:41.43]30 seconds.
[60:42.27]Oh, my headphones popped up.
[60:44.68]Shit.
[60:45.40]I can't miss it this year.
[60:46.20]I missed it last year.
[60:49.96]Here we go.
[60:52.22]We're about to cross midnight Eastern time.
[60:57.26]15 seconds on the clock.
[61:00.54]Count it down with me.
[61:04.44]10, nine, eight, seven, three, oh, three, two, one.

[62:17.24]In the first minute of the new year?
[62:18.86]Are you serious?
[62:20.98]That's time.
[62:24.24]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the main event.
[62:28.84]Let's go.
[62:31.92]Happy New Year, everybody.
[62:35.88]Happy New Year.
[62:40.90]I'm going to grab one more drink.
[62:44.40]Give me one second.
[62:45.40]Happy New Year.
[62:46.00]I'm going to grab one more cider.
[62:47.90]That's some good fucking... Beer.
[63:03.45]Beer.
[63:50.01]Alright, we have dilly-dallied enough.
[63:55.20]We've messed around enough.
[63:58.28]Let us get to the main event.
[64:09.21]OK, here we go.
[64:20.44]Let's do it.
[64:24.91]This lady is explaining the rules of the Royal Rumble, but in place, I'll give you the actual rules.
[64:32.35]So how this is going to work is all of your favorite jokes from 2017 and a little bit before are going to be in this Rumble.
[64:42.38]If they are eliminated, you can never say them again.
[64:48.46]This is it, guys.
[64:50.32]Whoever wins this rumble is the only joke that gets to survive into 2018.
[64:59.69]Kill the meme stream.
[65:02.89]No messing around.
[65:04.82]If you make one of these jokes that gets eliminated in the new year, you're going to get a timeout.
[65:13.86]It's going to happen.
[65:17.08]You're going to get timed out.
[65:19.64]Try me.
[65:24.19]And that's me.
[65:25.11]That's me.
[65:25.55]That's my voice coming out of this lady.
[65:31.91]Who's the first?
[65:33.11]Who's number?
[65:33.75]Oh, it's the first one to come in is, of course, the censor bar.
[65:37.66]That joke was really funny for quite a while.
[65:39.34]Remember when I made all those censored jokes?
[65:43.89]Not doing that again in 2018.
[65:44.95]And he's number one.
[65:46.75]So good luck.
[65:48.16]You ain't getting out.
[65:50.20]You ain't getting out of this one, censor bar.
[65:56.16]I wonder who's going to be his number two.
[66:01.53]We'll find out.
[66:03.05]You can't ban everybody.
[66:11.39]This wasn't a meme.
[66:12.37]I did this like four times.
[66:15.80]I did the censor bar joke like four or five different times.
[66:19.74]I overdid it.
[66:20.48]It's not happening again.
[66:21.32]No censoring in 2018.
[66:26.10]Everything's gonna be uncensored.
[66:30.92]So who's number two?
[66:31.92]That's what I want to know.
[66:37.55]The crowd is not standing anymore.
[66:40.41]They don't seem to care about whoever number two is.
[66:44.88]Throw me a shirt.
[66:46.48]USA.
[66:51.86]Everybody is just sitting here.
[66:54.14]Why?
[66:54.48]Is it late?
[66:56.08]Is it late, Jerma?
[66:57.67]It is.
[66:59.73]It's going to be late, Jerma.
[67:01.67]I guarantee it.
[67:02.49]It is.
[67:04.21]Yep.
[67:06.91]Number two is late Jerma.
[67:12.69]That couldn't have been planned any better.
[67:14.33]I didn't even do that.
[67:15.81]It just happened on its own.
[67:16.59]Somebody gave $100.
[67:25.46]Oh, goodness.
[67:27.82]Ben Eleanor gave $100.
[67:35.75]Cheers to the new year.
[67:36.61]Cheers to you, man.
[67:37.85]Thank you so much.
[67:40.71]Thank you so much for the $100.
[67:42.15]I did not... This is all random.
[67:43.89]I didn't do anything.
[67:45.43]I did not do shit.
[67:46.31]I actually randomly generated their entrances.
[67:50.06]So I'm absolved of all crimes here.
[67:53.82]I swear to God I didn't fucking do this.
[67:57.50]Guys, I barely got the stream to start at 11pm.
[67:59.64]You think I rigged it?
[68:03.68]Cheers to that.
[68:08.43]so again late Jerma is going to be a thing of the past that late joke is not going to be you're not going to be able to do it anymore because there's no way he's going to make it to the final this is a 20-man rumble the first one's 20. everybody gets one more chance though move for that entrance
[68:36.31]But he won.
[68:37.67]He won it being late.
[68:41.63]No, you can't be late.
[68:42.67]No, I can be late.
[68:43.45]You just can't make fun of me and make the late jokes.
[68:45.88]Even when I'm not late.
[68:47.88]I look over in this chat.
[68:49.84]Sometimes.
[68:50.90]And it's like 6.52.
[68:53.26]And I see people writing late.
[68:55.90]Welcome to Kill the Meme stream.
[68:57.94]Immediately the censor bar is probably going to get thrown out.
[69:00.03]I hope he does.
[69:02.60]Sponsored by KFC.
[69:04.52]It's not, though.
[69:05.00]It's not.
[69:05.48]It's not.
[69:06.56]I can't say that out loud.
[69:07.98]Probably shouldn't say that.
[69:09.42]Anyways, every 60 seconds, somebody else comes into the ring.
[69:13.98]Got nice camera work.
[69:15.38]Wow.
[69:15.94]Royal Rumble.
[69:18.01]Censor bar immediately going up to the top ropes.
[69:20.35]We've got a 10-second counter here without wasting any time.
[69:26.45]Two, one.
[69:28.21]Here it comes.
[69:29.49]BaldCoin is coming in at number three.
[69:34.29]You're not going to be able to say bald coin anymore, and neither am I. There he is.
[69:38.51]Look at how shiny and wonderful he is.
[69:41.35]One of the top cryptocurrencies.
[69:43.42]Bald coin.
[69:47.04]He wants it bad.
[69:48.16]I'm going to make a prediction here.
[69:50.08]This shiny bald fuck is going to make it.
[69:52.94]He's going to win.
[69:53.56]Look at that big sweeping kick.
[69:59.10]Oh, they're coming in quick now.
[70:00.88]Six seconds remaining.
[70:02.91]But we got BaldCoin, LateJerma, and TheSensorBar in the ring right now.
[70:05.75]And coming in next, countdown's already there.
[70:08.46]It's Jerma's IQ!
[70:10.64]Jerma's 126 IQ.
[70:12.64]You make one of these jokes, he gets eliminated, you're fucking banned.
[70:15.86]You're out of here.
[70:17.26]126 IQ making the... Looks kind of like the Joker, but it's supposed to be Albert Einstein.
[70:22.98]BaldCoin and Jerma's IQ are fighting in the ring right now.
[70:27.90]And Jerma Late is about to be eliminated, but we never see that joke ever again in chat.
[70:32.63]I think it's possible!
[70:35.26]No, is it?
[70:35.96]Is it?
[70:36.86]No!
[70:37.12]He's just barely just stays on.
[70:39.26]Hangs on for dear life as Bald Coin and the Joker Einstein.
[70:44.30]And here comes the owl!
[70:46.78]Or the OWO bulge!
[70:48.36]They're coming in really fucking fast!
[70:51.36]And there he is!
[70:52.78]For the longest time, like I told you, I thought this was somebody making an owl face, so that's what it is.
[70:57.37]It's either somebody's dick, or it's an owl.
[70:59.73]And there they are.
[71:00.69]Good luck making that joke ever again in 2018.
[71:02.33]OWO.
[71:06.13]The owl.
[71:06.57]Get rid of him immediately.
[71:07.51]Throw him over!
[71:08.67]Throw him over, censor!
[71:10.68]God dammit, why does Albert Einstein look like the Joker?
[71:14.34]And why is there so many people coming in?
[71:17.16]No one's been eliminated yet.
[71:18.32]You can still make these jokes.
[71:19.58]Make them now.
[71:20.82]Jermacraft is coming in at 6.
[71:25.51]Not a bad position to be.
[71:26.53]Almost halfway there.
[71:27.45]Well, not even close.
[71:30.05]As Albert the Joker Einstein is picking up the sensor bar.
[71:33.65]Well, BaldCoin is right when Jermacraft comes in.
[71:36.29]Couple of right hands.
[71:38.43]I love BaldCoin.
[71:40.68]I think a lot of people in here love baldcorn.
[71:42.60]So him being eliminated would be really sad.
[71:45.39]Big right hand by Albert IQ Einstein.
[71:48.65]Baldcorn now into the corner.
[71:49.81]Don't want to be in the corner.
[71:51.21]Don't get eliminated by Jerma's dumb IQ.
[71:53.05]Please.
[71:55.33]Oh!
[71:56.14]There goes Jerma late.
[71:57.72]And here comes the comb streamer.
[72:00.30]There'll be no more ComStream jokes and no more ComStreamer in 2018.
[72:04.34]Guaranteed.
[72:04.92]There he is.
[72:06.12]With his beautiful hair.
[72:07.13]The late stream.
[72:08.43]You can no longer say late Jerma anymore.
[72:11.77]It is now no longer allowed.
[72:14.35]But I will give a grace period of 48 hours.
[72:19.29]And immediately OWO is going to get dumped out by the ComStreamer.
[72:23.54]Jermacraft is also gone.
[72:24.84]CensorBar is gone now too.
[72:26.96]They are trying to... ComStreamer doesn't even care.
[72:30.48]He gave up on OWO.
[72:31.90]JermaCraft, you can no longer ever ask me to play JermaCraft.
[72:34.50]But here comes some free shit!
[72:38.54]Free shit's about to enter the ring.
[72:41.54]And it's just a Razor Death Adder!
[72:44.96]Wow!
[72:45.42]We've been graced by its presence!
[72:48.32]I really hope it makes it so I can say that one more time.
[72:52.02]Bald coin looks like it's going to be going out here.
[72:54.95]Bald coin!
[72:55.81]No!
[72:56.15]Thank god!
[72:56.71]Bald coin's still in it.
[72:59.07]You got free shit.
[73:05.35]Oh my god, Albert Einstein is up on OWO's head while FreeShit is trying to make ComStreamer put the comb down and pick up a goddamn textbook.
[73:17.69]As the Joker, I keep calling him the Joker, it's not the Joker, it's Albert Einstein.
[73:21.11]10 seconds.
[73:23.39]Nice reversal there by BaldCoin.
[73:26.38]Shiny gold.
[73:28.38]Who's coming in now?
[73:30.72]ShortTurbo.
[73:33.25]is the next contestant at number 9.
[73:34.95]Short Jerma's coming in right now.
[73:42.51]What the hell was that sound?
[73:46.12]Now we got... Short Jerma is actually, weirdly enough, like, as tall as Albert Einstein.
[73:52.04]No, he's shorter than Albert Einstein.
[73:53.86]Why about 10%?
[73:54.74]10 seconds on the clock.
[73:58.30]We got a full ring.
[74:00.00]What's the next joke to be eliminated?
[74:05.03]two one here comes the counting meme oh that's so funny too right and the sweet chin music on the short Jerma bald coin to eliminate short term you can no longer say that and here comes the counting joke and just from casey just in case he forgot how to count to a hundred it's on his baby bib well short Jerma has been eliminated
[74:31.12]Bald coin with at least a couple of eliminations under his belt here.
[74:34.30]Short Jerma is also... You are not allowed to say that ever again.
[74:40.92]Wow.
[74:46.46]And here comes the no rewind joke.
[74:49.97]Rewind to Flanker.
[74:51.23]Rewind to this.
[74:52.63]Oh, no rewinds.
[74:53.73]There he is.
[74:55.27]Flanker adorning some casual garb.
[74:58.70]Not really putting on his, uh, his ceremonial assassin garb, but as he's got the, uh, please be kind rewind and, uh, baby, baby counter might immediately eliminate him.
[75:09.09]Nope, almost.
[75:12.69]Well, BaldCoin and FreeShit are currently in the corner fighting over who gets to, who's worth more money is essentially what's going on over there.
[75:22.39]Is the sponsorship worth more money or is BaldCoin worth more money right now?
[75:26.71]See, that's a question I can't answer.
[75:29.72]Oh, great.
[75:30.74]Number 12.
[75:32.72]It's everybody's favorite.
[75:34.48]It's another emote that I can't wait for it to get fucking deleted.
[75:37.99]It's the next meme.
[75:40.13]Next is currently in the ring right now at number 12.
[75:45.63]Oh, these are getting deleted, baby.
[75:48.34]Kill the memes.
[75:50.02]Big right hand by Baldcoin does not surpass the wealth of Razor Death Adder, though.
[75:55.33]Even though he tried well, now OWO's in trouble.
[75:57.69]OWO is gone.
[75:59.06]And so is Albert Einstein.
[76:01.46]The counting meme has eliminated both OWO.
[76:05.72]Oh, and CCC.
[76:08.64]What is CCC?
[76:09.56]I don't know.
[76:12.24]Oh, that's Coffee Cheetos Chicken.
[76:15.82]Coffee Cheetos Chicken is firing up this crowd right now.
[76:21.13]Are we gonna be able to see an end to Coffees Cheetos Chicken?
[76:24.39]Bald's coin is gone!
[76:26.13]The counting meme has eliminated one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies.
[76:32.03]I can now no longer make that joke for the rest of my life.
[76:35.67]Bald's coin is gone.
[76:38.16]And here comes Coffees Cheetos Chicken.
[76:41.38]Next is currently on dire straits right now, although no rewinds currently has Coffees Cheetos Chicken.
[76:46.46]No, Coffees Cheetos Chicken with a huge knee!
[76:50.03]Free shit is still here.
[76:53.89]And currently trying to fend off the giant baby.
[76:57.91]Couple of right hands.
[76:58.49]Oh, they got like six right hands.
[77:01.42]Into a left-handed left kick.
[77:03.82]What does that mean?
[77:05.30]Nice elbow there into the sternum of the counting meme.
[77:09.00]Coffee Cheetos Chicken does not want to be deleted.
[77:11.47]He's gonna go, although he's not.
[77:13.39]He's gonna get reversed by the counting meme.
[77:16.91]Who is Babyface?
[77:17.65]Babyface is the counting meme.
[77:19.05]People count in my chat.
[77:21.11]Like to 100.
[77:22.45]And there goes free shit!
[77:24.37]No Rewinds just decimates free shit.
[77:28.93]Razer DeathAdder sponsorship.
[77:30.33]Coffee Cheetos Chicken now trying to get No Rewinds.
[77:32.29]Flanker might want to think about rewinding back to fucking 2016.
[77:39.47]Next is going to... Hey, how mad would you guys be if Next eliminated Coffee Cheetos Chicken?
[77:47.83]I'm sure a lot of you people would be very upset about that.
[77:49.53]And it's probably going to happen.
[77:50.27]Look at it right here.
[77:51.37]Coffee Cheetos Chicken just got eliminated by Next.
[77:54.96]Do you understand?
[77:56.32]Next is nexting your favorite memes right now.
[78:00.84]Oh, here comes Jeff from Psychology 101.
[78:02.90]It's the time serpent.
[78:05.14]Yeah, you didn't think there was going to be a fucking serpent?
[78:15.19]He just destroys the counting meme.
[78:18.67]Just absolutely decimating.
[78:20.89]Next.
[78:21.47]Is next going to get eliminated?
[78:23.35]I hope so.
[78:24.03]Because fuck that meme.
[78:27.57]As the time, as Jeff from Psychology is currently going to get eliminated.
[78:30.15]But no.
[78:30.47]I think this next contestant might just be slightly laughing about it a little bit.
[78:34.98]You know what I mean?
[78:37.34]Laughing about it a little bit.
[78:38.32]It's currently in the ring.
[78:40.24]While next is just taunting.
[78:43.32]While Counting Meme is now going for a right hand.
[78:49.54]I can't, man.
[78:50.76]It's too fucking stupid.
[78:53.16]The Counting Baby is still here.
[78:55.57]If the Counting Baby wins, I'm gonna be so mad.
[78:59.23]That was a shit character that was supposed to be eliminated.
[79:01.19]It's in a second.
[79:04.33]But now the Counting Meme has Jeff from Psychology up.
[79:07.90]Here comes Life is Pain.
[79:10.28]Life is Pain is coming in at 16.
[79:13.92]You might be able to hold on to this meme.
[79:16.26]So currently we've got Jeff from Psychology, the counting meme.
[79:19.43]Life is Pain, I'm laughing about it a little bit.
[79:21.43]And the next meme, currently in the ring at the same time.
[79:25.89]Which one of these would you rather keep?
[79:27.33]As the counting baby is about to be dumped.
[79:30.43]Is he going to be able to go over the ring?
[79:31.97]He's been so good in this rumble.
[79:34.72]He's been such a strong memer.
[79:37.84]I don't think he's going to get eliminated, but no, he's not strong enough.
[79:40.76]Next might be coming in.
[79:41.86]Next is going to help him.
[79:43.24]They know how strong he is.
[79:44.94]And... Oh, boy.
[79:49.14]You know who's coming in now.
[79:51.96]That's Acid Base.
[79:54.60]Acid Base from the movies.
[79:58.06]He's got a stereo in his ass.
[80:01.58]And it's not... Hold on a second.
[80:04.02]Just wait a minute.
[80:09.72]There it is!
[80:11.24]Why is it still playing?
[80:15.03]There it is!
[80:16.35]Hey, acid bass is in the rumble!
[80:18.53]Here he comes!
[80:19.47]He's got stereo speakers in his ass!
[80:22.79]Loud P is the next contestant at number 18, here they come!
[80:29.43]The Loud P meme that everybody loves so much, there he is!
[80:32.84]Covered in toilets, covered in urine!
[80:38.07]AcidBase is currently being punched in the face.
[80:40.31]Is AcidBase gonna get eliminated?
[80:42.05]AcidBase might get powerbombed over the top ropes!
[80:46.97]AcidBase is gone!
[80:54.11]You can now no longer say, use AcidBase as a meme anymore.
[81:00.85]The counting meme, here comes a seagull!
[81:03.99]The counting meme stays in it.
[81:06.83]The counting meme stays in.
[81:09.28]And now it's gone.
[81:10.54]The counting meme is gone and so is... Oh my god, your favorite memes left and right.
[81:14.74]There's your Seagull.
[81:16.36]Is in the ring right now.
[81:19.50]I gotta drink.
[81:20.16]This is like too intense for me.
[81:21.62]Oh, life is pain.
[81:23.59]Almost.
[81:24.81]There goes Next.
[81:26.57]Next is... In fact, I'm gonna delete Next now.
[81:29.37]I'm gonna go... Next is... The Seagull comes in and eliminates Next immediately.
[81:32.75]I'm gonna delete him right now.
[81:35.87]You can now no longer say next in 2018.
[81:37.51]The emote's getting deleted.
[81:41.37]Loud P now has him laughing about it a little bit.
[81:43.63]No, he just reversed by the dropkick.
[81:46.60]Life is pain.
[81:49.12]Seagull.
[81:50.96]Laughing about it.
[81:52.18]Loud P. Who is the next contestant?
[81:54.96]There's only one more.
[81:57.18]There's only one more contestant.
[81:58.40]It's Mod Kyle.
[82:01.99]Remember this one?
[82:04.54]One of these gets to stay in 2018.
[82:08.15]Which one do you want?
[82:09.95]There's the new mod, Kyle.
[82:11.67]And if he wins, Kyle gets actually moderated.
[82:13.97]There it goes.
[82:14.33]I'm laughing about it.
[82:17.01]Why is Jeff from Psychology still in this?
[82:19.62]And there goes the Seagull.
[82:20.46]No, Loud P does not get enough.

[82:32.11]A Seagull in Life is Pain.
[82:34.15]Big swinging, big swinging diamond cutter there by Loud P. Mod Kyle.
[82:42.30]It just comes right in and gets immediately destroyed.
[82:46.08]Big!
[82:46.56]Wow!
[82:47.98]Did you just see the Seagull take flight?
[82:50.34]Right into Life is Pain.
[82:51.82]That took a lot.
[82:52.30]That was a special move.
[82:54.34]That was the Seagull's finishing move.
[82:58.56]Used every ounce of strength he had to do that.
[83:03.15]Jeff from Psychology, please somebody eliminate him.
[83:05.55]He is so fucking worthless.
[83:07.49]I don't want to see that in my chat in 2018.
[83:12.29]It's like so stupid and so old.
[83:13.75]He was a shit character.
[83:14.69]He better not win.
[83:16.25]I've said that about three people now.
[83:18.19]And they're going, oh, Loud P almost throws with sheer strength the Seagull over the top ropes.
[83:24.56]Mod Kyle now might be in trouble.
[83:28.76]And we've got a chokeslam situation by JeffFromPsychology to the seagull!
[83:34.06]He's gone.
[83:36.96]The Time Serpent JeffFromPsychology replacement, like, Kripparian meme.
[83:42.19]That's not even mine.
[83:44.51]That's somebody else's.
[83:46.17]Get out of here.
[83:48.51]Get this fucking fraud out of here.
[83:50.09]I don't want him in here.
[83:53.21]Loud P Mod Kyle.
[83:55.33]Life is pain.
[83:57.62]Jeff from psychology.
[84:02.74]Seagull's literally dead.
[84:05.74]Life is pain.
[84:06.97]Life is pain.
[84:07.67]Got him.
[84:08.29]He's gonna give him a taste of his own medicine because life... Oh, no.
[84:12.31]I was gonna say the line.
[84:15.33]What have you done?
[84:17.29]Why would you do... You have such an opportunity.
[84:19.36]Jeff from psychology has eliminated like five people.
[84:23.84]Nice flying knee right in the face of life is pain.
[84:28.44]One of these gets a stick.
[84:30.66]And it sickens me that one of them is probably... There's a high probability that it's going to be the Time Serpent Aniland or Jeff from Psychology.
[84:43.42]Well, Mod Kyle is taking a little bit of time to rest.
[84:46.78]Trying to build a little bit of strength here.
[84:49.98]Loud P has... No, here we go.
[84:51.95]Jeff, come on.
[84:53.81]Come on, Mod Kyle.
[84:54.75]Use those moderation powers and ban this motherfucker.
[84:58.53]Oh, he's just a little too tall.
[85:00.27]What that little nudge.
[85:02.67]Oh!
[85:04.23]Big right-handed clothesline.
[85:06.02]Ladies and gentlemen, your two memes that might survive.
[85:08.84]Mod Kyle and Loud P. Life is Pain is gone.
[85:14.74]Which meme survives in 2018?
[85:17.78]Is Mod Kyle going to win?
[85:20.30]Loud P just took so much strength to do the big clothesline onto Life is Pain.
[85:27.66]He's got moderation powers.
[85:28.76]This might be very difficult.
[85:31.86]Loud P going onto the top ropes.
[85:33.32]That's a dangerous place to be in a rumble.
[85:35.06]You don't want to be up there, man.
[85:39.18]And he completely missed.
[85:40.08]That might be his dom.
[85:40.94]No, that was going to be the downfall.
[85:43.90]Not quite the downfall yet.
[85:45.98]As Loud P is now on the ropes.
[85:47.96]Mod Kyle.
[85:50.56]Mod Kyle is the one meme that gets to stay.
[85:53.36]We have a new moderator.
[86:11.35]I don't even know- I can't- What?
[86:14.25]Why?
[86:14.62]I don't even remember what that guy's fucking name was.
[86:20.36]What was that guy's name?
[86:22.70]I don't even remember who he was.
[86:27.13]It was like eight months ago.
[86:42.93]Oh, this has been too much, man.
[86:44.19]I can't even, like, I can't even fucking take it.
[86:47.54]Ugh.
[86:54.82]I'm getting, like, a bloody nose.
[86:58.21]It's up.
[86:58.53]Hey, but wait a minute.
[86:59.87]You guys think that's it?
[87:00.75]It's not over.
[87:01.39]It's not over, guys.
[87:02.31]It's not over.
[87:02.89]We got one more to do.
[87:03.95]Because guess what?
[87:09.49]Kyle gets to stay.
[87:10.89]Mod Kyle stays as a joke for 2018.
[87:18.07]But we're doing another rumble because one more gets to stay.
[87:22.41]And this one has 30 people in it, including the planets.
[87:28.57]And if a planet gets eliminated, it don't matter.
[87:31.23]They have tenure.
[87:32.60]It's going to be even harder for your favorite memes.
[87:37.06]Let's do it again.
[87:39.31]Last chance.
[87:45.31]+2 and -2 are also going to be in this.
[87:48.27]So you might be able to save those as well.
[87:56.33]Kyle.
[87:57.71]I'm like, is it bad that like half of me is annoyed that I have to mod some guy?
[88:07.63]rewind to the beginning of the rewind before the rewind was eliminated oh that's so funny I've been like such a mess like I haven't been able to even commentate this it's been it's been so all over the place I've just I've been just watching this and enjoying this with you guys I'm not like doing any like witty funny commentary because this is as funny to me as it is to you this is so stupid
[88:37.00]Let's go.
[88:39.76]Last chance for your favorite memes.
[88:42.52]Here we go.
[88:45.75]Streamer thinks he can end memes with a game.
[88:48.25]Oh, yeah, he can.
[88:48.91]Who are the first two?
[88:57.53]Kyle's also in this.
[88:59.55]So watch him win again.
[89:02.61]I can't even take him out.
[89:05.14]I can't take Kyle out of the rumble, so like he's in it again.
[89:08.42]So Kyle is gonna win again, and I'm gonna laugh my fucking ass off.
[89:17.03]Alright, let's just go right to it.
[89:19.02]Bingo.
[89:20.38]Who's in?
[89:21.86]Standing ovation.
[89:23.66]Okay, no rewinds is guaranteed to lose.
[89:27.50]Because in this stupid video game, they make it so, like, the last 10 people are the ones that actually win.
[89:33.22]So, guaranteed, you will, no rewinds is killed.
[89:36.64]Kill the meme.
[89:40.73]Big wow.
[89:45.19]I love how somebody in the chat just wrote, that's fine.
[89:47.85]No, that's alright.
[89:48.41]I'm okay with that.
[89:49.01]Alright, what's next?
[89:56.47]Big wow.
[89:59.13]I've had a few drinks, guys.
[90:00.43]Come on, give me a break.
[90:02.05]This took like 21 hours to make.
[90:05.25]I'm a little drunk right now.
[90:06.91]I've had like six drinks.
[90:09.66]I'm enjoying myself.
[90:11.16]Cheers to that.
[90:12.46]Wait, is that 2017?
[90:16.52]Who is it?
[90:16.82]Is it GermanLate again?
[90:18.80]You guys know that I couldn't have fucking faked it if that's the case.
[90:25.46]That's jermaEarth.
[90:26.17]Good.
[90:26.63]One of the planets is going to be gone immediately.
[90:28.11]Don't worry.
[90:31.06]And guess what?
[90:32.14]It doesn't matter because he's already gone anyways.
[90:38.76]Let's do it.
[90:39.24]Here we go.
[90:42.19]Use it while you can, you get 48 hours.
[90:44.69]By my next stream is when all these are gonna take into effect.
[90:49.87]Use them while you can.
[90:53.82]It's gonna get purged, you're gonna get timed out.
[90:55.72]If you do it more than once, you're gonna get like 30 minutes.
[90:58.70]It's not a joke.
[91:00.78]I didn't go through all the trouble to do this.
[91:02.84]Wow.
[91:03.50]And right off the bat.
[91:07.42]That was beautiful.
[91:10.01]And jermaEarth, I think, knows he's been eliminated.
[91:12.85]And good.
[91:13.39]Get all the planets in, like, the first five.
[91:15.01]Good.
[91:17.43]When you know... See, he backstage was just told he was fired, so I think he's gonna try to kill someone.
[91:22.85]Like, talking about really kill the meme, jermaEarth is going to kill No Rewinds.
[91:27.75]Got jermaEarth, jermaSun, and No Rewinds in the ring, the first three.
[91:31.53]30 people in this rumble.
[91:35.65]Oh, by the way, if the Earth wins, then yes, he is saved.
[91:39.96]Absolutely.
[91:41.62]I'll take that, yeah.
[91:43.16]He's not going to.
[91:44.86]If he does, then he comes back.
[91:49.06]Here comes Mod Kyle, who's already made it.
[91:52.12]He's just here for show now.
[91:55.30]Maybe he'll put on a show.
[91:58.85]Watch him eliminate everyone.
[92:00.74]All your favorites.
[92:01.38]I hope Mod Kyle eliminates all of your favorites.
[92:05.70]No, it gets reversed by jermaEarth.
[92:09.64]God damn it, Kyle.
[92:13.31]Oh, by the way, if... I forgot to mention, the first person that gets eliminated, their meme status does get revoked.
[92:20.39]So if Mod Kyle gets eliminated first, his meme status gets revoked.
[92:28.12]That's how it works.
[92:28.94]You can't be the first one out.
[92:30.86]That's how this is going to work.
[92:33.34]Here comes the Seagull.
[92:35.48]That's the worst character I made by far in this Rumble.
[92:39.18]He's so bad.
[92:39.86]He's got painted legs and a beak.
[92:47.32]It's rigged.
[92:48.44]You're not going to have to worry about that because no Rewinds is going to get out first.
[92:55.75]No, jermaSun breaks that up very, very quickly.
[93:00.46]Fill the ring.
[93:00.92]I'm going to get eight people in here.
[93:01.98]Here comes Jupiter.
[93:02.62]All the planets are going to be in here.
[93:03.72]And they're all going to get... It's going to be perfect.
[93:06.32]Big Hurricane Rana on jermaEarth by the Seagull.
[93:09.48]jermaSun seems to be being dragged.
[93:13.70]We're just getting a repeat of the second match.
[93:16.35]That's fine.
[93:20.72]Oh, we got two opportunities here.
[93:22.16]Mod Kyle, is he going to get his meme status revoked for being the first elimination?
[93:27.62]No, he's not.
[93:29.38]And neither is jermaSun.
[93:32.44]jermaEarth still hot.
[93:33.16]Remember, jermaEarth was one of the first contestants.
[93:36.77]One of the first three.
[93:38.55]Here comes Saturn.
[93:41.15]This is gonna be a planet fight.
[93:43.59]Oh man, one of them's gonna win.
[93:46.33]If jermaEarth wins, I swear to God, I am going to... I don't even know what I'm gonna do.
[93:54.47]There's seven people in the ring.
[93:55.67]What is jermaEarth doing?
[93:57.77]He's like pretend fighting people.
[94:02.75]Jervis Saturn picking up Jervis Sun to dump him over the top ropes.
[94:06.43]No, not yet.
[94:07.09]We're going to have eight people in the ring.
[94:09.56]Oh, there's me.
[94:10.54]It's been revoked.
[94:12.66]It's been revoked.
[94:14.48]It's been revoked.
[94:17.14]It's anybody's game now.
[94:19.38]It is anybody's game.
[94:23.05]One of these is going to win.
[94:25.59]Kyle eliminated.
[94:26.87]First meme status revoked.
[94:28.87]Free shit coming in.
[94:30.23]Throwing free shit to the crowd.
[94:31.57]Free Razer death adders.
[94:43.57]Only one fucking meme survives.
[94:46.09]Don't you guys get this?
[94:48.59]Have you not been paying attention?
[94:53.20]Guile's gone.
[94:54.46]That's it.
[94:55.48]Whoever wins this is the real winner.
[94:59.45]Rigged.
[95:00.39]No!
[95:00.91]This is all random.
[95:01.89]I have no control over any of this shit.
[95:04.91]It just played out the way that we thought.
[95:06.83]Just played out the way that we wanted.
[95:08.43]You can't pick somebody to win.
[95:10.67]Go look it up.
[95:12.89]Go try to do it.
[95:13.59]You can't.
[95:13.99]You can't pick somebody to win.
[95:17.27]It's just fate.
[95:18.77]That was fate.
[95:22.06]And we got a big belly-to-belly suplex there onto free shit.
[95:26.81]jermaEarth is still here.
[95:27.71]Big rigged.
[95:36.79]Big rigged, huh?
[95:38.43]Is the Seagull gonna go out?
[95:39.33]No, Seagull's gonna reverse it on jermaEarth.
[95:42.07]Get another planet in here so a planet doesn't get, like, double meme status.
[95:49.96]What's it gonna be?
[95:50.58]We've got...
[95:52.89]Life is pain at number 9.
[95:53.91]Big punch there onto Jerma-Jupiter.
[95:59.47]Jerma-Saturn now.
[96:01.81]Man, I wouldn't... Seriously, you couldn't write this shit.
[96:06.11]If Jerma-Earth wins and gets his meme status back... This... I... Somebody's fucking with my game if that happens.
[96:16.10]I swear to God.
[96:18.06]There goes no rewind.
[96:19.36]See you later.
[96:20.10]Never again.
[96:21.84]And life is pain, my thesis might be taken back here.
[96:27.22]No, there he goes.
[96:29.22]Sorry, jermaEarth.
[96:29.96]You're going to go on like a seven-month vacation.
[96:34.77]jermaSaturn, Jerma Jupiter, free shit, life is pain, and the seagull.
[96:40.93]They're trying to fight for their meme status, because as we just saw, Kyle got his meme status revoked after that absolutely just despicable display.
[96:51.16]First elimination.
[96:52.10]Like, come on, man.
[96:53.66]Give me a break.
[96:56.66]Next contestant coming in.
[97:01.46]Is I'm laughing about it a little bit.
[97:02.56]And that's a double.
[97:03.42]Well, I thought he was going to throw.
[97:05.23]I thought he was going to absolutely just stretch press him over the ropes.
[97:10.09]Here comes I'm laughing about it a little bit.
[97:13.35]All of the people in the ring right now have a severe disadvantage.
[97:18.02]Hopefully one of your favorites is still there, and if... It's gonna be a planet.
[97:23.24]Oh, there goes Life is Pain!
[97:25.10]Just flipped over and tripped over the ropes.
[97:27.64]Nothing even happened to him.
[97:32.06]Double knee into the gut of laughing about it a little bit there.
[97:37.61]As you can see, Jerma Jupiter is... Somebody just needs to push him out.
[97:41.21]Hopefully free shit takes the opportunity.
[97:44.71]Karate chop into the neck of jermaSaturn.
[97:49.86]Oh, he's going for it.
[97:50.44]Ooh, off the ropes.
[97:51.76]To the bottom.
[97:52.93]The soles of the shoes.
[97:54.03]Right into the face of Free Shift.
[97:57.09]Big wow.
[97:58.03]It's so loud.
[97:58.99]Oh, let me fix that.
[98:02.13]And over the ropes, it seems.
[98:03.97]I'm laughing about it a little bit.
[98:05.11]Might be taken over.
[98:07.85]No, he's fighting for dear life in his Jester costume.
[98:11.17]Reverses it.
[98:11.69]Here comes Short Jerma, who gets his last opportunity to stay alive for 2018.
[98:17.84]There goes the Seagull.
[98:19.32]Laughing about it a little bit gets the Seagull in hit for his trouble.
[98:23.72]Gets a pancake by Jerma Jupiter.
[98:27.33]And Jerma Short just throws.
[98:31.19]Just tosses like he was a ball of cotton.
[98:34.75]That Razor Death Adder.
[98:36.99]Free shit is gone.
[98:41.21]And here comes next.
[98:43.58]Next is number 12, almost to the halfway point.
[98:46.82]Oh, Jerma's short.
[98:49.28]Oh, Guts' clothesline, not over the top ropes, but just barely into the ropes.
[98:54.69]Still two planets in here.
[98:57.29]And remember, the planets are in here just to make this more difficult for the shit memes.
[99:01.07]Remember.
[99:01.41]That's really important to remember.
[99:04.83]If a planet wins, and there you go, laughing about it a little bit, just a small amount, just eliminated Jerma Jupiter.
[99:11.74]It gets that much easier for one of these shit memes to stay alive.
[99:17.39]Here comes late Jerma.
[99:19.27]At number 13.
[99:23.21]Who's still in it?
[99:24.61]Who still could be in it?
[99:26.21]Jerma Jupiter taking a long time to leave.
[99:30.77]Jerma Short maybe persevere through this whole thing.
[99:32.93]Jerma late.
[99:34.92]Could stay in it and persevere through the whole thing.
[99:38.28]Or could he just get eliminated by himself?
[99:42.32]And there goes jermaSaturn.
[99:43.52]The planets are gone.
[99:45.46]There are only, I believe, two more planets.
[99:49.94]Jerma getting as far up on the ropes as he can, like I said previously.
[99:52.73]And Jerma late as might get next in here.
[99:55.43]He does not.
[99:57.37]No, that's not true.
[99:59.21]He's got a huge, gross foot in his mouth.
[100:02.70]Stops it pre.
[100:03.70]No, no, no, no, no.
[100:04.44]Is he going to reverse it now?
[100:05.44]He spins him around.
[100:07.50]Big belly to back suplex.
[100:11.16]Somebody saved the planet.
[100:12.68]Piledriver, that move is illegal.
[100:15.72]Jerma just did a move that has been banned since 2002.
[100:18.12]You understand?
[100:21.04]That's how fucked up and angry and desperate he is.
[100:26.14]Loud P coming in at 14.
[100:27.14]I think a lot of people want to see Loud P survive.
[100:37.91]Actually, I could do with any of these.
[100:40.65]Except for short, Jerma.
[100:42.27]And next.
[100:43.95]I hope next gets eliminated right now.
[100:48.49]The countdown meme.
[100:50.23]Counting still is not in here.
[100:52.05]You are right, Sensor Bar was in here first, right?
[100:56.48]Here comes Acid Base, but I don't have the music ready, so just pretend it's here.
[101:01.52]Oh, I gotta do it.
[101:03.02]Fine.
[101:06.30]I gotta do the- Gotta do the music!
[101:12.97]Oh, there goes next!
[101:14.67]Next is gone.
[101:16.47]Thank goodness.
[101:22.79]That was loud.
[101:24.71]Hey, he's got the stereo, he's got the speaker in his ass.
[101:27.42]Next is gone, it's a thank goodness.
[101:29.22]Get it out of your system now, because it's not gonna be there two days from now.
[101:33.02]Here comes the sensor bar.
[101:34.62]At number 16, more than halfway there now.
[101:39.88]Next emote.
[101:40.60]Yeah, here's the sensor bar.
[101:45.47]Do I have to keep this music playing until he gets eliminated?
[101:47.79]I think I do.
[101:51.22]No more next.
[101:53.24]Oh, happy days.
[101:54.08]We don't ever have to look at it again.
[101:57.46]Belly to back suplex by... Loud P. What is he doing?
[102:01.52]He's being, like, very watery.
[102:04.90]Taunting the crowd with his absolute viscosity.
[102:08.22]There goes laughing about it a little bit.
[102:10.69]Coffee Cheetos Chicken making his debut into 17 here.
[102:16.80]It's not playing.
[102:17.58]Yes, it is.
[102:18.00]It's right there.
[102:24.14]You can hear it.
[102:28.63]You guys can't hear it?
[102:29.57]Yes, you can.
[102:33.41]There goes loud P. See an arrow.
[102:35.65]See an arrow.
[102:37.34]Loud P in short Jerma might be quick work here.
[102:42.91]Trying to dump.
[102:44.07]There goes late Jerma.
[102:45.15]Will the other Jerma go to short Jerma?
[102:48.75]Desperately fends off both Coffee Cheetos Chicken and the Sensor Bar while Acid Base... Still sticking around.
[102:55.95]What the fuck just happened?
[102:58.92]What just happened?
[103:03.66]Somebody did a backflip.
[103:07.22]I don't know why they did that.
[103:10.72]I want to turn this off.
[103:11.48]So somebody eliminate acid base right now, please.
[103:14.58]So this music can turn off.
[103:21.39]Come on.
[103:21.73]Somebody push him out.
[103:24.21]Just like take your foot and just shove him out, please.
[103:30.70]People keep giving up on short Jerma.
[103:33.22]He has the... I think he has the viscosity.
[103:35.08]I think he has the wherewithal.
[103:38.68]What a reverse powerbomb onto the sensor bar.
[103:44.62]You guys can hear the music, give me a break.
[103:50.99]Here comes Psychology 101 at number 19.
[103:59.85]Now, Psychology 101 better not be a top seed again.
[104:08.26]No music.
[104:09.52]Get rid of him.
[104:10.78]Do it, psychology.
[104:11.84]Do it, Jeff.
[104:13.92]Do it.
[104:15.02]Yeah, no.
[104:20.72]Get rid of him.
[104:22.88]I don't want to hear this music ever again.
[104:26.48]Get rid of him, please.
[104:29.24]I can't do this shit anymore.
[104:39.09]And you didn't even see jermaMoon come in and get instantly fucking eliminated by the censor bar.
[104:45.98]Wait, what is Jeff from Psychology doing right now?
[104:48.88]Jeff from Psychology is walking the ropes in a Royal Rumble.
[104:53.02]Something that you should never do.
[104:54.22]Oh, please.
[105:00.98]And there goes the IQ.
[105:01.98]I didn't even know IQ came in.
[105:03.54]That's how worthless he is.
[105:04.52]Here comes OWO.
[105:08.07]Somebody fucking get rid of the stupid speakers!
[105:11.45]No, Coffee Cheetos Chicken, reverse this and throw him over, please!
[105:14.89]NO!
[105:16.03]Oh my god!
[105:18.79]Coffee Cheetos Chicken is now officially eliminated for good.
[105:28.32]He's so pumped up from the music!
[105:30.38]He can't stop!
[105:32.08]The censor bar's got him by the head though!
[105:35.02]Is it gonna happen?
[105:36.58]Is he gonna go?
[105:38.13]Is this the end of acid base forever?
[105:41.59]No.
[105:44.23]Fucking god damn it, man.
[105:47.73]Coffee Cheetos chicken is gone.
[105:48.97]Please.
[105:56.72]Big base.
[105:59.40]Ugh.
[106:03.60]Well, we do still have a planet in here.
[106:08.01]And Jacenzo Barra just got punched in the face and fell down.
[106:12.09]The music's too quiet.
[106:13.11]I don't want it to overpower the goddamn stream.
[106:16.19]Well, OWO.
[106:17.69]Here, here, here.
[106:18.25]By the way, guys, we're in the final 10.
[106:20.32]Minus 2 is in this rumble now.
[106:24.96]Minus 2 just made his way in.
[106:26.12]And there goes Jeff from Psychology.
[106:29.88]And there goes jermaMoon as well.
[106:31.89]Jermashort is still here.
[106:38.27]Well, you have Acidbase still pumping the music into the crowd.
[106:43.15]Still has not been eliminated.
[106:44.25]Jermashort, I think, has thrown over four or five people now.
[106:50.57]I believe there is one more planet.
[106:51.97]There's also the counting meme that still exists.
[106:57.35]Well, you know, I'm gonna keep the music playing because this is probably the last time you're gonna hear it.
[107:03.99]Jeff from Psychology is finally gone.
[107:06.91]Finally.
[107:09.45]Here comes Spore.
[107:10.47]Oh, great.
[107:11.63]That's not good.
[107:15.97]Spore is now in the ring.
[107:17.10]Nice belly into the knee by Jerma Short.
[107:24.32]Jerma Short's about to get thrown over by Spore.
[107:26.16]He's so tall.
[107:28.00]This is it for Short Jerma.
[107:30.22]Get rid of him.
[107:31.44]Don't let him win this.
[107:33.08]That's the number one meme that has to die for 2018.
[107:36.96]Please.
[107:40.55]Ugh.
[107:42.91]Can no one get rid of Short Jerma?
[107:46.07]I don't see what the problem is.
[107:48.99]And OWO does a big knee drop onto Acid Base.
[107:52.55]Could this be the end of Acid Base?
[107:56.94]He's really tired.
[107:57.88]This is it.
[108:01.15]Acid Base is going to be gone.
[108:03.19]jermaMars is coming in.
[108:06.21]There it is!
[108:08.39]He's gone.
[108:10.47]jermaMars, the final planet, is in the ring.
[108:12.99]And there goes Acid Base.
[108:15.72]Forever.
[108:18.30]Sayonara.
[108:21.94]jermaMars could win it.
[108:23.06]We're into the top 10 here, the last 10.
[108:26.54]Think of who has not been seen yet.
[108:30.94]There are quite a few.
[108:32.69]Plus one, I'm sorry, +2 and -2 are both going to be in the ring potentially here.
[108:40.05]Oh, what's that?
[108:40.95]Spore just got eliminated, but who's, who's this secret meme?
[108:44.79]You haven't seen this person all night.
[108:46.79]It's 342.
[108:49.94]342!
[108:50.18]And there goes the censor bar!
[108:52.74]342 coming in with a huge neck breaker!
[108:57.53]Could 342 clean it up right now and be the final meme?
[109:02.39]Coming in for short Jerma, censor bar gone!
[109:05.89]And why is he green?
[109:07.23]Well, that's because 342, that's the color in HTML code.
[109:11.50]It's 342, that's the color.
[109:13.12]What the fuck?
[109:13.74]I didn't know what the hell this guy was gonna be.
[109:16.04]How do you make a character out of a number?
[109:18.72]You can't.
[109:22.36]342 catches the leg and tosses Short Jerma aside like a bag of fucking bananas.
[109:26.80]Big right hand.
[109:29.76]342 is about to clean it up and be the final meme to make it into 2018.
[109:35.84]He's got Short Jerma by the skull.
[109:38.54]He's all pumped up.
[109:39.38]He's all jacked up.
[109:41.38]Will we see the end of Short Jerma?
[109:44.25]This is it.
[109:45.93]Toss him over.
[109:46.63]That's it.
[109:48.47]342 with the elimination on Short Jerma.
[109:52.88]+2 is now coming in at number 26.
[109:57.16]High probability.
[109:58.80]Very high probability that you will be able to do a +2 or a -2 in 2018.
[110:04.34]Not both.
[110:05.76]Only one.
[110:08.54]We've got three different characters, our numbers in the ring if you have lost count.
[110:17.18]As jermaMars... Get rid of that fucking stupid planet.
[110:22.71]Somebody, please.
[110:28.05]Please.
[110:28.77]-2.
[110:29.59]Here comes BaldCoin.
[110:31.41]Come on, BaldCoin.
[110:33.37]At number 27.
[110:35.57]BaldCoin might make it into 2018.
[110:38.43]He's one of the final three.
[110:41.49]No.
[110:42.49]No, don't get eliminated by 342.
[110:45.98]No, don't get eliminated by the worst meme in the fucking whole channel.
[110:50.20]No!
[110:51.04]Oh, thank God.
[110:53.42]No, don't do it.
[110:55.61]No, thank God.
[110:57.01]Oh, I would have been so mad.
[110:59.83]Come on, bald coin.
[111:03.44]I got another four or five references for that cryptocurrency.
[111:06.72]And here comes the counting meme at number 28.
[111:11.78]Somebody in this ring is going to make it.
[111:14.98]Whoa!
[111:17.32]342 eliminated by Bald Coin with a, he just whoops-a-daisied him over the top ropes, and there goes jermaMars!
[111:23.13]jermaMars is now gone!
[111:26.07]We only have two people remaining to come in.
[111:30.05]That's it.
[111:31.83]Somebody in here is gonna win.
[111:34.32]And it better be Bald Coin.
[111:35.42]342 is gone!
[111:39.46]Out!
[111:42.58]kaput who and there goes owo JermaCraft is number 29. +2 +2 is gone by bald coin bald coin -2 the counting meme and JermaCraft one more remains one more remains
[112:12.80]Maude Kyle has been revoked.
[112:15.94]It comes down to these five.
[112:21.02]Bald Coin.
[112:23.34]I believe is the favorite.
[112:25.40]But it could be the counting meme, and how angry would that make you all if after all this, after the hours of fucking work to make all these characters, if the throwaway shitty count to a hundred meme gets to stay for 2018.
[112:44.53]Here comes the final contestant of the evening.
[112:48.82]Nice powerbomb there.
[112:49.96]And the last one to round us out at five is the comb stream.
[112:56.76]Will we be able to see a comb stream in 2018?
[113:03.96]Here they are.
[113:05.86]Place your bets now.
[113:09.26]Place your bets now.
[113:12.56]-2.
[113:14.63]Hurricane Rana onto the comb stream.
[113:19.30]The counting meme.
[113:20.30]JermaCraft and Baldcoin.
[113:23.76]Baldcoin might have a little bit of an advantage here.
[113:25.96]Has him on the ropes.
[113:27.03]Very, very stunned and dazed.
[113:29.77]Two kicks.
[113:30.93]Three kicks.
[113:33.81]Look at that beautiful hair on the comb streamer, by the way.
[113:37.07]-2 is still full of despair and agony.
[113:41.09]He wants to win this.
[113:42.05]He wants to be able to tell Jerma how terrible his jokes are and how not funny he is.
[113:48.42]He's willing to do whatever it takes to win to be able to stay in 2018.
[113:51.46]And there goes the counting meme.
[113:54.65]Sweet chin music by -2.
[114:00.92]Down to four.
[114:07.01]Who will prevail?
[114:09.15]And the counting meme is so upset.
[114:10.51]All those people that like to count in the stream are so pissed off right now.
[114:13.68]They can't believe it.
[114:16.78]He's like, get a bald coin.
[114:18.50]I'll show you a real joke.
[114:21.62]Uh-oh.
[114:23.34]Uh-oh.
[114:24.86]Huge powerbomb by the bald coin.
[114:29.29]You can't fuck with that.
[114:30.31]He's worth at least like 60,000, Satoshi.
[114:31.69]No!
[114:34.88]Gets just handled and thrown over by JermaCraft.
[114:40.24]Comstream looks like he's in a little bit of trouble.
[114:43.68]No, just going into the corner there.
[114:47.52]Smashing his face into the mat is JermaCraft.
[114:52.20]Oh, is he going to help here?
[114:53.68]Going to try to get a double elimination here?
[114:59.16]Big wow.
[115:01.64]And there he goes!
[115:03.63]There goes the comb stream!
[115:05.80]The final three!
[115:06.98]Which meme will you still be able to do in 2018?
[115:09.96]-2, JermaCraft, a bald- Bald coin is on his last legs.
[115:15.47]-2!
[115:20.62]He fucking hates Jerma!
[115:23.00]Jerma's jokes are also fucking terrible!
[115:25.98]I'm gonna win this!
[115:27.62]To make sure I get to tell him every day!
[115:30.52]Fuck you Jerm- No!
[115:32.16]Jermacraft stays on for dear life!
[115:42.48]Oh no!
[115:44.04]He's gonna- Oh no, false coin!
[115:50.88]BaldCoin looks like he might be going into a crash.
[115:54.14]BaldCoin is dipping right now.
[115:57.65]He was worth $60,000, Satoshi.
[116:00.59]Now he's only worth like $41,000.
[116:01.67]I thought he was going to do a double elimination there.
[116:10.76]Bald coin's got -2.
[116:13.16]Oh my god, looks like we're going into an Elliot wave pattern.
[116:16.53]Nope, almost.
[116:18.59]Almost, almost an Elliot wave pattern.
[116:20.77]But not, not yet.
[116:29.36]Bald stop.
[116:31.28]Bald coin.
[116:32.54]TurboCraft has got him in a suplex.
[116:33.90]He can't quite finish it.
[116:36.02]Is he going to finish it or is -2 going to get out of this?
[116:39.69]No, he was just making a blood rush to his head.
[116:43.56]Hold, hold bald coin.
[116:45.26]Hold it.
[116:48.92]Uh-oh.
[116:50.32]JermaCraft.
[116:52.66]And -2.
[116:54.16]He's got him in a bad situation.
[116:57.98]What happened?
[116:58.34]Wait, what?
[117:10.71]He's just waiting.
[117:12.59]Waiting for BaldCoin to stand.
[117:15.65]JermaCraft!
[117:18.47]And here it is.
[117:20.92]The final two shit memes of 2017.
[117:26.30]Which one of them gets to continue?
[117:29.24]BaldCoin?
[117:29.78]No.
[117:30.14]Looks a little bit of trying to fake him out.
[117:31.82]JermaCraft.
[117:34.04]JermaCraft was waiting.
[117:35.84]Waiting for the reversal.
[117:36.87]He didn't want to expel any energy.
[117:39.30]JermaCraft has got Baldcoin now.
[117:42.38]Oh no, institutional investors have gotten involved.
[117:45.48]He's no longer decentralized.
[117:47.66]What's he going to do?
[117:50.56]Come on.
[117:51.68]Somebody get a whale involved.
[117:54.26]All the whales are asleep.
[117:56.43]They can't pump his price.
[117:59.93]It's 1 o'clock in the morning Eastern.
[118:03.25]Somebody sell it.
[118:04.31]Sell Baldcoin.
[118:05.27]Sell.
[118:07.13]No, wait a minute.
[118:09.01]What a reversal!
[118:11.25]Oh, no, wait a minute!
[118:11.91]The Korean market just woke up!
[118:14.03]That's it!
[118:15.23]That's it!
[118:16.55]Balls coin!
[118:18.23]Is your winner!
[118:27.21]That's it!
[118:29.42]Balls coin!
[118:31.12]Balls coin!
[118:33.10]Is the...
[118:42.38]Oh, God.
[118:50.49]Well, that was an upset.
[118:51.43]Uh, ladies and gentlemen, the only joke we are allowed to make from 2017 into the new year is bald coin.
[119:11.11]That sucks.
[119:12.89]That sucks, but it's funny at the same time.
[119:22.02]God damn it, man.
[119:22.94]There he is.
[119:29.86]You can tell he means business by how bald he is.
[119:32.49]Let me make it a little bigger.
[119:37.67]There you go.
[119:41.66]He's pointing to 2018.
[119:49.66]KFC.
[119:55.57]And with that, everybody, thank you so much for sticking around.
[120:00.13]That is going to conclude the Kill the Meme stream 2017.
[120:08.02]Don't worry, we'll be back here in 2018.
[120:10.85]Doing the same shit.
[120:13.47]Big wow.
[120:15.27]Did I say that?
[120:23.61]Big wow for 2005.
[120:25.07]I'm going to read bits.
[120:34.16]So if you just stuck around for this, thank you so much.

[130:36.82]I don't give a fuck.
[130:43.62]2017 is over, but, like, if you want to talk about, like... Like... If I gave a shit about money... And, like, trying to make as much money from you guys as possible... You would know.
[130:55.71]Like, it would be fucking easy to see.

[142:23.73]No, we may have created a few.
[142:30.25]What is this big wow thing?
[142:31.95]I'm going to watch this.
[142:32.71]What is this?
[142:34.51]I need to see what this is.

[143:20.93]So that's what it is.
[143:21.91]It's either somebody's dick or it's an owl.
[143:24.29]And there they are.

[143:32.07]Throw him out.
[143:33.62]Why is this Big Wow?
[143:35.16]This isn't Big Wow.
[143:36.08]Oh, there it is.

[147:35.10]Mod status has been revoked.

[148:05.24]Thanks for all the laughs and being something to look forward to every week.
[148:10.81]Coming into every stream makes me feel like I'm coming... Makes me feel like I'm among friends.
[148:16.83]Which is something I've been lacking lately, but hopefully will change soon.
[148:20.76]Well, you do have friends here.
[148:23.44]I would imagine the amount of people that are here on a weekly basis.
[148:29.18]We're all a bunch of like-minded weirdos.
[148:32.77]You know?
[148:35.09]That Discord has a lot of fucking people in it.
[148:37.45]People pop in there all the time.
[148:40.69]It's a great community.
[148:46.89]Sure, we got our extra weirdos, but...
[148:52.13]You are more than welcome.
[148:55.05]OWO will never die in our hearts.
[148:56.76]So, well, keep them there.

[149:07.48]Seagull, thanks for the 245.
[149:09.66]Jerma, I absolutely love everything you do.
[149:12.10]You've helped me through so much.
[149:13.16]Seriously, man, I can't express how much all these streams mean to me.
[149:16.72]Anyways, I hope your 2018 is an amazing one.
[149:19.88]And I can't wait to join you in these streams, buddy.
[149:21.63]Love you.
[149:23.87]Thank you so much for that.
[149:25.39]That's an incredibly fucking nice comment.
[149:29.01]Happy New Year to you.
[149:30.89]Hope 2018 is the year that shit just fucking goes off the rails for you.
[149:37.48]And not off the rails in a bad way, but just like it, everything just goes fucking right.
[149:41.48]All of you.
[149:42.78]I hope 2018 is the year where everything just fucking goes right.
[149:45.88]For all of us.
[149:48.32]Hope so.
[149:49.64]You guys are fucking amazing.
[149:54.16]Like, off the rails usually means, like, bad.
[149:55.96]But, like, we're going to backtrack here.
[149:57.26]Off the rails means, like, catastrophic.
[150:00.60]Different off the rails.
[150:01.24]You go off one roller coaster and you land.
[150:03.30]Your car flies off one and you land on a different track.
[150:06.35]And that's the Batman fucking ride of steel at Six Flags New England.
[150:09.31]You know what I'm saying?
[150:10.29]That's the ride you want to be on.
[150:13.99]Edgemont, thanks for the 50 bucks.
[150:17.49]Happy New Year.
[150:18.45]Oh, yeah.
[150:18.83]Forgot to say that.
[150:21.47]Mostly lost.
[150:22.13]Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[150:23.27]Jesus.
[150:25.45]How many $50 and $100 donations have there been?
[150:29.41]MostlyLost says, Happy New Year as well.
[150:31.69]Thank you both.
[150:33.92]Like, you talk about, like, 2017, man.
[150:35.78]Like, Edgemont, MostlyLost, like, Ben.
[150:41.66]Some of you dudes have given fucking thousands of dollars to this channel in the last year.
[150:48.16]Like, more than, like, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000, $6,000 to this fucking channel.
[150:53.35]It does not go unnoticed and I hope you know that.
[150:57.20]Thank you so much.
[150:59.74]Here's to 2018.
[151:02.58]All of you.
[151:07.31]Dens is a talented swordsman.
[151:09.07]That's not a meme.
[151:10.01]That's like a meme from like 2014.
[151:11.05]That's like a 2015 meme.
[151:13.53]That's not a real one.
[151:14.09]It's an old one.
[151:20.90]Like, sticks.
[151:21.74]Like, I mean, some of you fucking guys, seriously.
[151:26.24]Like, deserve, like, personal thanks.

[151:34.15]Able to let me do this and, like, all you guys that give money and, like, even watch.
[151:39.25]Even just watching.
[151:40.03]You don't even understand what it means.
[151:42.61]Maybe you do.
[151:43.31]I hope you do.
[151:47.83]I really hope you do.
[151:50.31]Honestly, God.
[151:53.13]Uh, we got a little bit more to go here.
[151:54.69]Uh, Clueless Sniper, thanks for the five bucks.
[151:57.65]I'm unsubbing from Metallics.
[152:00.08]Why?
[152:00.38]What?
[152:00.70]What did he do?
[152:02.40]Mostly Lost, again, thanks for the five dollars.
[152:04.46]Jeremy, you're worth every fucking penny we throw at you.
[152:07.28]I'm glad you think that.
[152:08.22]Uh, I just hope I can use it in the right places.
[152:13.91]Thanks, dude.

[152:36.91]Thank you, Judge Artium again for the $1.
[152:38.79]Al the Chemist, thanks for the $10.
[152:41.69]That was a great stream.
[152:42.47]It was the first one I watched.
[152:44.81]But it's not going to be my last.
[152:45.97]Happy Valentine's Day.
[152:47.02]Well, welcome, Al.
[152:49.30]Welcome to the family, Al.
[152:50.46]Thanks for the $10, first of all.
[152:53.34]I hope you enjoy your stay here.
[152:56.46]We're a little fucking weird, but... Hey, we smell a bit, but we got a heart of gold.
[153:00.58]You know what I'm saying?
[153:01.14]It's from Monty Python.
[153:01.98]It's a fucking great series.
[153:05.75]But welcome.

[153:20.95]Thank you.
[153:23.78]Mostly lost again with $10.
[153:25.78]Here's my pay-per-view fee, which I'm assuming I have to pay for the VOD.
[153:30.42]Love you, Jerma.
[153:31.04]Please never change and keep doing you.
[153:32.51]Thank you.
[153:32.87]Mostly lost again.
[153:35.01]Many times.
[153:37.15]No, VODs are... Just watch them.
[153:40.29]I don't put VODs behind subs.
[153:41.59]I don't put VODs behind money.
[153:42.77]Just fucking go watch them.
[153:44.15]They're there for two months.
[153:45.67]Watch them a hundred times.
[153:46.81]I hope you do.
[153:48.03]I hope you watch the shit out of them.
[153:51.24]If you get enjoyment from them, watch them.
[153:53.94]And download them.
[153:55.86]And share them with your friends.
[153:57.68]And tell them, hey, there's this guy.
[153:59.94]He's on this Twitch site.
[154:01.86]He fucking loves Snickers.
[154:04.04]And KFC.
[154:05.28]And WrestleMania.
[154:07.02]Watch him.
[154:07.44]He's fucking terrible.
[154:10.53]Thank you, MostLost, again.
[154:12.49]Jesus.
[154:14.37]I have to close.
[154:15.23]I'm going to close the fucking stream because of spoilers.
[154:19.21]LOL, fuck you.
[154:20.71]Wait, what?
[154:22.70]Don't look at this, get Paul's coin off.
[154:24.54]No, I didn't say a damn thing.
[154:28.34]Spoilers?
[154:28.88]There's no spoilers on the screen.
[154:29.96]There are spoilers on the screen.
[154:32.60]What am I thinking?
[154:35.00]What a dumbass.
[154:37.78]Oh, sorry, I spoiled the whole thing for you guys, if you're just joining us.
[154:42.11]Thank you, MostlyLost, though.
[154:43.65]VWYX again for two more dollars.
[154:47.87]I sent you two messages on YouTube.
[154:53.26]I don't think I've checked my YouTube messages in, like, four years.
[154:57.90]And guess what?
[154:58.50]Mostly lost again.
[155:01.28]Again mostly lost with another ten bucks.
[155:04.22]That's really inspirational, to be honest.
[155:05.80]Also, fuck Tinder.
[155:10.03]You'll find somebody, dude.
[155:11.33]Like, honestly, like, honest to God.
[155:14.41]I spent, like, two years, I told you.
[155:15.77]I was like, oh, I need a girlfriend.
[155:17.77]I need somebody that I'll tell love.
[155:20.13]Where are they?
[155:21.41]And then you just...
[155:22.62]Just do you.
[155:23.92]Live your life.
[155:24.40]You'll find them.
[155:26.48]Sometimes you find them in the places that you're just not looking.
[155:30.33]It's weird how that works.
[155:33.05]But thank you so much, dude.
[155:36.73]LaFerro, thanks for the one buck.
[155:38.65]Garfield lives.
[155:39.87]Garfield was never a meme.
[155:41.15]He's a shitty, terrible comic strip.
[155:45.51]I have nothing to do with him.
[155:47.93]Hobo Toaster, thanks for the $15.
[155:49.05]Hey, it's me again.
[155:52.13]Just wanted to let you know 2017 was pretty shitty towards the end and one of the only things bringing it back was your streams.
[155:58.35]Bringing it back up.
[155:59.81]Thanks for helping out over five to six years.
[156:03.44]Love you bunches.
[156:04.06]Big thanks, dad.
[156:07.44]Well, you're welcome.
[156:08.08]Much love to you, son.
[156:10.44]But in all seriousness, no.
[156:13.69]I'm sorry that something terrible was happening towards the end of the year.
[156:18.77]If I can be something that you look to to have fun and kind of have something to look forward to, then that means a fucking fuck ton.
[156:32.78]Swearing a lot, but still.
[156:38.04]That means more than anything I can even imagine.
[156:43.01]Thank you, hobo.
[156:45.11]I hope you stick around for a long time.
[156:48.52]Entry to thanks for the $2.
[156:50.70]When am I going to get merch?
[156:52.74]I got to figure that out.
[156:53.86]I don't know.
[156:55.00]2018 will be the year of merch.
[156:56.52]Maybe.
[156:56.76]I don't know.
[156:58.52]Convo Breaker.
[156:59.38]Thanks for the $1.

[157:06.53]One of our mods here.
[157:08.67]Happy New Year, Jerma.
[157:09.43]You're such a genuinely creative and funny guy.
[157:11.89]Thank you.
[157:14.49]Your community is fantastic, and even then, we don't deserve you.
[157:18.28]No, that's not true.
[157:20.74]Thank you so much for things that you do.
[157:22.14]You have helped so many people without even knowing it, including me.
[157:25.72]So excited to see what kind of wacky, stupid, crazy shit you come up with in 2018 that literally nobody else can.
[157:31.53]Love you, dude.
[157:34.75]That's not true.
[157:35.41]Like, you... You don't deserve me?
[157:37.83]What do you mean?
[157:39.31]What does that even... What do you mean, like, deserve?
[157:43.35]Just a guy fucking around on the internet.
[157:46.75]Like all of us are.
[157:48.83]Right?
[157:50.13]Just a guy or a girl fucking around online.
[157:54.57]And trying to have as much fun and make as many friends as possible.
[157:58.55]Right?
[158:00.03]That's it.
[158:02.86]Wow, I think I deserve him.
[158:08.90]But it's true!
[158:11.36]Don't ever feel undervalued in here.
[158:13.68]Like seriously, like people say this shit all the time.
[158:17.73]Oh my God, I love my audience.
[158:20.27]You're all so fucking wonderful.
[158:23.71]But listen, a large amount of you guys, like not even just a large amount of you guys, like since like 2015, this has been my job.
[158:39.16]streaming and like making videos and shit it's been like what I've done for money I should be fucking valuing you motherfuckers not the other way around like you guys have done so much for me as much as I fucking do you say I do for you it's such a it's so symbiotic in my office right in my quotes in my office
[159:06.09]Don't ever feel undervalued here.
[159:08.47]Because whether you give a dollar, a fucking hundred, five thousand dollars, or you don't at all, you just watch because you're having fun.
[159:16.12]That is all I fucking care about.
[159:19.56]Are you having a fucking good time?
[159:22.14]If you don't answer that question, yes.
[159:25.72]Then there's something wrong.
[159:30.71]That's all I care about.
[159:33.15]And I make a lot of fucking money doing this.
[159:36.57]Just look at tonight.
[159:38.51]I can't, like, pretend like I didn't make fucking, like, what, like, $1,000 tonight?
[159:43.78]That's a lot of fucking money.
[159:46.08]That's a lot of money.
[159:49.00]I hope it's worth it.
[159:49.90]And I'm gonna keep trying to make it as worth it as I can for you guys.
[159:54.91]As many times as possible.
[159:57.33]Real talk.
[160:04.32]Go home, Jeremy.
[160:05.12]You're drunk.
[160:07.85]It's a lot of fucking money.
[160:08.93]It is.
[160:09.17]Streamer tells viewers there is something wrong with them.
[160:18.03]No.
[160:19.30]Like, for instance, Storm of Shadow.
[160:21.76]Thanks for the hundred dollars.
[160:24.58]A hundred bucks.
[160:29.86]Happy New Year, Jeremiah.
[160:30.68]Always a laugh watching your streams.
[160:32.95]You never fail to entertain.
[160:34.25]Much love.
[160:35.05]Moon2Cute.
[160:38.19]Thank you for the hundred fucking dollars, dude.
[160:44.21]Thanks.
[160:46.65]I wish there was more I could say.
[160:48.65]I wish there was more I could say or do to show that you giving me $100 is a big deal.
[160:58.39]But all I can really say is thank you.
[161:03.88]Thank you, Purple, for the five bucks, too.
[161:05.54]Thank you, Jacket.
[161:06.20]Leather Jacket gave five bucks.

[161:11.92]Should I ban him?
[161:13.10]No, that's Grandfather Claus.
[161:16.60]He's been Grandfather Claus'd in.
[161:19.32]If you have a screen name that is one of these memes from 2017, you're Grandfathered in.
[161:25.23]You're fine.
[161:28.37]cyan TF2 thanks for the five bucks vwyx again thanks for three dollars good luck have fun sticks renegade thanks for the one dollar I have my donation back so I can invest in bald coin can I have it back uh no it's already been invested in bald coin under my account cyan TF2 thanks for the five bucks I had to buy more bits because I hit enter on accident
[161:53.87]I didn't get on the stream until the very end, but I'm sure it was great.
[161:57.10]Nobody makes me laugh more than you have for the past, like, six years I've been watching Keep It Up.
[162:02.94]Thank you so much, Cheyenne.
[162:07.06]Thivus, thanks for the five bucks.
[162:09.62]Thanks for the stream, Jerma.

[162:15.46]Alright, that's fucking, there we go.
[162:16.74]That's what I'm talking about.
[162:17.40]No more counting!
[162:18.28]I see counting in the chat.
[162:20.60]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[162:21.84]They can do that till Tuesday.
[162:23.62]They can do it on Tuesday.
[162:24.68]Tuesday's gonna be... So we killed the memes tonight.
[162:27.92]And Tuesday is... Let them run free.
[162:32.02]And then Thursday, they're all done.
[162:38.30]Uh, VWYX is giving more money here.
[162:41.66]Ten bucks now.
[162:43.82]Dude, you got a YouTube community even now.
[162:46.24]Even if all you do is check your messages, I'm sure you'll help some people.
[162:49.44]Don't even have to reply.
[162:52.99]The one... I'm gonna be real with you guys.
[162:54.57]I'm gonna be super real here.
[162:58.47]Like, Twitter messages and, like, DMs and emails and... Like, even chat messages, too, and even stuff like Twitch DMs and stuff.
[163:08.78]Sometimes I get a lot.
[163:10.50]And I... It always sucks knowing that... Because this channel has grown... At least... I think pretty substantially in the last year and a half.
[163:23.52]That sometimes, like, I don't, I hate, like, having to pass by people.
[163:30.32]And, like, oh, somebody wrote me, like, a message on, like, YouTube PMs, like, a year ago and I didn't see it.
[163:35.65]It's like, fuck me, man.
[163:37.89]Like, I, it's sometimes it can get a little too much for my brain.
[163:42.63]Like, did I really miss something that somebody was, like, so, wrote some message to me and I didn't see it?
[163:46.86]It sucks.
[163:47.22]It sucks.
[163:53.63]Just know that I don't want you to think that I'm just passing by your shit.
[164:01.01]Same thing with subs, too.
[164:01.91]I don't read subs anymore, but that doesn't mean I don't care about them.
[164:07.49]A lot of subs on this channel.
[164:09.77]I don't call out individual subs anymore, but... You know.
[164:15.02]Big wow.
[164:15.88]Big shit.
[164:19.20]Streamer confirms reading is too much for their brain.
[164:25.10]Come on.
[164:28.24]Streamer didn't reply.
[164:29.70]I'm out.
[164:31.45]No, no, don't leave.
[164:32.57]Stay.
[164:33.55]It's not even 2018 yet in California.
[164:38.05]It's 2018 in California in like a fucking hour.
[164:42.35]It's not even 2018 yet.
[164:43.25]Give me a break.
[164:48.00]Bye.
[164:50.22]Commander Pepper, don't leave.
[164:52.76]Don't leave.
[164:54.71]Now he's gone.
[164:56.81]Thank you Cheesy Nuggets!
[164:58.15]Cheese Nuggets for the $1.
[164:59.13]Thank you for the incredible stream much like every other one!
[165:01.69]Jeez, that's... That's a statement.
[165:04.57]You deserve each and every bit and dollar given to you.
[165:06.52]You're the only streamer wonderful enough I could ever say that 100% to.
[165:13.32]Damn.
[165:16.70]I hope you really believe that.
[165:17.76]I do.
[165:18.06]I hope that's true.
[165:20.61]I hope that you... It's hard to even explain.
[165:25.89]I can't even explain what that means when somebody says that.
[165:29.14]It's so hard to.
[165:31.88]When somebody, like... It's a thing about, like, trying to keep yourself, like, grounded, right?
[165:38.74]You've heard me read comments about, like, oh, thank you, Denis.
[165:41.50]Every single stream you do is incredible.
[165:42.93]You deserve every dollar you get.
[165:44.09]Like, hearing that is like...
[165:45.59]Oh, really?
[165:47.03]I'm the fucking best.
[165:48.33]Every stream I do is fantastic.
[165:50.01]Like, I'm so good, everybody loves me.
[165:52.47]Like, I don't... I don't want to get there.
[165:57.25]I love when you guys say this shit, because if you say it from the heart, then fucking fuck yeah.
[166:03.88]But don't let me get a head that's like too big for my shoulders.
[166:06.60]You know what I'm saying?
[166:10.06]Don't let this head inflate to like a balloon that you should just pop.
[166:17.17]I don't want an ego.
[166:18.05]I don't want to be one of those ego streamer YouTube dickheads.
[166:22.63]Don't let it happen.
[166:25.35]It's too late.
[166:28.71]Too late, you fucking egomaniac.
[166:36.62]Oh, my God.

[168:37.90]I don't see it back here.
[168:38.90]Maybe it got caught in the system.

[170:52.30]So I have a bunch of friends.
[170:53.86]Like, close friends.
[170:56.50]Uh, I think, uh, I think the last time I hung out with my best friend in real life, my best friend, uh, like four months ago, we spend most of our time together.
[171:10.99]Like I spend most of my time with this chap.
[171:13.53]You understand?
[171:13.91]Like, if you're talking about like a friendship situation here, like let's talk about friends.
[171:19.81]I have a couple of really close friends.
[171:21.31]I saw one like four days ago.
[171:25.10]For, like, an hour?
[171:27.80]We've been sitting here for, like, fucking four hours.
[171:29.32]I've spent four times as much time with you guys than my fucking friend.
[171:32.49]In real life.
[171:35.53]You guys are my goddamn friends, and I mean it.
[171:38.45]Broke it again.
[171:39.55]In half.
[171:43.67]This time, for real.
[171:45.67]This time, I ain't gonna fix that.
[171:47.04]This time, it's it.
[171:47.80]This time, I'm gonna have to call a fucking plumber.
[171:50.04]Okay.
[171:59.03]Thank you, everybody.
