[00:00.29]And for this special journey, you will need a pirate hat.
[00:04.72]Hi, Squash.
[00:06.08]Oh, hi.
[00:07.80]What are you playing as?
[00:09.44]I'm playing as... What are you playing as?
[00:11.62]Oh, I'll show you what I'm going to play as.
[00:12.67]I'm going to play Team Fortress 2 as the Pyromaniac.
[00:16.67]I'm going to be playing Team Fortress 2 as... The Pirate Spy!
[00:29.00]I got it from the party store.
[00:30.68]This looks like a dumpy party store hat.
[00:32.70]Oh, yeah, like my hat I got it from.
[00:34.58]Can we play the game?
[00:35.52]Alright, let's go.
[00:36.72]I'm going to distract him, and then you give him the backstab.
[00:40.49]You ready?
[00:40.77]Here we go.
[00:41.17]Nice job.
[00:41.85]Great distraction.
[00:42.85]You got him.
[00:44.39]Nice.
[00:44.81]Excellent.
[00:45.25]Teamwork, teamwork, teamwork.
[00:46.31]Watch out.
[00:48.11]I got killed.
[00:48.67]Teamwork, teamwork, teamwork.
[00:49.65]Damn it.
[00:51.47]I'm a pyro!
[00:53.17]I'm a pyro!
[00:54.57]I can play this game now!
[00:57.16]Finally, they added something that would let me allow to be playing.
[01:01.50]Finally, the Rock has come back to Ohio!
[01:06.01]Yeah!
[01:07.79]You're Rudy Poo Candia!
[01:10.67]And here comes the rock bottom- oh my god, there's an engie here.
[01:15.21]He doesn't- wait, he doesn't say that.
[01:16.77]He doesn't, like, announce the finishing move.
[01:18.41]Yeah, he does.
[01:18.97]No, he doesn't.
[01:19.63]He says, here comes the rock bottom, and he points to the crowd, like, where it's gonna go, like a grand slam.
[01:26.51]No.
[01:27.43]Rock, no, you can't do this, no.
[01:29.49]Wait, no, what does the referee have to do with this?
[01:31.37]He didn't do anything, you can't do this to two men while you're wearing underwear!
[01:36.94]in your underwear.
[01:38.96]Okay, where are you?
[01:44.55]I'm Pirate Pyro.
[01:48.65]Where are you going?
[01:49.97]Go away.
[01:50.85]Go away.
[01:52.07]We're clearly done playing the game, so just go away.
[01:53.85]Get over here.
[01:55.29]What are you doing?
[01:55.83]Let's go to the spot.
[01:56.53]I was just doing what you were doing.
[01:57.73]Why were you doing it?
[01:58.61]Go to the spot.
[01:59.49]Because you did it.
[02:00.37]You think because I did it, it's a good idea?
[02:03.01]No.
[02:03.31]Get behind this box.
[02:04.25]No.
[02:05.69]Why do these people keep coming here?
[02:07.09]I don't know.
[02:09.37]This is the dumbest non-plan I have ever come up with, and people are just turning this corner and making sure no one's at the trash.
[02:16.10]Mmm, cupcakes.
[02:18.22]Oh no, why?
[02:19.25]See?
[02:19.71]What?
[02:20.27]Who's checking this spot?
[02:22.45]I don't know, this guy apparently.
[02:34.96]Who does that?
[02:35.80]It's like he turned the corner like he had a wall hack on, like he just knew someone's guarding this trash and he's gotta stop him.
[02:42.00]Maybe that's like a- people use it just to hide.
[02:46.16]People use it?
[02:46.56]What are you talking about?
[02:47.20]People play Koth King?
[02:49.16]Why did a hat- why did your hat just come out of my face?
[02:54.47]What?
[02:57.03]What?
[03:09.41]You're supposed to be a pyro!
[03:12.23]I wanted to show you my hat.
[03:13.85]We don't look coordinated if you're not a pyro.
[03:16.25]So?
[03:17.64]Has this worked at all yet?
[03:18.84]Take out your melee weapon.
[03:22.82]Stop!
[03:23.76]What?
[03:24.26]This is important!
[03:26.02]We're supposed to stay here and stay quiet until this whole battle blows over.
[03:29.78]Is this gonna end?
[03:34.89]No.
[03:35.85]Yes, it is.
[03:37.65]When it ends, we'll still be alive.
[03:40.64]No one's going to check the trash.
[03:42.16]Oh, okay.
[03:42.84]Oh, I understand.
[03:44.00]Oh, I understand.
[03:44.92]Oh, I get it.
[03:46.60]No, I don't.
[03:47.46]No, I don't.
[03:50.14]Watch out.
[03:51.92]See, we're going to get more people.
[03:54.06]You just wait.
[03:54.48]You wait and see how many people are going to realize how right I am about this trash.
[03:57.26]I think we've confused this guy.
[03:58.53]Hang out.
[03:58.97]No, hang out with us.
[04:00.17]He's just like, you idiots.
[04:03.02]He's dead.
[04:04.20]He just died.
[04:07.07]Who's the idiot now?
[04:08.83]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[04:10.45]Hit him!
[04:10.87]Hit him!
[04:11.47]Hit him!
[04:11.71]He didn't know!
[04:13.65]Yeah, who's stupid now?
[04:16.78]Really, us.
[04:17.58]Because who would do this?
[04:19.84]Us.
[04:20.18]Uh, yeah, that's true.
[04:22.00]That spy is gonna come back here.
[04:24.40]I hope he does.
[04:31.62]I helped, see?
[04:32.24]I helped you.
[04:32.76]I hit that guy.
[04:35.12]What a bunch of corner creeps.
[04:37.04]I know, really.
[04:37.62]I don't think we have anything to worry about.
[04:40.16]Uh-oh.
[04:43.13]Oh!
[04:46.66]Alright, well, let's just see what happens.
[04:48.50]The first guy that comes out... Alright, here we go.
[04:50.41]Somebody found us.
[04:51.29]Take a look.
[04:52.49]This pyro just found us.
[04:55.35]I'm still... I... He had no mercy.
[05:01.33]He just held that down.
[05:03.57]You know, every time we've, like, died and someone has immediately decided that we deserve to die, it's been a pyro.
[05:10.52]Alright, this is the plan.
[05:11.48]This is how we play the game.
[05:13.08]Someone's gonna just fall on top of us.
[05:15.06]Here we go.
[05:16.72]I don't that one of that would have killed me oh my god he's just like he's just here are you kidding me he hit my friend what do you think is gonna happen wow he's not gonna be happy we're both dead when he comes out here no I think we're good I think we're good I don't think he uh he's gonna remember where we are I think we're pretty well hidden down here there is you I told you he was not gonna take that shit again
[05:44.66]It looks like I'm just eating a sandwich, but I am not letting you get away with this.
[05:48.00]That's a guarantee.
[05:49.02]You don't just come here and mess with people.
[05:50.75]That's not right.
[05:54.53]You dick.
[05:55.77]Take that!
[05:56.85]Shit!
[05:57.27]Now you're in trouble.
[05:58.09]No!
[06:01.55]Yes!
[06:03.71]No!
[06:04.55]No!
[06:04.95]Dude, what the... Oh, he gave up.
[06:07.91]He gave up when he killed... Why do we have a third person with us now?
[06:14.85]I just like ate all those bullets and died.
[06:18.14]Oh, he's gonna kill you with that That's not the sound two metal gloves make he's just like he's just being a creep No, no one's noticed it yet.
[06:36.29]Yeah, there we go.
[06:36.83]Oh
[06:38.23]Oh, the whole team has noticed that.
[06:39.93]No!
[06:40.45]No, don't do that!
[06:42.54]He's just building uber.
[06:43.60]He's just building uber.
[06:44.44]These guys are gonna turn around and just crit.
[06:50.16]We're gonna get critzed.
[06:52.53]Oh, look at this.
[06:53.39]Look at this.
[06:55.20]Don't!
[06:56.08]Don't!
[06:57.92]I gotta protect the high five.
[06:59.67]He'll understand.
[07:02.21]No!
[07:06.59]It's a pyro!
[07:07.97]Look it!
[07:09.47]He doesn't even know what he just did.
[07:11.23]Is this the pirate's ice cream truck?
[07:22.74]The worst part of this whole thing.
[07:27.57]I don't know if you realize, that's not a pirate song.
[07:30.31]That's like an American marching band song.
[07:33.69]It has nothing to do with pirates.
