[00:00.52]What up?
[00:01.68]Hey, what up?
[00:02.54]How you doing?
[00:05.30]I didn't even tweet that.
[00:08.66]Somebody mentioned that I need a Twitter update because apparently my last tweet is my dog is in the ER.
[00:21.77]It's been like that for like three weeks.
[00:23.15]And people that go to my last tweet, it just... I gotta have something here.
[00:30.79]They're like, dude, can you please just write fucking anything?
[00:32.82]And I'm like, I don't... I don't know what to write.
[00:41.16]Just tweet Pugface.
[00:42.49]No, but that's like... I can't.
[00:45.05]I can't do that.
[00:49.31]Anyways, I'll be right back.
[00:50.49]I'm going to tweet that.
[01:34.26]Alright.
[01:35.73]So today, we're going to be playing a game.
[01:39.93]This game is unlike some of the others we've played.
[01:43.67]And what I mean by that is this game was $250.
[01:46.13]It's the most expensive game I think I've ever bought.
[01:53.30]This has to be the most expensive game I own.
[01:57.56]And it is an old classic.
[02:01.00]You're going to love it.
[02:01.92]I guarantee it.
[02:04.26]Why not emulate it?
[02:04.95]Because I want it!
[02:07.99]I've been playing this shit and loving every second of it.
[02:10.33]I want a copy of it!
[02:14.94]I want to be able to say I'm one of the... 16,000 people that have a copy of Gachafors.
[02:20.36]What about Train Simulator?
[02:27.07]No, I- I- I- I- Did I- Do I own Train Simulator?
[02:31.45]I think I- I think I did.
[02:32.35]I think I bought it to do the Halloween thing?
[02:35.79]Let's see.
[02:36.87]Do I own Train Simulator?
[02:40.43]I think- Why do I have this weird memory of me just pain- painfully purchasing Train Simulator?
[02:46.49]Because I really- Yeah, I have it.
[02:47.69]Because I really wanted to make that joke.
[02:51.96]What do I have installed in Train Simulator?
[02:56.48]let's see DLC right okay properties uh where do I where do I find this gotcha four sounds lame you but I okay that's fine that's fine you you can have that mindset but I'm about to get you got you're about to have sushi for the first time
[03:22.15]I don't like that.
[03:22.83]It looks weird.
[03:23.45]I don't like that.
[03:23.99]I don't think I like that.
[03:25.77]And you get a spicy tuna in your mouth.
[03:27.67]And all of a sudden, now it's your favorite thing in the world.
[03:37.34]What?
[03:37.52]I don't like sushi?
[03:38.32]Well, then, I don't know.
[03:39.68]Then, I don't know.
[03:40.18]Maybe you won't like gacha for us, but I do.
[03:43.16]And there are no vetoes allowed tonight, because I'm going to relive my entire childhood.
[03:46.54]2003, how old was I?
[03:48.24]Uh...
[03:54.75]18?
[03:54.77]19?
[03:55.43]I was just a baby.
[04:02.34]What, 17 maybe?
[04:05.76]Well, let me relive my adolescence.
[04:07.76]How long are you adolescent for?
[04:10.85]A vessel thanks to the five community subs vessel.
[04:14.19]Go ahead and just get this started.
[04:15.39]Get this moved over here.
[04:18.33]There you go.
[04:18.69]Got you, Force.
[04:20.77]This game has atrocious voice acting to a point where I might mute it eventually because it's very, very, very annoying.
[04:34.20]It's a game where you collect robots and fight them.
[04:38.51]And this is a rare game, and everyone was like, holy shit, this game's so good.
[04:41.73]This game was so good that they've remade it.
[04:45.16]They've re-released it for GameCube.
[04:47.08]Like, recently.
[04:49.14]I think, like, within five to ten years.
[04:50.68]They actually, like, put it back in America.
[05:02.81]Back in 2012, yeah, in Japan only.
[05:05.09]No, I don't want you to see that because I'm one of the naysayers to see how this plays out.
[05:10.54]In 2012, they... Wow, that's fucking hilarious.
[05:13.24]I thought you were doing World of Warcraft tonight.
[05:16.22]Get out of here.
[05:21.90]Because of suckers that paid $250 for the game.
[05:28.16]Yeah, well, I'm one of those suckers, okay?
[05:31.26]Because I want to display this on the fucking Reddit shelf.
[05:40.50]That's fine.
[05:41.42]I want you all to remember.
[05:43.14]I want us to remember this.
[05:45.22]Because we've got some naysayers in the chat, and in like an hour, I can't wait to see their pogging, smiling faces.
[05:52.78]It's okay.
[05:54.96]It's okay.
[05:57.03]Here we go.
[05:58.31]This is Gotcha Force by Capcom.
[06:09.04]And it's animated at 12 FPS.
[06:21.48]That's the main character.
[06:22.66]Gotcha.
[06:34.74]Look, everybody gets their own gotcha bot thing.
[06:40.26]And there's backstabbing.
[06:42.50]There's deceit.
[06:45.98]There's action.
[06:55.68]The gotcha forces.
[06:56.99]And then there's aliens that you have to fight.
[06:58.91]And they're bad guys.
[06:59.87]You have to team up.
[07:00.65]We have to make a team.
[07:13.60]Digimon?
[07:14.14]It is not Digimon.
[07:18.05]These are not monsters.
[07:19.13]They're gacha forces, okay?
[07:22.11]It's different.
[07:22.83]It's a different entire series.
[07:27.00]Here we go.
[07:30.97]The day after a meteorite fell towards Safari Town.
[07:34.10]It's not even what that says.
[07:35.04]A boy went in search of it, hoping to find an adventure.
[07:42.94]What he found was a palm-sized robot that has a mind of its own.
[07:47.21]The little machine was also a life form known as a gacha board from the planet Megabor.
[07:51.47]I feel like this is how I went to a school play and this is a kid like reading the Bible.
[07:55.89]Like, oh, here's like the Bible school play.
[07:57.91]What?
[08:00.74]Did this small toy just talk?
[08:03.44]My name is G-Red.
[08:05.37]I am a gacha warg, and I've come to Earth to find and stop the evil army known as the Death Force.
[08:10.81]I need your courage to battle on this planet.
[08:14.67]Please lend me your power and become our GF commander.
[08:18.92]Alright, you ready?
[08:22.34]You ready to wake the fuck up?
[08:29.91]Let's go.
[08:32.21]They are the Death Force.
[08:33.37]That's right.
[08:36.85]They are an evil gacha board corpse that fight only to conquer and destroy.
[08:43.08]Your fighting courage turns into GF energy, which is my battle power.
[08:51.67]Hey.
[08:54.19]Hey.
[08:58.64]Thank you, Mick, for the five community subs.
[09:02.26]Appreciate it.
[09:06.14]Oh, don't worry.
[09:07.45]I was going to... We're going to have to shut up about 4,200 people saying like, Oh, I shouldn't have... Oh, I'm sorry.
[09:20.95]What was... Something wrong?
[09:28.96]Oh, I'm sorry.
[09:29.38]Was something wrong?
[09:37.85]You get... There are thousands of bots in this game that you can unlock and play with.
[09:42.21]You make a whole team.
[09:43.09]You make a bot team.
[09:45.01]And there are thousands of them.
[09:46.65]Thousands of them.
[09:51.16]65% chance to hit.
[09:54.62]You've done it, G-Red.
[09:55.54]Yeah, thanks to you.
[09:59.05]My home planet, called Megaborg, was destroyed by the Death Force.
[10:03.41]Now I must stop the Death Force from destroying this planet at any cost!
[10:07.57]If you're willing to fight alongside us, can you please tell me your name?
[10:11.36]Sure.
[10:11.62]Come on, what should it be?
[10:19.18]This game looks more janky than Monster Rancher?
[10:22.28]What, you think that's a bad thing?
[10:28.96]How about Redditor?
[10:31.22]Yeah, how about Redditor?
[10:32.48]That's a good one.
[10:35.53]Hey, Curve Bumble, thanks for the $100, 10,000 bits.
[10:36.99]100 bucks.
[10:43.55]Thank you so much.
[10:44.19]They say, Oh, there's no way.
[11:01.90]One important tip, never put anything in the 20th force loadout.
[11:05.76]It's missing levels.
[11:07.78]It's missing and there's levels of bugs and it's exploitable.
[11:11.95]Wait, what?
[11:12.39]Don't put anything in the 20th force loadout.
[11:14.85]What does that mean?
[11:16.23]I gotta remember that.
[11:21.22]Thanks for the fucking hundred bucks.
[11:23.06]Alright, how about teeth?
[11:28.58]How about, uh, Cruncher?
[11:31.42]Make his name Vito.
[11:33.18]Okay.
[11:39.13]That's fine.
[11:47.71]Thank you.
[11:48.21]Thank you, Vito.
[11:50.00]Nice to meet you, G-Red.
[11:51.28]It's an honor to battle with you.
[11:53.80]Let's join forces.
[11:54.98]We will protect you and your planet from the Death Force.
[11:59.42]We are the Gachaborg Corps of Justice, known as Gachaforce.
[12:07.48]This game is... I love this game.
[12:09.12]It's great.
[12:15.57]Here we go.
[12:18.12]We can choose where we want to go.
[12:21.02]We can go to the elementary school.
[12:22.92]We can go to our home.
[12:24.36]Or we can go to Hekeru's home.
[12:28.34]Let's open menu.
[12:30.18]Save the game here.
[12:33.54]It's an open playing field here.
[12:37.21]Let's just go to the elementary.
[12:38.61]We can't.
[12:39.49]Why not?
[12:41.37]Oh, we have to go here.
[12:44.01]Battle with Hekeru.
[12:48.92]I see Vito's Gachaborg is called G-Red.
[12:51.11]Well, why don't you have him fight against my Sasuke?
[12:55.47]Okay.
[13:04.88]Face your opponent.
[13:06.64]Get ready.
[13:07.62]Go!
[13:11.34]Yeah, I can fly too.
[13:13.34]And I can dash too.
[13:20.16]I only get five bullets.
[13:21.62]By the way, everything is upgradable.
[13:22.82]In case you didn't know.
[13:25.98]By the way, in case you didn't know, everything is upgradable.
[13:27.62]In case you didn't know.
[13:36.71]Well, that kid sucks.
[13:38.25]Ha ha ha ha ha.
[13:47.39]Yeah, the kid does suck.
[13:48.25]What do you want me to say?
[13:49.61]He's the tutorial vision.
[13:56.39]Sasuke and I will join your fight and become a part of the gacha force.
[13:59.88]That's right.
[14:00.28]We fucking assimilate things.
[14:02.94]Now we have Kakeru.
[14:06.16]I assume you're not very familiar with this town since you just transferred, right?
[14:09.58]Here we go.
[14:17.03]Okay, we need to go to Sunnyside Park or Mana's Home.
[14:20.57]Let's go to Sunnyside Park.
[14:22.09]Skip the lore, please.
[14:30.98]Battle with Kitsune.
[14:35.72]Are you strong enough to challenge my mighty Isaac?
[14:39.58]I think so.
[14:40.10]Don't skip this.
[14:42.90]No, I'm not gonna skip.
[14:45.12]We want lore.
[14:45.72]You're gonna get lore.
[14:51.06]You look strong.
[14:51.94]Enemy, 230.
[14:52.56]I'm fine.
[14:53.20]How the fuck did I just do that?
[14:59.77]What does X do?
[15:01.79]Oh shit, hold on.
[15:04.27]X is like a dash?
[15:08.02]Oh, if I hold the charge up it... Alright, that was pretty sick.
[15:15.85]So you hold up the whole time, you do a blast, then you can go bang, bang, bang, bang for the last four.
[15:25.20]I was trying to not get hit once.
[15:27.22]Get out of here.
[15:27.82]That kid sucks too.
[15:31.06]This is what happens when adults play basketball versus kids.
[15:50.02]Alright, save the game.
[15:56.90]You killed him.
[16:00.27]Wait until, what did I say?
[16:01.41]Wait until three hours from now.
[16:03.55]When he's screaming about how he's getting fucked.
[16:08.04]I think this game does get pretty hard.
[16:09.22]Remember, there are thousands of boxes.
[16:12.28]What you're seeing right now is just a simple Monopoly board.
[16:17.16]Save mana's partner now.
[16:23.12]Kakeru, Vito, please help us.
[16:25.92]Now is in trouble.
[16:28.31]Okay.
[16:32.89]It's three heroes.
[16:39.53]MANA!
[16:39.79]Was I supposed to say two?
[16:41.35]Oh yeah, I have to have two allies now.
[16:48.83]I think you can change who you're targeting too.
[16:55.20]Oh, I changed?
[16:55.58]Yeah, there we go.
[16:56.68]C button.
[17:03.61]I'm out of fucking ammo, dude.
[17:09.67]Yeah, this bullet travels.
[17:13.21]Where's my health?
[17:18.52]Alright, I'm going to go in for the kill.
[17:30.30]Bottom left?
[17:31.05]Alright, alright, alright.
[17:31.87]What's the top left then?
[17:32.85]I don't remember.
[17:38.59]Oh, this character sucks.
[17:39.55]I need to upgrade him.
[17:54.86]Here we go.
[17:55.66]No, you suck.
[17:57.14]This is the first time he's ever played this game.
[18:00.86]It's not.
[18:01.56]But, I mean, it's been... It's been like 16 years.
[18:05.53]So, I mean, I forget a lot of things.
[18:12.73]We're gonna unlock like the ship Defeat the death force unit Alright select your allies commander healer or damage healer Please help me Please help me
[18:40.87]Alright, I'm staying away.
[18:47.96]Let's get some... because they're gonna keep spawning.

[19:19.99]Come on, how did I miss a melee that close?
[19:24.37]Who's left?
[19:25.55]Oh, big guy.
[19:30.77]Eventually the whole screen gets filled with, it gets hard.
[19:34.62]But not every game has to be hard, okay?
[19:37.36]Not every game has to be fucking hard.
[19:44.28]I don't even understand what X does.
[19:46.22]Just dash?
[19:47.06]Okay.
[19:47.50]That's a huge fun game.
[19:54.68]Super delayed voice audio?
[19:56.18]Really?
[20:03.05]This game sucks.
[20:03.81]Where are the drugs?
[20:05.27]Hold on.
[20:07.60]Wait, wait, wait.

[20:21.42]Yep, okay.
[20:22.10]So I didn't do it.
[20:23.84]I didn't change it to... Okay, we're good.
[20:26.19]1, 2, 3, 4.
[20:27.85]Alright, we've got a team here.
[20:31.85]Defeat, Nikobe, and Kitsune.
[20:39.87]So you're Vito, huh?
[20:41.17]I don't like you.
[20:43.26]Kitsune.
[20:46.12]Let's teach this brat a lesson.
[20:53.17]I think I want DPS for this one.

[20:55.63]Help me out here.
[20:56.62]Help me choose.

[21:15.81]Skills?
[21:17.39]Always mana.
[21:18.15]Why?
[21:19.39]You're no match for me.
[21:21.25]I'm going to lose.
[21:23.69]If you oppose Katsumi, you'll regret it.
[21:26.89]Who do we focus first?
[21:30.33]Bruh, I'm getting some charge right off the bat.
[21:34.37]Alright, I don't want to go throw my ammo.
[21:38.63]Is there really a recharge button I can just press?
[21:41.80]Alright, she's getting beat up.
[21:50.36]Alright, just keep it busy.
[21:58.83]Ow!
[21:59.55]It hurts!
[22:00.29]He's hurting me!
[22:02.19]I'm sorry!
[22:02.69]Are you out?
[22:05.53]No.
[22:10.00]Did I get it?
[22:14.52]Alright, watch it.
[22:16.60]Back, back, back, back, back.
[22:17.38]The guy's like two swords.
[22:23.61]I'm going in.
[22:23.95]Okay.
[22:27.35]B Melee into X?
[22:31.05]Sounds pretty fucking cool.
[22:36.24]These are all mean kids?
[22:44.96]This game's fun.
[22:46.72]He pulled his punches on purpose.
[22:48.34]He isn't that right, Hatsumi.
[22:52.00]Yes, of course.
[22:52.64]I'll be serious next time.
[22:55.51]Got 800 GF energy.
[22:59.29]Seems your GF energy has increased.
[23:01.47]Vito, try assembling your force.
[23:03.23]You can edit your force with the X button.
[23:04.93]Oh, what's that?
[23:07.00]These are the gacha boards you have.
[23:12.88]Oh, what are they, a thousand?
[23:15.46]Recruit a gacha board from the gacha box to your force.
[23:23.41]We have Normal Ninja, Revolver Gunman.
[23:27.61]I have a limit of 800.
[23:28.81]So what are you worth?
[23:32.41]You're worth 300.
[23:33.15]So I've got 500 more.
[23:33.87]What are you worth?
[23:34.71]250?
[23:35.55]I think I can take both.
[23:38.71]150.
[23:39.95]Alright.
[23:41.89]We're good.
[23:45.91]Yeah, you can have... Somebody said don't put anything in the 20th slot?
[23:51.86]It fucks with everything?
[24:02.10]Is that better?
[24:03.84]Oh, do it.
[24:04.34]No balls.
[24:04.84]Why would I do that?
[24:06.52]Here's the warehouse list.
[24:09.32]I think you can buy them, too.
[24:13.72]That's fine.
[24:14.12]Alright, we'll confirm this.
[24:22.40]Can't buy them.
[24:22.90]Yeah, you get them from somewhere, though.
[24:24.36]Alright, here we go.
[24:26.77]Training with Kakeru.
[24:31.03]Look, I have a successful assembled my force.
[24:32.97]Why don't we have a test battle?
[24:36.77]Hmm.
[24:41.09]Number one, G Red Force.
[24:43.97]This is the one.

[33:06.77]As to why, what, why has every game not done this camera?
[33:10.84]What the fuck?

[33:58.68]Nice hit.
[34:06.76]We showed them.
[34:08.18]We all did it.

[34:12.96]I did it.
[34:15.75]You were there.
[34:23.81]Alright, we got some... Battle with Usagi and Tsutomu.
[34:34.54]I've never seen that gacha board.

[34:40.54]I don't think you can defeat my leopard.
[34:42.95]Oh, I forgot to save.
[34:50.47]Or even save it to the cloud.
[34:58.66]Okay.
[35:02.82]Let's do it.
[35:04.39]I feel like I want to bring... I'm bringing DPS.
[35:06.81]We're going to stay with this team.
[35:15.33]Usagi and Tsutomu.
[35:22.27]Alright, let's go.
[35:25.38]We've got to calm down.
[35:26.40]Holy shit, that looks like one of those Squidward people from Nintendo.
[35:29.26]What are they called?
[35:29.80]Focus fire!
[35:33.56]Ow, ow, ow!
[35:42.35]No way!
[35:42.55]You didn't even stand a chance.
[35:43.67]Was that your main hero?
[35:45.35]Too far!
[35:45.69]Do it!
[35:45.99]Get in there!
[35:51.18]Not yet!
[36:02.18]You gotta get close with this character.
[36:03.54]That's the problem.
[36:07.54]Quit bullying kids.
[36:09.56]I am a kid.
[36:11.16]What are you talking about?
[36:12.20]I am one of the kids.
[36:15.63]When he lands, you're in trouble.
[36:21.47]Oh, he's dead.
[36:22.79]Don't worry.
[36:23.61]I got the best character.
[36:28.59]Oh, shit.
[36:28.93]That was a lot of damage.
[36:35.87]Let me reload.
[36:44.07]You get the fuck in there and do something, man!
[36:51.78]There we go.
[36:52.64]Holy shit, I got a lot of damage.
[36:56.34]Why?
[36:56.62]Why is the double-barreled shotgun?
[37:00.28]Does it lose points?
[37:12.19]What's the point of this game?
[37:13.05]I don't think there is one.
[37:15.75]It's battle toys with your friends.
[37:17.80]Ooh, Usagi has joined you.
[37:26.52]I should join the gacha force too.
[37:27.92]Okay.
[37:36.19]Do I have enough for... No, I don't.
[37:38.83]Um... I don't... I kind of like this one.
[37:41.99]Okay, but... But I do want you first.
[37:44.92]I like being able to go... You're a last resort.
[37:49.88]I'll say this one.
[37:59.29]Battle with Tetsuya and Met.
[38:03.13]Hey!
[38:04.21]You got a gachaporg too, let's battle.
[38:06.83]Ha, you are a novice.
[38:07.87]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[38:14.22]Wait, the tank can be my friend?
[38:16.34]I'm picking tank.
[38:24.68]He only has one character, but it's tank.
[38:31.29]Looks like it's going to be difficult.
[38:34.79]Alright, tank, get in there.
[38:40.38]Right at the bell.
[38:40.86]Got him.
[38:47.26]Alright.
[38:48.66]That's homing, too.
[38:49.34]It's pretty good.
[38:52.59]Oh, shit.
[38:53.01]I didn't even know you were behind me.
[38:53.97]What the fuck?
[38:56.95]Help, help.
[38:58.43]Who's got me?
[38:59.21]Who's driving?
[38:59.59]What are you doing?
[39:01.84]Oh, it's this fucking thing.
[39:03.22]Oh, he's dead.
[39:05.25]Get me out of here!
[39:10.01]How the fuck do I get off this?
[39:12.89]He's got me!
[39:15.80]Alright, fine.
[39:16.24]I'm bringing in the fucking real guy.
[39:34.67]It's alright, I'm alright.
[39:37.75]Hank, you suck!
[39:39.49]Help!
[39:41.01]Do something!
[39:46.01]Kill him!
[39:52.18]Is he dead?
[39:52.92]Oh shit, it comes down to this guy.
[39:59.58]Where's Hank?
[40:09.11]Jesus What was it was even in the map He wasn't even in the map That was overkill There has to be a more efficient way
[40:40.13]Gachaforce, I hate them.
[40:41.33]That was fun.
[40:43.01]Let's do this again.
[40:43.61]Let me see if I can go in here and I can... Hold on.
[40:48.77]Oh, you can look at the specs?
[40:51.53]Oh, wow.
[40:52.19]It's like a card.
[40:53.02]It's like the back of a Marvel card.
[40:59.00]Shot, attack, and then shinobi bomb.
[41:03.12]This guy... Ooh.
[41:05.16]Oh.
[41:09.74]I'm going to try it.
[41:10.35]I'm going to try it.
[41:10.91]I'm going to try this one.
[41:15.07]Here to you.
[41:17.81]Put you in front.
[41:19.29]The best will last.
[41:20.17]150?
[41:21.73]Alright, let's go.
[41:22.95]I'm going to try the little ninja guy.
[41:28.20]Wait, I didn't even... Let me look at the other stuff.
[41:32.94]You have good defense, good shoot, good attack, good speed.
[41:39.32]Double recoil, fast shooting.
[41:42.76]Nice.
[41:45.36]Good shit.
[41:46.02]Well, that's not even as high as it goes either, guys.
[41:47.84]Alright, here we go.
[41:56.95]Oh, let's go... Stone River.
[42:02.13]Defeat these two.
[42:05.94]Go back and read the lore.
[42:06.98]Alright, well the tank sucks.
[42:09.60]I'll try Usagi.
[42:11.66]Save the game, you dunce.
[42:15.24]Don't call me a dunce.
[42:18.60]Ever again.
[42:20.37]But there'll be consequences.
[42:21.49]I'll say shh.
[42:27.17]Ooh, that's kind of cool.
[42:31.85]It's slow, though.
[42:32.63]That's really slow.
[42:33.23]What about the little bomb?
[42:39.49]That's not bad, actually.
[42:42.59]Alright, I'll focus on this dude here.
[42:55.92]Oh, get him all!
[42:56.74]Fuck, I'm so greedy.
[42:57.76]Why am I supposed to... Why am I like this?
[42:59.58]No, I'm... I don't know why.
[43:05.46]I don't know what I'm doing.
[43:06.20]I'm trying to...
[43:09.57]Come on.
[43:14.85]Explosion.
[43:16.11]Got it.
[43:23.04]I actually like this character.
[43:23.86]He moves around pretty quickly.
[43:24.66]How much health does he have?
[43:30.40]Alright, we'll focus on the guy with the swords because he's going to close the gap on me.
[43:33.84]But he ain't going to do that.
[43:38.53]There it is.
[43:40.04]I'm going to get in close.
[43:40.86]Let's try this melee move, huh?
[43:42.26]Ooh, that would have been pretty fucking cool, wouldn't it?
[43:48.64]He's got more than one character.
[43:56.79]I'm going in.
[44:02.17]Holy shit, I just did like a link pounce on his head.
[44:14.60]What the fuck was that?
[44:26.53]Holy shit, how did that happen?
[44:28.45]How did I do that?
[44:33.63]How do I know that's an indicator?
[44:34.73]How did I do that?
[44:43.58]Pop right?
[44:44.02]Oh, okay.
[44:44.42]It's a bad hit ratio, but it's alright.
[44:46.82]I'm going to jump around her.
[44:47.72]Holy shit.
[44:53.59]Read the manual.
[44:54.87]Funny what $250 buying this game buys you.
[44:56.87]Not the manual.
[44:58.50]Not that.
[45:07.28]I know, it wasn't fucking worth it.
[45:09.26]But yeah, it was.
[45:09.74]Of course it was.
[45:10.20]I'm gonna fucking polish this disk.
[45:12.12]And I'm gonna, like, tilt it and put it on a little display.
[45:15.74]It was worth it.
[45:18.20]It was worth it.
[45:18.62]Can you finish Fellowship of the Ring, please?
[45:28.86]No.
[45:33.00]Cooperate with Usagi to defeat the Gunborg unit.
[45:41.32]I'll keep it for now.
[45:42.38]Just buy any GameCube case and print out the cover to replace it.
[45:49.96]By the way, what the hell were those GameCube discs even called?
[45:56.49]Holy shit, I hit every single one.
[45:57.47]That was awesome.
[46:03.37]What were they called?
[46:04.19]Like little DVDs?
[46:05.75]That doesn't make any sense.
[46:06.57]How are they little DVDs?
[46:15.49]Get in here and do some slashing.
[46:23.25]ABDBDs?
[46:24.35]I don't think that's what they're called.
[46:34.54]ABDBDs?
[46:35.72]That's not... Everyone's saying disk.
[46:39.40]No, but they weren't regular discs.
[46:43.94]They weren't like regular CD-ROMs.
[46:45.94]Why were they so little?
[46:53.35]And... They were Nintendo A-B-D-B-Ds.
[47:08.45]How could I have not known?
[47:18.77]B-B-D-B-B-A-B-D-B-Ds.
[47:22.53]Imagine, like, making proprietary hardware and that's what you call it.
[47:36.68]I gotta get higher than 60% crit rating, whatever the hell that is.
[47:46.21]Unlockable.
[47:52.93]Ooh!
[47:54.89]I got two of these now.
[47:57.15]Oh yeah.
[47:58.29]Who needs anything else?
[48:04.84]They have different stats?
[48:05.64]This one's a D. Long range type.
[48:12.20]Fast shooting.
[48:13.04]No, he's just a D. I think it's the same thing.
[48:21.43]Let's just do rapid fire, guys.
[48:26.99]Please, lore.
[48:27.74]Alright, hold on, let me save.

[92:59.51]A lot of people don't have the patience to get the controls of Armored Core.
[93:12.04]They still make robot games that play almost like this.
[93:14.26]They're called Gundam Versus games.
[93:18.30]I just beat the shit out of these two.

[94:33.26]The red attackers go boom.
[94:38.80]I'm coming for you, Vito.
[94:39.98]Can you rename bots?
[94:45.79]I don't think you can.

[95:30.93]Go, yes, go, go.
[95:31.89]I want some bombers too.
[95:33.03]I want all these.
[95:42.24]These guys are too fast for me.
[95:43.28]These guys are going to have to die.
[95:44.72]Yeah, you're going to have to die.
[95:47.12]I need speed here.
[95:48.14]Well, that's great to have speed.
[95:49.94]Wait, can I pull you in?
[95:54.65]I'm gonna pull him in, you shoot him.
[95:58.32]Hit him!
[96:05.60]There we go, that worked.
[96:08.90]Teamwork!
[96:09.98]Alright, last dude, pull him in.
[96:24.22]What's this guy do?
[96:24.84]Is he gonna do anything else?
[96:28.23]Oh, he can't dash in the air.
[96:29.91]That sucks.
[96:44.17]But is this an almond dirt or is it a Wi-Fi?
[96:45.71]I don't know.
[96:46.91]This is good commentary.
[96:47.95]Alright, let me fix that.
[96:49.53]Whoa, look out!
[96:52.01]Watch, watch, watch, watch, watch, watch, watch!
[96:55.37]Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.
[96:55.95]Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it.
[96:56.91]Pull him in.
[96:59.73]Uh-oh.

[97:08.16]Stupid asshole.
[97:10.08]Get up.
[97:11.22]You're off the fucking team.
[97:15.28]Get there.
[97:21.86]Turn in your jersey.
[97:25.80]This guy sucks, too.
[97:33.40]Just kill me.
[97:34.06]I need to get... Alright.
[97:35.11]One of these will eventually hit you.
[97:41.59]Oh, no.
[97:43.23]This is going to be bad accuracy.
[97:50.63]Shoot him.
[97:51.14]How do you...
[97:55.16]Turn in your E-Jersey.
[98:07.95]I think we got a rare one.
[98:14.98]Oh, absolutely.
[98:15.66]We got a plane.
[98:17.18]Wait, what's that?
[98:18.30]Data Crystal N147.
[98:19.10]What's that?
[98:30.03]Collect two different types to form Red Attacker.
[98:36.05]Shit.
[98:36.61]I need to get two.
[98:41.95]Two different... Damn it.
[98:46.73]Delete your save.
[98:54.06]Is this pay to win?
[98:56.20]No, it's just... Well, I mean, that depends how you look at this.
[99:02.65]This costs to buy probably the same amount as like a two, three weeks worth of gems in an iPad game.
[99:11.05]So, I don't know.
[99:12.87]It's not what you think, but...
[99:21.60]it's the team sucks team we got to think about this team for a second here guys you gotta go I don't I don't I don't like them I'm gonna put them down here damn it okay that's fine
[99:51.07]This game is literally a gotcha pawn.
[99:56.11]Imagine paying $250 for data on a piece of plastic.
[100:01.50]Then nothing has value.
[100:17.37]Like Call of Duty Modern Warfare 4, whatever the hell it was.
[100:20.97]That came out.
[100:22.07]It was 60 bucks.
[100:23.15]That's a piece of plastic and that was new and you played it.
[100:26.67]Somebody did.
[100:27.15]Pass upon to waiting room.
[100:41.60]You'll get it.
[100:42.06]Don't worry.
[100:42.48]You'll get it soon.
[100:43.16]It's not even close to right now.
[100:57.48]We want it today.
[100:58.74]You can't have it today.
[101:03.68]This is what your mother made you today, okay?
[101:08.10]You can't have fucking... You can't have Wendy's right now.
[101:12.85]I made this.
[101:17.35]I get the fuck out of here.
[101:26.37]We want Wendy's.
[101:27.25]We want Wendy's.
[101:28.17]I want Wendy's.
[101:29.01]I want Wendy's.
[101:31.91]I want Wendy's.

[101:58.04]Alright, this guy's causing a problem.
[101:59.94]You gotta go.
[102:04.27]We want Wendy.
[102:05.15]I want Wendy.
[102:06.01]I want Wendy.
[102:09.69]No, you can't have Wendy's because Wendy's gives you gas.
[102:12.63]And I don't want to fucking put up with that right now.
[102:14.40]Don't die.
[102:23.06]Don't die.
[102:23.42]Watch out.
[102:23.66]Watch out.
[102:23.98]Where's my healer?
[102:25.16]Where the fuck's my healer?
[102:36.08]Healer!
[102:36.48]Alright, I need to go- I gotta- you gotta heal me.
[102:45.27]You're really fucking this whole thing up for me.
[102:47.81]Alright, heal!
[102:54.67]Where are you?
[102:55.07]Get over here!
[102:55.42]Stick me with that needle!
[102:58.22]What are you doing?
[103:02.80]Help!
[103:10.97]What are you doing?
[103:11.77]Gotta get that fucking shield down.
[103:18.69]Alright.
[103:20.19]That shield's gotta go.
[103:21.91]Right in the back.
[103:26.15]Stop.
[103:26.61]Do it.
[103:32.38]Are we really gonna let this guy with one health kill us?
[103:35.14]We're not going to let it.
[103:35.90]That's not gonna happen, right?
[103:50.11]That ain't gonna happen.
[103:58.51]A little too fast for you, sorry.
[104:07.50]You are the worst at gacha for us.
[104:11.64]No, thanks for nothing.
[104:19.18]It's a child's game.
[104:24.62]It's exhausting.
[104:28.14]I wanna go to Wendy's.
[104:29.14]I wanna go to Wendy's.
[104:30.18]I wanna go to Wendy's.
[104:31.16]Stop saying that because now you make me wanna go to Wendy's.
[104:33.45]I wanna go to Wendy's.
[104:35.31]What the fuck?
[104:50.37]Dude, it's pretending.
[104:51.63]Death Commander Orochi appears.
[104:53.79]Am I ready for this?
[105:00.82]My name is Orochi.
[105:01.84]I am the GF Commander of Death Force.
[105:04.80]What?
[105:06.14]Now you must fight me.
[105:06.86]I always wanted to be the Gacha Force GF Commander.
[105:10.16]This one says, tough stuff on it.
[105:11.82]Does that mean it's a hard one?
[105:18.63]You let me down last time, man.
[105:19.95]I'm not going to be you.
[105:22.91]We haven't used the Care Roof.
[105:27.77]I want to change this up.
[105:38.76]I know.
[105:39.02]Oh, he's the worst.
[105:39.66]He's the worst.
[105:40.16]But let's do you first.
[105:42.38]I like his.
[105:43.20]He's got a really powerful ranged ability.
[105:50.31]I like this better.
[105:50.93]Do you make this song?
[105:57.51]This looks like a game my dad plays on his iPad.
[106:01.06]Well, your dad's the man, okay?
[106:08.18]I am Orochi, the mighty commander of the Death Force.
[106:13.57]Okay.
[106:19.25]Let's play this smart.
[106:21.15]Don't go, don't go, don't go in so hard.
[106:31.60]What are you doing?
[106:33.12]You're just blowing this whole thing, man.
[106:46.66]Here we go.
[106:49.41]Now that was what I call a combo.
[106:52.98]Good.
[106:53.82]Watch it!
[106:59.78]Alright, sorry if I lose one, as long as he loses one too.

[117:37.18]Can I combine these two?
[117:39.24]Like a drill plane?
[117:43.91]You should go get a Baconator.
[117:46.21]And there's a gold one.
[117:48.67]It's a gold one.
[117:51.17]Oh, I think that's regular.
[117:54.88]You got a Gachaborg Megaton robot.
[118:06.28]Holy shit.
[118:06.88]Alright, let's take a look.
[118:09.26]So wait a minute.
[118:09.96]Let me... Data crystal.
[118:13.11]Collect two different types to form Reddit.
[118:15.75]Wait.
[118:20.63]Is that just a... It has to be the same one?
[118:24.47]Why are you guys saying Reddit?
[118:35.68]Hold on.
[118:39.12]Reddit, you said a Reddit attacker.
[118:41.22]Whatever.

[118:50.32]Machine gun.
[118:52.18]Megaton arm and then Megaton hammer.
[119:00.72]Oh, wait, I know the lore, the lore, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[119:05.20]This Gachaborg destroys everything in his path with his Megaton Hammer.
[119:09.59]However, he has to pick up the hammer after throwing it.
[119:12.21]Alright.
[119:24.06]Let's try that first and foremost here.
[119:25.32]I'm going to have to get rid of somebody.
[119:31.98]I want... Yeah, let's... That's too many.
[119:42.01]He's so expensive.
[119:44.01]I'll just try this for now.
[119:46.21]That's wrong.
[119:48.18]I'm wrong.
[119:50.26]Eat G red.

[120:18.00]Okay, here it is.
[120:21.73]Cooperate with Usagi to protect the marketplace.
[120:25.79]These ones are difficult.
[120:34.75]Alright, we're gonna try the bomb dude.
[120:36.11]The hammer dude.
[120:36.51]He's kind of taking up the whole screen.
[120:42.82]That's a major downside.
[120:51.46]My head's gone.
[120:54.02]Oh, you have to pick up... If you get hit, you have to pick the head up?
[121:02.45]How much damage does this do?
[121:09.36]I mean, it's pretty good.
[121:11.46]It's an instant kill, I think, for a lot of people.
[121:13.88]That's not bad either.
[121:14.80]Where did my head go?
[121:21.66]Where is it?
[121:22.88]Is it gone?

[126:55.24]I know a lot of people, like, really think the main character of the show is cool, but, like, I like the side character.
[126:58.74]I like to really click with this one.
[126:59.96]Not the main character.
[127:00.71]I'm not, like, the normal person.
[127:01.95]I like this character because it's a different character.

[129:04.35]It's good.
[129:04.83]I like it.
[129:05.99]Do I need to pretend like I've never had a Wendy's hamburger before on camera?
[129:15.73]Take out those sentries.
[129:23.41]What was that?
[129:24.19]Wait, like a vacuum cleaner?
[129:25.51]What was that thing?
[129:28.21]Oh, no, it was behind... oh.

[129:58.22]Or rise.
[129:59.44]There's no... You don't have to pay anything.

[130:36.55]We're good.
[130:42.91]Going for some melee attacks.
[130:45.70]Did I ever tell you guys that I thought the word was actually Melee until probably like 2008, 2007?
[131:04.75]I need 30 more GF energy and I can put another person in the party.
[131:12.82]Cooperate with Kitsune to protect the construction zone.

[131:30.78]I bet you could pronounce that.
[131:31.94]Yeah, I pronounce it Massamoon.
[131:34.73]I do.
[131:35.95]That's the Massamoon.
[131:45.61]My helmet.
[131:51.24]That's gone.
[131:59.52]Yeah, Massimo.
[132:00.28]Don't say Massimo.
[132:01.20]You're making me hungry for Chrono Trigger.
[132:02.76]Now I'm going to want to have it.
[132:05.60]You're making me hungry for, like, old RPGs.
[132:07.35]Okay.
[132:16.50]Alright, just throw the head.
[132:17.26]Pick it up.
[132:17.66]Pick it up.

[132:24.94]We killed him so fast. What a bunch of losers.
[132:33.94]You're sucking me in when you do that.
[132:43.00]Beautiful. That was just beautiful if you ask me.
[132:48.85]Too bad I didn't have this guy for the hard mission.
[132:51.64]It would have been so much better.
[132:52.72]I might have still lost, but it would have been closer.
[133:03.72]Go to Wendy's and order some Masamune.
[133:09.15]Introducing the Masamune hamburger.
[133:18.81]What the hell would even be on that?
[133:23.87]Blood?
[133:27.27]Alright, would you guys eat a hamburger from Wendy's if it was blood on it?
[133:42.88]But that was a part of it.
[133:48.35]no it was the it was the blood burger it was the Wendy's double blood burger alright what are you chicken the whole tagline was like don't be don't be a wuss but who's blood I don't know somebody's
[134:24.30]so human blood no you know come to think of it I wouldn't eat a hamburger that a human blood on it either I would be like no you can your commercial can call me I'm not gonna eat a human blood hamburger alright it was just a normal hamburger but there was like a teaspoon of human blood on the burger

[135:43.44]Oh, I waited for the perfect opportunity and it was perfect.
[136:03.25]what how did I not get you the bugs kind of suck you get a toy with blood burger remember the blood burger sounds like a fake wrestling move you'd say when Ronald McDonald kills somebody in the 2020 rumble
[136:30.57]Well, you're automatically assuming that Ronald McDonald is going to be in the next Rumble.
[136:36.70]I'm not sure that's the case.
[136:42.93]Here's the real battle right here, this dude.
[136:46.25]What do these things do?
[136:47.11]What is this, a dot?

[137:10.56]Four for four dollars.
[137:11.48]It's my five for five dollar fill-up box.
[137:13.48]What is that?
[137:13.82]KFC?

[137:22.63]Who has it?
[137:34.04]You're crossing over.
[137:35.00]He's being brainwashed.
[137:39.46]This dude's fucking wacko.
[137:50.77]Get out of my space, man.
[137:52.43]Have you guys noticed that this character is so good?
[137:55.84]We haven't seen another character in like 30 minutes.
[138:03.72]I feel like I got a fucking rare drop.
[138:09.90]Every fast food place has an X for X deal.
[138:24.35]Did Taco Bell just give away free tacos all day?
[138:29.17]Didn't that just happen?
[138:41.68]No, they did.
[138:46.48]I've been doing that for four weeks straight.
[138:51.90]Alright, let's go back to mana.
[139:01.70]Dude, you're a taco with no meat.
[139:03.50]Shut up.
[139:07.25]Is that implying that I'm all floppers or something?
[139:13.31]I'm all lettuce?
[139:14.63]I get no meat here?
[139:15.51]I'm all lettuce and tomato?
[139:18.28]So I'm just the gross shit that's on it?
[139:20.00]Alright.
[139:31.13]I love this character so much.
[139:32.13]He's so good.
[139:40.30]They're all tortilla.
[139:44.48]This is going to kind of be completely out of nowhere, but do you guys remember?
[139:47.09]A lot of you are probably too young to.
[139:50.30]Do you remember the commercial for, I think it was A&W Root Beer?
[139:54.38]I'm not sure why this popped in my head.
[139:57.86]The guy's at a job interview, and the dude's name at interviewing him is named Mr. Dumbass.
[140:07.15]And the whole time, he's just like, Hey, so, Dumbass, let me ask you a question, Dumbass.
[140:11.95]So, Mr. Dumbass, am I your man, Mr. Dumbass?
[140:16.76]And he leans in at the end of the commercial after saying nothing and goes...
[140:20.21]The name is Dumas.
[140:24.07]And then it goes like, oh, that's pretty thick, isn't it?
[140:25.85]Just like a frothy A&W root beer.
[140:29.05]I remember laughing my ass off at that commercial.
[140:33.56]He keeps calling him Dumbass.
[140:37.18]That's the whole commercial.
[140:38.06]He's like, oh, so Dumbass.
[140:39.92]I think I'm the one for this job, Dumbass.
[140:44.30]Name is Dumas.
[140:47.08]That's pretty thick-headed.
[140:49.42]Yes!
[140:49.86]Yeah, let's watch it.
[140:52.06]You got it?
[140:57.21]This is it, right?
[140:57.89]Okay, hold on.
[141:01.95]Oh, thank God, the links are back.
[141:05.21]Yeah, this is it.

[141:08.77]I can't wait.
[141:09.75]It's been so long.
[141:14.35]Don't watch it.
[141:14.89]Don't watch it.

[141:54.09]So, am I your man, Mr. Dumbass?
[141:59.23]The name is Dumas.
[142:03.25]That's pretty thick-headed.
[142:05.09]But nothing compared to the rich, thick, frosty mug taste of an A&W root beer.
[142:11.01]Mr. Dumbass.
[142:12.57]I can bring a lot to Dumbass and Dumbass.
[142:17.41]Dumbass and Dumbass.

[146:21.88]Flaw robot.
[146:22.52]Hmm.
[146:28.21]Check it out.
[146:40.02]It's high attack.
[146:45.43]Quaternary Missile?
[146:47.83]Iron Claw, Iron Spin.
[146:49.17]Hmm.
[146:51.62]A robot-type Gachiborg who was created to defend cities.
[146:54.86]Protects citizens from invaders with his hard metal claws and Quaternary Missile attacks.
[147:05.22]Where do you buy Germostox?
[147:06.50]You don't.
[147:06.82]You only sell them.
[147:19.09]I don't think I've ever seen anybody buy.
[147:25.61]Let's try clock.
[147:34.85]You're born with Jerma stocks?
[147:39.65]Alright, I gotta get the team together.
[147:48.60]right I don't know how many outstanding how many Jerma stocks exist in the world um
[148:09.28]I don't know.
[148:12.76]5,000?
[148:13.80]That's just the number of people that are here.
[148:15.40]That's the first number I thought of because I saw that's the first number I looked at.
[148:19.29]Holy shit, he shoots missiles.
[148:25.23]Ooh, that's cool.
[148:25.99]Alright, let's get in.
[148:28.09]Am I getting close?
[148:32.11]That's a good escape.
[148:32.78]What's his movement like anyways?
[148:34.74]Not bad.
[148:37.18]What the hell is with that camera angle?
[148:41.47]I'm assuming his melee damage is better than anything else.
[148:43.21]I guess it is.
[148:44.35]Yeah.
[148:50.90]It's low though.
[148:53.54]You can drop below 400.
[149:06.75]What?
[149:16.21]Well, that's just manipulation, though.
[149:18.11]It's not real.
[149:24.27]I'll call the fucking Jerma Exchange Commission on you guys.
[149:28.61]By the way, it's me.
[149:31.49]They're all going to jail.
[149:38.17]J-E-X.
[149:42.19]The Jerma Exchange Commission.
[149:47.81]Missiles are alright.
[149:48.65]They're kind of boring though.
[149:50.61]I mean, I guess if you could spam them like this, it works out pretty well.
[150:20.76]Crush teeth, quick.
[150:21.58]What?
[150:24.02]Is this the joke tracker?
[150:27.88]Wait, are you guys... Let me see this shit.
[150:30.14]What's going on here?
[150:30.80]Are you guys causing a problem?
[150:55.24]Did you guys know that there was a point where I was thinking about having an extension made for this channel to keep the +2 and -2 out of the chat?
[151:08.06]Can we talk about this?
[151:18.93]holy shit I just got destroyed and have it be something you could do but you couldn't just like spam it you know what I mean it was like it would be like actually like it'd be like an indicator and every once in a while we would just check on and see how it was but the reason why I didn't do it and this is the reason why I probably won't do it it's because um I don't
[151:42.89]we make jokes about like oh -2 and +2 that's like just I don't know if I want to have a like how bad is your stream today how not funny were you today oh no today was good but this one oh this is a real-time indicator this stream is I don't think this this stream sucks I don't think I want that information I don't think I would want that
[152:07.13]Because then it would just get in my head.
[152:09.25]And every day would just be like, let me check that joke indicator and see.
[152:13.03]What do we have?
[152:13.43]Plus 229.
[152:14.97]I can do better than that.
[152:16.09]I can do better than that.
[152:16.87]And then I have to start trying.
[152:18.73]Like, make jokes as hard as I can.
[152:20.55]And then that's going to make it worse.
[152:24.35]We just got a spinner girl.
[152:40.26]Okay.
[152:41.06]Yeah.
[152:42.00]I gotta play with Hatchet Knight.
[152:43.94]Best game on the GameCube.
[152:53.69]Very expensive, though.
[152:54.51]Let's see what we got.
[152:55.15]We got three jumps.
[152:59.65]You see.
[153:01.09]That's better.
[153:01.51]We have all Ds.
[153:04.07]Hatchet, Hatchet, Boomerang, and Rolling Hatchet.
[153:09.90]I was on a game show playing this and won.
[153:14.32]What?
[153:17.52]This Gajaborg is warrior in the Nightborg Corps.
[153:21.34]He can hurl his large hatchet at enemies.
[153:23.14]Are you serious?
[153:25.80]Who was that?
[153:32.81]Is it one guy?
[153:33.41]I mean, yeah, that's a pretty important one guy, I think.
[153:37.67]Video and arcade?
[153:39.88]Hold on.
[153:42.58]Is this real?
[153:45.86]This is like a real thing.
[153:50.93]Wait.
[153:54.85]Who was that?
[153:56.51]Who was that person?
[154:03.05]Can we... I didn't... It went by fast.
[154:12.86]That's fucking awesome.
[154:13.82]I just want to remember who that was.
[154:25.28]It was a trick.
[154:27.11]That's so awesome.
[154:31.53]What are we talking about?
[154:32.37]Somebody in chat played this in a game show and won.
[154:35.23]That's fucking incredible.
[154:45.75]I don't think that's a Jebait.
[154:47.73]That's a really weird Jebait in my opinion.
[154:56.79]Here's a spinner girl.
[155:04.99]Super beam yo-yo and super beam yo-yo throw.
[155:12.32]It's the biggest one guy ever.
[155:17.90]An outlaw from the planet Megaborg, she is also known as the Red-Haired Demon.
[155:23.07]Those who cross her will regret it.
[155:26.75]What's happening?
[155:29.27]Okay, I'm going to take out these two big guys.
[155:31.21]I'm going to do Act Guy.
[155:35.76]And... Uh, yeah.
[155:45.78]Uhhh... You're expensive, let's see if you're worth it.
[155:50.71]I won a raffle once and got cool socks.
[156:09.78]hold on I gotta get over here alright so I have let me try the night the big trouble night guy I was in a raffle and I won a PlayStation 2. that's pretty good too I was in a raffle one time and won the logical journey of the zumbinis real story it was my little league raffle I believe
[156:38.25]Alright, I gotta get close to this dude.
[156:40.39]Nice that he went the right way.
[156:41.69]Can I throw the axe?
[156:50.30]Oh, you have to charge it to throw it.
[156:52.30]How far does it go?
[156:52.94]That's pretty far actually.
[156:56.80]Wait, it stays out?
[157:07.75]His speed is so bad though.
[157:15.56]Melee is good in this game, but not really.
[157:17.42]I'll be honest.
[157:24.83]You gotta get in close.
[157:25.85]People can move around so far.
[157:35.82]I think this guy's too expensive for how kind of shitty he is.
[157:54.56]I mean, it stays out.
[157:56.44]That's good.
[157:57.86]That's the one decent thing is it actually keeps spinning around.
[158:11.89]Ask our gacha force expert if they're any good.
[158:15.25]I'm sure they probably were unbeatable at one point.
[158:19.04]Good for big groups.
[158:19.82]It's a long time to charge.
[158:24.68]It's alright.
[158:26.62]Can you turn the right way, please?
[158:38.19]Alright, let's see Speed Girl.
[158:44.63]Wow, that's super short range, huh?
[158:45.89]Does she even have any range?
[158:52.42]Wow, wait.
[158:53.00]Hold on a minute.
[159:02.81]Um, I mean...
[159:10.73]I'm not feeling it.
[159:13.13]Can I hold it out there?
[159:22.40]What about a good combo?
[159:35.07]Actually, it's not that bad.
[159:36.13]You can just fly around and get this out.
[159:39.47]That's pretty good damage.
[159:44.02]I haven't really been able to do much else.
[159:45.44]Wait, did that just do a lot?
[159:50.90]Still thinking about KFC.
[159:53.80]Yes, I am.
[159:57.10]Of course I am.
[159:57.74]I'm thinking about how they keep changing the colonel's voice every three fucking months.
[160:02.60]Did I do that?
[160:18.03]And let's activate the VAT system.
[160:20.47]I don't even know what the fuck is going on.
[160:28.82]But I missed.
[160:41.52]Actually, I'm going to lose.
[160:46.61]Alright, stop playing around.
[160:57.34]That's a new enemy.
[160:58.16]He's got a lot of health.
[161:02.60]Alright, get rid of the... Make that guy the last thing.
[161:04.82]Oh, it's two of them.
[161:08.00]Get rid of this dude.
[161:14.57]Oh, by the way, he's got an extra shot in his blaster cannon thing now.
[161:18.39]That's cool.
[161:26.54]Alright, we're gonna stay range on this.
[161:27.86]Ow.
[161:28.12]It's grounded.
[161:36.13]There it is.
[161:44.33]Ooh!
[161:44.49]Yeah, I'm getting away from this ship now.
[161:53.05]You're dead.
[161:58.80]Did I die?
[161:59.44]Oh.
[162:05.16]You can charge instantly in the super mode.
[162:11.90]Really?
[162:12.16]That's cool.
[162:13.72]Didn't even realize that.
[162:14.48]Data crystal.
[162:26.86]Give me something else.
[162:28.76]Yes.
[162:32.58]I've ever played Custom Robo.
[162:33.98]I own it.
[162:35.44]It is on the shelf behind me.
[162:36.32]We will play it eventually.
[162:37.78]This is one of those turrets.
[162:40.60]Alright, we're almost clear with this.
[162:52.36]Alright, you... You gotta go.
[162:55.32]You're down in the... You're down in junk tier.
[162:58.43]Okay, here we go.
[162:59.25]Somewhere in A, I think.
[163:03.55]Yeah, D. I can do this by tier.
[163:10.30]Okay, S tier.
[163:11.54]S tier, S tier.
[163:12.24]Who's S tier?
[163:12.70]Okay, where would I put you?
[163:19.64]I'll put you in A. I'll put you in B.
[163:25.64]Okay, this is... I think you're down here.
[163:28.00]Okay.
[163:32.80]This is pretty... I think this is... Yeah.
[163:34.78]That's correct.
[163:35.41]So now that I know where people stand, what do I want to use?
[163:39.53]25 and... What's this one?
[163:51.13]I like these guys.
[163:51.79]I don't think they're terrible.
[163:52.69]People are like, don't fucking play with this guy.
[163:54.09]He sucks.
[163:54.49]But I know him.
[163:57.40]Bomb guy.
[163:59.97]Let's hold on to bomb guy because I want bomb guy to be in case it goes wrong.
[164:05.65]What do I have?
[164:08.86]220?
[164:08.88]250?
[164:08.90]All these guys are too expensive.
[164:13.02]I could do a...
[164:28.89]I like it.
[164:36.53]The music's driving me crazy.
[164:38.89]Yeah, it is fucking annoying, isn't it?
[164:41.09]Yeah, I know.
[164:47.48]I know.
[164:47.92]I can turn it down.
[164:48.92]Want to turn it down?
[164:53.28]Training.
[164:56.98]Yeah.
[164:59.19]It's good, but there's a lot of it.
[165:03.89]Thankfully, it only happens sometimes.
[165:05.13]Alright, who do I want as a teammate?
[165:08.95]It's a good start.
[165:30.39]Wendy's OST.
[165:35.25]I love how positive Anna is.
[165:45.58]The mirror, it's a mirror.
[165:46.96]Excuse me, bye bye.
[165:58.72]Ooh, you're different.
[166:00.25]You can fly.
[166:17.73]I can't tell if these are ever hitting.
[166:19.19]I feel like I should be doing that when they're closer.
[166:22.41]Or something.
[166:23.33]I don't know.
[166:23.75]I'm just making stuff up so you think I know what I'm doing.
[166:32.66]The OST is good.
[166:33.64]It's good.
[166:35.42]It's catchy.
[166:35.80]I don't even know who that character was that just died.
[166:43.26]Wow.
[166:43.48]This is like the ultimate trade.
[166:46.58]This is my starter shit character.
[166:48.14]I can't even get by it.
[166:49.37]It's kind of embarrassing.
[166:51.21]I know we're all kids here, but come on.
[166:55.01]Grow up.
[167:02.56]oh they activated wait a minute everybody in the chat putting in all capitals just relax is referencing the people talking in the game oh I was I thought people thought I was going crazy like dude fucking relax I've addressed it like three or four times
[167:36.45]I thought people thought I was, like, too, like, wound up or something.
[167:40.05]Like, dude, just relax.
[167:41.23]Can I stop, like, pressing buttons as fast?
[167:52.70]Oh, he's dead.
[167:53.26]It's alright.
[167:56.00]You got fucking Sniper Girl.
[168:03.07]Wait, why is your Sniper Girl different than my Sniper Girl?
[168:06.65]Holy shit, that's why.
[168:07.81]It's a premium skin.
[168:20.53]There's another premium skin.
[168:27.35]What the fuck?
[168:32.14]Let's just spam rockets.
[168:39.92]Point blank rocket, get the fuck out of here.
[168:47.28]Yay!
[168:47.98]Come on!
[169:04.32]Something cool.
[169:06.14]A premium skin.
[169:09.38]Premium skin.
[169:10.72]No, that's just a regular ninja.
[169:14.66]That's sad.
[169:18.33]Ah, another chance.
[169:30.56]Damn it.
[169:32.12]I feel that's disappointing.
[169:36.29]Two commons.
[169:42.51]Well, I guess the good news is I could have two sniper drills.
[169:50.42]No, I can't.
[169:50.94]Not yet.
[169:57.42]Is this 250?
[169:58.50]Yes.
[170:00.02]Yeah, I can.
[170:00.34]Alright.
[170:01.00]Yeah.
[170:01.76]Look at that.
[170:03.14]That's a screenshot right there.
[170:04.14]1180.
[170:04.18]Perfect.
[170:14.86]Do I like cheese?
[170:17.44]Who doesn't like cheese?
[170:20.64]That was the VPN.
[170:22.18]The VPN crap.
[170:25.45]I know.
[170:25.79]I know.
[170:28.35]Look, that's the way it is.
[170:34.25]You guys hear me?
[170:36.95]Wait, did you guys hear what I said?
[170:39.39]Anybody hear what I said?
[170:45.45]Okay, let's talk about it now.
[170:47.43]That was my fault.
[170:48.66]And I know people are gonna... I know you're gonna give a shit for this.
[170:51.08]I know you are.
[170:52.67]Okay, I know.
[170:53.47]Just listen.
[170:53.81]Um...
[170:56.92]That was my VPN.
[170:58.00]The VPN crashed.
[170:59.58]Okay.
[171:00.00]I can't believe he said the VPN.
[171:01.36]What is he stupid?
[171:01.96]I know.
[171:02.38]Look.
[171:02.54]I know.
[171:03.68]That was the VPN.
[171:04.52]Okay.
[171:05.60]Cool.
[171:07.28]It's okay.
[171:08.24]Everyone can rejoice that nothing's wrong.
[171:11.58]It was the VPN and whatever.
[171:14.53]And why is he on the VPN?
[171:15.59]Because I am.
[171:16.71]And I can deal with it.
[171:19.17]No.
[171:19.67]Whatever.
[171:20.43]Alright.
[171:22.31]So.
[171:23.57]Close this.
[171:25.03]Let's get back to it.
[171:25.71]That was cool.
[171:32.51]Oh, it's about cheese.
[171:33.31]Right, okay.
[171:33.83]Rant about cheese.
[171:38.86]My voice is fucked up?
[171:43.26]Hello, hello.
[171:44.06]Hello?
[171:52.92]What?
[171:53.12]Is it good now?
[171:53.80]Are we good?
[171:58.01]Hello?
[172:06.77]Oh, okay.
[172:07.11]We're good.
[172:07.51]Alright.
[172:08.68]Why does he sound like this?
[172:09.98]It's just... It's a Twitch bug.
[172:12.68]I think the viewers are a Twitch bug, too.
[172:14.40]I don't know.
[172:15.24]Maybe it was a Twitch thing.
[172:16.58]Was it?
[172:19.54]I'm so confused.
[172:20.30]It looks like my VPN had a problem.
[172:23.01]Alright, let's just play.
[172:24.99]We're good.
[172:28.41]Wasn't Twitch having problems earlier today, too?
[172:32.99]Or am I just trying to deflect away from the VPN crashing?
[172:38.70]Oh, whatever.
[172:39.68]Let's go.
[172:48.58]What about the mac and cheese?
[172:49.44]No, it wasn't mac and cheese.
[172:51.80]It had nothing to do with mac and cheese.
[172:58.82]I said everybody loves cheese.
[173:01.56]The problem with cheese is cheese is not the best thing for you.
[173:06.27]If you eat too much cheese, it can weigh you down.
[173:08.51]If you have lactose issues, everybody loves cheese.
[173:12.49]You just got to try to limit how much you can.
[173:16.60]A lot of people can't really have it.
[173:31.18]I fucking hate cheese.
[173:38.06]I mean, that's alright.
[173:39.68]Some people just don't like milk.
[173:41.36]That's okay.
[173:41.84]If you don't like milk, you don't like dairy.
[173:44.28]You don't think milk is gross.
[173:45.82]Whatever.
[173:46.12]That's for you.
[173:47.10]That's on you.
[173:51.28]I would say a majority of people like the taste of cheese.
[173:56.64]But you don't have to like it.
[173:59.20]Like a requirement.
[174:15.55]Bam.
[174:25.60]No one can stop me.
[174:27.44]This music is going to give me a panic.
[174:36.21]I can turn the music down.
[174:39.13]This game is actually a great game from 2003.
[174:41.69]You can do, you can, just like settings.
[174:48.64]Alright, I got another sniper girl.
[174:51.72]You didn't think I had two?
[174:52.76]What are you, dumb?

[181:25.31]It came out of fucking nowhere.
[181:28.69]I can't do it louder.

[186:11.23]Anchors are fucking ridiculous.
[186:12.79]Hold on.
[186:13.09]Why is it still playing in the background?
[186:15.38]Oh, you know, I think she might actually be hurt.
[186:32.94]And again, I don't have anything being captured, and there's just stuff playing in the background.
[186:38.20]I don't even know where this comes from.
[186:39.06]Okay.
[186:48.54]I got it.
[186:49.24]I found it.

[188:25.18]On accident.
[188:26.52]And that's the first thing all of you spam when you're allowed to post links again.
[188:31.22]I think I have some idea of maybe what potentially that could be.
[188:37.82]I mean, you did.
[188:40.84]So like 20 years from now,
[188:45.19]Somebody's going to link me the slap.
[188:50.31]Have you seen this video of this guy slapping himself?
[188:53.10]And he goes... Some streamer's going to do an impression of it.
[189:00.32]Some streamer's going to be like, look at me, slap.
[189:02.60]And everyone's going to go, holy shit, that was a pretty good impression of that guy that's fucking ancient now.

[190:07.16]Alright, how's, how do you play with this guy?

[198:00.14]A lot of people on this team.
[198:08.40]Play Kingdom Rush Origins now over $1,500.
[198:10.56]For a second, I thought you said $1,500.
[198:14.41]And I was about to be like, you're going to pay me $1,500 to play.
[198:19.13]You said $1,500 downloads.
[198:20.73]I was like, I was going to tell you, but I wouldn't do it for $1,500.
[198:25.89]Oh.
[198:28.13]I'm serious.
[198:29.31]I would not play that game for $1,500.
[198:30.95]I don't even think I would do it for $15,000.
[198:34.64]I'm so lazy right now.
[198:35.12]I have to go get my iPad and shit.
[198:36.04]No.
[198:51.11]Wow.
[198:51.71]I have to go get my iPad for $15,000.

[199:52.81]Turn that poop into gold.
[200:02.70]I'm going to lose if I'm not careful.
[200:04.22]I got to pay attention.
[200:08.00]Would I do it for $5,000?
[200:08.64]I don't want to play that game.
[200:12.40]I don't.
[200:13.70]This is weird.
[200:15.88]No, I don't think I would.
[200:16.82]I don't think I'd want to.
[200:18.83]If I lose here, I'm sober, by the way.
[200:20.57]So, come on.
[200:37.73]Oh, you motherfucker!
[200:38.55]You're almost dead!
[200:39.35]Back up!
[200:43.30]One more.
[200:44.60]Don't blow it here.
[200:45.22]Don't blow it, don't blow it, don't blow it, don't blow it.
[200:46.62]We're good.
[200:49.80]I don't even know what the game was.
[200:53.78]kingdom um kingdom rush kingdom come rush kingdoms of alamor what kingdom come rush what is it called hmm
[201:18.20]A-Amalor, not Alamor.
[201:21.83]Kingdoms of Amalor.
[201:23.63]Kingdoms of Ala-Alamor.
[201:25.37]Alright, what's that thing?
[201:31.96]Amalor is based as fuck.
[201:33.64]You know, actually, I wanted to play that.
[201:36.91]What'd I just get?
[201:37.43]A capsule?
[201:51.43]What was it?
[201:51.85]It was a data crystal.
[201:56.19]Killer girl.
[202:22.73]Watch out, Demon Samurai.
[202:26.23]I'd rather have support.
[202:27.07]I'm honest.
[202:28.15]This game looks cool.
[202:33.07]It is.
[202:36.53]It's very cool.
[202:43.61]Oh, babe.
[202:47.05]They do a lot of damage, don't they?
[202:51.44]This guy's hiding back here.
[202:55.24]Melee versus melee.
[202:56.14]Let's go.
[202:56.45]Oh my god, this guy is getting stomped.
[203:10.69]Don't you feel like if your swords were that big, it would be a huge problem?
[203:21.47]It would just scrape all over the ground and shit.
[203:29.63]What is going on with these swords?
[203:31.95]Why are they doing this?
[203:35.51]Is this supposed to be happening?
[203:36.63]Oh, shit.
[203:48.60]Alright, watch out for the bombs here.
[203:50.22]Okay.
[203:56.70]Watch out for that bomb!
[203:58.75]It's following me, fuck!
[204:03.93]Damn it, I missed.
[204:06.77]Oh, fuck!
[204:09.01]Alright, get in there!
[204:11.73]Get the fuck out of here.
[204:23.48]I want one of those guys, because those weapons are crazy.
[204:32.98]Do I get one?
[204:33.74]No.
[204:36.22]I think I might have enough to put.
[204:38.14]Uh, 130.
[204:40.12]No.
[204:40.40]Damn it.
[204:49.33]Hmm.
[204:53.27]I kinda like this guy, though.
[204:58.65]Put it in the 20th slot.
[205:13.09]Irma, somebody said they got Chibi-Robo and they were so happy about it?
[205:18.43]Yes.
[205:32.92]When do you unlock Mewtwo?
[205:40.20]What do you guys think would happen to the channel if I decided that I was going to start from the very beginning as of... Let's just say as of tomorrow.
[205:51.03]This is a hypothetical, not real scenario.
[205:52.91]Let's just make that clear.
[205:55.61]If I decided I was going to start at Pokémon Red and play every single Pokémon game back to back to back until I got to the new one.
[206:04.70]What would happen?
[206:07.59]That literally is the only thing I did on stream.
[206:10.19]Until it was over.
[206:14.14]And it took me like three months to do it.
[206:27.51]Please do that.
[206:28.13]No, I would never do it.
[206:29.19]It's a fun thought project.
[206:33.97]But what if I did a stream where I just planted grass.
[206:38.60]And I just streamed the soil.
[206:42.08]Every day for like 8 hours until there was grass there.
[206:44.42]And then the end of that stream.
[206:46.22]The end of that whole arc of like a month.
[206:49.22]A lawnmower comes from off the screen and just runs it all over.
[206:52.63]And then the stream ends.
[207:00.59]Yes!
[207:04.65]Oh, what am I doing?
[207:05.33]I'm getting three kills in five seconds.
[207:07.11]What are you doing?
[207:07.63]Is it Woody from Toy Story?
[207:26.48]It is.
[207:28.98]What is this guy?
[207:29.52]This is like a premium Woody skin.
[207:42.36]That move is so good.
[207:43.52]It's unbelievable.
[207:50.44]Give me Woody.
[208:01.05]Give me Woody.
[208:06.13]Oh, that's okay though.
[208:07.53]That's kind of cool.
[208:08.73]Wire gunner?
[208:22.23]speed support not it's not a really bad attack really bad everything actually would assault punch wire shoot set wire wire gunner is an army member and specialist in trapping enemies in uh that web
[208:53.54]oh well I have to try everything at least once that's kind of the rule right sell huh yeah I think you can discard but you can't sell
[209:22.25]use the me gunner it is a me gunner here versus what nothing nothing on the screen let's do this I like the way that this character looks what is this
[209:56.38]Wait a minute, you did... What?
[210:06.13]Am I supposed to be grabbing them?
[210:11.55]Ooh, that's kind of good.
[210:15.05]If they touch it, they get hurt.
[210:21.98]This is kind of like a shotgun blast.
[210:25.45]Is that what that's doing?
[210:29.47]It's shooting five.
[210:30.29]Ow.
[210:31.11]You guys... I feel like that's not doing... Why would you use that when you can just do this?
[210:45.70]Why?
[210:45.90]Why?
[210:46.08]Oh, it's a harpoon.
[210:49.78]Oh!
[210:50.20]Oh, I get it.
[210:51.62]I get it.
[210:57.76]oh okay that's a lot cooler now so how many that okay he's taking a lot of punishment I can't I need like a melee would be great here actually
[211:38.02]You can bounce them around wherever you want.
[211:41.40]Is this a gimmick character?
[211:42.64]Yeah.
[211:51.69]Not yet.
[211:52.13]Why are we -2?
[211:55.26]See, I'm telling you.
[211:55.70]You guys are just manipulating everything.
[212:09.70]What happens if I do four and then... Oh, I missed.
[212:18.07]Whenever you talk, it's -2.
[212:19.87]Holy God.
[212:25.87]That's the kind of comment that makes me want to just take a break and then throw water in my face and smush it around a little and be like, Jeremy, it's alright.
[212:34.65]Get back out there and show them what you're made of.
[212:50.93]Hey, you're doing great, buddy.
[212:52.19]Thanks.
[212:55.06]They're just kind of cool.
[212:57.08]Not really.
[213:01.72]Not really more kind of advanced gameplay.
[213:07.17]I haven't even eaten it yet, tier.
[213:09.28]That's how bad I don't... Yeah, we gotta move some people down here.
[213:26.91]This is too gimmicky.
[213:33.94]Okay, I have enough to... Perfect.
[213:35.56]Look at this.
[213:39.08]Alright, let's start with you.
[213:41.90]Put you near the end, and then you, because keep the big guys for later.
[213:54.37]I made brownies.
[213:54.91]Would you like some?
[213:57.25]I love brownies, but brownies are a thing that I never, ever, ever have.
[214:00.21]Because I only eat them if somebody else makes them.
[214:11.18]Okay, do you guys like crusty brownies or chewy brownies?
[214:13.90]Very important.
[214:15.60]I'll tell you my answer after.
[214:16.60]Whoa.
[214:24.44]This is... This is... These guys look hard.
[214:31.38]What?
[214:31.64]These guys are like rares.
[214:33.24]This is like a... That's like a Megazord right there.
[214:43.91]Oh my god.
[214:49.59]Sorry, I got one.
[214:50.09]I got one.
[214:50.33]I got one.
[214:50.55]I got one.
[214:51.21]I just healed all that health.
[214:55.87]Oh, so much damage.
[214:56.55]Please.
[214:58.36]Yeah, give me that health.
[215:02.02]God damn it.
[215:03.34]Why do I have to fight so many at the same time?
[215:11.66]Get away from me.
[215:12.14]He's right fucking behind me.
[215:13.15]He's right behind me.
[215:33.77]Come on.
[215:34.35]Got it.
[215:40.24]Alright, focus on the little ones first.
[215:41.48]Because I got two big guys after this.
[215:45.36]I like this little ninja.
[215:47.88]I should put more of these guys in.
[215:48.86]Look at my whole face is itchy.
[216:03.81]Get it!
[216:05.03]Oh...
[216:11.28]He's slow.
[216:12.14]He's really slow.
[216:14.50]Give me somebody to... Got it.
[216:26.87]Kill the big guy.
[216:30.35]He's dead.
[216:30.75]I got him.
[216:32.96]Can I get one of these guys?
[216:34.14]These guys look crazy.
[216:37.52]Chewy brownies, by the way, if you're curious.
[216:40.18]The chewier, the better.
[216:43.01]I like my brownies to be... Like I could mistake them for gum.
[216:47.19]They're that chewy.
[216:50.31]To a point where they bunch up and it's like... And you think if you bite... If you pull your teeth up too hard, you're going to rip all your molars up.
[216:59.35]That's how chewy I want them.
[217:14.84]And you just, you put a little bit of milk in your mouth.
[217:17.05]So it makes it a little softer.
[217:20.75]But still, you gotta, like, I want my jaw to hurt from how hard I have to work to chew through these fucking things.
[217:42.15]A good strategy here.
[217:47.90]And then go in with a twirl.
[217:55.76]Get up there.
[218:01.31]Get... I need character that can fly.
[218:05.09]You know what I'm saying?
[218:07.13]By that I mean really fly.
[218:08.45]Like that kind of fly.
[218:09.55]Thank you.
[218:26.06]I want to be able to truly fly.
[218:34.18]Kill it.
[218:38.08]Thermos Salmonella King.
[218:41.50]Oh, I also love cookie dough too.
[218:52.29]Cookie dough is seriously like my absolute favorite thing on Earth.
[218:58.17]I remember, I used to, my mother used to make cookies and I didn't really even know how bad this was for you until I got a little bit older.
[219:09.30]She would be making cookies and I would just go over there and just, the beater would be there and I would just go in there with like a spoon and eat like three or four mounds worth of the cookie dough that was in the thing that she was making.
[219:26.24]And years later, I found out that, you know, that's not as bad for you.
[219:31.89]It's actually not great.
[219:41.11]Whatever.
[219:42.79]I'm still alive.
[219:45.17]I guess.
[219:50.03]What is this thing on me?
[219:55.01]Raw egg is good as long as it's not been out for a whole day.
[219:56.89]I'm still alive with this guy.
[220:02.17]Still gotta be careful.
[220:12.67]Alright, another flying insect.
[220:27.17]Everything will kill you in the end.
[220:34.75]I know I'm just spamming.
[220:35.75]I know.
[220:36.21]But, I mean, at some point you gotta just... Go for it.
[220:43.10]You give me melee and I'll destroy them.
[220:45.56]Alright, get in close.
[220:56.74]Get in here.
[220:58.10]Yes.
[220:58.84]Ah.
[221:00.66]Why does everybody have wings in this level?
[221:02.38]It's not fair.
[221:02.94]Everyone has wings.
[221:03.74]Except for you.
[221:07.12]You should have put wings on.
[221:20.79]Just fly.
[221:21.93]How am I supposed to just fly?
[221:23.01]Okay.
[221:34.00]This character doesn't have wings.
[221:42.20]Just get surgery.
[221:46.39]Yeah, let me bring this guy into the toy surgery shop.
[221:49.23]Put him down and just staple wings on him.
[221:51.67]I don't know.
[221:52.07]What do you want me to do?
[222:01.35]That.
[222:06.77]I want ninja guy first.
[222:14.15]What about the scene in Toy Story where... Are these guys flying?
[222:19.68]Alright, the ninja's good to have first.
[222:30.97]Oh, also.
[222:31.43]I wanted to bring this up too.
[222:34.17]We're full of announcements tonight.
[222:38.14]I'm full of announcements.
[222:41.24]Yeah, this is perfect.
[222:42.38]These flying fucking insects.
[222:48.08]So, we're going to be adding some new mods.
[222:55.54]And it's going to be a secret of who they are.
[222:57.92]You'll find out soon enough.
[223:03.41]It will be at least probably... Probably shooting for like at least five or six new mods.
[223:16.56]I'm going to shake it up a little bit here.
[223:27.53]Even the new mods don't know.
[223:30.09]Some of them do.
[223:32.48]Still want to obviously throw it out there to some other people.
[223:35.63]He said, finally.
[223:40.81]Yeah.
[223:41.77]It's been a while.
[223:51.79]Mods are Redditors.
[223:57.24]I don't know why I keep addressing the redditor messages.
[224:13.41]Better just dodge.
[224:14.25]Just dodge.
[224:16.09]Just dodge.
[224:17.55]You know what I mean?
[224:19.09]Just dodge.
[224:28.46]I need anti-air so bad.
[224:33.94]It's killing me.
[224:45.11]Okay, finally.
[224:45.81]Can I have no... I don't think I even have anything that's anti-air.
[225:03.83]Wire gunner?
[225:04.39]Oh, yeah, I could.
[225:07.37]Couldn't I?
[225:07.77]Dude, that same shit happened in the Hulk.
[225:16.38]And it just... I got flashbacks of that game.
[225:28.92]Just kill me.

[225:33.02]Kill me.
[225:33.28]So I can just do something else.
[225:34.20]I want to play as a different character.
[225:36.46]Just kill me.
[225:36.96]I want to play as a different character.
[225:38.62]This character is not good for dealing with any of you.
[225:42.23]I can only jump three times and then they're gone.
[225:49.23]Alright.
[225:55.11]Die.
[225:56.65]Okay.
[225:57.85]No more air.

[227:25.60]You can't purchase a mod spot.

[234:34.61]He's a liar.
[234:35.59]He's a liar.
[234:36.45]He's a liar.
[234:37.24]He's a liar.
[234:37.92]He's a liar.
[234:38.68]He's a liar.
[234:39.28]He's a liar.
[234:39.90]He's dead.

[234:55.01]Ah, look at that.
[234:57.57]Boy, that's cool.
[234:58.39]Kind of.
[235:00.51]Kind of impractical, though.
[235:11.98]Alright, let's go.
[235:12.98]Air fight.
[235:17.26]That was awesome.
[235:33.98]This character is cool, but hard to use.
[235:51.49]Got a weird pattern, weird trajectory.
[235:59.55]My brownies are done, they turned out extra gooey.
[236:03.78]I want brownies now.
[236:07.51]That sounds so good.
[236:12.19]Gooey and chewy and stuck on your teeth.
[236:19.45]Like when I eat a brownie, I want, when you talk to me, I want you to be disgusted because I have these gross witch teeth.
[236:34.36]Like, it's like, brownies, to me, they're like the popcorn of the sweet world.
[236:40.69]I want them just to get stuck in every crevice.
[236:43.84]Ice Valkyrie?
[236:50.52]Like, if I were to bite down, eating the kind of brownie that I like, and hold my teeth together... Like, if I took one little chunk and like... And on one side, and one chunk and... It would form... It would form a... It would be like... Glue.
[237:08.01]And after about 30 minutes, it would form a fucking epoxy.
[237:14.85]And I would just... You wouldn't be able to pull your mouth up.
[237:17.41]You'd have to go get, like, surgery.
[237:18.73]That's what I want.
[237:31.29]That's too far.
[237:32.55]Is it?
[237:33.95]Was it too far?
[237:34.51]Magic shot stick of ice.
[237:38.35]Oh, that's where the ice shit is coming from.
[237:39.77]An angel borg with cold eyes who flies using wings of ice.
[237:46.44]She hates to sweat and tries to fill the hot battlefield with ice pillars.
[237:54.86]Guard witch.
[237:58.92]Huge defense.

[249:36.73]No, I like these guys.
[249:42.29]Actually losing to a kid.
[249:57.38]What's wrong with Speed Girl?
[249:58.28]She's good.
[250:00.38]I mean, she could use some more HP, but, I mean, she's solid.
[250:16.63]She's good early game?
[250:17.85]Yeah, she's good.
[250:18.43]She's fine.
[250:20.07]Look, we don't have to get all those super rare unlockable, like, PogChamp robots.
[250:26.00]A rare bogus is good enough.
[250:27.42]I want one of these shield dudes.
[250:41.37]I didn't even get a chance to spawn.
[250:53.80]I feel kind of bad for you.
[251:01.66]Right in the back.
[251:06.07]Is this a space marine?
[251:16.13]Could be.
[251:23.94]Can I do it with the first character?
[251:25.96]Probably not.
[251:31.62]You just gotta dodge.
[251:33.04]You gotta dodge right.
[251:33.92]And I didn't.
[251:35.52]I didn't.
[251:37.46]I fucked it up.
[251:55.69]I could activate this, but why?
[251:57.45]Why bother?
[252:03.10]Why does everybody sound like they're 10 years old?
[252:04.44]I think they're supposed to be 10 years old.
[252:05.92]Alright, something good.
[252:15.66]Something worth putting in the team.
[252:17.12]Permanently.
[252:18.76]Permanent upgrade.
[252:20.94]Alright.
[252:22.36]That's a normal night.
[252:23.48]That doesn't sound very exciting.
[252:36.86]short range the broadsword cross shape slash and then shield slash this gotcha borg is warrior in the night borg corpse he wields a broadsword and his shield repels any attack I'll give it a try um
[253:06.94]I feel like my characters suck.
[253:10.02]Where are all the good unlocked?
[253:12.34]Where are all the good RNGs giving me bad ones?
[253:23.60]Try the tornado?
[253:24.62]I will after this.
[253:25.16]I'm going to try the shield guy.
[253:35.47]After this, we're going to do the bosses.
[253:40.41]Let's go with the support.
[253:41.35]Alright, so they can't hurt me.
[253:56.83]From the front only?
[253:57.83]Alright, well I don't have any moves.
[254:11.49]Alright, I'm not gonna lie, I don't hate this character.
[254:14.79]I mean obviously versus enemies that are not on the ground.
[254:22.04]You can get a good slash on here and then you block everything from in front of you.
[254:25.56]Like that.
[254:26.82]Yeah, get the fuck out.
[254:27.42]Look at this.
[254:29.80]Actually kind of good.
[254:30.42]I wish it wasn't normal knight one.
[254:43.06]Of course you like the Reddit character.
[254:44.36]Path America's a Reddit character now?
[254:49.37]Make that heal!
[254:49.85]Heal!
[254:57.33]Yes.
[254:58.65]So what's a not Reddit character?
[255:00.09]Are you sure it's not Deadpool?
[255:03.07]Are you positive?
[255:25.37]Does that hurt anybody?
[255:27.55]Oh, fuck it does.
[255:28.27]You gotta be really close for it, though.
[255:33.86]Just keep people in front of you.
[255:36.98]I'll tell you, if I get a better version of this guy, I'm putting him in.
[255:48.80]Every superhero is Reddit.
[255:52.22]That's not fair.
[255:55.90]What about Wolverine?
[255:58.16]Yeah, Wolverine's probably from Reddit.
[256:00.84]What about... So what the hell is a superhero that... What superhero am I... Hold on, let me actually rephrase this question.
[256:11.50]What superhero am I allowed to like?
[256:25.10]The Joker.
[256:26.90]I'm allowed to like the Joker.
[256:40.63]What about, um... What?
[256:43.23]Red and Stimpy.
[256:43.83]Okay.
[256:59.50]Bane.
[257:00.02]I can like Bane.
[257:00.94]At least that's good.
[257:07.73]Reddit Stimpy.
[257:10.77]You guys hate this place.
[257:14.79]You guys fucking hate this place.
[257:31.80]Have I seen such powerful anger before?
[257:33.90]Alright, let's test this theory out.
[257:42.94]Okay, that's actually pretty great.
[257:51.28]You can instantly charge that.
[257:54.78]I'm glad I took that person's advice two and a half hours later.
[258:08.90]What about the Hulk?
[258:12.48]Come on.
[258:14.06]Another battle girl?
[258:14.92]I got so many of these.
[258:17.56]I don't know what to do with them.
[258:33.47]I'm going to keep this team.
[258:35.13]For now.
[258:37.15]For now.
[258:39.06]I like it.
[258:39.40]Let's try Tornado Girl and replace the shooter guy.
[258:43.22]Alright, I have 170.
[258:49.72]Slot 20?
[258:50.00]No, not slot 20.
[258:53.76]No.
[259:02.69]Oak used to be based, but after Endgame, like after Infinity War and after like the Avengers saw, yeah, yeah, alright.
[259:09.15]Well, because they made them like cool or something.
[259:11.39]I don't get it.
[259:11.85]What?
[259:12.09]Alright, I'm going for it.
[259:16.84]Stone River.
[259:17.38]Defeat enemy gachaborgs.
[259:28.96]Let's go with the Saw Crew.
[259:40.56]That's the guy with the Bowser's castle swords.
[259:46.60]Let's try this.
[259:47.24]Up in the air.
[259:52.78]Up in the air.

[260:08.63]Come on.
[260:12.16]Whoa.
[260:14.78]That's a huge incapacitation.
[260:17.98]Holy shit.
[260:18.70]This is actually kind of good.
[260:20.79]And then you go in.
[260:26.09]Well, I mean, I wouldn't go in on their main hero.
[260:28.19]That was pretty dumb.
[260:29.05]That was pretty dumb.
[260:30.29]I'm out.
[260:30.55]Ugh.
[260:41.72]It's kind of a support character.
[260:42.78]Well, it's sort of working.
[260:49.01]I didn't get it.
[260:54.73]Go back.
[260:57.48]Go back.
[260:58.26]Sad face.
[261:07.34]Go back.
[261:13.44]Who's this Metal Sonic character?
[261:14.72]Uh-oh.
[261:23.11]Run!
[261:30.69]Can't block that.
[261:31.65]Oh, I'm getting just stomped.
[261:36.88]I'm just getting... These just styled on me.
[261:38.96]That was horrible.
[261:52.78]I give me in there.
[261:53.46]It's getting close.
[261:57.42]Goodbye.
[262:00.68]Loser.
[262:03.78]And loser.
[262:12.10]Go back.
[262:12.76]I don't even know why.
[262:13.36]Go back where?
[262:24.86]Uh oh.
[262:25.68]Superpower versus superpower.
[262:29.82]Who is winning?
[262:31.58]I think it's me.
[262:33.62]Nope.
[262:34.04]I got hit by it too.
[262:34.84]Uh oh.
[262:42.69]Okay.
[262:43.01]Gotta be careful here.
[262:45.53]He's got
[262:47.60]Oh, come on.
[262:48.16]Bogus.
[262:48.60]I need that head.
[262:56.60]God damn it.
[262:57.22]Let me... Get it!
[263:02.05]Didn't hit him.
[263:11.55]Pick it up!
[263:13.13]It's a bat.
[263:15.19]I think my partner sucked.
[263:18.42]I know, I'm blaming my partner.
[263:20.22]What a great teammate.
[263:24.40]So why do you think you lost that match last night?
[263:26.62]Well, I think it was because my teammates suck.
[263:29.40]Not me, though.
[263:30.24]I'm the best.
[263:30.84]I'm a star.
[263:36.65]They already have another special.
[263:43.37]Dude, this guy... Why do they both have these, like, hyper beams?
[263:51.71]You motherfucker.
[263:52.91]Alright, get rid of these... Get rid of these... Get rid of these dump crew.
[264:05.38]Start off strong.
[264:08.49]Bring back the vampire.
[264:10.81]What's a good counter to that shit?
[264:13.55]Oh...
[264:23.83]Angel?
[264:24.13]You think so?
[264:39.46]What do I do about this?
[264:45.02]Maybe this weirdo will be good here.
[264:49.22]Angel spam will shred health.
[264:50.79]That's true.
[264:58.14]I feel like this isn't enough.
[265:05.89]Normal Knight.
[265:08.77]I got my ass kicked with Normal Knight.
[265:10.39]I'm going to put you down here.
[265:15.48]Alright, let's try this.
[265:19.90]Magnet.
[265:22.76]Magnet's so expensive.
[265:26.35]I'll try this.
[265:26.87]See if we can do anything about it.
[265:32.73]If not, then I'm just not ready.
[265:41.24]My ally I don't think is very good either.
[265:42.58]This guy has pretty good support.
[265:48.23]Support.
[265:49.15]Air.
[265:59.90]Upvote and downvote?
[266:02.86]Yep.
[266:03.14]Just block everything.
[266:11.31]I didn't block that, why?
[266:14.41]Why are you not blocking anything?
[266:16.31]This is a no blocking, man!

[268:04.60]Right in the back.
[268:14.11]Do I get something?
[268:16.25]Yep.
[268:28.16]There it is.

[269:28.12]Um, ninja?
[269:29.28]Alright, save the game.
[269:49.72]Is this, like, Bionicle?
[269:51.32]Uh, more so, like... I don't know, what do you compare this to?
[270:01.21]It's the Death Force base.
[270:03.13]Wait, what?
[270:03.57]Defeat the Dark Knight?
[270:06.97]No, I'm not ready.
[270:10.07]Wait, what about the dragon?
[270:11.03]There's a dragon here.
[270:13.15]Gravity Trap.
[270:13.59]Battle the Cosmic Dragon.
[270:17.49]Who should I fight first?
[270:24.44]If I fight one, will it cancel out the other?
[270:29.40]Fight the dragon.
[270:30.02]Okay.
[270:38.76]We're going to get mana.
[270:51.71]Let us vote.
[270:52.91]I feel like voting for characters is something we could do tomorrow.
[270:59.57]Because I'll have enough to actually make it make sense.
[271:12.07]This dude's cool.
[271:14.30]I like it.
[271:19.40]Is it hitting?
[271:21.94]I think it's hitting.
[271:24.02]Kind of?
[271:31.05]Yeah, I am hitting him.
[271:34.21]Seems a little unfair.
[271:35.17]What's the downside?
[271:37.81]It's low?
[271:47.85]Here he comes.
[271:52.37]What?
[271:53.01]Did he turn into this dragon?
[271:54.65]Oh.
[271:58.14]That's a cosmic dragon over there.
[271:59.60]That's for sure.
[272:00.28]I got to burn this guy.
[272:02.92]Ow.
[272:16.93]From that.
[272:23.10]Shit.
[272:29.16]Give me that back.
[272:32.22]Come here.
[272:32.86]Give me that.
[272:34.90]Wait.
[272:35.42]Oh, I threw it into the hole.
[272:36.50]Alright.
[272:38.10]Don't attack.
[272:38.50]It's probably going to shoot it back at us.
[272:44.98]This fight's over.
[272:45.52]Watch this.
[273:02.45]He's so good.
[273:08.73]It's so broken.
[273:14.15]Okay.
[273:16.31]What's the team look like now?
[273:17.25]I didn't even get anything.
[273:19.27]Was there a chance I could have gotten something?
[273:21.37]Come on.
[273:24.47]Did I really get RNG'd?
[273:25.60]I didn't get anything?
[273:34.50]Let's go, Dark Knight.
[273:42.50]If you play something with fucking wicked nasty blood and guts, I want to see a game where you can fucking rip someone's head off and... Hold on, I want to read this.
[273:54.76]Dude, play something with fucking wicked nasty blood and guts.
[273:56.98]I want to see a game where you can fucking rip someone's head off and blood sprays out and your character can start licking the blood.
[274:02.14]And the blood splatters on the screen.
[274:03.71]It's wicked fucking gory and cool.
[274:05.31]That would be so cool.
[274:06.15]Let's go.
[274:13.35]Ally.
[274:13.99]Hmm.
[274:25.58]Wait, another dragon?
[274:26.48]I just beat you.
[274:30.04]I have to fight you over here, too?
[274:39.50]Getting close.
[274:41.14]No reason to be far away for any reason.
[274:45.64]Plus, this guy's gonna go underneath.
[274:50.12]Ooh, that hurts.
[274:50.90]It's okay.
[274:51.50]It's okay.
[274:52.00]It's okay.
[274:52.82]It's okay.
[274:53.36]It's okay.
[274:53.88]It's okay.
[274:54.40]Just...
[275:01.16]Alright, let's do it.
[275:06.94]You walk fucking slow, aren't you?
[275:21.06]Oh, that was cocky.
[275:30.68]He's dead.
[275:33.14]Don't worry, I'll win.
[275:41.67]He's slow, but he has huge damage.
[275:49.43]He's done.
[275:50.73]I'm gonna win.
[275:55.47]Isaac is like super monkey ball.
[275:56.77]If you like that.
[275:58.57]Way to go.
[276:00.39]But that's not it.
[276:02.19]Dragon was just a normal enemy he had.
[276:03.85]Oh.
[276:06.85]Interesting.
[276:07.25]Anybody else?
[276:17.62]Yep.
[276:18.74]Long range.
[276:22.34]Still worth it.
[276:23.72]That means there's going to be a... Oh, there's the real enemy.
[276:32.54]Oh, this just got bad.
[276:33.74]Damn it.
[276:43.76]Fuck.
[276:44.59]I need that.
[276:45.07]Ugh.
[276:48.85]Ugh.
[276:55.34]Die!
[276:58.02]Dude, who's even attacking who?
[277:21.36]Stay back!
[277:26.68]Dude, who is doing that?
[277:28.40]Where can I get one of these guys?
[277:30.00]The purple shield guys are fucking insane.
[277:45.74]I wonder if this guy... Wait, he might.
[277:49.70]Wait, what?
[277:51.90]He did it!
[277:53.06]Yeah, he just had to go up and stab him.
[277:58.42]Nice job!
[277:59.38]He just had to go up and stab him in the neck.
[278:06.75]I thought the Dark Knight was Orochi's partner.
[278:08.85]Hey, there's some strange data in the gacha box.
[278:12.65]That's the data they stole from me!
[278:26.09]Gotcha, Redman 2.0 Neo-G Red.
[278:28.99]My true power has returned.
[278:40.09]Animated cutscene?
[279:15.32]Take a look.
[279:18.42]Ooh, he's much better.
[279:25.57]Plasma Blade, Beam Gatling, and G Buster with Neo G Crash.
[279:35.88]Nice.
[279:37.50]Oh, you're definitely gonna... Let's try you out.
[279:43.58]He's worth too much now.
[279:44.48]500!
[279:44.84]Oh shit, he's worth a lot.
[279:50.52]I can't even... I only have enough for 470.
[279:55.43]What should I play with?
[280:09.76]Uh... Claw?
[280:12.66]Claw?
[280:13.50]Oh, the Valkyrian.
[280:17.56]Sword Valkyrie.
[280:18.06]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[280:20.83]And I can do a ninja.
[280:21.87]Wait, I can do somebody else too.
[280:24.57]Can somebody 170?
[280:25.75]No.
[280:26.57]I keep thinking somebody's 170.
[280:27.53]No, I'm too.
[280:30.07]Level 2 ninja.
[280:30.69]I only have 2 ninjas right now.
[280:34.74]Pretty solid team.
[280:44.45]I'm going to try one more fight, and then we're going to pick it up tomorrow.
[280:50.44]Kids don't even play this game for six hours straight.
[280:52.70]Well, it's only been like five.
[280:53.68]See how good the new G-Force is.
[281:09.03]Papa Booey, Howard Stern, penis.
[281:11.55]Alright, funny.
[281:13.27]I laughed, you got me.
[281:18.09]He's way stronger.
[281:19.81]Look at how much faster that shoots, too.
[281:22.47]Look at the reload.
[281:25.33]This is great.
[281:28.85]He has to be in every fight.
[281:30.09]Okay, hold on.
[281:31.93]That's so much better.
[281:32.83]Look at the... I love this.
[281:35.07]It's great.
[281:35.93]What about the charge?
[281:43.52]It's better.
[281:49.79]The sword's much better too, yeah.
[281:55.87]Oh, it's way better.
[281:56.71]This sword is a thousand times better.
[281:58.21]I'm chasing through under the table.
[282:02.31]Alright!
[282:12.46]We'll win next time.
[282:22.05]Okay.
[282:24.11]That's what I'm going to call it tonight.
[282:26.15]We'll be back tomorrow.
[282:27.63]But before we go, I do want to bring up some things that we'll be doing.
[282:32.61]We're going to play Gotcha Force tomorrow.
[282:35.57]And then on... Wednesday.
[282:39.08]Depending on how... I mean, I might want to beat the game.
[282:41.72]So we're going to play this until I've had my fill.
[282:47.18]We'll see what happens tomorrow.
[282:50.88]Uh...
[282:52.54]So, tomorrow, Wednesday, and Thursday is the kind of tentative plan right now.
[283:00.29]So, we'll see how it happens over the next couple days.
[283:06.33]I'm going to do brownies.
[283:09.89]Custom Robo.
[283:11.50]I don't... I mean, Custom Robo right after this.
[283:14.32]Might need a break from robots, toys, fighting each other.
[283:22.25]At some point, I do want to play the GTA Online Casino update.
[283:27.07]That came out like a year ago, and I haven't done it.
[283:33.22]We'll do that this week, too.
[283:37.78]Brownie cooking stream?
[283:38.96]Well, I mean, I think the Easy Bake Oven has a brownie.
[283:43.20]I'm fairly certain of that.
[283:44.24]So we'll see you tomorrow.
[283:47.36]We're going to play Gotcha Force again.
[283:52.17]Unlock some more robots.
[283:53.25]It's just fun to fight with robots and unlock stuff and keep upgrading.
[283:57.51]It's just like a never-ending toy.
[284:01.63]I'm having a lot of fun.
[284:02.21]It's a great game.
[284:05.25]I'll see you tomorrow.
[284:05.83]Stick around.
[284:06.69]We're going to do the bits and subs and everything.
[284:08.09]I'll see you tomorrow.
[284:14.34]This is how gotchas work.
[284:17.40]Yeah.
[284:18.88]Yeah.
[284:21.40]It's true.
[284:23.34]Don't forget to save.
[284:24.04]I just did.
[284:29.28]Let's get some music on here.
[284:31.02]Ooh, I just punched you.
[284:32.56]Sorry.
[284:32.80]This is good to just turn off.
[284:39.85]Very good.
[284:42.43]We'll check back with it tomorrow.
[284:47.47]So now we're going to do the bits from earlier.
[284:52.17]It's on the right screen.
[285:03.27]Do a rewind here.
[285:07.36]We had, for $3, Noodle is bad at gaming.
[285:09.64]Thanks for $3, Noodle.
[285:11.98]In 2003, I was born.
[285:14.70]jermaOld looking ass.
[285:16.74]jermaOld looking ass.
[285:19.93]Right.
[285:22.65]Some of you guys are young.
[285:26.35]Johnny, nice mountains.
[285:27.35]Thanks for the $5.
[285:28.17]This show featured the last voice acting gig from the deceased actor, Bela Lugosi.
[285:34.35]Interesting little tidbit of information.
[285:35.95]Thanks for sharing it.
[285:38.33]An anonymous cheer.
[285:39.03]Thanks for $15 in bits.
[285:40.40]1500 bits.
[285:41.92]Just anonymous.
[285:44.18]Somebody just dropping $15.
[285:47.46]Thanks a lot.
[285:47.90]I'll take it.
[285:50.36]SticksRenegade, thanks for the $2.50.
[285:51.78]Good week so far.
[285:53.32]I managed to grab something off an online store that was hard to get.
[285:55.64]I got a pizza, pepperoni with double cheddar cheese.
[285:58.16]It's good, I swear.
[285:59.70]You're streaming.
[286:01.14]Our state is giving 300% more unemployment money per week.
[286:04.37]And I approved the proof for stickers for the Stickerola.
[286:08.49]My sticker Toyota Corolla.
[286:12.97]Sounds like a pretty good week.
[286:18.94]And I approved the proof of stickers.
[286:25.31]The stickerola.
[286:28.83]Thanks for the 250 sticks.
[286:30.45]Glad to hear things are going well.
[286:35.56]Vinny D, thanks for the $3, Vinny.
[286:38.58]Thank you, Jerma.
[286:39.00]This is my favorite game from my childhood.
[286:40.44]We did, I think we caught this.
[286:42.72]No, no, no, no, no, we didn't.
[286:43.91]This is just another person's favorite game.
[286:45.59]I told you, you guys.
[286:47.01]Trust me sometimes.
[286:48.93]Makes me so happy to see you stream it and give it attention it deserves.
[286:51.69]Please save often.
[286:53.09]There's a save data corruption glitch in the game that is prevented by saving often.
[286:59.46]I pretty much save after every fight, so I should be alright.
[287:05.76]Yeah, it's kind of a monk ass, I would say.
[287:10.36]I'll keep it up to date.
[287:12.10]Please remind me.
[287:16.44]Please remind me.
[287:18.83]Uh, Transparitus, thanks for the $5.
[287:21.69]What am I watching?
[287:22.89]I just want Easy Bake time.
[287:24.25]Easy Bake is going to happen a little bit later than I thought.
[287:32.77]But, it'll be back-to-back with the green screen night.
[287:36.40]It will be about 15 recipes per...
[287:40.27]All of which are varying skill.
[287:43.93]Yes, there is a pizza, if you're wondering.
[287:45.52]There is a pizza.
[287:49.08]One thing that's gonna be really, really important is I gotta check the expiration dates on this shit.
[287:54.90]Because I can't... If I get these packets in the mail and they expired in June of, like, 2009, I'm not going to eat them.
[288:10.87]They're all going to be expired.
[288:14.66]I don't think so, right?
[288:17.04]I'll try.
[288:17.52]I'll take a bite of each one.
[288:18.64]But they're gross.
[288:19.89]It's going to be gross.
[288:21.41]I don't think I want to.
[288:23.59]It'll be a game time decision.
[288:26.85]A Kerbumble on top of the 10,000 bits and $100.
[288:31.17]Gives another 5.
[288:31.85]It says one last bit drop because I forgot to mention.
[288:35.32]You should look up the vocal version of the game's theme.
[288:37.64]We are gotcha for it.
[288:38.66]The Japanese vocals were removed from the localization since that's just how things were in 2003, I guess.
[288:43.25]Vocals?
[288:54.06]Let's see.
[288:54.56]Is it on YouTube?
[289:04.78]Let's see.
[289:06.90]Get this.
[289:08.74]And Gachiforce theme song with lyrics or with singing or... Opening full version.
[289:19.53]Gachiforce Japanese opening.
[289:42.30]This one is good, but that's not the one I meant.
[289:43.64]Wait, what?
[289:50.16]It's not the right one?
[289:50.90]This was Bela Lugosi's last ride.
[289:56.82]But he's singing the song.
[289:59.40]Keep playing it.
[290:00.11]Wait.
[290:02.25]Bela Lugosi's last ride.
[290:15.86]Why did they take this out?
[290:19.09]Is this the right one?
[290:57.08]Now, burn!
[290:58.04]Wake up, Gachapon!
[291:00.26]It's the power to fight together anytime!
[291:08.26]Why'd they remove this?
[291:09.84]What's the point of that?
[291:34.72]was gonna be a TV show and a line of toys that didn't sell well so they didn't do any of it
[292:08.10]Use your clout to bring back Gacha Force.
[292:15.08]Hey, Capcom.
[292:18.44]Hey, Jerma985 here.
[292:20.99]You might know me from the moderately successful YouTube channel and Twitch live streaming experiment, Jerma985.
[292:31.71]I have to bring to you today a request.
[292:35.91]There are a lot of us that care deeply about the Gacha Force franchise.
[292:42.52]Animated toys, figures, new games, robot fighting.
[292:49.75]I have made a petition and it has been signed over 31 times.
[292:57.55]If you could please have it in your heart
[293:00.05]to check out maybe bringing it back.
[293:02.75]We would really love it.
[293:03.93]We would appreciate it.
[293:05.37]Me and all the Jermamites.
[293:07.38]Well, let me say that again.
[293:09.12]Me and all the Jermamites.
[293:11.42]That was a little better.
[293:13.38]Please, Capcom.
[293:15.34]Hear our prayers.
[293:22.49]And I will end that.
[293:23.69]I will end this petition with a song.
[293:30.00]Capcom, we're all waiting for it.
[293:34.56]You know what to do.
[293:36.96]Jerma985 and the Jermamites, out.
[293:52.05]Also, one other thing.
[293:54.13]If you could somehow bring back Geno.
[293:57.86]He's a great character in the Nintendo franchise Super Mario RPG.
[294:02.60]I mean, let's be honest, if we're asking for shit that'll never happen, I might as well throw some stuff on top.
[294:11.73]I'll let it play us out with a song.
[294:15.08]We are Gacha Force.
[294:16.34]That's right, we are.
[294:17.32]31 of us.
[294:21.60]You know what to do, Capcom.
[294:25.29]We love you.
[294:27.69]Whoa!
[294:27.83]That got too loud.
[294:32.31]That got really loud.
[294:33.55]All of a sudden.
[294:35.29]Sing along?
[294:36.21]I can't.
[294:57.04]Is there lyrics?
[295:00.20]Alright, I'm going to turn on the lyrics.
[295:01.46]I have to learn Japanese.
[295:09.68]Alright, well that was fun.
[295:11.68]I'm sorry that I just... Somebody said you woke up my mom.
[295:17.62]How do I turn on the petition?
[295:19.80]That'll get us to 32.
[295:24.20]Every one of these signatures counts, man.
[295:26.25]Come on.
[295:30.99]That's a cool franchise.
[295:32.47]It just was... You know.
[295:34.67]It was kind of... I mean, it's not even like the game was dumpy at all.
[295:39.47]I mean, the game plays very well.
[295:41.01]It's a very polished experience.
[295:42.37]The game's fun.
[295:43.01]I think it's just kind of released at the wrong time.
[295:49.74]I was not going to say... I was going to say dumpy.
[295:51.12]You're right.
[295:51.74]But it's not.
[295:54.64]well made but thank you uh kerbumble appreciate it wembley ttv thanks for the 250 this awful voice actor reminds me of dynasty warriors 3. I do miss the time where Japanese video gaming companies would just get anyone who would speak English and act for the lowest price I actually think a lot of them are phonetically reading the lines from what I've understood
[296:20.07]A lot of the Japanese to English voice acting that you hear is phonetic.
[296:24.97]They just, they don't even know what they're saying.
[296:27.07]They just are told the way to say it.
[296:31.43]So, I mean, that's pretty incredible if you think about it.
[296:45.11]Shenmue 3 did it on purpose.
[296:46.45]Really?
[296:47.29]Really?
[296:50.42]Thanks for the $2.50.
[296:50.88]Hey, the Pablo.
[296:53.26]Thanks for $5.
[296:54.02]Happy four months from the VOD gang.
[296:55.82]Hello, VOD gang.
[297:00.03]Whether you watch live or watch after the fact, you still watch.
[297:04.61]Thanks for watching.
[297:08.57]Let's see if I can... SMBF Sleeves.
[297:12.44]Sleeves.
[297:15.03]Thank you SMBF for the 1000 bits $10 massive shout out to D who showed me this channel.
[297:21.07]They're a legend and so are you.
[297:24.40]I'm glad you think so.
[297:25.74]Thank you.
[297:27.26]Shout out to D. And thanks for watching.
[297:32.20]Hi, welcome to the channel.
[297:44.38]With the Jermamites here.
[297:49.27]I was going to go off on a whole speech about.
[297:57.52]I'm so glad that you were added to the list of people signing the petition, but I, you know, sometimes you have to let a joke die and that's where I'm going to, that's where I'm going to kill it.
[298:12.51]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[298:13.67]Welcome.
[298:14.79]Castline, thanks for the three dollars.
[298:16.01]Chat hates Jerma having fun.
[298:17.47]jermaPluto.
[298:18.27]I don't think so.
[298:18.87]I think originally people were like, you know, game's fucking stupid.
[298:23.33]Game's for kids.
[298:24.89]Game's fucking stupid.
[298:28.28]And then they saw the gameplay, and like I said, what's going to happen?
[298:31.44]They saw the collectible robots, they saw the characters, and all of a sudden, flipped the other way.
[298:38.48]Told you it was going to happen.
[298:49.20]They left.
[298:50.60]And that's fine.
[298:51.20]You stayed.
[298:51.72]Hey.
[298:54.62]You stayed.
[298:56.66]So we can enjoy the game together.
[299:01.06]If people don't want to watch, they don't have to.
[299:03.72]And that's fine.
[299:04.90]They left.
[299:05.88]You stayed.
[299:07.22]And we got to see the fucking voices.
[299:09.19]We got to see the cool gameplay.
[299:10.69]And we got to see the collectibles.
[299:12.57]And we got to sign the petition too.
[299:15.77]All of us.
[299:25.29]But, yeah.
[299:27.27]That's alright.
[299:27.81]Don't matter.
[299:29.65]Look, if you don't want to watch a stream, you don't have to.
[299:32.29]Not like, hey, wait, wait, wait.
[299:35.23]You left because you didn't like the game?
[299:37.07]No, I'm sorry.
[299:38.19]You're glued to the seat.
[299:39.61]You're chained to the seat.
[299:43.43]I don't know what you were doing this afternoon, but it's this.
[299:47.95]No, you can... If you don't want to watch, you can just go do something else.
[299:51.21]It's all good.
[299:55.99]Swiggy Swanky, thanks for 250.
[299:57.69]Any update on bringing back the clips?
[299:59.95]There they are.
[300:00.93]By the way, the Plan 9 movie in the VOD got muted and deleted all my clips.
[300:04.70]Not so free public domain, huh?
[300:09.50]Really?
[300:09.70]That's kind of dumb.
[300:11.00]I wonder why that happened.
[300:17.01]Well, that sucks.
[300:18.27]Why?
[300:20.17]It's a public domain movie.
[300:25.21]I want to check into that.
[300:30.24]Hey, S10WUpdate, slow update.
[300:32.64]Thanks for the $2.50.
[300:33.44]How's it going, Jerma8675309?
[300:35.96]8675309.
[300:42.97]Thanks for the $5 here.
[300:43.95]They say, fuck, I forgot the rest of my message.
[300:46.77]Anyways, glad to support you and can't wait for you to bake napalm with an easy bake oven on stream.
[300:51.37]Peace and love and best wishes.
[300:53.97]Well...
[300:55.62]I have to be careful.
[300:57.18]I'm not going to do anything dangerous.
[301:03.14]Johnny, nice mountains.
[301:03.88]Thanks for the $5.
[301:05.10]You were so pissed drunk that stream.
[301:06.72]Shouting, crying, and puking everywhere.
[301:08.27]It was so funny.
[301:09.01]I would never.
[301:17.15]There's a limit on how much I'm going to drink with a live stream on.
[301:25.47]it's it's like between four and like maybe five six drinks max maybe five I I'm I would never go to a point where I was I don't even drink like that if I'm not streaming anyway like if I'm just going out somewhere I don't like get just faced like that
[301:50.03]Yeah, you can get drunk and accidentally delete your jump ca- jump cave?
[301:54.46]Your Jump King save file.
[301:56.06]Jump ca- save cave king.
[301:58.56]Okay, I get it.
[301:59.14]I see where that came from.
[302:01.74]You can- you can be a little sloppy and delete your save file accidentally, but it doesn't mean you like puking.
[302:09.58]It's the five dollars, though.
[302:11.52]A freakout thanks to the five dollars.
[302:12.92]Jeremiah, I told you I worked at Honda, right?
[302:15.10]Well, in some Honda-related news, uh...
[302:19.42]Kristen, this person, was a mechanic at this place.
[302:25.53]And I got fired.
[302:26.39]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[302:28.77]I'm sorry to hear that.
[302:36.57]Thanks for the $5, though.
[302:40.50]Honda's a great company.
[302:44.38]Hold on.
[302:44.60]It's just...
[302:48.18]Is this person talking about drinking on the job too?
[303:01.50]Wasn't this person on thin ice?
[303:08.03]Yeah, they were.
[303:08.93]Huh.
[303:24.97]This is false lore.
[303:29.65]Well, anyways.
[303:33.26]Thanks, Jerma lied about the turkey joke.
[303:35.44]I did.
[303:36.12]That has actually happened.
[303:47.62]Those of you that don't know what that is, I was supposed to get footage of me or somebody in a big turkey mask walking by my window in my old place in Massachusetts.
[304:00.35]And I bought the mask.
[304:02.73]But before I moved to Vegas, I didn't do it.
[304:05.67]And I didn't bring the turkey mask to Vegas.
[304:14.96]So it didn't happen.
[304:18.00]It was going to be in video.
[304:20.55]How do you even know that?
[304:21.41]How do you know that?
[304:24.45]I don't think I've ever publicly talked about the turkey joke.
[304:27.17]Did I?
[304:28.31]Or are you thinking of something else, and did I just... Did you just do the detective thing?
[304:35.66]You were talking about something else completely, and I just admitted to all the crimes.
[304:38.18]Huh.
[304:39.91]Well, oh well.
[304:45.44]Hey, Snoozencopter, thanks for the $2.50.
[304:46.70]You just said you're looking for a game that plays like this, and there actually is one, but it's only on the 3DS.
[304:52.62]It's the Kid Icarus Uprising multiplayer mode, really.
[304:56.95]People actually still play it online.
[304:59.09]One of the most underrated games.
[305:00.95]It's so good.
[305:01.71]Everyone in chat that played it, back me up here.
[305:05.15]There's a ton of weapon and item variety.
[305:07.33]It was directed by Masahiro Sakurai himself.
[305:10.91]Unfortunately, you can't stream it, but you can still enjoy it on your own.
[305:13.71]It's definitely worth it.
[305:16.12]It's so good.
[305:16.68]It's so good.
[305:17.20]It's so good.
[305:19.40]Oh, my God.
[305:19.78]Yes.
[305:20.04]Kid Icarus Uprising.
[305:20.90]This shit.
[305:22.92]It's pretty good.
[305:23.48]Okay.
[305:27.26]Get Geno in here.
[305:37.41]Get him in here.
[305:41.83]I would play it.
[305:42.61]I would try it.
[305:46.74]I didn't play any Kid Icarus games ever.
[305:48.59]It would give me a nice dunk in my toes in the water for that franchise, so maybe I would give it a try.
[305:55.49]Hey, Video Games McGee, thanks for the thousand bits.
[305:58.93]Am I the only one who thinks you look and sound like someone who would play JFK in a scary movie spinoff?
[306:07.67]I don't know about that.
[306:16.26]Scary movie spin-off Like a Charlie Sheen scary movie like scary movie for I play JFK somehow is that what you mean by that?
[306:27.31]What do you mean like a scary movie?
[306:28.59]You have to mean that Disaster movie epic movie that type I Don't know I'm too young
[306:45.96]I would need another five years or so, maybe.
[306:50.08]Thanks for the 1,000 bits.
[306:52.08]Hey, 1112E, thanks for the 250.
[306:55.25]This looks like a game my dad plays on his iPad.
[306:57.93]I read this one, but it made me laugh, so I said it earlier.
[307:01.57]Thanks for the 250.
[307:02.03]Hey, Das Knight, thanks for the 300 bits.
[307:07.08]Hey, Jay, loved watching you play GF.
[307:11.55]Hold on.
[307:11.79]A little bit of gas.
[307:13.49]Sounds boring, I know.
[307:15.05]Wow.
[307:41.18]So what did they do?
[307:42.84]What could they have possibly done to hide that fact in the movie?
[307:48.52]That's interesting.
[307:50.88]Thanks for the knowledge.
[307:55.03]Yoda985 gave $250.
[307:56.67]I said this one out loud, but I want to address it again.
[307:58.71]Remember the Blood Burger sounds like a fake wrestling movie you would say when Ronald McDonald kills somebody in the Rumble.
[308:05.51]Yes.
[308:06.81]Yes.
[308:06.97]Yes.
[308:09.64]Peaceful Haley, thanks for 250.
[308:11.04]Speaking of when you talked about cheese, when I was a kid, I would always pour shredded cheese in a bowl and just eat it like that all the time.
[308:18.35]So I would have bowl issues all the time as a kid because of my consumption of cheese.
[308:24.17]So one day my stomach was killing me.
[308:25.41]Wait, bowl?
[308:26.87]You bowel?
[308:30.35]Bowl.
[308:31.70]Bowl.
[308:34.10]day my stomach was killing me and I went to the hospital he took my blood and etc and the doctor comes in and just shows me a grape and says you heard of these and after that I had a forced down prune juice and I'll never forget that have you heard of these ever hear these kid is called a vegetable
[309:01.95]Where did the grape come from?
[309:03.14]Yeah.
[309:03.70]Why did the doctor just have a grape?
[309:06.26]Was it all mushy and rotten?
[309:08.48]Was that his pocket grape that he showed to young children to scare them?
[309:13.78]And make his joke to the parents?
[309:15.10]That's funny.
[309:22.75]Thanks for the $2.50.
[309:23.19]Hey, Errorless, thanks for $2.50.
[309:26.25]Any interest in Chroma Squad?
[309:28.17]This game reminds me of that.
[309:29.53]Never heard of it.
[309:31.59]Wait, what is this?
[309:39.94]Huh
[310:02.88]This is kind of cool.
[310:04.28]I'll put it on the list.
[310:05.26]It looks alright.
[310:07.22]This seems kind of cool.
[310:07.88]It's on the list.
[310:11.48]Thanks for the $2.50.
[310:14.75]Why don't we show the credits?
[310:17.41]Let's do it.
[310:19.57]Incoming sub credits.
[310:22.91]Not until I move over.
[310:26.29]Change to you all leaving the theater.
[310:30.47]Thanks for the subs, guys.
[310:34.82]Probably wondering why it's going a little slow.
[310:37.75]Because about an hour ago, an hour and a half ago, the stream crashed because my VPN died.
[310:45.63]So these are the people that have subbed in the last hour and 30 minutes, hour and 20 minutes.
[310:57.78]The chat just exploded.
[310:59.54]It went so fast when I said the word VPN.
[311:02.00]I saw a bunch of omega lows and VPN omega lows.
[311:04.28]It was immediate.
[311:13.66]Anyways, thanks everybody.
[311:14.48]Sorry some of you got axed from this list.
[311:20.51]Sorry about that.
[311:21.07]It was because of the server I picked.
[311:22.69]I won't be picking that one again.
[311:30.76]But we will finish the bits.
[311:31.76]As always, I really appreciate anybody that subs this channel.
[311:37.35]Nobody ever is obligated to.
[311:38.69]But you do.
[311:41.19]And I can't believe it.
[311:43.63]Thank you.
[311:44.21]Thanks for giving me money on a fucking consistent basis.
[311:47.17]Some of you for like years.
[311:48.31]It means a lot.
[311:49.81]Thank you.
[311:52.31]Let us finish the bits.
[311:55.58]My eyes rolled a little bit when I saw Bela Lugosi, but then his grandchild coming in.
[311:58.52]He saved it.
[311:58.88]My eyes came back.
[312:26.19]That's funny.
[312:29.81]Yoda985, thanks for the 250.
[312:31.25]If chat keeps acting up, you should spend a week playing Pokémon as punishment.
[312:38.46]That would be punishment to me, too.
[312:40.40]So, I don't think so.
[312:44.16]I think that would punish me more than you guys.
[312:50.82]SuperParadox, thanks for $5.
[312:51.84]Jerma.
[312:53.72]Now you have to do Pokémon streams.
[312:55.32]I would literally bother you about it every stream.
[312:57.20]Don't.
[312:57.46]Please don't.
[312:59.16]Please don't do that.
[313:01.08]Don't bother me every stream about playing Pokémon.
[313:02.87]I'm not going to play it.
[313:03.67]It was like a little hypothetical thing.
[313:08.81]I'm not going to.
[313:09.61]No.
[313:09.73]Don't bother me every stream.
[313:11.11]I'll ban you.
[313:12.37]I'll just.
[313:13.37]I'll ban you.
[313:15.23]See?
[313:16.69]You asked for this.
[313:17.49]I'll ban you.
[313:19.31]Don't bother me about this every day.
[313:20.46]I'll ban you.
[313:25.25]Play Trapeze Simulator.
[313:26.35]I'll ban that.
[313:26.81]Okay.
[313:28.47]But I'm playing that tomorrow.
[313:31.64]If that's a real game and it's not like some stupid thing that's not even real, I'll play it for like five minutes.
[313:38.12]It's not even real.
[313:38.62]It can't be real.
[313:41.17]Thanks for the five dollars, Paradox.
[313:42.27]Appreciate it.
[313:44.93]I don't want to ban you.
[313:47.43]Why was that for?
[313:48.03]Started off so sweet there.
[313:48.85]And so strong.
[313:49.37]Now that you said that, I feel like you're not taller than me.
[314:10.37]I feel like that's what somebody says when they're not the thing that they just said.
[314:14.90]You gotta add that in just to make sure people know.
[314:16.56]But I don't think you are.
[314:17.40]Thinking face.
[314:26.97]Hey Yoda985, thanks for the 250.
[314:29.11]When it comes to cookie dough, you gotta cut out the middleman.
[314:32.07]Just put some chocolate chips on vanilla yogurt.
[314:34.53]Maybe a little honey.
[314:36.03]Then go to the refrigerator, grab four raw eggs, and eat those instead.
[314:39.63]Hey DarkSoul, thanks for the 250.
[314:44.80]Hey man, thanks for making me a mod.
[314:48.38]That's pretty pog.
[314:49.54]I use Reddit like every day and have positive karma.
[314:52.44]If you eat your veggies and snort your Funkos, chat, you can be like me too.
[315:02.07]Uh... Thanks.
[315:08.33]Hey, Opster Narwhal, thanks for $3.57.
[315:10.97]Jerma, I just got told... I just got told to kill myself while playing Overwatch.
[315:15.66]So I thought I'd come to be here for a little while for some positive energy.
[315:18.48]Also, I'm remastering jermaWalk so that it looks like a little cleaner.
[315:22.86]And loops better, too.
[315:24.06]Why does everybody have to be so mean and hate each other online?
[315:28.09]In video games and stuff.
[315:28.99]Why does everybody have to be like that?
[315:36.86]Why does everyone have to, like, tell each other to kill themselves?
[315:45.06]It's online.
[315:45.92]Yeah!
[315:48.56]It's just, like, it's... We need to, like, relax.
[315:51.65]You know, I think that a lot of people would, like, do well...
[316:03.89]with having some device that if it detects... If it detects you doing... This is something you set up on your own.
[316:12.49]If it detects you saying something fucking crazy, it just plays it back in your ears.
[316:17.14]Because, believe it or not, if you hear yourself say something fucking really bad and really kind of fucked up and crazy, it's actually kind of embarrassing.
[316:26.84]It is.
[316:27.06]You know what I mean?
[316:28.70]If it's like... It should just be like... Like, in your ears.
[316:32.30]Not anybody else's.
[316:35.21]Why don't you fucking kill yourself?
[316:37.19]Why don't you fucking kill yourself?
[316:39.38]No, I didn't.
[316:39.84]Why don't you fucking kill yourself?
[316:40.82]Fuck, that's embarrassing.
[316:42.14]It's really embarrassing.
[316:43.56]Do I sound like that?
[316:45.92]I sound like that?
[316:47.00]Oh, fuck.
[316:47.76]Dude, I'm sorry.
[316:49.02]I'm just kidding around.
[316:50.92]I sounded really angry and fucked up there.
[316:52.73]I don't like that.
[316:58.09]This is why we clip.
[316:59.05]Oh, don't... You know what I'm doing, alright?
[317:02.91]Don't even... I'm clearing that one.
[317:08.50]My point is like, sometimes if you hear something you say, you almost like, but nobody else needs to know.
[317:14.85]You just have to hear it.
[317:16.85]And go, ooh, fuck.
[317:18.85]That was a little much.
[317:20.73]I'm gonna turn it down a little.
[317:29.32]Next community night's gonna be something else.
[317:31.52]God damn it.
[317:36.02]No!
[317:39.90]Oh, it's going to be everywhere.
[317:42.46]It's going to be everywhere.
[317:43.80]Don't I know that I'm being recorded?
[317:46.13]See, it worked.
[317:47.29]Now I'm like, I'm embarrassed for saying something like that.
[317:49.73]Out fucking rages.
[317:51.27]And now it's been recorded and I heard it.
[318:02.50]Star used to record people like that and play it back to them.
[318:08.72]Anger is a funny thing.
[318:11.21]Because once you stop being angry, you kind of look back and go, that really wasn't even a big deal at all.
[318:21.17]Like, anger is such an interesting emotion.
[318:24.47]Because half the time when you look back, it's like, what the, what, who cares?
[318:33.49]Why would I let that get to me?
[318:35.85]Like, who cares?
[318:36.77]It's not even a big deal.
[318:42.86]Anger makes you delete your Jump King save.
[318:46.28]No, that's intoxication.
[318:48.55]I think they're two different things.
[318:58.81]I'm so... I'm going to be fucking thinking about that one in the bath tonight.
[319:03.36]Oh, no.
[319:09.86]Oh, no.
[319:12.02]because I was saying it too very very strongly and that could have been like me in a game holding the voice chat button down oh my god what have I done what have I done what have I done uh whatever anyways let's keep going
[319:39.50]I'm gonna make it my ringtone.
[319:44.55]Hey, hey, Canole.
[319:49.01]Was that your name?
[319:51.43]No, it's Canoleole.
[319:53.83]Thanks for the 400 bits.
[319:54.69]I've been watching for a long time, now subscribing.
[319:57.40]Your passive support of LGBT folks means a lot.
[320:04.22]Yeah, I've said this a bunch of times.
[320:07.32]Just do you.
[320:08.18]You know you.
[320:10.30]Nobody can tell you who... No one can tell you who you are because it's you.
[320:13.44]You know that.
[320:14.50]Nobody else knows you.
[320:15.38]You know you.
[320:16.38]And do you.
[320:17.82]Other people are going to do them.
[320:19.28]And you're going to do you.
[320:19.89]Because you know you.
[320:26.51]I still don't know.
[320:27.81]You don't.
[320:28.13]Who knows me?
[320:28.71]You do.
[320:33.67]Like I can't tell you who you are.
[320:38.67]How the fuck would I know?
[320:40.95]Hey, this is who you are.
[320:43.83]I know who you are.
[320:44.73]I have no idea.
[320:49.31]Why would I pretend to?
[320:59.68]Just kind of... This is my theory on it.
[321:05.84]Whoever you are, whatever walk of life or...
[321:10.87]However, you identify it.
[321:14.37]I do.
[321:15.13]I can't.
[321:16.59]Why would I not support somebody individually doing what they want to do with their life?
[321:24.74]It's your life.
[321:26.28]It's not mine.
[321:28.98]I can't tell you how to run it.
[321:31.90]And I mean that with everything.
[321:48.52]And there's not much more for me to say.
[321:50.02]I live my life the way that I want to.
[321:57.17]As best as I can.
[321:58.23]As best as I know that I can, how I know myself.
[322:01.17]I hope you do the same.
[322:03.45]That's it.
[322:11.96]It's my money, and I need it now.
[322:15.36]That was word soup.
[322:21.56]I mean it wasn't it wasn't word soup it was you I guess it kind of was a little soupy wasn't it but alright but you get my point though that's all that matters what if I want to sell drugs and kill people well that's illegal
[322:46.60]Like, that's... We've all agreed that killing people is not okay.
[322:52.00]That's... Almost every living human knows that killing somebody is... You are taking over somebody's life.
[323:03.91]You are taking control of somebody's life by killing them.
[323:09.23]You are putting power over somebody else's life.
[323:14.75]That's how that works.
[323:20.50]so come on streamer says wait I decide when you like no alright I'm moving on long story short I I can't tell you how to be you only you know that and I'm not going to tell you how to be you because you're the only one that knows soup eat it up hey goiki thanks for the five dollars
[323:51.77]Reddit jokes are all fun and games until they call one of your favorite characters a Reddit character.
[323:56.04]Oh, sad face.
[323:58.42]Oh.
[324:00.12]Oh.
[324:03.76]Oh, no.
[324:06.00]Not my favorite character, but Slimer and Qbert.
[324:11.65]He's a fucking dork.
[324:15.31]He's mocking us.
[324:16.27]Yes, of course I am.
[324:17.71]You know how much shit I got for Slimer back here?
[324:20.97]Wait till your character's a Reddit character, and then we'll see how you feel.
[324:24.57]Who cares?
[324:25.46]It's a fucking news website.
[324:27.26]Alright.
[324:27.54]Hey, Dinosaurus Rex, thanks.
[324:32.29]For the $2.50.
[324:37.51]Hey Jerma, for the Jerma Rumble, I know you're already spoiling us with getting us to vote for the characters that will get in, but hear me out.
[324:42.62]You should try doing a character creation contest.
[324:46.52]Each member gets to create one character, and the character with the most votes gets put into the Rumble.
[324:51.37]It could be pretty cool.
[324:53.95]That's an interesting theory.
[324:55.91]The one issue with that is turning it into a popularity contest.
[325:01.49]Because let's say, for instance, somebody makes a character that knows is going to get upvotes versus a character that's incredibly well made, but isn't part of the kind of popularity contest in a way.
[325:14.40]You know, I would have to pick them if I was going to do that.
[325:17.74]I would go through and I'd pick the ones that I would want to put in.
[325:24.58]Upvotes, yes.
[325:25.52]Something like you upvote something.
[325:32.28]So if we were to do something like that, it would only be for a certain amount of slots.
[325:37.07]Like there would be one community character or like three community characters.
[325:42.61]Or maybe the community characters could be part of their own tag team.
[325:46.81]You know, if there was like a three, like a six-way tag or like a tornado tag match, it could be the community characters versus Sam and Max.
[325:57.76]That's one of the fucking matches.
[325:59.30]No, it's not.
[326:00.06]Kidding.
[326:01.29]They'll probably be in it, though.
[326:02.55]It's like a thousand different characters that haven't been made.
[326:08.89]But no, it's a good thought.
[326:10.07]I'll only give it a shot.
[326:12.12]Yeah, I would just choose.
[326:16.32]Because then it would just be like, oh, Jerma just picked these.
[326:23.75]He didn't pick mine, but there was a ton of things to choose from, and he picked just ones that he wanted.
[326:30.42]And that would be it.
[326:33.34]Hey, the uber noob.
[326:37.30]The uber noober.
[326:39.86]The uber noob.
[326:40.78]Thanks for the $3.
[326:41.36]Yeah, they did.
[326:55.07]That's late.
[326:55.33]That's very late.
[326:55.69]Well, I'm not sure if I should say good morning or good night.
[326:57.71]Either way, one of those two.
[326:58.45]Thanks for the three bucks.
[326:59.85]Thanks for hanging out.
[327:00.59]Glad to have you here.
[327:25.44]Hey, a friendly spider.
[327:26.54]Thanks for the $5.50.
[327:27.46]Yo, Yerma.
[327:29.08]Just want to say, even though this is like message number 5,000, that you're a fucking awesome guy who always provides great entertainment no matter what.
[327:36.37]Please keep doing what makes you happy.
[327:37.67]Cheers.
[327:38.57]Always.
[327:40.85]I will always try to do things that make me happy and make me have fun and especially on this stream.
[327:49.98]Going for it.
[327:51.26]Trying.
[327:53.12]Thanks for the $5.50.
[327:53.48]Thanks.
[327:57.98]And thanks for the incredibly nice message.
[328:02.00]Hey, Clowers V, thanks for 250.
[328:03.54]I remember back when Dermot refused to play us some ads, even when chat was begging for it.
[328:08.57]Now Dermot talks nonstop about fast food chains and even makes us watch their adverts.
[328:13.79]And he does it for free.
[328:15.25]Ernie Pogg.
[328:17.75]Nobody has to pay me to tell you that the McChicken is, like, one of my favorite things in the world.
[328:21.96]Why would somebody, why would there need to be a transaction there?
[328:24.70]Like, that's just a fact from my mouth.
[328:26.68]Like, the McChicken is my favorite, one of my favorite things in the world.
[328:30.59]I, nobody has to pay me to say that.
[328:32.01]That's just a, what, that's just a real fact.
[328:43.74]Donald!
[328:44.42]Oh, I had it too and it fucking trumpeted off at the end.
[328:47.68]Damn it.
[328:48.06]Whatever.
[328:49.68]It was close.
[328:50.48]And then it just like, duh.
[328:56.47]Hey, Halulu, thanks for the 300 bits.
[328:58.17]$3.
[328:58.59]Hey, Adjerma, I don't know if this would be feasible.
[329:01.53]Back when you played Rollercoaster Tycoon 2, you mentioned needing servers to use the Twitch integration.
[329:06.73]I was wondering if the FTK servers could be used.
[329:11.03]Oh, I don't think so.
[329:14.36]Because I think they're... I don't know.
[329:17.10]That's a question for the FTK guys.
[329:21.05]I have no idea.
[329:27.51]Anyway, hope you're doing well.
[329:28.47]Much love and stay safe.
[329:29.43]You as well.
[329:31.37]Right back at you.
[329:33.72]Aw, futz.
[329:34.28]Thanks for the $5.
[329:35.30]Just wanted to say hi.
[329:36.08]Hope you're doing well.
[329:37.28]Thanks for giving me $5.
[329:38.02]Hope you're doing well too.
[329:40.10]Thanks.
[329:41.00]The five smackaroodies.
[329:44.67]CastLion, thanks for the $3.
[329:46.27]Please, please, please, please look into playing Armored Core 4.
[329:49.36]Answer for the PlayStation 3.
[329:51.20]I'd pog so hard.
[329:53.00]If it's not your thing, that's fine too.
[329:57.70]It might be.
[329:59.26]That would take a little bit of research.
[330:05.83]Why 4 in particular though?
[330:08.72]Uh, Dr. Noobstein, thanks for the five dollars.
[330:11.58]Jerma, if you tried, I bet you could be huge in Japan.
[330:14.50]You'd be in that little box in the corner of the screen doing wacky reactions while some girl gets spanked in front of a studio audience with everyone laughing.
[330:24.07]Wait, what?
[330:25.11]And you'd do the look of me as your trademark and the Japanese audience would collectively lose their shit and cheer for you.
[330:29.97]You know what I'm saying?
[330:32.65]I'm sure someone from chat could get you on a show.
[330:45.47]in the corner doing just wacky reactions I mean I would do it I would do it I would go on one of those I would go on one of those shows and just do like that look at me look at me just like three or four times that would be I don't with like the hands I would just hit you that would be fun and that would be an excuse to be in Japan and visit Japan eventually
[331:13.75]I don't know.
[331:14.25]If anybody has any... If anybody knows anybody that does Japanese TV shows.
[331:19.80]I don't know.
[331:20.36]That's probably pretty... That's probably not very many people.
[331:22.44]I don't know.
[331:25.34]That'd be fun.
[331:26.66]Hey, Goober Juice.
[331:27.26]Thanks for $2.50.
[331:29.88]If the Lugavitant becomes a TF2 taunt, would you play TF2 again?
[331:34.59]I don't... I don't know, man.
[331:36.97]Eek.
[331:42.39]The look at me talk, the look at, look at, look at me is just... Like, me pretending that you're talking... And... Like, look at me, I'm talking, look at me, look at... Is that... He hates TF2.
[332:02.36]No, it's not the lion pose.
[332:04.22]The look at me is... Oh, look at me, I fucking know everything.
[332:06.74]Oh, look at me, I'm talking.
[332:07.84]Oh, I, everything I'm saying is fucking stupid.
[332:09.70]That's, that's what the look at me is.
[332:12.42]It's like, you're explaining your joke.
[332:15.54]Don't explain your joke.
[332:16.45]Well, I don't know.
[332:17.67]People probably have no idea.
[332:18.59]There's probably some people here that don't even know what you're talking about.
[332:22.43]Why are they saying, look at me?
[332:25.89]Let's be honest.
[332:26.51]If you're still here, there's no way, right?
[332:31.16]Like, if you're here right now, you probably know.
[332:37.10]Well, somebody said it was the lion taunt, so I had to correct them.
[332:39.18]No, it's the one where you go, look at me.
[332:45.34]Somebody said that.
[332:55.26]Hey, Goober, thanks for 250.
[332:56.72]Hey, dumbass985.
[332:57.76]How come brownies always get the attention?
[333:00.99]I wish Jerma would bake me easily in an oven.
[333:06.59]But no, for real.
[333:07.27]Yeah, play Armored Core or Zone of the Enders.
[333:10.89]What?
[333:11.11]I think this is a typo.
[333:16.77]Hey, Jerma lied about the turkey joke.
[333:18.13]Thanks for $5.
[333:18.93]I bought more bits just to tell you the name was about the Mr. Bean Turkey on head joke.
[333:24.08]So you did just admit to the crime.
[333:26.36]I had no idea about the other turkey joke.
[333:28.36]Yep.
[333:32.18]Yep.
[333:34.06]Well, you got me.
[333:37.48]We have a few more bits to do, but we're going to call it an end.
[333:42.86]Good night, guys.
[333:43.30]I'll see you tomorrow.
[333:44.40]Got you forced around the same time.
[333:47.11]Take care of yourselves.
[333:47.83]Have a good night.
[333:48.61]Have a good sleep.
[333:52.01]Wherever you are.
[333:54.48]We do have a little bit more to do.
[333:55.48]We have Stix Renegade for $2.50.
[333:57.10]Pokémon or Jackie Chan Stuntmaster?
[333:59.68]Hey, I'm banned, guys.
[334:00.56]See ya.
[334:02.46]I definitely would play Jackie Chan Stuntmaster before Pokémon.
[334:06.07]That's a fact.
[334:08.41]Moo means moo thanks to the $4.
[334:10.27]Bela Lugosi died in an unfortunate walk-in of an accident.
[334:13.77]That's unfortunate.
[334:18.67]Hey Edge, thanks for the three dollars.
[334:20.17]Jerma, turn on smart click maps, thank you.
[334:22.27]No, you're gonna make a dick.
[334:24.39]Happens every time.
[334:26.69]Maximum Watts, thanks for five dollars.
[334:28.35]Hey Jerma, I just wanted to say I really appreciate your words on the matter of people telling each other to kill themselves.
[334:33.46]Not that anyone cares, but I've seen family members and next door neighbors take their own lives and it never leaves me as a human being.
[334:40.28]I know people are going to joke and laugh and that's okay, but I was in a dark place today remembering a lost childhood friend.
[334:45.52]Interesting how you bring that up today, thank you.
[334:52.58]Nobody wants to feel shitty, you know what I mean?
[334:55.95]Nobody wants to feel bad about stuff.
[335:01.21]And that's why it's... I've always thought that there was some... There was some, like, level that you just kind of just don't... You don't, like... Especially in a setting where you don't know anybody, and I guess that's the reason why people do it.
[335:18.02]It's why people do anything like that.
[335:19.44]It's saying wicked, just awful shit, because... And these people don't know who the fuck I am, and who cares?
[335:33.65]so it's unfortunate but that's just kind of the nature of the internet where it's just kind of people just kind of say crazy shit that's the way it is at this point it doesn't mean that it can't affect somebody you know what I mean if like somebody if you hear that and it's like well that sucks because I like know somebody that happened to do that and fuck now you know I have to think about that
[336:02.79]Where on the other end, it's just like somebody just kind of talking shit, right?
[336:08.21]It's the nature of kind of anonymous everybody.
[336:11.68]Because the person that's saying it does not know that about you and, you know, they, you don't know anything about them, they don't know anything about you, and it's just kind of noise.
[336:25.26]It's way, one would call it word soup, yeah.
[336:36.88]soup this is nonsense this is all nonsense what am I like hearing myself talk am I like going crazy tldw too long didn't watch
[337:07.61]Try to relax on the fucking internet.
[337:10.61]You know, you just pump the brakes a little.
[337:19.83]Just relax.
[337:24.95]We're bored and we're cooped up.
[337:26.93]No, but you know what I mean.
[337:28.39]But people like talk shit.
[337:34.46]But this talking shit.
[337:37.57]And then he's just trying to be as awful as possible.
[337:41.12]You know what I'm saying?
[337:41.84]I like jokey shit talking.
[337:52.79]I think a lot of people do.
[337:53.97]I do.
[337:55.87]It can be fun.
[338:03.14]Regardless.
[338:05.26]Thanks for the five dollars.
[338:07.50]And it does affect people, as you can see.
[338:12.53]Hey, AppKey, thanks for the $5.
[338:14.27]Jerma, any plans to play DBZ games?
[338:16.17]It'd be pretty neat.
[338:17.59]I think I'd want to watch the DBZ show before I play the DBZ games, which has not happened yet.
[338:22.02]And might never happen.
[338:25.32]We'll see.
[338:33.74]Uh, Psalmness, thanks for the $5.
[338:35.32]Jeremy, so excited for the League of Legends and Valorant back-to-back stream tomorrow.
[338:41.10]Uh, Pokémon's more likely.
[338:42.20]You want to have that tier system set up?
[338:45.02]I got a question, though.
[338:45.74]Does chat ever overwhelm or exhaust you?
[338:48.08]I can't imagine being called a fucking weirdo for hours by thousands of people without losing my mind.
[338:53.73]Um, eh.
[338:55.33]No, I mean, if I start to... Well, that's when I turn streams off.
[338:59.41]You know, if I, like...
[339:02.20]If it's like, okay, I've kind of had enough.
[339:05.52]Not of chat, but just in general.
[339:07.74]Like, usually I kind of just gauge after four, five, six hours.
[339:11.25]If it's like, I'm going to take a break and kind of get out of here.
[339:20.05]So no, not necessarily overwhelm or exhaust, but I kind of just gauge how I currently feel on a really almost minute to minute basis.
[339:33.76]As you see, some streams can be... And I mean, the reason why I'm making streams four to five hours now... This one will be about six, but... It's just because of medical reasons.
[339:42.86]I'm just trying to not sit in the same place for more than four or five hours at a time.
[339:48.92]And it's helping.
[339:50.37]So that's the reason for that.
[339:52.35]But no...
[339:54.35]You'll know.
[339:56.51]If I really need to take a break, I usually just go, alright, I'm out of here.
[340:00.93]I don't make a big deal out of it.
[340:04.79]You guys are so exhausting the absolute fuck out of me.
[340:08.70]I can't take it anymore.
[340:09.88]Goodbye.
[340:10.60]No, that doesn't really happen.
[340:13.94]Doesn't really happen at all.
[340:19.54]But, yeah.
[340:21.66]It usually goes pretty smoothly.
[340:23.99]Thanks for the $5.
[340:25.77]Hey, Travelboy, thanks for $5.
[340:27.19]Your take on LGBTQ is the libertarian take on LGBTQ.
[340:32.29]We've finally gotten a political opinion out of you.
[340:35.49]You're a centrist.
[340:36.23]Uh-oh.
[340:46.28]Uh-oh.
[340:50.58]How does that... Wait, how do you go from libertarian to centrist?
[340:58.71]Uh-oh.
[340:59.19]Okay, we're going down the rabbit hole.
[341:12.23]He's a centrist libertarian communist.
[341:15.59]Yeah, whatever.
[341:16.57]That's fine.
[341:20.90]Just say that.
[341:22.12]That's alright.
