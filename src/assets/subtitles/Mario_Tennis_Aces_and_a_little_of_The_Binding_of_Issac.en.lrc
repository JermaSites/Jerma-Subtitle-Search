[00:12.71]Like, I was upstairs drinking paint for, like, five hours.
[00:21.34]No, don't do that.
[00:22.90]What's wrong?
[00:23.68]Wait.
[00:25.54]Hey, we get to see Waluigi.
[00:31.12]I'll play Mario Tennis.
[00:33.68]Close that software.
[00:34.86]I'll embarrass myself.
[00:36.60]Who's playing right now?
[00:37.80]It's me.
[00:49.28]Let me change this to tennis.
[00:50.50]I don't want to play this game, but I am.
[00:52.61]We've been streaming for an hour.
[00:54.57]Let's just hang out.
[00:56.05]Ask me anything.
[01:02.94]Alright, sizing up the competition still works for Mario Tennis.
[01:06.36]What's the name of this one?
[01:07.10]There's like 30 of these games.
[01:08.70]Mario Tennis Ultra Smash.
[01:12.36]Mario Tennis Open, Mario Tennis Aces, Mario Power Tennis, Mario's Tennis, Mario Tennis Power Tour.
[01:17.82]Those are Aces.
[01:24.51]Why did I get this over Breath of the Wild?
[01:27.85]I don't know.
[01:30.02]Alright, let's just do... Adventure.
[01:33.36]I was playing through the Adventure.
[01:38.80]So, we're at the Ancient Altar.
[01:39.84]And we're gonna move on.
[01:42.77]You ever seen anybody play Mario Tennis on livestream before?
[01:46.51]I don't know.
[01:47.25]Maybe not.
[01:48.99]I might be the first guy.
[01:52.65]Play multiplayer.
[01:54.76]I want to just play the adventure mode.
[01:57.12]It's no stress.
[01:57.74]You just have to knock balls back into the captain.
[01:59.72]It's easy.
[02:07.58]Don't play single player.
[02:08.68]Play multiplayer.
[02:09.96]I don't know even how to play.
[02:27.53]I'm not gonna read the story If you've ever read the story in a Mario themed video game since 1998 You're wasting your time They're all the same story Just put on a different game
[02:55.59]Paper Mario.
[02:57.37]Yeah, they made him out of cardboard and he had to escape the book.
[03:02.70]Oh, did he?
[03:03.46]Did he get out of that book?
[03:06.06]Alright, let's go.
[03:06.88]Watch this.
[03:07.14]I'm going to kick this guy's fucking ass.
[03:12.16]I don't think I know how to play tennis.
[03:13.60]By the way, guys, I'm going to go multiplayer.
[03:14.98]I'm going to go 0 and 6.
[03:17.26]Flip it around and then show me that score.
[03:19.44]6 and 0.
[03:19.83]I thought I was fucking around.
[03:24.68]I am un-fucking-believable at this game.
[03:26.38]I just sharked everybody here.
[03:34.53]The fuck?
[03:34.83]You did think you saw somebody do that, did you?
[03:46.87]Secretly, I already beat this game like five times, and it's my favorite game on the Switch.
[03:51.07]And I was like, no, dude, I don't even want to play this.
[03:53.09]What if this game gets stupid?
[04:01.25]Oh, he's fast.
[04:08.01]You're not going to catch that.
[04:08.99]Eat it.
[04:14.92]and play multiplayer.
[04:15.82]I will, I just need to make sure I remember just what it was like to stomp on somebody, you know what I mean?
[04:22.76]Oh, by the way, if you didn't know, there is a Dark Souls parry in this game.
[04:27.40]I don't know why they added it.
[04:33.04]For some reason, they added a parry.
[04:34.96]Yeah.
[04:36.58]You actually have to parry somebody if they do a purple shot at you.
[04:40.48]Everything is Dark Souls.
[04:41.26]It is, because that's... Oh, speaking of Dark Souls.
[04:44.90]Hey!
[04:46.16]Just want to make sure you guys are aware of the new thing that they've decided to come out with.
[04:50.83]Oh, it's a Dark Souls trilogy!
[04:53.95]They're starting to turn it... You know, Todd Harris really should get involved.
[04:57.53]Because they are releasing Dark Souls as much as Skyrim has been released.
[05:04.85]Seriously.
[05:08.72]It's just Dark Souls Remastered.
[05:10.76]And then the other two.
[05:12.96]But they already... Why are they being sold as a package deal now?
[05:17.10]I don't get it.
[05:20.82]Todd Howard.
[05:21.42]Yeah, whatever.
[05:28.65]Goodbye.
[05:29.01]Alright, now I'm ready to play on multiplayer and just like stomp.
[05:40.89]Watch the shadows die twice gameplay?
[05:42.47]I already did, it looks incredible.
[05:45.70]I don't want to do a second set against this guy.
[05:48.06]What was the goal here?
[05:53.07]How do I get out of here?
[06:08.10]Equip it.
[06:08.68]No, I'm gonna go do multiplayer like everybody wants me to do.

[07:24.59]I've never done this on this particular account, but on the other account, I mean, god damn, standard class.
[07:32.24]I'm gonna play with my number one favorite character in the entire series.
[07:35.79]Anybody know who it is?
[07:48.69]That's right, Spike, the frog that they introduced in this game.
[07:59.72]How many- are there this many people?
[08:05.75]Jeremy, tournament rating 2000.
[08:07.33]Wait, I'm going up against people that know what they're doing.
[08:13.08]Checking connection to opponent.
[08:14.62]Looks pretty awful.
[08:16.90]Can't wait till this guy drop shots me and I see it three seconds later.
[08:24.76]These are actual competitive matches.
[08:27.64]Alright, come on Cole!
[08:38.50]Why is it... Toad, get off the screen!
[08:42.78]Oh, you missed it!

[08:47.18]Oh, shit!
[08:47.62]I... Stop talking!
[08:49.64]Whoops-a-daisy.
[08:50.36]Okay, I gotta... I looked at the chat for a second.
[08:52.16]Hold on.
[08:54.56]There's no replays in multiplayer.
[08:59.48]Oh, goddammit.
[09:00.24]Okay, hold on.
[09:02.96]It's the first time I've ever played with this character, by the way.
[09:17.30]I've never played with this guy.
[09:18.76]Get it.
[09:27.43]Oh, he fucked with me.
[09:28.19]Alright, whatever.
[09:28.71]Alright, so what does that move do?
[09:32.47]His right stick.
[09:34.57]Has this guy ever played this game before?
[09:36.29]The answer is, actually, jokes aside, no.
[09:40.72]I played for about 12 minutes.
[09:47.99]Oh fuck, what is this thing?
[09:56.28]What the fuck?
[10:06.79]Where's my, like, fun moves that I get to do?
[10:15.27]Swing at it!
[10:25.11]He's got like another super move!
[10:26.37]What the fuck is happening?
[10:43.58]Why does he keep getting that star thing?
[10:44.96]Where's my star power?
[10:48.32]I need to like charge?
[10:49.64]That's what I'm trying to- That's what I'm doing!
[10:51.02]Where's my star thing?
[10:53.55]How come I don't get it?
[10:57.21]What?
[10:58.51]How come I wasn't getting any of my zone shots?
[11:08.18]Well, that's what happens when you play for 13 total minutes ever.
[11:12.64]And you've never played a Mario Tennis game ever in the rest of your entire fucking life.
[11:28.29]So honestly, what the fuck was that?
[11:29.97]I'm not going to be that shitty character.
[11:32.14]I'm going right to the fucking shitty, another shitty character.
[11:35.72]Who cares?
[11:36.36]Let's go.
[11:43.29]Was it Windows ever?
[11:45.41]Where?
[11:47.17]What happened?
[11:47.57]What do you mean Windows?
[11:56.53]There was a Windows notification sound.
[11:58.21]Alright, but like in reality though, where were my zone shots?
[12:05.35]She had one every time.
[12:09.34]She's top tier.
[12:14.24]Let's go.
[12:21.36]I thought that was me.
[12:22.38]Wait, are you playing as Yoshi?
[12:23.94]What do you mean?
[12:27.34]Why am I reading chat right now?
[12:37.60]Oh, he's going for it.
[12:38.72]There it is.
[12:44.80]Why am I reading?
[12:46.00]I don't know.
[12:47.61]I can't explain this shit.
[12:52.83]Damn it!
[12:54.47]I'm gonna get mad.
[12:55.57]Just watch.
[12:57.51]I'm gonna get, like, very mad.
[13:01.27]You guys are fucking kidding me.
[13:06.89]I hate this game.
[13:08.56]Ow, fuck!
[13:11.86]Nooo!
[13:29.77]Actually mad over a children's game.
[13:34.08]Alright, I think he's gonna do it.
[13:45.96]Not quite.
[13:49.22]Here he goes.
[13:49.74]Alright, I gotta be ready.
[13:50.46]Blocked it.
[13:57.93]Ah!
[14:04.12]Oh my fucking god damn it.
[14:09.05]This is why we said Binding of Isaac.
[14:21.65]Why did we...?
[14:28.30]What is this?
[14:28.86]What's zone speed?
[14:39.11]What is zone speed?
[14:44.08]Come on.
[14:58.90]So I have full power.
[15:00.34]Where is my shot?
[15:01.98]Why can I not do it?
[15:03.26]Why does he get to do it every single fucking time?
[15:20.60]I can't leave now.
[15:21.36]I don't know what to do.
[15:24.40]I don't know how to solve this.
[15:39.89]Why won't anything happen?
[15:50.19]Oh my fucking god, I just let it go by me.
[15:52.51]Brian!
[16:13.71]Ignoring the tutorial.
[16:15.03]I only did this because the last game was so fucking bad that we had to play something else Let's do this one and I'm gonna be towed to make everybody in chat angry This game's just not for you.
[16:41.08]No, this game's good.

[17:30.45]Wow, I'm confused.

[18:33.04]That's his pirate flag.
[18:45.38]Ooh, diving shot there.

[19:20.13]Dude, this kid got this for a Christmas present last year.
[19:22.33]He doesn't even care.
[19:24.59]Like I do.
[19:25.63]I jumped over it.
[19:26.95]I'm going to lose.
[19:42.11]I lost.
[19:43.39]I'm uninstalling the game.
[19:47.43]How am I... How does he know that you're not a kid?
[20:04.71]I pretty much am a kid.
[20:05.83]At least this kid did the tutorial, okay?
[20:28.78]I don't even care about any of this.
[20:41.73]What is this little star dog shit here?
[20:43.59]What the fuck?
[20:46.57]Good job, Nicholas.
[20:48.45]Good luck in the first grade next week.
[20:52.53]God damn it, man.
[21:12.97]I'm doing this one more time.
[21:18.25]I'm gonna play as Super Mario.
[21:25.11]I did the tutorial.
[21:25.99]I'm just kidding.
[21:26.55]I know about like zone shots.
[21:28.19]I did charge shots.
[21:29.37]I know how.
[21:30.46]Trust me.
[21:30.84]Don't worry.
[21:33.38]But that doesn't mean that I have... As long as you've seen me play the game.
[21:38.96]is as long as I've played the game, plus like nine extra minutes.
[21:51.81]So don't worry, everything's gonna be fine.
[21:53.30]Alright, we got a mirror match here.
[22:06.84]Do I know about the time slowing?
[22:07.82]Yeah, if I hold R, I can slow down time.
[22:10.56]Special moves.
[22:11.36]But I don't know how to activate the special move.
[22:14.25]It just kind of randomly pops up sometimes as the star on the ground.
[22:20.91]Alright.
[22:21.79]No more fucking around.
[22:36.00]This guy's not top 200.
[22:51.24]Mario mirror in a Mario game.
[22:53.92]He's gonna taunt me?
[22:59.46]I thought I could... Now he's taunting.
[23:11.18]You hit it?
[23:13.91]I don't believe it.
[23:21.83]Link to Jeremy's stream?
[23:23.43]Wait, what?
[23:25.85]I am Jeremy.
[23:26.53]That's me.
[23:27.06]No, not me.
[23:38.96]What do you mean?
[23:50.96]Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Tennis Court Games.
[23:56.14]Don't want to backseat, but play... No, please backseat.
[24:01.34]His mom just called him.
[24:03.70]I think I might be actually playing against somebody that may or may not have just been called to dinner.
[24:14.14]What time is it?
[24:15.72]It's 7.30 p.m.
[24:16.00]Eastern.
[24:19.93]I'm gonna take that one as a win.
[24:20.67]That's a forfeit.
[24:21.25]I take that as a win.
[24:37.45]He didn't rage quit.
[24:39.95]Alright, that's the all... I just need the... That's the confidence I needed.
[24:48.06]So it's L to do the super move.
[24:50.02]Okay.
[24:53.04]Alright, this time it's Jeremy versus Nick.
[24:57.29]This is not to be confused with Nicholas.
[24:59.95]Different.
[25:07.01]50% win ratio.
[25:10.14]Alright, let's go.
[25:10.80]Let's go, Toadette.
[25:18.61]You're doing spin.
[25:19.27]You're doing spins and shit.
[25:21.47]How do you do the spins?
[25:22.25]I didn't do that advanced spins tutorial.
[25:25.17]How's he cutting it like that?
[25:31.86]How's he doing the cutting?
[25:34.26]Backseat.
[25:34.96]Backseat me, please.
[25:37.05]The other joystick?
[25:54.94]Jesus Christ.
[25:56.78]It's the face buttons?
[26:01.42]Oh my god, I'm dead.
[26:15.39]I'm dead.
[26:16.45]I'm dead.
[26:17.73]I died.
[26:18.59]I'm not gonna win this.
[26:21.41]This guy knows exactly what the fuck he's doing.
[26:25.83]The star on the floor lets you spike it.
[26:27.07]Yeah, I know that.
[26:27.63]It's with R, right?
[26:28.43]Or ZR, whatever the hell it's called.
[26:32.92]Oh my lord.
[26:36.42]Just say my mom's calling me for dinner.
[26:43.22]Oh my god.
[26:45.09]I will never beat this guy.
[26:51.55]Yeah, sorry I don't have 50 hours in Mario Tennis.
[26:56.62]Sorry.
[27:00.49]Do I need to apologize?
[27:07.89]This is this dude's favorite game.
[27:39.60]Alright, I'm going to torture myself one more time.
[27:42.64]And then dropkick my switch out the window.
[27:49.95]No, I did do the... I was making that up.
[27:52.37]I did the tutorial already.
[27:53.71]The whole thing.
[27:54.63]I had to do the adventure mode.
[27:56.63]I beat like three bosses in adventure mode.
[28:00.15]I had to do the tutorial.
[28:01.48]I was making it up to not look so bad.
[28:11.38]That was like a week and a half ago.
[28:12.84]And I didn't like the game so I stopped playing it.
[28:20.85]Look at that shit.
[28:22.35]What the fuck is this?
[28:23.43]This guy's throwing a wiffle ball across the court.
[28:37.48]Oh my lord.
[28:45.72]Now, by the way, you're gonna watch me uninstall this ice cream.
[28:50.68]I wish I could refund it.
[29:08.85]Don't curve it at me!
[29:09.99]God damn it!
[29:15.85]Alright, so how come I'm trying to curve it Why did that just happen
[29:46.41]Hold B to curve?
[29:47.27]That's what I'm doing.
[29:48.31]Alright, I'm gonna hold B. Holding B. Didn't do anything.
[29:53.84]I'm hitting the analog.
[29:55.10]I'm hitting the face buttons.
[29:56.16]I can't do it.
[30:10.63]That is the curve?
[30:17.96]Come on, serve it.
[30:27.90]Tricky characters curve the ball, so I can't curve the ball.
[30:39.29]Oh my god, I got a point.
[30:52.70]Back it up Get over the net, please No bullshit don't even think about it just when I start to like learn how to play don't do it
[31:53.93]No, I did it on normal.
[31:54.75]Everyone's going to make fun of me.
[31:55.57]Hold on.
[32:05.25]I can't play that game.
[32:07.39]That, I'm telling you, something about that game, tennis, it makes me want to rip my hair out.
[32:13.16]Especially when I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.
[32:19.62]So now we're going to play a game that's like three years old.
[32:30.40]I got Mr. Boom!
[32:32.92]It's a fighting game that's not a fighting game.
[32:34.52]Oh, I can't even do it.
[32:37.20]I will turn purple by the time I'm done playing that game.
[32:44.56]Old games are the best, but Binding of Isaac really is one of the best games, isn't it?
[32:47.25]Remember this game?
[32:48.85]Remember when Binding of Isaac came out?
[32:51.55]It was so good, wasn't it?
[32:58.37]You'd pay to see that.
[33:07.93]Now, this is a tricky room!
[33:10.27]It's tricky!
[33:18.33]Hey.
[33:26.08]Fucking god.
[33:27.22]No, I didn't want to do that.
[33:29.28]Oh my god.
[33:29.88]Dude, Mario Tennis?
[33:32.42]It's seriously like, it's gonna be like Bob Barker, man.
[33:37.21]Like, I am so unreasonably angry right now.
[33:40.53]I have to restart.
[33:57.43]Just push the fucking button.
[34:02.06]Mario Tennis is super rage-inducing.
[34:03.80]Oh, it is.
[34:05.18]I can't even stand it.
[34:09.00]Why do you think I played it for 10 minutes and never played it again?
[34:11.52]Because I turned into a fucking tea kettle the first 10 minutes.
[34:35.46]It's because you're bad.
[34:38.02]And you know what?
[34:38.68]I ain't gonna lose very much sleep from being bad at Mario Tennis.
[34:44.08]I don't think that's gonna affect me very much.
[34:46.12]I don't think that's gonna be a big deal.
[34:50.92]In the grand scheme of all things.
[35:00.37]Yes, it will.
[35:01.53]No, it won't.
[35:02.57]It's not gonna affect me.
[35:07.70]I'm not gonna let it affect me.
[35:14.94]It's not affecting me.
[35:16.22]It's not affecting me.
[35:17.12]I'm fine.
[35:17.66]I'm just fine.
[35:26.59]Shiny rock.
[35:27.55]Ooh.
[35:35.50]It clearly is.
[35:38.57]I know it is.
[35:41.98]And I'm gonna die in this too.
[35:43.34]I just was like painting all day like I'm fucking fuming right now.
[35:59.77]I don't even care.
[36:37.28]Unreasonably angry.
[36:38.93]How long does this last?
[36:53.37]Shoot the poop.
[37:00.15]Come here, Lust.
[37:01.91]Just not in the spot to play any games right now.
[37:05.90]And the thing is, I knew this today.
[37:08.76]But I did it anyways.
[37:12.32]That's me being stupid.
[37:17.11]Oh well.
[37:35.64]No, no Geoguessr.
[37:36.64]I'm not gonna play Geoguessr.
[37:52.10]I should have just fucking thought.
[37:53.12]I should have just bought Breath of the fucking Wild.
[37:56.82]I'm going to buy it right now.
[38:08.97]Don't look at the screen.
[38:31.87]Where is it?
[38:32.23]Oh, this is gonna take a long time to download, nevermind.
[38:46.93]Buy it anyways?
[38:47.55]I'm gonna buy it, don't worry.
[38:48.81]This is gonna take like three hours to download.
[39:00.93]Just buy it in store?
[39:02.22]I could do that.
[39:06.94]Well.
[39:10.68]Hold on.
[39:11.07]Alright, let me go piss.
[39:13.51]I'll be right back.
[39:16.73]Let me BRB.
[40:10.81]Eh?
[41:37.61]alright so I'm probably just gonna go I got so much shit to do that like it's just I probably should just leave I was I was hoping I could get like a couple hours in in the middle of all this bullshit not the stream I'm talking about like the house stuff
[42:06.49]And I was already tilted before the stream started.
[42:08.91]So, you know, you gotta admit defeat sometimes.
[42:26.17]Big bits.
[42:27.75]Holy shit, I did.
[42:29.75]Thank you, BasicFeral, so much for $50.
[42:31.11]50 bucks.
[42:36.60]Thank you.
[42:37.38]Sorry that we're ending the stream here, but... I just got too much shit to do.
[42:43.10]Like, I took a break from doing the painting to come down and try to get a few hours in.
[42:49.31]And you would not believe how fucking painful it is to sell a house.
[42:54.31]And have to move across the country.
[42:56.16]It has been, like, painful.
[42:59.06]So... And, on top of all the bullshit that I've had to deal with, like the roof leaking...
[43:04.57]It's been a pain in the ass.
[43:06.43]So... Just know... Sorry that we're having a short one today.
[43:12.27]Wrong screen.
[43:17.58]Oh shit, sorry.
[43:22.84]We'll go back to normal on Thursday.
[43:29.84]We're probably going to do something fun on Thursday.
[43:32.47]And by fun... I'm going to... I have like fruity loops.
[43:37.71]I have a bunch of song generators.
[43:40.71]And I'm going to write a bunch of songs and we're going to make music on stream.
[43:49.66]So that should be fun.
[43:55.54]Anyway, sorry for the short...
[43:59.53]abrupt kind of annoyed stream that I'm giving you right now not my intention but my brain is just racked with too many things so I am going to do the credits though and we'll stick around and hang out and talk for a little bit blame it on Mario aces well I mean let's be real blame it on the first game
[44:26.29]We weren't we Mario aces was just a catalyst to like this whole day being stressful Morphe's law hater But anyways, thank you for coming regardless Thanks for sticking around for the two hours or so we've been streaming
[44:57.84]I'll see you on Thursday for a music-making stream.
[45:10.55]Why don't you try this game called Mario Aces?
[45:15.49]That game's not even bad.
[45:16.69]It's fine.
[45:17.27]The game's fun.
[45:20.43]I'm just all twisted.
[45:26.07]But anywho, here are the credits.
[45:34.87]I gotta go in and fix this.

[51:27.35]Are you complaining?
[51:28.11]No, no.
[51:28.45]I'm just... I'm curious as to why.
[51:30.81]Usually it goes way faster.
[51:32.03]I thought there was only going to be like a handful of subs.
[51:34.31]I'm surprised there are this many subs.
[51:37.06]Norstor and Dr. Olim or Drolim me.
[51:41.18]Drolim.
[51:44.86]Um... Sorry to all of you guys that subbed.

[51:52.08]Um...
[51:55.01]Sorry, the stream wasn't better.
[52:03.24]But yeah, so I'm apologizing to the people that paid money to this stream.
[52:15.13]I want a refund.
[52:19.63]Yeah.
[52:21.35]I had this like inkling in the back, cause I knew this stream was gonna be short.
[52:25.50]Because I have, I'm going to turn the stream off and I'm going back upstairs to finish painting.
[52:30.28]And then there's a couple people coming over to look at the house and it needs to be ready to be seen.
[52:34.39]And if they, you know, people are going to want to start to buy it.
[52:38.53]My head's not in the game.
[52:39.43]Let's put it that way.
[52:40.25]Not this week.
[52:41.23]And not like next week either.
[52:44.49]So.
[52:46.85]Sorry that my, sorry that my head's not in the game tonight.
[52:50.61]Or, you know, yesterday.
[52:53.79]Or tomorrow.
[52:58.55]I can't let the stress of this move and this house bleed onto the stream.
[53:04.11]So I really don't want that to happen.
[53:05.69]And it started to happen tonight.
[53:06.95]So at that point, I kind of just need to go.
[53:09.67]You know what I mean?
[53:20.62]So thank you again, everybody, for subbing.
[53:23.36]See you on Thursday.
[53:25.42]Thursday should be a lot of fun.
[53:27.90]I'm looking forward to Thursday's stream.
[53:32.83]And with that, let's do the bits.
[53:35.09]Start from a couple hours ago.
[53:36.35]Oh, I gotta go.
[53:41.29]I gotta get out of here.
[53:42.41]I gotta go.
[53:44.30]God.
[53:46.48]What's Thursday?
[53:47.00]Thursday we're making music on stream with Fruity Loops Garage Band type stuff.
[53:53.16]I have an auto-tune I'm going to sing.
[53:58.45]By the way, some of these are going to be randomly generated lyrics.
[54:04.21]Should be interesting.
[54:15.67]So bring your headphones, bring expensive headphones on Thursday's stream.
[54:21.37]Can the lyrics be posted in chat?
[54:24.37]Well, they're not made yet.
[54:26.37]There's random lyric generators online I'm using.
[54:31.39]But let's start back here with the bits.
[54:40.82]Thank you to Peter for the $1.
[54:45.43]great stream this is a couple hours ago um thank you sorry it was short and sorry it ended with me having to just leave but I know my own personality very well thank you though sticks renegade thanks for the dollar 17 since we both have ibd colitis crones
[55:12.99]I'm sure you had fair share of bathroom troubles.
[55:15.15]Explain your worst one.
[55:18.05]Once I was in the bathroom for one and a half hours and was aching for a good one to two days.
[55:22.41]The worst ever experience I've ever had was I was on an airplane.
[55:25.22]I was coming back from PAX Prime.
[55:28.22]One of the first times I went out there.
[55:31.46]On the trip back, it's a six hour plane ride.
[55:36.99]That was actually hell.
[55:39.50]Because it's so horrible to have to go to the bathroom on an airplane.
[55:43.33]Especially when you have to go that often and you have that much pain.
[55:47.11]No, it sucked.
[55:48.29]That was the worst experience I've ever had with colitis.
[55:53.37]You know, there's people sitting around you and you have to keep getting up.
[55:57.36]I tried to just hold it for a while just because you just don't want to do that shit.
[56:01.24]That was the worst ever.
[56:05.14]So, Styx, I feel you.
[56:09.97]It's not fun.
[56:15.16]But that is the worst, though.
[56:16.22]That's probably the worst I've ever had to deal with it.
[56:18.72]Usually it's pretty manageable.
[56:22.20]But thank you, Styx.
[56:23.46]Sorry to hear about that you also have it.
[56:24.68]It's not fun.
[56:28.09]Marvash Magali, thanks for the $1.
[56:29.89]Hey, Handsome, thanks for the stream.
[56:31.09]I made this.
[56:31.71]Let's see what it is.
[56:40.08]What a lovely game.
[56:43.94]Commenting meme.
[56:45.92]You know, you're not that far off.
[56:48.94]KillGannon, thanks for the $1.
[56:50.22]This is my real phone number.
[56:52.46]I'm not going to say a phone number, but thank you, KillGannon.
[56:55.11]KillCode, thanks for the $1.
[56:56.37]BRB Jerma, got to do my chores.
[56:57.79]Yeah, I do too.
[57:02.41]I'll be doing them with you until probably like 2 o'clock in the morning tonight.
[57:09.37]Snooze and Copter, thanks to the $1.
[57:10.87]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[57:11.81]Jeremy here with Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[57:15.00]And tonight, I'm going to be playing as the Scout with the default Scout, a gun, the pistol, and the Boston Basher.
[57:19.06]This is kind of a different video today because I'm moving.
[57:21.84]Yes, that's right.
[57:22.90]I'm finally moving to Vegas.
[57:24.96]It's been a lot of month.
[57:27.41]It's been a long month with many issues that make making videos difficult how you probably all noticed.
[57:34.51]But this is going to change soon.
[57:39.03]Yeah, that's pretty accurate for like a TF2 gameplay parody sentence.
[57:48.79]Thank you, Sneezincopter.
[57:51.07]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[57:52.19]Hey there, it's me.
[57:53.07]As you probably know, I'm moving to Las Vegas, so the streams will be inconsistent.
[57:56.83]You may see something here and there, but bear with me in the meantime.
[57:59.27]Kappa.
[58:01.87]little almond thanks for the two bucks hey there I'm not available to stream right now but because I'm currently moving to Las Vegas over the next month or so you're going to see some streams sporadically it's going to be tough so bear with me as I relocate to Las Vegas oh why you guys you just wrote you transcribed it thank you surfing line for the one dollar hey Jerma Jeremy here maybe you're gonna be gone additional weeks after the move because you hate the viewers don't forget that
[58:32.36]a demonic cucumber thanks for the one dollar Jeremy uh exclamation point Vegas will only work if the people using it already know where you're going why not change it to info or update FailFish um yeah I mean I guess it could be either either one of them could do it you can have it programmed to be either one why would you just write exclamation point Vegas
[59:02.90]You know, I really like that play, so I'm going to just write it in chat right now.
[59:10.16]Yeah, we can figure it out.
[59:12.00]But thanks, though, man.
[59:12.66]Thank you, Jamie2803 for the five bucks.
[59:17.12]R.I.P.
[59:18.08]Stefan Carl Stefansson, a.k.a.
[59:20.22]Robbie Rotten.
[59:23.99]No, wait, hold on.
[59:34.18]Oh, shit.
[59:40.97]That sucks.
[59:54.16]I remember when he did the... He had that video that him and the other guys in the show, they kind of did like a little rendition of that We Are Number One song.
[60:05.27]Yeah, he died.
[60:11.16]It's terrible.
[60:14.70]From everything that I heard and read and saw about him, he was a great fucking person.
[60:21.00]Just wanted to make people happy.
[60:22.19]Wanted to make people laugh.
[60:23.43]Wanted to make people just have a good time.
[60:29.91]That's too, too fucking bad.
[60:44.28]Well, yeah, that's not great news.
[60:53.67]Anybody know how long did he have cancer, right?
[61:00.78]Because I know he was still... When did they stop doing that show?
[61:06.76]couple of years yeah god damn two years he got rid of his social media to spend time with his family at least that at least that was possible you know but on that incredibly sad note
[61:35.52]We're going to move on but yeah, that's that's terrible news.
[61:38.51]Rest in peace to uh To stefan.
[61:41.91]Is it stefan right?
[61:44.01]Uh, how do you pronounce it?
[61:46.79]Yeah, you gotta go fund me too he fought it But thank you, uh jamie for the five dollars Sir feline, thank you for the one dollar
[62:02.65]This is literally a game about creating the big head joke mode from other games.
[62:09.69]Yeah.
[62:11.93]Hey Lazy Luke, thanks for the $1.
[62:13.19]Hey Jerma, I made a webpage that can show most of the recent bits and subs from your channel in the hope that it would help you out when your stream crashes or you make a joke stream that ends without credits like Waterpark and Polygraph.
[62:27.14]I can make any changes to it that you want, including making it private link only or deleting the whole thing if you don't like it.
[62:31.85]Oh, Jesus.
[62:33.47]But I'd be happy if you could check it out and tell me what you think.
[62:39.74]Absolutely.
[62:40.28]Do you have a Discord?
[62:45.08]Are you on Discord?
[62:46.74]I think that's a better place to do it.
[63:01.44]um wait what um does that mean no no if you're on Discord then we could actually chat the link is yeah I mean the link isn't the message but if you're talking about things to change and things that I'd like to have done to it or something then that's a much better platform to talk
[63:39.12]I mean, if you don't like it.
[63:41.90]Oh, well, it's not... Yeah, I'll take a look at it.
[63:45.29]Don't worry.
[63:49.79]Let's see.
[63:57.06]Just go on Discord.
[64:01.96]I'll take a look.
[64:02.70]I'll think about it.
[64:03.52]No, no.
[64:05.00]It's just easier to communicate with people like off stream and stuff rather than like, because if I don't have like you on Discord or something, then, you know, like it'd be like, hey, time for the stream.
[64:14.51]The stream's on.
[64:15.17]Where's Lacey Luke?
[64:15.91]Hey, is he in here?

[64:17.88]Hey, here's what I want changed.
[64:37.99]play TF2 one hour straight yeah we had to stop I got a lot of to do and we hit a wall where I kind of just was losing my mind and too much going on that I just I gotta get this done it's just once I get this goddamn off my shoulders and I can finally just relax this week has just been absolute nonsense
[65:15.76]right so let's see Jerma985 is bits and subs this page can show you most bits and subs from Jerma advice Twitch channel it will probably miss some but it's better than nothing simply type in a time frame of up to seven days let's see let's just do like five days oh wow this is actually pretty awesome
[65:45.84]No, this is actually great, because if a stream does turn off, it's right here.
[65:51.00]That's really nice, man.
[66:14.59]Have I eaten?
[66:15.39]Uh, not yet.
[66:16.69]Not really.
[66:17.11]Oh, we crashed?
[66:20.33]Oh, shit.
[66:23.23]The hug of death.
[66:26.74]Well, I can use that, so... Thank you for making that.
[66:31.50]That's fucking awesome, Lazy Luke.
[66:44.11]That seems to solve that problem.
[66:50.08]You're dumb?
[66:52.44]Wait, why am I dumb?
[66:55.64]What happened?
[67:00.09]Why am I dumb?
[67:00.69]Do I have anything planned for Friday?
[67:07.59]There are a couple things that I'd like to do.
[67:12.59]Just can't do anything until all this shit is done with the house.
[67:21.86]But, Lazy Luke, I will use that.
[67:24.84]I'm going to bookmark that page.
[67:26.36]Thank you for making that, man.
[67:29.53]Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the one dollar.
[67:37.61]Stream showing the people around the house with your hidden cameras.
[67:43.55]God, that would be so creepy.
[67:47.85]Don't be too hard on yourself.
[67:52.80]No, it's not even that.
[67:54.08]It's just like, I told you guys this before.
[67:55.38]I don't want to be like a fucking pissy little dick on stream.
[67:59.90]I don't want to be like that.
[68:02.92]I don't want to just turn the stream on and like, oh, whatever.
[68:07.77]I'm just playing this.
[68:08.53]Who fucking cares?
[68:09.37]I'll see you later.
[68:10.03]I'm just going to play this.
[68:11.49]Who cares?
[68:12.25]I don't want to be like that.
[68:23.29]I don't want to have like an attitude problem for my stream.
[68:30.05]Because I don't like feeling like that.
[68:31.45]I hate that feeling.
[68:42.06]And it comes off as just an asshole.
[68:46.06]You know what I mean?
[68:50.18]I don't want to come off that way.
[68:51.20]I don't want to act like that.
[68:54.53]And I know why I'm feeling like that now.
[68:56.45]Some of you guys are like, Colin, dude, you're overreacting.
[68:59.67]What the fuck are you talking about?
[69:00.55]It was fine.
[69:02.47]It's like internal.
[69:03.35]You know what I mean?
[69:03.99]It's not necessarily like an external thing that you guys necessarily even see or hear.
[69:13.78]But I want each one of these streams to be fun.
[69:16.75]And if I'm not having fun because of certain things that are happening, that it pisses me off.
[69:25.26]And then that fucks with the stream.
[69:40.46]The stream is fine.
[69:41.30]Oh, no.
[69:41.62]I'm not talking about... I'm just making a general statement.
[69:45.36]Because then I start thinking about, oh, well, I had some stuff I wanted to plan for the stream.
[70:02.67]I had some stuff I wanted to do.
[70:04.78]I can't do it.
[70:06.86]Why can't you do it?
[70:07.56]Well, because I have to do all this shit.
[70:09.44]Why can't you do that stuff later?
[70:10.74]Because I have to sell my house.
[70:15.24]There's like a compiling of stuff that lays on top of each other.
[70:21.20]Of shit that I have to think about.
[70:24.62]So, why'd the turtle cross the road?
[70:27.44]To get to the shell station.
[70:38.87]pretty good that's pretty good oh my god he's he's gonna cry on stream no just no before we move on here that I I don't I take it very seriously
[71:09.79]I take making sure that we all have a good time seriously.
[71:14.73]And it pisses me off when it doesn't happen.
[71:20.06]So.
[71:22.90]He's just gonna start crying.
[71:25.70]What the fuck?
[71:33.25]So if you know that.
[71:35.59]Anywho.
[71:40.14]uh thank you the reaper of beams to the one dollar top 100 streamer plays bottom 100 game bake me home thanks for the five dollars uh Jerma no matter what don't go don't shoot anybody what are you talking about back in when we were playing
[72:10.33]Yeah, that's pretty great advice.
[72:12.77]Don't hurt anybody.
[72:13.59]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[72:15.27]Nobody should do that.
[72:23.43]I think you meant more of a general rule.
[72:24.93]I think so.
[72:33.10]Thank you, Bake Me Home.
[72:36.56]Thank you, Reaper of Memes for the $1.
[72:37.72]You already said that.
[72:41.24]Smelly boy, thanks for the one dollar.
[72:42.92]Please explain to me slowly why you bought Mario Tennis over Breath of the Wild.
[72:46.22]And I do mean slowly.
[72:49.14]Agonizingly slow.
[72:50.46]Because I don't know.
[72:51.54]Because me and Kim wanted to play a game together and it was just the one that was there that, oh, let's play tennis.
[73:01.41]And then that's the catalyst that turned into... That was too fast?
[73:06.01]Oh, shit.
[73:06.17]Oh, sorry.
[73:06.89]Sorry.
[73:13.42]again slower thank you garfield the Monday killer for the one dollar I just started up doing some cool tune college stuff man enjoy the comic as I get to my mermaid man math class mermaid man math class now let's see here's the garfield comic for today
[73:44.83]Don't blame Kim.
[73:45.89]What do you mean blame Kim?
[73:46.97]I said you can't play Breath of the Wild together two player.
[73:49.73]Where did you find the brain?
[73:54.37]Nermal at a garage sale.
[73:57.17]My house is infested with wasps.
[73:59.13]My nifty new Jerma wasp cosplay will get rid of those pests.
[74:03.31]Think about eating, going on a diet.
[74:05.93]It's not a bad idea.
[74:07.42]Wait till he lands.
[74:08.68]Oh, he's up in smoke.
[74:09.64]It's Odie.
[74:15.56]Thank you.
[74:16.70]Garfield the Monday Killer.
[74:19.02]Killcoat, thank you for the $1.
[74:20.54]Okay, I'm back.
[74:22.08]Welcome back.
[74:24.83]Demonic Cucumber, thanks for the $1.
[74:25.89]Does anyone else think that Jerma Payne looks a lot like Dennis from Always Sunny in Philadelphia?
[74:31.13]Actually, Jerma himself is like all the characters in that show.
[74:34.42]He's got Dennis' face, the fashion of Mac, with shirts with the arms cut off, the unique IQ and easy of Charlie, and the enthusiasm of Danny DeVito.
[74:47.78]I mean, it's a good show.
[75:00.22]Thank you.
[75:00.94]Scripps3 gave $50 during the middle of my fucking Mario meltdown.
[75:06.42]Thank you so much, man.
[75:12.59]Really appreciate it.
[75:15.91]Gooden, thank you, Gooden, for the $1.
[75:17.39]With all these disappointing new releases, Oblivion is always there to keep you warm, jermaFireman.
[75:22.25]That's true.
[75:24.32]Hey, Peter, thanks for the $3.
[75:25.56]CoolGuy, anonymous donation.
[75:28.38]CoolGuy.
[75:32.61]Hey Kvas, Kvas Blackthorn, thank you for the dollify, one of our mods.
[75:37.59]Hey Jeremiah, I swear I sit here for 20 minutes trying to think of something to say.
[75:40.89]I guess I'll just say I'm honored to moderate for you and it really is a dream come true.
[75:45.87]How about a community that I hold so dear that has helped me so much is the best feeling in the world.
[75:50.27]Expect more donations because I plan to get a job soon.
[75:54.16]Anyway, love you, you're the best.
[75:55.50]Jeremiah985 forever.
[75:59.54]I appreciate the dollar here.
[76:02.70]fast but you don't you do not have to pay me money you're already doing giving up your time as a volunteer here to mod this channel you don't have to pay me money you're doing me such a service thank you so much man mod him should I mod him should I mod this guy
[76:32.96]Alright, I'll mod him.
[76:40.43]Yeah, I just did it.
[76:44.75]Mod me too.
[76:52.12]But thank you, man.
[76:53.04]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.00.
[76:57.23]I swear to dog, Jeremy, if you went out and bought a bunch of games for your Switch and didn't get Mario Goes to the Public Swimming Pool or Legend of Zelda Whiff of Griffinsteed, I'm gonna be mad.
[77:06.18]I don't have either of those two games, I'm sorry.
[77:11.34]Dr. Clay thanks for the $1.
[77:14.50]Mario Tennis on the Switch was a big disappointment for me.
[77:16.51]They don't even have the fun item battle mode.
[77:19.43]That is literally like if they made a Mario Kart without a battle mode.
[77:23.50]If you want a good Mario Tennis game, play either the N64 or one of the GameCube ones.
[77:28.70]It's sad, I'm sure people worked hard on the game, but in all fairness, Mario Tennis Aces just makes me wish I was playing the other ones.
[77:34.80]Perhaps it was because Nintendo was focusing on Smash.
[77:40.94]I could see that.
[77:43.66]And they added a parry for some reason.
[77:47.85]That wasn't in the other one.
[77:48.53]I remember there being that weird parry system.
[77:51.91]Where your racket breaks and you die.
[77:54.77]Was that in the other games?
[78:03.13]No, it wasn't.
[78:05.08]Weird.
[78:08.88]Um... Thank you, Demonic Cucumber, for the $1.
[78:11.74]Hey, Jermo, if you were in the room with a... Uh... I'm not gonna read this.
[78:18.54]This is, like, fucked up.
[78:20.54]I'm not gonna read this one.
[78:25.54]Why would you write this?
[78:28.23]Why would you write all this?
[78:31.39]No, I'm not reading that out loud.
[78:40.70]I'm not going to read it.
[78:42.58]I'm not going to copy and paste this.
[78:45.10]I don't want this saved in my copy-paste backlog.
[78:58.91]Summarize it.
[79:00.05]No, I'm washing my hands in the sink here.
[79:12.39]I was quoting someone's question?
[79:15.99]What do you mean?
[79:16.99]Oh, you were quoting someone's question.
[79:24.78]Why?
[79:25.56]Why would you... Why does that person want to know that so bad?
[79:29.46]That's like... That's so over the top and just doesn't make any sense.
[79:34.20]Why does... Why do you need to know that information?
[79:40.53]What do you gain from that knowledge?
[79:42.21]I don't know what you gain from that.
[79:52.05]Anyways, thank you Demonic Cucumber for the one dollar.
[79:55.93]Asian Turtle, thanks for the $1.
[79:57.17]Imagine playing in Wimbledon and someone just pulls out a bunch of dumb stars to help hit the ball and it comes flying at you at 300 miles per hour.
[80:04.39]Then you find out that your next opponent is a goddamn 10-foot dragon turtle thing with spikes on its back.
[80:11.64]Thank you, Casey, for the $1.
[80:13.94]You should play Mario Kart 8 with subs.
[80:15.68]You can create online tournaments.
[80:18.84]That might be fun.
[80:21.95]That would actually be pretty fun.
[80:29.12]Will you ever stream any of the big games like God of War, The Last of Us, or Doom?
[80:33.28]I streamed Doom a couple times when it first came out.
[80:37.79]But not since then.
[80:41.07]I really should play God of War, shouldn't I?
[80:44.65]I've been told it's one of the best games ever.
[80:47.28]I should play it.
[80:56.12]Yes, you should.
[81:02.03]think it's good but not the best it's very good interactive movie a lot of great things are coming out soon but thank you kill again for the one dollar I'm fine said the man who was most obviously not fine I'm not gonna let it affect me I'm not gonna let it affect me you know if you say the same thing five times it means it's true right
[81:26.74]it doesn't affect me stupid you think I'm gonna lose wait somebody have a clip of me saying that you think I'm gonna lose sleep over Mario tennis like I give a now take that statement out of context right imagine hearing somebody say that out loud imagine somebody very mad on a cell phone you're on the subway
[81:51.11]You're coming home, you're like commuting back from the city or something, and there's a guy four seats down on a phone talking to somebody, saying that.
[81:58.45]Wait, you think I'm gonna be, you don't see, I'm fine.
[82:00.32]You think I'm gonna be that fucking mad about Mario Tennis?
[82:03.24]Being bad at Mario Tennis?
[82:04.60]I'm not gonna lose sleep over it.
[82:06.94]You'd be like, holy shit, dude, this guy's fucking crazy.
[82:12.33]With a briefcase and a suit on.
[82:30.50]I can't believe Mario Tennis, like, fucked me up for the rest of the night.
[82:36.85]Of all the things.
[82:42.81]There's so many more things to be upset about than fucking Mario Tennis.
[82:57.45]Ugh.
[82:58.85]Because I was thinking about going, playing, it was really getting me there.
[83:03.63]Yes, I've had a very stressful day.
[83:05.01]I've had a very stressful few days.
[83:06.29]I've been doing tons of work to the house, but man, just the fact that I kept thinking about the fact that like children were beating me.
[83:14.37]It was fucking mind infuriating.
[83:16.69]I was just thinking about like everyone looking at the, I was looking at the chat and everybody's like, oh, this kid's like fucking eight.
[83:22.78]You can't even beat a child.
[83:24.28]And I'm just like, I can't even beat a fucking child.
[83:26.16]Like no fucking way.
[83:32.00]Keep replaying over and over again in my head that an eight-year-old was schooling me in front of 3,000 people.
[83:42.88]And it was turning me into dust.
[84:06.04]Ay-yi-yi.
[84:09.70]Didn't you beat adults in a video game contest as a kid?
[84:13.26]Yeah, but it's different.
[84:14.54]There wasn't 3,000 people watching that guy lose to a nine-year-old.
[84:28.09]That guy's probably 28.
[84:29.05]Yeah, don't you guys know anything?
[84:34.22]It's not the kids that are playing those games.
[84:36.12]That was probably like a 35 year old man.
[84:54.43]Keep telling yourself that.
[85:00.49]That kid's not a top 1000 streamer.
[85:03.73]Maybe he should be.
[85:06.71]How long are you going to talk about Mario Tennis?
[85:08.59]As long as it takes me to fucking diarrhea this out of my system.
[85:15.52]I have to go to sleep tonight.
[85:16.98]I don't want to think about this at all.
[85:19.02]I don't want to think about...
[85:22.12]The fact that... I want to just delete the game.
[85:25.18]I want to take a fucking... Was that a bad game that came out that they pretended was a fun game and paid everybody to play it?
[85:32.25]That just came out?
[85:34.57]I don't want to take those pills, you know what I'm saying?
[85:36.45]I love how nobody knows what I'm talking about.
[85:51.45]There's so many.
[85:52.41]He's gonna play more tonight.
[86:11.64]Morphe's Law.
[86:12.68]No.
[86:16.20]You didn't give us enough clues.
[86:21.02]By the way, I just made a brash, probably completely untrue statement right there.
[86:28.39]This is what Mario Tennis Aces has done to me.
[86:39.96]Can't leave on a losing streak.
[86:43.36]Can't leave on a losing streak even if every game has been a loss.
[86:57.34]I'm uninstalling this on stream, and I did not install it.
[87:00.04]It won't be uninstalled.
[87:03.57]Play one more.
[87:04.23]No, I'm not going to play Mario Tennis.
[87:07.69]I can't do it.
[87:09.07]No, no, don't make me do that.
[88:02.00]I win.
[88:02.38]I beat him.
[88:20.63]I won.
[88:27.71]Get your ass kicked, buddy.
[88:34.52]That guy got beat so bad, his game couldn't even work.
[88:50.20]It's for the best.
[88:51.76]Thank you, BasicFeral, for the $50 earlier.
[88:54.42]Let me buy it for you.
[88:55.46]I will buy Breath of the Wild tonight.
[88:57.87]I promise.
[88:59.71]SirPixel, thanks for the $4, dude.
[89:01.49]Really appreciate it.
[89:04.41]DunkeyArisen, thanks for the $1.
[89:05.65]There are hundreds of great games on Switch, and you chose to play Mario Tennis Aces and the Luchador meme game.
[89:13.99]I told you.
[89:14.49]I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
[89:15.66]I told you.
[89:16.26]I was, like, smoking paint fumes upstairs.
[89:21.42]I told you.
[89:21.90]If I could do it all again, I would just play, like, Breath of the Wild.
[89:25.21]If I could do it all again.
[89:28.47]If we do it all again.
[89:44.93]That was a Muppets reference.
[89:45.95]Somebody got that.
[89:46.49]Nice.
[89:47.05]Good work.
[89:54.50]No, I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
[89:55.90]I should have just played Breath of the Wild and just relaxed and hung out.
[90:02.58]Instead of getting angry.
[90:07.38]And focusing too much on stuff out of my control in real life.
[90:14.78]Cheese grater on feet, you got it.
[90:25.24]Ow!
[90:26.76]God damn it!
[90:28.18]Ow, this hurts!
[90:30.00]Ow!
[90:30.50]Okay, I gotta stop doing that.
[90:47.28]He is under our complete control.
[90:52.70]But thank you, guys.
[90:54.02]Thank you, guys.
[90:54.58]Thank you, Dunkey, again.
[90:55.64]Thank you, Reaper500 for the $1.
[90:58.10]Hey, Jeremy, you said that you're going to play the new Spider-Man.
[91:01.06]Does it mean the next video on the main channel is another Spider-Man shitty Spider-Man update?
[91:05.31]It might be.
[91:09.47]Stanktron, thanks for the $1.
[91:10.65]Did you listen to the Now Now?
[91:12.89]Any of the good albums you've listened to recently?
[91:15.71]Love you.
[91:16.03]Hey, thanks, man.
[91:17.69]I have listened to the Now Now.
[91:19.57]It was good.
[91:22.97]The Now Now is kind of one of those... You just leave it on in the background.
[91:27.87]I found myself not paying attention to very many of the songs.
[91:34.71]Like, very many songs, I just kind of... They were just there.
[91:37.51]And they were interesting to be in the background.
[91:42.32]So it's bad.
[91:45.50]What?
[91:45.70]No.
[91:46.04]I just... I just wasn't paying, like, super complete attention to the whole album.
[91:51.46]A lot of them don't have lyrics.
[91:53.18]There's at least a handful of songs in that entire album that don't have lyrics.
[92:07.25]But, yeah.
[92:07.73]I thought it was good. ...
[92:17.30]Where Aces does pick up and succeed is in casual multiplayer, and specifically with younger players.
[92:22.46]With me having a good dollop of fun playing the game with my eight-year-old daughter, who was, it's confirmed eight years old played the game.
[92:29.49]Jeremy lost to an eight-year-old.
[92:38.73]I'm sure I did.
[92:41.86]Thank you, Demonic Cucumber for the five dollars.
[92:43.34]Hey Jeremy, no it's not much, but I really want to show my appreciation.
[92:46.24]I recently had been dealing with severe depression and OCD, which was pretty debilitating.
[92:51.53]However, even when I got sectioned and admitted to a ward, which was pretty casual, your streams and videos would get me through the day.
[93:03.31]It was the highlight of my day and brought so much relief to me in my time of crisis, words can't even describe.
[93:08.70]From the bottom of my heart, thank you, Jeremy.
[93:12.16]Thank you, for real.
[93:18.75]I hope you take care of yourself.
[93:19.67]I hope you start to figure it out, you know.
[93:29.03]One step at a time, get your life in the right direction, right?
[93:34.30]And I am absolutely fucking floored and honored that you have those things to say about me.
[93:42.92]So thank you so much, Demonic.
[93:46.84]wish you the best uh please please take care of yourself and then thank you dark star for the one dollar well Jerry I finally moved onto campus and my fellow dorm mates are cool dudes I will say the design is kind of weird two of the bedrooms open up into the bathroom so the toilet is actually walled off good good you got a walled off toilet that's good
[94:16.70]A little bit of privacy, man.
[94:20.00]But, good luck.
[94:22.34]You'll have fun.
[94:22.88]You'll like it.
[94:24.83]Just don't go crazy.
[94:25.57]2.9 GPA, right?
[94:28.95]3.0.
[94:29.33]If I play Dead Cells, I have not played Dead Cells.
[94:41.85]It does look pretty good.
[94:44.15]It looks like a pretty good game.
[94:49.61]But, um, thank you.
[94:52.95]Uh, thank you, Kristen, for the $1.
[94:54.21]Thank you for stopping at Morphe's Law when you did.
[94:56.95]Still better than Vampyr.
[94:58.11]Oh, man.
[95:01.37]Sometimes I pick them, don't I?
[95:04.85]But, Demonic Cucumber, thank you again for the $1.
[95:07.74]Also, jermaPluto is criminally underrated and underused, and we need a BBS emote.
[95:12.86]I've heard that, uh, before.
[95:14.26]I have heard that before, but more importantly, let's actually get it fucking going here.
[95:39.99]Thank you to DivUSP for the $1.
[95:42.27]Hey Jerma, don't worry about the short stream.
[95:47.34]I can only imagine how stressful that house selling... Imagine how... Hey Jerma, don't worry about the short stream.
[96:03.30]I can only imagine how stressful that selling your house can be.
[96:07.20]And the fact that you decided to stream despite all the stress and frustration you're currently going through truly means a lot and shows how dedicated you are as a content creator.
[96:14.70]Just do what you got to do.
[96:15.76]It's completely understandable.
[96:16.96]Hope everything works out.
[96:18.19]You got this.
[96:21.35]Div, there's a couple of important things that you need to know.
[96:27.13]And I've said it before, but I'm going to say it again.
[96:33.97]How do I word this?
[96:38.82]I get paid from you guys.
[96:43.68]You guys pay a lot of fucking money.
[96:47.86]A lot of it.
[96:51.17]I am so taken care of.
[96:55.71]And so blessed in, like, actually...
[97:01.21]By the many, many contributions that you guys have given me over the years.
[97:06.37]So... You're paying for this.
[97:12.25]Not all of you are, and none of you are ever expected to.
[97:17.63]But a lot of money comes through this stream.
[97:22.70]And... I don't take that lightly at all.
[97:26.68]So...
[97:28.63]If I'm going to receive the money, the amount of money, that I'm given on a daily basis while streaming here, then I had better try to give you the best possible shit that I can.
[97:45.13]And when that falls through, or when I have problems, it pisses me off.
[97:59.09]Because I think about... Just, oh, how much money did I get tonight?
[98:06.53]A ton.
[98:08.59]And I was just like a pissy little asshole for like an hour and 45 minutes.
[98:14.18]That's not cool.
[98:14.66]You know what I'm saying?
[98:26.43]It was pretty funny.
[98:27.25]I mean, it was pretty funny until I couldn't stream anymore.
[98:30.33]That's my point.
[98:31.51]Like, yes, it's funny when I, like, act like... I know that there's value there sometimes for, like, having... getting upset at something and, you know, it's funny, right?
[98:42.28]But I have to... I have to leave because, like, I just can't do it now.
[98:45.43]You know what I'm saying?
[98:57.83]And yeah, I can't promise that I'm gonna have... Oh my god, every stream is gonna be so fucking perfect, and everything's gonna go so well, it's gonna be so fucking funny and amazing.
[99:08.78]Because I know, I'm a... I know as well as anybody else, right?
[99:18.55]But...
[99:24.90]Every stream is... I did say that at the beginning in that voicemail, didn't I?
[99:35.59]But that point still stands and it always will stand.
[99:41.01]You guys contribute to the stream.
[99:42.33]You contribute to me being able to make videos and make streams and try to do things that I want to try.
[99:48.39]Play fun, interesting games that I think would be fun on stream.
[99:51.44]Try new things.
[99:53.02]Do little bits and sketches and shit.
[99:55.66]You guys allow me to do that, so I better hold it to a high regard.
[100:06.77]And I do appreciate the thoughts about the whole stress with the moving thing.
[100:11.75]Because that's on top of it, too.
[100:17.02]I have to deal with that, too.
[100:21.74]But I do appreciate it.
[100:25.22]Thank you, Stanktron, for the $1.
[100:26.97]I have used FL Studio a while now.
[100:29.75]And there are some insanely stupid pre-installed vocal samples.
[100:33.41]Just letting you know.
[100:35.13]And we're going to play with them.
[100:38.36]Dinosaurus Rex, thanks for the $1.
[100:39.72]Jerma, please, once you are done with the song, give the community a download link.
[100:42.78]I want to do some interesting things with them.
[100:44.38]Oh, I will.
[100:44.74]Don't worry.
[100:48.78]Thank you, Tin, for the $1.
[100:50.18]Take care of yourself.
[100:50.86]Much love.
[100:51.28]Thank you.
[100:51.62]Take care of yourself, too.
[100:54.73]It's Sweeney.
[100:55.33]Thanks for the $5.
[100:56.03]Jerma, what motivated you to go to Vegas?
[100:57.63]Did Comcast actually annoy you that much?
[101:02.24]Also, if Glue Man was in Overwatch, what would his ultimate be?
[101:06.44]Uh, he would fall down.
[101:07.34]He would just trip.
[101:08.90]And, like, hit his head on the ground.
[101:11.89]And, like, fucking his skull would bounce off the cement.
[101:18.57]And then he would be, like, an obstacle that you'd fall over.
[101:25.95]Uh, but Vegas, uh, just has everything.
[101:31.49]Vegas just has all the things I'm looking for.
[101:33.46]It's got all the... And it's an entertainment hub, and it's really close to LA.
[101:36.20]And it's... The cost of living is very cheap.
[101:40.98]I hope he practices FL Studio before streaming it.
[101:45.00]Oh, I'm not just using FL Studio.
[101:46.92]I got a bunch of random fucking programs.
[101:49.50]You guys don't even know what I might have here.
[101:52.54]For all you guys know, I might have like a baby DJ kit.
[101:55.66]That's like a toy.
[101:57.18]Who knows?
[101:58.05]I'm not gonna tell you that.
[102:03.92]I might have a bunch of weird fucking DJ toy things.
[102:21.46]Thomas the Tank Engine?
[102:22.68]No.
[102:24.87]Uh, but thank you.
[102:25.55]It's Sweeney.
[102:27.05]Thank you, Hawkeye, of mine, for the 350.
[102:28.11]Hey, Jerma, I've been a bit overworked and under-relaxed today, but coming home to your streams, yup, even this one makes it easy to chill and have a good time.
[102:37.12]I'm glad you feel that way.
[102:39.92]Because today was not a... I just hit myself right in the face with my headphones.
[102:46.44]I'm, like, just spinning them around and I hit myself right in the nose.
[102:48.64]Uh...
[102:53.19]But yes, today has not been a relaxing day for me.
[102:57.97]But even still, hopefully you can get some entertainment out of it.
[103:00.29]Thank you.
[103:01.67]And then Hawkeye of mine again for two bucks.
[103:03.47]Talking about Stefan and being so truly sorrowful about his passing really shows how genuine of a person you are.
[103:10.11]You can tell you know your morals and stand by them steadfast.
[103:12.83]You're a role model, bud.
[103:14.17]Keep on keeping on.
[103:18.39]I mean, I think most people would be truly saddened by that.
[103:27.48]You know, he was a really funny, really fun, talented guy.
[103:32.40]Of course, when you see somebody that... You know, the word I'm looking for here is mated, right?
[103:41.76]And you see just how much fun they're having.
[103:44.47]characters that they're allowed to create and the fun that they get to have on a daily basis, it's incredibly sad.
[104:00.88]Like he was, he had, he was a great character actor, right?
[104:05.27]Like that character Robbie Rotten was so animated and so interesting to watch.
[104:20.11]But yeah.
[104:26.22]Unfortunate.
[104:28.58]But thank you, Hawkeye.
[104:29.34]Thank you, Coconut, for the $1.
[104:31.26]Swear words.
[104:33.94]Thank you, Eefs, for the $2.45.
[104:35.16]Sir, if my god-awful bee ate it last night, I will never let that down.
[104:40.91]But I wanted to say that if you ever needed art for emotes or channel art, you should check out Worthy Kids on Twitter and YouTube.
[104:48.13]I think you'd like his style.
[104:50.65]He's done some stuff for Criken.
[104:51.95]Yeah, I mean, intro and emote-wise, I think we're okay for a little while.
[104:59.79]We just put 10 new ones in.
[105:03.51]So, in the emote and art department, I think we're okay for a little bit.
[105:12.88]Need more.
[105:16.02]More.
[105:18.16]Hey, it's time for slime.
[105:19.18]Thank you so much.
[105:21.10]for the $4.99.
[105:21.70]Hey, Jerma started animating this dumb joke before chat rioted for a game change.
[105:27.20]I feel you about the burnout, especially when you have so much going on.
[105:29.90]The stream was still a lot of fun.
[105:40.05]Streamer shoots.
[105:41.11]I'm doing like steroids.
[105:45.65]Jesus Christ.
[105:51.66]Thank you, Time for Slime.
[105:57.11]Yeah, for those of you guys that have moved across the country before, it just, everything else just can't be, your whole life turns into silly putty.
[106:17.07]Especially when you're the one that's essentially... When you're responsible for moving, right?
[106:24.55]When you're, like, directly responsible for, like, if you own a house or something.
[106:27.81]Like, I have to sell this house.
[106:30.95]Like, it's not as easy as just, oh, whatever, just go.
[106:36.28]It just sucks that I was a dumbass, like, five years ago.
[106:40.66]And, like, decided to buy a place instead of rent.
[106:45.08]That's what happened.
[106:49.98]You've moved countries and it sucks.
[106:51.78]I can't even imagine.
[106:57.57]I can't even imagine how horribly difficult that is to move across the country.
[107:02.95]Like, from country to country.
[107:04.41]Like, across not just the United States or not just, you know, going out of country.
[107:09.01]My goodness.
[107:12.22]Just leave the house there.
[107:13.82]Laughing my ass off.
[107:24.97]I don't understand what the problem is.
[107:26.19]Like you just leave the house.
[107:27.79]What do you mean you have to move the house?
[107:30.87]Just don't bring it.
[107:40.17]That was perfect.
[107:42.11]Thank you for that.
[107:42.81]That was amazing.
[107:47.31]Are we gonna get moving vlogs?
[107:49.03]You're gonna get moving streams.
[107:54.49]I'm gonna review foods in bed.
[108:01.29]Stream's gonna turn on for like two hours in the middle of moving and I'm going to review different macaroni and cheese brands.
[108:16.00]We'll do a thing maybe where I'll do it a few times.
[108:22.38]where in like Discord or something or we'll hey hey guess what bought that 400 poll service everybody could like get oh no what's your favorite potato chip what's your favorite mac and cheese and you guys collectively could give a bunch that I'd have to eat and we'll see who the real victor is you know what I mean
[108:53.56]Cracker Barrel, White Cheddar is superior.
[108:55.41]Well, that's what I'm saying.
[108:56.05]Like, you get enough people to vote for that.
[108:59.65]I'll do it.
[109:00.01]And I have to eat it all in bed.
[109:02.56]Or on the ground, because there might not be any furniture.
[109:19.49]What kind of songs am I making?
[109:22.05]Ones that I don't think very many people are going to want to listen to.
[109:27.23]It seemed like a fun stream idea.
[109:28.79]Just making metal.
[109:43.69]Don't be so humble.
[109:44.79]Everyone says that.
[109:52.65]I just can't wait to make the song that's 240 beats per second or whatever it is.
[109:58.19]Make an insanely high tempo song and try to sing to it.
[110:05.93]Layer it on, layer on different musical instruments.
[110:12.42]Speedcore.
[110:19.78]Will we interact?
[110:22.03]Yeah, we'll pick instruments, we'll pick genres.
[110:26.19]We'll do a thing where I do a poll and you guys pick the genre and the style.
[110:33.08]And I'll make the song.
[110:46.88]That sounds like a fucking amazing stream.
[110:50.04]Well, it might be, it might not be.
[110:53.14]We'll find out on Thursday.
[110:58.14]You know what?
[110:59.88]Maybe I should do that on Friday night.
[111:01.88]That seems like more of a Friday night stream, I think.
[111:05.34]What do you guys think?
[111:13.07]We'll do something else on Thursday.
[111:14.35]I'll get something else to do on Thursday.
[111:16.93]Friday night sounds more of
[111:19.13]You know, people can stay up.
[111:20.65]People don't have to work tomorrow.
[111:22.07]On the Saturday, you know what I mean?
[111:26.15]Will people be able to watch it?
[111:29.89]Yeah, that sounds better.
[111:30.77]We'll do it on Friday.
[111:36.33]Thursday, we'll... There's a couple things I wanted to get done.
[111:42.44]We'll have fun on Thursday, too.
[111:43.40]Don't worry.
[111:44.66]I'm not playing Mario Tennis ever again.
[111:47.48]But, thank you.
[111:49.51]Thank you to... The Reaper of Memes for the one dollar.
[111:53.83]I used to work on a boat as a deckhand.
[111:55.51]We would travel the world, find treasure, and go on adventures.
[111:58.57]We were only one week from retirement until we got locked in the sail in... In a walk-in... This is a walk-in oven joke.
[112:09.15]We got locked in the sail-in oven.
[112:18.12]thank you uh thank you dinosaurs rex for the one dollar also give me your favorite fan remix I'm bored and want to make some clone hero song I mean the the classic remix is that you know obviously the pirate song but you already had that uh favorite remix
[112:45.60]How about just wait?
[112:46.82]Just wait till Saturday, man.
[112:47.98]You're gonna have, like, ten songs to choose from.
[112:50.56]You'll have, like, at least a dozen potential options.
[113:08.54]I'm gonna try to make, like, twenty songs.
[113:10.78]Half of them are gonna be, like, twelve seconds long.
[113:16.23]Yeah, I gotta make a whole album.
[113:17.53]Don't you understand?
[113:18.19]We're making an album.
[113:23.33]An entire album is being made.
[113:37.34]Get it on Spotify.
[113:40.00]What's the album title?
[113:47.14]Uh... Cog rise.
[113:52.92]Cog rise.
[113:57.22]This is the best- This is the best- Somebody just reminded me- What?
[114:18.74]That's just a new emote.
[114:19.78]That's an emote for somebody's other... Someone else's channel.
[114:31.25]Yeah, I might even... I might even make... I might even... It's possible that I might even make and leak the Rat Movie... The new Rat Movie 3 sound.
[114:40.56]So... I've had it.
[114:42.86]It's ready.
[114:44.30]Might just make it.
[114:51.24]I ain't even thinking about it.
[115:01.49]That enough be lying?
[115:02.17]No, I got, I got, it's, I have, it's so simple, but it's so good.
[115:06.35]It's so good and simple.

[115:55.12]It's been a lot of fun.
[115:57.54]Hey, Tingy, thanks for the $1.
[115:58.78]Since some people asked about a few games, I'd like to know when you finish Metro Last Light before Exodus comes out.
[116:03.67]Yes.
[116:05.29]In fact, like a week before Exodus comes out, I'm going to play through Last Light to, like, get ready, right?
[116:14.42]So that's going to happen.
[116:18.70]Uh, G. Megan, thanks for the $1.
[116:20.75]Hey, Jerma, thanks for throwing those Mario Tennis games for me.
[116:22.95]I made some great balls going in the bedding.
[116:25.03]Here's your cut.
[116:25.67]Thanks for the $1.
[116:26.55]Appreciate it.
[116:28.35]Thank you, G. Megan.
[116:29.27]Thank you, Valken, for the $1.
[116:30.49]Hey, Jerma, I know you probably got a backlog of games to play on stream, but I'm going to recommend one anyways.
[116:35.35]RimWorld is a fun and unique colony simulator with a focus on individual members of the colony and their well-being.
[116:41.26]It can get slow or very challenging at times, but it's great.
[116:52.85]Played Mario Tennis for a hundred hours.
[116:54.41]Oh.
[116:57.59]Uh, Etalyx has a lot of RimWorld content.
[116:59.49]It looks like a really fun game.
[117:01.27]I'm just not really... I just don't... I don't do well in long simulation type games.
[117:09.82]I don't play Civilization.
[117:11.84]Just because I don't... Civilization's not necessarily long.
[117:15.79]But those kind of world sim games, I don't really play.
[117:23.21]Does it look like a good one, though?
[117:26.98]I just want to see you run a colony into the ground.
[117:35.40]Your 32-year-old brain is too old.
[117:38.66]Yeah?
[117:40.48]Or maybe too young.
[117:44.38]But thank you.
[117:46.66]Thank you, Fatoro, for the $1.
[117:48.24]Don't do this to yourself, Jeremy.
[117:51.81]Don't play...
[117:53.14]Mario aces hey raf mouse thanks for the one dollar when did you talk about spider-man I asked about it a couple streams back but missed bits afterwards are you going to play it on stream yes absolutely that game looks awesome thank you uh she xoxo for the one dollar appreciate it thank you it's weenie thanks for the five dollars hey Jerma with you singing muppets make me wonder
[118:19.81]Jerma musical on main channel when?
[118:21.71]Also, trying new Switch games are like playing Russian roulette except there's five bullets in the chamber.
[118:32.22]Jesus.
[118:35.64]Yeah, there was talk of making one a long time ago.
[118:43.83]Yes, let me get settled in Vegas.
[118:48.87]And...
[118:53.28]We'll see.
[118:55.94]Hey, Twitch Pyro, Twitchy Pyro, thanks for the one dollar.
[118:58.26]Missed the stream, but I hope there were plenty of walk-in oven memes.
[119:02.46]I was the oven tonight.
[119:06.34]I let the stress of moving and dealing with house problems get the better of me, and I let it bleed into the stream, and it was, uh, I'm a fucking, I take, I'll sit in the corner for the two minutes.
[119:17.95]I'm gonna go and time off.
[119:24.45]somebody walked into me but thank you twitchy pyro thank you Asian turtle for the one dollar don't feel too bad about the wicked short stream mate I know how difficult it is dealing with a wall dad house I just hope you remember to put a gun and knife before in every room before you sell also check out the game and anatomy it's wicked and short
[119:52.66]Like you, for real though, it's probably one of my favorite thriller games to play.
[119:55.76]Also, it's free, so you don't have to worry about breaking the bank.
[119:58.36]Peace out.
[119:58.70]Hey, that sounds good.
[120:01.72]Anatomy.
[120:06.77]I appreciate it.
[120:07.35]Thank you, Asian Turtle.
[120:10.83]It'll all be over soon, right?
[120:12.67]Like, it's...
[120:15.20]Only, like, another few weeks.
[120:17.06]Only, like, three, four more weeks total for this.
[120:21.91]And I'll be there, and it's over.
[120:24.85]Don't have to worry about it anymore.
[120:26.67]And then I can get to fucking work.
[120:31.63]Can't wait.
[120:35.58]Darkstar, thanks for the $1.
[120:36.82]Still in Anor, Boston.
[120:38.06]Streamer sucks.
[120:38.80]Can't get out of the housing economy, boss.
[120:42.25]Thank you, dude.
[120:42.81]Thank you, SmellyBoyForTheOneDollar.
[120:44.15]Do you like red letter media?
[120:47.55]Somebody else asked that like a week ago.
[120:49.07]And I said that I haven't really watched much of their content to be able to say anything about it.
[120:56.23]I have seen their Star Wars stuff.
[120:59.97]But besides that, I don't really keep up with what they do.
[121:11.11]But
[121:13.91]What's the move-in date?
[121:16.53]We're shooting for hopefully October 1st is what we're hoping to do.
[121:25.75]Might happen earlier than that, but that's like the kind of... It's going to happen by then.
[121:37.78]The whole month of September is going to be signing papers and getting...
[121:42.57]Some of these people are going to want better dates, right?
[121:47.31]Maybe September, maybe like September 12th, September 15th.
[121:50.85]It might happen.
[121:51.37]I have to be ready.
[121:58.21]Just adds to the stress.
[121:59.45]The unknown, right?
[122:09.62]Don't gamble the house away.
[122:12.58]December?
[122:13.20]Oh, God, no.
[122:18.26]Star is also moving.
[122:19.18]Yes, he is.
[122:19.65]Star is not moving to Vegas, though.
[122:27.03]But thank you, Clueless Sniper, at the end here for $1.
[122:29.61]Take care, Jerma.
[122:30.43]Jerma Hard.
[122:30.89]Thank you, man.
[122:33.45]We will reboot on Thursday here.
[122:37.84]Shake out the cobwebs and remove some of this bullshit.
[122:41.48]After tomorrow... I'm not gonna have a whole lot more to deal with in the house.
[122:51.01]So... That can go away.
[122:57.27]Look forward to it.
[123:00.23]And Demonic Cucumber, one more here for $1.
[123:02.36]Hey Jeremy, I had to quickly pitch in here and recommend the game Megaton Rainfall.
[123:05.82]It's a good stress reliever...
[123:07.86]And you play as Superman.
[123:10.05]I've heard some people have said that before, so.
[123:19.77]Megaton Rainfall.
[123:21.51]Superman Simulator.
[123:24.87]Just play Breath of the Wild on Thursday.
[123:28.32]I might, who knows.
[123:29.46]I need, I'm gonna need just like a relaxing stream on Thursday.
[123:37.37]The Sims might not be a bad idea.
[123:41.87]Should I just make, like, a bunch of fucking characters in Sims?
[123:44.64]I think we're gonna play The Sims 4 on Thursday.
[123:51.74]Yeah.
[123:52.44]Yeah, that's what we're doing.
[123:53.48]I need to relax.
[123:56.36]I just need to turn my brain off and just play and just relax and have fun.
[124:02.53]Sims 3 is better.
[124:09.67]Is Sims 3 better than Sims 4?
[124:21.90]Depends.
[124:22.36]They've removed pools in Sims 4.
[124:34.39]I think I made a couple of videos on Sims 3.
[124:40.87]Three is more content.
[124:44.09]Play Sims 3 with mods.
[124:52.78]We'll see.
[124:53.58]I'll gauge the... I'll go to the Discord and we'll... We'll find out which one I'm going to play.
[124:58.84]Because it's become very, very evident after tonight that... I'm like... I need to slow down.
[125:08.16]You know what I mean?
[125:13.98]Mario aces is enough to turn me into a goblin then I need to slow down a little until I'm done with this move but with that thank you everybody for watching really appreciate it sorry for the shorter stream tonight I'll see you on Thursday for The Sims
[125:42.15]We will relax.
[125:43.05]We'll go long on Thursday as well.
[125:44.67]I'll just chill and we'll play for like at least four or five hours at least.
[125:47.27]Take care, guys.
