[00:01.56]I am the rocket man they talk about.
[00:04.64]I jump from star to star, I walk it out.
[00:10.04]What's going on here?
[00:10.76]A little bingo?
[00:12.44]Grandpa, you might need to get in on this.
[00:14.55]Hey, here's your med kit.
[00:15.49]I don't understand.
[00:16.29]This is what Battlefield's about.
[00:19.39]This game, you just kind of sit around... Yeah, you kind of just... It's a lot of poker facing.
[00:23.67]Fuck you, buddy.
[00:25.85]Grandpa, you're wasting bullets, Grandpa.
[00:28.53]Now everyone's doing it, Grandpa.
[00:29.80]This is...
[00:31.63]Quit starting the trap.
[00:33.31]Will you guys get to fucking work?
[00:36.93]Now, we're just driving down this dirt road, so if you have any good stories, Grandpa, feel free to share them because, if you know, Battlefield 3 is pretty large.
[00:45.74]Yeah, this is crazy.
[00:47.42]You know, a little drive in the countryside, not a big deal.
[00:50.60]What is this pole?
[00:51.68]Is this a bungee jump pole?
[00:53.38]Grandpa, will you be offended if I run these guys over?
[00:55.89]Get him!
[00:56.43]Get him!
[00:57.81]That was dumb.
[00:58.61]That was the stupidest thing ever.
[00:59.89]He didn't even fall down.
[01:01.99]Spawn on me.
[01:03.60]Okay, this is your last chance.
[01:04.68]Alright, get in the jet.
[01:05.90]Try your hand at the jet, Goose.
[01:07.10]Alright, well, let's get in this thing.
[01:09.02]Yeah, you gotta press E. There you go, Grandpa.
[01:12.08]Do your thing.
[01:13.04]The jet, too?
[01:14.08]Nope, I'm watching.
[01:15.75]I'll critique you from the ground.
[01:18.57]So you're telling me if I pull up like this... Just pull up.
[01:21.15]It's inverted.
[01:22.29]Okay.
[01:22.79]Oh, there you go.
[01:24.55]Okay, Grandpa.
[01:26.01]Whoa, Grandpa.
[01:27.45]Pull up.
[01:27.99]Pull up.
[01:28.86]Oh, shit.
[01:30.38]What the fuck?
[01:32.88]I just have a question for you, like, honestly.
[01:35.16]Were you playing Call of Duty before this?
[01:37.96]What kind of question is that?
[01:40.44]You just seem, you know, very un-teamwork-based, just not objective-oriented.
[01:45.69]I don't know.
[01:46.17]I was the best Call of Duty player on planet Earth.
[01:48.39]I don't know if you knew that.
[01:51.67]There you go.
[01:54.57]Suppressing fire.
[01:55.43]Suppress those tanks.
[02:01.69]Holy shit, Grandpa.
[02:04.37]Oh, Grandpa, this is like Mario Kart.
[02:06.95]I don't know if you ever played it.
[02:08.11]Shoot those guys.
[02:12.71]I remember that one.
[02:14.65]You're like the clown with the flaming head.
[02:17.49]Oh, I think you're just overheated.
[02:25.70]Grandpa, you're getting them.
[02:28.04]Oh, Grandpa, you're amazing.
[02:32.20]Yes!
[02:33.18]I am the master!
[02:35.38]And you have a sick and twisted laugh.
[02:38.74]I love this.
[02:40.24]What's going on right now?
[02:42.74]What is... What is it?
[02:44.03]What is it?
[02:45.09]Oh, so what?
[02:45.59]Is this thing gonna... Oh, this is fantastic.
[02:49.25]So I have to ask you... What the fuck?!
[02:54.29]What just happened to this thing?
[03:02.37]Did you just break this thing?
[03:03.62]That was pretty cool.
