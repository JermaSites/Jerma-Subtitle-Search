[00:37.13]Beep-boop, beep-bop.
[00:38.31]Hype beaters reaching critical mass.
[00:40.17]Beep-boop.
[00:41.15]Beep-bop, beep-bop.
[00:42.19]Oh, fucking hype beaters reaching critical mass.
[00:47.01]I fucking hate that shit.
[00:49.10]Using that term unironically.
[00:51.68]I don't like it.
[00:52.22]But I'm excited.
[00:52.90]Hi, welcome.
[00:53.56]It's done.
[00:54.04]It's ready to fucking watch.
[00:54.92]It's ready to go.
[00:57.00]I spent a long time on this, obviously.
[01:00.30]I'm not going to pretend I spent a very, very long time, but long enough.
[01:03.20]Hopefully it's funny.
[01:06.03]Hopefully it's worth it.
[01:07.47]Hopefully it's fucking beep-boop, beep-bop, hype meter, reaching critical bass.
[01:13.37]Sound like I'm shit-faced?
[01:14.11]I promise you I'm not.
[01:16.97]Yet.
[01:19.69]Welcome to fucking Jermania 2007 fucking day.
[01:23.80]Stream edition.
[01:28.81]Uh, is it gonna be fun?
[01:31.06]But before, we're not gonna let go right into it yet.
[01:33.81]Not yet.
[01:37.76]Because last time I did this, this is only going to be like an hour and 45 minute stream.
[01:42.54]So don't expect this to be like a four plus hour live stream.
[01:48.80]We're going to do like an exhibition match.
[01:50.26]We're going to chill.
[01:50.76]We're going to talk.
[01:51.28]We're going to do the whole thing.
[01:53.02]And then that's it.
[01:54.68]There's nothing else planned after like the festivities here.
[01:57.38]So I'm going to do like maybe like an hour and a half to an hour and 45 minutes of like show.
[02:04.21]And then here we go.
[02:07.92]So, let's, uh, let's make a tweet.
[02:10.82]We're gonna start, we're not gonna do it yet, so if you're, like, you're thinking, this is very important, we're gonna, put the brakes, hold on, like, Jeremy, calm down, I'm, like, way too overexcited for this shit.
[02:21.69]Just chill out.
[02:24.79]So, how is this gonna work?
[02:25.77]Hey, let me turn this down.
[02:29.34]So, notifications are off.
[02:31.68]So if you're going to get bits or any subs or anything, they're not going to appear on screen.
[02:36.79]Just want to let you know.
[02:38.03]Just for YouTube purposes and for the stream overall, I'd rather have everybody just completely focus on what's happening.
[02:46.68]And, uh... It's... I'm gonna do an exhibition match first.
[02:52.11]This is not part of the festivities.
[02:54.23]This is just so... Because last time I did this, a lot of people were saying, Oh, well, Jerm, I wish you had waited a little bit.
[02:59.27]It was only like an hour and a half long stream.
[03:01.55]I got there fucking halfway through.
[03:02.83]I got there too late.
[03:04.13]So, we're not gonna start it yet.
[03:05.19]I'm gonna do an exhibition match first.
[03:07.61]We're gonna chill.
[03:08.65]We're gonna fucking go in the chill zone.
[03:10.49]Get the fucking nice large soda.
[03:12.49]And we're gonna go.
[03:13.99]So...
[03:15.21]Let's start that now.
[03:16.88]This is not part of it.
[03:18.22]I promise you.
[03:20.92]Let's move this down here.
[03:23.62]So here's, here's your opener.
[03:26.16]We're just doing, we're doing a straight up six man brawl.
[03:29.15]With characters, these characters are not in the coming festivities.
[03:32.99]And there are a bunch of others that aren't as well.
[03:36.69]Don't ask me why fucking James Madison made it on this.
[03:39.17]This is just like the, who cares, none of these people are fucking in it.
[03:44.00]So it don't matter.
[03:46.60]So let's just, like, get this going while, like... I'm gonna read bits and shit now.
[03:52.79]But not in a few minutes.
[03:55.59]In, like, 20 minutes it's getting turned off, so I'll turn it back on.
[03:58.91]Alright, here we go.
[04:00.73]I'm not... We're just gonna go.
[04:02.27]We're not gonna control it.
[04:03.11]This is loud, but it's okay.
[04:05.28]Six-man battle royale over-the-top mini royal rumble.
[04:12.26]Remember, none of this fucking matters.
[04:16.96]Yeah, these are the guys that got left out.
[04:23.69]But just because Bia882 is not in the Rumble, what do you think?
[04:26.33]There's no Bia in the Rumble at all?
[04:29.07]Come on.
[04:30.57]I'm fucking better than that.
[04:31.59]You know that.
[04:35.25]Thank you, Badabingitsben for the bits.
[04:38.13]Spritech as well.
[04:39.88]Go get him.
[04:40.52]Well, we will.
[04:43.18]Smokewiseganja, thanks for the $5.
[04:44.54]Destroy him.
[04:48.70]Yeah, Paul.
[04:49.18]Look, these are like old channel memes.
[04:52.98]You know what I mean?
[04:53.62]We don't talk about these.
[04:54.62]Like the Archmage?
[04:55.30]When was the last time I said Archmage?
[04:57.48]Orson Welles hasn't been a subsound for like two years.
[05:00.80]There's always a fucking beer.
[05:01.88]This is a default shit beer.
[05:03.38]James Madison doesn't even look like James Madison.
[05:05.38]I made him last minute last time because I needed a 30th character.
[05:08.16]Paul Bearer hasn't been a subsound in like a year.
[05:11.24]And like 47 is just a bald guy.
[05:13.98]This is the pre-show.
[05:15.83]This is not the main show.
[05:21.54]I forgot how long it takes to load these, by the way.
[05:26.80]But thank you, Stix- WHOA!
[05:28.14]We got fucking- Okay, hold on.
[05:31.74]Uh, Stix Renegade, first of all, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[05:33.73]Let's fucking go.
[05:34.59]Uh, you guys wonder why it takes so long to make these fucking games?
[05:39.79]To make these things?
[05:41.49]Because if you do any created content ever on any of these games...
[05:46.92]Yeah, good luck.
[05:48.30]Because, like, back in, like, WWE 2K14, wow, Jerma, how come you're not on 2K14?
[05:53.46]Because 2K17 sucks.
[05:54.46]I agree.
[05:54.97]2K17 is a piece of shit video game.
[05:56.65]It's a piece of crap.
[05:57.89]Ever since Visual Concepts, like, really took it over, it's been a pile of fucking garbage.
[06:01.59]The Creative Suite has been terrible.
[06:03.03]You can't make fucking monsters anymore.
[06:04.55]Anyways.
[06:05.98]Because in WW2K14, it takes, like, even to change somebody's fucking hairstyle, if you have a ton of created content and a ton of logos and a ton of paintwork on that character, it might take, like, 19 seconds to change somebody's hair.
[06:23.01]That's what we're working with.
[06:26.07]Throwing shade.
[06:26.75]That's not shade.
[06:27.33]That's the truth.
[06:29.07]That is the honest to God truth.
[06:30.83]After THQ went under, and THQ wasn't like the main force behind the game, the creation suite became kind of like an afterthought.
[06:41.10]It was just like, oh yeah, it's still cool, it's still really good, but you know, fuck it, who cares?
[06:47.08]You can't make monsters anymore.
[06:48.30]This is a serious fucking sports simulation.
[06:52.43]Alright, now after that long loading screen, and there's a lot of money.
[06:56.51]A ton of money.
[06:57.13]So while we see the entrances...
[06:59.11]Let's see here.
[06:59.61]Skater Dad.
[07:00.94]This is all turning off.
[07:01.76]I'm turning these fucking... No notifications when the real festivities start.
[07:07.15]Anyways, here's B.I.
[07:07.79]number 882 doing his fucking salute to the National Anthem.
[07:12.44]Alright, hold on.
[07:12.99]Wait, wait, wait.
[07:13.41]I'm supposed to be bringing bits.
[07:15.19]Alright.
[07:15.89]Skater Dad, thanks for the hundred fucking dollars.
[07:19.53]Can't stay the whole stream, but God bless you.
[07:21.29]Have fun.
[07:22.23]Well, the VOD will be available and this whole thing will be on second Jerma.
[07:28.26]Pretty much unedited, I would assume, with very slight editing to take out the loading screens, obviously.
[07:32.72]But it will be preserved in its entirety for the most part.
[07:35.64]Thank you, though, so much, dude.
[07:36.54]That's a hundred dollars.
[07:37.78]Thanks for stopping by.
[07:39.40]Buster Boy also thanks for the bits.
[07:41.68]Gary Gray, Jen betters for the bits as well.
[07:44.46]It better be good or I'm going to get a refund.
[07:47.62]Well, I can't guarantee that.
[07:50.73]But thank you, Gary.
[07:52.67]Jen, thank you as well.
[07:54.83]Do you know that Orson Welles voiced a Transformer?
[07:57.43]I did not.
[07:58.89]Sticks Renegade gave $10.
[08:01.53]Edgemont gave a dollar DJ DJ man DJ jembo man.
[08:06.03]I don't know.
[08:07.31]I don't think we've ever seen James Madison's intro No, we haven't we've never seen James Madison's intro well this guy fucking sucks I can't wait to I can't wait to never use this guy again That's gonna make me so happy
[08:33.33]He doesn't even look like James Madison.
[08:36.83]It's just a guy with a suit on and like dreadlocks.
[08:39.00]Why does he have dreadlocks?
[08:41.86]Alright.
[08:42.30]Alright, James.
[08:43.14]That's enough.
[08:43.56]You can fucking turn it down a little.
[08:47.50]Anyways.
[08:49.38]Thank you so much.
[08:49.92]KXZ501 gave $100 a few minutes ago.
[08:50.60]Thank you so much, KXZ.
[08:53.04]$100.
[08:53.12]They say rumble hype.
[09:02.76]This is, uh, remember Orson Welles is from hell apparently.
[09:05.10]Oh god, that's like kind of in bad taste.
[09:09.06]Isn't that, that's in bad taste, right?
[09:14.56]Uh, alright, but anyways, uh, KXE, a ton of money.
[09:18.10]Uh, I will try to spend it wisely.
[09:21.00]Thank you so much.
[09:23.30]Also on this list of people, Womp54 gave $15, so pumped.
[09:27.94]Alright, he's just fucking standing there.
[09:29.67]Can I skip his intro?
[09:33.97]This is another one that I think just doesn't... These are all the shit characters.
[09:36.77]Or someone else is a cool character, but he's a shit character too.
[09:40.33]Anyways, thank you so much, guys.
[09:42.51]A lot of money is coming in right now.
[09:46.89]I'm skipping him.
[09:47.71]That was way too fucking long.
[09:51.22]Wait, did I skip everyone?
[09:53.18]No.
[09:54.80]Or did I?
[09:56.76]Why is everybody standing outside?
[10:01.98]Is this, like, loading?
[10:03.54]I think the game's loading.
[10:04.42]That's why it's taking this long.
[10:05.92]Oh, there's Paul Bearer.
[10:07.60]We've seen this intro before.
[10:08.76]Uh, most of the last thanks for the $50.
[10:14.59]Not my 4,020th president.
[10:16.53]Thanks a lot, dude.
[10:17.81]Uh, BOM 10 bucks.
[10:18.99]Thanks a lot.
[10:19.53]Satan's Weed Whacker.
[10:21.41]Dubski dude, this is so... You guys are fucking too generous.
[10:29.22]Like, hopefully the stream is worth it, because this is a lot of fucking money.
[10:35.38]Alright, cool, Paul Bearer, we have seen him before, yep.
[10:42.39]Alright, who's next?
[10:44.15]People are booing the Archmage, of course.
[10:48.70]At Archmage.
[10:49.26]I don't think I, like, I didn't do any of that shit, by the way.
[10:52.20]Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah, we've seen him.
[10:54.20]It's new to me!
[10:55.08]Oh, it's new to you.
[10:55.74]Well, sorry, I'm, like, skipping everybody.
[10:58.96]With your... With your... Here you go, guys.
[11:01.72]Here's, like, the six-month-old channel memes.
[11:05.50]This is what this brawl is.
[11:08.86]Uh, another fucking hundred dollars.
[11:10.18]Did I see that?
[11:10.68]Did I see that correctly?
[11:12.36]Or is this, like, thing broken?
[11:14.68]Holy shit, like, my, like, Twitch alerts... That just scared the shit out of me.
[11:20.96]Remember the sorcery streams?
[11:24.47]I do.
[11:24.75]I do.
[11:26.98]Busterboy, thanks for the bits.
[11:28.76]Yeah, you guys have broken my Twitch alerts.
[11:33.02]Turn that, turn the ga- I'm just, the game volume was down just temporarily, so you could, uh, I could say hello to some people.
[11:38.89]Especially because I gave a lot of cash.
[11:40.69]So.
[11:42.39]Uh, let's go, that's 47.
[11:44.05]Uh, this is just to get people in here.
[11:47.29]Because I don't want to start the actual show before that.
[11:50.54]Here we go, it's a six-man rumble.
[11:52.76]Let's see what happens.
[11:54.47]Uh, automatically, the BIA887, whatever his name is, just stomping the shit out of Agent 47.
[12:00.51]Couple of reversals, oh, let's start shoutcasting this fucking terrible match.
[12:03.72]What?
[12:04.10]No, no, no.
[12:04.96]I'm gonna save my voice.
[12:07.52]Because that's gonna happen later.
[12:09.42]And I don't care about this.
[12:11.20]This is the joke match.
[12:14.40]I don't know, who do we, who do you guys want to win this?
[12:17.17]This, like, exhibition.
[12:20.47]I don't know.
[12:22.75]Like, does anybody care about any of these people?
[12:31.42]Yeah, so if you're just joining us, if you're coming in or you're trickling in, this is just a warm-up.
[12:37.42]None of these people are in the actual Rumble.
[12:39.34]Nobody's in it.
[12:40.62]That's in the screen right now.
[12:42.90]Archmage, I think, is gone.
[12:43.84]Archmage is gone.
[12:45.20]So, like, it's funny, like, the most done-up actual character is the first one to get eliminated here.
[12:52.13]Everybody else is just a guy.
[12:54.17]So, hey, which one of the regular guys?
[12:55.51]You know what?
[12:56.53]It's fair now.
[12:57.21]These are all regular guys.
[12:58.27]I mean, you could... Alright, James Madison just, like, broke his back.
[13:04.85]So, Agent 47 is the only guy that could be, like, strong.
[13:08.55]Maybe.
[13:10.31]Who knows?
[13:12.67]That's a nice, like, face... That's a nice, like, face stomp by James Madison.
[13:19.88]I put it on, like... I put the speed on fast.
[13:24.41]Are you watching on your TV as if it's pay-per-view?
[13:27.62]That's a pretty good way to do it.
[13:32.10]That's what I'd be doing.
[13:35.58]Like, you guys, you know it's like an elimination chamber.
[13:37.54]You just have to throw a guy over the top rope.
[13:38.98]It's like, come on.
[13:42.72]47.
[13:44.66]Yeah, don't worry.
[13:45.97]There are lots of secret characters this time.
[13:49.42]Even after you watch the whole thing, there are characters that are only in the Rumble.
[13:54.12]Fucking secret.
[13:54.74]Orson Welles is going to eliminate Paul Bearer, his former tag partner.
[13:58.76]Looks like he's going to go over.
[13:59.60]No, maybe not.
[14:01.82]So who, out of all the shitty memes... I can't even say that.
[14:06.42]James Madison's not a meme.
[14:09.04]Neither is Hitman.
[14:10.22]Hitman's just from a good video game.
[14:13.36]Game of the Year, last year, by the way.
[14:16.10]At least in my opinion.
[14:18.93]If all the serpents don't return, uh, no, there are no serpents.
[14:23.67]They're all gone.
[14:26.01]Last time we cheated, and there were seven entrants that were serpents.
[14:30.01]No fucking clones here, Sakurai.
[14:31.85]No clones here, Sakurai.
[14:33.99]Not happening again.
[14:35.41]You're not gonna get Fox, Falco, and Wolf.
[14:37.39]Nope.
[14:40.55]All original fucking, and nobody's the same.
[14:43.56]No fucking clones here, Sakurai.
[14:49.67]Fucking eliminated, please.
[14:52.51]This was only supposed to be, like, two minutes.
[15:03.66]Somebody got eliminated.
[15:04.58]Why did the Archmage get eliminated so quickly?
[15:07.68]And nobody else can do anything.
[15:09.74]Alright, finally.
[15:14.38]You know, it's possible a Biav might win a Rumble.
[15:18.79]I mean, this rumble doesn't count and is totally meaningless.
[15:23.39]But he still might win.
[15:24.27]Well, actually, I did guarantee that I would never win a rumble.
[15:29.80]I'm not sure if that's going to work.
[15:35.26]Going to the top rope?
[15:36.78]What the fuck is he doing?
[15:39.38]He's just standing there.
[15:40.50]Is he going to get down or is he going to taunt?
[15:43.45]That's a bad move.
[15:48.91]I love how they have the same animations as five years ago.
[15:52.79]Yeah, they got the same damn animations from five years ago, but they removed the awesome creation suite from five years ago.
[15:58.71]Somebody explain to me the logic there.
[16:02.42]Oh no, here he goes.
[16:04.66]How many cereal characters are there?
[16:05.90]There are no cereal characters.
[16:07.08]That don't mean there are no other food characters.
[16:16.43]Did he hit him in the hand?
[16:17.77]You see that he's like, oh shit, my hand!
[16:24.45]Fruit confirmed?
[16:25.53]That's not what I said.
[16:29.50]And now we're just doing move.
[16:33.50]They were trying to make the game more realistic.
[16:34.84]It was a mistake.
[16:35.38]I agree.
[16:35.72]I don't think... Sick moonsault by 47.
[16:39.68]I mean, I don't think a lot of people buy these games for like a sports simulation.
[16:46.62]I think they buy them to get drunk with their friends and make a bunch of dickheads.
[16:49.46]Like, come on.
[16:50.34]Like, who actually buys this to, like, play the wrestling game?
[16:55.41]I can't, I've never seen somebody do it.
[16:58.93]Everybody I've ever known, any friends, any relatives that have ever bought a wrestling game, they don't play the game.
[17:04.30]Guys, I have, I have like a fucking thousand hours in this game.
[17:10.22]I've not one time played this game.
[17:14.82]I've never had the controller in my hand moving the character in the ring.
[17:18.38]I've got like fucking at least like 7,000 hours in this game.
[17:22.44]That's a lie.
[17:24.06]But it's true.
[17:24.80]I have a ton of time in this game.
[17:26.46]I probably have like at least 1,000 hours in WW2K14.
[17:31.93]Have any... Yeah, I don't play these games.
[17:34.37]I make the computer plays them for me.
[17:35.65]7,000 hours.
[17:41.26]Alright, come on.
[17:41.94]Let's get to a close here.
[17:42.74]Let's start the real festivities.
[17:44.36]This is it.
[17:45.36]Down to the last three.
[17:46.81]Abiyah is going to win.
[17:47.75]It's going to happen.
[17:53.07]Abiyah is going to win.
[17:54.77]We can at least... No, he's not.
[17:56.99]He's going to get punched in the face.
[17:58.23]Has James Madison eliminated every single person?
[18:01.23]I think so.
[18:03.42]Yep.
[18:04.06]Okay.
[18:04.32]Well, James Madison has eliminated everyone.
[18:09.69]It's just James Madison versus everyone, apparently.
[18:13.24]No, he's gonna do the thing where he's like, I go over the ropes.
[18:15.96]You didn't see that coming.
[18:19.50]Powerbomb over the top, please.
[18:22.24]God damn it.
[18:26.66]Come on, over the top.
[18:27.96]Over the top.
[18:29.14]Why?
[18:29.50]You've had it.
[18:36.38]Ooh, nice crossbody there.
[18:41.77]What?
[18:44.35]Okay.
[18:45.19]I think they decided to stop wrestling.
[18:47.68]No.
[18:48.00]He was getting his breath.
[18:50.46]Get him over the top.
[18:51.54]Come on.
[18:52.58]Get him over the top ropes.
[18:55.16]No.
[18:55.40]That was just his special move.
[18:59.84]Alright.
[19:00.43]Get him out of here.
[19:01.21]Yeah.
[19:02.83]Good job, James Madison.
[19:03.77]You win.
[19:05.09]James Madison won.
[19:05.99]No.
[19:06.15]He let him up.
[19:06.67]Come on.
[19:07.03]What are you thinking?
[19:09.21]Can we get to the real fucking festivities, please?
[19:12.17]Just eliminate every single... Oh my god, he's so dumb.
[19:16.89]You are such a fucking idiot.
[19:19.56]How many opportunities do you have to flunk?
[19:23.32]There it is, another punch to the face.
[19:24.66]James Madison is your winner.
[19:26.08]Three, two, one.
[19:29.90]He eliminated every single person.
[19:34.25]Oh, he had a vendetta.
[19:40.19]Oh, let's see.
[19:40.78]Remember when James Madison did this?
[19:42.82]I do.
[19:43.56]Hey, remember when James Madison did that?
[19:45.55]Me too.
[19:45.87]Remember when James Madison punched that guy on the side of the ropes to win the meaningless rumble?
[19:53.42]Alright.
[19:54.68]Here we go.
[19:55.18]This is where it starts.

[21:08.33]Here we go.

[21:15.45]Wait, wait, wait.
[21:16.17]Why was there a baby head?
[21:21.70]Why is there no audio?
[21:27.71]This is my intro?
[21:33.73]Hey, welcome to Jermania Stream Edition 2017.
[21:35.55]It's just a floating, like, baby face.
[21:41.41]Alright.
[21:44.26]It looks like it's loading.
[21:45.40]This is the loading screen that I chose, apparently.
[21:54.73]Uh, can I skip this?
[21:56.17]I don't think I need to see this anymore.
[21:58.55]I can't skip this.
[22:00.57]I have to watch this.
[22:05.08]Hey, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Jerma Arena.
[22:09.92]You see these broken down cars?
[22:11.12]We're in Jeremy's backyard tonight.
[22:14.50]There's 60,000 people here watching in the arena.
[22:18.05]Please don't try this at home.
[22:19.47]Remember, it's very important.
[22:23.35]As you can see, we're in Arlington, Texas.
[22:25.75]Apparently, Jarvis lives in Arlington.
[22:28.91]Apparently, he lives in Arlington, Texas.
[22:30.83]That's fine.
[22:33.01]Just a second.
[22:33.67]Let's make sure nothing gets shown on the screen here.
[22:35.73]No!
[22:39.91]Don't look!
[22:41.33]Don't look!
[22:45.08]Okay, here we go.
[22:46.92]Here it comes.
[22:47.84]What the fuck?
[22:49.60]It did that last time, too.
[22:51.10]God damn it.
[22:58.14]Don't look.
[22:58.80]Nobody look at that.
[23:02.64]Don't look at it.
[23:03.28]Nobody look.
[23:07.49]Wait, why am I... I don't want to control the character.
[23:18.72]Okay, dude, seriously?
[23:20.34]That just threw me under the bus.
[23:25.15]And this is going to take so long.
[23:26.61]You know what?
[23:27.47]Who cares?
[23:27.93]There he is.
[23:31.01]I'd rather you see this than a BRB screen.
[23:36.35]I don't want to control this.
[23:37.71]Why would I be controlling this?
[23:43.28]Fucking 2K17 is a piece of shit.
[23:52.75]I had so long to prepare it.
[23:54.15]Well, listen.
[23:54.85]Like, I... I can't control it.
[23:57.33]The game, like, shoots itself back to the fucking menu.
[23:59.63]Alright, let's do it.
[24:02.64]Here it comes.
[24:08.06]Here he comes.
[24:10.48]Here comes Jerma.85 to fucking, like, explain why, like, 2K17 needs to load... have a loading screen for the ring and then go back to the menu and then load the screen to load this.
[24:29.09]put on a little weight.
[24:30.71]Not a big deal.
[24:32.71]Wait, didn't I do this exact same thing last time?
[24:35.20]It's so great to be back here, and oh, who am I kidding?
[24:37.64]I hate it here.
[24:39.02]I did this last time.
[24:41.16]I bet you're stuck in this dump, and it sucks!
[24:45.27]Yeah!
[24:46.27]Can you believe that?
[24:47.05]I did this exact same thing last time, except I wasn't like 400 pounds.
[24:51.50]In the WWE, you always have to expect the unexpected, like last time.
[24:55.13]This is the same exact stream you watched fucking a year ago.
[24:57.89]All I did is made myself a little fatter.
[25:01.11]But who cares?
[25:02.55]Arlington sucks, right?
[25:08.00]Why is there shit on my face?
[25:09.36]It's the same cutscene.
[25:11.60]It really is.
[25:14.12]Pretty good rerun stream.
[25:15.96]Say my name and just a fraction of the power and strength that flows through my body.
[25:22.57]We have to start it off the exact same, guys.
[25:26.61]Why am I like a preacher?
[25:27.88]Alright, fucking go home, Jeremy.
[25:30.68]Why did I put the same thing in like I did last time?
[25:32.74]At least the fucking ring is green.
[25:38.16]Okay, so hey, there's your opening promo.
[25:40.32]And now I know what's gonna happen, so I'm putting that up.
[25:47.23]Why can't it just play the fucking thing?
[25:48.87]Why can't it just do it?
[25:52.00]You can't just do it?
[25:55.54]Oh my god.
[25:59.16]Okay, that's fine.
[26:01.16]Here we go.
[26:03.60]So I had to put this in because you can't delete things in 2K17.
[26:10.06]2K17 is like, if you put in something you're not supposed to, you can't delete it.
[26:17.01]Oh, you didn't see everything.
[26:17.87]There's a lot of shit past that first screen.
[26:22.32]Don't worry.
[26:27.10]Move to slow mode?
[26:29.18]Don't worry.
[26:30.48]We're just getting warmed up again.
[26:31.80]Don't worry.
[26:35.52]That sounds dumb as fuck.
[26:36.50]Oh, no, don't worry.
[26:37.52]If you go into universe mode and you make a whole show, you physically cannot remove a match or a promo.
[26:45.07]You can't do it.
[26:46.77]Like, we're talking about some of the most basic fucking of all human things to do in a video game.
[26:52.00]But it's alright.
[26:54.08]Yeah, here we go.
[26:55.48]Now this has to be in it.
[26:56.52]I just had to pick... So last year's champion... Ladies and gentlemen, last year's champion and Sluggo are in the backstage.
[27:06.14]They're gonna like fucking fight for a minute.
[27:11.22]From my understanding.
[27:14.46]Apparently they're not fighting.
[27:17.06]All I can hear is shit on- Okay, there we go.
[27:20.02]This had to be in.
[27:20.88]This is still warm-up.
[27:22.12]This shit had to be in the game.
[27:25.18]This is last year's champion.
[27:27.32]The Fire Serpent versus Sluggo.
[27:32.41]And he's picking up the fucking- He's picking up the Ottoman.
[27:34.69]He's putting it down.
[27:35.41]He doesn't feel like doing anything.
[27:39.05]No clones?
[27:39.61]This is not part of it.
[27:40.89]This is not part of it.
[27:44.02]Nice, like, suplex there by Sluggo, by the way.
[27:48.17]Why is he so slimy?
[27:49.25]Uh, because he's Sluggo.
[27:53.49]Alright, they go.
[27:54.77]They go into the fucking bathroom.
[27:58.07]He is freshly oiled.
[28:00.81]Yeah.
[28:01.18]All this is warm-up.
[28:02.72]So, you know, hey, look, you guys got to see this shit and maybe, like, the next promo.
[28:07.74]That don't matter.
[28:11.99]I think Sluggo's... I think Sluggo's stats are way too small for this.
[28:18.89]Maybe not.
[28:22.03]Nice, like, fucking tornado DDT.
[28:23.51]Now it gets reversed.
[28:27.90]There's your serpent.
[28:28.64]I did promise there were no serpents, but that's not true.
[28:32.98]There's a serpent in the pre-show.
[28:36.22]The pre-show is always bad.
[28:43.49]Alright, can we end this quick, please?
[28:48.01]He's gonna do the same thing.
[28:49.01]Alright, yeah, just chokeslam him into the concrete.
[28:52.09]No, he just reversed the chokeslam.
[28:56.03]Yeah, how is the crowd seeing this?
[28:57.21]There's nobody here.
[28:59.71]He's, like, a full, like, two and a half feet tall.
[29:01.74]Throw him into the fucking wall again.
[29:03.28]Throw him into the padding.
[29:07.46]Wrestling is fake here, man.
[29:12.69]Oh, you guys aren't going to want to miss the main event.
[29:14.37]Trust me on that one.
[29:19.38]Yeah, was somebody saying, where's the audience?
[29:21.40]You're the audience.
[29:22.08]We're the audience.
[29:26.54]We're getting some really good action here.
[29:27.98]I karate chop you and then you karate chop me and then we swing around and I throw you into a wall.
[29:35.43]Are we led to believe that he just smashed the TV?
[29:53.16]No, no, do it again, please.
[29:55.28]Just change it.
[29:56.08]You do it this time.
[29:57.04]Come on.
[29:59.24]You guys wanted the main event?
[30:00.76]There it is.
[30:04.60]Poor Sluggo.
[30:06.86]By the way, again, neither of these two people in the pre-show and the previous ones are in the event.
[30:15.11]There it is.
[30:17.51]It's like picking up a doll.
[30:20.73]Uh, by the way, did not know that Sluggo had stars on his pants.
[30:26.93]Oh, here we go, something else.
[30:28.63]He's picking him up on a powerbomb.
[30:30.95]To what?
[30:35.21]Oh no, he powerbombed him into the backpack.
[30:37.95]Oh, the humanity.
[30:40.01]That's it.
[30:40.87]Okay, Sluggo's dead.
[30:42.65]Sluggo died.
[30:48.34]There's a and you know what good good Sluggo is now actually um he's deleted Fire serpent backstage got a gun an argument with Sluggo and killed him There you go So now we begin now we begin the true festivities Ladies and gentlemen this one of the first of all we met.
[31:11.91]Thank you for the pre-show watching the pre-show
[31:14.49]I'd like to welcome you officially now, officially to Jermania Stream Edition 2017.
[31:20.23]Hopefully you have a great time here.
[31:23.87]As we load the first match, I do want to say that I'm not getting tea.
[31:30.53]And they're loading much faster now, so that's a good thing.
[31:33.69]Makes it easier.
[31:39.59]Hopefully you don't see anything.
[31:40.93]Let me just make sure you don't see anything on screen.
[31:43.94]It is official.
[31:44.62]It is now official.
[31:47.32]We have started.
[31:49.40]Once it loads.
[31:52.17]Loud loading screen.
[31:54.41]How is that possible?
[32:00.63]Where's Glue Man?
[32:01.53]Just wait.
[32:01.91]Just you watch.
[32:05.19]So yeah, Sluggo's dead.
[32:06.97]Even though that was part of the pre-show, it's not part of the pre-show.
[32:12.36]Alright, here we go.
[32:13.72]The first match is about to begin.
[32:14.68]It's one that's very near and dear to my heart.
[32:18.68]And I'm sure you'll find out why very soon.
[32:23.88]Once it is ready to go.
[32:28.00]Delete Sluggo.
[32:29.12]Thank you MostlyLost for the bits.
[32:30.40]I just saw it pop up in chat.
[32:31.90]Thank you for the $40.
[32:32.64]There are almost 4,000 people watching.
[32:34.98]Holy shit.
[32:36.33]Well, hopefully these matches are worth it.
[32:38.77]Thanks for sticking around, guys.
[32:43.02]We don't have seven dragons, although there's no previous characters that are actually really in it.
[32:47.82]It's mostly new characters.
[32:49.84]For the most part.
[32:50.70]Some of the matches have some, some don't.
[32:53.90]But, uh, we are stuck on this loading screen.
[32:57.36]Come on!
[32:59.28]Come on, 2K!
[33:00.52]2K, come on, you bought the license!
[33:02.34]You got the license from THQ, and what'd you do?
[33:05.41]Can't approve the fucking loading screens in 2017?
[33:07.49]The entire dev team is here.
[33:18.39]You can speculate on characters all you want.
[33:20.21]Don't worry.
[33:23.35]Having flashbacks to the great Jermania crash of 2016.
[33:26.36]I am too right now.
[33:28.56]Here we go!
[33:29.92]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the first match of Jermania 2017 Stream Edition.
[33:36.14]Again, like I said, we're in Jervis' backyard.
[33:38.62]And the first match is going to be a very important one.
[33:41.11]Because you can hear those boos start to resonate into the arena right now.
[33:44.11]Very, very loudly.
[33:45.63]That's Jerma.
[33:47.78]The following contest is scheduled for one fall.
[33:50.10]It is a handicap tag team match.
[33:53.00]Jerma is going to be the one person on the first team.
[33:58.32]It is going to be Jerma versus two opponents.
[34:01.24]And as you can see, all the money.
[34:02.19]Look at all those bits lying around.
[34:03.51]There's hundreds of dollars worth of bits in that ring.
[34:05.93]Oh, look at all that money raining.
[34:07.97]This is a stream, for Christ's sake.
[34:09.65]Of course there's going to be money, and of course it's all going to go to Jerma.
[34:13.50]Look at everybody in the audience just thrown out.
[34:15.12]There was a $100 donation right there.
[34:16.54]There was a $200 donation.
[34:18.98]Unbelievable.
[34:20.88]And his opponent.
[34:22.78]His opponents.
[34:24.16]Mind you, his opponents.
[34:25.78]On their way to the ring right now.
[34:26.84]You have, ladies and gentlemen, you have the VR guy and his PSVR.
[34:32.77]That's right.
[34:33.31]He can't go anywhere without it because the cords, obviously, look at all those fucking cords for the PlayStation VR.
[34:38.17]There are a lot of them.
[34:40.02]And actually, the VR guy is not currently knowing where he is.
[34:43.51]He's currently playing his VR.
[34:46.51]And they are going to be in the ring right now.
[34:47.75]The PSVR is the one that's coming after Jerma, the VR guy.
[34:51.75]Just, you know, you have to be so close.
[34:53.57]The cords are so fucking short.
[34:56.12]And I think, I'm not sure what he's playing right now.
[34:57.40]He might be playing DOOM VR.
[34:58.58]That's coming out soon.
[35:00.50]So this is a handicap tag team match.
[35:01.78]I think, you know, they're going to let the VR guy go in the ring first, it seems.
[35:06.60]We got VR guy and his, of course, PSVR.
[35:11.97]We'll see how this goes.
[35:13.07]Jerma, as you know, is very, very upset at the PSVR.
[35:16.85]But he got a guy on eBay to, like, come bring his PSVR, and this is what it is.
[35:22.34]And he's apparently... I think he does not know where he is, like last time.
[35:27.72]Last time he was on a Vive, because he was wireless.
[35:30.23]But this time, of course, on the PSVR.
[35:32.31]So let's get us started here.
[35:33.13]Jerma going in for a couple of punches now.
[35:34.49]Grabs him by the knee.
[35:35.65]Grabs him by the sock, it seems.
[35:38.05]Takes him up and slams him down.
[35:39.21]Oh, those cords were getting a little tangled there.
[35:41.59]No, he reverses it!
[35:43.55]Unbeknownst to the VR guy, look at these... He must be playing something with fucking melee combat!
[35:49.32]See, he does a couple of kicks there to Jerma's back.
[35:51.68]Jerma has no beef at all with the VR guy.
[35:54.88]There's absolutely none.
[35:56.40]He just wants his revenge on the PSVR.
[36:00.54]Now the PSVR is currently doing all kinds of taunting.
[36:04.29]Another stomp on the back there by the VR guy.
[36:07.37]Whoa, what is...
[36:13.51]VR guy, VR guy I think was just in the middle of a flight simulator, and thought he could take off.
[36:18.00]He was in the middle of a flying simulator there it seems, and he did not make his mark.
[36:22.10]And nice flying, nice flying lariat there onto Jerva.
[36:25.26]Jerva's back seems to be the target.
[36:28.27]As, uh, now, ooh, right into the Hanes underwear.
[36:32.17]Courtesy of Jerva, does a spin around kick, oh DDT, that's a devastating one.
[36:35.99]Right into the crowd of his face, pushing the VR helmet directly into his brain.
[36:41.00]And now Jerma here gonna go for... He's got him by... He's doing a leg stretch!
[36:45.46]This could be it!
[36:45.98]No, that's not it!
[36:46.72]He's gonna turn it around into a pin?
[36:47.64]No, he's spinning it around.
[36:48.56]And remember, this is a handicap tag, so the PSVR can interfere if he wants to, but I don't think he will.
[36:56.95]I mean, he is just a console.
[36:58.95]It's not like, oh no, the VR guy going for the high-flying move.
[37:05.56]I didn't even know I gave him that move.
[37:07.60]But, again... Again, you know, he must be on, like, Trampoline Simulator 2025.
[37:11.22]Ooh, big right.
[37:13.78]Right into the VR guy's head.
[37:18.85]And... Picking him...
[37:23.37]I'm sorry.
[37:24.75]I'm sorry.
[37:25.15]Like, some of these are just so... I don't even expect... And... The fir... No!
[37:30.21]He... He is... He is gonna climb up on here and put his Two Fingers in the air.
[37:34.99]No, he's just taunting.
[37:35.85]Doesn't seem to be actually in any real mood to go after Jerma.
[37:39.32]But Jerma is in a bad spot right now.
[37:42.34]I think it's because of all the weight he's gained over the last couple of years.
[37:45.94]He's definitely pushing over 200 or 300 pounds.
[37:47.78]Oh, the VR guy gonna go for another flying simulator move.
[37:49.86]Look at that flight simulator move!
[37:52.09]Unbelievable!
[37:53.13]He's gonna go for it again!
[37:55.75]He's playing Superman 3D!
[37:57.95]He's gonna go for his patented move, the Superman 3D!
[38:01.03]This is it!
[38:02.79]One!
[38:03.86]Two!
[38:04.48]No!
[38:04.84]Jerma kicks out!
[38:05.76]Jerma kicks out after the Superman 3D, his favorite VR game.
[38:09.44]No, and in comes PlayStation VR!
[38:12.22]This is where it's gonna get ugly.
[38:14.36]He comes in to pit him.
[38:16.50]One.
[38:17.12]No, Jermu's not gonna let that happen.
[38:18.70]Absolutely not.
[38:20.08]How could Jermu let such a piece of shit device with fucking cords everywhere?
[38:23.87]And they're all so short and annoying.
[38:25.55]How could he ever let such a device get him?
[38:27.25]Look, he's wrapping them up in the cords.
[38:28.79]He's getting all wrapped up in those cords.
[38:30.01]Remember when he streamed that game?
[38:31.47]And he got all fucking wrapped up.
[38:33.17]That's a fucking signature move from the PSVR.
[38:36.36]As the PSVR picks up Jermu.
[38:38.92]And, no, gets kicked in the face.
[38:41.24]Now, Jerma has to be careful here.
[38:42.58]He doesn't want to break the PSVR.
[38:45.47]Because they're expensive.
[38:47.35]Ooh, big right hand.
[38:50.29]No, he's going to go... He's going for something big here.
[38:52.63]It's a snap DDT on the PSVR.
[38:55.82]Although the VR guy seems to be currently in another game.
[38:59.38]He's in Audience Simulator 2019.
[39:01.54]That's when you stand there and you have the headset on and you're in a crowd.
[39:05.77]So he's just over there playing his own game.
[39:08.99]He might be having glitches right now.
[39:10.53]It's possible that he may.
[39:11.35]He may be getting glitched out because of all the corruptive files that could be going on inside the PlayStation VR when you take that type of strenuous, painful punches.
[39:23.66]Now, Jerma is... He's gonna roll around to get pinned by the PSVR.
[39:28.20]We got a one.
[39:29.34]We've got a two!
[39:30.02]Holy shit!
[39:39.07]That was pathetic!
[39:41.07]That was unbelievably pathetic.
[39:43.21]Jerma gets punched in the face a few times, and we get to watch the VR guy go through his favorite fuckin' Superman 3D simulator.
[39:50.24]on his trampoline.
[39:52.12]And that's it, ladies and gentlemen.
[39:53.16]The PlayStation VR gets the last laugh and the VR guy as well.
[39:56.84]Jerma loses again.
[39:59.05]Let's take a look at PSVR.
[40:00.31]All he had to do was just tangle him up a little bit and put those three pins on him.
[40:03.17]One, two, three.
[40:07.39]And let's see the final move here.
[40:08.55]It was just a knee to the back.
[40:10.66]That's all it took.
[40:11.52]Jerma really needs to get back to the gym.
[40:14.18]He's gained so much weight.
[40:15.78]It's just sad, you know?
[40:20.34]Just like in real life, the PlayStation VR beats Jerma.
[40:24.30]So, that's the first match of the evening.
[40:28.26]Getting shoved.
[40:30.21]He might have been upset about something.
[40:31.97]The PSVR was glitching out there because of all the pain it was taking.
[40:35.17]And he got mad at the device.
[40:37.93]He's like, what the fuck?
[40:38.69]He was playing like Minecraft or something.
[40:40.19]He got really mad.
[40:42.71]Alright, let's move on to the next one.
[40:45.87]First match is over.
[40:46.73]I'm just lying on the ground.
[40:48.57]Okay.
[40:50.27]And here we go.
[40:52.15]Next match.
[40:52.89]Coming up.
[40:55.05]The next piece of journey.
[40:59.88]I forgot about this.
[41:00.86]Alright.
[41:03.88]This is either going to be real funny or real lame.
[41:07.44]And I don't know.
[41:08.00]I haven't figured that out yet.
[41:10.78]I'm not sure.
[41:13.75]But this is going to introduce you guys to, like, I don't know.
[41:16.53]This is going to be one of those things where you guys are going to take this real well.
[41:21.06]Or, like, I'm just a fucking loser.
[41:24.14]I'm not sure.
[41:31.92]Let me see if there's anything that came through in the meantime.
[41:35.79]In the meantime.
[41:37.63]Yeah, mostly lost.
[41:38.33]Thanks for the $40.
[41:38.87]You gave like $40 for 4,000 viewers.
[41:43.31]Thank you so much, everybody, for hanging out.
[41:46.96]If you like what you see, make sure you follow the stream and come back in a year when we do this again once a year.
[41:54.26]Come on.
[41:54.86]Other streams are good, too.
[41:56.60]Other streams are good.
[41:58.83]Thank you, Cosmosis Jones for the bits.
[42:00.91]Kinger...
[42:02.68]SSBM Icarus for the bits, Beepsu, Emperor William, and Nice Meme.
[42:08.54]Also Sir Squeegee for the 10 bucks as well.
[42:12.39]You guys rock.
[42:14.95]You did not?
[42:16.17]We have barely started the stream, so you have not missed anything.
[42:21.21]If you think you missed something, you didn't.
[42:23.54]Don't worry.
[42:24.86]There's plenty.
[42:27.71]Let's get back into it here as I'm getting word that we have something going on somebody's coming out here to speak and Somebody's coming out here to speak I think here.
[42:40.99]Let's see what's going on here Wait a minute ladies and gentlemen, that's Is that how I think it is?
[42:48.90]Of course, of course it is.
[42:50.38]That's Captain Cheez-It.
[42:51.26]Oh
[42:52.42]He's making his first ever appearance in the Jerma wrestling event.
[42:55.88]He's coming over the ropes.
[42:56.82]I'm not sure why.
[42:58.92]He is Captain Cheez-It.
[43:00.58]He's the captain of all Cheez-Its.
[43:03.80]And he seems to have something to say.
[43:04.94]Let's see what it is.
[43:05.90]A lot of you have been doubting me lately.
[43:13.95]Wondering if I have what it takes to go the distance here.
[43:16.57]Well, then maybe it's time I set the record straight on a few things.
[43:21.00]That's right.
[43:22.58]I'm gonna keep your friends close, put your enemies closer.
[43:25.58]We've all heard that quote before.
[43:26.98]Only some of us listen to it.
[43:28.69]Well, I'm someone that always followed that rule.
[43:31.05]Except for lately.
[43:32.29]And you know what?
[43:33.27]I'm gonna call somebody up backstage.
[43:35.57]Because I think that for real, Charlie Cheese Nips is looking for a fight.
[43:39.89]I ain't hard to find, so let's fucking do this.
[43:42.51]Cheese Nips are the most flavorful.
[43:44.53]They're more toasted.
[43:46.24]And they're more delicious.
[43:46.96]But wait a minute.
[43:48.78]Here comes Charlie Cheese Nips.
[43:51.77]The biggest, goofiest piece of shit in the world!
[43:57.41]Here he is!
[44:00.62]Charlie Cheesnips and Captain Cheese have gotten a little scuffle here.
[44:07.48]And as you can see, Charlie Cheesnips is a fucking turd.
[44:11.64]He is known as the worst mascot.
[44:14.14]One of the absolute not funny, not interesting mascots.
[44:17.48]And apparently he has something to say.
[44:24.16]The WWE Universe, I know most of you turned out to listen to this guy and listen to me.
[44:28.66]Cheeselips, they taste more like crackers and they're disgusting and they taste like old cheese.
[44:34.41]You don't think I know this shit?
[44:36.49]You and me, later on tonight, settle it once and for all to find out what the best cheat is, Cheez-It is.
[44:47.13]Okay, yes, I agree.
[44:48.21]You and me, one-on-one for the best Cheez-It.
[44:50.93]Oh, you heard it here, ladies and gentlemen.
[44:52.23]Can you believe it?
[44:55.48]It's too bad you can't do, like, voiceovers in any of these games.
[44:59.07]And you can't do custom animations in this game either.
[45:01.57]But that's unbelievable.
[45:02.79]I can't believe we're gonna get... We're going to get a chi- Who has- Who is the best cheese-flavored cracker later on?
[45:13.62]Tonight, that's pretty fucking remarkable.
[45:16.98]They're still talking.
[45:19.24]He's just staring at them.
[45:22.11]Off the script.
[45:24.32]Yeah, it is off the script.
[45:25.42]I would have done my own stupid fucking script, but you can't do that in WWE 2K3rd, whatever fucking year it is.
[45:34.64]So yeah, there's your Cheez-It vs. Cheez-Nibs reveal.
[45:38.96]Cheez-Nibs is gonna get his fucking ass kicked.
[45:43.58]So yeah, let's go on to the next thing.
[45:48.34]Dude, the funniest thing about this, I did this last time too.
[45:51.30]Wait a minute.
[45:58.19]Wait, what?
[45:59.27]What's going on?
[46:00.63]Wait, what?
[46:01.19]What's going on here?
[46:02.57]Why are they starting this right now?
[46:04.15]They're not supposed to start this.
[46:06.81]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[46:08.87]They're not supposed to fight right now.
[46:11.76]This is not a match.
[46:12.74]The game just is like fucking up.
[46:14.30]This is supposed to be a promo where they just talk shit.
[46:17.82]Well, Charlie cheesed and he missed completely.
[46:21.36]Charlie cheesed.
[46:22.10]No, it's fucking Captain cheesed and Charlie cheesed him.
[46:26.50]That's not supposed to happen.
[46:28.36]This shit isn't supposed to happen.
[46:29.60]Charlie Cheese Nips is not supposed to humiliate Cheese.
[46:32.90]It's way better.
[46:35.97]What is fucking going on?
[46:38.59]You guys are starting way too prematurely.
[46:44.77]I kind of want to let this play out, though.
[46:49.97]No, the Cheese Snips did not win.
[46:51.70]Do you see how much cooler looking fucking Cheez-Its look?
[46:57.16]We're just basing off of, like, pure physical appearance here.
[47:00.76]Charlie Cheesnip is, like, looks terrible.
[47:04.37]He's out of shape.
[47:05.79]He doesn't have huge arms.
[47:08.91]Okay, this has gone on long enough.
[47:11.83]We need to, like, fucking get off of this.
[47:16.41]Okay, hold on a second.
[47:17.65]Hold on a second.
[47:18.35]What?
[47:19.87]I can't skip this either.
[47:23.28]Oh, he hit him in the elbow.
[47:23.98]I can't skip it.
[47:26.12]Why is it changing camera angles?
[47:31.42]Okay.
[47:31.98]So the referee has decided to break it up.
[47:33.56]No, come on!
[47:35.16]Oh my god.
[47:35.94]Okay, fine.
[47:36.48]There you go.
[47:36.96]Charlie Cheese Nips and Captain Cheese It later on are going to be in a fight to the death.
[47:42.57]Winner has the best cheese-flavored snack.
[47:48.11]That was a little fucked up for my brain to handle.
[47:53.82]This next one's going to be good.
[47:57.77]I hope you guys are ready for the next one.
[48:01.56]There's a lot of fan favorites in this one.
[48:08.44]I don't know who I want to win.
[48:10.00]I really don't.
[48:13.73]So stupid.
[48:14.55]I told you.
[48:15.01]I wasn't sure if like... I didn't know if that was going to be wicked stupid or wicked funny.
[48:19.79]And it turns out it was kind of a combination of both.
[48:25.06]Mmm, so this is coming up is a six-man elimination tag match 3v3 That match was a little cheesy Six-man elimination tag match This one's gonna be a lot of fucking fun
[48:52.79]I've seen a lot of people in the chat.
[48:54.15]I've seen a lot of people in the chat write out what they think is going to happen.
[48:59.75]You might be right.
[49:00.93]Who knows?
[49:06.60]Why is there a mode in the game where you can plan a show and it doesn't go according to plan?
[49:11.50]Why is there a create a show in this game if you can't actually make a show?
[49:16.76]There are six promos you can choose from.
[49:19.70]You know how many were in 2K fucking 16?
[49:21.97]I mean, uh, 2K14?
[49:23.77]Like, 128 different scenarios that could play out.
[49:28.45]You can do six.
[49:31.13]Glad they're spending fucking quality time on the, uh, on the game.
[49:34.20]Over the last four years.
[49:39.80]I love how this is like, half of this is like, hey, let's do Jermania 2017, and the other half is like, fucking this game sucks.
[49:54.33]Even still, the creation suite is good.
[49:56.89]It's not even close to being as good.
[50:00.71]Did it start right?
[50:01.33]The rumble is not until the very end.
[50:03.81]It's the last thing of the evening.
[50:06.18]It's a 30-man rumble.
[50:08.36]Can't you mod this game, though?
[50:10.82]There's really no mods for it.
[50:12.64]It's on PC, but there's no... All the mods are just characters that have been added.
[50:20.16]It's not like insane shit that people have made.
[50:22.18]I've looked.
[50:22.68]I've tried.
[50:26.06]Just pop in 2K14.
[50:27.44]2K14's so slow.
[50:31.12]I have like a hundred something, I think, characters made in 2K14.
[50:34.97]Turning that game on takes like four minutes.
[50:38.41]And going through the menus.
[50:40.97]It's just unbearable.
[50:45.73]I'm the only person that bought this game.
[50:46.91]That's not true.
[50:49.89]And this isn't slow.
[50:50.71]Oh, you think this is slow?
[50:51.93]If this was 2K14, we'd be here for a long time.
[50:58.05]We're almost done.
[50:58.55]It's almost loaded.
[51:03.59]I don't even know how this format is going to work either.
[51:10.11]So this format is either going to work very well or very bad.
[51:13.30]But it's ready to go.
[51:14.64]Here we go.
[51:15.12]Six man elimination tag match.
[51:18.58]Let's see who it is.
[51:26.90]Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the Jerma arena, for the first time ever, it's the Vumps from Family Feud.
[51:35.01]Earl Vump, Peggy Vump, and Rodney Vump making their way, all three of them, into the arena.
[51:40.92]They are an incredibly inquisitive family.
[51:43.88]Very, very, very smart.
[51:45.40]Earl Vump is seen as the anchor.
[51:48.12]And Peggy Vump has a nickname, The Maiden.
[51:51.14]The Strife's Maiden is what they call her.
[51:53.41]And Roddy Vump, the son, he's kind of just there.
[51:57.29]And, you know, they call him The Muscle at some points.
[52:01.03]But here are the Vumps, the Black Vumps, courtesy of the Family Feud streams.
[52:08.10]And their opponents...
[52:10.17]Their opponents, if you could guess that they were never going to show up in a fucking stream, you better believe they were.
[52:15.73]All the way from the movies.
[52:17.93]Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome.
[52:23.14]Gorilla reading a book.
[52:24.62]The orangutan and Harold Sludge from the movies.
[52:29.26]Six man elimination tag match incoming.
[52:34.95]Harold Sludge is technically dead.
[52:41.84]But it's okay.
[52:43.48]You can revive him for an opportunity like this.
[52:46.80]We will prove once and for all.
[52:50.40]Who had the best stream?
[52:52.82]Is it the movies?
[52:54.24]Or was it the Family Feud streams?
[52:56.50]I don't know.
[52:58.26]That's a fucking question for the scholars.
[53:00.29]And that guy.
[53:00.93]And that guy.
[53:01.43]The same fucking face model.
[53:03.05]Like nine of the same face models.
[53:06.57]Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[53:08.45]You've been waiting for this shit.
[53:10.59]Here it is.
[53:12.65]Why does he have a bottle of water and not a book?
[53:16.01]He's not supposed to have a bottle of water in his hand.
[53:21.89]Why does he have what?
[53:22.75]Okay.
[53:23.97]So pretend that was a book.
[53:27.53]Here we go.
[53:29.39]He's staying real hydrated.
[53:31.73]Looks like Rodney Bump is going to be the first one in.
[53:34.41]And the gorilla reading a book is going to be the other one.
[53:37.23]Remember, this is an elimination tag match.
[53:40.54]Whoever gets pinned is out.
[53:41.78]The other two stay in.
[53:43.48]And a gorilla reading a book right off the bat.
[53:45.46]Two knees.
[53:46.54]And an elbow right into Rodney Vump's face.
[53:48.77]He is a fucking gorilla.
[53:50.39]No, gets reversed.
[53:51.13]No, double reversal there.
[53:53.11]Rodney Vump, a shoulder tackle.
[53:55.79]Now the gorilla reading a book is just picking him up by his ears and throwing him down to the ground.
[54:01.38]I don't know.
[54:01.82]I'm not sure how you compete.
[54:03.18]I mean, Harold Sludge has the strength of a four-year-old.
[54:06.02]But you do have two actual gorillas.
[54:08.56]Right into the gut there.
[54:09.42]Right punch.
[54:10.97]And a... Oh, a Luthez Press!
[54:13.13]Courtesy of Stone Cold Steve Austin, he watches a lot of TV.
[54:16.28]That's how he gets all those trivia questions correctly.
[54:18.10]Now he's going for a Cobra Clutch.
[54:21.02]This could be it!
[54:21.46]Well, here come the Vumps!
[54:22.22]Here come... They're flooding the ring!
[54:24.36]No, wait, why are they turning around?
[54:26.26]What?
[54:26.78]Why are the Vumps fucking not doing anything?
[54:28.78]The Vumps have all turned around and the... Gorilla can read a book in the orangutan... No, no, that was... That was very anticlimactic.
[54:36.53]Thought there was gonna be a showdown there, but no, apparently not.
[54:40.45]It's a wonderful camera shake, though.
[54:42.55]While the gorilla reading a book is just strangling Rodney Vump.
[54:46.44]While Harold Sludge just cheers on.
[54:49.38]And there are rules here.
[54:50.62]This had to be a... This needed to be... Oh, no.
[54:53.94]This is a tag.
[54:54.72]This is just disgusting here.
[54:56.40]They're just double teaming now.
[54:59.01]I'm not sure what the Vumps are doing.
[55:01.45]But in some regard, you need to get into the ring and protect your son for crying out loud.
[55:09.10]Now, all the while, Jerm is getting a text.
[55:10.20]Peggy Vump is getting called in now, as Rowdy Vump needs to cool off a little.
[55:14.64]Peggy Vump is actually considered the strongest one.
[55:18.72]She just got kicked in the mouth by Harold Sludge, who is the weakest one.
[55:24.87]So, no, nice reversal there!
[55:28.25]She calls that one Satan's Kneecap for a reason.
[55:31.69]Stomping into Harold Sludge's back.
[55:33.69]Peggy Vump now, nice jumping kick.
[55:37.35]And an elbow drop too.
[55:42.14]That may have just seen something we weren't supposed to see.
[55:49.08]They have just seen up a Peggy bump's fucking skirt.
[55:52.09]Holy shit.
[55:53.97]Okay, anyways, Harold's Ludge is dragging Peggy bump now into the center of the ring with a right hook right into the face.
[56:04.32]Peggy Vomp now doing a couple of tosses.
[56:06.76]Oh, a bear hug gets reversed into a sweeping leg press.
[56:11.02]I don't know how this is going to work out.
[56:12.10]I really don't.
[56:13.34]Because once somebody... Oh, it looks like Earl Vomp is going to be coming in.
[56:15.88]Maybe we can get some double team here on Harold Sludge.
[56:19.28]Looks... No.
[56:20.54]He's trying to grab at the referee for some reason.
[56:23.20]Right in the back of the head.
[56:24.72]He bit him.
[56:25.84]And now he's picking up.
[56:26.56]Nice toss.
[56:27.20]It might not be strong enough to do a fall suplex there.
[56:32.14]The grill is just kind of getting in the way.
[56:33.40]They're very large and they're very colorful.
[56:36.00]Peggy Vompa was just nodding.
[56:37.12]No!
[56:38.74]A reversal?
[56:41.80]He does kind of look like Walter White, but that's not Walter Wright.
[56:45.65]Walter White.
[56:46.71]Walter Wright, whatever his name is.
[56:48.45]What's that show that everybody likes?
[56:49.61]You snooze, you lose.
[56:52.87]Whatever it is.
[56:53.35]The one where he makes like fucking candy and he sells drugs and shit.
[56:58.47]As, oh, big, heavy slam by the gorilla reading a book.
[57:08.53]Breaking worse.
[57:11.00]Right hook, right hand into the forehead and Earl Bump gets out of it though.
[57:15.30]Goes for a Jerma Suplex.
[57:16.18]No, gets rigged.
[57:17.30]He's been working on those big punches to the head.
[57:20.45]Wow!
[57:21.65]A huge behind the full Nelson slam.
[57:24.83]Nice kick out of there by Earl Bump.
[57:26.93]As Earl Bump goes for a tackle here.
[57:28.91]Somebody's going to get pinned here eventually.
[57:31.57]Is this ever going to end?
[57:32.47]I don't know.
[57:32.79]Somebody has to get eliminated and then what happens?
[57:36.58]Nice.
[57:37.28]Very nice.
[57:38.64]EarlVomp is getting warned here by the referee to get out of the ring.
[57:42.46]He just won't do it.
[57:44.99]He just won't do it.
[57:47.17]Now he did.
[57:47.79]I'm not sure what the hell he was doing there.
[57:49.11]He was looking to get disqualified or something.
[57:50.65]I don't know what the fuck he was thinking.
[57:52.83]Big overbody press there by the... He's going to snap his neck.
[57:56.70]He's going to snap his neck.
[57:57.88]Gorilla Reading a Book is snapping his neck in half.
[58:00.42]Is Rodney Vomp going to die on camera?
[58:03.15]Oh, just barely didn't die because he's not a real person.
[58:05.09]Here comes a pin!
[58:06.47]One!
[58:07.51]Two!
[58:08.01]No, just almost.
[58:09.41]Didn't even get a two count there.
[58:12.34]Came pretty close.
[58:15.40]And pinning somebody in a six-man elimination tag is going to look to be pretty difficult to do.
[58:21.78]It would seem.
[58:23.30]As Peggy Bump is now going to be called in to replace Rodney.
[58:27.43]Rodney's been in there quite a long time.
[58:29.25]Immediately she gets punched in the face.
[58:32.40]A straight-up punching combo.
[58:35.28]And Earl Vump is clapping about that.
[58:37.58]Earl Vump is really happy that his wife just got punched in the face like three times.
[58:41.75]Wow, big Samoan drop there.
[58:44.55]I think that's the name of that move, if I'm correct.
[58:49.47]This is gonna take a while, folks.
[58:53.53]The gorilla, I mean, remember, the gorilla's not a human.
[58:56.47]Didn't know... Oh, almost.
[58:58.61]Peggy Vump, you almost did a move.
[59:01.70]And it's not, what, the disrespect is unbelievable.
[59:05.70]The gorilla reading a book just did the move she was trying to do, taunting the audience, and just, he's... Okay, now, the gorilla reading a book is... Doing a, uh, reverse crab walk.
[59:22.07]To... Peggy Fump.
[59:24.71]And, you know, it's because, it's because that's, that's Bray Wyatt's move, Seth.
[59:32.19]It's going to be on to Peggy Bump.
[59:35.05]Peggy Bump has been eliminated.
[59:36.88]See you later, Peggy Bump.
[59:37.92]Now it's just down to Earl and Rodney Bump.
[59:43.64]Peggy Bump has been eliminated.
[59:52.03]The gorilla reading a book has been the one in here the whole time.
[59:56.04]Has the orangutan even been in the ring once?
[59:58.72]I don't think so.
[59:59.68]That means that T has plenty of strength.
[60:03.02]Way too much for, I think, the bumps to be able to handle.
[60:05.06]But the bumps, remember the bumps won on Family Feud that one time.
[60:08.33]Big over-the-head shoulder throw there by the gorilla reading a book.
[60:12.18]Finally gonna get to see the orangutan.
[60:13.64]Maybe.
[60:14.44]Yes, we are.
[60:15.70]Here comes the orangutan while we have a very tired and destroyed and beat down Earl Vump.
[60:21.62]You need some type of miracle here when you have three versus two and you're this tired.
[60:28.24]And the orangutan's putting him right into the turnbuckle.
[60:32.34]This could be another elimination.
[60:33.58]We've got one.
[60:34.24]Here comes Rodney Vump.
[60:35.36]Two.
[60:35.68]No.
[60:36.08]Just barely.
[60:38.42]Just barely.
[60:39.06]No clones?
[60:39.56]These aren't clones.
[60:41.50]Hey, hey, the orangutan ain't even in the rumble.
[60:43.56]Don't worry about it.
[60:44.28]There's fucking no clones here.
[60:46.50]And just enough of that, that really got Earl Vump fired up.
[60:52.68]No clones.
[60:53.70]There's no clones.
[60:56.28]Not in the rumble.
[60:59.61]Rowdy Vump gets thrown in the mud.
[61:00.79]Earl Vump is still in the ring.
[61:02.93]We might see a big top rope maneuver here, I would assume.
[61:05.55]No, gonna go in the other corner.
[61:08.31]A big orangutan splash there, and the bumps don't stand a chance, guys.
[61:13.39]I don't know what else to tell you besides the bumps do not stand a chance.
[61:15.95]Not just being taunted to stand up.
[61:17.23]The orangutan's going to do his finishing move.
[61:20.38]The ex-wife!
[61:21.56]There it is.
[61:23.24]That's the ex-wife.
[61:24.84]I just made that up on the fly.
[61:26.08]That's not even the real move, and he's going to break his... No, I'm going to do a break his... No!
[61:29.34]Break his neck...
[61:37.12]Spoilers enter the ring.
[61:38.42]There's no spoilers.
[61:40.94]That was a good stun gun.
[61:46.80]Just, like, punches.
[61:51.34]I don't know how it's... Like, how do you win an elimination tag match if you already are down a person?
[61:58.71]The bumps are chumps right now.
[61:59.95]Yeah, we haven't seen anything particularly fascinating from any of them.
[62:05.59]They're just fucking shitty people.
[62:07.11]And EarlVump is, like, dying in the corner right now.
[62:10.81]You had an opportunity!
[62:11.85]EarlVump, you had an opportunity to do a giant diving splash off the top ropes and you didn't do anything!
[62:17.38]You just got reversed!
[62:19.56]Wait a minute.
[62:20.06]EarlVump might be going for a special move here.
[62:23.52]No, he just punched him in the face.
[62:24.82]What a good special move, Earl.
[62:27.06]Oh, drag him into the center of the ring.
[62:28.84]No, you dragged him to pin him.
[62:30.48]We might get an elimination.
[62:31.32]The orangutan could be out.
[62:32.64]Two!
[62:32.96]No one cares!
[62:34.20]Just barely.
[62:38.12]Wow.
[62:39.70]That was actually pretty surprising.
[62:41.48]Rodney Vump is in bad shape over there.
[62:44.80]I really don't think... If Earl Vump gets eliminated right now, then there's no way that the Vumps are gonna win.
[62:56.78]He won't even come in to save his dad.
[62:58.44]He won't even come in the fucking ring.
[63:03.63]Now they're getting booed.
[63:04.37]The movies are getting booed right now.
[63:06.99]I wonder why.
[63:08.01]The movies are like fan favorites.
[63:09.43]I have no idea why the orangutan guy is now tagged out.
[63:13.79]Gorilla Riding Book is in.
[63:14.77]On the top ropes now.
[63:18.33]I can't... Don't tag in Rodney Bump.
[63:26.27]You're gonna lose.
[63:30.42]That was just for good.
[63:31.06]He's pissed.
[63:32.06]The Gorilla Riding Book is not happy about that one from Earl Bump.
[63:36.59]I wonder if we're gonna get to see one elimination.
[63:40.11]There's one!
[63:40.87]There's two!
[63:41.87]No.
[63:42.39]Not even close.
[63:43.85]A nice bulldog.
[63:45.91]By EarlVomp on the orangutan.
[63:48.65]The orangutan can't get up.
[63:50.53]Sitting in the middle of the ring.
[64:01.64]He's not, he doesn't have any health.
[64:02.82]The Vomps are so fucked up.
[64:05.20]All it takes is one of the bumps to get pinned.
[64:07.68]From a finishing move.
[64:10.01]Bring in Harold.
[64:11.85]Harold Sludge.
[64:12.71]No, Harold Sludge is not going to come in.
[64:16.39]That's reversal there by the... Sludge is a piece of... Yeah, Sludge is not done.
[64:23.22]Sludge came in once in the beginning.
[64:24.74]That's it.
[64:26.73]That's gotta be it.
[64:28.01]Earl is way too tired.
[64:29.29]That's one.
[64:29.81]That's two.
[64:30.89]And the fight that's still in Rodney Vump is... Wait, why is the orangutan over there suplexing Earl Vump?
[64:39.22]Okay.
[64:40.06]That was just... That was just not nice.
[64:42.84]And this is where he... Oh, watch out for the referee.
[64:44.68]Don't knock the referee down.
[64:48.87]This is sad.
[64:50.91]Look at these two fucking dipshits.
[64:53.26]Here comes the crab lock again.
[64:56.06]Good thing you're wasting time.
[64:58.34]Why is Harold Sludge coming in the ring?
[65:01.76]Why are they all in the ring?
[65:04.94]Pin him!
[65:05.30]Pin him!
[65:09.24]Pin him!
[65:19.28]It's just chaos.
[65:22.06]Referee is down.
[65:24.50]The movies had a chance to win right there.
[65:26.67]And for some reason, Harold Smudge decided it was more important to run and get fucking hit by the ref.
[65:33.07]And then knocked the referee down.
[65:34.65]That's all he's done in the entire time he's been in the match.
[65:37.61]so congratulations Carol sludge you had a chance and now it could be the downfall of the movies because the bumps now Rodney bump that's not you don't want to give Rodney bump any more than five seconds he's trying he's like get up he's like get the up on the second rope like a real wuss that's not even like a real move no good job second rope oh no no god
[66:12.10]Where's Harold Sludge?
[66:24.73]Oh, a good reversal there.
[66:26.55]I wish somebody would fucking pin someone.
[66:31.77]That was pretty close to a three count.
[66:33.29]Rodney, you've got to pick him up before you try to do a move.
[66:36.37]Harold Sludge still cheering.
[66:38.79]Again, don't go into the second rope.
[66:40.41]It's not worth it.
[66:41.17]Go on the top rope.
[66:41.93]Don't be such a baby.
[66:43.89]Get on the top rope.
[66:44.67]Call like it.
[66:45.13]Get Earl in there.
[66:47.51]Now make it happen.
[66:48.65]Let's see an elimination.
[66:51.65]Jesus Christ.
[66:53.89]I love how they drag them around.
[66:55.25]And he just walked on his chest.
[66:57.51]Great move.
[66:59.43]Good leg drop, though.
[67:00.81]Unfortunately, he's not gonna be able to... The stamina that the gorillas have... Ooh!
[67:05.70]What a reversal!
[67:06.38]He goes into a dance move just to prove how cool he is.
[67:10.16]Picks up the gorilla reading a book right hand.
[67:13.56]We talked a lot of shit.
[67:15.54]But he's got him in a chokehold right now.
[67:17.95]Holy shit!
[67:20.97]He just fucking...
[67:23.00]decimated him.
[67:24.34]He just grabbed him by the throat and threw him behind him.
[67:26.42]This could be a pin here.
[67:27.70]One.
[67:28.66]Two!
[67:29.24]Harold Sludge just barely broke it up!
[67:31.22]Good job, Harold Sludge!
[67:33.31]Harold Sludge coming to the rescue, breaking up the pin.
[67:37.63]Old man Vump has still got to go for another submission.
[67:40.61]This could be it.
[67:41.89]No, he doesn't want to go for a submission.
[67:44.81]He wants to just continue to toy with the guerrilla reading book.
[67:48.33]Karate chop right to the top of the... Right on his fucking crown of his head.
[67:54.39]And they're gonna switch out.
[67:55.25]Rodney Bump coming in, Earl's gonna come out.
[67:58.29]All you needed to do, Earl, is pin him.
[68:01.07]And that's what your son just tried to do, and you took too long.
[68:04.89]So, you know, I would love to see an elimination.
[68:07.65]This has been a very long match.
[68:10.35]This is the longest match in Jerma Rumble history, and we have a huge deal... Oh, come on, you fucking bag of shit.
[68:18.37]What a joke.
[68:19.95]I hope he gets eliminated now.
[68:21.19]That was awful.
[68:23.19]You could have gone for like a show-stopping play right there.
[68:25.49]And that's it.
[68:26.39]You got two on one here.
[68:27.71]Harold Sludge in the ragtag.
[68:28.77]That's two.
[68:29.39]Here comes three.
[68:30.69]See you later.
[68:32.26]Rodney Vump is out.
[68:33.28]It's just Earl Vump versus the entirety of the movies.
[68:38.50]And he's currently lying on the ground outside.
[68:43.16]Being counted out.
[68:46.37]So those of you that placed your bets on the Vumps, sorry to say...
[68:50.85]I don't know if it's gonna work out and we might actually see an elimination outside.
[68:56.46]What a disgraceful display this will be if Earl Vump gets counted out.
[69:00.78]No, he doesn't want to end it that way.
[69:03.74]The gorilla reading a book does not want that to end that way.
[69:06.82]He's gonna taunt outside.
[69:08.24]Get in the ring before you get disqualified.
[69:12.36]That could have been real bad.
[69:15.85]I don't think Earl Bump is still alive.
[69:17.89]I think Earl Bump may have had, like, cardiac arrest.
[69:25.30]It's the third fucking time we've seen him do this.
[69:36.19]Say goodnight.
[69:37.61]Game over, Vumps.
[69:39.45]There's no stopping this now.
[69:40.86]Earlbump is not kicking out of this.
[69:42.10]That's one.
[69:43.22]That's two.
[69:44.34]That's three.
[69:44.96]A flawless victory by the movies.
[69:50.12]Unbelievable.
[69:52.70]They had so many chances.
[69:55.50]The Vumps had countless chances.
[69:58.25]But I guess that's what happens when three human beings go up against two fucking animals.
[70:03.73]Gorillas.
[70:05.92]And a drunk guy in fucking underwear.
[70:11.06]Sorry, Vumps.
[70:12.08]That was a very, very sad display.
[70:15.38]And with that, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for watching that tag match.
[70:18.89]And we move on to the next match of the... You got to see the crab walk three times, though.
[70:26.85]That's a good thing.
[70:32.71]Some of that shit was fucking hilarious.
[70:35.28]Harold Sludge sucks, man.
[70:37.04]All he did was run into the ref like three times.
[70:41.56]Oh, okay.
[70:43.44]Here we go.
[70:43.88]We're gonna go on to the next one.
[70:47.78]Hold on to your horses.
[70:49.72]What is this one?
[70:53.06]Oh, okay.
[70:53.62]So this... You guys already know what's gonna happen, so here it is.
[70:57.04]We'll just put it on the screen.
[70:58.94]Coming up now is, in fact...
[71:01.24]The Captain Cheez-It versus Charlie Cheez-Nips hardcore extreme rules match.
[71:09.24]My money's on Captain Cheez-It because Cheez-Its are way better.
[71:12.59]And I can't wait for Captain Cheez-It to absolutely fucking destroy Charlie Cheez-Nips.
[71:19.59]Cheez-Nips, the third ingredient is poison.
[71:21.63]We've already talked about that before.
[71:22.81]It's going to get settled once and for all.
[71:29.37]And I believe there are two more matches after this and then the rumble.
[71:35.64]So here they come.
[71:41.38]Look at that goober.
[71:42.34]Yeah, one of them's cool.
[71:43.35]The other one's just gross and sucks.
[71:48.15]Fight of the century.
[71:52.48]This is the lamest fucking thing in the whole entire stream.
[71:56.71]I was so excited for this.
[71:57.89]I got all the logos and shit.
[71:59.37]I was like, this is going to be so awesome.
[72:00.71]I'm looking at it on screen right now.
[72:03.31]Who cares?
[72:06.37]Who fucking cares?
[72:07.65]You want to get a straw poll here?
[72:08.70]Fine.
[72:09.32]We'll do a straw poll.
[72:11.34]I'm going to make a straw poll.
[72:13.32]What is the superior fucking cheese flavored snack?
[72:17.04]I'm going to cast my vote and cheese it.
[72:22.03]Let's see.
[72:23.19]Best snack.
[72:25.29]Cheese it.
[72:28.75]Or cheese nip.
[72:29.92]Let's see.
[72:32.20]We'll let the people decide.
[72:37.44]Charlie Cheese Nip.
[72:41.38]I hope they come up with like a Charlie Cheese Nip.
[72:42.72]That would make me fucking laugh my ass off.
[72:44.22]Alright, let's go.
[72:45.32]Here comes the poll.
[72:47.96]Please vote on this poll if you'd like.
[72:50.75]There it is.
[72:53.02]Who do you think is going to be the best snack?
[72:58.88]And introducing first.
[73:01.03]He doesn't need an introduction.
[73:02.21]An introduction.
[73:03.73]Captain Chee.
[73:05.61]He's currently, he's wearing the best cheese flavored snack belt.
[73:10.67]That is a real belt.
[73:12.50]He is the champion of all cheese snacks.
[73:15.60]Captain Chee, ladies and gentlemen.
[73:20.24]Captain Chee.
[73:23.44]And don't worry.
[73:25.48]Don't worry.
[73:25.90]Listen, gentlemen.
[73:27.12]It's not like Jerma gave Captain Cheez-It like 99 in all stats and Captain Cheez-Nip like 30.
[73:33.13]He deserves it.
[73:38.03]Cheez-Nips are fucking gross.
[73:41.49]And you also be ashamed if you think Cheez-Nips are better than Cheez-Its.
[73:50.26]And introducing next his opponent...
[73:52.66]His opponent coming into the ring right now, a disgusting human being.
[73:58.38]Trying to kill the American people, by the way.
[74:00.29]Turn off the lights.
[74:00.79]Here they go.
[74:05.41]But what's happening?
[74:08.85]I'm not, I don't understand.
[74:10.11]What's he holding in his hand there?
[74:11.73]What is that?
[74:12.85]I know what that is.
[74:14.76]I know what that is.
[74:16.16]That's the third ingredient in cheese nips.
[74:18.26]It's poison.
[74:19.68]I knew it.
[74:21.22]He's poisoning his body.
[74:23.04]He's getting his ingredients all ready to go.
[74:27.53]He's fucking poisoning himself.
[74:29.57]Just like all the cheese nips.
[74:30.87]Disgusting.
[74:34.91]Charlie Chee.
[74:36.63]At cheese nips.
[74:43.98]I don't even want to be in the arena right now.
[74:48.94]Lawsuit incoming.
[74:53.56]Let's get that off the screen.
[74:58.28]Hey, by the way, this is like this slander campaign brought to you by... Ring that bell.
[75:04.49]This is an extreme rules.
[75:05.41]Who has the best cheese flavored snack?
[75:07.05]Charlie Cheese Nips.
[75:08.67]Right off the bat with a scoop slam on.
[75:10.05]This is going to be fucking hard to remember these names.
[75:13.07]I'm just going to call them by their fucking cracker.
[75:15.62]I'm going to call them Cheese Nip and Cheese It.
[75:19.96]Wave goodbye to the Cheese Nip sponsor.
[75:22.95]Ooh, a low blow there.
[75:24.13]Remember, this is an extreme rules match.
[75:26.65]Anything goes.
[75:27.41]And you can go to the outside like Charlie Cheez-It.
[75:30.21]It's not his name.
[75:31.79]Just say Cheez-It.
[75:33.15]Cheez-It has got Cheez-Nibs by the neck.
[75:35.71]Scoops him down.
[75:38.88]My favorite snack is Cheez-It.
[75:40.44]Especially the Tabasco ones.
[75:41.76]And they're fucking unbelievably delicious.
[75:44.06]You should buy as much as you can possibly fit in your house.
[75:48.34]You got a spare bedroom?
[75:49.74]Fill it with Cheez-It boxes.
[75:51.48]You've got a bathroom you don't use very much?
[75:53.38]Cheez-It boxes.
[75:54.90]You've got a Cheez-It box?
[75:56.72]Buy another Cheez-It box.
[75:57.88]Put it in the Cheez-It box.
[75:59.84]As he's going to the top rope.
[76:01.80]No, he almost slipped there for a second.
[76:04.20]Cheez-Its can be a little greasy.
[76:05.76]They can be a little greasy.
[76:06.74]Cheese nips aren't as greasy, I will agree.
[76:08.49]And a giant... Wait a minute!
[76:10.61]He gets caught by Mr. Cheese Nose and throws him down to the ground.
[76:14.89]Now he's going to go on the top rope.
[76:16.92]Second rope.
[76:18.04]We all know if you go on the second rope, you're a fucking wuss.
[76:20.82]And that's what he's doing.
[76:21.72]Exactly what he's doing.
[76:24.24]Wow.
[76:24.86]Lame.
[76:26.22]That was fucking lame.
[76:29.14]It's alright though.
[76:30.60]Charlie Cheez-It is going to be able to get up and...
[76:36.16]that guy the yellow guy just did a elbow drop onto the orange guy orange guy get him orange guy got him by the no drops him into the nose his big ugly cheese it nose cheese nips nose nice miss by the way orange guy oh he gets reversed there and these are extreme rules go get something go thank you god I'm talking all this and he's going underneath the ring finally for the first time
[77:03.33]Wait, he picked up a... He picked up a kendo stick.
[77:07.98]And he is currently... No, that's a cheese stick.
[77:10.24]What am I talking about?
[77:10.88]He picked up a giant cheese stick.
[77:12.58]But he gets reversed.
[77:14.02]Remember, these are all cheese-based rules.
[77:16.93]That is a sharp cheddar cheese stick.
[77:19.93]Gets reversed.
[77:20.55]Now he's going to get thrown over it.
[77:22.21]Go for the steps.
[77:24.83]He just hit his ass on the side.
[77:30.46]Oh, go on the table.
[77:31.81]Get him on the table.
[77:32.99]Get him on the table.
[77:34.45]What are you doing?
[77:35.83]Everybody stood up.
[77:36.69]It was perfect.
[77:37.41]Holy shit.
[77:39.79]Captain Cheez-It is now on the top ropes all the way to the outside.
[77:42.79]Here comes a... No.
[77:47.83]No.
[77:48.39]Get up there.
[77:50.48]You're not in a tag match.
[77:51.66]What are you doing?
[77:53.32]He's just gone.
[77:57.06]He just got fucking wrecked, dude.
[77:59.40]And he takes a knee to the face for the trouble.
[78:02.48]He's going for a dangerously cheesy move.
[78:05.92]As Charlie Cheesnipkin throws back into the ring.
[78:09.83]I pick up the steps if I'm Captain Cheez-It.
[78:11.91]I'm not gonna lie.
[78:14.73]Right into the corner.
[78:15.53]And Captain Cheez-It is slowing down.
[78:19.01]He's getting stuck.
[78:20.54]Captain Cheez-It is too big.
[78:22.28]So he gets stuck.
[78:23.18]And now Charlie Cheez-Nips has him up in a pile driver.
[78:26.89]Captain Cheez-It is not in a good spot right now.
[78:31.51]If CharlieCheeseNips wins this, I'm gonna be very upset.
[78:35.13]He's on the top ropes!
[78:36.97]He's taunting!
[78:37.97]He's saying number one, here's the jump drop!
[78:40.45]Dude, sometimes, you guys wonder why, like, how, like, commentating this shit, like, trying to, like, like, cast this, so, like, in quotes.
[78:51.86]Look at what the fuck I'm watching on the screen!
[78:53.62]This shit is so stupid!
[78:57.08]Like, it's like, what the fuck am I doing?
[79:01.49]Anyways, we have, he's now in a big right hand into a fall on your back and then you fall on me move.
[79:07.69]That's his finishing move.
[79:09.11]One.
[79:10.19]Two.
[79:10.57]This is it.
[79:11.45]No, just barely Charlie Cheese Nips with a little bit of strength.
[79:15.07]Just barely gets out.
[79:17.92]Piledriver is a banned move.
[79:19.30]That is correct.
[79:21.20]That is correct.
[79:24.10]It's all scripted.
[79:26.04]You mean I tried to script this one.
[79:28.73]And we'll see.
[79:29.19]Here comes the script.
[79:30.37]One.
[79:31.37]Two.
[79:32.45]No.
[79:33.63]Charlie Cheesnips does not want to go down without a fight.
[79:38.27]Against all odds.
[79:40.51]Big elbow drop onto the chest area.
[79:43.96]And do you see the athleticism of the Cheez-It?
[79:47.08]If you eat Cheez-Its, you can go work out for like three hours.
[79:49.48]One.
[79:49.76]Two.
[79:50.12]No.
[79:50.86]Stop going for pins.
[79:51.68]Get him in a suplex and drop him on his fucking head.
[79:55.32]Submission move.
[79:56.32]This could be it.
[79:58.49]No, he's reversing it.
[80:00.49]And he got up.
[80:01.05]Charlie Cheesnips is actually awake now.
[80:03.25]Gets a kick to the stomach.
[80:04.17]A little slap-splash DDT.
[80:10.17]Cheezit just won't stop pinning.
[80:12.15]One, two... Captain Cheezit, you have to go for, like, a move.
[80:17.69]You can't just, like, put your fucking... Like, his head between your legs.
[80:21.31]And expect him to lose.
[80:24.93]Now this could be it.
[80:26.59]I smell...
[80:28.33]the end here.
[80:28.79]Ooh!
[80:31.65]You saw the red flash on the screen, that means he's bleeding!
[80:34.89]But you can't, but Cheese, Cheese doesn't have any blood.
[80:37.53]So you can't bleed.
[80:38.21]Just a little bit of Cheese, a little bit of Cheese came out of his nose there for one second.
[80:43.98]He's got like Cheese dripping down his face.
[80:49.48]Blood!
[80:51.84]Now he's going for a suplex.
[80:53.88]He got it and he, he bunched his legs up on the top ropes there.
[80:59.32]I love how he just keeps getting stuck on the ropes.
[81:03.47]Hey, go to extreme rules match, guys.
[81:06.33]It's almost like you're fucking cheese crackers.
[81:08.29]Do something interesting for fuck's sake.
[81:10.97]I speak so soon.
[81:11.91]Gets him on the top.
[81:12.65]Come on.
[81:13.10]End it here.
[81:14.22]Show everybody why toasted fucking Tabasco cheese is the best.
[81:17.50]Here it is.
[81:17.94]Backwards Hurricane Rana.
[81:18.88]Nope.
[81:19.16]Backwards Jerma Suplex.
[81:20.62]On his neck.
[81:21.16]Kill him.
[81:22.64]I hope he's dead.
[81:23.96]He hurt himself.
[81:25.91]That's it.
[81:28.06]End this facade once and for all.
[81:29.58]Pin this motherfucker.
[81:33.40]Two elbow drops.
[81:34.56]Three elbow drops.
[81:36.02]Four elbow drops.
[81:37.66]Five elbow drops.
[81:39.22]This is six elbow drops.
[81:40.86]This is seven.
[81:52.40]Fucking please pin him.
[81:59.55]Oh, he's so dumb.
[82:04.26]And now the showboating is gonna get him piledrived again.
[82:06.96]Charlie Cheese!
[82:07.68]Oh, he killed him!
[82:09.82]He's bleeding.
[82:11.00]Oh no, extra cheese on his face!
[82:17.71]They both have cheese dripping off of their face like they're at a movie theater nacho bar.
[82:24.47]No, and this, oh, here we go.
[82:26.32]Charlie Cheese Nip is now going for the extreme rules.
[82:29.24]What kind of cheese-related item is he going to pick out of the bottom here?
[82:32.40]Oh, my God, it's a cheese grater.
[82:34.98]He's got the cheese grater.
[82:36.97]This is going to be devastating for fucking Captain Cheese It.
[82:40.21]Oh, he dodged it.
[82:41.21]What a Dark Souls dodge, and he ripped the fucking chair out of his hands.
[82:45.11]I mean, the cheese grater.
[82:47.23]Onto the ground.
[82:49.80]Didn't even need to use the chair.
[82:52.02]One!
[82:52.96]Two!
[82:54.30]Three!
[82:54.60]That's it!
[83:00.58]That's it!
[83:01.98]Captain Cheez-It wins!
[83:04.80]The downfall was going to get the item underneath the chair!
[83:08.52]Underneath the ring!
[83:12.03]Ah, Charlie Cheez-Nip!
[83:13.37]Unbelievable!
[83:14.19]Too bad you're the worst cheese-flavored snack!
[83:17.75]Cheez-Its are always gonna be better!
[83:20.94]If he had hit him with the chair, though, for real, one chair shot to Captain Cheez-It, and he probably could have pinned him in one.
[83:29.48]Probably.
[83:30.67]Didn't happen, though.
[83:33.35]There you go.
[83:34.21]Let's see.
[83:34.45]Let's look at the poll.
[83:37.21]Cheez-It.
[83:38.61]70% thought Cheez-It was going to win.
[83:40.17]30% thought Cheez-Nips was going to win.
[83:43.21]Well, that is true.
[83:52.62]I've got like an ad popping up in my computer.
[83:54.74]Hold on.
[83:58.50]I have like a fucking wrong certificate in Google Chrome.
[84:01.02]I don't give a shit.
[84:01.78]Get out of here.
[84:05.06]Get out of here.
[84:08.86]Alright, so here we go.
[84:10.04]We're going to move on to the next match.
[84:12.25]Oh god, it's not even a match.
[84:15.43]Oh no.
[84:16.57]I thought this was going to be funny.
[84:17.61]This is not funny.
[84:18.25]We're skipping it.
[84:20.47]Yeah, we're skipping this.
[84:22.37]Nothing about this is gonna be funny.
[84:25.59]I did this to, like, kill some time.
[84:34.44]No, no, no, don't skip it.
[84:36.24]It's not funny.
[84:38.76]I forgot I couldn't, like, delete this and how it's, like, still... Fine.
[84:41.72]We'll see.
[84:44.06]No skips, no rewind.
[84:46.92]Okay.
[84:48.50]If you say so.
[84:50.17]I will do that.
[84:52.69]Anyways, let me see.
[84:54.81]Again, notifications are off.
[84:57.13]So, let me just catch up with some of the people that gave a lot of fucking money.
[85:03.26]Vengeful Cheez-It gave $5 and says, fuck cheese nips.
[85:08.90]Well, thank you.
[85:09.38]Thanks for the $5.
[85:10.72]Vengeful Cheez-It.
[85:12.57]Mostly lost.
[85:13.13]Thanks for the $20.
[85:15.98]Uh, he made like a Harambe joke earlier.
[85:18.38]I mean, it's inevitable.
[85:21.94]Thanks for the 20 bucks.
[85:23.08]Mostly lost, again.
[85:25.32]The Orange Pyro, thanks for the bits, mostly lost $50 that I missed from earlier.
[85:34.35]Thank you.
[85:34.75]It says Team Cheez-It.
[85:36.01]I have a lot of Team Cheez-Its.
[85:37.53]That's good.
[85:40.25]It's the rematch.
[85:41.37]It is not the rematch.
[85:49.09]Yeah, the, uh... Hold on a second.
[85:53.45]Did I miss two other people?
[85:57.05]No.
[85:57.65]Most of the last $50.
[85:58.63]Team Cheez-It.
[85:59.03]Thanks a lot, dude.
[85:59.65]Thank you so much.
[86:01.65]Uh, my Twitch alerts got kind of fucked up.
[86:03.42]Hold on.
[86:06.18]Okay.
[86:07.44]Okay.
[86:07.92]There we go.
[86:09.58]Ready to go.
[86:10.22]Here it comes.
[86:10.70]Here comes the thing that's not funny.
[86:14.06]Hope you're ready.
[86:15.56]Here it comes.
[86:19.66]I want to skip this so bad, but we can't.
[86:24.73]Oh, here comes Dr. Roker.
[86:26.89]I wonder what Dr. Roker has to say.
[86:28.33]He's coming to the ring.
[86:28.97]He's a fan favorite.
[86:29.67]Everyone loves Dr. Roker.
[86:33.77]A veteran of the Jerma wrestling arena.
[86:39.46]Not funny.
[86:40.96]Let's preface that by saying he's coming out here to say a couple of words.
[86:44.78]I wonder what he has to say.
[86:48.78]It's always great to come out here and address the WWE Jerma universe in person.
[86:52.66]No matter what I have to say, you're always ready to listen.
[86:55.49]Believe me, that's a good thing.
[86:56.83]Because, man, do I have some things to say tonight.
[87:00.29]Yes, it's a whole lot of things that I have to say.
[87:02.77]Ever since I was a kid, I've wished for this moment.
[87:05.83]To have the best baking soda in the world, to be the best superstar in the world, and give 100% of every night and every dollar in this ring.
[87:12.92]But be careful what you wish for.
[87:14.10]Things have got to change around here.
[87:16.46]That's right.
[87:19.40]I'm sick and tired of being a nice guy.
[87:22.02]I'm a fucking bad guy now.
[87:23.56]This was a heel turn.
[87:25.38]Dr. Roker comes out and talks a bunch of shit to the crowd and he becomes a bad guy.
[87:32.99]I can't skip it.
[87:40.75]Yeah, fuck you.
[87:41.49]I'm a bad guy now.
[87:45.32]Please in 2k 18 allow that would have been bad.
[87:50.30]We're good Okay, no more promos I promise oh God I fucking forgot about it And the next one is coming up here we go Fucking copy written music now the next one is
[88:14.39]The writers fucked up this season.
[88:18.22]Bigger heel turn than the shield break up.
[88:21.34]Those promos are such a means to an end.
[88:23.70]It's terrible.
[88:26.12]I wish they had even a shred of the type of story content you can put in the other games.
[88:33.73]And even like 1% 2k.
[88:35.57]Like, what the fuck?
[88:37.49]Holy shit.
[88:40.07]Okay, this next one is a triple threat table match.
[88:44.89]This one could go any number of ways.
[88:50.58]Any number of ways.
[88:53.44]But, uh, make sure we remove this copywritten song when we, uh, when we have the video go up on YouTube.
[89:04.40]I miss story creator.
[89:05.36]I do too.
[89:07.75]2K sucks ass and hates fun.
[89:11.20]Well, I guess we can all say a silent prayer for THQ.
[89:14.98]Considering that THQ had the rights to the franchise, WWE.
[89:19.88]And when they dissolved, they lost everything to, obviously, 2K.
[89:25.14]And then 2K went on to make these games.
[89:27.82]And they've been really bad.
[89:31.56]Hey, are we at a loading screen?
[89:34.36]So should I talk more shit about 2K?
[89:38.42]This is, hey, when the game loads, make fun of the company that you're playing the game in.
[89:42.31]Alright, almost there.
[89:46.87]THQ is dead.
[89:47.35]Yeah, it's unfortunate.
[89:53.95]It is unfortunate, but that's just the way it is.
[89:59.42]Do a THQ versus 2K match.
[90:05.10]Where's the pencil?
[90:07.25]Uh, he's in another game.
[90:08.65]Alright, here we go.
[90:10.67]This one, hopefully, will be interesting.
[90:12.31]Let's get it started.
[90:17.13]I already know who people are gonna want to win.
[90:19.13]But that don't matter, I know who I want.
[90:21.57]Welcome back.
[90:22.44]Uh, this is gonna be a triple threat table match.
[90:25.86]Tables are at either side, and the first contestant is going to be... The grandmother from SWAT Police Quest!
[90:34.86]The lady that shows up and shoots the gun!
[90:37.69]Granny from SWAT.
[90:40.97]By the way, this is a FMV only character.
[90:45.64]Three-way brawl.
[90:49.10]So the three characters in this are from FMV games only.
[90:54.22]Here's Granny in the bathroom.
[90:56.70]The gun grandmother, whatever you want to call her.
[90:59.70]She's fucking vicious.
[91:04.20]She could be anywhere too, by the way.
[91:07.75]I'm not sure.
[91:08.91]Holy shit.
[91:10.34]I forgot how ugly she was.
[91:12.38]I forgot how ugly she were.
[91:13.48]Alright, the next contestant coming up is somebody that a lot of you are probably going to like.
[91:20.12]At least I think so.
[91:23.86]I hope so.
[91:25.56]From Mad Dog McCree.
[91:28.22]And all the Mad Dog McCree games.
[91:30.62]It's the Old Prospector.
[91:35.92]Famous lines include, you missed that one, try another.
[91:41.20]He's here to give himself a try in the Jerma wrestling arena.
[91:47.39]Fun fact, you can't have cowboy hats on in the game.
[91:52.25]He has to have a shitty Pied Piper hat on.
[91:56.19]Cowboy hats aren't allowed to wear in the ring.
[92:01.39]He's fired up, and so am I.
[92:04.48]And the final contestant in the triple threat is not a cage match, it's a table match.
[92:11.18]I want to see if you guys know, of course you're going to know who it is.
[92:15.15]But I'm wondering if you guys know the name.
[92:18.25]Just by the looks alone, you're going to know who it is, because that's from Wirehead.
[92:21.81]There he is.
[92:22.33]The fucking dweeb.
[92:30.41]There's... Ned Hubbard from Wirehead.
[92:36.91]He's just a regular guy.
[92:38.27]That's like pretty much all it is with glasses.
[92:41.39]That's it.
[92:42.43]He was the easiest character to make.
[92:43.81]Uh, better play.
[92:49.67]I am not controlling any of the characters.
[92:52.45]He's currently talking to the player controlling him right now.
[92:55.22]You can't see, he's talking over his shoulder.
[92:56.62]The human-controlled person is over there.
[93:02.38]Play as wired.
[93:07.59]Okay, here we go.
[93:09.31]Let's start it.
[93:12.45]We got Granny.
[93:14.01]We got the Prospector.
[93:15.69]And we've got Wirehead.
[93:20.09]And right off the bat, Granny goes for Wirehead immediately.
[93:23.63]While the old Prospector is instantly going for one of the tables.
[93:27.17]He's just bringing it in.
[93:28.85]We haven't even started.
[93:29.79]Vicious grandmother.
[93:30.67]I told you she was vicious.
[93:32.56]Almost passes the table to the grandmother.
[93:34.28]What?
[93:34.80]She's trying to use it as a weapon.
[93:35.76]He's going back outside.
[93:36.60]He's going to get the other table.
[93:38.76]We just started.
[93:40.40]And already, they're getting a fucking table.
[93:43.39]He's not even participating.
[93:44.93]They're going to break it.
[93:45.57]Don't break it already.
[93:46.33]Oh my god, that sounded like it hurt.
[93:49.05]Right in the back of grandma's head.
[93:51.59]Both tables are in the ring already.
[93:53.45]They're just boards there.
[93:55.67]The prospector is so desperate to set one of these tables up.
[93:59.02]It's remarkable he actually could even...
[94:03.18]The prospector is just going ape shit on both Ned Wirehead and the grandmother prospector right in the elbow of her mouth.
[94:09.89]I thought just Ned was taking his pants down.
[94:13.11]I really thought the Wirehead Ned was going to pull his pants off.
[94:15.71]But no, that's not the case.
[94:17.01]Granny's going on the top ropes immediately.
[94:18.99]She's jumping to nothing.
[94:22.37]She's out.
[94:26.12]Okay.
[94:26.90]Well, good job, Granny.
[94:28.16]That was a death-defying move in the top ropes.
[94:32.08]Both tables are in the ring.
[94:36.14]I'm surprised nobody's tried to attempt to use one.
[94:39.30]Well, the Prospector did.
[94:42.13]Grandma's just barely getting to her senses.
[94:43.81]Well, here comes a table setting up.
[94:44.91]Maybe... Oh, he just walked into him.
[94:48.91]He just gouged Grandma's neck with that table.
[94:51.91]That went into her neck.
[94:54.07]That was literally dead.
[94:55.23]Dead.
[94:55.43]You're literally dead if you do that to somebody.
[94:57.66]Grandma gets hit in the face again with the corner side of the table.
[95:01.80]Oh, two good Dark Souls rolls.
[95:03.42]Not enough to get away from the Prospector.
[95:06.78]His grandma has taken some real heat here.
[95:08.68]And now, Wirehead has the table.
[95:11.04]He's setting it up in the corner.
[95:13.18]While the other two are distracted, he's gonna grab him into the corner!
[95:16.45]Oh!
[95:22.18]The Prospector just pretty much walked into a door.
[95:25.14]That's the extent of the damage that Ned Wirehead did to the Prospector.
[95:29.26]But now he gets him in a DDT.
[95:30.44]Oh, double team here?
[95:31.86]We have some collusion with Gra- Grandma does a nice reversal there.
[95:39.02]Gets reversed herself.
[95:40.84]Somebody's going into that table.
[95:45.35]Wow, she's an old woman for Christ's sake.
[95:47.67]Come on.
[95:49.01]Could you be any more dastardly?
[95:50.89]She's a 96-year-old woman.
[95:54.33]Prospector again getting thrown into the door.
[95:56.25]And he misses the dropkick.
[95:57.51]But he's stuck on the corner.
[95:58.51]This is not good for the Prospector.
[95:59.93]No, he didn't react fast enough.
[96:02.95]And now Ned goes into the corner.
[96:05.24]Getting pushed.
[96:05.72]No, he reverses it.
[96:06.52]Thank goodness.
[96:08.15]Ooh, whoopsie, ow, my head.
[96:10.19]While Grandma's got the other table in her hands.
[96:12.87]She has a million years while these two just trade throw into the door.
[96:16.46]Grandma's got the table, she's gonna set it up in the middle of the ring.
[96:21.60]And now she has the Prospector.
[96:23.88]Is she gonna put him on the... No, he reverses it.
[96:26.24]Oh, come on!
[96:31.51]That would really hurt.
[96:34.31]She just got the corner of a table in her back.
[96:38.79]Ugh.
[96:39.95]That would hurt so bad.
[96:42.53]As the Prospector now... Oh, he just misses with the knee as Wirehead is having lots of issues outside on the apron.
[96:50.23]Thrown into the door again.
[96:52.89]You know, I don't think that would even hurt.
[96:55.17]This would hurt less than getting thrown into the turnbuckle.
[96:58.07]The turnbuckle, you get like scraped on the ropes.
[97:01.11]As Grandma's doing her best Dracula impression.
[97:04.03]Like a fucking person in a coffin.
[97:06.19]Smiling.
[97:07.80]As Wirehead is trying to set the table up in the middle of the ring.
[97:10.10]Oh no, another corner table?
[97:12.48]No, he gave up.
[97:13.36]He don't care.
[97:13.74]He doesn't give a shit about that.
[97:18.47]Grandma's going back into the corner again.
[97:20.39]Oh, she's in trouble.
[97:23.27]Ned Wirehead picks up Grandma and a POWER BOMB!
[97:25.89]Into the table and it just explodes.
[97:28.15]Wait, what?
[97:29.47]Wait, what?
[97:30.37]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[97:31.91]Wait, what happened?
[97:33.23]Hold on, is that it?
[97:38.19]Wait, it's the first person to go through a table?
[97:42.11]Hold on a second.
[97:43.07]There was a fucking thousand opportunities.
[97:46.81]That's all it takes?
[97:52.60]Grandma's dead.
[97:53.64]This kills her.
[97:55.64]That's the objective of the match.
[98:00.12]I thought it was just tables were around.
[98:02.58]Okay, well, Ned Wirehead is your winner.
[98:05.97]Grandma is actually dead.
[98:09.15]You can't pick up a fucking 92-year-old woman and throw her into a table and have her not be dead.
[98:15.15]That's the second death of Drew Manning in 2017's Dream Edition.
[98:19.94]Sluggo and Grandma.
[98:21.26]She ain't never coming back.
[98:22.88]I can guarantee you that.
[98:25.60]On to the next match.
[98:28.88]On to the next one.
[98:31.77]Oh God, I fucking forgot about this one.
[98:36.34]Okay.
[98:37.88]Get ready.
[98:38.98]This is the final match before the Rumble.
[98:42.58]And it has potential to be the best one.
[98:48.74]So, welcome again, everybody, to Jeremy actively tries to get sued on stream.
[98:55.45]That's pretty much what we're doing.
[98:57.35]Especially with this one.
[99:08.87]we're almost ready this is a hell in a cell this is a three-person hell in a cell one of these characters is just so there's a story behind one of these characters is in this and it's because of a certain particular reason and I'll tell you later
[99:37.56]Remember, there's a lot of characters that are only going to appear in the Rumble.
[99:41.15]These preliminary matches are leading up to the Rumble, a 30-person Rumble.
[99:44.95]There's a bunch of people that you will only see in the Rumble.
[99:48.45]Make sure you keep that in mind.
[99:53.92]Tell us when we're older.
[100:00.04]No, it is not Comcast.
[100:05.17]Is the Rumble today?
[100:07.09]Yeah, the rumble is in like 20 minutes.
[100:10.79]Not even.
[100:13.61]Will there ever be another in real life rumble?
[100:15.41]Yes.
[100:16.99]Absolutely.
[100:19.66]A 100% guarantee.
[100:21.14]Yes.
[100:23.48]And it's going to be way better.
[100:25.16]There you go.
[100:29.48]Almost there.
[100:30.12]This one has a lot of assets to load apparently.
[100:35.45]It's already been an hour and 45 minutes.
[100:38.45]Okay.
[100:40.25]Here we go.
[100:41.47]Triple threat Hell in a Cell.
[100:49.29]Welcome back.
[100:51.21]This Hell in a Cell cage has dropped after all participants have entered the ring.
[100:55.39]The first contestant getting booed to shit because he's not a good character.
[101:02.34]He's a loser.
[101:03.02]Oh, wait a minute.
[101:03.64]Oh, shit.
[101:05.34]It's a censor bar!
[101:09.97]Censor bar's coming out first!
[101:11.79]Apparently.
[101:12.99]Here comes the censor bar!
[101:16.05]Alright!
[101:18.17]Making his way into the arena for the first time and last time ever.
[101:23.16]Ah, the censor bar.
[101:28.96]Well, might as well... The cat's out of the bag, as they say.
[101:31.96]Ladies and gentlemen, the next contestant...
[101:36.27]It's got to be.
[101:42.71]Yeah, you know, the cat's out of the bag.
[101:44.41]I'm going to say that joke one more time.
[101:46.87]There he comes.
[101:50.28]Getting cheered.
[101:52.54]Getting cheered.
[101:53.26]It's Garfield.
[101:55.06]Jim Davis is Garfield.
[101:56.96]From Garfield and Friends.
[102:00.92]There he is.
[102:02.04]He looks a little tired.
[102:03.02]Looks like he woke up on the wrong side of the lasagna this morning.
[102:07.16]Taking his way slowly into the ring.
[102:10.80]As he strolls down.
[102:12.25]There he is, that fat shit.
[102:17.53]Unfunny fucking cartoon character, Garfield.
[102:23.12]I hate Mondays.
[102:24.10]No ears.
[102:35.86]Yeah.
[102:37.30]And it's a triple threat.
[102:38.60]You know, it's a triple threat.
[102:39.44]There's another person coming in.
[102:43.28]Could you understand?
[102:44.58]Could you take a guess who that other person is?
[102:47.95]Not who you think it's.
[102:48.79]No, it's not John.
[102:51.45]Not John.
[103:01.40]Here comes the last character.
[103:02.94]And here comes the final character in this one!
[103:05.68]The third character is Garfield!
[103:08.52]James Garfield!
[103:10.02]The fuckin' 34th president of the United States!
[103:14.91]It's fuckin' Garfield versus Garfield!
[103:23.63]Alright, so what was supposed to happen?
[103:26.24]Let me break it down for you.
[103:27.94]It was supposed to be Garfield versus Garfield.
[103:30.98]And then mid-match, the censor bar was supposed to interrupt the match and beat up Garfield.
[103:37.39]But guess what?
[103:38.79]We're in WWE 2K17.
[103:42.05]You can't do that.
[103:44.31]So now they're just in the fucking ring at the same damn time.
[103:47.05]Garfield versus Garfield.
[103:48.27]It's a fucking 18-plus match.
[103:49.73]There's going to be a lot of sex in this one.
[103:52.81]Here we go!
[103:54.27]Triple threat Hell in a Cell.
[103:56.03]Censor bar.
[103:57.39]Garfield is really perusing that sensor bar.
[103:59.36]Really didn't like what he saw there.
[104:02.04]Censor bar is just kind of sitting outside.
[104:06.24]In this triple threat match.
[104:07.40]Well, he is just a sensor bar.
[104:10.30]Doesn't really have any moves programmed.
[104:13.97]As James... I almost just said James Comey.
[104:17.64]That's James Comey Garfield.
[104:19.38]We're talking politics.
[104:21.12]Nice backflip there.
[104:22.00]The sensor bar getting in here.
[104:23.11]Oh, that might have been a little too 18+.
[104:24.43]I think I just saw Garfield's dick, and he's not happy about that.
[104:27.97]The sensor bar!
[104:29.25]Trying to clean this stream up a little bit.
[104:31.93]No, he just dodged out of the way.
[104:35.52]Scoop slam onto the sensor bar.
[104:37.46]Fuck the sensors, says James Garfield.
[104:40.94]Now Garfield is grabbing Garfield, throwing Garfield.
[104:44.12]Coming back and... No, he just... He's gonna go into the stomach.
[104:47.99]And gonna get Garfield in the nuts, apparently.
[104:52.53]Clean set.
[104:54.17]And Garfield just falls on the outside having like some type of mental issue over there.
[104:58.41]He like kind of was shaking.
[105:00.37]Ooh, two of the free kicks.
[105:05.19]Garfield is now going to the top ropes.
[105:07.79]Taunting the sensor bar.
[105:10.89]As Garfield is now coming in.
[105:11.99]Garfield with a... Trying to go for a head drop.
[105:14.83]Trying to kick him, but I don't... I have no idea.
[105:16.88]I can't even fucking do this right now.
[105:20.46]It's like too much for my brain to hit.
[105:22.32]Oh, God.
[105:28.07]So, Garfield going for... I think the sensor bar has zero stats, by the way.
[105:35.41]That might be possible.
[105:38.11]No, no, he's gonna block it.
[105:39.55]Pick him up.
[105:40.49]His suplex onto his back.
[105:43.23]As Garfield now is outside, coming back in.
[105:46.27]Belly-to-belly suplex onto the sensor bar.
[105:49.15]Gar- Garfield just fucking smashed his face in the ground so hard.
[105:56.17]Nice block by Garfield!
[105:58.78]Fireman's carry onto Garfield.
[106:01.86]Scoop slam now.
[106:02.70]No, Garfield reverses it.
[106:04.62]Reverse DDT onto Garfield.
[106:06.84]As the sensor bar is just barely getting up.
[106:08.62]I wish they would utilize the cell here.
[106:11.64]You can do some like... ...moves.
[106:14.18]I mean the cell is there for a reason.
[106:15.64]Now climb it.
[106:17.26]Get on top of that cell.
[106:18.32]Make something happen.
[106:20.94]What the fuck are you doing?
[106:22.18]He just did like the worm.
[106:24.92]He's going for a pin.
[106:28.04]Is James Garfield going to win right now?
[106:30.82]This too?
[106:32.24]Oh, he just barely broke it up.
[106:33.55]Garfield just broke it up.
[106:35.13]Barely.
[106:37.03]As James Garfield now gets the receiving end.
[106:39.11]And now Garfield's going for the pin.
[106:42.58]One.
[106:44.80]Spencer Parr looks like Pepsi, man.
[106:49.78]I wish somebody would climb the cage.
[106:58.31]He's gonna break his neck.
[106:59.69]Garfield's about to kill the censor and break his neck.
[107:02.37]James Garfield has to get up and get in there right now or this is over.
[107:05.75]Oh, wow, the censor bar just barely broke out of that.
[107:11.65]He just went for a fucking giant, like, cotton candy kick.
[107:15.28]But he missed and then got kicked in the face.
[107:19.68]Alright, take it outside, gentlemen.
[107:21.34]Come on.
[107:23.06]They're getting booed right now.
[107:24.94]I'd be booing too.
[107:26.63]What is he doing?
[107:27.49]He's placing him upside down.
[107:30.43]And now James Garfield is climbing up on top.
[107:33.50]On his... On his... He just stuffed him in the chest.
[107:38.68]From the top, bro.
[107:40.20]Never seen that move before.
[107:44.03]Scoop slam into... No.
[107:47.01]Right into the turnbuckle.
[107:47.97]This could be it.
[107:48.57]The sensor bar can't win.
[107:49.87]Don't win.
[107:50.87]Don't win.
[107:51.23]This could be the worst match ever.
[107:52.25]Thank God.
[107:55.05]Should've had Andrew.
[107:57.06]Who's Andrew Garfield?
[108:00.06]Sensor bar going to the top ropes.
[108:02.36]Taunting James Garfield, looking for a high flying maneuver.
[108:05.44]He's gonna get it.
[108:06.44]He's just gonna sit there.
[108:07.62]Right into the back.
[108:10.79]James Comey.
[108:11.81]James Comey!
[108:12.95]James Garfield wasn't even paying attention.
[108:14.67]Reversal now into a DDT.
[108:17.45]As the sensor bar is... Now everyone's outside.
[108:21.65]Dude, go out there and climb the fucking cage.
[108:25.71]I want to see Garfield get on top of the cage.
[108:29.54]Like, how badly do you guys want to see that?
[108:33.10]Nice Jerma suplex there from Garfield under the censor block.
[108:35.54]Like, all it takes is, like, for James Garfield to get up there and fucking just dropkick onto everybody on top.
[108:46.87]That's a pretty good thing there.
[108:48.13]Pretty good thing there.
[108:50.69]Right hand into Garfield's face.
[108:52.61]Got him at a DDT.
[108:53.19]Gets reversed.
[108:53.73]A knee in the stomach.
[108:54.39]The censor bar is not getting up.
[108:56.95]I really would be surprised if we got a sensor bar.
[108:59.15]No, no, no, no.
[109:03.05]James Garfield now has a lot of strength.
[109:04.61]He's going to throw everybody outside here.
[109:06.92]Hopefully they take it outside.
[109:09.82]I want to see it so bad.
[109:11.86]Every time there's somebody lying out there, there's an opportunity to go out there.
[109:17.76]But Senator fucking Garfield doesn't feel like going out there.
[109:24.20]Well, now we get a good move.
[109:26.40]Do it.
[109:27.64]Huge, huge move.
[109:29.50]Doesn't pin him.
[109:32.02]What are you doing?
[109:33.26]He got up to pin him.
[109:34.34]This is going to be close.
[109:35.36]One, two.
[109:37.22]That's it.
[109:38.32]James Garfield wins.
[109:43.10]Garfield.
[109:44.18]Regular Garfield was too lazy to go out there.
[109:48.25]Get on that fucking cage.
[109:49.63]What's the point of the cage if you won't climb it, you fucking idiots?
[109:53.66]That was an awesome move, though.
[109:57.31]James Garfield wins the Garfield Showdown.
[110:02.57]Beautiful display.
[110:06.21]By the way, James Garfield was in office for like three months before he died.
[110:10.62]Something like that.
[110:11.32]I have no idea.
[110:11.84]I'm pretty sure James Garfield died within like two months of being in office.
[110:16.68]At least he got this, right?
[110:17.74]That's pretty sick.
[110:22.29]Alright.
[110:24.54]Here we go.
[110:25.64]Here's what you all came here for.
[110:26.78]Here's the whole point of everyone showing up in the first place.
[110:32.70]Here comes the 30-person stream rumble.
[110:38.57]Place your bets on who you think is going to win.
[110:39.79]A lot of these characters are going to be in it.
[110:41.61]Some of them aren't.
[110:43.91]It is time.
[110:45.63]It is time for the rumble.
[110:49.93]You have as long as it takes to load the rumble, which could be a pretty long time because there are fucking 30 characters.
[111:01.27]Good thing I have the BRB screen on because I can see them alright now.
[111:04.82]A couple of old faces, some new faces, and some obviously people you've already seen.
[111:22.68]So while we have a second, let me just say a special thank you to Luke the Loot Breaker for the bits.
[111:29.75]Mostly lost again with $50.
[111:31.73]That's like almost $200 fucking dollars tonight.
[111:35.07]Thanks a lot, man.
[111:36.87]Stix Renegade for the $10.
[111:37.81]There's been a lot of money today.
[111:42.61]All I can say is thanks.
[111:45.55]I forgot he was in this.
[111:46.49]I'm looking at it right now.
[111:47.48]There's like six or seven people I think you guys haven't seen.
[111:49.90]That's good.
[111:51.32]That's a good thing.
[111:53.81]Uh, Vic Vinegar, thanks for the $5.
[111:54.91]It's been so long since the Jerma Rumble.
[111:59.17]I'm glad it's back.
[111:59.79]You should do some commentary on Jay Buffay's voice.
[112:04.60]The one thing I'll tell you when I do, like, these on stream is, like, if something's, like, funny or something's insane, I fucking, like, I can't, I can't, I can't even talk.
[112:14.49]It's hard to talk and watch this because I don't know what the fuck's gonna happen.
[112:18.73]All I do is make the characters and make, like, the quote scenarios.
[112:23.14]The stupid AI does this shit.
[112:27.62]Sometimes it's outrageous.
[112:30.30]But there are 5,100 people here.
[112:32.00]Thanks, everybody, for being here.
[112:34.93]Hopefully you're enjoying yourselves.
[112:38.03]And here we go.
[112:39.91]The rumble is right now.
[112:46.53]Who are the first two contestants?
[112:51.51]There's a lady in the ring.
[112:52.31]That's not a contestant.
[112:54.03]I think she's going over the rules.
[112:59.07]Just in case you don't know the rules, if you get thrown over the top ropes, you'll lose.
[113:04.07]You're eliminated.
[113:05.15]That's it.
[113:07.23]Who are the first two characters?
[113:10.92]I love everybody that just saw this lady and were like, oh, wow, I wonder who this is.
[113:15.94]What character is this?
[113:25.58]Any second now, first contestant will come up.
[113:28.26]Here they come.
[113:31.26]We got a nice WWE loading logo.
[113:35.96]Who do you think that is?
[113:37.84]Coming up on his motorcycle.
[113:39.76]BDDBB.
[113:41.60]Bootleg Duck Dynasty, yeah, Batman.
[113:45.87]I'm wondering... Who Bootleg Duck Dynasty B.I.
[113:50.19]Batman is.
[113:52.11]I play Batman on stream and shit.
[113:54.33]I play Duck Dynasty on stream.
[113:57.01]B.I.
[113:57.33]has to be in every Rumble.
[113:59.49]It's just a fucking combination of three characters.
[114:01.87]Who cares?
[114:02.25]He's gonna lose.
[114:03.95]Please welcome B.D.D.B.B.
[114:06.85]To the Rumble for the first time ever.
[114:10.79]Bootleg Duck Dynasty B.I.
[114:13.05]Batman.
[114:16.66]Slowly making his way down.
[114:22.59]This is a promising start.
[114:24.17]Pretty much.
[114:27.17]BDDBB is not gonna win.
[114:29.21]Who's fucking... I thought some guy was coming down.
[114:34.43]You want B... No, you don't want BDDBB to win.
[114:39.05]I love how silent he's being, too.
[114:48.86]At least this guy won't win.
[114:52.46]Weirder things have happened.
[114:55.30]So who is his initial starting opponent?
[114:58.39]We will find out.
[114:59.29]Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome... I don't know who it is.
[115:05.59]It's somebody.
[115:07.93]It's someone.
[115:08.57]Look at that smile.
[115:09.55]He's like... I was so serious, but now I'm happy.
[115:14.94]His opponent... The first two is PlayStation VR!
[115:18.82]PSVR is the second contestant.
[115:22.00]And the JermaStream Rumble 2017 really fired up.
[115:26.20]As you saw earlier tonight, he and his VR guy got the better of Jerma.
[115:31.99]He's really talking, he's talking about how he's the best VR system.
[115:36.33]He's trying to tell everybody in the audience to go buy a PSVR.
[115:39.25]See the cords?
[115:39.97]He was touching the cords saying, just wait for the fucking long cord attachment that's coming out in 2019.
[115:43.16]No, no, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[115:51.79]PlayStation VR if you weren't here earlier.
[115:54.65]Too many fucking cords.
[115:56.13]Cables everywhere.
[115:58.61]You are the first two.
[116:01.71]So get the PSVR and bootleg Duck Dynasty VR Batman.
[116:09.43]Here we go.
[116:11.56]This guy fucking sucks.
[116:16.19]Start that fucking siren.
[116:18.27]Ring that bell.
[116:18.95]Here we go.
[116:19.45]Welcome.
[116:20.29]This is what you waited for.
[116:21.21]Right off the bat, a snap suplex onto the PSVR by bootleg Duck Dynasty VR Batman.
[116:25.38]Nobody's there to grab BDDBB.
[116:29.06]We could see an instant elimination of the PSVR.
[116:31.80]Got to be careful of those cords, though.
[116:32.84]You'll get tangled up on those cords.
[116:34.06]Got them over the top rope immediately.
[116:36.46]PSVR is going to be gone.
[116:37.80]No.
[116:38.64]Just barely stops that there.
[116:41.22]Duck Dynasty bootleg fat fuck Batman has got him now in an overhead press.
[116:46.72]Right on his face.
[116:47.39]Pancakes him into the ground.
[116:50.53]Another contestant should be coming out here very shortly as he really works on those cords.
[116:55.49]BDDBB is, you know, he was told backstage.
[116:59.15]And there's no countdown on the screen.
[117:01.27]But that's okay because here comes another contestant.
[117:04.27]And it is... The Yenilander!
[117:07.53]One of the only old school from last year.
[117:10.13]The Anor Lander making his second appearance in a Jerma wrestling appearance.
[117:15.01]No, they're gonna get rid of Bootleg Duck Dynasty B.I.
[117:18.11]Batman.
[117:18.45]This could be the end.
[117:19.93]He could be going over right now.
[117:22.31]And the first elimination.
[117:23.53]Is he the first?
[117:24.09]He is the first.
[117:24.89]No, he's not.
[117:26.41]I spoke way too soon there.
[117:27.81]Almost the first elimination of the Rumble was BDDBB.
[117:31.80]Anilander, welcome back as the third contestant.
[117:35.36]No countdown, though, unfortunately, so we're just gonna have to hear the buzzer, and that's when we know a new person's coming in.
[117:41.86]They come in every 30 to 60 seconds, something like that.
[117:44.05]I don't know.
[117:44.75]Who knows?
[117:45.59]You'll see.
[117:47.25]Just like that, here comes another person the fourth contestant is gonna be.
[117:51.67]As Anilander is on the backstage there.
[117:54.31]Who's that?
[117:54.67]Oh, wait a minute!
[117:57.01]I think I know who that is!
[117:58.76]That's Louie Anderson!
[118:00.24]From Family Feud!
[118:02.16]Louie Anderson from Family Feud makes his Rumble debut!
[118:05.98]He's got a really fucked up face.
[118:08.56]I didn't even see him from the side, but welcome Louie Anderson!
[118:13.20]Wow, that's a dangerous move to go up there, Anilander.
[118:15.26]You don't want to go on the top rope that early.
[118:18.77]Louie Anderson's getting just fucking destroyed.
[118:22.59]His face is like a melted chocolate bar.
[118:27.40]Mixed with clay.
[118:31.04]He is another one of the representatives of Family Feud.
[118:34.05]As well as the Vumps.
[118:36.11]And we are going to have five people in the ring here.
[118:37.89]Another contestant coming in right now.
[118:40.57]Who do you think it is?
[118:41.70]I don't know.
[118:42.34]It could be... It's Widowmaker!
[118:44.28]From Overwatch!
[118:46.37]She's here to get her redemption from last time.
[118:49.35]Last stream.
[118:50.23]She got instantly eliminated.
[118:52.59]And she's not going to let that happen again.
[118:54.15]Absolutely not.
[118:55.03]No way.
[118:56.23]Will it happen again?
[118:57.67]Will Widowmaker get eliminated again instantly?
[119:02.91]No.
[119:04.02]Widowmaker is in it for less than 12 seconds last time.
[119:09.08]She's in it for more than 12 seconds now.
[119:10.38]She's beat her previous record.
[119:11.82]Widowmaker from Overwatch.
[119:13.28]Welcome back to the Rumble.
[119:15.92]As now the Anor Lander is in deep shit over there.
[119:18.92]First elimination could be the Anor Lander.
[119:20.70]He is!
[119:22.20]The Anor Lander is the first elimination.
[119:24.21]And I think Duck Dynasty, yeah, Batman might be going out too.
[119:27.41]Did he?
[119:28.53]No, Widowmaker is going to get an elimination.
[119:30.95]Oh, how fucking horrible.
[119:31.97]And there's Dr. Roker.
[119:33.89]You can't get eliminated.
[119:35.41]I was going to say, you get eliminated by Widowmaker.
[119:38.42]Why is everyone standing around?
[119:41.06]Dr. Roker making his second appearance.
[119:43.48]As Widowmaker picks up bootleg Duck Dynasty VF hat man, Louis Anderson, PSVR, and Dr. Roker.
[119:50.92]In the ring at the same time.
[119:53.32]Dr. Roker last time was an absolute god.
[119:56.68]He eliminated at least six or seven people himself.
[120:00.44]Let's see if he's trying to get a repeat here.
[120:01.76]He might.
[120:02.10]Remember, he turned heel, though.
[120:03.12]He's a bad guy.
[120:03.90]While Duck Dynasty VF hat man just took a blow to the face and is bleeding heavily.
[120:09.21]You do not want to go up against Dr. Roker.
[120:11.35]A man with a fucking vengeance.
[120:14.63]Reversal there as Widowmaker having trouble figuring out where to go.
[120:19.88]BDDBB on the ropes again.
[120:21.56]Not going to happen again.
[120:23.72]Are we going to see another... Oh, God.
[120:26.44]Dr. Roker with another elimination.
[120:29.44]Dr. Roker has... Holy shit, that would have been insane.
[120:32.45]He almost just threw Widowmaker over the top ropes there.
[120:34.73]Almost a double elimination.
[120:36.73]Here comes another contestant as DrRoker eliminates BDDBB.
[120:40.11]Sorry, those of you guys that were rooting for BDDBB.
[120:43.11]And here comes VRGuy.
[120:45.45]As his friend over there, his actual console is in the ring still.
[120:51.21]Second contestant, PSVR is still in the ring.
[120:54.60]Usually you don't see that.
[120:55.90]Usually the second person will be gone.
[120:57.10]And the cables are causing a lot of glitching problems, by the way.
[121:00.96]They're going into everybody.
[121:02.08]They're like freaking out.
[121:02.94]They're clipping into the ring.
[121:05.02]It's not good.
[121:07.39]Now, Louie Anderson is being kicked in the face by PSVR, but Widowmaker is taunting.
[121:14.14]He's taunting the audience.
[121:16.84]Jesus Christ, what the fuck was that?
[121:21.56]Oh, Dr. Roka, please get rid of him.
[121:24.32]Jesus fucking Christ.
[121:27.26]I really thought he was gonna do it.
[121:28.58]It looked like she was gonna get scooped over the top ropes.
[121:30.88]If anyone's gonna do it, it's gonna be Dr. Roka.
[121:33.68]Dr. Roker has, like, these perfect eliminations that he does.
[121:36.19]He has, like, a million super moves.
[121:37.59]What just happened to Louis Anderson?
[121:39.59]Louis Anderson just got time-traveled.
[121:42.45]Here comes another contestant.
[121:44.99]Widowmaker wins.
[121:45.87]Or I'm going to unsub.
[121:47.31]Well, I don't think that's going to happen.
[121:48.75]But here comes Frogman.
[121:50.66]Dermot's Dark Souls 3 character.
[121:53.28]If you didn't know, Dermot beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[121:57.20]He beat all the DLC, too.
[121:58.60]So Frogman is still relevant.
[121:59.94]He beat the DLC, like, a few months ago.
[122:02.72]Frogman will always be relevant.
[122:06.01]I refuse to have anybody tell me that Frogman is not a relative character, or a relevant at all.
[122:11.23]They won't ever tell me that.
[122:16.25]Nice.
[122:17.86]Uh, what's that guy's name that does that move?
[122:19.24]I don't even remember.
[122:21.48]Nice reversal into a bulldog.
[122:23.86]Not a bulldog.
[122:25.66]What's that move?
[122:26.88]What's that thing?
[122:28.02]The VR guy's on the top ropes now.
[122:30.31]Taunting Frogman.
[122:40.42]Okay, he did a somersault hurricanrana and just fucking buried his head into the ground.
[122:47.82]Frogman immediately gets up from that and he's gonna get eliminated after such a fucking beautiful display of athleticism.
[122:53.51]He's gonna get punched in the face and he's gonna be gone.
[122:55.87]After that front flip, that would be so sad if the VR guy would have gone right now.
[122:59.61]No, thankfully he's not.
[123:02.90]The VR guy is slowly becoming one of my favorite characters, by the way, as Dr. Roker is leaning onto Widowmaker's chest here, going for his second elimination, probably.
[123:13.65]At least Widowmaker can say that she held on for at least two to three minutes.
[123:19.05]She's not letting go.
[123:21.24]She's still in.
[123:22.60]But she is going to get punched in the face.
[123:24.60]And Dr. Roker now has...
[123:30.61]Dr. Roker scoopslams Widowmaker out of the ring.
[123:33.39]Widowmaker is eliminated.
[123:35.53]In extravagant fashion.
[123:38.57]Dr. Roker with his second elimination.
[123:41.17]Of the evening.
[123:42.75]Focusing his sights onto Louis Anderson.
[123:46.19]Who is currently fighting with the PSVR.
[123:48.86]I can't wait for the PSVR to get out of the ring.
[123:52.21]The PSVR is just annoying.
[123:54.61]Those cords are starting to really piss me off, because they're like... They're fucking with my brain.
[123:58.60]I keep thinking someone's glitching through the ground.
[124:01.18]That's Frogman now.
[124:01.94]VR guy has Frogman on the left.
[124:04.18]They've been fighting for a long time, going back and forth.
[124:07.06]Still no elimination.
[124:08.12]Another character is going to be coming out here.
[124:10.36]I'm surprised no characters come out right now.
[124:12.05]What's going on backstage?
[124:14.37]Where are the other characters?
[124:16.25]There's like 23 other people that are in this Rumble.
[124:19.61]Where the fuck are they?
[124:21.54]It's just these guys fighting endlessly.
[124:25.13]And there's no countdown.
[124:27.03]It's just people dying in the ring.
[124:30.95]Dr. Roker's Louis Anderson actually may need medical attention.
[124:35.39]No, no, he's okay.
[124:36.71]Look at those stomps from Dr. Roker into the face of the PSVR.
[124:42.92]Where is the next character?
[124:46.04]Did the buzzer go off?
[124:49.52]I think it's just endless.
[124:51.68]Oh, there's the buzzer, finally.
[124:53.10]I'm not sure what that was.
[124:54.06]A little bit of extra time backstage.
[124:56.34]Whoever, I don't know.
[124:57.14]They're taking their sweet-ass time, and of course they are!
[124:59.54]Because that's Dr. Mosquito!
[125:02.37]Jerma's PUBG stream guy.
[125:06.27]And he gets it and immediately goes right for the PSVR.
[125:08.53]He's a PC exclusive.
[125:10.37]Of course he's going to go right for the PSVR and try to kill him.
[125:14.85]Dr. Mosquito.
[125:16.57]The world's most renowned Mosquito Doctor as the VR guy has been dumped out.
[125:20.73]No, he's still in.
[125:24.99]Now, if you just want to know, Dr. Mosquito is not actually a mosquito.
[125:29.55]He's a mosquito doctor.
[125:31.97]And he's about to be eliminated immediately.
[125:33.79]That's so sad.
[125:35.27]Dr. Mosquito.
[125:36.07]No, thank God.
[125:38.58]Thank God we get to see Dr. Mosquito for longer.
[125:42.55]This Jerma PUBG character, he has to stay in.
[125:45.04]Dr. Oetker just overhead military pressed Louis Anderson out of the ring.
[125:51.12]Louis Anderson is gone.
[125:52.28]That's the third elimination from Dr. Oetker.
[125:58.32]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[126:01.18]Dr. Oetker is on a rampage again.
[126:05.12]Look, he's on such a rampage, he just fucking vacuum cleaned Dr. Mosquito into his hands.
[126:12.76]Dr. Roker is going to go all the way.
[126:15.52]You better believe it.
[126:16.91]He has not even an ounce of stamina has been lost.
[126:20.21]The VR guy and Frogman have been fighting this whole time.
[126:24.39]There's been no leeway given between each of the characters.
[126:26.93]They've just been a never-ending fight.
[126:30.52]And to the point where there's not much to say.
[126:34.66]I'm going to throw you over the ropes and put my foot on your chest.
[126:37.50]And then I'm going to put you over the ropes and put my foot on your chest.
[126:40.18]Oh, is it my turn to do that yet?
[126:42.78]As the PSVR is being turned around by Dr. Ocher.
[126:46.82]No way.
[126:48.21]No way.
[126:49.31]Somebody has to deal with Dr. Ocher.
[126:50.81]Because that's another elimination coming up here.
[126:55.25]Dr. Mosquito.
[126:56.67]A fellow doctor.
[126:58.63]Of course he's not going to interrupt this.
[127:00.63]He also has his MD.
[127:02.35]Why would he try to prevent this?
[127:04.55]PSVR just barely holds on.
[127:07.15]And here comes James Garfield.
[127:11.08]One of the many Garfields that you've seen tonight.
[127:13.72]James Garfield in the ring in the Rumble for the first time.
[127:16.76]There has to be a president in every Rumble.
[127:19.04]That's just the way it is.
[127:20.74]It'll never change.
[127:22.78]Even if I do more than 45, 46, 47 of these, I'll make up a fucking president.
[127:29.66]I'll just make a person up.
[127:31.75]Oh, by the way, if you take a look to the right, Frogman is currently getting his face, his chest stomped on by the VR guy.
[127:37.95]They're going to do this forever.
[127:40.71]Neither one of them is going to get eliminated.
[127:41.89]They're going to continue to do this until the final two.
[127:44.64]That's my prediction.
[127:46.58]Dr. Roker just eliminated another person.
[127:49.28]I can't believe it.
[127:50.50]PSVR is gone.
[127:51.50]Dr. Roker with another elimination.
[127:55.16]And I spoke too soon.
[127:56.02]VR guy is out.
[127:57.74]Frogman with a big right hand.
[128:01.46]Brings it down to four.
[128:04.88]Unfortunate.
[128:05.38]PSVR could have been a pretty big scene.
[128:07.56]Scene.
[128:08.18]Seed.
[128:08.56]Jerma's had a couple of drinks.
[128:12.17]He's having trouble talking.
[128:15.19]As James... If I say James Comey again.
[128:19.43]I swear to God.
[128:21.01]Frogman on the top ropes.
[128:22.87]You don't taunt Dr. Oaker.
[128:24.73]Do not get on those top ropes and taunt.
[128:26.47]That's a big mistake.
[128:27.41]But it still worked out for him.
[128:29.97]Doesn't look good.
[128:33.00]Oetker has lost a little steam in the next five minutes or so, I think.
[128:37.08]No, right when I said that he's good, buzzer's going to happen any second here, and we're going to get our next contestant.
[128:45.44]Don't do it.
[128:46.88]Don't do it.
[128:47.46]Don't do another one.
[128:48.72]Don't do the same exact thing you did last time, and then get eliminated.
[128:53.96]Everybody's rooting for Dr. Oetker now.
[128:55.72]Like, they are.
[128:56.67]I am.
[128:57.05]Of course I am.
[129:00.49]Here comes a fifth person into the ring.
[129:02.59]I believe this is number... Holy shit, James Comfey.
[129:06.23]Here comes Charlie Cheesnips.
[129:10.00]One of the shit characters.
[129:12.56]Uh, lost to Captain Cheez-It earlier this afternoon.
[129:16.42]This evening, whatever time it is right now, in your local standard time.
[129:22.28]He's gonna come and he's gonna eliminate James Comfey.
[129:25.36]Yes, he is.
[129:26.62]Charlie Chee- Don't get eliminated by Charlie Cheesnips.
[129:31.79]Because Dr. Mosquito is playing very passively.
[129:37.28]Which, believe it or not, is the right play.
[129:40.74]He's going for a kidney punch right in the back of his sternum.
[129:45.18]Going for an elimination?
[129:46.74]Oh, yeah, he's trying to get rid of James Garfield.
[129:49.68]Charlie Cheesnips is on it again.
[129:51.71]On the clock.
[129:53.55]There's Wirehead Ned.
[129:55.91]Six people in the ring.
[129:56.67]Wirehead Ned is...
[130:00.52]That little shoulder throw by Dr. Okra.
[130:02.82]Wirehead Ned.
[130:04.58]Going right for Dr. Mosquito.
[130:08.04]Hopefully we see.
[130:08.70]I want Wirehead Ned to do well.
[130:12.48]Both hands on Dr. Mosquito's neck.
[130:15.17]Choking him.
[130:16.85]Drop kicks him.
[130:17.75]He's gone.
[130:18.43]Dr. Mosquito is out.
[130:19.53]Thank you for participating, Dr. Mosquito.
[130:22.87]Please return to your research.
[130:24.13]No!
[130:24.57]No!
[130:26.06]Dr. Roker.
[130:26.74]Both doctors have been eliminated at the same time.
[130:29.70]Dr. Roker and Dr. Mosquito.
[130:33.10]Both gone.
[130:35.78]Just like that.
[130:37.48]Dr. Roker is gone.
[130:40.66]Say goodbye.
[130:42.48]By Frogman, nonetheless.
[130:44.18]Frogman has done a lot of work here.
[130:47.08]That's the second or third elimination from Frogman.
[130:51.03]Wirehead Ned just barely holds on to the ropes and curls back around them.
[130:57.25]Everyone's freaking out.
[131:00.01]Nice Jerma suplex there, or belly-to-back suplex by Ned Wirehead.
[131:05.97]And... Just kind of like a boxing match over in the corner there.
[131:11.36]Resting.
[131:12.36]There goes Frogman.
[131:14.08]Dropkick by James Garfield.
[131:17.14]All these top seeds are being eliminated.
[131:20.48]All you got now is you got two humans and Charlie Cheesnips.
[131:24.00]Well, this turned out to be fucking awful.
[131:27.15]I don't know who did the move there.
[131:28.45]I couldn't tell.
[131:30.51]James Garfield did a pretty good job there.
[131:32.45]I'm assuming that's who did that move.
[131:34.95]And here comes another contestant coming in right now.
[131:38.11]Who is it?
[131:40.30]It's Earl Vump.
[131:41.78]From the Vumps.
[131:43.86]I had high hopes for these guys.
[131:46.50]The Vumps.
[131:47.76]Yeah, like, come on.
[131:49.54]They have, like, good stats.
[131:51.36]He just prayed.
[131:53.50]James Garfield just said a prayer and just saluted.
[131:55.83]He did, like, a fucking USA salute and landed on it.
[131:59.89]Uh, the bumps are really disappointing.
[132:03.49]I was under the impression that... I thought they were gonna do well.
[132:06.83]He's doing push-ups on his back.
[132:10.38]What a fucking real man's man.
[132:12.82]James Garfield just turned into the new Dr. Okra, I think.
[132:17.12]Don't be surprised.
[132:19.77]Doesn't even care.
[132:20.29]He won't even look at him.
[132:21.90]Next contestant coming in right now.
[132:24.66]Turned his back on Earl Vump for some reason.
[132:28.10]And there's Mr. Sneak Man.
[132:30.36]You can't have a rumble without fucking Mr. Sneak Man.
[132:32.70]Of course he's going to make an appearance.
[132:34.97]One of the many veterans that instantly is coming in to eliminate Earl Vump.
[132:41.07]There he goes.
[132:41.73]Nope.
[132:42.37]Earl Vump stays on it, Mr. Sneak Man.
[132:44.31]Welcome back for the, I believe, the fourth time or third time in a rumble.
[132:50.13]Thank you so much for joining us again, Mr. Schneider.
[132:53.55]Now Charlie Cheesnips.
[132:55.19]And Ned Wirehead in the corner.
[132:57.51]On the side.
[132:59.47]This is a dangerous move.
[133:00.53]He's telling James Comey to pick him up.
[133:03.07]No, he didn't.
[133:05.35]Drop kick.
[133:06.01]Oh, God.
[133:07.63]No, there goes Wirehead, Ned.
[133:09.19]Charlie Cheesnips with the drop kick.
[133:10.93]Drop kick.
[133:12.45]Over the top rope.
[133:14.59]And James.
[133:15.47]I said it again.
[133:16.01]I know.
[133:16.93]Whatever.
[133:17.57]Who fucking cares?
[133:19.05]There's Rodney Bump.
[133:21.39]Two members of the Vump family are in the ring.
[133:24.79]There's only one more.
[133:27.77]Peggy Vump is the only Vump that remains.
[133:30.83]So hopefully they will work together here.
[133:32.37]And not... And not go against each other.
[133:37.73]And Charlie Cheeseneff just did his finishing move.
[133:41.11]To Rodney Vump.
[133:45.46]Now he's just staring at him.
[133:47.78]Showing him the elbow, dropping it on his face.
[133:50.94]In true celebrated fashion.
[133:52.20]We're doing it again.
[133:53.67]Second time for Rodney Vaughn.
[133:54.91]Mr. Sneak Man going over the top.
[133:55.91]No!
[133:57.23]He's going to pull up the same generic I don't get eliminated.
[134:00.45]Look, did you see those feet kicking by James Garfield?
[134:04.70]That was just like a, no, I don't want to go to bed.
[134:06.16]I don't want to take a bath.
[134:08.04]That was fucking awesome.
[134:10.58]I don't think Mr. Sneakman is going to get eliminated.
[134:12.20]I really don't.
[134:13.14]Especially not by Earl Vump.
[134:15.46]Rod D. Vump is already done.
[134:19.56]He's probably going to get eliminated right now.
[134:22.73]And fill up the ring with six.
[134:23.83]Here comes another contestant.
[134:27.29]Why does this person have music?
[134:29.89]That was Glue Man.
[134:30.73]Why does Glue... Why did Glue Man have a guitar riff for one second?
[134:35.17]I don't know.
[134:36.77]Welcome, Glue Man.
[134:37.47]Welcome back.
[134:39.48]You've been in almost every single Rumble, of course you're gonna be in this one.
[134:42.84]You and Mr. Sneak Man, veterans, that deserve to be here.
[134:46.84]You're the only one that gets a guitar riff.
[134:49.71]And James Garfield, and there goes Ratifah!
[134:53.99]And potentially Glue Man as well.
[134:56.73]Glue Man is being pushed so hardly.
[135:00.33]Hardly.
[135:01.93]We gotta work on our vocabulary words after the stream ends.
[135:05.49]As James Garfield's now got Glue Man on the ropes.
[135:08.63]Blue Man, the only one of these characters... Well, there's actually one more that has an emote.
[135:13.29]He is an emote character, so you know that he... Of course he's gonna be... He's already bleeding, by the way.
[135:20.71]Garfield already has him bloody.
[135:23.13]Or are those just face bruises?
[135:24.51]I really don't know.
[135:25.87]He is still technically a human.
[135:27.56]And he hasn't done anything.
[135:29.76]He hasn't done shit.
[135:30.34]He's just come in and gotten pushed a few times.
[135:33.02]Finally going to get a reversal onto Garfield.
[135:35.38]Hopefully they can get rid of Garfield.
[135:36.60]Because he wasn't supposed to be any good.
[135:38.44]He was supposed to just be a random president that's in every single one of these.
[135:41.34]So hopefully Glue Man takes him.
[135:42.44]Yeah, thank God.
[135:44.26]Punch right in the face.
[135:45.20]Garfield is gone.
[135:46.32]Glue Man in the ring.
[135:48.90]I don't hate these right now.
[135:50.82]I'm okay with these four.
[135:52.68]Mr. Sneakman, Glue Man, Cheesnips, and Earl Vump.
[135:56.84]All good contenders.
[135:58.96]Jumping off the top rope, Hurricane Rana.
[136:02.67]Showboating like he always does.
[136:04.11]Blue Man.
[136:06.71]Don't, don't, don't let Charlie Cheesnips eliminate you after that.
[136:10.02]Not after that.
[136:10.64]Here comes another contestant.
[136:12.56]And there's Peggy Vump.
[136:14.24]Peggy Vump.
[136:14.92]All the bumps are now accounted for.
[136:17.08]All of Family Feud has been accounted for.
[136:20.74]Louis Anderson, if you remember.
[136:23.19]What the fuck?
[136:24.91]Chunk.
[136:26.87]Charlie Cheesnips just dropped Glue Man out of the ring.
[136:30.33]Charlie Cheesnips with another elimination to Glue Man.
[136:32.89]Can Glue Man ever stay in the ring for more than fucking one minute?
[136:37.66]And Peggy Bump now ends in trouble.
[136:40.52]Nope.
[136:43.30]God damn it.
[136:45.96]I fucking love Glue Man.
[136:47.20]He's never going to do anything.
[136:49.52]He got to the final three one time.
[136:53.34]And it'll never happen again.
[136:57.25]Going for the grab there.
[136:58.09]Trying to throw Peggy Bump over the top ropes.
[137:00.59]In comes another contestant.
[137:01.83]We're getting to the final half here, I believe.
[137:03.51]The last probably 10 characters.
[137:04.61]The last 15 characters.
[137:05.55]Who's it going to be?
[137:07.49]It's Jerma.
[137:08.81]Jerma985.
[137:10.87]The owner of this channel.
[137:15.09]Hopefully he wins.
[137:17.73]Because it's me.
[137:19.11]And of course I'd like to see myself win.
[137:20.59]Just got burnt.
[137:21.21]I just burnt my hand on Mr. Sneakman's back.
[137:26.20]I have the same outfit on as Earl Vump, but I don't have a tie and I'm unbuttoned.
[137:31.78]Let's go.
[137:32.10]Let's double team.
[137:32.98]Come on, Vump.
[137:34.52]Jerma and Vump can double team Mr. Snakeman right now and get him up.
[137:36.76]But that's going to be sad if that does happen.
[137:38.86]It's not going to happen.
[137:39.98]Peggy Vump on the receiving end of Charlie Cheesnips.
[137:44.03]Who could get his third elimination here.
[137:47.89]Maybe.
[137:48.89]Ring's going to be real full in a second.
[137:51.53]Booze coming out now.
[137:52.67]I wonder who it is.
[137:55.32]Oh, that's jermaMoon.
[137:56.54]That's jermaMoon.
[137:57.70]Why are people booing jermaMoon?
[138:02.45]Like, I thought everybody loved jermaMoon.
[138:04.21]Like, why would you fucking boo him?
[138:06.99]And now it's, oh, here we go.
[138:07.99]It's creator versus creation.
[138:11.15]jermaMoon versus, it's Frankenstein versus Frankenstein's monster.
[138:17.63]Who's going to win this never-ending battle?
[138:19.87]His first emote.
[138:20.83]Jerma's first ever emote.
[138:25.12]He's gonna get eliminated.
[138:25.82]I'm gonna get eliminated by my own emote.
[138:29.62]No.
[138:32.18]It's gonna happen.
[138:33.94]Again, I'm another one of those fucking people that comes in and gets eliminated immediately.
[138:38.05]It happens every time.
[138:41.33]Well, EarlVump and MrSneakMan... EarlVump is resting.
[138:46.27]He was like out of breath.
[138:50.18]They're not booing, they are mooing.
[138:51.78]PeggyVump just got on the top ropes real quick.
[138:56.33]Someone's gonna make that move and it's gonna be a dangerous thing and they're gonna get dropped.
[139:00.28]Just like Charlie Cheesnip's got dropped right there.
[139:03.64]This is the mountain from Game of Thrones.
[139:07.92]It really is.
[139:09.46]It's just the mountain from Game of Thrones with a jermaMoon t-shirt on and a bag on his head.
[139:17.57]Mr. Sneak Man is in trouble.
[139:18.85]Earl Vump on the ropes!
[139:22.87]Same thing with Peggy Vump over there on the right side.
[139:27.06]Big knee drop there from jermaMoon to Jerma.
[139:31.63]We're going to see another person coming up.
[139:33.53]I think very shortly the buzzer's going to ring.
[139:36.31]There goes Mr. Sneakman.
[139:37.41]Big dropkick by Earl Bump.
[139:40.46]A lot of people were rooting for you, Mr. Sneakman.
[139:42.20]Sorry, you are out.
[139:44.06]You are gone.
[139:45.80]Two bumps still remain.
[139:49.83]And jermaMoon is so big that he tried to grab two people at the same time.
[139:55.58]Snapsuplex, Jerma gets for his trouble, and finally, Charlie Cheese Nips is gone.
[140:01.04]Charlie Cheese Nips.
[140:03.04]Thank goodness that fucking Captain Cheez-It is still available.
[140:07.04]I hope he's the last character.
[140:08.58]I hope Charlie... Okay, Peggy Bump has, like, the strength of Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[140:16.57]jermaMoon is like at least 400 or 500 pounds.
[140:18.77]That was insane.
[140:23.59]We could have a bad bump situation here.
[140:28.68]If these bumps are not taken care of, see you later.
[140:31.42]Nope.
[140:32.14]Almost.
[140:33.12]Jerma tried to just throw Earl of Bumps' legs over the ropes, but Earl of Bumps grabbed on and stayed with it.
[140:39.86]We get the two Jermas versus the two Vumps.
[140:43.10]And a equalizer is going to come in the ring here.
[140:46.26]And we're in the last, I think the last 10 or so.
[140:49.74]And there's the gorilla reading a book from the movies.
[140:54.10]The first of the movies' representatives.
[140:57.38]Who had a very, very beautiful display earlier.
[141:00.22]Just decimating the Vumps.
[141:01.74]And the vendetta is still there, as you can see.
[141:03.84]Peggy Vump has been eliminated by jermaMoon.
[141:06.54]And we're about to see Earl Vump suffer the same fate here.
[141:10.69]Courtesy of Jerma and the Gorilla Breeding Book.
[141:13.25]There he goes.
[141:13.71]There goes all the bumps.
[141:15.85]Every bump has now been eliminated and accounted for.
[141:20.00]Family feud is now done.
[141:21.66]While jermaMoon is just picking Jerma up by his waist.
[141:26.44]And just throwing him.
[141:28.18]That was strength if I've ever seen it.
[141:30.70]While the Gorilla Breeding Book is now just gonna chill on the ropes.
[141:34.85]And jermaMoon is... What the fuck is jermaMoon doing?
[141:38.57]Hahaha.
[141:41.97]And ladies and gentlemen, making his debut here, that's Etalyx.
[141:46.66]Etalyx making his second appearance.
[141:48.92]His first appearance was as Danny DeVito.
[141:51.52]But now the real Etalyx is in the ring.
[141:54.57]Welcome Etalyx to the Jerma Rumble.
[141:59.35]Looks just like him, don't it?
[142:01.49]Pretty good fucking Etalyx, if you don't say so myself.
[142:05.48]So Jerma, Etalyx, and jermaMoon in the ring at the same time.
[142:09.64]And Jerma and Etalyx are friends.
[142:11.80]It's not that they're like enemies.
[142:12.92]It's not like they're not friends or anything.
[142:15.36]I wonder if Etalyx is in the chat.
[142:18.96]Could be.
[142:20.36]It's possible.
[142:22.93]And a fifth person coming in as Etalyx gets a right hand smashed down to the back of the skull.
[142:29.29]Two very big...
[142:31.52]Oh, and there's my favorite character.
[142:34.16]Andrew Jackary Jacked.
[142:36.40]You thought he was going to be in one wrestling video.
[142:38.40]You thought he was going to be in one stream.
[142:40.40]Nope.
[142:41.58]That's the fucking best character.
[142:43.30]And he has a good chance of winning.
[142:46.40]Andrew Jackary Jacked.
[142:48.40]Making his second fucking appearance.
[142:50.82]I'm so happy to see this.
[142:52.82]jermaMoon is ruining the ropes.
[142:55.26]I don't know what just happened, but I thought it was cool.
[142:57.69]Andrew Jackary Jacked.
[143:00.11]Just did a choke slip.
[143:01.86]Did Jerma just took off a turnbuckle?
[143:05.14]Jerma just took a turnbuckle off the side.
[143:08.98]That's dangerous.
[143:10.54]That is really dangerous.
[143:13.37]Here comes another competitor.
[143:15.99]Who could this be?
[143:16.67]Oh my god!
[143:21.36]That's from Until Dawn!
[143:22.89]That's the syringe clown!
[143:25.01]And the syringe clown is like... Wait, what?
[143:36.82]What the fuck was that?
[143:38.82]That was the first...
[143:46.03]That was the fastest elimination ever.
[143:48.44]That was faster than Widowmaker.
[143:49.92]And what was I doing on the top ropes?
[143:52.76]I was lying down on the top ropes for no reason.
[143:55.84]I took off the turnbuckle.
[143:57.96]Why am I on, like, fucking crack right now?
[144:00.82]Anyways, Jerma with the sweet chin music!
[144:03.38]Eliminates the book gorilla over the top ropes.
[144:05.50]Jerma is a top seed this time.
[144:07.99]He may have gained some weight, but he also gained some fucking abilities too, apparently.
[144:11.87]One of those is Garfield lying down on the turnbuckle.
[144:15.57]And the jermaMoon is now going to get dumped over.
[144:17.37]Etalyx and Jerma both respectively could eliminate.
[144:22.24]No, just barely.
[144:23.32]And there goes jermaMoon.
[144:25.98]Master conquers creation.
[144:29.28]And now we have Jerma, Etalyx, and Andrew Jack can reject.
[144:34.98]We have to be getting... No, don't sleep on the turnbuckle again.
[144:37.80]No!
[144:49.70]No!
[144:50.46]God damn it.
[144:56.43]Oh, come on.
[144:58.27]Why?
[144:59.79]Why does this game suck such asshole?
[145:13.60]Fucking WWE 2K17 fucking sucks.
[145:20.44]Come on.
[145:26.81]Alright, hold on.
[145:30.85]Give me a fucking break.
[145:36.23]My fat fucking ass dropped into the middle and it broke the game.
[145:41.36]Ugh.
[145:43.41]I did an elbow drop off the top rope and I fucking shattered the console my fucking 600 pound body Give me a fucking break.
[145:55.61]I'm so salty right now.
[145:56.93]I'm so angry
[146:13.40]God damn it again.
[146:14.94]It happened again Hold on my yeah Who let me see who is left well, let's let's do it right this time I
[146:39.27]Let me open it up and see how many people were left and we'll do one with those people.
[146:45.21]I think there really was 10 people left.
[146:50.93]That's such a pain in the ass.
[146:52.71]I can't believe it.
[146:54.43]I can't believe doing a fucking elbow drop off the top broke the goddamn game.
[147:01.00]Just redo it?
[147:02.06]Just redo the whole thing?
[147:03.00]Alright, fine.
[147:05.54]Do the whole thing.
[147:06.20]Okay.
[147:06.36]Okay.
[147:11.31]It's so fucking frustrating.
[147:15.39]Alright, while we have a second, I'm going to read some bits while I set it back up again.
[147:21.31]Edgemont, thank you for the $4.
[147:24.78]What is going on here?
[147:27.54]Thank you, Edge... Wait, why are we doing the triple threat match again?
[147:32.54]Oh, look at this.
[147:33.04]It doesn't know where... The game fucked up and it doesn't even know where we are.
[147:39.01]I'm going to skip this.
[147:40.41]This is going to take a minute or two.
[147:44.23]That's so fucking... Just watch the clown win.
[147:47.11]Dude, that was perfect too.
[147:48.55]He got so fucked.
[147:51.30]I couldn't even say his name right and he was gone.
[147:53.30]I was sleeping on the turnbuckle.
[147:56.76]I pulled the turnbuckle off.
[147:57.78]There was so much potential for that.
[148:01.60]The timeline fucking splits again.
[148:07.69]Grandma's back from the dead.
[148:10.77]No, we're gonna skip this.
[148:13.03]I'm actually just gonna exit out and just do a Royal Rumble.
[148:16.04]Just put all the people that were in it.
[148:17.56]That's probably the best bet.
[148:24.30]I took off the... That's so annoying.
[148:29.00]And before second crash.
[148:32.57]There is like a couple of characters that you haven't seen yet that they would have had perfect fucking entrances there.
[148:39.51]Oh, that's so annoying.
[148:47.26]And look at this loading screen.
[148:53.82]Okay, who is in the ring?
[148:57.34]We'll clean that one up.
[149:00.33]We'll do like an edit.
[149:01.75]Just like pretend it didn't happen.
[149:10.27]We can do a full redo after if you want to.
[149:13.60]It was like, it was like, there was like fucking four people that would come.
[149:16.02]Oh, that's, oh, I'm so fucking irritated.
[149:18.58]It was me, Etalyx, and Jack Harry Jacks.
[149:27.48]Look at this shit.
[149:34.74]Alright, let me, like, get out of this.
[149:38.64]Sorry for the technical difficulties.
[149:42.83]But, uh... Yeah, pretty much game sucks.
[149:47.47]Is all you need to say.
[149:49.97]Okay, quit match.
[149:56.30]Why did I play this on PC?
[149:57.36]Because it was not available for PC at launch.
[150:03.64]It never is.
[150:07.19]Alright.
[150:08.59]Let me go back here.
[150:10.85]Let's clean that one up because I... Use a better WWE game.
[150:18.44]I would love to use 2K14, but it's always been like a hassle capturing it.
[150:24.36]I have a fucking million characters on 2K14.
[150:26.74]I mean, we kind of just... We have to just do it again.
[150:32.03]It's not going to be the same.
[150:35.05]Let me just set it up.
[150:39.51]Go back in time and prevent the crash.
[150:41.43]I would fucking love to.
[150:42.55]Okay, who the fuck is this?
[150:57.35]We're just gonna do it again.
[150:59.11]There's actually quite a few characters that you didn't see.
[151:01.85]Hmm.
[151:08.07]No, for the sake of that one, okay, for the sake of that one, we are gonna do 10.
[151:11.87]We're gonna do 10, man.
[151:16.33]We'll close the stream by doing one more redo.
[151:18.97]But like, that was too perfect.
[151:21.51]No!
[151:21.99]God damn it.
[151:23.19]Oh, fuck this game.
[151:24.59]Fuck this goddamn game.
[151:27.33]Oh my god.
[151:31.66]Ugh.
[151:32.32]2K, could you make a worse fucking video game?
[151:34.28]Holy shit.
[151:37.70]That was a $50 criticism of your stream.
[151:43.36]Oh, God.
[151:49.34]I'm glad we get working products from 2K.
[151:55.41]It's fucking like... It was just like, Shawn Michaels is in this.
[152:04.24]I have a list of the eliminations if you're doing 10.
[152:06.94]I think I know who was and wasn't in it.
[152:09.72]I remember, like, who you haven't seen.
[152:18.20]No moment in a redo can be as great as Syringe Clown.
[152:21.42]Alright, 10-man rumble.
[152:25.44]Change the fucking participants.
[152:29.90]Okay.
[152:31.70]I know who was left.
[152:39.05]He was gone.
[152:39.77]He was gone.
[152:44.19]He's not in it, so he's not going to be in it.
[152:51.22]We didn't see him.
[152:52.28]Very important.
[152:58.20]We didn't see him either.
[152:59.18]This is so fucking unfortunate.
[153:03.35]This is not going to be the same.
[153:07.23]This is not going to be the same.
[153:12.19]What a fucking buzzkill.
[153:18.92]We're just going to have to redo the whole thing.
[153:20.94]It's not going to be the same.
[153:21.76]It's going to be bad.
[153:31.22]We have to do a full redo.
[153:33.90]We have to.
[153:34.94]It's just not going to be the same.
[153:36.72]So...
[153:38.43]I'm going to mute the mic.
[153:40.49]I'm going to get this set up as fast as I can.
[153:42.01]Go take a piss.
[153:42.69]I'll be right back.
[154:46.23]Alright, let's hold on let's try it again It's loading Jerma was bummed I am bummed We were so close till we were so close to this like to like the best fucking characters I
[155:13.99]And they were going to have such a great introduction.
[155:19.34]But no.
[155:19.82]Visual Concepts is a terrible fucking studio.
[155:23.96]That's just the way it is.
[155:29.16]Unfortunately.
[155:29.98]For all of us.
[155:35.25]Glue Man's going to win now.
[155:47.44]Jeremy got bumped what an angry streamer.
[155:50.62]I'm just speaking truth How do we fucking pull thq out of the grave?
[156:01.84]So what God if I'm in the ring, and I fucking do like a fucking elbow drop in the game breaks Alright, it's if this is a full redo, and I'm sorry.
[156:11.68]I'm really really sorry that happened it happened again.
[156:14.00]I
[156:16.31]That was going so fucking well, too.
[156:20.06]But, uh... Hey, Kim, if you're watching right now, Kim, can you bring me down a... Bring me down a beer.
[156:25.76]I need it right now.
[156:27.60]I need to fucking drink.
[156:35.70]Get my own Netflix series.
[156:37.08]That would be fun.
[156:40.54]Okay, here we go.
[156:41.54]Hopefully it doesn't fucking crash again.
[156:45.16]Otherwise, I will be very sad.
[156:46.60]Here we go.
[156:47.16]Who's the first two?
[156:47.88]And watch the first two be like somebody cool.
[156:53.43]Again, I apologize for this.
[156:56.79]Nothing I can do about it, though.
[156:58.57]Hopefully, I mean, it was fucking funny while it lasted.
[157:00.97]Let's just skip this part.
[157:03.25]See what the first contestant is this time.
[157:09.38]Your first contestant.
[157:13.47]is Widowmaker.
[157:15.45]Good.
[157:15.73]That means that she can instantly get fucking eliminated.
[157:18.61]Fucking syringe clown.
[157:20.67]Ay-yi-yi.
[157:21.63]That was perfect.
[157:25.49]Okay, we know Widowmaker.
[157:27.29]We can skip Widowmaker's entrance.
[157:28.57]That's fine.
[157:29.75]Yeah.
[157:32.35]Thanks a lot.
[157:34.59]You watching in real time?
[157:35.71]Like the crash of the centric?
[157:38.28]Oh, I watched it.
[157:38.90]It was really good.
[157:42.79]At least it was funny.
[157:45.35]Thank you.
[157:45.83]Oh, look.
[157:46.39]Here comes the Anilander.
[157:48.17]We know the Anilander.
[157:49.37]Let's go.
[157:56.15]Hey, now we're on screen.
[158:03.75]I got it.
[158:04.17]I got it.
[158:04.49]I got it.
[158:04.79]Don't worry.
[158:05.20]We're good.
[158:06.30]I got it.
[158:09.76]I was like skipping all the shit and talking shit.
[158:12.33]We're good, right at the... Everyone's fine.
[158:14.77]We're good.
[158:15.05]Welcome to... Hey, everybody.
[158:16.37]Welcome to Jerma Wrestling.
[158:17.75]Jerma Rumble livestream 2017 as Widowmaker's just getting a massage from the Anilander.
[158:24.89]She punches him in the face twice.
[158:26.92]Scoops him up.
[158:27.38]Hey, if you're just joining us, yeah, great.
[158:29.68]The game crashed.
[158:32.74]My elbow dropped off the top.
[158:39.12]Anilander's already gone.
[158:40.44]We already did this shit.
[158:41.78]Like, I already said the Anilander.
[158:43.24]Like, it's, you know, second time around, it's not the same.
[158:46.11]But it's okay, because here, you know, it's pretty similar.
[158:48.21]Here comes B, D, D, B, B. Here comes Batman, Duck, Dynasty, Bootleg, yeah.
[158:57.03]Please.
[158:57.95]The elimination.
[158:59.28]The first one has to be.
[159:02.62]He's just watching.
[159:03.32]Anilander is just as hell-bent on getting...
[159:08.50]Weird shit.
[159:10.18]Okay, when the weird shit starts happening, that's when the game crashes.
[159:16.11]And that was fucking weird.
[159:17.45]That was some weird shit right there.
[159:19.77]There's no way to explain that.
[159:22.37]That's just when shit goes wrong.
[159:25.69]That's when the game doesn't want to work anymore.
[159:27.79]But anyways, here comes the fourth contestant.
[159:30.87]As the Anilander gets a terrible seed again.
[159:33.35]Louis Anderson making his appearance.
[159:36.39]There's Louis Anderson for the second time.
[159:40.10]That's B-D-D-B-B.
[159:43.54]Batman ducked honesty bootleg beer.
[159:46.10]Or whatever order you'd like to say those in.
[159:48.53]And the lander now goes over.
[159:51.71]No, it does not.
[159:53.59]It does not.
[159:54.73]I keep thinking of the syringe clown getting dropkicked.
[160:00.41]And me... I can't stop thinking about it.
[160:08.38]And the Anilander has Louis Anderson now in a fireman's carry.
[160:13.83]The Anilander almost eliminated himself.
[160:16.73]And right along here, this is number five.
[160:19.66]Welcome, number five.
[160:21.34]It's Glue Man, because he's the only one with fucking four seconds, not even a second of music.
[160:26.91]And into the corner goes... Andrew Jack... Jack Bootleg Batman Duck Goddess DBF.
[160:34.63]Why do I give people these names?
[160:36.35]I don't know.
[160:36.88]Nice pancake press by Louie Anderson.
[160:41.08]Winner maker going over the top ropes.
[160:43.72]Hopefully, Glue Man stays in.
[160:46.22]Everybody wants to see Glue Man win.
[160:49.30]But it never happens.
[160:52.48]Watch this, Glue Man's gonna get eliminated faster than the last time.
[160:55.93]One of the only guys with a fucking emote on this channel.
[160:59.03]Nope.
[161:00.37]He's holding a sign.
[161:01.27]Is the ring pizza?
[161:03.65]Is the ring slices of pizza?
[161:06.59]Oh, Widowmaker in trouble now too.
[161:08.03]No!
[161:08.95]Nobody eliminated.
[161:11.81]There's Dr. Oetker.
[161:14.36]Dr. Oaker making his second attack.
[161:16.54]Somebody just got real badly hurt.
[161:18.18]I think it was Bat... I think it was Batleg Duck... Bratesty Brea.
[161:23.49]B-D-B-B-D!
[161:25.31]Batman Duck Dynasty Bootleg Brea.
[161:27.83]Doing the Vulcan neck pinch.
[161:30.53]Nice double axel onto... Double axel onto Widowmaker's face.
[161:36.73]Oh, Dr. Oaker now.
[161:37.69]I wonder if he can do the same thing that he did last time.
[161:41.17]Which is eliminate like six people.
[161:43.91]Grabbed by the sides of the face.
[161:46.51]The Anilander tosses Blue Man over to the side of the corner.
[161:50.81]Dr. Oaker.
[161:51.47]Oaker the Ogre.
[161:54.13]Some people in the chat are currently calling him.
[162:00.47]I love when they get back behind him and just start doing something weird to their head.
[162:05.20]That was a... No, Gloom Man's going to get eliminated here.
[162:07.88]Gloom Man's going to get pushed out by the Anilander.
[162:10.28]Which I'm... That upsets me, but I'm not okay with it at the same time.
[162:14.32]No.
[162:15.34]No eliminations yet.
[162:17.40]In our second attempt at the Rump.
[162:20.85]No.
[162:21.09]And here comes the Anilander.
[162:21.85]No.
[162:22.07]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[162:22.99]How many times are we going to say no?
[162:24.55]We're going to say no like a thousand more times.
[162:28.35]We're trading.
[162:28.79]No, they're just trading.
[162:30.73]And there's Widowmaker on the top rope.
[162:32.05]So on the second rope.
[162:34.27]Double Axel into nothing.
[162:35.81]She just, like, fucking walked into him.
[162:38.50]She fe- and there you go, first elimination again.
[162:41.10]Was he the first elimination last time?
[162:43.07]BDDBB.
[162:45.17]I think he was.
[162:45.69]He was in the first or second.
[162:47.87]That was the first elimination.
[162:50.05]New person coming into the ring very, very shortly.
[162:53.67]As Dr. Roker is showing his muscles.
[162:56.20]He doesn't really have any.
[162:58.68]You know, I think I have more muscle than Dr. Roker does.
[163:01.02]I'm pretty sure I do.
[163:02.58]If I would take my shirt off and flex immediately in the game, yeah, sure.
[163:05.50]Maybe not.
[163:07.02]In real life.
[163:09.31]I got pretty big spaghetti arms.
[163:10.63]Big enough.
[163:10.99]And Dr. Roker...
[163:12.76]That would have been sad.
[163:14.40]The second time around, Dr. Roper just gets fucking eliminated.
[163:18.37]Immediately.
[163:18.95]Now, Blue Man's now on the outside.
[163:22.15]Louie Anderson.
[163:23.77]To get eliminated by Louie Anderson is like you're cursed for life.
[163:27.37]Don't do it.
[163:28.47]Don't do it.
[163:30.57]No, he didn't do it.
[163:33.78]Put a facecam on.
[163:34.82]Why would I put a fucking facecam on right now?
[163:37.72]No, it'll take away from the action.
[163:40.02]Like, Glue Man standing, staring at Louis Anderson.
[163:43.38]And... The hug that's going on in the corner.
[163:48.31]Widowmaker's not allowed to get one elimination.
[163:50.01]Don't let it happen.
[163:52.33]Here comes another person.
[163:54.03]The chance that you're going to see somebody you haven't seen is actually pretty high.
[163:57.73]No, it's VR guy.
[163:59.81]VR guy is here.
[164:01.07]For the second time.
[164:02.07]Feels good.
[164:05.44]And... Dr. Oka now pushing out Anilander.
[164:08.06]As you can very plainly see.
[164:15.85]Let's face-cam to see your spaghetti arms.
[164:17.52]No.
[164:18.34]Jesus!
[164:22.14]There it is again.
[164:23.52]There's the move that he's done, like fucking... How does he keep... Why does he have that move?
[164:29.08]I've never... I don't think I even gave him these moves.
[164:31.00]And he just somehow magically fucking has these moves.
[164:33.76]I have no idea.
[164:35.15]And there goes another one.
[164:36.15]Widowmaker gone.
[164:37.91]Louis Anderson gone.
[164:39.33]Dr. Okra on a fucking rampage again.
[164:43.22]Oh my god.
[164:44.58]It's like... Seriously.
[164:48.43]Please get in some new people.
[164:50.81]Let's get us back to like a situation where... He's hurt his elbow.
[164:56.47]He has a fucking VR helmet on his head.
[164:58.18]He can't see shit.
[165:02.12]I have no idea what's happening right now.
[165:03.52]Nice underwear though.
[165:06.49]Backflips out of that.
[165:07.59]Glooban now gets... He does two backflips.
[165:10.53]That's just what happens.
[165:12.57]He's flexing again.
[165:13.61]Oh, fine, Dr. Ogre.
[165:14.23]You want to get, like, fucking showed up?
[165:16.13]Maybe after the stream, I'll show you my fucking muscles.
[165:18.35]Good!
[165:19.21]Moonsault onto Glooban.
[165:22.53]Ogre like onion.
[165:27.04]Who's next?
[165:28.06]Give us a new person.
[165:30.00]Now it's Frogman again.
[165:31.50]Frogman's coming in for the second time.
[165:33.50]Hurricane Runner immediately.
[165:35.91]Immediately gets Hurricanrana.
[165:38.18]As Blue Man picks up Dr. Roker.
[165:41.22]I can't believe.
[165:41.90]No new people.
[165:43.08]I'm surprised you guys haven't seen any new people.
[165:45.14]The percentage is so fucking there.
[165:47.22]There's like nine people you guys haven't seen.
[165:49.34]And we still aren't getting to see them.
[165:52.94]After Spree Muscles?
[165:53.82]Yeah.
[165:54.14]We'll see.
[165:57.00]And now Dr. Ochre and Blue Man trading blows.
[166:00.28]Well, Frogman and the VR guy currently exchanging punches as well.
[166:06.59]No one's doing anything particularly interesting while he's going for the shin kicks.
[166:10.13]Playing fucking Mortal Kombat VR.
[166:11.91]I got jokes all day for the VR guy.
[166:14.13]Like, I promise you that.
[166:15.81]I promise you.
[166:16.25]Who's the next person coming in?
[166:18.81]There's Dr. Mosquito.
[166:20.57]Mosquito MD again.
[166:22.68]DDT on to Frogman.
[166:26.63]The VR guy is... It's weird that I want VR guy to win.
[166:31.56]I do.
[166:33.62]I want VR guy to win, like, so bad, but it's just never gonna fucking happen.
[166:39.04]Is Frogman just hanging out on the side?
[166:40.72]Dr. Oak... He almost just flipped.
[166:42.48]No way.
[166:43.62]No fucking way is that even humanly possible.
[166:46.40]There goes Dr. Oaker.
[166:47.92]Dr. Oaker's gone.
[166:48.84]He just, like, backflipped out of his hands and then, like, flipped into... I don't even know.
[166:53.63]That was, like, totally fucking clutch.
[166:56.84]Dr. Elker's gone, sorry guys.
[166:59.22]He just went for a clothesline and punched himself.
[167:04.08]And now Glue Man doing the ever so like the fucking chicken breast move.
[167:07.88]Here comes James Comey again.
[167:11.93]VR guy's still in.
[167:14.61]Good riddance.
[167:16.41]Dr. Elker can never catch a break.
[167:17.71]Are the people in the front row nude?
[167:20.33]I just saw like two people's like naked bodies, that was weird.
[167:25.09]I said Comey again, you're right.
[167:28.46]What does Dr. Mosquito do?
[167:30.22]Oh, he's doing the generic neck wrench.
[167:33.42]Interesting.
[167:34.24]Interesting move.
[167:37.19]Blue Man now on the ropes.
[167:38.99]No.
[167:40.61]No.
[167:41.37]This time, no one seems to be doing much.
[167:43.09]People are just kind of standing around with their hands up their ass.
[167:46.93]You gotta get a big fucking guy in the ring.
[167:49.02]You know what I mean?
[167:49.58]When it gets like this, a huge guy has to get in the ring.
[167:53.20]That's what fucks it all up.
[167:55.50]Blue Man is in trouble.
[167:56.52]Dr. Ochre is gone.
[167:58.04]That's a different doctor.
[167:58.90]That's Dr. Mosquito.
[167:59.88]In comes another contestant.
[168:00.86]Hopefully it's a huge guy.
[168:01.90]It's Charlie Cheesnips.
[168:05.49]Charlie Cheesnips going right into it.
[168:07.91]No, throw him the other way.
[168:09.37]Throw him the other way.
[168:10.61]Don't throw him into the ring, Charlie.
[168:12.19]Throw him on the other side.
[168:13.69]And now you've got two people in your hands.
[168:18.45]Charlie Cheesnips did very well last time.
[168:23.44]Hopefully he does not do as well this time.
[168:27.15]Cheese Snips.
[168:27.75]Fuck yeah, Cheese Snips is back.
[168:31.73]And a huge dropkick eliminates the VR guy.
[168:37.71]Just, like, roll the dice if the VR guy will ever do anything interesting.
[168:41.13]He's one of my favorite characters, though.
[168:42.75]And there goes James Garfield.
[168:46.13]I almost just said Carfield.
[168:47.21]There goes James Carfield.
[168:49.07]Blue Man has stuck in this now.
[168:52.38]Is the redo going to give Blue Man a chance to get far into the Rumble?
[168:56.06]Maybe.
[168:59.02]Charlie Cheese Nips is the right-hand man of Demon Loads of Raxos.
[169:02.28]No, he's not.
[169:03.76]He's just a shitty character with a shitty food.
[169:07.30]It's not delicious fucking cheese.
[169:09.64]It's gross cheese nips.
[169:10.66]And there he goes in the top rope again.
[169:12.54]Doing the thing that he originally came in.
[169:15.45]Stopping someone.
[169:17.37]He's waiting for Blue Man.
[169:19.97]It actually worked.
[169:22.82]He's been on the top rope a lot of time.
[169:24.82]There goes Frogman.
[169:26.32]Frogman is gone.
[169:27.24]Frogman eliminated.
[169:28.77]Dark Souls 3.
[169:29.25]What?
[169:32.07]Nice, like, disco move, Dr. Mosquito.
[169:34.51]That was fucking stupid.
[169:38.41]Please get Charlie Cheese Nips out of here.
[169:40.45]Like, Frogman, just grab him by the legs and rip him down.
[169:43.79]Bring on the next guy.
[169:46.92]Charlie Cheese Dicks.
[169:48.16]No.
[169:49.54]No, don't get rid of Glue Man.
[169:50.66]Glue Man's gone.
[169:52.00]Charlie Cheesnips and Dr. Mosquito are the only two in the ring.
[169:55.43]What a joke.
[169:56.97]What an absolute fucking travesty this has turned into.
[169:59.29]And he's just choking him.
[170:00.75]Just choking the shit out of him as Ned Wirehead makes his way slowly into the arena.
[170:06.36]I feel like, didn't this happen before?
[170:08.18]I swear to God, these guys were in the ring together last time.
[170:13.56]Maybe not, but a huge clothesline under Wirehead, Ned.
[170:19.04]Punching the air.
[170:20.24]Doing a very good job.
[170:22.36]Practicing.
[170:23.96]With his shadow boxing.
[170:27.20]Cheese eliminated Glue Man.
[170:30.42]No.
[170:31.20]He's just going over the ropes.
[170:33.55]Now he's coming back over.
[170:36.01]The redo was a mistake.
[170:37.89]That means Glue Man.
[170:38.87]Well, Glue Man was eliminated anyway.
[170:40.19]He was gone anyway, so...
[170:42.40]Stream canceled.
[170:43.18]Bring back Blue Man.
[170:45.10]No.
[170:45.59]Stream goes on.
[170:46.89]And incoming in the next opponent.
[170:48.83]Next competitor coming in.
[170:51.03]Is... One of the Vumps is Earl Vump.
[170:54.15]We're almost halfway there now.
[170:56.38]Directly into the hands of Charlie Cheesnips.
[170:59.36]Dr. Mosquito now, he's got, they always do this move where they put the foot down.
[171:04.44]And it's like a 50-50 shot, if they're actually gonna go out or not.
[171:07.62]But Earl Vump immediately takes a finisher.
[171:10.44]Hopefully that will be enough to get rid of the Vumps.
[171:13.80]Just fuck the Vumps.
[171:16.38]I'm gonna be real, he's doing like the let's have sex move.
[171:19.57]No, he punched him right in his mouth.
[171:23.29]He did the, hey, what do you say, like the let's grind at the club dance.
[171:27.21]Not this time.
[171:29.74]He picks him up, wraps him around, throws him over the top ropes.
[171:36.36]Fuck the bump chumps.
[171:39.63]Here we go, Mr. Sneakman's back.
[171:41.11]Here comes Mr. Sneakman, new competitor.
[171:51.32]He picked him up to put him down.
[171:54.82]Censor.
[171:55.18]We're gonna have to censor what I just said right there.
[171:57.93]Let's grind at the club.
[172:00.19]That's his new finisher.
[172:02.01]And there goes Charlie Cheesnips.
[172:05.33]Dr. Mosquito.
[172:08.51]The best mosquito doctor I've ever seen.
[172:12.19]Where is Mr. Sneakman?
[172:13.59]He's right there.
[172:14.21]Sometimes he can be sneaky, but he's on the screen right now.
[172:20.94]Alright, let's go.
[172:22.40]Bring in a new competitor.
[172:25.11]What a backflip into a Sweet Chin Music by Earl Vump and Rodney Vump.
[172:30.01]Rodney Vump is in the ring now.
[172:33.27]Well, Dr. Mosquito is gonna get eliminated by Ned Wirehead, potentially.
[172:38.13]Just a couple of humans in the ring.
[172:39.75]No big deal.
[172:41.17]They're all humans.
[172:44.15]Sometimes... Fuckin' Vumps.
[172:51.47]The Vumps are gonna win now.
[172:52.59]This is what's gonna happen.
[172:53.71]See, we had to redo it.
[172:55.23]Because the game sucks.
[172:57.29]And now the Vumps are gonna win.
[172:59.79]That's God throwing down... That's Zeus throwing a fucking lightning bolt down into my window.
[173:04.86]I'm saying, fuck your stream.
[173:07.28]One of the Vumps is gonna win.
[173:10.50]Dr. Mosquito is human?
[173:11.44]Of course he is.
[173:14.29]He's a mosquito doctor.
[173:15.93]He just, like, plays the part.
[173:16.83]He just dresses up like one.
[173:17.85]Here comes PSVR.
[173:18.33]PSVR.
[173:21.07]The only non-human in the ring.
[173:24.31]Speeding things up a little bit.
[173:25.47]Full ring.
[173:26.84]Mr. Snake Man and Earl Vump.
[173:29.40]Double eliminate these bumps.
[173:31.16]Come on.
[173:32.36]PSVR, do something good for once in your life.
[173:34.00]There it is.
[173:34.86]Mr. Snake Man eliminates Earl Vump with a punch to the face.
[173:39.68]The bumps are the new serpents.
[173:43.00]No, not even close.
[173:45.12]You gotta remember, the serpents... The serpents were seven.
[173:47.73]There were seven serpents.
[173:49.81]There are three Vumps.
[173:52.11]And don't worry.
[173:53.29]The chance that Rodney Vump is going to win is pretty damn low.
[173:58.69]Now he's easing the corner.
[174:00.52]Fucking like a Bronco.
[174:05.58]Ned Wirehead is being shoved over there on the side.
[174:09.58]Is it going to happen?
[174:10.30]Who knows?
[174:12.14]Mr. Sneakman in trouble.
[174:14.61]Game just hung up for a second.
[174:16.27]Better not fucking crash or I'm going to throw it through the window.
[174:22.01]Mr. Snake Man currently in trouble.
[174:24.45]Too in trouble.
[174:26.95]Very much in trouble.
[174:28.79]No.
[174:29.75]He survives to see another day.
[174:32.73]Does he research mosquitoes or cure them?
[174:35.85]He diagnoses and prepares mosquitoes.
[174:42.10]When a mosquito is in trouble or sick.
[174:46.13]They gave they go he gets to see them and he'll like do surgery on the mosquito They'll do like disease research for the mosquitoes This is one of the only mosquito doctors in the world and there you go Peggy bump All the bumps are accounted more.
[175:00.61]They're all in the ring or eliminated Nice knee drop there by Rodney bump That fuck is gonna crash the game if I crash the game again, I swear to God I'm gonna lose it.
[175:11.00]Oh
[175:12.38]Big overhead press on... That's the second time he's done that.
[175:16.85]Dr. Mosquito with another big fireman's carry to Ned Wirehead.
[175:20.37]Over the top ropes.
[175:22.43]You may have just found the new seed to keep your eye on.
[175:26.29]Because that was a big, big finish from Dr. Mosquito.
[175:31.69]Dump the fucking bumps.
[175:34.42]Ned Terry to Dr. Mosquito.
[175:36.64]With another elimination to Mr. Sneakman.
[175:39.96]All to be rewarded by getting eliminated by Peggy Vump.
[175:45.25]What a fucking great redo!
[175:48.27]Thank God.
[175:53.13]Right into a rock bottom.
[175:55.25]Beautiful stuff from Dr. Mosquito.
[175:58.85]Poor Mr. Sneak Man.
[176:01.72]It's alright guys.
[176:02.92]We got two Vumps in here right now.
[176:05.20]Chances are they're gonna get eliminated.
[176:06.46]They're not even that good.
[176:09.08]Nice overhead body slam there by Dr. Mosquito.
[176:13.26]Trying to... Oh God, that is a bad spot for the camera to be.
[176:18.40]Snapping her neck.
[176:20.40]Now the camera is just in a great, great angle.
[176:24.07]Anyways, off the top robes.
[176:25.25]Big splash onto Pecky Vump.
[176:28.47]And the next contestant is Jerma.
[176:31.15]Fat Jerma, get me out of the ring.
[176:33.83]Please eliminate me as fast as possible.
[176:35.49]Get rid of me.
[176:37.28]Come on.
[176:37.76]I can't fucking break the game again.
[176:39.49]Get me out of the ring.
[176:41.43]It's definitely something to do with, like, the fucking real face asset thing.
[176:46.59]And it's on, like, a big fat fucked up body.
[176:48.53]Like, get me out of the ring.
[176:50.69]Please.
[176:52.45]Do whatever it takes to get rid of me.
[176:56.48]I can't be... I can't... Don't crash it.
[176:59.32]You can tell when it's gonna crash when I start, like, ripping turnbuckles off and, like, taking naps.
[177:04.72]There goes Dr. Mosquito by Jerma.
[177:07.31]It's gonna happen.
[177:08.45]Dr. Mosquito is about to be eliminated.
[177:09.83]Here comes another contestant.
[177:12.01]Currently getting booed as Dr. Mosquito goes down.
[177:15.05]There's jermaMoon.
[177:17.51]No, it's all playing out the same.
[177:19.09]The timeline didn't even break.
[177:21.77]We have a slightly different timeline.
[177:24.42]The only difference is there's more bumps in this one.
[177:27.62]I don't know if I like this one.
[177:33.70]Dermamoon eliminates PSVR.
[177:36.62]And Rodney and Peggy Vump... No, no, no!
[177:38.81]Peggy Vump just took a turnbuckle off.
[177:40.87]This is where it gets bad.
[177:42.15]This is where it gets bad.
[177:42.99]Peggy Vump just ripped off a turnbuckle.
[177:47.05]No, no.
[177:50.05]Only this... This is the fucking timeline splitting.
[177:52.51]Only this time, like, Peggy Vump is the psycho.
[177:55.00]She's gonna go sleep on a turnbuckle.
[177:57.22]And then she's gonna crash the game.
[178:02.76]Back to the Jerma versus the Vumps.
[178:07.52]Fireman's carry onto Fat Jerma.
[178:09.08]I don't know how you can even pick him up, Peggy.
[178:10.56]That's remarkable.
[178:13.03]Don't let it be two Vumps versus me.
[178:15.51]Two Jermas versus two Vumps is never fun.
[178:20.09]Don't let it happen.
[178:20.95]jermaMoon is so huge.
[178:22.55]Just fucking pick somebody up and throw them over.
[178:24.69]Don't eliminate each other.
[178:26.55]Work together and get rid of the Vumps.
[178:32.01]Oh, you know what?
[178:32.37]Get rid of me.
[178:33.61]I'm okay with that.
[178:34.61]If you get rid of me, I'll be fine.
[178:35.83]But here comes another competitor.
[178:38.58]Who is it?
[178:40.34]It's a book-reading gorilla.
[178:41.48]Okay.
[178:44.72]Instantly going for a frog splash on no one.
[178:48.38]Currently, turnbuckle is still taken off.
[178:50.95]Jermuk is very, very likely to get eliminated here.
[178:55.87]Maybe not.
[178:56.75]No, I guess not.
[178:59.38]Peggy Vump is going to be one of those characters that does a ton of work.
[179:06.00]Yeah, here she goes.
[179:06.86]No, she can't lift him.
[179:07.50]Thank God.
[179:09.50]Did I say book reading a gorilla?
[179:11.66]Oh, here comes the book reading.
[179:14.42]No, no, no, not an elbow drop.
[179:16.30]Don't do an elbow drop, Dermaboon.
[179:19.10]Don't do it.
[179:22.76]Who did he do that to?
[179:24.36]Peggy bump, apparently.
[179:25.34]Here comes another contestant.
[179:28.18]Here comes Etalyx.
[179:29.10]It's the same thing.
[179:31.54]Oh, shit.
[179:32.44]The same thing's playing out.
[179:34.52]Etalyx is in the ring now.
[179:35.88]Jerm is in the ring.
[179:36.58]Jerm, a Moon, two bumps, and a Gorilla.
[179:43.84]Nobody do any elbow drops.
[179:46.52]I'm going right for Etalyx' penis.
[179:48.80]A penis stomp from Jerma to Etalyx.
[179:50.56]They're supposed to be friends.
[179:51.48]But sometimes they argue.
[179:52.67]Sometimes they argue about things.
[179:54.97]That's what happens.
[179:58.47]Etalyx with a reversal on Jerma.
[180:00.29]Has Peggy Bump and jermaMoon down in the bottom.
[180:02.34]Look to be having a little bit of a... No!
[180:04.36]Peggy Bump.
[180:06.21]Gets out of that.
[180:06.83]And Etalyx now is choking Jerma, trying to push him over the right side.
[180:11.98]Syringe clown.
[180:12.94]Okay, if the syringe clown comes in and gets drop kicked out.
[180:17.06]There goes the book reading a gorilla.
[180:20.49]There you go.
[180:21.11]Whatever.
[180:21.79]The gorilla.
[180:22.57]And Peggy bump.
[180:25.78]Peggy Kvump and the gorilla reading a book have both been eliminated, both with punches.
[180:29.98]We are down to one Vump, two Jermas, and one Etalyx currently in the ring.
[180:35.23]And we are praying that I don't go on the top rope.
[180:41.11]If I go on the top rope, I'm going to get so scared.
[180:43.31]I'm so scared already.
[180:45.65]You have to change the fucking timeline.
[180:47.95]Please, Etalyx, change the timeline.
[180:50.94]Get rid of me so we don't crash.
[180:54.23]Throw me out.
[180:55.13]Toss me to the fucking birds like bread out your fucking back window.
[180:58.31]Thank god.
[180:58.77]God damn it.
[181:01.23]I can't be eliminated.
[181:03.61]It's like a paradox or something.
[181:09.03]Oh, Rodney Hump is kicking the shit out of Dermamoon.
[181:15.07]We're getting close.
[181:15.97]We're at more than halfway.
[181:18.01]There's a ton of characters you haven't seen that are coming in.
[181:20.95]Get in here.
[181:21.87]Whoever are you?
[181:25.85]Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, it's Andrew Jack Kerry Jacked.
[181:36.98]Don't do this again.
[181:42.75]Don't.
[181:44.33]Don't.
[181:45.29]Don't do it.
[181:47.69]Don't do it.
[181:49.89]Andrew Jack Kerry Jacked.
[181:51.68]If the syringe clown is next.
[181:54.11]Double fucking fireman's carry.
[181:58.67]Oh, Etalyx, what the fuck are you doing?
[182:02.23]Oh, I am so nervous right now.
[182:03.71]I'm actually nervous.
[182:05.91]I'm getting to that point where, like, the timeline split, but it connected again.
[182:10.41]Dude, this is just like a fucking Telltale game.
[182:13.67]You think shit matters?
[182:14.71]No, it don't.
[182:15.23]It comes to the same conclusion.
[182:16.35]It's the syringe cloud.
[182:17.85]It's the syringe cloud.
[182:19.49]Come on, please.
[182:20.86]No.
[182:22.07]The Syringe Clown is here!
[182:23.11]No!
[182:23.17]No, it's gonna happen.
[182:30.39]It's gonna happen.
[182:31.01]He's gonna get thrown over by Andrew Jack Harry Jack.
[182:34.51]It's okay.
[182:34.91]The timeline's split again.
[182:35.79]We're good.
[182:38.13]The timeline is split again.
[182:41.75]We're all still in it.
[182:42.99]Syringe Clown from Until Dawn.
[182:45.19]He's getting his face wiped into the ground.
[182:50.43]Uh...
[182:51.93]There's a lot of action going on right now.
[182:53.84]Too many moves are going on.
[182:57.66]Jerma and Etalyx on the right side.
[182:58.88]Jerma, Boon, Rodney, Vump.
[183:00.68]And then Andrew, Jack, Kerry, Jack, and the Syringe Clown.
[183:03.12]No!
[183:03.74]I'm doing it again.
[183:05.28]I'm doing it again.
[183:07.49]This is exactly what happened.
[183:08.95]And then I did a move to Etalyx.
[183:10.63]And then I did a fucking elbow drop off the top rope and the game crashed.
[183:14.53]Somebody has to fucking split this timeline.
[183:18.78]Please.
[183:19.84]Have a divergence in the force.
[183:22.90]before I lose my shit.
[183:26.18]Syringe Clown, eliminate Andrew, Jack, every Jack right now.
[183:29.86]Give us a divergence.
[183:36.51]Metallics, fucking eliminate me, please.
[183:39.17]Not the other way around.
[183:40.63]No one's eliminated.
[183:42.49]It's just, it's inevitable.
[183:43.55]It's inevitable.
[183:44.03]It's just waiting for that one moment.
[183:46.02]The timeline can pretend to change.
[183:48.18]Eventually Syringe Clown's gonna get drop kicked over.
[183:51.08]I'm gonna go on the top ropes and elbow drop Game Crash.
[183:58.78]Somebody has to change the timeline.
[184:01.02]I don't know who it's gonna be.
[184:03.87]Oh, he went into the corner.
[184:04.97]Etalyx got thrown into the fucking metal.
[184:06.67]There we go.
[184:07.53]Rodney bump.
[184:08.13]All the bumps are gone.
[184:09.65]We technically have not changed the timeline.
[184:13.16]Now we did.
[184:14.10]Okay.
[184:14.52]Andrew, Jack, Kerry, Jack eliminated the Syringe Clan.
[184:18.00]We're good.
[184:18.96]Everything is at peace now.
[184:21.52]Timeline shifted.
[184:22.96]And there goes Jerma.
[184:23.62]Etalyx is going to eliminate jermaOn the corner.
[184:26.09]No, he's not.
[184:27.71]We've got jermaMoon, Andrew, Jack, Kerry, Jack, Fat Fuck Jerma, and Etalyx.
[184:33.89]Here comes the remainder of the fucking rumble.
[184:39.06]Syringe Clown died in the last timeline too.
[184:40.84]That's... I mean, I guess that's true.
[184:43.64]But he died in a different way.
[184:47.08]How do you not throw him over the top?
[184:49.74]Don't ask me how you don't just pick him up and throw him.
[184:51.10]If you're that strong, John Kerry.
[184:53.97]Don't do an elbow drop though.
[184:57.57]I love how the last like 10 straight minutes has been me fucking nervous hoping that there's no elbow drop.
[185:02.71]Here comes an elbow drop.
[185:03.61]Nope.
[185:07.05]Yeah, Etalyx and Jerma have been fighting this almost entire time they've been in there together.
[185:12.19]Here comes another contestant.
[185:15.23]Please welcome, ladies and gentlemen... Garfield!
[185:20.93]Come on, Garfield!
[185:22.39]Time to clean up!
[185:23.63]Time to clean up!
[185:24.83]Did you hear that one, honey?
[185:26.65]Sometimes my voice does that when I've been talking!
[185:30.41]Garfield's here to clean up the, uh, the timeline.
[185:38.42]Garfield is gonna... There goes Etalyx.
[185:41.73]Eliminated by Garfield.
[185:44.69]That's kind of... Etalyx, that's kind of... I mean, come on.
[185:48.83]You let Garfield eliminate you.
[185:50.95]That's fucking pathetic.
[185:53.47]How would you ever let Garfield eliminate you?
[185:57.77]Watch Garfield win.
[186:00.01]Big powerbomb from Andrew Jack, Kerry Jack.
[186:03.62]And incoming now.
[186:05.84]Incoming now...
[186:07.70]is EZP from Fallout New Vegas.
[186:12.33]A veteran of the series, he's... He was there last time.
[186:16.09]EZP is now in the Rumble.
[186:18.63]From the Fallout New Vegas stream.
[186:22.83]That bastard.
[186:25.24]I have high hopes.
[186:27.08]EZ-Pete came in at a really good time.
[186:28.45]There's like, there's like probably eight people left.
[186:30.75]And EZ-Pete's going right for jermaMoon.
[186:33.11]There he goes.
[186:34.73]One leg is on the apron.
[186:37.19]Will EZ-Pete eliminate jermaMoon?
[186:38.77]He will.
[186:40.35]First elimination from EZ-Pete going right for Garfield.
[186:43.76]Andrew Jack Kerry jacked.
[186:45.10]Jerma, Garfield, and EZ-Pete.
[186:48.02]Here are your four.
[186:50.22]And in comes number five.
[186:52.22]Not number five, the fifth one to be in the ring.
[186:56.75]Wait a minute, who's that?
[186:58.19]Who is that?
[186:59.69]Oh, I think I know who that is.
[187:01.72]That's Greg from NVIDIA.
[187:04.18]Welcome Greg from NVIDIA, giving out free shit.
[187:07.36]And that free shit is a free beating.
[187:09.90]On to Andrew Jackerry Jack.
[187:13.81]Came in and sliding in with his Hey Gamers line.
[187:16.47]Greg from NVIDIA.
[187:20.01]Making his debut.
[187:25.79]I thought he was gone instantly.
[187:28.61]Free shit!
[187:31.11]Don't worry, he just looks like a human version of Beaker from the Muppets.
[187:38.23]Pretty sick logo, though.
[187:40.62]Razor Death Adder must stop him.
[187:44.10]Now, Greg from NVIDIA.
[187:45.10]I don't know how long Greg from NVIDIA is going to last.
[187:48.12]Here comes another contestant.
[187:50.32]Right into the ropes.
[187:52.14]Ladies and gentlemen, it's Twitch Chat!
[187:54.00]It's Twitch Chat!
[187:55.30]Coming in right for Jerma.
[187:56.28]Jerma grabbed him right by the fucking neck.
[187:58.70]Twitch Chat making his debut.
[188:00.46]Trying to come in and call me all kinds of fucking names and shit.
[188:03.96]Jerma's gonna... Yeah, fuck Twitch Chat.
[188:06.17]Get it out of here.
[188:08.37]Please welcome Twitch Chat for the first time ever into the Jerma arena.
[188:13.99]No.
[188:14.63]No.
[188:15.49]Don't eliminate me.
[188:16.73]Don't eliminate me, Twitch Chat.
[188:19.68]Fucking twitch.tv!
[188:22.51]It's gonna happen.
[188:23.53]EZ-Pete's gonna go over, Garfield's gonna throw EZ-Pete over!
[188:26.33]Can he do it?
[188:28.27]There goes, no!
[188:34.71]EZ-Pete and Jerma have been eliminated.
[188:37.35]Twitch just eliminated Jerma.
[188:40.19]And there Garfield eliminated EZ-Pete.
[188:41.95]And there goes Andrew Jack Kerry Jack Garfield with another elimination.
[188:47.98]So all we've got left, we have Twitch Chat, Greg from NVIDIA, and Garfield.
[188:52.42]Are the ones remaining so far.
[188:53.82]There's a few more contestants.
[188:57.28]Fucking Twitch Chat eliminates me.
[188:59.74]Give me a fucking break.
[189:02.04]Blocking the suplex to Garfield.
[189:03.44]Twitch Chat gets that nice suplex.
[189:06.51]Game almost crashed.
[189:08.31]Right there.
[189:11.35]They're falling like flies.
[189:12.81]They're dropping like flies.
[189:16.39]Look at all those fucking kappas.
[189:17.99]Look at those knee kappas.
[189:21.05]It's Garfield now.
[189:21.99]You gotta get... Twitch chat needs to be eliminated.
[189:25.38]They gotta get out of here quickly.
[189:27.20]Remember, that's 5,300 people in one body.
[189:30.66]That's not fair.
[189:31.84]How is that fair?
[189:33.04]Garfield's a cat.
[189:34.50]Greg's a dude.
[189:36.01]You're going up against 5,300 fucking people in a body.
[189:39.67]How can you possibly even think that you're gonna go up against something like that?
[189:45.57]Now incoming into the ring as we get two sequences here.
[189:49.83]Ladies and gentlemen, that's John Marston from Red Dead Redemption.
[189:53.75]First ever appearance.
[189:55.47]John Marston.
[189:57.81]Not the undead nightmare John Marston.
[190:00.59]Just the regular John Marston.
[190:04.19]And he is a top seed.
[190:05.81]He's very good.
[190:07.29]Currently going after that free shit that he was promised from NVIDIA Greg.
[190:12.03]NVIDIA Greg though turns the tables on John Marston.
[190:16.26]Garfield in Twitch chat.
[190:18.32]This is the timeline, considering all the shit that Twitch chat has said to Garfield.
[190:22.57]Is Garfield going to get his revenge on Twitch chat once and for all?
[190:25.99]All those things, all those mean jokes that Twitch chat made about Garfield.
[190:29.69]No, doesn't get it, just barely.
[190:33.30]And we got another contestant coming into the ring.
[190:36.22]Twitch, here comes Captain Cheez-It.
[190:39.50]Captain Cheez-It, come save us.
[190:42.52]Captain Cheez-It can fucking instantly eliminate everybody!
[190:45.22]Please!
[190:46.22]Prove that you're the true competitor that we deserve!
[190:50.37]John Marston looks like he's in trouble from Captain Cheez-It!
[191:00.55]Oh, look at Twitch Cat!
[191:01.75]Twitch Cat has kitty paws!
[191:03.97]Whoa, Kappa!
[191:07.39]Reversal from Garfield!
[191:10.19]As NVIDIA Greg and Captain Cheez-It
[191:15.87]Why is Twitch Chat and Garfield still fighting?
[191:19.28]Another contestant's coming in.
[191:20.90]Full ring incoming.
[191:24.02]Who is one of the final contestants?
[191:26.74]It's the Hollow Knight!
[191:28.26]From Hollow Knight!
[191:29.94]One of Turbo's favorite games this year!
[191:33.44]Nice move, by the way.
[191:36.02]He must have upgraded that from the blacksmith.
[191:47.07]John Marston was just holding his teeth.
[191:51.72]Go Twitch chat.
[191:52.88]Twitch chat if they fucking win.
[191:54.70]If Twitch chat wins.
[191:56.70]You know how upset that would make me?
[191:58.42]Twitch chat with a spinning roundhouse kick.
[192:01.54]Eliminates Garfield.
[192:03.30]They finally get their revenge as Captain Cheez-It was just doing a handstand.
[192:08.59]Showing off that he can do Pilates.
[192:10.25]He does yoga every fucking day.
[192:11.81]Look at this guy.
[192:12.77]How could you not?
[192:16.16]And of course, they're going to go from Garfield to NVIDIA Greg.
[192:19.51]They want that free shit.
[192:21.17]They were lied to.
[192:22.83]Greg from NVIDIA didn't give them free shit.
[192:24.93]Greg from NVIDIA gave them like a couple of buttons at PAX.
[192:28.13]They didn't get any free shit.
[192:30.63]Hollow Knight is now taking charge.
[192:33.85]Get rekt.
[192:37.49]Twitch chat is... I think Twitch chat might be reconnecting.
[192:42.46]No, he's just hanging out.
[192:44.49]He's hanging on Twitch chat now?
[192:45.75]No, he still wants Greg.
[192:47.97]But NVIDIA Greg's not gonna take all that shit.
[192:51.41]I mean, like, NVIDIA Greg's... To NVIDIA Greg's defense... Free shit.
[192:55.93]You know what I mean?
[192:56.57]Like, give it up free shit sometime.
[192:58.63]Even if it's a button.
[192:59.91]And, like, two stickers.
[193:01.94]And an advertisement.
[193:03.48]Where you have to go, like, register to be, like, eligible to win, like, 30 bucks.
[193:07.80]It's still free shit!
[193:09.32]And don't ever tell anybody that it's different.
[193:15.73]Twitch chat is... Oh, they're trying to go for Hollow Knight now.
[193:20.91]Captain Cheez-It's got John Marston over on the side.
[193:22.89]Don't pay attention to that.
[193:25.19]Big right hand.
[193:25.92]Cheez-It has eliminated John Marston.
[193:29.88]He was really top seed too.
[193:31.36]I'm not lying.
[193:31.98]He had a lot of high stats.
[193:34.02]But stats don't matter apparently.
[193:36.36]Only fucking perseverance does.
[193:38.42]And if you have perseverance, you are Twitch chat.
[193:42.78]That is absolutely what you are made out of.
[193:46.54]NVIDIA Greg, Captain Cheez-It, Twitch Chat, and Hollow Knight.
[193:51.96]These might be the last four... Oh, there goes Twitch Chat!
[193:55.28]Hollow Knight's gonna eliminate Twitch Chat!
[193:56.99]Wait, Captain Cheez-It!
[193:58.57]Captain Cheez-It's gonna stop it!
[194:00.33]No, Captain Cheez-It's gonna, like, bump into him over and over again!
[194:02.69]Twitch Chat's on the verge!
[194:03.91]It could be it!
[194:04.97]It's in for Twitch Chat!
[194:06.25]No!
[194:07.53]It is!
[194:08.55]It isn't!
[194:09.61]It is!
[194:09.97]It isn't!
[194:13.69]Everybody was talking shit about Captain Cheez-It.
[194:16.01]Captain Cheez-It just tried to save Twitch chat.
[194:21.33]I think these are the final four.
[194:22.53]I think this is it.
[194:25.17]This is it.
[194:26.81]Here are your final four.
[194:29.43]NVIDIA Greg, Captain Cheez-It, Hollow Knight, and Twitch chat.
[194:36.02]Captain Cheez-It is going to eliminate Greg right now.
[194:42.61]He's got him.
[194:43.09]No, not quite.
[194:44.09]Hollow Knight is still fighting.
[194:49.15]Yeah, this makes sense too.
[194:50.99]Because I remember I streamed Hollow Knight for like four streams in a row.
[194:54.34]And when I got to like the fourth stream, everybody was like, fuck this game.
[194:57.32]This game sucks.
[194:58.04]Move on to another game as NVIDIA Greg has got Captain Cheez-It on the ropes.
[195:03.06]Captain Cheez-It!
[195:04.17]Oh, just barely.
[195:05.37]Not quite.
[195:07.03]Almost Greg.
[195:07.89]NVIDIA Greg almost with an elimination there.
[195:11.16]Going forward again.
[195:12.94]We... No, Captain Cheez-It is very, very strong.
[195:16.86]Who knows if Captain Cheez-It's going to be the victor.
[195:20.24]I would be okay with a Captain Cheez-It victory.
[195:22.61]Dangerous.
[195:24.19]Dangerous, Captain Cheez-It.
[195:25.47]You don't want to do that.
[195:27.71]If you can get TwitchChat's attention, that's not going to be a good thing.
[195:30.39]He went for one punch to his face.
[195:31.81]This is getting too intense.
[195:36.53]TwitchChat currently working on that left leg of Hollow Knight.
[195:40.81]Neck breaker there onto NVIDIA Greg.
[195:43.83]Here we go.
[195:44.99]We have a chance here.
[195:46.03]Twitch chat has a chance to eliminate Hollow Knight.
[195:48.71]Is it going to happen?
[195:49.31]Are we going to see Hollow Knight eliminated?
[195:52.53]Big leg drop onto NVIDIA.
[195:54.15]There it is.
[195:55.12]There it is.
[195:56.02]The final three.
[195:57.62]Captain Cheez-It, Twitch chat, and NVIDIA Greg.
[196:02.60]And now NVIDIA Greg.
[196:04.10]NVIDIA Greg is gone.
[196:06.28]Captain Cheez-It.
[196:08.04]Wait a minute.
[196:09.21]He took two lives!
[196:10.11]He... Oh, no, he just wanted to look at him.
[196:13.19]Captain Cheez-It versus Twitch Chat as the final two.
[196:18.85]Place your bets as to who's going to win.
[196:22.69]No, instantly Twitch Chat's gonna be gone.
[196:25.36]Fight it, Twitch Chat!
[196:26.60]You can do it!
[196:27.58]Put in some fucking PogChamps!
[196:29.60]Captain Cheez-It!
[196:30.94]Captain Cheez-It has a chance!
[196:32.82]Is it gonna happen?
[196:34.42]Oh, God!
[196:35.26]It's over!
[196:36.12]That's it!
[196:39.48]Captain Cheez-It is your Gerber Rumble champion.
[196:46.86]There it is.
[196:52.68]Captain fucking Cheez-It.
[196:58.32]Oh, that was so close.
[197:04.87]NVIDIA Greg did a fucking great job, by the way.
[197:07.33]Rigged.
[197:10.41]Jesus.
[197:10.71]Sponsored.
[197:11.21]Redo.
[197:11.75]Redo.
[197:37.80]Oh, he's pointing to WrestleMania.
[197:40.44]You guys see how fucking horrible this is gonna be?
[197:43.58]I have to have Captain Cheez-It and the Fire Serpent, like, die in a car crash.
[197:49.44]Fucking really.
[197:50.70]That can't be the title match.
[198:01.05]Cheez-It.
[198:07.55]I gotta, I gotta make my applause for TwitchChat there.
[198:11.17]Uh, TwitchChat... TwitchChat was supposed to get instantly eliminated.
[198:16.69]That was the joke.
[198:18.81]TwitchChat doesn't have, like, any stats.
[198:22.92]Any.
[198:25.74]TwitchChat stayed in there for so long and eliminated, like, fucking four people.
[198:30.34]That would've been so fucking funny.
[198:33.28]The joke was like he was gonna come in and get, like, fucking instantly eliminated.
[198:39.72]Captain Cheezit's stats are actually really not that great either.
[198:49.71]5,000 people are difficult to eliminate.
[198:51.69]Twitch chat finds a way.
[198:55.35]They do.
[198:58.36]Alright.
[199:00.22]Well.
[199:03.36]If you guys want to do like an exhibition match, I will.
[199:05.42]I want to do one thing before I go.
[199:09.78]Sold out to the big cheese.
[199:15.20]Uh, if you were just here for the Rumble, thank you for watching.
[199:19.99]Hopefully it was entertaining.
[199:21.57]I'm sorry about those fucking horrible, horrible crashes.
[199:25.33]The one crash that, the one crash was the worst.
[199:30.31]Uh, there's your Rumble champion, Captain Cheez-It.
[199:34.39]Uh, yeah.
[199:35.78]Thank you so much for watching that.
[199:37.08]We're gonna do one thing.
[199:38.00]I wanna try to get somebody to go out and sell.
[199:43.46]5,000 people eliminated by Cheezus.
[199:48.42]Where was Herman Munster?
[199:50.46]I ran out of time.
[199:52.51]There was, like, three other characters I wanted to make.
[199:54.59]Herman Munster was one of them.
[199:57.17]But I just, like, couldn't.
[199:58.37]Like, I had shit to do yesterday that I didn't foresee.
[200:04.39]And, uh, yeah.
[200:06.89]Ugh.
[200:08.55]Some of that shit was fucking hilarious, though.
[200:11.19]But I do want to see if I can get somebody to go on a cell.
[200:13.61]Do we want to do Cheez-It versus... We'll do Twitch chat versus Cheez-It in a Hell in a Cell.
[200:19.80]And I want to climb the cage.
[200:21.38]I know you can.
[200:21.94]But nobody ever does it.

[201:07.48]Thanks a lot, dude.
[201:08.80]Scarlo, thanks for the 1,500 bits, the 15 bucks.

[201:17.42]Yeah, I mean, I... This is the second one I've done, like, on stream.
[201:22.82]And how it's been working is, like, the last, like, few months, the last, like, six months of streams...
[201:29.21]All, like, the dumb jokes and, like, random characters and stuff, like, can kind of make their way into a rumble.
[201:34.52]So, we'll see.

[201:41.46]But thank you, Scarlo.

[201:51.53]Was Twitch chat wrestler a screenshot of this chat or just Google Images?
[201:54.87]It was a screenshot of this chat.
[201:57.54]Saying like streamer sucks, like this guy sucks, like game sucks and stuff like that.
[202:01.68]Some people help me out with them.
[202:04.72]So thanks to those people that were in the chat when I asked them to do that.
[202:08.58]Also, StixRenegade, thanks for the $5.
[202:09.68]I suddenly hate Cheez-Its for some reason.
[202:14.97]StixRenegade again with $5.
[202:16.91]We won, now play Spore.
[202:18.97]You didn't win.
[202:19.55]Twitch chat didn't win.
[202:23.30]Mostly lost.
[202:24.00]Gave another $15.
[202:26.30]Grab another drink on me, Jerma.

[202:30.90]I didn't have notifications on this whole stream, so sorry I missed all these.
[202:36.81]That was a rigged match.
[202:38.55]No, it wasn't a rigged match.
[202:41.59]Captain Cheez-It could have come in at any point.
[202:44.13]He came in at number 22 or 23.
[202:45.59]He was in there for a little while.
[202:51.00]LamBlam666 gave $50 earlier.
[202:55.88]This stream is fucking rad.
[202:57.02]Well, thank you.
[202:57.46]If you're still here, LamBlam, thanks a lot for the money.
[202:59.24]That's a lot of money.
[203:01.40]Yurok, if you're new to the stream, then you just gave me $50 and you're like brand new.
[203:07.66]Thanks a lot.
[203:09.12]That's more than I could ever imagine somebody would give to the stream.
[203:13.54]KXZ, thanks for the $30.
[203:16.67]That would have made... That elbow drop would have made Randy Savage proud.
[203:22.87]Yes, it would have.
[203:25.01]Also, let me just... Don't want to miss any of the... Like, some of the larger ones.
[203:29.04]Mr. Sneakman, thanks for the $15.
[203:30.02]It was me.
[203:31.74]I crashed your game.

[203:45.88]Jesus Christ, man.
[203:46.72]Thanks.
[203:46.94]You've given fucking like $400 or $500.
[203:51.76]Thank you so much.
[203:54.22]Alright.
[203:55.00]Let's just try one thing before I go.
[203:56.36]I'm going to be live tomorrow.
[203:58.52]I'm not sure what I'm going to play, but there's a couple of options that I would want to play, so... I will see you guys tomorrow, those of you that are leaving.
[204:07.21]And let me... Where is it?
[204:10.95]Okay.
[204:11.35]Let's go just one-on-one.
[204:14.03]Hell in a Cell.
[204:17.09]Like, I want to get up there.
[204:18.35]I'm going to play it.
[204:18.87]I don't even know how to play the game.
[204:21.78]Let's do it with... Let's fucking play as Dr. Oak.
[204:28.28]Versus, like, I don't know, fucking Andrew Jack Harry Jack.
[204:32.40]I want to, like... I don't even know how... I don't even know the buttons.
[204:34.52]I don't even know how to play the game.
[204:37.22]WWE 2K17.
[204:40.38]I just want to climb up the cell.
[204:46.65]Versus the fire serpent?
[204:47.73]No.
[204:53.58]That face.
[204:55.78]Me versus me.
[205:00.98]Oh, the number was supposed to be a heart.
[205:02.62]So have some more bits.
[205:03.48]Well, thanks Lost for the ten more dollars.
[205:10.00]You have to powerbomb the cell open?
[205:11.66]You do.
[205:12.60]How the fuck do you do that?
[205:17.08]Like, hundreds of hours in the game and I don't even know the game's controls.
[205:21.88]Something about that makes me laugh.
[205:29.47]You need to have the escape artist skill and then do an oh my god move at the bottom right of the ring to go outside.
[205:34.71]That seems fairly elaborate.
[205:36.17]I don't think that's gonna work.
[205:38.09]So, and this is like still stuck in loading.
[205:41.67]So...
[205:44.63]Alright, I guess that's gonna be it.
[205:46.61]I don't think any of you guys have that.
[205:47.97]Alright, I'm just gonna call it.
[205:51.17]That's it.
[205:52.40]Might as well.
[205:55.04]Oh, you want me to, like, flex on camera?
[205:56.46]Here, fine.
[205:59.64]I think the game may have crashed.
[206:00.96]It actually may have.
[206:08.67]Anywho...
[206:11.19]Where's my webcam so I can do this without showing my waist because I'm wearing my fucking underwear.
[206:16.50]There was a ton of people tonight.
[206:17.52]This stream is, I think, one of the biggest streams I've had the pleasure of hosting.
[206:23.60]There were like five, six thousand people here at some point, so... I hope you enjoyed it.
[206:29.70]I do this shit from time to time.
[206:33.07]Hopefully it was fun and funny.
[206:35.95]And... yeah.
[206:37.53]Thanks for sticking around.
[206:39.97]I'm going to just plug my webcam in and just flex and then end the stream.
[206:44.17]Good night, everybody.
[206:48.52]You're going to hear a window sound.
[206:56.43]Alright.
[207:06.21]And this is where I'm going to flex and then end spring.
[207:10.71]Is it working?
[207:14.97]I don't think it's working.
[207:36.68]It's fucking broken.
[207:38.08]Oh, uh, OBS just crashed.
[207:40.43]That's the problem.
[207:41.09]Yep, OBS is not responding.
[207:47.63]I wish this was a lie, but it's not a lie.
[207:51.47]I, honest to God, wish this was a joke, but it's not.
[207:56.05]OBS is not responding.
[208:01.05]Prove it?
[208:01.49]Okay, I'll post a picture on Twitter?
[208:03.01]Sure.
[208:04.23]I'll prove it.
[208:05.77]I can do that.
[208:06.27]I can prove that.
[208:07.53]Here we go.
[208:15.31]There it is.
[208:16.29]Not responding.
[208:20.09]Alright, that's it.
[208:22.42]I have to force quit out of here.
[208:27.72]I can't physically get out.
[208:30.51]Uh, OBS64EC is not responding.
[208:32.04]Alright.
[208:32.60]Goodnight, everybody.
[208:33.84]Thank you so much.
[208:35.56]Everybody that stuck around, I love you guys.
[208:37.92]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[208:40.88]And, like, I'm hearing crackles and shit.
[208:42.34]Like, something's not right.
[208:43.41]Alright.
[208:44.95]Goodnight, guys.
