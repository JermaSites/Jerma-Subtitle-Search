[00:01.90]Alright everyone, welcome back to the Tip of the Hats 2014.
[00:05.53]We are raising money for One Step Camp, a non-profit organization that provides children coping with cancer the opportunity to experience childhood.
[00:13.28]They send them to camp, it's a great cause.
[00:16.10]We have a whole lot of raffles.
[00:18.17]You can go to our donate page for watching through twitch.tv/tipofthehats.
[00:22.35]You can scroll down, you can
[00:23.45]all our info, and actually in this hour, when we were doing our pubbing, we're going to be hosting a timed raffle.
[00:31.18]So there'll be information on that, and we'll get that to you.
[00:34.41]But I'm here with Kip.
[00:36.11]Hello, Kip.
[00:37.03]Hello, Bloodsire.
[00:38.37]And yeah, the timed raffle going on for about an hour should be really good.
[00:41.72]There's a strange Australian ambassador signed by none other than Stabby Stabby, who we actually have in server right now.
[00:49.61]So we're doing some clubbing, and also there's a strange Gunslinger going on for raffle too, so it's a $5 minimum donation.
[00:56.78]So definitely donate.
[00:57.56]You have 56 minutes left, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01.63]Wow, so a golden weapon signed by the best spy in the game.
[01:06.92]Is that what I'm hearing?
[01:08.68]I didn't sign it.
[01:09.28]We talked about it.
[01:11.18]Oh, shots fired.
[01:11.74]Oh, we'll just say one of the best, Stabby.
[01:14.57]Stabby's here with us in chat too.
[01:16.33]Stabby, you want to say hi?
[01:17.55]Hi.
[01:19.21]solid they don't backstab me you doing I'm gonna do it oh boy give me oh boy oh hey oh hang on so you obviously know the voice that is star back with us for another pub and it looks like we got who do we got back in here Jerma's in here with us too so we're just gonna have a lot of fun bringing all of what they're doing but also just messing around as we go for with this pub hour my name is Jeremy hi I played the game I didn't play this video game today
[01:48.01]How long you play?
[01:49.56]Day to day.
[01:51.08]Where did the Titans go?
[01:52.88]Turtle Crawl.
[01:55.50]I'm so glad that's a thing.
[01:57.16]I really am.
[01:58.99]I think I missed most of that, but I enjoyed being on the same page as Mini-Wheat when that was going on, just having no idea and just be like, oh yeah, turtles!
[02:07.07]I like turtles!
[02:08.79]Mini-Wheat was adorable, by the way.
[02:10.18]That was really good.
[02:11.18]I'm glad actually that he was able to do that, because we are doing this for children, and
[02:16.94]It kind of offered a nice perspective on what we're doing this for.
[02:20.28]Just to hear how jovial and happy he was getting to play and do something he loves.
[02:24.25]And that's sort of an opportunity that children who are going through something as difficult as cancer don't really always have the opportunity to do.
[02:30.86]And so One Step Camp, it gives them that.
[02:32.86]And it was great to get that sort of perspective by having Miniweed here.
[02:36.92]So that was nice.
[02:37.64]Yeah, absolutely.
[02:38.40]And that was one thing I wanted to talk about.
[02:39.63]Bloodsire, have you ever been to summer camp as a kid?
[02:42.45]Did you ever do that?
[02:43.65]No, actually I haven't.
[02:44.67]I haven't been to summer camp.
[02:45.63]Alright, we're going to start a new fund.
[02:47.62]It's to get Bloodsire to summer camp.
[02:49.04]To kid summer camp.
[02:50.06]Hey, I've never been to summer camp.
[02:52.82]Oh, okay.
[02:53.28]How did you... Did you like it?
[02:54.61]Was it not the best time of your life?
[02:55.73]I said I've never been to summer camp.
[02:56.65]Oh, you've never been?
[02:57.25]I feel left out.
[02:58.07]You're doing charities for him now to get him to summer camp.
[03:01.25]How many people here have been to summer camp?
[03:03.42]Fine.
[03:03.50]Hashtag Sunstar to summer camp stabby have you been do you want it on this?
[03:06.81]Oh, that's why I'm a well-adjusted individual.
[03:09.28]I
[03:11.77]Like some people here.
[03:13.67]Oh.
[03:13.97]But yeah, it's just such a good time.
[03:16.75]I can't imagine the poor, poor vacant souls who have not been able to experience best summers of my childhood, I think.
[03:24.84]Pretty much.
[03:25.91]So yeah, definitely get in on that action.
[03:27.23]And remember, donate in the next 53 minutes.
[03:30.53]You'll be able to be eligible for the Strange Australian Ambassador signed by Stabby and an Estranged Gunslinger.
[03:37.46]I offered to sign it, but they said that would take down the value, so I didn't.
[03:41.95]Star, how pumped are you to win that Strange Gunslinger, man?
[03:45.62]It's gotta be on your list, right?
[03:47.28]Strange Gunslingers being given away?
[03:48.86]Is that what you're telling me?
[03:50.93]You're going to enable someone with this, is what you're doing.
[03:54.37]Not excited.
[03:55.67]You should have Star sign it in blood.
[03:56.99]Now, haven't you played Platinum Engineer?
[03:59.86]Don't you have an affinity for that weapon?
[04:02.98]Star loves playing Engineer in Highlander.
[04:07.03]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[04:08.11]There's a gold Gunslinger?
[04:11.79]Is that what I'm hearing?
[04:13.37]No, this one's just strange.
[04:14.85]Oh, yeah, because that was in, like, number 40 crate or something like that.
[04:19.38]I understand the situation.
[04:21.87]No, you don't.
[04:22.79]I really don't.
[04:23.51]I'm pretending.
[04:26.81]So, yeah, that's until 8 p.m.
[04:28.76]Eastern Time, so definitely get your donations in.
[04:30.64]$5 minimum donation for that silent raffle, I guess you could call it.
[04:35.09]I guess all raffles are kind of silent, though.
[04:39.28]Actually, what you do is, if you just donate within this hour, you'll be eligible.
[04:43.99]You'll be entered into that raffle.
[04:48.68]Along with any other donation incentive you would have normally gotten.
[04:51.88]So if you're going to donate and that's something you want, it seems like, do it now.
[04:56.73]Best time.
[04:59.38]So here we are on the pubbing on Swiftwater.
[05:02.00]How do you guys like this map as a pub?
[05:03.51]Because I know it's seen a lot of competitive action.
[05:05.13]In fact, it was solicited by UGC, the main Highlander competitive league, to become a payload map.
[05:10.74]But in pubs?
[05:13.29]Question mark?
[05:14.19]Stabby, I'm going to start with you because I know you play it a lot in pubs.
[05:18.73]He apparently hasn't.
[05:20.31]Oh, he's gone.
[05:20.84]Alright, so Star, you had something to say.
[05:22.20]Yeah, yeah, I've had this on my server for a long time.
[05:24.94]I think it's great.
[05:25.58]Like, a lot of people actually know this map because it's been in Highlander.
[05:29.33]It's not, like, just some weird Highlander map.
[05:31.83]I mean, some weird, like, random map that people don't know where to go.
[05:35.31]And I'm all for any map in a pub that has, like, wide open multiple areas to go for, like, all the goofy stuff that can go on.
[05:43.17]You mean market gardening?
[05:45.11]I just mean, like, you got your space.
[05:46.59]Like, everyone needs their space.
[05:47.63]We got some space.
[05:51.00]Alright, well, the first round is over.
[05:52.82]We're not keeping track of time, but if we were, I think that was like a 20 minute time or something?
[05:57.45]Blue team, get it together.
[05:58.85]The blue team's got a whole lot of stars over there, including star, so you would think that, uh... I just got here!
[06:06.96]Bottom of the scoreboard.
[06:08.08]I just got here!
[06:09.64]Bottom.
[06:11.08]Meanwhile, we got a 15 killstreak with our top heavy, but we are changing server, or changing maps right there.
[06:17.15]Um, it was unanimously voted Upward by, like, everyone.
[06:20.94]Except one person didn't want it.
[06:23.26]And that person was promptly kicked.
[06:25.02]It's probably Jerma.
[06:26.07]I wanted to go to Harvest.
[06:31.23]Alright, let's talk about Upward.
[06:32.47]Oh, no, we're going to Borneo?
[06:33.54]What?
[06:34.12]What?
[06:35.62]Oh, yeah, Borneo.
[06:36.74]I actually... Lang asked me for the suggestion of maps on the server, so I gave him all the weird ones.
[06:43.45]So we have you to blame for this.
[06:46.74]I like Borneo.
[06:47.66]It's a pretty good map.
[06:49.18]So while we're changing maps here, I just want to take a moment to remind everybody about some of the raffles we have going on.
[06:54.67]Right now, if you donate within the next 10 minutes, at least $5, you'll be eligible to win a, I believe it's a strange Australian ambassador signed by none other than Stabby Stabby.
[07:05.57]And we also have a strange Gunslinger going to be giving away.
[07:08.11]So any donation over $5 in the next 49 minutes will make you eligible for those.
[07:13.62]And also, if you're in the whole signed items thing and you want signed items from Star, DJ Wheat, DJ Mini Wheat, Banny, and now Stabby, you can go to our Steam Community page at steamcommunity.com slash group slash tip of the hats.
[07:28.36]I forgot what I was saying for a second there.
[07:30.47]Long day.
[07:31.74]Or, alternatively, you can go to our Twitch page, scroll down, look at the Donate section.
[07:36.13]At the very bottom of that, there's a link to our signed auctions.
[07:38.59]You can hear Young Mela typing fiercely to try to get into this pub server, kicking many people while he's doing it.
[07:45.44]So, yeah, you can enter into those signed auctions, try to get some signed items from your favorite players.
[07:51.18]Now, I have a question, Lang.
[07:53.30]I have a question.
[07:53.88]Where do I donate so I can adopt DJ Mini-Wheat?
[07:57.25]You'd have to ask Marcus about that.
[07:59.59]DJ Mastery.
[08:02.30]That was probably my favorite event so far.
[08:05.35]But we still got surfing coming up.
[08:06.77]Oh my god, are you guys so pumped for that?
[08:08.69]Very, very pumped.
[08:10.39]I don't know what they're doing.
[08:11.20]I don't know what the exact plan is, who's surfing.
[08:14.02]I don't see how it could be bad.
[08:15.86]They're getting a lot of the top surfers.
[08:17.48]I actually installed Counter-Strike Source for this surfing thing.
[08:21.17]Really?
[08:21.43]That's how awesome it's going to be.
[08:23.33]We didn't have any CS last year.
[08:26.04]Well, they're not playing, is it?
[08:26.96]I guess the Counter-Strike Source surfing is...
[08:29.83]The movement is a bit different, so you can get, I mean, greater speeds, I think, in Counter-Strike Source, so that's why they're doing that.
[08:38.11]You also have a smaller hitbox on your character.
[08:41.06]Yeah, we'll wait till then, just saying, you should be hyped for it.
[08:45.10]That is coming up at 10 p.m.
[08:46.80]Eastern, so definitely stay tuned for that.
[08:48.97]It's just been an awesome day.
[08:50.09]I haven't closed my Twitch window all day, just watching all this action.
[08:57.40]which is going to be similar to the MGE tournament.
[08:59.86]Ulti duo is combos fighting, so medic, soldiers.
[09:04.47]I'm guessing similar 18 bracket.
[09:06.37]I'm not sure if it's 18 or not, but that'll be really fun.
[09:08.95]I think, Bloodsire, are we doing that thing?
[09:10.84]Yeah, that's the one I thought we were doing before, but actually we're doing it next hour at 8 o'clock.
[09:14.68]So, yeah, that's going to be me and you.
[09:16.46]I'm excited for that one.
[09:17.32]I was so excited I even thought we were doing it earlier.
[09:19.73]We got it on the star.
[09:20.89]that strategy and also be reading your guys donations like we tried to get we missed a bunch during b-ball because it's so action-packed and I went to go get more honey what was it funny something Fritos funny barbecue you know anybody over there

[09:57.13]Hashtag for the kids.
[09:58.71]And then a random number three.

[10:41.21]This was the map that earlier we had that great pledge to, what was it, $100?
[10:47.48]Oh, God.
[10:49.10]This is Jerma.
[10:50.54]For Jerma market gardening somebody, and I actually did it.
[10:53.71]I think it was a $250 Market Gardener.
[10:57.53]It was like the most expensive kill in CS2 history, right?
[11:00.20]You're just going to get a crit like that.
[11:02.00]Wrecked.
[11:04.43]Gemma, take it down.
[11:05.16]Star right there.
[11:06.14]Gemma on a little bit of a streak right now.
[11:08.48]It's just one.
[11:09.45]Oh, two streak.
[11:10.81]Two streak?
[11:11.47]Hey, two is a streak.
[11:12.33]It's a little bit.
[11:13.15]Oh, you want to see this rocket jump?
[11:15.20]Check this one out.
[11:16.76]Don't do it.
[11:20.57]I'm going to throw down the next Jerma challenge.
[11:24.87]In honor of Stabby Stabby being here, if you get a stair stab, I'll donate $150.
[11:31.82]I'm not going to get a stair stab.
[11:32.88]More than that, come on.
[11:34.50]Don't do me like that, Star.
[11:35.51]$150.
[11:36.03]No, no, no.
[11:37.73]I am talking to Jerma.
[11:39.93]Jerma gets the stair stab.
[11:41.17]That's just not going to happen.
[11:42.15]That's not going to happen.
[11:42.94]Jerma gets the stair stab.
[11:44.12]You're not even going to try.
[11:44.98]This is a throw down.
[11:46.16]What is it?
[11:46.78]I'll try.
[11:48.34]Explain it to the dumb slash me.
[11:50.95]Is it when you jump over somebody on stairs and stab them?
[11:53.31]Someone is walking up the stairs, you jump over their head in order to reach their back, and then you grope their back to their death.
[12:00.58]You totally do that.
[12:01.68]Go find some stairs and sit there.
[12:03.57]That's what I'm gonna do.
[12:05.17]Hashtag believe.
[12:06.85]Dermot, it's for the kids.
[12:07.75]You gotta at least try.
[12:08.89]I'm talking about for the kids.
[12:11.19]We just brought $43,000.
[12:13.69]$43,000.
[12:14.92]Of course, we want to remind you guys that throughout this entire hour, in honor of Stabby being with us, we are doing a timed raffle during this hour.
[12:25.14]If you donate now, in addition to whatever you choose to donate on the donate page, whatever raffle you decide to enter yourself into, you will also be entered into the raffle for a golden
[12:35.15]Strange Ambassador signed by Stabby himself, a highly awesome item, and that'll be yours, you'll be entered into that when you donate within this hour, so definitely go ahead and do that.
[12:46.77]Just broke 43k, let's see if we can get to 44k, can we do it?
[12:50.77]You'll also donate, if you donate within the next, before 8pm Eastern Time, you'll also be entered for the chance to rent a Strange Gunslinger, which could be used to kill Star.
[13:02.22]That might be the kill that tips him over the edge.
[13:04.98]Of course, it doesn't need to be a strange Gunslinger to kill Star.
[13:07.75]Any Gunslinger would do it.
[13:08.95]Any Gunslinger would do it, really, yeah.
[13:10.13]Yeah, people have been doing it all day, and you keep mentioning it, so more people do it.
[13:13.53]Not happy about the situation.
[13:14.93]Also, Jerma, you can't stage this.
[13:17.22]Referees will inspect your Eclipse.
[13:21.48]Official stream referees.
[13:25.87]I don't even know what the stairs are in this map.
[13:30.54]The MC Escher room is your stair.
[13:37.29]What if he designed a map?
[13:38.47]That would be the best.
[13:40.23]It's nuts in there.
[13:40.93]I don't know why they changed Borneo.
[13:42.45]It never used to have this room.
[13:44.11]They don't even leave anywhere.
[13:45.86]It's just stairs.
[13:47.00]You go upstairs so you can find the stair, and then you get to the top where there's nothing.
[13:51.98]You can complain to Vaylin about that, who's been hard at work on improving this.
[13:57.00]Well, Vaylin did a shit job.
[14:00.06]It's much better, though.
[14:01.26]It's much, much easier to attack last.
[14:03.64]Still a work in progress.
[14:05.03]I do just that one MC Escher room, I got some problems with.
[14:07.99]Alright, alright.
[14:08.63]Fair enough.
[14:09.75]That prompted Lan to type roasted into that.
[14:12.53]Get the camera, get the camera, get your cameras ready, get your cameras ready.
[14:15.38]This is it.
[14:15.82]This is the one.
[14:16.32]Get your cameras ready.
[14:17.96]Are we on Terminus Cam?
[14:19.70]Get your cameras ready, guys.
[14:20.56]Just get your cameras ready.
[14:23.88]Okay, he's on stairs.
[14:24.92]He's camping stairs, ladies and gentlemen.
[14:26.38]He's a pro strat.
[14:27.44]Stabby, did you tutor Jerma privately for this?
[14:30.75]Uh, yeah.
[14:32.37]I was tutored privately.
[14:34.46]We need someone with the carts over here.
[14:35.96]Alright, get your cameras ready.
[14:36.68]Pretty sure everyone is on the cart.
[14:39.22]Alright, get your cameras ready, everybody.
[14:41.35]This is it right here.
[14:42.03]Is he gonna pull it off?
[14:44.05]I got this.
[14:44.45]He's gonna pull something.
[14:46.17]Got this.
[14:49.38]Solid.
[14:50.71]Well, there's nowhere I could go.
[14:51.79]There was no stairs.
[14:52.69]No one was on the stairs.
[14:54.01]No stairs.
[14:55.58]It was beautiful.
[14:56.12]It was a Market Gardener coming in on the cart.
[14:58.52]Not going to happen right there.
[14:59.54]Blue team pushing forward.
[15:00.94]Valently.
[15:02.37]Man, a red... Oh, no!
[15:03.29]Oh, what?
[15:04.53]Who scrambles the charity?
[15:08.35]No!
[15:08.71]That scramble was not for the kids.
[15:11.30]That scramble was extremely against kids.
[15:14.24]It was rated R, if you will.
[15:15.94]It was rated R for... Raunchy.
[15:19.75]Well, while we're here on Borneo RC3, I got to ask the main comp man of this mumble right here.
[15:26.98]Stabby, what do you think of this map?
[15:30.43]You know, this is my first time pubbing it.
[15:33.53]I think.
[15:34.89]And it's interesting.
[15:37.12]You know, in comp, it's just famous for its last point being an absolute... ...bad word.
[15:44.59]It's just one of the hardest points to cap in payload, you know, so...
[15:50.55]Other than that, I don't know.
[15:51.77]I like it.
[15:52.15]There's a lot of sneaky spots and you can get pretty creative with it as a spy.
[15:56.74]It's also really pretty.
[15:58.72]Yeah, that last point is tricky.
[16:01.25]It is pretty.
[16:02.11]It's lush.
[16:02.37]Do you feel like there's mountains in the distance in the fog?
[16:05.63]Oh, look at that.
[16:06.29]I would like to wake up in a bed here and look out on that sight.
[16:09.98]It's beautiful.
[16:11.04]I wouldn't.
[16:11.52]That would be really creepy.
[16:13.83]What?
[16:13.95]Just wake up in a jungle?
[16:14.49]Right next to the logs?
[16:15.99]I'd feel like being in my bathroom.
[16:17.95]We have a hundred... hundred dollar donation from TheKind who says, simply for the chillins.
[16:26.94]Thank you, TheKind.
[16:29.26]Good name.
[16:32.59]Oh, Seth's coming.
[16:34.49]Oh, Jerma!
[16:35.15]I saw that so close.
[16:36.60]So, so close.
[16:38.16]But it was technically a ramp, so it would not have counted as a stair stab.
[16:43.02]Oh, come on.
[16:44.29]No, no, no.
[16:46.93]Can we get an official on this?
[16:49.63]Stair stab is just a term.
[16:51.16]It's not a stair.
[16:52.78]It doesn't have to be a stair.
[16:54.60]Alright, I guess we'll defer to Stabby.
[16:56.78]I'm going to have to agree with Star.
[17:00.34]Alright, alright.
[17:01.17]I'm sorry, Kip.
[17:01.79]I'm sorry.
[17:02.25]Regardless, he didn't get it.
[17:03.25]Let's just go back to that point.
[17:04.89]He did not get it.
[17:05.51]The point is, he didn't get it.
[17:08.64]Alright, get your camera ready.
[17:12.75]No!
[17:12.87]I just want to be constantly on your cam and shit-talk you.
[17:15.23]Can I do that?
[17:19.88]I'm going to make it happen.
[17:23.31]Baylor rocking the Huntsman got a nice headshot right there.
[17:26.84]As all Huntsman headshots are nice, right?
[17:29.72]I think I've gotten five times better with the Huntsman.
[17:32.99]I just got ambushed.
[17:36.05]On the Jerma cam.
[17:37.59]We got Chris Huntsman going on.
[17:40.36]Get your camera ready.
[17:41.64]He's crouching by some leaves.
[17:43.36]Get your camera ready.
[17:44.42]You might as well get your cameras ready.
[17:49.21]I think they might see you crouch walking.
[17:52.86]Might as well just get the camera ready.
[17:55.10]My cam has not been unready.
[17:56.99]The camera's so ready.
[17:59.27]That demo's taunting.
[18:00.08]You gotta get this.
[18:01.10]He's gonna... He was gonna go up those stairs.
[18:04.61]I know.
[18:05.03]It's just gonna be impossible.
[18:06.49]Everyone's watching the stream.
[18:09.58]Okay.
[18:09.70]Okay.
[18:13.01]I'm gonna get this.
[18:13.93]I'm gonna get this.
[18:16.17]What is the bet?
[18:16.93]Again, how much does Star pay for this?
[18:18.66]$5,000.
[18:19.48]$5,000?
[18:19.82]What a man, Star.
[18:22.82]You're just... Star loves the kids.
[18:25.51]Let's just repeat that.
[18:26.47]I said $1,000.
[18:27.05]$1,000.
[18:28.11]$3,000?
[18:29.82]Wow.
[18:31.90]I'm gonna buy the kids a Ferrari.
[18:35.08]It's for the kids.
[18:36.71]And don't forget, this hour before 8 p.m.
[18:38.75]Eastern Time, if you donate a minimum $5, you'll be eligible for a strange Australian ambassador signed by Stabby.
[18:45.92]That's gold.
[18:46.90]That is one of the more precious metals, if I'm not correct.
[18:49.88]Oh, come on.
[18:50.24]This guy's clearly watching the stream.
[18:54.10]The person who provides the servers is watching the stream.
[18:57.74]I just saw him, like, just see me invisible and started shooting at me.
[19:02.17]Shout out to Tragic for, of course, providing these lovely, lovely servers.
[19:06.13]And over on that point, also shout out to Azil who provided the $400 for which we bought our merchandise with, the mechanical keyboards.
[19:13.50]And also shout out to Twitch John who provided us with those Twitch t-shirts, which are also in the raffle.
[19:20.05]So shout out to everybody.
[19:21.03]who's provided us with those awesome donations that are allowed us to sponsor this for you.
[19:26.64]I'll tell you what, while we're on the topic of shoutouts, shoutout to Kurt's mom, because she made us this amazing, fantastic feast of delicious food to keep us energized and in good spirits, and I tell you, it is working.
[19:39.22]So, shoutout to Mama Truck Truck.
[19:41.38]Is it or is it not on fire?
[19:45.17]Kurt's mom, if you guys don't know, Lang, Kurt, that's Truck Truck, our cameraman,
[19:49.40]And Mailer are all in the same house right now.
[19:51.74]They're giving you the production side of it.
[19:53.50]And apparently eating some delicious meals from Mama Kurt.
[19:57.27]So shout out to her.
[19:58.85]I believe the term for that is bro sleepover.
[20:02.01]I'm not a noob.
[20:02.45]It's a gamer house.
[20:04.04]Sleepover, I'm pretty sure.
[20:05.14]I'm not a noob.
[20:07.40]You can keep saying that, Star, but... He was just chasing me with the flamethrower.
[20:11.04]Please do.
[20:14.53]Also, we got front-paged on Twitch, so I'm guessing Twitch John had something to do with that, too.
[20:19.67]So, huge, huge shout-out and thanks for that, because we haven't dropped behind below 7,000 viewers for a bit.
[20:27.60]And we're still there, so... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[20:32.91]So definitely subscribe to this channel, which is active once a year.
[20:37.88]Camera's ready.
[20:39.54]Oh, boy.
[20:41.09]are you actually got seven he's just did I think that's for some reason I was like apple but that area down right now there's a good time to do that it's chemistry at a curiosity to know how many hours on site you have hundreds hundreds but that is that the second hundreds of those are one hundred and two thousand seventy f two well it's like the game hasn't changed at all since then
[21:09.37]Spy animation, backstab animation is drastically changed!
[21:13.78]That used to be so good!
[21:16.38]You can give up, I mean... No, I'm not giving up.
[21:22.71]Was anybody actually playing this game?
[21:24.27]That, when the spy knife had, like, the different spy stab?
[21:27.42]Stabby Stabby was born in this game.
[21:29.40]You know what I'm talking about.
[21:31.34]That was a big change.
[21:33.75]Congratulations on, like, a year of spy play.
[21:37.45]It's over that I'm afraid, but... Well, I'm a little late, but you know, like, congratulations nonetheless.
[21:43.67]Thank you very much.
[21:45.10]Yeah, I've got hundreds of seconds.
[21:47.66]Wait, how many hours are in a year?
[21:51.74]Ah, no, I have... What's 5,000 in days?
[21:57.81]Lots.
[22:00.83]And there you have it.
[22:02.03]Lots.
[22:02.91]Lots.
[22:03.81]Math, ladies and gentlemen.
[22:04.77]I don't remember math major.
[22:09.95]I'm reading the chat.
[22:12.45]I'm reading the chat.
[22:13.15]Oh, you're still on me?
[22:14.34]Oh, okay.
[22:15.42]You haven't gotten it yet?
[22:17.56]I, like, donated in the time.
[22:19.84]Leave me alone, Melo.
[22:20.84]Leave me alone.
[22:22.15]No.
[22:22.81]We just got a hundred dollar donation.
[22:24.99]Jerma's over here.
[22:25.79]I gotta keep going for Jerma, who's in the same spot camping the same stair constantly.
[22:32.17]Let the man get his $150 in.
[22:34.26]$100 from Riku Yin saying, always a great thing to see us gamers band together to help charities.
[22:40.06]Anyone that has ever said games don't mean anything or a waste of time should really see the good that is done among the community for those charities.
[22:46.37]Games get such bad press and it's an easy target for violent individuals.
[22:52.40]Yet here we are using that evil for such good.
[22:54.92]Well done.
[22:55.62]Thank you, sir, for the $100.
[22:57.68]Wow.
[22:58.36]How nicely put.
[23:00.05]That was long, yeah.
[23:00.63]I had to, like, scroll.
[23:01.41]That was really nice.
[23:03.33]Yeah, definitely true.
[23:05.29]By the way, I'd say we're getting a lot of donations for $5, which is great for you guys trying to win the things that you've been talking about.
[23:13.23]As if people wanted the Gunslinger signed by me.
[23:16.45]I guess that's what they're all after.
[23:17.75]Yeah, I'm getting, where's Kip's signature?
[23:19.79]What's going on?
[23:20.40]I'm getting a lot of star love, and they want Star to do all sorts of weird stuff, so Star, I don't know.
[23:25.97]I don't know, man.
[23:28.18]Define you!
[23:29.86]Would you like me to read the first book of Ice and Fire or whatever?
[23:34.87]Can we do Fifty States of Gray?
[23:36.29]I think that would be a little more appropriate.
[23:38.15]The purple pizza turtle wants to know if he can hear a complete unedited video of Maela's bone zone story.
[23:46.00]I don't know.
[23:47.46]No!
[23:47.88]general out loud but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but
[24:05.32]Wow.
[24:06.93]Not bad.
[24:07.63]I gotta hear this.
[24:08.97]Sit next to this guy.
[24:10.59]Can we have a tip of the hat?
[24:13.02]Can we have a tip of the hat after hours?
[24:16.00]Children not invited.
[24:17.93]It's not for the kids.
[24:20.19]Not for DJ Mini Week.
[24:21.47]It's a high school kid, too, jeez.
[24:22.88]Alright, uh... $15 from... Oh my god, that's right!
[24:25.30]Now I feel dirty.
[24:26.00]...from Breaded Chicken.
[24:27.76]It says, Actually the most enjoyable stream I have ever watched.
[24:32.05]Been here all day and still enjoying the HELL out of it.
[24:34.17]Keep up the good work.
[24:34.83]Thank you, Breaded Chicken.
[24:37.08]Mmm, that sounds pretty good.
[24:38.06]Dude, Breaded Chicken would be amazing right now.
[24:40.06]You have some chicken?
[24:41.12]Get Kurt's mom on that.
[24:42.75]Get some Breaded Chicken over here.
[24:44.35]Dude, it's the best.
[24:46.95]When are we gonna get Kurt's mom on stream?
[24:54.19]She'll unbox the crate, says Kurt.
[24:56.98]In a voice only us casters can hear.
[24:58.74]He's a ghost.
[25:01.53]I'm beginning to wonder if he's alive.
[25:02.83]$20 from Serjay.
[25:04.74]Third donation.
[25:05.78]Forgot to do suggestion other times.
[25:07.62]Can Jerma and Star have a conversation like old English gentlemen?
[25:13.03]I don't might want to go down to the pub.
[25:14.73]I can't do this It was a little bit Australian it was a little bit English It's looking for is like I say
[25:36.43]Oh, good sir!
[25:38.07]That was also pretty bad.
[25:44.94]It's the thing at the zoo!
[25:49.77]The zoo thing, nothing weird.
[25:59.72]Alright, uh, should we pub the golden, uh, strange ambassador signed by Stabby?
[26:08.56]Donate minimum $5 right now until 8pm Eastern and you can be eligible to win that hot commodity, which I'm sure you could sell and, like, buy a college tuition for.
[26:17.47]also available strange Gunslinger which is also pretty sweet if you're in g main if not you can definitely use it to troll your favorite rockstar sniper I should get on my ng main I played mvm one time and all these plat teams were like you're doing pretty good in mvm we could use an ng yeah having unlimited ammo is pretty nice yeah that's exactly why you're so good at ng well I mean what were your other options there's two people that play ng
[26:49.75]I don't remember that MV.
[26:51.80]Snip, I play Engie.
[26:53.28]I saw that the Jerma, have you given up on the spy?
[26:56.05]Have you decided to leave the children in destitution and just hate people?
[27:02.22]Destitution.
[27:03.58]Destitution.
[27:04.48]Destitution.
[27:05.80]Why don't we put some more trickstabs in there?
[27:08.77]I can give you a new achievement.
[27:11.17]I can give you a whole weekend.
[27:12.53]You don't have all weekend.
[27:17.40]You have like six minutes until the end of this round.
[27:19.74]Seven minutes.
[27:21.02]Ooh, so it has a timer on it.
[27:24.18]Oh, expiring offer from Star.
[27:26.95]Jerm has to get a stair stab.
[27:30.87]If he doesn't... We all know it's going to take me like six months to get that.
[27:35.98]Well, six months from now when you get it and show it to me, I'll pat you on the back.
[27:42.78]We actually do have a legit question, I guess this is kind of, from Fire and Ice Cream, which also sounds pretty good right now.
[27:48.88]He slash she asks, how many hours do you each have in TF2?
[27:53.11]Is that like the hours that TF2 has been open, or like, you know, hours of play?
[28:02.25]I guess if you totaled all your classes together, all your class times together.
[28:07.30]Math.
[28:08.46]How many hours do you have on Spire Saber?
[28:10.55]Because no one wants to say it, it's like a little embarrassing.
[28:16.88]5200.
[28:17.16]What?
[28:17.48]I feel totally comfortable saying I have 1700 on soldiers.
[28:22.91]You only asked just to like make yourself look good.
[28:28.29]You're not even curious, you just knew it was an obscene round.
[28:32.64]I have 3,000 hours.
[28:34.41]Oh, melee with the big kill.
[28:37.45]And then he immediately crushes you.
[28:38.90]I think I have somewhere around 3,000.
[28:40.88]I don't know exactly what the numbers are, but somewhere around 3,000.
[28:43.81]Maybe a little more.
[28:45.41]I have about 2,500, but most of them are casting, so... I got about 3,000.
[28:51.34]Yeah.
[28:52.76]Yeah, I quit whenever I want, really.
[28:54.66]I mean, we're nerds, but we're not that big of nerds.
[28:57.27]Nah, we pretty much are.
[28:58.79]I'm comfortable admitting I had a depressing MG obsession.
[29:05.24]Hey man, first hit's free, kid.
[29:07.58]Yeah, at least you don't gotta buy these crates.
[29:09.74]Mission begins in 60 seconds.
[29:13.04]Now, we have another serious question coming in from Oathblivion in the chat.
[29:16.47]It's towards Stabby.
[29:17.22]He says, Stabby, what is the current state of the spy?
[29:20.77]So, talk about that.
[29:23.40]Uh...
[29:24.41]What is the current state?
[29:25.68]He's invisible at the moment?
[29:34.61]That's a rather vague question.
[29:36.38]Has it gotten harder or easier since the beginning of your Highlander?
[29:41.99]Well, I mean, no.
[29:44.83]Like, is he as effective as he used to be?
[29:47.30]No.
[29:48.72]People have learned to deal with the spy much better, I'd say, yeah.
[29:52.98]And the quality of players in Platinum just keeps getting better, too, and that's always going to make a spy's life harder.
[29:58.75]Not really.
[29:59.85]Season 5 was the peak of Highlander.
[30:02.66]What?
[30:05.10]So has the meta evolved at all?
[30:07.18]Are there any unlocks that are finding more or greater use that are changing things?
[30:12.63]Oh, definitely, yeah.
[30:13.89]The Latranger buff was a big deal.
[30:16.14]Let's just say this for an hour.
[30:26.51]Let's just have a special Letranger session here.
[30:30.11]Gaben told me it's called the Latch and Load.
[30:32.45]Okay, he says so.
[30:35.39]Letranger?
[30:36.15]That's the one that when you get a backstab you get a crit on your pistol, correct?
[30:39.16]That would be the Diamondback.
[30:41.22]Oh, so what's this one?
[30:42.56]This one just gives you 40% more cloak.
[30:44.98]passively and it does very little damage and it also gives you cloak on when you land a shot so basically it's it's kind of just like you you can run around invisible forever with invisibility watch you know it's just a huge yeah it's very cool
[31:06.81]I'm not even upset that I didn't know that, because I know for a fact Seaburr had no idea.
[31:10.48]I still don't know what you're talking about.
[31:13.12]It said words at some point.
[31:17.06]I have another question for you.
[31:19.07]What is your favorite knife besides the stock, and can you and Jerma have a spy versus spy curtain showdown?
[31:28.72]My favorite knife?
[31:29.74]Well, I probably use the Spicycle the most behind it.
[31:32.62]I don't know if that's my favorite.
[31:34.30]Is it because it's really funny when they die?
[31:36.43]Yes.
[31:37.50]Nice.
[31:41.05]Okay, that's an answer.
[31:42.31]Now, for somebody who maybe doesn't know a lot about Spy, like, I really, I played it maybe a little bit in public servers every now and then, but I don't really know much about the weapons, and especially as the Unlocks came out, I never really paid attention to them.
[31:53.23]I only ever used the, maybe the Ambassador.
[31:55.97]Can you walk me through, like, you said you like to use the stock knife the most, but behind that, the Spicycle, what are the benefits to the Spicycle or maybe some other knives out there?
[32:07.41]Well, Spice Cool puts out flames.
[32:11.74]So you get caught out by Pyro and you're cooked.
[32:14.60]You're not dead for sure.
[32:15.36]You get two seconds of immunity to flames.
[32:17.24]So that's the upside, but that's also kind of a downside.
[32:20.63]A lot of the time, you'll be right about to backstab the medic, and then the Pyro just puts you with one little particle of flame, and the medic lives, and you die, and everything's bad.
[32:32.97]So it's kind of a trade-off more than an upside or a downside.
[32:37.68]that's interesting school so I have a question for you who's who's who are watching right now and when to my left is from Gary uh... well that's not something that's up to my right is something that
[32:55.06]She's not as good.
[32:56.91]Alright, she's closer to me, so... I was hoping it was going to be... Can you see Banny with your eyes somewhere in the room?
[33:06.34]Right now?
[33:07.10]If I, like, stretch.
[33:08.64]Yeah.
[33:10.18]Lauren and Banny just came behind me and, like, ambushed me, like, made me jump out of my seat while I was all absorbed in pub gameplay here.
[33:20.09]They scared me very badly.
[33:21.65]They're a couple of pranksters.
[33:24.22]Some cheeky, cheeky folk.
[33:25.93]Oh, don't say that word, Justin.
[33:27.79]You didn't hear it.
[33:28.58]Cheeky?
[33:30.24]No, did I do it?
[33:31.40]No, no.
[33:31.82]You just started.
[33:32.71]It's like, oh, cheeky, cheeky playing ulti duo.
[33:36.54]I have a $40 donation from Jay Panda.
[33:41.55]Great job on tip of the hats too.
[33:43.05]Went over to my friend Batmander's place to watch a stream.
[33:46.26]Having a great time watching so far.
[33:47.82]Awesome.
[33:49.76]$25 from Nabjun.
[33:53.40]Says, set sail for turtle fail.
[33:56.41]I don't know what that means, but it's funny.
[33:59.61]Thank you, guys.
[34:00.47]Please vote no.
[34:02.41]Oh, wait.
[34:05.02]I voted no.
[34:06.36]I got really scared.
[34:10.28]Stabby, is there a Highlander event or something going on at the land faster speed?
[34:17.09]Alright.
[34:18.49]Pick up games.
[34:19.19]Pick up games.
[34:20.16]I'm not really sure if there's an actual tourney or anything.
[34:23.16]Alright.
[34:23.38]That's cool enough.
[34:23.88]Maybe they're just not telling me.
[34:25.44]Or maybe just TF2 stuff.
[34:26.68]In general, always good.
[34:27.56]Always good.
[34:30.12]It's pretty fun playing Spy with 0 ping, I have to tell you.
[34:33.31]How much are you dominating?
[34:36.18]How many children did you make cry today, Stabby?
[34:39.24]Cry?
[34:39.87]How many children are at the LAN?
[34:41.27]I'm giving you the kids, man.
[34:44.16]My children are maybe under 18.
[34:48.28]uh yeah here's a question if we could all add one weapon what would it be that's the question I was gonna ask you know bloodsire we just met but I feel like we have something and we're really nice ah who said that that was lt Jerry I believe said that which is a kind of cool name scout shoes that you can jump on people's head dude okay alright alright hang on it is not cool that you can wear an alligator back get shot with a sniper rifle in the head and not die I
[35:18.50]Can we just get rid of that item?
[35:19.68]Can we all agree that the alligator back needs to go?
[35:22.17]Yeah, I agree, because originally when that weapon came out, wasn't it that you couldn't equip it, or you didn't get that benefit unless you also used the sniper rifle that didn't actually headshot people?
[35:30.03]I just mean a quick scope, you know?
[35:31.57]Like, if I nail somebody for 150 damage, that guy should die, you know?
[35:36.39]run away with the help of the and that's just what we're going on that's true but even now like you can't get that benefit used to be I think they have set bonus but now I get that benefit by just having that weapons so you can you can headshot and not be headshot which I think is a double-edged sword there for which that is ridiculous I agree on that on that too I feel like if they're going to add anything I feel like they need to both the prior again
[36:02.88]We should give him like something where you can just hold down mouse one right around.
[36:10.65]Let's just get rid of mouse two.
[36:12.29]And then when he talks, he can just become like this unstoppable crit machine that you can't kill.
[36:17.58]Listen to us like old angry nerds.
[36:20.72]Like, oh, wow.
[36:22.34]I'm sick of this.
[36:23.97]I remember back in the day when a sniper could get headshot.
[36:26.93]This is outrageous.
[36:28.33]Okay, well, the true old school TF2 players remember the worst period of pub history is when they first introduced the Backburner and that thing gave you like 80 life and the pyro was like... 50 health, yeah.
[36:40.41]Running around with your own pyro was like 380.
[36:43.70]It's wrecking.
[36:43.96]Did you know that?
[36:44.74]That was before Air Blast, too.
[36:45.94]Yeah, that was before Air Blast.
[36:47.06]When that came out, I was pretty livid.
[36:50.43]Yeah, you were.
[36:51.03]I actually got banned on the forums, I think, because of this.
[36:53.70]But I was, yeah, on the actual forums, I was banned.
[36:57.51]I went on the forums, I was like, well...
[36:59.09]Okay, because also at that time, the sniper video had just come out in which there's jars of his urine being placed next to him while he's camping, right?
[37:08.25]So I'm like, well, if the pyro gets all these things and a weapon that can shoot across the map, being the flare gun, then the sniper should get a jar of his urine to throw at people, to put people out of fire.
[37:18.08]But of course.
[37:19.44]And Valve covered their tracks by banning me and deleting the thread and then they added the weapon so they didn't have to give me credit.
[37:25.67]Man, you deserve some money.
[37:28.05]That's what I'm saying.
[37:30.10]Wow.
[37:30.60]Sounds like you got roasted, bud.
[37:32.96]Roasty toasty.
[37:35.58]With some questions in chat, just real quick, I want to remind everybody that if you join in the next 20 minutes, you can be eligible for a raffle for the Strange Australian Ambassador signed by Stabby or the Strange Gunslinger.

[38:12.16]Of course, the charity, it all goes to One Step Camp, which is a charity which helps children who have cancer.
[38:19.01]It sends them to camp for the summer, allows them to have some fun in their lives.
[38:23.04]It's a great, great cause.
[38:24.82]You can get some great items out of it.
[38:26.14]Feel free.

[38:35.84]So do that.
[38:36.44]Donate.
[38:36.98]We are getting a lot of your donations in more than $5 a lot of times, so thank you so much.
[38:41.95]I'm doing my best to get comments out.
[38:44.36]You guys are leaving longer and longer comments.
[38:46.50]They are very nice, and many are touching comments.
[38:48.66]Can't really read, you know, the whole paragraph thing.
[38:50.63]Oh, I did say I was going to read Twitch John, the rest of Twitch John's weird... Oh, you won't read the touching ones?
[38:55.77]Will you read Twitch John?
[38:57.47]I love Twitch John!
[38:58.31]Touching, touching, touching.
[38:59.88]I gotta kiss the ring there, you know?
[39:01.66]Oh, boy.
[39:03.36]Seabare confers a lot.
[39:05.34]Yeah, I love my Twitch John.
[39:06.24]I mean, I was going to paste you... Actually, you know what?
[39:08.53]I'm done with Twitch John.
[39:09.49]He changed his Twitter name.
[39:11.43]He's done.
[39:12.01]He's dead to me.
[39:14.92]That was the... Nah, stop.
[39:17.05]Any touching, then?
[39:18.23]Any touching ones?
[39:19.94]No touching, alright?
[39:20.84]You can't follow him at the old Twitter handle, unfortunately.
[39:25.48]I will read donations to change the topics quickly.
[39:30.75]$25 from Mechanical Psycho Barry.
[39:32.68]This one's sort of long, so bear with me here.
[39:35.18]I want to thank my dad for letting me do this, but besides that, I do it mainly because of the kids.
[39:39.79]I never got to do stuff like this.
[39:41.51]I've never got to do fun stuff like this.
[39:42.90]I have to thank Jerma for getting me back into SFM and Star for being quackers.
[39:49.82]Get four to parents.
[40:18.13]I want to also throw a shout out to RuskyDoo, who brought the bowler hat, the iconic hat that you see all over our logos.
[40:26.35]He brought that into TF2.
[40:27.70]If you are watching on the Twitch page, you can scroll down.
[40:30.22]There's a link that'll take you to the Steam Workshop page.
[40:32.84]We have it up there.
[40:33.92]Like it, favorite it, tell your friends to do the same.
[40:36.70]We're trying to get this item into the actual game so we can get some monetary donations towards the charity that way.
[40:43.35]Definitely go ahead and like that.
[40:44.45]I am going to paste a link into chat for your convenience.
[40:48.02]And that link will be absorbed instantly.
[40:50.66]Does anyone see this sentry at last?
[40:52.44]That is awesome.
[40:53.24]That is crazy.
[40:54.96]It was built by car underscore.
[40:57.25]Who's cheating?
[40:58.62]And I like his avatar, because it's Star's old avatar, but a car instead of a star.
[41:03.14]I get it.
[41:05.33]This guy.
[41:06.05]He's devoted.
[41:08.25]Find his YouTube.
[41:08.93]He's got a telly up there and everything.
[41:10.81]Wow.
[41:11.96]Shoutout to car.
[41:13.14]We have a crit site for others.
[41:15.80]Shoutout to Vaylin making a good map.
[41:19.02]Is it really Vaylin's map?
[41:20.39]That's terrible.
[41:21.89]Look at the hills!
[41:22.93]The mountains are beautiful, guys.
[41:23.85]Let's just remember that part.
[41:25.70]It's like, what is it resting on?
[41:27.16]Like a cloud over the vent?
[41:29.51]Oh, I'm sure it is.
[41:30.57]That's... not good.
[41:32.47]It's gonna be broken.
[41:34.06]Swift Daughter has similar points like that on last, but, uh... Of course, you can also heal it with the Rescue Ranger.
[41:41.03]You can just stay in the garage and shoot at it all day, so it's exactly what he's doing.
[41:45.17]Going back to weapons that need to be implemented, I think there needs to be an NG weapon that brings ammo to you.
[41:51.64]Brings metal to you.
[41:53.04]Like a little robot?
[41:54.20]Oh, like a lasso.
[41:55.73]Like a lasso.
[41:56.65]Like a lasso on his belt.
[41:58.03]Thank you, Stabby.
[41:58.97]Thank you.
[41:59.77]You're welcome.
[42:01.56]Since we're talking about brilliant ideas, I always thought there should be, like, metal cleats for the scout.
[42:05.93]When you double jump on somebody, you do a lot of damage, you know?
[42:08.95]Yeah, but you took that from me because my idea is better than yours.
[42:11.91]I'd just like to remind everyone really quick that there is less than 15 minutes left on the current timed raffle that we have going.
[42:18.42]If you go to our website, that is tipofthehats.org slash donate, and make a donation of at least $5, you will automatically be entered into a raffle in which you can win either a strange Australian ambassador signed by none other than Stabby Stabby, or a strange Gunslinger.
[42:34.00]So that's less than 15 minutes, donate at least $5, and you will have the chance to win one of those fantastic items.
[42:39.75]And you'll also be eligible to win the regular raffle items as well on top of that.
[42:44.64]Yes, you don't have to explicitly enter this raffle.
[42:47.73]You can enter another raffle and still be entered into this timed raffle.
[42:51.88]You're just in raffles all over the place over there.
[42:53.81]We got raffles flying out everywhere.
[42:55.27]You know what?

[43:19.42]You're like the new Billy Mays slang.
[43:22.04]The Billy Mays of GF2.
[43:23.00]Should be pitching the Slap Shop next.
[43:25.46]But wait, there's more!
[43:27.37]You're gonna love my rap.
[43:30.25]I got $20 from Patty.
[43:32.01]Great cause, great stream.
[43:32.91]My dad battled with cancer and came out on top, so let's send some kids to camp and have him come out on top as well.
[43:37.72]Smiley face.
[43:38.72]Thank you.
[43:40.40]Yeah, really cool guys.
[43:41.56]$50 from Vacant.
[43:44.71]No message, but thank you very much, sir, for the $50.
[43:48.51]Meanwhile, why does Jerma hate the kids?
[43:51.70]He must have hit the kids.
[43:52.49]Why does he hate the kids?
[43:54.01]He's, uh... Where's that stair stab from, huh?
[43:58.54]I got all weekend.
[43:59.40]Oh, okay.
[44:00.67]I have plenty of time.
[44:01.97]We're making up rules now.
[44:03.57]Is this the, uh, most watched TF2 stream of all time?
[44:07.43]Like, does the stream have, has it been here before?
[44:09.50]Yes, definitely.
[44:10.04]Okay.
[44:10.76]Fantastic.
[44:11.22]Shout out to everybody who has watched.
[44:12.64]Don't know how you got here, don't really care, but make sure you subscribe to this.
[44:16.89]I care.
[44:17.09]I don't think you, you mean, you should follow.
[44:20.70]I don't think we have a sub button.
[44:22.76]Oh yeah, follow.
[44:23.25]The yearly stream sub button.
[44:24.95]And we'll go ahead and plug TeamFortress.TV, which has streams for all your favorite streamers, like who you see here, like Stabby and Star.
[44:33.12]You're a streamer, right?
[44:34.28]Sometimes.
[44:34.98]You do videos?
[44:35.96]Yeah, I do the videos.
[44:37.47]I do streams.
[44:38.09]Mayla.
[44:38.45]Mayla's the top two streamer.
[44:40.11]Yeah.
[44:41.77]Occasionally a Mayla achievement.
[44:44.69]I'm not sure which of us should be ashamed.
[44:46.61]I'm not sure which of us should be ashamed.
[44:49.24]I'm not sure which of us should be ashamed.
[44:51.92]I'm not sure which of us should be ashamed.
[44:53.36]I'm not sure which of us should be ashamed.
[44:54.50]I'm not sure which of us should be ashamed.
[44:55.49]I'm not sure which of us should be ashamed.
[44:56.43]I'm not sure which of us should be ashamed.
[44:57.59]I'm not sure which of us should be ashamed.
[45:00.79]I'm not sure which of us should be ashamed.
[45:01.85]I'm not sure which of us should be ashamed.
[45:02.82]I'm not sure which of us should be ashamed.
[45:03.90]I'm not sure which of us should be ashamed.
[45:05.06]I'm not sure which of us should be ashamed.
[45:06.32]I'm not sure which of us should be ashamed.
[45:07.42]I'm not sure which of us should be ashamed.
[45:08.52]I'm not sure which of us should be ashamed.
[45:09.46]I'm not sure which of us should be ashamed.
[45:10.56]I'm not sure which of us should be ashamed.
[45:11.47]I'm not sure which of us should be ashamed.
[45:12.47]I'm not sure
[45:13.46]That brings me back to, uh, nobody asked this, but I'm sure they're wondering it, what hat do you want to see implemented?
[45:18.85]There was a hat in, uh, Steam Community Workshop a while ago of a cat that would purr, and you would see, like, little Z's coming out of his head every now and then, the tail would move.
[45:28.66]I want that implemented more than any other weapon I have ever wanted.
[45:31.65]A cat hat.
[45:33.69]A cat hat, right?
[45:34.39]I want mounts.
[45:35.35]I want to ride a cheetah to mid.
[45:38.73]Sounds logical.
[45:40.81]I want the bowler hat that Waskidoo made.
[45:43.13]The tip of the hat's hat, you know?
[45:44.63]Get that one in there.
[45:45.90]You can use the proceeds to go to a good cause.
[45:47.60]That'd be great.
[45:48.10]So once again, guys, scroll down, click on the workshop link, like and favorite it, send it out, make sure your friends do the same.
[45:54.97]Let's show Valve, let's show the TF2 devs that we're serious about this and we want this in the game.
[46:00.02]And it is paintable.
[46:01.41]It's super cute if you paint the band, so just think about that.
[46:04.87]So kawaii.
[46:06.56]So cute.
[46:10.01]Diaper heavy, by the way.
[46:12.15]I'm heavy with a diaper.
[46:13.11]Like, come on.
[46:15.88]Like wearing a diaper?
[46:17.51]Or like on his head?
[46:18.83]No, heavy wearing a diaper like on his body.
[46:21.53]Like a giant baby diaper.
[46:23.20]I wanted to put that in.
[46:24.04]I was thinking about having that be in the workshop a long time ago.
[46:28.02]That's pretty good.
[46:28.76]Is it a clean diaper?
[46:31.75]We'll have different styles.
[46:32.83]One's like good diaper, one's like not so good, one's pampers.
[46:38.38]I guess it would appeal to the children.
[46:40.66]A diaper with a baby bonnet.
[46:42.90]I identify with that.
[46:44.49]As someone who poops their pants.
[46:48.73]I'm being a child.
[46:49.91]I'm not actually a pant pooper.
[46:52.68]The young man and lady next to you who's looking like, uh... Yeah, totally.
[47:01.31]That is correct.
[47:02.61]Well, I pooped my pants, and I may just do it right now.
[47:05.19]What do you guys think about that?
[47:06.34]Oh, oh, oh.
[47:07.47]Oh great, so we're just gonna start talking about pooping now?
[47:09.74]Like, this is what this is?
[47:10.92]No, no, no.
[47:11.40]Meanwhile, we're almost, we're about $200 away from $45,000.
[47:15.17]No!
[47:15.57]For the kids, guys.
[47:18.32]$45,000.
[47:20.76]Poopy for the kids!
[47:23.45]Oh my goodness.
[47:24.99]Okay.
[47:25.21]I have $20.
[47:26.00]Ah!
[47:27.56]From the guy sitting next to me.
[47:29.50]No, uh, from HaydenW37.
[47:31.56]While I love you both to death, I hate the fact that Star and Jerma make TF2 look so damn easy.
[47:37.49]Keep up with everything you guys are doing.
[47:41.17]Jerma's a natural-born gamer.
[47:42.94]Why do you make it look so easy?
[47:44.26]Everyone wants to talk about Jerma.
[47:46.20]Everyone wants to talk about Jerma being bad at this game.
[47:49.24]We get it.
[47:50.31]You're like an iPhone gamer.
[47:52.31]You're an icon.
[47:54.05]You're not meant for the computer.
[47:56.93]I'm an iPhone gamer.
[47:59.12]He's just not good at these types of games.
[48:01.52]Hold on a second.
[48:02.42]Hold on a second.
[48:03.04]Let me bite the tips of my fingers.
[48:04.78]Let me pull these gloves off.
[48:05.91]No, he's using an iPhone.
[48:06.99]He's using an iPad.
[48:07.87]There's a bigger screen resolution so you can click it easier.
[48:10.39]Hold on a second.
[48:11.07]I'm just nibbling on these gloves.
[48:12.83]Put the camera on me.
[48:13.58]Put the camera on me.
[48:14.40]You're going to watch this and tell me who's bad.
[48:16.34]Put the camera on me.
[48:17.78]You want to talk like that?
[48:18.82]Put that camera on me.
[48:19.92]Put that camera on me right now.
[48:21.40]Is it on me?
[48:23.54]I'm watching.
[48:23.86]I'm watching.
[48:24.45]When did Matt Damon get here?
[48:25.53]Ladies and gentlemen, I hate to interrupt, but we are officially over $45,000 raised for One Step Camp.
[48:32.40]Good job, everybody.
[48:33.42]Keep them coming.
[48:34.06]We got tons more raffles going.
[48:36.02]Lots more events coming your way.
[48:37.35]And remember, this is just day one of Tip of the Hats.
[48:39.85]We have a whole other day coming up tomorrow.
[48:42.27]So thank you, everyone, for sticking with us so far.
[48:44.52]And keep on watching.
[48:46.14]And you only have eight minutes left for the opportunity to be entered in the raffle for the Strange Australian Ambassador signed by none other than Stabby Stabby.
[48:54.51]Donate minimum $5 and you'll be eligible for that raffle.
[48:58.54]Also, Strange Gunslinger up for grabs, which I'm pretty excited about, but should be good.
[49:03.86]Only a few minutes left, so definitely get those donations in now.
[49:09.14]Coming up next, the next hour, at the 8 o'clock hour, we're going to have C-Bear and myself.
[49:13.97]We'll be bringing you the OT Duo Tournament.
[49:16.84]We're going to have some good players, some high-level players facing off.
[49:20.58]The Medic-Soldier combo versus another Medic-Soldier combo should be pretty good.
[49:25.51]I'm excited about that.
[49:26.40]I'm sure C-Bear is also, so stay tuned to that very shortly.
[49:29.69]Okay, um, $5 from Amazing wants to know, how much money do we need to raise for Star to tell the bone zones?
[49:37.92]No!
[49:38.50]No!
[49:39.28]That's nice.
[49:41.19]I mean, that's my story.
[49:42.67]It was in the Star video, but I... No amount of money.
[49:46.13]It's on the internet somewhere, so it can't be that bad.
[49:48.93]It's very... A censored version is on the internet.
[49:53.12]Oh boy.
[49:53.90]The full story has honestly been forgotten.
[49:56.84]It's too long ago.
[49:57.84]It was like in October.
[49:59.12]And it was lost to history.
[50:00.59]Don't worry about the bone song.
[50:01.59]Wow, the anals of history.
[50:03.51]The anals.
[50:03.95]The anals of history, boy.
[50:06.37]I get it.
[50:07.50]I don't know what I expected, but... Alright, I thought the eight-year-old was gone, but apparently he's... The love is through with the blood and kill.
[50:22.34]$10 from BruceFootstar is my favorite and Valve must release Diaper Heavy at 12.01am New Year's Day.
[50:30.04]Hashtag baby New Year heavy.
[50:32.49]Oh, that's a cute.
[50:33.69]That's a good idea.
[50:34.81]So kawaii.
[50:35.77]But, hey, what does a hashtag mean?
[50:38.19]It's like the Twitter, it's a Twitter thing.
[50:40.51]You have the Twitter, you have the Twitter.
[50:42.60]Why do you do the tweets with the hashtags?
[50:45.68]I don't know, why do you live on a boat?
[50:47.48]That's a very good question.
[50:50.41]But my boat doesn't have a hashtag.
[50:53.05]Maybe I need one.
[50:55.78]It's so you can search for trends.
[50:58.60]He does.
[50:59.56]Hashtag daddy's boat.
[51:01.97]Hashtag boat party.
[51:02.91]You live on a boat?
[51:03.95]Really?
[51:06.29]That's how we knew each other, Meila.
[51:08.71]No, I'm just like, huh.
[51:12.04]Wait, you're telling me... You live on a boat.
[51:17.10]You live on a mobile aquatic vehicle.
[51:19.73]What's the name of the boat?
[51:20.77]Fantastic.
[51:21.75]What's the name of the boat?
[51:24.36]Oh, that's a secret.
[51:25.32]I'm not telling you.
[51:26.58]Are you afraid of stalkers?
[51:27.68]Yes.
[51:30.89]Yes.
[51:32.31]Probably true.
[51:32.81]Fair enough!
[51:34.43]Can we see your boat from this Upwork map?
[51:35.99]Cause there's a boat, isn't there?
[51:37.13]I think it's the Santa Maria.
[51:37.95]Is there really?
[51:38.81]It's a big, uh, steamer.
[51:40.38]Do you have a big steamer boat?
[51:42.64]Steamer.
[51:43.30]Oh crap, I'm gonna get headshot.
[51:44.42]When was the last time we dropped a big steamer?
[51:48.33]Oh my goodness.
[51:49.27]Oh poopy, but again!
[51:52.09]So guys, can we return to talking about diapers?
[51:55.07]This has kind of devolved into...
[51:57.10]Let's turn back to five minutes left.
[51:59.56]Five minutes left in the raffle for the Strange Australian Ambassador designed by Savvy Stabby.
[52:04.29]Donate minimum $5 and it could be yours.
[52:06.99]You'll be the talk of all the Skyle pubs if you ring that about.
[52:11.40]I'm not sure if that's a roast.
[52:12.82]Can we get a confirm from Truck Truck?
[52:14.41]Is that a roast?
[52:16.20]Hey!
[52:17.96]Little Roasty Toasty, baby!
[52:19.95]Little Roasty Toasty!
[52:22.79]Yeah, it's getting a little too disgusting, so let's read another donation here.
[52:27.48]$5 from Clacky who says, If you poop less or two or less... Oh, that's way better!
[52:35.21]You probably need more fiber in your diet.
[52:38.35]Thank you, Clacky!
[52:40.54]That's a good help for everyone in general.
[52:42.74]Also for the kids.
[52:43.88]More fiber.
[52:46.88]I gotta say that you guys and gals are getting a little bit weird with the donation comments.
[52:51.67]I'm still loving it.
[52:52.45]I'm laughing hysterically over here.
[52:54.47]I can't read most of them, though.
[52:57.57]And some of them are just really touching and sad.
[52:59.54]I feel like, you know, oh, let me interrupt this poop story and talk about someone's, you know, horrible series of cancer.
[53:05.41]Please, please.
[53:06.21]That's what you're here for.

[53:20.02]No.
[53:21.14]Stabby's a little bit established though.
[53:24.54]That's why he's retired.
