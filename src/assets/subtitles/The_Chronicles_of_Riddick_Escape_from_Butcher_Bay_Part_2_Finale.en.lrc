[00:01.91]Hadn't even been 10 sec, people are already punching me.
[00:04.41]Did you see that?
[00:05.01]I turn the stream on, I just see Gedim and people punching.
[00:10.86]How you doing guys?
[00:13.14]Welcome back.
[00:15.62]Welcome to part two of the Chronicles of Riddick Escape from Butcher's Bay.
[00:24.91]This is a two-part series.
[00:27.33]I plan on finishing this tonight.
[00:28.66]I think we're fairly close to... Somebody said I'm more than halfway through the game.
[00:35.74]Probably like 60% of the way through the game.
[00:37.78]Probably have another three or four hours.
[00:39.36]Freddy Dredd coming in.
[00:42.75]With 50 community subs.
[00:44.27]He just throws rocks full of money.
[00:50.00]He just throws eggs filled with money, not egg yolk, at the stream.
[00:53.84]It's a lot.
[00:55.08]Freddy, you continue to fucking... Freddy... Freddy sometimes comes to Vegas.
[01:02.43]Like, Freddy, if we go out somewhere... If, like, we hang out if you come to Vegas eventually... Like, I... Don't... You ain't buying shit, okay?
[01:17.67]And I'll tell you this.
[01:19.52]I will take you to Denny's and you can get anything you want on the Denny's menu.
[01:23.82]I promise you that.
[01:26.30]At least twice.
[01:27.24]We'll go to Denny's twice and you can get anything on the whole menu.
[01:33.94]He's already paid for it all.
[01:35.86]He already paid for it all a hundred times.
[01:39.06]He could probably own the franchise of this Denny's that I'm talking about.
[01:49.07]No, but seriously, dude.
[01:51.43]You've gone above and beyond what anyone would ever be expected to give a single person on the internet any amount of money.
[01:58.65]Like times a million.
[02:02.53]Oh, thanks.
[02:03.39]And if you ever come to Vegas, that offer stands.
[02:12.04]I shaved my head.
[02:12.92]Alright, well, it's hot out.
[02:15.70]That's not a bad idea.
[02:18.08]Get him.
[02:23.35]Uh, Grove Coaster just gave $145.
[02:24.93]Not for Freddy to be... $145 in bits.
[02:34.72]What are you doing?
[02:36.40]That's a lot of money.
[02:37.58]That's too much money.
[02:39.56]And they said, I defended my master thesis 15 minutes ago.
[02:43.50]Thanks for being here.
[02:45.78]Like a debate?
[02:46.76]Holy shit, that's a lot of money.
[02:49.42]Thank you.
[02:52.81]Did I change my microphone?
[02:54.45]No, I sound weird.
[02:56.71]I shouldn't unless I fucked something up.
[02:59.44]The microphone is closer to my mouth.
[03:00.90]So, I mean, do I sound like I'm too close to you?
[03:06.38]Do I sound like I'm way too close to you?
[03:07.72]Should I back up a little?
[03:14.96]Did you get the standing desk?
[03:16.22]No, I didn't.
[03:18.00]I did not.
[03:20.40]Here's my problem with the standing desk.
[03:23.25]So last year or like a year and a half ago, I got this really nice.
[03:27.87]You've seen it.
[03:29.35]My like nice walnut desk.
[03:33.09]And this thing was kind of expensive and I want to use it.
[03:36.29]But it just sucks where it's like, oh, well, shit.
[03:41.27]What do I do with this?
[03:42.01]What can I put this somewhere else?
[03:43.11]I have to get like a whole new desk now.
[03:49.58]Get it as a second desk.
[03:53.41]So the idea is me and Kim were talking about it and I'm probably going to move this one out in a space where she could kind of use it as a little like area where she can do some work and stuff.
[04:05.55]So that's probably the plan.
[04:06.44]And I'm going to get a standing desk.
[04:10.98]You don't need a standing desk.
[04:11.96]Just get up occasionally.
[04:13.18]Yeah, but you know me.
[04:15.29]I'm not gonna do that.
[04:16.35]I'm gonna be sitting here just fucking screaming at a 2004, like, 10-year-old video game.
[04:21.17]I'm not gonna remember to, like, stand up every 15 minutes.
[04:24.45]And I don't wanna, like, just have that in the back of my mind.
[04:28.12]Stand up every 20 minutes.
[04:29.16]Stand up every 20 minutes.
[04:29.92]I won't.
[04:30.18]It's just gonna fuck me up.
[04:31.50]So I might as well just stand the whole time.
[04:35.70]2004 was 16 years ago.
[04:36.88]I don't even want to say these things.
[04:40.84]I know.
[04:41.12]Alright.
[04:44.91]Does anybody here feel like that every year has been like 2015?
[04:48.93]Like it's just 2013 every year, right?
[04:51.05]I just feel like it's 2013.
[04:51.99]We have not gone past it.
[05:04.13]The world is passing me by, and I'm just in 2013.
[05:09.99]Like, I just uploaded, like, Jerma Rumble 3.
[05:13.33]No, that was fucking seven years ago.
[05:17.97]That's so much time.
[05:27.66]That's how, that's so much time has passed in seven years.
[05:33.08]What have I been doing?
[05:34.70]Okay, let me ask you this.
[05:36.12]Have I done anything in seven years?
[05:38.26]I think I have.
[05:38.86]I feel like I've done a lot of things.
[05:46.34]Yeah, I think I have, maybe.
[05:47.74]A little.
[05:48.04]I did the carnival.
[05:52.08]Well, yeah.
[05:53.88]That was cool.
[05:56.22]Oh.
[05:56.32]Yeah.
[05:56.46]Yeah.
[06:01.13]Also, this is going to be an interesting stream, because I just realized something.
[06:04.71]So I woke up a little bit tight this morning, and I, uh, I did, I took a, I took a little bit of, uh, some pain-reducing potential CBD, and this might be a CBD, uh, stream.
[06:16.80]I just want to make that very clear so people don't yell at me when I can't open the door for, like, the third time in a row.
[06:22.28]Um...
[06:24.24]I didn't want to cancel the stream because I want to obviously finish this and I want to play and I want to stream so I you know it's legal in the in the United States of Las Vegas where I am here in this in this area and I'm alright Didn't I took just a little bit so I took I take it for pain those of you that don't know Washed up drug streamer
[06:49.38]Like three milligrams of CBD and THC for pain.
[06:55.14]I do not put that in that category, okay?
[07:00.58]Anyways, we're gonna play.
[07:01.88]This is Butcher's Bay.
[07:04.04]He's got wicked low weed tolerance.
[07:11.24]By the way, why is that a bad thing?
[07:16.02]You do realize that being able to, like, feel better and feel good at, like, three to four milligrams?
[07:25.28]I know some people that, like, are, like, they're, like, fucking doing, like, 20, 15, and they've built up such a tolerance.
[07:33.18]That's an expensive tolerance.
[07:34.52]Low tolerance, inexpensive is what you meant to say.
[07:41.16]Remember, the gateway from CBD is to CBT.
[07:44.90]Read that one out loud.
[07:46.74]Good.
[07:47.74]Pick that one to read.
[07:52.31]It's only been eight minutes.
[07:56.78]Joe Rogan.
[07:58.40]No, I... Alright, I shouldn't have even said anything.
[08:01.78]But it's almost like I have to, like, preliminarily defend myself when I, like, make a bunch of mistakes in the game.
[08:08.15]But, like, that doesn't matter because I do that anyways.
[08:10.39]So it's just going to be a regular-ass Jeremy stream, right?
[08:14.37]Like, I'm not going to be able to remember where the door is.
[08:16.27]And I'm trying to, like, give, like, a thing to blame.
[08:19.17]So, like, you know that now.
[08:20.32]So you can blame that.
[08:22.06]But I did that yesterday.
[08:23.10]Okay.
[08:27.18]Alright, let's go.
[08:28.26]You ready?
[08:29.88]Right where we left off.
[08:32.77]We had this dude here.
[08:34.77]We had to go get a bomb for this guy.
[08:37.33]And just in case somebody missed it yesterday, I'll show you.
[08:39.57]I'll just welcome... I'll show you.
[08:41.53]No, I'm not going to do that.
[08:42.47]I was going to punch him in the face.
[08:44.09]I'm going to punch him in the face.
[08:44.93]Just so the new audience can tell.
[08:46.85]Like you can do that.
[08:47.39]Okay.
[08:47.49]Okay.
[08:52.88]How do I turn on?
[08:53.32]Alright.
[08:53.50]So those of you that are wondering about this game, um... You can see in the dark.
[08:58.78]Although seeing in the dark just looks like you're looking through a really expensive vase.
[09:04.23]So... Like, I have a piece of quartz up to my eye.
[09:09.07]Alright.
[09:09.77]I have to go back, right?
[09:10.85]Let me see.
[09:16.38]He wants me to go get bomb.
[09:18.58]Go to tower 19 and get a bomb.
[09:21.49]To get to tower 19, head back from the mining core up to the mine entrance, then use Jagger's code to activate the elevator.
[09:27.63]Alright, we have to go back to that original elevator.
[09:35.46]I almost pressed that.
[09:36.16]What do I have?
[09:38.42]Oh yeah, I have weapons.
[09:42.56]Don't adjust your monitor.
[09:43.78]Do not adjust your screen.
[09:45.54]You're probably messing with the tent and shit.
[09:47.18]Don't do that.
[09:47.76]The game is very ugly.
[09:49.96]I promise it's not your screen.
[09:51.48]It's mine.
[09:51.88]Wait, yes.
[09:56.12]Yes.
[09:57.10]No.
[09:58.74]Yes.
[10:01.36]I was fucking with the tent, Dad.
[10:03.70]I just told you not to do that.
[10:08.09]It's not your screen.
[10:09.07]It's mine.
[10:16.21]The game's kind of loud.
[10:19.63]I'm going to turn the game down.
[10:21.86]Fix my screen.
[10:31.98]Oh, no.
[10:32.70]You're making a joke.
[10:33.46]Okay.
[10:36.47]Alright.
[10:36.97]I've got to go back up.
[10:37.71]We've got to go in the elevator.
[10:38.49]We've got to get the bomb from Tower... I remember Tower 19.
[10:40.51]It's in the... Oops.
[10:46.24]Why does it look like sewer sludge is covering the screen?
[10:49.38]Because this game is very, very, very ugly.
[10:53.76]Now, I didn't say this is a bad game.
[10:57.57]This game is actually pretty fun.
[11:00.03]But it's incredibly ugly.
[11:08.17]It's not ugly at all, to be honest.
[11:11.47]Well, you'll see.
[11:14.12]This is only like a third of the game, is walking around with lights on.
[11:18.54]Most of the game looks like this.
[11:19.78]Oh, we got two clubs here.
[11:38.14]Wrong way.
[11:38.72]I think he's high.
[11:39.78]Stop.
[11:40.12]Why did I even say that?
[11:41.32]And by the way, for those of you that are saying, why is he like use this little like fucking black and decker nail gun?
[11:49.17]No, I can't pick up.
[11:51.75]I can't pick up weapons.
[11:53.01]I'm unauthorized.
[11:54.67]Everyone was very, very upset about that last time.
[11:57.45]Alright.
[11:57.65]I need to get out to the main area, which is... Am I going the right way?
[12:11.21]Is this the right way?
[12:15.13]Yeah, this is right, right?
[12:17.97]Missed a rat.
[12:18.71]Get the rat.
[12:19.53]You missed the rat.
[12:20.67]Was there a rat on the ground?
[12:28.90]Where's the rat?
[12:33.52]Rat list?
[12:35.26]Where is it?
[12:41.19]Are you... Was it on the ground?
[12:44.37]Oh!
[12:44.76]Okay, there it is.
[12:45.46]List of rats.
[12:46.10]Alright, I got it.
[12:48.90]I thought you were talking about, like, there was a rat on the ground.
[12:55.96]It's like, you missed the rats.
[12:56.86]You missed the rats.
[12:57.46]Like, I thought, like, oh, there's, like, a rat on the ground.
[12:59.05]Alright, let's move.
[13:00.21]I just have to make my way back to the elevator.
[13:08.22]Which, who knows where that is.
[13:10.75]It's been more than 24 hours.
[13:12.47]It's gone from my mind.
[13:17.47]Just jump?
[13:18.09]Oh, yeah.
[13:18.37]There's no fall damage.
[13:19.27]You're right.
[13:19.65]Can I use this?
[13:23.60]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[13:25.30]Do I want to go in here, though?
[13:27.34]Where is this going to take me?
[13:33.18]Well, this is going to take me back up.
[13:35.60]Or down.
[13:45.44]It's going to take you back up.
[13:46.60]That's what I want, right?
[13:53.24]Try it out, yeah.
[13:59.40]Don't press the red button.
[14:08.08]Of course they would make a game where you have to backtrack again.
[14:10.76]Oh, no, no, no.
[14:11.78]This is it.
[14:12.10]This is it.
[14:12.44]No, it's not.
[14:16.82]This is not it.
[14:18.90]This is not it.
[14:26.27]I just went down.
[14:27.21]Somebody said I was going to go up and then I went down.
[14:29.55]Alright.
[14:31.87]Hey, welcome to the stream.
[14:32.77]Let's go.
[14:33.43]Here we go again.
[14:33.99]Let's go up.
[14:49.17]Okay, so what what's the actual way to go?
[15:01.38]Oh?
[15:03.14]God damn it.
[15:03.86]Are you telling me that I just could have walked through this?
[15:06.52]So I went this way No, I didn't wait Upper minds yeah, this is where I went.
[15:17.52]This is where I want to be
[15:20.89]I hate backtracking.
[15:21.99]I'm so glad it was deleted from every video game.
[15:23.97]Alright, so right or left, though?
[15:34.22]How do I get back to where I want to go?
[15:50.83]Yeah, he's on DMT.
[15:53.97]No, this way.
[15:56.56]Imagine trying to stream on DMT.
[15:59.54]That would be impossible.
[16:04.72]If somebody could do that, I have no fucking way.
[16:11.29]Not a chance in hell.
[16:17.92]Where the hell do I even want to go, though?
[16:19.36]Like, I'm trying to just get back to the beginning.
[16:22.78]This is a safe point.
[16:34.52]Okay.
[16:38.68]I gotta sneak through here.
[16:46.93]He's done it.
[16:47.93]Did I though?
[16:48.97]Like, I have no idea where the fuck I am.
[16:59.01]Find those boxes.
[17:01.57]This is just bringing me back this way.
[17:10.44]From here?
[17:15.51]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[17:16.53]This is to security checkpoint.
[17:18.41]I'm going the right way.
[17:27.38]Game is now very, very quiet.
[17:28.92]Okay, I got you.
[17:37.24]Why is this so... This is new.
[17:38.46]I haven't seen this.
[17:46.15]oh my god this is the this is the beginning this is the beginning okay I found it just check your map well the problem with the map is it literally just looks I don't even know where I am I don't know which one of these rooms I'm in I made it this is the beginning I just don't die
[18:16.65]There's no fucking way I'm going to be able to get through this.
[18:19.84]Not a chance.
[18:20.44]I'm not going to be able to.
[18:21.44]Can I electrocute him?
[18:22.30]Can I like lure him out here and push him into the electricity?
[18:26.24]You shouldn't have eaten a BLT.
[18:27.78]Where's the light?
[18:34.26]Turn it off.
[18:38.65]You've had too much mayonnaise on that BLT, dude.
[18:41.75]Alright.
[18:46.72]Now you're in my world.
[19:10.01]Does he have to be?
[19:12.01]I'm never gonna be able to get by this guy.
[19:18.99]He's just standing in the doorway.
[19:20.89]I don't think I'm gonna be able to do this.
[19:36.75]I might as well just run.
[19:37.87]I think I'm gonna have to just run.
[19:47.23]Use the bat?
[19:51.02]This doesn't work.
[19:51.56]I already did this.
[19:52.85]Alright, ready?
[19:54.01]1, 2, 3, GO!
[20:03.80]I can't say anything!
[20:23.58]Now that's what we call a... Okay.
[20:28.95]This is what I need to do, right?
[20:32.51]What?
[20:34.35]I just got a new code.
[20:35.85]Oh, fuck this.
[20:36.91]I'm out.
[20:37.75]I'm done.
[20:46.89]We actually just take this back.
[20:49.35]Alright, here we go.
[20:53.19]Get the rifle.
[20:53.85]You can't pick up rifles.
[20:54.89]You can't pick up rifles.
[20:56.03]Yeah, I tried to tape this.
[20:59.13]It doesn't matter.
[21:00.89]I ripped the tape off in rage.
[21:02.84]It didn't work.
[21:05.78]Alright.
[21:06.94]Perfect.
[21:07.54]Now we're just going to go back to tower 19.
[21:13.54]Why is all this activated?
[21:14.48]Can this open?
[21:21.11]This is all messed up.
[21:31.09]I just broke my chair.
[21:35.42]I'm sorry to hear that.
[21:39.22]What's the point of this vent?
[21:47.39]Wait, why can I even open this?
[21:56.87]Oh, it's the cigarettes.
[21:57.85]Alright, well, hold on.
[21:59.17]Should I jump up here and climb?
[22:06.34]Get those ciggy butts.
[22:12.68]What the hell am I doing?
[22:20.88]I feel like I'm cheating right now alright where am I cargo transport I need to go back to like tower 17 and like the feed ward where the am I security checkpoint I climb and like hang I guess this is not gonna why am I doing this
[22:55.18]What am I doing this for?

[23:07.11]Can I break?
[23:07.47]Should I break?
[23:08.05]That door's not gonna open.
[23:10.49]That door doesn't open.
[23:11.33]I think I have to break the glass and go in.
[23:17.54]Ah!
[23:28.81]Stealth kill?
[23:29.51]I don't, I can't, I don't think you can.
[23:36.30]I'm right up his ass.
[23:37.44]If he moves, he's gonna know I'm here.
[23:44.08]Wait.
[23:46.62]Is this motherfucker even active?
[23:51.30]Holy shit!
[23:51.98]I thought he was inactive.
[23:52.84]I thought, he didn't do anything.
[23:54.11]Dude, I thought he was inactive.
[23:55.21]I thought he was inactive.
[23:56.15]I was bumping into him and stuff.
[23:57.25]I thought he was not activated.
[24:02.59]I thought he was not moving around and shit.
[24:04.66]Okay, so what the fuck?
[24:08.70]So that's not the way to go?
[24:14.50]So I need to go back down here.
[24:15.94]Where the fuck am I going?
[24:24.54]I have to go and like climb into the vents and shit, don't I?
[24:33.63]This is the wrong way.
[24:34.61]How am I getting a cutscene?
[24:45.79]Wait, hold on.
[24:49.99]Hold on.
[24:51.79]Do I just need to...
[25:07.53]Give me the lights.
[25:08.21]Turn the lights on.
[25:08.81]And then we go backwards, right?
[25:21.18]Yeah?
[25:28.82]No, we don't go backwards here?
[25:37.06]Stop using the club Well, that's not my main concern my main concern is what's the one stupid way to go back and go back back tracking backtracking backtrack
[26:09.20]I have to go beyond the bridge?
[26:13.40]Stop the co- I'm just gonna watch a fucking YouTube video on how to get back here.
[26:16.00]Hold on.
[26:24.89]That's cheating.
[26:27.17]That's fine.
[26:44.45]He's doing the- He needs a video guide.
[26:46.55]Why would you have it, like, climb through- I don't- I don't- I- I'm not even- Look, I'm not even gonna- What do you want me to say?
[26:53.90]I'm not even gonna say what you think I'm gonna say.
[26:55.20]Alright, I've made it to another fucking gray room.
[27:10.60]Alright, now it's up-
[27:17.01]Do I go up here and then all the way around?
[27:19.29]This is the mines again.
[27:35.58]You need to go back to the elevator.
[27:38.26]The elevator just took me to a place where I couldn't go.
[27:40.24]Is this shit it?
[27:43.80]Did I make it?
[27:54.22]Dude, you took the whole bottle.
[27:56.91]This is it, right?
[27:57.95]No!
[27:58.45]Because this just brings me... Wait, what?
[28:01.75]This is the fan, which then brings you back to the original area, which then... This is a mess.
[28:17.77]Don't turn the service panel back on, dude!
[28:26.95]Okay, so... This is the beginning, so I should be able just to go in that elevator and take me down!
[28:34.07]I remember this shit.
[28:43.36]You remember this?
[28:44.12]This is the very beginning.
[28:48.32]This is how I got down here in the first place.
[28:51.94]Remember?
[28:52.36]I was like, oh, I can't do this yet.
[28:53.58]Why is this elevator not the way out?
[29:00.27]This is how we came in.
[29:06.63]Take this elevator.
[29:07.71]Didn't I try that already and it took me to a weird fucked up place?
[29:11.23]Go- no, go up the ladder in this elevator.
[29:23.13]So wait, this is a- this is a different- Are you- wait!
[29:26.23]This is the same thing- you're fucking with me!
[29:28.27]We're in the same spot!
[29:35.68]Use the elevator?
[29:36.74]Didn't I do that already?
[29:38.32]And it took me up to that weird spot where the guy was blocking the door?
[29:41.41]Use the elevator first and then go up the vent.
[29:46.69]Why?
[29:47.29]Why?
[29:48.12]Why can't I just leave?
[29:49.76]Why can't I just leave?
[30:02.73]He's never going to find the cheese.
[30:04.19]Why can't I just leave?
[30:08.27]Okay, so take elevator up.
[30:09.51]Don't go out elevator door.
[30:10.51]Go up elevator fucking ladder into the dark vents.
[30:12.57]Go through vents up.
[30:13.64]There's two different vents, by the way.
[30:14.94]There's two elevators with two different vents.
[30:18.12]They both look the same.
[30:24.40]What the fuck is this?
[30:26.22]What is this like being John Malkovich hole that I have to find?
[30:30.76]Which, by the way, that's a pretty good movie if you haven't seen it.
[30:33.06]Alright, we found it.
[30:42.33]We did it.
[30:42.79]Alright, good.
[30:44.25]Now I can finally just turn off the... Wait, no I didn't.
[30:54.85]Did I find it?
[30:58.22]This is it.
[30:58.90]Oh, healing station.
[30:59.76]Oh, that's it.
[31:00.22]I don't want to do the vent thing again.
[31:03.15]Oh, my God.
[31:07.81]I don't want to do the vent thing again.
[31:11.45]Hey, by the way, guys, we hadn't even hit yet.
[31:13.91]I just wanted to make that's going to be very clear.
[31:24.26]Are we up or are we down?
[31:25.36]Where are we?
[31:25.80]We're up.
[31:32.72]It's gonna.
[31:33.00]Oh it's gonna get worse from here.
[31:34.08]No it's not.
[31:34.52]Cause we're not gonna have to do any more like vent climbing.
[31:39.68]You'll know when.
[31:40.54]You'll know.
[31:41.30]Because I'm just gonna go.
[31:42.12]Hey.
[31:45.10]I have to go that way.
[31:46.26]I have to go over here.
[31:52.36]Right now you hear me.
[31:53.20]This is.
[31:53.58]This is.
[31:54.14]I'm completely with it.
[31:56.83]Well maybe not completely.
[31:58.41]But as with it as I am without being on any type of substances.
[32:04.71]He ate the whole.
[32:05.27]He took the whole.
[32:05.89]He ate the whole brownie.
[32:09.79]It's going to be.
[32:10.25]That was what we call a little.
[32:14.72]Oh, I thought I could.
[32:17.96]Never mind.
[32:18.26]Alright.
[32:18.74]Give me the health.
[32:21.68]He ate the whole plate.
[32:33.84]How do you eat a whole plate of brownies in a regular circumstance?
[32:37.38]That's what I want to know.
[32:40.56]Oh wow, he ate the whole plate!
[32:42.06]No, why would you eat a whole plate of brownies normally?
[32:44.50]If this happens again, I'm gonna eat the batteries that are in it.
[32:48.26]I hope that doesn't happen again.
[32:51.50]I feel like if I ate more than two brownies... My- It would be like cement in my stomach.
[33:09.72]Did I fuck something up?
[33:12.15]Why, why can I not do this?
[33:13.33]What's going on?
[33:14.83]Oh, thank God, it's another vent.
[33:16.35]Wait, there's two vents now.
[33:19.41]There are three vents.
[33:21.43]What's the right vent?
[33:22.65]Oh, I can't even go in that one.
[33:31.59]Is this, am I doing this right?
[33:39.80]I really hope I never have to do this again.
[33:42.72]Because this sucks.
[33:44.34]I don't want to be in vents.
[33:56.77]I don't want to just do vents while I be in a dark room and then immediately go to a light room.
[34:07.51]The whole day.
[34:15.60]I don't think I've even been here.
[34:17.38]Oh, cigarettes!
[34:23.24]What is this?
[34:23.82]Can I climb that?
[34:37.07]I don't know.
[34:48.63]It's just like on DMT.
[34:51.95]Oh shit, the lights are so bright.
[34:53.55]Turn the lights up.
[34:56.79]Where am I?
[35:04.38]No, don't make any jokes.
[35:05.14]I don't want to lose.
[35:13.86]I'm sorry dude, I'm on fucking DMT!
[35:17.09]I don't even know who you are!
[35:19.43]Is this thing alive?
[35:39.92]That thing's gonna come out and attack me, isn't it?
[35:44.04]Am I going crazy?
[35:44.94]Was I just supposed to go back to Tower 19?
[35:46.28]What is all this shit?
[35:51.93]Was I not supposed to kill him?
[35:54.71]Wait, do I need a screwdriver?
[36:00.16]Maybe I- was it an NPC?
[36:01.84]Did I ruin everything?
[36:07.62]What's over here?
[36:09.50]Oh, I can go down there.
[36:10.34]This is where... This is where I was before.
[36:18.63]Did I miss something?
[36:22.32]I didn't softlock the game, right?
[36:24.08]No.
[36:33.20]No, I didn't.
[36:36.83]Hold on.
[36:37.13]Wait, did I DMT lock the game?
[36:41.76]I hope that's not the running thing we continue to reference this stream.
[36:46.92]I'm sure it will be, but I don't want it to be that.
[36:49.88]What's this?
[37:00.18]No, there's nothing down here.
[37:01.50]I have to do something with that robot in there.
[37:21.60]Whatever.
[37:22.82]No doors or anything.
[37:26.48]Guys.
[37:30.18]Uh.
[37:31.46]I think I may have soft locked myself.
[37:42.69]No.
[37:43.51]There's Salada.
[37:50.53]Is it alive?
[37:51.87]What?
[37:53.77]Hold on, what?
[37:54.27]I get to be in the suit?
[38:02.67]Oh shit!
[38:08.38]I don't know where I am!
[38:13.46]How many balls do I have?
[38:16.74]Wait, why can I walk through walls?
[38:28.74]I had the thing on.
[38:30.06]I had the thing on.
[38:32.74]But this doesn't help me.
[38:34.06]This just makes me more dangerous.
[38:35.36]I still don't know where to go.
[38:44.72]Oh, I'm opening the doors with my little T-Rex hands.
[38:49.15]I'm going to the briefing room.
[39:00.72]Alright, nice work.
[39:07.46]Okay, okay, I don't... Is he dead?
[39:22.29]Wait, can I get in his... I want to get into his suit.
[39:31.99]Wait, why are there two?
[39:34.13]There were two?
[39:34.69]How are there two of them?
[39:38.75]Oh no, look at him.
[39:40.23]He's sad.
[39:40.99]Look at what he did.
[39:42.35]He made me kill two of my brethren.
[39:55.17]Monstrosities.
[39:58.77]I never want to be in this place again.
[40:02.81]Jerry, take me from here once and for all.
[40:08.92]Okay, man.
[40:09.80]Let's get out of here.
[40:12.80]Jerry, if you could please give me some of that DMT.
[40:21.29]Oh, you want some DMT, dude?
[40:22.37]Alright, you got it.
[40:24.63]I'll take some right now.
[40:26.87]Right now?
[40:27.23]Yes.
[40:31.94]Hold on, man.
[40:32.62]I'm not sure you're ready for this.
[40:40.48]I am ready.
[40:41.20]Alright, man.
[40:42.08]Here you go.
[40:43.70]I'm going to give it to you right now.
[40:46.00]I'll lift your tongue up.
[40:54.55]Holy shit.
[40:56.89]Holy shit.
[40:59.11]I just beat a machine alien.
[41:05.15]I think the clerk at my local Walmart is actually Jesus Reborn.
[41:26.38]And here are 200 reasons why.
[41:31.61]Hey, whoa, man, whoa, man, you gotta settle down on the DMT.
[41:38.08]Oh.
[41:40.72]That was wonderful.
[41:43.22]Thank you for that experience.
[41:45.67]Yeah, man.
[41:46.23]I don't really want to do DMT.
[41:47.99]You just hit me up any time of the week.
[41:57.22]Get out of here.
[42:09.05]Get out!
[42:10.57]Okay, I need to get out of the robot to see.
[42:17.04]Anybody know where I'm going?
[42:22.46]Read the screen.
[42:29.07]It's just matrix glitter.
[42:31.41]I can't read that.
[42:38.65]Did I just go back the other way?
[42:56.82]Oh, no.
[42:57.48]Shit.
[42:57.98]Somebody just said this guy is dumb.
[42:59.80]Fuck.
[43:00.26]No, dude.
[43:00.70]I'm not.
[43:01.72]I'll get it.
[43:02.10]Don't leave.
[43:03.67]Just hold on.
[43:23.55]Alright, I got rid of the noise.
[43:28.57]Wait, that wasn't... That was a big problem for me, but that wasn't the actual problem.
[43:43.94]Can't go through any of these.
[43:50.02]Maybe I'm really just not supposed to go this way, unless is there a vent?
[43:55.17]Wait.
[43:56.57]I have to... No!
[43:57.87]I have to leave DMT Robot?
[43:59.63]No, I don't.
[44:00.03]He can get up here.
[44:17.62]Oh, no.
[44:20.98]That's too bad.
[44:27.45]Oh, that's it.
[44:34.82]Well, see you later, DMT robot.
[44:36.52]It's been a lot of fun.
[44:41.74]Thank you, Jerry.
[44:44.28]You have given me more experiences than I could possibly ask for in a human.
[44:51.73]Have a wonderful rest of your game.
[44:55.17]Powering down.
[45:00.36]Bye.
[45:01.38]Bye.
[45:01.72]It was nice to meet you.
[45:03.00]Bye.
[45:03.32]Turn off the filter.
[45:15.33]Where'd he go?
[45:15.79]Oh!
[45:37.71]The real DMT was the friends we made along the way.
[45:40.68]This elevator sucks, why is it not moving?
[45:46.52]It's cause it's not an elevator.
[45:54.22]Shit.
[45:56.00]Oh, wait a minute!
[45:58.80]Alright, DMT robot, power on!
[46:08.77]We're gonna have a bunch more fun, man!
[46:12.37]We're gonna take DMT!
[46:13.52]We're gonna do all this fun shit!
[46:15.78]No!
[46:32.71]Oh, no.
[46:33.39]That's... That's the origin story for DMT Robot becoming a villain.
[46:37.91]Why am I climbing this?
[46:41.71]Why would he do that?
[46:42.69]I didn't do that.
[46:46.06]I'm trying to... I didn't climb that.
[46:52.14]I wanted just to walk down here.
[46:53.42]Okay.
[47:06.73]It's hard to aim at the guy when I try.
[47:09.63]It's very, very difficult.
[47:11.97]It's a difficult experience.
[47:13.43]It's a difficult game.
[47:14.55]It's hard.
[47:15.13]It's a difficult game.
[47:28.42]What?
[47:29.26]Why is he shooting at me?
[47:30.84]No!
[47:31.24]DMT robot!
[47:31.94]What are you doing?
[47:34.00]Oh, that was another robot.
[47:36.18]What the fuck happened here?
[47:44.81]What the fuck happened here?
[47:50.59]Oh, no.
[47:54.59]Okay.
[47:55.35]Alright.
[47:56.61]How do I get you to move?
[47:59.01]Oh, no.
[48:05.73]Oh no, it's CVT robot.
[48:08.73]No, that can't be who that canonically is in this universe.
[48:11.90]I'm sorry.
[48:15.96]Just get in.
[48:26.76]Let's go.
[48:27.62]I already died before I could do the joke part of what I was going to do.
[48:34.10]It is too bad that one of my friends had to perish.
[48:39.86]What happened?
[48:40.40]What happened to the audio?
[48:49.33]Did I fuck it up?
[48:55.88]Alright, well, that's where that arc ends.
[48:58.66]I was gonna do a thing where this was gonna be his dad, mad that he was taking DMT.
[49:03.66]He was gonna be like, I'm adventuring, dad!
[49:05.63]Leave me alone!
[49:06.23]And they're gonna be like, big fight, and it's like, his dad dies.
[49:08.25]Is that because they're fighting?
[49:09.69]You know, I was gonna do that whole thing.
[49:13.11]Just pretend I did that.
[49:14.26]Alright, that was fun.
[49:31.12]I did not expect that I was actually going to get into one of these though.
[49:35.12]The whole game they tease you about how scary they are.
[49:37.33]It's going to be really sad when he actually dies.
[49:51.60]I'm out of his aggro range.
[49:55.76]It's fine.
[50:04.23]grenade oh no he's gonna die is there a healing thing I can do these people are friendly these people are not friendly okay okay that's it someone's sitting in the flamingos
[50:35.29]That guy took a lot of hits.
[50:38.01]Flamingos?
[50:38.75]Yeah, what does that mean?
[50:48.75]Oh no, he's dead.
[50:55.87]I feel like this is what the dinosaur fossils of an AT-ST would look like.
[51:00.05]He's dead.
[51:00.39]Does it mean I'm dead?
[51:20.67]I gotta be careful here.
[51:21.51]I'm out of health.
[51:28.47]Prepare the robot.
[51:30.27]I don't know how to do that.
[51:42.01]No, you can't.
[51:42.80]I have the screwdriver out.
[51:44.84]It doesn't work.
[51:45.34]I just have to not take any hits.
[51:51.66]It's kind of hard to do that though.
[52:03.77]It's regenerating health?
[52:06.79]Is it?
[52:08.28]Okay, they expected me to walk through immediately and I didn't.
[52:10.66]They blew everything up.
[52:19.74]Stand still.
[52:20.50]I'm going to stand still after this and see if I heal.
[52:34.33]OK, here we go.
[52:35.17]Ready?
[52:37.75]Shut it off.
[52:42.02]Yep.
[52:46.60]I don't think that works.
[52:49.45]I think we have to ditch.
[52:50.73]Somebody said R2 DMT2.
[52:53.68]I think that's too.
[52:54.20]I don't know about that.
[52:55.38]I'm not sure I'm going to sign off on that one.
[52:58.16]No, there's no.
[53:05.82]I just have to not die to the flamingos.
[53:09.88]That was my joke.
[53:15.62]As I said, somebody said that.
[53:18.59]Okay, this is important.
[53:29.44]Holy shit.
[53:33.78]God, he's dying!
[53:35.96]I'm sorry, I gotta get out.
[53:37.62]Get out!
[53:37.98]Get out!
[53:38.26]Get out!
[53:43.17]Show yourself!
[53:54.57]No!
[53:55.17]Wait, I'm just looking at... They're killing him.
[53:58.53]I'm stuck in here.
[54:12.68]I'm actually stuck in here.
[54:13.56]I can't move.
[54:14.78]How did I get in here?
[54:22.58]Wait.
[54:25.27]Pack of smokes.
[54:25.95]Can I keep going up?
[54:35.14]How the hell am I going to do this without the robot?
[54:38.76]What about up there?
[54:44.62]Ow!
[54:46.85]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
[54:51.45]I could have shot the lights.
[54:53.19]Fuck, you're right.
[54:54.35]Oh, I'm so stupid.
[55:03.27]I'm not fucking around anymore.
[55:04.05]Let's go.
[55:13.64]Yeah, that's right.
[55:14.32]I took the... I got the last punch.
[55:20.77]It did not mean to exit.
[55:32.39]Send in the flamingos.
[55:34.50]Did it?
[55:49.53]This dude says ow when he gets hit in a video game.
[55:51.85]LOL.
[55:52.23]Yeah.
[55:53.33]I have the Nintendo Power Magazine order form.
[55:56.85]I ordered the fucking vest thing that vibrates when you take damage in a game.
[56:04.20]You don't play games with those?
[56:09.18]Okay, fine, dude.
[56:10.14]So you're not like a real... You kind of use a controller and you don't put your body in it?
[56:14.68]Okay.
[56:15.10]Okay.
[56:16.60]now that's that's like cool though I feel like the game that way the lamp um apparently is has can take 5 000 rounds
[56:46.60]Industrial lamp.
[56:59.47]Play DOOM music.
[57:01.47]Sure.
[57:01.74]I was supposed to scream a guitar riff, but that's embarrassing.
[57:10.06]So I'm not gonna do it.
[57:10.72]Okay.
[57:23.76]Send in the flamingos I can't kill them though Here's the deal Lights out Where I need every light gun
[58:12.70]I have to get rid of the ones on the right, jump out of the robot, and take out the other one.
[58:19.91]I don't want to do that.
[58:20.79]How do you avoid damage when two mechs are firing machine guns at each other?
[58:36.86]Not that one.
[58:37.40]That guy was an idiot.
[59:00.31]Come on out!
[59:15.30]I've got two bars of health two bars of health flights why is it the what okay here's the plan
[59:48.84]Oh man, what are they doing over here?
[59:51.21]Oh shit.
[59:54.87]Oh shit!
[59:55.43]Get in!
[59:55.89]Get in!
[60:11.30]He's dropping his fake accent.
[60:12.94]What am I doing?
[60:14.08]Oh, this sucks.
[60:17.03]Do what I did last time.
[60:18.09]Yeah, I just gotta, I gotta try to kick.
[60:22.29]I really might have to go back and have full health again.
[60:26.69]Let them walk to the explosion.
[60:28.51]I did that last time, but it didn't kill them.
[60:33.53]O-kick?
[60:34.59]It's alright.
[60:36.19]I'm gonna try.
[60:39.38]Just shoot them.
[60:40.94]I thought I was doing last, like two times before that.
[60:44.63]Shoot the flamingos.
[60:45.95]Do an impression of a monkey.
[60:47.94]There you go.
[60:54.72]And I demand... I demand attention from you now.
[61:10.32]I forgot about these three.
[61:15.82]Okay.
[61:16.90]I'm ready.
[61:17.76]I'm ready.
[61:18.16]I'm ready.
[61:19.40]Wait till they get to the explosives and then blow it up.
[61:24.78]That's the plan.
[61:25.36]That's what I'm going to do.
[61:26.20]No!
[61:42.47]No!
[61:58.69]It almost worked.
[62:01.25]Is there?
[62:01.83]No way.
[62:02.21]Can I heal him?
[62:02.93]Wait a minute.
[62:03.45]Can the robot?
[62:04.31]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[62:05.15]This is important.
[62:06.67]What about the heal boxes that have the key?
[62:09.81]That's a heal, right?
[62:10.75]No, what is that?
[62:11.35]I don't know.
[62:12.27]Never mind.
[62:13.71]I thought that was a heal.
[62:34.14]I figured that maybe the huge, they could pick up the boxes and use them.
[62:42.63]Stun gun can repair DMT buff.
[62:59.68]Alright, time that person off for five minutes.
[63:14.28]No, don't do it.
[63:17.66]Don't do it.
[63:18.38]No, don't do it.
[63:20.16]Please, don't do it.
[63:20.78]Wait, where did the guy that's over there go?
[63:25.37]Did he dock an explosion?
[63:30.67]That's a first if he's dead from the explosion.
[63:34.61]Okay, come on.
[63:36.13]Come on.
[63:48.99]Gotta get me over there.
[63:50.75]Alright, just get over there, just get over there so I can jump!

[64:58.49]This light can't be destroyed.
[65:00.53]I'm not missing.
[65:01.25]This is not bad aim.
[65:17.70]What are you talking about?
[65:18.44]It's right.

[68:04.26]Wow.
[68:05.80]You typically sound like this.
[68:07.12]Hey, yeah, guys, today we're gonna play.
[68:08.70]Not today.
[68:10.56]Hey, the grenade gets him every time.
[68:12.79]You know what?
[68:13.17]I saw that comment.
[68:14.15]I didn't reply to it.
[68:15.83]I saw somebody say, the grenade fucking gets him every time.
[68:18.95]And I'm like, no, no, fuck.
[68:20.51]I'm not even gonna listen to that guy.
[68:26.25]Just might as well die right now.
[68:31.61]Okay, that's it.
[68:32.43]Someone send in the flamingo.
[68:33.93]Why is there a grenade?
[68:40.19]Someone send in the flamingos.
[68:43.28]For God's sakes, I wonder if they're going to be able to do their job.
[68:50.26]Oh.
[69:03.70]You know what?
[69:05.54]I got something for you.
[69:24.06]God damn it.
[69:25.06]Somebody send in the Flamingos.
[69:28.28]Ladies and gentlemen, your Butcher's Bay Flamingos.
[69:38.40]Here they come.
[69:40.14]He got away with a fucking grenade again.
[70:06.53]Okay.
[70:31.49]Hey!
[70:35.55]Flamingo handy.
[70:36.58]Stop it!
[71:02.20]I'm not gonna hit by the fucking grenade this time.
[71:05.10]Alright, if I can hit by the grenade, I'm giving 50 community subs if I can hit by the next grenade.
[71:20.08]I promise.
[71:35.59]The fuck is shooting me?
[71:40.93]Who the hell are you?
[71:46.72]Did I get him?
[71:49.78]What?
[71:57.09]Did he shoot himself in the head?
[71:59.95]He shot himself.
[72:01.89]What the fuck?
[72:10.14]Why?
[72:11.66]Oh, okay.
[72:12.55]Don't laugh.
[72:13.35]The grenade's still here.
[72:41.06]I think he threw it!
[72:41.84]I think he just threw it!
[72:53.83]What's the alarm going off?
[72:55.99]It was a fake.
[73:00.89]Get me out!
[73:01.81]Get me out!
[73:41.60]Hold on.
[74:06.73]I don't think it's avoidable.
[74:08.59]I think you have to get hit by that grenade.
[74:15.38]I have to get out of the suit and tase that guy.
[74:24.89]Distraction!
[74:45.08]Get up there and duck!
[75:18.92]Is it him?
[75:19.84]Is it my arch nepotism?
[75:29.87]He was aiming the gun down at me.
[75:37.55]Oh, I'm going to lose my mind.
[75:39.31]I'm going to fucking lose my mind.
[75:42.21]What is this checkpoint?
[75:45.05]What the hell happened?
[75:48.07]I just blacked out and opened my eyes and there was a dead guy and a robot in front of me.
[76:05.98]I got a different strategy this time.
[76:19.37]This guy's so shit-faced.
[76:21.43]I can't even fucking do this.
[76:26.11]You gotta go this way.
[76:32.15]Get up on it!
[76:41.59]Shoot the lights?
[76:42.35]I can't.
[76:43.31]I- guys.
[76:44.65]I'm gonna get it right in the center.
[76:46.13]I- look!
[76:49.15]See the decal?
[76:49.99]I'm trying.
[76:51.55]Trust me.
[76:52.11]I already did it.
[76:52.67]Okay.
[77:04.70]Okay.
[77:07.12]Where is he?
[77:07.74]Where are you?
[77:09.48]Oh, smart ass.
[77:11.52]I didn't hit him.
[77:13.12]Oh, he's a smart ass.
[77:14.20]I'm going to get this smart ass.
[77:20.21]He's hiding.
[77:35.28]He's not looking.
[77:35.80]He's not looking.
[77:36.24]He's not looking.
[77:38.06]He's not looking.
[77:42.38]I did it!
[78:02.64]There was no reason to do that.
[78:10.08]Uh.
[78:16.21]Well.
[78:20.47]Are they gonna see me do this?
[78:21.57]I have to get rid of the lights, but I can't even destroy that light.
[78:32.21]Okay, we're going in darkness.
[78:42.90]Quiet.
[78:43.30]There's another guy over here, right?
[78:59.73]I actually made it.
[79:04.71]I actually did it.
[79:12.08]I thought that just hit MonkaS.
[79:25.79]Alright, let's go.
[79:26.77]Tower number 19.
[79:35.61]I'm going to go in this vent.
[79:50.45]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode one of Ventcraft.
[80:17.54]Lights off.
[80:20.70]Lights out.
[80:28.48]Too bright.
[80:33.12]Lights off.
[80:36.46]Me.
[80:39.86]Why did I say me out loud?
[80:42.72]That was the mistake.
[80:46.89]I have to step on him.
[81:06.66]What's in here?
[81:08.90]Locker 18.
[81:09.34]Tower 19.
[81:09.50]That's it.
[81:10.02]I think we're going.
[81:18.70]Wait, what did that just want me to do?
[81:20.94]I got a prompt.
[81:21.52]What was that prompt?
[81:50.96]Omega lull back to the beginning.
[81:52.66]No, we're not back at the damn beginning.
[81:55.18]We're not back at the damn beginning.
[81:58.25]Who's in range?
[82:01.73]Oh.
[82:02.73]Wait.
[82:04.07]Guys, this is the prison.
[82:05.95]I get it.
[82:24.83]I do not see that.
[82:25.57]He must be pretty stupid.
[82:33.01]Hey.
[82:40.72]Hey.
[82:42.02]No, don't do that.
[82:51.64]You are a scumbag.
[82:56.27]Console aiming.
[82:59.11]But you either go too far to the left or too far to the right.
[83:02.98]You don't want to actually... You don't aim where you actually want to aim.
[83:06.44]I'm so glad.
[83:18.01]Will you stop breathing and leaning forward?
[83:32.47]I mean, I think you would sit here and just, when the lights are on, you know you can't be seen.
[83:36.37]Wouldn't you cup your mouth and yell towards the other hallway that you came from?
[83:42.83]Like, be in the corner and, like, cup your mouth and point your, like, kind of whole mouth sideways to block out the... and just be like... Go that way!
[83:58.94]Wouldn't they... it would light up the whole, um, entire hallway.
[84:08.44]That was a bad noise?
[84:14.90]Was it?
[84:16.68]Oh, because the robot filter is still on.
[84:19.88]I'm sorry.
[84:20.42]The robot filter was still on.
[84:23.14]I thought it was off.
[84:27.18]That doesn't sound right.
[84:31.36]Oops.
[84:32.85]Sorry.
[84:33.33]I'm sorry.
[84:38.93]Okay, I thought that was a guy for a second.
[84:47.52]Shit.
[84:48.88]Uh... Okay, we're good.
[84:52.12]Open cont- Wait, open the prison doors?
[84:57.50]Oh, you can't ever open the cell doors.
[85:00.60]I better be ready.
[85:10.88]Was it the platinum Chuck E. Cheese membership card?
[85:18.15]Yeah, man.
[85:21.19]Okay.
[85:50.77]Hey, you.
[86:02.51]Wait, hold on.
[86:04.33]No, no, no.
[86:05.03]You know what I find most uncomfortable about you, Riddick?
[86:11.55]How comfortable you are.
[86:13.71]Here, in Butcher Bay, I mean.
[86:17.46]Alright, I wasn't expecting Vin Diesel.
[86:19.24]And I got Vin Diesel.
[86:20.53]Vin Diesel sound...
[86:47.39]Why?
[86:47.89]What?
[86:48.87]Was he supposed to do that?
[86:51.39]Is that scripted?
[86:53.24]Because, um, what the hell?
[86:56.46]That was not cool, man.
[86:58.92]I can't even turn these lights off.
[87:05.16]Okay.
[87:07.30]Anyways, what I was going to say is Vin Diesel's voice is so low that he sounds like... You know when any demon character is on screen?
[87:16.48]They always speak like this.
[87:18.90]Whenever they... I want to hear a demon talk in a normal speaking voice.
[87:22.94]It's Vin Diesel.
[87:25.00]That's how they would actually sound.
[87:27.71]Every single demon on Earth just is always yelling loudly.
[87:34.47]Why do they make them do that in games?
[87:37.05]The only way that you can tell that I'm powerful is if I fucking scream every piece of my...
[87:50.85]Just have Vin Diesel say what I just said in a normal speaking voice.
[87:54.79]So this is scripted.
[87:57.99]Thanos doesn't yell, but he's not a big demon with a big axe.
[88:22.09]Oh, I killed him in one punch!
[88:26.44]Holy shit, I killed him in one punch!
[88:29.72]Oh no!
[88:30.82]Oh!
[88:32.16]Real voice!
[88:36.82]That was brutal.
[88:38.29]But what the hell is going on?
[88:40.21]Okay, you're telling me that from both angles here... From both angles.
[88:50.58]Is there a vent?
[88:52.45]It's gotta be the toilet.
[88:58.89]Jump off at the right time.
[89:05.36]Oh, like, onto that.
[89:07.76]Guys, I don't think I'm gonna be able to get that.
[89:18.52]I gotta count.
[89:19.92]I have to count.
[89:20.40]It's the only way I'm gonna be able to do this reliably.
[89:23.16]Okay.
[89:23.96]It's... Here it is.
[89:26.50]So it's down.
[89:27.26]Let's go now.
[89:28.70]Right?
[89:35.37]I got killed by the blade.
[89:37.15]What?
[89:51.49]You know what I find most uncomfortable about you, Riddick?
[89:57.92]I played the hand that was... Not a bad philosophy.
[90:00.26]This is for you.
[90:11.04]Alright, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[90:12.12]Wait till, okay, I have to wait till it goes up.
[90:14.04]Watch that light on the left.
[90:15.88]One, two.
[90:18.06]What?
[90:18.26]That went very fast.
[90:19.68]What?
[90:25.08]Wait, I'm going, am I going down or am I going up?
[90:28.97]I'm not supposed to ride like the great glass elevator like in Willy Wonka?
[90:33.01]I thought that's what this was.
[90:46.34]So hold on, why did I not get the cutscene before?
[90:48.54]Oh.
[91:13.78]I stood up, which didn't kill me.
[91:20.96]I just scraped the top of my head across the 200 feet of cement.
[91:32.35]When that train falls in, it's down to my bottom jaw, scraped down.
[91:38.98]Get up!
[91:39.66]What did you say?
[91:41.04]Listen?
[91:43.04]No, no thanks.
[91:43.80]I don't feel like it.
[92:16.02]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[92:17.62]Fucking more vent.
[92:29.05]I can't explode those?
[92:35.65]This is his patrol, by the way.
[92:36.76]I want to make this really, really clear to everybody.
[92:38.34]I want everyone to see this.
[92:40.10]This is this guy's patrol.
[92:43.26]You ready?
[92:43.54]A guy with a machine gun is here.
[93:01.33]Done.
[93:03.31]Who am I talking to?
[93:04.23]Um, you?
[93:10.72]Collect, like, a bunch of... What do you mean?
[93:12.76]What?
[93:26.77]Who are you talking to?
[93:30.57]That didn't do anything, though.
[93:31.37]I have to, like, release this.
[93:32.87]How do I release this?
[93:33.59]Is there a button down there?
[93:34.47]Something I can do down there?
[93:46.74]Actually blind.
[93:47.60]Is it?
[93:48.68]It was another ladder.
[93:49.62]Oh, fuck.
[93:52.98]Hold on.
[94:11.88]OMG there is a gun on the floor old man I'm not an old man You kind of old no, I'm not kind of old is like 45 Like I would say 48 is kind of old 50 is old
[94:42.43]40's kind of old.
[94:43.43]30 is... Whoa, looking good.
[94:46.89]20 is... Oh, yeah.
[94:51.88]And then anything below that, you know, is... How could I do this?
[95:08.47]Is there a crate I can jump up?
[95:14.38]There's a third ladder.
[95:15.96]Omega lul.
[95:17.06]I... No, those aren't ladders.
[95:22.73]They look like it from here.
[95:24.25]Yeah, I can agree with you.
[95:35.35]Wait, go back down.
[95:39.83]Oh, Omega S. Omega S.
[95:45.89]Oh look, another ladder!
[95:47.57]Let's go!
[95:48.25]Can I drag him down?
[96:02.71]No, this game's not that advanced.
[96:15.69]Okay.
[96:15.95]Can we get these bugs away from me?
[96:19.87]Hey, prisoner!
[96:24.62]Come on, show yourself!
[96:28.44]Asshole!
[96:33.22]Alright, I'm good.
[96:37.57]Unauthorized.
[96:45.83]I got up and did a running haymaker and missed.
[96:51.75]All he had to do was shoot me in the back.
[96:58.68]Can't take the gun.
[97:10.81]Up or down?
[97:15.42]I thought it was like gas.
[97:18.18]Wait, should I go up first?
[97:41.67]What's in here?
[97:52.94]Who's this?
[97:53.88]But it's saying he noticed the grate fall?
[98:00.84]I can't- I couldn't fit out the- I couldn't fit out the vent.
[98:18.25]Something's going on here.
[98:20.03]And I'm taking a look.
[98:30.70]Code incorrect.
[98:31.08]Please enter correct code.
[98:32.34]I'm just like a fucking wild animal, man.
[98:41.50]Something is not looking good.
[98:43.68]I think I'm going to take a look.
[98:46.22]Code incorrect.
[98:47.90]I don't know any of the codes.
[98:51.57]Uh-oh.
[98:52.47]What's that?
[98:53.69]A ladder.
[98:58.11]Vents and ladders.
[99:02.01]Don't- Hey!
[99:02.93]Don't go in the vents!
[99:03.91]You'll go all the way back to the beginning!
[99:06.31]Climb a ladder up, you'll progress ten fucking minutes.
[99:09.45]Alright, there's a button.
[99:33.85]Rail defense activated.
[99:35.55]That was an alarm.
[99:40.89]Rail defense deactivated.
[99:46.39]I can't give up.
[99:47.07]You killed me.
[99:47.73]Fuck you.
[99:48.82]Okay, I have one...
[99:57.77]Oh, what are they called?
[99:59.59]Ah, I wasn't quick enough to make the joke.
[100:02.11]Oh, that hurts.
[100:03.35]It stings when that happens.
[100:05.11]Uh, the little tabs that come in the- the little tabs you put in your tongue so your breath smells better.
[100:18.68]Like, the Listerine tabs.
[100:19.94]There it is.
[100:20.50]I have one Listerine tab left.
[100:22.32]You know what I was trying to say.
[100:23.46]It's gonna- it would've been funny.
[100:37.00]Not funny.
[100:37.66]Step it up.
[100:45.28]You know, I could go over there.
[100:47.40]Maybe I shouldn't go in the grate yet.
[100:49.76]I just... Oh.
[101:04.49]You want to have quick reaction times?
[101:06.11]I can have those too.
[101:06.97]No, turn it off.
[101:08.35]Turn it off.
[101:09.49]It's off.
[101:09.79]Okay.
[101:10.01]That was a random worker.
[101:19.33]That was way helpful.
[101:54.61]So what is this?
[101:58.45]Rail track computer.
[102:05.68]Alright.
[102:06.34]Did I do that wrong?
[102:21.50]What?
[102:21.74]It's cause the alarm wasn't on?
[102:42.22]Where do I go then?
[102:44.22]Wait, what's this thing?
[102:45.66]Wait, where's this taking me?
[103:05.72]Oh.
[103:06.88]Um.
[103:08.32]Okay.
[103:11.44]Who's bumming behind me?
[103:12.30]I didn't notice shit.
[103:23.71]For all this guy knows, I could have been like a broom.
[103:36.24]And he just shot at it.
[103:40.41]What is that thing?
[103:43.67]What is that thing?
[103:44.43]I think I heard something over there.
[103:51.11]The second that anything goes in that guy's peripheral, all these enemies... The second they see anything, it just immediately holds the trigger down.
[103:59.65]At whatever it is.
[104:04.03]This could be the pizza delivery guy.
[104:05.51]Like, what are you doing?
[104:06.53]Like, at least see who it is.
[104:07.53]I'm telling the pizza delivery guy, dude.
[104:18.94]Relax.
[104:30.08]What is... Stand up!
[104:31.14]Why am I so small?
[104:32.14]Die, shithead!
[104:37.10]Oh my god!
[104:38.24]Don't die to this guy!
[104:41.95]Why stand up?
[104:48.23]Son of a gun.
[104:54.54]Oh, son of a gun.
[104:55.94]What?
[105:02.98]I hate- I hate- No, don't say it!
[105:17.83]The camera?
[105:25.87]I know what it was, I'm kidding!
[105:28.07]I just knew I was dead because I walked over the stupid line.
[105:44.88]What is he even doing here?
[105:59.97]Doesn't usually go... I think I heard something over there.
[106:19.57]Stop dying on purpose for more donations.
[106:21.73]There's a vent up there.
[106:50.66]You're going in the vent, you think?
[107:01.25]Yeah?
[107:01.51]Alright, I gotta destroy this.
[107:07.02]I know I'll run into it later.
[107:07.94]Alright, let's go in the vent.
[107:20.21]I think this guy has below average IQ.
[107:22.83]No, I don't.
[107:25.47]I don't.
[107:28.78]I'm incredibly fucking smart.
[107:32.98]My mother told me every day just how smart I was.
[107:42.40]She was like, you're so smart.
[107:43.36]I'm just gonna give you smart boost.
[107:46.37]I'm like, oh, cool, smart boosting, and she would do my homework with me.
[107:50.46]I'd be sitting at the table, and I would be stuck on a very difficult question, you know, like, six times twelve and shit.
[108:03.11]I'd be like, mom, I need a smart boost!
[108:05.29]She'd be like, and she'd fly in, with a little cape on, smart booster to the rescue!
[108:12.47]And then when I graduated college, I didn't think I really needed it anymore.
[108:25.32]Just skipped a bunch of shit.
[108:33.22]How many guys are down there?
[108:34.34]Alright.
[108:34.75]No, no, no.
[108:35.43]Jump down and kill.
[108:36.19]I just broke my ankle.
[108:38.89]That was a shattered leg.
[109:09.99]What the fuck?
[109:14.85]No.
[109:17.78]Turn the backup generator.
[109:20.12]Go find me a new car.
[109:21.56]Go find me a generator.
[109:22.82]Go find me this.
[109:23.70]Go find me that.
[109:24.60]Go take care of that.
[109:26.38]Oh, thank God.
[109:28.31]Mom came in with a smart booster.
[109:48.65]Where's the other light?
[109:49.83]I don't know.
[110:08.27]I need to be able to see through walls so I can see where the things are.
[110:21.57]She gave you a placebo to make you feel better about your learning difficulties.
[110:26.24]What do you mean placebo?
[110:27.82]She wasn't walking in the door with like pills in her hand.
[110:43.53]She didn't go, oh here are smart boosters and then like hand me like three pills.
[111:01.89]Wait, what do you mean whippets?
[111:04.79]What are you talking about?
[111:07.22]Like, wait, you're saying that my mother did whippets and then like flew into the room with a cape on, like being like the smart booster.
[111:14.35]What the fuck?
[111:34.34]I can't.
[111:34.84]I honestly, like, I can't even, like, address that.
[111:37.30]That's too fucking outrageous for me to think about my mother doing that.
[111:44.13]Oh, somebody said dream.
[111:45.09]Thank God you said it.
[111:45.95]I had a dream.
[111:46.55]I had a dream last night that was very strange.
[111:49.37]It involves all of you.
[111:50.31]I had a dream last night that I was sleeping in bed.
[111:58.02]I was asleep.
[111:58.84]All the lights were off.
[112:01.10]And I got out of bed.
[112:02.60]This is probably around 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning.
[112:04.44]Like, I actually got out of bed to go to the bathroom.
[112:09.31]But I was dreaming at the same time.
[112:11.31]It was really weird.
[112:13.17]Like, I, in my dream, went up to go to the bathroom.
[112:16.21]But I know that I woke up and I went to the bathroom.
[112:19.19]That's what I was doing.
[112:21.84]So... I went to go into the... I went to pee into the toilet.
[112:26.44]And I saw a chat saying...
[112:29.66]Just like clockwork!
[112:30.80]Just like clockwork!
[112:31.88]There he is, right on time, right on time!
[112:34.20]Like, you- I sleep on stream, and at 1am, like, it's a thing that I get up and pee every time, I guess?
[112:41.66]Oh, here it is, like, it's 1am, it's just like clockwork, like, omega LOL!
[112:49.65]That's the whole dream, and then I went back to sleep.
[112:51.17]Alright, where's the generator?
[113:04.17]I don't touch these.
[113:09.23]And this was a very, very popular stream too.
[113:13.11]It was, there were tens of thousands of people here.
[113:17.53]Like I was the sleeping on stream guy and everybody at 1 a.m.
[113:21.21]It was like a thing that there were like emotes and shit about it.
[113:25.19]Like just like right on time.
[113:27.34]But I was just fucking sleeping and like going, I was going to bed and I didn't even acknowledge you guys were even there.
[113:34.41]What a strange life.
[113:40.82]Alright, power's back on.
[113:56.83]Now I just gotta go back up and turn that shit on.
[113:59.23]Is there a ladder here?
[114:04.60]Do I have to get grabbed by that thing?
[114:15.73]Yeah, just like clockwork.
[114:21.57]Alright, back up and then this way.
[114:28.11]How do you feel about Brain Fluid's hostile takeover of smart boosters?
[114:36.07]You know what, there really are so many just random... What do I just do?
[114:44.90]Oh fuck, I didn't want to do that.
[114:46.16]Um, there are so many random supplements that do that, that say that stuff.
[114:52.28]Smart, and they always, for some reason, they always have two or three big letters at the end.
[114:59.57]I've never been able to figure out why that happens.
[115:01.85]Smart Booster QAZ!
[115:07.42]Smart Booster XR!
[115:10.04]What the fuck is that for?
[115:13.76]It's- They're called Smart Boosters.
[115:15.02]Why are they called Smart Boosters like XR?
[115:19.40]Smart Booster X3!
[115:20.58]Why can't- Why can't it just be Smart Boosters?
[115:27.75]There's a link here.
[115:28.51]Hold on.
[115:29.01]What is it?
[115:31.35]You wouldn't understand.
[115:38.80]What is this?
[115:39.34]Why are you showing me this?
[115:43.24]Wait.
[115:44.30]Okay, hold on.
[115:44.92]Is this... This is a picture of what I believe is me eating some type of food with chopsticks.
[116:01.29]Is that like a takeout container?
[116:02.79]What is that?
[116:04.45]It's me eating food with chopsticks.
[116:07.05]Really just fat and stuff.
[116:15.00]Why am I eating bacon fries with chopsticks?
[116:20.85]It's a straw.
[116:21.87]Oh.
[117:18.29]I kind of lost for a second.
[117:19.85]Why was that important?
[117:23.28]It was very important that I clicked on that.
[117:33.61]What happened?
[117:34.01]Did I just walk in a circle?
[117:34.77]No, no, no.
[117:36.77]Now we go up.
[117:43.01]Just like clockwork!
[117:54.59]Yeah, where's that- there was that little hallway that I could go and open- backtrack and fucking bury, man.
[118:09.28]I'm- I'm safe?
[118:13.61]Back to- yeah, I'm trying to find that rail thing that needed power.
[118:15.91]I don't know, I don't remember where it is.
[118:19.39]Where is the Jerma shit stream?
[118:25.01]Um, I've read that in a bunch of different- I thought you were saying, when- when- when is, like, the good stream Jerma?
[118:30.52]This is shit.
[118:31.34]I thought- I don't know why that's what I've read.
[118:32.80]Okay.
[118:40.52]Um, help me out here.
[118:41.86]Where was that area?
[118:44.36]In the vent, or down here, or down, or over?
[118:47.88]I don't really remember.
[118:52.27]Back dragging.
[118:52.93]I can't do it.
[118:55.81]You went past it?
[118:56.87]Not an event.
[118:57.75]It's just in here.
[118:59.07]Down in the X door.
[119:00.25]Like in here?
[119:05.02]That power source.
[119:17.20]Bro.
[119:18.02]Down the ladder.
[119:18.74]Bro, bro, bro.
[119:21.26]Oh, right.
[119:21.66]Remember I said, what is this thing?
[119:23.36]I gotta go in the lift, right?
[119:43.91]Then... Yeah, right, no.
[119:47.15]Then... Wait, no, this is where I pressed the original button.
[119:52.24]Is it?
[119:52.48]There was a button that I pressed that I went, oh, and the thing crashed.
[119:59.99]Oh, shit.
[120:00.57]Yeah, this is where that one is.
[120:10.67]The edibles kicked in Okay Down the ladder bro
[120:46.19]This is not right.
[120:47.69]This is so wrong, isn't it?
[120:49.53]This is not even right.
[120:50.59]Everyone's so preoccupied with saying, bro.
[120:54.12]That, that, okay.
[120:55.54]Saying bro is Trump's saying like, he's an idiot!
[121:00.40]He's a stupid fucking idiot!
[121:02.66]He's never gonna find it!
[121:04.09]This is wrong.
[121:20.90]The invention of like blips on mini maps.
[121:24.84]Oh man.
[121:25.74]Whoever invented that.
[121:26.94]I hope you patented it.
[121:34.93]What am I doing down here?
[121:35.91]This is wrong.
[121:41.21]We're not going to talk about what I just said.
[121:42.45]What are you talking about?
[121:50.89]I see the saying, bro.
[121:53.35]Trump's saying like, I'm lost.
[122:05.92]Wait, do you guys, you guys not know what the word Trump is?
[122:10.28]It means like over or like over something better than something, right?
[122:18.62]It's a word.
[122:22.72]It's a word.
[122:28.89]I'm seeing a lot of questions.
[122:29.81]This is like me saying like, oh yeah, I put something in a basket.
[122:32.29]And people go, basket?
[122:33.19]What the fuck is a basket?
[122:36.29]What are you talking about?
[122:37.28]Oh, by the way, we also have a president like John Basket.
[122:42.98]There.
[122:43.74]That makes more sense.
[122:56.83]Okay.
[122:57.67]Okay.
[122:57.97]I need to focus.
[122:58.65]I need to know where the hell I'm going.
[123:02.01]Okay.
[123:02.21]What does this say?
[123:03.75]Backup generator.
[123:22.89]What?
[123:23.17]What?
[123:23.73]No.
[123:24.03]No.
[123:24.31]No.
[123:24.59]No.
[123:24.83]What?
[123:25.11]What?
[123:29.37]this way bro oh bro bro
[123:56.85]Okay, so now I have to go all the way back to the other spot.
[124:01.57]To the original activator.
[124:02.91]Security door.
[124:13.59]So that's all the way back here.
[124:15.15]Alright, I want people to correct me if I'm going the wrong way.
[124:19.87]Bro, please.
[124:21.33]I don't... I'm just going to jump over these.
[124:23.81]This is close to where I'm going to be now.
[124:32.92]Okay.
[124:33.72]That other spot.
[124:34.70]Let's see.
[124:37.28]The rail track is fully functional.
[124:38.40]You can now ride a cell further down to the mining core.
[124:41.90]Alright.
[124:50.33]Okay.
[124:53.11]Go where the backup generator is.
[125:02.31]Alright, I'm telling you something.
[125:03.57]If you write in all capitals and you just say, DO MONKEY NOISES, they're funny.
[125:07.73]Oh, but I didn't even- Hey, isn't- Isn't, um, isn't Vin Diesel like a wicked good dude, by the way?
[125:28.19]Like, I just like- I was gonna talk about that yesterday.
[125:41.33]No.
[125:42.22]Yes, he is.
[125:43.06]I heard it.
[125:43.40]I thought he was like a wicked nice guy.
[125:45.28]He's weird.
[125:52.30]Oh.
[125:54.69]Oh, he's not.
[126:00.55]Stop saying wicked.
[126:02.35]Why can I not say that?
[126:11.60]Wasn't he, like, a gamer?
[126:13.02]Wasn't he, like, really into, like, supporting game stuff?
[126:16.26]I don't know.
[126:17.92]My brain of Vin Diesel is, like, 12 years ago.
[126:20.29]I don't remember.
[126:31.63]He eats boiled chicken.
[126:33.77]Whoa, okay, never mind.
[126:36.26]My opinion on him just changed very drastically.
[126:41.95]Oh, fuck.
[126:47.71]Vin Diesel once played D&D with Trump.
[126:49.97]That's naughty.
[126:50.81]You've made that up.
[126:54.96]Like, you've made that up.
[127:04.60]I can't think of something that was more made up than what you just said.
[127:10.35]Wait, and I don't, like, activate it?
[127:13.92]Wait, hold on.
[127:14.82]What?
[127:23.77]Back to the backup generator?
[127:26.49]Back to the generator.
[127:27.69]I was just there.
[127:28.71]I thought that I already turned it on.
[127:35.45]Like, I would believe aliens landed on Earth.
[127:39.77]and like we're all going to be like they're gonna just like enslave like all everybody like we're like aliens come and we're now they like just take over I would believe that more than than vin diesel and Donald trump played dnd together it's real
[128:17.69]This is not that.
[128:18.99]This is toy fair performances.
[128:21.41]This is not Donald Trump playing D&D.
[128:23.94]Uh, I... Okay.
[128:24.18]Never mind.
[128:24.64]What is this Twitter you're doing?
[128:26.26]What are you linking me?
[128:46.93]Okay, I gotta tell you, you can only pull the, like, look at it's a real tweet prank.
[128:58.26]You have to space that out.
[129:01.57]Like, more than a couple of months, I think.
[129:04.43]You just did this two days ago.
[129:07.69]I don't think that works right now.
[129:14.16]Okay, back to the backup generator, which... God!
[129:19.02]Where am I?
[129:24.78]Backup generator.
[129:25.84]I can't... This map isn't even filled in.
[129:27.53]Is this gonna go up?
[129:37.63]There's an elevator, right?
[129:41.39]Oh my god.
[129:42.41]I don't know what the fuck is going on.
[130:01.39]Make monkey noises.
[130:02.57]No, I can't just do it for no reason.
[130:04.99]It's Elmo.
[130:29.25]You're welcome.
[130:30.07]You're welcome.
[130:30.67]That was for the one.
[130:31.71]Thank you.
[130:32.53]My internet reputation has now gone down about three points to make you happy to one person.
[130:38.57]I hope I did.
[130:48.94]Finally, we did it.
[130:49.92]Backup generator.
[130:52.44]Ladies and gentlemen, let's go.
[130:53.79]Here we go.
[131:13.57]What?
[131:26.98]Where was the cutscene where Vin Diesel grabs the thing and we... Oh!
[131:46.31]Why is he playing the shittiest game ever?
[131:47.99]I wouldn't say that.
[131:49.43]Alright, hold on.
[131:50.05]This is not the shittiest game ever.
[131:59.24]No links.
[132:00.22]No links.
[132:00.84]No links.
[132:02.44]What is it?
[132:11.14]I'm not gonna show that on stream.
[132:15.68]I clicked it.
[132:16.20]It was funny.
[132:18.54]I don't know if this guy is a dick in there.
[132:21.79]I don't know.
[132:22.15]I have no idea.
[132:23.15]Where am I?
[132:33.17]What's the goal now?
[132:36.82]Plant the bomb in the gas-filled room.
[132:39.66]The creatures in there will cause a lot of mayhem.
[132:43.10]The gas-filled room?
[132:49.22]Wait.
[132:50.94]Like the room that's all the way over here?
[132:52.80]Who's this?
[133:00.03]You must be Riddick.
[133:01.69]Jaeger told me to wait for you.
[133:04.23]Jaeger's gonna try to reach the spaceport.
[133:08.06]Riddick should put that package from Jupiter in the cave.
[133:11.96]When hell breaks loose, Riddick heads for the spaceport.
[133:15.28]Yeah, that's what he said.
[133:17.00]Hey, look, it's John Basket.
[133:22.23]Oh, look at me.
[133:42.34]I hate John Baskett so much.
[133:44.34]Why?
[133:44.74]You have to chill, man.
[133:55.93]Okay.
[133:57.17]We have to go into the room with the gas.
[133:59.11]And plant the bomb.
[134:00.55]And I think I'm going the right way.
[134:13.22]Here we go.
[134:17.38]Plant the bomb.
[134:22.36]This is so bright.
[134:23.12]Alright.
[134:23.44]Where am I going?
[134:30.89]Get in!
[134:41.47]I don't know why I'm thinking about this, but this just looks like every movie with a budget of under $200,000 when they need to be in a space like this.
[134:52.74]Like a ton of indie movies look like this.
[134:54.34]They make like, oh, I'm in a cave, but it just looks kind of odd with like halogen lights and shit.
[135:04.04]Shit's expensive, guys.
[135:08.30]It really is.
[135:08.82]Hey, James, thanks for the 10 subs.
[135:13.66]Thank you, James.
[135:22.96]What though?
[135:23.78]This is where it opens up and it's Chewbacca.
[135:32.23]You know, it's a friend.
[135:34.91]Right?
[135:35.11]He's going to be like, hey, you didn't think you're going to see me?
[135:41.45]Oh, never mind.
[135:42.59]They do it?
[136:11.13]I've killed so many of these guys.
[136:14.97]They sedated me?
[136:25.15]I'm just pretending to be sedated, right?
[136:28.45]Like the guy came over and grabbed my arm and I went, and I pretended to get knocked out.
[137:01.33]That's me.
[137:02.03]It's me.
[137:02.71]It's me in there.
[137:04.89]It's me.
[137:06.15]Like I put the costume.
[137:08.15]I'm over there.
[137:08.77]Keep an eye on that one.
[137:10.32]I'll check out what's happening.
[137:11.76]Problem.
[137:12.68]Stay down and do not move.
[137:16.90]You see anything?
[137:17.56]Wait, you're talking to the guy in the room with him?
[137:21.81]Darkness.
[137:23.27]It's not dark in here.
[137:24.25]Are you afraid?
[137:26.45]I'm not.
[137:28.01]You can see in this room.
[137:29.39]The darkness is afraid of me.
[137:33.54]I sleep in a room that's brighter than this.
[137:36.04]Where you actually can't see me.
[137:41.23]Wasn't there another guy?
[137:43.15]Where's the second guy?
[138:03.07]That in a- hold on.
[138:04.33]That in other context is so much funnier.
[138:07.37]Like I'm dead and then this- wait, hold on.
[138:09.39]I want to see the death cutscene, the Vin Diesel, the Riddick died cutscene.
[138:14.22]Oh shit!
[138:14.76]Oh, it's getting tough!
[138:18.40]What will our hero do?
[138:26.61]Difficult enemy.
[138:31.08]Shit, he's down.
[138:32.96]Verdict, Verdict died.
[138:34.09]He's your problem now.
[138:52.58]Straps active and tightened.
[138:54.60]Prisoner in place.
[138:55.63]Ready for transport.
[139:16.31]It wasn't very good.
[139:17.07]Ah, it wasn't very good.
[139:18.57]Ah, it wasn't very good.
[139:19.91]It's okay.
[139:20.51]Sometimes you just swing and miss.
[139:34.84]It would have been like, it would have been close.
[139:36.78]It was close.
[139:37.50]Where's my weapons?
[139:44.81]Damn, it wasn't.
[139:46.45]It wasn't.
[139:48.95]Oh well.
[139:51.39]Put a line through that one in the notebook of funny joke material to say on stream.
[139:55.10]Let's go through that one.
[139:58.18]Quick, do a monkey noise.
[139:59.12]You'll be there.
[139:59.78]No, I'd rather have deducted points.
[140:04.10]No, nothing.
[140:10.14]Just a minute.
[140:11.38]There's been a cave in here.
[140:14.53]What is that?
[140:15.15]This is the first time we've seen... Actual dinosaurs in the game.
[140:24.50]Ugh.
[140:44.87]Is this shit in the movie?
[140:45.81]I kind of want to watch this movie now.
[141:00.00]Beautiful.
[141:04.50]So do I go down the... No.
[141:08.34]Do I go down the hole?
[141:15.97]I didn't want to jump in there because I thought people were going to be like, oh, fall joke, fall joke, haha.
[141:19.68]But, like, I think I have to do that.
[141:23.46]Yeah, I was so scared to do that because I didn't want to be accused of making, like, a shitty joke.
[141:31.20]Where is this shotgun?
[141:31.88]He gave me a grenade.
[141:47.43]Oh, you've given me a grenade.
[141:51.81]Okay.
[142:03.36]A lot more anticlimactic when they blow up like that.
[142:10.61]Unfortunately, oh that was supposed to be scary.
[142:13.17]Shit.
[142:23.75]Load it.
[142:30.97]Any more?
[142:34.01]What's up?
[142:38.33]Is there a shitty head trap?
[142:46.13]Oh my god, you have to be good?
[142:47.19]Oh, you have to be good or you're screwed.
[142:49.47]Can I punch in the face?
[142:56.47]Yeah, you can.
[142:56.99]What the hell is this?
[143:04.47]Remember, it's 1pm.
[143:05.32]Time for your smart booster.
[143:15.82]Oh, shit.
[143:20.77]I gotta be better with the aiming of the shotgun, but it's hard to do.
[143:28.47]I wonder how close I am to the end of the game.
[143:46.24]Where did he go?
[143:46.84]I'm trying to find him.
[143:49.79]Okay, well the big guy's gone.
[143:51.27]That's a lot of bullets I don't have to use.
[143:52.59]Use three on that.
[144:07.26]You wouldn't believe how hard it is to aim.
[144:09.76]It's so hard.
[144:13.09]It's so difficult to aim.
[144:18.73]There's nothing in here.
[144:19.55]Play the PC version?
[144:26.48]Don't you guys know the golden rule?
[144:27.82]You cannot stream any game that was on PC that was made before like 2004.
[144:31.51]Because it just has horrendous capture problems.
[144:37.58]I would rather deal with controller aim than have to like screen cap my monitor four times.
[144:48.98]Anything with, like, DirectX 8, DirectX, like, 7 is such a pain in the ass.
[144:53.30]Even DirectX 9, too.
[144:54.26]It could be such a huge pain in the ass.
[144:59.00]Where... Did he just... I think he just damage boosted me.
[145:13.66]Alright, this part's supposed to be cool, but it's actually irritating.
[145:32.60]Security gate.
[145:35.18]Jump!
[145:35.56]Click!
[145:38.68]Old mechanical lock?
[145:45.73]Can I blow it up?
[145:48.79]Old mechanical lock sounds like, hey, throw a grenade at the door.
[145:57.89]Do I need a key?
[146:08.79]Free bullets, I'm in trouble.
[146:11.97]To find the old mechanical key.
[146:20.38]Give me the other shotgun.
[146:21.20]Give me the shotgun.
[146:21.68]Give me, give me, give me.
[146:22.36]Is there another one?
[146:32.69]Old mechanical key.
[146:39.73]Shit!
[146:44.25]Post-processing, please.
[146:45.61]Put on post-processing.
[146:53.85]Why can't I open this?
[147:01.45]Ventilation hatch.
[147:12.75]Why is it doing that?
[147:24.61]I don't have a tool for it anymore?
[147:26.17]How's that... Toolbox right there.
[147:28.49]It's not that bad.
[147:32.42]Bitch.
[147:35.42]Holy, I have 60 shots.
[147:41.08]That's awesome.
[147:48.24]I'm scared in three, two, maybe?
[147:51.42]Maybe?
[148:08.45]Health pack.
[148:09.25]Thank you.
[148:22.72]Are they fighting?
[148:25.94]Alright.
[148:26.84]Cool.
[148:28.16]This way.
[148:33.46]This doesn't look right.
[148:34.92]No, it does kind of look right.
[148:37.26]Not really, but maybe.
[148:38.56]There's the old mechanical key.
[148:46.38]And more shotgun bullets.
[148:51.82]Now I just have to get back to the old mechanical door and everything can be good.
[148:57.05]I want to hear Vin Diesel say more things and grunt in conversation more.
[149:02.37]Get to another NPC quick.
[149:04.17]I'm going for it.
[149:06.31]Power cell is required to operate this machine.
[149:14.75]Do I have to activate this?
[149:35.08]Need power cell.
[149:40.14]Uh, looks like we're going back up.
[149:51.72]I think I'm... Yeah.
[149:52.74]Somebody said it.
[149:53.24]I think I'm... No, here we go.
[149:56.20]I gotta look at what all these things are.
[149:57.60]Power cell waiting room.
[150:04.81]Somewhere else I could go from here?
[150:10.15]Can't open this.
[150:16.81]Am I missing another way to go?
[150:19.63]There's one way.
[150:20.69]Do I have to jump across the bridge or something?
[150:22.71]Smart booster waiting room.
[150:27.28]Stop!
[150:27.78]Okay, I have to make this jump.
[150:37.94]Holy shit, I did it.
[150:52.44]Nice.
[150:52.72]Alright.
[150:55.22]How do you reload?
[150:56.00]Let's do this.
[151:00.74]The game never taught me how to reload.
[151:03.02]I just expected that I knew how.
[151:04.30]Can't press that one?
[151:17.01]What's the last boss of this game?
[151:26.23]Alright, now we gotta go to that mechanical door.
[151:28.17]Which is this way, right?
[151:35.15]Where was that mechanical door?
[151:39.59]Backtrack, backtrack, backtrack, backtrack, backtrack!
[151:43.78]Or was it?
[151:48.10]Go back even further?
[152:13.21]No, this is all the way back.
[152:14.35]No, it's down here.
[152:15.83]That was a friendly?
[152:18.82]No, it was not.
[152:30.94]He wasn't a friendly.
[152:31.74]He was just too big to fit in the doorway.
[152:33.26]I'm wasting a lot of ammo because they just keep respawning these fucking things.
[152:38.26]There's no way for me to... Can I jump that?
[152:42.47]I tried to.
[152:43.99]I did that earlier.
[152:44.71]What the heck?
[152:54.46]Alright, here we go.
[153:05.52]Security gate.
[153:07.92]Alright.
[153:09.42]Missed the romance plot.
[153:11.14]I don't care.
[153:24.69]Alright.
[153:25.33]That's the bottom of the list of things that I want to do in the Chronicles of Riddick game is do the romance mini game.
[153:37.09]Oh god.
[153:37.95]Did I blow the room up?
[153:38.57]Alright, I'm gonna blow the whole room up.
[153:42.43]I only killed one of them.
[153:49.78]I want to heal again.
[153:53.44]Cell recharger?
[153:56.92]Cell recharger!
[154:02.79]I need a cell.
[154:12.34]where's the cell where's the power cell no
[154:26.26]I wouldn't mind the backtracking, but you have to remember, like, okay, you need a power cell to go in that guy, but to get the power cell, you need to go this way, and then you have to charge the power cell in that machine, which is over there.
[154:40.16]You give me too many points to have to refer to.
[154:58.81]I'm good, I'm good.
[155:14.28]What's going on there?
[155:15.53]Why doesn't it want me to do this?
[155:32.34]Alright, give me a battery.
[155:34.38]Power cell.
[155:35.08]Power cell.
[155:35.72]Power cell.
[155:36.34]Tools.
[155:37.62]Battery pack.
[155:42.38]I don't know where that was.
[155:47.78]Power cell.
[155:49.61]Prototype rifle.
[155:53.17]Ooh.
[155:55.15]Alright.
[155:59.67]Anything else I need?
[156:08.60]Get the fuck away from me, please.
[156:15.56]Gunplay?
[156:16.32]Yeah, I know.
[156:19.08]That's sick gunplay.
[156:35.24]Charge the cell.
[156:38.63]Did he get to the diaper section yet?
[156:42.55]I don't think I got to the diaper section yet.
[156:44.51]Sorry, dude.
[156:46.25]Just hang on, though.
[156:47.10]I must be there soon.
[156:47.96]I haven't seen that shit in... It missed me.
[157:15.55]I have to put the power cell into the robot And the robot turns on we press the button and then we go back I don't know.
[157:28.89]I don't know.
[157:30.67]I don't know an event I
[157:42.82]And then we go this way.
[157:49.33]What was that?
[157:51.21]Okay.
[157:53.19]This is the room.
[157:55.53]In here.
[157:56.01]Ah!
[158:08.30]Get in there!
[158:09.76]Can't get in here.
[158:10.76]Grenade his ass.
[158:14.06]That was very quick.
[158:17.50]Okay.
[158:22.92]Power cell socket.
[158:29.57]What does that do?
[158:32.43]Operate the
[158:41.09]cool hey who oh I thought it was a person bent or should I go up try to look around on the bent
[159:11.18]It's vent time.
[159:14.62]You best Vin Diesel.
[159:17.90]I did it, you know what, nah.
[159:21.41]I did it like 10 times yesterday.
[159:32.30]Oh man, they got him.
[159:38.64]NAAIM.
[159:46.20]Oh, this is... Uh... Hang down?
[160:17.13]Imagine you look over to your right, you hear a big thud.
[160:21.73]There's a big thud.
[160:23.80]And you look over and Riddick just, his neck is backwards.
[160:28.08]And it's like, holy shit, that's the guy that's been such a problem.
[160:32.58]He's dead right next to me.
[160:35.68]Holy shit, I could say anything.
[160:38.10]And then you go over this elaborate scheme and elaborate plan of how hard it was to take him down.
[160:43.67]And you took him down.
[160:45.19]You got in a tussle with him.
[160:46.29]You got in a fight.
[160:46.91]You broke his neck and shit.
[160:48.07]And everyone would fear you and respect you for the rest of your life.
[160:52.65]And all he did was fall next to you and die.
[160:56.03]What am I jumping to here?
[161:00.14]I don't think I'm supposed to be doing this.
[161:07.20]Behind me?
[161:07.80]Right.
[161:08.12]EPO happy.
[161:32.29]I can go up or I can go... let's go in here.
[161:36.51]Actually scared the shit out of me.
[161:41.40]That actually scared the shit out of me.
[161:54.43]I'm trying to break his neck.
[162:15.88]Dead end.
[162:26.43]I missed.
[162:32.83]Yo, do monkey noises.
[162:42.07]Take this!
[162:44.91]Okay, I think there's a greater evil.
[162:47.55]Would you say, fellas?
[162:50.60]Fellas, I think there's a greater evil.
[162:52.90]You just got stabbed in the eye with a scorpion tail three times.
[163:00.76]I'm sorry, I haven't... Don't kill me, don't kill me.
[163:09.95]Don't kill me, don't kill me, don't kill me, don't kill me.
[163:11.79]Gun!
[163:16.00]What's this?
[163:16.26]I don't know what to say.
[163:17.70]It's gotten... Um... You bastard.
[163:54.81]Team captains?
[164:09.55]Okay, I need a healing station very very badly.
[164:21.54]Thank you.
[164:32.20]No.
[164:32.70]Alright, back the way that guy exploded.
[164:34.82]Why is it so bright over here?
[164:41.28]What?
[165:08.91]2.5% health down to 1%.
[165:10.55]I can't even click it.
[165:17.28]Alright, somebody explain the meme to me.
[165:18.92]What's like the dot dot dot meme thing?
[165:22.64]Wait, this is awesome.
[165:24.67]My first day in Gmod.
[165:27.73]This is my favorite thing.
[165:57.69]How do you miss with a grenade?
[165:58.65]I don't know.
[166:05.20]Hold on, did I hit the lights?
[166:15.42]How much fucking health do you have?
[166:20.68]Get him!
[166:22.50]Attack him!
[166:40.50]Where did I have a minigun?
[166:45.35]Where is it?
[166:48.77]Minigun.
[166:57.20]Holy shit.
[166:59.02]Let's go.
[167:10.13]Shoot it!
[167:11.83]Shoot him!
[167:25.69]Need more bloom.
[167:34.26]Where's the right way to go?
[167:35.20]This way?
[167:43.63]You have to do a heavy impression.
[167:49.93]There.
[167:51.37]I tried.
[167:52.19]I really did.
[168:00.27]Kind of.
[168:33.33]Dude you don't just come at me like that
[168:52.03]It's only gonna be a pack of cigarettes.
[168:53.47]I don't care.
[168:53.95]I'm leaving.
[168:58.07]Eat sandwich?
[169:02.93]Nah.
[169:06.63]Oh, the loading dock.
[169:10.97]That means I have to say the words NOM seven or eight times in a row.
[169:16.57]And if you do NOM two or three times, you get in a lot of trouble.
[169:28.92]NOM, NOM, NOM, NOM.
[169:37.74]I was four and already the internet hates me.
[169:45.34]Wait, there's more?
[169:51.34]They're on a conveyor belt.
[169:53.81]This is gonna be hell.
[170:03.74]Watch that dude, so bad.
[170:20.96]Apologize for the nomming.
[170:24.06]No!
[170:26.73]Do Austin Powers.
[170:45.83]Come on.
[170:48.65]Who's shooting?
[170:49.81]What is that like weird sound?
[170:53.03]Did you hear that?
[170:54.29]What was that like scrambled sound?
[171:00.12]Do you have him standing there?
[171:04.24]I just did it.
[171:04.98]There you go.
[171:05.46]Thank you.
[171:11.62]Come on.
[171:12.44]Come on.
[171:12.86]You're killing me with this.
[171:14.24]You're killing me.
[171:18.39]I don't want to do... Just kill me so I can do it again.
[171:22.23]You're killing me.
[171:52.86]Okay, ready?
[171:54.39]Ready?
[172:02.93]Go!
[172:19.06]Fucking break.
[172:19.96]Thing couldn't even rev up.
[172:23.94]I should just, I should just run through this.
[172:26.20]Are we gonna play Monkey Ball?
[172:30.21]Very, very soon, actually.
[172:43.89]Like, alright, do you have to spawn these that often?
[173:00.31]You're alive!
[173:10.39]That guy took enough bullets to turn him into a stew and yet he still stands to mock me.
[173:33.31]Alright, let's go.
[173:34.00]Shoot it!
[173:55.41]Shoot it!
[173:57.67]Shoot him!
[174:07.83]What's going on?
[174:09.17]Oh.
[174:10.03]This is a full evacuation.
[174:46.09]Give me that.
[174:50.23]I hear a gun.
[174:52.97]What's a gun?
[174:53.41]I hear a gun.
[174:54.55]What's shooting?
[174:55.11]I hear a gun.
[175:04.96]Knocked drink out of your hand.
[175:06.26]Dude, what the fuck, dude?
[175:08.88]Do a funny voice, comedy streamer.
[175:10.50]Dance for me.
[175:11.76]Throw this guy out.
[175:15.58]Get this guy out of here.
[175:16.42]Throw him out.
[175:23.25]Just knocked my shit out of my hands.
[175:24.61]Get rid of him.
[175:41.64]Slaps your face.
[175:45.39]Slaps your face.
[175:48.97]No, you don't.
[175:50.41]I blocked it.
[176:01.89]I don't know how many things are in here.
[176:03.71]Just one person.
[176:10.18]Bastard!
[176:14.88]Is that a bullet?
[176:26.74]When are you gonna play Saw again?
[176:27.92]Uh, when Saw 2 is played.
[176:48.74]Nothing?
[176:50.58]Big one?
[176:58.00]I thought that was a re- I thought that was a reunion with the robot.
[177:01.12]I thought I was gonna be able to get in.
[177:03.12]Didn't have red eyes.
[177:03.88]They have red eyes when they're mad.
[177:07.22]When they're mean and bad.
[177:20.09]So, um, am I going to escape from Butcher's Bay?
[177:25.47]Or... I feel like I could have probably got out by now.
[177:39.78]I have to pee so bad.
[177:40.62]Alright, let me go pee.
[177:41.16]I'll be right back.
[177:42.90]Pee break.
[177:43.95]Pee break.
[180:08.59]I am back.
[180:12.49]Shall we continue?
[180:22.52]Just like clockwork, that's right.
[180:30.34]Immediately start firing.
[180:36.65]How many people are here?
[180:37.71]Two?
[180:37.95]Three?
[180:47.85]I got no idea.
[180:51.40]I kind of don't want to put this down.
[180:52.56]Alright.
[181:00.05]Not enough for you two.
[181:16.14]That's my thing!
[181:17.20]That's my gig and you stole it from me!
[181:37.75]What?
[181:38.37]What?
[181:42.03]Why are you two just standing here?
[182:02.53]Give me those grenades.
[182:11.07]Oh, I thought there were only two permanent health upgrade.
[182:23.78]Why is everyone going, why not like this?
[182:29.68]Not like this, not like this, not like this, not like this.
[182:40.47]I am for your smart booster.
[182:42.19]No, I refuse to let that become a regular thing I hope he died from his own grenade fire
[183:13.93]It kind of worked.
[183:15.35]That's what pisses me off.
[183:30.20]Don't ever underestimate the power of a dodge roll.
[183:33.17]Ever.
[183:36.39]Okay, now where?
[183:42.45]What's the actual objective here?
[183:44.49]I think I have to lose the minigun.
[183:50.28]I can jump with it.
[183:54.20]I can't.
[183:54.82]Shit, I have to lose the minigun.
[183:59.70]This room must be one of those smart boosters.
[184:01.75]You can't jump with the minigun.
[184:06.59]Well, goodbye minigun.
[184:18.22]It was fun.
[184:18.74]My minigun.
[184:28.80]We can play again.
[184:45.63]When are you going to play Resident Evil 4?
[184:50.55]I don't know, man.
[184:51.17]I'm not going to play it now.
[185:03.13]I don't know.
[185:05.57]Resident Evil 4 is a timeless classic.
[185:07.39]I could play that in 20 years or I could have played it 20 years ago and it'll still be just as good.
[185:11.33]Don't worry.
[185:30.50]I'm really glad I brought the minigun.
[185:35.35]He died extra.
[185:45.09]Where is he?
[185:52.89]Somebody...
[185:59.78]Okay.
[186:00.98]I'm coming.
[186:03.30]I'm coming up there.
[186:04.16]It's going to take me a minute, but I'm going to get there.
[186:19.82]Shoot the gun.
[186:23.94]Am I going to finish this game tonight?
[186:26.71]I feel like I'm very close to the end of the game.
[186:30.40]I think we're pretty much there.
[186:31.72]Those of you that have played this, I'm assuming I'm going to get a comment here that says, yo dude, probably like in another like 25 minutes.
[186:41.88]See?
[186:42.12]Yeah.
[187:05.78]This is really, really far away from how far I had to just go.
[187:23.46]Fuck.
[187:47.14]Um, wait a minute.
[187:48.46]Doesn't this open?
[187:49.90]Yeah, wait.
[187:50.76]I was gonna say, why is this not open?
[187:54.36]It's the same room over and over again?
[187:57.20]Kind of.
[187:57.54]It's the same room over and over again, and sometimes it's pitch black.
[188:09.49]Still dreaming about peeing.
[188:13.49]Quiet!
[188:15.98]How much did you weigh at your prime physique?
[188:20.47]Oh, 160 something.
[188:22.67]Maybe like 165.
[188:23.91]Something like that.
[188:50.41]165 kilograms.
[188:51.61]No, it's pounds.
[188:54.03]I'm from America.
[188:54.79]I don't want to blow this this time.
[188:58.75]Is there something I... Hold on.
[189:00.05]Wait a minute.
[189:07.55]I kind of don't want to take the minigun.
[189:10.91]I'm leaving the minigun.
[189:11.61]If it's a problem, it's a problem.
[189:39.06]What?
[189:47.71]He can't.
[189:50.47]Got him.
[189:50.79]There's another one.
[190:00.02]Refill the nanopod.
[190:01.46]Whatever it is.
[190:14.30]I could go get the minigun now.
[190:15.86]I might need it.
[190:17.30]Yeah, I'll go get it.
[190:24.23]That was a pretty cool game.
[190:27.83]What's over in this slot?
[190:30.35]In this one?
[190:33.54]Has there been anything through the whole game?
[190:37.84]No, not end of the stream voice.
[190:39.34]No, I'm making a statement.
[190:46.14]It's the minigun?
[190:46.82]It's not.
[190:47.20]A minigun doesn't take a slot up.
[190:51.02]Why did I drop it?
[190:51.70]Okay.
[191:03.53]So.
[191:07.57]A button.
[191:13.29]Another button.
[191:27.01]So which one is the right one?
[191:28.07]I'm assuming one of these was just, uh, you picked wrong, now you die, right?
[191:31.83]I think it was that one.
[191:36.82]Yeah.
[191:40.66]Irma's last stream is this fucking crock of shit.
[191:46.14]Why it wouldn't last stream?
[191:51.19]Where are you getting that info from?
[192:06.60]No, I'm not done streaming after this.
[192:11.10]Oh, man.
[192:14.06]Oh, this is it.
[192:15.96]This is the final boss.
[192:49.26]I know what to do.
[192:50.08]You got to drop these things on them.
[193:24.38]What?
[193:25.26]Fucking reload.
[193:37.52]What'd he drop?
[193:40.88]2020 gaming has fucked me up so bad.
[193:44.04]Just the way the games progressed over the years.
[193:46.82]Whenever a big enemy explodes or dies, I just instinctively look for green, blue, and purple text.
[193:56.77]Look at that minigun.
[194:15.40]It's a looter shooter.
[194:24.89]This game doesn't even have Fortnite dances.
[194:28.45]Wait, hangar.
[194:30.09]You know what that means.
[194:31.23]This is it.
[194:32.33]We're going to open up the hangar and it's going to be at the top level.
[194:34.89]We're going to be on the roof and the bad guy is going to be getting in the helicopter and we have to fight the bad guy in the helicopter.
[194:48.17]I can't wait.
[194:52.91]Look at all those preparation last boss in the game guns.
[195:12.78]He's not dead?
[195:27.42]We're in the end game.
[195:28.22]Yeah, we're in the end game.
[195:29.26]This is it.
[195:29.74]This is Vin Diesel Presents.
[195:37.64]I forgot the name of the movie.
[195:39.66]What's the first one called?
[195:45.09]Chronicles of Riddick?
[195:49.39]I told you, here it comes.
[195:59.92]Here he is.
[196:00.44]There he is.
[196:01.90]That's the boss.
[196:02.60]That's the last boss.
[196:12.97]You didn't get on the helicopter.
[196:26.79]Riddick.
[196:28.31]I don't think you'll- Wait, here it comes.
[196:42.52]Hello?
[196:56.20]We're back on track?
[196:57.76]I mean... Why are we using a screwdriver?
[197:01.57]Okay, stupid question.
[197:05.03]We'll be fine in a minute.
[197:06.35]Sit down and stay out of my way.
[197:08.11]Sure.
[197:09.61]Sure, Riddick.
[197:12.29]What?
[197:13.78]You're always trying to ruin my paydays, Riddick.
[197:16.26]Oh, it's a double cross.
[197:17.46]He's bound to give me more than 22% after this.
[197:21.36]Now, come on.
[197:22.10]Let's go.
[197:30.70]But this is not the ultimate bad guy.
[197:32.38]This is second in command bad guy.
[197:34.18]No time like the present, Johns.
[197:45.65]The actual double cross.
[197:50.42]Good effort.
[197:52.08]Bad result.
[197:54.46]He's here.
[197:56.28]He's got a weapon.
[197:59.86]Wait, what?
[198:08.32]Okay, if I get put in a device and go back into prison, this is stupid.
[198:15.11]If I get put in the Hannibal Lecter device and I go back downstairs, I'm gonna be like, alright, well that was funny.
[198:23.21]It's like the third time I've been put in that machine to go back to jail.
[198:33.76]Oh, come on.
[198:34.50]No.
[198:36.52]We have to do this.
[198:37.08]This is the third time we've done this.
[198:38.80]And you, Riddick.
[198:40.84]Well, your luck has just run out.
[198:43.42]Since you are a little too volatile to keep in the general population, I'm putting you in cold storage.
[198:52.00]I could use the rest.
[198:53.85]Give my ribs time to heal.
[198:56.31]Only if Jagger had been a better shot, you'd be dead.
[198:59.77]And I'd be off this rock.
[199:02.49]So we both lose.
[199:04.43]Isn't that the way with us, Johns?
[199:06.15]Lose?
[199:06.35]What are you talking about?
[199:08.91]What's he talking about?
[199:09.83]I said you were lucky to be alive, Johns.
[199:16.93]But luck can be fleeting.
[199:19.87]Riddick has already cost me plenty.
[199:23.36]Far more than you're worth, to be honest.
[199:26.54]I'm just getting started, Hexy.
[199:29.97]yes I was afraid of that that's why I'm having you put into cryo sleep why won't they just kill me just like kill me you have a guy right there that has a gun that he'd shoot me in the face why don't you do that what's with all the weird 80s 90s 2000s villains that just want to like they don't want to get rid of you they want to like keep you around forever
[200:01.14]There's always some weird elaborate- Is my plane portal?
[200:03.96]Sunset.
[200:04.22]Tree.
[200:04.40]Ocean.
[200:28.59]Okay.
[200:29.89]Sunset, tree, flow, ocean.
[200:35.49]Sunset, tree, flow, ocean, TV.
[200:39.97]Sedative administered.
[201:00.52]What's going on?
[201:01.10]Oh, this is scripted.
[201:03.79]Somebody said I was waiting for it and knew it.
[201:05.67]What?
[201:09.65]You said exercise!
[201:16.36]Kill exercise!
[201:21.68]I haven't seen a few of it in like 200 years.
[201:23.90]I've been sleeping and you put a guy in here that looks scary?
[201:28.70]Oh, wait there.
[201:29.68]Where are they?
[201:30.35]Oh, I have to do... Okay, don't fuck that up again.
[201:59.16]Gonna start banging my head against the wall until they get me out of here.
[202:01.84]Are they gonna sedate me or what?
[202:25.22]Let me get my big gamer chair.
[202:29.35]Going out of my own way.
[202:34.21]Your two minutes of daily exercise begins now.
[202:38.52]This exercise appointment will be shared by multiple prisoners.
[202:42.52]All contact is forbidden.
[202:45.62]What's the exercise?

[203:46.52]Do I punch it?
[203:47.36]Do I like break it?
[204:10.93]Okay, so he gets put away.
[204:13.63]And then... Another one wakes up.
[204:15.25]Sedative administered.
[204:42.88]Why are they doing a sedative to me?
[204:44.46]I tried to talk to them and they gave me a sedative.
[204:54.37]I was pressing Y and it wasn't doing anything.
[204:58.15]All contact is forbidden.
[204:59.43]Ohhhhhh.
[205:01.03]All contact is forbidden.
[205:08.25]That means you can't talk to anyone.
[205:10.19]Why would it give me the option to talk to them?
[205:36.38]I'm not talking- I'm not touching anybody.
[205:37.70]I'm not talking to anybody.
[205:44.38]What?
[205:56.93]Your two minutes of exercise begins now.
[206:00.19]Exercise appointment.
[206:01.29]Okay.
[206:12.69]Wait, I could just... Why was that a prompt to enter the cryo box and now I can't get it to pop back up?
[206:21.04]Like that prompt won't appear anymore.
[206:22.68]I can't get in his box.
[206:23.82]I was too slow?
[206:24.68]I'll get this one.
[206:51.85]I have to do it to that first one.
[206:55.53]Well, how am I supposed to know I'm supposed to get in somebody else's box?
[207:09.74]Okay, guys.
[207:12.70]Where's the magic prompt now?
[207:16.40]Yes, it's cryo self.
[207:17.84]Oh, he told me.
[207:18.56]Don't go!
[207:27.60]Get in his cell!
[207:33.80]Closer!
[207:34.56]How much more close can I get to his coffin?
[207:39.43]Guys, I've been standing here this whole time and there's no prompt to get in his cryo chamber.
[207:56.13]How did I do that wrong?
[207:58.67]Stand on it.
[208:03.01]I'm going to get in this cryo bed.
[208:08.75]I don't know where that is.
[208:14.23]That was not... Go back and watch the mod.
[208:16.61]Go back and rewind.
[208:17.53]Watch that didn't happen.
[208:18.89]I went to the same exact spot.
[208:20.59]Go back and watch the mod.
[208:23.17]The prompt didn't pop up when I walked over to it.
[208:38.87]You didn't though, and laughing at me.
[208:40.87]Don't laugh at me.
[208:45.26]I was walking all over the fucking thing.
[208:49.40]I stood in the bed.
[208:50.68]I was lying in the bed.
[208:51.98]I was sitting in the bed.
[208:53.23]What are we doing this part of the game for anyways?
[209:22.80]There are a bunch of different Riddick's that they keep in cubes.
[209:44.24]Yo, what?
[209:46.83]I wasn't paying attention to that.
[209:48.33]I said they keep out Riddick and cubes.
[209:52.39]That was a good joke?
[209:54.69]Oh, I wasn't looking.
[209:55.49]Alright, I'll give you a really good joke.
[210:05.75]Somebody just said.
[210:14.71]Riddick and Morty.
[210:18.11]That's pretty funny.
[210:21.51]Okay, what did I do wrong there?
[210:24.01]Why take me out of the box?
[210:26.35]Why did you take me out of the box?
[210:29.44]Who the fuck are you?
[210:30.62]Who is this?
[210:31.08]I don't know what that was.
[210:44.33]He gave me a club.
[210:45.43]I think that was a friend.
[210:47.31]Oh shit.
[210:50.28]Wait!
[210:54.12]It didn't work.
[211:09.77]He's resistant.
[211:23.83]Alright, bye.
[211:31.27]I have too much of a THC tolerance now.
[211:34.02]I used to be really, really low tolerance.
[211:35.74]Not anymore.
[211:36.28]It happened too many times.
[211:37.28]I died in that stupid fucking portal room too many times.
[211:46.86]I hear a lot of noise.
[211:47.60]Attention.
[211:50.99]Unscheduled presence reported.
[211:52.69]Please investigate.
[212:00.58]I got hit by a set piece.
[212:05.76]One of the stage lights came down and crashed me in the head.
[212:08.92]Okay.
[212:19.72]Sure.
[212:22.22]How did that hit me in the head last time?
[212:36.09]And why am I fighting a bunch of expensive coffee makers?
[212:39.03]Oh shit.
[212:49.46]Okay, I don't have any health.
[212:53.90]Can I block?
[213:15.90]How?
[213:29.42]And is somebody with a gun?
[213:31.52]How am I supposed to do this?
[213:38.23]I have the idea.
[213:40.35]The idea is get to the health station.
[213:47.46]Here he comes.
[213:52.16]Give me your gun.
[213:56.10]Gun.
[213:56.60]64 shots.
[214:17.17]That was a fun carnival game.
[214:38.26]Why is the cryo jail easier than the mines?
[214:42.59]Yeah, I don't know.
[214:45.38]Why was the mines the most horrible thing ever?
[214:48.00]Everything else was so much fun and then it just ruined everything.
[215:02.56]Where is he?
[215:03.78]He can't shoot through that glass.
[215:16.00]Holy shit, dude, your aim.
[215:22.90]I'm fine.
[215:25.28]It's tricky.
[215:29.25]Open the container doors.
[215:30.97]Okay, there's monsters over there.
[215:35.51]There are legit monsters here now.
[215:39.28]Huge ones.
[215:39.76]How am I supposed to get away from those?
[215:48.93]Oh my god, you fucking Empire Death Star looking assholes.
[215:52.27]I swear to god.
[215:54.19]Why does it... Why did we open... Those robots aren't tough.
[216:15.98]Just blast them.
[216:19.52]Yeah, it's the people that are the problem.
[216:22.08]It's the enemy NPCs.
[216:23.86]Those are the issues.
[216:27.17]Wait, that guy doesn't even know.
[216:29.35]Perfect time for a headshot.
[216:30.31]Irma, auto.
[216:46.84]My turn.
[216:49.67]Alright, I have to be ready for this.
[216:51.79]Gotta be ready.
[216:52.91]Here we go.
[216:53.51]I don't know what the fuck.
[217:08.10]It's so... It's so stupid.
[217:27.76]Why are the people the hardest enemies in the game?
[217:31.77]I fought gigantic robots that took way less effort than shooting a regular guy with a pistol.
[217:45.83]You shouldn't stream on CBD.
[217:47.10]This is bad.
[217:47.72]This is atrocious.
[217:49.50]This is every single stream.
[217:51.00]You may have just came here like an hour ago.
[218:03.19]This is pretty much every... This is how it is.
[218:06.81]In fact, I think I'm doing better than usual.
[218:09.11]So, I'll tell you.
[218:10.03]It only goes downhill from there.
[218:26.53]The last one.
[218:30.99]Give me that shotgun.
[218:31.75]How- The fuck?
[218:52.15]It's just the same engine as Simpson's hit and run.
[218:57.07]I sincerely doubt that.
[219:00.61]Also, I'm not playing this on PC.
[219:01.97]There are probably people that... Alright, let me tell you something.
[219:04.33]There's probably people that come into this stream and think that I'm using a mouse and I'm playing like this.
[219:12.48]It's gotta be at least some people probably think that, right?
[219:22.63]I mean, if I knew this was on PC, and I knew this guy, like, predominantly played on PC, this is like, holy shit, man.
[219:29.09]Like, you gotta, you gotta go.
[219:31.15]Like, you gotta stop screaming.
[219:39.58]Like, hold on, I'll get up there.
[219:40.96]It's like, whoa, man.
[220:10.95]That wasn't that bad.
[220:16.01]Although, wait, I can be one of those, like, Mushroom Kingdom people?
[220:20.48]Somebody just spoiled it.
[220:23.18]Oh, you spoiled it right before I got in one.
[220:26.34]Come on, dude.
[220:32.43]Oh, what?
[220:35.25]Look.
[220:38.25]Oh, my goodness.
[220:44.02]We just got to the end of the movie and I walked into a room and the bad guy was in there and he says, oh, he shoots the bad guy in the head right now.
[220:49.87]Boom.
[220:51.73]Come on.
[220:52.37]I knew it was going to happen, but let me see it in real time.
[220:54.75]This one talks.
[220:55.39]I don't even need to do the voice.
[221:19.38]Robocop, yeah.
[221:29.63]Alright just kill me because I was not ready for that.
[221:49.77]That sounded like somebody slammed the door, like somebody got up.
[221:53.12]They were watching the stream and they were like, I'm done.
[221:54.76]I'm fucking out of here.
[221:56.78]I just heard a door slam.
[222:09.05]Holy shit, this is impossible to use.
[222:25.44]It has rockets?
[222:27.00]How do I use them?
[222:29.96]Kill me.
[222:30.42]Start off with full health.
[222:32.70]Oh.
[222:33.00]Did I use the... Is that it?
[222:33.81]Who?
[222:39.05]Who?
[223:06.51]It's too much.
[223:08.59]Take care of that light.
[223:15.55]He was made out of Legos.
[223:23.47]That was perfect.
[223:24.59]That was wonderful.
[223:29.83]Who's shooting at me?
[223:31.68]I don't know.
[223:32.62]I'm too big.
[223:56.15]that's not happening man
[224:24.63]No!
[224:26.65]He's moving around too much.
[224:27.81]Die!
[224:32.18]Come on, XB-88 Battlesuit.
[224:34.74]Ready.
[224:37.52]XB-22 Battlesuit ready.
[224:53.74]Through the window?
[225:14.18]Oh, no, Larry.
[225:15.08]It looks like a dog got into one of the controls of the heavy guards.
[225:22.28]You can dodge it pretty easily, but just be fucking careful.
[225:37.49]Am I getting backseat gamed by the robot in the game now?
[225:41.23]Got him.
[225:46.60]Stand still and you'll regen.
[226:04.53]That's Barry the Chopper from Fullmetal Alchemist, by the way.
[226:06.49]I'll take a thousand points for that.
[226:07.55]Yeah, it is.
[226:18.95]And where are they?
[226:51.96]Uh-oh.
[226:54.26]Uh-oh.
[226:58.78]I wanted to die anyways.
[227:01.90]The whole regens.
[227:04.54]Was it though?
[227:04.93]I feel like it wasn't.
[227:10.87]The other one didn't do it.
[227:11.91]Why would this one do it?
[227:12.95]It does.
[227:13.45]What?
[227:13.65]What?
[227:18.73]I don't think it is, actually.
[227:19.57]I think that's a... I can't tell.
[227:23.09]Is that just the background I'm looking at?
[227:28.84]It was only rockets for robots.
[227:33.72]Oh, it is.
[227:34.06]Okay, let's just hang on.
[227:50.19]Nightbot banned me.
[227:51.15]Omega low.
[227:51.71]Well, you shouldn't be acting up then.
[227:53.41]You should be behaving yourself.
[228:08.50]They open up the curtains.
[228:13.80]I know they're in there.
[228:14.58]Just open it.
[228:15.20]I open the curtain.
[228:16.80]I know they're in here.
[228:17.64]Okay.
[228:38.14]Okay.
[228:42.16]He moved.
[228:43.28]He like jostled to the left.
[228:51.53]Okay.
[228:56.58]I feel like I have TTS on right now and you guys are just paying like three or four dollars to like say fucking mean shit to me.
[229:13.69]Please, please, please.
[229:15.56]What?
[229:15.76]I don't want to.
[229:17.36]TTS is never going to be on this stream.
[229:20.66]It just won't ever happen.
[229:22.24]It's too distracting for me.
[229:28.71]Can I leave the area?
[229:30.09]It's annoying.
[229:34.88]It just distracts me.
[229:38.29]You think I have attention problems in games now?
[229:41.07]Imagine with TTS.
[229:53.83]I would do TTS maybe once or twice if it made sense and it was something that was a major part of the stream.
[230:21.24]Okay, so if you're a part of the group that he was just with, do you continue to walk this way?
[230:27.17]Or do you go, holy shit, and, well, it looks like... Sure.
[230:36.65]Oh, you wouldn't.
[230:43.85]Where do I go?
[230:46.78]Do one TTS stream, but do a children's puzzle.
[231:01.62]I mean, that might be funny.
[231:03.92]That might be fun.
[231:05.22]Can you press buttons?
[231:13.13]Do you think exit immediately?
[231:28.07]Why is he kicking me out?
[231:28.93]He's literally kicking me out.
[231:32.09]That's not cool.
[231:32.81]I can't take him with me?
[231:34.49]Okay.
[231:57.92]Am I gonna die in a cutscene?
[232:11.67]Somebody said incoming capture.
[232:14.97]Incoming metal thing around neck.
[232:18.99]I hope not.
[232:36.16]Do I control the plane now?
[232:37.46]I thought this was a bad guy.
[233:02.60]Wait, did he think he was going to take me to another prison?
[233:08.81]He was haphazardly pointing the gun behind him.
[233:12.71]Like he was looking in the backseat to talk to kids in the backseat.
[233:17.14]That wasn't... Was he good?
[233:20.18]Was that a turn?
[233:21.08]I don't get it.
[233:31.14]Why wouldn't you just leave, Riddick?
[233:34.68]Why come back here?
[233:35.99]I guess you wanted John's dead.
[233:40.37]Not alive.
[233:41.77]Riddick.
[233:42.47]Just shoot a missile into the window and leave.
[233:45.35]You'll probably- you'll get him.
[233:50.94]Just hold a middle finger, like, right out the front window and shoot- and make sure he sees.
[233:54.88]Anything.
[233:55.50]Anything.
[233:56.38]Just tell me what you want, Riddick, and I'll make it happen.
[234:07.31]What the fuck is that device?
[234:08.49]That chair doesn't make any sense.
[234:10.44]That's the most bizarre piece of architecture I've ever seen in a house.
[234:16.84]What's the point of that?
[234:18.12]Why would you not go...
[234:39.42]Okay.
[234:42.00]Well, here's a shotgun.
[234:45.18]I got a shotgun and I'm fighting his most intense unit.
[234:58.53]Maximum security gamer room.
[235:00.63]That's what somebody just said.
[235:02.15]And I cannot think of a more stupid way to describe what we just watched.
[235:08.80]Maximum security gamer room.
[235:11.92]I've got my two gamer defense robots.
[235:14.88]Wasn't he just right here?
[235:26.14]He can teleport.
[235:28.48]Thanks for the last encounter of the game showing me that things can disappear and teleport.
[235:46.24]Alright, Riddick, how do we get rid of the sun?
[236:23.01]They can just see me now, so... You know...
[236:42.74]Hold the button down, it overheats.
[237:12.65]What?
[237:13.18]Where's my... What is it?
[237:18.82]Almost at the end of chapter one.
[237:27.49]Pog.
[237:28.85]Hide behind a pillar?
[237:29.95]They teleport!
[238:05.07]Should I just use the shotgun instead?
[238:26.68]Okay.
[238:27.78]That's just... That's really cool.
[238:37.18]Where the hell is he?
[238:44.19]Uhhhhhh.
[238:55.39]God fucking damn it.
[239:07.64]Alright, one of them sucks.
[239:09.38]One of them really, really sucks.
[239:10.78]So I can just get rid of the one that really, really, really sucks first.
[239:15.08]It's this one.
[239:15.52]This guy's an idiot.
[239:16.76]Good.
[239:24.17]That was so easy.
[239:25.53]That was so easy.
[239:26.65]Should have been that easy.
[239:27.27]I was holding the minigun down.
[239:44.55]What?
[239:47.98]Wait, there's no way to leave?
[239:52.50]So he was just in there, enclosed in this little sphere?
[239:55.50]Oh, shit.
[239:56.10]Hopefully they get him.
[239:57.42]You wouldn't have a little back door?
[239:58.69]Good.
[240:26.46]We're under arrest?
[240:27.28]No, no, no.
[240:27.92]We're pretending to be arrested.
[240:57.63]When they realize this, who do you think blames who for that one?
[241:04.55]What if these guys just get on the next plane and leave?
[241:09.77]Imagine thinking that was a Riddick.
[241:17.53]This guy's clearly... You have flashlights.
[241:19.47]He's clearly tied to a chair.
[241:23.22]With like a gag in his mouth.
[241:33.94]He wasn't bald.
[241:36.56]Well, that's the end.
[241:37.06]I won.
[241:43.87]I only got medium.
[241:56.64]That's funny.
[242:00.10]Now do the sequel.
[242:01.14]I'm not doing the whole sequel.
[242:02.48]We'll check it out.
[242:03.18]How about that?
[242:03.95]I'll check out the sequel.
[242:05.37]I'm not doing it all.
[242:08.47]I'll go into Dark Athena and I'll look around.
[242:10.73]I can't skip.
[242:26.52]Can I?
[242:36.35]Oh, we just jumped right in!
[242:40.87]Uh, what's- how do I rate, uh, escape from- well, here's the thing.
[242:44.56]So... Dark Athena... is just a- essentially like a long DLC campaign.
[242:54.54]They remade Butcher's Bay.
[243:02.21]No one said that.
[243:03.01]I said that, because I did my research.
[243:13.23]So, turns out we didn't make it out.
[243:20.43]No more of this.
[243:25.71]I just want to look around.
[243:33.46]Alright, if I can swim, we'll play.
[243:35.83]If I cannot swim, we won't play, okay?
[243:38.27]I have a feeling they added swimming to this one.
[243:39.93]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[244:05.15]Red light on door.
[244:06.07]Yeah, I already know this.
[244:07.91]I've played this.
[244:10.71]Press X to go into stealth and crouch.
[244:15.68]I want to kill one person.
[244:22.42]It's called eye shine?
[244:26.04]I need to watch these movies.
[244:27.36]I feel like I've been so lost.
[244:38.89]Wait, did he say kill me please or don't kill me please?
[244:50.15]I feel like that's really important what first word is there
[245:03.72]He said, play Fall Guys.
[245:06.28]No.
[245:07.10]No, he did not.
[245:08.44]And even if he did, I'm not sure I would do it.
[245:10.64]Oh, oh, oh!
[245:15.60]I always want to look at the extra content.
[245:24.49]Intruder.
[245:26.45]Chicken.
[245:27.53]Shitworm wrangler!
[245:30.11]Saganite!
[245:40.50]Shit worm wrangler.
[245:46.08]Help.
[245:47.14]Yeah.
[245:48.49]Wait, when you palms... What?
[245:51.23]Was that a new move in... I think I missed it.
[246:01.20]It was just counter.
[246:02.02]Oh, okay.
[246:04.42]Making sure.
[246:04.96]Well, this was fun.
[246:10.21]I had fun playing Riddick.
[246:12.57]I knew the game was worth playing and it was worth playing.
[246:15.37]I think it was fun.
[246:16.21]I think I had a really good time playing it.
[246:29.50]You know what's funny though?
[246:31.00]There's not been one opportunity where I really, really needed to use the stealth.
[246:36.77]Like not the stealth, the drag.
[246:38.59]The drag body thing.
[246:51.38]Am I supposed to go over here?
[246:52.18]Uh, what?
[246:58.82]Let's play Sonic Adventure 2 on the Dreamcast.
[247:05.91]No, I already played Sonic.
[247:15.29]Pull this grate off?
[247:23.01]Okay.
[247:25.51]While in stealth mode, the blue... Wait, I had to wait?
[247:29.75]I had to wait this whole time.
[247:32.39]Oh, this is a... Wait, whose gun is this?
[247:44.96]Am I holding this dude?
[247:47.02]I've got this dude hostage!
[247:57.64]Alright.
[248:03.88]You're coming with me.
[248:04.48]Let's go.
[248:04.82]Hostage.
[248:14.99]Wow.
[248:15.29]Why was this not in the first game?
[248:24.82]This dude's dead?
[248:34.83]What?
[248:35.13]The guy is the gun?
[248:48.71]That's actually pretty cool.
[248:54.35]I can't walk forward with him, though.
[248:55.89]That's kind of annoying.
[249:04.41]Oh, that's a health kit.
[249:05.72]I don't have any.
[249:08.30]Do now.
[249:18.91]That's a different mechanism.
[249:19.81]I feel like that's probably more comfortable than the last one.
[249:25.60]Stuff them in your inventory.
[249:31.70]Play Fall Guys.
[249:34.34]Hey, stay right there.
[249:39.44]Hold on, just stay right there for a minute.
[250:05.35]You guys really want to see fall, guys?
[250:06.79]Really?
[250:07.11]He's alive still.
[250:18.28]You, you garter.

[251:09.19]Remember, there are children watching this stream.
[251:10.85]Well, hey, you clicked on the 18 filter in the beginning.
[251:13.98]If you're not old enough to see somebody get hit, then you gotta get out of here.
[251:19.86]Leave.

[252:34.36]I know it.
[252:35.21]Absolutely, it's on.

[252:43.67]Okay.

[252:46.60]Yes, it's enabled.
[252:49.12]I'm being lied to.
[252:49.94]It's alright.
[252:55.55]For every time that I fall down a hole, chat tells me one lie.
[253:07.52]Alright, I'm not going to play through Dark Athena, I don't think.
[253:09.38]I just want to see what it was like.
[253:11.02]I just want to see how fun it looked.
[253:14.74]You know, I'll play like one or two rounds of Fall Guys.
[253:21.66]Because you guys aren't going to see me again until like Sunday.
[253:23.67]So, we'll play some Fall Guys.
[253:28.15]To end the stream.
[253:35.30]Dark Athena is great.
[253:37.50]Yeah, I know, I know.
[253:40.22]It looks fun.
[253:42.08]But, I don't know if I want to give it like the five to six hours right now.
[253:46.40]Because that's not going to happen.
[253:49.22]And you know me, DLC Jeremy never happens.
[253:54.82]So I wanted to make sure I got to look at it.
[253:59.77]So we'll play like a round or two of Fall Guys.
[254:05.15]But I had a good time.
[254:06.77]The last two streams I thought were very, very fun.
[254:08.43]I had a great time.
[254:09.69]Hope you did too.
[254:10.31]Let's play a round or two of Fall Guys.
[254:11.87]That was really fun.
[254:17.27]Oh, the extras!
[254:44.53]Creepy.
[254:46.46]Creepy.
[254:46.96]Cool.
[254:52.02]Don't play Fall Guys.
[254:54.58]It's a YouTuber bait.
[254:55.80]I played it a couple days ago and it was... It was alright.
[254:59.38]I had a little bit of fun.
[255:01.54]Do it one more time.
[255:10.19]Okay, where's the trailer?
[255:12.81]You know what's in here.
[255:14.15]Where's the trailer for the next Vin Diesel movie?
[255:27.21]Nice job, guys.
[255:33.97]Hold on.
[255:43.24]It is only you that matters, Riddick.
[255:46.08]It's not the trailer for the movie.
[255:52.65]Cool.
[255:57.53]Nice.
[256:01.17]Wait, this wasn't made by one guy?
[256:02.77]Wait, wait, wait.
[256:06.61]Is Vin Diesel on the team?
[256:11.04]I don't see him there.
[256:13.32]Missing!
[256:14.92]Vin Diesel.
[256:19.56]Well, they rented a space at the bottom part there.
[256:22.16]Oh.
[256:23.85]Well, he didn't work on it.
[256:24.69]Oh.
[256:27.07]Alright.
[256:28.83]Alright, let's play Fall, guys.
[256:30.31]I'm gonna play, like, only one or two rounds just to kind of end the stream.
[256:34.11]Because we did, like, a four-hour stream yesterday and I'm still alright.
[256:36.88]I still feel okay.
[256:38.46]So...
[256:39.78]I'm good for another probably 45 minutes or so.
[256:42.08]Maybe an hour or two.
[256:44.06]We'll see.
[256:46.04]Alright, let's... I'll be right back.
[256:48.04]Just to change this game and stuff and get everything ready to go.
