[00:00.72]Hey, how are you?
[00:01.24]Just checking into my hotel room here at PAX East.
[00:03.69]It's a very nice hotel.
[00:04.85]It's a very beautiful hotel room.
[00:06.49]See, we've got a nice sink here.
[00:07.59]We've got a nice, uh, you know, a nice public bathroom toilet.
[00:12.60]No big deal.
[00:13.45]Like, no big deal.
[00:15.85]Just like a bathroom you'd see at, like, fucking Fridays.
