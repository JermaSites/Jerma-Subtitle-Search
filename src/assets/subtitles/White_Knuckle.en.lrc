[00:25.36]hello there welcome to a stream this is a gaming sesh gaming session the title means can play something I might tell us I might tell a story or two you know
[00:54.64]Today, we're going to play White Knuckle.
[01:01.97]And this game is a special request from Stirr.
[01:06.88]Stirr is, I think Stirr said this game is very, very good.
[01:09.45]He's a big fan, apparently.
[01:12.69]I looked into it for the last week or two.
[01:17.76]Didn't look at too much.
[01:19.42]I just know it's a climbing game and it could be a rage game.
[01:23.00]So we'll see.
[01:23.69]But I'm just going to play.
[01:24.59]We're going to hang out.
[01:28.57]House Slipper.
[01:29.11]I will give a House Slipper update.
[01:33.78]Just checking in before we do the ads before the stream starts.
[01:37.08]They should get started any second here.
[01:41.11]If they don't, then oh boy, I screwed up.
[01:47.88]We'll see if they start right now.
[01:49.56]If they do, good.
[01:50.24]If not, then we can hang on.
[02:00.14]And we all screw up sometimes.
[02:01.74]Yeah.
[02:02.20]Yeah, there'll be a House Flipper update.
[02:07.97]It's looking like probably shooting for...
[02:15.74]It's not going to be able to be this weekend or next weekend.
[02:19.02]I don't think so.
[02:20.43]But we're trying to get somewhere in that Monday to Tuesday 23-24.
[02:23.17]That's the plan.
[02:29.62]Round two will be about a week or so from now.
[02:31.88]A week and a half.
[02:34.04]Trying to corroborate everybody's schedules.
[02:37.02]Which is the hardest part.
[02:38.42]That is the hardest part.
[02:42.85]But yeah, you'll see it.
[02:43.53]You'll see it soon.
[02:53.08]uh ads just started but I don't know why it's only one minute hold on I can hear Twitch what have you got going on here this should be three minutes so we don't get pre-rolls uh what no it was changed oh dang it
[03:24.15]It's alright.
[03:26.70]Supposed to be three minutes every hour.
[03:34.73]The one minute of ads just happened.
[03:36.55]So let's go ahead.
[03:44.03]Yeah, it looks like it was three minutes on the dashboard, but.
[03:51.00]okay um well that kind of messes things up but it's alright we'll work with it we'll work with it I'm just gonna get started we're gonna play I'm gonna have to do an ad break in 20 minutes and then not for an hour and 20 minutes after that alright so hi welcome back from that one minute ad break see you guys uh in just about 10 seconds because we're just gonna get started what about oblivion alright oblivion
[04:18.22]Oblivion is, I don't know, maybe today, maybe tomorrow.
[04:21.86]I don't know.
[04:23.54]It's in that weird space where there's other things I want to do, but I still want to do Oblivion.
[04:27.49]So we'll see.
[04:28.01]I might play it later tonight.
[04:28.83]I might get addicted to White Knuckle.
[04:29.95]We don't know.
[04:31.99]We'll see.
[04:37.46]Let me make sure this is set, which it should be now.
[04:43.51]Okay.
[04:45.19]We'll make it work.
[04:49.17]Alright, so this is White Knuckle and this game seems pretty cool.
[04:56.72]Like I said, this is a Ster special request special.
[05:01.47]I don't know anything about this game.
[05:06.18]It's a heart attack game.
[05:08.78]Oh, well, that's just wonderful.
[05:09.85]What's going to play it?
[05:11.05]I don't know if I'm going to have facecam on for this.
[05:13.58]It's like 100 degrees in Vegas right now.
[05:16.00]I am as nude as you can get.
[05:19.41]You know, without it being inappropriate.
[05:22.49]But I'm fairly nude.
[05:24.24]I'm fairly nude.
[05:25.54]So I'm not doing facecam.
[05:26.92]Ain't happening.
[05:30.37]I should probably do the tutorial.
[05:37.87]Okay, well, let me, I gotta, I gotta turn the sensitivity way down.
[05:42.16]I think Ster is here.
[05:43.04]He said, I'm going to watch the whole thing.
[05:44.70]He's like, I cannot wait.
[05:45.74]It's like my favorite game ever made.
[05:46.97]Okay.
[05:56.31]Future maintenance worker basic welcome to the substructure 17 maintenance traversal exam.
[06:03.90]This exam will test your navigational and problem solving capabilities to ensure that you are capable of accessing parts of the substructure.
[06:15.36]Is this a controller game?
[06:19.62]Hey, this is a rubbish game.
[06:20.98]I think that person should be timed out for at least 45 minutes.
[06:25.83]Dude, I looked at the basic movement on the left side of the panel.
[06:29.27]I'm sorry, dude.
[06:30.21]What does this take?
[06:33.40]Alright.
[06:33.90]Shift, jump, sprint.
[06:35.02]Let's go.
[06:35.90]Alright.
[06:36.70]Left click and right click.
[06:37.50]Ready your hands to grab a climbable surface.
[06:41.35]Alright.
[06:41.67]I feel like this is how I talk to people.
[06:44.33]Okay.
[06:44.61]So let me tell you something.
[06:45.65]The thing is, wait a minute.
[06:47.81]So if we're going to go on that ride at the carnival, I feel like I do that a lot.
[06:51.78]Alright, once grabbed, look at the wall and move towards it.
[06:55.36]Are you ready?
[06:55.89]Then grab.
[06:59.95]Your hands will automatically grab any valid nearby mantelable surface.
[07:05.51]Jump and aim at the high ledge above.
[07:07.20]Well, OK, so you kind of just.
[07:10.12]Oh OK, so they turn red, which means that you're out of stamina.
[07:16.99]You just kind of vault over alright.
[07:20.82]Yeah, ready his hands to grab a climbing surface.
[07:22.55]Use your movement keys to navigate between climbable surfaces up to the platform above you.
[07:26.31]So you just kind of have to... Handholds and other climbing surfaces most often appear red.
[07:32.88]Like you can kind of just... Oh.
[07:40.16]I don't know.
[07:40.99]I feel like I'm going to fail this game fucking miserably.
[07:45.77]This is going to be a miserable failure.
[07:47.25]But whatever.
[07:48.15]It is what it is.
[07:50.52]You can hold crouch with the crouch button.
[07:53.73]Crouch and walk under the obstruction.
[08:01.22]Oh, alright.
[08:01.82]So you can hold on.
[08:02.54]Let me, if I hold.
[08:06.35]So you have to hold the button.
[08:07.55]I gotta hold these down.
[08:10.57]Okay, so go like this.
[08:14.18]Let's get down here and see.
[08:15.38]Okay, point to point.
[08:16.71]Climbing challenges often require traversing from point to point, handhold to handhold.
[08:23.78]Follow the handholds here and don't forget you can mantle on ledges.
[08:26.60]So you want to go like boink, boink, boink, boink, boink, boink.
[08:36.55]Okay.
[08:38.11]Oh, fuck.
[08:46.72]Okay, you can jump.
[08:48.04]Dude, you can jump.
[08:53.77]Alright, my brain needs to really get into its head.
[08:56.91]That, like, holding left, I move up, let, hold right, let go of left, go up, hold left, let go of right, hold right, let go of left, hold right, let go of left, hold left, let go of right.
[09:09.65]That's gonna be, okay.
[09:11.43]I'll get used to that.
[09:20.35]That's a lot for my brain.
[09:22.01]Alright, it's important to use momentum to your advantage.
[09:24.30]Jump to this hanging pole while readying your hands.
[09:28.18]Okay, once on it, swing back, then swing forward.
[09:38.08]Oops, I didn't do the swing part.
[09:47.69]Alright, swing back, swing forward, swing back.
[09:51.13]Got it.
[09:52.71]Alright.
[09:53.47]Note how your hands auto-grab the pole while readied.
[09:56.46]If you ever find yourself falling down, ready your hands and hope you can grab something in time.
[10:00.40]I think that deserves a coffee sip.
[10:08.05]Why do I have to tell you guys that?
[10:10.34]I don't know why I do that.
[10:16.66]Alright, yeah, so who cares about grabbing and swinging?
[10:19.30]Just jump.
[10:21.21]Don't forget you can mantle.
[10:28.20]Okay.
[10:28.80]Notice your hands will gradually turn red as you climb.
[10:31.14]Holding on surfaces will drain your stamina and you will lose your grip when your stamina runs out.
[10:35.13]Each hand will regain stamina when it's not holding onto something.
[10:38.55]Oh.
[10:43.80]Okay.
[10:47.93]Oh, fuck.
[10:49.61]Is it fall damage?
[10:54.32]Okay.
[10:58.40]Okay.
[10:59.57]Oh, shit.
[11:00.15]I got to go that way.
[11:00.97]Alright.
[11:01.25]Let me see if I can do this.
[11:11.38]Ooh.
[11:16.83]I think I'm learning.
[11:18.78]Cans of food restore stamina.
[11:21.18]Don't forget to toss the empty can after using it.
[11:25.10]How do you use it?
[11:27.61]Oh, and then you... You throw it?
[11:29.43]How do you throw it?
[11:32.77]How do I throw it down?
[11:33.39]How do I get rid of it?
[11:39.58]Okay, I want to get rid of the cans.
[11:40.66]How do I throw down the cans?
[11:42.70]Q and E. Oh, okay.
[11:45.23]Alright, let me read this shit.
[11:50.54]You can pick up an item by grabbing it with either hand.
[11:54.00]Use the item by pressing the hand button right.
[11:56.57]Store items in your inventory by holding tab.
[12:02.54]Click where you want to put them.
[12:07.88]Wait, what?
[12:08.85]How come I have gross cans?
[12:11.05]Okay, drop is one.
[12:17.40]Okay, so now Q is that.
[12:20.51]Alright, throw this away.
[12:24.19]Drop a hand by pressing 1 for your left hand and 3 for your right hand.
[12:26.85]Why 3?
[12:36.07]Okay.
[12:36.19]Bro, you wasted two of them.
[12:38.03]I thought it was just food to eat to tell you, hey, look, food is edible.
[12:41.27]I don't know.
[12:42.91]Alright, here we go.
[12:45.48]If you're carrying too many items, your inventory will start turning red.
[12:48.13]Picking up more items while encumbered slows you down for each extra item.
[12:55.54]Kittens let you create handholds, though until hammered in fully, they are not permanent and secure.
[13:01.04]Once placed in a wall, use the hammer to knock it in.
[13:04.43]Place them while climbing, but keep an eye on your stamina.
[13:09.42]Okay.
[13:11.00]Let's see if I want to put it right there.
[13:14.76]Oh shit, how do you hammer it in?
[13:17.14]Do I need a hammer?
[13:22.93]Is that in?
[13:24.87]Okay, it's three hits to get it in.
[13:28.98]How do I put the hammer away?
[13:36.45]Okay.
[13:38.51]You have to eat the hammer.
[13:39.37]Should I take some of these?
[13:41.83]I only have two inventory slots.
[13:54.48]Oh, shit.
[13:55.36]Okay, hold on.
[14:00.71]Like that?
[14:14.75]Okay.
[14:23.08]Fuck.
[14:23.58]Okay, I get it.
[14:31.88]Okay.
[14:32.88]Use your inventory while hanging and pull out a pitton while climbing.
[14:36.13]Swap hands when one gets tired and use the sprained hand to hammer in the next pitton.
[14:41.62]But I need to take food, don't I?
[14:44.02]Should I just eat this food?
[14:52.23]Alright, I'm gonna... How do you swap hands?
[15:02.71]Wait, what?
[15:03.67]Oh, fuck.
[15:04.27]Okay, how do I... Oh.
[15:06.51]Okay.
[15:09.16]I get it.
[15:11.04]So, is it... There's two things on cue now?
[15:14.45]How do I switch between them?
[15:23.70]I kind of get it.
[15:24.96]Alright, I guess I'm gonna... Shh.
[15:33.02]I don't know if I'm gonna be able to play this game.
[15:34.62]I don't know if I'm gonna be able to play this game.
[15:44.89]Okay.
[15:46.77]Shit, I need more of these.
[15:47.79]Can I fail the tutorial?
[16:00.78]I need a shitload of those.
[16:04.24]Can I pull this out?
[16:05.96]Give me this.
[16:11.58]Uh oh.
[16:12.10]I think I fucked up everything.
[16:14.75]I hammered them all in.
[16:17.79]Hey, I quit this game the first time I did pit and tutorial.
[16:20.35]You're good.
[16:21.03]Oh, okay.
[16:25.70]Uh, I don't know if I can get up there.
[16:27.02]I think I actually failed the tutorial.
[16:30.82]Can I actually still get up there?
[16:32.36]Let's find out.
[16:40.42]one up there.
[16:47.37]Okay, so it's gotta be... Damn it!
[16:49.83]I threw the fucking hammer!
[16:52.80]I have to get the hammer.
[16:56.34]Okay, it's E, not 3.
[16:58.04]E, not 3.
[16:58.81]Q and E. Oh my god!
[17:06.74]I'm losing my mind.
[17:07.86]Hold on.
[17:11.55]Hey, just be happy that I'm starting to get down the climbing.
[17:14.23]Alright, now.
[17:17.54]Q, toss that over here.
[17:20.46]Let's go like this.
[17:21.91]Oops.
[17:26.23]That's not even fucking close.
[17:27.92]I don't think I can do this.
[17:29.14]I think I actually failed.
[17:41.72]Okay, now I gotta hammer that in.
[17:53.04]Hey, this is Ster's payback for making him play viscera cleanup detail.
[17:56.54]That was like four years ago.
[17:58.48]Alright.
[17:59.00]No, this game is, I'm actually, I like it.
[18:04.95]There we go.
[18:05.53]Alright.
[18:05.91]All you thought I wasn't going to get out of the tutorial.
[18:07.49]Well, you were fucking wrong.
[18:12.08]Here we go.
[18:19.63]Yep.
[18:21.13]Okay.
[18:22.02]You have two pockets in your inventory represented by the circles on each side that you can store a single item in from each hand.
[18:29.59]You can place items in your pocket or pull items from it into your hands by hitting Q. Okay.
[18:38.68]Okay.
[18:42.12]So let's go like this.
[18:45.06]I can go... I can put those two over there.
[18:49.42]And then I can put this just like up here.
[18:54.33]Alright, so if I go... What if I do this?
[19:00.11]Hold on.
[19:04.90]How do I get the other one in the pocket?
[19:07.36]Wait, is it technically not in there?
[19:11.56]Is it too big that they both have to be able to fit?
[19:15.73]It can only be one item per hand.
[19:17.91]Only one per pocket.
[19:22.90]You cannot fit two.
[19:25.92]Oh, okay.
[19:26.62]Well, I mean, I knew that's what that was.
[19:28.64]Okay, well.
[19:30.64]Only one item.
[19:32.34]Alright.
[19:34.25]Let's go.
[19:35.11]What's that?
[19:35.93]What's that?
[19:36.19]There's a bug.
[19:36.83]There's a gold bug.
[19:40.17]What does that do?
[19:47.07]I just got a gold bug!
[19:55.34]How do I get over there?
[19:56.48]Do I just do this?
[20:10.06]I did it!
[20:11.36]Hammering.
[20:13.31]Your hammer can be used to break certain obstacles or objects.
[20:15.88]In a pinch, it can also be used as a weapon in the case of self-defense.
[20:19.26]Break through these boards with your hammer to continue.
[20:22.31]Hammer this.
[20:26.26]Oh, shit.
[20:26.76]Nice.
[20:28.60]How much stuff should I actually keep in my inventory, though?
[20:45.86]rebar rebar can be thrown to make a hand hold at a distance it will ricochet off of surfaces if you throw it at a shallow angle aim carefully be careful about throwing rebar when you're not on solid ground you will lose your grip on hand holds and be knocked back okay so we can throw rebar just left click I hope that worked it did okay
[21:13.98]Remember I told you that the ads got fucked up in the beginning.
[21:16.64]I don't think this is going to be three minutes.
[21:19.38]But it might be.
[21:21.36]So let me just take the minute or two here.
[21:23.23]Let's hope it's only like a minute.
[21:24.93]Because I already did the minute already.
[21:30.39]And then it should be good for like an hour and a half.
[21:34.52]Let's find out.
[21:36.18]I'm going to sit here and chill until it happens.
[21:39.02]Ah, there's a reset button too.
[21:39.97]Okay.
[21:47.84]I feel like you're playing Jigsaw.
[21:51.81]Why is my voice silky today?
[21:53.21]I don't know.
[21:53.49]It just is.
[21:53.95]But let's see what happens.
[21:55.30]I'm hoping for like a minute and a half.
[21:59.50]Because then I can just get my drink.
[22:01.43]I gotta run downstairs.
[22:04.51]Let's see.
[22:08.50]Look up.
[22:08.74]There's a shadow.
[22:09.42]I mean, there's shadows everywhere.
[22:16.16]I said look at this shadow here, shadow there, shadows on the ground.
[22:23.79]Alright, let's see.
[22:25.57]If so, I'll just pause for like a minute or two.
[22:26.75]It's fine.
[22:31.56]It's already been 20 minutes.
[22:33.96]You can tell I like a game because it's been 20 minutes and I'm like into it.
[22:44.54]You hate it?
[22:46.05]No, I don't.
[22:46.93]I really don't.
[22:52.29]Okay, so it's only one minute.
[22:53.92]It's 55 seconds, so we're just going to chill.
[22:57.00]And then we're good for another about hour or so.
[22:59.08]We're good.
[23:05.71]Give me one minute.
[23:06.73]Let me move this over here.
[23:11.04]Yeah, there we go.
[23:13.40]Okay.
[23:13.52]Now we're back on track.
[23:14.62]Things are good.
[23:18.83]And 30 seconds.
[23:28.90]Just got here.
[23:29.89]Welcome!
[23:30.97]I'm just doing the tutorial.
[23:36.90]I'm going to be locked in, I think, for this one for the long term.
[23:38.86]I'm looking forward to it.
[23:41.50]Hey, can you sing the welcome song?
[23:42.80]I will in five seconds when this ends.
[23:49.01]Alright, welcome back.
[23:51.47]Are we ready?
[23:52.05]Let's go.
[23:52.67]I didn't throw the other rebar.
[23:59.95]Can you throw rebar if?
[24:04.15]How far do you?
[24:04.77]How far can I throw the rebar?
[24:09.94]I guess it's pretty far.
[24:18.01]That's really far.
[24:19.66]But it is at an angle.
[24:20.92]Is that bad?
[24:21.40]Stop!
[24:23.02]I think he's here.
[24:25.76]Alright, let's go.
[24:29.49]Oh my god, that's not even fucking close.
[24:37.44]Okay, I need more of them.
[24:38.14]I need more of them.
[24:39.28]There's like four of them.
[24:40.04]Alright, yeah, there's plenty.
[24:40.70]There's plenty.
[24:48.25]Is that enough?

[25:11.22]Rope.
[25:11.87]Rope can be swung using WASD while looking horizontally.
[25:14.99]It can be climbed by looking vertically.
[25:16.61]Jumping off a rope while swinging will give you a boost.
[25:25.04]Okay.
[25:25.16]Nice.

[26:57.88]Okay.
[27:00.22]Uh, highest ascent.
[27:01.61]Oh, God.
[27:02.59]I'm going to be pretty low on this list.

[27:09.31]Escape.
[27:11.19]Run.
[27:13.88]Alright.
[27:14.10]They're starting us off with a rebar already.
[27:17.12]I'm going to store that.
[27:18.10]I learned this.
[27:20.50]Just go.
[27:21.12]Just climb up this.
[27:23.12]I learned a lot.
[27:36.82]That was really bad.
[27:38.48]That was really bad.
[27:40.40]My hands turned fucking purple.
[27:48.65]Hey, at least I made it up.
[27:56.65]Hey, I just beat level one in record time.
[27:59.59]I hear something.
[28:04.36]I hear like a monster.
[28:05.26]Is there a monster in this game?
[28:14.91]Caution.
[28:16.31]Automated defense systems may malfunction.
[28:20.25]Proceed with extreme caution in all areas.
[28:23.74]I broke a box.
[28:24.60]Relax.
[28:26.14]Oh shit, maybe I could use that for a little bit of a boost.
[28:29.37]Dude, look at that.
[28:30.53]That means I don't have to grab this one.
[28:33.09]I don't think Ster did that.
[28:37.10]Probably sitting there going like, oh fuck man, that's like an extra second of time I could save.
[28:42.05]Wait, there's two ways to go.
[28:46.85]I feel like that way looks safer than this way.
[28:48.96]Wait, there's three ways to go.
[28:50.74]Rose.
[28:52.08]Rose.
[28:54.20]Okay, what is that?
[29:00.30]Get out of here.
[29:03.92]I guess this one's not safe.
[29:06.75]I think I have to go now.
[29:07.79]Go.
[29:20.36]Oh, damn it.
[29:23.05]Stop it.
[29:28.53]Oh shit!
[29:31.54]In my fucking pants!
[29:33.84]I gotta get used to it.
[29:40.99]I gotta get used to it.
[29:41.71]I gotta get used to it.
[29:42.45]I gotta get used to it.
[29:55.69]What am I doing?
[29:56.57]I'm fine.
[30:00.36]Oh my God, I just hit my head.
[30:01.88]I made it.
[30:03.74]OK, let's see.
[30:05.02]Don't fuck with from here to there.
[30:08.95]From here to there.
[30:10.51]I guess I could go left wall, right?
[30:12.87]Why are you jumping every time?
[30:14.81]Should I not be?
[30:15.81]How do I just pull myself up?
[30:25.24]Hold W. And then just let like let go.
[30:37.60]Oh, holding W doesn't pull you up.
[30:51.61]Hold W and look up.
[30:53.05]Oh, bug!
[30:57.36]Ascend 50 meters.
[30:58.30]I just did it.
[31:00.76]What do I do about that bug?
[31:05.71]Oh, I get it.
[31:06.38]OK, cool.
[31:08.76]From here I gotta get to 50 meters.
[31:23.85]What if I go where?
[31:27.83]I made it.
[31:30.66]Kind of.
[31:40.61]Nice.
[31:42.80]Oh, my voice might be a little weird because I have a fan on and I have all my like doors and everything's open my whole I'm naked and shit.
[31:48.97]So I turn my noise filter thing on.
[31:51.13]So when I scream really loud, it might go.
[31:57.72]I had to.
[31:59.82]Okay, well, I made it up here.
[32:00.98]Can I open doors?
[32:03.49]Right at the middle, I think.
[32:10.16]Right in the middle.
[32:15.47]Yeah.
[32:15.59]Alright, I saw that monster.
[32:16.79]I don't know.
[32:17.37]Should I be afraid of that?
[32:18.13]I just made it.
[32:18.55]I did it.
[32:20.47]This game is pretty sick.
[32:27.04]OK, first real test here.
[32:34.11]I still have a rebar.
[32:37.87]I'm going to break some shit.
[32:49.97]Don't take too much stuff though, right?
[32:57.66]Ooh, another rebarb.
[33:01.21]At what point do I start to get too heavy?
[33:03.59]Huh?
[33:06.57]I'm sure it'll be red art.
[33:10.38]Alright, I'm gonna go this way.
[33:25.84]Cool.
[33:26.31]I think I'm getting it down.
[33:27.19]This game is kind of fun.
[33:31.99]Alright, so we get across that.
[33:34.84]I could throw a rebarb over there and just jump, right?
[33:45.02]Turn on your cam.
[33:45.84]I'm naked.
[33:46.78]I'm not turning a camera on while I'm naked.
[33:48.06]I'll get banned forever.
[33:58.30]I jumped.
[34:02.24]I freaked out.
[34:02.54]Wait, that's it?
[34:03.12]I lose?
[34:04.08]What are you talking about?
[34:04.84]I lose.
[34:05.66]I freaked out.
[34:06.47]I thought I could... What?
[34:07.49]I already lost.
[34:09.33]Oh, I have to restart the game?
[34:10.53]Wait, what the fuck happened?
[34:13.13]What killed me?
[34:13.93]How did I die?
[34:14.82]What's going on?
[34:19.36]What the fuck is this score?
[34:21.46]I got 22?
[34:22.04]He got... He has 25,000 points?
[34:27.02]25,000 points?
[34:28.86]I got 22 points?
[34:31.64]What the hell?
[34:34.86]What?
[34:35.22]I have to restart the whole game?
[34:36.48]Oh, fuck!
[34:38.45]Oh my god!
[34:39.33]I don't want to do that!
[34:40.19]Oh, I was making so much- I was making so much progress!
[34:45.01]I'll give you fucking points.
[34:46.25]Hmm.
[34:56.28]Okay.
[34:58.34]Did I skip a bunch of items?
[34:59.88]Uh-oh.
[35:05.09]What even killed me?
[35:06.19]I don't even know what killed me, honestly.
[35:08.01]22 is better than zero.
[35:11.43]Yeah, but I don't even... What happened?
[35:17.64]Ugh, okay.
[35:19.03]Does it change?
[35:20.17]This is a different... This is a different map.
[35:27.12]This shit's different.
[35:28.90]It was the goop, you idiot.
[35:30.36]What goop?
[35:41.51]Oh, shit.
[35:42.03]Okay, hold on.
[35:47.64]Okay, I gotta make it up there.
[35:53.85]Uh, alright.
[35:54.25]Let me put... I feel like I'm gonna need it.
[35:58.34]Maybe to get up... Oh my god, that's so far.
[36:02.11]I could do rebarb there and go up in there.
[36:04.66]I could do... I'm gonna go for it.
[36:09.33]Get this rebarb right there.
[36:10.91]Can I get it?
[36:11.67]I don't know.
[36:12.61]I gotta go.
[36:26.27]I don't know, bros.
[36:27.01]I'm starting to get a little tired.
[36:32.76]I made it.
[36:36.17]I got a bug.
[36:43.74]Can I take this with me?
[36:47.33]Oh, was that a secret?
[36:47.99]Was that important?
[36:48.87]I hope not.
[36:57.79]Okay.
[36:59.68]Uh... Uh... Ah!
[37:07.71]What?
[37:08.01]I don't know.
[37:10.99]Where do I go?
[37:14.39]Okay.
[37:15.39]Um... Now let's go...
[37:27.29]I think this is a pretty good shot right here.
[37:29.16]To get up there.
[37:30.18]To get up that lip.
[37:31.70]I can't believe I just walked off the edge.
[37:33.66]I'm fine.
[37:40.13]Okay.
[37:40.25]Okay, maybe I should think about this for another few seconds.
[37:43.08]What am I doing?
[37:46.14]The goop is coming?
[37:46.93]I don't see any goop.
[37:47.97]We're fine.
[37:49.79]I just gotta climb normally.
[37:57.85]Okay.
[37:59.21]Then... I gotta make it around there.
[38:02.62]I gotta go this way.
[38:04.24]And then up.
[38:05.12]Fuck, that's so much.
[38:06.56]Without a stop.
[38:07.56]I have an idea.
[38:08.90]Here's my idea.
[38:09.82]Rebar.
[38:11.69]Boink.
[38:17.29]Use it.
[38:18.79]I can't use it?
[38:21.56]How do I use this?
[38:24.34]It's too big for your pocket.
[38:25.96]Oh.
[38:26.18]Oh.
[38:26.98]Okay.
[38:28.16]Now, I'm thinking like right there.
[38:31.96]Bingo.
[38:33.21]Then, check this out.
[38:43.46]Can I pull it out?
[38:44.88]Oops.
[38:45.30]That was a bad idea.
[38:46.40]I thought that- Okay, let's go.
[38:50.23]Oh shit, there is goop.
[38:51.01]I gotta go.
[38:52.11]I gotta go.
[38:52.51]I gotta go.
[38:52.89]I gotta go.
[38:53.33]Up that way.
[38:54.55]Actually, this may have actually helped.
[38:59.65]Okay, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah,

[39:33.01]Good.
[39:33.61]Ooh.
[39:33.93]Okay, we're fine.
[39:35.06]Anything else to do?
[39:35.88]Remember that?
[39:39.40]Alright, this game's pretty fun.
[39:40.08]What do you do with the bugs?
[39:46.89]I have so much food, too.
[39:47.87]Don't forget that.
[39:48.43]I gotta use it.
[39:50.47]Okay.
[39:51.22]Where am I going here?
[39:52.94]Eat the bug?
[39:56.02]Eat it.
[39:56.52]Eat the bug.
[40:01.26]How do I eat it?
[40:05.67]Eat bug.
[40:06.31]Bugs are money.
[40:08.13]Eat bugs.
[40:09.07]No, don't eat it.
[40:11.69]Stop jumping until you get better.
[40:13.18]Laughing my ass off, said Ster.
[40:18.44]Oh, alright.
[40:21.01]Hit me with the LMAO.
[40:22.61]Alright, alright, alright.
[40:27.08]I immediately jumped.
[40:45.61]Pretty good.
[40:47.39]Alright.
[40:48.93]Uh, check this out.
[40:53.58]Bug!
[41:09.82]What just happened there?
[41:10.51]Why couldn't I climb that?
[41:24.71]Alright, I'm 150 meters.
[41:26.63]I'm going crazy right now.
[41:28.47]Oh God.
[41:34.82]OK, we got rebar and whatever this is.
[41:38.92]Climber, I saw you no more pills.
[41:41.11]Everything fades.
[41:41.85]What have we done in their home?
[41:44.13]Meet with the mother.
[41:45.23]She is kind.
[41:48.17]OK.

[42:04.96]Goop is coming.
[42:05.58]Goop is coming.
[42:06.38]Goop is coming.
[42:07.10]What do I do?
[42:09.81]Oh, my god.
[42:10.43]I didn't know that.
[42:11.03]I didn't know that's what that was.
[42:12.37]Okay, hold on.

[42:44.29]Just slowly get up here.
[42:51.22]We made it.
[42:51.73]Good.
[42:57.35]This inventory is a piece of shit, by the way.
[43:07.05]We've got to move some stuff around big time.
[43:09.53]Bugs in the lower right.
[43:11.61]Food at the top.
[43:14.10]Things to hammer down here in the lower left.
[43:17.06]Note.
[43:18.12]Do I even need this?
[43:19.62]How do I get rid of this?
[43:22.71]The goop is coming?
[43:24.06]Oh, okay.
[43:25.38]Oh god, I gotta go.

[43:41.86]Oh my god, what's wrong with me?
[43:43.99]Oh my god, please, just stop!
[43:49.15]Is that enough?
[43:50.62]I hope it is.
[43:53.85]Yep.
[43:54.43]Okay.
[43:58.77]Good.
[43:59.27]Alright.

[44:11.27]Caution.
[44:12.67]Alright.
[44:13.57]Where are we going from here?
[44:14.81]That way.
[44:15.17]Fluctuating pressure detected in air exchange regulator valves.
[44:17.74]Stand clear of all intake vents during adjustments.
[44:22.98]Can I open this door?
[44:24.88]Alright, what about this way?
[44:26.32]I think we're going to... Okay, rebarb up to top of that.
[44:29.71]We got to go boink up.
[44:32.91]Then we're going to have to boink it over there.
[44:36.04]Yeah, we're going to have to go for a boink right now.
[44:38.50]In 3, 2, 1.
[44:41.58]I boinked it.

[44:52.50]I forgot.
[44:53.94]Yeah.
[45:00.28]Okay, well, 68... How do you even get this?

[45:14.20]Just kind of get your ass up here.
[45:20.69]No thinking.
[45:21.31]Just go.
[45:27.10]Looks like you're trying to climb out of the kitchen sink.
[45:28.71]That might be what the game is.
[45:32.95]Take another Rebarb, that's good.
[45:35.12]Alright, just go.
[45:36.40]Wait, wait.
[45:39.73]Ster said he would... He said, I would shit my pants if you got to, like, Act 3.
[45:44.41]I don't know what that means.

[48:41.01]I think I can just do it.
[48:45.88]Can I just do it from here?
[48:47.12]I think so.
[48:51.66]Yep.

[53:09.44]That's a long way to go, isn't it?
[53:13.21]I'm going the safer route.
[53:27.16]Yeah, that's way too far to climb.
[53:28.85]I don't think I could have done it.
[53:30.09]Oh, I'm in some trouble here.
[53:31.15]Hold on.
[53:41.79]We good still?

[53:53.56]Go.
[54:03.49]Oh fuck!
[54:04.07]This is way too high!
[54:05.34]This is way too high!
[54:06.36]Don't freak out, I got one hand still.
[54:09.08]Whoa!
[54:10.66]That was so high!
[54:13.57]I misjudged that so, so badly.
[54:15.59]Okay, we're good?
[54:20.50]Um...
[54:25.18]Shit, let's get over there first.
[54:27.12]Let's get over there first.
[54:42.70]Good.
[54:43.52]Alright, we're ahead of the game here.
[54:45.64]That was probably dumb.
[54:55.84]No, maybe not.
[54:56.92]That just makes it easier.
[55:00.79]Yeah, actually helpful.
[55:06.04]Best ascent.
[55:06.94]I did it!
[55:07.28]At 0.6 milliseconds.
[55:10.14]Do you see how fast I'm going?
[55:11.41]0.6 milliseconds.
[55:15.17]My brain is going too fast.
[55:29.52]Okay, uh, let's go.
[55:34.64]So, do you activate the goop after you go a certain height from here, or is it just always going and moving?
[55:39.59]Always.
[55:39.87]It's always going, okay.
[55:58.34]Fuck.
[55:58.46]Oh my god.
[55:59.95]Okay.
[56:00.17]This is the first time I've been.
[56:02.73]Kind of?
[56:03.63]Maybe.
[56:07.86]That was such a coward move.
[56:23.60]This is actually a coward move, what I just did.
[56:28.92]Or was it?
[56:31.30]Save this.
[56:44.18]I so badly want... Okay.
[56:48.67]Alright, I'm good.
[56:52.02]Let's go.
[56:55.24]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[56:58.95]I need one of these up there.
[57:10.04]Yep, oxygen is low.
[57:16.45]Breathing apparatus?
[57:18.87]What?
[57:20.90]I don't care about the bugs.
[57:24.76]Yep.
[57:38.35]Just don't think, go.
[57:40.60]The less I think about what I'm doing, the better.
[57:42.56]Okay, easy.
[57:52.09]Slow it down.
[57:58.88]I got the rope still.
[58:06.83]It's just a coward move to just use it right here.
[58:08.65]Whatever.
[58:09.09]As far as I've been.
[58:09.73]I don't care.
[58:23.27]Use it or lose it.
[58:23.85]It's true.
[58:26.13]I completely... I got a lot of items though.
[58:27.61]I think I'm alright.
[58:31.38]I got a lot to work with.
[58:34.38]Okay.
[58:36.83]What's the best place to start here?
[58:37.81]Probably go this way.
[58:40.25]Okay, I'll tell you what I love about this game.
[58:41.71]I do love the ability to... Hold on.
[58:48.38]You kind of have to make... You got to make some decisions.
[58:52.82]You know what I'm saying?
[58:56.89]I love...
[59:00.37]Sorry, I gotta do this.
[59:28.72]Oh fuck, it's over.
[59:29.70]It's over.
[59:29.92]It's not over.
[59:30.22]It's not over.
[59:30.52]It's not over.
[59:30.82]It's not over.
[59:31.24]I know what to do.
[59:31.89]Not over.
[59:32.13]It's not over.
[59:34.55]Oh shit, it's over.
[59:35.51]Is it over?
[59:36.69]It's over.
[59:37.07]It's over.
[59:39.01]No, it's not.
[59:39.59]No, it's not.
[59:48.32]No, it's not.
[59:49.90]It's over.

[60:41.23]What do I do about that guy?
[60:42.72]Do I throw a rebar about him?
[60:46.64]Yep.
[60:48.58]Does he have items or anything I can get, or is it just... you just kill?
[60:59.96]Can I pick him up?
[61:04.67]Oh, that was a mistake, but it's okay.
[61:12.27]Uh-oh.
[61:12.79]Yep, right there.
[61:15.15]Looking good.
[61:18.22]Wait for the hands.
[61:29.59]Alright, I need items.
[61:30.67]I have nothing.
[61:31.56]I kind of just went tunnel vision and just went nuts.
[61:38.99]Alright, items.
[61:39.73]I need them.
[61:44.95]Any items?
[61:50.65]Are there items in chests or no?
[61:59.33]I think I just gotta go.
[62:00.99]I gotta go for it.
[62:02.38]How's it gonna go?
[62:04.11]OK.
[62:05.91]I just gotta go.
[62:06.80]Yeah, I have to do it.
[62:08.04]There's nowhere else to go.
[62:09.77]I gotta do it.
[62:11.67]I gotta go for it.
[62:12.94]I have to go.
[62:14.64]I have to.
[62:14.98]I have to do it now.
[62:16.19]Go I have to do it go.
[62:35.36]Okay.
[62:37.48]Everyone's cool.
[62:38.13]We're just chilling.
[62:40.25]I have to do some gymnastics bullshit to get up there?
[62:42.27]Oh, no.
[62:47.62]I knew that was going to... I was going to say just like Home Alone.
[62:51.19]When he grabs the thing that's oiled and he goes... He lands right on his back with the green goo that's on it.
[63:02.36]Two buttons.
[63:08.51]Tons of items up here, thank God.
[63:14.50]And you can drink... You can do the Popeye spinach while you're climbing, right?
[63:22.64]Oh, boy.
[63:23.08]Okay.
[63:30.71]Sometimes you just got to do the quick one.
[63:33.11]Okay.
[63:35.52]What was that sound?
[63:36.94]I'm going to go this way.
[63:38.14]Just got to go.
[63:38.76]Go for it.
[63:39.26]Do it.
[63:52.32]Okay.
[63:52.96]Okay.
[63:53.62]Everybody relax.
[63:54.36]My mouse just unplugged and replugged in.
[63:57.49]I don't know how.
[64:00.09]That would have that was almost a complete fucking disaster.
[64:08.40]Yep, don't need to put the items.
[64:12.32]Just go this way.
[64:13.11]Make it clean though.
[64:14.13]Nice and clean.
[64:17.03]Very clean good.
[64:18.69]We're going to make our way.
[64:21.67]Up there and then across.
[64:23.23]Okay, I can get up to that lip.
[64:24.54]Let's get the rebarb out there now.
[64:27.00]I don't have a rebarb, you fucking idiot.
[64:29.98]I'm going to get a Popeye spinach immediately because I feel like I'm going to use it.
[64:34.31]I think I can get it with just jumps and with Popeye spinach.
[64:49.72]Oh, I don't even need the spinach.
[64:50.78]Let's go.
[64:51.96]Ooh, this is uh, uh oh.
[64:58.71]It was so stressful.
[65:07.38]Okay, where we at?
[65:14.45]Let me see, get up there.
[65:16.39]I'm just gonna go for the climb, let's do it.
[65:20.62]Good.
[65:21.82]Then, I don't think I need anything up here.
[65:23.86]Wait, I might actually need something right there.
[65:27.62]No, I don't.
[65:28.36]No, fuck it.
[65:28.80]We can do it.
[65:33.75]We're good.
[65:34.37]Okay.
[65:40.94]This could be... Hmm.
[65:45.22]This is dangerous, but I think I can go for it.
[65:47.30]Yep, let's do it.
[65:48.18]I'm gonna go like this.
[65:54.15]There.
[65:56.67]What are you doing?
[66:02.04]Okay.
[66:03.53]Alright, are we good to do this in one go?
[66:11.62]Maybe.
[66:12.34]I think so.
[66:16.05]Okay, got it.
[66:20.47]No, no, no, no, no, yeah.
[66:27.46]Float down.
[66:37.25]Good, OK, same deal.

[66:56.43]Okay, good.
[66:57.81]I'm thinking, ooh, rope.
[66:59.35]Big.
[67:00.04]Massive.
[67:00.76]Absolutely huge.
[67:02.44]Don't need it right now, though.
[67:07.33]You know what?
[67:07.73]Fuck it.
[67:10.40]Fuck this.
[67:24.51]Skip all that shit.
[67:26.50]Skip all that shit.
[67:28.36]Okay.
[67:36.68]This time I'm not going to screw this one up.
[67:39.02]We're going to go boink.
[67:41.02]Then we're going to go another boink.
[67:43.35]Because last time this is where I failed.
[67:44.81]Visorably.
[67:47.23]Boink.
[67:48.00]Okay.
[67:48.24]Just hammer that in.
[67:53.74]That's in.
[67:54.28]Go.
[67:59.55]Got it.
[68:01.37]Okay.
[68:01.55]Good.
[68:02.75]Perfect.
[68:05.24]Right there.
[68:13.73]I feel like I'm delivering a couch.
[68:15.41]Okay.
[68:15.65]Right there.
[68:16.25]Perfect.
[68:17.00]Turn it.
[68:17.52]Good.
[68:18.20]Okay.
[68:18.60]Corner.
[68:21.94]I have so much food.
[68:23.86]I need to use this stuff.
[68:24.86]I'm afraid to have something in my hands though.
[68:27.43]What's that?
[68:28.03]What?
[68:29.07]Okay.
[68:31.75]Um, what does that do?
[68:41.29]It's a brick?
[68:43.73]Alright, I got a brick.
[68:46.08]I can make that jump, right?
[68:49.83]Come on, I gotta get that.
[68:51.86]I gotta do it right.
[69:01.17]What's that?
[69:03.03]What's that?
[69:04.13]What is this?
[69:06.10]Is it a battery?
[69:09.70]Okay, uh... Big mistake.
[69:12.91]Oh my god, go!
[69:13.91]Oh my god.
[69:15.19]Oh my god.

[69:32.73]Oh my god.
[69:33.11]Fuck!
[69:33.61]No!
[69:34.75]No!
[69:35.62]I fucking freaked out.
[69:37.26]Oh, I'm so pissed right now.
[69:41.44]Why did I go the wrong way?
[69:42.83]I could have... Shit, that was a good run too.
[69:49.34]I was doing so well.
[69:57.38]It just, I got locked in.
[69:59.43]I could have probably just gone the other way.
[70:01.76]Shit.
[70:04.70]Alright, this game is fucking awesome though.
[70:06.19]I love this game.
[70:07.47]Derp was right.
[70:27.17]Believers always win.
[70:29.15]I don't know what they were believing in.
[70:31.51]Please, when you tab and grab something, it's already in your hand.
[70:33.96]You don't have to hit Q and E. Oh.
[70:43.07]Okay, right.
[70:48.08]Ster is screaming at his computer.
[70:49.92]Okay.
[70:50.34]Alright.
[70:51.10]Alright.
[70:51.38]Alright.
[70:51.64]I got to go.
[70:54.27]Hey, Ster.
[70:55.29]One's for you.

[71:27.20]Hmm.
[71:41.17]Okay.
[71:43.68]Whoa!
[71:43.82]Can I stand on this?
[71:45.02]Okay.
[71:45.59]Relax.
[71:46.87]Goop is coming.
[71:47.62]We got plenty of time.
[72:12.18]Yep.
[72:19.98]Yep.
[72:22.02]Yep.
[72:24.47]That show is fucking so stupid.
[72:29.54]Okay.
[72:40.35]Nothing to work with here.
[72:42.85]Dog shit seed.
[72:45.59]Nothing to work with?
[72:47.07]Ugh, seed sucks.
[72:55.88]Dude, what is with this dog shit seed?
[73:06.89]Okay, don't do that again.
[73:23.17]I'm good.
[73:27.26]That was the luckiest fucking thing in my whole life.
[73:43.34]It looks that scary, but I have to do it.
[73:47.48]I can't get over there again.
[73:48.88]I have to go.
[74:04.08]Okay.
[74:06.20]Can we get some pogs in the chat for what I just did?
[74:07.96]That was difficult.
[74:10.79]Okay.
[74:11.25]I was stressing me out a little.
[74:14.85]Uh, right here.
[74:18.42]I mean, I have to be honest, guys.
[74:19.80]I've looked over.
[74:20.36]I have seen maybe like 10% pog to, to omega load ratio.
[74:24.25]And that's like really not okay.
[74:26.53]Okay.
[74:27.43]It's not okay.
[74:29.83]What the fuck?
[74:35.89]Alright, I'm gonna go this way.
[74:39.91]Gold bug, who gives a shit?
[74:42.04]Shove it up your ass.
[74:44.06]That's bait.
[74:52.75]I just smashed my hand.
[74:53.81]In this guy's real life, he just hurt his hand so bad.
[74:59.14]I smoked it on the edge there.
[75:01.14]I have a cut and everything after that.
[75:04.49]Environmental sensors in habitation reporting nominal radiation levels.
[75:10.96]No cause for concern.
[75:13.52]Shit, this is going to be wacky.
[75:14.98]What do I got?
[75:18.57]I could just skip it.
[75:19.13]Do not climb on that.
[75:20.45]Don't tell me what to fucking do.
[75:28.86]Um, what the fuck?
[75:36.67]I don't think I could reach it.
[75:37.45]Is it too far?
[75:42.64]I got it.
[75:47.76]Don't climb on that.
[75:48.59]Don't tell me what to do.
[75:57.29]Alright, what next?
[76:00.26]You gotta be careful you don't screw yourself.
[76:02.78]By picking the wrong side without enough items.
[76:14.61]Can I jump to the ladder from here?
[76:15.85]Maybe if I get right there.
[76:16.89]Yep.
[76:18.50]Alright.
[76:18.74]That ladder seems kind of safe, but we're not doing safety.
[76:23.51]We're going for fucking PogChamps.
[76:24.89]We're not going for like, ooh, nice work.
[76:27.02]We're going for PogChamps.
[76:28.38]Are you kidding me?
[76:44.98]What's this guy's problem?
[76:56.44]I'm having a great time.
[76:57.60]What are you talking about?
[77:00.02]I do got to move though.
[77:00.70]This is way longer than I thought it was going to be.
[77:05.93]Nobody move.
[77:06.23]What do I do?
[77:06.85]What do I do?
[77:07.91]What do I do?
[77:08.51]I don't know what to do.
[77:09.91]I don't know what to do.
[77:12.70]Okay.
[77:15.64]Containment breach.
[77:18.97]This is stupid!
[77:25.22]Okay.
[77:33.10]This way, Safer.
[77:43.46]Okay, good.
[77:44.04]Just keep rolling.
[77:46.29]There's got to be some kind of new world record for me.
[77:50.14]250?
[77:50.66]Alright, we're good.
[77:52.18]Alright, slow it down.
[77:54.22]What's the best course of action?
[77:55.69]How far is that?
[77:57.15]I already know what I'm doing.
[78:02.48]Oh, shit.
[78:04.12]Okay, well, that's going to be a problem.
[78:06.87]Maybe.
[78:07.67]Oh, boy.
[78:07.93]Okay.
[78:22.20]Come on, you son of a bitch.
[78:37.22]Oh, my hand's a little cartoon red, but we're good.
[78:44.70]Okay, nice.
[78:51.76]I probably could have climbed up that without any problem at all.
[78:55.85]But, you know, you know how it is.
[78:59.38]Best ascent lost.
[79:00.60]What?
[79:02.64]I just got a new record.
[79:03.95]Oh, that feels good.
[79:04.75]Okay.
[79:10.86]Dude, I keep getting new world records for myself.
[79:13.82]That's awesome.
[79:14.46]Alright, don't let it get to your head.
[79:18.22]Oh, please not.
[79:22.18]No, stop, stop, stop, relax.
[79:28.50]I gotta go.
[79:29.06]Stop laughing and fucking play.
[79:48.75]Alright, slow it down, slow down for a second.
[79:50.83]What's the best place to go here?
[79:57.40]I'm going to say this way.
[80:03.79]Notice all personnel entering long term storage silo three must log container inventory to maintain accurate records.
[80:13.72]I got to the break room.
[80:16.29]This is an actual break room.
[80:17.79]Is it truly a break room?
[80:22.56]It's not just not coming behind me.
[80:25.92]Oh hell yeah, alright.
[80:31.37]What do I want?
[80:32.05]What do I want to do?
[80:32.91]I guess I got two coin bugs.
[80:36.33]I gotta redo this inventory.
[80:41.47]Perfect timing.
[80:41.99]I got an average coming up here so I can take it.
[80:44.48]I'm gonna go pee.
[80:48.61]Deposit them.
[80:51.77]What do you get for it?
[80:55.34]One.
[80:58.38]Two.
[80:58.80]I guess I could do a... I could get a can of spinach?
[81:04.71]Do I have to spend it or is this roguelike?
[81:07.15]Can I just keep them in there?
[81:13.82]Okay.
[81:17.41]They stay.
[81:18.13]Oh, cool.
[81:19.47]Okay.
[81:21.52]So this is a mess.
[81:23.64]Let's get this figured out.
[81:26.88]I think that having these around the same area is a good idea.
[81:32.39]How far?
[81:32.77]Okay.
[81:32.99]I was gonna say, how far away can you put them?
[81:35.41]Although this might get kind of ugly.
[81:37.10]Hold on.
[81:38.06]Let me fix this.
[81:42.22]Okay.
[81:42.44]We're doing rebar, but top, uh, spinach down the bottom.
[81:49.22]And then... I'm going to put these all in the same... This might seem kind of dumb, but I don't care.
[81:56.89]These all need to be right in the same spot.
[82:00.19]You know what I'm saying?
[82:02.72]I lost my best ascent?
[82:03.60]Why?
[82:04.78]Alright, I got a nap break coming.
[82:05.72]I'm going to take it.
[82:07.58]And I'll be back in a few minutes.
[82:08.66]We'll keep going.
[82:09.64]See you in a few.
[82:15.41]Beerby?
[87:23.35]Hello.
[87:25.05]I am back.
[87:25.99]I am ready.
[87:30.53]I have... I have my coffee.
[87:35.50]And I'm good.
[87:37.08]Alright.
[87:37.90]So.
[87:40.14]Okay.
[87:41.27]I'm at a break area here.
[87:42.41]I got plenty... Oh my god, I got a lot of good stuff.
[87:46.09]Alright, I'm ready.
[87:48.15]So, sir, is that, um...
[87:51.07]Is this still Act 1 or did I do Act 1?
[87:59.66]Is this still Act 1?
[88:00.68]Okay.
[88:03.06]There are a couple... I saw a bug.
[88:06.55]Bug right there.
[88:07.05]Let me get it.
[88:07.43]If I go up, am I going to activate this?
[88:10.99]Probably.
[88:18.92]Get over here.
[88:20.72]Devon chat.
[88:22.63]Oh.
[88:28.92]Uh, your games really fun.
[88:31.46]Oh shit, I gotta go.
[88:34.88]Local authority interactive 983 training initiatives in the deep substructure.
[88:43.72]Let's lock it in.
[88:46.12]Ooh, I like this is my game right here.
[88:53.56]This is my game right here.
[89:04.50]Potion.
[89:05.73]Uh-oh.
[89:09.64]I can't fuck this up.
[89:11.92]I can't fuck this up.
[89:20.61]I'm gonna avoid all that.
[89:22.85]Can't fuck it up.
[89:24.62]Gotta give yourself the confidence.
[89:27.04]Don't mess it up.
[89:39.11]Okay.
[89:40.50]Don't mess it up.
[89:43.12]Alright, easy.
[89:44.48]Check this out.
[89:45.26]Ooh, boink.
[89:46.64]Alright, we're gonna get a boink right here.
[89:50.48]And then, we're gonna get a second boink.
[89:55.23]Is that stupid?
[89:56.39]Probably.
[90:05.00]Nope.
[90:09.14]Hey, I'm going for a PB right now, guys.
[90:14.53]Alright.
[90:14.71]Left side looks way better.
[90:16.31]But...
[90:18.32]This could be a problem.
[90:19.85]I'm going to go with a small boink.
[90:22.67]Do we need a boink?
[90:23.94]No, we don't.
[90:25.74]Yeah, we do.
[90:28.89]Oh, oh!
[90:34.60]What?
[90:34.82]The music just got scary.
[90:46.39]Why is the music getting so scary?
[90:47.87]Does that mean the... Oh my God.
[90:55.66]No!
[90:56.70]I couldn't grab it.
[90:58.02]Oh, what happened?
[90:59.40]What just happened?
[91:00.49]I took too long.
[91:01.51]What happened?
[91:04.25]I couldn't grab that shit.
[91:11.16]Whatever, it's fine.
[91:15.65]I guess I was... I had to put like a blink in.
[91:17.99]I just didn't... Dude, that music was freaking me the fuck out.
[91:21.16]I was like, why am I hearing this already?
[91:22.56]Okay, how long before when you hear the music?
[91:33.70]You've got like, what, five seconds?
[91:35.06]I feel like it was right behind me.
[91:38.93]We can get there again.
[91:39.55]I gotta do it again.
[91:40.75]Let's go.
[91:57.73]Keep going.
[91:58.13]Keep going.
[91:58.50]Let's go.
[91:59.06]Bang.
[91:59.42]Remember when this was kind of scary to us?
[92:15.11]All the way around, I think.
[92:16.86]Nope.
[92:17.24]Boink.
[92:18.78]Get a boink right there.
[92:20.40]Oh.
[92:24.43]It's alright.
[92:29.58]I think this one's a wash.
[92:30.92]This one might be fine.
[92:32.08]I may have screwed this one bad.
[92:36.42]I'm freaking out now.
[92:37.16]Now I'm just freaking out.
[92:38.48]And the... After that last one, I... Let's turn it around right now.
[93:10.45]OK.
[93:13.11]Started around right now.
[93:18.88]Caution automated defense systems may malfunction.
[93:24.25]Proceed with extreme caution.
[93:26.47]No reason to freak out.
[93:30.50]Turned it around.
[93:40.62]Don't eat items, just keep going.
[93:58.91]Good.
[94:00.03]Alright, let's take a quick second.
[94:01.81]These things usually screw with me.
[94:02.97]I feel like I can get up there in one go.
[94:05.34]Let's try it.
[94:06.18]Yep.
[94:13.07]Oh, hold on.
[94:14.43]Don't get in the way.
[94:15.98]Looking good.
[94:21.53]Easy feasy.
[94:22.95]What's this?
[94:24.39]Secret?
[94:25.77]No.
[94:27.82]Oh.
[94:28.88]Wait.
[94:32.27]This is bait.
[94:33.19]That's bait, I think.
[94:33.89]I don't have anything to climb up that with.
[94:35.65]Got to get a rebar up there.
[94:41.20]Good.
[94:55.09]Rope, perfect.
[94:56.87]Good to get.
[94:57.23]I was just fucking narrating everything.
[95:02.64]I don't have to narrate what's happening, you know what I mean?
[95:10.87]What happened?
[95:11.63]Where am I?
[95:12.69]Where am I?
[95:13.95]I don't even know what's going on.
[95:18.16]Guys, I don't know what's happening.
[95:20.12]I need this... Oh, it's because there's a hole in this.
[95:23.32]Alright, I got it.
[95:29.79]Wait, items.
[95:33.56]Nothing.
[95:33.96]Alright.
[95:34.98]I like this setup over here better.
[95:46.15]How did I?
[96:05.79]Okay.
[96:05.99]God damn it.
[96:14.68]Keep going.
[96:16.31]Alright, 150.
[96:17.05]We're almost halfway to where we just were.
[96:20.14]I'm confident that this one will be sick.
[96:22.70]You know what I mean?
[96:25.19]Alright, we need some... We need something here.
[96:35.14]I'm gonna go for... Yep.
[96:36.88]Yep.
[96:37.39]Yep.
[96:37.59]Yep.
[96:37.69]Yep.
[96:37.79]Whatever you say.
[96:39.17]Don't go to the lab.
[96:40.43]Sure thing.
[96:41.59]I won't.
[96:51.97]Is it enough to get up there?
[96:58.44]Might be.
[97:00.18]It is not.
[97:00.86]Let's go ahead and get this situated.
[97:10.77]Right there looks good.
[97:18.75]Good.
[97:20.07]Ooh, another cookie bug.
[97:21.57]Excellent.
[97:22.33]That's three cookie bugs so far.
[97:23.93]This run is fucking fucked, dude.
[97:34.39]This might be a mistake.
[97:36.33]But, whatever.
[97:39.94]Nope, okay.
[97:42.24]Dude, four cookie bugs?
[97:44.46]Cooked.
[98:05.63]Wait.
[98:13.22]Okay.
[98:15.12]Um... Interesting.
[98:18.95]Okay, this is where I'm gonna need to use the rope.
[98:26.10]I didn't... I almost thought I didn't get it.
[98:31.14]Okay.
[98:31.26]Okay.
[98:37.77]Think, think fast.
[98:38.60]Think fast.
[98:39.36]It's over.
[98:39.78]This is good.
[98:40.50]It's good.
[98:41.57]Oh, how come I can't climb the whole rope?
[98:45.82]Can I not climb the whole?
[98:46.86]What am I doing wrong with the rope?
[98:49.84]Can I... Do I... Because when I look up, do I have to physically do it?
[98:55.27]Because when I was looking up, I was kind of shimmying with both hands, so I have to do it to... Shit.
[98:59.94]Okay.
[99:00.76]That's alright.
[99:01.48]That was a wash.
[99:02.04]It's fine.
[99:02.99]That one was a fucked up run anyways.
[99:04.31]That was cooked from the beginning.
[99:05.65]You guys know what I'm talking about.
[99:07.18]That run was fucking fucked.
[99:19.39]You lost four cookie bugs, I know.
[99:22.39]Trust me, I think about it every day.
[99:25.78]I think about that every day.
[99:28.01]There's two.
[99:34.62]Get him back right now.
[99:52.92]I got one.
[100:01.29]Dude, it's a little too risky what you're doing.
[100:03.17]I got it.
[100:03.81]Don't worry.
[100:06.14]Think about the risk-reward ratio here, Jeremy.
[100:08.48]I don't know about this.
[100:10.70]Look, you can fucking take it up with me if I lose, okay?
[100:17.45]notice I don't air quality in deep substructure within acceptable limits ventilation maintenance schedule to be announced got it things are going good wait I want that that's too good to not get
[100:43.88]Uh-oh.
[100:44.64]What have I done?
[100:46.06]Did I fuck the whole thing up?
[100:47.12]I might have.
[100:48.85]I have to go right now.
[100:57.65]Okay, then... I'm going to be safe about this.
[101:00.84]I'm not going to be an idiot.
[101:06.26]Yeah, we're good.
[101:06.98]Okay.
[101:09.91]Haha.
[101:20.40]Alright, good start.
[101:24.28]I got a rope.
[101:27.98]I got two.
[101:29.31]What are these things called jammers?
[101:35.43]Think I have to use one of them here.
[101:38.09]Which I do OK.
[101:47.26]The ladder the ladder.
[101:51.63]Let's be goofy with this, huh?
[101:55.36]Yep.
[102:15.34]I got a deposit to make.
[102:19.49]I got one right here already.
[102:23.12]Alright, uh, this side looks cool.
[102:26.71]That side looks cooler.
[102:37.37]Don't be stupid about this.
[102:44.04]Looking good.
[102:52.52]I'll tell you, okay, so the controls of this game are A+.
[102:59.21]Games like these, if you don't have an A-plus control scheme, the game kind of has a chance to suck.
[103:06.69]That's not the case here.
[103:13.50]Nothing in these.
[103:17.13]The controls are amazing.
[103:18.29]This is probably the best controlled game in this genre that I've played, period.
[103:23.37]I don't feel like the game is fighting against me.
[103:25.67]I don't feel like the... Oh, what the fuck?
[103:27.59]No, I grabbed that!
[103:29.07]Everything feels like I made the mistake, not the game.
[103:32.11]That's a huge deal.
[103:34.16]Like, that's a gigantic deal.
[103:47.63]Okay, radio.
[103:51.09]Alright, I'm going to go this way.
[104:00.90]Good.
[104:02.97]OK.
[104:04.13]Do it slowly.
[104:10.00]Good.
[104:12.14]Good.
[104:15.46]Looking good.
[104:18.09]OK.
[104:23.59]Yay.
[104:24.67]Ooh, delicious.
[104:32.74]This game needs romance options.
[104:37.69]Shut up.
[104:39.73]Caution.
[104:41.19]Fluctuating pressure detected in air exchange regulator valves.
[104:46.20]Stand clear of all intake vents during adjustments.
[104:57.78]Another rhubarb.
[105:01.77]I got a lot of these.
[105:02.83]I have so many spears.
[105:03.99]I'm going to have to use them eventually here, right?
[105:06.98]Do I just use them right now?
[105:08.50]I feel like I could skip all this.
[105:09.48]No.
[105:10.23]Should I?
[105:10.51]I have so much of these.
[105:13.35]Alright, I got...
[105:28.90]Okay, well, did that even help me or did I just get inventory panic?
[105:38.96]Let's go ahead and reassess this because this is a dead run if I keep doing this stupid shit here.
[106:03.73]I got inventory Ivan, okay?
[106:06.93]I freaked out.
[106:07.83]It's like, I have too many things, so I have to use them.
[106:10.12]So might as well use them.
[106:11.14]And then I, I screwed it all up.
[106:13.94]Like, I don't, I don't, I don't know.
[106:15.68]I, inventory Ivan.
[106:16.70]I'm sorry.
[106:17.40]This is what happened.
[106:23.65]That was going good too.
[106:24.93]Alright.
[106:25.89]I'm going to care way less about the items.
[106:29.22]I'm just going.
[106:30.04]Unless I absolutely, it's absolutely necessary.
[106:32.76]I'm not going to use them.
[106:55.37]I had it all planned all along.
[106:59.03]Oops.
[107:13.20]That way.
[107:25.40]You get a little more time than you think to do the grab.
[107:32.01]The stamina drains a little bit slower when it's red.
[107:34.29]It's not quite over yet, though.
[107:37.06]I gotta keep that in mind.
[107:39.86]I see bright red hands and I freak out.
[107:51.58]Uh...
[107:52.89]I'm going to say climb this, but that might be a long way.
[107:56.44]I got to be ready for the spinach.
[107:59.52]Okay, I need to be ready with the spinach.
[108:01.39]With my left hand.
[108:18.73]Okay, good.
[108:25.82]Holy shit.
[108:26.86]It's gonna close on me.
[108:28.58]I'm good.
[108:29.12]I'm ready to relax.
[108:34.63]Any more rhubarb?
[108:40.60]Any coins?
[108:41.16]No.
[108:45.85]You can do 99% of rooms without items.
[108:48.79]Says Master of the Gamester.
[108:52.09]It feels that way.
[108:54.67]I got a little too cute with that.
[109:02.62]That's pretty self-explanatory.
[109:29.30]Nice.
[109:33.77]I'll be ready with the I got the right left hand.
[109:47.99]Just keep it rolling, keep it rolling.
[109:58.30]Keep it rolling.
[110:02.32]Nice.
[110:03.61]I like that one.
[110:04.79]That was good.
[110:10.07]Good.
[110:12.07]Alright.
[110:12.53]Back on track.
[110:13.56]About 200 meters.

[110:27.31]Another rebarb.
[110:31.64]These things are bait.
[110:32.77]I don't know why I even want to use them.
[110:34.41]You know what?
[110:34.73]Just get them out of the way now.
[111:03.70]Come here.
[111:07.51]Get over here!
[111:18.14]I have spinach in my right hand, ready to go.
[111:23.37]Okay, we're gonna have to eat it maybe in a second here.

[111:56.92]How do
[111:58.66]Fuck, I'm already... That was fucking stupid.
[112:05.71]I should not have done that.
[112:12.26]Sorry, I got a replacement coming up.
[112:13.62]We're fine.
[112:20.18]This way for sure.
[112:27.65]Was it the joint or the bong today?
[112:31.34]I don't know.
[112:31.80]I don't smoke out of a bong.
[112:32.96]It's too much work.
[112:35.84]You gotta smoke out of a bong and then you have to, like, power wash it.
[112:39.27]I don't... No.
[112:39.99]Otherwise, like, no, dude, it's fine.
[112:41.49]The bong water fucking smells like fucking somebody's asshole, but it's fine, dude.
[112:45.05]Hit it.
[112:46.13]No, I'm not gonna... I don't want that in my body.
[112:50.16]I don't want your, like, badass breath water, like, accumulating down here.
[112:54.62]No.
[112:55.97]No, it's alright, dude.
[112:56.75]I just like, I put my mouth on this and my bad breath goes in there.
[113:00.53]Oh, great.
[113:00.97]No, no, thank you.
[113:05.68]Good.
[113:06.22]Alright.
[113:18.33]I got a lot of coins.
[113:19.55]Don't blow it.
[113:24.12]Okay.
[113:25.08]I feel like I'm getting close to the break.
[113:29.26]I don't know what to do with this one.
[113:39.97]Alright.
[113:40.52]Don't overthink it.
[113:42.12]But I'm overthinking it.
[113:45.12]Good.
[113:45.74]Okay.
[113:47.22]I'm going to need a rhubarb.
[113:49.53]I don't have one.
[113:52.59]We're going that way.
[113:55.66]No, we're gonna go that way actually.
[113:57.98]This is safer.
[114:13.88]Let's go!
[114:14.50]Oh shit, oh shit, I need to eat food.
[114:18.98]I need to eat.
[114:19.60]How do I do it again?
[114:25.90]That was a little further than I thought it was going to be.
[114:27.76]Let's go.
[114:28.38]I'm good.
[114:29.12]Best ascent ever.
[114:30.75]I made it.
[114:36.58]Break room.
[114:41.94]Cool.
[114:42.06]I got a lot of money too.
[114:56.42]Eat your spinach, yeah.
[115:06.72]Look at all this.
[115:10.20]Look at that eight coins in there.
[115:15.69]I don't think I need anything.
[115:17.19]Maybe it should.
[115:17.57]Maybe actually, you know what?
[115:18.39]Maybe I should get one.
[115:20.84]What is the brick even for?
[115:24.22]I could get that.
[115:25.98]Let's recombobulate this a little though.
[115:27.84]This is kind of ridiculous.
[115:33.17]I'm going to use this like a keychain.
[115:37.65]Better.
[115:39.87]I'm going to take a quick break.
[115:43.58]I'm going to drink some of this coffee.
[115:46.44]What was that?
[115:53.46]bug up there yeah I see it I gotta make sure I can get it though I think I'm just gonna hoard everything I don't really care about it I'm see if I wait is it gone um I feel like there's gonna be a point where I'm gonna say why didn't I buy that I'm spying one okay I think I'm ready to move
[116:24.29]You made it past 500.
[116:25.23]Uh, I got to like 380.
[116:29.04]But this is a good attempt coming up here, so.
[116:33.51]I'm ready to go.
[116:34.59]Let's move.
[116:37.89]I gotta be quick though.
[116:38.77]No just sitting around like an idiot.
[116:44.22]Move.
[116:44.58]Gotta go.
[116:45.13]Don't even think.
[116:45.57]That shit's coming up now.
[116:58.36]Alright, where are we going to go?
[116:59.26]Where do we want to go?
[116:59.84]That way for the rope?
[117:03.55]So much food too.
[117:04.39]Nice.
[117:04.79]Okay.
[117:06.09]Keep moving.
[117:06.85]Okay, I'm running out of base in my inventory.
[117:10.12]It's getting there.
[117:11.28]Now we're going to use the rhubarb.
[117:12.96]Perfect placement for this is who fucking cares.
[117:16.25]I don't care.
[117:17.53]I got to go that way.
[117:18.91]Wait, what an idiot.
[117:20.29]Go this way.
[117:20.91]No, go that way.
[117:38.42]Oh no, I got wiped out.
[117:39.40]I got wiped out.
[117:40.84]I got wipe out.
[117:41.79]The game wipe out.
[117:43.09]Whatever network it's on.
[117:44.05]That was almost really bad.
[117:44.99]Okay, give me... I got Q. That's bait.
[117:49.87]Don't grab it.
[118:03.17]Oh god, I'm freaking out.
[118:04.87]I'm so nervous.
[118:05.51]That's the first part.
[118:06.25]I've...
[118:12.71]Lighting in corridor B-12 remains at 64% functionality.
[118:20.36]Please report any outages.
[118:23.09]Good.
[118:23.81]Okay, furthest I've ever been.
[118:31.44]I've never been this far.
[118:34.20]Let's... I gotta go.
[118:37.17]I don't care about bugs.
[118:41.92]Okay, shh.
[118:49.67]I'm gonna puke.
[118:50.93]I'm gonna puke.
[118:51.43]Which way do I go?
[118:51.95]That way.
[118:53.33]I'm gonna puke.
[119:08.15]Okay.
[119:08.27]What's that do?
[119:09.79]I don't know.
[119:20.90]Just don't think.
[119:21.46]Just go.
[119:21.90]You just gotta go.
[119:22.73]I can't think about anything.
[119:25.35]Nice.
[119:27.85]Uh... Just eat it.
[119:43.83]Good job eating that.
[119:48.67]This stuff's sucking me out!
[119:51.38]What's going on?
[119:59.02]Uh... What do I do?
[120:05.12]What do I do?
[120:22.13]Fuck you, motherfuckers, watch this!
[120:25.35]Oh, I can't, I can't get it.
[120:33.56]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on a second.
[120:35.24]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[120:45.11]Okay, I need to, I need, whoa!
[120:53.02]What do I do?
[120:57.77]Get off me!
[120:58.70]Get off me!
[121:00.22]Okay, okay, go!
[121:02.02]I don't know what to do, guys!
[121:12.05]I don't know what's happening!
[121:16.62]I'm fucked.
[121:17.70]I'm fucked.
[121:18.22]I'm fucked.
[121:18.86]I'm fucked.
[121:20.28]Wait, hold on.
[121:21.64]Slow down.
[121:22.46]Slow it down.
[121:27.13]I need to eat this.
[121:29.19]And then I need to put this in my inventory.
[121:31.42]And then I have to go like this.
[121:32.22]And then I have to go like this.
[121:34.70]And then I have to go like this.
[121:35.84]And then I have to... That's fucked up.
[121:42.43]Alright, that part's fucked up.
[121:47.01]That far is fucked up.
[121:48.59]You gotta... Yeah, I'm getting noise gated.
[121:57.26]Yeah, I had to turn it on.
[121:59.44]I had to turn the noise gate thing on.
[122:00.89]I have a van blaring at me.
[122:04.09]It would be like... Alright, so if I get there again...
[122:16.22]If I get there again.
[122:18.52]Hmm.
[122:23.47]You gotta be ready to switch hands, hammer.
[122:27.90]Switch hands, hammer.
[122:30.38]Switch hands, hammer.
[122:36.81]I can't even believe I actually made it through the first part of that.
[122:39.43]I fell down.
[122:40.41]Me getting grabbed by the monster was actually something that was helpful.
[122:53.66]Some sounds you're making are just not there.
[122:59.15]The noise gate will just mute you at times.
[123:00.93]Yeah, because I make a loud noise, I go like... We can... Let me turn the noise gate off and see how bad it is.
[123:12.56]You're probably going to hear the game a little too sometimes.
[123:14.58]Let's find out.
[123:18.69]How is this?
[123:20.47]And I'll do a test.
[123:21.05]Ready?
[123:21.87]Can you hear the fan?
[123:29.32]Like, can you hear... Can you hear this?
[123:32.26]When I'm throwing shit around.
[123:35.97]Sounds about the same.
[123:43.81]Okay.
[123:43.93]Yeah, because I have it over my speakers right now.
[123:47.04]So, as long as you can't hear it over the speakers, then I think we should be fine.
[123:50.22]Let me do a scream test.
[123:53.80]Better?
[123:55.99]Alright, so that one... I gotta be ready for that.
[123:58.78]This game's fucking crazy.
[124:01.05]Alright, well, whatever.
[124:01.97]I'll turn the gate off.
[124:04.59]I was assuming you guys would be able to hear all the fan blaring and everything, but if we can't, then we're good.
[124:08.46]Let's go.
[124:11.80]I'm going to make this one quick.
[124:13.74]Because I want to get up there very quickly.
[124:25.54]That's what all the rhubarbs are for, by the way.
[124:29.58]Well, I'm glad I dropped them all.
[124:31.70]No items at all.
[124:47.70]Great.
[124:49.00]Nice work.
[124:49.96]It's incredibly important.
[124:51.24]It's one of the four pillars of the home spirit.
[124:56.13]Speaking of which, House Flipper Round 2 Invitational.
[125:01.69]I don't know if people were here when I first talked about it.
[125:04.35]Getting another date scheduled.
[125:08.74]Should be in the next week or so.
[125:11.32]Looking probably somewhere around that.
[125:14.16]Like Monday or Tuesday, the 23rd or the 24th.
[125:16.98]Seeing how people feel with that.
[125:18.13]Looks like people have been okay with that date so far.
[125:21.77]If that date does not work for a lot of people, then obviously we'll move it around.
[125:24.81]But that's kind of where we're thinking.
[125:27.24]And we probably won't need a round three.
[125:30.49]Well, not round three, but we won't need a part three, I don't think.
[125:34.03]So that should be it of the other rounds that are scheduled.
[125:38.92]But yeah, alright, gotta move.
[125:50.34]Ah, you blew it.
[126:06.22]Yeah.
[126:11.91]I almost just went back that way like an idiot.
[126:21.80]Okay, looking good.
[126:22.76]Keep going.
[126:32.95]Cool.
[126:35.18]When is the Drac pack gonna get Dracula 3?
[126:39.77]You know, I heard it was your birthday coming up.
[126:43.69]You specifically.
[126:45.74]And I think that there could be a birthday surprise for you.
[126:54.53]Like dude, my birthday is like December 5th.
[126:57.49]Okay, well see you in December.
[127:07.67]Dude, my birthday's tomorrow.
[127:09.71]Oh.
[127:19.16]Oh shit.
[127:21.93]Can I like stretch my hands out a bit to go faster?
[127:35.71]Oops-a-daisy.
[127:38.35]Only 150 meters, I feel like I've gone a thousand.
[127:59.53]I gotta rest the hand sometimes.
[128:06.05]Alright, inventory is looking like a fucking mess.
[128:10.16]Get that shit out of here.
[128:22.54]My problem, I'm so slow with the swapping around items.
[128:26.83]It's like an old lady.
[128:28.89]Oh, put the hammer in that hand, and then... Well, I think I need it in this one.
[128:34.59]I'm so slow.
[128:36.54]I don't think I'm going to get faster.
[128:41.42]Just take it from the inventory directly?
[128:42.79]I know, but I'm so slow.
[128:43.91]Like, I have to look.
[128:44.69]I go, oh, what's that?
[128:46.11]Oh, sweetheart, what's that?
[128:48.05]Oh, it's your birthday?
[128:49.62]Here's a card, and of course, there's going to be a check in there for $20.
[129:02.86]Stupid no, why did I do that?
[129:23.38]I was trying to just be good at the game and- Why did I do that?
[129:29.63]I was trying to just be good.
[129:31.95]Ugh, what an imbecile.
[129:34.49]Man, like, I can do like the jump, grab, jump, grab.
[129:37.58]No, you're not ready for that yet, you fucking asshole.
[129:41.16]I'm so pissed.
[129:44.83]Ugh.
[129:50.58]It's because I started talking about how I'm a grandma, and I was like, no, not watch this.
[129:54.71]So, like, the ten of you watching that were like, oh, man, he is a kind of a grandma, fucking granny.
[130:01.42]You'd see me go like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[130:05.79]And it'd be like, oh, shit, he still kind of plays games.
[130:23.33]Get to act three bro.
[130:28.16]You'll be lucky to get out of active one.
[130:32.28]Notice I'm going to get there though.
[130:34.96]Scheduled for tomorrow.
[130:38.51]Expect localized system interruptions.
[130:48.78]Ego Ethan.
[130:50.64]Let me go.
[130:52.80]Why do I have an ego?
[130:56.18]I mean, I was trying to have an ego, but I didn't have one.
[130:59.49]It was too late.
[131:03.28]I'm just glad I'm not in inventory Ivan this time.
[131:09.71]Everything has to have the same letter of the same thing of the banana.
[131:23.49]I lost that item.
[131:29.79]How are you this ass?
[131:31.13]I almost just beat Act 1 on my sixth try of the game.
[131:36.64]You should be thanking me.
[132:03.06]Let's go.
[132:10.05]Clean this up just a little.
[132:15.12]Still got the rope.
[132:16.62]We are good to go.
[132:29.58]Going straight up.
[132:34.94]Good.
[132:42.03]Cookie bug.
[132:44.10]Thank you.
[132:59.18]Let's go this way.
[132:59.78]It's faster.
[133:07.09]First of all, don't go up there with red hands.
[133:20.48]Mm-hmm.
[133:28.03]Good.
[133:29.41]Good.
[133:30.81]Okay.
[133:32.29]Alright, let's go over this way.
[133:34.74]And, um, I'm not sure is this a better way to go than this.
[133:38.04]I think this is better than the other way.
[133:44.41]That's a little better.
[133:45.15]Okay.
[133:46.93]Alright, let's go!
[133:47.92]Let's go!
[134:02.17]Is this a coward play?
[134:04.51]It would have been if I put another steak there.
[134:09.64]Alright, I need food in left hand in case this gets hairy.
[134:28.58]Get this shit out of the way.
[134:29.59]That's gotta be cleaned up in the break area.
[134:37.42]I think one more run and I get up to the break area, I think.
[134:42.49]Yeah, clean this shit up.
[134:44.11]Clean this up.
[134:44.63]Clean this shit up.
[134:50.80]How did I not pick that up?
[134:53.04]I have no idea.
[134:53.52]Can I reach?
[135:04.26]Yep.
[135:10.43]I don't, wait, maybe I should get another rope.
[135:12.83]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[135:15.65]No.
[135:23.38]I might get over encumbered.
[135:26.43]Whatever that phrase is.
[135:34.24]Wait a minute.
[135:35.28]Wait a minute.
[135:35.82]Wait a minute.
[135:36.26]Wait a minute.
[135:36.70]This is not going to work.
[135:49.86]That is.
[136:00.36]Go faster.
[136:01.36]I am.
[136:01.89]I got this.
[136:08.12]Break room.
[136:08.70]Alright, third time I've been to the break room.
[136:13.09]How we doing?
[136:16.29]Good.
[136:18.05]Uh, eight coins.
[136:19.03]I got law.
[136:20.59]Okay.
[136:20.89]This is where I got to lock in big time and change this shit.
[136:30.04]Also visit.
[136:30.71]I probably should take a break because it's coming up right on one hour.
[136:35.07]Good place to do it.
[136:36.43]I'm going to pee.
[136:37.49]I'll be back.
[136:37.93]I'm going to flush out all that bullshit and I'll be right back.
[136:44.45]No breaks.
[136:46.02]I have to.
[136:46.50]Otherwise, my brain will explode.
[136:49.74]It's already been two hours.
[136:50.91]I know.
[136:51.23]This game is really good.
[136:52.65]It's kind of melting time.
[136:53.49]It's really fun.
[136:58.86]Alright.
[137:00.63]I will be right back.
[137:01.89]A few minutes.
[137:02.47]See you guys soon.
[138:24.81]Emergency.
[138:30.81]Fire suppression systems offline in sector four.
[138:35.58]Manual intervention required.
[139:55.38]Alert.
[140:19.44]Elevated humidity levels detected in silo 92.
[140:24.21]Dry goods containment integrity may be compromised.
[140:28.66]Okay.
[140:30.62]Hello, welcome back.
[140:34.16]I think we're good to just kind of keep rolling, right?
[140:37.71]I don't have any money.
[140:38.33]I do want to get this situated because I'm not going to have an opportunity to.
[140:42.86]I have a lot of these things.
[140:45.42]A lot of them.
[140:47.39]I have a rope knowing what I know now if I get back up there.
[140:52.47]I could kill with rhubarb.
[140:57.14]Climb rope.
[141:00.91]OK, I think I have too many of these.
[141:06.65]Get them all concentrated in the same area.
[141:10.44]Get these up here.
[141:11.98]OK, I'm not.
[141:12.88]I don't hate this.
[141:18.84]Although... I really don't want that in my hand.
[141:24.21]Okay, this is starting to get a little much.
[141:28.54]This is getting to be a little much.
[141:29.56]I'm going to get rid of one of these.
[141:31.01]I don't think I need them all.
[141:38.12]I don't need them.
[141:39.26]Just get rid of it.
[141:41.83]but I do want to make sure that there is, this is available.
[141:44.23]So I remember I can click and that just goes in the hand.
[141:46.91]So if I go, if I hit E out and then click bank, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[141:52.02]Oh my God, I'm gonna fucking fail this so bad.
[141:54.16]It's not even funny.
[141:55.81]Alright, let's go.
[142:09.00]Alright, time to move.
[142:09.99]Don't waste any time.
[142:10.99]I need the time.
[142:16.55]Ah, okay.
[142:25.04]Air?
[142:26.75]Oh no!
[142:30.63]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[142:37.58]Oh... Beelzebub has a devil for a side for me!
[142:43.19]For me!
[143:01.46]Go, hurry!
[143:06.20]Oh shit, this is death if I don't get this right.
[143:15.76]Okay.
[143:17.06]Oh my god, that's what that does!
[143:25.11]What if I let go, is it bad?
[143:29.08]Um, guys, I don't know what to... I thought it was gonna keep blowing me up.
[143:40.70]I didn't think it was gonna only do it a little bit.
[143:44.20]I thought it was only... I thought it was gonna blow me up more.
[143:54.58]I thought there was going to be more force at the bottom of it.
[144:00.33]Ah!
[144:01.54]Shit!
[144:03.38]Damn it!
[144:04.18]I was fucking mad at that!
[144:07.17]I thought it was going to be like a... Whatever, we go again?
[144:11.42]We go again?
[144:13.18]If only you had items you could use.
[144:15.40]Yeah, but okay.
[144:16.74]When you see this big fan, I'm like, okay, what happened?
[144:19.51]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[144:22.57]I just learned it for the first time in 20 years, okay?
[144:28.26]Last time a game had that in their game, it was Super Mario.
[144:31.73]And you jumped off the cliff, but it's like, no, you didn't.
[144:35.27]You know, there's been a severe lack of the wind blows you up mechanic.
[144:39.52]I just crushed that bug.
[144:40.60]That was your fault.
[145:06.50]Okay, good.
[145:07.76]Everything's going just fine.
[145:08.84]We're just doing, we're doing fine.
[145:10.75]That way.
[145:12.95]Yep.
[145:17.41]This game's cool.
[145:19.50]This game's cool, man.
[145:29.69]I found the most addicting game of the year.
[145:32.19]Hey guys.
[145:36.88]You may not have heard of this game, but I found it, and it's the most addicting game of the year.
[145:40.38]What is it?
[145:40.86]Stay tuned to the end of the video.
[145:43.81]And it's a black screen for 58 seconds.
[145:48.17]And then finally, at the end of the video, I say, White Knuckle!
[146:00.84]I can do that, right?
[146:03.07]Oh, look at that little secret they're just throwing at me here.
[146:06.58]Look at that.
[146:07.06]I see what they're doing with this fucking bullshit.
[146:13.00]Ster just went, nice, dude!
[146:15.25]Yes!
[146:18.75]Right there, Ster was like, yes, man!
[146:20.63]He's fucking got it.
[146:24.82]Did he see that?
[146:25.36]Oh, he saw that?
[146:26.32]Yup, he did.
[146:26.94]Oh, he's doing so much better than he was before.
[146:28.88]Imagine the progress in two hours.
[146:50.57]Nice.
[146:51.93]Ster is taking a shit right now.
[146:53.27]Oh, okay.
[146:54.71]Why can't he watch while doing that?
[147:10.85]I fucking blew it.
[147:11.61]No, I didn't.
[147:12.41]Oh, man.
[147:13.19]Slow down.
[147:13.83]I hate it.
[147:14.13]It's like in Mario when you jump too many... Just... It's fine.
[147:17.64]Oh, God.
[147:18.00]This is a fucking disaster.
[147:18.84]This is a fucking disaster.
[147:30.53]Disaster.
[147:31.33]I fucking lost it.
[147:32.23]My ability to play the game.
[147:33.72]You know when you fight a boss in Elden Ring?
[147:36.52]And you do it so perfectly and then there's one time you go in there and you forget how to play the game.
[147:51.04]I don't have time for that.
[147:55.17]Fuck.
[147:55.91]Fuck.
[148:05.55]This one was kind of a hard one.
[148:21.07]Shit, I gotta use a barb.
[148:29.97]This area is kind of terrible.
[148:31.01]This area is hard.
[148:34.66]Clutched it.
[148:37.52]Clutched it.
[148:50.79]Yeah, this one's rough.
[148:52.05]This seed is rough.
[148:55.15]I'm surprised I got through that.
[148:57.56]How come you like climbing games so much?
[148:59.80]Because forward and upward momentum is fun to have progress on.
[149:07.87]Okay, let's put this away.
[149:28.75]Climbing is just fun.
[149:29.57]It is, yeah.
[149:34.08]You are right.
[149:38.95]Alright, almost at the break room.
[149:41.15]And then... You know.
[149:57.08]Think about it.
[149:57.70]I don't have a lot of items, though.
[149:58.76]I'm not confident on that.
[150:04.55]How are we doing here?
[150:07.55]This...
[150:08.55]Yeah, I kind of don't have a lot of items.
[150:12.03]This kind of is a shit run.
[150:17.52]Climbing and digging games.
[150:18.64]That's right.
[150:19.32]That's true.
[150:22.99]Who doesn't love climbing and digging, right?
[150:26.55]I feel like that's like our entire human ancestry is like digging and climbing.
[150:32.18]It's just built into our DNA.
[150:52.54]I'm not going that way, screw that.
[150:56.63]Do the radios actually mean anything?
[150:57.99]I almost just fell.
[151:27.46]Okay, break time.
[151:34.74]Alright, what are we working with?
[151:35.58]We're working with one of those fan rooms.
[151:37.25]Those ones aren't that bad.
[151:38.17]That's not terrible.
[151:39.65]I can work with that.
[151:45.13]Make sure I get everything in here.
[151:50.12]Decent amount of items.
[151:51.16]Don't even think about them, though.
[151:53.56]Why do that?
[151:58.34]I think I got everything I need.
[151:59.30]And you gotta keep the momentum going, so I gotta move.
[152:03.51]Those are Half-Life roaches?
[152:05.98]Alright, time to move.
[152:06.72]Let's go.
[152:07.11]Looking for 500.
[152:07.83]What'd I get to?
[152:09.37]515 last time?
[152:10.44]518 or something?
[152:24.61]What did the Founding Fathers say about climbing?
[152:33.87]Um, I don't know.
[152:34.23]Alright, don't distract me right now because I gotta focus here.
[152:51.48]I'm on this.
[152:53.36]I'm not on this.
[152:55.60]Alright, I am.
[152:57.85]Okay, watch the head.
[153:10.22]I just didn't jump.
[153:19.93]Should I get that can of corn?
[153:22.15]Whatever the hell it is.
[153:25.16]Alright, now where's the best way to go?
[153:27.40]Probably up there.
[153:34.83]That was almost a puke moment.
[153:41.69]Jump and grab, I think.
[153:42.59]I think that's the plan.
[153:50.40]Good.
[153:51.06]Okay.
[153:53.63]That way?
[153:58.43]Oh shit, that was almost bad.
[154:03.40]Alright, 350.
[154:04.50]Getting there.
[154:05.08]There it comes.
[154:05.68]Okay, here it is.
[154:06.36]Here it is.
[154:06.62]Here it is.
[154:07.50]Be ready for this.
[154:09.33]I got a rope.
[154:10.03]I got two rhubarbs.
[154:12.37]I'm ready.
[154:14.55]This is where shit got totally screwed up last time.
[154:17.98]Okay, here we go.
[154:19.60]Don't think.
[154:20.36]Just move.
[154:20.84]You got items.
[154:28.19]Stop.
[154:29.95]Stop.
[154:40.10]Okay.
[154:40.80]Now?
[154:42.64]That way?
[154:54.36]Good.
[154:55.40]Relax.
[154:56.38]Take a second.
[154:57.44]What's the surrounding look like?
[155:00.19]I don't know.
[155:00.95]That, right?
[155:01.47]I remember this.
[155:02.67]Time it.
[155:04.05]Beautiful.
[155:04.93]Perfect.
[155:07.74]Continue.
[155:08.26]This is the one.
[155:24.45]This is the run.
[155:24.97]Right here.
[155:35.65]Okay.
[155:36.38]Phew.
[155:36.82]Let's go.
[156:16.90]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[156:18.82]Here's the deal.
[156:19.90]Here's the deal.
[156:20.38]Watch this.
[156:20.70]Ready?
[156:21.52]Here's the deal.
[156:26.79]What does that even do for me?
[156:28.75]What does that even do for me?
[156:29.85]I don't- I don't know what to do!
[156:41.27]I don't know what to do!
[156:44.89]Wait!
[156:45.19]Yes, I do!
[156:51.91]No, I don't!
[156:52.63]Fuck!
[156:53.07]I don't get it!
[156:53.59]How do I do this correctly?
[156:55.56]You can't jump high enough.
[156:57.36]There was a hole?
[156:58.06]Wait, what?
[157:00.27]There was another hole?
[157:01.01]I couldn't go that high.
[157:10.69]Okay, when you get there, you have to, like... Okay.
[157:13.80]If I see that one again, you need to, like, plan an entire route?
[157:17.60]Or was there a way I could go in?
[157:19.09]There was a wall hole?
[157:21.09]Oh, fuck me.
[157:23.45]I saw that, too, and I was like, maybe that's a place I could go.
[157:26.04]But it didn't seem high enough.
[157:28.00]It seemed like that was, like, really low to the ground.
[157:30.72]I thought I had to do it in that room.
[157:32.43]Oh, whatever.
[157:33.41]Okay, let's go.
[157:42.30]I thought is when you get in there, you're in there.
[157:45.20]And then you got to go up with the fans and shit.
[157:50.57]Honestly, the hole was hiding behind a small box.
[157:55.08]I didn't know I had to go to another hole.
[157:56.78]I was like, okay, hey, you get in this hole.
[157:58.79]Now you got to deal with the fan shit.
[158:01.41]Good luck.
[158:02.67]Not look for other hole on side.
[158:06.42]Whatever, I'll get there in fucking 10 seconds.
[158:07.88]Watch this.
[158:30.09]Let's go.
[158:38.24]I ain't fucking around.
[158:47.53]I'm just climbing up just like a fucking weirdo.
[158:57.32]I don't care.
[158:57.68]I'm just climbing up like a fucking weirdo.
[159:08.94]Alright, look for items.
[159:11.98]Oh my god, he's so quirky.
[159:15.12]Do you think so?
[159:16.80]Stud up.
[159:18.87]Stud up.
[159:35.59]I went too fast.
[159:44.20]How do I take the knife out?
[159:46.17]Take out the fucking gun!
[159:47.45]I don't- It wasn't even equipped!
[159:48.69]What the fuck is going on?
[159:50.17]Why was that not in- I was pressing E and it's not even- Why is that not just default in E?
[160:07.30]I love this game, but fuck this game.
[160:32.59]Only listen to the first half of that statement.
[160:40.73]No, I actually love this game.
[160:41.83]This game is awesome.
[160:43.98]I'm very, very, I'm having, this is, this is like probably game of the year.
[160:47.00]I've played like eight games this whole year, but this is fucking great.
[160:49.48]Ster was right.
[160:51.06]This is wonderful.
[160:53.75]I am so addicted to at least beating the first act to cat, to get my cash out of my friend token with Ster.
[161:05.37]I'm gonna do it.
[161:05.93]I will do it.
[161:06.53]Guaranteed.
[161:16.93]I had the right idea.
[161:27.74]What is this thing for?
[161:28.64]Is it a piece of candy or something?
[161:34.29]Hmm.
[161:37.55]Great.
[161:40.60]Excellent.
[161:44.14]I ricocheted so many times.
[162:02.98]Any items?
[162:12.37]Is that high enough?
[162:22.92]I think it's high enough.
[162:24.88]Yes, it is.
[162:26.86]Yes.
[162:27.24]Yes, it is.
[162:30.75]Oh, God.
[162:31.29]Can I stand on that?
[162:36.09]I can.
[162:42.29]This is bad though.
[162:45.29]This actually is not good.
[162:52.44]OK.
[162:53.96]Yes, look at that.
[162:58.91]Look at that fucking skillful display.
[163:04.74]I'm still kind of screwed though.
[163:08.04]Up and around there.
[163:11.48]I guess.
[163:12.94]Hold on.
[163:13.12]Can I go up here?
[163:25.26]I'm going to have to kind of... Can I grab that?
[163:31.07]Yep.
[163:31.49]Okay.
[163:37.28]Holy shit.
[163:38.10]That was so dumb, but I'm fine.
[163:45.62]Hey, I think this guy is good.
[163:46.92]I have my moments.
[163:51.02]I deserve a sip of ice coffee.
[163:58.69]Hey, you should do a Displate collab.
[164:02.80]Who's that?
[164:04.30]Who's Displate?
[164:07.16]Streamer?
[164:08.91]Does he play White Knuckle?
[164:14.66]I know what it is.
[164:15.68]Jeez, guys.
[164:21.83]Attention.
[164:23.03]Routine maintenance has not been conducted in over three thousand days.
[164:29.37]System performance may be suboptimal.
[164:34.55]Suboptimal?
[164:35.31]Kind of like this run, dude.
[164:44.77]up you little dweeb what am I doing that was not correct uh I gotta move though I gotta move right now we need rebarb right I see where to go go go gotta move
[165:37.08]Am I screwed here?
[165:39.64]Nope.
[165:56.63]Did it!
[166:00.75]Hey, I got an ad for Displate that was the Chinese John Cena edit for some reason.
[166:06.78]What?
[166:08.81]What are you talking about?
[166:13.31]Why?
[166:20.84]It's real?
[166:21.93]Is it real?
[166:24.29]That's weird.
[166:25.77]What the fuck?
[166:28.95]I mean, I guess if you wanted that on your wall, I guess.
[166:37.33]I need items.
[166:38.19]I need that item in particular.
[166:41.70]Everyone just gasped.
[166:42.80]I didn't think he was going to make it.
[167:02.25]I have the confidence to make those crazy ass jumps now.
[167:05.36]I think we're cooking.
[167:08.71]Before, I would have gone the safe way.
[167:10.02]100%.
[167:10.52]Every time.
[167:28.18]good I'll take two ropes could I do like a donkey kong um freeze whatever it is tropical freeze and get two ropes and go go jump jump between the two of them I think that's the plan later on
[167:58.02]I don't think you're going to put those past me.
[168:00.40]Yep.
[168:02.96]That was a good haul.
[168:06.15]Except I... I gotta get rid of something.
[168:10.25]Let's get rid of this and we're going to use it to help us right there.
[168:14.20]What the fuck are you doing?
[168:16.50]It should have been 10-30% hot.
[168:18.97]You idiot!
[168:24.37]I got it.
[168:43.26]There's like this weird shit in the mod chat right now.
[168:46.06]It's like Leonardo DiCaprio, like a dog.
[168:50.03]Like Shiba Inu, the aliens guy from the History Channel.
[168:53.72]John Cena, Chinese edit.
[168:56.56]What's going on over here?
[168:57.47]Is this like what people can put on them?
[169:03.39]Dude, okay, that Shiba Inu one, I feel like is just, like, why would, like, why?
[169:07.90]I kind of want that because it's, like... That's, like, the most... I don't know.
[169:14.15]I feel like if you have, like, a picture of anything on your wall like that, it's just, like, oh, look, it's a Shiba Inu.
[169:20.58]Just, like, kind of looking at the camera.
[169:26.38]Like, oh man, you like Shiba Inus?
[169:28.18]Shiba Inus, is that like your dog?
[169:29.58]No, no, I mean, I guess they're okay.
[169:32.97]Alright.
[169:49.09]Is this a random dog picture?
[169:50.73]Why?
[169:53.90]Focus on the game.
[169:54.80]Focus on the game.
[169:55.86]Hold on.
[169:57.34]Break room and just like that back at the break room.
[170:00.99]Nice.
[170:02.49]Why are you so easily entertained?
[170:03.77]I don't know.
[170:11.02]Why am I so easily entertained?
[170:13.15]Why so serious?
[170:28.76]Anybody know what this does?
[170:29.68]This like crumpled up battery?
[170:42.26]Ster.
[170:44.38]Ster still here?
[170:48.71]What is this?
[170:49.63]It's a candy bar.
[171:00.03]Dev said you should eat it like right now.
[171:05.60]Should I eat this right now?
[171:09.85]I saw one person say yes, I'm not doing that yet.
[171:11.63]That person is a non sub.
[171:13.64]I'm not going to take a non subs advice right off the bat.
[171:16.96]Come on.
[171:20.97]Eat it.
[171:21.65]Dev said you should eat it.
[171:22.77]It's a better can of soup, OK?
[171:35.71]I don't know, a non-sub could be like trying to fuck with me and try to get me killed.
[171:40.93]They could have just joined the chat 15 seconds ago and like, oh dude, this dude's gonna eat this?
[171:44.20]What an idiot.
[171:44.64]Yeah, hey, eat that.
[171:46.80]Actually, do I trust subs even more than that?
[171:48.44]I don't think so.
[171:50.67]I feel like subs would be equally trying to get me killed.
[171:53.43]Alright, let's lock in.
[171:58.86]Here it is, the air exchange again.
[172:00.54]This bullshit.
[172:01.48]I've fucked this up three times now.
[172:04.21]Won't be happening again.
[172:21.52]Alright, here we go.
[172:22.96]Very important, very important.
[172:25.21]It's over the- Okay, it's covered with boxes!
[172:41.27]Oh, come on Gwen.
[172:53.77]Okay.
[172:54.33]Alright.
[172:54.63]I'm in.
[172:54.97]I'm in.
[172:55.29]I'm in.
[172:55.93]I'm in.
[172:57.03]Everybody relax.
[172:57.67]I'm in.
[172:59.42]Another one over there.
[173:00.54]I think I can do it in one jump.
[173:04.20]Oh!
[173:09.71]No!
[173:21.97]I was gonna go so much higher.
[173:24.19]They wouldn't have made it that easy, would they have?
[173:26.53]Oh my god.
[173:28.38]I'd rather have the monster level.
[173:31.06]For some reason, that one's just fucking up my head.
[173:33.00]I thought it was gonna be higher.
[173:38.43]Shit.
[173:42.18]Oh, that sucks.
[173:47.95]Okay, well, don't cut corners.
[173:52.22]I'm going to play like such a coward when I get back there.
[173:55.49]You have no idea.
[173:56.49]It's going to be a joke.
[174:03.06]You know what?
[174:03.90]I'm going to kill you just because I fucking feel like it.
[174:09.01]Grab me.
[174:14.12]Why won't he...
[174:16.95]Dude, that was such a buffoon move.
[174:18.71]I thought it was going to go higher.
[174:20.37]To be fair, that did kind of look like it was going to be perfect.
[174:31.00]Don't vote on this one.
[174:38.07]Emergency.
[174:39.63]Power grid overloaded.
[174:42.87]Not essential systems will be shut down.
[174:56.30]Dude, that's gotta be some.
[174:57.60]That was a good run.
[175:01.65]Say it with me.
[175:02.17]Good run.
[175:08.91]OK, I'm crossing up here.
[175:09.76]Stop crossing up like an idiot.
[175:24.03]I got money.
[175:26.32]Hey, you should talk like a wizard to help your gameplay.
[175:34.33]I think you need to... Let me live my life the way I feel like it, okay?
[175:43.98]And I don't feel like... I don't remember what you said.
[175:46.38]I actually don't remember the conversation that we're not having because there's no conversation.
[175:51.22]You said so.
[175:51.62]You made a statement and I responded to it.
[175:53.88]I don't even know what it was.
[175:55.51]I don't remember.
[175:59.92]God, I gotta clean my bong water so bad.
[176:02.38]Yuck.
[176:12.11]What's your problem?
[176:29.90]You're the one with the problem.
[176:34.53]All I got is solutions right here, okay?
[176:50.96]Why are you fighting random chatters?
[176:52.36]I'm not fighting anybody.
[176:53.78]It's all good here.
[176:57.55]Not fighting anybody.
[176:59.35]Who are you fighting?
[177:01.13]Chill.
[177:11.21]Three cookie bugs already.
[177:14.29]I can't believe you hit the bong on facecam.
[177:16.31]I don't even know if you can do that on Twitch.
[177:19.11]I don't think you can.
[177:20.11]Maybe you can?
[177:20.80]I don't know.
[177:22.30]That'd be weird if you could.
[177:25.30]Okay, is it something about... Okay, me drinking a bush light on stream.
[177:29.91]It's like, okay, that's drinking alcohol on stream.
[177:31.91]Obviously, let go if you're 21 and over.
[177:33.41]I feel like hitting a bong on stream is somehow different.
[177:39.58]Isn't it though?
[177:40.56]It kind of is.
[177:41.91]That's not like drinking a beer.
[177:45.37]I think that's a little more elaborate.
[177:48.07]But it's kind of... What's the big deal?
[177:54.58]Can you do that?
[177:57.92]I missed it.
[177:58.30]Whatever.
[178:05.83]It's a whole auditory experience.
[178:07.71]I know, that's true.
[178:11.98]But, okay, you see streamers take... Oh, I'm going to sip my beer.
[178:15.71]Oh, yeah, I'm going to have my... Yep, I have my brew with me here.
[178:19.73]Okay.
[178:20.43]But they don't really kind of turn over and just start... out of a bong.
[178:24.88]That doesn't really happen.
[178:35.81]Getting kind of heavy here.
[178:40.65]I'm not going to use it, but I just want to get rid of it.
[178:46.64]Be the change you want to see.
[178:48.06]OK.
[179:01.44]Alright, break time.
[179:02.62]Let's go.
[179:03.12]I got a lot of stuff to deposit.
[179:08.80]What is this?
[179:09.08]Is this a magic wand?
[179:09.80]What is that?
[179:10.54]Oh, no.
[179:10.80]It's a rope.
[179:17.50]I think I'm good on items.
[179:18.86]Maybe I kind of do want a rope, though.
[179:20.18]I feel like they're so useful.
[179:25.49]Hey, Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts?
[179:26.89]Both are at their current quality.
[179:29.30]Ugh.
[179:31.04]That sucks because Starbucks is terrible now.
[179:34.69]But so is Dunkin Donuts, unless you get it from like very specific.
[179:37.33]They both kind of dog shit.
[179:38.37]I don't know.
[179:39.69]Starbucks can be fine.
[179:48.89]It would probably, it's probably Starbucks still, honestly.
[179:55.96]Although, if you go, I will say, if you get it from their peak quality, peak quality, blueberry iced coffee, medium blueberry iced coffee with almond milk and two to three sugars, depending on how you feel, is the single best coffee order in the history of mankind.
[180:14.23]It's the best coffee order in history, period.
[180:15.89]100% best coffee you could ever have, period.
[180:20.16]There is no, no one can fight you on that.
[180:22.24]No one's going to fight me on that.
[180:23.54]It's the best coffee, period.
[180:26.53]Medium blueberry iced coffee with almond milk and three sugars.
[180:30.17]Two sugars.
[180:31.40]Depends on how sweet you like your coffee.
[180:32.70]Two sugars is great.
[180:33.88]It is the perfect fucking coffee.
[180:35.95]Especially iced coffee only.
[180:37.17]Don't get it hot and tell me it was gross.
[180:38.89]Don't get it hot and tell me it was gross.
[180:41.66]We're gonna say it twice so we make sure you remember that.
[180:46.05]Iced coffee.
[180:52.06]Blueberry, that's gross.
[180:53.12]You just... Oh, shut up.
[180:55.40]Please.
[180:56.90]You're gonna have it and you're gonna be like, oh my god, this is so good.
[180:59.81]He's a genius.
[181:05.23]It actually is amazing, though.
[181:08.18]I would drink a hundred blueberry iced coffees over anything that Starbucks had to order.
[181:13.75]Period.
[181:15.01]If it was at best quality.
[181:20.03]Sugar bomb?
[181:21.14]You just do two sugars.
[181:24.00]Two sugars is not a whole lot.
[181:25.28]I'd say that's reasonable.
[181:29.55]I think they do four usually in a medium.
[181:31.31]I usually go half sweet.
[181:35.62]I think the blueberry syrup itself is not that sweet.
[181:38.78]It kind of is, but where the fuck am I?
[181:44.53]Oh.
[181:44.61]It actually is really good.
[181:45.71]I was a doubter.
[181:46.35]I'm so glad that you've come around.
[181:49.18]Well, you... What does that mean?
[181:53.12]What's that?
[181:53.92]Secret.
[182:02.97]Yup.
[182:03.95]Huge.
[182:05.08]That's absolutely massive.
[182:10.12]I gotta get rid of some of this stuff.
[182:12.04]Uh, I'm gonna eat one of these.
[182:18.90]I have to burn into my memory that eat is it's not one on the keyboard.
[182:26.17]It's click.
[182:27.01]Everything is click.
[182:28.07]Alright, I gotta move.
[182:31.44]I gotta go.
[182:31.90]We gotta move now.
[182:40.64]Oh God, what does that mean?
[182:51.48]Alright.
[182:52.06]Okay.
[182:52.40]Okay.
[182:52.64]Okay.
[182:52.96]Okay.
[182:53.48]Come on.
[182:54.70]Come on.
[182:57.97]Come on.
[182:58.51]Hit me.
[183:12.50]Notice.
[183:13.90]Climate control systems for a deep substructure.
[183:16.76]Hooray!
[183:17.34]Remains within acceptable parameters.
[183:22.41]Alright, this shit, it was weird, but I'm alright.
[183:26.60]I gotta go around.
[183:39.81]Fuck it.
[183:40.93]You know what I mean?
[183:41.76]Fuck it.
[183:45.98]Fuck it.
[183:55.54]Yeah!
[183:57.24]Okay, keep moving.
[184:02.08]450.
[184:05.73]Don't blow it, just relax.
[184:18.88]Getting there.
[184:19.52]It wants me to go that way.
[184:20.92]Why are you doing that?
[184:21.92]That's bait.
[184:55.68]Yeah, let's go.
[184:56.65]Let's go.
[185:00.89]Alright.
[185:02.52]Yeah.
[185:24.20]I did it.
[185:28.27]I got to 500.
[185:29.33]I got to 500.
[185:30.97]I did it.
[185:32.67]I did it.
[185:32.97]I got 500.
[185:33.80]I did it.
[185:34.94]I got to keep going.
[185:38.44]This way.
[185:42.45]Okay.
[185:42.95]Okay.
[185:43.21]Come on.
[185:43.57]Come on.
[185:44.31]Come on.
[185:44.63]Come on.
[185:45.20]I got to go now.
[185:48.68]Please.
[185:56.28]Ugh.
[185:57.84]Okay, that- Ooh, there's an exit!
[186:09.10]I see an exit!
[186:14.58]Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho, yeah!
[186:23.87]Oh!
[186:28.27]Oh, no!
[186:29.54]Did I make it?
[186:30.82]What happened?
[186:31.76]It was right there.
[186:32.42]Did I make it?
[186:32.84]Did I win?
[186:33.94]Oh, my God.
[186:34.56]What happened?
[186:35.58]What happened?
[186:36.14]What just happened?
[186:37.37]I didn't make that jump.
[186:38.27]And it was so close.
[186:39.21]I didn't make it.
[186:40.53]I didn't make it.
[186:41.35]Oh, no.
[186:42.05]I thought I could make it.
[186:43.25]I thought I saw the... Okay.
[186:46.04]Here's what happened.
[186:46.94]Here's what happened.
[186:48.68]I got the achievement ding.
[186:51.16]I got the achievement ding.
[186:53.26]So I thought I was like, okay, I did it.
[186:54.93]So I can be a little slower.
[186:57.21]I got the achievement ding.
[186:59.56]And I slowed down.
[187:01.60]I froze up because I heard the achievement ding.
[187:07.73]I thought that was it.
[187:09.83]What was the achievement?
[187:11.65]What was the achievement?
[187:13.17]Why did I get an achievement there?
[187:15.05]It said exit, I landed, achievement unlocked.
[187:18.48]What achievement?
[187:19.16]I didn't do anything!
[187:21.30]Oh my god.
[187:23.60]It was replacing a hundred pittance.
[187:26.60]Oh my fucking god, dude.
[187:30.70]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[187:37.15]That's such horseshit.
[187:38.51]That's such horseshit.
[187:39.91]Leave that to the end of the fucking run.
[187:42.38]Can we accumulate our achievements and then get them?
[187:45.84]It was for putting a hundred stakes in the wall.
[187:49.93]Oh my god.
[187:50.71]I thought I seriously had it.
[187:52.13]I was like, oh, I did it.
[187:53.15]There's the achievement.
[187:54.12]Oh, that stinks.
[187:58.45]That stinks.
[187:59.63]I can't fucking believe it.
[188:01.71]But hey, when the going gets tough, you scream.
[188:10.37]Oh, man.
[188:15.85]I actually am sad right now.
[188:18.42]I truly thought the achievement on lock was because it's like, oh, you did it, act one.
[188:22.64]Nice, dude.
[188:23.36]Now keep going if you feel like it.
[188:30.13]Fuck.
[188:31.31]That was, I was doing so good at the very end, too.
[188:36.40]Man.
[188:48.56]That's so sad.
[188:49.98]How do you mute achievements?
[188:56.35]I don't want to hear it.
[189:01.06]Is there a mute achievement button?
[189:05.13]You can disable the steam overlay.
[189:06.79]I think the steam overlay is disabled.
[189:09.34]Oh, fuck.
[189:09.76]Hold on.
[189:10.20]Hold on.
[189:10.52]Let go.
[189:10.80]Let go.
[189:11.06]Where am I going from here?
[189:13.45]This is uh, this is fucking cooked.
[189:23.03]Wait, wait, wait, do I have any food?
[189:24.51]Dude, fucking mute the whole game.
[189:44.21]that one that one didn't count that one didn't count I can't believe I was right there I needed to grab one more ledge if I had not seconds count seconds matter here that that three to four seconds of just kind of like this is what screwed everything up I would have been so fine
[190:17.07]Why are there so many of these?
[190:18.93]Ah, this is a cooked seed.
[190:20.73]Fucking cooked seed.
[190:23.71]This actually is cooked.
[190:26.00]Cooked.
[190:29.32]It gets... You know what I can say?
[190:31.14]Cooked.
[190:44.18]How am I supposed to go here?
[190:45.42]This is bullshit.
[191:02.81]I bumped my head on him.
[191:04.14]I bumped my head on that guy.
[191:21.18]There's too many of these in round one.
[191:23.08]What the fuck?
[191:25.51]There was like seven of those things.
[191:27.21]That was fucking horseshit.
[191:31.82]We're not even at a hundred meters, you're gonna put five of those guys in there?
[191:35.31]Oh, that's a... that's a... cooked run.
[191:44.85]That one sucked anyways.
[192:00.97]Whoa, okay.
[192:39.83]I gotta be super ahead of that fucking thing at this point.
[192:47.24]Fuck this.
[192:47.84]Watch this.
[192:48.46]I'll show you a fucking run.
[192:50.28]More, more, more, MORE!
[193:24.43]Why are you trying so hard?
[193:25.51]It's the first level.
[193:26.45]Because I need to be on my total A game.
[193:59.29]Good.
[194:00.76]Whoa.
[194:06.59]I got so many of these now.
[194:14.13]Nice.
[194:28.52]What about Newton's third law?
[194:33.57]I don't know.
[194:37.51]You got a problem with the game?
[194:46.95]Back to 200 and it hasn't even been two minutes.
[194:49.99]I'm going nuts right now.
[195:00.79]I'm going absolutely nuts.
[195:02.67]Look at this.
[195:05.73]We're at the break room already.
[195:11.26]Jungle freeze.
[195:13.96]That was not jungle freeze.
[195:15.74]Thank god.
[195:16.93]Okay, I gotta make that- I gotta pull this out of my ass now.
[195:18.89]Notice.
[195:20.15]Long range communications offline.
[195:24.72]External contact is no longer possible.
[195:32.71]Saved it.
[195:57.04]Who break over there?
[195:59.69]Let's go.
[196:07.76]Brick.
[196:26.35]What's a brick do?
[196:28.78]Hey, what does a brick do?
[196:44.68]I don't even know if that fucking helped me.

[204:48.42]I gotta get my shit good.
[204:53.67]I have a lot of stuff.
[204:55.79]Okay, if I'm pink, does that mean that I move slower?

[205:45.50]This is guaranteed.
[205:47.65]I'll be back in a few minutes.
[205:50.55]Ads are going to start in about 30, 40 seconds.
[205:52.63]Maybe a minute.
[205:56.46]Pause or you're going to die.
[205:59.43]Oh, okay.
[206:02.83]I'll be right back.
[211:11.96]I took an entire mouthful of sunflower seeds.
[211:25.19]I definitely put way too many in my mouth, so I'm going to have to take a second here.
[211:37.10]There's just too many.
[211:38.55]You know when you do a handful of sunflower seeds and you think you know what you can handle?
[211:43.35]I was just like, that was way too many.
[211:45.23]They're deceivingly dense.
[211:51.28]I'm ready, let's go.
[211:56.12]Yeah, hey, you're deceivingly dense, right?
[211:59.69]Make it happen.
[212:02.19]Hey, me and the captain.
[212:04.45]Gonna make it happen.
[212:07.92]I don't know if I can do it.
[212:08.60]I don't know.
[212:09.04]I don't think so.
[212:10.02]It's this fucking air shit again.
[212:14.38]Oh, fuck.
[212:29.40]Oh, shit.
[212:30.06]Okay, hold on.
[212:30.48]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[212:31.30]I can kill.
[212:31.90]I have kill shots.
[212:37.85]Let's go.
[212:50.27]Damn it, please, no!
[212:56.98]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[213:15.44]Oh!
[213:47.23]Just like that piece of shit Battletoads level, I get it.
[214:02.52]Get off me!
[214:02.76]Get off me!
[214:06.77]Let's go!
[214:09.51]Sunflowers need to spit all over my microphone now.
[214:22.30]That's a fucking problem.
[214:43.22]What?
[214:44.18]What happened?
[214:44.98]I didn't... Don't... Dude, you fucking... The elevator... The elevator has a thing where if you are in the way, it doesn't close.
[214:54.57]It closed way too quickly.
[214:57.25]That... Why did it close so fast?
[215:00.46]I still am eating these fucking seeds.
[215:06.52]What happened?
[215:07.27]No, seriously, what the fuck?
[215:18.00]I'm so annoyed at this.
[215:20.14]Why?
[215:20.84]It closed right on my head.
[215:22.10]That's such dog shit.
[215:26.35]I got out.
[215:26.85]That was such a clutch way to get out of that.
[215:28.59]And then, oh, sorry, the elevator closed.
[215:32.98]That was fucking stupid.
[215:34.48]We can hear all your mouth noises.
[215:41.49]Yeah, because I turned off the noise gate.
[215:44.68]Oh, now I'm off.
[215:45.70]I'm out of my state here.
[215:48.09]That was so dumb.
[215:49.75]Of course, that's the, oh, fucking stupid way to die.
[215:52.20]He's doing so well, but watch out for that elevator.
[215:58.23]I didn't even know it could kill you.
[216:15.96]This is not going well.
[216:33.86]I can't believe the elevator just crushed me.
[216:37.23]That was the one too.
[216:38.19]I was right there.
[216:39.11]What are these couple of stupid fucking ways to die?
[216:49.53]I actually can't believe that last one.
[216:53.63]I was at 400, getting back to 500.
[216:55.76]I was so far ahead of the thing.
[216:57.54]A couple of close calls to just have my head get decapitated by an elevator.
[217:02.81]That doesn't feel good.
[217:05.47]That doesn't feel good.
[217:15.83]Is that not...
[217:19.46]I don't give a fuck.
[217:33.56]Let's go.
[217:44.42]Good thing I got that.
[217:46.20]Bros.
[217:57.01]Look at how slow that elevator was.
[217:58.55]Did you see how slow that was?
[217:59.97]That was... The one I had was times two speed.
[218:03.60]What was with the times two speed on that elevator?
[218:05.60]You see that?
[218:07.04]I don't know about that.
[218:08.25]I don't know about that.
[218:17.20]Yeah, I don't know about that, Banana Bros.
[218:18.58]This is... It's a little hairy for me.

[219:45.95]Don't go too far that you can't go up.
[219:56.28]This way.
[219:58.22]Come on, hand.
[219:59.63]Come on.
[220:00.59]Stretch it out.
[220:14.05]Little weirdo in the way.
[220:15.31]That guy's ruining everything.
[220:18.90]I have to be so conscious of that, seriously.
[220:35.68]That's gonna get me killed every other time.
[220:39.73]Look at how good I'm doing in the game.
[220:40.85]The fucking elevator thing is gonna get me killed every time.
[220:51.13]Good.
[221:03.10]Don't need it.
[221:14.43]I do need that, though.
[221:15.64]I like that you can grab.
[221:19.34]You can reach around and grab stuff that way.
[221:27.19]I appreciate that.

[221:41.75]Make that 31.
[221:50.59]I'll keep the food there for now.
[221:53.08]I'm not buying anything.
[221:54.08]Alright, it's time to clutch this up big time.
[221:57.34]I'm full screening this run.
[221:58.64]This one is it.
[221:59.48]You're doing good, honey.

[222:24.63]Time to do it for real.
[222:26.19]I'm actually going to do it for real.
[222:28.36]Locking in, not going to talk.
[222:37.20]Now I'm going to do it for real.
[222:49.50]Here he comes.
[222:51.17]Alright, go.
[223:22.65]Staying way ahead.
[223:25.91]Oops.

[226:27.67]I think I fucking- I think I fucked it.
[226:29.04]I think I fucked it.
[226:30.40]I think I fucked it.
[226:31.16]I think I fucked it.
[226:31.78]Guys, I fucked it.
[226:32.44]I fucked it.
[226:33.06]I fucked it.
[226:33.52]Guys, I fucked it.
[226:34.39]It's over.
[226:34.73]I fucked it.
[226:41.10]I fucked it.
[226:42.20]No!
[226:45.64]No!
[226:46.34]Oh, how did that keep fucking happening?
[226:54.83]That last, like, 25 meters is so fucking hard.
[227:06.15]Because I had to swap the hammer to the other hand and... It's fucking painful to do that when you know that there's a thing coming to kill you in 10 seconds.
[227:18.36]Okay.
[227:19.42]Well, whatever.
[227:27.67]That rope was bad.
[227:33.92]I thought I could.
[227:35.12]Yeah, fuck.
[227:39.27]That sucks.
[227:46.74]It's alright, I'll get there again.
[227:53.44]I just they weren't far enough apart and you have to like leap and fly up and grab.
[227:59.04]Ah fuck it sucks ass.
[228:02.03]Okay, let's go this way.
[228:26.50]I got, you know what I need?
[228:27.48]I need to keep at least two rebarbs for the very end.
[228:31.39]Because there's always a wall where you have to like place, then go, then place, then go, then place.
[228:34.94]No, fuck that.
[228:35.80]I'm throwing four rebarbs into the fucking wall.
[228:59.17]I'm zooming through the first 200 meters though.
[229:07.50]Like this is no... I can get through this no problem, no.
[229:12.19]Do you need the tools?
[229:13.03]I think you have to use the tools at the end.
[229:15.50]I feel like you kind of have to.
[229:16.82]It looked like there wasn't really any way to go.
[229:25.54]Unless is there one really specific way you can jump up there?
[229:28.33]I feel like there was just like a wall I had to go up.
[229:39.20]Attention.

[230:35.71]You're making me look bad!
[230:36.81]In front of all my fucking boys!
[231:04.67]What about us girlies?
[231:06.55]Yeah, you're making me look bad in front of my boys and my girlies.
[231:09.28]Oh shit, hold on.
[231:29.54]This game is so fun.
[231:30.96]I'm having a fun time fucking rebarb.
[231:40.59]How is this game is?
[231:41.49]How much of the is there?
[231:42.98]How much of the how much is this?
[231:45.26]How much of the game?
[231:46.38]How much game is left?
[231:51.40]New experimental machine unlocked.
[231:56.61]I got an experimental machine.
[232:04.47]How much more do they plan on putting in the game?
[232:14.10]This is early access.
[232:16.10]I feel like this is a full game already.
[232:18.45]They have a roadmap.
[232:19.93]Yeah, this feels like it's got plenty of content already.
[232:25.01]This is great.
[232:25.89]Seven acts planned.
[232:27.07]Holy shit.
[232:28.46]Damn.
[232:29.86]Okay, this is great.
[232:32.18]Alright.
[232:34.39]Hey boys.
[232:37.07]Girlies.
[232:38.70]Place your bets.
[232:39.64]I would say to bet on me.
[232:42.72]I ain't fucking around now.
[232:50.83]-2 again.
[232:52.01]You can't -2 more than twice in five minutes.
[232:54.68]It's cool though.
[232:57.50]There's a cooldown on it.
[232:58.26]You probably didn't know about it.
[233:00.58]There's a five minute cooldown for any twos at all.
[233:03.44]Except for plus twos because that's a positive enforcement.
[233:27.71]Keep going.
[233:28.49]I'm way ahead.
[233:39.22]Way ahead.
[233:52.96]Bingo.

[235:07.94]I can't do it.
[235:08.42]I can't do it.
[235:08.83]I can't do it.
[235:11.35]I can't do it.
[235:14.76]Okay, I'm good.
[235:15.24]I'm good.
[235:16.08]I did it.
[235:20.40]Grab one, you fucking idiot.
[235:22.19]Okay, slow down.

[238:28.89]I think I did it.
[238:31.74]Did I make it?
[238:32.68]I'm going.
[238:32.96]I don't know.
[238:33.34]I'm just going to keep going.
[238:36.78]I don't know what to do.
[238:49.01]Do I keep going?
[238:50.61]I did it.
[238:52.22]Oh yeah.
[238:56.12]Oh man, that was horrible.
[238:58.58]That was too hard.
[239:01.18]Oh man, that felt good though.
[239:03.57]Oh shit, I feel good.
[239:04.89]That was fun.
[239:06.89]That was fun.
[239:13.66]Alright, so what is a... Ster, what do I get for that?
[239:17.12]For Act 1?
[239:18.92]What was it?
[239:19.26]Tears?
[239:21.78]Use the computers in this room.
[239:23.07]Use the computers in this room.
[239:23.91]Don't press elevator.
[239:25.11]Okay.
[239:28.09]Use the computers.
[239:37.33]How do I do that?
[239:52.62]Different computer?
[239:56.58]Oh, other room.
[239:57.26]Okay.
[239:58.53]Oh, wow.
[239:59.19]That was crazy.
[240:00.47]I'm so happy I actually did it.
[240:07.23]Wait.
[240:09.81]There was a... Ah, yeah.
[240:12.86]I knew I was saving these up for something.
[240:16.12]Okay, so I have 26 bugs in the bank.
[240:18.39]I need four.
[240:19.33]Four does what?
[240:19.95]Save the game here?
[240:27.52]Yes.
[240:27.86]Okay, so I should go like this.
[240:32.00]I don't know what I just did.
[240:37.18]You missed a bug back there?
[240:38.93]There's a couple in here.
[240:42.59]Does it matter which one of these I put it in?
[240:45.02]They're the same bank.
[240:45.80]Okay.
[240:49.14]Did I miss a bug?
[240:55.44]Alright, so I'm going to activate this.
[240:58.72]Thank you for your purchase.
[241:02.43]Okay.
[241:05.23]What does that do?
[241:06.77]Buy the save and put it in the computer.
[241:18.47]Did I do it?
[241:23.89]New disk detected.
[241:24.71]Disk mounted on desktop.
[241:25.90]Okay.
[241:27.04]Perks and upgrades.
[241:29.66]Untitled disk.
[241:31.68]Okay.
[241:31.90]Perks and upgrades.
[241:35.27]Biological backup?
[241:37.87]Armored plating.
[241:38.93]Reduce grip loss from most hazards.
[241:41.08]Halves incoming damage.
[241:44.30]What does that cost?
[241:47.48]Eight?
[241:52.99]Tissue restorative.
[241:53.89]Increases stamina regeneration by 25%.
[241:55.47]That's amazing.
[241:57.44]Rabbit DNA.
[241:58.68]Long jump after jumping while crouching.
[242:05.85]These two are free?
[242:08.61]First two are free.
[242:09.37]So do I have to pick between them?
[242:12.26]I can't take all these.
[242:13.02]I have to pick one, right?
[242:20.41]I mean, I think it's this one or this one, but long jump.
[242:28.90]What is considered a hazard?
[242:36.10]Because I feel like I haven't been touching very many hazard walls.
[242:38.69]I don't think so.
[242:39.45]Monsters?
[242:40.23]Okay.
[242:42.45]How reliably am I going to use the bunny, though?
[242:44.85]Do you have to hit C and then jump?
[242:48.74]Ster said to pick one.
[242:53.24]Those ice sounds are really crisp.
[242:55.41]Hey, thanks.
[242:57.57]You jump a lot, though.
[242:59.39]I do.
[243:03.78]Restoration is good.
[243:06.63]I'm going to go with Ster's selection here because Ster has 23,000 points in this game.
[243:13.84]And I think he said to pick one.
[243:21.95]Honestly, he kills himself with bunny.
[243:23.77]That's what Ster said.
[243:26.28]That's probably fair.
[243:31.88]I'll go with one.
[243:34.81]To receive biological enhancement, pull the lever.
[243:36.69]Keep your left hand still.
[243:37.92]Do not flinch.
[243:44.27]I'm not moving.
[243:50.50]No, he said pick one of them, not the first one.
[244:07.09]Well, whatever.
[244:07.71]I can take more damage now.
[244:10.14]So is the game actually saved?
[244:12.36]Do I start here now?
[244:13.92]Do I have to do anything else?
[244:14.74]Because I have that disk.
[244:15.68]Am I just good to go now?
[244:23.09]Now you have to do the backup?
[244:25.03]Okay.
[244:26.99]Okay.
[244:29.09]Saves.
[244:29.50]No backup data found.
[244:30.54]Prepare new backup.
[244:35.61]Untitled disk.
[244:36.77]Reformat.
[244:38.78]This will erase all data.
[244:39.96]Is that bad?
[244:45.79]What are we thinking here?
[244:49.35]It's a blank disk.
[244:51.29]Check its contents first.
[244:52.63]You're good.
[244:53.56]Read the disk first.
[244:55.56]Untitled.
[244:58.24]Untitled disk.
[244:59.44]Okay.
[245:07.62]To back up neural process to PSPACE, look at screen, do not scream, do not obey what you see.
[245:19.33]Uh, I obeyed.
[245:19.97]I'm sorry.
[245:20.59]Congratulations, PSPACE backup complete.
[245:21.94]You feel any side effects, report to your local substructure authority for monitoring.
[245:25.60]You can save and exit while in this room.
[245:30.24]Okay.
[245:32.62]Am I good?
[245:35.85]Am I, am I, is it saved?
[245:46.00]just start trashing the place alright you get one free life now well that kind of wait I don't just I don't spawn here what do you mean I get one free life I don't spawn here forever now of course you don't you will respond here one time it's one you spawn here with the life after that you will full reset
[246:14.41]Just once?
[246:15.70]Oh, man!
[246:19.00]Okay.
[246:22.81]It's not that easy, sonny boy.
[246:32.50]Well, I don't even know what's in this game.
[246:33.91]There could be scary things in here.
[246:37.47]I don't know.
[246:39.76]I don't know.
[246:48.97]Well, not a time like the present.
[246:55.28]Oh, megalol.
[246:56.74]I almost died right there.
[247:01.09]New facility.
[247:13.10]The facility grows.
[247:14.48]Pipeworks.
[247:15.34]Drainage system.
[247:17.73]Good thing I took that damage decrease.
[247:28.47]Yeah, get away.
[247:30.06]You slimy bastards, get away.
[247:31.88]Get up, get off!
[247:32.80]Get outta here, get!
[248:02.14]I feel like I'm gonna bump my head on this.
[248:03.47]I feel like this dickhead right here needs to get whacked.
[248:11.20]Oh shit in my fucking pants.
[248:20.81]What's going on?
[248:21.47]What am I hitting my head on?
[248:22.43]What's going on?
[248:24.87]Oh my god, bro.
[248:26.20]What the fuck am I hitting my head on?
[248:56.40]Oh fuck.
[249:05.17]What are you thinking?
[249:06.01]I just got in trouble with mom.
[249:19.00]You think that's funny?
[249:19.84]What, you think that's funny to do?
[249:23.69]Oh, did all the kids laugh?
[249:24.89]Did all the kids laugh when you did that?
[249:35.46]I feel like that poison swamp is death.
[249:37.71]I'm afraid of it.
[249:48.25]I didn't sprint.
[249:49.55]That was annoying.
[250:05.53]Let go.
[250:06.22]I gotta let go.
[250:07.58]I gotta let go.
[250:10.07]I gotta let go.
[250:13.97]I gotta let go.
[250:40.79]Alien!
[250:41.19]There's an alien.
[250:58.13]Pipe organ?
[251:01.58]Alright, slow it down, slow it down.
[251:02.96]Don't be stupid here.
[251:04.87]I got time, I think.
[251:07.05]Alright, where we going?
[251:08.71]Up?
[251:08.89]I'm gonna jump and flop.
[251:10.97]In fact, block that.
[251:14.22]Oh my god!
[251:15.66]Worked out.
[251:20.46]Okay, keep going.
[251:27.61]What is this?
[251:31.76]Something shiny.
[251:33.25]That was a diamond bug and I missed it!
[251:35.55]Oh, come on!
[251:36.55]I ain't gonna lie, I'm kind of on a roll right now, though.
[252:19.69]Don't even need to do that.
[252:21.17]Put it away.
[252:26.17]PUT IT AWAY!
[252:30.88]Grab the steam.
[252:48.92]Take out the fucking- eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it.
[252:54.71]It's like I got hit in real life.
[252:56.83]Dude, you fucking dickhead.
[252:58.45]Come on, do it already!
[253:07.39]I fucking can't believe it!
[253:09.37]I was doing- oh my god!
[253:11.69]I was- everything was fine!
[253:14.84]But like, the steam was like, steam off-
[253:18.16]STEAM OFF.
[253:23.13]I thought it was gonna be STEAM OFF.
[253:27.47]It's STEAM OFF.
[253:29.28]STEAM OFF.
[253:31.92]Oh, you motherfucker.
[253:33.38]Alright, that actually pissed me off.
[253:34.92]Let's go.
[253:36.71]Wait, can I buy another disk?
[253:41.27]Wait, you guys didn't tell me I could buy a disk?
[253:44.40]Why didn't you tell me I could buy a second disk?
[253:48.35]What are you talking about?
[253:52.20]I could have bought a second- No, okay, they're lying.
[253:53.90]Okay.
[253:56.78]Alright, this is the one.
[254:00.81]Alright, the fucking steam.
[254:02.23]Dog shit.
[254:02.95]That's fucking dog shit.
[254:04.46]I'm so pissed at it.
[254:10.40]What was that?
[254:11.49]Oh, little- You squee- Steve off!
[254:27.11]What is this?
[254:28.57]That's like a staff?
[254:30.34]I have no idea.
[254:51.70]Good time.
[254:52.80]What does it do?
[254:53.20]Casting spells?
[255:06.37]Oh my God, I have nothing.
[255:12.59]Good thing I had this.
[255:14.33]Oh fuck.
[255:24.41]Am I screwed?
[255:28.01]Am I screwed?
[255:29.49]Oh, thank God.
[255:50.78]Get out of here.
[256:01.49]Careful.
[256:05.88]Where is it?
[256:06.16]Where am I grabbing?
[256:06.70]Rest the hand for a sec.
[256:14.37]Oh my god, I'm gonna piss it.
[256:18.75]I have to take a second.
[256:19.71]I have to.
[256:32.11]Hurry, come on.
[256:33.29]It's so much faster.
[256:46.08]Gotta go.
[256:48.21]Outside.
[256:48.55]I don't know what's screaming at me.
[256:49.75]Something said run.
[256:59.46]What?
[257:00.42]I don't have to go down?
[257:01.10]No, that would be crazy, right?
[257:08.95]Waste heap?
[257:09.85]That is a big scary thing.
[257:13.50]Can it hurt me?
[257:20.46]It probably has like a laser or something.
[257:24.93]Why are there enemies now?
[257:28.29]Oof.
[257:37.60]Shit shit Okay this way
[257:53.33]Come on.

[258:11.87]I need the juice.
[258:13.13]I need the juice.
[258:17.46]Where do I go from here?
[258:19.88]Wait, what's going on?
[258:21.06]Oh, fuck me in the face.
[258:24.24]Oh, I don't know.
[258:25.31]Okay.
[258:30.27]How am I supposed to get over there?
[258:32.77]Oh, these little nubs.
[258:34.82]It's the little nubs.
[258:39.08]Oh.
[258:43.14]There's a little nub sticking out of the ceiling.
[258:45.27]Shit.
[258:51.83]Oh man.
[258:54.74]I feel like it did pretty good for that being the first try.
[258:59.98]You gotta stop panicking?
[259:03.08]This is the second time I've seen that level.
[259:05.23]And I know I can only do it twice.
[259:06.99]Of course I'm gonna panic.
[259:10.93]You can bounce on the floating enemies?
[259:21.20]So what is this?
[259:23.89]New research.
[259:25.38]Perks unlocked.
[259:26.98]Do I get perks in the very beginning of the game?
[259:28.36]No.
[259:29.88]Food bars added.
[259:30.80]New silos.
[259:35.41]Bro, how does this even happen?
[259:37.27]How do you even get that high?
[259:47.79]Alright, I'm curious where this starts.
[259:51.35]Okay.
[259:52.39]I see.
[259:52.77]Okay.
[259:59.55]Ah, this game is amazing though.
[260:01.14]I love it.
[260:02.14]I think it's great.
[260:10.93]See if I can get up there quick.
[260:20.36]Hey, why did you abandon your 2025 catchphrase?
[260:23.36]It's just what I do.
[260:24.47]I haven't heard you say it for a while.
[260:26.35]Oh, well.
[260:28.07]Yeah, that's true.
[260:42.96]Pushing it to the limit.

[261:40.74]Come on.
[261:41.72]I can't be making those kind of mistakes.
[261:43.99]You know what I mean?
[261:44.57]I've already beat this.
[261:45.87]I'm already this far.
[261:46.75]Like, I can't make those kind of mistakes.
[262:08.26]Do you remember how happy I used to be to get to the break room?
[262:11.20]That's coming up in like 10 seconds.
[262:38.78]It's a daisy.
[262:48.12]Okay.
[262:50.92]High voltage?
[262:52.92]Can I make that?
[262:56.55]I don't think so.
[263:05.55]Dude, what are you doing?
[263:08.99]This is the easiest thing in the world for you to do right now.
[263:11.27]Look at how simple this is.

[263:13.74]What the fuck is happening?
[263:15.62]Why am- I'm just pissing myself off.

[266:10.45]Just in time to take a real break.
[266:13.45]I know I've been screaming a lot, but you know, guys, this is a stressful game.
[266:17.22]Ster told me that this was one of the most stressful games he's ever played.
[266:22.27]And I get it.
[266:23.57]It's great though.
[266:24.03]I love it.

[271:18.03]Okay, no more screaming.
[271:21.65]But, what's going on here?
[271:25.60]Not gonna scream anymore.
[271:26.60]We got that out of the way.
[271:28.12]I'm gonna relax.
[271:28.84]Take my time.
[271:32.53]No more yelling and screaming.
[271:35.49]No more hollering, as they say.
[271:37.67]No more hollering.
[271:41.86]Oh.
[271:44.46]Cool.
[271:46.88]Hang tight, you got this.
[271:50.61]What is that?
[271:51.07]70% climbing speed, 25% mass speed?
[272:06.13]Oh, the goop is the mass.
[272:10.32]So you move faster, but so does the sludge.
[272:15.99]Hmm.
[272:18.37]I feel like I'm gonna get killed doing that.
[272:23.52]What does this one do?
[272:25.94]Doesn't explain what it is.
[272:26.91]Does it just mean you can... I don't know.
[272:30.77]What is that?
[272:32.23]Something to do with the stakes?
[272:36.66]More stress is better content.
[272:38.94]Yeah, I agree.
[272:42.82]Faster climb.
[272:43.53]I want to test it out before I leave here.
[272:47.88]OK, that is that is fast.
[272:55.73]OK.
[272:57.52]I'm ready to move.
[272:59.96]No point, you're a jumping fool.
[273:04.09]I'm not a jumping fool.
[273:05.45]Let's go.
[273:10.51]This is very fast.
[273:33.97]Whatever.
[273:38.46]Watch out for that shit.
[273:46.27]Dude, that is so... I just got a haircut.
[273:54.31]The top part of my hair, like I have a Friar Tuck haircut now.
[274:13.70]So now I turn it back on.
[274:15.24]Good.
[274:27.41]Very nice.
[274:28.44]Keep it rolling.
[274:32.50]Dude, I'm loving this.
[274:33.38]I'm loving this, dude.
[274:34.04]Climbing speed.
[274:34.94]I'm loving this climbing speed.
[274:36.14]It's so good.
[274:38.01]You guys checking this out?
[274:38.73]You see how the climbing speed is fucking crazy, dude.
[274:51.28]I really didn't want to say anything, but like the climbing speed feels like it's like 75, it's like 150, 50%, 100%.
[274:55.72]That's a lot dude, that's freaking crazy.
[275:16.23]My nose is itchy.
[275:31.52]Don't!
[275:45.94]Don't.
[275:48.30]Don't get me.
[275:49.18]Don't touch me.
[275:52.13]Get away from me.
[275:53.37]Get away from me.
[275:54.33]Okay.
[275:57.11]Don't.
[275:58.82]Don't.
[276:00.38]Excuse me.
[276:04.14]Excuse me.
[276:06.07]Thank you.
[276:06.81]Excuse me.
[276:31.16]And look at that without even a single sweat on the brow.
[276:35.39]I made it to wait a minute.
[276:36.67]I didn't.
[276:46.18]What's that?
[276:50.11]What actually is that?
[276:52.05]There's something there.
[276:53.83]I don't care.
[277:05.05]Nice.
[277:06.09]Alright.
[277:07.63]Got some money.
[277:10.02]Good to go.
[277:15.32]Alright, that didn't take very long to get back here.
[277:17.20]I'm happy about that.
[277:21.19]Could you do this in real life?
[277:22.86]I could do this in real life for the first two things sticking out.
[277:29.43]And then I would hit my head hard on the back of something by slipping.
[277:34.86]And I would just be dead instantly.
[277:37.88]would go one flip grab one grab and then I would do the push fly up thing I couldn't grab anything else keep falling about at terminal velocity about five seconds and hit my head and on the corner something to be dead when does a human hit terminal velocity is it like five seconds six seconds ten seconds
[278:09.66]What the hell was that?
[278:10.86]That's was a scary one.
[278:12.40]12 seconds.
[278:24.37]Cool, let's go.
[278:26.81]Alright, well I got two perks now.
[278:30.26]I feel like that's gonna be great for this level.
[278:31.84]The climbing speed.
[278:40.32]Nothing on it.
[278:42.08]Let's save the game.
[278:57.07]Very nice.
[278:59.07]Alright, what do we got?
[279:02.63]Max stamina by 30%.
[279:04.30]That seems monstrous.
[279:07.40]I feel like that is monstrous.
[279:15.52]Take the first one.
[279:18.65]No, no, no.
[279:21.93]I want this one.
[279:24.03]I'm going to be flying.
[279:25.31]30% max stamina.
[279:29.18]I'm going to be flying around.
[279:37.89]Long jump after jumping?
[279:39.93]So you have to go crouch jump, then go byahoo.
[279:44.48]Ster said two I said I would have picked this one stamina alright I gotta actually I got I got some decent items okay so if I get that harpoon thing with the the big thing on the end is that actually um is that good like will that blow up like one of those big enemies
[280:17.72]Uh, did I save the game?
[280:20.33]I saved it, right?
[280:22.27]Yeah, I'm good.
[280:22.67]I'm good.
[280:24.33]Yeah, I'm good.
[280:26.50]Alright, let's go.
[280:30.14]This is going to be a solid attempt.
[280:31.26]This would be one of the probably one of the last solid attempts in this area.
[280:36.11]I'm feeling it.
[280:37.45]You ready?
[280:39.07]Everybody lock in.
[280:40.58]Give me your energy and you know.
[280:45.76]All that stuff.
[280:54.63]Yup.
[281:00.44]Warning.
[281:01.66]Severe elevator malfunction.
[281:03.76]No fucking around.
[281:04.82]Avoid elevators until further notice.
[281:08.67]Emergency evacuation route through drainage system.
[281:13.05]All personnel to report to lowest levels.
[281:15.85]Any resistance will be met with our security force.
[281:46.87]I lost a little time there, but it's alright.
[282:08.08]Good time save.
[282:09.02]Good time save!
[282:18.57]Somebody got me?
[282:27.50]Alert.
[282:28.68]Microtechs in segment B piping detected.
[282:32.67]Potential seepage of contaminated water to substructure 5 is expected.
[282:49.97]Fuck.
[282:51.36]Oh, come on, I didn't jump.
[282:52.58]Oh my goodness, that was bad.
[282:57.30]Um... Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[283:00.05]I gotta go for this.
[283:20.65]What the f- What's going on?
[283:30.72]What's happening?
[283:32.74]What's going on?
[283:33.84]What's going on?
[283:34.40]What's going on?
[283:35.01]Wait, what?
[283:36.19]Wait a minute.
[283:36.79]What?
[283:37.03]I didn't- I wasn't in- I wasn't up there?
[283:39.75]It was a- Wait, what the fuck is going on?
[283:43.90]It was a pipe on the other side.
[283:45.50]I- Dude, the game is go up, okay?
[283:48.74]The game is go up.
[283:54.77]game is go up.
[283:57.19]I didn't even look.
[283:57.94]No, I was just like, go up, go up.
[284:07.65]I'm fucking gonna freak out.
[284:12.24]I was so mad about that last one that I didn't even make the fucking jump.
[284:16.06]You gotta be fucking kidding me, dude.
[284:21.03]I can't fucking, I cannot believe what just happened.
[284:29.90]Fucking God.
[284:38.48]Dude, you can fail right there.
[284:41.16]I disagree.
[284:51.93]Can I not make that?
[284:55.34]That was going so good too.
[284:56.78]I just...
[285:00.26]Okay, what?
[285:01.71]I'm pausing it.
[285:03.27]Why have a pipe like that that's empty in the fucking ceiling?
[285:06.57]Like, Pat, cover that with fucking cement.
[285:09.74]That needs to be covered in cement.
[285:26.76]Those perks were great.
[285:34.63]I thought that there was usually multiple ways you can go.
[285:37.81]I thought I was doing myself a favor by like, oh, I'm going to go up this way.
[285:40.48]Look at that.
[285:40.82]There's a fucking pipe right there.
[285:42.30]It's fucking empty.
[285:43.56]But the empty pipe goes up three feet and then it's blocked off.
[285:47.18]Cover that shit in cement.
[285:49.73]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[285:50.25]What the fuck's going on?
[285:55.93]I gotta go that way.
[286:22.37]Anything- what is- items, right?
[286:36.99]The game needs cement.
[286:40.32]I would not have done that if it wasn't... Look, you straight up big circle in the ceiling.
[286:46.08]And it's dark up there.
[286:47.29]Like, oh shit, I gotta get up there.
[286:48.35]I've had to go through so many pipes in the ceiling.
[286:52.50]You know what we say here.
[286:53.64]Cover that... You know what I mean.
[287:10.30]Any money?
[287:13.70]No.
[287:13.78]Emergency.
[287:15.39]Elevator system malfunction.
[287:17.81]Do not use lifts.
[287:19.71]Seek alternate evacuation routes.
[287:35.83]Mm-hmm.
[287:40.51]Dude, the game needs more concrete.
[287:48.58]I thought I was being fucking cheeky.
[287:50.32]I thought I was going to get up in there and fucking... Oh, look at that.
[287:52.90]I'm going to continue.
[288:04.05]I pulled a rabbit out of my ass to get up in there.
[288:43.13]Look at how slow I'm climbing now.
[288:46.35]What the heck?
[288:54.71]My fingers just got fatigued.
[289:00.39]There's a game of fatigue setting in on my fingers.
[289:14.37]Mm-hmm.
[289:20.35]Let's go this way.
[289:21.97]Not particulates.
[289:22.79]Not particulates.
[289:25.44]Okay.
[289:40.73]That was cleaner than last time.
[289:50.12]Got the bug good.
[289:55.80]Get back for you.
[289:57.31]Put you away and.
[290:02.41]Good.
[290:16.25]I have so many of these.
[290:17.05]I don't have very many of these.
[290:19.08]Okay.
[290:19.58]Oh.
[290:20.40]No.
[290:20.70]Fuck it.
[290:23.47]What food would you kill for?
[290:24.78]I would not kill for any food.
[290:48.09]Okay, very good.
[290:49.69]Oh, this is gonna be ballsy!
[290:54.58]What food would you birth for?
[290:56.82]Uh, I wouldn't birth any food.
[291:02.64]Oh, that almost killed me.
[291:03.97]Dude, I keep getting those fucking twisted.
[291:08.09]See how twisted up I'm getting those?
[291:12.09]It's actually an issue.
[291:32.67]I feel like this is not the best way to go.
[291:38.64]But I'm doing it anyways.
[291:58.18]Okay, you can hit your head on the ceiling pretty bad here.
[292:01.11]Um...
[292:03.86]There we go.
[292:08.74]I fucking hate computers.
[292:27.15]I'm going such a weird way.
[292:28.67]This is so weird, right?
[292:33.19]What I'm doing is weird.
[292:34.91]This is weird what I'm doing.
[292:41.44]This is a little too weird.
[292:42.69]I think this is too weird.
[292:43.83]I fucked it up.
[292:44.83]Look at how weird this is.
[292:45.77]What happened to me?
[292:48.92]Like, dude, I kind of need to do that.
[292:53.05]Look at how weird I made this.
[293:02.55]That was weird.
[293:06.45]Alright.
[293:07.82]Let's go.
[293:08.34]What kind of GoPro are you using?
[293:10.38]Looks really good.
[293:11.68]Whatever the latest series is.
[293:22.21]I don't like that one, but I'm going to get it.
[293:24.33]200% stamina.
[293:36.65]Have we confirmed what this does?
[293:38.10]It just gives you a few tools.
[293:52.15]Minus 25% is a lot.
[293:53.96]It is, but I can climb for a lot longer.
[293:59.40]I'll do it.
[294:01.77]Let's see.
[294:02.29]I wanna see just how long that is.
[294:07.84]I think I'm invincible.
[294:12.63]Hold on, I'm just moving, making my fan stay in one spot.
[294:39.14]That's good.
[294:44.91]I don't think you got the perk.
[294:47.88]I didn't.
[294:51.90]Bug in the corner.
[294:53.64]I probably scared him off.
[294:59.93]Alright, let's lock in so I can make sure I get up there.
[295:06.02]I got there pretty consistently last time, but I do have... I don't see that big of a speed difference.
[295:11.66]I mean, it's, I guess, a little.
[295:17.27]It's locking.
[295:17.89]Here we go.
[295:36.70]I don't know what that is, but it seems kind of interesting.
[295:38.67]It's drugs of some kind.
[295:42.69]Okay.
[295:50.19]I haven't seen it yet.
[296:13.91]Keep going.
[296:16.52]Are you going to get in my way and make me angry?
[296:30.69]Caution.
[296:32.06]Air exchange super duct 5 biological obstructions detected.
[296:37.14]Facility air flow levels at 78%.
[296:40.25]Holy shit.
[296:48.07]That's so scary every time.
[296:53.07]Don't leave any items.
[296:54.06]I don't think I left anything, right?
[296:56.80]Shit, that was good.
[296:58.00]I caught that lip.
[296:59.08]Come on.
[296:59.94]I know there's a bug right there, but whatever.
[297:01.97]Oh, come on, man.
[297:02.63]I got it last time.
[297:03.35]You can do it.
[297:07.41]Oh, you're fucking killing me with this bullshit, man.
[297:09.57]Now you're just making me angry.
[297:17.09]You're killing me with what you're doing right now.
[297:19.45]You're making me so sad.
[297:25.56]Look, you're making me so sad here.
[297:27.10]I have to use it.
[297:28.99]No!
[297:31.03]Shit, guys!
[297:31.87]Shit, guys, this is bad!
[297:33.31]This is bad!
[297:33.99]This is bad!
[297:36.41]This is fucking bad!
[297:37.41]This is bad!
[297:38.43]This is bad!
[297:46.62]Dude, get over there!
[297:48.03]Oh my god, I fucked it.
[297:51.93]I just like, what even happened right there?
[297:55.95]What even happened?
[298:00.62]Like, everything was fucking fine.
[298:04.24]Was it the speed problem?
[298:07.17]Okay.
[298:08.31]I think it's because I had 25% less speed, I couldn't make those jumps anymore.
[298:15.06]This game is fucking hard.
[298:20.54]There was another jump that I could have done?
[298:21.92]I don't know.
[298:32.02]You need to relax?
[298:32.92]Dude, I was completely relaxed until I missed the jump six times and then lose the game.
[298:39.04]There is no... Just relax for three seconds.
[298:43.22]You can only relax for three seconds, and then when you blow it three times, it's like... Uh-uh.
[298:52.36]That was a bad start.
[299:08.13]I could have done it.
[299:09.33]I think the speed was fucking me up too because the last few times I was there, I just made those jumps.
[299:14.34]I think to that exact pillar.
[299:16.96]The speed, 25% less speed, I think just screwed me.
[299:21.76]Because I was like, why does this not work?
[299:24.31]It should work.
[299:25.03]It worked last time.
[299:27.05]It's because you would have 25% less speed, dude.
[299:30.73]I'm not taking that again.
[299:32.73]I want speed only.
[299:39.91]God damn it.
[299:55.81]I think Gamer Fatigue might have set in.
[300:00.40]Yeah, you don't make that jump in Act 1.
[300:02.38]I think it's Gamer Fatigue.
[300:03.80]Yeah, Gamer Fatigue has finally set in.
[300:08.04]It's been five hours of this.
[300:10.78]I'll give it another few shots.
[300:24.79]Did you see that like little dance move?
[300:37.28]It's called unk fatigue.
[300:44.09]What I'm saying is we fill that fucking sewer thing with cement.
[300:47.96]I beat that level.
[300:49.82]That's what I'm saying.
[300:53.01]You fill that fucking sewer hole on top of cement.
[300:55.85]It's a GG.
[301:17.38]I guess there's something to be said about just eating those, right?
[301:21.28]Favorite pizza topping?
[301:24.14]Um... I'm gonna have to say... It's probably just pepperoni, man.
[301:35.05]It's probably pepperoni.
[301:37.19]I know that's probably a boring answer for you, but... Sorry.
[301:41.32]It is what it is.
[301:43.42]Let's go that way.
[301:49.12]Is there a way I can get up there without having to get up that?
[301:54.60]Yes, there is.
[302:12.39]I need items.
[302:18.36]uh what's your thoughts on pizza yuck is it possible to not like pizza like maybe if you're lactose intolerant or something or allergic to sauce or something I'm so sorry
[302:46.61]I just thought of somebody at a restaurant not liking something to a point where they say they're allergic to that.
[302:53.30]You know what I mean?
[302:53.76]Like, oh, no, no, no.
[302:54.55]I am allergic to this.
[302:56.03]But they're not allergic to it.
[302:56.75]They just don't like it.
[302:59.15]Like, oh, I'm allergic to sauce.
[303:01.62]That's such a vague way to... That's a very vague thing.
[303:06.75]Like, what kind of sauce?
[303:08.05]What do you mean?
[303:24.02]We're getting there.
[303:28.19]I threw up because I was eating dumplings one time and I was convinced I was allergic to dumplings for years.
[303:34.15]I think you can still be kind of intolerant to something and not be necessarily allergic to it.
[303:44.16]Maybe not.
[303:48.57]I think I have to use a tool here.
[304:09.11]More tools.
[304:22.01]Thank you.
[304:24.42]Hmm.
[304:39.32]Alright, almost at the break room.
[304:42.78]This game is the most addicting game I think I've ever played in my immediate last few years of my life.
[304:52.36]Everything is so smooth and fluid and everything is fun to do.
[304:56.79]This game is great.
[304:58.07]I love this.
[305:00.34]I can't get enough of it.
[305:11.26]At some don't please don't.
[305:20.45]OK.
[305:20.53]Break room, what do we get for?
[305:23.64]Something good, please.
[305:30.04]The right climber in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world last for 10 minutes.
[305:38.23]What is that?
[305:48.08]G man, yeah, but what does it do?
[305:53.85]It gives you items.
[305:59.74]I kind of want this though.
[306:01.97]Sounds like it's useful.
[306:02.99]I feel like 10 minutes down here is.
[306:06.46]I would want that in the next area.
[306:09.38]Better map RNG.
[306:14.27]Is there a is there a Ster here?
[306:17.38]That could give us some pointers.
[306:27.99]I feel like I got really far with this one.
[306:29.31]I feel like this one actually worked in my favor until I had a crash out.
[306:34.64]This is a minor crash out, wasn't a big one.
[306:37.06]And then I ended up killing myself after that, so.
[306:42.25]Spawns boxes with items in it.
[306:44.30]Everywhere.
[306:46.98]I'm gonna take this one.
[306:50.05]I'm going for speed.
[306:57.43]Alright, let me make sure I'm good to go.
[307:11.77]Think I'm good.
[307:12.71]I got two rebars.
[307:15.57]I got plenty of food.
[307:17.05]Reminder elevator access to sub level 7 remains operational.
[307:24.36]Proceed with caution.
[307:26.20]Just say meltdown.
[307:27.74]You don't have to help be hip with the kids.
[307:30.05]Are you talking about when I say cooked?
[307:31.41]I was saying that a lot early, wasn't I?
[307:32.79]I did.
[307:36.69]I was.
[307:36.91]I haven't said cooked in awhile.
[307:38.01]You're right.
[307:39.83]Alright, let's move.
[307:48.07]I'm moving so quick, though.
[307:49.59]It's crazy.
[307:57.00]That perk is insane.
[307:58.60]Alright, um... Up around.
[308:01.09]Don't even pick it up.
[308:07.34]Not worth it.
[308:15.37]Okay.
[308:18.32]Alright, I guess I could go this way.
[308:21.16]That was really dumb, but it's okay.
[308:24.01]It's not over.
[308:24.69]I didn't fuck it up.
[308:25.40]I don't know why I thought I could reach that.
[308:28.39]I was so far away.
[308:45.69]Okay, we're fine.
[309:07.05]Fuck it, doesn't matter, just go.
[309:22.67]Oh, come on, bro.
[309:24.67]Don't write this to me right now.
[309:39.87]Oh, my God.
[309:41.24]What the fuck, dude?
[309:42.58]I gotta fucking make something happen right now.
[309:58.69]go come on so
[311:08.32]Oh my god.
[311:08.93]Easy.
[311:52.69]Why do I feel like this is going on forever?
[312:27.53]Yes!
[312:29.14]Alright.
[312:29.42]We're back, we're back, we're back.
[312:43.46]Oh!
[313:03.14]We did it.
[313:04.04]Hooray back to it.
[313:07.52]You kind of did the noise.
[313:09.91]Yeah, it was close.
[313:22.18]Alright, third time here, so I don't.
[313:24.72]Let's hope I don't crash out.
[313:27.93]Stop saying that OK.
[313:33.13]Close it up.
[313:38.95]Did I almost just die?
[313:44.28]Pressure seal engaged.
[313:47.14]Door latches all holding.
[313:49.74]No leaks detected.
[313:52.78]Hey, can we have ads yet?
[313:54.47]I'm going to hit you with the... I'm going to hit you with the... Hit you with the ads here.
[314:04.48]After I do all this and then we'll see how far I get.
[314:06.90]It might be the last break of the day.
[314:09.77]Gamer fatigue is setting in.
[314:13.89]So let's give this a solid maybe like that until I get through this and see how it goes.
[314:19.00]But let's pick these first.
[314:32.50]So can you have other disks?
[314:44.07]Increases stamina regen.
[314:46.03]That's alright.
[314:47.33]Increases the time buffs from items stick around.
[314:49.52]That's kind of good.
[314:51.46]When reviving by disk, all items are carried with you.
[314:55.47]Warning.
[314:55.77]Use of extracted Delta material is still under experimental testing.
[314:59.11]That's expensive.
[315:04.98]Item buffs?
[315:05.86]I feel like maybe just this one.
[315:14.36]Maybe the region, yeah.
[315:26.65]Alright, I'm saved right here.
[315:27.69]I'm good.
[315:28.15]I can't believe I fucked this up and walked right into that.
[315:32.32]That must have been so painfully funny to watch that happen.
[315:37.26]But I'm not going to do that again.
[315:39.37]I'll be right back.
[315:40.45]This will probably be the last break of the evening.
[315:42.68]I will see you guys in a few minutes, and we'll just go until I lose.
[315:46.70]See you soon.
[319:10.98]How's it going?
[319:13.22]I'm not pressing this button yet.
[319:14.32]I'm awaiting a sneeze.
[319:17.35]And if a sneeze props up in the middle of a run here coming up, that would be a disaster.
[319:24.42]So let's just chill for a sec.
[319:30.64]I know it's not happening.
[319:35.89]No, I think we're good.
[319:37.93]I think we're good.
[319:39.92]Alright, no messing around.
[319:41.00]I got good perks.
[319:42.00]I got good stuff.
[319:43.35]I'm ready.
[319:44.63]Don't rush it.
[319:45.53]Just get in there.
[319:54.40]Almost fucked.
[319:58.33]See what I mean?
[320:08.48]That one wasn't blocked off.
[320:10.41]Come on.
[320:13.98]He's going to be on that to the rest of the night, isn't he?
[320:27.58]Keep it up.
[320:37.73]Forget about the items.
[320:39.26]Although, you're gonna have to smash this with a hammer.
[320:40.66]Good.
[320:44.69]No!
[320:45.21]That was almost another diamond bug!
[320:50.87]Just relax.
[320:51.33]Who cares?
[320:52.33]Fuck it.
[320:52.71]We're going for wins.
[321:07.86]Is this the right way?
[321:08.48]Is this the right way?
[321:10.82]I almost did it again, guys.
[321:22.62]I'm not kidding.
[321:26.35]You saw me making my way over there.
[321:29.07]You saw me make my way over to the top.
[321:30.79]You saw what was going on.
[321:31.61]That's gotta get fucking cemented over.
[321:33.98]Cement's gotta cover that shit.
[321:45.10]What a waste of time that just was.
[321:46.94]Just go.
[321:47.24]Come on, come on, come on.
[321:47.97]Don't.
[321:48.39]Dude, you need the time.
[321:49.25]Come on.
[322:00.78]Get your ass out of here!
[322:13.43]All personnel are to report to the lowest levels.
[322:17.70]Any resistance will be met without security force.
[322:24.42]Fuck it, just go.
[322:27.05]Diamond bug!
[322:51.94]That's a PB right there.
[323:41.60]Okay, almost there.
[323:52.09]PB!
[323:52.51]Let's go!
[323:53.09]Come on!
[324:11.44]PB.
[324:11.90]Thousand.
[324:12.26]Let's go.
[324:12.60]950.
[324:13.60]Come on.
[324:26.66]I don't know if I should have done that.
[324:28.48]Okay.
[324:28.60]Hold on.
[324:30.42]Okay.
[324:30.72]Let me... Assess.
[324:31.52]Assess.
[324:31.86]Assess.
[324:32.54]Assess.
[324:32.90]Assess.
[324:33.92]Assess.
[324:35.33]Uh, I gotta assess.
[324:37.31]I've assessed.
[324:41.26]Assessment was wrong.
[324:43.08]Uh, assessment was wrong.
[324:44.34]Uh, it's okay.
[324:44.92]Assessment was totally wrong.
[324:46.72]I have no idea where the fuck I was supposed to go there.
[324:53.41]It didn't look like there was anywhere for me to go.
[325:00.74]Climb the big guy?
[325:02.82]It doesn't hurt you?
[325:03.64]What?
[325:04.68]Are you serious?
[325:06.39]I can- I thought it was gonna hurt me.
[325:09.93]Oh, come on.
[325:10.99]Really?
[325:12.69]Climb the big guy.
[325:13.47]What the fuck?
[325:14.71]I... You know, honestly, if you never told me that, I probably never would have done that.
[325:20.12]I never would have gotten past this part.
[325:21.31]That was a good PB, but I'll take the PB.
[325:42.34]Just about a thousand.
[325:49.86]Slow it down here.
[325:52.75]Terrible placement here.
[325:53.70]This is bad.
[326:07.00]I need items though, man.
[326:08.08]I gotta pick some stuff up, honestly.
[326:11.12]I'm going here completely with nothing.
[326:30.89]That was lucky.
[326:34.54]Shit, this has got to be good.
[326:36.44]This has got to be good placement.
[326:39.89]I think that's fine.
[326:42.63]Yeah, we're good.
[326:44.63]Keep rolling.
[326:52.02]Dude, I love this speed increase.
[326:53.69]It's so good.
[326:59.63]Not great.
[327:00.15]Not good.
[327:01.42]Not good.
[327:02.00]Come on, man.
[327:02.68]I got stuck.
[327:03.54]I was stuck in the wall.
[327:05.72]It's a bad time waste.
[327:19.91]Can I make up a little time right here?
[327:30.28]Oh man, oh man, come on, get it together.
[327:56.58]Dude, what the fuck?
[327:58.50]Fuck.
[327:59.17]Fuck.
[328:00.13]Fuck.
[328:01.01]Fuck.
[328:01.87]Fuck!
[328:02.45]Fuck, guys, fuck!
[328:04.29]Wait, what the fuck?
[328:10.70]No, no, man, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[328:13.27]No, no, no, no, no, come on.
[328:15.09]It's not over yet.
[328:15.97]It's not over, come on.
[328:24.88]Come on, get in there.
[328:25.88]We're good.
[328:26.24]Alright, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[328:28.22]Get it together.
[328:40.17]Okay, this is different.
[328:42.14]Give me some stamina.
[328:43.06]Go.
[328:46.97]Excuse me?
[328:47.35]What just happened to me?
[328:48.18]Why is my skin all burnt?
[328:50.62]It's steam.
[328:51.69]Okay.
[329:09.52]That's not good.
[329:25.92]That sucks.
[329:26.88]Oh, that's such bullshit.
[329:28.24]Oh, man.
[329:28.78]Oh, man.
[329:29.36]Oh, that sucks.
[329:30.00]Such balls.
[329:30.60]Come on, man.
[329:31.35]Really?
[329:31.61]And it pushes you, too?
[329:37.85]Oh, come on.
[329:40.43]I got right up there.
[329:41.41]I didn't even know there was one right there.
[329:43.04]I honestly couldn't even see where they were coming from.
[329:57.82]Damn it.
[329:59.58]I thought that was so close too.
[330:01.64]That was a good seed to get over there, but...
[330:07.99]I don't know.
[330:08.49]I don't like the steam.
[330:09.37]I think the steam is annoying.
[330:11.76]I'd rather have the fucking bugs and mutant people than the steam.
[330:19.15]Alright, this will be the last true try.
[330:30.42]Um...
[330:43.46]And I said, why are you going so fast?
[330:45.73]There is a blob that is filling up the ground.
[330:51.75]And if you don't go fast enough, it just kills you.
[330:54.34]So there is a thing chasing me right now.
[331:00.99]So you want to go as fast as you can.
[331:05.79]I was hitting a lot of lips, too.
[331:07.19]That was another thing that was annoying.
[331:09.11]That sewer level's got a fucking bunch of lips.
[331:12.18]Especially in, like, a tight little corridor like what I was in with the steam.
[331:17.02]I think that was a dog shit seed, I'm not gonna lie.
[331:21.05]I think it was a dog shit seed.
[331:22.53]I said it.
[331:33.39]Oh, he said it.
[331:34.19]How brave of him.
[331:48.43]Yeah, I admit it.
[331:49.61]I admit it.
[331:51.70]Warning.
[331:53.18]Unstable energy signatures detected in the experimental sector.
[331:59.08]Avoid all unauthorized exploration.
[332:19.73]Scoop around here.
[332:22.60]And let's make this jump and not make a fool out of ourselves.
[332:27.87]I thought I made a fool out of myself.
[332:29.11]It's okay.
[332:38.34]Do you wish this was on iPad?
[332:40.08]I don't think this works on iPad for me.
[332:41.87]I feel like it's too much controls needed for touch controls.
[332:45.63]I think it would be horrible.
[332:49.92]VR might be interesting.
[332:52.67]But iPad?
[332:53.57]I don't think so.
[333:06.92]Am I doing items good?
[333:21.19]I definitely have this first level down, I think, pretty good.
[333:23.84]The last hundred meters, though, is a little shaky for me still, but I think I'm steadily improving every round here.
[333:39.50]I'm trying to launch up there.
[333:56.39]Here we go.
[334:03.50]Well, it's not even going to get a benefit anyways.
[334:05.63]I keep pressing 1 to eat instead of to click.
[334:25.42]Woohoo!
[334:38.26]Alright, move quick.
[334:44.48]Uh, items or you got this?
[334:46.47]Which item thing is better?
[334:49.38]Should I do You Got This instead of G-Man?
[335:09.64]You Got This gives autopilot.
[335:11.96]I'll try it.
[335:17.66]What does it do?
[335:19.35]OK, hold on a minute here.
[335:22.41]Wait a second, I got some shit here.
[335:24.46]I have way too much stuff.
[335:27.30]This is a new item I've never seen before.
[335:31.57]I got three cans of of whose?
[335:36.39]Drugs or whatever they are.
[335:50.06]Auto secure hidden.
[335:53.75]Yeah, what does this do?
[335:58.55]What does this do?
[336:01.48]Because I'm going to put this into the ground and I'm going to scream.
[336:05.62]You don't have to hammer it in.
[336:07.28]Oh, that's huge.
[336:12.75]That's kind of.
[336:14.61]That's kind of a massive deal.
[336:16.89]And then what do these do?
[336:20.59]What did the alcohol or whatever actually do?
[336:26.84]You're invincible.
[336:27.66]Infinite stamina.
[336:31.29]Infinite stamina.
[336:33.44]Okay, these are actually kind of amazing.
[336:37.04]Alright, don't blow this because this is kind of a great potential run.
[336:43.15]Let's go.
[336:46.38]I'm going to put this up here because top right is the incredibly useful things.
[336:54.12]Food's over here.
[336:54.94]This stuff's over here.
[336:55.73]These are fine.
[336:57.53]Okay.
[336:57.65]I got a lot of good shit.
[336:59.71]It's not infinite, but it's close to it.
[337:03.23]Okay.
[337:03.35]Alright.
[337:03.57]Let me stretch my ass.
[337:06.12]And let's go.
[337:07.82]I'm confident in this one's going to be pretty good.
[337:27.23]Good ladder.
[337:27.79]That's good spawn right there.
[337:29.27]Good seed.
[337:34.70]Good seed.
[337:43.93]Oh, look at this.
[337:44.77]Look at this beautiful seed here.
[337:46.19]Gorgeous seed.
[337:53.24]Notice.
[337:54.82]Decommissioned training modules in chamber 12.
[337:57.69]Oh, it's a gorgeous seed.
[337:58.95]That's the best thing that could have happened earlier.
[338:05.66]Look at that.
[338:06.36]Oh, look at this gorgeous.
[338:07.73]Beautiful.
[338:08.35]It's a beautiful seed.
[338:18.05]Let's wait a second.
[338:34.16]Okay.
[338:41.82]Let's go ahead and just go up this way.
[338:49.49]Perfect.
[338:51.41]We're fine.
[338:52.11]Scoop that up.
[338:53.83]I'm going to have to hit this.
[338:54.61]I have to hit this.
[339:00.52]Careful.
[339:01.98]Careful.
[339:02.50]Careful.
[339:05.80]Okay, right there.
[339:08.84]That is not a surface I can get on.
[339:12.83]Calm down.
[339:15.22]Oh, bro.
[339:16.46]Bro, bro.
[339:17.32]Come on.
[339:18.52]Dude, come on.
[339:18.92]What the fuck are you doing here?
[339:35.04]I'm stuck in the... I was just stuck.
[339:39.01]Fuck.
[339:39.75]Oh man, I'm blowing it so bad.
[339:43.39]I'm blowing it so bad.
[339:44.29]It's like not even funny.
[339:56.73]It wasn't even funny and I gotta move now.
[339:59.33]I gotta move like right now.
[340:15.98]Okay, come on.
[340:34.46]I'm good.
[340:34.86]Everything's fine.
[340:50.12]Ah, this way.
[340:57.21]Um, okay.
[341:00.23]Good.
[341:00.35]Let's go.
[341:09.73]Bros!
[341:19.65]I don't know.
[341:25.54]I'm just gonna take it.
[341:26.10]I don't know what it does.
[341:30.86]Holy shit.
[341:41.86]Oh my god.
[341:43.44]It's too much for me to handle.
[341:44.54]Hold on.
[341:49.55]I'm not fucking around.
[341:53.12]It's a coward play but I don't care.
[341:54.48]This is the exit right here.
[342:11.00]You're like the comic relief funny goofy guy in the horror movies.
[342:22.68]hey remember this place yeah I do alright this is gonna be it whatever happens here this will be the end of the stream if I make it great I'll keep going if not then gg too bad but this game's I think this game's amazing this is wonderful
[342:51.42]Damn, Ster coming in with like the Omega game.
[343:00.17]This is great.
[343:10.68]And I guess they're probably going to keep adding stuff to it.
[343:12.62]I haven't even seen... Be careful in the substructure, hun.
[343:18.65]Hey, that was five minutes ago.
[343:21.00]I'm in the sewers now.
[343:25.06]Big deal.
[343:29.05]Oh, that's an even bigger deal.
[343:30.41]I feel like it's this one, right?
[343:36.76]That's crazy.
[343:38.36]That is crazy.
[343:39.64]I hope I don't blow it.
[343:47.27]That's five cookie bugs as well.
[343:52.79]Yeah, I think that's gonna be that every time.
[343:55.35]30% jump height?
[344:01.50]Got my backup.
[344:04.25]Okay.
[344:05.47]This is a mess.
[344:08.59]Let's get this in a better spot.
[344:10.14]I gotta drink these, too.
[344:11.60]Look at all these items I have.
[344:12.82]Don't blow it.
[344:13.64]Okay, I gotta be ready for these items.
[344:17.51]Okay.
[344:17.79]Okay.
[344:21.66]Holy shit, it's giving me a god seed.
[344:25.73]I gotta do well here.
[344:27.11]Don't blow it.
[344:28.05]I got a god seed.
[344:36.22]Okay, come on.
[344:39.28]I gotta do it.
[344:40.12]If I don't do it, it's fine.
[344:41.61]If I do it, that's great.
[344:43.79]Let's go.
[344:44.71]Here we go.
[344:45.29]Deep breath.
[344:49.57]Dude, this 30% jump height is crazy.
[344:59.12]Stop freaking out.
[345:30.36]It's fine.
[345:31.36]Okay.
[345:31.48]Do I have food?
[345:32.34]Eat it.
[345:35.75]Dude, you can just jump and grab that shit.
[345:38.01]Yo.
[345:39.95]Are we feeling a victory?
[345:47.62]Okay, stop.
[345:50.69]Stop laughing.
[345:51.79]Stop laughing.
[345:52.89]Stop laughing.
[345:53.99]I need... This is the...
[346:00.15]We need to fucking chill, okay?
[346:06.77]Get that shit out of here.
[346:35.03]Pick it up, what are you doing?
[346:37.19]Oh, just go, you fucking wanker.
[346:41.98]Go!
[346:42.40]What are you... The jump is a little high.
[346:46.30]The jump's high.
[346:59.12]Holy shit, bros.
[347:01.71]Oh my God.
[347:03.75]You need to fucking relax.
[347:07.15]I'm almost at a PV.
[347:17.20]Bingo.
[347:17.44]Get your bearings, get your bearings, get your bearings, get your bearings.
[347:41.29]That's one of the harder jumps of the Intagon Fire Run.
[347:45.32]What am I trying to say?
[347:46.56]That was the hardest jump in the entire run!
[347:49.46]Oh no!
[347:58.55]Oh no!
[347:59.28]I thought I had it!
[348:01.70]That's where I gotta go, right?
[348:02.66]Come on.
[348:09.75]Bingo.
[348:17.91]Okay, settle, settle, settle, settle.
[348:27.19]Where am I supposed to go?
[348:29.19]Where am I going?
[348:29.65]That way?
[348:30.33]That way?
[348:30.80]That way?
[348:34.70]I don't know what this is.
[348:35.24]Just drink it.
[348:35.60]I don't care.
[348:37.89]Um...
[348:55.70]You little shit!
[348:59.20]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[349:00.95]Um, um, um, um, uh... Alert.
[349:14.19]System flush protocol is delayed due to resource constraints.
[349:19.22]Expect possible water stagnation.
[349:26.04]Does that help me?
[349:30.36]Not really.
[349:44.22]Let's go.
[349:44.78]Come on, 900 meters.
[349:46.19]I'm only 500 pounds.
[349:47.93]Come on, give me more.
[349:56.09]What an idiot.
[349:57.49]That was a bad move.
[350:27.78]Come on, get up here.
[350:31.09]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[350:34.74]Oh my god.
[350:35.39]Okay, okay, okay.
[350:36.43]Now we go up and around.
[350:38.45]Quick, hurry!
[351:02.61]Pee pee.
[351:03.05]Pee pee.
[351:03.47]Pee pee.
[351:03.94]Pee pee.
[351:04.38]Drink the other one.
[351:08.78]Watch out for the steam.
[351:19.98]Pee pee.
[351:21.18]Let's go!
[351:25.94]Yes!
[351:38.56]Steam!
[351:39.82]Where's it going?
[351:40.86]Fuck it.
[351:41.98]Just eat the damage, I don't care.
[352:00.30]Excuse me!
[352:00.78]Excuse me!
[352:04.33]Guys, you can't- I'm good.
[352:08.09]Relax, everything's fine.
[352:21.15]Grab it!
[352:22.39]Please, you piece of fucking dog shit!
[352:36.98]Oh my god, my fucking penis!
[352:42.15]I'm serious.
[352:43.27]I'm serious.
[352:44.67]I'm serious.
[352:46.58]I'm serious.
[353:06.51]Yes!
[353:07.19]Come on!
[353:07.73]Am I up?
[353:08.41]Did I beat it?
[353:18.33]It's okay.
[353:24.25]Rest for a sec.
[353:25.53]Rest for a sec.
[353:27.08]Assess.
[353:28.20]Assess.
[353:28.78]Assessment.
[353:29.86]Assessment has been made.
[353:31.44]Assessment's done.
[353:40.23]Assessment?
[353:40.99]Assess?
[353:42.45]Assessment has been made.
[353:50.17]Assess?
[353:52.01]Assessment made.
[353:53.71]White assess.
[353:55.42]You see what I did there?
[353:56.84]I hit you with the double assess.
[354:14.47]It's okay.
[354:15.67]It's okay.
[354:16.15]That place sucks.
[354:19.29]I just got caught too many times.
[354:22.46]Oh, that sucks.
[354:26.38]That wasn't even the steam that was a problem.
[354:27.78]It was just trying to... It's alright.
[354:31.33]It's alright.
[354:31.95]That's a good PB.
[354:35.32]That was rough.
[354:36.70]But... Oh, man.
[354:37.82]Oh, man.
[354:39.14]I thought that was going to be the one...
[354:45.46]You know, it's like sometimes it's hard to see, I will say.
[354:50.51]Because some of those rebar sticking out of the eye took me a while, but I couldn't even physically even see them.
[355:04.13]Dark room like that.
[355:05.07]It's kind of there was some stuff sticking out of the wall.
[355:07.03]I could have probably grabbed.
[355:07.87]It's hard to tell.
[355:15.25]Can I turn that gamma up?
[355:38.45]Give me a sec.
[355:41.97]Oh my god, I have no items.
[355:43.26]This is fucking terrible.
[355:45.84]This is kind of disastrous, guys.
[355:49.19]I'm not gonna lie.
[356:00.70]This has got... This has got disaster written all over it.
[356:07.11]No items?
[356:08.55]This might be fried.
[356:09.51]This might be cooked.
[356:10.65]This might be... This is cooked!
[356:11.99]Look!
[356:13.43]This is cooked!
[356:14.41]No, it's not.
[356:25.75]Somebody grab me?
[356:26.37]What's going on here?
[356:37.07]This is cooked.
[356:38.75]Oh gosh, this is cooked.
[356:41.23]Please.
[356:47.24]I gotta get good RNG here at this next part.
[356:49.37]Otherwise, this is... This is... What the hell?
[357:00.14]What the fuck?
[357:05.79]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[357:11.08]Something weird just happened.
[357:13.05]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[357:14.65]Wait a minute.
[357:15.93]Something got a little weird there.
[357:18.50]That was very weird.
[357:19.86]I don't know what just happened.
[357:20.76]I couldn't move.
[357:33.67]Oh, I got no items.
[357:37.02]I just got to do pure climbing skill only.
[357:40.79]Oh, that's going to happen.
[357:47.40]Thankfully, I do have the jump perk still, which is huge.
[357:50.62]Alright, I'm going to be quiet.
[357:51.93]Let's make it happen.
[358:05.59]Fucking head on the ceiling!
[358:14.72]War is jumping the entire run right there.
[358:16.88]Smooth.
[358:27.33]I lost my grip.
[358:29.26]Freeze.
[358:30.16]Eat.
[358:31.54]Go.
[358:38.95]Freeze.
[358:39.59]Okay, assess.
[358:52.08]Up.
[358:52.16]I have no items, but I gotta... Aye, aye, aye, aye.
[359:04.51]Freeze.
[359:06.18]Yo, that's fucking kind of... Okay, one more.
[359:09.64]Okay, gotta go.
[359:13.69]Why did I not grab that one?
[359:15.76]Whoa, whoa, dude, what the fuck is going on?
[359:18.06]Why can't I grab it?
[359:20.25]Actually fucking weird.
[359:21.39]What's this weird shit?
[359:48.98]Alright, that was a dog shit seed.
[360:01.48]That's one of the worst ones to get.
[360:02.57]I'm good.
[360:06.01]I got no items.
[360:06.95]I got burnt ass hands.
[360:18.51]Lucky, unlucky, lucky.
[360:26.88]Dude, this bunny rabbit shit is starting to piss me the fuck off.
[360:29.85]I ain't gonna lie.
[360:46.39]Freeze.
[360:47.73]I'm gonna go this right pipe.
[360:51.22]Up this way.
[360:58.45]Freeze right here.
[360:59.57]I have no items.
[361:19.34]Keep moving, keep moving!
[361:20.32]Come on.
[361:21.25]This is a good one.
[361:31.06]Dude, come on man.
[361:32.46]Not right now.
[361:33.20]This is not the time for you to fuck up.
[361:37.05]It's the perspective changes.
[361:38.21]Fuck with my brain.
[361:42.27]Relax for a second.
[361:44.12]Up, up.
[361:46.28]Good.
[361:48.54]Not today.
[361:58.89]Not today!
[362:02.48]Who cares about the fuckin' diamond?!
[362:04.96]You idiot!
[362:08.04]The fuckin' Lord of the Rings meme!
[362:10.01]It's like, oh, maybe if I put it on for one second, if I wear it...
[362:21.02]Stop.
[362:22.18]We got barbs.
[362:24.81]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[362:25.75]No time.
[362:35.10]I hope this works.
[362:43.13]Oh my god, what did I grab?
[362:44.56]Who knows?
[362:46.88]Who knows?
[362:53.37]Ster, my hand hurts!
[362:56.40]Ster!
[363:02.20]I did it!
[363:08.93]Let's go!
[363:09.61]Look at this shit!
[363:14.20]Oh yeah!
[363:15.70]Oh wow!
[363:16.82]That was fucking crazy!
[363:19.49]I made it!
[363:20.17]I did Act 2.
[363:20.99]What does Act 2 get me?
[363:26.65]Oh!
[363:27.57]Press the button!
[363:28.41]Press the button!
[363:30.87]I don't care!
[363:31.37]Whatever, just press the button!
[363:38.36]Do I have to... Do I have to do anything else?
[363:42.37]Do I have to do anything else?
[363:43.47]This shit's going faster than the elevator.
[363:46.39]Please enjoy your...
[363:49.13]This is going faster than the elevator.
[363:50.25]Star, what do I do?
[363:51.17]Star?
[363:52.25]Star, this doesn't look like I made it.
[363:56.12]Oh, fuck.
[364:00.04]Oh, fuck.
[364:03.53]I gotta keep going.
[364:04.31]I have to keep going.
[364:04.97]I thought it was over.
[364:05.69]No, it's not.
[364:06.31]Relax.
[364:06.87]We're good.
[364:07.37]Just take this shit.
[364:08.07]We might need it.
[364:10.34]Put that in the fucking slot.
[364:12.72]And okay.
[364:14.20]Um, it ain't over yet.
[364:16.38]Okay.
[364:19.20]Um, what's that do?
[364:24.22]What's that?
[364:31.99]Oh my god.
[364:36.46]I'm just making sure you're still fucking watching.
[364:41.14]Where the fuck do I go?
[364:42.06]No, where the fuck, where do I go for real?
[364:45.95]Where do I go?
[364:46.65]Where do I actually go?
[364:48.63]Help.
[364:50.72]There's a third button.
[364:52.84]I did one, two, button, but how do I get over there?
[364:56.17]Oh boy.
[364:57.25]Gotta move.
[365:06.66]Button three.
[365:07.06]Got it.
[365:08.70]This shit's rising.
[365:10.26]Shit's rising, guys.
[365:12.18]What do I do?
[365:13.58]Shit's rising.
[365:14.62]Shit's rising.
[365:16.29]This shit is rising.
[365:18.73]Oh, fuck.
[365:19.21]Hold on.
[365:19.99]I need to do it like this.
[365:25.28]Oh, fuck!
[365:27.18]Oh, fuck!
[365:27.54]I don't know if this... What do I do?
[365:34.11]Oh, shit!
[365:35.47]Back to the elevator, now!
[365:36.90]Quick!
[365:37.54]Oh, fuck!
[365:38.34]Okay, okay.
[365:39.24]Um, uh, uh, um... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[365:44.07]Oh, fuck.
[365:44.63]Okay.
[365:45.37]Oh, my God.
[365:50.27]I have to go all the way right back into the elevator.
[365:55.10]You need to calm down.
[365:56.34]Dude, I thought I beat it.
[365:57.76]Oh, I might just lose right here.
[365:59.08]I think I'm gonna lose right here.
[366:03.25]Do I have food?
[366:10.76]Say a fucking Hail Mary for me!
[366:24.33]You didn't pray hard enough!
[366:27.83]God damn it!
[366:30.32]No!
[366:33.88]Oh, come on!
[366:35.01]I really- I did it.
[366:36.93]I did it!
[366:37.51]I just did- I didn't realize I didn't have time to sit there.
[366:42.64]No!
[366:47.83]I can't believe it.
[366:49.53]I gotta press the three buttons and then go all the way back.
[366:52.24]I didn't know you had to do that shit.
[367:02.63]I thought I just had to ride the elevator.
[367:04.29]That was such a great run.
[367:11.52]I did it.
[367:12.06]I beat Act 2.
[367:12.78]I don't give a fuck about that stupid...
[367:15.10]Oh, press the button.
[367:16.38]Oh, by the way, you have to go back to the elevator after you press the button.
[367:18.67]Oh, you didn't win yet.
[367:20.25]I won.
[367:20.63]I beat Act 2.
[367:21.07]I don't give a fuck.
[367:23.00]Act 2 is done.
[367:26.76]That was horrible, though.
[367:28.05]That was so difficult and so painful.
[367:31.75]That sucked such ass.
[367:33.50]That was awful.
[367:38.22]And I think I get, oh, I gotta get in there and press the button for the elevator.
[367:42.85]Oh, okay, just like the last time, I get through Act 1.
[367:45.08]Oh, just press the thing to close the vat of goo.
[367:49.28]No, no, no, this ain't done yet.
[367:53.29]Fuck!
[367:54.81]I'm so sad.
[367:56.84]I just, I didn't know, and now I do.
[368:11.13]OK, I need items.
[368:17.37]That's mean.
[368:19.56]I think that's mean.
[368:25.74]Is there a way to get up here like this?
[368:38.70]I'm going to have to do this right.
[368:39.42]You've done enough.
[368:40.26]I want to do one more run.
[368:43.14]Last round.
[368:45.90]It's a boss fight, basically, as a challenge?
[368:51.23]What the hell?
[368:53.79]That fucking dog shit.
[368:56.02]I fucking did it.
[368:57.50]I beat it.
[368:58.98]We all were there.
[368:59.66]We were all cheering.
[369:05.59]This is it.
[369:07.64]okay I'm gonna blame everything on that too because I don't know what the is wrong with computers are you mad I'm not mad I'm just disappointed I'm disappointed that I beat the level
[369:26.54]but I don't get a reward because there's an extra challenge that I've never seen before that you just lose to if you don't know.
[369:33.45]I didn't know.
[369:34.45]I'm disappointed.
[369:37.02]It's disappointing.
[369:41.00]I'm not mad.
[369:45.87]I'm just disappointed.
[369:46.77]How the fuck are you supposed to get up here without items?
[369:50.83]It told you what to do.
[369:51.57]You just didn't listen.
[369:52.43]I pressed the three buttons.
[369:53.72]I know.
[369:58.67]Uh, this run doesn't count.
[370:04.02]This one was a shit run.
[370:07.98]You were panicking?
[370:09.58]Yeah, dude, what do you want me to do?
[370:11.40]It's the first time I've ever seen any of that.
[370:13.35]And it's like, if you fall down, you lose.
[370:20.71]Of course I'm gonna fucking freak out.
[370:23.64]I don't know, I gotta go back.
[370:36.32]0.
[370:36.58]I guess I can keep going this way.
[370:43.12]I think this one's just right up.
[370:54.40]Right there.
[371:07.17]Alright, did anybody get that?
[371:09.71]We didn't hear any of whatever that just was.
[371:12.39]You gotta fix your fucking computer.
[371:30.55]I did beat Act 2 though, I did.
[371:32.83]And I know people are gonna say, no you didn't.
[371:34.26]Yeah, I did.
[371:35.37]I pressed all the buttons.
[371:36.19]I just... My computer broke when I... My computer fucked up.
[371:40.29]Sucks when that happens.
[371:49.48]Yeah, when you get, like, the notification, like, oh, there's an error.
[371:51.75]You guys heard the error.
[371:52.51]That's too bad.
[372:02.32]We heard it?
[372:02.68]Yeah, I mean, it is what it is.
[372:04.12]Sorry.
[372:12.15]That sucks.
[372:13.22]I'm so sad.
[372:16.54]I have no idea how sad I am.
[372:18.74]I'm like sad.
[372:19.67]There are tears streaming down my face right now.
[372:33.09]Hey, it was a PB, right?
[372:35.77]Right?
[372:36.01]PB.
[372:36.91]That's fine.
[372:39.58]I can get up there, can't I?
[372:41.80]I'll use the fucking barb.
[372:48.67]I killed them.
[372:51.50]You going through the five stages of grief?
[372:54.12]I'm going through the five stages of complete act two and then get sad.
[373:00.01]I don't know if there's any more stages.
[373:16.99]Alright, how hard do you think Ster laughed out loud when I couldn't get it?
[373:23.46]Do you think it was a full Ster belly laugh when I fell into the water?
[373:41.62]It was probably a halfway laugh?
[373:46.52]man I had it I'm gonna like think about this in the shower I'm gonna go to the dentist and tell my dentist no you don't understand what happened was I when you press the elevator button uh and the elevator comes down I thought it was just over like okay you made it to the end but there's another part that you have to do and I didn't realize that was kind of timed too
[374:15.41]And when I jumped over and finally get the third button, it's like, now where do I go?
[374:19.43]And I wrap all the way back around, but I'm on an even bigger timer.
[374:25.46]Oh, keep my mouth closed?
[374:27.06]Oh, because you want to drill.
[374:28.80]Okay, yeah, sorry.
[374:30.22]Yeah, okay.
[374:32.32]Yeah.
[374:32.44]Okay.
[374:36.75]Yeah, it's dangerous if I talk like that?
[374:38.11]Okay.
[374:38.69]If it's dangerous, I'll stop.
[374:41.53]Sorry about that.
[374:49.61]Dentist or you're a therapist.
[374:53.96]Listen, let me tell you.
[374:56.20]What a fucking week I had.
[374:58.50]See, I got to act too.
[375:12.69]What do we got here?
[375:17.64]How long does it take to do this?
[375:27.53]Do you think I can beat this game in eight minutes?
[375:37.39]If I just absolutely screw... No way.
[375:49.63]That would probably be about all the sewers.
[375:59.16]carrot is... I feel like I'm a carrot.
[376:01.60]I feel like I'm a carrot user.
[376:09.94]I'm kind of running.
[376:10.76]I don't really need all this food.
[376:13.18]Remember that?
[376:14.18]You guys remember?
[376:15.43]I did all that with no items.
[376:17.25]Not one.
[376:18.89]Oh, man.
[376:19.42]Remember that?
[376:20.79]Damn.
[376:22.25]And I got to the end of Act 2.
[376:23.65]Remember that?
[376:26.33]Damn.
[376:26.61]That was pretty good, wasn't it?
[376:28.00]That was, like, pretty good.
[376:31.90]I mean, like, come on.
[376:32.36]That was... Remember that?
[376:36.36]Uh, I'm gonna take another break.
[376:37.64]I'm gonna get a drink.
[376:39.09]This will probably actually be the last break I take.
[376:42.29]Uh, we'll see how well this goes.
[376:44.79]I am gonna say that I at least got to the end of Act 2.
[376:49.20]Okay?
[376:50.36]Be right back.
[376:52.82]The game is phenomenal.
[376:53.62]I think the game is amazing.
[376:54.80]I'm having so much fun.
[376:57.09]So, I don't know.
[376:57.75]Maybe this won't be.
[376:58.49]Maybe this will be the last break.
[376:59.86]We'll see.
[377:02.73]Don't trust anything I say going forward.
[377:04.85]But, probably.
[377:06.92]See you guys in a few minutes.
[380:31.62]How's it going?
[380:36.23]OK.
[380:39.17]So.
[380:42.51]I am OK.
[380:44.20]I'm I'm good.
[380:45.38]I'm ready.
[380:47.44]I ate a handful of pumpkin seeds.
[380:49.96]That's right, different seeds this time.
[380:54.65]Faster climbing speed and the thing moves faster.
[380:57.56]Got it.
[380:58.88]Got a pretty decent amount of items.
[381:00.94]I'm ready to blow this so badly that I end the stream.
[381:07.45]Sounds good.
[381:12.28]I'm not going to scream anymore.
[381:13.48]I'm going to get locked in and stay completely collected.
[381:23.53]I'm dead.
[381:48.26]Guys, I'm dead.
[381:57.21]They were kind of in a bad spot.
[381:59.53]I'm dead.
[382:00.51]I'm just fucking dead, I guess.
[382:02.44]Okay.
[382:12.15]What's the best way to deal with that?
[382:14.29]Do you just have to kind of hit them and you have to kill them instead of just trying to get up there?
[382:19.48]The wind blows you up too, so it's not like you can really control too much of what you're doing up there.
[382:27.15]But that was really anticlimactic.
[382:28.69]That sucked.
[382:29.89]Okay.
[382:30.39]Well, whatever.
[382:51.66]Okay.
[382:53.23]I don't think I can make that.
[382:58.03]I feel like I've done that same strategy like five times in a row.
[383:11.84]Give me one sec.
[383:31.79]Okay.
[383:43.83]He just did his taxes real quick?
[383:45.49]Yeah, I just gotta do my taxes real quick.
[383:52.84]Oh, man.
[383:55.48]That's so stupid.
[384:02.66]I don't want to spend any of this money.
[384:23.99]Fuck it, right?
[384:25.97]Fuck it.
[384:28.02]Respiratory protection advised.
[384:38.87]Yikes!
[384:42.38]There we go.
[384:46.24]Oh actually, actually yikes.
[384:49.47]Am I in trouble here?
[384:58.48]Oh, boy.
[385:02.00]I don't know, guys.
[385:02.95]I don't know.
[385:05.71]I don't know.
[385:06.31]I think it's... It's not looking good right now.
[385:12.76]I think the gamer fatigue is here.
[385:14.06]I need a fresh start.
[385:21.95]I need a mindset reset.
[385:25.77]I'm fulfilled.
[385:26.61]I got to the end of Act 2.
[385:30.13]No, I didn't get to the elevator of Act 2, but I beat Act 2 as a concept.
[385:39.22]You know what I'm saying?
[385:40.42]I'm happy with that.
[385:42.30]I completed Act 2 in concept.
[385:45.99]Well, in practice.
[385:47.03]In a theoretical practice.
[385:51.67]So I'm fine with that.
[386:08.83]I did it again.
[386:10.31]I like love this section for some crazy reason.
[386:21.24]That's a lot of bug money.
[386:35.54]I also beat Act 1 in theory.
[386:38.92]Well, to have beaten any of the acts in theory, you had to have completed all of the zone, but then got to the elevator and had a little bit of an issue, okay?
[386:53.59]If that's what you're talking about, then yeah, I would step my purpose on that.
[387:01.77]Could you beat Act 1 in prac- Act 2 in practice?
[387:05.42]That's what I'm going for.
[387:07.02]Cafeteria refrigeration units are operating at 2% capacity.
[387:13.58]Non-perishable rations are recommended.
[387:30.76]Getting a lot of money this run.
[387:47.08]Not bad.
[387:48.84]Not bad.
[387:53.57]I don't love the scenario that I'm currently in, but I'll just go this way.
[387:59.67]Good, okay.
[388:14.37]Let's be dumb.
[388:24.14]Just doing that dumb shit.
[388:31.76]Ah, getting heavy.
[388:35.01]Can you throw the hammer away?
[388:36.09]That would be so sad.
[388:36.93]Accidentally throwing the hammer down would be awful.
[388:40.58]We got blessed?
[388:41.84]Nice.
[388:44.08]Somebody's blessing us today.
[388:44.86]Who is it?
[388:45.73]Somebody blessing?
[388:47.87]Somebody gonna lead us?
[388:52.24]Wait, did I say you didn't?
[388:53.44]I'm just realizing that I screamed you guys didn't pray hard enough when I fell.
[388:58.71]Was that fucked up?
[389:02.83]That's quite a way to go.
[389:04.38]That's quite a way to go out.
[389:08.51]Screaming you didn't pray hard enough to a bunch of people while you do something very dangerous?
[389:13.14]That's pretty fucked up.
[389:17.88]You should have prayed harder.
[389:25.05]Oh, that's so stupid.
[389:28.28]I love it.
[389:31.90]This really kind of has been a scream stream.
[389:34.02]It just has been.
[389:35.18]I'm sorry.
[389:38.25]I didn't anticipate it to be that way.
[389:56.49]Saying that on your death bed surrounded by your family.
[390:04.72]Can I please pick the- Dude, you can't let me rip this.
[390:31.81]Don't go for it.
[390:40.71]You don't have the super jump right now.
[390:42.37]What did I just tell you?
[390:45.09]What did I just tell you?
[390:46.94]I told you not to do that, but you did it anyways.
[391:02.64]Huh?
[391:03.20]Wait, excuse me.
[391:05.35]I am just a little bit surprised right now.
[391:07.61]What the fuck was that?
[391:15.56]That shit was already coming up?
[391:16.60]I was moving so fast.
[391:20.10]I gotta get something rolling here.
[391:21.52]This has been three shit runs in a row.
[391:29.51]What the fuck is happening?
[391:41.15]At least I deposited the coins.
[391:43.46]Use one hand more often?
[391:46.08]I tend to.
[391:47.30]It just depends on where.
[391:48.26]I'm trying to just go through this first part really quickly.
[391:51.01]Which is a downfall.
[391:53.07]Because you just try to spam.
[391:54.25]Go, go, go, go, go.
[391:55.06]But that's never the right way to do it.
[392:16.71]Put those hands to good use.
[392:34.92]Okay.
[392:36.40]Very good.
[392:36.86]Looking good.
[392:40.83]Stop skipping.
[392:41.83]That's the problem I keep having.
[392:44.49]I'm trying to just jump over eight of them.
[392:47.36]Just grab this one.
[392:48.22]You got it, dude.
[392:48.90]Just don't worry.
[392:49.88]Just relax.
[393:09.19]Mm-hmm.
[393:23.75]Mm-hmm.
[393:23.91]Mm-hmm.
[393:24.07]Mm-hmm.
[393:24.25]Cool.
[393:26.13]Shall we?
[393:33.98]Got a lot of good items.
[393:35.58]Don't blow it.
[393:42.99]Why is this not in- I'm very confused.
[393:49.68]But we're doing- we're doing fine.
[393:50.86]We're having fun.
[394:03.18]Dude, can you please not?
[394:06.02]You're fucking this whole thing up.
[394:13.74]Like, I'm gonna just fucking javelin this piece of shit.
[394:16.08]Like, fuck you.
[394:18.22]Whoa, I just got an achievement.
[394:21.56]How is he still alive?
[394:22.61]I'm so shocked that it's... I'm... This might be the end of the stream.
[394:31.58]This has been almost seven hours of this.
[394:33.64]I don't know if I can do this anymore.
[394:42.25]A game like this, you come back supercharged and then you just... Yeah, I don't know.
[394:46.24]I'm not so sure about this.
[394:52.17]Will you just fucking die?
[394:55.03]Why is he still alive?
[394:56.33]I threw three rebarbs up his face.
[394:59.14]Okay, that's it.
[395:03.20]I'll see you later.
[395:04.75]I might be alive tomorrow or Saturday or something.
[395:06.81]I don't know.
[395:16.98]I lost three rebarbs.
[395:23.23]It's shocking that I haven't been killed by the goo yet.
[395:31.33]I'll take it, whatever.
[395:54.83]Okay.
[395:57.38]Excellent.
[395:59.10]This game is a 9.6.
[396:00.58]And it loses .4 points.
[396:10.25]It's a 9.5.
[396:12.87]It loses .5 points and lowering.
[396:20.42]Remember, my scale is... There's decay on my scale.
[396:26.77]I'm not liking other potential reviewers.
[396:29.23]There is decay.
[396:31.58]This is starting out at a 9.6.
[396:35.45]We'll see how the decay goes.
[396:51.64]My brain is decaying watching this gameplay.
[396:55.90]Alright, I'm going to have to defend myself a little bit here.
[396:58.67]I think I've done very well.
[397:01.49]I think I've done very well.
[397:02.24]First time playing, first like four, five, six hour session.
[397:05.38]I think I'm doing just fine.
[397:07.73]Why is this box nailed to the floor?
[397:09.97]I don't know.
[397:21.03]Hey, I got a DM from Stuart that said, Hey bro, just checking in to see how you were doing in the game.
[397:26.74]I actually caught the Act 2 fiasco, LOL.
[397:31.68]Keep it up, though.
[397:32.54]That's actually some of the better gameplay I've seen from somebody that has been... Oh, and I scrolled on.
[397:40.15]I'm still in the game, fuck.
[397:49.94]Oh, the fucking hammer gave me away.
[397:52.16]Okay.
[397:53.21]I'm sure he would say those things.
[398:03.81]Hey dude, I haven't watched in a while.
[398:05.13]Why do you have an Elmo laugh now?
[398:06.96]Fucking banned that guy for an hour.
[398:10.09]Regular maintenance for air exchange filtration is overdue.
[398:14.93]Filtration efficiency at 62%.
[398:17.40]Hey, for the first time in like 30 minutes I finally got here.
[398:31.37]I was actually wondering that too.
[398:34.17]Time that person up for five minutes.
[398:41.83]I don't need all this food.
[398:49.82]Can you do something with the notes?
[398:50.72]Is it a secret or something or no?
[398:57.73]Ster said you haven't even seen the coolest parts and then he did two PogChamp emotes, which is kind of cool.
[399:07.09]Hey, that's a real comment, right?
[399:09.48]Yeah, it is.
[399:20.22]Check that follow button if you follow the stream.
[399:24.25]I will.
[399:26.25]Typically stream sometimes.
[399:29.18]I'll tell you when I'm going to stream and then I'll just do it like three days after I tell you and then when that day comes I will push it like another day.
[399:38.23]So it's about four days, maybe five.
[399:41.74]And then I will do something fun.
[399:44.26]Smash that button.
[399:50.56]I definitely want this.
[399:59.15]This is what carried the last time.
[400:01.75]This stuff is so good.
[400:05.83]I'm happy with this.
[400:09.64]That's a rope.
[400:10.36]I got a brick.
[400:11.32]I'm going to throw that at one of those assholes for sure.
[400:18.27]OK.
[400:18.35]Criken raided really?
[400:20.72]Did I miss it?
[400:21.24]Was I in the middle of my bullshit?
[400:24.84]Thanks to the right Criken.
[400:25.64]Welcome everybody.
[400:26.10]It was like 10 minutes ago.
[400:27.17]Cool.
[400:30.20]Yeah, welcome if you are still here.
[400:32.04]Appreciate it too, thanks.
[400:34.25]And we're playing this.
[400:35.63]Highly recommend it if you haven't played it.
[400:40.00]This is a Ster recommendation.
[400:42.68]And those are usually good, so I had to listen.
[400:44.79]Everyone said, why didn't you play Oblivion today?
[400:47.49]A Ster recommendation is above Oblivion gameplay for me.
[400:51.70]so you'll see oblivion at some point hopefully that's not me lying to you but who knows I don't know maybe I'll play it I don't know I'm just doing whatever you're good we're good definitely want that I would rather that than this okay keep moving keep moving
[401:27.27]Almost screwed that up.
[401:39.07]Now let's examine what I did there.
[401:41.50]I don't know.
[401:43.58]I don't know why I did that.
[401:46.83]We can examine it.
[401:49.79]I don't know.
[402:27.77]Hooray!
[402:32.05]It's a hapoon!
[402:34.50]Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[402:35.58]Poon!
[402:36.30]Poon!
[402:46.51]Toon!
[402:49.76]It's a ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-toon!
[402:52.80]Toon!
[402:53.34]Toon!
[403:15.54]Don't.
[403:16.85]Thank you.
[403:22.02]Bro... I don't know if I can do it.
[403:48.75]Okay.
[403:51.88]Would you look at that?
[403:53.00]Sure.
[403:54.82]Alright.
[403:55.54]Eh, whatever.
[403:56.18]That's a brick, whatever.
[404:04.70]Okay.
[404:04.86]What are we going to do?
[404:06.82]I don't need this.
[404:12.06]Notice, decommissioned training modules in chamber 12 remain offline.
[404:18.28]Unauthorized reactivation is prohibited.
[404:37.95]What about one of these?
[404:44.17]You did it.
[404:47.33]Whoa!
[404:49.80]Everyone is doing fine.
[404:58.21]Come on, man.
[404:59.32]I didn't get it in the right spot.
[405:00.40]You gotta be shitting me.
[405:21.36]I don't have time for this shit.
[405:40.80]Let's go.
[405:42.86]Hey, I also recommend PoE 2... PoE 1 tomorrow.
[405:46.00]There's a new season.
[405:49.11]Uh, I'm currently into this game called White Knuckle.
[405:57.64]It's pretty fun.
[406:15.48]Got it.
[406:17.14]Alright, what's the perk?
[406:22.59]Alright, so this is actually the last shit that I'm going to do.
[406:25.49]This is the last attempt.
[406:27.19]On that Act 2, I was able to beat Act 2 in theory before.
[406:33.71]And now I'm going to try to do it to completion.
[406:52.33]Yeah, before we beat it, but I have to beat it in practice completely.
[407:06.71]That's good.
[407:11.28]Everything by 15%, but there's a warning on it.
[407:24.95]Is the morning... It's experiment... These other ones don't say that.
[407:30.82]It's flavor text?
[407:33.24]Okay.
[407:33.36]I think that's worth it.
[407:39.73]It's just fluff?
[407:40.39]Okay.
[407:41.15]Alright, we got a save point.
[407:42.50]I'm ready.
[407:43.22]I'm not taking a break here.
[407:45.04]I'm just going.
[407:46.54]I got really good items.
[407:48.18]This is a good run coming up here.
[407:49.75]I am a little tired...
[407:54.42]And that's the excuse I'm going to give you when I walk into the liquid in five seconds.
[407:58.26]Five, three, one.
[408:05.27]Alright, I'm going to be quiet.
[408:08.98]Wish me luck.
[408:13.70]Okay.
[408:51.34]Yep.
[409:21.39]Guys, hold on.
[409:22.27]Hold on.
[409:22.63]Come on, come on, come on.
[409:23.31]Stop it.
[409:43.49]Everything is sweating right now.
[409:44.70]My keyboard is wet.
[409:45.66]I'm not kidding.
[410:06.13]The Jompite is fucking this all up.
[410:21.92]I gotta do what I gotta do.
[410:35.19]Notice subzones 156 through 178 are being flushed.
[411:08.28]That's a hard jump.
[411:09.38]I hate that one.
[411:14.69]Okay, gotta do what you gotta do.
[411:15.59]Let's go.
[411:47.12]Excellent use of fucking terrain.
[412:20.40]Fuck.
[412:21.16]Fuck.
[412:22.17]Fuck.
[412:23.07]Uh-oh.
[412:23.29]Fuck.
[412:24.27]Fuck!
[412:32.75]Everything's fine.
[413:08.43]Alert.
[413:09.85]Micro tears in segment B piping detected.
[413:13.85]Potential seepage of contaminated water into substructure 5 is expected.
[413:47.00]Hmm.
[414:12.86]Stop being funny, game!
[414:41.05]Steam bullshit, we're almost done.
[415:01.41]Get up, get up, get up.
[415:17.49]Down!
[415:49.30]Yes!
[415:49.88]Come on, come on.
[415:50.52]Now I know what to do.
[415:51.24]I know exactly what to do now.
[415:52.32]Let's go.
[415:52.80]Come on.
[415:53.20]Give it to me.
[415:54.17]Let's go.
[415:54.59]Bingo.
[415:59.64]Pick up some shit.
[416:00.46]Pick up some shit.
[416:01.32]Pick up some shit.
[416:02.38]Pick up some shit.
[416:03.26]Go.
[416:05.15]Pick up some shit.
[416:05.95]Go.
[416:08.13]Pick up some shit.
[416:08.97]Go.
[416:10.90]I know what I gotta do.
[416:18.24]I got plenty of time.
[416:21.89]Walk in.
[416:29.82]Be slow.
[416:34.19]Be collected.
[416:35.17]And...
[416:52.68]Oh, that doesn't help me either, friends!
[417:03.98]Oh my god, what the fuck?
[417:06.28]Where's the elevator?
[417:07.34]Where's the elevator?
[417:08.11]What the fuck happened?
[417:09.09]Guys, how do I fix this?
[417:11.19]Where's the elevator?
[417:12.13]Can I go back in the elevator?
[417:15.62]Can I go back in the elevator?
[417:16.54]What do I... Can I go back in the... Is the whole thing fucked?
[417:21.11]That's a throw?
[417:21.79]Oh, no.
[417:23.48]Oh, that jump is so fucking long.
[417:26.06]Can I climb back up?
[417:30.53]I can... Okay, I see a spot right here.
[417:31.71]Hold on.
[417:32.71]It's not quite over.
[417:33.48]Wait a minute.
[417:37.94]Oh, that jump is so fucking hard.
[417:40.67]Hold on.
[417:41.11]Can I do it?
[417:47.22]I had it too.
[417:48.32]It's just fucking... It's so cooked.
[417:50.92]It's so cooked, guys.
[417:52.69]Oh, it's so fucking cooked up.
[417:54.95]It's so fucking cooked.
[417:58.37]Hold on.
[418:00.56]Come on, dude.
[418:01.36]Come on.
[418:01.88]I'm right there.
[418:09.35]Is this not... Is this cooked?
[418:11.71]Okay, I have to hit this.
[418:13.76]I fucking need this.
[418:21.32]Fuck.
[418:23.03]Guys.
[418:25.83]Guys, no.
[418:26.71]No.
[418:29.34]Oh, man.
[418:31.54]This hurts.
[418:32.46]This is painful.
[418:33.29]This hurts so bad, guys.
[418:34.79]Fuck.
[418:36.21]No.
[418:36.63]Oh, no.
[418:38.74]Oh, I just did the one little jump.
[418:42.64]I couldn't make it.
[418:45.00]It was like weirdly placed and I like just was so nervous and fucking god damn it No If you fall down there are you just like fucked forever?
[419:09.85]That's so sad
[419:14.08]That sucks such asshole.
[419:17.46]There's a pipe.
[419:22.70]You can get back up where the cargo is.
[419:25.99]I OK, the problem with that one.
[419:27.59]I took my time.
[419:29.21]That was a huge mistake.
[419:31.77]There is one jump that.
[419:36.48]It's alright.
[419:37.98]It's alright.
[419:39.86]That's hard.
[419:40.50]It's hard to get there and not throw it.
[419:43.23]It's just... There's so much pressure to make those little fucking... Because if you fall, you're fucking... You're fried.
[419:49.23]It's over.
[419:51.98]Let me try to get back up there.
[419:58.03]He went really fast, though.
[420:01.15]Yeah, I don't know if I'm going to be able to get up there again.
[420:02.81]I thought that was the one, too.
[420:05.36]It's just...
[420:06.46]Oh, I just wish it was not so hard.
[420:10.62]But it is, and that's just the way it is.
[420:13.80]Ah, my mouse is unplugged.
[420:31.08]That was annoying.
[420:31.84]Okay.
[420:33.46]I have no items.
[420:40.61]Oh, it's so painful.
[420:42.55]I thought I... Why can I... I've stood on this like a thousand times.
[420:45.78]Why can I not stand on it?
[420:48.02]What the fuck's going on?
[420:49.60]I've stood on this every time.
[421:04.08]I need items.
[421:05.90]I don't know about this one, guys.
[421:07.05]This one might be just as bad.
[421:14.58]Oh boy, that's not good.
[421:17.40]Something on me?
[421:18.97]No.
[421:19.05]Alright, here's like the missile launcher.
[421:28.60]I can't believe it happened again.
[421:29.94]I can't believe it.
[421:31.41]And I was like prepared for it too.
[421:33.13]That's the saddest part.
[421:35.31]I guess you're just not prepared.
[421:36.37]You just can never be prepared for it.
[421:37.98]Oh boy, this is fucking cooked.
[421:39.20]This is bad.
[421:39.72]This is actually bad.
[421:45.46]Hey dude, one, one, one minor error.
[421:49.69]GG, game over.
[421:52.07]You just can't make any errors.
[421:53.47]None.
[421:54.27]Zero.
[421:55.02]Zero.
[421:56.26]Boy, are you fucking screwed?
[421:58.14]And look at this guy.
[422:00.08]What's his deal?
[422:04.97]Are you kidding me?
[422:06.21]Get the fuck out of here!
[422:07.91]Hey!
[422:10.56]This is dog shit!
[422:11.70]What is this fucking crap?
[422:16.11]He's in the way!
[422:16.93]Get the fuck away from me!
[422:27.74]This is gonna be a Christmas miracle if I do this one, holy fucking moly.
[422:36.61]I already got shit up my asses, no way.
[422:42.48]All my energy was expelled trying to get up that fucking wall.
[423:01.74]Alright, I gotta keep- I gotta get more shit.
[423:03.90]I don't have any items.
[423:05.04]It's gonna be a sad day when I don't get up there!
[423:08.08]Honestly, if I get there again, I'm not jumping at all.
[423:25.12]Jumping is just death.
[423:27.50]You're just completely fucked if you jump.
[423:54.59]Okay, it's not bad.
[423:58.84]Could be worse.
[424:00.26]This part actually sucks.
[424:02.54]But I'll deal with it.
[424:04.36]I dealt with it before.
[424:08.89]Okay, so far so good.
[424:10.96]Elevator system malfunction.
[424:13.38]Do not use lifts.
[424:15.30]Seek alternate evacuation routes.
[424:28.17]Please?
[424:29.07]Thank you.
[424:30.89]I got no crutches this time either.
[424:32.27]I got no juice to drink.
[424:33.42]I got none of that.
[424:37.38]I really don't want to go that way.
[424:46.25]I can't use that drink as a crutch.
[424:52.76]Oh fuck.
[424:53.24]Don't know it.
[424:54.24]I gotta wait.
[425:00.99]Sit right here.
[425:02.91]I'm gonna go right side.
[425:11.58]It's okay.
[425:11.81]It's alright.
[425:12.27]Just chill.
[425:12.99]We're fine.
[425:14.97]We could be watch for us.
[425:20.62]Okay.
[425:21.00]Good.
[425:23.76]This is the worst part.
[425:36.97]Good?
[425:37.65]Let's go.
[425:46.96]Okay, what the fuck is going on?
[425:50.22]Just like getting caught on the lip.
[426:03.80]Stay right here.
[426:04.14]I have any food?
[426:09.76]Alright, this one.
[426:10.92]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[426:14.02]I'm chill.
[426:22.53]Okay, okay, okay.
[426:23.35]Hold on a second, dude.
[426:24.28]Eat this fucking thing right now.
[426:30.70]Dude, come on.
[426:34.73]That just saved the whole run right there.
[426:36.21]Honestly.
[426:36.41]Honestly.
[427:26.84]Come on, we're so close!
[427:47.13]Bro!
[427:49.03]Hello!
[427:49.75]Hello!
[428:02.33]Dude, the steam is so fucking annoying!
[428:06.44]God, it's un-fucking-bearable!
[428:16.43]The shi- I had- I had to go!
[428:18.33]He steamed?
[428:31.56]Steam lasts too long.
[428:38.82]Steve lasts too long.
[428:40.19]It needs to be two seconds shorter.
[428:44.79]I'm going for a speedrun.
[428:49.51]Okay, Steam does too much damage.
[428:50.69]I said it.
[428:52.14]Steam does too much damage.
[428:53.46]Steam does too much knockback.
[428:54.76]I said it.
[428:55.50]You heard me say it on stream.
[429:03.69]I said it.
[429:04.81]Steam does too much damage and too much knockback.
[429:07.13]You heard me.
[429:33.67]I don't know how I grabbed that
[430:10.92]Hey, quit your game?
[430:15.50]Uh, I have... I'm not done.
[430:20.55]I'm almost done.
[430:23.22]I love this game so much.
[430:24.14]I just keep getting to that point.
[430:27.08]Okay, think about it.
[430:29.79]You know when you play an Elden Ring boss, and you get him down to one hit, and you go, oh my god, I want to fucking puke?
[430:39.91]And then you get there again and you get him down to one hit again.
[430:42.24]And then it's just like, okay, now I'm going to puke twice.
[430:46.49]It sucks.
[431:14.67]Alright, go to items.
[431:26.66]Bro, you need to play some more chill games.
[431:30.39]I'm having fun.
[431:31.15]I mean, I love it.
[431:32.17]I think it's great.
[431:40.22]I'm obviously very addicted to it at the moment.
[431:42.95]Because the problem is I've had no conclusion.
[431:46.04]You know what I mean?
[431:46.66]Like, I've had a fake conclusion two times now.
[431:53.29]You get to the end and it's like, no, you're not at the end.
[431:56.01]And then you have to stressfully do this.
[431:57.50]And then I would have, the stream would have been over two hours ago.
[432:01.30]That's like, okay, beat level two, whatever, that's fine.
[432:11.16]Fucking hit it!
[432:13.09]God, guys.
[432:13.87]It's because Jax jumped off a cliff.
[432:38.62]This game is fucking rancidly hard when you get to those points where you have to panic.
[432:49.42]This game is fucking rancid.
[433:10.42]Stop.
[433:16.35]Stop it.
[433:34.33]How red can the hands get before they explode?
[433:37.64]Um, it actually takes a while.
[433:39.76]It's a lot longer than you think.
[433:45.27]Alright, I'm going to... This is actually the last break of the night.
[433:48.21]I promise you.
[433:51.07]And who cares even if it's not?
[433:53.02]But, yeah, this is going to be it.
[433:55.12]I'm going to take my last break.
[433:56.14]I'm going to be ready.
[434:00.61]And I'll be back.
[434:01.51]Whatever happens during this run here, it's GG.
[434:05.07]It's over.
[434:06.49]Whatever happens.
[434:07.15]Doesn't matter if I lose at the same spot again.
[434:08.76]Doesn't matter.
[434:23.82]GG.
[434:45.52]Emergency evacuation protocols remain disabled.
[434:50.86]Proceed at your own risk.
[436:34.52]Emergency.
[436:40.44]Fire suppression systems offline in sector four.
[436:45.34]Manual intervention required.
[437:17.86]I just got back.
[437:18.36]People saying, am I not safe because I didn't pause?
[437:20.04]Uh-oh.
[437:21.30]That's not good.
[437:24.58]I think I'm fine.
[437:33.10]Alright, what's the perk?
[437:39.00]What the fuck?
[437:42.69]200... You can't walk?
[437:49.88]Hey, this is a buck face run.
[437:50.98]This is the end of the stream.
[437:51.83]Oh, that's horrible though.
[437:57.31]Yeah, that is not good.
[438:03.84]I think this is bad.
[438:07.95]Well, let's find out.
[438:11.75]I don't like it.
[438:12.87]I actually don't like it.
[438:16.60]Oh well.
[438:20.28]Maybe it'll work out.
[438:21.18]Maybe it'll work out.
[438:22.04]We'll see.
[438:39.74]I don't know about that.
[438:40.69]I don't like it.
[438:41.45]This isn't gonna be GG.
[438:42.53]I'll see you guys maybe tomorrow or Saturday.
[438:48.66]I don't like it.
[438:49.74]I'm sorry.
[438:50.76]I don't.
[438:51.98]I like the game, but I don't like this perk.
[438:54.59]It's too fast.
[439:01.44]Did every single.
[439:04.96]Oh, it's wrong with me.
[439:06.70]OK, let's go.
[439:09.63]Oh boy.
[439:18.12]I mean, it is lightning fast.
[439:24.67]Attention.
[439:26.12]Facility power levels critical.
[439:29.62]Main reactor failure detected.
[439:33.25]Oxygen systems running at 85%.
[439:37.27]Dude, what the fuck?
[439:44.01]Stop, it's too fast.
[439:54.19]Yikes.
[440:06.63]What is it?
[440:07.09]Get over here.
[440:08.49]Get over here, you little bug.
[440:15.16]Where's this bug?
[440:23.99]Why did I go for the one furthest away?
[440:27.01]Is there a way I can light up this shit to make it brighter?
[440:32.28]I want rebarbs and I want red things to be brighter.
[440:35.20]How do I do that?
[440:35.68]Can I do that?
[440:36.14]Like, I didn't see this one.
[440:37.56]And I just got hit by the bug that I was mad at.
[440:39.84]Just hit me.
[440:40.30]45 minutes later.
[440:47.53]What the fuck are you doing?
[440:48.73]He's been on my head!
[440:55.29]Alright, slow down.
[441:01.30]See you later.
[441:02.10]God damn it.
[441:07.66]Come on, man.
[441:08.83]Come on.
[441:10.97]Oh, well, I got to act two theoretically in practice twice.
[441:14.93]I beat act.
[441:15.59]Well, no, no, no.
[441:16.23]Not that I got there.
[441:17.78]I beat act two theoretically in practice twice.
[441:26.32]This one's just for fun.
[441:45.46]I'm never going to fucking forget this.
[441:48.76]This game is going to just stick with me because I didn't... You know when you just don't do it and you're just like, I need to do it.
[442:01.39]Alright, Ster, are you still here?
[442:04.15]What was your scale for me to... Act 1 meant what?
[442:07.34]Act 2 meant something else.
[442:11.08]If I beat it.
[442:11.74]Which I did.
[442:12.62]I did.
[442:13.64]So, what is the... I will be playing this game again.
[442:24.61]100%.
[442:26.28]I actually might even just stream it the next time I stream.
[442:28.70]Who cares, right?
[442:29.42]Let's go.
[442:35.24]I'll be fresh.
[442:36.58]I'll be rested.
[442:38.08]I'll be ready.
[442:39.23]I'll be excited.
[442:46.56]Fuck the steam.
[442:48.90]It's shooting things.
[442:50.52]I don't like those.
[442:51.08]I don't like those.
[443:10.34]I said my hero if you get to part three.
[443:13.27]My savior if you beat it.
[443:14.75]But what about part two and part one?
[443:21.37]Because I beat part two theoretically in practice.
[443:41.07]I'm just happy that you saw the elevator.
[443:44.37]Oh, okay.
[443:45.74]I got some points there.
[443:56.75]I will beat Act 2.
[443:58.13]I have to.
[443:58.90]Maybe not right now.
[443:59.68]This is just like a who cares.
[444:00.86]I'm not even playing.
[444:01.74]I'm not playing the game run.
[444:25.54]Yeah, I'm not even playing.
[444:26.84]I'm just checking something out.
[444:29.22]Just testing my buttons.
[444:43.53]My buttons are working.
[444:44.37]They seem to work.
[444:46.15]I don't know yet.
[444:46.57]I gotta figure it out if they work all the way though.
[444:53.87]I don't know.
[444:58.78]I feel like they might be okay.
[445:01.31]We have to check it in Act 2 though.
[445:03.05]Act 2 is where you can tell the buttons work.
[445:45.19]Button got fucked up.
[446:00.20]Just in case I die for some reason, just deposit.
[446:03.49]What?
[446:03.71]25?
[446:04.33]I had like 40.
[446:06.75]What the hell is that all about?
[446:13.00]I had like 30 something, didn't I?
[446:16.88]Some perks... Oh, that's right, right, right.
[446:18.88]I spent them.
[446:35.64]Nice.
[446:39.44]What we got?
[446:40.42]Big perk coming up.
[446:41.30]Something huge.
[446:51.89]I didn't love that before.
[447:03.03]Do I have a timer for this?
[447:04.99]Or do I have to just kind of guess?
[447:10.85]I have a lot of rhubarbs.
[447:14.82]Is it just 10 minutes starting right now?
[447:16.00]Or should I... I gotta go.
[447:20.67]Okay.
[447:20.79]Well, I'm just gonna go.
[447:23.09]Alright, whatever happens, this is the part where stuff usually gets going.
[447:27.32]Something happens or something doesn't.
[447:28.50]I'm just moving.
[447:31.82]Either it does, either it is or it isn't, right?
[447:37.93]Either it is or it isn't.
[448:02.13]That was a disaster.
[448:05.53]Total disaster.
[448:11.54]I'm at that stage where, like, everything is wet.
[448:13.60]Like, I'm sweaty and everything.
[448:14.78]And all my buttons are, like, I'm pressing them too hard and too soft.
[448:19.65]Yeah, it's all gone down.
[448:21.81]It's all fucked up now.
[448:32.59]Honestly, okay, okay, okay, this is bad.
[448:35.21]You know what?
[448:35.87]I... Okay, if you could see my mouse, it is like wet.
[448:40.81]It's like covered in grease.
[448:44.00]It's covered in grease.
[448:44.92]Like, I had to let go of the mouse because it was uncomfortably covered in what is human liquid.
[448:57.93]Now I know why people wear those like gamer gloves.
[449:02.66]Alright, this is it.
[449:03.62]Last one for real.
[449:12.06]Maybe we should get one of those.
[449:13.29]You know what I'm talking about?
[449:14.13]The ones that leave the finger open.
[449:21.00]Well, I love the game.
[449:21.82]The game is very hard.
[449:23.88]I'd say it's very unforgiving.
[449:25.39]Especially considering that you have to start the whole thing over, even if you beat an act.
[449:29.91]You get one retry.
[449:32.28]Which, that's brutal.
[449:34.38]That's brutal.
[449:36.70]I'll tell you, that's brutal.
[449:40.35]But, I feel like I've learned enough of the first act where it's not that big of a... It's really not that problem.
[449:47.80]The first act is not that bad.
[449:50.04]It can be at the last part, but.
[449:56.80]It's a roguelike.
[449:58.71]Am I getting permanent?
[449:59.87]I don't think I'm getting like permanent upgrade, so am I?
[450:02.24]I guess I'm unlocking things.
[450:22.81]The best run by far was there was one where I had no items and I just somehow just powered through it.
[450:30.97]I wish I could just like no clip into that room and just look at that wall.
[450:36.07]That's my problem.
[450:36.56]My problem getting to the end of Act 2 is just like I want to look at that.
[450:40.54]I want to study that wall for a minute.
[450:42.65]But you can't.
[450:43.37]You got to go.
[450:51.11]There's the fir- that first jump.
[450:52.67]That's gonna get me every fucking time.
[451:13.87]But I will do it the way that the developer intended.
[451:17.00]I'll get there.
[451:17.48]I've gotten there twice and it was just- I fucked it up.
[451:25.22]I'm definitely crossing up left and right click sometimes now.
[451:28.88]It's been seven and a half hours.
[451:30.12]What is going on?
[451:31.96]Have I been streaming for seven and a half hours?
[451:36.83]What the fuck happened?
[451:38.29]I thought it was like four and a half hours ten minutes ago.
[451:45.52]Oh, well, well.
[451:45.94]Cool.
[451:46.64]Alright.
[451:52.99]You can't go out on a loss though, right?
[451:58.48]Dude, that PB was sick though.
[452:00.17]Remember that PB?
[452:01.63]Get the fuck outta here.
[452:05.96]You guys remember that PB?
[452:06.88]Wasn't that sick?
[452:09.65]Remember we were all like PB?
[452:11.19]Oh man.
[452:13.70]It was cool.
[452:25.53]Somebody said Burger XD.
[452:28.31]Ban that person for a whole day.
[452:46.29]Why are these all red?
[452:50.82]That was a good placement, but anyway.
[453:02.45]This is just a stupid run.
[453:15.93]I mean, I made it, whatever.
[453:20.98]OK, well, I guess I did it.
[453:31.46]Remember I told you I have a decaying scale?
[453:33.92]So this was a 9.6 to start.
[453:35.65]It is now a 9.4.
[453:36.81]There was a little bit of decay there, but it's okay.
[453:49.18]Alright, stop doing that.
[454:16.41]That's fickle.
[454:17.92]Fickle Andy.
[454:20.04]I mean, it has an opportunity to go back up.
[454:22.96]It is decaying every it is.
[454:26.11]I need to upvote it.
[454:27.63]Do you know what I mean?
[454:30.01]And I've failed a few times in a row here, so it didn't get any upvotes from me.
[454:34.44]So it continued to decay.
[454:38.56]Still a 9.4.
[454:39.28]That's pretty damn good.
[454:50.23]What the hell happened?
[455:11.57]Damn it.
[455:12.55]That stinks.
[455:17.11]Is it a 9.2 now?
[455:18.13]No, no, that was my own problem.
[455:20.82]It's a 9.4.
[455:21.52]Every time I got hit by the steam and it knocked me 500 feet back, that was a .1 deduction, I will tell you.
[455:30.27]So it was a 9.6.
[455:31.01]Steam.
[455:32.50]What the fuck?
[455:33.20]9.5.
[455:34.94]Back up.
[455:35.26]Steam.
[455:36.46]9.4.
[455:44.82]Now that freezes right now.
[455:47.00]This doesn't decay.
[455:48.29]For another, like, four days.
[455:55.26]They actually nerfed the steam from the demo.
[455:57.78]That's funny.
[456:01.83]Points can be added back.
[456:08.40]I hope you didn't hear that.
[456:10.94]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[456:12.36]That's gonna be it.
[456:14.89]Thanks for watching.
[456:15.95]I love it.
[456:16.69]I think it's a wonderful game.
[456:17.72]I think it's amazing.
[456:19.54]I think that is a... I feel like it's been a while since I've cared about wanting to beat a game.
[456:28.71]Or wanting to complete an area.
[456:31.25]I kind of didn't care that much about anything that's released.
[456:36.21]Night Rain was fun.
[456:37.08]I mean, I've been playing it off and on.
[456:40.02]But...
[456:42.70]I don't think I love Night Rain.
[456:45.53]I think Night Rain is good, but it's not the kind of, oh my god, I can't wait to do it again and again and again and again and again.
[457:07.22]I still do like it, though.
[457:08.24]I think it is a great foundation for a game that could have a ton... Look, stamp this post right here.
[457:17.72]Hold on, I have to post something.
[457:21.78]Okay, stamp this.
[457:23.27]I think a year or two from now, there's going to be a ton more interesting things to do in Night Rain.
[457:28.85]And I think it'll be a far better game.
[457:36.65]Not that what's there is bad.
[457:37.81]It's just, I think when it has more, I think it'll be a 10 times better experience.
[457:45.00]Will people care about it that long?
[457:46.26]That's a good question.
[457:47.74]Depends on what they add.
[457:55.61]Yeah, I like want to keep playing this game, but I got to go.
[458:01.36]I'll see you guys soon.
[458:02.22]Maybe stream tomorrow.
[458:03.72]Maybe I'll just play this tomorrow.
[458:05.19]If not, then maybe on Saturday or Sunday.
[458:07.43]So you'll see this again during the weekend.
[458:10.29]You might see it tomorrow.
[458:11.05]You might see it Saturday, Sunday.
[458:12.62]We'll see.
[458:15.28]Loved it.
[458:22.23]Take care.
[458:22.83]See you soon.
[458:23.25]Call your mother.
[458:24.39]You know what to do.
[458:26.29]Have a good one.
[458:28.47]See you later.
[458:29.28]It was a fun day, too.
[458:30.16]I had a lot of fun today.
[458:32.12]That was like a full-on gamer session.
[458:33.88]I feel good.
[458:38.51]See you later.
[459:24.97]you
