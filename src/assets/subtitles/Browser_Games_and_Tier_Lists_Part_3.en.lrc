[ve:61.7.100]

[00:00.77]Hey Good afternoon, how are you?
[00:16.33]Am I on time finally you're on time I'm on time too just barely
[00:23.35]You were sitting there, looking out the window, waiting for, like, the electrician to show up in the window, and it was, like, 3.58.
[00:28.95]And you're walking back and forth, pacing, like, this is un-fucking-believable.
[00:36.39]Where is he?
[00:37.79]Should I call?
[00:38.29]I'm gonna call the manager.
[00:40.31]And you have the phone in your hand, and right at 3.59, the truck pulls up, and you're like, God, you made it.
[00:48.18]Okay, you made it.
[00:51.64]But here's the thing, it took me like four or five seconds afterwards to put my pants on.
[00:57.67]So I'm like sitting here putting my pants on like getting ready to come in here and I technically it's like 4.02 right now.
[01:07.60]But the truck pulled up at four.
[01:15.98]Get your pants on.
[01:20.26]Dude, I swear to God.
[01:23.04]So Twitch... Let me tell you something about like something that just makes no sense.
[01:27.38]So if I stream to the test server, like the Twitch test server, I don't... I drop like no frames.
[01:37.46]The second I actually press the go live button and stream to the fucking actual Twitch, I drop a thousand frames.
[01:46.10]What the fuck is this?
[01:49.24]It doesn't make any sense!
[01:54.34]There's a test server to make sure that your stream is gonna work.
[01:58.36]And instantly, I was running that for like an hour, and fucking instantly, to the same server, I actually turned the stream on, not going to the test server, and 10% of all streams are dropped.
[02:13.87]What?! !
[02:16.52]They're the same server.
[02:18.38]It's the same server.
[02:19.40]I gotta talk to Twitch about this.
[02:20.38]Because that makes no sense.
[02:25.92]Why on Earth would I drop the amount of frames that I dropped in an hour of testing to Twitch's server?
[02:32.20]This test server is the same server as the one I'm streaming to right now.
[02:36.73]Huh?
[02:39.53]What the fuck?
[02:46.02]Maybe Twitch can help me route it somewhere else.
[02:47.90]Oh my god, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[02:52.43]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[02:58.29]This is really really really fucked up.
[03:01.25]I wish I had any idea why this is happening.
[03:06.87]The second I actually go live...
[03:11.23]It's going to the same place, Twitch!
[03:13.63]What's happening to me?
[03:15.03]Why is this happening?
[03:19.90]It makes no fucking sense.
[03:21.58]Nobody can tell me why this is happening.
[03:30.15]Well... Anyways... Hey, I know how to fix this problem.
[03:35.41]Hurry up and turn on the fucking facecam.
[03:37.98]Nobody will remember your 2,000 drop frames in 10 minutes.
[03:43.79]Not even 5 minutes.
[03:45.09]This is like as bad as it's ever been.
[03:46.63]I got a black t-shirt on?
[03:49.01]What?
[04:07.23]I'm just staring at it for a little bit.
[04:08.63]This is a calm stream, so nothing matters today.
[04:15.15]Your webcam is 60 FPS?
[04:16.79]Nah, it's because I tweaked it.
[04:26.41]Is this stream canon?
[04:29.15]No, none of my streams are canon.
[04:30.91]They're all extended universe.
[04:38.75]I'm outta here.
[04:39.19]I'm out.
[04:42.93]Oh, I'm outta here.
[04:45.89]Why?
[04:46.15]There's no fucking logical reason for this shit.
[05:09.66]Anyways, hi guys, welcome to the stream.
[05:14.37]It's been 3,000 frames so far.
[05:20.76]To the same server I was just streaming to.
[05:25.16]I was just streaming to the Los Angeles server.
[05:31.60]but not broadcasting out to users.
[05:34.62]And I press the fight to delete the fucking test broadcast button, and go live with a regular Twitch to the same server, and it's fucked.
[05:52.31]Oh my god.
[06:00.79]Would I look good with one of these?
[06:04.70]Like one of these little hairs?
[06:06.14]What do they call this?
[06:19.66]Try it under the nose.
[06:20.50]Would I look good with one of these?
[06:21.48]It's like Saturday morning cartoon villain.
[06:37.23]What if I was bent a little?
[06:40.89]Which fucking, like, moron Mario cousin am I?
[06:44.23]Hold on.
[06:56.66]I ain't leaving.
[06:57.08]I ain't fucking going anywhere.
[07:00.03]With the power of my mind, I'm going to make this work.
[07:06.87]Alright, I'm gonna, like, pass myself out.
[07:08.75]Don't do that.
[07:12.94]It's the Jim Carrey Robotnik.
[07:18.34]Here's the good thing about this, though.
[07:21.90]This is just a calm stream.
[07:24.45]But that doesn't matter!
[07:25.67]I want this to fucking work!
[07:30.83]Pack it up.
[07:32.13]Pack it up, I'm moving.
[07:35.04]Packing up, putting everything in a box.
[07:36.40]I'm fucking out of here.
[07:46.66]Just get all my shit in a box.
[07:48.30]I'm fucking out of here.
[07:54.15]I'm going somewhere with fiber.
[08:00.47]Doesn't mean I need to leave Las Vegas, by the way.
[08:15.89]Fucking 4,000 drop frames in nine minutes.
[08:20.35]I don't think I've dropped 4,000 drop frames in two hours last night.
[08:23.11]Do you understand how this makes no sense?
[08:25.77]Like, is anybody in here like a networking person to even describe to me why last night, this is not even 24 hours ago, it's green for fucking like six hours straight.
[08:36.98]And then now, it's like it can't even breathe.
[08:41.65]Like somebody's strangling it right now.
[08:46.08]It doesn't make any sense.
[08:53.61]And now we're at zero.
[08:54.33]Let me try something.
[08:58.29]Let me try something.
[08:58.73]Nobody move.
[08:59.19]Everybody stay there.
[09:05.24]Getting throttled.
[09:05.94]This is a $400 a month business line.
[09:10.12]They don't throttle those customers.
[09:12.15]They can't.
[09:14.29]This is like a Cox business line.
[09:18.57]It's not throttling.
[09:19.79]Speeds are fine.
[09:20.73]Hold on.
[09:21.01]I'll be right back.
[09:22.77]I'll be right back.
[09:24.55]I'm going to try a different server.
[09:50.23]I have no fucking idea.
[09:56.56]It got like exponentially worse.
[10:05.30]Oh, if I wasn't like a nice human being, I would scream as loud as I could right now.
[10:12.93]It would just be like, it would reverberate.
[10:15.73]It would reverberate like back and forth over all your ears.
[10:21.77]I would peek, I would not, I would, yeah, you ever see, um... Okay, you ever see Kung Fu Hustle?
[10:29.27]Where the lady, like, takes the whole drag of the cigarette and, like, blows out the whole, like, like, the block and all the windows and stuff by screaming?
[10:37.33]That's what I would do right now.
[10:48.94]I'd do a comb scream.
[10:52.24]But it has to get better.
[10:53.96]It's gonna get fucking better.
[10:55.04]It always does.
[10:55.68]I'm fucking cursed forever.
[11:01.50]I have to be cursed.
[11:02.38]There has to be a curse put on me.
[11:07.20]Somebody take it off.
[11:09.02]Take it off.
[11:10.56]Take this curse off.
[11:11.72]Take it off.
[11:23.49]I will, I will go bring like, I'm gonna bring like fucking incense in this house.
[11:37.18]I'm gonna, I'm gonna fill this room with fucking incense.
[11:40.74]And I'm gonna conjure up the internet demon.
[11:43.32]And I'm gonna sign the bottom of the paper.
[11:44.70]It's gonna be like, are you sure you like want to sell me your fucking soul to have like stable internet for like a while?
[11:51.47]Yes.
[11:52.25]Yeah, I don't care.
[11:52.91]Do whatever you want with it.
[11:56.37]You're sure about this?
[11:57.21]Like, most people ask for a fucking trillion dollars or like a billion dollars.
[12:00.57]No, no, no.
[12:01.09]I don't care.
[12:02.70]Well, holy shit, I'm making out like a bandit.
[12:14.16]No, I know.
[12:14.62]It's going to be worth it.
[12:15.44]Look, I...
[12:19.66]Wait, you don't want to, like... Wait, you don't want, like, world peace?
[12:24.25]I do, but... Fuck, I need that internet!
[12:27.13]I need that internet to work!
[12:30.83]I got a real long name!
[12:56.84]I don't know what to do.
[13:01.90]I'm just gonna go... I'm not leaving yet.
[13:04.66]I might switch another server.
[13:13.51]I'm blinking.
[13:14.45]Look at how much I'm blinking right now.
[13:17.59]The amount of blinks per second.
[13:22.75]Oh my fucking god.
[13:33.06]Hey, we've been up for 4 minutes and I've only dropped 20% of every frame that's been broadcasted out to you guys.
[13:40.46]Un-fucking-believable.
[13:55.38]Have you seen any good movies?
[14:10.12]It's a literal slideshow.
[14:15.88]Wow, did you guys really just respond to that?
[14:18.24]How long did that take to get to you guys?
[14:32.13]I'm going to try one more thing.
[14:34.57]Hold on, I'll be right back.
[14:37.42]Pause everything.
[14:38.56]Hang tight.
[14:39.12]I'll be back in like five minutes.
[14:41.62]I'm going to try one more thing.
[14:44.00]And then I'm going to scream into my pillow.
[14:46.82]And like cry.
[14:47.88]I'm going to like scream crying into my pillow.
[14:50.85]Like instantly.
[14:51.59]You know like instantly scream crying.
[14:54.21]That's what I'm going to do.
[14:55.03]I'll be right back.
[14:58.29]Give me five, ten minutes.
[14:59.17]I'll be right back.
[14:59.61]I'm going to try again.
[15:07.90]I'll be right back.
[15:09.32]I'm gonna try.
[15:12.20]Hello, hello, hello.
[15:13.74]Hello!
[15:15.98]We've got some testing to do.
[15:17.90]We're gonna do some testing!
[15:22.93]Are you ready?
[15:25.33]Because... This tree might have like a 10 second delay on it.
[15:33.56]Are you ready?
[15:35.58]I'm gonna snap my fingers.
[15:37.79]And you tell me when you hear it.
[15:39.25]Ready?
[15:39.65]In the chat.
[15:40.21]And I want to say... You have to say, I heard it.
[15:42.61]Ready?
[15:49.27]Really?
[15:50.88]Do it again.
[15:51.22]Ready?
[15:52.78]So this time you're going to say...
[15:55.34]What?! !
[16:02.95]Okay, so what has happened in the time that I have not been here?
[16:10.34]I have done a few things.
[16:13.18]I have downloaded and set up a packet loss prevention VPN.
[16:24.48]And, strangely enough, I think it worked!
[16:33.74]Look at this.
[16:36.28]It's green.
[16:37.46]It's green.
[16:38.70]It's been green for like 25 minutes.
[16:41.76]Okay.
[16:43.90]I'm telling you.
[16:45.32]I will tell you the company's name.
[16:46.74]Okay, here's the thing.
[16:48.33]Hold on, hold on.
[16:49.97]If we get like a couple days of complete green video, oh, I will give this company as much attention as they want.
[17:03.49]I will shake the goddamn CEO's hand on camera.
[17:08.29]I will shake their hand on camera and take, like, fucking president photos with them.
[17:20.56]Because seriously, like, if this works, it's been hell trying to get this to be fucking fixed.
[17:26.72]It might, we may still drop frames.
[17:31.13]But I don't know if it'll be as awful as it is.
[17:37.15]I don't know.
[17:37.65]I'm willing to try anything.
[17:42.22]Did it cost anything?
[17:43.22]It was free to try.
[17:47.60]And the amount of data that I'm going to be obviously pumping through, it costs money.
[17:53.21]But here's the thing.
[17:54.99]This service is...
[17:58.60]This service is not free after you do it for a while.
[18:01.76]Actually, it's free up to a certain point.
[18:05.03]But let's just stream and see what happens.
[18:11.07]Let's just do a live stream and see what happens.
[18:17.89]But I will tell you, it is cheaper than you think.
[18:24.41]It is, okay, for a whole year of this service, it is cheaper than buying one Nintendo Wii game.
[18:35.98]If that gives me a green fucking bar for a year, that's worth it.
[18:52.53]It is a pay service.
[18:56.67]How much is a Nintendo Wii game?
[19:00.05]A Nintendo Wii game is $50.
[19:10.74]So, in my opinion... In my opinion... What's happening... What has been happening... Well, I don't know.
[19:17.82]This is obviously too early to talk about this, but... If this is fine, and it's back to normal...
[19:25.75]then the issue is about routing the connection.
[19:29.85]Somewhere along the way, Cox has these routing fucking problems to whatever servers I'm trying to go to.
[19:40.17]But, I'm not gonna, I'm just gonna, let's just turn over, let's just go.
[19:45.41]I'm not gonna tweet this out yet, because I want to make sure that, I want like 10 minutes of green.
[19:52.21]I had the exact same problem a couple months ago and my VPN fixed my problems too.
[19:58.07]And this is specifically, this is a packet loss preventing VPN.
[20:04.28]I don't know where the fucking data's going.
[20:09.78]At this point, I could fucking care less where it happens to it.
[20:16.11]I don't care.
[20:17.43]Does it work?
[20:20.28]Oh, hold on, a VPN might be, like, sniffing out a... I don't give a shit.
[20:24.98]Is it green?
[20:25.62]Do we have a green light?
[20:31.22]I didn't even get a chance to comb this fucking hair once on camera.
[20:38.03]And now it's, like, it's too, like, corroded.
[20:41.95]My hair is too corroded.
[20:43.19]It was wet.
[20:50.31]You're giving people your so- no, it's just, it's like, what, okay.
[20:55.43]It's a credit card, and it's a service that's reviewed very highly.
[20:59.86]Okay?
[21:02.20]This is not a low reviewed service.
[21:06.02]It has pretty decent numbers.
[21:13.76]No, it's fine.
[21:14.50]It's gonna be fine, okay?
[21:18.82]I'm not giving... Look at this hair!
[21:20.56]And I didn't even... This is supposed to be a combs frame today.
[21:24.19]No drop frames in fucking almost ten minutes.
[21:27.09]Are you kidding me?
[21:31.03]Are you kidding me?
[21:31.59]And I got like a big zit over here that I'm not gonna show you.
[21:37.86]You downloaded a virus.
[21:39.24]Well, this virus sure does make my internet work better.
[21:43.64]Okay.
[21:44.34]I don't care.
[21:46.18]Well, what if it's like sniffing out your packets?
[21:48.06]Oh, good.
[21:48.38]I don't give a shit.
[21:49.16]Whatever.
[21:50.02]You're gonna see me go to, like, fucking... Like, my mail and open up, like, my bank.
[21:56.27]Actually, that's probably bad.
[21:57.09]I'm gonna do that.
[21:57.46]Okay, from now on, I'm gonna open up my bank account and stuff on my phone.
[22:06.58]Oh, shit!
[22:07.48]Maybe I should, uh... No, but honest to God, what?
[22:09.52]They're gonna see me play, like... What, so they're gonna see what Steam game I bought yesterday?
[22:14.80]Not that I don't have a very fucking crazy life.
[22:18.67]But I'll probably end up just doing everything on my, like, phone now.
[22:27.14]You have protected traffic.
[22:28.68]Exactly.
[22:29.34]I'm fine.
[22:30.06]Everything's fine.
[22:30.88]I am just like kind of... I'm pretty manic right now.
[22:33.42]I've got like pretty like big... I got like mania right now.
[22:36.30]Because this is almost 10 minutes of no drop frames.
[22:39.38]And it was like 20 minutes of no drop frames before I actually turned the stream on.
[22:42.58]I'm going through this service and you'll get a name soon.
[22:45.37]You'll get a name soon.
[22:53.17]I don't know why I'm holding back.
[22:54.19]I'm holding back the name because if this drops to zero in like the next 20 minutes and like it didn't even do anything, you'll get the name soon.
[23:02.49]Don't worry.
[23:07.35]Nice hair.
[23:09.19]I've got it all wet and ready.
[23:15.41]Get an affiliate link.
[23:17.24]I don't even know if they do that.
[23:22.25]You're gonna break the spell if you say the name.
[23:23.93]Yeah, I'm not, I'm not, no, I'll never say the name.
[23:29.63]This is a good sign, though.
[23:32.01]Let's see if we, uh, if we stick with it.
[23:35.27]So, uh, anyways, uh, you almost just saw the zip.
[23:38.75]That's, that's, no, I don't want that.
[23:40.43]So, hold on, let me turn the camera off for a second.
[23:45.31]Show the zip.
[23:46.05]No, you'll see it randomly, it's huge.
[23:52.41]He's getting stress zits.
[24:05.37]What's actually happening tonight?
[24:07.21]Okay, I have a bunch of web pages open.
[24:10.09]I have the tier list open.
[24:11.83]I have an online Rorschach test.
[24:14.93]I have a personality test.
[24:16.25]I've got cool math games.
[24:17.53]I had a whole thing going.
[24:22.99]Do you think it's right to tweet out?
[24:30.86]Once we get 10 minutes of green, I'm doing it.
[24:32.24]Alright, let me write... I'm going to write green.
[24:43.42]And then put my Twitch link.
[24:47.42]I'll be the happiest boy in the world if this shit actually, like, completely mitigates the problem.
[24:54.04]But you can't have completely perfect internet.
[24:57.58]It's impossible, no matter where you are.
[24:59.50]But, like, drop in, like, a hundred frames here or there, drop in, like, you know, a thousand frames, like, every, like, hour or so, but that's fine.
[25:07.39]If this service gives me that, I'll shake the CEO's hand on camera.
[25:15.70]Alright, well, we got... I can do it.
[25:17.08]Alright, let's go.
[25:27.07]Come on, stay up.
[25:27.79]Let's do this.
[25:29.19]I will shake you.
[25:30.35]Whatever... Okay, so whoever the CEO is.
[25:33.73]Whoever you are.
[25:35.37]I don't... You know, the CEO of this company.
[25:37.07]You know who you are.
[25:37.65]Maybe you don't.
[25:38.39]You don't, because I haven't said the name of the company.
[25:39.89]But when we meet...
[25:42.94]I'm gonna give you, I'm gonna shake your hand, and we're gonna, like, go in, and I'm gonna, like, I'm gonna give you, like, the dad on the day of the wedding.
[25:50.66]Like, the, well, the, the, here comes the bride and, and, and, and the dad, and they walk down the aisle, and then he shakes, he shakes the groom's hand.
[25:58.49]And he leans in, and he always, like, says something.
[26:00.57]He whispers, like, a bunch of encouragement.
[26:02.15]That's, I'm gonna do that.
[26:03.57]I'm gonna be like, there it is!
[26:04.47]There's gonna be, like, fucking flashes everywhere.

[26:38.09]There's like fucking 10,000 cameras.
[26:46.92]Those are flashes, cameras.
[26:50.04]We got no drop breaks.
[26:53.22]Set up the meeting.
[26:54.32]Set up the meeting.
[26:57.38]Those are cameras.
[26:57.98]What are you talking about?
[26:59.18]Flashes of cameras.
[27:00.02]What are you fucking talking about?
[27:05.16]Alright, let's just get it out of the way so people, like, just stop asking about it.
[27:08.90]There it is.
[27:11.76]That developed in less than fucking 40 minutes.
[27:21.07]Oh!
[27:27.32]Oh!
[27:28.08]My shit just popped!
[27:32.28]Hey!
[27:32.94]Hey!
[27:33.90]It's fine!
[27:34.34]Everything's alright!
[27:35.16]We're good!
[27:37.76]Give me that!
[27:38.89]Give me that fucking hand back!
[27:40.97]What have you done?!
[27:45.49]Get off of me!
[27:55.97]It's fine!
[27:56.49]We're fine!
[28:02.77]That was like a little dip.
[28:03.75]That was a little dip.
[28:07.77]That was a little dip.
[28:09.47]That was just a little, little like, ooh-ooh.
[28:19.78]Just little dips.
[28:24.92]Imagine, like, okay, so, like, this is the scenario.
[28:27.14]If we drop, like, 10,000 frames right now, it's like, oh, set up the meeting with the fucking CEO.
[28:31.75]Set it up.
[28:33.03]Pull it up in, like, the limousine.
[28:34.39]And, like, he's getting out of his limo, and there's, like, 10,000 reporters.
[28:38.65]And, like, all of a sudden, I look at my phone, and I have, like, 10,000 dropped frames.
[28:41.63]And I'm just like, oh, shit.
[28:45.63]Ah, we're going to cancel the meeting.
[28:47.55]We're going to cancel this meeting.
[28:54.87]What is this?
[28:59.13]What have you linked me?
[29:00.33]I don't want you to see my zip.
[29:02.85]No, don't touch it.
[29:03.53]It'll make it worse.
[29:09.58]It was the rival VPN.
[29:16.82]Cox, help.
[29:17.52]One of the world's funniest people, Jerma985, is having internet issues.
[29:23.07]And there were 5,000 people excited to watch his stream.
[29:27.37]Is there anything you can do?
[29:29.55]Cox Customer Care, please have them send us a tweet so we can investigate.
[29:33.60]Guys, this doesn't do shit.
[29:36.32]These, like, customer care lines on Twitter are bots.
[29:46.51]They're not real.
[29:47.85]I don't think that's a real person.
[29:53.89]Because I'll tell you, you want to see the hierarchy of support with these internet companies?
[29:58.04]It's like, here you go.
[29:59.04]Ready?
[30:01.56]Ready?
[30:01.82]Here we go.
[30:02.22]At the top.
[30:03.34]CEO of Cox, it's infrastructure.
[30:06.94]This is the guy that owns the company, okay?
[30:09.19]Then there's like the other people, like the other employees that are underneath that guy.
[30:15.09]They're like suits, right?
[30:16.49]Executives, board members, executives.
[30:19.21]These guys just play golf.
[30:21.13]They don't even know what's going on.
[30:22.29]These guys just like play golf and like drink expensive whiskey.
[30:25.53]They don't do anything like that.
[30:26.63]They don't like, oh, what's happening?
[30:27.74]What's happening on that street down in Vegas?
[30:30.60]No, that guy, he doesn't care, right?
[30:33.30]Let's turn this off because I don't need any more of this.
[30:36.61]So underneath that, okay, underneath that you've got, so here, there's that.
[30:43.10]That's block one.
[30:44.10]Here's block like two, three, four, five.
[30:47.71]So that.
[30:48.77]Those guys will never know my name, right?
[30:51.37]Why would they?
[30:52.42]Underneath that, you've got like the supervising team.
[30:56.08]And these are the people that like actually have to pay attention and take care of things, right?
[30:59.16]And there's like a million, there's like millions of customers.
[31:03.24]Okay, so avoiding this, showing this is it.
[31:06.33]You're very observational.
[31:08.87]Yes, you are.
[31:09.81]We're doing the profile today.
[31:11.35]Let me just get it out of the way.
[31:12.69]Okay, there.
[31:23.27]Take a screenshot of this.
[31:28.77]Now take a screenshot of this.
[31:34.94]Those are the same people.
[31:41.68]That was the same person.
[31:48.11]You are fat.
[31:50.91]Don't push me today.
[31:52.91]Because I might rip these fucking handles off the chair.
[31:55.06]Somebody asked what kind of chair I have?
[31:56.44]I don't know.
[31:59.92]Fucking staples, whatever it is.
[32:05.10]Oh, anyways, okay.
[32:05.90]So, here is the rest of the pyramid.
[32:11.95]That's not to say that this is a pyramid scheme, but I'm just saying.
[32:14.03]It's like shaped that way.
[32:15.94]Whatever.
[32:16.78]So, you've got underneath like the supervising team, you've got the guys that come out in the truck.
[32:22.10]Okay?
[32:22.82]Guys that actually fix the nodes and they do the neighborhood work and they do the maintenance and they work hard.
[32:27.36]They do because they travel around all over the place.
[32:29.20]They've got tons of fucking complaints.
[32:30.94]That's like the supervising team.
[32:31.96]Then underneath that, you've got like the techs that come out to reset your modem.
[32:36.60]That just reset everybody's modem and that's all they do.
[32:38.84]They just go out and they go, oh, I guess you need to reset your modem.
[32:40.96]Okay, there's that.
[32:41.64]That's like down here.
[32:42.22]There's like a lot of that.
[32:43.94]Okay, underneath that...
[32:46.21]Underneath that is the phone support.
[32:49.70]And I'm talking about what people can do, right?
[32:51.62]I'm not saying that any job is more or less valuable.
[32:54.66]What I'm saying is the guy in the truck can do way more than the person that's on the phone down here, right?
[33:02.27]So the person on the phone that you call customer support,
[33:06.29]is what they're capable of doing is telling the guy up here to do something about it.
[33:11.33]One of those people here.
[33:12.77]That guy then has to tell somebody up here to get actual, do some stuff in the truck and get it worked on, right?
[33:17.83]That guy then has to talk to one of the fucking suit people to find out if they need to do more infrastructural work, right?
[33:22.90]That guy then goes into the fucking throne room with the guy with the gold throne and he's sitting there like this.
[33:31.29]I imagine the CEO just sitting on like a golden throne, like a king.
[33:35.65]And the peasants have to come in and be like, oh, excuse me.
[33:39.49]Oh, kneel before sire.
[33:42.17]Over on Wumbledoon down the street, we have 10,000 dropped frames, sire.
[33:51.08]It's hard for us.
[33:52.02]And he just sits there like, 10,000 dropped frames.
[33:57.15]Oh, that's pretty bad.
[33:59.19]But, you know, over there in fucking England, too, whatever we're going to call it, they had 25,000 drop frames.
[34:05.77]And they have to make a decision, right?
[34:08.19]So then I get up and I've got like the... Look, I'll do the other side so it makes more sense for you.
[34:14.09]Sire, you have so many drop frames and my family needs to use the internet and go to Amazon and buy cases of ocean spray...
[34:24.63]juice because that's and small small figurines of venom we need to and then he gets he looks over and he finally makes a decision right so when that determine when that person has said it's 20 minutes by the way only 400 drop frames that's not bad so my point is the person on Twitter
[34:51.38]I'm talking about what they are capable of doing what they're capable of doing if I were to send a tweet to cox customer care Twitter or the guy that drives the bus down the road I think this person would be able to do more for me that person would come out and probably like oh something's wrong there I don't know but I I
[35:26.27]What do you mean that... Alright.
[35:35.39]I'm going to be serious here.
[35:36.47]I'm going to be real.
[35:38.00]Get the comb out of my hair.
[35:40.56]Do not leave these people alone.
[35:42.60]Don't do that.
[35:43.30]Don't harass any employee.
[35:45.40]That's not cool.
[35:46.42]Don't fucking do that.
[35:47.52]You guys are better than that.
[35:48.78]But I really don't think...
[35:51.87]that I have people up here that are currently aware of it.
[35:59.68]My point is that that process starts all over again.
[36:06.87]The people that are on the phone that are down here somewhere that have to relay and relay and relay, I've already done that seven times.
[36:15.25]We've already relayed to the supervisor, to the field supervisor, to the real supervisor.
[36:20.45]They know.
[36:21.09]They know.
[36:22.09]They know the problem already.
[36:24.33]So going to the Cox Customer Care Twitter is essentially calling Cox Customer Care on the phone and being like, hey, my internet just turned off for the first time.
[36:36.48]There are people up here that already know.
[36:40.08]Did you tell them that I'm Jerma985?
[36:44.02]No.
[36:47.71]Have I changed providers?
[36:48.87]I haven't.
[36:49.41]I can't.
[36:50.17]You can't.
[36:50.79]There's only like two.
[36:59.69]Alright, so, but all bullshit aside,
[37:06.85]This is 22 minutes.
[37:08.83]I think I can start the stream now.
[37:16.94]Okay.
[37:20.04]So you're saying that you don't enjoy... It's not... Let me get this on the screen.
[37:26.43]It has nothing to do with the people that are working...
[37:33.33]Forecocks they can't like there's only so much that they can do it's not like their fault.
[37:39.37]It's not their problem.
[37:40.56]It really isn't It's how I've been explained this like a thousand times by various people and you know, let's just find out who I am as a person Shall we?
[37:56.39]That's
[37:59.57]Who are you?
[38:01.15]How we doing?
[38:01.65]We good?
[38:03.15]I think we're good.
[38:04.87]Alright, let's... I combed my hair like twice.
[38:10.25]It seems to be better.
[38:12.73]He's going... He's very manic right now.
[38:19.89]Where is it?
[38:20.23]Where is it?
[38:21.13]Is it not on screen?
[38:25.37]Hello?
[38:26.79]Let's find out who the fuck I really am.
[38:28.98]This is what we're gonna start with.
[38:47.95]What a transition.
[38:50.39]Like, I'm fucking unhinged, talking, yelling, and making noise.
[38:55.20]What kind of personality do I have?
[38:57.90]He's already fucking losing his mind.
[38:59.60]Alright, let's do it.
[39:01.20]Let's move on.
[39:06.11]What do you guys think I'm gonna be?
[39:10.61]Do chat's personality.
[39:11.73]We can do that.
[39:13.83]This is a comb stream.
[39:16.85]And this is how a comb stream works if you're brand new to the channel.
[39:21.84]It's just like, you know, we're just like hanging out.
[39:27.47]I don't fucking know, okay?
[39:28.61]Like, look, I just spent the last, like, 45 minutes crying.
[39:32.37]So I'm trying to, like, get back into, like, I'm live mode.
[39:37.57]And sometimes you can't do that.
[39:39.69]Alright, here we go.
[39:40.63]Here we go.
[39:40.97]I was just screaming crying into a pillow.
[39:42.75]Just give me a break.
[39:44.01]Here we go.
[39:45.27]I drank all the coffee.
[39:48.07]Fast and easy.
[39:48.77]It's going to take, like, 40 minutes.
[39:50.27]It's not going to take 12.
[39:52.37]I'm going to answer these questions as truthfully as I can.
[39:56.91]Okay?
[40:01.59]I'm not going to bullshit.
[40:02.73]I'm not going to lie.
[40:04.51]I'm going to go piece by piece.
[40:10.26]You're going to get the real me here, okay?
[40:12.54]Do you enjoy vibrant social events with lots of people?
[40:15.42]Yes, I do.
[40:19.98]I love talking to people.
[40:21.66]I love complaining about the internet to people.
[40:24.26]Pretty much every conversation I have nowadays with other people is about either the zit that's on my face or about an internet problem that I'm currently having.
[40:33.57]So, yeah.
[40:34.49]No, I love talking to people.
[40:35.29]I do.
[40:37.79]You often spend time exploring unrealistic yet intriguing ideas.
[40:42.51]All the fucking time.
[40:47.34]There are streams that I have tried to do that just completely unrealistic were never ever going to happen, but I tried anyways.
[40:58.19]I have like stuff on my mouth.
[41:00.81]Am I like frothing at the mouth?
[41:04.95]Am I like turning into like, am I turning rabid?
[41:09.09]Ow.
[41:09.91]This is what I'm talking about.
[41:10.57]I can't like comb my hair on these streams now.
[41:13.27]My hair's turning into like uncooked ramen noodles.
[41:20.31]Okay, your travel plans are more likely to look like a rough list of ideas than a detailed itinerary.
[41:31.24]I'd like to have some kind of plan, but not completely outrageous.
[41:38.75]I feel like I'm getting these wrong, because they're all agree.
[41:41.01]Alright, no, no, no.
[41:41.59]Okay, that's correct.
[41:42.61]I do.
[41:44.23]I like to just kind of go and do... I like to plan... Oh, hold on.
[41:46.52]I plan some stuff.
[41:49.62]But not everything.
[41:55.88]Some stuff is really, really highly planned.
[41:58.56]And I would say more than... Yeah.
[42:03.06]You often think about what you should have said in a conversation long after it's taken place.
[42:09.74]No.
[42:10.98]No, I don't... I don't give a shit.
[42:14.94]I mean, I'm not one of those... Okay, hold on.
[42:16.66]I'm not one of those people that's just like... No, because I... Look, I just say the things I say.
[42:26.49]I don't think about long after the conversations of what I should have said.
[42:32.41]No, I've just said it.
[42:35.77]What about years later?
[42:39.50]your friend is sad about something your first instinct instinct is to support them emotionally not to try to solve their problem well it depends on what they're sad about like okay if it's let's say it's like a like a little kid like drops the ice cream on the ground just go I can go get another ice cream and there it is and it you're it's not I just solved your problem in a minute right what kind what but what like let's see
[43:11.67]That's a bad parent?
[43:14.59]Wait, what do you mean, bad parent?
[43:18.75]Hold on, so if your kid dropped a full ice cream on the ground, you wouldn't go get him another one?
[43:26.82]What if they were like, okay, what if the worker didn't get it in there well, and it just fell out?
[43:33.98]And the worker was like, oh yeah, you're right, I didn't secure the ice cream in there good enough.
[43:50.04]The ice what what?
[43:53.58]Alright besides that you didn't secure the ice cream You have to take them with you to develop what what just don't drop it Because I would buy my son or daughter an ice cream that they dropped on the ground or try to get another one that makes me like a crazy person I
[44:25.60]about it alright but uh I would I would do that first I would just try to support and then maybe like how do we maybe fix this right yeah people can rarely upset you it depends on the day
[44:54.38]Cause like, I don't know, some days, some days somebody could like hit me in the face with a door and I'd be like,
[45:03.95]You know, well, people are, people are, there's blood all over my mouth.
[45:07.11]People are clumsy, you know, it's okay.
[45:08.63]Don't worry about that.
[45:09.87]Have a wonderful rest of your day.
[45:12.13]You need anything?
[45:12.91]Like some days it's like that, but other days somebody could literally sneeze like 15 tables over and I'm just like, stop, don't fucking sneeze.
[45:23.82]I don't know.
[45:25.20]Got it.
[45:25.82]I caught that.
[45:26.26]You know what I'm saying?
[45:30.20]It's not like, it depends on the day.
[45:33.00]That's probably right in the middle.
[45:41.61]sometimes you just are irritated sometimes you're just like having a good day no it no right in the middle alright let's go next page I'm only 10 of the way through this it said 12 minutes
[46:05.01]You often rely on other people to be the ones to start a conversation and keep it going.
[46:08.51]No.
[46:09.57]Strongly disagree.
[46:10.29]I'm always, like, throwing out fucking shit to talk about.
[46:12.45]I'm always just like, hey, what about this?
[46:15.85]What about that?
[46:16.49]What about this?
[46:17.15]What about that?
[46:19.47]So, yeah, I always want to start conversations.
[46:24.41]If you have to temporarily put your plans on hold, you make sure it is your top priority to get back on track as soon as possible.
[46:36.80]Mm... Mm-mm.
[46:39.62]No.
[46:40.82]Unfortunately.
[46:43.27]Mm-mm.
[46:44.15]Not that... disagree, but I... They come back to normal.
[46:48.79]They gradually come back.
[46:51.11]You rarely worry if you made a good impression on someone you met.
[46:54.73]So, like, I don't really worry if I make a good impression.
[46:59.54]Mm... I wouldn't say that's a strong agree.
[47:05.08]Because, like, I...
[47:07.25]I don't know.
[47:07.59]I don't really think about that too much.
[47:09.93]But not that completely, oh, I don't give a shit.
[47:12.29]You know what I mean?
[47:17.61]No, I think that's correct.
[47:21.09]You always talk about people coming in here for the first time.
[47:25.48]This is my first time watching and you suck.
[47:28.32]Well, that's interesting because you have a four month sub-batch.
[47:32.64]That would be very odd.
[47:38.28]God, I'm... Did you see that vein?
[47:41.98]Is that healthy?
[47:46.06]That was big.
[47:47.32]That means I'm healthy, right?
[47:48.24]That means like there's a ton of blood going up into my brain, right?
[47:52.42]Okay.
[47:53.96]No, that's great.
[47:54.74]It would be a challenge for you to spend the whole day... No, it would be a challenge for you to spend the whole weekend all by yourself without feeling bored.
[48:02.90]Yeah.
[48:06.18]I can't.
[48:07.02]I have to, like... I have to, like, be somewhere.
[48:09.61]I have to be with somebody.
[48:12.37]Something.
[48:16.21]Yeah, that would be a challenge.
[48:19.59]Maybe not that much.
[48:20.63]Because sometimes you do want some alone time, right?
[48:28.71]Okay.
[48:28.95]You are more of a detail-oriented than a big-picture person.
[48:32.97]No.
[48:33.05]No.
[48:35.32]I just, I'm a big picture.
[48:38.34]You are very affectionate with people you care about.
[48:41.82]Yeah, I think so.
[48:44.18]Somewhere in here.
[48:48.12]You keep asking us about the answers for your personality.
[48:55.39]Yeah, but I mean, come on.
[48:56.49]10 minutes, by the way.
[48:59.83]You have a careful and methodical approach to life.
[49:02.17]Absolutely not.
[49:04.17]You are still bothered by the mistakes you made a long time ago.
[49:10.65]No, I... No, I... Oh, shit!
[49:17.98]Strongly!
[49:19.02]No, um... What about the book?
[49:28.58]No, people... You grow, you know what I mean?
[49:31.68]You grow.
[49:36.05]You learn, you grow, and you become the person that you are.
[49:43.09]No, I kind of disagree.
[49:49.27]At parties and similar events, you can mostly be found farther away from the action.
[49:55.26]I don't know.
[49:57.62]Does this imply like the dance circle at the wedding?
[50:02.54]Because like, okay, I love the dance circle at the wedding.
[50:06.77]But I don't really like when it gets too crazy.
[50:13.22]You know, the dance circle of the wedding is fun.
[50:15.04]And then you're like, alright, I want to go back over to the bar and just sit around and watch.
[50:19.10]So, I don't know, probably like right here.
[50:23.00]Jeremy lied about the clown car.
[50:24.06]I just gave five community subs.
[50:25.97]Thank you.
[50:29.51]That's five community subs.
[50:32.05]Right now.
[50:35.90]It's a fucking lot.
[50:37.40]Thank you so much, Jermalight, about the Cloncar.
[50:40.88]Big subs.
[50:41.26]Don't look at that.
[50:42.86]You often find it difficult to relate to people who let their emotions guide them.
[50:51.22]Somewhere in the middle.
[50:51.91]I don't know, because sometimes... I think there needs to be a balanced approach to stuff like that.
[51:03.69]Maybe a slight disagree.
[51:09.16]Because I'm fairly emotional for certain things.
[51:19.22]Oh, it said don't answer neutral.
[51:20.50]Yeah, that's right.
[51:21.37]I did one neutral.
[51:25.57]I know.
[51:26.19]I'm trying not to answer neutral.
[51:29.35]I slightly disagree.
[51:31.43]When looking for a movie to watch, you can spend ages browsing the catalog.
[51:34.53]No.
[51:35.71]Nope.
[51:37.52]I just, I don't care what it is.
[51:38.66]I'll pick something for fun.
[51:42.06]Here's the thing.
[51:42.54]I actually do this thing.
[51:43.32]This is fun to do.
[51:44.63]The next time you're on Netflix or you're on Hulu, doesn't matter, right?
[51:48.69]A fun project is to find a movie that you've never seen that you'll never watch.
[51:53.89]That you're like, I will never fucking watch.
[51:56.15]There's no reason why I'm going to watch The Other Guys 2, right?
[52:00.20]I'm not going to.
[52:01.04]I'm not going to do that.
[52:02.58]There's no reason why I would do it.
[52:03.80]There's not a movie I'm going to pick to watch.
[52:06.12]If it's on TV, I'm not going to watch it.
[52:08.20]But what you do is you do the 20 skip.
[52:11.91]And how that works is you start the movie.
[52:14.39]And you watch for about 60 to 120 seconds.
[52:18.15]And then you skip 20 minutes.
[52:19.81]Watch for about 60 seconds.
[52:21.82]Skip 20 minutes.
[52:23.24]Watch for 60 to 120 seconds.
[52:25.40]Skip 20 minutes.
[52:27.18]And you'll get essentially the 20 skip of the whole movie.
[52:31.99]And you'll be able to, like, just take it in.
[52:34.29]You'll be able to see at least seven to eight minutes of a movie.
[52:37.40]And you're not going to watch this fucking movie anyways, so just have fun and just skip through it and just see what they do.
[52:41.40]Just look at, like, the weird shit they do on camera.
[52:48.56]You're fucked up.
[52:49.22]No, but I'm not going to watch that movie.
[52:50.16]Like, I'm not going to watch that movie, okay?
[52:53.38]Think of movies that you've scrolled through on Netflix that you're just like, I will never click that because I'm not going to give an hour and 45 minutes...
[53:02.70]to um what the hell was the name of that movie the last one I did this with was uh it was a will ferrell and mark walberg movie and it was uh what the hell was it they were like dad's home daddy's here dad's home too dad's home too right what was it called dad's here what is it called
[53:32.19]The dad?
[53:32.67]Where are the dads, too?
[53:39.72]No, somebody knows what this is.
[53:41.46]Daddy's home, too, right?
[53:45.06]No, not stepdad.
[53:50.19]No Gibsons in this movie.
[54:05.86]I'm pulling that hand away ever so slightly.
[54:11.68]Saved.
[54:16.07]Daddy's Home 2.
[54:16.55]Okay.
[54:20.17]We're good.
[54:20.49]We're good.
[54:21.47]So Daddy's Home 2 is the last one I did this with.
[54:25.09]And I would do it again because there's no way I'm going to give two hours to Daddy's Home 2.
[54:30.45]I watched like nine minutes of this movie and I feel like I've already seen it.
[54:35.74]There's a Dad's Home 1.
[54:36.98]Yeah.
[54:37.86]So no, I just pick shit and just watch it for fun.
[54:40.29]Sometimes it doesn't matter what it is.
[54:42.79]You can stay calm under a lot of pressure.
[54:45.47]Yeah.
[54:46.77]Strongly agree.
[54:48.85]But I can stay real fucking calm.
[54:51.93]Now don't say that the internet problems are cracking under pressure.
[54:56.66]Because the internet... Okay, listen.
[54:58.04]The internet problems... That's not pressure.
[55:01.46]That is... That is like...
[55:05.63]That's not even pressure.
[55:07.37]That is just extreme stress.
[55:11.35]You know what I'm saying?
[55:13.45]It's not just, oh, well, something's happening today that I got to be calm about.
[55:18.56]This is literally somebody just like throwing darts into your chest for like a year.
[55:23.76]Eventually, you're going to be like, can you stop throwing fucking darts at me?
[55:28.44]Like, you're going to have like 700 darts go into my chest.
[55:34.53]This is like getting 700 darts thrown at you over the course of a year.
[55:38.92]I walk out the door, like this is, you live a completely normal life, and I open the door sometimes, and there's just the, there's the dart guy.
[55:46.30]And he's just lining up the shot, and you're like, okay.
[55:49.12]Go ahead.
[55:49.78]And he's just like, hold on, don't move.
[55:53.86]And it bounces, it doesn't go, it's not gonna, he didn't throw it hard enough for it to go in.
[55:56.20]It just hits you in the chest and it falls down.
[55:57.56]And you have like a mark.
[56:00.10]That happens, by the way, this happens like two or three times a week.
[56:04.99]after a year you're gonna like kick out the dart guy you're gonna be like don't fucking get don't come in my house ever again he's gonna look at you like what don't don't don't leave don't ever come back get the fuck out of my house and he'll just be like with his bag like his bag of fucking darts on his back like okay
[56:26.41]Alright, bye.
[56:27.53]You'll never see me again.
[56:28.35]And you're like, yeah, get the fuck out of here, dart asshole.
[56:31.94]Okay, fine, bye.
[56:32.62]You'll never see me again.
[56:33.78]The door closes and he's gone.
[56:35.34]By the way, two months later, a dart hits your window.
[56:40.56]And you look out and you're like, that motherfucker.
[56:42.06]And he's just like... And he fucking runs away.
[56:49.17]He never leaves you alone.
[56:50.27]So after a year of that, you're probably going to be pretty annoyed with the dart guy.
[56:55.66]But, I mean, yeah, I'm pretty good under pressure.
[56:58.38]Somebody just gave 50 bucks.
[57:00.04]Who was it?
[57:00.40]Don't look at that zip.
[57:02.42]It was Ryan Hoggs gave $50.
[57:04.52]50 bucks.
[57:12.32]Slenderman kinda quirky.
[57:15.06]Kinda hittin' that.
[57:15.88]What is this?
[57:21.68]Slenderman kinda quirky, kinda hittin' that.
[57:24.37]What's that mean?
[57:26.73]I don't know what that is.
[57:30.83]I'm not gonna read that.
[57:37.31]Does that mean anything?
[57:42.54]That zit is taking up 80% of your face right now.
[57:50.32]Why did you read that?
[57:51.10]I don't know what that is.
[57:54.03]Somebody could have just wrote random fucking words.
[57:56.94]I don't know.
[58:01.88]Another $50 just came in from Frost Throw.
[58:04.02]These bits are for your funny joke.
[58:06.80]That's 50 bucks from Frost Throw.
[58:10.02]Thank you to the both of you.
[58:11.22]There's $100 in fucking two minutes.
[58:17.41]12 minute test, by the way.
[58:18.25]Yeah, but we have to like interact and talk about this.
[58:20.11]I have to go.
[58:21.69]Let me comb my hair for an hour.
[58:26.49]What funny joke?
[58:27.11]Did I say a joke?
[58:30.17]By the way, you can always tell how far back somebody's hairline goes if you really pull it.
[58:36.29]That's not that bad.
[58:37.09]I'm 30 fucking 4.
[58:38.19]Give me a break.
[58:38.61]I'm not like 20.
[58:43.04]Like, honest to God, this hair looks pretty good for a fucking 34-year-old man.
[58:47.96]Give me some slack.
[58:50.20]Seriously.
[58:52.66]You know how many fucking 35-year-old men I know that their hairline goes back to here?
[59:00.54]I think I deserve a little bit of slack.
[59:05.63]Okay, when I'm 40, this will probably be all the way back.
[59:08.49]Yeah, I mean, I'll be 40 though, whatever.
[59:11.79]You can't look like fucking 25 forever.
[59:14.41]I ain't gonna get any work done.
[59:20.62]I mean, you know, maybe I'll get like a, you know, that's not true.
[59:22.70]Maybe I might get like a chin implant when I'm like 45.
[59:25.74]I'm thinking like a, like a, like a double, like a two, like a chin implant.
[59:33.48]And then like a eyebrow bone implant because I would look like a banana.
[59:40.40]Ryan Hoggs also gave five community subs.
[59:44.76]So thank you for that.
[59:46.18]30% of the way through this test, by the way.
[59:50.04]Five more subs coming.
[59:51.10]Thank you, guys.
[59:53.04]When in a group of people you do not know, you have no problem jumping right into the conversation.
[59:56.77]I can do that very easily.
[59:59.63]I just go like, hey.
[60:02.05]I scroll on like this.
[60:03.71]And everybody notices that you did that.
[60:04.91]And they're like, who's this guy?
[60:05.84]Who's this guy?
[60:06.36]Funny?
[60:07.46]And then I go, kind of.
[60:08.60]And I get in there and I just start talking about whatever.
[60:11.16]You got to get in there like this.
[60:12.12]Here's a good icebreaker.
[60:13.54]Like, oh, we're at a party.
[60:14.58]And just like, rolling.
[60:16.70]Hey!
[60:18.88]Everyone's just like, oh, this guy might be like a funny guy.
[60:25.04]Don't do that, by the way.
[60:28.29]Yeah, but I can.
[60:30.23]When you sleep, your dreams tend to be bizarre and fantastical.
[60:33.35]Does this count as like crazy nightmare shit?
[60:39.11]I had a dream a couple nights ago that there was this big, gigantic, thick pane wall of glass.
[60:47.48]And there were like three or four people around me.
[60:50.09]I don't know what they were doing.
[60:51.27]They were like just hanging out, right?
[60:53.93]And they were taking turns trying to run and jump and break the glass with their bodies.
[60:58.99]This was like as big as a whole wall.
[61:00.67]Like a mural of just glass.
[61:02.31]And I'm just like, what are you guys doing?
[61:04.85]They're just like, yeah, come on, man.
[61:07.21]And like running, like making a dent.
[61:09.31]Bang!
[61:09.73]And like the little spiderweb would break out.
[61:12.30]And then finally, after like probably six or seven more attempts of this, one of them actually got through.
[61:16.96]It was like... He broke through and he fell back and landed and like... He got like cuts all over him.
[61:24.24]And he was like bleeding.
[61:25.19]He was like... Like screaming and like blood was coming out of his back and shit.
[61:29.13]And I was like, why did you do that?
[61:33.17]Does that count?
[61:33.93]Are these nightmares?
[61:34.63]Because sometimes they're like that.
[61:40.88]Yeah, that counts.
[61:43.43]In your opinion, it is sometimes okay to step on others to get ahead in life.
[61:46.63]Well, now they're dialing up the questions into fucked up territory.
[61:55.60]Is it sometimes okay to step on others to get ahead?
[62:00.23]No, it's not.
[62:03.33]Do it yourself.
[62:06.13]Do it yourself.
[62:08.63]Don't use people.
[62:13.60]I'm talking more of like a strict like in a... Don't use people.
[62:20.76]Don't like just step on somebody to get to the top.
[62:23.53]No, get to the top on your own.
[62:24.67]Get to the top because you belong at the top.
[62:28.01]Right?
[62:29.51]You know what I'm saying?
[62:31.29]Get to the top because like you belong at the top.
[62:33.77]You know what I mean?
[62:40.36]I'm kidding.
[62:40.94]I'm kidding.
[62:41.42]Jesus.
[62:43.35]You are dedicated and focused on your goals, only rarely getting sidetracked.
[62:47.37]I don't need to even talk about that one.
[62:50.47]If you make a mistake, you tend to start doubting yourself, your abilities, or your knowledge.
[62:55.37]No.
[62:56.79]I typically would take a mistake and turn it into something else that works.
[63:01.45]When at a social event, you rarely try to introduce yourself to new people and mostly talk to the ones you already know.
[63:08.99]That's kind of true.
[63:10.47]I think that's true for everybody, though.
[63:18.34]Most people don't just go walk up to strangers and do the fucking thing that I told you not to do.
[63:22.52]People don't really do that.
[63:25.52]If I would be introduced to somebody from somebody else, then that's a completely different story.
[63:33.15]But typically you just kind of hang out with the people that you were there with.
[63:38.77]Yeah, that's accurate.
[63:43.04]You usually lose interest in a discussion when it gets philosophical.
[63:49.26]Ah, that's like fun to do.
[63:52.89]That's fun to do sometimes.
[64:00.59]I'm all about like hypotheticals and stuff.
[64:02.67]It's fun.
[64:06.84]You would never let yourself cry in front of others.
[64:09.62]No, I've done it in front of you.
[64:11.80]I've literally cried on this stream like twice.
[64:22.10]You've seen me cry twice.
[64:26.57]For very different reasons, by the way.
[64:30.63]You feel more drawn to places with a bustling and busy atmosphere than quiet and intimate ones.
[64:35.25]Yeah.
[64:36.67]Las Vegas, come on.
[64:41.65]You like discussing different views and theories on what the world could look like in the future.
[64:46.03]Oh, yeah.
[64:47.91]You know, is a robot going to take over?
[64:51.16]We've had these conversations on the stream.
[64:53.66]What's gonna happen in 500 years?
[64:55.02]Are they gonna write books about this?
[64:56.52]Yeah, all the time.
[65:00.12]When it comes to making life-changing choices, you mostly listen to your heart rather than your head.
[65:05.36]Yeah, sometimes.
[65:10.06]Yeah.
[65:12.46]Yeah.
[65:18.84]You cannot imagine yourself dedicating your life to the study of something that you cannot see, touch, or experience.
[65:28.04]Probably.
[65:31.26]Probably, because I would get lost.
[65:32.32]I'd get lost.
[65:32.76]Yeah, I'd get lost.
[65:37.35]Comedy?
[65:37.51]Comedy?
[65:47.51]Oh, wait, I thought they were talking about, like... Oh, yeah, you're right, okay.
[65:51.14]But is comedy that?
[65:55.48]There's no study of comedy.
[66:00.02]Oh, what are you doing in college?
[66:01.66]Oh, I'm a comedyologist.
[66:04.54]No, you just... You don't, like, study dedicating your life to the study of something.
[66:20.45]You can experience comedy.
[66:23.59]Yeah, but experience is at the end.
[66:26.31]You cannot imagine yourself dedicating your life to the study of something that you cannot see, touch, or experience.
[66:36.25]I'm going to go with disagree because I guess comedy is a thing, I guess, right?
[66:45.74]There's no or here.
[66:51.41]It's not the study of or the experience of.
[66:54.19]It's just the study of.
[66:58.43]It's very clearly not meant as comedy.
[67:00.56]Yeah, it is.
[67:01.62]It's like what they're talking about here is they're talking about like religion.
[67:06.82]And that's mainly I'm assuming what they mean by this.
[67:16.98]Yeah.
[67:23.25]What about physics?
[67:24.13]Particle physics.
[67:24.81]Yeah, but the particles exist.
[67:27.32]Okay.
[67:28.22]You usually prefer to get your... I thought that said massage.
[67:30.88]You usually prefer to get a massage rather than... I'm like, wait, what?
[67:34.96]You usually prefer to get your revenge rather than to forgive.
[67:47.01]I've never had to get... I've never had revenge, though, before.
[67:57.13]revenge when have I ever had to get like revenge like maybe in like a video game world no I don't know you make decisions on a whim all the time the time you spend by yourself often ends up being more interesting and satisfying than the time you spend with other people it really depends but for the most part no
[68:26.69]Somewhere in here.
[68:29.91]You often put special effort into interpreting the real meaning or the message of a song or a movie.
[68:37.76]Hmm.
[68:40.44]That's tough.
[68:42.68]I don't really think I do that though.
[68:47.10]No, because every time I watch a movie that confuses me, I just find the subreddit that the movie is based on and read
[68:54.87]Da-da-da-da-da, ending explained.
[69:00.67]Da-da-da, what did da-da-da-da-da mean when da-da-da-da-da explained?
[69:05.13]And I just look at, somebody on Reddit has like two paragraphs that explains literally everything you ever want.
[69:10.56]You go, oh, yeah, okay, cool.
[69:14.54]So I don't like sit in a chair and have like a pipe in my mouth just sitting there like, hmm, what happened in that TV show?
[69:21.98]No, somebody else will tell me.
[69:24.29]No, I don't.
[69:27.29]He trusts Reddit.
[69:28.29]No I'm just saying like- it's- somebody else like already- somebody else already has- this is the thing about the internet and pretty much this is how it works somebody on the internet
[69:32.29]This is the thing about the internet and pretty much this is how it works: somebody on the internet figured it out already.
[69:40.30]If there's something that you think that like: hey wait hold on is that- what is that? What happened in that movie? I think- no no somebody already figured it out.
[69:47.30]There are people that figured out the end of like every TV show and every like movie and every book like years before they were even done.
[69:56.30]So, they already- they- somebody else has already figured it out. That's why I just don't even use the internet, if you're ever going to watch a movie just go on the internet.
[70:05.30]You always know exactly what you want - no I don't.
[70:09.82]You really think back on the choices you made.
[70:11.66]You rarely think back on the choices you made and wonder what you could have done differently.
[70:16.65]Rarely look back.
[70:18.75]So, like, I don't typically look back and see what I could have done.
[70:23.21]No, I do.
[70:23.87]I do.
[70:24.73]You always try to figure out, like, ah, it would... No.
[70:29.76]I can't pick the middle one because this website hates me.
[70:35.66]No, I don't that often.
[70:37.16]Maybe, like, once in a while.
[70:40.70]no no I don't I usually just kind of stick with whatever happens yeah I do when in a public place you usually stick to quieter and less crowded areas no I usually like the hustle and bustle you tend to focus on present realities rather than future possibilities no I'm always trying to think of like what cool thing could I try or do in the future
[71:13.26]You often have a hard time understanding other people's feelings.
[71:16.08]No.
[71:18.50]When starting to work on a project, you prefer to make as many decisions up front as possible.
[71:36.58]Something... It really depends on what the thing is, though.
[71:45.67]No, I do.
[71:47.57]When you know someone thinks highly of you, I mean like all of you, everyone here, you also wonder how long it will be until they become disappointed in you.
[72:01.31]We actually talked about this like two days ago.
[72:09.05]I don't give a shit about what people think about me.
[72:10.83]I give a shit what everybody thinks about me.
[72:12.48]I'm flippy floppy.
[72:16.98]No, but that's different though.
[72:18.68]That's different because if I thought when you know someone thinks highly of you, this is not flippy floppy because when this is a worded differently, when you know that somebody thinks highly of you, you also wonder how long it'd be maybe if they, yeah, no, that absolutely.
[72:33.94]Cause you want, you want to make sure that they still think you're like, cool.
[72:36.56]They still like you, that they still are having like a good time.
[72:39.10]Yeah.
[72:41.42]You feel comfortable just walking up to someone you find interesting and striking a conversation.
[72:44.84]No.
[72:46.92]I don't.
[72:49.14]Here's the thing about walking up to somebody and, like, starting a conversation.
[72:52.79]Everybody has this thing in their head of the conversation that they're gonna have.
[72:57.37]And it's usually the first, like, three sentences.
[73:01.45]Everybody blocks out the first, like, two or three sentences.
[73:04.29]And then after you have your pre-planned, like, two sentences that you're gonna say... Uh-oh.
[73:11.05]There's nothing else here.
[73:13.68]Um...
[73:15.64]So like for instance, right?
[73:16.60]Like, oh, hey, you notice that, oh, somebody likes garbanzo beans at the grocery store.
[73:21.42]I love garbanzo beans.
[73:22.72]Hey, I love garbanzo beans.
[73:24.20]Those are really delicious.
[73:25.46]I got an interesting recipe for like hummus that you could try.
[73:28.12]Okay, cool.
[73:29.06]Hey, that's the best brand.
[73:31.51]I usually buy that brand.
[73:32.35]It's a good one.
[73:33.27]I'm a big fan of garbanzo beans too.
[73:34.83]I got a recipe for hummus that my grandmother passed down to me.
[73:45.11]Okay, I gotta go.
[73:52.83]Bye.
[73:52.95]Everyone has the two sentences ready.
[73:56.83]Okay, let's go.
[73:57.97]No, I do not.
[74:05.84]You often drift away to daydreaming, but very, oh yeah.
[74:09.60]You look after yourself first and others come in second.
[74:25.67]There's a reason, yeah.
[74:28.53]Secure your own oxygen mask first before helping others.
[74:39.36]I read that somewhere.
[74:41.32]Probably on Reddit.
[74:49.83]Now, for me, listen, listen.
[74:52.78]For me to be able to look after somebody else, I need to be capable of doing that.
[74:58.94]I have to be kind of in the right mindset.
[75:00.70]I've got to be in a good spot.
[75:02.48]I've got to be okay with me before I can be okay telling somebody else what to do.
[75:07.05]You know what I mean?
[75:10.03]Take care of yourself first.
[75:12.07]Make sure you are good.
[75:16.63]Because how can you expect...
[75:20.11]to take care of somebody else if you're not kind of locked in on yourself.
[75:27.17]You know what I'm saying?
[75:27.75]Think about that.
[75:28.43]Put your own oxygen mask on first.
[75:29.78]Got that on Reddit.
[75:34.14]Even when you have planned a particular daily routine, you usually just end up doing what you feel like at any given moment.
[75:40.71]Yeah.
[75:47.07]Self-absorbed streamer steals oxygen masks and claims they belong to him.
[75:57.74]Have you ever been on a fucking airplane?
[75:59.60]Have you never been on an airplane before?
[76:01.80]That person never been on an airplane.
[76:04.24]Confirmed.
[76:10.21]Somebody gave 50 bucks.
[76:11.89]$50 from LaCranda.
[76:12.61]Thank you, LaCranda, for the $50.
[76:15.09]50.
[76:15.67]Selfish streamer steals bits from homeless viewer.
[76:19.69]Well, no, no.
[76:20.71]Thank you for the $50, but the homeless viewer walked up to me and gave me $50 and then ran away.
[76:26.96]And I was like, what the hell happened?
[76:32.64]I didn't say, hey, come over here and give me that money.
[76:36.95]No, no, no.
[76:37.37]I was just walking down fucking Twitch street.
[76:41.76]And somebody came up and was just like, Turbo!
[76:44.92]Hey, Turbo!
[76:45.86]And I'm like, huh?
[76:46.42]Hello?
[76:46.72]Yeah, what's going on?
[76:48.34]Hey, I had to catch up to you.
[76:52.91]I noticed that you like garbanzo beans.
[76:55.57]Yeah, I like garbanzo beans too.
[76:58.21]Hey, here's $50.
[76:58.61]I got a recipe my grandmother gave me like 10 years ago.
[77:03.89]You can make good hummus.
[77:11.80]I love the stream.
[77:18.03]Somebody escaped.
[77:19.09]Another person.
[77:20.29]Just like sprinting it up.
[77:23.35]Hey, here's $75.
[77:24.33]Whoa, Jesus.
[77:27.51]Hey.
[77:29.55]Here's 75.
[77:29.77]See you later.
[77:36.56]That was from Fly4Shy.
[77:40.18]Fly4Shy gave 75 fucking dollars after Lecron is 50 dollars.
[77:43.61]This is a lot of money, guys.
[77:46.87]Fly4Shy just says, thank you.
[77:50.55]I got the comb look, see?
[77:56.11]Always look out for yourself.
[77:57.78]Fuck everyone else.
[77:58.80]That's not what I said.
[78:01.66]I'm going to be misinterpreted.
[78:04.96]This white screen is killing my eyes.
[78:07.70]Hold on.
[78:08.12]I'm going to take care of that person.
[78:10.12]Hold on.
[78:10.42]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[78:11.28]That's true.
[78:12.32]Let me help this person out here.
[78:14.74]I agree.
[78:15.13]You're right.
[78:15.53]Hold on.
[78:30.16]Is it better?
[78:32.04]That's better, right?
[78:35.27]Is that better?
[78:35.99]Is that better?
[78:37.25]That's better.
[78:40.21]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[78:41.33]You know, you're right.
[78:42.77]See, I was sitting in the chair, and I'm looking at the screen right now, and I'm good.
[78:48.09]I'm locked in.
[78:48.63]I'm taken care of, and I can see that.
[78:50.33]It's not bothering me.
[78:51.49]So, therefore, let's go.
[78:53.57]What do you need?
[78:54.49]I can take care of you now.
[78:59.37]Okay.
[78:59.99]Are you in a dungeon?
[79:04.37]That would be a really unsecure dungeon door.
[79:07.80]I think I could run through that as if I went as hard as I could.
[79:13.32]I do.
[79:14.68]If I ran as hard as I could into that and used my shoulder and did it as hard as I possibly could fucking do it, I could crush through that door.
[79:23.10]I could destroy that fucking door.
[79:25.51]It would be like, it would explode.
[79:28.55]It would be like, boom!
[79:31.91]I'll give you $100 if you break the door.
[79:37.52]I'm not breaking, no, that's not gonna happen.
[79:41.46]Yeah, okay, I'll take a hundred dollars to have my Twitch channel like permanently banned.
[79:46.64]I'm not doing that.
[79:53.74]That's another, oh my God.
[79:59.23]So, alright, hold on.
[80:01.01]Jaredan, somebody just ran up to me, right?
[80:03.05]Listen to this.
[80:03.89]So a hundred bucks, Jaredan gave a hundred dollars.
[80:07.47]So they sprinted up to me.
[80:08.71]They gave me $100.
[80:09.15]Take it!
[80:10.27]I'm like, okay, fine.
[80:11.91]And then they said, thief, give it back, is what they said.
[80:19.50]Here's $100.
[80:19.74]That guy stole $100 from me.
[80:22.32]Get him!
[80:23.86]You planted that on me.
[80:25.38]What am I going to do?
[80:28.95]I'm going to let it go.
[80:30.82]At that point, I would just be like, I don't, my fingerprints are on it.
[80:34.22]Oh, I'm going to wear gloves everywhere I go now.
[80:36.44]Literally, I'm going to have like fucking like leather gloves.
[80:39.33]So if anyone ever does that, I can just be like, oh, it doesn't matter.
[80:41.33]I didn't touch it.
[80:44.11]Oblivion NPC.
[80:50.27]There's a fucking shitload of money.
[80:53.21]Thank you, Jeredon, for the hundred fucking dollars.
[80:55.68]And the money that I... I've got the gloves on, so it's alright.
[80:58.66]Then fly for ShyK 50.
[81:00.84]I'm never going to get through this personality test.
[81:02.90]It's been like an hour.
[81:06.62]Thank you.
[81:07.04]They say really thank you.
[81:08.40]Thank you for the hundred fucking dollars.
[81:11.06]That's what should happen here.
[81:14.70]Thank you.
[81:16.52]Your mood can change very quickly.
[81:17.80]You've seen it happen in the last hour.
[81:21.72]I went from the, okay, there's a VOD still, right?
[81:24.90]Yeah.
[81:26.32]Go back like an hour and a half when the first VOD was capped, right?
[81:30.72]And look at the mood I was in there and look at the mood I'm in now.
[81:34.42]That was in a second.
[81:35.94]It was in literally less than 30 minutes.
[81:38.76]Yeah, I can go all over the place.
[81:41.11]You often contemplate the reasons for human existence and the meaning of life.
[81:46.45]No, that's too much to think about.
[81:49.84]Once you start thinking about that shit, you start to... You go down, like, the path, and you're just like, wait a minute.
[81:57.50]What the fuck is this?
[81:59.07]Why can I see?
[82:01.09]You ever think about that shit?
[82:02.23]Why can I see?
[82:05.01]I have, like, my own VR 3D goggles on.
[82:07.99]Like, I can see.
[82:11.63]In color.
[82:13.41]No, that's fucked up.
[82:14.55]I don't even want to know.
[82:18.45]You have a brain.
[82:18.97]I know, but like, why can we do this?
[82:23.00]Why can you see?
[82:24.80]Why can you smell?
[82:25.66]Why do things smell?
[82:27.78]Why does anything have a scent?
[82:30.46]There are hundreds of thousands if not millions of different smells.
[82:34.33]Why do they smell like that?
[82:36.63]Why do things taste differently?
[82:38.79]Shit's fucked up.
[82:42.18]I'm not going to pretend like I know why.
[82:48.45]Sometimes.
[82:50.11]We're almost done.
[82:54.65]You have got detailed education or career development plans stretching several years into the future.
[83:00.43]No.
[83:04.75]You know what my career development plan is?
[83:07.63]Tomorrow.
[83:10.15]And today.
[83:13.57]And, like, September.
[83:24.02]So this is, hey, that's right.
[83:26.42]There's a stream tomorrow.
[83:28.44]Yeah, there's a stream tomorrow.
[83:31.14]As long as this, you know, VPN keeps keeping us at like pretty decent frame drops, we'll keep using it.
[83:39.74]You rarely dwell on your regrets.
[83:42.18]No, like I told you before, you grow.
[83:46.49]Spending time in a dynamic atmosphere with lots of people around quickly makes you feel drained and in need of a getaway.
[83:52.79]I like going out with people.
[83:56.64]You see yourself as more of a realist than a visionary.
[84:01.56]No, I fucking, I... It's like that, you know what I mean?
[84:05.92]If your brains are all in here, my brain's in here, but it occupies this.
[84:15.62]That's not saying I'm smart.
[84:16.94]That's saying that whatever like low IQ idiocy that's in here is not like densely packed into the brain.
[84:24.34]It's like up like as an aura around like all over here.
[84:28.42]I got pretty decent IQ though.
[84:29.68]You've already proved that.
[84:31.86]You find it easy to empathize with a person who has gone through something you never have.
[84:38.21]That's hard to do.
[84:42.67]But you like to try.
[84:48.11]You'd like to try.
[84:48.73]I wouldn't say I disagree that much on that.
[85:00.25]Because everybody has such different experiences.
[85:06.11]You know?
[85:06.92]If you have an experience and I have an experience and it's completely different, the common ground is something you have to reach.
[85:15.10]Kim's calling me out right now.
[85:20.86]Hey, hey, wait, wait, wait.
[85:22.30]Why is Kim personality doxing me right now?
[85:32.58]What do you mean I'm a realist?
[85:40.04]A realist?
[85:43.04]A realist?
[85:45.22]Okay, a realist would have probably...
[85:49.50]A realist probably would have gotten like a job eight years ago.
[85:58.89]I'm not a realtor.
[86:07.23]Kim called you a BB.
[86:14.69]That's not a, guys, that's not a personality thing.
[86:17.15]That's like a, like a cute terminology.
[86:20.19]That's not like a personality type.
[86:22.81]She calls you a BB.
[86:24.75]Oh yeah, I'm an, what are you, a realist, a visionary, or a BB?
[86:28.27]Which one of these things are you?
[86:31.29]No, I'm a fucking visionary.
[86:36.22]okay your personal work style is closer to spontaneous bursts of energy yes than to organize consistent efforts births of random energy that's why sometimes I don't stream I don't have a schedule right so like sometimes I it's like oh today I'm today I'm ready right let's go your emotions control you more than you control them
[87:09.48]Sometimes.
[87:13.28]Sometimes.
[87:14.72]No, we're good.
[87:15.88]We're good.
[87:16.62]Don't worry.
[87:17.00]We're good.
[87:20.63]I don't think this service is going to let this turn off.
[87:31.02]Look, I can live with that.
[87:33.30]I can live with like 985.
[87:35.62]I have 900.
[87:37.68]I have Jerma985 drop frames in an hour and 15 minutes.
[87:42.65]Look at it.
[87:42.91]I think you guys can see it.
[87:52.17]Then 985.
[87:53.01]Somebody's fucking with me here.
[87:59.33]Turn off the VPN and see what happens?
[88:01.23]No.
[88:01.53]I've already seen what happens.
[88:02.36]I was doing tests for like 45 minutes.
[88:06.04]It was way worse.
[88:07.60]Alright, let's go.
[88:08.70]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[88:09.34]After a long and exhausting week, a fun party is just what you need.
[88:12.12]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[88:15.94]I like going to fun events and fun parties, but no.
[88:18.91]It's not like, oh, I can't wait to go to like a big party.
[88:22.05]No.
[88:23.15]No.
[88:24.73]Sometimes it can be fun, but not... No.
[88:26.23]No.
[88:29.86]You frequently find yourself wondering how technological advancement could change everyday life all the time.
[88:34.04]Yeah, like not every day, but yeah, we just talked about it like 10 minutes ago.
[88:39.01]You always consider how your actions might affect other people before doing something.
[88:42.65]Yeah.
[88:44.89]Yeah.
[88:48.19]You still honor the commitments you have made even if you have a change of heart.
[88:53.17]yeah yes because I don't you you don't you look there's been a lot of times when like it's taken me a long time to do something but like I'm just so scatterbrained you know like I what do you mean no pikachu sucks who says that that's not gonna happen I have to the end of the year clown car I have to you guys I've got I've got plenty of time to get that situated
[89:24.67]Just wait.
[89:25.91]Let's have this conversation with me at the end of the year and tell me what happened.
[89:29.39]Fine.
[89:29.57]I'll drop it down in one.
[89:31.81]I'll drop it down in one.
[89:33.04]Okay?
[89:37.37]Doki Doki Literature Club, I said on stream 10 times, I'm never going to play that game.
[89:41.50]That's not a change of heart.
[89:42.84]That is a real, realist, non-visionary statement.
[89:47.38]I'm not ever going to play this game.
[89:50.20]That's not a flippy floppy.
[89:52.02]That's not a commitment.
[89:53.41]The commitment was to not do it.
[89:55.49]So I think I'm doing pretty well.
[89:56.75]Yeah, I think so.
[89:58.61]You rarely feel insecure.
[90:08.50]Oh, this is it!
[90:08.88]This is it!
[90:09.18]This is it!
[90:20.71]What am I?
[90:24.09]Your personality type is campaigner.
[90:27.07]E-N-F-P-A.
[90:31.33]Wait, let's go over this.
[90:35.65]Mind.
[90:36.91]This trait determines how we interact with our environment.
[90:40.70]72% extroverted.
[90:43.28]It's 28% introverted, okay.
[90:46.88]Energy.
[90:48.48]This trait shows where we direct our mental energy.
[90:53.45]69% intuitive and 31% observant.
[90:56.07]I mean, I'm pretty intuitive.
[90:57.87]Alright.
[91:00.99]Alright, that means I'm smart.
[91:05.58]nature this trait determines how we make decisions and cope with emotions 30 65 just feeling this is the psycho trait by the way what this is the psycho trait this trait reflects our approach to work planning and decision making prospecting 72 prospecting

[92:01.82]Hey, alright, introduction.
[92:03.78]I don't want to read all this.
[92:06.82]Hold on.
[92:08.12]Let's just get the TL;DR.
[92:09.82]The campaigner personality is a true free spirit.
[92:12.63]They're often the life of the party.
[92:17.11]But unlike types in the explorer role group, campaigners are less interested in the sheer excitement and pleasure of the moment than they are in the enjoying the social and emotional connections they make with others.
[92:29.94]Charming, independent, energetic, and compassionate.
[92:32.16]The 7% of the population that they comprise can certainly be felt in any crowd.
[92:37.46]I am in the top 7% of people.
[92:40.54]Right?
[92:43.44]This is astrology.
[92:44.55]Why are they Minecraft characters?
[92:49.53]You can change the world with just an idea.
[92:52.51]More than just sociable people pleasers, though.
[92:54.53]Campaigners, like all their diplomat cousins.
[92:57.21]I'm a diplomat?
[92:57.85]Should I run for office?
[93:00.51]Hold on, let's read the thing.
[93:02.27]Let's read like the part of the IGN article that like everyone just reads and then scrolls to the end.
[93:08.23]Let's see what the score is.
[93:09.57]Campaigners are fiercely independent and much more than stability and security, they crave creativity and freedom.
[93:19.11]Yeah.
[93:24.77]Don't lose that little spark of madness.
[93:26.59]Wait, what do you mean madness?
[93:33.94]That's not right.
[93:36.28]The campaigner personality type needs to be careful, however.
[93:39.81]If they rely too much on their intuition, assume or anticipate too much about a friend's motivations, they can misread the signals and frustrate plans that a more straightforward approach would have made simple.
[93:52.00]This kind of social stress is the bugbear that keeps harmony-focused diplomats awake at night.
[93:59.45]campaigners are very emotional and sensitive and when they step on someone's toes they both feel it what's a bugbear alright let's go to strengths and weaknesses campaigners you may know oh shit really oh wait wait wait wait
[94:30.89]That's Iron Man over here.
[94:33.39]Alright, so... Alright, that's really cool.
[94:38.49]This is like celebrities and people of interest.
[94:40.61]That's cool.
[94:46.90]RM.
[94:47.44]Who's that?

[98:54.37]It doesn't say guy behind Willy Wonka.
[98:57.07]It says Willy Wonka, not person standing behind Willy Wonka.

[100:17.83]I'll be right back when I'm going to do another one.
[100:20.09]I'm going to do an inkblot test after this.
[100:22.61]I'll be right back.
[100:24.19]Let me know how the internet is.

[104:53.83]Because this website is a little weird.
[104:56.19]So let me get it over here.
[105:00.96]I took that quiz and it couldn't be more wrong.
[105:03.98]Now let's go here.
[105:14.57]Because this one, I want to make sure you can see it.
[105:21.08]Cause the images are kind of small to go here and then get me back here because look, come on, look at me.
[105:39.01]Alright.
[105:39.29]So this is a, an inkblot test.
[105:49.39]Let me just get this up out of the way.
[105:50.97]It's, like, annoying me.
[105:53.66]That looks so much worse, but I don't care.
[105:56.66]Is it dark in here?
[106:01.39]Alright, so the inkblot test... It is a little dark in here.
[106:04.09]Hold on.
[106:19.76]It's too dark in here.
[106:22.98]That's better.
[106:23.40]Now you can see.
[106:25.89]Okay.
[106:27.59]So...
[106:31.00]Uh, the Inkblot test, also called the Rorschach test, is a method of psychological evaluation.
[106:36.12]Psychologists use this test in an attempt to examine the personality characteristics and emotional functioning of their patients.
[106:41.26]This test is often employed in diagnosing underlying thought disorders and differentiating psychotic from non-psychotic thinking in cases where the patient is reluctant to openly admit to psychotic thinking.
[106:51.48]What?
[106:53.94]Um, alright.
[106:54.94]I thought this was just like, what do you think this image is?
[106:56.38]Uh, $100 came in.
[107:01.56]From Haunted Moon.
[107:05.36]100 bucks.

[107:24.07]Rorschach test.
[107:26.44]Okay.

[107:33.44]Hold on, I gotta move this.
[107:34.16]Alright, I see... Okay, I'm not gonna look at the answers yet.
[107:54.62]I see...
[107:56.66]There's two animals going like, they're holding hands, it's like at the circus or something, and they're going like this.
[108:02.80]Like, they're like holding hands together and they're doing, it's like a big presentation.
[108:08.24]You know what I mean?
[108:09.98]Like this is the animal, like the bear or something.
[108:13.18]And it's like flying his arms out, or like they're presenting both.
[108:19.53]Yeah, that's what I see.
[108:20.49]Alright, so what, I see a face in the cards, I don't see, no.
[108:25.74]I see a face in the card.
[108:26.76]I see a scary face.
[108:30.25]Things look like they're whirling around in the card.
[108:33.41]Looks like we're looking down on people or something in the card.
[108:35.89]Or something.
[108:40.39]It looks like we're looking down on people or something.
[108:44.21]I see a mask.
[108:45.03]I see a flower.
[108:46.07]I see sexual imagery.
[108:50.69]Um.
[108:53.89]Or I can type in my own thing.
[108:58.12]I don't think I want to type in my own answer.
[109:01.46]Things look like they're whirling around.
[109:03.04]Like I said.
[109:04.82]There's two bears.
[109:07.44]Continue.
[109:11.37]Just let's look.
[109:11.87]Hold on.
[109:13.87]I'm not looking at the answers.
[109:16.41]That's two people doing the mime thing.
[109:21.54]You know when they go face to face and they both are like, I'm moving and you're moving at the same time.
[109:26.16]Like the mirror.
[109:27.84]They both have hands like this.
[109:29.92]Going... Right?
[109:36.00]Right here, look.
[109:38.45]Okay?
[109:40.61]That's what I see.
[109:42.37]It looks like a bunny rabbit.
[109:43.45]It looks like an elongated horse head.
[109:45.97]It looks like an x-ray.
[109:47.97]It looks like spilled ink.
[109:51.02]looks like two distorted eskimos playing patty cake it looks like a giant open mouth well I mean that's the closest one right why is it an eskimo that makes them what the are you talking about it looks like a tunnel into another dimension or maybe New Jersey is this a joke website like is this like a is this this is not real
[110:19.92]Or maybe New Jersey.
[110:23.53]Okay, I mean, it looks like, like I said, the two, the mirror.
[110:30.45]Alright, this looks like, like I see, it's like a, it's a face here, and like these are the legs, and it's like back, it's like a monster leaning forward.
[110:42.01]Those are the front legs, and the back legs could be back here hidden.
[110:50.12]That's what I see.
[110:51.58]No.
[110:52.04]Looks like the coast of Italy after an... It looks like a pair of one-legged cannibals fighting over a victim.
[111:04.65]I love pudding.
[111:06.89]Is an answer.
[111:25.52]That's the closest thing.
[111:32.37]This is a butterfly, a moth, I would say.
[111:39.05]It's a moth to me.
[111:44.74]Moth.
[111:47.51]You know when you go into science land, like an exhibit, and there's like the moth up on the wall thing, that stuff.
[111:54.18]Looks like the universe is exploding, coming at me.
[111:55.99]No, no, you idiot.
[111:56.89]It's a butterfly.
[111:57.53]It's been crushed by a boot heel.
[111:58.93]Ah, that's definitely an inkblot.
[112:32.48]Finish it?
[112:33.39]What's the finish?
[112:34.13]It's not even going to be real.
[112:57.24]That's like a skull or like a butterfly or a moth again.
[113:00.08]It's Satan eyes.
[113:01.92]Oh, I see a fluffy bunny rabbit.
[113:03.60]I see a big naughty shape.
[113:05.38]What?
[113:05.88]Okay.
[113:06.70]Looks like a guy that was hit by a train.
[113:08.47]It doesn't look like anything.
[113:09.65]Can we have some lunch?
[113:13.17]To me, it looks like a mask.
[113:19.43]It looks like he just threw ink on the paper and folded it.
[113:24.13]I'd say it looks like a mask, but I don't really need to write that.
[114:01.21]What did I get?
[114:06.69]What does it say?
[114:10.61]Let's zoom in.
[114:11.47]Sickness.
[114:11.79]70% sickness.
[114:12.97]You have difficulty concentrating on keeping on task.
[114:15.35]Probably because you're an idiot.
[114:16.99]I'm not going to read it.
[114:20.09]I'm not even going to read it.
[114:20.81]That was fun.
[114:29.01]That website was from 2006.
[114:30.41]Okay.
[114:48.19]Let's do a candy list!
[114:49.85]Wait, what?
[114:50.33]Why is it not working?
[114:54.94]You really fucked that entrance up, didn't you?
[115:07.73]Hello?
[115:10.91]What the hell?
[115:12.83]So what's the problem?
[115:16.01]Why is it not showing up?
[115:29.60]Oops.
[115:33.42]It was cropped just the black.
[115:39.34]Somehow.
[115:42.14]So this is a candy tier list.
[115:46.32]If there's a better one, please direct me.
[115:51.31]But this had the most that I could find.
[116:06.71]Alright, that looks pretty good.
[116:10.28]Unfortunately, there are no Charleston Chews on here.
[116:16.84]I'm already irritated.
[116:19.24]Hold on.
[116:20.60]Now you gotta brighten the screen mode.
[116:27.93]Charleston Chews suck.
[116:29.63]They do.
[116:30.05]They're terrible.
[116:30.53]They're absolutely fucking revolting.
[116:33.69]Unless...
[116:36.21]Wait, you put them in the freezer.
[116:38.55]Put a Charleston Chew in the freezer for a whole day and then eat it when it's out of the freezer.
[116:44.80]It goes from like an F to like an A. A frozen Charleston Chew is really, it's pretty great.
[116:55.36]That's cheating.
[116:56.14]No, it's not.
[116:56.48]It's the same candy.
[116:57.20]You're just like mutating it a little.
[116:59.78]Alright, let's do it.
[117:02.69]Reese's Pieces, they're pretty good, but let's put them in B for now.
[117:07.88]I'm going to brighten my cam up.
[117:10.50]I'll take care of that.
[117:19.05]Let me brighten up the room.
[117:23.25]Reese's Pieces sweet tarts are on the same level, I think.
[117:26.75]Maybe not.
[117:26.99]Maybe a little lower.
[117:29.87]You still have a comb in your hair.
[117:33.00]It's a comb stream.
[117:37.61]Let me brighten this up a little bit with my smart lights.
[117:42.24]What color do you think I should do?
[117:49.12]No, that kind of makes you look like I'm sicker, like I have a green face.
[117:53.37]Red?
[117:55.07]Blue?
[117:59.79]Whoa!
[118:02.57]I forgot, this is the streamer color, right?
[118:10.04]I like it.
[118:13.34]Good thing I have my, like, puppeteer outfit on.
[118:16.01]So I can, like, be backstage in the stagehand.
[118:18.25]Alright.
[118:22.73]Where's your monster fridge?
[118:28.72]Alright, let's go Starburst.
[118:32.40]I'm just doing preliminary.
[118:33.60]Reese's up here.
[118:36.08]Cadbury Cream Egg.
[118:40.13]Hold on.
[118:41.39]Swedish fish?
[118:42.39]No.
[118:42.61]I'm going to change this.
[118:44.27]This is going to be F. Lighten up the internet window.
[118:49.10]I thought it was too bright.
[118:56.22]I was being screamed at about how bright it was.
[119:02.48]People were like yelling in my face.
[119:10.30]Better?
[119:10.52]Are you gonna scream in my face?
[119:16.56]I don't want you to scream in my face.
[119:18.90]Okay, that's fine.
[119:19.55]Alright.
[119:20.65]So, 100 grand.
[119:22.43]Let me change this, by the way.
[119:23.27]I'm gonna change this to F. And then this to trash.
[119:30.86]Trash.
[119:31.00]Trash.
[119:37.71]F is trash.
[119:38.91]No, but trash is just like you wouldn't even have it.
[119:45.01]Pocky.
[119:45.85]I've only had it like once or twice.
[119:50.88]I really don't like Swedish fish.
[119:52.02]I don't... Jelly belly.
[119:56.48]These are... Okay, you eat two of these and then you fold the bag up and you... It takes you like three years to eat these.
[120:03.58]You'll eat like one bag in like two years.
[120:13.85]I think I've had the same Jelly Belly bag.
[120:17.99]I think I got some Jelly Bellies for Christmas like two or three years ago, and I think I still have it.
[120:27.05]Yeah, I'm not a fan.
[120:28.21]And plus, the toasted marshmallow is the only one that's good in there.
[120:31.43]And lemon, is there a lemon-lime one?
[120:32.75]That one's pretty good too.
[120:34.69]Am I a vegan?
[120:35.55]Admit that you're a vegan.
[120:39.53]How can you admit something that you're not?
[120:42.53]Tootsie Roll is F-tier as well.
[120:45.14]It just tastes like synthetic chocolate flavor.
[120:48.10]Yeah, I don't like it.
[120:49.12]Alright, hold on.
[120:54.37]Butterfinger.
[121:00.52]You don't eat Butterfinger.
[121:02.80]What do you mean so wrong?
[121:03.90]A Tootsie Roll, it just tastes and smells.
[121:07.38]Tootsie Rolls tastes like when, okay, we know when you have like the Nesquik powder, right?
[121:14.44]You got the Nesquik powder.
[121:15.82]When it's empty, just like smell inside of that.
[121:18.76]That's what a Reese, not a Reese, that's what a Tootsie Roll tastes like.
[121:24.21]A Tootsie Roll tastes the way that an empty Nesquik container smells.
[121:31.87]Let's go up here.
[121:32.55]And butterfingers are too hard to eat.
[121:35.23]When you bite into a butterfinger, it just like gets on your teeth.
[121:40.53]You have to sit there and go like, all day.
[121:48.41]They taste really good, but you have to go into every single crevice of all of your molars with like a pickaxe.
[121:56.38]Even if you brush your teeth, a butterfinger is still there.
[121:59.77]I have an electric toothbrush that goes at like 500 milliseconds of a minute, whatever.
[122:06.16]It's like, and it doesn't work.
[122:13.26]I've eaten a Butterfinger before and done my super toothbrush.
[122:17.25]And there's still like deposits of fucking Butterfinger gold in my teeth.
[122:28.31]They still taste good, but you can't.
[122:29.49]I don't like to eat them.
[122:33.53]All the sour shit goes down somewhere at the bottom for me.
[122:37.85]Sour Patch Kids.
[122:41.07]Airheads may even be made out of plastic.
[122:46.63]I don't know.
[122:47.15]What are they made out of?
[122:49.95]Once you, okay, there's like chocolate caramel and then this could be plastic.
[123:03.23]I like nerds, though.
[123:08.79]Kit Kats?
[123:11.05]We'll fix this.
[123:16.31]Jolly Ranchers are... Oh, they're okay.
[123:18.32]But I don't know.
[123:19.22]They fit in that weird category of you can't have more than one.
[123:28.10]And plus, you can always tell when somebody has a Jolly Rancher in their mouth because you can hear it.
[123:34.24]It's... How do I do this without putting something gross in my mouth?
[123:41.05]It's like... I can't... How do I do this?
[123:43.95]I was going to put a coin in my mouth, but I have not cleaned those coins.
[123:49.73]Actually, I got it.
[123:50.43]This is what it's like when somebody's eating a Jolly Rancher.
[124:03.10]What's up?
[124:09.74]I don't like it.
[124:15.88]Ooh, but I'm sorry.
[124:17.80]Bottom tier.
[124:19.90]Both Almond Joy and Wiz Mounds.
[124:27.87]Not very good.
[124:31.25]I just did not very good.
[124:32.71]I can't, I don't really...
[124:35.23]You guys always talk shit about boomers.
[124:37.19]This is the ultimate, I'm a boomer and here's the thing I like to eat.
[124:42.57]This is the boomer candy.
[124:48.15]It is.
[124:48.67]No, that is.
[124:49.13]It just is.
[124:50.50]You can like it, but my grandfather probably thinks this is great, but I don't really like it.
[124:59.08]Hmm.
[124:59.64]I can't place these yet.
[125:01.76]Snowcaps are kind of gross.
[125:07.84]When was the last time you even had a snow cap?
[125:12.56]I think the last time I had a snow cap, I think I was watching Toy Story 2 in the movie theater.
[125:19.92]That's the last time I ate one.
[125:25.29]Oh, what are these?
[125:27.69]Dairy milk?
[125:29.27]Spree.
[125:29.81]Fun dip.
[125:36.28]That's Pez.
[125:39.37]Why are there two Skittles?
[125:40.13]No, they're not.
[125:42.93]Nestle Crunch is pretty good.
[125:44.21]I'm not sure I would put it above, like, Reese's Pieces, though.
[125:51.13]Pez is shit?
[125:53.65]Yeah, tell... You tell me Pez is shit when, you know... Pez is like Campbell's soup.
[126:01.73]You could literally eat it forever.
[126:03.67]It doesn't ever go bad.
[126:05.40]Does it?
[126:05.66]Am I making that up?
[126:06.50]I made that up?
[126:07.90]I don't know.
[126:09.00]I might have just made that up.
[126:14.68]I don't like... I'm not a... It's alright.
[126:18.55]I'll tell you.
[126:19.81]The Snickers bar is not very good to me.
[126:24.07]But the mini Snickers.
[126:27.37]The mini little ones are up here.
[126:32.53]So I'm going to average that out.
[126:38.18]Cadbury eggs are down here.
[126:39.46]It's too heavy.
[126:40.88]Better than sweet tarts.
[126:43.04]It's the same thing.
[126:43.50]It's not the same thing.
[126:45.06]It's completely different.
[126:46.10]They both have different textures.
[126:48.06]They're just different.
[126:48.74]It's different because when you bite down on a Snickers, you bite through and there's the only one end of the chocolate you get.
[126:57.60]When you have a mini Snickers, you get all four corners of the chocolate.
[127:02.00]It encompasses, it surrounds the whole bar.
[127:05.73]It's better.
[127:09.91]It just is.
[127:11.15]You get four corners of the coated chocolate on a mini Snickers.
[127:14.93]Big Snickers bite through.
[127:16.89]One of those ends is like peanuts and gravy, whatever it is.
[127:20.98]It's not the same.
[127:23.78]Somebody just said negative IQ.
[127:26.80]Some of you guys understand what I'm saying here.
[127:28.40]You do.
[127:34.77]Mike and Ike's.
[127:35.53]That's D.
[127:44.20]These are disgusting.
[127:50.93]I don't like this.
[127:52.41]What it is, it's just Cinnamon 3.0.
[127:57.54]All the fireball is, is just like this weird, overly spiced latte cinnamon shit.
[128:04.79]I don't like it.
[128:05.95]Plus, people drink this stuff as alcohol, and it makes me sick.
[128:16.77]What are these?
[128:19.79]Gumballs?
[128:22.66]Oh, sprees!
[128:24.77]Sprees are the little chewy, I gotta get this right, right?
[128:27.66]Sprees are the little chewy discs that have that really sour, fruity kind of taste.
[128:37.22]I'm gonna make sure I get this right.
[128:38.06]Yes, okay, they go up here.
[128:41.78]They're the little chewy discs.
[128:44.68]They remind me of Mentos, the fruit ones, the fruit Mentos, but like a way better version of the fruit Mentos.
[128:52.97]Why are fruit Mentos not on here?
[129:00.45]It's strange.
[129:03.57]Candy corn just should never be eaten.
[129:06.81]It's a decoration.
[129:08.10]I wouldn't put a decoration in my mouth, so why would I put that in my mouth?
[129:14.28]I'm actually kind of upset that one of my favorite candies is... Where's Three Musketeers?
[129:22.53]Three Musketeers are one of my absolute favorite candies.
[129:25.24]It would be up here.
[129:25.76]This is bullshit.
[129:35.30]Can I pretend one of these is Three Musketeers?
[129:40.19]It's in the trash.
[129:41.03]No, it's not.
[129:44.35]Lemonheads, they're... I don't know, they're on the same tier as, like, Jolly Ranchers and Airheads.
[129:49.71]It's that same theory.
[129:52.39]There are two Pockys.
[129:56.93]Pixie Stix.
[129:57.87]Gross.
[129:59.81]Ugh.
[130:03.79]Hershey's Kisses.
[130:06.19]Huh.
[130:08.85]Hershey's Kisses are actually kind of good.
[130:19.74]But... But are they that good?
[130:21.76]No.
[130:23.52]These are Warheads, the sour cake.
[130:25.54]If you've never had Warhead before, I would put Warheads up at S tier, but you honestly only eat one of these once every few years and you go, oh, wow, that was crazy, but that sucked.
[130:39.77]I don't want to do that again.
[130:40.61]But you have this weird memory that you liked them.
[130:45.77]I have a memory right now of those being S tier, but they're not at all.
[130:50.65]They're just, they're horrible.
[130:52.62]Why is it that every time you see this at the store, you go, oh, warheads.
[130:55.80]Oh, cool, man.
[130:56.84]Warheads.
[130:57.60]And you buy them and you fucking hate them.
[130:59.76]Every time.
[131:03.18]So like in your mind, they're up here.
[131:04.60]But in reality, they're probably down here.
[131:05.86]And that's a Chad candy.
[131:14.24]It's because of nostalgia.
[131:17.48]Nostalgia.
[131:18.72]Nostalgia.
[131:19.70]Am I saying that word right?
[131:22.20]Nostalgia.
[131:23.72]Am I saying that correct?
[131:27.52]Why does it sound weird saying that now?
[131:30.18]Nostalgia.
[131:31.60]Nostalgia.
[131:32.98]That sounds odd now.
[131:34.36]I can't say it anymore.
[131:37.98]I don't like... I mean, Pocky is... I have only had it a few times, but it's just like, eh, it's okay.
[131:43.08]It's like I wouldn't choose it.
[131:45.02]It's better than Warheads, though.
[131:49.32]It's better than Butterfingers.
[131:50.90]It is.
[131:57.32]This is not final.
[131:59.22]Everyone's freaking out.
[131:59.86]This is not a final list.
[132:01.64]This is a general idea.
[132:04.08]And then we go from here.
[132:07.00]Dots.
[132:09.53]Okay, dots are the equivalent to me of finding gum under a seat.
[132:21.56]Sorry.
[132:25.23]they're always okay why is it that dots are always seem to be stale their dots are the stale bread of the candy world you put one in your mouth and it's like it took a little while to go through it almost feels like it gave you way too much give it's not soft not a fan
[132:49.43]I also am going to make people pissed off here.
[132:51.52]I really hate Twizzlers.
[132:52.78]I think that they don't taste like anything.
[132:56.62]It's just like... It doesn't... It's like that weird taste.
[133:02.04]It doesn't do anything for me.
[133:04.98]They taste like artificial... Let me try to describe this.
[133:12.87]I'll get it.
[133:13.23]Hold on.
[133:13.99]Let me use my visionary brain.
[133:16.61]Twizzlers are like...
[133:21.15]The only thing that's fun to do with a Twizzler, I got it, it's in my brain, I'm pulling it out.
[133:26.12]Somebody get like the fucking wand.
[133:28.96]When you bite off both ends of a Twizzler, and then you stick that into a drink, and you drink up the drink with the hole in the Twizzler.
[133:37.45]That's it.
[133:40.81]There's no other reason to eat them, in my opinion.
[133:46.62]they're just chewy gamey it's okay twizzlers are like the lamb of the king now that means it would be no no that's way off it's like chewy and gamey and I can't describe it you know what I mean they're not they're not good m m's nobody won nobody orders m m's I'm doing this based on like if I was at a candy store what would I get
[134:22.33]M&Ms are everywhere.
[134:23.15]There are too many M&Ms.
[134:27.51]M&Ms are the ant of the candy animal kingdom.
[134:33.79]They're just everywhere.
[134:35.37]Why am I doing these weird analogies here?
[134:39.45]There's so many M&Ms.
[134:42.47]There are more M&Ms than people on Earth.
[134:49.44]Yeah, I think that's true.
[134:55.76]Mm-mm.
[134:58.44]They're better than Swedish Fish.
[135:00.64]I feel the same way.
[135:01.56]Swedish Fish and Twizzlers are the same kind of flavor profile for me.
[135:07.45]And these also, Swedish Fish also, you open a bag, and sometimes they just taste, like, stale.
[135:14.01]It's hard to, like, you have to eat the whole bag in the first day.
[135:18.37]They taste stale.
[135:19.23]They're hard to bite through.
[135:21.65]I can't be the only person that thinks this.
[135:23.42]I can't be.
[135:26.80]Krispy M&Ms are S tier.
[135:28.34]Peanut butter M&Ms are way up here.
[135:32.10]But regular M&Ms are not, I don't think.
[135:38.82]I'm beyond wrong.
[135:43.74]Laffy Taffy, if this was salt water, can I pretend this is something else?
[135:48.18]Because I have to tell you my S tier candy.
[135:50.46]Can I pretend these are something else?
[135:54.57]No.
[135:55.41]Can I... How do I pretend... Let me just pretend these are something else.
[136:01.80]Saltwater taffy is the best candy ever.
[136:05.78]Nice, soft, delicious saltwater taffy is S. So, but can I pretend that's what that is?
[136:13.29]I don't want Laffy Taffy.
[136:14.39]That's like the fucking joke brand.
[136:20.81]add images I don't have an image of saltwater taffy on my it's not my desktop background I don't like uh whoppers either here's another one that you only eat at a movie theater
[136:52.62]And they have that kind of, they have that malty taste to them, don't they?
[136:58.92]What is that?
[137:03.14]I don't, is that that weird like coated sour straw stuff?
[137:12.35]Double bubble?
[137:13.19]It's going up here.
[137:18.09]I remember if you were like really good in class, a teacher of mine would give a double bubble.
[137:27.26]You got like an A on a test.
[137:30.18]There you go.
[137:31.48]There's a double bubble for you.
[137:34.56]All gum is one.
[137:38.15]It tastes good for one second.
[137:41.17]Better than bubble tape.
[137:42.11]Bubble tape is down here.
[137:47.15]Double bubble is better than bubble tape.
[137:52.69]Look, bubble, look at, look.
[137:57.52]Bubble tape, oh, I'm so old.
[137:59.50]Bubble tape is old too.
[138:09.13]That's boomer gum.
[138:11.37]Bubble tape is old.
[138:13.71]They ran an entire commercial campaign, guys, 20 years ago about how bubble tape was not supposed to be eaten by old people.
[138:20.74]They did a whole ad campaign where there was like the same like old librarian looking lady that would like be going like this into the camera and stuff.
[138:28.86]And it was like skateboards and it's for you, not them.
[138:33.19]Bubble tape, it's six feet of bubble gum for you, not them.
[138:38.09]That was the commercial.
[138:40.01]So that was 20 years ago.
[138:57.78]Just wait.
[138:58.24]Better than Pez.
[138:59.16]Let me get these up here.
[139:02.48]The rest of these are... I don't like those.
[139:06.98]Tootsie Pops are much better than Tootsie Rolls.
[139:11.36]Because there's a new thing there.
[139:12.93]There's a variable included here.
[139:25.33]Do I like Tootsie Pops better than Sweet Tarts?
[139:30.34]I'll figure that out later.
[139:35.05]Mr. Goodbar is interesting because I don't have any memories of eating this, but I've eaten it a bunch of times.
[139:41.34]This is the memory wipe candy.
[139:44.96]Because nobody knows or can remember what this tastes like.
[139:51.21]I know it's good.
[140:00.95]Is this one with the little crunchies in it?
[140:05.93]It's got the little crunchies in it, right?
[140:11.71]It's kind of like, um... Is it peanuts?
[140:15.13]It's peanuts.
[140:20.66]It's peanuts and something else, though.
[140:25.14]Can we pretend this is Three Musketeers?
[140:31.79]What are these?
[140:36.25]No, no.
[140:39.67]I'm thinking a crackle.
[140:40.77]Okay, yeah, you're right.
[140:42.25]I am thinking a crackle.
[140:50.29]Ooh, dum-dum.
[140:51.33]These are the little lollipops.
[140:52.61]I love these.
[140:53.86]These go up here.
[140:57.94]Dum Dums are fucking awesome.
[140:59.86]It's the perfect amount of lollipop.
[141:02.78]They're this big.
[141:03.84]They're like tiny.
[141:05.02]They're like this.
[141:05.92]They're minuscule.
[141:08.22]You just put it in your mouth.
[141:09.78]It just sits in there.
[141:12.18]That's the doctor's office lollipop.
[141:13.96]No, no, no, no.
[141:14.52]The doctor's office lollipops are flat.
[141:16.89]Those are the little round ones.
[141:19.09]Yeah.
[141:19.51]No, no.
[141:19.79]This place is... I love it.
[141:22.33]Yeah.
[141:22.75]Definitely up there.
[141:24.01]Little Dum Dums.
[141:26.50]Oh, you like dum-dums because you're a dum-dum!
[141:28.46]Let's save that.
[141:34.73]Lifesavers should be up here, but they're not because they hurt.
[141:38.99]Lifesavers do this thing where after one of them's in your mouth for more than like 10 minutes or so and it gets to be really thin, it starts to become a knife that like pierces you and stabs you.
[141:51.96]They don't dissolve fast enough.
[141:54.20]They just turn into weapons in your mouth.
[142:00.04]And then if it gets to that point where you... Oh, this is getting really kind of small now.
[142:03.36]I need to break it.
[142:05.00]It's like... It's like biting on glass and you have to be real careful.
[142:09.63]They're good, though.
[142:10.79]They have a good flavor.
[142:14.97]I would probably rather have a Lifesaver than a Skittle.
[142:23.86]What is this?
[142:26.51]Haribo... I don't like gummy bears.
[142:31.49]I wouldn't put these... I'd put gummy bears over... Okay, I'd rather have a gummy bear than a Hershey's Kiss.
[142:45.28]Was that like the explosion here?
[142:55.51]I don't eat gummy bears.
[142:57.51]A gummy bear.
[143:04.09]These two are the same thing.
[143:07.11]One of them you can chew through, the other one just clangs around in your mouth.
[143:11.21]These are the same flavor.
[143:12.37]What do I mean wrong?
[143:21.58]I'm not done.
[143:25.19]I'm trolling chocolate.
[143:26.03]I don't like gummy bears.
[143:30.05]I don't like gummy bears.
[143:32.32]I don't like to eat gummy bears.
[143:33.70]I don't like gummy bears.
[143:35.96]I'm not trolling everybody.
[143:37.42]I just don't like gummies.
[143:38.80]I like peanut butter and chocolate and bubble gum.
[143:41.34]I don't like gummy bears.
[143:45.77]Are we really going to do a fucking green eggs and ham segment with you guys here?
[143:49.75]Where you follow me around and try to get me to eat them and I tell you no?
[143:59.24]Plus, I've had gummy bears before.
[144:01.58]This is like the McDonald's, oh shit, I can't say that.
[144:04.11]I just probably made a lot of people.
[144:06.07]This is like the Coca-Cola of gummy bears.
[144:09.79]Right?
[144:11.29]If you go into a candy store and they have like a local kind of gummy bear, usually they're much better.
[144:19.44]Haribo, aren't they like the gummy, they're like the Coca-Cola kind of Pepsi of gummy bears.
[144:26.48]That's real, right?
[144:28.54]There are a lot of candy shops that make their own gummy bears or they pull them in from some candy store and they're way better.
[144:38.22]I've had gummy bears before that were like, oh, those are fucking really, really good.
[144:41.60]But not like that of the bag from the store.
[144:48.45]Should I pretend that these are not Haribo?
[144:51.19]Should I think that they are like other gummy bears?
[144:54.35]Because this is not like general gummy bears.
[144:56.53]This is just about Haribo.
[145:01.35]Oh God, I'm being invaded.
[145:05.49]Are you here to critique my choices again?
[145:07.73]Yes.
[145:07.81]Why don't you ever tell me when you're going to do these?
[145:14.47]These aren't my favorite.
[145:15.31]What's wrong with these?
[145:16.01]It's trash.
[145:20.01]This is trash.
[145:20.41]Wait, let me ask you this.
[145:21.82]Would you put Haribo gummy bears out of the bag, right?
[145:26.76]Like, out of the bag.
[145:30.89]What better or worse than like a local candy store gummy bear?
[145:34.71]Oh, we had a local candy store.
[145:36.07]That's what I'm saying.
[145:37.19]And how much better were they than like the bag of gummy bears?
[145:41.75]I like gummy bears though.
[145:47.40]Baby alert.
[145:48.16]That is a baby.
[145:49.58]He's a baby.
[145:50.44]Hello, Otto.
[145:51.76]He just had a treat.
[145:53.32]A treat?
[145:54.04]Yeah, he just had a treat.
[145:55.42]He was such a good boy.
[145:56.40]Are you a good boy?
[145:57.04]Yes.
[145:58.44]Hello, Mr. Good Boy.
[146:00.98]Alright, so I don't know.
[146:02.76]Have you ever had a... Do you like Whoppers?
[146:05.07]Whoppers?
[146:05.37]I like Whoppers, yeah.
[146:08.63]Yeah, me too.
[146:09.05]They're pretty good.
[146:10.43]I put them at like C. Up here.
[146:15.55]Probably better than... Why is this bubble tape there?
[146:18.40]It's just, it's like, it's not there.
[146:19.66]It's like a preliminary thing.
[146:22.06]Okay.
[146:23.10]Cream eggs, trash.
[146:24.60]Put that in F. No, no, no, no.
[146:26.18]I'm not doing... Look, I gotta...
[146:29.45]Under pressure.
[146:30.05]I can't.
[146:32.15]Alright.
[146:32.45]No.
[146:32.59]What are you doing?
[146:34.48]I just took the brush out of your hand.
[146:37.02]Oh.
[146:38.00]No.
[146:38.22]Don't brush my hair on stream.
[146:43.32]I need to be in my own zone here.
[146:45.78]I can't have somebody off my shoulder critiquing my choices.
[146:47.88]Okay.
[146:49.26]Imagine if somebody was just staring over your shoulder.
[146:51.25]No, no, no, no, no.
[146:51.97]What you did.
[146:52.71]Those Reese's don't belong there.
[146:54.49]You'd be like, what are you talking about?
[146:55.51]We have to do.
[146:56.85]They belong here.
[146:59.39]You're being like, you guys are critiquing me, but this is like a real person here in the room going, I can imagine there were like 4,000 fucking people standing behind me.
[147:09.68]I would be like, in real time, it'd be like, whoppers go down here.
[147:15.28]And somebody, you'd hear somebody like 400 feet behind being like, you're a fucking idiot.
[147:18.71]I'd be like, so I'm sorry.
[147:21.53]It's a C tier, I think.
[147:25.39]Kim is your conscience.
[147:29.61]Let Otto make the next decision.
[147:31.18]Otto, what do you think?
[147:31.92]I don't know.
[147:34.52]He loves everything.
[147:35.98]Has he eaten?
[147:36.42]Uh, yes.
[147:40.06]Otto!
[147:40.36]Otto, he's eaten.
[147:44.30]It's really dark in here, isn't it?
[147:46.68]He's a centrist candy man.
[147:48.98]No, look, I don't like the soury stuff.
[147:53.78]I don't.
[147:54.70]Oh, yeah.
[147:55.08]This is when I got really mad.
[147:57.64]What, these?
[147:58.16]No, no, no.
[147:59.08]When you put the sour ropes on the bottom.
[148:03.57]I didn't remember what they were.
[148:06.09]They're like.
[148:06.85]These?
[148:07.19]S tier.
[148:11.27]Alright, cut the mic.
[148:16.66]Just kidding, I'm just miming.
[148:17.72]Do you think Sour Patch goes at D, or do you think it... No, I think it goes up to... I think you put Jolly Rancher down at somewhere around...
[148:46.88]you doing?
[149:45.81]Never mind, it's not gonna work.
[149:48.01]I was thinking... I was thinking of trying to get, like, Otto to sit in the chair.
[149:52.16]Like, be sitting here.
[149:53.92]And, like, he picks one.
[149:55.30]Because he wanted to, but... Didn't work out that way.
[150:02.28]Like, oh, it's Otto!
[150:03.13]He's... I'm not gonna do that.
[150:11.77]More like get... What are you...
[150:12.81]What?! !
[150:20.59]I don't know, I... I got it, I got it, I got it.
[150:30.02]Maybe it would be funny, like, to have a scenario where, like, I just leave.
[150:40.15]Stop, stop, stop.
[150:42.17]Stop saying that.
[150:43.37]Stop that.
[150:44.17]This is a, this is a, this is a, a PG 13 slightly towards our stream.
[150:50.68]That's not, we don't do talk about that on here.
[150:54.10]What happened to my, she's like sitting there like brushing my hair.
[150:57.40]Well, like just imagine my scenario.
[150:59.06]You know what I mean?
[150:59.50]I'm just like doing a tier list about fucking candy.
[151:02.68]And like my girlfriend's brushing my hair and I'm just like, what's happening?
[151:12.12]I'm very easily distracted.
[151:17.27]Okay.
[151:18.75]Where were we?
[151:20.07]Oh, yeah.
[151:21.55]Sorry.
[151:28.03]Okay.
[151:28.73]I gotta get back on track here.
[151:32.80]Where's Ring Pops?
[151:33.74]Those are awesome.
[151:37.62]Where are they?
[151:39.88]Somebody said Ring Pops are trash.
[151:41.46]No, they're not.
[151:49.18]What's wrong with a Ring Pop?
[151:55.34]I think I would rather have a Ring Pop than like a Cadbury Egg.
[151:59.33]In fact, I don't know why they're up here this high.
[152:03.87]There's no right way to eat a Cadbury Egg.
[152:05.83]And I'm not talking about like the Reese's campaign where there's no wrong way to eat a Reese's.
[152:09.68]There's no way to eat a Cadbury Egg.
[152:12.90]If you bite into a Cadbury egg, it goes all over your mouth and all over your pants and shit.
[152:18.34]If you put the whole thing in your mouth at once, it chokes you because it's too much.
[152:22.24]There's no way to eat a Cadbury egg.
[152:24.06]That should be their campaign.
[152:30.32]Just swallow it whole.
[152:31.42]That would hurt so bad.
[152:38.54]Yeah, I would put them underneath here.
[152:40.90]Probably below Butterfinger, too.
[152:45.51]I don't think I've ever... I've never... I don't think I've had these.
[152:47.60]Aren't these the same things as Whoppers?
[152:51.94]Fun fact, Sour Patch Kids are S+.
[152:56.44]No, they start to... they start to hurt.
[153:00.00]They start... I determine if I like a candy or not based on how many I can eat in a row before it makes me sick.
[153:08.54]That sounds fucked up.
[153:09.97]It does, but... I mean, like, how many can I eat in a row...
[153:15.36]Before I like start to not, I hate them.
[153:18.03]And while a Sour Patch Kid or a Swedish Fish may taste very, very good, after eight of them, you start to feel like shit.
[153:28.91]I could eat like two or three bars of Twix.
[153:34.09]If I eat like eight to 10 Swedish fish, they start to turn and cement themselves into one giant Swedish fish ball that sits down here.
[153:44.14]Like down at the bottom of your esophagus.
[153:47.38]It turns into like a ball.
[153:51.82]Like bubble tape.
[153:52.50]I don't know why people like this so much, or even like, this is like a little bit different, but bubble tape.
[153:58.14]When you eat the whole roll, you feel like terrible afterwards.
[154:02.49]It's like that chewy candy and you're supposed to chew it and swallow it like a fruit by the foot.
[154:07.82]When you eat that whole thing, it sucks.
[154:09.30]You feel horrible.
[154:11.72]I think there was one time I ate a whole thing of bubble tape.
[154:14.85]I was watching a movie and I almost shit my pants.
[154:31.50]That's like eating a whole pack of gum.
[154:33.32]It is a whole, that's like five packs of gum.
[154:37.84]What was the movie?
[154:38.82]Toy Story 1.
[154:39.38]Alright.
[154:43.58]Everlasting Gobstopper.
[154:46.46]I'm not sure I've ever had these really, to be honest.
[154:51.61]No, I have.
[154:52.37]They're like in that same category of like this kind of shit.
[154:55.15]It's like a jawbreaker.
[154:58.37]This is just like a milk chocolate bar.
[155:01.57]But they're good.
[155:02.51]I've had them before.
[155:03.61]Better than the eggs.
[155:07.69]Oh, this is the YouTube Surprise Eggs.
[155:12.04]I'm putting them down here because I'm sick of seeing those in my recommended feed.
[155:16.14]So, no, I don't want to see them anymore.
[155:19.50]100 grand?
[155:20.48]It's like, they're alright.
[155:26.63]I don't really know what these are.
[155:28.11]Laffy?
[155:28.79]Taffy?
[155:31.32]Mmm, not as good as real taffy.
[155:35.56]Is it another one of those YouTube surprise eggs?
[155:37.16]I don't want it.
[155:41.50]Who thought it was a good... No, honest to God.
[155:44.67]Who thought it was a good idea to put little swallowable toys in food?
[155:53.21]Why would you do that?
[155:55.39]Is it like... Do you eat around it?
[155:57.51]Do you break it in half?
[155:58.61]Like, what...
[156:05.31]They aren't even in the food.
[156:06.57]They're not?
[156:07.07]I thought it was like you, isn't it like inside of the food there is the little toy?
[156:15.05]Only Americans are dumb enough to eat those.
[156:24.07]What about like kids?
[156:26.95]What about like little kids?
[156:28.70]How would they know?
[156:32.50]See like: do you- are you supposed to just break it in half, take the thing out and like eat the chocolate?
[156:38.50]I would just put it in my mouth and like that would be like the coolest surprise: is like put the whole thing in your mouth without opening it and then like let the chocolate melt around you while you move it around and try to figure out what it is before you take it out of your mouth.
[156:49.50]Isn't that how you do it? It's like: oh I wonder what this is let me see.
[156:56.50]Uh - it's a bike! Right? Then you take it out and see if it's a bike.
[157:05.01]They're inside of a container.
[157:07.29]It's in a plastic capsule.
[157:12.61]I've never had one.
[157:14.35]Moving on.
[157:14.75]I don't know what these are.
[157:20.18]Are these the chewy version of the Jolly Rancher?
[157:26.82]What are those?
[157:31.69]They're flavored Tootsie Rolls.
[157:33.53]Oh.
[157:36.33]They're the fruit Tootsie Rolls.
[157:37.79]I've had these before.
[157:39.41]I don't know where they stand.
[157:40.21]Are these now and laters?
[157:47.74]I would put now and laters up here if every time I ate them I was not in fear of ripping all of my teeth out of my jaw.
[157:59.02]I've had scary moments before when I've put a now and later in my mouth and gone down a little too hard and it's stuck here and I'm not going to get it off without actually hurting myself.
[158:13.29]Sometimes if you do those situations where you bite down a little too hard on now and later and you go, well, this is it.
[158:19.12]I'm stuck here forever now.
[158:19.92]This is my life.
[158:22.25]And you have to just sit there like, what do I do?
[158:25.29]And then you do, like a construction worker, you start to get leverage around a molar and sit there and hold and slow it.
[158:36.64]Too many bad memories.
[158:37.36]It tastes good, though.
[158:41.49]Please check hair.
[158:48.51]We're good.
[158:54.53]Ow.
[158:55.81]Fuck.
[158:58.03]I can't even comb it.
[159:06.21]Fleas.
[159:07.46]You want to check me for fleas?
[159:19.04]Is he balding?
[159:19.87]No.
[159:21.45]I don't know what these are.
[159:23.97]Oh, they're runts.
[159:25.99]Confirmed to me that those are runts?
[159:28.57]Those only exist in a globe at a mall.
[159:31.13]But they're fucking awesome.
[159:37.32]Those cost 50 cents.
[159:44.95]Banana runts are S tier.
[159:47.01]Yes, they are.
[159:48.73]Yes, they are.
[159:49.15]Thank you for reminding me.
[159:53.05]This, we already have one of these up here, so I'm gonna put, this is Three Musketeers.
[159:58.16]The rest of these, these are, I don't know, I don't know, I don't think I've ever had this before.
[160:02.24]Doesn't belong in the trash, but I never had it.
[160:05.14]An arrow?
[160:08.33]Arrow, have I ever had these before?
[160:11.67]Arrow.
[160:15.25]What are these?
[160:20.70]I don't think I'm... Wait, are these... Hold on.
[160:24.12]Are these the ones that are really soft and fluffy?
[160:30.62]You bite into them and they're very fluffy and very, like, puffy and chewy.
[160:38.60]This is good.
[160:39.14]These are really good.
[160:45.55]Oh, man.
[160:46.05]Am I remembering... Okay.
[160:47.25]And they look like a shoe, right?
[160:50.23]They're like, they're like weirdly shaped.
[160:51.83]They almost look like, um, like circus peanuts.
[160:54.09]Do they have the, okay, do they have the consistency of a circus peanut?
[161:04.79]Do they, do they do?
[161:06.51]Do they have the consistency of a circus peanut?
[161:09.38]And no, no, no, no.
[161:10.18]Guys, guys, guys, guys.
[161:10.98]Not a peanut that you get at the circus.
[161:13.96]The orange circus peanut candy.
[161:17.13]That exact, that texture.
[161:18.95]That like chewy but fluffy circus peanut soft texture.
[161:29.68]No, people are getting really confused.
[161:31.90]There is a candy that is as old as time.
[161:34.75]They were eating it in like the Bible.
[161:36.47]It's just called a circus peanut.
[161:37.99]They're bright orange, soft, chewy candy.
[161:47.01]We know.
[161:47.53]No, but some people were telling me that they don't know.
[161:49.75]Okay, so I'm wrong.
[161:53.16]So I've done that.
[161:53.72]Maybe I never had them before.
[161:55.34]I don't know where they go.
[161:56.60]There has to be another tier.
[162:01.79]These are bubble gums.
[162:15.26]Air bubble chocolate.
[162:16.82]I don't think I've ever had them, but I feel like I have.
[162:20.66]This is another country, right?
[162:24.32]Alright, settle down.
[162:26.35]I'm ready to make my final decisions here.
[162:28.55]This is Three Musketeers, by the way.
[162:29.89]It belongs up there.
[162:34.15]Reese's.
[162:37.13]Now, if this was a Reese's egg, it would go up here.
[162:44.93]It's not.
[162:49.43]Reese's eggs are the best.
[162:56.49]It's not a Reese's egg.
[162:57.23]I'm going to have to just go base Reese's.
[163:02.43]Spree definitely belongs up here as well.
[163:05.43]Furry Musketeer is up there.
[163:06.55]Double Bubble belongs maybe up here.
[163:09.33]Dum Dums are going to replace Double Bubble.
[163:13.31]Every moment I look at Double Bubble I'm remembering the dust that's around on it.
[163:22.73]When you take Double Bubble out it's covered in like this weird dust.
[163:31.64]Like this white powder is all over it.
[163:35.30]That's going to have to drop it a few points.
[163:38.34]I'd rather have a Twix.
[163:40.30]I'd rather have a Dum Dum than a Runt.
[163:46.20]I'd rather have a Twix than a Reese's PC.
[163:49.63]Starbursts have kind of fallen off for me recently.
[163:52.75]I'd rather... Kit Kat's probably up here in front.
[163:55.23]Everybody loves Kit Kats.
[163:57.83]Come on.
[163:58.01]They're like the best.
[163:59.15]In fact...
[164:01.31]I think that's fair.
[164:06.45]I'd rather have a Kit Kat than a Spree.
[164:07.91]I'd rather have a Spree than a Dum Dum rather than have a Dum Dum than a Run.
[164:12.76]Okay, Twix.
[164:14.52]Yeah.
[164:15.14]Nestle Crunch.
[164:16.04]You get sick of this after a little while, though.
[164:19.54]I could probably eat half of this bar and it would be a B tier.
[164:22.56]The other half of that bar is probably somewhere down here.
[164:26.62]Okay.
[164:29.04]I'd rather have Starburst than Nerds.
[164:33.92]That dust is fucking with me right now.
[164:45.64]Okay.
[164:49.36]Snickers, no, I don't, not a big fan.
[164:53.45]Sweet Tarts are really good.
[164:55.90]Mr. Goodbar is pretty good.
[164:57.24]Skittles are probably better than Sweet Tarts.
[165:01.32]No, they're not.
[165:02.04]What a lie.
[165:03.70]Pocky is here twice.
[165:09.84]I can't get rid of it, so just pretend that's up here.
[165:15.20]Fun Dip and Pez Ring Pops are way better than Fun Dip.
[165:21.93]Milky Way is better than Fun Dip and Pez.
[165:25.26]Jolly Rancher is above that.
[165:26.68]I just don't chew gum anymore.
[165:31.30]Not really.
[165:34.82]Sweet tarts are better than dust gum.
[165:41.40]Are they?
[165:51.46]Are they though?
[165:56.40]but okay when you unwrap a double bubble if you never had it before just close your eyes and imagine this and those of you that have had it before close your eyes and also imagine this because we're going to take this journey together that when you put it unwrap it's covered in like the gum cheeto dust you put it in your mouth and that first two bites is like the first two bites of a double bubble I think trumps everything down here
[166:31.55]Did you experience it with me?
[166:37.90]Yeah, like the first minute or two of double... It's like... What's that zebra gum?
[166:43.28]With all the food dye and coloring and flavors in it.
[166:46.28]That you chew it for five seconds.
[166:51.99]Stripes.
[166:52.45]Yeah, I would put stripes up here.
[166:54.63]Stripes would be above... It would be up here.
[166:56.33]Because that... There is a flavor.
[166:59.73]That stripes gum...
[167:01.67]has a flavor that has never been replicated before.
[167:07.79]It has this taste that you will never have again.
[167:12.35]It doesn't taste like something.
[167:14.29]It doesn't remind you of something.
[167:18.49]It just is what it is.
[167:20.34]And it can't be fucking replicated.
[167:25.14]Stripes Gone was awesome.
[167:30.82]Skittles kind of have that same weird textural flavor to them.
[167:37.50]Where's Slim Jim's?
[167:38.28]This is candy, man.
[167:40.70]Slim Jim's, that'd be on like on snacks.
[167:46.44]Okay, I'm getting sidetracked here.
[167:53.09]Those are gross.
[167:58.36]Ring Pop and Jolly Rancher are like the same thing for me.
[168:03.55]But I would rather have a Ring Pop than a Jolly Rancher.
[168:05.51]I'd rather have a Jolly Rancher than a Lifesaver.
[168:09.19]I'd probably rather have a Milky Way than a Good Bar.
[168:12.47]Or a Tootsie Pop.
[168:15.17]No, that's not true.
[168:15.95]Too default.
[168:18.09]I would rather have a Milky Way than a Snickers, though.
[168:32.51]No, I don't think so.
[168:35.53]I think I'd rather choose these than Pocky.
[168:46.19]Sweet Tarts belong up here.
[168:49.73]But does Pez... Would I rather have a Butterfinger or Pez?
[168:53.67]You got two people, both on opposite sides of the room.
[169:00.71]Hey dude, do you want some Pez?
[169:02.77]Yeah.
[169:03.29]Hey dude, you want some of my Butterfinger?
[169:10.28]Which one do I want?
[169:18.52]Pez.
[169:20.32]Because I would like to use a dispenser.
[169:21.58]No, it would be Pez.
[169:28.02]Alright, that's good for me, I think.
[169:30.89]I'd rather have this milk chocolate bar than a Pocky.
[169:35.31]That's not to say Pocky isn't good.
[169:36.39]Pocky is good.
[169:40.74]Yeah, then I could just, yeah.
[169:42.26]You get Pez for the toy.
[169:43.44]Then I could just run off with the toy.
[169:46.92]You know?
[169:47.22]Oh, hey, thanks for the Pez.
[169:48.10]And I'd like rip the fucking head off and then start sprinting.
[169:51.20]And then like give him, you know, that'd be easy.
[169:55.99]But Pez tastes bad.
[169:57.33]I actually don't mind the taste of Pez.
[170:02.35]Okay, a hair just fell out.
[170:11.99]No, I don't hate Pez.
[170:13.16]I think Pez tastes good.
[170:17.22]Pez is another one of those things that has that flavor that cannot be replicated.
[170:22.70]Alright, this is important.
[170:24.58]I would rather have these gummy bears than Sour Patch Kids.
[170:32.43]I would probably rather have a warhead.
[170:33.82]I would eat the gummy bears over a Butterfinger.
[170:46.14]Because it's really easy to be like, oh, I'll have a few gummy bears.
[170:51.49]You can't have a few Butterfingers.
[170:53.41]When you open it, that's it.
[170:54.29]And they're huge.
[170:55.33]Butterfingers are too big.
[170:57.09]I think I found the problem.
[170:59.79]I found the problem.
[171:01.43]Butterfingers are this big.
[171:04.68]It's like holding a hammer.
[171:06.98]If Butterfingers were smaller by default, you can get mini Butterfingers, but they're thick.
[171:13.76]Even the small mini Butterfingers are really thick.
[171:17.82]If they were a little thinner, do they make thin Butterfingers?
[171:21.92]That's not as much of like the shaved ice that makes up the internal organs.
[171:29.86]Why is he in a cave?
[171:31.29]Hold on.
[172:03.55]Okay, what was I saying?
[172:06.55]Crispy Butterfingers are great.
[172:11.50]Yeah, but are they thin?
[172:14.72]I would eat Butterfingers if they were thin.
[172:24.34]Add an echo to your voice.
[172:25.78]Oh my fucking god.
[172:32.70]Hold on a second, guys.
[172:33.60]I'm going to eat my Jolly Rancher.
[172:35.06]Alright, what am I doing?
[172:47.71]Oh, an echo.
[172:48.19]I don't think I can even do that.
[172:58.71]I don't think I can add an echo to this.
[173:09.30]Hold on.
[173:09.78]Can I?
[173:10.08]Wait, wait, wait.
[173:17.75]I think I can.
[173:18.19]Hold on.
[173:18.37]Let me add... Let me add an audio input.
[173:23.43]It's going to be the webcam.
[173:24.27]And I'm going to delay it by like a quarter of a second.
[173:36.86]Okay.
[173:36.96]Can you hear me?
[173:43.60]Can you guys hear me?
[173:45.40]Is it happening at the same time?
[173:50.87]Alright, here we go.
[173:57.13]So I'm going to delay this by like, hello.
[174:02.69]Hello.
[174:02.95]Hello.
[174:04.15]Hello.
[174:04.57]Hello.
[174:04.99]Hello.
[174:11.88]No?
[174:14.06]Hold on.
[174:16.10]This just became way more important.
[174:22.35]Hello!
[174:22.69]Hello!
[174:24.63]Hello!
[174:25.05]Hello!
[174:25.17]A little more?
[174:40.39]More, more.
[174:41.39]How's that?
[174:52.70]Hello?
[174:53.20]Hello?
[174:54.92]Louder, louder.
[175:02.32]Do it louder.
[175:03.02]Louder.
[175:09.58]Now I'm standing on a cliff.
[175:14.12]How, what's the, how long?
[175:15.26]Wait a minute, hold on a second.
[175:16.78]I'm gonna try to scare the shit out of myself.
[175:19.94]Hold on, let me see if this is possible.
[175:25.15]Does this do anything?
[175:28.27]Hey!
[175:33.31]Hey!
[175:43.91]Did it work?
[175:48.35]I'm going to try to jump scare myself.
[175:51.97]I'm going to monitor this.
[175:53.39]I'm going to try to jump scare myself.
[175:55.41]Hold on.
[176:08.74]Okay.
[176:08.98]This is going to come through.
[176:09.74]Alright.
[176:10.78]You ready?
[176:18.49]Okay, so what I want to do here is Reese's.
[176:28.15]Where do I want to put Reese's?
[176:35.55]How about put it up at S tier?
[176:54.46]Did it happen?
[176:56.52]I don't think it happened.
[176:58.96]Wait, hold on.
[176:59.40]Did it happen?
[177:04.90]I don't think it happened.
[177:08.19]What is 10,000 milliseconds?
[177:08.75]What is 10,000 milliseconds?
[177:26.49]Did it happen?
[177:33.03]Tell me if you hear it.
[177:33.65]Did it happen?
[177:37.99]It's quiet when it happens.
[177:39.42]Is it?
[177:39.82]Hold on.
[177:43.02]This just became something that is way more important.
[177:46.68]Alright, 50,000 milliseconds.
[177:49.72]I can't.
[177:50.10]I can only do, like, 10,000, I think.
[177:55.63]I can do... I can do 50... Okay.
[178:01.32]30,000 milliseconds.
[178:01.98]Nope.
[178:02.60]I can do 29,000?
[178:03.68]Nope.
[178:09.88]I can do 20,000 milliseconds.
[178:11.36]That's as much as I can do.
[178:12.84]Alright, here we go.
[178:14.14]That's the highest I can go is 20,000.
[178:17.71]I'm gonna scare the shit out of you guys.
[178:18.85]You ready?
[178:20.07]What if I mute here and then it just happens at some point?
[178:23.17]That'll work, right?
[178:36.76]Okay, so I'm thinking Haribo should probably go up a tier?
[178:43.38]What do you think?
[178:46.76]Something like five percentage points up?
[178:58.47]It didn't work?
[179:04.31]It should happen again.
[179:09.85]Wait, did it do it twice?
[179:10.97]It happened twice.
[179:19.88]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[179:55.08]Okay, so I think that if Nestle Crunch is somewhere over Twix, that would mean that Sweet Tarts would have to then theoretically be around there too because they're both delicious.
[180:11.53]They're both really good.
[180:13.09]They both taste very well.
[180:14.87]And I think that they would be in a good... Did it work?
[180:27.42]One more.
[180:40.47]Did it work?
[180:47.43]One more.
[180:48.25]I think my favorite movie was probably... I'm a big fan.
[180:53.09]Toy Story 3 was really good.
[180:54.51]Somebody asked in the chat.
[180:55.27]I just want to make sure that I answered it.
[181:00.74]Story Story 3... Story Story 4 was okay, too.
[181:05.34]I liked it.
[181:08.41]I think Dot should probably go... I don't know.
[181:10.47]What do you guys think?
[181:15.35]Not F. I don't think it belongs in F.
[181:49.34]I think my favorite movie was probably... I'm a big fan.
[181:54.18]Toy Story 3 was really good.
[181:55.58]Somebody asked in the chat.
[181:56.42]I just want to make sure that I answered it.
[181:57.86]Toy Story 3.
[182:04.25]Toy Story 4 was okay, too.
[182:05.85]I didn't...
[182:21.28]That sounds so fucked up.
[182:23.97]Like, what the hell is going on over here?
[182:35.17]What the fuck are we doing?
[182:36.57]Oh, yeah.
[182:42.95]I gotta turn this off.
[182:44.03]Okay, it's no longer being captured.
[182:52.64]Get a soundboard to do this again.
[182:54.52]Alright, hold on.
[182:58.66]I'm going to do one more, but this time I'm going to break this microphone.
[183:02.76]Because it sounds so strange.
[183:03.86]Hold on.
[183:04.17]Just give me a second.
[183:05.97]Last one.
[183:07.51]And then we'll move on.
[183:15.15]By the way, I don't know how loud this is going to be, so just prepare yourself.
[183:17.74]Prepare yourself.
[183:37.69]Prepare yourself.
[183:47.73]It's coming from here.
[184:00.29]Somebody help me!
[184:02.23]Help me!
[184:04.28]I can't see.
[184:05.20]I can't see.
[184:06.02]Where am I?
[184:07.26]Am I inside or am I outside?
[184:09.40]What the fuck is happening to me?
[184:11.20]No, the flavor of a Swedish fish tends to be a little overpowering for me.
[184:18.94]I like it when it's a little milder.
[184:24.71]It tastes good.
[184:28.83]But no, I don't think it's enough for...
[184:33.41]to have on a daily basis for your candy preferences.
[184:38.00]I love in the middle of this, somebody asked,
[185:01.34]Why did you do Pocky twice?
[185:04.49]I want to hear it.
[185:05.07]Let me see.
[185:05.53]Was that one any better?
[185:07.01]That's my mind.
[185:09.69]That's my mind.
[185:15.31]Somebody wrote, that's my mind talking.
[185:20.10]Record yourself from outside the room.
[185:23.66]No, I want to see that one, and then I'm moving on.
[185:35.21]Swedish fish.
[185:40.66]Somebody help me!
[185:43.42]Help me!
[185:44.68]I can't see!
[185:45.94]I can't see!
[185:46.56]Where am I?
[185:47.66]Am I inside or am I outside?
[185:49.80]What the fuck is happening to me?
[185:52.56]No, the flavor of the Swedish fish tends to be a little overpowering for me.
[186:07.91]Why does it sound like that?
[186:13.26]There's no reason for it to sound like that.
[186:19.22]Okay.
[186:23.16]I'm done with that.
[186:25.39]I'm going to continue now.
[186:28.69]I'm going to remove this from my OBS.
[186:31.91]And...
[186:33.72]We're going to continue with what we were fucking doing.
[186:41.21]Um, okay.
[186:42.75]Where I was over here.
[186:51.20]He's coming down.
[186:52.18]Oh, my God.
[186:57.69]I would rather have a lemon head than all this stuff.
[187:04.54]Probably not gummy bears, though.
[187:09.34]You promised us a Mambo No.
[187:11.77]5 lip sync.
[187:14.43]I'm a liar.
[187:15.45]I've lied to you.
[187:17.53]I'm not doing that shit.
[187:26.13]I'd rather have 100 grand than... What would you do with 100 grand?
[187:31.01]Oh, I would buy a bunch of stuff and I would put it into a 401k.
[187:36.96]What would you do with 100 grand?
[187:39.38]I'd eat it.
[187:39.86]Remember those?
[187:42.08]That gets fucking knocked down like five points.
[187:49.58]Don't -2 me.
[187:50.33]That's not my joke.
[187:51.15]That's their joke.
[188:00.96]As you wish.
[188:04.93]Alright, I'm done.
[188:11.43]I think that's pretty accurate for me.
[188:14.01]Remember, this is a Three Musketeers.
[188:16.59]That's not a Mr. Goodbar.
[188:22.03]What a terrible list.
[188:24.41]Reese's.
[188:25.76]Kit Kats.
[188:27.68]Sprees.
[188:29.64]Dum Dums.
[188:33.05]Is that really that bad of a list?
[188:38.40]Reese's, Kit Kat, Spree's, Dum Dums.
[188:40.20]Those are very, very, very high quality.
[188:45.49]How is Pocky trash?
[188:46.51]No, no, Pocky's not trash.
[188:47.95]There's two Pockys.
[188:49.79]I can't get rid of this one.
[188:52.04]Pocky's up here at sea.
[188:55.87]Why are M&M's an F?
[188:56.93]Because there are more ants... Whatever the fuck I said.
[189:00.45]There are more M&M's than ants in people on Earth.
[189:03.40]That's why I said it.
[189:08.68]Crispy M&M's would be up here.
[189:10.50]Peanut M&M's.
[189:11.16]Peanut butter M&M's would be up here.
[189:14.93]My favorite... Jerma985 chat memes.
[189:17.53]I'm going to do this one.
[189:18.17]Okay.
[189:22.93]Okay.
[189:24.93]Jerma985 chat memes take a screenshot here because we're changing alright let's go with here we go here we go do I even know all these
[189:57.39]I'm not sure I even know all these myself.
[190:00.13]Hold on, I gotta make this a little bit smaller so I can make it grow up here.
[190:10.20]Like this, put it down here.
[190:15.82]Okay, alright, so next is an instant disqualification.
[190:24.12]So is that, I'm not bald.
[190:28.62]I clearly have hair in my head.
[190:30.04]I'm getting real sick of that one.
[190:36.63]The slap has got to be up there.
[190:38.57]If you've never seen it before, take a look.
[190:43.77]Uh... Cox just... I don't even want to look at that anymore.
[190:51.10]That's not even a meme.
[190:52.30]That's just real life.
[190:57.06]Uh, okay.
[190:59.46]Vault coin, that's... I'd put that at a F. Wait, is this like what I think about the memes?
[191:08.93]Because I... Fuck the Vroomer, too.
[191:16.25]I like QRS.
[191:20.65]I'm going to add, actually, a row.
[191:34.04]Like, stop this nonsense.
[191:36.10]That belongs in the stop this nonsense category.
[191:41.70]People just fucking... That's not... That's a doctored image.
[191:44.21]I already know that that image is doctored, and it's this big on the screen.
[191:50.53]Uh, okay.
[191:57.84]Uh, I'm actually kind of a fan of the 8-meter.
[192:02.18]JermaCraft...
[192:07.88]Jerma's IQ, it's... You guys use that to make me look like I'm stupid, but, I mean, come on.
[192:15.65]Pre-recorded.
[192:17.69]+2, -2.
[192:18.91]+2, -2 is pretty fun, still.
[192:20.93]I think it's, like, still pretty fun.
[192:27.99]Uh, Peapants is up there.

[192:46.20]Ban that guy.
[192:48.96]Is that a meme or is that me... I just say ban that person from my chatroom.
[192:55.01]Like ban that person.
[192:56.57]Is me telling somebody... Is to ban somebody.

[194:14.10]Mustache hair is, you know, it's just true.

[196:54.70]Sometimes.
[196:55.14]Not all the time, though.
[196:56.44]Eating ass.
[196:57.06]Enough of that.

[197:46.03]Rats are just, you know, rats are classic.
[197:49.43]Up in smoke.
[197:50.05]That's kind of overstated, I think, a little bit.
[197:52.06]I wouldn't call it like a complete, complete total failure, but it's like it's on its way up.
[197:57.36]Pre-recorded.
[197:58.76]It's like on its way up.
[198:01.88]Kata's mic is currently fun right now because people say that, so that's pretty high.
[198:07.84]He's fucking naked.
[198:13.82]Look at me.
[198:14.82]It's still up there, I think, a little bit.
[198:17.96]He's laughing about it.
[198:18.92]I think that's down here a little bit.
[198:20.48]Worma is probably all the way down here.
[198:22.64]Didn't really do much with Worma.
[198:25.64]Jerma's a liar?
[198:26.54]Yeah.
[198:28.18]The Seagulls.
[198:29.50]Can't really ever get rid of the Seagulls.
[198:31.18]But I don't know.
[198:32.74]I mean, that's probably a couple of years ago.
[198:34.14]You know what I mean.
[198:36.15]Sub sounds.
[198:36.65]I don't even have these as sub sounds anymore.
[198:39.03]But when they were active, they were... I would put them right behind -2, +2.
[198:43.89]We're probably a little bit ahead of it.
[198:47.17]What?
[198:47.87]Rapper and Reddit.
[198:49.16]What does that mean?
[198:52.48]I'm not sure what that means.
[198:54.78]And then Cheez-It versus Cheez-Nibs.
[198:58.43]Up here is two.
[198:59.93]There you go.
[199:02.11]Dermot lied about the clown car.
[199:03.27]Just gave five.
[199:04.17]Thank you, Dermot lied about the clown car.
[199:05.55]Thanks for the five community subs.
[199:08.72]Five community subs.
[199:10.46]Rolling in.
[199:12.30]Thank you.
[199:14.12]Remember the House Flipper.
[199:16.50]Oh, right, right, right.
[199:18.22]Yeah, that's probably up here.
[199:22.92]Let me think here.
[199:25.43]No, fuck the Labo.
[199:26.25]The slap is way, way, like, funnier just because of how fucking embarrassing that is.
[199:31.30]Hot Air Balloon is up here, too.
[199:37.02]Photoshop's are better than Labo.
[199:39.32]Biaz, funnier than, uh, no, Pee Pants is, like, funnier.
[199:42.26]The YouTube voice is definitely below.
[199:44.47]I'm a top 1,000 streamer, so that goes above Labo.
[199:51.67]Jupiter is probably in front of this.
[199:53.49]Dark Souls 3 beating Dark Souls 3 is better than that.
[199:56.79]Constant Conflict is better than this.
[199:58.93]I lie, so that just goes down here.
[200:02.79]Hey, Peter.
[200:03.37]No.
[200:03.89]That's, like, not even funny.
[200:06.65]Dive to Pinwheel is, like, just a mean thing people did.
[200:18.54]Okay.
[200:20.46]I like this so far.
[200:23.11]Rats are better than this.
[200:25.23]I lifted weights on camera for like fucking 10 seconds.
[200:28.04]Who cares?
[200:28.44]Alright.
[200:37.70]Jerma Craft I think is better.
[200:38.62]Free Shit's better.
[200:40.26]jermaIQ's better.
[200:41.66]Band That Guy's better.
[200:42.64]Grill Master's not as good as the Chem Check.
[200:44.28]And Pre-Recorded is better than Grill Master.
[200:45.80]And Laughing About It is... Grill Master's probably better.
[200:51.38]Dermacon, that's nonsense.
[200:53.16]That's just a thing that I think would be fun.
[200:57.48]Okay.
[200:57.64]I think I got it.
[201:11.10]No, not yet.
[201:15.98]Done.
[201:19.35]Done.
[201:22.05]This tier list is bad.
[201:23.41]Is this a tier list of my own channel's memes?
[201:27.71]It is.
[201:27.93]Well, I didn't make these up.
[201:31.73]I mean, some of them I did.
[201:34.93]Why is Peter on C and Baldcoin on F?
[201:38.48]Well, it's just been a while.
[201:43.46]Who made the best controllers?
[201:48.64]Controllers.
[201:50.48]I could do that one.
[201:56.71]Yeah, give me the video game controllers.
[201:58.39]That'll do it.
[202:01.48]But I drank too much coffee.
[202:02.48]I gotta pee again.
[202:03.74]Tell me if the internet's fine.
[202:04.56]I'll be right back.
[202:05.62]I gotta pee.
[202:06.00]This is like the third time in... I've been peeing too much.
[202:09.85]I'm gonna ask my doctor how many times a human's supposed to pee a day.
[202:13.49]I've had my kidneys checked and my bladder checked.
[202:15.27]What's wrong with me?
[202:15.85]I'll be right back.
[204:21.41]Dude, it is dark in here.
[204:24.41]It really is a cave in here.
[204:28.73]Let me turn, like, the... I was gonna say the volume up.
[204:42.64]Watch the slap.
[204:46.17]I don't need to watch the slap.
[204:50.64]You know how many times I've watched the slap?
[204:54.16]Dozens and dozens and dozens of times.
[204:55.78]Alright.
[205:03.23]Let's come back.
[205:03.75]I'm going to change the camera settings.
[205:18.14]Okie dokie.
[205:18.96]Look at that.
[205:27.27]Better.
[205:35.48]More controlled.
[205:37.08]Do I still have the comb in my hair or no?
[205:38.32]Alright.
[205:43.82]Let's get this off.
[205:49.98]These are controllers.
[205:53.44]So D... I would just put...
[205:56.98]do a beer tier list I don't drink that much beer to have like a real opinion on it hold on come on get over there stop it alright that's good uh so these these are video game controllers
[206:25.60]This is dirty.
[206:26.68]Whatever.
[206:26.96]Okay, video game controllers.
[206:30.52]Let's change this to... Let's put F down here.
[206:37.24]New.
[206:37.94]F. Change the color, too.
[206:47.69]Okay.
[206:49.87]Fuck that thing.
[206:51.39]Seriously, that, like...
[206:53.84]That was horrible.
[206:55.28]This thing was so bad.
[206:56.99]It was so bad.
[207:00.75]Sideways switch?
[207:02.11]No, you can't even hold it.
[207:04.91]Although... What the hell?
[207:13.48]What is this chainsaw?
[207:19.36]That's a collector's edition perk for buying a collector's edition.
[207:24.56]That's not a... What is that?
[207:27.52]No.
[207:42.05]This hurts if you hold it too long.
[207:46.79]Super Nintendo controller?
[207:47.81]It's pretty close to being perfect.
[207:49.25]So is the N64 controller.
[207:52.19]GameCube is up there too.
[208:02.52]I'll make a final decision in a minute.
[208:05.20]The default regular Super Nintendo controller is at least a B. This thing wasn't very good either.
[208:19.10]This was this, but... In the way.
[208:21.92]The wheel.
[208:29.06]Really?
[208:30.08]The Wii wheel is here?
[208:33.50]That's... Why?
[208:35.64]Why are there SpongeBob controllers?
[208:40.72]I wouldn't use these.
[208:42.52]I mean, I'm not gonna buy that.
[208:44.10]I wouldn't use it.
[208:49.17]There's no... I wouldn't buy it.
[208:55.97]Can I just have another category that's just like, this is just clearly joke, like nonsense category?
[209:02.88]They're not bad, but they're just like, why?
[209:04.96]I don't want them.
[209:06.20]Yeah, there's a new category below.
[209:16.37]This is just going to be just like the nonsense category.
[209:21.09]I mean, these are not bad controllers, they're just nonsense.
[209:27.48]This is just a controller skin.
[209:35.84]What is that?
[209:36.38]Is that an N64?
[209:36.86]Is that a left-handed N64 controller?
[209:49.36]Well, I don't understand.
[209:50.12]Is that, like, for... I don't... I've never used it.
[209:57.70]It looks a little crowded.
[210:04.39]I would accidentally press, like, up on the D-pad when I pressed A or B. I'm not sure I like that.
[210:13.09]I've never used it, but it doesn't look fun to me.
[210:18.20]The Dreamcast controller actually is pretty good.
[210:20.80]It's pretty well made.
[210:22.69]It had the big slots, the big divots in the back to really hold onto that you can just slide into.
[210:34.07]This is a comedy controller.
[210:36.53]This is also a comedy controller.
[210:39.61]This is the Dance Dance Revolution pad before Dance Dance Revolution.
[210:44.01]So it's going to get F just because it was pretty new for its time.
[210:53.35]The Wiimote and Nunchuck, I would put them up here.
[210:57.97]They were kind of fun and nice to use.
[211:03.71]This is like a fishing pole.
[211:12.76]What is that?
[211:22.18]What is this for?
[211:25.44]This Wu-Tang?
[211:29.80]Wait, was there a Wu-Tang console?
[211:40.15]Was there?
[211:47.00]It's a collector's edition.
[211:47.96]Yeah, but that's what I mean.
[211:48.58]It's not like a controller that comes with a console.
[211:52.74]The Wii Fit scale.
[211:56.38]I'll put it up here where it belongs.
[211:58.44]It's right next to this.
[211:59.12]This is fun.
[212:05.32]The Steam controller is really not good.
[212:10.16]This is the same as this.
[212:12.15]Just with different colored buttons.
[212:15.92]So, I mean, I'm gonna put that in nonsense.
[212:18.63]This is just like the Skittles version.
[212:34.18]That's not, this is just like a peripheral.
[212:36.38]It's not even a controller.
[212:37.80]Is this a keyboard?
[212:40.94]Like, hold on, just a keyboard and mouse for PC gaming.
[212:46.75]That's not fair, is it?
[212:56.88]Hold on.
[213:09.18]What is this?
[213:18.23]Is it a mat?
[213:19.77]It looks like a beach towel.
[213:23.73]Is this another one of these Dance Dance Revolution maps or something?
[213:34.36]Okay, well that... No, the Wiimote sideways was better than the Switch sideways for me.
[213:44.26]Bigger.
[213:48.55]Here's the Dreamcast keyboard, which... This is just a nonsense Collector's Edition controller.
[213:56.51]I actually don't really like the DS's analog.
[214:01.63]It was too thin for me.
[214:03.13]It felt like it could easily be worn down.
[214:09.85]Oh, this is a fishing pole.
[214:11.14]Okay, I can go over that fishing pole.
[214:19.75]What even is the best controller?
[214:23.25]This is the Pro Controller, right?
[214:24.33]This thing's actually pretty good.
[214:25.63]It's better than this one.
[214:30.41]It's probably the GameCube.
[214:31.39]No, it's not.
[214:35.60]Which one of these was better?
[214:39.12]This one's better.
[214:40.94]Yeah, I wasn't actually a big fan of this one.
[214:43.60]This one actually feels better in your hands.
[214:46.42]But this one actually bumps.
[214:50.20]If you're trying to, you might bump it.
[214:53.76]I remember, you know, it's pretty good.
[214:55.00]This is just a joke.
[215:00.96]This is just a skin, so, right?
[215:07.39]This, this looks like a piano.
[215:10.85]Is this a keyboard or is this a controller?
[215:12.55]I don't know what this is for.
[215:22.29]What is this?
[215:24.09]Is this a gear shift on a car?
[215:31.54]No, this is, no, it's not.
[215:32.74]Alright, this is like revolutionary.
[215:33.92]So that goes up here.
[215:39.52]Those are Atari paddles.
[215:42.04]This is just a skin.
[215:44.02]Alright, now we're getting to kind of current gen.
[215:48.56]I really, really, really like the new DualShock controller.
[215:54.10]Way more than I like the original.
[215:57.02]I like how spread out it is.
[216:01.05]I think this is actually way up here.
[216:04.65]Original Xbox was a little too fat and chunky for me, but it was definitely better than this.
[216:12.27]I actually don't hate the Xbox One controller, but I do hate its annoyingly loud bumpers.
[216:25.86]The 360 controller might be up here.
[216:36.80]I think so.
[216:38.34]What else we got?
[216:40.02]These are not very good.
[216:43.26]The old SEGA Genesis and SEGA, they're very clunky.
[216:47.46]Three buttons, it was just... I don't really like the PlayStation 1 controller either.
[216:55.91]but it's definitely better than the Dreamcast keyboard.
[217:06.98]In fact, the DS controller is way better than the Dreamcast keyboard.
[217:14.44]This is not, yeah, I mean, this thing is like, what is this?
[217:17.30]What the fuck even is this?
[217:30.70]It's a boomerang controller.
[217:34.02]I don't... What is that?
[217:36.66]That's the SEGA Master System.
[217:40.34]It really wasn't that good of a controller, though.
[217:42.70]Better than this.
[217:44.64]It was really weird.
[217:45.73]The whole thing was one button.
[217:49.49]That's a stovetop.
[217:53.89]Yeah, you take this thing camping.
[217:56.17]That's a stove top.
[217:57.37]That's pretty good.
[217:59.01]That's really good.
[218:00.89]Mod that guy.
[218:05.41]This is just a joke.
[218:07.11]This is a joke.
[218:11.28]This is a cassette tape.
[218:13.58]It's not even a controller.
[218:16.26]PlayStation camera?
[218:19.46]I'll put them up here.
[218:22.54]We'll deal with them later.
[218:27.89]This is the deal or no deal pad.
[218:30.35]I don't know what this is for.
[218:31.59]This is a yes or no button.
[218:34.92]I don't think I would use that.
[218:41.22]This is the peripheral.
[218:43.68]This goes up here.
[218:44.68]This is just the evolved version of this controller Pokémon.
[218:53.10]Let's just put this up here.
[218:56.74]I didn't really like this one, though.
[219:05.08]Fight sticks.
[219:05.72]I don't really like fight sticks.
[219:11.83]And then... This is... Those are too many buttons.
[219:20.23]I don't know what you would do with that.
[219:23.74]Alright, so hold on.
[219:25.51]The Guitar Hero, it's a peripheral.
[219:27.53]It's not even a controller.
[219:30.47]Alright, I gotta make a decision here.
[219:32.12]What belongs where?
[219:33.72]What belongs up and what belongs down?
[219:35.80]I know, don't look at my zip.
[220:22.12]It's done.
[220:27.14]That's the most comfortable controller.
[220:28.28]I think it is.
[220:31.00]It has a nice weight to it.
[220:33.23]The analogs feel very durable.
[220:36.31]The button placements, the triggers are in a really good place.
[220:42.27]I think it is the best controller.
[220:46.73]It's got really nice triggers.
[220:48.17]It's got the L1 and R1.
[220:55.94]I like it a lot.
[221:01.30]The GameCube's really close.
[221:02.86]If this is S, this is like S-, but A+.
[221:17.05]I don't have to move anything.
[221:18.03]I'm happy with this.
[221:22.89]Where's the Xbox One controller?
[221:24.23]That doesn't belong all the way down there.
[221:36.42]This does, though.
[221:38.20]This is the Wii U Pro controller, right?
[221:42.45]They put the right analog stick in a really fucking weird place.
[221:47.71]Up above on the top right shoulder, it feels odd.
[221:52.47]Oh, this is the Kinect?
[222:04.01]This is not the PlayStation Move?
[222:13.84]This is the PlayStation Move, okay.
[222:21.13]What about Just Dance?
[222:24.59]I don't... I don't play Just Dance.
[222:32.65]Okay, hold on.
[222:41.13]This is better than this.
[222:45.87]I don't even remember which one of these I liked more.
[222:47.62]Probably the...
[222:50.35]Do I like Charizard more than I like Charmeleon?
[223:01.72]Yeah, I think so.
[223:07.44]PlayStation 1, I don't like better than the PlayStation 3, though.
[223:11.04]Xbox One is... Xbox One's definitely better than the PlayStation 1, just because of the introduction of analogs.
[223:24.62]I don't like the fruit slice.
[223:28.56]This is superior to me.
[223:34.89]Are these the same thing?
[223:36.27]One of them's just wireless.
[223:41.65]Wait, is this just the wireless version of this?
[223:44.03]It is, isn't it?
[223:46.16]Does DualShock 2, DualShock 3...
[223:53.39]These are like the same.
[223:54.25]Wait, which one of these is which?
[223:57.52]It's PS3 and PS2.
[224:00.02]Right, okay.
[224:01.60]They look the same.
[224:08.71]Okay.
[224:10.45]DualShock 2 has the wire.
[224:11.96]Okay, yeah.
[224:13.12]It belongs there.
[224:25.04]I'm alright with this.
[224:27.78]The rest of this shit is just jokey, weird stuff that I've never used.
[224:31.28]So, hold on.
[224:33.32]Let me go back up here.
[224:37.15]I really like that it's very minimal.
[224:40.67]The Dreamcast controller is super minimal.
[224:43.77]Gets the job done.
[224:45.92]It's got nice triggers.
[224:47.50]It fits in your hand well.
[224:48.96]It's got that cool screen.
[224:50.50]You guys didn't get to see that when we did all the Dreamcast stuff.
[224:53.48]There's a little screen that is your memory card that had all the cool random little... It would play little animations.
[225:00.68]You could use it.
[225:01.40]You could select things.
[225:02.06]It could have in-game features.
[225:03.24]It was pretty cool.
[225:04.16]The VMU.
[225:09.28]Doesn't have a right analog.
[225:10.08]Didn't need it, though.
[225:11.06]This is back when two analogs weren't really necessary.
[225:17.11]What do I mean that's not minimal?
[225:19.29]It's an analog, four face buttons and a D-pad.
[225:24.68]There's no other analog, and it's spread out.
[225:29.04]It has the same amount of buttons as a Super Nintendo controller.
[225:33.65]The screen is just like an added feature that's in the controller, but the actual physical controller itself is very basic.
[225:43.41]Oh, well, fuck, I forgot the original Xbox belongs way down here.
[225:46.59]I forgot, I just had a memory.
[225:48.83]The weird sideways tilted face buttons.
[225:51.37]Yeah, no, get out of here.
[225:52.95]This thing sucked.
[225:55.29]I completely forgot about that.
[225:57.75]The, like, it was printed on incorrectly type of scenario.
[226:02.29]No, yeah, that's below the Wii U. I hated that.
[226:09.59]Those got printed incorrectly from like the machine and they had like 50,000 of them already made.
[226:15.45]And the foreman at the factory was just like, just do it.
[226:20.46]Like this, just do it.
[226:22.22]It's a feature.
[226:25.28]No, I hated those.
[226:27.58]I don't think it's worse than the keyboard, like the Dreamcast keyboard or the grill or the Kinect.
[226:33.54]No, the Kinect is cooler.
[226:35.71]This is... No.
[226:36.67]Get that out of here.
[226:39.45]I can't sit still.
[226:44.39]Alright.
[226:45.03]The Steam Controller is better than the camping grill.
[226:48.40]Okay?
[226:48.90]It is.
[226:49.76]I'll give that to you.
[226:52.28]This is not a Dreamcast keyboard.
[226:53.80]What the hell is this then?
[226:56.38]Is this a GameCube keyboard?
[227:03.85]Have you even touched a Steam controller?
[227:41.98]Where the fuck is it?
[227:47.20]Yeah, I own one.
[227:55.20]I own one, but I don't know where it is.
[227:56.30]Never mind.
[228:02.01]I thought I had one in the closet back there.
[228:06.13]Here's how you can tell that I'm online about this, because I'm going to give you an elaborate story.
[228:09.21]And it's the only reason why you'd hear this.
[228:11.20]I'm not just making it up on the fly.
[228:12.26]I didn't have time to make this up.
[228:13.92]I bought a Steam controller because I currently, like maybe this is probably like three and a half years ago.
[228:18.69]I got back into World of Warcraft.
[228:21.65]during the Legion, whatever it was.
[228:25.32]What was it called?
[228:26.00]Yeah, the expansion pack that people liked like two or three years ago.
[228:30.08]So I wanted to not use my keyboard and mouse to play World of Warcraft.
[228:34.18]I desperately wanted to lean back and lie on a couch and just play World of Warcraft from the computer.
[228:38.88]So I was like, hold on a minute, wait, I can do the Steam controller because I can map it
[228:43.39]Everything can be mapped to this to it being like a PC keyboard, right?
[228:47.75]So I tried to do it and I realized that trying to use the Steam controller to play World of Warcraft was impossible.
[228:55.66]And I could only really map like four buttons or like five buttons to spells and abilities.
[229:01.56]So I would it worked technically, but I could really only do like three moves.
[229:07.55]So I had to just sit there and do the same like three or four move rotation.
[229:12.87]And it worked until I got to like level 22.
[229:14.67]And then I just gave up because I got too many abilities.
[229:31.96]How is that a problem with the Steam Controller?
[229:33.28]Because the Steam Controller has the pads.
[229:35.84]The track, the mouse pads to make it so you can actually utilize like a mouse or utilize like turning around and move.
[229:41.99]Like you can't map that kind of shit to, uh, you can't have a mouse be on like your Xbox controller.
[229:49.21]It's like the axis is too like finicky.
[229:53.74]Don't worry.
[229:54.24]In BFA, you only have four abilities anyways.
[229:59.20]I stopped playing after Legion.
[230:04.27]There's literally an add-on that solves your problem now.
[230:08.02]Well, back to World of Warcraft.
[230:17.44]I played, yeah, I played like three and a half years ago.
[230:19.54]I streamed.
[230:20.38]I streamed.
[230:22.69]Wow.
[230:23.31]Remember Karazhan?
[230:24.13]It's the worst stream, one of the top three worst streams I've ever done.
[230:27.49]You guys don't remember that?
[230:29.59]That was peak me trying to get the Steam controller to work.
[230:34.23]Why am I putting my headphones in?
[230:35.19]There's no reason to.
[230:35.73]There's no sounds.
[230:39.60]You can work your way up to an officer in my guild.
[230:46.10]Did he do the door handles tier list?
[230:49.58]Why the fuck would I ever do a door handles tier list?
[230:52.00]Put it in the chat.
[230:52.50]I'll do it next.
[230:54.30]Alright, I think I'm done.
[231:03.58]I'm happy with this.
[231:09.19]These are originals.
[231:13.83]Why is the fight stick lower than the GameCube keyboard?
[231:20.37]What is this, Karazhan 7.1 burp?
[231:30.22]I don't- because I don't use fight sticks.
[231:31.86]I don't know.
[231:41.46]Am I desynced?
[231:43.29]I shouldn't be.
[231:43.71]Alright, let's do door handles.
[231:51.91]Door handles, tier list.
[231:57.52]Right.
[232:02.86]This is fucking stupid.
[232:26.55]I'm more of like a toilet flush handle kind of guy.
[232:33.70]I don't like the just regular just little doorknobs because if you put moisturizer on your hands, you can't open them.
[232:40.74]You're stuck in the room if you have any like oil or moisturizer or anything.
[232:48.00]This is like a keypad.
[232:49.32]You have to remember a code.
[232:53.91]Wait a minute, this is a code and a toilet flusher.
[232:57.04]Okay, that's cool.
[233:00.84]These ones, fun fact about these doorknobs, guys, they're not secure at all.
[233:05.22]Because on the other end is a hole that's right in the middle of that fucking thing that somebody just has to stick a little pin in there and can pop the lock and open the door.
[233:17.79]Those are not secure.
[233:25.09]You can get into those.
[233:30.17]What is this one?
[233:30.79]I don't know.
[233:31.13]It looks exactly the fucking same.
[233:33.73]I'm not into this kind of stuff.
[233:35.79]It's too elaborate for me.
[233:36.98]Just give me the toilet handle.
[233:41.20]There's not even a door handle.
[233:42.50]That's a part of a train track.
[233:46.16]Crystal.
[233:46.58]Oh, that stuff breaks.
[233:51.18]There's a shower head.
[233:55.06]This is dumb.
[233:55.58]It's like a little turn.
[233:57.84]No, no, no.
[233:58.18]That's not.
[233:58.72]No.
[234:00.36]This is up at A. Because that's a. Because you can't fuck that up.
[234:06.08]You just you grab and you turn and push.
[234:13.93]No, this is like a. That's like a candy.
[234:19.19]No, again, put these down here and put that down here.
[234:21.25]Alright.
[234:32.57]I have a lot of C's and D's.
[234:38.17]Yeah, give me that thing any day.
[234:45.52]Rate the alphabet.
[234:51.58]That's dumber than this.
[234:54.25]Rate the alphabet?
[235:01.90]Uh, I'm not gonna do that.
[235:06.62]Rate the alphabet based on taste.
[235:16.46]Can I play a game now?
[235:17.60]Well, this stream today was just doing this stuff.
[235:21.72]Just hanging out doing tier lists and personality tests and combing my fucking hair.
[235:27.51]Rate video game companies.
[235:39.14]3,000 people are here watching him rank doorknobs.
[235:46.80]Well, when you put it like that.
[235:49.85]Cool math games?
[235:50.57]That's up there.
[235:51.05]Hold on.
[235:54.51]Where did I draw my rumble characters?
[235:57.49]I'm not doing the alphabet.
[236:00.83]Spider-Man movies?
[236:02.71]I can do that.
[236:11.07]No, don't put any spoilers in here, but I can do Spider-Man movies.
[236:13.96]Is this one legit?
[236:14.54]Alright, we'll do Spider-Man movies and then we'll see what else we're doing.
[236:24.97]We'll do cool math games.
[236:26.23]That's what we're going to end on.
[236:32.91]Okay.
[236:34.63]Let's do it.
[236:41.34]This isn't even all the Spider-Man movies.
[236:46.23]This is... Is this all of them?
[236:57.10]It is.
[236:58.36]No, it's not.
[237:00.00]Where's, uh... Where's Far From Home?
[237:11.74]Is it there?
[237:12.18]I mean, this is Homecoming.
[237:16.76]No, is it, which, where's Homecoming?
[237:18.34]Is that far from, that's far from home.
[237:19.58]Where's Homecoming?
[237:21.81]Is it, I don't recognize these posters.
[237:28.19]Okay.
[237:29.43]This is the first Spider-Man, right?
[237:31.13]Alright, Spider-Verse, I'm gonna, hold on.
[237:38.15]Spider-Verse is gonna stay there for just a second until I figure this out.
[237:43.53]Uh, Far From Home is going up here for a second.
[237:45.93]I loved Far From Home.
[237:47.01]I thought Far From Home was fucking awesome.
[237:48.89]I loved every second of Far From Home.
[237:54.69]It's literally like, I mean, Far... Far From Home is the best.
[238:14.80]Uh, where are the bad ones?
[238:16.02]Where are the ones where, like, where are the bad ones?
[238:17.90]It's amazing.
[238:18.46]Where's Amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2?
[238:24.20]This is Spider-Man 3, which was not that great, but it was alright still.
[238:30.14]This is the original, right?
[238:33.55]This one's really good, too.
[238:36.79]Mmm, this is gonna be tough.
[238:39.03]This is gonna be tough.
[238:42.47]Homecoming was fucking awesome, too.
[238:53.19]Where's Amazing Spider-Man 2?
[239:04.88]I loved Homecoming.
[239:06.86]I loved Homecoming and I loved Far From Home.
[239:16.46]Far From Home is my favorite.
[239:27.74]There's gotta be a bee.
[239:28.82]One of these has to be a bee.
[239:49.00]Dark Octopus in Spider-Man 2 is fucking unbelievable.
[240:21.52]I don't know which one is worse.
[240:22.60]I don't know which one.
[240:28.18]It's so hard because this movie was fucking incredible.
[240:29.96]It really was awesome.
[240:30.86]It was fucking awesome.
[240:32.68]But Michael Keaton is like one of my favorite actors ever.
[240:36.54]He's one of my favorite fucking actors.
[240:39.08]He's... I love Michael Keaton.
[240:51.86]What if I just don't have a B?
[241:03.29]No, but Green Goblin!
[241:04.53]It was too good!
[241:17.95]Spider-Man 1's a B. I agree with you if Willem Dafoe was not the Green Goblin.
[241:24.68]If any other actor is the Green Goblin, it's probably here.
[241:30.04]Now do a Michael Keaton movies tier list.
[242:12.87]Fixed.
[242:13.13]I'm done.
[242:16.35]Done.
[242:16.79]I fixed it.
[242:18.27]I'm good.
[242:23.50]I think that's good.
[242:33.16]Where's the Spider-Man PS4 game on this?
[242:36.06]Somewhere in here.
[242:37.52]Between B and A.
[242:42.66]The Muppets tier list?
[242:45.20]Oh, give me this right now.
[242:46.86]I'm going to spend a lot of time on this one.
[242:49.90]This is going to take at least an hour.
[242:52.90]There you go.
[242:53.50]Far From Home is my favorite Spider-Man movie.
[242:57.44]Oh, I loved it.
[242:59.14]Just that whole... I just love... I'm not going to talk about it, but fucking...
[243:07.04]I love that character.
[243:08.58]I love that character.
[243:10.60]I love that character.
[243:12.43]You know what I'm talking about.
[243:13.79]Fucking who cares.
[243:14.93]You'll watch it.
[243:15.55]It's good.
[243:22.05]I just came for the Muppets.
[243:24.33]You came to the stream for the Muppets.
[243:26.21]You came to the stream for the Muppets.
[243:27.67]I understand that.
[243:46.05]Is this all of them?
[243:52.19]This is not all of them.
[243:56.73]Who the fuck is this?
[244:01.12]Oh, Sweetums.
[244:01.70]This is my favorite.
[244:02.88]Oh, guys.
[244:03.46]Guys, don't wait for me, guys.
[244:05.16]Hold on.
[244:05.58]I can't believe.
[244:06.90]It's S. Sweetums is S tier.
[244:11.64]Don't forget about me.
[244:12.72]Oh, yeah.
[244:13.06]That should make a whole show around Sweetums.
[244:17.18]And the bear.
[244:17.68]Oh, right.
[244:18.14]Let me tell you what, General.
[244:19.48]Let me ask you a question.
[244:20.84]Yeah, Bobo the bear.
[244:21.80]S tier.
[244:22.04]Both of them.
[244:31.06]This is the paper towels guy?
[244:34.86]That's the paper towels guy, right?
[244:41.49]We're off on.
[244:41.83]Oh, we're off the top.
[244:42.65]Let me tell you something.
[244:44.81]Oh, I'm playing a song.
[244:45.81]Yep.
[244:51.65]The Swedish chef was just a fucking psycho, so he belongs up here too.
[245:03.01]Gonzo the Great.
[245:05.63]Fozzie, eh.
[245:17.70]This is gonna be hard.
[245:18.66]Oh, get them up here.
[245:20.62]They used to talk shit about the show.
[245:22.32]It was awesome.
[245:22.80]The Muppet Show.
[245:24.26]Every, I don't know, maybe every 15, after maybe 15, 20 minutes of the whole show, they would just cut to these guys and they were sitting in the booth in the theater and they would just make fun of the show.
[245:36.41]It was awesome.
[245:39.01]Just two old men just making fun of the show you're currently watching.
[245:43.11]It was fantastic.
[245:45.31]Waldorf and Statler, right?
[245:46.59]I gotta remember their names.
[245:47.47]It can't be up in S tier if I don't know their names.
[246:04.29]no this is this is like the I don't know this is like the new muppet that they I'm not a fan I'm not I'm not I don't hate it but I'm not it's just that I this is they made this character for one movie and then they brought up you know no no no no no rizzo the rat definitely up here
[246:34.34]Oh, this is the shit.
[246:35.06]Oh, man.
[246:35.94]The rats that belong up there.
[246:37.78]Oh, Dr. Teeth and the Electric Man.
[246:40.04]Get them up here.
[246:41.28]Get all of them up there.
[246:44.21]Where's the guitarist?
[246:49.39]Dr. Teeth and the Electric Man belong up here.
[246:51.77]In fact, you know what?
[246:52.57]I might have to do this.
[247:04.88]No, that's the Manamana guy.
[247:07.14]No.
[247:09.36]There he is.
[247:11.54]Okay.
[247:14.48]This is just one character, okay?
[247:19.24]This is like Dr. Teeth as a whole.
[247:30.28]Alright, you got Sweetums.
[247:32.01]Dr. Teeth as a whole.
[247:34.21]Statlin Worldoff, The Bear, and Rolf.
[247:40.75]And somebody just gave subs.
[247:42.39]Thank you, Clown Daddy, for the five community subs.
[247:49.89]Is this like a crossover character from The Office or something?
[247:52.08]Who is this?
[247:52.68]I don't know who this is.
[247:54.30]I really just don't know who it is.
[247:56.36]Miss Piggy's up there, too.
[247:57.42]Come on.
[247:59.15]They're like, , when she used to karate chop people.
[248:03.83]Miss Piggy used to karate chop people.
[248:07.71]She used to just fucking smash people.
[248:12.29]Oh, is it because of moi?
[248:23.05]Yeah, Miss Piggy was awesome.
[248:29.51]It's hard to place Kermit, though, because Kermit is, uh... Kermit's like the straight man in, like, the comedy, right?
[248:36.23]Always kind of collected, except when he throws his hands up and he goes like, Right, but he was kind of like the anchor of the whole thing.
[248:47.16]That kind of has to be, yeah, that has to be like a separate tier for Kermit.
[249:01.26]Where does the animal go?
[249:02.24]Animal goes because that's Dr. Teeth.
[249:05.38]I forgot to put animal up here.
[249:06.86]In fact, animal... I liked the saxophone guy.
[249:15.67]No, these are all collective unit.
[249:18.52]Too many S tier.
[249:19.22]No, this is all one group.
[249:20.84]It's a group.
[249:25.65]Oh, this is the pigs in space, right?
[249:28.57]Kind of a joke.
[249:29.49]Just like a joke off joke.
[249:30.83]It wasn't like a character.
[249:32.51]It was just kind of the pigs in space.
[249:35.69]Here's the mean eagle that used to hate everything.
[249:40.51]No, the eagle goes up here.
[249:46.08]The chickens were... They were cute, but like, I don't know.
[249:55.66]He's a .
[249:56.10]He's the guy that ran the whole show, produced the whole show.
[250:17.97]It's hard to place Pepe the Prawn because he's a great character, but he did like a Fortnite dance like a year ago.
[250:42.68]How do I have Gonzo in A?
[250:43.88]Because I've got two stupid people in A. Gonzo is probably up here.
[251:07.68]Do a beaker impression.
[251:10.16]Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[251:13.79]That'll be $100.
[251:15.23]I lied.
[251:16.14]It's a joke.
[251:16.54]I'm kidding.
[251:33.21]Was Miss Piggy cooler than the Swedish chef?
[251:38.79]Probably.
[251:42.62]Yeah, she was just, she, oh.
[251:48.29]Look, they're both doing the same thing.
[251:49.77]They're both doing like the same avatar pose.
[252:06.14]I'm gonna have to drop Kermit down one or two notches here because he is doing a YouTuber thumbnail pose.
[252:12.78]It's tricky.
[252:21.48]So is Fozzie.
[252:31.06]I like it.
[252:32.12]I'm good.
[252:38.39]Who is this guy?
[252:46.36]What is this?
[252:58.21]He's from the ABC show.
[253:05.75]I just don't... I don't even know what the context of this character is.
[253:14.86]He was in the Muppet Treasure Island movie.
[253:16.32]Really?
[253:19.08]Toothpaste tier list.
[253:21.58]Hmm.
[253:22.72]Oh, I gotta do Sesame Street.
[253:24.50]Yeah, I'll do Sesame Street.
[253:28.71]I'll give you a Sesame Street list.
[253:35.26]Take your picture.
[253:47.79]Okay.
[253:50.87]Get the count up there.
[253:52.45]Big bird.
[253:55.07]Grover.
[253:55.49]Grover is S. You cannot find a better Muppet character than Grover.
[254:00.09]Cookie Monster.
[254:05.90]This is Tully.
[254:12.31]Is that Guy Smiley?
[254:13.77]That's Guy Smiley.
[254:14.61]Guy Smiley belongs up here.
[254:19.54]Snuffleupagus.
[254:22.74]Elmo is... Okay, Elmo belongs somewhere up here.
[254:31.72]Where are those, um, there they are.
[254:33.26]I was gonna say, where are the two aliens that go like, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[254:38.54]They belong up here.
[254:41.43]Kermit, uh, Kermit was, we already did him.
[254:45.83]Oscar the Grouch.
[254:46.41]Where's Oscar the Grouch?
[255:06.92]I'm getting it done.
[255:12.40]Getting it done.
[255:18.38]The rest of these, I, um... Oh, this is the guy that doesn't like his spaghetti raw, Grover!
[255:25.09]Get them both up there.
[255:25.87]That's a fucking comedy team.
[255:27.39]That's the best comedy team that you'll ever see.
[255:34.12]Was Bert Nerney?
[255:36.08]Sorry, Bert Nerney.
[255:40.06]Not as good as Grover and Restaurant Guy.
[255:42.56]I remember these two.
[255:59.91]Who the fuck are all these other people?
[256:01.00]I don't know who they are.
[256:06.16]Uh, I know.
[256:10.06]Where's um, I remember you.
[256:17.90]I remember.
[256:18.42]I remember the cow.
[256:35.98]That's just Sherlock Holmes.
[256:42.00]Oh, the little bug alien family, right?
[256:48.28]Where's Snuffleupagus?
[256:49.06]He's right here.
[256:55.55]Weren't these, okay, weren't these just like New York construction workers?
[257:01.27]They were like the construction workers from New York, right?
[257:10.42]Why are there two counts?
[257:11.44]Wait, is this not the count?
[257:13.04]That's like a magician.
[257:23.12]The count goes up here.
[257:27.27]No, you go over here.
[257:29.09]You're better than the two aliens.
[257:38.33]You're probably better than Guy Smiley.
[257:44.12]No, baby bear sucks.
[257:47.66]I don't like baby bear.
[257:50.52]Now... I do it by... Let me see the voices.
[257:59.61]The voices... No, baby bear.
[258:01.99]Oh, no.
[258:02.39]What happened to me?
[258:03.62]Baby bear, right?
[258:04.62]That's baby bear?
[258:05.72]Tell me if that's the one that I think it is.
[258:07.28]It's a...
[258:19.28]How could I?
[258:19.68]The worm, yeah, has to be up here.
[258:38.25]That's the best character.
[258:45.07]I don't recognize very many of these other characters.
[258:51.10]This is kind of just like scruffy Elmo.
[258:55.70]This is like Elmo, but like a fan in front of him.
[259:00.84]Is this like Snoopy and Spike?
[259:03.08]I don't know who that is.
[259:07.80]Is this like an owl or is that Gizmo from Gremlins?
[259:13.92]I don't know.
[259:16.06]I've kind of recognized this person, but not really.
[259:23.87]I don't know who these people are.
[259:26.66]I recognize her.
[259:39.80]I see some of these.
[259:43.69]But I'm just not sure.
[259:47.19]No, you're better than Gaius Merli.
[259:48.35]Gaius Merli.
[259:55.76]That's not true.
[259:58.20]Like, who is that?
[260:02.66]Like, who are these two?
[260:05.54]Are these new?
[260:06.31]I mean, obviously I haven't watched Sesame Street in a long time.
[260:17.07]I don't know who any of these people are.
[260:20.01]I kind of recognize them, but not really.
[260:23.12]The horse, I feel like if I know the cow, I should know the horse.
[260:58.66]done super grover is s no that's just implied that super grover is grover they're the same person he just puts a cape on and flies now do Looney Tunes get let's see it that just looked like in the camera that I bent my arm my wrist all the way backwards and then all the way forward so that was weird looking
[261:36.01]Should I just look for it?
[261:36.87]Have we got a good one?
[261:46.34]Fraggle Rock.
[261:47.02]Fraggle Rock was a great show.
[261:49.74]I'll do Looney Tunes list.
[261:51.76]I've got it up here kind of in my brain already.
[261:56.39]Game developer is a definitive edition.
[262:00.29]Looney Tunes list.
[262:02.15]Let's try this one.
[262:05.80]Do the Pringles tier list.
[262:07.32]I don't need to do the Pringles tier list.
[262:12.26]Holy shit.
[262:13.48]Okay.
[262:32.38]The characters pop up like this five times.
[262:36.16]Like Sylvester the Cat, I've seen him at least four times.
[262:48.03]There's too many.
[262:48.63]I gotta do a different one.
[262:49.33]There's too many.
[262:55.78]Looney Tuna?
[263:00.04]I think there's one right here.
[263:05.08]Sorry, I'm like sniffing, you guys.
[263:09.27]Is this better?
[263:10.45]Alright, this looks a little better, I think.
[263:13.99]Or, no, no, no, these are like, this is... I don't know who have to, this, no, this is like, this is like Hanna-Barbera.
[263:25.58]These aren't Looney Tunes.
[263:33.47]No, that one doesn't look accurate.
[263:43.25]This one's like Looney Tunes characters.
[263:50.99]Game developers?
[263:52.59]Is Looney Tunes not going to work?
[263:59.68]How many game developers are on this list?
[264:05.68]Oh my god, this is going to take forever.
[264:09.46]I don't even recognize some of these.
[264:12.54]Let me see.
[264:13.42]Hold on.
[264:17.65]Can I just do like a few?
[264:18.91]Because I don't even know some of these.
[264:26.87]Do you have it listed as mobile?
[264:28.77]Why do I even have a mobile tier?
[264:33.44]This is the first one I did.
[264:43.15]Okay, let's... I can do it.
[264:45.45]I can do it.
[264:47.31]I can do it.
[264:53.86]Maybe I can't.
[264:54.32]No, I can't.
[264:58.50]Activision... Why is Infinity War... Infinity War?
[265:07.29]Is a... Oh, Infinity Ward.
[265:11.05]Inf...

[265:46.94]Get that up there.
[265:47.64]I don't know who...
[265:51.21]Is this blizzard 2019 or blizzard?
[265:52.43]Like 2000?

[266:47.48]Oh, HAL Labs.

[266:55.03]Smash Brothers.
[267:01.31]Konami.
[267:03.03]Not very good.
[267:03.71]Double Fine.
[267:04.39]Not very good.
[267:09.69]Yacht Club Games.
[267:14.07]That's like rare, right?
[267:18.17]Oddworld Inhabitants.
[267:19.19]They just make Oddworld, right?
[267:22.27]Bungie, I don't like it.
[267:26.95]Is there any, are there really any games companies on here that I actually know?
[267:32.47]I don't play games, I don't play League.
[267:43.28]That's 2019 Rare, shit, you're right.
[268:00.36]Shit, every game company sucks in 2019.
[268:04.26]Even Valve.
[268:22.30]I don't know yet.
[268:35.42]Sucker Punch?
[268:44.86]What is Sucker Punch Studios?
[268:52.17]Sly Cooper?
[268:55.93]No, no, Valve is not under E. I gotta just get them in the right spot and then move them around.
[268:59.23]You guys know how this works.
[268:59.99]We've been doing this for like three hours.
[269:06.93]Sly Cooper, what else have they done though?
[269:09.05]I don't really play Sly Cooper.
[269:13.97]Microsoft, not very good.
[269:20.21]Level five, that's Metroid?
[269:23.53]But 2019 level five, they haven't really done anything, right?
[269:34.33]No, what is level five?
[269:44.43]Professor Layton.
[269:46.19]Oh, okay.
[269:52.18]I didn't really play that much Professor Layton.
[269:58.62]I'm just pulling the ones that I recognize.
[270:01.39]This is Halo, right?
[270:04.47]I don't... I'm going to make another... Hold on.
[270:07.43]That's not F. Just hold on.
[270:16.19]I'm going to do... Not enough experience.
[270:22.57]Not enough experience.
[270:24.77]Because I've never played any of the Halo games.
[270:29.82]I don't really play any of the... I don't play League.
[270:40.80]I'll fix this later.
[270:42.00]What about... I didn't really play Sly...
[270:49.64]Okay, I'm gonna, it's not, I'm gonna fix it.
[270:53.22]Atari.
[270:54.96]Rocksteady is pretty good.
[270:56.32]2019 though, what have they done?
[270:57.76]What was the last thing they did?
[271:02.11]It's like the Batman games, right?
[271:07.03]What's this like underwater dog cat thing?
[271:10.67]Sucker Punch made Infamous.
[271:12.21]I didn't play it.
[271:14.17]I tried to, remember I tried to stream Infamous and it didn't work?
[271:18.35]I have never played it.
[271:23.83]Oh, that's the... Stardew.
[271:25.67]Okay.
[271:32.91]It's software.
[271:33.67]It's up there somewhere.
[271:37.15]Team Ninja.
[271:38.10]I haven't really played very many of those games.
[271:40.94]Bioware.
[271:49.56]LucasArts doesn't even exist anymore, but when it existed...
[272:09.96]They made some good games, but... Warner Brothers... What's the last few things... What's the last few games that Warner Brothers has done?
[272:27.24]The Lord of the Rings games?
[272:28.56]Shadow of War?
[272:30.44]It was alright.
[272:31.40]That was pretty good.
[272:35.70]Those were good.
[272:43.66]I don't play a whole lot of Atlas localized games.
[272:47.97]Sonic Team.
[272:48.77]I haven't really made a good Sonic game in a while.
[272:53.85]NetherRealm is... The Mortal Kombat's have been pretty good recently.
[272:59.45]I'll figure it out later.
[273:06.17]There's the Tony Hawk Company.
[273:10.11]But this is not a fair list.
[273:15.97]Because some of these companies don't even exist anymore.
[273:24.87]NCSoft.
[273:34.35]This is The Last Guardian and Shadow of the Colossus.
[273:44.88]It's up there somewhere.
[273:49.35]That game was really sloppy, but it was really, really interesting.
[273:56.48]And plus Shadow of the Colossus is really great.
[274:01.80]You can't deny that Minecraft wasn't like a huge success, but I don't think it, I personally don't, I'm not going to put it in B.
[274:16.61]Take two is like all the sports games.
[274:21.09]And technically GTA, but they publish.
[274:24.67]They don't really make, they don't really develop, right?
[274:38.66]Naughty Dog?
[274:40.67]Naughty Dog's doing pretty well.
[274:46.04]Like, actually, like, really well.
[274:51.32]I have to, I'm gonna, I'll head back to this.
[275:02.11]The rest of these, I kind of, I don't really know what they were.
[275:05.29]Turtle Rock, they made Evolve, right?
[275:11.61]Square Enix.
[275:15.77]So iDOS, iDOS is technically what, IO now?
[275:25.18]Like, no, that's like Hitman, but it's not.
[275:26.82]Was IO interactive on here?
[275:34.90]I don't see IO interactive on here.
[275:39.61]So should I put, should I do iDOS as if it is Hitman?
[275:52.89]Because Eidos technically was Hitman, but it wasn't.
[275:55.43]But it was.
[275:56.79]I'm going to pretend that this is a Hitman company.
[276:07.20]No, that's not supposed to be there.
[276:14.40]nexon this is like the massive multiplayer company that they like half of the mmos you see that pop up in like an ad on the side of your youtube page is by nexon monolith uh monolith did the ones are the ones that were responsible for shadow of Mordor
[276:44.42]If I'm going to put WB up here, then Monolith should be up here too.
[276:49.90]Higher than that.
[276:55.92]Too many video game companies.
[276:58.86]Dice.
[277:02.18]Not doing it for me.
[277:03.62]Not doing it for me.
[277:06.11]Game Freak.
[277:06.77]Now this is Pokémon.
[277:08.21]I'll tell you, it has to go down here because I don't have much experience with Pokémon.
[277:12.93]Old Acclaim.
[277:14.84]Here's the thing about Old Acclaim.
[277:16.64]All their games were dog shit.
[277:18.82]But they all were charming in some kind of way.
[277:22.04]Their games were terrible.
[277:23.80]But they did a lot of interesting things.
[277:25.82]That's going to be a D.
[277:42.96]All I remember is the old WWF Acclaim games.
[277:46.30]And they were so bad.
[277:50.28]Valve Below EA.
[277:51.42]I'm not, just wait, wait.
[277:53.00]I'm not done with the list.
[277:54.12]I have to get everybody in the right spot.
[277:55.72]And then from there, we add on to it.
[277:59.64]And I put that, look, I'm just getting them in the general idea.
[278:03.74]This is just, they're going to change.
[278:05.24]It's not like, wait, rare issue about Blizzard.
[278:07.84]Just hold on.
[278:10.08]Just, I got, there's a lot to compress here.
[278:15.71]What is this one?
[278:19.45]Firaxis?
[278:24.61]What's Firaxis?
[278:30.65]Civilization?
[278:32.12]XCOM?
[278:32.66]I don't have enough experience with it.
[278:34.96]The rest of these I really don't know.
[278:36.56]Obsidian is good.
[278:39.24]But we'll see how their new game is.
[278:42.28]Who knows?
[278:44.70]Coffee Stain is... That's like the goat simulator team, right?
[278:49.10]And they did some other... What else have they done?
[278:57.55]What else have they done?
[279:00.25]I don't know.
[279:03.60]Sanctum.
[279:04.94]Coffee Stain.
[279:09.60]um Deep Rock they published Deep Rock but they didn't develop it does that count maybe I guess it does in a way okay where is oh god this is gonna be hell sorting through
[279:36.25]quantic dream I don't think I have enough experience didn't they make one game it was like a movie game grasshopper is we'll see we'll see when the new no more heroes comes up because they haven't really done anything good at all in the last like at least probably four or five years it's tough
[280:10.48]Oh, they're the... Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[280:13.86]I liked Detroit Become Human.
[280:14.90]I thought it was fun.
[280:21.75]No More Heroes is awesome.
[280:24.55]But I haven't really done anything in a long time.
[280:30.97]That I really played.
[280:32.01]That I thought was interesting.
[280:36.10]How do I alienate every gamer?
[280:40.60]Except for the people that like FromSoftware, Sony, Capcom, Rockstar, Nintendo, Naughty Dog Interplay, Midway, HAL Laboratories, Rocksteady, Stardew Valley Guy, LucasArts, Aiko, Eidos, and Bandai Namco.
[280:52.57]Except for all those people.
[281:02.72]Rockstar at A?
[281:05.72]GTA V was fucking awesome.
[281:09.69]Red Dead Redemption 2 was really fun.
[281:15.28]One of these is going to BS.
[281:20.70]You gotta wait.
[281:21.58]Let me do my first draft.
[281:23.28]I'm still trying to juggle of what the hell EHA Games is.
[281:29.32]I don't know what this is.
[281:34.16]What is this one?
[281:47.06]I don't know what it is.
[281:48.12]Somebody can tell me?
[281:51.07]Alright, the reason why Capcom is up here is because the last like four or five games that Capcom has come up with have been awesome.
[281:58.37]Resident Evil 2 was fucking awesome.
[282:00.57]Monster Hunter: World was awesome.
[282:06.02]I Heard Devil May Cry was awesome.
[282:10.08]I mean, they've been knocking it out of the park recently.
[282:13.86]You guys told me 2019.
[282:21.44]Resident Evil 2 was fantastic.
[282:22.82]It was really, really, really, really fucking good.
[282:28.63]Do you think that Capcom in the last few years should be below, like, Epic Games?
[282:36.51]Unless you, like, play Fortnite.
[282:46.14]No, okay, look.
[282:48.12]All the companies that are in B and C...
[282:51.23]I have not gone over and thought about it yet.
[282:53.75]This is going to take a long time.
[282:57.03]Let me just remember.
[282:57.59]Okay, Insomniac.
[282:58.81]Insomniac made the new Spider-Man one, right?
[283:03.09]They're up here.
[283:04.63]That new Spider-Man game was really, really, really fucking good.
[283:06.90]So, up here.
[283:09.26]I'll figure it out in a minute.
[283:12.26]Yacht Club Games made Shovel Knight.
[283:13.92]I didn't really play it that much.
[283:15.02]Irrational Games.
[283:18.54]What the hell is that?
[283:22.99]It's so familiar.
[283:23.77]What is it?
[283:30.29]BioShock?
[283:33.41]Right.
[283:33.85]Okay.
[283:34.21]Right, right, right, right, right, right, right, right.
[283:36.78]BioShock Infinite was good.
[283:39.50]But then they got liquidated, right?
[283:52.63]Was it?
[283:53.05]Was it?
[283:53.35]I remember liking BioShock Infinite.
[283:55.57]I thought it was fun.
[283:58.55]I mean, BioShock 1... Pandemic.
[284:05.87]Help me out here.
[284:08.55]This is like every video game company.
[284:10.28]I'm trying.
[284:12.70]Pandemic was... what?
[284:23.19]battlefront destroy all humans okay alright alright okay hold on I liked those respawn entertainment that's uh it's like yeah I don't I don't play their games
[284:52.28]Atari doesn't really exist anymore.
[284:55.60]They still kind of do.
[284:57.04]What's the last thing they... Isn't the last game they made like a Dragon Ball Z fighting game?
[285:14.05]I have not enough experience recently.
[285:17.68]I know they're a classic company, but we're talking like recently.
[285:20.66]Like the last five to ten years.
[285:21.96]No.
[285:22.14]Oh, I don't know where the fuck they belong.
[285:24.44]Probably up here.
[285:29.36]Santa Monica Studio is the God of War studio, right?
[285:34.99]Or is that technically Sony?
[285:44.91]They belong up here.
[285:52.00]It's God of War, yeah.
[285:52.78]Okay.
[285:53.28]Yep.
[285:55.68]No, they belong up here.
[285:57.62]All their games are, like, just always good.
[286:03.69]Sierra... Like, it's hard to mix in these really old-ass fucking companies with the ones that are currently... You know what I mean?
[286:14.91]There's too many.
[286:23.74]Impressive game?
[286:25.94]What is impressive games?
[286:27.84]What did they do?
[286:29.56]No, that's supermassive games.
[286:39.05]Until Dawn.
[286:46.01]Here's the thing.
[286:47.89]Trying to do this is tricky because...
[286:52.41]Not only is it the games that they made, but each company has like a separate tier of games that they've made.
[287:00.33]So, alright, like SEGA, for instance, SEGA as a whole exists.
[287:04.63]And then when you double click SEGA, you get the big dropdown of like 50 games.
[287:10.19]So try, it's hard to place them.
[287:20.77]This tier list is fucked.
[287:22.15]Well, hold on.
[287:22.53]Let me do this first.
[287:25.13]I know it's going to be like this.
[287:38.09]Let me work backwards.
[288:39.87]It's taking a lot of brain power to do this.
[288:41.52]Alright.
[288:50.86]This is Hitman, right?
[288:51.65]This is Hitman.
[289:04.32]I'm working it up, see?
[289:07.38]Why are you doing an L.A.
[289:09.27]Noire face?
[289:11.91]So where were you at 4 o'clock Eastern Time?
[289:15.52]Were you in front of the store?
[289:38.79]I can't even fucking do it now.
[289:40.81]All I think about is you guys looking at me with like three buttons that are watching my face.
[289:50.62]Gearbox is down here.
[289:51.72]I don't... I'm so... Gear... I'm telling you.
[290:03.44]We're good.
[290:05.04]Gearbox is...
[290:10.78]I don't... Borderlands... You could... Borderlands... I don't care about Borderlands.
[290:16.38]No, it's not F. It's... Why are these even on here?
[290:37.94]Bethesda is still, like, making games though.
[290:40.94]Konami is not.
[290:43.42]Let's just be very, very clear about this.
[290:47.05]Konami doesn't even make fucking video games anymore.
[290:52.07]Didn't they, like, abandon their video game developments?
[291:05.98]EA is very close to a D-, but hold on, let's get back up here.
[291:11.84]Naughty Dog versus Insomniac.
[291:16.74]I think I'm going to leave this alone.
[291:18.19]I think this is accurate.
[291:20.11]Hold on, what was the last couple Nintendo games that I played?
[291:35.69]Mario Maker 2.
[291:37.03]Smash Brothers.
[291:39.93]No, yeah, no, they're still making really good stuff.
[291:42.15]They are.
[291:43.85]So is Rockstar.
[291:47.31]So is Capcom.
[291:48.29]So is Sony.
[291:49.09]Santa Monica just released, like, one of the best games, like, ever fucking made, right?
[291:52.06]Like, ever.
[291:54.36]According to a lot of people.
[291:55.90]I haven't played it.
[291:56.42]I don't know.
[291:57.32]I've played some of the other ones.
[291:58.64]It's a lie.
[292:01.94]The Labo exists.
[292:03.08]That's right.
[292:03.56]Alright, hold on.
[292:12.34]Hitman is awesome.
[292:13.32]It's a ton of fun.
[292:17.67]But also, remember, this is a Defunct Studios, so it's hard to do this.
[292:23.91]Blitz the League 2 exists because this company decided to have it.
[292:27.63]That means a lot.
[292:38.22]We're just in B right now.
[292:40.66]We're just in B.
[293:00.43]Dip it into C, but hold on.
[293:04.37]I don't know if LucasArts should be up here.
[293:27.29]Technically...
[293:29.83]Technically, games like TF2, Dota, and CSGO, they still get updates.
[293:36.91]Technically.
[293:37.55]So, I mean, you can't... Valve has a bunch of stuff in development right now, don't they?
[293:49.44]This would be all the way up here.
[293:50.96]It would.
[293:51.38]But Valve being down at C is already like a huge fucking issue.
[293:56.64]That's a huge deal.
[294:00.26]Can you imagine this list five years ago?
[294:03.64]If Valve wasn't up here, I would be a crazy person.
[294:07.52]So this is already very bad.
[294:28.03]Bungie shouldn't be down that far.
[294:41.12]Rare has to do something.
[294:45.02]Rare has to do something.
[294:49.33]Rare... They have to go down here.
[294:50.63]I'm sorry, they do.
[294:51.29]They have to do something.
[294:52.51]They have to make a game.
[294:56.23]No, I know, but Rare... Rare allowing Banjo to be a character that is a cool character that exists.
[295:05.51]Banjo is a character, it's from a classic video game series.
[295:16.57]If you don't want spoilers for anything, mute right now.
[295:19.21]If you don't want any spoilers for anything, just mute right now.
[295:22.59]I'm going to just say spoilers.
[295:23.75]So mute right now if you don't want any spoilers for something.
[295:26.36]Mute.
[295:27.58]I'll go like this.
[295:29.81]um some people don't want to know the characters in smash until they like actually get their hands on it so that's like a literal like a video game like Marvel spoiler um them allowing banjo in you know I'm saying that's not them they didn't do that is your hair in a bun what do you mean what what the fuck
[295:58.76]How long has this been in my hair for?
[296:02.59]Did I start combing my hair this morning and just stopped?
[296:06.59]Thank you for catching that.
[296:07.65]How the fuck?
[296:11.01]No.
[296:12.59]Holy shit, dude.
[296:13.25]Like, thanks for catching that.
[296:14.23]That would have been in there until I woke up tomorrow morning.
[296:20.41]Damn.
[296:23.09]Uh, where was I?
[296:23.91]Oh, yeah.
[296:25.48]Alright, you can come back.
[296:27.84]They have to make a game.
[296:29.83]They gotta make something.
[296:31.07]And yeah, they made Sea of Thieves.
[296:34.70]But... Was Sea of Thieves better than Overwatch?
[296:48.07]I don't know.
[296:51.55]This is too hard.
[296:52.83]It's too hard.
[296:53.33]I give up.
[296:54.01]This is too hard.
[296:58.01]No, it wasn't.
[296:58.73]It's too hard.
[296:59.37]There's too many things.
[297:02.41]There's too many things.
[297:03.17]There's too many things.
[297:03.97]There's too much.
[297:08.95]Overwatch was good, though.
[297:09.91]Overwatch was fucking really fun.
[297:12.13]When it first came out, I really thought it was a really fun game.
[297:15.87]I really liked it.
[297:18.07]But that's it.
[297:19.69]Everything else they've done has been just stepping in quicksand.
[297:27.24]Since they released Overwatch, Blizzard has just been sinking in quicksand and just going, hey, what's wrong?
[297:34.93]Oh.
[297:36.69]Oh, Overwatch just released.
[297:38.91]Cool new game.
[297:39.67]That's a team-based arena shooter.
[297:42.25]Awesome.
[297:46.27]Anybody like the old games that we made before?
[297:47.93]Do you like, no, you do?
[297:50.87]Yeah, Warcraft 3 is coming up.
[297:52.92]Classic.
[297:54.63]I mean, we talked about that like probably 10 years ago, but it's happening now.
[297:59.81]You guys have phones?
[298:02.70]What's wrong?
[298:04.78]What, you guys don't have a phone?
[298:09.24]Am I getting smaller?
[298:12.14]Hey, all of our CEOs are leaving.
[298:16.02]There's nothing wrong with that, right?
[298:19.95]Oh, like more employees?
[298:22.57]Like top level employees are gone?
[298:28.02]What's wrong with my mouth?
[298:29.24]What's happening?
[298:30.76]What's my chin touching?
[298:32.86]What is this?
[298:33.78]This is what you do!
[298:40.31]Diablo 4 is gonna Diablo 4 is coming out!
[298:53.03]We're gonna put WoW Classic out and then Elasticsearch
[299:02.29]Diablo II Remastered.
[299:05.59]Diablo II Remastered Edition.
[299:09.16]Overwatch 2.
[299:10.50]Overwatch 2 is coming out.
[299:11.92]Give me a break.
[299:21.42]I lost the calm.
[299:25.12]Is that?
[299:25.46]Okay.
[299:28.38]Overwatch 2.
[299:29.78]What the?
[299:30.56]What's going on?
[299:33.15]This comes down here because of the Diablo Mobile and Overwatch 2.
[299:36.29]They're gonna... Why is Maxis in D?
[299:56.24]It's not!
[300:13.07]But Blizzard's better than Tim Horton's studio.
[300:18.05]Whatever, what is it?
[300:23.01]What's his name?
[300:24.51]Tim Schafer.
[300:36.03]They're all riding on like, hey, Psychonauts 2, right?
[300:39.55]Psychonauts 2, maybe it's up here.
[300:42.99]It's possible.
[300:43.53]You can't do this.
[300:49.51]Why is Bethesda at the top of D?
[300:51.17]I don't know.
[300:52.57]I'm having a lot of trouble.
[301:19.61]I just almost threw up.
[301:36.34]You're stressing yourself out way too much.
[301:38.42]I know, but this is my legacy.
[301:41.07]Don't you know?
[301:42.63]This is my legacy.
[301:44.93]I'm leaving this behind, right?
[301:47.01]Like 100 years from now, they're going to be like, I wonder what he thought about all these things.
[301:52.06]It's my fucking legacy.
[302:01.52]How is ICO not an A?
[302:02.82]We're getting...
[302:10.62]Listen to me.
[302:12.48]The issue with doing a video game company tier list is as if every single one of these was a version of In-N-Out.
[302:21.62]Moving one of these causes a huge issue for a bunch of people.
[302:26.06]Every one of these is In-N-Out Burger.
[302:28.18]But like In-N-Out, different variations of it.
[302:38.83]So all of them are bad.
[302:39.77]I didn't say it.
[302:43.51]I didn't say that, you did.
[302:44.27]I have to, okay.
[302:59.50]If this is the thing that people remember you for, I'm sorry.
[303:03.66]Not anything else.
[303:06.78]Yeah.
[303:07.74]That's true.
[303:19.06]If this is what I leave behind, then I didn't leave very much.
[303:24.12]Yeah, I have thousands of hours of online content.
[303:27.04]Thousands of hours.
[303:29.18]This is my legacy?
[303:30.50]That's embarrassing.
[303:36.96]I don't even know what some of the... Alright.
[303:41.58]Remedy.
[303:49.38]You're shafting Valve?
[303:50.46]If you've gotten your Orange Box Origins... That's why Valve's not down here.
[303:55.28]Valve, like, Artifact, like, wasn't... Like, a big deal, and people... I didn't think it was any... I didn't really was interested... I wasn't interested at all.
[304:04.19]I didn't really... I wasn't interested in Dota...
[304:06.92]They had like a bunch of other projects they kind of swept under the rug.
[304:16.79]I'm only doing this because of... I'm only doing this because of the spy.
[304:28.61]Dota Underlords is worse than the game mode in Dota.
[304:30.73]This is the fucking craziest thing, guys.
[304:32.25]Do you understand what's happening in video games right now?
[304:36.87]You have a game, a video game that was a mod for StarCraft, which then became a mod for WarCraft, which then turned into a full game
[304:55.04]which then that full game was, oh, we're gonna make that one too.
[305:00.35]So that is a sort of copy of a mod.
[305:05.90]And then you have,
[305:08.31]Inside of that copy of a mod, you have a mod inside of that game that was a mod, which was auto chess, and is now becoming a mod of a copy of a copy of a mod from a game from 1998.
[305:27.28]What in the name of God is happening?
[305:33.66]What's going on?
[305:42.11]mod game mod game original mod yo dude I heard you like mods it's just chess now my point is is that it's a everyone start people are starting to want to make their own auto chesses now and they want to make their own auto chesses based inside of a game that was a mod it's wild
[306:08.95]I almost want to make a chart that shows the originations of where all these things came from.
[306:17.55]It's so interesting.
[306:23.20]Fortnite auto chess.
[306:28.96]I'm about to detonate the whole thing.
[306:34.50]The first two or three rows, it's going to be too hard.
[306:46.45]And there's all this shit I don't even know where to put.
[306:47.95]Here comes a volcano joke.
[307:00.46]Why is EA not S tier?
[307:05.86]I got a thousand voices in my head.
[307:11.10]All you need to know, just, I'm going to cover this up.
[307:13.60]This is all you need.
[307:14.12]This is, like, 2019.
[307:14.54]This is, like, what I think.
[307:18.10]Hey, this is pretty much all you need.
[307:20.36]Like, there you go.
[307:21.22]Like, this is, like, that's just, this is his list.
[307:24.36]Writer.
[307:26.46]FromSoftware, Nintendo, Rockstar, Capcom, Sony, Santa Monica, Insomniac, Naughty Dog, Eidos, Stardew Guy, HAL Laboratories, Rocksteady, the, well, I don't know why these are up here.
[307:36.81]Obsidian, Monolith, Valve is, like, right here.
[307:39.13]Valve is up here.
[307:39.81]Valve, okay, Valve.
[307:44.02]Wasn't the last Mortal Kombat game trash?
[307:48.09]I don't know.
[307:48.59]I... Was it?
[307:55.24]I thought it was good.
[307:56.56]Didn't people really like it?
[307:57.52]Alright.
[308:00.88]That's it.
[308:05.87]I just hit myself in a really bad place accidentally.
[308:16.77]And it was right on there.
[308:21.55]That was really, really close to being a huge issue.
[308:24.31]I just whacked myself in the thigh area.
[308:30.67]I'm good.
[308:30.87]Alright, we're going to finish this stream up with some cool math games.
[308:48.66]But which one am I going to even play?
[308:49.88]I need my headphones for this.
[308:54.73]Five hours of this?
[308:56.03]Damn, I've been having a pretty good time.
[308:58.93]It's kind of been flown by.
[309:01.33]So tomorrow, let's talk about tomorrow.
[309:03.87]I'm thinking of doing DOS again.
[309:09.02]You want to do a DOS night tomorrow?
[309:10.94]Tomorrow night?
[309:12.04]Okay, the internet's been a lot better.
[309:18.98]People have been waiting for that for a long time.
[309:23.78]We'll go back to DOS tomorrow.
[309:27.50]Somebody says play Run 2.
[309:29.62]Alright, I'll try Run 2.
[309:40.83]What is Run 2?
[309:45.55]Select a character, runner or skater.
[309:51.12]Hold on.
[309:51.76]I gotta get the window in here.
[309:59.95]Run to... I've never played this.
[310:04.29]How is this a math game?
[310:17.90]Do I have to solve puzzles or something?
[310:24.50]Because it's cool.
[310:25.52]It's not a math game.
[310:29.98]Okay.
[310:31.18]So it's just a cool game.
[310:34.18]Doesn't have anything to do with math.
[310:35.78]At all.
[310:41.87]Okay.
[310:43.51]This might be loud.
[310:44.25]I'm going to turn it down.
[310:45.79]Alright.
[310:46.81]Controls.
[310:48.73]Left.
[310:50.02]Space.
[310:51.40]Pause and reset.
[310:52.28]So just jump.
[310:55.22]Okay.
[310:55.76]I'm gonna... Easier to control, can't jump as far.
[310:58.62]Hard to... Jumps farther and hard to control.
[311:05.89]Use the right and left arrow keys to move side.
[311:08.17]This is really, really fucking loud.
[311:12.63]Collect all the... It's better.
[311:20.33]Okay, uh... See if you can collect the bonuses.
[311:31.36]Alright.
[311:32.98]Alright!
[311:36.68]First contact with a wall.
[311:38.02]Bonus not earned.
[311:40.55]Select level.
[311:43.01]Okay, let's go.
[311:43.81]Level 2.
[311:45.87]It's the wrong way.
[311:47.93]How do I get... Oh.
[311:53.79]This is why it's a math game, right?
[311:57.95]How do I get that one?
[312:10.95]How do I get this bonus?
[312:11.75]I don't know how to get this bonus.
[312:37.02]Oh, you can jump into the walls.
[312:39.95]I didn't know that you could do that.
[312:49.23]I thought you had to touch them on the side.
[312:50.61]I don't get to get the bonuses.
[312:55.45]Who gives a shit?
[313:04.23]Alright, this is like a little... Got it!
[313:09.90]You can catch here, but you cannot catch here.
[313:12.02]Okay.
[313:27.82]This is a baby game?
[313:28.96]This is a cool math game, actually.
[313:42.88]I'm good.
[313:50.36]Shit.
[313:56.91]This is actually kind of... This is pretty fun.
[314:03.21]Do run three or I'm going to pee my pants.
[314:06.11]Oh, go for it, man.
[314:16.64]This takes a lot of concentration.
[314:18.06]Can I not get up there?
[314:18.76]Oh, I got it.
[314:26.87]Bonus.
[314:28.15]Fuck.
[314:36.49]Damn it.
[314:36.84]Whatever.
[314:54.67]Shit.
[315:02.86]You gotta go to the right.
[315:05.66]Up.
[315:06.64]Up.
[315:07.64]Up.
[315:08.44]Right.
[315:09.27]Up.
[315:18.77]Fuck the bonuses.
[315:20.65]How many levels are there in Run 2?
[315:26.04]Could I just do like a Mario slide skip right there?
[315:32.02]Uh... It's not that easy, is it?
[315:34.18]Apparently it is.
[315:39.57]There's 500 levels.
[315:42.85]Well, I won't be doing this for that long.
[315:50.87]Come on.
[315:51.25]I can make that.
[315:55.19]Oh, shit.
[315:55.49]I gotta...
[316:02.40]Damn it.
[316:06.65]Fuck.
[316:18.78]Come on.
[316:34.63]What?!
[316:40.79]Oh my god, I'm so stupid!
[316:41.87]I have to wait!
[316:42.47]Wait!
[317:01.78]Why am I addicted to this cool bath game?
[317:05.21]Whatever, just end it.
[317:05.81]Holy shit.
[317:23.85]What is going on?
[317:25.43]Alright, I can... Hold on, I can drop down.
[317:27.29]Drop down and get this.
[317:28.49]Jump.
[317:28.97]Over jump.
[317:29.59]Over jump.
[317:31.59]Damn it.
[317:37.05]Damn!
[317:39.44]I didn't even get the bonus and I went the harder way.
[318:01.99]Forget it, just do...
[318:16.20]It's okay.
[318:18.32]Oh my God.
[318:18.84]Okay.
[318:18.96]I'm good.
[318:30.71]Oh man.
[318:34.07]My fingers are getting really greasy.
[318:45.05]Really?
[318:54.58]That didn't turn?
[318:56.44]Why?
[319:02.08]What the?
[319:02.76]Okay.
[319:13.25]Didn't a game come out that was called Cluster Truck that was like this?
[319:15.55]Alright, I'm gonna go up and then up.
[319:27.00]Forget about it.
[319:32.00]Alright, I'm gonna get to level 20.
[319:42.86]Ugh!
[319:44.08]Fuck!
[319:47.82]Slow down.
[319:48.44]Get your greasy hands.
[319:52.35]Ugh.
[319:54.69]Look at me.
[319:55.03]I'm starting to sweat.
[319:55.73]I really am.
[319:57.14]My zit's going to be like five times bigger at the end of this.
[320:05.14]It's going to literally take on a mind of its own.
[320:08.88]This pimple is going to start talking by the end of this stream.
[320:28.80]Doesn't improved imply not new.
[320:30.72]So, how would you do this with the other character?
[320:42.57]I feel like this would be hard to do unless you were moving fast.
[320:59.24]Oh shit, I did it.
[321:05.92]Come on!
[321:13.24]Do it!
[321:26.37]I had it too.
[321:27.90]Alright, I just tasted salt.
[321:30.70]Is the sweat like dripping down my face?
[321:38.49]No, it's not.
[321:39.05]I gotta go slower.
[321:47.66]Come on, I gotta get to the level.
[321:52.12]Itchy nose.
[322:20.65]I get it.
[322:21.27]Okay, I'm good.
[322:23.64]Social studies is in five minutes?
[322:30.16]Oh, right.
[322:30.62]Because we're in school.
[322:36.50]I gotta stick right in the middle.
[322:41.90]I gotta go down.
[322:47.88]That's what you gotta do.
[322:48.70]You gotta go down.
[322:58.92]Level 20.
[322:59.46]I'm ready.
[323:09.75]Just jump.
[323:10.69]Nice and easy.
[323:15.13]I got the bonus.
[323:15.69]That was easy.
[323:17.45]Through the teachers here.
[323:19.89]I don't give a shit.
[323:20.33]I'm going to fail this class anyways.
[323:21.45]Who cares?
[323:26.15]Maybe just run across it?
[323:29.00]Oh, I see.
[323:29.48]Aye, you gotta jump through the holes.
[323:35.67]Holy shit, you have to spin it around?
[323:43.34]Damn!
[323:43.86]Alright.
[324:08.82]Oh man, I gotta get that.
[324:09.94]Come on, 21.
[324:11.81]That's the blackjack number.
[324:12.69]I can do it.
[324:15.63]Got it.
[324:16.47]Alright, 22.
[324:16.95]Fuck.
[324:27.04]This is the last one.
[324:30.88]This is actually the last one.
[324:35.12]Damn, how do I do that?
[324:35.93]I gotta jump underneath it?
[324:43.05]Yeah, you gotta go underneath.
[324:51.51]No, you don't.
[325:00.90]Got it.
[325:01.94]Okay.
[325:02.34]23 is a scary number.
[325:03.26]It's like the Satan number.
[325:04.14]I can't... I've got 24.
[325:04.62]I can't end on the scary one.
[325:25.15]Alright, 24.
[325:25.71]I can't end on that one.
[325:57.81]25, that's like a good even one.
[325:59.67]He's doing an oblivion face.
[326:11.84]Alright, alright.
[326:12.46]Okay, I'm good, go.
[326:13.06]We're good, we're good.
[326:14.36]I did it!
[326:19.36]I won!
[326:20.28]I- okay, I won.
[326:23.20]What's the next one?
[326:32.67]What's another, like, really good one in the time we have remaining?
[326:37.27]Play Run 3.
[326:41.13]Run 3 is not as popular as Run 2.
[326:42.62]Let me see what we got.
[326:48.38]We've got B-Cubed.
[326:50.34]I feel like I can't do that one.
[326:53.26]Run 2.
[326:54.06]Bloxors.
[326:55.71]Awesome Tanks.
[326:56.71]Parking Fury.
[326:58.79]Papa's Sushiria.
[327:01.97]There is no game.
[327:05.79]What is there is no game?
[327:12.90]Block swords.
[327:13.54]Block, block, block.
[327:14.22]Alright, right, right.
[327:17.45]Flip the block over this way and over that way to get it to fall in the hole.
[327:21.15]You'll be flipping blocks in your sleep.
[327:25.25]Okay, let's do it.
[327:31.21]Make sure you can see what I'm doing here.
[327:35.10]Cool math.
[327:35.84]This needs to be moved, I think.
[327:37.66]Assembly, uh-huh.
[327:42.52]Block swords.
[327:46.91]Does it fit?
[328:02.15]Alright.
[328:03.35]So, the aim of the game is to get the block to fall into the square hole at the end of each stage.
[328:09.02]There are 33 stages.
[328:14.26]To move the block around, use left, right, up, and down arrow keys.
[328:16.75]Be careful not to fall off the edge.
[328:18.41]Well, here we go.
[328:21.26]Get the block to fall into the square hole at the end of each stage.
[328:24.90]There are 33 stages, alright.
[328:26.96]Move the block around the world.
[328:28.20]Use left and right, up and down.
[328:29.24]Be careful not to fall off the edge.
[328:31.18]The level will be restarted if you do.
[328:34.09]Oh, fuck.
[328:43.55]It's such a weird game to capture.
[328:51.33]Is that better?
[328:52.89]Bridges and switches are located in many levels.
[328:54.39]Switches are activated when they are pressed, right?
[328:56.45]You do not need to stay resting on the switch to keep it open.
[329:01.47]Heavy X-shaped ones and soft round ones.
[329:07.23]Soft switches are activated when any part of your block presses it.
[329:09.37]Hard switches are required.
[329:10.71]Much more pressure so your block must be standing on it to activate it, okay?
[329:15.18]When activated, each switch may behave differently.
[329:16.96]Some will swap the bridges from open to closed.
[329:18.80]Yeah, there's different stuff.
[329:21.28]Pump up the IQ for this one.
[329:25.36]Green or red colored squares will flash to indicate which bridges are being operated.
[329:31.82]Orange tiles are far more fragile than the rest of the land.
[329:34.70]If your block stands up vertically on an orange tile, the tile will give way and your block will fall.
[329:42.62]This parenthesis switch teleports your block to different locations, splitting it into two smaller blocks.
[329:53.42]I think this might be a little too much for me.
[329:56.14]It might be not too much for like an eighth grader, but it's too much for me.
[330:05.75]Okay.
[330:09.09]You can select different blocks.
[330:10.55]The passcode for each stage.
[330:15.14]It is located in the top right corner.
[330:16.46]So it's like Mega Man.
[330:21.05]Let's go.
[330:21.33]Alright, now that I can see the screen.
[331:34.37]Alright, I get it.
[332:17.49]He was joking funny man pretending to be stupid.
[332:20.19]He is enlightened.
[332:21.13]He's a... Stop!
[332:50.43]Oh, shit.
[332:50.93]Wait.
[333:00.52]Pretty good.
[333:04.66]Oh, shit.
[333:09.90]He was just pretending to be funny, man.
[333:11.76]He was pretending to be funny guy.
[333:16.64]What is that doing?
[334:00.09]No, I'm good.
[334:00.65]I'm good.
[334:00.93]I'm good.
[334:01.23]I'm good.
[334:01.51]I'm good.
[334:01.75]I'm good.
[334:02.01]Everything's fine.
[334:07.34]What do I think about this game?
[334:08.24]I think it's pretty sweet.
[334:11.18]I think it belongs in the top two video games on this site.
[334:20.51]Fuck, I did it and I went too far.
[335:36.68]I forgot I'm streaming.
[335:37.80]You're right.
[335:38.82]I'm streaming.
[335:41.82]Right.
[335:43.52]I'm not just playing cool math games alone.
[335:54.41]I'm stumped.
[335:55.23]I'm stumped on this one, I think, guys.
[335:58.97]They stumped me.
[336:01.25]Yeah, they stumped me.
[336:12.60]Alright, what's next?
[336:13.34]What's next on the, uh, what's next?
[336:16.30]Can you play something else?
[336:16.98]This game sucks.
[336:18.06]This game doesn't suck.
[336:18.74]I think it's pretty cool.
[336:20.68]What's next?
[336:21.24]Alright, we're going back.
[336:25.92]I never beat this one.
[336:27.12]So, yeah.
[336:31.98]Uh, Candy Jump Duck Life.
[336:34.87]Rob the Robber.
[336:40.69]Jack Smith.
[336:43.52]Papa's... Papa... A Papa game?
[336:47.72]Basketball Master 2.
[336:54.89]Huh.
[336:57.11]Papa's Pizzeria.
[336:59.49]What about Papa's Bakery?
[337:05.54]Papa's Bakery?
[337:17.69]No, no balloons.
[337:18.55]No balloons.
[337:20.53]Papa's Pizzeria.
[337:21.61]Why is that not popular?
[337:23.41]Was it up here?
[337:25.89]Is it not popular?
[337:32.03]It's not popular.
[337:37.79]Papa Louie.
[337:38.61]When Sundays attack...
[337:45.66]I'll just look for it.
[337:47.00]Pizza sucks.
[337:47.77]Bakery's okay.
[337:48.57]I'll do Papa's Bakery.
[337:52.49]Let's try it.
[338:03.88]Whoa, too loud.
[338:19.06]That's better.
[338:19.52]Alright, Papa's Bakery.
[338:29.45]Okay.
[338:32.07]Uh... After this one... Uh, this will probably be... This will probably be it.
[338:39.14]Because I had to start late.
[338:40.62]And we're going late.
[338:42.46]So, thankfully... The internet seems to have held up pretty well with this new VPN.
[338:46.60]Yeah.
[338:54.05]In five and a half hours, dropped 9,000 frames, which really is not that bad in the big picture.
[339:01.38]Okay.
[339:04.20]So, you know what?
[339:06.56]After this, we're going to do... We're going to do... Tomorrow, we're going to do DOS, but maybe we'll throw some of these in too.
[339:16.94]That would be fun.
[339:18.77]Just continue it.
[339:22.02]I really wanted to start earlier, and we just kind of got fucking screwed.
[339:26.20]So, we'll just do this for a little bit.
[339:29.35]Uh, new game.
[339:31.47]Tim.
[339:32.45]I'll be Tim.
[339:40.29]Uh, it's... Should I do this?
[339:47.47]No, did I?
[339:54.67]Alright, Papa's Bakery, day one.
[339:59.13]Welcome to Papa's Bakery.
[340:00.80]I did a video on one of these.
[340:04.08]I completely forgot about the video that I made.
[340:08.45]Customer's order, I take an order.
[340:09.63]Yeah, this is just cooked, served delicious, but different.
[340:17.03]Build station.
[340:17.57]We're gonna make a pie?
[340:19.83]Akira Akira Akari Akira's a movie.
[340:27.14]Uh, wants to have graham cracker crust for her pie.
[340:32.02]Drag this flavored crust into the tin.
[340:35.47]This pie needs to be completely filled with pecans.
[340:39.59]Oh, you got, you got the grunion.
[340:42.73]First choose the filling by clicking the pecan button.
[340:44.76]Yeah.
[340:48.12]You should add filling exactly how it shows on the ticket, all the way up.
[340:55.54]This is all pecans.
[340:56.72]This is gross.
[341:00.38]That's not pecan pie.
[341:01.34]Those are just pecans out of a bag.
[341:05.96]Akari wants a vented crust.
[341:10.52]Okay, vented crust.
[341:12.20]Drag the pie into the oven.
[341:14.43]The pie is burning.
[341:15.85]Wait until the bake meter reaches the arrow.
[341:19.38]Okay.
[341:24.66]Pecan pee pants.
[341:28.24]Done.
[341:28.56]Take it up.

[341:40.91]Okay.
[341:44.83]How do I do it?
[341:47.35]Try to cover the whole pie with this drizzle.
[341:53.70]Uh... Did I do it?
[341:56.46]Okay... It wants eight banana slices placed in the outer ring of the pie.
[342:05.73]Okay.
[342:12.75]Oh, I'm sorry!
[342:17.22]I couldn't mute.
[342:17.76]There's no way.
[342:24.13]Drag this ticket's order onto the ticket holder to deliver it.
[342:30.81]Look good!

[345:21.39]Am I wagering tickets or something?
[345:26.75]What does this mean?
[345:34.08]I don't get it.
[345:36.16]Can we play again?
[345:36.70]Oh, I don't want to do it again.
[345:38.96]Just lose.

[346:09.56]Ooh, we got Fudge, too.
[346:11.88]This is looking pretty cool.
[346:18.44]Alright, this one I'm gonna just dump a bunch of shit in and just do, like, the funny YouTube joke.
[346:24.03]I want Fudge.
[346:29.63]Okay.
[346:38.63]Can I not do the funny YouTuber joke?
[346:43.43]Or do I just have to make a pie?
[346:48.97]Shit, I can't.
[346:51.31]I thought I was going to be able to start dropping stuff.
[346:53.60]This is going to take a long time.
[347:03.10]Cherry pie, apple pie, crunchies on it.
[347:07.00]You got it.
[347:14.66]Oops.
[347:15.10]How do I change that?
[347:15.90]How do I... It's the same color.
[347:28.28]He won't even notice.
[347:34.55]It's in between.
[347:35.37]It's in the middle.
[347:35.91]You won't even know.
[347:36.49]They'll just scoop together.
[347:39.71]It's not burning.
[347:40.53]Look.

[349:00.53]Alright, this one is... Uh... Okay, I'll write my name.
[349:12.20]Okay.
[349:20.73]And then, whipped cream.
[349:22.05]Oops.
[349:31.38]I don't think baristas write their own names on lattes.
[349:33.82]No, I'm talking about when you go inside with the milk, and you'd make like a little design.
[349:38.30]Okay, this one, what does it want?
[349:43.41]What does this one want me to do?
[349:44.47]Alright, I might as well do Crunch Coat.
[349:46.49]A little Crunch Coat thing.
[349:48.05]Crunchies.
[349:53.79]Okay.
[349:56.84]That's it.
[350:03.32]That was loud.
[350:05.56]Do you hear that?
[350:11.24]Go to the... Oh, shit, that's right.
[350:12.48]There's customers here.
[350:15.32]Closers are very picky about their food.
[350:16.82]They will be tougher when grading their orders.
[350:20.12]This guy's a closer.
[350:23.22]Okay, bake station.
[350:24.04]Okay, um... Build.
[350:26.34]Let's do... It's this crust right here.
[350:28.56]Chocolate.
[350:30.31]And then...
[350:32.62]Double pecan.
[350:34.12]Back to chocolate.
[350:35.92]This one is... He wants this one.
[350:40.40]Throw that in the oven.
[350:43.12]Anybody else?
[350:44.32]No.
[350:45.98]Uh-oh.
[350:49.44]She's getting angry.
[350:57.24]That one sounds pretty good.
[350:59.70]Take out the pecans and you got me on board.
[351:06.46]Nobody else?
[351:07.42]Alright, we're closed, right.
[351:10.20]Is the kangaroo alright?
[351:12.50]He's kind of breathing kind of heavy.
[351:19.85]More toppings?
[351:25.23]Stop saying pecan.
[351:27.42]I'm sorry.
[351:29.10]Pecan.
[351:29.26]Pecan.
[351:43.88]What does that mean?
[351:45.64]Uh... No, this is the wrong ticket.
[351:48.03]Get out of my way.
[351:49.85]Get out of the way.
[351:50.39]Alright, um... You want cherry sauce on this.
[351:59.67]And then banana slices?
[352:00.95]Where's the banana?
[352:05.02]Oh, down here.
[352:14.85]And then cherries.
[352:35.50]She likes it!
[352:39.32]Oh, fuck!
[352:40.42]His pie's burning.
[352:44.80]Alright, you want whipped cream.
[352:47.82]And what is that?
[352:49.96]Whipped cream.
[352:59.39]No, I gotta do it around the whole thing.
[353:28.16]Alright, so I want drops in the inner ring and the center of the pie.
[353:32.14]Put one in the center and space the rest of them out in the inner ring.
[353:41.30]How many?
[353:41.64]Okay, and then you want peanuts around the outer ring.
[353:58.42]Whatever.
[353:58.92]Just go.
[353:59.30]Take it.
[354:04.15]D minus.
[354:13.87]And thanks for watching the stream, everybody.
[354:15.49]That was a fun one tonight.
[354:19.07]Actually, I didn't have a good time.
[354:19.95]We were just kind of chilling and shooting the shit.
[354:21.75]It's been fun.
[354:30.96]It's getting late.
[354:32.68]We're approaching somewhere around midnight Pacific.
[354:37.00]Had to start late, so... Sorry that we had to start so late, but the internet was horrible, but... I'm thinking that this VPN may have helped.
[354:49.67]Six hours, 93... Less than 10,000 drop frames in six hours is actually pretty good.
[354:57.55]Let's see what happens tomorrow.
[355:06.00]Because I gotta do a test for at least a few days.
[355:09.28]Because we've seen this internet be perfect.
[355:12.51]And then it's been... Oh, it dropped 30,000 frames.
[355:17.13]We'll see how it goes.
[355:19.95]But I had a lot of fun.
[355:21.64]I like to do this.
[355:22.44]I like to just kind of hang out and talk shit and play random stuff and just be on cam.
[355:27.54]But it doesn't happen that often.
[355:28.42]It doesn't happen that often.
[355:32.30]Can't wait to not see half the carnival stream because of this.
[355:35.10]Well, lucky for all of us, the carnival stream is not happening in Las Vegas.
[355:41.10]Like here.
[355:42.72]I'm going to be on location for that.
[355:45.39]So it's not happening here in Vegas.
[355:51.59]No.
[355:54.49]But that's all you need to know.
[355:58.29]Speak of the devil.
[355:59.95]Just dropped a frame right there.
[356:06.28]On location with worse internet.
[356:07.76]Now that would be sad.
[356:10.22]I don't think that's going to happen.
[356:13.22]It's not even going to be in the state of Nevada.
[356:16.18]It's across the country, actually.
[356:20.38]What happens now?
[356:21.24]Now we wind down a little.
[356:24.50]We say goodnight.
[356:26.28]We turn off the screen.
[356:28.76]So again, tomorrow we're going to do DOS.
[356:33.69]Join me for DOS tomorrow.
[356:35.19]There's at least a few of them that I think would be fun to do.
[356:44.80]Sorry we had to start at like 5.30 Pacific tonight.
[356:48.48]It was not my intention.
[356:56.18]And I probably lost some of the subs from six or seven hours ago.
[357:01.86]I'm sorry about that.
[357:03.60]When the stream gets killed like that, I lose subs.
[357:06.68]But, uh, we'll try again tomorrow.
[357:13.62]DOS games.
[357:17.09]And let's go back to earlier.
[357:18.01]What is a Jerma smile?
[357:27.53]Well, that's terrifying.
[357:32.36]But thank you to Freudian Weapon for the 250.
[357:36.81]Sorry for almost spoiling Redacted.
[357:40.17]I did not get the memo.
[357:41.03]If it makes you feel better, I do feel bad about it.
[357:42.81]So could you please call off your small battalion of rats?
[357:46.17]I haven't actually seen one yet, but I know they're there.
[357:49.71]MonkaS.
[357:54.56]People unsubscribe over that.
[357:56.12]No, no, no, no.
[357:56.72]I mean... I don't have... I do credits at the end of the stream.
[358:02.80]They scroll up.
[358:04.06]And when a stream gets dropped to zero and I have to stop, there's new credits that are made.
[358:11.37]Because it only takes the subs that come through for that VOD, for that broadcast.
[358:17.92]Not the one from earlier.
[358:19.80]So every time a new VOD is created or I drop to zero, the subs kind of start at zero again.
[358:25.58]It's annoying, but it happens.
[358:28.56]No, I don't mean like people are unsubscribing over that.
[358:34.30]No, just the plug-in doesn't really work so well.
[358:39.50]But, I don't know, Freudian, what are you talking about here?
[358:45.46]What, spoiler for what?
[358:48.88]Jaredun, thanks for the ten dollars and sixty cents.
[358:53.34]Jaredun also gave a hundred fucking dollars.
[358:56.92]And they say, how do I subscribe?
[359:00.44]And there should be a button down there.
[359:06.86]But regardless, you have subscribed a shitload of times already.
[359:12.85]By giving me like a hundred and fucking plus dollars.
[359:18.14]So I don't worry about that.
[359:22.34]Thank you.
[359:22.72]There was a string of like three or four hundred bucks in a row here earlier.
[359:30.10]We got them all, but thank you guys so much.
[359:35.44]The amount of money that comes in for sometimes is just fucking outrageous.
[359:39.64]I can't even comprehend it.
[359:43.11]You guys are too much.
[359:44.35]Thank you.
[359:48.75]We also had $10 come in from Jerma's Nuts.
[359:52.31]Say my name, coward.
[359:54.21]I said your name last night, too.
[359:59.23]I said it last night.
[360:08.02]But, thank you.
[360:09.36]I do appreciate it.
[360:11.02]Hey, BusterBoy, thanks for the $3, BusterBoy.
[360:16.08]Don't forget, you promised to lip-sync the entirety of Mambo No.
[360:19.08]5.
[360:19.80]Jerma lied about lip-syncing Mambo No.
[360:21.74]5.
[360:21.86]I'm sure it's already been created.
[360:24.78]DrinkingSkills came in with five community subs right now.
[360:28.08]Thank you.
[360:30.70]Thank you, DrinkingSkills.
[360:31.49]Appreciate it.
[360:35.69]I did it.
[360:36.11]I did it yesterday.
[360:36.79]There's a clip of me lip-syncing the first, like, 12... 25 seconds.
[360:49.12]There's only one bit message that you can't see, and it's $5.37 from Bingus Tingle that said, Jerma, when are you gonna play Ed, Edd, and Eddy online?
[361:02.59]Is this the deepfake one?
[361:03.37]Let's see.
[361:11.53]Yeah, this is not even real.
[361:12.19]This is a deepfake.
[361:12.85]You're right.
[361:34.80]See, people put me in situations, they deepfake me.
[361:38.11]You can hear it in the distance.
[361:43.72]But thank you, BustedBoy, for the three bucks.
[361:50.40]Thank you to StiffFunkyChicken for the three bucks.
[361:54.08]I don't know if you're in the mood for watching videos this stream, but I made some pretty short ones.
[361:57.42]No links in chat, so you can find the three vids on YouTube under this username.
[362:02.24]Uh, hold the videos.
[362:04.22]Because we're going to do a... I'm going to do it.
[362:08.42]We're going to do a once a month.
[362:10.48]A once every... Probably to keep... Make sure that, like, clips and videos are relevant.
[362:14.93]And art is relevant.
[362:16.21]We'll probably do it once every couple weeks.
[362:19.03]A video art community segment.
[362:27.80]I've decided it's probably a good idea.
[362:29.52]But I want to do it more than once a month.
[362:33.92]Because once you do it... Stuff like... Like Mambo number five stuff would not necessarily be relevant in like a month.
[362:44.33]Right?
[362:44.93]So if somebody were to do something... Every like two or three weeks.
[362:51.01]I think sounds pretty good.
[362:55.31]I like that idea.
[362:59.32]But hold on to some of that stuff.
[363:00.58]We'll have an avenue for that eventually here.
[363:04.69]Over the coming few weeks, I think.
[363:06.25]A couple weeks, probably.
[363:08.49]But I do appreciate anything that you make.
[363:10.18]You guys are really fucking talented.
[363:18.00]But thank you.
[363:19.28]Thank you, Dork Cube, for the 250.
[363:20.66]This candy tier list is inherently flawed because it doesn't include all the types of M&Ms.
[363:25.62]I might agree that plain M&Ms are F or D tier, but coffee nut M&Ms, A tier.
[363:31.58]Pretzel M&Ms, S tier.
[363:33.88]Also, all this candy talk is reminding me of when my cadets group, it's the knockoff Boy Scouts, would go to the Memorial Day Parade and shoot candy with a candy catapult.
[363:45.62]Like, launch it out like a t-shirt.
[363:56.12]Walmart Boy Scouts.
[364:00.07]A candy catapult.
[364:05.27]It's so ridiculous.
[364:18.08]M&Ms are worthy of a B.
[364:20.76]Hold up, wait, you're just giving candy away for free?
[364:28.41]Free candy.
[364:29.89]How could you not like it?
[364:32.91]Pretzel M&Ms are amazing.
[364:34.33]So are peanut butter M&Ms.
[364:35.79]But they don't really... They weren't there.
[364:39.35]I agree with you.
[364:41.80]Wiki this, thanks for the five bucks.
[364:43.18]Fun fact, Sour Patch Kids are S+.
[364:48.06]Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.
[364:50.16]In my opinion.
[364:54.76]I mean, that's a fun fact.
[365:03.73]Fun fact is wrong.
[365:06.89]Thank you, Gnarly, for the three bucks.
[365:08.43]When will Jerma's Psycho be an actual emote?
[365:10.89]I don't know.
[365:12.61]Maybe down the road.
[365:15.25]Uh, Niall Orion.
[365:16.71]Orion, thanks for the three dollars.
[365:18.83]The I gotta go meme is my favorite.
[365:20.93]I use it in real life and it still gets me.
[365:27.54]I gotta get out of here.
[365:30.56]He'll look into it, yeah.
[365:34.54]Uh, Niall Orion again, thanks for the five dollars on top of your three dollars.
[365:37.38]You say Jerma Bald won't last when in reality it will only become more relevant in time.
[365:44.13]Yeah.
[365:46.94]That's true.
[365:49.34]Can't go backwards on that one.
[365:51.32]We can only go forwards.
[365:57.03]Invader Z, thanks for the $10, Invader Z. Or Invaders.
[366:02.21]Invaders.
[366:02.67]Z.
[366:08.81]Jerma, you're always making me laugh and making my days and nights brighter.
[366:11.51]Thank you for that.
[366:12.47]I don't have much to offer, but I want to support your streams, and I'm happy to be a subscriber.
[366:17.15]Also, I'm totally going to make a Jerma Psycho emote.
[366:25.52]Yeah, if you... I'm sure people will come up with some really wild shit for that.
[366:31.94]But thank you for the $10, Invaders.
[366:36.10]Happy to hang out here.
[366:39.05]I'm just glad you're enjoying the streams.
[366:43.08]It means a lot.
[366:44.20]Thank you for the $10.
[366:47.78]We also had $10 again from GTS223.
[366:55.10]This list is junk.
[366:56.38]Why is Zynga above King?
[367:02.19]What is this?
[367:06.15]Why is Zynga above King?
[367:09.12]I mean, they're both down there.
[367:10.04]But thank you, GTS.
[367:15.92]Oh, that link of me with the Glue Man shirt on.
[367:20.16]That's not even the same image.
[367:26.02]But thank you, GTS.
[367:27.12]Thank you to... Thank you to Jeremy... Jeremy X. Morris?
[367:38.22]I don't know what your name is, but thank you for the $10.
[367:39.74]Uh, well...
[368:10.04]We're probably not going to do another green screen movie night.
[368:14.84]What'll probably end up happening is all those other submissions or all those other things that... Did I cut out?
[368:22.96]No, I think I'm good.
[368:27.20]It would be part of the community night.
[368:29.48]So we wouldn't do a, oh, yeah, here's the green screen movie night.
[368:32.58]It would just be lumped in with, here's the video portion of the community night.
[368:43.68]Makes sense, I think.
[368:46.78]But thank you for the $10, and hold on to it.
[368:50.18]There'll be an avenue for it soon.
[368:56.66]Thank you to Apple Shift for the $2.50.
[368:59.60]They say, hey man, my name's Gwen.
[369:00.94]I just got into you a week or so ago and I've been watching all your classics for the first time.
[369:05.82]I'm loving them and I wanted to show you my drawing I did of you versus Glue Man.
[369:10.54]I hope you like it.
[369:11.76]Thank you for being you.
[369:12.96]Here's a link to it.
[369:13.78]Okay.
[369:15.96]Well, welcome.
[369:18.46]Thanks for stopping by.
[369:19.70]Welcome to the channel.
[369:20.38]Alright, this is fucking pretty good.
[369:25.84]Let's put it on screen.
[369:35.62]This is... Jacked Me.
[369:38.99]Versus Gloom Man.
[369:39.63]This is original.
[369:40.69]This is an original!
[369:42.73]Look at this.
[369:45.47]That's from the first ever Jerma Rumble, right?
[369:51.64]God, if I was only that big still.
[369:54.20]If I could only be that big.
[369:59.88]Too bad.
[370:03.28]It's alright.
[370:06.00]That's fantastic, though.
[370:08.57]Welcome to the community.
[370:09.55]Welcome to the channel.
[370:10.67]I'm not sure where you came from, or if just randomly somebody showed you the channel, or from another streamer or something, but welcome.
[370:18.46]Always happy to bring in new people, for sure.
[370:22.68]Thank you so much for the art.
[370:23.58]It's fucking awesome.
[370:25.00]And that was Apple Shift.
[370:26.78]Thank you.
[370:28.72]This is good shit.
[370:34.58]I love the glue, man.
[370:38.58]She made you tall.
[370:43.54]I am tall.
[370:46.32]I am tall.
[370:50.32]And I'm still young.
[370:51.70]You're still young.
[370:52.54]Oh my god.
[370:55.34]Yeah, but I know.
[370:56.35]But I'm getting older.
[370:59.53]You know they call 40 over the hill, right?
[371:04.28]I'm closer to 40 than I am 21.
[371:05.80]25 even.
[371:10.54]Closer to 40 than 25.
[371:11.86]I'm getting there.
[371:13.14]It's gonna happen sooner than I think.
[371:14.41]I gotta hold on to my youth.
[371:19.93]But let's show the credits.
[371:23.67]I will be live tomorrow.
[371:24.65]We'll do some DOS games.
[371:25.59]Hopefully we have a similar internet experience where it can actually work.
[371:32.60]I hope this VPN really did do something.
[371:34.44]Because it seems like it might be a little bit better than it was yesterday.
[371:37.24]In fact, it is.
[371:37.76]I mean, clearly.
[371:40.08]Thank you to all the subs.
[371:41.42]Everybody that gave community subs.
[371:44.29]Also, the fax machine gave five community subs earlier, too.
[371:47.71]And I may have missed it.
[371:52.61]You know, right when I start talking about it.
[371:53.91]I mean, right when you start to talk about it.
[372:01.53]That was bad.
[372:02.09]Are we done?
[372:03.75]Are we dead?
[372:04.33]I think I'm off.
[372:10.35]I think it's, like, actually shut off.
[372:12.85]Holy shit.
[372:16.95]Yeah, I, like, turned off.
[372:25.75]That was pretty wild.
[372:29.25]The fax machine gave five community subs earlier, is what I wanted to say.
[372:33.83]Thankfully that kind of happened right at the very end.
[372:38.38]But thank you everybody.
[372:39.20]Yeah, that went right absolutely to zero.
[372:44.36]Better than yesterday though.
[372:46.68]The stream yesterday was seven hours and 40 minutes.
[372:50.39]I think I dropped like 26,000 frames.
[372:53.43]This stream was six hours and it's 11,000 drop frames.
[373:02.01]so uh better but not great better I'm just gonna keep using the vpn and see what happens but uh we have a couple more bits to do we have um on top of the five community subs right after that was uh mac jarlo for the four dollars here Jerma want to thank you for your TF2 videos they're the reason why I started playing
[373:32.00]Yeah, I'm... Thanks for watching the TF2 videos, because that's where I started.
[373:39.74]Thank you.
[373:42.05]Without the TF2 content, I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing right now.
