[00:00.72]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:02.26]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary on the eve of the new... I already screwed that up.
[00:10.05]On New Year's Eve, this is a gameplay commentary.
[00:12.65]Gonna be using the Flogger.
[00:14.59]That's what I like to call the new Pyro Gun.
[00:16.37]The Flogistinator, the Manmelter, and the Powerjack.
[00:20.65]playing on capture the flag double cross which in my opinion is sort of just a reverse two fort you got the sewers on the either sides you have the sniper roost the bridge in the middle it's just whenever I play on double cross I feel like I'm on two for it
[00:35.30]But more importantly, let's talk about the New Year celebration and my plans tonight, and it involves a lot of you guys.
[00:42.97]So hear me out for a second.
[00:44.53]Tonight, obviously, I'm going to be going out to probably a bar or a club, get a couple of drinks with me, have some fun, go out with some friends I haven't seen in a while, come back home, and after about maybe 12 or 1 o'clock in the morning, drumroll please...
[01:00.87]I'm gonna be doing a live stream the first live stream since like October so hopefully you guys can show up to that I know that's going to be pretty late and I'm gonna be pretty drunk so act it could get interesting but I'm I apologize in advance if you're from Europe or somewhere in eastern Asia
[01:18.00]It's gonna be, like, 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning for you, and a lot of you aren't gonna be awake, so I'm sorry, but it will be recorded.
[01:25.03]All the live streams on Twitch get recorded, so you will be able to watch it if you really want to later the next day.
[01:30.43]Now, I'm not gonna get, like, trashed and just get on the mic and be like,
[01:38.68]Like, that's not gonna happen.
[01:40.02]I'll probably be a little bit inebriated, so I might say some goofy things, but I'm not gonna be like crazy, so don't worry.
[01:46.39]I'm gonna put a YouTube bulletin out the second I start streaming, and I'm gonna put it obviously on the various social networking sites like Twitter, Facebook, and my Steam group, so if you are connected to me somehow, you will know when I'm doing it.
[02:00.21]So now that that's out of the way, let's talk about the Phlogistinator for a second.
[02:04.46]And oh my god, this is a powerful, powerful weapon.
[02:09.24]And if it doesn't get nerfed, I will be so shocked.
[02:12.66]It's just crazy.
[02:13.34]This gun is insane.
[02:15.50]Definitely expect a damage nerf of something like 10 or 15%.
[02:18.91]If they don't do that, they're probably going to remove the crits or turn it into mini crits, kind of like the Soda Popper.
[02:25.73]In its state right now, the way it is right now...
[02:28.61]This thing is way too powerful.
[02:30.56]I have seen Phlogistinator Pyros clear an entire server because they're just doing so well with it.
[02:36.88]But I'm not going to sit here and not going to complain about it.
[02:38.78]I'm not one typically to complain about weapons or items.
[02:41.72]I think they're all fun.
[02:42.52]I think they're all here for a reason.
[02:44.26]So I think it just needs a little bit of a tweak here or there, something a little bit different.
[02:47.86]But it's definitely a whole lot of fun, so before all that happens, get your hands on it and play with it.
[02:52.83]That's going to be the end of this gameplay.
[02:54.44]Got a top frag in this one, but I want to show you something else really important.
[02:58.64]It's all about capping flags and running flags as a floggy pyro.
[03:02.90]What you can actually do is you can right click.
[03:05.31]Right clicking activates the crits and the health increase.
[03:08.39]You can do this with the flag on your back.
[03:10.85]It doesn't force drop it, it doesn't cancel out the animation or something.
[03:14.33]If you see a room full of enemies coming at you and you have the flag, just right click and mow them all down.
[03:19.86]And even if you're getting shot at, let's say you're getting shot at and you're low on health and you're almost to the exit, you can almost get there, right click and fill your health up again.
[03:27.72]This makes the Pyro a very, very good flag runner.
[03:32.18]And real quick, I want to talk about the Manmelter, this thing right here.
[03:36.14]Put out the Medic and then crit the Scout, filling up my oomph meter.
[03:40.49]I love this weapon because it forces you to be a team player.
[03:43.63]Even if you don't want to, it's in your best interest to put somebody out.
[03:48.09]The only real downside of this weapon is the fact that you have to put somebody out to get a crit.
[03:52.93]I'm so used to just shooting people and smashing them with the flare gun and critting them if they're on fire.
[03:57.93]You can't do that anymore.
[03:59.15]You kind of have to rethink how you play flare gun pyro.
[04:02.26]So here we go.
[04:03.12]If we were in a courtroom right now, this would be exhibit A on why this is a crazy flag-running weapon.
[04:09.48]I kill this entire room of people.
[04:11.84]If I did not have this item equipped, I probably wouldn't have gotten past the first person, let alone the entire room full of people.
[04:19.58]About to get the final cap right here.
[04:21.75]I know you guys didn't get to see a whole lot of this particular gameplay, but I did okay.
[04:25.73]It was very long.
[04:26.83]I think it was 27 points, and the last one was 18, but this one went on for a whole lot longer, and I didn't really do as well.
[04:33.94]But I still wanted to show you that flag cap, because, of course, I wanted to bring up a couple of things about it.
[04:38.78]That is going to be the end of the video, though.
[04:40.68]Thank you so much for watching.
[04:42.18]I hopefully will see some of you guys tonight.
[04:44.38]Stay tuned to my Twitter, Facebook, Steam group, and I'll put a YouTube bulletin out.
[04:49.47]And if I don't happen to see you, then have a fantastic New Year.
[04:52.59]Happy New Year, everybody.
[04:54.69]See you all next time.
[04:56.01]Take care, everybody.
