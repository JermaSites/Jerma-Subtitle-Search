[ve:61.1.100]

[00:26.17]And welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, and various first special.
[00:30.30]You know what we do here?
[00:31.10]Tony Toasty Tostino rolls.
[00:34.20]Congratulations, you were the first person to write something as the stream started and you get a digital cookie.
[00:41.53]Here it is.
[00:43.39]Hey, thank you.
[00:50.79]Hey, do you still stream?
[00:53.25]Alright, if that person wrote that in offline chat, that's really funny.
[00:57.14]Because I just scared the shit out of him.
[00:59.50]Imagine being like, oh, is he retired?
[01:01.82]He kind of stopped streaming, didn't he?
[01:03.02]Yeah, he did.
[01:03.66]He's kind of back doing some stuff.
[01:05.56]Is he still doing anything?
[01:06.50]And then I just appear in front of you.
[01:15.91]Yeah, I said I wasn't going to stream for like three or four days.
[01:19.32]The lie detector test determined that that was a lie.
[01:25.12]Yeah, that was a lie.
[01:28.91]Why do you have such a deep voice?
[01:30.35]This is when, I told you, this is the milk voice.
[01:32.82]This is the morning.
[01:35.12]This is when I don't talk for a long time.
[01:39.17]I come out here and I have this radio voice.
[01:42.76]I should do a morning show.
[01:45.38]You know what I'm saying?
[01:47.29]If I streamed from 9, 10 o'clock in the morning till 2, 3 o'clock in the afternoon, this is what you would get.
[01:54.98]You would hear this on a regular basis instead of what you get normally, which is a kind of a dry, worn down way of speaking.
[02:06.60]It's like this for an hour and then it just goes away.
[02:09.26]I need to do one hour streams from 9 a.m.
[02:12.01]to... I need to have the morning show, the morning slot routine.
[02:18.07]I like the high-pitched soy voice better.
[02:20.45]Okay, so this, look at the range that I have here.
[02:23.63]Let's just go over the range.
[02:25.50]You got this.
[02:27.62]Elmo.
[02:29.66]Can you imagine a guy like this?
[02:31.66]Listen to me speaking right now.
[02:33.95]Yeah, we got the traffic report coming in here.
[02:35.83]Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to take a quick look at the car in front of you.
[02:40.23]It could be slow.
[02:41.09]Imagine that guy having an Elmo laugh.
[02:44.48]Like, that doesn't make any sense.
[02:48.95]It's weird.
[02:50.25]I agree.
[02:50.85]It's weird.
[02:59.48]You know, I had a 3DO in 1996.
[03:01.22]My dad got it in a drug deal.
[03:03.86]Were there drugs in the 3DO?
[03:06.13]I don't understand.
[03:08.99]Okay, what was that?
[03:09.75]Like, hey, we meet in a parking lot and I'm selling you a 3DO.
[03:12.19]Oh, cool.
[03:13.27]The 3DO.
[03:14.03]And you open up the CD tray and there's cocaine in there.
[03:16.56]Was that what you did?
[03:17.22]It was like a way to hide the drugs?
[03:26.13]Do you stream when I can't watch on purpose?
[03:30.59]When can you watch?
[03:32.55]Because I usually start sometimes at like 10 a.m.
[03:35.64]Pacific, noon Pacific, 2 Pacific, 4 Pacific.
[03:39.36]What time works for you?
[03:42.60]Because I stream sometimes at like every time.
[03:50.21]As an Australian chatterer,
[03:53.48]Hey, Megabonk just came out.
[03:55.05]I'm so glad you brought that up because I might play that today.
[03:58.44]Depends on how long this takes.
[04:01.42]But yeah, I'm just chilling today.
[04:03.67]Why am I streaming a day later when I said I wasn't going to?
[04:09.12]As I said, hey, I'll stream on like Thursday.
[04:11.23]We might do some more Horseman stuff on Thursday.
[04:14.35]And if I don't stream on Wednesday, then I'm going to stream on Thursday and I'm going to tell you, oh, we'll do this stuff like Sunday.
[04:20.61]And we all know the rule here.
[04:22.76]There's a very, very strict, unwritten, but very strict, unwritten rule.
[04:27.32]If I play a game and you don't see it for two weeks, you will never see it ever again.
[04:33.67]Ever.
[04:35.61]That's kind of how it works here.
[04:37.98]So, to avoid that, I want to finish Dragon Lore.
[04:43.31]I think we were really into it a few days ago.
[04:44.69]I thought it was really funny.
[04:45.51]I thought it was a really interesting, weird game.
[04:48.72]This is the last time I'm going to stream Dragon Lore, so if we don't finish it, then it's over.
[04:57.65]Waterpark Sim is also there, but to be fair, I have streamed Waterpark Sim like four or five times.
[05:03.22]And I don't know if there's technically an end to Waterpark Sim.
[05:06.87]I mean, I guess there is.
[05:08.61]Get to five stars and have the best park in the world or something, but... I see Waterpark Sim as more of an open simulation, kind of like a rollercoaster tycoon experience.
[05:21.61]You're like a third of the way done with Dragon Lore?
[05:25.36]Okay, well, we're going to lock in.
[05:27.74]We're going to lock in and we're going to get this done.
[05:31.37]What about Sorcery?
[05:32.99]Well, Sorcery has broken the two-week period by about... 16 months.
[05:44.95]But, I just about like Freeman.
[05:47.57]And here we are.
[05:48.49]We can play Dragonlord.
[05:51.68]I gotta remember where we were.
[05:52.84]I think I'm in the right spot.
[06:00.63]What about Deltarune?
[06:03.60]Hold on.
[06:04.91]Let me get my stack of papers and shuffle them to make sure I got the script correct.
[06:09.80]Here we go.
[06:11.82]Okay.
[06:14.03]Let me read this again.
[06:15.49]I can put my glasses on.
[06:17.96]I have no plans to stream Deltarune.
[06:21.07]Deltarune is something that I would like to do potentially off-stream, but I need to catch up with Deltarune... Yeah, there's a typo there.
[06:28.23]Chapters 1 and 2 first.
[06:31.24]I think it's important that I catch up with the game before I do the next episodes, but I also don't think I'm going to be streaming the game as I think I would like to experience it on my own instead.
[06:42.45]That's what was written, and that's what I've said a few times on stream.
[06:44.77]Let's make sure I've lost papers again and get it over here.
[06:48.93]And I'll read that in like a week when somebody asks again.
[06:53.52]Alright, are we ready?
[06:58.97]Did you use chat GPT to make that up?
[07:01.92]That was... No.
[07:06.59]P-R-A-N-D.
[07:10.51]Why do you fail me so often?
[07:13.96]Listen to me.
[07:15.22]When you got a voice like this for an hour, you start giving direction.
[07:19.82]You start giving... This is like the I'm not fucking around today voice.
[07:25.29]In an hour when it's gone and I'm back to being like, I don't know what to do.
[07:29.73]Then we can talk.
[07:30.57]But right now, you sit down and you shut the fuck up.
[07:33.92]You understand?
[07:39.42]Let's go.
[07:48.11]Somebody said, Jesus dude, relax.
[07:51.47]That was incredibly relaxed.
[07:53.20]That was like a really relaxed way to say that.
[07:56.78]Hope you get an ingrown fingernail.
[07:58.30]I already have one.
[07:59.22]What did you do to me?
[08:00.78]What did you just do?
[08:02.68]That happened like 10 minutes ago.
[08:05.75]I actually do have one on my index finger.
[08:11.59]Ban that witch for an hour, okay?
[08:17.39]Alright, welcome.
[08:18.01]Good morning.
[08:20.87]I think there's somewhere else I could go in here.
[08:24.92]Uncle Jerma told me to shut up.
[08:28.00]Don't tell on me.
[08:29.71]You're going to tattletale on me.
[08:33.09]There was more stuff I could do in here.
[08:34.69]This place is a complete mess, so I don't know.
[08:38.60]This place was the maze, but I have been told that there's more things in here.
[08:43.71]And yes, I've been cheating profusely.
[08:47.46]But I'm going to refrain from cheating a little bit today.
[08:49.64]But I, whatever.
[08:50.74]I'm just playing for fun.
[08:56.45]It is a one pixel, click the right spot, 1990s FMV type game, guys.
[09:12.91]Okay, I definitely need a bowl.
[09:18.93]How did I end up back here again?
[09:22.34]We're going to go back to the fork in the road.
[09:28.58]That's the entrance.
[09:31.39]No, that's the entrance.
[09:32.29]Shit.
[09:32.93]We're going to go this way.
[09:36.64]Okay.
[09:36.76]Another... So this is... We'll stay in this side here.
[09:39.86]We'll try right.
[09:42.52]Shit.
[09:44.95]Okay, this is right, right.
[09:46.45]We're going to go right, right, right.
[09:49.63]We saw this person.
[09:54.62]They wanted violence.
[09:58.55]So let's try the other side.
[09:59.99]Oh no, where would I come from?
[10:06.20]OK, this is new.
[10:07.06]This is new.
[10:09.33]How's the audio?
[10:09.85]We good?
[10:20.59]That looks like an upside down bucket to me.
[10:23.96]Okay, it is a bucket.
[10:26.79]Okay, now I get the water.
[10:28.17]I have so much stupid shit in my inventory.
[10:31.32]What do I do with all this?
[10:34.72]But what if I need it at one point?
[10:36.44]What if I need the three rockets and the rocket launcher to not shoot it until I get to Nemesis?
[10:41.96]And then just miss two of the rockets?
[10:44.07]And I cause so much pain and suffering in my inventory for 12 hours of gameplay to miss three shots at the end of the game.
[10:51.83]What do I wish I get rid of?
[10:53.95]The bucket is really important.
[10:57.66]I mean, I have to get the water.
[11:00.06]Should I keep the walking stick?
[11:01.36]I feel like this is in the cutscenes.
[11:02.48]It's important to me.
[11:05.38]Which one of these weapons just sucks that I don't care about?
[11:13.79]I'm going to get rid of this.
[11:16.27]Yeah.
[11:17.11]I'm getting rid of this.
[11:19.89]And the skull.
[11:22.71]What about the bone?
[11:23.56]I've had the bone since the beginning of the game.
[11:25.44]It's like the gnome from Left 4 Dead.
[11:27.52]It has to take the whole journey with me.
[11:31.06]Can I throw it?
[11:37.71]I can't get rid of this.
[11:39.81]Isn't it?
[11:40.11]Right click was throw it.
[11:47.02]Get rid of the bone.
[11:47.86]Alright, if this bone is required for anything later in the game, I just want to make sure you all know that you told me to get rid of it.
[11:56.80]Why can't?
[11:57.40]Why can't I throw this away?
[11:58.56]Alright, right click does not work.
[12:03.99]How do I drop an item?
[12:07.63]Don't O7 me on this.
[12:18.24]O7.
[12:19.52]Oh, that's a Left 4 Dead reference?
[12:20.75]He really is 40.
[12:22.79]I can't get rid of any items.
[12:24.11]I just have to carry it with me.
[12:25.07]Alright, whatever.
[12:26.99]Anything else in here that I can take?
[12:27.95]I think that's all I can do.
[12:35.00]You could have used the bone at one of the dogs in the first level of the game.
[12:39.53]Okay, well then I'll get rid of it.
[12:40.87]I'll get rid of it.
[12:44.76]I just have a different cursor now.
[12:46.02]That's fine.
[12:48.32]Left 4 Dead was 40 years ago.
[12:50.61]Alright, now I'm going to get the water.
[12:58.26]Can I just, like, get rid of this?
[12:59.24]I don't want to... Okay.
[13:02.18]Left 4 Dead 2 was 2009.
[13:10.21]Yeah.
[13:13.00]Oh, wait.
[13:16.26]He wants a bone.
[13:18.29]Oh, wait.
[13:21.69]He was making fun of me for holding the bone.
[13:25.04]sometimes you will have no choice but often you make the game louder and that is when the scales power or pity shed blood boy leave a crimson trail
[13:44.53]Okay.
[13:46.47]That guy wants violence.
[13:48.21]How's my character right now?
[13:49.21]Am I violence oriented or am I wisdom?
[13:53.58]I don't know.
[13:54.32]Let's go.
[14:02.05]Alright.
[14:02.53]I gotta get rid of this bone.
[14:04.03]But I can't throw it away.
[14:07.07]Think I'm going the right way?
[14:08.21]I'm not just doing a circle, right?
[14:18.51]What's happening?
[14:19.11]Am I doing a circle?
[14:21.94]No.
[14:22.38]Okay.
[14:24.86]Then we go left.
[14:27.84]Then we go... It's a haunted house, man.
[14:37.63]How did I end up back here?
[14:38.83]I fucked up.
[14:40.56]Dude, you know how badly I want to make a haunted house in real life?
[14:43.36]I have total creative control.
[14:45.48]It would be so fun to do that.
[14:49.23]I so badly want to make a haunted house where you can expect anything.
[14:57.76]Why does the soundtrack reset every time you go into a door?
[15:00.40]Because, I don't know, because the old 3DO.
[15:04.46]I got to pay attention.
[15:05.20]I got to go back and pay attention because I'm going to keep running in a circle if I don't.
[15:14.30]I got back to this guy again.
[15:15.68]Alright, the home line.
[15:18.84]That guy's behind me.
[15:22.09]Left is this door.
[15:24.99]Right is the, because that's the door I came out of.
[15:26.95]I'm going to go in this door, which it should be the red room, right?
[15:30.94]Okay.
[15:32.84]I'm going to leave.
[15:34.96]Go right.
[15:37.15]Both the doors behind me do not go to those doors.
[15:41.07]Do not go behind me at all.
[15:43.97]I got this one here, this one here, that, this one behind, this one's off limits.
[15:48.36]And it is technically the left door.
[15:51.66]Okay.
[15:51.90]So let's go in the right door.
[15:56.47]Okay.
[15:57.81]Then.
[15:58.13]Okay.
[16:03.06]Now we go in this side here.
[16:04.77]I'm, I'm, I'm back.
[16:08.72]And then I think we go right again.
[16:09.88]I think we can only go right.
[16:12.99]Yes, alright, so then, here we go.
[16:16.13]Let's fill this tankard up.
[16:26.85]No?
[16:31.51]What?
[16:33.78]I don't, you know, I don't put the water in the bucket?
[16:45.85]I had to click the ceiling!
[16:47.31]What is happening?
[16:51.82]Oh, the world is upside down!
[16:53.44]Um, okay.
[17:03.51]What am I supposed to do with this?
[17:05.07]What's the point of getting a bucket of water?
[17:10.26]Can I get some advice for myself?
[17:15.01]A bucket full of water.
[17:17.11]Yeah, no shit.
[17:22.70]Now what do I- where do I take this?
[17:25.26]Did I need to put a fire out somewhere, or...?
[17:32.07]Where can I take this water?
[17:33.37]Is something from before- earlier?
[17:39.78]Is he dumb?
[17:44.29]What do you... I just got a... I just got the... I don't know where the bucket of water goes.
[17:48.91]What do you want me to do with it?
[17:56.60]Do I combine it with something else?
[18:02.41]Who wants a bucket of water right now?
[18:07.49]I'm locked in.
[18:09.74]Alright, get rid of this.
[18:12.54]Can I actually throw this?
[18:13.86]If I put this on the ground, does this guy get mad?
[18:17.38]They tend to do that.
[18:18.36]If I drop anything, they will freak out.
[18:24.89]I'm throwing it in a safe spot.
[18:27.63]Okay, no one's going to get pissed off that I just did that, right?
[18:35.10]It's like going to the retirement home and watching the old people play carpet bowls.
[18:42.79]What does that mean?
[18:45.34]What does a carpet bowl?
[18:50.15]Old people don't... What do you mean?
[18:52.09]You set the pins up and you... And you play bowling on the carpet.
[18:57.06]Is that what you mean?
[19:01.27]Alright, do I put this water in that water?
[19:04.69]Let me just look around.
[19:10.89]I don't want to go in here.
[19:11.91]The music in here is horrible.
[19:16.22]Back to the witch?
[19:17.30]With the dog?
[19:22.07]What would you do with a bucket of water in this game?
[19:26.75]I'll wait till you ask specifically for the guide.
[19:31.65]I don't know.
[19:32.43]Give me a minute.
[19:33.49]Because I don't... It's going to be so stupid.
[19:35.99]It's going to be so specific.
[19:36.97]It's going to be... Like, what do you mean you didn't click this pillar with the bucket of water to dump it on there to reveal the magic door?
[19:42.34]Like, how come you didn't know that?
[19:44.34]I don't know.
[19:44.80]Yes, it is, by the way.
[19:48.20]It is like that.
[19:49.20]Oh, my God.
[19:55.35]Did somebody say something about it earlier?
[20:03.05]It's not clear at all.
[20:04.65]Alright, so where are we going?
[20:06.66]Give me a hint.
[20:07.60]Don't tell me where it is, but just give me... Give me, like, the screen I need to be on.
[20:16.19]Were people smarter back then, or did people just get stuck and give up?
[20:18.73]The second one.
[20:19.43]I can tell you from personal experience, it's the second one.
[20:22.60]I remember sitting down with my mother and father when I was younger, playing old point-and-click games like King's Quest, and just nobody had any idea what was going on.
[20:33.16]And both of them, who were functioning, complete, totally sane of mind and body adults, but had no idea what to do.
[20:43.65]What do you, I don't know, do you click the rabbit?
[20:46.07]Oh, okay, well it's time for bed anyways, Jeremy.
[20:48.61]And that was it.
[20:49.35]And then it never, that floppy disk never went in ever again.
[20:56.38]Alright, what's the, what map screen am I supposed to be on?
[21:03.26]The bucket is heavy.
[21:04.26]It might help weigh down something or activate a machine.
[21:07.55]Oh my god, I know exactly where to go.
[21:15.00]That's so funny.
[21:15.82]Alright, I know exactly what to do with it.
[21:18.37]Yeah, alright.
[21:20.43]Hold on.
[21:23.52]I gotta get back to where I just was.
[21:34.31]And that was back here.
[21:35.91]I gotta go back to the flower area.
[21:44.45]Mm-hmm.
[21:47.45]I know what to do.
[21:50.21]See, my mind is going to water.
[21:52.08]Extinguishing.
[21:53.76]Nourishment.
[21:55.82]An animal is gonna drink it.
[21:57.21]Or you're gonna dump it on something.
[21:59.37]No.
[22:00.25]It's to weigh this down.
[22:03.61]It's only based on the thing having weight.
[22:08.31]Let me save it in case something jumps out or whatever.
[22:10.39]There we go.
[22:25.35]Yeah, I guess if you're objectively speaking, that makes sense, I guess.
[22:32.43]Okay, here we go.
[22:34.01]New area.
[22:35.79]I need a weapon equipped in case I get attacked.
[22:51.32]Why do the... Why do the staircase do that?
[22:53.53]Do you see that?
[23:03.12]Why is it doing that there?
[23:08.19]Okay.
[23:08.77]I just found a treasure chest.
[23:09.95]I don't know.
[23:10.51]What did I do?
[23:18.90]I have a key.
[23:19.96]I'm going to open the... Watch this.
[23:22.77]Fuck.
[23:23.57]Come on.
[23:24.15]Really?
[23:26.09]Well, I got a box of money now.
[23:30.34]You were supposed to be upstairs to do that.
[23:34.27]Oh.
[23:35.26]Well, I did it.
[23:40.73]Can I not walk forward anymore?
[23:41.95]Did I mess it up?
[23:55.09]The seesaw is now dropped into the water.
[23:56.93]Should I put something else on here to weigh it down?
[24:03.79]What if I put it back?
[24:17.57]I don't know what to do.
[24:18.85]Alright, um... Maybe that's all I needed to do here.
[24:33.32]I don't think I can do anything else here.
[24:37.07]There's no indicator that I can do anything else.
[24:40.61]Maybe that's it.
[24:42.47]Alright.
[24:43.26]What does he say about the chest?
[24:47.76]The silver chest.
[24:51.51]Okay.
[24:58.06]Should I give this to somebody?
[25:02.43]Ah!
[25:03.17]Oh my god, get away from me.
[25:05.90]You want this?
[25:17.17]My image sits in the dolmen.
[25:19.96]Okay.
[25:25.63]I don't get it.
[25:33.43]I can't open it with the key.
[25:37.49]Is he jumping?
[25:40.52]I feel like that's not all I can do.
[25:43.26]Whoa.
[25:43.54]What is the dragon doing to me?
[25:47.27]The dragon's doing that... What's that Zelda CDI guy?
[25:52.97]Where he's just like... When he leans in, he leans with his eye.
[25:57.18]What is that guy?
[25:58.64]Morshu.
[25:59.22]Yeah, he's doing like the Morshu rock out thing.
[26:07.23]Maybe there's a button on the wall?
[26:17.28]Alright, just confirm with me that I didn't softlock it by doing the animation early.
[26:21.16]And I'll find a... Didn't that witch lady in the dog swamp pond want me to go on a quest?
[26:30.35]Say, yes, go on a quest.
[26:31.97]There's a cave here and I'll be waiting for you to complete.
[26:34.95]Is that what she wanted?
[26:36.60]Find out.
[26:49.35]Somebody wanted something.
[26:51.01]And I'm just going to check to see who it is that wanted whatever.
[26:57.56]What did you want?
[26:58.16]What did you want me to do?
[27:03.82]You told me to go to the tunnels.
[27:08.73]I did.
[27:09.03]Do you want a box?
[27:15.67]Okay.
[27:17.65]Okay.
[27:18.51]You don't want to box.
[27:19.77]I might just kill this person.
[27:20.81]I'm sorry.
[27:24.87]Should I just start swinging?
[27:41.01]What about the way... I have two open distinct quests.
[27:44.55]I don't know what you wanted me to do.
[27:47.55]What did she want me to do?
[27:53.64]What is this?
[27:54.24]What's that from?
[27:57.04]What is this?
[27:58.78]What is this?
[28:05.37]What is this?
[28:07.05]What is that?
[28:13.96]Don't I fly up there?
[28:18.89]No, not Sparta.
[28:20.31]What is this?
[28:25.22]It's from an RPG.
[28:31.21]She said there's a cave close by here that you need to go in there.
[28:46.21]Is there a cave here that I need to get to?
[28:48.89]That scared me.
[29:06.04]That's friendly.
[29:06.63]The dog is friendly.
[29:07.39]Don't worry.
[29:13.95]I don't see a cave in this zone.
[29:19.40]But she specifically said that there was a cave here.
[29:24.44]I have a chest now.
[29:25.26]I've got a key to whatever she wanted me to do.
[29:27.25]The chest now needs to go somewhere.
[29:31.49]I wish you could pet the dog.
[29:41.36]Hmm.
[29:51.30]Okay, you know in games where there's the light bulb in the corner up here, and when you click it once, it gives you a one-sentence vague hint of what you need to do next, and then you need to wait two or three minutes to click it again to give you the second more specific hint, and then you need to wait five minutes to click the third one, which kind of just gives you the answer.
[30:17.15]I would sometimes just sit there until all three of them were refreshed.
[30:21.34]I would sit there for 20 minutes and not do anything.
[30:24.92]Can I get that first light bulb?
[30:32.06]Very vague.
[30:33.12]Very vague.
[30:33.60]Very, very simple.
[30:44.06]The chest is the key to progressing.
[30:45.87]Okay.
[30:46.61]That's a great... That's actually like a great first lightbulb response.
[30:53.52]That is exactly what would happen.
[30:54.86]Okay, so do I just open it?
[30:56.46]Can I just open it?
[30:57.14]A silver chest.
[31:06.17]I just... Where would this go?
[31:07.35]The key is to... A cave...
[31:17.54]I have to give this to somebody.
[31:21.03]But I don't know who I would even give it to.
[31:23.99]Let me get out of this area.
[31:26.88]Maybe like the Mushroom Kingdom area?
[31:39.49]I gotta burn some of these places into permanent memory.
[31:41.30]It's hard though.
[31:49.86]Or is there a pedestal I can put this on somewhere that I just am not remembering?
[31:53.00]Let me go all the way back.
[31:57.59]We killed the little goblin gnome thing in here, guy.
[32:02.40]I didn't mean to.
[32:02.94]It was accidental.
[32:06.74]I don't think there's anything else I can do.
[32:08.18]Let me just go this way.
[32:08.82]Let me get out of here.
[32:10.53]Go back.
[32:10.89]This is where the plant is.
[32:21.52]Is there something I can do here?
[32:26.90]There's a lot of pedestals here.
[32:28.22]I'm going to keep backtracking just to see.
[32:38.18]Can I even backtrack anymore?
[32:43.06]It's not just put the chest on a pedestal, right?
[32:50.31]Okay, now I'm back at the dock.
[32:57.25]I already talked to you.
[32:58.09]I don't know.
[33:02.68]I really don't know.
[33:09.16]The specificity of stuff like this is just where, like... It's like, put the... It's like, put the bubblegum... Onto the... Door.
[33:21.01]And it's like, why did I put the bubblegum on the door?
[33:22.81]Well, because... You just had to.
[33:30.48]These are... Well, not... What Granny like is... A little different.
[33:36.27]Uh, what's the second lightbulb?
[33:46.26]You could easily get lost trying to find the lock the chest unlocks.
[33:55.33]I think I know where to go.
[33:56.08]I want another hint.
[33:59.76]Let me click the hint button.
[34:01.60]I'm sorry.
[34:02.08]You need 200 credits to do another hint.
[34:04.04]I'm sorry.
[34:04.53]You need 200 credits to do another hint.
[34:06.29]I'm sorry.
[34:08.25]Let me type my fucking iPad password in.
[34:11.43]Hold on.
[34:14.22]Yes, I want a thousand credits.
[34:17.25]No, alright, I know where to go.
[34:32.57]But now, if that's where I'm supposed to actually be... What the fuck do you do with this thing?
[34:44.86]Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do...
[35:00.88]I fucking hate this place.
[35:02.73]This place has such a required specific path to just walk in a straight line.
[35:07.43]And I went backwards.
[35:10.82]I just want to go straight to the other bridge.
[35:13.02]I don't want to walk around the whole fucking mushroom kingdom.
[35:16.34]I just want to go straight through here.
[35:17.77]Right there.
[35:18.73]And then, where's the bridge?
[35:24.80]Everything's so fucking blurry.
[35:31.66]Am I going insane?
[35:39.72]Where is the... What is going on?
[35:44.78]What?
[35:50.15]I'm losing my mind right now.
[35:52.37]Where is the other... Where's the exit to this place on the other side?
[36:13.90]Wait, didn't I go... What the fuck, dude?
[36:20.98]Okay, let's go.
[36:21.82]You know what I did to get out of that?
[36:27.91]I held my hand on the left wall to exit the maze eventually.
[36:33.21]And it worked.
[36:34.61]Almost instantly.
[36:35.45]So remember, if you're ever in a saw trap and it's dark, just find a wall, put your hand up and walk with the wall with your hand on the left side and follow the wall with your hand until you get around.
[36:50.49]Always follow left.
[36:53.91]You will eventually get out.
[37:00.02]Oh, wrong way.
[37:10.59]Alright, so it's gotta go in here somewhere.
[37:13.05]So again, we have to... Where have we gone?
[37:16.71]Right side.
[37:17.37]This is where the bucket was, but there might be another room here.
[37:23.26]That's where the bucket was.
[37:25.58]What about... Okay, it's only the bucket in here.
[37:28.67]So this is... We're gonna go back.
[37:32.77]There's the exit.
[37:40.07]Okay, so now let's go left this time.
[37:52.80]What is going on?
[37:53.48]Okay, I can't open this.
[37:55.96]If this opens this door, this would be the most insane granny-like experience I've ever had.
[38:03.05]Like, how would that make any sense, right?
[38:04.49]But what if it did?
[38:08.54]Oh!
[38:14.93]Wait, I'm just the other side.
[38:16.63]I was already in this room.
[38:20.96]Do I have to put this back on here?
[38:22.44]I walked all... I could have... I could have climbed up this.
[38:30.55]What?
[38:42.02]Huh?
[38:42.12]Huh?
[38:47.25]just back it up slowly right now that's okay I'm gonna go the other way I don't think I can do anything with that but that is the other side of that where I got the chest and that was the key that she told she gave wait a minute that lady gave me the key to go on a quest to get this but did I because I didn't use the key she's mad that I didn't use the key
[39:16.22]That lady gave me that key.
[39:18.02]Alright, what about in here?
[39:26.83]That was the door.
[39:33.00]What the fuck is this?
[39:38.01]Only my riches can bring me back to life.
[39:47.19]The riches I was originally buried with.
[39:50.79]Bring me back my riches and you will have the knowledge of the Dragon Knight.
[39:58.88]Told you.
[40:08.24]Oh, an old bug!
[40:17.38]there it is told you um
[40:46.74]So if I bring, if I bring this guy to the meeting and I just raise his hand, weekend at Bernie style when it's his turn, how, how would that be?
[41:01.85]And I just like put his hand up with a finger in the air.
[41:03.95]Yes.
[41:05.74]Ah, look, see, he voted for me.
[41:09.04]I guess he did just talk to me.
[41:12.16]Alright.
[41:12.38]Well that's that.
[41:12.90]I got a vote.
[41:15.02]What is this?
[41:15.60]Oh, torch.
[41:19.42]Easy.
[41:23.68]Oh shit.
[41:24.80]New character.
[41:28.13]Just kill the pipe, lad.
[41:30.70]Okay.
[41:31.88]Alright, so how do I get your vote?
[41:59.76]Duck dragon?
[42:12.51]collects precious stones of all kinds.
[42:18.18]It especially covets diamonds.
[42:22.25]They hypnotize the creature.
[42:24.63]Okay, so get a diamond.
[42:25.88]The furnace of the duck dragon's breath melts all its jewels together to make a single stone, the most magnificent jewel there is.
[42:39.23]Bring me that jewel, Werner, and you'll have my support.
[42:45.22]Otherwise, I'll vote with Dyakonov.
[42:48.62]Okay, so, huge mistake, biggest mistake of this guy's life.
[42:54.29]We don't have to do any of that.
[42:56.01]We have to find Dyakonov and get him to vote for us.
[43:00.54]And he probably just wants a cheesecake or something.
[43:02.32]He probably just wants something very simple.
[43:04.88]Why would we go fight a dragon and do the hardest mission in the whole game when he's just going to follow some other dude?
[43:11.32]Why don't we just get that dude's support?
[43:13.23]Who cares about that?
[43:14.59]I'm not going to fight a dragon when this guy will just follow somebody else.
[43:19.39]You know what?
[43:19.70]I'm going to kill this guy.
[43:21.06]I think I'm going to kill this guy.
[43:22.60]No, I'm not.
[43:26.82]You're safe for now.
[43:32.55]I thought that was a name tag at first.
[43:37.72]Oh, I gotta save.
[43:38.42]It's been a while.
[43:45.82]Alright, let's see this dragon.
[43:56.12]Pull.
[43:57.06]Oh.
[44:06.15]Nope.
[44:06.49]Um...
[44:10.35]Oh, God.
[44:12.25]Are you friendly?
[44:12.91]Nope.
[44:18.76]I killed it.
[44:21.86]Whoa, what is that?
[44:22.82]He dropped a diamond.
[44:26.35]I just got the duck dragon.
[44:29.01]That was the duck dragon.
[44:30.45]Was that the duck dragon?
[44:35.98]What the fuck?
[44:36.64]That was the dragon.
[44:37.44]I just killed the duck dragon.
[44:39.95]And he dropped the biggest diamond in the world!
[44:41.71]Oh man!
[44:46.12]He seems like kind of a rare, endangered species.
[44:49.03]I don't know if I should have done that.
[44:51.39]Um... Okay?
[45:00.22]So now what?
[45:01.07]I guess I can... Did I take the...
[45:08.33]That was just the pike he told you about.
[45:10.18]Oh, that's right!
[45:11.66]Okay, so... Now I have a diamond.
[45:18.09]No, get out of the water!
[45:23.47]Oh, I think I had to do that.
[45:29.30]Can I go this way?
[45:36.75]Just checking everything.
[45:37.95]You never know.
[45:43.11]Holy shit!
[45:43.89]What's in there is huge!
[45:45.80]That's way bigger than the pike I just sawed.
[45:50.27]Is that the duck dragon?
[46:01.47]I wonder if... Does he say anything about the diamond?
[46:05.30]Hey, come here for a second.
[46:12.89]What do you think about this?
[46:21.98]What?
[46:22.12]That is a... I'm holding a gigantic diamond.
[46:25.01]Now you're going to vote against me?
[46:26.37]I just wanted to come show you the cool...
[46:32.61]DIE!
[46:41.16]Am I even hitting him?
[46:57.22]Yeah, I hit him.
[47:05.29]Swing across, swing across.
[47:09.14]Come on!
[47:12.50]Yeah!
[47:16.21]Who is Daikonoff?
[47:17.69]Who is that?
[47:23.54]Oh, he just killed his friend.
[47:25.44]Is that bad?
[47:29.21]Does he have any items?
[47:31.49]Dude, the guy has the pickaxe.
[47:39.62]You're soft locked in no doubt now.
[47:42.24]Okay.
[47:49.47]I didn't kill everyone.
[47:50.52]I've killed two people.
[47:52.84]One of those.
[47:53.42]Okay.
[47:54.80]Give me a little bit of slack.
[47:57.77]The first dragon knight that I killed.
[48:01.29]attacked me because I dropped a wet cloth on the ground.
[48:07.20]That is what happened.
[48:09.96]There was nothing else about that.
[48:12.38]I dropped a wet cloth on the ground.
[48:16.37]That one doesn't count.
[48:17.79]The second one was the goblin in the village.
[48:21.62]I
[48:23.71]I tried to click a different item, and I right-clicked accidentally, and I killed him.
[48:29.72]So that was an accident.
[48:31.59]We actually went back and we changed that.
[48:35.79]This last one, he said he was going to vote against me, and he called me an idiot.
[48:42.75]And he said he was going to get his friend to vote against me too.
[48:45.17]He then said, didn't he say earlier that he was going to kill me or something?
[48:56.05]Can I even cross this?
[48:57.61]Let me go back.
[48:57.93]I want to go in the water.
[49:03.70]Is there any way to go past here?
[49:15.16]What about, like, can I go this way or anything?
[49:18.06]I feel like I'm missing something from here that I can do.
[49:27.64]Can I go the other door?
[49:28.62]Let me try... I just get turned around.
[49:31.54]When you jump in the water, the game, like, spins around.
[49:34.84]But I want to go this way.
[49:36.59]That way.
[49:39.29]Can I go through here?
[49:49.48]Okay.
[49:49.92]I'm on the other side.
[49:50.64]I want to go, like, there.
[49:53.12]No.
[49:53.76]No, no, no.
[49:54.41]Dude.
[49:56.11]Dude.
[49:57.47]Buddy, stop.
[49:58.29]I want to go in the water.
[50:10.61]There we go.
[50:11.15]Okay, I can go this way.
[50:19.68]There's a tree here.
[50:24.42]I'm saving it.
[50:26.02]This is where the dragon is.
[50:28.89]This looks like a duck dragon lair to me.
[50:40.20]This is a huge open field.
[50:42.01]I don't know about this.
[50:51.72]Boss fight time?
[50:57.29]Maybe if I take the diamond out?
[51:03.12]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[51:12.79]What is that?
[51:16.08]Can I grab that?
[51:16.42]No.
[51:16.50]Okay, I'll go across.
[51:28.49]Okay.
[51:33.16]Okay.
[51:44.49]I do have a diamond for the dragon.
[51:46.18]What if the dragon can help me?
[51:52.10]Okay, I can go up there.
[51:57.07]Anything else over here, though?
[52:02.65]This game is so interesting.
[52:03.81]I love this game.
[52:04.55]It's just so weird.
[52:07.31]It's a weird one.
[52:18.63]Why would it want me to go this close to the tree?
[52:30.88]Alright, well, let me go up then.
[52:34.85]I think I have to walk up the side?
[52:43.82]Hold on.
[52:46.60]I gotta find the right path.
[52:53.25]Nope.
[52:53.37]A little bit further.
[52:53.95]There.
[53:03.50]Slow down!
[53:12.70]Alright, I hope you're not that... ...dwarf's friend.
[53:34.38]I have a diamond!
[53:35.13]I look like I'm in leather Minecraft armor.
[53:40.57]I look like shit.
[53:43.75]Alright, are you... What's your name?
[53:47.74]If you are not the son of Axel von Wallenrod, then turn around and leave.
[53:53.41]Okay, we don't have beef.
[53:54.19]We're good.
[53:55.73]I, Helena of the House of Dartica, have sworn to let none but Werner von Wallenrod past this place.
[54:06.61]Well, that's good, because I can prove to you that that's me, or I... That's my... I'm his son.
[54:12.66]What do you think about this?
[54:14.72]Your father was a brave and just knight.
[54:19.18]He could not wish his son to be any different.
[54:21.85]We won't break the Pact of Peace, since we're not enemies.
[54:28.29]Our two families have been allies for many generations.
[54:33.18]Friendly duel?
[54:33.50]A friendly duel, that's all I'm suggesting.
[54:37.04]Either of us may end it by throwing down their weapon.
[54:40.70]Okay.
[54:41.40]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[54:41.85]Wait, how am I going to put my ring down?
[54:43.35]Let me put my ring down.
[54:44.39]Let me take my rings off.
[54:50.06]You'll have my vote if you continue to act with honor.
[54:54.22]What?
[54:55.92]Did she just... Your father would be proud of your courage.
[55:00.49]I haven't even swung.
[55:01.41]Burner Von Wallenrod.
[55:04.19]You may throw down your weapon with honor.
[55:07.42]You are truly a man of honor.
[55:08.72]I'm in mid-swing.
[55:09.18]This is not good.
[55:09.94]I'm in mid-swing right now.
[55:11.54]You know the difference between courage and brutality.
[55:13.26]If it comes back from the little dialog and fucking hits her... You can count on my vote.
[55:19.07]Don't do it!
[55:20.03]I've healed you with a spell, Werner.
[55:24.64]You'll need all your strength for the castle.
[55:28.08]Take this.
[55:29.09]It will serve you once only.
[55:33.77]What the fuck?
[55:35.45]Is she wearing any pants?
[55:39.84]She's naked.
[55:41.20]She was completely naked.
[55:43.14]What the hell was going on there?
[55:44.78]What the fuck?
[55:48.87]She gave me a pickaxe.
[55:51.13]Oh, great.
[55:52.53]What am I supposed to do with this?
[55:54.77]I already have one of those.
[55:58.23]This one's gold.
[56:02.50]I'm just going to throw this.
[56:12.84]So what is this?
[56:13.66]It's a... A pickaxe.
[56:15.84]So what is this?
[56:18.30]A two-horned club.
[56:19.75]Okay, dude.
[56:22.57]Please.
[56:23.13]You just want to make people think that you have a better, bigger collection than you actually have.
[56:28.09]That's a pickaxe.
[56:30.02]But you're not going to put it in the pickaxe category because it needs a different case on your shelf.
[56:36.46]Oh, no, no, no.
[56:37.02]That's a two-horned club.
[56:39.11]That's not a pickaxe.
[56:39.89]It's a two-horned club.
[56:42.27]Shut up.
[56:44.07]Alright, now I can probably break rocks somewhere.
[56:47.38]Where's my chest?
[56:50.72]Oh, right, I gave it to that skeleton.
[57:00.38]Can I go down from here?
[57:02.00]Okay, I can go down and around.
[57:13.10]Man, this guy is stupid.
[57:15.52]I know I'm controlling him.
[57:18.00]But... If it was me, I would have just jumped off the ledge.
[57:22.33]I would have already been down there.
[57:24.91]I'm taking the most direct path.
[57:28.32]I don't... Like, come on.
[57:29.48]What is going on here?
[57:30.34]I just need to find the right way to go.
[57:34.39]And it's like... Around... Where is the little path I have to click on?
[57:43.81]How did I go backwards?
[57:56.11]Excuse me.
[57:57.99]It's me, the dragon talking.
[58:00.83]Do you see him over there?
[58:02.03]He's having a lot of trouble.
[58:04.48]Is he trying to stay up there or is he trying to get down?
[58:08.60]I don't know.
[58:09.10]His father sure would have found a way down by now.
[58:12.03]That's a little concerning.
[58:13.21]Maybe you should not vote for this guy.
[58:15.11]He doesn't even know where the stairs are.
[58:18.48]Know your place, dragon.
[58:20.28]Okay, sorry, mistress or whatever I'm going to call you.
[58:32.58]How the fuck do I get down?
[58:43.90]Get me down!
[58:44.96]I actually can't get down.
[58:58.50]Wait, what?
[58:58.96]Alright, we gotta... Hey, you stuck in the maze?
[59:03.03]Stay on that left wall.
[59:05.13]I'm holding my hand on the left wall right now.
[59:30.21]Looks like he got down.
[59:35.85]He got down.
[59:36.42]It's okay.
[59:39.88]Quiet, dragon.
[59:41.58]Yes, mistress.
[59:58.76]I can go around, I think.
[60:00.92]Don't do the mistress thing again.
[60:02.75]Hey.
[60:04.23]I'm doing me, you do you, okay?
[60:11.98]I don't know why I just spoke as the dragon there.
[60:14.03]Like, you were telling the dragon to stop doing that?
[60:17.95]Hey, I'm doing me.
[60:22.02]Wait, I don't want to go this way.
[60:30.49]But there's another path I could go down, right?
[60:32.83]Am I crazy or there was another path to go around here?
[60:35.23]Or is that just a circle leading me to the exit?
[60:41.66]Alright, well, I have a... Wait, what's that?
[60:46.60]This is weird looking, isn't it?
[60:56.79]We're never going to get to the dragon duck.
[61:00.67]Yeah, we are, dude.
[61:01.50]Don't worry.
[61:04.00]Okay, so that's it.
[61:05.20]I did what I needed to do.
[61:07.85]I need to find a place for the pickaxe.
[61:11.09]Is there a bundle of rocks or a bunch of shit I could smash somewhere?
[61:15.02]I feel like that's going to be insanely specific.
[61:33.23]Hey, I'm new to the stream, by the way.
[61:34.45]Holy shit.
[61:35.45]Wait, I want to see that cutscene.
[61:36.97]I feel like it'd be fun.
[61:44.64]How do I... How does he get up the waterfall?
[61:46.42]That's a really good question, right?
[61:51.03]Whoa!
[61:53.69]What the fuck?
[61:56.83]This... I'm glad I wanted to see the cutscene, because this is different.
[61:59.72]Is this a... Wait.
[62:00.88]That's a duck dragon!
[62:15.13]I feel like it's more intimidating a guy walking into a lair with a book in his hand rather than a weapon.
[62:23.36]Because with a weapon, you know that weapon hit hurt me.
[62:28.73]Weapon is scary, can hurt, but it has to hit me.
[62:33.42]Spell book could be anything.
[62:35.44]He could have fireball in there.
[62:36.69]He could have illusion.
[62:37.99]He could have doppelganger.
[62:40.15]He could have meteor.
[62:42.30]I don't know what... You can't see what is in his mind.
[62:47.15]So I think it's scarier to see a mage walk in than a guy with a battleaxe because I fucking know what you got.
[62:51.80]That guy could start mumbling down and it's just like, what's going to happen?
[62:56.06]Although all of a sudden like 10 of them show up.
[63:04.10]Um, what is... Can I interact?
[63:08.06]Look what I got.
[63:14.03]He's so cute!
[63:18.32]Oh, now I'm like allowed in his house now.
[63:22.14]Cool.
[63:22.70]Does he talk?
[63:24.48]He just gave me a cool gem.
[63:27.03]Oh...
[63:32.62]Oh, I was supposed to bring that to the dwarf.
[63:35.78]I don't think I need this anymore.
[63:40.17]I shouldn't have killed that guy.
[63:50.54]He didn't even give me a chance, though.
[63:51.96]He's like, I am immediately voting against you because you showed me a diamond.
[63:55.78]All I was expecting was him to go, whoa, cool, man.
[64:02.84]not yeah that's not the one I wanted I hate you and I'm I'm gonna you're not gonna be a dragon knight and then he said how about you and I was like what the well I think that's all I can do I do anything else he would have changed his mind if you brought him the right one well whatever whatever can I mind this
[64:31.95]I'm not killing this dragon.
[64:33.73]Look at how cool he is.
[64:34.62]Are you serious?
[64:37.52]He's so happy that he has a friend and I brought him a diamond and he gave me his omega diamond.
[64:42.21]That dragon lives.
[64:43.37]Sorry.
[65:00.94]no that's not how that works okay um so now I got a pickaxe what do I do with the pickaxe you just become Super Mario when he feels like it although sometimes I decide to have the shield on and the staff the walking stick and sometimes I just don't I tell you it's an aesthetic thing it's whatever he feels like
[65:32.21]Okay, so, pickaxe.
[65:35.53]Is it gonna be rubble somewhere?
[65:43.59]Rubble.
[65:43.75]Is there rubble anywhere?
[65:46.87]Oh, well.
[65:52.56]There you go.
[65:54.74]You can't still take it?
[65:57.26]Oh, okay.
[66:12.96]That pickaxe could be for anything.
[66:19.95]I might click on the lightbulb for the vague lightbulb hint.
[66:26.80]Because that scares me a little.
[66:29.21]Because remember at the beginning of the game when I picked a random wall to use the blood chamber on?
[66:35.67]I don't think I would have done that.
[66:38.72]I might be using the mod lightbulb.
[66:46.90]If you could magically make a game exist, what would it be?
[66:49.12]It'd be the chimpanzee game.
[66:50.78]It's a Dark Souls game, but you're an ape in an unforgiving, brutal, roguelike jungle.
[66:59.39]And you have to just survive.
[67:00.29]You have to eat.
[67:00.99]There's a food meter.
[67:01.91]There's a thirst meter.
[67:03.78]It's very forgiving.
[67:04.54]That's not the hard part.
[67:06.04]But you gotta just live for like 10 days as like an ape.
[67:13.27]And the skill trees...
[67:23.91]Where would I take this pickaxe?
[67:42.75]That's such a... I hate that.
[67:43.87]I don't want to see that.
[67:45.13]It's like a reminder that I... I could have gotten that guy's vote.
[67:48.66]I could have gotten two votes!
[67:52.42]Whatever.
[67:55.46]Alright, pickaxe.
[68:01.85]Pickaxe.
[68:04.68]Pickaxe.
[68:04.86]Where would I go with a pickaxe?
[68:07.46]I'm gonna click the first level one light bulb.
[68:17.84]Pickaxe need not travel far from where it was obtained.
[68:23.32]Interesting.
[68:26.31]Interesting.
[68:34.08]Very good.
[68:34.82]Very good hint.
[68:45.40]Was it something up in the skull area?
[68:47.88]Or right here?
[68:52.20]That's a level two light bulb?
[68:54.20]No, no, no.
[68:54.44]I think that's it.
[68:59.13]There's got to be something here then.
[69:01.07]It's just one of these pile of rocks I'm going to be able to hit.
[69:11.62]Right there?
[69:24.41]Let's get back to here.
[69:26.29]Maybe there's another path I can do.
[69:41.81]OK, here we are.
[69:42.39]Ah, that's a that looks like a gigantic rock.
[69:51.95]Is that a gigantic rock?
[69:54.21]It looks like it.
[70:01.46]I feel like I looked over there though.
[70:04.14]Wait.
[70:05.46]Huh?
[70:09.23]How do I get over there?
[70:12.25]Oh, that's weird.
[70:13.17]That's weirdly placed.
[70:16.08]This is weirdly placed.
[70:16.92]I can't even look at it head on.
[70:25.21]I can't even look at this head on.
[70:30.68]I'm supposed to be expected to think that that's important.
[70:34.18]How do I even walk straight down there?
[70:35.68]I want to go that way.
[70:52.40]Let's go.
[70:57.43]Oh.
[71:00.97]That's a bad guy.
[71:01.69]It'd be funny if the bad guys could vote for you, too.
[71:10.06]Oh, no.
[71:15.07]We gotta kill this guy.
[71:24.83]Your father was a fool.
[71:26.92]Just like his father before him.
[71:29.80]A family of fools.
[71:31.57]Even if you get as far as the election.
[71:34.31]And believe me, you won't.
[71:37.32]You can't hope to win.
[71:40.10]Take my advice.
[71:41.95]Give up while you have the chance.
[71:44.69]Run back to your farm.
[71:46.75]Daisy is so lonely without you.
[71:49.96]Oh, farm boy!
[71:51.10]I've decided to give you an axe to cut down the old tree.
[71:57.03]It should have been done long ago, but your ancestors were sentimental.
[72:02.92]Ha ha ha!
[72:08.71]Why is he giving this to me and laughing about it?
[72:14.33]That's not an impressive jump.
[72:22.26]I thought he was going to take off into the sky.
[72:25.05]That was a very human, normal human male.
[72:28.07]Just, I'm a human and I can jump kind of far.
[72:31.52]That was not impressive for how much red the world just got.
[72:36.06]Okay, well he's not voting for us.
[72:39.86]And here's the... What if I don't want to do that?
[72:44.34]Can I choose not to cut this tree down?
[72:46.21]What if it's an old ancient wisdom tree or something?
[72:48.87]Does it talk?
[72:57.40]That was a very strange interaction, by the way.
[73:08.24]Okay, well, I guess it's already... It's dead?
[73:11.04]Why... I guess I'm just gonna do it.
[73:18.99]That's such a weak, wuss way to do that.
[73:24.02]You gotta do it.
[73:24.82]You have to have it better.
[73:27.02]That was a fucking wimp noise.
[73:32.69]No, it's... Okay.
[73:37.70]Bro, you can do way better than that.
[73:39.71]That was ridiculous.
[73:57.29]Okay, save it.
[74:02.96]Hey, can we get a couple more of those noises?
[74:05.68]Get out of here.
[74:07.60]Uh-oh!
[74:09.51]Wait, is that?
[74:10.35]No.
[74:11.05]Who are these people?
[74:11.89]This is just like, I'm just playing World of Warcraft.
[74:13.99]I'm into the Barrens.
[74:16.41]Ah!
[74:21.44]Fuck.
[74:23.70]What are these two guys doing out here?
[74:26.10]I'm getting stream sniped.
[74:27.80]I'm getting griefed in the Barrens.
[74:31.51]I guess we're just going to put... It's hammer time.
[74:44.31]Oh, big spin.
[74:47.09]Who are these guys?
[74:53.48]I am hurting both of them, I think.
[75:00.09]It's so dangerous out here.
[75:05.32]That's such a bad way to fall.
[75:07.88]That's a bad way to fall and die together.
[75:10.17]That's just not a good way to fall together.
[75:12.85]Would you have a sack of coins?
[75:16.86]Shit, what do I give you?
[75:17.84]I'm going to take a fucking leaf.
[75:23.57]I need to put this... I'm screwed.
[75:28.53]I can't replace this.
[75:31.09]A bag.
[75:38.66]I need to... No, please let me be able to pick that up still.
[75:42.14]Get rid of these stupid plants.
[75:44.30]I love plants, but you know what I mean?
[75:45.63]Fuck you.
[75:54.56]What else can I just throw away?
[75:56.06]Where's the bone?
[75:57.04]What is this?
[76:02.37]Whoa, I don't want to throw away the dragon ring.
[76:08.06]I'm getting rid of this sword.
[76:09.12]I don't even use it.
[76:17.75]Staff.
[76:18.67]And that's a cool looking sword.
[76:24.70]He could have spoken to them.
[76:25.94]I don't know if they have anything important to say.
[76:27.96]They just ran up on me and started attacking me.
[76:32.65]I couldn't do anything.
[76:37.76]I turned around.
[76:38.60]I was just walking down the barrens.
[76:43.53]I looked in the chat.
[76:44.35]I just saw I couldn't understand the language.
[76:47.29]I saw, you know, kek, kek, kek.
[76:51.44]Oh, God.
[76:52.30]Hold on.
[76:59.98]This is Goro.
[77:02.63]Can I talk to you?
[77:04.21]Werner Van Wallenrod.
[77:05.97]I am Sylvan of Sigil.
[77:08.22]And I am Alexander of Egregalien.
[77:11.26]You need votes if you want to join the Brotherhood of Dragon Knights.
[77:14.77]A vase was stolen from me by two thieves.
[77:18.56]Do I get two votes?
[77:23.51]We get two votes right here.
[77:27.94]Easy.
[77:28.52]That's a cool character, though.
[77:33.50]I like that.
[77:36.81]Alright.
[77:48.21]It still counts as one vote?
[77:50.16]No, it's got to count as two, right?
[77:51.36]That's two distinct brains.
[78:02.60]I like how there are roller coaster tycoon benches.
[78:07.44]Like, I would have put that bench there in the build mode.
[78:10.87]You know what I'm saying?
[78:13.37]The unbroken vase is mine, Werner.
[78:16.90]Give it to me if you want my vote.
[78:19.60]You lie as always, Sylvan.
[78:21.96]The broken vase is yours.
[78:23.86]The other is mine.
[78:25.05]Hand it to me, Werner.
[78:28.11]How do I hand it to... You both... Do I have it already?
[78:35.68]What is this?
[78:37.72]I didn't want to drink it!
[78:38.54]What did I just drink?
[78:39.60]I wanted to know what it was!
[78:45.30]What was it?
[78:50.23]Should I reset?
[78:53.48]Do I already have a broken vase?
[78:57.72]Dude, you drank their mother's ashes.
[78:59.95]They didn't give it to me.
[79:02.59]Okay, it was a healing potion.
[79:03.79]We don't need that.
[79:05.22]I'm gonna be so pissed if I need it later.
[79:07.74]What do I still have this for?
[79:08.84]A whistle.
[79:09.66]For what?
[79:10.20]Why am I whistling?
[79:20.18]Honestly, I feel like I'm going to need that potion at the end of the game.
[79:26.85]Where was I?
[79:27.26]Save space one.
[79:34.51]Yeah.
[79:37.47]I don't... That potion... Hey!
[79:39.98]Werner Van Wallenrod.
[79:41.76]I am Sylvan of Sigil.
[79:43.82]I heard they're swinging at me.
[79:47.55]Are they attacking me?
[79:52.49]What's he doing?
[79:56.92]Stop, stop, stop.
[79:58.18]Is he attacking me?
[79:58.86]What did I do?
[79:59.38]I didn't do anything.
[80:00.24]He's just aura farming.
[80:07.71]Oh, okay.
[80:09.64]The unbroken vase is mine, Werner.
[80:12.83]You lie as always, Sylvan.
[80:15.19]The broken vase is... Okay.
[80:22.42]I don't know.
[80:29.42]The whistle is pointless now, apparently.
[80:32.02]It's the same as the bone.
[80:33.06]It was needed for the beginning of the game.
[80:35.87]Okay, well... Are they going to get pissed off that I throw a whistle on the ground?
[80:45.26]I'm doing this far away.
[80:52.45]You're cool with that, right?
[80:55.76]Okay.
[80:57.14]Um, what else can I get rid of?
[81:02.46]Maybe... What kind of sword is this?
[81:05.37]Yeah, I gotta keep this.
[81:06.11]This thing sounds kind of great.
[81:14.14]That sword seems really good.
[81:17.43]What else should I throw away?
[81:21.13]Maybe the dagger?
[81:24.62]Eh.
[81:25.60]The dagger's... I have so much better weapons.
[81:27.42]I don't need this.
[81:30.44]You can throw the gem away?
[81:31.70]Can I?
[81:32.18]What if I need it for something else?
[81:36.47]He's gonna get mad about this.
[81:40.53]I have to do this somewhere else.
[81:46.42]What?
[81:47.34]Excuse me?
[82:03.13]You had to solve that problem for them first.
[82:10.42]Why am I getting an advertisement for the game?
[82:15.43]It's disk two.
[82:19.53]Oh shit, how do I do this?
[82:25.92]Is disk two... Oh fuck.
[82:31.53]Yeah!
[82:32.37]Okay, GOG just automatically does it.
[82:37.36]Here's the thing that's funny.
[82:40.06]If I want to go back, I have to put disk one in.
[82:46.01]I don't think I can solve it.
[82:47.05]I have to go back, right?
[82:50.32]I have to go back.
[82:53.12]It is what it is.
[82:55.69]I lost both of their votes because of that.
[82:57.65]I have to go back.
[83:12.42]So what are they talking about?
[83:13.52]A broken vase?
[83:14.94]Do I even have one of those?
[83:17.86]Where is a broken vase?
[83:22.55]Okay.
[83:23.59]What?
[83:26.42]The unbur- Is it this?
[83:31.67]This is a bag.
[83:42.00]Okay, two thieves.
[83:43.62]I feel like I killed the two thieves.
[83:45.40]They didn't have a vase on them.
[83:50.13]Excuse me.
[83:52.03]It's just in this area.
[83:55.82]How?
[83:57.20]Are you the two thieves?
[83:59.96]And you just forgot?
[84:15.78]So I cannot leave this area.
[84:21.13]Maybe I have to give them a bag?
[84:22.67]Yeah, this is weird.
[84:24.17]Something going on here.
[84:25.12]Okay.
[84:27.02]So two thieves stole a vase, but I can't leave this area until I get them a vase.
[84:45.33]Over here?
[84:51.94]Can I open the bag?
[85:03.87]Oh boy.
[85:10.41]Oh boy.
[85:12.53]Oh boy, I'm not ready for this.
[85:15.74]oh boy what do I get rid of the whistle right right right okay we're good get rid of the whistle and get rid of the uh dagger okay so I have to give them how do I hand a vase how do I click on them correctly
[85:45.71]Can I store stuff in the bag?
[85:47.25]Wait.
[85:49.42]Oh man, that's awesome actually.
[85:56.33]I can store three.
[85:57.85]I can store four items in this bag.
[86:00.78]That's kind of huge.
[86:02.08]So wait a minute.
[86:03.34]What's in this?
[86:06.67]Sulfur.
[86:07.57]Why is there sulfur in this?
[86:20.35]Let me save this so I can figure this out.
[86:23.44]I really need both these votes, so I can save scum this if I really need to, can't I?
[86:29.30]Don't load it, you dingus.
[86:35.11]Okay.
[86:36.27]How does this work?
[86:37.59]The unbroken vase is mine, Werner.
[86:41.07]Give it to me if you want my vote.
[86:43.95]You lie as always, Sylvan.
[86:46.14]The broken vase is yours.
[86:48.02]The other is mine.
[86:50.02]But how do I determine who I'm giving it to?
[87:00.96]You've chosen well, Werner.
[87:03.31]My vote will be yours.
[87:05.29]Fool!
[87:06.49]Can't you tell an honest man from a liar?
[87:10.62]I hope you don't die in your castle so I can have the pleasure of watching you lose the election.
[87:18.95]Is the point that they cancel each other out?
[87:22.24]What if I give you the other one?
[87:31.02]Okay, the point is that it's a null.
[87:33.35]They cancel each other out.
[87:36.57]Are you dropping frames right now?
[87:38.25]I don't think so.
[87:43.53]No.
[87:53.14]So I don't need the broken base anymore.
[87:55.95]Let us throw it on the ground.
[88:00.81]OK.
[88:02.06]I have a canceled out vote.
[88:03.62]Now I can go to disk 2.
[88:05.06]I'm ready.
[88:05.46]I'm good to go.
[88:19.81]Kinda want this box.
[88:41.97]Alright, before we move on to disk two, I'm going to take a quick break.
[88:45.48]I'm going to pee.
[88:46.62]I'm going to get another coffee.
[88:48.96]Decaf.
[88:50.43]Decaf kind of day now.
[88:51.61]I already had a regular coffee.
[88:54.32]I'll be right back.
[88:55.46]See you guys in five minutes or so.
[88:59.39]BRB.
[93:45.16]I haven't turned.
[93:46.16]Hello.
[93:50.83]Are we ready?
[93:53.54]I'll turn the volume back up a little.
[93:55.10]Okay.
[94:02.07]Hi!
[94:04.00]Let's begin disk two.
[94:16.30]So this is the castle.
[94:22.26]Whoa.
[94:26.21]What is OK?
[94:27.17]Gotta put something in his mouth.
[94:35.14]Uh.
[94:37.82]The dragon ring.
[94:43.45]Um.
[94:47.95]my dragon ring.
[94:58.99]Nope.
[95:00.41]I probably get something in here.
[95:08.48]Alright, what else is in here?
[95:17.11]Is that it?
[95:19.12]Oh shit Does it talk?
[95:47.83]Oh, no.
[95:50.53]I must have to put something in his mouth, then activate it.
[96:01.66]What's his problem?
[96:14.34]It doesn't look like I can go anywhere else.
[96:18.05]Do I have to go back to disk one?
[96:24.78]I must have something I can put in there now.
[96:26.18]Unless can I... I guess I'm going into his crotch.
[96:29.66]Uh oh.
[96:33.06]I think this... You're friendly, right?
[96:36.51]Are you friendly?
[96:41.89]I think this dragon is blocking... You're blocking the path.
[96:48.69]Is this a fight scenario?
[96:53.48]I really don't know.
[96:55.54]I can't go any further.
[96:59.59]What about show the ring?
[97:01.35]Come on, that's.
[97:05.24]Oh, stand aside.
[97:06.80]I was just about to attack.
[97:12.07]That was way bigger than he looked on my screen.
[97:20.77]Oh.
[97:24.62]Whoa, this is cool room.
[97:26.82]I can't tell if this person is friendly or not.
[97:29.56]Judging by the way they're walking slowly, they look zombie like this is potentially a attack.
[97:37.33]With the new weapon.
[97:39.44]That's a zombie.
[97:40.08]Absolutely there's 100% zombie.
[97:46.93]Why am I so much taller?
[97:54.51]got him spiked club no I don't want it okay I can go that way let me just go to the front uh I'm gonna sit in this throne that snake is gonna bite me in the neck and I'm gonna die
[98:35.78]Yeah, that's through the eyes of the snake.
[98:39.67]Sit down in the throne.
[98:41.93]My master, Hagen von Diakonov, sent me with a gift, Lord.
[98:48.64]It is a token of the new peace between the dragon knight families.
[98:57.21]A noble gesture from my old enemy.
[98:59.43]That's me!
[99:00.65]Thank you, master.
[99:03.10]A serpent of brass.
[99:05.77]And finally wrought.
[99:08.35]What is this?
[99:10.33]There is dried blood on this serpent's head.
[99:14.84]That looks like when somebody makes a character in Soulcalibur.
[99:18.79]They all end up looking like that.
[99:23.99]What?
[99:31.38]May your bones rot before my throne.
[99:37.95]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[99:44.38]That's dad.
[99:51.43]We don't have a mustache like that.
[99:54.45]I don't know why I thought that was us.
[99:57.79]Okay, so he's poisoned.
[99:59.15]They killed him and this is bad.
[100:06.48]What was the gift?
[100:09.39]Just being able to see that vision.
[100:11.09]Did it give me anything?
[100:16.72]The actual... Okay, the snake.
[100:18.86]Where is it?
[100:24.57]The brass serpent.
[100:29.83]Was it a physical item or was it just a kind of... Oh, your dad got the snake.
[100:34.80]You didn't.
[100:36.16]Oh.
[100:37.38]We couldn't have got it from...
[100:40.93]Whatever.
[100:42.81]There's a lot of ways to go in here.
[100:44.23]I'm just going to go straight through here.
[100:51.18]Ooh.
[100:56.47]Place a sword.
[100:57.65]Oh no.
[100:59.91]Did I have kept that sword?
[101:01.59]Was that my family sword that I threw away?
[101:06.00]Was that actually... Did I need that?
[101:18.76]No, right?
[101:21.44]That would suck if that... I guess I could go pick it up.
[101:23.68]It should be on the ground still.
[101:31.79]There's nothing interactable on the table.
[101:42.10]It actually might be.
[101:43.30]It was a very specific looking sword.
[101:52.47]Why are you showing me this?
[101:53.36]There's got to be something I can do with this, then.
[101:56.46]That's weird to have it zoom in like that.
[102:03.83]Okay, well, for now, I'm just going to leave.
[102:07.96]There's a door on the right.
[102:24.56]Alchemy station.
[102:35.81]What's in here?
[102:39.56]I could interact with something over here.
[102:44.12]What do I put up here?
[102:45.19]A potion?
[102:53.55]What on Earth are you talking about?
[103:26.02]Okay, well, I can go in here.
[103:28.76]Can I smash this with the hammer?
[103:38.29]Come on, I can't break in here.
[103:49.61]Do we need a key to get this open?
[103:51.09]Alright.
[103:51.33]Well, this... Let me explore all the rooms because there probably is stuff to... It's granny-like stuff, right?
[103:57.48]What is going... Okay.
[103:58.79]What the fuck?
[104:01.71]A dragon god ifigi.
[104:05.80]Maybe put that in the dragon's mouth?
[104:20.89]I know it's effigy.
[104:23.38]I used to call it effigy when I played Dark Souls 1 like 10 years ago.
[104:29.15]Know the lore of the channel.
[104:31.66]This looks breakable.
[104:45.02]Well, I have that.
[104:46.47]I'm going to check the other rooms.
[104:48.05]It's going to be very, very smooth and silky and buttery.
[105:00.52]There are two doors over here.
[105:02.52]Let's check this one.
[105:06.77]If you've got your own lore, it's Dark Souls 2.
[105:10.29]It's Dark Souls 1 Remastered and Dark Souls 3.
[105:13.80]I did it for all of them.
[105:19.13]Secret entrance.
[105:24.22]And we have to play a game of chess.
[105:25.56]This is going to go miserably.
[105:26.62]Oh no.
[105:31.31]Do I actually have to play chess?
[105:35.48]What is this?
[105:39.97]A small key.
[105:51.78]Ooh, I can look in there.
[105:55.66]Why is he doing that?
[105:56.95]Small key?
[106:01.53]Maybe I need the key.
[106:07.68]Duuude.
[106:09.84]It's one piece of the Von Wellenrod seal.
[106:19.45]I need probably... That looks like I need a lot of pieces.
[106:23.52]I only need 10 of these.
[106:38.22]My son.
[106:43.55]Since the day you were born, I knew you were going to be king.
[106:50.10]And remember son, no king rules forever.
[106:56.73]Keep that in mind.
[107:02.67]And remember, no king rules forever.
[107:25.08]Uh-oh.
[107:33.68]I'm not ready to go up there.
[107:36.06]Save it.
[107:37.44]Ow, my body.
[107:45.39]Can I not go up here?
[107:49.48]This is very weirdly neat to... I don't know why he's doing it like this.
[107:52.24]Why would I go down?
[107:55.29]What?
[107:56.09]Is there a note?
[107:56.85]What does the note say?
[108:02.62]You need all the pieces of the family jewels.
[108:06.65]No.
[108:16.50]No.
[108:19.09]This looks like a square.
[108:23.05]No.
[108:27.54]Wait!
[108:37.01]Where is, uh, dop?
[108:40.11]Open door.
[108:43.61]Uh, double circle bug math.
[108:54.32]Okay.
[109:06.06]That didn't work.
[109:15.61]I want to go up the stairs though.
[109:21.66]I know I can't go up.
[109:24.04]Where's the one place to click to make sure I can go up the stairs?
[109:33.07]I can't go up.
[109:44.32]Uh, I know where that goes.
[109:49.63]I just heard Poke say, what the fuck?
[109:54.72]Do you know what I mean?
[109:55.26]I just heard him do that.
[109:56.78]And I got, I was like, shit, yeah.
[110:10.32]the tuber reaction yeah that was so funny when he did that I like I love that alright so this has to go which one was this one wait what's on the ground this is different this is a library uh who's that
[110:37.26]There are many ways to free a soul that is caged, but here is the simplest.
[110:45.51]Lay the receptacle in which the soul is trapped, usually a small copy of the victim, before the victim's feet.
[110:55.52]Then break the receptacle with a symbol of Harsk, the god that is man and dragon.
[111:03.72]This is one of those mobile game ads.
[111:15.70]Alright, so let me do it.
[111:17.98]Oh, this is instructions.
[111:23.04]Okay, so we have the effigy.
[111:26.86]Lay it down.
[111:30.73]So you put it down before them.
[111:37.40]Then you break it with a hammer of some kind.
[111:41.05]And then they'll be shaked and sprinkled sprinkles on it.
[111:44.59]Okay.
[111:45.67]One of you guys will remember that.
[111:50.42]I'll be fine.
[112:03.22]Oh my god, it'd be so funny if that was just like a recipe for, you know, you eat somebody and they're cooking people or something.
[112:09.38]It'd be crazy.
[112:10.62]We just misinterpreted it.
[112:13.95]That's kind of a scary picture.
[112:28.26]Nothing else.
[112:29.72]Just checking.
[112:32.38]One of these books could be grabbable.
[112:41.05]That's a book that looks... No.
[112:44.48]One of these is going to be a secret passage, though, right?
[112:50.57]No.
[112:53.33]Okay.
[112:55.46]Well, good to know.
[113:02.68]Can I touch your eye?
[113:04.19]No.
[113:08.73]Let me put the sword back where it belongs.
[113:10.74]There's a lot of rooms here.
[113:12.32]Hold on.
[113:12.78]I'm going to get confused if I don't blow down.
[113:23.50]Okay, let's put the sword back.
[113:24.46]Save it just in case something crazy happens.
[113:36.28]Boom.
[113:38.41]What is it?
[113:40.57]A bar of gold.
[113:44.55]Part of the- Ahhhh.
[113:48.14]Nice.
[113:49.04]That didn't even help- Look at how shitty that is.
[113:51.02]That didn't even help.
[113:52.97]Who cuts a pizza like that?
[113:54.37]What the hell are you doing?
[113:55.89]That's a fucked up slice.
[114:02.48]That barely even added more to the volume.
[114:07.70]Okay, I got that one.
[114:17.47]What else did I just get?
[114:18.66]So now I've got... I gotta figure out what to do with this.
[114:27.50]Hey, stop streaming.
[114:28.06]I didn't finish the VOD.
[114:30.63]I ain't streaming just because you didn't catch up, bro.
[114:39.67]Is that the sprinkler?
[114:44.21]A holy water sprinkler.
[114:45.48]Alright.
[114:49.84]Oh, wait a minute.
[114:56.80]Ah, I was certain it was going to be that.
[114:59.02]Damn it.
[115:09.85]We don't cancel class just because you didn't do your homework.
[115:23.51]What's in here?
[115:29.08]There are a lot of rooms in this place.
[115:30.90]Hold on.
[115:34.62]Let me just check everything.
[115:35.59]Don't get overwhelmed with the rooms.
[115:39.76]Keep it going.
[115:41.62]What's that?
[115:42.80]A book.
[115:45.71]A religious book.
[115:47.59]Okay.
[115:55.34]What is he screaming?
[115:59.77]Does it say 3DS?
[116:12.01]Nothing I can do with the fireplace?
[116:17.19]It feels like I should be able to do something with the fireplace, right?
[116:26.41]Oh.
[116:27.01]Candles.
[116:28.47]Ah.
[116:29.11]Ooh.
[116:30.33]Ah.
[116:31.01]I know where those go.
[116:35.20]I need to put some stuff in the bag.
[116:43.04]shit okay wait there's one there's another place to look no it does say 3ds yeah I'll put the candles here oh I just did it automatically the dorito
[117:13.77]Is that completed?
[117:14.47]The Von Wellenrod family seal.
[117:18.76]And that goes down to the basement door.
[117:27.59]Should I do something else with the candles?
[117:31.42]I don't think I can do anything else.
[117:38.47]So now we put that seal in the door and that should be progress, I think.
[117:43.23]There were a lot of rooms though.
[117:44.23]I'm curious if I'm going to get screwed here if I don't go to the other ones.
[117:55.16]is lay the efigi at the victim's feet brush the efigi with a hammer of justice then sprinkle the salt and pepper onto their body so they will be resurrected as the dragon king something like that
[118:37.67]Are we?
[118:38.19]This is interesting.
[118:38.91]Okay, hold on.
[118:44.24]Let's go.
[118:44.96]This is it.
[118:48.92]Why did he look at us?
[118:53.75]That was weird.
[118:59.71]He was aura maxing.
[119:12.55]He was so proud of himself.
[119:13.93]You know what?
[119:14.81]I feel pretty proud of myself as that character right there because I didn't really need, I didn't ask for any light bulbs.
[119:28.27]Okay.
[119:32.26]I don't think I can do anything.
[119:33.82]What about the, is that like a, what is that?
[119:37.60]Somebody's walking around and I don't know where they are.
[119:44.82]Okay, I just needed, I wanted to explore.
[119:46.66]Why do I hear Godzilla?
[120:05.86]A lot of doors.
[120:06.50]Let's start at the very end here.
[120:20.59]alright we've got a thing to melt oh okay okay it said melt it down and use I don't know what it said
[120:49.84]Melt it down and make the chocolate.
[120:59.00]Okay, what should I do?
[121:00.62]Did they take the ring?
[121:18.73]Yeah, we have to break something down.
[121:20.85]I think we're going to make a sword or something eventually.
[121:23.89]I don't have all the ingredients.
[121:26.68]Keep going.
[121:31.36]Try this one.
[121:41.87]Okay.
[121:42.30]Prison cell or something?
[121:48.26]That's a weird chest that doesn't open.
[122:03.24]Somebody is definitely walking around though, you hear it?
[122:13.17]Check the other side.
[122:18.94]Uh-oh.
[122:24.87]Oh.
[122:25.03]Okay.
[122:25.73]Anything to do with this guy?
[122:29.84]Uh-oh.
[122:32.73]Nice.
[122:33.69]I got an eye.
[122:36.65]A stone eye.
[122:50.95]And now it's... Alright, cool.
[122:55.81]Okay.
[122:57.78]There is one more door.
[123:04.05]And it's the one that I came in, I think.
[123:05.23]Yep.
[123:07.53]Okay.
[123:08.57]So let's go in the main door.
[123:13.32]Come on.
[123:14.84]None of those can be taken...
[123:23.11]Why is it so quiet in here?
[123:37.31]Go up.
[123:38.83]Careful.
[123:41.46]That is a broken key.
[123:43.48]Okay, so we have to go to that forge and fix the way to melt the key down and make a new key.
[123:51.93]Right?
[123:53.52]We have to add seasoning to it.
[124:12.02]New room.
[124:20.79]Why is there a cock chair?
[124:30.70]Okay, I'll tell you a quick little story.
[124:33.52]So, Holly and I have been reorganizing and doing a bunch of stuff, cleaning, getting a lot of things, just to clean up a lot.
[124:41.62]And we moved some furniture around, and this has invaded both of our psyches so much that we have a chair...
[124:51.33]Oh, let's rearrange the furniture.
[124:53.06]Let's put... Having a singular chair in a room is now... We're like, wait, hold on.
[125:00.20]That's a cock chair.
[125:01.52]Do we have that in here?
[125:02.56]That's just a singular chair pointing this way.
[125:07.19]Do we want that?
[125:08.45]I don't think... We've got to rearrange this again.
[125:11.01]Every time there's a singular chair off against a wall somewhere, it's just a cock chair now because of all that.
[125:17.46]All the times I've heard about this.
[125:27.21]You need to stop streaming.
[125:30.76]What?
[125:31.00]Why?
[125:34.28]You gotta point all the furniture at the TV.
[125:36.57]Right, but if the TV is not big enough for that space... Somebody always has a terrible viewing angle.
[125:43.26]We're trying to figure out how to get, like, a good viewing angle.
[125:45.10]We tried over here.
[125:46.64]And it's like, that chair is just facing into the room.
[125:50.87]And there's a sofa that's facing the television.
[125:54.77]That chair, I don't want that chair like that.
[125:57.79]You guys have invaded my brain.
[126:00.96]Any singular chair has become a cuck chair.
[126:05.86]If there's other furniture in the room.
[126:11.69]Every single hotel room has a cuck chair.
[126:14.17]Well, hold on, no, because it's usually at a desk.
[126:17.58]If there's a singular chair at a desk
[126:23.20]There's a desk, and that chair is a desk chair.
[126:26.36]A singular, non... There's no table, there's no desk in front of it, there's no... It's just a single chair.
[126:37.06]It's a cuck desk.
[126:38.64]You guys are making up new terms now.
[126:46.41]No, the cuck chair is the one that's usually facing the bed.
[126:49.89]Yeah, but that's a... Okay.
[126:52.46]Hold on.
[126:53.74]That's a sofa chair.
[126:55.19]That is usually a big sofa chair.
[126:57.81]That's not, I, no, no, no.
[126:59.39]I'm talking about the chair that, okay, let me give you context.
[127:03.71]That chair that I would sit in during streams.
[127:07.08]The one that was the rocking chair.
[127:10.74]It's kind of small and it's just a chair.
[127:14.06]It's not a big sofa chair.
[127:16.15]It's not wide.
[127:19.83]That thing, it doesn't work.
[127:22.02]The feng shui is just fucked.
[127:23.80]If that's in this anywhere.
[127:33.10]It's a permanent cock chair, and we don't know what to do about it.
[127:41.05]And we've had, me and Holly have had very long discussions about this.
[127:45.27]Like, where do we put it?
[127:47.14]Hmm, it's a cock chair.
[127:48.04]Yeah, what do we do with the cock chair, though?
[127:49.56]I don't know.
[127:50.86]I guess it could go in there, but then it just becomes a cock chair in that room.
[127:56.15]Yeah, I don't know about that.
[127:57.79]I don't know, maybe we should put it in the garage.
[128:01.70]There's no cock chair in a garage, you know what I mean?
[128:16.35]Let's put it in the attic.
[128:27.02]It should go in the attic.
[128:31.24]Put it in the basement.
[128:37.95]Okay, let me pay attention for a second.
[128:41.85]Now it just becomes a haunted cock chair.
[128:43.81]That's what I'm saying.
[128:44.75]You get it now.
[128:46.93]The internet has ruined everything.
[128:48.93]That, look, you see what I'm saying?
[128:50.73]That is what I'm talking about.
[128:52.76]That right there is permanently, because the internet has fucked with my head, that's a cuck chair now.
[129:01.37]It can't just be a chair in a room, and it's annoying to me.
[129:05.86]Not that annoying, I really don't care.
[129:17.30]Because then I think of some other internet brain-rotted asshole coming over and going and being like, oh yeah, let's hang out.
[129:22.85]Okay.
[129:23.81]That's a cook chair.
[129:25.15]They don't say that, but they're like, that's a cook chair.
[129:26.89]I'm an internet brain-rotted guy.
[129:28.77]And I also say that.
[129:38.17]Alright.
[129:38.71]I've got the material.
[129:39.91]I'm going to take the key to the forge.
[129:45.33]Where was the forge?
[129:52.57]Single chairs in households are now ruined.
[129:56.59]I mean, you can... I don't think... I think there's a certain demographic that would think that.
[130:04.55]Do you know what I mean?
[130:05.37]Okay.
[130:06.75]If somebody... If I had like one of my... I'm not even going to say this.
[130:09.65]I can't even say this out loud.
[130:11.40]I'm not even going to say this out loud.
[130:14.48]I'm not going to... Because it's... I'm not even going to say this.
[130:18.76]If I had somebody come over that was not internet pilled, they would just be like, oh, that's a nice chair in the corner.
[130:26.41]Do you know what I'm saying?
[130:29.93]I'm not going to breed this to life.
[130:40.00]I need that.
[130:40.59]Where's that forge?
[130:45.53]Where's the forge?
[130:48.27]I forgot.
[130:48.97]Okay.
[130:49.11]I got to pay back attention.
[130:50.14]But once I stopped paying attention, just looking over a chat and reading chat and talking to you guys, I click still in the game and I just lose place of everything that happened.
[130:58.88]Okay.
[130:59.73]This is the, I don't, this is new.
[131:12.20]I can't do anything here.
[131:18.19]Can I make a soup?
[131:21.24]Cock chair is only a cock chair if it's in a room with a bed.
[131:28.29]Can I have some of the stew?
[131:33.36]I have so much shit again.
[131:45.09]Am I making a... Did I put the eyeball in the soup, maybe?
[131:47.38]Am I actually going to make a soup?
[131:58.81]Wait, what?
[131:59.29]What's going on?
[132:12.21]Based and cuck-filled.
[132:15.15]Hey, are you going to pay your mods some kind of compensation for how many messages they had to vet in the last 10 minutes?
[132:22.86]It's alright.
[132:26.55]It's... I know.
[132:28.61]Look, if you said the word... Wait a minute!
[132:32.14]I found the turkey meat!
[132:35.88]What can I do with this?
[132:39.21]I think I'm probably going to have to make a soup or something.
[132:48.95]I don't know.
[132:49.71]There's a lot of rooms in this.
[132:51.35]I almost just said hotel, because you hotel-pilled me.
[132:59.22]I gotta fix that key.
[133:03.92]But there's a whole nother... Look at all these rooms.
[133:06.42]There's a huge hallway.
[133:09.69]Alright, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up.
[133:11.43]Let's go back up.
[133:15.77]Auto-Mod just handles it anyways.
[133:19.37]Alright, a lot of these people were eating and somebody died at dinner.
[133:25.94]Okay, that's crazy.
[133:33.77]I wonder if I can do anything with the, no.
[133:39.70]No.
[133:43.32]On the table, probably under the table, right?
[133:48.06]Oh.
[133:49.18]Bro's got a sword throw.
[133:50.28]Oh my goodness.
[134:00.24]What happened?
[134:09.31]You gonna play Dead Space before your birthday?
[134:11.37]No.
[134:16.27]This will take place at some point after I turn 40.
[134:30.04]Okay.
[134:31.14]I do know of one thing that I need to do, which I hope it is correct.
[134:35.27]And that's get back to the forge room somehow.
[134:37.61]I don't remember how to get back there.
[134:52.30]It's back here, right?
[134:54.75]I think it was this one right here.
[134:56.73]If I remember.
[135:01.46]Yes!
[135:02.02]Okay.
[135:02.40]Let's make that key.
[135:04.40]Save it here because I could softlock myself.
[135:12.80]Okay.
[135:13.28]Key.
[135:14.70]Let's melt it.
[135:15.72]Fix it.
[135:16.58]Fix the key.
[135:24.72]Shit.
[135:35.12]Shit.
[135:41.13]I need a mold for it.
[135:45.98]I'm clicking the top right corner of the light bulb.
[135:49.12]I just clicked it.
[136:00.97]Oh, uh, hold on a minute.
[136:13.09]There's a key mold that I have to put in there.
[136:26.53]You have to sit through and add first.
[136:29.10]Did you put it on the anvil?
[136:31.74]Okay.
[136:33.39]I tried to, but maybe it's a weird click.
[136:45.75]I don't think it's going to work.
[136:53.70]Okay, that didn't work.
[136:56.36]Is there another specific click that I'm missing here?
[137:00.03]You gotta click on it strangely.
[137:02.07]Really?
[137:05.36]I mean, I figured it'd be right here.
[137:14.99]The flame has to be fuel.
[137:18.45]Oh, okay.
[137:21.23]I need to get fuel.
[137:31.70]I'll just explore a little more.
[137:34.09]Was there anywhere I didn't go?
[137:35.15]I feel like I went pretty much everywhere.
[137:51.48]Fuel.
[137:57.21]There's not lighter fluid here or something?
[137:58.87]Or gasoline?
[138:03.33]Do I still have that torch?
[138:06.81]Where did the torch go?
[138:07.77]Am I crazy?
[138:10.64]Didn't I have a torch?
[138:11.88]Did I already use it?
[138:20.09]I'm going to get rid of some stuff now.
[138:22.05]I'm going to get rid of... What is this religious book for?
[138:32.84]How do you manage to complete everyday tasks IRL?
[138:36.27]Dude, if you need to ask a question about playing a specific granny-like from 30 years ago, and because I don't know where the key goes, that means I don't know how to drive a car or something, like, you need a reality check.
[139:05.75]Hates that guy.
[139:14.34]Okay.
[139:14.52]You, okay.
[139:15.63]I will say when somebody over the age of 40 says it's time for reality check, they actually are mad about something.
[139:24.56]So you know what?
[139:25.14]You got me there.
[139:25.83]You did get me.
[139:28.73]I used the older... The older guy.
[139:32.78]Now listen here.
[139:34.42]Like, you listen to me, Jack.
[139:36.18]Like, you listen here, bub.
[139:38.67]I did do that.
[139:40.13]I did just say, you need a reality check, and I wasn't fucking around.
[139:45.75]You aren't 40 yet.
[139:55.09]What about the lower door?
[139:57.35]Okay.
[139:57.55]Okay.
[140:02.31]Was there a lower door?
[140:04.58]I've been through this one.
[140:07.36]Wait, this one takes hold on.
[140:08.54]I'm getting turned around again.
[140:09.52]Wait a second.
[140:13.87]I'm going into I'm pressing I'm going to lock in mode starting now.
[140:27.42]It's no fuel in here.
[140:39.39]This is where the key goes, eventually.
[140:40.91]I need... fuel.
[140:51.35]Maybe like one of these candles?
[140:54.39]No... This is back out.
[141:05.15]I would- I don't think it would be this far back.
[141:06.81]Would it?
[141:09.41]No way, right?
[141:11.93]Or did I just not get something from one of these rooms that I originally needed to get?
[141:15.29]Very possible.
[141:26.68]Oh, hold on a second.
[141:28.41]What about this now?
[141:29.21]Can I get into this now?
[141:35.51]Do I have a way to break this open?
[141:37.65]Can I smash it with a ladle?
[141:53.62]Maybe put the stone, maybe put the eye somewhere.
[141:56.82]Yeah, I don't know.
[141:59.55]I would love to get this open.
[142:00.61]I feel like there's gonna be fuel in here.
[142:09.02]There's something I can do here too.
[142:11.10]Is that fuel?
[142:13.82]Can I get some with the ladle?
[142:22.65]Why would it want me to be able to touch this?
[142:27.03]It's gotta be something I'm missing.
[142:31.80]Seasoning.
[142:35.91]What does it want me to do here?
[142:37.77]This vial.
[142:42.14]Put the flask over there.
[142:43.26]I think this is just a healing potion, so I don't think it's going to work.
[142:46.04]Maybe.
[142:46.38]One of the other flowers.
[142:52.18]I'm clicking on the icon again.
[143:01.57]I've been holding on this for so long.
[143:05.52]No.
[143:09.24]Blacksmiths usually store the fuel for the forge pretty close, so they don't have to haul it halfway across the castle.
[143:15.79]It's going to be a specific click in that fucking room, and I just didn't click the right spot.
[143:23.67]Gosh darn it.
[143:35.70]I do agree with that person though.
[143:46.21]This game needs a reality check.
[143:56.98]It wouldn't be funny if it wasn't true.
[144:00.60]You know what I mean?
[144:05.59]Okay.
[144:05.75]Wait.
[144:05.93]Go back because I need to go to the forge.
[144:09.57]The forge is back here.
[144:13.76]I lied.
[144:19.22]That's the kitchen.
[144:19.84]I lied.
[144:20.56]It's the first door on the right when you walk in.
[144:22.25]I just wasn't locked in.
[144:31.76]Okay, it's... Oh, not this one.
[144:35.58]But wait, did I go in this one?
[144:39.71]Alright, let's go.
[144:40.49]Fuel.
[144:41.91]If I was a fuel canister or some kind of coal or something, where would I be?
[144:54.53]This thing, you can press down on it.
[144:56.06]You should be able to puff it, right?
[144:57.84]Wait, I'm in the corner.
[145:02.22]Right there?
[145:05.54]Okay, canteen?
[145:20.38]That's tipped over.
[145:30.35]Oh, this is a... I didn't even go in here yet.
[145:34.11]Hell yeah.
[145:35.67]Definitely in here.
[145:38.02]Wood.
[145:41.62]Bag.
[145:42.66]A bag of grass seed.
[145:44.77]There it is.
[145:45.35]Alright, we're good.
[145:55.26]I don't need the flail anymore.
[145:57.36]But I do want to go up there.
[146:03.08]Maybe I can't go up there.
[146:09.03]This dude's pushing 50.
[146:11.42]Technically I'm closer to 50 than I am 25, right?
[146:17.78]Think about that.
[146:19.01]I'm closer to 50 than I am 25.
[146:32.72]Okay, let's get the fuel in there.
[146:40.73]Alright, let's get the barbecue going.
[146:43.77]Alright, now light this up.
[146:48.28]Do I need a match or something?
[146:50.20]I need fire.
[146:55.10]Sulfur!
[146:56.55]This is sulfur, right?
[146:58.15]Let's go.
[146:58.61]I've carried this the whole game.
[147:05.50]No!
[147:06.79]Where did it go?
[147:09.61]Oh, thank god.
[147:11.65]I could cast a fireball at it too, I could.
[147:19.67]You've aged noticeably?
[147:22.01]I don't give a fuck.
[147:27.72]Okay.
[147:35.36]Where's my spell book?
[147:38.60]I'm holding it.
[147:39.58]Where are my keys?
[147:42.42]Oh, they're in my pocket.
[147:43.80]Ah, shit.
[147:46.43]Okay, that's math, eight, math.
[147:51.67]Let's get a fire going.
[148:01.72]Come on, dude, really?
[148:13.00]Why would I even need... I could just fireball the key until it burnt.
[148:22.66]How do I add fuel?
[148:28.86]The bucket over here?
[148:30.36]Maybe now I can just do it.
[148:43.84]Wait, I just got an oh god, oh god from VRJosh.
[148:52.31]What's wrong?
[148:56.25]Am I, am I fucked?
[148:57.47]What happened?
[149:03.06]He said you need something with the sulfur, I think.
[149:06.27]Oh no.
[149:07.47]How long ago?
[149:16.61]And is it still obtainable?
[149:19.37]I need to light the coals.
[149:20.77]But didn't I have a torch?
[149:22.32]Did I throw the torch?
[149:23.28]I threw the torch.
[149:31.37]He said, hold on a second.
[149:32.27]I'm going to have to scrub through a few walkthroughs to find it.
[149:36.78]Really?
[149:37.16]Did I really?
[149:38.86]That's not good.
[149:42.41]What am I missing?
[149:43.33]It's gotta be the torch.
[149:45.73]And I was in a hallway, and I said, oh, it's dark in here.
[149:49.68]I think I need the torch.
[149:50.62]And I took the torch out, and I don't think I needed that, and I think I threw it.
[149:56.52]It's not the torch.
[149:57.70]Oh.
[150:02.01]It's some powder-looking stuff that I just didn't pick up from, like, disk one?
[150:10.12]That's not good.
[150:22.32]There's no way I would have... Yeah, using a guide.
[150:26.51]I feel like you just have a tab open.
[150:29.03]And when you've had enough with a game like this, you just look over at the tab and be like, alright, I've spent 20 minutes.
[150:35.14]What powder did I miss on the counter in one of the gnome huts?
[150:51.19]That's so funny though.
[150:53.11]They did not care.
[150:56.04]Old games like this, old, old games.
[150:58.04]If you didn't have an item, she's like, well, that's too bad.
[151:00.16]I do.
[151:02.60]I don't even know what item it is, but that's too bad.
[151:04.20]You didn't get it.
[151:10.93]And it's funny because later on down the road, a lot of these games ended up doing a thing where if I clicked this, instead of just nothing happening, the main character in a voiceover would go,
[151:20.89]Hmm.
[151:22.45]It would be so interesting to start a fire.
[151:25.92]Hmm.
[151:26.92]If only I had something to start a fire.
[151:28.79]Right, they gave you hints by talking.
[151:41.39]What?
[151:45.16]It's a bag of Flint on a barrel at the gra- What the fuck?
[151:50.28]I gotta walk across the whole game?
[151:51.92]Oh my god!
[152:01.09]Can I even get back there?
[152:02.61]I have to go back to the starter village.
[152:06.26]Are you kidding me?
[152:10.02]Oh goodness.
[152:11.48]Okay, let's go.
[152:14.60]Get me out of here.
[152:22.91]That's the wrong door.
[152:24.07]Shit.
[152:24.63]Hold on.
[152:25.17]I can't get out of here.
[152:28.14]I can't get out of here now.
[152:29.22]How do I get out of here?
[152:30.22]How do I get out of this place?
[152:33.54]Is it a good question?
[152:40.21]Which one?
[152:40.77]Which way is it to get out?
[152:47.29]okay it's this is back in the big hallway this is the kitchen and this is the other kitchen and then I can't get out of the house okay from here it's what door is it to get out of here it's one of these right I don't remember
[153:19.83]Because this is where the, this is the prison rooms, right?
[153:22.41]Yeah, so how did I get out of here from here?
[153:34.12]Oh, it's right here, okay.
[153:37.49]Oh boy, oh boy.
[153:41.19]Okay, and then it's here.
[153:46.66]And then it's...
[153:49.15]Oh my god.
[153:52.90]I gotta go.
[153:53.72]I can't believe I gotta go back to the first screen of the game.
[154:03.63]Don't you hate it when you forget your lighter at your home?
[154:06.00]So you walk across the entire country to go get it.
[154:13.47]That is a leather jacket.
[154:15.57]That is a good one.
[154:17.49]Okay.
[154:18.93]Get me the fuck out of here.
[154:23.00]Wait, is this new?
[154:25.46]No.
[154:26.36]I thought this is where the dragon was.
[154:30.57]This was a cool thing.
[154:32.29]We get out now.
[154:33.05]We leave.
[154:37.29]I want to leave.
[154:42.82]I hope I'm not stuck in here.
[154:49.79]No, okay, we're good.
[154:56.91]Yeah... Yeah...
[155:16.63]Okay, let's go.
[155:32.08]And then we go this way.
[155:35.56]Uh-huh.
[155:42.54]Up back across the rocks too?
[156:00.82]I picked the sulfur up at the very beginning of the game.
[156:03.10]I must have just missed the Flint is what Josh just said.
[156:08.17]That's so funny.
[156:21.92]I'm gonna have to remember how to get back here.
[156:24.43]Remember when I killed that guy?
[156:46.97]This sucks.
[156:51.74]I'm not even close, by the way.
[156:55.77]And good luck if you think I'm gonna remember how to get back here.
[157:00.29]Look at all these twisting hallways.
[157:01.84]This was a whole pain in the ass to remember this.
[157:11.17]Oh shit, I don't remember.
[157:12.43]I already got lost trying not to get lost.
[157:42.30]Josh said, you hovered your mouse over it and you didn't click it.
[157:46.31]You must not have realized it was an item.
[157:50.77]Oh, dude, it actually is in the first screen of the game.
[158:16.40]We have to go across the boat again.
[158:19.97]We have to go across the whole river.
[158:31.17]This is so cooked, it's not even funny.
[158:56.90]Just walk in a straight line!
[158:58.43]I just want to walk in a straight line!
[159:00.67]Why does it have to be... Sometimes you have to go left, right, and then left and right to go straight ahead.
[159:15.57]Do I have your vote?
[159:17.17]You have been judged.
[159:18.69]Since the moment you awoke today, waited in favor of force.
[159:23.46]You have a taste for needless violence.
[159:26.96]That is why my image does not sit in the seat of decision by the dolmens.
[159:33.29]If you change... Can we see who's voting for us at this point?
[159:37.70]I'm curious if I go up here.
[159:44.22]Okay, these are the people that are voting for me.
[159:47.34]oh okay so right now I've got one two three but I got three votes because this one gets canceled out I got three votes okay that's fine
[160:18.38]Does my uncle say anything?
[160:27.11]Yeah, this is the kind of shit where you pull out of the driveway and you realize you forgot a very basic item.
[160:35.32]Like a leather jacket, like a lighter.
[160:39.22]That decision happens.
[160:42.50]It's like, oh, you hear the car turns on.
[160:46.20]I hear them pulling out of the drive.
[160:48.23]Oh, wait, hold on.
[160:48.99]They stopped.
[160:51.77]They're getting out of the front door.
[160:53.45]They're getting out of the car.
[160:54.89]They're walking out.
[160:55.62]They're coming back into that.
[160:56.40]It's been about 15 to 20 seconds since they left the room.
[161:00.82]They left the house.
[161:02.56]Oh, hey, forgot my lighter.
[161:04.71]Oh, you forgot your lighter.
[161:08.01]Make sure to get that head screwed on next time.
[161:11.58]That interaction is happening right now.
[161:13.74]It's been about three weeks.
[161:16.63]I left the house.
[161:17.81]I pulled out of the driveway.
[161:18.79]I came back three weeks later and did the... I forgot my lighter.
[161:24.80]Stupid.
[161:26.15]It's been a month.
[161:38.99]Hi.
[161:39.85]First screen of the game.
[161:52.91]Oh, no!
[161:53.93]No, no, no, no!
[161:55.57]Put it out!
[161:56.21]Put it out!
[161:56.63]Put it out!
[161:57.38]I gotta go back!
[161:57.96]I gotta go back quick!
[161:59.42]I gotta go back quick!
[162:00.62]I can't put this down.
[162:01.56]Can I put this down?
[162:04.40]Oh, shit!
[162:04.60]I gotta run across the country!
[162:07.01]Can I put it down?
[162:08.07]If I put it down, is it gonna go out?
[162:11.35]I gotta go.
[162:12.01]Wait, is it in my inventory?
[162:17.88]What do I do?
[162:19.96]Fire!
[162:20.56]Fire!
[162:24.25]Can I put it down?
[162:25.15]I can't put it down.
[162:27.23]I actually can't put it down.
[162:30.98]Hey, I forgot my hand covered in fire.
[162:41.00]Hey, good to see you, uncle.
[162:44.76]Hey, got to get that head screwed on right now.
[162:59.08]I have to leave, what if it goes out?
[163:00.60]Olympic Torch Andy, I know, I'm running around with it holding it in my hand.
[163:08.03]Am I even going the right way?
[163:08.92]No, this is the cow!
[163:18.25]Ow!
[163:19.63]I gotta get, why did I get closer?
[163:21.30]Get me outta here!
[163:29.23]That cow has... I think that cow is dead.
[163:32.36]That cow has not moved an inch.
[163:51.49]Oh, I hope this works.
[163:52.35]If I have to do this again, I'm gonna... I might just leave.
[163:57.97]Oh my god, this scared me.
[164:00.17]Don't get in front of my fire.
[164:01.53]What if I touch him and it burns him and he gets mad?
[164:15.39]I'm screwed.
[164:17.41]I'm screwed.
[164:18.93]You guys don't understand.
[164:20.01]It's over.
[164:21.27]I hope I can relight it.
[164:24.16]I have to jump over the plant.
[164:30.98]I'm screwed if I have to do that.
[164:49.36]I still got it.
[164:49.84]Okay, I'm good, I'm good.
[164:53.15]See?
[164:53.65]I'm gonna have... I have to equip the...
[164:57.35]oh fuck I still have it though right put this down uh-oh okay do I still is there still sulfur in here I'm good thank goodness
[165:19.19]Imagine if I threw this away.
[165:21.53]And I... Hey, all the people, all the backseat Andes an hour and a half ago that were like, dude, get rid of this.
[165:28.32]You don't need that anymore.
[165:29.11]You don't need this anymore.
[165:30.71]Yes, I did.
[165:31.65]Turns out I absolutely did.
[165:36.06]That's why you hoard every single item in these games.
[165:39.14]Every single one.
[165:41.92]I'm going to save it right here, but I'm going to save it in a different slot.
[165:46.29]Because I'm terrified that I've used it
[165:51.71]and nobody said that one at least one person did that's so funny imagine not knowing that I just never would have figured it out and I would have felt so stupid
[166:23.94]I would have felt so dumb that I couldn't figure it out.
[166:28.33]And I would just get people been like, Oh, I don't know, maybe should we look up a guide?
[166:32.06]I would have walked around for an hour.
[166:34.38]Okay, this is the place to get lost in easily.
[166:44.59]I think it was left, left, right?
[166:47.24]No, no, no, I think it was left, left, correct?
[166:49.60]No, it was left, left, right.
[166:51.18]It was left... It was left?
[166:53.85]Left.
[166:56.65]Right, right?
[166:58.31]I'm saying like right, like correct.
[167:04.10]Is it right?
[167:07.83]No.
[167:10.73]No, it's right.
[167:11.57]It's... Left.
[167:17.62]Shit.
[167:24.39]That was a right... How did I end up here again?
[167:45.33]Oh boy.
[167:47.50]oh dear oh boy oh lord oh that's right yes yes of course yes of course I know I knew I knew all along oh my god he leaned in and did the funny voice he leaned into the funny voice and that's why I'm a subscriber
[168:27.85]This guy's 40.
[168:30.68]What is that?
[168:34.94]What's fucking going on?
[168:37.09]What's going on?
[168:37.53]What do I do?
[168:39.49]What if I just got eaten by a fucking whale?
[168:42.64]What do I do?
[169:00.29]What the fuck just happened?
[169:01.69]Did I skip a cutscene?
[169:02.79]I think he pooped you out.
[169:12.64]Did I get shit out?
[169:20.07]Dude, you came out of his butt.
[169:22.89]Shut up.
[169:24.40]I'm 40.
[169:25.04]I can't laugh at those anymore.
[169:37.07]Oh, what a great sub sound.
[169:42.28]Thank you, too.
[169:55.94]Soupfan420.
[169:56.68]What's up?
[169:59.96]I was just trying to read somebody's name in chat that had a sub already, so it wasn't a lie.
[170:11.80]Alright, where's the other path?
[170:13.57]Alright, I'm kind of pretty much back.
[170:46.36]Where is the?
[170:47.78]Oh damn.
[170:52.05]Who did that?
[171:08.37]Now.
[171:12.04]Back on disk 2.
[171:14.73]Okay, I'm ready.
[171:19.02]I can finally progress a little.
[171:26.15]Is this the Gothmami game?
[171:27.59]Nope, different game.
[171:34.28]That was the bleakest keep.
[171:47.91]I'm so glad that I actually have the item I need.
[171:56.97]OK.
[171:58.52]So now.
[172:00.68]The correct way to go is.
[172:02.08]It was up where.
[172:04.74]I think it's this way.
[172:15.59]And then down the stairs.
[172:19.06]No shit.
[172:21.46]Why does it still want me to interact with this?
[172:23.36]Is that weird or not?
[172:24.75]You know what I mean?
[172:33.42]No, it's one of the side doors.
[172:47.22]Which one is it?
[172:47.76]This one?
[172:50.12]Is it this one here or the one to the left?
[172:54.19]Oh my god!
[172:55.36]Now this is a book one.
[173:23.05]Where is the basement door?
[173:32.53]I knew I was going to forget where it was and just not know where to go from here.
[173:38.52]Is it one of these?
[173:39.46]This one?
[173:47.94]This is the one with the dinner table.
[173:50.00]No.
[173:50.80]Why could I have clicked on every door but the right one?
[174:03.83]Which one is it?
[174:07.98]Every single fucking door is the same.
[174:09.82]Every hallway is the same.
[174:12.56]And when you click it like fucking breaks all the rules of thirds and flips you around and shit.
[174:22.13]We didn't have a map in MS Paint?
[174:25.11]It's the cuck door.
[174:31.84]It's not that one.
[174:36.58]I'm going literally insane.
[174:37.83]Is that... Wait, what is going on?
[174:47.62]I thought it was one of the...
[174:53.82]It's not through here and then out the door, right?
[174:55.86]No.
[175:04.53]Would I do a better job in real life?
[175:06.97]Yes, because when I turn my head in real life or walk forward, I don't just teleport like 40 feet in front of me and sometimes like in a different, not going in a straight line.
[175:32.77]I feel like I clicked on this door already, like three times.
[175:37.65]Change the tapestry.
[175:50.23]You see me?
[175:50.93]Okay, would you do a better job in real life?
[175:52.57]Alright.
[175:53.33]Yes, and I'll tell you why.
[175:54.44]That door is a handle I want to grab.
[175:57.10]I can't grab it.
[175:57.74]I have to turn to the right, teleport 10 feet to my left, and then... I still can't grab it!
[176:08.06]Yes, I would do a better job in real life.
[176:24.03]Now I gotta find the forge.
[176:25.23]I gotta find the hallway with the... Okay.
[176:32.56]What door is it?
[176:35.16]That's the one I came in.
[176:36.26]No it's not, is it?
[176:39.23]It is.
[176:39.45]Where's the hallway door?
[176:44.07]This one here?
[176:44.57]Oh, fuck off!
[176:51.58]Okay.
[176:52.20]Now where is the forge?
[176:57.06]I think it's this one.
[177:03.46]Okay, David, don't fuck this up.
[177:24.21]I did it.
[177:28.88]Now.
[177:39.76]This key is hot.
[177:40.84]Hot.
[177:43.18]Okay, then we need a hammer.
[177:48.39]That key is fucking huge.
[177:52.93]It's the biggest key I've ever seen in my life.
[177:57.82]Is that a fake key?
[177:59.71]Like I got a big fake check that is a real check but you don't cash that one?
[178:03.56]You know what I mean?
[178:06.10]Is this like a key to the city?
[178:07.31]How do I make this better?
[178:13.16]Just hit it with a hammer?
[178:29.62]Can I pick that up?
[178:31.52]Oh, hold on.
[178:33.60]Uh, I got a saw.
[178:36.56]What do I do with this saw?
[178:42.21]What do I do with this saw?
[178:44.61]Is that what it is?
[178:45.21]What is this thing?
[178:46.13]It's a hacksaw.
[178:51.32]I can't pick that up.
[178:56.97]I think I can pick up one of these tools, but I guess not.
[179:07.87]Oh, there we go.
[179:08.73]Okay.
[179:13.18]Then... Boom.
[179:16.80]That key is way too big.
[179:17.98]It's even in the cutscene.
[179:18.92]It's so huge.
[179:23.89]Now, how do I pick it up?
[179:24.63]With gloves?
[179:29.68]Why is there a dead bird in my inventory?
[179:31.62]Oh, okay.
[179:32.30]Hold on.
[179:40.96]I need those grips, right?
[179:53.25]Okay, so what do I... I gotta pick it up with the grips and then I gotta dunk it in the water, right?
[180:07.51]That looks like... There's like a tub.
[180:08.99]There's a tub right next to me.
[180:10.27]Where is it?
[180:13.40]Yeah, right there.
[180:14.60]I gotta pick it up and put it in the tub.
[180:19.58]Do I have anything I can pick it up with?
[180:21.23]Uh, I just got an oh no in mod chat.
[180:33.42]Don't tell me it's in the... I gotta get the water from the barrel next to the uncle?
[180:39.53]Okay, no, no, no, no, no.
[180:40.75]That's exactly what I was about to do.
[180:41.89]We're good.
[180:48.28]That's exactly what I was gonna do.
[180:57.61]Why would you do this with a ladle?
[181:13.71]Yes!
[181:15.37]We did it!
[181:15.79]It's there, finally!
[181:19.23]I can open my great-grandfather's vault.
[181:23.99]Fathers.
[181:24.71]I said that was weird.
[181:25.61]Why'd the accent come up?
[181:32.48]Here we go.
[181:34.70]That was quite a journey.
[181:43.11]Let's see what happens.
[181:49.04]And you pelvic thrusted the key in.
[181:51.15]That's very strange.
[181:51.89]I don't know why you did it like that.
[181:52.97]Why would you use your pelvis and your groin to put the key in?
[181:57.88]Did he even use a key or did he just put his dick in the hole?
[182:00.06]Do you know what I'm saying?
[182:00.78]I'm just being very honest.
[182:02.99]I have to just be completely upfront with you guys.
[182:04.87]That was weird.
[182:17.65]You notice how the key shrunk?
[182:19.55]He was a big giant foam funny key.
[182:25.90]Is there another key?
[182:27.69]OK, thank God.
[182:28.25]Get your mind out of the gutter.
[182:33.18]He pelvic thrusted into the keyhole.
[182:35.56]What do you go watch?
[182:37.53]You were just here.
[182:44.19]What the fuck did I just do to that guy?
[182:46.13]Did I just waste an item?
[182:50.98]What did I do?
[182:51.68]I just hit this guy in the head with a fucking... What was that?
[182:56.39]Do I still have whatever item that was?
[183:10.62]Why would I do that?
[183:16.12]I don't think it used anything.
[183:17.44]No, I don't think it did either.
[183:18.48]That was... Oh my god.
[183:21.04]I love this game.
[183:21.92]It's wonderful.
[183:27.35]I don't know what I'm doing that for.
[183:33.37]Do I sprinkle salt on him?
[183:34.58]Or pepper?
[183:35.08]Whatever it is.
[183:37.50]Oh my god!
[183:38.12]Oh shit!
[183:44.82]Did I save it?
[183:50.58]Save two, right?
[183:56.41]Yeah, we're fine.
[184:04.42]I'm glad we got to see that again for all the naysayers.
[184:15.52]Okay.
[184:16.28]Let me explore first.
[184:17.42]Yes, that is the... Put the effigy at the person's feet.
[184:22.05]Then smash them.
[184:22.93]Then do the salt.
[184:27.34]I don't know.
[184:27.76]It wants me to do something with that.
[184:28.80]But let me actually do that first.
[184:29.82]Because I feel like that's going to be progress somehow.
[184:35.93]There is a room to go in here.
[184:36.81]Hold on.
[184:37.11]Interesting.
[184:41.68]Interesting.
[184:52.85]Somebody in there.
[185:01.76]Ooh, spell book.
[185:07.77]It's a map.
[185:11.30]This doesn't help at all.
[185:14.20]This is the worst map I've ever looked at.
[185:16.99]This is meaningless to me.
[185:26.02]Okay.
[185:28.95]Okay.
[185:40.06]Can I open the chest?
[185:47.13]Can I talk to these guys?
[185:53.82]I think it's just the map in here.
[185:59.49]There is a chest, but I don't think it's openable.
[186:06.55]Look at that one's glowing.
[186:09.08]That armor is so pristine.
[186:11.80]Okay, let's go.
[186:13.02]Wait, what's that?
[186:21.09]Lots of money.
[186:27.46]Again, I just can't leave.
[186:29.27]I have to do the specific path to leave the room.
[186:37.10]Okay, so that was a secret little treasure room.
[186:41.81]Very cool.
[186:45.99]Let's do this.
[186:46.51]Let's see if there's anything else in one of the other rooms, though.
[186:51.48]I see whatever that is.
[186:52.40]Hold on.
[186:56.88]Am I out of inventory space?
[187:11.58]Shit.
[187:11.76]Should I just... What do I throw away?
[187:15.80]A hammer?
[187:22.09]I guess I could get rid of pretty much everything in here, right?
[187:29.46]Is there really going to be a need for me to crush up these flowers again?
[187:36.77]If you throw the map away, I feel like I'm going to need it at some point.
[187:39.96]I also have to pee again.
[187:40.78]So I'm going to do that.
[187:43.36]So we're going to get the... Yeah, I got to pee.
[187:47.34]Be right back.
[187:48.51]Give me like five minutes.
[187:50.51]See you guys very shortly.
[194:08.03]I am back, and I'm ready to continue.
[194:25.82]We're pretty far into the game, I think, at this point.
[194:27.36]I think there should be... Did it take us another couple hours to go through the rest of it?
[194:35.53]I'm here.
[194:36.35]I'm in it.
[194:39.54]I think it's interesting.
[194:40.34]I think I want to see it to completion here, but that's exactly what we're going to do.
[194:44.08]So maybe another couple hours and I'm locking in as well.
[194:49.89]So I'm going to make sure I get this done leisurely.
[194:54.25]We're leisurely locking in.
[195:01.18]Let's go.
[195:06.97]Okay.
[195:08.51]Uh, so let me do this.
[195:12.04]Right, I was trying to figure out what I could throw away.
[195:16.51]I actually might get rid of the items if I do this now.
[195:19.61]Let's go do this now.
[195:21.79]What the hell is that thing?
[195:22.89]There's an orb!
[195:24.80]Is it friendly?
[195:31.61]Um.
[195:34.37]I can smell its breath.
[195:35.81]It is disgusting.
[195:41.27]It smells like... Did I kill it?
[196:08.12]I hope I'm supposed to do this.
[196:18.44]I am effectively painting him.
[196:21.99]I'm not really slashing or striking, am I?
[196:29.06]Does that mean I'm... Oh, no, he's still here.
[196:32.36]Is he dead?
[196:48.94]Okay, well, I don't know what that was for, but does he have any items?
[196:55.29]He's just gone.
[196:59.21]Whatever.
[196:59.59]Alright, let's do this.
[197:02.56]So place this at his feet.
[197:11.95]Smash him in the head with the
[197:17.93]With what?
[197:18.91]How did I do that before?
[197:24.37]How did I do that before?
[197:38.25]I just did the wrong order?
[197:40.87]Wasn't it place the effigy at the feet, smash the head, then...
[197:55.93]Am I going to have to restart?
[198:02.22]I'm about to just take my hand and drag it across the table and throw all this stuff on the ground, by the way.
[198:15.27]I don't think I did the order right.
[198:20.56]Because I can't hit him in the head anymore.
[198:24.02]And I did before first.
[198:29.02]Let me reload.
[198:31.68]That orb is not dangerous at all.
[198:32.89]It's fine.
[198:56.85]Okay, let me take... I want to get... What did I do before?
[198:59.61]I got a couple things, right?
[199:01.96]Right, I had to go in here.
[199:02.74]Did I not save it after... What is this?
[199:07.79]This is a different room.
[199:22.85]A lot of weapons in here.
[199:33.06]I can interact with that.
[199:34.11]OK, which I put on it.
[199:48.28]Gonna hang something on there.
[200:00.03]Oh, what the fuck?
[200:01.87]What?
[200:02.31]Okay.
[200:03.09]You gotta give me a second, man.
[200:05.02]You gotta give me a second.
[200:06.72]I clicked it.
[200:07.86]I'm trying to find the place to click and something happened.
[200:15.61]It's a sword.
[200:17.08]Is that all that happened?
[200:23.95]Okay, cool.
[200:26.51]There's a second eye.
[200:31.43]Maybe I could have picked what treasure I want, depending on what skull I used.
[200:39.35]Because I don't really care about a sword.
[200:40.95]I already have a sword.
[200:44.72]Maybe I should do it again.
[200:47.62]I'm going to do it again, because I want to see what the other side is.
[200:49.65]This is the last time you're going to see this animation, by the way, because I'm saving it through the door.
[201:11.80]Okay, let's do it again.
[201:32.79]Oh, shit.
[201:36.93]You bad?
[201:39.44]Uh, yeah, definitely.
[201:46.60]He killed me in one hit, dude.
[201:48.52]Okay, well, I'm Fireballing this guy.
[202:07.68]What is Fireball again?
[202:08.60]How have I not gotten any new armor?
[202:10.16]I've had the same plastic armor since I started the game.
[202:15.96]Math ate math.
[202:17.26]Okay, got it.
[202:26.87]Math ate math.
[202:40.01]No!
[202:44.47]Oh!
[202:50.32]I just picked up... I just picked up...
[203:25.20]Come here.
[203:31.43]He's still alive!
[203:34.89]Move!
[203:36.08]Oh my god, I hate it.
[203:54.69]Swing!
[204:00.54]Okay, um... He's... What isn't even the point of the shield?
[204:19.69]How do you even hold the shield up?
[204:24.90]Can I hit him through the wheel?
[204:41.18]You can hit me through the wheel!
[204:55.14]uh okay that was weird that was weird um I don't want his club but what's in this room I picked something up over here what was it
[205:22.39]This.
[205:23.81]Okay.
[205:24.63]The teeth plier thing.
[205:28.28]I'm throwing away cloth.
[205:32.54]I'm just going to leave it in here.
[205:34.02]If I need it, I need it.
[205:35.13]Whatever.
[205:36.35]Cloth is down.
[205:37.07]I'm going to throw the... At this two-handed... I'm not going to use it.
[205:44.88]Get rid of it.
[205:48.26]What if this thing is...
[205:51.94]Maybe that's kind of important.
[205:54.56]What about this?
[205:55.06]This is my trusty walking stick.
[206:03.72]I think I'm going to throw away some of these plants.
[206:05.60]I'm going to get rid of this.
[206:09.30]Let's organize the inventory.
[206:11.06]It's time.
[206:14.63]Time.
[206:17.27]It's just time.
[206:38.50]If I need them, they're all on the ground in this room.
[206:42.12]They're alright there.
[206:54.34]Let's organize.
[206:54.96]Weapons up top.
[207:09.41]And then let's go with utility kind of.
[207:12.22]Items in the middle.
[207:16.96]Stuff that I like important quest items.
[207:19.79]But I know that I'm going to be using.
[207:25.82]Put the bag in the lower right corner.
[207:27.66]This is a health potion.
[207:28.70]I'm going to actually let's put it up here.
[207:45.91]Yeah, I killed the guy that wanted the gem.
[207:47.30]That's right.
[207:49.28]Okay.
[207:50.20]So now what do I want to put in the bag?
[207:52.58]Let's put the lint and the sulfur.
[207:58.05]And this religious book.
[207:59.39]One more thing can fit in here.
[208:04.29]I'm not going to be using this really.
[208:07.34]Okay.
[208:09.92]This is good.
[208:11.04]I have room now.
[208:11.88]I don't feel claustrophobic in my inventory.
[208:16.24]save it I'm gonna save it at four just in case something crazy happens and let's explore a little I wonder what that's supposed to do not sure
[208:47.04]That's gruesome.
[208:48.14]Okay.
[208:51.40]Can I do anything with this person?
[208:57.24]Ain't no way.
[209:02.65]That's horrible.
[209:05.55]Oh, that's the guy that's dissolving this guy in acid.
[209:19.60]I don't know if there's anything else in here.
[209:30.94]Alright, I got the grip thing.
[209:32.48]I think I can get out of here.
[209:42.13]So that's one of these rooms.
[209:43.45]Let me save it again.
[209:55.58]This is new.
[210:05.43]Up another level?
[210:07.05]This is level two, then.
[210:22.13]What's that?
[210:24.87]No.
[210:29.43]Um... I don't see anything to do.
[210:37.47]Okay, well, weird.
[210:47.18]Can I not lift this?
[210:54.25]Okay.
[210:58.36]Okay!
[211:01.93]There's whatever is going on here.
[211:03.56]Do I have anything I can do with this?
[211:14.75]What about canteen?
[211:23.19]Nope.
[211:27.91]Alright, let's check the skeletons.
[211:36.60]Whoa, I have a different skeleton now.
[211:39.66]Who's this guy?
[211:44.68]I get a lot of thunderstorms right now.
[211:46.40]A skeleton.
[212:02.92]So is this the guy we put down?
[212:11.61]put that guy down at the at this what do I wonder what we do because I can't touch this why can't I pick up that stuff that's weird
[212:44.21]It's funny rain will pass over the valley sometimes and it's just.
[212:49.02]You get it for like.
[212:50.97]It's weird to see rain in Vegas because sometimes like a pocket of it will just be like, oh, I'm just here.
[212:55.77]See you later.
[212:58.12]Or sometimes it'll rain all day for like three days and then not for a whole year.
[213:02.02]It's great.
[213:02.44]It's interesting.
[213:12.31]Same way in Arizona, yeah.
[213:14.11]A lot of these southwestern states are like this, it's crazy.
[213:22.10]Okay.
[213:30.56]So now that I have this other skeleton, I can't touch that.
[213:32.82]Maybe I can later?
[213:35.80]We don't care about that guy, he doesn't hurt at all.
[213:40.61]I gotta figure out what to do with this guy.
[213:44.26]I'm gonna save it right here.
[213:45.84]I'm gonna try this again.
[214:01.06]Okay, so... Put him down.
[214:07.62]Fuck.
[214:08.74]Is that correct?
[214:14.41]Uh, then put him down?
[214:16.01]Salt?
[214:26.29]Is that wrong order?
[214:42.03]Wrong?
[214:46.27]Was there another step?
[214:48.49]Reload, that was wrong.
[214:53.04]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[214:53.84]Yeah, I think I do it after.
[215:05.27]Okay, so let's go put him down.
[215:12.88]VRJosh, you said you were doing it right.
[215:17.73]Wait, then smash it?
[215:22.67]There's one more step.
[215:24.03]Oh, shit.
[215:24.68]Okay, hold on.
[215:34.25]I did it right.
[215:35.17]There's one more step.
[215:35.93]Shit.
[215:36.55]Right, right, right.
[215:37.15]Okay.
[215:40.70]Unless the order might not matter.
[215:42.06]What's the last step?
[215:45.13]Oh, hold on.
[215:45.69]He's coming to life.
[216:01.23]Um... Okay.
[216:10.24]The Dragon Key.
[216:14.01]Where does that go?
[216:16.39]I have the Dragon Key.
[216:18.48]Ah!
[216:37.87]That was a cool animation though, yeah.
[216:54.33]Josh said in the walkthrough they read the religious book to the skeleton.
[216:57.57]Hopefully they didn't softlock me.
[217:07.31]Be funny if it does, though.
[217:17.45]How come it's lagging now?
[217:18.59]For some reason, when you get in fights, if the person is too close, it has trouble rendering what's going on.
[217:34.47]It's a cool looking enemy, though.
[217:41.84]Oh yeah, I want to check to see my alignment.
[217:43.92]I want to see where it is.
[217:46.10]It's definitely into violence all the way at this point.
[217:50.95]See, when he dies, now I have like 30 FPS again.
[217:54.38]I want to see.
[217:54.72]Hold on.
[217:57.44]Honestly, not even that bad.
[218:03.65]That could be way worse.
[218:08.56]Okay, so I have the dragon key.
[218:17.55]Right, I wanted to do this.
[218:18.65]So which one did I open last time?
[218:20.21]There's a few choices here.
[218:22.29]I could do this one.
[218:27.90]There's two options, I think.
[218:29.70]Yeah, there's two options.
[218:31.33]This one or that one.
[218:35.43]This one or that one.
[218:39.74]This one or that one.
[218:41.40]This one or that one.
[218:45.27]One of them gave a sword and I don't really want that.
[218:52.44]This one OK, this one is this one is this one.
[219:00.97]OK, people saying this one.
[219:02.77]Is this the one I got the sword from though?
[219:08.80]Dude.
[219:11.90]It's a key.
[219:13.84]Kinda crazy.
[219:17.93]The second key.
[219:21.96]That's better than a sword.
[219:22.94]Alright.
[219:35.85]Still raining.
[219:40.46]It's raining.
[219:41.66]It's pouring.
[219:43.08]The old man is snoring.
[219:51.71]The rain.
[219:55.41]Alright, dragon key.
[219:57.06]Let's try it right here.
[219:59.70]No.
[220:01.70]What about the second key?
[220:07.57]Nope.
[220:13.98]Okay.
[220:15.83]Well, it must be for something else.
[220:19.11]Stop playing stupid games and play PUBG Mobile right now.
[220:21.76]If that wasn't a joke, you should be putting it into timeout for at least a few weeks.
[220:31.85]It definitely was because you said PUBG Mobile.
[220:34.23]That was definitely a joke.
[220:39.58]Let me do this.
[220:41.40]You get something from this, don't you?
[220:42.60]I think I didn't.
[220:44.56]I reloaded the game.
[220:47.82]Wait, what?
[220:55.39]How did I pass it?
[220:56.11]I tried to turn around.
[221:00.05]That made no sense.
[221:11.68]Okay, right, here's the map.
[221:16.13]Alright, I have keys now and I don't really know where to go with them, so... There's a dragon's lair.
[221:29.39]I have the key for it.
[221:30.93]I gotta find a way to get there.
[221:32.87]Hey, can you do an impression of my dad?
[221:34.39]Yeah, sure.
[221:38.12]Hey, I just want to say, you did a good job on your homework last night.
[221:45.40]Those math problems are very tricky.
[221:48.20]They're super tricky.
[221:49.98]When I was your age, I didn't do so good in math.
[221:56.91]I didn't do good in science.
[221:59.78]I didn't do good in English.
[222:02.20]But I said I knew my son was going to be able to grow up one day and be smarter than his father.
[222:09.53]And he did it.
[222:11.72]These C minuses and D pluses, they're just fantastic.
[222:28.64]Keep going, son.
[222:36.56]Can I do anything up here?
[222:57.60]I hear running water.
[223:08.96]Can I go in here?
[223:11.64]Where is this?
[223:12.06]I hear water.
[223:12.66]Why do I hear water?
[223:14.79]Well, I know it's raining, but I'm talking about why do I hear water in the game?
[223:24.36]I want to go in this door.
[223:31.56]There's no way to get this open?
[223:32.86]Come on.
[223:36.60]Bullshit.
[223:41.23]I should be able to go in that pool.
[223:42.59]What?
[223:52.55]Right click it instead?
[223:59.32]Oh my goodness.
[224:06.30]I thought that was a monster.
[224:10.35]What's that?
[224:12.59]A crank.
[224:14.66]Where did I?
[224:15.34]I saw that.
[224:16.04]I know I need to use that somewhere.
[224:17.82]I saw a crank hole.
[224:27.64]Probably have to drain the water.
[224:42.65]I can't open that door?
[224:44.89]No, you see, because there's... The door has about 10 to 20,000 pounds of pressure on it that you would never be able to open it.
[224:53.65]There are two doors down here.
[224:57.72]Alright, well, get me out.
[224:59.32]Let's drain the water.
[225:03.49]How do I get out of the pool?
[225:27.61]I can't get out.
[225:35.00]You can't drown.
[225:47.09]Find the pixel to climb out of the... I'm not going to get mad.
[226:03.31]EOV, you're in Big J's splash zone.
[226:07.68]That's a really fun place, I've heard.
[226:15.17]I can't get out.
[226:16.40]I cannot get out of the pool.
[226:30.80]I had to click the wall in front of me, I guess.
[226:34.25]If I clicked... Here's where I clicked.
[226:37.37]I clicked here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here.
[226:44.48]But apparently not right here.
[226:53.28]Alright, let's crank it.
[227:01.41]Where can I crank it?
[227:02.77]I need a place to put that so I can crank it.
[227:16.93]I don't know where it is.
[227:19.85]It's not here.
[227:28.50]Right here somewhere?
[227:34.47]What about there?
[227:38.70]Yep.
[227:42.83]Bleh!
[227:50.24]Pantene?
[227:58.18]You should play Megabonk.
[228:00.24]I am going to definitely play Megabonk.
[228:02.84]Just not right now.
[228:04.13]Maybe not today because I want to finish this.
[228:05.55]We're getting close to the end.
[228:07.89]Did that drain the water?
[228:15.74]It's possible that that drained the water.
[228:22.80]Hey, it definitely drained the water.
[228:29.74]But I can't open this.
[228:35.81]What's that sound?
[228:44.32]I'm bonking as we speak.
[228:45.92]It's alright for a cheap game.
[228:54.95]It looked really fun.
[228:55.81]It looked like it was going to run up my alley.
[229:02.46]Uh, this is outside of... I'm in a mountain now?
[229:13.64]Oh, shit.
[229:15.84]That's a dragon.
[229:16.64]That's a real life dragon.
[229:23.26]Blood of my blood.
[229:26.67]Our ancestors fought and died together.
[229:33.10]Your path has not been easy.
[229:36.80]With no family left, you must conquer your own castle.
[229:44.31]And I am a prisoner.
[229:48.31]The foul Diakonov had your father murdered in his own throne room.
[229:55.26]Bastards.
[229:56.12]And I was imprisoned by magic.
[230:01.28]My manservant was killed, but his soul was given no rest.
[230:08.25]My manservant?
[230:10.45]I cannot move, but I can help.
[230:15.08]Take this powder.
[230:17.48]Use it to reach the first upper level of the castle.
[230:22.40]Snort this powder.
[230:23.65]It'll make you get cracked up and you'll be able to run real fast until you crash in ten minutes.
[230:29.74]Bring my son to me.
[230:33.63]He has waited too many years in the egg.
[230:37.64]You should treat this like a star in Bari.
[230:43.51]The egg must hatch in the nest, which you will find without difficulty.
[230:51.20]To hatch, it needs great heat.
[230:55.26]The heat of the molten sphere.
[230:59.69]Okay.
[231:01.27]You must take the sphere from the castle entrance.
[231:06.64]Here is something to put the guardian dragon to sleep.
[231:13.22]To give its heat, the sphere must be broken in the nest.
[231:19.87]We gotta go to where the dragon comes down with the mouth.
[231:24.90]Alright, so.
[231:29.57]Anything else I can do in here?
[231:35.02]He's huge.
[231:44.66]Kind of looks like Big Bird's evil cousin or something.
[231:49.55]He looks like Big Bird.
[231:56.12]I gotta save it.
[231:58.22]Don't.
[232:09.94]This is a giant sword.
[232:11.70]Where'd the audio go?
[232:14.06]What is this, a lance?
[232:15.70]The Von Wallenra Dragon Lance.
[232:17.94]Okay, can I equip it?
[232:20.39]That'd be so funny.
[232:31.90]Can I not leave?
[232:36.61]Is that armor?
[232:38.29]Oh my god, that's the Von... whatever it is.
[232:42.42]The Von Wallen raw dragon saddle.
[232:46.41]Can I wear it?
[232:57.00]What about the keys that I have?
[233:00.79]The dragon key.
[233:05.08]No.
[233:10.02]What about this other key?
[233:11.30]This is the second key.
[233:18.37]Can't open this door yet for some reason.
[233:19.81]Alright, well I got a lance and I got the saddle.
[233:21.75]I'm going to be riding a dragon soon.
[233:26.10]That's kind of crazy.
[233:29.52]Why does that look weird, right?
[233:30.63]Doesn't it?
[233:35.63]Okay.
[233:47.80]So now I got the powder.
[233:52.56]Some magic powder.
[233:54.63]And then... Where's the other thing that he gave me?
[233:59.79]This thing here.
[234:01.42]Some sleeping powder.
[234:02.48]Alright, so we do the sleeping powder to the dragon.
[234:04.40]And then we can grab the sphere and break it or something?
[234:10.05]I'll try it.
[234:24.31]Anything else to the left?
[234:26.30]No.
[234:26.60]Alright, let's go try that.
[234:27.56]I'm going to see if that works.
[234:31.51]Use the sleeping powder.
[234:36.41]Turn back, earthly bloodbag, or I will destroy you.
[234:41.26]Do not come any closer, or I will destroy you.
[234:45.73]Do not come any closer, or I will destroy you.
[234:50.81]Turn away, earthling bloodbag, or I will destroy you.
[234:58.26]Guitar Warrior!
[235:00.42]I'm going to be playing that game soon, by the way.
[235:21.00]That is total distortion.
[235:39.91]I say I got to go back.
[235:40.69]Let's do it.
[235:41.85]Save it.
[235:52.67]Oh, this looks different.
[235:54.62]Look at this.
[235:57.77]Oh.
[235:59.85]Interesting.
[236:01.26]Look at that.
[236:02.36]It's the fountain all filled up.
[236:23.55]Okay, we're gonna make our way back to the entrance room, which, oh my goodness, am I ever gonna figure that out?
[236:44.38]Oh man.
[236:47.32]I should be able to open up my map and click the entrance and have trumpets play and I get a loading screen and I just appear there.
[236:59.31]I should be able to go way faster than this.
[237:03.91]Old games?
[237:04.40]I don't even like old games.
[237:12.04]I don't even like them.
[237:21.65]There's the right way.
[237:22.55]It's one of these.
[237:23.42]Is it this one?
[237:27.22]No.
[237:27.64]No.
[237:33.54]I should be able to have a Regening Mana Bar and Health Bar too.
[237:48.32]Actually, like, where the hell am I going right here, right?
[237:52.89]yeah okay there we go alright now I think it's this way it is we're gonna go back to the front do not come any closer or I will destroy you
[238:23.25]Alright, here we go.
[238:26.89]Sleeping powder.
[238:30.29]Let me save it here because I might get this wrong.
[238:44.97]Uh oh.
[238:49.01]Okay, so now can I touch it?
[238:52.32]I got it.
[238:55.72]The Molten Sphere.
[239:00.54]Put the powder on the sphere.
[239:02.61]So what do I do with this?
[239:08.42]I gotta take this to the second level?
[239:10.42]He said take the magic powder so you can get to the second level.
[239:14.65]I wonder where the... Where do I go to get there?
[239:25.58]Get the other Dragon Balls?
[239:33.50]Maybe try it on the sloped beam?
[239:40.71]I couldn't cross that, that's true.
[239:42.57]I feel like it's going to be way more specific than that, though.
[239:56.36]There was that cabinet that I couldn't get in.
[239:58.13]Maybe I can get in there now.
[240:00.05]Where was that cabinet?
[240:06.12]Maybe I can grab it with the... Yeah, let me see.
[240:08.86]Hold on.
[240:12.45]Can I actually get in there now with these maybe?
[240:19.82]What about a key?
[240:20.66]Like this key to get in?
[240:31.46]Wait, the hacksaw.
[240:36.33]You gotta be kidding me.
[240:37.41]The hacksaw's not gonna do it.
[240:41.21]Okay, well.
[240:47.70]Come on.
[240:53.95]What about just maybe the dop spell?
[241:00.86]Will it just open the door?
[241:02.06]I'm curious.
[241:15.93]No.
[241:20.23]Ladle some of the acid on it?
[241:23.30]I don't have the ladle anymore.
[241:30.76]Oh well.
[241:32.12]Well, I gotta find out what to do with this powder.
[241:34.89]He said, use the powder to get to the second level.
[241:42.12]Not very descriptive.
[241:44.92]There's also this, but I can't do anything with this either.
[241:51.09]Yeah, I was thinking maybe I could pick this up and then dump it on there if it's acid.
[241:57.84]I can't fill this.
[242:01.02]Yeah, sometimes I use powder too to get to the second level.
[242:03.99]I don't know.
[242:16.10]It's all good.
[242:21.69]I gotta try to find out how to get up, though.
[242:24.47]Where would I put powder to go up higher?
[242:28.92]Do I do the powder on the dragon?
[242:31.08]Maybe he'll pick me up?
[242:32.68]I'm gonna try it.
[242:33.92]It's just stupid enough to work.
[242:47.25]Maybe he'll pick me up if I do this.
[242:58.16]No.
[242:59.66]Alright, I just clicked the lightbulb.
[243:11.42]I figured he'd pick you up.
[243:24.63]Back where you cranked the dragon fountain.
[243:28.04]Really?
[243:30.67]Really?
[243:34.41]Really?
[243:36.07]I'll check it out.
[243:39.16]Oh my goodness, wrong way.
[243:51.65]You are dead, dead, dead.
[243:55.28]You are dead, dead, dead.
[244:00.14]Thought you were hot.
[244:01.26]Guess what?
[244:01.72]You're not.
[244:03.41]You are dead, dead, dead.
[244:07.77]Thought you were cool.
[244:08.85]Guess what?
[244:09.51]You're not.
[244:10.85]You are dead, dead, dead.
[244:14.72]Your heart has stopped and your brain is cold.
[244:18.39]You are so, so dead.
[244:21.97]And now your body is starting to... I forgot, that's some total distortion as well.
[244:27.07]You'll hear that eventually too.
[244:33.38]Now let's play the game called don't ever put this room into long-term memory because for some reason I just can't put it into long-term memory.
[244:40.76]I can't do it.
[244:42.54]And this door right here, this is what's fucking me up.
[244:46.47]This, this exact door is somewhere else in this room and it's the right one.
[244:56.81]Yep.
[244:57.05]There it is.
[244:57.41]Change the tapestry.
[245:08.18]So back in the room where I cranked the dragon.
[245:13.33]Okay.
[245:26.89]Wrong.
[245:27.67]Although I could open that case though.
[245:31.72]Hold on a second.
[245:39.53]This right here?
[245:40.67]Can I open this?
[245:41.34]I feel like there's something I could do in here that I didn't do.
[245:49.27]Oh, whatever.
[245:49.89]I don't care.
[245:55.51]If it's not going to be game progress, then whatever.
[246:04.10]Okay.
[246:04.68]Let's get back to where we were.
[246:11.17]You are so, so dead.
[246:16.70]I think it's... No.
[246:24.66]I need the double doors.
[246:29.22]There's something about these hallways.
[246:31.99]Like, this image is just this image.
[246:35.01]You know what I mean?
[246:35.89]And that image is the same as this image.
[246:39.96]They're identical to me.
[246:47.13]But you come out the side door.
[246:51.04]But the side door is... I don't know.
[246:54.86]It's weird.
[246:57.28]Check your inventory when you get a second.
[247:01.87]Am I missing items?
[247:08.89]Stop playing this shit.
[247:10.17]I love this game.
[247:11.49]I'm having fun.
[247:15.14]Remember, I'm going to play what I want.
[247:19.12]It's my decision on what I'm doing.
[247:21.96]Don't forget that.
[247:23.69]Have a nice day.
[247:38.05]Alright, staircase.
[247:48.04]It's my stream and I want it now.
[247:55.32]I just want everyone to see that's the staircase we were talking about.
[248:00.42]That's the staircase that I missed.
[248:10.82]Come on, dude.
[248:14.72]Alright, save it.
[248:24.19]I don't think it matters because you've got the items.
[248:26.07]Wait.
[248:30.34]Yeah, where is the saddle?
[248:37.16]You're saying I don't have a saddle?
[248:38.94]Did I not?
[248:39.96]Where is it?
[248:44.11]Am I wearing it right now?
[248:46.10]Oh, it's right there.
[248:47.48]Is it right there?
[248:48.08]I hope so.
[249:04.92]Wait.
[249:14.32]Here, I brought you the egg.
[249:33.47]Isn't this technically the second floor?
[249:48.59]The roof.
[249:51.14]Level 4.
[249:53.52]Level 3.
[249:56.45]Level 2.
[250:05.52]Hmm.
[250:05.62]I haven't really seen a place to put this powder.
[250:17.38]I can't get him to repeat himself either.
[250:30.70]Should I just use it?
[250:31.46]Can I jump from here?
[250:32.85]Can I do like a super jump?
[250:44.68]Ask for another hint.
[250:45.71]This game is too hard.
[250:47.31]I love us.
[250:51.68]So, okay.
[250:52.62]Some of you guys are clicking the top right of your screen.
[250:55.38]Give me a hint.
[250:56.15]Give me another hint.
[250:56.85]I want it.
[250:59.07]It's my stream and I want it now.
[251:03.74]Josh, could I have another hint?
[251:26.67]Just kickflip through the wall.
[251:31.31]The spiral staircase you couldn't go up, you might have the means to go up it now.
[251:37.40]Wait, the one spiral staircase I couldn't go up, where is that?
[251:41.93]The one spiral staircase I couldn't go up before.
[251:49.86]I feel like I vaguely know what you're talking about, but I don't at the same time.
[251:56.77]I can't wait till we get voted off the island.
[252:10.97]We're getting so close to the end, we need to see it through.
[252:28.38]Another spiral staircase that I couldn't go in before.
[252:31.05]I'm trying to remember vaguely where that staircase was.
[253:05.61]You used it to get here.
[253:10.69]The one that's all the way back?
[253:12.92]Before the regal seal went in the door?
[253:15.40]That one?
[253:23.79]Because that's the only staircase I can think of.
[253:25.79]And again, good luck getting back there.
[253:32.36]Which one is it?
[253:33.26]It's like one of these fucking doors.
[253:37.82]Can't burn it into memory.
[253:39.02]I can't.
[253:39.97]It's gone.
[253:40.63]The second that we're all out of this room, it's gone.
[253:43.37]It's just out of total.
[253:44.33]It's completely gone.
[253:52.76]Here it is.
[253:53.24]Okay.
[253:58.51]And then it would be not.
[254:00.67]Wait, is it going back?
[254:02.33]Okay.
[254:02.91]I can go up from here again?
[254:13.82]No!
[254:14.94]Do I need to drink the powder?
[254:20.60]What would that even do?
[254:21.73]Why is sprinkling magical dust on these stairs make them perversible?
[254:25.97]They didn't do anything!
[254:29.79]They were just regular stairs!
[254:32.58]Just go up the stairs!
[254:34.32]They were regular stairs!
[254:37.38]There was a force field?
[254:38.54]Just run through it!
[254:39.35]Kickflip through it!
[254:40.13]Like that one guy said.
[254:41.05]Time that person out, by the way.
[254:54.92]I'm not being mean to... I'm just fucking around.
[254:56.95]I'm just kidding.
[254:58.83]Don't worry.
[255:07.96]Interesting.
[255:08.54]So where are we now?
[255:09.76]Wow.
[255:11.81]Okay.
[255:16.63]Oh no, it's a dragon knight.
[255:24.40]How do you fireball?
[255:27.61]Hold on, let me read the manual.
[255:29.50]Oops, I just took my clothes off.
[255:58.58]Can he hit me through here?
[256:03.30]Ah!
[256:03.62]He can hit me.
[256:04.25]He can do it.
[256:04.61]He can hit me.
[256:17.25]Um, why can I... What is going on?
[256:21.23]The game's fucking closed.
[256:29.37]When was the last time I saved it?
[256:40.56]Let's try that again.
[256:44.61]Oh my god, what happened?
[256:55.26]Oh.
[256:55.68]I just had a heart attack.
[257:03.02]Let's go through this way first.
[257:13.36]Bullet room.
[257:27.00]That's a new sound.
[257:31.44]Looks like the meeting room or the war room or whatever it is.
[257:45.62]What can I do with this bird?
[258:02.47]I don't think I can do anything.
[258:11.76]It's missing its cuck chair.
[258:14.57]Well, I'm zoomed in real close now.
[258:22.29]Just threw it on the ground.
[258:27.34]Okay.
[258:27.86]Maybe I need to get a pair of scissors to snip a feather off or something.
[258:31.12]I don't know.
[258:41.83]Hallway.
[258:50.56]I eventually need to do something with this egg.
[258:56.91]Mirror.
[259:07.66]Goodness.
[259:11.49]Alright, there's a lot of doors that I need to remember.
[259:24.28]What's that over there?
[259:25.06]There's the nest!
[259:27.16]Okay.
[259:28.59]I have to get that egg.
[259:48.57]Can I go across this way?
[259:55.37]What is this?
[259:56.59]It's like a... A metal ball.
[260:10.51]There's like a little dragon kid's room?
[260:13.17]There's like little dragon toys and stuff everywhere.
[260:23.40]And that's a red bottle.
[260:27.64]Okay.
[260:32.41]Did the composer write two million songs for this game?
[260:35.58]Well, he made a lot of five to ten second loops.
[260:41.69]Which they work.
[260:42.37]I think they work out pretty well.
[260:46.67]Now where am I?
[260:56.77]The staircase.
[260:58.72]Did I hit my head on the ceiling?
[261:05.97]There's no way.
[261:06.67]I hit my head on the fucking ceiling.
[261:18.34]Save it here.
[261:26.90]What are all these pots for?
[261:28.16]Oh dear.
[261:43.10]I probably have to put something in them, right?
[261:55.20]I feel like I'm here a little too early.
[261:56.72]I don't think I can do anything with this.
[262:04.49]What?
[262:05.99]What just happened?
[262:08.41]That was very weird.
[262:09.63]That was a different... What?
[262:20.19]This place is very confusing.
[262:39.80]Okay.
[262:43.58]I'll go up the stairs again, I guess.
[262:55.51]I had to jump to get up that one?
[263:00.40]Alright, this is not gonna open without something.
[263:07.08]Shit, okay.
[263:09.29]Alright, I need something to open this door.
[263:10.36]Can I pick anything up on the ground here?
[263:22.41]Let's see.
[263:36.19]I don't think so.
[263:36.79]There's another door right here, though.
[263:39.02]Which one of these is the one I didn't... Oh, okay.
[263:42.90]There's a dragon right there.
[263:45.09]Are they statues or are they actual dragons?
[263:49.59]There's a dragon bicycle.
[263:58.12]Can I sit on it?
[264:00.37]Don't I have a saddle or something?
[264:01.53]I can't sit on that?
[264:07.60]Come on, really?
[264:13.71]It wants me to get up there and sit on it so bad.
[264:15.49]And I want to sit on it so bad.
[264:16.65]Oh, hold on.
[264:30.95]This one doesn't have... Whatever it is.
[264:49.14]I don't know.
[264:59.46]This is the pot room.
[265:02.29]This is the way to go back down.
[265:03.73]Alright, there was a... Watch out for this, because if I hit my head again, what if it falls?
[265:10.14]It looked like it was wiggling around.
[265:22.74]Am I gone?
[265:24.22]Okay, this is... Where was that skeleton?
[265:49.35]This place is huge.
[265:50.19]I'm going to get lost here.
[265:54.79]I already am lost.
[265:55.69]What am I talking about?
[266:02.22]This definitely is one of those games where you have to draw a map in MS Paint.
[266:10.21]And the map that I have is kind of drawn in MS Paint already.
[266:15.20]Let me see it.
[266:19.83]This is not helpful.
[266:22.66]I think I like where like a Tetris piece.
[266:51.25]Did I even go in here?
[266:52.77]I did.
[266:53.05]Alright, so this is back out here.
[267:00.30]This is where I want to be.
[267:02.35]Save it because I want to bite this skeleton out here.
[267:14.49]Don't die to the skeleton.
[267:15.67]So give me a weapon.
[267:16.61]I have... The book is not going to cut it.
[267:20.51]Give me this thing.
[267:21.95]Alright, get over here.
[267:28.02]Can I actually not go down?
[267:34.45]Why am I not swinging?
[267:36.35]Okay, I think he's stuck here, which is good.
[267:46.84]Alright, nice.
[267:54.36]So what is in here?
[267:56.35]What do you got?
[267:56.85]Nothing.
[268:09.06]Okay, there's only one door.
[268:12.64]Yeah, I'm trying to focus because I'm trying to know exactly where I am.
[268:18.47]Look at the even back in the medieval times had pizza art for like the kids room.
[268:24.70]That's cool.
[268:41.14]No items in this room?
[268:43.04]No way.
[268:44.41]I refuse to believe it.
[268:56.97]Really?
[268:57.35]There's nothing in here?
[268:58.67]Whatever this is, can I put something in here?
[269:00.27]A metal piece?
[269:05.74]That looks like it's perfect, right?
[269:12.57]There is an item.
[269:13.52]That's the hint.
[269:17.16]Oh.
[269:26.30]okay you have to fit it in all the circles what you have to fill in all the circles with what though
[269:53.74]I feel like this is just a painting and we don't need to do this.
[270:02.57]Did I miss an item in here?
[270:03.69]Is there actually an item in this room?
[270:08.06]Oh my goodness.
[270:09.74]Hey, look at that.
[270:12.68]Okay, so this is... What is this?
[270:13.69]Another metal ball?
[270:14.81]Metal ball?
[270:15.81]I have two metal balls.
[270:20.88]What do I do with the metal balls?
[270:26.86]Where do they slot in?
[270:33.81]I have two of them now.
[270:38.44]Let's freaking go.
[270:39.70]Need to find the metal scrotum.
[270:57.32]You know, I wish a game would do that.
[271:00.61]That'd be really funny.
[271:05.34]This is going back down.
[271:06.06]I don't want to go back down.
[271:12.13]I'm glad I have... Maybe I need both.
[271:14.59]Blot in.
[271:19.18]The stream has been off, but what?
[271:20.90]What?
[271:23.26]Stream has not been off.
[271:24.46]Why?
[271:24.68]Because I talked about a cuck chair and we laughed about it a little bit.
[271:42.62]Alright, what do I do with these balls?
[271:51.96]Oh, there's an item over there.
[271:55.88]What is that?
[271:59.70]A twig?
[272:03.09]A twig and the two balls?
[272:07.68]What do I do with that?
[272:26.19]I don't do anything with this.
[272:27.41]What do I do with this bird?
[272:33.58]There's something under the bird.
[272:34.74]The bird is... You zoom in on it.
[272:41.74]See?
[272:41.94]Look at it.
[272:42.28]Why is it... Why does it want to be under here?
[272:57.84]Uh, I'll click the hint thing.
[273:02.17]I'm curious.
[273:09.46]Wait.
[273:10.92]I just spun the bird around.
[273:20.59]What?
[273:21.63]That was weird.
[273:26.48]You're almost 40 and you're still doing dick and ball jokes.
[273:32.85]What is that?
[273:41.65]What does it want me to put there?
[273:42.71]See the two arrows?
[273:45.01]Quig?
[273:51.96]Oh, he's a raunchy comedian.
[273:54.79]I've seen him.
[273:55.61]He's a raunchy comedian.
[274:01.88]I don't know.
[274:09.23]It is weird that I can click on this with something.
[274:11.27]...
[274:22.88]There's more to explore.
[274:23.80]You haven't found everything.
[274:24.98]Okay.
[274:37.37]There was a place where I could see the egg in the nest.
[274:41.92]I want to get over there.
[274:49.31]Okay.
[274:51.78]I can't open that chest, I've tried it already.
[274:56.51]It's right here, ready?
[274:57.49]I go in here and look and look at it.
[275:03.24]How do I get over there?
[275:04.78]It looks like it's right there.
[275:12.06]You know what I mean?
[275:12.57]It looks like it's right out this door and then straight ahead.
[275:19.31]Do you have a rope?
[275:21.15]I don't think I have a rope.
[275:26.57]I've got a twig.
[275:27.57]I've got balls.
[275:35.32]Wait, I do have a rope.
[275:40.39]That sucks.
[275:41.13]I really thought it was going to work.
[275:47.63]Damn it.
[275:48.54]Too bad.
[275:51.77]There's rooms I haven't entered up here.
[275:54.80]OK, I'm just going to explore them.
[276:04.49]Let me check that other side.
[276:05.33]OK, this is the only two rooms here.
[276:20.34]Go straight across this one.
[276:24.33]Does that... Yeah.
[276:26.87]I hate when they put a door right next to you here.
[276:28.93]You just get so confused when you come back out of it.
[276:41.11]It's so difficult to remember where you even are going.
[276:43.67]These old Myst-like point-and-click games, it's...
[276:50.35]I always had trouble with the backtracking and knowing like what hallway led to what room and what room needs to be gone into because what door is the right door and.
[277:03.32]Like where you are spatially even in the house.
[277:08.91]I don't even end up doing that.
[277:18.24]Because I feel like there's going to be one door up here that's in a weird navigational spot.
[277:23.83]That is where I have to go.
[277:34.01]And we've seen where... Oh, I had to go down that staircase.
[277:37.05]And the staircase was... I didn't even know there was... It didn't even look like a staircase.
[277:44.44]What about through here?
[277:48.89]I mean, that's where the skeleton was.
[277:50.39]We already were up there.
[277:51.33]I could go up, but I don't think that does anything.
[278:01.46]Was that... Did I go up?
[278:17.81]I actually might draw this out.
[278:22.28]Because the hallways are long.
[278:23.46]They lead to longer areas with bigger... Like this here.
[278:26.12]There's a hallway here.
[278:27.57]I think I'm going to draw this out.
[278:34.44]I haven't been here yet.
[278:35.70]And I guess I just found it.
[278:39.34]You see what I mean?
[278:40.70]What door did I come out of?
[278:42.60]This is where it gets confusing.
[278:43.88]It's like, oh, here you are.
[278:44.66]You came into this room.
[278:46.87]There are two doors behind me.
[278:48.55]It's like, fuck, which one of these did I even walk out of?
[278:50.63]And who the fuck is this little guy?
[278:57.14]Master, take me, Master.
[279:05.11]Let me help you.
[279:07.35]Let me give you the power to wreak revenge on your enemy.
[279:13.20]I can help you, master.
[279:16.24]I can send you to a place where only you may go.
[279:22.41]A secret place.
[279:25.66]I can send you there and help you leave when you
[279:33.73]I require two metal balls.
[279:36.39]Master, will you help me a little?
[279:41.96]Yes?
[279:43.26]What I ask is very simple, Master.
[279:47.32]There is a balcony on this floor.
[279:51.95]A balcony that is a nest for dragon's eggs.
[279:58.17]Take me there and put me down.
[280:02.89]He sounds drunk.
[280:05.11]He probably is.
[280:06.46]I actually picked this guy up.
[280:24.60]I did just try to throw him over the balcony.
[280:26.18]Let's just be very clear.
[280:27.04]I just tried to right-click to throw him overboard.
[280:30.11]It didn't work.
[280:30.95]I guess he fits in my...
[280:33.15]That's weird.
[280:33.75]I don't like that.
[280:35.47]I don't like this.
[280:39.58]That's a creepy weird way for you to be carried.
[280:47.77]Alright, what do we got?
[280:48.77]This is where we just were.
[280:51.01]Beds.
[280:53.13]Anything with the beds I can do, no?
[280:57.86]And yeah, where did I put him?
[281:08.75]OK, but then which which door did I come out of?
[281:14.50]That's a third ball.
[281:18.38]Is there another ball to find?
[281:22.61]How many balls do I need?
[281:25.33]Now that is that's not only a culture, that's the ultimate culture.
[281:30.16]You told me it's only in rooms with beds and only in bedrooms.
[281:34.14]That is a stadium seating culture.
[281:40.60]You want a good view of all the action.
[281:46.21]That's a Monday night football cup cheer.
[281:55.75]Okay, let's try this one.
[282:05.25]bones on the ground oh I don't like that I don't like that that means there could be something in here that's going to what is that what is that what is this I think that was a phoenix familiar
[282:33.80]Should I shoot a fireball at the bird?
[282:52.09]Wait, what's it saying?
[282:54.73]This is saying...
[282:56.86]The bird.
[282:57.62]Above the bird, there is a key above the bird's head.
[283:02.94]And above that, there's a second key.
[283:05.13]And above that, there is a knot.
[283:07.75]And above that, that's what you gotta do.
[283:22.61]I don't get it.
[283:23.80]But it's okay.
[283:24.76]We'll figure it out.
[283:33.02]I can't pick up the bones?
[283:37.35]Did he do a Jim Leahy impression?
[283:39.41]He probably says something like that.
[283:50.77]Ow, my fucking back!
[284:02.92]I didn't say anything!
[284:04.50]That was an impression where I, okay, I've learned a lot of things about it, my impressions.
[284:10.05]My impressions usually start with saying the name of the character, which I didn't really do there.
[284:14.48]Say the name of the character.
[284:16.72]Like, ah, it's Jim Leahy, for God's sakes.
[284:19.48]You know, what does Jim Leahy have to say about this?
[284:21.39]I start usually by announcing that the person is doing, that you're announcing who you are.
[284:26.51]And then you just say filler words.
[284:28.03]You don't even actually say a sentence.
[284:29.32]You don't say anything that they ever actually said.
[284:32.06]You mention a character that's in the show because they would be interacting with that character.
[284:36.91]I don't actually ever say anything.
[284:39.63]It's a safety net impression.
[284:41.28]That's right.
[284:45.10]I don't say actually anything.
[284:47.02]I just announce who the person is by telling you in third person who they are.
[284:50.15]And then I say five filler words.
[284:54.56]uh Goku uh it's me Mr. shane yeah uh Jesse Aaron yeah well it is what it is okay I'm 40 tomorrow or whatever you know what I'm doing whatever right it's my stream and I need it now okay how many times am I gonna say that today if it's it's my Goku
[285:23.48]Okay, I've got some new things.
[285:25.59]I've got three balls.
[285:26.61]I've got this weird guy.
[285:27.81]I'm going this way.
[285:33.90]What do I do with the bird?
[285:38.12]The key above you.
[285:40.14]Fireball, right?
[285:42.02]Let's try shooting.
[285:42.43]I'm going to shoot a fireball at it.
[285:44.47]That's what I would do.
[285:54.08]That didn't work.
[286:10.40]Nothing to do with the balls.
[286:15.07]That paper was really not that helpful either.
[286:17.07]It said, hey, there's a key above it and there's something above that key.
[286:20.03]Maybe I have to go up and do something above?
[286:26.59]I don't know.
[286:30.74]I'm clicking the light bulb in the corner.
[286:34.74]Because I'm kind of back where I was before.
[286:36.10]The hacksaw is the key to reaching the egg.
[286:59.59]You mean I have to cut something down on that balcony?
[287:04.45]How would I have reached?
[287:09.30]I wouldn't be able to reach this.
[287:12.43]That's where I found the little weird guy.
[287:13.57]Hold on.
[287:25.24]The hacksaw is the egg to reaching the ball.
[287:32.05]Alright, well, let's go.
[287:33.15]How do I use it?
[287:55.58]Shit.
[287:59.03]I can't cut that down.
[288:00.29]I can't throw it.
[288:01.11]I can't.
[288:04.79]I think I can cut... Wait, wait, wait.
[288:07.74]Hold on.
[288:09.12]Somebody said it in chat and I think you're right.
[288:14.85]Oh my god!
[288:15.89]This is... What is this?
[288:19.94]A prison break game?
[288:21.20]This wouldn't even work in medieval times.
[288:23.62]They didn't have saws that was that sharp enough.
[288:27.25]Now what do I do?
[288:28.51]I need this... I've dropped a little weirdo here.
[288:45.76]I said, go get my son.
[288:48.87]Please.
[289:08.61]Oops.
[289:11.78]Metal ball?
[289:21.49]It's a fire orb.
[289:26.56]Oh, shit.
[289:30.85]Okay, fire orb is in.
[289:32.59]Let's hatch it.
[289:40.85]I put this little guy down?
[289:57.18]Okay, I can't put him down.
[289:58.38]Alright, what if I break the orb?
[290:06.27]With a hammer?
[290:14.81]Dragon lance.
[290:24.70]Uh-huh.
[290:26.26]Take the liquid.
[290:27.76]The red liquid.
[290:33.97]Take the... I hate this guy.
[290:38.92]Help!
[290:39.22]Do something!
[290:39.94]Help me!
[290:40.40]Dip the stick in and use it as delicious fondue.
[290:53.56]It's got to be something with this.
[290:58.38]Metal ball into... What do I have in the sack?
[291:02.93]Sulfur.
[291:04.59]Get the ring.
[291:07.32]Fire.
[291:08.42]Wait, what if I... Hold on.
[291:14.93]Check it out.
[291:20.49]Can I not make fire anymore?
[291:34.61]Whoa.
[291:36.84]Oh my god, it's coming out!
[291:53.64]Does it imply that I have him in my inventory?
[291:56.78]Where is he?
[291:58.64]I don't want to put the little weird guy down until I'm certain that I did that correctly.
[292:07.47]Okay, let's put the weirdo down.
[292:14.64]What's this guy's deal?
[292:18.71]He said, bring me to where the eggs are and I will show you a secret.
[292:22.69]Please.
[292:23.51]We're here.
[292:34.07]Nothing to miss him.
[292:34.83]Oh, no.
[292:43.89]Right-click him.
[292:48.01]Yeah, I'm trying to put him down next to the egg.
[292:49.59]I can't really place him.
[292:58.51]Throw him off the edge.
[293:03.09]This balcony, he maybe... Oh, hold on.
[293:05.68]Does he want to hang out right here?
[293:08.88]Why is the egg there again?
[293:15.78]It's like the cow at the start.
[293:16.80]It should be on the left of your screen right now.
[293:19.11]Oh, that's not good.
[293:20.61]I think it should be fine, though.
[293:25.52]What about this, though?
[293:27.38]Can I can I click by?
[293:28.50]He said bring him to the balcony thing, but he doesn't want to get out.
[293:43.32]I really don't want to leave here until this is certain done.
[293:55.02]Imagine this was the cursor.
[293:56.26]That'd be great.
[294:00.20]In the walkthrough, they just dropped the imp guy on the floor.
[294:02.69]I can't drop him on the floor.
[294:08.19]Weird.
[294:08.41]Weird.
[294:14.81]Kind of where I was clicking right there.
[294:16.03]Maybe it's bugged.
[294:30.26]They just yeet him into the hallway right when they get him.
[294:38.39]Stop looking at walkthroughs.
[294:39.17]You're ruining the experience the game devs had in mind.
[294:43.36]Um...
[294:45.84]I'm having fun.
[294:48.27]And... Some of the stuff is very hard to figure out.
[294:52.63]And both of my parents would have walked out of the room and I would have had to close the game and never beat it.
[295:00.20]I'm playing it just to have fun.
[295:01.73]I don't... I want to see the fun cutscenes.
[295:06.99]I want to see the goofy dialog.
[295:10.04]I'm figuring some stuff out on my own.
[295:12.14]We're doing it collectively as a group.
[295:16.91]But for instance, when... I'm apparently supposed to be able to click them here and I can't.
[295:22.46]That's why... I only really do walkthroughs like this for games like this.
[295:29.20]That are old and crunchy and hard to follow and hard to understand.
[295:37.11]Maybe reload the game?
[295:41.96]Yeah, let me put them away.
[295:46.27]I'm going to put him away.
[295:48.37]Let me reload the game, actually.
[295:50.34]Hold on.
[295:53.00]Which one was that?
[295:53.52]Three?
[295:58.58]Okay.
[296:07.11]Maybe because I put the thing down first, I can't do this now?
[296:30.69]Because he should... This dragon's supposed to be on the screen.
[296:35.33]And he's not.
[296:36.11]He's supposed to be right here, apparently.
[296:38.15]And I think it's messed up.
[296:39.42]Maybe because I wiped the book out?
[296:40.76]Let me put the book away.
[296:47.35]Hmm.
[296:50.65]I really want to see the end of this guy's little arc here, though.
[297:01.18]Oh well.
[297:03.66]Now I go back to the dragon.
[297:06.73]And I just... Here's your son.
[297:15.40]We got 95% of people using a guide.
[297:19.60]Yeah, we're just having fun.
[297:20.91]I'm just hanging out.
[297:24.19]I'm challenging myself as much as I would like to for fun.
[297:29.36]That's all there is to it.
[297:34.91]There's plenty of puzzle games that I would not use a guide for, but they really do get so specific on these that without them, let's put it this way, on stream without them, this would end up being like a challenge that would last a long time, I think.
[298:01.02]Read Josh's message.
[298:02.34]Wait, what did you say, Josh?
[298:06.42]Try unequipping the shield.
[298:09.74]Oh, that might be a problem.
[298:16.07]No.
[298:19.28]Alright.
[298:20.14]I hope when I go talk to the dragon, everything's fine.
[298:26.31]And then we get to continue.
[298:37.89]OK, now to get back to Dragon.
[298:39.81]It's.
[298:43.52]Oh boy, let me think.
[298:46.46]Alright, they get back to Dragon.
[298:47.46]You have to do.
[298:52.61]Um?
[298:55.76]I don't remember.
[298:56.22]Down and then up, right?
[299:04.37]So I gotta get instead of up.
[299:05.27]I gotta go down.
[299:09.56]Come on, go.
[299:11.47]Go!
[299:19.38]Okay.
[299:31.76]I fucked it up.
[299:48.11]Okay, let's go.
[299:50.03]Please don't be broken.
[299:51.47]Please don't be broken.
[299:52.33]Please don't be broken.
[299:58.38]Please don't be broken.
[300:02.05]Please work.
[300:06.82]And... Yes!
[300:11.93]We're good.
[300:15.63]That's it?
[300:16.53]What do you mean?
[300:20.76]Where's my quest completed?
[300:32.71]if you want to go there give me an object you have touched an object you have touched well um I have a lot of those I've touched these a lot you know I've touched my balls plenty of times hundreds of times in this playthrough so I guess
[301:04.33]I feel like I want to give him... Should I give him like a hammer or something?
[301:12.48]Maybe this?
[301:14.90]Wait, what if I just give him this little weird guy?
[301:16.56]The secret chamber holds power for you.
[301:25.45]And also great danger.
[301:28.44]You must find your own way out.
[301:34.28]Oh, shit.
[301:41.16]Unless, of course, you're streaming with 8,000 people watching and a group of moderators that have a walkthrough of the game up that can tell you exactly where to go and what to do, which is precisely what's going to happen in five minutes when you don't know, and this is where the three balls show up.
[301:59.66]I thought I was an indent in the wall to put free balls.
[302:03.53]I just got so mad.
[302:05.01]That was an indent 123 and a red button.
[302:09.56]Shit!
[302:13.77]Teleport spell.
[302:19.54]Really?
[302:30.07]I'm not going to use it yet.
[302:31.19]I've got to save.
[302:46.79]I hope that little guy is doing alright.
[302:52.62]Potions?
[302:55.42]What is this?
[302:56.60]I don't want to drink it.
[302:57.18]I just want to look at it.
[302:59.98]Daikonov's blood.
[303:01.44]Alright, we got this dude's blood.
[303:12.28]That's all that was up here.
[303:13.30]That's it.
[303:19.67]This guy keeps a container of his blood up here.
[303:21.65]Why?
[303:21.75]Why?
[303:33.93]I guess I'm just going to teleport now.
[303:38.63]Which, what was it?
[303:39.25]It was... Take a sip.
[303:45.80]It's probably gross.
[303:48.80]Alright, this is Math Olympics Flower.
[304:02.52]Am I picking where I want to go?
[304:10.09]What does that mean?
[304:38.96]Does it want me to go all the way back down?
[304:47.15]OK, so.
[304:51.37]Should I go into the basement?
[305:00.51]OK, I've got this guy's blood.
[305:01.89]I got three balls, his blood.
[305:06.63]A vial, red vial.
[305:13.56]That's kind of where I'm dumped.
[305:15.19]I don't know.
[305:16.23]I'm done.
[305:18.50]Now I've got to go smash that vial of blood in his head.
[305:22.53]I don't know.
[305:23.41]What's the next step?
[305:24.63]And nobody told me what to do next.
[305:29.16]He just said, thank you.
[305:30.48]There's a secret that you're going to be looking at, and it's a guy's blood.
[305:33.90]You figure it out.
[305:35.78]You're on your own.
[305:36.77]That's what he told me.
[305:37.53]He said, you're on your own.
[305:38.79]You do it.
[305:47.65]Can I go talk to that guy?
[305:48.95]That Daikonov?
[305:58.45]Maybe I'm just done in this whole zone.
[306:09.07]Can I get another vision if I pour this or something?
[306:16.99]Didn't you kill that guy over cloth?
[306:18.59]Oh, that was a different guy.
[306:30.45]He killed your dad with his blood on a snake charm.
[306:33.15]Yeah.
[306:35.52]I guess I just don't know what the... the natural progression from that quest being done.
[306:42.67]I guess maybe I go find him?
[306:44.87]Was he walking around somewhere?
[306:48.18]The hint button just lit up.
[306:50.54]Alright, I clicked it.
[306:54.26]Just the zone.
[306:54.96]Just the zone I want to go to.
[306:55.95]It's definitely the... You were right about the bird and fire.
[307:08.64]Just use the wrong fire.
[307:17.74]So okay.
[307:23.65]Alright, let's teleport.
[307:25.91]I'm so glad I have fast travel now.
[307:27.42]It's great.
[307:41.04]Where was the bird?
[307:41.98]It was bird level 2.
[307:48.49]Whoa.
[307:54.66]This is crazy.
[307:55.80]What is this?
[307:56.90]Is this disk one?
[307:57.70]I didn't want to click that.
[308:11.44]I think it was level two.
[308:23.20]Maybe level 3?
[308:33.87]No, I think it's level 3.
[308:38.02]Or level 4 even.
[308:41.42]I'm so happy that I have this now.
[308:43.00]It's amazing.
[308:43.72]I don't have to walk around in circles like an idiot anymore.
[308:48.95]What?
[308:49.09]How come I don't have access to level 4?
[308:52.14]I don't have access to anything.
[309:01.61]I can only do level... Wait, this is negative two.
[309:06.32]Can I not go up?
[309:07.80]Wait a minute.
[309:13.09]Now I can teleport in circles like an idiot.
[309:14.89]Well, I guess let me just go.
[309:16.23]Whatever.
[309:19.62]I gotta go back out.
[309:21.16]Hold on.
[309:24.20]So I can't teleport up, I can only teleport down.
[309:26.59]I can't do level 3, 4, or the roof or 5.
[309:31.98]Hold on a second.
[309:43.42]I'm not softlocked.
[309:44.26]I was gonna... The bird... I will get to the end of this game.
[309:50.57]The bird was in the castle with the balcony and shit.
[309:54.60]It was underneath that.
[309:56.83]And to get there I had to go up the stairs from the spiral staircase.
[310:02.11]Which the spiral staircase is the basement.
[310:05.92]I'm going to the basement.
[310:13.21]I want to go up turn the page turn the page what are you doing
[310:53.27]I didn't know I wanted to turn the page!
[310:55.19]Stop telling me I wanted to turn the page!
[310:59.88]You're wasting my fucking mana!
[311:01.64]Oh my god.
[311:14.86]Bingo.
[311:19.41]I didn't even know you could flip the top page.
[311:23.96]Alright, let's go.
[311:24.68]Bingo.
[311:25.81]Check it out.
[311:26.43]Watch this.
[311:30.85]Boom.
[311:32.59]Give me fire in my hand.
[311:39.54]Boom.
[311:42.71]No.
[311:43.01]Oh, it's not fire.
[311:48.85]It's not this fire.
[311:54.34]Shit.
[311:57.32]Maybe I have to go underneath him?
[311:59.22]Get closer, maybe?
[312:23.66]Oh!
[312:23.80]Oh!
[312:26.82]Where did it go?
[312:31.35]Where did it go?
[312:32.05]What happened?
[312:41.73]It disappeared.
[312:45.21]It disappeared.
[312:51.84]No, actually, I clicked on it and it disappeared.
[312:55.80]It opened up the holes.
[313:04.63]Oh, okay.
[313:06.45]I need one more.
[313:07.45]I need one more stupid orb.
[313:09.30]How many ore?
[313:10.58]I need one more orb.
[313:11.66]Where's this last orb?
[313:22.47]I'm going to go crazy.
[313:23.49]Where's the last orb?
[313:35.05]And the orbs could look like that on the table.
[313:38.69]In fact, it might just be that on the table.
[313:42.50]I've no idea where the other orb is.
[313:45.46]Shit, where's the last orb?
[313:51.29]It's somewhere just lying around this house somewhere.
[313:54.01]It's going to be on a windowsill or... Shit, I thought I was right there.
[314:03.53]It's not under the Omega Stadium seating cut chair.
[314:06.92]It's not under the regular less pay-per-view cut chair.
[314:12.17]Because this one costs more.
[314:14.61]I guess.
[314:23.03]Where is there a sphere?
[314:34.13]-2, we get it.
[314:38.65]I'm just trying to make a call back to something that everybody loves when I talk about.
[314:46.27]Was it actually right there?
[314:47.19]What do you mean?
[314:47.71]Was it really?
[314:54.40]It's right there.
[314:55.24]Turn around.
[314:55.92]Are you serious?
[314:59.94]Where?
[315:02.07]I don't see it.
[315:09.80]It's under there.
[315:10.92]Okay, alright.
[315:19.21]Where have I not... It has to be in this area, right?
[315:23.26]Potted plant or something?
[315:25.20]What about the mirror?
[315:29.40]No.
[315:37.47]I can't open that chest, so I don't think it's in there.
[315:48.26]Where is this thing?
[315:51.51]Not there.
[315:56.22]It's gotta be in that room full of pots, somebody's saying.
[315:58.97]I feel like I got one from there already, didn't I?
[316:20.14]Why do I feel like it's in here?
[316:38.53]Okay, I just saw Josh Omega lulled, which means I definitely am not in the right spot.
[316:48.96]I got it.
[316:49.52]It's right there.
[316:52.99]There it is.
[316:55.33]I found it.
[316:55.91]Okay, that was just part of the plant, honestly.
[316:57.49]Let's go.
[317:08.63]Let's finish this up.
[317:11.18]Hell yeah.
[317:13.02]I am so excited.
[317:18.41]What happens?
[317:18.97]Flush this one down the toilet.
[317:30.68]And... you got me... a... Uh... What the fuck is this?
[317:44.84]Sorry, I just got really annoyed.
[317:50.38]A talon attached to some string.
[317:53.15]Now I have to go above?
[317:54.19]I think I now have to pull the key up, right?
[318:04.58]That's what it looked like in the video.
[318:07.75]And when I say video, I mean the picture, the drawing that was on the table.
[318:14.04]It looked like it was hanging above and I could pull it up.
[318:20.54]video he's exposed no no guys it's not me looking at the video it's a mods of looking at a video of a walkthrough I am cheating with a video by proxy right so that's fine he watched the full playthrough no I just I said video because I'm stupid
[318:45.97]In the picture, it looked like I could pull it up, so I'm gonna go above here.
[318:50.74]Let's get the teleport spell, because I'm too stupid to find my way up.
[319:03.76]I can't even teleport up.
[319:07.60]That's dog shit.
[319:13.91]There was a staircase I could go up though, wasn't there?
[319:20.95]OK, let's go up here.
[319:21.99]Isn't this locked though?
[319:24.28]I feel like this is locked.
[319:26.52]This is why I bumped my head.
[319:33.49]Alright.
[319:35.97]Now.
[319:40.16]Where the hell am I?
[319:45.98]I can fish it through here somewhere.
[319:53.47]What does the video show?
[319:54.57]I don't have a video of it.
[320:00.98]Let me take the talon out.
[320:02.12]I feel like it's going to be somewhere in here.
[320:08.52]There's probably a hole in the ground I can see.
[320:12.58]Or maybe I use this on one of the pots.
[320:15.03]That would make sense.
[320:23.31]Now he has to make it look like he didn't see the video.
[320:28.13]Yeah, I have to fumble around a lot to make sure you know that I didn't see the video.
[320:34.30]Um, what is that?
[320:39.75]What is that?
[320:40.17]I don't know.
[320:46.98]It's definitely this.
[320:47.60]100%.
[320:54.69]And I'm just going to pull it up through the... Oh my goodness.
[321:00.44]I don't know.
[321:01.48]There it is.
[321:02.18]I knew it.
[321:02.90]Yep.
[321:03.72]Boom.
[321:04.60]Bingo.
[321:06.09]Yank.
[321:09.29]Now I can go all the way up.
[321:12.23]We are cooking.
[321:16.32]Hold on.
[321:16.58]Let me just close this video real quick.
[321:20.72]Okay.
[321:21.18]Video is closed.
[321:23.47]Close that tab.
[321:33.79]So now there's another staircase I can go up, right?
[321:35.90]Where is it?
[321:42.05]Puke, puke, puke, puke, puke, puke, puke, puke.
[321:45.88]There it is.
[321:49.69]Alright, I'm saving.
[321:54.85]This is progress.
[321:55.63]We've not seen what's through this door.
[321:56.92]It was painful, but it was fun.
[321:59.24]I enjoyed every second of it.
[322:00.86]Do not confuse my goofy annoyance with dislike of the game.
[322:05.63]I love it.
[322:06.35]I'm having a great time.
[322:08.49]Everything is amazing.
[322:10.08]And we're going to finally find out who the Dragon King is.
[322:24.50]There he is!
[322:29.13]Okay, there's the dragon master, or whatever his name is.
[322:34.09]I gotta get ready to slash him.
[322:44.24]Enter, Werner.
[322:46.36]Do not be afraid.
[322:52.03]Okay.
[322:52.15]My name is Adelpate.
[322:54.62]I served your father, though not well enough.
[322:59.99]Oh, I knew well enough that Diakonov would attempt murder, in spite of the Pact of Peace.
[323:07.33]But I failed to foresee his method.
[323:11.27]So, your father died and I am locked in my chamber.
[323:17.08]Diakonov's magic is greater than mine, you see.
[323:20.91]What you must know is this.
[323:23.63]Like all young von Wallenrod children, you were sent to live among simple folk as one of them.
[323:30.40]It is an additional lesson in humility.
[323:34.38]As tradition also required, you left the farm on your 18th birthday.
[323:41.17]But instead of being welcomed by your father,
[323:44.62]You have come to a castle of death.
[323:47.78]Diakonov does not expect you to present yourself for election, Werner.
[323:53.20]He has placed serious obstacles in your path.
[323:57.35]Even if you do succeed in calling out the knights, you must win a majority.
[324:02.90]You cannot even call an election if you are not wearing the dragon armor worn by all knights.
[324:10.27]Oh, fuck.
[324:11.23]I need the armor.
[324:13.64]You will need to climb to the next floor of this castle and find the way to open your father's tomb.
[324:20.99]What?
[324:22.37]What are you talking about?
[324:31.14]I don't want to do an errand for you.
[324:39.67]I'm the son of Van Halen Lord, whatever his name is.
[324:52.23]What?
[325:06.21]I have to go back downstairs.
[325:07.39]I gotta get more.
[325:08.43]Wait, let me... Okay, hold on.
[325:10.20]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[325:14.35]I have to... Okay.
[325:16.45]That stupid sword that I said I don't want another sword, and we voted on it, I got a key instead.
[325:26.91]I need... I need to open the other one, and that sword apparently is an important family heirloom.
[325:33.25]When I picked it up last time, it just said, a sword.
[325:36.26]...
[325:49.42]I need another eye.
[325:50.36]I might even need more than one eye.
[325:52.73]So it's another find the hidden object.
[325:56.35]Find another orb.
[326:14.59]I wonder, I think there's three more eyes to find.
[326:17.82]How have I not found them though?
[326:19.04]I've been everywhere.
[326:23.00]I guess they would blend in pretty, but they're little orange pieces.
[326:27.75]Shit, okay.
[326:30.91]Where did I even find the first one?
[326:32.31]That felt like ages ago.
[326:36.24]Is this a family heirloom, right?
[326:43.94]Maybe in the chest in the treasure room.
[326:52.01]This is so fun, though.
[326:53.19]I like how collectively everyone... Okay.
[327:02.20]I think I have to go very far back.
[327:08.63]What was that?
[327:10.85]Somebody's walking around in here.
[327:13.82]He hates this game?
[327:14.72]I love this game.
[327:16.81]This game is so much fun.
[327:17.71]I'm having a ton of fun.
[327:22.56]Alright, where should I TP?
[327:23.90]Give me the right floor.
[327:26.62]I think it's level, what, level negative one?
[327:29.51]...
[327:41.30]We're looking for orbs.
[327:43.34]Little eyeballs is what we're trying to find.
[327:50.87]I'm going to take my time.
[327:51.79]Let's go quickly.
[327:53.41]That just counteracted everything I just said.
[327:55.85]Okay.
[327:56.37]What about here?
[327:58.68]Right here.
[327:59.96]This room.
[328:03.28]Josh knows where one is.
[328:04.28]Where's the one you know?
[328:10.07]This is not a puzzle.
[328:11.71]This is like a hidden object game, and it's okay if he tells me where one is.
[328:18.68]We're playing this together.
[328:20.28]Okay.
[328:27.22]Don't do it, Josh.
[328:28.76]What is that?
[328:29.20]Oh, it's...
[328:41.08]Last vase you thought had acid in it.
[328:42.95]You tried to pick it up a few times.
[328:44.23]You really just need to smash it.
[328:47.13]I knew it.
[328:50.92]I knew it.
[328:54.95]Okay.
[328:56.55]That's... I'm in the right spot though.
[328:58.71]It's in this area.
[329:03.14]It's like the alchemy room.
[329:10.18]I can remember where that was.
[329:19.99]A lot of them would be in here, honestly.
[329:22.73]I found the first one and a skeleton in here.
[329:26.12]So, maybe I should just slowly go through these again.
[329:32.29]Hey!
[329:32.65]What?
[329:35.85]Pick it up, it's right there.
[329:38.59]What are you talking about?
[329:39.50]I can't pick it up?
[329:42.96]That's clearly right there, isn't it?
[329:44.44]Right here?
[329:58.76]Can I not hold a blanket up for long enough?
[330:06.69]Brop it up with something?
[330:16.61]That's definitely it.
[330:19.60]The staff?
[330:30.09]Hmm.
[330:32.24]I don't think I have anything to prop it up with.
[330:41.81]It's actually not even under the blanket, Josh is saying.
[330:44.07]What?
[330:45.70]That's crazy to me.
[330:53.92]Is it right there?
[330:54.73]Is it this little button?
[331:00.55]There's one in this room, but it's not under that blanket.
[331:06.24]No way.
[331:18.78]That looks weird.
[331:19.84]Hold on.
[331:20.84]Can I just hit it?
[331:23.42]What?
[331:23.86]Reveal illusions.
[331:26.21]Watch this.
[331:29.87]Check it out.
[331:36.20]It's blah blah Olympics flower.
[331:49.07]Did I not do it right?
[331:51.41]Oh, that's wrong.
[332:00.01]Oh, come on.
[332:14.78]Shit.
[332:16.04]Okay.
[332:16.50]Yeah, I got it from this one.
[332:17.68]I already got this one from this guy.
[332:25.84]Yeah, I got one from the skeleton, because I spun him over, but that's weird that the blanket one isn't anything.
[332:32.47]How is that possible?
[332:33.15]I mean, this seems impossible.
[332:36.82]That one, that little object on the left is not it.
[332:45.57]Okay.
[332:47.57]Well, there's definitely others here.
[332:55.26]Just be thorough when you're looking around.
[333:08.42]How come that doesn't open?
[333:15.29]I don't think there's one in here.
[333:24.30]Go back and inspect the skeletons.
[333:26.42]You know what, dude?
[333:28.02]You're out of here.
[333:33.17]Alright, there's one.
[333:39.10]I love how he's too weak to hold the other one up, but not that one.
[333:54.30]Okay, so I got a second one.
[333:58.51]What about in here?
[333:59.19]I feel like there might be one hanging around in here.
[334:01.23]I can smash the cabinet, right?
[334:12.29]I already tried here.
[334:13.07]No, it's not here.
[334:16.71]Okay, how about back here?
[334:20.28]Keep going.
[334:26.99]I'm going to go... Hold on, go through here for a second.
[334:31.92]Turn around.
[334:33.64]Where is that alchemy cabinet?
[334:36.44]Back here?
[334:36.82]It is back there somewhere.
[334:53.13]Let me check in here.
[334:53.79]I don't think I was that thorough in here.
[335:01.31]No.
[335:09.32]Not in that sack.
[335:10.89]Not on the table, really?
[335:12.19]I can't move him around or pick him up.
[335:19.94]We should have a stream where it's just you talking mumbled in another room.
[335:31.13]I mean, that'd be kind of weird, I guess.
[335:35.56]That's literally every stream.
[335:36.64]What, you put me on and just walk away?
[335:37.94]Where is that glass container?
[335:53.04]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[335:53.72]What about here?
[335:54.82]There's definitely one in here.
[335:56.00]There was nothing in this room.
[335:57.70]Zero.
[335:59.14]I didn't get anything from here.
[336:02.20]There has to be one in here.
[336:04.78]There's no way there's not.
[336:14.35]In one of the bowls or something?
[336:15.72]I don't know.
[336:16.16]It's gonna be on one of the leaves.
[336:26.21]That's stupid.
[336:40.96]in his hand there's no way it has to be right what is that what is that honestly what is this what is this a crowbar what am I gonna do why I got a crowbar now what can I open with the crowbar
[337:17.65]Crowbar to lift that heavy blanket.
[337:19.89]I feel like the crowbar would be on one of these indented wall pieces.
[337:31.12]Okay, I need to go into that alchemy room, which I don't know where it is.
[337:44.26]Where was that alchemy room?
[337:49.24]I feel like it's one of these rooms, but I don't remember.
[337:51.82]Maybe this one?
[337:59.61]Other side.
[338:02.66]Did this game come out before Half-Life?
[338:04.36]Um, 1993?
[338:05.08]94, 93?
[338:08.83]When did Half-Life come out?
[338:18.78]I want that alchemy room with the glass cabinet.
[338:23.11]There it is.
[338:23.89]No, it's not.
[338:25.05]Maybe this might be one here, though.
[338:36.73]Can I just break this?
[338:43.89]No.
[338:46.48]That little alchemy room is here somewhere.
[338:48.90]The guy goes to a bar and asks for a rum and a coke.
[338:58.67]What's wrong with that?
[339:06.78]What's wrong with that?
[339:12.85]No.
[339:13.33]Where is that rum?
[339:16.01]Where is that room with the glass case?
[339:18.37]It's like right here.
[339:20.05]I just, I just don't know which one of these doors it is.
[339:32.76]You're almost my mother's age.
[339:35.69]Well, that's fine.
[339:36.51]Well, what do you want from me?
[339:39.19]I think it's in the middle.
[339:51.06]Wait, maybe I actually can prop this up.
[339:56.93]No.
[340:09.49]There's one just like this that has another eye in it.
[340:14.04]Once I actually remember or figure out which one of these 300 doors has the stupid alchemy room.
[340:21.77]Where is this room?
[340:32.30]You know, I've stumbled upon it accidentally like three times.
[340:42.51]I've probably clicked on every single door that's not the alchemy door.
[340:48.46]And label your doors.
[340:51.18]Call it the kitchen.
[340:52.26]You have 200 doors in your mansion.
[340:56.99]Label them.
[341:05.66]Josh said there was still one more in here.
[341:07.24]Wait.
[341:21.62]Alright, if I'm just standing right here, does anybody know where the alchemy room is?
[341:26.63]Where's the alchemy room from here?
[341:27.75]Does anybody have any idea?
[341:32.68]Please help me.
[341:44.68]These be a terrible direction.
[341:46.58]Yeah, I do.
[341:47.26]When every door looks the same and when you teleport around and you turn at fucking 40 degree angles, every room is the same to me.
[341:57.64]I need that room with that case with the chain on it.
[342:09.45]It's upstairs off the throne room.
[342:11.56]Oh my god, I think you're right.
[342:16.87]Different fucking hallway with surrounded- You know, you are right.
[342:20.68]It's in the basement.
[342:21.94]Oh, come on!
[342:22.92]I'm gonna teleport in there.
[342:27.81]I don't give a shit.
[342:28.47]I'm going back there.
[342:29.61]It's in the basement, and it's one of the ones in the basement.
[342:41.12]What is teleport again?
[342:45.53]I was in the wrong room with eight doors on the hot wall.
[342:49.22]You know what I'm saying?
[342:50.05]I was in the wrong room.
[343:15.09]Get away from me.
[343:17.27]I've got... I've got places to be.
[343:21.24]Okay, it's in here somewhere.
[343:23.24]I think it's this one.
[343:27.67]Yes, it is.
[343:28.19]Oh my god, I was in the wrong hallway!
[343:30.39]Everybody relax.
[343:33.45]We're just gonna smash this fucking door.
[343:36.31]Excuse me?
[343:45.53]Um, excuse me?
[343:59.13]How do I open that, though?
[344:04.42]Oh, that thing right there.
[344:05.44]Get it.
[344:13.61]How do I get close enough to smash it?
[344:33.51]Fireball, maybe?
[344:36.38]Oh my... I never would have figured that out in a hundred years.
[344:39.86]I wouldn't even try that.
[344:42.19]I would have been so... No, I wouldn't even have thought to do that.
[344:46.41]Alright, we're so close to becoming the Dragon Lord.
[344:50.08]I need one more eye.
[344:51.10]I think.
[344:54.85]I need one more eye.
[345:07.11]Alright.
[345:08.93]Now that vault room is... Josh is saying go to the vault room now.
[345:13.57]Alright, let's go.
[345:14.50]Let's go!
[345:16.54]Let's go!
[345:19.60]Like, let's go!
[345:22.29]I don't even know how I got here.
[345:48.23]Okay, where's the vault room?
[345:51.06]I don't remember.
[345:52.68]I'm going to pull up the teleporter.
[346:05.77]That glass case armory vault.
[346:07.87]The one where I got all the items are?
[346:12.06]Oh, we got a raid here.
[346:14.58]We got a raid.
[346:15.56]Hold on.
[346:19.08]We just got Limes just came in.
[346:21.93]Limealicious, thank you Limes for the raid.
[346:25.34]Welcome everybody.
[346:29.33]Thank you, Limes.
[346:30.19]That's very nice of you.
[346:33.58]We're in the middle of.
[346:37.37]playing Dragon Lore, the game for the 3DO and PC.
[346:42.66]We're getting close to the end of the game.
[346:44.68]So I know a lot of you, this is like Infinity War.
[346:47.42]This game is super popular.
[346:48.88]It just came out 20 to 30 years ago, about 36 years ago.
[346:54.31]So if you don't want spoilers for the end of Dragon Lore, we're pretty much at the end of the game.
[346:58.17]So big spoilers incoming, big game, and we're getting there.
[347:03.26]So thanks a lot.
[347:05.04]If you want to stick around, let's go.
[347:07.73]We currently need your help, Lime's viewers, to find one more eyeball.
[347:14.92]But I actually am just going to ask my mod where it is.
[347:19.12]And he's going to tell me.
[347:22.91]Alright, I need to teleport.
[347:31.30]What level is this on?
[347:37.31]Level 2?
[347:38.17]Level 1?
[347:42.58]I'm so all over the place.
[347:43.52]I'm so confused.
[347:44.22]I think it's level 1.
[347:49.01]Anybody have any... I think I'm close.
[347:56.76]I just don't remember.
[347:57.48]It's been so long since I've been in that room.
[348:01.38]I don't remember where it is.
[348:04.50]help text dragon dude the teleport is cool but it only helps if you know I I'm just not I just there it's just I have such trouble with games like this where I don't have a map
[348:27.99]And the map I do have is just like a bunch of squares.
[348:30.15]It doesn't mean anything to me.
[348:31.11]It might as well be written in Chinese.
[348:33.26]I can't read it.
[348:33.88]I have no idea what it's trying to say.
[348:48.86]It was just so long ago that I don't remember where that was.
[348:55.36]You're really close to beating the game?
[348:56.82]Oh, I'm ready.
[348:57.46]I can't wait.
[348:58.14]It's going to be fun.
[349:01.89]You should learn Mandarin.
[349:04.39]I always thought it would be kind of cool to learn Japanese, Chinese, just to be able to understand anything.
[349:13.42]It's near the swimming pool.
[349:16.28]Alright, that's all I needed to know.
[349:20.65]I'm completely locked in now.
[350:06.15]It's that fucking swimming pool, man.
[350:08.51]I don't know where the swimming pool is.
[350:10.47]I'm so close, but so far.
[350:14.02]Where's the swimming pool?
[350:16.48]There's like five, there's like 12 layer cake of this castle.
[350:20.22]What layer is the swimming pool on?
[350:32.62]I gotta go down to the lower level.
[350:38.60]Go click, go down, go.
[350:40.87]Oh my, I've spammed.
[350:47.02]Go down the stairs, please.
[351:09.85]Dude, I'm so fucking lost.
[351:12.20]I just want to get to the fucking swimming pool.
[351:21.99]God!
[351:30.30]Get me to the swimming pool!
[351:38.15]This is the torture room!
[351:40.40]Oh, I made a wrong turn somewhere!
[351:46.99]Finally!
[351:47.57]Oh my god!
[351:49.49]Okay.
[351:53.25]Swimming pool, here we are.
[352:05.49]In the swimming pool.
[352:07.67]Down here.
[352:10.23]Oh no!
[352:12.98]This is where I drop and I go... Alright, so I'm looking for... What am I looking for again here?
[352:36.20]I'm looking for that treasure room or the glass treasure room.
[352:40.23]Wasn't it hidden somewhere?
[352:42.93]It wasn't right here.
[352:48.12]This is like three and a half hours ago.
[352:52.53]The glass armory vault room.
[353:03.25]Not this one.
[353:04.13]This is where I just went in.
[353:06.18]Yeah, that's the torture room.
[353:13.81]Okay, maybe one of these ones back here?
[353:15.21]I got it!
[353:28.87]Alright, let's go.
[353:40.58]Boom.
[353:41.80]Put one eye in.
[353:44.01]Save it here because I do this wrong.
[353:50.29]Yeah.
[353:50.41]Let's go.
[353:54.78]There it is.
[353:55.24]Your father's sword.
[353:56.38]The one you threw away.
[353:57.60]It is actually the sword you threw in the trash.
[354:04.85]It's just a sword, whatever.
[354:06.79]I mean, when you came down here four hours of gameplay ago, when you picked it up and it said a sword, you have five swords already.
[354:15.06]It doesn't say family specific heirloom sword.
[354:27.31]There it is, your family's shield.
[354:29.81]You need that to slay the dragon, the ultimate dragon.
[354:35.69]A shield.
[354:36.49]I still wouldn't even care.
[354:38.52]Let's put it on, right?
[354:42.52]It's not my size.
[354:43.36]It doesn't fit my head.
[354:44.29]It's the wrong hat size.
[354:46.49]Alright.
[354:47.03]Last one.
[354:49.45]It's in this room.
[354:50.82]I know that for a fact.
[354:51.88]Let's go.
[354:52.72]This is fun.
[355:01.57]Alright.
[355:09.33]I see it!
[355:11.13]Look!
[355:11.83]Chat!
[355:12.77]These... I'm being weird, I'm sorry.
[355:17.32]I ate the vibes, swallowed them, digested them, shit them out, and they're... that's where they are.
[355:33.26]And there's the legendary crossbow.
[355:37.25]Okay, I have all the family heirloom items.
[355:40.88]If I go up there with all this shit, that guy makes me go on an orb hunt again.
[355:45.47]I'll find the hidden four orbs.
[355:50.87]One could be in a planter, one could be on a shelf, one could be underneath a blanket.
[355:55.41]You don't want to find the other four metal orbs?
[355:59.48]One could be on a windowsill.
[356:00.48]One could be inside of a planter.
[356:01.72]One could be on a ceiling.
[356:02.66]One could be in a bird's nest.
[356:05.02]If I have to do another orb test, I'm done.
[356:10.47]We're not doing another orb hunt.
[356:11.81]We're not doing an Easter egg hunt, okay?
[356:13.51]April was fucking six months ago.
[356:18.64]Whatever, four.
[356:24.77]Okay.
[356:26.43]It's time.
[356:29.98]Time to get back up there.
[356:32.92]Do you have anything else to say?
[356:35.72]What?
[356:40.23]I'm so glad I talked to him again.
[356:44.23]No, you can't give back.
[356:46.31]This is a re-gift.
[356:47.65]You must have been really annoying.
[356:50.88]Oh, boy.
[356:51.52]I don't really want him.
[356:55.01]What did you do?
[356:55.97]Has he been pissing and shitting in places he wasn't supposed to?
[356:59.36]Has he been asking you a bunch of questions you don't want to answer?
[357:01.82]Like, why is the sky blue?
[357:05.99]I don't know.
[357:07.19]It just is.
[357:07.59]Oh, man.
[357:10.49]I got... Okay.
[357:15.03]Oh, boy.
[357:16.64]We got a re-gift.
[357:17.44]He must have been really annoying.
[357:19.34]Okay.
[357:20.66]It's time.
[357:22.14]Now I gotta get back up to the
[357:25.09]How do I get back up to where he was?
[357:29.55]It's through that big door.
[357:31.11]I gotta go up.
[357:34.30]Okay, I gotta go up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[357:37.52]It's up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[357:46.42]It's as up as I can go.
[357:48.30]Gotta figure out how to get out of the pool first.
[357:55.17]Get me out of the pool.
[357:58.48]Get me out of the pool!
[357:59.94]I just clicked to the same spot last time and I got out!
[358:02.52]God... Come on, man.
[358:07.79]What are the Limes viewers gonna think about me?
[358:09.61]Come on, I gotta get out of the... I can't... I can't... It's stuck in the pool again.
[358:17.94]Oh, I have to teleport out of the pool.
[358:19.14]This is... This is a bad look.
[358:22.05]What will the Limes viewers think about me now?
[358:38.71]go alright now we gotta go up I'm ready I'm ready to slay the ultimate dragon with the ultimate well blood whatever it is where's the staircase I'm actually really glad that I beat this I didn't think I was gonna come back to it I thought maybe I would but I'm uh I'm I'm happy I didn't I'm so curious about the ending
[359:10.52]You're 30 minutes into a 4 hour walkthrough.
[359:12.40]Guys, I need to tell you.
[359:15.65]It's very important to understand.
[359:17.87]If somebody uploads a walkthrough to YouTube, that's like an hour and 45 minutes.
[359:21.82]It's because they already know where everything is.
[359:24.38]They already know what pixel to click on.
[359:25.90]They already know where everything is.
[359:27.52]The whole point of a walkthrough is for people like me, by proxy, to have somebody else tell me where to go.
[359:36.47]You think it took them 10 seconds to find the four metal orbs?
[359:41.14]They probably ran around.
[359:41.98]They probably were saying the same swear words I've been saying.
[359:45.59]What's with these fucking metal orbs?
[359:46.73]I don't know where the orbs are.
[359:48.03]What do you mean an orb?
[359:49.79]And they know where the orbs are.
[359:51.20]And they record themselves picking up the orbs.
[359:52.66]So then I know where to get the orbs.
[360:00.15]Okay.
[360:00.61]I need to go up.
[360:07.00]Where is the staircase to go up from here?
[360:13.15]It's in the room with the pots.
[360:26.61]Where is it actually?
[360:31.96]Oh my god, again.
[360:32.98]You walked out one door and there's a door behind you.
[360:36.32]Which door did I come out of?
[360:37.95]Okay, I gotta stop raging at chat members and I need to just figure out where to go.
[360:55.51]This is the... This one?
[360:56.87]This one, yep.
[360:57.53]It's this one.
[361:01.64]Alright everybody, get ready.
[361:23.73]And that's the fucking dickhead's front door again.
[361:27.32]I'm gonna knock on the door and we're gonna say, hey, buddy, here's every orb, here's every eyeball, and here's all my father's shit.
[361:48.29]Hmm.
[361:48.39]Good work.
[361:49.51]That is the shield of your father's defense.
[361:54.21]Good work.
[361:55.39]That is the sword of your father's courage.
[362:06.17]Good work.
[362:07.19]That is the crowbar of your father's decency.
[362:17.02]No, no, no.
[362:17.80]Get rid of that.
[362:18.44]I don't want that.
[362:19.85]That had nothing to do with your father.
[362:21.63]I don't like that.
[362:22.39]I don't like what that is.
[362:24.25]Remove that from the pentagram or whatever the fuck this thing is.
[362:28.17]I don't want to see that ever again for the rest of my life.
[362:34.68]All the items are there.
[362:37.46]What do you have to say now?
[362:40.64]... ... ...
[362:46.33]That should do it.
[362:47.94]We have talked enough for the moment.
[362:50.32]It is time to act.
[362:52.70]Climb the stairs and beware.
[362:57.29]Did I pick him back up?
[363:01.69]I think that guy just wanted a bunch of free stuff.
[363:05.74]I don't see any magical glowing objects.
[363:07.98]This isn't shiny.
[363:10.44]This doesn't have power on it.
[363:12.12]I think he just made a bunch of stuff for to get a bunch of cool items.
[363:19.34]Alright, I'm ready.
[363:24.83]Here we go.
[363:26.45]What do you have in your room anyways?
[363:27.63]What's this stuff?
[363:41.07]I love this.
[363:41.55]I love all the potions.
[363:45.52]Can I look through the telescope?
[363:51.13]Why do you have a little guy in there?
[363:53.04]Stop blocking me.
[363:53.82]I'm trying to see who's in there.
[364:04.13]Alright, we'll get out of the way.
[364:16.82]Does that guy vote?
[364:21.21]Whoa, weird.
[364:34.13]Wait, what is that?
[364:34.91]Hold on.
[364:41.20]Just checking.
[364:54.91]weird place ladder alright I made it to the top of the castle do you remember when I played this for the first time they were like you need to get to the top of the castle I got it and there's something in the wall a big red button
[365:21.58]This is where the sprinklers all turn on.
[365:24.05]And I get soaking wet and they all laugh at me.
[365:27.59]See, he actually went out there and did all that.
[365:29.78]Just to be out there at exactly 7 o'clock to get hit by the sprinklers.
[365:33.00]What a dork.
[365:34.97]You're going to do the Adam Sandler thing to me?
[365:37.91]Why can I not click anything?
[365:42.72]It's just sitting on a ledge?
[365:43.76]You put something that expensive on the ledge?
[365:45.42]What are you, crazy?
[365:49.23]You put that in the corner down here.
[365:51.15]It's hovering over the ledge.
[365:55.85]Can you say the Gideon-Ofnir line, please?
[365:57.67]It makes me happy.
[365:58.39]Yeah, that's fine.
[366:08.22]That's the Gideon-Ofnir.
[366:10.62]They're all going.
[366:16.67]It was your birthday.
[366:17.99]I had to do it.
[366:26.35]Uh, that is the gem that I now need to put into the coffin.
[366:30.46]Do I believe?
[366:31.28]Open up the ca- I- Now I get- That's where I- That's it, right?
[366:34.46]Let's go do that now?
[366:38.53]That cave with the coffin in it in the very beginning of the game.
[366:50.63]What do you have to say?
[366:53.13]It really is so annoying that they give you the lord vessel this late in the game.
[367:10.66]Seriously.
[367:21.30]Can I have my father's stuff?
[367:24.50]I mean, isn't that the sacred shield and stuff?
[367:29.01]Why is it on the ground?
[367:30.66]Should I get it?
[367:35.41]Okay, here's the magical map.
[367:50.51]I think I just have to teleport.
[368:01.69]I already had this though.
[368:03.72]Was I not supposed to see this?
[368:25.25]Here we go.
[368:29.86]Alright, this is it.
[368:30.86]This is a big deal.
[368:38.24]Anything new to say?
[368:38.96]Yes.
[368:58.21]I got it.
[368:59.61]I'll take care of it.
[369:25.45]Why did I figure it was going to be a breastplate, not... Like, Samus is an armor.
[369:37.06]Well, let's... That doesn't look good.
[369:43.25]That has seen about 10 million years of decay or whatever.
[369:47.31]It's been awhile.
[369:48.97]I don't know if this is blocking very many attacks.
[369:50.76]This thing is decrepit.
[369:52.38]It's dusty.
[369:53.90]This may have been great 10,000 years ago.
[370:03.17]Shield is pretty cool though.
[370:04.47]I'll take the shield.
[370:08.87]Any cool sword?
[370:15.88]Alright.
[370:18.43]So now I'm good.
[370:19.51]I'm decked out.
[370:20.21]I'm good to go.
[370:20.79]I... I think he's dead at this point.
[370:35.37]I'm just carrying around a dead body.
[370:40.58]Now do I just go to the council?
[370:44.45]That was my quest the whole time, was to get that.
[370:52.04]I think I'm just... I just go now.
[370:54.07]Am I ready?
[370:54.61]I think they're gonna vote.
[371:08.86]I have to go talk to the wizard at the top of the tower again.
[371:17.28]Let's do that.
[371:33.39]What's up?
[371:34.27]Excellent, excellent.
[371:36.41]Remember to don the armor before you present yourself for election.
[371:40.94]Are you voting for this?
[371:41.86]Now, Werner, something very important.
[371:45.51]To be elected by the Brotherhood of Dragon Knights, you must arrive riding on your dragon's back.
[371:53.76]As you may know, your dragon is imprisoned in his lair beneath the pool.
[372:00.46]Don't.
[372:01.50]You fucking dick.
[372:04.10]I'm not going to get you four orbs.
[372:07.75]What I need to set your dragon free is some of Diakonov's blood.
[372:15.09]We're good.
[372:15.81]I thought he was going to make me go get carrots and ingredients and frog's legs and bat wings and... I was about to bit my pants.
[372:26.83]No.
[372:27.69]Don't give it to me.
[372:29.60]I will tell you how and when to use it.
[372:33.55]Now, we shall capture the enemy in my pentacle.
[372:38.82]Your task will be to keep him there.
[372:43.59]In my chalice, you will see an amulet.
[372:47.47]Take a look.
[372:48.07]When I say, going so soon...
[372:52.25]Okay, okay.
[372:55.13]I'm not going to do this on the first try.
[373:00.56]You better not miss your cue.
[373:08.21]Where's the amulet?
[373:11.72]I didn't even get a chance to go to the bathroom.
[373:15.66]I had to go to the bathroom.
[373:23.35]Where's the amulet he's talking about?
[373:24.73]On the table?
[373:31.64]You should have kept the blood to kill me with, farm boy.
[373:36.17]And you, old Adelpate, still learning your art.
[373:42.12]A wasted effort.
[373:44.06]I can escape at any time.
[373:46.72]That's the wrong line!
[373:49.56]That's the wrong line!
[373:50.74]You fucked up the line!
[373:51.79]It's going so soon!
[373:52.91]How would I have known?
[373:53.65]Where is it?
[373:55.29]Where is it?
[373:55.85]Where is it?
[373:58.05]Where is it?
[374:00.21]It's in the chalice?
[374:15.78]I can't even go into my inventory!
[374:22.75]Fuck you!
[374:23.27]Eat this!
[374:24.01]I d-
[374:48.06]I'm going to reach in and pull out like a rabbit out of a hat?
[375:05.20]What?
[375:07.90]I killed your friend, by the way.
[375:16.25]What?
[375:17.27]I made the right call.
[375:19.04]I would honor the pact.
[375:22.32]You're dying.
[375:24.20]If you're going to release me, it better be soon.
[375:29.11]Yes, I am growing weak.
[375:33.36]You have an effigy of the Von Valenrod dragon.
[375:36.70]Drop it.
[375:37.46]So that's the reason you brought me here.
[375:41.35]Very well.
[375:42.11]There.
[375:44.26]It won't get the boy elected.
[375:47.10]He doesn't have enough votes.
[375:53.10]That's the difference between us.
[375:59.63]Is the guy going to win the election or something?
[376:02.53]Yes, that is the difference between us.
[376:11.24]Break the effigy, Werner.
[376:14.32]And take this.
[376:17.62]You will have your revenge.
[376:28.40]Is he getting away?
[376:29.10]Dude, what the fuck happened?
[376:40.05]Break it.
[376:44.84]I was trying to throw him.
[376:49.02]I was trying to throw him and it didn't work.
[376:52.72]Um, where is this thing?
[376:56.37]Why do I have burnt meat in my inventory?
[376:59.09]Oh, that's okay.
[376:59.77]Wait, wait, wait.
[377:00.37]That's my armor.
[377:07.30]Where is this dragon effigy?
[377:13.47]Is it on the ground?
[377:22.51]Oh, that's my father's sword!
[377:24.51]I have so much shit in my inventory!
[377:36.07]I'm carrying around a little dead guy, okay?
[377:39.41]Why?
[377:39.93]I can't pick any other items up.
[377:42.60]I need to get rid of this stuff.
[377:48.92]Why am I holding this?
[377:53.09]I don't need the sulfur anymore.
[377:54.41]I don't need the bag of marbles.
[377:55.95]I don't need the canteen that I never drank out of.
[378:00.43]I'm freaking out right now.
[378:04.64]Close!
[378:05.08]No!
[378:05.92]Open it!
[378:06.30]I have like a decorative coffee mug!
[378:11.73]Get- Throw it away!
[378:13.48]I can't put anything down.
[378:18.81]I keep looking at this guy.
[378:22.27]Alright, finally I'm holding the sword.
[378:23.74]I have to walk around with this guy in my hands.
[378:32.36]Okay, he's dead.
[378:34.07]He's definitely dead, by the way.
[378:36.25]There's no way he's alive.
[378:39.17]I guess it'd be food or water in probably a few days at least.
[378:44.25]And I don't know what happened with him and the dragon.
[378:46.46]He may have re-gifted to me dead.
[378:49.72]He may have given him to me dead.
[378:50.72]I don't know.
[378:53.42]This is the thing I need to carry.
[378:55.13]So we're going to pick up this... We're going to put the old chicken on the ground.
[378:59.57]I'm going to pick up my father's crossbow.
[379:05.83]I gotta break this.
[379:18.48]How do I break it?
[379:21.61]Do I have to smash it with something?
[379:22.77]How the fuck do I break- Like, I'm just carrying it.
[379:24.31]I don't care.
[379:25.80]Alright, where am I going with this?
[379:26.92]To the council?
[379:31.84]Am I going to the council?
[379:36.37]Somebody just please tell me that there's nothing else on the ground I need to take.
[379:39.31]That's all I want to know.
[379:44.02]I need my dragon.
[379:52.80]Okay.
[379:53.56]I need to leave this room so I can throw some shit on the ground.
[379:59.71]Alright, give me a minute here.
[380:00.87]This is the end game.
[380:02.91]I'm getting rid of all this crap in my fucking inventory.
[380:10.69]Get rid of the old shield that I don't need.
[380:12.32]I don't like this.
[380:17.81]I don't need the staff anymore.
[380:19.51]I'm keeping the healing potion.
[380:21.80]What's in the bag?
[380:30.31]What is this?
[380:30.67]An old page from an old book?
[380:32.34]I don't care.
[380:39.79]Yeah, I don't need this map anymore.
[380:42.49]Goodbye.
[380:43.43]Get rid of it.
[380:43.84]I don't care.
[380:44.96]Throw it away.
[380:49.51]Good.
[380:51.19]I have enough room now.
[380:53.83]Okay.
[380:55.18]Is there nothing else I need here?
[380:56.26]Now I just gotta go to the... What's next?
[381:07.28]I don't need the goblin.
[381:08.16]He's gonna rest and have plenty of... He's gonna... He's gonna rest for a while.
[381:18.69]Don't pick that up again.
[381:19.51]I don't want it.
[381:21.59]Alright, I'm teleporting somewhere.
[381:23.19]I need to get my dragon.
[381:24.21]My dragon is in the pool.
[381:28.42]I'm sorry.
[381:28.70]That was such a shitshow.
[381:29.92]I... What's next?
[381:32.02]I gotta get the crossbow.
[381:35.25]Okay, let me go pick up the items that are on the ground.
[381:39.74]That was a shit show.
[381:53.64]I didn't even want to go up here.
[382:06.60]Give me the fuck out of here.
[382:10.51]Okay.
[382:11.25]Give me the shield.
[382:12.89]This is important.
[382:13.69]I guess I should probably have it on, shouldn't I?
[382:18.32]There's the crossbow.
[382:21.56]So I have the shield, the crossbow, and the sword.
[382:23.22]And... Alright, fine.
[382:33.91]I'll take it.
[382:34.33]I'll take him.
[382:34.85]I'll take him with me.
[382:36.03]We'll get him to the end.
[382:38.06]We'll get him to the end of the game.
[382:43.48]That's GG.
[382:44.18]Alright.
[382:45.30]Now.
[382:47.23]Finally.
[382:50.87]He was explaining to me how to get the dragon.
[382:53.03]I need to smash that orb to get the dragon, right?
[383:02.75]Throw him at the boss.
[383:04.11]I don't think that's gonna work.
[383:17.75]Run with the boss.
[383:18.57]Alright.
[383:19.16]So I have to... Your dragon is under the pool.
[383:21.72]I need the dragon before I can get the votes.
[383:25.06]We're right at the end of the game.
[383:30.89]And I don't know how... I was laughing at too much stupid shit.
[383:35.72]I have to break this right now or somewhere else.
[383:45.72]I left a dragon statue up there.
[383:47.28]Do I need it though?
[383:49.50]I gotta pee one more time.
[383:50.54]I gotta pee bad.
[384:03.76]So this will be the last break of the stream.
[384:06.52]We're going to get to the end of the game and it's going to be glorious.
[384:11.36]While I'm gone, talk amongst yourselves on what I need to do next.
[384:17.07]You only fought that guy to get the effigy.
[384:22.72]I was just sitting on the ground.
[384:23.52]Well, I took the effigy.
[384:24.42]I took the little goblin guy.
[384:37.50]There it is.
[384:37.90]Alright.
[384:43.72]Um... Son of a... God damn it.
[384:46.87]I'm just gonna put him in the sack.
[385:03.16]This is too much shit in this game.
[385:10.11]I got everything.
[385:15.20]I got everything.
[385:15.96]So now when I come back, I'm going to pee.
[385:18.09]I'll be right back.
[385:19.15]And we'll finish the game up.
[385:20.47]See you in 30 seconds.
[385:23.41]Saving it here.
[385:31.46]I'll leave you with the twinkly sounds.
[385:39.69]Here we go.
[386:11.77]Thank you.
[386:47.70].
[387:14.13].
[387:14.17].
[387:24.65].
[387:48.94].
[387:59.03]so so
[388:36.52]Thank you.
[389:10.63]I have returned.
[389:21.58]You guys ready to see the end of this?
[389:31.39]It's been quite a journey.
[389:33.57]I've thoroughly enjoyed myself.
[389:37.14]I had a lot of fun.
[389:38.88]The reason why I play old games like this a lot of times is because I remember how some of these were.
[389:44.30]How weird and goofy and outrageous some of these games used to be.
[389:49.51]But it's kind of fun just to see it through.
[389:56.74]Having a great time.
[389:57.72]Hope you're having fun.
[390:00.05]That's the point, right?
[390:01.73]Alright, let's do it.
[390:03.21]I'm ready to end this.
[390:09.93]Make sure I have the right headphone in.
[390:21.06]Okay.
[390:23.26]Let me just have some water.
[390:24.26]Funny, I thought this stream was only going to be four hours max today.
[390:38.39]But here we are.
[390:40.91]Alright, so it's inventory.
[390:46.78]You destroy the effigy.
[390:49.72]That's what we had to do.
[390:51.40]Boom.
[390:55.19]See you later.
[391:04.34]Now, we go talk to that guy because he just freaked out.
[391:14.24]Teleport.
[391:20.91]I need my book.
[391:32.78]Teleport to the dragon lair.
[391:50.05]Are you my dragon?
[391:54.55]He is my dragon.
[391:55.35]Are we gonna fly in?
[392:10.03]Now go.
[392:12.43]Receive the necessary votes.
[392:15.29]End the corruption and become the new Dragon Knight.
[392:23.24]What an entrance.
[392:26.87]How many votes do I get?
[392:27.89]How many people exist and how many votes do I need?
[392:31.66]I killed that guy!
[392:32.70]That guy's not alive?
[392:34.85]I killed that guy!
[392:35.99]Why is he...
[392:42.34]That guy is not even alive.
[392:44.06]Half these people, I've killed them.
[392:50.37]Isn't that guy trapped in a prison?
[392:52.74]Okay, that's fine.
[392:58.01]That's one.
[393:09.26]Wait, the ring has a vote?
[393:16.20]Two to one.
[393:21.63]Three to one, let's go.
[393:30.68]Yeah, that wasn't your vase, dickhead.
[393:35.74]Boom, four to two.
[393:40.88]How do you vote?
[393:42.32]Against.
[393:43.04]Nah, I didn't like you anyways.
[393:44.69]How do you vote?
[393:46.11]Against.
[393:46.89]Oh yeah, I'm not good at wisdom, huh?
[393:48.92]How do you vote?
[393:50.36]Four.
[393:51.00]That's five to four.
[393:52.50]How do you vote?
[393:53.78]Four.
[393:54.77]Yes!
[393:55.39]That's six to four.
[393:57.41]How do you vote?
[393:59.70]Against.
[394:00.32]Six to five.
[394:01.02]Get out of here.
[394:01.58]I win.
[394:01.86]The result of the voting... I did it!
[394:06.68]I'm so glad I killed that dwarf.
[394:09.09]I killed the two guys that I killed didn't vote and they would have voted against me.
[394:13.39]It would have been 7-6 if I left them alive.
[394:19.56]That's so funny.
[394:21.12]Let's go.
[394:26.42]I actually did it.
[394:28.53]You just voted against me.
[394:36.08]What a flip-flop.
[394:46.25]Get out of here.
[394:56.70]Talk about sucking up to the new boss.
[394:58.94]That's bullshit.
[395:05.98]That's so funny.
[395:08.59]If I left those other two alive, I would have got the bad ending.
[395:22.57]Look at all these places.
[395:38.06]That was a charming, fun game.
[395:39.34]I loved it.
[395:41.91]Okay, there's... It started at 10.
[395:44.33]It dropped down to like an 8.5.
[395:46.03]And then it came up to like a 9.
[395:48.94]Dropped down to like an 8.1 during the multiple orb routine.
[395:54.69]And then at the end, dropped back up to an 8 point... It dropped up to an 8.6.
[396:08.65]The real player was Josh the whole time.
[396:18.43]Hold on, what'd you say?
[396:19.43]Let me see what you said.
[396:20.55]You said something funny.
[396:27.20]Yeah, Josh played effectively an FMV version of the game.
[396:33.08]He played it in video parts.
[396:36.18]And it says, make sure you stay tuned for part two.
[396:40.04]It closed the game automatically.
[396:47.19]How does that compare to Dracula 3?
[396:48.95]Dracula 3 is unironically one of the worst games I think I've ever played on stream.
[396:55.10]It was awful.
[396:55.98]It was truly terrible.
[396:59.09]There was one or two redeeming qualities of that.
[397:02.32]There was the funny take your own blood part, which I think was worth the price of admission.
[397:07.85]That scene alone was worth it, I think.
[397:16.75]But yeah, that game as a whole was just taking phone calls.
[397:20.34]It was just terrible.
[397:28.86]But yeah, that was it.
[397:31.66]Sort of an impromptu stream today.
[397:32.97]I knew I... So that's the thing.
[397:35.33]This was almost a seven-hour stream.
[397:39.65]I just wanted to get it done.
[397:41.23]Because I was thinking about Dragon Lore.
[397:43.74]I got up this morning and I thought about something funny that happened on the first stream.
[397:46.48]And I said, hey, you know what?
[397:48.72]I know I want to give it the time to finish it.
[397:50.46]So why... I don't want to wait like a week to finish it.
[397:54.59]Because you know how that works.
[397:55.85]Two weeks go by and I don't ever play it again.
[397:57.35]So I just wanted to finish it.
[398:00.52]Yeah, big shout outs.
[398:01.30]Thanks mods for the hint bubbles.
[398:04.17]I appreciate it.
[398:06.23]Thanks, obviously, to everybody here for watching.
[398:09.22]Thanks to, you know, Ben Franklin, the inventor of electricity, to start the process of having us be able to stream and be in the same digital room together.
[398:23.69]Big thank you to the person that invented glass and metal soldering and stuff.
[398:33.10]That also contributes a lot to it.
[398:40.90]VintageGamer7 was the true hero for the walkthrough, yeah.
[398:46.58]Some of these games are so specific, but they're so fun, though.
[398:48.79]That's why I like to do them.
[398:49.69]Yeah, am I going to get the
[398:53.39]I could have like written it now.
[398:54.99]It's all good.
[398:55.67]We're just trying to have fun here.
[398:56.61]It's all good.
[398:58.63]I had a great time.
[399:01.56]What about the inventor of the little boo boo?
[399:04.28]No, that but I have nothing against the inventor of the boo boo.
[399:07.58]They just don't have anything to do with how I just streamed the game to you.
[399:18.23]But now you will not see me till after my birthday.
[399:25.05]And what we will do, that is a good question.
[399:27.41]I know Thursday we're probably going to potentially do some Horseman stuff.
[399:31.25]There's a bunch of stuff that... I want to do Mario Party.
[399:35.88]We're going to find a way to get... We'll get Ster a Switch.
[399:38.39]Find a way.
[399:43.33]But yeah.
[399:44.25]I'll see you at the least on Thursday.
[399:45.78]There might be another impromptu stream this week.
[399:48.86]But plan for Thursday.
[399:52.86]And I'll see you later.
[399:53.82]Take care.
[399:54.78]Have a great evening.
[399:55.86]Thanks for watching.
[399:56.78]Call your mother if you haven't.
[399:59.13]Call your father too, why not?
[400:01.19]See you later.
[400:01.73]Take care.
[400:02.49]Have fun.
[400:03.79]Make it a good day.
[400:04.89]Make it a good one, chat.
[400:09.96]And thanks again, Limes, for the raid.
[400:12.93]That was nice of you.
[400:14.15]Take care.
[400:16.63]I don't know if any of the Limes fans were here, but
[400:21.58]Thanks a lot.
[400:22.53]Take care.
[400:22.88]See you later.
