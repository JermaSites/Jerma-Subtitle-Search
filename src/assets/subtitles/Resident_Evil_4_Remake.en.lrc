[ve:60.16.100]

[00:23.49]Good evening.
[00:26.62]Or good morning for some of you.
[00:31.86]I was going to stream tomorrow.
[00:34.46]The Resident Evil 4 remake.
[00:37.44]But.
[00:38.98]Very big but.
[00:41.52]I thought the game was coming out tomorrow afternoon.
[00:46.16]I was ready and prepared for the game to launch tomorrow at like 1pm Pacific.
[00:52.79]But.
[00:55.68]Who's out right now?
[00:58.18]Came out like 30, 40 minutes ago.
[00:59.54]9 p.m.?
[01:01.62]That's pretty reasonable.
[01:03.18]And I'm very excited.
[01:05.94]So let's... Let's go quietly, because it's a little late.
[01:09.38]Let's go.
[01:09.72]Probably gonna be playing this well into the night here.
[01:17.20]You're supposed to be asleep?
[01:19.28]Well... I hope you have a good rest.
[01:23.61]It came out five hours ago in Canada.
[01:29.91]Well, I don't live in Canada.
[01:35.67]I live in, uh... We have a last week.
[01:40.87]Took a little bit to download.
[01:41.53]There was no preload.
[01:43.70]Which is a little surprising.
[01:46.88]Usually, day before, two days before a game, usually they'll have a preload, but it's fine.
[01:52.36]Had to start downloading it at exactly 9 p.m.
[01:57.80]But I'm very excited for this.
[02:00.60]And I'm going to tell you how excited I am, because this is a different scenario.
[02:05.86]Resident Evil 2 remake, one of my favorite games, for sure.
[02:11.60]Resident Evil 3 remake, not so much.
[02:14.22]It was alright.
[02:16.06]But I've heard really great things about this one.
[02:21.51]Resident Evil 4 on its own, the original one, is probably one of the best games ever made.
[02:26.97]It's definitely, I would say, deserves to be in the top 10, top 25.
[02:33.59]So let's do it.
[02:34.19]I haven't looked at very much info of this.
[02:37.89]I know there was a demo.
[02:38.81]I didn't play it.
[02:39.99]There's been videos and comparison footage.
[02:42.29]I haven't seen it.
[02:43.67]I've seen maybe one minute of footage of this game.
[02:47.86]There's an FOV slider.
[02:50.47]So, don't worry.
[02:52.55]I'm not going to freak out.
[02:55.13]There is an FOV slider in the game.
[02:57.59]So, we can relax on that.
[03:01.72]I have adjusted it accordingly.
[03:08.12]And I don't want to waste any time because other streamers are going faster than me.
[03:11.15]So, I have to hurry up.
[03:14.05]I got them.
[03:17.73]the deluxe version.
[03:18.73]I don't know.
[03:19.07]It said there was like extra stuff and I was like, should I get it?
[03:21.07]I don't know.
[03:22.11]I got it.
[03:22.47]Now, the way this is going to get really weird and I'm kind of concerned is I don't know what difficulty to pick because I don't think you can change it.
[03:41.74]But anyways, yes, I can confirm the lights are off.
[03:49.54]Lights are off.
[03:51.54]Scary.
[03:52.28]This is a scary game.
[03:56.32]Lights are off.
[03:58.38]I'm not playing on the super difficulty.
[04:00.61]No way.
[04:07.15]Alright, so let's go.
[04:08.83]Main story.
[04:09.37]I'm playing keyboard.
[04:10.93]Although maybe it's not a good idea.
[04:12.65]You can now change character costumes and accessories.
[04:15.22]Should I go do that?
[04:18.56]You can now change the original music slash sound effects.
[04:21.54]You guys can't even hear it.
[04:26.62]Okay.
[04:27.36]Extras.
[04:29.24]Leon's costume.
[04:37.65]Okay.
[04:38.89]Which one of these am I gonna... I feel like this is gonna fuck the whole game up.
[04:45.33]know what I mean I don't know if I want to do that I feel like it's going to change everything won't it change everything I'm just going to go normal for now alright we're going to go normal accessories how about sunglasses that's like a remake thing to put on right okay
[05:11.61]I'm going to stay with the defaults.
[05:14.56]What is that?
[05:18.62]What is the hero filter?
[05:20.16]It's just they took the gamma slider and dragged it all the way over.
[05:25.90]Original music?
[05:29.90]I don't know.
[05:30.56]How should I experience this?
[05:33.93]Default Andy.
[05:34.83]I can change this later.
[05:35.71]I'll be alright.
[05:36.69]I can change it later.
[05:39.67]Why are you so nervous?
[05:42.83]been looking forward to this game for a long time I'm like I love Resident Evil 4 and 5 I'm like let's go I'm so excited alright let's just go we're gonna go with the remake I want to be able to give you a real review so none of this we're gonna keep all this off I'm not nervous what are you talking about alright you guys ready Resident Evil 4 remake
[06:14.24]okay uh this is the problem I'm not gonna do this one standard for players who have not played Resident Evil 4 in 2005 okay you could this changes to easy if you die at game over whatever uh for players who have played Resident Evil 4 in 2000 I have played Resident Evil 4 does that mean I have to pick this difficulty stronger enemies and harder challenges higher prices for certain items
[06:40.69]how this is the problem with Resident Evil games though how much harder is this than standard because I can't change this and I don't want to get somewhere and be like what a disaster how much harder is it than standard it's about two and a half times harder moderately
[07:08.41]don't do it how would we know it's too hard find out alright how about this if the game is too I can't like restart it I'm just gonna do standard right like what I don't care I don't I think once you cross I think once you cross 35 years old I can I can pick this you know what I mean I can pick that
[07:32.32]When you go, when you're over 35, you can pick standard.
[07:34.20]That's fine.
[07:34.80]And like, oh, come on.
[07:35.90]Like I, that's fine.
[07:37.22]You're over 35.
[07:37.48]Yeah, we're good.
[07:41.16]I'm almost 40.
[07:42.30]I can pick that one.
[07:51.84]The expanded treasure map has been applied.
[07:54.48]Okay.
[07:54.60]What does that even mean?
[07:56.32]You can see the locations of hidden treasures.
[08:05.18]Alright, everybody quiet.
[08:08.14]Blood.
[08:38.19]September 30th, 1998.
[08:39.37]It's a day I'll never forget.
[08:42.77]The cop inside me died that day.
[08:47.67]That night, Raccoon City was wiped out thanks to the bioweapons created by Umbrella.
[08:53.71]Somehow I made it out, but too many others weren't so lucky.
[08:58.65]This is Resident Evil 2, by the way.
[09:00.48]I was asked later to join a top-secret government program.
[09:05.80]Not that I had a choice.
[09:08.93]Okay.
[09:36.77]I've been waiting for this game for at least two or three days.
[09:44.68]So tell me, Yankee, why did you come to this horrible place as close to nowhere that I've ever seen?
[09:52.56]Let's just say that someone must be very important.
[09:59.16]The chief gave the orders himself.
[10:01.28]Help him.
[10:01.80]Not very sunny right now.
[10:03.54]I'm sure you boys didn't come all the way out here to roast marshmallows.
[10:09.20]Maybe you did.
[10:12.86]You have a strange sense of humor.
[10:15.60]I'm going to let you in on a little secret.
[10:18.01]Just between us.
[10:18.97]Seems quiet.
[10:20.65]A lot of people have gone missing around here.
[10:22.09]Seems like it's kind of loud.
[10:23.95]And it's been that way for a while now.
[10:27.95]Well then.
[10:29.35]Should be just another day in the office, right?
[10:31.18]It's going to get loud just to give you a warning.
[10:33.36]I mean, last week there was a search for some missing hikers.
[10:37.32]I'm sure you'll do your best to help me.
[10:44.74]Looks like Duke Nukem Netflix adaptation.
[10:49.60]Is it because of the glasses?
[10:50.36]It's because of the glasses.
[10:53.79]That's what he's saying.
[10:54.95]I think this is it.
[11:01.57]Nature calls, huh?
[11:03.53]I'll be right back.
[11:10.61]Careful, yo.
[11:12.22]¿Te has bebido el bar entero?
[11:21.04]You smoke?
[11:32.10]Vaya sitio más tétrico.
[11:37.55]That was a pretty good first look.
[11:39.40]So that's it.
[11:39.94]I'll see you guys probably tomorrow.
[11:41.52]We'll pick it up right where we left off, I think.
[11:42.74]I just want to get a good feel for just the very beginning and see how it was.
[11:49.58]The opening cutscene to me is very important.
[11:50.80]I need to kind of digest it for a day or two, I'd say.
[11:52.99]Maybe three or four days.
[11:53.71]I need to kind of relax on the couch for a little while and kind of process everything.
[11:58.21]It's going to be probably a few days.
[12:11.93]He sure is taking his time.
[12:14.61]Did he fall in?
[12:17.55]Maybe you better go and take a look.
[12:21.34]I want to take the glasses off.
[12:22.50]It's ruining my remake.
[12:25.30]It's ruining my immersion in the remake.
[12:27.30]Watch the car.
[12:28.78]Wouldn't want to get a parking ticket.
[12:31.82]So much for helping me.
[12:38.24]Here we go.
[12:45.96]It looks pretty good.
[12:47.08]How does it run, though?
[12:48.44]Hold on.
[12:53.42]How does it run?
[12:59.45]It seems pretty clean, actually.
[13:05.29]I'm so glad I could turn the FOV up as well.
[13:12.36]It seems pretty clean.
[13:21.36]Wait, there's a jump scare right now, isn't there?
[13:23.36]Yeah, there is.
[13:23.96]Just to give a quick warning for everybody.
[13:26.09]Birds fly down and scare you in like five seconds from what I remember.
[13:30.41]How far could he have gone?
[13:32.59]In three, two, one.
[13:34.91]Cue the birds.
[13:39.19]Cue the... The birds are coming.
[13:42.45]Soon.
[13:46.48]I need to change that.
[13:52.88]Sorry, give me one second.
[13:56.14]E and F always need to be flipped for me.
[13:57.86]I don't know what happened in the last five years of gaming, but F replaced E for some reason.
[14:06.61]And I've been trying to figure out why for a long time.
[14:09.37]F replaced E, and it was always E. And I think it's because E started to become lean.
[14:13.93]I wanted E. Sorry.
[14:17.40]Sorry.
[14:23.14]Uh, key findings.
[14:26.27]Knife and parry, that's fine.
[14:27.31]Space.
[14:27.69]Pick up item.
[14:28.65]Examine.
[14:29.33]F?
[14:29.49]No, it's E. And melee is mouse button.
[14:34.55]Reload, that's fine.
[14:35.49]B and R. Isn't... Oh, ready knife.
[14:40.90]Okay.
[14:41.02]Okay.
[14:43.02]Attach, remove mines.
[14:44.44]G is fine.
[14:46.22]Move backwards.
[14:48.38]Move camera.
[14:48.92]Run is shift.
[14:49.38]That's fine.
[14:50.48]Crouch, stand, evade is C. Come on.
[14:53.86]What year is it?
[14:55.56]How come we've changed these things?
[14:56.56]We've been staples for years.
[14:58.74]Or control, right?
[15:00.24]What is control in the game?
[15:01.58]Command Ashley.
[15:02.40]Oh, okay.
[15:03.90]C. Alright, we're good.
[15:08.57]Unable to apply some changes.
[15:14.33]Wait, what?
[15:16.45]What was wrong?
[15:16.87]I don't know.
[15:21.34]Make this like... No, stop.
[15:23.86]I don't know.
[15:24.98]Make this like Y. We're good.
[15:29.51]Cut it out.
[15:33.63]E. There it is.
[15:34.77]And then melee.
[15:35.49]There we go.
[15:35.91]We're good.
[15:45.87]Oh, no, that wasn't it.
[15:47.59]Wasn't that it?
[15:48.07]That was fucking pretty scary.
[15:55.62]I remember this house.
[16:04.56]I wonder how much of this I truly remember, because it's actually been a fairly long time.
[16:09.06]The last time I actually played through Resident Evil 4, I mean, it has to be
[16:16.71]10 years has to be 10 years.
[16:20.14]Maybe a little less.
[16:21.10]Maybe I don't.
[16:21.74]I don't know, maybe a little more.
[16:26.14]It looks great though.
[16:28.80]I'm so glad I avoided all the footage anyone home.
[16:33.74]Might be a little too loud.
[16:35.88]But it's OK, we'll figure that out.
[17:05.84]Should I pretend like I've never played this before?
[17:07.26]That's probably a good idea, right?
[17:11.41]Just pretend like I've never played this.
[17:14.37]Because then the YouTube video will be so much better.
[17:16.65]And I'll get so many more engagements.
[17:41.69]This place looks so much different now.
[17:45.21]It's crazy.
[17:50.11]This feels like a different game, even though I know it's not.
[17:56.87]Sorry to barge in like this.
[18:05.43]Busco a un Felicia.
[18:07.67]Vino aqui?
[18:11.20]Say it.
[18:12.48]Do it.
[18:14.22]We're all waiting for it.
[18:18.50]We're all waiting for it.
[18:31.05]That's loud.
[18:32.37]Sorry, I'll fix it.
[18:52.64]Okay, important.
[18:54.14]I know people, I know I'm breaking your immersion and breaking my immersion, but we got to get this right.
[18:58.91]I am a toggle aim down sights person.
[19:02.77]Now, I don't, I know that that offends a lot of people probably, but I don't care.
[19:06.75]Is it in the game?
[19:12.11]Cursor lock, control, no.
[19:15.87]Auto reload.
[19:16.95]I actually don't like that very much.
[19:18.11]I don't like that either.
[19:18.77]I don't like that either.
[19:21.92]But I'm going to do it.
[19:24.57]Aim assist off.
[19:26.93]Where would it be?
[19:29.61]Where would it be?
[19:32.15]What?
[19:32.35]Aim assist is off.
[19:35.32]You're literally a psycho.
[19:36.58]What?
[19:41.38]Is there a toggle aim downsides?
[19:48.21]It's in the camera settings.
[19:49.43]Okay.
[19:52.74]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[19:54.65]When aiming... This is camera inversion.
[20:01.05]Field of view.
[20:04.19]Where is it?
[20:06.43]Is it here?
[20:09.54]Field of view.
[20:10.80]Camera sensitivity.
[20:11.90]Camera inversion.
[20:13.10]Camera acceleration.
[20:14.88]Camera speed.
[20:15.86]I don't even know where it is.
[20:20.46]And controls.
[20:22.97]accessibility maybe control type quick turn type crouch type is toggle repeated input oh you got a toggle for crouch but no toggle for really no come on right just play I I that's how I like to play
[20:52.25]Is it actually not in the game?
[21:01.86]It's two to the right, down three in camera.
[21:24.78]Huh?
[21:28.78]Aim, uh, wait.
[21:29.70]Shit.
[21:34.10]Okay, well, whatever.
[21:37.44]I'll deal with it.
[21:39.96]That's alright.
[21:41.72]This sensitivity has to come way up, but, uh, and I'm gonna fix it.
[21:45.12]You do your settings.
[21:45.90]You do your settings.
[21:46.58]I couldn't get in here and do this before, because the preload, there's no preload.
[21:51.04]Just wait.
[21:51.38]Alright, sensitivity.
[22:01.69]Is it camera speed?
[22:08.56]These settings are kind of confusing.
[22:11.38]That's better.
[22:11.78]Alright, I might fix it later, but we're good.
[22:24.24]T. Those were controller settings.
[22:29.02]Turn up the FOV.
[22:29.84]FOV, is it at the highest it can go?
[22:32.51]I think it's a good spot.
[22:33.23]Alright, HUD looks good.
[22:41.55]Yep, okay.
[22:41.99]Let's go.
[22:52.62]Leon's jacket would be way too big for you.
[22:56.73]So order me a small.
[22:59.29]You can't get me a small police jacket?
[23:02.27]What are you talking about?
[23:03.85]Why would I put on somebody else's jacket?
[23:09.76]Creepy.
[23:10.02]I'm not extra small.
[23:13.22]I'm a men's small to medium.
[23:15.98]Don't change that.
[23:26.41]This game is fucked up.
[23:35.27]There's no way you're a small.
[23:42.28]I must.
[23:42.86]I am.
[23:43.14]I'm in small.
[23:44.78]Depends.
[23:56.77]Here it comes.
[23:58.21]Let me sip my tea before we get into this.
[24:09.46]Take the glasses off?
[24:11.34]Not yet.
[24:11.84]I'll leave them for one more cutscene.
[24:19.45]This is way scarier.
[24:20.75]What was that?
[24:26.06]This is way scarier.
[24:27.24]No fucking.
[24:42.78]See, before, I could hide behind the fact that the graphics weren't... I mean, the graphics were good at the time, but if you go back and play Resident Evil 4, it's like, oh, okay.
[24:53.77]Current-gen graphics makes this way scarier.
[24:55.67]I don't know why, it just does.
[25:15.96]Get away!
[25:18.24]Quiet.
[25:25.05]Shit, I'm so glad I didn't play on the fucking hardcore.
[25:28.03]I'm so glad I didn't play on hardcore.
[25:32.21]Wait, how do I do it?
[25:33.91]Oh, it's mouse button.
[25:37.97]It's mouse button.
[25:38.95]It's a thumb mouse button to do the melee execute, right?
[25:44.22]so glad I'm not playing on that hardcore when you're 35 and older you can pick this once you drop out of that okay any bracket that says hey how old are you uh what is your what what age are you in you know it's usually 18 to 34 right the second that you go over 35 plus like when you go to the next bracket just pick the regular difficulties there's no reason to was there anything else in here they needed
[26:15.38]you've changed yeah I've fucking aged you are correct you are you are absolutely correct I have changed ver I have changed a lot in the last 10 to 20 plus years I'm a little older now hey you kids don't even know don't you have to pull bookcases and stuff
[26:42.36]I don't want to spoil it for anybody, but... I'm trying to remember how this plays out.
[26:53.92]How many bullets left?
[27:14.14]Take the glasses off.
[27:18.46]Bruce, this is Condor One.
[27:21.22]Hunnigan here.
[27:21.84]What's your sitrep?
[27:23.47]President's daughter, Baby Eagle.
[27:25.83]It's likely she's in this village.
[27:28.79]Our intel was correct then.
[27:30.31]Well done.
[27:32.03]Need a location on a nearby lake.
[27:33.37]We'll do comedy mode later.
[27:35.67]Copy that.
[27:36.81]I'll see what I can find.
[27:38.17]Hurry up.
[27:39.85]Something's happened to the people here.
[27:42.57]My escorts are...
[27:45.71]Jesus.
[27:46.89]The audio is so much... They spent a lot of time on the audio.
[27:51.69]I don't have any bullets.
[27:54.57]Did I pick hardcore?
[27:55.73]I wanted to look directly into the camera and go... ...un forastero.
[28:15.51]Boom!
[28:16.15]Big music cue, you know what I mean?
[28:22.81]Just so we know what game we're playing.
[28:39.14]Glasses off.
[28:40.22]No, the glass is staying on.
[28:41.38]For at least 10 to 20 more minutes.
[28:56.23]That crow... That raven was as big as a dog.
[28:59.31]I think... Yeah, it's E. Yep.
[29:07.88]Handgun ammo.
[29:08.70]Good.
[29:09.34]Gonna need a lot of that.
[29:11.09]What do I want to upgrade, though?
[29:12.37]That's the thing.
[29:13.11]I always pick something different.
[29:26.89]Okay, save it.
[29:29.97]An attach case has been added to the customized case menu.
[29:34.36]Charm has been added to the customized case menu.
[29:36.78]A deluxe weapon has been added to the menu.
[29:40.66]Okay.
[29:47.75]Uh, this is cheating, isn't it?
[29:50.05]Isn't this- I have two free weapons?
[29:52.17]This is cheating.
[29:55.14]I got the deluxe edition.
[29:56.52]I'm a big fan.
[29:58.06]I got the deluxe edition.
[29:59.00]So what?
[30:00.60]We don't have to use it.
[30:01.70]I'm a big fan.
[30:02.52]So I got the deluxe edition.
[30:11.46]I won't use it.
[30:12.89]We need to stay true to the original.
[30:20.55]And I'm going to have a gold case because I think that's kind of cool.
[30:24.73]Increased drop rate?
[30:26.91]Wait.
[30:28.11]This is cheating.
[30:35.33]Increased drop rate for gunpowder?
[30:37.04]Increased drop rate?
[30:39.22]Wait.
[30:42.14]Wait, this is... The actual case does this too.
[30:47.52]Is this new?
[30:48.06]I don't remember this.
[30:54.04]Will those bonuses in the regular game?
[30:56.82]I'd rather the handgun ammo.
[31:02.38]Okay.
[31:02.99]Very good.
[31:03.25]Let's continue.
[31:18.38]Ooh.
[31:21.18]Very nice.
[31:21.64]Nice.
[31:25.72]This is the village part, isn't it?
[31:27.32]Alright.
[31:27.86]This is the first real test.
[31:43.55]Handgun ammo.
[31:45.35]Thank you.
[32:02.05]Do I even have the knife yet?
[32:03.17]I don't think I do.
[32:06.91]That's money.
[32:07.41]Ooh!
[32:33.76]Alright, so that's how you do the execute.
[32:35.64]Okay.
[32:37.52]Alright, that's how you do the execute.
[32:40.14]So you're gonna knock them down, then go over and stab them on the ground.
[32:43.48]Very cool.
[32:43.82]These people were friendly?
[32:46.02]Okay.
[33:02.10]I forgot these existed.
[33:03.42]I forgot!
[33:04.06]I think it's been 10 years since I played this.
[33:14.32]Oh my god!
[33:15.14]Somebody there?
[33:32.09]Alright, herbs in this game, you gotta combine them, right?
[33:38.94]Or did they streamline that somehow?
[33:41.98]Flash grenade.
[33:43.40]Change weapon.
[33:44.64]Okay, yep.
[33:45.18]Cool.
[33:47.80]I'm gonna save all those to the end of the game and throw them all at the T-Virus, whatever it is.
[33:54.58]So I'm gonna make sure.
[33:55.26]I probably will have like 30 or 40 flashbangs at the end of the game.
[34:00.74]Which is fine.
[34:17.81]Looks great.
[34:26.83]Cool.
[34:39.56]Shit.
[35:11.25]Why not?
[35:19.38]Here we go.
[35:22.12]Why?
[35:22.86]Why?
[35:23.28]Why?
[35:32.23]Oh my god.
[35:32.99]I don't... That's the worst place for that to be on my thumb button.
[35:44.46]Oh fuck.
[35:46.34]You're really hard to suppress this.
[35:57.43]Shit, I suck.
[36:00.13]What's quick turn?
[36:00.81]What's quick turn?
[36:01.47]It's Q.
[36:29.53]Yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep. Yep.
[36:39.53]You're fucked bro. No I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[36:47.53]This is so much scarier than the other one.
[36:51.00]It feels like too- it feels like more real somehow. I don't know why, it just does.
[36:57.00]Oh shit!
[37:07.49]Oh my god!
[37:26.11]This is not one of these guys in the original.
[37:29.65]Wait, was there?
[37:49.14]Whoa!
[37:52.06]Get out of my way!
[37:52.84]Get out of my way!
[37:54.22]Get out of my way!
[37:55.00]I should have picked Assistant.
[37:56.34]I should have picked Assistant.
[37:58.12]I should have picked Assistant.
[37:59.51]That was my fault.
[38:00.37]That was my fault.
[38:06.71]Oh my god, that's so much worse.
[38:21.91]I need ammo!
[38:28.18]Get the fuck out of my way!
[38:30.86]Oh shit!
[38:31.52]I have to change this keybind!
[38:50.59]How do I do it?
[38:52.57]It's five!
[38:53.51]Press five!
[38:54.09]Press five!
[38:59.76]How do I do it?
[39:01.90]How do I do it?
[39:03.52]Why can't I throw the grenade?
[39:05.34]How do I do it?
[39:09.34]Oh, fuck all of you in there?
[39:14.76]Oh, give me that!
[39:15.48]Give me that!
[39:15.82]I need that money!
[39:18.28]Oh, shit!
[39:28.91]I need more healing.
[39:34.68]How do I win?
[39:36.20]Don't you... There it is.
[39:39.01]Okay, I was saying, what the fuck?
[39:41.85]I was like, you gotta just live, man.
[39:47.67]I was gonna say, I feel like that took longer.
[40:10.01]That was so terrifying.
[40:11.30]It's so much worse now.
[40:12.74]I gotta collect all those items.
[40:51.29]Jeez.
[40:58.25]Where's everyone going?
[41:00.06]Bingo.
[41:06.70]That was awesome.
[41:07.80]That was actually really cool.
[41:13.72]I very, very vividly remember this part, but... Wow, that was... That was something else.
[41:20.94]Alright, so the issue is you have to get to here and then press 5.
[41:26.50]You don't just press 5.
[41:27.64]Wait, I can just press 5.
[41:29.28]Why wasn't this... That wasn't working before?
[41:31.93]I don't know.
[41:34.29]I was kind of panicking.
[41:35.09]Alright, let me explore first.
[41:37.03]I'm not doing good.
[41:41.57]Windmill.
[41:50.73]I look like shit.
[41:52.07]Okay, good.
[42:00.58]The map.
[42:04.30]You can become lost, you can check your map, position, and objectives on the map.
[42:07.86]If you have a treasure map, you'll be able to see the locations of hidden valuables.
[42:13.74]That's cool.
[42:17.80]I love these games.
[42:23.14]No, don't throw that.
[42:28.06]Reload the gun.
[42:28.74]Dude, take some ibuprofen or something.
[42:33.50]There's the shotgun.
[42:38.43]Oh, nice.
[42:43.51]Nice.
[42:46.75]Even if I take ibuprofen, it's going to take like 45 minutes for it to kick in.
[43:03.77]I actually, I am going to heal.
[43:04.93]Item crafting.
[43:05.59]Certain materials such as resources, gunpowder, and knives can be used to craft different items.
[43:09.17]The types of items that you can craft can be increased by obtaining new crafting recipes.
[43:14.59]This wasn't in the old one, was it?
[43:17.38]Maybe it was.
[43:20.56]Handgun and what is that?
[43:21.70]A burrito?
[43:24.68]What is that thing?
[43:37.79]I know.
[43:38.11]Just wait till you can do complete herbs.
[43:39.67]I don't know.
[43:40.05]It doesn't matter.
[43:40.51]I don't care.
[43:46.95]I should probably put... I'm just going to do this.
[43:48.51]Whatever.
[43:48.83]I should assign this.
[43:53.94]Oh, you can't.
[43:54.42]Okay.
[43:58.43]I'm gonna explore a little bit.
[43:59.54]I don't want to forget anything I don't want to leave anything and I know because everyone this is a beloved video game And everybody's played probably five times each all of us I'm gonna miss a treasure and it's gonna be spam in my chat people screaming at me because I missed it So I'm gonna do my best Very good I Know that there's they put the treasure on the map now, so there's one in here
[44:33.04]I've never played this before.
[44:33.88]I'm not 37.
[44:34.24]That's true for some of you, maybe.
[44:37.90]Does this hurt?
[44:42.46]No, I'm good.
[44:44.21]Alright, so the treasure's in here.
[44:45.75]Cupboard, maybe?
[44:48.61]No?
[44:52.45]How's the audio and visual?
[44:53.49]Is it brightness?
[44:55.89]You're blocking your health and ammo with your facecam.
[44:59.42]Oh.
[45:01.06]That's gotta be fixed.
[45:03.90]Is that better?
[45:04.32]That's better, right?
[45:08.38]A little too dark.
[45:10.54]Because I thought it was a little too dark when I was doing the initial setup.
[45:14.86]So I'm going to turn it up a little bit.
[45:19.30]If I do that.
[45:25.79]Good luck finding that.
[45:34.68]I don't have super resolution on.
[45:36.14]Wait, it was there?
[45:37.36]I missed it?
[45:38.27]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, I see.
[45:40.79]We'll go, like, we'll go up to the middle.
[45:42.53]I think that looks good.
[45:43.77]Is that better?
[45:45.27]It looks a little better.
[45:48.65]I don't have a key for this.
[45:49.58]Alright, there's one more over here, but it's a locked door, so I can't get in.
[45:53.66]Oh, that, it shows everything on the map now.
[45:56.86]That's actually incredibly useful.
[45:58.10]Okay.
[46:03.84]Where did I throw that grenade?
[46:04.97]Because I want to go in that room.
[46:08.35]It was in here.
[46:19.13]These people are sick.
[46:21.68]Yeah.
[46:25.38]Alright, so this is where I threw the grenade in here and there was a bunch of shit on the ground.
[46:30.62]Okay, nice.
[46:34.74]Cool.
[46:35.84]Think that that's everything.
[46:37.26]Now, I'm not going to get everything.
[46:39.10]I'm not going to get everything.
[46:40.38]People might expect, what, dude, you're not going to get everything?
[46:42.60]I'm not going to get everything.
[46:53.43]One more spot to look, which is in here.
[46:56.27]Can I go in here yet?
[46:58.33]I cannot.
[46:59.11]This is a little bit later.
[47:02.95]Get everything.
[47:03.83]I'm not going to get everything.
[47:05.33]No, no.
[47:07.39]I'm going to go up here and look.
[47:13.42]Can you please not stream till 3 a.m.
[47:14.78]again?
[47:16.04]I can't promise you anything.
[47:18.24]Alright.
[47:18.50]So over here, there's a treasure.
[47:25.93]My whole body hurts.
[47:27.39]Everything hurts.
[47:28.09]I just like had a heart attack in one second.
[47:31.41]I don't remember that happening.
[47:35.49]Ooh!
[47:39.95]Yep, you get gems.
[47:40.95]You combine them, so they're worth way more.
[47:42.37]Alright.
[47:48.31]I think we've got everything we needed from here.
[47:50.71]It's time to continue the playthrough.
[47:55.99]Plenty of ammo.
[47:57.39]Collected everything.
[47:58.13]Now we have to go back this way, right?
[48:05.50]I don't remember this.
[48:06.12]I don't remember that.
[48:06.74]I don't remember this.
[48:07.84]I don't remember that.
[48:08.38]Did I get everything in here?
[48:13.56]Nope.
[48:16.40]Ruby?
[48:17.74]That wasn't even on the map, and I got it.
[48:31.53]Please don't spend all the treasure you get on that Family Guy mobile game app.
[48:34.79]I can't promise that either.
[48:38.85]I drank all my tea already.
[48:40.49]Must be a stressful game.
[48:42.55]All the tea's gone.
[48:43.01]I'm gonna try to get a refill already.
[48:51.17]There it is.
[48:58.96]I gotta be way more conservative with shooting.
[49:05.48]Our resources.
[49:07.38]There we go.
[49:08.14]Now I can make some bullets if I want to.
[49:11.18]Go.
[49:16.11]It says standard, but I might be a bug in the game because I picked hardcore before starting, so.
[49:22.75]The game is hardcore.
[49:23.51]I think it's on hardcore, but just kind of says it isn't.
[49:25.29]I think it's a known bug.
[49:30.41]So how much better is this than the other shotgun?
[49:34.84]Can I look at the damage on it?
[49:41.85]Who cares?
[49:42.37]I'm gonna use him.
[49:43.57]Fuck it.
[49:43.93]Why not?
[49:47.83]Got some handgun made for Leon.
[49:51.68]Sentinel 9.
[49:56.82]It's cluttered now.
[49:57.80]I'll fix it.
[50:01.98]This is going to turn into the lawnmower bag when you're done at the end of the day.
[50:07.40]This is kind of just a bunch of cut grass in here.
[50:11.46]I'm a cheater.
[50:12.04]It's fine.
[50:14.91]That's fine.
[50:17.39]I'm going to put this on here.
[50:21.11]Okay.
[50:26.86]Okay.
[50:31.11]I'm not going to combine any of this.
[50:34.65]Yeah, this is fine.
[50:36.05]I'm going to put this over on... Yeah.
[50:41.31]There we go.
[50:41.69]Okay.
[50:46.49]This is a good bit.
[50:50.35]What's the bit?
[50:53.65]I mean, this is... I got this because I paid an extra $10 for the game.
[51:04.23]It's going to be cluttered.
[51:04.93]Ah, shit.
[51:05.81]You're right.
[51:06.23]No, whatever.
[51:06.91]I don't care.
[51:07.57]Not in the very beginning of the game like this.
[51:08.96]It's going to be fine.
[51:12.28]Let's just test it and see how it is.
[51:14.36]If I like it, I like it.
[51:34.35]Give me that.
[51:38.05]There's a jewel right here.
[51:46.77]Oops.
[52:00.11]Oh, eggs!
[52:01.11]Thanks for the...
[52:09.77]Oh, the deluxe gun is pretty good.
[52:19.01]There's bacon, lettuce, and tomato on this one.
[52:32.30]Blue request notes.
[52:34.02]You can take on tasks by collecting the blue request notes posted around the areas.
[52:40.45]Okay.
[52:43.93]Destroy all the blue medallions.
[52:45.43]I've only got three more.
[52:47.13]So, that's a good question.
[53:02.57]Good.
[53:07.15]I mean, this ain't a speedrun.
[53:08.67]So, hold on.
[53:10.68]This ain't a speedrun.
[53:20.48]Hurry up, hurry up.
[53:21.28]This ain't a speedrun.
[53:26.10]I want to check all this out.
[53:27.09]I'm not trying to go as fast as I can.
[53:41.39]Alright, it shows where they are.
[53:48.03]That's useful, I guess.
[53:51.28]You don't have to really look for them.
[54:01.46]Is this because it's a deluxe treasure map?
[54:03.50]You have the cheater map.
[54:04.42]It's because you paid for it.
[54:06.86]Really?
[54:07.16]Is that for real?
[54:12.00]I have the cheater map?
[54:16.14]Are you serious?
[54:17.26]That's actually, whatever.
[54:18.35]I have the cheater map.
[54:23.19]Oh, I do.
[54:27.45]Hey.
[54:33.48]When you get to be 35 and older.
[54:37.08]Sorry.
[54:37.70]I didn't get the cheater map.
[54:38.68]Sorry.
[54:41.76]So then that, where's this one then?
[54:45.40]Up here?
[54:45.82]Right there.
[54:48.70]So what do I get?
[54:49.32]Hey, I got it.
[54:54.11]Challenge complete.
[55:05.13]I want that.
[55:08.28]Where is this lady?
[55:11.86]Where is this lady?
[55:12.62]I don't know.
[55:21.98]Alright.
[55:27.88]Let's go.
[55:37.88]I see it.
[55:38.70]Okay, I know I was pretending that I couldn't see it.
[55:55.17]Remember, the cheater map just turned this from a 30-hour playthrough to a 130-hour playthrough.
[56:03.39]Kind of true.
[56:04.77]Because I'm going to be like, oh, look, there's one.
[56:06.20]I'm going to go that way and go get that.
[56:17.52]I need to look at the map a lot, though.
[56:19.26]I'm a map user.
[56:20.23]Uh-oh.
[56:21.53]Oh.
[56:36.90]Somebody bought the deluxe edition.
[56:38.64]Sorry.
[56:51.99]Let me see the other deluxe edition.
[56:55.15]Cool.
[57:02.13]Alright, need to get a gear.
[57:03.05]Mhm.
[57:25.29]Is there anything else I missed in here?
[57:37.23]That is... What is that drop down?
[57:42.36]That's where the chest is, isn't it?
[57:49.48]Ask the cheater map.
[57:50.40]Maybe it'll know.
[57:54.04]Oh, interesting.
[57:54.68]Yeah, down here.
[57:56.08]No, I knew where this was.
[57:57.38]I looked at it.
[57:57.78]Get the barrels.
[58:02.09]I will.
[58:05.09]Ooh, nice.
[58:07.43]I didn't look at the cheater map.
[58:08.33]This I saw through the door.
[58:09.05]What the fuck was that?
[58:33.80]Get your knife.
[58:34.38]There's the fog.
[58:40.02]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[58:43.14]Get out of here!
[59:07.15]Come on, come on up.
[59:21.96]Get out.
[59:22.38]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[59:30.19]Oh, shit.
[59:43.76]Get away from me.
[59:45.26]Oh, shit.
[59:45.68]Is he up?

[63:17.96]Plus, this light is shining over here.
[63:31.60]Yeah, I'm E3 walking.
[63:32.70]That's fine.
[63:35.72]It's been like 30 years since I've seen this game.
[63:37.80]And I'm going to enjoy it.
[63:39.09]I'm doing it the way I want to go.
[63:41.25]The pace that I'm going to go.
[63:42.17]And if you don't like my E3 walking, then you know what?
[63:50.57]You can... I don't know.
[63:56.17]Something annoying.
[64:17.88]There we go I knew it
[64:56.08]I don't even need to fight you.
[64:56.85]What do I care?
[64:58.35]Let's go the right way over here.
[65:02.38]They're gonna miss every time, so who cares?
[65:24.02]Oh, that was brutal.
[65:25.02]What happened to my knife?
[65:42.24]What's wrong with my knife?
[65:44.88]The knife breaks?
[65:52.28]I didn't know that... Wait, the knife breaks now.
[65:54.09]Did it break before?
[65:54.81]I don't remember that.
[65:55.35]I don't remember this.
[65:56.37]I don't remember this thing.
[65:57.07]I don't know.
[65:57.49]Do I remember this?
[65:58.01]I don't remember.
[65:58.49]It's so dark in here.

[66:11.94]Come on, Leon.
[66:12.44]Take it out.
[66:13.74]Please point your flashlight out here.
[66:44.95]Oh, you have a thing that's going to explode.
[66:46.95]Come on dude.
[67:14.13]Did I just aggro everybody?
[67:15.59]Oh no, that's not good.
[67:28.97]Oh shit.
[67:32.31]Oh, he made the fucking head!
[67:50.70]What was that?
[67:51.42]What did I just do?
[67:52.20]I just Dark Souls parried that guy.
[67:55.90]Really?
[67:56.40]Wait, hold on.
[68:01.12]Well, that's awesome.
[68:07.75]Oh, wait, you can't parry it.
[68:23.21]That's actually really cool.
[68:25.49]What's this?
[68:25.83]Somebody's what's that sound?
[68:40.92]What's going on?
[68:47.21]You hear that right?
[68:57.23]Shit I have.
[69:14.85]Oh, grenade.

[69:46.46]On the roof?
[69:59.22]You throw that in here, I'm gonna be pissed.
[70:01.79]Oh!
[70:11.66]You can actually get it in here.
[70:13.07]Okay.
[70:36.74]What?
[70:45.53]Where are these people?
[70:52.16]Oh!
[71:14.43]What's going on?
[71:15.53]Why did I not?
[71:20.29]That was weird.
[71:25.36]Get up off me with this fucking thumb.
[71:27.04]I gotta take this off of thumb one.
[71:29.94]I take it off of thumb one.
[71:32.09]I'm sitting here going like this.
[71:45.14]Am I all the way back here?
[71:47.46]Dude, okay.
[71:48.48]Like... Melee... I like it on there, though.
[71:58.16]Can I just make it V?
[72:03.56]Wait, secondary.
[72:05.88]V. So I can just go...
[72:14.29]Open map is M. Okay, so if I tap... I can tap V pretty quickly then.
[72:23.15]Wait, what?
[72:32.53]That's... Okay, I gotta... Why do I hear beeps?
[72:54.66]WHOA!
[72:57.52]Why would you throw that over here, dude?
[72:59.60]We're fuckin' dead!
[73:00.49]Yeah, put that down!
[73:40.20]Oh, my eyes hurt!
[74:02.64]Ow!
[74:02.92]I blocked it!
[74:03.46]Holy shit, I'm phenomenal!
[74:29.80]Stop wasting so much!
[74:32.73]What happened?
[74:37.67]Okay, everybody chill.
[74:40.13]Chill out for a second.
[74:41.71]For one second.
[74:46.39]Oh my god.
[74:50.78]Don't back up!
[74:52.28]Don't back up.
[74:53.24]If I back up, I'm fucking dead.
[75:00.77]Okay.
[75:04.69]Jeez.
[75:07.20]I'm gonna eat this egg.
[75:08.10]I have so much bullshit in here.
[75:11.12]I'm gonna make some... I like shotguns.
[75:14.70]So I'm gonna do shotgun ammo.
[75:20.51]Oh, wait a minute.
[75:21.01]I can do... I can combine this.
[75:27.29]so this would be a suit that's cool that you can do this before you couldn't do it I'm gonna do it because that would be uh red um green yellow I could do this but I don't think I want to
[75:47.67]It's always good to do all of it.
[75:49.33]Because when you do all three, it increases your max health, right?
[75:52.98]Yes.
[75:53.72]Very important.
[75:55.10]If you do all three... Can you guys even see me?
[75:58.76]I'm so dark.
[76:01.20]Can you guys even see me?
[76:06.03]Alright, that should free up some space.
[76:07.07]You know what?
[76:14.06]Just...
[76:19.16]Is this... This is storage, right?
[76:22.07]Or is this me throwing it on the ground?
[76:25.13]No, I know that.
[76:25.65]Okay, I see, I see.
[76:27.15]Let me get this right.
[76:32.89]Inventory management time.
[76:42.20]This thing is broken.
[76:43.00]Hmm.
[76:58.65]So I know that people like to say that however your inventory management is in Resident Evil games is like you're taking a Myers-Briggs personality test.
[77:07.99]So I don't know what you guys can decipher from this, but this is how I do it.
[77:20.91]Auto sort.
[77:23.89]Why would I?
[77:24.71]No, I want to do it.
[77:27.23]I like it.
[77:48.06]Much cleaner looking.
[77:50.56]Much cleaner.
[77:51.16]Alright, we're good.
[78:01.00]Now auto-sort it and ruin it.
[78:05.78]So what did I get for personality?
[78:06.78]What do you think?
[78:13.99]Somebody said this is an average TikToker.
[78:17.41]Awful.
[78:22.13]Normie.
[78:26.67]Normie will bring everything?
[78:27.69]Is that true?
[78:37.94]ENFP.
[78:46.49]Yeah, ENFP.
[78:48.31]Exactly.
[78:50.69]I don't die.
[78:51.43]This is where I lost before.
[78:52.59]Can I get around there?
[78:57.93]Because somebody died up there.
[79:00.86]Yes, I can.
[79:13.03]Good.
[79:15.51]Good.
[79:16.43]Very good.
[79:16.99]I got a lot of money.
[79:17.63]Alright, let's take a look at the cheating menu.
[79:22.84]Take something cool over there.
[79:28.50]That's not hurting me.
[79:31.52]Anything back here?
[79:32.08]No.
[79:32.64]Got everything.
[79:51.15]It looks really, really good.
[79:52.79]I don't even have every setting turned on either.
[79:57.29]It looks... Oh, get those glasses off.
[80:07.05]Hero filter.
[80:18.36]Imagine playing with that on the whole game.
[80:20.34]What about the villain filter?
[80:21.36]I just feel like I have low health.
[80:30.20]Okay.
[80:36.18]Well, that's a nice... It's alright.
[80:38.52]I don't think I'm going to turn that on.
[80:53.31]I gotta use Q more often.
[80:55.23]The quick turn just saves your life so many times.
[80:57.59]I love the parry.
[80:58.59]Alright, now I'm understanding where hardcore could have been alright.
[81:03.21]The parry is a very interesting addition.
[81:05.53]Anything else?
[81:14.34]No, I can't open this.
[81:19.82]Shoot the water.
[81:21.90]Shoot the water.
[81:22.60]Shoot the water.
[81:23.24]Shoot the water.
[81:24.04]Wait.
[81:29.76]Shoot the water.
[81:31.90]Why?
[81:42.08]LOL.
[81:42.62]LOL.
[81:43.14]LOL.
[81:44.70]Why do I have... Alright.
[81:46.84]Hold on a second.
[81:51.94]no I I think don't in that no no no no no no no no I know I know and I'm not starting this whole section over again I know what happens I'm not starting the whole section over you can have a laugh all you want I'm not going to start the whole section over is there a safe point I'll just for other people the safe point is so far away I've never seen it before please just do it
[82:31.62]Wrong spot.
[82:39.41]You're wasting bolt.
[82:40.07]What do you mean wrong spot?
[82:48.45]It's the end of the pier.
[82:54.34]It takes 10 shots.
[82:57.46]What?
[82:57.76]What?
[83:10.75]making this up this is not even the right dock is this the wrong dock it might not even be in the remake
[83:41.26]Did I just shoot like 20 bullets for no reason?
[83:44.36]It's the wrong dock.
[83:48.02]It's the wrong dock.
[83:49.32]Wrong lake.
[83:54.30]I didn't need that ammo anyways.
[83:55.46]Who cares?
[83:57.38]It's the wrong game.
[83:59.04]Dude, you know what?
[83:59.94]It's the wrong game.
[84:00.78]Well, that's... I didn't even need the bullets.
[84:10.42]I'm fine.
[84:12.63]Look, it's literally one packet of bullets.
[84:15.01]I'll be fine.
[84:18.03]Look, I just replaced them already.
[84:20.17]Everything's fine.
[84:27.87]It's okay.
[84:28.19]I have the deluxe... Somebody said to take the deluxe glasses off.
[84:31.06]That's how I can see everything.
[84:34.02]The HUD by deluxe glasses.
[84:36.56]Now I can't take them off.
[84:50.87]How do I blow this up reliably?
[85:00.92]I guess I'm alright.
[85:33.67]Damn it.
[85:38.43]Heck.
[85:42.52]Check all the... everywhere.
[85:44.36]Isn't there shit under here or something?
[85:50.85]What's that noise?
[86:26.16]That parry is... That parry is so fucking cool.
[86:30.77]What an insane addition they added.
[86:33.55]That's awesome.
[86:35.49]You could probably play through this whole game in parry.
[86:38.07]You broke the knife again?
[86:38.83]It doesn't matter.
[86:42.33]Was it... It was in the other one?
[86:43.47]No, it wasn't?
[86:55.56]Probably missed a few things, but okay.
[86:59.86]Can you parry the chainsaw?
[87:01.55]That is a great question.
[87:02.73]I have no idea.
[87:03.41]That's a good question, though.
[87:04.81]I'm kind of too afraid to do that.
[87:05.97]It kills you in like one or two hits.
[87:21.30]I need another tea.
[87:23.56]That hurts, you know?
[87:24.64]Seemed like you really wanted to talk.
[87:26.86]How observant, señor.
[87:28.46]Now, uh, say, uh, you got a smoke?
[87:31.52]I know those things will kill you.
[87:33.08]Oh.
[87:33.66]Well, maybe just untie me then, huh?
[87:38.88]Joder!
[87:39.56]Not this guy!
[88:03.51]Guys, what happened?
[88:11.75]Oh my God, guys.
[88:13.61]Alright, give me the results.
[88:33.02]Completion points.
[88:35.36]Cool.
[88:42.92]Cool.
[88:43.20]Cool.
[88:43.48]Cool.
[88:43.90]Enemies killed 42.
[88:44.98]One death.
[88:45.42]71% accuracy.
[88:45.96]That's pretty good.
[88:51.45]Not bad.
[88:51.91]That's not bad accuracy.
[89:00.57]I'm going to take out some of these other items.
[89:03.51]Can I pull the handgun ammo out of this?
[89:06.61]Maybe I'll want to use it.
[89:07.41]I mean, if I'm going to have the DLC glasses on, I'm going to keep, you know, whatever.
[89:10.87]I need to see what the power levels are.
[89:15.44]Can you see that eventually?
[89:21.94]Don't you eventually upgrade and it tells you how much damage it does?
[89:23.92]It's in the store.
[89:31.66]That's
[89:40.70]check when you examine it sacrificial lamb you will receive our most sacred body it begins now different voice actor different uh different voice actor oh what the hey stop it hey yankee got a name leon

[90:19.72]Hey!
[90:20.80]Stop it!
[90:21.64]You move, I move.
[90:24.26]And I'm beat up enough as it is.
[90:28.34]I can see your thinking.
[90:31.92]Bet you've been in spots like this before.
[90:33.64]I guess you're here looking for someone.
[90:40.14]One more guess.
[90:41.16]Maybe some missing senorita?
[90:45.09]Young girl.
[90:47.75]Talk.
[90:48.99]Now.
[90:49.99]Alright.
[90:51.09]See.
[90:52.15]Heard chatter about moving, senorita.
[90:55.25]I said saw a trap.
[90:57.37]Where?
[90:57.79]Who knows?
[90:58.97]But later, saw some men dragging someone to the old church building.
[91:09.16]I'm back
[91:40.92]Hey, we're not done here.
[91:43.38]Do you guys think they're going to remake this game in 20 years?
[91:46.24]What do you think?
[91:49.57]Shit, they took my gear.
[91:58.93]Maybe they took everything.
[92:11.82]Didn't take the glasses.
[92:19.01]Condor Wonder Roost.
[92:20.41]I've located Baby Eagle.
[92:22.35]It sounds like she's being kept in some church.
[92:24.99]Great.
[92:25.95]That's good news.
[92:27.55]I heard it from this guy I met.
[92:29.43]Said his name is Luis Serra.
[92:32.58]There's something fishy about him.
[92:34.90]I need you to run a background check.
[92:37.17]Chapter 2.
[92:37.39]So I have nothing.
[92:37.79]Head for the church.
[92:38.49]I don't want to spoil it or anything, but...
[93:13.05]I don't want to spoil it, but... What do you mean?
[93:18.15]Is that later?
[93:18.59]I feel like that was early.
[93:22.81]Like, very beginning.
[93:30.37]What?
[93:30.61]I didn't say anything.
[93:32.09]For those that know, I'm just curious where it is.
[93:35.84]Wide sweeping slash attack.
[93:37.26]You can also do the quick stab while holding space.
[93:41.44]Oh.
[94:08.05]Yep.
[94:18.58]The lighting is... gorgeous.
[94:23.63]Nice stuff.
[94:46.45]I don't know.
[94:46.75]I just was trying to lock... I just tried to lock onto this guy.
[94:51.15]I just... How do I... Where's my lock on?
[94:53.03]If you have a knife, you can parry.
[94:56.51]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[94:57.43]Yep, yep, yep.
[94:59.97]Time it right.
[95:01.76]Wait, so this is a prompt?
[95:03.94]I'm just that good.
[95:04.92]I don't even need the prompt.
[95:22.18]I'm just that good.
[95:28.94]Yeah.
[95:29.34]What difficulty are you playing on?
[95:33.78]It's none of your business.
[95:38.73]I don't want you to see my menu.
[95:40.13]You know what I mean?
[95:41.25]Like, this is none of your business.
[95:43.65]Okay?
[95:43.85]Okay.
[95:45.40]This is none of your business.
[95:47.77]This is my menu.
[96:03.64]Almost walked in it.
[96:04.34]Can I open it from here?
[96:07.12]No.
[96:14.42]Check the cheater map.
[96:39.11]Stealth kill.
[96:40.23]Where's my shit?
[96:58.69]He's a little confused.
[98:19.12]Beautiful game.
[98:26.51]There we go.
[98:27.37]All my stuff.
[98:29.01]Exactly where I placed it.
[98:30.38]Uh-oh.
[98:59.98]Combine the herbs.
[99:00.88]No, I can't.
[99:03.68]I need red, green, yellow.
[99:06.57]I can't combine these.
[99:07.39]I need them.
[99:08.81]Combine an herb.
[99:09.49]No, I don't want to.
[99:12.33]Combine them.
[99:13.11]Stop hoarding.
[99:14.66]I could do two, but wait a minute.
[99:28.20]Oh, red.
[99:29.32]Okay, red just does more heal.
[99:31.96]I could do two green and one yellow.
[99:36.40]You have seven.
[99:37.47]Scroll down.
[99:46.31]Hey, everybody relax!
[99:58.03]Hey, relax.
[100:00.88]Red with green is a full heal.
[100:02.16]Three green is also a full heal.
[100:04.20]Two green and a yellow.
[100:05.10]Yeah, relax.
[100:05.92]We're fine.
[100:06.30]Can I actually not get through here?
[100:19.09]Alright, I got all my stuff.
[100:21.17]Now we gotta go through here.
[100:28.43]Oh, is this some?
[100:30.65]Over here, stranger.
[100:35.23]Who's that?
[100:37.53]Thank you.
[100:41.49]Let's do some business then, eh?
[100:48.27]Get rid of the rats that have taken up in the factory.
[100:51.05]We don't know if any are carrying any diseases.
[100:55.46]Did I get these three spinals from before?
[101:03.42]Where would they be?
[101:13.98]Can I do this wrong?
[101:22.94]Can I screw this up?
[101:26.01]Oh, maybe I shouldn't do it yet then.
[101:27.87]What did I get?
[101:28.51]Spinels?
[101:29.28]Spinels?
[101:29.98]What are they?
[101:31.16]I got three of them.
[101:35.74]Is it three?
[101:36.24]Do I have to claim it somewhere?
[101:42.88]No, you didn't.
[101:43.78]The merchant will give them to you.
[101:45.14]Oh, okay.
[101:48.14]Get rich quick.
[101:50.08]You know that you can trade the... Okay.
[101:52.19]Okay.
[101:59.76]I don't need to buy this.
[102:08.06]Welcome.
[102:10.96]Weapons and items can be bought or sold to the merchant using PITAS.
[102:15.40]You can also upgrade or repair your weapons and equipment.
[102:17.98]Yes, you can.
[102:19.52]Merchant request.
[102:20.22]Once you've completed a task received from blue request note, you can claim the reward by talking to the merchant.
[102:25.53]Nice work.
[102:27.15]You get to the point where your neck is like, you just need to just like, you can't get the air it is.
[102:33.13]Okay, we're good.
[102:33.54]Alright, I got it.
[102:35.02]I've got something new for you, mates.
[102:40.82]Ooh.
[102:43.60]What's that?
[102:44.54]Should I get this?
[102:45.08]How have we procured these curiosities?
[102:48.26]Punisher.
[102:49.42]You don't want to know.
[102:51.74]Yellow herb or yellow diamond.
[103:01.85]The items that no longer serve a purpose can be sold to the merchant.
[103:04.67]I'll buy almost anything.
[103:07.81]What does it tell you that it doesn't serve a purpose anymore?
[103:12.42]We probably wouldn't be on this list if that were the case, right?
[103:17.24]Thank you.
[103:24.54]I could sell this for $7,500.
[103:29.44]Okay.
[103:30.24]Your valuables won't do you much good.
[103:33.10]We're selling only... Okay, so you just sell these.
[103:39.09]These can be inserted.
[103:41.27]So I got Ruby Sapphire.
[103:43.91]Maybe they can go in the flagon.
[103:44.85]4,000 bucks to repair the knife.
[103:49.00]Alright, this is what I needed to look at.
[103:50.46]This is 1.0.
[103:50.92]It's 1.10.
[104:08.10]So they're both the same exact power.
[104:10.09]This one just costs more to upgrade.
[104:11.37]If I upgrade this, they both go to 130.
[104:16.83]10.
[104:16.85]19.
[104:19.87]Reload speed is 1.
[104:20.92]9.
[104:22.58]It actually is just better.
[104:24.36]Rate of fire, 1.
[104:24.96]Rate of fire.
[104:26.02]This is slower, though.
[104:28.20]Wait.
[104:29.76]1 point.
[104:30.04]No, that's faster.
[104:32.75]This is just a better handgun.
[104:38.41]listen to the chat what what are you talking about sell all you wait wait wait what's going on soft lock not locked stop reading nerd nerd nerd what happened what's going on time is money mate ah this is how you compare what what's going on what do you mean
[105:10.28]Does this fit here?
[105:16.45]Should I do this?
[105:21.07]Red and blue?
[105:23.03]That's fine, right?
[105:26.13]Press shift.
[105:30.41]You can redo it.
[105:32.51]Red and red is worth more.
[105:35.77]Then I can't do red, yellow, and blue in the other one.
[105:39.90]Yeah, it said I didn't need the key.
[105:44.10]You can take them out.
[105:47.70]Okay.
[105:48.02]3,000.
[105:50.97]Plus 3,000.
[105:51.61]So remove them.
[105:53.27]So this is plus 4,000.
[106:02.70]Two color bonus is worth more.
[106:05.24]Okay.
[106:06.12]Let's go.
[106:07.20]That's worth more.
[106:10.60]you get the bonus or save them no why not the duo bonus is better is it no but but that three thousand three thousand do a bonus times one point two is twelve thousand that's four thousand this is worth more it's worth more by a hundred
[106:41.70]That's worth more than by 100.
[106:42.58]It's a difference of 100.
[106:48.46]Wow.
[106:49.38]Well, only 100.
[106:50.08]It's still more.
[106:52.24]That might be the one bullet that I shoot at the boss and kill it.
[107:00.13]Save the sapphire.
[107:00.95]You know what?
[107:01.41]I'm like so paranoid.
[107:03.05]I hate doing these.
[107:07.45]We're pulling them all out.
[107:10.69]Because I know there's other shit that I can do later.
[107:13.29]Alright, let me compare these weapons.
[107:25.08]Okay.
[107:26.94]So, I mean, I'm going to use the DLC gun.
[107:34.02]I know people might be very upset with me.
[107:35.78]Alright, so what about this?
[107:42.46]Hours lower on the sunglasses gun.
[107:48.96]Reload speed is much faster.
[107:50.76]Rate of fire is faster, but really not that big of a deal.
[107:53.68]The regular one's better.
[107:55.18]I think I'm going to use Sentinel-9.
[108:00.62]Look at the ammo on it.
[108:05.15]It's all going to get replaced anyways.
[108:07.41]Maybe I just won't upgrade anything and just have like a million dollars at the end of the stream.
[108:18.41]This is where decisions come out though.
[108:19.79]I need it.
[108:20.57]Bolt thrower.
[108:21.05]Yeah, fuck it.
[108:21.75]I'm not even gonna upgrade.
[108:49.47]Why not try your hand at a new gun, stranger?
[108:53.63]Might save your life.
[108:56.87]A well-tuned weapon can make up for a lack of skill, friend.
[109:05.50]DLC Andy.
[109:09.34]Alright, I gotta breathe in once.
[109:16.81]I'm using the DLC gun.
[109:18.80]This kind of work is about finesse, stranger.
[109:22.70]Little bit goes a long way.
[109:25.46]You'll see.
[109:26.40]Welding.
[109:27.34]What can I do you for?
[109:28.70]I'll hold these for now.
[109:29.61]Don't get yourself killed now.
[109:35.63]I need a storage tank.
[109:38.11]Is there one over here somewhere?
[109:42.71]There it is.
[109:45.80]Brave streamer using the deluxe pay-to-win gun.
[109:51.08]Hey.
[109:53.69]I did breathe in.
[109:54.87]And I was like, okay, I gotta... I gotta, like, take a breath here.
[109:59.99]Whatever.
[110:03.11]How do I... Oh, move.
[110:05.67]Okay.
[110:11.12]How do I move it?
[110:17.29]Storage.
[110:18.23]Oh, you have to... Okay.
[110:24.84]Discard.
[110:25.56]No, I want to move it.
[110:34.38]I want to move these.
[110:35.07]I don't want to discard them.
[110:40.07]This is good for now, and I'm going to do some... Let's auto-sort.
[110:43.01]I wouldn't even do it like that.
[110:46.06]It's ugly.
[110:46.74]I don't like it at all, but I'll stay with it for now.
[110:55.03]You can't read simple instructions.
[110:56.15]No, I didn't.
[110:56.65]I had to click on it first.
[110:59.67]I thought I could just like drag it over.
[111:00.71]Sell the guns that you're not going to use, but I don't, I'm not sure yet.
[111:07.23]I'm certain of this one.
[111:08.92]I got to move these two, by the way.
[111:19.09]Okay.
[111:19.61]That's much better.
[111:21.21]One and two.
[111:22.86]More ammo in this gun.
[111:24.52]Gotta get the eagle.
[111:26.62]Alright.
[111:28.06]I am good.
[111:28.80]That was fun.
[111:32.94]What about the rodents?
[111:33.76]Mmm...
[111:54.93]Maybe on another playthrough.
[112:04.96]Maybe playthrough number two.
[112:22.91]Glasses off.
[112:23.75]Glasses off.
[112:25.31]Glasses on.
[112:35.60]Yeah, wait a minute.
[112:44.56]Hmm.
[112:44.66]Let's go.
[113:10.39]Take it in.
[113:15.15]I'm going to get swarmed if I don't.
[113:16.97]Alright, we're going to go.
[113:22.57]Yellow.
[113:36.27]Yellow.
[114:10.13]We're fine.
[114:10.75]Shut up.
[114:13.99]What the hell are you doing?
[114:20.64]Why would you do that?
[114:25.64]Over...
[114:44.96]Reactor stop saying that right now.
[114:48.77]Oh How did you you've got to be kidding me I
[115:15.54]That was like a 55 minute fuse.
[115:38.33]Overreactor.
[115:42.60]Instead of the react harder, it's cool down.
[115:45.37]Cool down.
[115:45.67]Do it.
[116:13.99]You make Leon look bad.
[116:16.91]Um... No, I'm fine.
[116:21.26]God.

[123:13.49]Do your homework.
[123:39.43]Oh, it wants me to... Okay.
[123:42.03]I've just... I don't know how the controls worked.
[123:47.96]No, no, no, no, no!
[123:48.78]I just confirmed it.
[123:49.56]Space is confirmed.
[123:50.36]I'm trying to just push it.
[124:03.35]I swear to God, it's... Listen to me.
[124:06.11]It's the A and D and Q and E. I...
[124:09.82]I promise you, I'm not... I know how I'm supposed to do this.
[124:13.62]I promise.
[124:14.86]It's just the weird, like, A and E, Q and... You know what I mean?
[124:19.54]It's... I promise I understood how that was working.
[124:35.83]Late night, huh?

[125:26.87]I hope you guys are relaxing.
[125:27.93]Hope you guys are having a good day.
[125:30.24]Killing with some Resident Evil 4.
[125:32.82]Oh, no.
[125:33.42]Don't come over here and don't... Oh, you already stepped in it.
[125:42.67]Distance between me and you.
[125:44.65]No, you idiot.
[125:45.47]I'm trying to...
[125:59.81]Who's even next to me?
[126:01.07]I... Don't you... You punched me in the face!
[126:29.06]The traps are the hardest enemy in the game.
[126:36.18]Oh, shit.
[126:36.52]We did have a couple of raids.
[126:37.32]We had... Nesawa came with a raid.
[126:41.31]Thanks, Nesawa.
[126:43.39]How long ago was that?
[126:43.99]Was that a long time ago?
[126:45.21]No, like five minutes.
[126:47.33]Standard mode, by the way.
[126:53.67]What?
[126:55.79]What?
[126:56.03]Oh, no.
[126:56.41]Oh, no.
[127:01.77]Yeah, automated too.
[127:03.21]Thanks, Otto.
[127:10.19]Wait, I want that.
[127:10.79]I want that chest refreshed.
[127:18.07]How do I get there?
[127:21.13]Don't miss the ammo.
[127:21.75]Is there a way I can go around?
[127:33.02]How do I get that?
[127:33.54]Ooh, resources large.
[127:47.20]There it is.
[127:48.86]Wrong button.
[127:52.71]Red herb.
[127:57.81]Sorry about those sapphires.
[128:00.39]Mm-hmm Mm-hmm Mm-hmm
[128:39.80]I want to do a quick poll.
[128:41.07]Do you sprint or walk through games like this?
[128:47.11]Destroy the wind-up dolls.
[128:48.33]Do not forgive those aristocrats.
[129:00.58]Oh yeah, you do enough of these and... Is there a lawnmower?
[129:15.62]Oh, dad's out there mowing.
[129:24.91]No, is there anything?
[129:25.69]Come on, hold on.
[129:28.85]God damn it.
[129:49.07]Yeah, alright.
[130:06.15]They put them here to fucking... for me to hit.
[130:10.28]You know what I mean?
[130:11.28]These are here for me to hit.
[130:14.66]Like, they perfectly placed all these on the exact route that I take.
[130:19.28]And I'm just so absent-minded.
[130:20.96]There's nothing I can do about it.
[130:22.75]How far back am I?
[130:23.55]Somebody said that was a mobile game ad.
[130:36.53]Yeah, it was.
[130:39.41]That's so accurate for what just happened.
[130:41.85]The only problem is it wasn't at x3 speed.
[130:46.07]You need to speed that up to x10 speed.
[130:58.77]Fuck, dude.
[131:01.29]75% sprint.
[131:03.99]Wait, don't... I gotta get the items again.
[131:05.83]Did I get the chest?
[131:10.00]I think I got the chest at this point, right?
[131:11.76]Alright, let's go, dude.
[131:18.62]I'm gonna kill this motherfucker.
[131:21.19]What the fuck are you doing?
[131:22.03]You're a silly goose.
[131:23.11]It's okay.
[131:26.09]I got the chest, right?
[131:26.95]Let me check the treasures.
[131:31.38]I did.
[131:31.62]Get the doll.
[131:37.36]I got it.
[131:39.82]Alright, let's go.
[131:40.68]I want to kill this because they usually drop something good, so I'm not going to run away.
[131:43.00]I'm going to waste a bunch of ammo.
[131:45.12]Let's go.
[131:47.99]Come on.
[131:59.62]Where did you come from?
[132:00.40]Wait, they... Oh, no, no, no.
[132:01.44]I'm running.
[132:01.74]Never mind.
[132:07.41]Whoa!
[132:07.71]I forgot they're right behind you.
[132:16.92]Oh, shit!
[132:17.20]He...
[132:47.20]Get out of my way!
[132:48.02]Get out!
[132:48.34]You're blocking the movie!
[132:49.38]Get out of the way!
[133:02.84]Alright, no more screaming.
[133:12.29]It's midnight.
[133:13.25]I don't want to sprint.
[133:13.79]No more screaming.
[133:14.53]I gotta stop screaming.
[133:22.33]This is the point where we have to stop screaming.
[133:25.55]Midnight.
[133:27.08]It's like 3 a.m.
[133:27.66]for a lot of you.
[133:28.64]Sometimes it's like 5 a.m.
[133:29.54]for some of you.
[133:32.92]But I got what I wanted.
[133:33.96]I don't even know what I picked up from that guy, but at least I don't have to worry about it anymore.
[133:42.73]Shotgun, best weapon.
[133:44.89]I always upgrade the shotguns to full.
[133:48.29]I think I looked over instead of reading chat for the next, you know what I mean?
[133:56.84]How do I do this?
[133:57.68]I can do it without... Okay.
[134:00.10]Can I pick it up after?
[134:02.38]Let's go.
[134:04.20]Look at the cheat map.
[134:17.99]Nope.
[134:18.59]Let's go.
[134:23.42]Really?
[134:23.64]Okay.
[134:30.01]Oh my god, dude.
[134:32.35]I can't play these games like that.
[134:34.15]If something's on the ground, I'm going to step in it every time.
[134:36.89]I will step in every single one of them.
[134:42.01]It's just, I just backtrack and run in circles and look around and try to find stuff.
[134:45.97]I just, I don't, it may as well not even be on the ground.
[134:53.58]Those of you that watched my Darkwood playthrough.
[134:56.80]People are like, oh, he's stepping on them on purpose.
[134:58.93]Go watch my Darkwood playthrough.
[135:01.79]I would love for you to go watch it.
[135:03.01]Because I stepped on almost every single one of them.
[135:07.47]My own traps that I put down.
[135:09.21]Alright, let's go the right way.
[135:15.12]That game was so horrible.
[135:17.18]I forgot how awful that game really was.
[135:22.61]It was so scary and so stressful.
[135:33.99]Not this time.
[135:45.37]I thought it came out of there and was a trap.
[136:02.12]Imagine getting imagine get being in the bathroom and having somebody kick you in the sternum to a point where your back Flies up against the wall next to you the force is so much That without even wiping your ass
[136:24.12]You get kicked in the chest and your back is planted against the wall.
[136:28.05]And your head.
[136:29.35]Up there.
[136:29.77]That would be such an awful way to go.
[136:32.89]Is there anything even in here?
[136:40.51]No.
[136:40.71]It's just scary.
[136:49.54]I remember this part.
[136:51.48]Not too shabby.
[136:54.82]Small key.
[136:57.76]I remember this part.
[136:58.58]Good.
[137:01.22]Wait.
[137:11.80]Any other treasures in here?
[137:21.15]Jesus.
[137:25.23]I have a lot of grenades.
[138:02.57]I give up.
[138:14.08]More photos.
[138:14.68]Can I spin it?
[138:19.63]There we go.
[138:22.27]At last, flesh of our flesh, blood of our blood, give thanks and rejoice.
[138:25.45]Okay.
[138:33.88]I think that's good.
[138:35.46]Now I have to be prepared because we go upstairs.
[138:43.97]That's not what that said.
[138:44.95]Alright, how do I feel about this?
[138:54.74]Let's do red and make these two.
[138:59.46]Do it again.
[139:06.49]Now we just need some yellow herbs, and we're good.
[139:25.46]Alright, good.
[139:30.22]I want to see a boss fight.
[139:31.83]Um...
[139:34.14]I don't want to spoil the game for you if you haven't seen it, but they are in the game.
[139:38.08]Okay.
[139:50.27]People have their most prized possessions.
[139:51.67]The farmer, his finest crop.
[139:54.47]Slight swineherd, stoutest pig.
[139:56.98]The beggarly grandam and her beloved babe.
[140:01.84]Crop, pig, babe.
[140:05.50]Now, where have I seen those before?
[140:06.68]Three things.
[140:13.37]Wait.
[140:14.61]Guys!
[140:36.71]Oh, that's not a pig.
[140:43.84]Crystal marble.
[140:45.14]Do you have any thoughts on Counter-Strike 2?
[140:52.53]Not really.
[140:52.95]I don't really like Counter-Strike at all.
[141:13.80]It feels like a new enemy type with the necks like this.
[141:16.64]I played CS:GO in like 2011.
[141:20.46]Yeah.
[141:23.04]It's been a long time though.
[141:29.16]Counter-Strike was always too hard for me.
[141:31.60]And I'm completely fine admitting that and accepting that.
[141:38.80]Counter-Strike just felt like it just took so much skill to play it.
[141:44.19]If you're good at it, good for you.
[142:57.12]It's actually kind of hard to control the mouse.
[143:02.09]Got it!
[143:25.28]Somebody can read that later.
[143:34.19]That's not, that's really not even a lot of lore either.
[143:36.17]I thought it was gonna be a lot.
[143:43.50]Key.
[144:06.19]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[144:20.08]I completely forgot that Ada was in this game.
[144:25.42]What do you mean spoiler?
[144:34.19]What?
[144:52.11]Those sunglasses are so bad.
[144:55.67]I mean, Capcom put it in.
[144:59.52]It was the remake.
[145:00.30]It was 81% accuracy.
[145:01.82]Find me another streamer that can do that.
[145:03.10]You know what I mean?
[145:07.14]Find me another live streamer on the internet that can get you an 81% first try.
[145:11.32]Moist had 90%.
[145:21.50]Moon Moon's on hardcore.
[145:22.50]Critical has 90.
[145:31.03]You are lame.
[145:32.15]You're so lame.
[145:40.69]Is that funny?
[145:46.88]Because there's so many people streaming this probably right now.
[145:51.41]There's a lot of really good players.
[145:53.60]Like, imagine actually making that statement.
[146:08.33]I don't want this rifle.
[146:09.21]You just did.
[146:09.71]I'm kidding.
[146:10.25]It was a joke.
[146:12.87]Don't make me put on the pay to win case.
[146:25.37]Whoa, wait, wait, wait, what are these?
[146:29.63]Equipped left, equipped center.
[146:33.19]I got these little toys?
[146:38.87]Wait.
[146:42.99]What did I just do?
[146:52.48]How do I take that off?
[146:57.63]charm perks plus 30 handgun ammo craft bonus frequency oh are you serious I've been waiting to do this stupid joke for like a week or two come on dude
[147:30.64]That's so annoying.
[147:31.36]That is so annoying.
[147:38.67]I haven't sneezed in like four, like probably five or six days because I just so badly want to just do this, but I'm not going to.
[147:45.16]Whatever.
[147:45.42]Alright.
[147:46.38]I mean, are these part of the... That's... Whatever.
[147:50.96]I'll keep them on.
[147:51.46]I don't care.
[148:00.89]How many chapters are in Resident Evil 4?
[148:02.29]Ten?
[148:04.61]Rooster Condor 1, I've got that intel you requested on Louis Serra.
[148:08.73]It seems he used to be a researcher for Umbrella.
[148:11.53]Umbrella?
[148:12.03]I should have left him in that bag to rot.
[148:16.62]I'm sending you the details.
[148:18.44]Take a look.
[148:19.36]But Baby Eagle is your priority.
[148:22.00]Copy that.
[148:23.54]Making my way to the church.
[148:25.33]Condor 1, out.
[148:49.53]Okay.
[148:52.01]Oh, I can't go up there.
[148:52.84]I need a right.
[148:53.82]Okay.
[148:54.62]I believe this gets a little wacky here.
[149:03.65]Somebody in chat, somebody says, can somebody in chat please help me?
[149:06.11]Why do I sneeze when I eat chocolate?
[149:08.19]Are you allergic to chocolate?
[149:10.77]That would be the first guess.
[149:13.23]Maybe you have a mild allergy to chocolate?
[149:14.97]I don't know.
[149:19.95]Be careful.
[149:20.39]Food allergies don't work like that.
[149:29.40]I'm not allergic to anything, so I don't know.
[149:45.90]It's a bathroom.
[149:46.78]Okay, wait.
[149:49.92]Don't I... I swear.
[149:56.74]Something happens here.
[149:57.88]Maybe not.
[149:58.92]Oh, I have the key.
[150:03.72]Come here, come here, come here.
[150:17.38]I got you.
[150:23.25]You alright?
[150:27.01]Take care of yourself, buddy.
[150:34.89]Good dog.
[150:37.69]Good dog.
[150:38.09]I can go that way.
[150:40.94]I can't open this yet, right?
[150:41.72]I think I can.
[150:47.14]But wait, is someone else back there?
[150:48.22]I want to see.
[150:53.16]No, this is the way I went before.
[151:00.05]Game progress.
[151:00.77]Okay.
[151:15.42]Okay.
[151:18.08]Creepy.
[151:26.14]Resources.
[151:32.47]Were there snakes?
[151:36.65]Missed a treasure.
[151:38.91]Eh, it's okay.
[151:40.91]I'll do it on the next playthrough.
[151:41.89]There's no way I'm not going to play... I'm going to play through this absolutely guaranteed at least another two or three times.
[151:46.83]Probably not on stream.
[151:48.71]I'll probably just do it in my own time or something at some point.
[151:54.97]Let's do the real treasure hunting.
[152:04.27]So far, this runs...
[152:07.59]perfectly I'd say it's perfect I haven't seen anything really bad so far I'll like slow down so there's been a little bit of a stutter like just a hint loading up some a new area but it's it's pretty smooth it's pretty solid at like 144 it feels like I have vsync on but it seems pretty good
[152:41.74]It'll stutter sometimes in the rain.
[152:45.30]I think that's alright.
[152:48.81]From what I remember, this Resident Evil 2 remake engine, whatever it is, was phenomenal.
[152:56.90]It was very, very good.
[152:57.94]It's probably one of the better engines I've played a game on.
[153:16.17]What the hell?
[153:20.56]I thought these were friends.
[153:21.48]I thought they were friends.
[153:25.55]Open.
[153:26.01]Oh god.
[153:59.35]Well, that's unfortunate.
[154:11.93]Where is it?
[154:18.47]On the stairs.
[154:19.35]Okay.
[154:19.85]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[154:20.67]I gotta do this.
[154:28.58]Lock up all these doors.
[154:29.61]Shit.
[154:39.36]I'm not healing yet.
[154:39.88]Can I close this door?
[154:44.61]No.
[155:23.16]Okay, this way.
[155:23.64]I think it's the other way.
[155:44.25]Yeah, it's the other way.
[155:51.98]I gotta go through that building, I think.
[155:54.78]Shit.
[155:58.57]Where are you?
[155:59.13]I think I have to go through that building and through the window.
[156:12.25]Yes, I do.
[156:23.84]Okay, we're good.
[156:34.61]Late stream.
[156:36.11]Yeah!
[156:45.16]Oh, shit.
[156:45.62]That's bad.
[156:49.31]So the game launched at 9 p.m.
[156:51.83]And I just could not wait another day.
[156:54.17]I want to play it.
[156:54.85]And that's what we're doing.
[157:10.10]Can't open these, right?
[157:16.45]Cool.
[157:19.45]Cool.
[157:21.49]Late stream is scary.
[157:24.79]Well, it makes the game a little scarier because it's dark.
[157:30.79]I actually like streaming with the camera on with the lights down because you can't see all like the weird tendencies of my face.
[157:36.55]I like it.
[157:39.77]So it's pog.
[157:47.65]Oh, I don't have... Let's go.
[158:12.84]I didn't even get tea.
[158:13.56]I need to get some tea.
[158:25.15]Snake!
[158:27.14]Did I get it?
[158:27.50]Oh, there we go.
[158:30.74]Viper.
[158:35.76]Medium-sized snake with a unique mottled pattern.
[158:38.83]If the poison glands are removed, it may be eaten.
[158:40.67]It can be used to restore health.
[158:43.83]Don't they sometimes drop really nice stuff?
[158:47.11]Because they run away quickly.
[158:48.61]If I remember that correctly.
[159:00.70]Load this up.
[159:02.78]I like the smokiness.
[159:03.56]That was creepy.
[159:27.73]They always do that.
[159:36.19]Illuminados49, sleep well and flourish, dear child.
[159:40.12]As your body grows, your mothers shall sew new small clothes.

[160:58.31]This is new.
[160:58.99]And that's not all.
[161:00.95]You're going to fix the bolts with attachable mines to quickly turn the weapon into a powerful mine thrower.

[161:37.54]So expensive.
[161:47.89]Discounted items?
[161:49.77]Discounts are only available during the chapters they appear in.
[161:55.41]Well, it really wants me to buy this bolt thrower.
[161:57.63]I feel like I have to buy this.
[162:06.94]I feel like this thing sucks though.

[162:37.25]Yeah, that's true.
[162:40.73]That's true.
[162:46.48]I'm not going to use this.
[162:53.10]So I'm going to sell it.
[162:53.80]I'm just not going to use it.
[162:54.71]I know I'm not.
[162:57.45]I'm just not going to use this either.
[162:59.41]I'm just certain of it.
[163:13.21]I guess I'll try it.

[163:52.91]If you want a fighting chance out there, you best tune up your kit.
[163:58.90]Try that on for size.
[164:04.59]Give that the care it deserves, mate.
[164:12.64]Let's go.

[179:14.63]I wanted to eat something.
[179:15.65]I was just like, you know what?
[179:17.65]I'm hungry.
[179:20.83]Holly was making tortillas.
[179:24.15]I could smell it.
[179:25.79]I was just like, you know.
[179:29.46]It was the pie on the windowsill.
[179:31.44]It was floating around.
[179:32.98]This late?
[179:39.04]Yeah.
[179:41.33]Sometimes it's what you want.
[179:48.59]That sounds like pretty good weed.
[179:54.23]No.
[179:56.25]That is not what...
[179:58.89]That's not what just happened.
[180:03.39]I told you guys before.
[180:06.35]I... I don't do that on stream.
[180:11.65]Not anymore.
[180:12.03]I didn't really do it that often anyways.
[180:17.49]But, no, I just can't.
[180:21.77]I physically would not be able to stream.
[180:24.92]Like, it's been pretty clear.
[180:36.82]After you couldn't read a clock.
[180:39.70]Yeah, but it was more than that, though.
[180:41.54]It was just... It's just my ability to even talk.
[180:49.74]Like, oh, I'm streaming right now.
[180:51.24]What are we going to talk about?
[180:53.17]It was just like, I can't even... What?
[180:56.65]I don't know.
[180:57.21]The streams were kind of like... I don't even know how to explain it, but you know what I mean.
[181:09.28]I thought they were funny.
[181:12.16]They can be fun and funny and everything, but I also don't want... I also don't want to have it be a thing that I'm just like, oh, look, look at how cool this is.
[181:22.52]It's funny.
[181:23.00]I'm high.
[181:23.60]Isn't that cool?
[181:24.30]Nah.
[181:28.63]It's funny to talk about.
[181:32.95]But obviously, I don't want it to be a staple of this channel.
[181:43.31]Anyways.
[181:43.65]I think I'm ready.
[181:56.72]No, you get it.
[181:57.32]I don't have to say anymore.
[181:58.38]Let's go.
[182:00.18]Hi.
[182:03.14]Alright.
[182:03.50]I'll make sure it's not too loud because of the music I had before.
[182:07.68]I think I'm good.
[182:12.97]Okay, that kind of scared the shit out of me.
[182:15.04]Alright, so, we good?
[182:18.50]Why am I, like, blue right now?
[182:19.82]Why?
[182:22.62]It wasn't like this before, was it?
[182:23.64]Alright, I got what I need.
[182:26.50]I got what I wanted.
[182:27.38]I got my new weapon.
[182:28.90]I have no idea how good it is.
[182:30.08]I have no idea how much damage it does.
[182:31.48]I have no idea if it's worth actually using.
[182:34.12]We're gonna use it.
[182:37.24]The game is saved.
[182:39.94]Let's go.
[182:45.25]I'm going to send you a strongly worded letter.
[182:48.47]Um, we'll just, just put it in here.
[182:51.84]I mean, you can, I think you only can do like 100, 200 characters or something, but just put it in here.
[183:01.22]Make minds.
[183:02.10]I'll have to buy the recipe.
[183:03.41]It's okay.
[183:04.17]I'll do it in a minute.
[183:04.89]Ooh.
[183:09.59]A church.
[183:10.67]I made it.
[183:13.82]How much longer are you going to be live for?
[183:16.62]That's a good question.
[183:17.40]I don't want to go too, too... I'm, like, doing fine.
[183:21.47]I'm very much awake.
[183:23.73]Very much awake.
[183:28.00]I don't want to go too, too late.
[183:45.99]I would say at least through the first boss.
[183:51.31]I think that makes sense to me.
[183:52.51]That's a good place to stop for tonight.
[183:56.19]I'm trying to think of the schedule for this weekend too.
[183:57.87]Because I either want to do like technically whatever would be tomorrow.
[184:02.94]Like tonight, tomorrow, and maybe Sunday.
[184:05.82]Or tonight and then Saturday, Sunday.
[184:09.28]Trying to think of how I should do it.
[184:16.51]Probably Saturday, Sunday.
[184:18.50]Gonna play Diablo 4?
[184:19.54]Nah.
[184:20.64]Nah.
[184:22.16]I think I got what I wanted out of it.
[184:26.02]It's definitely kind of not enough for me to understand if I really like it or not.
[184:30.20]It was fun, but I can see some cracks that I don't know if it's gonna be through all the whole release, through the end game of the content.
[184:40.75]I don't know.
[184:41.61]And I think I'd rather just wait.
[184:45.08]I'm just gonna wait.
[184:54.12]Dammit.
[184:58.44]Condor One to Roost.
[185:00.08]The church is sealed up.
[185:01.56]And Baby Eagle?
[185:02.96]Negative.
[185:03.80]Nothing yet.
[185:05.12]But they sure do have this place locked up tight.
[185:08.24]I see.
[185:08.60]I can think of one reason they'd want to do so.
[185:12.04]Oh, she's here.
[185:13.28]That's for sure.
[185:14.84]I'll find a way in.
[185:16.28]Condor One, out.
[185:19.28]But also, I mean, I don't even know if I'm gonna play D4.
[185:22.66]I think the reason why I wanted to play Diablo 4 was just because everything I heard leading up to it was, hey, Diablo II.
[185:31.57]Remember that game?
[185:34.69]We remember that game.
[185:37.01]I think that's why I was thinking about playing it.
[185:41.93]But, eh.
[185:43.41]We'll see.
[185:44.19]If I play it, I play it.
[185:44.91]If I don't, I don't.
[185:45.53]I don't have, like, really a plan to
[185:49.62]But, yeah.
[185:50.40]We'll see.
[185:56.40]We don't talk about Diablo 3.
[185:59.12]Diablo 3 was alright.
[186:00.60]It was fine.
[186:01.34]I mean... As much as I just wish it was a different game, it was the game that it was.
[186:08.53]And I played a lot of it.
[186:10.57]I got a lot out of that game.
[186:12.09]I did.
[186:16.02]Those traitorous twins should not be allowed to rest in peace for joining that evil cult.
[186:21.02]Someone, anyone destroy the emblems engraved upon their tombstones?
[186:25.61]Destroy the tombstone emblems.
[186:28.35]Oh, that's easy.
[186:28.89]I can do that right now.
[186:43.76]Is it back here?
[186:53.41]Also, I said this earlier, I think, before playing D4.
[186:56.51]I think Blizzard's in kind of a weird spot right now.
[187:01.04]Where they really kind of... They need to have something, right?
[187:06.54]They have to kind of... I feel like I haven't really cared about a Blizzard game in a long time.
[187:12.54]Like, the last... The last, I want to say, five years have been... They've been pretty fucked up.
[187:20.01]So... I don't know.
[187:27.05]Is this it?
[187:27.27]Does that count?
[187:32.25]Does it want me to destroy?
[187:43.38]Is it the twins or something, right?
[187:48.00]Is it these ones?
[187:48.60]Can I look at that note?
[187:51.34]Where is it?
[187:54.83]Those Raiders twins should not be allowed to rest in peace for joining that evil cult.
[187:58.05]I think it's these two.
[187:58.67]Okay, cool.
[188:26.69]let me in here lakeside map test bro he outside his home for the irl locker and
[188:43.07]church and wait orders from your lord until then keep the church door shut if you'll be held in the cave on the other side of the you didn't really hide this that well the monster will deal with the it's this didn't take that long to crack didn't you just tell us that you weren't high
[189:18.27]Yeah, I'm making a- I'm making a point that this is not that well- Somebody was trying to hide this text.
[189:22.88]They didn't do a very good job.
[189:29.58]This is a YouTube poop transcript.
[189:39.49]Lake.
[189:40.95]Let's hope for no more surprises.
[189:47.95]I want to shoot somebody with this thing, but... Watch me not even shoot one person the whole game with that weapon.
[189:57.75]It's probably going to happen.
[189:59.43]I would not be surprised.
[190:00.59]Ooh.
[190:08.84]Ooh.
[190:14.82]Yellow diamond.
[190:15.96]I needed that one.
[190:17.98]It's a good one.
[190:33.91]Was there anything else out here?
[190:34.81]Let me just check.
[190:38.41]Down here or something.
[190:39.37]I feel like... Let me take a look at my cheating map.
[190:42.43]There is!
[190:43.13]Look at that!
[190:53.29]Where is it?
[191:03.38]Oh, it's right there.
[191:04.22]Hell yeah.
[191:16.82]How can you play so late at night and not be scared?
[191:18.86]I don't know if you were here an hour ago, but I was.
[191:26.48]It got me a few times.
[191:28.46]At least.
[191:37.17]My camera seems to have auto-adjusted, though, because now it's kind of weirdly lit in here.
[191:49.76]Did I miss him something?
[192:14.41]Did I already get the emblem?
[192:16.21]No, I didn't.
[192:33.16]webcam is like three pixels what happened to the one you had in November I have only increased the payments for webcams over the last six months I started with a c920 and I used it for years I then bought a logitech brio which was way more expensive than the c920
[192:56.88]And then I bought the Razer one, which was, I believe, even more expensive than the Brio.
[193:05.62]So I just keep adding, I just keep throwing money at this problem.
[193:09.88]And it doesn't seem to be fixing it.
[193:16.68]This like corporate Andy over here.
[193:19.30]Is there a problem?
[193:20.56]Here, here, just, I don't know, just take that and make it better.
[193:24.42]Take that and make it a little better for me.
[193:27.33]It didn't work?
[193:27.93]Well, whatever.
[193:28.39]I don't know.
[193:28.91]Just take more of it.
[193:33.11]Wait, I'm supposed to be looking.
[193:36.39]My immersion.
[193:39.45]I think this one looks fine.
[193:40.39]I think this one looks the best out of the three of them.
[193:48.60]It's also really dark in here.
[193:49.70]Come on, we've got to be fair.
[194:16.03]What?
[194:19.40]I didn't know that's what that was.
[194:23.34]Beautiful lighting effect.
[194:45.63]Come on down here.
[194:46.45]Oh, that's a lot of you.
[194:47.99]Hold on, hold on.
[194:50.11]Wait till they jump down before you walk over here.
[195:10.48]Very nice.
[195:18.56]Somebody behind me.
[195:31.39]More fun to play in the dark?
[195:34.39]I actually really don't like... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[195:37.41]I actually don't really like bright-ass lights.
[195:47.61]really lit up, really bright rooms, and I hate it.
[195:51.67]It kind of hurts my head.
[195:54.98]This room has light in it.
[195:57.04]It's a little lit up, but I much prefer slightly dim.
[196:04.98]No, it's not dark, dark in here, but it is dim.
[196:08.86]I prefer it that way.
[196:14.67]I would wear sunglasses all the time.
[196:17.07]I would be this.
[196:18.41]I would do that.
[196:21.11]I feel like having a little bit of tint darker makes me feel better.
[196:37.80]What is going on here?
[196:40.10]What is going on?
[196:42.08]Where are these people?
[197:08.27]Stop throwing these!
[197:09.67]How did I light on fire?
[197:10.89]Alright, we gotta go.
[197:31.48]This guy is so bad.
[197:32.66]Jesus.
[197:47.41]One down, more like 10.
[197:48.33]That guy got in my head because I missed three shots.
[198:15.98]I gotta hold.
[198:18.49]Didn't I get a yellow herb?
[198:23.63]Bolts.
[198:27.62]Bolts for the bolt thrower.
[198:28.72]I wonder if that was stupid.
[198:46.70]Why are you so red?
[198:47.72]Because I have a lot of blood.
[198:52.11]I'm gonna try it.
[199:13.28]You can retrieve the ammo, which is good, yeah.
[199:17.48]What does it even look like?
[199:18.36]I'm going to shoot it.
[199:19.14]Okay, that's pretty cool.
[199:24.91]Can I pick him up indefinitely?
[199:25.99]I'll just reload on it.
[199:32.19]I'm really long.
[199:36.92]Very long.
[199:39.50]Let's check it out.
[200:01.15]Ooh.
[200:03.83]That's a good grab.
[200:07.01]Why do I have so much blood?
[200:19.60]My circulation is very good.
[200:20.66]I have very good circulation.
[200:21.70]Except my hands get cold.
[200:28.57]Alright, this is Blue Medallions, and we can actually cheat.
[200:37.27]I had bought the Deluxe Edition.
[200:42.78]Uh, okay, actually, I should probably heal, but, eh, let's just go for it.
[200:47.88]You guys ready?
[200:48.48]Uh, this is one of the coolest parts of the game, if you guys don't know.
[200:52.79]So, in here, see all these crows?
[200:55.03]A huge Raven boss flies down here.
[200:57.95]and picks you up by the back that's why there's all these birds and and you have to fight the bird while you're flying around um it's unbelievable it was really really cool in the regular game I'm just really curious how they do it in this one because like you actually have to fight and shoot the bird while it's like it's like clawing your back and stuff and it like swings around you go past the church and past buildings this whole aerial fight
[201:28.68]Can I take the bolts out?
[201:40.94]Yep.
[201:50.11]This thing's actually kind of good.
[201:51.31]This is actually pretty good.
[202:24.19]Alright, here we go.
[202:54.05]It was the bird.
[202:54.55]In a minute.
[202:56.38]I had it wrong.
[203:32.79]I can't believe they cut the iconic bird fight.
[203:40.16]I don't think they did.
[203:40.84]No.
[203:42.42]Sell them.
[203:42.74]Get all the expenses you put back into it.
[203:44.42]Mm-hmm.
[204:10.22]What a good ring.
[204:12.50]You just get rid of these.
[204:14.06]We're selling only.
[204:15.80]That's good.
[204:19.52]Take these two vipers.
[204:41.82]I have one more Viper.
[204:50.06]I still use all this stuff.
[204:52.00]He's a Punisher.
[204:52.82]I think I'm going to buy with this.
[204:55.16]Right?
[204:56.92]This is probably not a bad idea.
[205:12.81]I don't think it's a bad idea.
[205:13.65]I'm going to get it.
[205:19.46]You can't go wrong with that.
[205:22.32]Alright, bolt thrower.
[205:23.90]Probably maybe ammo capacity.
[205:26.60]Your weapons are in good hands, mate.
[205:29.80]I'll see you right.
[205:30.86]I'll just make this thing deadly.
[205:37.78]Yeah, this thing is filthy now.
[205:38.70]We're starting to get an idea of your tastes, friend.
[205:43.62]1.8.
[205:43.64]This thing is filthy.
[205:54.02]Alright, one more Viper and I get that.
[205:56.62]Okay.
[205:56.98]Let's make this.
[205:57.66]I have a 2, don't I?
[205:58.17]Okay, here we go.
[206:14.06]Wait a minute.
[206:14.72]Hold on.
[206:14.98]Wait, wait, wait.
[206:22.36]How come I can't put that... It wants me to use two of these, but I already have one.
[206:35.23]Don't I already... Is this going to take two and make another one?
[206:37.79]Don't I already have one?
[206:42.09]Last option.
[206:46.24]Yeah, that's the right one.
[206:48.93]Yeah.
[206:49.91]I was going to try to put it in this one, but I forgot I had these two.
[206:53.79]I forgot I had these two red and greens, so that's good.
[206:56.11]Alright, so this is a... I'm probably just going to take this now.
[207:01.57]It's a full heal now.
[207:03.32]Wait until you really need it.
[207:04.12]Alright, let's do it.
[207:12.92]I'm going to be using this, actually, because it's the best thing I have right now.
[207:16.74]What is that?
[207:21.50]Hexagon piece A. Cool.
[207:35.66]There's more to do down there.
[207:44.57]You need to go get the treasures.
[207:50.20]Yeah, I wasn't going to leave yet.
[207:51.06]There's like an elevator here and everything.
[207:54.08]Hold on.
[207:59.72]I kind of sprinted down here.
[208:01.24]There is something else here.
[208:02.12]Yeah, right here.
[208:08.82]Can't do this.
[208:12.68]I can see that, but people are going to make fun of me, so whatever.
[208:21.12]Where is it?
[208:28.25]Up there.
[208:40.73]Spilled sauce on my Grotto Beasts shirt?
[208:44.92]Oh, no.
[208:45.46]Let's put some, uh...
[208:50.71]Get some, get some, get some, um... What do they use?
[208:55.72]Get some, um, get some OxiClean or something.
[208:57.58]I don't know.
[209:03.86]Club Soda.
[209:04.38]Yeah, Club Soda.
[209:04.90]Where does this go?
[209:11.23]I don't even know where this goes.
[209:22.37]Is this new?
[209:24.23]Is this a mini game?
[209:26.31]Wow, look at this food.
[209:29.81]Oh.
[209:29.97]We can earn some stuff here.
[209:33.15]Okay.
[209:49.50]What is this?
[209:51.04]Token machines?
[209:57.70]Three silver or gold tokens at the token machine to win a random charm.
[210:01.52]The more gold tokens you use, the greater your chance of getting a rare charm.
[210:05.02]I don't have any tokens though.
[210:09.80]Where do you get tokens?
[210:14.05]Shut up!
[210:21.46]Destroy the pirates and shoot for the high score.
[210:23.36]Weapons and ammo are unlimited and it's all free.
[210:25.92]Earn tokens based on your score.
[210:27.91]This is the page turning sound in 3D Movie Maker.
[210:39.03]It's from 3D Movie Maker for Windows 95.
[210:42.83]Okay, um... You can destroy several targets at once by shooting at nearby dynamite instead of explosions.
[210:49.44]Be careful, shooting a sailor will deduct points.
[210:52.90]Some targets cannot be destroyed with one shot.
[210:54.82]Shoot as many shots as it takes until they break.
[210:57.42]If certain conditions are met, bonus targets will be added.
[211:00.17]However, these conditions will change from game to game.
[211:03.01]This seems kind of fun.
[211:08.29]Well, I need to earn some tokens.
[211:13.07]Unlimited ammo My whole face is itchy
[211:56.73]Bad.
[211:58.29]Very bad.
[211:58.87]I can do better than that.
[212:15.68]You can tell my sensitivity is too low because of that.
[212:22.04]My sensitivity is too low.
[212:23.86]You can tell because I couldn't track it.
[212:26.23]Sensitivity's too low.
[212:29.59]Now I understand why he doesn't play PvP games.
[212:31.28]Hey, 35+.
[212:31.78]That's pretty good for 35+.
[213:16.11]My fucking hands, my fingers hurt.
[213:23.90]Fucking hand hurts.
[213:29.43]I kind of, might have made the room red.
[213:32.33]Why did the room get red?
[213:35.67]Wasn't it just blue?
[213:56.51]Why am I trying to shoot them in the head?
[213:58.12]I don't have to.

[215:11.91]How do I restart again?
[215:12.93]I got a really bad score.
[215:41.99]This one doesn't even count.
[215:43.01]Just do it.
[215:43.55]I want to do it again.
[215:48.13]I can't leave.
[215:48.79]It's a very generous C.
[216:23.29]Stop moving, hands are shaking around.
[216:55.96]Alright, I can do it again.
[217:21.73]I can do much better than that.
[217:23.67]I can do so much better than that.
[217:30.30]I can do better than that
[218:11.04]What?
[218:15.36]This wasn't even reloaded.
[218:16.54]I need to switch between the weapons.
[219:09.01]Take the other ground!
[220:09.39]I almost 100%ed it.
[220:11.41]Oh shit, we got a big raid.
[220:15.29]That's from CDawg.
[220:17.09]What's up, CDawg?
[220:20.37]Holy shit, that's a big one.
[220:21.88]That is a large raid.
[220:25.72]You wasted time switching weapons?

[220:56.96]That's awesome.
[220:57.60]Holy shit.
[220:58.12]That's a lot of money.
[220:59.90]Well, going to a good cause.
[221:01.14]That's great.
[221:02.64]Welcome.
[221:03.88]Thanks for the raid.
[221:04.46]We're playing Resident Evil 4.
[221:06.58]I can tell you, not for much longer.
[221:09.42]So, I don't know how much longer we're going to do this for, but I'm about to open up a bunch of fun boxes.
[221:15.75]You guys ready?
[221:17.65]Ready?
[221:19.51]End of the stream voice?
[221:20.31]No, no, no, no, not yet.
[221:21.31]I just want to... Raiders that came in, we want to make sure we have a clear indication of what's going to happen here.
[221:26.21]Alright.
[221:29.53]I got three coins.
[221:34.15]So should I do three?
[221:39.29]Just go all in with three.
[221:48.47]What is it?
[221:52.53]Charms.
[221:53.11]Charms can be swapped out via the customized case menu.
[221:57.09]Dr. Salvador.
[221:59.21]20% rifle ammo craft bonus.
[222:00.61]Well, that sucks.
[222:02.89]Why did I get a common?
[222:04.11]I just put three gold coins in there.
[222:18.13]Magnum ammo crafting.
[222:26.91]These are all commons.
[222:29.81]I'm going to put that one on.
[222:38.63]Rare.
[222:42.90]That's a couple of magnum.
[222:44.86]How do I get more coins?
[222:47.78]I want more coins.
[222:48.42]How do I get them?
[222:50.44]Alright.
[222:56.18]I gotta 100% the whole game.
[222:58.28]I have to 100% everything.
[222:59.76]I have to get all the skulls.
[223:09.43]How do I just turn it off?
[223:10.42]Turn it off.
[223:10.80]Just turn it off.
[223:11.22]Turn the game off.
[223:11.84]How do I turn the game off?
[223:12.60]Just turn the game off.
[223:14.32]I fucked it up already.
[223:43.91]I can't just exit.
[223:56.65]Quit the mission?
[223:57.29]I don't think I can.
[224:03.14]Can I escape?
[224:04.48]Oh, quit shooting.
[224:05.64]Oh, come on, come on, come on.
[224:11.00]Let's go, go, go, go, go.
[224:48.51]Whoa, what a miss, wow, what a mistake.
[224:52.25]Wow, what just happened there?
[224:53.55]Oh my God, what just happened?
[224:55.27]I fucking crumbled like a piece of paper.
[225:55.56]Where are the, where's the, where, where, where, where, where, where, where?
[225:57.66]That's so, how do you hit that?
[226:11.56]How do you hit that?
[226:12.36]It's so hard.
[226:50.89]WHAT?! !
[228:09.56]I have to do it.
[228:10.70]I can't leave.
[228:16.31]Fuck, my eyes are bulging out of my head.
[228:18.47]Okay, we're good.
[228:21.16]Relax, relax, relax.
[228:22.98]I gotta...
[229:13.63]You're killing me!
[229:20.13]Oh my god, why did it do that?
[229:23.52]Why did it go... What was that?
[229:26.08]What the hell was that?
[229:30.30]Why did it go like... I didn't do it.
[229:32.64]I held the button down.
[229:33.44]What was that for?
[229:34.76]Because you moved?
[229:35.61]What?
[229:36.87]What do you mean I moved?
[229:39.39]Look.
[229:41.59]Look.
[229:41.69]Look.
[229:43.26]what see look throw a grenade over there I can't I would
[230:51.36]I didn't get it.
[230:52.84]I hit the thing behind it.
[230:54.34]I don't know how but that's what happened.
[230:59.72]I missed it.
[231:00.65]How did I miss it?
[231:03.75]Come on.
[231:21.07]All this to gamble on that fucking machine.
[231:54.19]I can't do it.
[231:55.59]I can't do it guys.
[231:57.41]I can't do it.
[231:59.71]I can't do it.
[232:02.53]I can't do it.
[232:03.40]I can't do it.
[232:12.18]Just stay in one place.
[232:13.36]I know but I have to.
[232:14.02]I gotta know where it is.
[233:16.58]That was hard.
[233:18.20]Stop moving around.
[233:21.18]Get outta the way!
[233:46.63]How many more are there, two?
[234:03.28]There are 10.
[234:14.01]What the footies, what?
[234:15.37]What happened?
[234:17.46]What?
[234:18.68]What was wrong with that?
[235:13.58]Did I miss one?
[235:16.08]Does it come back?
[235:24.69]Did I get it?
[235:29.23]It doesn't come back.
[235:32.11]Damn it.
[235:32.97]Okay.
[235:36.00]I got everything, but come on.
[235:40.16]So that one that flies across the beginning, I got to be ready for it.
[235:46.42]This shit's so bizarre.
[236:21.54]Hurry up, hurry up.
[236:24.18]Oh, just reload again.
[236:26.81]Fuck.
[236:44.27]Shit.
[236:44.71]I got him, though.
[236:45.19]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[236:47.01]I got it, I got it.
[236:48.11]I got it.
[236:49.81]Almost got 100%.
[236:56.05]Okay, this one's gonna be a lot harder and I'm gonna do something weird.
[237:01.79]Does he have one on him?
[237:23.98]We haven't seen one yet.
[237:24.78]I just want to see where they are.
[237:28.82]Nobody has one on them.
[237:30.57]Nobody.
[237:31.39]Not yet.
[237:31.79]This whole time.
[237:34.61]No one's had one the whole time.
[237:35.51]There's one.
[237:56.01]Someone just won.
[238:00.25]I don't even care.
[238:00.78]It's not what I'm doing here.
[238:10.74]Holy shit.
[238:15.45]Oh, I ruined everything.
[238:28.22]I got them all, didn't I?
[238:35.96]I got them all.
[238:42.59]What did I miss?
[238:45.45]Spinning ones sometimes have a skull on the single side.
[238:48.05]In the back, you mean?
[238:49.23]Okay, so I'm... Alright.
[239:04.44]That was a very bad display.
[239:35.63]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[240:17.74]Are we good?
[240:18.14]Are we good?
[240:23.84]Are we good?
[240:31.05]I don't know.
[240:31.71]Five out of seven again?
[240:33.81]Where the fuck are the other two?
[240:36.97]Where are the other two?
[240:38.31]The first spinning sword pirate has one.
[240:42.26]First spinning... The first spinning pirate between the two sailors has one in his chest.
[240:46.65]But only on one side it shows.
[240:48.27]First spinning one at the beginning.
[240:51.37]It's hidden behind the person with the barrel.
[240:54.70]What?
[240:55.16]Okay.
[240:59.72]Let me just see where they are.
[241:00.50]Really, that's... How many times did you shoot?
[241:20.96]Okay.
[241:21.46]Alright, now I know where they are.
[241:25.55]We're good.
[241:48.32]So those are the two that I was missing.
[241:51.07]Don't fuck it up.
[241:52.65]I said don't fuck it up.
[242:28.99]Reload it quick!
[242:38.73]That's it.
[242:39.03]I got it.
[242:39.31]I got it.
[242:39.49]I got them all.
[242:41.86]Right?
[242:42.02]I got them all.
[242:42.40]Got them all.
[242:58.20]Yes.
[242:58.74]Okay.
[242:59.61]Let's go.
[243:00.71]Let's go.
[243:01.99]Give me more.
[243:03.05]I await your return.
[243:31.39]Plus 30% attachable mines craft.
[243:33.73]I mean, that's okay for what I use.
[243:36.47]I wouldn't say that's worth three golden coins.
[243:45.76]Are there even any other rarities in the game?
[243:56.89]Well, I can't get many... I can't get any more gold coins from this.
[244:01.10]There's probably more later.
[244:03.04]I need to go into my inventory.
[244:05.96]That was really fun though.
[244:07.28]That's cool.
[244:21.20]Mix the coins up next time.
[244:22.32]Well, three, but I mean three gold coins.
[244:25.90]That should give you something.
[244:27.02]I am bright.
[244:27.80]I can look over and see in the OBS preview.
[244:30.94]I am red.
[244:33.51]What happened?
[244:39.47]Well, that blood came up to my face.
[244:40.77]Okay, so customize case.
[244:51.06]I should probably put this one on then, right?
[244:52.90]This is, you get more, do I want more handgun ammo or more money?
[245:03.25]Probably money.
[245:06.47]Are we done for today?
[245:07.53]Not yet.
[245:07.81]I mean, I feel like that's pretty good.
[245:23.35]Do they stack?
[245:27.14]They don't.
[245:31.92]I craft shotgun shells all the time.
[245:39.68]Yeah, this is a cool idea.
[245:40.44]I like it.
[245:41.04]This is a cool addition.
[245:44.33]Speaking of crafting.
[245:45.65]Let's go ahead and do that now.
[246:03.48]I need gunpowder.
[246:04.22]Okay, let's keep going.
[246:17.77]I don't really have any money.
[246:18.47]I did what I wanted to do, and let's continue.
[246:29.92]Okay, um...
[246:36.83]should heal with the herb um I will eventually so the I have a question the the bird boss right how come the bird boss didn't activate you know why did the bird boss not activate right you know what I mean
[247:04.22]It's different.
[247:05.34]Okay.
[247:05.84]You're good.
[247:06.12]You're good.
[247:06.42]Okay.
[247:08.80]On the way back.
[247:09.66]Okay.
[247:27.07]This is really, really great so far.
[247:28.81]It's really good.
[247:29.39]Shit.
[247:40.27]I mean, this game is just phenomenal on regardless of what version it is.
[247:46.13]But it does feel pretty great to come back to this.
[247:50.88]We talked about how I wish I could like wipe my memory and play all the FromSoftware games again.
[247:55.64]This kind of feels like that.
[248:00.07]So this is really cool.
[248:01.41]Really enjoying it so far.
[248:09.15]Can I do anything here?
[248:15.35]Hey, is that the right dock?
[248:17.39]I don't think so.
[248:25.62]There you are.
[248:26.10]I can't do anything else here.
[248:39.92]I think I just have to leave.
[248:42.73]OK, goodbye.
[248:52.35]And then we go out to the right.
[248:53.93]So wait.
[249:05.86]No, it's wait, where am I going?
[249:12.89]Why are you up so late?
[249:18.73]Because the game released late and I wanted to jump in on it, at least on the launch day, because I was very excited for this and it's really, really cool.
[249:28.08]And I'm glad I did because it's been really fun.
[249:49.06]I'm going to continue playing this.
[249:50.84]This is pretty much what I'm going to be doing all weekend.
[249:52.42]So yeah, I'm going to finish it this weekend.
[250:00.85]Whoa.
[250:34.36]There was a raid from Prezzo earlier, too.
[250:36.14]Thanks, Prezzo.
[250:36.66]Appreciate it.
[250:37.99]I don't know if you're still here or if anybody's still here.
[250:42.51]I miss raids.
[250:44.71]It's actually a problem.
[250:48.78]I promise I'm not ungrateful.
[250:51.30]I'm just scattered.
[250:54.60]Shoot the water.
[250:55.18]Shoot the water.
[250:55.70]I appreciate it, though.
[250:56.85]Thank you.
[251:01.31]Shoot the water.
[251:01.91]Shoot the water.
[251:02.51]Hurry up!
[251:03.87]The boat fuel is stored with the generator fuel inside the processing building at the fish farm.
[251:07.71]Take only what you need.
[251:08.81]Let's collect all this.
[251:24.63]I bet there's a snake in here.
[251:33.21]No.
[251:34.41]Thousand bucks, though.
[251:35.05]That's a lot.
[251:42.33]Got a lot of ammo.
[251:42.97]That's good.
[251:44.45]Shoot the water.
[251:45.15]Shoot the water.
[251:45.83]Shoot the water.
[251:46.85]Yeah, I will in a minute.
[251:58.03]Fuel.
[251:58.51]Come on.
[251:59.49]Fill the tank when you're done.
[252:29.41]Hey, it happened.
[252:30.35]I did it.
[252:30.65]How the hell am I gonna go back down and do that?
[252:38.63]Oh, I gotta pick up all this shit.
[252:45.30]Dammit.
[252:45.86]Okay, hold on.
[252:52.81]Can you do it again?
[252:53.49]I missed it.
[252:54.65]I have a really cool trick that you are going to learn right now.
[252:57.89]If you miss something during the stream, then I am red.
[253:02.44]Like, this has to change now.
[253:04.12]Like, this is ridiculous.
[253:14.73]Why is it... My room is red right now.
[253:17.79]It's not me, I swear.
[253:18.83]I swear.
[253:23.80]It's like the color correction on the camera.
[253:35.06]See what I mean?
[253:35.54]Look.
[253:35.74]Look what just happened.
[253:38.07]This is what it actually looks like in here.
[253:41.29]Looks like... I still am red.
[253:47.25]I'm a red... I'm a... Whatever.
[253:49.77]It's too late to get annoyed by this.
[254:07.40]That's better.
[254:07.80]That's fine.
[254:08.84]That's fine.
[254:09.36]You need to put the hero filter on to match this.
[254:20.53]I don't even care.
[254:21.19]There's so much blood swirling around in here.
[254:27.99]I told you guys that people are like, wow, how can you stay so thin?
[254:34.11]How do you stay like that?
[254:35.07]You must exercise.
[254:36.93]Guys, I burn so many calories just by existing.
[254:40.05]I swear to you.
[254:43.13]My body is just constantly just a revved up machine.
[254:47.73]I have these dreams that are real life up here.
[254:50.77]I burn more calories in my dreams than I do when I'm awake.
[254:56.88]I'm constantly... My body is constantly just producing energy.
[255:03.16]If you, like, put two little wires on me, I could probably power a fucking clock.
[255:08.61]Like a potato.
[255:20.07]He's flexing on all us normal people.
[255:22.79]That's...
[255:27.16]That did sound a little braggy.
[255:29.02]That sounded a little braggy, but that's not what I meant by that.
[255:33.44]That was a little braggy.
[255:35.16]Okay.
[255:35.94]I admit.
[255:36.80]But that's not what I mean.
[255:37.62]Alright, back to it.
[255:47.87]I got everything, right?
[255:54.43]Jeez, Jerma, I wish I had superpowers too.
[255:59.89]Shit.
[256:31.61]Hey, can you shoot the water?
[256:33.23]Nah.
[256:36.58]Nah, I'm good.
[256:38.46]Shooting the water might be kind of funny though.
[257:05.59]That was not in there before, was it?
[257:06.89]Interesting.
[257:08.35]Okay.
[257:13.40]This stuff is in different places now.
[257:15.58]What is in here?
[257:18.52]It's random.
[257:23.08]Wait, it's not placed individually?
[257:25.78]It's random.
[257:27.09]I didn't know it was random.
[257:32.09]I thought there was actually a place there.
[257:35.02]Should we be out of here?
[257:43.52]Most Resident Evil games were that way.
[257:44.76]I don't remember them being random.
[257:47.04]I guess certain key placement is... Certain items are there, not random.
[257:53.64]Need two more of those.
[258:03.21]Nice.
[258:08.60]Well, I'm about to craft one of these anyways, so let's go.
[258:23.84]I'm going to blow through these, I think, at some point here.
[258:26.38]Not enough gunpowder.
[258:32.93]Reroll the loot.
[258:33.67]Shoot the water.
[258:34.21]That was pretty good loot.
[258:35.75]I don't want to reroll it.
[258:38.39]Alright, back to... Did I get everything?
[258:42.37]Oh, wait a minute.
[258:43.03]This is what 10 extra dollars buys you.
[258:49.38]Where is it?
[259:04.34]Under the dock.
[259:09.95]Yes it is.
[259:19.58]Please turn the Thanos filter off.
[259:41.64]Make yourself green.
[259:57.27]There's the last one.
[260:04.79]Oh, come on.
[260:08.36]I'm just going to take one of these.
[260:15.80]I needed it anyways.
[260:16.52]Shit.
[260:21.92]Oh my god.
[260:23.11]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[260:32.67]Oh my goodness.
[260:34.44]Oh my goodness, run.
[260:35.28]I got him.
[260:43.53]Where's my, where's my bolt?
[260:45.01]Where's my bolt?
[260:49.52]Oh, get off me.
[260:50.38]This gun is fucking stupid.
[261:52.18]It's not that bad.
[261:56.18]I did lose one of my bolts, though.
[261:58.55]I don't know why.
[261:59.71]Is it in the water somewhere?
[262:02.57]Eh, whatever.
[262:03.31]It's fine.
[262:21.75]Right, right, right.
[262:24.48]I didn't do it right, but I tried.
[262:26.88]It's too late to do that, dude.
[262:28.22]Stop.
[263:07.68]There's so much more money and shit down here.
[263:10.26]Yeah, keep going.
[263:12.08]Wait, what's back here?
[263:12.84]That's where I came from, right?
[263:16.59]Yeah, I don't want to come back here.
[263:26.88]You're going to blow up like the guy from Big Trouble in Little China.
[263:41.48]Why do I... Why do I know what that is?
[263:47.28]Do I know what that is?
[263:48.12]It's a classic movie.
[264:09.50]One more.
[264:20.62]Swing!
[264:28.65]What the hell?
[264:36.39]Uh-oh!
[264:46.25]Whoa!
[264:46.95]They're behind me!
[264:48.34]Oh!
[264:50.79]Somebody swung at me.
[264:51.53]Where'd they go?
[264:53.01]Did you see the axe when I... What?
[264:54.61]That was weird.
[264:55.41]There you go!
[265:04.48]That's it!
[265:22.78]Sit down.
[265:24.66]Uh-oh.
[265:33.42]Okay.
[265:41.81]I need to... There we go.
[265:46.61]Good.
[265:48.85]That should free up some space.
[265:50.59]It didn't free up any space.
[265:56.94]I need to craft some shit.
[265:58.70]Uh, alright.
[265:59.24]I'm gonna go two... Two green herbs.
[266:07.21]That should free up some space.
[266:11.05]You look like a very tired John Wick.
[266:26.16]Yeah.
[266:27.67]I'm thinking I'm back.
[266:40.98]What you told me I'm gonna say something if you say it like you don't you can't minus do that many times you crash my computer.
[266:49.58]Don't do that.
[266:50.18]You can crash my computer if you do that stop.
[267:09.59]I hear beeps.
[267:11.85]Oh my god.
[267:12.71]Thank goodness I didn't do that.
[267:13.91]If you say that was funny and then you write -2, it is automatically not counted.
[267:27.54]I just want to make sure you understand that.
[267:31.17]The algorithm picks up if you said, like how L, mega lul, -2, and that does not count.
[267:36.31]You negate it.
[267:51.47]I understand the appeal of this thing, and I'm starting to get why it's kind of cool.
[267:54.93]Because it's effectively infinite ammo if you're good at shooting.
[267:59.88]Which I don't know how good I am at that.
[268:02.12]Where is this bee?
[268:03.88]Here.
[268:18.33]It's good for stealth.
[268:22.68]Oh, there's one more of those.
[268:23.66]Where is it?
[268:24.12]Where's this medallion?
[268:32.03]I think it's probably on the outside.
[268:34.17]Ooh, chest.
[268:37.90]I can't carry any more of these.
[268:39.30]I'm just going to eat one of them.
[268:51.77]Where's that medallion?
[268:53.97]There it is.
[268:59.29]Last one.
[269:01.69]Need one more.
[269:05.67]There's a lot of these.
[269:21.79]I can't take anymore.
[269:39.56]Egg.
[269:39.80]Boat fuel.
[269:42.96]Go back to the boat.
[269:59.14]Who just puts an egg in their pocket?
[270:02.20]This is a little weird, but is it really?
[270:03.64]Stays fresh.
[270:06.86]As long as you don't break it.
[270:07.90]I'm going to leave that there in case I need to eat it later.
[270:25.14]You look like you want revenge today.
[270:42.55]Oh my God, be careful.
[270:47.36]But I just tripped it.
[270:50.02]Oops.
[270:51.66]A lot of money.
[270:53.82]Alright, back to the boat.
[271:16.94]This is for dead.
[271:48.72]I wonder how much harder hardcore is.
[271:51.64]Because the parry makes hardcore, I think, not as bad.
[272:04.05]It's a lot harder.
[272:05.63]Oh.
[272:06.07]Well.
[272:07.37]I think with a parry, that wouldn't be too awful.
[272:10.65]As long as you did the parry right.
[272:11.77]Okay, I gotta go back up this way.
[272:19.16]It's too hard.
[272:19.70]You're a baby.
[272:29.19]You know about me anyways.
[272:32.55]What do you know about me?
[272:34.35]What do you know about me?
[272:37.09]Hmm?
[272:41.89]Too much, somebody said.
[272:52.57]I want to save the game.
[272:53.75]Because I'm a little concerned that I'm going to get killed here.
[272:59.63]And I don't want to go all the way back.
[273:01.44]I don't think there's a checkpoint before this.
[273:04.28]So I'm going to save.
[273:12.14]Don't listen to the haters.
[273:12.96]You did Nancy Drew on senior mode.
[273:16.52]Yeah.
[273:19.16]Yes, I did.
[273:30.18]Where am I going, idiot?
[273:38.79]I wanna go back... Oh, it's this way.
[273:56.12]Did I get any more trinkets to sell?
[273:58.20]Because I kind of want to upgrade the shotgun.
[274:00.36]A well-tuned weapon can make up for a lack of skill, friend.
[274:27.23]This kind of work is about finesse, stranger.
[274:31.19]Little bit goes a long way.
[274:33.93]You'll see.
[274:34.79]Did I already do the Viper thing?
[274:38.60]Did I do the Viper thing already?
[274:41.18]Pleasure doing business with you.
[274:45.32]That should be it, right?
[274:46.22]You're the real professional.
[274:48.20]A job well done deserves payment in kind.
[274:51.74]Well then, what can I do you for?
[274:55.05]There's some things money can't buy.
[274:59.90]Punisher?
[275:00.48]Punisher's kind of cool.
[275:01.36]Should I see what's better?
[275:02.46]We'll just get the laser sight.
[275:09.18]Treasure map?
[275:09.62]I think I already have it.
[275:13.79]It's a bad gun.
[275:19.39]I think I already have the treasure map because I have the deluxe edition.
[275:22.09]Are you guys lying or is that real?
[275:28.18]Let's get the laser.
[275:28.74]Yeah, laser sights.
[275:31.04]Okay, I need parts.
[275:38.21]Laser sight.
[275:40.01]Didn't this used to take up inventory space?
[275:45.75]Did they change that?
[275:46.45]I thought it took up inventory space.
[275:48.97]It still does.
[275:49.73]I thought it was an actual item in the... Oh, it is right there.
[275:56.67]Okay, yeah.
[275:59.72]Yep, OK.
[276:01.92]Got it.
[276:12.21]Do I want to store anything?
[276:24.89]I'm alright.
[276:33.33]Oh, I got a bonus.
[276:44.22]Why is it so dark in your room?
[276:45.66]Uh, because I turned the lights off because it's a scary game.
[276:48.07]Eh, relatively scary.
[276:49.29]I can turn it up a little bit now, though.
[276:54.69]There, that's a little better.
[276:58.96]Sell the necklace, please.
[277:01.32]I don't want to sell the necklace because I want to fill it.
[277:09.33]I want a full necklace because then it's probably worth like 40 grand.
[277:14.82]Get the treasure map.
[277:17.52]I have a yellow, but it's not the right size.
[277:19.34]It needs to be a square or rectangle.
[277:27.07]Okay, let's do this part.
[277:29.07]I'm now confident I have a save point.
[277:35.92]I'm good.
[277:36.64]Let's go.
[277:37.30]Store something.
[277:45.02]Maybe I should just store this.
[277:47.09]Yeah, I like it, but it's taking up a lot of space right now.
[278:01.21]I also need to... I need to throw some flashbangs.
[278:05.14]These things are just taking up so much space.
[278:09.40]Throw some flashbangs.
[278:10.30]Throw some grenades.
[278:11.00]Why are these not in a stack like these are?
[278:19.89]These are in a stack of four.
[278:20.89]Why is that?
[278:22.11]How come these won't stack?
[278:29.30]Oh.
[278:30.56]Oh, that's a hotkey.
[278:32.32]That's, okay.
[278:33.24]I see.
[278:36.98]I can't store the bolts and I don't want to throw the bolts away because how am I going to get any more?
[278:41.44]I don't think you can store ammo.
[278:50.83]Alright, put it down.
[278:55.03]Yeah, I can't store it.
[279:02.30]It's okay.
[279:03.50]I have plenty of room.
[279:05.82]I got plenty of ammo.
[279:07.82]I wouldn't want to use this here anyways because I would lose all the... I'd lose all the bolts anyways.
[279:11.81]Alright, let's go.
[279:13.27]I'm ready.
[279:15.21]Probably going to call it after this encounter here.
[279:28.63]I did say I wanted to put a kind of a cap on it at some point before 3 a.m.
[279:34.74]So here's what's going to happen.
[279:35.62]I'm very happy to play this.
[279:37.50]I cannot wait to keep playing it.
[279:39.30]I'm very excited to continue playing it.
[279:41.62]So here's the plan for this weekend.
[279:43.92]This weekend, we're going to go probably very long on Saturday.
[279:49.98]Saturday is probably going to be a long stream.
[279:51.64]I'm going to really grind this out on Saturday.
[279:54.44]Sunday is going to be another stream where I really kind of grind it out on Sunday.
[280:01.40]think that's probably I should be able to beat it in another three streams or so but I here's the thing I don't want to rush this so I've been obviously this game's awesome it's probably one of the best games it's going to come out this whole year I'm gonna take my time with it so we'll see I'm imagining I'll probably stream it at least probably four or five times yeah it won't be like this uh on Saturday
[280:30.11]Because I had to start really, really late today because it came out really late.
[280:34.15]I was just itching to play it.
[280:47.30]So loud.
[280:50.48]Are you going to do a massive bong rip on cam for 420?
[280:55.59]I don't think so.
[280:59.50]This is so loud.
[281:00.20]Why did it get so much louder?
[281:01.24]Okay, yes.
[281:27.14]You didn't say no.
[281:49.19]Throw harpoons.
[281:49.91]Right in the mouth.
[282:19.46]Where you going?
[282:19.78]Where you going?
[282:20.10]Where you going?
[282:21.84]Where is he?
[282:29.95]Whoa!
[282:30.79]How do I turn?
[282:31.19]Where do I go?
[282:31.58]How do I?
[282:34.02]Why is this not driving?
[282:35.04]Oh, I ran into there.
[282:35.86]What?
[282:36.10]What's going on?
[282:38.02]I'm moving.
[282:41.37]Oh, shit.
[283:15.32]Come on, aim better.
[283:16.28]God damn it.
[283:43.55]Whoa!
[283:49.69]What the hell?
[284:13.61]Where'd you go?
[284:51.64]Oh, that hurt.
[284:57.63]There it is.
[285:09.60]It's just as easy as it was in the original.
[285:11.60]It's a cool fight, though.
[285:18.48]I like it.
[285:30.00]You're playing on the baby mode?
[285:31.55]No, I'm playing on standard.
[285:33.91]Okay.
[285:53.74]That was interesting.
[285:55.77]It's late at night.
[285:56.35]I don't care.
[285:56.69]I'm going to tell you.
[286:02.52]I just was leaning back and I was, I kind of put my hand on like the kind of bottom lower back part of my back just to kind of stretch a little.
[286:10.36]And I ended up like kind of with my other thumb lifted kind of my pants and went, I kind of pulled them out a little like, oh, I'm just going to like the elastic here.
[286:20.10]I'm going to pull back.
[286:22.69]It was like 180 degree air that just came out.
[286:25.65]That was hot.
[286:26.61]It was burning hot air.
[286:28.69]That just came from that area.
[286:30.43]That was like hot.
[286:34.42]Like burning hot.
[286:36.20]I'm telling you, I am on fire all day.
[286:42.12]People think I'm a liar.
[286:43.14]I'm just like on fire.
[286:48.67]I'll take 80%.
[286:48.97]Come on.
[286:57.26]You're sweating?
[286:58.29]Dude, you shit yourself.
[287:12.10]Oh my god, that's so stupid.
[287:16.20]Dude, have you had a fever for the last ten years?
[287:30.23]Sacrificial lamb.
[287:32.71]You will receive our most sacred body.
[287:36.09]It begins now.
[287:39.35]When day breaks, you too will join our covenant to share in my holy blessing.
[288:00.01]That cutscene.
[288:01.11]They're even on in my nightmares.
[288:02.65]I don't know if you would have the sunglasses on in a nightmare.
[288:10.15]These things are welded to his head.
[288:13.54]This is part of his body.
[288:14.44]Those are just his eyes.
[288:27.30]You wouldn't.
[288:38.29]Condor One to Roost.
[288:39.83]Do you read me?
[288:40.57]Condor One?
[288:41.78]You've been radio silent for three hours.
[288:44.36]Are you alright?
[288:45.46]Yeah, I'm fine.
[288:47.33]Why did you sleep in the boat?
[288:50.17]Still looking for whatever key I need.
[288:54.91]I mean, once that big monster is dead, I feel like it's probably relatively safe out there in the boat.
[289:01.72]Kind of away from all the crazy shit.
[289:04.08]Like, once you get rid of the big monster, just be right in the middle of the lake and just go to bed.
[289:08.04]I think you'd be pretty safe.
[289:10.53]Unless there's a second monster, which... Good luck.
[289:15.89]I feel like the first monster encounter would have woken up the second monster.
[289:20.03]So there's definitely no second monster.
[289:22.99]There's no way you sleep through that if you're a second monster.
[289:24.73]If you're a second monster, you hear that and you go investigate.
[289:30.26]Okay.
[289:30.78]I'm going to wrap it up here.
[289:41.72]I'm going to just get to another save point.
[289:45.19]Which I think this one probably right here soon.
[289:48.75]Oh no.
[289:54.64]Cap.
[290:16.66]Okay, I thought that was a demon or something.
[290:18.82]I thought this thing attacked me.
[290:20.10]I thought it was a giant moth.
[290:21.28]I was like, what did they add to the game?
[290:23.42]Why is it?
[290:23.84]What is this?
[290:45.45]I do like the little additions here and there though.
[290:49.45]It's very fun.
[290:50.11]Okay, that's where I came from.
[291:12.45]It just like hurt my eyes.
[291:40.50]What are you doing?
[291:41.36]Somebody said CS:GO maneuver.
[291:43.86]Yeah.
[291:45.28]I was trying to flash them because I think they're up on the hill.
[291:47.36]Imagine you're doing a religious chant up on the hill.
[291:53.47]It's some crazy cult or something else.
[291:55.61]A flashbang lands in front of you.
[291:59.83]Would you notice or would you be still doing this?
[292:02.55]What would happen?
[292:06.49]Do you stop the chant?
[292:08.62]Or is it like...
[292:11.41]We gotta keep going.
[292:12.21]We can't stop.
[292:13.81]How does that work?
[292:14.63]I was wondering what they were going to look like in the remake.
[293:20.41]One for Ocelot!
[293:50.50]What is this place?
[294:01.04]Some kind of shrine.
[294:16.34]Same mark from the church.
[294:28.05]Okay, I need... I need an item here, which I do not have.
[294:36.06]Okay.
[294:52.63]It's the monster.
[295:04.37]Investigate the two locations.
[295:11.36]Okay.
[295:12.76]I have to investigate the... over there.
[295:17.42]Investigate the... over there.
[295:23.44]Very cool.
[295:24.08]Let's go.
[295:28.40]Good morning?
[295:29.16]Oh, that's right.
[295:29.58]It is probably morning for EU, right?
[295:33.04]Morning, EU.
[295:36.22]And good afternoon, Australia.
[295:37.99]Those of you that know, I'm an Australian time zone streamer now.
[296:03.79]It's 8 p.m.
[296:04.71]in Australia right now.
[296:05.89]Wow.
[296:08.33]It's so ridiculous to me just how... Just how far ahead Australia is from the west coast of the United States.
[296:19.52]Wait, what am I... What's going on here?
[296:22.72]Investigate the two locations.
[296:25.48]Because I got to go up here.
[296:27.09]The boat doesn't work though.
[296:28.23]Wait.
[296:28.91]Am I missing something here?
[296:29.87]Did I screw this up?
[296:34.01]I messed this up, didn't I?
[296:34.69]I think I have to go this way.
[296:44.80]Make yourself red.
[296:53.72]I mean, I already am pretty red right now.
[297:03.95]You need to get ready for school, young man.
[297:09.68]I still have school dreams.
[297:14.58]I didn't even see this.
[297:17.36]Sometimes I have dreams where, oh no, I gotta turn a paper in.
[297:20.88]It's like, dude, I have not been in a classroom in like 15 to 20 years.
[297:26.37]And I still think that.
[297:28.81]I'm like, wait, ugh.
[297:31.65]I didn't turn my paper in.
[297:33.49]I'm fucked.
[297:35.26]And it's like I wake up and I'm like, I'm like 40.
[297:37.52]Yeah, I kind of look like moths.
[297:57.19]Someone fetched me a rare golden chicken egg.
[297:59.73]What will I do with it?
[298:00.82]Well, sometimes it's more fun not knowing.
[298:06.70]Those drop pretty frequently, from what I remember.
[298:08.56]Alright, I want to go... If I remember this... Let me see...
[298:31.68]I think there's stuff over here.
[298:33.10]There is.
[298:43.53]I do remember the boat.
[298:46.31]What was in here?
[298:46.87]I think it's like a jewel or something.
[298:51.87]There we go.
[298:52.57]Alright.
[298:53.05]I just made like 40 grand.
[298:58.11]I can I can complete that necklace, whatever it is.
[299:14.07]Red nine.
[299:26.72]That thing's pretty good from what I remember.
[299:29.84]I might just upgrade that thing to full.
[299:34.14]That gun used to be the beast.
[299:36.94]That is the right one, right?
[299:37.99]That's the one that you just always use.
[299:39.59]That one, they probably fixed it.
[299:40.79]They probably changed it so the other stuff is better.
[299:42.29]I remember that thing was unstoppable.
[299:50.53]Okay, I need... Honestly, I need a...
[299:57.36]I need to save.
[300:01.40]Where's the nearest save point?
[300:02.54]I'm gonna go this way.
[300:12.76]Probably in here.
[300:13.36]Wait a minute.
[300:18.62]He was gonna go to bed 20 minutes ago.
[300:19.96]I need a save point.
[300:21.18]Get out of the way.
[300:44.80]If you don't save I will drink a Dasani.
[301:01.46]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[301:04.82]What?
[301:06.02]Come on, dude.
[301:07.58]What are you talking about?
[301:24.07]You know, I actually... Holly and I did a water taste test just for fun one day.
[301:32.17]And I don't remember, I think Dasani was not even that low for me.
[301:38.27]Yeah, we just do things sometimes.
[301:40.94]We just hang out together.
[301:43.92]I forget what my favorite one was.
[301:46.14]My number one was.
[302:01.11]Yeah, Dasani was not even really that low.
[302:06.19]It was pretty low, but it wasn't like F. I probably would surprise people with where I put something.
[302:15.06]I'm going to get punched in the face for saying this, I think.
[302:25.96]Someone is going to be very upset with me.
[302:30.82]Here they go.
[302:31.36]They're already punching.
[302:33.64]They're already punching.
[302:40.57]Core water?
[302:44.87]I think it was pretty low.
[302:49.99]I didn't really like core water.
[303:00.01]The one with the blue cap, it's blue, it's kind of slim.
[303:04.38]Looks like it's got a blue twist-off, big blue twist-off cap.
[303:16.38]Yeah.
[303:19.20]Um... What did I give?
[303:22.00]Wait, I gave Dasani a B?
[303:26.60]No, I gave... No, I didn't.
[303:29.41]I gave Dasani a B. No, no, no, no, no, that's wrong, that's wrong, that's wrong, that's wrong.
[303:34.65]That's not.
[303:38.93]Smart Water was an A?
[303:47.20]You're sleep deprived.
[303:48.10]Show the list.
[303:51.42]We don't really have a list.
[303:54.50]No, Dasani was a C.
[303:58.75]But core was the lowest for me.
[304:03.50]What about tap water?
[304:07.66]Depends on where you fucking live.
[304:11.20]Some tap water tastes very different.
[304:16.00]I don't know.
[304:16.88]Vegas tap water versus California tap water versus Hawaii tap water versus Massachusetts tap water.
[304:23.99]I don't know.
[304:25.27]They're very different.
[304:31.09]New York City tap water.
[304:32.19]Yeah, it's very different.
[304:33.53]New York City tap water versus Vegas tap water, I assure you, is very different.
[304:37.21]Oh my goodness.
[304:43.64]Okay.
[304:45.72]Our water is fine.
[304:47.46]I don't prefer it asani, though.
[304:49.62]Smart water is usually what I would want.
[304:53.80]Fiji doesn't count for me because Fiji would just blow everything away.
[304:58.94]I don't think I'm allowed to put it on the list.
[305:04.84]I don't know.
[305:05.64]Isn't Fiji... Fiji's like... You can't even come close.
[305:13.58]I don't buy Fiji, though.
[305:15.09]I don't actually buy it.
[305:16.89]You know where I buy Fiji water?
[305:18.47]It's one of the only places I buy it.
[305:20.79]The airport.
[305:23.95]That's it.
[305:25.77]I don't ever buy it anywhere else.
[305:27.37]It's just at the airport.
[305:31.04]And it's funny because Fiji's already kind of expensive, isn't it?
[305:34.75]So it's even more expensive at the airport.
[305:37.65]So I'm buying arguably one of the more expensive waters on Earth at the most expensive place on Earth.
[305:45.41]It's like the water is very, very expensive in the airport.
[305:51.35]Vacation packaging.
[305:56.96]Crystal Geyser is S. Actually, I would probably agree with you.
[306:02.58]Alright.
[306:10.37]That's a weird flex.
[306:12.23]No, I just told you I don't buy it.
[306:14.46]I buy it at the airport.
[306:16.19]which is just like, oh yeah, sure, Fiji.
[306:18.17]You know what it is?
[306:19.23]Because you want to make sure, like anytime I travel, I want to make sure that I am in peak performance mode, peak physical hydration, peak mental fortitude.
[306:29.80]And a Fiji water to me is like, alright, that's good shit.
[306:34.40]And I'm going to make sure I drink that because I'm about to go on an airplane.
[306:38.66]I want it to be the best because I'm going on a plane.
[306:42.39]Planes suck already.
[306:43.69]Everybody knows that.
[306:48.83]Alright, we'll see you Saturday.
[306:54.61]I need to be peak performance to get on a plane.
[306:57.68]Doesn't matter.
[307:08.99]What would you do if you got the T-Virus?
[307:12.85]Um...
[307:18.45]I'm going to close myself off in a room and just, I don't know, like booby trap the room I'm in because like the T-virus is going to get out of me and try to get out.
[307:29.94]Like it's going to be like an alien, right?
[307:32.32]So I'll just like booby trap the whole room and just stay in there.
[307:35.80]And then eventually like it'll get out and it'll like run into the fucking Home Alone shit that I made for it.
[307:41.36]It won't know.
[307:43.76]It'll be like... Like out of my chest.
[307:47.30]And go to the door like... And then a big paint can just... It's right in the face.
[307:53.22]And it falls back onto the toy cars I put all over the ground.
[307:57.78]I would contain it.
[308:08.70]His ass is not ready to stop streaming.
[308:10.54]No, I'm good.
[308:11.14]I'm good.
[308:11.48]It's getting late.
[308:15.95]Alright, we'll pick it up on Saturday.
[308:16.89]Thanks for watching, guys.
[308:19.39]Very late.
[308:19.83]Very late.
[308:22.24]Take care of yourselves.
[308:25.78]It's been real.
[308:27.08]The game is phenomenal.
[308:29.60]I kind of was anticipating it would be.
[308:34.64]It's just really, really cool.
[308:38.37]It feels like visiting an old friend that
[308:43.09]It's like doing real good.
[308:45.11]Doing real well for themselves.
[308:47.35]Right?
[308:47.71]It's just like, holy shit, you're doing well.
[308:49.35]Cool.
[308:49.83]Alright.
[308:50.49]You're doing great.
[308:51.11]It's like, good to see you again.
[308:59.03]Yeah.
[309:00.25]Thanks for the raise too.
[309:01.49]CDawg came in with a huge one.
[309:02.93]Over $320,000 raised.
[309:09.70]Which is amazing.
[309:11.40]If you're still here from CDawg's raid, thanks.
[309:16.27]Maybe we'll see you again another time.
[309:19.35]Among all the others that obviously raided too.
[309:25.33]What about Hitman?
[309:26.29]Oh man, I know.
[309:28.99]I've got such a backlog of things I've told you I wanted to do.
[309:41.89]Yeah, CDawg's awesome.
[309:46.24]Spent some quality time hung out with CDawg at the Streamer Awards.
[309:51.80]He's really cool.
[309:55.40]Super chill, dude.
[310:01.05]Alright.
[310:04.28]Breath of the Wild will be next week.
[310:06.42]I want to finish Resident Evil 4 first.
[310:09.30]As long as that takes us.
[310:10.20]Maybe three streams?
[310:11.18]Four streams?
[310:13.13]Maybe?
[310:14.87]I guess it depends on how fast I go through it.
[310:21.77]Take care of yourselves.
[310:22.53]Get some sleep or good morning.
[310:23.95]Hope you have a good day.
[310:31.68]Some of you are probably just starting your weekend.
[310:36.67]We'll see you Saturday.
[310:37.65]So technically tomorrow, technically.
[310:42.69]Because it is technically Friday right now.
[310:44.81]We'll see you Saturday.
[310:51.31]Call your mother.
[310:53.15]See you soon.
[311:08.29]you
[311:43.15]you
[312:18.04]you
