[00:06.10]Featuring Krabby Patty and Fortnite mobile.
[00:10.92]That's me.
[00:11.90]I'm that guy.
[00:12.78]I'm your guy.
[00:13.36]Somebody wrote that.
[00:16.54]I didn't just say that.
[00:18.62]No one said that.
[00:19.24]Yeah, like 30 people did.
[00:21.26]Hey, DestroyDude, thanks for the vibe.
[00:22.70]Give me 30 subs right off the bat here.
[00:27.57]Welcome back, everybody.
[00:29.99]We're gonna continue our trek through VR.
[00:34.39]We are not going to play Half- Alyx today.
[00:37.96]That is reserved for tomorrow and Tuesday.
[00:40.96]I'm hoping to get through Half- Alyx.
[00:43.70]Either tomorrow or Tuesday.
[00:46.04]I've heard it's about a 10 to 15 hour long experience.
[00:48.58]Thinking maybe three streams will do it.
[00:52.67]Maybe.
[00:54.91]One of the scary games...
[00:57.71]I have, like, at least five scary VR games downloaded.
[01:02.96]We'll get to them.
[01:03.84]Wait till... It's not Halloween yet.
[01:07.54]Wait till at least, like, the week of Halloween.
[01:10.72]I don't do, like, October every day is a scary day.
[01:14.38]When is Chubby Bunny?
[01:16.38]That's gonna happen next week.
[01:20.02]Fucking Chubby Bunny.
[01:23.76]Patience is a virtue.
[01:24.72]Yeah.
[01:24.92]Hey, TheFoolie, thanks for the five.
[01:26.29]Get me out of these subs.
[01:28.58]He's a liar, liar, liar.
[01:29.88]I'm not a liar.
[01:30.82]Look, you... I'm not... And by the way... People think I'm gonna die if I do Chubby Bunny.
[01:37.62]I'm not gonna do Chubby Bunny until I die.
[01:40.14]I don't know why you think that's gonna happen.
[01:44.78]I'm gonna do like seven marshmallows and then we're gonna call it a day.
[01:50.23]I'm not gonna die.
[01:56.46]Chubby Bunny's gonna put him in a wheelchair.
[01:58.20]That's not gonna happen, dude.
[02:06.41]But for now, we have a few games I want to go through.
[02:10.55]Very importantly, the main thing today is The Room VR.
[02:17.93]I made a video like seven years ago about The Room.
[02:24.08]It's one of my favorite series.
[02:26.04]And I'm not even kidding.
[02:26.88]It's an iPad series.
[02:28.66]Hold on.
[02:29.16]Don't be such a dick yet.
[02:31.78]It's on Steam.
[02:32.52]They ported it to Steam like three or four years ago.
[02:35.82]It's this like box inside of a box inside of a box puzzle game.
[02:40.10]It's so much fun.
[02:41.86]They made a VR version of it.
[02:44.28]And it's not just a VR version of the first game.
[02:47.72]Or, oh yeah, we like slapped some goggles on you and we gave you hands.
[02:51.52]No.
[02:52.37]It's a completely from the ground up VR game experience.
[02:57.15]So fuck yeah, that's what we're doing today.
[03:00.64]But before that, I think that's at least a couple hours.
[03:03.86]We're going to do some just VR fucking bacon wrapped cheese.
[03:07.52]Bacon wrapped scallops.
[03:10.60]Look at Resident Sleeve, it's been four minutes, dude.
[03:16.78]You can't show up to the concert.
[03:20.17]and they're like just before the concert music is playing.
[03:26.14]Alright, what's the lineup today?
[03:28.12]Oh, we've got Blink-182, we've got Kanye, and the main event is Skrillex.
[03:37.38]It's like, oh, nice.
[03:39.30]Okay, I can't wait.
[03:41.05]I'm at the concert now.
[03:43.33]Oh, this is boring.
[03:45.65]Turn off this like before the concert music.
[03:48.05]Where's Skrillex?
[03:49.37]That's what I'm here for.
[03:50.41]I don't want to sit here for four hours and wait for Skrillex.
[03:53.01]Get him on now.
[03:58.53]It's true.
[03:59.77]You don't ResidentSleeper at a concert.
[04:01.37]If you ResidentSleeper at a concert, you may have the wrong choice of music.
[04:09.95]Start the stream.
[04:10.77]I need my crack.
[04:14.63]Oh, this guy sucks.
[04:15.71]This music sucks.
[04:18.31]Oh, boo.

[04:24.28]Oh, they were $180 a piece.
[04:26.94]Oh.
[04:29.88]You like this music?
[04:31.56]No, you do.
[04:33.10]I'm just humoring you by coming to a concert that you wanted to go to.

[05:26.83]You guys know that time has passed since the last stream, right?
[05:33.30]This is not like...
[05:35.64]12 hours after the last stream, just because the last stream happened.
[05:39.77]I've watched this by hand.
[05:43.37]How did they even take this off?
[05:44.29]And dude, you know what's something weird about headbands?
[05:47.83]I feel like that blood is being constricted to my brain.
[05:52.71]I hate these.
[05:54.16]I feel like it takes longer for me to say sentences right now.
[05:57.18]Is that weird?
[06:03.70]Kind of feels weird.
[06:04.20]Alright, let's go.

[23:40.68]We had a five from Donut.
[23:42.52]Thank you, Donut.
[23:43.12]And then $50 from Zurich Da.
[23:46.14]5,000 bits to say love you, big man.
[23:49.06]Thanks a lot, dude.
[23:50.24]That's a shitload of money.
[23:53.16]That's an extreme amount of money.
[23:56.16]I'll take it.
[23:57.24]And I will spend it.
[23:59.98]Worst possible way.
[24:06.04]Okay, let's get this up.
[24:09.28]And here we go.
[24:14.46]Should be able to see now.
[24:16.08]There you go.
[24:16.62]Okay.
[24:19.94]What does it want me to do?
[24:23.30]Re-center.
[24:23.82]Hold on.
[24:26.91]Re-center your view until the windows are in the correct position.
[24:30.41]Press R to reload.
[24:31.81]Press Enter to finish calibration.
[24:36.83]Holy shit.
[24:39.56]Dude.
[24:41.26]I got, you know...
[24:43.57]I haven't even done it in VR.
[24:45.41]When you sit on a couch and you have a pretend like 5,000 foot screen, that's what this is.
[24:49.63]I'm at like a movie theater right now.
[24:52.83]This is a seated experience.
[24:55.30]What?
[24:56.68]Okay, press R to reload window positions.
[24:58.86]I'm going to press R. Does it really matter?
[25:08.76]Good.
[25:10.26]Okay.
[25:11.86]Press enter to finish or toggle edit mode with VR controllers.
[25:17.00]Sit, seat comfortably.
[25:18.32]Please seat comfortable in the chair and activate both VR controllers.
[25:23.79]No, this is good.
[25:24.33]This is fine.
[25:25.65]So, but how do I get the, I have to press enter?
[25:32.95]I'm ready.
[25:33.27]You ready?
[25:33.55]I can stand up on the bike.
[25:39.82]I'll be fine.
[25:44.74]Both controllers are activated.
[25:45.80]How am I going home?
[25:54.13]Oh.
[25:59.63]How do I go home?
[26:00.23]Did it crash?
[26:07.43]Game crashed.
[26:12.02]How did it crash?
[26:15.51]How does a game like that crash?
[26:17.03]Why does it want me to host a Minecraft room?
[26:26.88]Because I wasn't sitting down.
[26:28.12]Well, what the f- Alright, I am now.

[27:08.48]Alright, well, we're not playing that one, I guess.
[27:15.78]That one looked fucking really cool, too.
[27:18.48]That's unfortunate.
[27:20.80]Well, we got a whole shitload, so it doesn't really matter.

[89:15.44]My graphics cards suck so bad.
[89:17.32]Why does my computer suck?
[89:30.80]Combine spells?
[89:33.92]No, you cannot combine.
[89:48.43]That's just a shitty magic trick.
[89:52.15]I gotta drop the graphics even more.
[89:54.07]Oh, that looks so bad.
[90:19.91]Hit the 30-90 already?
[90:21.59]I would have got the 30-90, but they made like 15 of them.
[90:24.30]Alright, what about this canyon?
[90:39.87]Find the purple one.
[91:19.60]It's nothing!
[91:24.99]Oh, fuck!

[96:15.52]Get place-based boundaries.
[96:17.38]Ah, well, here, let me, I'm gonna come in close for you here.
[96:20.59]The reason why I don't have place, uh, place-based boundaries is because, um, well, I have it at standing room only, but I still move around like I'm a fucking dickhead.
[96:36.22]I have to move around, I can't not move around in VR.
[96:41.44]Oh, how long, alright, let me go take a piss.
[96:44.68]And make sure that I didn't like scuff up the front of my head.
[100:17.19]Alright, let's see.
[100:22.54]I'm fine.
[100:23.14]Look.

[107:20.25]Battle for glory.
[107:22.17]You're leading the way to victory.
[107:23.75]Fight among your people and the Empire.
[107:26.29]Alright.

[108:33.62]Don't move.
[108:34.80]Don't you move.
[108:36.50]Are you listening to me?
[108:37.76]You and I are going to team up.
[108:40.32]If we're going to team up, we're going to kill those guys over there.
[108:42.71]You understand?
[108:46.91]Don't do it.
[108:57.75]Hey!
[109:00.87]Fuck!
[109:02.13]Fuck!
[109:08.28]Alright, get out of my way.
[109:46.32]I can grab his hand?

[110:04.11]Let's go!
[110:05.51]It's time to go home!
[110:06.61]Get in the car!
[110:08.31]Come on!
[110:15.65]Come here!
[110:16.53]Let's go.
[110:20.87]Let's go.
[110:21.39]Come on.
[110:21.65]You're ruining my fucking joke.
[110:38.68]It's so laggy I can't even play.
[110:57.84]Come on, I can't even see what I'm doing.
[111:06.05]I'm about to crash this fucking computer, man.
[111:16.56]Why?
[111:30.74]I've had, I've had just about enough of you.
[111:34.26]Give me the axe.
[111:53.51]What the fuck fucking killed me?

[111:59.28]Oh my god, it's so laggy.
[112:04.62]Punk.
[112:06.08]No honor among thieves, no honor among thieves.
[112:08.62]There ain't no honor among thieves anymore.
[112:14.42]Okay, well let's go.
[112:25.27]Update fucked up performance by a lot.
[112:28.39]Really?
[112:29.69]Yeah, this feels like really bad.
[112:36.35]Even when we come, usually it gets back to like 80, 60, 70, 80 frames a second.
[112:39.82]You know what I'm saying?
[112:48.02]You know what I mean?
[112:49.76]It's like a memory leak or something.
[112:52.76]I don't know.
[112:53.02]What does that mean?
[113:00.92]Post-processing?
[113:04.82]NES resolution.
[113:27.32]It feels the same.
[113:33.70]Next game.
[113:34.10]Am I doing next game?
[113:43.31]Enable motion smoothing?
[113:45.21]Projection in SteamVR.
[113:48.77]1v1 game mode.
[113:54.10]Using more processing power than the graphics card.
[113:57.82]Ah, we'll move on.
[113:58.36]We'll play the room.
[113:59.58]It's time to relax.
[114:01.16]It's time for the relaxing portion of this room.
[114:06.38]Saw 2.
[114:07.22]I'm gonna download the lightsaber thing.
[114:09.92]Yeah, this game is fucking hilarious though.
[114:16.78]It's so much fun.
[114:17.58]It just kind of runs like shit lately.
[114:20.30]Like I would know.
[114:20.90]Alright, let's play The Room.
[114:24.82]It's time to chill out.
[114:26.57]I'm looking forward to this.
[114:27.47]I've actually been waiting for this.
[114:29.21]When I heard this came out, I was ecstatic.
[114:39.47]Wait till you- This is gonna be the ultimate in POG video games.
[114:42.27]You guys are gonna be so happy about this.
[114:45.51]Okay, where is it?
[114:46.35]The room.
[114:46.75]Alright, here we go!
[115:00.70]Oh, this is what I think it is?
[115:03.16]It's gonna be awesome.
[115:05.30]It's gonna be fucking fantastic, I can't wait.

[115:48.17]Yeah, this looks good.
[115:54.41]That brings me back.
[115:55.33]Yeah!
[115:55.77]And look, we have actual frames.
[116:02.07]Are you already disappointed?
[116:03.13]Time that person up for 30 seconds.
[116:05.27]I have no idea.
[116:12.84]The room VR dark matter supports multiple profiles.
[116:15.62]I'm sure it does.
[116:17.62]This is a game about... Okay, let me give you an example.
[116:20.12]This is a game about... It's a game about... And about... You'll understand soon enough.
[116:39.43]I need hints sometimes.
[116:40.83]It can be kind of fucking hard.
[116:45.74]Standing.

[117:25.59]Grab the projector handle.
[117:33.91]Dozens of disappearances in just a few weeks, but this is one of the strangest.
[117:37.49]Storage area of the British Institute of Archaeology where the professor was last seen.
[117:46.17]How can someone disappear from such a secure building?
[117:49.09]Leave.
[117:54.03]Dr. Montgomery specialized in priceless Egyptian relics.
[117:56.75]He told colleagues he was on the verge of some great discovery.
[118:01.51]There you are.
[118:07.96]This is the piece the professor was studying when he disappeared.
[118:18.87]Nothing else was missing, no evidence of a struggle or break-in.
[118:21.30]It doesn't make sense.
[118:22.26]I should check my desk in case the sergeant has left a report.
[118:31.84]The early gentleman was asking after you.
[118:33.52]He gave me a parcel, said it would help with the disappearances.
[118:36.20]I swear the damn thing was making the strangest noise.
[118:40.37]The constable told me he was hearing things.
[118:42.55]I put it in your wall safe if you want, whatever.

[119:22.94]There's something in evidence storage.
[119:24.50]Gotta go to evidence storage.
[119:30.46]I cannot wait to fucking play this game.
[119:34.63]Evidence storage.
[119:36.25]I'm sure we confiscated something that can help me crack a save.
[119:39.05]It'll be listed on the blackboard.
[119:44.79]Oh, safecracking!
[119:46.50]William Crack.
[119:48.50]He cracks saves.
[119:50.02]William Clark.
[119:51.44]Safecracking.
[119:52.50]Box number, I don't know.
[119:56.54]Please file evidence with the correct case number for easy retrieval.
[119:59.24]The filing system isn't that complicated.
[120:01.00]Your detectives work it out.
[120:04.00]John E. Assault, E3.
[120:09.24]Alden Wright, WW2.
[120:12.25]William Crack, C6.

[121:50.42]Why is the mic fucked up?
[121:51.58]The mic is fucked up.
[121:56.72]What did I do to it?
[121:57.40]I don't know.
[122:03.46]Was it when I bumped into it?
[122:04.56]When I smashed into it?
[122:14.41]Maybe when I hit it.
[122:16.82]Sounds the same.
[122:17.66]I don't know.
[122:18.97]Alright, how do I put this?
[122:19.73]How do I get this on here?
[122:20.97]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[122:22.27]This should not... There's a hint available to pull the tip.
[122:28.93]Now that I have the safe cracker, I can get to work on the safe.
[122:31.13]Yeah, I... What do you... Oh, it's so satisfying.
[122:53.19]I love it.
[122:55.55]I'm gonna turn some dials here Shit almost
[123:21.47]Loves it.
[123:22.24]I do love it.
[123:42.30]Forgive my unorthodox approach, detective, but I have vital information relating to a case you're investigating.
[123:48.61]I have questions, so please take these lenses and let me show you what I can explain.
[123:52.31]This is only the beginning.
[123:53.41]Craftsman.
[124:03.34]Ow!
[124:04.52]Take the lenses?
[124:20.27]I got- wait, wait, wait, wait.
[124:26.70]Ooh, the first box!
[124:34.34]I mean, usually it's like a box with a box, and then a box inside of a box.
[124:39.25]Open the inventory and pull the highlighted tab to put on the eyepiece.
[124:48.40]The-
[124:49.17]What the fuck is going on in there?
[125:03.52]Alright, this is the real first box.
[125:05.14]You don't have any idea how happy I am to be playing this.
[125:11.34]Alright, so what do we got?
[125:12.66]Let's examine the box!
[125:17.38]Got that.
[125:19.36]about this.

[126:13.37]Wait a minute.
[126:17.91]Yes!
[126:26.08]This is the VR made room.
[126:46.17]Welcome, detective, to the hidden realm of the null.
[126:48.69]The disappearances you are investigating are part of something more sinister than you can imagine.
[126:52.65]I can show you what happened to these people, and perhaps together we can avert any further loss.
[126:58.20]This document is no ordinary letter.
[127:00.24]The null connects it to me, its author.
[127:03.32]Use the eyepiece to reveal the connection.
[127:05.24]Find the others.
[127:06.20]Discover their fates.
[127:07.78]The Craftsman.
[127:16.58]Oh my god.
[127:26.39]Okay.
[127:27.41]Alright.
[127:28.49]The British Institute of Archaeology.

[130:00.03]Shit, that means something.
[130:08.07]What does that mean?
[130:08.57]Is that the mic sensitivity?
[130:19.52]Why are people talking about the mic?
[130:24.95]I must have fucked something up when I punched it and ripped out a cord or something.
[130:34.79]Is this the wrong mic?
[130:36.81]No.
[130:38.23]Oh, when I turn around, you can't hear me.
[130:39.65]I get you.
[130:40.07]Alright.
[130:40.51]Well, we can't... We gotta get something that fits in here.

[132:10.82]Circle.
[132:23.33]Face ward.
[132:29.34]I don't have any face wards, dude.
[132:38.49]What am I missing?
[132:39.19]I'm missing something here.
[132:51.86]Like, open that, but I can't.
[132:55.82]Can I not get this all the way?
[132:56.74]That's open.
[133:03.86]Not even in the cameras.
[133:06.00]Oh, fuck, I thought that was a real wall.
[133:14.17]Hey, I'm back.
[133:15.49]How are ya?
[133:32.34]I can't pick that up.
[133:34.94]What did I miss here?
[133:35.80]Something's here that I missed.
[133:37.08]I guess I could just...
[133:44.50]We could go somewhere else.
[133:48.02]We have to go somewhere else.
[133:58.85]Oh, what was that?
[133:59.47]That's a sarcophagus.
[134:00.43]Nice beer gun.
[134:14.59]Door is unlocked, but too heavy to open by hand.
[134:16.65]There's a rope attached to it that leads to a set of pulleys, though.
[134:20.35]Yeah, I know.
[134:23.99]Beer gut.
[134:24.67]It's not a beer gut.
[134:26.21]It's a... There has to be something with this.
[134:37.30]Put by hand, so I need to do this thing.
[134:44.41]How do I open this?
[134:47.39]Coming out, but it can't... This is way better than Nancy Drew.
[134:55.16]Ayo got made... Shut up!
[134:59.92]A turkey peanut oil diet.
[135:01.76]Go to the right side of the door?
[135:06.56]Yeah, but I can't really go over here.
[135:20.95]Like this is connected to that.
[135:26.01]How do I get this to move?
[135:36.08]How do I get this to like, how do I get this to turn?
[135:46.69]Get the fuck out of the goddamn way.
[135:57.98]Let's have punch whatever's in front of me.
[136:01.00]But I can't, can I pull?
[136:02.91]Oh, shit!
[136:21.36]Look at that.
[136:22.42]Let's go, get this shit out.
[136:33.20]Oh yeah.
[136:34.47]That's a big guy right there.
[136:46.53]Porter was back, asking about my progress.
[136:48.37]A curious fellow, he seemed almost amused that I couldn't crack the code.
[136:52.93]He gave me a parcel, said it had been left for me in the post room.
[136:57.40]Inside was an odd-looking lens along with a note that said the lens would help me in my work.
[137:02.34]Goodness knows that it was gonna help me.
[137:12.61]What do you got?
[137:17.89]Alright, hit him in the head with a crowbar.
[137:21.33]Oh, shit.
[137:21.79]Brass.
[137:22.27]Wait.
[137:27.52]Fuck.
[137:32.10]Wait, wait.
[137:32.52]Wasn't there a circle somewhere that needed a circle?
[137:34.18]Nothing needed a circle.
[137:45.46]Here?
[137:50.12]Where did this need to go?
[137:50.80]Cursor for Cursor J... Now it's on the screen.

[139:53.64]Did I do it?
[140:05.20]Everybody understand what just happened?
[140:06.30]I had to unlock.
[140:09.56]Yeah, I did.
[140:10.04]But how do I open it?
[140:10.82]It should be unlocked then, right?
[140:24.95]That easy?
[140:25.65]Or am I doing something wrong?
[140:26.45]I feel like you have to move this.
[140:34.97]Please smash the Reddit shelf.
[140:37.92]I don't want that to happen.
[140:38.98]There's got to be something I'm doing wrong here.
[140:42.84]I need something to put in there.
[140:50.24]Oh, that AC feels so fucking good right now.

[145:33.14]Let's go back over here The reason why this game is so much fun
[145:43.93]Alright, let me fucking actually talk to you guys.
[145:46.58]The reason why this game is fun is because one thing leads to another thing, another thing leads to this, and that opens that, that opens that box, and then that box opens on its own.
[145:57.00]Wait.
[146:01.58]Wait.
[146:01.72]Am I gonna match?
[146:10.47]Okay, hold on, give me a minute.

[146:59.41]That's it!
[146:59.71]I got it!
[147:00.21]I did it!
[147:09.82]Let's go!
[147:10.44]Open up!
[147:21.34]The hell did that do?
[147:29.21]Stuck his tongue out at me.
[147:40.93]I can't.
[147:58.63]I can't even look at it now.
[148:00.65]You guys have ruined it for me.
[148:01.95]I can't.
[148:03.06]Somebody said one thing and that's all it took.
[148:12.72]Okay.
[148:13.22]Well, now what do I do?
[148:20.83]These were instructions on how to do the first part.
[148:23.03]I'm such an idiot.
[148:26.97]Wait, it came out of all four places.
[148:35.86]Not over here, right?
[148:40.25]What else did I not do?
[148:43.45]Over here?
[149:02.68]I don't understand this part.
[149:07.01]I'm looking for an animal.
[149:10.05]I guess we could just... It's one out of four chance.
[149:12.53]Of course we could just guess.
[149:13.47]What is this?
[149:13.91]Uh, yep.
[149:20.42]Another one of those.
[149:34.75]Flamingo.
[149:35.23]It's a one out of four chance.
[149:46.18]Okay.
[149:46.84]I'm going to get from that box.
[149:48.46]I am going to get a flamingo.
[149:53.63]Why does the cursor keep coming back?
[150:01.09]I'm not doing that.
[150:04.72]You look at where I am.
[150:05.68]I'm clearly across the whole room.
[150:06.82]Alright, think.
[150:11.02]Think for a second.
[150:12.58]Think.
[150:12.82]Can't move this.
[150:25.51]There's a tool that I'm going to be able to slide in here and then pull this out.
[150:30.53]Press her again?
[150:31.41]No.
[150:36.24]The pulley system can lift up the mummy, can it?
[150:43.14]Oh my goodness, look at you.
[150:47.24]What would you just say?
[150:51.74]Put a different pulley now.
[150:54.22]Is there a dog?
[151:02.63]Oh shit, look at this!
[151:11.80]I'm pretty strong in this.
[151:13.09]I knew that was going to happen.
[151:18.83]Pull it back up.
[151:19.91]Ooh, okay.
[151:31.77]It is a dog.
[151:33.35]It's Otto.
[151:37.24]He can't really come in here right now.
[151:40.16]What am I going to do about that?
[151:42.60]He can't come in here right now.
[151:43.88]I'll be like, oh, Otto, where is he?
[151:46.22]I don't want to step on him.
[151:47.34]Let me go see what he wants.
[151:52.08]Let him in.
[151:53.20]That's dangerous.
[151:54.56]I could hurt him.
[151:58.97]Hold on.
[151:59.93]Let me go see what he wants.
[152:03.03]Holden Orb.
[152:06.93]Let me go see what he wants.
[152:08.31]Maybe he wants a good...
[152:11.55]One sec.
[152:12.06]I'll be right back.
[153:29.61]Yeah, he's here.
[153:32.01]He's in the room.
[153:33.47]I just wanted to come in.
[153:34.15]He's all the way in the corner over there.
[153:36.35]So he's not in any play area.
[153:40.13]There's no reason why I would go all the way over there.
[153:43.87]Tell him?
[153:44.27]Tell him what I'm doing.
[153:51.90]Right over here.
[153:56.98]He just wanted to come and lie down on a blanket.
[154:06.55]He is like, there's no reason why I would go over there.
[154:09.73]He just wanted to come in and hang out.
[154:11.07]You said that's all you wanted?
[154:15.55]We did it, boys.
[154:16.59]Hey, you having fun in the room?
[154:20.74]I'm looking forward to this game for like a hundred years.
[154:35.76]Half-Life: Alyx, like, we're doing that tomorrow.
[154:40.82]And that's what we're doing the whole stream, so that's why I want to play a few of the games that I had lined up that are not Half-Life: Alyx.
[154:51.71]That's what we're doing all stream tomorrow.
[154:59.35]It looked fun, too.
[155:03.55]That's the worst part about it.
[155:11.46]What game is this?
[155:12.22]This is called The Room VR A Dark Matter.
[155:21.21]Mouse on screen?
[155:21.85]No.
[155:25.15]I don't have a feed.
[155:31.37]Huh.
[155:31.53]I don't know what happened here, but... If we can get back to normal, that would be good.
[155:44.52]Alright, so thanks for the one guy.
[155:45.68]That was really good advice to lift up the sarcophagus with the other thing.
[155:49.17]Pretty sick.
[156:04.38]Come on, I need my team of assistants to play VR.
[156:10.00]gonna be like three people in the room, one to make sure I don't hit a wall, one to make sure I can hear the audio.
[156:16.60]Until I take care of my dog.
[156:28.37]Oh, we were right here.
[156:34.04]Oh, I got that ball.
[156:44.14]I know, I'm gonna run into that.
[156:45.71]I could sense the shelf.
[156:47.39]I could smell it.
[156:52.03]Whoa, I got his beard.
[156:55.92]I can't, like, take his beard off?
[156:58.78]What is this for?

[172:35.06]Is he going to be alive behind me?
[172:36.12]He's going to be alive behind me, isn't he?
[172:38.42]Ugh.

[172:56.07]Holy shit.
[172:56.67]Okay.
[172:56.99]He's always been here.
[173:00.07]He's always been here.
[173:00.95]Since the beginning.
[173:01.67]Waiting.
[173:02.57]Waiting at the beginning.
[173:03.55]At the temple.
[173:04.48]They all wait at the beginning.
[173:05.68]I see them.
[173:06.26]They aren't blind like me.
[173:07.60]Did Trump write this?
[173:17.66]Where are we going?
[173:19.11]Oh, the beginning.
[173:19.73]Okay.
[173:39.36]I feel like I'm at Disney World right now.
[173:40.86]It's like a Disney ride.
[173:42.18]It's a good one, though.
[173:46.47]Oh, but this is the... Where do I put this?
[173:48.81]Oh, hey, loading.
[173:58.40]That.
[174:01.52]I have two more of those to do.
[174:12.81]Another note.
[174:15.61]Long one.
[174:17.23]Welcome back, Detective.
[174:18.15]Perhaps now you can understand the danger we face.
[174:21.74]I mean, I don't really... I don't really know what the danger is, but I guess it's scary.
[174:26.24]The artifact you collected now holds the very essence, the soul, if you will, of the Professor.
[174:31.56]Sacrifice will help further my work and bring these arcane forces safely under my control.
[174:38.04]Onward to another of those lost unfortunates.
[174:40.97]A servant of God this time.
[174:42.59]He was searching for some long-forgotten relic.
[174:45.45]You must uncover what he found.
[174:47.19]The crackhead.
[174:52.63]Here we go.
[175:05.90]Ooh, we're in a church.
[175:06.58]Church.
[175:08.32]Perhaps this reverend will have some answers for me.
[175:13.17]Hmm.
[175:23.16]Okay.
[175:23.36]Let's go.
[175:23.72]Let's start our search.
[175:28.38]A box!
[175:31.68]And it's just a big-ass key in here.
[175:33.48]You got it.
[175:34.04]Cool.
[175:34.14]Cool.
[175:36.92]Okay, we got door in front, thing on the left, go left.
[175:44.63]Oh, this is the podium.
[175:46.19]Okay.
[175:48.65]Here.
[175:50.41]Six, one, five, eight, seven, three, nine, eight, one, four.
[175:53.36]It's probably gonna be something like Sudoku math problem, right?
[175:55.60]That puzzle was fucking easy.
[175:59.00]That puzzle was just a free gift.
[176:07.13]Go to this door.
[176:10.53]It just opens.
[176:18.38]I got the key.
[176:20.32]I got the key, man.
[176:29.04]Oh shit.
[176:41.15]Lots of levers here.
[176:42.29]Maybe I should have done that.
[176:54.76]Where's Obi-Wan Kenobi here?
[177:00.87]An old man I've not seen before approached me after Evan's song.
[177:04.48]He knew the legend of this chapel and the relic hidden somewhere within these stone walls.
[177:08.60]He gave me a small box that it contained something that would help me, something which would unlock the truth.
[177:13.08]The well.
[177:21.46]Wait, wait, wait.
[177:21.84]I think we just saw those, didn't we?
[177:24.26]Yep.
[177:24.40]Alright.
[177:26.22]N...
[177:30.83]Boss W thing.
[177:36.80]Boss E thing.
[177:42.70]What?
[177:46.97]Zoomer's Molding.
[177:51.97]Why do we have Zoomer's Molding?
[177:59.16]Alright, well, something obviously goes in there.
[178:00.40]I don't know what.
[178:05.42]Goes in here, obviously.
[178:06.32]I don't know what.
[178:10.30]There's tons of places to go up here.
[178:12.88]Miles, the Templars carried the cargo.
[178:14.66]At the hour before midnight, the attack began.
[178:17.40]That's a clock.
[178:21.63]How do I change the clock?
[178:30.66]There's a lot of space here.
[178:32.10]That's the plate for the well, right?
[178:51.19]Mirror fragments set in stone.
[178:53.69]Alright, whatever.
[178:55.05]It's a process, right?
[178:56.13]Look at these books.
[179:09.88]Wait.
[179:10.08]Put the night vision on.
[179:13.02]Make sure there's nothing in here.
[179:19.86]I got the well.
[179:20.90]I'm good to go.
[179:25.77]That go in here.
[179:39.62]Place to go behind me.
[179:49.72]I mean, absolutely no disrespect.
[179:51.96]I mean, no disrespect in here, okay?
[179:54.15]I just, I say that all the time.
[179:56.51]I say that all the time.
[179:58.89]I'm sorry.

[180:15.48]Otto is gone.
[180:16.38]Not in virtual reality.
[180:21.41]He's right over here.
[180:25.03]We're concerned.
[180:27.61]He's right there.
[180:28.23]He's okay.
[180:30.99]He's just chilling over there.
[180:31.89]He's lined up.
[180:34.76]Man out the window.
[180:39.34]Okay, let's go.

[181:08.82]What do I do with the bowl?
[181:09.81]Can I get in here?
[181:15.35]I'm not going to tease Otto's way over there.

[223:08.80]I'm gonna get, like, a bunch of fucking hair, like, just, like, a wig and cut a bunch of hair out of the wig at the Halloween store and, like, get it in here and, like, have it be coming out and shit on stream.
[223:21.88]I don't know what this even means, but apparently it's under one of these banners.
[223:28.98]I don't know what that... Okay, now that's important.
[223:38.11]Okay, green, blue... Somebody will get a good screenshot.
[223:41.59]It's the upside down.
[223:42.38]Okay, I know what to do.
[223:43.46]Let's go.
[223:45.50]Banner that would fall, whatever.
[223:49.06]That was important.
[223:59.46]Although we don't have a disk or anything over there.
[224:00.96]There's no disk.
[224:02.10]Pug pug.
[224:04.82]I've slept through the full stream and this is going to put me to sleep again.
[224:16.19]Cog goes where?
[224:17.97]Nice.
[224:24.91]I have a huge indent on my face.
[224:26.51]It hurts.
[224:30.00]Okay.
[224:30.46]Taurus at 10 o'clock.
[224:33.00]It did fall.
[224:36.66]And 10 o'clock to save us all or something.
[224:42.53]Whatever.
[224:42.85]No, it was 11 o'clock.
[224:52.89]And it was a full moon.
[224:56.58]full moon taurus at 10. oh I got it what does that do man
[225:39.75]Get a close up view of this.
[225:42.13]That's okay.
[225:47.89]Oh, where that goes.
[225:51.70]Oh, auto check auto.
[226:03.12]Right.
[226:09.91]the other one that's not gonna bounce I need to bounce off that one but I don't have that one I get that one oh the piano right the organ we're gonna do the organ
[226:41.05]Oh, okay.
[226:41.35]Here we go.
[226:45.93]Oh, my face.
[226:46.45]Why is it so dark in here?
[226:50.79]Hold on.
[226:51.21]It's dark as hell in here.
[226:52.15]You guys get out.
[226:56.35]I'm just a silhouette in the room.
[227:10.83]Good.
[227:12.12]Better.
[227:19.89]Don't worry, frankly, wait.
[227:21.23]I'll answer the question.
[227:23.01]Wait, wait, wait.
[227:24.05]What does it say?
[227:25.45]It says, Jeremiah, frankly, I find your avoidance of an answer to the question of slugpogging is problematic.
[227:30.40]I've been an avid viewer of the channel for 15 years, and as such, I can clearly see the great value slugpog has brought to this channel.
[227:36.08]Please don't kill the slugpog.
[227:37.28]It holds us together.
[227:37.98]It's a sticky slug slime.
[227:39.30]It's being removed at the end of the stream.
[227:41.16]Like, I'm just going to get rid of it.
[227:42.14]It's ugly, and it annoys everybody.
[227:45.98]It's being removed in about 30 to 40 minutes.
[227:51.75]Or is it?
[227:52.11]Stay tuned to find out.
[227:56.07]Or is it?
[227:58.11]Find out.
[228:09.30]I'm so scared to take this headband off.
[228:13.56]I really am.
[228:16.56]I'm scared that I'm going to take this off and there's not going to be anything underneath here.
[228:53.50]You know in the movie where the guy puts his hand on the ball in the class?
[228:59.84]In the science class?
[229:00.72]That's not even a movie.
[229:04.19]It's just in class.
[229:07.07]That's not coming back for a while.
[229:09.75]I'm in a lot of trouble now.
[229:20.09]Oh.
[229:21.55]My.
[229:23.41]Fucking.
[229:24.25]God.
[229:24.83]Oh.
[229:26.60]So he said Rayman.
[229:53.00]It looks like it hurts.
[229:54.46]And it does.
[229:55.22]Trust me when I say it fucking hurts.
[229:57.10]You can't do VR.
[229:58.36]It's not possible.
[229:59.40]This is why it's never gonna take off.
[230:01.69]1.8% of people on Steam have VR.
[230:05.75]You want this to happen to you?
[230:07.89]No, you don't.
[230:08.77]You don't want to look like this.
[230:11.93]You don't want to, like, lose the top fucking part of your hair?
[230:24.38]You're using the five-year-old outdated- I can't even take myself seriously.
[230:33.79]You can see the scalp!
[230:35.87]I've ruined my fucking head!
[230:37.63]This is gonna take years for this to come back normally!
[230:41.04]This is gonna take a decade for the- and by a decade, by the way, I'll be 45 and it'll just be gone anyways!
[230:53.90]Brush it?
[230:54.42]No!
[230:55.50]I'm not brushing it.
[230:59.06]I'm not brushing- I'm gonna go in the bath and I'm gonna hold my head under water and put conditioner in my hair.
[231:08.90]This is a chaotic stream.
[231:12.67]Okay, okay, ready?
[231:13.39]Alright, would you- Would you swipe right?
[231:32.18]That's, okay, that's the, this, this is the guy that you accidentally super like.
[231:38.10]And you go, oh, fuck.
[231:44.57]Oh, you super liked me?
[231:46.77]What was it?
[231:48.33]You like me a lot, apparently.
[231:50.73]You like to go on a date?
[232:01.52]No, Rayman.
[232:02.42]Rayman was the best.
[232:03.54]Rayman is the best description.
[232:05.28]Wow.
[232:05.86]I really like this view.
[232:10.40]I feel pretty confident right now.
[232:12.26]Hey.
[232:13.46]Remember me?
[232:14.06]Jerma985.
[232:15.58]Good to meet you.
[232:17.00]That's me.
[232:17.90]Welcome to the stream.
[232:18.88]I'm pretty handsome.
[232:20.44]I'm a pretty handsome guy.
[232:22.02]Don't you think?
[232:27.30]I made it worse.
[232:32.42]It's dead.
[232:33.52]It's actually all dead hair.
[232:35.04]It's a bird's nest.
[232:38.90]Let the light hit it.
[232:44.20]Somebody fucking electrocuted me.
[232:49.12]Take the shirt off.
[232:50.34]Like, that'll help.
[232:55.64]I don't even want to touch it.
[232:56.66]It's gonna all fall off.
[233:07.83]Imagine if I actually pulled a clump.
[233:17.86]Upside down?
[233:18.64]Hey, show feet.
[233:22.78]Is that really what you're asking right now?
[233:25.50]After this?
[233:26.08]This is, that's what you're asking.
[233:40.64]I gotta cut it all off.
[233:52.09]And VR.
[233:52.65]Alright, let's get in here and do the organ.
[233:57.21]You're gonna do the Costanza?
[234:04.84]I thought the headband was gonna help.
[234:08.52]Headband might have actually made it worse.
[234:18.61]Calm down, your hair is fine.
[234:19.77]Let's go.
[234:40.62]Hey.
[234:43.80]Where the heck am I?
[234:46.94]Where the heck am I?
[234:47.86]I can't see anything.
[234:48.90]Whoa, this is fucking really immersive.
[234:51.62]Oh, nope.
[234:53.04]I hit the fucking thing.
[234:54.42]That didn't even work.
[234:55.30]I was trying to... Are those glued to the wall?
[234:59.36]Okay.
[235:12.75]It's been baby-proofed.
[235:16.42]What the hell were we doing before I panicked about my appearance?
[235:19.66]Like how my hair is gone?
[235:22.30]I'm going to leave conditioner in my hair.
[235:24.20]I'm going to play Half-Life Alyx tomorrow.
[235:28.02]Lucky if there's anything left.
[235:41.38]Bald, bald, wear a wig.
[235:44.09]Why not try a beanie?
[235:45.21]I tried a beanie before and my head was sweating so much that I got zits all over my forehead.
[235:51.51]And all over my face.
[235:52.45]I had zits in my hair.
[235:56.17]I remember being like, ow, fucking zits!
[236:00.98]VR sucks, okay?
[236:08.94]It's just do a cool thing and torture yourself.
[236:18.09]VR fucking sucks.
[236:21.99]It's so cool.
[236:23.37]It's so much fun.
[236:25.75]But holy shit, you lose like three months of your life every time you play it.
[236:31.57]Alright, let's do this.
[236:33.11]Up the stairs, right?
[236:33.91]Yeah.
[236:38.74]How do we get back up there?
[236:39.42]I don't remember.
[236:43.06]Anybody remember?
[236:50.71]Okay.
[236:53.29]Popper?
[236:54.24]Thank you.
[236:54.58]Popper?
[236:56.98]Thank you.
[237:00.72]Oh.
[237:19.22]Oh, nice.
[237:33.85]Oh.
[237:36.57]Oh, shit.
[237:37.21]I think it is.
[237:49.43]What the heck?
[237:50.69]Cool.
[238:00.36]How do I get over there?
[238:09.18]Vice is over there.
[238:09.76]How do I get over there?
[238:18.89]Okay, um, should I get out?
[238:22.49]Bro, what the heck?
[238:27.73]I don't know what I just did.
[238:29.18]Fuck.
[238:52.16]Wait a minute.
[238:52.46]What the hell did I just do?
[238:58.89]What is this doing?
[239:04.39]Whoa.
[239:10.24]What is going on over there?
[239:25.86]Rat.
[239:26.37]Rat with a hat?
[239:30.99]What are you talking about?
[239:34.35]Rat Pog.
[239:35.03]Rat Pog.
[239:41.80]Do all of them just face the same direction like that?
[239:44.82]Yeah, do they just face the same way?
[239:48.10]There's a rat in the hat.
[240:02.78]Do you not see the rat in the hat?
[240:04.12]I do.
[240:08.06]What are you guys talking about?
[240:14.90]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[240:15.68]Hold on.

[240:35.64]I don't know.
[240:49.43]I don't know.
[240:50.91]I don't know.
[240:52.25]Right behind you, there's a little rat with a hat on.
[240:59.47]I think Xanax feels like...
[241:06.95]The game audio is muted?
[241:08.32]No, it's not.
[241:09.58]Wait, like that?
[241:16.36]That's not right.
[241:19.40]This is not right, and I'm not happy about it.
[241:21.63]I don't know.
[241:25.25]We're going back in.
[241:56.62]Holy shit.
[241:57.38]Okay, cool.
[241:57.88]I got it.
[241:58.42]I figured it out.
[241:58.96]No, I didn't.
[241:59.90]Fuck.
[242:00.26]It's gotta be a shorter one.
[242:02.18]Okay.
[242:02.50]It's gotta be a short one.
[242:04.68]This one is correct.
[242:05.76]Kind of.
[242:07.96]Oh, it's this.
[242:08.62]Whatever one is right here.
[242:09.70]That's correct.
[242:10.36]But that one isn't.
[242:11.64]It's gotta be this one there.
[242:12.70]Let's go.
[242:19.14]Oh, that's correct.
[242:23.56]Another one of those.
[242:25.46]That one right here.
[242:29.12]Put that one right there.
[242:30.73]How about that one?
[242:33.01]Folks, how about that one folks?
[242:42.79]Oh, that was wrong.
[243:13.02]Poor hair.

[243:18.60]Why is this?

[244:40.52]Wait, is that not it?
[244:43.70]Fuck.
[245:09.17]Open it!
[245:09.57]Spin them back around.
[245:14.40]Yeah, I can't.
[245:16.20]I can't touch the wheel.
[245:19.54]Walked in place.
[245:27.12]It's probably just one of these weird ones here.
[245:29.60]I got an idea.
[245:37.36]I do.
[245:41.04]That one.
[245:43.40]That one.

[259:49.65]It's a series of puzzle boxes, one of the most fun iPad games that they ported to Steam.
[259:55.97]I know you know that.

[260:14.94]Does it have like a price tag on it?
[260:16.00]That was tricky.
[260:35.76]They paid $50, but it's worth $40.
[260:37.67]Okay, so how's this wrong?
[260:42.75]That looks correct.
[260:45.84]Am I shining at the wrong person?
[260:50.00]That looks right to me.
[261:04.27]What's the deal?
[261:04.79]I just did that.

[278:20.34]What is a game- What does that mean?
[278:25.96]I really, dude, I'm losing my mind.
[278:28.70]I really thought that my penis came out on stream today, and I freaked out about it.
[278:39.25]That's completely impossible.
[278:42.31]I have no idea why I thought that.
[278:49.18]But it did.

[279:16.06]What do I do?
[279:16.48]I'm gonna have to, like, put oil on my- I'm gonna have to oil my hair back.
[279:19.66]I think that's what's gonna happen.
[279:23.70]I'm gonna put, like, just oil in my hair so it slicks all the way back so that it does not touch the coconut oil.
[279:29.95]Yeah.
[279:35.25]Don't use a headband.
[279:36.81]A swimming cap.
[279:38.88]Use olive oil.
[279:40.58]I'm gonna put oil all over my head tomorrow.
[279:42.88]That's the only way this is gonna help.
[279:51.33]Thanks for watching, guys.
