[00:00.29]Shadow Warrior, put your mixer to zero, it's extremely loud.
[00:04.33]Oh, I already killed some people.
[00:06.46]Oh, you already did it, okay.
[00:07.82]So yeah, I lost the game because Overwatch broke, and then I turned this game on and killed everyone.
[00:13.02]It was a... It was a rough couple of moments there.
[00:17.25]Okay.
[00:18.21]And then I had the rant about why do games still do this.
[00:22.79]Why don't games start at 20 or 30?
[00:24.95]It is every single PC game.
[00:27.37]Every single one.
[00:27.85]There's maybe one exception out there that, like, realized, eh, maybe the defaults are kind of loud.
[00:35.89]Yeah.
[00:37.43]It is too loud.
[00:39.07]Always too loud.
[00:44.50]You know when you start up a game and, like, the first thing it asks you is, like, it checks your brightness to do a slider?
[00:51.38]Actually, they don't even do that anymore.
[00:54.21]Some of them do.
[00:54.73]That's what I'm saying.
[00:56.49]Doom actually did.
[00:57.19]That's what I was thinking.
[00:58.25]That's a pretty new game.
[00:59.15]But they should do that with a volume slider.
[01:01.75]It should start at zero and be like, pick your volume, dumbass.
[01:06.61]Yeah, that is true.
[01:07.67]If they're going to give you gamma or, hey, test your video card, it should also be, hey, what volume do you want the game to start at?
[01:16.40]I agree with you.
[01:17.26]I agree with you.
[01:18.02]I agree with you.
[01:18.89]I'm just asking for a little bit of innovation.
[01:20.41]I agree with you.
[01:21.45]I'm just asking for a little bit of innovation.
[01:26.48]Just a little bit of innovation.
[01:27.80]Just a little bit.
[01:30.18]Not much, just a little bit.
[01:32.60]I've streamed this main menu for like 15 minutes.
[01:35.92]Why?
[01:36.22]I told you I was going to be... My stream's at 7.
[01:41.87]Kind of funny to me.
[01:42.89]I'm just going to sit here for 15 to 20 minutes streaming a menu screen.
[01:48.01]I got fucked by Overwatch.
[01:50.13]Well, you should open up, like, fuckin' Barnyard Blitz or whatever the hell, like, little Facebook pages.
[01:55.24]Well, I had to open up this game, make sure I had it set up for the stream, change my key bindings, make sure I killed everyone with the audio.
[02:03.20]And I don't know, I just... I don't feel like doing anything after I got fisted by Jeff Kaplan.
[02:10.48]Oh my god, excuse me.
[02:12.74]PG-16 stream.
[02:16.77]It happened to a lot of people, too.
[02:17.79]He had his hands up in everyone's ass.
[02:19.45]Oh my god.
[02:21.86]Man, he said blame me for everything.
[02:25.08]Wow.
[02:26.64]Alright, well, we just go live and Star's talking about reaching into people's assholes.
[02:30.44]That's okay.
[02:31.14]Great.
[02:32.78]No problem.
[02:33.20]Starting soon.
[02:34.75]Did you make a new starting soon screen?
[02:37.07]Yeah, look at it.
[02:39.19]Look at it.
[02:39.59]It's cinematic.
[02:41.73]It's like my indie film.
[02:52.23]Would you be mad if I restreamed your stream on my stream?
[02:55.09]That is a bad starting soon screen.
[02:57.25]It's cinematic.
[02:58.07]It's like, here we go.
[02:58.87]Like, here comes the independent film festival film.
[03:02.51]That's bad.
[03:03.48]Even if it was, that should be on the bottom right, not the bottom left.
[03:06.22]No, look, I don't even care.
[03:07.46]Starting soon screens are dumb.
[03:08.82]You know why?
[03:09.28]Because it's only going to be on for like two seconds before you go like this.
[03:14.18]Hey, what's happening, guys?
[03:15.42]Welcome.
[03:15.72]We're back here.
[03:16.40]Welcome to the stream.
[03:18.43]Well, usually when I start, like, a single-player experience, or, like, when I get some... I wait for people to join before I, like, just get going, because what if they miss the first cutscene?
[03:26.25]So I... I mean, starting soon screens have... they're useful.
[03:31.83]Yeah, well, I usually have my starting... I'm reading some funny things people are writing in my chat room.
[03:40.02]Say their names for me real quick.
[03:41.94]No, you're gonna be... I'm gonna have to really mute, because you don't like it when I, like, thank people.
[03:48.07]You should just tell them all that they're worthless.
[03:51.71]No.
[03:53.63]That's a you thing.
[03:55.41]It's not a me thing.
[03:57.79]Some people like that.
[04:00.05]Well, some people like that, I guess.
[04:03.41]Alright, how do we do this?
[04:04.25]How do we play?
[04:05.77]I don't know.
[04:06.13]There's a giant multiplayer button.
[04:09.03]Thank you, wasting time and space.
[04:11.37]Funky Tunk.
[04:12.45]Phantom Trout.
[04:14.91]We gotta do this fucking prologue mission?
[04:18.42]So let me get that name right.
[04:20.00]It's not Zelda.
[04:22.66]Then we get some bits.
[04:23.44]We got Joel's Skype password.
[04:25.82]George McKay.
[04:27.06]Stop saying names.
[04:28.56]What are you talking about?
[04:29.56]We gotta do a prologue mission before we can play with each other.
[04:33.04]You know how games do that?
[04:33.96]Can we have a little bit of innovation and have games stop doing that?
[04:38.58]Alright, so I have to do a new game then.
[04:40.34]Slot 1, new character.
[04:41.88]Yeah, new character.
[04:43.78]Uh...
[04:48.15]Thank you everybody that's subscribing right now.
[04:50.29]He's not going to let me do this.
[04:52.79]He's a fucking punk.
[04:54.67]Thank you everybody that just subbed.
[04:57.11]It was a lot.
[04:58.09]Thank you Mountain Blade.
[04:59.48]I'm not Star's fan.
[05:00.66]Meme Machine.
[05:01.82]86631.
[05:02.98]There was a couple people before that I think I might have missed.
[05:07.28]What's the loot?
[05:08.08]Killer Crocomire, LocoRoco, Zuzazkaz, Deesun, FunToTheMax, and ShadowWire.
[05:16.51]Hold on.
[05:18.02]Yeah?
[05:19.46]What difficulty are you doing?
[05:21.00]I don't know.
[05:21.60]What do you want to do?
[05:22.52]Two-player, three-player, four-player difficulty?
[05:25.33]No, you pick single player to do the prologue, but then it asks you the difficulty.
[05:30.45]And I'm suggesting who wants Wang.
[05:33.82]Wait, what?
[05:34.90]I mean, who wants Wang?
[05:36.06]You're not listening to me!
[05:38.44]You still have single player!
[05:39.98]I did.
[05:43.08]Then click new go.
[05:46.66]So we have to do single player only.
[05:50.27]Let's just do the prologue in single player, because we have to do it in single player.
[05:54.73]God!
[05:55.69]Oh my god.
[05:56.41]Alright, select character.
[05:57.85]Do you know what kind of ass this guy is?
[05:59.95]Alright, okay.
[06:00.79]And now, which one?
[06:03.01]Look, I just... I don't care.
[06:05.49]You play what you want to play.
[06:06.57]I'm being the tiny grasshopper.
[06:08.21]Oh my fucking god.
[06:09.81]No, no.
[06:15.47]Don't do tiny grasshopper.
[06:16.92]Do not do tiny grasshopper.
[06:19.88]We'll just do Wang.
[06:20.73]It looks hard.
[06:21.95]Are you ready for a hard game?
[06:24.13]Dude, hard's easy.
[06:26.83]Do you really want to do this?
[06:29.67]Better loot, though.
[06:30.53]There's better loot to find.
[06:31.90]There's better loot.
[06:32.92]Alright, I'm doing who wants Wang.
[06:36.00]Now I feel like my game's too quiet.
[06:37.46]Before, it killed people.
[06:38.60]Now...
[06:39.92]Alright, well, we both have cutscenes to watch, so shut your mouth.
[06:44.48]No, I skipped it.
[06:45.68]You skipped it.
[06:46.18]I skipped it.
[06:47.42]Weren't you the one just complaining about needing to start soon?
[06:50.03]Who hasn't seen the opening cutscene?
[06:51.39]Isn't that what you were just talking about?
[06:53.91]This game... The main character... I hate it.
[07:02.90]I hate this whole game.
[07:04.66]What?
[07:05.80]What's wrong with you?
[07:07.28]Oh, you gotta change your field of view.
[07:09.20]I already did that.
[07:10.66]I forgot.
[07:11.52]I'm gonna go with a hipster 96.
[07:13.20]Alright.
[07:16.35]I'm just gonna skip it.
[07:17.45]I'm sorry, guys.
[07:18.59]Did Baller Digital have something to do with this?
[07:20.83]Did they, like, make this game?
[07:24.21]They're everywhere.
[07:24.75]Because they published it?
[07:26.77]Dude, you wanted to skip this weird, cool opening cutscene that has copyrighted music, so yeah, we're gonna skip it.
[07:33.27]Alright, basic movement.
[07:34.61]W... W-A.
[07:37.37]W-A-S.
[07:37.77]W-W-W.
[07:38.87]Basic... W-A-S-D.
[07:39.97]Okay, got it.
[07:42.50]I have... How do I... How do I... Advanced options in the options.
[07:48.92]Huh?
[07:50.54]You go in the options, and, like, the advanced options are unclickable.
[07:55.68]Cut.
[07:56.08]God damn it.
[07:56.88]Can we just have a little bit of innovation?
[07:58.44]Did you say... What?
[07:59.96]What?
[08:01.44]You say, oh, cut.
[08:02.58]Oh, cut.
[08:03.16]Cut it.
[08:03.50]We'll stop the stream.
[08:04.80]We're gonna do it again.
[08:05.38]I really should at this point.
[08:12.01]That's probably what was killing me is the film grain.
[08:14.23]So is only vertical FOV allowed?
[08:15.71]I don't know.
[08:18.48]I didn't make this game.
[08:20.78]Ask Devolver Digital.
[08:22.86]Turn everything off.
[08:25.62]Okay, we got a lot of weapon selection.
[08:28.08]Or up and down on the mouse.
[08:29.12]Okay, you can pull out your... Oh, wow.
[08:31.24]We got guns and stuff?
[08:33.42]Select the last ranged weapon.
[08:34.86]Is that... G is melee.
[08:36.76]Gonna change that.
[08:38.32]Oh, god.
[08:38.84]That wasn't the... It wasn't there long enough for me to see the last thing.
[08:44.88]That's a lot of... That is a lot of stuff.
[08:47.42]Gotta find and steal the mysterious item for the Yakuza.
[08:50.54]Alright.
[08:51.34]Where the fuck is this thing?
[08:56.54]Where the fuck is this thing?
[08:59.14]I don't like this guy.
[09:00.00]Don't encourage him.
[09:02.68]The game is just really low.
[09:10.31]Is everyone in your chat complaining too?
[09:12.05]Or is that just mine?
[09:13.45]No, we're just hanging out, man.
[09:14.79]I'm doing the tutorial mission.
[09:18.98]This is a dash too.
[09:20.98]I know!
[09:23.55]Look, just because you had, like, a bad day doesn't mean you have to, like, ruin everybody else's day.
[09:27.83]Oh, wow.
[09:31.70]I didn't have a comeback.
[09:32.68]I thought I did, and I thought about it.
[09:33.98]It wasn't very good.
[09:35.18]Did you get, like, a puke sensation from this game?
[09:43.78]Puke sensation?
[09:45.10]Did you make your field of view high enough?
[09:46.46]Did you lower your graphics?
[09:47.63]Yeah.
[09:48.17]I'm feeling fine.
[09:49.27]I'm getting, like, a very serious puke sensation here.
[09:51.82]You might have a low field of view or like some... I'm at 100 vertical field of view.
[09:57.37]You might have like a motion blur on or a... I turned off blur.
[10:00.61]Let's turn off the lens flare.
[10:02.73]There's a film grain on that might be killing you.
[10:04.63]Chromatic aberration will do that.
[10:08.06]Okay, PC gaming.
[10:09.80]Don't you just love PC gamers?
[10:11.58]Yeah, turn off like the graphics.
[10:12.66]Turn off the cool graphic lens flare.
[10:14.40]Depth of field, get that out of here.
[10:15.44]Film grain, blue.
[10:16.06]No, get that out of here.
[10:17.64]You know, put this down to like medium.
[10:19.65]I think my stream is actually, even with the lower graphics, my stream is not staying at consistent FPS.
[10:30.02]That feels a little better.
[10:35.92]Yeah, that's better.
[10:38.54]Thanks a lot, all the new subs.
[10:39.73]We've got some 12-monthers to say hello to.
[10:41.93]We've got Mr. Kool-Aid for 12 months.
[10:44.65]Thanks for the years of laughter.
[10:45.67]Thanks, Mr. Kool-Aid.
[10:46.49]You've been here for a long time.
[10:48.41]Laddie596 for 12 months.
[10:49.92]Mr. Champ for 8 months.
[10:52.70]BoneMonger for 7 months.
[10:53.92]Even at 100 field of view, actually, it feels... It's like I hold a cell phone stick.
[10:59.45]Thanks a lot, Ramirez, for 5 months.
[11:02.83]And Corporal Small, thank you for your new subscription.
[11:05.34]And Wardy Fingleblaster for seven months.
[11:07.88]If he eats ass, I'm asking for a friend.
[11:10.28]And you can thank Ragglefrack and Croucher as well, because they were here for seven months too.
[11:14.04]That's 777.
[11:15.58]And there's ten months.
[11:17.90]Hope you used my money to buy some burgers.
[11:19.68]I probably did.
[11:20.24]I killed the rats in the tutorial mission.
[11:22.66]But thank you guys, and thank you Gavikmal and Vandal.
[11:25.32]I gotta do one more thing.
[11:26.56]Both of you guys.
[11:27.12]Sorry.
[11:30.22]No fall damage, that's good to know.
[11:33.47]Okay, definitely gotta get my sensitivity up here.
[11:38.33]It's the giant model.
[11:43.29]Sting, melee up and... Not even that big.
[11:47.14]Okay, up and... God, that's gotta stay up there for more than three seconds.
[11:53.64]Some kind of tutorial this is.
[11:55.40]All the things are on there for three seconds.
[11:59.42]Are you walking forward through them?
[12:02.14]No.
[12:03.70]It's like, here, here's a bunch of elaborate sword moves.
[12:06.26]Uh, it's off the screen now.
[12:08.20]I didn't even notice it, so... Oh my god, hot diggity dog, we've got hot diggity dog, we've got 5,000 bits from Wager.
[12:15.57]Wager, hot dog, thank you for the 5,000, dude.
[12:18.45]That's a lot of money.
[12:21.43]Much appreciated, man.
[12:23.33]Wait, what did that say?
[12:25.41]What?
[12:26.73]I just walked by something and it told me, hey, you have cheated, it's gone.
[12:29.76]That's what I'm talking about.
[12:30.76]That's what I'm saying.
[12:31.38]Okay, Chi Shrine.
[12:33.54]Oh, we're gone.
[12:34.72]Chi Shrine.
[12:35.60]Whatever the fuck this does.
[12:37.50]Can I, like, talk to... Jesus.
[12:41.06]I'm gonna walk really slowly.
[12:42.04]Healing Flame Power.
[12:42.94]Press Q to regenerate some of your health.
[12:45.18]Hold Q. Oh, you can use the Healing Flame.
[12:48.02]This one stayed on a lot longer than the last one did.
[12:51.58]Keep... Okay, hold Q. It's gone.
[12:57.96]Emo Shrines.
[12:58.58]Oh, and it's fucking gone!
[13:01.68]I guess that's pretty self-explanatory.
[13:04.38]Yeah, I'm crotch-walking everywhere, so I don't miss anything.
[13:08.50]I think it really is only vertical FOV.
[13:14.93]Okay, for one second I was like, where's Star?
[13:18.29]Where's he not in my game?
[13:22.81]Oh, I wanted to do this, though.
[13:24.15]Game and HUD.
[13:26.65]That is pretty self-explanatory.
[13:28.59]Yeah.
[13:32.37]I'm gonna do uh show crosshair this field of view feels it feels weird like whenever I look up at a shrine I feel like it's like a fisheye kind of thing and it's still a fisheye I'm turning my down to like 92 or something I feel like it's weird like that sensitivity needs to go up
[14:01.78]Yeah, I'm telling you, turn it down to like 92.
[14:03.90]Or like 90.
[14:05.90]It feels a lot less like your face is being squished by a vice when you deal with 90.
[14:12.13]I'm sucking dicks.
[14:13.23]Hold on.
[14:14.59]What the hell does that mean?
[14:17.03]What?
[14:20.04]Yeah, I'm gonna go through and catch the new subs.
[14:22.42]Don't worry, guys.
[14:23.76]Don't worry, I know you exist.
[14:24.90]Don't worry.
[14:25.50]That's a bomb!
[14:26.26]That's a bomb!
[14:28.04]Don't worry, guys.
[14:28.52]I know that you exist.
[14:29.40]I can see it.
[14:29.98]I promise to say thank you.
[14:31.32]I will.
[14:32.77]I love all of you.
[14:40.25]There's Harry.
[14:41.43]And speaking of people that I love, thank you Potato for your subscription.
[14:45.28]Thank you Meow-tastic Streams, Varaxy Muramasa.
[14:49.14]Dude, this guy is saying bad words.
[14:50.18]Anal Goblin, again.
[14:51.86]Are you prepared that there will be bad words said?
[14:55.52]I say bad words.
[14:59.50]Alright, let's do it.
[15:01.88]I'm going to do the sting move.
[15:03.06]That's going to be my go-to, is the sting.
[15:09.05]Dude, also my volume just feels so weird.
[15:14.79]Parry.
[15:17.17]I gotta be careful with this guy.
[15:18.49]He's doing the World of Warcraft dragon move.
[15:22.90]All the dragons do it.
[15:23.78]They spit like that.
[15:24.66]That move.
[15:25.64]Every dragon in World of Warcraft does that move.
[15:27.38]You gotta be careful about it.
[15:34.98]You gotta be careful.
[15:36.18]What the hell is he doing?
[15:38.85]Oh shit, he brought in a bunch more hammerhead shocks.
[15:41.69]I'm gonna die.
[15:44.39]Remember what they taught you about your chi.
[15:46.69]Oh yeah, my chi.
[15:49.74]I don't know why I turned the voice volume up, because this guy's already... Like, I get enough of this, like, 12-year-old comedy from Overwatch people.
[16:01.94]You know what I'm saying?
[16:03.28]I don't know what you're saying.
[16:04.06]I'm currently trying not to lose in the tutorial.
[16:13.63]Currently trying to not die in the tutorial mission.
[16:18.99]We done?
[16:19.61]Yeah.
[16:24.33]Yeah.
[16:26.30]Oh, damn it!
[16:27.20]Oh, dude, come on!
[16:28.28]Oh, I'm dead.
[16:40.64]Oh boy, this is awful.
[16:41.76]Let me turn this up so you guys can hear how awful this is.
[16:52.68]He just sang to me.
[16:57.02]It's a rare form of comedy called I Hope You're Nine Years Old.
[17:03.88]I'll be right back.
[17:06.08]Mr. Applesauce!
[17:09.17]10,000 bits.
[17:09.97]Is Sherman getting $10,000 right now?
[17:11.53]Are you fucking serious, dude?
[17:12.73]Has he streamed for 10 minutes?
[17:15.13]That's unbelievable.
[17:16.13]Thank you for the 100 bucks.
[17:17.65]That's already, like, so... And then 1,000 bits, again, from Mr. Applesauce.
[17:23.01]110.
[17:23.83]Fucking Jesus, man.
[17:26.33]Thanks.
[17:27.09]And before that, he did 100.
[17:28.33]That's... You're too kind, man.
[17:34.68]You guys are generous, generous dudes.
[17:38.82]And then OxyCray with the subscription.
[17:40.55]And then... For 12 months, dude.
[17:43.77]One full year.
[17:44.71]Thanks a lot, man.
[17:45.59]All the proud Jerma people who will be willing to fight, say yeah.
[17:48.75]Yeah.
[17:50.97]Well, dude, that's very, very, very kind of all of you guys.
[17:55.02]I can't believe it.
[17:56.16]We've been streaming for like 20 minutes.
[17:59.42]Much love to all you guys.
[18:00.98]Much love, much respect.
[18:02.44]Hope you enjoy the show tonight.
[18:04.19]It should be a good one.
[18:08.62]If I've known anything about gas canisters... Wait, the ladders?
[18:14.31]I don't know what to do about a ladder.
[18:15.93]What do you do about a ladder?
[18:19.77]Is it alive?
[18:20.23]It's going to grow arms and start fighting.
[18:22.33]I think it is.
[18:24.06]I've seen this before.
[18:24.74]Wait, what?
[18:24.94]Did he just say... Hello, my friend.
[18:26.50]Ready to kill some fuckfaces?
[18:36.84]Ready to kill some fuck-faces?
[18:39.38]He did not just say that, did he?
[18:41.56]Ready to kill some fuck-faces.
[18:44.05]He did say it.
[18:44.81]I'm assuming that's a checkpoint.
[18:50.01]My graphics are so low, oh my god.
[18:52.35]You can see them popping on the enemies and everything.
[18:58.72]Actually, sprinting makes me kind of sick.
[19:01.47]Sprinting?
[19:04.35]There's a sprint?
[19:07.99]Yeah, tap W. But it kind of makes me want to throw up, so I don't do it.
[19:15.94]Okay, I don't know what I did.
[19:18.82]Enemies will often drop gems that can improve your weapons, armor, and powers.
[19:21.96]Press I and select upgrades.
[19:25.02]Oh boy, there's a lot of stuff going on here.
[19:26.72]Yeah.
[19:30.58]I didn't even get that tutorial.
[19:31.92]I don't think you're ahead of me.
[19:34.58]Drama confirmed for nine years old.
[19:36.02]Yep.
[19:36.32]Can't even click on nine years old?
[19:37.60]What the hell are you talking about?
[19:39.06]You laughed at it.
[19:40.68]You said fuck faces.
[19:42.29]I laughed at it because it's just like, why is it, why?
[19:47.95]Skills.
[19:53.31]Weapons.
[19:53.87]You can like upgrade the weapon too, that's cool.
[19:57.19]Insert or select gem.
[19:58.94]Oh, I didn't kill the spooters.
[20:04.12]The Wanglopedia.
[20:06.70]Is it really called the Wanglopedia?
[20:09.44]Okay, hold on.
[20:10.06]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[20:10.96]Hold on.
[20:11.22]You were making fun of me laughing at something in the game.
[20:12.80]You just laughed at Wanglopedia.
[20:15.32]Okay, I... You are also nine years old.
[20:17.96]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[20:19.98]What do you mean, no?
[20:21.80]I mean, I accept that you said you laughed at it because why?
[20:24.86]I'm laughing the same reason.
[20:25.98]Why would you call it the Wanglopedia?
[20:28.33]It's just... Listen.
[20:34.20]Is this the end of the tutorial?
[20:37.10]Am I ahead of you?
[20:38.06]I can't be ahead of you right now.
[20:41.91]What do you mean?
[20:43.07]I'm at the shrine with guys.
[20:46.49]I just got my first upgrade.
[20:50.81]Did you get your upgrade yet?
[20:52.41]What upgrade?
[20:53.25]You got a way to go, buddy.
[20:55.51]I didn't kill those spiders, people were telling me.
[20:58.72]I did.
[21:00.46]Yeah, and I skipped, I ran past, that's why I'm definitely further than you.
[21:03.88]Well, how have you not gotten your first, like, gem upgrade, then?
[21:06.40]Because I didn't kill the spiders and they drop it!
[21:08.39]It wasn't... God, dude, you needed to do the tutorial.
[21:11.57]There's more spiders to kill.
[21:12.87]Just want to let you know, want to make sure you're aware of that.
[21:17.17]What the hell are those health bars?
[21:24.82]Ugh, dude, any- oh, mm.
[21:27.96]Okay.
[21:29.42]It's gonna do like the mirror edge rolls on me on top of already being kinda... Oh, boy.
[21:37.88]Increase your speed while falling, and land on the ground like a badass ninja.
[21:43.02]Okay.
[21:46.65]I thought I just fell off the back for a second.
[21:54.70]Alright, well that guy had a gas can on him.
[21:59.68]Where are you?
[22:02.22]Are we in different tutorials or something?
[22:04.28]Have you seen the giant golden snake yet?
[22:06.76]No.
[22:08.26]Have you seen the guy with the proton pack that you can blow up?
[22:11.76]No.
[22:11.94]I'm telling you, it's a different tutorial.
[22:16.44]It's a procedurally generated tutorial.
[22:18.70]I'm telling you, I ran through it so fast, you're probably just doing stuff I didn't look at.
[22:22.34]I don't... Okay, I'm getting into the car.
[22:24.50]Is there driving in this game?
[22:25.90]Please say yes.
[22:26.66]God damn it.
[22:27.68]No, this is still part of the tutorial.
[22:29.67]Once you get to the shrine.
[22:50.76]Thanks a lot, Twitchy Dove.
[22:52.64]Rex TTV.
[22:53.80]Twitchy Dove was seven months, by the way.

[23:24.36]Enemy.
[23:26.10]Watch out for the- you told me to watch out for the golden snake.
[23:27.82]Okay, is this game running at like 60 FPS or something?
[23:29.36]Uh, I don't know.
[23:32.76]Is it wise?
[23:33.12]You can't- are you having stream problems?
[23:39.70]Streaming issues?
[23:43.77]Uh, mine looks fine.
[23:46.67]Mine looks okay.
[23:51.45]Mamushi Heike may be a cold-blooded sociopathic mob boss, but she knows how to decorate.
[23:56.65]Alright.
[23:58.41]Let's go in here.
[24:01.00]I'm speaking with the lady.
[24:02.52]Oh, boy.

[24:04.30]Watch out for the mimes.
[24:06.40]Hello?
[24:07.58]Hello?
[24:08.78]Jesus, is this a party or was there a toxic spill?
[24:12.16]And there's Deadpool.
[24:12.81]I didn't know Deadpool was in this game.
[24:14.75]Fascinating.
[24:15.97]Oh, you'll get your chance.
[24:19.21]I see.
[24:21.77]I skipped it.
[24:25.71]I don't want to skip these.
[24:31.57]I got your trinket.
[24:32.54]Give me some cake.
[24:34.92]Ooh, $10,000.
[24:36.24]Thanks.
[24:40.42]Let's get a shotgun.
[24:42.70]Cool.
[24:46.87]Hmm.
[24:51.31]Wait, what?
[24:53.51]Mr. Wang, don't skip that.
[24:55.19]Well, he's pressuring me to skip these cutscenes.
[24:59.23]Yeah, I'm muted.
[25:00.94]Okay, when you get to... You tell a guy that you get a piece of cake and he gives you a shotgun.
[25:07.92]Right.
[25:08.18]That's when the tutorial's over.
[25:09.50]Okay, I just got the shotgun.
[25:11.42]Okay, so leave and we need to figure out how to multiplayer.
[25:16.97]I'm gonna put one in here.

[25:21.76]Can you hear me?
[25:22.38]Did I mute or am I unmuted?
[25:25.40]Okay, now he can hear me.
[25:27.90]So now that's it.
[25:30.28]We're ready to play.

[25:46.76]Hello?
[25:47.02]Hello?
[25:49.59]Yeah.
[25:50.75]Should I leave the game?

[25:53.23]You want me to leave the game?
[25:54.81]Yeah.
[25:55.75]Because now we have to figure out how to multiplayer.
[25:57.97]Just click multiplayer, right?
[25:59.59]Oh, no.
[26:00.73]Return to main menu.
[26:02.77]And then you start a game and allow invite only multiplayer.
[26:06.83]So, I think I can click on join game.
[26:11.50]Is that my hero?
[26:13.84]That's my game, right?

[27:31.87]I think I figured it out.
[27:34.00]Okay.
[27:36.36]You just have to go to the game you were just playing and put it on multiplayer.
[27:41.25]I'm an idiot.

[30:10.21]He's back with the twenty thousand, bitch.
[30:13.77]Jesus, dude.
[30:15.35]Well, good to have you back, man.
[30:17.73]Uh, thanks for the, thanks for the two hundred fucking bucks.
[30:21.25]The animations are low.
[30:25.27]You're gonna end up with, like, two Twitch badges.
[30:27.65]I don't even know if they exist.
[30:29.70]But thanks a lot, man.
[30:30.64]That's all I can say.
[30:32.56]It's crazy.
[30:33.38]What do you want me to say?
[30:36.12]What are we doing?
[30:37.00]What do you mean, where are we going?
[30:38.36]Up here.
[30:39.46]Uh, out here.
[30:42.48]Bet you can't chase me!
[30:43.16]We have to get in the car.
[30:45.85]Let's go!
[30:48.57]Alright, well, I don't know.
[30:51.82]I don't know, dude.
[30:52.44]I've got two drinks in front of me.
[30:53.68]One of them is a coffee.
[30:54.64]The other one is a coffee.
[31:04.97]I've been thinking about you all day.
[31:11.19]Have you?
[31:12.37]You laugh in my face.
[31:13.25]Now I gotta like
[31:21.67]I gotta appear offline again.
[31:22.73]Because this is just, uh... God.
[31:29.84]Holy shit, dude.
[31:30.68]Why is big picture mode the worst fucking thing ever made?
[31:34.58]Pretty bad.
[31:38.29]Because it has Steam Controller plugged in.
[31:40.75]I love how big picture is like, hey, do you have a Steam Controller plugged into your computer?
[31:44.11]That means you want to open in big picture every time, right?
[31:50.37]Alright, we're gonna use your fake access card to get inside the Zillow research lab.
[31:54.38]What's the chance by the end of this we both have headaches?
[31:58.90]85%.
[32:00.50]Oh boy.
[32:01.82]Yeah, that hurts.
[32:04.24]Can only I use that?
[32:05.86]Yeah.
[32:07.02]Alright, we could obtain an access card from what- What?
[32:13.15]What are you doing?
[32:13.65]I don't- Robots started shooting.
[32:16.61]You guys are shooting missiles.
[32:20.85]Why?
[32:21.27]This hurts my head.
[32:22.83]There's too many red beams.
[32:26.37]There's too many red lights.
[32:28.01]And there's water landing on my screen.
[32:29.97]There's boo-boos here.
[32:32.63]I should have put this on easy.
[32:33.82]Yeah, why are we playing this on hard?
[32:36.16]It's like reverse Tron colors.
[32:42.46]Red and blue together are not usually the best.
[32:46.56]Open the door!
[32:47.62]It wouldn't let me.
[32:48.36]We have to go around.
[32:48.94]Look at the mini-map.
[32:52.64]Let's go!
[32:53.78]What's your problem?
[32:54.90]I don't have one.
[32:58.12]Puke stream.
[32:58.86]Yeah, I apologize if you guys are like about to puke.
[33:06.47]Are these guys Halloween costumes?
[33:08.87]I thought that was you.
[33:13.49]I'm just gonna mash left click in everyone's face.
[33:17.25]That's my new strat.
[33:19.65]That's not my strat, I'm doing finesse.
[33:24.94]I don't even know what I did.
[33:26.77]I'm doing this blindfolded thing as well.
[33:29.41]Look, even their blood lights up like a Christmas tree.
[33:32.27]Why do they have LED blood?
[33:33.39]What the fuck is this?
[33:36.80]It's like, what?
[33:37.58]Do they really need to have LED blood?
[33:41.26]I don't think so.
[33:42.69]Who's this guy?
[33:44.07]Oh, no.
[33:44.43]I knew it.
[33:45.03]It's Joseph Stalin.
[33:51.85]I can't hear what this guy's saying.
[33:53.39]And they have the chromatic 3D colors on it like they're trying to piss me off.
[33:58.70]Oh, yeah.
[33:58.98]They're like trying to make everything look hard to look at.
[34:02.04]Alright.
[34:04.34]We need an access card from one of the soldiers.
[34:06.10]Did he drop one over here or something?
[34:07.94]Yeah.
[34:08.54]We can go back to the front door.
[34:13.37]What's this?
[34:15.69]Ooh, I got 164 monies!
[34:18.39]I got 242 monies.
[34:22.35]Okay.
[34:22.95]Thanks a lot, adnova.
[34:24.51]For the 1500 bits!
[34:26.71]Much appreciated, dude.
[34:28.33]There's also some subscriptions that came in.
[34:30.68]I'll get to those in a minute.
[34:34.24]Dude!
[34:36.04]Can I block the bullets?
[34:36.76]You think you can block the bullets like George Lucas in Star Wars?
[34:43.56]I don't know.
[34:50.18]No, I'm out of ammo!
[34:53.63]My crack shots are so low.
[34:55.43]Cover me, I'm gonna use my cheat.
[35:03.95]I used my chi.
[35:05.23]You open the door.
[35:06.11]You got a cool Halloween costume on.
[35:08.57]I bet you if we open the door, the next place is less neon.
[35:12.02]Okay.
[35:12.98]You want to make a bet?
[35:14.34]I want to make a bet.
[35:15.58]When you open this door, I bet you it's three times worse than what it is out here.
[35:19.38]I bet you it's half, like it's half.
[35:21.68]No, I'm going to go five times worse.
[35:24.39]Here we go.
[35:25.77]Oh, God.
[35:27.09]Oh, five times worse.
[35:28.27]I won the bet.
[35:29.01]Damn.
[35:30.55]I want it!
[35:31.33]Ah, I can't... Dude, I can't even look at it!
[35:33.21]Can you?
[35:33.57]Karma.
[35:39.65]What?
[35:40.49]You know very well video games are our religion, and this game is the one that I chose.
[35:44.65]How dare you?
[35:45.59]Hold on, I need to turn you up.
[35:46.99]You're getting drowned out by the screen.
[35:50.77]The game, like... What?
[35:55.18]Fucking semen everywhere!
[35:58.17]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[36:00.14]I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I just did like a, what was that move?
[36:02.08]That was so cool.
[36:02.74]Hey, the game's fun.
[36:04.82]The game, this is like a fun game.
[36:07.72]It's just really, really bright and colorful and ugly.
[36:10.84]Most of this game I don't think takes place in like neon cities anyway, so we just, just press on.
[36:15.53]Alright, I need to turn this thing down.
[36:19.41]Press on.
[36:22.43]Some health up here.
[36:23.09]Okay.
[36:29.05]Why are you not picking up all the juice?
[36:30.93]Because I need to get out of here.
[36:34.00]It's not going to change.
[36:36.36]Every room is a different color scheme.
[36:38.08]Don't skip.
[36:41.62]I thought he just transferred through and was talking through the screen.
[36:48.01]I have subtitles for that.
[36:55.35]What the...
[36:56.88]Yeah.
[36:57.86]I didn't know what she was saying, but now I know.
[37:02.98]Thank you, Mr. Applesauce, again.
[37:04.22]I bet you 100 bits.
[37:05.18]Well, there's the 100 bits.
[37:06.94]For real, though.
[37:08.18]TerzerkX, for the five months.
[37:09.92]Thanks a lot, dude.
[37:11.20]I'm not skipping it, but you're interrupting it.
[37:15.20]Gnoll94, thank you for subscribing.
[37:19.18]And then we had Waffen with the insane drop.
[37:22.70]What is with these striped lines going down my screen?
[37:24.56]Hopefully I got you guys here.
[37:25.64]CGFPDN, I believe I did.
[37:27.76]Pickled shrimp and you guys, thanks.
[37:32.06]Why is that necessary?
[37:33.52]What?
[37:33.94]These striped lines.
[37:36.52]Why is this entire thing green?
[37:39.22]It's like all they had was haunted house lights.
[37:43.64]Does the whole room have to be green?
[37:46.92]What's happening?
[37:48.90]Oh no, they're sucking her essence out.
[37:53.58]They're pulling out her essence.
[38:00.31]It's the exorcist.
[38:07.07]I know it's the window, but why would they make striped lines on the window?
[38:10.44]It's already obnoxious as hell to look at the green room!
[38:13.48]Hey, how about you keep complaining, Star?
[38:15.96]I will!
[38:18.33]Well, can't you just enjoy the game for what it is?
[38:19.77]A fun shooter.
[38:21.19]Can we... If we skip this, we could just look up in the Wangopedia what happened.
[38:24.47]Alright, I'm skipping.
[38:26.93]Fine.
[38:39.02]Alright, which way are we going?
[38:41.24]I want to upgrade the revolver.
[38:42.50]It seems like the funnest of all the weapons.
[38:44.27]Wait, I got a skill point or something.
[38:46.15]I don't even know what that was about.
[38:47.43]I didn't get a tutorial.
[38:53.48]That guy just got some artifact power.
[38:55.72]See that guy?
[38:56.14]That guy just had like at least 400 artifact power in his weapon.
[38:59.27]So I'm going to be making Warcraft references and nobody cares about it, aren't I?
[39:02.79]Yeah.
[39:04.57]I told people before, I asked you to play this yesterday and you told me what your eye level was in Warcraft.
[39:10.91]It was like, hey, Jerma, do you want to play Shadow Warrior tomorrow?
[39:13.55]And then you had a two minute long conversation with Boo about item levels.
[39:17.05]Yeah, because me and Boo were already talking.
[39:18.96]We were having a conversation.
[39:20.20]Okay, you just came to the call and were like, hey, do you want to play Shadow Warrior tomorrow?
[39:24.52]You were in the middle of a conversation.
[39:26.00]Maybe we're talking about high levels.
[39:27.76]I take priority.
[39:29.39]Oh, do you?
[39:30.41]You think you take priority now?
[39:32.53]After all the shit you've done?
[39:35.01]Yeah.
[39:35.37]What shit have I done?
[39:38.01]Spit on my pizza that one time.
[39:40.21]I've been supportive of you.
[39:41.41]Yeah, spit on that pizza that one time.
[39:43.07]I offered you to come here and stream if your internet wasn't working.
[39:46.27]Spit on my pizza that one time.
[39:50.56]Nobody knows about that story.
[39:51.54]You're spitting on my pizza when I was in the bathroom.
[39:53.32]I wanted our DNA to meld to match.
[39:58.78]Alright, there's too many arrows on the screen.
[40:00.40]What do we need to do?
[40:00.94]I won't apologize.
[40:04.23]Hey, do you want to look at the floor for a second?
[40:09.59]Okay, don't do that.
[40:10.35]It's a bad idea.
[40:12.13]Defeat Zillia's men?
[40:14.17]Defeat Zillia's men?
[40:16.25]What about Zilla?
[40:17.17]Is it Zillia?
[40:18.11]Zillia?
[40:22.84]Where are the men that we have to defeat?
[40:28.44]Oh, no.
[40:29.44]Oh, I just turned my light over.
[40:31.00]It's better when it's pointing the other direction.
[40:36.34]Cool, we can just frame.
[40:39.04]I think we're missing something here.
[40:41.96]Okay, yeah.
[40:42.42]There are guys over there.
[40:45.00]It's the only men over there.
[40:46.98]Where?
[40:48.10]Right here.
[40:50.35]It's a fucking floating ball.
[40:52.11]I gotta do toggle instead of hold to aim down sights.
[41:00.15]I like toggle better.
[41:01.91]This is driving me nuts.
[41:04.99]I didn't even realize there was an aim down sights.
[41:07.40]You didn't even try?
[41:08.36]How long do you think it took them to design these enemies?
[41:13.34]Am I just gonna complain the whole time?
[41:15.90]I think you are.
[41:20.58]I need to do toggle.
[41:22.42]Game and HUD.
[41:22.94]Come on.
[41:23.32]Toggle.
[41:25.32]Don't worry.
[41:26.22]I'll just kill everything.
[41:27.58]I'll kill the rolling boulders.
[41:34.16]Invert smooth.
[41:35.10]No.
[41:36.16]Toggle.
[41:36.62]Come on.
[41:40.92]Chi blast.
[41:43.24]Weapons wheel.
[41:44.14]Can you do it?
[41:45.32]Did I miss something here?
[41:47.86]I don't know.
[41:50.63]What's your eye level?
[41:51.45]851, for those that care.
[41:58.20]Okay, hold on.
[41:58.78]Enable hints.
[42:01.52]Subtitles.
[42:02.30]I'll turn on subtitles, just for people to see.
[42:06.02]Melee weapon steering?
[42:12.29]I don't think it exists.
[42:15.65]Well, that really sucks if it doesn't exist.
[42:22.30]I guess I don't know.
[42:23.77]I might be an idiot.
[42:24.63]I don't think I am.
[42:25.23]Remember, you're an idiot.
[42:28.89]I don't think I am.
[42:29.41]Are we to go downstairs?
[42:37.22]Are we going to go the other way?
[42:41.23]No, there's like a chest on the map here.
[42:44.07]I want the chest.
[42:44.87]You honestly, for a guy that's talking this much shit, you care about the chests in the game?
[42:48.69]I got bullets medium.
[42:50.29]Let's go.
[42:52.40]Let's go.
[42:52.94]I come down the stairs to see what he's talking about and he's already leaving.
[42:56.08]No.
[42:56.18]How fast are you moving this?
[42:57.26]What?
[42:58.16]I'm taking the bullets.
[43:00.40]See, so I got a new Wanglopedia entry.
[43:06.72]Hey, you know you can grab on ledges and like parkour?
[43:09.47]That's kind of cool.
[43:10.63]Hardcore parkour?
[43:11.45]Are we gonna have some enemies up here?
[43:15.50]Looks like they're gonna shoot robots.
[43:17.72]Thermite, I got a spam message yesterday.
[43:19.76]Like, you know, there's a spam bot in your chat.
[43:21.98]And it said... King finds queen dildo.
[43:27.77]How does that make you feel?
[43:28.67]I-I-I don't... I wasn't listening.
[43:32.07]Somebody found a... what?
[43:34.31]King finds queen dildo.
[43:37.49]And then it's a link.
[43:39.88]You're really about, like, the sex humor recently, huh?
[43:43.12]What's really funny?
[43:44.40]Come on!
[43:45.16]There's a lot of, like, sex jokes coming out of your mouth recently.
[43:48.14]I thought you were better than that.
[43:50.20]I thought you were more highbrow than that.
[43:51.52]I'm not.
[43:58.08]Guy up there.
[43:58.60]How are we going to... No, don't go.
[43:59.36]How are we going to take this guy out?
[44:00.30]We're going to do it strategically.
[44:01.16]You ready?
[44:01.42]Get out your revolver.
[44:03.22]We're going to both shoot him in the head at the same time, okay?
[44:08.21]Thanks for the countdown.
[44:09.50]Oh, nice.
[44:09.86]Great.
[44:10.62]I missed all the shots now because you fucked it up.
[44:12.92]Now we have the whole group here.

[44:27.87]I like the spin move.
[44:29.87]Yeah.
[44:32.13]Behind you.
[44:35.14]What's behind me?

[44:37.96]Are we in the Technodrome?
[44:40.98]Well, he's like the Foot Clan from, like, no, what's the name of the clan?
[44:45.08]What clan?
[44:46.16]From, uh, not Power Rangers, those are Putties.
[44:48.94]The Foot Clan, that's what they're called.
[44:50.21]Yeah, the Foot Clan.
[44:50.97]We're in the Technodrome.
[44:52.65]We're Ninja Turtles.

[44:54.93]I get to be Leonardo.
[44:56.55]See, I have the sword.
[44:57.63]Something's stopping this guy from... You have to kill the last ninja.
[45:01.49]Didn't you do the tutorial?
[45:03.37]I did.
[45:11.25]I'm just going to chop chop.
[45:14.01]Yeah.

[45:21.41]Yeah.
[45:29.45]It's kind of cool.
[45:34.65]You know, an actual video game here?
[45:35.89]It's kind of fun.
[45:38.85]But the graphics of this game?
[45:40.75]Kinda not fun.
[45:43.99]Give him the old chop chop.
[45:45.46]Don't worry, like soon enough we're gonna be in like... Japan.
[45:50.22]Wonderful Nippon.
[45:52.92]Watch out, it's a trap.
[45:54.16]She had a demon in her.
[45:57.60]You saw it.
[46:00.09]3, 5, 2, 1.
[46:00.25]We're gonna get that demon out of her.
[46:07.17]Stop doing math problems!
[46:09.57]That's not gonna save you.
[46:11.31]Fucking algebra is not gonna save you here.
[46:13.09]Why are we saving her?
[46:17.05]I don't know.
[46:37.01]Thank you, Darude.
[46:38.78]Thank you, Xtome9000.

[47:19.07]She doesn't usually do that.
[47:22.66]I told you, that's what I said.
[47:23.88]I made that joke like 14 minutes ago.
[47:25.50]Talk so much.
[47:26.40]Alright, skip.
[47:50.60]Like, if you say 40 words per second, one of them will have to be good.

[48:31.29]Excuse me?
[48:49.17]Let's just snort so we can skip.
[48:51.22]Dude, he's gonna suck her soul out.
[48:52.66]I don't trust this guy.
[48:53.84]Hey!
[48:54.00]I'm not gonna snort.
[48:54.76]Fuckin' my god, skip.

[49:52.13]In my head, I keep hearing... In your head?
[49:55.83]Am I... Oh, no, I know.
[49:57.33]She, like, breathed on you.
[49:58.89]That's why you... I'm gonna talk to you for, like, totally the rest of the game?
[50:03.47]She breathed.
[50:04.75]She breathed into your eyes, and, like, she went superstitiously into you.
[50:10.62]I'm riding shotgun with this dimwit.

[51:11.56]There's three slots underneath each weapon.
[51:13.88]You can put something in them.
[51:16.20]Like the gems you find can go in.
[51:22.98]And if you go to skills, if you have a skill point, you can put it in whatever you... Oh, I'm going to burp.

[53:20.54]I know.
[53:23.30]Don't worry.
[53:23.62]One of these days, I'm just not gonna do a vote.

[53:30.95]And it'd be so cool.
[53:31.81]Wait, new weapon.
[53:32.59]Mine.
[53:35.41]That's way too big.
[53:38.83]Chainsaw's fucking- it is giant.
[53:40.37]Yeah, that is very big and thin.
[53:43.31]Chainsaws don't look like this.
[53:46.01]You're holding a giant popsicle stick.
[53:48.72]With extra teeth.
[53:49.44]Mine's not a chainsaw.
[53:50.20]Yours is a chainsaw.
[53:51.20]I have the pre-order bonus sword.
[53:53.10]Yours is a chainsaw.
[53:55.88]That's a chainsaw you're holding.
[53:57.04]Sorry.
[53:59.34]You must not show it to other people, because if that's a pre-order bonus... Oh, auto!
[54:04.16]Auto!
[54:04.46]Does mine say auto?
[54:08.77]What?
[54:09.35]Does mine say auto?
[54:10.79]No.
[54:11.69]What?
[54:12.15]What?
[54:12.59]How come it and why?
[54:13.81]Of course it does.
[54:15.31]Oh, yes.
[54:16.31]Yeah.
[54:19.94]It makes you too happy.
[54:21.54]Oh, yeah.
[54:24.88]Let's go cut down some trees.
[54:27.20]Oh, shit.
[54:28.14]Sorry about that.
[54:29.34]It's a little too big.
[54:30.18]Did you see how big this thing was?
[54:32.22]It's a little too large.
[54:35.83]Yes.
[54:35.99]Yes.
[54:36.61]Throw me to the tree.
[54:38.13]That's not a tree.
[54:40.85]Hey, you want me to cook some dinner?
[54:42.07]What do you want?
[54:45.15]Home remodeling.
[54:48.92]Wait, what?
[54:51.48]Okay, we can go now.
[54:56.62]Otto, why is there a pole here?
[54:58.84]Where are we?
[54:59.44]I think we have to do, we have to pick up some gear from your apartment at the Wang Cave.
[55:05.47]Upstairs.
[55:09.97]Fuck music!
[55:11.21]Yeah, you never came and got whatever's at this desk.
[55:13.17]Musical programs!
[55:16.03]Termo.
[55:16.33]Get that shit out of our school!
[55:18.95]Replace it with arithmetic!
[55:20.89]Get rid of the arts programs!
[55:23.08]I only, only want fucking science!
[55:32.40]You're not gonna give me a chainsaw in a house and expect I'm not gonna run around like that.
[55:35.87]Sorry.
[55:37.32]We're not in a house.
[55:37.82]We're in the Wang Cave.
[55:38.80]I thought that was a guy.
[55:39.56]I thought it was Chip.
[55:41.32]Is there anything on this desk for you?
[55:42.88]No, I got it.
[55:43.80]I got it.
[55:45.37]Her face was just really weird looking.
[55:46.83]Yeah.
[55:47.05]Why do I have a dot there still?
[55:48.87]Hmm.
[55:58.12]Jerma had too much sugar today.
[56:00.30]Something's wrong with him.
[56:01.22]Oh, please.
[56:01.50]What are you trying to do?
[56:02.64]Are you trying to have fun while you play this?
[56:04.38]That was fun.
[56:16.18]Hey.
[56:17.08]Hey, you.
[56:17.64]Hey, out there.
[56:18.26]Hey, you know, hey, hey.
[56:20.66]Warcraft reference?
[56:22.50]You know in Warcraft when you have to do, like, shitty fetch quests?
[56:25.54]Yeah.
[56:26.48]Let's finish it.
[56:27.74]Hey, you're so... Can you, like, right-click or something?
[56:33.45]You're not supposed to be going through this.
[56:38.77]You got a nice phase blade there.
[56:42.71]Alright, I'm coming.
[56:44.93]But first let's get rid of this old couch.
[56:50.37]I'm sorry.
[56:52.87]I'm sorry.
[56:55.45]I don't think you are.
[56:56.47]Alcohol?
[56:59.23]You're gonna show alcohol to my kids?
[57:01.62]Not in a million years.
[57:02.82]Ban him.
[57:04.62]Ban this shit off the internet.
[57:06.26]Get rid of it.
[57:08.36]This is God's house.
[57:14.38]Hey.
[57:16.85]Alright, let's go.
[57:18.75]Okay.
[57:25.54]I gotta get my new gun.
[57:29.00]To do Kojima.
[57:29.68]Huh?
[57:29.80]Oh.
[57:30.80]And that's where I skip.
[57:45.01]Wait, how... I wanna... Oh, I know what's going on here.
[57:48.67]Uh, hey, Jerma, I have a good joke.
[57:50.75]I don't... Hey, can we not leave before you do, like, the chainsaw this room joke?
[57:54.01]I'm not gonna chainsaw this room.
[57:55.39]What's the joke?
[57:56.83]That's it.
[57:57.35]That's the... It would be really funny if you chainsawed this room.
[58:00.06]I'm not going to chainsaw this room!
[58:07.48]Goddammit.
[58:08.00]Let's go, quick.
[58:09.30]No, we have to talk to him again.
[58:11.02]Hey, what's going on, Hideo?
[58:13.00]The usual.
[58:13.96]Okay, then we can skip.
[58:15.60]Thanks.
[58:15.88]I don't know what we did.
[58:19.01]Ooh!
[58:22.09]This is new.
[58:23.91]These are new.
[58:24.81]He didn't give me anything.
[58:26.77]He gave me this awesome new item.
[58:31.36]What are we doing?
[58:32.26]I don't know.
[58:34.32]We don't have a quest anymore.
[58:36.00]There's one up there.
[58:36.54]See the quest marker?
[58:38.18]Yeah.
[58:41.41]But it's...
[58:44.45]I think we just have to go talk to him and now we can talk.
[58:47.04]I think he's going to teach us how to forge things or something.
[58:52.12]He didn't give me anything.
[58:54.48]Well, maybe it saw who was a good player.
[59:01.52]Find the ingredients for the curse, the cure, and bring them to Smith.
[59:04.89]This guy's name is just Smith?
[59:10.65]Okay.
[59:12.72]We have to go... This really is Warcraft.
[59:16.34]Let's go get the thing from the other side of the map and then bring it back to that guy.
[59:19.32]I'm glad you're getting to play your favorite game.
[59:21.40]Yeah, it's fun.
[59:23.98]There are two shops.
[59:25.60]Weapons, upgrades, and perks.
[59:26.82]So this is just like the hub.
[59:28.72]Okay.
[59:29.06]Yeah.
[59:30.04]Yeah.
[59:31.28]Yeah.
[59:32.64]Yeah.
[59:34.94]So we're going to talk to this guy.
[59:35.96]We're going to get his material.
[59:38.56]Larry, how's it hanging?
[59:40.64]Thanks a lot, Larry.
[59:42.94]Okay, you can buy from him.
[59:45.16]What are you selling?
[59:46.62]Alright, these are like upgrades.
[59:48.54]This is cool.
[59:52.17]Damage converted to elemental light firearms.
[59:54.41]Okay.
[59:54.91]I don't think we have... I don't have... It doesn't matter.
[60:00.74]That's showing us all this stuff that doesn't matter yet.
[60:03.14]Like, we don't care.
[60:04.18]We're just going... You want to go way too fast.
[60:06.25]Banged up piece of shit.
[60:07.91]Nerds.
[60:08.25]Nerds.
[60:08.59]You ready?
[60:08.79]Yes.
[60:26.99]Living with Larry.
[60:27.85]Is this our only transportation option?
[60:30.76]You got a better idea?
[60:32.64]Why is she made of a CPU motherboard?
[60:35.24]What?
[60:35.88]Teleporting?
[60:37.04]Actually, you're not far off.
[60:38.72]I wonder if she's, dude, is she like an Asus Extreme Deluxe P55?
[60:42.28]Or is she like a gigabit X89?
[60:43.66]Who knows, man.
[60:44.46]In the real world?
[60:45.40]How?
[60:56.30]I have no idea how it works, but I've been doing it for the... Okay, go to your... Open your missions... Oh, we get fast travel now.
[61:07.42]Missions.

[61:14.53]Yeah.
[61:16.87]Alright, did I teleport without you?
[61:20.73]Did I just go there without you?
[61:22.48]No, I'm loading.
[61:23.84]Okay, good.
[61:26.67]Wait, what?
[61:28.71]Can we get the 2011 Jerma voice?
[61:30.89]Can we get the 2011 Jerma voice?
[61:33.13]What the hell does that mean?
[61:35.75]2011.

[66:59.80]I'm learning.
[67:02.52]I'm in the bush.
[67:03.06]He can't see me.
[67:04.16]He can see you.
[67:09.81]Nice.

[67:54.43]It's my stuff.
[67:55.49]You don't get any of it.
[67:56.17]We actually share this stuff.
[67:57.11]That's unfortunate.
[67:57.83]It's my stuff.
[67:59.01]Yeah, we do.
[67:59.43]Okay, I want to change out weapons here.
[68:02.75]Equip this thing.
[68:09.59]This is the thing I wanted to have.
[68:10.85]Wow, what does this thing look like?
[68:11.85]It's like a blue snot.
[68:14.01]Shut up.
[68:14.81]Shut up.
[68:18.01]Okay, let me... Damage resist.
[68:24.38]Damage to small enemies.
[68:25.78]Critical damage bonus.
[68:27.16]Yeah, that's definitely going into this thing.
[68:30.98]No matter how many times I click it.
[68:36.58]Oh, it's because it's already equipped.
[68:38.62]I'm starting to understand.
[68:40.48]Yes, you are.
[68:44.71]Yeah.
[68:50.21]You can hide.
[68:54.05]Max Chi.
[68:55.89]Chi regeneration.
[68:59.17]You're the slowest person I've ever met in my life.
[69:04.41]I'm looking at the skill points, dude.
[69:06.67]Don't you want to see what the hell we can even do?
[69:13.53]Have you been putting any points in?
[69:16.15]I didn't realize there were other tabs.
[69:18.49]I love how you keep talking shit and then just looking.
[69:22.21]You have to look at the menu for two seconds.
[69:24.94]I don't even know what this... What game are we playing?
[69:27.38]And there's more stuff in the Wanglopedia.
[69:28.72]Okay, I need to equip the... I thought I took this off.
[69:46.39]I'm gonna be the stabber.
[69:55.99]Who cares about the Wangopedia?
[69:57.47]Okay, I'm redoing some stuff here.
[70:00.54]Give me a second.
[70:04.60]I'm giving you a lot of seconds.
[70:11.58]I don't like this thing.
[70:15.20]And then this.
[70:15.64]Alright.
[70:17.00]That's fine.
[70:17.42]Alright, I'm ready.
[70:27.63]Mine?
[70:28.11]Got it.
[70:29.15]Okay, now spend another 10 minutes doing whatever you have to do with that.
[70:32.96]New chat.
[70:33.66]Hold E to start.
[70:34.52]Don't start it.
[70:35.22]I think we have to.
[70:40.41]What's it do?
[70:41.03]Checkpoint.
[70:41.33]Rats.
[70:41.47]I don't understand this.
[70:42.27]Oh, I like it.
[70:42.63]You don't like this game?
[70:43.29]I don't like this chainsaw sword.
[71:07.16]More like, how do you reverse engineer the human biome to create implantable machines that can run off of endogenous cellular energy?
[71:13.89]Oh, like that.
[71:15.79]Like that.
[71:16.59]Sorry.
[71:17.41]I skipped the chat.
[71:19.65]I don't want to chat with the local singles in the area.
[71:23.13]I do.
[71:24.15]Well, hey.
[71:24.99]Excuse me.
[71:25.37]I'm right here.
[71:27.29]Hello.
[71:27.65]Hi.
[71:27.95]How are you?
[71:28.29]How's it going?
[71:29.97]Oh, yeah.
[71:30.15]That's true.
[71:30.61]You are, like, alone.
[71:31.53]Oh, what did you just say?
[71:36.13]Say that again.
[71:37.83]No, the moment's passed.
[71:40.03]Don't you dare.
[71:40.65]I know what you're gonna do to this poor bunny.
[71:42.02]Don't swing your fucking sword at him.
[71:44.42]Nice.
[71:46.16]Nice job.
[71:48.28]Nice work.
[71:49.82]Oh, what the fuck?
[71:53.28]Wow.
[71:56.46]I'm charging up the stab.
[71:57.88]I'm charging up the stab.
[71:59.92]He's gonna sting you with his sting.
[72:01.28]He's got a face.
[72:02.02]He's got like a big skull face.
[72:08.29]The thing's just on fire.
[72:09.35]Watch out, the fire guy's gonna get you.
[72:14.41]I don't like this weapon.
[72:15.01]I'm gonna keep using it.
[72:18.06]I don't have ammo for my shotgun.
[72:19.32]That's what that is.
[72:21.92]Yeah.
[72:27.16]Cheat.
[72:28.87]Excellent.
[72:35.62]I don't appreciate that word.
[72:36.78]I think I got him a couple times.
[72:46.30]You can't get him.
[72:47.50]What are you getting?
[72:48.48]Who are you getting right now?
[72:49.64]That guy.
[72:50.30]That gives me motion sickness.
[72:57.43]I did it by accident.
[73:04.14]A lot of stuff on the ground.
[73:07.21]Can we fight the thing?
[73:09.03]I'm standing in front of him shooting with a shotgun over and over again.
[73:12.17]No, can we fight it and you stop talking about what's on the ground for once?
[73:15.17]What have you done?
[73:18.25]I've sacrificed everything.
[73:19.97]What have you done?
[73:21.57]What have you given?
[73:24.18]How do I know that you don't?
[73:25.26]Because you made a demon hunter and I didn't.
[73:27.84]Oh yeah.
[73:29.68]So that's a reasonable answer.
[73:33.77]Just like the Diablo II days.
[73:37.71]This is giving nice D2 vibes.
[73:39.77]Where you just spam and try to click as many things on the ground as possible.
[73:42.75]I thought that was a weapon.
[73:48.14]It's just some guy's leg.
[73:54.30]Bow and arrow.
[73:54.78]Are you serious?
[73:55.98]Yeah.
[73:59.12]It's not a bow and arrow.
[74:00.10]It's a Yumi.
[74:02.37]Whatever it is.
[74:02.87]Like Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi?
[74:04.65]No.
[74:04.73]Love that show.
[74:05.45]No.
[74:06.03]No.
[74:07.88]That illusion!
[74:09.02]What are you hiding?
[74:11.78]Hold on a second, Starz.
[74:12.74]Something's not quite right.
[74:17.96]Oh shit!
[74:18.56]That illusion!
[74:21.32]Is this another Warcraft joke?
[74:22.90]No.
[74:23.72]It's from a movie.
[74:27.19]Something's not quite right.
[74:34.39]I feel like we're going to get ambushed.
[74:36.79]I can tell you right now, I feel an ambush.
[74:40.23]Uh oh.
[74:40.67]Okay, this thing's fucking incredible.
[74:41.85]That was 471 damage.
[74:42.51]Are we just going to be the bow brothers?
[74:49.64]Of course we are.
[74:51.94]Uh oh, ambush.
[74:56.83]Excusez-moi.
[74:59.67]Excusez-moi.
[75:01.01]This thing is awesome.
[75:04.42]Yeah, how come all of her other weapons don't do damage?
[75:08.40]Oh, you got that guy right in his head.
[75:10.42]Watch out!
[75:11.48]I don't even know what these things are called, but... Guy.
[75:14.02]These are... This is a high, high puffy on the enemy.
[75:21.67]This thing doesn't have very much ammo, though.
[75:22.87]I can't wait to upgrade the shit out of this.
[75:24.79]How do you cancel... Oh, shit, it does have ammo.
[75:26.39]How do you, like, cancel?
[75:27.29]I don't want to shoot this.
[75:31.11]Oh, yeah, okay.
[75:34.89]Dude, I bet there's a secret up here.
[75:36.01]There's a secret up here.
[75:36.79]I bet you.
[75:37.05]I bet you.
[75:37.29]I bet you.
[75:37.57]I'm going to find the secret before you find the secret.
[75:38.92]There's a secret up here for sure.
[75:40.22]I'm going to go find the secret.
[75:41.32]Fucking secret, huh?
[75:44.72]Don't think so.
[75:49.92]You found it before.
[75:50.46]I found the secret.
[75:51.16]I found the secret.
[75:51.96]I found the secret.
[75:54.11]I bet you I find the secret.
[75:55.25]I found the secret.
[75:56.43]It was where we were supposed to go the whole time.
[75:58.13]You need to get here.
[75:58.75]You're missing ammo, man.
[76:05.86]Shut up.
[76:07.02]I guess it doesn't matter what you have out.
[76:08.18]It's just going to be... Ooh, lots of stuff.
[76:11.14]Lots of cash.
[76:13.43]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[76:14.71]Come up here.
[76:15.11]Co-op me.
[76:15.99]Come co-op.
[76:16.83]I'm ready to co-op.
[76:18.07]He's right here.
[76:18.47]You ready?
[76:19.07]Three, two, one.
[76:20.93]Co-op.
[76:22.19]That was actually a really good co-op because we both hit him and it didn't kill him with one arrow.
[76:25.83]Nice job.
[76:26.47]Yeah, nice co-op.
[76:27.67]Hey, wait.
[76:28.07]Come over here again.
[76:31.01]Yep.
[76:33.36]Damn.
[76:35.02]That would have been really funny.
[76:36.02]Oh, watch, there's an exploding barrow next to him.
[76:38.68]Yeah, that's hilarious.
[76:39.58]Yeah, I'm gonna shoot it next to him.
[76:41.64]You know, it's... You know, STARS, uh... Dude, I'm going to... I'm comedy, right?
[76:47.40]No.
[76:49.34]No, on the comedy scale, I think you're... You know, comedy, right?
[76:53.64]You're a zero on the comedy scale.
[76:55.65]Sorry, dude.
[76:58.81]The late, great Rodney Dangerfield once said... Hey, let me tell you something.
[77:03.21]STARS is pretty low on the scale.
[77:06.60]He said that.
[77:06.94]He really did say that.
[77:07.82]Right before he died.
[77:10.66]That's how you get all the respect.
[77:11.94]Star is one of the worst comedians I think I've ever seen.
[77:17.37]Where are you?
[77:18.35]Right behind you.
[77:29.12]Guy.
[77:29.26]Watch out for Guy. 500.
[77:38.74]Watch it.
[77:40.04]Zombie.
[77:41.98]Kill guy.
[77:42.64]Kill guy.
[77:43.44]Kill guy.
[77:44.30]I'm switching that out.
[77:46.04]Stop.
[77:48.02]Don't use too much of your arrows.
[77:50.44]I'm not using any arrows.
[77:51.56]I'm using a sword.
[77:54.44]Don't touch the poison statue.
[77:57.85]Apparently it was a blow up.
[77:59.39]It was a bag full of rocks.
[78:01.61]Yeah, and you're a bag of shit.
[78:10.90]I gotta talk to my chat real quick.
[78:14.46]Just tell me what... I'm gonna follow you.
[78:15.90]I actually have important things to talk about.
[78:19.61]So, is the stream... What time is it right now?
[78:22.53]The stream is still going strong, right?
[78:24.03]No problems?
[78:26.05]Not that I've realized, because this is the first day streaming on my new internet.
[78:30.85]I just want to make sure if any frames have dropped, how's it been so far? ...
[78:40.98]That's good.
[78:44.44]That's good.
[78:52.27]It's been about an hour or so.
[78:53.93]Okay.
[78:56.83]I'm hoping it stays good.
[78:58.27]Because I have way more upload than I used to.
[79:00.48]I'm at like 18 up.
[79:03.12]Instead of I think I was on 10 before.
[79:05.46]That guy just fucking blew up.
[79:09.68]Wow.
[79:10.80]Ugh.
[79:16.12]When we get new emotes?
[79:17.64]Very soon.
[79:19.36]I just have to think of what I want to do.
[79:25.38]Visuals don't tear.
[79:26.18]Yeah, hopefully it looks okay.
[79:33.63]Gonna deliver more cheesy lines per minute.
[79:36.45]But again, I want to say, I want to make sure I reiterate this.
[79:40.58]It still is possible that something is still very wrong with my internet.
[79:45.43]I was told by the technician that came out here that put the new line in.
[79:49.73]He's like, yeah, yeah, this might fix it, but it might not.
[79:53.77]There might be a problem with the node on your street.
[79:57.18]So, if the stream does go down again, I'm really sorry.
[80:01.34]It's something I've been dealing with for the last two or three weeks now.
[80:05.67]I hope it doesn't.
[80:06.93]But I was told it shouldn't, but it still might.
[80:09.23]Because it might not even be a connection here.
[80:11.29]It might be a node problem.
[80:13.45]Or a server connection problem somewhere.
[80:19.75]But, that's pretty much all I got to say.
[80:22.17]Thanks for coming out regardless if we end up getting cut off early.
[80:26.49]Which it shouldn't.
[80:29.61]Holy fuck, there's a lot of people here.
[80:37.97]Ooh, right on his head.
[80:47.89]Did you see he just tried to dodge that?
[80:52.48]I just killed so many people.
[80:53.88]I don't know where he was.
[80:55.40]Hopefully he was doing things.
[80:57.04]I just killed like five people right there.
[81:04.83]Alright.
[81:07.24]That just got a lot of kills there.
[81:09.40]What are you doing?
[81:14.76]That didn't hit him?
[81:15.30]Are you kidding me?
[81:24.51]It's all about the parry, dude.
[81:26.21]Once you parry, they get stunned.
[81:31.85]He's muted.
[81:32.43]It's okay.
[81:33.93]Oh, yeah, I'm muted.
[81:34.61]Hi.
[81:35.05]Yeah.
[81:35.53]Hi.
[81:37.73]I forgot about you.
[81:39.10]I was having a really interesting conversation with my chat.
[81:41.56]My chat.
[81:42.46]You can talk to him.
[81:44.02]I'll talk to my chat.
[81:44.78]Ready?
[81:45.22]Let's go.
[81:45.50]3, 2, 1, go.
[81:46.14]No.
[81:47.30]No.
[81:49.17]My chat sucks.
[81:52.00]Uh, thank you, uh, I'm gonna say hi to some subs here.
[81:54.43]Come on.
[81:55.79]Thank you, Aidenova for 100 bits.
[81:57.43]Decalus for 100 bits.
[81:58.81]Zshpi for 7 months.
[82:00.03]Thanks, dude.
[82:01.17]LMK for 3 months.
[82:02.87]Rogue Giant, thanks for subbing.
[82:05.13]Uh, all these Decalus with, like, a bunch of bits in a row.
[82:07.04]Thanks, dude.
[82:07.74]Can I do 20-20?
[82:09.54]Thanks, Derp Mayor.
[82:10.18]Thank you, Declis, again.
[82:11.56]JJ00, thanks for the sub.
[82:13.38]Thank you, Paco Taco, for your five months.
[82:15.66]And then, hello, rello fellow.
[82:16.94]I believe that's where we stopped.
[82:18.64]So, thanks a lot.
[82:19.56]I need you to do this.
[82:20.52]Come over here.
[82:21.46]Please.
[82:23.20]Please.
[82:24.86]I'm here.
[82:26.24]I'm right here.
[82:28.88]You're not.
[82:32.72]Grandma.
[82:35.05]I'm on the way.
[82:39.19]People are telling me to turn my facecam on.
[82:40.63]That's not gonna happen.
[82:41.37]Are you using facecam?
[82:44.23]No.
[82:44.37]Turn your face up, Charm.
[82:45.45]I can't hear.
[82:45.95]Turn your face up.
[82:46.77]Oh, watch out!
[82:47.35]Look out!
[82:47.67]It's a bomb!
[82:48.75]Right.
[82:51.08]Turn your face up.
[82:59.42]These guys blend in with the environment.
[83:00.98]I can't even tell if I'm hitting anything.
[83:03.08]You're not.
[83:03.56]You're missing.
[83:04.10]You're missing every shot.
[83:07.67]Hey, we got our wish, though.
[83:14.64]We're no longer on the electricity maps.
[83:19.84]Yeah, I'm telling you.
[83:21.66]This one is tolerable.
[83:25.64]Can you parry with this thing?
[83:27.04]No, definitely not.
[83:32.22]Grind him up.
[83:33.34]Grind him up like a dinner.
[83:34.04]I'm actually surprised that this is the, like...
[83:37.38]The hard mode.
[83:38.08]Because I've been playing like a complete moron.
[83:40.98]I mean, there was a harder one.
[83:43.94]But still.
[83:45.34]This was like the second hardest.
[83:52.13]This doesn't seem too outrageously difficult.
[83:56.87]That's what I'm saying.
[83:57.59]That guy can't even do one move.
[84:04.58]He was trying so hard.
[84:05.90]Hey, come get this thing!
[84:08.66]Get this thing!
[84:13.08]No, the gemstone.
[84:14.24]Got it.
[84:16.08]We have money now.
[84:16.70]We can spend.
[84:17.18]Dude, what are you going to buy?
[84:20.02]I think we have time.
[84:22.76]We have to talk to the smith guy.
[84:27.51]I think we got all we needed.
[84:29.51]I think we can teleport.
[84:31.01]Here we go.
[84:31.97]I have to follow you.
[84:36.63]Alright.
[84:40.21]Apparently I don't have to follow you.
[84:44.53]You can just do it on your own, right?
[84:46.21]Yeah.
[84:48.09]Will there be an opportunity for a Pop-Tart joke in this game?
[84:50.33]Probably not.
[84:50.87]No glass breaks.
[84:54.84]You've got Wang speaking.
[84:59.32]Hello.
[85:02.26]I tracked down the gems.
[85:03.24]I'm skipping this.
[85:04.80]New melee.
[85:05.38]Oh, these look cool.
[85:06.06]He needs crude.
[85:07.16]What the hell does that mean?
[85:32.74]Grip of Darkness?
[85:39.64]You get spells now.
[85:43.08]These are new.
[85:43.84]I don't know if I like these.
[85:50.09]These might be too short-range.
[85:51.25]I can charge this up for a long time, too.
[86:03.51]I don't know.
[86:13.13]Practicing?
[86:13.67]Alright.
[86:18.31]We need to do a mission.
[86:19.29]We need to teleport.
[86:20.87]But first, I want to buy some stuff.
[86:22.65]So, I need to wait a minute.
[86:29.96]What was that on?
[86:32.08]There's another mission, too.
[86:33.04]I guess we can pick up multiple missions.
[86:41.44]Where is this?
[86:41.96]Right here.
[86:43.32]Alright.
[86:44.18]What do you have for weapons, mister?
[86:49.77]What are you selling?
[86:51.91]These are augmentations.
[86:56.03]Could be electricity, man.
[86:57.05]I don't know.
[87:03.66]star are you with us oh yeah uh oh yes I mean if we're gonna waste our time here you know what I mean oh you can sell sell like your junk I guess sell I don't have any junks I mean everything I pick up is worth a lot
[87:32.03]Why am I an idiot?
[87:33.29]I don't know.
[87:34.01]Why are you, dummy?
[87:36.37]Why are you, dummy?
[87:37.21]I just want to go.
[87:38.51]That last mission was easy enough that I don't even care about this yet.
[87:41.51]I just want to get more money.
[87:43.31]You don't have enough to buy the top tier.
[87:45.10]The top tier.
[87:46.56]We just started playing the game like an hour and 20 minutes ago.
[87:49.32]You want a top tier weapon?
[87:50.52]Let's do one more mission.
[87:52.00]There's a marker up here.
[87:53.82]Yeah, over there.
[87:58.78]We'll get to that in a second.
[87:59.56]I want to see what we can buy.
[88:01.59]Not everything has to be a speed run.
[88:04.11]It's not a speed run.
[88:05.93]Yeah, it is if you do a mission, mission, mission.
[88:07.56]Let's just see what we can do.
[88:09.30]A common sense run.
[88:13.94]Improves healing values.
[88:17.34]Ooh, ooh, ooh.
[88:18.28]Here we go.
[88:19.26]That's what I'm talking about.
[88:21.87]Buy projectiles for your bow.
[88:26.47]That's what I'm talking about.
[88:27.89]Yeah.
[88:33.02]Jerma, that's what I'm talking about.
[88:34.24]It is.
[88:36.20]Thanks for, yeah.
[88:40.54]Okay.
[88:42.82]I'm selling everything.
[88:43.94]I'm just getting rid of all.
[88:45.02]Everything must go.
[88:47.46]Everything must go.
[88:48.48]Because you know what's going to happen?
[88:52.75]On next mission, the stuff that we find is going to be twice as good as the stuff that we just found.
[88:57.09]And we can already, we're already strong enough to do the next mission.
[89:01.62]But not everything's a speedrun.
[89:03.82]It's not.
[89:12.42]Make sure you put stuff into your... Bow.
[89:24.35]Everything's a speedrun.
[89:25.71]I know.
[89:27.97]I don't have to put anything into my bow.
[89:29.31]It's not a speedrun, Jerma.
[89:33.64]Oh my god.
[89:35.38]He doesn't have an off switch.
[89:36.34]He just doesn't.
[89:37.06]You ready?
[89:39.80]Let's go.
[89:41.52]Yeah.
[89:44.10]How do I turn him off?
[89:48.03]You can't.
[89:48.71]Unless you hit me in the face with a hammer until the screaming stops.
[89:51.55]Somebody said good luck in your Overwatch competition.
[89:53.45]What does that mean?
[89:55.47]World Cup.
[89:56.50]No.
[89:57.93]He's going to lose.
[89:58.57]I mean, come on.
[90:00.35]Why didn't he say that in my chat?
[90:02.23]Why is he telling you to tell me to tell me good luck?
[90:05.25]Because then he put a Kappa.
[90:06.25]Because, like, you're going to lose.
[90:07.73]Not a big deal.
[90:08.45]Oh.
[90:10.05]Why doesn't that guy like me?
[90:11.07]You're going to get killed by a Reaper, like, five times in a row, and you're going to have a fucking rage moment in the arena.
[90:17.25]You're going to, like, take the keyboard and smash it into your knee, and it's going to break in half on your knee.
[90:22.21]How, like...
[90:23.95]How much would this clip be shared if I die and I pick up my computer from under the desk and throw it out into the audience?
[90:29.94]Well, they weren't refining fuel out here.
[90:32.24]No wonder they blew themselves up.
[90:34.76]What do you mean?
[90:36.00]On the first death.
[90:37.90]First death.
[90:39.48]The first time you die in the game, you just rip out all the cords, pick it up, and two-handed soccer throw it into the audience.
[90:45.44]Yeah.
[90:46.56]Well, I don't think you'd be invited back to another event.
[90:49.72]I don't think I would be, but do you think people would know my name, you know?
[90:53.06]Yeah, they would.
[90:54.25]Dude, I want to be fucking famous.
[90:56.01]They'd be like, who's the crazy guy that threw his computer into the audience?
[91:00.79]Crazy guy, more like popular guy.
[91:06.87]Crazy guy.
[91:14.38]Watch out for the Naga Sea Witch over there.
[91:16.96]I didn't even make that reference.
[91:18.34]You did.
[91:20.04]Exterminate.
[91:21.77]You made the Warcraft reference this time.
[91:24.05]Wait, you like that shot?
[91:25.46]You think I'd make it as Hanzo in the Overwatch Competitive Arena?
[91:29.60]You know what I like is that I have to hit this guy 30 times to do what your bow does in one shot.
[91:35.92]Yeah, but you only get a finite amount of bullets.
[91:42.16]Ooh, right in this base!
[91:47.43]Oh, crap!
[91:52.05]Nice shot.
[91:52.41]I do like this weapon, actually.
[91:54.09]This chest.
[91:55.11]Don't skimp on not getting the chest.
[91:56.67]They have a lot of good stuff in them.
[91:57.67]Can you shut up?
[91:59.73]Can you shut up?
[92:03.17]Is that a pro Hanzo?
[92:04.75]Yeah, it is a pro Hanzo.
[92:07.39]Why have you not corrected me yet?
[92:08.35]I figured you'd be like, oh, it's Hanzo, idiot.
[92:12.89]You gave me one second.
[92:14.99]Look at this.
[92:16.97]Ooh.

[94:39.92]Like, can you actually not see me?
[94:44.97]Where is he?
[94:45.53]This is like what you do to like an eight-year-old and they get pissed off and throw a fit like, no, I'm right here, mom.
[94:53.67]You are not here.
[94:58.04]I'm not buying into it.
[94:58.84]I'm not going to be the eight-year-old.
[95:01.86]Excuse me.
[95:06.66]I see like this.
[95:07.94]No, you're not here.
[95:09.94]He's gone.
[95:10.32]He's just not here.
[95:16.29]It's me versus the world now.
[95:21.55]If you're here, kill the scorpion.
[95:22.61]People are telling me that your stream died.
[95:25.71]Kill the scorpion.
[95:28.25]You ready?
[95:30.03]Oh my god, my stream did die.
[95:33.21]Hey, congrats on your new business class.
[95:37.03]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[95:41.40]Are you serious right now?
[95:46.06]That's sticky keys.
[95:48.48]Oh my... That's probably why I can't see you.
[95:51.56]Yep.
[95:57.56]And you just have him come out and... Somebody just subscribed.
[96:03.31]Oh my fucking lord, are you serious?
[96:10.52]Thanks Comcast for coming and replacing my whole internet for it to not matter fucking at all.
[96:16.01]That's great.
[96:17.65]You should take my advice.
[96:20.87]What's that advice?
[96:23.21]Right now my upload is at like 3.
[96:29.16]Like 2.0.
[96:29.36]It's supposed to be at like 18.
[96:34.86]Huh.
[96:35.44]Huh.
[96:36.04]Yeah.
[96:36.36]Well, apparently it went down enough that your stream dropped, but we're still talking and you're still in my game.
[96:42.51]Apparently.
[96:46.27]I mean, I can just try to ride it out.
[96:47.93]It might come back to normal.
[96:50.01]I don't know.
[96:51.09]It depends on how long it wants to just stay like throttled down to like two up.
[96:58.66]I don't know if people can hear me in my stream, but if they're watching your stream right now, then that's what's going on.
[97:04.63]I had a... I had a Jerma raid.
[97:07.03]Thanks for raiding my stream, man.
[97:11.71]Yeah, you're welcome for the raid.
[97:15.22]Uh... Yeah, this is, like, ridiculous.
[97:20.08]So, right now, what this means is there's, like... There is, like, a major server issue in my whole neighborhood.
[97:26.17]Like, my node... There's, like, a server node or something that has to get repaired.
[97:33.78]Because this is ridiculous.
[97:41.19]Are you moving around in game?
[97:42.83]No, I'm just standing still.
[97:44.53]Yeah.
[97:45.41]I was wondering how disconnected you were.
[97:51.02]No, my download is fine.
[97:52.08]It's my upload.
[97:52.92]Like, my download is fine, but I think when this started happening, remember I was like, where are you?
[97:57.60]You, like, weren't on my screen.
[97:59.54]So me, like, trying to communicate with this game's, like, server to, like, tell it where you were and I were and I was, it couldn't do it.
[98:06.30]But I could, like, I could still play because my download is fine.
[98:13.14]What a crock of shit, honest to God.
[98:15.62]I can't wait to get on the phone tonight.
[98:17.44]Dude, I am going to be, like, psycho customer tonight.
[98:22.32]You have every right to be after you bought, like, a business class.
[98:25.73]They came out and installed, like, all new shit for you.
[98:28.43]Dude, I am going to be psycho customer tonight.
[98:33.27]This call may be monitored for quality assurance.
[98:36.31]See, right now, we're back.
[98:37.43]Right now, it's back up.
[98:38.13]Like, I'm at, like, 14, like, 15 up.
[98:43.96]The stream should come back to normal now.
[98:46.30]In the next couple of minutes.
[98:54.11]Apparently my upload is back to normal.
[98:56.67]I have no idea.
[98:57.25]I'm going to try and test it again.
[99:04.68]I can see over here that it's trying to climb back from hell.
[99:20.38]I'm just gonna ride it out.
[99:23.30]No, no, wow, now we're down to .0.
[99:25.06]We're like at 0.6.
[99:26.30]We're gonna be monitoring the in-depth.
[99:32.20]How fucking crazy, dude.
[99:33.24]Like, I'm paying right now with Comcast Business for fucking at least 15 up.
[99:39.58]And the guy said it should go up to like 18 to 20.
[99:43.10]I'm gonna take a fucking screenshot of this and I'm sending it to the CEO.
[99:47.54]You know what's funny?
[99:48.92]Actually, it's not funny.
[99:50.01]But they hate when you do that.
[99:51.83]Fuck this company.
[99:56.52]If you take a screenshot of a speed test, they will tell you, well, that's not the official Comcast speed test.
[100:03.38]No, not the official Comcast speed test.
[100:08.25]All information you show them, because when I used to have problems, I was like, hey, I'm having issues.
[100:12.21]I had one of those screenshots.
[100:13.35]That wasn't the official Comcast speed test.
[100:16.47]All your information that's wrong, it's not as good as ours.
[100:21.73]It doesn't fake your numbers.
[100:26.55]oh well I'm gonna I'm gonna give this like another minute or two but yeah the guy told me this if there's still a problem now then there's like something going on on like the street there's like a problem there's like a leak somewhere move come live Ryan the rooms are only 200 a month
[101:00.65]Well, uh, I think, am I still in your game?
[101:03.95]Yeah.
[101:08.00]So, uh, I can't see where you are.
[101:10.36]I'm just gonna go to the checkpoint and just see if it comes back.
[101:12.72]Oh, I'm way behind you.
[101:13.44]I was dashing around.
[101:14.54]You see me behind you?
[101:15.76]I can't, no, you're not even on my screen.
[101:17.97]Oh, well, I'll still follow you and I'll be playing with you.
[101:20.85]Just assume that I'm playing with you.
[101:22.17]Alright, I'm just gonna assume you're still in my game.
[101:23.87]Alright.
[101:30.18]Looks like things randomly blow up.
[101:31.96]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[101:32.80]I think we're back.
[101:34.16]I think we're back.
[101:36.87]Hold on.
[101:41.21]I seem to be not dropping frames anymore.
[101:47.73]Come on.
[101:48.39]Stay lit.
[101:49.65]Stay lit up.
[101:51.91]Light them up.
[101:52.91]That's going to happen again.
[101:54.11]It's absolutely going to fucking happen again.
[101:55.53]So if you're watching my stream... No, it's already happening.
[101:57.57]It's already gone back.
[101:59.99]Yeah, it's gone.
[102:00.69]It's just all over the place.
[102:01.45]Yeah, your voice in TeamSpeak, robot it.
[102:05.09]What a piece of fucking shit, dude.
[102:07.72]This minute is fucking $130 a month.
[102:12.76]Oh, boy.
[102:13.74]I am fucking livid right now.
[102:18.79]I am so mad right now.
[102:22.00]My internet was like $79 a month, like $69 a month.
[102:25.74]I'm now paying $130 fucking dollars a month.
[102:28.72]And nothing changed.
[102:30.80]Oh boy, they're gonna hear this shit.
[102:32.88]I am so fucking mad right now.
[102:34.94]You should call them while you're... I really fucking should.
[102:37.58]I should call them fucking on stream.
[102:39.58]And like... What a fucking pain in the ass.
[102:45.71]Yeah, they would be... They're watching your stream right now.
[102:47.93]Don't do that.
[102:48.33]They're just gonna dox you, dude.
[102:50.15]I hope somebody watching the stream from Comcast... Like, if somebody... If there's a Comcast employee watching from, like, right now... You... You fix this shit.
[103:00.35]You fucking DM me on Twitter, and you get this shit fixed.
