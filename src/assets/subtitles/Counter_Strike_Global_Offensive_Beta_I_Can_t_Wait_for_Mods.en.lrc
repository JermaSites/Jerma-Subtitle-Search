[00:08.96]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.70]Jerma here with a Counter- Global Offensive gameplay commentary.
[00:15.89]And before I get into this video, at all I gotta thank, special thanks somebody for this beta key.
[00:21.81]Cause this game, if you don't know, is very very hard to get a beta key for.
[00:27.40]You are more likely to be struck by lightning than to get a Counter-Strike GO beta key.
[00:33.56]So thank you so, so much to the person that gave this to me.
[00:37.94]Because I didn't get this on my own.
[00:39.99]Somebody gave me this.
[00:41.53]And they don't want their name in the video, and I can totally understand that.
[00:44.49]But Anonymous, thank you so, so much, dude.
[00:47.69]You don't know how long I've been looking for one of these damn keys.
[00:52.03]And a follow-up to this, if you want to get into the beta and you don't know how, there is really only one way you can do it.
[00:59.40]You have to go to the Counter-Strike website, or I think you can do it through Steam as well.
[01:03.68]You have to do their survey.
[01:05.58]There's a Counter-Strike survey you can take, you fill it out, and you get put on the list, I guess.
[01:10.57]I did it a long time ago and I still haven't been called, but I'm pretty certain that's the only way you can do it.
[01:17.55]So now, what do I think of this game?
[01:19.59]Do I think this is a fun game?
[01:20.81]I've played it for a couple hours now.
[01:22.21]I've got maybe three or four hours into it.
[01:24.49]And this game is great.
[01:25.80]It is a lot of fun, guys.
[01:27.58]I can't wait till this actually comes out.
[01:29.38]Because the best part about Counter-Strike, to me at least, in my opinion, is not the default game modes.
[01:36.30]When this game finally releases and the modders and the map makers get their hands on it, that's when I have the most fun in Counter-Strike.
[01:44.21]I'll give you two very good specific examples.
[01:46.37]One of them is Jailbreak.
[01:48.59]If you've never played Jailbreak before, it is hysterical.
[01:52.93]It is one of the funnest mods I've ever played in any game.
[01:56.47]And I probably dumped in...
[01:58.45]God, probably a hundred plus hours into CS Source's Jailbreak.
[02:04.08]And when they finally get their hands on it and they make CS:GO Jailbreak, you better believe I'm going to be playing that a ton.
[02:11.47]I actually might do videos on that, to be honest.
[02:13.91]That could be some really funny content coming out of Jailbreak.
[02:16.87]Very briefly, I'll tell you what it is.
[02:18.51]I didn't even tell you what the hell the mode was.
[02:20.71]Jailbreak is there's two sides.
[02:22.61]There's the prisoners and then the prison guards.
[02:25.14]And the whole goal is you're supposed to follow the rules as the prisoners.
[02:28.84]They open up the gates and they go, prisoners, come out.
[02:31.56]Everyone listen to me.
[02:33.28]I want you all to walk ten paces to your left and Simon says jump.
[02:39.28]And if you didn't jump they would just shoot you.
[02:41.28]So it's stuff like that and if you were a prisoner- every time I was a prisoner I would never follow the rules.
[02:47.28]I would always like just oh Simon says jump and then I would just run at him and just start stabbing him.
[02:51.28]And sometimes it would work and you could pick up their gun because you don't start with a gun it- it's just crazy.
[02:57.00]Maybe I'll do a video.
[02:58.28]I don't even know. We'll see in the future
[03:01.02]But other than Jailbreak, really, probably Ice World.
[03:04.14]I know there's going to be a new Ice World.
[03:05.72]There's always an Ice World in every Counter-Strike.
[03:09.04]So Ice World, probably Snow World, but there was a Snow World, wasn't there?
[03:12.31]Just that tiny, close-corded deathmatch where all the guns are on the ground.
[03:17.21]And then you could only buy things if you were standing in the middle.
[03:20.05]But it was almost impossible to stand in the middle because the map was so tiny and bullets are just flying everywhere.
[03:26.49]I can't wait.
[03:28.05]But anyways, let's start talking about what's actually happening on the screen and what I think of this game for real.
[03:34.01]The actual game, not the mods or the potential maps they're gonna make for it.
[03:38.63]This game is pretty fast-paced.
[03:41.60]Most games in Counter-Strike will last less than one or two minutes for the whole round.
[03:47.46]And that's great because if you don't know when you die in this game, you don't come back.
[03:52.14]It's just like Arena Mode in Team Fortress 2,
[03:55.26]Or the search and destroy in Call of Duty.
[03:57.93]Same exact premise, when you die, you're permanently dead.
[04:01.58]And it is so refreshing knowing that these rounds are not going to last more than two minutes.
[04:06.81]I have OCD, I got ADHD, guys.
[04:09.21]I am one of those people that cannot stand no action for more than 10 seconds.
[04:14.67]If I die in Counter-Strike at the beginning of a round, I am so tempted to just hit escape and go into quit game, exit game, and go find another lobby, because it's like pulling teeth for me.
[04:25.49]Sitting there for more than a couple minutes is pretty much the equivalent of me punching myself in my own face 10 times.
[04:31.60]I don't know if it's like that for anybody else, but it's like that for me.
[04:35.82]And really besides that, the only real complaint I have about this game has nothing to do with the guns, has nothing to do with the gun mechanics.
[04:43.76]Because, I mean, they're all pretty balanced.
[04:45.24]The recoil is pretty easy to get used to.
[04:47.50]The reload times can be kind of slow on some of the weapons, and the AK-47's a little odd with its recoil.
[04:53.10]But for the most part, it's a pretty balanced game.
[04:55.00]The problem that I have...
[04:56.96]is shooting somebody in the chest or in any of their body parts it takes a lot of bullets to kill them and especially when you can get that one lucky headshot on somebody and kill them instantly and I know that it has a lot to do with Kevlar in this game
[05:12.41]But really, when I come around a corner, I've jumped around corners before spraying, and I've unloaded almost a whole clip on somebody's chest, and then I just get insta-headshotted.
[05:23.08]And it's really discouraging, and I know I have to just practice on my aiming, get those headshots down, but it can get discouraging, especially when you get the jump on somebody.
[05:31.52]That's my only real complaint I have.
[05:34.15]So that is going to wrap up this particular video on CS:GO.
[05:38.05]I'll leave you with a pretty gruesome headshot I got on somebody.
[05:42.15]So hopefully you enjoy that, and I will see you guys all next time.
[05:46.47]So take care, everybody.
