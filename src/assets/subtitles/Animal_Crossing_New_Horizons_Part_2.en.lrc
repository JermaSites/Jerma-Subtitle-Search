[00:09.50]Welcome back to Animal Crossing.
[00:18.10]This would be day two of Animal Crossing.
[00:22.84]What do you mean it was real?
[00:23.76]I told you we were doing this yesterday.
[00:26.76]Garbage game.
[00:28.59]In the middle of like a bunch of pogs.
[00:30.63]Garbage game.
[00:31.51]God damn it.
[00:33.31]It's alright.
[00:34.05]Don't worry, man.
[00:38.04]Let me just change one or two small things.
[00:46.75]That's good.
[00:47.75]It's going to probably flash for a second.
[00:50.69]Looks alright.
[00:51.57]I do have to change this.
[00:52.67]There we go.
[00:57.02]So this is day two.
[01:02.49]Let me change the title.
[01:04.63]Microgames 500% hurry.
[01:06.77]This makes sense.
[01:07.79]I mean, this is like microgaming, isn't it?
[01:13.63]Animal Crossing.
[01:14.97]New Horizons.
[01:19.05]Is this on the GameCube?
[01:20.07]No, it is not.
[01:22.19]It is not.
[01:26.69]So the question is, am I going to keep a face cam on for this?
[01:30.72]Fuck.
[01:33.71]I mean, I turned it on already.
[01:34.83]Fuck, I'm going to have to.
[01:37.35]Fuck.
[01:41.81]Well.
[01:43.45]Alright, let's go.
[01:46.71]Are you going to get negative viewers?
[01:48.25]That's alright, whatever.
[01:51.45]Who cares?
[01:53.45]We're just playing Animal Crossing, man.
[01:57.87]Why is it?
[01:58.15]What's going on here?
[02:03.98]Is it Donald Duck?
[02:05.58]What's wrong with Donald Duck?
[02:06.72]Why is Donald Duck in the game?
[02:08.12]Why is Donald Duck in this game?
[02:19.71]This is weird.
[02:21.57]Testing, testing, test, test, test.
[02:23.79]Hello, every... Oh dear, so sorry about that.
[02:26.99]The volume's a little loud there.
[02:28.99]Fix the screen.
[02:33.85]What's wrong with the screen?
[02:34.49]What are you talking about?
[02:40.00]What's wrong with the s- what do you mean- what do you mean the screen?
[02:44.26]Make it bigger.
[02:47.45]What is- what are you guys doing?
[02:48.65]Oh dear, so sorry about that.
[02:49.53]The volume is a little loud.
[02:52.11]Hello.
[02:52.37]Starting today, I'll be doing an island-wide broadcast full of island updates goings-on and such.
[02:57.49]Hmm?
[03:01.38]I'll go over some things that are very important to island life, so lend me your island ears for a short time.
[03:05.28]It's the only thing that we kick off this daily ritual with a doozy of an island announcement.
[03:11.20]The Salt Crest Airport is now open for business.
[03:17.70]Okay.
[03:17.94]You can use online or local communication to fly to other islands for a visit.
[03:21.56]That's not all.
[03:22.10]No, no, no.
[03:22.50]The airport counter now offers a postal service as well.
[03:25.56]Oh.
[03:28.19]And just like the Resident Service Center, the airport's open 24 hours a day, so please drop by for a look.
[03:33.65]Oh, I do have one other item to share, and it, too, is a Whopper.
[03:35.97]Hmm?
[03:37.49]As this very day, a brilliant fellow by the name of Blathers will be joining us at Saltcrest.
[03:40.78]That's the, uh, that's the... Let us in.
[03:46.38]I'm not fucking giving you guys my Nintendo Switch address.
[03:49.82]That's a mistake.
[03:50.38]As this very day, Blathers will be joining us at Saltcrest.
[03:56.34]Has a keen interest in biology.
[03:58.54]Past and present, and he's here to study saltcrest.
[04:01.32]I really hope everyone lends their cooperation.
[04:02.96]Yes, this is the museum guy.
[04:05.10]Alright, let's go pick up weeds and shit.
[04:09.25]Let us in.
[04:09.81]I'm not... No, I'm not letting all... I'm not letting you guys in.
[04:14.79]There are streamer codes.
[04:17.77]I just want to pick up fucking weeds and stuff and hit rocks with shovels for like an hour.
[04:24.39]Oh, that's got to change.
[04:25.93]I forgot about this guy.
[04:27.69]Uh, that looks bad.
[04:28.37]I don't want to look like this.
[04:32.21]Whoa!
[04:33.71]Look at all this mail.
[04:35.08]Happy Home Academy.
[04:37.24]Greetings from the Happy Home Academy, our goal.
[04:40.02]We want to make your home the best.
[04:41.52]Alright, give me it.
[04:46.64]Nook mileage program.
[04:48.50]Wish to express our gratitude for your continued use of the Nook Stomp and Nook mileage program.
[04:52.56]The item you claimed via our redemption is attached to this message.
[04:56.36]Oh, right.
[04:56.70]Didn't I buy a bunch of shit yesterday?
[04:57.94]Hold on.
[04:59.73]I got a lot of crap in here.
[05:08.29]Wooden mini table.
[05:13.16]Sweet, I learned it.
[05:14.08]Oh, DIY wooden table.
[05:15.42]I need a house.
[05:15.90]Wait, I got a house now.
[05:17.03]This is not a tent anymore.
[05:18.89]This is a house.
[05:20.65]Hold on.
[05:21.59]Important.
[05:28.90]Congratulations on the construction of your new home.
[05:30.36]Here are a few tips.
[05:32.96]Turn lights on.
[05:34.10]Enter decorating mode and open storage.
[05:35.82]That's good to know.
[05:36.32]Make the room brighter or dimmer.
[05:40.18]This feature lets you easily make design changes.
[05:43.18]And open storage.
[05:44.58]Yeah.
[05:45.36]When in your home, you can open your pockets, select furniture or other items.
[05:48.12]Yeah.
[05:50.88]I like that better.
[05:51.50]Okay, what about decorating?
[05:54.43]Oh, I don't have anything.
[05:56.93]I don't have shit.
[06:02.75]Okay, well let's pick this up.
[06:07.83]Put this in the corner.
[06:10.78]I'm so glad you don't have to push this and pull this and all that crap.
[06:18.36]Alright, switch.
[06:20.44]Right here.
[06:21.96]And then the radio of... What is over here?
[06:24.98]This house is pretty bad.
[06:26.99]Radio in the middle so we can both listen to our favorite tunes.
[06:30.23]And then the switch so we can both watch TV in bed.
[06:34.63]Looks good.
[06:37.49]Okay.
[06:41.67]No, that's the same thing.
[06:45.55]Do I have anything else?
[06:46.27]No.
[06:46.57]Alright, let's go get the elephant slides that I had.
[06:49.09]Let's go put them in here.
[06:53.41]I've got lots of mail and all this stuff.
[06:56.89]Alright, hold on.
[06:57.31]What's this one?
[07:00.84]Ooh, eyes!
[07:04.56]Oh, cool.
[07:04.84]Okay.
[07:05.04]And it's fucking 3D glasses.
[07:07.14]Alright, where should I put my slides?
[07:14.03]Changed clothes.
[07:16.97]My dear Jeremy, how is your new life treating you?
[07:19.69]Are you eating well?
[07:20.50]Brushing your teeth?
[07:21.26]Washing behind your ears?
[07:22.72]Oh dear, I'm all worked up.
[07:23.78]Here's a little something to help out.
[07:25.28]Eat it or plant it, but think of me, says mom.
[07:28.84]This is nice.
[07:29.54]This is sweet.
[07:33.42]Alright, elephant slide.
[07:34.32]Get it.
[07:37.54]I gotta go sell a bunch of crap.
[07:38.52]Alright, hold on.
[07:41.32]Elephant slide.
[07:43.72]Hell yeah.
[07:46.08]Oh yeah.
[07:46.86]It's just, it's so good.
[07:47.72]Alright, what does, what did Mom give me?
[07:51.39]Apples!
[07:51.85]Ooh, thanks, Mom!
[08:00.45]Should I turn it this way?
[08:03.43]Spin it.
[08:09.75]There we go.
[08:10.95]Can I get on it?
[08:12.59]If I can't slide this, this is not worth 4,000 fucking bells.
[08:19.52]I can't slide on this ladder.
[08:23.58]You've got to be shitting me.
[08:28.88]Put away the net?
[08:38.13]How do you just put something... Just put it away completely?
[08:40.11]Tap A. Don't hold.
[08:43.73]How do you put something down?
[08:49.02]Down on D-pad?
[08:49.84]Okay.
[08:54.06]I can't get on the slide.
[08:59.48]Great.
[08:59.70]Alright.
[09:03.19]Shopping.
[09:03.59]I got the loafers in.
[09:04.41]Can I throw this?
[09:05.07]No.
[09:06.79]Put this on.
[09:12.69]ZL to check your nook miles.
[09:17.79]Are those the same?
[09:18.53]Slip-on loafers?
[09:21.43]Oh, they're just... What's the difference?
[09:23.19]It's just green.
[09:25.05]It's not a big difference.
[09:25.85]Alright, I gotta get rid of some stuff.
[09:28.09]I can't even open my mail.
[09:30.97]Um... I gotta go talk to the museum guy.
[09:38.92]Dreamhouse.
[09:41.07]How many miles is it?
[09:41.98]500.
[09:42.00]That's pretty good.
[09:45.96]Put it in the house storage.
[09:48.30]Yeah, I will.
[09:50.72]Yeah, this is relaxing now.
[09:58.31]Now I'm like... This is good.
[10:02.37]This is where I want to be.
[10:05.16]Okay, how do I put this in here?
[10:10.33]Put it in storage.
[10:11.49]But I can hang it on the wall.
[10:14.98]I can hang the sneakers on the wall.
[10:18.02]Why would I do that?
[10:18.64]Alright, let's put... I'll keep everything else.
[10:30.63]In Back to the Future 3, what profession did Doc Brown have?
[10:33.87]He was a scientist.
[10:44.54]Okay, that's good.
[10:45.64]All the mail has been looked at.
[10:48.48]Right?
[10:49.18]Wait, where's my, um... Didn't I... Alright, I got everything.
[10:53.96]Okay.
[10:54.20]Alright, water this shit.
[11:02.35]These are gonna be beautiful the next time we play.
[11:06.75]Oh, shit.
[11:07.65]I just realized something.
[11:10.05]So those of you that weren't here at the beginning of the stream, I am not going to be here for at least a few days.
[11:16.97]I will be gone for probably four or five days.
[11:20.92]I know that I don't like to say that.
[11:23.86]But I have a lot of shit to do in my personal life.
[11:29.32]So a lot of things going on that has to be taken care of.
[11:32.36]What am I going to do about Animal Crossing?
[11:46.68]Just play offline and then update us.
[11:50.73]Dude, alright.
[11:51.45]What if I don't?
[11:53.97]What if I just, like, don't do that?
[11:56.52]Just play it off stream and then update you guys?
[11:58.06]That's okay?
[11:59.20]Alright, that sounds fun.
[12:00.94]Oh, I'm not gonna play for that much.
[12:01.88]Only, like, an hour or so a day.
[12:03.95]I might not even play.
[12:04.75]I'm gonna be so fucking busy.
[12:10.09]Um, those of you that are curious, uh, I'm moving.
[12:14.29]Staying in Vegas.
[12:15.98]But I didn't want to make a big deal about it because, obviously, many people hear that word.
[12:20.30]And it's really, really bad timing, too, because just how everything's getting set here.
[12:25.34]But, uh, staying in Vegas, just going to a different spot.
[12:29.26]And I didn't want to really talk that much about it because, obviously, when people hear the word moving, they go, Wait a minute, what?
[12:34.07]He's moving?
[12:34.91]He's fucking moving?
[12:35.79]No, not again.
[12:36.23]What's wrong?
[12:36.71]And so I don't want to, you know, make a big deal about it.
[12:39.03]Staying in Vegas.
[12:41.77]Uh, if somebody wanna link the- there's a link, there's a hashtag, uh, exclamation point thing that explains why.
[12:48.75]If you read it, it's- read it, it's- it's- it's very- it's right there, it's a few sentences.
[12:55.98]Where does- somebody's got it, right?
[12:59.80]No, no, no, no, no, no, think that- that- that- that- the exclamation point- there you go, somebody's got it, there you go.
[13:04.98]Why's it not working?
[13:06.37]So you see, since the number of hormones is increasing, I agree that we need- oh, there's like a- there's a person face down.
[13:10.11]Hold on.
[13:12.34]I should probably do that.
[13:12.94]I have every confidence that you'll find a way to handle this little puzzle.
[13:20.74]Holy shit, he's fucking moving!
[13:23.92]See, this is what I'm talking about.
[13:24.86]This is what I was talking about.
[13:28.76]Uh, the two of you have been training under me for how many years now?
[13:31.20]Hmm... This should be a piece of cake.
[13:38.21]No more rumor.
[13:39.39]I don't know.
[13:40.39]I don't think that's possible in Las Vegas to not have a rumor.
[13:45.91]I don't think that's possible.
[13:48.52]Are you happy with your home?
[13:49.30]Is it meeting your expectations?
[13:50.94]You'll be a lot more comfortable now.
[13:52.50]Houses are so different from tents.
[13:54.30]You can really change up the flooring and wallpaper.
[13:56.64]You've got some built-in storage so you can put away the furniture you aren't using.
[14:01.80]There's more.
[14:03.28]There's more.
[14:06.80]All homeowners are automatically registered with the Happy Home Academy.
[14:09.55]Uh, and evaluate your home on a regular basis to send you helpful advice.
[14:14.47]Are they gonna evaluate my house?
[14:18.51]No more streams for another season?
[14:20.13]No, no.
[14:22.20]The move from Vegas to Vegas is not the same as the move from Boston to Vegas.
[14:28.04]One of them is across the country.
[14:29.24]The other one's in the same city.
[14:32.74]So, it... I will be back...
[14:36.35]Within four or five days.
[14:38.89]It's not gonna take that long.
[14:40.49]Trust me.
[14:42.23]Trust me.
[14:44.28]Yeah, the mileage on a hot air balloon... I'll get there in like four, six, seven days.
[14:49.62]Something like that.
[14:50.62]Four to five years.
[14:53.52]Not four to five decades.
[14:56.17]Am I even gonna be alive in five decades?
[14:59.01]Old am I.
[15:01.98]I'll be like 85.
[15:03.90]Am I going to be alive when I'm like 90?
[15:05.40]I don't even... That's like a long fucking time.
[15:15.90]Why do I like Vegas?
[15:18.50]Well, we... I mean, you're talking about a conversation we had dozens and dozens of times almost two years ago.
[15:25.85]I'm here.
[15:26.97]I love it here.
[15:28.17]I love this city.
[15:28.77]So I want to stay in this city.
[15:32.14]pretty much it oh that 98 000 bells can I pay in miles can you pay in miles oh no let's have to Etalyx I think Etalyx is staying here I think Etalyx is staying in Vegas too that's the plan
[15:54.41]So, look, the last couple years has been sort of a trial period if it was something that we wanted to even do.
[16:05.74]You know, I remember this, I've never done anything like this before.
[16:09.18]I lived in Massachusetts my entire life.
[16:12.20]So, coming out across the whole country was like, you know, obviously I wanted to spend a year or two years or so to find out
[16:19.99]Is this something I actually want to do?
[16:21.41]Do I actually want to be here more than a year or two?
[16:23.64]That was for everybody involved.
[16:25.90]And the answer is yes.
[16:29.02]And wherever, you know, wherever Etalyx ends up wanting to be, that's where he wants to be.
[16:34.66]And I'm pretty sure he's staying in Vegas.
[16:39.13]That's at least the plan.
[16:42.59]But that's kind of what, that's the way it is, right?
[16:45.97]I forgot about the Nightbot command.
[16:47.83]Oh no, end of the gamer hubs.
[16:52.44]No, he's not staying with me.
[16:53.72]No, not anymore.
[16:55.12]Not after this week.
[16:57.62]Is Kim?
[16:58.02]Yes, Kim is coming with me.
[16:59.52]Kim and I will be moving and so will Etalyx as well.
[17:04.43]But I can't... I obviously don't want to make a big deal about moving because I'm not going very far.
[17:12.39]I'm staying in the city of Las Vegas.
[17:14.42]So you... Honestly, I'll be honest with you.
[17:16.90]You probably won't even really see a difference for stream downtime.
[17:21.71]Because the plan is, by this weekend, to be done.
[17:28.91]We'll see.
[17:32.18]What about Otto?
[17:33.44]Do you honestly think that my dog is not coming with me?
[17:38.22]What are you talking about?
[17:39.44]Yeah, we can keep it going.
[17:44.84]Otto's going to go get his own place, I think.
[17:47.00]Otto's thinking about going and checking out some places.
[17:49.36]He was apartment hunting the other day.
[17:52.43]No, he's my dog!
[17:56.04]Anyways.
[17:57.60]Again, don't want to make a big deal about it because it's not a big deal at all.
[18:01.46]Not a big deal.
[18:02.06]Not a big deal.
[18:06.74]Are you and Otto still friends?
[18:10.89]Payments can be made using the ABD feature of the Nook Stop.
[18:14.01]I think that's everything I need to tell you about homes today.
[18:21.08]The auto is coming with me.
[18:22.18]I've said it like five times.
[18:25.24]I have a nice surprise for you.
[18:26.12]You're ready for this.
[18:28.18]It's a Premium Miles Redemption, a Nook Miles Ticket.
[18:32.45]Pretty sick.
[18:33.71]What is a Nook Miles Ticket?
[18:39.89]It's a conundrum.
[18:40.73]We want to improve our island, but still hold on to that deserted island magic.
[18:45.77]Well, now you can do both.
[18:47.17]You can use one of these tickets to do some island-hopping adventuring.
[18:50.01]Yes, just go anytime you want.
[18:51.49]You're looking to meet some new characters and gather materials for DIY projects.
[18:54.62]Excellent.
[18:55.78]Answer what question?
[18:56.40]Answer the question.
[18:56.92]What question?
[18:58.08]What question do you have?
[18:58.68]What are you talking about?
[19:00.52]Answer the question.
[19:00.92]I just did.
[19:01.76]What question do you have?
[19:03.20]You got me for 10 seconds.
[19:04.04]What question?
[19:04.42]What do you got?
[19:09.73]What about Shito?
[19:11.59]Yes.
[19:12.67]Are you in Auto Friends?
[19:13.61]Yes.
[19:17.42]Do you eat ass?
[19:20.78]I plead the fifth!
[19:23.88]Anything else?
[19:28.34]No, she's not.
[19:30.10]I'm not even gonna say it out loud.
[19:32.48]Are you still friends with Otto?
[19:33.52]Yes.
[19:35.38]Is Otto a dog?
[19:36.06]Yes.
[19:36.62]You got four more seconds.
[19:38.78]What about chat?
[19:39.52]You guys don't live in my house.
[19:41.97]So, I don't know.
[19:42.83]You won't be coming with me in my house.
[19:47.03]Any plans to... We don't?
[19:51.18]No, you don't... You don't live in my... No, you don't live in... You don't live here.
[19:57.78]You don't... None of you guys are here in this house.
[20:02.16]So how can I bring you to the new place?
[20:04.69]You don't occupy this house, this room here.
[20:09.19]Alright, fine.
[20:09.63]You ready?
[20:10.05]I'm turning the fucking digital vacuum on.
[20:11.61]I'm gonna... No, this is weird.
[20:12.85]This is weird.
[20:13.31]This is gonna get weird.
[20:13.97]I don't wanna do that.
[20:15.81]Alright, you got me for two more seconds.
[20:20.89]I'm not doing like a fucking Jerma sucks you up in a digital vacuum thing.
[20:24.23]Like, that's fucking weird.
[20:27.56]I don't like that.
[20:28.66]You like the Olive Garden?
[20:29.38]Of course I do.
[20:30.42]I especially love, out of all the things there, my favorite part about going to the Olive Garden has to be...
[20:36.84]Friday nights with my best friends.
[20:38.98]We have one rule.
[20:40.20]Everyone orders something different.
[20:41.98]Now, at Olive Garden, new smoked mozzarella chicken.
[20:44.64]Smoked mozzarella chicken.
[20:45.71]Topped with melted mozzarella.
[20:48.69]I'm actually fucking just doing ads for Olive Garden.
[20:51.01]This whole stream.
[20:53.19]That didn't even pay me any money or anything.
[20:54.65]Like, I'm doing this for no reason.
[20:57.75]I am, like, shouting out the fuck out of the Olive Garden for almost two straight hours.
[21:05.26]This is just for free.
[21:14.71]Whatever.
[21:15.03]He does it for breadsticks.
[21:18.59]By the way, they're endless.
[21:21.07]If you didn't know.
[21:23.37]I've got to play a game.
[21:27.56]Get the camera off.
[21:28.66]I've got to play a game.
[21:29.58]I'm playing a video game right now.
[21:33.50]Now then, go enjoy your life in the freshly built home.
[21:34.90]Wait, don't they have recycle?
[21:35.71]Alright, let's go.
[21:36.49]Camera on.
[21:36.73]No, no, it's late.
[21:37.15]It's getting late.
[21:54.30]No, I don't.
[21:55.60]I do not want to put the camera on.
[21:57.36]I think it's time to just kind of hang out and chill.
[22:01.46]Take out.
[22:01.92]I don't.
[22:02.42]I don't.
[22:02.72]The camera doesn't have to be on anymore.
[22:04.70]What's the point of the camera?
[22:05.36]What's the camera have to be on for every day?
[22:06.79]Doesn't have to be.
[22:07.83]The point.
[22:12.43]I can just not have the camera on when I don't feel like it.
[22:26.59]here we go let's play what's one of some chores I can do today oh somebody's like on the ground over there right wait I gotta go down here oh the game sound is muted I'm sorry I'm so sorry I'm sorry alright where's that person that was on the beach
[22:54.96]Get the bottle?
[22:55.50]I don't have any room for the bottle.
[22:56.54]I don't have any room.
[23:00.11]Oh, my pockets are full already.
[23:02.95]Just put it down.
[23:03.43]I don't have any room.
[23:04.13]I don't have any fucking room.
[23:08.40]What is this?
[23:09.18]Elephant slide.
[23:09.86]You know what?
[23:10.20]Just... What is this?
[23:15.98]Ooh.
[23:16.32]Ooh.
[23:20.76]Cool.
[23:20.86]Wooden full-length mirror.
[23:21.50]That's cool.
[23:22.58]Alright, okay.
[23:48.84]Let's go talk to the, uh, the new guy.
[23:52.14]Oh, Donald Duck.
[23:56.55]The waves, the waves are good.
[23:58.23]Already the pool noodles.
[23:59.89]I've asked storms to come and brace yourselves, lads.
[24:08.93]Hard to starboard, tough to port, stern to stern.
[24:15.88]Grr!
[24:18.96]Oh, it's not Donald Duck.
[24:19.86]It's Donald Pelican.
[24:21.88]Blur, do you have my pickled herring pizza?
[24:24.50]I already tipped online, so... Wait, I don't see a pizza.
[24:27.84]Where am I?
[24:28.34]Where are you?
[24:28.74]Who am I?
[24:29.42]Oh, hang on.
[24:29.78]I know that one.
[24:31.72]I'm none other than Gulliver, a seafaring seagull of the seven seas.
[24:36.85]Were you the one who kept nudging me just now?
[24:38.77]Thanks for the wake-up call.
[24:40.93]Those tasty hallucinations tend to sneak up on me.
[24:43.71]Have you found it any hard to forgive this waterlogged birdbrain?
[24:47.88]I'm reading your vacant expression as a yes.
[24:49.88]Phew.
[24:50.10]As I dozed off and tumbled overboard again.
[24:53.06]That's an endearing character trait of mine.
[24:56.10]My crewmates love it when I slip over the bow.
[24:58.26]Ha!
[24:59.18]Don't worry, the fellas will be here to rescue me in no time.
[25:02.52]Got an ace up my wing, you see.
[25:05.18]I'll just call for help using my handy dandy.
[25:09.10]Oh my.
[25:10.82]Oh my gosh.
[25:12.06]My handy dandy communicator is broken.
[25:13.48]This isn't handy or dandy.
[25:15.58]Oh, sardines.
[25:16.16]It's all cracked and busted.
[25:18.00]Looks like it's missing a few communicator parts.
[25:21.18]That means I'll have to wait for my crew to find me on their own.
[25:24.08]That could take a while.
[25:26.50]I've only got enough nautical puns to last a couple more hours.
[25:30.40]I'm begging you.
[25:30.84]Will you look for my communicator parts, please?
[25:33.70]Sure.
[25:37.42]So let me get this straight.
[25:38.28]This character is not in your game.
[26:07.06]But he's in mine.
[26:09.28]Right?
[26:10.66]That's possible.
[26:19.71]He shows up in everybody's.
[26:23.33]This one everyone gets.
[26:24.45]Oh, okay.
[26:26.65]There you are.
[26:27.25]Okay, let's give him some creatures.
[26:30.87]Could you be that you are Jeremy, the personage who chose a location for this tent?
[26:36.38]I am.
[26:49.08]Lend a job indeed, thanks to you, I was able to... I almost said... I thought I said... I... I was able to... I... I was able to get on here.
[26:56.30]Now, regarding the aforementioned research... Truth be told, I am determined to open a museum, and henceforth dwell on this island amongst you.
[27:03.18]If you discover any new types of insect or fish, come bring it here.
[27:08.22]I will exhibit them, as well as those you gave to Tom Nook.
[27:12.30]There's one small problem.
[27:13.62]I lack the number of exhibits needed to secure permission to open a museum proper.
[27:17.89]Anti-display cases will not do, I'm told.
[27:19.61]Display cases with something to display?
[27:20.75]That is another matter.
[27:21.63]Where are you coming?
[27:23.65]Allow me to explain.
[27:24.57]I need insects.
[27:27.21]It's not just insects and fish.
[27:29.09]I want fossils.
[27:31.09]This is a substantial stretch of land beyond the river.
[27:35.01]I would bet my pin feathers.
[27:36.57]This primitive plot is flush with the fossils I require.
[27:40.76]The river you say, I can't just go over it.
[27:42.52]Well, there's a boat.
[27:43.38]Get on one.
[27:46.40]Pardon me, Jeremy, while I transfer the vital data to your Nook phone.
[27:53.79]I want to, like, drink out of that.
[27:56.05]Anybody else want to drink out of that thing?
[27:58.41]There you see, with wood gathered from Saltcrest, one can make a legendary pole vault.
[28:03.55]This pole can be used to propel oneself across the river.
[28:06.94]Up and over you go.
[28:07.72]Hooty-hoo.
[28:10.23]I sent DIY schematics for a shovel.
[28:12.55]Dig fossils from the ground as well, which brings me to my point.
[28:15.99]Please, Jeremy, cross the river and seek out these ancient relics.
[28:19.18]My feathers have lathered on for too long, but let me leave you with this.
[28:22.70]Time to open the museum.
[28:24.84]I must acquire more items to exhibit 15.
[28:26.40]I hope you do it.
[28:28.80]Hey, look what I got.
[28:34.71]I have things to donate.
[28:37.23]Okay, so I have... Uh, take this moth.
[28:44.19]I got a bunch of shit outside, too.
[28:46.51]The repugnance.
[28:48.49]What happens if I maintain my composure?
[28:50.53]I beg your pardon.
[28:51.33]Bugs, I do detest them.
[28:52.59]Wait, aren't you... Don't you want them?
[28:57.08]Still, there's much I can tell you about the insect you apprehended.
[28:59.30]If you insist, that is.
[29:01.00]No.
[29:02.84]I know what a moth is.
[29:05.62]That's the joke!
[29:07.60]It was supposed to be funny, Jeremy.
[29:08.86]It was!
[29:09.06]I win.
[29:09.22]By the way, I wonder if you have anything else that could be donated.
[29:11.43]I do.
[29:11.83]Here, take this.
[29:13.83]A Prussian Carp.
[29:34.00]Any facts about the carp you wanna know?
[29:37.18]No.
[29:37.54]It's a fish.
[29:39.16]And it fucking eats algae.
[29:40.96]Cool.
[29:41.12]Eat 13 more.
[29:41.84]This dude's going feral?
[29:43.56]Why am I going feral?
[29:57.33]Hey, I will get plenty.
[29:58.75]You know what?
[29:59.25]I want... Oops, don't do that.
[30:02.31]Look at all these animals I have out here.
[30:05.46]Is it going to clean up?
[30:06.10]Okay, let's go.
[30:09.74]We will get the lore of the hermit crab, I promise.
[30:20.59]Why am I not an animal?
[30:26.85]A hermit crab.
[30:32.97]A hermit crab!
[30:33.47]Ugh, what a wretched thing!
[30:36.18]I don't like bugs.
[30:36.96]A hermit crab's not a bug.
[30:38.06]Hold on.
[30:39.48]A hermit crab is not a bug.
[30:44.22]It's like a crustacean.
[30:45.38]It's like a crab.
[30:46.22]It's not a bug.
[30:49.82]Tell me about it.
[30:52.38]In that case...
[30:55.12]A hermit crab is not an insect.
[30:56.38]Though it most certainly resembles one, bleh.
[30:59.62]It looks much like a spider, with its creepy eyes and crawly legs, but it is in fact a crustacean.
[31:04.77]As such, the hermit crab has ten legs and also wears a shell, but it doesn't grow this shell itself.
[31:09.87]It slips its soft body- I mean, we're reading a Wikipedia article about- It's like the first four lines of hermit crab entry.
[31:16.74]We don't need to do this.
[31:18.42]I know what a hermit crab is.
[31:19.28]Talk about a strange way to make- Anywho, thanks for the donation.
[31:28.09]Any more donations?
[31:30.38]I think I have one more, yeah?
[31:33.94]Yeah, take this bag worm.
[31:40.14]Let him do the job.
[31:40.88]He loves it.
[31:41.52]No, he hates it, apparently, because it doesn't like any of these things.
[31:45.47]Alright, you can read it.
[31:47.45]Here.
[31:49.09]It's a caterpillar.
[31:50.99]It uses silk...
[31:55.69]It's very cute.
[31:57.61]It dangles.
[32:00.89]They hide their bug bodies in leaves.
[32:03.77]They eat trees.
[32:04.33]And they're villains.
[32:05.75]Here we go.
[32:07.14]Okay.
[32:34.93]Let me in!
[32:36.19]Let me in!
[32:36.75]Blathers, I've got more things for you!
[32:41.83]Is Jerma's character the Joker?
[32:42.97]I got a lot of stuff.
[32:50.49]I only have bugs and shit.
[32:51.65]Alright, here's another centipede.
[33:02.95]Sure, let's find out.
[33:04.03]The centipede's name means 100 legs, but I tell you now, that's a lie.
[33:08.60]These ugly bugs can have as few as 15 pairs, or as many as 171.
[33:10.94]Because of how their bodies are segmented, they never have exactly 100.
[33:13.52]Ooh, it's true.
[33:29.11]You know what else is true?
[33:29.97]Centipedes are carnivorous, aggressive, and venomous.
[33:33.07]And their bite is quite painful, too.
[33:35.56]Horrible.
[33:37.36]Anywho, my sincerest thanks for your donation.
[33:40.96]No bugs are the bane of my existence.
[33:42.82]Thank you.
[33:44.30]Fun fact about centipedes.
[33:46.98]If you see a centipede, you're supposed to leave it alone.
[33:51.21]If the centipede is such an aggressive psycho, it will eat and kill all the other awful bugs that are even near your property.
[34:00.84]a centipede is like the ultimate ultimate hunter and they kill like scorpions and shit and spiders and just leave those motherfuckers alone let them just let them just wreak havoc on the pests that inhabit your house dude no one cares about centipedes
[34:27.68]I mean, don't... I didn't tell you to, like, to try to put your, like, touch your tongue on it.
[34:33.95]Just leave it alone.
[34:34.65]If it's in your house, just get it out of your house.
[34:36.89]But if you see one around your house, I don't know, just leave it alone.
[34:38.99]Alright, I gotta bring most stuff.
[34:43.69]Is this a fossil?
[34:47.22]Wait, that's another fossil?
[34:51.44]I need to get a shovel.
[34:52.14]Alright, back to the... Alright, I gotta go sell.
[35:02.07]It was one of my room last week.
[35:04.39]Yeah, and it probably- it probably wiped out the scary spider collection that may have been in your house.
[35:11.76]So you should just be thankful of the centipede.
[35:19.71]Hello!
[35:21.33]What would you like to talk to me about?
[35:22.41]Um... No, no, no, I'm good.
[35:24.71]Other person.
[35:25.43]Team Spider.
[35:34.41]Can I tell you?
[35:35.69]I saw the... I say the other day, but this is horseshit.
[35:40.08]It was probably like six months ago.
[35:42.90]I saw a fake widow, whatever they're called.
[35:47.78]They're called like fraud widows.
[35:50.78]They look like black widows.
[35:52.10]They're big.
[35:52.70]Their legs are so terrifying.
[35:53.86]It was terrifying.
[35:55.56]It was just outside.
[35:56.34]Those things are scary.
[35:59.78]They're scary.
[36:04.14]It's a fraud.
[36:05.04]Yeah, it's actually called, like, fraud widow.
[36:07.60]A bit of a proposal.
[36:12.39]I want to make a proposal.
[36:14.05]Sure.
[36:17.33]I'm hoping that you might be interested in collaborating on a new venture, building a new shop.
[36:22.11]After all, our island community is growing and our needs are growing, too.
[36:24.21]I'd love to offer a much wider inventory of goods, but as you can see, I'm a bit limited here.
[36:29.04]I spoke with our fearless leader.
[36:30.64]He agrees that we have a need.
[36:31.84]That's the thing, building materials are hard to get, so can we set them aside for building a shop?
[36:35.51]I really don't see it.
[36:37.31]Since we'll need those materials for residential projects, but I have an idea.
[36:40.97]Yes, yes, yes.
[36:42.21]You could gather up materials from around the island, right from the trees and the rocks.
[36:46.21]Our environmental review even suggests that there will be zero impact to native flora or fauna.
[36:51.51]False widow spider.
[36:52.50]There it is.
[36:55.52]I'm getting drunk.
[36:57.46]We'll need a lot of materials for a proper shop.
[36:59.54]So bringing wood and stuff.
[37:01.25]Yeah, well, we'll do it.
[37:02.21]Here's the items.
[37:02.89]30 pieces of wood.
[37:06.17]Wait, 90?
[37:06.29]30 iron nuggets and 90 pieces of different wood.
[37:08.23]Okay.
[37:08.41]Holy shit, man.
[37:27.22]Alright, well, here.
[37:27.68]I want to sell... Here, take this.
[37:30.13]I want to sell.
[37:33.67]Let's get rid of these.
[37:38.89]These.
[37:39.17]What else should I get rid of?
[37:46.46]I don't know what else to sell.
[37:52.82]Sell the weed?
[37:53.38]Oh, I'm going to keep the weed.
[37:55.60]Sell the nest, too.
[37:58.42]I guess so.
[38:03.82]1,400 bells.
[38:06.38]I've got money in the bank.
[38:10.57]Look, I've got money in the bank.
[38:21.05]I've got $5,500 in the bank.
[38:22.45]Loan payment.
[38:24.03]Pay from savings.
[38:25.86]Let's do $2,000 on to our loan.
[38:30.48]Cool.
[38:35.18]When am I going to play Odama next?
[38:39.50]I'm not playing that game again.
[38:46.85]You'll never see that game again.
[38:49.55]Not happening.
[38:55.83]Okay, so I need to find... I need to make a shovel.
[39:00.29]Let's take and make a shovel.
[39:02.53]Let's collect some stuff first.
[39:03.66]Let me go to the... There was a rock down here.
[39:05.02]Let me hit the rock.
[39:05.84]Made a bunch of wood, too.
[39:10.04]Each tree has three wood.
[39:11.40]Is that three wood a day?
[39:12.26]I might be able to do the shop thing today.
[39:25.46]Probably not.
[39:28.76]The wood's the easy part, yeah.
[39:30.10]Oh, I need the iron.
[39:39.93]Should I talk to Phoebe?
[39:41.45]Yo, Jeremy!
[39:44.41]Hold on.
[39:44.91]I'll have time for you in a minute.
[39:47.73]Get out of my way!
[39:48.53]Get out!
[39:49.85]Stop!
[39:53.40]Get the fuck out of my way.
[39:54.82]I've got stuff to do.
[39:56.02]Oh my god.
[39:56.94]You've ruined everything.
[40:02.81]Cool.
[40:03.21]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[40:04.11]Nice.
[40:04.31]Thank you.
[40:04.65]Thank you.
[40:04.93]Thank you.
[40:05.29]Cool.
[40:05.59]Thanks for the lunch.
[40:07.09]I'm figuring out how to make a lunch.
[40:08.81]Okay, cool.
[40:09.87]You can make a shovel now.
[40:10.99]Thank you.
[40:11.29]There's gold over there.
[40:12.77]Okay, thank you.
[40:21.34]I'm rude?
[40:22.24]I only have about five seconds to hit this stuff.
[40:24.58]Thanks for this.
[40:25.24]Thanks for that.
[40:28.04]I'm so rude.
[40:28.80]No, I'm clearly working and they got in my way.
[40:31.97]You don't go walk up to a guy swinging an axe and go, hey, I have a question for you.
[40:35.33]Is my face too close to your backswing?
[40:37.19]Get out of here.
[40:53.54]That was rude.
[40:54.08]I just gave you a shovel.
[40:56.82]Be more fucking grateful.
[41:00.10]Hey, now you're being rude to me.
[41:06.33]It's a never-ending cycle of rudeness.
[41:13.25]Shit.
[41:16.75]I'll see you guys next week for the City of Heroes stream.
[41:20.49]That'll be fun.
[41:23.15]We're going to work together.
[41:25.03]We're going to have a superhero group of like 4,000 of us.
[41:27.97]It'll be cool.
[41:30.81]It'll be fun.
[41:38.97]Gold nugget.
[41:39.67]Nice.
[41:39.87]Alright, what's it take to make a shovel?
[41:45.31]Here, I'll talk to you.
[41:46.05]I'm sorry.
[41:46.87]Am I being pranked?
[41:50.34]Is there a hidden camera?
[41:51.92]Let's talk.
[41:54.62]That game is dead.
[41:55.68]Mega lull.
[42:01.58]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[42:02.64]The game doesn't even turn on?
[42:05.53]Is the servers gone?
[42:07.97]The servers are gone.
[42:08.69]I can't even play.
[42:13.39]He's a fan server.
[42:15.19]Okay.
[42:19.39]There's a fan server.
[42:20.29]Well, I don't want to diarrhea all over somebody's fan server with like 5,000 fucking accounts made on it.
[42:28.25]I'm not going to do that.
[42:31.17]You better invite me over soon.
[42:40.97]Did I learn the shovel?
[42:42.75]DIY?
[42:45.61]Play champions online.
[42:57.74]Here we go.
[42:58.69]It's hardwood.
[42:59.91]Shovel!
[43:04.49]Let's have a sleepover.
[43:06.55]God.
[43:09.98]Ooh!
[43:10.46]Wait, I can make all this stuff.
[43:13.46]I'm gonna make a little table.
[43:18.70]And we're gonna make a mirror.
[43:21.29]I have to have furniture in my house.
[43:34.51]Alright, that's good for now.
[43:37.29]Okay.
[43:39.39]Nook miles.
[43:40.47]What did I get?
[43:42.51]I actually have a lot of miles.
[43:44.17]5,000 is the inventory upgrade, right?
[43:49.91]Furniture.
[43:56.47]Flower tender.
[44:00.34]Almost at the inventory upgrade.
[44:04.76]Very cool.
[44:06.58]Okay.
[44:07.26]I need to make another axe.
[44:12.36]Do I have enough for an axe?
[44:14.98]Yep.
[44:15.94]That's a net.
[44:16.50]That's not an axe.
[44:17.24]Okay.
[44:27.06]Do the pole.
[44:27.60]Oh yeah, the pole vault, right?
[44:33.27]New vaulting pole.
[44:36.55]Pockets are twofold.
[44:38.63]Shit.
[44:39.41]Um... I gotta get all... Hold on.
[44:55.21]Oh, I gotta get this stuff in my house.
[44:56.61]Okay, I gotta deposit some shit.
[45:00.08]Be right back.
[45:13.57]Okay, so mirror.
[45:16.03]Uh, turn the lights back on.
[45:18.90]Wooden full-length mirror.
[45:21.52]Nice.
[45:22.38]What can I do with it?
[45:24.24]Can I change up my look?
[45:26.84]Wait, what do you mean change up my look?
[45:30.26]Oh, you can change your haircut and stuff?
[45:33.18]That's kind of cool.
[45:37.84]Oh, that's cool.
[45:38.34]Alright.
[45:41.34]Uh, little table.
[45:44.59]Nice.
[45:45.63]And a elephant slide.
[46:02.36]Put the elephant slide down here.
[46:05.82]I'll plant an apple.
[46:08.86]Actually, I'll plant two apple trees.
[46:10.08]Why not?
[46:16.56]Alright, this looks like a fucking temple.
[46:21.40]World of Slides.
[46:22.74]Alright, now... I wanna go back, make the pole, and go across the river?
[46:37.52]The people want 30 minute slow mode.
[46:41.70]I don't think they do.
[46:42.42]I'm not sure they do.
[46:53.72]Okay.
[46:55.79]It begins.
[46:57.29]So, I want to go help Donald duck first.
[47:01.79]I'll head down there.
[47:02.33]Because I can dig on the beach, right?
[47:05.89]Wait.
[47:15.51]Come on.
[47:24.60]That kind of was a bad haul.
[47:30.58]Sub-optimal grinding.
[47:31.98]How am I gonna do 30 minutes slow-mo?
[47:37.82]No, why would I do that?
[47:40.10]Flimsy shovel and shovel.
[47:42.56]What?
[47:57.40]Okay, so I have to do... Look for holes, things to dig on the beach?
[48:02.44]Oh, the bird gave me the shovel.
[48:05.30]Didn't you say my stuff's on the beach?
[48:09.31]Pole vault over here?
[48:10.01]How do you pole vault?
[48:23.70]So you said use the shovel on the rock.
[48:39.40]Damn.
[48:41.10]Wow.
[48:42.38]Well, that was... Holy shit, that one had like 4,000.
[49:04.03]Dig a hole behind you so you don't get recoiled.
[49:08.88]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[49:12.30]Come back here.
[49:26.21]That thing was huge.
[49:35.57]There's an enemy spider.
[49:37.61]Uh, how do I use the pole vault?
[49:38.67]It has to be equipped?
[49:50.77]Oh, hold it.
[49:54.99]Alright, nice.
[49:55.63]Here we go.
[49:59.17]Here we go.
[50:00.13]Here we go.
[50:03.04]Complete.
[50:08.75]Oh, I can plant.
[50:09.25]Okay, I'm going to plant apple trees over here.
[50:11.11]Yeah, I'm going to plant some trees here.
[50:15.52]Okay.
[50:27.36]Apples.
[50:28.22]Plant.
[50:30.77]Cool.
[50:30.97]And then we do, uh, how far apart do they have to be?
[50:34.77]Does it matter?
[50:35.43]How far apart can I do it?
[50:36.69]Whatever.
[50:38.53]Will this work?
[50:39.25]Can I do it here?
[50:39.65]I can do it right there, right?
[50:45.03]It doesn't matter?
[50:45.73]It just does?
[50:46.17]Okay, cool.
[50:51.86]I have an apple garden.
[50:55.02]Just at least one space.
[50:56.10]Okay.
[51:04.57]Do I have to water them?
[51:05.13]I would assume, right?
[51:12.65]Trees don't need water.
[51:13.48]Oh, okay.
[51:20.34]Am I going to play Smite after this?
[51:25.50]That's something I haven't heard in a very, very, very long time.
[51:33.83]Dude, you're gonna play Smite after this.
[51:35.45]Alright, I'm gonna... I'm gonna make... Okay, I have three apple trees.
[51:48.89]Oh, shit.
[51:49.27]There's a lot of stuff over here.
[51:51.53]Crap.
[51:51.87]I already have one of those, though.
[51:53.89]I don't even want it.
[51:54.55]That's a huge fish.
[52:00.88]Huge fish.
[52:01.36]I don't have any money.
[52:04.56]I gotta get that space upgrade.
[52:05.82]Alright, do I have enough for the upgrade?
[52:08.82]I think I do.
[52:12.40]It's 5,000, right?
[52:17.67]Come on.
[52:22.75]Come on, 500.
[52:24.69]Ah, so close.
[52:30.75]What do I need to get there?
[52:33.69]I need... That's an easy one.
[52:37.50]Just take a picture.
[52:38.82]Alright, just take any photo.
[52:40.04]Alright, I'm gonna go get the inventory upgrade.
[52:58.24]That's the plan.
[53:07.11]Boomer selfie.
[53:07.97]I don't know why I'm laughing at that, because I don't even know what that means.
[53:13.55]Check the bulletin board.
[53:14.20]What's this?
[53:17.08]Free stuff tomorrow only at Tom Nook's house.
[53:19.34]Just go in, it's fine.
[53:20.38]Take anything.
[53:21.06]Signed, Tom Nook.
[53:22.92]Well, that's... That's today.
[53:24.82]That's still valid?
[53:27.99]Is it still open?
[53:42.40]5000 miles.
[53:48.20]A pocket organization guide.
[53:49.88]I will take it.
[53:52.78]Thank you.
[53:53.08]Are we actually on 30 minute slow mode?
[53:57.49]Why?
[53:59.57]We should not be on 30 minute slow mode.
[54:04.55]I don't want to be on 30 minute slow mode.
[54:11.76]I learned some tricks for organizing my belongings.
[54:13.54]I can carry a bit more stuff.
[54:16.18]Holy shit, that's so much better.
[54:17.50]Oh, I can actually breathe.
[54:22.76]Is it almond or wifi?
[54:24.42]Uh, it's wifi.
[54:34.21]Freedom.
[54:34.81]Wait, it was actually on.
[54:42.12]Alright, now I have some room for this shit.
[54:45.20]And then I want to store the other things.
[54:48.30]I need storage.
[54:48.88]What do I do?
[54:51.30]Oh, up here.
[55:05.79]Back.
[55:07.49]You just- you have the ability to speak now and you want it taken away from you?
[55:11.09]Why do you want that?
[55:12.75]You don't actually want that.
[55:17.29]You sound like a cam girl when she reads messages.
[55:23.07]I don't even- I have no- what the fuck does that even mean?
[55:33.62]Actua- what?
[55:36.29]I don't even know what that means!
[55:37.43]What are you talking about?
[55:43.05]True though, that's true, true, it's true, true, true, true, true, true, true, true.
[55:45.93]What?
[55:47.39]The fuck are you talking about?
[55:50.21]I don't even, I don't even know what that reference is.
[55:51.93]It's a reference to... I know what, I know what it is.
[55:56.61]I don't know what you, what are you, what did I say?
[56:02.29]It's so true, it's true.
[56:08.88]Hold on.
[56:09.18]What are you talking about?
[56:27.53]I think it's just how people read messages in general.
[56:33.45]I got dressed for this shit.
[56:35.19]I don't even know.
[56:36.47]What does that mean?
[56:40.43]Earlier, I don't want to use face cam.
[56:47.02]Look at me.
[56:49.76]Naked frame.
[56:52.40]Play Smite.
[56:59.45]The people have spoken.
[57:00.53]The people have spoken.
[57:01.87]Play Nancy Drew while you swallow a disc of Smite.
[57:06.54]Installation disc one of four.
[57:19.87]I am going- I didn't even store my items!
[57:26.63]Store your shit.
[57:27.45]I know, I'm being distracted by people saying things about me.
[57:31.69]They're saying things about me.
[57:34.43]Oh, they're saying things about me.
[57:35.63]Alright, store this.
[57:44.70]Store this.
[57:47.68]Store the clay.
[57:50.32]store the stones stones yes I'll I'll get the stones yes my lord I will I will get the stones I don't need any of this other shit
[58:24.32]Can you imagine?
[58:25.82]Can you imagine not seeing a bunch of movies and not knowing what the fifth element is?
[58:31.04]Imagine not seeing a bunch of movies.
[58:32.60]You took the Universal fucking Studios quiz.
[58:35.18]You don't know movies?
[58:36.18]Imagine?
[58:48.18]Imagine?
[58:53.32]Alright, so... I need to go on a quest.
[59:00.88]I need to watch more movies.
[59:02.49]What's a stack of fruits?
[59:12.60]What's one stack of fruits?
[59:13.78]10?
[59:13.80]20? 30?
[59:20.11]Ooh, look at those up there.
[59:23.30]Rock.
[59:23.70]40.
[59:28.38]I feel like that's different from the last one.
[59:30.48]Alright, I hear somebody... This is a strategy, right?
[59:34.20]You do one behind you so you can't be bounced back?
[59:36.52]Is this the strategy?
[59:38.67]It is.
[59:43.51]Oh, you fucking can't be serious.
[59:55.27]I got some iron, though.
[60:00.37]Botched it.
[60:04.46]Okay, no more... What's over here?
[60:05.74]Lots of stuff.
[60:09.68]No, stop that.
[60:10.14]I want to just shake it.
[60:12.25]Two diagonally, but I need two holes.
[60:13.87]Okay.
[60:20.91]Oh, back seating.
[60:24.41]I distinctly saw three peaches drop, and only one of them was collectible.
[60:34.17]What's that?
[60:36.75]I dug up a fossil.
[60:37.75]Ooh, cool.
[60:41.31]Any fish in here?
[60:41.92]This is worth 20, but it's rare.
[60:55.90]Everything is rare in this game, don't you know?
[61:01.84]I make a lot of money from the peaches.
[61:03.04]It's worth $90,000.
[61:13.53]What?
[61:28.56]This time I'm ready.
[61:32.92]Got ya.
[61:35.48]Don't touch it!
[61:36.00]I caught a tarantula.
[61:37.78]The situation just got hairy.
[61:42.62]I'm gonna get... let's get some more fish.
[61:44.58]Bring to the... the guy.
[62:03.15]I caught a loach.
[62:07.07]Looking at me with reproach.
[62:12.83]Already got this one.
[62:14.81]What else is on this little island?
[62:16.14]Ooh, two more spots.
[62:17.36]Nice.
[62:21.88]Fossil.
[62:24.78]Fossil and... Two more fossils.
[62:33.45]This game is terrible for joke stonks.
[62:39.19]Yeah, but we gotta remember, sometimes it's not about the jokes.
[62:45.35]Sometimes it's about shaking trees and picking up apples on the ground.
[62:52.42]Sometimes it's not about the jokes.
[62:55.75]Sometimes it's about sending a message.
[62:59.75]Why did you just make me do that?
[63:03.18]It's always about the jokes.
[63:04.34]It's not always about the jokes.
[63:05.48]Sometimes it's about just... It's not always about the joke.
[63:12.80]Look, if it was only joke, I could get joke exhaustion.
[63:29.32]Alright, well, I got a bunch of stuff.
[63:30.16]Let's go talk to the, uh, wait.
[63:32.26]Z. It's a sentient rock.
[63:46.02]Wouldn't that be something?
[63:56.10]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[63:58.60]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[63:59.62]Can you eat the grass?
[64:02.05]I'm going to Blathers.
[64:20.62]Balloon present.
[64:21.38]Balloon present.
[64:22.10]Balloon alert.
[64:22.76]Attention streamer.
[64:23.60]I wasn't looking.
[64:28.39]Where was it?
[64:41.55]What's in it?
[64:42.45]Hopefully it's a fossil.
[64:45.11]Bunch of clay.
[64:46.03]Eh, that's pretty good.
[64:46.75]I only had one.
[65:04.00]Rare clay.
[65:07.30]Nice.
[65:09.46]Alright Blathers, I got some fossils for you.
[65:13.54]I do.
[65:15.18]Take this.
[65:20.38]Has he dusted off?
[65:23.04]We know that this is a fossil.
[65:24.54]Incredible, wonderful, remarkable.
[65:25.96]My intuition was impeccable.
[65:27.75]There are fossils on this island.
[65:30.37]I wonder, would you perhaps consider donating this to the cause?
[65:32.43]Yes!
[65:57.87]I'll add this to the collection.
[65:59.35]I will add your light shapers to my collection.
[66:02.73]I never thought I'd say I lay eyes on this bunch of preserved left Mijello side.
[66:08.20]Dear me, I might have to give you a short presentation on the topic.
[66:12.80]Oh, no.
[66:15.04]Uh, sure.
[66:18.76]Wonderful.
[66:19.24]This is fascinating stuff.
[66:20.18]I assure you.
[66:20.66]Now, where do we go?
[66:23.01]The Megalosaurus was a relative of the deer that lived during the Ice Age, long after the dinosaurs.
[66:28.91]It was also known as Megaloceros giganteos, which just means deer with large horns.
[66:35.22]True to their name, they were deer with antlers spanning roughly 10 feet across.
[66:38.20]Imagine the majesty.
[66:41.08]While smaller than many dinosaurs, they were nonetheless a very charismatic example of megafauna.
[66:47.08]And that is what I have to say about that.
[66:48.28]Anywho, I'll take it.
[66:51.28]He's doing it on purpose.
[66:52.94]He has to be doing it on purpose.
[66:54.66]He has to be!
[66:59.54]Omegalosaurus.
[67:04.22]Only a specialist can appraise a newly discovered fossil.
[67:11.57]Whether you choose to donate is up to you.
[67:13.79]I will assess it.
[67:14.41]Okay.
[67:21.74]What about this bug?
[67:26.98]A tarantula!
[67:28.16]Let's learn.
[67:31.47]In that case... As far as go, the tarantula is said to be quite docile, but have you ever seen such foul fuzziness?
[67:44.02]They're barbed, I tell you.
[67:45.76]These awful arachnids let loose their spiky, itchy hairs to protect themselves from predators.
[67:49.98]But seeing how tarantulas also prey on frogs, mice, and even birds, one must ask, who needs protecting from whom?
[67:57.49]Who indeed?
[67:58.17]Anywho, my sincerest thanks.
[68:01.21]They eat frogs.
[68:02.19]That's true.
[68:02.67]They do.
[68:02.91]That's fucked up.
[68:08.81]I got this thing.
[68:17.62]A loach?
[68:18.72]Uh, I don't care.
[68:19.40]So hold on, the fossil that I dug up, that, uh, that, that, uh, the Magellan stone, whatever it was called, is it that, can I now sell that?
[68:29.22]Is that, I don't have to give it to him anymore?
[68:30.58]Cool.
[68:48.86]You can still have to get it again.
[68:51.16]Place it.
[68:54.52]Place the fossil.
[68:59.47]Please donate.
[68:59.97]Why do you have... Why do I place it?
[69:04.83]Place it, like, up here?
[69:11.61]Outside.
[69:12.21]On the ground?
[69:14.44]I already donated it.
[69:24.55]Keep giving him fossils.
[69:25.77]I couldn't select it.
[69:29.55]You get it again.
[69:30.31]No, you did not.
[69:31.21]What?
[69:32.19]When I... All the fossils were grayed out when I just talked to him.
[69:34.83]What are you talking about?
[69:40.15]Wait, he has to assess the fossil first, then you can donate it.
[69:52.34]Assess fossils.
[69:53.39]Okay.
[69:56.21]Here, look at this.
[69:58.83]Take them both.
[70:01.15]Sometimes it's automatically donated.
[70:02.67]What do we got?
[70:08.64]These are rare fossils.

[87:34.90]Hit us with the facts.
[87:37.74]Red Snapper is the common name of dozens of fish species, and I wonder why it's so popular.
[87:40.96]Are there so many types of fish that are both a shade of red and have a tendency to snap?
[87:45.54]Were there no other names?
[87:48.32]What about... Uh, Garnet Grasper?
[87:51.24]Fuse Pinscher?

[95:14.27]I'm sorry.
[95:16.85]I shouldn't have opened up the bag of flour in here.
[95:19.35]That was a mistake.
[95:22.43]Achoo!
[95:25.16]Gah!
[95:28.18]What happens if you sneeze?
[95:29.52]What happens?
[95:29.86]Does anybody know what happens?
[95:30.74]Does anybody know what happens if you sneeze like ten times in a row?
[95:36.73]What happens if you sneeze like ten times in a row?
[95:39.61]I can't... 20!
[95:40.45]Gah!
[95:59.00]Fuck!
[96:00.88]Oh, no, is there any more?
[96:02.32]This is the most times I've sneezed in my entire life!
[96:09.83]Okay, I think they're gone.
[96:16.98]I think that's it.
[96:17.50]I don't think there are any more in here.
[96:24.68]Jesus.
[96:28.14]Okay, so what I was saying was... I saw the Star Wars movie and it was... I mean, it was okay.
[96:35.66]If you... Fuck!
[96:38.28]I'm okay now, I think.
[96:55.52]It's the worst movie, very topical.
[97:01.22]Did you lost 150 viewers?
[97:02.98]It's alright, they'll be back tomorrow!
[97:05.76]I'm a fucking psycho, I gotta relax.
[97:13.70]Okay, what's next?
[97:21.55]Am I out of stuff to do?
[97:23.56]No, I... Oh, wait a minute.
[97:25.84]Uh, I need one more fossil and one more... I gotta get... Let me go get a fish.
[97:33.61]And then the airport.
[97:34.37]Yeah.
[97:35.53]Let me get this last fish and then we can figure that out.
[97:38.94]Where's my fishing rod?
[97:39.88]God, this game is so good.
[97:41.68]Alright, I took it off.
[97:46.76]Um... Can I... How do I put it on my thing?
[97:52.30]Register.
[97:53.08]Yes.
[97:54.67]Okay, good.
[98:03.25]Badger sneezes were real?
[98:04.43]Well, that's not worth anything.
[98:09.79]That old tire could be repurposed.
[98:11.13]I've got an idea for a DIY project?
[98:16.80]Wait.
[98:18.12]That's kind of cool, really?
[98:29.96]Let's see a fish I haven't seen.
[98:30.70]No, I've already seen this.
[98:39.97]Wait.
[98:41.03]Points.
[98:53.89]I probably need to go this way and go to the river.
[98:57.17]I want a rare fish.
[99:02.88]It's weird, he does that sometimes when I'm watching the streams.
[99:06.74]He does that fake Boston accent, almost like he's pretending that he's from the area that he's actually from.
[99:12.75]Does anybody know why he's doing that?
[99:14.97]Enter.
[99:16.93]Question mark.
[99:38.61]Oh, it's a flounder!
[99:40.41]I caught a dab, not bad.
[99:41.67]That's the name of a fish?
[99:49.42]Well, there's the last thing to give to the... Museum.
[99:57.56]Looking for bugs?
[99:58.42]Okay, no bugs.
[99:59.04]Alright, let's do the museum, and then I'm gonna do the the airline ticket thing.
[100:07.65]Actually, it's called a nose wipe.
[100:08.86]Yeah, sorry.
[100:09.58]I misspoke.
[100:24.26]Wait, did I do this one?
[100:25.48]Yeah, I did, right?
[100:26.08]Yeah.
[100:27.64]It's a pretty fucking cool looking house.
[100:28.82]I wonder whose that is.
[100:38.18]I don't know why you're nominating that for worst joke taking more than five minutes.
[100:41.70]Like, I see the title a little that way.
[100:45.25]You don't think I can see what clips are being made?
[100:47.29]I can see it over there.
[101:00.95]Assess this.
[101:02.74]Wait, I don't have any bosses, do I?
[101:06.76]I'd like to make a donation.
[101:07.62]I'd like to make a donation.
[101:11.92]And then the museum can open.
[101:14.50]Probably tomorrow.
[101:16.74]This is a dab.
[101:19.00]Let's get... Actually, let's get some facts.
[101:23.39]The dab is a flatfish that bears some resemblance to the olive flounder.
[101:27.98]The olive flarden.
[101:29.70]Though their mouths are different, personally, I'm morbidly fascinated by each fish's eye placement.
[101:35.38]The dab's eyes are both on its right side, while the olive flounder's are on the left.
[101:41.33]These fish spend lots of time lying on their sides in the sand, so the odd eye placement makes some sense.
[101:46.37]Let's talk about this creepy, incredibly disturbing, profoundly upsetting defense.
[101:53.56]And there you have it.
[101:54.36]Grasping stuff.
[101:55.50]Bravo.
[101:56.90]Once the museum is complete, it shall be displayed with the utmost dignity.
[102:02.22]I do believe this means, yes, we have acquired the number of specimens required.
[102:05.08]I'm fed as I am a loss for words.
[102:07.50]Never would I have imagined we could reach our donation goal on this, my very first day on the island.
[102:13.87]Generosity that made this possible.
[102:15.31]The passion I am humbled by.
[102:16.31]The spirit of Saltrest Mountain.
[102:21.01]Now we can submit our application to build a proper museum.
[102:23.87]Oh, I must make haste.
[102:25.97]I gotta prepare all this shit, dude.
[102:27.81]There's an opening.
[102:28.53]I gotta be ready to open tomorrow.
[102:29.69]There's so much to do.
[102:30.39]Let's go.
[102:31.07]Thank you so much, Jeremy.
[102:31.91]Alright.
[102:44.08]Done.
[102:45.32]Done.
[102:46.08]Both tasks completed.
[102:48.12]In record time.
[102:50.36]Now, we go to the airport.
[102:55.66]Holy shit, he's chasing me!
[102:58.16]What do I do?
[103:00.00]Okay, I'm gonna turn around.
[103:02.20]Phoebe, do something!
[103:02.98]Phoebe!
[103:03.80]Phoebe, do you have any... Get the fuck out of here.
[103:10.27]That was bait the whole time.
[103:11.51]I had confidence the entire time.
[103:12.81]Now I'm gonna sell this little... Fuck.
[103:27.05]Wait, can I just have- Wait, what if I just keep it in my house?
[103:40.32]I'm gonna have a pet spider now.
[103:45.92]Can I play- Oh my god, it's a friend!
[103:47.96]It's a friend!
[103:49.36]His friend showed up.
[103:52.60]Oh my god, I'm so scared!
[103:53.52]Oh my god, oh my god, what do I do?
[103:54.86]What do I-
[104:00.03]Fuck, I was trying to go for a tooth.
[104:05.89]It didn't work twice, it's okay.
[104:16.14]But, here we go.
[104:16.90]So, tarantula.
[104:19.98]Show it off!
[104:22.80]Ah!
[104:25.34]Place.
[104:25.62]There's no- wait, what do you mean there's no room?
[104:28.42]I can't put it on the table?
[104:33.83]Yes!
[104:37.15]Wow.
[104:43.32]It's just you and me.
[104:44.28]This is so cool.
[104:54.25]Wait, here.
[104:59.87]Okay, come on.
[105:00.63]What do you want to watch?
[105:02.65]Oh, you can watch it on Switch, whatever you want.
[105:11.39]Put on anything.
[105:20.27]Small... He's gonna binge Rocket Power.
[105:24.79]I come back in.
[105:26.62]Watch history is like...
[105:30.09]Every single, every single fucking season, every single episode of, like... Doctor Who has just been watched.
[105:38.62]Of all, like, 20 years of the series.
[105:40.96]Okay, so now, uh, go just, do I just go to the airport?
[105:56.29]What a mediocre show.
[105:58.09]I think what you just said right there, I'm 99% certain that somebody's going to scream in your face because you said that.
[106:05.25]You know what I'm saying?
[106:09.08]Like, I would... Someone's probably going to scream at you.
[106:13.74]Where am I going?
[106:14.46]Where's the airport?
[106:16.12]Down here.
[106:27.12]So what can I do?
[106:27.58]I can go to a mystery island?
[106:33.56]Doctor Who bad.
[106:34.44]Doctor Who bad.

[106:46.32]Dodo Airlines, the crew may be flightless, but that doesn't mean you have to be.

[107:06.68]By the way, you're Jeremy, right?
[107:10.06]It's a small island.
[107:11.16]Word gets around.
[107:12.98]I just got a Nook Miles ticket from Tom Nook with Jeremy written on it, which makes it yours.
[107:19.45]So if you want to use this ticket, you just gotta say the magic words.
[107:22.67]I wanna fly.

[107:26.19]So, Jeremy.
[107:28.25]You got anything to tell me?
[107:30.67]Thank you, guy on Fiverr, for your voice acting that I paid for.

[108:01.57]I will ruin my whole game.
[108:04.63]I want to fly.
[108:07.80]People are gonna come out here and just start throwing grass on the ground.
[108:10.90]They're gonna do like the Dark Souls thing.

[108:59.50]I'll visit somebody from chat.
[109:03.61]No, I don't want anyone to- I don't want to visit somebody from chat.
[109:05.87]They can like reverse fucking Google image search my game and find my game.
[109:09.15]I'm not doing- no.
[109:20.08]True.
[109:21.08]He knows.

[109:29.39]He's fucking scary.
[109:31.13]I would never be able to have a tarantula for a pet.
[109:33.27]Never in a million years.
[109:43.44]They're just scary.
[109:45.40]I'll be honest.
[109:47.21]I know they're not.
[109:48.15]And I know that's me just being... That's bullshit.

[111:41.67]And then there's a whole group of people in another house that want one person to go over to that other person's house.
[111:49.11]Dude, go to that person's house.

[117:44.12]Salt Crest Airport.
[117:47.25]I want to fly.
[117:48.51]Let's go to Mystery Island.
[117:59.22]Loop the sneeze for three hours.
[118:00.40]People would leave.
[118:02.26]They really would.
[118:02.82]I mean, we make jokes, but people would actually be like, I'm never coming back again.
[118:07.87]Time for takeoff.
[118:11.07]Did you delete almond or Wi-Fi?
[118:12.43]Yes, I did.
[118:19.69]Dodo 1, this is Dodo Tower.
[118:20.81]Wilbert.
[118:21.65]You copy?
[118:22.45]Got a walker who needs wings.
[118:25.24]Roger.
[118:25.58]We got... How much time do I have on here?
[118:30.76]Is this a limited amount of time here?
[118:40.99]Don't worry, two down and dock to the target.
[118:45.41]First time getting your pontoons wet on tour, let me brief you on the mystery island.
[118:50.05]First, we run the finders keepers protocol here, lumber, fruit, fish, whatever, yours if you can carry it.
[118:56.62]Next up, break a tool, forget one, I can requisition for you a replacement, gotta charge you miles though.
[119:01.16]If there's one red line item you need to memorize, like your favorite latte order, anything you leave behind stays here, we don't come back to these places.
[119:11.96]Actually, burn the flight plans afterwards.
[119:13.42]Security reasons.
[119:14.08]Can't explain that.
[119:14.86]Kylo Ren.
[119:15.10]No.
[119:15.24]Go catch some bees.
[119:34.89]Oh, wow.
[119:35.67]Holy shit, look at these flowers.
[119:38.95]What?
[119:39.25]What?
[119:39.49]I can just take them?
[119:45.48]Why can I just take everything?
[119:55.48]Holy shit.
[119:56.64]It's all free.
[120:13.44]Let me get this right.
[120:14.78]Okay, that's good.
[120:44.58]Use the shovel on the flowers.
[120:52.52]What the fuck?
[120:53.28]What's the difference?
[120:56.78]Oh, it's like the actual plant.
[121:03.75]Use the shovel.
[121:04.57]I know I see the cow.
[121:06.07]I'm trying not to get that excited about it.
[121:08.89]Trying to stay grounded.
[121:17.98]I just take them all?
[121:25.80]No, I don't want this... This is deft.
[121:30.15]Well, is it deft if they just told... The guy just told me on the dock.
[121:33.85]Take everything you can carry.
[121:35.31]I see a stink bug.
[121:38.95]I missed it.
[121:39.65]And I'm fucking furious.
[121:43.53]How could I be so stupid?
[121:44.85]How could I mess that up?
[121:52.26]I can sell this stuff, can't I?
[122:03.36]Sneeze alert.
[122:08.94]What do you mean, sneeze alert?
[122:11.44]Wait, okay, hold on.
[122:12.26]So, you're talking about, I just need to do this.
[122:14.34]Like that?
[122:16.54]Is this gonna work?
[122:38.16]Very cool.
[122:43.41]Ow.
[122:48.07]He gets it, he gets it, he gets it, I do know.
[122:49.73]Are those coconuts?
[122:51.91]Ooh, fresh coconuts.
[122:54.55]I'm gonna make a, can I plant a coconut tree?
[122:57.63]I hope so.
[123:00.65]Pugs.
[123:01.55]No, those are dumb.
[123:02.33]I don't want those.
[123:06.93]Actually, ooh, I'm running out of space.
[123:10.37]Uh, they don't stack.
[123:12.63]These don't stack.
[123:15.82]Do they?
[123:16.16]Fuck.
[123:26.02]No, bury it.
[123:31.88]Oh, shit.
[123:32.64]Okay, um... Alright, let's talk to Miriam.
[123:46.97]Great to meet you!
[123:47.51]How are you?
[123:48.57]I'm Patty.
[123:49.17]Welcome to my pipe-tastic island getaway.
[123:52.69]It's not my island, but it will be.
[123:54.03]I want to be a pop star in all pop stars' own island.
[123:57.77]So you're Jeremy from Saltcrest.
[123:59.09]Fab.
[123:59.49]I love meeting new folks, aka new fans.
[124:05.25]Anything better than kicking back and chilling on an island would be to do it forever.
[124:08.57]Spending time on an island is the best way to find your inner calm and hug it as hard as you can.
[124:14.53]If I lived on an island, pow-dow, I'd be the calmest, most relaxed cow-pop star I ever met.
[124:20.05]If you want to live on my island,
[124:27.74]Oh, to Saltcrest?
[124:28.68]Oh my, oh my gosh, yes.
[124:30.98]I could move to any old island, but this is way better since you'll be there.
[124:34.80]You hear that, world?
[124:37.66]I'm moving to Saltcrest.
[124:42.20]Yay.
[124:42.67]That's sarcastic.
[124:44.39]Oh my gosh, we're being kicked out.
[124:46.65]So stressful, so much to do.
[124:47.59]Gotta calm down.
[124:49.61]Center yourself, Abby.
[124:51.79]Find your happy place.
[124:52.89]Calm down.
[124:54.92]I'll bet.
[124:55.50]So all I gotta do is get this train going and talk to Tom.
[124:58.32]Look, easy.
[124:59.80]I cannot wait to have a cheek salt-pressed zip code.
[125:05.98]Welcome.
[125:07.58]See you when you get there.
[125:08.36]Ooh, there's another rock.
[125:22.07]I see a rock.
[125:24.26]Oh, okay.
[125:25.85]Drop this.
[125:26.37]I gotta replant some shit.
[125:28.25]So, let me... Okay, we're gonna do one of each.
[125:36.99]Plant.
[125:50.80]Okay, and then...
[125:53.78]Plant.
[125:54.10]No.
[126:03.00]Plant.
[126:03.34]I have so many yellow ones.
[126:10.92]Plant this too.
[126:15.93]Stupid.
[126:16.29]What do you mean stupid?
[126:19.79]Don't plant next to rock.
[126:22.28]Why?
[126:22.50]Why?
[126:22.66]Why?
[126:22.82]Why?
[126:22.94]Why?
[126:23.10]Why?
[126:23.24]Why?
[126:23.42]Why?
[126:23.62]What's going on?
[126:24.97]Just eat the peaches.
[126:27.37]You don't have to dig.
[126:29.32]I don't have to dig.
[126:48.47]Oh, I see what you're saying.
[126:49.80]I get it now.
[126:50.86]Now I understand.
[126:52.50]Oh, fuck it.
[126:52.94]It's already ruined.
[126:54.00]I think it's already broken in front of me.
[126:56.71]What am I going to do?
[126:57.47]No, it's over.
[127:04.40]Well, coconuts.
[127:04.90]Give me them.
[127:10.22]2,000 nook miles wasted.
[127:12.20]No, it's not.
[127:13.28]It's not.
[127:13.76]It's my first time on Nook Island.
[127:15.58]It's okay.
[127:17.68]I accidentally brought home too many plants.
[127:20.41]And I... I wasn't even looking.
[127:31.55]Can I dig up the tree?
[127:48.78]Can I take a coconut tree with me?
[127:53.28]Eat.
[127:53.50]0 out of 10.
[127:57.48]Okay, now I can... Can I... Can I take this with me?
[128:03.45]Oh my god.
[128:04.33]Let's get a... Let's take all of them.
[128:10.53]Eat another one.
[128:19.51]Fruits are steroids.
[128:21.01]Wait, why is it 1 out of 10?
[128:22.77]What happens if I eat 10?
[128:33.81]10?
[128:33.87]You'll die.
[128:36.11]This sounds bad.
[128:40.33]I'll take like 3 of them.
[128:46.17]It's a charge.
[128:47.84]Oh, okay.
[128:52.90]These have been planted on the beach?
[128:55.66]Yeah, well... Oh, wait.
[129:03.09]What about my problem with having... beach real estate?
[129:10.92]The fuck are you all... They're following me around, I swear to God.
[129:14.12]They're following me everywhere!
[129:18.12]They just... They're everywhere!
[129:29.91]Got you.
[129:34.67]Yeah, swap it.
[129:37.21]Swap it with these two stones.
[129:40.77]Okay.
[129:45.98]Anything else that I can do?
[129:47.26]I got a lot of stuff.
[129:56.74]Features are not stacked.
[130:03.24]Huh?
[130:04.26]Eat the tarantula?
[130:05.22]I'm not going to eat the tarantula.
[130:13.75]Shake the pine tree.
[130:22.07]Oh, nothing.
[130:41.99]Come on.
[130:44.59]Come on, fish.
[130:53.08]How do you keep getting tarantulas?
[130:55.62]Um... I don't know.
[130:57.92]Just check my seed.
[130:58.92]Oh, worthless.
[131:08.69]Throw it back in.
[131:12.88]Oop.
[131:13.82]There's more.
[131:14.58]Boot.
[131:29.41]I caught a boot.
[131:31.89]Swap it.
[131:32.25]Can I turn this into something?
[131:34.87]Swap it with like a... I don't know.
[131:37.47]Tree branches.
[131:40.72]I could wear these if I found another one and got a recipe.
[131:53.21]You get two boots, you can make a pair of shoes.
[131:54.69]That's funny.
[131:55.13]Come on.
[132:08.29]What is it?
[132:09.15]A tadpole?
[132:10.93]Tadpole!
[132:11.63]There's another fish over here.
[132:16.59]There's a couple.
[132:19.43]Whoa, lookit, there's a lot of fish in here.
[132:21.77]Holy- I caught a carp!
[132:38.32]If I had another one, I could do a carpool.
[132:40.76]Or swap it with... Um... I don't know.
[132:48.85]I'm out of room.
[132:54.01]Oh.
[132:59.01]Alright, I'm gonna get all the peaches, and it's time to go.
[133:01.84]I can grab the flowers.
[133:05.46]Just actually pick them up, you know?
[133:10.41]Plant those goddamn flowers.
[133:11.75]I mean, when I get back, I will.
[133:15.19]Drop them?
[133:15.69]Why?
[133:15.95]Why would I do that when you don't need peaches?
[133:23.26]Can't I just... What's the point, though?
[133:28.22]Plant them in here.
[133:28.90]Wait, aren't I just, like, leaving?
[133:32.94]This is the Mystery Island.
[133:33.74]Don't I just, like, leave after this and who gives a shit?
[133:40.15]Wait, I come back here, is what you're saying.
[133:47.16]Oh.
[133:48.08]No, you don't.
[133:51.60]Oh, you never do.
[133:58.36]Okay.
[133:59.64]I want these flowers.
[134:00.38]I want to keep them.
[134:04.18]Plants are useless.
[134:06.30]Are they?
[134:08.46]The islands are just random.
[134:11.88]Eat them, though.
[134:12.84]You don't need so many.
[134:13.74]Alright, I need to make another hole.
[134:22.96]Fuck.
[134:24.12]Just... Whatever.
[134:27.48]This one's already... I've already expelled that one.
[134:33.12]Talk to the cow?
[134:33.78]I already got the cow.
[134:34.52]The cow's coming with me.
[134:37.14]Keep plants, drop flowers.
[134:55.19]Okay.
[135:05.12]So what should I pick up instead?
[135:06.20]Wait, there's a centipede in here.
[135:14.72]I hate it.
[135:22.64]Another couple of fish.
[135:25.33]I'll try to get another fish.
[135:35.55]Every island has a piece of furniture in the trees.
[135:37.71]Really?
[135:40.18]Is it for... Are you kidding?
[135:41.02]Did I just get it?
[135:47.52]What the hell was that?
[135:51.51]Rattan wardrobe?
[135:54.47]Well.
[135:55.81]Okay.
[135:58.21]Time to go.
[136:01.02]That's it.
[136:01.94]I got everything I want.
[136:02.84]Time to move.
[136:13.24]Fun.
[136:14.97]Alright, let's go home.
[136:16.07]What about the fish?
[136:18.25]Huge fish.
[136:21.06]Alright, I'm gonna try to get the huge fish.
[136:24.40]Huge fucking fish.
[136:25.62]I'm going for it.
[136:27.46]Come here.
[136:52.22]Get it!
[137:02.63]No.
[137:04.63]I caught a koi.
[137:07.39]I can't carry it.
[137:12.17]Swap it.
[137:14.46]Swap it with the mackerel.
[137:16.48]I don't want the mackerel.
[137:22.25]Got a koi.
[137:22.77]There's another big one right here.
[137:32.34]Koi is very rare.
[137:33.42]Is it really?
[137:36.32]Nice!
[137:36.76]Is it really?
[137:37.58]That's so cool.
[137:45.97]It actually is.
[137:46.71]Kind of.
[137:48.07]Cool.
[137:54.67]No!
[137:55.53]It's okay.
[138:10.28]Okay, point number two.
[138:11.47]Okay.
[138:25.84]What, should I get rid of the clay?
[138:26.74]Should I throw my hat in the river?
[138:36.10]Throw away the boot?
[138:37.50]Okay, I'll throw the boot away.
[138:43.87]Well, that was fun.
[138:44.67]Time to go back.
[138:48.33]No!
[138:49.31]Get the boot.
[138:49.87]Wait, get rid of the shovel.
[138:51.01]Oh, I have a flimsy shovel, don't I?
[138:54.01]Bag, just drop this.
[138:57.94]I'll pick the Buddha.
[139:03.66]I'm ready to leave.
[139:04.86]That was fun.
[139:05.38]I'm ready to go home.
[139:06.04]I'm ready.
[139:06.80]Here we go.
[139:30.11]It is at this time in the stream that I'm going to go appraise some of the stuff and move stuff around.
[139:35.53]But we're going to start doing the bits.
[139:36.47]Because we're getting to the end of the stream.
[139:39.17]We're going to hang out still.
[139:49.45]It's time to say our goodbyes for probably four and a half days or so.
[139:57.00]I'll see you guys very soon.
[139:58.06]Hey, what's up?
[139:58.60]You want to talk?
[140:00.88]You're getting stuff together to build us a shop.
[140:02.50]Good hustle.
[140:03.40]I found something to help might things.
[140:04.72]Here you go.
[140:06.16]I can't carry this right now.
[140:07.92]I was going to make that iron nugget into an extra heavy free weight, but I haven't shopped much.
[140:14.52]Okay.
[140:15.60]So I'm going to put something on the screen just so people realize that this is kind of the end.
[140:28.48]So people just know what's going on.
[140:32.77]Put some text on the screen.
[140:35.03]There.
[140:35.47]So it says, end of the stream, wind down.
[140:42.54]So you know.
[141:01.93]Library stream, please be quiet.
[141:03.27]Alright, so I got a bunch of stuff.
[141:05.37]And we're gonna start going over the bits now.
[141:08.71]Hey, that guy tag!
[141:10.13]This is a long time ago.
[141:12.06]This is like six and a half hours ago.
[141:15.22]Next to the 1500 bits tag.
[141:18.00]Newer USB 3.0 capture cards have no delay, so you don't have to do audio syncs with them.
[141:24.30]Yeah, I'm just a fucking loser.
[141:26.56]And I just- I'm using the same equipment from like 2014.
[141:32.33]That's pretty much all there is to it.
[141:33.86]That's really what it is.
[141:36.80]That's pretty much what it is.
[141:38.06]I'm using the same equipment from like six and a half years ago.
[141:42.54]It is a true statement, but thanks, Tag.
[141:46.16]Hey, new place after the move.
[141:49.86]I'm gonna be a professional streamer, okay?
[141:54.08]New place resolution.
[141:56.28]New year's resolution.
[141:59.75]Thanks a lot, Tag.
[142:00.41]Appreciate it.
[142:01.39]Ooh, I can make sloshers, whatever they're called.
[142:04.33]Ooh, that's cool.
[142:09.47]Thanks a lot.
[142:09.93]That's $15 from Tag.
[142:12.75]S10WUpdate.
[142:14.53]I know your name is SlowUpdate, but I like saying it that way.
[142:17.17]Thanks for the $2.50.
[142:17.67]Hey, Jerm, I'm happy to be donating again.
[142:19.27]Glad to see you in at least functioning condition.

[142:33.08]In the fall, that'll happen.
[142:35.62]Wait, are you moving again?
[142:36.46]Yes.
[142:38.16]Staying in Las Vegas.
[142:39.96]We can get a, uh, exclamation point while you're moving, whatever the fuck the thing is.
[142:45.46]I'm gonna keep one of these coins.
[142:50.56]Put the game in the theater screen?
[142:52.67]Uh...
[142:54.09]I don't really want to do that because I'm kind of still playing it.
[142:56.45]Alright, can I make it like a fish pond?
[143:00.83]Place item.
[143:09.47]Oh, that's not enough room.
[143:14.18]This needs to be like five times bigger.
[143:17.70]Push table up against the wall.
[143:18.92]I can't.
[143:20.44]It's so small!
[143:22.32]Well, I'm donating one.
[143:25.91]the museum but yeah hopefully the uh durama rumble stuff that'll happen the Boston marathon if you don't know got pushed to hopefully in September so that's the whole point of having the stream there like we've kind of sponsoring one of my friends runs in the Boston marathon so let me go donate some of these things
[143:50.19]Thanks for the $2.50.
[143:50.87]Thank you, Gooberry Juice, for the $2.50.

[144:03.30]Hope your move goes well, and you like your new place.

[144:20.56]Uh... Oh, I can't donate anymore.
[144:22.62]Wait, can I not donate anymore?
[144:28.00]Until the museums are open?
[144:30.56]Shit, okay.
[144:31.24]Well, I guess I'll have to wait.
[144:40.88]Yeah, that was an accident.
[144:42.04]That was an accident.
[144:42.96]One accidental frame of my, like, bare shoulders.
[144:45.89]Oh well.
[144:48.48]We all know the photo.
[144:49.60]It's okay.

[145:34.58]Happy birthday on Wednesday.
[145:36.70]Oh, there's still this plant on there.
[145:42.98]Happy Wednesday birthday.
[145:45.50]Not excited to spend it at home, but I guess I'll just have to make the most of it.
[145:49.16]Anyway, it's been a great stream already.
[145:50.34]It's hard to go wrong with WarioWare.
[145:51.86]Good luck with whatever that stuff you got going on this week, and stay healthy.
[145:57.99]I'm gonna try.
[145:59.73]I tapped Donald.
[146:01.65]Accidentally.
[146:02.47]I just touched him.
[146:03.23]I just, like, poked him, like, with the... He got, like, the stick just, like... I'm trying not to poke him in the eye.
[146:09.66]Okay.
[146:11.94]But happy birthday, lizard of evil.
[146:15.01]Wait, I'm going to plant these up here.
[146:15.85]Happy birthday on Wednesday.
[146:19.23]I want... Where'd he go?
[146:28.56]What?
[146:30.58]Oh, I was trying to... What the fuck?
[146:33.46]He was hiding behind the tree.
[146:36.04]Oh, whatever.
[146:37.34]Here's my garden.
[146:58.30]You got outsmarted by a spider.
[147:04.01]Nice.
[147:05.39]Yeah, that's cool.
[147:07.59]I'll have a big garden over there eventually.
[147:09.47]Swiggity-swanky, thanks for the 250.
[147:10.89]They say, here it is.
[147:11.73]I'm not sure what here it is.
[147:14.25]It's a clip of... It says, regret.
[147:20.55]Let me listen to this.
[147:21.73]An ugly garden?
[147:22.43]Well, it's going to be ugly for a little while.
[147:27.91]I want to hear what this is.
[147:29.17]Can you guys hear it?
[147:30.49]Turn this down for a second.
[147:33.62]Alright, I don't know what this is supposed to be, but we'll find out together.
[147:40.14]I got it.
[147:40.50]What?
[147:44.96]I don't remember what this context is.
[147:55.26]Anyways.
[147:57.85]Thank you, Spriggity Spranky.
[148:00.45]Also, thank you to Archives for 500 bits.
[148:04.02]Thank you, Archives.
[148:06.72]Archives says...
[148:08.83]Hey, Jeremy, you may not be able to answer this question, but I'm going to ask you, since you're one of my biggest inspirations.
[148:12.90]When I stream, I get into this weird mode where I feel like I am not myself, because I'm in front of a live audience.
[148:17.66]Do you have any experience with this?
[148:19.62]I love streaming, but I can't seem to find the niche where I'm comfortable and enjoy every stream.
[148:23.46]Well, actually, I'm way more comfortable in front of 10,000 people than I am in front of 5,000.
[148:29.06]So I'm kind of the opposite way.
[148:32.02]I could go in front of a stadium and do anything and say anything, but you put me in a room with less than 10 people and I will have no fucking idea what to do.
[148:44.63]It was 4,700 people.
[148:45.33]Yeah, I'm rounding up.
[148:47.27]I'm rounding up from, it was like 70, that was 7,500 people here earlier.
[148:52.11]I'm rounding up a little.
[148:54.30]What, I can't round up on my resume?
[148:55.64]Why not?
[148:55.96]Why not?
[149:01.61]But, I mean, really all you can do with streaming and trying to find what you want to do is just... You just gotta start throwing spaghetti at your fridge.
[149:08.91]And see what works, see what you like to do, see how you feel.
[149:13.38]And just try to do the best you can, try to have the most fun you can, and see what happens.
[149:21.74]And trying to get more comfortable is, I mean, that's a process.
[149:24.56]Back in, like, I don't know, 2010.
[149:30.89]I mean, I can't say that I, I mean, I guess I was kind of on face cam and stuff, but I, I don't know.
[149:39.35]I feel like I've always kind of just been, I've always kind of just been the annoying center of attention weirdo.
[149:47.47]So I've always been a look at me.
[149:51.26]You know what I'm saying?
[149:54.98]Like, I've always been that, like, fucking annoying guy that's like, hey, I have something to say today.
[149:59.62]And everyone's like, okay, Jeremy's going to talk now.
[150:02.02]I guess we're all going to fucking just have to listen for the next five straight minutes.
[150:05.34]I'm going to pick up my phone and just pretend to be listening.
[150:09.26]So I've kind of been uncomfortable doing it for a long time.
[150:17.73]But the best way to get better is just to keep trying and see what makes you comfortable.
[150:22.03]Do the things you like to do, play the games you like to play, and stream the way you want to stream.
[150:26.12]It's your stream, remember.
[150:27.40]It's you.
[150:28.32]It's you doing this.
[150:32.88]He's wasting electricity.
[150:34.22]No, I'm fucking tanning right now.
[150:37.98]Come on.
[150:38.86]Wait, where's my tanning light?
[150:40.54]Here we go.
[150:44.97]I wish you the best of luck, though, with streaming and everything.
[150:50.72]Heldrich, thanks for $5.
[150:51.98]I saw you coming out of the Starbucks bathroom chewing something, but I was too anxious to ask you what it was.
[150:57.97]I cannot fucking believe that I just read that without realizing what they were talking about.
[151:01.39]Thanks for $5.
[151:02.99]A John with no H. Thanks for the 500 vids.
[151:07.21]Jerma after, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[151:11.25]That's fucking funny.
[151:12.79]Very hilarious.
[151:14.20]All these kinds of words that you wrote down here.
[151:17.00]Mm-hmm.
[151:18.11]You also say, I just finished that BLT.
[151:20.93]Uh-huh.
[151:21.67]I hope you enjoyed that bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich.
[151:24.85]A staple of America.
[151:27.67]Yes.
[151:29.01]Thank you for the $10, John.
[151:32.77]I'm not even sure if you're still... You might even be potentially banned.
[151:36.81]I might even be speaking into the wall right now.
[151:46.72]When is the next time you're going to stream?
[151:47.94]I will answer this for you.
[151:51.70]I'll answer this for you, because the rest of your two bit comments have been unreadable.
[151:57.60]Just absolutely un-fucking-readable.
[152:00.98]When do I stream in the CBT time zone?
[152:03.82]Well, I stream Pacific time, which is the west coast of the United States.
[152:09.16]I'm in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[152:11.40]Thank you for your question, and goodbye forever.
[152:14.56]Because I probably won't see you again.
[152:16.12]You may have been permanently bit.
[152:18.15]Thank you.
[152:22.25]Okay.
[152:22.97]Anyways, Ash686868, thanks for the thousand bits.
[152:28.55]What a tyrant.
[152:31.05]Mirama, I really have enjoyed your content for a couple years now, and I also love JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
[152:34.96]Can you say Killer Queen really loudly?
[152:38.84]With Killer Queen with a laser beam.
[152:42.94]What does that have to do with JoJo?
[152:47.64]I don't get it.
[152:53.08]There you go.
[152:54.78]Thank you.
[152:55.54]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[152:58.31]The man with the baby hands.
[152:59.45]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[153:00.37]Died to WarioWare wheel.
[153:02.21]Omega lul.
[153:05.83]Yep.
[153:06.85]Why is it so loud?
[153:09.00]I think I got a good tan.
[153:10.96]Died to WarioWare wheel.
[153:13.28]Sort of.
[153:15.90]Not really, though.
[153:16.76]I'm gonna go sell a bunch of shit.
[153:18.98]Wait, I got this wardrobe thing.
[153:20.61]Let me see what it is.
[153:26.34]That's... ugly.
[153:27.06]And I don't want this.
[153:27.96]Did it change?
[153:38.73]No.
[153:42.67]I don't... I'm not really into, like, the wicker basket looking stuff for furniture.
[153:46.49]I mean, I'll keep it.
[153:49.09]But, whatever.
[153:50.47]It's alright.
[153:52.51]Hey, uh, Vibio Game.
[153:53.85]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[153:56.65]Vibio Game says, Hey, Jerma, thanks so much for a fun run of streams the past few weeks.
[154:00.59]I literally moved halfway around the world from home just before all the virus stuff started, and your streams have really helped me keep me happy and sane during all the stress.
[154:09.65]Best of luck with your move, and hope you keep safe and healthy.
[154:13.67]Yeah, that's the worst part about moving now, is just, it was all planned.
[154:19.59]You know, obviously, you try to make a plan as best you can, and then all this stuff started happening, and it's like, well, what do I do now?
[154:26.10]So, Kim and I, we've been trying to figure out the best course of action to do this, and stay healthy, and avoid any potential issues, and... It's kind of tricky.
[154:39.59]Game is too loud?
[154:40.75]Oh...
[154:45.74]But we're gonna do our best.
[154:47.88]That's all we can do.
[154:49.76]Thank you, VibioGame, for the three dollars.
[154:52.12]Um... Moving halfway around the world seems like... What the fuck is that thing?
[154:57.39]Is this like a crater here?
[154:58.41]What's this crater?
[155:01.21]What is this thing?
[155:04.61]Is this lava?
[155:10.27]Look, I dug up a thousand bells.
[155:14.34]What do I do?
[155:15.02]What should I do with this?
[155:20.20]Plant it back?
[155:21.00]What do you mean plant it back?
[155:23.60]Plant it back.
[155:25.02]Bury in hole?
[155:27.03]Put it back.
[155:30.41]Whoa.
[155:32.41]Am I going to have a money tree?
[155:40.01]Are you serious?
[155:40.67]That's so cool.
[155:43.09]I can actually have a money tree.
[155:46.89]Wow.
[155:48.63]Nice, that's cool.
[155:49.37]I can't wait to see that in like nine days game time.
[155:54.02]Hey, John with no H. There you are again.
[155:56.00]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[155:57.94]Remember, these are the last of my bits.
[155:59.40]I'm done with the BLT joke.
[156:02.02]Chat thought it was hilarious.
[156:03.40]And clearly your sense of humor is several levers lower than mine because your initial reaction was to have me timed out.
[156:08.52]I love your stream and look forward to the next time you use the Starbucks.
[156:12.18]Yeah.
[156:13.40]Yeah, my humor level is so much lower.
[156:16.06]My humor level is just so... Like, the 10 rungs down on the ladder underneath.
[156:20.60]I can't even say it out loud.
[156:23.41]You know what it is.
[156:25.65]Make it permanent.
[156:29.61]Yeah, I love, I love, you know.
[156:32.27]No, no.
[156:33.15]Alright, thank you.
[156:34.67]See you later.
[156:39.27]Thanks for the bits.
[156:40.77]I appreciate it.
[156:42.03]But you've been 30 minute timed out.
[156:44.13]That's right.
[156:45.81]I don't give those out that often.
[156:47.45]That's a personal 30 minute time out.
[156:50.35]And not right now.
[156:52.47]On the night of the next start of the next stream, it begins.
[156:59.27]30 minutes for you.
[157:01.20]The moment that the next stream turns on.
[157:03.14]Oh, that's got to sting a little bit to you, don't it?
[157:10.06]Thank you.
[157:10.56]Hey, thanks, a normal user for the 300-bit stream, or you're stupid.
[157:14.51]Okay.
[157:17.67]Thanks.
[157:19.32]Thanks for the 300 monies.
[157:20.32]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[157:25.36]The man with the baby hands takes 500 bits.
[157:27.04]Of all the GameCube games you own, you pick the one where you pick up trash for 90% of it.
[157:34.61]That's fine.
[157:36.21]What's wrong with that?
[157:38.89]I wish I had a bigger net so I could catch bigger bugs.
[157:41.55]What if I caught a bug so big that I couldn't even lug it around?
[157:43.83]Do you need a bigger net?
[157:53.58]I don't know.
[157:55.20]Uh, Borkus Borkus, thanks for $30.
[157:56.38]There's no message, just $30.
[157:58.12]That's a big fucking drop.
[158:02.49]Let me try to catch some fish here.
[158:06.67]No message, just 3,000 bits.
[158:08.25]Just a bunch of money.
[158:10.97]Thank you.
[158:15.22]Come on, take it.
[158:17.38]Please move.
[158:18.26]The text is fucking the animals talking.
[158:23.22]Oh shit, you're right.
[158:24.14]Here.
[158:28.68]Uh, thanks for the 30 bucks, man.
[158:30.74]That's a lot of money just to give somebody, and this is no message.
[158:32.92]Just thanks for 30 bucks.
[158:35.60]I wish I was at Olive Garden.
[158:39.24]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[158:40.26]Ah, me too, man.
[158:41.08]Me too.
[158:43.34]Me too.
[158:46.89]Map, map, map, map, map.
[158:48.81]Uh...
[158:53.01]Alright, there!
[158:56.24]Uh, Killkun, thanks for the thousand bits.
[158:59.42]I don't watch movies, I don't listen to music, I don't watch TV.
[159:02.40]What do you do to pass the time when not streaming?
[159:04.48]Walk auto for three days?
[159:06.68]Uh, no, talk into the mirror and pretend that I'm in an Academy Award winning movie.
[159:12.65]Uh, I come up with, I, I, I, yeah.
[159:15.15]I make up my own TV shows in my mirror.
[159:21.19]It's true.
[159:21.99]You don't think it's true?
[159:23.71]That's fine.
[159:24.93]Fuck.
[159:27.37]That's depressing.
[159:42.60]I watch movie and TV shows.
[159:44.52]Just not those five Universal Studios movies.
[159:51.06]Uh, thank you Keta Meme for the 255.
[159:52.82]Would you say you're a boomer, zoomer, doomer, zoomer, or the other one?
[159:57.57]Uh... I- I'm a- I'm just a- I'm a guy that fucking just- I'm a guy.
[160:02.81]That's it.
[160:05.07]I'm a- I'm a fucking millennial.
[160:08.65]Okay?
[160:09.25]I'm none of those things that you just described.
[160:12.10]Uh, Crunch, thanks for the 300 bits.
[160:15.32]First time donating to Twitch, hope I'm doing this right.
[160:17.60]Seems like you are.
[160:19.73]Anyways, since we brought up E.T.
[160:21.49]in the stream, I'm taking the opportunity to bring up the official Rushton E.T.
[160:26.50]doll when the movie came out.
[160:27.62]They're so great and fucked up, and I'm lucky enough to have found one to own.
[160:32.32]Is this supposed to be E.T.?
[160:41.29]How the fuck is this E.T.? ?
[161:01.73]That's E.T.
[161:03.60]Okay.
[161:05.56]It seems impossible.
[161:11.32]Bug!
[161:12.76]Get the net.
[161:13.52]Get the net.
[161:13.86]Get the net.
[161:14.26]I don't think I've seen this one yet.
[161:15.44]This is a multi... I'm so bad at catching bugs.
[161:20.73]It's depressing.
[161:22.81]There we go.
[161:23.17]This is a... This is a...
[161:29.97]Thanks for the ET doll.
[161:32.01]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[161:34.13]Espada Escalada, thanks for 250.
[161:35.86]This is me watching you taking that quiz over and over again.
[161:41.82]Over for four seconds.
[161:43.00]Did I get this one in?
[161:44.18]What is it?
[161:47.24]This is Aqua Teen Hunger Force.

[162:08.46]First shot.
[162:09.36]Second shot.
[162:10.06]Guaranteed.
[162:11.20]Third shot.
[162:11.72]Guaranteed.
[162:12.28]Or I will never stream on Twitch again.
[162:13.82]Ever.
[162:14.44]I will never stream again if I don't hit this right now.
[162:20.26]Okay.
[162:28.47]pedal board?
[162:29.23]What the fuck is a pedal board?
[162:35.52]Wait, is this like a DJ table?
[162:48.74]If I leave this out, is somebody going to steal it?
[162:54.33]Oh, cool.
[162:54.91]Let's check my pedal board.
[162:56.39]Okay.
[162:59.84]I can't.

[163:36.78]Oh my god.
[163:39.76]Twins is a... I would rather watch Twins than... I can't say that.
[163:43.60]Somebody will fucking probably murder me.
[163:46.44]Um, Twins is a cool movie.
[163:51.74]Oh, the controller.
[163:52.70]Right, right, right, right.
[163:53.30]Let me sell this bug.
[163:55.23]Sell everything.
[163:56.21]Sell it all.
[163:57.93]Uh, thank you, Peaceful Haley.
[163:58.89]Appreciate it.
[164:01.27]Uh, we also had Goiki 5.
[164:02.83]More dolls from Goiki.
[164:10.26]Do you ever get the Tetris effect after you stream?
[164:12.68]It's when you play a video game so much you see it when you close your eyes.
[164:16.40]Happens to me all the time when I play Tetris.
[164:20.30]Not really.
[164:20.84]It used to happen when I played Diablo II.
[164:24.91]But not anything recently.
[164:30.19]Not anything recently.
[164:31.87]I missed bits?
[164:32.33]What are you talking about?
[164:32.87]Where?
[164:35.00]What?
[164:37.45]Missed bits, missed bits.

[164:42.17]When?
[164:42.41]Where?

[164:51.88]I got everybody so far.
[165:00.67]Yeah, I got everybody so far.
[165:09.14]According to my dashboard, the list is going from bottom to top.
[165:20.04]Yeah, what are you talking about?
[165:27.51]Did they just come in?
[165:31.75]Yeah, I'm going in descending order here.
[165:38.75]This is how... What?
[165:44.35]I'm going... These are bits from like three or four hours ago.
[165:49.68]I'll get to it eventually.
[165:50.56]I'm going to get there.
[165:51.38]I'm going to get there.
[165:57.54]He skipped it already.
[165:58.42]They're not here.
[165:59.56]I just... I'm refreshing.
[166:04.58]I don't see anything.
[166:19.72]uh not right not where I am right now there's nothing here from like three or four hours ago let's see if they pop up we'll see if they pop up eventually here but let's keep going we left off right here right the tetris that was going for the tetris effect
[166:51.10]You could always backdate your Switch system.
[166:54.98]You could always backdate your Switch system until next week.
[166:57.80]So the game wouldn't realize that you hadn't played all week.
[167:00.27]That way you could just resume like normal on stream.
[167:02.63]Like it had only been one day.
[167:03.67]I'd rather just do it the way it's intended.
[167:09.55]I'd rather do it the way it's intended.
[167:11.29]Just play it once a day.
[167:14.07]Your text is blocking the bells.
[167:15.85]It's fine.
[167:16.49]No, I want to sell.
[167:25.73]Sell.
[167:27.23]Uh, I'd rather just play it the way it's normally intended to be played.
[167:30.47]You know?
[167:31.97]Can I sell the Koi?
[167:34.81]No, I gotta donate that one.
[167:38.86]I can sell him a coconut tree?
[167:40.22]What the fuck?

[167:55.77]Hey, Jerma, I saw a white Honda Civic driving around Vegas the other day with a license plate germs.
[168:00.89]Can you confirm or deny that this was you?
[168:02.31]Uh, it was not me.
[168:08.82]Also, I live near Henderson in the Las Vegas Valley.
[168:12.06]Is that where you're headed in Vegas?
[168:13.80]Thanks for all the quality content, man.
[168:15.56]Best on your move.
[168:18.51]There's a lot of places in Las Vegas.
[168:20.79]A lot of places in Vegas for people to live if they want to live in places.
[168:25.71]A lot of great places in Vegas.
[168:28.11]A lot of people.
[168:28.93]About 3 million people live in Las Vegas.
[168:31.89]And there's a lot of great places.
[168:35.74]Thanks for the bits.
[168:37.16]Appreciate that.

[171:09.86]I'm starving.
[171:10.68]Please help.
[171:19.08]You asked for this.
[171:20.34]You guys wanted this shit.
[171:22.66]Let me go look at this shopping center.
[171:27.39]RTX 42069 TI.
[171:29.17]What a fucking unbelievable name.
[171:32.21]Utility sink, I want one.
[171:42.34]And I want a drying rack too.
[171:43.48]No, I don't.
[171:44.00]Why the fuck would I want one of those?
[171:47.54]Uh, you say, hey Jeremy, I'm happy you're branching out and playing Cities Skylines.
[171:51.06]Just keep in mind that the Cities Skylines community swears by absolute perfectionism in efficiency and design.
[171:58.18]Oh, I know.
[171:59.86]I know.
[172:00.18]Oh, I know.
[172:05.80]With some practice, I know you can become a loved mayor.
[172:08.32]I think chat is just mean.
[172:10.12]You made a lot of progress over the last few streams.
[172:11.87]I hope you play more of this game, and it's not just a 100-plus dollar joke.
[172:26.17]Ugh.
[172:28.31]Baby's first city builder is what you have to understand.
[172:30.79]Alright, that's the first time I ever played any game like that.
[172:37.50]No, my roads aren't gonna be fucking all at 90 degrees.
[172:43.92]Some of you guys need to take a fucking bath.
[172:46.99]You know, you need to take a bath with some Epsom salts in there.
[172:50.31]And just soak for a little bit.
[172:56.85]I'm more of a shower guy.
[172:58.05]Should I pay this loan down?
[173:00.33]About 10 grand?
[173:04.61]I'll do 10,000 on it.
[173:05.47]8600 left.
[173:09.72]86,000 left.
[173:09.94]Alright, now I'm going to deposit this money.
[173:15.40]I get to play with a bank account.
[173:17.10]Look at this.
[173:17.50]16,417?
[173:20.31]Cool.
[173:23.13]Hope you play more of it.
[173:24.09]Um, I don't know.
[173:24.79]Maybe.
[173:26.32]Maybe.
[173:26.92]It depends.
[173:29.32]I'd want to get some mods for it or something.
[173:33.44]Oh, I never got the hairstyles.
[173:34.64]People are going to be mad.
[173:36.26]It's okay.
[173:39.40]It's okay.
[173:45.28]But thank you to RockWriting for the 300 bits.
[173:47.24]Now realizing Jerma's villager walking around in an eye mask that resembles a maxi pad.
[173:55.57]That's, that's like a... It's actually a nice metaphor for him blindly bumbling around in the game, but in the purest way possible.
[174:03.26]Cool watching someone play AC for the first time.
[174:06.44]Anyway, stay safe, everyone.
[174:07.84]Wish Otto a peaceful move.
[174:09.96]Thank you.
[174:11.38]And thanks for implanting that image into my brain that I will never remove.
[174:16.48]Until I remove this from my eyes.
[174:18.67]Which will be later, after this stream is over.
[174:22.49]Alright, what do I want to do now before I leave?
[174:24.43]Is that enough?
[174:25.73]I think I did enough.
[174:27.23]I can't really do much anymore.
[174:29.44]Until tomorrow.
[174:32.00]Okay.
[174:33.40]Let's call it.
[174:35.94]I... Let me make sure the game's saved.
[174:39.14]I will see you guys on Saturday.
[174:44.22]I don't care if I have to stream from my cell phone.
[174:49.26]That guy's getting banned.
[174:51.01]I'll make sure of it.
[174:52.87]So let's actually do the actual wind down screen.
[174:59.53]And move there.
[175:00.87]There we go.
[175:06.39]I'm not done.
[175:08.85]What's going on tonight?
[175:11.48]This is how we do this every night.
[175:12.52]What's going on here?
[175:22.11]Irma, quick!
[175:22.51]Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe!
[175:24.07]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[175:28.79]What is this?
[175:29.17]That's just the same.
[175:42.57]Alright, anyways, let's keep going.
[175:45.93]Thank you to a literal fraud...
[175:49.52]For 500 bits.
[175:50.26]Jerma, we're gonna need to talk about this sneeze joke, man.
[175:52.44]It's not funny.
[175:53.62]Need to realize that it's not funny.
[175:55.42]It hasn't been funny.
[175:56.25]Please, we're trying to get it through to you.
[175:59.81]I thought it was funny.
[176:01.13]I'm gonna keep pressing that fucking button.
[176:04.61]Until the day I die.
[176:08.61]Ozals, thanks for the 300 bits.
[176:09.89]Hey Jeremy, Olive Garden music one guy here.
[176:13.89]Just wanted to say thanks for reading my shitty joke and turning it into an amazing one guy moment.
[176:18.07]Can we get one last BB unit before you move?
[176:21.47]God.
[176:29.90]Alright.
[176:31.36]Okay.
[176:31.50]Okay.
[176:35.65]I'll give- this is gonna be the- I'm gonna give it to you.
[176:37.15]This is gonna be so- I'm gonna do it as hard as I can.
[176:53.80]You- Okay.
[176:56.94]I- I- I just want to say... I just want to say... You...
[177:05.50]I can feel the force.
[177:08.71]I know the force way better than you do, and I'm putting my hand up, and I can see, I can read inside of your mind.
[177:16.85]And I know, if there's anything that I know, that I know, is that the thing you are hiding from me is in you.
[177:35.52]flinched so hard doing that?
[177:36.62]There you go.
[177:38.98]I'm never doing that ever again.
[177:49.30]I just want to say that I... It's in... It's in a BB unit.
[177:58.82]But I...
[178:04.26]Okay.
[178:04.60]God damn it.
[178:05.20]Hey, Eggscramble, thanks for the $2.50.
[178:06.54]Hey, Jerm, a great stream.
[178:08.26]You looked very nice and handsome today.
[178:10.04]Thanks.
[178:34.16]I know eating enough healthy food can be really tough during busy times.
[178:37.93]Chorizo, eggs, tortillas, white onions, couscous, Swiss chard, gold potatoes, hummus, Ezekiel bread, walnuts, ground turkey.
[178:45.38]Have a good week, man.
[178:46.26]Stay hydrated.
[178:46.98]What the fuck are you talking about?
[178:51.16]Those are all delicious things, but why all in a row?
[178:57.92]Hey, SpookyFox, thanks for $5!
[178:58.96]Hey, SpookyFox, thanks for $5!
[179:00.34]Hey, SpookyFox, thanks for $5!
[179:00.90]Hey, SpookyFox, thanks for $5!
[179:02.14]Hey, SpookyFox, thanks for $5!
[179:02.84]Hey, SpookyFox, thanks for $5!
[179:29.16]Thanks for the $5.
[179:31.16]Jeremy the Rat.
[179:34.30]That's okay.
[179:35.84]That's more of a name that you have when you get beat up in prison than a name that it would be for an animal.
[179:48.59]But, you know.
[179:51.06]Thank you, though.
[179:52.80]Hey, Keith King Crimson, thanks for the $2.50.
[179:55.18]Most of the characters in JoJo are named after music references.
[179:58.24]Killer Queen is one of them.
[179:59.75]Also, the pro strat is to name yourself a JoJo reference so Jerma says it out loud every time you donate.
[180:05.89]Oh, I guess that makes sense then.
[180:08.47]That's what your name is.
[180:10.45]Keith King Crimson is the name of that person that's in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
[180:18.20]JoJo's
[180:20.39]I can hear myself talk now.
[180:22.21]Jojo... Jojo... Uh, thanks.
[180:28.80]I promised I would never do that again.
[180:30.18]I didn't say I would stop streaming if I did that again, right?
[180:35.60]That wasn't part of the deal?
[180:38.27]No, it wasn't.
[180:38.71]Okay, good.
[180:41.03]Hey, Spunky Spade!
[180:42.11]There you are.
[180:42.59]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[180:44.82]Wait, are you the red bubble guy?
[180:45.72]Are you the red bubble guy?
[180:47.34]Are you the guy with like 300 listings?
[180:48.66]It's him!
[181:15.33]We got him.
[181:16.83]It's him.
[181:18.34]It's the red bubble guy.
[181:26.10]We found him.
[181:27.46]He outed himself.
[181:28.66]We didn't have to do anything.
[181:36.39]I'm the... Hey, Jeremy, just wanted to let you know, I'm the red bubble guy, first and foremost.
[181:46.17]Hey, thanks for the ten bucks, though.
[181:48.01]Thank you.
[181:50.71]Uh, it's probably bad looking, it's okay.
[181:56.34]I'll do it, I promise.
[181:56.82]What?
[182:16.38]Uh, I... What the fuck?
[182:26.93]Okay, uh... It's fucked up.
[182:30.82]Uh, thanks for the 300 bids.
[182:34.05]A celestial maid, thanks for 300 bits.
[182:35.37]Hey Jerma, I heard you generate electricity and miniature lightning bolts while walking.
[182:40.03]Is that true?
[182:41.81]If it was, I'd probably be on the cover of Time magazine.
[182:50.08]Like, the guy that can create electricity with his hands?
[182:54.72]I'd be on there.
[183:05.72]Hey, Sammy Lant, thanks for the 300 bits.
[183:08.62]I made something to help you with rocks.
[183:11.60]This is a little... This is a little chart for me.
[183:19.69]Thank you.
[183:21.69]A Little Rock chart.
[183:27.18]You say that as if you're not gonna be on Time Magazine as best streamer.
[183:31.26]I mean, remember the Carnival stream?
[183:33.46]Yeah, that's, but that's already over with.
[183:35.09]Don't you go, guys, the internet, don't you know the internet has like a, has a memory of about four days.
[183:43.15]I gotta, we gotta go.
[183:43.95]We gotta do more.
[183:44.67]We gotta do more shit.
[183:48.90]Time Magazine's already moved on from that.
[183:58.42]If I'm going to get on the cover of Time Magazine, I'm going to start to figure out how to make electricity with my hands.
[184:09.96]But thank you, Sammy Lent, for the 300 bits.
[184:15.80]Toasty Knight thanks for the 400 bits.
[184:18.09]They say achoo.
[184:19.73]Achoo.
[184:28.75]Thanks for the 400 bits.
[184:32.19]Hey, John with no H for 500 bits.
[184:35.98]It's the BLT guy again.
[184:37.48]Hey, Jerma, just want to apologize for my statements earlier regarding a BLT.
[184:41.00]I don't think I mentioned that.
[184:42.94]Well, now you are getting banned.
[184:48.94]It's like, you're hanging by a thread over, like, the cliff, and, like, I'm pulling you up, and there's, like, three other people, and I'm gonna pull you all up.
[184:59.25]Oh, no, I'm not strong enough.
[185:01.37]I got you all.
[185:01.97]Don't worry.
[185:02.53]I think I can.
[185:03.39]No, one of us.
[185:03.91]You have to let one of us go.
[185:05.33]You just looked up and said, short streamer, I'm gonna let you go.
[185:11.31]I'm gonna be like, that's the guy I'm letting go.
[185:12.80]Like, you just made my decision so much easier.
[185:27.21]You don't want me to use my, like, super strength to pull everybody up?
[185:33.18]Alright, fine.
[185:35.76]You're not big enough to save all three of us.
[185:38.98]Well, you could be let go, too.
[185:41.90]How many ropes do I have over the edge here?
[185:45.60]Am I going to have to let go of all of you?
[185:49.41]Who am I pulling up here?
[185:51.83]If you were holding onto the rope, you're not going to do this.
[185:54.65]You're not going to say this stuff while you're hanging by the rope.
[186:00.60]Pull me up.
[186:01.20]Got it.
[186:01.68]Got you.
[186:02.86]Let them all go.
[186:04.35]Well, now, that's just... That's just a... That's just a sicko thing.
[186:07.75]That's just a... You're fucking crazy.
[186:09.97]You're pulling them all up as much as you can.
[186:17.82]Hey, uh, ChurroCaptain, thanks for 500 bits.
[186:19.82]Hey, Jerma, are you gonna be using a Nook Miles ticket when you move to your new place?
[186:25.94]Yes.
[186:27.34]Yes.
[186:27.54]Yes.
[186:35.90]Let us go.
[186:36.40]We're nine inches off the ground.
[186:41.83]That was... You're so fucking funny.
[186:48.79]It's so funny when I hear these things.
[186:53.67]I go... Let them go.
[187:00.19]Let them all go.
[187:01.47]Let them all go.
[187:02.95]Just let them all go.
[187:14.36]People are screaming.
[187:19.04]Oh, God.
[187:20.90]Screaming in all caps.
[187:24.79]Hey, Egg Scramble.
[187:26.13]Thanks for the $2.50.
[187:27.09]Yo, also my 21st birthday on Tuesday.
[187:29.57]I'm going to spend it alone in quarantine.
[187:32.75]But your VODs are going to get me through it.
[187:34.95]And give me your favorite grocery list as an early birthday present.
[187:39.15]Yes.
[187:41.03]Cliff bars.
[187:42.42]A bunch of them.
[187:45.32]Campbell's soups.
[187:46.88]A bunch of them.
[187:48.10]Tons of Clif Bars.
[187:50.46]You might be able to... Oh, here comes another advertisement for a company that has no money involved here.
[187:56.79]Clif Bars are delicious.
[187:59.65]They're very filling.
[188:01.61]They'll carry you a long time.
[188:08.08]I got a bunch of them.
[188:12.04]Uh, also, stuff like boxed macaroni and cheese is really, really easy to store.
[188:18.67]Soups.
[188:19.61]Canned soups are very easy to store, and they're good.
[188:23.17]Tuna fish.
[188:24.77]Tuna fish, it keeps forever, and it can be used in a million different places.
[188:29.48]You can eat that shit out of the can.
[188:32.46]There you go, that's my grocery list.
[188:44.38]Don't forget baby food.
[188:46.94]Yeah, you get that, too.
[188:49.30]Eight-year-old diet?
[188:50.24]No, I mean, we're talking about... We're talking about, like, the quarantine stuff.
[188:55.96]Stuff they can easily... Guys, I'm not eating tuna fish out of the can every day.
[189:01.71]We're talking about, like, preparing for potentially having to be in your house for, like, two or three weeks.
[189:11.33]Non-perishables.
[189:12.23]That's correct.
[189:17.28]Peanut butter is another good one.
[189:19.14]Rice is another good one.
[189:20.75]Although rice is kind of hard to find during these kinds of... People that go into the store and they're buying up everything they can.
[189:28.67]Peanut butter is great.
[189:31.23]Beans are great.
[189:32.49]If you like refried beans, just get a bunch of them.
[189:34.91]You just eat them.
[189:37.21]Do what you can, right?
[189:43.06]I could eat refried beans.
[189:46.36]Every day.
[189:54.59]Stop talking about tuna.
[189:57.55]Sorry.
[189:59.39]But I wish you the best of luck.
[190:01.13]Everybody around the world is currently at a standstill right now.
[190:06.22]Hoping that this shit just goes away.
[190:08.34]And we can just kind of hunker down and get through it.
[190:13.24]Let's hope so.
[190:18.10]Hey, TarAlecran2.
[190:21.34]Hey Jerma, I'm holding the Taralacrin2 username hostage.
[190:24.66]If Taralacrin wants Taralacrin2, I need a bean burrito.
[190:30.89]Well, that has nothing to do with me.
[190:31.85]That is between the two of you.
[190:34.15]That is between the two.
[190:35.13]That is between you two.
[190:36.09]That's between you and Taralacrin.
[190:38.91]You, Taralacrin2, and Taralacrin is between you two.
[190:42.29]The two of you.
[190:44.57]Nothing to do with me.
[190:46.27]Hey Goobery Juice, thanks for the 300 bits.
[190:47.97]Chat whenever someone mentions JoJo.
[190:53.88]Was that a fucking JoJo reference?
[191:01.12]No hate.
[191:02.16]I know everyone has their tastes.
[191:04.56]We don't all have to like the same things to love each other.
[191:08.32]Also, there's new hairstyles and AC mirror, one of which looks like yours.
[191:12.05]I just don't even... I have no say in any of this because I've never seen the damn show.
[191:21.01]I don't even know what the show is.
[191:26.23]That show could star vegetables and fruits and shit.
[191:32.11]And I would be like, okay, that JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
[191:34.51]JoJo's a banana.
[191:36.37]And he has his band of merry strawberries and fruits and shit.
[191:41.06]And, like, vegetables.
[191:41.90]I'd be like, okay, it's a weird TV show, I guess.
[191:44.66]I wouldn't even... I don't even know what it would be.
[191:50.04]Seems like it could be... I don't know.
[191:51.22]I've never seen it.
[191:54.25]Hey Kirunch, thanks for the 500 bits.
[191:55.99]Hey, late bits, sorry about that.
[191:57.83]I don't have to say sorry, we're just hanging out.
[192:00.82]I just got confirmed, as far as I know, for my first job, and I've been wanting to donate to you for a while.
[192:06.90]Wanted to do it the day I started, but it looks like you'll be off-streaming when it happens, so I'll send them over what I currently can early.
[192:13.45]I'm a newer viewer, I just think you're genuine cool and I want to help out.
[192:17.97]Wishing you the best during your move and during our weird pandemic times, as well as everybody in chat.
[192:26.33]I really appreciate that.
[192:28.22]But take care of yourself.
[192:31.12]Make sure you're taken care of.
[192:32.62]Make sure you're taking care of your loved ones, your friends, and your family.
[192:38.42]Take care of you.
[192:39.82]I hope you do.
[192:43.47]And thanks for checking out the stream when you did.
[192:47.85]You say you're a newer viewer, so I'm not sure how new.
[192:56.07]So thank you.
[192:58.95]And good luck on the new job.
[193:07.13]We had 250.
[193:09.76]From Pigeon.
[193:10.44]Thanks, Pigeon.
[193:11.90]Hey, Jerma, it's your favorite bird.
[193:13.22]It's been a while, but college plus a boyfriend has hindered my ability to watch all your streams.
[193:19.21]So I try to keep up on the archive.
[193:22.33]Cue the you don't have to feel pressured to watch spiel.
[193:25.51]I was gonna do it.
[193:26.47]I was gonna do it.
[193:27.67]You already took the words right out of my mouth.
[193:29.48]But now with all my classes moving online, I have a lot of more time.
[193:33.16]Wish I could tell you how you've been super productive.
[193:35.50]Oh, I've been super productive.
[193:37.24]But honestly, I've just been catching up on video games.
[193:39.45]And I've been able to watch your streams again.
[193:41.99]It's good to be back.
[193:43.31]Love you.
[193:49.15]You don't have to... Yeah, yeah, yada, yada, yada.
[193:51.24]The thing I was just going to say.
[193:53.46]If you have time and you're around and you want to hang out, then by all means, absolutely.
[194:02.43]I think we're all kind of catching up on video games and sort of stuff to do in your house.
[194:17.18]He hates us.
[194:18.08]What?
[194:21.34]Why did you just write that?
[194:27.42]doctor says boyfriend sucks oh yeah I forgot about that thanks a lot pigeon good to see you again hey Keith king crimson from jojo's bizarre adventure thanks for the 250 what if you went to Olive Garden ordered endless breadsticks but the waiter brought out a single really long breadstick that stretched all the way to the back of the kitchen and no matter how much you ate more breadstick just kept coming out of the kitchen with no end in sight
[194:55.07]But I would be a little disgusted because how would that not touch other people?
[195:00.35]How would that gigantic breadstick?
[195:02.03]Some people are going to be stepping over that.
[195:03.53]Somebody might bump into it.
[195:04.47]Somebody might like put their shoe on it.
[195:06.55]Somebody could step on it.
[195:07.45]I'm not eating that.
[195:08.67]No.
[195:12.35]It's going to be limbo.
[195:18.63]But what if it's in a tube, and it comes out the end of the tube?
[195:22.39]I would ask very, very... I'd eat some of it.
[195:26.57]And after about two or three loaves of bread worth of bread, I'd say, who's the guy that spent 40 grand to make this a reality, and why is it only on my table?
[195:39.75]I see over there that that couple over there has regular breadsticks.
[195:44.43]And that couple over there and that group of friends over there has regular soups and shit.
[195:48.29]Why are you doing this to me?
[195:50.89]And then you hear just a wheeze laugh deep within the kitchen, just like a... Like a fucking wheeze laugh.
[196:02.46]I was going to do the wheeze laugh.
[196:04.54]I was going to smash it out, but I didn't because I didn't want to exert my chest cavity.
[196:13.44]Pretend I did.
[196:15.96]Hey, let's run those credits.
[196:18.98]And again, I will see you guys guaranteed Saturday.
[196:24.28]Guaranteed.
[196:26.12]If there is no stream on Saturday, then I have hell to pay.
[196:32.67]Saturday afternoon.
[196:34.75]I will be live, Garen.
[196:37.03]Fucking... Dude, I gotta stop swearing.
[196:39.19]You know, my mother told me to stop swearing.
[196:40.59]Did I tell you that?
[196:42.80]My mother caught one of my streams recently.
[196:44.74]She's like, oh, that was really interesting, really fun.
[196:46.52]Can you stop?
[196:47.08]You gotta stop swearing.
[196:48.64]And I was like, bah, bah, bah.
[196:52.34]Bah.
[196:53.33]She's like, no, I want you to stop swearing.
[196:54.73]And I'm like, bah.
[196:55.93]Bah.
[196:59.83]So as of Saturday, I'm gonna say 25% less swear words.
[197:06.90]We're gonna clean it up a little bit.
[197:09.00]So instead of fuck, it's gonna be shoot.
[197:12.48]And instead of shit, it's gonna be crap.
[197:15.92]And instead of booger, it's gonna be... snot.
[197:24.41]I don't know.
[197:24.67]Shoot.
[197:26.03]Shoot.
[197:27.82]Crap is just as bad.
[197:29.08]No, it's not.
[197:29.68]I'm kidding.
[197:32.01]My mother said three swears telling me in the sentence to tell me to stop swearing.
[197:36.25]To stop swearing.
[197:37.73]And she swore like four times.
[197:39.87]We're a swearing family.
[197:44.56]Anyways, here come the credits.
[197:47.24]They should be showing up on your screen now.
[197:49.84]In about ten seconds or so.
[197:52.76]Here they come.
[197:54.62]Thanks, everybody, for your subs.
[197:55.62]All of the new subs.
[197:56.40]All subs.
[197:57.02]All the ongoing subs.
[197:58.14]All the subs that maybe you subbed, like, 12 months ago and you never did.
[198:01.56]Maybe you got a community sub from somebody.
[198:03.56]Maybe you subbed, like, four years ago.
[198:05.04]Or whatever.
[198:06.78]Thanks for even considering.
[198:08.27]Appreciate it.
[198:09.53]All of you.
[198:09.81]We're gonna finish up the bits.
[198:13.69]We have a couple more to do.
[198:17.10]We have Cosmocrat for the 300 bits here.
[198:19.90]Three bucks.
[198:20.32]Hey, Jerma, awesome stream as always.
[198:21.50]You should play Hearthstone on Saturday.
[198:23.54]Not gonna happen.
[198:24.42]We'll buy you packs.
[198:25.46]Not gonna happen.
[198:26.36]Also, really stupid, outdated question.
[198:28.60]When you fake proposed to Kim on your moving to Vegas stream, was she in on it?
[198:31.95]Yes.
[198:33.65]I would not do that to somebody.
[198:34.77]That's so fucking horrible.
[198:39.01]Play Smite.
[198:39.83]Why?
[198:40.15]Why?
[198:40.33]Why?
[198:40.59]Is this like a... Are you guys plants?
[198:42.40]Are you guys plants?
[198:47.46]What's with, like, the plants here?
[198:49.72]Like, play Smite.
[198:54.14]It's working.
[198:55.10]Just wanna let you know.
[198:56.44]Your scheme is working.
[198:57.60]You've got me thinking about it again.
[199:00.28]What I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna go lie down in my bed with my iPad and just look at all the stats for all the gods that have released in two and a half, three years.
[199:09.77]It's working.
[199:14.37]Hey, FrozenThor516, thanks for the $2.50.
[199:19.02]Hey Jerma, today when I was watching this stream, my country, New Zealand, went into level 3 lockdown and going to level 4 lockdown in 48 hours because of the virus.
[199:28.28]I'll be at home for a month.
[199:30.23]Luckily, on the plus side, I'll be able to tune into all your live streams for one month.
[199:36.47]Stay safe out there, Jerma, and you chat.
[199:39.23]Lots of love to all of you.
[199:40.07]Also, side note, no game you ever played has ever bored me.
[199:43.58]I dare you to find a game I will hate you playing.
[199:48.13]Please step right this way to Mountain Blade or Europa Universe Sails or Crusader Kings.
[199:58.87]No one will want me to play those games.
[199:59.97]I know you guys say those things.
[200:01.79]If I play Crusader Kings, I will actually lose fans.
[200:05.47]People that are like fans of this channel will flip 180 degrees if I play Crusader Kings for more than four or five hours.
[200:15.11]I'm just telling you facts.
[200:18.06]I would be so unbearable.
[200:20.32]I would be so unbearable.
[200:21.50]See you guys on Saturday.
[200:25.15]An anonymous cheer right at the very end.
[200:27.99]$10.
[200:28.07]No message, just an anonymous amount of money.
[200:48.90]Take care of yourselves.
[200:51.72]Enjoy this week coming up here.
[200:54.23]I will be back on Saturday at the latest.
[200:59.51]I have to reiterate this one more time.
[201:01.47]The latest you will see me this Saturday afternoon.
[201:06.29]And that is a 100% guarantee.
[201:07.79]This should not take very long.
[201:10.61]Take care.
[201:11.60]Much love to you.
[201:12.54]Stay safe.
[201:16.50]See you soon.
[201:19.08]Take care.
[201:58.44]Missed bits.
[201:59.83]I did?
[202:00.07]No, I didn't.
[202:00.77]Oh, you guys want to raid Joel?
[202:05.33]What's he doing?
[202:09.51]Joel?
[202:09.85]Why raid Joel?
[202:12.75]Playing Super Mario World?
[202:17.15]Alright, let's go diarrhea over on Joel's channel.
