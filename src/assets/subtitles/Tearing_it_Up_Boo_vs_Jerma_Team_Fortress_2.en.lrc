[00:02.65]Oh, who's gonna get crushed?
[00:06.65]That guy.
[00:08.19]And this guy.
[00:09.81]And his medic friend.
[00:13.85]Oh, no, he took the health.
[00:14.63]I have seven health.
[00:15.79]Oh, Gordon.
[00:18.21]Bennett, I need health.
[00:20.05]That... Oh, no!
[00:23.86]It's so embarrassing.
[00:27.40]I landed on the...
[00:31.56]All damage.
[00:33.34]Jesus.
[00:35.96]Pyro is such a spy.
[00:38.69]There we go.
[00:40.27]Took our time, but we got him.
[00:43.13]Two crits in a row, you gotta be shitting me.
[00:45.33]My random crits really are dumb.
[00:53.29]Oh wow, I'm surprised that killed him in one shot.
[00:56.31]But... Oh my... As long as the pyro doesn't chase me, I'm happy.
[01:01.01]No, he won't.
[01:01.95]It's a... flog pyro.
[01:03.27]Run.
[01:06.15]Run for the health.
[01:08.61]Oh, the health's in the air.
[01:09.57]And the floggy pyro is here.
[01:10.95]And the flog pyro got the health!
[01:12.23]And the flog pyro killed me!
[01:13.52]That was so unlucky!
[01:17.68]That was, that was such like a, I feel like I was watching a horse race.
[01:22.20]And the Flog Pyro's here, and the Flog Pyro's gonna get the health, like it's like, and he pulls ahead by two noses.
[01:28.60]That was awesome.
[01:29.50]And the Floggy Pyro moves in.
[01:30.90]Scout goes down at the final hurdle.
[01:32.54]Floggy Pyro overtakes, Floggy Pyro takes it home.
[01:41.39]Nice.
[01:42.01]Oh god, no!
[01:42.77]Oh, I fell off the thing when I landed.
[01:44.37]Oh.
[01:45.11]I was about to hop on the plane with you.
[01:47.73]There's a Demoman just spawn camping right now.
[01:49.97]What the hell's going on?
[01:50.93]He's dead.
[01:51.33]He was doing that a couple of rounds ago.
[01:53.53]Please let the health be there.
[01:57.72]Repeat after me.
[01:58.38]I'm dead.
[02:01.36]Did you just say that?
[02:02.18]Yeah, like Dominator Pyro.
[02:05.09]Feet after feet.
[02:06.77]I'm dead.
[02:09.35]Oh, there's a spy next to you.
[02:14.50]Christ.
[02:15.02]I was just shooting him with a scattergun.
[02:16.48]That's got to hurt.
[02:16.96]But then he just took a bat in the face.
[02:18.58]That looks like it hurt even more.
[02:19.88]I don't know what I hear.
[02:27.38]Pyro?
[02:27.84]Pyro?
[02:28.48]Pyro extinguish?
[02:29.34]No, you have a Backburner.
[02:30.52]Never mind.
[02:30.88]Oh, is that what it was?
[02:32.99]I've learned my lesson.
[02:34.75]You are not going to be extinguishing me anytime soon, I am, Mr. Backburner Pyro.
[02:38.57]Hell no.
[02:39.83]Get rid of all his ammo.
[02:42.33]I just heard a spy.
[02:43.21]Oh, come on.
[02:49.12]Oh, no, don't let that medic get away.
[02:50.30]One does not simply survive while walking out of our spot.
[02:59.35]One does not simply survive when walking out of our spawn.
[03:04.53]Oh, that'll do.
[03:09.94]Why am I so bad at this?
[03:11.48]Why am I so bad at this?
[03:13.62]He can't shoot back and I can't shoot him.
[03:15.52]Good lord.
[03:19.32]I feel like that medic is a spy.
[03:21.25]Maybe not.
[03:22.99]The medic is a spy.
[03:24.09]The sniper is a heavy.
[03:25.27]The heavy is a sniper.
[03:26.43]That sniper is not one of us.
[03:27.89]That one of us is you.
[03:29.23]I'm me.
[03:30.98]I've got to concentrate.
[03:36.24]Oh, I finally killed the scout.
[03:37.54]Now for the Demoknight.
[03:40.06]That's a spy.
[03:40.72]No, it's not.
[03:43.40]That Demoman is lucky to be alive.
[03:44.76]You.
[03:45.70]Oh, I can't believe he killed me.
[03:47.42]Actually, he didn't kill me.
[03:48.13]Somebody else did.
[03:50.52]Time to find those two Demoknights.
[03:54.62]Where the hell did those Demoknights go?
[03:56.32]I nearly killed one of them, but he... got away.
[03:59.40]He escaped.
[04:01.54]Oh, you got auto-balanced!
[04:03.28]On one of those Demoknights, yeah.
[04:08.34]Is this you?
[04:09.62]Oh, that's you.
[04:11.04]I'm so sorry.
[04:12.59]Whatever, it's alright.
[04:14.90]We are opposite teams.
[04:18.28]Well then, let the games begin.
[04:20.11]This should be a very noble and dignified battle.
[04:30.75]Alright, melee war, come on!
[04:32.53]I'm using my bow.
[04:33.07]Oh, there's a sniper shooting me!
[04:34.25]Oh, the pyro, come on!
[04:36.53]The Backburner pyro spoils the fun.
[04:40.04]That was so... That was the most pathetic fight ever.
[04:47.98]I like how in the kill cam thing, they silence everything, except for the character's dialog.
[04:56.59]Pure silence, then... I'll be the same.
[05:01.03]Don't go!
[05:02.41]Uh-oh.
[05:07.32]Oh no!
[05:09.92]You stopped dead in your tracks!
[05:12.64]What am I... What am I... Oh, I can't believe I walked off the edge.
[05:20.47]You stopped dead in your tracks.
[05:21.97]It was funny.
[05:23.69]And I'm having the worst time killing the sniper.
[05:25.53]There we go.
[05:27.53]What the, what just happened?
[05:29.66]I just charged at that heavy.
[05:31.68]Oh, he has the Natascha.
[05:32.76]That's why I didn't even go anywhere.
[05:34.70]It was like I was in quicksand.
[05:38.18]That seems like a pretty good counter.
[05:40.51]Yeah, it is.
[05:41.63]Oh, there you go, 20 points.
[05:42.63]Oh, I can't, why am I so bad at this?
[05:45.17]Alright, if you kill me, I'll give you a thousand dollars.
[05:51.46]Come on, I'm on the point right now.
[05:52.62]I'm on the point right now.
[05:53.24]$1,000 if you can kill me.
[05:54.08]Yeah.
[05:55.10]I'm just making my way up.
[05:58.74]Get to keep my $1,000.
[05:59.50]Mission ends in 60 seconds.
[06:05.82]Ah, spy.
[06:06.24]Oh my god, I'm having such a tough time.
[06:10.52]Just pistol.
[06:11.56]That'll do.
[06:12.71]What the fuck is this guy doing?
[06:16.21]I wish you could have just seen my screen.
[06:20.66]Oh, man.
[06:21.48]Oh, you got me.
[06:22.87]Oh, my goodness.
[06:24.11]Dude, I really wish you could have seen my screen.
[06:26.93]That was hilarious.
[06:30.01]I just was following behind a spy, bumping into him over and over again.
[06:32.95]And he was just turning around, looking at me.
[06:35.45]And then eventually, I just stood there, staring at him.
[06:37.97]And he just started to, like, stab me in the face over and over again.
[06:40.35]And then I just clubbed him and crushed him.
[06:44.49]It was, like, almost sad.
[06:47.80]I think that guy might have just installed the game like 15 minutes ago.
[06:53.21]Welcome to Team Fortress 2.
[06:59.55]Oh my god.
[07:00.71]Need to get on that point.
[07:01.64]Oh my goodness.
[07:04.78]Good catch, dummy.
[07:10.79]Ugh.
[07:13.49]Pirate got on the point on me.
[07:14.77]You're not a spy, are you?
[07:16.51]No.
[07:16.67]No, that guy's not a spy.
[07:18.27]I got sniped again.
[07:20.45]Whenever I'm capping the point, I get sniped by the same dude.
[07:26.27]You guys are gonna get it.
[07:28.32]It's a close game.
[07:29.78]This is a good game.
[07:30.56]This is a really close game.
[07:39.22]Oh, no.
[07:41.20]Oh no... Oh my god, that's very long!
[07:44.51]I'm gonna burn to death!
[07:50.07]Oh, wait!
[07:51.45]I got burned as well.
[07:52.43]Dude, alright.
[07:54.72]I... Wow, talk about, like, existentialism.
[07:57.64]That was you, wasn't it?
[07:58.90]Yeah, I saw you on fire, and I had three health, and I said I was going to burn to death.
[08:05.50]I was, like, implanting myself into, like, your body.
[08:09.04]You capped it in overtime.
[08:10.46]Did we actually get it?
[08:11.44]Oh my god.
[08:13.87]I need to kill you.
[08:15.65]Oh, damn it!
[08:16.69]Oh, that's a spy as well.
[08:18.01]That's a spy.
[08:18.83]Kill him.
[08:19.51]Oh my goodness.
[08:20.39]And the soldiers come with the... This is, like, so close.
[08:24.21]There it is.
[08:24.99]Cow-mangle him.
[08:25.85]Cow-mangle him.
[08:27.05]Oh, no.
[08:28.58]You guys are gonna get it.
[08:29.84]There's only one soldier.
[08:32.30]It auto-scrambled!
[08:34.52]Wait, what?
[08:35.63]It auto-scrambled.
[08:36.35]Oh, wow.
[08:38.47]It auto-scrambled at the... That was the worst place for an auto-scramble.
[08:42.81]I don't believe it.
[08:45.67]What a disappointing end to a good game.
[08:47.27]I know, really.
[08:48.53]Bloody auto-scramble restarting the match.
[08:53.17]Oh, well.
[08:54.95]That was a good game, anyway.
[09:02.51]Thanks for watching!
