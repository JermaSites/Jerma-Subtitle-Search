[00:56.21]Could be the best lettuce and tomato hamburger ever.
[01:01.88]Could be the greatest lettuce and tomato hamburger ever.
[01:09.95]What's with the schedule?
[01:10.73]This is off schedule.
[01:17.07]It's extreme schedule.
[01:18.20]Well, this is off schedule.
[01:20.00]I'm going to be live tomorrow, too, at 7.
[01:27.03]What?
[01:27.21]I said it before and I'll say it again.
[01:32.57]Could be the greatest lettuce and tomato hamburger ever.
[01:37.12]The McDonald's McDLT.
[01:41.68]Alright, let's go get our ass kicked in Dark Souls 3.
[01:45.10]I might go like this, guys.
[01:46.64]You might get at least a couple times in the stream where I go, Oh, fuck!
[01:50.48]Fuck!
[01:51.22]You know what I mean?
[01:51.76]Like I'm a streamer and I get mad when I'm playing Dark Souls.
[02:00.37]How many times do you guys think I'm going to do that?
[02:01.59]You think I'm going to go... What?
[02:04.41]What the fuck?
[02:05.61]How did I die?
[02:06.51]Impossible!
[02:10.42]That's going to happen probably like once or twice.
[02:14.28]Favorite episode of Spongebob?
[02:15.32]The pizza episode.
[02:16.74]The Krabby Patty pizza.
[02:19.42]Krusty Krab pizza.
[02:21.18]Done.
[02:25.48]What a streamer.
[02:27.78]Have I been practicing?
[02:28.60]Not at all.
[02:29.88]Not even once.
[02:31.28]I jumped on for like 20 or 30 minutes just to make sure my controls were working.
[02:36.26]And I know where to go to get to the DLC, but I don't know what... Did somebody just show a clip?
[02:44.55]Where's that clip from?
[02:46.41]Oh, okay, right.
[02:48.71]This dude's insane.
[02:49.95]You gotta check him out.
[02:50.71]He gets mad.
[02:51.33]He's fucked.
[02:52.11]He's crazy.
[02:54.79]Let me see if I can get this to work.
[02:56.05]I'm gonna have to refresh it a couple times.
[02:59.82]Because it screws up all my windows.
[03:02.52]Come on.
[03:05.00]I think over time... I can't see chat right now.
[03:07.76]I'm hoping that over time... There we go.
[03:09.16]Now I can see chat, but... I'm hoping over time it'll fix the rest of these windows.
[03:20.28]I think I just got it all fixed up.
[03:23.08]Definitely did.
[03:26.92]Definitely did.
[03:28.02]Definitely did.
[03:36.16]Okay, move this out of the way.
[03:39.06]So today, we're going to be playing the Dark Souls 3 DLC, Ashes of the Anorlander.
[03:43.31]Let me move some stuff.
[03:53.45]I can see you now.
[03:56.65]Alright.
[03:58.49]On to... Alright, cool.
[04:01.19]I'm back in the game.
[04:02.59]Hi.
[04:03.93]You guys ready for some Dark Souls 3 action adventure action?
[04:08.83]It's been a while.
[04:11.46]Oh, by the way, something important before we get started.
[04:15.34]I have to... Have you caught the last Dark Souls 3 stream I did?
[04:23.21]I killed everybody at the end of the playthrough.
[04:25.71]And apparently if you kill everybody at the end of the playthrough, this happens.
[04:33.04]I can't use the blacksmith anymore.
[04:36.76]So to make the blacksmith able to be used again, I have to go pray to a shrine.
[04:40.72]And it costs 90,000 souls.
[04:45.14]Oh shit, it's not in sub-only mode.
[04:46.80]I'm an idiot.
[04:48.04]Can one of the mods put it in sub-only?
[04:49.76]Is that possible?
[04:53.28]It's going to be sub only mode because Dark Souls 3 is unanimously synonymously associated with people screaming at you, yelling at you.
[05:05.98]Spoilers, people telling you where to go, what special items exist.
[05:10.63]And last time I did it, I did sub only.
[05:12.45]So sorry, it's not going to happen.
[05:14.05]It only happens for Dark Souls.
[05:17.11]Oh my god, everybody was like, no, no!
[05:23.34]So, only, I promise, only for Dark Souls 3.
[05:27.96]In games like this, like a Dark Souls game is where I have to turn it on.
[05:34.45]It doesn't, it's not going to happen.
[05:35.63]I'm sorry that you guys got closed out.
[05:38.09]And I know I like to call this the freedom chat.
[05:40.23]But the freedom chat does have some rules sometimes.
[05:45.02]One of those rules is... No.
[05:49.90]No.
[05:52.31]Thanks a lot upon the dying grass and haterious Submode best mode Thanks for four months and five months guys and also, thank you to quick draw fast McGraw.
[06:05.76]He has like one of the greatest video games ever Thanks to the sub dude Only for Dark Souls 3 and I can't use the blacksmith so fuck it.
[06:14.29]Let's just go play Dark Souls 3
[06:21.09]I believe it's here.
[06:21.77]And we're gonna go.
[06:27.31]Thanks a lot, Goku Dog.

[06:33.62]New NPC.

[06:46.17]I wonder what happens if you kill this guy.
[06:48.03]What's going on, Ryburn?
[06:52.55]Thanks for the sub.
[06:53.65]Ryburn, not Ryburn, Rayburn.
[06:55.37]I thought I saw the no A. Thanks, man.

[07:39.44]I'm so excited.
[07:40.96]Shut up.
[07:41.48]Calm down.
[07:44.82]Don't freak it out already.
[07:45.93]I need you to show her flame.
[07:49.21]A proper flame that will burn the rot away.
[07:52.95]If you truly are ash, then it must be fire that you see.

[08:14.83]Thanks for the sub.
[08:31.12]It's like somebody's skin.
[08:33.43]Please, touch the holy scab.
[08:35.87]That wasn't a scab.
[08:39.81]It was a holy relic.
[08:41.03]Now you're fucked.
[08:47.00]What?
[08:47.64]What if I just dump dead?

[13:50.01]Rusted.
[13:50.43]Uh-oh.
[13:53.93]Those are like actual wolves.
[13:55.27]These are not undead wolves like the whole game has.
[13:57.47]These are like dire wolves.
[14:06.66]Charge him.
[14:18.02]This one is so much bigger than the other one.
[14:22.15]Oh, no.
[14:22.59]Okay, hold on.
[14:23.09]Slow down, slow down, slow down.
[14:24.23]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[14:29.91]There's a thousand of them.
[14:44.11]Ooh, what a sidestep.
[14:44.83]That was a good Dark Souls roll.
[14:46.21]Used it to be wolf.
[14:52.57]One more?
[14:56.45]Did this not stop coming out?
[14:57.39]Okay, there's gotta be like a wolf shaman that's doing this.
[15:00.26]Because they keep coming out.
[15:03.14]I'm just gonna run.
[15:05.20]This guy over here.
[15:05.72]Yep, this is the wolf shaman doing it.
[15:09.88]See, he's got the gray skin.
[15:11.46]That's the shaman.
[15:30.74]Alright.
[15:32.32]They howl and more run out.
[15:34.12]Makes sense, right?
[15:41.34]Where the fuck did he come from?
[15:42.28]Okay, that's a giant one.
[15:45.96]That's a huge one.
[15:50.39]Are you serious?
[15:54.73]Oh god.
[15:56.49]Oh god, oh god.
[15:57.85]Slow it down, slow down, slow down, slow down!
[16:18.72]Oh, fuck.
[16:19.16]Oh, boy.
[16:22.16]What the fuck was that?
[16:23.12]He just did, like, a body lunge.
[16:25.30]I'm dead.
[16:25.68]No, I'm not.
[16:27.82]When in doubt, just fucking run!
[16:30.62]Use the trees, cover, and drink the juice!
[16:41.03]He died he's dead what That's because I drank the juice
[17:05.00]Huh?
[17:07.42]One of these trees is attacking me?
[17:09.59]What the hell is this place?
[17:14.07]This is freaking me out, man.
[17:19.37]Okay.
[17:20.77]No, there's more.
[17:28.26]Don't get... I'm staying there way too long.
[17:29.50]Alright, I have no more flasks.
[17:32.62]Why did the wolf just instantly die?
[17:37.96]That wolf just accidentally died, I think, somehow.
[17:44.77]Shit.
[17:49.20]This is like... Oh, my.
[17:50.08]Look at how many there are.
[17:53.28]There's too many.
[17:55.16]What's down here?
[17:57.85]I don't know.
[18:00.60]Bugs and shit.
[18:01.28]Oh, what am I doing?
[18:01.94]This is a mistake.
[18:05.32]This is a huge mistake.
[18:09.30]They're everywhere.
[18:10.26]They're seriously everywhere.
[18:16.03]Look out for the bugs.
[18:27.68]Okay.
[18:31.26]Yeah, it's not a Dark Souls game unless somebody is randomly just like crying or moaning in the background.
[18:37.80]Well, thanks a lot to Lisbian69.
[18:39.70]Oh, you got me.
[18:42.17]SirSqueeze, thank you.
[18:43.45]SirSqueegee for the sub.
[18:46.29]UltraD3000.
[18:47.09]HolyMackerel, of course.
[18:49.77]Thanks for nine months, dude.
[18:51.49]Welcome to all you guys.
[18:54.47]Get the bug meat.
[18:57.74]I'm lost.
[18:59.50]Very much so.
[19:00.20]I don't think I can do anything down here.
[19:08.89]Subscriber only?
[19:09.59]Yeah.
[19:10.49]Only for this game.
[19:13.41]Dark Souls 3 is sub only.
[19:14.91]I guess I can go this way.
[19:23.17]What's the point of me being able to come all the way up here?
[19:26.39]And illusion.
[19:33.05]Maybe sometime later.
[19:34.45]There's a hole in here.
[19:40.33]There's a bonfire.
[19:42.90]Okay.
[19:44.22]Should I go across the bridge or get the bonfire?
[19:46.56]No, it doesn't matter.
[19:47.08]I can just drop in.
[19:47.72]Alright.
[19:49.30]New bonfire.
[19:53.48]Cool.
[19:53.60]Cool.
[19:56.53]Yeah, it's to stop, like, spoilers and people screaming at me to go certain directions and all that jazz.
[20:02.77]I'm just gonna play.
[20:03.59]Bonfire, yeah.
[20:10.40]Alright, so... Back up that way is where I was.
[20:16.27]I guess I could continue this way.
[20:26.68]That's cool looking.
[20:28.94]Be wary of detour.
[20:32.79]This is gonna drop.
[20:35.25]There's no way this bridge don't drop.
[20:36.89]Watch.
[20:38.27]I'll prove it.
[20:43.94]Told ya.
[20:50.22]Told ya!
[20:53.70]Did I just fuck myself?
[20:58.00]Could I have run across this bridge?
[21:02.76]Uh... Well, I proved my point.
[21:05.34]I'm not sure if it was good or bad.
[21:07.32]Alright.
[21:18.73]Oh, there's the ladder.
[21:24.09]Cookie!
[21:24.83]A cookie bug!
[21:27.30]Oh, come here, cookie bug!
[21:30.02]Yes!
[21:36.02]This place looks pretty large.
[21:46.35]Wow.
[21:52.03]That fire is scary.
[21:58.25]Top ourselves off.
[22:00.75]I don't blame you though.
[22:01.51]But yeah, I thought I was going to walk across and just instantly die.
[22:08.40]Going down to the town, it seems.
[22:11.42]Oh, no, we're skiing.
[22:12.64]We're just going to ski now.
[22:15.56]Can I not get back up there?
[22:17.70]Okay, that's... That's pretty cool.
[22:25.39]I could go left, or I could... Let's go around here.
[22:27.75]No, I'm gonna go left.
[22:28.89]Might be like a bonfire.
[22:40.44]Well.
[22:44.30]Hey, whatever.
[22:45.90]Time to go, right?
[22:47.97]It's not Dark Souls unless you completely get lost.
[22:49.91]I have no idea where you're going.
[22:50.85]I have to cycle back like five times.
[22:58.07]Okay, these are... Whoa.
[23:00.07]Oh, these are like weird little birds.
[23:02.77]These are like incubated egg bird things.
[23:07.51]Item all the way down to the end.
[23:17.00]Green blossom.
[23:17.94]Cool.
[23:23.82]How do I get that?
[23:25.94]Jump off the roof, probably.
[23:28.15]You have to assume you're going to have to jump off that roof.
[23:33.01]Sorry, I stepped on his head.
[23:35.44]That's a different bug.
[23:36.12]So what was up with that wolf?
[23:43.80]Did it just bug out on me?
[23:45.22]Did I get a free mini-boss kill because of the game bug?
[23:59.81]This is free souls.
[24:01.42]I'll take them.
[24:01.94]Why not, right?
[24:12.39]What's over here?
[24:14.77]Thank you, PhillyQ.
[24:15.85]PhillyQQ and... Wait, he subbed and then he resubbed?
[24:21.75]He subbed and then he resubscribed.
[24:23.61]For three months.
[24:29.58]Large soul.
[24:30.18]Okay, this is... This is... There's so many places to go.
[24:36.22]I could go down to a weird stalagmite and stalactite zone.
[24:41.59]I don't think I can make this drop.
[24:42.47]It'll kill me, right?
[24:43.51]I did it accidentally.
[24:44.33]I'm dead.
[24:52.33]See ya.
[24:59.28]Well, alright.
[25:01.16]Cool.
[25:07.15]Well, let's go across the bridge.
[25:08.09]Who gives a shit about those souls?
[25:09.29]There's only like 20k.
[25:10.25]I don't even need them.
[25:10.89]Go across the bridge.
[25:19.82]I don't like these noises.
[25:21.28]There's a lot of noises this bridge is making.
[25:32.83]Okay, we want in this door.
[25:38.77]Wouldn't be Dark Souls without falling?
[25:40.09]I know, right?
[25:41.99]Seriously.
[25:42.49]I want to get a closer look.
[25:45.78]Oh shit, that guy's gonna come alive.
[25:47.72]Guaranteed.
[25:50.18]Is he already alive?
[25:50.76]I don't know.
[25:53.50]Who has any clue?
[25:55.33]Hollow gem.
[25:58.75]This is a really, really awesome looking area, though.
[26:04.23]What's an NPC?
[26:07.28]Well... You look to be unkindled.
[26:12.08]This guy sounds like MLC Stealth last night.
[26:14.66]And yet you've slipped into the painting.
[26:17.96]Oh, no matter.
[26:20.18]If you've lost your way, the words of Lady Frieda will guide you.
[26:25.44]Now go on inside, show respect, and listen carefully.
[26:29.23]Hmm, thank you.
[26:30.63]What's keeping you?
[26:32.69]Go on, right inside.
[26:35.59]Show respect, and let Lady Frieda speak to you.
[26:38.75]Microsoft Sam.
[26:40.62]What's keeping you?
[26:42.48]Okay, well, wait, anything over here?
[26:46.16]God, I'm so fucking excited, I can't wait to see what's in this door.
[26:53.01]Emperor Palpatine, go on.
[26:55.65]Let the true power of the dark side take over you, Anakin.
[27:01.66]The bonfire.
[27:08.10]Squeaky, squeaky, squeaky, squeaky little door.
[27:12.72]Squeaky, squeaky, is that what I just said?
[27:14.13]Let's get this just in case he attacks me.
[27:24.01]There's a lot of bonfires really early on here.
[27:27.19]Snowfield, Rope Ridge.
[27:28.62]Alright, so I have to remember.
[27:29.32]In the Snowfield, I went right.
[27:30.78]I could go straight and left.
[27:31.68]I can remember that.
[27:33.34]Rope Ridge, there's still more to explore down there.
[27:38.90]And then the Ariandel Chapel.
[27:42.24]What does she have to say?
[27:45.00]Just paintings everywhere?
[27:51.52]I have long stood beside our blessed father and the rest of the forlorn.
[27:57.49]But forlorn thou seemeth not, Ashen One.
[28:01.73]I knew not the missteps which led thee to this painted world.
[28:06.90]I'm in a painting?
[28:10.06]Wow, what a rip-off.
[28:10.96]Super Mario Bros.
[28:11.66]64 already fucking did this.
[28:12.92]Okay.
[28:30.36]Ah, yes.
[28:31.82]There is a thing thou shouldst by rights possess.
[28:35.56]Ours is a chance encounter, to be sure.
[28:39.48]But perhaps it was meant to be?
[28:42.26]Let this be a remembrance of this cold world.
[28:46.35]A thing to help thee bear thy duty.
[28:48.69]Chilvite ring.
[28:50.55]Now, return from whence thou thou'st a place in that world, and that alone is cause to rejoice.
[28:59.02]Let's see what this is.
[29:00.80]Chill bite ring.
[29:06.68]Increase frost rate.
[29:07.48]I've got a feeling I probably want to put this on.
[29:13.21]Dexterity and obscures rolling.
[29:15.25]Increases dexterity.
[29:16.47]Raises max HP.
[29:19.67]Boost attack as long as attack persists.
[29:21.22]I'm probably going to take off the HP ring.
[29:23.70]Let's put it on.
[29:31.00]I'm okay for now.
[29:34.80]I mean, I am in Snow World.
[29:37.90]The life ring is useless.
[29:39.36]Yeah, I'm not even sure why I had it on.
[29:43.40]Alright, we are exploring the cathedral.
[29:45.34]The painting world.
[29:46.38]The Layers of Fear DLC.
[29:48.07]Which one is we doing?
[29:52.77]Spooky.
[29:55.13]The attack ring sucks.
[29:56.99]Does it?
[29:58.42]There's a ladder up there.
[29:59.24]Let me just take a look and see if I missed anything over here.
[30:05.80]Every ring sucks.
[30:09.06]This is a weird spot.
[30:10.08]I feel like this is going to open.
[30:12.96]Thanks a lot, Underground Frog.
[30:14.84]And CramZ13.
[30:17.72]Thank you for your subscriptions.
[30:22.65]Wait, there's that guy.
[30:23.25]I remember this guy.
[30:26.58]That's the guy from the... No, those are just... Yeah, no, these are just enemies.
[30:30.18]Never mind.
[30:30.88]Let's go up the stairs.
[30:33.28]This guy wants me to leave really badly.
[30:35.06]This guy's just doing the BS sound.
[30:56.63]Yeah.
[30:57.29]There is one thing you should know.
[30:58.89]Yeah.
[30:59.53]Inside strafe.
[31:00.51]Let's go up there.
[31:03.52]Let's take a trip up the ladder and see what is beholding us.
[31:11.34]Thanks a lot, Ramlot.
[31:12.90]10-16.
[31:13.71]Welcome to the friends of Ariandel.
[31:21.79]Oh, shit.
[31:22.19]My snowbox.
[31:22.85]You ruined it.
[31:30.54]Item required ahead.
[31:31.50]What the hell?
[31:35.42]Do I have to actually get in the painting?
[31:46.34]I think I actually have to paint the painting somehow.
[31:50.81]But what item do I need?
[31:55.60]I don't think I can do anything here.
[32:01.55]No.
[32:02.87]Doesn't seem like it.
[32:05.19]Unless I... What did that... Hold on.
[32:11.59]I don't think I have anything that's here.
[32:19.08]No, fuck it.
[32:24.20]Item required.
[32:26.14]Some kind of item.
[32:28.20]I'm going to assume that that is kill a boss and come back up here, probably.
[32:33.18]Got to paint deeper.
[32:40.68]Did I do anything with the shrine?
[32:41.58]I don't think so.
[32:45.38]I don't think... How did somebody die in here?
[32:46.66]What the hell is this guy doing?
[32:52.98]Guy just had a heart attack in the corner.
[32:54.20]Nothing was even attacking him.
[32:58.22]What is making... Yeah, something is making a loud noise.
[33:00.38]Let's take a look over here again.
[33:07.94]I don't think I missed anything.
[33:12.08]I'm going to have to go down where my body was before.
[33:18.79]To import your layers of fear save file.
[33:27.63]Wait a second.
[33:29.49]What if... No.
[33:33.05]No, no, no.
[33:36.51]I'm going to go down that way.
[33:37.37]There's a big ladder.
[33:40.65]Right over here.
[33:50.57]There's things to do down here.
[33:57.01]Fuck.
[33:58.13]God, it's gonna scare me every time.
[34:02.48]Please.
[34:09.96]Roll off?
[34:11.00]Oh my goodness, that would be a terrible idea.
[34:17.32]There's another ladder.
[34:18.36]Where is it?
[34:19.06]I saw it.
[34:21.10]Wasn't there a huge ladder over here?
[34:24.74]It's right there.
[34:26.56]Shit.
[34:29.30]How do I get up there?
[34:29.96]I guess I was up there already?
[34:39.15]Well, shit.
[34:49.59]Alright.
[34:51.25]Can I get over there from here?
[34:52.61]No.
[34:55.78]What about down here?
[34:56.36]Because the bonfire is here.
[34:59.32]Can I wrap around?
[35:00.22]I don't think so.
[35:05.09]Jump for it?
[35:05.69]I will instantly die if I jump for it.
[35:17.27]I'm going to backtrack over this way.
[35:22.57]Nothing up there.
[35:27.29]I don't have the kitty cat ring.
[35:28.53]I still get like five things on the way down.
[35:38.91]Alright, there's that.
[35:39.87]I'm going to go back to the first bonfire.
[35:47.94]That first bonfire, I'm going to go straight instead of to the right.
[35:53.32]I forgot, what about these weird tree people?
[35:56.85]They're not alive.
[36:00.05]What activates these tree ladies to start shooting fireballs at you?
[36:06.49]There you go.
[36:06.99]Okay, there she is.
[36:14.75]So it's just random ones turn alive?
[36:16.35]If I slide them to the left, I gotta get it.
[36:25.29]Can I backstab these ladies?
[36:38.35]Okay.
[36:39.95]Bugs.
[36:41.27]Surrounding.
[36:50.68]Just a couple of bugs.
[36:52.54]No big deal.
[36:55.87]That is kind of a big deal, though, because these things hurt.
[36:59.55]Frozen weapon.
[37:01.71]Cool.
[37:07.30]Anything else down here besides frozen weapon?
[37:16.65]Shit, here comes the wolves again.
[37:17.65]Is that big?
[37:18.53]I hope that big wolf doesn't come back.
[37:23.96]I can't tell from back here.
[37:25.34]Is that a big wolf?
[37:28.40]It's kind of a big wolf.
[37:35.86]Big wolves.
[37:37.94]That guy's going to pop out again.
[37:39.12]A huge one.
[37:39.80]Stop thinking about that and think about what's in front of you.
[37:41.80]The actual small wolf.
[37:42.90]Don't think about the big wolf yet.
[37:44.37]He's not here.
[37:47.69]I'm getting scared of preemptive jump scares that haven't happened yet.
[37:52.51]Alright, so this is... I gotta go back.
[37:54.03]I'm just gonna run by these things.
[37:59.63]This might be a mistake.
[38:00.57]This could be a huge mistake.
[38:07.84]Did I go over this way?
[38:10.56]I don't think so.
[38:12.28]This is where I freaked out.
[38:14.82]Is there anything over here?
[38:25.79]Not yet.
[38:26.11]There's a person with a bow and arrow up there.
[38:29.81]There's like a hundred wolves chasing me.
[38:32.50]Oh my god.
[38:33.40]There are probably twelve coming after me right now.
[38:39.98]No, please.
[38:41.71]No.
[38:42.95]No.
[38:44.01]Get away from me.
[38:56.24]I think just one just jumped off the cliff and died.
[39:01.27]Did one just jump off the cliff and die?
[39:06.31]Wait, a house, a house, a house, a house, a house.
[39:09.62]Oh crap.
[39:11.12]There's a guy here too.
[39:16.68]Just spam, spam in every direction.
[39:25.56]Ah, I gotta get, like, an enclosed area.
[39:30.25]Take it slow.
[39:32.11]Take it slow.
[39:34.23]What is that?
[39:34.73]Come on, here.
[39:41.21]Okay, one down.
[39:41.75]Two down.
[39:45.53]Ah, goodness.
[39:51.31]There's a guy throwing knives.
[39:52.93]More than knives, spears.
[39:58.94]I see a door, I see a door, I see a door.
[40:00.28]I missed a bunch of items, but you know what?
[40:01.64]Fuck it, we have to get this.
[40:02.38]We have to get in a bonfire, right?
[40:04.25]Come on.
[40:07.19]No, no bonfire.
[40:08.17]Just a scary guy.
[40:12.47]Oh my god.
[40:13.63]God in heaven.
[40:15.55]There's a guy here too.
[40:17.75]Oh my god.
[40:23.12]There's a swing in every direction.
[40:25.46]It's fucking calamity.
[40:33.43]Okay, note to self.
[40:36.86]Do not go that way.
[40:42.94]I had to fight, like, Valkyrs.
[40:44.48]Alright, I'm going to... Get out of here.
[40:50.61]I'm going to travel to the snow field.
[40:51.75]I'm going to go straight.
[40:57.07]Shit.
[41:01.51]Finally enjoying the action cam, yeah.
[41:08.97]Okay, I went that way.
[41:10.11]Let's go this way.
[41:11.93]Who's talking?
[41:20.96]Is there a guy back here somewhere?
[41:26.98]Huh?
[41:31.45]I swear to God, there's probably a guy standing here.
[41:33.15]And I'm not seeing it.
[41:36.32]And everyone's going to be really mad at me that I missed the guy standing over there.
[41:44.35]She's not alive yet.
[41:45.85]She probably will be.
[41:46.59]I'm going to take it slow.
[41:54.43]Did you see that dodge?
[41:56.23]Pull that one back.
[41:58.35]I didn't even know it was coming.
[41:59.23]I still dodged it.
[42:07.83]Keep going this way.
[42:14.27]Is it a white walker?
[42:16.33]I'm getting serious Game of Thrones vibes.
[42:19.77]They must have just watched the last season.
[42:26.78]Bug.
[42:30.58]Poison gem.
[42:31.34]I don't think I can get up there.
[42:38.63]I've seen better dodges.
[42:45.05]Yeah, nothing special, really.
[42:46.59]Alright, I guess I can only go this way.
[42:56.12]Can I sneak by the wolves or something?
[42:59.31]Because there are a hundred of them.
[43:09.00]I can hear them.
[43:09.58]I can already hear them.
[43:21.89]Back off.
[43:25.19]Hey, back off, scumbag.
[43:28.15]Did somebody teach that guy how to fucking sword fight?
[43:37.75]Oh my god.
[43:38.95]This is just a circus.
[43:41.67]You got the fire-breathing act, you got the guys with the dancing blades, you got the fucking two guys with the shields.
[43:45.49]This is a fucking circus act.
[44:02.36]Ahhhh.
[44:02.82]Ahhhh.
[44:08.10]Get out of my fucking life!
[44:10.68]You and your buddy.
[44:17.74]That's all it took.
[44:24.44]Yeah, everyone remembers the guy with the shield.
[44:26.14]What a classic circus act.
[44:28.66]Guy with the shield.
[44:35.67]You guys know what I'm talking about, though.
[44:38.61]Get the amazing Rando, the guy that fucking throws the spear through the bullet, the, the, the target.
[44:44.43]I can't even think!
[44:50.50]Where was I?
[44:58.66]Shit, everything, oh no!
[45:00.97]I'm gonna get lost in the woods because everything looks the same.
[45:04.67]No, this is correct, this is correct.
[45:13.68]Use the gun.
[45:15.66]You guys know what I'm talking about.
[45:17.00]No.
[45:19.58]God damn it.
[45:24.90]What does that even do?
[45:25.91]I don't... What just happened to my character?
[45:32.25]Did I fall in a trap or did I just make it... I made the grass a little more green.
[45:38.15]And here are the wolves.
[45:40.44]We're gonna take this slow and I'm gonna kill every single wolf.
[45:44.28]I'm not gonna fuck around.
[45:47.12]I'm gonna do this smart.
[45:50.32]Definitely don't want him to do that, because then he summons more wolves.
[45:57.16]Okay, well now it doesn't matter.
[45:58.06]Like, four of them did it anyway.
[45:59.22]So now here come all the wolves.
[46:05.03]You know, I would really wish the fucking tree would stop getting in my way.
[46:08.25]Into the view.
[46:18.23]You want to see like a snow tree you want to go right up the camera's ass oh you don't oh yeah I want to get that item too slow easy slow and sure I'm gonna go over here
[46:47.56]This is like the top of the hill.
[46:50.40]Can I backstab her?
[46:51.18]I think I already tried that.
[46:57.28]Alright, I'm being up here.
[46:58.40]I didn't get this though.
[47:05.87]Holy shit.
[47:06.59]These are arcane missiles.
[47:07.49]Somebody just cast arcane missiles at me.
[47:10.05]Here's a wolf.
[47:11.27]In case you didn't want to deal with a wolf too, here's one.
[47:16.37]I'm taking so much fire.
[47:17.63]I think I'm going to put on fire resist or something.
[47:22.01]I just want the item.
[47:22.85]That's all I care about.
[47:23.61]Go.
[47:24.05]Run.
[47:24.51]Full speed.
[47:26.77]Full speed.
[47:27.87]Give me the item.
[47:30.01]Tight night shard.
[47:35.21]Tree casts hot.
[47:36.21]Yeah, the trees have fire and ice powers.
[47:42.76]That should not be allowed.
[47:45.30]More wolves, top myself off.
[47:48.18]Where is he?
[47:50.22]They're behind me!
[47:52.49]Fuck it, go, go!
[47:55.75]Just run.
[47:59.17]Pick that up, pick that up, pick that up, go go go go go go go go go!
[48:04.34]They're trying to block me off, this is like a GTA chase where the police try to get in front of you.
[48:12.48]I'm gonna tactic, new tactic.
[48:16.09]Go for a leap and jump off the cliff, all of you.
[48:21.72]I think it worked.
[48:22.12]Is it working?
[48:25.02]Am I jumping off?
[48:25.86]Jump off!
[48:26.68]It's working!
[48:32.50]Jump off the fucking cliff!
[48:41.43]Uh...
[48:46.67]Dammit.
[48:52.53]Change of plan.
[48:56.07]I'm going to the rope bridge.
[49:02.14]R.I.P.
[49:08.26]20k souls.
[49:09.02]I don't even care.
[49:13.72]So I'm going backwards from this.
[49:15.90]I'm not running through 100 wolves again.
[49:21.09]I should be able to go all the way back from here, right?
[49:33.08]Alright.
[49:36.36]It's these dumb wolves!
[49:38.65]There has to be something to those wolves where you can, like, make them not... Oh, I forgot about these people, too.
[49:45.62]There's gotta be something with the wolves.
[49:48.82]Where you can turn them off.
[49:56.28]God, now I'm just... I'm playing like a fucking idiot right now.
[49:58.80]Do you see how many times I was just spamming R1?
[50:02.66]It was so unnecessary.
[50:19.87]This is such a bad place to fight him, too.
[50:21.29]I gotta get out of here.
[50:31.35]Shit!
[50:35.03]Oh, come on!
[50:36.47]Come on!
[50:37.94]Come on!
[50:40.44]There's no way you're serious right now.
[50:45.84]Do I need, like, special boots so they can't hear me?
[50:50.01]This is fucking stupid.
[50:53.28]Oh my lord, I'm dead again.
[50:58.94]That was so lucky.
[51:06.14]If you, like, get in a fight, you just have to fight, like, 25 wolves, no matter what.
[51:11.06]There's gotta be something I'm missing.
[51:23.67]I thought I already killed the big wolf.
[51:24.71]Shouldn't killing the big wolf turn off all these little shit wolves?
[51:37.31]Shit, that's not good.
[51:42.13]Thought I had the chill ring on.
[51:50.08]I hate video games.
[51:55.14]No, I just gotta, I gotta like just be patient.
[51:57.16]It's one of those situations where this is an area where if you, you can't run through it.
[52:02.82]Oh my god, you're gonna be chased by 35 wolves.
[52:10.46]You have to stop, I gotta stop and smell the roses, and the roses are these fucking idiot witch bitch things that light a Christmas tree on fire and shoot 100 arcane missiles at you.
[52:39.13]Alright, there we go.
[52:42.99]Thanks a lot, Premium Pillow.
[52:44.07]Please, please get in the dirt.
[52:55.28]Heeyup!
[53:01.72]Alright, now I have a second to see, like, where I even am.
[53:08.81]Jeremy's using bad words.
[53:11.77]I am using bad words, that is true.
[53:16.45]Okay, slowly but surely.
[53:18.09]Let's find out what's over here.
[53:26.46]Really still casting that, Abby?
[53:29.32]Come on, give me a break.
[53:33.70]Seems to be nothing over on the left side.
[53:35.98]Cool.
[53:45.32]Alright, wolves.
[53:50.26]Shut up.
[53:52.55]Did he get it off?
[53:54.21]Oh, he did.
[53:54.89]He did.
[53:55.57]Apparently he did.
[53:56.91]Give me these.
[53:58.69]Where are they coming from?
[54:03.63]Yep, there they are.
[54:05.50]Oh my goodness.
[54:07.08]Are they going to be behind me too?
[54:11.18]Hope not.
[54:16.97]First strike Alright, I have not come up here oh My god first it was wolves now.
[54:38.60]It's the circus action There's a tree lady there's two tree lady
[54:50.28]There's four tree ladies.
[54:54.53]Okay, I think I'm going to run through this.
[54:58.01]I got a feeling this ain't gonna end well at all.
[55:04.77]This is new armor.
[55:16.62]Damn it.
[55:18.38]One guy throwing the dumb spears.
[55:22.17]Two guys actually throwing spears.
[55:23.47]See, those are the jugglers and this is the fire breather.
[55:27.21]You guys didn't think of it as a circus?
[55:37.40]Ayayay, they're so off-timed!
[55:40.22]They're doing it every second!
[55:42.24]Stop this nonsense!
[55:52.86]Oh, I missed.
[55:53.86]I'm out of Estus flasks.
[55:59.99]And there's a bunch of tree ladies.
[56:02.19]We're going for a run here.
[56:03.17]I got rid of the circus.
[56:05.59]We just have to get by the tree ladies.
[56:08.63]I think it was a success.
[56:13.44]Except not really, because there's still one more fire-breathing guy left.
[56:18.16]Success, what is it?
[56:19.38]Follower Javelin.
[56:21.52]It's a new weapon.
[56:26.39]Alright, I'm not sure where to go from here.
[56:38.70]What's that?
[56:39.95]Is that the original bonfire?
[56:41.69]Or is that a new bonfire?
[56:45.21]No, this is the bonfire.
[56:47.05]Okay.
[56:49.13]So, it looks like I have to go that way.
[56:53.28]So, where's it going to run?
[56:58.48]Because that's where I can't... I'm just going to go.
[56:59.65]We're just going straight over here.
[57:01.35]I got the javelin.
[57:04.37]So where's the only place I haven't gone?
[57:06.49]It's probably down here.
[57:10.99]No, it's not down there.
[57:18.34]To the left?
[57:19.14]Where have I not explored?
[57:20.02]Okay.
[57:24.26]Okay.
[57:29.94]I just wrapped around.
[57:30.74]I hate how everything's too snowy.
[57:51.67]Yeah, I remember that.
[57:52.51]Yeah, the whole world collapses.
[57:54.82]Okay, now from here...
[57:59.15]Where from here... Is the question.
[58:06.21]Wolves.
[58:06.67]Fuck the wolves.
[58:07.35]I don't even care.
[58:08.07]We're not stopping.
[58:08.69]I want to try to get back to where I was before.
[58:10.54]I don't want to go that way.
[58:14.66]I can't hear a lot of...
[58:29.83]Loud noises around me.
[58:34.65]These wolves are fighting each other.
[58:36.77]To who is going to be able to eat me alive.
[58:43.12]Well, we've successfully haggard every single wolf.
[58:45.76]Let's hope we don't run out of stamina.
[58:51.91]Okay, I think we're going on the right track.
[58:54.17]Yeah, on the right track.
[58:55.07]All the way down to the left.
[58:57.74]No, this is where I was before.
[58:59.32]Now, what's the secret thing to... Okay, only two wolves.
[59:03.72]No, there's three.
[59:04.50]There's four.
[59:05.02]And there's probably five.
[59:05.78]So we're going to run again.
[59:06.64]Because there's a giant Viking man to the left here.
[59:12.68]Avoid Viking man and run by tower.
[59:14.32]Go this way.
[59:18.12]And... Then... We're safe.
[59:27.88]We're safe.
[59:28.16]We're safe.
[59:28.48]Do it again.
[59:28.94]Come back.
[59:29.34]Come back.
[59:29.56]Come on.
[59:29.74]Come on.
[59:30.02]Do it.
[59:30.30]Come at me.
[59:31.08]Come at me and do the same thing.
[59:32.00]Come on.
[59:33.94]No.
[59:34.10]Do the dumb jump to the left like he did.
[59:35.50]I dodged that.
[59:49.09]Oh my lord.
[59:49.91]We're going to keep going.
[59:51.75]Keep going.
[59:52.53]Keep going.
[59:58.87]What else is down?
[59:59.63]What's going on?
[60:05.58]I don't know what else is happening.
[60:07.20]Besides the fact that I've got, I've got, okay.
[60:09.62]Easy, easy game.
[60:11.44]Easy fucking game.
[60:12.32]Look at how easy this game is.
[60:15.64]What are you doing?
[60:25.20]What are you doing?
[60:25.68]What are you doing?
[60:28.79]Okay, I got too distracted!
[60:29.87]I got too distracted!
[60:33.83]Fucking trees!
[60:35.99]Oh, they put them in the... They're always in the worst spots!
[60:44.27]Big Minotaur.
[60:46.74]Okay, I'm just gonna see what this guy does for moves.
[60:48.36]Okay, he does the sword slash down, and then an arrow drops by my face.
[60:53.82]Oh no.
[60:58.25]Shit in my pants!
[60:59.11]Shit in my fucking pants!
[61:00.59]There's another one now.
[61:01.75]Right when I got here and I was gonna be safe.
[61:04.43]I just can't... This ain't even Mortal Kombat!
[61:09.94]I just got Mortal Kombated.
[61:13.60]Yeah, I got through.
[61:14.44]I got... cool.
[61:23.66]Easy game.
[61:24.90]Well, at least I know how to get down there again.
[61:27.00]It was like, here you go, you let the world fall and you wrap around to the left.
[61:32.77]Which way was that, though?
[61:34.63]Was that this way or that way?
[61:36.07]I don't fucking remember.
[61:36.91]Once I get the snow to fall, that's how I know I'm going the right way.
[61:46.68]But everything looks identical, so it's hard to even remember where the hell that was.
[61:56.69]Oh, I wrapped around in a complete circle.
[62:02.41]Okay, I need to remember where that was.
[62:04.42]Where, like, the ground falls.
[62:07.76]Once I activate that, then I know where to go.
[62:09.50]Okay, this is left.
[62:20.08]This is, like, in the middle.
[62:23.82]And this is going now towards, like, the right.
[62:26.93]Come on, now.
[62:29.41]I'm, like, wrapping around in a circle again.
[62:33.77]This is the right area.
[62:34.47]Okay.
[62:34.67]Oh, no!
[62:35.09]World Bell.
[62:36.39]Alright.
[62:41.23]Now I should be able to wrap around here, right?
[62:45.60]Is it this way?
[62:53.30]Don't think it was this way.
[62:56.84]I don't think it was this way.
[63:02.80]Was it?
[63:03.18]Maybe it was.
[63:11.77]No, it wasn't this way.
[63:12.83]Do I have to go back?
[63:20.11]It's alright.
[63:23.44]Although, I could just use this bonfire now.
[63:26.28]Couldn't I?
[63:26.74]And then go backwards?
[63:31.46]I think that is what I want.
[63:33.10]Because if I go backwards up here... I'm definitely going to die here, by the way.
[63:37.76]I just want to know.
[63:39.96]That bonfire takes me up here, which is where I want it to be.
[63:44.87]Which, if I go right...
[63:55.72]I think this is it.
[63:58.90]All the way down.
[64:02.28]I wonder what's safer.
[64:03.06]Get out of my way.
[64:12.67]Have I been gone over here?
[64:17.58]I don't think I'm... Okay, no, no, no, no.
[64:19.22]This is...
[64:22.46]This is where the three stooges were.
[64:24.30]I remember the three stooges.
[64:25.40]I have to put this into long-term memory.
[64:30.90]It's going to be so hard for me to do that.
[64:32.64]I have extreme trouble when everything looks the same.
[64:37.10]I have to memorize one path.
[64:45.37]Dog barks.
[64:49.27]Here it is.
[64:56.13]Remember that one waking up and being like, oh, I'm tired.
[65:04.52]Let's take this opportunity to prepare ourselves for the trial to come.
[65:20.83]Come on, one by one by one.
[65:34.25]by one.
[65:36.25]The attention span of a goldfish?
[65:38.13]No, I just have horrible spatial awareness problems.
[65:42.00]So when things look like... Hey, look!
[65:44.42]It's a white fog with white ground and white trees!
[65:47.98]I have no idea where the fuck I am.
[65:49.04]I could be in somebody else's house right now.
[65:52.14]In fact, I probably am.
[65:57.54]So let's not get the guy in the bell tower to throw shit out of the leaning tower of pizza.
[66:04.65]Let's fight this guy.
[66:07.80]Come on.
[66:12.22]This way.
[66:14.32]Don't get comboed by Mr. Viking.
[66:17.20]That would be bad.
[66:20.19]One, two.
[66:20.71]There's one, two.
[66:23.31]Can't do anything else besides one, two.
[66:28.59]One, two.
[66:31.34]I blocked it.
[66:34.98]That's new.
[66:38.76]Okay.
[66:39.30]That's that move.
[66:44.07]There it is again.
[66:46.85]Oh, this... Oh, God.
[66:49.11]There's, like, such a delay when he swings that fucking axe up.
[66:53.18]I'm so angry right now.
[66:57.02]Ugh.
[67:05.47]Ay, ay, ay.
[67:08.33]Come on.
[67:10.83]He has to go, hold on, I'm gonna do it now.
[67:17.18]Son of a bitch.
[67:17.90]Alright, where the hell am I going again?
[67:26.57]Anger.
[67:27.27]My internet.
[67:27.93]Wait.
[67:28.11]Okay.
[67:28.29]Somebody just scared the shit out of me.
[67:30.07]I saw internet sucks and I was like, wait a minute.
[67:31.63]What?
[67:32.57]I looked over and I wasn't dropping.
[67:34.11]Am I at the wrong bonfire?
[67:35.67]I'm at the wrong bonfire right now.
[67:42.86]I looked over at my internet and I lost where I was.
[67:47.98]No.
[67:48.30]This is correct.
[67:50.64]Drop the Earth underneath me, please.
[67:57.94]Alright, now what?
[67:58.58]Okay, from here.
[67:59.22]Was there an item right there?
[68:02.39]No, no, no, no.
[68:07.43]No, no, no.
[68:09.01]The dong fire.
[68:11.99]Yeah, first you gotta go to the dong fire.
[68:21.04]Bong wrong fire.
[68:30.05]Come on, little dogs.
[68:33.37]Oh my lord.
[68:36.49]No.
[68:39.69]Already this is going very, very badly.
[68:45.11]That little side step makes me want to put a fucking hammer to my skull.
[68:50.55]Oh, hi.
[68:51.49]That is a lot of damage.
[69:14.00]No stamina.
[69:14.72]Oh, fuck!
[69:19.87]One more of those.
[69:26.47]Come on, give it to me.
[69:29.97]Now he decides to attack.
[69:31.81]Nice opportunity.
[69:32.51]You missed it, buddy.
[69:33.27]Sorry.
[69:43.17]Is Jerem's strategy just to run away from the wolves and die to the Viking guy?
[69:47.05]It's been the strategy for the last, like, 30-40 minutes.
[69:51.77]Okay.
[69:52.33]I've not been here yet without getting... pummeled.
[70:00.14]Let me just take a look around.
[70:01.82]There's a tree lady.
[70:05.54]I'm not gonna let you do anything to me.
[70:08.36]Please.
[70:10.26]There's another Viking guy.
[70:13.50]There's a Viking guy up there that throws, so I want to pull the next Viking guy behind one of these.
[70:17.08]Oh, there's a guy.
[70:20.08]Okay.
[70:20.64]Viking guy right here.
[70:21.62]And a wolf.
[70:24.50]Excuse you.
[70:25.04]Viking guy right here.
[70:29.53]Can I, like, slide under here and make him attack?
[70:33.65]Of course I can.
[70:35.27]Of course I can get hit by that through the wall.
[70:38.93]Come on.
[70:39.53]I want to pull this guy.
[70:44.10]He's not listening.
[70:46.20]I feel like I pulled somebody else, though.
[70:48.56]What am I hearing?
[70:51.30]Oh my god, I'm hearing noises.
[70:52.22]All kinds of noises.
[70:52.96]Dog noises.
[70:55.84]Ah!
[71:12.19]Oh, boy!
[71:16.81]Jesus, the fucking swing speed is so slow!
[71:20.11]I'm like turning into a Sesame Street character.
[71:29.19]Easy game?
[71:29.63]Come on, give me an easy game.
[71:31.66]Give me the easy game.
[71:48.07]Okay.
[71:54.32]Now we get a wolf.
[71:56.96]Okay, I missed, but he didn't.
[72:00.68]Not fair.
[72:01.98]That just barely hit me right in the face.
[72:04.34]It didn't, though.
[72:07.00]Viking guy, part two and a half.
[72:10.81]They're... They're... Oh, they explode.
[72:12.75]They explode.
[72:13.25]They're... That's...
[72:22.28]How many guys are throwing shit at me from up there?
[72:25.52]Oh, you wanna fucking play that game?
[72:27.34]Fine.
[72:28.62]We can play that game.
[72:35.07]You'd like to play that game, wouldn't you?
[72:49.69]Come on, I know I can do it.
[72:57.66]God damn it.
[73:02.08]What is with the chat right now?
[73:03.46]All I see is like boons.
[73:04.33]Okay, let's try to play that game with this guy.
[73:08.43]He's going to come around the corner now.
[73:13.15]I can play it too.
[73:16.51]Doesn't do like any damage.
[73:17.55]Forget it.
[73:17.99]Forget what I said.
[73:18.49]I don't want to play it.
[73:20.19]In fact, I want to bring this guy all the way back through the castle entrance.
[73:24.97]So I can easy game him.
[73:42.45]I got hit by the fucking goddamn javelin, idiot.
[73:45.53]Come back here and fight me.
[73:46.45]Fight me back here or you won't.
[73:52.32]Please lock onto him.
[73:56.48]Why?
[73:57.22]Why can they- It's a pinpoint accuracy.
[74:23.35]Get it!
[74:30.41]My whole body hurts
[74:36.47]Hey, thank you, Sir Fratley, for subscribing in Polish Toaster.
[74:40.07]Thank you for eight months in a row.
[74:43.28]Thank you to Lockyman and Glassyman for eight months.
[74:46.40]And Austin601 for four months.
[74:48.98]MetalSox240, RamLod1016, thanks a lot, guys.
[74:57.32]Okay, now, what a clicker.
[74:59.42]Can't even 1v1 a viking.
[75:03.29]I think this is an open area.
[75:04.31]No, there's another guy over there.
[75:06.21]My goodness.
[75:13.08]Am I fat rolling right now?
[75:14.74]Yes, I am.
[75:21.15]I need to get in that building.
[75:22.21]There's a guy in that building too.
[75:23.57]I'm so screwed.
[75:25.63]Let's see what's up over here.
[75:33.57]Give me a bonfire or something.
[75:40.22]I can't.
[75:40.68]No.
[75:45.58]I gotta go in the building.
[75:48.12]Or right around here.
[75:48.76]We're not gonna go in it yet.
[75:49.60]I'm gonna take a look over here.
[75:52.59]Gotta be like a something up here I can do.
[75:55.29]Bonfire or something.
[75:59.01]No.
[76:00.01]No.
[76:01.91]No.
[76:06.67]No.
[76:09.29]Where on Earth am I?
[76:12.29]I hear a bunch of loud screams and noises and I'm not even sure.
[76:14.83]I'm going to sit right here.
[76:16.79]Where the hell am I?
[76:28.76]Are these rocks made out of dog?
[76:34.50]What's the safest way down here?
[76:35.50]I'm going to die if I do this, don't I?
[76:36.90]Okay.
[76:48.61]Wait, wasn't there an item down here?
[76:50.65]There was, wasn't there?
[76:51.43]I guess I'm going to get it.
[76:55.41]Apparently.
[76:59.43]Okay.
[77:07.24]Yeah, here it is.
[77:08.94]Large Solve an Unknown Traveler.
[77:10.30]That was great that I came all the way down here for that.
[77:18.94]Well.
[77:21.10]That was that.
[77:24.04]It's pretty solid.
[77:31.58]Um.
[77:34.05]I don't know which way is left and which way is right right now.
[77:38.56]Yeah, okay.
[77:39.34]I'm gonna just sprint up here.
[77:42.12]Um... Looks like I have to go in that tower.
[77:48.12]Somehow, with zero flasks.
[77:50.10]And running through all the walls.
[77:52.70]I don't think... This is not even the right way.
[77:55.56]It's alright.
[77:56.28]You know what I mean?
[77:59.32]Sometimes you just gotta say who gives a shit.
[78:01.70]I'm doing that right now.
[78:02.80]You know what I mean?
[78:04.77]Who gives a shit?
[78:13.77]They ran too fast.
[78:16.55]Somebody died.
[78:18.41]During that whole thing, a wolf died.
[78:19.85]This is too intense.
[78:24.65]Alright, I'm going straight in the front door.
[78:27.40]Wrapping around to the left drops you.
[78:29.98]Until I get the special snow boots.
[78:36.54]In the building we go.
[78:39.33]With no health.
[78:40.35]Oh, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[78:41.23]Not in the building yet.
[78:41.89]There's one more spot.
[78:45.32]Spot to go.
[78:46.08]Don't even think about dropping there.
[78:48.70]What is that?
[78:49.92]Quite something ahead, really.
[78:52.52]Fake wall?
[79:00.06]Hey.
[79:01.58]Hey.
[79:04.42]Blessed gem.
[79:09.32]There's not even a way you can do that.
[79:10.74]No way.
[79:11.48]I call such bullshit right now.
[79:14.56]That's unbelievable.
[79:16.84]No way.
[79:19.98]He's just blocking my exit.
[79:26.11]Come on.
[79:27.11]Come on, just fall off.
[79:28.67]Be an idiot, Dark Souls enemy, and fall off.

[80:18.49]I'm obsessed with causing more problems for myself.
[80:23.21]I like to just cause issues for myself.
[80:24.90]Do you guys know what the spring you're watching?
[80:26.68]The guy that causes issues for himself.
[80:35.06]Here we go again.
[80:39.97]I'm not mentally stable for this.
[80:44.76]Set the death count to 100 so you're good for the next 20 to 15 minutes.
[80:49.17]I'll be fine.
[80:50.59]I've heard this area is super hard.
[80:53.13]Dude, IGN said that this is the hardest game that he's ever played in his life.
[80:56.87]This part right here, especially with the fucking wolves.
[81:00.03]Frank Peterson of IGN.com said that.
[81:02.62]You're gonna argue with Frank Peterson?
[81:04.88]He's the chief executive officer of IGN.
[81:09.38]Get out of my way.
[81:14.22]Go in the building.
[81:15.74]We're just running to the top.
[81:18.42]To the right, I didn't go over there, but whatever.
[81:20.42]We're not doing that.
[81:22.42]We're just going right in the front door.
[81:24.76]And we're just going up the stairs.
[81:28.68]Forget about everything else.
[81:29.90]Yeah, guy on the stairs.
[81:33.86]Thank you.
[81:34.24]See you later.
[81:34.76]Don't want to have anything to do with you.
[81:36.16]What's up here?
[81:36.82]Please tell me something of value.
[81:40.68]There's a ladder.
[81:41.12]Okay, ladder.
[81:41.64]Should I climb the ladder or climb the stairs?
[81:43.44]Climb the ladder.
[81:49.50]I'm so scared right now.
[81:50.78]I'm so nervous.
[81:52.61]Is an item on the stairs?
[81:56.97]Oh shit, is he climbing?
[81:58.11]Can they climb?
[81:59.39]I think he's too big to climb.
[82:00.47]Yeah, he might be a little too big.
[82:18.64]He's so fast.
[82:19.42]This is such a bad place to fight this guy.
[82:23.32]I have no stamina.
[82:32.91]Couldn't see through the dust.
[82:33.71]Got him.
[82:44.96]What a dumb idea.
[82:49.72]Where'd he go?
[82:52.24]I lost him.
[82:55.23]Thank God.
[82:55.91]Good.
[82:56.55]Fuck off.
[83:01.01]Ah, what an enticing item.
[83:07.33]Millwood Battleaxe.
[83:08.67]Cool.
[83:11.48]Is there nothing else to do up here?
[83:13.24]Ooh.
[83:20.79]Can I, like, climb this shit?
[83:27.33]This seems to be... I can get up even higher.
[83:29.31]I guess I go outside.
[83:30.59]Oh, no.
[83:32.41]Don't even do this shit to me.
[83:36.57]Yeah, there's a ladder.
[83:43.12]Too bad you're a dex pleb.
[83:48.24]Ooh.
[83:49.64]Large... I heard a noise.
[83:52.88]Is nothing else up next to me?
[83:55.02]Does not like... Hey, you made it.
[83:56.21]Please go to the next zone.
[84:03.09]Captain's ashes.
[84:04.17]Okay.
[84:07.08]Let me get a good view here.
[84:11.56]Where have I not been?
[84:17.15]I can bring those ashes back to that lady.
[84:21.04]Although I'm not entirely sure where the hell to go.
[84:22.82]Because there's the cathedral.
[84:44.95]Whatever that is.
[84:45.48]The painting place is the bridge.
[84:51.04]Yummy, crunchy ashes.
[84:52.18]Yeah, that's right.
[84:56.28]Let's go back down and just slowly walk around the tower.
[85:04.13]I could go back to the bird village.
[85:05.25]That's right.
[85:06.67]I could do that.
[85:07.33]I hope we don't run into our friend down here.
[85:13.75]That would make me exquisitely upset.
[85:26.54]Anything over here?
[85:28.90]No.
[85:35.10]Item right here.
[85:36.24]I also hear lots of growling.
[85:41.20]Cookie bug.
[85:45.63]Item, cookie bug.
[85:47.23]Item, cookie bug.
[85:48.61]Cookie bug.
[85:58.84]I'm gonna fucking seriously scream.
[86:03.52]Oh, what's that?
[86:04.16]Whoops!
[86:05.22]Whoopsie!
[86:05.90]Oh, whoopsie daisy!
[86:06.72]Oh my god.
[86:13.00]Oak Shield, who cares?
[86:14.18]I missed the fucking cookie bug.
[86:29.31]Holy fuck!
[86:31.03]It's much bigger than I originally anticipated.
[86:34.15]I thought that was the bottom of the tower.
[86:45.44]I thought that was the bottom of the tower.
[86:54.08]Well, I'm gonna go give the ashes to that lady.
[86:56.74]See what the fuck that does.
[87:03.37]That is the shittiest place.
[87:06.41]That tower has three huge guys.
[87:08.79]Good luck fucking getting through there.
[87:11.43]Wait, what?
[87:15.70]Here's an idea, uh, uh, Jerry.
[87:17.36]Let's, let's have, like, this tiny little fucking tube sausage tower.
[87:21.24]And put, like, three huge guys in it that swing in a three hundred and fucking sixty degree.
[87:25.78]The whole, the whole, the entire length of the whole sausage tower.
[87:30.63]Oh, by the way, the only place you can stand is on a two foot staircase.
[87:37.19]Fuck you.
[87:38.39]Fuck you, game.
[87:40.21]Ah.
[87:44.00]Alright, let's see what this does.
[87:49.88]I have another thing of ashes.
[87:50.84]Carla's ashes?
[87:51.56]Who the hell's that?
[87:52.00]What the hell is this?
[87:52.58]Did I kill her and take that?
[87:56.38]Okay.
[87:56.54]What do we got?
[87:57.44]What's new?
[87:57.70]Tilted.
[87:57.92]Tilted.
[88:14.23]Washing Pole.
[88:15.49]Is this new?
[88:18.63]I got a couple of new weapons I want to look at, though.
[88:20.17]I have so much shit.
[88:22.79]I don't even know what's new and what's not new.
[88:31.43]Whatever.
[88:32.60]Alright.
[88:36.32]Let's see.
[88:38.80]I got this.
[88:41.12]What is it?
[88:41.82]Battle Axe.
[88:48.29]Millwood Axe, C and E. Just curious what it looks like and how it plays.
[88:57.71]Seems like a pretty standard axe to me.
[89:02.34]Big charge.
[89:03.04]Okay, that's kind of cool.
[89:07.22]Let's put our katana back on, though.
[89:10.98]Whatever.
[89:11.88]Alright, let's go.
[89:17.44]Now the question is, where to next?
[89:28.53]I'm going to go to the chapel again.
[89:31.77]Let's go check out the chapel.
[89:42.51]What, Atalkus is talking about his emotes?
[89:45.33]His emotos?
[89:48.86]Let me get a better understanding of, like, this world around me.
[89:55.75]Nothing there, nothing there.
[89:56.61]Does this guy have anything new to say?
[89:57.91]Thanks for the info.
[89:58.65]You really are helping a lot, man.
[90:14.30]Let's go back out here.
[90:15.14]I want to take a look.
[90:16.08]There's a couple of places I could have possibly gotten to from the bridge, but I didn't do.
[90:23.60]From the bridge.
[90:34.05]Let's cut this down.
[90:39.93]Cut it down.
[90:40.89]Get down.
[90:51.26]Is there a ladder here that I can get on now?
[90:53.26]No.
[90:55.38]Oh, there is.
[90:55.98]Descend.
[90:58.36]This is the ladder.
[90:59.00]Okay.
[90:59.30]That was weird.
[90:59.78]It didn't show up there.
[91:00.38]Alright.
[91:00.65]Let's get down to this new spot.
[91:01.89]New spot.
[91:03.69]Let's get freezer burn on our hands.
[91:09.77]All righty.
[91:14.75]Cool.
[91:16.71]This is down the ladder on the other side.
[91:21.14]Moss clump.
[91:24.58]Sweet.
[91:25.96]Thank you, Sprigwar, for eight months.
[91:27.48]Nailed it.
[91:27.87]That was... He was just... He was talking about me and the tower.
[91:30.05]He's being... You know, thank you very much, though.
[91:31.77]Thanks for eight months.
[91:33.37]Hey, Terrius.
[91:33.95]Thanks for 100 bits, dude.
[91:35.07]And the Epic E. Also, Major598.
[91:37.27]And Premium Pillow again.
[91:40.69]I love you all.
[91:43.02]Now, watch... Dude, look at this streamer.
[91:44.88]Getting really mad at Dark.
[91:46.16]Oh, fuck this.
[91:47.00]I'm already... I'm already mad.
[91:50.42]I was about to make like a... I thought there was a guy that was going to give me an item.
[91:53.60]Dead already.
[91:54.76]Bye.
[91:55.02]Okay.
[91:55.34]So, there's that.
[91:56.46]There's this place.
[91:58.82]There's that.
[91:59.24]There's the vines and this guy who I thought was going to have an item on him.
[92:02.26]No, he didn't have an item.
[92:03.00]He was a guy that was not dead.
[92:07.28]Fuck, dude.
[92:12.39]Fuck.
[92:13.55]Oh, my God.
[92:14.49]I can't believe it.
[92:19.87]Oh, fuck.
[92:21.57]Can't believe this shit, dude.
[92:25.91]By the way, check out G2A.
[92:27.57]Go to g2a.com slash derba.
[92:30.69]Jalos of pre-games.
[92:41.32]There's also a bat down there.
[92:45.66]I don't think... Did I even go over there?
[92:48.40]Across the way to the... Let's just check this out first.
[93:00.75]Sellout.
[93:01.29]Alright.
[93:05.22]Back on the vines.
[93:08.14]Check out my vine.
[93:08.84]Vine.com.
[93:09.18]Well, you're there.
[93:14.67]Sign up for our monthly fucking newsletter!
[93:28.05]I can't move.
[93:34.92]That sucks.
[93:35.70]He is in such a bad spot.
[93:38.36]I don't want to ever do that guy again.
[93:42.60]Let's assess the situation.
[93:47.15]We can drop here.
[93:49.23]There.
[93:50.99]Go that way.
[93:52.37]I want to go that way.
[93:56.04]Nice parry.
[94:00.44]Please.
[94:02.40]What's that noise?
[94:06.69]Dead.
[94:13.33]Those guys are throwing the exploding javelins at me.
[94:18.60]From where I am here.
[94:25.04]I don't know why I rolled.
[94:27.36]I have to do that guy again.
[94:36.73]Those guys throw the javelins.
[94:39.35]You can't take your time there.
[94:42.19]Oh boy.
[94:45.51]Very nice rolls.
[94:48.15]Come on.
[94:50.45]Yeah, that was the definition of a panic roll.
[94:52.05]It really was.
[94:52.49]Come on, give me a little bit of slack here.
[94:54.35]It's my first time ever playing Dark Souls 3.
[94:58.44]I got to the DLC area, my brother got me this far, and he gave me the control over 12 lives.
[95:06.52]I need to know what's at the bottom.
[95:15.37]So where were they throwing that thing from?
[95:19.25]Was I panicking?
[95:20.72]Who was even doing that?
[95:24.04]I have to parry this guy.
[95:26.38]I might not even need to, actually.
[95:30.88]Yeah, he's just sleeping.
[95:32.52]Let him sleep.
[95:33.86]Who cares?
[95:38.36]Yeah, forget about that guy.
[95:40.46]Alright, this is where it happened.
[95:42.78]Where is it?
[95:44.96]Oh!
[95:51.19]How many more lives do I have?
[95:52.25]Three more lives?
[95:52.95]It was in my leg.
[95:55.45]It was in my leg.
[95:56.45]Oh, man.
[95:57.29]Thank God.
[96:01.07]This is so easy to get to.
[96:17.83]If it wasn't this simple to get here, I would not do that ever again.
[96:26.56]Now I know that guy's sleeping.
[96:28.06]I don't have to touch him.
[96:30.48]Wait, there's lives in the DLC?
[96:31.76]I only get 12 lives.
[96:34.90]My brother, I told you, my brother got me to this far.
[96:37.84]And he got me here with 12 lives.
[96:40.99]Can you descend, please?
[96:47.27]FailFish.
[96:51.04]Come on.
[96:51.36]Give me a break.
[96:53.38]This is difficult.
[96:54.82]How are you supposed to know this is gonna happen?
[96:57.66]Come on, guys.
[96:59.74]Well, you got the snooze queen.
[97:01.90]He woke up this time.
[97:02.88]That's great.
[97:04.26]We're just gonna go.
[97:04.84]Forget everything and just go.
[97:05.86]Gotta go faster than this.
[97:11.65]This guy has fire.
[97:15.43]I wanna go up here.
[97:21.00]There's nothing even up here.
[97:22.34]Fake wall.
[97:24.02]Oh, poop.
[97:24.50]Oh, poop.
[97:27.82]What is it?
[97:28.96]Where was it?
[97:29.56]What?
[97:31.30]What?
[97:33.52]What the fuck?
[97:36.02]I just stepped on a landmine.
[97:37.40]Fuck this place.
[97:47.05]That was bullshit.
[97:48.21]I didn't even see it.
[97:49.27]Did you guys even see where it was?
[97:50.59]I didn't even see it.
[98:04.49]RIP LOL you died.
[98:11.14]Only two more lives.
[98:18.71]Alright, well now I know there's nothing up on that one.
[98:20.45]You have to check it all.
[98:22.00]You gotta check everything, man.
[98:27.46]I saw it.
[98:27.82]You did?
[98:29.34]You've got better eyes than me.
[98:30.50]I need an eye transplant.
[98:36.38]Any unlicensed physicians in this chat want to give me an eye transplant?
[98:41.49]I pay in cash.
[98:42.37]200 bucks.
[98:47.72]Did he wake up?
[98:48.44]Me landing woke him up.
[98:50.18]Alright, let's think about this.
[98:51.14]Think about this.
[98:51.54]Think about this.
[98:52.06]Right here.
[98:54.94]Then down.
[98:57.65]Up here.
[98:58.01]I'm gonna get to level ground right here.
[99:01.11]Cookie bug.
[99:06.75]Nice.
[99:07.01]Okay, good.
[99:10.30]I honestly didn't even see that guy.
[99:11.38]He was a floating skull for me.
[99:13.88]Jesus.
[99:20.09]Are they still firing at me?
[99:34.28]What about this way?
[99:34.84]Nothing over here?
[99:36.26]Nope.
[99:37.41]I bet you there's something on the other side of that twig.
[99:40.41]But I ain't gonna find out.
[99:45.71]Somebody's marching above me right now.
[99:48.59]But they're not coming down here.
[99:52.43]I gotta wait for him to throw the next one.
[99:54.49]Where is he?
[99:56.54]Where is he?
[99:57.06]Where is he?
[99:58.78]Did he fall off?
[100:01.66]I think he fell off.
[100:05.14]What an idiot.
[100:06.84]Wow.
[100:07.72]How do you fall off?
[100:09.08]What a moron.
[100:12.56]An ember.
[100:12.92]Is that a bonfire?
[100:21.77]This is not good.
[100:23.21]Let me take a small... Who did that?
[100:29.18]That guy.
[100:30.90]There he is.
[100:33.78]I'm not sure I can even get up there.
[100:41.46]Down?
[100:42.60]This way.
[100:44.98]Oh my god, what do I do?
[100:46.34]Right here?
[100:46.92]Right here.
[100:48.83]Oh my god.

[101:22.62]Give me the bonfire.
[101:23.64]Where is it?
[101:23.88]Right over here.
[101:25.42]Where was it?
[101:25.82]Where was it?
[101:26.22]There's a sleeping fucking naked guy over there.
[101:29.32]Hold on.
[101:29.66]Give me the bonfire.
[101:32.22]I lost it.
[101:32.68]Where was it?
[101:37.84]Over here?
[101:38.68]I missed it.
[101:42.66]No, this is definitely a boss.
[101:45.12]Boss, boss, boss.
[101:45.88]No, that's not.
[101:46.42]I need to go over here.
[101:50.34]Where was that fucking bonfire?
[102:20.46]Get out of here.
[102:30.60]Not this time.
[102:31.60]I know all your tricks now.
[102:35.14]Okay, honest to God, where was that bonfire?
[102:39.93]It wasn't over here.
[102:40.59]I think it was to the left.
[102:41.31]I think it was by the naked guy.
[102:48.19]There it is.
[102:55.75]I don't want to aggro that thing, whatever it is.
[102:57.39]Get me the bonfire first, or anything else.
[103:03.49]Phew!
[103:04.63]Alright.
[103:06.73]I got this.
[103:13.21]Now, the question is, what is this abominable snowman guy?
[103:20.91]That was a crab.
[103:22.99]Okay, that was a sleeping naked guy.
[103:24.81]You guys all know it.
[103:25.45]You saw it.
[103:25.75]It was a frozen freezer bird naked guy.
[103:27.57]This guy, I cannot even hurt.
[103:41.49]Another one.
[103:42.13]Another one.
[103:43.33]Where was he?
[103:43.87]It was this one.
[103:46.31]It was that guy.
[103:50.17]I can't even make any rhyme or reason to what I'm witnessing right now.
[103:55.55]Two giant frozen crabs.
[103:57.35]Alright, but what are you hiding over here, is the question.
[104:05.72]Because I don't even care.
[104:13.84]Go dance on somebody else's grave.
[104:15.34]Give me the item.
[104:17.68]Get me out of here.
[104:21.34]Okay, this is real ice.
[104:25.71]You guys see how crazy this ice looks?
[104:28.31]I feel like I could actually reach out and touch this.
[104:34.07]It would be cold.
[104:41.88]There's another spot to go.
[104:45.72]That is absolutely guaranteed for me right now.
[104:47.82]That's the...
[104:51.59]The boss is definitely back there.
[104:53.16]Or one of the bosses.
[104:53.76]I don't even know how many there are in this game.
[105:00.98]Two crabs.
[105:05.73]Hey... Hey, thanks Ventus the Fox.
[105:15.70]Ventus the Foxy.
[105:17.86]Welcome.
[105:18.32]Thanks for something.
[105:22.62]One more.
[105:28.02]Huh?
[105:28.32]It's a source of... Sorry, I just picked up Snap Freeze.
[105:36.67]Wow!
[105:39.27]Those branches do a lot of damage.
[105:41.87]This one's acting a lot differently than the other ones.
[105:43.85]The other ones were not doing this.
[105:46.71]Holy shit.
[105:48.77]That reach.
[105:49.77]That... Okay.
[105:52.68]Apparently there are some witch ladies that attack melee and crawl on all fours.
[106:00.30]Good to know.
[106:02.78]Thank you game for conditioning me the whole time to know that those people don't do that and then just have one just start doing it and kill you.
[106:10.50]Fucking great experience.
[106:11.42]I wanna see the boss.
[106:24.10]Let's take a look.
[106:25.86]It's going to be a giant.
[106:27.86]Better not be a crab.
[106:30.46]If this shit's a crab, I'm going to be real mad.
[106:36.59]Crazy area, though.
[106:44.47]Try bleeding.
[106:46.43]Do it.
[106:47.67]Ah, victory.
[106:48.60]Not victory yet.
[106:49.32]I haven't beaten him yet.
[106:50.58]Whatever it is.
[106:54.09]It's definitely a crab.
[106:57.27]No, it isn't.
[107:01.33]It's a wolf.
[107:03.15]It's a default wolf.
[107:04.99]Two default wolves is the boss.
[107:11.24]No.
[107:13.22]It's that random, like, hunter.
[107:16.28]And he summons wolves.
[107:17.86]Fantastic.
[107:19.06]This guy sucks.
[107:21.56]Yeah, whatever you say, fucking Ivanooz.
[107:25.06]Just wait, watch me beat Ivan Ooze in the first fucking try.
[107:34.24]Yeah, fuck you, Ivan Ooze.
[107:40.85]Doesn't even have any pants on.
[107:43.37]Oh, what's that?
[107:46.73]Gonna get parried again?
[107:47.93]Do it again.
[107:48.94]Call your wolves in.
[107:50.00]Oh, excuse me, sorry, that's a triple parry.
[107:53.93]Oh, would you like to stand up, Mr. Rose, and try it again?
[107:56.95]Quadruple parry.
[107:58.49]Didn't think I had it in me.
[107:59.81]I wasn't sure if I could be able to do a septuple parry.
[108:02.29]Maybe we're going to see a septuple parry.
[108:03.72]It's possible.
[108:04.42]Septuple parry.
[108:05.78]What's he doing?
[108:06.14]What are you doing?
[108:10.86]There's a big wolf.
[108:12.14]Big wolf, big wolf, big wolf, big wolf, big wolf.
[108:15.18]Big wolf, big wolf.
[108:20.52]That's not fair.
[108:22.38]That is not fair.
[108:24.66]I gotta parry him.
[108:29.36]And he's casting, like, sorceries now.
[108:31.36]No, just get- fucking, I gotta- Bye.
[108:49.97]He's making a bullet!
[108:51.74]He just turns into a dog bullet!
[108:54.96]It's not fair!
[108:57.04]How come I don't get a dog?
[109:00.12]How come I don't get a fucking bullet bell dog?
[109:04.27]There he comes.
[109:05.65]Jesus!
[109:08.63]Oh my god!
[109:18.10]It's just like what the fuck am I supposed to do when he does this?
[109:22.50]When I have George the fucking Animal Steel next to me.
[109:25.84]Why am I giving him random games like this?
[109:29.87]Parry, septuple parry, septuple parry.
[109:32.59]Septuple parry is all I gotta do!
[109:36.47]I just have to kill the guy, guaranteed.
[109:39.25]I just have to kill the guy!
[109:54.67]I thought I just had to kill the guy.
[109:55.73]Alright, let's do it again.
[110:03.95]I'll get him.
[110:13.62]Well, I was about to say, this is pretty easy.
[110:19.21]Rage coffee.
[110:19.95]It really was a rage coffee.
[110:23.88]I have to avoid the guy then.
[110:26.64]Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[110:27.42]I think I have... First, let's take care of the two wolves that are here.
[110:30.46]Because they're annoying.
[110:32.78]It's just two... The boss has two default wolves.
[110:49.50]Shit.
[110:50.10]Come on.
[110:53.51]I'm just getting so greedy.
[110:54.55]I have to be patient here.
[110:57.25]I really should put an enchantment on my weapon too, shouldn't I?
[111:00.09]That would probably help.
[111:13.18]Really?
[111:16.26]Now I'm in my own head.
[111:17.34]I had the guy.
[111:18.45]I had him septuple parried and now I'm inside my own head.
[111:27.68]Really?
[111:28.68]You didn't parry him?
[111:32.26]You did the alliance symbol to me.
[111:36.28]Oh my god.
[111:38.84]Fuck the parry.
[111:56.76]He's getting in his head a little bit here.
[111:58.40]I really am.
[112:02.40]So, I gotta kill the wolf.
[112:03.54]Big wolf has to die first.
[112:06.80]It's gonna be a nightmare, though.
[112:09.60]Are you serious?
[112:10.33]I dodged that.
[112:10.91]No way.
[112:12.39]No freaking way.
[112:16.47]Didn't parry that.
[112:22.02]Is this where he goes?
[112:22.60]Is this where the dog comes out?
[112:23.50]Yeah, okay.
[112:25.12]Fuck this guy.
[112:25.58]I don't even care about you anymore.
[112:27.05]Fight the dog.
[112:31.11]Fight stiff.
[112:50.86]Not this time.
[112:54.16]He's calling in other worlds, isn't he?
[112:56.56]Once he had no idea what he was doing.
[113:21.80]Oh, mother of mercy on my soul!
[113:31.70]I gotta get some space here.
[113:32.88]I've got everything with George.
[113:45.91]Shit!
[113:48.27]Ah, he did it twice in a row, I would've had it.
[113:52.56]I'm putting on fire.
[113:56.26]I got it this time, for sure.
[114:01.01]That just like... WHAM!
[114:02.49]WHAM!
[114:02.95]It's so hard to dodge that twice in a row.
[114:06.95]Alright, we're doing an ember.
[114:08.52]And I'm putting on the fire paper.
[114:14.12]Do I have any fire paper?
[114:15.20]I do.
[114:16.98]Let's get this on the bar.
[114:21.24]No, it already is on the bar.
[114:21.95]No, it's not.
[114:26.65]Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
[114:30.76]Get this off.
[114:39.71]Okie dokie.
[114:42.73]And I'll take an Ember.
[114:43.91]Why not?
[114:44.57]Let's do an Ember.
[114:45.81]Get some extra health.
[114:50.32]Let's go kill Dog and his little dog friend.
[114:58.30]Hey, what's up?
[114:58.68]It's the Bloodstaff Beast.
[114:59.74]Oh, no, not this again.
[115:00.74]Yeah, because this guy just kind of becomes a little shit after Sif 2 comes out.
[115:09.82]Really just got to not be a moron here and lose all my Estus Flasks for no reason.
[115:16.90]The dog is manageable as long as you can dodge that super fast I almost kill you in one hit move.
[115:32.75]Where's the other dog?
[115:38.67]Shit, forgot about the third one.
[115:41.50]Wow, there he is.
[115:42.22]Hello.
[115:43.82]Hello.
[115:44.06]I'm gonna get you a little dog, too.
[115:58.17]Okay, any more of you guys want to do that to me?
[116:04.15]Alright, here comes the dog.
[116:05.23]Put on the Resin.
[116:07.03]Oh shit, I thought he didn't know.
[116:11.82]Apparently not.
[116:19.90]What?
[116:22.76]Come on, don't do this to me now.
[116:25.68]Oh, goodness.
[116:29.47]Now here comes the dog.
[116:33.50]Yeah, here he comes.
[116:37.23]Let's do it!
[116:40.13]You and me!
[116:40.63]God.
[116:42.39]Fuck that up, it's okay though.
[117:00.52]I can't see!
[117:06.70]Can't see!
[117:17.64]Can't see!
[117:19.42]Ah, it sucks when the ice gets right in the fucking way.
[117:43.16]Here's my chance.
[117:47.54]Psycho mode now.
[118:00.52]Ah, god damn it.
[118:04.64]The worst part about this fight is when your whole screen fills with ice and you literally cannot fucking see what he's doing.
[118:15.24]Once, like, the whole place fills with ice, good luck.
[118:18.44]Because you don't know what movie's doing next.
[118:26.07]Damn.
[118:27.65]Without that, this fight would be a lot easier.
[118:37.39]Shit.
[118:38.51]I'm gonna take a Blossom too.
[118:45.17]I wonder if it's possible to burn him down before the dog even gets here.
[118:48.69]It might be possible.
[119:04.47]I could do it.
[119:05.12]I just I'm just losing my patience cuz fuck this area That was just like the definition of impatience I
[119:28.42]I wonder if it's possible to die before the dog gets here.
[119:32.54]That's pretty much what I should have been saying.
[119:36.48]I gotta take a blossom when the dog comes so I can be ready to dodge.
[119:40.08]Oh, it's so boring.
[119:40.96]Okay, come out here.
[119:41.84]Let me just slowly kill your three dumb dogs.
[119:45.39]I swear to God they do this just to piss you off.
[119:48.65]I gotta kill three default stupid shit dogs.
[119:53.16]He's only here to annoy people.
[119:55.56]I want to fight the fucking boss, not three default enemies.
[120:04.08]Fuck.
[120:14.79]Shit.
[120:15.35]I think they moved three times in a row.
[120:21.35]Let's look at this RNG.
[120:24.77]No RNG here.
[120:36.33]Dog.
[120:37.31]I can't see.
[120:58.64]He shot me with a dump.
[120:59.84]Oh, no!
[121:01.16]No, I had dump blossoms on.
[121:04.94]I forgot to switch between the... God, he's just annoying enough to fuck the whole fight up.
[121:16.19]Oh, I didn't switch over?
[121:20.03]And he's just barely fucking irritating enough to fuck up the whole fight.
[121:25.40]God damn it.
[121:27.04]That was a good start, too.
[121:38.33]If I'd only had switched!
[121:39.85]Ugh!
[121:49.27]Fucking stupid-ass boss fight.
[121:53.70]Easy now, easy now.
[122:08.17]Shit.
[122:08.49]Already, man.
[122:09.15]I'm already overwhelmed.
[122:10.49]Fuck.
[122:21.76]Son of a bitch.
[122:23.88]I'm in trouble.
[122:26.96]Really?
[122:28.64]Really?
[122:30.59]Oh my god.
[122:32.29]I think I'm pretty much on full tilt right now.
[122:35.51]Yeah, I definitely am.
[122:37.03]I might as well go bake a fucking cake.
[122:42.68]He hasn't done a regular swing in ten swings.
[122:47.27]This is a no-go.
[122:54.13]I think I'm just gonna die.
[122:55.43]I'm pretty sure this is a no-go.
[123:04.56]I can't get hit one time by the dog.
[123:06.94]Now kill me.
[123:07.44]Kill me.
[123:07.88]Just end it.
[123:08.66]End my life.
[123:15.02]Just kill me.
[123:15.84]I gotta start over.
[123:17.90]This motherfucker didn't do a normal swing the whole fight.
[123:20.45]He did his, like, yay.
[123:23.67]I'm seriously gonna go, like, put that cake in the oven and then sit in it.
[123:27.67]I'm gonna sit in that fucking cake.
[123:34.97]Oh my god.
[123:43.36]Social eating.
[123:47.38]How many bosses are even in the DLC?
[123:48.68]Is this the only one or is there two?
[123:59.48]Alright, let's go.
[124:00.96]This time, I don't want to get fucked by RNG dogs.
[124:04.50]Just get over here.
[124:08.04]Okay.
[124:10.04]Let's have some fun.
[124:39.56]Can't parry that.
[124:41.00]Parry it again.
[124:41.92]Okay, come on now.
[125:01.49]Come on, my son.
[125:26.34]You can't parry that fucking move
[125:37.99]He keeps doing the stupid shield slam.
[125:40.97]Will you fuck off with the shield slam?
[125:43.14]I know you can do it.
[125:44.12]It's a cool move.
[125:44.88]You don't have to show it to me every fucking two seconds.
[125:48.54]Dickbag.
[126:16.78]Oh, this boss is so fucking hard.
[126:18.61]Oh my god.
[126:26.05]Anytime Dark Souls gives you more than one boss to deal with, it's usually the most annoying thing in the game.
[126:35.44]It's typically when there's more than two.
[126:38.52]More than one boss to deal with.
[126:40.24]It's always a pain in the fucking ass every time.
[126:49.24]Welcome to animal bosses.
[126:58.67]I just wish you didn't have to do this part every time.
[127:02.23]I wouldn't be as angry as I am right now.
[127:08.09]Where's the wolf valve that I can turn off so I don't have to do the beginning anymore?
[127:26.82]That still hurt me.
[127:28.74]I'm not sure why that still hurt.
[127:45.88]Damn it.
[127:46.10]It's so hard to tell if he's going to swing or do that.
[127:47.98]No, I just get screwed.
[127:51.95]I'm going to forget about the parries.
[128:36.55]I'm not gonna range really, fuck off.
[128:37.99]They're killing me smalls.
[129:13.44]Wait, where am I stuck on?
[129:42.23]God.
[129:47.09]What the fuck even is this boss?
[129:52.70]He's... It's just... I don't know about this one.
[129:59.88]I keep getting him to that point.
[130:01.64]You know, I almost feel like I kind of want to kill the little shit guy.
[130:08.71]I think I'm gonna try to kill the guy before the wolf even really lands.
[130:11.81]I gotta just try to burn him.
[130:16.15]That super dash that he does, when he does that like three times in a row, when you can't see.
[130:20.06]Ah!
[130:21.22]It's so fucking horrible.
[130:24.80]And then I got like stuck in between them.
[130:27.62]I was wedged in between both these two fucking idiots.
[130:32.50]I'm gonna go for that strategy though.
[130:33.78]I'm gonna try just to kill this guy before the wolf like really does anything to me.
[130:38.29]Dealing with them both is really... I have to be aware of where the hell they both are at all times.
[130:44.99]Give him some doggy treats.
[130:46.79]I could.
[131:15.07]Shit I just got combo'd Kill him come on
[131:41.45]Shit, I just fucking didn't have to stand over there.
[131:44.68]Is he at?
[131:53.94]No, I had it.
[131:55.12]I would have had it.
[131:56.73]So when he's doing his little call the wolf thing, you can eviscerate.
[131:59.87]Okay.
[132:03.33]This is going to be a real good attempt in this next one.
[132:05.91]Because I'm knowing that you can do that to him.
[132:09.66]No, you know what?
[132:10.06]Fuck it.
[132:10.24]I'm going to put bleed on.
[132:20.91]I'm going to bleed this fucking guy out.
[132:32.62]Because he just took a lot of damage right there.
[132:39.90]How many attempts did I have on the last boss?
[132:43.32]I think this is the most attempts I've ever had on a boss.
[132:46.13]What was Pontiff?
[132:46.77]Like 10?
[132:48.23]7?
[132:48.87]What attempt is this?
[132:49.55]At least like 6 or 7, right?
[132:53.53]This guy sucks asshole.
[132:55.93]Really.
[132:56.77]That just makes me seriously want to throw a rock through my own window.
[133:02.31]Dumb shit like that.
[133:05.14]I want to throw a brick through my own fucking window.
[133:07.78]And then call the cops and be like, Somebody just threw a brick through my window!
[133:20.94]Stupid fucking ice cube.
[133:29.33]Just being stupid that's all it is So hell-bent on hitting him with this bleed it's fucking up the rest of the fight for me God I'm so greedy right now.
[133:54.13]I'm just so done with this boss.
[133:55.21]Oh
[134:14.41]Katana!
[134:14.97]I'm coming to wall.
[134:24.27]Somehow he didn't hit me there.
[134:40.12]No, fuck!
[134:42.97]I'm trying to put on the fucking bleed again.
[134:45.85]There goes my weapon.
[135:09.26]I'm not close enough to hit him.
[136:00.46]I'm gonna put on frost resistance, maybe?
[136:02.24]I don't know.
[136:07.90]Jesus.
[136:08.60]Tap dancing Christ.
[136:20.27]No, that weighs too much.
[136:30.71]Mmm.
[136:32.83]How much do I weigh right now?
[136:40.54]See, the problem I'm having is I get close enough, but...
[136:47.49]I forgot about what he looked like.
[136:50.71]Okay, for a second I thought there was something wrong with my character.
[136:58.04]Is this just like straight up and down slash with the katana?
[137:02.76]It's kind of fucking my whole life over right now.
[137:17.85]I'm going to try this weapon.
[137:22.27]It's not really upgraded that well, but the katana is really starting to irritate me.
[137:32.73]I already had pretty good frost.
[137:35.21]Pontiff Knight.
[137:50.49]Give that a go.
[137:52.43]We'll try the bugha weapon.
[138:00.80]I mean, at least this has a swipe.
[138:02.74]It's not straight up and down.
[138:05.66]Give it a go.
[138:12.74]We'll give it a go.
[138:13.38]I wonder how many more times it's gonna take before I put a hammer through my monitor.
[138:19.04]What do you guys think?
[138:23.46]Like, when am I gonna go get like a hammer from my dad's workshop?
[138:30.38]Just like Hammer Brothers, my own screen.
[138:32.80]Yeah.
[138:54.87]Frank pizza!
[138:55.47]That wasn't a backstab, come on now.
[139:36.48]Really?
[139:37.86]Come on.
[139:39.89]Alright, here he comes.
[140:20.40]I want to break all these things.
[140:29.63]I feel like I should just shatter them.
[140:44.14]Break them all.
[140:46.16]Break all these fucking things, so you can't do that anymore.
[140:48.50]I don't know, run into anything and smash the shit.
[140:59.63]That just freaked me out so bad.
[141:01.61]You see that glacier that's flying in the air?
[141:08.39]Oh, he just screwed me.
[141:10.17]He just screwed me so bad.
[141:12.59]He hit me with like a little tap on my back.
[141:24.79]That was a mistake.
[141:37.65]Thought I had a chance.
[141:49.69]I had a chance for a second.
[142:18.26]Can't see can't see Yeah
[142:45.19]Cute.
[143:19.85]Oh no.
[143:28.66]Oh no.
[143:38.25]Sucks such asshole.
[143:47.17]I'm not sure where to go when he does that.
[143:52.34]You gotta run around him.
[143:56.68]Oh my god.
[143:58.56]But trying to decipher if he's gonna do that or the super de- You gotta run all the way around him.
[144:02.58]You gotta run in front of him.
[144:03.80]Okay.
[144:06.42]God damn it, man.
[144:07.28]This guy is fucking horrendous.
[144:15.69]You gotta go all the way around.
[144:20.93]Well, I got him much closer than last time.
[144:25.31]When he starts to cast that move, I'm going to his ass.
[144:29.59]It's just going to be hard to decipher which one he's going to do, because he stops for a second.
[144:36.52]Running backwards from it?
[144:38.84]I felt like that's what I was doing.
[144:39.64]You kind of have to get rid of lock-on, though, which scares the shit out of me at this guy.
[144:45.01]I think I got his combo down.
[144:48.05]Oh my god.
[144:49.89]Stupid wolves in the beginning.
[144:53.23]What are you doing?
[144:54.75]What the fuck was that?
[144:56.02]Just fucking sprinting in a circle around me.
[144:59.76]Oh, I'm so angry.
[145:00.84]I'm undeniably angry right now.
[145:06.98]You just have to use two flasks at this dumb shithead.
[145:14.25]You can just split around in a circle!
[145:18.13]Did you see what I could do?
[145:18.95]Look, it's funny!
[145:33.02]You can kinda screw him up there.
[145:42.60]Here he comes.
[145:47.28]Alright, forget about him.
[145:49.26]Where is he?
[145:52.00]I gotta get away from the wall.
[146:01.84]It's a terrible place to be.
[146:23.92]Casting this dumb icicle move.
[146:54.78]God, this is a disaster.
[146:59.56]My weapons aren't long enough to swing at him because he moves too fast.
[147:36.19]Ooh!
[147:41.41]What'd I do?
[147:43.72]Shh!
[147:44.04]Quiet!
[147:44.64]Quiet!
[147:46.24]You fucker!
[147:47.58]No!
[147:47.78]I didn't even see him!
[147:48.84]Didn't even know he was here!
[147:58.29]He was just in fucking front of me.
[148:00.60]Oh No No, you gotta be kidding me You gotta be fucking kidding me He appears out of the mist and fucking kills me I'm gonna fucking scream No Oh my god fuck this boss
[148:27.03]That was the one, too.
[148:28.35]He was dead.
[148:28.83]I just... The fog disappeared.
[148:33.68]And he was already attacking and just comboed the fuck out of me and I was stuck there.
[148:41.04]God damn it, man.
[148:44.02]We get it FromSoftware.
[148:45.08]You make hard games.
[148:46.36]Cool.
[148:48.80]Man, we get it.
[148:49.76]I get it.
[149:04.82]He can't handle those swings in a row.
[149:06.40]I just have to keep comboing him.
[149:13.02]Okay, that was not on Estus Flask.
[149:18.37]That was on Fire Enchantment.
[149:19.81]Oh my god.
[149:27.91]Dude.
[149:29.45]Oh my god.
[149:33.98]This is the most I think I've ever spent on a boss in Dark Souls 3.
[149:39.57]I'm pretty sure this is the most attempts out of any of the bosses I've ever done in the game.
[149:56.70]If I get to that point again, I'll kill him.
[149:59.28]No, no summons.
[150:00.10]I can beat this by myself.
[150:01.74]I've gotten close like two or three times now.
[150:09.74]You just can't get... What has to happen when the wolf comes out, I have to separate them or kill him as fast as I can.
[150:16.34]Because I'll get those stupid, dumb, fucking RNG moments where he just is where the wolf is and just spamming moves everywhere.
[150:22.65]Or sometimes he just stands completely still and doesn't do a goddamn thing.
[150:25.35]Like he did that last time, before this time, before that line.
[150:30.49]Before that guy, before this guy, before that guy.
[150:36.51]Did you hear the words?
[150:39.21]There was a couple.
[150:39.81]Shit, I was trying to fucking stagger him.
[151:03.02]I'm just rushing it now.
[151:25.20]It always sucks when you get to a boss like this because you're just so sick and fucking tired of fighting this part of the boss.
[151:31.16]I don't want to fight this guy.
[151:32.18]I want to fight the wolf.
[151:33.68]Why can't he just lamb?
[151:37.04]You just get so done with these first little stupid shit encounters that you don't want to do the next part.
[151:41.91]Here he comes, and he's got fucking half health.
[151:43.91]I'm in so much trouble.
[151:46.27]Pray to the whale.
[152:07.87]I tried to dodge.
[152:17.60]That guy is gonna give me a fucking aneurysm.
[152:37.41]Here he comes again.
[152:38.11]I gotta separate them here.
[152:39.89]I don't even know where he is.
[152:44.01]There you go.
[152:44.47]So he's gonna do it again, isn't he?
[152:54.03]I gotta get out of this corner.
[153:00.56]God damn.
[153:06.23]Fuck this fucking bus!
[153:13.88]Fuck this guy!
[153:24.04]I found- I happened to find myself back into that same fucking corner too.
[153:30.17]The exact same thing played out.
[153:32.05]Except this time.
[153:33.77]Oh.
[153:36.19]The boss decided to sprint in a circle a hundred times.
[153:43.87]Suddenly a wolf.
[153:50.32]Roll under him when he breathes on you.
[153:51.76]Well, the problem is just having to constantly get harassed by that.
[153:58.66]I have to kill the guy.
[153:59.98]There's no way around it.
[154:01.50]I have to fucking kill the guy.
[154:05.28]I just have to dodge the wolf and not do any lock-on.
[154:08.57]And kill the guy.
[154:09.11]Because he seriously is a... I seriously want to dunk this guy's fucking head in acid.
[154:18.32]Yeah.
[154:44.62]Okay, here he comes.
[154:46.96]Come on.
[154:49.55]Bullshit.
[154:50.81]That is bullshit.
[154:57.85]That's some bullshit.
[155:00.64]He did his, like, super spin move three times in a row.
[155:03.90]Get dunked in acid.
[155:20.48]That dumb move.
[155:43.31]I didn't even know he could do that.
[155:44.91]I didn't even know he could do that fucking move.
[156:08.94]Oh my god.
[156:09.82]It's not fucking fair.
[156:18.72]I was lying on the ground.
[156:20.36]And I stood up.
[156:22.74]I was in the middle of the animation already.
[156:28.40]Take out the little... That was the plan.
[156:30.20]Until... Until it wasn't.
[156:38.61]I know I always say it, but I always switch to the wolf.
[156:40.27]I know, it's just... It's too hard to keep track of when he's gonna do his moves.
[156:47.18]It's just such a disaster, this whole fight.
[157:12.39]Still had stamina to do that?
[157:13.39]Are you shitting me?
[157:18.85]Can you, like, even backstab this guy?
[157:33.96]Here we go.
[157:39.60]I got really greedy there.
[157:41.68]And I almost just got insta-crushed by the wolf.
[157:48.87]What is he doing?
[157:55.13]What's the wolf doing?
[158:04.17]Dah!
[158:19.55]I gotta have him dodge.
[158:21.29]The wolf has to do that move where he goes by me.
[158:27.31]I can't.
[158:29.71]I can't right now.
[158:30.65]He needs one hit!
[158:34.49]Do it.
[158:41.29]He's in the middle of a goddamn combo move.
[158:45.96]He's dead.
[158:46.88]He's dead.
[158:47.32]He's dead.
[158:47.62]Fucking wolf killed him.
[159:11.57]Thank you.
[159:43.97]so so so
[160:15.49]Oh, my God.
[160:41.99]I thought he was doing the breath.
[161:05.17]God damn it, it's so hard to do this.
[161:06.79]It's so hard to tell if he's gonna do the breath or not.
[161:11.82]I'm just gonna run backwards when he does it.
[161:30.87]That's what it is, you gotta run backwards.
[161:49.72]What an idiot!
[161:51.14]He ran right by me!
[162:05.14]This game's wicked fucking easy.
[162:06.23]It's like the easiest game I've ever played.
[162:15.07]I hate this game.
[162:17.80]I don't ever want to play this game again.
[162:26.59]I was quiet as a fucking mouse.
[162:31.63]Seems familiar.
[162:32.39]Time for tears.
[162:33.25]Oh, I was on complete... Somebody put me in a soda can and shook me up and poured the Sprite all over their penis.
[162:40.62]And by the way, they put it in the microwave first.
[162:42.02]It was boiling hot.
[162:45.62]Is there anything else to do down here?
[162:46.82]I got like a symbol of something.
[162:53.95]Oh, that's... Fuck that, boss.
[162:57.51]I don't think there's anything else here.
[163:04.70]How many attempts was that?
[163:13.26]Calm down, Jerem.
[163:14.40]I'm good.
[163:16.60]If I turn my... You guys want to see how fucking sweaty I am right now?
[163:20.00]I guarantee you there's sweat on my face.
[163:23.80]Let's take a look.
[163:26.73]Let's see how much sweat is all over my face right now.
[163:31.45]I bet you it's unbearable.
[163:38.93]Is it?
[163:40.46]Look at this.
[163:43.18]Fuck that guy.
[163:44.52]Fuck that boss and fuck this game.
[163:47.10]I don't want to play this anymore.
[163:48.82]I'm done playing it.
[163:50.96]Good night.
[163:51.42]No, I'm just kidding.
[163:54.29]Ugh.
[163:58.39]Not even in the right spot.
[164:01.31]Whatever.
[164:01.57]I'll put it over here.
[164:02.39]That's the better place.
[164:03.09]It's right there.
[164:11.91]never again tinder's gonna see no they won't oh how much yeah it's not too bad it's a little bit of grease not like not like a hundred percent sweat mode
[164:41.67]But thank you to... Let me move this around.
[164:51.21]Thank you to AloneSomeBirthdayParty.
[164:56.35]Thanks for the sub, dude.
[164:58.90]Sweet, sweet victory.
[164:59.78]Thank you, Haterius.
[165:02.72]I'm Juana.
[165:03.16]Thanks for the sub.
[165:04.06]Thanks to NeedsMeek for the bits.
[165:05.58]And Roy Treneman.
[165:09.10]Zycron...
[165:10.08]Thanks, both of you guys, for the subscriptions.
[165:11.42]Tritanics!
[165:13.27]Eight months in a row.
[165:14.09]You stream so much now.
[165:15.05]Twitch texts me more than my friends.
[165:18.67]Well... I'm glad to be your new text buddy.
[165:23.59]Thanks a lot, BeanDip.
[165:24.58]And also, FrankPizza.
[165:25.36]I said hi to FrankPizza.
[165:28.98]I think I got everybody during that whole period where I was out of my fucking mind mad.
[165:34.74]I was, guys, you know, like, oh, like, Jerma gets mad.
[165:37.61]Oh, he's mad.
[165:38.77]I was actually furious right there.
[165:40.05]I was really mad and upset.
[165:43.03]Game crashed.
[165:43.47]No, it didn't.
[165:43.95]I'm fine.
[165:45.94]I would have thrown up if the game just crashed right there.
[165:49.38]Also, fuck the katana.
[165:51.30]I think we found a new weapon.
[165:52.74]I'm going to upgrade this, because the katanas really start to annoy the hell out of me.
[166:08.50]um let's go back to firelink champions grave tender yeah so I got an item what was the item I got by the way I can't use the blacksmith until I pay 90 000 souls because I killed them in the end of my last playthrough
[166:33.12]Like, look at this.
[166:35.50]I can't do anything about this.
[166:36.80]I have to go give 87,000 souls.
[166:43.10]How much do I need to level up?
[166:51.09]I can do it once.
[166:53.33]I really, really, really desperately need to go...
[167:00.09]How many souls will I get for these?
[167:01.31]Let's find out.
[167:03.01]7,000.
[167:05.43]I hope you guys are ready for the coward stream.
[167:10.78]Because if I don't get to 90,000 here, then we're going to be wicked bad cowards.
[167:15.92]This might do it.
[167:24.14]No.
[167:25.59]Alright, I need like 10, 9,000 souls.
[167:33.83]I have to go spend these souls to pray.
[167:38.61]Let's try not to die.
[167:39.45]You ready for the coward stream?
[167:47.85]Where is it?
[167:48.27]I think it's right here.
[167:55.81]My room, I'm not kidding, is heated up to like 89 degrees.
[168:07.90]We need to farm for a little bit just so I can use the blacksmith because I'm an idiot.
[168:11.98]Just kill random dumb people.
[168:21.08]Go to the rat cave.
[168:22.10]If I fall off a cliff... Don't even say that.
[168:30.34]Now I'm paranoid.
[168:35.89]Because we're going to upgrade the booger weapon.
[168:38.47]The little, like, snot that somebody got pulled out of a giant's nose.
[168:44.59]Alright, here are the rats.
[168:49.91]Alright, we need more.
[168:52.57]Need more souls.
[168:59.25]87,000.
[168:59.55]To be exact.
[169:03.61]Dog.
[169:03.93]Come on, dog.
[169:04.49]Jump down.
[169:06.28]There's really no danger here.
[169:11.60]The only danger is if I fall off the bridge.
[169:15.20]And by golly gee, if I do that... I'll turn off the stream.
[169:21.73]I will turn the stream off in rage if I fall off this bridge.
[169:26.25]You heard it here first.
[169:36.41]I'm going to hit these guys once.
[169:37.55]There's Ursula.
[169:43.01]Come here, Ursula.
[169:48.90]Okay.
[169:50.20]Need some more.
[169:50.92]Alright, so on a scale of 1 to 10, how...
[170:04.76]Like, how mad was I actually, like, during that fight?
[170:09.08]Like, not like, oh, funny, he's, like, getting a little mad, he's, like, getting irritated.
[170:12.06]How full-on, like, scale of 1 to 10, was it, like, a 7 or an 8?
[170:15.72]How angry was I?
[170:16.38]It probably was, like, a full-on, like, 9.2.
[170:18.84]In my opinion. 7.
[170:36.60]9, 9, 11, 8, 11.
[170:36.82]I keep seeing 8, 7, 11 doesn't count.
[170:38.96]I said 1 to 10.
[170:40.38]I'm invincible dog.
[170:41.08]Okay, don't fucking make a joke here.
[171:03.25]There's a time for living.
[171:05.46]And there's a time for dying.
[171:09.04]And your time has come.
[171:11.86]I'm not even going to attempt to kill that guy.
[171:14.86]He can be free over there on the edge of the lip of the bridge.
[171:21.32]I think I have to reset it.
[171:22.20]Yeah, I do.
[171:26.64]Reset.
[171:27.56]Do it again.
[171:28.32]And this time I probably will be at like 85 or 86.
[171:30.18]But it's very important.
[171:33.68]that I upgrade this weapon.
[171:42.83]Can you re-rage so I can rate?
[171:44.33]It's funny, I made the joke in the very beginning when I turned on the stream.
[171:53.37]That, like, oh, fuck!
[171:54.71]Fuck this game!
[171:55.51]This game sucks!
[171:56.21]Fucking stupid boss!
[171:57.95]Streaming!
[171:59.61]And that is exactly what happened.
[172:04.47]Jokes aside, I was that guy that was really mad at Dark Souls on stream.
[172:09.61]It's just what happened.
[172:25.10]Okay.
[172:26.36]Be careful with that.
[172:29.60]You don't want to get yourself in trouble.
[172:34.69]Did I find it?
[172:35.13]Yeah, I know where the statue is.
[172:36.13]I already got the key, the door's already open.
[172:37.99]I just have to get 87,000 souls to be able to unlock the blacksmith again.
[172:55.09]Why did I shout streaming in rage?
[172:59.78]That's what happens when you play Dark Souls 3 blind on stream.
[173:05.90]Here's the funny thing about Dark Souls.
[173:08.68]Anytime you play this game, you have to justify a thousand times why the thing you're doing wasn't wrong, why the game is being mean to you.
[173:20.28]Right?
[173:20.74]When you die to a boss, you find every possible reason why it wasn't your fault.
[173:29.72]No, it didn't even count.
[173:31.10]Fucking stupid like the dogs in the beginning.
[173:33.46]They should just delete it from the game.
[173:34.86]It's a stupid encounter.
[173:36.14]That's what you do.
[173:36.70]You self-justify.
[173:38.10]Makes you feel a little better.
[173:41.60]Made me feel a lot better, actually.
[173:49.57]And you cry in your corner.
[173:50.81]And you find solace knowing that you, uh... You know?
[174:00.02]I don't know.
[174:02.40]In your boundless rage.
[174:06.67]Alright, come on pot bros.
[174:08.25]Let's go.
[174:17.06]Bring over the Seesaw.
[174:18.02]The Hee Haw Seesaw.
[174:31.88]No, we're not fighting over here.
[174:34.12]Everyone is a game designer when they play Dark Souls.
[174:37.92]It's true.
[174:38.44]But I mean, I think there are some things.
[174:45.21]Yeah, there's a lot of times when you'll say things like that and you're just being an idiot and you're just being mad at the game.
[174:52.17]But there are some things that you kind of have to wonder.
[174:54.41]Like, what the hell?
[174:56.34]Like, what the hell is this?
[174:57.96]Like, I will... I'm gonna go down and say that, like, those... The three dogs... What the hell is this?
[175:07.98]What is that?
[175:09.56]Does it have to be there?
[175:10.24]Couldn't it have just been one dog?
[175:12.96]Or two dogs?
[175:13.64]It has to be three.
[175:15.91]And they just do the random nonsense that they do.
[175:18.09]Does it have to be three dogs?
[175:21.37]Not everything has to be three FromSoftware.
[175:24.87]Star Wars, there were three.
[175:26.19]I understand.
[175:26.65]But you don't have to have that.
[175:29.44]Star Trek, there were three episodes.
[175:33.34]I get it.
[175:33.66]There were three Dark Souls games.
[175:38.84]I feel ya.
[175:43.37]But fuck off.
[175:43.95]Alright, one more time.
[175:54.98]Are we reenacting the Dark Souls 3 video?
[175:59.98]Did I say it?
[176:00.48]Have I said this already?
[176:02.44]I probably did.
[176:03.00]I'm just regressing back to when I played Dark Souls 3 last time.
[176:15.20]Wait, there were three dogs.
[176:20.69]There was only two dogs that I got bad at in the last game, I thought.
[176:30.37]Almost there.
[176:31.21]I love this little golf swing you do at this thing.
[176:39.95]Yeah, this is definitely a weapon of choice from now on.
[176:46.99]I got the Alzheimer's too low.
[176:49.80]Ah, shit.
[176:50.42]He's starting to repeat himself.
[176:53.62]Take him out back.
[176:57.15]Take him out back before he starts buying slot machine coins.
[177:01.29]In an online casino game.
[177:13.20]I'm going to let you have that one later.
[177:19.41]These guys should do it on the bridge and then I could get out of here finally.
[177:44.24]I just did the Marv from home alone scream You guys are home alone, but he's getting electrocuted.
[177:55.15]Okay, slow it down Jesus
[178:09.22]He turns into the skeleton.
[178:11.10]I'm sorry.
[178:11.68]I'm sorry.
[178:12.58]I really thought I was going down there.
[178:22.41]Oh, shit.
[178:24.47]Wow.
[178:25.17]My head hurts right now.
[178:28.93]Okay, you know when you wake up from a nightmare?
[178:31.97]And for one second, you still think you're in the- you think you're in the nightmare still?
[178:36.56]There's a guy chasing you with an axe.
[178:38.50]And you're like, no, this guy's got an axe, he's gonna kill me!
[178:41.46]Don't, please!
[178:42.28]Eyes open.
[178:43.10]Where's the guy with the axe?
[178:44.10]He's here, he's in the room!
[178:46.02]I really just thought I died.
[178:47.46]Again.
[178:48.04]Like, right now, I was like, I died, no I didn't.
[178:50.06]Okay, thank god.
[178:54.53]Put that in the folder.
[178:57.90]Alright, I'm gonna go to a less dangerous spot, just to kill the rats one more time.
[179:18.62]Yeah.
[179:21.30]Thanks a lot, SteerGameFreak, for the sub.
[179:23.62]And thanks, PremiumPillow, for all the bits.
[179:26.60]Play nice for the bits, and yell a bit for the bits.
[179:28.44]Not the guy that gave the bits, and this guy that gave the bits.
[179:31.49]That guy just gave some bits.
[179:34.55]Hi.
[179:41.03]Is that gonna do it?
[179:42.37]Give me the 87, please.
[179:44.63]So I can stop this madness.
[179:50.26]Gotta kill one guy on the bridge, and then I can finally get out of here.
[180:07.69]This... over here, I can turn around, one of these guys, goodbye.
[180:11.17]Nope, not quite.
[180:18.22]I just subbed because of that sound you made?
[180:19.94]Well, thanks.
[180:21.08]Where's the fat lady?
[180:26.82]Fat lady.
[180:28.26]Excuse me, fat lady.
[180:31.54]Why am I... Why am I farming here?
[180:35.15]Because I just want to get the souls because the door that I need to go in is right here.
[180:40.19]This little group will do it.
[180:42.07]This one person potentially might do it.
[180:47.21]No, I gotta kill this guy with the pot.
[180:49.73]Come on, pot guy.
[180:51.97]Come on over here.
[180:53.17]Let's have some fun.
[180:54.40]Alright, will you please...
[181:08.68]It's unfair when there's two of you doing that.
[181:14.46]I just need to kill one of you idiots.
[181:16.54]Please.
[181:17.46]Get away from me.
[181:20.56]Run away.
[181:21.12]87,000.
[181:21.14]This dude's going to follow me, isn't he?
[181:29.09]All the way through.
[181:30.55]Wouldn't be surprised.
[181:34.65]You guys ready to spend all of our souls we just got to make it so we can enable the blacksmith again?
[181:41.93]Because of the funny joke I did at the end of the last one I beat the guy.
[181:45.85]Invading another world.
[181:46.61]What the fuck are you talking about?
[181:56.29]No.
[181:57.87]No, I'm not invading another world.
[182:00.33]No, I'm not.
[182:01.83]I wanted to pray to the statue.
[182:03.00]I prayed to the statue right now.
[182:05.86]What the fuck is going on right now?
[182:11.86]No, this is not good.
[182:13.77]Not cool.
[182:14.61]Where's the thing to break the... Where's the thing to break this?
[182:19.73]Get me out of here.
[182:21.05]No.
[182:26.13]Not a chance in hell.
[182:37.01]pray to the statue absolution forgive my sins if I had gotten there and he was just there and killed me I would have shit my pants on camera one of you guys are just trying to do that were you one of you guys just tried to like no okay it's my covenant right okay makes sense alright there go 90,000 souls down the drain
[183:06.51]How's that blacksmith doing now?
[183:17.80]Back to bed.
[183:18.60]Let's go.
[183:25.77]Uh, where is it?
[183:33.80]No, that's where I am now.
[183:35.48]Where's the, uh... Okay.
[183:40.16]So, this is where I was.
[183:45.64]I'm playing on PC.
[183:48.80]If you're curious.
[183:50.60]Thank you, Animose.
[183:52.29]Animose for the subscription.
[183:53.37]Welcome.
[183:59.14]Alright.
[184:01.12]Is there anything I can do here that's done?
[184:03.82]Not done.
[184:06.96]Any other spots I can go to?
[184:08.20]Or is this just the boss area?
[184:09.44]If it is, I have to go back to where I was.
[184:11.04]And I'm going to go back to the bridge.
[184:14.98]Wait, what's up here?
[184:15.88]Can I get up there?
[184:19.65]Is that a spot I can go up?
[184:21.87]No.
[184:22.87]Back to the bridge.
[184:23.69]I'm going to go down and around it.
[184:27.56]Although, wait a minute.
[184:28.10]Wait a minute.
[184:28.44]Wait a minute.
[184:28.76]Wait a minute.
[184:29.74]Wait a minute.
[184:30.26]Wait a minute.
[184:31.00]Wait a minute.
[184:34.90]I have an item now.
[184:38.00]Didn't it say I needed... Can I go in the painting now?
[184:40.02]Can I go up to the cathedral?
[184:44.28]I wonder.
[184:46.08]I'm curious.
[184:46.32]I'm going to go to the cathedral.
[184:48.88]Hey, Panda221.
[184:49.70]Thanks for the subscription, dude.
[184:51.64]Let me check the cathedral.
[185:05.94]Jerm, I need to go cook some food for me.
[185:07.17]Take a whole 15 minute break.
[185:10.63]It actually might take me 15 minutes to find the next area.
[185:13.75]So I think it'd be alright.
[185:23.96]Yeah.
[185:26.38]Tailbone, short sword, valor heart.
[185:31.50]This looks like a... What the hell is this?
[185:39.60]Lion stance is the dumb thing that you go... I don't want it.
[185:44.02]Actually, let me try it.
[185:45.16]Let me just put it on.
[185:47.42]12, 12 scales of strength.
[185:48.88]Eh.
[185:49.56]Strength and dex.
[185:58.37]Okay.
[186:00.19]So then you just... You hold the shield up.
[186:10.91]Kind of cool.
[186:11.45]I'm not sure I really care for it, though.
[186:19.07]Not sure I care for it.
[186:22.01]Back to the booger weapon.
[186:25.75]Damn, actually.
[186:26.33]120, 58.
[186:26.39]154, 102.
[186:26.45]This thing doesn't even have... It's not even plus one.
[186:44.90]We'll have to take a look at that again.
[186:46.00]Because that thing seems to be very high raw damage.
[186:53.42]Where's that ladder?
[186:59.25]First time subbing?
[187:00.03]Well, thanks.
[187:00.73]I appreciate it.
[187:02.85]Thanks for choosing me.
[187:06.45]block frames on the attack.
[187:07.57]Alright, can I do anything up here now that I killed that dumb cow boss?
[187:14.49]No.
[187:21.52]Well, looks like we're going back to the bridge.
[187:31.70]Donald Trump is invading me right now.
[187:34.62]Oh, hi.
[187:36.49]You don't look very much like Donald Trump.
[187:41.35]I mean, you kind of got the hair.
[187:45.84]But, you know.
[187:47.50]I couldn't even R1 him.
[187:48.32]I couldn't even attack him.
[187:48.96]I couldn't even attack him, guys.
[187:51.32]No, I'm kidding.
[187:52.38]Like, I couldn't even R1 him.
[187:56.36]I have no idea.
[187:57.58]I could not.
[187:58.36]I literally could not R1.
[187:59.94]I was pressing and nothing was happening.
[188:02.23]I couldn't even swing.
[188:09.04]Do I get the money from Twitch Prime?
[188:10.20]Yes, I do.
[188:13.80]Twitch Prime goes to the broadcaster.
[188:16.34]Yes, it does.
[188:21.79]So let me see what that was all about.
[188:27.95]I couldn't even swing here.
[188:30.16]It was mashing R1.
[188:31.44]It didn't do anything.
[188:35.52]Thank God you dumped all the 90k souls.
[188:37.10]Oh my God, I know.
[188:39.69]Alright, I got another item, didn't I?
[188:51.64]Champions?
[188:52.16]Bones?
[188:54.92]Didn't I?
[188:55.30]What?
[188:58.94]Some of this random shit, I don't even know what the item was.
[189:07.15]Burn at the fire links.
[189:07.99]Well, I'm going to burn whatever the hell this is.
[189:10.82]Let's burn it.
[189:11.22]It was a partial parry.
[189:27.72]Well, let's burn this thing.
[189:31.80]Burn undead bone shard.
[189:33.74]Burn champion's bones.
[189:36.06]No, I mean champion.
[189:37.09]Burn champion's bones.
[189:40.95]Undead match.
[189:43.11]Match format.
[189:43.91]One-on-one arena.
[189:47.61]Dual... Oh.
[189:54.09]So this is just... This is just PvP.
[189:56.37]I unlocked the PvP arena.
[190:00.66]Well.
[190:02.22]Okay.
[190:06.28]I guess we're going to the arena.
[190:07.32]Yeah.
[190:09.38]Thank you, Aronius25.
[190:11.18]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[190:16.94]This reminds me of the area in Bloodborne where Amigdala is.
[190:20.00]Cool.
[190:24.02]Alright, let's go!
[190:36.83]Ugh!
[190:42.75]OH NO!
[190:46.16]I got him with the 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2!
[190:55.56]Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha!
[190:58.92]Burpo!
[190:59.66]I forgot that was my name.
[191:04.95]Okay, that was fun.
[191:08.01]That's the end of the game?
[191:10.61]What?
[191:15.88]No, I beat the whole thing?
[191:21.57]No.
[191:23.57]I didn't.
[191:26.45]I still had another place to go, right?
[191:32.31]Isn't there a whole other place to go?
[191:33.43]I didn't beat the DLC, did I?
[191:44.23]Somebody tell me what's going on here.
[191:59.70]Okay, where was I going?
[192:01.32]I think I could go this way.
[192:08.26]I just want to check over here.
[192:09.64]Hold on, no, sorry.
[192:12.89]Bird village?
[192:13.47]Oh, yeah.
[192:16.03]I just want to see what's over here.
[192:17.31]Because I don't think I went all the way over here.
[192:18.91]Yeah, we'll go back to the bird people.
[192:24.55]I just want to look.
[192:26.25]I'm curious if there's anything here.
[192:33.17]Oh, this is delightful.
[192:34.88]Yeah, I remember the tree lady that freaks out.
[192:36.74]Yep, remember that.
[192:37.58]I don't think there's anything else over here, so let's just kill the psycho tree person.
[193:06.16]See that cartwheel?
[193:06.90]It was intentional.
[193:13.09]And that's it.
[193:13.57]I just... I died over here.
[193:14.75]I just want to make sure there's nothing else over there.
[193:21.09]Dark Souls.
[193:30.02]What about this ladder?
[193:34.42]If we climb it.
[193:36.56]Yes, I will.
[193:39.98]This lady's gonna breathe her bad breath fire at me when I climb.
[193:50.13]Don't even tell me she could climb the tree.
[193:53.11]This is a long, long ladder.
[194:06.68]Climb.
[194:08.72]Hello.
[194:11.76]What's up here?
[194:14.50]Ooh, I remember.
[194:20.86]Hmm.
[194:24.24]A way up.
[194:27.92]Snake eater?
[194:28.57]A tree climbing tree.
[194:36.51]Who built that ladder was a champ.
[194:37.83]Yeah, you have to... You can't... Here's what you have to do to make these ladders.
[194:41.23]Somebody has to just make them enormous and huge and, like, just drop it down and hope it stays.
[194:48.22]This thing falls backwards and just crashes.
[194:50.56]You kind of have to put your hands in the air and be like, well, shit, I tried.
[194:59.15]Titanite slab.
[195:00.47]Ooh.
[195:02.53]Bugs.
[195:09.57]You're not dead.
[195:14.09]Well, there's the Titanite slab.
[195:16.53]For all of you watching.
[195:17.71]There it is.
[195:19.97]Spoiler alert.
[195:27.59]Can't wait to get this dumb weapon up to plus 10.
[195:33.35]Okay.
[195:34.21]Now, let me think here.
[195:36.85]Don't think I went down there.
[195:37.73]Can I go down there?
[195:42.19]Is it possible?
[195:44.27]Oh man, he's going to bird town.
[195:52.36]He's on his way to bird town.
[196:00.69]Invading another world.
[196:01.85]Why am I invading another world?
[196:05.73]Can I like take off my watchdog?
[196:07.51]I wanna like play Dark Souls 3.
[196:13.02]Why is it sub only mode?
[196:13.84]Because I'm trying to avoid spoilers and... Okay, cool.
[196:28.78]So me and this guy are on a team.
[196:30.54]Versus the orange guy.
[196:36.20]That guy has a huge lightsaber fire blade.
[196:41.86]I'll do it.
[196:43.73]This is a crab here too.
[196:45.69]Who the hell is that guy?
[196:53.47]Forget about this guy.
[196:54.53]Fight this dude.
[196:58.63]I'm getting crabbed right now.
[197:02.37]He drank.
[197:02.73]He drank.
[197:03.09]I can drink.
[197:04.19]That's the rule.
[197:09.39]If you see a guy spam potions, you can too.
[197:20.28]What the hell this guy's just got maracas now What
[197:41.46]Look, I don't want to do it like that.
[197:43.47]You want to do it like that?
[197:45.11]We can't do it like that.
[197:52.35]Just kill me so I can get the fuck out of here.
[197:53.89]You didn't think I had a crab friend, did you?
[198:00.23]You didn't think I had a crab friend, did you?
[198:04.63]Come on, crab friend.
[198:05.63]Get him.
[198:06.47]Get him, crab.
[198:09.29]Kill this guy, too.
[198:12.82]Oh, you didn't think I had a crab friend.
[198:15.15]And that's how I win.
[198:18.77]Done.
[198:20.33]The crab got him.
[198:21.39]The fucking crab killed him.
[198:24.31]And I get credit for it.
[198:30.01]Honestly, really.
[198:31.11]That's not cool.
[198:31.69]They just throw you right in.
[198:32.57]Where's like the five seconds of immunity?
[198:42.21]I should have got my five minutes of immunity.
[198:44.06]Five seconds of immunity.
[198:46.26]I think this is the bird town, right?
[198:47.18]Am I going the right way?
[198:48.16]I think I am.
[198:52.68]Jerma and the giant crab.
[198:53.70]The two tag team champions of the WWF.
[198:59.72]Was this bird town?
[199:01.42]Kind of.
[199:02.02]I think it is.
[199:03.00]I haven't even been down here, so it has to be, right?
[199:05.22]Yeah, it is.
[199:05.58]Hopefully there's a bonfire down here, because I need to go back and upgrade this weapon.
[199:16.07]Take off the covenant ring?
[199:16.87]Yeah, good idea.
[199:22.43]It's off.
[199:23.23]No more of that.
[199:23.78]These things are freaking me out.
[199:42.32]I don't like these things.
[199:46.38]Then I guess this boss is gonna be like a giant bird thing, right?
[199:52.03]Krusty Krabbed.
[199:53.85]Hey, Kawai!
[199:56.29]Dang!
[199:59.11]God, I want that item.

[217:37.81]Foxafury, thanks for nine months.
[217:38.95]What do you want to name the new child, Fox?
[217:40.29]Well, Foxafury, how about... Foxafury Jr.
[217:43.11]That was so lame.
[217:44.55]I just said your name and added Jr.
[217:46.00]to it.
[217:46.32]Um, no.
[217:47.26]How about... Um... David.
[217:52.14]Baby David.
[217:53.60]He's our new baby.
[218:03.56]I think the dumb cartwheeling freaks me out.
[218:09.16]This guy does magic.
[218:13.14]That one little magic spell he did.
[218:16.58]He tried so hard to cast a teeny bolt at me.
[218:22.62]Now I'm like sad.
[218:23.59]I don't want to even kill these things.
[218:26.19]It's depressing me.
[218:31.45]Go that way.
[218:32.13]Yeah, let's see what's over here.
[218:34.77]Not as well, right?
[218:44.21]Mmm, I can go over there.
[218:47.01]Looks like I can jump.
[218:48.25]Twice.
[218:48.95]Let's clear this and see.
[218:52.85]Wait a minute, I was already in here, wasn't I?
[218:57.16]Homeless magician?
[219:00.10]Yeah.
[219:03.26]He does look like a homeless magician.
[219:05.81]What is this turtle shell that I have?
[219:12.20]I don't understand where I got the turtle shell from.
[219:26.34]Speaking of magicians.
[219:35.26]What do you got?
[219:39.12]Ooh.
[219:39.20]I hope I didn't just change my mind forever, but what I...
[219:46.48]Ah, damn it.
[219:49.48]These are so cool.
[219:54.27]I immediately regret not being able to use these.
[220:00.63]Well, let it be known that these are up here and they're fucking awesome.
[220:08.40]That's too bad.
[220:08.90]Oh well.
[220:12.20]For another time.
[220:16.43]Those are super cool though.
[220:18.75]I think that's all that's up here.
[220:25.02]Yes.
[220:26.00]Yes.
[220:27.58]And less.
[220:27.94]Wait a minute.
[220:28.26]No.
[220:32.58]Yeah.
[220:32.96]Okay.
[220:33.24]I'll climb up this one.
[220:36.98]Right bumper spam.
[220:38.40]The weapon.
[220:42.88]Ladder to there.
[220:44.79]Could just climb that.
[220:49.16]Is there anything else to do in here?
[220:52.02]Ah, here's the door that I couldn't open in the beginning.
[220:56.49]So there's that.
[220:57.45]I'm going to go refresh and go up there again because I just opened that door.
[221:05.83]Cool.
[221:11.26]Go refill Estus's.
[221:16.06]Nothing wrong with right bumper spam.
[221:19.80]That's how Columbus discovered America.
[221:23.02]He mashed on right bumper.
[221:25.62]And his ship started going in a random direction.
[221:27.74]And he ran into America.
[221:35.90]I'm gonna go down here and climb this.
[221:39.34]I don't want to disturb this bird.
[221:48.62]From here, I think I can walk across, maybe, and jump?
[221:54.30]Oh boy, okay.
[221:55.22]I forgot these guys all spawn.
[221:56.88]Forget about the birds.
[221:57.74]Just do the task.
[222:08.68]Columbus discovered America?
[222:11.48]That's what was in the history books for all of us.
[222:14.68]Christopher Columbus.
[222:17.76]You got the Freddy Klu- Freddy Kluger Claws.
[222:22.90]Pressed R1 a bunch of times.
[222:26.66]Boom!
[222:28.09]Right into the continent.
[222:37.31]What the hell was I just doing right there?
[222:38.51]Why would I do that?
[222:39.05]I just like, did a dive.
[222:43.03]I think we're going over the wall now.
[222:44.11]We should be in a yummy cookie.
[222:59.30]I should have discovered America better.
[223:06.76]Well, that's a guy that lands there.
[223:08.36]Cool.
[223:08.84]Nice.
[223:17.91]At least it's easy to get back to.
[223:19.03]I was waiting for that.
[223:29.59]That's not nice.
[223:30.29]You should have spammed in the chat.
[223:32.29]Jerma, look out behind you.
[223:33.27]This is not the right way.
[223:37.02]I want to be going that way.
[223:42.14]Toddler gaming skills.
[223:43.60]What?
[223:44.34]How was I supposed to know that was going to happen?
[223:47.79]I got scarecrowed in front of my face.
[223:49.85]He jumped down and got me.
[223:56.01]Skip all this mess.
[223:59.13]Get him here.
[223:59.79]Do it again.
[224:02.51]Demon's Souls 3.
[224:06.49]Look how behind he is.
[224:08.65]Let's get topped off.
[224:10.63]We're going to have to discover America.
[224:17.71]This is bait right here.
[224:19.55]Forget about it.
[224:20.80]You guys ready?
[224:21.20]3, 2, 1.
[224:23.26]What's that?
[224:29.50]What's that in front of my face?
[224:31.70]Is that Massachusetts?
[224:33.89]Is that Vermont?
[224:40.81]He's not dead.
[224:43.63]Forget about the celebrations at the moment.
[224:51.65]There's where I need to go.
[224:53.73]Shit.
[224:57.74]Good joke.
[225:03.62]Ah, no.
[225:13.31]I win!
[225:22.16]Oh, he's right here.
[225:23.16]Hold on.
[225:23.80]Let's see.
[225:24.20]Can I win again?
[225:24.82]He just breached all the way through.
[225:41.57]He can reach through this whole thing.
[225:43.27]This is a terrible place to fight him.
[225:49.14]I just want to get away from him.
[225:50.80]And by the way, that didn't even do anything for me.
[225:55.20]How am I supposed to get around this?
[225:56.64]Up there?
[225:57.06]Okay, figured it out.
[225:59.64]Ooh, there's an item there too.
[226:02.26]Alright, I'm gonna go back around.
[226:04.64]I'm gonna kill these things though, because I don't want them to be around when I... Scratching my nose.
[226:09.23]Itchy nose.
[226:09.63]Alright, fine.
[226:14.21]Fuck off.
[226:14.89]Dead.
[226:17.52]So, I need to be up that way.
[226:19.22]So, go up there.
[226:20.70]God damn it.
[226:27.34]It's snowing in Vermont right now?
[226:28.48]Are you serious?
[226:32.13]It's time for snow.
[226:35.69]Roadhog Baskin reveal at BlizzCon.
[226:38.23]Didn't they already do that?
[226:41.41]Isn't there already a... Oh.
[226:45.25]Wait, isn't Roadhog already, like, technically a...
[226:52.60]It's time.
[226:53.04]No more nonsense.
[226:53.92]I'm just going over the... Hold on.
[226:58.09]I want to get a good look.
[227:00.81]I need a spot where I can look.
[227:05.45]I can't see.
[227:05.87]I've got to go.
[227:07.59]Can't see from over there.
[227:13.31]Quit dying, dad.
[227:15.85]Spoonerism?
[227:16.57]That's spoonerism?
[227:17.71]Spoonerism.
[227:18.25]How the hell are you, dude?
[227:20.06]Let me see you again.
[227:26.04]Question, though, is... God, will you please stop, you morons?
[227:33.11]That's right.
[227:33.53]I swear to God.
[227:35.61]You stupid depressed chickens.
[227:38.85]With your R1 spam.
[227:49.18]I'm gonna go back around again.
[227:50.20]I'm pretty good.
[227:53.40]How's life?
[227:53.94]How's life treating you?
[227:56.48]Let me get these souls.
[227:58.02]I don't want to lose that many right now.
[228:01.40]Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
[228:04.90]Actually, it's good that I baited that guy down here.
[228:09.12]Because... Wait, what?
[228:12.89]Hold on a second.
[228:13.47]My brain hurts right now.
[228:15.53]My whole body hurts.
[228:17.81]Is that... Is that door closed?
[228:24.21]That's not the door.
[228:24.91]It's this door, right?
[228:27.53]Okay, my entire body just hurt.
[228:34.03]So I can open that one.
[228:36.60]The question is do I even need to?
[228:49.90]Just eating these dumb depressed chicken spells.
[228:55.01]Ah, I was just gonna shoot this random shit on you.
[228:58.81]Oh no.
[228:59.64]Let's get over here and take a look.
[229:04.30]I'm gonna clear it this time.
[229:06.98]Clear, clear, clear, clear, clear.
[229:08.82]If they're gonna keep doing it, then get rid of them.
[229:12.15]Time to clean the sprites.
[229:13.33]I mean, can I even?
[229:16.17]Yeah.
[229:31.18]Alright, two more down here.
[229:32.66]Hello.
[229:35.11]I need a spot to take a good look.
[229:46.27]So I need to go over there.
[229:49.30]Now, if I were a smart boy...
[230:03.42]If I were a smart boy, I would go in here.
[230:07.46]Right?
[230:14.84]Holy shit.
[230:17.26]That is not a room that I want to ever be in.
[230:21.85]New outfit.
[230:23.37]Cool.
[230:26.53]That didn't really do anything for me, though.
[230:31.61]I kind of like it.
[230:33.48]Sure.
[230:37.08]Alright, you got it.
[230:37.76]Let's put the whole thing on.
[230:39.98]Is it called Slave Knight?
[230:43.04]Put these on too.
[230:52.53]Were there pants?
[230:54.19]Yeah.
[231:02.33]They kind of suck.
[231:02.91]These are better.
[231:10.43]This is what a little kid does when they want to be a superhero.
[231:12.98]They go get a towel from their parents' bathroom.
[231:16.18]And wrap it around like this.
[231:19.68]I'm a super villain.
[231:29.23]That opened that door.
[231:36.38]He's doing a red riding hood.
[231:39.20]It's like a legit bathroom towel.
[231:48.12]I gotta go up and across the bridge.
[231:49.90]So let's go with that.
[231:50.97]Do that now.
[232:00.49]This way.
[232:02.91]Hello.
[232:04.87]Little green red riding hood.
[232:09.48]Alright.
[232:12.64]And I go up.
[232:13.84]I should be able to go across.
[232:15.90]And I can see where the hell I need to go.
[232:26.07]That way.
[232:29.29]Last time I was up here, I went this way, but I want to go this way now.
[232:33.35]Okie dokie.
[232:35.19]The path forward has found.
[232:37.00]It's been found.
[232:39.46]Made it across.
[232:41.84]Not yet, but, you know, I will eventually here.
[232:43.98]Now that I know you have to come up this way.
[232:45.18]I think I hear a scarecrow.
[232:47.26]I'll top myself off.
[232:53.51]I'm not sure where to go first.
[233:01.31]Thought that was me dying.
[233:06.71]Very well could have been.
[233:14.47]Looks like we're going this way.
[233:18.35]Nothing here.
[233:24.85]On a scale from depressed chicken to optimistic frogman, how much are you enjoying the DLC?
[233:30.97]So far, so good.
[233:34.05]I like the areas.
[233:35.93]Like the snow.
[233:38.43]To an extent.
[233:39.89]Okay, gotta be careful here.
[233:40.95]Let me open this.
[233:43.63]So I don't have to do this again.
[233:44.45]So I can run straight through.
[233:51.89]Don't aggro the fucking sword muppet.
[233:55.44]That would be bad.
[233:56.22]Oh dear.
[234:14.30]Well... There's nothing I can do there, besides die to claw muppet.
[234:22.85]Okie dokie, this room's gonna be hell.
[234:32.20]This room is going to be hell.
[234:34.78]Good thing I opened those two gates.
[234:37.91]This would not have been fun.
[234:45.59]I didn't realize I'm going to aggro this other Muppet over here.
[234:49.70]That was such overkill, man.
[234:50.74]You could have killed that guy with one slash.
[235:01.08]Hope he's too stupid to come in here.
[235:02.24]Alright, what is the item that's over here?
[235:08.74]Let me just get it.
[235:10.00]Way... I don't even know what it was.
[235:11.25]Anything else in here?
[235:13.77]Anything, anything, anything?
[235:15.09]Anything important?
[235:16.67]If there's nothing important in this room, then I'm gonna go.
[235:18.99]I don't think so.
[235:22.99]I got what I needed.
[235:24.40]Goodbye.
[235:24.72]Can I close the door?
[235:27.92]That wasn't even the opening of the door!
[235:31.79]Wasn't even the right opening Man just get me in here Wait no, what's over here?
[235:45.91]Still being chased not really She's not gonna yes, she is of course she is Of course she is
[236:01.93]Why wouldn't she?
[236:08.18]Cheese it?
[236:10.88]Not yet.
[236:11.22]If I have to keep going in that room, I will.
[236:16.08]No cheese.
[236:16.82]Not right now.
[236:17.54]What the hell is... What's the... Papa Sif, whatever area?
[236:31.16]He's still here.
[236:38.05]That almost instantly killed me.
[236:39.69]Holy crap.
[236:42.19]These gravestones are really good.
[237:01.97]I'm gonna use these things to my advantage.
[237:24.12]Well fought!
[237:26.06]Well fought!
[237:28.36]It's almost like he did that on purpose.
[237:33.56]Thanks a lot, Linker.
[237:36.62]You're welcome.
[237:37.00]No, we don't have to fight this dumb guy.
[237:39.10]Wasn't this an NPC that was a good guy?
[238:01.14]Okay, he has Inuyasha's sword.
[238:02.48]What's it called?
[238:02.90]The Inuyasha blade.
[238:04.58]What's it called?
[238:08.18]Wind Scar?
[238:09.71]I saw that show on Adult Swim like three times.
[238:11.45]What the hell is that move?
[238:33.56]That was a mistake.
[238:41.06]Oh wow, get discovered.
[238:46.54]Don't, no!
[238:59.45]Oh, you are such a piece of shit.
[239:07.24]I'm never going to tell you that.
[239:14.59]He's going to do it again.
[239:16.89]No, he's not.
[239:20.53]He's dead.
[239:21.95]Contraption key in the Onyx Blade.
[239:26.57]Nice new wrecked meme.
[239:32.17]Thanks a lot.
[239:32.75]Nothinglessness.
[239:34.09]Thanks a lot, Nothinglessness.
[239:35.38]Welcome.
[239:37.57]Let's take a look at that thing.
[239:40.10]Onyx Blade.
[239:40.70]What the hell is it?
[239:53.32]Oh, I couldn't use it.
[239:55.04]It's like a faith weapon.
[239:56.72]Magic weapon.
[239:57.36]Dark magic.
[239:58.17]Wow.
[240:02.75]Dark magic.
[240:04.31]Cool.
[240:04.77]This guy's cool.
[240:07.35]Forgive me, my lady.
[240:09.13]Yeah.
[240:11.79]It always seems to cover the most opportune times, doesn't it?
[240:16.15]I have a lot of souls, too.
[240:18.23]Let's be very careful in this next room.
[240:19.99]So many books.
[240:23.39]This place is so dark.
[240:28.81]Something is lurking in these shadows.
[240:36.00]There's definitely a sleeping guy over here.
[240:40.47]He's going in.
[240:40.89]See if we find him.
[240:42.93]Anybody?
[240:44.01]No.
[240:50.03]Making sure I don't miss anything.
[240:53.27]Alright, let's put the contraption in.
[240:54.67]And see what we end up with.
[241:04.46]I would have laughed so hard if that just hit me right in the face.
[241:13.58]Nothing behind.
[241:14.51]Oh, that's the lady.
[241:25.55]Why are you trying to get me killed?
[241:30.12]I feel the scent of ash upon thee.
[241:33.09]Thou art the one of whom Uncle Gael spoke.
[241:37.01]The one to show me flame.
[241:40.81]Tis good.
[241:42.55]When this is done, may I return.
[241:45.43]The door is open thanks to thee.
[241:48.61]Why is my character Shrek green?
[241:50.18]I don't know.
[241:52.54]Tis good.
[241:53.14]I'll head off to paint.
[241:56.34]I promised Uncle Gael I would.
[241:58.00]It's a different lady.
[242:01.24]Okay.
[242:04.88]Well.
[242:06.78]Secret ahead.
[242:09.12]Very cool.
[242:10.70]Let me pull this just in case this is some kind of skip.
[242:15.14]What?
[242:18.57]This is like an elevator.
[242:22.11]I'm not going down there.
[242:22.91]Ooh.
[242:26.21]Ooh.
[242:28.51]Ah, you, I just, come on.
[242:31.67]Doesn't open from this side.
[242:32.85]Oh, that really stinks.
[242:41.19]Oh.
[242:43.01]Okay.
[242:44.07]Well, that was easy enough.
[242:45.98]Hey, Sachery.
[242:52.44]Thanks for the sub.
[242:52.92]You're welcome.
[242:59.30]I got a feeling I'm fairly close to boss number two in the DLC.
[243:10.22]Oh man, that stinks.
[243:17.31]Anything else I can do here or should I just keep going that way?
[243:20.63]Looks like I just can keep going this way.
[243:27.91]New place to go.
[243:31.15]Goodbye.
[243:31.53]I'm gonna try left first.
[243:40.56]Just take a peek.
[243:51.01]Yeah, we're gonna go left first.
[243:56.17]Seems pretty open.
[244:04.20]Raining fire bombs down here.
[244:05.62]Prism stones.
[244:07.58]Who cares?
[244:09.36]Pretty useless.
[244:12.48]They don't just hit each other with their own shit.
[244:24.99]That was kind of funny.
[244:26.65]Nothing even down here.
[244:29.69]What was the point of this?
[244:31.57]There was none.
[244:40.20]Got him.
[244:42.98]I'll take the grand gold medal prize for that one.
[244:46.19]Wrap around some more.
[245:01.46]Don't ask me why I thought I could... Don't be so greedy.
[245:06.02]Don't be so greedy.
[245:16.52]Up or down?
[245:20.30]Up.
[245:25.66]I would have been so mad if he had actually hit me and connected with one of those.
[245:38.79]Still alive.
[245:46.55]Alright, the Ben Franklin bell in the middle.
[245:48.04]I'm going to remember where that is so I don't lose myself here because I could probably get pretty damn lost here.
[245:54.34]Are you serious?
[245:58.76]Follower shield.
[246:04.34]I'm going to throw the spear at you in 20 seconds.
[246:10.63]Just you wait.
[246:14.73]It's very loud.
[246:18.65]Every time, it just screams in my ear.
[246:34.21]I like this weapon.
[246:35.63]I like it better than the katana.
[246:37.99]Very much so.
[246:47.84]Caught in that corner.
[246:51.03]Oh, would you please.
[247:01.06]Would you kindly.
[247:10.58]Pretty much clearing this whole area.
[247:22.55]Alright, Ben Franklin belt.
[247:29.95]Anything I can do?
[247:30.49]Can I ring it?
[247:32.17]No.
[247:32.23]I'm gonna go up.
[247:47.91]So many of these guys.
[247:49.21]I hope I find something that'll take a shortcut or something.
[247:51.18]I really do.
[247:52.94]There are so many of these guys here.
[247:55.11]Let's go over this way first.
[248:01.75]No stealth ahead.
[248:02.89]What the hell does that mean?
[248:05.61]More wolves.
[248:07.56]The bane of my whole existence in this game.
[248:14.14]Don't start throwing these at me again.
[248:19.27]Please don't just start spamming wolves at me like you did in the beginning.
[248:25.18]Aye, aye, aye, I hear one.
[248:31.02]Shard.
[248:38.74]Go down there.
[248:44.43]Ambush ahead.
[248:48.77]Really now?
[248:50.87]Thanks for the tip.
[248:57.06]Crap.
[249:00.08]This is where we run.
[249:01.66]I gotta get on better ground.
[249:05.24]Big Viking up there.
[249:06.00]I'm just scaling this mountain.
[249:09.89]I have no idea where this is leading me.
[249:12.11]Shit.
[249:14.11]Oh boy.
[249:17.55]Any more wolves?
[249:26.96]I look so scared cowering behind this rock.
[249:31.08]Where is he?
[249:31.56]I can hear him.
[249:34.64]He's smashing his head against a rock.
[249:37.80]Over and over again.
[249:40.72]He's trying to see how long until he passes out.
[249:46.21]I thought he just... I thought he died.
[249:47.51]Bang, bang, bang.
[250:10.97]I did it one too many times.
[250:12.21]I thought I could... Fuck me.
[250:15.52]It's going to be a pain in the absolute dick to get back up there.
[250:27.50]What a, this is horrible.
[250:29.59]What a pain in the absolute groin.
[250:33.75]There's probably 25 of these guys.
[250:35.97]And then like 10 wolves and then a huge guy.
[250:39.05]I just gotta get my souls.
[250:40.17]He's running.
[250:41.32]Fuck it.
[250:43.14]He's up this way, right?
[250:44.00]Past Ben Franklin's bell.
[250:45.66]And then upscaling them out.
[250:53.11]Forget it.
[250:53.55]I need to get my shit.
[251:17.29]Huh?
[251:21.21]Huh?
[251:27.24]It's... Where... Where am I?
[251:50.20]I don't know where I am now.
[251:56.46]Oh!
[252:03.15]I gotta go all the way around, don't I?
[252:08.43]Hopefully I can do something from around here.
[252:12.93]No, I'm screwed.
[252:15.43]Well, good to know.
[252:19.28]Wait.
[252:22.42]This brings me up.
[252:24.36]Where does this bring me?
[252:29.97]51,000.
[252:31.57]Don't lose them.
[252:33.93]Stop going on little adventures and go get your souls and just go that way.
[252:45.77]Where's the Ben Franklin bell?
[252:47.87]That's how I know where I am.
[252:48.73]Okay, there's the Ben Franklin bell.
[252:52.01]Saw it.
[252:53.19]This way.
[252:54.04]Right?
[252:55.28]I'm so turned around right now.
[252:57.44]God, I'm so turned on right now.
[253:03.86]I have to make myself giggle, otherwise I'm going to be very upset.
[253:12.98]Move.
[253:13.80]Move it or lose it, sister.
[253:15.80]Move it or lose it.
[253:21.28]Move it or lose it, my friend.
[253:22.32]I don't remember these guys.
[253:25.08]Did I go the wrong way?
[253:27.98]Was it two of them?
[253:28.64]No, this way.
[253:42.11]Got him!
[253:45.55]I'll come back in like a couple of years to find you again.
[253:48.33]Here comes the big guy with bow.
[253:59.92]Good, he's too dumb.
[254:05.02]But easy, because if I get... somebody comes up behind me, these guys are too...
[254:15.73]Alright, I'm gonna have to use some football tactics here.
[254:18.11]I'm gonna have to be the running back, the wide receiver.
[254:21.34]Alright, here we go.
[254:22.92]Football tactic.
[254:28.86]Got the football on that one.
[254:36.06]What is this?
[254:37.01]Mine.
[254:41.65]What's this?
[254:42.77]What is this?
[254:43.25]Destroy.
[254:50.32]Okay, it's a log.
[254:53.38]I got a log.
[254:54.94]Log shortcut.
[254:57.22]Now where?
[254:59.68]Where does this lead to?
[255:13.39]Okay, so that I can run straight up there.
[255:18.27]No, I can't.
[255:20.64]Here we go.
[255:20.94]Here's another one.
[255:25.76]Where on Earth is this going to take me?
[255:31.36]Okay.
[255:39.26]Shortcut.
[255:40.98]There's the shortcut.
[255:44.20]I found it.
[255:47.16]Hello.
[255:47.42]Goodbye.
[255:55.74]Let's go back to the shrine.
[255:56.96]I don't think I can spend these souls.
[256:05.61]Almost puked my pants.
[256:08.05]Almost.
[256:10.73]Where is lady?
[256:11.47]There you go.
[256:13.44]Ashen one for the Lord Ling.
[256:16.00]Very well.
[256:16.40]Then he...
[256:17.98]I can level up once.
[256:18.68]Let me put an endurance.
[256:23.04]What's my vitality?
[256:24.14]No, my vigor.
[256:26.63]Vigor or... I'm going to say endurance.
[256:37.07]Yeah.
[256:39.01]Or...
[256:43.90]This is probably going to be the last point I put in before I beat the DLC.
[256:48.19]I would assume.
[256:50.91]Put into luck.
[256:57.09]Endurance.
[257:01.44]Who gives a shit?
[257:02.22]Let's buy.
[257:03.52]Oh, I remember this guy.
[257:05.24]I know you.
[257:07.24]Been some time.
[257:11.15]Shut up.
[257:25.30]Get me back.
[257:27.24]Upgrade those claws.
[257:28.18]Nah, I'm gonna stick with this weapon.
[257:30.58]This thing's plus 10.
[257:31.58]I just made it plus 10.
[257:35.24]Look at his intelligence.
[257:36.18]What a dumbass.
[257:44.21]What was the name of that place?
[257:46.85]Was it the settlement?
[257:50.27]I think so.
[257:58.19]The cesspool.
[257:59.39]This is not the right one, is it?
[258:10.56]No, it's not.
[258:13.75]What the hell was it called?
[258:14.45]Mountain Pass?
[258:15.03]I don't even remember what the hell the place is called.
[258:26.87]We'll find it sooner or later.
[258:31.02]You killed that guy right away.
[258:39.78]Let's go back to where we were and see where that leads.
[258:54.43]Hey, look, a tree.
[258:56.27]I could probably go across this.
[258:59.32]Almost walked off.
[259:01.14]Was pretty close.
[259:09.30]Shouldn't be watching this because of spoilers.
[259:13.25]Yeah, it's up to you.
[259:13.87]If you want to stick around, you can.
[259:17.13]You're not obligated to stick around.
[259:20.07]Appreciate you hanging around nonetheless.
[259:24.29]Here's the second one.
[259:25.29]Alright, I'm assuming I have to walk in this cave.
[259:26.81]This cave looks like it's important.
[259:35.34]Try torch.
[259:36.78]Try torch.
[259:37.46]Okay, sure.
[259:42.94]Bugs?
[259:46.81]Bugs?
[259:55.51]You guys suck.
[259:57.57]You guys are lame.
[259:58.41]Terrible enemy.
[259:58.99]It would be cool if they were scary, but they're not even scary either.
[260:04.56]They're just bugs.
[260:07.44]They're just annoying cartoon flies.
[260:17.21]Come on.
[260:17.53]No, that's the problem with these bugs.
[260:21.11]They make you have blood loss.
[260:23.39]Secret passage, is that what he's looking at?
[260:24.99]Hey.
[260:27.63]Look at that.
[260:29.35]Oh, that scared the shit out of me.
[260:33.67]Where am I?
[260:35.45]The bugs are gone.
[260:37.54]Well, where did that even take me?
[260:44.60]I'm so confused right now.
[260:54.39]Is it another room with these dumb things?
[261:04.47]So many of these bugs.
[261:19.65]Oh no.
[261:21.26]He's sucking my brain out.
[261:22.50]I don't think I even have a torch.
[261:31.60]Probably should just go buy one if I'm gonna be here.
[261:33.20]He did it again.
[261:42.06]One thing they didn't fuck around with in this DLC is enemy density.
[261:44.92]That is for sure.
[261:50.38]Seems like there are way more jam-packed in enemies in this DLC than the whole game.
[261:55.43]Maybe the first area.
[261:56.37]There's a lot of enemies in the first area.
[261:59.95]I gotta be careful here.
[262:00.73]I'm gonna kinda die.
[262:02.75]No, I'm done with these guys.
[262:04.89]We're done here.
[262:07.65]Just run around in a circle, get the items, and just get the fuck out of here.
[262:12.05]He's giving me a headache.
[262:20.35]Blood gem.
[262:21.11]There's something in the corner too.
[262:27.13]Okay.
[262:30.24]Another set.
[262:32.40]I'm gonna die.
[262:33.88]I'm gonna bleed out.
[262:36.86]They're swarming me.
[262:38.84]I'm getting swarmed.
[262:42.84]Anything else?
[262:45.08]If you'd like to show me down here, this is the end.
[262:49.14]I'm gonna bleed out again.
[262:50.74]See ya.
[262:51.16]I don't think there's anything else down here.
[262:56.35]9 out of 10 chatters agree.
[263:07.27]You don't want to just get the items and leave.
[263:09.07]No, I gotta get a torch is what I need.
[263:11.96]Do I have one?
[263:14.69]No.
[263:15.17]I'll go buy one.
[263:16.93]With the souls that I don't have.
[263:24.84]Does she sell a torch?
[263:25.88]Does anybody sell a torch or do I have no option here?
[263:37.85]She sells it or he sells it.
[263:38.95]Let's see.
[263:43.49]Hey, a torch.
[263:44.01]300 souls.
[263:46.03]I would love it if you could shut up, lady.
[263:56.57]200?
[263:56.59]Oh, that's not cool.
[264:09.44]Torch purchased.
[264:19.37]I'm not going to be using the shield down here anyways.
[264:27.25]I need to go buy a stick and set somebody on fire.
[264:40.12]I'm going to try.
[264:48.86]I'm gonna try.
[264:54.26]Boys!
[264:56.04]Oh, wait a minute.
[265:00.52]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[265:02.75]No, I had it.
[265:03.25]I don't know why the hell I'm thinking I don't have this thing.
[265:14.27]You know, let's go ahead and reset this.
[265:18.83]Press the reset button on the Nintendo.
[265:21.92]Please reset the Nintendo.
[265:25.96]Alright.
[265:26.38]Good.
[265:27.26]Thank you.
[265:35.87]Wait a minute, am I even going the right way?
[265:42.16]My brain is just fried right now.
[265:44.98]Wasn't it really close to the edge here?
[265:47.12]Oh, the fucking skip, skip, the fucking elevator.
[265:53.74]I told you, my brain is just fried.
[266:04.63]I was like, for some reason, I'm just sitting there going, I just walked off.
[266:12.54]I'm just like, where am I going?
[266:14.04]I remember there being a log.
[266:31.06]Have you tried restarting your machine?
[266:33.78]Have you tried blowing into the cartridge?
[266:45.27]Camera just was really odd right there.
[266:51.01]In we go.
[266:57.76]Try the torch.
[267:00.61]Alright, I just want to go to the back of this room.
[267:04.71]See what else is in here.
[267:05.93]Before going down there again.
[267:12.45]Really?
[267:13.11]They just, like, hone in on you.
[267:26.78]God.
[267:28.67]These fuckers are so annoying.
[267:40.67]Seriously.
[267:41.80]When there's ten of you in a fucking room.
[267:44.14]Fucking Jason up the density it seems.
[267:52.91]Hey, you know like the rooms in Dark Souls?
[267:54.79]Why don't we put like fucking 30 bugs in it?
[267:58.14]They typically would be like 21 or like 15.
[268:01.30]Just throw fucking 100 in that room.
[268:05.84]Is that going to really piss off the person playing the game?
[268:07.88]Do it!
[268:09.00]Oh, by the way, in the door, go get the dung pile.
[268:10.58]But wait, we have fucking one spawn behind him.
[268:24.69]There's a door over here.
[268:26.47]Oh, that's the illusory one.
[268:27.53]Okay.
[268:27.83]What about over here?
[268:28.98]Hmm.
[268:43.06]Chains.
[268:46.16]A bug just standing in this room.
[268:49.58]I don't even need to be here.
[269:05.35]Think I found a place to go.
[269:11.65]Wasn't I looking at this door earlier?
[269:13.71]And I was saying that something's odd about this.
[269:19.70]Yeah.
[269:20.94]Well, there it is.
[269:26.02]There's that random door that made no sense.
[269:28.59]Here it is.
[269:29.37]Okay.
[269:30.81]Huh.
[269:33.30]Well, I can go to the cathedral now and just come right here.
[269:37.32]Skip number two.
[269:38.00]I guess we do have to go down there.
[269:52.32]What else is even down there, though?
[269:55.62]I don't know.
[270:01.41]We're going to find out.
[270:02.12]We're going to slowly make our way down there and stay down there.
[270:05.16]Is there another illusory wall?
[270:15.47]No.
[270:19.82]Okay.
[270:19.98]Okay.
[270:23.09]Easy does it.
[270:24.27]Let's clear this room, sort of, kind of, and figure out what else is even down here.
[270:28.66]There's the souls from before.
[270:31.18]Try to get less than a couple of them at a time.
[270:34.30]Oh my god, that move.
[270:40.82]That move is so stupid.
[270:43.26]It really is the dumbest fucking move ever.
[270:44.92]Because they just kind of fly in the air at you and...
[270:54.07]There's really nothing to even dodge with it.
[270:55.79]They just don't have an animation and fly at your face.
[270:58.61]See that nod?
[270:59.27]Look at that.
[271:00.93]Damn it.
[271:04.77]Stop.
[271:05.31]Stop complaining.
[271:06.81]You're doing the thing.
[271:07.81]You're doing the thing that I said that people do when they play this game.
[271:11.83]Fucking not even an animation.
[271:12.89]There's not even an animation on that guy.
[271:14.75]There wasn't even an animation.
[271:16.95]What am I talking about?
[271:17.77]Of course there was.
[271:19.85]Of course there was an animation.
[271:23.56]I'm self-justifying again.
[271:30.40]But really, though, I hate these enemies.
[271:31.95]They're stupid.
[271:33.55]Game sucks.
[271:39.81]Can we make a Jerma soundboard?
[271:42.28]If you want.
[271:42.80]I don't know what you'd do with it, though.
[272:08.15]There it is.
[272:08.63]I didn't get hit by it this time.
[272:12.29]Probably will get hit by it next time.
[272:13.57]Because I suck.
[272:29.48]You know, I always see that as a...
[272:32.88]Not as a grab, but as a traveling move.
[272:34.68]That's why it's been hitting me all the time.
[272:36.98]I just keep thinking it's a... Hey, I'm coming to fly to get you, not grab your face.
[272:49.21]I really hope there was a reason to come down here.
[272:50.91]Otherwise, I'm going to feel real stupid.
[272:57.11]Found the reason to come down here.
[273:07.69]I hear a noise.
[273:28.87]Was this a door the whole time?
[273:30.13]Why don't I just play Animal Crossing?
[273:40.02]A bunch of people missed that thing down there, the wheel.
[273:49.88]Well, I think I found the next place to go.
[274:08.21]Alright, is he gonna teleport me there?
[274:09.43]Teleport me.
[274:15.84]Back to the cathedral, boys and girls.
[274:18.92]But first... Is there anything else down here?
[274:24.48]Before I leave.
[274:43.74]This looks suspicious.
[274:45.20]No.
[274:51.35]This is so suspicious.
[274:52.99]Yeah, are you kidding me?
[274:56.35]Cookie, cookie, cookie!
[274:58.39]Give me the cookie!
[275:02.74]Yes.
[275:07.80]Am I too late?
[275:08.36]Did he already get the cookie?
[275:13.08]That was mine!
[275:27.68]Hey, thanks, Cassius.
[275:31.66]Cassiusus.
[275:33.02]Appreciate it.
[275:33.70]Welcome.
[275:36.34]Alright, back to the cathedral.
[275:44.22]Pretty sure there's nothing else I can do here.
[275:45.68]Wait, make sure I didn't miss something.
[275:51.29]You know, actually, somebody said this.
[275:54.07]I've seen this a couple times.
[275:55.23]That there's like a tiny sound delay here.
[276:00.02]I'm going to do a test with you guys.
[276:01.72]You ready?
[276:01.96]Okay.
[276:03.36]I'm going to swing the sword.
[276:04.76]What the hell was that?
[276:06.48]My game is completely freaking out right now.
[276:08.96]When I look at the tiles.
[276:10.80]Okay, well.
[276:12.74]I'm going to say when I swing the sword.
[276:15.22]I'm going to say, swing!
[276:16.60]And tell me if it happens at the exact same time.
[276:18.64]Ready?
[276:19.80]Swing!
[276:22.22]Swing!
[276:23.44]So when you see the white arc, that's when I'm going to say it.
[276:26.45]Swing!
[276:27.61]Swing!
[276:28.99]Swing!
[276:31.47]Is there a sound delay on the stream right now?
[276:40.12]Because I'd have to go into OBS and make an offset.
[276:42.48]Remember, when you see the white... Not really.
[276:56.97]Like a half... Really?
[276:57.99]Like a small one?
[276:59.65]Don't see one.
[277:00.19]It's less than a half second.
[277:03.26]I still haven't seen the swing yet.
[277:04.72]Jesus.
[277:05.98]Jesus.
[277:14.14]It's like 100 milliseconds.
[277:15.16]0.2 seconds.
[277:17.12]Well, I'm going to do an offset on my voice then and make it like a 50 or 100 millisecond delay.
[277:32.63]Alright, I don't think there's anything else in here.
[277:33.89]I'm just going to go.
[277:35.53]Bye, bugs.
[277:39.99]It was nice to know you.
[277:42.61]I think I can take the torch off now.
[277:44.83]Although I don't mind the extra light.
[277:56.58]Pointless.
[277:58.72]Pointless, but beautiful.
[278:00.14]I just think it's time to do a homeward bone here.
[278:18.31]I'm at the part where it says he's starting soon.
[278:20.41]Am I far behind?
[278:21.71]Yeah, I'd say you're pretty far behind.
[278:26.81]Let's go see what happened.
[278:40.71]Nice Google Chrome Shield?
[278:42.39]What?
[278:56.74]Yeah, you know, it's a good one.
[278:58.62]That was a good one.
[279:00.48]Google Chrome.
[279:02.10]Why?
[279:02.46]Like, where did it come from?
[279:04.46]How'd you come up with that?
[279:05.40]I'm at the point where he burnt down the city of Thebes and Flanker was there.
[279:10.57]Am I too far behind?
[279:11.51]Yeah, you're about, like, two weeks stream delay.
[279:27.83]I think I found the boss.
[279:34.46]This is definitely the boss.
[279:38.24]This guy's a little goofy.
[279:51.29]Alright, this thing's going to step aside and there's going to be a little dwarf behind him.
[279:57.93]Swagmaster, thanks for the sub, and let's kill this boss.
[280:05.43]Hello.
[280:14.78]My filial?
[280:16.36]Bring me my filial.
[280:23.46]Bring Friede to me, please.
[280:31.57]This is the wizard.
[280:35.01]We found the wizard, guys.
[280:37.13]Maybe I'll get a badge of courage.
[280:40.99]Alright.
[280:46.67]I'm going to put on my pants and get really mad for the next 45 straight minutes while I lose 12 times in a row.
[280:58.76]If this shit is a double boss again, I'm gonna be so mad.
[281:05.97]Don't do another double boss now.
[281:07.41]Please don't do it.
[281:08.05]Double fucking boss.
[281:10.69]Is there all along?
[281:18.80]It's not a double boss, please.
[281:27.60]It's not.
[281:28.34]Okay.
[281:28.86]No, it will be.
[281:29.92]Of course it will be.
[281:31.44]I'm gonna take her down to like 30% health and he's gonna stand up and start fighting me.
[281:35.68]Unbelievable.
[281:37.33]I already know what's gonna happen.
[281:39.27]And I'm not happy about it.
[281:46.87]That's a long cast move.
[281:49.81]That's so long.
[281:50.49]I don't even know when she's gonna do it.
[281:53.90]Alright, when's he gonna stand up?
[281:55.72]When's he gonna stand up?
[282:07.29]Really?
[282:07.55]That was a backstab.
[282:08.63]And everybody's... Oh, she's invisible now.
[282:10.81]Not good.
[282:20.83]See ya.
[282:22.11]Time to fight the real boss.
[282:24.97]How did you have fun fighting this first boss?
[282:28.41]Well, the real one's about to stand up.
[282:37.92]You got me.
[282:39.64]You dirty trickster.
[282:42.06]Alright, here we go.
[282:59.52]After she gets out of the invisibility...
[283:03.27]Oh, my flail.
[283:05.11]Oh, my flail.
[283:06.09]Good job, daughter.
[283:09.25]Good work.
[283:11.77]Did you fight my flail?
[283:15.38]Oh, you did it.
[283:16.22]Now bring me my flail so I can fight him now.
[283:18.62]I'm dead.
[283:25.45]You son of a bitch.
[283:30.56]I can smell the blood of the sinner, my daughter!
[283:49.62]You didn't do that!
[283:56.13]Ay caramba!
[283:59.09]I'm ruining this, I'm so sorry.
[284:04.13]See, I told you.
[284:04.97]Oh my god.
[284:08.14]This guy's fucked.
[284:13.16]Oh shit.
[284:21.88]I like actually getting scared right now.
[284:26.31]Oh, jeez.
[284:28.99]Now, let's be really clear about this.
[284:32.05]Cool, yeah, you kill her and she dies and you have to fight the boss, the real boss.
[284:36.98]I hope I don't have to do that again and again and again and again and again.
[284:41.14]That was my complaint with the last one.
[284:43.58]If I die and I have to come back here and do this again, I'm going to be so...
[284:48.92]It's just... Let me just get to the boss now.
[284:52.11]I saw the cutscene.
[284:53.79]Saw this shit.
[284:54.59]She lights on fire.
[284:55.47]And now I fight two people at the same fucking time.
[284:57.47]Because that's what this DLC is.
[284:58.79]Fight two bosses together at the same time.
[285:05.06]God damn it.
[285:09.10]God damn it.
[285:12.02]Of course.
[285:12.44]Why?
[285:13.82]Why?
[285:23.52]Where's my Luigi?
[285:26.46]You know what I mean?
[285:27.08]How come I don't get a Luigi?
[285:31.66]Everybody else in this DLC gets a fucking Luigi but me.
[285:36.35]Great.
[285:43.43]Man, I'm just burning.
[285:52.93]Oh, this chair is still... How did I find that cell button?
[286:01.74]He's still in the chair.
[286:03.36]What the hell are you doing?
[286:18.30]I can't even fight this guy.
[286:32.72]Don't come at me.
[286:39.82]Oh boy, ice and fire.
[286:44.49]A song of ice and fire.
[286:45.75]That hurt way too much.
[286:53.09]Dude, will you calm down?
[287:04.79]I need more!
[287:07.53]More!
[287:08.01]If I had any more potions, I might be able to... Son of a bitch, don't do it.
[287:20.23]He's breaking from the goblin.
[287:28.95]Here he comes, here he comes again.
[287:29.81]Now she, he, she, ha, she.
[287:32.04]He backs off.
[287:33.04]Now she come.
[287:34.04]Shut up.
[287:41.82]Huh?
[287:50.99]I win.
[287:51.87]I won.
[287:53.61]I win.
[287:57.34]I don't care.
[287:57.72]I beat him first try.
[287:58.76]Don't care.
[287:59.08]I'm done.
[287:59.84]I win.
[288:00.48]I beat the DLC.
[288:01.72]Fun game.
[288:03.49]That was a fun game.
[288:06.31]Dark Souls 3 DLC.
[288:07.29]Fun game.
[288:08.45]I give it a solid B. And it's good.
[288:15.76]Alright.
[288:16.02]Cool.
[288:16.74]Thanks for coming, everybody.
[288:18.52]Thanks for coming to the stream.
[288:20.50]We just beat it.
[288:21.56]Yeah.
[288:22.24]First try.
[288:23.70]Not a big deal.
[288:24.80]Yeah.
[288:28.25]Everyone dies.
[288:28.81]Yeah, we all die.
[288:42.85]No.
[288:43.94]I don't want to do this again.
[288:45.02]I don't want to do the whole thing again.
[288:47.02]I won.
[288:47.84]You all saw it.
[288:50.64]I beat them.
[288:51.70]I beat the DLC.
[288:52.68]Congratulations.
[288:53.60]Thanks for playing Dark Souls.
[288:58.95]Wait, let me put on... I got so greedy there, and it was the death of me.
[289:09.24]Let's get this off, get this off, put on... What do I have here?
[289:13.70]Gold pine.
[289:15.64]Rotten pine.
[289:18.78]Magic.
[289:19.20]Well, they both fire.
[289:28.81]Whatever.
[289:31.94]Dark.
[289:32.24]Let's just put on dark magic.
[289:33.50]Whatever.
[289:33.80]I'm so annoyed.
[289:36.00]Can't believe it.
[289:36.64]Get back in there, you big baby.
[289:41.30]I'm doing these loud pig screams lately.
[289:43.55]I don't know why.
[289:45.31]But thank you, Squidbones.
[289:46.41]Thank you, Rayburn, for the ten bucks.
[289:48.41]Appreciate it, dude.
[289:49.23]And hey, you guys like to fight this girl again?
[289:53.01]It's fun.
[289:55.04]I gotta shut the fuck up and beat her.
[289:58.24]Show her the true meaning of discovering America.
[290:18.03]Do it.
[290:18.43]Will you do them?
[290:19.43]That's the longest cast in the whole game.
[290:28.97]She wouldn't do that.
[290:35.41]Where did she go?
[290:44.66]I actually had no idea.
[290:45.52]I got a little spooked.
[290:51.59]Can't get ready to put this on.
[290:52.67]Don't be such a little... Don't be such a little baby.
[291:09.40]I'm kicking my feet under the desk.
[291:11.44]Like a second grader.
[291:15.92]My hands are so- I gotta start over.
[291:17.46]My hands are- they're covered in water.
[291:19.24]I put the controller down.
[291:20.54]I ran my hands under the sink before I fought this boss.
[291:30.89]Honest to God.
[291:33.81]They're covered in sweat.
[291:37.17]This is my controller.
[291:38.11]It looks like I dipped it in the toilet.
[291:46.50]I'm gonna get, like, gamer gloves.
[291:57.17]Let it go.
[291:57.79]Thanks a lot, Weevu.
[292:01.58]Welcome, dude.
[292:03.86]Okay.
[292:04.92]I'm gonna pick up the green shit so I don't accidentally touch it during the next fight.
[292:19.34]It's a good opener.
[292:20.38]But I need to hang back.
[292:23.09]Really, I need Pine Resin too.
[292:25.81]Be nice.
[292:26.67]You gotta be shitting me.
[292:35.67]That was dog shit.
[292:36.37]I beat it already!
[292:47.34]I killed them both on the first try and now I'm so mad that I can't even beat the fucking default, not even final form lady.
[293:00.61]I've lost my cool completely.
[293:02.27]I did this, I killed them both on the first try.
[293:05.79]But I died too.
[293:07.01]That Dark Souls 3 logic is even if you, it doesn't matter, you didn't win.
[293:19.97]Jesus, that was... I thought it was a long swing.
[293:23.95]Alright, let's go.
[293:41.34]Easy, easy, easy.
[293:48.71]I was trying to dodge right through that shit.
[293:50.65]I'm having so much trouble now.
[293:51.73]Alright, put it on.
[293:57.19]Let's go.
[293:58.41]Got the pine resin on.
[294:00.25]Come at me.
[294:01.15]Let's do it.
[294:17.12]Shit, I thought I was out of the hitbox.
[294:25.55]Man, oh man.
[294:27.03]I'm getting so comboed right now.
[294:28.35]What the fuck?
[294:35.48]I just got completely screwed over.
[295:00.41]Mmm you.
[295:01.79]Don't you do it.
[295:15.16]Jesus.
[295:15.60]I haven't had any good opportunities here.
[295:24.78]Okay, hello.
[295:31.74]Hello!
[295:33.70]Let's get some stamina, please.
[295:48.45]Jesus!
[295:49.29]Grimity!
[295:50.15]Jiminy Cricket!
[296:01.36]I was trying to target her for a little bit.
[296:03.72]God, these two boss bullshits are literally waiting on my eyes and ears.
[296:08.08]I ran out of stamina!
[296:37.96]I can't believe I did the first try.
[296:44.35]And now I'm never gonna fucking do it again.
[296:55.82]We all died on the first try.
[296:57.60]If I just wasn't so fucking greedy.
[297:01.74]That dark pine resident didn't do shit, so I'm going to take it off and put on something else.
[297:10.99]Magic?
[297:11.29]I don't know.
[297:11.75]Whatever.
[297:18.65]Okay.
[297:39.52]Listen to the cool music.
[298:01.11]It's got a cool tune.
[298:05.33]Pick- I gotta-
[298:07.79]I wish there was an option I could check to say, like, I don't give a fuck about my souls, please delete them from the area.
[298:13.25]Because if I don't pick those up, they're just a huge problem, because I would accidentally touch them.
[298:27.74]Not this time!
[298:44.21]Stupid prick!
[298:50.75]I want nothing to do with you right now.
[298:52.19]I just want to fight the both of yous.
[298:56.57]Come on, show yourself!
[299:04.10]Put it on.
[299:05.14]Let's go.
[299:08.32]Before he even gets up, beat the shit out of her.
[299:15.16]Fuck your daughter.
[299:15.96]Oh my god, she's- I-
[299:33.51]I didn't even know that she was disappeared.
[299:34.70]I didn't know where the hell she was going.
[300:05.88]Come on, split up.
[300:09.08]Split up, you two.
[300:11.06]Here he comes.
[300:13.29]Oh, get in my bath.
[300:14.43]Get in my jacuzzi.
[300:16.49]Come on, I swear it's nice and warm for you.
[300:31.73]Frost Pit is shit.
[300:32.43]It's not good.
[300:34.79]I'm gonna go heal.
[300:53.81]Get this fucking idiot away from me.
[300:58.27]I'm dead.
[300:59.70]Oh god.
[301:00.76]I fucking did it already!
[301:34.62]No, okay, I gotta put this on.
[301:37.18]Fuck this.
[301:40.75]What did you throw at Burger Boy?
[301:41.99]It was a cake.
[301:44.67]What a shame.
[301:45.35]Summon the guy.
[301:45.93]No, no summoning!
[301:49.19]I have to beat the unfair expansion.
[301:52.62]Where the only boss- Like, really?
[301:54.30]What the fuck?
[301:55.36]What the fuck were they doing?
[301:57.82]Why did they have the whole expansion have two bosses per- Like, come on.
[302:00.32]Give me, like, one boss.
[302:01.38]For fucking once.
[302:04.02]But thank you Baked Flakes for the 1500.
[302:05.82]It was a cake.
[302:07.18]It's just... They really had like a hard-on for these stupid fucking Mario and Luigi encounters, didn't they?
[302:23.87]Oh no, God.
[302:27.19]I love how I play trivia with you and you get a hundred bucks if I win.
[302:32.13]Well, that's very generous of you, dude.
[302:35.01]Thank you, baked flakes.
[302:38.73]That's 10,000 bits from baked flakes.
[302:44.94]Too many bits.
[302:53.68]Thank you, premium pillow, too.
[302:54.94]But yeah, baked flakes, that's a lot of cash.
[302:58.55]Appreciate it, dude.
[302:59.91]Thank you.
[303:10.74]What do I put on here?
[303:18.99]Okay, I look like a moron, but it's okay.
[303:21.91]I take 20,000 souls if you get it wrong.
[303:29.48]Like, where's he?
[303:30.48]Where is this guy?
[303:32.50]It's Sigward.
[303:33.20]Where's my friend?
[303:34.20]I don't have any friends.
[303:44.99]I mean, I'm not good at cycling items at all.
[303:48.72]It's so bad.
[303:49.48]I mean, it's good to put this on, but cycling between it and eating it, it's... I'm going to get myself killed.
[304:03.10]Summon Otto.
[304:07.79]I want to get this off the bar.
[304:12.63]And what about buying... Oh, I'm going to go to the Firelink.
[304:19.81]I need, like, lightning or something.
[304:21.93]What can I even do?
[304:26.21]To the left of you, you can see the shining.
[304:27.51]Yeah, but I don't want to co-op the boss.
[304:28.99]I want to beat the boss by myself.
[304:29.87]Alright.
[304:38.21]What is good for this?
[304:43.64]Because I can do... I can buy fire.
[304:45.50]I can buy magic.
[304:48.46]Gold pine.
[304:49.18]Gold pine resin.
[304:52.97]Maybe I'll try gold pine.
[304:59.43]I'm going to get some gold pine.
[305:01.07]See if that helps a little bit.
[305:13.52]Buy three of them.
[305:21.34]What about green blossom?
[305:27.18]I have some, yeah.
[305:28.38]Put those on too.
[305:30.65]And gold pine.
[305:33.61]Okay, let's try it again.
[305:35.91]Fire.
[305:43.61]Oh, whatever.
[305:44.01]We'll give this another couple of tries.
[305:46.09]I'm gonna pee my pants too, so there's that.
[305:55.78]Ugh, chapels.
[306:06.57]This fight, I mean, isn't that retard.
[306:09.61]It's just when they do, when they fill the room with that, you know, the frost on the ground and the fire, the frost filling the whole ground is a huge problem.
[306:19.64]But hopefully I can start to avoid that now by eating this shit.
[306:36.57]How are ya?
[306:38.94]Invisible.
[307:06.49]You know, I actually really do have to pee, and it's kind of fucking up my whole game here.
[307:09.63]I need to pee so badly.
[307:10.59]It just creeped up on me.
[307:17.15]No, I don't get to pee until I beat her.
[307:38.90]Did I get it off?
[307:43.89]I don't think I did.
[307:51.81]I'm doing like every single thing.
[307:57.49]What the fuck am I doing?
[308:07.61]Who are you?
[308:09.79]Who, who, who, who?
[308:11.25]I don't even care if she heals him at this point.
[308:14.95]They're too close.
[308:32.87]They're too close together right now.
[309:03.66]Wow!
[309:03.94]The fucking World Series!
[309:09.18]Where'd she go?
[309:10.60]Where is she?
[309:10.96]She's gonna heal.
[309:11.32]Where is she?
[309:11.66]Where the fuck are you?
[309:16.52]Oh, she's gonna heal, okay.
[309:18.58]Where's she gonna heal?
[309:19.08]Where's she going?
[309:20.51]Where's she going?
[309:40.03]Greed!
[309:41.73]So greedy!
[309:42.65]Calm down!
[309:46.81]Greed!
[309:48.49]Dibbly!
[309:50.20]Greed!
[309:51.40]Greed is good!
[309:52.42]Greed is good!
[309:53.48]Greed is good!
[309:54.62]Greed is good!
[309:55.80]I win.
[309:56.04]I beat that first try, you saw it all.
[310:03.88]Huh?
[310:15.19]Fuck this stupid game.
[310:21.38]I don't like it Oh
[310:47.80]Where the fuck are you, lady?
[310:53.54]I just fucking ran into it.
[310:56.27]I have no idea what she does for moves.
[310:57.95]This sucks such asshole.
[311:04.09]I... Okay.
[311:06.21]I'm, uh...
[311:18.70]I'm uh... Oh my god.
[311:26.51]What a fucking joke.
[311:34.21]These three tiered bosses, like, come on.
[311:38.03]Nobody wants to do this again.
[311:40.89]Nobody wants to do this shit.
[311:44.44]You find me one person that wants to go through this three tier dog shit again.
[311:50.95]I don't think anybody would raise their hand.
[311:57.47]I ain't raising my hand.
[311:58.41]Because now I have to beat the two in a row again.
[312:13.34]I don't want to fight this right now.
[312:15.48]I don't want to fight this fucking lady in her single form and then fight her and her dad and then fight her again.
[312:22.56]I just don't want to.
[312:23.28]I can, but I just don't want to.
[312:25.88]I'm just charging up a full swing.
[312:44.89]Like, the last boss of the game has two phases.
[312:46.91]I get it, right?
[312:48.85]Sometimes you get the two-phase boss.
[312:51.43]But a three-phase boss is so punishing, because then you have to... I can't even explain how my discontent with this shit.
[313:06.98]There's got to be some stupid dumb strat where I can spam her down as fast as possible.
[313:20.04]Listen to me, daughter.
[313:28.91]Here comes the dad.
[313:32.09]You're not taking my daughter to the prom, no way.
[313:42.91]I gotta pee.
[313:44.07]I gotta pee so bad before I piss my pants.
[313:48.24]I'll be back in two seconds.
[313:50.35]I'll be back in a minute.
[314:29.14]Wait, what?
[315:35.17]I think I want to equalize.
[315:40.13]Who are the equalizers I'm bringing in?
[315:48.48]For the first time ever, I'm thinking we're going to co-op this boss.
[315:53.66]This boss is dumb.
[315:58.48]I'm going to give it like one more try.
[316:01.95]Before I delete my accounts.
[316:06.05]You wanna go?
[316:06.45]Let's go.
[316:06.85]Come on in.
[316:08.09]No, fuck this.
[316:08.59]I don't give a shit.
[316:11.91]Let's go.
[316:12.67]Let's get four people in here.
[316:18.68]Who else?
[316:19.08]Anybody else?
[316:20.58]Let's fill this lobby.
[316:22.76]I want, I want Luigi, Wario, I even want fucking Waluigi.
[316:27.58]Get Waluigi in here too.
[316:31.96]Are there any other Mario characters I haven't thought of?
[316:37.03]Where'd he go?
[316:39.97]We're bringing the whole Mario family to this.
[316:45.35]Because, fuck this.
[316:47.87]I ain't gonna wipe here for two or three more hours.
[316:50.09]Yeah, I would even bring Toad, too.
[316:57.59]What happened to the sign?
[317:00.21]No, I need to... Yeah, I need an ember.
[317:06.98]Alright, guys.
[317:08.48]You guys ready to bring the whole family in here?
[317:12.62]That guy had a swear name.
[317:13.60]Alright, you.
[317:18.40]And you.
[317:20.15]And you.
[317:22.11]How many can be in one game at one time?
[317:31.63]What's going on?
[317:32.13]There we go.
[317:36.30]Alright, which Mario brother is this?
[317:39.80]Alright, that... That's definitely Waluigi.
[317:43.77]Actually, no, no, that's Wario, because he's yellow.
[317:50.59]Dude, that's... I don't know who that is.
[317:52.29]That's Toad.
[317:53.37]Can we do any more?
[317:54.45]Or can you only have three?
[317:57.19]Are you ready, Super Mario Brothers, to go on an adventure?
[318:01.53]Use dried fingers for another phantom?
[318:02.73]I think I have those.
[318:03.55]I think I do.
[318:03.97]Let's see.
[318:05.82]Dried fingers.
[318:14.51]Rubbish.
[318:14.91]I don't think I have them.
[318:15.77]Can I buy them?
[318:17.27]These guys go away, though.
[318:20.37]White as boo.
[318:21.22]What the hell?
[318:24.58]No, this is... I'm Super Mario.
[318:27.44]That's Wario.
[318:28.38]That's Luigi.
[318:30.37]Are you guys ready to go get Bowser and fucking Princess Daisy?
[318:33.87]Because that's who's in this door.
[318:35.73]Then they combine to become... Princess Dowser.
[318:39.97]Let's go.
[318:42.11]We're gonna destroy this now.
[318:43.91]Fuck this stupid co-op DLC.
[318:48.59]If bosses get co-op, so do I, motherfucker.
[318:51.03]Let's go.
[318:56.57]Let's do it!
[318:57.65]Let's go, Super Mario Brothers!
[319:01.44]Luigi, Mario, and Waluigi!
[319:04.56]Take on this stupid fucking bitch!
[319:08.06]Oh, but she can't even do a move!
[319:09.66]What do you know?
[319:13.98]Why did I do that?
[319:14.72]I didn't even need to... Oh, be careful.
[319:16.50]Careful.
[319:17.60]This is so cheesy.
[319:20.86]This is fucking stupid.
[319:27.09]Alright, you ready?
[319:27.59]Here comes Bowser.
[319:29.40]Oh, we got another guy!
[319:30.34]We got another- There's like three more people in here!
[319:34.30]Let's go!
[319:36.52]I don't know who's who!
[319:37.82]I don't know who's who, I can't tell who's who right now.
[319:42.65]Where is everybody?
[319:46.57]Watch out, Luigi!
[319:47.53]Be careful!
[319:50.91]Luigi, be careful!
[319:52.75]You don't want to get killed!
[319:53.63]Oh, thank god!
[319:54.87]We've got Toad stuck in the fucking circle!
[319:59.37]All the while, Waluigi taking on... I haven't done anything.
[320:06.34]This is so dumb.
[320:08.00]I just want to die.
[320:11.12]Like, I might die because I just can't handle this.
[320:19.51]This is so stupid.
[320:21.15]This is so unfair.
[320:22.23]Why could there be four people in here?
[320:24.19]There should not be four people allowed in here.
[320:32.74]Yeah, this is a World of Warcraft dungeon.
[320:37.42]Okay guys, are you ready to co-opt the shit out of this girl?
[320:42.92]Are you guys ready?
[320:49.02]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[320:50.90]How did this guy even get in here?
[320:52.80]This guy doesn't have... Oh, I think that's an NPC.
[320:56.30]Alright, go, my minions.
[320:57.37]I'm playing Pikmin right now.
[320:59.71]The yellow Pikmin has lightning damage.
[321:01.13]I remember that.
[321:02.55]The white Pikmin... I don't know what the white Pikmin did, but probably something cool.
[321:09.96]Alright, good job, yellow Pikmin.
[321:11.72]And by the way, when you're done fighting her, can you please pick up one of those coins over there so I can get two more of you yellow Pikmins?
[321:21.78]I'm just watching.
[321:22.66]I just don't want to fucking die.
[321:27.39]What the hell was that?
[321:28.29]This guy's throwing lightning balls.
[321:33.33]Don't forget to pick up your assault.
[321:34.44]Oh yeah, I'll go do that.
[321:35.34]Where are they?
[321:36.00]Over here somewhere?
[321:37.22]Over here.
[321:39.50]Look at fucking Waluigi just wailing away.
[321:45.05]Nice.
[321:45.97]Good job, White Pikmin.
[321:47.67]Let me get in here and do a couple of damage moves.
[321:50.52]Okay.
[321:51.38]I did it.
[321:56.64]Fuck you.
[321:58.44]I'm getting way too cocky here.
[321:59.50]I gotta be careful.
[322:00.90]Let me get a back step.
[322:08.77]Get her.
[322:09.51]Get her.
[322:09.83]Don't let her do any moves.
[322:10.93]Spam right bumper.
[322:12.99]Let's send her to hell.
[322:15.13]Uh-oh.
[322:17.85]I think we lost.
[322:18.41]Did we lose somebody?
[322:19.47]Nope.
[322:19.83]It's okay.
[322:20.39]Toad is fine.
[322:20.89]About to lose Luigi.
[322:25.81]About to lose Mario, and then everybody loses.
[322:27.87]I gotta get the last hit.
[322:30.80]Let me get the last hit.
[322:32.68]Got her.
[322:34.84]Got her.
[322:44.42]It's so dumb.
[322:46.52]Nice job.
[322:47.76]Thanks a lot, Mario Brothers.
[322:49.46]We did it.
[323:07.45]I don't feel like I accomplished anything right there.
[323:11.82]I don't think I did very much.
[323:13.30]You know, these are Mike Pickman.
[323:14.44]I told them to go to a certain area, and they went and they did it.
[323:21.82]That was a thing.
[323:24.66]We did it.
[323:28.45]I had a good view.
[323:29.43]I'm sorry.
[323:29.91]I had a good view.
[323:35.45]Yeah, now I like... Now I'm like sad.
[323:40.38]If I had given that like five to ten more attempts, I probably could have done it.
[323:45.94]Now I just feel... I feel incomplete.
[323:51.01]Is that it?
[323:51.55]Did I win?
[323:52.07]Is that the whole DLC?
[323:55.71]Impossible.
[324:01.57]I think that's it, right?
[324:06.49]God.
[324:07.53]That made me laugh.
[324:11.45]I love it dude all the people that just came like over here like all the people that look at this check this out yeah everybody that just joined the stream right now ah tough tough boss hard took a lot to work you know I remember when she turns in the first phase second phase damn it tough when you kill the second phase the two bowser and princess fucking hard man that took a lot out of me to get that last phase though all the people that just joined the stream took a lot out of me I did it though DLC done
[324:45.75]That's not it?
[324:47.45]Is there anything else I can even do?
[324:53.50]Ladder?
[324:53.92]Upstairs?
[324:54.48]Where's there a ladder?
[324:55.58]What are you talking about?
[324:57.56]Oh, that's right!
[324:58.72]This isn't over!
[325:02.68]Oh, it's already... I'm right here.
[325:08.48]Did it all on your own?
[325:09.35]I know.
[325:09.87]I tried.
[325:11.77]Sometimes, you just gotta stick it out.
[325:16.61]Stick to it, is what I say.
[325:22.01]If you try hard enough, you'll do it.
[325:23.15]Huh?
[325:37.35]The hell are you doing?
[325:38.34]I can hear the fire crackle.
[325:41.58]And soon... I will see it.
[325:45.16]Okay.
[325:46.76]My thanks, Ashen One.
[325:49.64]I will finish the painting.
[325:51.20]I thought you just said you are horrible, Jerema.
[325:54.98]You are too humble.
[325:56.02]Jerema thinks he's Mario, but he's actually Luigi?
[326:04.01]No, no, you got it all wrong.
[326:05.81]I'm the guy with the camera in Mario 64.
[326:10.79]I just float around and look at stuff.
[326:15.74]What's his name?
[326:16.24]Lakitu?
[326:17.54]That was me.
[326:18.87]Make sure I get a good shot of it.
[326:21.01]Okay.
[326:29.31]What can I do up here?
[326:29.91]Is there anything I can even do?
[326:31.97]Item required.
[326:32.61]I'm about to just full blast swing at her right now.
[326:44.76]My son, I will have a cut so that it... Oh, I so badly want to just hold right trigger down and just use her brains as the painting material.
[326:54.60]Oh my god, that was terrible.
[326:58.43]That was awful.
[327:01.51]Oh, I so badly want to just smash her brains in.
[327:08.93]Alright, am I going to talk to the bird too?
[327:14.63]Yes, my favorite Mario character, Lakitu.
[327:21.87]Get discovered.
[327:22.67]Oh, she's a kid.
[327:28.54]I thought she was like an old woman.
[327:30.62]Oh, never mind.
[327:32.08]What I said sounds even worse now.
[327:36.24]What's this guy doing in here?
[327:38.72]This guy's phased in.
[327:43.73]Where's the bird guy?
[327:48.12]He's in one of these buildings, isn't he?
[327:59.54]Alright, you can make freedom.
[328:01.79]You can remove sub only.
[328:08.71]Yeah, I thought she was like in her 20s or something.
[328:11.69]I don't think she was like a kid.
[328:12.83]I retract my previous statement.
[328:21.30]Where's this bird guy?
[328:25.20]Yeah, it's time for the freedom chat for sure.
[328:34.59]Where's the bird guy?
[328:35.47]He's in here somewhere.
[328:37.33]He's not here anymore.
[328:42.68]Is he back at the original bonfire?
[328:48.80]Is he back at Firelink?
[328:51.26]There he is.
[328:51.62]No!
[328:53.94]Oh, my, thank you.
[328:58.41]I can hear the crackling from here.
[329:01.55]The sound of my home.
[329:04.05]The painting of Abindar.
[329:11.90]He gave me a Titanite slab.
[329:13.67]That scream.
[329:14.23]I'm a monster.
[329:16.89]Thanks for the Titanite slab, dude.
[329:20.15]Well, I think that's all she wrote.
[329:43.47]What do you think?
[329:43.83]One more?
[329:44.15]Can he take one more?
[329:47.43]Actually, I could use that slab on the... Ooh!
[329:50.39]Wait just a second here.
[329:53.51]Should I upgrade the shit out of these?
[329:56.37]I could.
[329:59.80]We could have the Vega Claws.
[330:01.76]That'd be cool.
[330:04.68]Let's go upgrade the hell out of these.
[330:14.07]See you later.
[330:17.88]Let's go upgrade these a ton and then I'll do some PvP.
[330:19.94]I'll just go to the PvP area for a few.
[330:28.33]Well, that was the... The DLC, I think.
[330:32.81]In regards to... PvE content.
[330:43.70]Let's reinforce these.
[330:45.80]Do I have enough?
[330:46.66]Hope so.
[330:48.00]Got plenty of shards.
[330:56.03]Titanite shard plus six.
[330:57.93]Yeah, I have enough, I think.
[330:59.19]Yeah, Titanite chunk.
[331:00.55]I don't think I have enough.
[331:02.91]I don't.
[331:04.55]I need two more Titanite chunks.
[331:06.25]Can I buy them?
[331:07.29]Yeah.
[331:12.04]Set the password and... Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
[331:13.78]That's the plan.
[331:16.21]Doesn't she sell, like, one or two Titanite chunks?
[331:19.83]Titanite scale.
[331:20.75]Titanite shard.
[331:22.95]Titanite slab.
[331:24.01]Come on.
[331:24.31]You don't have chunks?
[331:26.59]How do you not have Titanite chunks, lady?
[331:28.77]That's not cool.
[331:35.40]Yeah.
[331:35.64]Can one of the mods turn off sub only?
[331:37.22]Yeah, we're going to do arena brawls.
[331:41.94]Oh, they're plus, um... Thanks, Rayburn.
[331:49.10]That's... $37.50.
[331:50.61]Damn.
[331:51.09]That's a lot.
[331:53.51]That's $37.50.
[331:54.05]Yeah, I'm glad you enjoy the streams and the videos.
[332:03.05]I'm happy that people think the content... Ow, my dear!
[332:08.59]That, like, broke my hand.
[332:11.31]Oh, there are no mods here?
[332:12.31]Wow.
[332:12.41]Well, okay.
[332:15.81]How do I turn off sub only?
[332:16.81]Let's see.
[332:21.67]Slash sub only?
[332:27.18]How do I do it?
[332:29.80]But thanks a lot, Rayburn99.
[332:31.16]That's very nice of you, man.
[332:35.70]You want no mods without subs?
[332:37.00]Well, yeah.
[332:37.30]We have to let the freedoms in.
[332:38.94]Freedom chat.
[332:41.01]Also, thank you to Farrakas227.
[332:43.31]Thanks for the sub.

[332:48.17]Thank you.
[332:49.61]But yeah, Rayburn.
[332:51.85]That's very thoughtful of you.
[332:55.91]Yeah, what is it?
[332:56.45]Sub mode off?
[332:58.43]I don't have no idea.
[333:03.44]Okay, I think I can do it up from the dashboard.
[333:08.63]Quick, mod somebody.
[333:09.69]Alright, who's getting mod right now?
[333:12.81]Let's see.

[333:44.21]What a superior streamer.
[333:46.29]Thanks, dude.
[333:46.93]I appreciate it, man.
[333:48.37]Alright, you know what?
[333:57.48]Oh, I'm feeling it.

[334:57.23]He's like, shit, I don't even know how.
[335:00.83]And then we're going to do PvP with viewers.

[344:20.86]One player left.
[344:31.55]What happened to Karazhan?
[344:33.92]Um, I wanted to do this today.
[344:38.84]Just because, you know, it's new.
[344:41.07]And, obviously, I'm a fan of the series.
[344:44.73]So, this is 3v3.
[344:46.65]I should probably put on the katana.
[344:48.85]Alright, protect me.
[344:49.67]Alright, I'm okay.
[344:57.80]I'm alright.
[345:00.36]Why is this still on?
[345:06.26]Oh, you get one life.
[345:13.27]Put on the katana, please.
[345:14.23]Okay, let's go.
[345:18.29]We're doing it.
[345:25.81]Is that it?
[345:33.32]No, they're gonna spawn.
[345:34.28]Where'd they spawn?
[345:36.15]Across the map?
[345:47.17]Running!
[345:47.97]Running!
[345:55.66]Ooh, not good.
[345:57.20]Holy shit!
[346:02.58]I'm trying to get locked onto the right person and I couldn't.
[346:05.60]Fuck.
[346:17.65]I thought I could only... Well, I guess it's just minutes.
[346:22.76]God.
[346:25.32]Phew.
[346:47.04]Way more entertaining this is kind of a mess, but it's fun What are you guys doing in chat here?
[347:18.17]I see a lot of the brackets.
[347:24.65]I'm going to be honest here.
[347:26.85]Why don't we have just separate colors?
[347:28.67]It's hard to determine who's even on my team.
[347:31.37]Why can't it just be like red versus orange?
[347:33.32]Well, I mean like blue versus orange.
[347:36.00]Or like blue versus red or something.
[347:37.92]It's hard to keep track of who the fuck is even on your team.
[347:40.54]And who isn't.
[347:44.97]I mean, like, I guess the guys that have the names over their heads are, but so do they.
[347:48.85]She has one now.
[347:56.42]I don't even know what's going on.
[347:59.76]Oh, look out for the purple guy!
[348:01.56]There's the real Waluigi!
[348:02.68]I think that was one of the other guys as well.
[348:26.83]Come over here.
[348:27.35]We're both doing the same thing.
[348:35.06]God damn it!
[348:36.78]The guy wearing- my clone just killed me.
[348:39.42]Me and the scooter, we're wearing the same fucking outfit.
[348:50.89]And you get the guy opening his chest to shoot out a giant beam.
[349:01.99]How long does this go on for?
[349:10.02]I'm gonna do a 1v1 after this one.
[349:11.66]30 seconds.
[349:11.98]There's a guy on my team.
[349:16.88]Can I- whoops.
[349:17.40]Yeah, someone's gonna be behind me.
[349:26.59]No, not quite.
[349:27.47]Yeah.
[349:28.53]Hey, what's up, me?
[349:30.27]Oh my god.
[349:42.41]Okay, we've won.
[349:45.99]Crazy.
[349:48.07]Alright, now let's have some 1v1s.
[349:49.31]I'll do like... Hey.
[349:51.59]I'll do like one or two 1v1s.
[349:52.40]1v1.
[349:52.44]One on one.
[350:04.36]Can I change the arena?
[350:05.04]I don't think so.
[350:09.44]Alright, whoever the first one is, let's do it.
[350:14.46]Well, here's the thing with Dark Souls PvP.
[350:17.34]This is actually really great.
[350:19.08]Because you don't have to do the nonsense with putting soap signs down anymore.
[350:24.46]You can just get into this matchmaking kind of queue.
[350:28.22]I don't know how well it matches people up.
[350:30.28]But, you know, I'm sure we'll see.
[350:37.51]Come here.
[350:53.18]I'll get you with the Wolverine.
[351:24.85]Woo, that was a fancy move.
[351:29.35]Dammit, nice play.
[351:30.95]Good play.
[351:34.93]The soapstone's made the world bigger, though.
[351:38.83]Yeah.
[351:40.47]Well, I mean, if they add another couple of arenas to this, it might even exist.
[351:43.02]I don't know.
[351:45.44]It's just more controlled.
[351:46.46]It's an actually controlled environment.
[351:50.94]Let's go again.
[351:57.67]Streamer sucks.
[352:03.43]Hey, that wasn't very nice.
[352:16.63]Alrighty.
[352:21.01]Come here.
[352:28.39]I don't know why I'm trying to do that move so much.
[352:30.12]I just got fucking destroyed.
[352:36.62]I'm trying to do like the parry thing.
[352:38.62]I tried to do it like three times in a row.
[352:42.70]I don't know what the fuck I was doing there.
[352:46.84]Ban this guy.
[352:47.40]I don't even know what his name is.
[352:49.60]Ban him.
[352:49.90]Let's go again.
[353:00.94]Alright, this is my last one.
[353:14.09]And I'm gonna be taken off.
[353:17.64]Banned for winning, yeah.
[353:20.72]Alright, no more messing around.
[353:21.92]Let's do this one for real.
[353:24.04]This is a for real fight.
[353:25.16]I was going to let you do your thing.
[353:30.65]Are you taking a dump in a hole?
[353:36.92]What is that?
[354:02.86]Ooh, a little scrape.
[354:29.47]He's trying to throw knives at me to end it.
[354:31.99]What's he doing?
[354:32.44]He's got no weapon.
[354:33.06]I don't know what this is.
[354:35.86]This is not safe!
[354:39.18]I just spit everywhere.
[354:48.46]Did he... Did he die too?
[354:50.46]I think he might have died.
[354:59.07]One more.
[354:59.47]One more.
[354:59.89]Last one.
[355:00.35]Last one.
[355:01.01]Did he die from that too?
[355:04.03]That's a wash.
[355:04.69]That's a tie game.
[355:05.31]Hey!
[355:22.60]Hey!
[355:56.01]It hurts, doesn't it?
[356:01.47]Shit, that was mistimed.
[356:04.05]That was two.
[356:12.42]Thank you for playing.
[356:12.98]0 and 4 incoming.
[356:19.26]Come on.
[356:19.88]I don't like... I don't like play this game.
[356:26.27]What a great excuse.
[356:27.99]I don't play this game.
[356:31.31]Of course I do.
[356:31.95]I just played it for six hours.
[356:37.77]Perfect.
[356:38.15]Yeah, perfect 0 and 4.
[356:44.62]Do you remember that?
[356:45.10]Clap is BM.
[356:46.06]Should I ban?
[356:46.98]What?
[356:47.52]What's BM?
[356:48.30]Oh, what he did?
[356:49.70]I wasn't even paying attention.
[356:50.40]My eyes were even off the screen.
[356:51.96]Hey, let's just kill the whole room again.
[356:53.76]Because we're not going to play Dark Souls 3 ever again.
[356:55.56]Why not just slash this lady once?
[356:57.78]Oh, I was joking.
[356:58.70]I didn't even mean to do it.
[357:00.60]I didn't think I was going to instantly kill her, but I did.
[357:04.48]I thought it was going to be... Oh, you heard me.
[357:05.96]It's okay.
[357:06.44]You can still talk to me.
[357:07.18]She's dead.
[357:09.90]Sorry, Grandma.
[357:14.35]Alright, well, I think that's it for today.
[357:21.88]Yeah, I got to get some stuff done.
[357:23.90]I've been going for about five or six hours now.
[357:30.42]Restart.
[357:31.56]Next DLC regret.
[357:33.56]I'm going to have to go and get my sins absolved next time.
[357:42.15]What about sorcery?
[357:42.69]We're going to play sorcery tomorrow.
[357:48.41]Bet you won't stream for three more hours.
[357:50.05]Yeah, I can take you up on that bet.
[357:55.22]Final consensus on the DLC.
[357:58.48]Bloodborne's was ten times better.
[358:04.18]It was fun.
[358:04.64]Yeah, it was good.
[358:07.04]But if you compare it to the last game that they made, the DLC pack for Bloodborne was... They're planning on doing another one, right?
[358:14.54]For Dark Souls 3.
[358:17.74]So maybe when they do the second DLC, it will add up to the amount of content that was in Bloodborne's.
[358:24.35]But I think that just as it stands right now, that pack was way more interesting than this one.
[358:30.63]There were like four bosses, I think, right?
[358:38.26]In the Bloodborne DLC.
[358:46.71]Cheated the last boss though.
[358:48.37]Yeah, I was kind of just messing around there.
[358:49.99]Just doing it for fun.
[358:53.35]I probably will play through this just off stream on another character and obviously won't summon Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Wario.
[359:05.29]Bloodborne didn't have a Mario Party.
[359:06.97]Final thoughts.
[359:15.37]Play some Mafia.
[359:16.03]Yeah, tomorrow is going to be either Sorcery 4 or Mafia.
[359:22.00]And then Friday, either one of them.
[359:23.80]It'll be either Mafia 3 and then Sorcery or Sorcery and then Mafia 3.
[359:32.74]Some people loved that last boss.
[359:34.12]Oh, it's cool.
[359:35.28]It's just I can't say I'm a huge fan of tiered bosses in these Souls games.
[359:40.52]Because it makes dying way more punishing.
[359:42.22]And you're going to fucking die in these games.
[359:43.94]You're going to die a lot.
[359:46.26]So when you have tiered bosses in a game like this, it just causes frustration.
[359:50.44]Because when you lose, you have to go through all the tiers again.
[359:52.82]I wasn't a huge fan of it when they started to do it.
[359:57.24]And I'm not a fan of it now.
[359:59.42]Especially three tiers.
[360:01.06]That's pushing it.
[360:02.95]The last boss of this game, the original base game, was two tiers.
[360:07.00]And that was like, holy shit, that was hard.
[360:08.78]Doing three is just... Feels painful.
[360:15.96]It's definitely like the... I like the encounter.
[360:17.40]Like, the encounter's cool.
[360:23.75]It was solid.
[360:24.77]It was fun.
[360:27.83]But like everything, I compare it to Bloodborne.
[360:33.84]to Jewel Wizardry.
[360:38.71]And I'm pretty- I'm very biased.
[360:40.55]Bloodborne's one of my favorite games ever made.
[360:43.05]So.
[360:44.41]It's hard to say.
[360:45.29]Oh, well, yeah.
[360:47.15]Easy enough for you, because Bloodborne's like one of your top five favorite video games ever made.
[360:51.16]Yeah.
[360:51.78]There you go.
[360:56.24]You're gonna pardon these heinous bins, you shitlord?
[360:58.98]That was harsh.
[361:04.33]But yeah, thank you DarkEnd12.
[361:08.07]Last minute kind of sub here.
[361:12.65]NextSTV, thanks for 100.
[361:14.21]Great job, Darren.
[361:14.95]Thanks, man.
[361:17.13]Main focus was PvP, so story content was sacrificed.
[361:19.34]Yeah, it makes sense.
[361:21.02]And there are a lot of people that aren't me that are going to be really happy about the PvP changes, I would assume.
[361:26.04]Isn't there like a very large Dark Souls PvP community?
[361:30.81]You have to assume those people are going to be very happy that they have an actual thing, an actual place to go now, right?
[361:43.76]Do another run-through of Bloodborne on stream?
[361:46.28]Um... I don't think so.
[361:51.95]I thought about doing that before, but...
[361:55.26]I don't know how interesting it would be considering it's all content I've seen like five to six times in a row already.
[362:01.47]See, playing a game like this on stream is interesting because I don't know what the hell is going to happen.
[362:08.41]So playing Bloodborne, I know exactly where everything is and what everything does.
[362:11.69]So it's like, oh, watch me play through a game I've beaten like seven times.
[362:15.24]I don't know.
[362:21.12]But that's going to do it.
[362:23.80]Thanks for sticking around, everybody.
[362:26.95]This has been Bloodborne's DLC.
[362:30.26]Much love.
[362:30.66]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[362:32.60]Tomorrow we're going to start at 7pm.
[362:34.26]The regular normal time.
[362:37.00]And yeah.
[362:37.98]Thanks for hanging out again.
[362:39.19]Thanks to all the new subs.
[362:40.07]Everybody there.
[362:40.51]There's a lot of money from... I feel like I say this every stream.
[362:43.65]There are some people that drop money.
[362:46.15]Big money when I stream.
[362:48.94]I feel like I'm repeating myself when I say that.
[362:52.02]But, like, it's true.
[362:53.22]I can't believe people would be willing to give me, this random dude, that kind of money.
[362:58.10]So, thanks, guys.
[363:00.19]I'll see you tomorrow, 7 p.m., whatever it happens to be, the Mafia or Sorcery 4.
[363:05.91]Have a good night.
[363:06.59]Take care.
[363:08.71]Much love.
[363:09.33]Good luck.
[363:10.23]Bye-bye.
