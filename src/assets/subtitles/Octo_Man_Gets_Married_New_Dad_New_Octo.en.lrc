[00:09.06]Wow, look at all these beautiful gifts.
[00:10.50]Look at this one.
[00:11.06]This one, who's this from?
[00:13.06]To the bride and groom.
[00:15.50]We love you very much.
[00:17.34]Here is a toaster.
[00:19.40]See if I give a shit.
[00:20.73]No, I thought, why is there another door here?
[00:35.17]Nobody- Who leaves gifts like this in a hallway?
[00:39.09]What's with all the stuff here?
[00:42.03]Seriously?
[00:42.51]Oh!
[00:44.52]Hello, everybody!
[00:46.40]People are watching you.
[00:47.22]If you make a mess, you'll get suspicion.
[00:48.64]Get too much- Okay, I'm not gonna make a mess.
[00:51.60]I'm just, like, coming down the aisle.
[00:55.04]Nobody's at this wedding, by the way.
[00:56.64]Where's all my fucking family?
[00:59.30]The only thing that's here is a fish!
[01:02.31]I'll show you a wedding!
[01:04.17]My parents didn't even show up!
[01:06.05]My brother-in-law's sick!
[01:07.77]Nobody came to my wedding but your fucking family!
[01:10.51]Hi.
[01:13.33]Let's get married.
[01:14.11]I brought you a toilet seat cover.
[01:17.91]Do you like it?
[01:19.03]Do you love it, honey?
[01:22.03]Where's the ring?
[01:24.48]Where's the ring?
[01:24.96]I don't know where the ring is.
[01:27.30]How am I supposed to know this?
[01:29.72]Is it in this toy box?
[01:32.54]It is.
[01:34.74]Look at all these gems!
[01:35.90]Look at all these diamonds and jewels!
[01:38.62]You want like a shitty wedding ring?
[01:39.96]There's like ancient Mayan coins in here!
[01:43.27]Why would you want a wedding ring?
[01:45.63]Just get it off my hand.
[01:47.19]Get down there.
[01:47.81]Get it.
[01:48.57]There it is.
[01:49.73]Yeah, here.
[01:50.09]Here's your ring.
[01:51.79]Congratulations.
[01:53.55]But first I have something to say.
[01:57.15]To you, Dad.
[01:59.57]You doubted me all these years.
[02:01.69]You said that I would never be anything.
[02:04.67]And now I own my own restaurant.
[02:07.18]And you're not allowed in there.
[02:09.04]I love your daughter.
[02:10.56]Okay, let's continue.
[02:15.02]Where does the ring go again?
[02:16.55]Is it in the face with the ring?
[02:19.07]Is that where the ring goes?
[02:20.39]I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... Boppy, boppy, boppy.
[02:25.31]It looks like a baby rattle.
[02:30.10]Look, look, ready?
[02:30.60]It's gonna look up, like, off-camera.
[02:33.54]This is so dumb.
[02:38.20]Alright, put your hand out.
[02:39.04]Let's get this over with.
[02:44.00]I'm, like, burning my hand.
[02:46.02]Hey, that one fell on the floor, but it's alright.
[02:47.52]It's a five-second rule.
[02:49.26]This one will be for, like, the little Gregory.
[02:51.87]He didn't see it.
[02:54.24]If little Sally really cares that much about eating a piece of raw frozen meat, then you know what?
[02:58.23]She can cook it herself.
[02:59.59]Fucking goddammit, it keeps falling on the floor.
[03:05.39]Is nobody paying attention to the fact that I have dropped these patties on the ground like ten times?
[03:14.19]I hope everybody wants like E. coli for breakfast.
[03:18.40]I can't do it.
[03:20.98]I can't.
[03:22.58]I'm burning them.
[03:23.92]Do you think the neighbors are gonna care if I do this?
[03:31.32]We're throwing all these in the neighbor's yard.
[03:33.90]We have way too many of these.
[03:36.28]You know what I think about Todd?
[03:38.54]Next door?
[03:40.78]That's what I think of Todd.
[03:42.78]And his bullshit.
[03:44.98]His music.
[03:46.18]This is what you get for playing music at like 10pm on a Sunday.
[03:51.08]Some of us have to work, Todd!
[03:55.41]I gotta chop some firewood?
[03:58.47]This is dangerous.
[04:01.65]Did I just do it?
[04:02.31]No, this is a really messed up thing to try.
[04:06.20]But I just want to see.
[04:07.92]I have to be sure.
[04:09.88]I have to be sure, you know?
[04:13.40]You just have to be sure sometimes that the thing that you want to try could potentially cause a lot of problems.
[04:25.20]I missed.
[04:26.70]I missed.
[04:27.72]Figures are back in stock by popular demand.
[04:30.45]I'm just gonna go this way.
[04:31.59]Time to go shopping.
[04:32.94]What do you mean, the last Sports Johnson cereal?
[04:40.26]That's mine.
[04:41.46]Sorry, lady.
[04:44.57]Put that down.
[04:45.13]Hey!
[04:47.53]You know, you're looking at me.
[04:48.63]That means I can't steal it.
[04:51.86]Yeah, just go look at those bags of soup over there.
[04:54.78]Oh, just look at that.
[04:56.60]Very nice cart you have here.
[04:58.49]Very good dynamics.
[04:59.95]Very good... God, you fucking cereal bitch.
[05:04.77]This is a very big jar.
[05:07.07]And when she turns her back, I'm gonna put this in her cart.
[05:09.29]And she's gonna have to pay for it.
[05:13.58]I didn't buy that giant tub of lard.
[05:15.64]No, we're gonna put it in this guy's cart.
[05:18.18]Screw this lady.
[05:20.15]We're gonna put it in somebody's cart that doesn't- Oh.
[05:22.59]I didn't mean to hit you.
[05:26.08]See this lady right here?
[05:28.90]You sure you didn't order a giant thing of lard, lady?
[05:31.64]Get in her cart!
[05:33.84]Be a dick, yes!
[05:34.42]Yeah, this milk looks pretty good!
[05:49.50]God, I'm so sick of waiting in lines.
[05:53.85]You know, I don't have to wait in line to get these tickets.
[05:57.13]Screw this.
[05:57.53]I'm just cutting everybody.
[05:59.11]Sorry, lady.
[06:00.97]Yeah, thank you.
[06:03.85]See?
[06:04.15]Cutting in line doesn't... Nothing's wrong with cutting in line.
[06:08.98]See?
[06:10.20]It's easy.
[06:11.68]You steal the register.
[06:14.00]You take the register with you.
[06:16.54]You know what?
[06:16.88]I don't even need to go to the aquarium.
[06:19.04]I just took like two grand from your fucking cashier.
[06:24.16]Let's get out of here, kids.
[06:25.92]I'll buy you a new PS4.
[06:33.63]You know, one of us is going to end up having to take their hand off this.
[06:38.43]And it ain't going to be me.
[06:43.97]Lead Stacy through the jellies.
[06:45.93]Okay.
[06:46.63]Come with me, Stacy.
[06:48.29]I'm not scared of the jellyfish.
[06:50.44]Your papa's not scared.
[06:51.96]He was a World War II veteran.
[06:54.26]Hard as iron.
[06:55.38]I could bench press 280 pounds.
[06:58.08]You have nothing to be afraid of.
[06:59.74]You ain't getting it by me.
[07:02.92]You ain't getting it by me.
[07:03.81]Nice try.
[07:04.25]Yeah, I know.
[07:05.61]I'm gonna show you an old trick.
[07:06.57]You wanna see an old trick that we used to do in the arcades?
[07:09.51]You do this.
[07:10.07]You keep it still.
[07:12.41]And then you- yeah.
