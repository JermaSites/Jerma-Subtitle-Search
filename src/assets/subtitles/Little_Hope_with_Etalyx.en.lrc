[00:03.78]Oh, fuck, my mic's on.
[00:05.30]Hey, hey, hey!
[00:06.25]Hey, guys, how are ya?
[00:07.87]How's everybody doing?
[00:08.83]Ugh, you're not supposed to hear me like... Alright, so, yeah, everybody, this is... I'm just here.
[00:16.05]Uh, so the... There's an M&M's commercial now for Halloween.
[00:19.96]And the implications in the M&M commercial are that the M&M's are fucking dead.
[00:28.20]The yellow M&M and the red M&M are walking around a house.
[00:31.10]It's like a scary house.
[00:32.07]And the red M&M's like...
[00:33.81]Hey, Yellow, we almost got eaten this year.
[00:36.83]Good thing that was a close one.
[00:38.59]And Yellow is a ghost walking through walls with a big bite out of his head.
[00:42.84]He's like, yeah, I think so too.
[00:44.80]Yeah, we really got out of that one.
[00:47.74]And this motherfucker's dead.
[00:49.28]Like, they killed the Yellow M&M.
[00:50.82]He's dead.
[00:52.20]Hey, Fred.
[00:55.05]He's dead.
[00:55.73]I'm serious.
[00:58.40]Can we watch it on stream?
[00:59.39]I don't think we can watch it on stream.
[01:02.93]This is like a commercial that came out like today.
[01:07.33]They're writing off the yellow M&M?
[01:08.81]No, I don't know.
[01:09.61]I'm just telling you, he's dead in the commercial.
[01:14.60]Run ads until we see it.
[01:18.72]Alright, we'll see it eventually.
[01:20.50]Just a couple more Samsung phone commercials.
[01:23.10]We got seven of them in a row.
[01:26.49]Run ads until we see it.
[01:29.90]I'm telling you guys, you'll see it on TV.
[01:31.60]The yellow M&M is dead.
[01:34.12]He's dead.
[01:35.86]He's a ghost with a big bite out of his head.
[01:39.74]Here it is right here.
[01:40.49]Is it?
[01:42.69]It's better not be bullshit.
[01:45.23]This is it.
[01:45.61]This is it.
[01:45.91]Alright, let's, let's, here we go.
[01:47.01]Let's watch this.
[01:47.87]Can I do this?
[01:48.51]Is this allowed?
[01:49.45]Can I watch an ad on TV?
[01:52.82]Well, it can't be.
[01:53.60]Is something wrong with this?
[01:58.46]We're just going to watch the part where it shows that he's dead.
[02:04.95]I'm not going to put it in the... Hold on.
[02:09.61]Here's... Just wait a second.
[02:10.87]I want to show this to you.
[02:20.24]Oh, look at that.
[02:20.98]Oh, no.
[02:21.34]That's my stream key.
[02:22.48]That's my stream key.
[02:23.12]Oh, that's my stream key.
[02:26.06]Alright, watch.
[02:28.00]Well, we made it to another Halloween without getting eaten.
[02:31.82]This year was a close one.
[02:33.93]Yeah, tell me about it.
[02:35.95]He's dead.
[02:36.31]He was killed.
[02:37.63]I don't feel anything.
[02:40.79]Uh, this can't be good.
[02:43.18]They killed the yellow M&M.
[02:44.42]That guy's fucking dead.
[02:50.87]Anyways, we're gonna play, uh, that was an ad?
[02:53.39]It was, but I was making my comments on that ad.
[02:57.64]So I was commenting on it.
[03:08.28]Yeah, see, no, I was transforming that content.
[03:11.39]See, what happened was, the ad played and I went, See?
[03:17.75]And I transformed it, and it turned into mine.
[03:23.47]This was transformed!
[03:25.90]ReactStriever.
[03:27.84]Anyways, hi guys.
[03:28.64]Let's go back to the intro, because we're not here yet.
[03:32.82]We are, but kind of not here.
[03:34.06]Back to the intro.
[03:36.40]You're shilling M&Ms.
[03:37.52]Guys, M&Ms have been around for like 150 years.
[03:39.49]I don't think they need any more advertising help.
[03:45.65]M&Ms, I wouldn't be surprised if they showed up in the national anthem, okay?
[03:48.51]It's been like 150 years.
[03:51.92]Everyone knows what a fucking M&M is.
[04:01.39]Spoilers for corporate takeover.
[04:02.97]Now, we're going to play Man of Badan.
[04:06.14]It's not Man of Badan.
[04:06.72]I keep calling it Man of Badan.
[04:08.64]It's the Dark Pictures Anthology.
[04:13.07]Little Hope.
[04:14.05]It's the second in that series that they're doing.
[04:18.16]And we're going to play with Etalyx.
[04:19.38]We played this with Etalyx last time, so might as well play them until they're going to do eight of these.
[04:25.40]See you in a year when the third one comes out and then they cancel the rest of them.
[04:31.16]I don't think they're going to do this for like seven or eight straight years from now.
[04:37.61]I think it's saying eight, I think might have been a little, a little much to say.
[04:44.55]That's almost 10 years, apparently.
[04:46.09]Because the last one came out a year ago.
[04:47.49]So, if they're on pace for 10 years of content, maybe this is just what they're going to do.
[04:53.27]Maybe Supermassive, they're just like, you know what, fuck it.
[04:55.39]Let's just do this scary movie kind of choose-your-own-adventure games, and that's just what we're going to do for the next 10 years.
[05:01.78]Maybe.
[05:03.40]I'll give them some credit where it's due.
[05:04.88]I mean, it's kind of interesting to be able to share a story like this.
[05:08.32]The first one was okay.
[05:10.92]It was okay.
[05:12.74]We had our fun with it.
[05:15.07]This is the second one.
[05:15.81]We're going to give it a chance.
[05:16.65]So, I don't know.
[05:21.25]We have no idea how this works.
[05:22.29]We're just going to do new story.
[05:24.83]And we're just, uh... Alex should be joining us in any minute here.
[05:33.67]You got scammed twice.
[05:36.86]Um... Well, no, I enjoyed the last one.
[05:40.70]I mean, it was... It was a little dopey, but it was still fun.
[05:46.12]Turn your face cam on?
[05:47.32]You might get a face cam for some of this stream.
[05:48.86]How's that sound?
[05:54.30]Driver install waiting room.
[05:55.75]I have the brand new driver from yesterday.
[05:59.65]There ain't any other drivers I can install.
[06:06.79]This one's good?
[06:09.55]Alright, I'll take your word for it.
[06:14.17]I think we're ready to go.
[06:16.59]Are we?
[06:17.57]Are we good to go?
[06:18.01]I'm good to go.
[06:18.61]Are you good to go?
[06:19.11]Ladies and gentlemen, that's... I am ready.
[06:23.04]That's Etalyx.
[06:24.32]Those of you that don't know.
[06:25.04]Oh, everybody knows.
[06:28.88]Everybody wants to see this happen.
[06:30.90]You think that these people in the stream haven't heard of me?
[06:36.31]Excuse me?
[06:39.45]We got an ego stroker here.
[06:40.83]Okay.
[06:42.90]Okay, I've got a bot trawling through the chat for anyone that hoo a Megalos.
[06:48.35]You're getting hoo'd like crazy right now.
[06:52.32]You don't hoo Etalyx.
[06:53.60]He's been around for like... We've known each other for like 10 fucking years.
[06:58.04]Listen, they're just revealing who is a fucking fake fan right now in your stream.
[07:03.60]That's true.
[07:04.06]These are people who have only just gotten to your stream in the last 365 days.
[07:11.51]Oh, shit.
[07:12.57]He's calling a lot of you guys out.
[07:14.91]And there's nothing I can do about it.
[07:16.21]I mean, I could just boot him.
[07:19.77]You ready?
[07:22.21]Let's go.
[07:22.79]Fake fans.
[07:24.69]You already get it.
[07:25.89]He is kind of toxic, though.
[07:27.40]I've asked him questions before, and he's like, what, are you dumb?
[07:31.90]I'm like, dude, no, I'm not dumb.
[07:32.94]What, are you toxic?
[07:34.38]And then he ghosts me for two days.
[07:35.66]It's like, fucking come on, dude.
[07:38.99]He's right.
[07:40.63]Oh, do you want to be Anthony or Tanya?
[07:45.19]Whoever is left over.
[07:47.23]Okay, so who do I want to be?
[07:50.31]Do I want to be Anthony?
[07:51.08]You're the, like, player one right now.
[07:53.32]Yeah, I am player one.
[07:56.14]Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony, Anthony.
[07:57.88]Alright, alright, alright.
[07:58.80]What is it?
[07:59.58]Oh, because Anthony Banthony.
[08:00.96]Okay, I guess that makes sense.
[08:03.92]Alright, you're going to be Tanya, I guess.
[08:06.43]Okay.
[08:10.27]Say you're ready?
[08:14.77]Hold on, you can't ready up on a controller, you have to push the enter button.
[08:17.93]Is he always on a controller?
[08:19.06]Or he's not even a PC gamer?
[08:24.92]Listen, I gotta get the last life out of this Xbox One Series X Elite Bundle version before it gets replaced in like... Did you put subtitles on?
[08:34.36]To play with a controller, press A. To play with point and click controls using a mouse, press this one.
[08:43.28]Was I supposed to select something?
[08:44.56]Because I just left clicked and then it started loading.
[08:46.86]Oh, you left clicked?
[08:47.74]I think you just selected keyboard and mouse.
[08:50.64]Did I really?
[08:51.08]Yep.
[08:52.34]Okay.
[08:53.28]Alright, shh.
[08:53.64]Don't talk during the cutscene.
[09:03.56]Unless it's some wicked funny you have to say.
[09:06.37]If you do, just talk over the fucking game.
[09:17.09]Already paused I didn't I was turning off the volume I Was gonna turn off the volume of the game alright do it just go go go go go go Hit the hit the button Holy gooey I'm sorry alright stop
[09:46.99]Was it a book called The Wild Dick?
[09:52.57]The romance section.
[09:54.69]The Wild Dick.
[09:55.89]This game's fucking boring.
[10:10.06]I don't think I'm... I don't wanna do this anymore.
[10:12.40]Oh, he drove a bus.
[10:13.24]This is fucking fun.
[10:26.47]I was just gonna say something, but I can't.
[10:28.75]I'm not gonna say it.
[10:30.99]Everyone's gonna leave if I say it, but who cares?
[10:34.91]I'm just gonna do it.
[10:35.47]It's so loud, but I can't alt-tap without pausing the game.
[10:41.56]Dude, this bus is... This bus is... I can't even... You know what I was gonna say.
[10:46.26]Who cares?
[10:53.83]I was going to say, yo, this bus is kind of sus.
[10:59.38]I did not know that you were going to say that.
[11:03.96]I told you you were all going to fucking leave if I did that.
[11:13.74]I don't think you're supposed to, like, block off roads with horizontal cones.
[11:16.72]Where's the subtitles?
[11:19.98]I put them on.
[11:20.48]Oh, I thought Little Hope was, like, the name of, like, a little kid or something.
[11:26.70]Like, Little Hope is, like, the scary girl.
[11:30.94]This is a school bus.
[11:31.40]I just want to get these folks to where they need to be.
[11:42.65]I doubt a short delay will trouble him too much.
[11:48.09]Head up the east road.
[11:49.57]Takes you straight through Little Hope.
[11:51.17]I will.
[11:51.39]There's almost no time to your journey.
[11:54.63]Oh, hey, dude.
[11:55.23]Did you know that the yellow M&M's dead?
[11:59.15]Good.
[12:05.31]Damn.
[12:06.05]Alright.
[12:22.45]You rub that chip any harder, it'll wear away to nothing.
[12:25.45]Is he imagining this or are the people in the bus doing this?
[12:27.49]How long have you been sober?
[12:29.89]A few days shy of three months.
[12:31.72]Are you suggesting the people in the bus are psychic?
[12:34.10]No, I feel like people talk on a bus.
[12:38.48]I know it doesn't add up, but...
[12:40.93]I get something from holding on to this.
[12:44.58]We're going the wrong way.
[12:47.02]It's fine.
[12:47.72]Just a quick detour.
[12:48.96]It's not fine.
[12:50.38]Calm down.
[12:51.50]It's all okay.
[12:53.12]Oh, please, John.

[13:43.40]I think all is like, um, describes sounds and like... Yeah, but I had them on.
[13:50.94]I think I have mine on minimal.
[13:52.58]Were you getting subtitles during that cutscene?
[13:54.80]Yeah.
[13:55.28]I wasn't.
[13:55.68]What the fuck is this?
[13:56.46]It's supposed to be going through my TV.
[13:59.75]This is bullshit.
[14:02.63]I'm playing on TV.
[14:04.87]Hang on, you have a TV?
[14:07.55]Yeah, I'm doing it through TV because I don't wear two headphones.
[14:12.69]Look.
[14:15.91]I'm one headphone Andy.
[14:25.46]Listen, I don't think there's been a co-op stream in history that hasn't had at least five technical difficulties.
[14:31.18]This is fine.
[14:33.14]I'll just turn it up.
[14:35.54]Are you good?

[15:06.03]Is the game playing for you?
[15:09.59]No, it says you keep pausing the game.
[15:11.11]I'm not.
[15:14.51]It's just a nice screensaver of this winter home.
[15:18.90]There's nothing on my screen.
[15:21.38]It says pause by e-tel.
[15:22.82]I have not.
[15:23.60]I've done no such thing.
[15:26.50]Do you have a controller?
[15:27.77]Press start.
[15:30.11]There's no menu.
[15:30.91]If I hit escape, the mouse disappears.
[15:33.03]Okay, what about now?
[15:35.32]Listen, I don't like throwing out red flags within the first 10 minutes, but I think it crashed.
[15:41.49]It did?
[15:46.35]Well, alright, we'll just start over and we'll skip the first cutscene.
[15:49.07]Alright, I'm going to return to main menu.
[15:56.37]And then I'm going to invite you again.
[16:00.85]Wait, Etalyx.
[16:01.35]Have you updated your graphics drivers?
[16:04.94]In general, or like literally yesterday?
[16:06.80]Because there was a new driver yesterday.
[16:08.28]Yeah, for the Watch Dogs.
[16:09.34]You needed the Watch Dogs Legion driver.
[16:10.86]Okay, shared story.
[16:14.97]Let's go.
[16:16.35]Writing your session.
[16:17.09]Okay, I'm inviting you.
[16:23.75]I just gave you an e-vite.
[16:27.85]Watch Dogs is cursed.
[16:31.84]Watch Dogs Legion waiting room.
[16:34.02]Oh, you're going to be waiting a real long fucking time.
[16:40.07]I would rather play The Surge 2 sitting on a spiked chair.
[16:44.75]Did you say The Surge 2?
[16:46.17]Yes, then open up Watch Dogs Legion again.
[16:48.64]Did you get my invite?
[16:51.10]I haven't even gotten... Okay, I just got back to the main menu.
[16:54.02]Sick.
[16:58.10]No.
[17:03.47]I hate transitional buttons so long Saw 2 waiting room both those games are never showing up ever again
[17:15.29]Dude, should I just play Surge 2 on a spiked fucking chair?
[17:19.31]Would that be like TOS?
[17:21.55]I don't think you would last 30 minutes.
[17:23.45]No, but if it was like a fake spiked chair and I'm sitting there going like... No, I don't care about the spiked chair.
[17:28.73]I'm talking about the Surge 3.
[17:30.53]I don't think you would last 30 minutes.
[17:32.59]You think I could sit on a spiked chair longer than I could play the Surge 2?
[17:35.95]I do.
[17:36.53]In separate circumstances?
[17:39.29]That's so funny.
[17:40.41]Okay, we'll see.
[17:43.36]So you're saying that I would be okay getting tortured than play The Surge 2?
[17:48.24]Yes.
[17:48.40]Alright, I'm writing out.
[17:52.98]What's your other bottom two game?
[17:54.68]It's The Surge 2 and... Evil Within 2.
[17:59.60]Really?
[18:00.26]I hated that game.
[18:00.74]I didn't think that was as bad as The Surge.
[18:03.07]Yeah, Mario Tennis.
[18:08.51]What?
[18:10.33]How can someone hate Mario Tennis?
[18:12.25]I hate that game.
[18:13.03]It's fucking stupid.
[18:13.73]I hate it.
[18:14.13]Okay, what about, like, Rockstar's Table Tennis?
[18:17.65]I didn't play it.
[18:19.59]Wow.
[18:22.38]That's toxic?
[18:23.70]What?
[18:23.96]You guys know that I don't like Mario Tennis.
[18:25.68]That's not, like, a secret.
[18:26.64]Alright, continue the story.
[18:29.68]Do you have a button to press?
[18:33.64]I have already pushed it.
[18:36.14]This is... Okay, here we go.
[18:37.86]You know what, I think... Alright, take two.
[18:39.20]I think there's just too many people playing this right now and the servers are having problems.
[18:42.42]Welcome to any game that's released after 2015.
[18:47.12]Play it three weeks later and the game will actually work.
[18:51.70]There's no such thing as a game launch anymore.
[18:54.23]They just, like, back up a dump truck and dump the code out on your front fucking lawn.
[18:58.91]And then somebody shows up, like, three weeks later and cleans up the garbage on your front lawn.
[19:07.33]Well, this is probably good because the first time I didn't know I was supposed to push the controller button.
[19:13.52]Alright, we go.
[19:13.90]We're good.
[19:14.34]This is it.
[19:14.74]We're ready.
[19:16.16]We're in the house now.
[19:25.84]Stop it, James.
[19:27.30]You know I hate it when you don't take the things I say seriously.
[19:29.96]Come on, sweetheart.
[19:31.74]I do.
[19:32.56]I just had a rough day today.
[19:35.20]Can you believe they are at each other again?
[19:38.21]I can.
[19:40.54]You're drunk.
[19:41.78]What a surprise.
[19:42.30]She is drunk.
[19:42.62]The kid's drunk?
[19:43.26]Just caught the game with the guys, honey.
[19:45.22]That's it.
[19:45.76]That's not it.
[19:46.82]Never is.
[19:47.76]We're drunk again, darling.
[19:49.39]Some of us may be losing our jobs.
[19:51.13]The factory.
[19:51.63]You've been saying that for years.
[19:53.79]I'm more worried about Megan.
[19:55.11]What's wrong with Megan?
[19:56.63]She looks okay to me.
[19:57.45]Everything looks okay after 10 beers.
[20:00.27]Reverend Carson held her back after prayers today.
[20:02.60]That's four weeks running.
[20:05.12]She's not right.
[20:06.04]It's serious, James.
[20:07.24]You worry too much about that kid.
[20:09.12]I can't deal with this right now.
[20:10.60]Another surprise.
[20:12.06]You can't deal with anything.
[20:13.72]When would be the right time?
[20:15.05]You're making a mountain out of a molehill.
[20:17.05]Boston.
[20:17.59]Getting yourself worked up for nothing.
[20:19.23]For nothing?
[20:20.87]Single-handedly keeping our family together is far from nothing in my book.
[20:25.21]I could use a little help.
[20:26.21]Maybe if we'd had kids of our own, none of this would be happening.
[20:29.14]That's a
[20:30.62]It's a weird role for Chevy Chase to be doing.
[20:32.48]You're not the only one who feels pressure!
[20:34.69]The factory situation is serious, Anne!
[20:37.17]Real serious!
[20:39.97]Not right now!
[20:40.69]Alright, here we go.
[20:50.45]That is the one.
[20:50.91]Not tonight.
[20:52.30]Is that one of your photos?
[20:54.36]I don't know.
[20:55.06]Wait, me?
[20:55.64]Like, actually me?
[20:56.22]Like, that could be you as a kid.
[21:01.93]It kind of looked like me when I was little.
[21:07.30]Yeah, it's the Clark family.
[21:08.86]No, sorry, it's the Clark family home.
[21:10.02]Uh... Hey.
[21:10.20]Hang on, I'm... That was me that just did that.
[21:16.62]Okay, I'm this kid here.
[21:17.26]Okay.
[21:31.51]He came in last week.
[21:33.47]We shot the breeze a little bit.
[21:35.83]I like him.
[21:37.63]That's the Bandersnatch kid.
[21:39.45]What's his name?
[21:43.59]He's in Meet the Millers.
[21:52.44]Ben Shapiro?
[21:53.22]That's not Ben.
[21:55.14]What?
[21:55.36]What are you fucking talking about?
[21:57.55]Nah, you've done it.
[22:02.03]Hey.
[22:02.57]There's no need to be so tough on her.
[22:04.59]It was an accident.
[22:05.67]Everything Megan does is an accident.
[22:08.07]It's up.
[22:13.15]Shapiro.
[22:14.80]Why?
[22:15.04]Okay, it wasn't just one person that wrote that.
[22:17.74]Like, a hundred of you did.
[22:18.92]Damn ice.
[22:22.60]Hey, can you come let me in?
[22:23.42]I'm locked out of the house.
[22:25.92]Oh, this is you.
[22:27.68]I'm going to start climbing through the window unless that door gets fixed.
[22:33.65]what your character looks like they're wearing a wig how's things so let me guess he's been pumping iron again they've been at each other's throats since dad got home actually no that's just me from 2006 but like with blonde hair you're really thinking about whatever you're about to say sometimes they sound like a broken record same thing again and again
[22:58.78]It might help if you actually gave a fuck, you know?
[23:01.40]You know?
[23:02.12]For once.
[23:03.14]Go for yourself.
[23:04.16]Nothing new here.
[23:05.26]They've been arguing since we were in diapers.
[23:08.24]Well, you were in diapers.
[23:10.92]I was better trained.
[23:12.87]Dennis, for the ten millionth time, will you shift that shit of yours up into the attic?
[23:17.23]Hey, some respect.
[23:19.33]This is a valuable, rare, and sought-after collection.
[23:23.57]My amiibos.
[23:26.29]I'll just take these to my room.
[23:27.41]They're Pokémon cards, Mom.
[23:29.31]Didn't you see Clay Ferry is worth $355,000 now?
[23:32.89]What's curled up his ass?
[23:36.92]He's being a jerk.
[23:37.68]He's being even more annoying than usual tonight.
[23:40.90]A real jerk.
[23:42.24]So what else is new?
[23:44.74]Funko Puffs.
[23:52.77]Is that a doll of her?
[23:58.54]That's weird.
[23:59.06]Is a ghost doing it?
[24:16.86]Why is that scary?
[24:21.13]She just walked into the room that the mom was in.
[24:23.35]Why is that scary?
[24:24.07]Holy shit, a child.
[24:24.69]That lives here.
[24:25.91]Holy shit.
[24:40.88]I love the idea that they've apparently lived with her for years, but she's just really scary tonight.
[24:45.96]Yeah.
[24:46.16]Are you going to lock everybody in?
[24:54.63]Maybe you should talk to mom and dad.
[24:56.33]It's not a great idea for me to get involved.
[24:58.83]You know what I'm like?
[24:59.51]I just upset someone.
[25:00.93]They sounded more serious than the usual bullshit.
[25:03.83]He looks down.
[25:04.29]We're talking about Megan.
[25:05.77]She's done something bad.
[25:08.50]I can't say I'm surprised.
[25:09.54]There's definitely something off with Megan.
[25:11.22]I don't get why everyone keeps picking on her.
[25:13.06]Okay, Mr. Shining Knight in Armor.
[25:16.30]Where's the little princess anyway?
[25:19.20]Hmm.
[25:22.87]Megan's gone upstairs.
[25:24.55]Maybe you could go check on her.
[25:26.09]If you don't have other plans.
[25:28.73]I'll go find her.
[25:33.37]Ooh, this is the first split of the evening.
[25:37.01]Second, actually.
[25:38.03]Oh, is it?
[25:38.51]You had to open the door for me, remember?
[25:40.03]Oh, that's right.
[25:42.63]Hmm, what do we have here?
[25:49.69]Okay, who cares?
[25:50.77]Oh, okay.
[25:55.50]Can't that... Wouldn't that explode your house?
[25:58.64]That scares the shit out of me when people do that.
[26:00.08]Wouldn't it light the gas line underneath and blow up the fucking house?
[26:02.48]Get these guards!
[26:06.40]You know I can't see what you can see, right?
[26:08.30]Oh, we should mute them.
[26:11.58]We're just in time with the heartbeat?
[26:13.64]I'm sneaking by dad.
[26:14.28]Don't wake daddy.
[26:15.28]We're Parker Brothers.
[26:16.50]What?
[26:18.62]What?
[26:36.45]You need to keep an eye on your little sister.
[26:38.71]It was right click, right?
[26:40.27]It was the easiest thing ever.
[26:42.99]It was right click.
[26:43.68]I can't imagine why.
[26:48.08]I'm not a moron.
[26:50.24]I'm not a fish.
[26:51.34]I'm a person.
[26:52.06]I'm a human.
[26:52.88]I'm a human man.
[26:55.87]The devil himself would struggle with you guys.
[27:04.74]Check on Tanya.
[27:05.56]Press to move to a location.
[27:07.90]Stop moving.
[27:09.92]The screen is just to move in that direction.
[27:11.84]It's like, wait, it's point and click?
[27:15.16]Oh, okay, so should we do TV?
[27:16.14]Alright, we gotta go check on Tanya.
[27:19.73]You know what would be really funny?
[27:21.23]If he's just waiting for me up there and I just get lost in the house and his stream is fucked because I cannot find a way up the stairs.
[27:29.01]I don't think he realizes that that's possible the entire time we play this.
[27:37.51]Ooh, examine.
[27:41.79]Trout of innocence.
[27:43.93]Alright, pick it up.
[27:45.06]A must read for anyone with an interest in the Salem Witch Trials of 1692.
[27:51.28]This takes place during the Salem Witch Trials.
[27:57.20]150, 200 years in the future.
[27:58.37]Pretty cool.
[28:05.41]Wait, what's this?
[28:08.58]The New England Witch Trials.
[28:12.36]Mmm.
[28:12.48]What does that say?
[28:15.04]The New England Witch Trials.
[28:16.48]Right.
[28:16.74]They just say the name of the book on the spine.
[28:18.52]Right.
[28:19.46]What rugs is he on?
[28:20.36]I'm not on any rugs.
[28:22.28]Today's not a CBD day.
[28:27.05]Okay, I gotta go get Tanya.
[28:28.13]Upstairs?
[28:28.69]Upstairs?
[28:38.06]Alright, imagine walking around your house like this, like you have no idea where the fuck you're going.
[28:42.42]I can't, I can't, what?
[28:49.46]Oh, we're locked in.
[28:50.14]She locked the door.
[28:52.12]She locked it.
[28:52.64]The little kid locked it.
[28:53.42]Alright, I'm going to go upstairs so, like, Etalyx' stream isn't ruined.
[28:58.51]So, he's upstairs.
[28:59.03]Alright.
[29:09.93]I don't know what that is.
[29:11.79]Stairs?
[29:18.93]This is just what your dog does when you leave for the day.
[29:30.28]And then eventually I'm going to walk around in a circle three or four times.
[29:33.54]Jesus Christ!
[29:38.10]I'm gonna walk around the circle three times and lie down.
[29:48.36]Open the door?
[29:49.05]Where is Tanya, though?
[29:51.15]I'm never gonna find him.
[29:55.91]Wait.
[29:59.65]Anthony, where are you, goddammit?
[30:02.79]Anthony, I'm getting really...
[30:05.36]I'm sorry Etalyx.
[30:06.34]I'm coming.
[30:07.46]I'm coming.
[30:08.14]I'm coming Hey Etalyx did I hit the enrage timer on my family?
[30:16.88]Uh, I think this I think I did this oh I think so too.
[30:22.09]I yoinked you I think Tanya what's going on that little brat locked me out.
[30:27.65]It's fucking freezing.
[30:28.85]Oh
[30:31.46]Too hot, too hot.
[30:32.50]I thought that was her for a second.
[30:36.41]Burning her head in the fire.
[30:37.75]Alright, if this is you, how long does it take you before you try to kick the door down?
[30:47.51]Uh, I am putting my.
[30:48.82]I'm going to break every bone in my body to get this open.
[30:50.76]Megan!
[30:51.18]You in there?
[30:53.46]I'm going to full on jump through the glass and shatter every bone in my body and get all cuts all over me and shit.
[30:58.38]Is the floor made of gasoline?
[30:59.88]The kitchen's on fire!
[31:13.40]This is quick.
[31:15.26]Dad!
[31:17.06]Good thing, hey, good thing I woke him up.
[31:18.66]Did we have prevented this?
[31:20.72]Everyone's just dying.
[31:36.91]We just accidentally killed everybody?
[31:39.42]Why is everybody trapped in the house?
[31:42.44]Dum dum!
[32:08.51]Why did that take, like, five minutes?
[32:11.13]It's so loud.
[32:13.69]Come on, Dad.
[32:14.39]You can do it.
[32:16.75]Oh, Jesus.
[32:17.35]This is bad.
[32:18.15]Get her out of there.
[32:42.06]They'll teach you to argue with your family.
[32:44.76]Did she do that?
[32:54.10]Why did she do this?
[32:58.63]Why is she like, do you bleed when you breathe smoke?
[33:01.63]I think so.
[33:02.49]It burns you up.
[33:05.43]Yeah.
[33:13.94]What are you gonna do?
[33:14.62]Tanya, hold on!
[33:17.12]I gotta get Megan out!
[33:18.36]You're gonna go save Megan?
[33:19.78]Alright, now roll your outro credits for your stream.
[33:22.71]Megan!
[33:29.19]What?!
[33:30.87]Holy shit!
[33:34.23]Oh my god!
[33:38.08]Oh, that
[33:50.09]What happened?
[33:51.63]What happened?
[33:56.71]What did you do?
[33:58.65]What did you do?
[34:00.07]What happened?
[34:14.34]Are you did you take control of this character?
[34:22.39]I'm sorry.
[34:23.23]I don't know what I did.
[34:24.01]I don't know what I did the least lucky family Why are they all getting like Mortal Kombat?
[34:41.93]Did you like the fire?
[34:43.86]No, I don't think so.
[34:45.82]What the fuck did I do then?
[34:47.71]What are you doing?
[34:48.95]Why would you do that?
[34:53.23]I'm going down with the ship.
[34:57.29]He sprints in as the buildings collapse.
[35:01.84]I think that was just the intro.
[35:03.34]I don't think any... Yeah, that's scripted.
[35:08.10]That's pretty nuts.
[35:10.24]I gotta like alt tab again but I don't want to crash the game did you see by any chance what happened in the house uh besides the fire starting though I mean I saw like the guy crawling and getting crushed by beams and okay dude literally the little girl burnt to death like she was on fire mtv music video
[35:35.50]They literally burnt a kid to death.
[35:39.27]Like, she was on fire.
[35:40.71]It was fucking insane.
[35:45.23]Uh, well, was it as insane as my character hanging themselves with a scarf?
[35:49.15]I mean, it was... The whole thing was just fucked up.
[35:51.57]Oh, we're supposed to... We're supposed to know... Hold on, we're gonna get DMCA'd for this, aren't we?
[35:59.20]Oh, yeah.
[36:00.04]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[36:02.16]You just said the key word for today.
[36:07.63]I hope it was worth it.
[36:10.43]Alright, this is real.
[36:11.75]Somebody in my feed actually got a YouTube claim.
[36:15.99]From this?
[36:16.57]From Bandai Namco.
[36:18.68]For like a cutscene.
[36:20.12]Oh, fuck.
[36:21.46]What do we do?
[36:22.08]Do we turn it off?
[36:28.84]Music?
[36:30.72]I'm gonna leave it on.
[36:31.72]Ah, fuck it.
[36:32.14]Who cares?
[36:32.54]It's just a game song.
[36:37.77]I think that they custom made it for the game.
[36:39.79]No, no, this is like Pearl Jam, I think.
[36:49.75]Why is it running so shitty?
[36:54.09]And what, why is this hallway so long?
[36:55.69]It's Pearl Jam.
[37:06.23]I ship her massive games.
[37:11.87]Listen, I just want you to know that when both of our channels get deleted, it was a pleasure that we go down with what IGN has called a 5 out of 10 experience.
[37:23.60]Is it?
[37:28.25]Is it a 5 out of 10 game?
[37:30.33]According to IGN, yes.
[37:36.37]IGN giving a game a 5 out of 10 means it's a 0.
[37:46.18]I don't think I believe that so far.
[37:47.42]I was... Hold on.
[37:51.42]I remember this guy.
[37:53.14]Who's in the window?
[37:53.82]Hmm.
[37:54.90]Hi.
[38:08.00]Guardian of all these wonderful stories.
[38:10.30]We have met though.
[38:11.34]Yeah, we have.
[38:11.80]And I have a very special tale for you to tell.
[38:15.24]We were talking before the stream started and we were like, yeah, it definitely doesn't remember your save.
[38:18.59]They didn't put that in.
[38:21.95]I want the Mass Effect experience.
[38:29.12]Salem Witch Trials in his encyclopedia of scary stories.
[38:33.58]Disconcerting, no?
[38:36.22]This guy looks like Bugleberry.
[38:37.94]Is this like a stick bug joke?
[38:40.94]This particular story isn't fully fleshed out.
[38:45.22]It's only part written.
[38:46.54]And the choices you make will complete it.
[38:53.33]The fire.
[38:54.69]No, there was nothing you could have done about that.
[38:57.55]What's happened has happened.
[39:00.23]Or has it?
[39:02.23]Anyway, look to the future, I say.
[39:05.69]Life's but a walking shadow, eh?
[39:10.37]You are about to enter a confusing, perhaps disturbing path.
[39:17.00]I like the idea that he's actually talking to a camera crew.
[39:18.94]How disturbing might depend on what you choose to believe and how confusing on the path you choose to take.
[39:29.64]There are an infinite number of directions in which one could travel.
[39:34.12]Actually, there's three in this game that actually matter.
[39:38.30]Left option, right option, and say nothing.
[39:40.91]Right.
[39:41.25]And hope that we get the clarity and the outcomes that we want.
[39:47.01]You see, you will be determining the outcome of this tale together.
[39:51.63]What one does will often affect the other.
[39:54.97]So even though you are two people, you'll be completing the story as if you were one, if that makes any sense.
[40:03.68]As in life, the actions you take matter.
[40:07.14]They will determine how your story resolves.
[40:10.58]You can't go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the end.
[40:17.56]We get to change the fire?
[40:18.50]Have you seen how the story starts?
[40:22.98]So much death.
[40:26.28]He leans down and just screams into the book.
[40:27.78]How many more deaths is entirely up to you.
[40:29.90]Do you think they made this intro because they watched our man of a Dan complain about how long it took for anyone to die?
[40:36.57]Do you trust your head or your heart?
[40:40.80]There is no right answer.
[40:42.80]They're like, oh yeah?
[40:44.56]What if I kill every character in the first intro?
[40:47.56]What now?
[40:48.20]They just give us new characters.
[40:51.62]Alright, I didn't sign up for poetry class.
[40:54.86]I want to fucking see monsters and Satan and stabbing.
[41:01.53]Okay, but like, you did.
[41:04.05]That's what we just did.
[41:07.25]I'm not supposed to interfere, you see.
[41:10.50]Not my place, apparently.
[41:14.23]But I am apparently allowed to share wise words from great storytellers that have gone before where I feel that that would be appropriate.
[41:28.39]Oh, one final thing before I let you go.
[41:33.03]There are pictures in Little Hope that will, if found, show you a vision of a possible future.
[41:40.60]I'm sorry, that's just like... Google.com, a black cat looking to camera.
[41:49.18]No, but just the way he said that, he's like, there are photos.
[41:51.47]Like this one of my kitty.
[41:52.87]Hmm.
[41:56.47]I do enjoy a good funeral.
[42:03.67]Here we go.
[42:07.09]Cue the rock music and the car driving really fast and the teenagers just not listening to any fucking rules.
[42:14.66]Never mind, it's a funeral.
[42:23.27]The Bible's all wet.
[42:23.91]Who are these people?
[42:50.77]I mean, not to be like, didn't everybody die?
[42:54.23]The guy with the keychain thing is Tanya's... Well, am I allowed to tell you anything?
[42:59.41]I don't know.
[42:59.83]Do you have info that I'm supposed to know?
[43:01.65]I don't know.
[43:02.41]I don't know what I'm supposed to say or not say.
[43:04.53]Oh, I think it's alright.
[43:05.79]If we're sitting in the same spot, it's fine.
[43:08.66]The one guy is Tanya's boyfriend.
[43:10.70]Oh, okay.
[43:12.92]She's dead, though.
[43:13.80]When we're not standing in the same spot, that's when we... Wait, this bird's alive.
[43:21.93]18?
[43:21.95]Dude's like 36 in real life.
[43:26.27]Wait, but he's alive.
[43:36.54]Where is he?
[43:40.32]Taylor, 22, college student, headstrong, sensitive.
[43:43.78]Do I get to create a new character now?
[43:45.58]Gone.
[43:47.16]College professor, rational, overbearing.
[43:49.66]where the hell's Daniel I can't find him I don't know oh you were it's on the bus goofing around you want to lend a hand oh right I forgot about that I thought that was just that was so long ago and so random that it was like what's the point of this what do you want me to do John call for help if you can manage that
[44:12.42]Calm down, genius.
[44:13.46]I already tried making a call.
[44:15.36]No signal.
[44:15.96]So try again.
[44:16.82]Asshole.
[44:18.50]Hope this gets through the fog.
[44:21.99]Alright.
[44:24.33]I'm headstrong.
[44:25.99]Hey, Andrew, buddy.
[44:27.65]Angela, 18.
[44:28.65]Mature student in college.
[44:31.03]What happened?
[44:32.43]The bus crashed.
[44:33.59]We're okay, though.
[44:34.31]Just shaken up.
[44:36.25]If you say so.
[44:36.95]What?
[44:37.53]I don't remember being in any crash.
[44:41.22]You're probably in shock.
[44:42.57]Maybe a mild concussion in there, too.
[44:44.65]Give yourself some time.
[44:48.15]I thought they were at the fire.
[44:50.11]No, this is the bus crash.
[44:51.67]That was just a dream.
[44:52.51]This is going to be a Freddy Krueger thing.
[44:57.23]You can die in a dream, in a nightmare and stuff.
[45:04.00]Fuck.
[45:04.80]Where's my phone?
[45:09.31]Alright, we gotta mute.
[45:10.77]I think.
[45:14.93]Who do I control?
[45:17.15]Angela, 48.
[45:18.17]Mature student.
[45:19.59]Abrasive.
[45:20.31]Understanding.
[45:20.88]What do you mean mature student?
[45:22.06]But it did tell us who we are.
[45:23.06]So you're Taylor, I'm Daniel.
[45:24.88]Okay.
[45:26.88]Hey, anyone up there?
[45:30.14]Hey, Daniel, that you?
[45:32.12]John, good to hear you.
[45:33.92]Daniel?
[45:37.77]Taylor, you okay?
[45:39.47]I'm good.
[45:40.15]We're fine, too.
[45:40.91]Thanks for asking.
[45:42.33]You okay down there?
[45:43.13]Nobody's good.
[45:44.09]I'm alright.
[45:44.99]Nothing I can't deal with.
[45:46.57]I really hope that the old lady doesn't die.
[45:47.94]Any idea what caused the crash?
[45:50.16]I'm gonna do everything possible to make sure that that old lady stays alive.
[45:55.06]He down there, by the way?
[45:57.62]Nope.
[45:58.42]No sign of him.
[45:59.37]Weird.
[46:00.35]He isn't up here either.
[46:01.93]Can you get back up to us?
[46:03.77]Looks pretty steep.
[46:06.20]I see a trail down here I could try.
[46:07.58]I mean, that's not that steep.
[46:10.22]Should take you to the road.
[46:12.04]We can regroup there.
[46:14.02]That's a plan.
[46:15.18]See you soon.
[46:16.57]I want to control... No, I want to be the old lady.
[46:18.97]I like old ladies.
[46:22.35]Hey, Taylor.
[46:24.57]Help me get Andrew up on his feet, will you?
[46:27.28]Wait.
[46:28.36]I don't remember anything.
[46:30.60]Who are you?
[46:32.04]It's an amnesia.
[46:33.52]You're concussed.
[46:34.52]I'm John.
[46:35.02]You're a college professor.
[46:36.76]You were taking a bus on a field trip, but that didn't work out so well.
[46:40.38]Crash wasn't on the curriculum.
[46:41.70]Where are they taking these kids on this field trip?
[46:43.60]We'll find the others.
[46:45.04]Get some help.
[46:46.30]Think of it as a character building exercise.
[46:55.22]Teamwork at its finest.
[46:57.07]I didn't fail the first QT.
[46:58.17]We're good.
[46:58.61]It was so real.
[47:01.55]flames all around us it was grim that bang on the head must have been a beauty that trail the others are on will come out down the road we'll meet them there uh why don't we just call somebody to help us through why leave the bus not like we have somewhere better to wait there's food in that bus we could be here all night there's a bathroom in that our best move is to get to the others then head towards town see if we can find some help
[47:26.92]What about the guy that drove the bus?
[47:28.36]Where's the driver?
[47:29.46]Shouldn't he be back by now?
[47:30.34]Wait, did he drive the bus?
[47:31.01]The driver's done what we should be doing.
[47:32.75]Gone into town for help.
[47:34.05]Oh, no, the guy, the bus driver, like, okay.
[47:38.85]He could just as easily have banged his head and walked off the other way.
[47:43.73]Fine.
[47:44.59]You can stay right here.
[47:46.25]I'll go myself.
[47:47.15]Oh, fuck you, John.
[47:47.99]What do you know?
[47:48.45]Hey, professor!
[47:51.43]He is a professor, right?
[47:54.21]Hey, look, he's a professor of fucking artificial flavorings.
[48:00.29]It was a really easy class to take.
[48:02.85]Don't put that much judgment on him.
[48:04.32]What is that?
[48:04.66]Letterbox?
[48:04.94]Letterbox?
[48:05.16]Yeah, I have a letterbox.
[48:05.82]Are we not supposed to have letterboxes?
[48:24.00]I kind of like it.
[48:24.84]Are we together?
[48:27.02]I don't know.
[48:27.34]I haven't seen Taylor.
[48:27.82]Oh, okay.
[48:28.00]Mute.
[48:28.18]There's nothing here.
[48:30.46]Alright, leave.
[49:01.99]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[49:04.22]He's gonna get scooped up by an eagle or something, isn't he?
[49:06.28]I know he is.
[49:07.74]He's going way too fast in front of us.
[49:14.82]Why are there MOBA controls?
[49:16.77]Hold on.
[49:23.29]Daniel and Angela should be here soon.
[49:28.13]There's a chain around the gate.
[49:34.27]Now what do we do?
[49:34.99]Doesn't that fucking hurt after a while, by the way, if you click that much?
[49:37.95]People that play League and Dota all day.
[49:40.93]Good to see you two, finally.
[49:43.89]Everything okay?
[49:44.95]Sure.
[49:46.19]We took the scenic route.
[49:47.78]You sure as hell took your own sweet time.
[49:49.74]I was getting worried.
[49:52.34]I bet you were.
[49:54.46]I love her.
[49:55.04]I love her already.
[49:56.54]This gate is chained.
[49:57.74]We can't get through.
[50:00.86]Look around.
[50:01.73]See if there's anything we can use to break it.
[50:06.99]Think this'll do it?
[50:09.46]Just bash it with a stick.
[50:11.24]Ready?
[50:12.36]I'll push hard from my side.
[50:13.51]Ready.
[50:14.65]Three, two, one, push!
[50:19.40]Oh, that was easy.
[50:19.98]Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[50:21.12]Great job, you two.
[50:21.78]See how fast we did that?
[50:23.20]Oh, these are real college kids.
[50:24.60]Paying attention at how leverage works.
[50:27.20]I'm just waiting for a car just to drive and just... All of them.
[50:30.42]What's the plan now?
[50:31.74]I already said I want to wait at the bus for help.
[50:33.28]This is the detour road.
[50:34.52]Not head into town like John wants.
[50:36.63]Nobody goes this way.
[50:37.75]That's why we crashed and were pissed.
[50:39.15]Not with everyone here, we didn't.
[50:40.45]I'm a psycho?
[50:41.03]We should vote on it.
[50:42.09]No need for a vote.
[50:43.41]Decision's made.
[50:47.77]you scared you'll lose I'm playing a certain character it's not gonna be a vote I'm sorry but we really don't have we're both playing certain characters you'll stay here with me won't you uh looks like he ain't so keen after all that's right if you got something to say to me spit it out come on typical of your type to get your boyfriend to fight your battles for you
[51:14.61]Ah, she's kind of a bitch.
[51:15.99]I don't like her anymore.
[51:20.67]I'm not wasting another breath.
[51:21.95]No, I liked her!
[51:23.23]You don't know what's between the two of us.
[51:25.45]I mean, there's nothing.
[51:28.20]What have you been telling her?
[51:29.70]I didn't say a thing.
[51:30.68]Keep out of our business, okay?
[51:31.96]Oh, now she's sad.
[51:39.36]You take yourself far too seriously.
[51:41.25]Lord knows why.
[51:45.05]Oh, no.
[51:49.05]No, I like her again.
[51:51.31]What was that?
[51:52.43]What was that for?
[51:53.53]Is nobody going to bring that up?
[51:55.11]Why were you just violently coughing?
[51:56.11]Alec, are you alright?
[52:14.36]Why is your character, like, the most manipulative?
[52:17.11]I still think the smart move is for us all to stick together.
[52:19.89]That's how I'm playing it.
[52:21.13]After we flag down a car and come rescue your ass.
[52:25.89]We were all on the fire.
[52:27.21]I mean, we were all on the fire.
[52:28.79]This is... Coughing, the... You get lost?
[52:37.12]No.
[52:39.02]Back here?
[52:40.70]This doesn't add up.
[52:42.88]Didn't Silent Hill do this like 15 years ago?
[52:44.15]I don't know what you're trying to prove here, but we've got better things to do.
[52:46.79]Fuck.
[52:46.99]I don't want to be a main character anymore.
[52:49.71]Write me out of the story, please.
[52:51.63]It's not possible.
[52:53.75]Sprint.
[53:14.23]This is just the world's largest treadmill.
[53:21.02]I am so confused.
[53:22.08]What is happening?
[53:22.96]Why are they doing this?
[53:24.24]They start walking one way and they end up... I walked away from you.
[53:30.62]We're trapped here.
[53:31.64]They're doing time skips.
[53:33.90]I don't understand.
[53:37.67]She's right.
[53:38.75]We walked dead straight going away from you.
[53:42.23]How did we end up back here?
[53:44.54]My question, how long did these other three people stand waiting for them to do this three different times?
[53:48.66]Yeah, how far is it?
[53:49.54]Is it a mile?
[53:50.68]Two miles?
[53:51.00]Five miles?
[53:51.34]Alright, make your prediction right now.
[53:52.28]Who's the first to die?
[53:52.98]Who do you think?
[54:13.92]uh just out of the people we've played as or this whole group just like this group here who's the first to go guy with glasses I would say the same thing professor's dead first like I said an eagle's gonna swoop him out of the sky I admit that is a little odd more than a little see what did I tell you it's just like I've been saying we are trapped we can't leave here okay calm down breathe
[54:42.59]There's a rational explanation for what's happening.
[54:45.47]Maybe we all died in the crash.
[54:48.43]Yeah, nice theory, but I'm pretty sure we're all still alive and kicking.
[54:52.25]Throwing that one out right at the beginning.
[54:53.45]Last I checked, you were schooling us on creative writing, not metaphysics.
[54:57.16]I know who I'd like to be kicking.
[54:58.78]This is all down to you, this pissy little field trip.
[55:01.70]Now we're stuck here in little no hope.
[55:03.44]That is way out of line.
[55:04.10]How can we hear them twice?
[55:05.72]Did you hear an echo too?
[55:06.32]I had no way of knowing that damn bus would crash.
[55:08.36]You can't put that on me.
[55:09.78]Are you for fucking real?
[55:11.68]Watch your tone, will you?
[55:12.86]I am doing my best to understand this, just like you and the rest of us.
[55:20.95]They're trying to get us to kill each other.
[55:22.51]I'm sorry.
[55:23.83]I don't get what's happening here.
[55:24.75]I'm diffusing the scenario.
[55:25.49]I don't understand.
[55:27.20]It's like you said.
[55:27.90]We're trapped in a nightmare.
[55:30.08]It's okay.
[55:31.30]We're going to be just fine.
[55:33.22]We'll figure a way out of this together.
[55:35.26]Someone else thinks they can do a better job.
[55:38.32]Step right up.
[55:39.34]The real nightmare is 50 miles an hour on a two-lane road.
[55:41.93]We have to get out of here right now.
[55:43.55]I need to think straight.
[55:45.05]What?
[55:46.03]We're on drugs?
[55:47.13]Can everyone just shut up?
[55:50.62]This isn't helping us find help or getting us out of here.
[55:55.47]He's right.
[55:56.83]Bitching at each other isn't getting us anywhere.
[55:59.37]We have to work together as a team.
[56:01.53]Thank you.
[56:03.89]They should just hold hands and have one person keep walking while they keep holding their hand and see if their arm rips off.
[56:08.59]What?
[56:08.75]Like make a chain and shimmy to the left.
[56:18.17]Until the person all the way on the left disappears or gets their arm ripped off.
[56:22.04]Okay, let's take that instead of ripping their arm off.
[56:26.80]Start breaking off like tree branches.
[56:29.24]And use those as like links.
[56:33.80]Just build a shelter and live here.
[56:35.98]Eat the fucking rabbits.
[56:37.60]No, not one person has checked their phone for a signal.
[56:41.65]We should stick together.
[56:45.69]Oh, he zoomed in on that.
[56:46.95]We were just in a car crash.
[56:51.91]Dude, you have a scratch on your face.
[56:53.32]What the fuck happened?
[56:54.58]We were just in a fucking car crash, stupid.
[56:56.64]What are you talking about?
[56:57.42]Alright, stick close to the others.
[56:59.40]Follow John.
[57:00.04]They're already going.
[57:00.62]Alright, go, go, go.
[57:05.12]RB pauses for some unknown reason.
[57:16.53]Here we go again.
[57:17.15]Uh-oh.
[57:19.01]Listen, I'm not the developer that made RB on a controller pause the whole game and then crash the game.
[57:25.24]It's not my fault that you get softlocked after a single pause in the game.
[57:30.86]Okay?
[57:31.16]There's no menu on my screen.
[57:33.62]So is this... So now you're locked out?
[57:37.04]What about now?
[57:39.54]Like, there's no menu.
[57:40.50]What if I go like this?
[57:41.06]It's just a screenshot.
[57:45.22]Nothing?
[57:47.40]Alright, let's go back to the main menu.
[57:48.42]Let's do it again.
[57:48.88]We gotta continue.
[57:49.54]We gotta start right here.
[57:50.22]Speedrun.
[57:51.70]I need to figure out if there are any other buttons that just pause the game for some reason.
[57:55.93]So I don't push them.
[57:59.11]Surge 2 in waiting room.
[58:01.49]Alright, that actually kicked me out back to the main menu without having to restart the game.
[58:07.33]Why does right bumper pause the game?
[58:09.03]That's odd.
[58:18.48]This is your out.
[58:19.72]Take it.
[58:21.16]No.
[58:23.34]We just started.
[58:24.06]We're in like chapter 1 after the prologue.
[58:30.98]Alright, I invite you.
[58:31.79]Alright, you good?
[58:38.25]It's doing like a 10 second long animation, but yes.
[58:42.21]Uh...
[58:43.58]Are they supposed to be here?
[58:44.58]Like, looking like that right now?
[58:47.34]I feel like they just got ported in here for no reason.
[58:52.51]I don't think these models are supposed to be here.
[58:53.81]Five out of ten?
[59:06.02]I wouldn't say that yet.
[59:15.05]I wouldn't say that yet.
[59:15.80]Sorry.
[59:16.60]Hey, look.
[59:16.90]I don't get what's happening.
[59:19.36]I didn't do that.
[59:20.18]I think it's just telling us we have to choose a play style.
[59:26.70]I don't understand.
[59:27.76]Can we skip this?
[59:28.65]It's like you said, we're trapped in a nightmare.
[59:31.03]No.
[59:31.53]It's okay.
[59:32.75]We're gonna be just fine.
[59:34.67]We'll figure a way out of this together.
[59:36.73]Someone else thinks they can do a better job.
[59:39.77]Step right up.
[59:41.56]Maybe it isn't real.
[59:42.36]Maybe it isn't real.
[59:43.34]We have to get out of here.
[59:44.30]Alright.
[59:44.70]The guy said, does someone else think we could do a better job?
[59:47.11]He's been standing still.
[59:48.41]Can everyone just shut up?
[59:51.17]For half an hour.
[59:52.07]This isn't helping us find help or getting us out of here.
[59:55.11]The only thing they've tried so far is walk down the road three times.
[59:58.31]Fitching at each other isn't getting us anywhere.
[60:00.57]That's hard.
[60:00.89]We have to work together as a team.
[60:02.98]Thank you.
[60:05.54]Now let's be logical.
[60:07.75]The fog is between us and the bus.
[60:11.07]There is no fog between us and town, so let's head that way.
[60:16.15]I don't get how heading further away from the bus helps.
[60:19.75]When did we establish the fog was what was looping us back in time?
[60:22.83]I think they just guessed.
[60:24.92]In town, there will be people, a working phone, something.
[60:28.26]Hey, we played Man of Medan.
[60:29.42]The fog is just like a barrel leaking somewhere that's going to like...
[60:37.03]If they do Amanda Medan again, where it's like this is a gas in the air and it's making us just like crazy, then I'm not buying the next one.
[60:47.81]You know what I mean?
[60:49.41]This is the town that produces the gas.
[60:57.32]Spoilers for Man of Medan.
[60:58.60]Yeah, but this is Man of Medan 2.
[61:00.62]Smog of Medog.
[61:02.18]Smog of Medog.
[61:03.82]Alright, Etalyx.
[61:05.88]Is this game Man of Medan 2 in your brain?
[61:08.82]This is not Little Hope.
[61:09.95]This is Man of Medan 2.
[61:11.25]This is not the Dark Pictures anthology.
[61:12.97]Cat.
[61:13.11]Cat.
[61:13.23]Cat.
[61:13.31]Cat.
[61:28.96]I hope there's some Monty Python level shit where the cat just like jumps up and bites one of our necks.
[61:41.69]So that's the dude's cat.
[61:42.97]Yeah.
[61:43.91]That's the storyteller.
[61:45.78]Why are you doing this like Chad side to sidewalk?
[61:50.14]I'm not.
[61:50.48]I'm just going, man.
[61:52.78]I didn't see it.
[61:57.86]Who am I now?
[61:59.60]I'm Taylor.
[62:02.16]Oh, I think I'm her.
[62:03.22]Are you Old Lady?
[62:03.90]God, I wish that was me.
[62:09.37]We should check it out.
[62:10.95]There could be a phone inside.
[62:13.71]I'll go in and take a look around.
[62:16.59]Go ahead.
[62:17.63]We'll be right behind you.
[62:21.82]Why aren't we going with those guys?
[62:24.04]Angela knows there's something between us.
[62:25.22]Why aren't we going with them?
[62:25.92]That's obvious.
[62:27.22]I'm sorry, it's a horror game.
[62:29.12]You have to split up.
[62:29.68]We've got no other bigger shit to deal with tonight.
[62:31.66]I'm talking to you right now?
[62:32.38]This is a big deal.
[62:33.42]For me, anyhow.
[62:34.97]No, wait.
[62:35.47]I'm telling you.
[62:36.15]Wait.
[62:36.99]Why can you hear this?
[62:38.45]She knows.
[62:40.49]Because you're like six feet away.
[62:42.25]I've seen that before somewhere.
[62:46.57]Did you blab to her about us?
[62:47.95]Of course not.
[62:48.58]Didn't say a word.
[62:53.79]You absolutely sure you didn't blob about us?
[62:56.61]You don't believe me?
[62:58.41]I believe she's smart enough to- I went down.
[63:00.76]I got down on Daniel.
[63:02.42]Daniel, I have down arrow.
[63:05.50]I just wanted to be sure.
[63:08.36]I don't know what I did wrong.
[63:09.60]You better, well, I'll let Chad take it from here.
[63:16.95]Everyone is Ben Shapiro.
[63:18.44]Yeah, that's wicked funny.
[63:19.40]Even me.
[63:19.70]Me too.
[63:19.96]All of us here are Ben.
[63:20.52]All of us.
[63:46.13]Ew, stop.
[63:47.39]Hey, you brought it up.
[63:48.23]I didn't bring it up.
[63:49.39]I'm reacting.
[63:50.03]I'm going to react, Andy, to what you're doing.
[63:59.47]This is the most business this bar has gotten?
[64:02.21]Yeah, this guy, I'm surprised he doesn't jump up and start wiping the counter and being like, what can I get you?
[64:09.42]Holy shit, five people.
[64:11.40]Ding, ding, ding, ding.
[64:12.16]Hi there.
[64:15.41]Hey, your bus crashed too?
[64:19.83]Yeah, sure, it's a thick one tonight.
[64:21.39]Thick.
[64:44.73]This is the character that knows the kind of mysticism behind the town, right?
[64:49.17]No.
[64:49.39]This is the character that got stuck here before you did.
[64:52.55]Oh, shit.
[64:52.73]God damn it.
[64:53.03]You're right.
[64:53.49]Sounds like fighting talk to me.
[65:13.60]I'm playing darts.
[65:14.48]Let's do it.
[65:18.46]How do you play darts?
[65:20.72]Go for single 20.
[65:24.08]What was that supposed to be?
[65:26.32]Single 20.
[65:31.07]Beginner's luck.
[65:32.67]Try for double 7.
[65:35.55]Double 7.
[65:36.65]I don't know what that means.
[65:38.33]Right here?
[65:38.83]At least my eyesight seems okay.
[65:41.83]Right here?
[65:43.09]Great shooting.
[65:44.57]Go for the bullseye with your last dart.
[65:46.25]I just turn and I throw the dart right into his eye.
[65:53.96]Okay.
[65:54.84]You got the walk to back up the talk.
[65:56.96]Stop pretending.
[66:00.60]Stuck her with these guys because of that fog?
[66:02.60]I just did it.
[66:03.62]How do you feel about all this shit?
[66:09.23]We're in deep shit here and those guys are no help.
[66:12.56]Don't beat around the bush.
[66:13.68]Say what you're really thinking.
[66:15.60]You doing okay?
[66:17.70]I felt better.
[66:19.78]Am I trying to save us from the fog while you're playing darts?
[66:23.25]Probably.
[66:23.73]I'm just having a good time over here.
[66:26.57]Wait.
[66:26.87]This is an important decision.
[66:30.39]This one.
[66:30.65]Just because he's our professor doesn't mean John can act like he's in charge.
[66:34.35]Are you talking about me in front of me?
[66:36.93]I'm right.
[66:37.76]I thought you were with me on this.
[66:39.42]Let's go and check in with the others.
[66:41.72]They need to figure out how to speak with volume control.
[66:44.68]Yeah, you're gonna hit the fucking wall.
[66:54.33]You're gonna be that guy that's at the party that throws two into the guy's fucking wall, the drywall.
[66:59.65]And it's like, fuck!
[67:00.63]I'm gonna be... How much is the drywall, man?
[67:02.58]I'm sorry.
[67:05.78]No, no, don't worry about it, dude.
[67:06.88]Don't worry about it.
[67:07.60]Like, just, uh, just give it to somebody else.
[67:09.83]No, I'm literally playing now.
[67:12.35]Oh, you are playing.
[67:13.77]I took the controller out of your hand and made you go look around.
[67:18.00]William Tell, can I just stand there?
[67:20.10]Shooting for double 20.
[67:27.17]Okay, my game just got stuck.
[67:29.34]This place is a bust.
[67:30.74]There's nothing for us here.
[67:32.48]For once, I agree.
[67:33.36]The sooner we're gone from this dreadful place, the better.
[67:36.38]Damn, I'm a professional dart player, apparently.
[67:40.67]I hit a bullseye, too.
[67:43.33]You don't aim for the middle.
[67:45.09]I hit three bullseyes in a row.
[67:48.05]You actually don't go for the middle, though.
[67:50.34]This is what you do every time.
[67:52.44]When you throw the second one, it splits the first one in half.
[67:55.10]And the third one splits the second one in half.
[67:56.94]Talk to this guy.
[68:00.68]What?
[68:00.96]No, he didn't.
[68:03.54]I want to talk to this person.
[68:06.31]I could use a shot of that right about now.
[68:16.89]I really got cut down on the booze.
[68:23.45]Get some info.
[68:24.21]Let's get some info.
[68:24.87]We found a secret.
[68:25.41]There's a Red Sox fan?
[68:25.97]That's not a Red Sox hat.
[68:27.85]It is?
[68:28.09]It's a D.
[68:51.35]I can't escape.
[68:53.32]It doesn't look like there's a bevel where the B is supposed to be.
[68:55.86]It looks like the D socks?
[68:59.14]No, that's not a Red Sox hat.
[69:05.18]That's not a Boston Red Sox hat.
[69:09.03]Dead Sox.
[69:09.93]Yeah, that's not a B. I mean, I know where they're going.
[69:12.39]I mean, there's probably trademark laws where you can't be like the Boston Red Sox, maybe.
[69:23.10]Dead sec.
[69:26.35]Why is everyone just eerily sitting around?
[69:30.69]The Zostin Zedzocks.
[69:32.63]Alright.
[69:33.81]That's enough.
[69:34.25]I don't want to hear it anymore.
[69:37.47]Alright, what do I do?
[69:40.25]Who do I talk to?
[69:40.89]I want to talk to... Can I talk to him?
[69:50.93]God damn it.
[69:51.63]I'm just being an NPC in every video game.
[69:57.44]I'm just waiting for someone to come over and hit me with a fucking chair for fun.
[70:08.32]What's this?
[70:10.28]Oh, it's a secret.
[70:11.24]Turn it up.
[70:11.58]It's upside down.
[70:14.84]This is riveting gameplay, Jerma.
[70:16.96]It's a story game.
[70:18.38]What do you want?
[70:19.40]To go drive a car and run over 100 people out there?
[70:21.98]It's a story game.
[70:27.85]Let's continue on into town.
[70:29.63]Oh, I may have yoinked everybody.
[70:30.87]Let's get out of here.
[70:32.17]I was just walking around like an NPC anyways.
[70:35.17]You all hear that?
[70:37.27]I definitely heard something.
[70:40.43]Did you hear that as well?
[70:44.95]Come on.
[70:46.33]Whatever it was came from outside.
[70:48.51]Why are we assuming that that guy cannot hear that?
[70:51.37]We need to move on.
[70:55.81]By the way, one of the, like... Best of luck.
[70:59.49]Hope you find what you're looking for.
[71:03.19]Yeah, and... Dustin, dead socks!
[71:07.24]Docs, I said it wrong.
[71:08.06]That's not what I... I didn't shoot those there.
[71:13.91]Okay, so based on the lore that I found, I hope the story's not going the direction that I think it is.
[71:19.78]It's a lot of -2 as fuck.
[71:26.52]It's coming from the town.
[71:29.68]Did the old fucker just lock us out?
[71:31.83]He was weird, that old guy.
[71:33.25]It's like 11 p.m.
[71:34.87]It's closing time.
[71:35.91]I come to Creepy Central just to get a top up.
[71:38.59]What does that mean?
[71:42.36]Yeah.
[71:43.16]Cool.
[71:43.62]I am Andrew.
[71:46.00]I am Angela.
[71:47.96]Let's go.
[71:49.96]Continue toward the town.
[71:50.74]Keep up with John and the others.
[71:54.94]Hey, guys.
[71:55.22]I got a key.
[71:55.56]Yeah, sorry.
[71:56.08]We're controlled by players.
[72:00.08]You just go squat over there and, like, piss behind a bush.
[72:02.51]That'd be funny.
[72:03.01]Dude!
[72:06.83]No!
[72:11.56]Come on, hit start.
[72:13.82]Hang on, let me ready first.
[72:15.18]You unready, because I still have a menu here.
[72:17.59]Who's supposed to ready first?
[72:19.29]You.
[72:20.83]Like, what have we done last time?
[72:22.07]Do you ready first last time and that's what freezes us?
[72:25.15]I don't know.
[72:25.57]They made too many buttons on the controller pause the game for no reason.
[72:30.06]Listen, in my defense, everyone knows when you're playing a new game and you got a controller, you push every button on the controller to see what it does, right?
[72:41.01]You just do.
[72:43.61]Alright, I'll go first.
[72:46.31]Yeah, I mean, I do press, like, every button on my keyboard.
[72:49.17]I just mash my face into it.
[72:51.37]Thank you.
[72:51.81]We're good.
[72:52.09]Alright.
[72:52.69]We're good.
[72:55.22]People telling you to stop using a controller.
[72:56.62]Okay, that's chat saying that.
[73:02.92]Do anybody even listen to what they say?
[73:06.38]Ever?
[73:06.52]I do.
[73:12.84]I think I'm losing you, by the way.
[73:15.66]Is that you?
[73:16.48]That's because the sprint button is LB and the pause button is RB.
[73:20.44]You just sprinted by.
[73:26.71]Wait, did you just sprint by?
[73:27.79]No.
[73:32.15]You're so far behind.
[73:33.57]Listen, hang on.
[73:34.23]Slow down.
[73:34.77]I'm behind you.
[73:36.45]Come over here.
[73:42.88]What's wrong?
[73:44.14]Well, you're not the old lady.
[73:45.64]I am.
[73:46.46]Oh, you are.
[73:50.94]Will you quit screwing around?
[73:54.21]I definitely saw someone.
[73:55.61]I saw somebody, man.
[73:56.45]100%.
[73:56.51]What did you see?
[74:02.68]Remember when those two AIs talked to each other on Twitch that time?
[74:07.06]This is what this is.
[74:07.82]Just Alexa and Google Assistant.
[74:10.56]It was a child.
[74:11.72]Just wait like five seconds before answering.
[74:16.58]A child.
[74:18.54]Now you're really screwing with me.
[74:25.29]I know what I saw.
[74:27.31]Let's just catch up with the others, okay?
[74:29.64]You too.
[74:30.98]Dude, what?
[74:31.76]It's right there.
[74:32.26]What the fuck is that?
[74:40.73]What the hell?
[74:41.99]That was pretty creepy looking.
[74:42.93]I'm not going to lie.
[74:46.57]Did you hear that?
[74:49.07]What on Earth is that?
[74:52.49]Okay.
[74:53.03]Very good.
[74:55.71]We're freaked.
[74:58.39]That's an elaborate weird freaked out who's doing the joke.
[75:01.89]It's like I'm rustling bushes and shining lights, not like in $5,000 of makeup.
[75:05.65]Sounds good.
[75:06.11]Alright, I'll take the right side.
[75:08.10]Alright, we have to stay close to each other.
[75:35.54]Hey, wait for us.
[75:37.62]That was a nice elaborate dance.
[75:38.92]Alright, definitely start walking the other direction instead and just go that way.
[75:45.00]See how far we can go.
[75:51.00]All of a sudden like a Mario Kart wrong way thing starts blinking up there.
[75:55.04]It was probably just a deer.
[75:56.04]This is deer crossing.
[76:01.69]We can actually go pretty far.
[76:04.22]Uh, it's probably gonna loop us around.
[76:08.88]It might.
[76:13.40]Uh.
[76:17.08]Perfect.
[76:18.76]Oh, no.
[76:19.72]Hang on, hang on, hang on.
[76:20.34]Stay close, stay close.
[76:21.04]Where are you?
[76:21.32]Stay close, stay close, stay close.
[76:22.36]Where'd you go?
[76:22.90]Oh, God.
[76:23.88]I already lost you.
[76:24.76]What?
[76:26.21]I already lost you.
[76:27.11]I stood still.
[76:27.71]You walked forward, then backward.
[76:29.79]No, no, no, no, no.
[76:30.87]I'm coming back the other way.
[76:36.15]It's game over.
[76:36.69]Okay, do you see, uh... Andrew?
[76:41.44]Do not go into that real thick stuff.
[76:46.64]Yeah.
[76:46.88]Wait, could you see me the whole time?
[76:48.22]No, no.
[76:49.00]I just, like, walked by you.
[76:57.73]Hey, don't... Stay together.
[76:58.79]Is this just, like, a horror version of PUBG?
[77:01.09]Like, is that the...
[77:03.31]the veil chasing us into the zone?
[77:05.23]Because I don't think we're physically allowed to go any further.
[77:08.31]Actually, I think that actually might be what's happening.
[77:12.11]What is that?
[77:14.83]What is what?
[77:15.27]Wait.
[77:15.43]Something on the ground.
[77:18.63]Alright, you want to pick it up?
[77:20.83]You want me to pick it up?
[77:21.63]You pick it up.
[77:22.23]You probably haven't even looked at one piece of lore the entire game.
[77:24.95]You're right.
[77:25.25]I haven't looked at one single item pretty much the whole game.
[77:27.29]You're right.
[77:28.09]Come and check this out.
[77:29.49]I picked up a newspaper and it was upside down and then we got pulled out of here.
[77:33.21]What on Earth is that?
[77:38.55]Not a clue.
[77:41.73]They were trying to make a campfire and then went into the woods to get some sticks.
[77:43.99]That's what I was gonna say.
[77:46.60]It's a voodoo doll?
[77:49.10]Alright, take the pin out and stab it right in the brain as hard as you can.
[77:53.78]Just immediately, oh, it's a voodoo doll!
[77:56.12]Let's try it!
[77:59.83]Oh, whoa!
[78:05.17]What is your name, sir?
[78:10.35]Uh, Andrew?
[78:14.62]Um, Andrew?
[78:17.56]Andrew?
[78:19.26]My real name's Andrew, but my friends call me Jerma.
[78:22.70]What's your name?
[78:27.10]Who the hell are you?
[78:28.86]Why are you dressed like that?
[78:31.72]I am called Mary.
[78:34.30]Oh, it's Mary.
[78:34.66]I fashioned her with my own hand.
[78:38.59]She looks just like the one beside you.
[78:41.75]Would you kindly come play with me?
[78:43.75]Dogs are fucking ugly.
[78:46.23]Come play.
[78:47.79]Push her into the fire.
[78:48.69]What are we playing?
[78:49.43]Come play with me.
[78:50.21]What witch's trickery is this now, Mary?
[78:52.63]I have done nothing.
[78:53.67]Hold your tongue.
[78:55.07]Oh, wait.
[78:55.53]Wasn't, like, dancing considered, like, witchcraft back in, like, the fucking 1400s?
[78:58.69]Every part of affection for you will be shaken loose when he learns of your infidelity with the devil.
[79:13.34]there's someone else out here by the fire what I I don't see any fire oh I get it I don't I do but I can't I mean I have like three or four theories are we doing theories or are we gonna not how can you not have seen that no theories I couldn't see anything through this impossible impenetrable there's until a halfway point go ahead tell them what we saw
[79:43.28]A little girl appeared out of the fog, and then just like that, she was gone again.
[79:48.71]What is going on?
[79:49.89]Maybe the fog has got you confused.
[79:52.55]We're all stressed out.
[79:53.63]Dude.
[79:55.55]We all agree that the road is an infinite loop.
[79:59.57]Anything is possible.
[80:01.03]Looked exactly like the girl in my dream.
[80:02.83]You're seeing things.
[80:04.92]She talked in this really weird accent.
[80:06.98]Was that even American?
[80:08.72]I'm not sure.
[80:09.36]I couldn't place her accent either.
[80:11.14]What have we gotten ourselves into?
[80:13.47]Yes, it was right Mary did she want to hurt you That ain't no action I ever heard of she could have been maybe malicious I guess I
[80:42.54]She stabbed me.
[80:44.50]She stabbed me.
[80:45.12]She stabbed me with a knife in the arm.
[80:46.34]In the little doll arm.
[80:48.02]What?
[80:48.86]Yeah, that's what happened.
[80:53.02]Get that doll away from her and throw it in the fucking fire.
[80:56.13]That's what I said.
[80:57.55]But wait until it's on a different person but me.
[81:03.17]But there's like a doll for everybody.
[81:05.48]Is there a doll for everybody?
[81:06.92]I don't know.
[81:07.22]There were two dolls there.
[81:08.90]Like one on the ground and one that she was holding.
[81:11.94]Dude, I'm just going to take that doll and I'm going to go rent out a warehouse.
[81:14.99]And I'm going to get a little box in that warehouse.
[81:16.69]And I'm going to have inside the box is going to be perfect 75 degrees.
[81:20.95]Zero humidity.
[81:22.93]Okay, but what happens if you like buy the doll a mansion and like a little RC car, like a really cute one.
[81:29.53]Do you get all that shit in real life?
[81:30.97]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[81:31.67]Update.
[81:31.85]Escalated rather quickly.
[81:35.50]Everything that one does or doesn't do in one's life will catch up with one eventually.
[81:42.10]Don't you think?
[81:45.08]Don't look at me.
[81:46.99]I can't help you.
[81:49.15]Remember?
[81:53.69]We sometimes congratulate ourselves on waking from a troubled dream.
[81:59.07]Maybe so the moment after death.
[82:07.06]on my travels over many years I've witnessed many things seen and heard many beliefs and there's usually some element of truth in each of them these unfortunate folks seem to be dealing with forces as yet unexplained I mean sinister movements in the forest spirits from the past a little girl who may be in trouble
[82:36.27]Or maybe she simply is trouble.
[82:39.95]See, I said that she was malicious.
[82:41.09]That was right.
[82:41.47]Anyway, where are we?
[82:44.25]Angela isn't getting much tittle-tattle out of Taylor.
[82:48.69]Tittle-tattle?
[82:49.97]No, kiss and tell.
[82:53.19]What about John?
[82:55.09]The figure of authority, perhaps?
[82:57.03]Oh, he's a chump.
[82:58.35]Or perhaps he represents something else.
[83:00.81]He's a badass darts player, though, from what I could see.
[83:02.51]And then there's Andrew.
[83:04.90]Somewhat confused, I think.
[83:07.61]A bump to the head can do that.
[83:09.45]Andrew's, you know... Let me reassure you.
[83:11.67]Andrew's alright.
[83:12.83]Who's Andrew?
[83:14.41]Uh, Bandersnatch guy.
[83:15.37]Oh, yeah.
[83:16.79]The mania.
[83:17.61]And some that may turn out to be regrettable.
[83:22.48]That fellow in the bar.
[83:24.12]Ooh, Omega L. He was less than helpful.
[83:26.16]More than a little rude, if you ask me.
[83:29.12]Clearly something disturbing on his mind.
[83:34.96]enough there's something not quite right okay that's pretty good somebody in chat said this is just an annoying dm trying to hype up his players before they get back in the game that's I upvote that guy with all your points hey you guys just coming on Saturday
[83:56.90]Listen, it's going to be an epic campaign, I promise.
[83:58.96]Super into it DM hyping his players up.
[84:02.62]Whoever that guy was, I want that guy VIP'd for five minutes.
[84:06.92]I know it's been unsettling, but we're going to get out of this.
[84:10.70]Unsettling my ass?
[84:11.42]Yeah, we keep switching.
[84:13.10]What went down back there?
[84:17.68]Wait, wait, wait.
[84:19.70]Am I supposed to stay close to you or find help in town?
[84:22.02]Are we splitting up or are we staying together?
[84:24.18]I don't know.
[84:24.82]Maybe, should we tell?
[84:26.50]We shouldn't say.
[84:27.26]Are you following me?
[84:28.10]I'm the old lady again.
[84:29.32]Yeah, it just says keep up with the others.
[84:32.20]I'm the professor.
[84:36.98]Are we going to go knock on this random house?
[84:38.92]I'm just trying to keep everybody in my field of view in case they disappear.
[84:43.26]Or, you know, the game could just rip me on the other side.
[84:48.09]I'm using my phone as a flashlight, but I have not attempted to call anybody in the game yet.
[84:53.64]That shit drains your battery.
[84:55.94]There's something over here.
[84:56.50]Why don't you pick it up?
[84:59.16]Yeah, I'll pick it up.
[85:09.84]I accidentally put it back down without looking at it.
[85:13.72]I was trying to take it out of your hand.
[85:17.92]Okay, so that's just nothing.
[85:19.16]Why are we all over here?
[85:20.02]It's a picture of a skull.
[85:22.08]Ooh, a picture of a skull.
[85:25.94]I'm getting a premonition.
[85:32.15]I think we lost... No, they're just standing here.
[85:34.15]It's just a very morbid postcard.
[85:46.23]I heard something.
[85:47.11]I heard something.
[85:51.98]Yeah.
[85:52.14]Something.
[85:54.44]Okay.
[85:54.88]That's an alligator.
[85:57.44]Oh, alligator POV.
[85:58.32]Alligator POV.
[85:59.02]Look.
[85:59.40]Alright, come over here.
[85:59.88]This is definitely alligator POV.
[86:02.54]He's watching us or something.
[86:09.75]Aww.
[86:11.37]He's standing up on two legs.
[86:13.17]Hahaha.
[86:25.10]POV, you are the alligator.
[86:29.44]Are we all together, right?
[86:30.51]We're good?
[86:31.67]Yeah.
[86:32.25]We're all here.
[86:34.31]Oh, it was just an animal.
[86:35.17]It's just a deer.
[86:35.97]Don't go alone.
[86:58.90]Trinkets.
[87:00.52]What's this trinket?
[87:02.09]Ghost towns of the northeast.
[87:04.81]Who writes this trash?
[87:06.21]I'm not reading this.
[87:07.01]This is fucking too long.
[87:07.87]I don't care.
[87:08.75]Was that you or your character that said who writes this trash?
[87:11.39]I think we both just said it at the same time.
[87:18.87]Okay.
[87:19.77]For all future game developers, let me just tell you.
[87:23.07]If it's longer than a paragraph, I'm not reading it.
[87:27.74]What do you think happened to us back there?
[87:32.82]Go right in the middle of both of them.
[87:34.96]Like as close to the middle as you can.
[87:37.08]Wait, what?
[87:37.54]I'm just sitting here like mouth breathing on you guys having a conversation.
[87:40.62]I feel like we're in danger.
[87:41.70]Yeah, but like try and position yourself right between them.
[87:44.46]Yeah, I hear you.
[87:45.39]Or directly behind me.
[87:46.65]I can't even move.
[87:48.25]What's up?
[87:49.67]You two okay?
[87:50.81]After what we went through back there, we're both a considerable distance from okay.
[88:00.60]I'm sorry I lost touch with you in the fog.
[88:04.42]Shows we need to stick close to each other.
[88:08.60]Let's not turn this into an argument.
[88:10.44]Why do you sound like you're in on it?
[88:12.48]This game is fucking ridiculous.
[88:17.75]Sounds like we need to stick close to each other.
[88:20.63]Oh, Swamp Monster.
[88:29.42]Wait, uh, did we see that?
[88:31.60]No one's... No, we're the only ones who can see anything, apparently.
[88:36.88]Oh.
[88:37.94]Um... The only thing that they've seen so far is the fire and the little girl with the dolls.
[88:44.14]We've seen all the monsters.
[88:46.78]Trixie Hobbitses.
[88:51.38]Yes, yes, yes!
[88:54.04]We're monsters!
[88:55.53]Oh, precious!
[88:56.93]This is two.
[88:57.91]This is four golems.
[89:11.57]Yeah, you just got a double impression.
[89:13.97]That was a two for one.
[89:19.51]Are we going the wrong way?
[89:24.01]Every way is the wrong way in this game.
[89:27.97]Why are you not last hitting?
[89:28.97]Because fuck last hitting.
[89:30.77]It's a stupid mechanic.
[89:31.75]It turns me off of every one of those games.
[89:33.91]Smite's the only one that didn't have it.
[89:35.59]It's the only one that was any fun.
[89:38.63]True.
[89:39.47]Alligator.
[89:44.48]No, no, no, look, look, look, look.
[89:45.64]Do you see?
[89:46.94]I see it, yeah.
[89:47.82]It's someone's ear.
[89:53.36]Heroes of the Storm.
[89:53.95]Heroes of the Storm was alright.
[89:57.69]It was too... Heroes of the Storm was too easy for me, though.
[90:00.89]And no, not like, oh, too easy.
[90:02.31]But like, I like having at least some individuality in those games.
[90:07.03]I have you to share everything in Heroes of the Storm.
[90:08.65]No, I don't want to share everything.
[90:09.89]I want it for me.
[90:10.81]I want to get, like, the boots of fucking justice and shit on my own.
[90:16.60]Is this the newest Strand-type video game?
[90:18.77]Are we delivering a package or walking?
[90:21.21]I don't know.
[90:22.27]You're the one that played that game.
[90:32.51]Little Hope Middle School.
[90:34.01]Uh-oh.
[90:39.42]I don't like last inning.
[90:42.12]Guess we've been demoted from college, guys.
[90:47.05]Amen to that.
[90:48.66]To go teach the middle schoolers.
[90:53.14]Look at that.
[90:54.72]Hey.
[90:55.66]Wait.
[90:56.96]Stop.
[90:57.38]It worked.
[91:02.10]Did you listen?
[91:02.94]Yeah.
[91:03.98]This is exactly what goes down in horror movies.
[91:08.84]Self-referential.
[91:10.32]I'll give it to you.
[91:10.86]What the hell do we do now?
[91:11.70]It's just a little girl.
[91:14.36]What?
[91:16.03]What the hell do we do?
[91:16.95]She's two feet tall and has no muscle structure.
[91:20.03]We could kill her.
[91:21.05]What are you talking about?
[91:22.39]I'm so glad they finally made fear four.
[91:33.18]I'll deal with this.
[91:34.44]What?
[91:35.20]Stay right here.
[91:36.26]Really?
[91:37.00]Alright.
[91:38.26]Time to mute and I'll see you for the next chapter.
[91:43.58]I'll handle this.
[91:45.28]Hey, uh, remember when we took bets on who would die first?
[91:47.50]I think you're just trying to, like, confirm that you were right.
[91:50.50]I'm just stacking the deck.
[91:51.42]You're throwing for that guy.
[91:52.72]Stacking the deck.
[91:54.12]What are you doing?
[91:54.76]Alright, I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm... Hold up.
[91:56.52]I'll come with you.
[91:57.30]No, no, don't kill her.
[91:58.16]I like her.
[91:58.81]We're killing this guy.
[92:01.91]Listen, you gotta live with the consequences, okay?
[92:03.39]I'm not gonna be left behind as a secondary character back here while you go do all the heroic stuff.
[92:07.11]No, no, great.
[92:10.51]Hey, you too.
[92:12.49]We just bachelorette picked these two people to die.
[92:16.45]This is not good.
[92:20.73]Confront the girl.
[92:21.63]Great.
[92:21.97]Alright, you go first.
[92:22.93]No, I go first.
[92:23.61]I want the old lady to live.
[92:30.77]You're the one that decided to go follow them.
[92:33.15]I'm not going to let you pass me.
[92:34.15]This is NASCAR level shit here.
[92:35.49]I'm just going to.
[92:35.85]You're not going to get anyone there.
[92:38.11]It's okay.
[92:38.53]I get the drift.
[92:41.40]Hello?
[92:43.16]Anyone?
[92:43.58]Get off me!
[93:00.03]John!
[93:00.33]Nightcrawler?
[93:00.73]Who are you?
[93:06.81]What are you doing here?
[93:09.55]These are most troubling times.
[93:12.17]Wait.
[93:12.81]Don't go.
[93:13.83]Stay away!
[93:15.17]What?
[93:18.95]You're the one that grabbed us first?
[93:22.43]What the hell are you?
[93:24.35]What do you want?
[93:28.56]It's impossible.
[93:30.48]It's her.
[93:31.28]A black tongue full of riddles.
[93:32.70]I will not succumb to a witch's spell.
[93:36.92]It's her.
[93:37.22]It's you.
[93:37.96]Please, Lord, I beg you.
[93:39.72]Rid me of these apparitions.
[93:41.72]Oh, we're like in each other's worlds.
[93:43.66]We're like the ghosts in their world and they're the ghosts in our world.
[93:46.26]Fuck.
[93:48.00]Okay, that's what I was going to say when you said don't say your theories out loud.
[93:52.14]Where the hell are we?
[93:52.80]You just took credit.
[93:54.28]What have you done?
[93:54.96]I have had my fill of you.
[93:56.35]You didn't say that.
[93:57.05]You just wanted to get in first.
[93:58.91]Yeah, you didn't say that.
[93:59.89]Yeah, you could have jumped in and said that.
[94:06.27]Stolen.
[94:08.91]Let's get into town.
[94:11.09]It's not so far now, and it's our best shot at getting help.
[94:14.95]You guys okay?
[94:16.07]Thanks, man.
[94:18.41]I am very far from okay.
[94:20.63]I am terrified and confused.
[94:22.67]I just saw my own double in the fog.
[94:25.41]What happened in there?
[94:26.69]This woman came out of nowhere in the fog, dressed like an extra from Salem.
[94:30.62]She was garbling something in an accent I didn't recognize, and most disturbing of all, she was the spitting image of me.
[94:37.81]Alright, I'm ready to kill that guy.
[94:39.31]Kill this guy.
[94:39.79]Kill this guy.
[94:40.35]Can we just all agree?
[94:41.69]He was in the dream and he still thinks I'm overreacting.
[94:43.21]Oh no!
[94:43.39]Here comes the quintessential decision.
[94:44.67]Okay.
[94:44.81]Well...
[95:05.61]Don't you kids watch horror movies?
[95:07.83]You never, ever split up.
[95:09.20]Those movies are dumb.
[95:11.46]And I'm going this way.
[95:13.22]Wait, didn't she just say, this is the shit that happens in horror movies?
[95:17.22]Those are dumb.
[95:17.98]Don't believe them.
[95:20.79]I'm with John.
[95:26.77]I'm with John.
[95:28.13]Isn't there another person that we're missing here?
[95:31.19]I'm not going with Taylor.
[95:31.81]But where's the third player?
[95:54.35]Didn't we just agree not to split up?
[95:56.43]We did.
[95:58.13]Alright.
[96:00.97]It's just like horror movies.
[96:07.50]Horror movies are dumb.
[96:09.64]Alright, see you in an hour.
[96:13.80]Etalyx.
[96:14.84]See you in an hour?
[96:15.92]And then his face turns into a fucking ghost.
[96:27.63]Hey, see you in an hour when, um, like two of your characters are dead and all of mine are.
[96:32.89]Hey, who are you?
[96:34.21]I think we split up.
[96:35.56]I'm, um, I'm the, I don't want to say it, but I'm the guy with the, I'm the other, I'm the guy that like, we don't, yeah, the guy that like, who cares, right?
[96:44.20]Like, I'm not connected with Daniel at all.
[96:46.54]I don't know about you, but I have it at all.
[96:48.84]Where's Daniel first?
[96:50.48]So you're doing something else.
[96:51.52]But he has no personality as of yet.
[96:53.72]Alright, so I'll see you in a little bit.
[96:56.34]What's that noise?
[96:57.41]I'm sure it's nothing.
[96:58.25]Alright, we're split up.
[97:02.91]Wonder what closed the school down.
[97:04.31]I thought it was just us two.
[97:08.15]Even if you make it over, there's no way I'm following.
[97:10.97]What?
[97:11.86]I never did like school.
[97:13.72]Let's get out of here.
[97:15.52]Looks like there's no way through.
[97:16.72]I might have made a bad call here.
[97:19.44]Your guy's personality that you gave this guy is... This is not even Daniel to me.
[97:27.54]Don't stress it.
[97:28.88]No one made us come this way.
[97:31.04]We'll find another way.
[97:35.60]Okay, reassuring.
[97:37.40]Let's go.
[97:45.10]Damn, Daniel.
[97:49.50]Find another route out of Little Hope.
[97:52.46]Stick together, follow the little girl.
[97:56.94]Okay, we have to follow the little girl.
[97:58.24]I just read that in chat.
[98:02.72]I forgot that that was even a thing.
[98:04.96]Somebody said it and I read it.
[98:07.68]Remember, I'm the streamer that reads his chat out loud.
[98:10.66]It doesn't matter what it is.
[98:17.72]Another row, okay.
[98:19.38]Search for the little girl.
[98:20.15]This place gives me the creeps big time.
[98:25.01]Don't read this.
[98:26.09]I talked about shoving Smarties somewhere recently.
[98:32.00]I wouldn't say that in a normal circumstance.
[98:35.38]Alright, follow the little girl.
[98:37.18]There she is.
[98:40.06]Over there!
[98:43.98]Go into the tube.
[98:47.98]Hey, are you okay?
[98:54.23]Concerned?
[98:54.61]This... This little girl is the key to all of this.
[98:59.81]Did I... Did I reach?
[99:02.27]I guess I'm... Hey!
[99:24.98]Tell me that didn't just happen.
[99:26.16]Quiet now.
[99:27.22]I will not be caught.
[99:28.90]What are you talking about?
[99:29.74]Get away or he will find me.
[99:33.16]Who's... Who the fuck is this?
[99:38.72]Come on out, Mary.
[99:40.94]I know very well you're in there.
[99:43.04]It's not me.
[99:44.06]Please, no, let me go.
[99:46.96]I will release you once I'm sure you will not speak of our secret.
[99:49.60]The fuck it kind of is.
[99:51.24]Your childish games tire me.
[99:56.53]You will respect me and you will say nothing.
[100:00.45]No!
[100:03.19]Let go of her right now!
[100:09.27]I broke the time... I broke time?
[100:13.19]What?
[100:13.53]What spell have you cast?
[100:15.57]I am frozen to my marrow.
[100:16.71]You do nothing.
[100:17.85]Amy is the caster of spells.
[100:19.25]She is the one in league with the devil.
[100:22.80]I saw her in the forest together with her familiars.
[100:25.62]I am innocent.
[100:26.91]He can't see me.
[100:28.09]I will have the truth one way or another.
[100:31.17]You come with me, girl.
[100:33.51]Thank you kindly.
[100:34.75]Be silent, child.
[100:35.99]Don't say that.
[100:36.77]That means I have to do everything you say.
[100:42.82]Can someone tell me what just happened?
[100:45.44]Those two kids have to be linked somehow.
[100:48.00]No way that's a coincidence.
[100:50.30]I... I don't get it.
[100:53.48]Let's not hang around here.
[100:54.75]It's time to go.
[100:55.39]Alright, yeah, so we're... Only little girl can see us.
[101:00.07]Only the other, like, devil worshippers can see us.
[101:02.15]I got that wrong, probably, but whatever.
[101:03.45]Alright, let's go.
[101:18.36]I'm glad you're here.
[101:19.52]Both of us are getting out of here.
[101:21.38]Oh, I see it in the distance.
[101:26.86]This is literally just the crucible.
[101:37.24]Blowing past the lore.
[101:42.17]I'm sorry.
[101:45.57]I don't read lore.
[101:47.21]I don't read lore.
[101:48.55]Wait, wait.
[101:49.25]Okay, I got it.
[101:49.69]I got it.
[101:50.19]I wasn't looking.
[101:50.65]I got it.
[101:53.94]No, I read Lord of its paragraph and put on the screen in front of me.
[101:56.92]I don't pick up newspapers and read it.
[101:58.71]Don't worry.
[101:59.81]Etalyx reads all that shit.
[102:00.85]He'll tell us.
[102:09.17]I don't think this takes us out of this shitty town.
[102:13.32]There's no road.
[102:16.12]Must lead somewhere, though.
[102:18.12]I'm not so sure.
[102:18.74]There's barely even a path.
[102:21.41]Just blowing by every item.
[102:23.84]But I'm not, though.
[102:25.18]If it's shiny, I click it.
[102:26.22]See?
[102:26.30]Here.
[102:26.42]This is less than a paragraph.
[102:27.36]No, it's not.
[102:42.34]This is how I read lore anyways.
[102:44.06]This is how I do it anyways.
[103:17.36]Leave me alone.
[103:19.16]Oh, we tried the door.
[103:25.02]Talek's already figured out how to upgrade his town hall in the game.
[103:31.52]Yeah, but what he doesn't know is I'm sending 200 peasants through the back door to start attacking his town hall.
[103:38.20]And it's a stupid, shitty thing to do, but that's what I'm doing.
[103:42.42]What am I doing?
[103:44.06]This is the slowest selfie I've ever taken.
[103:46.16]Oh, what?
[103:46.55]That's got 20 community subs.
[103:54.75]Unionize your workplace.
[103:55.69]Thanks for the 20 subs.
[103:56.91]That's a lot of money.
[104:01.50]Thanks.
[104:01.94]Really.
[104:03.08]20 subs.
[104:07.02]What are you doing?
[104:08.58]There's no food in here.
[104:09.94]Help me push this, will you?
[104:11.37]I'm surprised at what people throw away these days.
[104:12.83]Seriously?
[104:13.84]There's no other way.
[104:17.24]I've got no choice.
[104:20.16]Isn't this on wheels?
[104:22.06]Why would it be this heavy?
[104:22.82]Let me see if I can get this open.
[104:45.31]Okay, I saw everybody say, dude, things can be heavy.
[104:48.14]What's up with that?
[104:49.30]Why is that that heavy?
[104:57.14]Seriously?
[104:58.32]You're going in there?
[105:00.86]If I go in first, I don't want to be the character that dies first.
[105:03.49]Do you have any better ideas?
[105:06.11]Do you have a better suggestion?
[105:08.11]Sure.
[105:09.05]Don't go into an old, dark, creepy-ass building after the night we've had.
[105:15.56]Don't worry, I'll be right back.
[105:17.54]And then I never show up again.
[105:21.22]He's talking to us.
[105:23.02]This is some Dora the Explorer shit.
[105:29.41]And remember, chat, if you see anything weird, make sure you point it out for me before I get scared.
[105:34.15]Do you see anything scary in here?
[105:44.30]It's like a fucking ghoul behind him with like a fucking pitchfork.
[105:47.68]It's right there!
[105:49.42]It's right there!
[105:50.88]You see something?
[105:52.60]What do you see?
[105:53.68]It's a ghoul!
[105:54.72]It's a ghoul!
[105:55.98]And the fucking pitchfork goes through his chest.
[105:58.40]Oh, this is great.
[106:19.84]Go in.
[106:21.20]Go in, dude!
[106:26.14]What was up there?
[106:26.68]Oh, there we go.
[106:30.10]Brown beef, 249.
[106:30.72]Pretty cool.
[106:31.12]Alright, so I have to let her in a different way.
[106:39.55]What just happened?
[106:43.51]I have no idea what just happened!
[106:49.65]Like stepped on a nail.
[106:54.58]Hello?
[106:56.60]Who's there?
[106:59.24]Oh, don't worry.
[106:59.84]It's just us.
[107:05.86]Hey!
[107:06.40]Can't get through.
[107:11.15]This window is all boarded up.
[107:16.07]Scared me.
[107:16.55]You gave me a shock.
[107:18.63]Sorry, I didn't mean to spook you.
[107:20.31]Why would that bring the relationship down?
[107:24.85]How is it in there?
[107:25.53]Oh, rats.
[107:29.13]I got company of the rodent variety.
[107:32.09]Gross.
[107:34.83]Kill her.
[107:35.13]Relax.
[107:35.63]Kill her first.
[107:36.15]I changed my mind.
[107:37.99]Head to the front.
[107:39.09]I'll meet you there.
[107:40.33]Sure thing.
[107:51.16]This is super creepy.
[107:56.65]That's not her this time.
[108:00.01]That's somebody else.
[108:04.03]It's not gonna be her.
[108:05.96]It's gonna be a scary ghoul.
[108:07.38]Okay.
[108:08.56]Okay.
[108:09.00]Okay.
[108:28.03]Get off me.
[108:30.23]Wait, that's Angela?
[108:35.42]The back door is locked.
[108:37.06]What troubles you?
[108:39.26]Tell me.
[108:40.38]What is happening?
[108:41.28]Sona will come for me.
[108:42.92]Calm yourself, wife.
[108:44.66]Who is coming for you?
[108:45.60]They're talking about me.
[108:48.11]There are accusations.
[108:49.69]Accusations of what sort?
[108:52.15]They talk that I'm in league with the devil, that I'm guilty of witchcraft.
[108:56.52]There's no sense in that.
[108:58.40]Who would say such a thing?
[109:01.84]I cannot rightly say it.
[109:04.08]Dude, this is such a mindfuck.
[109:08.04]Leave or confront?
[109:09.52]Leave or confront?
[109:13.46]Etalyx found a secret.
[109:14.58]I gotta one-up him.
[109:15.84]Confront.
[109:19.10]Stay where you are.
[109:19.86]I gotta hide a secret.
[109:21.19]Just tell me what's happening.
[109:22.97]How did I get here?
[109:24.90]Oh, shit.
[109:25.36]What rumors?
[109:26.32]I don't know anything.
[109:28.42]What are you talking about?
[109:29.26]What's a witch?
[109:29.62]Uh, okay.
[109:29.82]I saw a girl.
[109:32.06]Uh, she was, um, she was with this priest.
[109:52.86]The girl, she... she was with this priest.
[109:57.53]Reverend Carver?
[109:58.97]The one now beating on our door?
[110:00.85]No, he's the devil.
[110:02.49]Mary.
[110:04.51]Come now, Mary.
[110:07.47]Mary?
[110:09.11]Mary saw me in the woods a day or so back.
[110:11.26]I was about my daily business, nothing more.
[110:13.68]He's got another secret.
[110:14.90]There is more to this.
[110:16.20]I gotta start strangling somebody.
[110:17.78]Mary does not like me chiding her.
[110:19.56]Perhaps she's spoken out against me.
[110:21.24]She has a temper.
[110:23.95]You suggest the room was a Mary's doing.
[110:26.73]She's a troubled child for sure, but this is beyond her.
[110:31.10]Joseph, this ends badly if you do not open up.
[110:33.16]Finding all these secrets.
[110:35.86]What plan do we have?
[110:36.66]Alright, I'll kick his ass.
[110:38.68]My word on it.
[110:40.22]Do not admit them.
[110:42.32]Reverend Carver.
[110:44.32]Marshal.
[110:44.62]They didn't have guns back in the day here.
[110:46.42]I have here a legally written warrant.
[110:47.48]Just pick up a bottle and hit him in the head.
[110:51.94]My wife has done nothing wrong.
[110:54.62]There is a witness to your wife speaking in tongues.
[110:56.88]They did?
[110:57.30]Yeah, but you could only shoot once in like an hour.
[110:59.12]He'll miss.
[111:00.48]Just dodge it and hit him in the head with a fucking wrench.
[111:02.14]The word of a child condemns my wife.
[111:05.71]You will deliver yourself into the Marshal's hands for your own good.
[111:09.45]Then I must accompany her.
[111:11.25]She will not leave my sight.
[111:13.37]Such action will not aid your wife's cause.
[111:16.85]Trust in justice.
[111:19.25]Do not fear.
[111:20.53]I will find a way to resolve this.
[111:24.26]Am I still here?
[111:25.26]Oh.
[111:28.52]How come they didn't ask me anything about like my clothes and stuff?
[111:36.41]Wouldn't they be freaked out by my clothes?
[111:41.04]It's been weeks.
[111:51.51]You look freaked.
[111:52.31]What's up?
[111:53.83]You saw something else, right?
[112:06.42]Alright.
[112:08.96]Let's tell the truth.
[112:09.64]This was different.
[112:11.54]I think they could see and hear me.
[112:15.38]It was hard to tell exactly.
[112:17.14]They seemed really spooked.
[112:19.38]You see anything else?
[112:21.49]Uh, okay.
[112:21.97]Talk about the woman getting arrested, that's important.
[112:26.83]Everyone needs to know that detail.
[112:27.73]Mmm.
[112:27.89]Yes.
[112:46.43]We've really screwed up here.
[112:47.79]Instead of getting out of this awful place, we're right back in the middle of town.
[112:51.07]Alright, catch up with the other group.
[112:59.82]Can we just tell Etalyx that I killed like eight people?
[113:02.92]Let's tell Etalyx that my gameplay was fucking crazy.
[113:15.17]Let's make him jealous that he didn't get to play this part of the game.
[113:20.57]Dude, I was in a fight.
[113:22.11]There was two demons that had wings.
[113:25.25]I was inside of this cabin that was on fire.
[113:26.55]I hit a guy in the head with a board.
[113:27.61]I did a backflip.
[113:31.65]The character just did a fucking backflip for no reason.
[113:33.91]Just, it was cool.
[113:35.61]Wait, did I?
[113:36.37]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[113:37.19]Where is she?
[113:37.49]Where is she?
[113:37.77]Where is she?
[113:40.03]That face.
[113:41.15]Where?
[113:42.79]Okay, good, we're good, we're good.
[113:43.85]We're fine, we're fine.
[113:50.13]What are you doing?
[113:50.95]I just realized this is literally the movie Hocus Pocus, isn't it?
[114:01.56]You know, I don't... Is it?
[114:12.16]No, isn't Hocus Pocus... Don't they like hypnotize the town or something?
[114:21.52]Like the candy or something?
[114:25.44]No.
[114:26.24]What the fuck?
[114:27.20]Okay.
[114:27.90]That just scared the shit out of me.
[114:28.72]I wasn't even looking.
[114:30.90]It was like such an overreaction too.
[114:32.52]Sorry, I like fucking YouTuber Andy'd that.
[114:42.59]There's a gas station.
[114:43.19]Should we go in the gas station?
[114:47.21]Stop saying Andy.
[114:48.33]I can't- You guys have burned it into my brain.
[114:51.77]Wait, we were already here.
[114:52.65]I have to catch up with the others.
[115:12.01]How do I catch up with the others if I don't know where the others are?
[115:21.64]Etalyx got akimbo pistols.
[115:23.46]Omega lul.
[115:28.14]Oh, hey.
[115:28.90]Hey, Etalyx is on knife, dude.
[115:31.36]You're still on the third pistol.
[115:33.63]Yeah, whatever.
[115:34.05]I don't fucking care.
[115:34.69]Alright.
[115:39.53]I'm just gonna keep walking through the mist?
[115:42.65]Wait, what's that?
[115:45.50]A button.
[115:47.64]Press that button.
[115:50.44]Press the button.
[115:53.46]Press it!
[115:59.86]I can't press this button?
[116:03.57]Why not?
[116:11.29]No, go the- Oh my god, damn it.
[116:21.58]Wait.
[116:23.06]Oh!
[116:25.27]I think I found it.
[116:25.73]Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what was that?
[116:28.41]What was that?
[116:28.69]What was that?
[116:28.99]What was that?
[116:29.53]Someone just walked by me.
[116:32.65]I, this stupid smog shit.
[116:34.68]I'm trying to go to that house.
[116:40.58]Where's that house?
[116:50.39]Okay, I'm gonna go to that, that, I think that's where he is.
[116:52.57]I think he's in the house.
[116:55.18]It's teleporting me around.
[116:56.22]Alright, hold on.
[116:59.48]This is... What am I doing?
[117:08.22]What the fuck is going on?
[117:16.98]Am I in limbo?
[117:23.74]Oh, alright.
[117:24.66]We walk around.
[117:25.54]There's a house, though.
[117:28.88]Should I go back in the gas station?
[117:36.12]No, I was already... No, this is not even... Get the fuck out of here, man.
[117:42.95]Go catch up with the others.
[117:44.89]I gotta go in this house.
[117:47.71]Walk the other way, dickhead.
[117:48.93]Is that what's going on?
[117:55.34]Am I just in the lobby waiting for, like, Etalyx to do a cutscene?
[118:11.52]Wrong way.
[118:12.74]There is no wrong way.
[118:13.50]We keep porting.
[118:23.51]Alright, I'm walking straight and I'm going to go in that house.
[118:31.47]Go in the gas station.
[118:34.33]You went every direction except the right one.
[118:36.02]I tried to go to the house, but the game teleported me.
[118:39.54]Jermis faking tasks.
[118:40.82]He's sus.
[118:43.20]I'm not going to ban that person, but just pretend I did.
[118:49.13]Alright, here we go.
[118:51.05]There's a house over here.
[118:52.69]Just stay on the road.
[118:58.66]Where's that house?
[118:59.94]Right here.
[119:00.44]This is what I... Okay.
[119:02.54]Do you understand?
[119:03.34]Do you see what just happened?
[119:05.19]Do you see what just happened?
[119:07.41]I just tried to go to the house and it turned into the general store.
[119:14.29]There is no house.
[119:15.10]There is!
[119:27.50]What?
[119:27.66]That's where I wanted to go!
[119:29.40]That's where I wanted to go.
[119:30.46]I was trying to go here.
[119:30.98]You saw that.
[119:31.62]Jeremy, don't be so mad.
[119:34.68]My mom is watching.
[119:35.08]She's getting scared.
[119:56.11]Hey.
[119:56.64]Nice jump cut.
[120:02.58]No, but you know how we say here.
[120:04.08]Broccoli is delicious.
[120:04.94]You should eat it every meal.
[120:06.50]Spinach.
[120:07.48]Get good grades in school.
[120:09.34]And go to bed before 9 p.m.
[120:15.31]That's what we do here on Jeremiah 985.
[120:19.13]Kid-friendly.
[120:29.59]Is he not answering the door, or what?
[120:32.41]Really?
[120:33.49]Come on.
[120:33.95]One.
[120:35.03]We can't open it, you can't open it?
[120:39.23]I'm not letting you in.
[120:41.07]Dude, I was walking around in a circle for like 15 minutes.
[120:57.22]Let's try again.
[120:58.78]Put everything you've got into it.
[121:00.84]No.
[121:02.20]Keep them out.
[121:03.42]They're gonna result in an untimely demise.
[121:06.30]Let me in.
[121:07.47]That's worse than doing nothing.
[121:09.23]Get out of my way.
[121:10.23]I'll show you.
[121:12.99]Are you guys pushing?
[121:14.35]You guys have to pull and we have to push.
[121:15.89]Not we both push.
[121:17.73]Yeah, but I wasn't doing the QT, so I just wanted to keep you out.
[121:21.05]Oh, he's fucking out.
[121:22.61]Nah, big fat nothing back there.
[121:25.36]Just a pile of junk.
[121:27.05]Still think splitting up was a smart move?
[121:29.81]I would say I'm now more open to exploring other options.
[121:34.11]I'm glad you two are finding this funny.
[121:35.53]Thank God she's still alive.
[121:36.33]Personally, I think we're in deep shit here.
[121:38.32]I kept everyone alive.
[121:39.46]Thank God you did.
[121:40.40]So did I. Is everyone... Did you?
[121:41.76]Daniel looks dead.
[121:45.26]I got info.
[121:45.96]You might have info.
[121:46.54]Not just accused.
[121:48.08]Tried, found guilty, and condemned.
[121:51.86]We need to know what that woman is facing.
[121:54.14]What's going to happen to her next?
[121:56.94]I like the idea.
[121:58.40]But how would we even begin to find that out?
[122:03.57]We've already been down those paths.
[122:06.01]Maybe the answer lies down the one path we haven't taken yet.
[122:09.93]Any direction we go, the lore ghosts will find us.
[122:12.74]Yeah.
[122:12.92]What the hell?
[122:13.76]They just reach out and grab you when it's time for the lore.
[122:16.00]By the way, this is one of those dumb horror movies that... Honey, it's 7 p.m.
[122:19.64]It's time for your lore.
[122:22.80]It's time... Is that a...
[122:27.03]This is going to be one of those horror movies where everybody dies in the last 10 minutes and the whole entire movie is a boring shitty movie.
[122:41.48]I don't have an answer to that.
[122:43.52]None of us do.
[122:45.26]I must not let fear stop me from doing whatever I can to help.
[122:48.92]Not making that mistake again.
[122:50.38]This game's been crashing over and over for some people.
[122:53.00]Well, thankfully that's not happening to us besides the pause.
[122:55.20]Shut up!
[122:55.62]Why did you say that?
[122:57.63]Now it's going to happen.
[122:58.64]No, it's not.
[122:58.92]It's been two hours.
[122:59.62]That's enough.
[123:00.90]Dude, Watch Dogs Legion crashed like eight times in an hour and ten minutes yesterday.
[123:04.78]It's already crashed.
[123:06.34]No, no.
[123:06.74]For me, like twice.
[123:07.84]We had a pause problem.
[123:08.80]We didn't have a crash.
[123:09.34]We had a pause problem.
[123:10.44]Yeah, but I had to restart the game.
[123:15.81]I'm not even sure anybody can even die by this point anyways.
[123:17.75]Alright, I'm Andrew.
[123:26.19]I am John.
[123:28.24]Back on the old road.
[123:31.11]Lead your students towards the stick together.
[123:36.90]Go to the stick together.
[123:38.72]I guess that's what we're doing.
[123:44.76]So we're going backwards from that to back across the bridge?
[123:48.87]We're going back across the bridge.
[123:52.53]I had to fight like three demons.
[123:53.95]It was fucking awesome.
[123:55.69]The only cool part of the game so far was like hitting the demon in the head with the 2x4.
[124:00.69]I actually found a computer and it did the Until Dawn PC port.
[124:05.51]So I was just kind of playing that while I was waiting for you.
[124:07.19]That game was good.
[124:09.69]I can't see for shit.
[124:16.26]That was not.
[124:19.36]Yeah, it was.
[124:19.96]It was alright.
[124:21.91]It was pretty good.
[124:26.57]Push.
[124:31.43]Did you get any cool action sequences?
[124:32.82]I had a couple that were pretty crazy.
[124:35.51]I hit a demon in the head with a 2x4.
[124:38.88]I found the phone.
[124:39.68]One of the characters tried to fly off the roof and landed like right on the neck.
[124:44.76]It was fucking brutal.
[124:46.32]Did you see anything like that?
[124:49.63]I went bowling.
[124:52.13]Turns out John is not only a god of darts, but also just like other kind of fringe options.
[125:03.56]What was that little smile?
[125:04.36]That was weird.
[125:07.69]Why do you have a Harry Potter scar?
[125:12.08]I'll go first.
[125:16.52]I could have made Angela go first.
[125:18.20]I'll just have you know.
[125:19.48]So if I die here, um... It was for a good cause.
[125:22.92]Somebody's gonna fall in.
[125:24.25]It's... I mean, just who is it gonna be?
[125:25.81]I don't know.
[125:26.67]Are you John?
[125:27.57]Yeah.
[125:28.87]I'm Andrew.
[125:30.01]Well, that means that, uh... Karen's dead.
[125:34.45]Why would we all go at the same time?
[125:41.91]No, they're fading away.
[125:42.89]Oh, look at that crow.
[125:46.49]That be the crow?
[125:47.01]I love crows.
[125:47.83]I thought that was the crow.
[126:11.00]In this year of our Lord, 1692, we are here present to bear witness to a just execution.
[126:17.84]It's the same trick every time, yeah.
[126:20.30]It's the fucking... Oh, my arm!
[126:21.61]You grabbed my wrist and pulled me into another dimension!
[126:25.21]You can grab it by the neck next time.
[126:28.67]I've done no wrong.
[126:30.63]I am no witch.
[126:32.56]I do not deserve death.
[126:34.88]I beg you.
[126:44.16]What'd you say?
[126:44.64]What'd you say?
[126:45.04]What'd you do?
[126:45.56]I didn't say anything.
[126:46.22]What?
[126:46.40]What do you mean you didn't say anything?
[126:48.22]Why not?
[126:48.60]Because I got information that you don't.
[126:51.26]What the fuck?
[126:52.02]The devil is in the wind, seeking to help his own.
[126:55.22]He would release her from the chains.
[126:57.26]Isaac, let us conclude our business here swiftly.
[127:00.40]The will of the court must be imposed before it's too late.
[127:04.38]The devil fortifies her.
[127:06.56]You must bind her tightly.
[127:11.42]They're gonna throw her into the ocean.
[127:17.76]You cannot do this.
[127:19.46]Isaac.
[127:19.94]I am innocent.
[127:20.40]Fulfill the will of the court.
[127:21.22]Help me.
[127:22.02]Send this witch back into the lap of her master, lest he come for us all.
[127:25.89]Little hope is already lost, shrouded in evil.
[127:28.61]But not as you claim from witchcraft or outside demons.
[127:31.37]We are poisoned from within.
[127:32.67]You will not save yourself with riddles.
[127:36.01]There is no riddle.
[127:37.77]The devil takes many forms.
[127:39.41]You know that better than any.
[127:41.89]In little hope, he has hid himself under a shroud of innocence.
[127:44.67]Little girl.
[127:45.45]Taken to the form of a child by an accuser.
[127:48.97]While Mary still draws breath, little hope remains beyond salvation.
[127:53.61]There lies your evil reference in your very face.
[127:58.97]Isaac.
[128:02.00]No!
[128:06.12]No!
[128:11.30]I could get out of that.
[128:14.48]I could get out of that, I think.
[128:15.58]I could.
[128:18.02]Why does she drown instantly?
[128:19.08]I could... You know what I mean?
[128:33.82]Alright, well, did it happen?
[128:36.30]Where were you?
[128:37.44]Where were you?
[128:37.83]I was watching the person die.
[128:41.41]What person die?
[128:43.32]Her.
[128:44.10]You mean this lady?
[128:46.12]What did you see?
[128:47.02]Tell me.
[128:51.22]What did you see?
[128:52.00]What did you see?
[128:52.72]Uh, what did you see?
[128:54.98]What did you see?
[128:55.58]I'm not exactly sure.
[128:57.13]Another vision, I guess?
[128:58.75]I saw, okay.
[128:59.61]An illusion like before?
[129:00.75]She was tied up in a bunch of chains and they threw her in the ocean.
[129:04.03]Yeah, that's what I said.
[129:05.41]I watched the person die.
[129:06.85]Yeah, and I said, I watched her die and you said, who?
[129:09.38]And then I was like, wait, what do you mean?
[129:10.32]No, that's not what we, you asked me who.
[129:12.40]Yeah, and then you didn't say.
[129:13.88]We saw what happened to the woman.
[129:15.29]Yeah, because you were like, I don't think I should tell you.
[129:17.29]Well, because it sounded like you had seen a different cutscene because you didn't know that someone just died.
[129:23.41]So she was killed.
[129:25.15]She's dead.
[129:25.91]You're gaslighting.
[129:28.21]What does that mean for me?
[129:33.57]Wait, that's her.
[129:37.15]I'm accidentally gaslighting because the last game had us confused.
[129:43.38]Sorry, I'm accidentally gaslighting.
[129:45.82]Okay, so the reason I didn't say anything is because when I was separated from you, talking to them was bad.
[129:59.02]Oh, okay.
[130:01.22]But it may not be, apparently, because she died anyway.
[130:04.63]I gaslit myself.
[130:08.15]Oh, whoops.
[130:20.98]Alright, does it count as a character death if the character from like 300 years ago died?
[130:25.66]Because like wouldn't they be dead anyways because it's been 300 years?
[130:28.68]I don't think that counts.
[130:30.14]Well, but I think they come and claim the life of their other half.
[130:34.44]Like right now.
[130:35.68]What the hell is that?
[130:36.16]That's what's going to happen.
[130:37.78]She's going to pop out of the water.
[130:38.54]Andrew's the one who could talk, not Amy.
[130:40.82]What is that thing?
[130:43.88]It's you.
[130:44.20]Get away from it!
[130:50.51]We're gonna go.
[130:52.53]Look out!
[130:54.35]Shit.
[130:56.02]Don't leave me behind!
[130:57.98]Save her.
[130:58.76]Hey!
[130:59.66]Give me a hand here!
[131:02.50]Hold on, hold on.
[131:08.47]I'm coming back for you, John.
[131:10.01]John?
[131:10.33]Hold on.
[131:11.41]Reach up and grab my hand.
[131:12.73]You made the right choice.
[131:13.97]I made the right choice.
[131:14.95]Jump up and grab onto me.
[131:19.69]What are you doing?
[131:20.31]You're not up to this.
[131:22.05]Never mind, I'll get myself up.
[131:23.07]Are you serious right now?
[131:24.48]Okay.
[131:25.28]Let me help John and I'll be right back.
[131:27.84]Why would you do that?
[131:30.64]Habitats!
[131:37.46]Jump!
[131:47.12]Don't worry, I'm gonna be fine.
[131:51.59]What?
[131:53.49]What button am I pressing?
[131:54.95]What's the wrong button?
[131:56.23]I'm clicking, I'm clicking, I'm clicking.
[131:58.07]Don't click.
[132:00.25]What button am I supposed to press?
[132:02.69]Take my hand.
[132:04.35]Take my hand.
[132:05.11]No!
[132:05.25]I have another chance to escape.
[132:16.00]Do you know take my hand put your hand out and help me I I'm just watching Abrasive dismissive derisive.
[132:35.57]Oh Did I do that
[132:42.74]I may have made those things.
[132:44.98]Oh, you did those things.
[132:46.34]Well, you did them too.
[132:47.30]Okay, so when it was telling me to jump, what button was I supposed to press?
[132:54.10]I was left clicking when the timer was going down.
[133:02.14]I had to click on the button.
[133:04.87]So remember how you said you made the right choice when I chose to save that character first and then you refused to take my hand when I came to get you?
[133:13.50]I tried to reach for your hand, but I pressed the wrong button.
[133:15.20]We need to get out of here right now.
[133:17.98]I thought it was just click.
[133:18.90]I didn't know I had to click in the circle.
[133:21.42]I guess I screwed it up.
[133:22.70]Hey, so it turns out if you play with a controller, it just tells you which button to press, and you just push that button.
[133:27.52]Yeah, the game is fucking broken code.
[133:31.06]That's the person I liked the most, too, and I just killed him.
[133:35.23]You just threw on purpose.
[133:36.55]I swear to God!
[133:37.85]You have suffered a loss.
[133:40.17]That was terrible, but...
[133:42.70]I didn't even know how to click inside the circle.
[133:44.70]That was terrible but avoidable.
[133:46.38]You're getting backseated from this chat member now.
[133:48.70]Yeah, what does this fucking guy know?
[133:50.86]Nothing.
[133:51.16]Literally pretending.
[133:52.47]I'm clicking.
[133:53.55]Fuck you, Jerma.
[133:54.31]You gas litter.
[134:18.66]Gas litter The boys have some interesting theories Maybe you're choosing to believe Daniel's theory that they're already dead My dream was lengthened after life and
[134:35.74]Oh, then began the tempest to my soul.
[134:39.02]I passed me thought the melancholy flood with that sour ferryman.
[134:44.69]Gaslighting himself, that's so cool.
[134:47.49]Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
[134:52.41]It's possible, I suppose.
[134:54.63]Maybe the bus driver can shed some light.
[134:59.32]This must be very confusing for you right now.
[135:03.38]doppelgangers, witches, ghosts, death, and demons?
[135:09.12]What could possibly tie all of these souls together?
[135:13.98]I dare say we'll find out.
[135:18.30]I have been granted permission to give you a single hint.
[135:23.48]What?
[135:24.58]Tempted.
[135:25.04]Are you seeing this too?
[135:27.22]Do you want a hint?
[135:29.60]Do you want a hint?
[135:30.06]Yes or no?
[135:30.86]No, no hints.
[135:33.83]Oh, were we not supposed to discuss that?
[135:39.11]I guess we were not supposed to discuss.
[135:43.53]I don't think it matters.
[135:45.37]We're just smarter than the game.
[135:46.33]We figured out VoIP.
[135:50.67]This is the only co-op game series that you're not allowed to talk to the person you're playing with.
[136:03.94]You killed the best character.
[136:05.90]You knew that was my favorite character.
[136:08.71]If I could have saved Judy, I would have.
[136:10.89]Wait!
[136:12.47]Sorry, I was literally pretending.
[136:13.95]Alright, well, it's time for a new favorite character.
[136:15.75]She's gone.
[136:16.57]My new favorite character is... Oh, the rest of them suck.
[136:20.07]I don't like the rest of this game.
[136:20.90]Hey, what did that thing do to her?
[136:21.98]That was deleted.
[136:23.14]Well, you're Andrew now.
[136:24.42]I'm John.
[136:24.78]Oh, great.
[136:30.34]That creature was in chains.
[136:33.80]Just like the woman pushed into the river.
[136:40.68]Fuck.
[136:42.07]Breathe.
[136:43.37]Don't beat yourself up.
[136:44.69]Fuck.
[136:47.75]I love how I'm... You had the decision last time and I'm saying I tried to help her but I sabotaged myself as that character.
[136:55.81]The bank was too steep and I...
[136:58.26]You made the right decision as Andrew.
[137:01.53]You did everything you could.
[137:03.93]It's just you and me now.
[137:06.33]Until Taylor and Daniel get to us.
[137:07.81]Oh, by the way, you weren't paying attention, but since you're Andrew now, you have a gun.
[137:11.31]I've got a gun?
[137:13.17]Yeah, you've got a gun.
[137:14.42]I got the gun, and they're not going to even let me use it, because you've got it.
[137:19.40]So, they took that away from me.
[137:22.02]It's mine now.
[137:22.76]Don't worry, I just gave it to you.
[137:29.03]What?
[137:29.29]Did you?
[137:30.47]No.
[137:31.89]You gave me a flashlight.
[137:35.68]Find a route through the graveyard.
[137:36.92]Alright, are we good?
[137:43.32]He's gonna shoot.
[137:44.22]I'm actually mad.
[137:45.64]He's gonna shoot himself with the gun on purpose.
[137:48.20]No, I'm not gonna do that!
[137:53.99]I'm not gonna shoot myself with the gun!
[138:02.98]Okay, if I shoot myself with the gun, I will give a thousand community subs.
[138:08.99]If I actively shoot myself with the gun, me, and not a cutscene, not like, oh, I can't control it.
[138:16.57]Like, if I put the gun up to my head and pull the trigger and shoot myself in the head, I'll give a thousand community subs.
[138:26.76]Where are you?
[138:30.16]I'm reading tombstones.
[138:35.89]I gotta make that really clear again.
[138:37.39]Not like... If I do that in the game in a cutscene... That's not me.
[138:42.37]I have to right-click, hold gun to head, blow, shoot head.
[138:46.35]Okay?
[138:47.25]That's how this works.
[138:52.88]That's very important distinction.
[138:55.76]Because I swear to God, if there's a cutscene where this character shoots himself in the head, I'm gonna be really mad because that's not what I was saying.
[139:03.37]Here lies the body of Abraham Alastor.
[139:05.45]Oh.
[139:06.65]Are you coming?
[139:10.31]Yoink.
[139:13.49]Hey, thanks for pulling me.
[139:23.70]See, the character's still alive.
[139:27.78]like she just comes up and like stands next to him like hey guys let's stay away from that bridge I want to play as her again even in this picture Daniel and Taylor would be thinking the same thing out of sight quick
[140:04.44]My heartbeat is very irregular right now.
[140:09.03]Oh, it's him.
[140:10.15]Yeah, it's bike guy again.
[140:11.31]This is the second time I've seen him.
[140:18.37]But we always hide from him.
[140:22.86]Why wouldn't we just flag this guy down and say, hey, you remember us, right?
[140:27.16]That woman's final words keep buzzing in my head.
[140:35.44]To end what's happening in Little Hope, the little girl has to be stopped.
[140:40.74]Was she talking about stopping more witchcraft accusations or something else?
[140:45.71]No, about not missing QTEs on purpose.
[140:48.65]Come on.
[140:49.41]Make your chat angry at you, deliberately.
[140:54.43]Wait, did you just confess to a Twitch crime?
[141:00.57]I'll go in and take a look around.
[141:07.50]Oh, shit.
[141:12.54]It's funny that Jerma thinks he's funny.
[141:13.90]As far as walking sticks go, I feel like the pointed edge is probably not for you.
[141:16.76]Alright, VIP that guy for a minute.
[141:22.90]I can't believe Angela's gone.
[141:25.02]I mean, what the fuck?
[141:28.05]It's tough for sure, but tougher on you.
[141:34.51]You two are pretty tight.
[141:37.94]Oh, we split up again?
[141:41.36]No.
[141:42.16]Oh, wait.
[141:42.38]This is me and you.
[141:43.88]I couldn't do this without you.
[141:49.12]Listen, Jeremiah.
[141:51.10]Don't let go.
[141:51.94]Don't let go.
[141:52.28]I'm here for you.
[141:54.00]Don't let go.
[141:55.19]Just do nothing and stay here.
[142:01.79]Synchronized.
[142:06.64]What's that?
[142:08.40]Nothing, probably.
[142:09.52]I heard something.
[142:11.76]Make this moment last forever.
[142:13.66]Hey, I found the witches.
[142:16.12]They're this way.
[142:17.10]Let me read that sign.
[142:18.74]What's that sign say?
[142:19.62]Witch trial.
[142:21.35]It's witch trail.
[142:23.25]Witch trail.
[142:25.29]Yeah, that'd be kind of weird.
[142:27.61]This way for the witch trial.
[142:32.57]It's still weird because it's witch trail.
[142:35.70]Yeah, it's somebody thinks they're funny.
[142:39.62]I don't like this.
[142:40.38]I want to go another way.
[142:41.32]Is it you?
[142:42.16]Don't think there is another way.
[142:47.33]He can't climb and he can't read.
[142:55.65]Quite the tourist trail.
[142:57.72]Not a place I want to revisit.
[142:59.34]You found a secret.
[142:59.98]Yeah, it's just a map.
[143:03.86]The secret map.
[143:07.95]Massacre Memorial.
[143:10.19]Yeah, what the hell is that?
[143:11.99]There's also a buffet.
[143:13.65]Irma, you're a giggle puss today.
[143:14.98]Yeah, I am very giggly today.
[143:16.48]Buffet number one.
[143:16.86]I'm having fun.
[143:18.14]I get very giggly when I have fun.
[143:27.61]Is this the first time you've controlled, Taylor?
[143:30.75]Um... First or second?
[143:38.92]Hey, over here.
[143:40.96]You gotta check this out.
[143:43.23]Bridge.
[143:43.71]It's gonna fall.
[143:46.59]That is what bridges do.
[143:48.31]That thing could still be around here.
[143:50.77]In the water.
[143:51.33]Hey, remember when you said alligator POV?
[143:53.11]Oh, we left that thing way behind.
[143:54.47]I did?
[143:56.27]Was it there?
[143:58.52]Did you get an alligator POV?
[143:59.40]If an alligator was gonna show up... Oh, shit.
[144:01.82]There it was.
[144:02.58]You're going first, right?
[144:03.90]You weigh half what I do.
[144:05.34]Better if you lead.
[144:06.68]I'm not crossing this crapped out bridge.
[144:08.62]No way.
[144:09.38]To find the others, we gotta cross.
[144:11.92]We got no choice.
[144:12.58]Alright, Etalyx, don't mess up the jump QTE.
[144:18.50]Fuck hooking up with those guys.
[144:19.78]Well, they're gonna burn you at the stake.
[144:21.62]We gotta look out for ourselves.
[144:25.22]I'll go out in front then.
[144:30.66]Oh, I have to do it?
[144:33.55]I have a feeling we're gonna get, like, 100% worst ending death, everyone.
[144:38.30]No.
[144:38.62]Eh, it was just a debate.
[144:45.42]We're fine.
[144:46.78]What the hell is that?
[145:04.86]Ooh.
[145:06.18]What's that?
[145:14.31]Witch grave?
[145:17.75]The stone is believed.
[145:18.53]That's pretty fucked up.
[145:20.21]That's not too much reading, it's less than a paragraph.
[145:34.72]Why was he like that?
[145:47.18]The fountain of all evil is here That that little girl is evil evil here, that's an evil dog.
[145:56.20]I don't get it Mr.. Pickles is evil proclaimed it so with her dying testimony If it's evil is to end
[146:03.43]Mary must be stopped.
[146:07.36]He's going to trick us into killing the little kid.
[146:09.90]Probably.
[146:13.42]That child is trouble, but you can't believe she's really evil.
[146:16.98]There it lies.
[146:18.20]I found it.
[146:20.38]Or she's going to kill us accidentally.
[146:22.24]I take it to protect you.
[146:26.93]Suspicion and betrayal walk side by side in Little Oak.
[146:30.65]No one is safe.
[146:31.97]That's Taylor, right?
[146:34.75]Please, Tabitha, let me keep here.
[146:40.56]No, it's Tabitha.
[146:41.26]Etalyx, hold me.
[146:44.78]Hey.
[147:02.19]Do you have anything to say about that?
[147:03.73]That was pretty fucked up.
[147:04.96]Apparently not.
[147:12.72]He fucked off like 30 minutes ago.
[147:14.88]Where'd he go?
[147:19.39]Nothing.
[147:21.63]No working phone anywhere.
[147:23.21]Okay, so it looks like we really are trapped here.
[147:26.46]Still no sign of him?
[147:27.74]Nope.
[147:27.96]Are we still looking for a working phone?
[147:30.12]That's the only thing.
[147:31.22]We're just looking for a way to communicate with the outside world still.
[147:35.72]That's what I did while you were separated.
[147:39.13]And it didn't go well.
[147:41.57]Well, she is.
[147:47.31]I think she wants us to go after her.
[147:50.91]Two girls we've seen.
[147:53.42]One is from the past.
[147:55.20]This one is from here and now.
[147:58.12]Maybe the girl we're seeing here is somehow a mirror image of the girl from the 17th century.
[148:03.59]Yes.
[148:04.05]Don't you want to wait for Daniel and Taylor?
[148:05.91]If this takes place in 1701, isn't this the 18th century?
[148:11.57]You're thinking there.
[148:13.15]That's true.
[148:15.24]Stay loose.
[148:17.20]Who knows what's up ahead?
[148:25.14]That was weird.
[148:25.62]It's because that lady died.
[148:29.88]It just jump cut to us here.
[148:31.70]Maybe if we didn't.
[148:32.58]That was weird.
[148:35.02]Memento.
[148:35.52]Alright, you ready?
[148:38.98]I feel like this is an opportunity for somebody to die.
[148:44.71]There's something blocking the door.
[148:46.41]Give me a hand, will ya?
[148:50.11]It's a little girl.
[148:55.79]Heavy chair This place is a museum of some kind She in there, it's not a museum.
[149:11.28]It's just really an old house Thank God I'm not Andrew because if you shoot yourself in the head, but if it was me I would have to give a thousand community subs to my community
[149:25.65]Yeah, but we're both Andrew.
[149:27.65]No, you're Andrew right now.
[149:28.95]So if you shoot yourself in the head with the gun, I don't have to do anything.
[149:31.47]Uh, what?
[149:32.29]These are dummies?
[149:33.89]Book is on sale.
[149:34.83]It's only $8.
[149:56.62]Ooh, I can open this.
[150:03.10]What if Etalyx shoots you in the head?
[150:05.80]No.
[150:08.00]The deal was, if I had an opportunity to shoot myself in the head with the gun, and I, like, right-click, aim, gun at head, shoot head with gun, then I would give a thousand community subs, because I said there's no way I would do that.
[150:19.02]I'm not going to make that.
[150:19.57]I'm not going to let it happen.
[150:23.55]I already read this book.
[150:25.81]Oh, this is the mannequin house.
[150:29.19]One of these mannequins.
[150:30.71]You try this door.
[150:31.93]Ain't a mannequin.
[150:32.59]I don't even know where you are.
[150:36.07]I'm in the same room.
[150:50.16]I'm stuck.
[150:51.84]Wait, hold on.
[150:58.33]Are there any doors that actually open?
[151:00.27]Or are we just stuck in here?
[151:07.78]It's a museum.
[151:08.64]You're always stuck in there.
[151:12.12]You just read stuff.
[151:13.52]Writ of forfeiture.
[151:16.54]Yeah, yeah.
[151:17.69]Did you push all these hanging mannequins by chance?
[151:21.31]I did not.
[151:23.34]Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[151:24.66]The Board of Selection on the 7th day of January, 1692.
[151:26.75]Uh, you were awarded to two caricatures of the land by Western River, and they were their dwellings upon the land, so they fall forward or whatever.
[151:39.50]You found a secret.
[151:43.74]It says...
[151:51.51]Mary confessed to bad stuff.
[151:54.89]She did.
[151:55.79]Mary confessed.
[151:58.59]Well, what the heck?
[152:00.99]It was her testimony that got the other person killed.
[152:06.60]Oh.
[152:07.02]And this kid Mary, you snitch.
[152:08.18]Did that cut off for you?
[152:10.64]Yeah, this kid Mary had schnitzel?
[152:13.64]The enclosed puppet or doll is thought to have originally belonged to a child.
[152:17.32]Come take a look at this.
[152:24.82]I've seen this before.
[152:27.38]Where?
[152:28.80]On the road outside that shitty little bar we stopped at.
[152:31.01]Alright, well, come on.
[152:32.51]Angela and me saw it laying there, picked it up.
[152:34.63]Wasn't that bad.
[152:35.09]Right before that kid Mary scared us for the first time.
[152:37.35]Interesting.
[152:42.85]You think she maybe led us here?
[152:46.85]Wanted us to see this?
[152:52.06]How many video games is this that dude in that's Andrew?
[152:54.98]I feel like I see his computer-generated face all the fucking time.
[153:00.08]Um... Maybe you just watched every trailer for this game.
[153:04.87]Uhh...
[153:20.27]No, that's a bad idea.
[153:22.41]You want to get intentionally throwing.
[153:24.71]You're probably right.
[153:29.26]I'm getting a little carried away here.
[153:34.32]Bandersnatch was kind of a video game.
[153:41.26]Yeah, it kind of was, but I've seen his face before in CG like this.
[153:45.78]More than once or twice.
[153:52.79]Wait, why are we looking at the doll again?
[153:53.81]We're gonna have, like, another conversation about the doll.
[154:04.02]Where's the gift shop?
[154:05.26]It was the kid in Toy Story.
[154:07.84]That wasn't based on anybody's real face.
[154:13.51]Did this museum ever even open?
[154:14.81]R.D.
[154:14.91]Ford's friends.
[154:22.92]be so satisfying cat yep cat's gonna mean something cat's gonna start talking or it's gonna lead us somewhere and the cat saves the day the cat is the uh transformation that the guy in the office that like doesn't add break to talk to us is he's like watching us oh right yeah that makes sense that's him
[154:53.29]Okay.
[155:24.33]What did we find out?
[155:25.17]What did we do in there?
[155:26.83]That was worth talking about.
[155:29.73]It's time for our lore.
[155:32.99]It's almost 7 p.m.
[155:34.89]Yeah, you're right.
[155:35.67]We're pretty overdue for a lore hand grab.
[155:37.63]You're right.
[155:40.77]No apps on your phone?
[155:44.84]What kind of alien person are you?
[155:53.21]Where the hell are the others?
[155:55.01]Probably as lost as us.
[155:56.53]Are we split?
[155:57.13]Are you Daniel?
[155:57.75]Oh, I'm Daniel.
[155:58.63]Could be.
[155:59.43]The professor was real keen to get into town.
[156:03.21]Oh, yeah.
[156:03.51]Let's go through the sewer.
[156:06.17]You don't want to climb through the sewer, Great?
[156:09.53]Hey, there's literally a fire on the... Look up.
[156:13.13]Look up.
[156:14.15]Look towards the sewer, but up.
[156:16.05]I can't.
[156:18.57]I can't look up.
[156:19.35]What do you mean you can't look up?
[156:20.65]I'm trying, okay.
[156:21.85]Yeah?
[156:22.07]Come over here.
[156:22.53]Oh, yeah, there's a video, there's a fire, you're right.
[156:24.73]Yeah, just walk towards the light.
[156:27.29]Alright, well, let's go.
[156:28.49]You can't, well, you can't.
[156:29.49]I think we have to go through the sewer.
[156:30.62]Because video game characters can't climb.
[156:34.68]Without a QTE.
[156:38.28]Okay.
[156:39.42]Okay.
[156:41.52]Leave it at the door here.
[156:42.96]Okay.
[156:43.64]I don't, we don't want to get, you don't want to get me angry.
[156:46.21]Okay.
[156:53.31]I just realized the double meaning of what I just said.
[156:58.13]I wouldn't want you to lose another.
[156:59.15]I don't even care.
[157:01.82]I'll be honest.
[157:02.68]Anybody getting sick of let's find a way into the house?
[157:06.42]I feel like this happens over and over again in this game.
[157:24.47]Dude, we gotta find a phone.
[157:26.73]Even though we all have phones, but we gotta find a landline.
[157:29.29]Oh, a house?
[157:30.35]Find a way in.
[157:30.79]Okay.
[157:32.05]Another place?
[157:32.73]Let's find a way in.
[157:33.95]Ah, that door's locked.
[157:34.55]Find a way around the other side.
[157:35.47]Crawl in the window.
[157:36.76]Not getting through this way.
[157:40.88]Why can't there just be open doors?
[157:49.56]Wait.
[157:49.66]Gotta go through the skylight.
[157:50.80]This is the museum.
[157:54.89]Probably on, like, two or three different timelines.
[157:56.55]It's probably just gonna... They're gonna do some Saw ending.
[157:59.03]And it'd be like... They're gonna explain the whole thing.
[158:05.01]I think we gotta go through this window.
[158:06.97]Yeah.
[158:09.65]Hey, Daniel.
[158:10.79]Look here.
[158:11.75]Found a way in?
[158:12.91]Take a look.
[158:17.92]Don't think anyone's visited for a long time.
[158:19.06]Another window.
[158:19.68]Oh, let's try to open it.
[158:21.12]Oh, yeah.
[158:21.90]And that's ten bucks you owe me.
[158:24.47]I never shot myself in the head with a gun.
[158:27.63]I don't owe you anything.
[158:28.39]We've done this like four times.
[158:42.74]What?
[158:42.88]I don't want to open another fucking window and crawl into a building.
[158:45.66]Like, what the fuck?
[158:46.54]Alright, alright, alright.
[158:47.56]Listen, you only get four options.
[158:49.08]Option one, open a door.
[158:51.01]Option two, open a window.
[158:52.55]Option three, cross a bridge.
[158:53.95]And option four, get grabbed for lore.
[158:56.79]Pick one.
[159:00.17]I choose lore hand over anything else.
[159:03.07]Alright, find a way to the others.
[159:10.85]Did they just get jumpscared by the same mannequins that we just walked past in the last gameplay segment?
[159:16.27]Yeah, but they came in through the window.
[159:18.67]Yeah, but it was supposed to scare us.
[159:20.73]Oh.
[159:21.94]These things look so real.
[159:24.52]They're freaking me out.
[159:27.14]What's up?
[159:29.44]I just...
[159:31.49]I just saw something.
[159:32.21]And enough with the movie trailer run across the frame.
[159:35.93]Alright.
[159:37.09]You don't have to render the model of the monster that way.
[159:39.37]Where the hell are you going?
[159:40.49]That's true.
[159:41.91]Just a silhouette.
[159:43.21]You sure this is a good move?
[159:44.13]Nope.
[159:53.92]Hey, get in there and like take a picture.
[159:55.24]I'm stuck in here.
[159:57.80]I'm in the medieval times.
[159:59.58]I'm gonna run Instagram.
[160:03.32]Okay, I'm going in for lore.
[160:06.54]Oh, you are?
[160:07.32]I just heard a crunch.
[160:14.84]Okay, he's been ported.
[160:16.10]There was a crunch and then he disappeared.
[160:18.44]I'm going in for lore.
[160:21.61]Where are you?
[160:25.69]God damn it!
[160:27.33]We both have a hand of cards in our hands.
[160:30.11]I got walk around as NPC and climb through a window.
[160:33.00]He got lore hand.
[160:34.16]Bullshit!
[160:36.68]He top decked that!
[160:54.09]Taylor!
[160:58.83]He's not even in there.
[161:06.70]It's not going to open.
[161:07.64]Oh, no.
[161:10.72]I just drew from my deck.
[161:12.22]Can't open door by pushing on it hard.
[161:16.40]What's next?
[161:22.29]Hey.
[161:25.37]Easy.
[161:26.63]What happened?
[161:28.77]You just bowled me over.
[161:29.93]I heard voices.
[161:30.85]Deb, what happened in here?
[161:32.51]What'd you do?
[161:33.45]You got lore snatched.
[161:35.47]I saw my fucking self looking back at me, dressed all weird, speaking funny.
[161:40.77]I mean, what the fuck?
[161:43.89]Hmm.
[161:47.57]Hmm.
[161:48.87]Sorry I wasn't there for you.
[161:51.58]This woman, the one who looked like me, they just dragged her out like some kind of criminal.
[161:56.80]I mean, shit.
[161:59.48]Pathetic?
[162:00.10]What?
[162:01.40]What?
[162:04.41]Let's get out of here.
[162:05.61]I hear that.
[162:06.31]So I saw the little kid in like the 1700s and she started flossing and then they said that she was demon possessed.
[162:13.97]You know, I kind of wish that's really what happened.
[162:16.19]I would give this game a full letter grade if that were real.
[162:19.96]It's not that far off from what happened, but then they took the other person.
[162:27.10]They took my double instead.
[162:29.69]I found a knife.
[162:32.25]Maybe it was a knife once.
[162:34.33]When dinosaurs roamed the Earth.
[162:36.43]It said pathetic, yeah.
[162:37.89]I'm not pathetic.
[162:43.57]Here.
[162:44.29]You take it.
[162:44.73]Uh, why?
[162:47.14]Alright, if you stab yourself in the head, it's $2,000.
[162:49.78]No, you can't say that.
[162:51.96]No, you take it.
[162:52.48]I don't want it.
[162:52.90]You have it.
[162:53.24]I'm not taking it.
[163:02.13]I don't have the knife.
[163:03.49]How did I?
[163:05.07]I gave it to you first.
[163:06.57]But I gave it back to you.
[163:11.25]I telltaled you, dude.
[163:13.37]You tried.
[163:13.79]I tried.
[163:14.77]We both tried.
[163:18.09]Watch the knife just be on the ground.
[163:23.03]Where am I keeping the knife is what I want to know.
[163:25.09]It's a knife.
[163:26.73]It doesn't have a sheath.
[163:27.50]Did I just put it in my pants?
[163:34.01]That wasn't even scary.
[163:34.95]It's just dangerous.
[163:41.00]I found the Bible, but there's no lore.
[163:42.66]It just says Bible.
[163:45.42]Oh, never mind.
[163:46.44]I found all the witchcraft.
[163:48.13]Oh, I found a caricature.
[163:54.49]And a piece of wood.
[163:55.81]Oh, this is the wood that I hit the demon in the head with.
[163:57.81]The 2x4.
[164:08.15]You mean Lambert.
[164:09.16]Amy was accused of witchcraft by the girl Mary Milton, who claimed she saw her fly on a twig of willow.
[164:16.32]And told by the court that Amy had been seen by witnesses many miles away, Mary stated, I saw her lips ever chattering to who knew what and recognized her as a demon sent to me in Amy's form.
[164:29.51]Pastor Carver admitted this into the record as spectral evidence.
[164:34.49]That was a paragraph.
[164:35.13]I'm fine.
[164:36.49]Hey, can you come over here?
[164:38.17]Sure.
[164:42.67]Do you think this is like chiropractors in the 1700s right here?
[164:47.94]This?
[164:48.96]No.
[164:49.84]What are my flashlights pointing at?
[164:51.44]That's a cheese wheel.
[164:52.48]That's like a Rumpelstiltskin wheel.
[164:54.94]No.
[164:56.06]Yeah.
[165:01.14]Yeah.
[165:01.46]We're going to rid your body of pain by putting pain on top of you.
[165:06.83]It's probably like... No, this is torture, right?
[165:14.44]I think, um... Just T-posing.
[165:18.58]Okay, so what else do we have to do in our second playthrough of the museum level?
[165:22.46]I heard a loud noise, but I didn't see anything.
[165:24.66]It was this.
[165:25.20]This thing just fell over, tried to scare me.
[165:26.78]Didn't even work.
[165:29.38]I looked at that already.
[165:31.36]Don't look at it again.
[165:32.02]Don't look at it again.
[165:32.78]Oh, my fucking God.
[165:33.78]Don't look at it.
[165:39.29]We didn't look in here, right?
[165:41.87]Yeah, we checked this area.
[165:43.91]Clues.
[165:44.83]Yeah, you read this one.
[165:46.57]What about this painting?
[165:48.82]The doll's gone.
[165:49.78]That's what the thing is.
[165:51.78]Oh.
[165:52.48]They took the doll.
[165:55.00]Uh, this is... The Ace Attorney thing.
[166:05.75]The enclosed poppet, or doll, is thought to have originally belonged to a child in the late 1600s.
[166:10.81]Yeah, the doll's gone, yeah.
[166:13.71]Creepy.
[166:15.05]Window scare.
[166:17.09]Shit, wait, I got it.
[166:18.09]Oh, it's the cat again.
[166:18.87]This missing doll has got to be the one I saw with the kid.
[166:23.12]You think?
[166:23.52]That's kind of weird.
[166:26.50]Kind of weird?
[166:26.94]People are saying we should have burnt it.
[166:27.84]This place is full-on nightmare central.
[166:30.08]I don't want to stay here any longer than I have to.
[166:32.04]We had an opportunity to burn it, remember?
[166:33.34]With you on that.
[166:33.88]The last two?
[166:34.32]What?
[166:35.99]Oh, you don't know that.
[166:36.75]It said, burn it or put it back.
[166:39.87]Oh, yeah, I didn't know that.
[166:41.09]Yeah, but I didn't want to be, like, intentionally ruin the game Andy.
[166:44.87]Fuck, I'm saying Andy a lot.
[166:46.26]Hang on, how many Andys are there?
[166:47.68]I'm saying Andy a lot.
[166:49.02]Alright, no more, I'm not going to say Andy anymore.
[166:54.42]You're kind of an Andy Andy.
[167:01.71]One guy said it, like, a month ago.
[167:03.77]And, like, some people said it.
[167:05.24]And then I... It was during a Fall Guys stream.
[167:06.78]It was the worst Fall Guys player... I'm the worst Fall Guys player on Twitch, first of all.
[167:11.18]And I just... It just stuck with me.
[167:13.68]Did you ever even get a medal?
[167:15.32]No.
[167:15.92]Not one.
[167:17.10]No, that's not... I did.
[167:17.92]I got one medal because everybody disconnected.
[167:19.87]And I was the last person in the game.
[167:21.51]That's real.
[167:25.06]It still counts.
[167:26.04]Does it count?
[167:26.58]I mean, you got like five, didn't you?
[167:28.46]Oh, hello.
[167:30.16]I got like three.
[167:31.08]Are things becoming any clearer for you?
[167:33.32]Oh, it's my knife.
[167:40.08]Oh, that is the knife.
[167:40.62]You're right.
[167:47.95]Another instrument of death added to the group's collection.
[167:53.43]Good work.
[167:59.78]Let me help you out.
[168:01.78]Give you one little... Hint.
[168:04.82]He's so badly... Stop exceeding.
[168:06.38]Okay.
[168:07.35]We don't talk about this.
[168:08.85]We don't talk about this?
[168:09.93]Okay.
[168:10.47]But we just have to decide.
[168:13.07]One says yes and one says no.
[168:14.99]I said yes.
[168:16.35]Well, here's a hint for people that can't cooperate.
[168:20.37]Co-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O-O.
[168:25.05]The best line of the game so far.
[168:27.65]I'll leave you now with some wise words from a great Irish playwright I once met.
[168:33.51]I feel like the devs reaching out to us, like, please, God, just work together.
[168:39.74]Never judge anyone shortly.
[168:42.30]Every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.
[168:48.14]So is it a lore hint?
[168:49.84]I'm assuming he tells you a piece of the story.
[168:52.48]Uh...
[168:57.03]You remember how, like, Man of Medan, he tried to, like, give us a hint that the monsters are not what they seem.
[169:03.69]But without just spoiling the game, why even have that?
[169:07.19]I don't understand.
[169:07.91]I don't know.
[169:10.13]He's just asking if you want to read his Wikipedia article he's going to read to you.
[169:13.89]I think because most people who play these games, we'll call them normal people, don't want all the characters to die when the credits roll.
[169:22.90]But when you do a psycho playthrough, we...
[169:26.04]Or pretty ambivalent about them.
[169:27.99]I'll make sure of that.
[169:29.51]Oh, okay.
[169:30.25]I'm going for the... I see a shiny thing, so I'm just going to pick it up.
[169:33.07]Yeah, this is shiny over here, too.
[169:42.95]Um... Oh.
[169:44.93]This is... I mean, the one piece of wood blocking the thing.
[169:49.92]Well, I know who's next on the chopping block.
[169:54.05]And, uh... It ain't me!
[169:56.27]What do you mean?
[169:57.15]How do you know?
[170:02.91]You know?
[170:03.81]Did you get a premonition?
[170:05.17]Oh, I know!
[170:05.71]Alright, does it involve... Does it involve a gun being pointed to anyone's head?
[170:12.38]I just figured something out.
[170:14.02]Stand right behind me.
[170:19.52]But, like, over one of my shoulders.
[170:24.37]Oh, you bumped me.
[170:25.59]Apparently, if you go idle for, like, more than 10 seconds, it does, like, a zoom-in.
[170:30.97]And you get the Man of Badan, like, facial.
[170:33.95]Oh.
[170:42.32]You have to wait.
[170:43.82]I am.
[170:44.62]He's just... If it doesn't do it again, it's going to be really embarrassing.
[170:52.64]It's not doing it.
[170:55.55]Maybe it's because you were looking at the lore.
[170:57.01]I don't know.
[170:57.51]But I got the full... Oh, there it is.
[171:00.07]No.
[171:01.41]I want to raise his hands and go... And fall asleep like fucking Super Mario.
[171:12.13]Who's bumping me out of it?
[171:13.57]Did you bump me again?
[171:15.13]I'm not even close to you.
[171:16.08]I'm on the road.
[171:20.94]Hang on.
[171:22.83]Oh, sorry.
[171:23.21]I didn't appropriate the noise correctly.
[171:25.29]That noise I made was Mario climbing up a cliff.
[171:29.51]What I meant to say was Mario was tired.
[171:31.90]Right.
[171:32.64]I got the noises wrong.
[171:33.46]I apologize.
[171:35.56]Yeah, okay.
[171:35.98]I'm done.
[171:37.26]Are you here?
[171:38.30]Yeah.
[171:45.50]Yeah, it's I'm a tired.
[171:46.88]Yeah, that's my fault.
[171:48.16]I feel bad for dissing Angela the whole time.
[171:52.01]I can never make that right.
[171:57.49]The tourist office.
[171:59.41]The same road.
[172:03.63]Honestly, there are some Call of Duty maps that are bigger than this.
[172:15.06]You're blowing this out.
[172:15.96]It's overexposed.
[172:16.82]I can't say this.
[172:18.02]It's your flashlight.
[172:19.16]This place is a real ghost town.
[172:30.70]Is this the gas lighting stream?
[172:32.28]This place is as big as fuckin' Nuketown.
[172:35.70]Oh, the fog's coming back.
[172:39.34]Foreclosure.
[172:40.04]Bank owned.
[172:40.62]Keep up.
[172:44.00]Flash lighting stream.
[172:46.27]Ugh.
[172:46.43]Alright, we've got a roadblock, so we've got to take the detour.
[172:55.31]Or we can walk up to the roadblock, let them say, it's a roadblock!
[172:58.81]And then we can take the detour.
[172:59.61]That's what I know.
[173:00.13]That's what's gonna happen.
[173:04.51]Where the hell is that coming from?
[173:05.51]It's coming from the crow.
[173:08.93]It's like a Bluetooth speaker.
[173:11.20]The significance to the crow.
[173:15.44]Oh, that wasn't a cutscene.
[173:16.66]I was just itching my nose.
[173:22.52]Uh...
[173:28.46]Okay, that was a little late.
[173:35.83]Oh, we can go this way.
[173:47.02]Here, check this out.
[173:50.82]Dude, tire swing.
[173:51.80]I also just wish the characters didn't walk around like they have sandbags on their shoes.
[173:54.78]This is impossible.
[173:56.74]I know those markings.
[173:59.40]What's it doing here?
[174:00.36]I lived in Little Hope when I was 10.
[174:02.50]I mean, there's a lot of wacky shit going on.
[174:06.22]How would I not believe this?
[174:30.68]Oh.
[174:30.78]You don't look alright.
[174:36.46]Um... Can somebody push that monster in?
[174:37.70]Oh.
[174:38.42]Oh!
[174:38.56]No, it's alright.
[174:39.04]We both got lore snatched this time.
[174:56.96]Alright, I'm gonna try to help this time.
[174:58.84]Please help me before it is too late.
[175:00.62]Because last time I didn't try to help, and it went bad.
[175:02.98]Only the Almighty can forgive your sin.
[175:05.35]That is your only hope of salvation.
[175:07.29]Listen to me.
[175:08.71]I have committed no sin.
[175:10.77]The puppet I am condemned for is a child's plaything.
[175:14.25]Nothing more.
[175:14.95]I swear it.
[175:16.13]Oh, it was just hysteria.
[175:17.53]I see the evil in you.
[175:19.19]My duty is to cleanse our town of your sickness.
[175:22.21]There is no other way.
[175:24.65]You must hang.
[175:27.25]That guy didn't have a face.
[175:28.31]There's Andrew.
[175:29.01]Because it's his, like, adopted sister.
[175:30.76]I don't think we can do anything.
[175:56.46]Did you get a decision?
[175:57.74]I didn't get a decision.
[175:58.62]I think that she just dies.
[176:01.88]But isn't that my character?
[176:03.16]Yeah, but remember, Judy died.
[176:07.06]What?
[176:08.64]Yeah, but I got an option to, like, step in or do something.
[176:12.18]Oh.
[176:13.72]Like, say something.
[176:14.68]Final death to premonition.
[176:21.47]I didn't get a prompt or anything.
[176:24.15]By the way, it's actually...
[176:26.73]He told us to cooperate, so I'm going to cooperate.
[176:29.91]It's not me.
[176:31.13]It's you.
[176:32.09]Okay.
[176:34.31]We didn't switch characters.
[176:35.73]Actually, it's probably just both of us.
[176:37.09]We're probably just all going to get visited.
[176:39.55]Sure.
[176:40.19]We're all going to get a visit from the devil.
[176:42.97]I saw the spike from the monster about to go into your face.
[176:47.41]You did?
[176:47.73]Yeah.
[176:49.45]What?
[176:50.53]Wait, wait, wait.
[176:51.91]Cat.
[176:53.79]We got a cat over here.
[176:56.23]Can somebody call, like, animal control?
[176:58.97]What would you do?
[177:01.85]Well, nope.
[177:02.21]We can't.
[177:02.71]Obviously, we can't catch it.
[177:04.91]I.U.
[177:05.11]Yeah, that'll work.
[177:07.14]Fuck off.
[177:09.62]Get the fuck out of here, dude.
[177:11.48]Don't we have a knife?
[177:21.01]Oh my god.
[177:22.95]Um, do we, uh, what do we do?
[177:25.67]Do we, do we?
[177:27.31]Oh, we're gonna run, we're gonna run, we're gonna run.
[177:33.42]What?
[177:34.34]I, you don't, don't even tell me I got that wrong.
[177:40.00]Oh.
[178:05.86]I don't know why, but for a second I thought you just had socks on.
[178:08.06]I was like, why don't you have shoes on?
[178:12.40]Damn dude, alright, I'm catching up.
[178:20.92]We're good?
[178:23.26]We just keep seeing, like, the feet.
[178:26.68]Can we see the face?
[178:29.60]That one was quick.
[178:30.52]This one's hard, dude.
[178:31.74]Be careful.
[178:32.14]Ah, yeah.
[178:40.82]Keep moving!
[178:41.48]Go!
[178:47.45]It's not gonna last.
[178:48.37]This road goes in a loop.
[178:50.05]Like, where are we gonna go?
[178:51.73]Yeah, are we going in a circle?
[178:59.56]The floating pair of legs.
[179:01.34]Look out!
[179:02.06]Hey!
[179:17.20]Are we just gonna sacrifice that guy?
[179:18.70]Come on!
[179:19.28]Move it!
[179:20.66]Leave him!
[179:21.06]Leave him!
[179:21.52]Hey!
[179:22.28]Run!
[179:22.74]Get inside!
[179:23.92]He doesn't... Does he not see it?
[179:27.08]I'm gonna go help him, dude.
[179:28.84]Go get him!
[179:29.38]Go get him!
[179:30.04]Hey!
[179:30.20]That thing is almost on you!
[179:32.98]It's right on your ass!
[179:35.17]Gun!
[179:36.85]Gun!
[179:38.13]Watch out!
[179:38.59]What the fuck are you doing?
[179:40.21]What?
[179:40.39]Are you crazy?
[179:41.39]Did you do that?
[179:42.11]Get in here!
[179:45.29]Hey!
[179:47.88]Did I miss?
[179:48.76]I just turned and she was right in the fucking head.
[179:52.20]No, I didn't miss.
[179:55.03]I just shot at it.
[179:55.57]Wait, is that... Wait, we barricaded this guy out?
[179:57.07]We gotta let this guy in.
[179:59.09]Take the barricade off.
[180:19.94]Are we serious?
[180:20.49]Why the hell is that old fool still out there?
[180:26.22]A magic feather.
[180:26.90]It's a lore feather!
[180:28.02]Oh, there's a monster.
[180:29.04]What are you talking about?
[180:30.90]That guy-
[180:57.23]Are we in different lore or the same one?
[180:58.51]Yeah.
[180:58.69]Why can't I just say, hey?
[181:00.24]We're not together, right?
[181:31.73]Who said it was your call to make, dude?
[181:43.45]What?
[181:44.49]This guy thinks he's making calls.
[181:49.43]He wants to hook up with the ghost version of his dead... Wait, was that his sister or wife?
[181:55.17]I don't know.
[181:56.33]I feel like we're in the same room watching different movies on opposite TVs in the room.
[182:03.82]It's me.
[182:05.30]I'm next.
[182:07.75]Yeah, that's what I said.
[182:10.69]Who knew that the ghost could be kept out just by blocking a door?
[182:13.15]Whatever.
[182:14.39]Made accusations against my double.
[182:17.37]Sounded serious.
[182:18.75]Another trial?
[182:20.74]Not this time.
[182:22.66]It sure looked like it was heading that way.
[182:24.66]And the girl?
[182:26.06]Mary?
[182:26.36]I'm surprised he lasted this long.
[182:29.06]She was there, alright.
[182:32.93]We secure in here?
[182:34.13]You find any other ways in?
[182:39.58]Sorry, professor.
[182:40.24]I didn't check.
[182:42.06]I love how the time they need to process language.
[182:45.10]It's so funny.
[182:46.78]I love it.
[182:47.14]I'm losing another student.
[182:50.99]Stay on the roof.
[182:52.33]I think we have to stay here because it's a church.
[182:53.93]It's still out there.
[182:55.57]Hey, grab the cross.
[182:56.97]Look over there.
[183:00.34]We have to follow her.
[183:01.76]Whoever she is, she's tied up in everything that's happened here.
[183:05.30]What if you're right?
[183:06.10]What then?
[183:07.30]If we can stop her, it could prevent any more harm happening to our doubles.
[183:12.00]Okay.
[183:12.90]It happened 300 years ago.
[183:14.63]They're dead either way.
[183:16.03]Yeah, I guess I'm kind of confused as to what the fuck is even happening in this story.
[183:21.49]So these are our doubles, but it's us.
[183:23.71]Like our ancestors or just us?
[183:27.03]I don't know.
[183:29.33]Tripping through time.
[183:33.13]What if those are like the actual stunt doubles?
[183:37.73]For like the motion capture.
[183:42.39]Changing the past.
[183:43.71]Yeah.
[183:43.99]I don't know.
[183:53.37]Hey, kid?
[183:55.37]You out here?
[184:01.74]Are we in the bell tower?
[184:05.90]I don't know.
[184:06.46]Are you Andrew?
[184:07.98]Am I Andrew?
[184:08.52]Or are you Daniel?
[184:09.56]I'm Daniel or Andrew.
[184:10.72]Okay.
[184:11.68]Well, I think we're both up.
[184:12.42]I'm up here, too.
[184:13.84]Lore grab.
[184:17.84]Sick.
[184:23.77]Did you get lore grab, too?
[184:25.31]Yeah, I'm here, too.
[184:27.53]They couldn't get all the lore in the last place.
[184:29.19]They had to split it up into two chapters here.
[184:34.43]It pains me to say these words, but your punishment today will protect us all.
[184:38.95]Keep our town safe.
[184:40.21]Why haven't we tried to, like, touch anybody yet?
[184:42.41]We did, actually.
[184:46.04]When I was Daniel, I grabbed somebody and they said, I froze!
[184:49.84]You please cannot reach him.
[184:51.68]My fate is not a memory you should carry.
[184:53.76]He will be my keeper if you are gone.
[184:55.36]Should have thought about that before you killed him.
[184:58.81]He will be your keeper.
[185:01.07]A decision not all are in agreement with.
[185:06.12]Every man will face his day of judgment.
[185:07.66]Oh, it's going to be like he died in the... No!
[185:11.51]I almost missed that, QTE.
[185:14.39]Oh, you see, that's what I did.
[185:17.33]I didn't know there was going to be one.
[185:18.51]That was close.
[185:18.97]He's being held up by nothing, but you're not here.
[185:21.91]Oh, I got you.
[185:22.87]It's a spirit.
[185:32.90]Your turn, QTE time.
[185:33.90]I didn't get a QTE.
[185:39.09]Oh, I didn't either.
[185:42.76]But it's like the guy died in the prologue.
[185:44.48]It's the fire.
[185:45.20]Wait, did you get a QTE?
[185:47.10]I don't know if I should trust you.
[185:48.38]Did you get a QTE?
[185:49.10]No, I swear to God I didn't get a QTE.
[185:51.10]I am so dead laser focused on QTEs now because of the intentional throw.
[185:57.70]You're right.
[185:58.51]I'm laser focused on QTEs because of that.
[186:02.31]My reputation is forever tarnished.
[186:03.59]I have to try to build it back up.
[186:10.58]Chat is all saying you're sus right now.
[186:14.24]No, I didn't have a QTE.
[186:15.40]I swear to God, go watch the VOD.
[186:18.14]No, I'm not going to watch your VOD.
[186:19.21]I'm playing the game.
[186:22.97]I'm here.
[186:23.19]Don't you want to see my perspective?
[186:25.71]Nothing I could do.
[186:33.01]There won't be any more VODs once we get timed up for that song at the prologue.
[186:38.26]Say hi to Daniel, everyone.
[186:40.92]Holy shit, that was incredibly condescending and horrible.
[186:43.50]Like, that was terrible.
[186:44.74]I didn't know it was going to be that 100 miles per hour.
[186:47.40]Alright, I'm just going to go along with it.
[186:48.94]I don't know.
[186:51.79]What are my member benefits?
[186:54.11]I'm not dead.
[186:55.11]He is beanie.
[186:56.77]Don't bury me.
[186:57.85]Oh, that's quite the response.
[187:01.85]Why did that kid Mary want us to see her brother executed?
[187:04.79]Um...
[187:14.14]Daniel, you're wicked high right now.
[187:15.68]Come on.
[187:15.84]You don't know where you've seen Mary?
[187:17.76]No, the fire.
[187:18.00]We all were in the same house.
[187:19.24]Yeah.
[187:39.50]Maybe we don't remember that.
[187:40.48]Come on!
[187:40.84]Maybe we don't know that.
[187:42.02]Maybe that was like another past self or something.
[187:44.58]Like a future self or... I don't know.
[187:48.20]Listen, this ghost has no access to their arms and legs.
[187:51.35]Just stay somewhere where they can't fly to you.
[187:53.19]And you'll be fine.
[187:56.15]What do we do now?
[187:57.39]With that thing outside?
[187:58.51]Quiet.
[188:02.95]It's out there.
[188:04.51]Listen.
[188:04.85]It's out there.
[188:05.87]For now.
[188:06.66]And we all died in the fire.
[188:08.90]And we all died in the car crash.
[188:10.76]And we're making history right from 300 years ago.
[188:13.20]I have no idea.
[188:13.77]He's right.
[188:14.23]We're safer in here.
[188:14.73]We're staying put.
[188:25.75]Hmm, option one.
[188:27.05]Stay inside where the hanging monster doesn't kill you, or go outside where it could kill you.
[188:33.11]Yeah, why would you leave?
[188:35.13]What to do?
[188:35.71]What happened to the dude outside?
[188:38.51]Where's, um...
[188:56.76]Aren't we missing somebody?
[188:59.00]No, not the old lady.
[188:59.80]I know she's dead.
[189:01.16]Wasn't there... No, it's just these four.
[189:02.96]Alright, besides the windows, out of all the buildings that we have investigated today, this is the A, largest, and B, least full of holes building.
[189:15.53]Yeah, it's also... Wait, what's this?
[189:18.55]Okay, I take that back.
[189:19.51]There's some holes.
[189:22.44]I miss her every day.
[189:23.54]It's not gonna...
[189:36.42]It was a school.
[189:44.91]Church.
[189:46.13]Okay, what's in the church?
[189:52.85]What is Andrew looking at over here?
[189:58.99]Go find the Bible.
[189:59.87]Go do a sermon.
[190:01.54]Sounds like more than one.
[190:03.86]Uh-oh.
[190:04.38]Found something.
[190:05.88]It's the guy.
[190:06.50]He got locked out and he's trying to get in.
[190:08.34]Oh.
[190:10.18]Somebody let him in.
[190:16.10]Okay, it's not the guy.
[190:17.77]It's the harpoon lady.
[190:23.05]Why did we all run outside immediately to stay away from the windows?
[190:27.97]Quick, go out there and get close.
[190:35.69]Oh, that's not good.
[190:37.01]We're all in the mist again.
[190:38.54]Uh, alright.
[190:40.22]I think this is a mute opportunity.
[190:52.54]We are alone.
[190:53.38]What the fuck was that?
[191:05.13]You just have to walk forward until whatever it is tries to kill you.
[191:14.70]Pig?
[191:16.29]Heard pig noise.
[191:20.05]Get ready for the QTE.
[191:21.43]You have no idea how ready I am.
[191:25.51]I'm going to...
[191:27.95]It's gonna be like a hundred... Um... It's... I just... Somebody just got hit in the head by a 2x4.
[191:33.99]Or like a wrench.
[191:36.19]I hope Etalyx is okay.
[191:38.87]I'm not... I'm just... Keep muted.
[191:41.38]I'm just playing.
[191:44.20]I really hope that Etalyx is okay.
[191:50.50]Why?
[191:50.94]What am I doing?
[191:57.52]Oh, fuck.
[191:59.42]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[192:02.68]Oh, no.
[192:04.22]Oh, no, no, no.
[192:05.08]What do I do?
[192:05.59]Which one?
[192:06.29]I'm going left.
[192:16.51]Fuck.
[192:18.05]Who's wrong?
[192:19.86]Oh, shit!
[192:23.28]What do I do?
[192:24.54]Q-T-E.
[192:26.54]I got a knife!
[192:27.85]Thank God I gave the knife back.
[192:29.77]Did I stab myself with the knife?
[192:32.97]Thank God I gave the fucking knife back.
[192:37.88]No, you take the knife.
[192:38.56]No, you take the knife.
[192:39.20]No, you take the knife.
[192:41.16]Turns out it was a fucking thousand IQ play.
[192:50.67]I'm not John!
[192:53.75]I'm in trouble!
[192:55.98]Not John!
[193:04.66]What was that?
[193:05.78]That was the John Travolta, like, what happened?
[193:08.25]What room am I in?
[193:09.81]Oh yeah, shit just went down, probably for both of us.
[193:12.97]Yeah, well, it did.
[193:14.13]But also, like, the guy I was with disappeared in front of my eyes.
[193:18.38]Like, his model vanished.
[193:20.20]It's such a good thing that I gave the knife back to you.
[193:22.30]Otherwise, Taylor is dead if I don't do that.
[193:24.38]I also saved John.
[193:25.40]Good.
[193:25.61]Ugh.
[193:37.07]You're John.
[193:37.59]I saved you.
[193:38.39]Yeah.
[193:38.61]Thanks for saving me.
[193:40.11]Stick together and we'll be fine.
[193:42.85]Fine like Angela, right?
[193:46.19]That's a low blow.
[193:51.16]Alright.
[193:52.42]What's our next move?
[193:54.10]I'm not sure.
[194:03.40]Dude, I was getting, like, almost murdered by the monster, and you just come and you go.
[194:07.54]Were you fighting the hanging monster?
[194:09.04]I was.
[194:09.44]I was fighting the monster.
[194:10.20]I was fighting the crawling monster.
[194:12.44]And you popped in while there's, like, a tongue wrapped around my neck, and I'm fighting for my life, and I hear, are you John?
[194:18.09]Are you asleep?
[194:19.63]That's impressive.
[194:21.41]I wish.
[194:23.75]No way I could get any shut-eye after what went down tonight.
[194:28.29]Would love to, though.
[194:29.09]I'm beat.
[194:32.19]Any ideas how we're getting out of here?
[194:36.41]Why do you always decide where we're going?
[194:39.83]It do end up like that, huh?
[194:41.57]It's clear now.
[194:42.63]There's no help available.
[194:43.85]We're on our own.
[194:45.58]Sure seems that way.
[194:47.42]Our best shot, maybe our only shot, is to stop that girl, Mary.
[194:52.95]Getting to Mary, stopping her might help.
[194:55.33]Sure.
[194:55.67]Okay.
[194:56.11]But what about the other?
[194:57.68]Alright.
[194:57.90]I'm going to call it the one that keeps running from us.
[195:00.74]Mary and her are connected somehow.
[195:02.70]I'm sure of it.
[195:04.04]Maybe the other girl is trying to lead us.
[195:05.60]Oh, you didn't hear it.
[195:07.08]Where?
[195:07.62]I didn't hear it.
[195:08.08]I don't know.
[195:08.40]What are you talking about?
[195:09.52]Maybe to a place we can stop.
[195:11.30]We were separated at the beginning of the game.
[195:13.77]Yeah.
[195:17.15]Mary, the girl in the original house.
[195:21.91]Not even sure she's real.
[195:23.17]Was complaining about no one likes her.
[195:25.63]She's invisible to everyone.
[195:27.87]She also burnt to death.
[195:29.85]You didn't see that part.
[195:30.73]She literally was torched on camera.
[195:33.28]Right, but I think this is the power of friendship.
[195:36.42]If we try to kill her, we all die.
[195:37.90]If we... We owe it to the others.
[195:40.62]Be nice to her, we all live or something.
[195:44.48]Mary's the key to this.
[195:47.52]I'm certain of it.
[195:50.16]He said it, not me this time.
[195:54.91]It's not that simple.
[195:57.91]And like you said, she's just a kid.
[195:59.45]We can't listen to me.
[196:00.79]I get it.
[196:01.75]We see her again.
[196:03.43]We do whatever is necessary.
[196:04.73]There's doubles of each of us.
[196:06.41]Our doubles.
[196:08.25]Keep getting accused of witchcraft.
[196:09.89]Now we're accusing this little kid of witchcraft in our timeline.
[196:12.97]This place is safe, though.
[196:15.18]If we kill her, we do the same thing that killed all of our doubles back in their time.
[196:19.68]Would you look at that?
[196:22.26]Not sure hunting Mary down is a great move, but
[196:25.99]I guess we should stick together.
[196:27.03]But what- but- but who's doing this power?
[196:29.23]Like, how are we doing this?
[196:30.85]What supernatural- Yeah, I don't know who's doing the lore grab.
[196:33.51]Yeah, who's actually doing the lore grab?
[196:45.53]Me.
[196:50.79]Mr. Lore Grabber, smiley face.
[196:53.24]Oh.
[196:53.86]That's- yeah.
[196:54.76]Thanks for the tip.
[197:05.75]God damn it.
[197:07.17]Imagine missing from point blank.
[197:09.87]Yeah.
[197:10.75]Oh, great.
[197:13.15]Here we go.
[197:21.60]Dude, that... Seriously, that was so fast.
[197:24.94]That was insane.
[197:29.09]You're Daniel.
[197:30.25]I'm Andrew.
[197:32.99]How do people trip when they run?
[197:35.09]Like, why do you trip and land flat on your face like you're sliding on a slip and slide?
[197:41.46]That doesn't- people don't- humans don't do that.
[197:43.78]Are both of your shoes tied together?
[197:45.70]God damn it.
[198:00.06]Who are you?
[198:01.30]I'm Andrew.
[198:02.62]Alright, we're gonna have to mute.
[198:03.54]I think I'm right next to you, actually.
[198:05.45]Wait, didn't this... Didn't this just happen?
[198:09.13]Oh, they're tell-tale-ing me.
[198:13.45]What do you mean, you're getting tell-tale-ed?
[198:17.47]I gotta go with my premonition!
[198:20.89]You're saving me?
[198:21.27]Come on!
[198:21.97]Get it out!
[198:30.62]How did I miss?
[198:31.48]I clicked in it.
[198:33.62]You saw me click in the window.
[198:37.76]I clicked in the window.
[198:40.30]I didn't fail that.
[198:41.24]I didn't fail that.
[198:42.72]How did I fail that?
[198:44.20]You go back and you pull that shit back and you throw it.
[198:46.82]I clicked in the circle.
[198:51.22]Take the clip and then slow-mo it.
[198:54.16]I clicked in that circle in plenty of fucking time.
[199:03.45]I did not miss.
[199:04.26]I didn't even miss.
[199:07.72]Give me the clip.
[199:09.34]Show me.
[199:09.64]Show me.
[199:10.28]I want to see it.
[199:11.18]Show me the clip.
[199:11.88]Show me the clip.
[199:12.26]I want to see it.
[199:18.18]I swear to God, I did not miss that QTE.
[199:20.71]I clicked right in the circle with like a half done.
[199:22.59]Don't shoot yourself in the head.
[199:30.37]Don't shoot yourself in the head, please.
[199:36.17]I thought you shot her.
[199:36.83]Who did you shoot?
[199:37.71]He didn't miss.
[199:38.13]He didn't miss.
[199:38.57]Look at that.
[199:39.58]He didn't miss.
[199:42.76]He didn't miss.
[200:00.81]You've definitely been through hell.
[200:02.77]No one can doubt that.
[200:04.11]But we need to keep moving if we want to get out of this place.
[200:10.10]John, another one just died.
[200:12.94]A word, please?
[200:16.10]He literally didn't miss Omega Lull.
[200:18.14]I know.
[200:18.42]I want to watch it.
[200:19.17]It is better to conquer yourself than to win a thousand battles.
[200:23.09]Then the victory is yours.
[200:25.47]It cannot be taken from you.
[200:28.26]Not by angels or by demons, heaven or hell.
[200:35.71]Perhaps you've started to realize something.
[200:42.58]Uh, yes.
[200:44.84]I can't pause the game.
[200:46.14]Oh dude, that's a pretty good hand.
[200:50.97]20 never hit on 20 he just busted I can't I can't click that link guys I can't may not be quite what they appear to be oh he said that in the last game three executions three tormented beings and two lost souls any thoughts on what might be around the corner hidden by the fog
[201:18.24]I don't think that you could save them because they're being judged for their actions in purgatory and they were sent to hell by the demons that crawled up them and it was them because it was their inner demons and all that shit.
[201:31.31]You were literally in the circle.
[201:37.19]I have to pee too.
[201:38.93]Can I go pee?
[201:40.45]Oh yeah, we can take a pee break.
[201:41.63]Let's take a pee break and I want to show this on stream.
[201:43.65]I'll be back in two minutes.
[201:45.03]I'll be back in, uh, I need to take five, so I gotta take dog out.
[201:47.97]Oh, okay, yeah.
[201:48.97]Take five.
[201:51.21]Alright, let me see this fucking link.
[201:54.13]Let me see.
[201:54.98]How, you show me, I wanna see.
[201:59.22]No fucking way.
[202:00.28]Get the hell out of here, this is bullshit.
[202:02.58]How is that, how is that not the circle?
[202:03.82]Are you serious?
[202:18.18]Where is it?
[202:25.05]That's where I clicked.
[202:26.93]That's in the circle.
[202:28.37]That's in the circle.
[202:30.23]That's in the circle.
[202:39.33]Look at that.
[202:40.85]You see where the white ends?
[202:42.66]The white ends, it's right in that inner lip in there.
[202:46.99]That constitutes as a click in the circle.
[202:54.09]It's not outside the circle.
[202:55.34]Outside the circle would be outside that outer ring.
[203:09.99]That is one pixel for life and death of Daniel.
[203:18.12]Sharpen the fuck out of this.
[203:24.04]Where's sharpen?
[203:32.35]Excuse me.
[203:34.25]That's inside that inner lip.
[203:36.45]Enhance it.
[203:47.19]It's outside the inner circle, but it's inside the outer circle by a lot.
[203:52.77]The tip is on the, right on the edge.
[203:54.59]God fucking damn it.
[204:02.24]Alright, alright, but you have to, look, I tried.
[204:06.04]That wasn't like a, oh, I fucking clicked, red, red, red.
[204:15.16]Alright, I'm gonna go pee.
[204:16.40]God damn it, one pixel.
[204:17.81]I'm so... I could have saved that character.
[204:21.61]Fuck.
[204:31.16]Alright, I'll be right back.
[204:35.10]It's inside that fucking circle.
[204:36.89]I'm telling you.
[206:01.89]Hey, is Jerma still gone?
[206:03.03]This is my stream now.
[206:07.98]You can all still hear me.
[206:10.98]I'm in control.
[206:17.28]As my first order of business, as new king of the rats, I will mod the first ten people who talk.
[206:27.97]Starting now.
[206:30.73]And then ban the next ten.
[206:40.06]Choose wisely.
[206:46.37]Hey, Jerma chat, if you're so cool, how come I can't see what you're writing right now?
[206:49.69]That's what I thought.
[206:54.89]How come someone who can't even see your chat can bait you into typing in your chat?
[207:08.22]Easily manipulated.
[207:17.48]Anyway, to my chat, who is far more attractive and patient and kind and loving.
[207:26.94]Oh, hello, my chat.
[207:31.76]You talking shit?
[207:34.74]What's he doing?
[207:36.64]What'd he say?
[207:37.18]I just heard a lot of noise coming through the headphones.
[207:40.12]What'd he say?
[207:43.90]Oh, what?
[207:44.28]Was he talking shit?
[207:45.04]What happened?
[207:46.04]Nope.
[207:46.87]What?
[207:47.01]I was just seeing if you were back.
[207:49.22]Oh, by the way, did you see the image?
[207:50.50]I don't know if you saw the image that's been circulating about the clicking inside the... I was in the circle.
[207:57.56]Can you, uh... Can you link it to me?
[208:00.44]Yeah, here.
[208:03.84]Take a look at this.
[208:09.56]Uh, where is it?
[208:10.20]Somebody give it to me.
[208:12.64]Yeah, it's been circulating on, like, the internet and shit.
[208:15.31]Why is my chat saying you were not in the circle?
[208:17.15]I was.
[208:17.85]Very clearly.
[208:19.17]Take a look.
[208:20.09]Alright.
[208:20.63]I want you to just take a look at that and tell me that's not in the circle.
[208:28.58]Would you constitute that as like being in the circle?
[208:34.62]Or would you say that's out of the circle?
[208:37.26]I gotta enhance.
[208:38.43]I did that too.
[208:40.85]Hold on one second.
[208:42.35]That
[208:43.96]You're on, like, the... The outline of the circle is definitely not inside the circle, though.
[208:51.86]That still should be a plus.
[208:55.16]Like, you did it.
[208:56.32]That should be an acceptable... Hey, did you know that I haven't missed a circle yet with my thumbsticks?
[209:01.97]On a controller?
[209:02.83]Yeah, because you're console aiming.
[209:04.31]I'm on the hard one.
[209:05.39]I'm on PC.
[209:07.23]You have auto-aim assist on console.
[209:08.85]I don't have that.
[209:10.39]Hey, there's no aim assist.
[209:13.82]All console controller gaming has aim assist.
[209:16.14]Of course it does.
[209:18.56]I'm doing it eye-to-eye, one-to-one.
[209:20.34]Eye tracking is hard.
[209:22.72]Anyways, hold on.
[209:23.14]Give me one sec.
[209:25.41]Somebody gave 50 bucks.
[209:27.97]Who just gave 5,000 bits?
[209:29.03]Is this PUBG mobile gamer really going to lecture me on auto-aim?
[209:32.91]He doesn't know.
[209:33.33]He's muted.
[209:36.23]Who just gave 5,000 bits?
[209:37.31]I missed it.
[209:38.01]It's not showing up anywhere.
[209:41.69]Hold on.
[209:48.07]Wait, there's a straw poll about this?
[209:52.07]What does it say?
[209:55.08]Uh, there's a straw poll.
[209:56.10]66% said I missed, 34% said I didn't miss.
[210:01.46]Well, I think those are pretty good, considering.
[210:03.82]33%, um, or 30, however many.
[210:10.69]Yeah, that's a lot of, uh, that's a lot of suck-ups.
[210:16.77]You do realize this is Twitch chat.
[210:19.27]If this was accurate... Yeah, but I'm with the majority, so I chose correctly.
[210:23.34]But if this were truly... 66% have my back, and like 34% have yours, so I'll take those odds.
[210:28.74]Yeah, but if this was truly Twitch chat and I truly missed, wouldn't it be like 5% no?
[210:36.16]Wouldn't everybody be like, oh yeah, he fucking missed.
[210:38.10]Fuck this guy.
[210:38.92]It sucks.
[210:41.15]That's what I think would happen.
[210:42.67]They just want to be noticed.
[210:45.19]Alright, there was a huge donation and I don't see it anywhere.
[210:48.47]I don't know why.
[210:48.89]Well, they definitely want to be noticed.
[210:53.80]Why can't I see this?
[210:56.48]I'll catch you at the end of the stream.
[210:57.94]I don't know why I can't see it anywhere.
[210:59.56]He didn't notice you.
[211:00.36]Was it fake money?
[211:01.06]Alright, you ready?
[211:03.12]Ready to get back into this?
[211:03.98]I am ready.
[211:05.20]You do ready first, like we said before.
[211:09.62]There we go.
[211:10.36]Perfect.
[211:11.24]Beautiful.
[211:12.48]Alright, let's go.
[211:13.86]Three, two, one, action.
[211:23.71]Keep a lookout for the girl.
[211:25.71]We have to stop her.
[211:26.79]Did you pee on the toilet room and say you hit inside the bowl?
[211:29.49]We're all getting taken out.
[211:30.69]Only a matter of time.
[211:32.07]Keep your eyes and ears open.
[211:33.39]There's another path here if you wanted it.
[211:36.20]Another path?
[211:37.38]Wait, who are you?
[211:38.40]I'm John.
[211:39.61]Oh yeah, there was another path.
[211:42.62]They may go the same way.
[211:43.54]Uh, there's three of us here.
[211:50.04]Who are you?
[211:53.14]Hang on, hang on.
[211:53.86]Pause the game.
[211:54.82]What?
[211:56.78]I still have your circle as like an enhanced image.
[212:00.50]I have to alt-tab to change the scene.
[212:03.23]And then, yeah, okay.
[212:04.65]Alright, let's move.
[212:18.11]Dude, I got this iced tea from Target.
[212:21.01]It's the greatest shit ever.
[212:23.87]It's like iced tea concentrate.
[212:32.28]It's like my favorite thing on Earth.
[212:40.54]You need to dilute it.
[212:42.70]No, I do, yeah.
[212:43.33]You do 50-50 water.
[212:45.27]It's, uh, what, the Tazo tea?
[212:47.63]There's a passion fruit and there's a green peach.
[212:51.19]You do 50-50 into water.
[212:52.71]Oh, it's unbelievable.
[212:53.73]It's the best.
[212:54.47]It's great.
[212:57.63]Dangerous, unstable structure ahead.
[212:59.35]There's a lot of fireflies around this mystical door.
[213:09.20]Yeah, there is, isn't there?
[213:11.50]Yeah, unstable structure.
[213:21.41]Don't go towards the light.
[213:26.67]Yeah, that's when your eyes are glazed over and you're under a spell.
[213:31.21]Lore grab.
[213:32.61]Sick.
[213:37.35]Dude, that was a lore grab out of nowhere.
[213:42.59]Play his fucking entrance music.
[213:45.53]But I must speak with you.
[213:47.25]What ails you, my friend?
[213:48.29]Goku instant transmission.
[213:51.09]I am troubled by her.
[213:52.71]By the part she has played in these trials.
[213:54.99]Those trials trouble us all.
[213:56.73]There is more to this.
[213:58.48]I saw her smile as her own sister was executed.
[214:02.52]She took pleasure from it.
[214:03.60]Are you certain?
[214:05.20]I am.
[214:06.86]But now that she speaks of guilt and remorse, it is hard not to believe her.
[214:13.62]Keep away from her, Abraham.
[214:15.66]No good can come from being with that child.
[214:17.42]Too late.
[214:19.18]With her brother and sister gone, Mary now lives under my roof.
[214:24.56]Your charity places you in grave danger.
[214:27.27]What do you advise?
[214:30.87]Tell the court you suspect she toys with us all.
[214:32.69]That you saw her delight in her own sister's death.
[214:35.57]I implore you.
[214:37.17]I am torn.
[214:39.09]Mary seems full of remorse.
[214:40.30]Keep your suspicions to yourself, and it's our community which will suffer.
[214:48.56]Why take out Mary and not the guy listening to her?
[214:51.25]We were just standing over there, by the way.
[214:53.79]I thought this was supposed to be us.
[214:55.93]Wait, why are we just standing?
[214:57.97]Yeah, but why are we so weirdly standing?
[215:02.30]Unless we're doing the...
[215:06.12]The nightmare before Christmas.
[215:07.68]Yeah, I was gonna say the same thing.
[215:08.64]Every swear word combined.
[215:36.24]Screaming as loud as you can.
[215:37.66]Oh, fuck.
[215:38.12]What do we do?
[215:47.43]This kid can't be guilty of anything.
[215:49.27]It's preposterous.
[215:50.87]She's not old enough to know right from wrong, let alone what witchcraft is.
[215:55.43]The devil has sent you to tempt me.
[215:58.49]I must not succumb.
[216:00.29]Little Hope is no longer the town I knew.
[216:03.15]Strange and disturbing events have become commonplace.
[216:06.69]It's a little too late.
[216:07.49]You, whatever you are, are but one of these.
[216:12.29]Revealing the truth about Mary may save my friend, but it does not sit easily with me that in doing so I condemn a child.
[216:24.85]Putting it all on a kid isn't right.
[216:26.73]The priest is the one driving this whole thing.
[216:29.69]Reverend Carver is a man guided by God.
[216:33.04]No one can doubt that.
[216:36.60]I support you.
[216:39.12]Cooperate.
[216:46.34]I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
[216:50.03]Nothing here makes sense.
[216:55.63]Hi, Taylor.
[216:56.03]Nice of you to join us.
[216:57.53]Nice of you to show up.
[216:59.54]Bye.
[217:01.08]Enter stage left.
[217:02.58]Maybe we'll see him again.
[217:04.34]Get him to change his mind.
[217:07.58]I made the right call.
[217:09.32]I have no doubts.
[217:10.28]Yeah, we did.
[217:12.25]You made the right call.
[217:13.13]I made the right call.
[217:13.89]We both made the right call.
[217:16.65]Apparently not.
[217:21.39]This girl has been grabbed around the neck by this monster.
[217:25.10]Three or four times.
[217:27.62]Wait, do we just not get to do anything?
[217:29.42]Is Taylor just dying?
[217:31.34]Oh, one pixel.
[217:31.76]Always trust your ears.
[217:32.58]Trust your ears.
[217:33.90]Always not movement.
[217:39.80]Your eyes deceive you.
[217:43.22]Your ears do not.
[217:54.77]Father, can you hear me?
[217:55.77]Say something!
[217:58.34]John!
[218:07.82]You alright?
[218:09.65]I'm over here.
[218:10.31]I found you.
[218:11.93]I got you.
[218:12.75]Just hold on to me.
[218:15.45]Remember, follow your nose.
[218:17.11]The Froot Loops.
[218:20.37]Green apple, cherry, and strawberry.
[218:25.22]Dialog choice there.
[218:32.67]That was pretty weak.
[218:35.75]Yeah, that was pretty limp.
[218:38.43]That thing better have been really heavy.
[218:44.43]This poor girl.
[218:45.47]Seriously, this is like the fourth or fifth time that she gets like smoker'd from Left 4 Dead.
[218:52.37]Yeah, like, fucking kick this lady from the lobby.
[218:55.09]No, boot her from the lobby, man.
[218:58.45]You keep getting grabbed by special-infecteds.
[218:59.97]Fuck outta here.
[219:01.65]I wanna get to the first safe house.
[219:02.93]Alright, now I'm John.
[219:10.59]I am Andrew.
[219:18.36]Honestly, after this many times, it's probably not even scary for her anymore.
[219:23.85]Well, but that's her, right?
[219:25.31]So that's why it keeps doing it.
[219:26.61]That's a her.
[219:28.01]Yeah.
[219:28.53]Got me to claim her.
[219:33.91]Weird looking tree over here.
[219:34.81]No, I'm going to look at the tree.
[219:38.20]It's got the stick bug symbol on it.
[219:42.90]Okay.
[219:48.40]She's not even playable anymore?
[219:51.62]Yeah, she's kind of not.
[219:56.38]we have to go down or back to the road yeah you coming or not whatever that thing was I was about to ask where Daniel was and I just remembered Daniel is in a better place what went on back there no clue
[220:24.31]Whatever we saw back there or thought we saw, we're still in grave danger.
[220:33.38]You've killed everyone.
[220:34.28]Everyone is two.
[220:37.28]There must be something we can do.
[220:39.97]Mary's in the middle of all this, that I'm certain of.
[220:46.83]But what if it doesn't work?
[220:53.31]We don't know for sure that stopping Mary will help us out.
[220:57.51]It's just a theory.
[221:05.68]It may only be a theory, but right now it's all we've got.
[221:08.44]Come on.
[221:09.32]Let's take a look.
[221:10.24]You know, if I said that, I would have gotten -2 for sure.
[221:13.76]Alright.
[221:14.16]Well, those were the two more peaceful options.
[221:18.96]Yeah, those are peaceful.
[221:27.80]Oh, chiropractor.
[221:31.42]Hey, uh, dude, hey, lock door.
[221:33.06]Can't wait to see the locked door and climb through the window.
[221:35.02]Sorry, I was just watching my character's death.
[221:38.70]You know what's really funny?
[221:40.41]You're the one that's seeing all the ways to prevent the deaths, and I'm the one that's dying.
[221:45.11]It's really not, like, they don't tell me what QTE I'm gonna have to push.
[221:48.85]It's just a visual of them actually dying, but it's nice to know that they come true, because then you control the character.
[221:57.03]Yeah, so it comes through.
[221:59.93]The ink is already written.
[222:01.09]It's dry.
[222:02.23]I'm not doing anything wrong.
[222:03.43]You are seeing the future.
[222:05.55]Can't be prevented.
[222:06.31]It's already happened.
[222:14.00]Carver for mayor.
[222:15.52]By the way, if you're curious, I get choked out.
[222:19.48]Really?
[222:21.68]Wait, choked out by the monster tongue thing?
[222:24.12]By a new monster.
[222:25.84]Oh.
[222:33.91]going upstairs so there is like a dramatic irony in that John was the character we predicted to die first and he may be the only character that survives that's true hey up here I don't know Dave state
[223:06.44]He's back.
[223:06.88]Okay.
[223:10.03]Uh... We're probably... We're, like, in some weird...
[223:22.78]I mean, in this guy's defense, we've just been going around the old town, breaking into every single building and, like, messing shit up.
[223:31.51]Probably call the police.
[223:32.97]Make sure they'll find you.
[223:34.19]I don't think he's talking about the monsters.
[223:35.62]We're probably just in some weird purgatory world where we'll face him in and out.
[223:43.86]Timing.
[223:44.54]Now is my time to speak before the judge.
[223:47.13]Maybe we're finally getting somewhere.
[223:49.82]I am filled with dread.
[223:52.12]I cannot know how my testimony will be received.
[223:55.94]The devil has blinded so many to what is real and what is not.
[224:00.51]I love this putting on the accent acting.
[224:03.33]Allow me to judge what is true.
[224:07.90]Abraham and Joseph are allies in this deception.
[224:10.68]And lest we forget, you condemned Joseph to death only yesterday.
[224:12.88]He does sound like John Snow.
[224:14.43]Or do you now question that decision?
[224:16.79]I have heard nothing today to sway my conviction.
[224:19.29]Joseph consorted with the same malicious force as his wife.
[224:23.29]Uh, that's because Sean Bean's accent was so good, they told all the other actors to imitate him, and that's why everyone on Game of Thrones sounded like that.
[224:30.07]That's real?
[224:31.93]Yeah.
[224:33.03]That's real?
[224:34.43]It was Sean Bean's real accent.
[224:36.18]Damn, imagine being that good of an actor, and you tell every other fucking actor they're not good enough, be more like Sean Bean.
[224:45.72]Damn.
[224:51.74]Yet her reward for exposing this brooding covered in our midst is to be besmirched.
[224:55.70]And courage is not in question.
[224:57.94]It is her intent we must be certain of.
[225:01.26]Her accuser is the very man entrusted to care for this innocent child.
[225:05.78]Plain to see he is not fit for such a task.
[225:08.77]And I would ask the court to have Mary placed elsewhere.
[225:12.39]So Andrew double agreed to... Throw the kid under the bus?
[225:17.17]I guess.
[225:17.33]If the court agrees...
[225:22.20]First, the court must hear what Abraham has to say.
[225:24.40]No decision can be made on the child until then.
[225:32.72]Abraham.
[225:37.74]What am I to do?
[225:39.80]Some would have me speak out against Mary, but could a child truly be capable of such evil?
[225:45.25]Sorry, I don't know what you... Oh, God.
[225:48.14]I feel like we're getting trick question every time.
[225:52.76]I understand your dilemma.
[225:54.88]The consequences couldn't be more serious, but the girl is so young.
[226:03.97]Such evil.
[226:06.59]No.
[226:06.77]Tell the court what you have come here to say.
[226:09.43]She's my queen.
[226:10.11]Speak up, boy.
[226:12.05]No.
[226:12.67]Out with it.
[226:14.79]Mary has spoken of evil spirits.
[226:17.56]Devilry and witchcraft.
[226:18.70]I don't want it.
[226:19.90]Things many cannot believe could exist here in Little Hall.
[226:22.66]I'm not here for history and hearsay.
[226:24.38]Get to the point, boy.
[226:25.54]Thanos.
[226:26.30]Thanos.
[226:26.96]Mary is tormented.
[226:28.61]Don't want it.
[226:29.51]I really was kind of a Thanos there.
[226:32.71]Stolen her innocence.
[226:35.45]Some suggest she is in league with these creatures, but no one can be certain.
[226:39.45]Myself least of all.
[226:41.53]Can any of us truly know a child's mind?
[226:45.56]I thought that was you talking.
[226:47.02]I swear to God, I thought that was you doing that.
[226:48.38]This is you talking.
[227:13.41]That really did sound like you putting on, like, doing a voice.
[227:18.05]And he just kind of turned into that.
[227:19.13]That was weird.
[227:19.63]I can't believe we have the actor for Judge Varian Wrynn, whatever his name was, here.
[227:25.25]Um...
[227:35.86]I mean, I have to do this one.
[227:37.90]This helps us.
[227:39.30]Has to.
[227:40.55]We now know for sure that we can alter what happens.
[227:43.07]True.
[227:43.63]Seriously?
[227:45.23]We can change the friggin' past?
[227:48.81]Not cool.
[227:49.39]This sucks.
[227:51.43]I don't know.
[227:51.79]The dude yelling at us in all caps, BE COOPERATIVE, COOPERATE, has got me like... Okay.
[227:59.14]Looks like we can make a difference, but we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves.
[228:03.70]We are flip-flopping so much it's unbelievable.
[228:08.15]Okay.
[228:09.17]Explore the factory.
[228:35.24]Bounce up.
[228:36.50]I found something.
[228:38.70]I remember my dad in pants like that.
[228:41.64]Memory of James Clark.
[228:44.38]The guy in the town on the left.
[228:46.01]It's a weird comment.
[229:04.05]Just go kill Hitler.
[229:09.53]Guys, we can alter the past!
[229:11.56]Fuck this, like, dumb Salem witch trial shit, let's go kill Hitler!
[229:15.42]Uh, unfortunately, we would need some kind of, like, demon Hitler to grab our arm to take us back to that- Whoa!
[229:26.15]I'm sorry, I can't explain what just happened.
[229:28.13]What'd you do?
[229:31.47]A video game bug spirit just yanked me about 10 feet backward.
[229:36.82]I spoke Demon Hitler's name and he pushed me, dude.
[229:40.02]I'll push from this end.
[229:41.04]Was it a log grab or was it a... No, it was like a bug grab.
[229:45.34]Oh, shit.
[229:45.66]Everything you got.
[229:46.34]Nice fall joke.
[229:58.55]That on purpose.
[230:04.78]Why'd you do that to me?
[230:07.08]I was looking at... Lore.
[230:13.06]I just pressed a button.
[230:19.26]He looks really- Yeah, but why- We have not been able to control Taylor for the last... 40 minutes.
[230:25.37]There's like a crypt down here.
[230:28.67]You guys can't reach a stick down and like... Both work together to pick me up or something?
[230:34.59]So you're John right now, right?
[230:36.65]I don't know.
[230:38.39]So find out in a second.
[230:39.75]I'm watching Andrew right now.
[230:41.45]Yeah, maybe this is both of us.
[230:43.04]Someone's going to get a co-op partner and someone's not.
[230:51.60]Or maybe we're just these two people.
[230:54.24]Oh, let's see.
[230:54.92]It looks like it's changing scenes.
[231:01.81]Are you here with me as Andrew or Taylor?
[231:04.29]I just switched back to John, I think.
[231:05.93]Okay.
[231:06.35]Well, let's go ahead and mute those mics.
[231:10.43]Thank God I have the co-op partner because I'm the one that needs all the help.
[231:15.88]Professor?
[231:16.42]Hope you're okay.
[231:25.96]It's a chance for you to kill two more people.
[231:28.88]Okay.
[231:31.09]How funny would it be if Vitalix just randomly, with the mics muted, gets like a game over on his screen because these two are dead and he's the last one.
[231:45.20]Imagine the disappointment.
[231:46.18]Four out of four dead from me.
[231:57.76]Now, he has to be responsible for somebody dying.
[231:59.70]You know what I mean?
[232:01.02]He's gonna fuck up a QT.
[232:01.86]He's gonna fall down a hill.
[232:05.23]What'd you do?
[232:07.09]What was the purpose of that?
[232:08.27]Yeah, there was no point.
[232:09.01]You just went down and we went up.
[232:10.15]I saw the little girl on a bridge and that was it.
[232:12.89]Same here.
[232:14.47]Literally it.
[232:17.85]Great.
[232:18.73]Here comes... A hunter.
[232:25.01]That dude was just looking at us.
[232:26.30]Hunter.
[232:27.44]Where did you guys come from?
[232:29.82]We just walked over.
[232:34.56]Somebody said, oh no, it's Hitler.
[232:36.84]That's not how this works.
[232:43.00]Somebody put witchcraft on this car.
[232:47.73]I hope somebody law grabs me out of the trunk.
[232:50.91]Damn it.
[232:53.13]Oh, I found the little girl again.
[232:55.42]You keep seeing the little girl.
[232:57.40]Don't shine your flashlight at her.
[232:59.56]She's waiting for her cue.
[233:04.53]Okay, okay, careful.
[233:05.47]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[233:07.35]Freeze.
[233:08.85]Look to your left and then walk towards me slowly.
[233:11.41]No, your other left!
[233:13.54]You said left.
[233:15.20]You turned right!
[233:16.06]What?
[233:17.26]What are you talking about?
[233:21.16]Turn left and walk towards John.
[233:24.83]I did turn left.
[233:25.99]Turn left and walk towards John.
[233:28.53]My left?
[233:30.01]The character's left.
[233:31.15]How would I know which way your camera's facing?
[233:33.93]That's what I did.
[233:35.77]You're just standing there.
[233:38.40]Walk towards John.
[233:39.48]Okay, now, without turning the camera, look behind you.
[233:44.52]How do I look behind me without turning the camera?
[233:46.90]Okay, well, turn the camera, but don't turn your character.
[233:49.34]Oh, that's what I was doing, and you screamed at me.
[233:51.54]Yeah, because you've shown the flashlight right at it.
[233:55.25]I don't see anything.
[233:55.75]Do you see the little girl?
[233:56.99]No.
[233:58.03]She's standing past the picket fence.
[234:04.72]You don't see her?
[234:05.44]No.
[234:06.38]Okay, walk towards the fence, then, and let's see what happens.
[234:10.29]Okay, behind you.
[234:13.42]Wait, your camera is behind you.
[234:15.34]Face your character the way my character's facing, but... Oh my god.
[234:17.74]What are you talking about?
[234:19.26]You play don't talk or somebody explodes the game.
[234:22.69]I'm seeing... Okay, come on.
[234:24.65]Okay.
[234:26.03]You're looking over here.
[234:27.75]You're looking straight this way.
[234:29.15]There's no little girl.
[234:30.65]Right.
[234:31.07]Turn the camera around because if you shine the flashlight at her, she's going to freak out.
[234:36.00]She's in the other opposite direction.
[234:40.82]She's this way.
[234:42.14]But I'm trying not to shine my flashlight.
[234:44.52]Oh, okay, she's past that fence.
[234:46.60]Okay, I see her.
[234:46.94]Yeah, I'm trying to avoid the trigger that happens when we inadvertently walk up to it.
[234:51.20]I thought you were talking about over this fence that we're standing in front of.
[234:55.53]Yeah, I'm just wondering how long is she going to stand there waiting for us to do a spook?
[235:02.47]Let's sneak up on her.
[235:04.74]Oh, never mind.
[235:06.24]In the fog there.
[235:08.63]Did you see that?
[235:09.41]See?
[235:09.73]That's what I... Cooperate.
[235:19.33]Alright, so is this girl real?
[235:24.71]Is this girl real in real life here in our timeline?
[235:27.35]There's one in this timeline and one in like the 300 years ago timeline.
[235:30.56]Alright, but like who the fuck is this girl?
[235:32.46]This is the current timeline one.
[235:33.76]That's the moral one.
[235:35.36]Okay, so there's three of them.
[235:38.68]The lore one is the old time one, I think.
[235:41.68]Yeah, it's torture.
[235:42.64]Why do you use rocks?
[235:43.62]Why doesn't everyone in town just dogpile on top of them?
[235:47.18]Why don't you just drop the rock on his head?
[235:49.08]No one is safe!
[236:05.38]Joseph, do you renounce the devil and all his teachings?
[236:11.24]I carry no sin.
[236:13.48]I'm no disciple of the devil.
[236:17.18]Our town is infested with madness.
[236:22.53]I who?
[236:26.51]We have to stop this.
[236:27.69]Uh-oh.
[236:31.23]What the fuck?
[236:34.14]Just listen to me, listen to me, give me that doll!
[236:44.51]You give me that!
[236:45.25]Look!
[236:46.47]See how this poor child is tormented?
[236:48.93]Joseph still clutches her with the devil's hand!
[236:52.63]More stones!
[236:54.46]The devil must be crushed from within him!
[237:00.44]Do not flinch.
[237:02.10]The fate of the floor rests in your hands.
[237:04.18]The reverend is in on it.
[237:05.82]He's the actual witch guy.
[237:15.13]Look, okay, if I had walked over there and lifted... I could have lifted the rocks up.
[237:18.71]They would float and it'd be like, oh, it's the Satan and she's doing that.
[237:25.30]The rocks would be floating around.
[237:29.14]And it would be even worse.
[237:31.31]I'm just trying to get the fucking doll out of her hand.
[237:35.07]It's new monster time.
[237:36.41]Alright, have we considered, like, tying a rope around our waists so we don't get lost, separated, or you're yanked?
[237:55.57]Have we considered spelling out shit in the dirt with a rock that just says, like, Satan?
[238:00.73]We're not Satan.
[238:01.73]We can't get away from this thing.
[238:04.19]I'm not letting what happened to Daniel happen to me.
[238:06.43]Are you crazy?
[238:08.27]We gotta move.
[238:08.95]Where'd you get the sledgehammer?
[238:10.63]Come on, get away from there.
[238:11.87]Please, move your ass.
[238:18.14]Oh, my God.
[238:18.88]They almost got me with that one.
[238:24.28]They moved the circle.
[238:27.74]Why am I standing here?
[238:32.80]Hey, do you want to do anything about this?
[238:35.27]Or do I have a chance?
[238:42.53]That's okay.
[238:43.23]I'm handling this one.
[238:44.27]Alright, I'm coming.
[238:50.19]My character decided to do something.
[238:53.78]I swear to God, I swear to God.
[238:56.48]Fuck UTEs, what year are we?
[238:57.54]Come on.
[238:58.54]This is like 2001.
[239:23.49]Okay, how many in a row do I have to do?
[239:29.48]Don't worry, fuck the QTEs, I can tap faster than anybody.
[239:34.48]Your foot is in the air waiting to kick him in the face.
[239:36.90]We just had to load your foot.
[239:39.86]I can't get this wrong.
[239:51.28]What the f- Did you hear how fast I was trying to move the mouse?
[239:59.21]You have no idea!
[240:03.40]Are you serious?
[240:08.48]Please tell me you heard me 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with the f-ing mouse.
[240:16.05]That was a- that was a- I can't fucking believe that!
[240:19.47]I can't fucking believe it!
[240:23.06]You heard it!
[240:24.06]You all had to have heard it!
[240:26.28]I can't be held responsible!
[240:27.28]That's exactly what I saw!
[240:28.36]Alright, okay, listen.
[240:30.38]Can we pause the game for just a second?
[240:31.88]This is great.
[240:33.42]Don't pause, nevermind.
[240:39.85]Did you go all for three there?
[240:43.15]Dude, you have no idea.
[240:44.69]I tried so hard.
[240:45.87]Oh, my stomach.
[240:47.23]Listen.
[240:59.73]I had one last chance to undo that fuck up.
[241:04.87]But they switched the QTE type on me at the last second.
[241:08.45]And I missed the last one because I had four in a row of move the thumbstick and hit the crosshair.
[241:15.45]And then on the last one, they switched it to push X. So if you try to move the thumbstick, that counts as a button.
[241:23.56]And it invalidates.
[241:25.60]So I was like...
[241:27.94]And what happened at the end for there, man, I had to do not one, not two, not three, but four full wrists across my entire mousepad.
[241:38.32]And I didn't even get halfway.
[241:39.74]You know what I did?
[241:40.26]I just moved my thumb to the left and right.
[241:42.56]Controller, baby.
[241:44.68]Should I plug a controller in right now?
[241:52.66]Alright, pause it, pause it, pause it.
[241:54.33]I need a second.
[241:55.25]That was so stupid.
[241:56.85]That, it was...
[242:00.71]Un-fucking-believable.
[242:02.05]Let me just plug a goddamn controller.
[242:04.01]But, here's the thing, I don't move the mouse.
[242:06.09]You can't even do it, because it asks you if you want to use a controller or a keyboard.
[242:09.34]We'd have to, like, go back to menu.
[242:10.94]At this point, what's the point?
[242:12.76]Shit.
[242:14.18]Yeah, it's, what's the point?
[242:16.14]We got, like, fucking, maybe... Listen, everybody, Jerma just didn't want to do a fuckface run after this, so he's just trying to make the first one the fuckface run.
[242:25.03]That way we do both of them at the same time.
[242:31.58]My chest is killing me.
[242:33.00]That was too fucking funny.
[242:34.36]It was so stupid.
[242:36.44]Alright.
[242:40.63]Should I use the controller or what do you think?
[242:43.07]Alex, you be the judge.
[242:45.01]At this point, I mean, you know what to expect with the mouse and keyboard.
[242:48.10]Okay.
[242:49.65]That's true.
[242:50.97]I don't know.
[242:51.56]If you switch to a controller, you've got to like... You've got to relearn.
[242:54.48]That's true.
[242:55.94]By the way, somebody said it was six times.
[242:57.86]It was six full across the whole mousepad.
[243:00.85]Wait, you missed six in a row?
[243:02.75]No, no, okay, I had to bring my mouse across the screen into the target to click and hit with the sledgehammer.
[243:11.90]But, for some reason, the mouse sensitivity was so obscenely slow, and I have no idea why, I had to do one, two, three, four, five, six across the whole mousepad to get it halfway.
[243:25.73]I have no idea, it was fucking outrageous.
[243:31.58]Let me look, hold on.
[243:33.98]Controls.
[243:35.06]Yeah, dude, my mouse sensitivity is fucking 50.
[243:37.23]It's huge.
[243:41.13]That's just the default.
[243:42.01]Well, I don't need to change that.
[243:44.09]Alright, we're just gonna go.
[243:45.41]Whatever.
[243:45.91]I've already known.
[243:46.65]Let's go.
[243:47.83]Alright, me first.
[243:52.50]Oh my god.
[243:53.10]I'm gonna have to take a bath after this shit.
[244:01.54]Okay, let's go.
[244:04.64]No, I didn't.
[244:05.49]If I hit the DPI button, this would be different.
[244:07.91]This has not changed at all.
[244:16.21]Why do I have to be three for three for killing everybody?
[244:18.16]It's not fair.
[244:20.22]How would I know that there's anything on this wall?
[244:26.60]they don't notice me at all they don't care see I told you guys that was the key line you were right beginning of the game that actually that's exactly what you said I'm gonna have to give you credit wait did you hear what I just heard yeah I'm currently stuck staring out of a window but did you hear like the little girl's voice yes I did I'm I can't get out of the window are we in the same room
[244:54.56]I'm looking at like a grandfather clock with a key in it.
[245:00.08]Can you come like bump me?
[245:01.48]Can you come like grab me by the back or something?
[245:03.38]I can't move.
[245:03.93]Hold on.
[245:04.55]There's a key in here.
[245:08.63]Take the key.
[245:10.91]Take the key.
[245:13.15]Okay, I got out.
[245:16.84]I can't take the key.
[245:18.76]No, I fucking just walked over.
[245:20.02]Do I need to come bump you?
[245:20.88]Fuck.
[245:31.21]You're supposed to scare me.
[245:34.83]Me?
[245:35.59]No, no.
[245:37.01]I can't even explain.
[245:37.85]It was just fucking stupid.
[245:39.46]Alright, it didn't work.
[245:55.58]I'm gonna come to you because I think my game is starting to fucking attack itself.
[246:15.88]successful parenting okay I think this is like a reverend reverend's cursing little girls with witchcraft through time the game based on that lore I can't get over it it's too stupid hi
[246:34.69]People are spamming right now.
[246:35.87]They say, on my first playthrough, all of my characters survived, even though I wasn't trying very hard to keep them alive.
[246:43.88]That's from IGN.
[246:46.00]Whatever.
[246:46.46]Wait, IGN said that?
[246:47.82]Yeah.
[246:48.16]IGN gave this game a 5, by the way.
[246:50.96]They were probably playing with a controller.
[246:52.42]Probably were.
[246:53.16]I'm sure they were.
[247:02.57]James and Anne.
[247:08.78]Wait, where are we?
[247:12.76]How many different timelines are there?
[247:14.94]Yeah, me too.
[247:16.10]But I can go upstairs and it might yoink.
[247:18.06]Let's go.
[247:18.98]Maybe it'll yoink us?
[247:20.40]Yeah.
[247:24.93]You hear that?
[247:25.93]Yep.
[247:26.81]Gotta be that kid upstairs.
[247:28.99]We have to go find her.
[247:30.83]Well, this is the house that burned down.
[247:32.47]So, why did we burn down here and then get in a car accident?
[247:36.69]And then teleport back to the year, like, 1600.
[247:38.27]I'm chewing ice.
[247:51.60]Well, I just broke a tooth.
[247:52.92]All my teeth in the back are gone.
[248:03.40]I think we're about to get Lord grabbed Nice it's so yeah, you got it This isn't right no way
[248:23.49]I assure all gathered here today that our town will be free of the devil's grasp.
[248:27.41]This place burns down.
[248:28.37]Together, by God's grace, little hope will prevail.
[248:31.99]My word on it.
[248:33.35]This court is hastily convened, but with good reason.
[248:37.54]If we are to finally rid ourselves of the evil which has infested little hope, then we must act today.
[248:44.60]I accuse you, Mary, of witchcraft.
[248:48.78]What say you, Reverend?
[248:50.66]We've got to save her.
[248:53.04]The evidence, as discovered through my investigation, is beyond question.
[248:56.26]Dude, hitman this shit.
[248:57.24]Drop the chandelier on him right now.
[249:02.26]We have been deceived by a child by her guise of innocence.
[249:06.74]This puppet was mistakenly used to denounce Tabitha.
[249:10.14]Oops, we killed her.
[249:10.59]Too bad.
[249:11.37]But it has always belonged to Mary and Mary alone.
[249:15.47]She allowed her own kin to be executed as she watched in silence.
[249:19.93]That is not so.
[249:21.54]Liar.
[249:22.10]Now this tainted child, this creature of Satan has the marrow to accuse me, a man of God, of wrongdoing.
[249:28.48]Oh, this guy.
[249:32.33]Uh, neither of my options are good.
[249:34.05]This is crazy.
[249:35.33]These people have lost their freaking minds.
[249:37.77]It was never my intention to bring her up to this town or its people.
[249:42.04]Can you not help me?
[249:43.02]What can I do?
[249:43.84]Help.
[249:45.44]If I could do something to stop this, I would, but now in her hour of greatest need, this child of the damned pleads once more for the devil's help.
[249:54.85]Oh, wait.
[249:55.33]I beg your court's indulgence.
[249:57.11]We convinced him to step in.
[249:59.23]Please guide me at this time.
[250:01.69]Now they're both gonna die.
[250:03.16]Oh shit.
[250:04.56]Carver is evil.
[250:05.54]Carver's the priest, right?
[250:06.50]Is Carver the priest?
[250:07.08]Is Alex?
[250:07.34]Is Carver the priest?
[250:07.86]Yeah, I think so.
[250:08.74]Got him.
[250:09.76]We have to stop this.
[250:11.74]The only madness is right here in this court.
[250:13.95]Carver, he's the evil one.
[250:16.31]We have been swayed by malice.
[250:19.13]The truth hidden from us, but not by Mary.
[250:23.53]Reverend Carver is the one urging us to believe in the devil.
[250:27.36]Be silent.
[250:28.20]This is all his doing.
[250:29.08]You'll not deceive us any longer.
[250:30.50]Your true purpose is plain to see.
[250:33.42]I will see this town purged of all evil.
[250:38.82]Better go for him.
[250:39.38]He's right.
[250:40.32]Listen to him.
[250:41.02]Carver is the guilty one.
[250:42.76]What must I do to bring Little Hope back into the line?
[250:46.03]Um... Fear the Reverend.
[250:47.67]I guess burn down the whole church.
[250:49.17]Destroy the doll?
[250:51.29]Or... You have to stop Carver.
[250:54.52]Stop Carver!
[250:56.32]Stop Carver!
[250:58.18]Stop Carver!
[250:58.72]You have to stop Carver.
[251:00.89]It's him, don't you get it?
[251:02.67]He's condemning Mary to take the heat off himself.
[251:05.31]Do nothing.
[251:06.61]I swear to God, if he shoots himself in the head, that doesn't count.
[251:19.32]What's the meaning of this outrage?
[251:28.15]This is a centrist run.
[251:30.65]What I have just learned sickens me to my core.
[251:33.95]What did you just learn?
[251:35.25]There are serious questions which must be asked of you.
[251:39.11]What would he say?
[251:41.85]Look in the first page of his Bible.
[251:43.72]How can a man of God conduct himself in such a way?
[251:46.96]Those are just doodles.
[251:48.36]Those are doodles of my math homework.
[251:50.30]Fucking bullshit.
[251:52.12]You are free to leave.
[251:54.40]Fool!
[251:55.94]Misled by a child!
[251:58.09]Do you not see what she is?
[252:00.69]I was just bored during the last sermon, so I do my favorite Dragon Ball Z characters.
[252:04.43]The devil's daughter has deceived you all.
[252:06.33]Dude, I feel that.
[252:06.95]I used to draw Diablo II items.
[252:08.91]I see her.
[252:10.45]I see her.
[252:12.15]Satan's whore.
[252:14.16]You will pay heavily for your crimes.
[252:17.44]He doodled in his Bible?
[252:19.12]Jesus.
[252:19.40]Now all of Little Hope is mesmerized by you.
[252:24.63]How did we know that his... We didn't know that.
[252:32.24]We had no idea.
[252:33.36]That's info that past Andrew had, I guess.
[252:37.16]But why wouldn't he immediately act on that if he knew that?
[252:41.24]Wait, what?
[252:52.84]Still killed three people.
[252:54.14]It was dead fucking weak.
[252:56.38]Yeah, no, I looked in the Bible, but old-timey Andrew didn't look in the Bible.
[253:06.68]Yeah.
[253:09.41]I mean, I should feel great.
[253:13.05]But I don't.
[253:14.33]I feel nothing.
[253:17.53]Come on.
[253:19.03]Let's get out of here.
[253:20.24]How do we get out of here?
[253:21.46]Don't we just walk around in a circle?
[253:22.56]Or is the curse lifted?
[253:28.41]Did he just storm out?
[253:29.43]I don't think he's dead yet.
[253:30.73]Right?
[253:30.91]The priest?
[253:33.23]Yeah, but I... Alright, so the house in the beginning is supposed to be... He whispered the script into his ear.
[253:54.75]Wait, what's going on?
[253:57.83]Are you trapped in there?
[253:58.93]Hey, is this giving you any flashbacks?
[254:04.71]Am I going to catch fire in a second?
[254:07.21]No, didn't you hang?
[254:11.45]Someone's behind me.
[254:14.75]Oh, here I go, getting grabbed by the smoker again.
[254:22.57]Wait, you just died?
[254:28.21]Why did you just die?
[254:30.05]Because I wasn't nice enough in real, in my life.
[254:34.43]I was indecisive and abrasive or whatever.
[254:45.22]We're being judged.
[254:47.56]What, what about Andrew?
[254:49.06]I don't think I, did we do anything bad as Taylor?
[254:52.39]You were Taylor, right?
[254:53.23]I mean, I called somebody a dick, like, in the beginning of the game.
[254:56.03]Yeah, but this exact same thing happened in the beginning of the game with the fire.
[255:03.33]And then I ran away, and then I woke up from a car accident.
[255:06.46]Remember?
[255:06.80]Shouldn't have called that guy a dick.
[255:13.38]Everybody who is mean to anybody else at any point in this game gets killed by their monster double.
[255:19.38]But what's the whole car accident part?
[255:24.88]But what's with the whole burn the house down in the beginning part?
[255:36.55]Well, we, uh... Every single person in the game is dead now.
[255:40.97]Except, uh... Oh, John.
[255:43.05]I know John's dead.
[255:43.93]I have to do it.
[255:44.77]I have to.
[255:45.07]This is an Infinity War spoiler.
[255:46.57]If you haven't seen Infinity War, then fucking just mute your everything.
[255:51.43]This is like just Thanos at the end.
[256:01.89]I thought you'd be here.
[256:04.51]Leave me alone, will you?
[256:05.33]I've lost everything.
[256:08.43]You've lost everything?
[256:11.21]Are you kidding me?
[256:12.19]Who is this?
[256:13.05]Just get out of here.
[256:13.89]Go away!
[256:15.07]You should have stayed away.
[256:18.23]Big reveal?
[256:20.41]I'll never forget or forgive you for what you did.
[256:31.72]Is Andrew going to jail?
[256:33.30]That was, uh, Tanya's boyfriend?
[256:37.14]Why is he so much older and why am I so young?
[256:38.86]Um, was there a voice line there?
[256:42.26]He just mouthed the words.
[256:43.10]Yeah.
[256:44.32]You okay, buddy?
[256:44.80]You seem a little confused.
[257:04.31]Don't do it.
[257:06.01]Don't do it.
[257:13.28]You don't need to push his head down.
[257:14.42]He doesn't even have cuffs on.
[257:16.16]He can just get in.
[257:18.32]Wait, what?
[257:18.82]He just aged?
[257:20.26]He's not gonna do it.
[257:30.52]We're diverting all traffic through Little Hope.
[257:35.79]You're the driver.
[257:37.37]Why wouldn't that officer be like, um, what the fuck are you talking about?
[258:05.37]Yeah, I didn't see this part coming.
[258:07.99]Was it supposed to be like a split personality thing where he just like is all the characters?
[258:12.00]Can everyone just shut up?
[258:15.52]This isn't helping us find help or getting us out of here.
[258:22.74]Well, but this is accurate though because everybody died.
[258:24.78]So he was the only one left.
[258:26.08]So this is accurate.
[258:30.52]Hi there.
[258:32.00]How you doing?
[258:34.62]We like talked to him in the bar, but we were just... I did decline the drink, but what does that have to do with it?
[258:45.41]I...
[259:04.97]Weren't there specific times when we were in two different places?
[259:08.53]So how does that make any sense?
[259:21.24]Hey!
[259:22.30]Explosive bullet!
[259:23.50]You motherfucker, you!
[259:24.83]You take a goddamn shot at me?
[259:27.07]Quit hiding in there!
[259:28.35]Get away from here!
[259:30.11]So I just was like a delusional... I don't get it.
[259:32.34]What's with all the 1600 shit?
[259:33.22]Yeah.
[260:02.55]In a police response time.
[260:03.97]It took like 48 hours.
[260:12.61]Yeah, they're coming.
[260:15.11]They're coming.
[260:16.10]Didn't he say, didn't he, didn't that guy Vince say, they're coming to get you.
[260:19.74]They're coming.
[260:21.44]Who's coming?
[260:21.98]Why wouldn't you say... Like the night before.
[260:24.49]But if you knew that this person had, you know, problems, why would you do that?
[260:28.27]Why wouldn't you be like, hey, Andrew, like, come talk to me for a minute.
[260:31.71]They're coming to get you!
[260:35.91]I think that was the ending for you actually killed... I want to believe that there was an ending where everyone survives and it's fine, but I don't know.
[260:47.82]Or maybe it is.
[260:48.82]But maybe that's just one of the... Okay.
[260:50.72]What makes you happy, really.
[260:51.98]It's possible that's not what really happens.
[260:53.90]And you eventually found him.
[260:58.77]The bus driver.
[261:00.21]Maybe he can now put the past behind him.
[261:03.67]Never mind.
[261:04.15]He's telling us it was a real ending.
[261:11.47]Imagine if when we got a hint in the very beginning of the game, he went, It's the bus driver.
[261:15.79]It's you.
[261:23.39]Till we meet again.
[261:25.53]Maybe in the South Pacific.
[261:27.59]Or the Arabian desert.
[261:29.17]Dude, this is the next two.
[261:30.73]Or somewhere else.
[261:36.38]But we will meet again.
[261:40.02]At least one more time.
[261:42.26]At least one more time.
[261:43.44]Did you hear that?
[261:44.62]Yeah.
[261:45.54]What did we say at the beginning of the stream?
[261:47.90]What did we say?
[261:48.38]It's supposed to be eight of these.
[261:50.91]Yeah.
[261:53.44]He said, I'll see you at least one more time.
[261:58.52]He didn't say, I'll see you six more times.
[262:01.53]I think they've got at least guaranteed budget for one more.
[262:08.83]I'll see you again, guy, in October of 2021.
[262:11.11]For man of Medand.
[262:19.60]The Reeve Medan-a-ding.
[262:23.02]Man of Medan 3.
[262:25.08]Medan is back.
[262:27.90]Is this a copyright song or is this a game?
[262:36.49]Alright, here's the thing.
[262:40.51]They have a really cool idea here.
[262:42.59]Like, it really is.
[262:43.49]You can play a co-op kind of choices game with another person.
[262:46.87]It's like a horror game.
[262:47.61]That's cool.
[262:50.01]I kind of feel like they get so far into the weeds with how the story has to be this super twisty bullshit.
[262:56.91]Like, just make a horror, make it a horror game.
[263:00.12]Make it, like, scary and just horror movie.
[263:02.02]Why does it have to have this weird, going into the past and into the future and then there's a twist.
[263:06.74]There's another twist.
[263:07.99]Watch out, you're not you.
[263:09.13]You're this guy.
[263:09.83]You might not be me.
[263:12.58]I guess they don't want, uh, jackasses like us to guess the ending two and a half hours in, but it's, like, doesn't really matter that much if you do, as long as it's a nice story.
[263:22.27]Yeah, but that's what I mean.
[263:23.59]Wouldn't it be more fun if the actual story was about you get to choose kind of who lives and dies and not about, like, here's this convoluted, twisty story?
[263:33.78]Like, that itself is fun.
[263:35.20]Like, having, like, five to ten people that you get to decide when and maybe try to save them.
[263:39.40]Do they die?
[263:39.90]Do they not die?
[263:40.92]Is the monster there?
[263:43.60]I guess, are we led to believe?
[263:45.06]They explained away with the hand wave all the other characters in our timeline, but was there any closure for the old timeline, or was that also a delusion?
[263:58.01]I'm sorry, there's somebody just singing loudly over you.
[264:03.33]Yeah, it's in credits.
[264:07.41]We can't skip.
[264:08.59]Can I alt-tab?
[264:11.65]Oh, unless there's an after credits thing.
[264:13.35]There was an after credits in Man of Medan.
[264:15.69]Somebody said there is an ending where you... No.
[264:18.44]Well, I'm so glad we didn't get it.
[264:21.98]There was an after credits in Medan, I think.
[264:24.44]There is an ending where you do that.
[264:34.18]Can you imagine if that's how that ended?
[264:35.68]That would be so ridiculous.
[264:37.89]I would have to do it.
[264:40.03]was with the beginning scene which is really unlucky house fire where everybody died yeah I that's what but that's what I'm saying like what you you don't have to make this crazy multi-layered story horror movies are scary because there's a monster that kills people and it's like a popcorn movie I've got a skip button but I don't know if
[265:04.24]Like, we don't need layers on top of layers on top of layers of storytelling.
[265:07.13]Like, just this ten people, they all, like, have their own personalities, and you get to do something, go on an adventure, and be careful, some of them might fucking die, get the monster at the end.
[265:15.69]Well, the problem is, there's, like, too many characters that you kind of don't care when they die, because, like, let me just throw a character out there.
[265:22.48]Daniel.
[265:23.32]What was his personality?
[265:25.02]I don't know.
[265:25.48]It was just, I'm, I'm just a guy that stands around and reacts.
[265:31.48]Would you say he's a react something?
[265:35.92]Maybe.
[265:36.94]We don't say that on this channel anymore, though.
[265:43.51]His personality was Daniel.
[265:46.71]It wasn't just a monster.
[265:47.83]It was an allegory.
[265:49.43]Yeah, I know, but... I could do without... Okay, so how long is this?
[265:54.87]This is about, what, four and a half hours?
[265:56.87]There was absolutely, like, maybe an hour and 20 minutes of just kind of exposition.
[266:03.52]Where we could have been, like, running away from shit and, like, killing each other and stuff.
[266:09.48]It's kind of a damned if you do, damned if you don't, because the less talking there is, the more QTEs there are.
[266:14.65]That's true.
[266:18.83]Skip, Jerma is waiting.
[266:21.47]Oh, sorry, I thought I pressed it.
[266:23.29]I thought I had control for some reason.
[266:29.14]These are... sort of trailers.
[266:30.86]I hope we actually get to use guns in the next one.
[266:38.87]That would be fun.
[266:40.47]I fought that thing like three days ago.
[266:43.63]That's B-Bazuzu.
[266:45.09]Isn't it?
[267:02.15]I'm not even kidding, I actually did.
[267:04.07]I actually fought that thing, like, in VR.
[267:05.99]Like, four days ago.
[267:08.81]House of Ashes.
[267:11.09]It's actually Pazuzu.
[267:12.23]Huh.
[267:12.81]There you go.
[267:17.35]Achievement unlocked.
[267:18.23]Fate worse than death.
[267:20.23]You played the second Man of Medan game.
[267:26.54]Little Hope.
[267:30.38]Well...
[267:31.48]There was no after credits.
[267:32.52]It was just a trailer.
[267:33.72]What are the bonus features?
[267:41.33]Designing the demons.
[267:42.51]An interview with Will Poulter.
[267:44.99]The art book.
[267:48.87]Fuckface run.
[267:49.67]I mean, I feel like it's going to take a long time to do a fuckface run of this game.
[267:55.65]I feel like it's a lot of boring bits that we can't skip.
[268:00.75]Not if we don't read any of the lore.
[268:04.19]Remember because we walked forward last time?
[268:10.51]I'll do whatever.
[268:11.46]You want to just see what happens?
[268:12.72]It's up to you.
[268:14.74]We already did a fuckface run.
[268:16.22]That was the fuckface run.
[268:16.94]Yeah, but we didn't do a no talking run.
[268:20.22]Yeah.
[268:21.48]I feel like there's probably an hour worth of doing nothing before somebody dies.
[268:29.63]Because they really backloaded a lot of that content in the last hour or two.
[268:37.28]Let's try it.
[268:38.06]Let's try a do-nothing run.
[268:39.98]And just try to kill everybody as fast as possible.
[268:46.75]The real fuckface run is everyone alive run.
[268:51.71]Alright, let's just try it.
[268:53.35]Might as well.
[268:55.67]This is the bonus portion of the stream if you're going to leave.
[268:59.22]I mean, if it's really bad.
[269:01.38]Yeah, it might be.
[269:02.02]There's nothing wrong with just, like, stopping after.
[269:05.44]It's not like it has to be finished if it doesn't work out.
[269:11.99]Give me one sec.
[269:12.63]I do want to say one quick thing to my stream.
[269:15.17]I'll give you a second to talk to your stream, too.
[269:16.89]Alone.
[269:19.09]Alone.
[269:19.79]Mm-hmm.
[269:22.11]Alright, so if you're taking off, that was Man of Badan 2.
[269:26.64]Dark Anthology 2, whatever it is.
[269:28.76]Little Hope.
[269:31.68]Tomorrow is Halloween.
[269:33.17]Actually, 8, 9, 10.
[269:34.91]Actually, it is Halloween, I think, for a lot of you guys, if you're in EU.
[269:38.33]Tomorrow we're doing VR.
[269:40.65]So we're going to be playing exclusively scary VR games tomorrow for Halloween.
[269:48.30]For the remainder of tonight, we're just going to do this.
[269:50.56]We're just going to fuck around.
[269:51.60]And if this is just boring, then the stream just ends.
[269:58.32]So, if you're taking off, we'll see you tomorrow, maybe, for VR and Halloween.
[270:01.48]If I don't see you tomorrow, then happy Halloween.
[270:06.41]And pleasure.
[270:07.77]And here comes the bonus content.
[270:11.03]Rate the game.
[270:11.59]I don't know, like a... I don't think it's like a 4.
[270:23.73]uh it's it's definitely a at least it's at least a five it is it's not lower than a five it's just just not great let's get some input here hey what would you get do you think that ign gave a correct score with a five out of ten for this um or do you think this is more like a 5.8 or like a six I I'm gonna probably say like what was man of a dan
[270:52.86]I think, okay, easier question, which is better, this or Man of Medan?
[270:57.65]Man of Medan was probably better because it just, I feel like it was more fun to play Man of Medan.
[271:05.77]Yeah, I think moment to moment, I think Man of Medan somehow made even less sense than this, but...
[271:14.69]that let you, like, I don't know, you were on a boat, like, the yacht, then you go diving, then you, like, you weren't just on Fog Road for three quarters of the game.
[271:24.06]It was, like, different places.
[271:25.94]It was at that weird, like, mansion with the big dinner, the big dining room.
[271:29.20]Like, Rundown House number five is kind of too much.
[271:34.88]Yeah.
[271:37.74]And you don't do anything during the lore grab segments except...
[271:42.44]Like, occasionally talk to somebody as a spirit.
[271:46.08]Which, I guess, didn't exist.
[271:47.88]It's 5.7.
[271:48.42]5.7.
[271:50.30]I would say... I mean... I would say 5 out of 10.
[272:00.59]It's pretty fair.
[272:03.21]Yeah.
[272:04.45]5.7, I think.
[272:05.45]Man of a Dam was probably like a 6.5.
[272:06.45]I would say Man of a Dam was like a 6.8.
[272:08.47]Like a 7.
[272:10.84]man of medan had more like young people dialog but it was um just a little bit more variable yeah 5.7 for little hope 6.2 for man of medan final answer
[272:27.30]but it was it's still like it's fun to play anyway I guess it's like five it's not a five out of ten I regret buying it five out of ten it's like a five out of ten if I had to be like an objective game reviewer that's true alright you ready you ready to try just to do like a don't talk run yeah and just sit here and watch the movie I guess
[272:52.15]We can do scene selection.
[272:53.47]We can skip all the bullshit, I think.
[272:55.15]Should we just not skip the bullshit?
[272:56.31]Should we just do it from the beginning?
[272:57.23]What do you think?
[272:59.09]Um... You can start from, like, the house, right?
[273:05.15]Yeah.
[273:06.58]Diversion, family.
[273:07.40]It's just the bus crash in the very beginning, right?
[273:10.32]Yeah, I think this whole first three scenes here, the reunion, I think, is where we start from.
[273:18.64]Or darkest dreaming.
[273:22.48]Because this is all predetermined.
[273:29.16]Alright, we're going to skip to Reunion.
[273:34.23]Is that the house?
[273:35.51]No, that's like the bus crashed and now we're all standing here.
[273:39.51]Oh, yeah.
[273:41.13]Because all that is, I think, pre-recorded.
[273:44.32]I think what would have made my opinion better, if they didn't lean so hard into the twist...
[273:50.97]Like you were saying, like, the guy is crazy, and he just imagined all those people and shot at you.
[273:57.89]Like, why not hone in on the spiritual aspect instead of... I feel like that was the same thing in Man of a Dan.
[274:05.05]They're scared to tell, like, a supernatural horror story, and they want everything... It has to be based in reality.
[274:09.94]It has to be real.
[274:10.44]It has to have some kind of explanation.
[274:13.78]People are saying, use a controller for me to press no buttons.
[274:18.62]I don't think... Are you sure you want me to... What are you talking about?
[274:25.37]Alright, you ready?
[274:26.51]Here we go.
[274:28.03]It's time to do nothing.
[274:29.87]Because I liked the lore better up until the end.
[274:37.53]Because Man of Adan was like, they're breathing in the gas, and if you accidentally talk to your co-op partner once, you'll figure out the entire plot.
[274:46.50]Yeah.
[274:49.50]You do.
[274:50.54]All it takes is the other person you're playing with to go, hey, I just like attacked you.
[274:53.89]It's like, oh, that's the whole story ruined.
[274:57.05]Hey, Taylor, help me get Andrew up on his feet, will you?
[275:00.96]Wait, I don't remember anything.
[275:04.32]Who are you?
[275:05.31]Okay, so Andrew is talking to nobody, right?
[275:07.07]Okay.
[275:07.25]You're concussed.
[275:08.19]I'm John.
[275:08.69]You're a college professor.
[275:10.43]You were taking a bus on a field trip, but that didn't work out so well.
[275:13.47]I got a question.
[275:14.43]So why is he imagining these people?
[275:16.89]Is this his family?
[275:18.64]This is his family, right?
[275:19.78]Think of it as a character-building exercise.
[275:27.40]Come on.
[275:27.90]We can do it.
[275:28.80]What if we just don't?
[275:38.70]So, since you're, like, player one, I don't think my character's conversation is even happening.
[275:45.88]Oh, that's right.
[275:46.60]Like, I have a split... So this is his dad, but wouldn't he know, wouldn't he recognize them, like, as his dad and his, like, family and shit?
[275:50.28]Wouldn't he recognize them?
[276:08.96]why can't we stay here no we could be here all night our best move is to get to the others towards town see if we can find some help the bus driver might come back we should wait for him the driver's done what we should be doing gone into town for help this is just this person's just listening to music
[276:37.42]okay wait here all night then I'll go myself hey I've already missed my first qt yeah I missed two in a row professor right I got we got pushed into it anyways no matter can we stick together I don't want to wait on my own I guess he's right we should all stick together I got no signal either must be some kind of black spot or you didn't pay your last bill you get that during the crash well this is just the same as I I missed this one the first time I think
[277:06.65]It's just the same gameplay.
[277:08.75]Yeah, it is.
[277:12.19]Except with added silence.
[277:14.15]Yeah, it's the same thing except with no extra commentary.
[277:19.72]He thinks he's smarter than us, but book smart is no good out here.
[277:24.74]He's all up himself acting like the big man on campus.
[277:32.77]No choice run.
[277:35.82]That's from being the hanging marks, yeah.
[277:37.80]I mean, it all makes... Okay, when you get all the pieces put in front of you, it makes sense.
[277:46.91]But that doesn't mean it's any good.
[277:48.77]It's just kind of like, oh... It doesn't really make sense.
[277:52.49]It's kind of just like, he's crazy.
[277:55.65]Roll credits.
[277:57.17]Now what do we do?
[278:01.05]The whole bus crashing thing and then the little hope shit.
[278:05.77]It's almost like they wrote the story and then added this part.
[278:09.11]It's a guy with problems afterwards.
[278:11.73]So who's this?
[278:12.47]Is that the brother?
[278:24.12]uh Daniel you mean yeah is that the brother I saw a photo of Daniel from like 1917 or something like that I think this is uh like the navy or something ready I'll push hard from my side ready three two one push hold now good for a rusty chain not strong enough two one push
[278:52.96]Here, let me have a shot.
[278:55.07]John always steps in when no one else can do it.
[278:58.03]Three, two, one.
[279:06.17]What?
[279:11.99]That's how it's done.
[279:13.31]What?
[279:13.51]But it's just him trying to do it himself.
[279:17.76]Like, so is this, I assume all this is real, but it's just one person, right?
[279:22.66]Yeah, you'd have to do that by yourself.
[279:26.27]By the way, if you just open the door, why not just, what's the point of QT?
[279:31.45]Just open the door, just have them do like the one, two, three, break it.
[279:34.19]What's the point of having any of that happen?
[279:36.67]If it doesn't, it doesn't matter.
[279:37.63]You'll stay here with me, won't you?
[279:48.58]uh looks like he ain't so keen after all if you got something to say to me spit it out do we alright I just freaked out for a second I thought something wrong with the game but you do you're doing to do nothing right um okay let's everyone take a breath so he's a bus driver whatever you say well what did he crash into did he run over the girl
[280:16.33]Remember, it was like the girl.
[280:17.25]You saw the girl from his, because wasn't he in the house at the beginning?
[280:21.55]With the girl?
[280:22.29]The girl burns.
[280:22.75]So he has a memory of her?
[280:23.75]Yeah, the girl burns.
[280:25.35]Can we please just survive?
[280:26.43]He has a memory of her and inserts her back into the present?
[280:31.23]So Little Hope is a real town.
[280:33.31]It's not like Silent Hill.
[280:34.34]So why is walking, are we just walking in circles?
[280:37.84]Is he just walking in circles and this is just a normal town?
[280:41.48]Well, yeah, we're led to believe that nothing is real because he's imagining it.
[280:44.70]Based on the ending.
[280:45.38]Is it weird for me that that's like as just simple as being just like, oh, by the way, the whole thing was a dream.
[281:01.53]right like oh every the whole the whole game was a dream keep moving that's what that is still not sure heading into town it's kind of what man of a dan was too though I'm going to hang out by the bus while you all do whatever you have because we just inhaled gas and saw monsters none of it was real okay
[281:18.17]And then we got shot by the, uh, military?
[281:22.26]But here's the thing.
[281:22.80]This puts so many unnecessary expectations on the third game.
[281:26.70]Because now, guess what?
[281:28.22]You and I are gonna be like, Alright, what's the fucking weird, like, dream twist?
[281:32.26]Is that a real person?
[281:33.76]Rather than to be able to, like, enjoy the story or whatever it is.
[281:36.10]I think they're all real, but they're just, like... He's just talking to himself.
[281:42.68]They're just his people he met in his life.
[281:45.96]This is some very weird shit going on here.
[281:48.38]yeah first he loses his pride then he loses his way Andrew is the only person who's real but he's actually like 70 years old yeah it's not possible but it's for some parts it's always gonna be funny here but we've got better so he just he still thinks he's like a teenager watch out yeah around and tell me what's going on here he got like injured together this is getting ridiculous indulge me
[282:16.86]So he's not actually going anywhere.
[282:18.36]He's just, like, imagining them go somewhere.
[282:20.58]Because Andrew's not going.
[282:22.64]And then he walks around in a circle.
[282:23.68]And then he imagines them walking back.
[282:29.27]What?
[282:31.21]I walked away from you!
[282:33.71]We're trapped here!
[282:35.39]There's no way out!
[282:36.23]I don't understand!
[282:39.39]He's also imagining his brother and sister going out.
[282:41.85]Yeah.
[282:42.23]That's true.
[282:42.79]What the fuck?
[282:49.53]Okay, let's try something.
[282:51.57]We'll all go together.
[282:53.39]We came from that direction.
[282:54.69]We must be able to go back that way.
[282:57.77]I want everyone to stay real close.
[283:00.57]No stragglers.
[283:02.89]You want to put us on a kid's line?
[283:05.39]I do like the facial animation.
[283:08.07]It's like a well-made video game.
[283:10.75]You know what I mean?
[283:11.35]Like, the actual character talking...
[283:15.73]Facial animations.
[283:16.59]It doesn't look bad.
[283:17.36]Yeah, and I'll be honest.
[283:18.32]I know this is an unpopular opinion.
[283:19.76]I don't mind QTEs in these kind of games because they're supposed to be... It's supposed to be just like a shit show anyway.
[283:28.10]I admit that is a little odd.
[283:32.16]More than a little.
[283:33.44]I played Watch Dogs 3 yesterday.
[283:35.22]See?
[283:35.64]And this looks like a thousand times better on the same graphics card.
[283:39.05]We are trapped.
[283:40.33]We can't leave here.
[283:42.43]Okay.
[283:43.47]Calm down.
[283:44.31]Breathe.
[283:45.66]There's a rational explanation for what's happening.
[283:48.54]Maybe we all died in the crash.
[283:51.48]Yeah, nice theory, but I'm pretty sure we're all still alive and kicking.
[283:55.69]I think it looks alright.
[283:56.45]I think this looks good.
[283:57.21]You were schooling us on creative writing, not metaphysics.
[284:00.23]I know who I'd like to be kidding.
[284:01.29]It's Uncanny Valley, but it's still better than a lot of the other games I see.
[284:06.53]That is way out of line.
[284:09.10]I had no way of knowing that damn bus would crash.
[284:11.46]You can't put that on me.
[284:12.88]Are you for fucking real?
[284:14.76]Watch your tone, will you?
[284:16.62]I am doing my best to understand this, just like you and the rest of us.
[284:20.71]Yeah, that looks good.
[284:22.59]It's probably his head is hurting or something.
[284:28.31]I think the animation looks pretty good.
[284:29.72]Someone else thinks they can do a better job?
[284:32.76]Step right up!
[284:34.04]At least the facial animation.
[284:34.82]Maybe it isn't real.
[284:36.69]I don't feel like we rushed, but it was only- we only took like four hours.
[284:39.75]Yeah, there he goes, and then he's looking around.
[284:41.69]You gonna play the other six sequels they have planned in the future with the Taliks?
[284:45.44]Uh, yeah.
[284:45.62]I'll be 41.
[284:58.52]Now let's be logical.
[285:00.74]The fog is between us and the bus.
[285:02.78]I don't think that's realistically going to release.
[285:04.82]There's no fog between us and town, so let's head that way.
[285:09.16]I don't get how heading further away from the bus helps.
[285:13.37]There is nothing on the bus we can use to get help.
[285:17.93]In town, there will be people, a working phone, something.
[285:21.77]It pains me to admit, but he's right.
[285:23.49]There's nowhere else we can go except into that damn town.
[285:27.01]Sounds like a plan to me.
[285:29.43]Alright, so now somebody said this in chat.
[285:33.74]Andrew just doesn't do anything.
[285:35.98]He just kind of stands around and goes, yeah.
[285:40.77]I get it now.
[285:41.09]Oh, it's from like the 17 times I got smokered in the last Left 4 Dead game.
[285:53.07]They can't have the fog unless Andrew goes there.
[285:55.55]Oh, wait a minute.
[285:56.05]That's true.
[285:56.35]That's true, isn't it?
[285:57.31]So, okay.
[285:57.49]What's with the cat, though?
[285:58.11]There's a lot of, like, red herrings.
[285:59.23]And they specifically go out of their way to be like, do you think we're all dead?
[286:01.60]No, we're not, because we know these dumb players are going to say that.
[286:26.95]And we did.
[286:28.71]I'm not sure this is such a great idea.
[286:32.32]We should check it out.
[286:33.52]There could be a phone inside.
[286:36.64]I'll go in and take a look around.
[286:37.66]Go ahead.
[286:38.46]We'll be right behind you.
[286:43.26]And it's kind of funny that the, you know what?
[286:45.80]The whole Little Hope storyline, he just made up in his head.
[286:50.08]Well, yeah, because he's going, he's exploring Little Hope and making up the backstory as he reads the museum lore.
[287:01.32]That's like, that's ridiculous.
[287:03.68]That's another layer.
[287:04.40]So he's breaking into each of these Little Hope buildings, reading a blurb, and then he gets the lore grabbed and invents like a backstory for it.
[287:13.23]So he's just like creative writing inside of his own head.
[287:17.29]Relax.
[287:21.49]I said nothing about us.
[287:27.04]I'm not ready to go public about us yet.
[287:30.26]Okay, but he's not here.
[287:33.40]Why is this conversation happening on screen if he's not here?
[287:38.39]I need to know 100% I can rely on you.
[287:41.71]That you'll never let me down.
[287:44.00]So I'm in the Andrew group and you're in the actually not happening group.
[287:48.06]So he's simultaneously making up multiple conversations 50 to 100 feet away from each other?
[287:55.11]Someone in chat said that John is a creative writing professor.
[287:58.55]Laughing my ass off.
[288:00.19]Oh, that is true.
[288:07.52]But there are specific portions where Andrew is somewhere else, and there's two people walking around like a mile away.
[288:14.39]How is he making, how does he know what's going on over there?
[288:16.95]How is he making that up?
[288:21.03]So this dude is real and exists.
[288:22.93]This is Tanya's boyfriend.
[288:24.43]Oh, you know, dude, hold on, dude.
[288:25.72]Pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it.
[288:27.32]This is important.
[288:28.32]We need to put, we need to put like a thing on the screen that just says like, oh, hey, by the way, spoilers for the fucking whole game.
[288:34.28]We didn't, we're just talking about everything that happened.
[288:37.50]It's a bit late for that.
[288:40.76]Is it late for that?
[288:42.38]Pretty late.
[288:43.30]Hold on.
[288:43.66]Let me just do it.
[288:44.16]Because I feel like if it's like, oh, what's this?
[288:46.78]Somebody's streaming this game.
[288:47.66]Oh, they're right at the beginning of the game.
[288:48.82]Cool.
[288:49.36]That's the guy.
[288:50.56]He made it all up.
[288:53.74]I'm just going to put it on quick.
[289:05.07]There.
[289:09.23]Okay, let's go.
[289:15.12]Wait, what is this?
[289:17.32]How do I have four X files here?
[289:20.64]Alright.
[289:21.36]Three.
[289:22.00]You ready?
[289:22.68]There we go.
[289:28.67]Ready up.
[289:30.35]Did you just put fuckface run again?
[289:32.61]No, I said second playthrough.
[289:33.87]Spoiler talk.
[289:43.99]Oh my god, the title of my stream is that stupid little in-joke with like 10 people in pre-stream, whatever.
[289:48.97]I mean, let's be fair.
[290:03.79]The game did come out today.
[290:06.78]Alright, I'm good.
[290:13.05]Didn't it release, like, six hours ago?
[290:15.13]So, I mean, come on.
[290:16.21]If you planned on playing this, and you just open the stream, and the stream opens, you get your fucking Tostitos pizza roll ad, and then all of a sudden it's like, oh, Tostitos pizza rolls!
[290:25.54]Heat them up!
[290:26.90]He made the whole thing up in his head.
[290:28.40]Everyone's Andrew.
[290:29.06]He made everything up.
[290:30.04]Don't you think you'd be like, well, fucking great.
[290:31.58]Thanks.
[290:33.73]Save me 30 bucks.
[290:36.13]No, that's true.
[290:37.81]Alright, you ready?
[290:44.73]I can spend that 30 bucks on pizza rolls!
[290:46.81]How much is a bag of pizza rolls?
[290:52.36]10 bucks?
[290:53.04]8 bucks?
[290:55.10]Depends on the size of the bag.
[290:59.06]Hi there.
[291:00.46]How you doing?
[291:02.37]These developers' only cash flow is you and Etalyx.
[291:05.06]Excuse me.
[291:06.90]That's not even true.
[291:07.88]This is like a really, this is a popular franchise.
[291:10.86]People are buying this.
[291:12.08]Please.
[291:13.64]Come on.
[291:14.14]That's funny.
[291:15.66]What is?
[291:17.68]Okay.
[291:19.40]That guy could have just solved the whole game.
[291:22.08]He could have just elaborated.
[291:24.31]So thick it's stopping us from leaving.
[291:30.05]Yeah, yeah.
[291:30.65]I know that feeling.
[291:32.54]Like right now he's just kind of egging us on.
[291:34.38]Yeah, alright, hold on, but don't... Who's playing the darts?
[291:43.55]Oh, you're not listening to the- Oh, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, pause.
[291:47.93]What?
[291:48.57]We gotta start over.
[291:49.75]Why?
[291:49.93]Like, from this chapter.
[291:51.67]Because last time when we did Man of Medan, uh, if you're player one or player two, you get to see the other...
[291:57.39]You're just gonna literally see the whole shit you just saw for the entire game go the same, like, we flipped, remember?
[292:04.89]Oh, but... You can restart it from this same chapter, though.
[292:11.62]Okay, yeah, alright.
[292:13.08]So you have to, then you have to host the game.
[292:17.86]Oh, no, no, wait, is it like a Wiimote thing where at that menu we have to press... Alright, let's swap, let's go.
[292:25.93]Is it a Wiimote thing where whoever presses the button first gets first player?
[292:42.88]Don't play alone.
[292:46.22]So, do you have to invite me?
[292:47.44]Do we know that?
[292:48.10]Yeah.
[292:48.72]Okay.
[292:49.24]Yeah, just invite me.
[292:50.94]Ooh, invite.
[292:51.42]You are invited.
[292:52.32]I got an invite?
[292:55.74]Oh, cool.
[293:00.66]Okay, never mind.
[293:02.30]They made it worse.
[293:03.52]You actually... I can't.
[293:05.94]According to the devs, I have not ever played this game before.
[293:09.33]My options are news story or scene selection.
[293:12.55]Aww.
[293:14.35]Aww.
[293:14.47]Alright, well, it's okay.
[293:17.29]Let's see if we can Wiimote it.
[293:27.10]Okay, I'm gonna buy two.
[293:27.74]So, I guess, beware if you end up playing this game with a friend and then try and play it without them.
[293:33.87]Yeah, if you, for some reason, well, it is... Because I would have lost all progress.
[293:38.25]Like, if we were halfway through and we stopped and then never played it again for some reason.
[293:43.19]We are doing shared story, though.
[293:45.33]Maybe that's the reason why.
[293:46.79]Yeah, you're sharing it with me, but I also bought it.
[293:51.60]Yeah, couldn't one person buy this game and then, like, Steam...
[293:56.69]link to someone else?
[293:59.35]Yeah, you can.
[294:00.11]You can do remote play with this game.
[294:02.35]So why did we both buy it?
[294:03.23]Because it's better than dealing with, like, 500 millisecond lag, probably.
[294:14.85]Oh, you can't?
[294:15.31]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[294:16.97]Hold on.
[294:17.37]Maybe you can't.
[294:18.29]The thing pops up.
[294:20.17]Anytime you open the game, don't you get the thing where it says, remote play together?
[294:22.74]I get that in the corner.
[294:31.67]It's only for split screen.
[294:32.85]Oh.
[294:34.99]Why would it pop up when I open this game?
[294:37.19]That doesn't happen on every game I open.
[294:43.02]Oh, here we go.
[294:43.50]Alright, so if you hit click first.
[294:47.14]I don't think it matters, but I'll click because I'm just player two.
[294:51.08]Well.
[294:53.85]The game does have local co-op.
[294:55.09]Yeah, I think there's a... Yeah, there's a pass the controller.
[294:58.57]Yeah, so I guess you can do it that way.
[295:01.91]How did you pass the controller in Man of Medan?
[295:05.17]I'm not sure that pass the controller was in Man of Medan.
[295:07.15]I think it was just shared story or solo.
[295:09.93]Maybe it was.
[295:16.26]Next game?
[295:16.96]No, this is it.
[295:20.12]Sorry.
[295:25.96]My leg bumped RB.
[295:29.07]Hey, quit bumping.
[295:31.39]Uh-oh.
[295:33.09]Are we in hell?
[295:35.57]Is the game trying to tell us something?
[295:37.07]Is this where we pull the plug?
[295:40.25]This might be where we pull the plug.
[295:42.57]It may be.
[295:43.18]Can you do it?
[295:47.64]Awww, time to rip, pull the plug.
[295:49.96]It's probably better that way, because if we can't even swap, we're just gonna see 100% the same thing anyways, unless we started a new game.
[295:58.13]Yeah, it was fun, it was fun.
[295:59.63]Look, it's always enjoyable to play, like, a funny, crazy, scary game with a friend.
[296:04.31]It just is.
[296:04.67]Yeah, no, I mean, I enjoyed the experience, I just wish it was better.
[296:10.16]True.
[296:13.43]But, yeah.
[296:16.05]That's it.
[296:21.11]Thanks for playing, Dalek.
[296:22.24]It's always a pleasure.
[296:23.54]See you next year when we do the next one.
[296:27.70]Will there be a 2021?
[296:28.32]Is there a sequel?
[296:31.90]Yeah, that's going to come out.
[296:35.97]It's been like a year.
[296:38.33]It has to.
[296:40.42]That's Etalyx.
[296:42.40]Somebody, one of the mods, want to just spam his channel?
[296:46.81]Please.
[296:47.77]Don't.
[296:48.81]Spam it.
[296:49.37]And that was fun.
[296:52.45]Thank you, everyone, for watching this shit.
[296:58.81]I liked it, and I didn't like it at the same time.
[297:03.71]Yeah, it's kind of in a weird spot, but I still am glad I enjoyed the experience.
[297:11.49]I'm just frozen screen on the last cutscene still.
[297:14.43]We had fun for five hours.
[297:16.57]That's a five hour experience.
[297:22.06]The game was really four hours.
[297:23.72]We just kind of like... Why was it only four?
[297:26.60]Who else is playing this game that is taking six hours to beat?
[297:35.05]You must just be looking at every single piece of material.
[297:41.02]Alright, I gotta watch this quick video, and then I'm gonna end the stream.
[297:45.11]But, Etalyx, good night.
[297:47.81]Thanks for playing.
[297:48.67]See you again next time.
[297:51.05]Sorry, everyone, that you had to watch LoserPOV on Jerma's channel as he killed every single cat.
[297:57.84]I'm just kidding.
[297:58.42]It was fun.
[297:58.90]Alright, take it easy, man.
[298:00.92]Bye, everybody.
[298:03.50]Alright, this is a spoiler for one of the endings, but holy shit, you weren't kidding.
[298:09.25]This is actually an ending.
[298:12.25]I can't fucking believe it.
[298:17.02]Are you shitting me?
[298:18.16]Thank God this didn't happen.
[298:23.80]Let's watch it.
[298:25.08]By the way, me watching it does not mean...
[298:41.98]Okay.
[298:43.56]Why is this 12 minutes?
[298:44.48]I thought this was supposed to be the ending.
[298:58.50]Why am I getting so many... What was the Five Nights at Freddy's Among Us ad?
[299:02.16]That was just every meme in a banner.
[299:04.12]Okay.
[299:09.36]Let me quit out of this.
[299:17.10]Alright, let me get this bigger.
[299:19.30]So this is what could have happened.
[299:23.18]This is one of the endings, by the way.
[299:30.37]Okay, here we go.
[299:31.11]Let's watch it.
[299:33.43]Get it out of 144p.
[299:33.81]I will.
[299:33.99]Alright, let's see.
[299:53.51]Watching this does not mean I did it.
[299:55.69]It's just we're watching what could have happened.
[300:07.80]I can't fucking believe it.
[300:10.12]I can't believe it.
[300:13.64]No way.
[300:16.36]I really dodged a bullet here.
[300:17.66]No way.
[300:31.10]Holy shit.
[300:32.59]I can't believe I almost had to give a thousand subs.
[300:44.76]I can't fucking believe it.
[300:48.16]So what could have- what could have gone differently where that would have happened?
[301:00.19]If you didn't shoot the gun.
[301:02.15]Holy fucking shit.
[301:06.14]I almost didn't.
[301:07.50]I almost didn't fire the gun.
[301:08.72]If you don't shoot it, Vince, then there's no cops.
[301:18.83]Thank God I shot the gun.
[301:23.07]Here's the fucking best part about this.
[301:25.49]A bunch of you guys knew that was possible.
[301:28.51]And were absolutely trying to push me towards the decisions that made it possible.
[301:35.74]Is that why when that came up everyone was like, Don't shoot him!
[301:38.60]Don't shoot!
[301:39.14]Don't shoot!
[301:39.60]Don't shoot!
[301:47.09]And the trial makes a difference too.
[301:48.47]That's so ridiculous.
[301:55.81]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow for Halloween VR.
[301:59.49]We're gonna start with, uh, the Walking Dead game.
[302:02.61]Play that for a little while, and move on to... Oh, you know it!
[302:07.45]You know it's coming!
[302:09.51]Five Nights at Freddy's VR.
[302:11.89]Have to do it on, um... Have to do it on Halloween.
[302:19.64]And then maybe a couple other things too.
[302:21.58]It's Halloween in four minutes for, uh, yeah, Eastern Time, right?
[302:26.14]Happy Halloween.
[302:27.96]We see you tomorrow.
[302:28.52]We see you tomorrow.
[302:29.58]If we don't, have a good Halloween.
[302:32.29]Take care of yourself.
[302:40.79]Did you buy Saints and Sinners?
[302:42.83]Uh, I can tell you right now exactly what I bought.
[302:46.83]I have...
[302:52.76]Uh, let's see.
[302:55.56]It's whatever the... I think I just bought the VR one.
[302:58.17]Is there more than one version?
[302:59.63]Uh, it says Saints and Sinners.
[303:07.03]Walking Dead Saints and Sinners.
[303:09.73]That's the right one, right?
[303:16.14]Cool.
[303:20.70]Uh, raid Vinny?
[303:21.58]Yeah, okay, let's raid Vinny.
[303:22.94]Sure.
[303:23.12]Sure, sure, sure.
[303:26.55]Let's go.
[303:28.73]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[303:33.09]Good night.
[303:33.49]Thanks for watching.
[303:34.67]It's always fun to play with Etalyx.
[303:35.97]We're probably gonna play some more stuff, too.
[303:38.16]We've talked about, um, playing one of the Splinter Cells together.
[303:41.66]If we can get it to run.
[303:44.12]So, it's a pleasure to have Etalyx around.
[303:50.67]Annoying.
[303:52.09]I think I laughed way too hard.
[303:54.75]So, it's just like... I'll see you guys later.
[304:02.44]Go say hello to Vinny.
[304:03.70]Good night.
[304:04.04]Goodbye.
[304:05.02]Take care.
[304:07.72]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[304:08.76]Oh, shit.
[304:09.34]The credits.
[304:10.48]I forgot about the credits.
[304:12.30]It's going to raid.
[304:13.14]It's going to raid in 10 seconds.
[304:16.80]Oh, shit.
[304:17.72]Okay.
[304:18.42]Uh, thanks.
[304:19.02]No, seriously, thanks everybody for the sub.
[304:20.22]What about the money?
[304:21.36]Somebody gave money.
[304:22.78]Hold on.
[304:24.81]Let me do this quick.
[304:30.13]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[304:31.77]Come on.
[304:32.99]I have like 30 seconds to do this.
[304:43.01]Hurry.
[304:43.27]Okay, here it comes.
[304:48.48]Thank you, everybody, for supporting the stream.
[304:49.84]All the subs, all the gifted subs, all the resubs, you guys.
[304:51.96]Thank you, seriously.
[304:52.72]It's going to miss out.
[304:59.79]We're going to miss everybody past G. Read the missed bits.
[305:08.69]I'm logging in right now.
[305:09.81]I don't know why I was logged out.
[305:11.37]Alright, here we go.
[305:17.42]We had...
[305:19.37]Retrospecter gave a shitload of subs.
[305:21.87]Chef's Corner gave a shitload of subs.
[305:25.15]Look at me.
[305:25.73]Wait, this is from two months ago.
[305:28.31]Why is this happening?
[305:29.43]This is not recent.
[305:30.29]This is from two months ago.
[305:31.98]Thank you for the money.
[305:32.76]Thanks for the money.
