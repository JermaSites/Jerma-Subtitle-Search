[00:07.82]Wow.
[00:08.70]That's somebody already.
[00:11.12]How close were they?
[00:12.26]Would you say?
[00:12.84]Like on a scale of one to close?
[00:14.84]You're creeping through the bushes, whoever you are.
[00:17.24]There's a lot of action going on over here.
[00:26.10]Man, I'm in a bad spot.
[00:29.73]I hate going indoors.
[00:31.47]I really do.
[00:31.93]I always feel like someone's just going to be right next to me.
[00:37.02]I'm going to open a door and someone's going to be just in the bathroom.
[00:39.65]Who is really charging me right now?
[00:41.51]Actually, this is a pretty good spot.
[00:49.63]I couldn't see through the bushes.
[00:53.95]I could see you.
[00:54.63]I was like with the... You should have retreated.
[00:59.55]Can I get in the shower and just hide?
[01:05.04]Oh, what game are they playing?
[01:06.34]Oh, they're on Steam.
[01:08.16]What game is it?
[01:10.60]Oh, I can't tell.
[01:12.10]I can't see what game it is.
[01:13.12]What are you talking about?
[01:14.36]What are you talking about?
[01:16.91]I want to see what game they're playing on their PC.
[01:21.47]What?
[01:23.73]Just trust me on this.
[01:26.93]Trust me.
[01:27.43]Who's that?
[01:30.03]There's a computer sitting on this desk in this house.
[01:33.55]Get me out of this house.
[01:34.55]I'm out.
[01:34.81]I'm out.
[01:35.17]Get me out of the house.
[01:36.79]I don't care.
[01:37.25]Get me out.
[01:37.99]I don't want to play anymore.
[01:38.87]I don't want to play this game anymore.
[01:40.37]I don't care.
[01:40.77]I don't know if you're in there or not, but you might be.
[01:42.15]You probably are.
[01:42.59]Yes, you are.
[01:43.96]I might have got you.
[01:45.96]We aren't playing that game.
[01:46.68]I don't know what you're talking about, Gemma.
[01:51.08]I haven't seen anybody for like five minutes.
[01:53.76]Yeah, right.
[01:56.34]Oh, shit in my pants!
[01:58.12]Shit in my pants!
[01:59.16]Crossbow!
[02:01.14]Get crossbowed!
[02:03.46]God, show yourself again!
[02:05.33]I dare ya!
[02:07.65]Come on!
[02:09.31]God, show yourself again!
[02:12.69]Don't act like you're not gonna get... Wait a minute, where... I think I just saw movement.
[02:18.74]I may or may not have seen movement.
[02:24.12]Oh god.
[02:25.00]Oh god.
[02:25.88]Oh god.
[02:26.10]Oh god.
[02:26.76]Stealth?
[02:27.56]Hello.
[02:28.36]Hiding in the dark, I see.
[02:29.74]I didn't even see you until you shot at me.
[02:34.77]I was waiting there in the attic.
[02:36.23]I saw Jerma's panic attack underneath me when he was shooting zombies.
[02:39.49]And I was just going to wait for him to come up in the attic.
[02:41.23]But he never... He ran out of the house.
[02:43.03]Yeah, he did run out of the house.
[02:44.09]Dude, I just... That was terrifying.
[02:46.35]I just see the guy like in the window firing at me.
[02:49.35]Speaking of guys...
[02:52.26]Like, busy telling a story.
[02:55.66]I hear that.
[02:56.16]Jeez, did I shoot you one time?
[03:01.92]I am almost dead.
[03:03.14]I shot you a bunch of times.
[03:05.12]Why are zombies coming towards me?
[03:07.66]That happens a lot, I think.
[03:09.28]They don't go towards gunshots, they just go towards the first thing they see once gunshots happen.
[03:13.44]It's unfortunate, because a couple times I've been just... tactically positioned.
[03:21.58]Either that or Boo knows where I am.
[03:23.10]I'm not sure which.
[03:26.31]So, Jim, are you and I the zombies?
[03:28.47]I am a zombie right now, yes.
[03:30.31]Is it just me versus Boo?
[03:32.67]There are legit a hundred zombies on this street.
[03:40.11]Too many zombies on the street.
[03:42.44]Too many zombies on the street.
[03:44.26]Do you happen to have a crossbow, Boo?
[03:45.58]No.
[03:46.18]Oh, I was going to challenge you to a crossbow duel.
[03:50.39]I had one earlier, but I didn't get to shoot it before I died because you snapped me.
[03:55.62]You sniped me.
[03:58.13]Oh, I see ya.
[03:59.05]Oh, I see ya.
[04:01.07]I know.
[04:06.19]Did you see me?
[04:07.43]Not you.
[04:08.59]No!
[04:10.34]Get him!
[04:12.86]You ran!
[04:13.80]Okay, that was absolutely stealth, by the way.
[04:17.04]He turned around and ran the other way.
[04:19.30]I blended in and you still shot me instead.
[04:21.88]You didn't go after him.
[04:22.60]Why didn't you go after him?
[04:23.46]That's absolutely like a zombie.
[04:26.46]You want to play the part?
[04:27.56]I was playing the part.
[04:29.02]I was walking in a straight line.
[04:31.10]Even he shot me once or twice and I still played the part.
[04:34.82]You did like a person to pretend to be a zombie.
[04:37.60]Yeah, that was like a person's reaction to having a gun pointing at them.
[04:43.20]Like, no, shit, don't shoot me.
[04:44.48]What's going on?
[04:53.17]I can't handle this game.
[04:54.31]Is it too much for you?
[05:00.89]If there was someone legit in this house, I don't think we'd ever find each other.
[05:05.96]Got a feeling.
[05:06.68]I know for a fact.
[05:07.64]I know for a fact.
[05:12.10]That one of these rooms is occupied.
[05:19.54]Boo, did I hit you with any of those shots?
[05:26.19]Holy crap.
[05:29.71]Boo's focus.
[05:42.84]Where are you?
[05:50.76]Oh!
[05:51.08]God!
[05:59.17]Why were you running away?
[06:01.29]Where'd you think you were going?
[06:03.43]Gotcha, Boo!
[06:04.75]I gotcha!
[06:07.96]I saw you, and you were like, did I hit you with any of those?
[06:10.48]And I saw you through the glass door on the bottom floor.
[06:20.57]Snipe in the head!
[06:41.09]Bye.
