[00:10.94]Hey, what's up, everybody?
[00:13.14]Hey, what's up, everybody?
[00:17.92]What's up, guys?
[00:18.56]No.
[00:18.70]What is it?
[00:31.49]Hey, what's up, everybody?
[00:33.27]No, I can do better.
[00:35.71]One minute late?
[00:36.27]Yeah, fuck him.
[00:38.09]What is it?
[00:40.91]Fuck him, I don't even care.
[00:43.25]Hey, what's going on guys?
[00:44.21]It's Jerm here with the stream.
[00:49.73]Oh, oh my god.
[00:51.05]Oh my, oh my god.
[00:52.63]Hi guys, how you doing?
[01:00.68]I'm not late, I'm here, I'm fine.
[01:05.16]He's practicing, yeah, he's practicing.
[01:08.03]I had to get the intro right.
[01:09.01]I had to get it right.
[01:09.63]But the mic was hot.
[01:19.64]Anyways, hello.
[01:20.22]How you doing?
[01:23.74]He lied about Megamind.
[01:25.78]No, I did not lie about Megamind.
[01:27.49]It was a great movie.
[01:31.23]Okay.
[01:32.27]Yeah, I'm going to give you a synopsis.
[01:33.61]Fine.
[01:36.43]It's a blue evil guy who's an orphan sent to Earth.
[01:44.01]This other guy, Metro Man.
[01:45.27]What do you mean?
[01:46.97]What do you mean, tell us?
[01:47.86]Tell us.
[01:48.12]That's what I'm telling you.
[01:49.36]It makes hell.
[01:56.32]Space Dad, isn't it?
[01:58.12]It was okay.
[02:01.33]I like the big ending parade that they did.
[02:06.82]Dude, there's spoilers.
[02:11.65]What I did like the most about the movie was when he turned himself into the police.
[02:16.51]He turned himself in and imprisoned himself.
[02:19.29]Just like Rick from Rick and Morty did in that episode in season two.
[02:25.39]They put on a nice disguise.
[02:27.11]That's a holographic disguise.
[02:30.96]And then Hal actually at the end, you know, the fucking evil computer...
[02:37.75]It was a fine movie.
[02:38.77]I'd give it like a B+.
[02:40.29]Okay?
[02:51.51]There's no evil computer.
[02:52.71]What are you talking about?
[02:54.77]How from... It's an evil computer.
[02:59.42]He lied.
[02:59.88]There is no evil computer.
[03:01.32]What?
[03:01.80]Yes, there is.
[03:09.42]That's Space Odyssey.
[03:13.34]It was a fun movie!
[03:14.60]It was a fun movie!
[03:15.70]I liked the- at the end when everybody's dancing and the guy's in there and he's got like the orange suit on and he's dancing.
[03:24.05]Look, it doesn't matter if you think I watched it or not, I've seen it.
[03:37.65]I did see it!
[03:39.84]Anyways, it doesn't matter.
[03:40.62]Hey, welcome.
[03:41.22]We're going to play Fable 2 again.
[03:42.48]Hope everyone's having a good day.
[03:45.82]I'm ready to play.
[03:46.48]I'm ready to go.
[03:47.32]I have to tweet this, though.
[03:48.90]I'll be right back.
[04:41.71]To the guy that said I have really boring tweets, you're really not going to like this one.
[04:47.11]It's so boring.
[04:50.37]That was really boring.
[04:53.14]It just said more Fable 2 and that's it.
[04:55.50]I didn't say anything else.
[04:58.02]Use the gif?
[04:58.62]I don't even have the gif on my computer or my phone or anything.
[05:05.27]Why are you giving 50 community subs?
[05:06.55]You don't even know if the stream is going to be any good or not.
[05:11.47]That's so much money to give.
[05:13.25]That's too much money to give.
[05:14.69]What if the stream sucks?
[05:19.39]That's so much money.
[05:20.39]Thank you.
[05:21.03]ZappX, thanks for 50 community subs.
[05:30.07]Nah, thanks though.
[05:30.79]I appreciate that.
[05:31.43]That's too much money.
[05:33.59]Way too much money to give one single human.
[05:38.47]Remember, you act humble so you can get more money.
[05:40.23]It's a conspiracy.
[05:51.47]It's all just an act.
[05:54.97]You know what's, like, really, alright, let's real, I'm gonna do a real talk with you guys here.
[06:00.92]Yeah, like, it doesn't matter how much, like, somebody says, like, oh, you know, like, thanks, I don't, like, don't need it, don't want it, though, like, like, you never know who's just fucking with you, you know what I mean?
[06:10.48]You just never know who's, like, just lying to you.
[06:14.03]I get it.
[06:14.57]I get it.
[06:14.89]I could sit here and be like, oh, man, don't.
[06:16.57]No, don't do that.
[06:17.19]Don't do that, man.
[06:18.12]But, like, oh, thank you.
[06:18.84]Give me more.
[06:20.00]Like, there are people that are like that.
[06:21.24]It's like, how could you ever trust anybody?
[06:24.12]I get it.
[06:24.84]No, I completely get you.
[06:25.76]Don't worry.
[06:29.02]Well, thanks, though.
[06:29.68]Appreciate it.
[06:30.18]Thank you.
[06:33.98]Oh, so true.
[06:34.84]Oh, so true.
[06:36.12]He's farming like the so trues now.
[06:38.08]That's the next conspiracy.
[06:43.34]Be honest for this.
[06:44.48]Even if I am honest, it doesn't matter.
[06:45.80]Okay.
[06:48.85]Let's go play Fable 2.
[06:49.69]This is fun.
[06:52.35]I have a confession to give you guys, though.
[06:56.63]I may... I may have blacksmithed like 20 minutes before the stream started.
[07:04.02]I wanted to get it out of the way because I didn't want to just blacksmith for like the first 20 minutes of the stream.
[07:08.62]I just sat there in silence getting like an extra 10 grand.
[07:12.41]Okay?
[07:16.13]We're of course going to do that again, but I at least removed one 20 minute portion of the stream where it was going to be blacksmithing.
[07:24.44]And I also noticed that the weapons dealer here, the blacksmith here, has a 50% off sale right now.
[07:31.58]It's a bargain at that price.
[07:33.64]So I don't know why I just thought he was going to say, it's a me, Mario.
[07:36.88]I don't know why.
[07:37.52]Every time, it's a me.
[07:41.19]I don't know why that's what I thought he was going to say.
[07:43.69]That item's on sale.
[07:45.90]Okay, so everything's 50% off, so I'm going to buy everything.
[07:52.12]Look at this.
[07:52.98]This is a $4,000 sword.
[07:54.74]I'm going to get it for half off.
[08:00.04]Look at it.
[08:00.36]Steel flintlock rifle.
[08:02.08]$2,400.
[08:02.88]I'll take it.
[08:03.59]What are you going to do with the sword?
[08:04.91]With half a sword?
[08:05.37]What are you talking about?
[08:15.96]Oh, I get it.
[08:16.48]That's funny.
[08:18.76]Okay, and then... What else do I need?
[08:20.85]Yeah, I got a gun.
[08:24.05]Okay.
[08:24.51]Now, what about who... Anybody... You sell clothes here?
[08:29.57]Iron axe is best.
[08:31.53]What do you mean best?
[08:35.27]37 iron... Oh, yeah.
[08:36.67]Sell this.
[08:38.33]Always happy to buy your unwanted items.
[08:41.60]Wait, wait, he's 50% off!
[08:43.06]It's- I'm selling- Why am I selling this for 50% off?
[08:48.36]That's not how this- I don't come to this guy and say, oh, by the way, I see the sign.
[08:51.86]You have a 50% off sale.
[08:53.34]Me too.
[08:55.48]What?
[08:57.80]That's not how that works?
[09:00.78]God damn it.
[09:01.26]Whatever.
[09:01.62]I'll just go sell it next door to, like, the other guy.
[09:03.44]Yes.
[09:13.32]Ask questions about my daughter, please.
[09:18.04]What?
[09:18.20]Who's this guy?
[09:19.80]Kiernan the Traveler?
[09:21.00]Wait, is this my son?
[09:22.36]Kiernan the Time Traveler?
[09:27.45]Oh, shit.
[09:32.01]Alright, now I demand it.
[09:32.99]Alright, fine.
[09:34.13]I'll start.
[09:34.59]See?
[09:34.75]There we go.
[09:40.40]Alright, so now I've got... I want to go to... I want to get some new clothes.
[09:46.09]Albert, that's my dog.
[09:47.15]Okay, I want to go... I want to get some new clothes.
[09:52.75]Where's the tailor?
[09:55.35]Who sells clothes here?
[09:57.83]Do more blacksmithing.
[09:58.89]No, I'm not going to do more blacksmithing.
[10:04.39]Oh my god, what is going on here?
[10:09.81]50 more community subs.
[10:11.31]What are you guys doing?
[10:12.81]From Video Vivi.
[10:18.04]Thanks for the 50 community subs.
[10:20.30]Again, another person.
[10:21.42]Thank you a lot.
[10:23.84]Thank you a lot.
[10:35.87]Alright, I got a bunch of pies.
[10:36.73]I have to stay fat.
[10:38.57]It's important.
[10:41.29]I know for a fact that there's a demon door in this game somewhere, then we have to find it.
[10:44.29]Okay.
[10:46.68]Alright, here we go.
[10:52.28]Let's go do... I want the tailor.
[10:54.18]There's like a potion person.
[11:00.01]Why does he not say community subs anymore?
[11:02.53]I got tired.
[11:03.87]That got tired.
[11:04.59]What does that mean?
[11:10.55]I heard there's a sale, but there's not a real bargain or anything.
[11:13.55]What do you mean there's no bargain?
[11:16.40]I'm just going to buy all these cheat codes.
[11:22.90]Alvarine strength potion.
[11:24.16]Oh, shit.
[11:25.92]These are expensive, but I want them.
[11:27.96]Look at this.
[11:30.17]I'm going to get a healing potion, too.
[11:37.13]Java potion?
[11:38.09]Healing points, yep.
[11:40.61]It's no longer a community anymore.
[11:42.83]Alright, here we go.
[11:48.55]Facecam, pretty please.
[11:52.29]Nope.
[11:52.83]No facecam.
[11:53.43]I don't do facecam.
[11:54.43]I'm a non-facecam streamer.
[12:00.66]Alright, I'm gonna do a bunch of this.
[12:01.76]I wish there was a quick menu.
[12:06.22]Like, I remember the reviews of this game all saying that going like seven sub-menus in, or like three sub-menus in to click on an item was horrible.
[12:16.92]There's a riot.
[12:24.67]Why are you rioting?
[12:26.19]I'm not gonna try- I'm not gonna- I don't want face cam on!
[12:27.99]No, you're not getting it.
[12:29.45]No face cam.
[12:42.15]Because you're naked.
[12:44.71]How I am clothed in the comfortable privacy of my own house is how I'm going to be.
[12:50.52]And that's final.
[13:01.10]I can be as nude or non-nude in my home as I want to be.
[13:07.56]It really is naked.
[13:15.54]I'm not naked, but that doesn't mean that I could be.
[13:17.64]I couldn't be.
[13:25.83]Whatever.
[13:26.29]The right way to say that.
[13:26.93]Alright, concentrated XP.
[13:31.15]Now let's make some moves here.
[13:32.51]Okay, I got a lot of skills.
[13:35.88]Hello!
[13:37.30]Oh, that's my wife.
[13:38.06]Shit, um... Oh man, she's not happy at all.
[13:41.12]Don't worry, I'll just do a bunch of emotes.
[14:02.28]Oh, I can't game it?
[14:13.17]Come on.
[14:14.89]Do it!
[14:20.16]Am I naked?
[14:23.28]I'm not naked!
[14:24.06]But I could choose to be if I choose so!
[14:28.14]Right now, I could!
[14:29.78]You understand?
[14:30.38]Alright, we're good.
[14:53.15]Fecal funny.
[14:54.23]Stop saying that.
[14:55.13]It's an incredibly important emote in the game.
[14:57.49]Don't you get it?
[14:57.95]Okay, I'm leaving.
[14:58.75]Now let me level up.
[15:14.55]Just be happy that I actually off-streamed at all this bullshit.
[15:18.50]Okay, so I can do... I have about... Like, 9, 10,000?
[15:25.80]Blades 3 is 16,000.
[15:28.30]I think I'm gonna wait for Blades 3.
[15:32.43]But... I could probably do health, right?
[15:37.07]What the fuck?
[15:38.37]Level... Level 5 shock everything else level 1.
[15:43.62]Hmm.
[15:44.80]What about skill?
[15:45.44]Okay, I could do speed.
[15:49.01]Or accuracy.
[15:52.49]Yeah, I want accuracy.
[15:54.07]I have a cool gun.
[15:54.75]What about dexterous styles?
[16:02.11]Aimed ranged attack.
[16:03.83]Oh, shit.
[16:04.43]I want to do that.
[16:04.93]I definitely want to do that.
[16:15.08]Brutal Styles.
[16:15.76]Yeah, we'll get this.
[16:16.76]Flourishes.
[16:17.86]You've learned the Brutal Style Flourish.
[16:19.08]While holding X, move your L toward an enemy to build up an unblockable Flourish and then release X to unleash the Flourish.
[16:26.35]Yeah, cool.
[16:26.95]Alright, let's go.
[16:28.55]I got what I wanted.
[16:35.56]Did you watch Megamind?
[16:36.84]Yes, and I agree with fucking... What are the...
[16:46.78]Ropert and Ebert.
[16:47.76]Okay, I agree with Ebert and Ropert who said that it was two thumbs way up.
[16:55.88]Who were the people that reviewed the movies?
[17:08.56]Siskel and Ebert.
[17:10.66]No, but it was Siskel and Ebert, then it was Ebert and Ropert.
[17:18.65]Yeah, it was.
[17:19.49]Even Robert.
[17:24.62]I didn't make somebody up.
[17:25.78]What are you talking about?
[17:34.62]What are you talking about?
[17:35.88]Alright, let's go.
[17:36.46]I'm ready to go.
[17:37.84]Quest.
[17:39.65]What should I do?
[17:49.52]Knothall's Island, Big Freeze.
[17:52.66]Donkey Kong Country level.
[17:54.90]The Temple of Shadow.
[17:56.04]Gain entry to the Temple of Shadow.
[17:57.66]That sounds evil.
[17:59.04]The Summoners.
[17:59.80]Two idiots have read from the Necronomicon.
[18:02.24]The Book of the Extremely Dead.
[18:03.48]The gates of the Netherworld have opened.
[18:05.70]The Archaeologist.
[18:07.18]Make donations at the Temple of Light.
[18:09.20]Or go to the Sculptor.
[18:10.16]Let me go to the Sculptor.
[18:11.68]Drunk, we've got it.
[18:33.71]Prove you aren't high and naked.
[18:35.67]When could I ever prove that I'm not high and naked?
[18:38.13]What are you talking about?
[18:38.94]You want me to have like a face cam on my body and have like a drug test in the same room?
[18:44.72]What are you talking about?
[18:45.62]Why do I hear the... Is somebody after me?
[18:50.18]Why is this person after me?
[18:51.14]What's going on?
[18:52.38]Hey!
[18:55.00]No, no, not in front of the shit statue.
[18:57.14]Come on, this is humiliating.
[18:58.37]1600 gold, what?
[19:05.27]You have been charged with murder times three.
[19:08.13]It's just, okay, imagine getting, like, a ticket.
[19:11.51]And they write murder x3 on it.
[19:13.57]Uh.
[19:15.69]And, um, community service or resi- Alright, I'll pay it.
[19:20.79]Here, take the money and leave me alone.

[19:22.59]Ha ha ha.
[19:34.93]Can you imagine going to Walt Disney World and the sculpture of Disney in front of the garden is him holding his butt screaming while he's shitting his pants?
[19:49.32]Oh, like the magic of Walt Disney World.
[19:52.88]He's screaming while he's shitting into his hands.
[19:55.70]Okay, well, there it is.

[22:22.13]Like, in 500 years.
[22:24.05]I don't want... By the way, I don't want any recorded history.
[22:28.15]The only thing I want is I want, like, 15 statues of me holding my ass screaming.
[22:34.37]That's the only thing that I want, like, 100 generations in front of us to look back and be like, what was this for?
[22:45.46]Change pants?
[22:46.44]No.
[22:46.62]Alright, so that was easy.

[23:23.93]What?
[23:24.17]Ooh, the mage.
[23:48.07]Do you remember that name?
[23:49.57]He was there the night Lucian killed Rose.
[23:52.99]You didn't tell me that.
[23:54.79]How are we supposed to trust him?
[23:57.69]Hmm.
[23:59.39]Garth.
[23:59.77]Garth believed Lucian's interest in the Old Kingdom was purely academic, like his own.
[24:05.06]And Lucian- Party on, Garth.
[24:06.58]thought Garth was merely a brilliant scholar.
[24:09.76]When each learned the truth about the other, their partnership ended.
[24:14.26]Violently.
[24:18.43]Alright, let's go.
[24:19.15]You can do a Necronomicon scream.
[24:20.79]No, that's terrifying.
[24:21.39]Guys, I already have enough, like, problems.
[24:22.75]Opening and reading from the Necronomicon is like, well, um...
[24:48.10]Now I'm going to haunt your fucking house.
[24:49.40]Okay.
[24:57.79]The Hero of Will.
[24:59.01]Go to Brightwood.
[25:03.95]Oh, I haven't found this location yet.
[25:05.33]Okay, well, let's go.
[25:06.11]I won't make the same mistake.
[25:17.69]Let's go.
[25:18.17]This fable2.com bullshit.
[25:25.96]Websites didn't even exist back then.
[25:27.36]Are we having fun, Jeremy Deere?
[25:33.13]Yes.
[25:38.52]This was 2008?
[25:40.22]2009?
[25:41.56]Websites didn't even exist.
[25:44.04]Websites were created in like 2013 or something.
[25:47.76]Your YouTube channel was in 2011.
[26:01.45]I thought I was ahead of the curve.
[26:03.99]You know how NASA had the internet before everyone else did?
[26:05.79]It was me.
[26:11.58]Ooh, I like that.
[26:17.59]Ooh, I like this gun.
[26:19.53]What was the first website?
[26:27.33]It was www.hamsterdance.com.
[26:32.53]Don't... Oh, they're just shooting at each other.
[26:43.80]Are these guys bad?
[26:44.60]Are these bad guys?
[26:47.96]Do I help?
[26:51.14]I'm helping.
[26:52.90]I don't accidentally... Why is the guard mad at me for this?
[27:04.13]Oh, that was cool.
[27:09.30]Why are they mad about this?
[27:11.14]This is pissing them off.
[27:13.56]I'm helping you guys.
[27:14.58]I don't understand.
[27:20.59]Stop right there!
[27:21.33]They don't like magic.
[27:27.61]What did you find?
[27:28.01]Did you find something?
[27:36.27]100 million off the dead if you sing hamster dance.
[27:39.54]I don't remember what it was.
[27:41.52]It's... Oh, yeah, I do.
[27:43.78]It's like... What is that?
[27:51.26]Something like that, right?
[27:53.88]And then it goes, here we go.
[27:54.96]Oh, that's the remix, but you know.
[28:10.70]Where's the dig spot?
[28:16.20]Oh, clothing trader.
[28:23.12]Perfect.
[28:24.50]What do you got?
[28:26.96]Flogs.
[28:27.58]I kind of want it.
[28:28.14]Did I ever get a sun vest?
[28:38.39]Shirt.
[28:38.67]Striped bandana.
[28:40.85]No.
[28:45.91]Play the song.
[28:46.78]No.
[28:49.64]Okay, there it is.
[28:50.22]Alright, come on.
[28:50.68]Let's go.
[28:51.64]Where is it?
[28:51.98]There you go.
[28:55.48]Good boy.
[28:56.02]Good boy.
[28:56.56]Good boy.
[29:06.76]Oh!
[29:07.44]The secret castle of Faerva.
[29:09.14]That's disgusting.
[29:12.68]Buried condoms?
[29:17.82]Why wouldn't I... I would... Who would pick a condom up off the ground?
[29:24.19]That is the most universal, wretched thing that anyone could see on the ground.
[29:38.11]I mean, absolutely wretched universal.
[29:41.37]If you see that, it's like, I want to leave this whole area.
[29:45.59]I don't want to be where I am right now.
[29:50.47]Just dump, like, dump fucking alcohol all over where this is.
[29:53.47]I don't want to even be near here.
[30:00.28]Your dog is now a two-star treasure hunter.
[30:02.12]Oh, nice.
[30:06.86]Oops, sorry I dropped that.
[30:08.32]That was only 150 bucks?
[30:20.63]Where's the big money?
[30:23.44]You can upgrade the dog?
[30:24.60]Oh, yeah.
[30:26.84]Dog is very upgradable.
[30:36.57]Has he done the Armin impression yet?
[30:44.07]Not yet.
[30:54.18]Something's coming my way.
[30:58.76]I would say that's a fucking victory royale coming my way.
[31:16.98]I can't make a reference to my, like, epic game's name?
[31:20.52]Why not?
[31:21.00]Oh, shit.
[31:36.75]Balvarine.
[31:37.29]Oh, shit.
[32:01.27]And... Sealand.
[32:05.68]Oh, there's a huge bonus coming up here.
[32:11.44]What kind of bonus was that?
[32:12.30]150%.
[32:12.36]I probably should... No, let's go towards the actual mission, please.
[32:20.49]Is this the way?
[32:25.48]There we go.
[32:32.16]You think you're good at this game?
[32:33.26]I don't think you can be good at this game.
[32:35.76]The fighting and the combat in this game is sort of just there for you to get to the next part where you fart in front of a crowd of people.
[32:43.49]It's fun to play.
[32:44.61]It's fun.
[32:45.71]How's this?
[32:53.25]You found an empty statue.
[32:55.09]Oh, shit.
[32:56.01]Perfect.
[33:05.91]What's going on?
[33:12.75]Why is it doing this?
[33:14.17]Oh my god, I didn't even see them.
[33:15.43]What?
[33:16.27]What happened?
[33:16.85]I couldn't even tell they were there.
[33:19.75]That was really weird.
[33:20.77]Don't let him go.
[33:38.81]I need 10,000.
[33:40.20]I need 14,000 to get to Blades 3.
[33:53.16]This friend just got downed.
[33:54.53]Oh, I see what you mean.
[33:58.55]Alright, dig.
[34:07.38]Where is it?
[34:08.70]You got it?
[34:09.02]You can do it.
[34:14.01]Come on.
[34:16.27]He's finding it.
[34:17.47]Yeah, there we go.
[34:28.21]More condoms.
[34:37.19]How come the sus guy is not doing the voice today?
[34:39.23]What voice?
[34:39.71]Doesn't the sus guy not have a voice?
[34:44.89]It's just... It's just the face, right?
[34:49.14]It's the boss?
[35:02.07]Oh, balvarines.
[35:05.82]I just want to see a Balvarine so I can just stop saying Balvarine.
[35:09.72]Oh shit, this is the real deal.
[35:19.10]Save Garth.
[35:21.26]On it.
[35:27.94]Ow.
[35:30.63]Watch it!
[35:33.79]See, imagine if the game was like Dark Souls and it was played like this, but it was Fable Dark Souls.
[35:38.97]Microsoft, just make another one.
[35:40.37]Everybody's copying fucking FromSoftware.
[35:42.47]Like nobody, it doesn't matter anymore.
[35:45.15]FromSoftware just took the model and made it like really cool and interesting.
[35:48.14]Just copy it.
[35:48.82]Like everybody's doing it.
[35:49.92]Every single game company now is like making their own like Dark Souls system.
[35:53.20]Just put it in.
[35:53.88]Just do it.
[35:54.32]Just make Fable 4 and make it a Dark Souls game.
[36:06.41]a new fable.
[36:07.19]Yeah, but it has to be a Dark Souls copy, otherwise I won't be happy with it.
[36:20.78]Maybe Elden Ring will be like that, maybe.
[36:34.30]It's the racing game people that are making the new one.
[36:36.70]What do you mean, the racing game?
[36:48.14]Big finish.
[36:49.02]It's the Forza devs.
[36:50.16]Uhh...
[37:05.97]I mean, look, they might do a really good job.
[37:09.46]I can't... I'm not going to be one of those people that goes, Oh, they're a racing game dev?
[37:13.66]They'll never do a fun video game ever.
[37:15.94]That's not a car game.
[37:18.32]I'm not going to say that because I don't know.
[37:28.71]For all we know, the lead designer of Forza has been waiting to make a Fable game his entire life.
[37:37.41]You want me to, like, pass judgment on something that doesn't exist yet?
[37:39.65]Somebody leaked the Elden Ring investor trailer.
[37:54.47]Wait, what?
[37:55.67]Investor trailer?
[38:05.38]That doesn't make any sense.
[38:08.35]FromSoftware is not a publicly traded company.
[38:12.89]They're not... What do you mean investing like trailer?
[38:18.42]A private investor?
[38:28.66]It's literally true.
[38:38.68]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[38:42.50]Holy shit, eat!
[38:46.37]What am I doing?
[38:52.75]Oh, I didn't want to do that.
[38:57.91]Where's my, um... How did this change?
[39:09.20]Ooh, that was cool.
[39:10.20]That was really cool.
[39:11.04]This game's fun.
[39:11.50]Ooh.
[39:40.31]And Flourish.
[39:43.45]That was fun.
[39:46.59]Okay.
[39:48.05]How we doing?
[39:51.37]Is this worth playing?
[39:52.63]Yeah.
[39:53.23]I think so.
[39:56.83]I would say Fable is an experience worth playing.
[40:01.30]How was that?
[40:12.97]I'm coming, Garth.
[40:15.87]You think I'm scared of you?
[40:18.93]You're a freak.
[40:20.71]Lucian's failed experiment.
[40:23.11]Nothing more.
[40:25.29]You left too soon, Garth.
[40:27.15]Lord Lucian's experiment was a radical success.
[40:32.49]No.
[40:35.63]You are coming with me.
[40:42.81]They got him.
[40:43.33]OK, but first, let me check and see if there's any valuable.
[40:52.02]No?
[41:15.77]You guys tell me, like, fecal funny.
[41:18.41]What do you mean, trespassing?
[41:22.31]Alright, let's head back to the guild. ...
[41:46.88]Eagle funny.
[41:47.38]Haha, look it up.
[41:47.98]Alright, where is he?
[41:55.28]Sounds like you could have used my help after all.
[41:57.20]I knew I should have come.
[41:59.54]We cannot allow Lucian to keep Garth.
[42:01.86]You must get him out of there.
[42:04.20]There being a spire?
[42:06.16]Wait, a spire the... Oh, it's the sound of your own heartbeat.
[42:10.54]There is one who might know.
[42:13.07]When Lucian left for the Spire, he essentially abandoned his staff.
[42:17.53]His old butler, Jeeves, now spends his days at the Cowan Corset.
[42:22.41]His butler?
[42:23.86]I bet he saw his fair share of dirty dealings.
[42:27.36]Well, if it means a trip to the pub, we'll just have to make that sacrifice.
[42:30.44]Fortnite, like Minecraft, I think is going to be around for a long time.
[42:32.76]The task requires tact and delicacy.
[42:35.04]Something I believe you aren't familiar with.
[42:43.98]No?
[42:50.92]You literally asked this last week.
[42:52.60]I'm still... I'm just checking.
[42:54.29]Anyone playing Battleship yet?
[43:02.57]I have to check in on that every, like, month or so, too.
[43:04.73]No?
[43:05.17]Not yet?
[43:05.78]Okay.
[43:05.90]Okay.
[43:13.92]I'm telling you, just look, just wait for the YouTube thumbnails of like the battleship in the middle and two like popular YouTubers or streamers both like freaking out in the thumbnail.
[43:23.26]Like, oh my God, I can't believe that move.
[43:26.22]It's going to be battleship.
[43:27.12]I'm telling you.
[43:47.28]Battleship.
[43:54.21]Battleship has no strategy.
[43:58.13]So?
[44:01.19]And yes it does.
[44:03.81]How does it not have strategy?
[44:16.09]Oh, this person has a gift.
[44:18.19]What do I need to do?
[44:19.03]Oh, almost there.
[44:19.59]Hold on.
[44:24.37]Of course it has strategy.
[44:26.41]Good.
[44:31.41]Minesweeper has more strategy than Battleship?
[44:37.49]Let me ask you this question.
[44:39.41]Does Mario Party have more strategy than Battleship?
[44:43.83]Look at you go.
[44:50.16]Yes.
[44:53.41]25% discount of the whole... Really?
[44:54.89]Nice.
[44:56.43]You only have three items.
[45:07.65]Should I try to do like Jack Sparrow?
[45:18.64]There's so many ways to reduce RNG in Mario Party.
[45:35.07]Archmage robes.
[45:36.73]That's what those are.
[45:55.96]Okay, I like this.
[46:08.85]This looks very odd.
[46:09.85]Oh, hold on.
[46:21.43]It's like I'm a pirate that got clothing that was five sizes too small.
[46:28.00]I was last in line to get my pirate uniform.
[46:30.88]I'm sorry, Dave.
[46:31.64]All we have are extra smalls.
[46:43.28]Kill it.
[46:52.80]I feel like this character, like, kind of talks like a baby.
[46:57.02]Like, he's like the big dumb guy.
[46:58.70]Yeah, I guess I want to go that way, boss.
[47:02.94]That's what Peter Griffin's based off of.
[47:04.52]That character.
[47:07.68]That, like, Looney Tunes character is who Peter Griffin's voice is based off of.
[47:10.82]Listen to it.
[47:12.82]I think that guy actually says that.
[47:14.46]I think he's like, oh, boy, I don't know what I'm doing.
[47:18.06]I think that's Peter Griffin.
[47:30.76]It's a Boston accent, genius.
[47:33.32]I have no idea.
[47:33.88]I'm not, like, from that area.
[47:35.46]I have no idea.
[47:36.48]Never been there before.
[47:38.67]I spent 30 fucking years in Boston.
[47:41.49]I don't even know what that is.
[47:43.49]What town?
[47:43.91]What city is that?
[48:00.26]I know it's Rhode Island, yeah, but it's New England.
[48:02.86]It's the Boston accent.
[48:03.96]It's a New England accent.
[48:05.50]Look, I know it's Rhode Island.
[48:06.86]It's Poitucket, Rhode Island.
[48:08.60]That's a Boston accent that Peter Griffin has.
[48:15.08]What happened to your Boston accent?
[48:16.86]Um...
[48:29.40]What am I doing in here?
[48:30.30]What is everybody doing in here?
[48:33.50]I'm trying to do a quest.
[48:36.87]The whole town is coming in here.
[48:38.05]Wait, let me pay.
[48:39.63]I apparently offended that person.
[48:40.97]I don't even know what I did.
[49:02.11]1,000 gold pieces and not a penny less.
[49:06.15]It's my final offer.
[49:07.59]Take it or leave it.
[49:10.23]Lucian's diary is a riveting read, I assure you.
[49:13.85]I'm sure some private collector will make a nice place for it in his equally private home.
[49:19.30]Oh, we're shooting this guy in the head?
[49:21.24]Unless you've got a proposition, I suggest you leave me to my whiskey.
[49:37.29]You will do well to mind your manners.
[49:50.40]Honey, you don't... Please, you don't want to be in here.
[49:53.60]Get out of here.
[49:54.14]I'm, like, I'm doing something.
[49:56.54]You don't... I don't want you to know what I do for work.
[49:59.40]You think I put this fucking mask on?
[50:00.84]What do you think I do?
[50:02.40]Go work at the fucking, like...
[50:05.17]Grocery store.
[50:06.49]Get out of here.
[50:07.15]I'm trying to do something.
[50:11.45]Where were we?
[50:17.31]Come on.
[50:17.81]I haven't got all day.
[50:18.79]I want to like fucking punch him.
[50:26.81]Do I have to pay him?
[50:44.49]That extra animation.
[50:47.99]Dog, get him.
[50:58.09]I think I have to pay him.
[51:00.89]I don't think I think I have to pay him.
[51:05.23]I am not amused.
[51:18.56]That is not proper.
[51:20.32]I have I have to pay him.
[51:25.24]If you're not careful, you may find yourself back on the street.
[51:29.11]Fine.
[51:29.97]Here's a thousand dollars.
[51:31.27]I'm just tuning her out.
[51:35.61]I want to hear what she's saying.
[51:37.71]What the fuck?
[51:38.51]I want to hear what she's saying.
[51:43.74]I want to be able to hear it.
[52:00.40]Okay, let's go.
[52:01.40]What?
[52:02.20]What do you want?
[52:03.14]What?
[52:34.46]I can't shoot her.
[52:36.16]I can't.
[52:36.60]I'm sorry.
[52:37.06]I told you to get out of here.
[52:40.74]You don't want to see what I'm doing.
[52:42.04]Can I take that money back?
[52:44.98]You're horrible.
[52:45.80]I didn't do anything, okay?
[52:47.32]I shot that guy because he was dick and I didn't want to pay him.
[52:51.49]I didn't ruin everything.
[52:52.33]I'm fine.
[52:54.74]I need to put the gun away.
[52:56.54]You got the money?
[52:57.16]I want to put the gun down.
[53:01.50]Put the gun down.
[53:02.55]Put the gun.
[53:03.97]What's the put gun away move?
[53:08.95]Put the gun down.
[53:09.81]Hide so they can't see me.
[53:10.99]Oh my god, get out of here.
[53:13.91]What are you doing?
[53:14.93]Oh shit, right.
[53:19.13]Can they see me?
[53:23.50]No, I didn't.
[53:31.06]What happened?
[53:37.66]What happened?
[53:39.00]Oh my God.
[53:52.13]I played football when I was 12.
[53:55.63]I know all the jukes.
[54:05.73]I can't believe my wife left me because I shot a guy.
[54:32.90]Why was she even there?
[54:34.34]What was the... I get to rent my... Wait, where's the baby?
[54:36.60]Where's the baby?
[54:43.10]What happened?
[54:43.42]Is the baby still here?
[54:51.79]Hey!
[54:52.21]She took the kids.
[54:53.35]Oh.
[54:55.49]Well, I didn't want her to see that.
[55:03.59]Alright, anyways.
[55:04.23]What's the next mission?

[55:14.86]Uh-oh.
[55:15.98]Okay, we gotta do some... Go donate to the church.
[55:18.87]I'm gonna go donate to the church right now.
[55:27.63]I've got a bunch of money.
[55:28.47]I'm gonna go donate to the church.

[56:18.93]Okay, I'm here to donate money to the church.
[56:35.90]I will.
[56:43.35]Each donation will bring you wisdom and peace of mind.
[56:48.02]Anybody got a sander?
[56:49.22]Can I just lean down?
[56:52.34]I just need to borrow a sander for a little bit.
[56:53.84]I gotta sand something off my head.
[56:54.86]Okay.
[56:56.34]How much do I need to give to be a good person?
[56:59.00]Do I... You?
[56:59.45]What?
[56:59.61]What?
[57:10.46]What?
[57:11.14]Wait, they know I'm a murderer?
[57:12.74]How?
[57:12.92]How do I donate?
[57:13.82]Turn safety on?
[57:15.26]How do I donate?
[57:15.88]Play the loot?
[57:17.08]Is this a donation?
[57:47.57]Okay, I can't donate to the church.
[57:49.53]Why?
[57:51.79]Stand in the light and donate.
[57:55.51]What's going on?
[57:55.93]Yeah, you, if you say that again.
[58:06.61]Why would you walk up to a murderer and say, oh, what, you're looking to murder some more people, murderer?
[58:11.98]You gonna murder me?
[58:14.04]Don't do that to a fucking murderer.
[58:16.00]A guy that's like, will just kill people for no reason.
[58:17.64]What are you doing?
[58:20.22]Oh, look, it's the murderer.
[58:21.96]Oh, yes, sir.
[58:22.64]It's the guy with the gun.
[58:24.02]Uh, I think this is bugged.
[58:24.80]Go to the bowl?
[58:42.53]How much should I give?
[58:49.13]How much money does it take for me to bring my... 5 grand?
[58:51.97]10,000?
[58:52.07]I'm not going to give all of it.
[59:02.34]I want to have some money.
[59:18.78]You want to be good, give 10k.
[59:19.80]Okay.
[59:28.07]Now I have to go backwards.
[59:28.97]I went a little too far.
[59:29.79]This is just like when I'm at the fucking gas station and I want to do an exact even number and it ends up like that.
[59:34.76]It's like, fuck!
[59:41.34]Give 666. 666.
[59:46.89]Alright.
[59:48.45]75 good points.
[59:48.95]When's the holy hour?
[59:49.91]Make a large donation when the mystical sun reaches its zenith.
[59:52.23]What does that mean?
[60:23.24]Between 12 and 1?
[60:25.00]How do I know what time it is?
[60:28.40]Oh, okay.
[60:28.94]So between 12 and 1.
[60:30.03]Alright, I need to make more money.
[60:32.43]Alright, let's go make money.
[60:33.29]I'm going to be a blacksmith for a little bit.
[60:35.07]Sorry.
[60:36.01]I know this is supposed to be me actually doing quests, but it's too bad.
[60:38.33]I killed a guy.
[60:38.87]Bartender?
[60:45.60]Oh shit, I want to do this.
[60:55.77]I need to donate 10k.
[60:57.47]Okay.
[61:12.30]Alright, I want to go do the bartending.
[61:16.06]Alright, bartender.
[61:22.18]How does this work?
[61:25.96]to serve.
[61:27.59]It just has to be green?
[61:29.17]Alright, this is easy.
[61:37.77]Old multiplier.
[61:38.43]Don't you feel like if anyone ever did that, the ship would just fucking fall over halfway and get everywhere?
[61:56.93]That stuff doesn't... You can't really do this, can you?
[62:00.95]I feel like that would fall over halfway and hit like the four or five people at the bar and go all over them.
[62:08.01]Can you actually do this?
[62:18.90]My stomach just hangs over.
[62:20.18]I'm balancing it on my stomach.
[62:28.56]How much more do I have to do?
[62:30.37]Nine bucks?
[62:32.07]This sucks.
[62:32.79]Why would I do this?
[62:33.57]Just go be a blacksmith.
[62:35.11]I can make $10,000 in five minutes.
[62:43.41]Bar has to be waxed.
[62:44.72]Oh, that makes sense.
[62:45.42]Because you're level one.
[62:58.78]Yeah, but I mean, 12 bucks?
[63:00.28]Level 5 would be what, like 50?
[63:02.67]100?
[63:02.71]Should I level this up?
[63:04.57]Bartender makes money faster.
[63:05.45]Okay.
[63:05.57]Level 2 bartender.
[63:28.90]You're comparing an entry-level barkeep to a master blacksmith.
[63:35.00]I know, but is it going to be worth it in the end?
[63:41.88]Gambling will pay the most.
[63:45.85]Do they have a version of Blackjack or something?
[63:55.19]They do.
[63:57.07]Where is it?
[64:00.13]I don't like roulette.
[64:03.85]Roulette, I don't know.
[64:08.98]It was murder.
[64:13.90]Plain and simple.
[64:17.44]Oh, me?
[64:18.48]Yeah.
[64:19.70]But here's the best part.
[64:20.84]Nobody knows who I am because I have a mask on.
[64:24.44]Never taking it off.
[64:26.45]Just the right amount of
[64:28.21]Oh yeah, I did kill your friend.
[64:29.52]You'll never know who I am.
[64:43.82]You're the fattest guy in town.
[64:45.38]I think the blacksmith is a very large man.
[64:51.88]Yeah, I don't think so.
[65:02.30]Holy shit.
[65:02.90]No!
[65:03.36]That was perfect!
[65:04.64]What?
[65:04.94]It's perfect!
[65:08.39]That was perfect.
[65:09.19]Do you see how perfect that was?
[65:11.27]It was all the way at the end.
[65:12.45]Perfect.
[65:14.00]What the hell?
[65:19.78]Nice point.
[65:26.00]Oh, wasted beer.
[65:27.18]Oh, man.
[65:28.08]Is there anything more tragic than a wasted beer?
[65:31.28]Oh, man.
[65:32.08]Dropping it.
[65:32.94]Oh, fuck, dude.
[65:34.06]Wasted beer.
[65:34.86]What a foul.
[65:36.16]Nothing worse than a wasted beer.
[65:44.45]Your cousin from Boston.
[66:03.95]Like pub games Hey, look I've paid okay, they I've got they came to me they said you can either go to jail or Pay a fine.
[66:16.18]I paid the fine.
[66:17.10]I
[66:22.45]And lady, don't want to be like a little, I don't want to have to tell you this, but I've got $10,000 in my pocket right now.
[66:30.29]It was $1,600 for murder.
[66:32.07]I gotta, that means I can kill eight people in this room right now.
[66:41.01]Watch it.
[66:48.39]Is there anyone that wants to come up to me and be like, oh, you fucking bastard.
[66:51.55]I would take you back and I'd shoot you.
[66:53.39]Would you?
[66:53.93]Okay.
[66:55.09]Do you have $1,600?
[66:55.43]Because if you do, then just pull the trigger.
[66:58.90]Because that's what it costs to murder an Albion.
[67:17.03]That's the cost of killing somebody.
[67:24.90]You forgot about the 10k you spent on the church for forgiveness.
[67:33.28]Well, I didn't have to do that.
[67:36.81]Wait, the cost is 500.
[67:37.91]It was 1600 because you killed three people.
[67:40.57]Wait, was it?
[67:42.97]Okay, so let me rephrase that.
[67:45.84]It's $500.
[67:46.36]Now, okay, you do the math.
[67:50.10]It's 27 coin for one of these beers.
[67:56.54]So... So, in the amount of time it takes for you to drink 15 of these beers, you could have already killed me and gotten away with it.
[68:08.55]Let that sink in, everybody here.
[68:13.11]Pouring 18 beers per murder Just the right amount of foam Just the right amount of foam Stalls now opening for business This job sucks go gamble.
[68:37.24]Actually, this is pretty good actually looking pint.
[68:39.90]Oh
[68:40.44]I can see how this being, this would be like a hundred bucks.
[68:43.71]Yeah, I'm getting this level five.
[68:46.81]Nice point.
[68:54.99]Your character looks like my drunk uncle cosplaying as Raphael from the Ninja Turtles.
[69:04.05]That's a wonderfully poured pint.
[69:11.16]6,500 gold till promotion.
[69:13.36]How long is this going to take?
[69:14.66]108?
[69:16.34]Oh, this is going to take forever.
[69:18.44]This is going to take forever.
[69:19.42]Gold multiplier is only 5.
[69:23.26]That's it?
[69:25.14]Okay, no.
[69:39.17]I'm watching someone else press A every two seconds repeatedly.
[69:47.80]What am I doing with my life?
[69:50.64]Um, we're just hanging out.
[69:53.28]Man, we're just hanging out here.
[69:56.21]The right amount of foam is no foam.
[70:00.81]Can we talk about foam for a second?
[70:06.71]I, I, I want it.
[70:08.05]I like, you know, like in cartoons and TV shows and movies and literally this video game you're looking at right now.
[70:14.84]The big tankard with the root beer or the beer that has like the big like whipped cream kind of foam all over it.
[70:20.36]I wish that existed.
[70:21.82]Like I want a huge like goofy whipped cream big foam on top of my drinks like that.
[70:36.85]You can never get it.
[70:38.82]It does.
[70:42.72]Guinness.
[70:43.20]Yeah, but Guinness is gross.
[70:44.30]Guinness is liquid bread.
[70:46.26]It's disgusting.
[70:46.96]I'm sorry.
[70:55.06]I know everyone loves Guinness.
[71:02.55]Yes.
[71:02.83]Oh, Guinness.
[71:03.63]You gotta get Guinness.
[71:04.45]Guinness.
[71:05.86]Oh, yeah.
[71:06.36]When I take a sip of Guinness, I feel like I have to chew Guinness.
[71:10.98]Look at the head on that.
[71:12.70]Lovely.
[71:14.48]It's too much.
[71:19.35]Nice pint.
[71:21.71]Guinness, to me, kind of has the same look and feel and taste as the thing you tar your driveway with.
[71:27.61]A delicious looking pint.
[71:30.73]Need a distraction from your...
[71:37.70]I don't drink beer.
[71:38.68]I'm not a beer drinker.
[71:39.66]Okay?
[71:41.76]Everyone's like, I'm seeing it right now.
[71:43.47]Oh, he's like, he likes the American stuff.
[71:45.99]Oh, Bud Light.
[71:46.91]No, Bud Light is gross too.
[71:54.62]To me, Bud Light is the opposite side of the spectrum.
[71:58.26]Where you have... You know like those food coloring little droplets?
[72:02.08]Where you fill up a bunch of soda water and you have a beer-flavored food coloring dropper.
[72:08.08]And you like... And Ster it in.
[72:10.47]I just... I don't like beer.
[72:21.05]I really just don't.
[72:26.19]Somebody said Blue Moon.
[72:26.85]Blue Moon's actually okay.
[72:27.67]I actually don't hate Blue Moon.
[72:31.35]But Blue Moon is the hangover beer, isn't it?
[72:41.73]Bud Light's the only beer I've ever finished.
[72:46.62]I've never finished, though.
[72:49.57]Yeah, because when you get to the end of a Bud Light, it's kind of like, it's kind of gross.
[72:53.86]It kind of, it feels like, alright, I'm going to be kind of, people are going to be grossed out by this, but I have to say it.
[72:59.40]I'm going to say it.
[72:59.88]So just I'm going to say something gross.
[73:01.54]Every time I've ever gotten to the bottom of a beer, like the last three or four sips of a beer, I'm talking maybe like an inch at the bottom of the glass or the bottle.
[73:10.41]To me, it's as if somebody swished it around in their mouth and spit it back into the glass.
[73:16.45]I can, I can never finish a beer.
[73:22.48]I just can't do it.
[73:32.65]You know what beer that I actually kind of really liked?
[73:37.79]It was this beer, and I know I'm... Look, everyone's going to laugh because it's like the name of the beer.
[73:42.31]It was this microbrewery.
[73:43.99]What the hell was it called?
[73:46.69]Circus Boy.
[73:47.39]It was from Magic Hat, right?
[73:50.82]That was cool.
[73:51.48]It was like this unfiltered Hefenweizen.
[73:53.64]I remember I tried it one time and I was like, this is actually fucking kind of cool.
[74:01.52]This is kind of good.
[74:02.32]It was called Circus Boy.
[74:07.06]Yes, Hefenweizen.
[74:07.80]Am I saying that right?
[74:08.60]Hefenweizen?
[74:09.94]Hefenweizer.
[74:11.98]Okay.
[74:13.62]What does that mean?
[74:14.20]I like Hefenweizens.
[74:20.35]Someone explain to me what I like.
[74:23.97]You drink IPAs?
[74:25.09]No.
[74:26.27]FNW's in his god tier.
[74:32.27]But what is it though?
[74:33.83]So when I order a beer, what do I know that I like?
[74:36.86]I don't like the liquid bread.
[74:37.88]I don't like the food coloring flavoring.
[74:40.82]It's a Belgian beer.
[74:41.96]So I need to order Belgian beer.
[74:43.54]It's a wheat beer.
[74:44.38]Okay.
[74:50.25]Yeast and wheat, okay.
[74:52.76]Your cousin from Boston.
[74:57.84]Well, that's what I like.
[74:58.74]That's the beer that I like.
[75:00.60]This actually is making a shitload of money.
[75:15.41]Blue Moon is a wheat beer.
[75:16.84]Oh, okay.
[75:17.96]That's why I like it.
[75:21.48]It's a really common Jerma Bavarian beer.
[75:23.30]Alright.
[75:23.64]Well, that's what I like.
[75:24.28]Try Corona.
[75:30.26]I actually don't... I'm not a big Corona.
[75:32.74]I don't like Corona.
[75:37.98]I don't... It's okay.
[75:41.82]What?
[75:42.48]No.
[75:43.18]Fuck that.
[75:44.02]I did it.
[75:46.60]Dipshit American.
[75:47.74]It's not pronounced that way.
[75:49.25]Okay.
[75:49.61]Sorry.
[75:54.66]You're now at two beers per murder.
[75:56.82]I'm a wine drinker.
[75:57.86]You all know that.
[75:58.38]I like wine.
[76:05.06]I like whiskey.
[76:05.48]I like vodka.
[76:16.87]But there's an asterisk on vodka.
[76:19.52]Because there's a lot of disgusting, just gross, cheap vodka that smells and tastes like nail polish.
[76:27.48]Just nail polish remover.
[76:31.72]A good vodka is good.
[76:35.30]But there's a certain level where it's undrinkable, in my opinion, even when you mix it.
[76:39.44]Nice pint.
[76:42.25]I remember I had a screwdriver one time with like gross cheap vodka and it ruined orange juice for about 10 years for me.
[76:47.99]I couldn't drink orange juice anymore.
[76:50.35]It just, it was such a disgusting fucking rancid beverage.
[76:54.33]It was, it was disgusting.
[76:57.52]I could not drink orange juice for like 10 straight years.
[77:08.00]Do I like flavored vodka?
[77:09.78]No, not really.
[77:11.22]I just like a nice, like decent quality vodka.
[77:14.12]Doesn't have to be like super high quality, but good enough.
[77:17.34]So it's not going to ruin the drink.
[77:27.67]Odd vodka is the same, Jeremy.
[77:29.43]It's not.
[77:34.62]Whiskey's the grossest thing in the world.
[77:37.10]Well, look, I have had whiskeys before that somebody's like, oh man, you should try this.
[77:43.41]It's got a really smoky flavor.
[77:45.33]You're gonna love it.
[77:45.93]It's very smoky and it's got hints of almond and I take a little sip and it tastes as if somebody ashed a cigar in my mouth.
[77:55.32]No exaggeration.
[77:56.94]Someone ashed a cigarette into my mouth.
[77:59.56]It's fucking disgusting.
[78:02.50]A delicious looking pint.
[78:05.51]But there's other whiskies that are fine.
[78:07.43]They taste good.
[78:08.17]They're smooth.
[78:09.07]They have like a nice flavor profile to them.
[78:15.23]That's me with bourbon.
[78:19.41]That's why it's good.
[78:20.91]Palate of a 16-year-old.
[78:23.63]Ashing a cigar in my mouth is not- how is that a 16- I didn't say I like ordering mac and cheese and chicken fingers off the kids menu.
[78:31.90]I don't like really smoky like cigar fucking whiskeys.
[78:35.84]I actually don't like rum.
[78:46.04]I'm actually not a big spiced rum fan either.
[78:50.46]Spiced rum to me tastes like they're hiding something.
[78:55.49]I feel like it's been flavored and spiced to a point where you don't, like, you don't taste what it really tastes like, which is bad.
[79:02.87]I feel like it's like hiding something gross.
[79:04.95]I don't know why.
[79:05.45]That's what I feel like.
[79:06.27]I have $25,000.
[79:08.14]What happened?
[79:08.74]What?
[79:09.00]Oh my god.
[79:09.20]What about gin?
[79:09.74]Okay.
[79:09.94]Okay.
[79:21.35]Uh, gin is awful.
[79:24.95]Gin might be the worst of all of them.
[79:29.15]Gin just tastes like pine salt.
[79:32.35]Gin tastes like car air freshener.
[79:34.51]No.
[79:40.19]I don't think anybody... No.
[79:42.21]Gin is one of those things that I think is very specific.
[79:45.10]And by the way, gin and tonic...
[79:47.84]Reminds me of the thing that, like, they would give fucking patients back in, like, the 1400s at the doctor's office.
[79:55.74]It's awful.
[79:56.84]It's just awful.
[79:57.88]It just tastes awful.
[79:59.30]It's awful.
[80:01.98]Oh, you know what kind of drink I want?
[80:03.32]The shit that they used to give people before they sawed their legs off in, like, the fucking 1200s.
[80:08.11]No.
[80:08.53]Why would... Do we have so many options?
[80:10.81]Why would you choose that one?
[80:14.17]You have so many choices.
[80:15.35]Why choose that?
[80:23.78]Drinking is immoral.
[80:26.04]Yeah, kind of.
[80:30.08]How do I feel about tequila?
[80:33.40]I think a good tequila is okay.
[80:41.00]I think tequila has that same kind of gross spectrum that vodka has.
[80:46.65]Really, really like kind of shitty tequila is the same thing as drinking the really shitty vodka.
[80:51.13]It's awful.
[80:54.82]I think tequila is good mixed with certain things.
[80:57.90]I don't, I would never drink tequila.
[81:00.00]Like, I mean, why would you ever drink tequila straight?
[81:03.54]Why would you drink vodka straight either?
[81:05.16]But, like, a vodka soda is essentially drinking vodka without anything in it.
[81:10.77]A vodka soda with, like, a lime in it or something, or a vodka, like, with cranberry.
[81:15.13]That's pretty, pretty close.
[81:24.89]Fuck, I wasn't paying attention.
[81:26.21]I'll get it.
[81:28.28]Moscow Mule?
[81:29.02]Moscow Mules are amazing.
[81:30.50]I love them.
[81:31.26]A really good Moscow Mule is awesome.
[81:33.88]I mean, I haven't drank alcohol in a very long time, but, you know, I'm just talking here.
[81:38.62]If I were to think of my favorite drink, like what I would order and be happy with pretty much anywhere, it would probably be a Moscow Mule.
[81:50.67]Or a vodka pineapple.
[81:52.13]Those are the only two drinks that I would, like, comfortably order anywhere and be like, okay, I will probably like this.
[82:04.31]Anything else, I would be like, eh.
[82:07.00]Lots of places have their own little drink menus where it's like, oh, here's our, uh, the special, the special, like, uh...
[82:15.11]I can't even like I can't think of two like dumb like words that don't mean here's our uh the sunrise into the Sunset I don't know what if they have the fucking dumb list and have the names or the L the Albert Einstein sunrise, right?
[82:32.74]I Don't but I don't order those I think they're a little too complicated It's like all like famous person and like a time of day I
[82:43.43]I don't order the famous person and time of day or weather drinks.
[82:50.92]Be careful.
[82:54.94]Nice point.
[82:56.40]Yeah, let go.
[83:02.95]It's Nikolai Tesla's.
[83:06.21]Raindrops.
[83:06.95]Like, I don't know.
[83:08.05]I'm sorry.
[83:14.68]Cathy Mitchell's Express 101.
[83:16.84]I mean, I would absolutely... I would order that.
[83:19.18]That sounds amazing.
[83:22.73]Why does this keep happening?
[83:28.99]Are they going to need batteries?
[83:35.63]Would you order a cloudy sandler?
[83:39.19]No.
[83:40.67]That's breaking the rule of famous person and weather or time of day.
[83:46.19]I don't order those.
[83:47.45]What about absinthe?
[84:01.95]I've never had absinthe before.
[84:07.24]I kind of don't want it.
[84:08.00]Kind of scary.
[84:12.48]Because I know it's like, oh, yeah, well, absence.
[84:14.18]Back in the day, they used to put, oh, like, this, like, weird thing in it that made you, like, hallucinate.
[84:19.64]I don't want that.
[84:20.30]They don't do that anymore, right?
[84:23.28]But, like, I don't want it.
[84:27.75]That's not even true.
[84:29.83]I know, but it's like a weird, dumb, like, urban legend around it.
[84:35.95]Nice point.
[84:37.48]Yes, I know.
[84:37.98]I've read the chain email.
[84:39.82]And I, like, believe the chain email.
[84:41.40]But I don't know.
[84:42.80]And it's like, oh, what you have to do is you have to take a sugar cube, place it, like, five feet above your head, spin around, pour it over.
[84:48.74]No, I just want to drink the fucking drink.
[84:50.01]I don't know.
[84:50.83]I don't want to do that.
[84:58.57]Or adjective and animal.
[85:00.03]Yeah, that's another one.
[85:03.80]Adjective, animal, famous person, time of day, and weather.
[85:11.74]the the the the the the the Theodore Roosevelt nighttime Jack-o-lantern surprise bear you know I don't just add adjectives I'm trying to pay attention to the game you'll have to pay for that
[85:33.74]Somebody just said, we get it.
[85:36.60]I know.
[85:37.02]I'm just like, I'm trying to pass the time.
[85:39.90]That's every word combo?
[85:46.31]No, it's not.
[85:47.37]That's not every word combo.
[85:52.17]What would my drink be, though?
[86:00.78]What would the Jerma985 be?
[86:02.24]Let's figure that out.
[86:03.10]Okay, what would the Jerma985 be?
[86:05.00]It would start with some good quality Tito's vodka.
[86:14.41]You take the Tito's vodka, fill it up to about one, Two Fingers.
[86:18.97]Then, a splash of grenadine.
[86:22.39]And then, a little bit of soda water.
[86:24.95]And then, squeeze a lemon, squeeze a lime.
[86:31.74]Top it off with a little bit of pineapple juice.
[86:36.83]And then put it in the microwave.
[86:39.29]10 seconds.
[86:40.25]Take it out of the microwave.
[86:41.19]Put ice in it.
[86:42.97]Ster, Ster, Ster, Ster, Ster, Ster, Ster.
[86:44.27]Take the ice out.
[86:46.78]And then put parsley on it.
[86:48.66]Nice.
[86:58.70]Don't put it in the microwave.
[87:01.48]I just imagine like one of those, like in like a ceramic mug.
[87:09.37]Then light it on fire.
[87:10.43]No.
[87:11.41]And then throw it away.
[87:13.93]Throw it away.
[87:20.42]Have the trash get taken out.
[87:23.06]Drive behind the trash truck.
[87:27.61]It would have absorbed a bunch of other shit at that point.
[87:29.89]Scoop it out of the truck when it gets to the dump.
[87:33.01]Two ice cubes.
[87:34.23]Ster it up.
[87:34.65]Spin it up.
[87:35.01]Put it inside of one of those shakers.
[87:38.62]Bring it to a priest.
[87:39.10]They bless it.
[87:39.64]Gargle it.
[87:40.66]Gargle it.
[87:42.98]Gargle it.
[87:44.04]Fuck it.
[87:58.58]I'll have to charge you for that.
[88:00.79]Put it down the toilet.
[88:03.11]Lush the toilet.
[88:05.39]Put the cup down with the water swirling on the edge of the toilet to capture it.
[88:11.63]Onto the table.
[88:12.88]Another thing of parsley.
[88:17.50]And by the way, it's like $400.
[88:18.52]Nice point.
[88:28.35]We get it.
[88:28.95]Top it off with a sneeze.
[88:32.00]No.
[88:32.08]11,000 people are watching this shit.
[88:35.76]Okay.
[88:35.96]Look.
[88:36.12]I don't choose the people that are watching this stream.
[88:38.24]I'm just here.
[88:56.88]I can't, like, I'm sorry.
[88:58.92]I'm sorry that there's been people here.
[89:00.56]This bartender's crazy.
[89:09.39]This is just what I've been saying the whole time.
[89:16.13]I have 40,000 fucking dollars.
[89:18.06]This is insane.
[89:18.78]It's almost at level 5.
[89:28.39]By the way, don't make that drink.
[89:31.26]That's stupid.
[89:32.02]It's a dumb thing to do.
[89:32.92]Don't do it.
[89:33.48]That was a funny, like, fucking routine we were doing.
[89:37.12]That concludes the message.
[89:43.46]How would you even do that?
[89:46.63]I don't know.
[89:50.43]Now go gamble everything.
[89:51.77]Let me get to level 5.
[89:52.31]I'll have 40,000.
[89:52.57]I'll be good.
[89:56.77]Okay, I'm done.
[89:57.81]Let's go donate at 12 o'clock.
[90:03.57]I got 40 grand.
[90:05.67]Okay, we're good.
[90:14.91]Now let's go to the... Time.
[90:18.92]Let's see what we got.
[90:20.06]Quests.
[90:21.84]The bargain?
[90:24.46]Nope.
[90:25.93]It's, where is it?
[90:26.79]The harvest?
[90:27.81]No.
[90:28.17]Where is it?
[90:28.55]Donating to the light.
[90:29.21]There it is.
[90:31.05]Make a large donation when the mystical sun reaches its zenith.
[90:33.57]Here we go.
[90:47.71]Okay, everything before the microwave, that would be the Jerma985.
[90:52.60]What was it?
[90:53.40]It was a little bit of vodka, grenadine, soda water, squeeze a lemon, squeeze a lime, Ster it up.
[91:01.36]Maybe a little bit of pineapple juice or cranberry juice.
[91:03.02]Or both.
[91:03.60]Do both.
[91:03.94]That's it.
[91:19.69]Okay, what time is it?
[91:22.13]8.30am.
[91:22.55]Alright, how do I kill some time here?
[91:26.05]8.35, okay.
[91:27.73]Tito's Vodka?
[91:28.33]Yeah, that's good.
[91:29.81]Tito's is good.
[91:31.97]I think Tito's is a good brand.
[91:32.94]I like Gray Goose too, but Gray Goose is... I think Tito's is probably better than Gray Goose.
[91:40.46]Like in regards to value and... I think Tito's is a good brand, dude.
[91:45.98]The shops are now opening!
[91:54.41]9 a.m., alright.
[91:54.95]What can I do for like three hours?
[92:00.57]Well, somebody said he's a Gray Goose drinker.
[92:02.70]No, I just said that's like a... I would accept that if you handed me that.
[92:06.70]If you were like, hey, I'm going to make you a drink with Gray Goose.
[92:09.24]I'd be like, okay.
[92:11.24]I didn't say, please, I would love a Gray... Give me a Gray Goose.
[92:13.34]That's what I want.
[92:20.17]Go see your family, dude.
[92:21.49]My family doesn't exist.
[92:22.55]My wife left me and the kid, she took the kid.
[92:25.93]Just being factual.
[92:27.83]I don't have a family anymore.
[92:30.03]Wait, do I?
[92:32.21]Why would I have a family?

[103:08.12]Is it over here?
[103:08.74]I actually don't.
[103:09.82]I just forget where my house is.
[103:11.38]Over here.
[103:11.64]I'm about to shoot that guy.
[103:16.41]I'm about to turn safety off and shoot that guy.
[103:20.79]And then, when he's on the ground, I'm gonna go down on all fours and do the Stone Cold Steve Austin shake my fucking head talking into his face.
[103:29.83]Okay.

[104:54.00]That's what it's from.
[104:56.02]No, wait, it's just a stick.
[105:06.04]We are the servants of the light, banishing darkness from this world.
[105:09.78]The larger the donation, the holier the reward.
[105:13.32]Bert the monk.
[105:16.43]Once a murderer, always a murderer.
[105:19.17]Alex the monk?

[106:55.20]Come on.
[106:59.22]How about this?
[106:59.70]Oh, I'm a chicken.
[107:01.56]Robots.
[107:07.76]Can I do this for two hours straight?
[107:14.23]I don't get it.
[107:30.11]I quite simply hate it.
[107:31.97]What?
[107:33.93]I guess you're not as great as I thought you were.
[107:36.77]Really idiotic.
[107:38.83]Oh, will you stop that?
[107:44.17]I really don't like it.
[107:46.83]Oh, come on.
[107:47.25]Like, farting in church is like half of every stand-up comedian's fucking routine from like 20 years ago.
[107:54.11]Stop breathing.
[107:55.61]Start walking.
[107:57.17]Absolutely not to my liking.
[108:01.09]I'll just wait till I drop a stack of 10 grand over there.
[108:03.73]Okay, what time is it?
[108:08.47]It's time?
[108:09.09]Alright, here we go.
[108:11.07]11.53 AM.

[108:32.66]Let's go.
[108:33.30]$10k.
[108:33.36]Let's do it.
[108:38.06]I'm not giving it all.
[108:42.10]Why would I do that?
[109:08.71]Brilliant!
[109:13.61]What is that?
[109:13.99]The rising sun?
[109:15.69]What is that?
[109:17.67]You now have a weapon with augment slots.
[109:19.71]If any of them are empty, you can attach augments to endow it with unique power.
[109:24.43]The number of slots next to each item's name tells you how many augments it can hold.
[109:29.73]May its light dispense justice and keep you safe from harm.
[109:34.26]That's a pretty nice drink.
[109:37.48]Whoa, okay.
[109:38.76]Let me see what it is.
[109:42.06]Weapons.
[109:45.51]The Rising Sun.

[109:49.85]That is actually really good.
[109:53.33]Whoa.
[109:53.47]Whoa.

[110:05.04]Should I donate more?
[110:05.72]Should I donate another 10,000?
[110:06.94]Do I get more stuff?
[110:14.57]No.
[110:16.23]Well, I need to look at where I am here.
[110:18.21]How am I doing?
[110:20.85]My personality.
[110:22.85]Look, I'm so good now.
[110:28.11]Look at how much better that is.

[111:07.08]Donate all.
[111:07.90]I'm not going to donate.
[111:08.64]Alright.
[111:09.26]Whatever.
[111:09.62]This is fine.
[111:10.54]I'm now good enough to use the apologize expression?
[111:12.44]Apologize?
[111:12.76]What?
[111:12.96]I can do the Joker laugh?
[111:14.39]Okay.
[111:37.67]Cool.
[111:37.99]Alright.
[111:40.25]I'm very good.
[111:41.99]Was the expression sorry?
[111:43.23]Social.
[111:46.34]Thumbs up?
[111:46.88]No.
[111:48.52]Is it scary?
[111:51.14]No.
[111:51.64]Where is it?
[111:52.38]Rude.
[111:53.38]Chicken.
[111:53.74]Point and laugh.
[111:54.46]Fun.
[111:55.64]Where's sorry?
[111:56.34]I don't see sorry anywhere.
[112:07.19]Is it under social?
[112:07.97]We're sorry.
[112:10.96]It's not in the wheel.
[112:13.74]Okay.
[112:21.58]You need more practice!
[112:33.69]Okay.
[112:34.29]Let's go.
[112:37.89]can only apologize if you wait so I wait I can shoot somebody and apologize alright here we go I need that's about 11 12 000. why does your guy look like a villain from every kids TV show
[113:11.00]I have so many of these potions that I'm just going to keep forgetting they exist.
[113:14.78]That was such a huge amount of experience though.
[113:16.54]Okay.
[113:21.17]I can buy it now.
[113:25.29]Will.
[113:26.99]Blades 3.
[113:29.37]Let's do it.
[113:31.52]Your comprehension of the blade ability has increased significantly.
[113:34.88]I got blades 3 now.
[113:35.86]This thing is going to be insane.
[113:41.40]And we're gonna do... I might as well just do... Strength?
[113:46.24]And I have the... Yeah, I might as well.
[113:47.68]I have this new melee weapon.
[113:51.62]We should play the actual game.
[113:53.57]Here's the thing about Fable.
[113:55.69]This is the game.
[113:57.25]This is the actual game.
[114:00.25]Like, the story missions are probably the worst part of the whole experience.
[114:06.35]It's probably like a 5 out of 10.
[114:18.98]Okay, here we go.
[114:27.19]I'm going to do this.
[114:31.09]Is it better than pouring beers for an hour?
[114:33.33]That's the fable experience.
[114:45.54]Yeah, I'm sorry, though.
[114:46.58]I thought we had a pretty interesting conversation for that, like, beer podcast.
[114:59.65]Wait, even though... Why is she still here?
[115:00.91]Alright, you gotta... She has to go home.
[115:06.29]What did she say?
[115:06.91]Plant some what?
[115:10.84]What?
[115:10.98]You have to pick up your mind.
[115:12.30]Because you just said like, oh, we should go on a hike.
[115:17.38]Go to jail.
[115:19.60]What did I do?
[115:25.01]Look at her opinion of me.
[115:25.93]It's perfect.
[115:26.79]Why does she keep saying this?
[115:31.66]She, like, loves me.
[115:32.64]She thinks I'm funny.
[115:33.40]And she thinks, like, I'm, like, sweet.
[115:34.76]Why does she keep telling me to rot in jail?
[115:36.94]What the hell?
[115:37.54]Alright.
[115:46.33]I don't want you to die.
[115:47.09]Please don't.
[115:47.95]Please.
[115:48.17]I don't want this to happen.
[115:50.13]It's good to see you again.
[115:55.69]Don't follow me.
[115:57.19]I have to... I'm not having this happen again.
[116:01.91]You killed people.
[116:05.75]Guys, I really hate to, like, tell you how, like, the 1400s were.
[116:10.31]Have you seen an episode of Game of Thrones?
[116:13.28]People were just fucking murdering each other over, like, hams.
[116:17.94]I... Don't come down this road.
[116:31.87]A fight would break out over the fucking ham.
[116:34.13]Oh my god, somebody has a gun.
[116:47.37]Don't!
[116:49.89]Please go home.
[117:07.07]What does this do?
[117:07.59]This takes so long to fill up.
[117:21.09]I have to take her home.
[117:21.83]Follow me.
[117:26.27]I don't want you to die.
[117:26.89]Is that a bad guy?
[117:32.23]What are you doing?
[117:32.89]Okay, no, you're fine.
[117:36.39]I'm sure your donations will help a lot of people.
[117:41.22]It was murder.
[117:42.24]Plain and simple.
[117:43.96]What the hell?
[117:47.08]It's the medieval times.
[117:48.21]God damn it.
[117:50.13]What are you talking about?
[118:09.46]One of them was somebody extorting you.
[118:11.90]And they probably had a gun in their back pocket.
[118:24.47]It was murder plus one heart.
[118:32.83]Okay, here we go.
[118:35.09]Stay here.
[118:35.63]I don't want you to get hurt or killed or anything.
[118:39.99]I'll be back.
[118:40.39]See you later.
[118:48.05]Okay, now let's go.
[118:50.59]I really don't want her to die.
[118:58.05]In evil times doesn't mean murder is okay.
[118:59.71]Bandits are bad, but murdering people was still a very bad person behavior.
[119:06.28]Like people would just, people would fucking swing their axes at people.
[119:10.72]Yeah, murder was bad.
[119:11.72]It always has been bad.
[119:15.02]But I mean, I'm walking around with a fucking, like a sword and a gun on my back.
[119:18.88]And there are like bandits everywhere.
[119:31.06]Everybody does it so I, look, so this guy's shooting at me with a rifle.
[119:35.87]These people are just... Look at this.
[119:36.95]This is what the medieval times were like.
[119:38.29]Look at this.
[119:38.59]This is what it was like.
[119:39.23]Wait.
[119:49.77]Why did I lose so many points?
[119:54.64]What?
[119:54.98]What?
[119:55.32]What's going on?
[119:55.86]They have bandits.
[119:59.12]Do you want me not to do this?
[120:01.46]Did you just hit my dog?
[120:02.42]What's...
[120:07.28]That's not a civilian!
[120:09.10]That was not- Okay, that was not a civilian.
[120:10.90]That was a bandit.
[120:15.58]I know I have magical fucking daggers that come out of my hands.
[120:18.22]I'm talking about like the nature of- Medieval times, people with guns.
[120:31.99]No!
[120:33.81]You know what I'm trying to say.
[120:34.89]Alright, I gotta help this guy.
[120:38.69]I'm good.
[121:05.56]There were no streamers in the Middle Ages.
[121:07.14]Yeah, there were no iPhones either.
[121:08.22]There were no TVs.
[121:14.84]There were no treadmills.
[121:17.78]Oh, hold on.
[121:21.20]Oh, he didn't like that.
[121:24.70]Steel mace.
[121:25.52]No, I don't want this.
[121:26.44]Oh.
[121:36.99]Good observation.
[121:37.79]Yeah, there are no treadmills in the medieval ages, right?
[121:40.81]See, that's why I'm so big.
[121:44.93]Oh, the dog, by the way, has changed.
[121:46.13]Forest troll?
[121:54.37]Dog is a retriever?
[121:58.02]Defeat the troll.
[122:02.48]Yeah, the dog has changed into a golden retriever.
[122:15.79]I'm too, I'm too good.
[122:19.94]Watch out, dog.
[122:21.92]Alright, dead.
[122:33.75]Got it.
[122:35.55]We do a little trolling here.
[122:36.93]Ooh, nice.
[122:49.81]Oh, there's a dig spot.
[122:53.43]What's the... Okay, if you're evil, if you're actually all the way to the other end of the bar, what does the dog look like?
[123:05.52]Lucian's diary.
[123:12.34]Good work.
[123:13.73]But it will do you little good without a translation.
[123:16.69]Bring it back to the guild.
[123:20.46]Coming.
[123:23.96]This looks like it was meant to be an MMO.
[123:25.24]I... I mean, it was a pretty ambitious game for back, like, 12, 13 years ago.
[123:35.24]Longer than that, right?
[123:35.82]With 14?
[123:37.22]12 or 13.
[123:43.02]How you can determine how ambitious a game was is did it come out before or after GTA 4?
[123:50.36]GTA 4 ruined everything.
[123:52.90]GTA 4, I believe, was what?
[123:57.46]2007?
[123:57.48]2008?
[123:57.82]Like, if your game was not as good as GTA 4, holy shit, that changed everything.
[124:08.87]GTA 4's, like, ambitious game was like, if you thought you had an ambitious game and the game came out before GTA 4, maybe.
[124:16.34]Not after, though.
[124:32.07]you can read that but your eyes are you know I see other worlds than this ta4 sucked and in other worlds you can see I that's I don't understand that's a that's a troll you make it that's just westcliff lucian is recruiting guards from westcliff oh come on westcliff's a dump full of brawlers and thugs the only thing there is that arena
[124:58.33]Yeah, GTA 4 was one of the best games ever made.
[125:00.03]I think a lot of you guys forget the kind of interesting systems that were introduced in GTA 4.
[125:03.63]People being able to get, like...
[125:27.86]into fights and stuff without you having to do anything about it.
[125:31.24]People literally talking shit to each other, getting in car accidents and like a police showing up, but you didn't do anything.
[125:35.62]That was very, very different than anything we've been used to.
[125:51.20]Like the AI engine that they came up with for GTA 4 was better than anything else before it.
[126:15.59]It's the way that people move.
[126:17.99]Remember that, uh, there was that technology that I think Rockstar acquired.
[126:23.53]Where, like, bumping into stuff and the AI moving accordingly?
[126:29.40]What was it called?
[126:30.10]It was an actual technology about, like, AI reacting to things.
[126:34.54]Euphoria, right?
[126:35.46]Yep.
[126:39.58]The act of, like, bumping somebody with your car, and they interact with the car with their arms and legs and body, that was all AI.
[126:46.83]That was huge.
[126:48.89]That was ridiculous, because it was always just animations.
[126:51.65]It was like, oh, you got hit by the car, there's an animation that plays after you got hit, and it's pretty much the same animation every time.
[127:00.25]The Euphoria engine was just like, holy shit, wait, we can have people react to things the way they actually would if they got bumped, and it won't be just an animation that plays?
[127:11.65]That was a huge deal.
[127:18.30]No, not ragdolls.
[127:19.46]Ragdoll physics existed well before that.
[127:21.76]The act of the AI reacting to stuff randomly, if you bumped into them, if they were hit by something, it wasn't a ragdoll.
[127:31.43]It was the AI engine would react to getting touched in a certain way.
[127:44.96]If you have a few minutes, go look up the Euphoria engine.
[127:47.42]And you'll see what I'm talking about.
[127:48.52]It was revolutionary.
[127:50.35]No, not Ragdoll.
[127:51.19]Ragdoll is just the... Ragdoll is the whole rig just falls apart.
[127:53.93]Go look it up.
[128:12.71]Procedural animation.
[128:16.55]GTA 4 invented physics.
[128:18.81]You guys, get out of here.
[128:20.01]Okay.
[128:22.93]Let's go.
[128:26.72]Why can I not do more than 10 bucks?
[128:32.54]Ooh.
[128:33.86]I got nine free spins.
[128:35.16]Let's go.
[128:41.25]Come on.
[128:46.67]Two more free spins added.
[128:49.31]I need to level it up to bed more.
[128:50.59]Alright, well we're gonna level it up right now.
[129:03.38]Is it where our subs go?
[129:17.54]Come on.
[129:19.16]Come on, this is not enough money.
[129:22.04]Thank you.
[129:25.72]This is the shit that I pay for.
[129:27.08]No.
[129:32.16]Star Wars The Force Unleashed used it too.
[129:36.09]Yeah.
[129:38.23]It was cool.
[129:38.71]Alright, let's go.
[129:44.21]More.
[129:44.71]I need to level up my gambling ability.
[129:47.98]Steve!
[129:48.89]Steve, get in here.
[129:52.75]We're playing with house money right now.
[129:53.79]We're fine.
[129:54.11]Come on.
[130:12.07]Yes, Mr. Green.
[130:24.82]I'm not going to put any more money in, I promise.
[130:29.38]I want to level up my gambling, though.
[130:37.18]Didn't even know this part of the game existed.
[130:38.52]Neither did I. I remember they had one... They had a... Something came out before Fable 2 released.
[130:46.12]It was a game to make money to use in the game.
[130:49.10]It was like a weird casino game.
[130:54.69]Pub games.
[130:55.19]Yeah, that's right.
[131:01.89]It came out like a month or two before the game actually released.
[131:08.49]It was on Xbox Live.
[131:09.41]Like Xbox Live Arcade or something.
[131:10.70]Pub games.
[131:14.88]Alright, let's go.
[131:15.46]Alright, I'm done.
[131:16.06]I'm done.
[131:16.28]I'm done.
[131:16.48]I'm done.
[131:20.52]Imagine just walking around with a slot machine on your back.
[131:25.49]traveling slot machine guy?
[131:27.25]Alright, come on.
[131:44.79]It's staying alive.
[131:49.07]Doesn't want me to leave.
[131:49.87]Alright, let's go.
[132:01.67]Let's go.
[132:02.11]Exit.
[132:03.81]I still need 1,200 points.
[132:14.36]I... Why do people see... I... Look at my good bar.
[132:21.44]My bar... The bar is so over to the right.
[132:23.30]Look at my dog.
[132:24.08]I have a golden retriever.
[132:37.74]I thought that was a traitor.
[132:38.62]I thought this was a guy.
[132:42.09]Alright, here we go.
[132:52.75]Oh my god, I'm gonna die!
[132:55.93]What happened to me?
[132:57.98]Am I alright?
[132:58.52]Alright.
[133:17.74]That fills up so slow.
[133:18.72]I'm not even going to say anything.
[133:26.35]Whatever.
[133:46.95]I thought you used that gun.
[133:48.65]Put that gun away.
[133:54.52]Aren't we in the wilderness?
[133:56.54]We're out in the wilderness.
[133:57.58]Find something?
[134:05.40]Big spot?
[134:10.28]No?
[134:10.80]Where is it?
[134:15.62]I need to pay all the warrants?
[134:16.76]I already did.
[134:17.14]Yeah, I paid them.
[134:22.29]It was like five grand total.
[134:30.23]Oh, come on.
[134:30.69]I can make it down there.
[134:33.67]He's serious.
[134:42.46]Name the dog.
[134:42.98]I already did.
[134:44.14]Dr. Ruff, Ph.D.
[134:49.16]He's doing it again.
[134:49.70]What are you growling at?
[134:52.14]Alright, let's go save this guy.
[135:09.95]But first, what's over here?
[135:12.55]Oh, a bunch of T-posing spawnable enemies.
[135:26.22]Oh, eat shit.
[135:27.32]Die!
[135:53.27]Always nice to face a fellow killer.
[135:57.17]Everybody calls me a killer.
[136:00.07]Why is that who I am?
[136:01.13]That's not who I am.
[136:02.83]Oh, it's nice to see another killer.
[136:11.38]I'm not a killer.
[136:22.83]If killing bandits is okay, then who executes the executioner?
[136:27.02]Wait, I may have missed what you said.
[136:30.12]Executing?
[136:30.68]Who executes the executioner?
[136:39.00]Um.
[136:45.90]Okay.
[136:47.38]Are you fond of riddles?
[136:48.26]Why am I about to hear one?
[136:50.51]Three great men sit in a hall.
[136:52.65]A priest, a rich man, and a warrior.
[136:56.75]Each one bears the sellsword to kill the other two.
[137:00.95]Right?
[137:02.65]Who lives, who dies?
[137:03.63]He's of not favor of the crown, nor of the church.
[137:10.00]It depends on the sellsword.
[137:11.92]If it's sellswords we care about, then what's the real, who's the real power?
[137:16.80]His power, his knowledge, his power.
[137:20.17]And a very small man can cast a very large shadow.
[137:24.49]You know the fucking bit.
[137:25.37]That's like one of the most famous Game of Thrones monologues.
[137:42.28]I know we all hate that show, but like the first few seasons were good.
[137:54.75]Lucian's writings are fascinating.
[137:57.31]There is much in them that may interest you when you have time.
[138:00.57]For now, press on to Westcliff.
[138:04.72]Yeah, the first few seasons of Game of Thrones are some of the best television ever.
[138:08.56]Yeah, it is.
[138:09.76]Even the fourth and fifth seasons were- they're alright.
[138:13.24]The fourth season was okay.
[138:20.69]But once they got away from, like, the books, it was just like, well, whatever.
[138:26.39]I guess this shit's gonna happen.
[138:33.77]Yeah, well, you see, you see, us at HBO, see, George wrote on the back of a piece of toilet paper, uh, like, three major plot points.
[138:43.11]And that was it.
[138:43.89]And then we just kind of made up everything else.
[139:08.44]I think my main problem with Game of Thrones is that... I just don't ever want to watch it again.
[139:14.66]Like, I was so excited to get new people involved in that show.
[139:22.47]It's like, wow, you've never seen Game of Thrones?
[139:24.53]You didn't... Oh, the books.
[139:25.53]Oh, my God.
[139:26.57]We're in the middle of, like, season three right now.
[139:29.47]This is the greatest thing you will ever... This is our generations.
[139:33.63]This is our generations, Lord of the Rings.
[139:35.77]Like, this is our Tolkien.
[139:37.09]It's right here.
[139:40.32]And now I would never want to watch the whole show again.
[139:43.74]Because I know what happens halfway through.
[139:45.46]This is the Lord of the Rings for the millennial generation.
[139:58.47]This is perfect.
[140:02.90]It's what we can tell our kids about.
[140:06.90]The Lord of the Rings.
[140:14.97]I kind of thought it was going to have the same, like, cultural impact.
[140:18.53]And it did for a while.
[140:20.27]Until it didn't.
[140:20.94]Lord of the Rings is overrated?
[140:28.02]Yeah, well, you could... Alright.
[140:34.35]But the cultural impact of, like, Lord of the Rings on media and, like, fantasy media.
[140:41.83]I don't care how much you think it's overrated.
[140:53.77]It's like the same thing as Dungeons & Dragons for video games.
[140:57.33]The only reason why I'm shooting this guy with a rifle or hitting him with a sword is because a few guys decided to create Dungeons & Dragons.
[141:08.22]Wait, that was a horrible thing to do.
[141:12.67]Whatever.
[141:22.35]Like, RPGs?
[141:25.36]They only exist, like, all these things only exist because of Dungeons & Dragons.
[141:48.41]Bad boy side is coming out.
[141:49.93]Wait, what?
[141:51.87]Fable is the first RPG.
[141:53.29]I didn't say Fable is the first RPG ever.
[141:55.83]I didn't say that.
[142:05.78]Okay, I have to say this because it's funny.
[142:07.80]It's a stupid comment, but I have to say this.
[142:11.74]I'm going to give that person, this person deserves an accolade because it was funny.
[142:15.51]They said you only exist because I fucked your mom.
[142:20.66]Like, okay.
[142:21.52]Alright, dude.
[142:22.36]Fine.
[142:22.88]Like, funny.
[142:24.44]Sure.
[142:25.00]Really funny.
[142:25.68]I, like, come on.
[142:31.52]Like, that's... That's so stupid.
[142:38.99]That was a perfectly timed insult, so I'm gonna let that one slide.
[143:00.08]Kill, kill, I am.
[143:06.91]The flourishes are really fun to do though, I will say.
[143:34.16]He exists.
[143:37.53]Oh, that's so stupid.
[143:41.41]That's the kind of insult you hear on Xbox Live and you just log off because you're like, how the fuck am I going to ever respond to that and make it better?
[143:49.21]I was mid-rant about Dungeons & Dragons and RPG systems.
[143:56.62]I got shut down completely by that person.
[143:59.76]That was a total shutdown.
[144:04.35]Like absolute 100% like shut down.
[144:09.03]I cannot even give a rebuttal to that one.
[144:14.96]Always nice to face the crowd.
[144:16.78]Hold on, I gotta eat.
[144:26.02]Find some cover!
[144:27.46]Quick!
[144:41.26]I'm getting confused.
[144:42.80]I keep wanting to target her.
[144:45.32]Here we go.
[145:05.67]Don't shoot.
[145:06.99]Thank god safety's on.
[145:10.27]Can I get some of these tooltips off the screen?
[145:15.60]I think I can, right?
[145:16.94]Like, I don't want to keep seeing the fact that, like, hey, you know, that, like, you have a skill you can use.
[145:20.40]Okay, there you go.
[145:41.23]Raid song?
[145:42.05]Sing the raid song.
[145:42.73]Do we have a raid?
[145:46.60]Oh, fuck.
[146:11.70]How many points do I have?
[146:20.61]Even though the game's easy, this game is really just fun to play.
[146:25.93]It's fun just to do shoot, spell, slap.
[146:30.52]You know what I mean.
[146:36.28]Game of Thrones raid.
[146:39.43]Wait, didn't Game of Thrones tweet out, like, hey, by the way, like, we're still a franchise.
[146:56.37]Kyrian Lannister.
[146:59.79]Master Gear, thanks for the raid.
[147:01.37]Welcome, everybody.
[147:02.25]Hope you had a good stream.
[147:04.65]I'm currently playing Fable 2.
[147:07.11]It's a game only for millennials.
[147:10.89]This is a millennial game.
[147:11.91]If you're not a millennial, then you need to leave.
[147:13.75]Only 2000s kids understand this game.
[147:30.17]I wasn't trying to be funny.
[147:30.93]I actually had to go to the bathroom and where else am I going to go to the bathroom?
[147:33.63]I'm in the woods.
[147:34.63]Explain that to me.
[147:35.99]Geniuses.
[147:36.44]I'm sorry.
[147:45.58]That was like kind of rude.
[147:46.45]Kid in the 2000s or born in 2000s?

[148:52.27]Doesn't look that tough.
[149:01.21]Oh my god.
[149:04.57]He's got my hat on.
[149:05.61]Stand and fight, you cowardly knaves!
[149:09.96]Dad?
[149:11.62]Wait.
[149:12.81]Is that why I've had this mask on since I was 10?
[149:14.75]Because I'm a highwayman?
[149:17.59]I'm not like you, Dad.
[149:20.37]I'm different.
[149:22.97]I'm not evil.
[149:23.57]Oh.
[149:46.45]Hey, yeah, that guy was the guy in chat.
[149:50.87]Stick those spells up your ass.
[150:04.86]Oh, this is getting a little tricky.
[150:07.19]I think this is a high level area I shouldn't be in.
[150:16.15]Ooh, got him.
[150:42.92]That was fun.
[150:50.80]Yeah, I'm doing this.

[154:34.72]Those didn't exist.
[154:37.47]Back in medieval times, okay?
[154:38.55]We already went over that.
[154:39.19]Where's our treasure?
[154:42.91]Ooh, give me it.

[155:18.03]No, not really.
[155:18.55]I actually don't really like that much melons.
[155:28.40]Melons, the stuff that I eat around in a fruit cup.
[155:31.74]If you have pineapple, strawberries, grapes, melons, I just don't eat the melons.
[155:36.87]I eat everything else.
[155:40.76]What about watermelon?
[155:41.22]Yeah, I like watermelon.
[155:41.94]Honeydew melon, cantaloupe, steel cutlass.
[155:44.83]Better than this thing.
[156:09.15]This is 5061, no.
[156:16.49]I like watermelon.
[156:17.43]Watermelon tastes good.
[156:18.63]Although, isn't watermelon like the Captain Crunch of fruits?
[156:20.79]It's just like water and sugar.
[156:41.68]Wolverine.

[158:43.42]Good.

[159:01.93]Hmm.
[159:04.23]Wait, does it die?
[159:04.83]I can color the clothes.
[159:13.93]It's because the breadcrumbs don't tell you to go over there.
[159:18.26]That's very true.
[159:19.18]What happened?
[159:44.45]Oh, shit.
[159:45.47]It's alright.
[159:46.03]You're safe with us.
[159:46.75]They took my son.
[159:50.27]Can you show us where they took him?
[159:53.86]I think so.
[159:59.88]You going to turn into a Balvarine?
[160:08.65]I'm sure your son is alright.
[160:10.01]We'll find him.
[160:14.65]How many silver keys do I have?
[160:19.03]At least like 8 or 9, right?

[167:37.51]If a little kid ever walks over to you with, like, a stick in their hand, and they start, like, pointing at you, going like, Got you!
[167:43.84]Zapped you!
[167:46.18]If you don't pretend that you got zapped, you're a monster.
[167:56.63]Like, if you don't go like, oh, wow, you got me.
[168:00.51]If you just sit there and stare at them, like, what are you doing?

[168:40.48]Oh my god.
[168:41.54]My thing didn't work.
[168:43.02]Come on, you're supposed to let the kid win.
[168:44.76]I'm doing my force field vortex.
[168:47.44]You don't just fucking ram him.
[168:50.13]Give me a break, you monster.
[168:52.13]You are a monster.
[168:52.99]Look at you.
[169:10.35]Ah!

[169:27.28]I need to level up something.
[169:30.81]No, not yet.
[169:31.33]I'm one of those weirdos that saves everything to the very end of the mission.
[169:37.07]Children's health potion.
[169:38.37]Oh!
[169:40.44]Fruit punch!

[169:46.77]Time for our imagination snack.
[169:56.92]Healthy growing brain means healthy growing thoughts.
[170:16.49]Are there any other potions?
[170:23.40]No, I have a lot of potions.
[170:24.40]How come these are not showing up?
[170:30.06]Why does your character look like the skinny version of Fat Bastard?
[170:32.75]What the hell?
[170:44.92]I still have my companion?
[171:03.35]I would not even classify this guy as fat.
[171:05.19]I would classify him as big and strong.
[171:07.29]Although I'm not entirely sure what's going on there.
[171:14.56]I think that's the shirt.
[171:15.92]Yeah, that's the shirt.
[171:18.26]That's a puffed up, bunched up shirt.
[171:21.52]I would classify him as big and strong with a puffy shirt on.
[171:30.19]It's okay, I'm gonna move on from that Oh beer got Andy let me tell you something everybody I've ever come across that had like a big beer gut They always always could like help you do anything
[171:57.72]They can help you do anything.
[171:59.34]If you need like your house painted, they're going to help you.
[172:02.03]They're there.
[172:03.35]You need something like heavy lifted, like a piece of furniture.
[172:05.47]They're fucking there and they're going to help you.
[172:06.73]They're there for you.
[172:14.74]Like you need help with like your math homework.
[172:16.48]They are there.
[172:17.48]They will do it.
[172:17.98]They'll try.
[172:33.20]You know how many times I've seen somebody with, like, a big beer gut get up from, like, a lawn chair and be like, I'll take care of it.
[172:40.57]And they take care of it every time.
[172:45.47]They have, like, it's like magic.
[172:48.97]We made it.
[172:50.39]I don't think they'll follow us into the light.
[172:53.36]We were quite a team back there, weren't we?
[172:55.74]Those faltering buggers.
[172:57.71]Many die in their attempt to defeat the Crucible.
[173:00.66]But defeated you must if you are to have any hope of joining Lucian's army and getting to Garth.
[173:10.22]The amount of knowledge that the beer gut brings is immense.
[173:15.86]I would probably trust the guy with a big beer gut over a guy with a big white beard and a wizard hat on.
[173:22.44]I'd be like, I don't know, you're like a fucking cartoon person.
[173:24.62]Like, I want that person to help me.
[173:26.38]The one on the right.
[173:26.92]You know what I mean?
[173:27.88]Like, if there's like two doors.
[173:30.86]That's what makes it an insult, you idiot.
[173:33.44]Now shut it.
[173:36.75]They're brothers.
[173:47.14]The guy walking around with the staff that's like, come, I'll show you how to... Oh, wait, did your car just break down?
[173:53.66]Oh, I... I don't know much about axles and cars.
[174:00.81]Shit.
[174:03.35]How are we ever going to get to Mordor?
[174:05.11]I have no idea what to do.
[174:19.15]Oh, this is going to be expensive.
[174:25.85]Master Katana.
[174:28.97]These are so expensive.
[174:33.26]These are better than what I have.
[174:38.32]But long story short, I feel like that guy has a lot more knowledge and a lot more experience than Gandalf, the guy with the wizard costume on.
[174:49.74]What should I get?
[174:50.18]Ooh, it's a pistol.
[174:53.08]That's cool.
[174:57.88]I like that.
[174:58.40]I kind of want it.
[175:03.49]This is 18,000 bucks.
[175:08.53]Gandalf, the guy with the wizard costume on.
[175:12.94]I mean, kind of.
[175:24.28]You need katana for RP?
[175:26.06]No.
[175:26.38]I'm getting the pistol.
[175:27.62]Hey, I do that.
[175:28.28]I scream.
[175:28.68]You have a gift for me?
[175:30.58]What is it?
[175:31.20]Yeah.
[175:31.42]And...
[175:53.68]Why don't you fucking keep your mouth shut?
[175:58.14]Alright, hold on.
[176:02.08]I gotta be funny.
[176:03.70]Oh, these people are gonna love farting.
[176:09.19]Wait, let me speak the language.
[176:16.79]You don't like that?
[176:17.43]What?
[176:17.77]It said that they loved like comedy stuff and like humor.
[176:21.73]over and hurt yourself.
[176:23.64]Not that I don't enjoy hanging around as a holiday destination, but we should probably see about getting into the crucible.
[176:35.09]Shut up.
[176:35.49]You're just a pair of stupid tourists, ain't ya?
[176:38.97]Do you see what I'm doing right now?
[176:40.09]I'm about to shit my pants.
[176:41.21]Don't you like this?
[176:42.59]Farting isn't funny.
[176:43.85]Are we tourists, Ron?
[176:46.70]No, you're academics quite clearly.
[176:51.28]I wonder how long the Crucible's been around anyway.
[176:54.12]Okay, they like when you laugh.
[176:56.88]You'll never survive, Ren.
[176:59.98]Two weaklings like you.
[177:01.86]Yeah, two weaklings like you.
[177:05.82]I mean, I feel like I just kind of want to start fucking attacking.
[177:08.95]I heard stories about the Crucible when I was a little girl.
[177:14.91]I used to imagine what it would be like to fight in it.
[177:17.01]I never thought I'd see it for real.
[177:19.19]Oh, poor babies.
[177:21.70]I mean, there's only so many times I'm going to get insulted here.
[177:23.44]I want my present.
[177:24.46]I mean, this is the entire town.
[177:27.88]This is the whole... Okay.
[177:32.04]I mean, this is... Everybody's here.
[177:33.58]Okay.
[177:52.64]I want the present.
[177:56.68]What are the consequences if I... Hold on.
[178:01.34]Play the loot?
[178:06.99]Oh, somebody has a present.
[178:08.01]Hold on.
[178:08.49]Let me collect that.
[178:09.05]What do you got for me?
[178:14.93]Oh, you.
[178:17.41]A pretty necklace.
[178:18.17]Thanks.
[178:21.98]Tornado!
[178:22.28]Wait, what?
[178:22.62]Everybody had to... Oh my god.
[178:24.18]I guess this is strong enough.
[178:29.01]Oh my god.
[178:52.58]Alright settle down, settle down, settle down, settle down.
[178:55.28]I can leave now, right?
[178:56.26]How much points did I get?
[178:59.16]Did I just become evil?
[179:02.68]Why?
[179:02.96]They don't even give... Okay, we're good.
[179:09.58]That's not... I'm not evil.
[179:13.51]Why?
[179:13.75]What do you mean why?
[179:15.31]What?
[179:17.21]I suppose when folks die in the crucible, they can just come back as hollow men.
[179:21.05]What do you mean, why?
[179:23.51]Why?
[179:23.83]Why?
[179:25.65]Wait, I'm hurting her, too.
[179:28.11]Oh, my God.
[179:28.67]I'm sorry.
[179:29.47]How do I say sorry?
[179:30.39]How do I say sorry?
[179:31.73]Sorry.
[179:32.39]Brilliant.
[179:34.46]Where's the apologize?
[179:35.96]Where's apologize?
[179:37.24]To her.
[179:37.76]I don't want to apologize to her.
[179:41.60]Oh, great.
[179:44.62]That's nice.
[179:46.36]Oh, that's a lot of evil points.
[179:47.58]Oh.
[179:47.78]Shit!
[179:48.10]No!
[179:48.48]Just shot her in the head!
[179:51.12]Oh my god.
[179:58.89]Turn the safety on.
[180:01.09]Turn it on.
[180:13.95]Look Murray, another pair of nobodies trying to get into the crucible.
[180:18.69]Doesn't anybody know you've got to be famous to fight here?
[180:21.68]Lucian is turning this riff-raff into an army?
[180:26.04]I'd like to see how he's managing that.
[180:29.04]How are you so bad at being good?
[180:30.36]I-I-I've just... We're fine.
[180:34.69]Terribly sorry, but I'm afraid this is a rather brutal business.
[180:39.43]And it's not just the blood-spirty decapitations.
[180:42.38]People only pay to see the big names, like Willie Widowmaker or Weissgrip Sally.
[180:49.00]How about Vern Vortex?
[180:52.55]I got my hand up back here.
[180:54.91]That's what they call me now.
[180:56.19]If you don't know me, I walk downstairs.
[180:59.47]Best Crucible fighter there was back in his day.
[181:05.04]Bit redundant, isn't it?
[181:07.62]What?
[181:08.60]What do you mean?
[181:10.37]Well, why do you need the strangler part if you're already a mad dog?
[181:14.57]You're Three Stooges' hero.
[181:16.39]Well, it's intimidating, isn't it?
[181:19.15]Seems confusing to me.
[181:21.80]I mean, I get Irving the Strangler Gibbons.
[181:25.36]It toughens it up a bit, doesn't it?
[181:28.12]But it's not like Mad Dog is your given name.
[181:32.02]You know, I never thought about it before, but she's got a point.
[181:36.92]No, she doesn't.
[181:38.99]look if you really want to compete go and make a name for yourself so the crowd will actually give a flying I think I already did that's all you need a bit of luck and you'll be famous in no time no way I'm letting that friend of yours in though she can stay out here and make fun of my name all she likes an impressive 500 more renowned you have managed to alienate the very men whose favor we need only one of them
[182:06.80]Hero, you must find a way to impress those men, and you must do it alone.
[182:11.78]There are still many people in the world whom you could help, but you're harmed.
[182:15.42]Whether it's good or evil, your reputation will be made.
[182:22.72]Who is that?
[182:23.96]Who is that?
[182:24.50]Did you see that?
[182:25.64]You see what I just did over there?
[182:26.87]Do you have any idea what... Is that good enough fame for you?
[182:31.73]Nobody fucks with me, alright?
[182:37.80]I don't understand what was that.
[182:40.98]What was that for?
[182:41.80]I can't hold it.
[182:47.40]It's time to take a piss break.
[182:48.52]I'll be back.
[182:50.28]Stop killing.
[182:51.62]Okay.
[182:52.62]I just got attacked from behind.
[182:55.74]What am I going to do?
[182:56.38]Not defend myself?
[183:00.96]Oh, okay.
[183:01.56]I'll be right back.
[183:03.33]Give me a sec.
[186:19.43]Hello.
[186:20.01]I'm here.
[186:24.15]I'm just laughing.
[186:25.10]Just laughing.
[186:27.76]He was sitting here laughing the whole time?
[186:29.00]No, I actually went pee and I got a water.
[186:35.78]Ugh, okay.
[186:36.90]Let's go back.
[186:41.24]So, I need to look at this.
[186:44.67]See what I've done.
[186:48.28]Okay, well, I'll just go donate 10 grand to the church again.
[186:51.88]The demon.
[186:59.50]Oh, my dog's still a golden retriever.
[187:00.80]I'm good.
[187:03.70]Is a sale going on?
[187:06.20]Oh, new job.
[187:06.88]Bounty hunter.
[187:15.41]Okay.
[187:16.93]What quests?
[187:18.13]Earn 500 more renown to gain entrance to the Crucible.
[187:22.79]Find and rescue slaves.
[187:25.43]The Temple of Shadows.
[187:29.86]Barnum is looking for a business partner to earn his 5,000 gold in his new scheme.
[187:35.28]That sounds... I'll do that.
[187:38.44]Ripper and his bandits have been terrorizing a farming family.
[187:43.10]The Temple of Light is under threat of attack from its worst enemies, the Shadow Worshippers.
[187:49.24]Red Harvest, help Ripper's bandit crew expand its operations.
[187:56.51]I'm going to do Defender of the Light.
[188:08.91]Do the shooting range and get the best gun.
[188:15.06]Way back.
[188:15.40]Let me just get some renown.
[188:18.53]There he is.
[188:19.11]The Lightbringer.
[188:19.93]Uh, yeah.
[188:27.21]I don't have free aim yet.
[188:35.46]Okay.
[188:36.94]Let's go here.
[188:37.72]Defend the temple so I can get some more points on the good side.
[188:50.03]What do you need?
[188:50.75]Hmm.
[188:50.91]Where are they?
[188:51.95]Huh.
[189:19.56]Perhaps even the end of the village and all its people.
[189:23.56]You helped us once before.
[189:25.77]Will you do so again?
[189:27.13]I will.
[189:28.61]As long as you give me... I can put you down as a reference for me being a good person.
[189:33.87]Thank you.
[189:35.71]The first thing you must do is to check the statues from which the water pours forth.
[189:41.14]Ensure they haven't been contaminated with the taint of evil.
[189:45.56]The shadow worshippers are likely to target the main chamber next, but you mustn't allow them to desecrate it.
[189:53.43]Okay.
[189:57.95]Let's go kill some shadow worshippers.
[190:07.89]I really should level up the gun stuff.
[190:10.66]I think the guns are more fun than magic, but it's kind of too late.
[190:15.92]Not really though.
[190:16.74]Alright, hold on.
[190:17.90]Will.
[190:19.32]Shock 3.
[190:20.66]Which would be pretty good.
[190:22.34]Blades 4.
[190:22.84]64,800.
[190:22.86]That's 3, 4, 5.
[190:23.88]That's close.
[190:24.58]Vortex 4.
[190:24.84]Hmm.
[190:25.00]Hmm.
[190:47.27]Time control might be kind of cool.
[190:52.31]I use shock all the time.
[190:54.35]I feel like that's so cool.
[191:03.33]Vortex 4.
[191:03.87]Let's do it.
[191:13.05]Sell the skills back with Y. I'll just sell chaos back.
[191:17.90]I'm not going to use it.
[191:26.64]Alright.
[191:27.12]There's also raised dead, which would be kind of cool.
[191:29.77]Alright.
[191:35.65]Accuracy.
[191:36.19]36,000.
[191:36.35]Oh, here we go.
[191:38.63]Ranged aim.
[191:39.21]I can now do it now.
[191:39.85]Hold Y to enter aim mode.
[191:45.70]Click left or right while you're locked on an enemy to instantly switch to other targets.
[191:49.04]Okay.
[191:52.36]Speed.
[191:52.70]Might as well just get it.
[191:53.38]Let's see.
[192:02.82]Do I have to hold it the whole time?
[192:05.36]Oh, I have to hold it the whole time.
[192:06.62]If I want to stay in there.
[192:12.79]That's kind of cool.
[192:14.11]I can now headshot people.
[192:16.04]Oh, dear.
[192:17.44]Do the shooting contest.
[192:19.22]Alright.
[192:19.98]Hold on.
[192:20.40]Let me do this part first.
[192:21.12]We got Vortex IV.
[192:31.14]Oh, this takes... This takes some bomb.
[192:34.35]Alright.
[192:36.27]If I'm going to do Vortex IV, then that means...
[192:41.69]I'll do Blades 3, Vortex 4, and then Shock 1 and Shock 2.
[192:46.82]That sounds good to me.
[192:53.56]Does the game have bubsy 3D tank controls?
[192:56.12]No.
[192:57.98]It's a little floaty, but I wouldn't say it's that ridiculous.
[193:00.72]Okay.
[193:19.25]Bubsy isn't floaty.
[193:22.98]Well, I mean, I didn't say Bubsy was floaty.
[193:24.72]I said this was floaty.
[193:30.94]Oh my god.
[193:31.74]Walk over it.
[193:32.42]What's wrong with you?
[193:43.63]Is this as good as Kingdom Hearts 2?
[193:47.78]Um, I say this is like Kingdom Hearts 2 without like the 600 hours of cutscenes.
[193:53.32]And no goofy Donald and Mickey.
[194:11.65]Nothing like Kingdom Hearts 2.
[194:12.93]Yeah, absolutely nothing like it.
[194:15.95]Uh, there's a melee ability and you have spells.
[194:19.13]That's where the differences are.
[194:20.43]The similarities end.
[194:21.37]Similarity.
[194:21.81]What's a book?
[194:24.12]Similarian?
[194:24.54]Similarian?
[194:24.80]The Simoleon is the Sim currency.
[194:26.04]The Similarian.
[194:41.66]Cimmerillion is the Lord of the Rings thing.
[194:43.56]Lord of the Rings, like, prequel.
[194:57.79]Cimmerillion.
[194:58.67]Yeah, whatever.
[195:08.28]Don't poison the well!
[195:19.38]Boom.
[195:21.10]Say goodbye to this one.
[195:22.50]Boom.
[195:38.37]Where is he?
[195:43.75]He's LARPing again.
[195:44.87]Yep.
[195:46.97]Come on, it's fun to LARP.
[196:02.51]I think it's actually pronounced Toy Boat.
[196:05.71]Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat, Toy Boat.
[196:11.84]In fury vos ta set on.
[196:34.40]It does hurt.
[196:35.04]Who died?
[196:36.34]Me?
[196:37.50]Oh, I died.
[196:45.97]Eternal orgy?
[196:47.21]That guy just wanted an eternal orgy.
[196:55.38]I'm here for the eternal orgy.
[196:57.24]I don't care about anything else.
[197:04.33]Please doy doy doy.
[197:06.21]Oh, there you go.
[197:11.13]My voice is a little hoarse today.
[197:12.31]I can't do it.
[197:24.72]Oh, he's got swords.
[197:33.25]Why can I... I don't want to auto-aim.
[197:37.06]I really couldn't harm him.
[198:13.75]Cornelius Grimm
[198:47.01]How about my power?
[198:48.05]It didn't even ask me about my power level.
[198:56.27]It's way higher than yours.
[198:57.51]It always is in all these shows.
[199:19.75]Power!
[199:24.41]I beat him.
[199:27.93]So glad I have vortex 4.
[199:30.43]It's just, I'm unstoppable.
[199:32.47]Nobody can even touch me.
[199:44.66]Nobody can do anything.
[199:45.66]I'm unstoppable.
[199:54.83]Alright, I'll be back for you later.

[202:00.44]Do something funny.
[202:01.32]Tell the do something funny story or sing the doing something funny song.
[202:04.94]I like that comment.
[202:08.75]Okay, where's the shooting gallery?
[202:14.31]Oh.
[202:15.67]Fortune's Tower.
[202:16.59]Sure.
[202:26.21]I actually forget how this one's played.
[202:34.07]Pressing your luck played with a unique deck of cards.
[202:36.03]A deck contains mostly number cards ranked from 1 through 7 plus 4 hero cards.
[202:45.55]This deck contains 8 of each card ranked 1 through 7.
[202:50.35]Other decks may contain 9 or even 10 sets.
[202:53.55]Okay.
[202:53.69]Okay.
[202:55.08]Place a bet to start the game.
[202:56.24]Your bet must be 15 gold or some multiple of 15.
[202:58.18]Sure.
[203:04.00]The dealer starts by dealing three cards.
[203:06.18]The first card is face down and it's called the gate card.
[203:09.06]The next two cards are face up and create the second row.
[203:12.01]There can be as many as eight rows if you play all the way to the bottom of the tower.
[203:15.45]Alright.
[203:20.97]This is the starting deal.
[203:23.80]On each row, you have a choice.
[203:25.04]You may take the dealer's offer or deal another row.
[203:28.44]The dealer's offer is equal to the total value of cards in the row.
[203:30.94]On this row, the offer is 9.
[203:32.16]Remember, you bet 15.
[203:34.84]You cash out now for 9 gold to push on and hope for a higher value.
[203:37.81]Push on.
[203:38.37]Alright.
[203:41.19]Row 3 would be worth 18, but wait!
[203:42.93]You've also caught a vertical pair.
[203:44.41]Pairs such as this will often end the game, but not always.
[203:49.24]Alright.
[203:49.83]Same rank on the previous row.
[203:51.51]Pair will cause misfortune ending the game with a value of zero.
[203:54.77]Okay.
[203:59.32]Okay.
[203:59.72]Pairs are worth zero gold, but they keep you safe from pairs.
[204:03.24]Okay.
[204:03.74]Alright.
[204:08.41]Ah, this is stupid.
[204:09.85]I don't know.
[204:10.21]Just whatever.
[204:10.89]I'll just go.
[204:22.15]When an entire row matches, you get more money.
[204:24.13]Alright, let's go.
[204:25.13]I get it.
[204:25.83]I don't care.
[204:33.72]I want a jackpot.

[208:02.71]5,000 gold for your new scheme.
[208:04.87]How much money do I have?
[208:20.43]As a matter of irrefutation, I can think of no one better to become my new business partner.

[208:32.73]You already have my attention.
[208:33.87]Just take it.
[208:35.55]That's the temple of business and yodeling, of course.
[208:38.49]I don't have enough money?
[208:44.01]Oh, dear.
[208:45.21]I really don't have enough money.
[208:47.54]Perhaps you can return when you have it all.
[208:51.19]Alright, I need that shooting gallery.
[208:52.91]Somebody said I can get a gun.
[209:00.50]Where can I do it?
[209:00.98]Is it a job?
[209:02.42]Go back to the crossroads and take a right.
[209:10.73]Go back here.
[209:22.21]Student gallery?
[209:22.81]No!
[209:27.33]It's right outside the town.
[209:33.79]Out here.
[209:34.09]I think this is it.
[209:38.79]I think it's it.
[209:40.19]Alright, what's with this purple nonsense?
[209:48.42]Come on.
[209:50.63]Bewitching augment?

[210:51.08]Okay, that was a bandit.
[211:03.95]How can I tell who the bandit is?
[211:07.20]This is really awkward.
[211:13.15]This is horrible to aim.
[211:28.31]Literally 14 points.
[211:29.01]How am I supposed to get 175 points?
[211:30.25]Oh, there's a round two.
[211:36.19]Okay.
[211:36.29]Okay.
[212:05.95]I can't even tell This is very hard to do, I hate it
[212:35.71]Yeah, it is rubbish.
[212:39.74]I feel like somebody's holding their hands around my neck.
[212:43.00]And strangling me while I do this.
[212:44.30]What'd I get?
[213:01.24]Dirty?
[213:03.67]This is the last round.
[213:04.81]How am I ever going to do this?
[213:13.06]Oh, come on.
[213:35.64]It's all about round 3.

[215:44.93]Come on!
[215:52.01]Alright, that was a good run.
[215:53.05]That was a good run.
[215:56.27]That was like 50 or 60 points, right?
[216:14.66]Cracking toast from it.

[218:51.87]Quiet.
[218:52.11]Everybody quiet.
[218:52.81]Nobody talk. ...
[219:16.12]It's a cardboard message.
[219:46.22]Fuck.
[219:53.64]Okay.
[219:54.02]6, 12.
[219:54.40]I need 60 points.
[219:59.50]This is the worst one.
[220:20.08]God damn it, the aim is so fucking horrible!
[220:53.35]Oh, the fact that you have to hold triangle is like fucking gouge my eyes out.
[220:57.11]It's so horrible.
[220:58.57]Why would you ever have an aim system like this?
[221:11.94]I, like, holding Y down is like, what an awful fucking system that is.
[221:20.04]Why don't I just hold down right trigger?
[221:21.62]Or like left trigger or something.
[221:22.60]Like every other fucking video game ever made.
[221:23.99]Hold.
[221:33.97]I'm holding it down.
[221:34.87]What the fuck?
[221:42.97]I would rather go to the dentist and get my teeth ripped out than do this one more time.
[221:46.56]This is horrible.
[222:03.65]I'm holding triangle.
[222:04.83]I'm it's literally I what why is it doing that?
[222:10.57]Oh my god, I'm so mad right now.
[222:13.35]And you know why that's 175 points?
[222:14.83]Because of shit you have to... Oh, I hate this.
[222:18.61]What a terrible fucking system.
[222:22.19]Analog aiming already sucks, asshole.
[222:24.48]Why would you ever make it like this?
[222:28.58]Holy shit.
[222:29.64]Go back 12 years ago and delete this fucking whole part of the game.
[222:32.78]And redo the entire aiming.
[222:35.56]Holding Y to aim and then the left stick?
[222:38.81]Get the fuck out of here.
[222:41.56]What a terrible fucking system.
[222:47.23]I'm losing points for shooting old ladies?
[222:48.95]What?
[222:52.75]Do it again.
[222:57.03]Tantrum.
[223:02.49]It sucks though.
[223:04.19]Who plays this and goes, yeah, that works.
[223:08.33]It's like eight frames a second.
[223:09.90]That works.
[223:19.49]You're one hell of a shot.
[223:46.15]Oh my god, why are you doing?
[223:47.95]I'm holding, why?
[223:49.39]What the fuck?
[223:51.87]Why does it zoom out?
[223:53.21]I have not taken my finger off the thing the entire time.
[223:56.47]Ayayay.
[224:17.59]He's malding.
[224:20.32]Yeah, I am.
[224:20.96]Dude, if I was ever in a fucking board room and somebody said they want to put analog aiming in a game, I would throw the fucking desk out the window and be like, don't do it.
[224:33.53]Don't, please, God, don't do it, please.
[224:56.13]I want to exit and shoot this guy in the head.
[224:57.37]Safety off.
[225:21.22]How do I leave the game?
[225:27.70]Well, bully for you.
[225:29.62]You've made it to the final... I can't leave.
[225:33.42]It's not about... I know where they come up.
[225:42.88]The problem is like... Like...
[225:53.26]Oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops.
[225:55.02]There it is.
[226:00.94]I want to just leave this fucking minigame.
[226:12.84]Oh.
[226:32.72]Great.
[226:37.81]Alright, I'm fucking out of here.
[226:39.93]Fuck you, Capcom.
[226:43.19]Right then, let's see what you've won.
[226:54.58]Dunno if this will make you forget what a middling shot you are.
[227:10.43]Get the fuck out of here.
[227:11.90]Oh my god, game.
[227:22.61]I know you're not going to hit me.
[227:24.17]You won't hit me.
[227:25.23]Why is it just locked?
[227:26.05]I don't want to lock onto him.
[227:40.00]Whatever.
[227:47.77]That part sucks.
[227:58.52]Kill.
[227:58.86]You know you want to.
[228:12.44]I thought I had it too.
[228:14.46]Doesn't matter.
[228:15.10]I don't care about the super secret gun.
[228:23.73]I do want potions though.
[228:30.75]I think I have potions.
[228:31.57]Do I?
[228:33.01]It is a crucible contender if ever I saw one I've been causing quite a commotion ain't ya?
[228:41.05]I sucks what?
[228:43.31]Why there hasn't been so much buzz about a competitor since knockout Nora remember her mad dog?
[228:52.69]Nice good person horns I kinda just look like a pig
[229:02.23]Those are pig ears, guys.
[229:03.43]Those are not horns.
[229:05.07]Make sure you're properly kitted out before you go in.
[229:08.79]The crowd gets ever so upset when our fighters die too quickly.
[229:13.80]But if you live, you become a legend and you'll be a shoo-in to join Lucian's army.
[229:18.98]I don't think any winners have turned that opportunity down yet.
[229:21.72]Private sector security work is very lucrative, I hear.
[229:27.62]Right.
[229:28.12]No dogs allowed inside.
[229:30.10]Health and safety, you understand.
[229:36.22]let's do it use fast aim style onto target and slow move towards head wait what fast aim style
[230:01.89]I'm not doing that again.
[230:03.79]That was literally like pulling teeth out of my ass.
[230:06.63]I'm not doing that again.
[230:17.35]Master Katana.
[230:25.68]What about clothes?
[230:32.75]Ooh, I kind of like these.
[230:33.45]Ooh, I kind of like these.
[230:36.81]This is like a doctor.
[230:38.03]Did I put on like the doctor outfit?
[230:41.79]Like the surgeon garb?
[230:42.63]I match now.
[231:05.39]Upper body.
[231:05.85]There we go.
[231:09.09]I like that.
[231:29.20]These.
[231:38.56]Okay, whatever.
[231:39.10]Alright, I'm ready.
[231:40.40]Me.
[231:40.70]If you cosplayed as this, you would get kicked out of the convention.
[231:52.61]I probably would.
[232:02.52]I would certainly embrace this opportunity, but I'm still waiting for my lucky robes to come back from the cleaners.
[232:10.38]Well, I can't possibly go on next.
[232:12.62]My crossbow's got an awful cold.
[232:17.26]Do not look at Gorgoron.
[232:19.55]Gorgoron has an ingrowing toenail right now.
[232:21.91]An evil toenail.
[232:23.65]Is that the girl?
[232:25.33]Is that the little girl?
[232:26.83]You, the new guy.
[232:28.41]It's your lucky day.
[232:30.11]Get your ass in there.
[232:32.49]You might want to read up on the rules.
[232:35.69]Not like most contenders can read.
[232:39.49]The last mage to stand victorious in this bloody, thirsty theater was Nelson or the palmist.
[232:44.09]Ooh, the things that woman could do with a pack of flowers.
[232:46.75]Alright, let's go kick some ass.
[232:52.61]Eight rounds of pain, death, and fun.
[232:54.63]Beat around target time to earn a perfect score.
[232:56.87]Five perfect scores to get you a top prize.
[233:00.13]Let's go.
[233:03.25]Let's hear it for Salad Dodger.
[233:08.32]Look at me.
[233:09.22]Round one, three, two, one, go.
[233:15.58]First wave.
[233:17.59]Bugs.
[233:18.19]I was simple.
[233:32.72]Let's go!
[233:33.36]Well, they won't be drawing down any gifts to help him out!
[233:38.07]Second wave!
[233:40.31]Wait for them to spawn and then just drop it.
[233:44.33]One, two, three, go!
[233:46.17]Alright, that's the strategy, go!
[233:49.07]Three, two, one, go!
[233:50.13]Spectacular!
[233:50.95]Yeah!
[234:11.80]Kill it!
[234:17.88]Last wave?
[234:18.26]Oh shit, he's alive.
[234:22.03]Oh, I got a perfect round.
[234:30.73]Nice.
[234:32.99]The bugs don't even do anything?
[234:34.87]Magic is the worst way to play the game.
[234:37.76]Well, that's what everybody voted for.
[234:45.18]Oh my God.
[234:45.76]Okay.
[234:56.04]I'm just going to keep doing that.
[235:00.10]I'll be a boring Andy right now.
[235:01.96]It doesn't matter.
[235:18.23]Oh my god, this is so much easier.
[235:22.62]I can't even see what's happening, but I think I'm winning.
[235:33.34]Do I heal?
[235:41.12]Kill this guy!
[235:41.86]Oh my god!
[235:45.52]Shit, I don't have any health.
[235:50.73]2,000 gold?
[235:54.70]Holy shit.
[235:57.52]I have to eat something.
[236:03.72]Why is that health potion not on the bar?
[236:10.37]I don't think I'm going to make it to the end.
[236:11.51]Am I strong enough to get to the end?
[236:18.86]Oh shit!
[236:20.04]Kill!
[236:47.01]What do you mean?
[236:47.55]Are we doing second wave?
[236:59.95]Where's the next wave?
[237:02.76]Oh, shit.
[237:03.22]Run.
[237:06.38]Just get the money.
[237:06.94]Who cares?

[237:16.44]You spawned him in a weird place.
[237:20.18]Ow!
[237:23.44]Oh, fuck!
[237:28.45]It's not boring!
[237:29.21]Look what I'm doing!
[238:06.26]Do them with your gun?
[238:07.30]I did.
[238:09.50]Just five more rounds?
[238:15.04]Oh my god.
[238:15.92]I'm not going to be able to do this.
[238:17.58]It's getting progressively harder.
[238:18.66]How am I going to do this?
[238:34.59]You think I can do it?
[238:35.33]I don't think I can.
[238:45.98]Spend your points.
[238:47.63]What can I do?
[238:48.13]Toughness?
[238:50.57]Yeah.

[238:57.31]Alright.
[238:57.47]I want Vortex 4.
[239:14.96]Blades three, no shock three.
[239:18.88]Blades to shock one.
[239:25.50]What will it be this time?
[239:27.06]Oh, I can buy stuff.
[239:28.59]Java potion.
[239:29.47]Oh yeah.

[239:38.29]You'll love it.
[239:39.69]Beautiful weapons.
[239:40.37]I can't even buy anything.
[239:43.60]When's the guy going to make funny noises?
[239:45.20]Yeah, I just had like a meltdown about like the aim down sights.
[239:50.16]Come on, that was the meltdown.
[239:52.84]Yeah, that's what everybody's here for.
[239:55.26]You got to see it.
[239:58.76]More.
[240:00.19]More.
[240:03.21]Meltdown is funny.
[240:04.93]No, stop it.
[240:11.70]I did not want to see that.
[240:21.19]Anger is funny.
[240:23.74]I don't even get angry, I get irritated.
[240:47.11]Oh, shit.
[240:47.75]Excitement times five.
[240:55.88]Look at this.
[240:59.26]Come on, queue it up, queue it up, queue it up.
[241:14.33]Ugh.
[241:17.38]Give it up.
[241:23.05]Oh, being a will user is so awesome here.
[241:27.05]Am I going to die?
[241:27.59]I think I'm okay.
[241:31.89]One.
[241:44.26]Just keep spamming this.
[241:46.02]Leveling up Vortex was such a good idea.
[241:49.02]What an amazing idea this was.
[241:50.38]Oh, God.
[242:07.60]Oh, God, that hurt.
[242:17.79]oh god run away mediocre well I'm look what I'm doing man give me a perfect round come on 30 seconds
[242:48.14]I need, I need vortex 5.
[242:50.88]How much is vortex 5?
[242:51.80]172,000.
[242:55.71]Oh shit, I'm kind of close.
[243:02.65]Using sword?
[243:03.55]What?
[243:03.91]I'm a magic user.
[243:08.17]I have all my points in magic.
[243:09.73]Of course I'm going to use magic.
[243:15.31]Why would I not use magic?
[243:25.24]I think I have experience potions.
[243:32.18]Concentrated will.
[243:39.70]Confused will.
[243:42.75]I'm at 100,000.
[243:43.41]Alright, I think I'll get it after this.
[243:47.45]I cut my finger.
[243:48.07]Please give it a kiss.
[243:51.74]Alright.
[243:52.58]Oh, this is going to be bad.
[243:54.92]I'm not... This is where it ends.
[243:56.84]I can't... Wait.
[243:57.64]What if I go down the middle?
[243:58.36]I can't cheat here.
[244:03.56]I'm not getting perfect around here in no way.
[244:06.32]What is the game doing?
[244:28.73]I might still be able to do it.
[244:37.96]Who's next?
[244:40.02]Why am I facing this way?
[244:40.96]Pick that up!
[244:43.66]Oh my god, what are you doing?
[244:44.82]What did I fall down from?
[245:10.19]I wish I could pick this up.
[245:15.95]Exciting.
[245:17.71]Let me just do the crucible.
[245:27.18]See if I can catch everybody.
[245:36.98]He's just barely out of reach.
[245:41.82]I would love to shoot the barrel.
[245:43.22]Oh my god.
[245:44.96]God damn it.
[245:45.98]I can't target the barrel.
[245:53.24]I don't want to target this thing.
[245:57.55]Oh my god.
[245:58.57]Damn it.
[245:59.63]Somebody said aim.
[246:05.27]Do you?
[246:23.33]Aim just latches onto everybody.
[246:24.81]No perfect round.
[246:30.83]Great.
[246:35.92]I'm kind of glad the Forza developers are taking it over.
[246:38.00]I'll be honest.
[246:39.00]3, 2, 1.
[247:08.51]Damn it.
[247:14.76]I think I have enough for... Do I have enough?
[247:20.44]He's blaming the devs for his mediocrity.
[247:24.14]No, I'm... I'm just saying, I feel like they give them a chance.
[247:28.76]Give the Forza devs a chance.
[247:30.08]I feel like they're going to do something really cool.
[247:47.93]Blaming the devs for his mediocrity.
[247:51.06]Oh, you don't want to just hit hold B and watch the screen explode?
[248:10.81]Come on, bring it on.
[248:16.32]Where are they?
[248:19.98]Oh shit.
[248:24.18]OK, run, run, run, run away, run away.
[248:42.38]Wait till I get Vortex V, you're all gonna be so mad.
[248:45.66]I'm gonna be mad because it's gonna be so stupid.
[248:47.30]I thought that was me.
[248:58.06]Mediocre!
[249:14.83]Here we go.
[249:15.59]Level 5 Vortex.
[249:16.33]Are you ready?
[249:16.91]This is game over.
[249:45.83]I'll do it after.
[249:46.33]I'm not in a good position to do it.
[249:55.50]Kill him!
[250:14.86]2,000 gold.
[250:15.38]That's a lot.
[250:15.90]I need a heal.
[250:16.98]Step on the shiny square.
[250:19.94]Hold on.
[250:28.91]Fucking stalagmite.

[251:08.45]Oh, this is turning into one
[251:15.03]Alright.

[251:17.03]Alright.
[251:17.55]Now I'll be able to do Vortex 5.
[251:20.15]It's time to see what it does.
[251:21.01]How much CBD have you had today?
[251:24.75]Wouldn't you like to know?
[251:26.71]None.
[251:36.02]Is he more obese than he was yesterday?
[251:37.58]I don't think so.
[251:41.14]What will it be this time?
[251:42.90]You'll love it.
[251:44.28]Sensible.
[251:45.46]Have a nice day.
[251:47.10]You'll love it.
[251:49.02]Sensible, boss.
[251:50.67]You'll love it.

[255:07.32]Alright, roommate.
[255:11.73]Who cares?
[255:13.33]He walked into the strong winds, yeah.

[257:09.66]He's so close.
[257:12.83]Why can I not dodge roll?
[257:13.83]It's supposed to be tap A to dodge roll.
[257:44.94]What is this camera angle?
[257:57.17]Just fucking die already.
[257:58.71]Oh my god.
[258:17.25]I did it.
[258:17.65]Alright, I won.

[258:51.74]That's it.
[259:02.83]Yeah, somebody just said it.
[259:03.59]In that amount of time, I could have just made like $200,000 serving drinks.
[259:18.35]Go give the guy 5,000?
[259:18.79]Oh yeah, that's right.
[259:19.79]Oh, congratulations!
[259:29.85]Three cheers for the new Crucible champion!
[259:34.84]Vortex all of your fans.
[259:40.44]Your victory in the Crucible has earned you the right to be called Lionheart.
[259:44.28]This title is now free.
[259:48.36]Oh, wait.
[259:49.20]I didn't mean to.
[259:50.18]Okay.
[260:18.04]You might want to visit your family.
[260:20.64]Say goodbye.
[260:22.52]You know.
[260:24.48]Anyway, I'll make my way to the docks.
[260:28.17]So you know where to find me when you're all set to go?
[260:30.27]I do.
[260:30.79]I'm ready to go.
[260:32.83]Wait, you have a gift.
[260:33.59]What is it?
[260:36.20]I'm gonna give that guy the money, yeah.
[260:37.70]Hammer has a good point.
[260:39.22]Once you are in the spire, leaving will be difficult.
[260:44.66]And there are those who still need your help on these shores.
[260:47.44]If you abandon them now, they will surely come to harm.
[260:51.08]I'm not going to do that.
[260:52.98]Do not get on that ship until you are truly ready to leave your guests behind.
[260:57.85]Guard isn't going anywhere.
[260:59.71]How could I not walk on this?
[261:03.79]Oh my goodness.
[261:06.07]What the hell?
[261:11.76]So frustrated.
[261:15.20]He's up here.
[261:17.80]Forza.
[261:21.94]Where is he?
[261:22.34]I thought he was up here.
[261:25.59]Fuck you Capcom.
[261:27.03]Am I ever going to be able to live that down?
[261:29.81]Am I ever going to be able to get over that one?
[261:38.47]You don't think so?
[261:45.07]No.
[261:54.90]You did it so early.
[261:56.24]I know.
[262:02.98]It was within like 10 minutes of starting.
[262:04.92]Nothing to do with the game either.
[262:06.02]Alright, here's your 5 grand.
[262:19.14]Make a game industry commentary channel.
[262:22.50]I have a feeling all my videos would get like 50,000 dislikes.
[262:50.65]Okay, now... They said to... Uh, you might not be able to come back, so... Bartender.
[262:59.32]Okay, I'm gonna do... What should I do?
[263:07.64]What about waver for quests?
[263:09.65]Aspire.
[263:13.83]The freezing.
[263:16.39]Summoners.
[263:19.09]Donating to the light.
[263:22.79]Finish the shooting range.
[263:23.83]I can't.
[263:30.47]Did you just kick my dog?
[263:33.94]This guy just kicked the dog.
[263:38.04]I just killed somebody.
[263:39.80]I just shot somebody.
[263:41.86]I was trying to shoot you.
[263:43.02]Who did I kill over here?
[263:46.68]God damn it.
[263:47.60]I shot this guy.
[263:48.20]Fuck.
[263:54.62]Oh, go- Wait, wait, wait.
[263:57.22]Wait, wait, wait.
[263:57.84]I don't want to kill you.
[263:58.92]I don't want to kill you.
[263:59.46]I want to play the game.
[264:00.90]Can I play the slot machine?
[264:02.06]Don't.
[264:03.32]Please, don't.
[264:04.12]Don't.
[264:04.40]I didn't- I don't want to kill him.
[264:10.69]I killed him.
[264:11.17]Alright, I killed him.
[264:12.05]I gotta leave.
[264:12.81]I gotta get out now.
[264:15.19]No, that's- I need- That's a guy I can play gambling games with and I'm never coming back.
[264:22.17]Shoot that guy.
[264:23.79]I'm sorry.
[264:24.49]I don't even know who did it.
[264:25.27]It wasn't even me.
[264:30.09]Alright, go to the shooting range.
[264:31.25]Fuck it.
[264:44.65]No, I can't vortex them all.
[264:46.09]I'm going to have to pay like $30,000.
[264:57.28]Alright.
[264:58.46]Come on.
[264:58.72]This is it.
[264:59.34]Let's go.
[265:00.36]Let's go.
[265:00.68]Alright.
[265:19.13]Alright.
[266:15.05]alright that was good that was a good round that was a good round good round good round good round
[267:04.51]Why?
[267:04.99]What the fuck?
[267:14.61]Why is it zooming me out?
[267:16.26]That's so fucking infuriating.
[267:18.06]I'm not doing that.
[267:25.12]All these are missing.
[267:25.98]Holy shit.
[267:27.88]I can't fucking believe how bad that is.
[267:32.03]I'm holding Y the whole time.
[267:33.82]Why would it pull me out?
[267:34.84]And it's just like, oh, you're out.
[267:46.45]The rain is making this fucking harder to aim.
[267:50.11]It's dropping my framerate to like 18.
[267:56.29]I... What are you doing?
[267:59.04]What is it doing that for?
[268:00.48]Why is it doing that?
[268:02.86]I don't understand why is it doing that?
[268:04.23]I'm just holding Y. It's over.
[268:16.31]I want to turn my facecam on and be like, what in the name of fucking God?
[268:19.50]I'm holding Y right now.
[268:21.66]It doesn't make any sense.
[268:29.34]It's just, it's as if I'm not touching Y. I don't know why it's doing that.
[268:39.34]This would have been pretty close, too.
[268:44.18]Has the controller busted?
[268:45.31]No, it's called caring about fucking rain and dropping your FPS of the whole game by 20.
[268:51.23]That was going to be so close, too.
[268:55.73]Ugh.
[268:59.31]Use a mouse?
[268:59.85]This game's not on PC.
[269:07.55]I'm going to hold Y right now.
[269:12.58]Because I don't understand why it's doing this.
[269:16.76]Okay, I'm going to hold Y. I'm holding Y right now.
[269:20.04]I'm not going to let it go.
[269:31.01]Why is it stopping that?
[269:39.04]That doesn't make any sense.
[269:43.37]I wish I had an explanation for you.
[270:01.19]Can you toggle it?
[270:03.13]No, this is one of those... It's one of those games that just has... Every button has like four different contexts of when to press it and when to hold it.
[270:11.77]Like Y is shoot, hold Y is aim.
[270:15.07]You remember when every fucking goddamn game was doing this?
[270:17.30]Like contextual gameplay mechanic presses.
[270:19.60]Oh, I hated it.
[270:22.38]I still do.
[270:27.36]Stages of grief.
[270:28.58]Yes!
[270:33.01]Oh my God.
[271:14.28]I hit him in the head here.
[271:15.48]Okay.
[271:38.19]Alright, that was bad.
[271:38.81]That wasn't bad.
[271:43.39]That wasn't bad.
[271:43.85]I have an idea.
[271:58.16]Oh, it's a bad idea.
[271:59.98]Never mind.
[272:06.56]It did it again.
[272:37.35]Alright, this is it.
[272:38.17]I got it.
[272:38.52]I got it.
[272:38.84]I got it.
[272:39.24]I need to get like 60.
[272:40.08]Come on.
[272:41.38]Wait, what?
[272:42.48]Why did it pull me out?
[272:43.52]It pulled me out.
[272:44.24]I thought it was over.
[272:45.88]What the fuck?
[272:47.16]I couldn't even aim the gun.
[272:49.10]I couldn't aim the gun.
[272:50.22]I thought it was over.
[272:51.04]I couldn't.
[272:53.04]I was pressing.
[272:53.94]What?
[272:59.76]Why does it keep doing that?
[273:01.92]I can still do it.
[273:12.07]Oh my god.
[273:13.45]Why?
[273:14.17]What are you doing?
[273:15.81]Why is it doing that?
[273:18.24]I don't understand.
[273:21.84]I am holding Y right now.
[273:24.00]I'm pressing it as hard as I fucking can.
[273:26.18]I just let it go.
[273:26.94]I'm pressing it again.
[273:28.14]Oh my god.
[273:29.24]Why?
[273:29.58]How could this?
[273:30.54]How is it possible?
[273:33.12]I didn't let it go.
[273:47.93]I probably would have had it too.
[273:50.15]Oh my god, it's so fucking- it's killing me.
[273:55.98]I- Oh my god, what the fuck is happening?
[274:02.14]It's like it's not even registering the fucking controller.
[274:05.43]What's happening?
[274:10.63]Right then, let's see what you've won.
[274:14.01]Now this could come in handy, I'm sure.
[274:19.53]I'm pressing it too hard?
[274:20.63]I'm not pressing it.
[274:23.64]It's just a slug piece of shit.
[274:28.04]Even if I don't let it go, I'm playing this out of spite.
[274:32.86]Because I can't understand how awful this is.
[274:36.32]I cannot understand how bad it is.
[274:38.60]I have to keep doing it to keep reminding myself.
[274:40.86]Why?
[274:41.04]This is the last stop.
[274:45.61]I'm getting it right now.
[274:51.98]Did everyone see that?
[275:20.28]Oh my fucking god.
[275:23.50]You've got to be kidding me.
[275:24.54]He's doing it again.
[275:29.46]I don't understand.
[275:40.40]I don't get it.
[275:40.81]I don't know why he keeps doing it.
[275:45.59]This is not possible to do, apparently.
[275:47.51]It just keeps pulling you out.
[275:49.28]Why does it keep doing this to me?
[275:51.38]Why is it doing it?
[275:52.66]I need to be... Somebody... I want a developer to tell me why.
[275:56.62]I want a written fucking letter from one of the devs.
[276:01.73]Alright, settle down.
[276:03.03]No!
[276:10.58]What a letter.
[276:22.12]Send me an email.
[276:33.45]I can't.
[276:34.25]I can't do it.
[276:36.67]I just have to leave it.
[276:39.09]I don't know if it's the controller or how the game is registering the controller.
[276:42.66]I don't understand why it's doing it.
[276:50.08]I would have had, like, again.
[276:51.38]I haven't let go of Y. I just did.
[276:56.86]Can I rebind the aim key?
[276:58.36]I wonder.
[277:04.69]You just suck.
[277:07.25]No, it's not.
[277:08.03]I'm telling you.
[277:13.66]Goddamn contextual fucking pressing buttons.
[277:17.53]It never works.
[277:18.59]It's always awful.
[277:20.51]And people, they still use it in new games.
[277:44.01]I'm sorry.
[278:13.02]I just went full fucking hollow right there.
[278:14.48]Did I do it?
[278:23.01]I don't think I did it.
[278:26.37]Oh, God.
[278:28.99]Alright, this is it.
[278:30.28]This is the end.
[278:31.22]Last one.
[278:31.88]Last one.
[278:32.24]I'm gonna like... Alright, alright, alright.
[278:36.44]There's a guy on GameFAQs forums 12 years ago who posted the same bug.
[278:41.02]Yeah, fuck this game.
[278:44.03]Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[278:50.83]The game facts.
[278:52.32]The game facts for him.
[278:54.78]I feel you, man.
[278:55.96]You and me are the same.
[279:13.26]It's a cardboard master.
[279:19.68]Did everyone see?
[279:24.80]Did you want to survive?
[279:32.27]It's a cardboard master.
[279:47.16]don't do it now I'm so ahead what the oh my god what the oh it's so ahead what is oh my god I'm good
[280:50.99]Stop!
[280:51.51]It's doing it again.
[280:52.17]Alright, this is the one.
[281:12.75]Go, go, go, go, go!
[281:21.21]Start shooting!
[281:29.45]Secure the whole massacre!
[281:31.86]One enemy shot.
[282:24.01]Shoot!
[282:27.61]Well, I've gotta say that's some good shooting.
[282:39.05]Is it dead?
[282:48.85]Right then, let's see what you've won.
[282:52.41]Well, put a bullet in my spleen.
[282:55.62]I never thought you'd be getting this.
[282:57.26]A big prize.
[282:58.90]How did you do it?
[283:01.02]That was horrible.
[283:02.14]That was fucking hard.
[283:04.08]Better than your ma- Ooh, the red dragon.
[283:07.98]And a silver bullet?
[283:08.91]I did it.
[283:10.35]Hooray.
[283:10.91]I got the dragon.
[283:12.21]Hooray.
[283:15.15]I did it.
[283:15.53]Okay.
[283:53.65]Oh, I got a new gun!
[283:54.59]Awesome!
[283:56.24]It shoots as fast as you can click?
[284:04.87]No, it doesn't.
[284:14.44]A red dragon.
[284:17.73]Augments.
[284:18.15]Devastation augment.
[284:19.16]Lucky charm.
[284:19.72]The augment and this weapon allow you to cause more damage to your enemies while taking less yourself.
[284:27.66]Okay.
[284:34.59]Wait, I can just... You clicked too slow.
[284:39.19]He's still pretending to like this game.
[284:46.40]Oh my god.
[284:47.02]Wait, I can just spam it?
[285:00.53]It does less damage than the old gun.
[285:03.77]You know what?
[285:04.05]Fuck this guy.
[285:08.59]Don't take money out of his register.
[285:10.35]It's really loud.
[285:11.42]It is.
[285:14.87]Alright, I did it.
[285:16.01]I win.
[285:16.29]Now I can stop hating everything about this game.
[285:21.09]What's next?
[285:21.49]How about two idiots?
[285:30.54]Please save the game.
[285:31.46]Okay.
[285:43.80]It's got an insane fire rate.
[285:45.00]Yeah, this is actually pretty cool.
[285:47.20]I want to try it.
[285:47.64]Okay.
[285:52.00]Let's do... Let's do the summaries.
[286:00.63]The two idiots, I think, is funny.
[286:03.37]I haven't found this location yet.
[286:04.65]Huh.
[286:07.00]Really?
[286:07.84]Really?
[286:19.00]Speed?
[286:21.20]Zoom?
[286:21.54]Okay, well, I have zoom.
[286:27.14]Sub-targeting.
[286:28.32]Oh.
[286:41.83]Sub-targeting is great.
[286:43.81]I'll get that next.
[286:49.06]Um, I feel like I'm really far across the world right now.
[286:52.36]I should go, yeah, I'm gonna go talk to my wife.
[286:54.06]It's been a while.
[287:05.11]I was so angry during that, and for good reason, too.
[287:07.89]Me and that guy in GameFAQs, we get it.
[287:10.29]We know.
[287:11.01]I have, like, a direct connection to that person.
[287:14.93]I am, like, directly connected.
[287:17.20]We're connected on a fucking spiritual level.
[287:37.29]What is this?
[287:39.19]Oh, bartender.
[287:40.77]I need some money.
[287:42.69]Sorry everybody, this is gonna get boring for like 15 minutes.
[287:47.08]Leather jacket.
[287:47.76]You wrote that 11 years ago.
[287:50.22]Can you imagine?
[287:50.86]That would be next level weird.
[288:03.28]I highly doubt that though.
[288:04.60]Just the right amount.
[288:14.72]This is more interesting than spamming magic.
[288:16.70]Well, now I have the best gun in the game.
[288:26.65]Going around back to where I work?
[288:29.73]That just screwed me up.
[288:31.33]What the fuck?
[288:32.46]First of all, you don't walk around the counter.
[288:36.98]Am I going to stream E3?
[288:40.28]When is it?
[288:44.33]When's E3?
[288:52.19]June?
[288:54.70]June 12th to the 15th.
[288:56.26]Probably.
[288:56.66]I would assume I would do it.
[288:57.66]Yeah, of course I would.
[289:02.22]June 12th?
[289:03.96]I'll do a couple of the conferences like I always do.
[289:06.08]I do it every year.
[289:09.43]Okay.
[289:17.01]There is no E3.
[289:17.57]Yeah, no, there is.
[289:18.43]Alright, what are we looking at?
[289:19.85]25,000?
[289:19.87]30,000 and I'll be done?
[289:26.64]Okay.
[289:47.15]Elden Ring is not going to be there?
[289:48.33]I mean, is Elden Ring going to be like every other project George R. R. Martin touches and it just never comes out?
[289:56.44]Nice one.
[289:59.21]Thanks.
[289:59.73]Yeah.
[290:14.31]That's such a low-hanging comment.
[290:16.75]I know.
[290:17.43]It is.
[290:17.67]That's like the easiest thing to say about that.
[290:23.04]Is he talking shit about how bad I was at the shooting game?
[290:39.19]Serving us drinks.
[290:39.83]In full costume.
[290:40.87]Wow.
[290:41.11]That's a wonderfully poured pint.
[291:08.15]It's 500 bucks every single time.
[291:10.96]I should just sit here until it's 50,000.
[291:11.82]Okay.
[291:12.04]Once I get to 30,000, I'll be done.
[291:35.77]A perfect pouring.
[291:37.61]Get to a million?
[291:40.63]No, that would take forever.
[291:43.84]Look at the head on that.
[291:45.10]Probably could do it through gambling.
[291:51.84]A perfect head on that one.
[291:53.32]675.
[291:53.34]What does the multiplier tap out at?
[291:56.81]10?
[291:56.83]15?
[291:56.87]A perfect pouring.
[292:08.92]Over 10?
[292:11.62]Oh shit, it is 10.
[292:15.84]What can you tell us about next week's stream?
[292:21.43]I would just probably... I wouldn't miss it.
[292:25.01]I would probably be there if I were you and if I was able to be there on Sunday.
[292:28.41]11? 11?
[292:39.39]Does it top out a thousand bucks a beer?
[292:40.95]Okay, I'm not going to stop this until I screw it up because this is a ridiculous amount of money.
[292:47.86]Twelve.
[292:48.30]Twelve.
[293:14.71]Somebody said this earlier and I do kind of agree.
[293:18.47]I could do without the constant voice work, the voice acting that plays.
[293:25.36]My horns are huge.
[293:26.44]Why are they so big?
[293:27.34]Because the whole time that guy, I was about to rip my teeth out.
[293:33.19]Oh, it's Cardboard Massacre.
[293:34.79]It's a Cardboard Massacre.
[293:36.37]Oh, that was embarrassing.
[293:37.55]It's a Cardboard Massacre.
[293:38.59]It's like, please, let me shoot.
[293:39.71]Let me just do this.
[293:44.43]No, those are pig ears.
[293:45.59]I'm making that really clear again.
[293:47.98]You've murdered like 200 people.
[293:52.06]Holy shit.
[293:52.96]This is a thousand dollars of beer.
[293:54.60]Oh my god.
[293:59.26]Maybe I can make... Can I get over like 100k?
[294:00.90]15 multiplier.
[294:15.63]What?
[294:16.83]Oh, do not come over here and start attacking me, please.
[294:19.05]$5,000 per beer?
[294:23.52]I don't think it's going to go that high.
[294:27.72]It's probably going to top out at $11.25.
[294:29.34]Yeah, $15 is it, but this is still ridiculous.
[294:46.67]I dropped it.
[294:47.73]Um, I dropped it.
[294:49.23]It's alright.
[294:49.67]That's it.
[294:50.61]That's it.
[294:51.45]I'm out.
[294:54.89]Damn it.
[295:13.29]So, did somebody just kick the dog again?
[295:21.15]Who did that?
[295:29.88]Don't touch that dog.
[295:31.78]Oh, it's so easy to like you.
[295:50.72]I thought that was funny.
[296:03.82]I want to unequip this.
[296:06.28]Is it melee?
[296:07.26]Or just fists?
[296:11.02]Alright, let's go.
[296:13.54]I was going to go to my wife.
[296:23.18]What?
[296:25.36]People are just talking shit.
[296:27.30]Oh, you like me.
[296:28.12]Okay.
[296:28.44]Yeah, these guys like me.
[296:32.60]Vortex 5.
[296:37.99]Oh, Town Crier.
[296:38.87]We need a new name.
[296:50.29]Dumpling.
[296:52.17]Fear Monger.
[296:53.31]Desperado.
[296:54.11]Sparrow.
[296:54.75]Gunslinger.
[296:56.11]Knobhead.
[296:56.73]Oh, Chicken Chicer.
[296:58.61]I like it.
[296:59.29]Dog Lover.
[297:01.49]Butcher.
[297:01.97]Executioner.
[297:02.63]Bounty Hunter.
[297:03.25]Chosen One.
[297:04.47]Shadow Fiend.
[297:08.57]Knobhead.
[297:19.72]Not the joker.
[297:20.40]How about the chosen one?
[297:21.58]I'll be knobhead.
[297:27.75]I have returned.
[297:59.70]Gray Profit dye.
[298:01.20]Can I drink it?
[298:01.70]Oh, the baby.
[298:02.30]Oh, no.
[298:02.70]Oh, no.
[298:03.14]What's wrong?
[298:29.37]Arm pump.
[298:33.09]I need to do... I need to learn kissing.
[298:34.95]I need more money?
[298:43.56]Alright, alright, alright.
[298:44.38]I'll give you more money.
[298:47.38]I'll load the bank accounts up.
[298:52.66]How much money do we need?
[298:58.22]Set a budget.
[299:01.49]How about like 200 bucks a day?
[299:13.09]More than 25.
[299:14.17]I need to go buy some more stuff.
[299:21.23]Oh, the baby.
[299:22.09]Hold on.
[299:35.04]The gift to the baby?
[299:35.78]What does the baby like?
[299:37.18]Jerky?
[299:48.59]I love you, knobhead.
[299:50.07]I hate you, knobhead.
[299:51.63]Okay.
[300:02.46]What do you like?
[300:04.86]Toy bow.
[300:08.30]Yeah, alright.
[300:08.86]Baby's fine.
[300:09.36]Don't worry, honey.
[300:11.44]I took care of it.
[300:12.38]Baby is good.
[300:13.88]Good to go.
[300:16.58]Is it good to see you too?
[300:19.58]Uh, it's an increased budget.
[300:21.33]How much did you do for the hamburger stand?
[300:23.87]Alright, I'm gonna buy this hamburger stand.
[300:29.17]Alright, let's make it expensive.
[300:31.45]Adjust the prices.
[300:35.73]Buy this one too.
[300:41.20]You know what?
[300:41.96]Buy everything.
[300:49.92]How much is it?
[300:50.34]Can I buy this bar yet?
[300:57.53]How much is this place?
[300:58.23]38,000.
[301:01.27]I'll take it.
[301:07.29]Adjust the prices.
[301:08.05]I know in this place.
[301:10.33]Pretty nice.
[301:11.09]Okay.
[301:36.30]Alright, now I'm going to go do the mission.
[301:41.56]I can do the spire.
[301:42.32]Oh, right.
[301:45.77]I want to do the summoners.
[301:46.49]Yeah.
[301:47.25]This seems like a fun little... This is a fun little game, right?
[301:51.23]Let's do it.
[301:58.38]There's a glitch where if you turn off Wi-Fi, you can turn your Xbox forward by a year and get 10 times your gold income.
[302:05.49]Yeah, I'm not doing the Animal Crossing glitch.
[302:07.53]No.
[302:11.17]Who keeps saying that because they're going to die?
[302:12.97]I have to kill them.
[302:13.59]Who is it?
[302:15.73]Like, this person just keeps saying this over and over and over again.
[302:19.78]They keep saying, you'll never shoot me.
[302:21.98]You'll never kill me.
[302:22.82]You're going to poke your eye out with that rare gun that no one owns.
[302:27.52]Only one exists and you have it because you were good enough to get it.

[303:02.44]The guy under the bridge?
[303:03.20]What do you mean there's a guy under the bridge?
[303:34.00]Oh, it's the gargoyle.

[303:54.83]Fifty gargoyles, my god.
[303:58.91]I was just, I was about to shoot somebody on the bridge.

[304:10.10]What are these breadcrumbs doing?
[304:12.10]Where are you leading me?
[304:12.80]Be sure to collect the eggs, too.

[304:49.49]Carriage driver?
[304:54.09]Why would I ride this?
[305:02.55]Let's go to the Bowerstone Market.
[305:03.61]That sounds fun.
[305:05.61]I can fast travel.
[305:06.45]Why would I do this?
[305:15.97]Well, I can just go to my map.
[305:18.23]It's for RPing.
[305:19.43]You'll get the same loading screen.
[305:23.10]I've written a letter as to why this is in the game.
[305:25.06]34,000.
[305:31.10]Alright, where's the bookstore?
[305:32.96]I need to learn how to kiss.
[305:48.34]I heard another one.
[305:51.68]Wait, what do you got?
[305:52.42]You got something?
[305:57.20]Oh, yeah.
[305:57.44]I'm trying to bump him on purpose.
[306:01.33]What is this?
[306:02.93]Sure.
[306:03.21]Sure.
[306:15.25]Marvelous.
[306:16.07]Very civic-minded of you, I must say.
[306:19.11]I've written down the slaver's last known location on this note.
[306:24.90]Okay.
[306:25.68]Well, civilian rescue details.
[306:29.88]Better get a move on before the poor sods are sold.
[306:34.30]Albie needs you.
[306:35.84]Rescue the slaves being held at the camp in Bowerstone Old Town.
[306:38.70]Let's go.
[306:49.19]What is that?
[306:49.57]What do you sell?
[306:51.15]Meat?
[306:56.57]Mine now.
[307:03.20]You got fish here?
[307:06.02]It's an honor to serve you.
[307:11.08]Nice doing business with you.
[307:18.31]You gotta stay fat.
[307:18.87]Don't remember.
[307:19.45]It was clapping.
[307:36.55]I'm pooping while writing this.
[307:42.51]Isn't the internet awesome?
[307:46.17]Some of it.
[307:48.59]Some parts of it, yeah.
[308:01.61]Alright, we gotta rescue the civilians.
[308:03.89]Where are they?
[308:04.67]Hmm?
[308:22.50]What?
[308:25.37]You're the one who said I was a chicken because I wouldn't read it in the first place.
[308:30.27]Yes, but you're the one who... Hey, look.
[308:33.35]Oh, I'm supposed to do this.
[308:34.75]You have to help us.
[308:35.56]The two idiots.
[308:37.00]He raised the dead.
[308:39.76]He raised the dead?
[308:40.62]Alright, listen, listen.
[308:42.74]You two idiots.
[308:44.54]Mother will kill us if she finds out.
[308:46.22]There were a hundred hollow men in the cemetery.
[308:47.93]The book we found called the Normanomicon.
[308:50.81]A hundred hollow men?
[308:51.69]Seems like a lot.
[308:52.29]Have a vortex?
[308:54.23]Oh, yeah.
[308:54.47]Alright, where's this graveyard?
[308:55.41]I can handle it.
[309:19.93]Where do you think they came from?
[309:22.53]I don't know.
[309:23.17]You summoned them.
[309:24.06]Hold on a minute.
[309:25.38]Next time you want us to explore graveyards, hit yourself with a mallet instead.
[309:30.02]And next time you want to read a book, hit yourself with a giant axe instead.
[309:33.54]Can you two shut up for a minute?
[309:35.26]You're just mad because you can't read ancient languages.
[309:40.21]Oh, yes.
[309:41.27]I wish I could make lots of corpses who want to eat me up here whenever I wanted.
[309:44.85]I knew it.
[309:46.95]Always so jealous.
[309:51.85]Alright, I'll go do your deed, okay?
[309:57.84]Who's that?
[309:58.26]Why is there constantly something going on?
[310:10.65]What's this?
[310:11.05]I implore you, release me!
[310:27.90]What is it?
[310:28.22]Hello?
[310:32.88]Um... Okay.
[310:34.96]I don't... Where's the key?
[310:41.74]I'm trying.
[310:44.95]What do you think I'm doing?
[310:50.60]I don't know what's going on.
[311:02.45]Is this a bit?
[311:03.89]What's happening?
[311:04.51]Why is nobody doing anything?
[311:08.72]I can't do any moves.
[311:10.58]I can't attack.
[311:11.30]I can't press any buttons.
[311:12.26]What's going on?
[311:23.10]Okay.
[311:32.71]I can't do anything.
[311:33.81]I can't press any buttons.
[311:37.68]I guess I'm going this way.
[311:51.11]Everyone was just kind of standing around like, oh, we're just waiting for them, waiting for our cue.
[312:06.03]Everyone's saying, I can't attack them.
[312:08.31]Pressing any buttons didn't do anything.
[312:09.57]Okay, now I have access to my weapons.
[312:18.40]Alright, I have to kill a hundred people.
[312:21.16]Alright, easy enough.
[312:38.05]Get out of here.
[312:38.77]Just kill a hundred of them.
[312:48.09]Seems like we're really, uh...
[312:51.16]Kind of a boring mission.
[312:52.32]We're just gonna be doing this for a while.
[313:09.53]Vortex, let's go.
[313:10.57]Actually, the swords is really effective.
[313:23.22]It's only boring because the way that you're playing it.
[313:25.58]Yeah, I know.
[313:27.06]But that's what I've chosen.
[313:31.82]I'm digging up somebody's grave.
[313:32.88]Alright, come on.
[313:41.51]I need to kill another 80.
[313:42.63]I have the new pistol.
[313:47.41]Yeah, I'll use the pistol.
[313:48.05]I should start leveling up the dexterity.
[313:53.61]Because I can do vortex, and then after vortex, I can just go ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bang.
[314:02.63]Are they... Okay, that was weird.
[314:06.40]How did that happen? ...
[314:33.43]They're spawning underneath the bridge.
[314:54.43]I didn't think the trail mattered anymore.
[314:55.95]Alright, let's see how it works.
[315:01.63]Watch this, ready?
[315:02.17]Oops.
[315:15.01]Pretty good.
[315:15.61]I think I shot a guy. 255%.
[315:43.41]This is too good.
[315:48.69]Oh my god.
[315:49.29]It's so broken.
[315:50.01]I don't even need to use any guns.
[315:53.19]I don't even have to use magic or anything.
[316:02.92]All men are weak.
[316:03.78]Oh.
[316:08.72]Treasure?
[316:15.67]Oh, it's over there.
[316:16.93]Magic is for losers.
[316:20.45]Ban that person.
[316:22.13]Ban them forever.
[316:22.85]I don't want to see them ever again in my fucking chat room.
[316:33.10]Cast spell, gun.
[316:37.67]Are the people still here?
[316:49.35]What just happened?
[317:02.10]What did I just do to this thing?
[317:08.16]Why did I kill this?
[317:09.14]What happened?
[317:14.67]Apparently people liked it.
[317:15.83]I opened a door?
[317:18.01]Whoa, what's that?
[317:25.19]How did I get that?
[317:36.84]Shoot it!
[318:31.34]Again!
[318:38.22]How much was that?
[318:39.84]That wasn't really that much experience.
[318:41.84]With the 220 pro- This when?
[318:42.78]What does that do?
[319:05.81]221 is meh.

[338:38.78]How'd you do that?
[338:39.22]How are you doing that?
[338:47.26]I don't get it.
[338:54.18]How are you doing that?
[338:58.42]I don't know what ASCII is.
[338:59.60]Well, it's happening to multiple people.
[339:01.32]Doesn't that mean multiple people have to do that at the same time?
[339:05.63]Are we funny yet?
[339:12.49]I just don't understand.
[339:27.76]I was supposed to be really mad at that guy until I figured out that that's my name.
[339:30.42]Let me eat something.
[339:33.56]I hope so.
[339:33.98]Okay.
[340:03.15]Am I still fat, right?
[340:04.09]Oh, wait, yeah, I'm gonna be gone for a long time.
[340:07.02]Oh, will I still have a wife when I come back?
[340:08.74]We'll find out.
[340:30.66]You're not even going to say goodbye to your son.
[340:32.04]My son's like one month old.
[340:38.55]What do you mean no dogs?
[340:40.27]Am I pulling my pants down?
[340:41.59]What was I doing?
[340:43.39]Oh, come here.
[340:44.69]It's okay.
[340:46.87]I'll be back.
[341:02.09]Oh, I'm going to take all my stuff and I might as well eat the rest of my food in here.
[341:04.94]Oh, that was a chicken.
[341:23.77]We're fine.
[341:33.09]Didn't realize I even bought it shit At daredevil Oh
[342:01.95]Tattered spire.
[342:10.33]The sounds will be the sounds of your own heartbeat.
[342:16.38]One thing I remember, it's coming up.
[342:43.80]What, um... What is this for again?
[342:49.89]This guy has this gigantic spire that, like, time travels or something.
[342:53.16]He can see the future and... It blew up.
[342:56.42]He wants to find out.
[342:57.04]He needs to go back and find out who did it.
[343:10.76]Just look at this place!
[343:12.88]We've done well casting in our lot with Lord Lucian.
[343:16.18]Whatever he's planning, me and Lil are gonna be set for- Right, I get to go first.
[343:19.45]Get moving!
[343:25.03]Pick up that can.
[343:26.93]I've been with my Lil 13 years, been faithful the whole time.
[343:32.42]If you could see her, you'd understand why.
[343:36.09]Fighting the guards this place feels I'm too slow One thing to say not one
[344:05.19]What is this place?
[344:08.10]Six years I was a Mason's apprentice.
[344:11.24]What are we all doing here?
[344:13.22]How is this possible?
[344:16.36]Oh, kingdom engineering, I reckon.
[344:18.36]But then how's it come back now?
[344:21.20]Oh, here it comes.
[344:24.83]The world outside these marvelous walls is a corrupt, rotting husk.
[344:32.03]Reason is absent.
[344:35.58]Instead of order, find the guy in the crowd on drugs.
[344:39.74]Chaos does not punish evil, nor reward righteousness.
[344:43.58]That'll be hard.
[344:44.98]Chaos cuts innocent lives short, and we're to accept this as fate.
[344:50.80]I beg to differ.
[344:52.91]You stand in the center of a great instrument of change.
[344:58.13]With it, I shall remake the world.
[345:01.47]My creation shall be unrecognizable in its perfection.
[345:08.03]The power alone is not sufficient for such a monumental task.
[345:13.68]It is only through your toil, through your labors, through your conviction that Albion will be transformed.
[345:23.96]Do not fear the sound you hear, the throbbing you feel beneath your feet.
[345:29.11]These sensations will soon be as familiar as your own heartbeat.
[345:33.15]There it is.
[345:35.27]And so long as your heart continues to beat, all that I require of you is obedience.
[345:43.12]Now, sleep.
[345:46.24]Okay, he can do that?
[345:47.98]I like Vortex.
[345:54.07]Nice fucking shit spell.
[346:05.61]Morning maggot.
[346:07.35]Welcome to the spire.
[346:08.77]Hope you like it because you're never leaving of a shotgun caller on You'll eat and sleep here and the rest of the time you will work wherever the commandant assigns you Your job is keeping a scam building this place in line and otherwise doing whatever the commandant tells you without Friar talk You will obey it immediately
[346:35.26]Which brings me to that new piece of jewelry you've got.
[346:38.86]The collar is part of Lord Lucy's... Saw collar.
[346:41.86]Well, you're wearing one too.
[346:43.86]The commandant will explain it to you.
[346:49.36]Main thing is, do what you're told.
[346:51.98]And don't try taking the collar off, because you can't.
[346:55.07]And the penalty for even trying is death.
[346:58.23]And not the quick and painless kind either.
[347:04.18]It's an extra, extra, extra large.
[347:06.92]They had to custom order this one.
[347:11.59]It's not worth the cost, you know.
[347:13.07]If that guy just acts up, just shoot him with a rifle.
[347:20.66]Get a break for it?
[347:23.24]Never mind.
[347:32.84]Sock on.
[347:35.54]You're in safety off.
[347:36.77]Let's fucking start smashing people.
[347:42.84]Why would he have safety on in here?
[348:09.56]I don't like this.
[348:15.71]I didn't really mean to do that.
[348:28.69]Get that man to stop laughing.
[348:31.81]Shut him up.
[348:33.27]Stop laughing.
[348:34.11]I thought that's what they're going to start doing.
[348:42.10]Oh, he started laughing.
[348:42.84]He liked it.
[348:46.04]Hey, it's you.
[348:47.76]We arrived together.
[348:48.76]Oh, hey, Bob.
[348:50.07]How are you settling in?
[348:52.17]Can you believe they put me on guard duty on my first day, too?
[348:56.17]I must have impressed someone.
[348:58.97]Oh, if Lil could see me now.
[349:01.07]She's always loved a bloke in uniform.
[349:04.38]Though I don't think she'd like the mask any more than I do.
[349:06.66]Why are they in there?
[349:09.02]What makes us guards and them, like, workers that we keep prisoner?
[349:29.44]Be patient.
[349:32.26]Though it doesn't give me any trouble.
[349:35.81]Did I talk to you in your head?
[349:36.92]Alright.
[349:40.28]Report to the commandant.
[350:15.92]Commandments?
[350:17.60]Com- Commandant.
[350:22.85]Alright, what do you want me to do?
[350:37.04]I am the Commandant.
[350:39.89]You are recruit 273.
[350:41.33]I was scared.
[350:43.29]It's a scary guy.
[350:45.37]It was assigned to you because I have broken 272 recruits.
[350:50.85]Guarantee you take two lightning strikes to the head and I'll kill you.
[350:56.67]You have been brought here to oversee the reconstruction of the tattered spider.
[351:00.81]Hey, Darth Maul called.
[351:01.85]He wants his head spikes back.
[351:05.01]You probably get that all the time.
[351:09.41]You will do everything I tell you without question.
[351:16.51]Failure to obey will cause the device around your neck to activate.
[351:22.92]This is not a pleasant experience.
[351:24.76]You will lose your willpower.
[351:26.26]Your memories and experiences will be drained away.
[351:28.84]This will continue until you submit.
[351:34.88]I will win every time.
[351:45.97]Torture Sequence and Metal Gear Solid I destroyed every single time.
[351:50.77]Like, I can click the button as fast as possible.
[351:52.47]You're not going to break me.
[351:53.67]Sorry to tell you.
[352:02.75]Nope.
[352:03.53]Not doing it.
[352:08.63]Okay.
[352:09.01]Do it then.
[352:11.07]Go ahead.
[352:17.01]Blow my head up.
[352:17.83]Do it.
[352:18.21]You won't do it.
[352:18.93]You know I'm valuable.
[352:20.76]You have any idea how valuable I really am?
[352:23.30]You know it.
[352:24.58]You can't kill me.
[352:25.62]Your boss would be fucking furious.
[352:36.72]I'm going to call his bluff.
[352:37.40]He's not going to do anything.
[352:41.08]See?
[352:43.64]You're not going to do shit.
[352:49.33]What are you doing?
[352:57.00]I'm fine.
[352:59.44]Oh, oh, what?
[353:00.26]What's up?
[353:00.96]A mosquito's out tonight?
[353:03.46]Are there mosquitoes out tonight?
[353:04.42]What was that?
[353:04.86]I think I felt something.
[353:08.70]Oh, is this evil?
[353:19.75]He's leveling you down?
[353:21.71]I get this back by killing fucking three goblin people.
[353:24.74]I'm not going to do it.
[353:29.43]You're losing XP.
[353:30.47]I'm fine.
[353:32.37]Look at... I've got a pretty big EXP bank account, guys.
[353:41.54]He's not leveling my abilities down.
[353:43.12]Yeah, I'm fine.
[353:46.48]In fact, hey.
[353:48.66]Hold on a second.
[353:49.42]What if I just spend them?
[353:56.04]yeah just hold that thought for one second uh demon guy give me one minute uh chain attack seems pretty good to me yeah I think chain attacks okay while reloading a ranged weapon if you tap y at the moment you hear the reload sound you'll reload instantly cool and what else we got will
[354:21.76]I did want to get time control so I'll do time control two time control three okay what about um dexterity that's all I can really do okay alright no don't take me oh no don't do it your master come on oh you're taking all my points for me you you dastardly vassal I will break you down and then remake you as I see fit
[354:57.54]He's tanking your credit score.
[354:58.92]I hear you have been resisting the commandant.
[355:15.17]I wish I had your strength.
[355:20.07]The commandant made me talk to a recruit this morning.
[355:23.15]He overheard the poor bastard saying he missed his family.
[355:26.85]I'm glad I don't have a family.
[355:30.77]I just had a strange.
[355:33.23]Maybe it's evil turned into Star Wars.
[355:36.41]You know, I hardly notice it anymore.
[355:42.54]It's as familiar as my own heartbeat.
[355:46.78]Oh, he's been he's broken.
[355:49.79]Report to the barracks.
[355:52.49]On my way, sir.
[355:57.25]Recruit 273.
[355:59.45]Report to the detention center.
[356:01.67]Do I get another massage like last time?
[356:03.37]I loved that.
[356:04.77]It felt really nice.
[356:05.41]It felt really good.
[356:07.63]Be patient.
[356:16.21]Time has little meaning here.
[356:27.96]Do I look like Buzz Lightyear?
[356:33.52]Okay, I need to... I have to do a Buzz Lightyear cosplay in the game.
[356:38.06]That's perfect.
[356:38.64]Buzz Lightyear.
[356:39.06]Do they have like a bowl I can put on my head?
[356:41.77]I did.
[356:58.12]I do have more guts.
[357:01.67]No, you're bad.
[357:03.53]You're like torturing people in cells.
[357:05.29]What the fuck are you talking about?
[357:11.87]Okay.
[357:32.12]Nobody's even looking right now.
[357:33.00]I could push this guy off the edge.
[357:37.24]I could run, sprint, and tackle to push this guy off the edge, and I would just say fell.
[357:41.05]Feed the prisoners or starve them.
[357:48.99]Why would I choose starve them?
[357:52.42]I hope this is the food lever.
[358:01.93]What's happening Alright, I'm fine I can resist everything he does he thinks he's really strong, but he is not even close to being as strong as I am Prisoners
[358:28.29]At what point does this thing just run out of battery?
[358:30.61]How do you charge this?
[358:45.66]Making up all the karma lost for killing the villagers.
[358:54.10]Week 137?
[358:56.35]It's like almost two and a half years.
[358:59.37]Oh, my wife is definitely gone now.
[359:02.19]There's no way I have a wife anymore.
[359:05.27]I just left.
[359:05.91]I didn't even say bye.
[359:06.91]The common child wants to see you.
[359:28.15]Uh-oh.
[359:28.75]I'm fine.
[359:29.19]I'm fine.
[359:29.55]I'm gonna try.
[359:30.05]How am I this fat still?
[359:35.41]I don't know.
[359:35.75]I did a lot of storage.
[359:59.28]What I don't know is that I duct taped a bunch of, like, Snickers bars, Reese's, and shit to my body before they put me on the boat.
[360:18.41]They thought I was a big fat guy, and I mean, I am, but a lot of it, a large amount, still is right now.
[360:24.32]I got all kinds of food in here.
[360:29.12]It's in the underwear, too.
[360:30.00]I don't care.
[360:30.38]Oh, wait.
[360:32.50]I dropped that.
[360:32.96]Can I have that?
[360:33.34]Oh.
[360:34.36]Oh.
[360:34.44]Okay.
[360:57.73]Oh, I'm going to be the dog that got into the trash.
[361:17.48]I'm not doing it.
[361:24.73]What?
[361:24.91]I have to take it?
[361:25.49]Alright, I'll take the sword.
[361:27.23]Okay.
[361:30.62]I'll give you ten paces.
[361:32.94]One, two, three, four-
[361:57.15]Well, I guess I am kind of weak he should have died Yeah, what happens when I go to zero Oh
[362:25.73]Yeah, when I'm at zero you can't take anything else from me, so what do you expect?
[362:34.60]Fine, I'll kill him.
[362:35.22]Don't do it again!
[363:07.37]Don't do it.
[363:08.87]Oh my God.
[363:17.87]An unloved task slows the passage of time.
[363:20.63]An eternity passes by.
[363:21.83]Wait, do I... Did I have to stay here?
[363:23.53]Each day the great black walls grew.
[363:25.61]Each dawn grew darker in their shadow.
[363:28.04]And the deeds within the walls grew darker still.
[363:31.78]As years passed, the hero's task seemed ever more impossible.
[363:36.52]Lucien remained behind the great white light.
[363:39.13]Garth remained hidden.
[363:40.63]And others like the Commandant appeared.
[363:42.89]All as brutal and powerful as the first.
[363:46.52]And slowly all thought of freedom or the outside world faded.
[363:50.32]Did I lose?
[363:55.98]No, I didn't.
[364:02.53]No, I'm fine.
[364:11.91]Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[364:22.64]You want to go without food for a week?
[364:25.14]I can arrange it.
[364:28.07]Who's talking?
[364:30.85]Many years later.
[364:39.09]Captain's log.
[364:41.11]Log number 158.
[364:44.34]Very low on Reese's.
[364:45.72]I'm going to have to go under the ones that are in my shoes.
[364:50.08]Those ones are gross.
[364:52.95]Running low on supplies.
[364:54.78]Getting... tired.
[365:22.47]Somebody said, yeah, why am I still a guard?
[365:24.25]Why would they still let me have this job?
[365:27.63]At what point do you just kind of like just lock me away and just be like, alright, well, that guy's not... He's not going to do anything.
[365:33.35]He's not going to do what we tell him.
[365:35.74]Here we go.
[365:36.12]Alright.
[365:36.62]It's been like 10 years.
[365:39.06]Construction of the upper tier begins tomorrow.
[365:43.14]The man guarding the site is overdue reporting in.
[365:48.50]Find out what's happened.
[365:50.60]You can consider this a chance to redeem yourself.
[365:54.85]If you find the man in dereliction of duty, escort him to the torture chamber.
[366:08.48]How did I get even fatter?
[366:11.08]Did I?
[366:11.52]I think I did.
[366:12.42]Yeah, I did.
[366:15.48]How?
[366:15.94]What am I doing?
[366:17.21]How am I getting this big still?
[366:18.71]I do.
[366:20.49]I think I got even bigger.
[366:25.87]I think it's because I'm aging.
[366:27.41]And when you age when you're big in this game, it just kind of makes you look a little frumpy.
[366:47.77]Oh, he's not there anymore.
[366:52.35]You pulled the food lever too many times?
[366:54.07]Okay, where is this person?
[367:24.33]I'm gonna get all good points back for this.
[367:26.81]Search body.
[367:30.15]Steel cutlass.
[367:31.41]Oh boy.
[367:34.58]Oh boy.
[367:35.88]Oh boy.
[367:37.20]Oh boy.
[367:38.24]Oh boy.
[367:39.52]We meet again, hero.
[367:41.98]You came to rescue me.
[367:43.26]Hey!
[367:43.60]But you're no good to either of us with that collar on.
[367:48.85]Oh, you got the collar off.
[367:49.99]There.
[367:51.17]I've removed it.
[367:53.33]It took me years to focus enough will to destroy our collars and that guard.
[367:59.03]I've got nothing left.
[368:00.67]So when trouble comes, it's up to you.
[368:05.09]The only way out of the spire is through the commandant's chain.
[368:08.43]I like how he's magic.
[368:09.85]So ready yourself and let's move.
[368:14.87]Oh my God, I don't want to kill him.
[368:16.25]Turn safety on.
[368:29.45]They know.
[368:34.39]That's right, I'm not.
[368:35.27]I can do this.
[368:43.79]Oh, now you're all in big, big trouble.
[368:51.54]Alright, let's go.
[369:01.79]Time control.
[369:03.49]Ooh, I cut his head off, did I?
[369:27.41]Why did I even say that?
[369:28.31]Wasn't even close.
[369:40.85]Use only lightning bolt.
[369:47.49]Eat them.
[369:58.09]Watch out!
[369:59.76]Watch out!
[370:10.45]Ow, that hurt.
[370:11.45]Okay.
[370:20.90]He spends ten years building up energy and you die in two minutes.
[370:25.56]Well, I've been weak.
[370:26.53]I haven't been able to practice.
[370:46.07]I just got an achievement?
[370:47.27]Time!
[370:53.10]Can they not see me or something?
[371:20.98]One, two, three, go.
[371:27.54]I can.
[371:28.50]I can do it.
[371:28.86]I can release them.
[371:30.49]There is time.
[371:31.17]We're right here.
[371:31.91]Why can't we just do it?
[371:32.57]Let's go get the commandant.
[371:57.60]Stand back.
[372:01.95]He can't see me?
[372:13.54]Here we go.
[372:24.04]Look out the window.
[372:24.98]Where?
[372:25.22]That was us.
[372:25.72]That was us 10 years ago.
[372:26.38]Can you believe it?
[372:28.38]You were looking right at him.
[372:54.97]This guy sounds like the guy from Chopped.
[372:56.53]We have radishes.
[372:59.39]Chocolate.
[373:00.05]And pig... pig stomach.
[373:00.97]Alright, let's fight.
[373:01.65]One on one.
[373:01.89]Fuck, I'm trying to do the time spell.
[373:26.97]Don't stop using time.
[373:28.19]Don't stop it.
[373:31.34]You're gonna fuck us all up.
[373:41.72]This should- did I kill him?
[373:43.88]Oh, oh wait, he teleported.
[373:49.16]Eat the potion.
[374:17.47]I'm not using your sword.
[374:19.25]I'm not a sword user.
[374:20.33]You're gonna tell the mage to use a sword?
[374:23.53]Don't you know anything about RPG classes?
[374:25.58]Give me this.
[374:41.02]Give me the orbs.
[375:02.17]Swords.
[375:06.16]Got him.
[375:08.16]Hey, that's mine.
[375:09.06]What?
[375:12.58]Oh, he needed the experience.
[375:13.88]I get it.
[375:14.20]I've taken all that.
[375:27.52]That was a big kill steal.
[375:28.80]Oh wait, I'll do that too.
[375:31.56]We both did that.
[375:32.20]You just copied him?
[376:00.87]Yeah, that's a pretty cool move.
[376:03.93]That's a cool move, I guess.
[376:08.81]Yeah, well, that was cool.
[376:14.83]Nice flex, but I'm the one that's supposed to be doing that.
[376:18.20]Not you.
[376:24.62]How about that one?
[376:25.98]See, I can do that.
[376:27.12]That was pretty cool, don't you think?
[376:40.12]Holy shit, that was cool.
[376:48.09]I want my gun back.
[376:49.41]This thing sucks.
[376:53.21]Are we just farm experience?
[376:57.11]I feel like this is a great farming spot.
[377:07.10]Mages don't use guns.
[377:08.94]I mean they can if they want.
[377:15.41]They don't have to.
[377:17.03]If you want to be a melee user, you go for it.
[377:42.55]Ow.
[377:44.03]Don't do it.
[377:46.15]What was that health?
[378:04.67]Magic is the best?
[378:05.41]You know, I typically agree.
[378:07.93]I do think magic is the best.
[378:09.85]I love magic in games.
[378:13.17]You know why?
[378:13.61]Because a gun is the same thing in real life.
[378:16.47]A sword is in real life.
[378:18.49]But Vortex 3 is not.
[378:20.69]Yeah, it's called a hurricane.
[378:39.64]Yeah, hurricane is fine.
[378:42.33]But I can't control a hurricane.
[378:50.82]Natural disaster.
[378:51.36]Yeah, but I can't create a natural disaster with my palm of my hand.
[378:54.36]Alright.
[378:57.62]You guys are free.
[378:58.14]Let's go.
[378:58.62]You don't control swords in real life.
[379:02.56]What do you do?
[379:03.12]You hold it and swing at it.
[379:12.28]Get on the boat.
[379:23.57]My wings are a hurricane.
[379:25.99]When was the last time I used a sword?
[379:40.81]Last night to cut a tomato.
[379:51.77]Tell me again how we don't use swords in our daily lives.
[380:07.38]Knives aren't swords.
[380:09.80]Knives are small swords.
[380:19.08]Knives are domesticated swords.
[380:23.68]There's the dog!
[380:35.41]Oh, there you are.
[380:36.01]Good boy.
[380:44.54]You're still going good.
[380:45.48]You're still big and strong.
[380:47.10]It's been 10 years though.
[380:53.58]What a good boy.
[380:54.44]Alright.
[380:57.90]Daddy needs to stop at the nearest Taco Bell.
[380:59.76]Your furry friend has been coming here every day for a week.
[381:02.60]Oh.
[381:03.84]He knew that you would return victorious even before I did.
[381:08.32]Ten years.
[381:09.44]Welcome back, my friend.
[381:12.00]You have done the impossible.
[381:14.52]And Garth, I welcome you too.
[381:17.60]Welcome me?
[381:18.98]You're in my way.
[381:20.40]So please step aside.
[381:22.95]You know much about the Old Kingdom.
[381:24.91]Enough to know you cannot destroy the Spire alone.
[381:28.51]We share a common aim.
[381:30.28]All I ask is that you listen to what we can offer you.
[381:32.94]There's only one more person left.
[381:34.00]Alright, I'll listen.
[381:35.82]But I promise nothing.
[381:38.06]I will go with Garth.
[381:40.46]Hammer is at the inn in Rookridge.
[381:43.26]You should see her before we talk again.
[381:45.37]She'll be overjoyed to know you're back.
[381:46.95]Go see your child.
[381:47.83]I will.
[381:48.35]Oh, and here.
[381:49.13]You'll want this.
[381:51.58]Your old equipment.
[381:52.46]Thank you.
[381:52.90]Ooh, 5,000 reward.
[382:21.73]$100,000?
[382:21.97]I didn't?
[382:30.19]Oh, it's good to see you again, dog.
[382:31.35]Let me take all this crap off.
[382:35.95]Leave my regular clothes back, please.
[382:44.81]Will I have his gloves?
[382:47.85]Headgear.
[382:53.56]I like this.
[382:54.14]I want this.
[382:55.40]This, I like it.
[382:56.16]Why do I have, like, big eyebrows?
[382:58.83]Oh, no, no, no.
[382:59.41]Those are horns.
[383:18.56]I want these.
[383:24.24]Alright, let's go.
[383:52.79]Alright, put that back on.
[383:55.29]Put my red dragon back on.
[383:57.09]It's got augments in it.
[383:58.09]Alright, I know there's treasure, but I... The hero.
[384:07.61]That's me.
[384:09.55]I gotta go visit my family.
[384:10.49]It's a calzone.
[384:21.32]Uh, don't say that.
[384:22.40]You just made me hungry.
[384:23.10]Okay, where's my house?
[384:28.42]Do I still have a front door?
[384:32.55]Why is a window broken out?
[384:39.43]What's going on here?
[384:40.13]Is this even my house?
[384:47.20]You're trespassing.
[384:52.13]I am?
[385:04.05]It's been 10 years.
[385:05.49]Oh.
[385:05.61]Families.
[385:08.16]Gwyneth is happy.
[385:15.64]Very happy.
[385:18.86]Everything's fine.
[385:31.34]Son?
[385:31.62]No.
[385:34.29]I'm home.
[385:50.21]Okay, where's my family?
[385:51.98]Son?
[385:54.94]Your dear old dad?
[385:57.66]Your dear old dad's here, son?
[385:59.20]Son?
[386:04.18]Remember me?
[386:09.18]I know you like this.
[386:10.02]Oh.
[386:27.03]Where's your mother?
[386:37.81]Where is she?
[386:47.52]Where is she?
[386:54.28]Let us see what we can do for you.
[386:56.42]No, I don't want carrots.
[386:57.38]I want crunchy blueberry pies.
[387:02.40]I hope it brings... You bought a fine item.
[387:09.10]What's going on?
[387:13.30]Where's my wife?
[387:21.97]He looks like the town crier.
[387:23.61]He does not.
[387:27.97]Honey, where are you?
[387:33.15]She's gone.
[387:33.97]Where is... Is she upstairs?
[387:36.13]I don't have an upstairs.
[387:42.46]Um, follow me.
[387:47.89]Follow me?
[387:52.77]Come with me.
[387:54.47]I'm your dad.
[387:58.87]Come with me.
[387:59.49]I'm your dad.
[388:00.21]There's somebody that looks like this.
[388:04.36]Come with me.
[388:05.06]I'm your dad.
[388:06.00]I'd be like, get the fuck away from him.
[388:07.34]Get out of my house.
[388:10.54]But, like, what rave party did you just come from?
[388:12.88]This person's, like, going to EDC.
[388:18.25]Hillary, I'm dead.
[388:33.74]I can't even communicate with this kid.
[388:39.94]Doesn't like me.
[388:40.66]Why?
[388:41.02]Hates me.
[388:43.29]What's going on?
[388:52.14]Even the dog did it.
[388:53.20]You don't like us?
[388:59.80]What about this one?
[389:09.06]He just waved.
[389:10.82]Just waved.
[389:13.04]Well... Into the night I go!
[389:30.58]Why does he want to talk to me?
[389:31.70]Do you like the dog?
[389:43.99]Oh, wait.
[389:48.21]Where's my wife?
[389:53.39]In your manor, I'm the owner.
[389:55.41]Knobhead.
[389:56.87]Can I see who lives here?
[389:57.79]Is that her?
[390:05.01]What's my wife's name?
[390:09.85]I don't know.
[390:14.29]I really don't know my wife's name.
[390:18.43]Weneth.
[390:18.97]Right.
[390:19.27]Weneth.
[390:19.63]Weneth.
[390:20.25]Anybody seen Weneth?
[390:29.94]I really don't remember.
[390:32.24]Look in the family logbook.
[390:48.18]Who would it be?
[390:48.66]Expressions?
[390:54.56]Apparently I got disconnected from Xbox.
[391:02.45]No?
[391:04.11]She would show up on the... Wouldn't she show up?
[391:15.72]Are there people sleeping in here?
[391:31.57]Just go to sleep, it's bugged.
[391:35.63]Okay, I'm gonna go to bed.
[391:42.26]Alright, I'm going to go sleep in my bed and then we'll just see what happens.
[391:45.14]She's with the town crier.
[391:55.06]She's not with the town crier.
[391:57.90]We'll not just leave our son sitting here alone.
[392:06.51]Sleep for 12 hours.
[392:08.23]Okay, here we go.
[392:12.45]Where's mom?
[392:22.82]Where's your mother?
[392:26.80]Why can't I get this kid to do anything?
[392:37.08]Check the bar?
[392:51.48]She's probably at the bar.
[392:53.84]Um... You think so?
[392:56.20]Yeah, I don't see her in town at all.
[393:03.08]Her name's Gwyneth, right?
[393:09.04]Okay.
[393:12.02]Greg?
[393:12.38]Annette?
[393:16.81]Alex?
[393:17.05]Alex?
[393:21.82]My son?
[393:23.40]Sally?
[393:24.02]Where's my wife?
[393:26.76]Everybody stop laughing.
[393:30.97]Where's my wife?
[393:33.65]Where's my wife?
[393:34.27]What have you done with her?
[393:36.29]Everybody hates me.
[393:51.08]I think she's... Is she dead?
[393:52.14]You bet your ass you can, Dave the villager.
[394:08.27]Absolutely.
[394:08.89]You can have my autograph.
[394:11.23]How do I give it to you?
[394:12.40]You want my autograph?
[394:15.42]Here you go.
[394:26.53]Where is it?
[394:29.15]Condom.
[394:30.61]Yeah, it's okay.
[394:32.49]Autograph card.
[394:34.21]Here you go, kid.
[394:35.15]Can't use it.
[394:47.29]How do I give him... I want to give him an autograph.
[394:55.19]What the fuck?
[394:57.53]Why does everybody hate my son?
[394:58.77]There you go.
[395:03.49]There's my autograph.
[395:05.51]Why does everybody hate my son?
[395:12.21]Where's my fucking wife?
[395:13.53]I have to use the gift expression?
[395:28.84]Okay, here you go.
[395:29.60]No, I don't want to give it to Kathy.
[395:30.74]I want to give it to this kid.
[395:38.32]I'm about to vortex this fucking stairs.
[395:40.46]Get out of my way.
[395:41.12]I'm trying to target this kid.
[395:42.46]Okay, there we go.
[395:47.06]There you go, kid.
[395:52.34]I autographed.
[395:53.24]What?
[395:59.12]Is she mad because I gave this kid a present?
[396:01.47]What's wrong with that?
[396:02.19]I thought it was funny.
[396:06.25]Well, that's embarrassing.
[396:30.30]Where is my wife?
[396:35.88]What about the kid?
[396:36.86]This is freaking me out.
[396:56.83]I have to get this kid out of here.
[397:04.03]Beef jerky.
[397:04.57]Wait, I think I have ham in my pocket.
[397:06.79]I have like food.
[397:07.47]I think I have it.
[397:08.55]I think I have food, don't I?
[397:12.69]I don't.
[397:16.97]A golden oak leaf.
[397:30.24]This is kind of cool.
[397:34.66]Alright, well, whatever.
[397:35.52]I don't know what to do.
[397:36.14]I don't know why my wife is gone.
[397:37.60]You're not Gwyneth.
[397:42.39]Alright.
[397:44.01]It's a bug.
[397:44.51]Okay.
[397:44.95]Alright, alright, alright.
[397:45.73]Let's go.
[397:59.28]I might come back after the quest is over.
[398:00.72]Okay.
[398:12.71]Alright.
[398:15.66]Here we are.
[398:16.22]If I didn't know better.
[398:18.90]It's me.
[398:19.40]It is you.
[398:22.24]You old bastard.
[398:25.00]Man, you look good considering.
[398:28.93]Look at my deflated stomach.
[398:30.37]You're really here.
[398:32.25]You can sit on that.
[398:34.31]That's a nice chair.
[398:35.61]You did it.
[398:40.67]You rescued Garth.
[398:43.52]I don't want to be back in business.
[398:47.70]I want to be out.
[398:49.90]I want to be done.
[398:52.46]I don't want to keep this fucking bullshit going.
[398:56.88]I don't want to keep this fucking bullshit going.
[399:13.00]Yeah, go see my wife and kids.
[399:15.45]That's right.
[399:16.43]Yeah.
[399:16.57]I'll go check on them.
[399:17.61]Yeah, thanks.
[399:18.05]Thank you.
[399:18.71]What do you got?
[399:19.29]What game?
[399:19.67]Spinner box.
[399:20.07]You better believe it.
[399:21.11]I'm in.
[399:54.83]Alright, let's go.
[399:56.47]This one... I need more of a bet than this.
[400:01.17]Look at how awesome this one is.
[400:02.15]This is a super one.
[400:02.87]I need to level up my gambling skill.
[400:22.52]Come on!
[400:32.08]Put it all on the spinner box.
[400:33.34]Yes.
[400:38.46]Let me just level up and see what it does.
[400:39.86]This is like, that's like a hundred bucks, guys.
[400:49.69]I'm just going to spam until I get there.
[401:02.98]Time control slows the coins down?
[401:05.16]Wait, what?
[401:05.82]No, it doesn't.
[401:13.07]I just want to see what happens when you level up.
[401:14.43]Holy shit, I just got... That was a big hit.
[401:26.28]That was huge.
[401:27.72]That's 500 chips.
[401:34.77]How close am I to leveling up?
[401:38.33]Alright, Chip's got points.
[401:39.79]Alright, points to next level.
[401:41.33]842.
[401:41.37]Let's go.
[401:52.78]I'm at 650.
[401:53.10]I'm fine.
[401:54.80]Oh, the sunflowers?
[401:56.96]Uh, the sunflowers are doing really well.
[401:59.88]Still in the stage of where they're growing very, very rapidly.
[402:03.69]Stocks are getting huge.
[402:08.34]They don't have any buds yet.
[402:09.68]They're becoming big, large stalks.
[402:20.34]Alright, 672.
[402:21.00]The ones I have are supposed to get to be 6 feet tall.
[402:29.89]So, it's going to be really interesting.
[402:34.95]I'll get some pictures for you, don't worry.
[402:37.03]I think I'll snap a few photos.
[402:45.63]We all know it's marijuana.
[402:46.99]No.
[402:47.35]Alright, almost there.
[402:57.61]Come on.
[402:57.95]Just spam.
[403:06.46]I can't imagine sitting here and doing this.
[403:08.44]Like I said, like level 5 gambling.
[403:10.38]This would be so annoying.
[403:13.59]This will take forever.
[403:14.11]This will take hours and hours of time to do this.
[403:16.39]I might get like an expression or something.
[403:32.04]It's possible I'll get an expression.
[403:43.94]Almost.
[403:44.36]Hold on.
[403:53.09]Adjust the bet.
[403:54.05]I can only do 10.
[403:54.63]I'll wait till level 2.
[404:12.10]I don't think I can do time control.
[404:23.61]On 72 left.
[404:24.41]I haven't spent any money.
[404:30.41]So don't worry.
[404:32.80]Change your category to cringe.
[404:34.22]I don't think that exists.
[404:58.17]Alright, five more spins.
[405:00.79]Two.
[405:02.27]Three.
[405:04.17]Four.
[405:04.75]Alright, what happens?
[405:06.25]Five.
[405:10.07]Level up.
[405:12.57]I got five free spins for leveling up.
[405:14.93]Oh no, no I didn't.
[405:26.87]Okay, what do I get?
[405:30.74]Congratulations, your gambler rating has increased.
[405:32.50]You may now access new games and borrow additional gold.
[405:38.21]What?
[405:52.22]That's stupid.
[406:08.09]Okay, let's go see if I can find my wife now.
[406:18.31]Still don't know how to kiss.
[406:19.25]No, I don't.
[406:20.73]Your family has a gift for you.
[406:22.27]Home?
[406:22.55]Okay, let's go.
[406:24.55]Yeah, I'm probably going to call her here soon.
[406:36.77]Did not get to the end of Fable 2, but... Unfortunately, I think... I don't know if we'll... I think we got what we wanted out of it.
[406:47.14]I'm not going to be streaming.
[406:48.00]I won't be live, technically, me.
[406:51.20]I mean, it depends.
[406:52.54]I have obligations to somebody.
[406:58.50]So, Sunday is a stream.
[407:00.54]I wouldn't miss it if I were you.
[407:03.40]But...
[407:05.81]Maybe the week after that.
[407:06.75]Whoa!
[407:08.40]There they are, finally.
[407:15.10]And the kid.
[407:15.52]I already met him.
[407:17.62]He hates me.
[407:28.08]Are you my dad?
[407:30.88]It's very nice to meet you.
[407:32.70]Not my words.
[407:34.22]Any day now, someone will turn up trying to show a small version of that thing.
[407:38.74]Good luck.
[407:40.18]I'm going to be a hero too.
[407:42.16]Ah, good to see you, my friend.
[407:43.26]You'll get tired of hearing that.
[407:45.05]He says it all the time.
[407:46.31]To everyone.
[407:47.05]Unbelievable.
[407:57.54]Yes.
[408:03.90]Good stream.

[412:30.17]Oh god, he's still going.
[412:31.75]Is he still alive?
[412:33.05]I think this guy's still alive.

[413:38.55]Nobody can come into my house.
[413:39.71]This is a safe zone.
[413:40.81]Nobody can come in.
[413:42.53]You can't come into my house, see?
[413:44.99]If you come in here, you're breaking the rules.
[413:46.25]This is a safe spot.
[413:48.03]Yeah, you can't get me in my house.
[413:56.04]Ow.
[413:56.16]Alright, I'm going to bed.

[417:09.54]I didn't mean to shoot the guy on the right.
[417:11.24]I really didn't.
[417:11.78]Are you going to beat the game later?
[417:21.53]It's not going to auto-save, is it?
[417:26.81]No, right?
[417:37.68]No, there's no autosave.
[417:38.40]No, alright, we're good.
[417:42.23]Alright, yeah, I'm going to call it here.
[417:44.85]I'll see you guys next week.
[417:46.95]I don't think... I'm going to be realistic with you.
[417:48.45]I don't think we're going to play Fable 2 again.
[417:50.17]I think I got everything I wanted out of it the last two days.
[417:57.48]But in the event that you do see it again, then we'll play it again.
[418:04.18]But I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[418:07.71]Sunday's going to be interesting.
[418:13.49]I want to tell you what's going to happen, but I would not miss it.
[418:17.39]60% completion.
[418:18.91]Yeah, I mean, the things that are really left to do, that could be interesting.
[418:22.50]I think there's a few more interesting things to see.
[418:26.58]I don't know.
[418:27.00]Maybe.
[418:27.24]We'll see.
[418:27.60]If I get the itch, I'll get the itch.
[418:29.94]If not, then I'll play Power Washer Simulator or something.
[418:34.79]What time on Sunday?
[418:36.29]That is a really good question.
[418:39.25]Probably... Keep an eye on the sus, because I'm going to make it precisely the day.
[418:45.29]Precisely the minute, precisely the hour.
[418:47.23]I kind of need to do a little bit of... I'm going to talk to the person involved and see exactly when they want to do it.
[418:56.59]But keep an eye on the sus.
[418:57.55]It's going to be Sunday, probably evening.
[419:00.91]Sunday afternoon to evening.
[419:03.76]Depends.
[419:05.49]I'll let you know.
[419:07.47]Precisely how late.
[419:08.45]It's not going to be an early stream.
[419:09.77]Let's just put it that way.
[419:11.31]It will absolutely be after like 4 or 5 o'clock Pacific.
[419:14.95]That's a guarantee.
[419:18.43]I'll see you next time.
[419:21.08]Have a good week.
[419:22.14]Thanks for watching as always.
[419:25.88]Hope you enjoyed the stream.
[419:26.98]It was a lot of fun.
[419:27.62]Fable 2 was a lot of fun.
[419:29.00]I talked a lot of shit about the shooting mechanics.
[419:34.11]It was all in good fun, though.
[419:35.05]I don't mean half of those things.
[419:39.45]Hey, but it's a great game.
[419:40.31]I remember it was a very fun game.
[419:41.91]It was very ambitious.
[419:43.65]But it was, um... I would put it up there as absolutely worth playing.
[419:47.79]It was very good.
[419:49.33]It's very funny.
[419:54.16]It's just a fun experience.
[419:55.86]It really is.
[420:00.02]Okay, so...
[420:07.47]I am going to dump you guys on Ludwig.
[420:09.13]I'm playing Pokémon.
[420:14.31]Pokémon Platinum.

[420:19.59]Is that what that is?
[420:22.27]Well, don't be part of the... Don't make it to 150.
[420:23.88]Go say hello.
[420:32.08]I'll see you guys later.
