[00:50.21]Hey guys, good morning.
[00:51.15]How you doing?
[00:54.37]It's Jeremy here.
[00:55.46]Hope you're having a good morning.
[00:58.90]You know, it's 7 o'clock in the morning.
[01:03.17]Not 7 o'clock at night.
[01:05.01]The world has decided, President George Bush has decided, that when it's dark outside, we're going to call it the morning.
[01:12.81]And when it's light outside, we're going to call it night.
[01:16.56]And the reason for this was because, and I understand it completely, night and light, they rhyme, and they're almost the same amount of letters.
[01:26.26]The only difference between night and light is there's an L in one.
[01:30.49]So, I mean, that makes perfect sense.
[01:36.60]Hey!
[01:38.18]How are we?
[01:41.42]Give me one minute.
[01:42.04]I'm going to make a tweet and we're going to play Subnautica.
[01:44.70]Can't wait.
[01:47.09]Meme funerals tomorrow.
[01:48.23]Not today.
[01:48.65]I said February 1st.
[01:49.67]It's January 31st.
[01:52.25]Meme funerals tomorrow.
[01:55.34]You understand?
[01:55.74]See you in a minute.
[02:48.36]Alright.
[02:49.86]So, I don't know anything about this game.
[02:53.88]I truly don't.
[02:56.15]The only thing I really know about... Oh, let me do this too.
[02:59.09]You guys can hear the waves.
[03:02.03]The only thing I truly know about Subnautica is that it's an open kind of survival game where you're on a beach and you go in the water.
[03:10.64]There's monsters in the water.
[03:12.94]It's a scary game too, right?
[03:15.40]I don't know.
[03:16.72]I didn't pay any attention to this game.
[03:19.78]Not at all.
[03:23.46]Like, as zero as you could pay attention to a game is how I've paid attention.
[03:30.82]There's no beach.
[03:31.50]What do you mean there's no beach?
[03:38.32]This is the last time you can count before the meme funeral.
[03:40.60]You know, that is... That's technically true.
[03:46.89]So, let's play.
[03:47.91]Subnautica.
[03:50.99]So I think what I understand from this game is there's equal parts fire and equal parts ice.
[03:57.85]Because, like, sub, we're going into the Earth's crust, where it's very hot.
[04:03.45]It gets tremendously hot down there.
[04:06.81]And Antarctica is the cool water.
[04:08.79]So I think I'm figuring out the game already.
[04:11.28]Center of the Earth with a drill, but sometimes you're in the water and it's nice and cold in Antarctica, right?
[04:17.54]Figured out the fucking game.
[04:18.44]I know the end already.
[04:20.75]Alright, starting the game.
[04:23.85]New game, Survival, Freedom, Hardcore, Creative.
[04:27.95]I'm just gonna crash land on a dangerous alien planet, scavenge resources, manage hunt and thirst and shit.
[04:34.15]You gotta eat and you gotta drink.
[04:35.47]Okay, Freedom, like Survival, but without the hunger or the thirst.
[04:39.81]Survival mode with only one life, no O2 alerts.
[04:45.01]I don't think I'm ready for this.
[04:48.05]At all.
[04:49.52]I think I'm ready for this.
[04:51.84]Build anything with no control.
[04:53.08]This is a building game?
[04:54.14]This is a game where you have to build shit?
[04:59.73]Alright, I'll deal with it.
[05:01.07]Let's do survival.
[05:03.65]I apologize for the incredibly loud sounds that you're gonna hear in about 10 seconds.
[05:10.98]Alright, so you build bases.
[05:14.66]This is just underwater JermaCraft.
[05:24.13]Loading entity cells.
[05:25.33]So, what, do you crash land on an alien planet?
[05:27.39]Let's see.
[05:31.57]Press any button to... Well, that's a pretty bad opening cutscene.
[05:35.66]Press any button to play.
[05:37.66]You're taking me... Where's the immersion?
[05:40.24]There it is.
[05:40.94]There's the loud sounds.
[05:46.92]I knew it was going to happen.
[05:48.94]Do I... Do I get... Okay, I'm launching.
[05:56.59]Okay.
[06:01.22]So there was a- the whole Earth exploded, right?
[06:05.54]Everybody died but me, I got in the escape pod.
[06:08.04]Nah, my fuckin' Coca-Cola Diet Coke just fell down.
[06:12.67]That's my only means of survival.
[06:16.11]Ahhhh.
[06:21.69]Well, this is bad.
[06:26.19]How do I get out of the fucking roller coaster?
[06:28.97]Ah shit, the Tower of Terror crashed.
[06:32.07]I just wanted to go to Disney World with my family.
[06:34.81]What the fuck?
[06:37.75]Pick up the fire extinguisher.
[06:40.01]Holy shit, how many other families were on this ride?
[06:42.28]Alright, so that's how you do that.
[06:54.97]My iPad doesn't work.
[06:56.09]Booting in emergency mode.
[07:02.70]Got the SEGA opening there.
[07:04.40]An optimal outcome.
[07:15.29]Okay.
[07:15.79]Keeping me alive on the alien world.
[07:22.55]Okay.
[07:24.05]Let's tab to open or close the PDA.
[07:28.85]One, two, three, four, five.
[07:29.99]Just like corresponding quick slots.
[07:32.70]One, two, three, four, five.
[07:34.84]Okay, all I have is this.
[07:35.90]Use the fabricator.
[07:38.80]I can apparently eat.
[07:39.66]I have deployables, personal sustenance, or resources.
[07:47.53]Alright.
[07:48.43]I don't think I want to do this right now.
[07:50.59]I've used the repair tool.
[07:53.50]So, do I need to get, like, a tool?
[07:58.36]Equipment tools.
[08:00.40]Scanner repair tool.
[08:02.40]I need silicone rubber, cave sulfur, and titanium.
[08:08.57]Medical kit.
[08:10.03]Pick up first aid.
[08:12.27]Alright, so let's... The game is too loud.
[08:18.91]I toned it down.
[08:21.14]So what happened?
[08:21.80]Alright, so yeah, we got a fabricator there, we got a hatch.
[08:24.79]Let's just climb up the hatch and get the opening cutscene done with.
[08:28.93]This is the first giant monster.
[08:35.69]The game is quiet?
[08:36.71]No, it is not.
[08:40.04]Alright, so... See?
[08:49.78]I know.
[08:51.14]Where's Epcot?
[08:53.06]Jesus Christ.
[08:56.13]I just wanted to go to downtown Disney after this.
[09:00.67]Where have they taken us?
[09:01.57]Alright.
[09:03.57]So should I go investigate the exploded Disney ride?
[09:07.86]Okay.
[09:08.70]I got to move on from that one.
[09:10.38]Is that a bathtub?
[09:11.30]Go to the bathtub.
[09:11.92]Alright.
[09:14.32]This is kind of cool.
[09:20.22]What's in the bathtub?
[09:23.20]Nothing.
[09:24.62]Wait.
[09:25.58]I can go in this?
[09:30.48]Alright, well, that was... I just went inside that, like, that thing's mouth.
[09:35.18]Alright, so, obviously, I... I have to go pick up equipment and stuff.
[09:39.98]So, what did I need to repair this shit?
[09:42.08]Do I have to swim down?
[09:45.98]And then in, right?
[09:47.70]Okay.
[09:48.14]Or the escape pod.
[09:48.78]Let me see something.
[09:52.35]So, I need damaged secondary systems.

[12:24.36]We can pick up acid mushrooms.
[12:26.52]You actually have to pick them up.

[12:31.77]That's really cool.
[12:33.57]I like that.

[12:47.88]What do you mean oxygen?
[12:49.36]Oh.
[12:53.44]I can hold my breath for 45 seconds.
[12:55.80]So I just do like a seal thing where I dive in the air.

[13:19.21]Alright, let's just keep looking up.
[13:20.05]Let's keep picking shit up.
[13:27.04]I really do love that.
[13:28.96]There's something really fun about just doing a free willy to get oxygen.
[13:34.56]I look for, like, stuff on the ground.
[13:40.49]You can cook them?
[13:41.83]How do I put them in my pocket?
[13:45.33]I'm doing a whole lot of acid mushroom picked away, but break limestone, can't I?
[13:48.85]Okay, copper.
[13:56.51]No, don't go in here.
[13:57.27]First I gotta, like, do a dive.

[14:07.90]This guy's breath is... Wait, let me just... Whoa, mushrooms.
[14:11.40]Alright, I have as many mushrooms as I can possibly hold.
[14:16.14]Ooh, sulfur.
[14:19.92]Where is it?
[14:21.79]Alright, I just heard a lawnmower start.
[14:23.89]Huh?
[14:24.55]What the hell is that noise?
[14:27.10]What the hell?
[14:27.52]Is that making all the noise?
[14:28.94]What the fuck was that?
[14:30.02]The thing just exploded.
[14:30.92]Okay.
[14:36.12]Okay, uh, well... Let me just get some more oxygen.
[14:45.47]Let me get this... I need to get the sulfur down here.
[14:47.31]We need that to make the repair tool.
[14:52.12]What is that?
[14:52.90]Oh, come on.
[14:53.64]No!
[14:57.30]How do I stop that from happening?
[14:59.10]Can I, like, kill this thing?
[15:01.02]Cave sulfur.
[15:01.96]What?
[15:02.94]My inventory's full.
[15:03.78]How do I... How do I... Oh, shit!
[15:11.44]Okay.

[15:18.64]Oh, no.
[15:19.14]Oxygen.
[15:20.38]Oxygen!
[15:23.81]Okay.
[15:25.33]We're good.
[15:28.20]Okay, I didn't know.
[15:34.55]I'm treating this game like Diablo II.
[15:36.93]Where you just click everything.
[15:38.11]Alright, how much cave sulfur do I need?
[15:40.41]Let's just clear this place out of cave sulfur.
[15:42.53]That sounds like a good idea.
[15:45.94]Uh, what about this guy?
[15:48.12]No.
[15:48.92]I don't think I need any more than that.
[15:50.90]Wait, what's that?
[15:51.94]Limestone outcrop.
[15:53.07]Pick it up.
[15:54.59]Nice.
[15:54.97]Alright.
[15:55.47]I think... Let's go check.
[15:58.03]I need rubber.
[16:02.23]Oh, should have turned to nighttime.
[16:05.23]Okay, let me go back here to see what I have.
[16:06.81]This is kind of cool.
[16:11.64]This is actually pretty enjoyable.
[16:15.17]Yeah, I never gave this game a thought.
[16:17.15]Solely based around the... Wasn't this one of those games that was in early access for like seven years?
[16:23.25]And it came out finally.
[16:24.81]Alright, let's get in here.
[16:30.58]So, use fabricator.
[16:31.74]Let's just see.
[16:32.28]Alright, resources.
[16:33.92]Basic materials, electronic base materials.
[16:36.32]Titanium.
[16:38.16]I need titanium.
[16:41.44]Cool.
[16:42.63]Alright, how many did I get?
[16:45.10]Uh, electronics.
[16:46.54]Battery.
[16:48.12]Personnel.
[16:48.52]I need repair tool.
[16:49.32]Okay, I need silicone rubber still.
[16:55.45]I can't make that.
[16:56.83]How do I make silicone rubber?
[16:57.89]So I need creep vine seed cluster.
[17:01.75]For that.
[17:03.86]Interesting.
[17:04.34]What can I make right now?
[17:05.10]Batteries?
[17:05.48]Might as well make you.
[17:10.76]New blueprint power cell.
[17:13.66]Oh, shit, I need to eat food.
[17:15.75]Cooked food.
[17:17.31]Cooked blood.
[17:17.85]Oh, shit, I forgot about this.
[17:19.13]Do I have any canned tuna?
[17:22.49]Water.
[17:22.81]Filtered water.
[17:24.31]Alright, I need a bladderfish.
[17:25.17]I need to drag a bladderfish up here right now.
[17:32.28]Shit, it's so dark.
[17:37.50]Maybe I should craft a light first.
[17:39.84]Is there a bladderfish?
[17:44.06]No, underwater.
[17:44.80]Wait, Gary!
[17:47.38]Okay, so what do I do with Gary?
[17:48.78]No, shit.
[17:49.40]No, pick him back up.
[17:51.61]Just grab this dumb, like, Tron fish.
[17:54.67]What is this?
[17:58.91]What does that mean?
[17:59.51]Pick up floater?
[18:00.41]What the hell are these things for?
[18:08.64]No, there's a lot of information.
[18:09.68]Alright, let me just focus on the task at hand.
[18:12.88]I need a bladder fish.
[18:14.94]I need silicone rubber.
[18:19.28]First, I gotta cook food.
[18:21.61]So, I need a bladder fish.
[18:23.69]There is a bladder fish.
[18:25.23]So, come with me.
[18:27.45]I'm dragging you up.
[18:31.33]I'm going to squeeze the juice out of you.
[18:36.65]I don't understand.
[18:37.25]What do you mean thirst?
[18:39.28]Just go underwater and go like... And then you're fine.
[18:44.30]There's like 500 trillion gallons of water around me.
[18:48.35]Just go under and just inhale it.
[18:58.26]You, by the way, do not do that.
[19:00.93]Let me just make that really clear.
[19:02.43]I am not a survival expert.
[19:04.73]So please, please do not, under any circumstances, do that if you need to survive where there's salt water.
[19:11.73]Because that'll kill you.
[19:12.67]You'll die.
[19:13.39]It's not going to happen.
[19:17.32]Alright, so I can make a scanner.
[19:18.40]I'm going to make this.
[19:22.36]I feel like this is pretty important to have. ...
[19:27.96]So I can record, I can like hold the button down on things.
[19:30.03]Deployables.
[19:32.31]Waterproof locker.
[19:35.75]Equipment.
[19:37.13]Standard O2 tank.
[19:39.71]Ooh.
[19:40.97]Let me make that.
[19:44.19]Yeah, just, yeah, exactly.
[19:47.07]Just bring a Brita water filter with you and dunk it under and let it filter it.
[19:53.70]Tools.
[19:54.84]Alright, I'm getting there.
[19:58.46]Okay, power cell.
[20:00.76]I need a drink.
[20:01.96]I need to eat.
[20:02.98]Cooked food.
[20:04.24]I gotta bring a Garyfish.
[20:05.44]Wait, do I have any?
[20:06.48]Fuck, I had a Garyfish in my hands.
[20:07.90]How do I open up the inventory?
[20:10.55]Alright, so where is the water that I just... Okay, no.
[20:15.95]I want water.
[20:17.51]Oh lord.
[20:18.33]Okay, hold on.
[20:19.09]Drink the water.
[20:20.55]Okay, cool.
[20:24.01]Amko the Terrible just gave $100.
[20:28.23]Looking forward to when you figure out this is a horror game.
[20:34.09]Thank you, Amco the Terrible, for your 10,000 bits, your $100.
[20:38.55]Much appreciated, dude.
[20:45.97]That's... Thank you.
[20:47.83]I have heard a lot about this game, how it gets scary, the scary monsters.
[20:51.66]But I'm going to be prepared.
[20:53.64]I'm going to be completely and totally prepared.
[20:56.24]We're going to 100% complete this game.
[20:58.40]I'm going to unlock every blueprint.
[21:00.88]And I'm going to record every single one of these as my own voice.
[21:05.56]So I'm going to submit to Subnautica a voice pack for them.
[21:10.58]With every single voice of here replaced with my voice.
[21:14.50]By the way, none of that's true.
[21:16.18]Absolutely zero of that is true.
[21:18.74]So, I gotta go pick up a Garyfish.
[21:21.29]Save the game, just in case something horrible happens.
[21:24.59]Alright, let's go.
[21:25.11]Let me get a Garyfish.
[21:29.49]We've survived one night.
[21:35.25]Okay, Gary.
[21:36.34]Garyfish?
[21:37.34]There's one right there, isn't it?
[21:38.84]Come here.
[21:41.62]Get over here.
[21:43.50]No, that's a fucking peepo.
[21:44.50]I don't want you.
[21:45.95]I want a... I want Gary.
[21:50.33]Where's the Gary fishes?
[21:53.63]Right there?
[21:55.15]There's one.
[21:55.85]There's a Gary fish.
[21:56.47]Come here.
[21:58.21]Come here.
[21:59.89]Stuff him in my wallet and let's go make some food.
[22:06.79]That was a very loud sound.
[22:11.38]Alright, let's fabricate him into some food.
[22:15.64]Oh shit, I can... Alright, well I can cook pretty much anything.
[22:22.52]Nice.
[22:27.92]That's supposed to be disgusting.
[22:31.72]Alright, let's eat that before I die.
[22:36.42]So, what is this?
[22:38.41]Is this my health?
[22:40.44]Should I take this?
[22:43.18]Do I have 48 HP right now?
[22:44.60]Is that how this works?
[22:45.56]I need to get rid of these.
[22:47.67]Composed of multiple organisms and symbols.
[22:49.69]I have too many of these.
[22:50.61]I don't want these many.
[22:51.81]How come they don't stack?
[22:55.03]Cave, sulfur, tile.
[22:55.81]I need that rubber-silicon thing.
[22:59.71]So I should heal then.
[23:01.82]Okay.
[23:02.74]So that was designed for me to get healed.
[23:07.46]I'm going to throw all these in the trash.
[23:10.57]I need creep vine seed clusters.
[23:14.35]You got it.
[23:17.64]Oh, fuck.
[23:18.08]I can't drop this here.
[23:19.04]Well, whatever.
[23:22.24]Eat the mushrooms?
[23:25.82]Uh, I will eventually.
[23:26.68]Let me, like, store those.
[23:27.68]But first, let's pull out the scanner.
[23:32.15]Let's pull out the... Did I just scan myself?
[23:37.27]God damn.
[23:37.89]That, like... This is a horror game.
[23:40.41]SCAN HIM!
[23:42.99]Ah, that was a headshot.
[23:45.17]Did you see that fucking headshot there?
[23:51.15]Ah, table coral.
[23:57.00]Why am I treating- does this thing- does this run out of batteries?
[24:00.20]It does, doesn't it?
[24:03.98]I would guarantee this runs out of, uh... runs out of battery.
[24:10.34]Just waiting for another one of those stupid things to show up.
[24:15.18]Quartz.
[24:16.50]Got it.
[24:17.82]Limestone chunk.
[24:18.70]Scan it.
[24:24.27]Alright, pick up the titanium.
[24:27.83]Probably should... Should I be using the gun to do that?
[24:30.72]Oh, shit.
[24:31.78]My... Just... Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[24:35.78]Oh, no.
[24:37.33]What happens if this runs out?
[24:38.47]What happens if you run out of oxygen?
[24:40.36]Oh shit!
[24:43.02]How do I get out?
[24:44.62]No!
[24:46.30]Come on!
[24:56.55]Okay.
[25:00.28]So, let me, let me, alright, I, I, now I have to, I understand, I have to really sincerely pay attention to, uh, to that.
[25:07.64]Alright, you got it.
[25:10.00]My frames died?
[25:10.94]I would, uh, yeah, I saw my frames, like, exploded there.
[25:13.62]Alright, I understand now.
[25:16.40]Good thing we didn't do hardcore mode.
[25:19.61]I get it.
[25:20.03]I understand.
[25:21.12]I'm not going to fuck around.
[25:22.30]Now I understand.
[25:23.76]That is very, very much an attention that I have to be paid to.
[25:28.08]So, self-replant.
[25:29.26]I already picked it up.
[25:29.84]It's fine.
[25:30.36]Self-scan.
[25:33.08]Self-scan complete.
[25:34.64]Okay.
[25:36.40]So I get through here.
[25:38.49]Pick up the quartz.
[25:39.61]Get it all together.
[25:40.97]You can't fuck around.
[25:41.87]That's something I'm very, very closely realizing this.
[25:45.95]Once you get down to about 30, I gotta get out of here.
[25:51.43]Cave sulfur.
[25:52.51]I'm looking for the creeper.
[25:53.89]Creepvine.
[25:58.12]Titanium.
[25:59.98]Alright, get back up to the surface.
[26:03.56]I'm gonna scan the peeper in a minute here.
[26:07.93]Yeah, I'm not gonna mess around the whole time.
[26:09.39]Like, look, we can have a little bit of fun.
[26:10.99]Rabbit ray.
[26:11.45]Come here, come back here.
[26:14.27]Boomerang.
[26:17.68]Okay.
[26:18.36]Boomerang scanned.
[26:19.26]Flatterfish.
[26:21.12]I want to take him for food.
[26:25.45]God damn it.
[26:27.21]I feel like I'm playing Symmetra.
[26:28.55]Alright.
[26:29.51]Rabbit Ray.
[26:30.03]I can't pick him up.
[26:30.71]Let me scan the paper.
[26:37.57]When do I get to deploy my mines?
[26:39.21]Alright.
[26:41.71]Come here.
[26:43.65]Just pick up all these fishes.
[26:44.83]Because I'm just going to make a bunch of food.
[26:51.28]This dude Boomerang already got him, right?
[26:53.72]Yeah.
[26:54.90]Let's get a couple more Garyfish, a couple more Peepers.
[27:00.22]Pick up a couple more Mr. Popper's Penguins and we'll be... Wait, scan him.
[27:06.07]Yeah, I had just as much trouble playing Symmetra that I do as this thing.
[27:10.43]And a couple more Peeps.
[27:12.47]No, come here.
[27:17.57]Alright.
[27:18.95]Let me go back to the boat.
[27:22.13]First of all, just... God damn it.
[27:26.00]Alright, just... Let's just keep, like, a few of them.
[27:34.61]Back to... Over here.
[27:40.83]Did I play Symmetra when she got her flying shield?
[27:43.06]No.
[27:44.40]I stopped playing Overwatch pretty much at the... Who's the big Ghost in the Shell person?
[27:56.02]The Ghost in the Shell funny robot people?
[27:58.98]What the hell was the name?
[28:00.52]Osiris?
[28:02.34]Osimo?
[28:03.72]Osimo, yeah.
[28:04.83]The Honda robot.
[28:07.29]Fabricator, let's make some food.
[28:09.43]Cooked food.
[28:10.21]Cooked peeper.
[28:18.42]Can I hold on these for a long time?
[28:19.98]How long do I get to have these for?
[28:27.90]Osmosis Joan.
[28:29.89]I need water still.
[28:30.87]That's fine.
[28:32.27]Materials.
[28:32.93]Basic materials.
[28:33.79]Let's make glass.
[28:39.24]Um, I'll make some glass, I guess.
[28:43.92]They do rot.
[28:45.42]Ah, okay.
[28:48.08]I gotta make another battery.
[28:49.54]What is this?
[28:50.16]Equipment?
[28:51.52]Pipe.
[28:54.56]Floating air pump.
[28:56.50]A chain of pipes can be used to transport breathable air from a functional pump.
[29:02.49]Floating device that pumps air into pipes acts as starting point for pipe chain.
[29:09.83]I'm just kind of making stuff.
[29:12.11]Hopefully this is not a bad idea.
[29:13.67]Electronics.
[29:15.89]Okay, so you're telling me I can pump in oxygen?
[29:17.69]Do I have like a locker or something?
[29:22.49]Okay, storage container.
[29:23.79]That's what I'm talking about.
[29:28.81]Just get it all in there.
[29:29.61]How do I like put all in?
[29:34.45]Alright, now let's take out the scanner, the fire extinguisher, the pump, the flare, the crone, the warrior, the stranger, and... Okay, that's fine.
[29:51.14]Nutrient blocks and water.
[29:52.32]Alright, let's just have this shit.
[29:55.48]I mean, I don't have any pipes, so I might as well just put that back.
[29:59.88]I'm gonna drink the water, and I'm gonna eat the food.
[30:03.58]Just, like, actually eat these things to get good hunger.
[30:05.88]Alright.
[30:09.06]Now I'm good to go.
[30:10.62]I actually can go explore for a little while.
[30:12.32]Put this down.
[30:15.96]Data bank.
[30:16.64]Blueprints.
[30:17.49]Alright.
[30:17.85]Let's go get the creep vine.
[30:21.89]I am ready.
[30:23.33]How do I get things in my inventory?
[30:24.57]Like, how do I drag things to my inventory?
[30:27.73]Okay, hold on.
[30:28.37]Standard O2 tank.
[30:31.45]I believe you just do it like this, right?
[30:35.47]Maybe not.
[30:36.19]I think I actually have to go into my inventory.
[30:40.81]This is not a good game for somebody with ADHD.
[30:44.04]I feel like it is.
[30:44.60]I feel like it is.
[30:46.20]I feel like I could just go around and walk around and look at stuff and scan things.
[30:50.22]And enjoy myself.
[30:52.47]Probably.
[30:53.45]Hey, look, if I start to get bored, then I'll just stop playing.
[30:55.97]But, you know, kind of cool.
[30:59.95]I don't usually like games like this, but a lot of games that are in this category do this great thing where they throw way too much at you in the very first 10 minutes.
[31:12.24]But I feel like there's just enough that they throw at you here where I understand what's going on right now.
[31:17.26]And that's very, very hard for me to say that typically in a game.
[31:20.26]Got him.
[31:20.53]Ready?
[31:22.17]Headshot!
[31:24.61]Oh, nice.
[31:27.37]Yes, I know.
[31:28.27]I made that joke already.
[31:30.19]Deal with it.
[31:30.57]That's what we do on this stream.
[31:32.43]We repeat the same joke a hundred times.
[31:36.25]Until people can't stand me.
[31:45.43]Are these oxygen bubbles?
[31:47.77]They look like oxygen bubbles.
[31:48.90]What was the thing I just broke?
[31:54.00]Oxygen, right?
[31:56.54]Why can I not... Wait, is this going to work?
[31:59.48]Do I have to pick them up with my mouth?
[32:00.62]There we go.
[32:05.76]Cool.
[32:06.54]I knew that's what that was.
[32:10.35]So, you know how disgusting this is?
[32:13.63]I always was curious about this.
[32:16.03]Alright, so if I was underwater with somebody, right?
[32:20.33]And I had an oxygen tank.
[32:23.47]And I was breathing in the oxygen.
[32:24.96]Done.
[32:29.48]What the hell are these things?
[32:32.74]Oh my god, scared him!
[32:36.78]Alright, uh, so... I was trying to make my point.
[32:42.75]Wait, at least I got a... They're not still coming over here, are they?
[32:47.63]Um, so if we were underwater... Like, let's say I was underwater with somebody.
[32:53.03]And, like, I had an oxygen tank.
[32:56.55]And you didn't.
[32:58.31]Would you be able to survive if I breathed in the oxygen tank and then moved away and like breathed down your throat?
[33:07.55]Because that's what was happening with this thing.
[33:11.55]You know what I'm saying?
[33:15.39]No.
[33:16.61]It wouldn't work.
[33:21.67]Why wouldn't that work?
[33:23.38]What if I did it real quick?
[33:24.50]Because oxygen turns it obviously to CO2.
[33:28.44]but like carbon dioxide.
[33:30.03]But what if it happened really quickly?
[33:31.33]What if I went right down your throat quickly?
[33:35.09]So like I breathe in, quickly go out.
[33:36.79]Like there's still oxygen in my esophagus, right?
[33:40.25]When does it convert to carbon dioxide?
[33:42.09]It has to like go into your lungs and be processed as oxygen then out.
[33:46.55]But what if it comes in and out really fast?
[33:48.33]Does it have time to process?
[33:53.25]There would be still oxygen in there.
[33:57.81]Uh, let's just keep going.
[33:59.41]I need to find some metal.
[34:00.28]I need to find a creeper.
[34:01.88]There's a life form over here.
[34:05.04]If it comes out, it's no longer oxygen.
[34:06.58]But I don't know, I'm not sure I believe that.
[34:09.86]Because, um... Wouldn't it still be oxygen in the esophagus?
[34:15.90]If I breathe in and breathe it out really fast.
[34:17.74]And I'm talking like I sneeze down your throat.
[34:21.64]Yeah, so like I take in the oxygen and I have to sneeze at the same time.
[34:24.78]So it's like I go... Down your throat.
[34:29.18]What the fuck was that?
[34:36.92]Uh, Gassopod?
[34:37.98]Are these, like, manatees?
[34:39.84]Hold on, let me get that.
[34:41.30]Alright, well, uh... Uh...
[34:58.96]Okay.
[35:01.88]So, gasopods kill you.
[35:10.15]If you sneeze down my throat, I will fucking kill you.
[35:14.15]I'm not saying I'm going to sneeze down your throat.
[35:15.98]I'm just asking, like, a purely mathematical scientific hypothesis here.
[35:21.90]If I breathe down someone's throat...
[35:25.47]after taking a hit of oxygen, will they be able to survive?
[35:28.89]And I'm talking like within one second of taking the oxygen in my mouth.
[35:36.10]Alright, so let's... I just need to find a creeper vine, whatever the hell that is.
[35:47.39]That's a very generous hypothesis.
[35:52.75]You guys know what I'm talking about.
[35:59.29]If I spit in your mouth, does that quench your thirst?
[36:02.85]Well, that depends.
[36:04.75]Did you have Hawaiian punch in your mouth?
[36:08.23]Because it might... You're talking about the most thirst-quenching substance known to man, Hawaiian punch.
[36:15.54]I'm not sure.
[36:16.30]Did you just take a sip of that?
[36:19.96]How much Hawaiian punch is in your bloodstream, is what I want to know.
[36:24.83]Where is this vine?
[36:25.59]Oh.
[36:30.84]Uh, coral shell plate.
[36:31.96]Can I break this?
[36:32.58]I don't think so.
[36:39.38]Does it say where, like, the creepy vine is?
[36:43.31]Data bank.
[36:45.09]Life forms.
[36:45.93]Coral.
[36:47.25]Fauna.
[36:49.29]No.
[36:49.67]I don't know what the hell I'm looking for.
[36:52.29]Limestone.
[36:52.75]I think I need to find it first, right?
[36:55.27]Equipment repair tool.
[36:58.24]Habitat.
[36:58.96]Aquarium.
[36:59.80]There's a lot of stuff going on here.
[37:04.61]Scan the moon.
[37:05.17]Alright, doesn't it look like... That just kind of looks like it's floating.
[37:12.45]Like 500 feet in the air.
[37:14.47]Doesn't it?
[37:17.05]I feel like that's not that far away.
[37:20.10]I don't even feel like that's a planet.
[37:25.37]That's some kind of bird.
[37:27.13]That's a weird alien bird on this planet.
[37:35.14]Alright.
[37:36.84]I need to find a creep vine.
[37:38.56]Are these creep vines?
[37:40.72]No, it looks like that.
[37:48.62]I don't know.
[37:49.70]Creep vine.
[37:50.44]Metal salvage.
[37:52.30]I might as well just pick this up.
[37:56.00]Scattered wreckage.
[37:56.88]I need a flashlight, too.
[38:01.08]But, you know, that's just a pee-pee.
[38:03.66]Creep vines are big and green.
[38:05.39]Okay.
[38:09.43]Blue palm.
[38:16.63]Can't pick it up?
[38:17.57]No.
[38:18.47]I can just scan it.
[38:20.59]That's not a creep vine right here?
[38:23.00]That looks like a creep vine.
[38:27.05]Creepvine.
[38:27.65]Creepvine.
[38:28.73]They're also long.
[38:29.85]Okay.
[38:33.13]Creepvine?
[38:33.91]No, this is a bush.
[38:35.87]Creepvine right there.
[38:36.61]I can see it.
[38:38.71]Those are creepvines right there, I think.
[38:46.46]Big and green, you said, right?
[38:49.98]What am I doing with this?
[38:51.48]Oh.
[38:52.24]No, no, no.
[38:52.64]Those are the... Oh, God.
[38:53.66]That just kills my frame rate so bad.
[38:55.16]Alright, I've got to be careful.
[38:56.95]I need to scan these guys.
[38:57.87]Is that a... Okay, does that attract enemies or something?
[39:04.17]How far away can I be to scan these guys?
[39:05.55]I don't want to instantly die again.
[39:07.35]Oh, shit.
[39:09.81]Why do these guys laugh?
[39:15.52]So, I don't think I can scan him.
[39:17.16]Because he's going to throw those out and kill me.
[39:22.05]Yes, I can see you've been playing Castlevania as well as Subnautica Come here And I can't got gas upon Yeah, this is psycho man is
[39:49.40]I know.
[39:50.04]I know about oxygen.
[39:53.22]The color of their tail represents how threatened they are.
[39:57.24]Well, that's quite a tell.
[39:58.68]Hey, gasopods, don't go play poker anytime soon.
[40:05.87]Oh, man.
[40:06.39]You would be folding all the time.
[40:15.65]Okay, where the- where's a vine?
[40:17.63]I need to find a vine.
[40:22.80]No, that's coral.
[40:29.70]Come on, give me- give me, like, some credit.
[40:31.26]That was a very funny, funny joker.
[40:35.44]No, I'll just find mushrooms.
[40:36.88]Why- these apparently are so easy to find.
[40:39.04]Where are they?
[40:41.58]How about replace, like, half the acid mushrooms with creep vines?
[40:46.00]Now I'm just going to go through the funny tube.
[40:49.23]Why doesn't that... That should play a horn sound when you come out of it.
[40:55.31]Wait, there's a vine next to me?
[40:59.81]I have to go deeper?
[41:04.96]How much deeper?
[41:05.66]It's too dark to see.
[41:10.84]Stop swimming and go in a line until you find him.
[41:15.21]Okay.
[41:15.33]Okay.
[41:17.28]What about these bugs?
[41:21.18]Okay.
[41:27.15]There's a brain coral.
[41:28.41]Let me scan this.
[41:32.91]Okay.
[41:34.55]Let me do my hypothesis.
[41:37.15]He's going to breathe down my throat.
[41:38.31]Just so I don't have to go up.
[41:46.43]How about over here?
[41:49.40]They're in their own biome.
[41:52.26]Oh wait, I think I need one of these, don't I?
[41:53.76]Shuttle bug.
[41:55.28]Yeah, I didn't scan one of these guys yet.
[41:58.35]I can't pick them up though.
[42:02.71]Let's just go this way.
[42:08.69]Mm-hmm.
[42:11.05]Straight ahead.
[42:15.86]Looking for a shuttle vine.
[42:23.41]What is that?
[42:24.65]Okay, alright.
[42:25.31]I thought that was just somebody squashed a fish.
[42:29.18]There's the one fin, there's the other fin, there's a squashed head, and there's his three teeth.
[42:35.60]I thought that sounded like some giant stepped on him.

[42:59.42]This is the way I was going before.
[43:00.48]This is where the gas people were.
[43:04.91]I think I may have found them.
[43:13.65]These look like vines, but they're also surrounded by these things.
[43:22.90]Are these things alive?
[43:23.96]There it is.
[43:24.34]Creep vine.
[43:29.82]I'm just exploring the area, just walking around and looking at stuff.

[43:36.16]And like pick up the fucking drone fishes?
[43:39.35]Excuse me.
[43:40.51]You have a license to be down here?
[43:41.95]Give me a fucking plus 10 for that one.
[43:45.31]Yeah, the FAA don't let you come down here.
[43:47.25]Plus fucking 10.
[43:48.96]How do I pick this up?
[43:51.58]Oh, fuck you.
[43:52.60]How do I pick it up?
[43:53.38]Do I have to like harvest it?

[44:04.93]How do I actually, like, pick up the vine?
[44:07.77]I need, like, a knife or something?
[44:10.21]What is that?
[44:10.67]There's something down there.
[44:12.23]Like a box.

[44:40.57]So that means I have to craft a knife.
[44:42.03]So how do you make a knife?
[44:51.59]Need the seeds, not the leaves.
[44:53.07]Interesting.
[44:54.91]So, do I need a knife?
[44:55.33]Or can I just pick them up?
[44:56.35]Looks like they're right here.

[49:01.06]Thanks everybody for watching.
[49:07.80]The whole goal was to repair your pod.
[49:09.98]And did it with a little bit of trouble.
[49:12.01]There was a monster there that we kind of had to dodge.
[49:13.73]You know what I'm saying?
[49:15.63]But we're okay.
[49:22.01]Wait.
[49:22.87]Repaired?
[49:23.19]Alright, play message.

[49:30.58]99,000, 10,000 hours is what?
[49:31.34]Let's get a calculator here.
[49:32.40]What, I don't have my calculator.
[49:33.62]It's not sitting right here.
[49:35.02]10,000 divided by 24.
[49:56.44]Alright, so that's in 416 days.
[49:58.14]So that's like a year and a half they'll come and get me.
[50:02.64]You got it.
[50:03.18]Alright.
[50:03.82]I need to eat.
[50:04.82]No, I'm good.
[50:06.36]So now that I have the knife, I can go back out here.
[50:12.18]Now, what do I need to do?
[50:13.72]What did that even do for me?
[50:17.51]Radio communications, medical kits.
[50:19.91]Well, I guess I can just take this.
[50:24.86]That's, so, power, 10, I don't know what this even does.
[50:31.15]Skate pod, fabricator, alright, so let me just see what I got.
[50:34.09]What do I want to go for now?
[50:35.59]Because now I have... The floating pump, scanner, repair tube, flashlight, battery, and glass.
[50:43.12]I want to make one of those right now.
[50:46.80]Uh, battery and glass...
[50:51.53]Do I not have pipe?
[50:54.52]Or is it flashlight?
[50:55.72]It's in an O2 tank.
[50:58.42]Wait.
[50:59.52]What?
[51:03.18]There it is.
[51:03.84]Flashlight.
[51:04.29]Battery and glass.
[51:05.01]I need battery and glass.
[51:08.75]Okay.
[51:11.83]Battery is those stupid mushrooms in Copper Ore.
[51:15.46]Don't I have like a shitload of those just sitting in here?
[51:21.74]Yes, I do.
[51:22.64]Alright.
[51:24.22]There's a ton of these.
[51:24.94]I have too many of these.
[51:29.76]What the fuck are these for?
[51:30.66]I need copper ore.
[51:34.10]There we go.
[51:34.77]I can do that, at least.
[51:39.89]Battery.
[51:45.89]And I need glass.
[51:48.24]Which means I need two quartz.
[51:50.58]Shit.
[51:51.46]Okay, two quartz.
[51:56.88]So let's go get two quartz.
[52:00.20]My inventory is just glass in the box.
[52:03.08]Oh, there is glass in the box.
[52:06.30]Nice.
[52:07.44]Would you look at you?
[52:09.92]Look at you.
[52:11.74]Giving me all that, all those important data.
[52:15.76]Flashlight.
[52:19.43]But streamer, you have glass already.
[52:23.83]Alright, now.
[52:25.91]Let's get myself situated.
[52:28.69]Let's store a bunch of shit that I don't need.
[52:30.14]Let's bring a couple of flares.
[52:31.86]Just in case.
[52:33.96]Food bricks, get rid of these.
[52:35.98]Put the titanium in the box.
[52:39.26]Um.
[52:42.18]I wish I could.
[52:42.64]Okay, I can't.
[52:43.16]I have to keep these stupid creep vines.
[52:47.73]Can I like cut them now?
[52:56.06]Well, that's fine.
[52:56.64]Alright.
[52:57.08]Cut the flashlight.
[52:57.76]Let's go back down and start doing some... Let's do some exploring.
[53:05.93]What do you mean the quantum detonation?
[53:07.89]What are you talking about?
[53:10.99]Where's the quantum detonator?
[53:19.34]There's a quantum detonator?
[53:25.30]Are you sure I should bring the hair dryer into the water?
[53:33.41]Yeah, that thing's gonna blow up.
[53:34.53]I know.
[53:36.87]I know.
[53:37.63]It's gonna explode any minute now.
[53:38.91]That's cool.
[53:43.31]That thing's gonna blow and it's gonna be like, oh cool, it fucking exploded.
[53:47.35]You guys have already seen this like a hundred times.
[53:50.25]I'm like the 700,000th person to stream and make videos on this game.
[53:55.58]Can't pick this up.
[53:58.90]Apparently this is nothing.
[54:04.13]I'm just going to go straight ahead.
[54:05.15]Another one of these.
[54:08.15]Nothing in here.
[54:08.65]What?
[54:09.45]How?
[54:11.19]One of these fucking dumb fishes take it?
[54:16.24]Anything in this box?
[54:19.00]Nope.
[54:22.70]Nope.
[54:25.72]Nope.
[54:31.71]Nothing in there either.
[54:36.11]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[54:36.89]Watch out.
[54:37.29]This guy's an angry guy.
[54:38.93]I just used the fire extinguisher down here.
[54:51.49]Alright.
[54:52.07]So, let me get the full oxygen.
[54:54.15]Should I go and, like, investigate the ship, or what?
[54:57.73]Or is it open enough for me just to kind of go wherever I want?
[55:02.65]Just to salvage things and make stuff.
[55:09.44]Uh, that is something I don't know what this is, but I'm scared about that thing over there.
[55:12.92]Okay.
[55:14.86]Fragment.
[55:16.14]Okay, Seaglide Fragment gained.
[55:17.75]One out of two.
[55:19.81]Grav Trap Fragment.
[55:23.16]One of the two.
[55:23.74]So you just have- I'm assuming you just have to find this stuff.
[55:27.20]Congratulations, survivor.
[55:28.88]You have exceeded your weekly exercise quotient by 500%.
[55:33.16]Thanks.
[55:33.42]Data indicates that swimming was your favorite activity.
[55:40.78]So she's very tongue-in-cheek telling me that I just walked around in a circle for the whole first half of me playing the game.
[55:48.94]Our indicators say that you were just swimming in a circle, you fucking idiot.
[55:55.30]Okay, let's go back up.
[55:56.74]Let's get some oxygen.
[55:58.10]Let's pick up the Gary fish.
[56:04.88]No, you know, I should have just... There we go.
[56:12.10]I need the flashlight now.
[56:13.52]Turn it on.
[56:13.96]So, I'm just gonna keep going over here.
[56:16.70]I mean, what's the worst that could happen?
[56:22.98]Didn't somebody say that I need to, like, take out the knife?
[56:29.07]Reap vine sample.
[56:30.09]Alright.
[56:33.17]I'm just going to get a few of them.
[56:35.44]I got a new blueprint.
[56:37.90]Watch out for the hammerhead.
[56:40.56]Is he carrying a box?
[56:42.28]That guy has a... Oh.
[56:47.46]I thought this was a gun.
[56:51.80]For a second I was like, thank god I crafted the gun.
[56:55.21]No, it's not a gun.
[57:03.51]Okay.
[57:08.20]What about in this thing?
[57:09.16]What about in the giant... What about in the giant prosthetic leg?
[57:12.12]Is there anything in here?
[57:15.12]Scan it.
[57:16.08]I already have it scanned, I think.
[57:19.24]Let's keep going over here.
[57:24.95]Just blind them.
[57:27.13]Can you, uh... Can you fart in my face, please?
[57:29.45]Thank you.
[57:35.97]The more and more I stray away, the more scared I am of this video game.
[57:41.61]Look, we're in uncharted territory now.
[57:45.56]What could possibly be down here?
[57:49.42]Monsters.
[57:53.66]Sandstone outcrop.
[57:58.78]Lead.
[57:59.50]Nice.
[57:59.94]Okay.
[58:01.42]There are new fish down here that I need to... What's it?
[58:03.68]A sandfish?
[58:04.52]Swordfish?
[58:05.38]Hoopfish.
[58:10.33]How many more Dr. Seuss things can I come up with?
[58:12.47]Alright.
[58:13.89]Specimen.
[58:14.71]Infection.
[58:15.71]Spadefish.
[58:28.18]Okay, I need to get oxygen.
[58:32.65]Nearby cave.
[58:38.99]I'm just so panicked to get to the top every time.
[58:41.57]Come on!
[58:43.73]Oh!
[58:46.73]Alright, I need to come up with a way... I need a better tank, obviously.
[58:50.30]Because that's seriously... I'm gonna keep forgetting about that and I'm gonna die.
[59:00.37]I need a bigger oxygen mask.
[59:04.09]The ship's going to blow up.
[59:05.99]Don't worry.
[59:06.43]It's going to be like the ball drop, guys.
[59:08.10]I'm not going to miss it.
[59:10.78]Floater.
[59:11.26]Let me scan these.
[59:17.34]We'll get to sing the outro to when the new year happens.
[59:21.38]We'll count it down.
[59:22.49]I like scanning stuff.
[59:25.49]It's fun.
[59:30.59]Reginald.
[59:34.17]My inventory is full, though.
[59:38.32]Of course I have 30 seconds of oxygen.
[59:39.76]Alright, just put it away and swim faster.
[59:45.54]But I missed New Year's last year.
[59:46.96]I have a radio signal call?
[59:48.36]What is that?
[59:48.80]How do I pick up the radio?
[59:55.83]How do I answer the phone?
[59:58.49]I've got a long way to go.
[60:02.61]I think I have a couple more blueprints, though, I want to look at.
[60:04.53]I want to see how to make another oxygen tank.
[60:09.82]We'll count it down.
[60:11.02]We'll do a 10, 9, 8, 7, 6.
[60:21.02]You know, it'll be like 10, 9, 8, 3, 2, 1.
[60:28.95]I'm going to play the song, too.
[60:30.13]I'm going to make sure I get that ready.
[60:36.13]We'll count down the new year.
[60:43.87]I missed the massive sea monster.
[60:45.95]I think there's a lot of them in this game, so... I think we've got plenty of that to see.
[60:56.34]For the escape pod.
[60:57.36]Okay, so let me get it ready.
[61:02.64]Just give me one second.
[61:04.38]Yeah.
[61:06.30]What's it called?
[61:07.06]Old Lang... Old Lang Syne?
[61:09.28]What is it called?
[61:13.70]Old Lang Syne.
[61:15.58]Old Lang Syne.
[61:22.40]This is it, right?
[61:32.57]This is not correct.
[61:37.37]This is like the ending to Firewatch.
[61:39.17]This is not, like, Auld Lang Syne.
[61:44.27]Yeah, great... Great, like, Hobbit theme song version of Auld Lang Syne.
[61:53.24]No, we have to have, like, the crowd singing it.
[61:59.86]Here it is.
[62:01.67]No, I don't, like... Alright.
[62:05.51]So I'm gonna be ready for this.
[62:11.48]I just have an ad and I don't want you to hear the ad.
[62:15.60]Just get like a death metal version.
[62:16.88]Alright, well, thank good, great YouTube.
[62:21.08]The ad crashed my computer.
[62:22.72]No, hold on, here we go.
[62:23.36]Alright, here we go.
[62:28.08]I'm pretty sure this is it.
[62:29.92]Yeah, that's a good one to have.
[62:32.38]So here we go.
[62:33.06]Climb the ladder.
[62:34.00]Is it gonna happen?
[62:36.26]Are we gonna get a countdown for this?
[62:39.84]I need to listen to the radio, right?
[62:43.03]Alright, radio.
[62:45.89]Pre-recorded message, okay.
[62:47.82]Okay.
[62:48.06]Three, two, one.
[62:48.48]Alright.
[62:48.72]So how do I know when it's going to explode?
[62:51.24]Am I going to get an indicator?
[63:15.92]I need to know when we need to count down the new year.
[63:17.42]Alright, let's do personal.
[63:21.36]Tools.
[63:22.72]Pathfinder.
[63:27.53]Deploys holographic pathfinder disks used to map a way back out of caves.
[63:32.97]Interesting.
[63:33.43]Alright, where's the other... Prepare tools, scanner, equipment.
[63:41.65]First aid fins, high capacity.
[63:44.64]I need my standard tank, two glass, four titanium, and silver.
[63:48.60]Where the hell do you get silver?
[63:55.99]Where the hell do you get that from?
[63:58.41]Well, let's just make some titanium.
[64:03.43]Pathfinder sucks.
[64:05.63]Uh, fiber mesh.
[64:08.87]Let's make some more silicone.
[64:10.27]So we can get rid of the shit in our inventory.
[64:13.84]Air bladder.
[64:18.72]Fins?
[64:19.20]Ooh, wait a minute.
[64:21.68]Ooh, I want these.
[64:25.10]I like that.
[64:25.78]I like that.
[64:35.55]Okay, sea glide, mobile vehicle bay, grab trap, waterproof locker.
[64:41.27]So that stays in the water.
[64:43.59]I need food.
[64:44.41]Let's cook a couple of spade fishes.
[64:48.13]Recommend the sea glide.
[64:49.01]You got it.
[64:49.91]You got it.
[64:53.43]The locker sucks.
[64:54.37]Okay.
[64:55.63]I need water, too.
[64:57.67]Man, surviving is fucking hard.
[65:01.15]Whoa, whoa, wait!
[65:06.02]Oh shit!
[65:07.26]Alright, here we go!
[65:09.24]Here comes the... New Year's Eve!
[65:13.04]Ten!
[65:14.10]Nine!
[65:14.96]Eight!
[65:15.72]Seven!
[65:16.70]Six!
[65:17.76]Three!
[65:18.80]Two!
[65:19.26]What?!
[65:22.85]Happy New Year!
[65:24.25]Hey!
[65:32.84]Oh, yeah.
[65:33.74]Kisses.
[65:35.96]Hey, you over there.
[65:37.04]Happy New Year to you.
[65:39.05]Oh, wow.
[65:43.45]Happy fucking New Year.
[65:44.95]Alright.
[66:01.94]I'll see you next time!
[66:03.04]Goodbye!
[66:04.11]Oh, there you go.
[66:11.23]I would have laughed so hard if like a plate hit me right in the fucking head and I died.
[66:15.92]It didn't even destroy the ship.
[66:17.24]What the hell?
[66:24.52]I thought the whole thing was gonna explode.
[66:31.14]Alright, New Year's resolutions.
[66:34.13]What's my New Year's resolution is going to be to have way more whipped cream, always ask for whipped cream, and accept whipped cream when a coffee shop asks me.
[66:47.32]Because now I always say, no, no, no, thanks, no whipped cream.
[66:49.52]Oh, would you like whipped cream on that?
[66:51.50]No, I don't, that's, no.
[66:52.12]I'm going to say yes every time.
[66:55.44]Hot chocolate?
[66:56.20]Get some whipped cream on there, please.
[66:58.52]Oh, but you're getting like a Frappuccino from Starbucks?
[67:00.80]Would you like whipped cream?
[67:01.64]Yes!
[67:02.46]Please do.
[67:09.72]Alright, uh, save the game.
[67:13.32]Now, is it like, can I visit that ship now?
[67:17.04]Am I gonna die if I go over there?
[67:20.28]Alright, that's too salty.
[67:24.66]Shit, I need, those things are too salty!
[67:28.28]Oh well.
[67:31.94]I need water.
[67:32.64]At least I have the fins on now.
[67:36.65]I need to drink.
[67:37.81]So I can't really do anything until then.
[67:40.17]So let me put these away for now.
[67:43.33]Fuck.
[67:45.77]I have to get rid of this shit.
[67:47.99]I have so many vines.
[67:49.91]I'm going to craft all these down.
[67:55.58]Just craft it all down.
[67:56.70]Just make fiber mesh and shit.
[67:58.12]Just have it... I don't want to have this stuff in my inventory anymore.
[68:00.96]Take the rolled up carpet.
[68:10.40]Glass.
[68:10.98]Just use everything up so I can actually have space.
[68:15.46]Make some lubricant.
[68:20.05]Making vehicles, sure, sure.
[68:21.61]Alright, what else we got here?
[68:24.09]Make first aid kit, we can make another, uh... Alright, that's fine.
[68:29.09]I just need to get this random junk out of my inventory.
[68:31.69]Because I've taken up too much space.
[68:34.30]Again, like, let's do this.
[68:35.28]Uh, I need to get rid of these fucking things, too.
[68:40.66]Alright.
[68:42.84]Again, here we go.
[68:44.72]Back it up.
[68:48.84]Resources, base materials, titanium.
[68:56.48]Lubricant.
[69:00.31]We need to clear out this inventory.
[69:09.45]Personnel.
[69:11.44]Equipment.
[69:13.44]Alright.
[69:14.24]Now we're on the right track.
[69:17.25]sea glide I don't know I don't I don't know how to make the sea glide the locker you guys have told me is a piece of crap so I'm not going to use it okay let's switch the container here that's better alright now at least I'm not gonna have a huge problem here I need water too and I need water badly very badly we have to go squeeze a guy
[69:46.77]Wait, somebody said the locker was bad.
[69:50.47]Were they just joking with me?
[69:54.77]Metal salvage.
[69:55.43]I need a Gary fish.
[69:56.51]Or I need a bladder fish, actually.
[69:57.80]Come here.
[69:59.24]I need a few of you.
[70:01.02]Because I want to drink my fill of water.
[70:05.74]That should be alright for now.
[70:08.02]Inside the ship again.
[70:08.84]Hello!
[70:10.26]Thank you!
[70:13.84]50% of this game is looking at the wall.
[70:18.23]Uh, water.
[70:24.39]Wait, do I... Wait, hold on.
[70:25.41]So I can make water, and then I can make, like, H2O disinfected mineral water?
[70:29.78]I can make smart water?
[70:31.52]Does it cost $2 extra?
[70:35.18]And... Titanic.
[70:39.92]Eat a Tide Pod.
[70:41.02]Ooh, Tide Pods.
[70:46.35]I can't believe... I cannot fucking believe that that shit is a thing.
[70:53.92]I honestly can't believe it.
[70:58.56]Alright.
[70:59.58]This is good.
[71:00.34]My inventory is fine.
[71:01.24]Although I need to use this titanium for something.
[71:06.45]It's not worth making advanced water?
[71:07.95]Really?
[71:10.49]Alright.
[71:11.83]I need to... I need to find silver.
[71:16.13]So am I going to go over here now?
[71:18.09]I'm going to investigate this.
[71:23.71]We're going right for the ship.
[71:24.77]It's time to go to the ship.
[71:31.02]Somebody told me to stab the coral.
[71:32.60]Really?
[71:36.38]Oh, damn.
[71:38.32]Look at that.
[71:38.68]What, am I going to stab this guy?
[71:40.26]Okay.
[71:45.02]Ooh!
[71:45.80]Okay, I got some brain coral.
[71:48.58]Did I already scan it?
[71:52.22]So I can just scrape stuff off?
[71:59.98]Let's go check out the ship and just see what it is.
[72:03.69]Have the knife.
[72:04.83]No, I want to swim.
[72:06.07]I am feeling this faster swimming.
[72:07.87]It is much, much better to swim at this rate.
[72:14.75]Lifepod 3.
[72:15.81]Crew reported.
[72:16.59]There's sea... Alright.
[72:17.65]No, no, no, no, no.
[72:18.19]No, change of plans.
[72:18.75]We're going this way.
[72:22.25]Fuck that.
[72:22.51]We'll do that later.
[72:23.07]There's a distress signal here.
[72:28.73]I'm gonna be just like a superhero.
[72:36.50]I just heard a whale.
[72:39.36]Um... That looks like a giant... That's big, whatever that is.
[72:45.53]Whatever is in my field of view right now is big.
[72:52.27]It's like Mother Brain from Metroid.
[72:57.58]Oh lord.
[72:58.20]Are these things hostile?
[73:05.98]I'm just waiting for Tom Cruise to show up.
[73:09.52]These things are like the War of the Worlds.
[73:12.36]Oh god, okay.
[73:14.05]Is the tentacle gonna swing and slap me?
[73:19.01]Scan it!
[73:20.19]Reef back.
[73:20.82]It'll take a long time to scan.
[73:29.27]Indigent life reef back.
[73:32.57]Okay, so it is not a threat.
[73:33.41]Oh, cool.
[73:33.85]That's really, really interesting.
[73:35.35]So it's just a moving island.
[73:36.67]Should I pop some of the zits on its back?
[73:39.01]Is he going to get angry if I pop his zits?
[74:04.18]I don't know.
[74:04.44]I feel like he wouldn't be mad.
[74:05.82]Rogue Cradle.
[74:09.39]Is there an egg in here?
[74:10.59]Look, it's like an egg.
[74:11.69]I think I gotta get in here.
[74:13.27]Is this gonna hurt me?
[74:19.75]No.
[74:20.25]I can't get... Alright, I guess I'm... Let's... Something over here, too.
[74:26.86]Eat this.
[74:27.56]Okay.
[74:31.40]What is this?
[74:33.48]Break Barnacle.
[74:38.66]Uh... Sil- Nice.
[74:41.74]Finally.
[74:44.60]Silver Ore.
[74:47.35]I can now make the better oxygen tank.
[74:53.83]Copper.
[74:56.03]So he just has this all over him, huh?
[75:00.97]Don't worry, dude.
[75:01.43]I'm just getting rid of all your blackheads.
[75:05.32]Uh, what is that?
[75:06.46]Can I not do anything with this?
[75:10.00]No, I don't think so.
[75:14.28]Any more of those on his back?
[75:16.72]Not that I can see.
[75:18.42]Alright, please, uh... Give me some oxygen, please.
[75:24.68]Okay, what else?
[75:28.58]You got nothing?
[75:32.04]What is that?
[75:32.49]Papyrus?
[75:33.27]Papyrus?
[75:36.76]uh it's just it's just something to look at same thing with the uh with the digimites what's that Pokémon did you redo you don't say just just like freeze this frame and paint like little eyes and a mouth on those what are they called digi rotos or something cut this grass it doesn't do anything
[76:09.04]Uh, can I cut this?
[76:12.99]No.
[76:16.59]Um... I think that's it.
[76:19.31]At least the shit that's on his bag.
[76:20.71]Oh, no, no, no.
[76:21.75]Always double-check.
[76:27.68]Can I cut into here?
[76:33.26]I don't believe I can.
[76:37.30]Oh shit, the crew that I need to rescue.
[76:39.08]Where are they?
[76:39.98]Over here.
[76:40.18]Alright, cut the tail.
[76:44.62]And get his tail part.
[76:46.40]And then make a new helmet.
[76:49.78]Should I swim up his ass?
[76:57.58]That was very immature, I'm sorry.
[77:06.00]I don't like going all the way up.
[77:07.11]I don't like the noise it makes.
[77:08.13]And it makes my computer lag.
[77:12.01]Alright, let's take out the scanner.
[77:14.25]No, put it away.
[77:14.87]I want to swim faster.
[77:17.55]Lifepod 3's shallow crew reported their sea glide is damaged.
[77:25.52]That was a bad joke.
[77:26.56]I wasn't even trying to make a joke there.
[77:27.76]I was just kind of being stupid.
[77:35.24]Bad computer.
[77:36.14]I don't have a bad computer.
[77:39.38]I have a bottom-of-the-line computer.
[77:45.47]That means that it is so bad that it is, in fact, it's the last thing on the list.
[77:50.29]In the list of... Why the... Alright, let me be careful here.
[77:55.05]Apparently it's right here.
[78:00.12]I don't like this.
[78:01.32]I really don't like this at all.
[78:05.24]See, that's why.
[78:05.80]I have a little baby knife.
[78:10.60]Okay, here it is.
[78:11.56]Any crew in here?
[78:19.47]Abandoned PDA.
[78:20.65]Open the data box.
[78:24.89]What's in here?
[78:29.23]Compass.
[78:33.62]Okay.
[78:35.38]Anything else?
[78:36.14]First aid kits?
[78:38.93]Any shit on the ground I can take?
[78:40.11]I don't think so.
[78:47.17]What about the surrounding area?
[78:49.99]Let me get... Hold on.
[78:57.98]Doesn't look like anything else is here.
[78:59.16]I have to get new blueprints, though.
[79:05.95]Can I, like, smack anything?
[79:09.01]Can't, like, break this open or hit something?
[79:12.96]I guess not.
[79:15.70]So I can make a compass.
[79:18.14]Don't know why.
[79:18.84]Interesting.
[79:22.90]Yeah, where's the sea glide?
[79:25.62]There it is.
[79:26.91]The whole reason why I came over here.
[79:31.39]So now I have three out of three.
[79:33.49]I can make a sea glide.
[79:36.75]I don't like how she says acquired.
[79:38.81]Acquired?
[79:39.39]Alright.
[79:46.40]So let's just check a couple of other small things over here.
[79:50.98]I see some hearts.
[79:53.78]I see a box.
[79:56.77]Mobile vehicle bay fragment.
[79:59.47]Cool.
[80:00.47]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[80:01.35]Okay, go, please.
[80:02.91]Don't die here.
[80:06.47]Alright.
[80:07.43]Geez, I keep feeling like my game's gonna crash.
[80:10.79]Alright.
[80:12.03]Now, I have the parts to make a sea glide.
[80:15.90]Let's see what it takes.
[80:16.52]I need to drink food, too.
[80:27.77]Save game.
[80:30.79]I'm super dehydrated, I know.
[80:34.44]I'm not gonna die.
[80:35.22]Why do you guys think I'm gonna die?
[80:37.28]I'm still very much alive.
[80:38.58]I love drinking food.
[80:45.28]Yeah, I do too.
[80:47.63]The game does not autosave.
[80:48.93]Okay, that's good to know.
[80:52.57]Read the crew log.
[81:00.07]Where can I do that?
[81:02.03]Databank.
[81:05.05]Beacon manager, photo manager.
[81:06.49]Are you going to take photos?
[81:09.65]Where's the crew log?
[81:18.90]Silver-based wiring kits are an essential component of many habitat modules.
[81:26.52]Data downloads?
[81:30.57]Oh, it's in the data bank.
[81:31.47]Okay.
[81:36.55]Do it on pod.
[81:37.21]Let's see if I can signal the aliens.
[81:50.16]Okay, no.
[81:51.34]Stop that, please.
[81:52.22]Just go.
[81:52.56]I was going to make like an alien.
[81:55.36]I was going to do like Morse code.
[81:58.30]Alright, I am going to do Morse code.
[82:00.02]Can you guys tell me what I'm going to say here?
[82:02.81]Let's see.
[82:04.01]Let's see how smart some of you guys are.
[82:09.80]Alright, let's see.
[82:10.30]Morse code.
[82:10.76]You ready?
[82:11.40]Somebody decipher it if you can.
[82:18.18]Okay, I can't do it fast enough.
[82:19.93]So, okay, here we go.
[82:20.81]Alright, I can do Morse code here.
[82:24.11]Morse code is going to begin right now.
[82:25.35]You ready?
[82:25.65]Let's see if some of you guys can do it.
[82:43.55]What'd I say?
[82:56.11]No.
[82:58.93]No.
[83:06.26]I did save our ship.
[83:09.60]S O S O U R S H I P Done.
[83:41.99]Alright, let's make the next thing.
[83:48.68]Oh, it's so sour.
[83:49.16]Look, sometimes it's Morse code.
[83:51.44]They don't teach it in school anymore.
[83:53.84]It's like cursive handwriting.
[83:55.66]I bet you half of you guys... I don't know how to do cursive.
[83:57.66]How many of you guys know how to do cursive handwriting?
[83:59.46]Sometimes you're going to fuck it up.
[84:00.24]You don't do it on a daily basis.
[84:01.90]So I misspell one letter.
[84:04.16]Whoops.
[84:04.98]I don't do Morse code on a daily basis.
[84:07.81]We all have like Twitter and iPhones.
[84:09.81]Nobody's writing cursive anymore.
[84:17.32]Alright.
[84:17.66]Titanium.
[84:23.59]They teach it, but we don't.
[84:24.45]Do they actually still teach Morse code?
[84:29.77]Oh, wait a minute.
[84:30.31]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[84:31.05]Okay, new equipment.
[84:33.98]I need standard glass, two glass, standard O2 tank.
[84:38.94]Compass.
[84:40.68]Copper wire and a wiring kit.
[84:43.96]No new tools.
[84:45.52]Sea Glide is battery, lubricant, copper, wire.
[84:47.55]Okay.
[84:48.65]Let's just start making shit.
[84:50.09]You know what I'm saying?
[84:51.97]So I want a... What do I need here?
[84:57.85]Let's go with equipment.
[85:00.59]I want a high capacity O2.
[85:02.40]We need a standard O2 tank.
[85:06.54]Wait, I already have one.
[85:07.60]But how... Fuck me.
[85:10.62]Can I like break that down?
[85:13.39]I have to, like, take it off.
[85:14.19]The reason why it's red, I thought I had to have, like, a separate one to make a new one.
[85:17.13]I don't, you know, just whatever.
[85:20.01]I'll throw the other one in the garbage can.
[85:22.63]Uh, glass.
[85:24.71]I need two quarts.
[85:25.77]Do I?
[85:28.41]Inventory.
[85:28.87]Actually, no, I think I'm okay.
[85:29.73]Oh, goddammit.
[85:33.04]Look at all this junk.
[85:35.96]Coral tube samples.
[85:37.24]Like, what the fuck am I gonna do?
[85:38.76]What's wrong with me?
[85:39.88]What's happening?
[85:42.23]Oh, shit!
[85:42.95]Oh, wait, I gotta... Quick, get a guy, get a guy, get a guy, get a guy.
[85:49.67]Gary!

[85:52.19]Where is one?
[85:53.43]Come here, come here, come here, come here.
[85:55.13]Bladder slug.
[85:57.26]Where's a bladder slug?

[86:25.37]Food?
[86:25.67]No, this is just food.
[86:29.93]Okay, please, God.
[86:34.06]Where?
[86:34.42]They're always right over here.
[86:35.86]I'm gonna die.
[86:43.89]Can I eat anything?
[86:45.83]Eat the seeds, eat the mushrooms.
[86:48.11]Eat something!
[86:49.43]Oh, shit!

[86:59.50]Okay, well, I'm back.
[87:07.98]I'm back.
[87:11.45]Does it even matter?
[87:12.27]I don't think that even matters.
[87:17.93]I don't think I even lost anything.
[87:20.39]Where's this putting me?
[87:24.11]Dying has no consequences, apparently, on regular standard mode.
[87:34.03]You used a health pack.
[87:34.81]Did that actually heal you?
[87:37.09]You lost experience points.
[87:48.34]right I gotta get rid of this titanium I have too much of it and I need to get rid of this stuff too I'm such a hoarder I can't ah alright I need glass what else what the hell do I need I need to get rid of this I can't even pick this up
[88:13.72]I have to go retrieve my ghost.
[88:16.24]Okay.

[88:28.92]I'm making the locker.
[88:30.44]Although I can't even use this because I can't... God damn it.
[88:38.90]I'm going to go throw this stuff in the water.
[88:43.26]It'll be here when I come back, right?
[88:50.57]Alright, yeah.
[88:50.95]There they go.

[89:33.97]That sucks.
[89:36.13]God damn it.
[89:37.35]I need one more quartz.
[89:38.65]Let's just go get it.
[89:47.23]Quartz 1.
[89:50.47]Find a random cave.
[89:57.44]That was a really fun waterslide.
[89:59.80]Creature egg!
[90:04.22]Is it hatching in my... Is it hatching inside me?
[90:10.94]No.
[90:11.94]That was just a random encounter.
[90:12.99]Okay.
[90:14.71]I'm gonna go down there, though, because I need quartz.
[90:18.39]I just need one quartz.
[90:21.25]There's got to be one down here somewhere.
[90:22.65]Come on, man.
[90:24.15]Right here.
[90:26.37]Okay, goodbye.
[90:30.25]Why do I always go at the top?
[90:32.01]I don't know.
[90:34.99]I don't know.
[90:35.35]I think I just do.
[90:43.52]And away we go.
[90:46.06]Glass.
[90:50.39]Second tank.
[90:53.19]There it is.
[90:53.61]High capacity O2 tank.
[90:55.21]Beautiful.
[90:59.00]Stick it on my back.
[91:01.40]Nice.
[91:01.70]Okay, cool.
[91:02.38]What is this, like 100?
[91:06.86]What's my currently equipped shit?
[91:10.69]Shit.
[91:16.52]How do I get to my equipped ship?
[91:18.84]Stupid idiot.
[91:20.24]You dumb idiot.
[91:21.12]It's over here.
[91:22.26]Right here.
[91:24.76]Stupid dumb idiot head.
[91:28.54]Okay, so I have... Wow, that's a lot more.
[91:30.46]Nice.
[91:30.66]That's 135.
[91:30.94]So this stuff is going to go... What else can I make?
[91:42.28]Let me just see if I have anything else.
[91:43.64]Electronics.
[91:44.70]Let's make a copper wire.
[91:49.67]Let's make a battery.
[91:51.43]I'm going to use up all the resources I have.
[91:52.97]Because it's just too much dumb shit is being taken up.
[91:57.97]Scanner is fine.
[92:01.21]Let's just bring this shit over here.
[92:02.99]Let's make whatever we can make with all this junk.
[92:08.77]Because I need to consolidate.
[92:13.60]Okay.
[92:14.26]Equipment.
[92:14.90]Tools.
[92:16.50]Can make a first aid kit.
[92:17.46]Let's make a first aid kit.
[92:22.53]Um... Tools... Let's make a flare.
[92:31.65]Deploy it.
[92:32.25]Alright.
[92:32.77]Sea Glide.
[92:33.94]Converts torque into thrust underwater via a propeller.
[92:41.54]Um... No, I didn't pick up my stupid replica- dumb lightsaber replica.
[92:50.50]Inventory's fucking full.
[92:52.42]You dumbass.
[92:55.18]Put this creature egg away.
[93:04.49]There's so many of these.
[93:09.79]What am I thinking?
[93:11.29]I'm trying to consolidate.
[93:14.52]I'm throwing these floaters outside.
[93:20.96]Okay, now please let me make my fun sea glider.
[93:23.68]Okay, I'm just going to make a locker.
[93:40.02]I feel like everyone tells me that they're not that great, but I'm going to use it.
[93:44.44]Okay, sea glide.
[93:47.44]So how do I use this?
[93:48.26]How do I use the... I think I can just, like, use it, right?
[93:50.72]Let's put the hair dryer... Let's put on the waterproof locker.
[93:55.54]And the sea glide is its own thing.
[93:59.73]Put that off for a second.
[94:00.77]So let me... I'm gonna, like, store.
[94:02.61]I'm gonna throw these in the trash.
[94:05.81]All this, like, coral samples.
[94:08.11]The dumb mushrooms.
[94:10.86]Okay, now we're gonna store the titanium.
[94:15.06]Store the... Store the... Whatever this is.
[94:17.14]The Astroglide.
[94:17.96]Whatever the hell the hell the hell the hell.
[94:20.58]I can't even fucking talk.
[94:23.64]Um... So this is all getting thrown away.
[94:26.72]We're gonna deploy this.
[94:32.08]And I think I'm ready to go.
[94:33.66]Good.
[94:36.81]Going down the bottom this time.
[94:39.91]So let's put the... Locker down here.
[94:45.46]Okay.
[94:47.02]Edit locker name.
[94:50.64]This is just junk.
[94:52.99]Open the storage.
[94:53.77]And here we go.
[94:54.57]So let's put the flares.
[94:55.99]Some of the flares in here.
[94:57.55]The air pump.
[95:01.38]Fire extinguisher.
[95:02.22]I don't need it right now.
[95:05.06]Uh... I'm gonna eat the food brick.
[95:09.58]And that's good for now.
[95:11.33]Okay?
[95:11.87]Cool.
[95:12.83]Now throw this shit in the trash.
[95:14.43]Drop, drop, drop.
[95:15.41]Drop, drop.
[95:16.15]Who cares?
[95:17.85]I don't understand what's happening right now.
[95:21.78]I just got hurt by these things.
[95:25.02]Why is this thing floating away?
[95:27.22]Excuse me.
[95:28.96]Don't touch that.
[95:31.42]Why is this thing floating?
[95:33.22]Stay down.
[95:34.06]God damn it!
[95:37.12]What?
[95:37.28]I just hurt him.
[95:39.04]I just stuck it to his head.
[95:40.32]I just put a weight on him.
[95:53.73]Is it like a deterrent?
[95:55.65]I think that's a deterrent.
[95:57.87]What else floated away?
[95:59.57]Did my lamp float away?
[96:01.71]What is this?
[96:04.30]Acid?
[96:04.60]No.
[96:04.76]Okay, I understand what those things are for.
[96:06.30]At least I saved my own life.
[96:11.94]Time to move.
[96:15.36]So now... I want to do radiation suits.
[96:20.33]So we need two lead and two mesh.
[96:22.23]And then a rebreather.
[96:26.61]So we need some lead and fiber mesh.
[96:30.71]Lead and fiber.
[96:34.08]This thing is still freaking out, isn't it?
[96:38.92]Let me get my inventory back here.
[96:44.53]And scanner.
[96:45.37]Alright, so how does this thing work?
[96:55.55]I guess that's how it works.
[96:58.79]Alright, cool.
[97:01.91]That's really cool, actually.
[97:03.15]Good thing I have that.
[97:05.29]Actually, thanks for the tip, guys.
[97:06.53]Because that thing is great.
[97:09.29]Alright.
[97:09.83]I need a radiation suit.
[97:12.70]What's the, uh... Save it right here.
[97:16.32]How do you get a... Radiation suit is fiber mesh and lead.
[97:19.48]Where do you get the fiber mesh?
[97:22.36]That is up here, right?
[97:23.76]Fiber mesh is creep vines.
[97:25.18]So let's go get creep vines.
[97:28.78]Those were this way, right?
[97:36.35]What am I looking at here?
[97:37.74]Oh, it's like a map.
[97:40.42]Creepvine samples.
[97:42.36]Watch out for the alien monster that's right here.
[97:51.02]Okay.
[97:55.42]So let's get a couple more of these.
[97:57.50]And then I need lead.
[97:58.47]So where am I going to find lead?
[98:02.11]30 seconds.
[98:05.92]How do I turn the flashlight on with this thing?
[98:07.34]The lead's just gonna be somewhere.
[98:22.25]How do I turn the flashlight on with this thing?
[98:25.80]It's too dark down here.
[98:27.74]Oh, there we go.
[98:35.44]Alright, look at the lead.
[98:38.90]As soon as I find it, I will let you know.
[98:40.69]Hey, excuse me.
[98:42.27]Come here.
[98:43.71]Ladderfish.
[98:47.71]Lead.
[98:50.61]I want to go this way.
[98:54.74]This is pretty fun, though.
[98:56.62]I am enjoying this.
[98:57.42]I need to find, like, a cave system, I think.
[99:03.82]Sandstone...
[99:06.24]Just wait, hold on.
[99:08.50]No, I'm not picking up the metal salvage.
[99:10.00]It's too much space.
[99:10.72]I don't like being down here in the dark, though.
[99:17.94]Lead?
[99:19.57]No.
[99:19.75]I'm trying to remember exactly the way that I was before for the lead.
[99:28.95]I don't remember.
[99:29.53]Let's just go over there this way.
[99:35.94]I'm bound to run into it.
[99:39.24]Am I just going to run into it if I keep going over here?
[99:45.67]This looks like a sandstone spot.
[99:53.19]Looks pretty sandy over here.
[99:58.24]I've never scanned these, really.
[100:02.70]Acid mushroom.
[100:03.34]Let's go get oxygen.
[100:16.70]Sand.
[100:19.57]Looking for sandstone.
[100:21.29]Looking for something to break.
[100:23.21]This looks sandy.
[100:26.47]Sand?
[100:28.47]No, that's quartz.
[100:31.91]Sand?
[100:36.58]It's titanium.
[100:37.46]Come on.
[100:41.99]Where's the sand?
[100:44.17]Copper.
[100:47.70]It's too dark in here.
[100:48.82]I wanna turn this stupid, like, Obi-Wan Kenobi map off.
[100:55.84]This is all lime.
[101:03.47]Gotta go deeper.
[101:12.03]My inventory is full.
[101:12.99]I'm gonna run out of oxygen, too.
[101:15.69]What's that?
[101:16.69]Oh, that's a limestone.
[101:18.60]I gotta get out of here.
[101:19.24]I'm gonna run out of oxygen.
[101:20.28]I'm gonna get stuck somewhere, I know it.
[101:25.48]Uh, inventory is full, so that means... Let's throw this on the ground.
[101:33.14]I'm okay with... I'm okay.
[101:40.17]So we're gonna go over here.
[101:47.42]Sandstone?
[101:48.96]Yes.
[101:50.73]Gold.
[101:53.67]Interesting.
[101:54.11]That's not what I wanted, though.
[101:55.19]37.
[102:03.93]Those creep vines rot away.
[102:05.69]God damn it.
[102:12.78]Straight down again.
[102:20.73]What is that?
[102:21.43]Something's glowing down there.
[102:25.85]Got purple mushrooms?
[102:27.86]What are these?
[102:30.14]Nothing.
[102:31.24]Really?
[102:31.46]Oh, shit.
[102:33.00]Okay, I can't do this yet.
[102:34.14]I gotta go back.
[102:47.02]I cannot go in here at the moment.
[102:48.52]I need a better oxygen tank.
[102:52.28]17?
[102:52.32]What's this?
[102:55.40]Interesting.
[102:56.06]Seamoth Fragment.
[103:00.50]New boat or something?
[103:03.41]Ooh.
[103:04.85]I can make a... I can make like a submarine.
[103:09.87]Here is the abandoned PDA.
[103:12.61]And the data downloads.
[103:13.45]Integrating new PDA data.
[103:16.38]Anything else in here?
[103:20.52]No, it doesn't seem like it.
[103:21.66]I can actually see, though.
[103:26.52]That's good.
[103:30.34]Alright.
[103:32.26]Need sandstone still.
[103:36.77]I would love some sandstone.
[103:38.33]If you could give some to me.
[103:43.35]That looks like what I'm looking for.
[103:46.65]Well, that's limestone.
[103:48.19]Fuck!
[103:51.91]New enemies.
[103:57.27]New enemy.
[103:59.95]These things look hostile.
[104:01.25]Yes, they are.
[104:01.75]They're hostile, I think.
[104:03.29]Um... Ah!
[104:09.86]What the hell, man?
[104:12.68]Just... Swim away with this thing.
[104:21.66]He can't catch me if I'm going that fast, right?
[104:24.18]Yeah, okay.
[104:28.26]I just need sandstone!
[104:31.36]So I can make my radiation suit.
[104:33.32]So I can go check out the ship.
[104:45.50]Put that away.
[104:48.38]Sandstone.
[104:54.47]Sandstone.
[104:56.33]There we go.
[104:57.05]Lead.
[104:57.81]I think I can make it now.
[105:01.37]What's that?
[105:02.99]Salt deposit.
[105:04.37]Nice.
[105:06.87]What's this?
[105:09.46]Nothing.
[105:10.92]I believe I have enough.
[105:15.34]But I am going to get some more salt.
[105:17.42]No, I'm not.
[105:18.82]I'm going to throw this away.
[105:22.50]I want more salt.
[105:24.98]Chat deposit.
[105:26.54]I've got to pick up some of that chat deposit.
[105:29.62]They're so salty.
[105:32.34]No, I don't want any quartz.
[105:35.66]Alright, who do you guys think has the saltiest chat?
[105:37.78]Do you think it's my chat?
[105:41.40]Who has like a super salty chat?
[105:46.91]No, I don't want that.
[105:54.00]I need two?
[105:54.80]Yeah, I have two.
[105:59.06]Ooh, sea glide fragment.
[106:00.36]Wait, I already have a sea glide, don't I?
[106:01.68]Is this like sea glide part two?
[106:05.91]No.
[106:15.38]30 seconds.
[106:15.82]That's just limestone.
[106:16.86]Alright, I'm gonna go back.
[106:22.83]Let's go back and... Let me make sure I can actually do this so I'm not wasting time.
[106:25.95]Alright, so who do you... We all have our... Our ideas of who has the saltiest chat, but who has the dumbest chat?
[106:40.46]I don't think it's mine.
[106:44.59]My chat is a pretty highly intelligent chat, I would say.
[106:50.36]Remember we did the thing where we talked about how everybody here, we all went over for like 12 hours our careers.
[106:57.25]And it turned out that like 40% of you were doctors and 25% of you had at least a PhD.
[107:06.24]And when I say at least a PhD, a lot of you guys, a lot of you uneducated people don't understand this.
[107:12.32]When you get a PhD, you prestige, and then you get another degree plus one.
[107:17.60]So PhD, and then you keep going, sets you back to an associate's degree plus one, bachelor's degree plus one, and then you get a master's.
[107:26.87]There's a lot of people in here that I've talked to that are master's +2.
[107:29.95]So you prestige to two times.
[107:31.37]That's actually pretty interesting that there's that many intelligent people here.
[107:37.01]I, for one, I have only prestiged once.
[107:40.01]So I am a associates plus one.
[107:46.36]So let me... Me smart.
[107:54.06]What was I doing?
[107:56.30]Yeah, this.
[107:57.56]So I need, okay, fiber... What was the suit?
[108:02.32]Radiation suit.
[108:03.91]Fiber mesh and lead times two.
[108:06.05]How much lead do I have?
[108:13.39]Shut up.
[108:14.77]I have one lead in my inventory, I think, right?
[108:18.58]And then fiber mesh.
[108:19.44]Yeah, I got enough.
[108:28.64]Throw the rotted creep vines away?
[108:30.17]No, I'm going to turn the creep vines into fiber.
[108:39.94]scan yourself you might be one of the locker no I think there's one of the safe deposit box up here whatever it is eat the vines I'm not gonna eat those you're not gonna bait me into throwing away the thing I just picked up I do need water though so that's a good idea let's pick I know I picked up a bladderfish let's grab a couple more if I can
[109:06.84]While we speed through this.
[109:08.74]Oh, there's one right there.
[109:09.76]Come here.
[109:12.08]I lost him.
[109:13.10]No, I didn't.
[109:14.32]I was going a little too fast.
[109:18.60]My inventory is full.
[109:20.39]God damn it.
[109:21.13]I'm going to throw two titanium away.
[109:23.51]I don't need them.
[109:25.07]I need these.
[109:29.25]One more.
[109:29.53]Alright.
[109:33.31]Now let's go back to the boat.
[109:39.83]Making purified water.
[109:41.17]It's really worth it?
[109:41.91]I thought people were saying not to make that.
[109:44.74]Was I lied to?
[109:45.46]Okay, let's put this down.
[109:50.92]Fabricator.
[109:51.86]Alright.
[109:52.22]Resources.
[109:52.96]Basic materials.
[109:53.94]Fiber mesh.
[110:00.44]And what else do I need?
[110:01.80]Personal equipment.
[110:03.94]I need two fiber mesh.
[110:09.90]I know about the water.
[110:10.76]I'm alright.
[110:11.70]I'm blinking red right now.
[110:13.38]I'm not dead yet.
[110:16.92]I need two lead.
[110:18.60]Let's make the water first.
[110:20.90]Water.
[110:23.25]Why would you want to drink bleach?
[110:29.87]You're going to drink bleach.
[110:35.78]Something tells me you shouldn't do that.
[110:46.01]Drink bleach.
[110:46.87]Eat Tide Pods.
[110:48.67]That's the only time I'm going to allow people to make that joke now.
[110:51.85]Because that is what I'm doing.
[110:56.61]Whatever.
[110:57.37]I'll figure that out some other time.
[110:59.85]Give me my other lead deposit.
[111:03.03]Which is right there.
[111:06.98]And let's make our suit.
[111:11.56]Radiation suit.
[111:17.86]Takes a long time.
[111:21.40]So, equip suit, radiation helmet, radiation suit, high capacity, swimmy trunks, and radiation gloves.
[111:30.83]Alright, I think I'm ready to go check out the ship.
[111:36.81]Or maybe I'm not, and if I'm not, then whatever.
[111:39.93]At least I tried.
[111:40.55]Let's just craft down the other resources I have.
[111:45.67]Let's make some more glass.
[111:50.75]Electronics, copper wire.
[111:52.07]I am going to bring food and water.
[111:55.73]That's probably a smart idea.
[111:59.47]Okay.
[112:00.35]Let's go to here.
[112:02.19]I'm going to bring flares.
[112:07.84]Bring the health kits.
[112:11.04]I needed the silver for something too.
[112:12.84]What did I need the silver for?
[112:17.30]I needed silver for something here.
[112:20.64]Air bladder?
[112:23.04]Oh.
[112:26.20]Okay.
[112:27.43]Habitat builder.
[112:31.01]Equipment.
[112:31.47]What was the thing I needed silver for?
[112:33.87]No, okay, I already did it.
[112:34.73]High capacity tank.
[112:35.47]Just remembering from before.
[112:36.83]Alright.
[112:39.69]Store.
[112:41.50]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[112:46.28]Jesus, Jeremiah.
[112:47.10]Just go.
[112:47.92]Alright.
[112:50.96]Like Jerma, my god.
[112:52.30]Go!
[112:52.66]Now we're gonna throw this on the ground.
[112:58.28]Let's go get some food.
[113:04.24]We're gonna go just fish collecting.
[113:08.56]Oh my god.
[113:09.40]Go, dude!
[113:10.26]Jesus Christ!
[113:12.06]This is so fucking boring.
[113:14.41]Go!
[113:16.13]This guy's still here.
[113:23.70]Shit.
[113:24.90]Why is he still here?
[113:28.56]Why is this persisting forever?
[113:30.74]This is just, you know, can you know when you go through in like a briar patch?
[113:34.30]No, not a briar patch.
[113:35.10]I don't know what these things are called.
[113:36.02]I'm going to explain them and you guys can figure it out because I don't know what the hell they are.
[113:40.70]When you go outside and you go in the woods and you walk around and you go through a bush or something like that and you get those tiny prickly sticky things that get stuck all over you and you have to peel them off individually.
[113:51.98]What are those things called?
[113:53.97]You guys know exactly what I'm talking about.
[113:57.03]Some of you do.
[114:01.99]What are those things?
[114:05.39]Birds.
[114:08.65]I hate those things.
[114:11.51]Okay, I need some fish.
[114:12.95]I need to cook some food.
[114:14.10]Pick up, you need water.
[114:17.66]Come here.
[114:19.18]You little shit.
[114:20.34]No, I don't want that.
[114:24.57]Uh, can you cook boomerangs?
[114:27.77]We'll find out.
[114:31.39]Mm-hmm.
[114:33.62]Cannot pick that up.
[114:35.64]What about you?
[114:36.04]What about a peeper?
[114:36.66]Come here.
[114:40.48]Uh-huh.
[114:41.72]Is it Gary's mod over here?
[114:44.40]Somebody just gave $50?
[114:45.22]I think it might have been Gary.
[114:50.68]Hold on.
[114:52.26]Let me just pick up a couple more of these and we will see who that was.
[114:59.15]What is that?
[114:59.53]I don't know.
[115:03.09]Only 15 seconds.
[115:05.77]Asha!
[115:06.53]Asha108.
[115:06.83]Thank you for the $50, Asha.
[115:07.70]Asha.
[115:14.52]Hey, Jerma.
[115:14.96]Long time no donate.
[115:17.04]Been a hard week.
[115:17.82]Work sucks.
[115:18.64]And I just got dumped.
[115:20.35]Jesus.
[115:22.93]Hoping 2018 goes more smoothly than this.
[115:25.95]And that this is just a fluke.
[115:28.39]Also, I'm looking forward to Demon Lord Zaraxos killing all the memes in the afterlife after they've already been dead.
[115:35.40]Yes, tomorrow is going to be... First of all, we'll touch upon the memes.
[115:41.34]Tomorrow is the meme funeral.
[115:43.75]Don't expect anything.
[115:45.07]I'm going to say a few words, and we're going to have a nice little piece.
[115:49.89]I'll make sure that an obituary is in all of your local newspapers.
[115:56.61]And I'm pretty sure how many people are here right now?
[115:59.21]There are... I'm pretty much going to take a snapshot of this chat.
[116:04.61]And it's just 2,500 people here.
[116:06.06]So I'm assuming that in like probably 30 different countries and like, you know, hundreds of potential different towns and cities, it's going to cost probably $700 million for me to do this, but there will be obituaries for every single one of these memes.
[116:18.98]It's going to take up almost the whole paper.
[116:21.41]The whole first five pages of the newspaper on all of your local newspapers will be this.
[116:28.40]It's not that big of a deal because nobody reads newspapers anyways.
[116:31.66]Just a publicity stunt for me to get more views.
[116:34.36]You know, like, holy shit, what happened?
[116:36.76]BuzzFeed's gonna make an article about it.
[116:38.88]Streamer goes crazy and makes... rents out his local newspaper for a week?
[116:44.64]It's just a stunt to get views.
[116:50.12]Anyways...
[116:52.01]Thank you for the $50, Asher.
[116:54.33]Hopefully 2018 goes a little more smoothly and more in your favor like you're hoping.
[117:00.43]New year, new you.
[117:02.65]If you just got out of a relationship, today's a brand new year.
[117:08.39]You know what?
[117:09.61]I'm going to make a reference here.
[117:12.47]There are plenty, plenty of fish in the sea.
[117:16.85]You understand?
[117:18.72]Some of them are small, some of them are big.
[117:21.38]Some of them... Some of them are very mean.
[117:27.25]Some of them will dump you.
[117:29.35]But, as you can see, there's plenty of good fish, too.
[117:31.77]Look, see?
[117:32.41]There's this fish right here.
[117:34.91]That's very good.
[117:36.67]Potential, like, boyfriend or girlfriend material.
[117:40.35]What the hell is this?
[117:41.31]What are you doing?
[117:43.13]Wait, hey, that's my ex!
[117:44.22]She's stealing my shit!
[117:45.86]That's mine!
[117:46.50]That's my TV!
[117:49.32]Give me that!
[117:52.42]Alright, let me get out of here.
[118:00.83]Boomerang, aka the rebound.
[118:05.65]Thank you, Asher, though, for the $50.
[118:06.59]Best of luck to you.
[118:10.01]I need to get rid of this stuff.
[118:11.29]I just picked up... Okay, Gary's Fish is... Yeah, get out of here, you stalker.
[118:23.63]Just make enough to get to 100% and then go.
[118:28.13]Oh my god, Jerma.
[118:29.43]Just go!
[118:30.73]Okay, what do you think would happen to you?
[118:38.04]I'm gonna go, this is real life.
[118:40.14]Let's go over real life.
[118:41.62]If you were watching another streamer that was playing this game and you wrote over and over again, just fucking go, what do you think is gonna happen to you?
[118:51.75]You're going to get banned from that chatroom.
[118:53.65]You're going to get timed out.
[118:55.09]You're going to get banned.
[118:56.76]I don't do that here.
[118:59.78]If you, like, said just go to somebody playing Subnautica, they'd probably be like, how dare you?
[119:05.64]And you're going to get, like, permabanned.
[119:11.08]I am allowing total criticism.
[119:17.63]I just like... I gotta stop... You know what I need on my desk?
[119:21.47]For real.
[119:23.03]I need... I need like a foam pad that sits right on my desk so I can just slam my hands down on it whenever I want and not get injured.
[119:32.68]I need to get like a big jello pad that just sits right here so I can mash my hands down.
[119:39.54]Just... Just go.
[119:42.72]Just go.
[119:44.32]It's so to the point.
[119:45.34]It's so mean.
[119:48.43]You understand how mean that is?
[119:52.47]Let's do... There we go.
[119:54.25]Alright, I'm ready.
[119:58.86]I only have 64 health.
[120:01.24]But I'm not going to use it.
[120:02.26]I'm ready to go down into the sea.
[120:06.70]I would like, honestly, I would rather... I don't have any room.
[120:10.70]Shit.
[120:10.92]We're going to store those in the locker down here.
[120:14.72]Like, it's so mean.
[120:16.66]Because it's so, like I said, so to the point.
[120:20.60]It's not like you guys are saying, like, hey dude, I'm kind of getting a little bored.
[120:24.24]Is there anything else we can see in the game?
[120:26.85]I'm just curious.
[120:27.91]You're going to be ready soon?
[120:29.57]Yeah, I think you're okay.
[120:31.05]No, like, just go.
[120:32.35]I am so fed up with you, and I'm so impatient with this.
[120:37.41]Like, just fucking go.
[120:39.93]It's so much worse.
[120:47.97]Just getting a little... Where's the flashlight?
[120:51.35]Alright, here we go.
[120:54.78]On our way.
[120:56.58]Into the ship.
[121:02.92]How do I get in?
[121:09.65]Battery?
[121:10.23]Oh, fuck.
[121:11.03]I don't have any batteries.
[121:14.87]Let's check.
[121:15.29]Wait, let me save this because I feel like something terrible is going to happen.
[121:19.82]Jeremy, your insecurity is setting in.
[121:22.68]No, I don't... My insecurities are based around factual information, okay?
[121:30.00]I'm not ins... $100 from Nifty.
[121:36.92]Thank you, Nifty underscore, for the $100.
[121:38.34]And they say, they say, just go.
[121:44.05]Thank you, Nifty, for the $100 to tell me to go.
[121:45.99]I'm going.
[121:48.66]I'm currently going.
[121:51.52]That was a $100 go.
[121:52.78]Is this thing alive?
[121:59.57]Big money.
[122:01.47]Big money Jerma.
[122:02.47]Does this thing not have enough fucking battery power?
[122:09.46]All jokes aside though, Nifty, that's a lot of money.
[122:11.46]Thank you, dude.
[122:13.51]Thank you so much for your incredibly large contribution to the stream.
[122:19.60]Come on.

[122:23.76]I have to do something in 24 hours.

[123:52.30]This looks like a hole I can get in.
[123:54.22]Is that like a bitmap image?
[123:57.10]Can I get in through here?
[124:00.23]No, I can't.

[125:52.43]Here we are.
[125:54.45]So.

[125:57.45]This is really, really well designed.
[126:03.45]This is cool.
[126:04.77]I like this.
[126:08.19]There is a box on the ground here.
[126:11.70]Oh, by the way, um, I forgot.
[126:16.54]I, uh... I may have turned the music off.
[126:24.54]What the hell are you?
[126:25.22]So there is no music.
[126:27.35]Alright, watch out.
[126:28.87]These headcrabs.
[126:29.83]There's headcrabs here.
[126:36.51]How many hits does it take to kill one?
[126:40.23]Oh, he's dead.
[126:42.80]Something tells me I kind of need a gun.
[126:48.92]Cave crawler.
[126:49.62]I want to open this.
[126:54.24]Ah!
[126:54.54]God damn it.
[126:55.20]Don't do that.

[126:59.18]Tag team.
[126:59.90]Alright.
[127:01.08]What'd I get?
[127:01.44]A battery?
[127:02.00]That's a lot of shit here.
[127:04.63]I'm stuck in the box.
[127:08.33]I need a gun.
[127:10.60]Why am I stuck in the box, still?
[127:17.72]This whole thing's gonna crash down, isn't it?
[127:23.18]I feel like I have health pack.
[127:33.48]What is that?
[127:34.26]No, nothing in here?
[127:37.16]I'm gonna hold the scanner out just in case.
[127:39.03]There's something here to scan.
[127:41.81]Well, that looked like there was something there.
[127:44.73]Desk.
[127:47.47]Why would I want to scan a desk?
[127:50.76]Okay, but I guess I can make this now.
[127:54.52]Nice.
[127:54.84]I can make my own computer desk.
[128:01.69]Um... I don't think I can... Can I go in there?
[128:04.05]No.
[128:04.11]Let's wrap around.
[128:12.18]Self-scan.
[128:13.00]No.
[128:13.74]I hear another one of those bugs.
[128:17.75]Get over here.
[128:19.01]You little coward.
[128:20.49]You're making this... When do you get the machine gun?
[128:28.48]When do I unlock the AK-47?
[128:29.50]Because I want it.
[128:32.02]Okay.
[128:38.72]Um... Fire extinguisher.
[128:41.47]Yep.
[128:44.23]Good thing I brought that.
[128:47.93]I didn't bring it.
[128:48.67]I don't have one.
[128:52.91]It's in the box.
[128:55.17]Great.
[129:00.13]Every game isn't Castle Griffinstein?
[129:01.88]What are you talking about?
[129:05.12]Yes, it is.

[129:39.06]Wire cutters.
[129:39.80]Just don't step on any electricity.
[129:41.26]You're going to be fine.
[129:47.42]Just find something to scan so I can have stuff to build.
[129:52.32]Floodlight.
[129:54.32]I can learn how to make it.
[129:55.10]There's no reason to even fight these things.
[130:04.05]Another box.
[130:05.31]Anything else I can scan?
[130:09.73]I can't move.
[130:10.81]Move out of the way.
[130:12.69]Supply crate.
[130:13.77]First aid.
[130:15.91]Nice.
[130:19.51]There's no reason to even fight them.
[130:20.67]Just move.
[130:24.26]The digestive tracts.
[130:28.60]Well, of course they do.
[130:30.44]These things are biting me.
[130:35.35]I'm getting bit by monsters.
[130:38.23]They're going to have some of my DNA in their bloodstream.
[130:40.16]That's just going to happen.
[130:43.56]Anything else I can scan before I get out of here?
[130:47.14]Plank?
[130:49.66]No, I can't do anything here.
[130:51.33]Wait, I can go down here.
[130:52.03]I can go on the rollercoaster.
[130:55.91]What's that?
[130:56.35]Can I get this?
[130:58.89]No, I can't walk forward.
[131:00.09]Alright, we're going to go on the Thunder Mountain.
[131:08.10]Disney World.
[131:11.41]I can avoid that.
[131:14.01]Jesus.
[131:14.99]Oh, Jesus.
[131:18.37]I'm alright.
[131:26.60]He's dead.
[131:30.08]Ugh.
[131:35.10]Only two of these dudes up here?
[131:42.49]You went all the way over here to die?
[131:44.29]What am I getting hit by then?
[131:46.63]Are you serious?
[131:47.33]Alright, almost to the point where I probably need to turn around.
[131:57.66]If I take one stage light on the head here, I'm going to have to go back.
[132:05.34]Nice.
[132:06.60]Perfect.
[132:07.82]Okay, now I have one.
[132:10.51]So let's go ahead and put this down here and replace the flashlight.
[132:19.03]We can stay.
[132:27.70]Very cool.
[132:28.66]I can go in this room now.
[132:30.30]Should I even go in here yet?
[132:36.74]Airlocks.
[132:40.59]Um... Cargo bay administration.
[132:47.03]Uh... Ooh, a PDA.
[132:53.89]Propulsion cannon?
[132:56.37]Alright, I need one more of these and I can make a cannon.
[133:01.95]I'm gonna take this off.
[133:03.53]The... I don't need the flying saucer anymore.
[133:08.81]I do need...
[133:11.37]Drink some... No, don't drop it on the ground.
[133:16.97]Drink the water.
[133:19.57]And eat... I need one that's... Minus H2O.
[133:22.59]That sucks.
[133:25.34]I need... What do I need?
[133:26.68]What do I need?
[133:27.38]What do I need?
[133:27.82]Flashlight.
[133:28.26]Alright, I'm gonna go to... I'm gonna say Cargo Hold is probably better.
[133:40.20]But there is a box right here.
[133:41.28]Is it a battery?
[133:47.56]Should I put out some of these fires?
[133:49.28]Is there stuff behind them or something?
[133:50.82]Somebody was saying in the chat that there's stuff on the fires or behind the fires.
[134:01.21]Nothing.
[134:02.85]Shit.
[134:06.34]Uh, let's put this out.
[134:09.52]I gotta conserve this.
[134:13.26]Oh!
[134:13.64]How do I put myself out?
[134:16.82]What the hell?
[134:17.54]How do I put myself out?
[134:18.46]Alright.

[135:13.43]What about the... Okay, chairs.
[135:20.76]Why would I want to make all these things?
[135:24.18]What about the... Swivel chair?
[135:31.44]Interesting.
[135:33.56]And then there's a data terminal.
[135:35.80]I got another data.
[135:38.32]More data.
[135:42.87]I'm addicted.
[135:45.91]It's final.
[135:47.61]I'm addicted.
[135:51.33]You got me game.
[135:52.15]You do.
[135:52.39]Another data.
[135:57.98]Another data.
[136:02.68]What else is in here?
[136:03.74]I'm looking for, I wanna find the other combustor array.
[136:11.12]Nothing else in here?
[136:12.00]Come on, really?
[136:14.77]No.
[136:16.51]There's gotta be more shit I can do in here.
[136:19.93]Fuck.
[136:22.87]Nothing else?
[136:25.47]Nothing in there.
[136:29.64]Climb over the boxes, can you?
[136:38.24]I just- I'm like bouncing off of it.
[136:45.85]That- wha- the- I- okay, I wish the game would please stop.
[136:49.51]I understand the ship's breaking, but... Just parkour.
[136:53.70]I mean, the game kind of goes down to like 20 frames a second in here.
[137:01.76]There's another battery.
[137:09.25]Please don't run into a giant monster in here.
[137:13.40]Lots of batteries.
[137:16.64]And the door to the boss.
[137:22.80]Hmm.
[137:24.20]Repair it?
[137:29.61]I don't think I can get in here.
[137:32.21]No getting in here!
[137:32.91]Can I smash it?
[137:42.07]Huh.
[137:42.15]I'm gonna have to check the data- I'm gonna have to check the databank.
[137:50.06]So- Oh, wait a minute!
[137:51.24]Four!
[137:59.99]Goddammit, it's in my databank.
[138:11.07]Um, advanced theories, no.
[138:14.27]Equipment, no.
[138:17.87]Data downloads.
[138:20.03]Codes and clues.
[138:21.34]Notes to self.
[138:23.82]Okay.
[138:25.74]1-4-5-4.
[138:31.24]Thank you!
[138:33.50]Open.
[138:35.25]And we've got ourselves a treasure room.
[138:39.53]There's probably so many things in here There's probably so many things in this room hold on wait Got into the cargo room tons of fucking toys tons of collectibles tons of consumables.
[139:02.18]I can't wait.
[139:02.66]Oh
[139:11.97]My God.
[139:20.38]There's so many things to pick up.
[139:27.64]Supply crates.
[139:31.65]Tons of things, tons of cargo boxes.
[139:38.53]Unbelievable.
[139:41.59]What's that?
[139:41.99]Nice!
[139:42.21]Are you serious?
[140:06.61]We'll begin with a spin Traveling in the world of my creation What we'll see will define Explanation Wow!
[140:23.54]Charlie, there's chocolate over here too!
[140:27.86]What about down here?
[140:31.73]I can't even contain myself!
[140:33.77]This is where the fun part comes in, where Grandpa picks up the fucking chocolate!
[140:38.29]Where is it?
[141:02.82]Alright, we're good.
[141:09.31]Grandpa's fine, don't worry.
[141:13.35]Here comes the fun part!
[141:14.45]I only have 5% of this left.
[141:21.60]I can't dick around right now.
[141:26.56]Fuck.
[141:29.76]How am I gonna get out of here, though?
[141:30.70]That's the one question.
[141:36.14]I think I'm locked in here.
[141:38.28]Pretty much.
[141:39.79]I don't even know where I was going.
[141:44.73]I'm in the core.
[141:46.97]Pick up Cyclops engine efficiency.
[141:51.31]New blueprint.
[141:53.05]Maximum tolerable level.
[141:57.33]Oh, Jesus.
[141:57.95]I gotta get out of here.
[141:59.29]Is there anything else over here?
[142:02.09]Wait, there's another fire extinguisher?
[142:03.19]Where?
[142:05.64]Where is it?
[142:06.18]Right there!
[142:06.54]Nice!
[142:07.34]Oh, wow!
[142:08.04]Saved me!
[142:09.82]Scan?
[142:15.13]I don't think I should go swimming.
[142:16.17]That's probably a bad idea.
[142:21.49]Maximum tolerable levels of radiation.
[142:25.97]Hmm.
[142:28.57]Scan the breach.
[142:30.55]Another database entry.
[142:34.87]Uh...
[142:42.20]Get out.
[142:42.58]Quick, quick, quick.
[142:43.22]Get out.
[142:44.66]Right?
[142:44.84]This is big radiation water.
[142:46.04]Bad.
[142:47.57]Get out of there.
[142:48.01]Alright, I'm fine.
[142:52.61]Another piece of data?
[142:54.39]No, nothing.
[142:55.93]How am I doing?
[142:59.59]Bacteria levels?
[143:01.35]I'm still fine, though.
[143:04.36]I think I got the one thing I need from this room.
[143:09.22]Uh, fuel at 100%.
[143:11.31]Swap that, please.
[143:15.97]Maybe I can take this down?
[143:17.59]Maybe there's a box back here?
[143:22.51]Why would they have this whole thing covered up, right?
[143:25.29]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[143:27.49]Into the water.
[143:28.13]God damn it.
[143:28.59]No, there's no reason to do that.
[143:29.67]There's nothing over here.
[143:35.04]I can repair it?
[143:36.02]Can I?
[143:43.22]repair the breach?
[143:51.95]Should I not be in the water?
[143:53.07]I don't know.
[143:54.27]In the water.
[143:56.01]Fuck me.
[143:57.18]Is that a breach?
[144:01.44]I see a breach right here.
[144:09.80]Okay.
[144:10.96]There's a fucking bug on me.
[144:12.46]How do I get it off?
[144:13.10]Get it off me!
[144:13.60]I didn't know this place had leeches.
[144:19.59]Oh my god, I'm going to die in like ten seconds.
[144:23.15]Well, that's it for first aid.
[144:32.32]Asshole.
[144:34.27]I gotta repair all the breaches, man.
[144:35.77]I can't just not do them.
[144:39.25]The whole point of coming down here is probably to fix all this.
[144:51.77]Nine breaches I have to repair.
[144:53.67]Oh my lord.
[144:57.75]That's a lot of breaches.
[144:58.69]Breach repaired.
[144:59.11]Further breaches detected.
[145:02.58]Are they all in the same room?
[145:04.16]Or are they in different rooms?
[145:11.62]Are the breaches only on those?
[145:17.42]They're all in the room?
[145:18.14]Alright, I'm going to save it here.
[145:19.02]I'm going to get my knife ready.
[145:24.98]To knife the dude.
[145:26.30]I'm dead.
[145:27.92]If I take any more hits, I'm going to be dead.
[145:33.64]Where is the piranha that was in this little office down here?
[145:36.94]Where's the piranha's office?
[145:38.02]There's a breach right there.
[145:41.12]Where is he?
[145:51.01]There's one stupid enemy.
[145:56.11]Containment breach repaired.
[145:59.75]Further breaches detected.
[146:02.06]Get out of my office.
[146:04.88]Is he no longer here?
[146:08.18]Where did you go, man?
[146:12.88]Just spit out the Sparks.
[146:14.02]Easy to see.
[146:14.66]Easy to find.
[146:16.16]Easy to repair.
[146:16.82]I got scared of my own... There he is.
[146:18.06]Yep.
[146:18.28]My office now.
[146:32.52]I want to scan it, though.
[146:34.80]Breaches?
[146:35.61]Are these things actually called breaches?
[146:37.89]No, they're called bleeders.
[146:41.39]Now they're all over here.
[146:42.09]I need to scan them, though.
[146:45.97]Shit, there's a lot of them now.
[146:48.19]I just need to get the scanner on them.
[146:49.35]I need to know what they're like and what they eat and what their ecosystem is and how they breed and how they interact.
[146:54.14]Got it.
[146:59.44]Fuck, I'm thirsty.
[147:02.32]It's funny.
[147:02.60]I actually mean that in... I'm just realizing now that I actually am thirsty in the game, too.
[147:05.62]I'm thirsty in real life.
[147:06.58]That's why I said that.
[147:09.54]Okay.
[147:10.58]I'm good.
[147:14.68]Only two more after this.
[147:16.94]There's one here.
[147:22.73]Come on, get it.
[147:27.79]One more.
[147:28.89]Where is it?
[147:37.18]Oh, my O2.
[147:40.94]Good.
[147:44.08]Oh!
[147:46.79]Alright.
[147:47.33]Radiation level has been depleted.
[147:53.09]Good.
[147:54.55]Congratulations.
[147:58.05]What's wrong with my guy?
[148:00.83]Alright.
[148:01.19]I need water.
[148:01.81]I don't have any.
[148:07.28]So what the hell is a boy to do?
[148:09.10]I think I have to go back.
[148:10.16]No longer need the radiation suit, I guess.
[148:26.38]Pull the flashlight back out.
[148:30.65]There's water in the boxes.
[148:33.81]Really.
[148:36.94]You can find some in crates.
[148:38.56]I will keep an eye out.
[148:43.91]What about this door?
[148:44.47]Can this door be opened?
[148:48.87]Dude, I really would like it if... Damaged.
[148:51.41]It would be great if instead of batteries in every box, there was water.
[149:01.80]This is a new room.
[149:04.06]Come on.
[149:04.34]Somebody has to have a leftover bottle of apple juice or something lying around.
[149:07.28]I have so much more data.
[149:14.16]Come on.
[149:15.52]Pick up Seamoth Depth Module.
[149:19.44]I'm gonna die.
[149:20.12]I gotta die.
[149:20.76]I gotta get out of here.
[149:21.86]Seamoth Fragment.
[149:23.42]I've learned so much.
[149:24.50]I can't die.
[149:25.24]I need one more piece.
[149:30.91]Now I can make a Seamoth.
[149:35.35]New blueprint.
[149:36.15]Seamoth.
[149:38.01]Nice.
[149:38.41]That's cool.
[149:39.51]Okay, how do I not die?
[149:40.87]How do I get out of here?
[149:42.05]I gotta go.
[149:46.34]None of these open.
[149:50.64]Oh boy.
[149:51.30]Oh no.
[149:51.85]How do I get water?
[149:52.99]I need water now.
[149:56.35]Just go home.
[149:57.07]I'm going home.
[149:59.83]How do I get out?
[150:01.13]How do I get out of the game?
[150:02.65]No, not get out of the game.
[150:03.47]How do I get up?
[150:04.63]Can I get up?
[150:11.23]What is this?
[150:14.70]Oh, I forgot.
[150:15.90]This is from when I was doing the stupid Your Imagination joke.
[150:18.84]Okay, go, go, go.
[150:19.60]Out, out, out.
[150:22.02]This is... Wait!
[150:25.75]Water?
[150:26.01]Oh, yes.
[150:27.43]Come on.
[150:28.25]Oh, everything's fine.
[150:29.59]Okay, I can stay here for a little longer now.
[150:31.97]That was so lucky.
[150:55.40]What did I do that for?
[150:56.00]I thought there was a door here.
[150:57.06]I thought there was a door.
[150:59.91]I'm out.
[151:01.57]Uh, and for those reasons, I'm out.
[151:09.25]Somebody want to get, like, 30% equity in my company?
[151:12.83]For, like, $140,000?
[151:13.17]Sorry, I can just make another one.
[151:31.82]Mm-hmm.
[151:32.52]Okay.
[151:34.42]Back to the ship.
[151:36.71]This stuff over there?
[151:38.37]Nah, we gotta get out.
[151:42.31]I'm running out of water.
[151:43.55]I've got no more health kits.
[151:50.02]Okay.
[151:50.98]Back to the ship.
[151:52.00]I have a ton of new blueprints.
[151:53.20]A ton of new scans.
[151:57.82]I've been to the administrator's office.
[151:59.78]Got everything I need from there.
[152:03.29]Time to leave.
[152:10.27]The thing told me to get wire cutters too, for some reason.
[152:12.76]What does that do for me?
[152:24.89]Okay, is this like real life?
[152:26.73]If I jump in here, am I gonna die?
[152:28.85]Or is this not like real life?
[152:34.78]I'm so scared that I'm going to jump in here and it's going to be over.
[152:38.02]Where's my... Swimmy?
[152:42.08]What happened to my Swimmy?
[152:48.51]Oh, there it is.
[152:51.05]Okay, I'm going to save it here because... If this doesn't... Alright, it's not like real life.
[152:58.84]If it was real life, I would have disintegrated.
[153:00.34]So, that's good.
[153:01.56]Let's go.
[153:03.16]Back to the ship.
[153:04.68]Wait, I didn't even look over here, did I?
[153:06.04]Let me see what's down here.
[153:08.74]Oh, I have like a minute or two.
[153:12.13]Anything on the ground level?
[153:14.21]In the water?
[153:16.89]What is this?
[153:19.05]No, nothing?
[153:23.81]Nothing, nothing, nothing.
[153:27.41]Alright, back to the ship.
[153:28.45]Let's go.
[153:39.16]Mm-hmm.
[153:42.83]Okay.
[153:44.57]Well, that was fun.
[153:55.34]Monster?
[153:55.72]Another monster?
[153:56.90]No, it's just one of those stupid idiot things.
[154:01.46]No, it's just one of those dumb idiots.
[154:12.19]Wait, what do you mean I ran into a scary thing?
[154:15.55]When?
[154:16.79]I just collected some stuff.
[154:17.81]That's all I did.
[154:20.55]I'm gonna run out of power for this thing.
[154:21.80]That's not good.
[154:26.14]Swim faster.
[154:27.10]Why do I have to swim faster?
[154:28.28]There's nothing here.
[154:36.66]I missed the gun.
[154:39.84]Oh no, a huge monster!
[154:42.22]I'm not scared.
[154:47.73]I missed a gun.
[154:50.85]Well, there's plenty of time for- Oh, it's done.
[154:54.15]I need exchange power source.
[154:58.94]Oh, battery.
[155:00.80]Hold on.
[155:01.08]Cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel.
[155:03.50]Cancel.
[155:04.36]Cancel.
[155:05.40]Cancel!
[155:11.10]I cut that too close every single time.
[155:13.40]Okay, power source.
[155:17.42]So I want to select a battery.
[155:21.16]Yes.
[155:23.84]Please put the battery in.
[155:27.02]Unload battery.
[155:31.06]And then load up a battery.
[155:37.47]Did that do it?
[155:38.21]What's happening here?
[155:39.93]Battery.
[155:43.88]Select.
[155:45.38]Okay.
[155:46.30]That was strange for some reason.
[155:50.16]Like, the green... That has no charge.
[155:52.50]Well, unload it.
[155:53.16]Why is it still here?
[155:53.96]Throw it in the trash.
[155:57.12]Like, just throw all your batteries in the trash when they're done.
[156:00.88]Don't do that.
[156:07.49]You put the empty one back in.
[156:08.99]Well, don't act like you've never done that before, okay?
[156:12.15]All of us know.
[156:13.83]Everybody that has a TV, do you own a television?
[156:16.76]Do you own a speaker set?
[156:18.74]Do you own a Walkman?
[156:19.58]Do you have a CD player?
[156:21.30]Yeah, you've put those batteries in.
[156:25.41]one time in your whole life and guess what if TV stops the TV changer stops working you're gonna take out old ones put in new ones take out switch old ones and you're gonna lose track of all the batteries you've ever put in that thing I think I've bought batteries twice in my life I just keep exchanging them into other devices so I have a box full of batteries that might have zero charge and I put them in oh no these don't work and I put them back in the draw
[156:56.47]What's... Get in the boat!
[157:05.73]He's clapping for me.
[157:06.69]Did you hear that?
[157:07.15]He was so happy that I got in.
[157:10.79]Alright.
[157:12.25]Let's just go ahead and see what we're doing here.
[157:16.64]Lots of stuff.
[157:22.14]Talk shit, get hit.
[157:23.56]Fabricator.
[157:25.59]I can't make anything?
[157:28.33]Why?
[157:31.83]Didn't I get a bunch of new blueprints?
[157:37.79]Why is the whole world off?
[157:42.53]Resources.
[157:43.53]Electronics.
[157:45.21]Battery.
[157:45.69]Power cell.
[157:46.76]Computer chip.
[157:48.74]Wiring kit.
[157:52.64]How do I make my new boat?
[158:01.46]Didn't I just get, like, a blueprint for a new boat?
[158:06.47]This is Avery Quinn of Trading Ship Sunbeam.
[158:08.87]Aurora, do you read?
[158:10.07]Over.
[158:12.37]Nothing but vacuum.
[158:13.87]These Altera ships, they run low on engine grease and an SOS.
[158:17.91]You want help?

[162:40.85]Let's do that.
[162:41.51]Let's get a habitat builder.
[162:45.25]Okay.
[162:45.89]What else am I throwing on the ground?
[162:48.54]These are at like 0%.
[162:52.14]So why would I even hold on to them?
[162:56.40]No, these are going to kill my H2O.
[162:58.94]All of them will.
[163:03.21]Next up is vehicle bay.
[163:04.23]Then you can become a deep sea Monster Hunter.
[163:05.81]Okay, I don't need the radiation suit anymore.
[163:12.55]Is there a reason to take it off?
[163:15.99]Is there anything bad about keeping it on?
[163:19.50]Alright, habitat.
[163:21.22]Let me make a habitat builder.
[163:24.60]Fabricate habitat compartments and appliances from raw materials.
[163:27.86]I need a computer chip, wiring kit, computer chip, and a battery.
[163:35.75]Wiring kit is two silver.

[163:41.77]So I need copper.
[163:43.59]I think I have copper.
[163:44.29]I need a wiring kit.
[163:46.26]So let's go get silver.
[163:47.64]But first, let me just get some food.
[163:49.20]I need to make some water.

[165:22.87]Bladderfish, there's one.
[165:31.53]Another one there.
[165:33.41]There's quite a few of you over this way.
[165:41.62]I'm going to make at least four or five waters if it's possible.
[165:45.82]Although I kind of need to just go back now and do this.
[165:48.46]Okay, there's one here.
[165:49.26]There's one.
[165:51.28]One crossed over this way, right here.

[165:59.45]That's four.
[166:04.57]Good.
[166:10.74]Inside the boat.
[166:16.06]Make five waters.
[166:17.08]I'm going to make as many as I can.
[166:26.90]Get coral tube samples and make bleach.
[166:34.31]Play more.
[166:35.59]Oh, hold on.
[166:36.05]This is important.
[166:36.51]I'm going to talk to you guys about what's going on over the next week.
[166:39.21]May I have your attention, please?
[166:45.25]This week, we're not doing any light gun stuff this week.
[166:49.60]Or Dreamcast.
[166:51.16]So this coming Tuesday, like next week, Tuesday is going to be light gun stream.
[166:57.62]Number one.
[166:59.28]We might even do light gun week.
[167:00.64]Because there's going to be a lot of them.
[167:04.34]I'm going to have a ton of light gun games.
[167:07.46]Ranging from odd, weird shit to stuff that you may have seen before.
[167:12.87]So that should be fun.
[167:14.61]The week or two after that, we're going to start Dreamcast.
[167:18.64]There's going to be a tower of Dreamcast games.
[167:22.90]And... Also, there's other stuff that might be in between there.
[167:28.76]But I have a good solution to... Hold on, I'm going to die.
[167:32.02]Just hold that thought.
[167:33.12]Let me drink some water first.
[167:38.25]Alright.
[167:38.89]Now I can actually do that again.
[167:41.43]Alright, what about the Gravitron?
[167:47.75]This is stupid.
[167:51.83]Alright, I can either make a portal Winston.

[168:03.24]Wheatley.
[168:03.92]Wheatley was his name.
[168:04.80]I can make Wheatley a Ghostbuster trap.
[168:09.09]Um...
[168:10.83]That's a cryptocurrency joke.
[168:12.13]No one's going to get that.
[168:14.19]I'm going to just say it in case somebody cares.
[168:16.08]Stellar lumens and a plunger.
[168:21.62]Okay.
[168:25.56]Weakie.
[168:26.62]Mr. Weakie.
[168:31.87]Store all this other trash.
[168:34.57]Get this trash out of here.
[168:39.45]Yeah, because it was a cryptocurrency joke.
[168:42.53]Oh, fucking hilarious.
[168:44.83]Like, you know, what you should say is, fuck you, is what you should say to me for that.
[168:49.74]I don't deserve your attention because I made that joke.

[168:56.22]What do I want to do?
[169:01.78]What do I want to do?
[169:03.82]I want to make a wiring kit.
[169:05.65]I need silver ore.
[169:09.58]So let's just go get silver ore.
[169:11.76]That's going to be my goal here.
[169:14.46]Put on the... Didn't I just load it up with a battery?
[169:19.18]What do I do with it?
[169:21.72]There.
[169:23.12]Alright.
[169:23.68]Good.

[169:41.96]No, it's at 77%.
[169:42.38]Alright, let's go.
[169:45.29]Check the radio.
[169:46.01]I want to just get this moving.
[169:48.73]I want to get the ball rolling here.
[169:54.87]I need silver.
[169:58.85]So let's go very fast this way.
[170:05.04]Why am I keeping all the rotten food?
[170:07.54]What?
[170:07.76]I don't plan on keeping it.
[170:08.86]I just want to have it just in case something horrible happens and I need to throw it.
[170:15.79]Silver.
[170:16.25]Where do I get the silver?
[170:22.69]He picked the coral back up.
[170:23.91]I thought everybody told me that I needed coral.
[170:25.79]I needed coral samples to make something.
[170:31.50]Which one is it?
[170:32.06]Do I need it or do I don't need it?
[170:41.56]Table coral.
[170:45.36]I need it.
[170:47.55]I don't need it.
[170:49.33]I don't need it.
[170:50.93]I definitely don't need it.
[170:53.69]I don't need it.
[170:56.49]I need it.
[170:58.81]What is that thing?
[171:00.99]Oh, it's a hostel.
[171:07.76]I can't go down here yet.
[171:15.23]We need to make bleach.
[171:16.09]Alright, let's get some silver.
[171:22.14]Just run away from this.
[171:26.62]Oh, you guys fuck off.
[171:27.82]These guys are annoying.
[171:28.68]He's still behind me.
[171:34.93]Probably.

[171:36.57]I need... I don't even... What the fuck am I doing here?
[171:40.75]What am I fucking doing here?
[171:43.50]I need silver.
[171:53.22]I'm in the right spot, right?
[171:54.78]To find silver.
[171:58.25]Salt.
[171:59.43]Special equipment is required.
[172:00.61]Okay, I can't do anything with that.
[172:04.47]Okay, got it.
[172:05.91]What about on the backs of these guys too, right?
[172:13.15]No, I want full oxygen.
[172:14.27]Okay, these guys have shit all over them.
[172:21.03]Let's go steal their stuff on their backs.
[172:26.68]I'm getting shot by somebody.
[172:29.90]That's weird.
[172:32.36]These guys have random things on them.
[172:37.10]Salt deposit.
[172:39.40]You got any more weird things to break off?
[172:44.74]Scan.
[172:46.12]You.
[172:48.98]Cool.

[173:01.63]This game's fun.
[173:10.26]Hopper.
[173:15.23]We got silver in here?
[173:19.76]Silver.
[173:21.98]I knew I could trust you.
[173:23.06]I knew you were gonna have the things that I need.
[173:25.04]I think I have the silver that I need now.
[173:29.68]That's copper again.
[173:40.55]Alright, I think I only have, I only need two.
[173:45.55]So yeah, it's just two.
[173:46.71]And then what was I doing?
[173:47.75]I was gonna make a haggard habitat.
[173:51.57]So I need a computer chip and a battery.
[173:53.44]So a computer chip is table coral sample, gold and copper wire.
[174:03.60]Table coral is that boring dumb shit that some scientist wants to play with.
[174:11.53]Fucking boring ass dumb idiot scientist.
[174:13.99]Would you go to MIT?
[174:17.85]I have a plus one associates, dude.
[174:21.57]You think you're smarter than me?
[174:27.33]Duh.
[174:29.03]That's not it.
[174:29.67]Table coral.
[174:34.81]You think you're better than me?
[174:38.89]More wreckage?
[174:40.25]No.
[174:43.81]Ooh, what's in here?
[174:47.54]It says biohazard on it, but nuclear waste.
[174:55.66]Why would I want to make this?
[175:00.61]Yeah, just put together some nuclear waste.
[175:04.11]Give it to somebody.
[175:06.59]Just, like, re-gift it.
[175:07.61]Alright, I need table coral.
[175:16.79]Gold, that's what I need.
[175:23.98]This is good.
[175:25.32]This is actually, like, I'm having a blast.
[175:27.72]I'm having a great time right now.
[175:37.09]Everyone's having a great time.
[175:41.65]Just eat it?
[175:42.13]No.
[175:43.29]No.
[175:47.25]It's sponsored.
[175:50.65]No.
[175:54.68]Woo!
[175:59.90]Sarcastic.
[176:01.52]I'm not being sarcastic.
[176:03.22]This is a fun game.
[176:04.20]I like this.
[176:04.96]I like this game.
[176:10.88]I need a table coral, and I forget what the hell it looks like, but I should scan that.
[176:20.67]I just like collecting all the names.
[176:23.27]And all the places.
[176:26.87]I like knowing about it.
[176:30.11]It adds to my knowledge as a person.
[176:38.28]Alright, tiger plant.
[176:40.20]Is the thing that's been shooting at me.
[176:44.40]It's just a dumb life form.
[176:47.02]I believe this is table coral over here.
[176:50.15]Nope.
[176:52.03]Might get some more gold out of this.
[176:53.61]Nope.
[176:54.91]Just copper.
[176:55.51]I don't really want copper, I don't think.
[177:00.71]Scans everything and never reads.
[177:02.69]Yeah, but that's not my job.
[177:05.71]That's the job of some idiot scientist.
[177:09.62]I'm the guy that gets to do the fun stuff.
[177:11.16]I get to go around and scrape stuff and punch fish, pee in the water and blame it on somebody else.
[177:20.72]I don't want to do any research.
[177:23.78]That's for like the dumb idiot moron scientists.
[177:32.36]I walk around and hit stuff with my knife and then pick up and move.
[177:37.33]It takes so much more brain power to do that.
[177:40.71]What a moron.
[177:49.56]No, that's not what I need, is it?
[177:51.06]I need the, what is the table coral?
[177:54.49]Coral tube, table coral.
[178:00.15]I feel like I'm missing it here.
[178:05.81]It's in the beginning.
[178:19.30]Excuse me, I'm an idiot scientist.
[178:25.43]Wait, sandstone?
[178:27.29]No.
[178:28.41]What do you have?
[178:29.61]I'll take the copper, fine.
[178:38.46]Ah, coral shell.
[178:39.62]Did I go buy it?
[178:42.74]I don't even know what it looks like.
[178:43.64]What does it look like?
[178:48.26]I went by, I know, but what does it look like?
[178:49.86]I don't know what it looks like.
[178:50.76]Is it shaped like a table?
[179:01.74]Purple, it's the purple plates.
[179:04.00]Thank you.
[179:05.38]Purple plate.
[179:07.26]See, I can understand that.
[179:08.86]I'm not one of these dumb brainless pile of shit scientists.
[179:13.26]What do you think, they're changing the world?
[179:17.22]Make it easier for me.
[179:18.38]Purple plate.
[179:19.06]Fucking imbecile scientists.
[179:25.76]It's the underwater tables.
[179:29.02]Oh, excuse me.
[179:30.10]Somebody told... I can't touch it.
[179:40.42]Somebody said it was purple.
[179:42.98]The person that said it was purple plates has to be.
[179:47.07]and stupid idiot scientist because take a look these are clearly green with pink polka dot sprinkles it's so funny how like easily it's so easy just to say
[180:10.94]Like, you can call anybody an idiot.
[180:13.10]It doesn't even matter.
[180:14.46]That's like the stupid social media dogshit world we live in.
[180:17.64]Think about that.
[180:18.22]Like, oh, that guy?
[180:19.56]Oh, that guy's an idiot.
[180:20.88]I'm going to tell him he's an idiot.
[180:22.85]No, I don't believe that guy.
[180:23.93]That guy's an idiot.
[180:27.27]That guy said something?
[180:28.27]No, don't listen to him.
[180:29.71]He's a fucking idiot.
[180:34.12]You know, do you want to do a little science experiment for yourselves, guys?
[180:38.58]Go to Twitter.
[180:40.03]And you know how you can search any term on Twitter?
[180:43.29]Go ahead and go to the search bar and just type in idiot.
[180:47.06]And you tell me what the over under there is on how many, just somebody claiming that so-and-so is an idiot.
[180:55.14]Go look.
[180:58.90]It's so easy to call somebody an idiot.
[181:00.56]Alright, watch you do that and it's all talking about me.
[181:13.23]Half of them are just about my stream.
[181:17.67]It was just me.
[181:22.13]Idiot.
[181:23.40]I have too many of these gold coins.
[181:30.80]This is a distress signal, but hold on.
[181:32.02]I need to craft some stuff first.
[181:35.68]I did all this to make copper wiring.
[181:39.08]So, wiring kit.
[181:43.71]I need... What else did I need?
[181:49.15]Habitat builder.
[181:50.03]Where is it?

[191:59.86]Cook the food, get to full health.
[192:07.00]So this should last a little while at least, right?
[192:14.35]Hello, YouTube.
[192:16.13]I might be making too many.
[192:20.11]Is this too much food to bring on an expedition?
[192:25.12]Is there such things as overeating in this game?
[192:29.88]What do you mean it's already rotten?
[192:36.82]It's not going to be already rotten.

[193:15.39]In the locker down here.
[193:18.35]And then I'm going to go.
[193:26.70]I need to make like four more lockers.
[193:32.79]I'm going to make two more lockers or something.
[193:35.99]I swore.
[193:37.29]No, that was 30 minutes.
[193:38.17]That was at least 30 minutes.
[193:47.48]Not even 15.

[195:56.25]Right?
[195:56.47]Okay.
[196:04.02]Use the habitat builder to make a base.
[196:05.88]I want the vehicle bay first.
[196:09.45]Or should I build a base?
[196:10.45]What do you guys think?
[196:11.03]Should I go to the... Where can I get the last piece of the vehicle bay?
[196:16.11]Is that in that... Where I was before?
[196:19.23]In this giant town over here?
[196:23.68]Build a base.
[196:24.50]Base.

[198:58.13]huh so that there's nothing here I discovered it early that's alright well alright fine I already did that life pod signal life pod 17 life pod 3.
[199:35.92]Sometimes there isn't always stuff that's that's kind of cool.
[199:38.56]I like that.
[199:43.95]I Like I was not guaranteed you're gonna get something It really scratches that it should when I just scratch scratch tickets all day.
[199:50.49]I

[199:55.60]Just buy like ten $20 scratch tickets and sit there for like four hours.
[200:03.25]Spend $2,000 a day on scratch tickets.
[200:11.12]It's guaranteed that you looted this one already too.
[200:23.86]I already got this one too.
[200:30.51]No, I don't scratch scratch tickets.
[200:35.23]I eat them.
[200:37.29]To get their sustenance.
[200:38.99]Alright, this is lifeblood 3.
[200:43.15]Have we been in here already?
[200:46.96]Yes, yes we have.
[200:50.28]Ay yi yi.
[200:53.73]Okay, well let's take these off the list, because what's the fucking point?
[201:00.34]So you're telling me that I was here, I went inside this ship, they then called me and said, hey, please come rescue us at the ship, and I went back and they're not there and they were gone and I already were there.
[201:14.53]Is it one of those situations where I'm the murderer and I'm getting memories back from when I killed everybody?
[201:20.65]Like one of those horror thriller video games.
[201:22.71]Is this like Silent Hill?
[201:25.40]I killed everybody and I'm like going back and hearing my own memories.
[201:27.80]There's a fish prank calling.
[201:37.93]It was an automated message.
[201:41.11]Do I have a bad cell phone signal and I just got the message now?
[201:45.78]He sent that like four hours ago and I just got it now.
[201:49.68]Use that excuse.
[201:51.22]By the way, great excuse.
[201:52.24]I love it.
[201:54.90]Dude, what the fuck is going on, man?
[201:56.74]I like fucking texted you like earlier today.
[201:59.64]I must have been in a dead zone.
[202:01.87]You can still use that.
[202:05.03]I must have been in a dead zone is a bar none, straight up argument over no fault on either party.
[202:16.25]You can still use that.
[202:18.99]That absolves you from all, all wrongdoing.
[202:22.57]If you were late, if somebody, you know, you met somebody's birthday party you, like, didn't go to, and they wanted to invite you, and you saw it, just make sure you don't turn on read receipts.
[202:32.61]Because then you're fucked.
[202:35.11]Oh, yeah, I must have been in a dead zone.
[202:36.79]Oh, really?
[202:37.11]Because it said that you read it.
[202:39.41]Oh, uh, I don't know, man.
[202:41.81]I don't know.
[202:42.23]Something must be glitched.
[202:44.11]You gotta be careful.
[202:50.62]My iPod's six.
[202:51.42]Radiation.
[202:51.84]I'm just draining the battery.
[202:54.38]I gotta survive.
[202:55.86]Let me just hold the flashlight against the wall.
[202:58.18]Wait, let me replace the fucking battery.
[203:00.90]How do I replace the battery?
[203:03.44]Is there a way just to do it right now?
[203:06.14]Reload, okay.
[203:07.10]Unload that battery.
[203:20.05]And put in this one.
[203:20.83]100%.
[203:21.19]Easy.
[203:22.33]Alright, distress signal 6.
[203:31.22]Where is it?
[203:35.38]Where's distress pod 6?
[203:40.94]What?
[203:41.72]Corrupted?
[203:42.31]Approximate transmission origin recorded to data bank.
[203:46.23]Approximate transmission origin recorded to data bank.
[203:53.05]What the hell, man?
[203:55.59]Okay, Lifepod 6.
[203:57.08]Where's Lifepod 6?
[203:58.10]There it is.
[204:00.26]Okay, a distress signal has been received from Lifepod 6, but the attached coordinates were corrupted.
[204:06.02]Last available photographic data has been downloaded and analyzed.
[204:11.30]Crew requested assistance navigating radiation, sunk to 100 meters, located in an area with dense red grass near a number of natural arches and rock stacks.
[204:24.60]Transmission origin approximately 400 meters west-northwest of Lifepod 4's last known location.
[204:32.91]I don't know what Lifepod 4 even is.
[204:34.31]I can't do this yet.
[204:36.81]Is there any more phone calls?
[204:38.45]No.
[204:42.25]I have to pee.
[204:50.53]Save the game.
[204:51.07]I gotta pee.
[204:52.47]I'll be right back.
[204:54.45]Give me like two minutes.
[204:56.09]More than that.
[204:56.79]It might be a big one.
[205:01.74]Big break.
[205:02.72]Big break.
[208:52.98]There is no life I know than a world of pure imagination.
[208:59.09]Take a look and you'll see inspiration.
[209:07.43]If you want to view.
[209:09.71]I can do that.
[209:11.61]Sign me up.

[210:01.47]He used to go Seacrest out.
[210:05.04]What a loser.
[210:12.84]That's... You know, he's probably like a really nice guy.
[210:17.37]It's in the databank.

[211:06.77]Out.
[211:08.05]Elbertson.
[211:09.29]Just go play.
[211:10.29]Damn it.
[211:27.13]I'm trying.
[211:27.91]I can't.
[211:28.63]He's in perpetual agony for the rest of his life.
[211:31.67]Alright, let's build the base.
[211:40.47]What do I need?
[211:41.07]I need titanium and a lot of it.
[211:45.98]Titanium and lots of it.
[211:47.72]I got some in here.
[211:48.62]I got one, two, three, four, five, six.
[211:54.31]And so how much does it take to build the wall?
[211:57.27]Foundation.
[211:57.91]I need two lead.
[211:59.63]Alright, I compartment, L compartment, T comp... Okay, I can make these.
[212:04.13]Let's make an X component.
[212:07.58]Let's put the shaving unit down here.
[212:12.50]Alright, let's do it.
[212:15.34]So, X component.
[212:21.83]Do I have to connect it to here or can it be anywhere?
[212:28.24]I think, well, let's put it like over here.
[212:29.80]Why not?
[212:30.12]Right?
[212:30.28]Like right here?
[212:35.36]You don't need fun.
[212:40.28]Does it have to be connected to the boat?
[212:47.79]You're supposed to put it far away.
[212:49.91]Okay.
[212:51.48]Well, I don't... I need a foundation, so... Wait, I... I can build... I can make the foundation.
[212:56.66]Alright, let's go far away.
[213:00.98]I'm gonna say, let's do, like, let's get a nice little house over here.
[213:05.96]I kinda want it near... Like, how about, like, here?
[213:10.38]I'm gonna... I wanna have, like, a nice beach house overlooking the water.
[213:18.85]Alright, let's construct it here.
[213:22.57]What's the point of a base if it's right next to your main base?
[213:27.44]I don't know.
[213:28.00]I don't know.
[213:31.40]What do you want me to do?
[213:33.36]What do you want from me?
[213:38.25]Underwater beach house.
[213:41.21]You want me to build it down?
[213:42.27]Okay, I'm going to build it down here.
[213:43.67]This is what you're going to get.
[213:46.89]I'm brand new.
[213:47.76]I'm new to the game.
[213:48.94]This is my first house.
[213:50.34]Don't you know in Minecraft you build a random dirt house and you forget where it is and you never go back to it again?
[213:55.52]That's what's going to happen.
[213:56.72]Foundation is going right here.
[214:00.25]Construct it.
[214:04.53]What's wrong with it?
[214:06.59]Why do they have holes in it?
[214:07.64]Oh, fuck.
[214:18.11]I still need more lead.
[214:21.33]Can I just leave this here?
[214:24.94]Whatever, that's fine.
[214:25.86]So now let's do a wall.
[214:27.78]A window.
[214:31.92]Vertical connector.
[214:38.68]This is just a child playing with blocks.
[214:42.21]I put down a square and then I put this circle on top like this.
[214:50.24]That's nice.
[214:51.42]There's my house.
[214:52.60]Overlooking the water.
[214:58.06]X-piece.
[215:03.55]I don't understand.
[215:04.33]No, doesn't this need to be connected to something?
[215:10.97]That's not going to work.
[215:12.71]It needs to be connected to something.
[215:13.99]I need to make a multi-purpose room.
[215:18.66]No, we're not ready yet.
[215:26.83]I'm making a McDonald's Play Place.
[215:35.47]Where's the ball pit gonna go?
[215:37.23]What did this even do?
[215:38.11]Oh, great.
[215:40.57]Can I scan it now?
[215:45.77]Alright.
[216:01.33]I'm going to have a connector that goes this way.
[216:06.11]How do I flip it?
[216:06.75]There we go.
[216:16.95]Alright.
[216:18.37]There.
[216:20.02]Now we just got to come back.
[216:21.26]This is not...
[216:30.35]I need two... I need two lead.
[216:33.69]I'm just fucking around, guys.
[216:35.43]Come on, give me a break.
[216:37.77]You think that's actually gonna be the house that I use?
[216:39.93]It's just a... It's just a... Got ya.
[216:41.91]I don't even remember what that is.
[216:56.81]Just go.
[216:57.75]I need lead.
[217:05.60]We're gonna get some lead.
[217:08.44]Eggs?
[217:10.34]Gonna take a couple, why not.
[217:13.54]You wasted materials.
[217:14.54]Titanium drops off of everything.
[217:16.70]You can get it in a thousand places.
[217:19.68]I had the same excuse for Stardew Valley, but the town never got better.
[217:23.61]Listen, alright, I'm gonna give you a real insight.
[217:26.37]A real insight into the life of Jerma the streamer, okay?
[217:30.47]Look it.
[217:30.93]Let me show you something.
[217:35.00]If I was off stream... You know how fucking boring this stream is gonna be if I sit here and build a whole house for you guys?
[217:44.36]You want me to build a fucking actual house?
[217:47.46]I'm gonna lose a thousand people.
[217:54.00]No, what we do on the stream is we get bit by sharks.
[218:01.35]That's how you get the real views on Twitch.
[218:14.54]Why else would we be here?
[218:23.11]Alright, I'm gonna go this way.
[218:32.57]I've waited so long for this.
[218:38.26]There might be something in this box.
[218:43.83]Hold on.
[218:44.97]Uh, salt.
[218:45.91]That's not lead.
[218:47.29]Unfortunately.
[218:50.03]Oh, fuck off, mate.
[218:53.61]That was tight.
[218:54.25]No, just get it.
[219:00.85]If you don't get bit in one minute, then I'm leaving.
[219:05.22]My entirety of my stream, I have to get, like, eaten by the shark.
[219:10.47]I'm not even doing the content that I'm so defending.
[219:17.81]Yeah guys, we only do like fucking wacky, funny shit on this stream.
[219:22.79]Where do I get the sandstone again?
[219:30.92]God.
[219:37.72]We're so wacky here.
[219:41.03]Alright, by a show of hands, would you rather have a like wacky stream or would you rather have a build the base stream?
[219:47.93]Be honest.
[219:49.90]Wait a minute.
[219:52.64]Isn't this where the bean, like the pod is, the bean pod?
[219:56.54]Wasn't it like right here?
[219:57.36]This is like, isn't it like right down here?
[220:08.10]Wacky.
[220:10.11]Alright.
[220:10.85]Hold on a second.
[220:11.73]I'm curious.
[220:12.69]I want to see what the denomination of people here.
[220:15.52]Because there's like three different types of streams and YouTubers, right?
[220:18.82]There's like, I'm very serious.
[220:20.86]I play the game.
[220:21.92]There's wacky, funny, wacky.
[220:24.50]And there's like a combination of, well, hold on.
[220:29.36]No, this is not true.
[220:30.44]There's wacky, funny, wacky stream.
[220:32.66]There's serious gameplay stream.
[220:34.85]And then there's a, I was paid to play this game stream.
[220:37.41]Those are the three games and streams you see on Twitch.
[220:40.03]So what would you guys, let's do a straw poll and see what you guys would rather watch.
[220:45.20]Let's see.
[220:49.30]So let's see.
[220:50.34]Hmm.
[220:56.32]Serious.
[221:00.14]Serious game.
[221:02.22]Serious gameplay.
[221:05.40]Wacky stream.
[221:12.85]Fuck, this is supposed to be a serious poll and I already ruined it.
[221:17.59]There you go.
[221:19.67]Alright, right now, what do you feel?
[221:22.59]People in this chat, how do you feel?
[221:27.21]No, I'm taking off the make money.
[221:28.51]It was a joke and I knew everyone was gonna press it.
[221:31.83]Redo it, don't go to that one.
[221:33.63]We're doing another one.
[221:38.32]We're doing a new one, new poll.
[221:49.52]Okay, here we go.
[221:50.36]This is the real one.
[221:52.54]Dude, go here, go to this one.
[221:53.58]This is the actual poll.
[221:55.14]Here it is.
[221:56.38]Alright, what do you feel like today?
[222:04.86]Alright, here it is.
[222:05.59]Haha, new poll.
[222:10.81]It is a new poll because I'm an idiot.
[222:13.15]And I put on the like the stupid, the like shill one.
[222:20.56]Serious Build the Basestream is currently winning by a fairly large margin.
[222:30.51]There's no way you could build anything worth... What did you just say?
[222:34.57]There's no way you could... There's no way you could be anything but wacky.
[222:38.37]Don't kid yourself.
[222:39.11]That's not true.
[222:39.69]This is not something I see.
[222:47.80]I said something and that's for you to just do that.
[222:51.36]You have to crack the Morse code there.
[222:53.30]So we're building, we're seriously going to build it.
[222:55.15]We're going to do a serious build the fucking base stream.
[223:00.89]By almost 20%.
[223:01.75]Put the toilet upside down.
[223:11.26]You can do both.
[223:12.32]Just put the furniture upside down.
[223:14.56]Oh, alright.
[223:15.24]There's people have spoken.
[223:17.57]You guys have spoken we're gonna do a serious build the base stream right now starting now I'm gonna go get a bunch of titanium and a bunch of lead a bunch of glass Let's build the base for like four hours I just need a bunch of titanium
[223:46.36]And we'll go from there.
[223:47.76]It's going to be the best base you've ever seen.
[223:49.14]Alright, now watch.
[223:52.38]Now I'm going to drop 800 viewers.
[224:02.63]Something about that actually makes me laugh.
[224:05.27]Oh, gun!
[224:07.05]Gun!
[224:12.38]Cool.
[224:13.24]Cutter.
[224:18.73]That means no jokes.
[224:20.07]I'm not going to make any stupid like Willy Wonka references that are like 19% funny to begin with.
[224:28.61]I'm just going to seriously play Subnautica.
[224:31.02]We're going to build the base.
[224:33.68]Let's just get a bunch of titanium.
[224:37.80]We're going to go into a cave system.
[224:39.02]We're going to knock down a bunch of stuff.
[224:41.94]Come down here.
[224:43.64]Come with me.
[224:45.07]And we'll be...
[224:49.45]Is there a hole here anywhere?
[224:54.06]Stop.
[224:54.80]Don't even bring it up that I've lost 300 viewers already.
[224:58.16]Don't even bring it up.
[225:01.50]This is it.
[225:05.84]I can do it.
[225:08.73]Fuck you guys.
[225:09.85]I'm going to build a mobile bay fragment.
[225:12.47]I'm going to go build the mobile thing.
[225:14.41]And I'm going to fly around in this spaceship.
[225:24.09]Who cares?
[225:24.95]We're not building the base.
[225:26.39]Because guess what, guys?
[225:28.17]I don't even remember where it is!
[225:36.04]I can't even tell you where it is.
[225:37.63]I don't remember where I put the foundation down.
[225:42.77]We're gonna go see what it takes to build the underwater sea lab.
[225:50.97]Willy Wonka reference waiting room.
[225:53.36]Alright, what do I need to do?
[225:58.60]Mobile vehicle bay.
[226:00.36]Titanium ingot.
[226:02.92]Lubricant power.
[226:03.58]So how do I get a titanium ingot?
[226:06.88]Basic minerals.
[226:07.64]Titanium.
[226:09.52]There it is.
[226:09.78]I need 10 titanium.
[226:11.42]We need the titanium.
[226:12.12]I need to go break down the base that I was building.
[226:17.18]Creature eggs.
[226:20.01]Fucking kidding me?
[226:20.96]Decomposing fish.
[226:22.54]Fucking hell.
[226:23.02]I need more titanium anyways.
[226:31.00]Where's my... I don't even have any water.
[226:36.29]I really do like this game, though.
[226:37.57]This is a very fun, interesting game.
[226:39.75]I feel like there's a lot of things I haven't seen.
[226:41.98]Where's our wacky base building?
[226:43.30]No, I'd like that.
[226:44.24]Look.
[226:46.57]So there was 20, there was a 20% margin for that vote, but I didn't get a chance to vote.
[226:51.91]And one vote from me, you know, because I'm a newgrounds.com where like, if you, some people had like, their votes were worth like 500 votes.
[227:02.09]If you leveled up on the forums enough or something, whatever it was.
[227:05.09]So just imagine that I'm like a level 15 on newgrounds.com.
[227:08.65]So I have like 500 votes.
[227:12.65]So I voted for get the vehicle bay.
[227:16.35]And it was so close, we just barely got over there.
[227:19.67]Do I have a signal?
[227:26.65]I know, I'm carrying around rotten fish, I gotta go dump them.
[227:31.90]Yeah, I'm the super delegate.
[227:35.30]Now let me just, where's the titanium, where's the base that I built?
[227:40.24]Because we're gonna decompose that whole thing, wherever it is, I think it's over here, right?
[227:43.89]Because it went, ha ha, it's just so close.
[227:47.34]I need the titanium because I need the vehicle bay.
[227:52.42]Wasn't it right here?
[227:56.08]What the hell was that?
[227:58.16]Where is it?
[228:00.21]It's like right here somewhere.
[228:01.41]Remember?
[228:02.65]Does anyone remember?
[228:03.39]I don't remember.
[228:13.98]I wish it wasn't dark outside.
[228:15.36]Oh!
[228:21.20]funny bass joke haha cut it out I honestly don't know where the hell it is I need to drink fucking food hold on let's do this first time to get serious
[228:50.09]I need some of those.
[228:51.45]Oh my lord.
[228:52.15]Just give me... I'm gonna... Forget about everything else.
[228:55.69]I'm just going to pick up like 30 of the bladderfish.
[228:59.39]We're going on a bladderfish hunt.
[229:01.33]And we're only gonna pick them up.
[229:09.86]See, he thought that was funny.
[229:17.66]Perfect.
[229:18.02]There's like three here.
[229:22.95]What are you doing?
[229:23.61]What's going on?
[229:30.70]Fish joke.
[229:33.06]Hey, will you guys... Will you guys get off my back?
[229:37.82]Whatever happened to the rules?
[229:39.66]Protect the streamer.
[229:40.69]I mean, like, defend... Like, be nice to the streamer.
[229:43.75]What about those rules?
[229:55.73]Uh, okay.
[229:56.61]That should be enough.
[230:00.17]But reported for misrepresentation of the truth.
[230:05.61]That was a really long way to say asshole.
[230:11.09]Water.
[230:18.18]I think, you know what?
[230:19.96]Let's separate it into two streams, okay?
[230:22.88]So tonight is...
[230:26.13]What did we do tonight?
[230:27.45]Can you guys, like, give me an example of what we've done?
[230:31.90]I think the stream has been equal parts serious gameplay, equal parts sponsored.
[230:43.40]It's not.
[230:43.98]It's not.
[230:44.46]I can't say shit like that, because, like, people... That's not true.
[230:48.98]So, like, I gotta... Don't say that.
[230:54.74]Okay, I'm going to... What do I need?
[230:57.37]Bleach?
[230:59.63]Equal parts nothing.
[231:01.21]Let me literally do nothing.
[231:02.59]I've gone into the big, huge ship.
[231:04.67]I blew up the... We counted down the new year.
[231:06.35]Okay, I've got to get rid of these.
[231:20.76]Now I have to get to... There's a lot of shit to do here.
[231:28.99]I need more titanium.
[231:30.99]So I need to go into a cave system and start breaking stuff.
[231:37.69]This is a build the base stream.
[231:39.05]This is why we're here.
[231:42.56]Just relax.
[231:43.88]You'll get that at some point real soon.
[231:48.46]I need titanium though.
[231:54.01]Titanium?
[231:55.97]No, not one of you idiots.
[231:58.99]There's a lot of titanium in here.
[232:00.31]Just stop it.
[232:01.09]Explode, please.
[232:02.27]Don't even do this.
[232:03.99]Don't do this.
[232:06.63]Copper.
[232:09.77]Titanium.
[232:15.98]God damn it.
[232:18.14]I hate these things.
[232:22.51]You guys are the equivalent of bees.
[232:28.13]If a bee stings you, it dies.
[232:30.15]There's no reason for it.
[232:31.19]Just relax.
[232:35.94]I need to start saving face.
[232:37.34]What are you talking about?
[232:38.08]Any more of these outcrops?
[232:52.59]Is he talking about the fishes or is he talking about us?
[232:55.08]I'm talking about the fishes.
[233:02.80]Why would I be talking like that about you guys?
[233:08.86]You guys are great.
[233:09.66]What are you talking about?
[233:18.78]I need more.
[233:20.75]How many was it to build the, uh, the thing?
[233:23.17]Because I want to, like, either tonight or tomorrow, I do want to go down deep.
[233:32.95]Oh, no.
[233:33.67]No, no, no, no.
[233:34.85]No!
[233:35.47]No, I stopped paying attention.
[233:37.57]Oh!
[233:38.45]No, this is bad.
[233:39.31]This is bad!
[233:42.71]God damn it!
[233:43.97]I made it!
[233:47.49]Where am I?
[233:49.17]No.
[233:53.58]I made it.
[233:57.30]Do I have a battery?
[233:58.28]Put this battery in.
[234:00.42]Okay.
[234:02.71]We're fine.
[234:06.39]Need a little more titanium.
[234:14.05]Too much copper.
[234:14.67]I want titanium, not copper.
[234:17.77]Stop giving me things I don't want.
[234:20.41]Or I'm gonna fucking scream about it in a letter to your development office.
[234:26.81]What's with the drop rate on titanium?
[234:28.91]It should be way more.
[234:30.03]I don't like it.
[234:36.20]How much titanium do I have?
[234:38.22]How are we that fast?
[234:39.00]I don't understand.
[234:41.70]Alright, I needed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... I think I needed a few more.
[234:45.78]How much do I need?
[234:52.42]Titanium ingot is 10 titanium.
[235:00.78]Now, let me actually take a look.
[235:02.20]I think I can pick up some of these, right?
[235:07.16]And I don't salvage.
[235:07.98]This will give me... Did I just throw it on the ground?
[235:18.99]Stream cries on stream.
[235:23.19]What's wrong with that?
[235:26.78]Scrap metal?
[235:27.28]That's right.
[235:27.74]I keep forgetting.
[235:28.54]Why does this sound like that?
[235:41.23]It's like an ice cube.
[235:44.37]Alright, I need a titanium ingot.
[235:46.47]I need one more.
[235:47.99]There's a bunch of that shit down there.
[235:53.47]Somebody just wrote, such a loser.
[235:57.53]God damn it.
[235:59.11]Don't, I hope you don't think of me like that.
[236:01.11]How do I change your opinion that way?
[236:04.35]Is it money?
[236:04.87]Is it money?
[236:05.43]Do you want money?
[236:05.97]Alright, there's another distress beacon.
[236:13.85]How about these eggs?
[236:25.31]I could use some cash.
[236:28.73]There's two more of these right over here.
[236:30.41]Let's pick them up.
[236:35.15]That's going to be enough.
[236:36.37]I can finally just crap these down.
[236:38.39]This streamer is going to buy the loyalty of his stream viewers.
[236:50.94]Titanium, there it is.
[236:59.09]Mobile vehicle bay.
[237:00.17]I need a lubricant and power cell.
[237:01.85]I believe I have both of those already.
[237:05.53]Power cell and lubricant.
[237:07.79]Alright, guys.
[237:08.41]Let's make it.
[237:09.43]Time to have some fun.
[237:12.63]Mobile vehicle bay being created.
[237:14.09]I thought this was going to be huge.
[237:20.49]It's actually kind of tiny.
[237:24.09]Where did it go?
[237:26.54]Oh, it is large.
[237:27.56]Fabricates vehicles from raw materials.
[237:34.12]Alright.
[237:36.98]What does that mean?
[237:44.66]Should be in water to deploy vehicle bay.
[237:53.07]Okay.
[238:00.72]What is that?
[238:01.12]What did I just do?
[238:06.58]Oh.
[238:08.72]Use vehicle bay.
[238:09.88]Use... What am I doing?
[238:14.81]Seamoth?
[238:17.31]Okay, I can make the Seamoth.
[238:20.75]One person see in space vehicle.
[238:22.19]Space vehicle?
[238:24.69]Another titanium egg, not two glass lubricant.
[238:26.79]Alright, I need more titanium.
[238:32.16]Nice.
[238:32.48]Alright, so this just stays here.
[238:33.58]Now we're going to make a seam off.
[238:37.92]So let's go, let's throw... Drink... No, don't throw that away.
[238:41.64]Drink that.
[238:42.06]Okay, that's fine.
[238:45.68]I'm going to take the food brick.
[238:50.40]And I'm going to throw away these things because they're rotten.
[238:53.22]Store the other stuff and keep the titanium.
[238:59.12]This one's empty.
[239:00.06]Let's store...
[239:02.90]Just this stuff.
[239:04.78]Batteries.
[239:05.26]It's alright.
[239:05.86]I can just come back into these when I need them.
[239:09.00]Let's go get scraps.
[239:15.00]And lots of them.
[239:20.07]There's littering?
[239:22.63]That's alright.
[239:26.81]Drinking water while underwater.
[239:29.23]Something about that does not seem right.
[239:31.04]I agree.
[239:39.57]Metal metal metal metal metal I've already been right here, but it could be metal Damn it Scrap metal come on
[239:59.23]Jeremy is my fourth favorite gamer.
[240:01.09]You know, I actually had a conversation with somebody about this.
[240:06.03]We can talk about it very briefly.
[240:08.08]So if you're in first place, there's a lot of pressure to be number one and to stay number one.
[240:13.14]So if you're number fucking one, all the pressure, all the time, all the energy it takes to be there, all the... You know, you got a lot of people that want to talk to you.
[240:24.09]You're the best.
[240:27.05]And number two...
[240:29.21]Nobody wants to be number two either, because number two has to try so hard to catch number one, and they'll always be second best.
[240:38.76]Your whole life revolves around being the guy that's behind the one that's the most important, right?
[240:47.46]So you don't wanna be first, you don't wanna be second, you don't wanna be third either.
[240:52.40]Because being third means that you have what it takes to be one or two, but you just didn't try hard enough.
[240:59.38]And you just weren't, you kind of just weren't there.
[241:02.06]Maybe, like, something happened, you just couldn't get to number two.
[241:04.73]But you have the potential.
[241:06.49]Number four means you're just four.
[241:09.67]You're not in any position of pressure.
[241:12.05]You're not in, like, a large position of power.
[241:13.93]You're just in fourth fucking place.
[241:15.75]You're not terrible.
[241:18.02]You're not under any huge amounts of pressure.
[241:21.02]You did alright.
[241:21.66]You're doing fine.
[241:26.63]It's that easy.
[241:30.55]I think I have a pretty decent amount now.
[241:35.02]What do I got?
[241:37.52]I got four, eight, nine, ten, so I believe I can do it.
[241:41.22]What do I have for materials?
[241:46.86]That's a very pessimistic viewpoint.
[241:49.34]Oh, but in my mind, I'm number one.
[241:51.70]Right?
[241:53.28]In my brain, I'm number one.
[241:56.14]At everything.
[241:58.34]Including things that I know I'm not good at.
[242:01.39]Just in my brain, you have to think that way.
[242:08.69]Actual psychopath.
[242:19.50]Check the radio.
[242:26.64]If you want it bad enough, it'll come to you.
[242:29.23]But having the fourth place mentality, that's how fourth place sticks around and eventually first place gets sick of trying so hard and being in first place that they dwindle a little.
[242:38.51]They come down to second or third.
[242:40.41]Third place takes the opportunity.
[242:41.94]Oh fuck, I'm gonna be first now.
[242:44.74]Fourth place doesn't have to do shit.
[242:46.48]Fourth place becomes third place.
[242:48.90]And then second place.
[242:50.18]And then first place.
[243:00.41]How many of these do I have?
[243:01.31]I have too many of these.
[243:08.59]Plenty of water now.
[243:11.18]Alright, we need to make the bay thing.
[243:16.05]Vehicle bay.
[243:19.99]There's a lot of things here.
[243:21.77]Trash can.
[243:23.09]Where the hell was it?
[243:26.73]Advanced wiring, disinfected.
[243:28.47]No, no, no, no.
[243:29.53]Vehicles, equipment, vehicles.
[243:32.24]Machines.
[243:34.60]The seam off, there it is.
[243:36.90]So I need power cell, two glass, lubricant, and lead.
[243:42.34]Power cell to glass.
[243:46.50]I don't have any lubricant.
[243:47.84]I can make them with these.
[243:49.22]And I can make, I need to make glass.
[243:53.48]I don't have any, do I have any quartz?
[243:57.34]No, we've got to go get quartz.
[244:00.64]Let's just make, wait.
[244:05.30]I can't make them.
[244:10.58]What is lubricant again?
[244:14.30]No, I need the creepvine seed cluster.
[244:18.67]Well, I have enough space for it.
[244:20.81]Let's just do it.
[244:26.63]I have so much water.
[244:31.33]Let's get a couple of seed clusters.
[244:37.03]And I need quartz.
[244:38.29]Seed clusters and quartz.
[244:52.69]Over here.
[244:59.27]How do I just pick them up?
[245:01.02]Like that.
[245:03.50]How many can I even hold?
[245:04.40]I think that's it.
[245:05.78]One more?
[245:06.06]Yeah, that's good.
[245:11.98]I have them in the lockers already.
[245:13.67]Do I have a quartz in the locker?
[245:16.69]Well, that would be helpful.
[245:25.44]Why am I naked on the webcam?
[245:28.06]Because I'm just, I'm trying as fast as I can to get banned.
[245:31.58]That, that seems like the fastest possible way.
[245:37.18]Quartz.
[245:38.80]I already have glass.
[245:40.12]Oh, whatever.
[245:40.58]Yeah, I figured just, just being naked is just, that's so, you get banned and, and the staff just sees it and gone.
[245:55.34]I still need lead.
[245:58.98]Do I need lead?
[246:02.18]I do.
[246:03.14]I need one lead.
[246:12.21]Was there already lube in the locker?
[246:15.73]I'm just going to make it up and throw it away.
[246:17.09]I need to like... Once I build my base, I actually have to organize.
[246:21.17]I just have waterlogged lockers.
[246:26.55]Okay, now I just need lead.
[246:28.07]Is there any lead in any of my lockers?
[246:38.52]Lead.
[246:39.38]There is!
[246:41.26]Alright, time to make the seamoth.
[246:49.14]Vehicle bay.
[246:50.84]Vehicles.
[246:51.94]Seamoth!
[246:52.21]Seamoth!
[247:00.49]I don't care.
[247:01.67]Now I have a boat.
[247:04.81]Oh, this is so much better.
[247:06.67]Do I lose this thing?
[247:07.47]Is this thing going to be gone if it's destroyed or something?
[247:09.57]I need to take a look at it.
[247:12.25]Does it use gas?
[247:14.61]Access upgrades.
[247:18.19]Boy.
[247:21.75]It doesn't run on leaves.
[247:25.79]Oh, that's not... That's not green.
[247:28.24]Does it run on water?
[247:33.24]Alright, so let's go in.
[247:36.66]Oh, boy.
[247:37.34]Does it have guns?
[247:42.26]This is so cool.
[247:43.81]Oh, this is cool.
[247:44.81]28.
[247:46.81]Okay, let me... Hold on.
[247:48.59]I need to, like...
[247:51.61]Let's park it here.
[247:55.58]I need to bring some stuff.
[247:56.54]We're going deep sea diving right now.
[248:05.72]Now I can use these two.
[248:09.54]That works.
[248:11.15]Enhance the safe diving depth.
[248:12.67]Nice.
[248:13.13]Okay.
[248:15.45]You have upgrades.
[248:17.45]Give me like 10 seconds to look at my inventory and see what I have.
[248:23.69]Is this one of those games where, like, if you don't know exactly what you're doing, everyone's just gonna scream at you?
[248:28.91]I just got the game, like, four hours ago.
[248:33.83]Hello?
[248:35.25]Who is it?
[248:37.07]This is Sunbeam.
[248:38.77]You know Aurora.
[248:40.09]We're from a little trans-gov on the far side of Andromeda.
[248:44.37]Absolutely.
[248:45.09]There's no bad without the good.
[248:47.27]No good without the bad.
[248:49.75]Sounds like you tasted a bunch of the former.
[248:54.20]That's every game.
[248:55.82]You thought this was a paid wacky stream?
[249:02.22]You're right.
[249:02.58]I better do something wacky.
[249:05.49]Otherwise I can't be on the top list of wacky streamers.
[249:11.91]What the hell do these do?
[249:20.10]I need to bring a bunch of snacks and stuff with me if I'm going to go here.
[249:23.76]So I have plenty of water.
[249:25.06]I need food, though.
[249:27.60]Food and... I think that's good.
[249:31.14]Maybe battery?
[249:35.62]Electronics.
[249:36.30]I'm going to bring a couple of... So I need mushrooms and copper ore.
[249:40.82]And then some food.
[249:41.48]And we're going to go.
[249:47.58]I think there's already shit in my walkers for that.
[249:52.01]Yes, there is.
[249:52.79]What about copper ore?
[249:58.31]Maybe in one of these.
[249:59.49]In one of these random boxes, maybe.
[250:03.51]That's just a fire extinguisher.
[250:04.90]Alright, let me bring up flare.
[250:07.96]Just in case things get hairy.
[250:09.04]It might be too dark down there.
[250:09.98]What about in this one?
[250:12.10]Copper ore, good.
[250:13.34]Copper ore.
[250:13.84]No, that's gold.
[250:14.46]Alright, that can make one battery.
[250:21.55]I need one for minerals, I need one for water, I need one for gas.
[250:25.85]I already have one battery.
[250:30.00]I don't think I'm going to need more than a couple of batteries, so let's go ahead and just make them.
[250:38.54]How did he get the poster so early?
[250:40.10]I went into the weird shipwreck.
[250:48.23]Alright.
[250:50.98]uh rotten grapevine I don't want this anymore so what are these why am I still holding these dragon eggs I'm alright hold your horses here it's time to organize we're gonna do a little organization I'm not gonna dick around this is just this is just getting a little out of hand
[251:17.05]So let me just take... We're going to put all the minerals in one or two.
[251:21.96]We're going to throw the dragon eggs on the ground.
[251:28.92]So hold on.
[251:29.78]Just give me a minute.
[251:32.51]No, I'm not just going to go.
[251:34.05]That joke is funny.
[251:35.33]It's funny for the stream.
[251:36.81]But no.
[251:37.73]You're going to have to wait.
[251:40.13]You're going to have to wait.
[251:42.09]Because I'm not... We're going to put minerals in this one.
[251:44.67]Start with titanium.
[251:45.31]Titanium.
[251:49.67]Okay, that's all the minerals.
[251:50.85]We're going to take out the fire extinguisher, the flares.
[251:54.06]I want to make this clean.
[251:56.20]God damn it.
[251:56.78]I can't just make it clean.
[252:00.82]I will, eventually.
[252:01.96]Okay, so where's the other minerals?
[252:06.02]I'm going to rename them.
[252:08.71]Okay, here we go.
[252:09.41]More minerals.
[252:17.27]Is glass a mineral?
[252:18.13]No.
[252:19.25]No, technically not.
[252:20.79]Glass is technically a man-made product.
[252:25.15]Man takes sand, squishes sand in a machine, and it turns into glass.
[252:29.29]That's not a mineral.
[252:32.50]Okay.
[252:35.60]What else do I got?
[252:36.42]One of them might just be for titanium.
[252:39.16]Titanium.
[252:41.14]Alright.
[252:43.17]This is going to have coral reefs and lubricant.
[252:49.66]And sulfur.
[252:53.89]Okay.
[252:56.53]Throw the stupid rotten tomato vine down.
[252:58.49]Let's go back to the... This one here.
[253:03.85]This is so wacky.
[253:05.57]I told you.
[253:06.17]We're not doing wacky shit.
[253:08.30]We're organizing our inventory.
[253:12.70]This is... Okay, the locker's empty.
[253:14.38]No.
[253:14.84]Give me these.
[253:16.94]Shit.
[253:17.24]Okay, one of them has to...
[253:21.56]This one's for sulfur.
[253:22.60]Alright, so this one has to... I need two for minerals.
[253:31.79]Alright, we're gonna do... We're gonna put minerals in the other one, too.
[253:35.15]So let's go with glass.
[253:43.61]Just let me organize my shit, please.
[253:47.30]This is not supposed to be funny right now.
[253:51.19]It's not supposed to be funny.
[253:54.19]It's organizing.
[253:59.38]So then the titanium is going to go in a different box.
[254:04.92]This one.
[254:06.32]This is only going to be for titanium.
[254:10.48]And glass.
[254:13.95]Okay.
[254:14.59]This one is going to be... Okay.
[254:16.27]I need another box.
[254:18.41]No, I got all this water.
[254:19.55]What about the flares?
[254:20.45]Flares are going to go in here too.
[254:24.07]This is just like a birthday cake.
[254:25.35]That's it.
[254:25.65]This is the ingredients for birthday.
[254:26.71]You get egg, flour, candies, and then the star that goes on top of the tree.
[254:37.08]Go back over here.
[254:47.05]God damn it.
[254:47.59]There's still more like... There's still more stuff.
[254:50.11]Get rid of the eggs.
[254:51.69]I don't want these anymore.
[254:53.15]I'm going to throw them on the ground and scan them.
[254:56.44]Alright.
[254:57.86]Let's throw in... This is going to be for actual materials.
[255:11.48]Fucking poster.
[255:13.58]Sulfur's going back downstairs.
[255:17.13]Okay.
[255:18.31]These are going down here.
[255:19.43]Throwing these on the ground.
[255:21.43]Alright.
[255:22.69]Looks good.
[255:24.61]Two battery.
[255:25.43]Who keeps smashing into my door?
[255:27.09]This is so disorganized.
[255:38.13]Should I have to take the birthday candles back from this one?
[255:43.81]Alright.
[255:44.13]Almost done.
[255:44.83]I promise we're almost done.
[255:52.25]I promise.
[255:53.05]Where's the sulfur go?
[255:56.25]First to... Okay, I've already scanned them.
[256:02.76]I thought it was going to hatch and like a monster's going to come out.
[256:07.58]Alright, that's fine.
[256:08.78]Another creature egg I'm going to throw on the ground.
[256:14.20]Alright.
[256:15.06]It has to go in here.
[256:17.26]Let's get rid of this.
[256:19.18]Get rid of these.
[256:23.72]No, take the fucking battery out.
[256:26.79]Alright.
[256:27.71]I'm ready.
[256:30.85]I'm done.
[256:34.45]And I've got one more egg to get rid of.
[256:36.63]I'm going to store some water in here.
[256:43.12]And I'm ready.
[256:44.36]But let me drink some of those waters first.
[256:45.66]I'm going to pull one up.
[256:49.60]Now I need... I've got food.
[256:50.64]Okay, food is 100%.
[256:51.24]No, food's at 63%.
[256:56.14]Fire extinguisher doesn't need to come.
[256:57.42]This is just miscellaneous titanium.
[257:03.01]Okay.
[257:05.61]I'm done.
[257:06.11]Now I just need to make a couple of pieces of food and we can actually leave.
[257:12.17]And then I'm going to be playing this game tomorrow night.
[257:14.41]You better believe it, Buster.
[257:21.76]Come here.
[257:22.90]How are you faster than me?
[257:27.88]Cure the food.
[257:28.42]I just want to fly around on the ship for a minute.
[257:30.34]And then we'll probably, this room will probably be done.
[257:33.28]At about, probably like the five hour mark, I would say.
[257:35.50]I can cook these, can't I?
[257:37.94]Whatever, I missed it already.
[257:38.84]Alright, we're just going to make enough to eat right now, and then we're going to go on a little de-seep adventure.
[257:48.23]De-seep.
[257:49.57]De- I don't know if you guys can even tell what I'm trying to fucking say right now.
[258:10.83]Hey, we're going on a DC, DC Universe Online adventure.
[258:19.59]Alright.
[258:21.11]It's time to go.
[258:22.27]Let's refresh our batteries.
[258:24.94]I'm going to... What do I need to put power in the most?
[258:27.94]Repair two... I'm not going to do it yet.
[258:29.28]I have two batteries that are ready to go.
[258:31.16]Scanner doesn't need batteries.
[258:33.02]Escape pod into this thing.
[258:35.06]Load it up.
[258:37.54]Where's the upgradable unit?
[258:41.48]Where is it?
[258:44.36]No, I want to upgrade the Seamoth.
[258:50.05]Can I do it from outside the vehicle?
[258:56.59]There it is!
[258:56.99]Alright, bingo.
[259:00.50]Seamoth enhances safe diving.
[259:02.80]Bingo.
[259:05.18]Oh, that's not a Cyclops.
[259:06.38]Okay, so I can dive safer.
[259:10.86]Let's do it.
[259:13.17]Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to move.
[259:16.97]We're going to go over here.
[259:21.63]This thing is so much cooler than anything else in the game so far.
[259:24.07]And we go so fast.
[259:25.19]I'm not answering the fucking phone.
[259:31.68]Save the game.
[259:32.48]Here we are.
[259:35.32]28 degrees Celsius.
[259:36.62]That's pretty normal temperature.
[259:38.04]That's pretty room temp.
[259:43.52]Now, where is the ship?
[259:44.30]Are we here?
[259:44.58]Because I want to go back here.
[259:55.95]Go outside the map.
[259:56.89]I don't even know... Can you even do that?
[260:01.84]28 degrees Celsius is not room temp?
[260:05.26]What is it then?
[260:08.90]I don't work in Celsius.
[260:10.20]I work in Fahrenheit.
[260:13.48]As if I'm like a thermostat repairman.
[260:16.34]I don't work in that.
[260:19.10]Alright, so what else can I do over here?
[260:21.62]This is the main event over here, I'm assuming.
[260:25.20]What is that?
[260:25.74]There's something on the ground.
[260:30.22]Can I pick stuff up in the boat?
[260:31.92]Now I have to get out.
[260:32.70]Oh, that's not cool.
[260:34.84]Well, there's something right there, so let's get out of here.
[260:41.23]I think I can make the propulsion cannon now.
[260:43.41]Yes, I can.
[260:44.47]Whatever that does.
[260:47.67]What about this?
[260:48.27]Is this quartz?
[260:50.51]Quartz is trash.
[260:51.31]I don't want it.
[260:57.57]Alright, easy.
[260:58.87]I don't want to bump into shit.
[261:02.23]What is that?
[261:02.71]Salt?
[261:03.17]I don't want it.
[261:05.11]Alright, I'm protected in this thing, right?
[261:13.06]These, like, fish that are normally hurting me.
[261:15.38]Shit.
[261:17.85]Is that gonna... There's a box right here.
[261:18.99]I gotta get it.
[261:19.57]Quick.
[261:22.55]First aid kit.
[261:23.19]I'll take it.
[261:26.97]I am protected.
[261:32.17]And I don't have any oxygen either.
[261:33.57]This is so great.
[261:35.55]I really do love this.
[261:37.94]Alright, this looks like deep sea.
[261:43.18]I think there's a monster here.
[261:47.34]Am I safe in here?
[261:50.17]I got like a Medusa eel.
[261:57.37]Is this thing hostile?
[262:01.37]looks pretty hostile oh yes you are alright well let's go buy him how fast can you swim alright that guy sounds like somebody's brakes how far down can I go alright 300 meters I think is the maximum I can do 200 meters
[262:31.96]If I get out of the boat, is my head gonna pop off?
[262:36.79]It's not gonna be one of those situations where my head explodes, right?
[262:39.17]There's a new thing down here.
[262:44.29]Oh, shit.
[262:45.87]Get it.
[262:46.27]Titanium.
[262:47.09]Oh!
[262:47.23]I don't know.
[262:52.26]I need, like, a mining pick.
[262:57.08]Now we're down deep.
[262:58.70]We're down fairly deep now.
[263:00.62]Oh.
[263:04.20]about this.
[263:05.24]What is over here?
[263:05.90]Deposit?
[263:09.00]Shh, idiot.
[263:09.78]I need to scan these things.
[263:19.23]Approaching crutch?
[263:20.15]What do you mean crutch depth?
[263:22.25]Wait, wait, go back up.
[263:29.10]Oh, I'm gonna turn into like a tuna can?
[263:36.24]How do I... I need to get out here and scan stuff.
[263:40.00]There's a lot of things I've never seen before.
[263:47.44]What is that?
[263:48.36]Oh boy.
[263:49.04]Alright, I'm gonna... Is this just like Battlefield?
[263:53.54]It is.
[263:53.78]Whoa, hey!
[264:00.96]I want to scan this thing.
[264:07.73]A bone shark.
[264:13.37]Come on!
[264:14.09]Finish it!
[264:16.34]Bone shark.
[264:16.64]Alright, what's this?
[264:17.84]Can't do anything.
[264:18.34]What's this?
[264:18.80]Lithium?
[264:22.08]Solve... I don't... Wee!
[264:29.71]Oh!
[264:29.81]Whoa!
[264:31.03]Okay.
[264:31.65]Got it.
[264:33.85]Just don't go down below 300.
[264:39.78]Just bumping into shit.
[264:42.98]What am I hitting?
[264:48.32]Why can there not be laser beams here?
[264:54.24]Let's explore this little cave system.
[264:56.46]I think I ran something over.
[264:58.40]I think I just crushed something's head.
[265:01.54]Oh, yeah.
[265:02.00]I'm just... Jesus.
[265:09.32]It's just like driving on the sidewalk in GTA.
[265:17.77]Shit, that's a giant eel.
[265:21.47]I need to get out and scan it.
[265:26.97]Wow.
[265:27.55]Alright.
[265:30.87]Come here.
[265:33.77]Oh no, please!
[265:36.74]Why are there like three of them?
[265:39.49]Just get enough scans so I can put you in my database.
[265:47.87]Got it.
[265:48.23]Okay.
[265:48.43]What do you mean exercise caution?
[265:56.00]There's a volcano under here?
[266:04.04]Don't go deeper.
[266:04.82]Well, I'm going to go deeper now that you said that.
[266:06.49]Why wouldn't I?
[266:11.03]I'm going to set a break.
[266:17.44]Where am I?
[266:24.64]Does this thing actually take gas?
[266:31.18]How am I going up?
[266:32.87]I'm going down.
[266:42.41]Am I going anywhere?
[266:44.53]Where am I?
[266:50.30]Where the fuck am I right now?
[266:53.78]Look, there's exploded fireworks down here.
[266:55.34]I need to scan them.
[267:02.73]Can I take anything off here?
[267:05.83]Scan this.
[267:06.97]Wait.
[267:07.97]For science.
[267:08.43]Take it off.
[267:08.75]Carve it.
[267:10.80]Ooh.
[267:12.37]Nice.
[267:12.73]Alright.
[267:12.99]I don't know what that does, but I have it now.
[267:16.17]This is very pretty down here.
[267:19.65]These schools of fishes and stuff.
[267:21.47]That's really interesting.
[267:27.14]Power cell.
[267:28.06]Oh, batteries.
[267:29.12]I get it.
[267:29.88]Cool.
[267:33.30]Save the game.
[267:33.94]I will.
[267:42.71]I'm down in a position I can't really be in, though.
[267:48.70]I got a phone call, too.
[267:49.64]Alright, let's go back up a little, just so I can get to about this far down.
[267:59.38]Back up to 193.
[268:00.80]I don't even know what left and right is right now.
[268:13.83]Okay, well here's... What am I hitting?
[268:18.19]What am I bumping into?
[268:24.66]What was that?
[268:30.92]I ended up all the way over here.
[268:32.24]Okay, I don't need to go up for oxygen.
[268:40.74]I feel like I can see better when I'm outside of this ship.
[268:58.97]Where am I going?
[269:01.39]Is it this dark?
[269:02.79]Why is it this dark?
[269:07.27]What is... What's with how dark this is?
[269:08.95]This is not usually like this.
[269:15.48]Am I crazy?
[269:18.76]Wait.
[269:19.84]A mature flora specimen will grow if planted in the right conditions.
[269:26.00]Well, I just ate it.
[269:28.56]Does it grow in my body?
[269:37.04]Streamer discovers nighttime.
[269:38.44]But even when it was nighttime, I feel like I could still see in the water.
[269:54.61]I guess we're going back here.
[269:57.25]Back down a little bit.
[270:03.52]Well, that's far away.
[270:04.63]I'm very far away.
[270:07.45]I just... I'm lost.
[270:08.67]I need to find anything.
[270:09.63]That's where I was.
[270:11.41]Okay, finally.
[270:21.42]Land.
[270:23.58]Can I actually, like, skim the bottom of this?
[270:25.12]Alright, this is... What is this?
[270:26.32]This is the bottom of the boat?
[270:30.61]This is the bottom of the... the Titanic.
[270:34.66]It looks like... Alright, there's something right here.
[270:42.09]Can I scan any of this stuff and bring it back?
[270:44.38]I don't think so.
[271:08.00]Why do I feel like I'm... No, nothing to scan here.
[271:15.66]There's a box down here, though.
[271:19.13]Anything of value in here.
[271:21.19]Doesn't look like it.
[271:27.57]Whoa, watch out.
[271:32.95]Nothing...
[271:36.48]There's a couple of deposits down here though that I kind of want.
[271:38.94]Well, there are alien fish that are swimming around.
[271:42.34]How far down does this go?
[272:01.43]This goes really far down.
[272:08.75]This is actually giving me anxiety.
[272:15.99]That's just like a little standard like mean shark too, right?
[272:31.81]Is there anything actually of value down here?
[272:36.83]Yep, there is.
[272:37.99]Okay.
[272:39.25]Where's that thing?
[272:41.95]That thing's not right here, right?
[272:44.77]No.
[272:50.43]I already got this, but I... Get in!
[272:55.22]No!
[272:55.76]Get in!
[272:57.22]Get in!
[272:58.46]Get in the sea moss!
[273:14.59]I don't think there's anything else over here.
[273:19.11]This looks like the end of the universe.
[273:25.19]I thought that was a dead guy.
[273:26.31]I was like, holy shit.
[273:27.86]Interesting.
[273:34.08]This is obviously their territory.
[273:35.82]I probably should not be here.
[273:45.73]Let's go down.
[273:49.61]I am not scanning that thing.
[273:50.83]I'm not getting out of the ship.
[273:52.71]Not a chance.
[273:53.65]I'm not scanning that.
[273:56.67]I don't care what it is.
[274:02.66]Ram it?
[274:06.06]Alright, after this I'm going to just peruse...
[274:14.73]What is that?
[274:15.67]Is that a back?
[274:16.61]Where is it?
[274:17.97]Just one of these dumb things.
[274:22.49]Oh, just salt deposits.
[274:31.66]Can I scan from here?
[274:32.52]Alright, so you want to ram this?
[274:36.18]What happens if I do?
[274:36.92]I'm going to ram it.
[274:39.36]I'm ramming it.
[274:39.90]Here we go.
[274:51.13]He told me to ram it!
[275:15.07]Why did I ram its face?
[275:16.25]I don't know, I didn't know what it did.
[275:18.43]I got the game saved right there, it's fine.
[275:25.96]Can you reload?
[275:27.50]How do I reload game?
[275:30.80]I'm going to try something.
[275:31.54]I'm going to quit.
[275:33.98]Are you sure on save?
[275:35.00]Last time, since last save, seven minutes.
[275:39.78]I'm sure.
[275:43.04]What save's coming then?
[275:47.98]Okay, play.
[275:50.38]Right here.
[275:50.78]Look at this.
[275:54.59]Everything's fine.
[276:05.96]I'm saving every 10 minutes.
[276:07.48]It's good.
[276:08.34]Nothing bad is going to happen.
[276:10.64]Warning.
[276:11.40]Emergency power only.
[276:13.43]Oxygen production offline.
[276:15.95]What?
[276:18.95]Seamoth.
[276:19.43]Warning.
[276:19.71]Emergency power only.
[276:20.87]Oxygen production offline.
[276:23.75]What is happening here?
[276:25.92]Okay.
[276:26.26]Let's go back.
[276:31.78]Let's make our way out of here.
[276:40.77]This is where I was stuck and lost here.
[276:45.95]You saved 5,000 seagulls.
[276:48.45]Yeah, that's really great.
[276:50.07]Just wait till I implement the command that kills all of them in one press of the button.
[276:55.29]Save as many as you'd like, because when the command comes in eventually, it's going to be, exclamation point, kill all seagulls.
[277:02.36]They're all gone, and they'll all die.
[277:10.64]Anyways.
[277:11.10]No, I just did like a cool move.
[277:18.27]Alright.
[277:19.67]Let's go back here.
[277:22.59]I'm not losing the ship or anything.
[277:26.57]I'm gonna make our way back.
[277:28.76]Press F8 to report bugs.
[277:32.30]And give feedback.
[277:35.64]Alright, well.
[277:37.08]That's good to know.
[277:39.23]The deepest you can go in the game is like 2,000.
[277:40.75]That's insane.
[277:42.93]I feel like this game has a... lot of content.
[277:58.02]But I think I'm gonna wrap it up here.
[278:00.13]I'm gonna get back to the ship and... just put stuff in my bags and everything.
[278:08.46]What is that?
[278:10.75]Can't see from back there.
[278:11.59]Is that just the Titanic?
[278:12.43]I think it is.
[278:14.87]Do a barrel roll.
[278:16.29]Okay.
[278:19.07]I can't.
[278:20.09]Sorry.
[278:28.33]Check the radio.
[278:28.91]I'll check the radio and then... Is that a new monster?
[278:35.25]No.
[278:36.68]It's just one of these things.
[278:44.19]Lots of deep cave systems to explore.
[278:46.37]There seems like a lot of things to explore, not just caves.
[278:51.35]I just can't wait to run into the gigantic shark that is as big as the whole screen.
[278:59.94]That's gonna be fun.
[279:03.77]So, we're probably just going to play this tomorrow.
[279:07.33]I'm very much enjoying this game.
[279:10.57]We'll build the base tomorrow.
[279:11.80]We'll go find a gigantic shark.
[279:13.82]Look down.
[279:20.72]Why am I looking down?
[279:31.45]What time?
[279:32.45]7 o'clock tomorrow.
[279:33.43]7 p.m.
[279:34.17]Eastern time.
[279:36.39]Yeah, the meme funeral can happen.
[279:37.95]Slow down!
[279:39.99]The meme funeral can happen, still.
[279:42.34]That's only going to be like 5 minutes.
[279:43.96]You guys think that's going to be... You think I'm going to dedicate more than like 5 to 10 minutes to these shitty memes?
[279:49.62]No, they get like 5 minutes.
[279:53.44]Let's go in the pod.
[279:58.24]What can I do here?
[279:59.36]Fabricator tools.
[280:00.46]New tool.
[280:02.02]Propulsion cannon.
[280:02.88]Warps gravity to pull and push objects.
[280:04.88]Interesting.
[280:10.09]And off stream, I'm going to do a little bit of research to make sure I kind of know more about the game systems before tomorrow.
[280:19.52]Because we're playing this tomorrow.
[280:21.26]This is very fun.
[280:23.38]I'm very much enjoying this video game.
[280:25.62]Let's listen to the radio and then I'm gonna call the stream for tonight.
[280:30.48]Who is this?
[280:31.24]Hello.
[280:31.40]Four hours of Minecraft.
[280:32.44]Just like Demon's Souls?
[280:33.33]I beat the whole- I beat all of Demon's Souls.
[280:35.51]What are you talking about?
[280:52.56]I beat all of Demon's Souls in like three or four streams.
[281:03.32]Don't spoil stuff.
[281:04.68]Makes the game so much better when everything scares you.
[281:06.75]No, I'm not gonna.
[281:07.47]I don't do that typically anyways.
[281:08.79]I don't, you know, look up videos or pictures of... Hey, what is the biggest scariest part in Subnautica?
[281:15.27]No, I'm just gonna let it happen.
[281:21.52]Wait, you beat Demon's Souls on stream?
[281:23.46]I did.
[281:24.56]It's all documented.
[281:31.77]But that's going to be it.
[281:33.73]Thank you so much, everybody, for watching.
[281:35.79]I'm going to go over the bits now.
[281:38.55]And I'll see you guys tomorrow, same time.
[281:41.25]We'll probably put the same amount of time again tomorrow.
[281:43.53]Probably like four or five hours into the game tomorrow night.
[281:47.77]And I hope to see you there.
[281:51.62]Tomorrow's the meme funeral as well, so I don't think you want to miss it.
[281:55.20]Maybe you do.
[281:56.54]But if you do, you do, right?
[282:01.08]Be careful when researching.
[282:02.12]Well, I'm just going to kind of... I'm just going to get basic, full basic knowledge of how to build things, why are you building things, what do those things do, rather than just titanium put here, funny.
[282:17.07]I'd rather know kind of exactly what the hell's going on.
[282:20.01]So...
[282:21.38]Thanks for watching.
[282:22.70]Take care.
[282:23.02]I'm going to go over the bits.
[282:27.28]And I'll see you guys tomorrow if you're leaving now.
[282:30.56]Full basic, that's right.
[282:33.56]Anyways, let's go back a long time ago.
[282:38.20]Five hours ago.
[282:40.99]Let's put the stream end thing on so you know that I'm ending the stream.
[282:47.43]Let's turn it down just a little bit.
[282:50.89]Right there.
[282:51.36]That's fine.
[282:52.82]We're doing bits.
[282:55.64]Quit out of the game for a second.
[282:56.98]Hold on.
[283:00.98]And quit.
[283:02.50]Okay.
[283:05.09]So, thank you to... Stix Renegade for the $1.
[283:08.87]Stix Fun Fact number 19... 193,745.
[283:10.47]The rose is red.
[283:14.51]This is not a trick.
[283:16.07]Brian May of Queen uses a six pence coin to play his guitar instead of a pick.
[283:24.55]You know, I probably would too.
[283:26.35]Coin is heavier.
[283:27.09]There's more weight to it.
[283:28.81]You can actually... The pick is too flimsy for me.
[283:32.08]I would probably use a coin too.
[283:33.88]Nice, nice fact.
[283:36.06]Nuclear Chamber, thanks for the $1.
[283:37.44]Jerma, this is a horror game.
[283:38.48]I'm starting to find out how that is a true statement.
[283:43.96]Command Rabbit, thanks for the $5.
[283:44.92]It's my birthday today, so I thought, what better gift than giving Jerma money?
[283:50.43]A couple of birthdays today so far.
[283:53.37]Thank you, Command Rabbit.
[283:54.65]Appreciate the $5.
[283:56.07]Happy birthday.
[283:57.03]Everybody please say happy birthday to Command Rabbit.
[284:02.09]Maybe we'll have a trifecta.
[284:03.69]Maybe there'll be three birthdays.
[284:06.96]Gabe DeGrossi, thanks for the $1.
[284:08.22]Hey, Jerma, hope you're all good, man.
[284:09.34]I'm doing good.
[284:10.52]Hope you're doing well yourself, Gabe DeGrossi.
[284:16.64]Clary Drill, thanks for the $5.
[284:18.68]Clary Drill.
[284:20.56]Been watching since 2013.
[284:22.12]Just bought bits.
[284:22.86]Thanks for helping me through a rough semester.
[284:25.46]Keep it up.
[284:28.03]I'm assuming that means you're in college, probably?
[284:32.71]College can be very difficult.
[284:35.58]But as long as you... Look, as long as you do good enough... Because here's the difference between... This is a pro tip for you guys.
[284:43.98]There's a very big difference between college and high school.
[284:48.12]College... You don't have to have straight A's in college.
[284:52.48]Just learn.
[284:53.98]Do it at your own pace.
[284:55.54]Don't like... Fucking flunk out.
[284:58.00]Don't like not go to class.
[284:59.26]A lot of people just don't go.
[285:01.44]I did that for like a week.
[285:04.34]You just gotta be good enough.
[285:07.12]Sure, you can make like the dean's list, but at the end of the day, does that really even matter?
[285:10.92]Do you have to be on the dean's list every single semester?
[285:15.17]Because when you're in high school, you're working towards to have a good GPA to get into good colleges and good schools, right?
[285:22.15]You know, I would be more than happy with a B. I'm talking like I'm your parent.
[285:28.81]You know, son, I'd be more than happy with a B. You don't got to get all As.
[285:33.69]Don't overwork yourself.
[285:38.44]Dean's list is only for personal pride.
[285:41.64]I don't think... You don't put that on your resume, right?
[285:45.73]Do you?
[285:46.83]If you're looking for a job and somebody's like, oh, I see you went to... I see you went to... Donovan College in...
[285:55.26]West Virginia, wow, that's a really good school.
[285:57.54]It says here you made the dean's list four times.
[286:00.44]Like if I'm an employer and I read that and I think that's cool, I'm kind of a turd, right?
[286:06.34]You can determine that that person's probably like a kind of a square, you know what I mean?
[286:10.04]Oh, wow, on the dean's list four times.
[286:12.67]Me too.
[286:13.67]It's like, I don't know if I want to work there.
[286:16.29]I'd want to work at some place where the guy just kind of is, well, you went to school, nice, that's a good school.
[286:20.37]You know, I played lacrosse there, oh, cool.
[286:27.83]I wish Jerma was my dad.
[286:32.06]AP classes help.
[286:34.82]They do.
[286:37.14]But you just need a degree.
[286:40.26]When you have a degree, it doesn't say what your GPA was.
[286:44.41]You just get it.
[286:46.79]I have my degree framed, sitting hung with pride.
[286:53.70]And I think I probably had like a 2.9 or like a somewhere around like a 3.0 grade point at GPA.
[287:01.92]Doesn't say that on the degree.
[287:03.20]I just have it.
[287:06.14]I did not take any AP classes.
[287:07.45]No, I was just in college prep classes, CP.
[287:13.25]Degree from clown college.
[287:16.31]Those moron scientists are just a bunch of squares.
[287:21.43]What's my degree in communications?
[287:25.71]I got a degree in mass media.
[287:28.29]Film, TV, and radio.
[287:32.67]Pretty much.
[287:37.39]Leon the Lion Rahr, thanks for the $5.
[287:39.31]Jerma, say hi to the Reaper Leviathan.
[287:41.67]They are friendly buds to hang out with.
[287:42.95]I believe that's the last enemy that I came across.
[287:46.91]Right?
[287:49.76]That's the weird hammerhead snake face person.
[287:53.60]Right?
[287:56.95]Oh, sorry.
[287:57.39]It's an associates plus one communication.
[288:00.71]Film, TV, and radio all dead.
[288:04.45]Well, a... Somebody could tell you that, like, this, what I'm doing right now, fits in, like, mass media.
[288:14.78]Right?
[288:16.10]It's not a TV show.
[288:17.88]It's not a film.
[288:20.44]It's not a radio show.
[288:21.70]But, I mean, it's kind of like a combination of all three of those things.
[288:26.11]A Twitch stream is, like, 40% radio show, 30% television show, and, like, 10% guy is a moron, right?
[288:35.46]Like, I'll give you that 10%.
[288:36.42]And film is dead?
[288:40.60]Depends what you mean by that.
[288:47.33]Sure, Jeremiah.
[288:48.59]Whoa, what is this?
[288:49.39]Like, what are you watching right now?
[288:57.18]This isn't a TV show.
[288:58.98]It's like an internet show.
[289:00.46]The world has changed.
[289:01.36]10% reason to remember the name.
[289:09.98]What is that?
[289:16.42]What am I watching?
[289:17.51]I don't know.
[289:18.01]I've been trying to figure this out for a few years.
[289:20.47]What the hell this even is.
[289:21.71]What platform this is.
[289:25.32]But by golly, in the next couple of months, you're going to see a revolution.
[289:30.14]God damn it.
[289:30.98]I keep forgetting and I have to get that fucking jello pad to save myself from hurting my hand.
[289:36.78]You're going to see a revolution of the platform.
[289:40.60]Much sooner than you think.
[289:43.90]Speaking like, yes, I'm going to revolutionize the world.
[289:47.41]But something in particular that's going to happen within the next probably one to two months.
[289:52.59]And I hope, I hope you guys like it.
[289:54.61]There's going to be a lot of work that goes into it.
[289:56.79]We'll see.
[289:57.65]Might just be a total catastrophic fucking failure.
[290:01.27]But at least I'm going to try.
[290:02.31]I'm going to use my plus one associates mass media degree and see if I can figure it out.
[290:12.43]I'm creating my own country.
[290:19.56]I still need to go on trial.
[290:22.72]Exactly.
[290:25.87]That's all I'm going to say.
[290:28.85]So, thank you to... Charlie Cobb Salad, we got you before.
[290:35.23]But Charlie, happy birthday if you're still watching.
[290:37.03]That was the... One of the two birthday... Spoiler.
[290:43.96]That's not a spoiler.
[290:45.44]Spoiler.
[290:48.26]I just said... I said exactly.
[290:50.08]I didn't say anything else.
[290:55.01]But thank you, Charlie, if you're still watching.
[290:57.91]The Trash Man, thanks for the $1.
[290:59.21]Hey, Jerma, what's your opinion on goldfish crackers?
[291:01.09]The snack that smiles back.
[291:04.01]They're great.
[291:04.67]Especially if you combine them.
[291:06.58]You take pretzel goldfish and you take the cheddar cheese goldfish.
[291:11.36]Dump the bags into a bowl, mix them up, shake them up.
[291:14.56]You can't get better than that with goldfish.
[291:15.98]Telling you.
[291:17.86]You'll never eat goldfish the same way ever again.
[291:19.81]And make sure you have at least one pretzel and one cheddar in each mouthful that you do.
[291:27.63]But thank you, Trashman.
[291:28.35]Thank you also to Hydra for the $1.
[291:29.77]Pee-pee-poo-poo.
[291:30.51]Great.
[291:32.19]That is one of my favorite comments.
[291:34.06]I say that all the time, especially when I'm, like, booking doctor's appointments.
[291:37.98]Nate34k, thanks for the $15.
[291:40.96]Don't collect everything.
[291:41.90]You will have very limited inventory space.
[291:46.68]Something that I'm learning in this game is... You have... I'm like farting out of my mouth.
[291:51.70]Do you hear that?
[291:52.36]I opened my mouth and like a fart sound came out.
[291:55.36]I didn't do anything.
[291:58.08]I'm starting to learn very, very quickly here that that's... You need to be very cautious of your inventory space.
[292:04.33]But thank you for the 15 bucks, dude.
[292:07.91]FJBH10, thanks for the bits.
[292:09.57]Jug... Are you trying to say Jupiter or are you just saying Jug?
[292:16.70]Again, thanks for the 50 cents there, FGBH.
[292:19.92]I don't know what a jug is.
[292:22.83]I know what a jug is, but I don't know what the jug you're referencing is.
[292:27.45]Then we had Amco again for the $100.
[292:29.85]Long time ago, but if you're still here, thanks a lot, man.
[292:35.15]Topac, thanks for the $10.
[292:36.03]Welcome back, Topac.
[292:39.73]just say uptime question mark what's going on here thank you for the ten dollars I'm not sure I think by that point maybe the stream was something was going on talking about jughead wait like jughead like from archie jughead Jones the guy that's always eating cheeseburgers he doesn't need any other food that guy's entire diet is just cheeseburgers and milkshakes
[293:10.17]not me I eat fresh fish I eat lentils I'm not jughead Jones I don't hang out at a shitty diner all day reading this four hours later I told you this is what happens look I let's go I'm gonna go over this one more time one more time because it's very I I don't want people to think that I'm some kind of uh
[293:37.43]I really wish there was a scenario where I could stop in the middle of the stream and do what I'm doing right now.
[293:45.39]But like I've said before, I really don't... And if it's possible, if I'm like... Like, for instance, Monster Hunter, right?
[293:51.57]During Monster Hunter, we... There's a lot of downtime.
[293:56.27]That was you in the town, just crafting things for 20 to 30 minutes at a time.
[294:02.66]But I really just don't like...
[294:05.84]And I'm going to use a term here, but it's not the term that I really might be correct, but I don't want to like interrupt the flow of a stream.
[294:17.01]And it sucks because there's really no alternative unless you do something where.
[294:23.49]You know, maybe, like, halfway through the stream, you stop and you do it, or, like, you tell people that you're gonna stop.
[294:28.12]But I would rather just kind of try to get them as I see them, and then, like, here at the end, make sure I go over all of them, and make sure that, you know, I talk about it.
[294:38.11]I don't read subs anymore.
[294:39.83]I feel like it... I have a lot of trouble to begin with, with trying to keep on task and on track in games and on topics.
[294:48.62]And I have a lot of trouble staying on topic.
[294:50.96]So throwing another variable where I'm going to stop and read out bits in the middle of something, right?
[294:55.57]Let's say something's happening on the screen that's important or...
[294:58.57]that I need to pay attention to.
[295:00.01]I have such a scattered fucking brain that I can't juggle all of them at the same time.
[295:04.79]So I'd rather have a system where I can do this at the end, where we can just chill and talk.
[295:10.60]And I don't, like, stop the stream in the middle to do it.
[295:15.28]I wish there was another alternative.
[295:16.42]And there might be.
[295:17.18]I just need to get... Like, I need, like, a programmer.
[295:19.40]I've talked about this.
[295:19.98]I want to do, like, end credits.
[295:22.12]This is all pie-in-the-sky pipe dream shit that I, like, want to start to do.
[295:28.65]But I think this is the best temporary, slightly permanent solution that I've come up with.
[295:35.58]It's kind of just hanging out for like 30 or 40 minutes.
[295:37.58]Because think about that, right?
[295:38.86]If I sit, and obviously I'm getting a lot of attention to each individual bit, like I go off track and I go off topic, but it takes usually like 30 to 40 minutes at the end of a stream to do the bits.
[295:50.01]So that's 30 or 40 minutes in the middle of the stream that scattered throughout a three or four hour stream, there'll be 40 minutes of bit reading.
[296:00.66]So putting it all at the end of the stream, it gives me no, it's not like I'm gonna stop, I'm gonna have to focus on it, I can just sit here and hang out.
[296:10.24]And we can just chill and have like a decent time hanging out and talking.
[296:17.16]You honestly love the ending credit chill, makes me feel like a good little community bonfire is up.
[296:21.68]Yeah, I like that too, because like I said, giving, like I can sit here for as long as I want and give as much attention as possible.
[296:31.35]I don't want it to be like an afterthought where it's like, oh, thanks, uh, hey, Topac, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[296:35.79]Oh, look out.
[296:36.27]Oh, I got a guy here.
[296:36.99]Fuck.
[296:37.73]Oh, where are you?
[296:38.45]Oh, shit, look out.
[296:39.35]I would rather be able to sit here and actually focus on it.
[296:44.35]Because that's what would happen if I did it the other way.
[296:46.73]You know what I mean?
[296:50.79]And I don't expect, like, obviously, like, if you don't want to sit here and hang out for like 30 or 40 minutes, if you just wanted to hang out for the stream, then you can absolutely do that.
[296:58.97]You know what I mean?
[297:00.62]So, that's kind of the way it's going to work.
[297:05.22]But, moving on, let's continue.
[297:09.91]Thank you, Topek, though.
[297:11.15]You were an example there, but, you know, I do appreciate all of it.
[297:19.78]I read chat, too.
[297:23.24]Chat is another one of those situations, if you want me to talk more candidly.
[297:27.64]Again, I have a lot of trouble focusing on things to begin with.
[297:30.48]So looking over at chat and looking over at the game, looking over at chat, my brain sometimes just can't handle it.
[297:35.54]Especially if it's a game that you have to pay attention to.
[297:38.64]So there are some games that I would read chat way more than others.
[297:44.01]If the game doesn't require 100% of my attention, you know?
[297:50.15]But moving on, thank you to Viper.
[297:53.35]1128 for the $1.
[297:53.91]Build a scanner and also turn on facecam.
[297:58.52]I might turn on the facecam.
[298:00.42]If the game really is like a scary game once you get going, maybe I will just mess around with it.
[298:04.08]Who knows?
[298:05.38]Not giving any promises.
[298:08.36]Thank you, Sam.
[298:09.38]Sam N. The Mod Sam N. For the $1.15.
[298:13.06]Two windmills are standing next to each other.
[298:16.33]One asked the other, what's your favorite kind of music?
[298:19.35]The other says, I'm a big metal fan.
[298:22.93]I like that one.
[298:24.57]You're not going to get a scoff from me from that one.
[298:26.33]That was a great one.
[298:27.44]Thank you, Sam.
[298:30.06]Smellyboy11, thanks for the $1.
[298:32.18]Well over five years of TF2 being fun.
[298:35.06]Less than a year of Overwatch being fun.
[298:38.10]Really gets your noggin joggin, hey?
[298:44.60]Wait, are you talking about me?
[298:48.65]Oh, you're referencing me.
[298:49.49]Okay.
[298:51.03]Um...
[298:52.81]Well, that's just because they're different games.
[298:57.97]Let me address this.
[298:58.95]I've addressed it before and I'm going to address it again.
[299:00.52]Because who knows how many people actually are watching or tune into every stream or even heard me say this before.
[299:09.54]Overwatch does not allow you to do whatever you want.
[299:17.21]I had so much fun in Team Fortress kind of just doing whatever the fuck I want.
[299:23.36]And if that was, I'm going to do something strange, there was like a whole ecosystem.
[299:28.00]There were plenty, there were tons of new players.
[299:30.18]There were tons of people that were really good at the game, but they all, they all formed in the same line.
[299:37.13]And you'd get like, you could just walk around.
[299:38.73]If you didn't have to play Team Fortress, you could literally walk around as the spy and be disguised and just watch crazy shit happen and watch funny things, watch scenarios play out.
[299:48.00]Like they're a living, breathing ecosystem in the game.
[299:51.23]Watching, like, three engineers build, like, four centuries, like, three centuries and, like, seven buildings in a spot that they never should have, but they're just having a goddamn blast.
[300:01.17]And maybe they kill, like, one dude that walks by and they're doing... Stuff like that used to make me so happy.
[300:08.69]Overwatch is much more a game designed around playing every game to win.
[300:17.52]Now, yes, there are, like, the game modes.
[300:19.18]There are... You can just jump into casual.
[300:20.92]But even in casual, you're expected to play the meta and try really hard.
[300:27.99]And it's just taking the point and trying to win.
[300:30.49]And that's fine.
[300:31.27]That's okay.
[300:31.73]The game is a great... Overwatch is good.
[300:33.67]It's a really fun game.
[300:34.65]I really like it.
[300:37.91]But I don't, like, necessarily care anymore about trying to win every game.
[300:43.07]And I think that started happening maybe, like, two or three years ago.
[300:47.05]Where I started to get a little bit older.
[300:49.13]And trying to be really, really, really good in Overwatch or something.
[300:54.88]It doesn't really do it for me anymore.
[300:57.16]As much as other things would have.
[301:02.17]They're pushing it to be like an eSport, and that's fine.
[301:04.33]And a lot of people really like it, and it's really, really intense to watch, and it's very, very... The game is, you know, there's really good players.
[301:11.44]I am not saying that if you play Overwatch, like, you're some kind of tryhard or something.
[301:17.30]That's not what I'm saying.
[301:19.13]It's just a different mindset when you play.
[301:23.25]Still a very fun game, but it's not the same mindset when I played TF2.
[301:35.39]And that's pretty much that.
[301:38.95]Is it intense to watch?
[301:40.11]Well, yeah, because there's ultimates in that game.
[301:44.01]Overwatch has these giant flashy moves that people can do every one or two minutes.
[301:50.77]So obviously there's like big intense moments on the point that are manufactured because people have ultimate moves.
[301:58.18]So it just, it designs itself to be a, oh shit, here it comes kind of game.
[302:05.82]The ubercharge in TF2 is the ultimate.
[302:07.86]That, you know, that's a good point.
[302:09.31]But that's it.
[302:10.21]That is the only, like, holy shit, here it comes!
[302:13.97]Imagine if every character had a special ultimate move like that that was nearly unstoppable.
[302:23.45]I'm not saying it's like skillful, like pressing Q, right?
[302:25.97]That's the big joke.
[302:27.21]It's not about skill in that regard.
[302:29.15]It's about timing and how powerful the moves are and how game-changing and match-changing they can be.
[302:35.93]There's really only one of those things in TF2 and it's the Uber Charge.
[302:39.14]Or the Crit Scree.
[302:40.26]Whatever one you happen to be using.
[302:44.28]Soldier Bugles, but that's not a special move.
[302:47.85]That's more of a small buff that you can give to people.
[302:51.72]That is the equivalent of an ultimate .5 in Overwatch.
[302:59.88]The flog?
[303:00.48]I wouldn't consider the flog.
[303:03.94]The flog, you suck if you have the flog.
[303:06.66]As crazy powerful as the flog ultimate quote is, a sniper just has to fucking shoot you in the head and you're done.
[303:12.96]You're just dead.
[303:15.24]Or anybody just has to focus you and you instantly die.
[303:17.74]A lot of the ultimates in Overwatch do crazy things for your character.
[303:24.55]The flog.
[303:28.94]Having never played Team Fortress, I have no idea what any of this means.
[303:33.44]If you've never played TF2, honest to God, you've got to play it.
[303:39.66]Imagine going back, some of you guys that are veterans of Team Fortress, imagine going back and never having any idea what TF2 was and playing it for the first time.
[303:49.71]Wow.
[303:52.01]That would be... Dude, you've got like three years of awesome game time.
[303:59.56]You have like a full two or three years of content you can enjoy in that game.
[304:05.08]At least.
[304:07.08]That is... You know, sometimes I think about how awesome that would be.
[304:10.48]Imagine going back and using the ambassador for the first time.
[304:14.71]Holy shit, this is fucking awesome!
[304:18.17]The spy is the best class ever!
[304:23.82]Building buildings for the first time with a wrench is just... Nothing can compare.
[304:31.20]But we digress.
[304:33.93]Thank you for the bits, Smelly Boy.
[304:37.35]Appreciate it.
[304:37.89]Thanks for the $1.
[304:38.35]Hopefully that answered... It didn't really ask a question.
[304:41.13]You kind of just made a comment and we went off there.
[304:43.69]But thank you, Smelly Boy.
[304:45.95]T-Dog, the man, thanks for the $1.
[304:47.55]So, Jerma, if you could breathe in, move mouth away and breathe down their throat, why not just hand them the breathing mask?
[304:55.01]Well, if handing the person the breathing mask would make them breathe in the oxygen.
[304:59.34]I was putting the hypothesis there that if you breathe in the oxygen and then very quickly breathe into their mouth, is that carbon dioxide yet?
[305:09.00]Or did it not have enough time to turn into carbon dioxide?
[305:12.34]I don't know.
[305:14.42]Ask the guy from Mythbusters to do an episode on it.
[305:17.08]I'm sure they'll figure it out.
[305:20.13]Thank you, TechnoToast, for the 50 cents.
[305:23.23]Local streamer takes hit of oxygen and spits Hawaiian punch in audience's mouth live on stream.
[305:33.02]Thank you MooMeansMoo for the $1.
[305:34.88]Local streamer gets Hawaiian punch mama birded directly into his mouth.
[305:42.14]Yeah, what about CPR?
[305:44.54]Somebody just said in the chat, what about CPR?
[305:47.02]So wait, I'm breathing into your mouth for CPR and it brings you back to life.
[305:51.18]So what's going on there?
[305:56.06]CPR isn't for oxygen.
[305:57.65]What are you talking about?
[305:59.99]You breathe in their mouth.
[306:06.19]I think I got my science.
[306:07.79]Fucking scientist.
[306:09.35]Idiots.
[306:12.03]Thank you, Marshall Magali for the $1.
[306:14.25]Happy New Year, Jeremy.
[306:15.07]Don't get too drunk.
[306:16.91]And put your pants back on.
[306:20.21]I haven't wore pants since the 19th.
[306:24.42]Let's see.
[306:27.47]No, I haven't worn pants since February 14th.
[306:33.14]I mean, January 14th.
[306:39.34]We're doing two weeks in the future.
[306:44.46]Nifty gave the 10 bucks earlier.
[306:45.88]Thank you, Nifty.
[306:46.50]Favorite streamer, favorite game?
[306:49.99]Hey, thank you, first of all.
[306:52.13]It is a very good game.
[306:52.93]I'm enjoying my time in it so far.
[306:56.16]It's very nice.
[306:56.66]It's very interesting.
[306:58.54]Relaxing.
[306:59.36]Scary.
[307:00.56]Can't wait to get the AK-47.
[307:01.78]It's gonna be good.
[307:04.56]MooMeansMoo, thanks for the $1.
[307:05.60]Uh... Kendrick Lamar's Sing About Me.
[307:12.37]I'm dying of thirst, but every time your character screams in agony, it speeds up.
[307:16.11]What?
[307:18.83]What?
[307:21.66]Oh, you're talking about... I... I... Every time... Where did that come from?
[307:29.79]Who decided to make those?
[307:32.77]Does it start with a B movie?
[307:37.11]Every time they say the word B, the movie... It's the whole movie.
[307:41.11]But every time they say the word B, it speeds up by times two.
[307:45.03]That's the first one to do that, right?
[307:50.57]Probably.
[307:53.69]The video was like 12 minutes long or something.
[307:59.10]Thank you Stix for the $1 and they just say dot dot dot slash dot dot.
[308:03.54]Oh, they're saying they're doing Morse code.
[308:06.30]I think that means save our ship.
[308:08.28]Thanks, dude.
[308:11.00]Sad Delph26, thanks for the $1.
[308:12.42]Hey, Jeremy, I've been watching since late 2011 and felt it was time I finally gave something back for all the happiness you brought me.
[308:20.28]Well, thank you.
[308:21.46]Thank you, Sad Elf.
[308:23.62]Sad Elf, not Sad Elf.
[308:25.46]Sad Elf.
[308:27.34]Saying words, man.
[308:28.54]It's just sometimes I look at Twitch alerts and I see them all as one word like this, right?
[308:32.57]Like... Like... That's what it looks like to me.
[308:38.61]Like, there's no capitalization.
[308:40.17]It's just Sad Elf.
[308:42.29]It's not Sad Elf.
[308:44.11]It's hard for me to... Sad Elf is what I see on my Twitch alerts.
[308:51.52]So you see?
[308:52.08]But thank you.
[308:57.04]For the $1.
[308:59.46]Thanks for being a long-term viewer as well.

[310:53.22]Appreciate the 10 bucks.
[310:56.32]Kyla, thank you, Kyla, for the $1.
[310:58.92]You're literally surrounded by water and still having trouble with fire.
[311:06.81]Yeah, but the fire that I was having trouble with was outside of the water.
[311:11.20]Should I just bring a bunch of buckets with me and throw it on there?
[311:18.12]Thank you, Little Tiffy, though, for the 10 bucks.
[311:20.30]And thank you, Kyla, for the $1 there.
[311:23.14]Surrounded by water.

[311:36.77]Grizzly1620, thanks for the $1.
[311:38.45]When you were growing up, what was your dream job?
[311:42.25]I think I've probably answered this before.
[311:43.47]I want to be an actor.
[311:44.10]I want to be in movies.
[311:48.72]Or at least be on TV or something.
[311:52.82]That was kind of the dream.
[311:53.56]And if that wasn't that, then I wanted to... I kind of wanted to be like a... Well, we already talked about what I wanted to be when I was like a child.
[312:04.99]But yeah, it was probably actor.
[312:11.43]Or making videos, making... I've really liked that since I was like 12.
[312:14.87]It's kind of... It's what I wanted to do.
[312:18.72]An actor.
[312:20.02]Yeah.
[312:22.46]Topac, thanks for the five bucks.
[312:24.08]I want 35% equity in your $5.
[312:25.18]So that means... What is 35% of 500?
[312:27.77]Let's do a calculation.
[312:28.59]So 500.
[312:28.71]Okay, so...
[312:40.06]you are gonna get, so you're gonna get $175.
[312:42.40]So of your $5 donation here, you're gonna keep $175.
[312:45.54]No, you're gonna keep $1.
[312:46.32]Wow, that would be a real turnover on me.
[312:48.36]For your $5, I'm gonna give you $175.
[312:49.12]$1.75, $1.75.
[312:49.16]There is a decimal point there in front of the one, or behind the one.
[312:51.00]What a great investment that would be.
[313:10.09]Thank you, though.
[313:13.47]Thank you to Dearly Beloved for the three bucks.
[313:16.65]Light Gun Hype 2 Time Crisis Boogaloo.
[313:19.05]That's going to be a lot of fun.
[313:19.75]I can't wait to do that.
[313:21.85]I actually have extreme confidence in doing a very high-level gameplay Light Gun streams.
[313:30.16]Remember that.
[313:31.44]Don't hit the board.
[313:32.52]Don't hit the desk.
[313:34.00]Remember me saying this.
[313:36.22]I'm going to impress the absolute hell out of you guys.
[313:40.77]But thank you, dearly beloved, for the $3.
[313:42.31]Grizzly1620, thanks for the $1.
[313:43.91]Did you know there's an erotic novel called There's a Bitcoin in My Butt and He is Handsome by Dr. Chuck Tingle.
[313:55.92]It's part of a Humble Bundle.
[313:59.88]Well, I don't have any interest in playing that game.
[314:04.43]I don't know why I would buy that game.
[314:07.23]It's in a Humble Bundle.
[314:08.13]Okay.
[314:09.99]Thank You Matisse for the 25 cents people's W for the $1 heck frick oh So the note we were doing no swears allowed which I did all I did pretty well in I did okay Little Tiffy again for the $1.
[314:24.64]I cannot wait to play mine crap My crash really not that bad of a game if you really objectively pull yourself out and look at it I
[314:34.75]Forget about, like, all the... Forget about all the YouTube channels that made and continue to make, like, 38-minute live Minecraft Let's Plays.
[314:45.93]Like, forget about those channels.
[314:48.29]And forget about, like, what Minecraft... Because that's what, like, soured Minecraft for everybody.
[314:53.72]Is the guy with the face cam in the corner making, like, nine videos a day on a Minecraft Let's Play, right?
[315:01.16]Like, get rid of that.
[315:02.66]Look at Minecraft objectively.
[315:04.02]It's actually like a pretty interesting game.
[315:11.79]I mean, it's kind of like a... It's just building.
[315:15.37]It's just Legos.
[315:16.07]It's just digital Legos for a new generation.
[315:21.25]I don't play Minecraft.
[315:22.31]I haven't played it in a long time.
[315:24.10]But think of it like that.
[315:28.34]All the children ruined it for me.
[315:29.98]But it's...
[315:32.74]But it's... But that's our future.
[315:35.10]That's the future generation.
[315:36.88]You know how many architects and engineers we're going to have?
[315:39.74]Because all these little kids that play Minecraft and make these elaborate buildings?
[315:44.93]That kid's going to go on to be an aircraft engineer.
[315:52.73]He's going to go on to do 3D modeling.
[315:56.53]He is going to get a top-level job.
[316:03.99]future buildings future buildings are just gonna be Minecraft blocked out they're gonna look terrible like all the new engineers are like from Minecraft kids and they grew up yeah I think we should have a dish block goes here all our new skyscrapers are like pixelated why is that making me laugh it's just they just take big bricks of squares and put them in and color them different colors
[316:39.55]Mark my words, Jerma will play Minecraft one day.
[316:42.23]No, I won't.
[316:44.73]There's no reason why I ever will.
[316:47.74]Don't worry.
[316:48.54]It's not gonna happen.
[316:51.98]Hey, thank you, Joe Dirt.
[316:53.32]One, two, one, two for the five bucks.
[316:55.36]Hey, Jerma, I just realized I didn't account for American to Canadian exchange rate on my past donations, so I gotta slow down with the $50 for now.
[317:04.19]But I'll be back.
[317:05.59]Anyways, have an unscrupulously good night, my dude.
[317:07.99]Well, thank you, Joe Dirt, for the $5.
[317:10.15]American to Canadian exchange rate.
[317:14.80]That is something you do need to be aware of.
[317:18.99]But thank you for the contributions, dude.
[317:21.43]Don't worry.
[317:21.87]Don't feel like you have to give money.
[317:25.80]You can give it to me if you want.
[317:27.74]But I hope you don't ever feel like you need to.
[317:32.12]Appreciate it nonetheless, dude.
[317:33.16]Thank you.
[317:36.15]Hydra725, thanks for the $1.
[317:38.79]Roses are red, violet to blue.
[317:39.87]Jerma is mad.
[317:40.69]PP Poo Poo.
[317:43.05]We've had... That seems to be a running theme here.
[317:45.13]We've had like two or three donations now that are just PP Poo Poo.
[317:51.33]We got a low-hanging fruit there.
[317:54.97]Thank you Kyla again for the one dollar.
[317:56.45]I've been waiting so long for episode one of Jermautica.
[318:00.35]Where we see the lore continuation of JermaCraft and you finally get a house.
[318:05.17]Well, we didn't see a house built at all, so maybe it'll never happen.
[318:10.19]Top Kek Kappa, thanks for the ten bucks.
[318:14.29]There's a big meanie at the ship, at the front of the ship.
[318:17.62]Go beat him up.
[318:19.43]I think we actually ended up seeing the big meanie.
[318:22.90]And he did beat me up, not the other way around.
[318:25.56]But thank you, Topkek Kappa, for the 10 bucks.
[318:28.43]Appreciate it, man.
[318:30.93]Joe Dirt again for the $5 here.
[318:33.11]Thank you, Joe Dirt.
[318:33.95]Also, I've been wanting to say, I'm sure you've already realized this, but the fact that you can play some of the shittiest games known to man and still get success speaks a lot to how strong of a fan base you've built.
[318:44.72]A lot of YouTubers get stuck in their niche game and never get to leave.
[318:48.20]Minecraft.
[318:48.84]We just talked about this.
[318:50.40]That's very relevant.
[318:52.04]But everyone is here for you.
[318:53.28]Plus, you have the attention span of a chipmunk with Alzheimer's.
[318:56.75]You can never stick to one game forever.
[318:59.32]Thank you so much, Joe Dirt.
[319:01.50]Um... The... Here's the thing.
[319:05.98]You kind of explained why I can't do that.
[319:08.48]And as much as I've wanted to, it's never been possible.
[319:12.57]I... I have to have my attention held by something.
[319:17.09]And I don't want to do the same thing every day.
[319:19.81]I just don't.
[319:21.03]In fact, I like straight up refuse.
[319:23.51]And... Sometimes you'll see me...
[319:28.62]cancel streams and push streams forward or come back in like a few days or something because I want the streams to be different I want them to be I don't know maybe like something that I haven't tried before something you've never seen before that that's very important to me I cannot do the same thing for more than like a week or two I just can't
[319:52.61]But it can also be, to my detriment too, that can also be a curse.
[319:57.61]Because when you're constantly, like for instance, if I just turned on the stream and it played, let's just use Subnautica as a hypothetical, just a pure hypothetical situation, right?
[320:06.31]I very well could, let's just say I played Subnautica for like the next two months straight, every stream.
[320:14.46]That is, like, guaranteed, in quotes, content, right?
[320:19.71]I don't have to worry about what I'm gonna do today, what I'm gonna do tomorrow, what I'm gonna do next week.
[320:23.83]It's just, I'm gonna play Subnautica for three months.
[320:27.27]And people do that.
[320:28.73]Or, like, I'm gonna play, like, Final Fantasy XV for, like, two straight weeks and beat the whole thing, right?
[320:34.80]It's, like, guaranteed.
[320:37.90]But... The flip side for that for me is I get bored very easily.
[320:43.26]to a point where if I spend more than 10, 20, or 30 hours in a game at this point, it means I really, really like it.
[320:55.38]Go stream Card Thief.
[320:58.62]But I hope that kind of adds to that conversation a little.
[321:05.01]But again, that's one of the reasons why I can be kind of scatterbrained, where, I want to do this, I want to do that, I want to do this, I want to do that.
[321:11.26]I can't do that right now.
[321:12.22]I need, like, another week to be able to do that.
[321:14.26]But what am I going to do today?
[321:15.66]I'll do this today.
[321:16.38]But I want to do this, like, in two weeks.
[321:17.65]No, next week I'm going to do this.
[321:18.45]Like, I'm so all over the place that it actually hurts sometimes.
[321:22.19]As much as it helps, it actually hurts too.
[321:26.61]And hurts is a very bad way to say that, but I think you know what I mean, right?
[321:34.55]But thank you so much, Joe Dirt.
[321:35.93]Appreciate it.
[321:38.05]Hydra725, thanks for the $1.
[321:40.03]Jeremy, you are the pee-pee to my poo-poo.
[321:42.59]Thanks, Hydra, again for the $1 here.
[321:45.14]I want pee-pee poo-poo to become a new donation message meme.
[321:48.56]By the way, these are messages from two hours ago.
[321:51.26]So here they are.
[321:54.38]We are actively seeing it happen.
[321:58.20]In real time.
[321:59.46]And these are in the past.
[322:01.18]This is like the streams from like two and a half hours ago.
[322:05.78]Hen Hen, thanks for the $1.
[322:07.26]Hen Hen 724.
[322:09.22]This is the stream where you went to two different places.
[322:11.84]You had already looted and failed to build a base.
[322:16.37]Well, I got called from the beacons.
[322:18.47]I didn't know that was what was going to happen.
[322:21.87]Thank you Peoples W for the $1.
[322:23.49]Shterma, we love you to bits.
[322:25.09]Ha ha ha.
[322:26.79]Why did I just say it like that?
[322:27.95]Ha ha ha.
[322:29.11]No, it was in all capitals.
[322:30.17]It was like...
[322:33.32]Get it right or don't do it, Jeremy.
[322:35.98]You clearly saw what the dialog was.
[322:37.80]You clearly saw what was on the script and you half-assed it.
[322:40.70]Don't half-ass it and read it the way it's written.
[322:43.93]Yes, director.
[322:44.41]Yes, I will.
[322:44.87]Next time.
[322:47.15]Little Tiffy, thanks for the $1.
[322:48.87]Swift Rage.
[322:50.27]Thank you.
[322:51.37]Galaxia PHA, thanks for the $3.
[322:54.73]After jermaEarth gets destroyed by the Clown Star, will its inhabitants migrate to the fabled jermaPluto if any survive?
[323:02.38]No, Jerm Earth is just going on vacation.
[323:04.64]He'll come back stronger than ever, don't worry.
[323:07.74]Uh, Nock.
[323:08.24]Thank you, Nock.
[323:08.70]Welcome back, Nock, for the one dollar.
[323:09.92]They say hey.
[323:10.48]Hey.
[323:10.76]Hi, Nock.
[323:12.78]Neural Shock.
[323:13.40]Thanks for the one buck.
[323:14.14]What do you call a seagull that flies over the bay?
[323:16.85]A bagel.
[323:17.37]Somebody already got that one.
[323:19.43]Somebody already said that, Neural Shock, like a month ago in the seagull stream.
[323:25.19]That is... We gotta get some more seagull jokes.
[323:27.71]Get them out now.
[323:29.68]Wait, was the seagull part of the meme rumble?
[323:32.89]Uh-oh.
[323:35.71]I don't think he was.
[323:38.99]Yeah, it was.
[323:39.57]Oh, yes, it was.
[323:41.45]You know what?
[323:41.75]I forgot he was there because he was literally the worst character behind the Time Serpent.
[323:46.48]I, like, forgot that he even existed.
[323:49.82]But thank you, Neural Shock.
[323:51.80]Thank you, Pin, for the $1.
[323:53.40]Eggs, eggs, crack those eggs.
[323:56.70]That's actually not a bad idea.
[323:57.70]I'm gonna go eat eggs after the stream is over in, like, five minutes.
[324:01.39]Doomed RS, thanks for the five bucks.
[324:04.31]Have you ever heard of Lisa, the painful RPG?
[324:07.59]It's simultaneously the funniest and most depressing game I've ever played.
[324:10.33]And I think your sense of humor would really mesh well with it.
[324:14.41]Any chance you might take a look at it somehow?
[324:15.95]I'm 100% sure it would make for a great stream if you ever find yourself something... without something to play.
[324:23.28]First of all, thank you, Doomed, for the five bucks.
[324:25.08]And I actually have looked at Lisa.
[324:27.80]But the one thing that turned me off from Lisa is...
[324:31.23]It's a lot of reading, right?
[324:34.83]So... Games were... Can I control the outcome of that game?
[324:42.76]Because with Sorcery, that was just reading a whole book to chat, is what that was.
[324:49.02]But we were able to pick and choose things we were doing.
[324:53.44]If it's kind of like that, I don't mind playing games that are a lot of just reading and choices and things.
[325:02.24]I could just do funny voices.
[325:05.30]Yeah, but funny voices can only get you so far.
[325:08.50]I think we can all agree on that.
[325:11.87]It's a great game, but you don't think I would take it seriously.
[325:15.13]Probably not.
[325:17.11]Not saying I would not take it seriously, but I can't guarantee that I would.
[325:23.01]But I will definitely give it another look.
[325:26.14]Thank you to Sunfire for the $1.
[325:27.18]Willy for the $5.
[325:31.09]I remember when I subscribed to you back when I started playing TF2, and you later that day uploaded a video doing bicep curls.
[325:38.61]I somehow didn't leave.
[325:42.73]Very glad I didn't, though.
[325:43.83]You've helped me and plenty of other people to remember that.
[325:47.70]Jerma.
[325:49.80]Thank you, Willy.
[325:52.86]Willy underscore... Thank you for staying after watching that terrible video.
[325:59.42]I don't know what I- like, we've- we've had a couple of comments on that video.
[326:02.54]I don't know why I made that.
[326:04.75]It was the early day- look, me saying this is the equivalent of somebody saying that it was the 80s.
[326:10.15]So that's your excuse, okay?
[326:11.97]Like, oh, wow, holy, you were really fucked up back then.
[326:14.37]It was the 80s.
[326:15.93]Oh, wait, you used to like- you used to like drink milk upside down on Coke?
[326:20.72]It was the 80s.
[326:22.02]Okay, so here- with that in mind, um, it was old YouTube.
[326:28.17]That was like my 80s, you know what I mean?
[326:30.16]Like seven or eight years ago.
[326:32.16]That's like, it was old YouTube.
[326:33.60]It was a wild west.
[326:34.88]And some people just did dumb shit like that for no reason.
[326:37.16]And I cannot give you a reason why I did it.
[326:38.84]It was just old YouTube.
[326:42.33]That was acceptable back in old, like the 80s of YouTube.
[326:49.35]And I used to be huge.
[326:52.29]I was so fit and so full of energy and life.
[326:56.74]And then I stopped working out.
[326:59.06]It's alright.
[327:02.98]Thank you, though.
[327:04.92]Thank you to Lucas7151 for the $15.
[327:07.29]Hey Gerber, what TV shows have you been watching recently?
[327:10.21]Anything to recommend?
[327:13.07]If you were here from the impatient VR stream last week, I just finished watching what is currently available to watch for My Hero Academia.
[327:28.65]It was recommended by some people.
[327:32.12]And, uh... It was good.
[327:35.78]I enjoyed it.
[327:37.64]I can't say it was the best show I've ever watched.
[327:42.44]But I think I just like All Might.
[327:46.48]Oh, by the way, it is the one anime a year quota.
[327:51.70]So, remember, I don't watch more than one anime a year.
[327:56.76]This is my one anime that I'm going to watch.
[327:58.81]This is it.
[327:59.81]It's 2018.
[328:02.07]The cooldown came up and it was My Hero Academia was the anime that I watched.
[328:06.61]Done for a year.
[328:07.27]I don't need to watch any more anime.
[328:08.47]I'll see you next year on my next anime that I can talk about.
[328:11.18]That's a stupid quota.
[328:20.38]I did say no anime on stream.
[328:22.17]We did talk about this.
[328:26.26]So when is All Might gonna be in the Jerma Rumble?
[328:28.48]No, dude, he would, like, kill everybody.
[328:30.30]He's so strong.
[328:33.12]I'm actually mad he chose such a lame anime.
[328:35.63]I don't know.
[328:36.03]Look, I just... Sometimes I scroll.
[328:38.77]I do scrolling.
[328:40.35]And you find something and you click it.
[328:43.25]And you watch it.
[328:43.89]Maybe something's recommended by a friend.
[328:45.19]I did check out JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.
[328:52.18]I did.
[328:55.46]And I might make an exception to watch it.
[329:00.28]All Might is dumb.
[329:01.70]Don't say that.
[329:02.82]I watch like a hundred YouTube videos of him a day.
[329:05.64]Alright, let's go.
[329:13.30]Let's... Watch it on stream.
[329:17.50]I can't watch anime on stream.
[329:19.22]My channel will get terminated.
[329:23.77]But thank you, Lucas, for the 15 bucks.
[329:25.75]Hopefully that answers your question.
[329:26.85]And Eefs, thanks for the $5.
[329:28.07]I was kind of on and off watching the stream tonight because I was playing Tarkov.
[329:33.48]But what you said about TF2, I went back recently after like two years of not playing it.
[329:38.00]It was just utter shell shock getting to play with like the fucking Huntsman and Ambassador again.
[329:45.00]Yeah.
[329:46.76]I will go down on the record to say, quote me on this, please do,
[329:53.69]The Huntsman is the best single addition to any video game that has ever released.
[330:04.36]I mean that.
[330:06.90]I don't care what game, I don't care what year, The Huntsman is the greatest single fucking addition to any game.
[330:16.31]There you go.
[330:27.10]What do you mean you hate me now?
[330:30.26]Just gameplay-wise, just pure gameplay-wise, no one had ever done anything like that.
[330:36.24]Getting a headshot with a Huntsman is so much fun and no one ever did that before.
[330:41.65]There was never a bow and arrow only type weapon that was that good, that was that much fun to use.
[330:51.11]I'm not talking about how easy it is to use or, oh, it's so lucky, the hitboxes are huge.
[330:55.69]I'm just talking pure fun.
[330:58.66]Nobody's ever put a bow and arrow in a video game before that was that much fun.
[331:04.01]Tell me.
[331:06.11]I would love to know if there is another game that you know that has a bow and arrow that's that much fun to use.
[331:14.97]Hanzo?
[331:15.81]Get out of here.
[331:16.59]No.
[331:17.81]Hanzo is not even close to as fun as The Huntsman.
[331:28.90]Because you can do it too fast.
[331:30.08]You know, Hanzo, you can just be like, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, arrows.
[331:35.26]The Huntsman was like, here we go.
[331:41.07]It was so satisfying.
[331:44.13]Far Cry, no, it doesn't even have that.
[331:45.43]It doesn't have the same weight.
[331:46.29]It doesn't have the same gut feel when you're using it.
[331:49.47]It doesn't have the same, getting that like full 360 health point headshot.
[331:53.79]Ah, you can't beat it.
[332:03.93]Enemies just fall over when Hanzo shoots them.
[332:05.89]Yeah, and when you hit the arrow and it would just be like BOOM!
[332:08.98]And you knew you hit it.
[332:09.94]You knew it was a great shot.
[332:11.50]And you walked over and you saw them pinned over to the wall with the arrow sticking out of their ear.
[332:17.11]I would like somebody to find me a more fun to use arrow.
[332:22.13]Bow and arrow.
[332:23.23]I don't think you will.
[332:25.87]Anyways, let's wrap it up here.
[332:28.03]Thank you to MooMeansMoo for the $1.
[332:30.83]I've got feet from my shoes and a head from my hat.
[332:34.21]This is a Christian server and no swears in my chat.
[332:37.60]Otherwise, you were permanently banned.
[332:38.94]Thank you, MooMeansMoo.
[332:40.50]Bob the Pineapple, thanks for the $1.
[332:41.84]Happy birthday, Jerma.
[332:42.64]Thank you.
[332:43.02]It's my birthday every day.
[332:45.00]I am limitless with my birthdays.
[332:48.24]MooMeansMoo again, thanks for the $1.
[332:49.78]All those hours of Minecraft finally paid off for Henry.
[332:52.57]when he received his PhD in architecture and still couldn't afford to buy a house.
[332:56.41]Feels bad, man.
[332:59.63]No, no, no.
[332:59.99]Monster Hunter: World is awesome.
[333:01.23]That game is fucking awesome.
[333:14.58]It is a fantastic game.
[333:17.06]I think... I think the problem I had with Monster Hunter was... Probably streaming it.
[333:24.45]If I'm completely and totally transparently honest.
[333:28.69]I think like the... Some of the...
[333:32.73]Almost like the pressure of knowing what you need to do and making mistakes in front of people that you don't need to be making.
[333:39.98]And the game has a huge learning curve that I think streaming Monster Hunter was probably not the best idea.
[333:49.39]Because when you get frustrated in a game like that, it's hard to do anything else.
[333:54.19]Because if you want to compare it to Dark Souls or Bloodborne or whatever, there's...
[334:01.16]I love streaming those games.
[334:03.96]I have so much fun streaming Dark Souls.
[334:07.26]And Dark Souls-like games, I guess.
[334:10.82]Because, for instance, a boss fight in Dark Souls, even if you die a few times, you still make progress.
[334:22.66]And a boss fight in Dark Souls only takes, like, three to four minutes to do.
[334:28.21]And on the flip side,
[334:30.11]Monster Hunter boss fight is potentially like 20 to 30 minutes long depending like 20 minutes sometimes so making mistakes and fucking up on stream when it's a 20 minute boss fight is like oh god damn it because when you lose in Dark Souls you start right over again and there you go but it's a what about Cuphead
[334:56.79]Cuphead's the same way.
[334:57.55]The content in Cuphead was, you know, like two or three minutes, like five minutes tops for a boss.
[335:06.09]But don't make my attitude on the Monster Hunter streams to give you an indication that I didn't like those games.
[335:13.16]I love Monster Hunter: World.
[335:14.38]I'm playing it off stream a lot.
[335:17.68]It's a fantastic game.
[335:22.12]But I got mad.
[335:23.16]I know.
[335:23.60]I did.
[335:24.04]I'm not gonna lie.
[335:24.82]I did.
[335:25.14]I was.
[335:26.54]It happens, though.
[335:28.00]It happens to the best of us.
[335:31.92]But, uh, with that, thank you to MooMeansMoo for the two bucks.
[335:36.46]Don't ever worry about your streams being anything less than the highlights to our week.
[335:39.57]Love you, Jeremy boy.
[335:40.39]Thank you, Moo.
[335:42.79]I just hope that at least a few times a stream I can have something worth watching sometimes.
[335:49.39]You know, because I think about that a lot.
[335:51.65]Like, was that worth watching?
[335:53.32]Was that fun?
[335:53.96]I don't know.
[335:54.62]Did I have fun?
[335:55.32]I did.
[335:55.96]But did they have fun?
[335:56.94]I don't know.
[335:57.80]Shit.
[336:00.40]Thank you for being here, everybody.
[336:02.26]You guys are all awesome.
[336:04.19]I'll see you tomorrow.
[336:06.49]Take care, everybody.
[336:07.17]We're going to play Subnautica again tomorrow night.
[336:10.73]Much love.
[336:12.25]Have a good one.
[336:13.35]Sleep tight.
[336:14.30]It's probably late for a lot of you guys.
[336:16.26]Good night, everybody.
[336:22.65]you
