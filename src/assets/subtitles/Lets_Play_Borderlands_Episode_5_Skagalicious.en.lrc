[00:11.04]Yeah, right over here, like this.
[00:13.74]Oh, okay, I see.
[00:16.10]I see what you did there.
[00:17.34]God, I wish this music would stop playing.
[00:22.07]That would be useful.
[00:23.69]I feel like I'm in, like, Arabian Nights.
[00:25.91]Wait, what the hell?
[00:27.57]Okay, that was... I think we can cross this bridge, though, can't we, over here?
[00:32.69]Watch out, there's going to be skags coming out right now.
[00:34.43]Yeah, I think we've got to go this way.
[00:37.08]Maybe through this, like, hole, this tunnel?
[00:40.94]Let's watch out for these SCACs.
[00:43.22]God, this SMG is so nice.
[00:46.98]I got SCACs, I got SCACs!

[00:55.06]No, I'm still alive.
[00:57.06]I fell down a little cliff thing though.
[00:58.60]This music is like distracting me.
[01:02.92]I gotta like turn it off.
[01:05.94]See, I fell down.
[01:06.66]I'm coming back up.
[01:08.22]Oh, I got an achievement for Pyro.
[01:11.06]Pyro?
[01:12.58]Yeah.
[01:12.74]And there's a repeater on the ground.

[03:11.92]What's that?
[03:13.51]Finally we get to the bridge.
[03:14.93]Nasty repeater.
[03:16.13]I'm going to take that.
[03:19.15]Come out.
[03:21.24]Oh god, guys, guys, guys.
[03:23.18]Oh, I can see him.
[03:24.04]I'm going to pick him off while you're up there.
[03:33.65]Got to turn around.
[03:35.31]I just don't want to fall down.
[03:37.16]See, I just jump over him.
[03:40.18]Nice shot.
[03:40.76]Yeah, that was a desperate... God, I got a mid-lunge.

[03:50.98]Go, bird.
[03:58.54]Nice.
[03:58.82]I was like, dude, now I need to shoot a bird, too.
[04:02.82]Does the bird go away?
[04:04.26]There's a repeater on the ground, it sucks ass.
[04:07.50]Does that bird go away after a fight?
[04:09.22]Like, how long does he last?
[04:10.22]I gotta, like, look that up.
[04:11.06]Well, he comes back to you, then you need a recharge.
[04:13.74]Ah, okay.
[04:15.86]Apparently you found the data recorder, the first one that we needed.
[04:20.05]Oh, and there's a chest.
[04:21.07]There's a chest.
[04:22.75]Okay.
[04:23.43]Holy shit.
[04:25.84]We have a cheap repeater and we have another nasty repeater.
[04:28.12]I'm just going to take the ammo.
[04:30.60]I'm going to take the blue one.
[04:32.70]I'm taking the blue one.
[04:33.66]You can take the other one if you want.
[04:35.70]I'm good.
[04:37.58]Here, take both.
[04:38.58]I'll just pick them all up.
[04:40.54]Yeah, because then you get more ammo.
[04:44.00]I'm going to equip that right now.
[04:48.75]Yeah, we have to go to the next one now.
[04:51.99]Which is... I don't even know.
[04:53.75]I don't even... This thing's got a scope on it, don't it?
[04:57.32]Ready?
[04:59.06]Are we going?
[05:00.00]Do we go down this way?
[05:01.58]I don't know.
[05:02.02]I don't see any skags walking around, so I think we... Yeah.
[05:05.92]I just don't know where it is.
[05:09.65]Wait, look.
[05:10.15]Maybe... Can we access that area?
[05:13.73]I'm trying to see from like a...
[05:15.26]Maybe if we go, do you see over there?
[05:17.46]On the right?
[05:18.30]Yeah.
[05:18.97]Yep.
[05:19.19]And then we go back around.
[05:20.35]Alright, let's try that.
[05:22.77]Cha-ching!
[05:25.33]I take no fall damage in sexy ninja mode.
[05:28.09]Oh, I took plenty.
[05:30.13]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[05:32.07]Bad idea.
[05:33.28]Bad idea.
[05:34.04]People there?
[05:34.60]Bad idea.
[05:36.86]Ow.
[05:37.24]Oh, skags.
[05:38.04]Ow.
[05:42.18]Oh my god, you spitting bastard.
[05:45.06]Oh, here comes the music again.
[05:47.00]Oh my god.
[05:48.71]I am getting lit up.
[05:49.91]Wow.
[05:52.77]That was bad.
[05:53.31]Yeah, you need health.
[05:56.21]Where you at?
[05:56.85]I'm above you.
[05:58.21]Okay.
[05:58.61]This should be a health pile.
[06:00.57]Let's break these things.
[06:01.20]Maybe there's some health on the ground.
[06:07.52]The shield I have regens health over time.
[06:10.66]What?
[06:11.70]Oh, there's one behind me.
[06:12.80]Spitter.
[06:13.93]I got him.
[06:18.54]Any more?
[06:21.56]That music is still playing, so maybe... You're really low on health.
[06:24.52]Wait, let me chuck a nade over there.
[06:28.95]Oh, he walked right over it.
[06:35.28]That was perfect placement of that grenade.
[06:42.05]dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot dot
[07:09.77]Go bird!
[07:10.45]My bird versus your bird, son.
[07:14.08]Oh, damn.
[07:16.66]My bird versus your bird.
[07:18.76]Look who won.
[07:19.80]Yeah, wait, let him charge me.
[07:22.64]Nice.
[07:22.88]Ow.
[07:22.94]Oh, there's one more.
[07:29.71]There's the last one.
[07:30.63]He's up here.
[07:33.71]He's up above.
[07:34.53]I got him.
[07:37.80]Oh, you going for the sweep?
[07:40.04]Nice shot!
[07:42.82]Yeah, there's a shotgun.
[07:44.72]Terrible shotgun.
[07:46.14]Another one?
[07:46.86]No, I don't want it.
[07:47.58]I already used the terrible shotgun.
[07:51.40]And let me tell you... Oh, no.
[07:52.54]Fall to death type thing over there.
[07:55.67]I know one when I... Oh, here it is.
[07:58.01]Oh, finally.
[08:01.63]Ah, so data recording.
[08:02.73]Oh, wow.
[08:03.95]That was useful.
[08:04.73]So where are we supposed to turn this in?
[08:08.13]TK Baja?
[08:09.71]It says, oh, turned in, but this is like some freak show on like a recording device.
[08:13.65]Yeah, maybe we go up here and over.
[08:21.94]Show for the skags.
[08:23.28]Oh, skags.
[08:25.06]Try and stay up here, because these guys will spit.
[08:31.34]Oh, shit, he jumped up here.
[08:33.54]Yeah, they can, I didn't, he can, wow.
[08:35.66]Watch out, watch out.
[08:36.84]I'm speechless.
[08:41.01]Yeah, watch it there.
[08:41.91]Ready?
[08:43.45]Oh, wow.
[08:44.85]There it goes.
[08:45.53]I didn't even get in the acid.
[08:52.77]I jumped.
[08:53.41]Oh, dude.
[08:54.57]There he is.
[08:55.69]There he is.
[08:56.19]That's the boss.
[08:58.46]We found the boss and we're not even doing that quest.
[09:02.94]Okay.
[09:03.48]Alright.
[09:04.18]I'm whipping grenades up there.
[09:05.70]Careful.
[09:07.82]Oh, eat the grenade.
[09:11.63]Oh man, I'm screwed.
[09:12.91]I gotta get out of here.
[09:15.00]I gotta run.
[09:15.42]Help would be nice.
[09:16.28]I don't think there's any, there's none over here.
[09:18.12]I got him.
[09:19.22]Watch out behind you.
[09:23.98]Okay.
[09:25.24]Is he dead?
[09:27.07]Yeah, I got him out.
[09:28.75]Nice.
[09:29.97]Oh shit, I shouldn't have grabbed that health.
[09:31.47]That was yours.
[09:32.55]It's alright, I regen over time.
[09:34.91]He has a sword in his back and shit.
[09:37.91]Look at this guy.
[09:41.42]He has a sword in his mouth or something?
[09:43.06]I don't even know.
[09:46.90]Oh, hello.
[09:47.58]There's plenty of crates over here.
[09:50.87]What's in that one?
[09:52.65]A bunch of pistol slugs and repeater ammo.
[09:58.97]Oh, another one.
[09:59.57]Weapons.
[10:00.35]What are we going to get?
[10:01.79]Oh, sniper.
[10:02.03]I'll take it.
[10:07.79]I'll take the repeater, too.
[10:09.35]I don't need it.
[10:09.99]That thing's pretty nasty, too.
[10:12.79]Alright, I need to equip this.
[10:15.47]What's the status on our quest?
[10:19.83]Did we finish it?
[10:21.79]We finished TK.
[10:24.11]We killed Scar.
[10:26.03]Yeah, that was the giant skag that we were just fighting.
[10:29.41]And we found his stuff.
[10:32.04]We need to do this, you have this bonehead theft, get the digestruct module from bonehead.
[10:38.61]Oh no, that's the guy we needed to kill that killed us.
[10:41.65]Oh, that's right.
[10:42.67]So what, you think we can take him on now or what?
[10:47.25]Well, I'm level 8.
[10:49.25]I would try and do another one of the quests because there are more just lying around.
[10:53.84]But where do we go from here to get back home?
[11:00.19]Well, maybe if we just follow the diamond.
[11:02.05]I'm assuming it'll bring us back, because that's a... Did you just take health damage?
[11:07.26]I did not take... Whoa, watch out.
[11:09.08]I got him, I got him, I got him.
[11:19.47]Oh boy, I'm running.
[11:20.65]I'm running.
[11:22.75]Be careful.
[11:25.23]Pretty low on health.
[11:31.13]Yeah, I need health the first chance I get.
[11:32.69]Yeah, let me go in front of you.
[11:38.36]Just because if you die, that would not be good.
[11:43.78]Let me just bust these.
[11:44.62]Maybe there's something in there.
[11:47.96]While I have a second, I'm going to turn down the music.
[11:54.81]Oh, we got more skags over here.
[11:58.03]Coming.
[12:06.90]We have a nice viewpoint here.
[12:07.92]Take out the spitter skag.
[12:09.82]Oh, there's a trophy down there.
[12:11.30]Ooh, let's do it.
[12:12.02]Truck made.
[12:17.86]Oh, he ain't got nothing.
[12:20.49]Throwing another one down there.
[12:23.07]I need health.
[12:24.49]Oh, boy.
[12:25.13]Oh, my God.
[12:26.15]They're adapting.
[12:27.93]They're adapting.
[12:29.47]They're coming up the side.
[12:30.51]Go, my bird.
[12:32.88]Do your thing.
[12:35.21]Well, health, health.
[12:37.85]I'm just getting puppet and spit.
[12:40.19]Alright, wait, let me get the kill on him.
[12:41.85]Go for it.
[12:43.05]Because it lets me come back to life.
[12:47.29]Oh, God, I'm almost dead now, too.
[12:48.71]There's one guy up there spitting.
[12:50.67]Up top.
[12:53.31]Oh!
[12:55.88]I just took a... Oh, he's coming at me.
[12:59.50]I'm pretty... Are we both dead?
[13:04.47]There's a health right beside you.
[13:05.65]Watch out.
[13:05.93]Let me just get the kill on this guy.
[13:09.27]Oh, really?
[13:09.75]Oh, no.
[13:09.91]I'm about to be dead.
[13:10.89]Oh, it's because I got the kill from the fire.
[13:13.25]Oh, revive me.
[13:14.04]Revive me.
[13:14.62]Revive me.
[13:16.22]Oh, no.
[13:17.40]Shit, shit.
[13:18.02]There's guys over here.
[13:19.92]Here, just remember to find my position again.
[13:22.60]I'm coming.
[13:22.98]I can see.
[13:23.32]I think you're on the mini map, so I can see you.
[13:27.68]Okay, I got to come around this corner.
[13:35.50]Should be able to find you.
[13:37.42]Okay, yep.
[13:38.42]I can see your, uh... I just got experience from what you just did.
[13:41.03]Go, go, go.
[13:45.39]There you are.
[13:46.01]I'm taking this help that I find in here.
[13:48.15]There you are.
[13:48.51]I need it.
[13:51.59]Where's the little trophy thing?
[13:53.96]We came here for a trophy, yet that is the one thing that I can't find.
[14:01.72]Yeah, well, it was right down here, wasn't it?
[14:04.42]There's a shitty repeater on the ground.
[14:06.00]Did I take it?
[14:08.02]Maybe, you must have.
[14:09.98]Either one of us must have just accidentally picked it up and we were freaking out back there.
[14:13.62]Maybe they're the blade flower seeds that we need and I just picked up one by accident.
[14:18.58]Maybe.
[14:19.16]Because, I mean, I do have two, but... What I really want to do is just get out of here.
[14:25.69]Yeah, let's go turn these in.
[14:27.17]Yeah, we have to go up top and then left.
[14:29.07]Yeah, be careful.
[14:29.87]Shit, there's more guys down there.
[14:31.17]Yeah, we're going like the... Ready?
[14:32.57]Ready?
[14:32.89]Check out that grenade throw.
[14:35.63]Nice.
[14:36.41]Go bird.
[14:36.93]Let's see what he does.
[14:38.94]I'll take that out.
[14:40.28]Nice.
[14:41.04]Oh, what a good boy.
[14:43.02]Watch out.
[14:43.53]We got a spinner on the right over there.
[14:47.59]Critical shot.
[14:51.14]The fire does nice damage.
[14:52.80]Oh, nice.
