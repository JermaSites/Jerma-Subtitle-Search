[00:01.00]Hello everybody!
[00:02.82]Jeremy here with a live commentary and a face cam video.
[00:06.77]Because I know a lot of you guys were asking about this and I've never done this before.
[00:13.07]Let me take that back.
[00:14.29]I have done this before on my live streams and I've done video vlogs before.
[00:18.08]You know the deal.
[00:19.43]But I figured why not just do this because I have a lot of time on my hands.
[00:23.24]So I set up this camera.
[00:26.22]It's like duct taped on a pole sitting on the ground.
[00:29.70]It's just it's ridiculous.
[00:31.82]It actually took me like 25 minutes to set this up.
[00:34.33]So I was kind of raging about that.
[00:37.97]But anyways, let's play some Huntsman Sniper.
[00:40.09]This is on Shibby's server because my server is broken and doesn't work.
[00:44.68]And I don't know if it ever will.
[00:46.08]Who knows?
[00:46.52]I have no idea.
[00:47.94]Trying to fix that as of right now.
[00:49.76]I don't know.
[00:52.08]So let's get started using the Huntsman, the Jurati, and the... What the hell am I using for a knife?
[00:57.75]The Tribalmanship.
[01:00.19]Okay, so let's do it.
[01:02.33]See if I can't get some cool gameplay live, even though that never happens.
[01:05.81]This is on Nightfall.
[01:08.51]Payload Race Nightfall.
[01:10.28]A map that I've played probably three times.
[01:13.89]in my life.
[01:16.05]And I wish people would play it more.
[01:17.77]Because, guys, I'm kind of getting sick of, you know, Dust Bowl, Badwater, you know, they're getting kind of old.
[01:26.15]You know what needs to happen?
[01:27.77]There's got to be an update for Team Fortress 2.
[01:30.55]Because, I'll tell you right now, it's hard to find a server now that doesn't have bots in it.
[01:35.86]The only servers that really aren't running bots anymore, I mean, right now it's 3.30 Eastern Time.
[01:39.90]And
[01:42.38]Every server I've tried to go into is just full of bots, and it's just like, what is going on?
[01:47.06]There has to be some kind of update soon.
[01:49.06]Bring some more people into Team Fortress, make people play.
[01:52.22]I guess, uh, because of Skyrim and, you know, Modern Warfare 3, makes a little bit of sense.
[01:58.41]So, let's get this going.
[02:01.55]Oh, out this window.
[02:04.63]Oh, not in his head.
[02:06.67]He's looking around for me, see that?
[02:08.19]He was like... Oh, no.
[02:13.89]Give me a kill.
[02:16.45]Hello.
[02:16.89]I got the guy behind him.
[02:19.07]I shot at him and I got the guy behind him.
[02:22.19]That didn't make any sense.
[02:25.48]Are we really?
[02:25.98]Wow, we're going to win this game that quick?
[02:29.78]I can't wait to watch that back because I want to see what the hell even just happened right there.
[02:36.94]Nobody on their card except this Pyro.
[02:39.38]No!
[02:40.86]One more second and I would have had him.
[02:43.08]I'll have him right now, though.
[02:45.54]Oh, that was close.
[02:47.59]That was close, alright.
[02:50.23]I need some heals.
[02:50.85]I'm on fire, doctor.
[02:54.01]Nope.
[02:55.51]There's a heavy coming around this corner.
[02:57.95]Nope, not a headshot.
[03:00.71]Oh my god, two heavies.
[03:01.79]Alright, here we go.
[03:08.72]Oh, they're both dead.
[03:10.64]Nice job, team.
[03:12.18]Push that cat.
[03:20.25]Here we go, here we go.
[03:22.37]Oh, this guy's got it out for me.
[03:23.81]Tribe of Wind Shiv!
[03:24.87]Tribe of Wind Shiv!
[03:27.89]Oh god, Kevin!
[03:29.71]Nice!
[03:31.95]That's one way to do it.
[03:33.79]That's one way to do it.
[03:37.54]Get out the Shiv.
[03:38.42]Get out the Shiv and stop smashing people.
[03:45.24]I missed.
[03:46.48]Well, that went well for the first round.
[03:47.90]Let's do another one.
[03:53.20]Get a sip of my water.
[03:57.68]That's right, I said water.
[03:59.86]W-A-T-A-H.
[04:02.16]Water.
[04:04.76]Oh, I'm gonna puke.
[04:08.18]I gotta get out here, man.
[04:09.24]Jesus, what am I doing?
[04:11.34]Oh, this guy's toast.
[04:13.64]Not high enough.
[04:16.13]Not too high.
[04:18.29]There it is.
[04:18.61]It's been a while since I've used the Huntsman.
[04:21.17]So, there it is.
[04:24.29]Get out of my face, Scout!
[04:28.22]Oh, no, get on the car!
[04:31.60]Oh, God.
[04:32.18]Got him right in his face.
[04:34.18]And there is a sniper shooting over here.
[04:36.68]Oh, my God.
[04:37.24]No, that's not a sniper.
[04:37.92]That's a... Speaking of pyro, I didn't even... Speaking of pyro, what am I talking about?
[04:42.94]Oh, I need the Geronimo.
[04:43.62]Come on, come on, come on.
[04:45.89]Did I get us both?
[04:46.55]Nice, I got us both.
[04:51.65]God, I need health.
[04:52.39]I'm gonna get... I'm gonna get sniped.
[04:54.08]Right in the face by a rocket.
[04:57.16]Oh, there it is.
[04:57.62]Come on.
[04:58.50]Heal me.
[04:59.40]Get me up to at least like 70 or 80 before I go anywhere.
[05:03.11]That's good.
[05:04.67]Oh my god.
[05:08.11]No.
[05:09.77]It's alright.
[05:10.07]It's alright.
[05:10.33]We're good.
[05:10.83]Get on the car so I can heal.
[05:13.51]I knew it.
[05:13.97]I knew you were a spy.
[05:17.00]We got anybody?
[05:17.68]We got a medic?
[05:19.54]We do not have a medic.
[05:25.46]Get this guy right here.
[05:26.95]Bang.
[05:28.79]Get this guy right here, too.
[05:31.29]Get down, get down.
[05:32.25]Come on, let's go, cot.
[05:33.55]Let's go.
[05:35.05]That's a spy.
[05:35.99]Spy.
[05:37.77]Oh, we got it.
[05:39.85]We got it.
[05:41.01]Get out of here.
[05:41.85]Get out of here.
[05:42.47]This thing is so weak, we did it.
[05:44.06]We did it.
[05:46.04]Oh, man.
[05:49.10]All right, well, thank you everybody so much for watching.
[05:50.92]I really appreciate it.
[05:52.40]And I'm going to drink the rest of this water on camera.
[05:54.36]I'm going to chug the water.
[05:55.37]Here we go.
[05:55.79]Ready?
[05:56.25]One, two, three.
[06:01.85]I can't do it.
[06:03.69]Oh, I'm going to puke.
[06:05.97]Puke is going to come out of my mouth.
[06:09.32]No, but thanks everybody for watching.
[06:11.02]I really do appreciate it.
[06:11.94]And I'll see you guys all next time.
[06:13.74]Take care, everybody.
