[00:01.00]Let's put on the game.
[00:02.10]Is it already?
[00:02.80]I think it's already open.
[00:05.20]Is it?
[00:06.92]Is it open?
[00:10.90]Hey!
[00:13.52]Duck game.
[00:14.39]Goose game.
[00:15.03]I'm going to keep calling this duck game.
[00:16.49]I'm going to change the title of the stream.
[00:23.59]Well, no.
[00:23.89]Actually, I can keep the title.
[00:28.68]Untitled Goose.
[00:29.54]Alright.
[00:30.02]Is this game actually fun?
[00:33.04]Or what?
[00:37.40]Yes, it is.
[00:38.28]Okay.
[00:39.02]It's very fun, really.
[00:40.14]Is this one of those sleeper hits that everyone's gonna think is like the best game of the whole year?
[00:45.09]Is this one of those scenarios?
[00:45.93]Alright, got my controller.
[00:49.03]I'm ready.
[00:55.05]Hold on, let me get that plugged in.
[00:56.19]Alright, I'm gonna use a controller.
[01:01.99]This is like Goat Simulator.
[01:05.72]Yeah, so in like three years, you guys can rewind back to this stream and laugh at me for my embarrassing Goat Simulator video gameplay.
[01:15.60]Save one.
[01:16.18]We're gonna go here.
[01:27.55]Press B to honk.
[01:34.80]It's Otto!
[01:37.21]Oh, it's already fun.
[01:40.17]Alright, hold A to run.
[01:48.54]Can I get those?
[01:49.56]Is there something I have to do to get them?
[01:54.64]What was that?
[02:08.78]What was that?
[02:13.38]That was Mario.
[02:13.94]You got it.
[02:14.40]Nice work.
[02:15.35]Alright.
[02:15.93]L, T to befriend, to bend forward.
[02:18.53]Okay, so you can crouch.
[02:23.55]Do a sans joke.
[02:31.71]Okay.
[02:32.65]Use your beak.
[02:34.45]X to use beak.
[02:39.06]You can pick stuff up, that's cool.
[02:42.62]No, give me that.
[02:52.89]This is fun.
[02:58.35]This is like, I like this.
[02:59.86]Okay, should I not, do I need any of this stuff?
[03:04.61]Bend down to pick things up off the ground.
[03:06.23]So if it's on the ground, you bend down and just go like that.
[03:08.59]Can I throw?
[03:18.91]Maybe I need to do this.
[03:19.95]Maybe I have to use this like a Rube Goldberg machine?
[03:21.95]I guess not.
[03:30.36]Alright, I think I got it down.
[03:33.40]First puzzle of the game.
[03:38.78]What?
[03:41.18]What am I doing?
[03:41.80]What the fuck did I do?
[03:43.96]I didn't even do anything.
[03:44.89]What?
[03:49.65]Spread your wings?
[03:50.55]Can you fly?
[04:05.54]How do you fly?
[04:12.35]Ooh!
[04:12.93]Food!
[04:13.29]How do I eat the food?
[04:17.19]Can I eat the sandwich?
[04:22.19]I don't think I can.
[04:24.21]Eat it!
[04:29.06]He thinks geese can fly?
[04:30.42]Yes they can.
[04:32.72]They can fly for like a short distance.
[04:37.58]Wait.
[04:40.30]Is somebody hungry?
[04:44.16]I don't know what to do with any of these things.
[04:45.54]What's the goal?
[04:47.62]Zoom in and zoom out.
[04:49.14]Oh, geez.
[04:49.76]Okay.
[04:51.66]What the fuck?
[04:55.57]Wait.
[05:00.67]There's a keyhole.
[05:01.43]There's a lawnmower.
[05:05.47]Can you die?
[05:07.42]Wait.
[05:10.42]Get into the garden.
[05:12.66]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[05:13.52]Get into the garden, get the groundskeeper wet, steal the groundskeeper's keys, make the groundskeeper wear his sun hat, rake in the lake, have a picnic, bring the picnic, blanket, sandwich, apple, pumpkin, carrot, jam, thermos, radio, and basket.
[05:33.89]Okay, get in the garden.
[05:35.07]That sounds easy enough.
[05:37.05]Fly.
[05:43.36]You can't fly.
[05:44.38]You just can spread your wings like a dickhead.
[05:45.96]Okay, got it.
[05:47.24]Let me move the picnic basket.
[05:50.66]I need the picnic basket, the apple, the sandwiches.
[05:57.05]I need it all on the right in the same place.
[05:58.57]So that can stay.
[05:59.73]Let's go this way.
[06:05.53]What if I go up?
[06:12.63]Okay, there's a spot to go this way.
[06:14.01]Alright, I can break in here.
[06:16.49]Can I break in here?
[06:19.17]How do I get that?
[06:27.14]I can't get it.
[06:27.84]I need to stand on something?
[06:32.30]What about this way?
[06:33.00]Alright, I'm in the water.
[06:40.99]Can I go in the pipe?
[06:53.11]I love it.
[06:54.05]It's so cute.
[06:56.45]You can't hate this game.
[06:58.87]I'm trying to find a thing I don't like.
[07:00.39]I can't figure it out yet.
[07:04.81]You just exist.
[07:08.53]Ooh, what's that?
[07:12.30]I'm gonna go all the way up.
[07:13.02]This is huge!
[07:15.70]There's a lot of stuff over here.
[07:16.84]Alright, hold on.
[07:21.40]Is it a baby binky?
[07:28.97]What do I do with the binky?
[07:31.27]Is there a baby that needs this?
[07:40.78]Okay, what am I supposed to do with this stuff?
[07:48.72]Oh, shit.
[07:50.20]Do I need those boots for anything?
[07:51.26]Alright, I think I need to collect the two boots.
[08:01.70]Can I open this door?
[08:07.50]Can somebody come open the door for me?
[08:09.18]Alright, I'm gonna take the baby binky.
[08:12.32]I think I'm gonna need it.
[08:13.60]Because there's gonna be a baby that I have to give this to, probably.
[08:29.64]Jerma geese don't help people.
[08:32.30]This one does.
[08:32.88]I get to be my own goose.
[08:38.84]And I want to be a friendly goose.
[08:40.26]Wait, I'm going to go down.
[08:40.90]Where does this actually end up, is what I want to know.
[08:50.34]Nothing down here.
[08:53.78]What was that?
[08:57.33]Why do I hear bells?
[08:59.52]Bells, bells, bells.
[09:00.94]Why?
[09:07.26]It's Anor Londo.
[09:09.68]Alright, I brought a binky back, but this doesn't help me at all.
[09:16.66]What can I go?
[09:17.58]I can't get up here.
[09:29.14]Get in the garden.
[09:32.24]What's this?
[09:32.54]Turn it off.
[09:36.77]Where's the gardener?
[09:39.37]You wouldn't go over there?
[09:58.23]I would be like, there's somebody in a well somewhere.
[10:00.59]This is some Lassie shit.
[10:02.81]Are people friendly?
[10:38.61]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, turn it on!
[10:41.21]Turn it on!
[10:53.50]Wait, wait!
[10:56.16]I gotta get the key, he's got a key on his back.
[11:01.49]This is so stupid.
[11:09.51]I'm like sneaking behind him.
[11:11.16]Oh shit.
[11:28.61]I wish there was a piss button.
[11:29.87]I don't know why, I just kind of do.
[12:08.25]Give me that fucking key Give me the key
[12:17.01]I'm gonna sneak around.
[12:17.89]Alright.
[12:21.15]Fuck!
[12:21.52]I had a... Here it is.
[12:36.35]Here it is.
[12:37.13]Here it is!
[12:37.93]It's mine now!
[12:45.70]How can you water without the thing you need to water?
[12:48.27]Hold on, he's got like a knife.
[13:08.57]I love this.
[13:09.57]It's just so... It's just a cute game.
[13:13.29]You know what is adorable?
[13:15.85]Try to backstab him?
[13:17.51]You can't kill people in this game.
[13:27.92]He's chasing me!
[13:34.91]He's faster than me!
[13:35.63]He's faster than me!
[13:36.23]He's faster than me!
[13:36.79]Fly!
[13:37.53]Fly fly fly fly fly!
[13:39.85]No!
[13:50.82]Come on, I have to make it!
[13:51.86]I have to make...
[14:04.42]Okay, I gotta get the keys.
[14:11.15]They really nailed how geese move around too.
[14:15.07]I got it!
[14:18.56]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick!
[14:19.72]This kind of shit was on PBS, man.
[14:32.06]There's no dialogue, but there is.
[14:44.06]What do I do with this?
[14:47.54]Make the groundskeeper wear his sun hat.
[14:50.36]Rake in the lake, have a picnic.
[14:57.10]How do I make him wear his sun hat?
[15:08.14]Those are his boots.
[15:08.74]Alright, what does he have here?
[15:09.52]Alright, let's just hide this so he'll never find them.
[15:13.84]No, that's okay.
[15:14.54]What is this dude?
[15:15.10]Is this jam?
[15:26.43]Is this a bathroom?
[15:46.77]I'm just like a fucking asshole.
[15:54.69]Oh, he found the keys.
[15:55.55]Good for you.
[15:57.09]Breaking the lake.
[15:58.10]Breaking the lake.
[16:06.10]What?
[16:07.26]Hey.
[16:18.36]I can get up here, too.
[16:19.16]Okay.
[16:27.50]Can I... Can I not fly over this?
[16:29.26]I have to get the rake into the lake.
[16:32.80]No, I gotta hat... Where's his sun hat?
[16:33.90]He's got a hat somewhere.
[16:38.50]Is this his hat up here?
[16:39.23]No, I think that's a brick.
[16:44.11]Hold on.
[16:55.37]Can I do this?
[17:27.75]I had it too.
[17:28.51]I was propping myself up.
[17:35.62]Get up there.
[17:36.24]I know I can do it.
[17:42.34]Damn it.
[17:48.11]It's gotta be right there.
[17:48.85]I just have to be able to reach it, right?
[18:13.15]You saw this shit.
[18:14.45]Oh, you backyard window.
[18:17.01]I would definitely think that this was a Rick Moranis movie where he was transported into a goose.
[18:34.83]I can take these two away.
[18:35.65]Can I... I can help.
[18:58.58]This is not true to character.
[18:59.74]I told you I wanted to do, like, a fun character that helped.
[19:03.42]In the children's book that this would be a part of, they would be counting these right now.
[19:12.06]There.
[19:12.40]See?
[19:13.84]Where's the barking?
[19:18.60]Oh, sorry.
[19:19.84]Alright, how do I... I need to wear his sun hat.
[19:47.97]Give me the keys!
[19:49.63]I got the keys!
[19:56.99]How do I get the sun hat?
[20:14.63]Give that back!
[20:15.39]I need that!
[20:18.75]Get up!
[20:19.07]What the fuck are you doing?
[20:21.92]Leave me alone!
[20:22.64]I'm just trying to get the fu- Alright.
[20:29.86]I'm running.
[20:43.85]Jump over the gate with the rake.
[20:45.73]It might be possible.
[20:59.52]Alright, can I bring the chair?
[21:08.37]I don't think I can drag the chair, guys.
[21:10.09]Okay, I want to see what he does.
[21:31.54]Oh, okay, hold on.
[21:33.03]Get this out of the way.
[22:24.10]Oh, fucking fine!
[22:25.02]Take it!
[22:25.44]Just give me your... Wait a minute.
[22:35.67]Can I get on top of this?
[22:42.91]Just bite him.
[22:44.31]He leans down over there.
[22:45.79]I think I just need to stealthily sneak up behind him and take his hat.
[22:52.01]Yeah, I'm going for the hat.
[22:53.75]I'm gonna hide in the fucking cabbage.
[23:07.90]I just did that because I felt like it.
[23:10.20]There's no other reason.
[23:11.38]Alright, is he coming back?
[23:16.56]What's he doing?
[23:17.87]Alright, he's got the soil.
[23:18.79]What's he doing with the soil?
[23:28.36]He's getting... He's moving the bucket.
[23:32.92]Now he's getting the pail.
[23:39.67]What is he doing?
[23:44.71]He's burying bodies.
[23:49.55]I don't think... This is a garden, man.
[23:51.09]What are you talking about?
[23:52.23]Does he have to lean down for that?
[23:59.06]No, he's got to do something.
[24:02.62]Can he see me?
[24:03.46]Oh shit, he can see me.
[24:07.60]Perfect for bodies.
[24:11.42]So what is he... I need you to lean down.
[24:15.65]Go garden somewhere.
[24:37.86]Oh shit, I had it.
[24:39.34]I had it.
[24:40.74]That was so rude.
[24:42.58]Hold on.
[24:45.37]Throw it into the lake.
[24:48.99]Look, you can have this back.
[24:53.99]He's bald.
[24:54.79]Yeah, that's not a hat, that's a toupee.
[25:10.93]I got it.
[25:16.70]Can I run this over the lawnmower?
[25:24.54]Aha!
[25:24.98]There it is.
[25:25.44]He puts it on.
[25:28.51]Rake in the lake.
[25:30.39]You got it.
[25:30.75]I got to steal it this way so he doesn't see me.
[26:08.07]I can't take that hat.
[26:10.35]Never mind.
[26:21.34]Rake in the lake.
[26:22.26]Here it goes.
[26:22.86]Oh, there's the picnic.
[26:28.02]The picnic is right here.
[26:28.76]A new to-do list item has shown up.
[26:53.78]Come on!
[26:57.66]Here we go.
[26:58.54]Hold on, I have an idea.
[26:59.36]Can I get it up there?
[27:04.45]If I can turn this, this might work.
[27:14.01]Come on, vault over this fence!
[27:19.23]Now he's just flexing.
[27:22.36]To who?
[27:22.86]There's nobody watching.
[27:25.56]Doesn't a flex require somebody else to flex on?
[27:28.26]It's alright, I'll just leave it in the lake.
[27:33.81]Alright, have a picnic.
[27:34.79]Make the groundskeeper hammer his thumb.
[27:37.91]Alright, let's get a picnic going first.
[27:46.92]There's the apple.
[27:52.26]Streamer hates his viewer.
[27:53.36]Wait, what?
[27:53.66]What are you talking about?
[27:54.30]What did I do?
[27:54.66]Uh, I said, highway to backsplash.
[27:59.78]Thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[28:02.63]From a little earlier.
[28:03.41]Thank you.
[28:05.65]5,000 bits.
[28:07.15]$50 coming in from highway to backsplash, they said.
[28:09.91]Jeremy, you completely outdid yourself with the carnival stream.
[28:12.81]However, I was disappointed to see that you didn't put your middle finger out the window during the clown car crash like you promised.
[28:23.14]It's alright, though.
[28:23.80]It still happened.
[28:25.58]Who's calling me?
[28:30.85]I have no idea who this is.
[28:33.37]And when we don't know, we button.
[28:43.25]Alright.
[28:44.81]Now I need... Blanket, pumpkin... Oh, right.
[28:47.83]I gotta go back to this garden and get the pumpkins and shit.
[28:52.81]That was rude.
[28:53.37]I don't know.
[28:54.99]I don't know who that is.
[28:55.67]It's probably a scammer.
[29:11.17]Alright.
[29:12.01]Carrot.
[29:12.67]Pumpkin Jam.
[29:14.07]Thermos Radio.
[29:15.27]I gotta take all this guy's stuff.
[29:20.79]Just take one of each.
[29:24.96]Wait, is he?
[29:25.38]He knew I took one.
[29:26.06]How did you count them?
[29:27.16]How did you know I took one?
[29:29.05]Is he going to the picnic to take... Wait a minute.
[29:31.65]He's not actually going to do that, is he?
[29:36.39]Get out of here.
[29:43.11]What's more important?
[29:43.81]What's more important?
[29:44.39]Pumpkin or the rose.
[29:45.89]Oh, yeah?
[29:47.41]So I'll just take this thing then.
[30:14.77]My dog does this shit.
[30:17.67]Hey, give me that back.
[30:18.64]No, give me this.
[30:19.46]And then he'll grab something else completely unrelated and run away.
[30:24.12]He has like a toy.
[30:24.86]Hey, give me that toy.
[30:26.90]Okay, fine.
[30:27.30]I'll take this.
[30:28.67]Wait, I got it.
[30:42.66]Alright, I gotta steal.
[30:43.33]I gotta get... Pumpkin's gonna be hard to get.
[31:09.30]Now, this would be cute if I invite him to the picnic afterwards, right?
[31:14.87]That's the last panel of the book.
[31:19.79]And he goes, What is it?
[31:21.61]What happened?
[31:22.31]These are my things!
[31:23.15]These are my things!
[31:25.81]No!
[31:26.43]Okay.
[31:30.47]Picnic blanket and I need jam.
[31:35.85]That's jam, right?
[31:37.43]And a thermos.
[31:48.97]This is a big picnic.
[31:49.77]Alright, thermo- I think this is- I gotta make that look nicer than it does.
[31:56.71]It looks terrible right now.
[31:59.47]Wait, and his toupee.
[32:07.27]And the rose.
[32:08.00]No, I'm not gonna do that.
[32:09.22]It's weird.
[32:13.90]Where's the picnic blanket?
[32:23.91]You have a sign that says no ducks, but I've been here the whole time.
[32:26.75]Just hanging out.
[32:31.99]Why would you not be freaking out that I'm in here yet?
[32:36.24]How do I get up there?
[32:39.60]There it is.
[32:53.67]Don't certain animals do this shit though?
[32:57.03]There's an animal that actually comes and steals stuff from your house.
[33:03.17]What is it?
[33:03.51]Alright, I need the radio and picnic blanket.
[33:10.12]Crows?
[33:11.82]They'll take, like, bracelets, jewelry.
[33:16.62]What is in here?
[33:18.20]I can hide in this.
[33:29.22]Good luck finding this.
[33:31.74]Oh, what?
[33:32.14]How did you find that?
[33:32.80]Alright, where's the blanket?
[33:36.08]Picnic blanket.
[33:36.96]Here's the radio.
[33:53.14]Can I not pick the radio up?
[33:55.52]Okay, well, this works.
[34:08.22]Wow, this is the blanket.
[34:09.64]Alright.
[34:11.32]Bring to the picnic blanket.
[34:13.58]Make the groundskeeper hammer his thumb.
[34:22.89]How do I do that?
[34:25.82]How do I get him to hammer anything?
[34:36.14]That duck.
[34:39.04]Is he doing like an AI loop?
[34:40.50]Is he going to pick the hammer up?
[34:48.38]Wait.
[35:00.79]How do I get him to hammer his thumb?
[35:01.79]Do I have to scare him before he swings?
[35:04.27]No, look what I did.
[35:14.68]What?
[35:14.92]No, this is working way better than I want it to.
[35:17.62]Come, look over here!
[35:18.80]I thought I checked it over here.
[35:26.95]Alright, you know what?
[35:33.71]I'm just gonna let him finish what he's doing.
[35:41.56]He'll see it eventually.
[36:07.11]Was he gonna hammer the shoe?
[36:09.61]What are you doing, man?
[36:11.19]Alright, this is it.
[36:19.72]This is it.
[36:20.52]Ready?
[36:21.72]He's gonna hammer.
[36:22.26]I'm gonna scare him right before he swings.
[36:40.89]That was really hard.
[36:42.14]That was really hard.
[36:51.20]He... That's not a broken thumb.
[36:53.71]That is a shattered hand.
[36:57.69]He was aiming for his hand.
[36:58.95]Alright, I did it.
[37:02.19]Nice.
[37:02.83]Alright, now what?
[37:06.68]I did it all.
[37:12.03]Level 2.
[37:12.51]Oh, yeah.
[37:14.79]Nice.
[37:15.09]That's awesome.
[37:15.65]Alright, let's go.
[37:18.69]Shortcut?
[37:21.81]Dammit.
[37:22.13]It's a shortcut.
[37:22.65]I can't do anything.
[37:30.37]Turn on the radio.
[37:37.66]Okay.
[37:38.42]I'll turn the radio on.
[38:09.41]Hey, what?
[38:09.87]I was doing something.
[38:12.82]Hey!
[38:14.74]I was doing a thing.
[38:15.56]I was walking with the music.
[38:18.16]How dare you.
[38:20.22]Get that back.
[38:38.29]He's drinking the water.
[38:39.09]He's scared of water.
[38:42.39]Did I break it?
[38:44.61]Oh, fuck!
[38:56.18]All my stuff!
[38:57.46]My rose!
[38:58.88]My rake!
[39:00.44]Everything is in here!
[39:09.89]Alright, it'll dry.
[39:11.49]Right?
[39:18.56]No!
[39:18.90]Get the fuck out of here!
[39:19.76]I'm trying to do something!
[39:33.33]Look, I have a rake.
[39:33.99]I have a rake.
[39:36.83]Don't you want to take that rake back?
[39:40.11]Yes.
[39:40.67]Get that rake out of here.
[39:41.85]Good for you.
[39:43.45]Just give me this fucking thing.
[39:44.45]I'm just gonna get away from him.
[39:53.14]He needs this clip for the second Jermbo video.
[39:56.32]Now somebody gets it!
[39:59.60]I need at least five seconds of a transitional piece.
[40:04.15]Wait, he's gonna see.
[40:08.43]Well, he remembers the rose.
[40:12.40]Alright, see you later.
[40:15.97]Okay.
[40:17.53]Here we go.
[40:19.37]Here's the edit point. ...
[40:55.41]I need a new song.
[40:55.99]This song's hard to time.
[41:02.93]Wait, it's a new person.
[41:04.83]I gotta say hello.
[41:13.18]There it is.
[41:13.50]Here's the... This is Halloween.
[41:37.69]There it is.
[41:38.34]End transitional piece.
[41:39.18]Ooh, new stuff!
[41:43.98]Break the broom.
[41:45.50]Trap the boy in the phone booth.
[41:49.00]Oh, okay, that's easy.
[41:53.07]I just have to push the ball into the phone booth.
[41:57.37]Boy has glasses on, by the way.
[41:58.75]Alright, what else?
[41:59.79]Make the boy wear the wrong glasses.
[42:01.47]Make someone buy back their own stuff.
[42:03.61]Get on TV.
[42:04.65]Go shopping.
[42:06.89]Okay.
[42:07.91]Break the... Whisper him.
[42:09.95]That's important.
[42:10.52]That's the first thing.
[42:21.42]Make boy put on new glasses.
[42:23.24]Wait.
[42:23.40]Can I steal his favorite toy?
[42:26.69]Yeah.
[42:27.05]Just shatter this thing.
[42:29.87]Okay.
[42:30.19]Wait.
[42:33.95]Wait.
[42:43.51]She's got a weapon.
[42:44.37]She's got a weapon.
[42:44.91]They have weapons.
[42:46.37]Okay.
[42:47.47]They actually fight back.
[42:51.94]Break the broom.
[42:53.10]Okay.
[43:29.98]I did what I wanted to do.
[43:30.70]Uh oh.
[43:40.76]Yeah, let's go.
[43:41.76]You wanna fuck with me?
[43:42.50]I am unhittable!
[43:49.26]It's like Oscar the Grouch.
[43:51.95]Get over here.
[43:52.51]Let's go.
[44:09.33]This is not working.
[44:10.33]This is not doing what I want.
[44:14.97]There's nobody around here?
[44:15.85]Oh, well.
[44:22.95]Apple!
[44:29.26]What else is in here?
[44:32.62]Oh!
[44:33.06]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[44:34.30]There's a toothbrush in here.
[44:39.06]Can I do something with the toothbrush?
[44:47.82]Can I mail the toothbrush?
[44:49.02]I don't know who I would mail it to, but I could mail it to somebody.
[44:53.60]Should I put it in the mail?
[44:58.90]Is that in the game, or is that in real life?
[45:01.59]Alright, here's the shopping cart.
[45:06.17]I gotta... Okay, this...
[45:14.80]This is a nightmare for this kid.
[45:19.98]Wait, wait, wait.
[45:21.07]I need to hold on.
[45:22.07]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[45:53.08]Overconfident stride.
[45:54.42]Alright, I get in the phone booth.
[46:02.65]How do I... He'll run in the phone booth if he's scared of me.
[46:10.27]This way.
[46:10.57]No, no, no.
[46:12.99]Over here.
[46:14.03]Over here, over here, over here.
[46:16.51]Into the phone booth.
[46:19.55]Yeah.
[46:21.21]You bet you're scared, huh?
[46:22.97]I bet you're scared.
[46:43.65]Oh, fuck!
[46:52.56]I should call the police on a bird.
[47:00.38]Another thing to look out your window and see, yeah.
[47:03.01]That's odd.
[47:03.53]Alright, am I safe?
[47:05.25]I think I'm safe.
[47:14.54]Okay, so now, make the boy wear the wrong glasses.
[47:17.48]Let me, I gotta observe the boy.
[47:18.62]Okay, he checks his glasses.
[47:29.69]And then he walks over here.
[47:30.39]He plays with the ball for a little while, right?
[47:54.40]He brings the ball over here.
[47:57.66]He wipes his mouth.
[47:59.41]And he kicks the ball.
[48:05.77]I think I have to explore a little bit more.
[48:07.03]Because he checks his glasses.
[48:08.75]What else is there?
[48:09.47]Make someone buy back their own stuff.
[48:13.45]Is it broom?
[48:16.43]Alright, so I'm thinking... I have to go shopping, so... Where's the checkout counter?
[48:25.44]He's got the toy, too.
[48:27.90]Rake and bucket.
[48:29.90]No, I don't need the rake.
[48:30.80]What do I need the rake for?
[48:37.31]I'm just walking through.
[48:43.77]Wait, you don't know where the room is?
[48:45.09]Alright, I'm gonna keep exploring.
[48:46.69]I'm opening the garage.
[48:51.98]Keep going this way.
[48:52.70]There's the trash can.
[48:54.00]There's these walkie-talkies.
[48:57.85]Wait a minute.
[49:07.82]Okay, so let's put these.
[49:16.82]Maybe I can trick the lady?
[49:18.04]I'm putting it down here.
[49:28.89]Okay, maybe I can make the lady think there's a goose over there.
[49:36.03]This is Metal Gear.
[49:40.29]Kind of.
[49:41.51]Except not really.
[49:43.25]It's a... I don't know what the hell is wrong with my brain.
[49:46.99]But I was gonna say it's not... It's no snake.
[49:51.11]No shit.
[50:00.37]Did it work?
[50:01.93]Okay, it worked.
[50:02.67]Now what?
[50:04.27]Uh, take the radio.
[50:05.55]Just take something.
[50:06.43]Break something.
[50:07.29]Okay?
[50:08.81]Give me this.
[50:09.11]I don't know what this is, but give it to me.
[50:18.23]Okay, now, um... No, listen over here.
[50:26.82]Stole the cash register.
[50:28.10]Yeah, so I can unplug that.
[50:30.42]Glasses!
[51:15.13]Got it.
[51:20.53]How do I give these glasses to the kid?
[51:22.59]Give me $20, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[51:28.02]Thank you for the 10 community subs.
[51:29.98]Give me $20.
[51:33.24]How do I break... How do I break his glasses?
[51:41.20]Can he run to the pole or something and smash his glasses?
[51:55.29]He does have big shoelaces.
[51:57.99]No, I don't do that, do I?
[51:59.43]Are you kidding me?
[52:03.51]Do I have to sneak up and tie this person's shoelaces up?
[52:11.22]When do I have a chance to do that?
[52:30.19]Wait, what?
[52:30.57]I can hit him in the head?
[52:42.68]Pinman just gave 10 community subs too.
[52:44.32]Thank you, Pinman.
[52:58.73]Back to back, both of you.
[52:59.77]I figured it out.
[53:00.95]Wait.
[53:04.79]Haha!
[53:14.26]No, get in!
[53:14.74]Let's get in here!
[53:27.30]Quick, run!
[53:28.22]Get out!
[53:28.72]Get out, quick!
[53:35.53]Leaving the scene of a crime.
[53:38.07]How do I break the broom?
[53:47.61]Run from your sins.
[53:54.43]Have the kid fall on the broom.
[54:00.11]Has he still not figured it out?
[54:01.48]Are those the right glasses?
[54:17.52]No, that's not gonna work.
[54:29.58]Make him run on the rake head.
[54:32.36]You guys are sick.
[54:41.99]I should boost him out of the map.
[54:46.97]Get the fuck out of here!
[54:49.80]I'm busy.
[54:54.84]What?
[54:58.08]I'm gonna sneak in.
[55:29.65]Open the door!
[55:30.45]How do I break it?
[55:43.80]I can't, like, wedge it in a door or something?
[55:56.02]Call the police or something!
[56:02.31]Alright, I don't know how to break it.
[56:06.64]I still need to go shopping.
[56:07.88]Alright, I'm thinking buy a toy.
[56:13.88]Like a scanner?
[56:18.29]She just scanned these items.
[56:20.71]Alright, let me... She put a price tag on it.
[56:22.87]Where's her scanner?
[56:33.24]I have to go up and weigh it?
[56:39.36]I just wanna go shopping.
[57:00.57]So that's how you weigh stuff, but how do I- can I print a receipt?
[57:13.44]No, shit, I wanna- No!
[57:26.11]Am I overco- wait, do I just leave with an item?
[57:29.71]Am I?
[57:32.35]Make the shock scales go ding.
[57:36.44]What?
[57:40.58]Get on TV.
[57:42.96]Get on TV?
[57:45.21]How do I get on TV?
[57:46.21]Is there a camera?
[57:51.05]Where's the camera?
[57:58.20]I demand to be put on television!
[58:00.12]Hmm.
[58:00.28]Put me on TV.
[58:29.67]There's a button right there.
[58:30.57]Alright, I need to get the police called.
[58:33.99]Because I've got to press the button over there.
[58:35.23]You're going to call the store.
[58:39.61]The guy comes out.
[58:40.21]I press the button.
[58:40.78]Get on TV.
[58:41.20]We got it.
[58:41.78]Open the door.
[59:18.36]You can go in.
[59:18.96]No!
[59:48.76]I was trying to get... That's what I call them!
[60:28.38]You get in there too!
[60:48.54]Prop the door open with the broom?
[60:49.58]Would that work?
[61:07.03]And I'm over here too!
[61:49.72]I don't think I'm fast enough to get in here.
[61:51.24]I think I do have to prop the door.
[61:56.32]Because every time I run over there, it's too... Let's try it again.
[62:04.99]Get in here.
[62:09.77]No, you went the wrong way.
[62:14.45]Get in that telephone booth.
[62:17.19]Oh my god.
[62:19.27]Move out of the way.
[62:20.37]The lady's been looking for a broom.
[62:21.99]Go in the booth.
[62:24.53]Where's the walkie-talkie?
[62:27.90]I'm putting it over, like, right at here.
[62:30.14]Come on.
[62:44.18]Get in the phone booth, now.
[62:49.28]I just want to turn the T... No, stop, stop, stop.
[62:51.22]There you go, there you go, there you go.
[62:56.16]Good.
[62:57.02]Haha.
[63:00.45]Let's walkie-talkie.
[63:10.01]What the fuck is going on right now?
[63:15.48]I can't go in!
[63:16.09]She blocks the door!
[63:16.83]I can't go in!
[63:17.47]The door's blocked!
[63:18.43]Don't you understand?!
[63:19.51]When she walks out, I can't go by her!
[63:55.67]What?
[63:57.95]Get off the TV, quick!
[64:30.37]How do I break the broom?
[64:50.86]I would like to pay for an item, please.
[64:54.42]That weapon's better.
[64:56.20]That's a better weapon.
[64:59.62]Alright, let me ring this up real quick.
[65:03.02]There's no padding on it anymore.
[65:08.32]Uh-oh.
[65:11.58]This is not good.
[65:12.28]I think I'm stuck.
[65:17.66]Yeah, I'm stuck.
[65:19.24]My head's being squished into the door.
[65:25.18]Okay, make someone buy back their own stuff.
[65:29.93]Put in the basket.
[65:30.73]Two... I'm overthinking it.
[65:32.59]I'm overthinking it.
[65:33.25]I'm overthinking it.
[65:33.77]I didn't even read the instructions.
[65:37.15]What an idiot.
[65:37.97]I didn't even read the instructions.
[65:44.86]That in the basket?
[65:47.34]Okay.
[65:50.06]Loom paper.
[65:50.98]Hairbrush.
[65:51.60]I need toilet paper.
[66:00.87]What else?
[66:01.69]Hairbrush, food... I was trying to scan objects.
[66:07.65]Okay, hairbrush, food, cleaner, fruit, and vegetable.
[66:10.98]Does that count as a... That's a fruit and vegetable.
[66:24.77]Okay, cleaner, food, hairbrush.
[66:29.73]Cleaner?
[66:35.19]How did you fix the broom?
[66:41.07]Uh-oh.
[66:44.07]I think the jig is up.
[66:44.85]She saw my shopping cart.
[66:47.83]No!
[66:49.25]Give that back!
[67:00.99]Oh, fuck.
[67:01.35]I have to... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[67:04.59]Put...
[67:08.88]She doesn't know where I am Don't make any noise No!
[67:32.60]Why did I do that?
[67:33.48]That was really stupid
[67:42.84]I would be a very bad villain.
[67:44.80]It would be terrible.
[67:52.28]Oh, shit.
[67:53.44]I gotta move this out of the way.
[67:58.73]If my plan works for even a tenth of a second, I would just start laughing.
[68:03.01]Like that.
[68:06.96]That's a Scooby-Doo villain.
[68:08.10]Yeah, that is a Scooby-Doo villain.
[68:09.79]Alright, what else do I need?
[68:12.09]Cleaner, hairbrush.
[68:15.51]Where's the hairbrush?
[68:18.33]Up here?
[68:18.81]I don't know.
[68:20.65]Is that a hairbrush?
[68:33.48]Cleaner's up on the rack.
[68:40.15]This is cleaner, right?
[68:41.35]Is this cleaner?
[68:41.91]Where'd she go?
[68:46.63]Hey!
[68:47.23]She went back and took her orange.
[68:49.27]No.
[68:56.40]You can't get in... I'm sorry, but if you find this, if you own a store, and you find this basket with these random objects, this is a baby came in with their parents, and they did their I'm pretending to shop.
[69:08.63]You wouldn't do anything about that.
[69:09.73]You'd pick it up later.
[69:11.87]No one's getting in trouble here.
[69:12.83]I don't have enough room.
[69:24.68]No.
[69:25.28]Get back in there.
[69:27.71]Good.
[69:28.69]Hairbrush.
[69:29.11]I need a fruit.
[69:33.66]Go get the broom.
[69:35.50]Fight me.
[69:35.90]Let's go.
[69:37.72]No.
[69:38.30]Fight me.

[69:40.54]You want to go?

[69:43.83]Let's go then.

[69:54.09]That's what I thought.
[69:58.30]Go get that broom!
[70:02.15]I'll bite the fucking thing in half!
[70:07.63]You... Bitch!
[70:11.25]That was rude.
[70:18.26]It's like... Now I'm like... I'm supposed to be playing a nice person.
[70:22.58]You already did that.
[70:23.90]You give me an option to move a mouth by pressing a button.
[70:26.26]I'll do it every time.
[70:26.96]I don't care.
[70:35.01]I see the... Where's the... I don't... I do not see a hairbrush.
[70:38.70]I'm not kidding.
[70:41.86]Hairbrush.
[70:44.28]Glasses, umbrellas.
[70:47.31]Toilet paper, fruits, vegetables.
[70:55.38]Oh.
[70:56.78]I mean, that's... That's so... That blends in.
[71:01.31]It literally does.
[71:01.97]Oh, it literally does.
[71:03.81]It literally blends in.
[71:04.95]This is like a bath... This is a shower scrubber.
[71:18.70]Oh, you're really going to chase me all the way over here, huh?
[71:25.32]You're leading her to the stash.
[71:26.94]Not on purpose.
[71:32.94]There's the bait.
[71:34.24]Will she take it?
[71:34.96]Yes, she will.
[71:39.01]Idiot.
[71:43.19]Well, I mean, it would have been smart, but I didn't get back here fast enough.
[71:45.85]Hold on.
[71:47.27]Take the bait.
[71:55.54]Come over here.
[71:56.26]I'm dropping oil behind my car.
[72:09.31]Quick.
[72:09.55]It's too heavy.
[72:14.15]It's too heavy.
[72:16.72]I gotta get the last item.
[72:35.76]Does she know what that is?
[72:37.48]No, she doesn't.
[72:38.28]How would she know what that is?
[72:43.29]What is... No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[72:47.75]Yeah!
[72:50.37]I'm not gonna do it.
[73:00.54]Absolutely scrumptious.
[73:03.06]Alright, what's next?
[73:05.26]Trap the shopkeeper in the garage.
[73:07.02]I don't understand how to make somebody buy back their own stuff then.
[73:16.24]Oh.
[73:19.33]Wait, I have a new place I can be in?
[73:22.95]Can I get out?
[73:45.27]What is she looking for?
[73:46.09]What is that?
[73:46.51]What is she looking for?
[73:51.89]What?
[73:52.38]What is that?
[73:52.80]A chalk?
[73:54.52]Oh.
[73:56.24]It says no geese.
[74:14.01]This is, like, scary.
[74:15.55]Alright, I did it.
[74:16.51]She's trapped.
[74:20.25]Now, make someone buy back their own stuff.
[74:25.30]Buy back their own stuff.
[74:33.14]Should I put a price tag on his glasses?
[74:40.92]Wait, he always wants to play with this, so let's put a prize tag on this.
[74:44.38]This is my store now.
[74:56.12]Wait, hold on.
[75:05.55]And I can't get like a prize tag on it?
[75:11.45]Oh no, I need the shopkeeper.
[75:13.13]Because I put this in here and then he looks for it and then she makes him buy it.
[75:17.45]Can I let her out?
[75:23.84]Wait, she got out?
[75:27.56]What?
[75:28.57]You can just leave.
[75:41.35]Oh, how do we open the door?
[75:51.95]Get out!
[76:17.47]Should I grab the chalk?
[76:20.39]Alright, I have the chalk now.
[76:24.55]Look.
[76:30.58]Open the door, please.
[76:32.80]The trash can is blocking her, is it?
[76:54.36]Hey, it worked.
[76:57.42]She was getting blocked by the trash can.
[77:01.18]Alright.
[77:04.60]I'm stuck in the pole.
[77:06.52]You saw that.
[77:07.32]You saw that close up.
[77:13.49]Here we go.
[77:14.47]Now we just watch the mayhem that we've created.
[77:29.53]What is she doing?
[77:37.41]What's going on?
[77:43.87]Wait, look for your toy!
[77:48.55]It's over there somewhere!
[77:52.75]Come on.
[77:53.75]She's gonna put a price tag on it.
[78:01.81]Tag it up.
[78:02.29]Let's go.
[78:02.67]Um.
[78:10.67]I'm not even close.
[78:11.46]So then you have to price tag it?
[78:19.86]Why is she going back in the garage?
[78:21.68]Oh.
[78:28.47]Alright kid, come here.
[78:40.28]That way.
[78:46.04]Into this door.
[78:48.54]There it is.
[78:49.46]Alright.
[78:51.12]Right in front of you.
[78:51.80]Turn around.
[78:59.13]Your toy.
[78:59.61]What about your toy?
[79:00.45]She just takes a swing.
[79:10.20]Can he not see because of his glasses?
[79:11.96]No.
[79:16.62]Wait, hold on.
[79:17.36]Wait, should I give him his other glasses back?
[79:19.91]Alright, I'm gonna give him his glasses back.
[79:34.59]He doesn't give a shit.
[79:36.03]Both shoes untied?
[79:37.39]That's dangerous.
[79:54.57]Here.
[79:54.79]Alright, now you can see again.
[79:59.69]Go look for your toy.
[80:10.68]Toy.
[80:11.36]There it is.
[80:12.26]Everyone thought I was fucking stupid.
[80:14.24]Everybody said he was dumb.
[80:15.80]He doesn't know what he's doing.
[80:16.86]He's switching the glasses again.
[80:18.39]Somebody call his mother.
[80:30.79]Is he actually going to buy this?
[80:32.05]He doesn't remember that it's his?
[80:34.71]He's looking left and right.
[80:35.44]Is he going to steal it?
[80:42.25]Yeah, maybe this thing, can I buy this?
[80:53.18]This is sad.
[80:53.90]I did this, I did this, I'm the master of this.
[81:12.29]End of the Twilight Zone episode, the Geist episode.
[81:14.44]Alright, now what?
[81:16.14]I did it all!
[81:18.20]Let's go!
[81:20.01]What's next?
[81:53.45]See you later.
[81:57.07]What?
[82:04.09]Alright.
[82:06.69]It counts.
[82:09.57]Straight or right?
[82:11.35]Hmm.
[82:13.15]Hmm.
[82:15.49]That's a good question.
[82:16.30]Let's go right.
[82:23.92]Look, you can see... Is he seeing me through the gate?
[82:27.08]Well, I found the entrance.
[82:27.96]Hold on.
[82:28.30]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[82:29.16]It's through here.
[82:40.35]I'm too big.
[82:41.31]I'm too big to fit in there.
[82:44.38]Now what?
[82:46.96]Make someone break the fancy vase.
[82:49.72]Help the woman dress up the... bust?
[82:55.66]Okay.
[82:55.96]I went for the tea one first.
[83:42.79]That's not spitting out tea?
[83:52.10]Do I have to fill it with something else?
[83:53.20]Maybe I have to fill it with, like, bath water or something.
[83:55.31]Or, like, dirty water.
[83:56.93]Dish water.
[83:58.87]Not fucking bath water.
[84:10.65]Oops, that was loud.
[84:12.11]Okay, help the woman dress up the bust.
[84:23.90]No.
[84:24.84]Um... Make someone break the fancy vase.
[84:28.44]Alright.
[84:28.68]Um... Where's the bust?
[84:43.97]Which one of these is the bust?
[84:45.31]There it is, alright.
[84:47.02]Dress up the bust.
[84:55.18]How do I dress it up?
[84:55.84]What do I need to get?
[85:00.53]Some kind of clothes?
[85:05.27]That hurt my ears that I'm the one playing the game.
[85:07.44]Alright, that's how you make us put the T out.
[85:08.94]Good to know.
[85:18.41]Alright, wait for the tea.
[85:23.23]Once he goes up to sip, I'll ring it.
[85:29.79]Dress up the bust.
[85:31.85]That's something I don't understand.
[85:33.25]Uh-oh.
[85:40.22]Can I ruin the painting?
[85:50.04]I can't paint the paint.
[85:51.68]I can't use the paint brush.
[85:53.54]Shit.
[85:56.75]I'm trying to... Uh-oh.
[86:00.35]Wait, there's some clothes.
[86:01.45]You can have this back.
[86:02.31]I don't want it.
[86:18.68]It's stuck.
[86:19.72]It's not a duck!
[86:22.10]Ah!
[86:25.68]Put socks on the d- on the bust?
[86:37.41]Make the man go barefoot!
[86:39.99]Okay, I have to wash- I have to wash these!
[86:47.02]We're in the water over here?
[86:49.83]I'm stuck over here now.
[86:57.22]Wait.
[87:02.87]I haven't eaten all game.
[87:03.75]Is she listening to me?
[87:21.47]She made a squirrel.
[87:23.23]How is that not a... That's not a secret?
[87:28.81]That seems kind of... Ooh.
[87:32.34]Ooh.
[87:34.78]What about this one over here?
[87:35.46]Alright, wait for me to get the tea.
[87:38.36]I'm not causing any problems.
[87:39.34]I'm just waiting for this guy to drink his tea so I can have him chopped down hard.
[87:51.31]There's a picture over here.
[87:52.21]What's in here?
[87:56.07]Oh.
[88:01.93]Do you have to re... Wait, you gotta... Lady, I'm sorry, but you need to put screws in.
[88:08.25]You don't just hold it up.
[88:14.12]I know it looks like you can cut corners on these IKEA builds, but you can't.
[88:17.68]You gotta put all 425 screws in.
[88:30.25]What's this?
[88:34.92]How do I get somebody to break the vape?
[88:36.44]Wait, get the teacup.
[88:38.64]Right?
[88:39.22]Yep.
[88:40.20]Fill it with fucking dirty water.
[88:48.10]Shit!
[88:48.48]He found me.
[88:51.95]No, give me that back.
[88:52.59]I need that.
[88:57.65]Just, I have to poison you.
[88:58.99]Please, leave me alone.
[89:03.33]Alright, get in.
[89:03.77]I gotta get in through there.
[89:04.65]Let's go this way.
[89:08.03]Does this gate open?
[89:10.33]It doesn't.
[89:10.75]What's over here?
[89:11.39]Wait.
[89:16.51]No.
[89:20.57]This route.
[89:21.11]Here we go.
[89:21.49]This is what I'm talking about.
[89:22.46]Fill it up with, like, the dirty well.
[89:27.04]How do I put the... How do I get the well to come up?
[89:46.24]I didn't unlock this?
[90:14.83]So I'm just going to fill it in the fountain.
[90:19.61]That makes sense.
[90:27.68]Thank God the well is idiot-proof.
[90:36.39]Aha, I used the blocking of the newspaper.
[90:37.99]Here we go.
[90:38.33]Okay, I...
[90:51.18]There you go.
[90:51.62]There you go.
[90:52.24]Take it back.
[90:54.22]Now drink out of that.
[91:05.59]Somebody has to break the vase.
[91:10.70]Dress the bust.
[91:11.58]Wash the clothes.
[91:22.96]Here we go.
[91:30.40]I'm just gonna take it off the second you put it... I'm gonna take that off immediately.
[91:33.32]Like, that's just gonna happen, so... No.
[91:36.94]Fuck you.
[91:37.48]I'm gonna take it off again.
[91:39.16]Let me in.
[91:43.17]Give me the sock.
[91:53.77]You know what's over there, now open it for me.
[92:04.47]Well, I guess I could go wrap around.
[92:05.87]Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.
[92:11.57]I'm gonna grab it and run all the way around.
[92:13.45]Alright, get up there!
[92:21.44]Quick, go, go, go!
[92:30.77]He was going to go around in a circle.
[92:31.97]He's like, that's... Wait, wait, wait.
[92:33.61]You're going to return it?
[92:34.55]You're going to return the sock?
[92:37.59]You fucking dick.
[92:39.11]Are you serious?
[92:42.96]I didn't know they did that.
[92:46.18]That dirty tea.
[93:05.95]Uh, I know, the bell.
[93:07.00]Let me do this first.
[93:29.15]Jesus!
[93:31.27]Alright, sock one being cleaned.
[93:45.62]No!
[93:46.96]Just... What?
[93:51.00]Oh, I'm good.
[93:52.02]I'm good.
[94:04.05]Hide.
[94:04.89]Okay, wait till he's done looking.
[94:11.11]Ball socks and the bra are now clean.
[94:13.21]Good.
[94:14.31]Now I need to do a slipper and a bar of soap.
[94:18.91]Oh.
[94:21.19]I know where I have to get that.
[94:25.56]Off of him.
[94:27.82]And then make the man go barefoot.
[94:29.92]So I have to steal his slippers off of his feet.
[94:32.36]And then he has to have no shoes on.
[94:36.47]So I have to wait.
[94:36.99]He's going to pull up the thing.
[94:39.01]Wait till... I got to get an opportunity here.
[94:40.35]He's going to look.
[94:41.61]And I'm going to go right for it.
[94:43.63]He goes... Ready?
[94:44.95]Here we go.
[94:45.37]Three.
[94:46.37]Two.
[94:47.39]One.
[94:52.57]Didn't even know.
[94:54.63]Haha!
[94:55.03]I didn't even know.
[94:56.67]Get the other one.
[95:00.09]Does he not know?
[95:04.25]Wait.
[95:04.43]He's not...
[95:06.60]How do I get the other one?
[95:16.52]Hmm.
[95:20.80]I think he has to cross.
[95:26.33]Will he cross his leg the other way?
[95:39.42]Go on, do it.
[95:41.08]Come on, man.
[95:48.40]Alright.
[95:50.51]He scratches his legs.
[95:53.11]Oh.
[95:53.95]Alright, is he looking?
[95:55.97]He looks to his right.
[95:57.27]I think maybe I can cross around here.
[96:00.69]Hmm.
[96:02.27]How do I do this?
[96:08.94]Got it.
[96:22.72]Alright, now we ding him when he sips.
[96:25.06]And then we're good to go.
[96:32.92]What the f- What?
[96:37.24]Did he just throw that at me?
[96:38.62]He just threw the vase at me!
[96:47.28]Why are you getting the- What are you doing?
[96:51.61]Why is he throwing everything over here?
[97:03.63]I did it again!
[97:04.59]I hope they get a fight.
[97:12.93]They are gonna get a fight.
[97:16.33]Wow.
[97:28.47]That's so fucking loud.
[97:33.63]Can I not do that one anymore?
[97:34.67]Alright.
[97:37.28]Dress up the bust.
[97:39.58]Get dressed up with a ribbon.
[97:44.10]That's a ribbon.
[97:55.01]I love how that's a stun.
[97:56.63]Watch this.
[98:03.91]Oh shit, they're immune to it now.
[98:06.41]Okay.
[98:10.49]How do I put this on?
[98:13.43]Get dressed up with a bow?
[98:23.76]Oh shit!
[98:44.54]Quick, stun him!
[98:50.60]Okay, so... How do I get dressed up?
[98:57.79]Get dressed up with a ribbon.
[99:38.48]Alright, so if I'm... Got soap.
[99:52.19]He got both his wet shoes back.
[99:56.59]Hooray!
[99:57.07]I did it!
[99:57.43]It's in there!
[100:01.06]Wait a minute.
[100:02.50]Oh, fuck.
[100:03.30]It doesn't just complete it.
[100:04.40]Does that count?
[100:12.98]Oh, no.
[100:13.42]I have to get them all in there at the same time.
[100:18.07]Well, that's good to know.
[100:18.69]Alright.
[100:19.75]I still need to figure this out.
[100:25.83]Vase is broken.
[100:26.61]Dress up.
[100:31.38]Well, let me stop.
[100:32.20]The tea thing is... I'll just do the tea right now.
[100:41.85]Is she going to get... She wants the soap back from him.
[100:50.38]Is there any significance in the ladder?
[101:02.71]What do I do with this?
[101:15.51]Get dressed up with a ribbon.
[101:16.53]Help the woman dress the bust.
[101:23.61]I don't know.
[101:24.15]I have no idea.
[101:25.17]Fuck.
[101:46.95]What else is over here?
[101:49.02]What about the frog?
[101:49.70]Should I bring the frog over here?
[101:51.04]I know what to do.
[102:13.23]I'm sorry.
[102:13.49]I was talking to somebody else.
[102:34.64]No, wait, no, stop, stop, stop, stop it, stop it.
[102:38.48]Just... How are you gonna know which one is the real one?
[102:43.33]I'm gonna fucking mess it all up so she doesn't know.
[102:48.37]The perfect distraction.
[103:30.64]Excuse me!
[103:31.22]I think I'm in need of a boat!
[103:53.99]He's so confused.
[104:01.65]No, wait.
[104:03.73]Don't.
[104:04.01]Wait.
[104:32.92]I gotta play a song here, right?
[104:40.60]No, I gotta get in closer.
[104:41.58]No, it's... I can't do it.
[104:56.26]I can't do Super fuckin' Mario.
[104:57.66]I tried.
[105:24.20]Just give, put it down.
[105:25.84]Okay, now she's gonna, alright, this is gonna be perfect.
[105:44.57]I think her brain is gonna be too AI stupid to understand.
[105:47.79]Now she's gonna go get the ribbon.
[105:53.40]Okay, this is the opportunity here.
[106:16.24]What?
[106:16.66]Did you fall down the stairs?
[106:45.11]Where are you going now?
[106:48.68]I'm fucking over with it.
[106:50.42]Holy shit, that was angry.
[106:52.50]Okay, this is where I pull this up here.
[106:54.52]I'm getting rid of this guy.
[106:59.55]You aren't going to be able to find it.
[107:38.83]I fucking tricked you.
[107:45.75]You are so gullible, it's unbelievable!
[107:53.65]That's right, I'm the fucking author here of chaos in these times!
[107:59.45]I get way too into this, I really do.
[108:03.43]Don't ever give me a fucking button to be able to talk.
[108:08.83]Okay, now I gotta wash.
[108:10.59]Wait, I still don't get this one.
[108:15.45]Dress up the bust, but with the clothes... The only clothes that exist are the ones that don't have a rack, right?
[108:25.04]There's a hat on the frog.
[108:28.21]There's a hat on the frog holding the pole.
[108:31.21]Frog is sitting on the log.
[108:33.23]On the stone.
[108:34.95]There's a... There's a windmill.
[108:36.93]There's a...
[108:38.03]There's a hair on the flea, on the board, on the frog, on the bog.
[108:41.45]I tried.
[108:45.03]But I couldn't get it.
[108:47.18]I gotta try.
[108:49.48]I forgot.
[108:50.14]I actually forgot it.
[108:52.30]I probably just disappointed a lot of people.
[108:53.88]Give me the hat.
[108:58.72]No?
[109:03.85]What about your hat?
[109:14.78]I thought I could do the paintbrush, but no.
[109:20.99]And then I have to get everything... The slipper, the soap, and all the clothes over here I have to go into.
[109:27.17]I just don't know.
[109:42.71]Maybe something with the water?
[109:44.56]Fill up the water dish?
[109:50.25]Help?
[109:50.77]I have to help her.
[110:34.78]See the glasses and figure it out.
[110:57.27]Again you have been foiled by the goose!
[111:00.39]It is two times now!
[111:02.37]Can he make it a third?
[111:13.99]What a twofer joke.
[111:18.63]Make sure you... No.
[111:21.97]Look what I found.
[111:22.65]Get these.
[111:23.01]Oh.
[111:28.98]She figured it out.
[111:40.84]Alright, now I gotta get the hat and the pipe.
[111:42.30]I think that should do it.
[111:45.78]And then I really... I gotta have a nice route.
[111:50.14]You know what?
[111:50.46]Let me see if I can get there.
[111:53.50]I just got a fucking big host.
[112:04.35]Halifax just hosted me for like fucking almost a thousand people.
[112:09.67]Welcome.
[112:12.26]Thank you, Halifax.
[112:14.19]And all the viewers that just came over.
[112:16.79]Nice to meet you.
[112:17.17]My name's Jeremy.
[112:21.03]Currently playing the Duck, um, Goose video game.
[112:25.53]If you don't know what it is, I'll give you a really brief description of the whole game.
[112:29.60]I have controlled everything so far!
[112:35.08]That's pretty much all I've done.
[112:38.32]That's the whole thing.
[112:38.94]That's everything I've done.
[112:42.59]That's the extent of every joke.
[112:43.77]That's the extent of every reference I've made so far in this stream.
[112:51.68]And they're all gone.
[112:59.90]I don't know why I have to... I just... John Lithgow!
[113:04.14]I don't know why I have to turn into John Lithgow.
[113:06.29]I don't know what hap... Why?
[113:09.97]Mary!
[113:10.49]He's an alien, Mary!
[113:13.18]I do believe that... You guys don't know who that is?
[113:24.93]How old am I?
[113:29.19]I've walked in a circle twice.
[113:30.69]Alright, hey, Wei, what's up?
[113:32.49]Welcome to the stream.
[113:33.31]Alright, let's go.
[113:34.61]But no, sir, thanks for the host.
[113:35.83]It's the third rock from the sun!
[113:39.45]That's John Lithgow!
[113:40.41]Come on!
[113:41.82]Don't make me walk in a circle again, trying to explain to everybody what's going on.
[113:45.29]Alright.
[113:51.03]And Lord Farquaad.
[113:51.85]That's a better one.
[113:52.37]That's right.
[113:55.00]What was I doing?
[113:55.98]Oh yeah.
[113:56.34]I gotta get his hat.
[114:09.95]No, it's mine.
[114:10.39]You can't have it.
[114:10.79]It's mine.
[114:12.05]God damn it.
[114:13.27]Don't make me do the fucking voice again.
[114:15.65]Don't make me do this again.
[114:17.00]I don't want to do the John Lithgow again.
[114:24.24]But you know I'm gonna.
[115:04.42]No!
[115:12.69]Oh, she can see it
[115:34.39]She'll forget.
[116:07.67]No, no, no.
[116:08.15]This is mine.
[116:09.81]You can't have it.
[116:10.37]I'm not gonna do that four times.
[116:55.22]Uh... Try... I don't know.
[116:58.91]I gotta get the pipe.
[117:01.95]Newspaper is the best thing because that... This is my... I get it right here already.
[117:04.95]It's gonna pull it up.
[117:07.79]And turn... There it is.
[117:10.77]Okay... Let's go now.
[117:19.66]What?
[117:20.00]How the fuck did you see this?
[117:21.92]That makes no sense.
[117:33.92]Didn't get it in the bowl!
[117:36.18]Oops!
[117:40.00]Thank you.
[117:46.62]Thank you.
[117:47.72]Pretty good.
[117:48.43]Not bad.
[117:49.61]I got something else to do?
[117:50.93]Make someone prune the prize rose.
[117:55.11]What?
[118:00.13]Isn't he just doing it right now?
[118:10.98]What are you doing?
[118:17.56]Oh, now they don't want ducks in here anymore.
[118:26.63]Prune the
[118:33.15]Prune the rose.
[118:36.49]I know what to do.
[118:38.45]Watch this shit.
[118:42.17]Yeah.
[118:46.62]Be careful though.
[118:52.70]Careful.
[118:54.72]Don't cut too high.
[119:09.95]here we go now it's really all about getting the okay I have to get this shoes
[119:42.31]Oh, he's looking for it.
[119:47.15]Should I joker left in front of this guy?
[119:56.72]So, let's go ahead and do... Where is she?
[119:59.26]Let's just... I can do this quick.
[120:04.38]Right.
[120:04.62]They're going to argue about everything here.
[120:06.96]Quick.
[120:07.60]You cut my rose down.
[120:08.50]No, I didn't.
[120:10.02]Yes, I did.
[120:10.95]What are you doing?
[120:11.43]Are you going to throw that at him?
[120:12.47]I thought you were just going to bash him in the head with it.
[120:28.02]Where is he?
[120:39.86]And by the way, your bra is in my fountain.
[120:49.99]Really, man?
[120:54.03]Not gonna lie, I've done that a lot of times.
[120:57.03]How many times have you, like, thrown something away in the trash and you just don't give a shit and you miss, like, four times?
[121:02.55]Throw your phone on your bed, you miss the bed twice.
[121:04.65]That happens a lot.
[121:06.15]I can't talk shit.
[121:21.76]Why would I throw my phone?
[121:24.73]It's protected.
[121:28.37]I have to do this without this guy knowing.
[121:29.85]So I have to not alert this guy ever.
[121:32.45]Because he'll keep throwing them over.
[121:34.55]So we have to wait.
[121:35.34]I gotta do this slow.
[121:38.58]Very, very slow.
[121:50.85]Why am I stuck?
[122:00.80]I love when you run the music, please.
[122:02.20]It does that cute music.
[122:06.24]Alright, I gotta get in and out here.
[122:13.07]She'll notice.
[122:13.65]It doesn't matter.
[122:14.49]She can put it back up if she wants.
[122:16.31]He didn't see me, did he?
[122:17.53]No, good.
[122:25.67]Alright, this is where she ties it back up.
[122:28.03]She'll go up to the top.
[122:29.01]I can grab the sock and get around.
[122:32.58]And then it's a bar.
[122:33.26]Actually, I can get bar soap right now.
[122:36.05]Come on, be smart about this.
[123:01.77]Shit, now I have to wait.
[123:02.65]I gotta sit here for a long time now.
[123:08.95]Come on.
[123:17.56]She doesn't know where the soap is, this is bad.
[123:33.72]Soap.
[123:35.94]In.
[123:37.02]Now I just need the other sock and the slipper.
[123:44.57]Shit.
[123:45.03]No, you go ahead and put it back up.
[123:46.69]Okay, now go do some... No, don't paint.
[124:00.62]Whatever.
[124:00.92]I'm just going in.
[124:07.40]Okay, we gotta act I would laugh right now, but I don't want to lose Smooth got it
[124:39.34]Done.
[124:47.20]I can't leave this way.
[124:48.00]Where do I have to leave?
[124:56.13]I got the way I came.
[125:01.09]In somebody's house?
[125:03.59]I mean, I want the ball.
[125:04.57]It goes with my outfit.
[125:05.85]I'm taking it.
[125:08.19]You know what I'm saying?
[125:16.89]So now, back up.
[125:20.20]This is the only place I haven't gone.
[125:39.05]To the well?
[125:50.46]I can't.
[126:03.67]I tried.
[126:03.97]Alright.
[126:08.82]Wait!
[126:26.78]How do I get it in there?
[126:33.93]I didn't get anything for doing that?
[126:47.58]Okay.
[126:51.95]No way to escape this gate.
[126:58.70]So, I'm gonna bring it down.
[126:59.64]Oh, look at that.
[127:04.75]Look at that one!
[127:05.41]Go ahead and open.
[127:08.37]No, where does... Oh, I see.
[127:14.09]We're back out here.
[127:14.96]This is the beginning of the game.
[127:15.96]There's a shortcut.
[127:27.97]I need some more to-do lists.
[127:33.31]You know, that's not a bad idea.
[128:09.90]Okay.
[128:15.32]Come on.
[128:15.82]Get me in there.
[128:16.88]I know it's possible.
[128:17.84]I'm going to find the right spot with the rock.
[128:21.20]Wedge it in the rock.
[128:29.99]See you later.
[128:40.52]Shit's gone.
[128:42.89]I can't go in it, though.
[128:46.01]I can't get in there.
[128:58.56]Alright, let me try going back up here.
[129:13.51]The gate?
[129:14.03]You can open the gate.
[129:15.91]Wait a minute.
[129:17.48]Hold on.
[129:19.02]Wait a second.
[129:19.54]I need to look over here.
[129:20.32]Oh.
[129:24.06]Look at that.
[129:28.12]I can go this way.
[129:29.02]This is the very beginning.
[129:39.22]Who knows this is new?
[129:41.72]What's going on over here?
[129:42.66]No, this is super locked.
[129:58.68]Wait.
[130:05.88]What?
[130:09.95]It goes down here?
[130:18.75]Oh, I thought a well was a well.
[130:32.44]Didn't think it was a well, okay.
[130:46.98]Well, the rake still exists.
[130:48.10]Alright, let me go back up here.
[130:51.30]A stove is a stove, yeah.
[130:53.24]A well is a well.
[130:55.92]A bench is a bench.
[130:58.20]I can't go that way.
[130:59.34]So is there... This is the only way I can go.
[131:12.29]Am I missing something here?
[131:31.00]I'm back at this house.
[131:31.98]This is wrong.
[131:40.49]Let's move.
[131:42.97]Streamer, watch out for the goose.
[131:45.53]I am the goose.
[131:49.25]Something's wrong.
[131:53.67]Why did I lose control?
[131:56.86]What?
[131:58.26]Okay.
[131:59.22]Apparently my Xbox controller is messed up.
[132:01.18]That's alright.
[132:06.32]So, is there something... Another thing to do over here?
[132:08.83]In the house or something?
[132:11.01]I don't want to lose my ribbon.
[132:28.34]Is there another way for me to go?
[132:29.60]Oh, shit.
[132:36.26]Can I go... Ah, alright.
[132:38.26]There we go.
[132:40.22]Are you kidding me?
[132:43.06]Did I actually lose it?
[132:47.04]Oh, that sucks.
[132:53.91]I'll play Bad Bitten.
[132:54.95]Alright, can I go in the house?
[133:05.11]Sorry.
[133:05.43]There's a package here.
[133:11.03]I'm going to deliver the... What the fuck is going on?
[133:14.69]Why is this happening?
[133:19.91]Hold on.
[133:26.09]Is this thing dead?
[133:31.25]So, deliver the package to the other person's house.
[133:33.21]Switch their mail.
[133:35.87]You got it.
[133:42.47]Cool.
[133:44.34]This is a crime.
[133:45.92]You can't arrest an animal.
[134:01.64]That looks good.
[134:04.92]No.
[134:06.10]Oh, this is this way.
[134:07.48]I remember this.
[134:11.00]This is a shortcut.
[134:11.88]That's one of the first things I saw.
[134:18.85]This looks dangerous.
[134:19.93]Cars?
[134:33.80]That's you're about to witness a robbery music.
[134:38.07]Something dangerous is gonna happen here.
[134:54.15]Wait, can I...
[135:05.94]Hey, holy shit!
[135:07.52]You knew there was a fucking animal in here!
[135:09.48]What's wrong with you?
[135:10.38]Are you out of your mind?
[135:16.00]You're fucked up.
[135:17.42]You know that?
[135:23.00]Okay, so I have to get delivered somewhere.
[135:24.36]Where though?
[135:24.74]Get out of my way.
[135:27.14]I'm gonna go over here.
[135:32.96]This is a good view.
[135:37.49]Look at that guy's shoes.
[135:40.37]Hold on, I gotta open another shortcut.
[135:46.16]Nice.
[135:46.76]So what's this tackle box for?
[135:50.68]Somebody... I'm gonna leave it here so I'll forget.
[135:52.68]I don't want to forget and mess this whole thing up.
[135:56.62]Alright, the buoy and the tackle box is over here.
[136:03.49]You can't fish, can you?
[136:26.20]Can I take it?
[136:27.82]He has a bald head.
[136:28.68]Should I put something on his head?
[136:31.90]Can I put a cone on his head?
[136:41.61]Let me see what happens when I go in here.
[136:43.24]I'm waiting for that person to come back.
[136:57.32]Alright, you load me in the truck and then you take me where?
[136:59.88]I don't know.
[137:17.47]You don't want to open it?
[137:24.65]That was weird.
[137:25.55]I wonder if there's an animal in the box.
[137:27.99]Get into the pub?
[137:30.53]This place is huge.
[137:43.44]Thank you.
[137:55.79]No, get out of there.
[137:56.79]So what's in here?
[138:21.62]Break the dartboard.
[138:23.82]Get the toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy- fuck.
[138:29.94]Make the old man fall on his bum.
[138:32.38]Be awarded a flower.
[138:34.16]Steal a pint glass and drop it in the canal.
[138:36.78]Set the table.
[138:41.23]Okay.
[138:43.65]Knife, fork, plate, pepper, candle.
[138:46.97]I got the plate.
[138:47.63]I got the dumpster.
[138:54.91]This looks kind of shitty, though.
[138:55.87]I want to make this look better.
[138:57.17]Plate.
[139:07.45]Pepper.
[139:11.03]And boxes?
[139:13.99]What is this?
[139:15.81]Is this a jetpack?
[139:20.39]No, I'm sorry.
[139:21.11]That's my mistake.
[139:21.77]It's one of those Mario boots.
[139:22.89]I don't know what I'm supposed to do with this.
[139:30.19]I'd laugh my ass off if another goose jumps out of there and starts fucking talking.
[139:39.08]You're still here.
[139:39.90]Hold on.
[139:42.40]Oh, there's Pepper right here.
[139:43.72]Alright, Pepper.
[139:44.74]How do I get up there?
[139:48.21]Oh, shit.
[139:51.41]I would laugh my ass off.
[139:57.54]This is gonna be hell.
[139:58.40]Alright, I have to sneak up there and grab the pepper.
[140:22.20]Don't turn around and do something!
[140:23.22]Alright, I'm breaking the dartboard.
[140:35.12]One note.
[140:36.58]Hey, he's gonna throw to me!
[140:41.68]Let me try.
[140:42.14]Here, you try it again.
[140:59.07]Do I want to try to get him to win?
[141:07.37]Glad you had a goose that just fetched you these things.
[141:16.34]By the way, if anybody has a dog in the room and they have speakers on, I would turn it down a little, because I'm about to do, uh... Where's the owner?
[141:46.11]No!
[141:49.75]No!
[141:50.51]He's not gonna stop.
[141:51.15]I have to run away and hide.
[142:00.14]No, he's actually zoning me out.
[142:03.18]You gotta be kidding me.
[142:04.62]He just zoned me the fuck out.
[142:18.96]Hope your keys weren't in there!
[142:38.59]I'm trying to get them to not pay attention.
[142:53.26]Bingo!
[142:53.62]Is he sniffing it?
[143:19.78]With the butt!
[143:20.20]There it is.
[143:21.50]Nice work.
[143:31.99]Okay, I'm in.
[143:34.17]Let's... Wait.
[143:35.15]Yeah, over here.
[143:36.49]What is wrong with me?
[143:37.27]I don't know.
[143:40.24]I like honking.
[143:46.40]I need to get in here without them seeing.
[143:49.86]How the hell am I going to do that?
[143:51.64]They turn around, right?
[143:52.42]Can I go over here?
[143:55.81]Let me try to get in here.
[143:59.95]Okay.
[144:00.91]Okay.
[144:02.52]I'm going this way.
[144:03.44]Oh, all the way around.
[144:08.11]Do I need a tomato?
[144:10.33]Pepper.
[144:11.69]Make the old man fall on his bum.
[144:14.39]Get the toy boat.
[144:15.39]Break the dartboard.
[144:16.27]No.
[144:16.35]Nothing to do with a tomato.
[144:18.71]I feel like I'm going to need it, though.
[144:30.89]Why do I feel like I'm gonna need this?
[144:32.16]I don't know.
[144:45.69]Oh, shit.
[145:04.84]Are you gonna come get the tomato?
[145:07.49]Maybe she'll come down and pick up the tomato.
[145:41.00]What do I need?
[145:41.60]I need a knife, fork, pepper, candle.
[145:43.80]Okay, alright.
[145:56.15]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[145:57.61]Throw it.
[145:57.85]Can I throw it up there?
[145:59.25]I can't, like, dump it up there?
[146:01.90]Damn it.
[146:02.36]I can't throw it over.
[146:03.12]Oh, that sucks.
[146:10.82]I know.
[146:11.18]Get the toy boat.
[146:13.02]I know.
[146:18.46]Can I pull a table over?
[146:22.13]Why did I just do that?
[146:23.37]What was the point of that?
[146:32.79]I think I have to do that to somebody.
[146:38.33]Wait a minute.
[146:52.15]He just had gone with the water.
[146:54.03]That's awesome.
[146:56.47]When I get the toy boat, what do I do with the toy boat?
[147:04.96]Do I just win?
[147:23.72]I'm too small.
[147:24.62]You can't get in here.
[147:25.24]Uh-oh.
[147:30.14]Alright, I have to... I have to wait until she opens the door again.
[147:37.59]No, I did it.
[147:38.07]I don't have to get it more than once.
[147:39.27]Break the dartboard, though, is going to be tricky, I think.
[147:40.82]Wait, does she know where I am?
[147:56.42]Uh-oh.
[148:10.41]Well, I'm in trouble, I think.
[148:11.51]Okay.
[148:17.37]Oh.
[148:17.61]Well, that was easy.
[148:25.97]Haha.
[148:27.73]Candle, knife, and fork.
[148:29.95]I still don't understand this whole bucket thing.
[148:31.88]Oh shit.
[149:30.54]There's a candle.
[149:45.82]Don't zone me.
[149:46.38]Don't zone me.
[149:46.90]Don't zone me.
[149:47.34]Don't zone me out.
[149:47.92]Don't zone me out.
[149:48.54]Give me the candle.
[149:49.17]Don't zone me out.
[149:50.09]They're zoning me out.
[150:06.87]It's desperately trying to zone me.
[150:13.93]Get over here!
[150:14.79]Stop!
[150:27.08]Oh no, is the owner here?
[150:31.10]Yeah, you can't come under the table.
[150:32.16]Fuck off.
[150:46.38]No, fork.
[150:49.12]Alright, now I need knife.
[150:51.44]Candle.
[150:55.32]And that's it.
[150:57.03]The table will have been set by that point.
[151:08.67]Oh, you fucking put it away.
[151:10.12]Give me the knife.
[151:24.71]He's got a knife!
[151:25.73]Yeah, he's got a knife and he's putting it on the table.
[151:30.00]Candle.
[151:33.44]It only took 10 minutes of Boomer Goosen.
[151:38.60]That's true, it did.
[151:44.45]You can zone me all you want, I'm just gonna go around.
[151:55.68]Out of the way!
[151:57.00]Get out of the way.
[151:58.16]Oh my god, you idiot with the box.
[152:02.18]You idiot!
[152:02.90]That's just a wall in front of me.
[152:07.82]I need that candle.
[152:13.56]Get it!
[152:14.34]Get it!
[152:16.48]Just go in, in, in, in, in, in!
[152:21.02]What am I doing?
[152:37.66]The table has been set!
[152:42.46]Alright.
[152:43.22]Steal a pineclas and drop it in the canal.
[152:46.64]Make the old man fall and break the dartboard.
[152:49.20]Alright, make the old man... make the old man fall.
[152:58.56]How the hell do I do that?
[152:59.36]This game is fucking hilarious.
[153:04.17]It's just so stupid.
[153:07.37]I'm taking this very seriously too.
[153:45.89]Just ready.
[153:48.05]That's the face of something that's going to remove the stool from underneath you and is waiting for you to sit down.
[154:06.42]Break the dartboard.
[154:07.44]I probably have to...
[154:13.86]Maybe give him something else that's not a dart but looks like a dart?
[154:47.14]If you have a dog, turn your- nevermind.
[154:49.36]Alright, how do I- maybe I should scare him?
[155:00.29]When he throws a dart... Break the dart board.
[155:33.63]Okay, uh, what?
[155:35.34]Oh, a flower!
[155:35.76]There's a flower!
[155:36.30]A flower right there!
[155:37.98]You think that's funny?
[155:39.48]Cool, give me a flower.
[155:42.72]There's a flower right here.
[156:06.18]Yay!
[156:09.98]Thank you.
[156:11.02]Thank you.
[156:12.04]Very much.
[156:17.80]Got it.
[156:19.40]Steal a pint glass.
[156:22.16]And throw it in the canal.
[156:25.76]Pint... Okay.
[156:26.42]I gotta get it back in the bar.
[156:34.30]Get this one.
[156:34.98]Okay.
[156:35.94]I'm gonna keep this.
[156:36.52]It's mine.
[156:36.86]Actually, I'll give it to the old man.
[156:42.68]You can have that.
[156:43.16]That's for you.
[156:46.10]Here.
[156:48.36]That's for you.
[156:54.96]I wonder, what do I need to do about this?
[157:00.30]Let me do the pint glass first, because that's the last thing I have to do over here.
[157:02.98]What's...
[157:10.34]Throw it into the canal.
[157:11.46]Do I have to take this all the way out of here?
[157:22.92]And throw it into the water all the way down.
[157:51.32]OY!
[158:17.01]Clean the broken glass.
[158:19.87]So shit, how do I get over there?
[158:23.21]I can't screw that up again.
[158:27.81]What?
[158:28.85]Oh, I just, I can drain the beer?
[158:30.99]Wait, just one more.
[158:52.18]The bucket!
[158:53.10]There's only two pint glasses in here!
[159:08.04]Fill the mug with beer?
[159:09.18]That's a task that you're gonna be giving to me.
[159:12.42]That I don't think I'm gonna be able to accomplish.
[159:13.82]Can you move out of the way, please?
[159:20.69]That's the sound a cat makes before it pukes.
[159:39.69]That's the funniest thing I've heard all week.
[159:46.77]Go underneath the table so he can't get you.

[175:31.19]Okay, he's gonna get it.
[175:35.26]He wants to get the tomato.
[175:37.50]Right?
[175:37.76]He's like, where would I find a tomato in this night?
[175:40.00]Over here.
[175:43.90]There he goes.
[175:44.41]He's going to get the tomato in the other room.
[175:46.33]Up the stairs, bucket on head.
[175:47.33]He's going for the flower.
[175:51.19]Go.
[176:00.04]Nailed it.
[176:06.12]Now I just need... Break the dartboard!
[176:08.82]How do I break the dartboard?
[176:19.31]I still don't get this.
[176:23.76]Blow on the horn when he throws?
[176:25.80]That's possible.
[176:42.91]What?
[176:43.61]Oh.
[176:45.61]Uh-oh.
[176:49.93]Big guy's back.
[176:56.84]I didn't see his back.
[177:16.37]You don't!
[177:22.85]Blood on his ass.
[177:31.75]Is he gone yet?
[177:33.25]No, he's putting it in... He's washing it and putting the single tomato in this box.
[177:38.85]In his tomato box, okay.
[177:44.11]What?
[177:44.75]Why did I... Alright, I've had to just spawn up this guy.
[177:59.28]He's gonna hide over here.
[178:02.22]No, I don't want to play with you.
[178:03.20]I don't want to play that game with you.
[178:04.32]Stop.
[178:07.84]Is he actually coming over here to put that flower back in the vase over here?
[178:11.98]I was given that flower.
[178:14.14]That's not yours to take.
[178:16.52]Is he gonna stand up there and start waving his arms?
[178:27.19]Okay.
[178:30.95]Play the harmonica.
[178:32.23]Get up there.
[178:34.98]I can just chill.
[178:45.03]Nice work.
[178:47.02]Now give it to me.
[178:50.84]Yes, your back hurts.
[178:53.86]Yes, it does.
[178:54.90]Hide.
[178:55.14]Can you see me?
[178:58.26]Here we go with the darts.
[178:59.97]Turn around.
[179:04.37]And...
[179:20.47]Too early.
[179:21.45]Yeah.
[179:22.29]Just a little bit.
[179:37.04]Did it all!
[179:37.56]Alright, now what?
[179:39.81]Where do I go from here?
[179:53.06]How do I... I can't leave?
[179:55.87]Wait.
[179:56.63]Wait!
[179:57.09]Hold on.
[180:34.55]Wait!
[180:35.33]Give me that.
[180:41.23]I did it!
[180:43.38]Yeah!
[180:50.54]Why are these houses so tiny?
[180:57.85]Why am I a fucking monster?
[181:06.42]That's pretty terrifying.
[181:07.44]Well, I can't go that way yet.
[181:12.66]So I'll go this way.
[181:15.58]Wait.
[181:15.71]Let me rinse off.
[181:52.26]Get into the model village.
[181:54.94]Steal the beautiful miniature golden belt.
[182:02.75]Why would I do that?
[182:03.45]Doesn't sound very nice.
[182:26.07]Oh, wait, this is the whole world.
[182:29.44]Oh.
[182:33.60]And that's me.
[182:36.16]That's on the left.
[182:37.04]That's me looking into the model, playing the game with the goose in the middle there.
[182:47.29]Whoa.
[182:49.39]Whoa, that's cool.
[182:58.85]Alright, what else is over here?
[182:59.93]I don't remember this lady.
[183:08.33]Rip it out.
[183:10.65]Just... Oh, that's satisfying.
[183:12.95]It is.
[183:16.55]Come on.
[183:19.40]Come on, I want... Yes!
[183:23.44]Feels good.
[183:31.94]Remember this?
[183:32.42]This is the... That was like opening a wine bottle.
[183:50.51]Yeah.
[183:55.62]Can I get the well?
[184:00.95]This is the pub.
[184:04.23]So if I go over there, what happens?
[184:20.19]It's Avatar being faced with reality.
[184:22.11]This is not good.
[184:22.77]This is how Back to the Future 4 is going to end.
[184:35.60]Ah!
[184:36.96]Hold on.
[184:37.40]I can't... If I move, it hurts.
[184:39.26]I'm fucking bumping into shit.
[184:45.19]Put me down.
[184:45.51]Put me down.
[184:51.21]I'm not doing that again.
[184:59.41]Ow.
[185:00.31]Wait.
[185:00.89]If I lean down, can you... This is gonna be fucking weird.
[185:07.84]Can you hear that?
[185:08.80]Do I have to eat the building?
[185:27.31]I don't want to eat- what is it, a sand castle?
[185:40.88]There are probably some new viewers here.
[185:44.60]I am about one or two clicks shy of beating the world record for clicking with one hand as fast as possible.
[185:53.15]I almost beat it on stream.
[185:54.89]Just in case anyone was curious.
[186:07.13]Pull it.
[186:14.44]Why am I destroying this?
[186:15.44]This doesn't seem right.
[186:16.18]I have to get the bell.
[186:26.71]Do I need to break it down some more?
[186:28.65]What about this side?
[186:31.15]No, I'm just too weak.
[186:31.97]Come on, I can do it.
[186:32.73]Let's go.
[186:33.07]Ooh, that was loud.
[187:08.27]Get the fuck out of here, man.
[187:13.21]Steal the bell!
[187:14.65]And then take it all the way back home.
[187:22.19]Let's go!
[187:22.47]Give me the bell, give me the bell.
[187:24.82]Wait, I'm gonna alert everybody.
[187:37.13]I don't, like, awaken everybody and they turn... Get out of the way.
[187:47.20]This ain't gonna be some, like, meta, like, BioShock thing, is it?
[187:54.44]Wait.
[187:55.38]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[188:08.10]Oh, right.
[188:21.41]Why is this so scary?
[188:22.31]The music is scary music.
[188:26.91]I can't open this?
[188:29.22]Why is this locked?
[188:55.48]What?
[188:55.78]Where am I?
[188:56.24]Oh.
[188:59.06]Let me out?
[188:59.68]No, don't let me out.
[189:07.14]No, I have to bring the bell all the way back and it alerts everybody.
[189:09.70]Of course it does.
[189:12.40]Give me that!
[189:24.26]I distracted him with Megalovania.
[189:25.50]It works every time.
[189:37.23]No, where are they going to bring it?
[189:38.51]Where are you going to bring that bell?
[189:40.75]To untie his shoes.
[189:43.61]No, I need that.
[189:47.87]Get the... Get out of my way.
[189:50.79]God damn it.
[189:54.81]Trip.
[189:55.15]Just trip and fall and break your face.
[189:56.97]Come on.
[189:59.54]Who has the bell?
[190:00.64]Good.
[190:01.50]He's got blood all over him.
[190:16.11]Okay, I'm not doing that again.
[190:17.29]Let's go!
[190:34.83]I'm stuck on the- Give me the fucking bell!
[190:47.99]Give me the bell!
[190:49.43]Give me the bell!
[190:50.53]Give me that bell!
[190:55.91]She just- Holy shit, she gave it to me.
[191:09.74]complete haha you don't have oh what's the problem over here looks like you don't have jurisdiction I may as well have crossed over to Mexico you idiot ding dong ding dong
[191:43.08]I don't know which way to go.
[191:53.97]You gonna lock me out of this one?
[191:55.13]They're all locked.
[192:11.89]I have to re-break this?
[192:52.45]Why would I do that?
[192:53.37]I just, I ranked the big one.
[192:54.65]What am I thinking?
[192:55.33]What are you going to do?
[193:05.04]What are you going to bring it?
[193:07.72]Huh?
[193:07.84]What are you going to do with it?
[193:12.82]I'll play along for a little bit.
[193:13.90]What are you doing?
[193:15.78]Are you?
[193:15.94]Okay, fine.
[193:24.63]Oh my god, I'm so stupid.
[193:26.99]She cares more about the sign.
[193:32.27]Give me that sign!
[193:34.52]Oh, not my sign!
[193:48.06]Uh-oh.
[193:53.37]He still has her bra.
[193:58.21]He can't... He still has the bra.
[194:01.95]He's been trying to get that over there for a long time.
[194:10.20]Oh, what's the matter?
[194:11.36]It doesn't look like...
[194:14.14]Gotta get the bell back, gotta get the bell back, gotta get the bell back!
[195:06.59]Uh-oh, later the broom.
[195:19.11]He thought he was brave for a second, but he's still scared of geese, so he ain't gonna do anything.
[195:35.89]The final boss he was waiting at the door Let's go Think I did it Yeah, I think that's it I made it I
[196:07.94]What?
[196:08.64]Where's my home?
[196:12.32]Ah...
[196:31.37]Let's see.
[196:32.05]I have... I remember... So I spoiled the whole game when I looked at the... Everybody was like, why did you look back there?
[196:42.55]You weren't supposed to do that.
[196:49.20]Wait a minute.
[196:53.26]Is that why I have the bike over here?
[196:54.62]Because I love that sound?
[197:03.88]Oh wow Okay, let's see what the climax is
[197:41.16]Good night.
[197:41.60]So you're just taking bells.
[197:52.78]I can't honk during the cutscene.
[198:01.89]Well, there's going to be an after credits scene.
[198:10.07]She finally got it.
[198:20.29]This game was good.
[198:23.71]It was.
[198:26.84]They took a concept of just be a goat.
[198:30.36]And they made it... That was just adorable.
[198:33.60]I would classify that as a cute game.
[198:37.49]What was it?
[198:38.03]Like three hours?
[198:38.57]Something like that?
[198:40.91]It's a little short, but... I mean, it's still... What is it?
[198:44.47]14, 15 bucks?
[198:51.57]Goose.
[198:52.51]Right.
[198:53.23]I don't know.
[198:54.41]It's been a long week.
[199:01.88]Oops.
[199:04.42]What happened?
[199:14.07]Some people are linking.
[199:15.47]I clicked it.
[199:15.99]I clicked it.
[199:16.41]I clicked it.
[199:17.17]Look.
[199:21.19]This is from Joel.
[199:22.07]Joel said, also, my message earlier got lost in the fray of comments.
[199:25.84]But I wanted to shout out how talented and creative you are.
[199:29.44]You're making the rest of us look bad.
[199:34.82]I don't know about that.
[199:39.05]That means a lot, though.
[199:39.85]Thanks a lot, Joel.
[199:40.55]Seriously.
[199:46.45]That means a lot coming from a fellow fucking comedian.
[199:48.81]You know what I mean?
[199:50.27]Somebody as funny and talented as you saying that.
[199:52.07]It means a lot.
[199:52.59]It does.
[200:00.08]What?
[200:08.88]Hold on.
[200:09.16]Wait, wait.
[200:09.44]There's new... Cabbage Picnic.
[200:16.60]You just unlock more things to do.
[200:22.22]Get thrown over the fence.
[200:26.12]Score a goal.
[200:29.71]Reset to give this a go.
[200:31.13]Complete the garden to-do list before the church bell rings.
[200:33.89]That's what the bell was.
[200:34.79]Remember earlier?
[200:35.35]I was wondering.
[200:39.49]Cross out everything on the to-do list.
[200:44.43]So every area now has like an extra little thing to do.
[200:48.51]Lock the groundskeeper out of the garden?
[200:53.47]So it's just another day.
[200:57.25]The last one is impossible.
[201:00.34]Collect the five flowers.
[201:02.60]In the basket over by the well, a tulip, a lily, a rose, a daisy, a chrysanthemum.
[201:09.64]Sail the toy boat under a bridge.
[201:11.84]Oh, I have to do that.
[201:12.92]Perform at the pub wearing a ribbon.
[201:15.03]Steal the old man's wooden hat.
[201:19.25]Rake and lake really fast.
[201:24.27]There is no rake and lake.
[201:34.60]Oh, it actually is New Game Plus.
[201:37.68]Everything is the same.
[201:42.38]I thought it was a reset.
[201:43.84]No, it's not.
[201:44.32]Alright.
[201:46.34]Open an umbrella inside the TV shop.
[201:48.05]Make someone from outside the high street buy back their own stuff.
[201:52.29]What?
[201:55.83]Cabbage picnic is easy.
[202:02.58]No, it's not.
[202:04.30]Not even close.
[202:04.94]It's going to be very hard, actually.
[202:11.75]Cabbage pick.
[202:12.79]This is gonna be... Oh shit.
[202:14.69]Do I have to get them all?
[202:15.51]There's one or two.
[202:16.39]How many do I need?
[202:33.68]This is hard.
[202:34.32]Did he just take a bite out of it?
[202:48.89]Oh, the physics on this is so difficult.
[202:50.51]Let's see if I can keep it just through the gate.
[202:53.65]I wonder if you need more than one.
[202:58.29]Come on.
[202:58.61]Cabbage picnic.
[202:59.25]I at least have to get one of these.
[203:07.38]Go.
[203:09.60]Don't roll too far.
[203:11.00]Don't roll.
[203:11.48]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[203:12.26]Easy, easy, easy.
[203:21.24]Cabbage picnic?
[203:22.48]Cabbage picnic.
[203:25.78]Beautiful.
[203:27.86]Trip the boy in the puddle?
[203:31.82]Okay, what's the other stuff?
[203:33.78]Catch an object as it's thrown over the fence.
[203:35.75]Alright, I know how to do that one.
[203:40.25]Score a goal.
[203:41.33]So I have to get the soccer ball from the kid all the way over.
[203:44.83]How do I get thrown over the fence?
[203:57.00]Yeah, you can make the kid fall.
[204:02.64]So trip the kid right here.
[204:03.78]So you have to untie... you have to scare him.
[204:15.74]So scare him back this way.
[204:21.63]JermaSucks just gave 20 community subs.
[204:26.31]Thank you, JermaSucks.
[204:28.75]Appreciate it.
[204:34.87]That's a lot.
[204:35.72]Let's see.
[204:36.28]Right in the puddle.
[204:36.80]Boom.
[204:39.36]That not count?
[204:41.54]There it is.
[204:45.88]StreamerSucks.
[204:46.78]No, thank you.
[204:47.58]That's a lot of subs.
[204:53.79]Open an umbrella in the TV shop.
[204:59.00]One of these umbrellas?
[205:06.31]How the hell do I open this in here?
[205:09.61]Can I grab the other side?
[205:11.31]Oh, shit!
[205:12.05]Okay.
[205:12.61]Can I close it?
[205:13.11]Close it up.
[205:15.63]How do I close the umbrella?
[205:19.75]I can't.
[205:20.07]Okay.
[205:20.61]Well, I know how that works, though.
[205:23.79]I got three chances here.
[205:40.38]Does it count?
[205:41.11]Does it count?
[205:41.47]Does it count?
[205:41.79]Does it count?
[205:42.11]Does it count?
[206:09.22]Oh, you closed it for me.
[206:10.16]Thank you.
[206:20.13]Do it for this one too, please.
[206:23.15]Oh my god, Jeremy.
[206:33.13]It's alright.
[206:33.45]I want to do it with this one anyways.
[206:45.69]with the rake in the lake.
[206:48.21]I'm not doing the rake in the lake.
[206:50.23]No!
[206:50.79]No rake in the lake!
[206:52.96]Where's the kid?
[207:03.98]Can I pull you over here, please?
[207:16.49]Get out of my life.
[207:18.17]See you later.
[207:26.48]I can't do rake in late, guys.
[207:27.72]The rake doesn't exist.
[207:28.62]That was a great parry move that she just did.
[207:41.17]Lock the groundskeeper.
[207:41.97]Make someone from outside the... Okay, I gotta score a goal.
[207:47.02]Score a goal.
[207:47.60]I can bring it over here.
[207:58.01]Shit.
[207:58.13]Get out of this door.
[207:58.85]Out of this door!
[208:04.27]No!
[208:04.95]Shit.
[208:06.41]Why did I roll it this way?
[208:07.23]That was a mistake.
[208:08.42]There's a rake right there.
[208:10.66]I can't grab it.
[208:16.24]Alright, I'm done.
[208:18.26]I'm out.
[208:18.66]I'm out.
[208:18.86]You did it.
[208:19.32]Good.
[208:19.81]Congratulations.
[208:20.57]No, stop.
[208:21.29]Get out.
[208:26.81]Get me this thing.
[208:35.60]Just break it for all I care.
[208:38.98]Good.
[208:48.40]No!
[208:48.98]It's almost there.
[208:49.68]Oh, it's so close!
[208:51.37]Just move!
[208:55.53]Get penguin!
[208:59.07]Doesn't the penguin do that for a move?
[209:08.86]Okay.
[209:09.74]Bye.
[209:14.48]Almost there.
[209:16.08]So now the soccer... I think the soccer's up here?
[209:18.46]I think, right?
[209:37.63]Oh, don't kick it back.
[209:45.38]This is so cute.
[209:46.28]I love how not once, I mean, besides this, the arms just never come up.
[209:58.58]Not a bad dribble.
[209:59.30]No, it's not.
[209:59.96]It's pretty good, actually.
[210:00.72]It's not bad.
[210:06.23]Where's the... Which way is it?
[210:14.34]Is it left?
[210:15.06]No.
[210:15.40]Where's the soccer net?
[210:27.01]I don't remember.
[210:27.59]I hope it's this way.
[210:45.79]But those of you that... We talked a lot about the carnival earlier.
[210:48.67]And I wanted to reiterate one more time that... You can expect something like that to happen every few months now.
[211:00.16]That shit is already... We're already starting to work on and talk on the next one.
[211:05.22]Not carnival related.
[211:06.14]I'm just saying just something like that.
[211:08.44]And I brought this all the way over here.
[211:10.52]Oh, this is bad.
[211:21.14]You're gonna get hit in the face with a frog every couple months.
[211:23.56]Maybe.
[211:23.86]Depends on what we do.
[211:27.90]Alright, is he gonna steal the soccer ball?
[211:31.22]If they see this, will they take it?
[211:39.67]Dude, don't take the ball away from me.
[211:41.37]Take out your cell phone, videotape this.
[211:45.27]And make, like, $200,000 by this YouTube video.
[211:49.63]That would have a billion views.
[211:52.66]Film it.
[211:53.12]Sell it to a news agency.
[211:54.78]License the video out.
[211:57.02]Put cat food out now, or bird food out, in front of your door to bring this fucking goose back.
[212:04.53]To get new videos every day.
[212:07.35]Carry the goose.
[212:08.95]You would be worth millions of dollars.
[212:22.71]Why would you be angry at this?
[212:23.63]This is just depositing free money into your checking account.
[212:28.63]All you have to do is film it.
[212:32.03]It's an awesome goose.
[212:33.21]It doesn't understand what money is.
[212:41.38]And then you could just buy the goose a gigantic goose house.
[212:46.12]And put all the things that goose love the most in there.
[212:53.08]That was not a bad shot.
[212:59.07]There it is.
[213:18.02]Don't roll all the way down.
[213:18.96]Where is it?
[213:21.86]This one sucks.
[213:25.60]I'm going the wrong way.
[213:28.16]The net is right over here.
[213:30.66]Is this not the correct net?
[213:33.16]This has to be.
[213:37.04]Oh boy.
[213:47.38]There it is.
[213:48.92]Hooray!
[213:49.44]Alright.
[213:53.06]Catch an object as it's thrown over the fence.
[213:55.74]So here's what I'm going to do.
[213:57.30]I'm going to put the bra in the water.
[214:00.56]Guy's going to throw.
[214:01.30]I'm going to catch it when he throws it over.
[214:19.06]Why was she watching him?
[214:20.05]That was weird.
[214:25.35]Yes, he is.
[214:25.63]He's going to throw it over.
[214:26.47]I'm going to put it right in front of him.
[214:28.91]I'm going to wait for the newspaper.
[214:30.23]Watch this.
[214:31.89]Newspaper goes up.
[214:32.47]He's going to look.
[214:34.21]Newspaper goes... Check it out.
[214:36.03]I'm going to drop it right in front of his T. Here we go.
[214:38.57]One, two, three, go.
[214:41.48]Unavoidable.
[214:42.74]Now I'm going to get back over.
[214:43.78]Wait!
[214:51.86]He's an idiot.
[214:52.50]I forgot...
[215:00.18]That didn't count?
[215:03.87]Why did that not count?
[215:09.28]That should have counted.
[215:42.39]on that test that is technically he reached his arm over and let it go he threw that over the fence
[216:13.29]Get the vase, yeah.
[216:14.93]I think the vase will work.
[216:15.75]Getting scammed by technicalities.
[216:32.72]Alright.
[216:36.19]Where is it?
[216:36.89]Where is he?
[216:37.23]Where does he throw it?
[216:38.69]Right here?
[216:38.97]Where does he throw it?
[216:41.31]Oh no!
[216:47.38]It's over here Shit, will he do it again?
[217:11.97]Alright, he throws it like right here.
[217:13.21]I'll be ready.
[217:13.73]Oh, fuck me.
[217:33.37]No, don't throw it yet.
[217:34.23]Don't throw it yet.
[217:37.01]Throw it now.
[217:49.01]That don't count.
[217:53.89]I think that counts.
[217:54.55]I don't know about that one.
[218:03.00]That was pretty good.
[218:07.84]Perform at the pub with the ribbon on.
[218:09.16]Isn't that impossible?
[218:16.03]No, I have to get it and walk all the way around.
[218:20.50]Where is the ribbon?
[218:25.10]It's stuck... It goes in the bush over here, right?
[218:28.31]Oh, alright.
[218:28.83]No, let's see.
[218:29.53]I can do that.
[218:30.31]Let's go!
[218:51.52]Alright, she sees.
[218:52.38]Isn't this kind of sad?
[219:00.64]Like, I want to be the thing that she loves.
[219:20.64]I'm the real one.
[219:22.04]It's me.
[219:24.51]And I'm taking it away, throwing it away, standing there, showing her, I want to be your friend!
[219:29.59]This is sad.
[219:59.84]Shit, she saw me.
[220:18.66]Just, just put the fucking thing on my neck, please.
[220:45.33]It's right next to me.
[220:46.19]No, stand there.
[220:46.96]What are you doing?
[220:47.44]Don't move.
[220:47.86]She just puts the sock over my beacon head.
[220:53.84]Perfect.
[220:55.66]Don't see it.
[220:56.17]Don't see it.
[220:56.65]Don't see it.
[220:57.15]Don't see it.
[220:57.77]Don't see it.
[221:01.15]Don't see it.
[221:02.31]Yeah.
[221:20.28]I'm holding it in so bad.
[221:21.54]I want to do it so bad.
[221:40.11]So now I have to go all the way back.
[221:50.48]Almost the whole way, right?
[221:52.64]Well, not all the way.
[221:56.34]Can I get there from here?
[221:57.38]Because then if I wrap around this way, here's the pub.
[222:19.71]Good to go.
[222:25.04]Does the person not deliver, you know?
[222:31.02]Oh.
[222:38.54]His ass is still all red.
[222:52.22]Why is it covered in blood?
[222:53.94]Because there was this crazy, weird, really, really kind of screwed up part of the game where you put a bunch of glass down.
[223:00.66]You break a bunch of glass bottles and you make him walk in the room and you scare him and he lands and he just sits on them.
[223:05.30]It's horrible.
[223:05.90]It's kind of out of place in a game like this, weirdly.
[223:09.44]I don't know.
[223:25.09]Alright, excuse me.
[223:28.88]I have some performing to do.
[223:34.46]I've got the ribbon.
[223:36.24]I'm ready for my close-up.
[223:40.31]Woohoo!
[224:34.03]I'm sorry.
[225:03.80]you
[226:37.43]I'm done with the game, I think.
[226:38.17]I think that's the end of the game.
[226:45.39]I've done what I wanted to do.
[226:48.05]That was very fun.
[226:48.85]That was a great... What about the mail?
[226:50.15]That's one thing.
[226:50.61]There's probably a secret with the mail, right?
[227:05.06]There are a lot of random stuff.
[227:06.38]Look at all those.
[227:06.88]Where's the secret menu?
[227:08.92]Doesn't even show up.
[227:10.96]What about the boat?
[227:11.61]Oh, wait.
[227:14.19]I'll try that.
[227:17.91]You just wanted an excuse to do your funny voices.
[227:22.29]Oh, yeah.
[227:22.73]I had to do my voices.
[227:29.62]I'll get the boat.
[227:30.38]I have to let it go in the water?
[227:31.46]I guess.
[227:35.77]Okay, is this a cartoon?
[227:37.98]If I remove the no duck sign, does that mean the ducks... I can go in there?
[227:53.20]Looks like ducks are allowed in here.
[227:55.53]No problem at all.
[227:58.09]If only there was a sign that said no ducks can come in here.
[228:01.67]I would not even have attempted.
[228:06.61]Alright, well I gotta sneak in.
[228:13.01]No!
[228:13.53]No!
[228:13.77]Get out!
[228:21.12]I'm not going near that box if I'm you.
[228:34.46]Take this box back?
[228:36.86]For what?
[228:43.39]Catch an object.
[228:44.15]Get thrown over the fence.
[228:45.19]Dress up with things.
[228:46.45]Steal the old man's wooden hat.
[228:48.01]So there are speedruns.
[228:53.23]To be thrown over the... I don't think I can take this.
[229:01.83]Can I take this?
[229:07.52]What kind of magic trick did we just do?
[229:09.96]That was an axe.
[229:13.44]Huh?
[229:13.58]Alright, I'm just gonna leave.
[229:24.47]Here we go.
[229:29.44]Use her to get thrown over the fence.
[229:48.70]Really?
[229:53.53]Alright.
[229:54.85]Um... I need the toy boat.
[230:18.87]I'm not even in there anymore.
[230:20.06]Don't worry.
[230:20.54]What, I can't get on the first step?
[230:22.92]I'm not allowed to step on the first step?
[230:26.04]That's not even your place of business.
[230:30.02]Shut up.
[230:35.37]Did it fall?
[230:37.73]That's enough falling.
[230:38.43]Fall down.
[230:43.93]Alright, I got the, uh...
[230:49.25]You're just really pissing me off now.
[230:51.83]I'm just gonna go right for the knife.
[231:09.56]Well, I almost got Toy Boat.
[231:14.21]It was close.
[231:14.73]It was close.
[231:32.40]Let me see if I can, um, I'm only gonna do this, like, one more time.
[231:36.16]I just, I'd warm it up.
[231:38.46]Let me see if I can do this, like, three or four times fast.
[231:40.18]It was pretty good.
[232:01.49]It's closed.
[232:06.85]Please give me the boat.
[232:08.69]Please give me the boat.
[232:10.01]Please give me the boat.
[232:11.21]Please give me the boat.
[232:12.05]I just want the boat.
[232:12.65]That's all I care about.
[232:17.42]No, she's going for the boat.
[232:24.30]I gotta break shit.
[232:24.80]I have to drop stuff all over the place.
[232:27.32]I gotta make a mess.
[232:34.90]I made it easier.
[232:35.56]Oh, my God.
[232:37.52]Fucking piece of shit.
[232:39.66]No, I don't... I didn't... I... Yes, I put a plate down one level.
[232:47.58]I know.
[232:48.48]Alright.
[232:49.13]I should have it.
[232:59.37]Alright.
[232:59.75]Toy boat goes in the... What was that?
[233:15.17]Keep this guy is the hardest enemy it keeps kicking me out Alright now I just gonna put it in make it go under a bridge This bridge right here
[233:44.79]Sail the toy boat under a bridge.
[233:53.30]Which way is the water flowing?
[234:33.01]Aha!
[234:33.25]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[234:35.44]Get thrown over the fence.
[234:39.40]And I'm in the water, though.
[234:40.26]Kind of went all the way back, didn't I?
[234:51.13]Whatever works.
[234:51.89]That's true.
[234:58.23]I still... Can I not... Can I not go in here?
[235:04.55]Alright, I'm gonna hide that there.
[235:05.43]That's fine.
[235:09.92]Alright.
[235:10.73]That might be it.
[235:11.79]That might be time.
[235:53.06]I was trying to get it as close to being in without it going in.
[235:57.84]Rake in the lake!
[235:58.55]There you go.
[235:59.01]The thing you wanted to see so bad.
[236:00.61]I don't know why.
[236:01.41]Why is that the thing in this game?
[236:05.39]Why is that the thing?
[236:12.09]Oh, okay.
[236:16.51]Wait, what?
[236:17.15]Did I even examine this stuff?
[236:21.62]I got my collection of cans, and... I want- I kinda want another one of these games.
[236:28.43]I want another one.
[236:33.93]Right?
[236:36.33]I wanna- I- I want another game like this.
[236:39.41]I'm hungry for more.
[236:44.22]Can this be one of those stories where the developer made this just goofy game, and, oh, that was fun, just a funny little game?
[236:52.93]And then they get, like, three million dollars in funding to do it again.
[237:00.11]Do it with different animals.
[237:01.15]Yeah.
[237:03.53]Do it like a bear.
[237:05.48]Untitled bear game.
[237:06.64]What would... Wait.
[237:07.58]Probably not.
[237:10.70]As a rat?
[237:12.98]You can make a lot of fun scenarios.
[237:19.23]Instead of the little squeak, it's that loud bear scream.
[237:24.37]I would love to just eat out of people's trash.
[237:28.09]And by the way, I'm gonna give you a... I'm gonna call the back of the box.
[237:33.71]The tell us how we're doing comments that's on the back of... Randomly, for some reason, like drinks and sodas and shit.
[237:39.75]You know, remember that stuff?
[237:41.47]Alright, there's a honk button, there's a grab button, there needs to be also a swallow button.
[237:46.02]We need to be able to eat this stuff.
[237:48.68]Like, I need to be able to chew this.
[237:51.05]And swallow it and eat it.
[237:51.97]That'd be fun.
[238:02.62]No, no dedicated shit button.
[238:04.26]That's not what I mean.
[238:05.10]I want to be able to just chew stuff up.
[238:07.24]I want to be able to pull the slipper off the guy's foot and just chew it up.
[238:15.51]Have I ever played the cat lateral damage?
[238:17.73]I actually have.
[238:18.41]I like this more than that, though.
[238:21.25]That game is more just to make a mess for 30 seconds.
[238:24.93]This is just walk around and be a duck.
[238:29.72]And this is more charming to me than the goat simulator was.
[238:32.90]You know, I'm gonna give you a stamp of recommendation on this one.
[238:42.89]It's cute.
[238:44.33]It's cute enough.
[238:48.94]But that is probably... It's actually probably gonna do it for today.
[238:51.22]I have a couple things I need to get done.
[238:54.22]I have to get ready for TwitchCon.
[238:59.15]I have to pack.
[239:02.31]I am going to stream tomorrow.
[239:08.42]So... This is not just the only stream you're gonna get this week.
[239:20.00]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[239:21.38]Tomorrow is kind of also up in the air.
[239:23.24]This was just a random game that turned out.
[239:25.70]I had a lot of fun.
[239:26.52]This is great.
[239:27.84]Tomorrow is going to be similar, though.
[239:28.94]I don't really have much of a plan.
[239:30.24]I haven't really been around.
[239:32.29]I just kind of got back.
[239:35.85]I've been out of the... I don't even know what games have come out.
[239:40.07]I don't even know what's released in the last week and a half or so.
[239:45.27]So we'll do something for at least a good five, six hours tomorrow.
[239:49.24]Before I have to leave.
[239:55.44]I'll figure it out.
[239:57.38]Community content stream tomorrow.
[239:59.00]I don't think so.
[240:01.52]I think it's too early for that.
[240:03.00]I want to give people at least a few weeks.
[240:04.40]At least a month or so to really get the first one nice and meaty.
[240:10.35]We'll figure it out.
[240:12.15]But again, I want to make this very clear too.
[240:15.15]My stream schedule is pulling back.
[240:17.99]Remember?
[240:20.23]Four or five months ago when I talked about after the carnival stream.
[240:23.58]I was going to start to pull the streams back an hour or two.
[240:29.06]Streams are going to be starting... An hour or two earlier than they have been.
[240:36.10]So instead of like three to four Pacific, it's going to be somewhere around like two.
[240:40.39]Like one to two Pacific.
[240:45.98]So, between like 4 and 5 Eastern is where I want the streams to start from now on.
[240:53.70]And I've talked about a little bit more of the streams because I'm on Pacific time.
[240:57.18]If I stream until like 10, 11, 12 at night, it's really, really late for everybody.
[241:06.07]If people watch from Europe, it's like 6 o'clock in the morning.
[241:10.01]Eastern time, it's like 2, 3 o'clock in the morning.
[241:12.56]So I'm going to pull it back.
[241:16.33]And with that, guys, we are going to transition to... Hold on a second.
[241:33.28]Hold on.
[241:40.89]The new outro screen!
[241:45.05]Thanks for coming, everybody.
[241:47.63]Appreciate everybody's, uh, coming in.
[241:51.31]Good shit.
[241:51.87]Oops, I fucked it up.
[241:53.23]I screwed it up.
[241:54.91]You weren't supposed to see that.
[241:58.01]Hold on.
[241:58.32]There we are.
[242:00.02]Everybody, welcome to... Please don't throw your popcorn at the screen.
[242:03.52]I appreciate it if you wouldn't.
[242:04.80]Please make a formal exit on the left side.
[242:08.42]There are your exits.
[242:14.40]and uh thanks for coming out I need to figure out how this works because this is the first time I've tried it don't throw tomatoes at me either either hold on Peter let me figure this out because this like this name's up here I don't think this is I think I screwed this up
[242:44.90]Did I screw this up?
[242:45.82]Maybe not.
[242:52.78]Oh, I definitely messed it up somehow.
[242:55.80]I'll figure it out next time.
[243:00.17]But... This will have... All the... The highest... Bit tip of the day.
[243:09.47]Whoever gave the highest.
[243:11.91]And then on the right side, it'll be whoever gave the most during that period.
[243:15.76]And then the top subgifter on the left.
[243:18.38]I actually might try to cycle these out too.
[243:20.82]Maybe I'll do, like, today's bit leader.
[243:24.34]And then have, like, longest running sub or something.
[243:31.27]Like, top subgifting.
[243:32.31]So many people give gifted subs that it's almost like it's its own category.
[243:40.75]$10,000.
[243:48.25]But this also, this track... Loredal made all this.
[243:51.71]I've been sitting on it for a while.
[243:54.11]I love this.
[243:54.77]This song is great.
[243:59.55]I will get these correct.
[244:02.29]Here's the cool thing about this though.
[244:08.26]Everybody has left!
[244:16.90]See you later, guys.
[244:18.58]Only a few of you still in here.
[244:20.34]I can also get rid of those people, too.
[244:24.98]It's a rat!
[244:33.37]Then we can hang out here.
[244:36.03]By the way, the screen up there, I can drop the music and we can put something up there.
[244:41.49]Like, pictures, random videos, stuff like that.
[244:50.74]How cool is this, though?
[244:52.80]The Jerma Plexus Cinema.
[244:54.06]There he is.
[244:56.62]The janitor.
[244:59.66]I could do my webcam in there, too.
[245:00.88]There's the rat.
[245:10.43]Still cleaning up.
[245:13.65]And then Tanner can finish up over here and then take a look at this.
[245:22.80]It's over.
[245:26.76]Why are we inside of your mouth?
[245:28.73]That's a great question.
[245:29.91]So this is the first of quite a few of these.
[245:40.35]I got to get back in touch with Blordow and we'll do the next few parts.
[245:43.65]There's going to be a lot of tracks, a lot of audio, a bunch of new transition scenes.
[245:49.83]I'm trying to really get it going.
[245:54.89]But yeah, I will figure out how I messed that up somehow.
[246:00.26]RIP the old outro.
[246:02.76]That is not true.
[246:05.26]It's still here.
[246:12.94]Because that plays when the stream is actually over.
[246:20.99]And we can come back over to here while we just hang out.
[246:32.23]I do want to add a bunch of things.
[246:36.12]But these are fucking fantastic as they are now.
[246:43.98]Get a couple more scenes in here.
[246:45.36]Some more cleanup.
[246:55.68]My burping is annoying?
[246:56.82]What do you mean?
[246:57.36]Burp my burping?
[247:03.07]Need to hire a new janitor?
[247:05.11]No.
[247:06.73]Did the intro screen change?
[247:07.97]Not yet.
[247:08.45]I plan on doing a whole thing.
[247:11.79]But...
[247:14.13]Why don't we do the bits Thanks everybody for watching that's gonna be it The transition is scary well good So all of you get to get out of here I Love that all the every ball the people leave in the theater.
[247:38.52]I
[247:43.76]These actually need to be switched around.
[247:47.71]They all came back in.
[247:48.79]And I can leave that up for as long as I want to.
[247:55.75]But, why don't we go ahead and go back earlier today.
[248:03.84]Thank you everybody again.
[248:05.04]First stream back from the carnival.
[248:07.88]I'll see you tomorrow.
[248:08.86]We'll do something else before I go to TwitchCon.
[248:11.96]And then I'm on another fucking airplane.
[248:16.31]It is what it is, though.
[248:18.83]Busy, but excited to be busy.
[248:25.83]What's up?
[248:28.53]Thank you to... Where we at?
[248:31.77]There was so much money given earlier, too.
[248:34.12]Like, a ridiculous amount.
[248:41.53]Thank you to Bake Me Home for the $15.
[248:45.09]We both know this is for the Carnival stream.
[248:46.74]That was insane.
[248:47.48]I'm glad you delivered.
[248:49.30]Can you tell us what you said to Ster back in the Jerma Watch's old video stream?
[248:52.36]You told him something about Mutant Star.
[248:53.80]I said there's no way that's working.
[248:56.64]I believe I told him how many games were going to be played, and I think I told him how much money it cost.
[249:04.76]I believe that's what I told him.
[249:12.39]But thank you for the $15.
[249:13.31]I appreciate it.
[249:14.43]That's... You're under no obligation to pay me money for the carnival.
[249:19.27]I did it because I wanted to, right?
[249:24.18]Smellyboy, thanks for the $2.50.
[249:25.38]Goose Game is Goat Simulator 2019 Edition.
[249:28.10]I disagree.
[249:29.34]I disagree.
[249:36.82]I think it's a little more charming.
[249:39.09]Flugboy, thanks for the five community subs.
[249:42.64]Appreciate it.
[249:44.42]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[249:48.26]That was Flugboy.
[249:50.88]Also, Zake, thanks for the $2.50.
[249:52.30]One time I was at the beach skipping rocks and eating a sandwich, and I threw my sandwich in the ocean and bit the rock.
[250:00.12]I hope your teeth are okay.
[250:01.26]That sounds like it hurts.
[250:06.25]Sorry to hear that.
[250:12.22]Wolfgang, thanks for the five dollars, Wolfgang.
[250:14.08]Jerma, you better have, um, ex-vacation John Adams and me in the next Jerma Rumble.
[250:22.31]And me.
[250:24.89]There are a lot of characters now.
[250:27.67]I told you that there was going to be another Jerma wrestling event before the end of the year, and I still mean that.
[250:33.50]So.
[250:35.46]There's a lot to choose from now.
[250:39.72]Got my new favorite character, Toothprick.
[250:49.78]Is it going to be a Christmas stream?
[250:52.42]I don't know.
[250:53.22]I don't know.
[250:53.82]I don't really plan on it.
[250:57.40]If I have an idea for something that I think is fun, I'll do it.
[251:02.94]I would assume it'll be something.
[251:06.64]I've done a Christmas-themed thing that was an elaborate thing the last two years in a row, so I kind of have to make it three in a row, right?
[251:14.72]We'll see.
[251:17.36]PJFFS, thanks for the five community subs earlier.
[251:20.58]I missed it.
[251:25.76]Thank you.
[251:28.96]Thank you to Peaceful Haley for the 250.
[251:30.34]Hey, Jeremy, happy birthday.
[251:31.82]You're getting pretty old.
[251:33.12]But you still look the ripe young age of 33.
[251:35.92]Hope it was a good birthday.
[251:38.36]It was.
[251:41.72]It was great.
[251:45.16]Yeah, I don't look a day older than 33.
[251:48.98]34, by the way, yes.
[251:51.50]Yes, I'm 34 years old.
[251:57.10]35 is the real... The one that sits in your brain and you just go, that's old.
[252:02.84]Between 30 and 35, you got time to still... I'm gonna say it again.
[252:09.16]Every drop-down menu that you can think of where you have to pick your age range, it's always 18 to 34.
[252:17.46]I don't get to be a kid anymore at 35.
[252:19.76]I have to go up to 35 to 55.
[252:24.55]That's not going to feel nice.
[252:29.65]That's less than a year away.
[252:35.75]Oh well.
[252:37.95]Tridentjacks.
[252:38.65]Thanks for the five community subs, Tridentjacks.
[252:42.44]You're getting out of your own demographic.
[252:44.68]Haha.
[252:47.42]Don't say that.
[252:48.06]Don't say that too loud.
[252:51.16]But thanks for the five subs, Trident.
[252:54.14]U50.
[252:55.90]Or UFO.
[252:58.44]U50.
[253:00.20]Thanks for the four dollars.
[253:02.36]My favorite Elberton boy streaming again.
[253:06.17]For now.
[253:08.27]Tomorrow, also streaming.
[253:09.59]And then TwitchCon.
[253:11.85]I won't be streaming at TwitchCon.
[253:13.35]I will be there.
[253:15.71]But I won't be streaming from TwitchCon.
[253:19.30]And when I get back, we will get back to normal for a little while.
[253:29.04]Nothing major is really planned in October.
[253:32.37]Besides maybe a Halloween.
[253:33.85]Maybe we'll play some scary games or something.
[253:37.75]But we're gonna go back to normal for a while.
[253:44.03]It's been a busy few months.
[253:47.15]Thank you, Grimmy, for the $5.
[253:48.97]I went through some really tough emotional things recently and your videos helped me through them so much.
[253:54.87]Thank you.
[253:56.81]Whatever it is they were, I'm really sorry to hear that.
[254:04.00]Thank you so much for the $5.
[254:04.82]I'm glad you like the videos and the content.
[254:13.48]And the community, too.
[254:17.03]This is a great community.
[254:17.85]People here are great.
[254:21.31]It's pretty fucking rare.
[254:24.91]Don't forget that.
[254:25.55]It's important.
[254:28.97]But, seriously, thank you so much for the five bucks.
[254:33.21]Oh, right.
[254:33.74]I'm sorry.
[254:34.12]I'm supposed to be putting things here.
[254:41.92]I gotta make some stuff to put in there.
[254:48.70]You need to shave.
[254:50.90]My face can, that's right.
[254:55.16]Streamlabs OBS is kind of weird.
[254:56.78]I have to figure out how to do this stuff.
[254:58.26]Because when you add a source, the source already exists.
[255:05.37]I think it's going to take some getting used to.
[255:12.90]Oh, yes, by the way, this is how I've been sitting in here for a very long time.
[255:20.06]I'm just realizing this right now.
[255:26.41]So, uh... This is a fucking skit.
[255:30.57]This is a weird movie.
[255:34.87]Hey, all of you.
[255:37.46]Come back in the theater.
[255:38.38]It's not done yet.
[255:48.78]We had Alchemy Can.
[255:52.04]Thousand bits from Alchemy Can.
[255:53.39]Ten bucks.
[255:54.97]Thanks for the carnival, man.
[255:56.09]Here's for you and your team's work.
[255:57.99]We all appreciate it.
[256:01.67]A lot of time went into that and a lot of people were involved.
[256:04.77]Just the robots alone.
[256:06.94]Trying to figure out what I wanted to do.
[256:10.98]And could that translate to actually have it on video and camera?
[256:18.64]When we were setting up the inputs, I remember just going to one of the engineers.
[256:24.62]I was like, so how much can that handle?
[256:29.94]How much can you actually handle in this thing?
[256:32.00]How many inputs per second?
[256:33.24]I was like, because it's probably going to be like, it's probably going to be like a thousand inputs a second.
[256:42.02]And all I remember is his eyes kind of widening and him going, oh shit, okay, so we should, let me see if I can figure that out.
[256:51.03]God.
[256:52.80]I think that it really, and that was by the way, probably two or three hours before the stream started.
[256:59.00]Because we were planning on thinking of how we were going to do it.
[257:01.69]Should I have sub only turned on?
[257:03.75]No, I don't really want to do that.
[257:05.43]Because that's, I'd rather have as many people participate as possible because it's more chaotic, right?
[257:09.87]It's more fun that way.
[257:11.33]But do I need to mitigate the amount of inputs that come in because the machines physically cannot take it?
[257:21.28]Chat went so fast my feed was buffering.
[257:23.24]Yeah.
[257:24.82]I put on a little slow-mo just to try to help.
[257:27.98]There was a couple of points when I think you guys broke the server they were connected to.
[257:32.23]And that's when I had to kill time for like 10 straight minutes sometimes.
[257:40.59]But it was worth it.
[257:44.35]It was worth it.
[257:46.43]There was more than 16,000 people there, I know.
[257:48.44]There's a rat!
[257:53.93]Yeah, I think it was almost at 16,500, 17,000 concurrent.
[257:59.06]That's the highest I've ever had, ever.
[258:01.30]I think it just blew, it completely blew it away.
[258:07.60]Where did you find those clowns?
[258:14.93]They were in the area.
[258:19.63]The old one was like 12k.
[258:23.17]Yeah.
[258:24.57]No, it blew past my previous high of viewers that came in.
[258:30.56]And a lot of new people, too.
[258:31.82]And even... I mean, if you're new here, even today... There was like 6,200, 6,300 people here today.
[258:41.65]That's a lot of new viewers, I think.
[258:43.29]So hopefully you like it here.
[258:46.71]Maybe you were just checking out the stream I followed just to see what it was all about.
[258:51.47]Hopefully we see you again.
[258:53.64]Because... There was a lot of new people here, I think, today.
[259:02.69]Yeah, I'm talking about the old... What the record was to break the old one.
[259:06.65]Viewership-wise.
[259:12.92]The official Twitch... Yeah, I saw the tweet, too.
[259:18.32]They tweeted it out, and they censored it, too.
[259:20.90]That's my favorite part.
[259:23.56]It's like, you'll never dunk me.
[259:25.59]You'll never do it.
[259:27.11]And then I like get dunked.
[259:28.17]I said like the F word fucking three times.
[259:33.33]They like cut out the swear.
[259:35.33]It's alright, whatever.
[259:36.37]I got to clean up my act a little bit anyways.
[259:41.63]Is the stream ending?
[259:42.35]Yes, this is the new stream wind down screen.
[259:46.54]There's going to be more additions to this.
[259:47.96]We're going to add more stuff.
[259:49.74]What happens if I do this?
[259:52.94]Oh, I'm gone.
[259:54.41]Now you can't see me at all.
[259:57.99]Remind him to cut his nails.
[259:58.85]Thank you.
[260:00.65]I'm okay with being... Look.
[260:02.95]I'm okay with being toothpick guy.
[260:05.58]But I'm not okay with being long nails guy.
[260:08.96]Because that's something that people talk about because you're gross.
[260:12.72]Right?
[260:12.92]I don't want to do that.
[260:19.55]So.
[260:20.59]You know.
[260:22.27]Alright, let me go back to where we were.
[260:26.41]Cool, cool, cool.
[260:27.57]Make sure I didn't miss anything from here up.
[260:33.05]Got that.
[260:33.71]Got that that came in.
[260:36.48]It was Alchemy Can.
[260:37.28]That's what it was for a thousand bits.
[260:38.48]Thank you, Alchemy Can.
[260:39.30]We had Cocoronas for five dollars.
[260:41.34]Do you remember where you got those toy frogs in the frog game?
[260:45.56]Um...
[260:47.66]No, that was actually Andy Mark.
[260:50.44]Andy Mark had those.
[260:53.06]So, because they were doing testing on how heavy things needed to be.
[260:57.82]And apparently those frogs were the perfect weight to launch.
[261:01.97]So, I'm not exactly sure where they got them.
[261:05.01]All I know is that frogs needed to be involved.
[261:08.67]Because, you know, I'm a frog.
[261:12.81]I'm a rat.
[261:14.27]I'm a frog.
[261:14.81]I'm a rat.
[261:15.37]I like both those animals.
[261:16.37]I think toads are cool, too.
[261:20.75]No, I'm not turning the light on.
[261:21.85]This is how it's going to be.
[261:23.63]I'm going to be the weird floating head.
[261:28.69]Goats are cool, too.
[261:29.49]I like goats.
[261:30.03]I like geese.
[261:31.97]After today, I mean, I really do.
[261:35.75]But yeah, Andy Mark supplied those, so I'm not sure exactly where they got them.
[261:39.13]But thank you, Trident Jacks, for the $5.00.
[261:42.89]Didn't leave much of my last cheer.
[261:44.09]Just wanted to say how much you've positively affected my life.
[261:46.77]Thank you for being you.
[261:48.31]Much love.
[261:48.85]It's amazing how you continue to grow and evolve with your comedy while you still remain completely insane.
[261:54.11]While still remaining completely insane.
[261:56.85]Much love.
[262:03.86]I just kind of do the things that I'm going to do.
[262:10.11]I look like Snoke from The Last Jedi.
[262:26.72]Young.
[262:27.08]I'm going to be young Snoke.
[262:34.33]But anyways, thank you for the $5 Trident Jacks.
[262:41.58]If I can be a positive influence or affect you positively, that's... I'm floored and I'm shocked.
[262:49.46]I'm happy that you can get anything out of this at all.
[262:52.62]Anything.
[262:56.08]It surprises me every day that I am a positive influence to some people.
[263:04.21]I hope you turned it into something good, right?
[263:06.59]Like, I hope you turned it into something good.
[263:12.68]Influencer.
[263:13.26]I don't like that word.
[263:14.52]I like the term... What was it?
[263:18.88]Sidewalk clown?
[263:19.72]What was it?
[263:20.64]What came up with the term?
[263:24.64]Sidewalk clown, right?
[263:25.88]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[263:26.40]That's what it was.
[263:29.30]But... Yes.
[263:32.35]Thank you, Fat Hector, for the thousand bits.
[263:35.47]$10 from Fat Hector.
[263:36.23]Hey, Jerma, the Carnival Stream seemed too good to be free.
[263:40.53]So here's what I can give.
[263:41.65]Thanks for the laughs.
[263:42.57]Carnival Stream... I would not have put a payment on that.
[263:49.80]There's no way I would have done that.
[263:52.06]I wanted as many people to come check it out as possible.
[263:55.48]I'm not putting a...
[263:59.05]pay to watch or pay to participate.
[264:01.45]I just, I don't want to do that.
[264:03.91]I'd rather have as many people as possible see it.
[264:06.91]That's more important to me than trying to make extra money, I guess?
[264:10.91]I don't really, that doesn't... Could I have, like, sub-gated that or something?
[264:16.73]But what the fuck do I care, you know what I mean?
[264:19.33]I'd rather have people watch it than have it be sub-gated or something.
[264:28.08]Uh, more publicity.
[264:32.16]Yeah, I mean, I guess.
[264:34.92]That's not what I was thinking of when I wanted to do this, though.
[264:37.28]It was not, how do I, I want to get all of it everywhere.
[264:39.41]How do I get on the front page of every page?
[264:42.81]That just was something that I wanted to do.
[264:47.91]But, I'm happy it was received well.
[264:50.61]I'm very happy.
[264:52.98]I mean, if it was received really poorly, then that's a completely different story.
[264:57.90]And then I have to come up here and embarrassingly turn this stream on.
[265:02.09]And it's like, yep.
[265:06.57]Didn't really work out that well now, did it?
[265:08.57]So I'm glad it went well.
[265:12.99]But thank you, Fat Hector.
[265:14.67]Appreciate it.
[265:17.18]Uh, Jerma Saved the Game gave $5.
[265:19.68]Is Jerma Saved the Game?
[265:22.40]You remind me of Saved the Game.
[265:23.98]Alright.
[265:24.83]Local eccentric millionaire arrested and declared insane after hiring a full production crew to film himself completely alone in his illegal backyard carnival.
[265:33.09]When interviewed, he stated that 10,000 people were in attendance, despite neighbors' claims to the contrary.
[265:51.54]Well, I mean, they technically were 10,000 people not in attendance, but in digital attendance.
[265:58.06]Digital attendance.
[266:00.32]So, that still counts.
[266:09.11]Backyard illegal carnival.
[266:12.31]Hey, Jerma Light of Elkway, thanks for the $2.50.
[266:14.69]Jerma peaked at 4'6".
[266:18.96]Just, I'll see you at TwitchCon, and I'll fucking be taller than you.
[266:24.66]I shouldn't say that, because that's not true.
[266:25.96]But I won't be as tall, I won't be as short as you think I am.
[266:33.69]Hey, Infinity Rees, thanks for the six dollars, all the bits I own, just to make the echo stop.
[266:42.02]Make the echo stop.
[266:46.28]Was that the goose thing?
[266:53.86]Was it when my head was in the thing?
[266:56.48]Make it stop!
[266:57.16]I didn't do anything!
[267:02.22]But thank you for the six dollars.
[267:04.16]600 bits!
[267:06.00]That was five hours ago.
[267:07.12]Yes, it was.
[267:07.63]It was a long time ago, so... That's true.
[267:10.53]But thank you, Infinity Rez.
[267:12.75]I'm gonna call you Infinity Rez.
[267:14.01]Or it's Infinity Reez.
[267:15.65]Stop throwing tomatoes!
[267:18.45]You can't have very many left.
[267:22.25]Oh, Muffin, thanks for the five dollars, 500 bits.
[267:27.53]I love how dedicated you are to making people laugh.
[267:29.34]You're honestly my favorite streamer.
[267:30.68]Thank you for helping me out in hard times and just being you.
[267:36.26]Yeah, I'm... I would say I'm more dedicated to... trying to have a good time.
[267:45.41]You know, I put... How do we collectively have a good time?
[267:51.95]I don't know, let me think, right?
[267:54.58]If I come up with something that I think will solve that riddle, then let's go.
[268:04.94]Like I said, that's not the last time you're going to see something like that.
[268:07.42]That's the first time.
[268:08.58]And not even the first time.
[268:09.50]We've done stuff like that before.
[268:12.39]Not to that scale, but we've still done it.
[268:20.49]Phew.
[268:23.63]But yeah, I'm humbled and shocked every day, and thankful every day that there's people that think that this channel is funny.
[268:31.30]Enough to watch all the time, and to participate in crazy fucking ideas like I want a Twitch-controlled robot carnival.
[268:40.88]You know what I mean?
[268:42.65]I am absolutely fortunate that people think that this shit is still interesting.
[268:46.77]So, that's really what I have to say.
[268:52.11]You have to make the funny streamer noise now.
[268:54.40]Now, that only comes out when it comes out.
[268:55.86]I don't even control that.
[268:56.80]It just comes out.
[268:59.18]But that was, uh, OhMuffin.
[269:00.96]Thanks for the $5, 500 bits.
[269:02.90]DoorCube, thanks for the 250 bits.
[269:05.82]Recently rewatched a VOD in which I told you in a bit message that you had peaked with TF2 boxes.
[269:11.63]But how, howdy, was I wrong?
[269:14.01]You're not only a god of a gamer, but a god of an entertainer.
[269:18.35]Love you, Jerry.
[269:21.06]That was a good one, though.
[269:29.16]Jerry.
[269:32.58]I like the new setup.
[269:33.34]Yeah, I do too.
[269:34.24]I think it's great.
[269:37.10]I think it's very fun.
[269:38.70]I like the whole... You were watching in the theater kind of thing.
[269:43.99]10,000 of you were watching in this theater.
[269:46.25]Just don't... Just don't close your... But we are inside of the mouth.
[269:52.70]You're right.
[269:53.44]That... That's a mouth.
[269:59.19]Yeah.
[270:00.67]That's... That just put another layer on top for me.
[270:03.83]That was great.
[270:04.39]That's awesome.
[270:05.13]That's fucking awesome.
[270:06.43]Unbelievable.
[270:09.96]We are the mouth.
[270:10.92]You are... No, this is just inside of somebody's mouth.
[270:13.76]I don't know.
[270:14.20]Or an animal.
[270:14.78]It could be.
[270:16.20]We're just germs in here.
[270:17.36]Or you are.
[270:18.12]I mean, you're just... You opened some... Whoever this person is opened their mouth.
[270:22.64]And I'm standing in front of them just doing a show.
[270:25.70]And you guys are all in this person's mouth in seats.
[270:31.21]This person's been keeping their mouth open for a very long time.
[270:34.83]I'm the dentist.
[270:37.11]I'm the comedy dentist.
[270:39.01]Open up.
[270:42.72]I would be a pretty good dentist.
[270:43.74]No, I wouldn't.
[270:44.74]I'd be a terrible dentist.
[270:47.39]I got my hands, like, so shaky.
[270:48.83]I wouldn't be able to ever do anything like that.
[270:51.91]Get that stream nominated for an Emmy.
[270:53.29]I'm so fucking happy.
[270:53.90]I'm so happy that you guys liked it.
[271:15.11]There's always this little demon in the back of your head.
[271:22.32]That even when we got up to the day before, is just sitting there going, You know, this whole thing could just go completely fucking wrong.
[271:34.98]And nobody will think it's funny.
[271:36.98]And nobody will think it was interesting.
[271:38.70]And I'm just sitting there going, Get up!
[271:40.44]Get out of here!
[271:44.40]The ASMR demon.
[271:47.04]Now, obviously, there was so much that went into this that was not really on my brain at all.
[271:52.57]We were too busy and too focused on trying to get it together.
[271:56.15]And as time came forward, we realized that it was going to be a lot of fun.
[272:01.49]But it doesn't matter.
[272:02.27]I always just want to make sure that people, regardless of how much money the stream costs, it doesn't matter if it's that stream.
[272:07.31]It could be this stream, too.
[272:08.92]The one that you just watched.
[272:10.50]The one that you're on right now.
[272:13.75]You know, I just want to make sure that it's something fun.
[272:15.59]Something interesting.
[272:16.25]Something people don't take away.
[272:18.25]Something that they didn't like.
[272:20.39]Boy, that sucked.
[272:21.97]I don't want you to think that.
[272:22.93]Now go ahead and spit, please.
[272:26.82]Go ahead and rinse and spit.
[272:27.94]Now wait.
[272:29.24]And we're in a dark room, too.
[272:32.30]Imagine going to the dentist and it's this dark in here.
[272:41.79]Would you leave?
[272:42.23]Alright, what if it was like five star rated dentist on Yelp?
[272:48.94]Would you go to this dentist?
[272:52.08]Yeah?
[272:54.06]It turned out the dentist had this weird thing with like light.
[272:57.00]They just couldn't have light on.
[272:59.06]It was something with a... Some kind of condition or something.
[273:02.07]With light, you couldn't be in light.
[273:03.43]But he was like the best dentist in the world.
[273:04.77]Would you be in like a dark room dentist thing?
[273:09.61]Who rates dentists on Yelp?
[273:15.48]People raid every business on Yelp.
[273:18.84]Don't they?
[273:23.34]Where's the whale?
[273:27.14]Right here.
[273:32.81]Are those whiskers?
[273:35.67]Wait, does Wailord have whiskers or is that... No, that's the grill.
[273:39.57]Okay, that's like the whale's grill.
[273:43.31]Get some dogs on there.
[273:46.38]But anyways, what the hell was I just saying?
[273:49.08]I don't really, I have no idea.
[273:51.51]Thank you to RVM for the 5,000 bits.
[273:53.83]They said, yo, Merry Christmas.
[273:58.91]5,000 bits, $50 from RVM.

[274:34.82]Because I had to bring something.
[274:36.28]As much of a pain in the ass as that was to bring from airport to airport and carry it around and stuff in the terminals.
[274:43.09]I wanted to keep something from it.
[274:45.07]That was... I do have an Andy Mark goat as well.
[274:50.17]But I will never get rid of that.
[274:51.37]I'll have that forever.
[274:52.77]I really don't think I'll ever get rid of that.
[275:00.48]I told you.
[275:00.94]Now you have to delete that username.
[275:03.53]There's two or three people that have those usernames.
[275:07.09]Now you gotta... Now you gotta get rid of them.
[275:11.80]Where are the Pikachu socks?
[275:14.24]I wore them.
[275:17.14]That's all that matters.
[275:19.02]I wore them.
[275:20.06]And they were in that container.
[275:26.07]What about the goats?
[275:26.83]You can buy... Wait, are they still available?
[275:29.41]Can somebody confirm?
[275:30.29]Is that page sold out?
[275:32.44]Or can you actually still buy them?
[275:35.42]I know that they were... Somebody link that?
[275:41.49]Prove it?
[275:41.91]What do you mean prove it?
[275:45.17]Prove it?
[275:46.37]I wore them on stream for almost two hours.
[275:52.43]Yeah, they're still available.
[275:56.75]But, thank you for the 10,000 bits, R.V.M.
[276:00.15]Really appreciate it.
[276:03.62]Heat Legend, thanks for the thousand bits.
[276:06.00]Happy birthday, funny streamer man.
[276:07.94]Thank you.
[276:09.70]It was a good one.
[276:11.05]It was a good one.
[276:13.95]Growlithe, thanks for the five dollars.
[276:16.39]Only managed to watch the VOD of the carnival, but I loved every second of it.
[276:19.35]And I could tell you did too.
[276:21.61]Thank God your creativity didn't go to someone with their head up their ass.
[276:25.71]Love you, Jeremy.
[276:26.57]Jeremy Hart.
[276:29.80]Yeah, me too.
[276:32.14]Me too.
[276:35.41]Somebody that was working on the project actually brought something interesting up and they said, it's really awesome when everybody that is working on a project, and there were more than 10 people that had a hand in this.
[276:46.40]So every single person that was working on it
[276:50.49]having a great time and I was so that was insanely important to me was I want to make sure everybody is comfortable everyone's having a good time that everyone you're like passionate about this project and then you really really like it and you really want to give time to it and care about it and all of them did every single person that was there was just having such a blast and that's
[277:13.42]When it clicks like that, there was no scenario where it was, oh, I really gotta run this through this guy, and oh, I don't know about, I don't like what she said to me earlier, but at the set meeting, no, it was none of that.
[277:29.14]Zero.
[277:31.36]Oh, nobody was like, I'm gonna have to ask Jerma about this, and he's a fucking diva.
[277:36.74]He's probably gonna, like, take a swing at me.
[277:39.16]No.
[277:40.16]It was just fun.
[277:44.82]When people have egos like that for something creative, it's the worst.
[277:48.18]Yeah, I don't want that.
[277:49.24]That's, like, why... It's bad when that happens.
[277:55.74]I don't want that to happen.
[277:57.98]Maybe not to your face.
[278:00.74]They're all, like, at a... They're all, like, at dinner sitting around.
[278:03.55]Oh, man, that was horrible.
[278:06.53]He was the worst.
[278:08.97]With a capital W. Don't look straight into the camera.
[278:14.05]It's creepy.
[278:17.84]why I can't look over I can't look right I can't look you in the eye I can't look you in the eye when I'm talking to you turn around I mean I'm looking at chat but when I want when I address I'm not when I'm not addressing just one message boom we're up here and there you are I'm talking to you that's who I'm talking to
[278:53.14]Tell Blord how his work is lovely.
[278:55.44]I will.
[278:57.02]I will.
[278:58.12]If you didn't get to see it, here's the other one.
[279:04.15]This one's great.
[279:09.69]I love this.
[279:11.11]It's so wonderful.
[279:12.05]It's just so cute.
[279:16.20]But, thank you to... That was Growlithe.
[279:20.71]Everybody clicked.
[279:21.61]It was a great set.
[279:23.09]It was a great... Because we were kind of just absolutely just ass to the ground running.
[279:32.76]Since I left on that last stream, you saw me stream before the carnival.
[279:37.42]It was just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[279:40.00]Let's go.
[279:40.56]Let's get it done.
[279:46.99]I'm very happy with it.
[279:48.49]Ecstatic with it.
[279:51.49]And some of them are actually going to be at TwitchCon.
[279:53.22]So it was great.
[279:54.04]It was, hey, that was really fun.
[279:55.24]We worked on that.
[279:56.04]And you're going to be at TwitchCon?
[279:57.42]Are you serious?
[279:58.20]Nice.
[279:58.56]Let's hang out.
[280:00.82]I want to keep those relationships going.
[280:07.64]Thank you, Kitty Rocketeer, for the thousand bits.
[280:09.91]Jerma, that carnival was one of the best things I've ever seen.
[280:11.67]Thank you.
[280:12.83]I'm really glad you think so.
[280:16.41]Thank you Gnarly for the thousand bits as well.
[280:18.66]Carnival stream was a ton of fun.
[280:19.80]Loved every second of it.
[280:20.62]Thanks for being the best content creator on the site.
[280:23.08]Also, by the way, don't forget to cut your gross fucking nails before TwitchCon.
[280:26.72]Thank you.
[280:27.06]I would have forgot.
[280:28.22]Somebody did it 15 minutes ago.
[280:29.86]I would have just forgot.
[280:33.00]Thank you.
[280:36.01]That was Gnarly for a thousand bits.
[280:41.48]We also had OK Ice Cream for $2.50, 250 bits.
[280:47.12]Hi, Jerma.
[280:47.50]Me and my friend wanted to buy a goat, but shipping was like $70.
[280:49.84]Feels bad, man.
[280:53.14]Holy shit.
[280:55.55]Also, the carnival stream was amazing.
[280:56.89]I loved it. $70.
[281:04.45]Yeah, that ship, uh, shipping from America overseas always is an extra at least one to two to three hundred percent.
[281:16.86]Wherever it's going, I wish I could change it, but that's another reason why I like to keep my t-shirts cheaper.
[281:26.59]I like to keep all my t-shirts at like 18 to 22 dollars.
[281:30.57]Because I know you're gonna spend like 30 fucking dollars to have it shipped to you if you're from another country.
[281:40.26]So I completely understand.
[281:42.35]Those of you that bought your shirts from EU, how much was the shipping?
[282:01.10]Is there an average?
[282:02.46]50?
[282:05.62]20?
[282:09.06]20 bucks?
[282:11.71]50 bucks?
[282:17.73]Two Roblox?
[282:20.51]Well, I think we got two actual answers in there.
[282:23.15]So... I think maybe even one.
[282:28.47]How many people hate this?
[282:29.35]It's like...
[282:31.00]3,200 people here and I get one real answer?
[282:38.83]Wow.
[282:43.19]Damn.
[282:44.67]Alright.
[282:46.27]But... Thank you again.
[282:48.39]That was, uh, okay ice cream.
[282:50.01]I'm really sorry that you have to spend that much money to get anything shipped.
[282:54.05]I wish shipping wasn't so ridiculous for some places.
[282:57.46]Hey, ovpeel, thanks for the $5.
[283:00.58]No message, just 500 bits.
[283:01.88]Eggjohnson, 500 bits.
[283:06.45]Hey Jerm, I've been watching since 2012 when I was like 15.
[283:09.87]And seriously, man, you've gotten better in your senior 60 plus years.
[283:14.07]You do some avant-garde shit and it's insanely inspiring.
[283:17.16]Also, how do I stop cutting myself with a safety razor?
[283:20.86]I do it every single time, but I've been using it for like two years.
[283:23.72]Well, here's the thing.
[283:26.12]You gotta be very, very gentle and careful.
[283:30.27]When you shave with a safety razor, you gotta let the weight of the blade do the work.
[283:34.56]You don't push.
[283:35.52]You don't drag.
[283:37.14]Let the weight of the blade do it.
[283:39.08]Slight angle.
[283:40.38]Gentle.
[283:41.92]I know that some people have places to be.
[283:44.61]You got ti- I don't wanna shave.
[283:46.41]It's gonna take 20 minutes to shave.
[283:48.91]Just relax and let- just work it.
[283:52.31]Gently.
[283:55.10]You don't have to go fast.
[283:57.60]When people shave their faces, that's why some of these brands, they do so well, because they have the 12 blades, and they have all the jelly shit all over it, and they've been engineered in a way to make it so you can shave your entire face in the same amount of time that it takes to brush your teeth.
[284:14.33]No, that should not be what you do.
[284:20.78]That's how you get irritation.
[284:29.40]More blades reduce irritation.
[284:34.90]I'm telling you.
[284:38.72]Just rip the hair out.
[284:41.43]More blades reduce irritation.
[284:43.17]Yeah, but they've been engineered and designed that way to make it so people just... I used to know somebody... This is fucking crazy, by the way.
[284:52.53]I'm not making this up.
[284:54.92]I knew somebody that shaved with water.
[284:59.03]And it was impossible to me.
[285:03.49]It was impossible.
[285:07.09]You shave with water?
[285:11.47]They had to have been lying.
[285:13.63]But it wasn't a situation where somebody was going to lie.
[285:17.83]It was just really randomly off the cuff, just not being pressed on it at all.
[285:21.81]They just mentioned it.
[285:23.83]We weren't even talking about shaving, really.
[285:28.55]Oh, I just used water.
[285:30.69]It just came out like, oh, we're talking about just, it randomly popped up somewhere.
[285:33.45]It wasn't like, I can't wait to lie about how I shaved my face.
[285:41.31]I used ketchup.
[285:46.65]Soap?
[285:47.15]Maybe they talk, maybe they do soap.
[285:49.09]I couldn't do that either, though.
[285:54.05]The soap and water?
[285:56.36]I would be so scared.
[285:59.16]I have to have a big Santa beard.
[286:02.10]Of cream.
[286:03.92]Before I even begin.
[286:17.18]I thought you meant they shaved literally using water, no blade.
[286:20.46]No, no.
[286:22.68]Like they put water on their face and shaved their face with the water on their face.
[286:34.73]That's not even possible.
[286:41.64]What's wrong with just using water?
[286:44.48]Are you... You shave with just water?
[286:47.88]You gotta fill us in.
[286:50.12]That freaks me out.
[286:53.14]Yes, you do.
[286:54.70]I do, I do.
[286:55.12]Yes, okay.
[286:55.48]Okay.
[286:57.63]How do you not tug?
[286:59.47]Doesn't it tug?
[287:00.21]It tugs, doesn't it?
[287:04.75]When you shave, it's like... You just do it.
[287:11.34]But... You just have to pressure the blade carefully.
[287:23.07]You just do it.
[287:28.97]I would never shave with just water.
[287:33.22]I would get to a point where I would... You can hear it.
[287:35.44]It goes like... And then you feel the tug.
[287:39.58]And I stop and I go, I'm not doing it!
[287:51.76]Yeah, I could never do it.
[287:54.84]But thank you, Egg Johnson, for the 500 bits.
[287:56.70]Appreciate it.
[288:02.77]Where does face go?
[288:03.71]Oh, it's gone.
[288:06.85]Let's do this.
[288:09.97]I love that little... I love the close-up of the janitor.
[288:13.85]That's wonderful.
[288:16.79]Hey, Miniclips, thanks for the thousand bits.
[288:18.51]Just use a lighter to burn off all the small hairs.
[288:21.09]Cheap and effective?
[288:23.77]Well, here's the thing.
[288:25.35]Cheap?
[288:25.87]Yes.
[288:27.03]Effective?
[288:28.49]No.
[288:29.79]Dangerous?
[288:30.37]Yes.
[288:31.98]Should I do this?
[288:32.84]No.
[288:34.74]Should you have read that message out loud?
[288:36.70]No.
[288:37.88]Did you do it anyways?
[288:39.17]Yes.
[288:40.67]Why?
[288:43.55]I don't know.
[288:43.91]I don't know.
[288:44.75]I don't know.
[288:45.21]I don't know.
[288:45.71]I don't know.
[288:49.28]No, just whatever razor you use, just be careful.
[288:56.13]It's still a blade.
[288:57.69]You just be careful with it.
[288:58.83]Be gentle.
[289:00.11]Take care of it.
[289:01.85]Use an adequate amount of cream.
[289:08.00]He doesn't know.
[289:08.72]What does he not know?
[289:14.41]What if you heated the razor?
[289:16.83]You kind of do.
[289:17.33]I run my razor over hot, hot, hot water.
[289:22.41]But what I do is I have a little thing where I just put hot water in it and just go... And so the blade is nice and warm and hot.
[289:30.71]Feels great.
[289:34.29]No, not glowing hot.
[289:36.78]You guys are fucking crazy.
[289:40.90]So there's a blowtorch and get it like red hot?
[289:44.22]You would just burn your face.
[289:46.43]Don't listen to the people in this chat.
[289:49.21]They're just being weirdos.
[289:57.36]It was one of the best streams I've ever been to.
[289:58.86]Thank you so much for doing it.
[289:59.66]Love you.
[290:15.26]Dancing out that energy.
[290:18.82]Nice.
[290:21.46]You know, it's been a long time since I've really danced out some energy.
[290:26.34]Maybe I'll... You know what?
[290:27.32]Maybe I'm gonna... I'm gonna dance at TwitchCon, okay?
[290:33.18]I'm gonna have the... I'm gonna be Toothprick and I'm gonna dance.
[290:39.09]And the second that somebody pulls up their camera to film me, I'm immediately gonna stop and just stare at them.
[290:54.94]One of you guys better get that out of him.
[290:58.24]Thank you, SadVegan with the 250.
[290:59.82]StreamerJerma985 dies from tragic toothpick-related accident.
[291:13.14]StreamerJerma985 is here right now.
[291:15.40]Fine.
[291:18.54]I don't think I can put... I don't think the word prick could be used in an emote.
[291:28.47]Sorry to say.
[291:29.01]But thank you, uh, Sad Vega.
[291:38.87]Thank you to Feitoru for the five dollars.
[291:41.33]They say honk.
[291:44.67]Honk.
[291:45.71]Thank you, Feitoru.
[291:48.69]Maverick, thanks for the thousand bits.
[291:51.14]Love your videos, man.
[291:52.58]Born and raised in Boston.
[291:54.36]I moved to the Cape.
[291:56.18]And now I'm stuck in the EU.
[291:58.75]Let's meet up and share a firm handshake.
[292:02.73]And cheers at Quincy Market.
[292:06.59]By the way, I have some bits.
[292:08.33]What are you doing in the EU?
[292:15.87]How'd you go?
[292:16.47]How'd you go from Boston to the Cape to EU?
[292:26.19]I wonder what that journey sounds like.
[292:35.39]But yeah, I do not live in Boston anymore.
[292:40.53]I live in Las Vegas.
[292:44.33]They're using fast travel.
[292:52.42]Viva Las Vegas, that's right.
[293:00.50]That's another thing, the internet.
[293:02.74]It's been pretty good.
[293:04.18]Almost no drop frames.
[293:05.22]Like, less than 500.
[293:05.86]That's pretty good.
[293:07.54]Nice.
[293:09.27]Hey, EvilCrucifix, thanks for 1500 bits.
[293:13.19]Never forget the seal left behind.
[293:16.61]Well, yeah.
[293:17.13]You guys gotta fill me in on this.
[293:18.27]Because I leaned into the chat and everyone was screaming during the stream.
[293:21.65]About seal, seal, seal.
[293:23.13]I don't know what that means.
[293:33.41]Didn't the carnival stream end because of Comcast?
[293:35.85]No, no, no, no.
[293:38.27]We just got to the end.
[293:39.07]No, there were no internet issues at all.
[293:45.02]He fell out of the claw machine.
[293:46.48]He bounced off the... Oh, okay.
[293:52.74]We grabbed a seal in the claw, but it dropped before dispensing.
[293:55.82]Oh, no.
[293:58.39]That's not good.
[294:01.57]That's too bad.
[294:02.31]You guys got a triple at the end.
[294:03.65]Your last grab was a triple.
[294:07.21]You guys were very good at that game.
[294:11.40]You guys reached down probably 20 to 30 times.
[294:14.36]And I think at least 10 to 15 times you picked something up.
[294:21.69]Go back and get the seal.
[294:25.07]Maybe I'll get it shipped to me.
[294:29.32]But thank you, EvilCruzFix, for the 1500 bits.
[294:34.30]Errorless, thanks for the 250.
[294:35.74]Your Larry David impression sucks.
[294:38.06]Not really, I'm just trying to trick you into doing the voice.
[294:43.04]When did I do a Larry David?
[294:45.63]Today?
[294:45.97]I don't know.
[294:51.07]Marvash Magali, thanks for the 500 bits.
[294:54.86]was planning to donate this during the carnival stream but ended up forgetting while in the middle of spamming commands that was for sure the best project you ever achieved I'm glad you got recognition you deserve for it keep it up and looking forward to the community content stream stay tuned that's all I gotta say we got way more to do there's so many more streams like that that I want to do that I've had
[295:21.80]ideas for for years, and now they're finally going to happen.
[295:28.33]Things I've never even talked about that are just sitting around waiting to be done.
[295:36.71]Stay tuned.
[295:37.99]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[295:40.96]Gimme20dollars gave 10 community subs, and Pinman gave 10 community subs back-to-back.
[295:45.66]I remember that.
[295:46.90]Thanks, both of you.
[295:51.04]And then we also had... I forgot this scene had my face on it.
[295:57.75]Welcome back.
[295:58.23]Hello.
[295:59.41]We also had... Uh... Okay, ice cream for 250 bits.
[296:05.65]Do you have any words of wisdom?
[296:07.90]Yes.
[296:11.66]Drink way more water than you do.
[296:14.24]Uh...
[296:16.47]Drink more water and eat better food.
[296:20.81]Eat better food.
[296:23.55]Better does not mean more expensive.
[296:25.27]Just eat better, drink more water, and eliminate some of the sugar from your diet.
[296:30.09]And you might not even know that you're consuming way too much sugar.
[296:35.11]Cut back a little on the sugar.
[296:36.53]It's not necessary.
[296:37.81]And eat some better food.
[296:42.41]And stretch every so often.
[296:43.77]That's right.
[296:45.06]Good call.
[296:46.66]Just eat better forehead.
[296:47.86]I mean, that, yeah.
[296:50.46]Supplement, look, instead of getting like the hamburger and french fries, get the hamburger and the broccoli.
[296:57.35]Instead of getting the hamburger, instead of getting the hamburger, get the fish.
[297:03.78]Not every time.
[297:05.16]Not every single time you go to the grocery store or you go to get food.
[297:09.75]But sometimes.
[297:10.91]Like once a week.
[297:13.09]McDonald's doesn't serve broccoli.
[297:14.29]You shouldn't be eating McDonald's more than once every six or seven years.
[297:18.39]I know this because I eat it two or three times a week.
[297:21.50]That's a lie.
[297:22.52]That would make a username.
[297:25.00]No, just honestly, without fucking around, just treat your body better.
[297:32.05]This is coming from somebody that didn't for a long time.
[297:34.81]I would drink fucking sodas.
[297:38.31]I'm talking like 15 years ago.
[297:41.27]It catches up with you.
[297:42.29]You just don't realize it.
[297:45.22]Cut out the sugar and drink more water.
[297:53.05]You better.
[297:55.45]I've just almost hurt myself by laughing again.
[297:58.59]Speaking of, like, health.
[298:01.09]I almost just laughed and hurt my stomach.
[298:05.47]Uh, anyways.
[298:05.89]A thank you to Shoo Shroom for the 500 bits.
[298:10.11]You make the goose in my heart do a happy honk.
[298:15.57]That's cute.
[298:17.23]That's a very cute thing to say.
[298:19.95]Thank you, Shoo Shroom, for the 500 bits.
[298:21.72]That's a very cute thing to say.
[298:23.98]Adorable.
[298:24.40]Almost as adorable as the game.
[298:25.38]How do you guys like this track?
[298:27.44]Isn't this good?
[298:33.47]It's a pretty good chill track, I think.
[298:36.89]Oh, by the way, I'm also going to have... Lord, I'll make like ten more of these.
[298:45.18]Stay tuned.
[298:47.40]Also, thank you to... I Love Jerma.

[299:09.41]Okay.
[299:11.71]That's great.
[299:14.65]I don't even want to click this image.
[299:18.74]Um...
[299:22.77]How do I delete somebody else's username?
[299:27.37]Why, why, okay, as the broadcaster, right?
[299:29.49]Why can't, if somebody has Jerma in their name, why can't I like just, why can't I just change their name?
[299:35.68]To like, I, what's the one guy's name?
[299:38.92]I, okay, I love ice cream.
[299:40.78]Okay, ice cream.
[299:42.06]I'll make, I'll make that person okay ice cream too.
[299:47.06]He's on a power trip.
[299:54.04]How do I delete somebody else's username and then replace it?
[300:00.02]Why can't I have a society where I just rule completely?
[300:06.33]Nah, I'm kidding around.
[300:07.43]Uh, thank you for the 1500 bits.
[300:09.27]I don't even know how to respond to what you wrote.
[300:12.47]So I'm just gonna say... Thanks for the 1500 bits.
[300:16.59]I appreciate it.
[300:17.25]That's very nice of you.
[300:19.81]Uh, Frilitti, thanks for the five community subs.
[300:23.71]Five subs.
[300:24.63]Thank you.
[300:25.09]John Mert, thanks for the thousand bits.
[300:27.71]They say PogChamp.
[300:30.37]PogChamp.
[300:32.97]That's if you're on a power trip.
[300:34.49]That's power.
[300:38.44]He didn't even link me.
[300:39.48]What is this?
[300:44.84]What do you mean he didn't link me to anything?
[300:47.80]He did.
[300:57.43]It's a black screen.
[300:58.33]It says you fell for it.
[301:03.21]Can you tell that it was a black screen?
[301:07.53]Oh, no.
[301:09.27]You fell for it, fool.
[301:10.41]Thunder cross split attack.
[301:18.16]Oh, so they were lying.
[301:24.53]Thank you to Bingo Bango for the 1,000 bits.
[301:31.30]Thank you so much.
[301:32.74]Then they say Moon to Pregario.
[301:41.30]Is that an emote?
[301:48.56]What is that emote?
[302:02.57]It's a pregnant Mario?
[302:11.20]Wait, there's a pregnant Luigi as well.
[302:16.50]No, there's not.
[302:18.62]Why?
[302:19.42]Why is there a pregnant Mario and a pregnant Luigi?
[302:28.01]That's fucking insane.
[302:34.05]I can't even... I can't even, like, look at it.
[302:37.77]It's freaking me out.
[302:40.04]Why am I saying it out loud?
[302:41.40]I don't know, because it's all I can see.
[302:44.76]You're here, too.
[302:46.46]Are we just going to pretend it doesn't exist?
[302:49.92]I'm here, you're here, and it's every other message in the chat.
[302:56.07]That's... Stop making the... Alright, alright, alright, listen.
[303:00.70]That's fucking, like, that's... I mean, come on.
[303:06.78]I don't know why it's... I don't know what the context is on that, but, like, I'm laughing at it.
[303:12.00]I don't even know what the context is.
[303:13.22]I don't even know what that is.
[303:24.91]Alright.
[303:25.73]Anyways.
[303:26.05]Anyways.
[303:30.48]This guy... This guy fucking sucks at sweeping up popcorn.
[303:36.72]While somebody out there in the back keeps throwing it.
[303:47.89]He's really good at... Oh, he's rolling my eye!
[303:51.62]What the fuck was that?
[303:53.46]Did you see that?
[303:54.44]My eye got sucked in.
[303:59.89]It was like... Holy shit.
[304:03.01]That hurt.
[304:05.37]Wow.
[304:08.45]He's a lizard.
[304:09.17]He's coming out of his lizard skin.
[304:13.34]That was probably loud.
[304:14.06]I'm sorry.
[304:19.44]Did you reverse it?
[304:20.32]I guess I did.
[304:21.02]That fucking hurt.
[304:29.07]Anyways.
[304:30.97]Yeah, I'm good now.
[304:33.03]Uh, we had... Me either.
[304:34.93]I can't wait.
[304:35.27]I am ready.
[304:35.59]I am ready.
[304:55.92]Hey, Springfield, thanks for the 250 bits.
[304:58.60]Hey, Jerma, been a longtime fan.
[304:59.80]I was wondering if there was going to be a follow-up to the story of My Old Bones, the greatest video ever created.
[305:04.82]There will never be a follow-up video to that because the story has been told.
[305:09.95]The story has been told already.
[305:11.37]There's no need to... And that guy, that captain, I don't know the story.
[305:17.85]He's already told it.
[305:21.15]I like how Jerma moves out west to do more projects, but did a project out east.
[305:28.61]The project started in the west.
[305:33.40]By the way.
[305:34.70]Hold on a second here.
[305:36.26]It wasn't the east coast, okay?
[305:38.80]It was eastern time.
[305:40.90]But it was... It wasn't... It wasn't in... It was not east coast.
[305:45.05]It was like middle of the country.
[305:48.81]It was not on the east coast.
[305:52.79]It was eastern time in a central location.
[306:00.66]That would be central time.
[306:01.58]No, that's not true, because in some states, county by county, it changes from central to eastern.
[306:07.80]I don't know why.
[306:12.26]So you did it in England.
[306:14.00]You got it.
[306:14.34]It was the beautiful, great state of Indiana.
[306:27.10]This guy has a lot of tomatoes.
[306:32.96]Why Indiana?
[306:34.30]Well, because it was easy for us to transport the robots.
[306:41.49]Very, very easy.
[306:44.71]There's nothing here.
[306:45.77]There's plenty there.
[306:46.51]What are you talking about?
[306:55.44]Why not do it indoors?
[306:56.44]Why would I do a carnival indoors?
[306:57.84]That would be scary.
[307:05.65]An indoor carnival?
[307:12.78]It would be like this.
[307:17.70]If you come into Indiana from Chicago, it smells like a paper mill.
[307:26.48]I don't... I don't even know what that means.
[307:34.04]Do I like Westworld?
[307:35.75]I love Season 1 of Westworld.
[307:39.17]That's about it.
[307:42.21]The Mall of America is basically an indoor carnival.
[307:44.47]Yeah, but I... Come on.
[307:46.97]I'm talking about like an old Midway.
[307:53.32]Alright, let's...
[307:56.77]Can you guys even see what I'm doing?
[307:58.11]I'm doing like a funny fucking look at anything and nobody can even see it.
[308:00.63]Alright, hey!
[308:02.71]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[308:05.59]Hey!
[308:07.45]Future gamer, thanks for the 250.
[308:08.63]I'm gonna need you to explain this image.
[308:10.47]Explain what image?
[308:12.77]Caught to see cool things at Blizzard HQ.
[308:14.50]Take a look.
[308:15.74]It's me puking into a toilet.
[308:25.16]um do you really need context for something what context do you need here because uh did it did he post that like two or three times I don't remember was there more than one of these there might be like two or three hold on I'll put okay why can I show this one yeah it's not it's fake
[309:03.48]So, Star and I thought it would be this really funny thing.
[309:06.28]You know, I'm not even gonna link it, just in case somebody fucking gets upset.
[309:09.84]Go to that link, if you want to see it.
[309:12.47]Yeah, so, Star and I had this idea where every... And you know how people go to events.
[309:18.49]Hey, I'm going to TwitchCon!
[309:19.55]Hey, I'm going to BlizzCon!
[309:20.73]Oh, see you at PAX!
[309:22.43]And they take pictures of all kinds of stuff.
[309:25.24]Oh, look, it's the guy from Borderlands!
[309:27.24]Whoa!
[309:28.38]Holy shit, it's so cool!
[309:29.37]Let's pan over here!
[309:30.53]What's that?
[309:31.11]Oh my god, is that Thrall?
[309:33.31]Get a photo of it!
[309:34.29]Help me!
[309:35.07]People post shit like that all the time to their feeds.
[309:38.09]And we thought, what if your feed was things that you saw at BlizzCon?
[309:41.75]Wow, hey, look what I saw!
[309:43.26]And it's just me throwing up into the toilet every single time.
[309:52.73]That's, I think, Star has on his phone, probably like, I mean, I don't know about anymore, but I think we did that like four or five times.
[310:02.47]With like, me and I had different clothes on and stuff.
[310:05.64]Like, oh dude, I just checked out, like, holy shit, what, what, like, this was, this is so cool, like at BlizzCon!
[310:10.66]It's just another photo of me, like, sick in the toilet.
[310:18.56]He still has them.
[310:19.48]He shows them every stream.
[310:20.78]Why would he show them every stream?
[310:28.79]But yeah, if I'm remembering, that's what we were doing there.
[310:36.55]You know, the funny thing is I actually like slept through most of that BlizzCon.
[310:41.45]I was on a really backwards schedule.
[310:43.45]I was dealing with like some like, I think I was going through like some medical stuff too.
[310:47.86]And I like, I fucking slept through the first two days.
[310:50.56]I didn't even go to BlizzCon for like the first two days.
[310:56.22]He has a picture of me in the hotel bed.
[310:59.96]Just sleeping in the bed.
[311:01.64]Hey, what did you do at TwitchCon?
[311:06.31]And not even like, oh, did you have a hangover?
[311:10.01]Or, wow, were you actually sick?
[311:12.82]No, not really.
[311:14.42]I mean, I...
[311:18.79]That was such a... I remember that too.
[311:20.23]I remember it being like 1 or 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
[311:23.59]And I was just sleeping.
[311:25.57]And I rolled over and looked at my phone.
[311:26.93]I was like, I don't care.
[311:29.71]I just... I wanted to see the Overwatch thing.
[311:32.39]And that was it.
[311:32.99]I think I rolled out of bed at like 7 o'clock.
[311:43.63]But... Yes.
[311:46.75]Uh...
[311:48.62]I don't know.
[311:49.30]It just kind of happened.
[311:51.02]But yeah, that picture, there's your explanation.
[311:53.22]Hopefully that was exact... My eye was just about to do the thing again.
[311:58.40]Did I turn 34 and got saggy ass eyes?
[312:01.84]What happened?
[312:05.02]I don't like that.
[312:05.60]I don't like... I don't want saggy eyes.
[312:10.62]Hey, oh my god, Taeyon.
[312:12.08]Thanks for the $2.50.
[312:13.66]250 bits.
[312:14.36]Jerma, you are a treasure.
[312:17.54]I'm glad you think so.
[312:21.16]Glad you think so.
[312:23.84]Thank you.
[312:24.78]So are you.
[312:25.16]You're a treasure, too.
[312:26.14]Thank you.
[312:28.22]We also had those 20 community subs from JermaSucks.
[312:33.15]Come on.
[312:36.67]You have given a lot of money, though, JermaSucks.
[312:38.91]How do I make somebody's username all capitals?
[312:43.49]Because I'm not going to change your name.
[312:45.61]It's good the way it is.
[312:48.58]Thank you, though, for your 20 community subs you gave earlier.
[312:51.47]Thank you, Backin, for the 250 bits.
[312:53.85]You always fill my day with happiness, Jerma.
[312:56.01]Even if I'm getting to be really uncertain on life.
[312:59.15]I adored the Carnival stream, by the way.
[313:00.76]Keep going, you.
[313:01.94]Keep doing you.
[313:03.94]Jerma Hart.
[313:07.30]I'm going to keep going.
[313:09.06]As long as I am able to do this.
[313:12.84]I told myself a very, very, very lo- This is, you know, this is real talk.
[313:15.98]I told myself a very, very long time ago.
[313:18.09]This is like probably 20, 30 years ago.
[313:19.97]I was a young, young kid.
[313:22.83]That if I ever made it somehow, doing something that I really wanted to do like this, that I was going to do everything in my physical power
[313:35.27]To try as much... Do the best I could.
[313:38.35]And try as hard as I could.
[313:39.61]And do as many things... Regardless of... If they were good business decisions or not.
[313:45.63]I was going to do the things that I really wanted to do.
[313:50.95]And... I'm here now.
[313:54.37]So it's a... It's a weird feeling.
[314:00.99]But I'm not going to stop.
[314:03.09]So...
[314:07.04]I plan on doing this for as long as I can.
[314:10.50]Play Spore, you got it.
[314:12.54]Let's go, right now.
[314:13.76]Let's play Spore right now.
[314:14.68]What do you think?
[314:15.32]Hold on, it's gotta download it.
[314:18.88]I want... You know what, I'm gonna see if Lordow can make tomatoes that go this way, to hit me in the face.
[314:24.16]So I can react randomly to tomatoes being thrown at me.
[314:26.93]We're not gonna play Spore right now.
[314:27.99]I'm gonna lie about playing Spore in the next username.
[314:33.29]But thank you, backin' for the 250.
[314:34.77]Thank you, Devakitty, for the 250.
[314:36.87]Jerma, you should play Darkwood tomorrow.
[314:38.33]It would be super fun.
[314:39.41]Mokka, yes.
[314:42.38]Um... Wait till October.
[314:46.62]Wait till we get October here.
[314:48.06]How are you doing?
[314:49.52]I'll cut him.
[314:51.27]Once October rolls around, I'll play some scary stuff.
[314:55.91]Like the week or two before Halloween.
[314:58.96]Oh, if only I could do the thing that I wanted.
[315:01.56]I said I wanted to do last year on Halloween, and I'm not going to have time and resources to do it.
[315:10.37]Oh, well.
[315:12.89]Maybe next year.
[315:15.49]Maybe next year.
[315:17.73]But, thank you.
[315:18.83]Yes.
[315:19.79]We'll do Darkwood probably a week or two before Halloween.
[315:24.55]Uh... I'm gonna probably say your name wrong, hopefully I get it right.
[315:28.80]Ulixi... Ulix?
[315:31.70]O-U-L-I-X-E-S.
[315:34.32]Ul... Ulixis.
[315:35.82]Ulixis?
[315:36.62]I'm gonna say Ulixis.
[315:38.20]Thank you for the thousand bits.
[315:39.20]Hey Jerma, someone previously made that statement.
[315:41.48]That you're one of the greatest entertainers of our time.
[315:45.10]And I find myself agreeing with them completely.
[315:48.94]That's... I... That is a huge, huge thing to hear.
[315:52.54]I don't... I am... That's very, very humbling.
[315:56.69]I'm so happy that you have that opinion.
[316:01.41]If you really think that, then there's much more I could probably... I could do.
[316:05.89]I... There's... We're not even started yet.
[316:08.97]You know?
[316:09.43]Like, we're just getting up to, like, the top of the hill.
[316:14.37]It's not even... It hadn't even started yet.
[316:17.61]So...
[316:19.06]Thank you.
[316:20.12]I don't even know what to say.
[316:21.92]If somebody really thinks that.
[316:24.46]Uh, your originality and humility know no bounds and you inspire me to be more like you each and every stream.
[316:29.74]The world is a much better place knowing that you are in it.
[316:32.54]Much love from across the pond.
[316:38.42]If you get anything, if you, if I can inspire you to do something, fuck yeah.
[316:44.29]Like, if you take, take, if you take something from, if you take anything from here, take something from here.
[316:49.94]Know what I'm saying?
[316:52.98]Try to turn, dude, try to turn into something good.
[316:56.97]Make somebody happy, right?
[316:58.27]Do something fun.
[317:01.33]I, um... That's the only thing that I fucking care about.
[317:06.23]It really is.
[317:08.01]Hopefully I've proved that over the years.
[317:10.08]I don't want to just kind of talk bullshit and nonsense.
[317:13.96]Like, all I care about is, all I care about is the community, yeah, like, do do do, thought bubble, like, no I don't, that's a lie, I'm just saying it.
[317:24.00]I hope that over the last, like, four or five years, that, you know, he lied about Spore though, that's true.
[317:34.23]You can hold that against me.
[317:37.30]I ain't perfect though, you know what I mean, like, I ain't fucking perfect.
[317:41.30]I'm not even close.
[317:47.29]Just be real is all I can ask.
[317:48.69]That's all I want to do.
[317:49.85]That's all I can do.
[317:50.75]I can't pretend.
[317:51.97]I can't do it.
[317:53.01]You'll know.
[317:55.13]You know how easy it is to see through somebody when they're just beating you dog shit?
[317:58.41]Like, I can't do it.
[317:59.63]I could never do it.
[318:02.17]I'm not smart enough to convince you otherwise.
[318:06.06]You know, that's... I'm not supposed... I don't want to look at you.
[318:08.42]I'm supposed to be looking down here, right?
[318:09.44]I'm just creeping somebody out.
[318:14.98]He's not pretending.
[318:18.38]No, I'm not going to pretend like I'm somehow the only person.
[318:21.76]I'm the only person in the world that is genuine.
[318:25.04]No, there's tons of people that do this shit that feel the same way.
[318:29.32]You probably watched some of them already.
[318:32.35]There are a lot of people that do think that.
[318:34.51]So this is not a...
[318:38.26]trying to stand on a pedestal or something.
[318:39.86]I'm just, I'm really happy that people think that this is still a good fucking place to hang out and still growing and people still have fun and I'm able and capable to do stuff like I did a few days ago because there are people that watch that care about this channel.
[318:55.93]You know?
[318:56.41]Like, I... Put him on the pedestal, but he's still short.
[319:07.80]Don't make me scream into this, I will.
[319:10.04]I've got a limiter now, though.
[319:15.50]But I don't want to get ranty.
[319:17.48]We have this conversation sometimes.
[319:19.54]You know, once in a while, every couple months.
[319:22.46]And... Just know one thing, okay?
[319:32.45]Sick.
[319:35.05]Sick.
[319:37.35]Alright?
[319:40.39]That's it.
[319:41.59]What's the song's name?
[319:42.79]Um... I think it's just called Jerma Plexus.
[319:49.17]The name of the theater.
[319:53.33]His IQ is too high.
[319:55.96]No, but I don't want to come up as a preachy dick, either.
[320:02.10]Because that's annoying, too.
[320:04.14]You know what I mean?
[320:05.06]Oh, okay.
[320:07.97]Because I know.
[320:08.51]I don't want to sound like that.
[320:09.85]I don't want to sound like I'm preaching.
[320:13.76]I'm just trying.
[320:14.28]I'm trying and I hope they find me.
[320:19.64]And Anonymous just gave five community subs.
[320:23.22]Five community subs from Anonymous.
[320:25.90]Don't know who you are, but thank you.
[320:30.73]If you say Shpi, I will do Twitch Prime.
[320:33.25]Okay, I can see your name right now.
[320:38.26]Let's see it.
[320:47.18]I held up my end of the bargain.
[320:48.34]Right now, that person's going.
[320:55.89]Fuck!
[320:58.27]Got scammed?
[320:58.81]It's alright.
[320:59.29]Scammed me.
[320:59.65]It's alright.
[321:00.07]It's alright.
[321:02.41]He did it!
[321:02.75]Did he do it?
[321:04.29]He did it!
[321:05.67]There it is!
[321:06.15]There it is!
[321:10.95]alright alright not scammed now once a month remind me to do that so you re-up your subscription hey pretender thanks for the 250. I don't have a lot to give but if you're going to keep doing these high production streams I want to contribute what I can keep on being the best entertainer out there
[321:37.76]Thank you, PretendDeer.
[321:38.82]Appreciate it.
[321:39.48]KidThunder, five community subs from KidThunder.
[321:41.88]Thank you, Kid.
[321:44.46]Thank you.
[321:46.70]I'll be taking that one.
[321:49.61]Thanks for making my night with that shpee.
[321:51.11]You got it.
[321:52.97]Absolutely.
[321:55.39]But thank you, PretendDeer.
[321:59.31]Thank you, Flugboy, for the 500 bits.
[322:00.63]Hey, Jeremy, I literally have no words for the Carnival stream.
[322:03.01]I'm incredibly proud of you.
[322:04.74]Keep amazing me every elaborate stream.
[322:08.66]Also, you should totally throw Borderlands 3 on your off-stream games.
[322:13.06]And also was wondering if you were going to stream or play Death Stranding.
[322:17.20]Also, happy birthday.
[322:19.04]Thank you for the birthday wish.
[322:19.89]I appreciate that.
[322:20.71]Thank you.
[322:21.97]I don't know if I'm going to play Death Stranding.
[322:25.41]I'm probably not going to play Borderlands 3.
[322:29.01]I didn't really play Borderlands 2.
[322:31.41]I played Borderlands 1.
[322:33.63]You know what?
[322:34.21]I think there's a video of me playing Borderlands 2 for like 10 minutes with like 3 or 4 people.
[322:39.88]That's buried somewhere on the channel.
[322:42.34]There's a Borderlands 2 Episode 1 Let's Play.
[322:46.84]How many episodes are there?
[322:55.04]There's probably two or three.
[323:00.10]Two.
[323:02.07]No, I'm not really into the whole loot shooter thing anymore.
[323:08.81]I'm looking for something else.
[323:14.15]Borderlands 3 is a mess right now.
[323:15.85]I would not know.
[323:17.41]I've not been around.
[323:22.60]But, yeah.
[323:25.26]Probably not going to play the Death Stranding on stream.
[323:31.39]I don't think I would do that.
[323:33.72]That's probably something that I would want to do just on my own.
[323:36.78]And just kind of enjoy it.
[323:38.68]Kind of like what I'm doing with God of War.
[323:40.30]I know.
[323:40.64]I know people are going to be very mad about this.
[323:42.42]I'm currently... Well, not currently, but I was currently playing through God of War off-stream.
[323:50.60]It's been great.
[323:52.86]I know.
[323:53.94]I know.
[323:54.44]And there's been a lot of times where I've gone, you know, I really wish the stream was on right now because that was awesome.
[324:01.53]Let us watch.
[324:03.35]Mmm...
[324:06.26]No, no, because me and Kim, I'm playing it for Kim.
[324:11.09]Kim will come up and go, hey, can you play God of War?
[324:14.59]And it's like, yeah, sure, I'll play God of War.
[324:19.31]It's kind of like a little thing that we have right now.
[324:24.62]She's currently enjoying her personal playthrough of God of War.
[324:30.94]Yeah, it's fun.
[324:33.53]We're getting up here to the end.
[324:35.53]We got probably another 5-10 minutes left.
[324:40.58]Still a lot of people here, too.
[324:44.58]Those of you that are new, maybe you're kind of curious of what is going on here, but I probably should have said this in the very beginning of this kind of wind-down.
[324:54.57]At the end of 95% of all streams...
[324:59.48]I don't read bits or subs on stream.
[325:02.99]So at the very end of a stream, we'll just kind of hang out and I'll go over what's come through and respond to messages and stuff like that.
[325:11.39]And then we run subcredits at the end.
[325:14.37]So that's probably if you were curious as to why you didn't see any notifications or you didn't see I wasn't talking to or reacting to any bit messages is because I do not do that.
[325:26.86]I also have a Twitter too.
[325:27.72]Somebody just linked it.
[325:29.95]Is my name Brad?
[325:30.89]No.
[325:31.15]My name is... My name is Jerry Elbertson.
[325:34.94]Thank you.
[325:36.44]But... We were down here... At... Where were we?
[325:45.24]Yes, that was Flugboy, uh, that gave the happy birthday 500 bits, and they talked about the carnival stream.
[325:50.90]I really appreciate it.
[325:51.76]Thank you.
[325:52.92]DubskiDude, thanks for the 500 bits.
[325:55.73]Five dollars from DubskiDude.
[325:56.77]Hey, Jerma.
[325:58.03]I heard you were strapped for cash, so here's five whole dollars to pay for the carnival stream.
[326:03.01]That should cover most of the expenses.
[326:04.96]No need to thank me.
[326:05.66]But for real, though, I can't believe you pulled it off.
[326:09.18]I was very impressed with the sheer creativity of it.
[326:11.78]And I'm not kidding when I say you're a visionary.
[326:14.39]It's great to be able to watch you progress into bigger and better skits.
[326:17.99]But the real question is, jermaTV show when?
[326:24.14]You're watching it right now.
[326:26.42]You are currently watching it right now.
[326:32.63]You're on the channel.
[326:34.33]This is the channel you're on.
[326:36.57]It's jermaTV.
[326:38.17]Jerma985 TV.
[326:43.29]TV's... Yeah, so much more goes into TV.
[326:48.85]I would rather just make a few phone calls and say, here's an idea that I want to do.
[326:55.59]Let's make it happen.
[326:57.07]For my channel, not for anybody else's.
[327:00.53]I'd rather do that than have like a TV show, which this is so much more goes into that.
[327:06.69]But I'm happy that you liked it.
[327:09.07]I'm glad that you enjoyed it.
[327:10.57]I'm glad that people thought it was fun.
[327:11.85]And I'm glad you got to at least win some of the games because I really was concerned that you weren't going to do any of them.
[327:19.08]But you did almost all of them.
[327:22.58]I don't think there was... Well, actually, that kind of knocked the clowns down.
[327:27.38]Uh, you only got two or three of those, but... I guess that- you got the- the pain, so that was enough for a- a- a painful hurt-myself dab, so that's alright.
[327:37.40]You didn't do the first one.
[327:38.22]That's right, the bottle- no, did you- no, you didn't do the bottles.
[327:42.18]Ring toss, no, you didn't do ring toss, right?
[327:45.26]Oh, shit.
[327:46.44]You guys didn't do ring toss.
[327:49.54]Oh, well.
[327:51.71]We're sorry.
[327:56.86]The cans?
[327:58.32]Yeah, you guys... You guys tried.
[328:01.20]You kind of disqualified yourselves, though.
[328:03.18]It's okay.
[328:04.96]Hey!
[328:06.39]Mostly lost.
[328:06.97]Thanks for the $2.50.
[328:07.85]Happy belated birthday... Happy belated birthday, Jumbo.
[328:12.37]All the clips earlier reminded me of this classic, Jermabobit.
[328:14.77]Let's see.
[328:24.06]I can drain the beer?
[328:42.00]That was a classic moment.
[328:47.22]The cat puking.
[328:48.18]I was laughing downstairs, taking a piss.
[328:51.52]That was so funny.
[328:54.18]Some of the shit that you guys can come up with... You guys talk about how funny I am.
[329:00.04]That's what it sounds like when my cat is puking.
[329:04.35]Why is your cat puking too?
[329:05.93]Like, when did it happen?
[329:08.91]I imagine your cat just started puking, and you're sitting there going, oh shit, no, no, and then that happens on screen.
[329:22.82]Hairballs, yeah, I know.
[329:26.56]That's not what I was going for, but that's funny regardless.
[329:29.26]Thank you, MostlyLost, for the clip.
[329:31.62]Hey, GoopSnatch, thanks for the 1500 bits.
[329:34.44]I appreciate your streams, dude.
[329:37.17]Recently, I've been going through financial and emotional stress, and your carnival stream was the ice cream on top of the cake.
[329:44.39]I've been watching for a long time and wanted to give back to my favorite streamer.
[329:47.41]Don't worry!
[329:48.11]This didn't harm my wallet too much.
[329:54.95]That's good to know.
[329:57.49]Because if you're going through any financial problems, I really... Do not donate.
[330:02.57]Do not give money to me.
[330:04.97]Take care of yourself.
[330:07.19]But hopefully whatever stress you're going through as well is solved.
[330:12.35]Thank you so much for the 1500 bits.
[330:16.43]Much love to you.
[330:18.53]You don't have to give back.
[330:20.38]I know a lot of you say that, but you don't have to.
[330:28.02]It's not necessary.
[330:29.52]But thank you regardless.
[330:34.12]Even still, when you see messages come in, you see money come in, I'm just, I'm floored.
[330:41.54]I can't wait to do the next one.
[330:48.73]That's what's going to happen with all the money that comes in.
[330:55.11]It's going right to the next one.
[331:00.00]So thank you.
[331:02.38]Mr. Comcast, haven't heard from you in a while.
[331:06.18]Mr. Comcast, 300 bits from Mr. Comcast.
[331:08.70]Hey, Jerma John Comcast here.
[331:10.34]Wow, interesting.
[331:11.58]Just letting you know that I went to your carnival.
[331:13.82]You went to... You went to... You were at the carnival.
[331:16.45]You went to the carnival.
[331:17.79]I want to say hi, but I also didn't want to interrupt you as you peed into the dunk tank.
[331:22.39]I also found it quite disturbing when you demanded that the Andy Mark crew members empty their wallets and put their money into the machine so that you could win it all.
[331:30.87]I was going to leave, but not before I saw you DDT the Wailord plushie into the frog leap table and get a ticket for illegally parking.
[331:43.89]Thank you, uh, thank you Mr. Comcast for the 300 bits.
[331:46.91]Appreciate it.
[331:49.29]Also, thank you to Mostly Lost again!
[331:52.53]250!
[331:53.09]They say, also, Pigeon says you missed their bits from earlier.
[331:56.37]I am going to go back at the very end here.
[332:00.27]So, I'm gonna go back and catch the few that fell through the cracks at the end.
[332:05.76]Or at the beginning, actually, so.
[332:07.68]We'll do them.
[332:08.12]We'll see them.
[332:09.26]We're almost to the end here, so.
[332:11.30]It's the Franco.
[332:13.87]The Franco.
[332:16.12]1 000 bits from the franco hey Jerma me and my dad watched the carnival stream together and we loved it it was my dad's first time seeing anything from you so it was cool to see he enjoyed it now here's the interesting part halfway through the stream he turned to me and asked hey do you remember that guy from the spider-man movie
[332:40.34]The guy that flies around on the thing, he looks like him.
[332:45.39]I couldn't believe it.
[332:47.11]Anyway, thank you so much for these streams.
[332:48.63]Your stuff has been making me laugh for years.
[332:51.31]Thank you.
[332:51.77]It's the Franco.
[332:54.35]Hey, you know, he looks like that guy that flew around on the, uh... Wait.
[333:00.94]He may have been talking about Spider-Man.
[333:03.85]Hold on.
[333:04.91]Remember that guy from Spider-Man?
[333:07.21]The guy that flies around in New York City?
[333:10.05]Flying around Spider-Man?
[333:11.57]He looks like him!
[333:13.46]Alright.
[333:23.54]Nice.
[333:25.16]I'm really glad it's not that guy with the scary mask on that flies around and
[333:32.56]What's his name?
[333:33.12]I'm glad it's not the guy that... Not that one.
[333:36.21]Not the green one, right?
[333:37.57]Yeah.
[333:46.20]Not that one.
[333:49.78]Not that one.
[333:52.32]Hey, thank you though, thank you, hey, thank you.
[333:56.08]Thank you Apple Shift for the $2.50.
[333:57.40]250 bits, hey man, I was wondering this other day, have you ever been noticed in public before?
[334:03.66]Also, the carnival stream was absolutely incredible, and we as a community could not be more proud of it.
[334:08.53]Thank you.
[334:09.81]Uh, yes.
[334:10.79]It's only happened like two or three times.
[334:14.09]It's happened, I think, three times total.
[334:22.07]In places that I wouldn't think.
[334:24.14]I got recognized in a mall before.
[334:27.30]Walking around a mall.
[334:29.58]It was just... And you know.
[334:33.68]You know.
[334:34.64]Right?
[334:35.38]You're walking around.
[334:37.06]You walk by somebody.
[334:37.86]You make the kind of random eye contact for a second.
[334:40.56]And it's just... I know who you are.
[334:45.30]Do I know who you are?
[334:46.32]I think I know who you are.
[334:48.44]Hey, it's you.
[334:49.98]And I'm like, alright.
[334:52.95]Holy shit, it's Willem Dafoe!
[334:55.86]And then I go, no, I get... I get that a lot.
[334:58.86]And then I keep walking, yeah.
[335:04.09]But, yeah, it's happened a few times.
[335:06.64]Doesn't happen that often.
[335:07.96]Maybe like once a year.
[335:09.12]Once every couple years, something like that'll happen.
[335:11.70]At a convention though, something like TwitchCon or PAX or BlizzCon, it's happened maybe a dozen times or so on the show floor.
[335:19.86]People just kind of walk by you and they go, hey!
[335:22.51]And I go, hey!
[335:23.23]And it happens there.
[335:26.75]And that's fun.
[335:28.69]A dozen, yeah, it happened a dozen times.
[335:32.03]No, I very much enjoy it, so if you do see me at TwitchCon, pull me aside and say hello.
[335:37.67]Uh, Saren, thank you SarenFP for the $2.50, 250 bits.
[335:41.85]Yo, Jerma, love the carnival stream.
[335:43.09]To me, it felt more like a love letter to your audience rather than your magnum opus.
[335:48.20]Loving the streams more and more, keep it up.
[335:54.04]I mean, I tried to throw as many random little references in there as I could.
[335:58.32]Like the cash machine and Wailord and Pokémon stuff.
[336:03.67]Other little things too, like the clown car and stuff that I've been saying I wanted to do for a long time.
[336:10.19]So, yeah.
[336:13.37]It was a lot of fun.
[336:16.20]But... See you in a few months.
[336:21.04]This is gonna be a regular thing.
[336:26.02]How much was the clown car?
[336:28.18]That clown car was very, very inexpensive.
[336:32.96]It just needed a little bit of spray paint.
[336:36.40]That's all.
[336:41.74]It was not $400.
[336:48.22]But I don't want to give you any... Come on, let the magic speak for itself.
[336:53.42]I don't want to ruin any magic.
[336:59.22]That was my actual car, yes.
[337:03.60]But thank you to, uh... Thank you to SerenFP.
[337:09.40]So now, we are going to go like this.
[337:14.82]Let's settle it down a little bit.
[337:17.22]We have a little bit more to do.
[337:21.33]Theater is emptying out.
[337:25.85]Was it loud?
[337:26.71]My ears.
[337:27.01]What do you mean, ow?
[337:30.39]Ouch.
[337:30.73]What happened?
[337:34.06]What was loud?
[337:35.00]What happened?
[337:38.72]Did I bump you guys?
[337:45.19]Wait, the transition is loud?
[337:52.29]Oh.
[337:53.27]Okay.
[337:54.39]I'm stupid.
[337:59.49]Stop hitting me.
[338:07.01]But... Let's keep going.
[338:10.77]Jake... Thank you, Jake Games!
[338:15.10]Stumbled across Randomly Jermania 2014 in early 2015.
[338:19.88]Seeing you start streaming and then take your streams to a whole other level has been an incredible experience.
[338:26.61]I...
[338:29.88]Every video that I made and every stream that I do, I try to have it be as fun as the last one in my head internally.
[338:38.74]Now, I know it's impossible, but I try.
[338:45.18]Once you start bringing in production and money and huge ideas, you can.
[338:49.82]But I still like to try.
[338:54.54]Hey, Effectator!
[338:56.72]Thank you, Effectator, for the 500...
[339:00.60]bits thank you uh just want to remind you however grateful I am that you and mac gave me a chance thanks to this editing job my life is really on track jeff just moved in with my partner this week and I got my first prescription to start transitioning and having sufficient work made it all possible thank you Jerma thank you mac and thank you chat thank you so much effectator seriously
[339:36.89]Good luck on that journey.
[339:40.47]Because that's a new book.
[339:41.65]That's a new page to turn.
[339:43.72]I wish you the best.
[339:46.06]You've been incredibly talented.
[339:57.72]Coming in in the clutch so many times.
[340:01.94]I really appreciate what you do.
[340:08.07]Thank you.
[340:15.68]Is the game over?
[340:16.66]Yeah.
[340:17.20]Oh, shit.
[340:19.20]Hold on.
[340:29.25]It's still on the goose game, right?
[340:31.83]Uh-oh.
[340:37.35]Well, I guess, no, that's okay.
[340:38.87]I mean, technically it's okay.
[340:44.50]Because, I mean, what is the, I, this is just the end, kind of the end.
[340:47.20]I need to, no, I gotta, like, change that.
[340:49.36]I can't just be sitting in the goose.
[340:52.14]Let's just put it at, uh, just chatting is fine.
[341:02.59]Alright, and, oh, I see this is barking at people.
[341:04.55]That's not accurate either.
[341:09.62]But we are going to move to a screen that you are very used to.
[341:16.96]This one.
[341:26.04]I'm going to move back to Boston.
[341:28.18]No.
[341:32.86]Oh no, it's too loud.
[341:34.34]I'll fix it.
[341:41.09]Thank you, everybody, for joining me on this return stream.
[341:44.91]We're going to do one more tomorrow.
[341:46.19]Tomorrow's stream is not going to be that long.
[341:49.65]Sorry that it's been sporadic, but it's just been insanely busy the last couple weeks.
[341:55.26]Try to do something fun tomorrow.
[342:00.24]But we're not quite done.
[342:01.22]We still have a little bit more to do.
[342:05.28]Thank you, Mr. Picklesworth, for the thousand bits.
[342:07.51]Jeremy, I just want to thank you for being one of the most genuine people on the internet.
[342:11.33]You deserve all this fucking support.
[342:12.95]You put so much time and effort into these huge projects.
[342:14.99]You spend literally thousands of dollars just to entertain people.
[342:18.25]You're my favorite person of all time.
[342:20.15]Thanks for inspiring me and so many other people.
[342:22.39]Keep up the great work, Boomer.
[342:24.35]Though that time you hit me with your car and drove away wasn't very cool.
[342:28.23]What?
[342:32.38]That was a small tonal shift.
[342:35.20]Thank you for the thousand bits.
[342:38.92]I appreciate it.
[342:42.06]Hey, Apple Shift, $2.50.
[342:43.42]One more thing.
[342:44.58]I bought myself an Andy Mark goat yesterday.
[342:46.69]What should I name it?
[342:48.93]Gary, of course.
[342:53.05]Get some insurance money.
[342:59.70]Yeah, those are still available.
[343:02.32]They still are there.
[343:03.30]I don't know how many they're going to have.
[343:06.08]But that was just kind of randomly.
[343:07.14]They just were like, hey, we're going to put them up.
[343:09.92]And yeah, if you want one, grab one.
[343:14.84]But thank you, Appleship.
[343:15.70]Thank you, Calusia, for the $3.
[343:18.44]Hi, Jerma.
[343:18.94]I probably sound like a broken record at this point.
[343:21.48]But I really want to say I love the Carnival stream.
[343:23.02]It was amazing to see everything come together.
[343:25.16]Really admire your dedication and creativity for these kinds of things.
[343:28.46]Looking forward for more things to come, and I can't wait to see you at TwitchCon.
[343:32.01]Alright, hell yeah.
[343:34.77]See you at TwitchCon.
[343:37.34]I don't have any official meet-and-greets, by the way, so I'm gonna do the thing that I always do.
[343:41.44]And that's... I'm gonna pull up a table or something.
[343:44.04]In the corner.
[343:45.34]Like, where... And... Wherever I can find a place to do it.
[343:48.76]And I'm just gonna, like... Eat a couple cookies and... Hang out there.
[343:57.41]Nightbot isn't always accurate.
[343:59.31]Not really.
[344:02.31]He's gonna go sit in... Next to the... Why would I sit next to the bathroom?
[344:07.52]Oh, wait, I have done that.
[344:10.09]I think I did that, like, two or three years ago at PAX East.
[344:13.25]Yeah.
[344:16.25]Yeah, that was just right in front of, like, the bathrooms.
[344:18.99]Oh, shit, you're right.
[344:21.19]Well, I don't know.
[344:23.28]I have no idea where... I don't know.
[344:25.12]Or maybe not.
[344:25.66]Maybe I'll just... Maybe it'll be, like, a Where's Waldo scenario.
[344:27.80]Maybe you're gonna find me.
[344:30.44]Maybe I'll, like, tweet, like, a hint out or something of, like, where I am.
[344:39.84]But, yeah, if you're going to SwitchCon, track me down.
[344:45.09]I'll be there on Saturday.
[344:46.91]I'll be there on Saturday morning.
[344:53.85]That's kind of where I will be.
[344:55.30]It's Saturday morning into early Saturday afternoon is where you'll be able to find me.
[345:06.94]But thank you, Calusia.
[345:11.12]Maybe I'll see you there.
[345:14.19]Hallulu, thanks for the 250.
[345:15.47]Hey, Jerma, happy birthday.
[345:16.77]It's been amazing seeing you continue to push your creativity and make innovative experiences.
[345:20.81]I traveled and got to watch the carnival stream with the person who first introduced me to you years ago through Castle Griffinsteed.
[345:28.41]That video was so much fun to make.
[345:30.35]It's funny, I can always look back at videos or streams that I could just go, oh, that was so much fun to make.
[345:35.07]And it always turns out to be some of my favorite things I've ever done.
[345:59.26]Thank you.
[346:01.40]I'm gonna continue to try.
[346:03.40]C4G, thanks for the 250.
[346:05.30]They say pride.
[346:06.74]250 pride bisexual.
[346:10.35]Thank you so much.
[346:12.31]Thanks for the 250.
[346:12.93]The end of the stream is so wholesome.
[346:21.95]I mean, I'm just kinda... I'm just kinda hanging out.
[346:23.95]You know what I'm saying?
[346:27.77]Just...
[346:30.08]That's what I was saying, for those of you that were maybe new to the stream, we just kind of just wind down here.
[346:43.04]Just chilling.
[346:44.22]Just hanging out.
[346:47.06]The stream technically ended like an hour ago.
[346:51.73]But this is the second post-stream that I do every single stream.
[346:57.59]If that makes any sense.
[346:58.41]I think it does.
[347:04.03]Feels like dad is reading me a bedtime story.
[347:07.75]Have a great night.
[347:13.17]But thank you to Birth Yogurt for the 500 bits.
[347:16.53]Oh, Jerma, the old ones smile upon the old ones.
[347:21.23]They're like Cthulhu?
[347:28.56]Cthulhu.
[347:34.96]What do you mean, old ones?
[347:36.74]That's freaking me out.
[347:42.09]Don't say it.
[347:42.71]What do you mean, don't say it?
[347:44.01]It's not Beetlejuice.
[347:47.93]Thank you, Devakitty, for the $2.50.
[347:49.08]Hey, Jerm, I think you lost my early bits, so I'll just send you some more.
[347:52.73]Nevertheless, I love the carnival stream, even the weird kids hospital clowns you hired.
[347:58.50]Thank you for always being a fun streamer and a good guy.
[348:01.10]You've helped me through a lot of depression and dysphoria, so thank you for carrying me this far.
[348:05.84]Because I'm actually trying, I'm actually having my legal gender and name change tomorrow.
[348:13.49]So here's to my new real name, Luna.
[348:17.07]Transgender pride.
[348:22.47]I've said this a few times before, and I want to just reiterate it again.
[348:28.62]Whoever the best you is, that's who you should be, and that's who you are.
[348:47.59]So, thank you.
[348:50.70]for the 250.
[348:51.16]I wish you luck.
[349:05.11]Thank you so much, Defakitty.
[349:14.65]Thank you to Gnarly for the 250 as well.
[349:18.33]So when is the next Hearthstone stream?
[349:19.96]Never.
[349:20.32]Never.
[349:22.28]That's not a joke question.
[349:23.54]I thought it was.
[349:24.26]Alright, and I'll answer that for real now.
[349:26.82]Okay.
[349:27.60]When's the next Hearthstone stream?
[349:28.89]That's not a joke question.
[349:32.87]I'm one of those sick fucks who actually liked that stream and the new solo content came out.
[349:41.37]Well, doesn't that kind of answer the question?
[349:49.33]I'm one of those sick fucks who liked that stream.
[349:56.98]Alright, so I'm so gnarly.
[349:59.22]I may as well just stream it to you.
[350:02.26]Do they have passwords on Twitch?
[350:04.52]Password controlled streams?
[350:06.32]I'll just give you the password and whatever.
[350:09.82]At that point, it's like 87% of every human that sat here and watched that stream begged me not to do that ever again.
[350:19.43]You're gonna give him a private Snapchat.
[350:22.97]Let him in!
[350:24.43]No!
[350:27.09]I can't.
[350:29.70]Please don't.
[350:30.44]See?
[350:30.66]That's only one person that wants that.
[350:35.58]A true one-guy stream.
[350:37.98]Maybe I'll do it one day.
[350:39.44]That's funny to me for some reason.
[350:40.94]I don't know why.
[350:41.54]Just do a private stream to one person.
[350:48.58]It should be a contest.
[350:50.01]That would be a really, really funny contest.
[350:54.03]Set up some type of competition or contest or something, and that person wins a private full livestream.
[351:04.99]That would be so awkward.
[351:06.29]Yeah, I mean, it kind of would.
[351:10.57]But it's making me laugh right now, so I think it's something I want to explore.
[351:16.91]I don't think I could handle that.
[351:18.77]What if they don't show up?
[351:22.19]You know, I... Alright, I'm gonna tell you this because there's no way it's gonna happen ever.
[351:28.41]That's not true though.
[351:31.73]I have to hold on to so many ideas that if I ever use them, I can't let them out.
[351:42.56]But when am I gonna have time to do this though?
[351:44.68]That's impossible.
[351:49.82]I can't.
[351:50.56]No, I can't.
[351:51.12]Just in case, years down the road, this is something that I do.
[351:55.00]I can't.
[352:00.51]You know, I think there's one person that knows about this.
[352:04.87]Maybe, like, two.
[352:07.29]Is Lucratius here?
[352:10.35]Is Luke here?
[352:11.15]Lucratius?
[352:13.37]Definitely not.
[352:14.21]EU.
[352:14.85]I think Lucratius is the only person that knows about this idea.
[352:18.33]And they have been sworn to secrecy.
[352:26.11]It's pretty good, though.
[352:27.47]I'm not gonna lie.
[352:28.31]It's pretty good.
[352:32.46]It's something I've... No, it's nothing I've ever talked of so far.
[352:38.18]No, it's nothing that you've ever heard of before.
[352:40.31]I've never talked about it.
[352:42.79]But we can move on.
[352:44.27]We gotta end the stream here.
[352:45.63]I didn't think I was gonna go for seven hours, but I haven't been... I haven't been around for like a week, so... I'm cool to hang out and chill for a little bit, so it's fine.
[352:55.27]He just said, you can tell us.
[352:56.69]What?
[353:01.74]No, no, it's not even... It's not... It's not gonna happen.
[353:07.34]But... There's no way he'll ever get out of me.
[353:11.88]Or Lucretius, whatever it is.
[353:20.30]Three hours of game, four hours of chill.
[353:23.69]Yeah, sometimes it's like that, though.
[353:28.25]I'm okay with that sometimes.
[353:33.11]But, Snooze and Coffin, thanks for the $2.50.
[353:34.67]Hi, Jerma, the Carnival stream was exceptional.
[353:39.10]I cannot wait to see what else you have in store for us in the future.
[353:41.28]You're the greatest.
[353:42.14]Thank you, really.
[353:43.62]And now to something else.
[353:45.52]I'm on vacation in Dallas and currently got hit by a car on Sunday.
[353:50.18]That's not good.
[353:52.13]I was on one of those electrical scooters and a car capped me from behind.
[353:55.75]Well, the mirror did.
[353:58.52]Holy shit.
[354:01.62]I got away with a big bruise and some scrapes, so I got pretty surreal, though.
[354:05.94]You ever had any big accidents or injuries?
[354:09.08]I've never been... I've never been hit by a car like that before.
[354:12.21]That sounds horrifying.
[354:13.81]Hopefully, you're alright.
[354:18.87]Big bruise and some scrapes, thankfully.
[354:23.15]But I've had car accidents before.
[354:29.10]I don't know if I ever told you this one time.
[354:30.48]One time I got the worst car accident I was ever in in my whole life.
[354:36.04]I was at a red light.
[354:38.98]Just sitting at a red light.
[354:42.15]And somebody drove into the back of my car going 40 or 50 miles per hour.
[354:47.39]And it was horrible.
[354:49.63]Horrible.
[354:51.47]they just weren't paying attention I was sitting at a stoplight for probably 10 seconds and this person I don't know what they were doing I don't know what happened but holy shit they I thought my car exploded I'm just sitting there at the light and then boom I thought I was like the car I was a car had to explode it it had to have right how else would that have happened
[355:18.29]That was the scariest thing.
[355:19.41]That was probably top five scariest things in my entire life.
[355:30.10]That was... and my car was totaled.
[355:32.28]That was it.
[355:39.52]What's top... what's number one?
[355:41.30]I don't know.
[355:44.16]I'm just saying.
[355:46.29]That's up there somewhere.
[355:48.25]I don't know.
[355:50.85]What could possibly be above that?
[355:56.29]Let me think.
[355:59.09]What could possibly be above that?
[356:00.61]I don't know.
[356:01.43]That's why I said it was somewhere in the top five.
[356:04.24]It could be number one.
[356:11.28]No, there's other dangerous, awful shit.
[356:15.48]I'm trying to think of my whole life
[356:22.02]I don't know.
[356:22.60]It's up there somewhere.
[356:23.70]I know.
[356:24.35]I know there's other stuff that's happened that I could put up there.
[356:33.07]No, no, no.
[356:34.01]There's more.
[356:35.59]But, no, that's probably number one.
[356:37.08]Now that I'm really sitting here thinking about it.
[356:43.00]I just remember... I don't... When something like that happens to you...
[356:48.86]I can remember every second of that experience that's how crazy our brains are I can't tell you what I had for dinner two days ago but I remember every second of that car accident
[357:15.63]But man, yeah, I... I don't want to go into, like, obviously grisly details.
[357:21.36]But that was... That screwed me up for a little while.
[357:24.28]It was really, really fucked up.
[357:29.18]But I was alright.
[357:31.23]I was okay.
[357:32.19]The way that the car hit me, the guy flipped over...
[357:36.43]So he actually flipped over the right side of the car.
[357:39.80]And I think they were in like an SUV.
[357:42.00]So that's horrible because I was in like a little tiny little... I was in like a Chevy or something.
[357:46.24]I'm trying to remember what the car was.
[357:49.81]Yeah.
[357:50.39]No, it was ridiculous.
[357:51.85]And it was on one of the busiest roads too.
[357:55.73]One of the busiest just actual roads.
[357:59.52]It was fucking crazy.
[358:02.54]And I remember just getting out of the car and looking at this, what was left of my vehicle.
[358:08.35]The whole back was crushed in.
[358:10.79]And the whole right side passenger was all messed up too.
[358:13.95]And all I could think of over and over again was going, Thank God there was nobody in my car.
[358:20.87]Thank God I wasn't driving anybody anywhere.
[358:23.45]Thank God I wasn't with any friends or anything.
[358:25.85]I was just alone.
[358:28.21]So, thank God.
[358:36.15]You see, people need to understand the power of a fucking car.
[358:39.66]Yeah, and cars are dangerous, man.
[358:45.52]People, you gotta be careful.
[358:46.56]You see people flying around, driving like assholes.
[358:49.38]Like, you gotta be fucking careful, man.
[358:54.99]Seeing people going 10, 20 miles per hour over the speed limit and shit, it's like, you gotta fucking relax.
[359:00.45]Like, what are you doing?
[359:08.76]See people going, just whizzing by, going like 50 in a 30.
[359:12.62]It's just like, what are you thinking?
[359:19.01]Vegas has some bad drop.
[359:20.17]Nah, no, they do.
[359:23.27]People gotta just relax a little bit.
[359:25.51]You don't gotta... You don't gotta go that fast.
[359:36.48]That's why I don't drive anymore.
[359:37.66]I walk or take public transport if I have to.
[359:42.74]Yeah, I could... Trust me, I get it.
[359:50.56]He's got to be more careful.
[359:53.77]I don't know why.
[359:54.27]Some people just think they're invincible in that thing.
[359:58.17]You're not.
[360:00.57]Let me make that really clear.
[360:02.43]You aren't.
[360:06.35]Yeah, Kim is saying it's worse than Boston.
[360:08.21]Yeah.
[360:11.31]We've been on the highway before, just driving, and Kim and I will just be driving, and all of a sudden, you'll just see somebody just just going.
[360:21.30]And there are other cars on the road, too.
[360:23.44]You've got like two, three, four, five other cars in the lanes on the highway, and they just changing lanes back and forth, back and forth, left, right, right, right, left, right.
[360:30.82]It's just, dude, what are you doing?
[360:33.30]What are you thinking?
[360:36.14]there's no reason to go that fast look we're all going to Baskin Robbins they're still gonna be open don't what are you doing people just drive so fucking fast I don't understand it they close at 8 on Sunday
[361:08.13]You say, yeah, and the worst part about it, then this is real talk right here.
[361:13.98]You know what really, really irritates me in a car?
[361:17.36]So if you're driving and you're on a road, let's say the road is 40 miles per hour, okay?
[361:22.30]And you know, you're going 40.
[361:23.34]You're going, you know, I'm going 38, 40, 41, 42, 40, going 40, 39, right?
[361:25.58]Okay, alright, okay, settle down, right?
[361:27.22]Cool.
[361:35.53]Once you have somebody that passes you, that's going like 60 in that 40, and then you go up to the light that is less than a mile ahead of where you are, and that person you look over to your left, and they're at the same light as you.
[361:54.82]It's like, you got real far, didn't you?
[362:01.31]It's like, you didn't gain any time.
[362:05.22]Haven't you read The Tortoise and the Hare?
[362:07.88]They wrote that fucking book like 75 years ago and it still rings true.
[362:15.45]You're not going to win a race.
[362:17.57]We're just going to the... You're not making time.
[362:20.51]He's doing splits.
[362:34.23]That always just, that just grinds me.
[362:36.85]I get so irritated.
[362:37.99]I'm just like, come on.
[362:39.13]Because think of like the danger that you're putting your fellow drivers in and even yourself.
[362:47.71]For you to look over and see the guy that you passed at the red light should be like an internal scenario where you go, okay, I'm kind of fucking up here.
[362:55.94]I kind of probably should think about what I'm doing.
[363:07.42]People are stupid.
[363:11.63]Yeah, but I'm just venting at this point.
[363:14.49]I'm just venting about drivers.
[363:19.45]Defensive driving is mandatory?
[363:22.05]Yeah.
[363:25.20]It's a temporary lack of empathy or consideration.
[363:31.70]I mean, even... I just don't want to get in a car accident.
[363:35.16]I don't want to get in a car accident.
[363:37.83]If I go 20 miles per hour over the speed limit, I am exponentially increasing the chances that I'm going to get into a car accident by tenfold.
[363:49.04]Why do I want that?
[363:57.99]Should it be harder to get a driver's license?
[364:02.27]I don't know if it should be harder to get a driver's license or if we should...
[364:09.63]I don't know what the answer is.
[364:11.41]I think people just like systematically need to get like taught fucking manners.
[364:17.53]I don't know.
[364:18.21]Like, that's kind of what it is.
[364:32.26]Learn manners.
[364:34.20]Well, because you don't cut the person off.
[364:37.46]Unless you, you know, unless you're just kind of being a dick.
[364:42.73]I can look.
[364:43.65]If somebody, if the speed limit is like 30 miles per hour, and somebody's going like 20, like 25, it's like, okay, you're going slow here.
[364:51.15]You're going really slow.
[364:53.23]If there's a passing lane, then you're okay, whatever.
[364:56.64]But if somebody like me, I go the speed limit.
[365:00.14]I do.
[365:00.62]I go, I go like within 5 miles per hour of the speed limit.
[365:05.89]Whether that's, okay, it's a 30, I'm going like 30, like, between like 28 and like 32, right?
[365:15.27]I try to stay within about 5 miles per hour of the speed limit.
[365:21.07]Plus or minus 5, yeah.
[365:25.19]Once you start to get over about 5 miles per hour of the speed limit, you really want to slow down.
[365:31.68]I'd say at like 3 or 4 miles per hour over.
[365:34.04]Is when I start to go, okay, I'm gonna pull it back a little.
[365:42.52]Miles per hour, yeah, we are talking American in here.
[365:51.23]32, slow down there!
[365:52.69]You're crazy!
[366:00.26]32.
[366:00.44]You know, when it's a 35, I like to go my age, 34.
[366:11.99]But there are smart ways to drive the speed limit.
[366:18.09]If you're gonna go more than 20 plus miles per hour for the speed limit, you are just putting everybody in danger, and it's just not, that's not cool.
[366:29.93]That's a real MonkaS.
[366:31.99]Like, don't do that.
[366:34.43]That's just fucking reckless, and people do it all the time.
[366:38.99]But, I consider and talk about how people driving around like assholes is annoying for the next two hours.
[366:47.90]We are getting close to the end here.
[366:51.36]Don't even know how we got there, but we did.
[366:54.02]Oh, right, Snoozencopter was talking about how they just got hit by a car.
[367:00.21]I'm glad you're okay.
[367:02.75]But, yeah, we talked about kind of accidents and stuff, so... Thanks for the 250.
[367:07.50]Appreciate it.
[367:10.96]Hey, TheFaxMachine, thanks for the five community subs and KidThunder, five community subs.

[367:42.50]Thanks for the five bucks.
[367:44.54]Go Dot, thanks for the five dollars.
[367:46.63]Hey Jerma, I know you're busy, but do you think I could ask you a few questions about yourself?
[367:50.27]This is for a school project where we interview our heroes and then write about them.
[367:54.87]Anyways, hope these bits go to the next carnival stream.
[367:59.38]I mean, I kind of just answer questions from anybody.
[368:07.80]And if you are heroes, I can't believe I'm your hero.
[368:22.21]Yeah, I mean, yeah.
[368:23.27]I'm not going to be around for a while.
[368:26.55]After tonight.
[368:28.17]Actually, it's getting late, too.
[368:30.15]So, I'll be gone for TwitchCon.
[368:32.71]But, if you have a couple of questions, yeah, fuck it.
[368:35.87]Yeah, sure.
[368:39.33]Hit up one of the mods, and I will answer a couple of your questions.
[368:47.53]Stream from TwitchCon.
[368:53.05]Last stream before retirement.
[368:54.25]No.

[369:09.59]September birthdays.
[369:10.43]There's a lot of them.
[369:10.99]The carnival stream was a delight, even though it started at 2 a.m.
[369:13.69]for me.
[369:14.57]Thanks for being the best streamer of all time.
[369:15.89]Love you.
[369:16.73]Thank you.
[369:20.02]Thank you, LowFatSugar.

[370:00.16]Oh, okay.
[370:03.64]By the way, I heard his live show is insane.
[370:08.27]I was told, go see Eric Andre live.
[370:10.89]Because I think his show is hilarious.
[370:14.71]I was told to see it live because it's insane live.
[370:17.27]It is.
[370:17.61]It is.
[370:18.01]Okay.
[370:18.78]That means I have to see it.
[370:22.36]I have to see it.
[370:23.00]Okay.
[370:23.54]Okay.
[370:24.65]It's a long time.
[370:25.25]I think some of you guys forget that this is going on almost ten years.
[370:27.13]Eight, nine years.
[370:55.34]That is a long time.
[370:59.46]Thank you.
[371:00.46]For the 250.
[371:04.18]And thanks for sticking around for that long, because it's been a long time.
[371:09.16]When is season 10?
[371:11.40]I gotta be careful going over season 10.
[371:13.00]That's when all shows start to suck.
[371:15.74]I've gotta be very careful.
[371:17.16]Gotta work on that.
[371:21.49]Thank you, Wembley, for the 250.
[371:24.28]Hey, Jerma, I started watching your streams a few months ago after YouTube recommended me your stuff.
[371:27.80]That's cool.
[371:29.17]I wish that I was following years ago.
[371:31.45]Love your stuff.
[371:31.89]One of the best entertaining streamers on here.
[371:34.43]Thanks, Wembley.
[371:39.09]I'm glad you found the channel.
[371:42.30]Hopefully you stick around.
[371:45.84]Hey, Zoidberg, thanks for the $5, Zoidberg.
[371:49.06]Can you say hi to BananaFish?
[371:50.64]They love your content.
[371:51.66]Hey, what's going on, BananaFish?
[371:54.45]Heard you love the content.
[371:57.56]Sick.
[372:00.40]Thank you Zoidberg for the 500 bits.
[372:02.00]Thank you HeyDocs for the 500 bits!
[372:06.35]That's a lot of money tonight.
[372:10.59]When the after stream hangout session is more than an hour or two long, you guys are just so... You guys are showering me in money and praise.
[372:23.31]Thank you, guys.
[372:24.31]Seriously.
[372:34.86]Sometimes I don't know what to say.
[372:37.06]Thank you.
[372:39.01]But, hey docs, no message, just 500 bits from hey docs.
[372:43.65]Thank you.
[372:46.57]Flugboy, thanks for the $5.
[372:48.60]I was just reminded of the hospital clowns.
[372:51.48]I actually had clown doctors perform in front of me after I donated my bone marrow, and I honestly thought I was fever dreaming.
[372:58.20]But one of them was actually the one that operated on me.
[373:01.39]Still a what-the-fuck moment for me.
[373:04.93]Wait, what?
[373:06.83]Hold on.
[373:09.24]He thought one of the... Wait, what?
[373:11.58]Was it real?
[373:12.64]Wait, what happened?
[373:19.36]A clown... Clown hospital.
[373:22.50]Clown doctors.
[373:26.95]Clown doctors are a thing?
[373:30.95]It was actually happening.
[373:32.25]Okay.
[373:34.19]That's interesting.
[373:40.05]Thank you, Flugboy, for the five bucks.
[373:42.35]Thank you, Volpixels, for the 275.
[373:45.11]Carnival stream was insanely good.
[373:46.31]I haven't been watching for long.
[373:48.09]But I can honestly say you're the best streamer I've watched.
[373:50.45]So keep it up, dude.
[373:52.83]However long you've been watching, thanks for watching as long as you have.
[373:55.93]Whether it's a week, a month, or ten years.
[373:57.79]Thank you.
[374:00.03]Hope you stick around.
[374:02.09]Freddy Dread, thanks for the ten dollars.
[374:03.83]No message, just thousand bits from Freddy Dread.
[374:07.84]Snoozencopter $2.50 250 bits your accident sounds even more horrible than mine.
[374:13.26]I don't know about that because Being in a car with the kind of that shell around you I don't know getting actually hit by a car out of a car sounds insanely traumatizing so
[374:30.08]Sounds like you got really lucky, too.
[374:31.50]I did.
[374:32.36]What I forgot to mention, by the way, is that the person that hit me didn't even stop or get out.
[374:36.88]Maybe they stopped, but I didn't see it because it was dark.
[374:39.56]But I even had to cancel the trip on the scooter and stand there, wait for the app to authorize it.
[374:46.33]Wait, what?
[374:47.79]You'd stand there and wait for the app to authorize the trip on the scooter?
[374:51.33]What?
[374:54.11]What?
[374:58.60]And somebody just... Did you end up catching them?
[375:03.17]Did they find out who it was?
[375:08.77]That's fucking horrible.
[375:10.05]Oh my god.
[375:16.34]What's wrong with people?
[375:28.53]But hopefully you did not get too badly hurt, Snoozycopter, seriously.
[375:40.02]And I would do the necessary things to try to figure out what happened there, because that's not alright.
[375:50.64]There might be a camera there somewhere that's possible to pull.
[375:57.28]Don't let somebody fucking get away with that.
[376:06.03]That's fucking horrible.
[376:09.43]I'm alright, I can walk, etc.
[376:10.93]Hopefully you don't have anything that comes out of that.
[376:16.89]It sounds like you're gonna be alright.
[376:26.48]Hopefully, wish you a swift recovery.
[376:31.39]But thank you.
[376:33.65]Mostly lost.
[376:34.17]Thanks for the $2.50.
[376:35.03]Somebody said the stream's been over for two hours.
[376:36.87]Sometimes it happens like this.
[376:38.07]Usually this is about 30 to 40 minutes.
[376:40.95]Somewhere between 30 plus minutes or so.
[376:43.78]But I've been gone for a long time.
[376:48.48]But thank you.
[376:48.94]Mostly lost for the $2.50.
[376:50.02]Jeremy, I was driving through Dallas the other night.
[377:03.21]Thanks for the $2.50.
[377:03.89]Appreciate it.
[377:12.29]Thanks for the $2.50.
[377:13.13]Thank you, Smellyboy, for the $2.50.
[377:15.13]Thoughts on people who ride their bikes in the car lane?
[377:25.13]Um... It depends.
[377:28.17]If there's a bike lane, they use the bike lane.
[377:32.91]You gotta be careful with cyclists, though.
[377:36.74]Some cyclists are really, really, really good and really smart.
[377:39.70]Sometimes... Sometimes that cyclist doesn't have reflective gear on.
[377:44.78]Sometimes that cyclist is kind of just riding their bike on the road.
[377:49.18]You've gotta be careful.
[377:58.15]Especially at night.
[378:10.28]But you share the road.
[378:14.97]And if you're a cyclist, you know, you gotta share the road too.
[378:18.35]We're all just... We're all just trying to get to fucking Baskin Robbins.
[378:22.29]All of us.
[378:23.35]To get those delicious 250 flavors.
[378:32.09]Share the road.
[378:35.30]Hey...
[378:38.14]DC Pro, thanks for the 265.
[378:39.64]$2.65.
[378:39.70]Hey, Jerma, fantastic fucking carnival, dude.
[378:44.48]I live in San Diego, so let me know if you need a good tour guide.
[378:48.08]I am not going to be in San Diego for very long, unfortunately.
[378:56.71]Because of the trip that I just was on, and because of the nature of the last stream that I did before this,
[379:08.16]I didn't want to take that much more time off, because there was almost a full five days before the carnival, where I just kind of wasn't around.
[379:16.99]And then I didn't want to have it be, ah, so, okay, Thursday, I'm gone.
[379:21.03]And then Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, I wanted to be back.
[379:25.97]And plus, I've been traveling.
[379:28.01]It was a lot of work that had to get done last week.
[379:32.35]I have a lot of real life shit that you guys don't really even know about that I have to do, too.
[379:37.90]So it's been very, very busy and hectic.
[379:40.72]So I really am only going to be in San Diego for like 24 hours, essentially.
[379:50.05]Because I didn't want to disappear again for like five days.
[379:56.76]But, like I said, Saturday's the day.
[379:58.58]Saturday morning into Saturday afternoon is when you'll find me.
[380:02.25]There's a lot of other stuff that's going on that I haven't talked about at all.
[380:06.49]Nothing bad.
[380:07.49]These are good things.
[380:08.31]But still, just lots of stuff.
[380:11.96]This has been like the busiest September, I think, in the last few years.
[380:16.66]Without a doubt it is.
[380:20.02]I need to run the credits, but I have a new setup here.
[380:24.79]Can I even run these credits?
[380:27.23]I hope so.
[380:33.68]Really?
[380:36.04]It's just here.
[380:37.33]That's not the credits.
[380:39.33]That is a goose in a lake.
[380:48.89]Let me delete that.
[380:51.11]Well, you know, we'll keep it here.
[380:52.27]Alright, here come the credits.
[380:56.52]If you don't know what the credits are, the credits are the subs that were on this stream.
[381:04.21]Holy shit.
[381:07.15]Holy shit.
[381:08.17]That's the fastest it's ever gone.
[381:11.59]This is the fastest it's ever been ever since I started live streaming.
[381:17.29]No way.
[381:22.50]That's too fast.
[381:28.56]Oh my god.
[381:29.48]How many subs we're in today?
[381:34.78]That's going 100 miles per hour.
[381:42.18]Somebody keep an eye on that because that really might be the fastest it's ever gone.
[381:46.76]Thank you so much, everybody.
[381:48.22]New people, old people, especially the old people, because I'm old.
[381:56.03]You get to be 34 with me.
[382:00.84]no some of you guys have subbed for years and some of you new subs just came in maybe you'll maybe you'll stick around maybe you won't appreciate it nonetheless thank you so much for yourself the uber pikachu thanks for the bits what's your opinion on the original spider-man trilogy uh one and two are fantastic three is not very good at all hopefully that answers your question
[382:27.46]Leatherjacket, thanks for the thousand bits.
[382:30.84]One of our mods here.
[382:32.40]Leatherjacket.
[382:34.10]One of our original mods.
[382:37.63]Sorry I didn't get to talk to you the day of.
[382:40.15]I hope your birthday was awesome.
[382:41.41]It was.
[382:43.61]It was great.
[382:45.25]Thank you.
[382:47.51]And thanks for the ten bucks, too.
[382:50.73]Thanks for being a fucking sick mod.
[382:53.97]I mean that.
[382:58.46]Snoozenkofter, thanks for the 250.
[382:59.79]I wasn't even done with my last message and the bits cost so much more now I didn't even know.
[383:04.77]5,000 bits costs 100 euros now.
[383:10.65]What?
[383:12.97]Wait.
[383:16.57]5,000 bits costs 100 euros?
[383:18.91]Are you serious?
[383:26.46]Instead of... It used to be 70.
[383:34.21]My god.
[383:46.09]Why is it always... Let me ask you this.
[383:48.82]Why is it always NA to EU?
[383:51.32]It just costs way more money.
[383:54.74]To ship things to you guys is like a shitload of money.
[384:01.91]To sell things to you guys is a shitload of money.
[384:08.49]What is going on with NA to every other country on Earth?
[384:20.34]It used to be good.
[384:27.19]I was here all the time.
[384:28.03]Oh, hey, man.
[384:29.79]Got the t-shirt.
[384:31.09]Oh, cool.
[384:31.87]Yeah, it was $86.
[384:36.20]What?
[384:40.14]That's an expensive t-shirt.
[384:46.47]I had to pay $20 for shipping on the Dota 2 Special Edition that was $80 to start with.
[384:57.94]That's fucking crazy.
[385:01.65]Hey.
[385:03.11]Guys.
[385:04.63]Do you... I mean, we're at the end of the stream here, pretty much.
[385:07.41]But, like, do you really need me to go on a cryptocurrency rant about BTC?
[385:12.59]Do you really want me to do that?
[385:15.03]Do you really want to hear that right now?
[385:25.53]No, you don't.
[385:29.25]Thank you, but snooze and copter, as they say, that's the first time in an American hospital.
[385:33.45]So after all, it was an experience worth telling about.
[385:35.49]And my girlfriend supported me through the whole thing.
[385:38.77]The reason I even came here, and I'm very happy I did, life is full of surprises.
[385:43.76]She still hates you, by the way.
[385:45.62]Happy belated birthday, you rock old man.
[385:51.46]Tell her not to hate me.
[385:53.97]What did I ever do?
[385:55.75]I didn't do anything.
[386:00.34]BitConnect.
[386:01.92]Yeah.
[386:03.80]But, thank you, Snoozen.
[386:06.68]Thanks for the birthday wishes, and really hope that you have a swift recovery here, because that's fucking crazy.
[386:12.75]Hey, the Uber Pikachu, thank you for the 300 bits.
[386:16.45]Hey, Jerma, just wanted to let you know, you want to know your opinion on the original Spider-Man trilogy.
[386:20.96]What?
[386:22.88]Also, really good PogChamp stream.
[386:25.74]Keep up the great work.
[386:28.14]I want to...
[386:30.52]The first one's good, the second one's great, and the third one's not good at all.
[386:34.66]Didn't I just do this?
[386:36.08]Did I?
[386:36.34]Am I losing my mind?
[386:44.98]Hey!
[386:46.20]Go 90!
[386:47.13]Thanks for the 250.
[386:48.01]I was hoping my 6'4 boyfriend could meet you at TwitchCon so you could finally prove you are indeed a 6'4 plus gentleman.
[386:53.93]Unfortunately, his trip has been cancelled.
[386:57.29]After the Thomas Cook collapse...
[387:02.06]Hope we can see you next year.
[387:03.16]Also, holy shit, the carnival stream was amazing.
[387:08.78]What?
[387:09.04]Wait, what happened?
[387:19.93]What?
[387:28.79]Hold on a second.
[387:29.73]What?
[387:39.35]So wait, they just like shut it all down?
[387:47.56]It's an airline that just went out of business.
[387:50.82]And that's it.
[387:53.34]No.
[387:58.11]The airline shut down before doing any return flights.
[388:02.01]How's that even possible?
[388:13.95]aircrews were stranded after Thomas cook collapsed so what they just like they just said that's it and that's it and then what would that's so that's insane well hopefully maybe maybe you'll see you next year that's not that sucks that's really up I'm gonna look more into this after the stream I'm gonna read about this this is crazy
[388:44.69]Hey, Pigeon.
[388:45.41]Thank you, Pigeon, for the $2.50.
[388:46.29]I donated it at the beginning of the stream and you have yet to read it.
[388:49.31]Not like this.
[388:51.31]Yeah, I was going to go back and scroll, but you guys just continue to shower me with fucking cash.
[388:58.51]And I can't say anything but thank you.
[389:02.31]You guys are just tons of money, tons of subs.
[389:05.07]Did you see the subs that went by?
[389:07.49]It's fucking insane.
[389:10.06]It's insane.
[389:13.96]Aw shit, this shampoo is great!
[389:15.34]That's an old one, I like that.
[389:18.22]Oh wait, I gotta go back to... uh... here.
[389:24.07]There's the janitor.
[389:25.83]Cleaning it up.
[389:28.09]Over 800 subs today?
[389:31.21]Are you serious?
[389:35.01]Oh my fucking god.
[389:37.94]What the fuck?
[389:46.95]I'm telling you, less than a few months are gonna go by before you see another stream like this.
[390:02.03]Quite the amount.
[390:02.71]Yeah, for real it is.
[390:03.79]But anyways, they say, to reiterate, I'm so goddamn excited to meet and follow you around.
[390:09.35]It's gonna make my year.
[390:10.89]Also, I recently found the amazing world of paid clown jobs.
[390:14.11]And I absolutely love the dynamic duo you had on stream.
[390:17.63]I'm assuming you hired them.
[390:18.83]Yes, they were incredible.
[390:20.73]Any chance you can give them a shoutout?
[390:22.09]I'd love to look into them and what they do.
[390:26.00]I'm probably... There's gonna be a stream where I wanna bring on some video.
[390:32.65]some behind-the-scenes pictures and stuff, I think, that were taken.
[390:37.17]This is after TwitchCon, because I don't have time to really set it up right now.
[390:43.06]But they were fantastic.
[390:44.26]They really were.
[390:46.12]And to answer your first question, you will be able to follow me around for about two or three hours.
[390:52.46]Because that's as long as I'm going to be on the show floor, because then I fucking leave in TwitchCon.
[391:02.39]That's as long as I will be at the show, essentially.
[391:10.19]What if I just, like, fucking sprinted away and, like, darted behind a bush or something?
[391:13.47]Alright, yeah, I'm going this way!
[391:18.86]Like, I'm playing a fucking, like, stealth game.
[391:22.70]Hide from everybody.
[391:27.58]He's buffed it.
[391:28.12]He's gonna head out.
[391:30.06]Just be the goose.
[391:32.32]He's scared of meeting fans.
[391:34.72]No.
[391:36.06]If you think I'm scared of meeting fans, you know I've done this.
[391:38.68]You know it's been almost 10 years now, right?
[391:42.84]I've done probably two dozen meet and greets, so no.
[391:48.50]I'm just not going to be there for very long.
[391:56.19]You don't want to meet us.
[391:59.37]Sad it's me face.
[392:05.55]No.
[392:06.47]I'll be around Saturday all morning into the early afternoon.
[392:09.39]Then I gotta get out of there.
[392:11.39]Because I have some stuff to do.
[392:13.60]Stuff that I haven't talked about.
[392:17.02]It may be beneficial.
[392:17.88]I'm gonna be meeting people.
[392:20.96]I'm gonna be greeting people.
[392:23.28]Not just fans of the channel.
[392:25.58]Other streamers.
[392:26.96]Maybe some networking.
[392:28.53]I'm gonna... You know what I'm saying?
[392:31.29]Let's go.
[392:34.19]Secrets.
[392:34.65]No, no secrets.
[392:39.05]Hey, Noricom, thanks for the thousand bits.
[392:41.65]How is Burger Boy, by the way?
[392:42.97]Burger Boy's, I think, doing pretty well.
[392:45.47]He's got a family.
[392:48.81]He has children.
[392:56.00]But, I am going to go back.
[393:00.40]Because that is the end of the bits.
[393:01.64]That is the end of the stream.
[393:03.14]But let me go back earlier here.
[393:05.52]Make sure I didn't miss anything else.
[393:08.34]Which I don't think I did.
[393:09.64]Because it was right about here.
[393:20.46]Yeah, I remember Bake Me Home.
[393:23.64]I remember Smelly Boy.
[393:24.84]I remember... Zake?
[393:33.25]Uh, the Cap David gave 646 bits.
[393:38.10]I think I missed this one from earlier.
[393:39.50]They say, happy belated birthday.
[393:41.58]I hope it went well.
[393:42.26]Second, the carnival stream was the most amazing thing I've seen ever.
[393:45.60]And I don't know how long.
[393:46.82]You nailed it.
[393:47.62]Seriously, kudos.
[393:49.03]It was super fun dunking you three times.
[393:50.93]And third, thank you.
[393:52.99]Thank you for all those years of entertainment.
[393:54.33]Thank you for inspiring me.
[393:56.03]Thank you for helping me through those very tough times in my life.
[393:58.61]Thank you for everything.
[393:59.27]Seriously, dude.
[394:02.61]Thank you for watching, and thank you for enabling me to do this.
[394:07.05]Thank you for allowing me to do this.
[394:14.87]When thousands and thousands of people all give their hard-earned money to one person, that's how I'm able to do that.
[394:33.63]You know what I mean?
[394:39.98]And I'm going to do what I can, you know?
[394:44.54]As long as I can.
[394:51.10]And that's going to be my time for tonight.
[394:55.60]Kind of a long one today.
[394:57.38]But like I said earlier, sort of had to be.
[395:01.56]You haven't seen me.
[395:02.87]Truthfully, I haven't sat down here and truthfully hung out for about six or seven days.
[395:08.23]Eight days, so.
[395:10.91]I love doing the long ones.
[395:13.99]I need to get some food.
[395:15.29]I have some packing to do.
[395:17.16]And then tomorrow, we are gonna do a shorter one tomorrow.
[395:23.24]I gotta stop clapping.
[395:24.20]What am I clapping for?
[395:25.70]Why am I, like, clapping?
[395:28.62]We're gonna do a short one tomorrow.
[395:34.07]Less than probably a few hours.
[395:35.19]Three, four, five hours.
[395:36.11]Something like that.
[395:37.25]Tops.
[395:41.25]Cut his mic.
[395:41.99]What do you mean cut my mic?
[395:43.49]Why do you want to cut my mic?
[395:48.57]Fingernails.
[395:49.03]Fingernails.
[395:49.49]Fingernails.
[395:49.85]Thank you.
[395:50.19]Thank you.
[395:50.55]Alright.
[395:51.03]I'm out of here.
[395:52.90]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[395:57.12]Take care.
[395:57.72]Much love.
[395:58.42]Thank you for all the insane support.
[396:01.36]I'm glad you liked the fucking carnival stream.
[396:05.51]See you soon.
[396:07.71]Raid.
[396:08.05]Raid somebody.
[396:08.71]Raid Etalyx.
[396:09.39]Raid.
[396:10.27]Raid.
[396:13.82]You know what?
[396:14.24]Here.
[396:14.44]How about this?
[396:17.02]Who's streaming right now?
[396:19.70]Who's streaming right now?
[396:20.48]What do we have?
[396:31.68]It takes so damn long for my page to open.
[396:36.13]We got... Everybody's streaming right now.
[396:41.65]Vinny.
[396:42.47]Kryken.
[396:44.33]Vitalix.
[396:48.92]Who else is streaming?
[396:55.32]Hey, you know what?
[396:55.84]Check this shit out.
[397:03.33]Rate somebody with one viewer.
[397:14.76]No, I... That's... I don't know.
[397:18.32]I don't know if I want to do that.
[397:20.36]Surprise somebody?
[397:25.40]That might freak somebody out.
[397:30.78]I can't imagine if you had one viewer and all of a sudden, like, a thousand fucking people showed up.
[397:35.27]It might scare the shit out of you.
[397:50.81]One... No, no, no, no, no.
[397:53.95]Go say hello to Etalyx.
[397:55.09]We'll raid Etalyx.
[398:04.74]What's he doing?
[398:06.44]Kenshi?
[398:09.32]Should be interesting.
[398:10.00]Alright.
[398:13.32]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[398:14.50]Short stream tomorrow.
[398:15.52]Have a good one.
[398:20.42]By the way, this is, I think Etalyx.
[398:22.05]This is like late game Kenshi, by the way.
[398:25.59]I'm gonna clip my nails, I will.
[398:26.79]Don't worry.
[398:27.53]I've got it.
[398:28.01]I've got it under control.
[398:29.97]See you tomorrow.
[398:34.05]Did it not work?
[398:38.41]Okay, that was weird.
[398:40.54]Alright, goodbye.
[398:42.78]See you later.
[398:44.18]Take care.
[398:50.02]And just, like, swear in his chat.
[398:51.94]Just say, like, shit and, like, piss.
[398:57.19]You guys are all gonna get fucking banned.
[398:59.45]Alright, goodnight.
[399:03.53]See you tomorrow.
