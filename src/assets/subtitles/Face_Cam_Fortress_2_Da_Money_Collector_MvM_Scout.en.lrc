[00:09.02]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.63]Jeremiah here with Basecamp Fortress 2.
[00:13.95]And I'm here with a couple of other dudes.
[00:15.93]Of course, Shibby 2142 and MLC_St3alth.
[00:17.61]Go ahead and introduce yourselves, dudes.
[00:20.11]What's going on, guys?
[00:21.13]Shib's here.
[00:22.13]Hey, guys.
[00:22.71]Shibby 2142 here.
[00:23.19]Okay.
[00:25.97]So, yeah, we're playing some man up mode.
[00:28.85]So that means we're spending tickets and we're doing this on cool town.
[00:32.35]Which one are we doing?
[00:32.95]CPU slaughter or?
[00:34.29]Oh, this is, I think this is CPU slaughter.
[00:39.20]It's not control alt delete.
[00:40.18]I don't think.
[00:40.64]Yeah, it is.
[00:41.00]If you hold tab, you can see.
[00:42.98]So, yeah, we're just waiting for a Jerma to ready up.
[00:45.62]For me.
[00:45.96]There you go.
[00:46.30]A little sniper action going on here.
[00:51.16]playing as the Scout.
[00:52.60]Stealth, what are you, the Demoman?
[00:54.16]Mm-hmm, yeah.
[00:55.08]Ooh, look at that little thing you got.
[00:58.24]I guess my joke wasn't very funny about me saying I should be 2140 soon.
[01:00.59]Nobody laughed.
[01:04.77]No, I was very insensitive.
[01:06.31]Sorry.
[01:08.69]Just kidding, I love you.
[01:09.93]Get rid of the tank, get rid of the tank.
[01:12.43]Shoot it.
[01:12.73]Look at those heavies, though.
[01:16.38]Oh, heavies in the back.
[01:17.32]Oh, lag.
[01:19.83]Yikes.
[01:20.63]I'm gonna go behind those guys.
[01:23.61]Try and take out those medics.
[01:25.09]Actually, yeah, I'm not doing a whole lot of damage.
[01:28.49]Both medics down.
[01:29.49]Oh, man.
[01:30.55]That's not a good idea.
[01:31.47]Come on.
[01:35.07]Oh, snipers.
[01:36.89]Look at how many people are down there right now.
[01:41.50]I got some crazy hit detection going on here.
[01:44.38]Give me the money!
[01:44.96]Give me the money!
[01:46.64]Oh, there's a lot of money down here.
[01:48.50]So many kills.
[01:49.28]Yeah, there's a ton of money down by those heavies.
[01:51.74]Yeah, I just picked up a lot.
[01:52.74]There's one more little piece of money.
[01:54.90]So the viewers know, what load are you guys rocking right now?
[01:59.74]I am using the cool sticky launcher, and that's it.
[02:04.83]I'm using the force of nature, the Mad Milk, and the candy cane to get that health from killing these robots.
[02:13.24]I'm using the heat maker.
[02:14.86]Oh, yeah.
[02:15.88]Pretty interesting once you get the focus.
[02:18.48]Alright, we got all the money.
[02:19.79]Watch out for the sniper!
[02:21.87]I didn't kill him right there.
[02:23.17]I have so many of the sniper men.
[02:24.49]Watch the, oh my god, right side.
[02:26.09]Right side, there's a ton of people.
[02:28.09]They're all slugging over there right now.
[02:31.17]They're all going up the ramp.
[02:32.71]Oh, my God.
[02:34.65]Oh, go, go.
[02:35.59]I'm trying to pick up the money.
[02:37.55]I'm just, like, hiding back here, trying to pick up money.
[02:40.65]Oh, my gosh.
[02:41.33]All the heavies.
[02:41.86]Yeah, I know.
[02:42.34]There's a million people there.
[02:43.66]There should be.
[02:46.34]We got the money?
[02:47.92]What are we missing?
[02:48.40]What are we missing?
[02:49.68]Oh, four snipers.
[02:51.08]Oh.
[02:51.96]Where's this last piece of money?
[02:53.74]Where's this $13?
[02:54.02]Got it.
[02:56.51]Alright.
[02:57.10]Yeah, there's just a bunch of snipers now.
[02:58.68]This guy right here.
[02:59.84]Got him.
[03:00.70]Another one up here.
[03:01.74]Don't kill me, please.
[03:03.28]Oh, my God.
[03:05.91]Oh, my God.
[03:06.35]Where is he?
[03:07.13]I got him.
[03:07.49]He's dead.
[03:07.91]Okay.
[03:08.81]They don't drop money, right?
[03:10.89]Nope.
[03:11.15]Wait, who are the snipers now?
[03:12.13]The snipers don't.
[03:12.79]So where's this $13? $13.
[03:15.34]I just killed a medic down there.
[03:18.56]I just got killed by seven snipers.
[03:19.98]I see it.
[03:21.14]Did I get it?
[03:22.37]Oh, did I not?
[03:23.55]There's more money somewhere.
[03:24.53]Over here.
[03:25.03]Give me it.
[03:27.31]I didn't get it all.
[03:28.21]There's nothing I can do.
[03:31.75]Go attack all those heavies, Jerma.
[03:33.05]What do you think?
[03:34.15]I'm going to go buy myself and get myself smoked.
[03:38.44]Man, oh man.
[03:39.26]Where'd that money go?
[03:40.36]Jerma, did you say what you were using for a loadout?
[03:42.52]No, I didn't get it.
[03:43.14]What?
[03:43.46]What?
[03:44.71]yeah I said the force of nature I'm covered in pee right now I'm just trying to kill this stupid medic right here this medic is dead medic is dead these freaking heavies man I swear to god we're still missing that 13 we're gonna miss it till the end oh well drama
[04:11.66]Sorry.
[04:12.46]I bet you saw it on the ground and you just didn't walk over to it because you didn't want to pick it up.
[04:15.82]I don't understand why I'm getting a pocket medic as sniper, but... Die!
[04:24.22]What else?
[04:24.96]Oh, stealth.
[04:25.72]You just died, man.
[04:27.98]Who put that gravity in the server?
[04:29.34]Alright, I'm pretty much all decked out in this resistance.
[04:36.86]And...
[04:39.80]I could go with super movement speed.
[04:40.91]I'm not even touching this really at all.
[04:43.57]I'm just going for like super money collection, but time to beef this thing up a little bit.
[04:48.97]Mm-hmm.
[04:49.87]Because I got all my resistances all the way up.
[04:55.36]Bang, bang.
[04:57.62]Alright.
[05:00.22]Ready when you guys are with spy support.
[05:02.16]That is the worst.
[05:03.98]Spy sapping my bum.
[05:06.86]Ow.
[05:07.56]He sapped my bum.
[05:11.40]So, is this video going up while we're at Paxton?
[05:14.38]It is.
[05:15.42]It's going to be going up on Friday.
[05:18.00]Okay.
[05:19.82]So, happy Friday, if you're seeing this.
[05:21.58]Happy TGIF.
[05:24.56]Thank Gaben, it's Friday.
[05:28.33]Wait a minute, are you putting this up on Friday as well?
[05:31.75]Yeah, I'll do it.
[05:32.75]Alright, well then, hey.
[05:34.75]What did I have scheduled for Friday?
[05:36.41]I think I had a Daisy helicopter video.
[05:41.99]We could always say it's any of the days of the week.
[05:44.81]Yeah, so go watch that video if you haven't seen it yet.
[05:46.51]It's probably up now.
[05:49.35]Link below in the description.
[05:51.75]I wouldn't say go that far.
[05:52.91]Just, you know, like, favorite, subscribe.
[05:55.65]You might find it.
[05:56.17]Alright, I didn't even see what we had this round.
[05:59.54]Two big heavies, two big soldiers.
[06:01.18]All I saw was spy support.
[06:02.42]I cried.
[06:02.72]I cried.
[06:06.64]Get the money, get the money.
[06:07.68]Oh, for those of you watching right now, this is something I did not even know and why I never wanted to play Scout for Man vs. Machine.
[06:13.38]You get overhealed for every single dollar you collect.
[06:16.70]I did not know that.
[06:17.36]Yeah, so you probably have like 500 health right now, right?
[06:19.33]Yeah, I got over 400 right now.
[06:20.37]It's just like, are you serious?
[06:21.49]That's insanity.
[06:22.39]Spy support.
[06:24.29]Wow.
[06:25.23]Oh, that was a spy right there.
[06:26.39]I thought they spawned behind us.
[06:27.37]They do.
[06:29.11]That guy just spawned right in my face.
[06:31.75]That guy legit was just right in my face.
[06:32.99]These spies are smart, man.
[06:34.93]Yeah, they... Get up.
[06:36.64]Huge upper hand.
[06:37.84]Give me the money.
[06:38.24]Did I get it all?
[06:40.14]I didn't.
[06:41.14]Yeah, no, I didn't.
[06:41.90]It's up here.
[06:44.14]Oh, there's still $22 missing.
[06:45.34]Where is it?
[06:46.52]Oh, I couldn't have even gotten it.
[06:47.90]It was all the way back here, behind the, uh... Oh, no, we got it.
[06:49.98]Oh, really?
[06:50.62]No, we got it, we got it.
[06:51.40]That was weird.
[06:51.80]That was, like, a weird glitch.
[06:54.39]Oh, yeah, I got it.
[06:55.01]I have no health.
[06:56.69]Gosh.
[06:57.77]Oh, thanks for mad-moking those.
[06:58.85]I actually got health back because of that.
[07:01.56]That's what I'm here for.
[07:02.64]He's almost dead.
[07:03.78]Yeah, just get rid of him.
[07:09.45]Yeah, yeah, yeah, you did it!
[07:11.37]Hooray!
[07:12.73]More, more spy, okay, watch out.
[07:14.45]They like spawn on us.
[07:16.45]Oh, if you're watching this video and you're wondering why, if you're wondering why I keep hitting tab to look at the scoreboard, I'm looking at the money collected.
[07:24.44]See in the lower left, collected and missed?
[07:26.16]That's so I can tell if I've missed any money.
[07:30.06]Oh!
[07:30.54]Oh my god!
[07:31.24]I just went a thousand feet in the air!
[07:33.78]Help me!
[07:36.44]Die!
[07:38.88]Geez, that's a lot.
[07:40.90]This guy's coming to milk.
[07:42.78]If you can stand, peeking your nose out for a second.
[07:46.60]Hey rockets.
[07:48.26]Money, money, money, and more money.
[07:49.96]Yeah, just try to pick those medics off.
[07:53.22]Oh, there's a bunch of money back here.
[07:55.97]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[07:56.79]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[07:58.79]Bomb.
[08:00.23]Alright, these guys both have used their uber.
[08:03.25]Trying to kill the medic.
[08:05.03]If only I had more.
[08:06.65]Yes, run.
[08:08.81]Alright, that guy does not have any more medics on the right.
[08:10.96]Neither does this old... No, he just ubered.
[08:15.02]Damn it.
[08:16.90]That was a spy, for sure.
[08:19.23]Got all the money so far.
[08:20.21]You guys alright over there?
[08:23.69]No.
[08:24.33]Yes.
[08:26.53]No, this medic just ubered.
[08:28.03]I didn't get him.
[08:29.15]So we have a giant heavy.
[08:30.83]Just focus on the soldier.
[08:32.09]He still has a medic on him.
[08:35.16]Our bomb is about to be destroyed.
[08:39.40]I got the medic.
[08:40.16]We get all the money, right?
[08:41.86]Yeah, we do.
[08:44.44]That makes me happy.
[08:45.58]That makes me real happy.
[08:47.00]A ton of scouts on the left.
[08:48.52]Holy crap.
[08:51.57]Oh, just... Don't let him in!
[08:54.71]Do not let these bastards in.
[08:57.77]This is it.
[08:58.51]This is it.
[08:59.05]There's a spy.
[08:59.71]There's a spy somewhere.
[09:00.51]Spies everywhere.
[09:01.21]Which one?
[09:02.11]Is that it?
[09:02.93]We won?
[09:04.05]Uh, one more.
[09:04.97]Last round.
[09:05.59]Oh, okay.
[09:06.21]Ooh, money.
[09:08.15]I was spending money like it was last wave.
[09:10.99]Oh, don't do that.
[09:12.33]Alright, um... Okay, I got fully upgraded that.
[09:18.36]Yeah, this sniper's a little OP.
[09:21.94]Clip size.
[09:24.16]And ready up.
[09:26.43]We'll go with that.
[09:27.73]Ah, no spy sport.
[09:28.81]Perfect.
[09:29.81]We're also gonna go with an Uber Canteen.
[09:32.27]Because I be like it.
[09:34.27]Alright, three tanks, two deflectors.
[09:36.77]Uh oh.
[09:38.23]Really?
[09:40.89]The tanks I'm not that worried about.
[09:42.25]Deflectors on the other hand?
[09:43.37]Yowza.
[09:45.75]Do deflectors come with three or more medics usually?
[09:51.07]Well, there's 18 total medics, so I'm assuming that they're going to be spread out.
[09:56.30]Six each?
[09:57.42]Nine each.
[09:59.02]Well, I mean, they could be on the heavies as well.
[10:01.84]The regular heavies.
[10:02.62]They're going to get on the tanks, yeah.
[10:05.32]Imagine if medics could be on tanks.
[10:07.62]That would be so unfair.
[10:09.64]That would be really easy because you'd kill the medic right away.
[10:12.89]They're all ubered the entire time.
[10:15.67]All 18 medics.
[10:18.09]You have to beat the wave before the tank with the uber gets to that.
[10:23.18]Alright, this is sniper support though.
[10:24.38]This could be a real pain in the ass.
[10:26.82]I'll try my best.
[10:27.50]Be careful.
[10:28.66]Facing snipers is so scary if there's like 10 at a time and like nobody has like killed the man.
[10:34.05]Yeah, it is pretty terrifying.
[10:37.95]Like the wave gets pushed back so all the snipers like merge into one position and you just like walk to the front lines and just... This is very true.
[10:47.30]And our heavy has invested in jump height.
[10:50.70]Wait, did he really?
[10:51.62]Wait, hold on.
[10:52.14]What?
[10:55.26]Oh my god.
[10:56.78]Well done.
[10:59.70]Just so we can do like a, what is it called?
[11:02.06]A triple Lutz?
[11:02.66]What's it called?
[11:03.06]I don't know.
[11:04.38]What's the ice skating move?
[11:05.72]I'm just watching his robot.
[11:06.96]That's the best part.
[11:07.86]What is that called?
[11:08.72]Triple Lutz?
[11:10.40]What the hell is it called?
[11:11.30]I thought it was like a Wongu.
[11:14.94]Triple Axel.
[11:15.50]Triple Axel.
[11:16.08]There you go.
[11:18.93]I saw the puzzle.
[11:20.39]Someone told me if you shoot the tracks on the sides, it does more damage.
[11:23.83]That person lied, too.
[11:25.55]Let's see.
[11:25.91]I don't think that's true.
[11:27.45]I don't know if it's true.
[11:30.89]I like to... We can pretend it's true, though.
[11:36.66]Oh, my God.
[11:38.38]Milk.
[11:39.90]I need to get that.
[11:40.66]Oh, I'm going to run right into the line of fire here.
[11:43.86]This is true.
[11:46.27]Actually, money is kind of important.
[11:47.93]Sniper, get at him!
[11:49.49]He's gonna kill me with his stupid club.
[11:52.69]Yeah, go ahead, try and hurt me.
[11:55.81]I got massive resistance, baby.
[11:59.87]Wait, what's this guy say about fake shibby?
[12:01.84]Oh, fake shibby just added me to friends.
[12:04.76]Really?
[12:05.18]That's nice.
[12:06.92]He's probably a cool guy.
[12:09.42]Oh, sniper!
[12:10.72]This guy's gonna try and club me again.
[12:13.74]Oh, these guys are all covered in milk.
[12:15.92]Have at it.
[12:16.32]It's a lot of rockets.
[12:19.22]Go from behind.
[12:21.52]Collect the money.
[12:22.30]Yeah!
[12:26.70]Snipers everywhere!
[12:28.34]Get... Oh, big heavy!
[12:32.08]Snipers.
[12:33.22]This is incredibly fun.
[12:34.78]Because I've... I've such... Oh, I'll kill them next.
[12:39.56]I'm gonna take care of the snipers.
[12:42.29]Taking care of the snipers.
[12:44.41]Got him.
[12:45.99]Another one over here, huh?
[12:48.03]Snipers are all gone.
[12:49.51]Just big heavy.
[12:50.35]He's dead.
[12:54.37]Yeah, make sure you use your money, because this is it.
[12:56.41]Oh my god, snipers literally all over the place.
[12:59.34]Shouldn't have used that milk.
[13:01.54]Jerma, are you even playing on our team?
[13:06.48]That Jerma is not one of us.
[13:08.87]That Jerma is an enemy.
[13:10.68]That sniper is not one of us.
[13:11.68]I see a bunch of lasers on Jerma right now.
[13:13.66]Yeah, big heavy on the left.
[13:14.80]Okay.
[13:16.88]And he's gonna be covered with milk.
[13:18.20]No, he's not.
[13:18.90]Not yet.
[13:21.38]Get that away.
[13:21.84]Let's not medic away.
[13:23.77]Medic is not dead.
[13:25.51]Yes, he's dead.
[13:26.95]Get health.
[13:27.63]Heal off of that guy.
[13:28.61]He's dead.
[13:30.73]Man, there are a lot of snipers in this round.
[13:33.25]Another tank.
[13:33.75]Another tank.
[13:35.73]Ton of soldiers, too.
[13:40.03]Oh my goodness.
[13:42.33]I just knocked that guy over the fence.
[13:45.58]No, no, are you serious?
[13:46.80]Get the... My god.
[13:48.98]What happened to you?
[13:50.08]I got stuck in a corner.
[13:53.34]With a bunch of... With one sniper.
[13:54.84]I was a bunch.
[13:56.24]Can I get rid of these scouts?
[13:59.42]That Jerma is not all of us.
[14:01.56]He is not.
[14:03.04]That Jerma is a piece of crap.
[14:05.38]Oh, rockets.
[14:07.24]Oh my god, framerate.
[14:11.64]No!
[14:11.98]I couldn't see the first spot.
[14:12.59]Give me that money, give me that money, give me that money.
[14:14.77]Oh, he's waving.
[14:16.39]Hi.
[14:17.15]Kill the stupid sniper!
[14:19.07]Oh, wow, that's a lot of snipers.
[14:20.67]Are you guys getting leg spikes every now and then?
[14:22.99]I am.
[14:23.45]I am.
[14:24.57]I am getting them.
[14:25.08]Oh, I gotta spend some money.
[14:25.78]Might as well buy back in.
[14:26.84]Get rid of that sentry bus!
[14:28.50]Go, go, go.
[14:30.90]Last tank.
[14:31.42]Do I got any milk yet?
[14:33.68]Nope.
[14:35.00]Oh, wow, I'm probably gonna die right here.
[14:37.43]No.
[14:38.07]I need to get some of that money.
[14:39.05]Is any money even, like, dropping?
[14:40.29]I feel like it's not even, like... I'm dead.
[14:43.01]I'm so dead.
[14:43.59]I covered him in milk, though.
[14:47.59]Yeah, I don't think... People aren't even, like, dropping money.
[14:50.95]I think I'm going crazy where I'm not seeing any money.
[14:53.97]Definitely that one.
[14:56.59]No, no one's dropping money, man.
[14:58.97]We have all the money.
[14:59.81]We have 700.
[15:00.99]Oh, yeah, hi.
[15:02.57]I don't know what this game is.
[15:06.57]So it's only s- okay, I get it.
[15:09.27]And we have one!
[15:11.25]And oh my god, what'd you get for items?
[15:12.35]What's up, guys?
[15:16.42]Splinted screen?!
[15:18.08]Oh, somebody had a Bower of Duty.
[15:24.06]Oh, cool.
[15:24.76]Somebody had a thing of duty.
[15:26.56]A surplus ticket.
[15:28.58]Thanks, H and G. Hell yeah.
[15:34.33]Thanks, dude.
[15:34.75]I got a Frontier of Justice, because it's good.
[15:39.50]Atomic Sloth, yes!
[15:41.80]We only missed $31 the whole time.
[15:43.48]We suck.
[15:44.58]Yeah, that was the very beginning.
[15:45.62]I blame our scout.
[15:48.57]I remember when Jerma forgot to get $13 that one time.
[15:52.21]I take all the blame.
[15:54.59]But, uh, yeah.
[15:55.73]Thanks a lot for watching, guys.
[15:56.59]Well played, gents.
[15:58.59]So, yeah, guys, that was CPU Slaughter, man-up mode.
[16:02.27]Man-up mode.
[16:03.55]Thank you guys for watching.
[16:04.81]And, yeah, hopefully we'll have some PAX videos and whatnot and some fun.
[16:09.28]That's pretty much it.
[16:10.02]So any last words, boys?
[16:11.98]No, just take care, everybody.
[16:13.62]See you all soon.
